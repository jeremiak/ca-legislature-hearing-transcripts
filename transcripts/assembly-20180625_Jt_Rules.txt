THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT SEEMS SO THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT WE'VE BEEN GROUND ZERO FOR THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF BUT WE SHOULD SEE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THE WRONGS OF THE PAST DON'T ONCE AGAIN BECOME OUR FUTURE. WE NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT PROTECT THOSE WHO MAY FACE THIS TOMORROW I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE LAST WEEK BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THAT THIS PROCESS CAN BE ADMINISTERED FAIRLY SWIFTLY AND THOUGHTFULLY. THAT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC STAFF AND MEMBERS EXPECT AND DESERVE. WELL I THINK SENATOR MITCHELL ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF YOUR DILIGENT EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE HEAD ON WELL MY PRIMARY CONCERNS IS TO ENSURE THAT ANY PROCESS WE PUT INTO PLACE IS CONSISTENT. NOT ONLY BETWEEN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY BUT CONSISTENCY AMONG ALL THOSE INVOLVED WHETHER THE SITUATION INVOLVES A JUNIOR STAFFER. OR MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE. THERE SHOULD BE A NOT BE ANY PERCEPTION OR REALITY OF FAVORITISM OR BIAS. CHANGING OUR POLICY TO ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS IS A GOOD START BUT CHANGING THE CULTURE IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL TALK IS CHEAP. THE CURRENT CULTURE AND POLITICS RIGHT NOW WHICH IS A CHARGED ENVIRONMENT. SO PROVING COMMUNICATIONS CIVILITY AND RESPECT IS A DEFINITE CHALLENGE BUT I KNOW UP TO THANK YOU AS CHAIRMAN VERY GOOD. ALL WITH FATS I WOULD INVITE -- CHAIR LAURA FRIEDMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY AND VICE CHAIR HOLLY MITCHELL OF THE SENATE. TO GO TO OUR DIETS AND COMMENCE YOUR PRESENTATION. OF YOUR SUB COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND CLIMATE SURVEY RESULTS. AND AGAIN WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK THESE PAST MONTHS IT WENT. THANK YOU OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BEFORE IF WE BEGIN I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A FEW THANK YOUS MYSELF THAT'S OKAY. I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK ALL OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THEIR MANY MANY MONTHS OF VERY VERY HARD WORK ON THIS DIFFICULT TOPIC. I WANT TO THANK SPEAKER RENDON PRO TEM ATKINS FOR THEIR AMAZING LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BOTH LEADERS OF BOTH HOUSES. WERE UNEQUIVOCAL IN SAYING THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE CALIFORNIA LEAD THE NATION IN CRAFTING THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. AND PROTECTIVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES IN THE NATION AND I THINK THAT WE'VE MADE A BIG STEP TOWARDS DOING THAT TODAY AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR LEADERSHIP AND OF COURSE CHAIRMAN COOLIES LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL. I WANT TO THANK THE MANY MEMBERS OF WE SAID ENOUGH WHO WERE THE ONES WHO REALLY BEGAN US ON THIS PATH THEIR BRAVERY AND STANDING UP AND TELLING THEIR STORIES. CAN'T BE UNDERSTATED AND THEY'RE THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY. I'M ALSO ALL OF THE STAFFERS FROM FROM THE LEGISLATURE WHO SENT. THEIR TESTIMONY IN ANONYMOUSLY WHO CAME TO THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS MANY OF THEM CAME TO MY OFFICE STOP ME IN THE HALL AND IT'S NOT EASY FOR A STAFFER TO PULL A MEMBER SIDE AND MAKE SUGGESTIONS LIKE THAT AND TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES AND I WANT TO COMMEND THEM. FOR NOT JUST THEIR BRAVERY BUT THEIR COMMITMENT TO HELPING THEIR COLLEAGUES -- AND THEN SUPPORTING THEM. GRANT WHO WAS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HIS VERY THOUGHTFUL GUIDANCE AND DILIGENCE AS WELL AS MY CHIEF ALISON ROTH WHO ALSO -- WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THIS PROCESS I WANT I THINK THE ASSEMBLY RULES COMMITTEE STAFF OUR CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER DEBRA GRAVERT DEPUTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER LEO LOPEZ HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR TASHA CHERRY. FOR EIGHT MONTHS THEY'VE REALLY BEEN UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR THEM. AND THEY HAVE THROUGH ALL OF IT MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PROFESSIONALISM AND MOST IMPORTANTLY COMPASSION AND CONCERN FOR THE EMPLOYEES THAT THEY REPRESENT. AND THERE ARE REAL TESTIMONY TO WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH AND I KNOW THAT BILL BE ABLE TO GUIDE THIS NEW POLICY IN THE DIRECTION THAT IT NEEDS TO GO BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE PROFESSIONALS. AND I'VE SAID BEFORE WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE THEM -- AS WE BEEF UP THIS POLICY IN CRATER NEW DEPARTMENT AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK -- I WANT TO THANK THE SENATE ARE SENATE PARTNERS A VICE CHAIR MITCHELL OF THE HOUSES DON'T OFTEN WORK TOGETHER IN THIS FASHION. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IS I'M A FRESHMAN BUT I'VE LEARNED THAT SOMETIMES NAVIGATING THOSE WATERS ON TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT EVERYBODY WORK TOGETHER EXTREMELY WELL. I'M BRINGING THEIR ISSUES FORWARD AND I THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE BICAMERAL NATURE OF THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE A MUCH STRONGER POLICY WITH A LOT MORE. PERSPECTIVES REALLY HAVE BEEN ON THE BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. AND LASTLY BEFORE I MOVE NOW TO THE ACTUAL PRESENTATION I WANNA SAY THAT ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE IS LEADING THE WAY AND I'VE LOOKED AT WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY OUT THERE THAT'S DONE AS COMPREHENSIVE A WAS A FRAMEWORK. WE'RE NOT GONNA WALK OUT OF THIS MEETING TODAY BEING ABLE TO SAY THAT WE SOLVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE LEGISLATURE. OR EVEN THAT WE HAVE THE PERFECT POLICY IN PLACE I THINK THAT WE'VE DONE IT IN A A REALLY -- COMPREHENSIVE JOB OF TRYING TO ALL OF THE IF FOR ASPECTS OF POLICY THAT IMPACTS SEXUAL HARASSMENT OTHER TYPES OF WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION. BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING KIND OF PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE PLACE WE'RE GOING. TO KIND OF PUSH IT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AS WE START TO BUILD OUT THAT POLICY FROM THIS FRAMEWORK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT OF EVALUATION OVER TIME AND PROBABLY QUITE A LOT OF FINE TUNING. AS IT SHOULD BE. BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE OR NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT PUTTING A OF VOTING ON A SET OF POLICIES AND SAYING THAT YOU'RE DONE. IT'S ABOUT STARTING THE BEGINNING OF A LONGER PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE DILIGENCE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A VALUATION. AND CERTAINLY IT'S GOING TO TAKE INTROSPECTION AND A LOT OF EFFORT ON EVERYONE'S BEHALF STARTING WITH OUR OWN OFFICES. NOW TO THE POWER POINT PRESENTATION. ARM AS THE CHAIR SAID UGH CHAIRMAN SAID WE HAVE HAD FIVE HEARINGS INCLUDING ONE THAT WAS JOHN AB PLUS ONE THAT WAS JUST ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE SINCE JANUARY. WE'VE HEARD WRITTEN TESTIMONY IN REPORTS BOTH ONLINE AND IN PERSON. WE CONDUCTED EXTREMELY VALUABLE WORKPLACE CLIMATE SURVEY THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO ABOUT -- A WE HAVE FOLLOWED UP WITH MANY HEARINGS -- AND BICAMERAL AND BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP I AND WE HELD A HEARING ON THE DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS JUST LAST WEEK. SO IT'S BEEN A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS WITH A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS A LEADING UP TO THIS DAY. I'M A WITHOUT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO VICE CHAIR HOLY MITCHELL FOR ANY OPENING REMARKS AND TO TALK TO US ABOUT THE CLIMATE SURVEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR I COLLEAGUES -- THIS MORNING ON KQED AS OUR DRIVE INTO THAT CAPPED Y. CAUGHT THE TAIL END OF IT INTERESTING REPORT -- REPORT. THE INTERVIEW WAS -- BEING CONDUCTED WITH THE PRESIDENT OF MALES COLLEGE AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT A SEXUAL HARASSMENT REPORT THAT THEY'VE COMPLETED ON CAMPUS IN THE AND IF YOU ARE WAS SUGGESTING THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE REPORT WAS IT VERY POSITIVE. THE DID APPEAR AS IF THEY'VE MADE MUCH PROGRESS IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO A DEAL WITH THE ISSUE. AND SHE MADE THE STATEMENT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS QUITE PROFOUND AND CERTAINLY APPLIES TO US. AND HER COMMENT WAS THAT THE CLIMATE IN THE WORKPLACE. IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE WORK THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED THERE. AND SO IN THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE CHAIR ALL OF THE PROPHECIES% WE'VE ALL GONE THROUGH OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR SALTERTON REMEMBER IS THIS IS AN H. OUR POLICY. THAT WILL GOVERN. HOW WE AS EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER [inaudible] TO THAT. POINT WE ENGAGED ARE IN A CLIMATE SURVEY I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME FIND. REMEMBER CORRECTLY FROM -- ASSEMBLY AND SENATE RULES PROVIDING INFORMATION PROVIDING INFORMATION THE FIRST TIME THE LEGISLATURE'S CONDUCTED AN OFFICIAL CLIMATE SURVEY WE ARE ASKING. EMPLOYEES BOTH THE DISTRICT OFFICES COMMITTEE OFFICES CAPITOL OFFICES AS WELL AS VOLUNTEERS AND INTERNS. TO TALK TO US ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE AS AN EMPLOYEE WORKING FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WE ENGAGE SEE ARE A FIRM THAT HAS -- EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING CLIMATE SURVEYS AND WE JUMPED WE LAUNCH THIS PROCESS. LEGISLATURE OR WERE ALSO INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. THIS IS A HIGH LEVEL FOUR FIVE FLY -- SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS MOST OF WHICH I HAVE TO TELL YOU AND YOUR FELLOW COLLEAGUE WERE REALLY GOOD NEWS. THE INFORMATION IS BEING ROLLED OUT TO YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF AND WE ARE HOPING THAT YOUR SHE THE STAFF WILL TALK ABOUT. THE RESULTS WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IT REALLY IS THEIR DATA AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY SEE WHERE THEY FIT IN IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL CLIMATE. OF THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE. SO THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS YOU'LL SEE WAS TWENTY SIX HUNDRED ROUGHLY WE LEARNED FROM THE VENDOR THAT FOR PARTICULAR FOR A FIRST TIME SURVEY OF THE SKYLINE. OUR EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE ANYWHERE FROMBY THE THIRTY SIXTH OF 49% RETURN RATE. AND YOU SEE -- THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE FELL RIGHT IN WHERE WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FALL. NEXT LIVE. THE NEXT TWO SLIDES ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEY IDENTIFIED AS OUR REAL ORGANIZATIONAL STRENGTH YOU KNOW WE ARE TO SUBMIT THE SURVEY ITSELF TO TAKE ABOUT TEN MINUTES -- MISTER COOLEY WAS FRIEDMAN AND I WERE INVOLVED ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY THE SENATE RULES STAFF IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH THE VENDOR TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE QUESTIONS WERE HUMANE TO OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE VENDOR HAD WORKED WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES PREVIOUSLY BUT NEVER LEGISLATURE SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE -- CHANGE AND ALTER TO NEW WANTS TO MAKE IT RELEVANT WE DON'T CELEBRATE ACT HERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE QUESTIONS WERE. TO SO EMPLOYEES WOULD NOW THAT IT. AND SOME OF THE REALLY GOOD NEWS AS YOU'LL SEE EMPLOYEES ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK DUTIES THAT ARE COMMITTED TO THEIR WORK IN PUBLIC SERVICE 70% ARE SATISFIED. JOB DUTIES DECIDED AS THE NUMBER ONE REASON EMPLOYEES ARE STAYING INTENT TO REMAIN EMPLOYED BUT THE LEGISLATURE. AND EMPLOYEES WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR HEALTH PLANS AND BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE IS COMMITTED TO DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC NEXT SLIDE. THIS FOR ME I THINK I AS A FORMER STAFF. ALBEIT DECADES AGO AS WELL AS A MEMBER AND AS AN EMPLOYER. ARE THESE RESULT RESULTS I THINK WITH THE MOST -- AYE OPENING AND REWARDING RESULTS INDICATE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH COWORKERS AND LEADERS 83% OF EMPLOYEES ARE ENGAGED BY THEIR CO WORKERS. 70% OF EMPLOYEES ARE ENGAGED BY THE DIRECT IMMEDIATE STEPS SUPERVISOR AND OVER 80% OF EMPLOYEES BELIEVE THEIR SUPERVISOR IS TRUSTWORTHY CARING AND LISTENS TO THEIR IDEAS. I THINK THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT AND ALSO IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION WE WERE CLEAR -- THAT IT WAS THE ON YOUR MOST DIRECT SUPERVISOR. SO THAT WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF RESPONDING THEY'RE RESPONDING WITH REGARD TO THE LEGISLATOR IF IT WAS A LET JAY. THEY WERE RESPONDING THEY THAT WE DEFINE TO THEIR SUPERVISOR WAS BASED ON THEIR SPECIFIC POSITION SO ON LEGISLATOR SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT ALL OF THOSE COMMENTS WHERE -- TRICK THAT IT US WHAT WAS ON POWERFUL ABOUT THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO CHANGE CULTURE IS RECOGNIZING. HOW FOLKS FEEL ABOUT THEIR COWORKERS THEY SPEND MORE TIME WITH EACH OTHER THAN THEY DO WITH US? AS WELL AS PERSON THAT THEY HAVE TO RELY ON TO GET. INSTITUTIONAL INFORMATION AND WHO THEY REPORT CONCERNS IN THE WORKPLACE TO WHICH IS THEIR SUPERVISOR AND THAT'S THE PERSON THAT THEY FEEL LISTENS TO THEM THAT THEY FEEL LESS TRUSTWORTHY IN CARES ABOUT THEM. SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TAKING A TEMPERATURE CHECK OF THE CULTURE OF THE INSTITUTION RECOGNIZING THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR DIRECT SUPERVISOR. IS A REAL STRENGTH NEXT SLIDE. WE NOW MOVE INTO ORGANIZATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH REGARD TO THE STRENGTH WE ASK THE VENDOR TO GIVE US A SENSE OF KIND OF WHERE WE FAIL ON THE SPECTRUM OF YOU KNOW 70% THAT WOULD BE A CITY IS THAT GOOD OR NOT -- AND SO THEY GAVE US IN THE FULL REPORT WHICH YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO KIND OF WHERE WE FAIL IN TERMS OF OUR RATING. AND COMPARED TO OTHER GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND AGAIN IN THE AREAS OF OUR STRENGTH WE READ THE HIGH PERFORMING IN. NOW WITH REGARD TO ORGANIZATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES CLEARLY BASED ON THE NUMBERS YOU SEE THESE ARE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE TO FOCUS AND TARGET OUR EFFORTS SO WE CAN SEE SOME IMPROVEMENT. EMPLOYEES DO NOT FEEL SECURE IN THEIR JOBS AND DO NOT FEEL RESPECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE DAY. THAT WAS THE OVERALL QUESTION INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS OF POWER SUPPORT AND HARASSMENT FREE WORK ENVIRONMENT. 38% DO NOT BELIEVE VICTIMS OR REPORTERS OF HARASSMENT ARE FREE FROM RETALIATION. 33% DO NOT BELIEVE APPROPRIATE ACTUAL BE TAKEN AFTER A COMPLAINT IS MADE. WHAT WAS STRIKING ABOUT THE STATISTICS ONLY LOOKED AT THE OVERALL REPORT IS? I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT PERCENTAGE BUT IT WAS A RELATIVELY HIGH. PERCENT THAT SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD OUR POLICY. SO UNDERSTANDING THE POLICY AND YET HAVING FEELINGS THAT A COMPLAINT MORE BE MADE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN. AND EMPLOYEES WILL BE FREE FROM RETALIATION REALLY HELPED US KIND OF LASER FOCUSING IN ON WHAT OUR CORE. PROBLEM IS IN TERMS OF OUR CULTURE AND EMPLOYEES FEELING HURT AND HAVE IN THE PAST -- TOWARDS HAVING WORKPLACE CHALLENGES RESOLVE IN A HEALTHY APPROPRIATE WAY. NEXT LIVE. TWO OF THOSE WHO WHO INDICATE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE OUR WITNESS HARASSMENT HEY FEMALES REPORTED HIGHER INCIDENTS OF HARASSMENT THAN MEN. BE THE PERCENTAGE OF SUPERVISORS REPORT HARASSMENT IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF NON SUPERVISORS HOWEVER THE NUMBER OF NON SUPERVISORS REPORTING HARASSMENT IS GREATER THAN THAT OF SUPERVISORS SEE. THE MOST PREVALENT IN THE CASE OF HARASSMENT RESULTED FROM LOBBYISTS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. CAPITAL EMPLOYEES REPORTED HIGHER INCIDENCE OF THAN THOSE LOCATED IN THE DISTRICT. YOU KNOW SEE WAS -- PAINFUL. CLEAR INFORMATION FOR US ALL TO RECEIVE I THINK -- AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THE CASES INVOLVING ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT LET US DOWN THIS PATH TO REVAMP IN DEVELOPING THESE NEW SYSTEMS I THINK OUR ASSUMPTIONS WORD THAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT QUESTION WOULD BE DIFFERENT. AND SO NOW THAT WE'RE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY TO DEAL WITH DEVELOPING AN INTERNAL PROCESS THAT GOVERNS US AS LEGISLATORS AND STAFF THE STAFF. BUT ALSO HOW WE MANAGE -- STAFF EXPERIENCES WITH THE EXTERNAL COMMUNITY THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- ALSO THOSE WHO ENGAGE AS KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR WORKPLACE ON A REGULAR BASIS [inaudible] NEXT SLIDE. AND SO THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH A BASED ON THEIR EXPERTISE IN DOING CLIMATE SURVEYS. ARE ENGAGING WITH ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING AND CHANGING THEIR WORKPLACE CULTURE THESE ARE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY AFFORDED US NUMBER. ONE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ASSESSMENT. AND AND THE FOCUS IS REVIEW RESET EVALUATE AND ENFORCED REVIEW MEANS TO ASSESS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND THEIR LOVE AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE CURRENT CLIMATE. ARE THE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE CULTURE ARE THEY CLEARLY DEFINED WE HEARD WITNESS AFTER WITNESS TALK ABOUT. KIND OF THE DID RESEARCH BASED EXPERIENCE BASE NEW APPROACH TO TRAINING AND THAT IS NOT A ONE SHOT DEAL EVERY TWO YEARS BUT AS WE KNOW IN TERMS OF OUR OWN LIVES IN TERMS OF BEAT TRUE BEHAVIOR CHANGE. IT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT KIND OF TRAINING SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT BYSTANDER TRAINING MORE FREQUENT TRAINING TRAINING THAT IS DESIGNED WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN MIND AND SO IT'S NOT A GENERIC -- AT JANE AND JOE ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION AT THE WATERCOOLER BUT REAL EXPERIENCES -- IF YOU ARE A LEAD J.. OR IF YOU ARE A FIELD DEPTH IN A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC A CONSTITUENT COMES IN THE OFFICE AND DOES INAPPROPRIATE THINGS GO OUT HOW DO YOU MANAGE THOSE. SO WE'RE CLEAR THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO REVIEW OUR POLICIES AND OUR PRACTICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY REFLECT. CURRENT BEST PRACTICE IN THE FIELD OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. RESET EDUCATE EMPLOYEES ON APPROPRIATE AVENUES TO LOCK COMPLAINTS BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE COMPLAINT IS MADE. I THINK THE RESET IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON TODAY IN TERMS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO BRINGING FORWARD TO JOINT RULES COMMITTEE A FRAMEWORK FOR A NEW SYSTEM. EVALUATE FREAK WILL EVALUATE THE USAGE UNDERSTANDING THIS EXECUTION OF THE POLICY PROCEDURE ASSESS. AND LAST IN FORCE BALANCE CONFIDENT YET CONFIDENTIALITY PROCESS WITH TRANSPARENCY IN INVESTIGATION AND FOLLOW UP. WITH THE PERSON MAKING THE REPORT. REALLY ALL OF THESE BUT TO BE THOSE LAST TWO ARE INCLUDED IN THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD AS THE CHAIRWOMAN SAID THIS IS A FRAMEWORK. ON THIS IS IN A POLICY THAT WILL REMAIN STATIC ON IS A POLICY THAT WE KNOW -- AS WE'RE DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK THE OF SILLY RULES COMMITTEES -- AND THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO PUT MEAT ON THOSE BONES AND WILL GO FORWARD IN DEVELOPING AND STRENGTHENING. OUR CORPORATE CULTURE AS AN ORGANIZATION TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL EMPLOYEES. I'VE GOT ONE MORE SLIDE I BELIEVE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS. LEVERAGING COWORKER ENGAGEMENT YOU REMEMBER THE SLIDE THAT SAID OVER 70% OF EMPLOYEES -- ON FELT THAT THEY WERE ENGAGED WITH THEIR CO WORKERS TO EDUCATE ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND HOW TO CREATE A FAIR INCLUSIVE CLIMATE. UNDERSTAND MORE EMPLOYEES REPORT WITH THE SENIOR RASPUTIN EMPLOYEES REPORTED EXPERIENCING HARASSMENT. EDUCATE TRAIN EMPLOYEES AND HOT ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUSLY REPORT INCIDENTS THE OF WITNESS AND ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO MAKE REPORTS. THE LAST SECTION IS ON TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. TRANSPARENCY MODEL AND EVALUATE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE STEPS INVOLVED IN THE PROPHECIES INCLUDING WHO WILL BE COUNTY COMPLAINTS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE FEAR OF RETALIATION. TO HOLD LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES AND CREATE A FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE AND TO MAKE THAT A PRIORITY. AND LASTLY AGAINST EVALUATE WE WILL REASSESS THESE METRIC FOR THE FOLLOW UP SURVEY TO GAUGE PROGRESS. ON THE INDUSTRY STANDARD -- IS TO HAVE A BASELINE WHICH THIS CLIMATE SURVEY ENDS AND TO THEN CONDUCT ADDITIONAL SURVEYS USING THE SAME QUESTION SO YOU HAVE APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON. IN MONTHS OR YEARS TO FOLLOW WE'RE CLEAR BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE CAN BE A BUREAUCRATIC. ORGANIZATION THAT SOMETIME IT TAKES TIME TO PUT CHANGE IN MOTION AND SO -- WE'RE CLEAR THAT I THINK WE'VE AGREED TO PERHAPS SIX MONTHS. AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR IS IN PLACE THAT WILL GO BACK AND HAVE ANOTHER CLIMATE SURVEY SOUL EMPLOYEES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE FEEL AND EXPERIENCE A SHIFT IN OUR CULTURE. AND THEREBY -- GREATEST ACCORDINGLY. ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OF ME BEFORE WE MOVE ON WITH THE REST OF THE PRESENTATION. AGAIN THIS IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY -- AND THEY'RE ADDITIONAL SLIDES AVAILABLE ON THAT AGREEMENT MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU CHIEF OF STAFF THAT YOU CAN ACCESS -- FOR MORE. DETAILS ON THE DATA. THE CUTEST MODEL SURE THANK YOU [inaudible] SHARES -- THE ONCE LIKE YOU HAD ABOUT THE NUMBER OF THE LOBBYISTS AND THE OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS. YEAH I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS. IF IF IT DOES A LOBBYIST AFTER REGISTER. TO COME INTO THIS BUILDING IS OUR A REQUIREMENT. HAVING SPENT SOME TIME IN A PREVIOUS LIFE AS A REGISTERED LOBBYIST TO TO YOU DO HAVE TO REGISTER WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. TO BE CONSIDERED A LOBBYIST TO ENTER THE BUILDING NIGHT I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT INTO THE BUILDINGS I DON'T THINK THAT'S A PART OF THE REQUIREMENT TO REGISTER. BUT YOU DO HAVE TO REGISTER AND THE PRIDE THAT REGISTRATION INCLUDES YOU KNOWDOCUMENT YOU LEFT FILE ON TERMS OF GIFTS YOU KNOW ALL THAT PROCESS BUT YOU HAVE. TO SIT THROUGH THE REGISTERED LOBBYISTS THAT IS A TERM THAT YES YOU DO REGISTER SO. COULD THIS POLICY. OUR LEASE WE CAN LOOK AT THE POLICY IF IF YOU HAVE BEEN. SO THAT IF SOMEONE HAS REPORTED THAT YOU HAVE [inaudible] USED THEM. THEN COULD THAT BE A FACTOR IN WHETHER OR NOT WE REGISTER. SO THAT THE ACTUAL QUESTION THAT WAS POSED ON THE SURVEY IT WAS ONE QUESTION AS I RECALL REGISTERED LOBBYISTS MEMBER THE PUBLIC AND SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE CLEAR. THAT IT'S A BROAD CATEGORY NOT JUST REGISTERED LOBBYISTS BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC YOU KNOW DISTRICT OFFICE STAFFS -- ON PARTICIPATED NAM IN THE SURVEY AS WELL AND SO WE DON'T KNOW -- OF ALL THE CASES WHICH FALL UNDER THE REGISTERED LOBBYISTS CATEGORY VERSES MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC -- YOU'LL HEAR -- AS THE CHAIR WOMAN WALKS US THROUGH ALL THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE'RE PROPOSING ON AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT DATA POINT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK AND DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK TO FIGURE OUT LEGALLY WHAT WE CAN. DO PALM BUT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY THE CLIMATE SURVEY SURFACED FACT AND IT'S NOW ON EVERYBODY'S RADAR SCREEN AND IT WILL CLEARLY BE A PART. OF OF OUR NEW REFORM PROCESS. CAN DO LEGALLY WE HAVEN'T IRONED OUT YET BUT I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ADD TO OUR PARKING LOT AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT SPECIFIC ANSWER FOR YOU TODAY. SENATE MITCHELL THANK YOU BOTH FOR TO GREAT JOB. IF I MAY JUMP IN ON THAT I THINK THAT PUTS A SPOTLIGHT ON APPOINT THE CHAIR FRIEDMAN [inaudible] HAS STRESSED. THAT WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS BROUGHT TO US TODAY. AND REFLECT OUTSTANDING EFFORT BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE. BUT I DO THINK OVER THE COURSE OF TIME AS WE AS WE IMPLEMENT THAT. THEY WILL BE SEVEN TWO REFINEMENT. THAT -- I I JUST DON'T TICKETS WERE BEING HONEST WITH OURSELVES IF WE ACT TODAY'S IF WE COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL UNFOLD. THIS BY THE WAY TRACKS WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN LA COUNTY WHERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS CAME FROM. THERE POLICY WENT TO AT LEAST THREE ITERATIONS OVER TIME. AND IT ALSO IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR CURRENT HOUSE RULE ON OUR HOUSE. SUBCOMMITTEE ON HARASSMENT. WHICH CONTEMPLATES THAT WE HAVE A POLICY BUT WILL BE SEPARATE REVISIONIST SUBSEQUENT EVENTS REQUIRE. SO I JUST THINK YOUR POINT IS A GOOD. ONE BUT EXACTLY HOW IT APPLIES IN THE GIVEN FACT PATTERNS SINCE. MANY PEOPLE ENTER THE BUILDING EXERCISING THEIR FIRST MATTER RIGHT TO SPEECH. SOME HAVE A FORMAL BUSINESS ROLE HERE IS RICHARD LOBBYIST. BUT ULTIMATELY WE ARE CONCERNED WITH IN GENERAL ENVIRONMENT THAT IS FAIR AND SAFE AND PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S. ALLOWABLE I JUST DO THINK THERE WILL BE A LEARNING CURVE A TO CONTINUE THE WORK. THAT WHAT A HEAVY LIFT OF LEARNING OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES ENGAGED IN. SO IT'S AN ONGOING WORK A TO BE SURE. A LOT WITH THAT [inaudible] MS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU -- HAD THANK YOU -- SENATOR MITCHELL I'M NOT GOING TO BE REDUNDANT TRY NOT TO BE REDONE WITH ANYTHING THAT SHE PRESENTED TO YOU -- I'M GOING TO OUTLINE -- THE FRAMEWORK FOR THIS POLICY OF COURSE YOU ALL HAVE WRITTEN DOCUMENTS THAT THAT GIVE A LOT MORE DETAIL SO THIS WILL BE A MORE HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSION -- FIRST OF ALL EVERY CHANGE THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING TO EVERY ASPECT OF THIS POLICY IS WITH WITH THE GOAL OF CULTURE CHANGE IN THE INSTITUTION. AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- WRITTEN POLICY IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT THAT REAL CULTURAL BRIAN AND CULTURE CHANGE AND SO THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THIS POLICY IS REALLY INTENDING TO DO. AT THE END OF THE DAY -- AND THAT CULTURE CHANGE IS -- ONE TWO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF RESPECTABILITY AND DIVERSITY WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE -- THE BEGINNING OF ALL OF THAT OF COURSE IS A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE KIND OF TRAINING PROGRAM AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED. TRAINING THAT'S MORE RELEVANT TO OUR PARTICULAR WORKPLACE WITH MORE EXPLANATIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE GRAY AREAS THAT THAT WE HAVE BETWEEN OUR WORK QUOTE UNQUOTE WORK ENVIRONMENT HERE IN THE BUILDING BUT THEN. THE OFTEN BEING OUT IN THE FIELD. STILL ENCOUNTERING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN YOUR OFFICIAL CAPACITY AND STAFFERS AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S STILL AN EXTENSION OF YOUR WORKPLACE IN OUR POLICY STILL APPLY. IN BRINGING IN -- TRAINING THAT HAS MORE -- QUANTITATIVE DATA OF EFFICACY A RETRAINING LIKE BYSTANDER TRAINING AN IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING AND AND I INTERACTIVE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE OUT THERE TO HAVE A MUCH MORE ENGAGING AND ONGOING. TRAINING FOR UP FOR EVERYBODY WHO WORKS IN THIS BUILDING. OUR CODE IS ASPIRATIONAL IT'S MUCH BROADER THAN WHAT WE'VE HAD BEFORE IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF BEHAVIOR THAT IT COVERS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A SEA CHANGE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WE ARE NO LONGER GOING TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING TO RISE TO THE LEVEL OF LEGALLY ACTIONABLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO TAKE ACTION. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE ONE ELEMENT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS PERVASIVENESS SO IF WE CAN COME IN EARLY. THE VERY FIRST TIME AN INCIDENT OCCURS ONE JOKE ONE INAPPROPRIATE PHYSICAL CONDUCT. BOB ONE INAPPROPRIATE IMAGE BEING SHARED ON A COMPUTER. WE CAN THEN OFFER TRAINING AND COUNSELING AND CORRECT THAT BEHAVIOR BEFORE WE DO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A STAFFER FEELS THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN UP HOSTILE WORKPLACE. FOR MONTHS ON END FEELS THAT THEY HAVE O COME FOR WITH A VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATION TO DO THAT IT MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING OUR STAFF AND EACH OTHER. TO REPORT ON THOSE SORTS OF INCIDENCES -- AND IN A MUCH EARLIER IN MUCH DIFFERENT WAY. AND AGAIN THE GOAL IS TOWARDS CORRECT CREEK CORRECTIVE BEHAVIOR NOT PUNITIVE ACTION SO THAT WE CAN GIVE THAT EMPLOYEE OR EACH OTHER THE CHANCE TO COURSE CORRECT -- WE THINK THAT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE'VE SEEN AND FOR INSTANCE WAS REFERENCE LA COUNTY WHICH HAS A SIMILAR KIND OF CODE OF CONDUCT. THAT THAT BEGINS THEN THE DISK BUT THAT THE ACTUAL CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES THINKING. IS THIS ACTION GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S REPORTABLE RATHER THAN SAYING WELL I CAN HAVE X. AMOUNT OF INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT BEFORE IT IT CROSSES THE LINE YOU WANT TO GET IN EARLY AND STOP THAT BEHAVIOR -- THAT CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THIS PART OF THIS PROCESS IS BASED ON PROTECTED CLASS. SO AGE GENDER DISABILITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION RACE. BASED ON THAT PROTECTED CLASS WILL MOVE IT INTO THE REALM OF THIS POLICY RATHER THAN A TYPICAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRACK WHICH OTHER TYPES OF WORKPLACE INCIDENTS WILL STILL CONTINUE TO BE REFERRED. AND AGAIN ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS REINFORCED CHANGE SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT. OF THE BEGINNING OF THAT IS TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT UNIT. WHICH WILL BE HOUSE UNDER LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL BUT WILL BE INDEPENDENT AND SIGH LOAD SO THAT I CAN WORK WITHOUT. WITHOUT SORT OF HAVING THE OVERSIGHT OF THIS OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. WHO BOMBED AND THE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT BRINGS SO? THAT INDEPENDENT LEGISLATIVE WORKPLACE. YOU TO CUT OUR CONDUCT UNIT. WILL BE BI CAMERAL WHICH IS AGAIN A SEA CHANGE FOR HOW WE OPERATE. IT WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF OTHER. IT SEE IT IS SEEN AS BEING UNBIASED AND FAIR TO EVERYBODY WHO. GOES WELL I'M IN FRONT OF IT. IT WILL HAVE TRAIN SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES IT WILL BE IN PLACE TO ADVISE SUPERVISORS AND STOP ON WORKPLACE CONDUCT. ITS DUTIES WILL BE TO TAKE REPORTS TO DO AND IN THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION AND ASSESSMENT. AND ALSO INVESTIGATIONS AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE EXPERTS WHO TALKED TO US ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS WASTE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS IS YOU MUST AS AN EMPLOYER BE ABLE TO GET TO THE PLACE FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CONDUCT FAIR INVESTIGATIONS. WHICH MEANS DOING THOSE IN HOUSE HOWEVER IF THE INVESTIGATORS ARE BEING ASKED TO DO INVESTIGATIONS ON THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THEM ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHART LIKE MEMBERS. THAT'S WHERE YOU WOULD PROBABLY SEND THAT OUT FOR EXTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS SO THERE'S SORT OF A CLEAR YOU KNOW DEMARCATION LINE AS TO WHAT YOU DO INTERNALLY AND WHAT YOU DO EXTERNALLY BUT YOU MUST GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THE MAJORITY OF YOUR STAFF YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR ORDINARY. INVESTIGATIONS INTERNALLY. AND THERE WILL BE TIMES WHERE YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THOSE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE THE PARTIES WILL ALL AGREE ON WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT THE INCIDENT WAS [inaudible] AS WELL -- THAT UNIT WILL BE AS AGAIN INDEPENDENT FROM EITHER HOUSE. IT WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION SO EVERY INCIDENT THAT COMES IN WILL BE TRIAGE TO SEE IF IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN. OR WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD GO OUT FOR INVESTIGATION AT WHAT LEVEL SO IMMEDIATE TRIAGE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IT WILL ACCEPT ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS IT WILL ACCEPT COMPLAINTS FROM EXTERNAL PEOPLE SO ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO WALKS AND WHO HAS AN INCIDENT WITH ONE OF OUR STAFFERS OR LEGISLATOR. WOULD BE ABLE TO GO IN FRONT OF THAT TO BRING THAT TO THE PANEL. IT WILL ALSO HAVE SOME SORT OF INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BECAUSE WE OWE OUR EMPLOYEES THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT IF THEY HAVE HER* MEANT THAT SERIOUS COMING FROM. A LOT A LOBBYIST A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT THAT EMPLOYEE. AS SENATOR MITCHELL INDICATED THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN DO WHAT OUR RESPONSE CAN BE BUT WE STILL HAVE. TO TO INVESTIGATE THAT INCIDENT AND MAKE A DETERMINATION AND FIND A WAY TO PROTECT AN EMPLOYEE IF THERE REALLY AND THAT KIND OF A SITUATION SO THAT WILL BE DONE AND THAT'S PART OF THE POLICY THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE. DEVELOPED OVER TIME -- CERTAINLY. THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE TIMELY EVIDENCE WILL BE COLLECTED THOSE WHO MAKE THAT -- REPORT WILL BE KEPT -- INFORMED AS TO THE PROGRESS AND YOU KNOW AS TO YOU KNOW SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS BEING DONE AND TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AND WILL READ WE WILL RETAIN WE'VE WHICH WE RECENTLY BROUGHT AND FOR EMPLOYEE COUNSELING WE DOES NOT DO INVESTIGATIONS THEY DO NOT OFFER LEGAL ADVICE BUT THEY DO OFFER A LOT OF PORT AND GIVING OF INFORMATION TO EMPLOYEES SO THAT THEY CAN GO SOMEWHERE THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE REALM. OF YOU KNOW OUR FORMAL PROCESS TO GET INFORMATION AND WE'VE OF COURSE WILL. BE -- GIVEN THE FULL POLICIES SO THEY UNDERSTAND THE POLICY AND CAN GIVE COUNSELING TO EMPLOYEES BASED ON OUR POLICY AS WELL AS THE LAW. WITHIN THAT INDEPENDENT UNIT WE WILL BE CREATING AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF AN INDEPENDENT. THOUGHT OUTSIDE PANEL WHICH IS AGAIN VERY NEW TO THE LEGISLATURE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS BEING DONE ANY LEGISLATURE STATE HOUSE AROUND THE COUNTRY. THIS PANEL WILL CONSIST OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS PEOPLE WITH DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD THE TYPICAL TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE ON THE PANEL WILL BE EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS WHO HAVE WORKED BOTH ON THE EMPLOYEE SIDE AND ON THE EMPLOYER SIDE. RETIRED JUDGES WHO HAVE BEEN A HEARING THESE CASES FOR MANY YEARS PEOPLE THAT WE ALL WOULD AGREE. ARE -- REALLY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THIS AREA. THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PANEL WILL BE OVERSIGHT OF THE INDEPENDENT UNITS ASSESSMENTS. TO REVIEW THE EVIDENCE COLLECTED BY INVESTIGATORS TO DETERMINE ON THE FACTUAL FINDINGS OF IN THE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE INCIDENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WAS INDEED A VIOLATION OF OUR POLICIES. AND IF SO AT WHAT KIND OF WHAT LEVEL OF VIOLATION. TO BRIEF THE RELEVANT HOUSE IN THE SUPERVISOR AND THEN TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THERE ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. SHOULD BE A TYPE OF DISCIPLINE TYPES OF TRAINING THOSE KINDS OF RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THEIR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. EACH HOUSE WILL RETAIN THE FINAL DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY. IN THOSE CASES THEY WILL DETERMINE HOW TO RESPOND TO THE PANELS. ALMOND THEY WILL -- IT DOCUMENT FINAL DECISIONS ON THE RESPONSE AND THAT WILL BE DOCUMENTED. THE HOUSE WILL ISSUE LETTERS FROM A A TO THE SUBJECT OF THE INQUIRY THE SUBJECT BEING THE PERSON YOU KNOW WHO MAY HAVE MADE THE INAPPROPRIATE. THEY'VE DONE THE INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT THEY WILL RECEIVE A SUMMARY OF THE PANEL FINDINGS AND THE TERMS THE TYPES OF RESPONSES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ANTICIPATE. AND THEN IN TERMS OF CONFIDENTIALITY I'M THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED FROM EVERY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT THAT'S BECAUSE THAT HAS COME IN BUT THAT ENCOURAGING ENCOURAGES REPORTING. PEOPLE WHO REPORT THESE -- ARE REPORTING THEM TO US BECAUSE THEY EXPECT BECAUSE THEY WANT A RESPONSE BUT THEY ALSO WANT CONFIDENTIALITY AS MUCH AS WE CAN GIVE IT -- AND THE PERSON WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF CONFIDENTIALITY BECAUSE THESE ARE INTERNAL WORKPLACE INCIDENTS. IF WE WANT. TO ASK OUR EMPLOYEES AND EACH OTHER TO FOR THE FIRST TIME REPORT. A VERY BROAD RANGE OF CONDUCT THINGS THAT FALL WAY BELOW ANY COULD OF LEGAL DEFINITION OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE REPORTS ARE CONFIDENTIAL. IF OUR INTENTION IS REALLY TO GET AN EARLY TO OFFER TRAINING AND COUNSELING THAT SHOULD BE DONE CONFIDENTIALITY BECAUSE IF NOT IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER. TO GET PEOPLE TO REPORT THOSE KINDS OF VIOLATIONS SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN FOR THOSE. EARLY TYPES OF ARMOR -- OF REPORTS THAT WE MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE MORE REPORTING HOWEVER WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT POLICY ON DISCLOSURE WHEN IT COMES TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND SENIOR STAFF THAT WHEN THERE'S A DETERMINATION THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN A SUSTAINED ALLEGATION OF SERIOUS SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE RELEASED AS IT IS NOW UNDER OUR POLICY -- WE WILL OF COURSE REDACT AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND THE IDENTITIES OF THE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES -- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE CAREFUL TO MAINTAIN THAT PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY WITH THE PUBLIC'S LEGAL AT OUR RIGHT TO KNOW AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO MEMBERS AND SENIOR STAFF. I'M WITH THAT I WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AND THAT'S THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF THE POLICY IT IS A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST. HAVING AN OUTSIDE GROUP MAKING THE DETERMINATIONS OF WHETHER THERE WAS A VIOLATION OF POLICY IS PRETTY RADICAL. HAVING ALSO THEY'RE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE FOLLOWED IN MOST INSTANCES IS ALSO A BIG CHANGE BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GIVE THE PERCEPTION OF FAIRNESS TO EVERYBODY. TO HAVE A POLICY THAT OPERATES THE SAME WHETHER IT'S A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE OR A STAFFER THEY WILL GO DOWN THE EXACT SAME TRAP WITH THE EXACT. SAME TYPE OF PROCESS -- A I THINK IT'S A FAIR POLICY AND HAVING THAT INDEPENDENT UNIT WITH OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS WHO ARE UNDER CONTRACT THE LEGISLATURE BUT NOT EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGISLATURE -- WITH EXPECTATIONS WITH WRITTEN RIGHT WITHIN THEIR CONTRACT OF THE TYPE OF UNBIASED AND FAIR DETERMINATIONS THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO MAKE. I THINK SHOULD GIVE EVERYBODY THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE SET UP A FRAMEWORK THAT'S INTENDED TO BE FAIR -- TO EVERYBODY WITH THE RIGHT BALANCE OF DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. I'M WITHOUT I WILL SEE IF MY VICE CHAIRS ANYTHING TO ADD BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION IN A CONDENSED PERIOD OF TIME IN THE MUGGLE QUESTIONS. WHAT IT WOULD? MADAM CHAIR YOU MENTION THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S A HUGE DEPARTURE AND SOMETHING NEW IN TERMS OF THE PANEL I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT AND THAT MEMBERS UNDERSTOOD THAT IT'S WE'VE LOOKED AT A EXISTING. ALL THE LA COUNTY. THE YEARS THEY'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE YES THANK YOU IN TERMS OF THE PANEL -- PART OF THIS THE IMPANELED MAKING THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S BEEN A A VIOLATION OF OUR POLICY AND THEN MAKING THE RECOMMEND RECOMMENDED RESPONSES. ON LA COUNTY INSTITUTED THIS MODEL MANY YEARS AGO HAVING TO DO WITH A CULTURE PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAD IN THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY DIVISIONS. I AND THEN IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IN PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THEY ROLLED OUT ACROSS THEIR ENTIRE WORKFORCE WHICH IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES STRONG. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT LA COUNTY IS THAT THEY HAVE A VERY DIVERSE WORKFORCE THEY HAVE. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS THAT MAY HAVE FIVE PEOPLE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY DIVISIONS THAT ARE OUT IN A RURAL PART OF LA COUNTY WITH JUST A COUPLE OF PEOPLE. AND THEN THEY HAVE HOSPITALS THAT MIGHT HAVE TEN PLEASE SO THEY HAVE FOUND THAT THIS PROCESS WORKS ALL ACROSS THOSE DIFFERENT VARIED WORK FORCES AND WE'VE GOT DISTRICT OFFICES THAT ARE SMALL OUT ON THE FIELD AND WE'VE GOT. YOU KNOW THE BUILDING HERE. THEY ALSO BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY BROAD POLICY THAT COVERS A VERY BROAD RANGE OF INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT AND THEY THEY ACTUALLY ASK ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WHETHER SUPERVISORS ARE NOT TO REPORT THOSE. THEY FIND THAT THEY'RE IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES HAS REALLY INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS AND IN FACT. I WENT DOWN TO WATCH THE PANEL AND I SAW A CASE WERE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE NOT EVEN YOU KNOW HIGH LEVEL SUPERVISORS NEW THE PROCESS SO MUCH THAT ONE INCIDENT OCCURRED. THE IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN EACH ROAD UP A NEW GUY A SORT OF AN AFFIDAVIT OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED SO THAT LATER ON THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYONE. RE REMEMBERING WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS AND THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF CULTURE CHANGE BECAUSE WHEN YOUR EMPLOYEES START TO INTERNALIZE THIS. AND START THINKING TO THEMSELVES WITHOUT A VIOLATION OF CONDUCT MAYBE I SHOULD INTERVENE MAYBE I NEED TO TALK TO THAT PERSON MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN AND WRITE. RIGHT THIS INCIDENT UP AND SEE IF IT'S A VIOLATION THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY BIG BEGIN TO HAVE THAT CULTURE CHANGE SO THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS -- DOING THIS OVER THE PAST I THINK IT'S FIFTEEN YEARS AND WE WERE VERY IMPRESSED NO OF COURSE THE POLICY HAS BEEN TAILORED TO OUR WORKPLACE BECAUSE WE ARE DIFFERENT WERE VERY TOP HEAVY. WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE IS THEY HAVE FIVE SUPERVISORS IN JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER ELECTED IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT A BIT. BUT THAT BASIC TENANT OF AN INDEPENDENT PANEL BIT OF OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. TO INVESTIGATE AND ADJUDICATED WE THOUGHT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND FIT VERY WELL WITH WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT THE THE POLICY APPLIES TO THE ELECTED BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO THAT'SWHAT WE THOUGHT. ONLY LOOKED AT MODELS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT IT -- WAS GERMANE TO OUR EXPERIENCE WITH A PLACID EMPLOYEES. AS WELL AS THE ELECTED OFFICIALS CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I ALSO JUST WANT TO APPLAUD THE CO CHAIRS IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS. REALLY IMPORTANT HISTORIC WORK IN. NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH BUT LEARNING FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS PARTICULARLY LOS ANGELES [inaudible] IN. I'M LOOKING AT PAGE FIVE ON THE RECOMMENDED POLICY. AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITHOUT GETTING TOO MUCH IN THE WE'D SPENT. OF MOVING FORWARD OF EDUCATING STAFF THERE IS KIND OF A GRAY AREA OF THE ABILITY [inaudible] TO ASSURE. AND ACCUSER OR WITNESS OF CONFIDENTIALITY -- AND IN THE LANGUAGE REFLECTS THAT -- YOU DO HAVE A LEGISLATURE CANNOT GUARANTEE CONFIDENTIALITY BUT IT CAN MAKE AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY FOR THE LAW ALLOWS [inaudible] SO. IN THE TRAINING I THINK WE NEED TO BACK SOME OF THIS RECOMMENDED POLICY INTO TRAINING. REALIZING THERE STILL MAY BE A GRAY AREA THAT COULD STILL SERVICE A RESTRAINT. FOR EITHER A VICTIM OR A WITNESS TO FEEL FULLY COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD. AND I THINK THERE IS SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN. WHAT DOES GET RELEASED ULTIMATELY TO THE PUBLIC IF IT'S A HIGH RANKING STAFF MEMBER OR LEGISLATOR -- YOU CAN TRY TO ASSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY THE COMPLAINANT. THAT IF IF THE ACCUSED NAME BECOMES PUBLIC AS A MATTER OF TRANSPARENCY IN [inaudible] PUBLIC POLICY [inaudible] THAT ME [inaudible] UNINTENTIONALLY. REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF AT LEAST A GROUP OF EMPLOYEES SO I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THAT I THINK YOU FLAGGED. THE CHALLENGE ON THE ONE HAND WE WANNA. HAVE THAT TRANSPARENCY FOR CERTAIN LEVEL OF COMPLAINTS THAT. IT DOES GET SHARED WITH A COMMITMENT TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY. ON BUT IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY AND I THINK WHO IN THE TRAINING PEOPLE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE -- EVEN THOUGH WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY FOR IT SOUGHT. CIRCUMSTANCES AND OR THE LAW MAIN -- ALLOW US TO MAKE GOOD SO FOR SUPERVISORS FOR PEOPLE INTRODUCING THE POLICY IN IN TRAINING. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE CANDID WITH TRANSPARENT WHERE THERE ARE GRAY AREAS. BUT COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE SIR I THINK OUR SUBTITLE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS CAN ATTEST WE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME. TALKING ABOUT REALLY TERMINOLOGY AND AND HOW WE HAVE TO HAVE TO CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE WE HAVE COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF WORDS AND SO WE TALKED ABOUT. ANONYMOUS REPORTING AND CONFIDENTIALITY IN TRANSPARENCY. AND HOW -- WE FEEL A HIGHLY. GET THE NEW POLICY IN PLACE. AND AND OUR NUMBERS AROUND CONCERN AROUND RETALIATION DECREASE PEOPLE WILL HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE POLICY AND WILL BE WILLING TO KIND OF WORK WITHIN ITS CONFINES AS DEFINED BY LAW. SO WE AGREE WITH YOU WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S A VERY DELICATE AND ARE AND A PART OF THE CULTURE HE IF YOU KEEP HEARING THAT'S USED THE TERM. IS ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEW WANTS AND STRAIGHT FORWARD THANK YOU NEW DIGS THERE IS A NEXUS ALSO WITH. FEAR OF RETALIATION AND IF WE CAN BUILD CONFIDENCE AND THERE'S NO QUARTER FOR RETALIATION. IT MA'AM GOLDEN PEOPLE TO FEEL MORE CONFIDENT. EVEN IF IT SOME POINT IN THE PROCESS. THERE IDENTITY MY DID BECOME KNOWN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO JUST AT THAT TIME. THE INTENTION RITE NOW IS THAT IF THERE'S A A COMPLAINT ABOUT RETALIATION BASED ON ONE OF THESE CLAIMS THAT THE SAME PANEL. WILL BE HEARING THAT AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE AND CAN. CAN HEAR ABOUT AND WE TAKE THAT VERY VERY SERIOUSLY AND I ALSO WANT TO ADD A BECAUSE IT DONE THE PRESSES TALKED ABOUT THIS A BIT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DISCLOSE IN WHAT WE'RE NOT TO THE PUBLIC. THAT LA COUNTY THEY DISCLOSE NOTHING [inaudible] NOTHING THEY DON'T DISCLOSE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IF THAT HAPPENS THEY DON'T DISCLOSE ANY OF A THEY CONSIDER AT ALL TO BE INTERNAL HR. MATTERS BECAUSE THEY WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL FREE TO COME FORWARD AND MAKE THESE I'M A REPORT THESE INCIDENCES. I NEVER A CLEAR THAT THAT'S THE REASON THAT THEY KEEP THIS INTERNAL WE ARE GOING BEYOND THAT WE FEEL THAT THE PUBLIC A WE ARE BELIEF HERE IS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT I'M INCIDENCES THAT ARE SERIOUS. WITH LEGISLATORS AND SENIOR STAFF -- BUT AGAIN IT IS A BALANCE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANNA HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON PEOPLE I'M REPORTING INCIDENTS. ASSUME REPUBLICAN LEADER TALLY IN A JUMPING ON THIS SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBER PARTICIPANTS LEASE TAUGHT US QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. OUT SO ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD DURING THE MANY MEETINGS THAT WE HAD WAS. ABOUT YOU KNOW EVEN AS US IS ELECTED'S. WHERE YOU HAVE AN ALLEGATION AND IT HITS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPER DURING ELECTION RIGHT SO THAT'S NOT FAIR EITHER SO I? WE WE WRANGLED AROUND AND TALKED ABOUT THIS AT LEAT. AND THE ONE THING THAT DUMB. WITH THIS POLICY IN PLACE THEY'LL EAT HERE IT IT WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY IT WILL TAKE SOMETIME I THINK -- BUT WHEN THERE'S CONFIDENCE IN THIS PROCESS WORKING WE CAN SAY HEY ALL OF THE REPORTS GO TO THE COMMITTEE. THEY'RE VETTED THEY ARE -- REVIEWED BY PROFESSIONALS AND THEN WHATEVER THAT OUTCOME IS IS THE OUTCOME. AND SO -- IF THERE'S AN ABILITY FOR SOMEBODY OR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME MITCHELL USE THAT POLITICALLY WE CAN THEN ALL POINT TOWARDS NO WE'RE NOT ACCEPTING THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A POLITICAL STATEMENT FOR NOW. UNTIL WE GET THE FACTS FROM -- THIS NONPARTISAN -- PROFESSIONAL COMMITTEE SARAH. THANK YOU AGAIN SO COMMITTEE DID PHENOMENAL WORK OF IS A FORMER STAFFER -- THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- AND MY QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF THE FOLKS IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICE. WHO INTERACT WITH CONCERN SO YOUR CONSTITUENTS SOMETIMES -- AND HAVING THEM VERY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE. A TO PROTECT THEMSELVES -- FROM SOME COMMUTERS COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE CONSTITUENTS AND SO FORTH THING THAT'S VERY KEY TO THIS AS WELL IN JUST OVER A HARASSMENT IN GENERAL. OTHERS BUT SEVERAL INCIDENTS WHERE YOU KNOW WE WE STAFFER TALK TO BE YOU KNOW COURTEOUS AND OPEN THE DOOR FOR FOLKS AND SOMETIMES UP JUNE DOESN'T TURN OUT VERY WELL -- SO THIS IS. PARAMOUNT TO ENSURING THAT THEY ALSO KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AS EMPLOYEES IN THE CAPITAL IN THE DISTRICT OFFICE. THE ONLY THING I WOULD ASK AND ADD IT TO SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT STAFF UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE PROTECTIONS ARE AND WHAT WE AS AN INSTITUTION. CAN DO TO PROTECT THEM WHETHER THAT'S THERE THERE SAFETY THROUGH OUR SERGEANTS ORDER REPRESENTATION BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF THAT. GRAY AREA WHILE YOU KNOW WE HEAR MEMBERS ARE PROTECTED BUT STAFF ARE AND SO FORTH AND SO THAT KINDA LEADS TO SOME. KIND OF ANIMOSITY AS WELL FOR PEOPLE WANTING TO BE ABLE -- TO RABAA FRONT AND OPEN ABOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR STAFF MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO THAT ALSO. AFFECTS PEOPLE WANTING TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS JUST SOME THOUGHTS ON ON THAT. YEAH CLOSER ON THE REALLY IMPORTANT AFTER UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SO EXPERIENCES ARE NOT -- THEY DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE OR WERE YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE REALLY VISION EMOTIONALLY ABUSED OR HARASSED. YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THERE AS A STAFFER AND YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BE TELLING A SUPERVISOR ABOUT. SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT YOU I'M I DO WANT AND SO THAT SHOULD BE PART OF OUR TRAINING ARE ABSOLUTELY. AND I I NEVER RECEIVED TRAINING LIKE THAT SO I DON'T KNOW IF IF STAFF IS REALLY GIVEN THAT KIND OF TRAINING SO I THINK FORMALIZING THAT'S IMPORTANT. I DO WANNA I'M SAY ONCE AGAIN THAT THIS PARTICULAR THIS POLICY THIS CONDUCT POLICY IS BASED ON PROTECTED CLASS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL HAVE TO WE WILL BE TRAINING OUR WORKFORCE IS THAT. IF YOU HAVE A DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT ISSUE SURROUNDING THOSE ONE OF THOSE PROTECTED CLASSES GENDER RACE THAT SORT OF THING YOU WOULD COME INTO THIS UNIT. UMP BUT IF IT'S NOT ABOUT PROTECTED CLASS IF YOU JUST HAVE. IF YOU'RE COMING IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE ON THE OUTSIDE ARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS YOU KNOW JUST REALLY BEING A JERK AND YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE. YOU MAY BE REFERRED BACK TO HUMAN RESOURCES OR SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THAT'S WHY THE TRIAGE IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND CERTAINLY THE INSTRUCTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT PEOPLE WON'T KNOW WHERE THE CORRECT PLACE TO BRING. RIGHT THERE INCIDENT TO SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THAT THANK YOU FOR WORK. IF IF I MIGHT MISTER CHAIR I WOULD ADD ON SENATOR LAR I THINK THE UNIQUENESS ABOUT -- THE PANEL RECOGNIZING THAT THE PANEL ON WILL AND WILL NOT HEAR. THE THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS FOR STAFF AND MEMBERS. I'M HOPEFUL AND BEGIN TO SEND A VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO STAFF. THAT THIS THE WE ARE TRYING -- TO DEVELOP AND BUILD A SYSTEM AND A CULTURE OF EQUITY -- WHERE -- THEY SHOULD FULLY EXPECT THAT THIS PANEL WOULD HERE. CASES INVOLVING MEMBERS TO AND SO IT'S NOT A SEPARATE BUT EQUAL KIND OF SCENARIO THE PANEL WILL HEAR AS RESPONSIBLE TO RESPOND FOR INVESTIGATIONS FOR EVERYBODY MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CO CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE -- BUT I'M SURE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE MOTION THAN THERE ARE IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS LATER IN THE ONE OF THE LAST THE SECTION FIVE OF OUR ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS -- BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS AND ASK FOR CLARIFICATION ON ONE THING -- YOU KNOWN WHEN THIS ALL STARTED WHEN? PEOPLE CAME FORWARD AND IT WAS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD AND THAT WAS SOMETHING WE RECOGNIZED FROM THE GET GO THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF EMOTION WE HAD TESTIMONY WE DON'T WITH ALL KINDS OF ISSUES IN OUR FIRST ARTS SUBCOMMITTEE THEN OUR BY CARAMEL COMMITTEE -- YOU KNOW THE VICTIMS. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE VICTIMS ARE REALLY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO -- THE FEAR YOU KNOW THE FEELINGS THAT THEY WEREN'T BEING LISTENED. TO THE FOLLOW UP. EVEN EXISTENCE ARM OR INCONSISTENT AT ALL BUT IT WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAD OUR QUE IF POLICIES POLICIES THAT DIDN'T INVOLVE WITH THE TIMES WHICH YOU KNOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE ONE EVERYTHING KIND OF BROKE LOOSE AND MEDIA ALL OVER THE COUNTRY -- BUT WE CAN SAY THAT. WE HAVE HEARD YOU WE'VE HEARD THE VICTIMS. I THINK OUR COMMITTEE. REALLY THAT WAS [inaudible] YOU KNOW. WHAT THE WHOLE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF IT -- WHILE NO POLICY IS PERFECT THE SELECT COMMITTEE WORK TO DEVELOP. A POLICY -- UNIQUE TO OUR ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS BEEN TOUGH TO DO WHERE VERY UNIQUE IN OUR WAY -- THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUES BROUGHT TO US WITH THE INTENT TO CREATE THAT SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT WORK ON THE CULTURE CHANGES THE INTENT -- TO HAVE A HAVE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE COME TO WORK AND THEY FEEL LISTEN TO RESPECTED VALUED SO THAT. ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS YOU HEAR ABOUT HOME SOMETIMES AS WELL WHY WASN'T IT A BILL THAT WENT TO THE GOVERNOR TO BE SIGNED. BUT CLEARLY YOU KNOW SENATOR MITCHELL POINTED OUT THIS IS A H. OUR POLICY. AND I JUST WANTED. TO MAYBE IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT IT WAS AN HR POLICY VERSUS A BILL BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE AN ARGUMENT OUT THERE. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISS WALDRON AND AND I THINK I WOULD I WOULD ADD TO YOUR COMMENT YES THAT WE NOT ONLY HEARD FROM VICTIMS [inaudible] BUT WE FRAMED AGENDAS AND ALL OF US TOGETHER SPENT THE TIME TO HEAR FROM SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. AND SO WE DIDN'T -- BRING OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL. LEGISLATIVE BRILLIANCE TO THE TABLE. WE SPENT HOURS HEARING FROM PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WORK EVERY DAY. FROM -- EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEYS FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM SHARM THE NATIONAL INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FOR HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONALS -- SO WE HEARD FROM VICTIMS AND WE HEARD FROM THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WORK EVERY DAY. THAT TOGETHER HELPED INFORM THE FRAMEWORK OF A POLICY THAT'S BEFORE YOU -- WE ARE AN EMPLOYER. AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP H. OUR POLICIES TO GOVERN OUR WORK AS EMPLOYERS THAT IMPACT EMPLOYEES. AND THE NATURE OF THE WORK WE DO IS LEGISLATIVE. BUT WE ARE EMPLOYERS AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US IT AND WE WE SHOULD AND CAN AS EMPLOYER STEP UP AND DEVELOP A POLICY TO GOVERN OUR HR PRACTICES -- WE SHOULDN'T GET IN THE PRACTICE OF LEGISLATING A EVERY ACTION WE HAVE TO TAKE AS EMPLOYERS WE DON'T LEGISLATE OUR BENEFIT PACKAGE WE DON'T LEGISLATE. ARE WHAT YOU EAT YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH OUR OUR BUDGET IS FINITE BUT WE DON'T LEGISLATE HR PRACTICES ACROSS THE BOARD. LEGISLATING APPROPRIATE IS THE WORK WE DO. AS EMPLOYERS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE A SAFE WORKPLACE TO TO DEVELOP POLICIES THAT GUIDE OUR OUR PRACTICES OF EMPLOYERS THIS IS NO DIFFERENT. IT'S IMPORTANT -- ARE NEW FOCUS ON REINVIGORATED IN REFOCUSING OUR CORPORATE CULTURE IS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S NOT ALL LEGISLATIVE LEAD. MANDATE IT IT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO AS EMPLOYERS THERE MAY BE AS WE DEVELOP THE FRAMEWORK -- POTENTIALLY I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE ACTIONS WE NEED TO TAKE LEGISLATIVELY -- TO OPERATIONALIZE THE POSSIBLY PUT IN PLACE BUT THIS IS AN H. OUR POLICY THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP -- AND IT HERE TOO AS EMPLOYERS. VERYGOOD OKAY -- MISTER MCGUIRE SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH A FILE AND SAY THANK YOU AND CHAIRMAN AND CULTURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ALONG WITH COMMITTEE AND OF COURSE. VERY CAPABLE STAFF A BRING FORTIES RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK THIS IS. A GIANT STEP FORWARD. NOT FOR THE LEGISLATURE -- IN ENSURING THAT THERE IS DUE PROCESS. AND CANDIDLY PROTECTING THE STAFF OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL. A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THIS MAY BE AN ITEM OUT LATER FOR DIANE BOYD VINE. ON SO WHEN WE HAD THESE INCIDENTS. BREAK A EARLIER THIS YEAR. US ATTORNEYS CONTACTED THE STAFF. WHO WERE OUTSIDE ATTORNEYS? REPRESENTING OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND THE STAFF. ONE NEED TO BE ABLE TO INTERVIEW THEM ON RECORD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I AS WE ALL KNOW A STAFF PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE NEW TO THIS BUILDING -- OUR CHALLENGED WITH THEIR FINANCES [inaudible] AND WHERE I WORKED PRIOR TO THIS THE COUNTY CINEMA. BECAUSE IT WAS A UNIONIZED I'M COUNTY. THAT THEY WERE. THAT BAD AT THEIR ELIGIBLE FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION AND NOT HAVING TO BE A GOING TO AN INTERVIEW OR DEPOSITION. WITHOUT LEGAL REPRESENTATION. ONE ITEM I WOULD SAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- BECAUSE THERE WILL BE OTHER. EVENTS LIKE WE SAW IN THE PAST. HOW WERE ABLE? TO ENSURE THAT STAFF HAS PROPER LEGAL REPRESENTATION. PRIOR TO GOING INTO A INTERVIEW FORMAL INTERVIEW WITH A UP POTENTIAL ALL USES. A WITH ALL DUE RESPECT HOSTILE ATTORNEY WHO IS REPRESENTING A CLIENT [inaudible] ON WHERE. I HARASSMENT MADE TAKEN PLACE. AND IT WAS THANKS TO OUR OUTSIDE COUNSEL SOME WONDERFUL WOMEN FROM THE THIRD HOUSE. WHO HELPED A SOME OF THE WOMEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT PROVIDED EVENTUALLY A LEGAL REPRESENTATION? I JUST BRING THAT FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS AN ITEM THAT WERE EVENTUALLY CAN HAVE TO TACKLE BECAUSE SPENDING FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR. FOR LEGISLATIVE AIDE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE LEGAL REPRESENTATION. IT'S GONNA BE A CHALLENGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AYE IN AGAIN. JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT NETWORK AT EACH. THROUGH EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EACH EMPLOYEE CURRENTLY RECEIVES ONE HOUR CONSULTATION BUT ON THAT IS CURRENTLY IT SO THAT'S JUST ONE ITEM. JUST WANT TO GET BETTER FOR CLARIFICATION -- IT IS OUR EXPECTATION -- THE WAY IT'S FRAME BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS THAT THE INDEPENDENT UNIT. THAT WE ARE NOW BUILDING AS A RESULT THAT THAT WILL SERVE -- BOTH HOUSES. WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE AND THE LION'S SHARE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS. BUT IF IT'S JUST BEING CANDID CULMINATING AT LONDON'S ON THE LINE HERE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS YES WE ARE CLEAR THAT FOR SOME INVESTIGATIONS WILL STILL HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE COUNSEL -- THIS POLICY ASYLUM ON THAT THAT IS A NEW ISSUE THAT WILL AGAIN PUT IN THE AND THE PARKING LOT I BOTH HOUSES PERHAPS IS COMMITTEE WILL NEED TO ADDRESS BUT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. ON IN BUILDING THIS NEW POLICY. OUR DESIRE WAS. TO WHEN AT ALL POSSIBLE BRING INVESTIGATIONS BACK IN HOUSE. WE HAVE A BIT OF A KNEE JERK REACTION OVER THE LAST YEAR. AND BASICALLY FARMED EVERYTHING OUT EXTERNALLY. IN OUR EFFORT TO GIVE THE IT. IT HEIGHTENED PUBLIC CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY INVALIDITY OF THE INVESTIGATIONS WE'RE CLEAR BASALLY EXPERTS WE HAVE TALKED TO A THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD AND THEREFORE ARE PROPOSING. AN IN HOUSE INDEPENDENT UNIT. BUT AGAIN WE HOPE WILL DO THE LINE SHARE SO WE'VE HEARD YOU IT WAS NOT A PART OF THE POLICY AT THAT'S DEATHLESS AT THAT WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER NO NINE AND I APPRECIATE IT VERY WHERE ABOUT THE IN THE INDEPENDENT UNIT -- JUST GONNA BE CANDID SACRAMENTO STATE [inaudible] HAD ATTORNEYS THEY WERE INTERVIEWING SENATE STAFF. AND ARE SENATE STAFF. I WENT COULD POTENTIALLY GOING TO THESE INTERVIEWS [inaudible] I'M REPRESENTED THAT'S I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GONNA COVER THAT I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU ADD OR TAKE AWAY FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT'S ONE ITEM AS WE GO FORWARD I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THAT MEN CHAIRMAN OF CO CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE WONDERFUL WORK ALONG WITH THE COMMITTEE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE [inaudible] SENATE MITCHELL. US SENATOR MORAL AND COMMISSION CHAIRMAN AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR OBSERVING THE MEETINGS AND AND BEING IN THE ROOM I REALLY IMPRESSED -- AND AND SINCE YOU WERE THERE -- WE DID HAVE A LOT OF WITNESSES ATTACKING WHAT WE'RE DOING OR WHAT WAS BEING PROPOSED HERE. AB BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A WHISPERING CAMPAIGN IN THE MEDIA. AND SO ARE YOU ARE YOU YOU HAVE GIVEN US A LETTER [inaudible] WILL THIS. INDIVIDUAL BE PRESENTING UNDER PUBLIC COMMENTS. THAT WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE RECORD THE ACID BE ENTERED IN THE RECORD AT CLOSING HIM UNTIL WE WILL. PRO WE WILL DO THAT. OF CAM JUST. CURIOUS DE I HAVE HAVE HAVE YOU SEEN THE LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED. OR MAYBE JUST FOR I JUST SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME AS I WALKED INTO THIS HEARING SO I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO ACTUALLY READ THE WHOLE LETTER -- BUT WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT WILL BE ENTERED IN. PUBLIC COMMENTS I JUST WANTED IT MAYBE SOMEWHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE JUST TO RESPOND BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT IT IS. WE TRIED TO ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS OF THE BOTH OF YOU. I THINK WE'VE DONE IT AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. WE FIGHT WOULD I DISPLAY HERE FOR THE ME TOO MOVEMENT TO SAY HEY WE WERE TRYING. AND SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE JUST ANOTHER LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED I DON'T THIS NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW IS HE HAS NO CONNECTION WITH THE MEAT TO WOMEN WHO HAVE WE'VE BEEN TALKING. TO ABOUT THIS UP POLICY THEY HAPPEN BRIEFED. THEY HAVE PUBLICLY THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA EXPRESSED THEIR GENERAL SUPPORT YOU KNOW I DON'T SPEAK FOR THEM -- THEY WERE HERE ACTUALLY AT THE LAST HEARING TOO YOU KNOW. UGH UGH GIVE THEIR INPUT INTO THE POLICY TO SOME EXTENT. AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE COULD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. LETTER THAT YOU THAT THAT I SAW DID NOT HAVE A CONNECTION AS FAR AS I KNOW. WITH -- ANY MEANS THAT I DON'T THINK YOU RECORDS REPRESENTED AS HAVING ANY CONNECTION WITH THE ME TOO I'M. GROUP. YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. MAYBE WE'LL HEAR MORE UNDER PUBLIC COMMENTS BUT I JUST WANTED. TO SEE IF YOU WANT TO DO IT ADDRESSED LEASE THE POINTS OF THIS. ONE NOW. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VERY GOOD. US CENTERS SKINNER [inaudible] THANK YOU. APPRECIATION TO OUR CHAIRS AND TO THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORKING TO THE STAFF. MY QUESTION IS. WE DIDN'T SO MUCH TALK ABOUT WERE. IN ITS NOT SO MUCH IN THE POLICY. AND I REALIZE THAT EACH SETTING CAST TO BE -- EACH SITUATION [inaudible] ON WOLF. WHATEVER THE REMEDY IS WILL BE UNIQUE TO THAT SITUATION BUT WHAT I'M REFERRING TO US WHAT ONCE SOMETHING'S BEEN INVESTIGATED. AND IT SUSTAINED. THAT WHAT THEN ARE THE CONSEQUENCES AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRAINING SO OBVIOUSLY WITHIN OUR OWN STAFF THERE MAY BE -- SOME TYPE OF INTERVENTIONS LIKE THAT BUT I WAS STRUCK BY. THE EMPLOYEE SURVEY WHERE WOULD INDICATE AT LEAST FROM THOSE WHO RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY. THAT THERE. SEEMS TO BE A HIGHER INCIDENCE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTERNAL YES SOME OTHER WORDS BEING HARASSED BY A SALE LOBBYIST REPUBLIC NO HARD BILLION HAVE CONSEQUENCES. ON A PUBLIC IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO HIM SAYING A DISTRICT OFFICE IT WOULDN'T BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO IN EFFECT BEYOND THEM FROM ATTENDING ART TOO SHOWING UP AT OUR DISTRICT OFFICES NEW -- BUT WITH LOBBYIST WHAT. DID THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED AT ALL WHAT TYPE OF REAL REMEDIES. WE MIGHT HAVE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL WITHOUT KNOWING LEGALLY WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T DO. I IT'S HARD TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND WE YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT YET CERTAINLY THAT'S A TOPIC FOR ONGOING DISCUSSION I WILL SAY THAT WE'VE HAD THE SUGGESTION COME IN FROM SOME. MEMBERS OF THE LOBBY CORPS. THAT WOULD PERHAPS WE SHOULD EXPLORE AND THIS IS GONNA SOUND RADICAL AND I HOW I CAN JUST SAY THIS WITHOUT HAVING SPOKEN TO VERY MANY PEOPLE. ASKING OF SOME OF THOSE LOBBYISTS WOULD SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO OUR PROCESS SO THAT IF AN ALLEGATION OF AN INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO GET UP FOR A LOBBYIST. MAYBE THEY WOULD COME IN FRONT OF THE SAME PANEL IN FRONT OF OUR PANEL. SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT HAVE TO SUBJECT HIMSELF TO THAT WILLINGLY WE CAN'T FORCE THEM. TO THE PANEL CAN STILL INVESTIGATE. A CLAIM LIKE THAT -- BUT THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD WANT TO PARTICIPATE -- SOMETIMES YOU WANT THE OTHER SIDE GIVING THEIR POINT YOU KNOW THE WHAT THE SUBJECT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND WE CAN'T FORCE THEM TO DO THAT THIS POINT. BUT THESE ARE ALL THINGS TO BE EXPLORED YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD. SO THAT DOES RAISE. CAN'T FORCE THEM. WE WOULD STILL DO THE INVESTIGATION BUT THEN WE WOULD ONLY BE IF IF THE PERSON ACCUSED. DID NOT INTERACT WITH OUR INVESTIGATORS WE WOULD ONLY HAVE THE VERSION OF OUR OWN STAFF -- I I DON'T HAVE THE ANY ANSWER BUT I IF IF IN FACT. THERE IS SEE PLAY I DON'T WANT TO EVEN SAY A HIGH LIKELIHOOD RIGHT I JUST WANNA SAY IFS. ENOUGH STAFF OF EXPERIENCE THAT THAT THEY RESPONDED IN THE SURVEY. THEIR ABILITY TO FEEL SATISFIED. THAT WE ARE CREATING A WORKPLACE WHERE THEY CAN FEEL SAFE. WE WILL NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF YEP. WE WE WILL IN AND I THINK EVEN WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SUBJECT OF AN INVESTIGATION IF THE DISK WITH THE PANEL WERE DETERMINED THAT THERE'S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT IN. INCIDENT OR MULTIPLE INCIDENCES OCCURRED -- THEREIN THERE AREN'T CURRENTLY. I THINK THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND CAN BE DONE IN TERMS OF NOT ALLOWING. CERTAIN MEMBERS BE CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO GO TO CERTAIN OFFICES -- THAT'S NOT BEEN UNHEARD OF IN THIS BUILDING SO EVEN WITHOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION THERE ARE SOME. SOME THERE SOME ABILITY WITH WITH SOME -- PRETENSION OF EMPLOYEES -- THE BUT IN TERMS BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN WITHOUT US KNOWING THE FOR WITHOUT THE COMMITTEE HAVING EXPORT THE FULL RANGE OF LEGAL RESPONSES I COULDN'T TELL YOU BUT BUT NOW WE KNOW FROM OUR CLIMATE SURVEY THAT FIND OUT WHAT GOES RANGERS ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT IN POLICY. WERE PREPARED SO THAT PEOPLE AREN'T SCRAMBLING AT THE MOMENT THAT REPORT COMES IN THAT WE KNOW. HOW THAT WILL BE INVESTIGATED HOW WILL BE ADJUDICATED AND WHAT THE POTENTIAL? OUR RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE FROM PANEL BECAUSE THE ONLY TO BE INFORMED AS WELL IF THERE'S A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE. HERE'S WHAT YOUR ABILITY IS TO RECOMMEND SO WE'VE HEARD -- AND I THINK THAT LEGAL COUNSEL HAS HEARD AS WE DEVELOP THIS POLICY AND AS WE INSTRUCT OUR NEW. PANEL THEY'LL NEED TO KNOW WHAT TOOLS THEY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL AS WELL SO. IF I WOULD JUST THAT. MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- WE HAD SOME CONVERSATION WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THE CLIMATE SURVEY TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE THERE WOULD MEMBERS WHO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE 46% SPOT IT RIGHT -- I WOULD ARGUE -- THAT TO THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO CHOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE. ON PI THINK -- ARE FOLLOW UP IN HANDLING OF AN AND AN ISSUE THAT. SURFACED AS A RESULT OF THE CLIMATE SERBIAN THEM AS A RESULT OF YOUR CAR CO WORKERS IN YOUR FELLOW LET STAFF WHO DID PARTICIPATE. ALL HOPEFULLY WILL BE AN INDICATION OF OUR COMMITMENT TWO TAKING THE TEMPERATURE CHECK OF LEGISLATIVE STAFF EXPERIENCE AND DEVELOPING POLICIES AS A RESULT THAT WAS VERY TELLING AND WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ITS NOT BLACK OR WHITE. ALL BUT WE ARE CLEAR THAT IT'S A PROBLEM IN IN I THINK COLLECTIVELY AS THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN'T DO WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT YET. BUT I HOPE THAT THAT ALL STAFF WILL RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF A CLIMATE SURVEY IN COMMUNICATING YOUR EXPERIENCES TO YOUR EMPLOYER AND ALLOWING US THE OPPORTUNITY. TO THEN RESPOND SO WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS. WOULD WE WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE SAYING INCIDENT OF AN EXTERNAL PERSON LEXUS USE AN EXAMPLE OF A LOBBYIST OR LOBBYIST'S HARASSES. SOMEONE IN THE BUILDING THE BUILDING CODE THE PERSON THE STAFFORD COMPLAINTS IT'S INVESTIGATED. AND WHETHER OR NOT THE LOBBYIST PARTICIPATED OR NOT THE INVESTIGATION FEELS THAT THE THAT THE COMPLAINT IS SUSTAINABLE [inaudible] THAT CIRCUMSTANCE ONCE WE FACE THAT THAT WE WOULD THINK ABOUT COGNOS SO WE SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT ABSENT IN TERMS OF IF I MAY ON THAT WORD OBSERVATION JUST AS SOMEONE WHO SAT THROUGH THEIR HEARING. IT BEFORE YOU GO SHOPPING. I THINK THE POINTTHAT SENATOR MITCHELL HIGHLIGHTED THE HIGH LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT OF OUR POLICE CURRY BECOMES ACTION ASSET TO OUR ORGANIZATION AS WE TRY TO MOVE FORWARD. WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A A REDIRECTION INSTITUTION REFORM IN THE ROAD. TAKE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND I THINK THE HIGH LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT. COUPLED WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO FOCUS ON IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING BYSTANDER TRAINING. REALLY WANT TO TAKE THAT ENGAGEMENT AND HAVE EVERYONE KIND OF OWN THESE ISSUES. AND STARTED SO MY QUESTION JUDGE IN SO MUCH AS TO WHETHER THE EMPLOYEE FEEL SATISFIED AS MUCH AS IT'S WHETHER WE HAVE A REMEDY FOR THAT EXTERNAL. HARASSER SO AT AT WHAT WE'RE ASKING TODAY IS THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER AND AND VOTE ON ON THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK. THE WORK IS NOT DONE. AND SO THIS IS THIS IS A FRAMEWORK OKAY THERE'S STILL WORK THAT WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE AT THE STAFF LEVEL -- AS WELL AS THROUGH THROUGH GUIDANCE FROM -- A LEGISLATORS IN TERMS OF REALLY PUTTING THE MEAT ON THE BONES THIS IS A FALLS IN THE MEAT ON THE BONES CATEGORY FOR ME AND THE SKINNER. SO IT'S NOT WE PASS THIS WE'RE DONE. A RACE NO LIES REALLY KIND OF THE ASPIRATIONAL GOAL SET FORWARD IN THIS FRAMEWORK. SO SO FIGURING OUT BILL ARE ARE LEGALLY TALES FOR EXACTLY FIGURED OUT HOW FAR WE CAN GO A LEGALLY IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH EXTERNAL PEOPLE -- THAT WORK WHO IS GOING TO CONTINUE APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION AND THEN CHAIR. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A MOTION BUT AND AND WHATEVER POINT I WILL MOVE THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS. WILL TAKE A LITTLE MORE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM ARE LESS SAFE COUNSEL WHO WILL GET TO THE POINT OF A MOTION. AND IT MAY FALL TO ONE OF OUR SHARES OF ARE GOING TO BE FINE. BEHIND AND BY THE WAY THAT THE POINT YOU BRING UP IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT PART OF THIS IS WHEN YOU MAKE A POINT LIKE THAT IN EVERY OF THE SORT OF GENERAL CONSENSUS HERE. THEIR HEARING US THAT LEGISLATIVE COUNCILS THEY DEVELOP THIS YOU'RE HEARING US AND KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT A PART OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM. TO NOW FLUSH OUT AND I THINK THAT THEY'VE HEARD VERY CLEARLY FROM SEVERAL OF YOU THAT THAT POINT ABOUT. WHAT WE DO WITH OUTSIDE PEOPLE IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY NEED TO REALLY -- MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE POLICY IN THAT IT'S PUT IN PLACE AS SOON AS WE CAN SO THAT IT'S READY TO GO IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THAT SHOULD COMMON [inaudible] SENATOR ROTH. YOU MISTER CHAIR -- DURING THE PRESENTATION YOU. I'VE KNOWLEDGE THAT OBVIOUSLY -- ES COMPLAINTS COMMENCEMENT WILL PERTAIN TO HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND SOME WILL NOT SO AS WE YOU WE TRIAGE. THESE COMPLAINTS AND COMPLAINANTS AND REFER THEM. BETWEEN THE YEAR THE INDEPENDENT UNIT AND HR OR PERHAPS SOME OTHER OFFICE. THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE RISKS THAT -- SOME WILL DROP TO THE CRACKS. SO I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ARE -- TO ONE HOW HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN AND TO WHO DO WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE COMPLAINANT SMOOTHLY TRANSITION IN THE PROCESS BETWEEN THE INDEPENDENT UNIT. OF THE VARIOUS HR OFFICES AND PERHAPS SOME OTHER OFFICE THAT SET UP. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO THAT WHENEVER AN INCIDENT COMES INTO THE UNIT -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AMERICAN NATION IS THAT IT'S THE PANEL ITSELF THAT ACTUALLY EVALUATES EACH OF THESE TAKES A LOOK AT IT AND SAYS SOMETHING THAT THEY MIGHT SEE SOMEONE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT EVEN IF THIS IS ALL TRUE THIS DOES NOT FALL UNDER OUR PURVIEW THIS REALLY. NEEDS TO GO TO HR BECAUSE THIS IS JUST PEOPLE NOT GETTING ALONG OR WHATEVER IT IS. SO THE PANEL WOULD BE THE ONE TO WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO BE HEARING THE CASE DURING THE INCIDENT ADJUDICATING IT OR WHETHER IT'S GOING TO GO BACK TO HR ONCE THEY SEND IT OFF. I WOULD EXPECT THIS SORT OF THAT THAT HR IF IT GOES TO HR THAT BILL ON THE DO WHATEVER FOLLOW UP EVALUATION THEY NEED TO DO AND THEN THEY'LL NEED TO ISSUE A LETTER AT SOME POINT TO THE COMPLAINING PARTY. WHERE THE REPORTING PARTY TO AS WE SAID THAT THAT RESPONSE BACK TO THE PERSON WHO REPORTS THE INCIDENT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE THAT IT'S NOT JUST? THIS INDEPENDENT UNIT THAT DOES THAT KIND OF RESPONSE THAT HR ALSO IS TASKED WITH RESPONDING ON EACH UNIT LIKE THAT THAT COMES INTO. MY EACH INCIDENT THAT COMES AND I ASSUME THAT IS WE WE'RE NOT SETTING UP A DETAILED PROCEDURES HERE IN IS THE DETAILED PROCEDURES ARE SET UP. WILL BE A TRACKING MECHANISM SO THICK SO A COMPLAINT AND THE COMPLAINT IT CAN BE TRACKED THROUGH THE PROCESS WHETHER IT'S FROM THE INDEPENDENT. UNIT TWO HR TO HR TO SOME OTHER OFFICE AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SIZE SUMAR LEADERSHIP WILL BE ABLE TO TRACK A COMPLAINT WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE HANDLED AT THE INDEPENDENT UNIT OR THE UNIT DETERMINE THE DETERMINES THAT IT'S NOT AND REFERS TO COMPLAIN THAT HR. THERE'S A TRACKING AND THEN THERE'S AN OUTCOME AND THERE'S A TIME LINE AND ALL THAT SO ABSOLUTELY AND SINCE IT DIDN'T COME UP ALSO MENTIONED THAT THESE COMPLAINTS THAT DO COME INTO THE UNIT THAT ARE SUBSTANDARD ARE SUSTAIN THEY WILL BE KEPT TO MEAN THOSE RECORDS WILL BE RETAINED. SO THAT OVER TIME -- WITH THEY'LL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE IF PARTICULAR EMPLOYEES ARE HAVING AN UNUSUALLY HIGH NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT SUSTAIN PROFOUND. OKAY PERFECT NATURE OF THANK YOU MISTER. VERY GOOD -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER REMARKS RURAL. TRANSITION TO DYNAMIC WHERE WIRELESS CHIEF COUNSEL. FOR THE NEXT STEP AND THEN PUBLIC COMMENT AND AT ACTION. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OF COURSE. OUR CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND ALL THE PANEL MEMBERS FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS. MS BOYER VINE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I BROUGHT WITH ME MY ACTING CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER. IF WE END UP GETTING INTO THE WEEDS AND ANYTHING -- I WANNA THANK YOU FOR AND TRUSTING TO THE OFFICE THIS -- EFFORT TO ASSIST INSURING THAT YOU HAVE AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS IN HANDLING THESE WORKPLACE HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW pWHAT STEPS IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET TO JUST. THAT THE KIND OF BARE BONES AND YOU ASK A LOT OF REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS IN THIS HEARING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ON MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THIS IN PLACE BY EARLY. TWENTY NINETEEN AND SO THERE ARE SEVERAL STEPS ALONG THE WAY. I BREAK THOSE DOWN INTO CATEGORIES -- THOSE OUR STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION PERSONNEL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FACILITIES AND BUDGET. A IF -- WE AREN'T THE OPINION THAT WE NEED STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION TO BE ABLE TO ENCOMPASS THIS UNIT WITH AND OTHER WORK AT THE OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND SO WE'VE BEEN PREPARING BILL LANGUAGE FOR INTRODUCTION. IN AUGUST ON IN TERMS OF PERSONNEL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE OFFICE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL IS A CIVIL SERVICE AGENCY. SO WE MUST FOLLOW THE RULES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE BY CAL HR IN OUR PROCESS OF HIRING FOLKS. HAVING SAID THAT WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS -- SINCE HE LEARNED ABOUT THE LA COUNTY MODEL WE TALK ABOUT WORKLOAD WAS -- WITHIN YOUR HR UNITS. AND DECIDED THAT. THE LEVEL OF STAFFING WE WOULD NEED WOULD BE AN ATTORNEY MANAGER FOR THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT TO ATTORNEY INVESTIGATORS A SUPPORT STAFF AND OF COURSE YOUR FIVE ON PANEL MEMBERS -- THE MANAGER WOULD BE APPOINTED BY USING ONE OF THE TWO EXAMPLE SESSIONS OF THE OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS SO THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. WE STILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE TURN YET SEEM RE CLASSIFICATION OF THE POSITION TO THE LEVEL WE'RE GOING TO APPOINT THE PERSON AT AND THEN AFTER THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO RECRUIT FOR THAT POSITION. INTERVIEW THE APPLICANTS AND THEN HIRE THE MANAGER IT'S THE GOAL TO GET THAT MANAGER IN PLACE FIRST TO HELP US THEN BUILD OUT THE REST OF THIS UNIT. IN ADDITION TO THE MANAGER WE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HIRING PROCESS FOR THE TWO SENIOR ATTORNEY IS -- WHO WE WOULD ANTICIPATE WOULD HAVE EMPLOYMENT LAW EXPERIENCE AND ONE CLERICAL STAFF PERSON? AND THEN FINALLY ONCE THE PANEL MEMBERS ARE SELECTED BY. THIS BODY THROUGH THE PROCESS -- WE WOULD PREPARE THE CONTRACTS FOR THOSE PANEL MEMBERS MY UNDERSTANDING IS AN ALLEY COUNTY THIS PANEL MEMBERS ARE UNDER CONTRACT SO WE WOULD HAVE. A YEAR CONTRACT -- WITH A BASE AMOUNT THAT THEY WOULD WORK AGAINST. A I'VE ASKED THE LEGISLATIVE DATA CENTER TO WORK ON THE INFAMOUS NATION TECHNOLOGY NEEDS AT A MINIMUM THERE NEEDS TO BE A FIREWALL BETWEEN MY LITIGATION ATTORNEYS AND THIS PANEL BECAUSE WE REPRESENT. MEMBERS AND STAFF IN THERE ARE LITIGATION MATTERS THAT COME OUT OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A REPORTING WEBSITE HOTLINE AND A CASE MANAGEMENT TOOL SENATOR ROTH ALLUDED TO TO TRACK COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS AND FINAL DISCIPLINE. I THE UNIT HAS TO BE HOUSE SOMEWHERE DOWN TOWN AND SACRAMENTO CURRENTLY THE OFFICE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS SPACE ELEVEN HUNDRED JAY STREET AND NINE TWENTY FIVE L. STREET. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE WITHIN THE VICINITY OF THE CAPITOL IN LOOKING FOR THAT SPACE WERE AWARE OF THE NEED TO HAVE A SENSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY FOR FOLKS WHO ARE COMING THERE. AND ALSO OF SECURITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THE SPACE SO TO FIND THAT RIGHT SPACE NEGOTIATE A LEASE. A MAYBE MAKE TENANT IMPROVEMENTS CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT WE'VE ALREADY ENGAGED OR BROKER TO LOOK FOR SPACE AND ACTUALLY SAW SOME PRETTY GOOD SPACE LAST FRIDAY THAT. MIGHT WORK OUT -- FINALLY THEY'LL HAVE TO BE AN ARGUMENT AUGMENTATION TO THE BUDGET AND THAT AUGMENTATION RECOVER ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL SALARIES AND THE OPERATING EXPENSES AND THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE UNIT. THAT'S A QUICK FIVE MINUTE OVER. BRIEF IT BRIEFING OF THIS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTIONS MANY MEMBERS YES. ZERO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. PROCESS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE END OF THE PRESENTATION. FROM YOUR END OR IT IS. WHO OKAY OKAY? THEN LET'S GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY SHARE HOW DOES THAT WORK EXACTLY -- IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE CONDUCTING THIS INVESTIGATION AND THOROUGH VETTING. WHO DO YOU RESPOND? TO HOW DOES IT WORK SO THAT'S ONE HOW DOES IT WORK IF A MEMBER COMES TO YOU VERSES A STAFFER NO. SO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THIS AREA TWO OKAY. RIGHT TIME BUT THAT'S OKAY AND AND I'M AND I HAVE A THOROUGH BUT WHY DON'T I ALLOW YOU TO START. ANSWERING AND THEN ALL. SENATOR HANNAH IS GOING TO BE INDEPENDENT OF I'M NOT GOING TO BE CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION JOE HAVE A PROCESS WHERE THERE'S INTAKE. UNTIL BE INTAKE ATTORNEYS AN INTAKE CLERICAL STAFF THEY WILL TRIAGE AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THEY THEN THE ATTORNEYS WILL INVESTIGATE THE FACTS. GET THE FACTS GATHERED FOR THE PANEL MEMBERS WAY UNDERSTAND WORKS IN LA AND THEN THE PANEL MEMBERS WILL MAKE THE DETERMINATION WILL FULL ACCESS THOSE FACTS. THE SITE YOU ASSESS WITNESSES DECIDE WHETHER THIS IS BEEN SUBSTANTIATED. AND WHETHER THERE'S A LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE THEY WOULD RECOMMEND-AND BACK TO THE INDIVIDUAL RULES COMMITTEES. PUT THAT AND LET LET ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT MISS BOYER VINE IS USING THE TERM ATTORNEYS WE'VE USED THE TERM INVESTIGATORS WILL WE TALKED ABOUT THE UNIT. AND SO I JUST THINK FOR CONSISTENT IT SAYS SINCE HE LEFT THE INVESTIGATOR FOR THE THIRD UNIT. OKAY AND AND IT WOULD BE INTO. LET'S COUNSEL AND SO WHEN YOU SAY IF IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY MEAN WHO PAYS FOR THE UNIT. ONE THAT THAT PLAYS IN THE LEGISLATURE A ROLE AS WELL THE LEGISLATURE OKAY SO THEN THEIR FIRST RESPONSE BACK IS GOING TO BE. TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OR TWO RULES COMMITTEE. WHO EXACTLY SO -- IN EUROPE FOLDER YOU SHOULD HAVE A POWER POINT THAT WE WALK THROUGH THAT TALKS ABOUT NOT ONLY THE BEST TO GET TO VIEW IT. BUT ALSO THIS INDEPENDENT PANEL THAT WE ARE PROPOSING ALSO. AND THAT IF THE INVESTIGATION WARRANTS. THE THE PANEL WITHIN DETERMINE AND TAKE ACTION THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE IT DOESN'T WANT GOING TO THE PANEL IT WOULD GO BACK TO THE RESPECTIVE HOT ROUTE RULES COMMITTEES [inaudible] OKAY. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. CHAIR I HOPE. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME OF AND THE LATITUDE I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TO WHAT EXTENT THE INVESTIGATION HAS ITS OWN ABILITY. TO PROCEED. AND NOW IT'S IT'S SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IS. BASED ON ALSO THE CREDIBILITY THAT WERE ABLE TO OPERATE IN. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET AT SO SO THE THE OUR DESIRE IN CREATING THIS NEW BICAMERAL INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIVE UNIT. IS TO REALLY DO OTHER THINGS IS TO IS TO GIVE US ALL THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE TRAINED SKILLED INVESTIGATORS. WHO FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CASES -- CAN TAKE THEM IF YOU WILL FROM SOUP TO NUTS -- AND THAT THAT POINT LET'S INVESTIGATION IS DONE AND THEY HAVE A REPORT -- CAN THEN TAKE IT PROVIDED TO THE PANEL. WHO WILL HEAR IT AND MAKE A DETERMINATION? AND THAT RECOMMENDATION WILL GO TO RULES COMMITTEE [inaudible] OR IF INDEED IT JUST NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE INDIVIDUAL -- HR DEPARTMENTS IN BOTH HOUSES. FOR THE NEXT STEP. AND IN JUST THE LAST QUESTION GOING BACK TO THE IF A COMPLAINT COMES FROM A STAFFER IN GOES DIRECTLY TO ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS AND AND OR THAT THE INVESTIGATORS -- JUST. MAINTAINING THE SANCTITY OF THE PROCESS HOW WILL THAT. THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE INVESTIGATOR WOULD BE DIRECTLY WITH THAT STAFFER THAT'S CORRECT AND SO NOTHING IS GONNA BE -- THERE'S GOING TO BE NO OTHER INTERVENTION. THAT'S CORRECT IN THAT PROCESS CORRECT PICKUP [inaudible] THANK YOU. VERY GOOD TO US THANK YOU. I AM BLESSED COUNCIL TIME OR FIND. WE'LL NOW TAKE PUBLIC TESTIMONY A WRITTEN TEST ONE WHO SUBMITTED THIS MORNING BY -- JOHN BYRNE AND THAT. DISPLAY HAS BEEN SUBMITTED THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON RULES AND IS HEREBY ENTERED IN THE RECORD HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED -- OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY. PLEASE APPROACH THE MIKE AND THIS ONE I SAW A SHOOTING A MISTER CHAIRMAN BROWSING. FORGIVE ME BUT I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE BEFORE. WAITING FOR ALL THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY I JUST WANTED TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE OUR PROPOSED -- MOTION UNDER OF ONE BE HA I HAVE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH OUR CHAIR WOMEN. ARE REGARDING WHEN WE'RE SAY REPORT AND WE'RE LEAVING GOING TO LEAVE THAT DISCRETION -- GOING FORWARD TO WHAT REPORT SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE REALLY MINOR AS WE DISCUSS FOR SOMEONE USES AN INAPPROPRIATE TERM. IN DISCUSSING WITH YOU KNOW ONE OF THE OF STAFFERS ARE SOME OF THOSE WILL BE MINOR AND NOT NECESSARILY PART OF A REPORT THAT. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE CHAIR WOMAN THAT. IN IN THAT AREA SO ENSURE VOTING ON THIS -- CHAIRWOMAN MAY WANT TO ELABORATE ON THAT BUT I CERTAINLY AGREE BECAUSE IT WAS. ON THE MEN THAT WE PROPOSED IN THE SUB COMMITTEE SO THAT EVERYONE IS RECEIVING THE REPORT AT THE SAME TIME AND THERE CAN'T BE ANY SUSPICION THAT FROM THE BURIED SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT ON AN INDIVIDUAL IN PARTICULAR MEMBERS OF OUR MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE EYESIGHT AND MAKE THAT CLEAR BECAUSE I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE AND THEN IF YOU WILL THE ROLE OF PANICKING. SCOTT. HOW TO ADD MY TWO CENTS THAT? NO I THINK THAT THANK YOU. CENTER BATES. I THINK OF THIS ADDITION IS. REALLY TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ONE THERE WHEN A REPORTERS BEEN DONE. AND IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE ILL GO THE FULL SENATE RULES COMMITTEE AGO THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY. ASSEMBLY RULES COMMITTEE SO THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY THAT ONE PARTY GETS IT THE OTHER PARTY DOESN'T. I SEE THAT IS TRYING. TO CONFRONT THIS ISSUE OF POWER REDUCE POWER MAY THINGS GO AWAY. AND AND SO I THINK THAT IS A TRUST OF THOSE CHANGES I THINK YOU'RE QUITE CONSTRUCTIVE. I THINK THE POINT YOU RAISE IN THAT. NOT EVER REPORT BAY ELEVATOR THAT LEVEL IS SOMETHING THAT MAY BE SEVEN FIND AS TIME GOES ON BUT I THINK. IN THAT SENSE THE USE OF THE WORD REPORT THAT SAID IN HIS A SMALL POINT. AS COMPARED THIS LARGER ONE OF MAKING SURE THAT IT IS A BI PARTISAN DISCLOSURE OF THE FINDING. BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY GOES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL DYNAMIC. THAT IS AN OUT WORKING OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS -- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT OBSERVATION [inaudible] AND SO WHAT THAT -- HERE'S WHAT DISAPPEARS IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND TAKE A JOINT HOUSE.
