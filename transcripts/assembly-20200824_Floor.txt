MEMBERS I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO OBSERVE PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS AND KEEP THE VOLUME LEVEL MANAGEABLE WE HAVE LOTS OF BUSINESS BEFORE THE BODY THIS WEEK. AND PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO DOCTOR WOULD DOCTOR WOULD YOU MAIL BEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY THREE BY SENATOR HILL. SB SEVEN NINETY THREE IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES PARENTS K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY YOUNG FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA PLANNED PARENTHOOD THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION KAISER AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION ALL PROPONENTS OF PROP FIFTY SIX WHICH INCREASE THE TO PAY TAXES ON TOBACCO A FEW YEARS BACK. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR WORLDWIDE ARE KILLED BY THE TOBACCO PRODUCTS IT'S THE MOST DEADLY CONSUMER PRODUCT EVER CREATED. THIS IS. MEMBERS. PLEASE YOUR ATTENTION TO DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'LL SAY AGAIN ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION TOBACCO KILLS MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR WORLDWIDE IT IS THE MOST DEADLY CONSUMER PRODUCT EVER CREATED TOBACCO USE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DISEASE DISABILITY AND DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES. MORE THAN SIXTEEN MILLION AMERICANS ARE LIVING WITH THE SMOKING CAUSES CANCER HEART DISEASE AND LUNG DISEASES DIABETES AND CHRONIC CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE WHICH INCLUDES EMPHYSEMA AND CHRONIC BRONCHITIS THE STATE SPENDS OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE TREATMENT OF SMOKING RELATED RELATED ILLNESSES IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM ALONE WHILE OVERALL HEALTH EXPENDITURES ON THIS IS OVER THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE NUMBER AND SMOKERS IN CALIFORNIA IS LOWER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN MANY YEARS THAT MEANS BIG TOBACCO IS WORKING HARDER THAN EVER TO TRACK THE NEXT GENERATION OF TO THEIR DEADLY. IN 201867% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO USED TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN THE LAST THIRTY DAYS REPORTED USING A FLAVORED PRODUCT ONE OF THE MOST PIC PUT POPULAR FLAVOURS IS MENTHOL. THE CDC SAYS QUOTE TOBACCO COMPANIES USE ADMIN PAUL TO MAKE CIGARETTES SEEM LESS HARSH AND MORE APPEALING TO NEW SMOKERS AND YOUNG AND QUOTE I SPENT MY ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL CAREER TRYING TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE RAVAGES OF TOBACCO ADDICTION I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND GUN DISEASE TOOTH LOSS IN ORAL CANCER STUDY SO SHE DID WAS SMOKING AND SMOKELESS TOBACCO PRODUCTS. I'LL NEVER FORGET SOME PATIENTS WHO EVEN WHILE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION FROM PRINT CANCER SOCI WITH TOBACCO CONTINUE TO SMOKE THEY JUST COULDN'T QUIT. YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE WHO SAID THE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE WAS TO START SMOKING I LOVE WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND COUGHING AS I REACH FOR THAT FIRST SMOKE I. REALLY ENJOY THE FACT THAT IT TAKES ME LONGER TO GET OVER A COLD. I LOVE THE FRESH HOW FRESH MY HOUSE IN MY CAR SMELL MY CLOTHES SMELL AFTER I'VE BEEN SMOKING. INSTEAD MORE THAN NEVER STARTED. NINE OUT OF TEN SMART- SMOKERS START BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND NINETY NINE PERCENT. BY THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. AND FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS. THIS BILL WILL BAN THE SALE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN RETAIL STORES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS INCLUDES VAPING PRODUCTS IN THOSE LITTLE CIGARS THE SECOND MOST POPULAR PRODUCT AMONG HIGH SCHOOLERS WITH FLAVORS LIKE MANGO TROPICAL FUSION IN CHOCOLATE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MORE. EASEL CIGARS OFFERS LOW AS A DOLLAR FORTY NINE FOR TWO OF THE SECOND MOST POPULAR PRODUCT AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN BIG TOBACCO IS WORKING HARD TO MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO SELL THESE. WELL THE OPPOSITION IS BENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FIGHTING THIS LEGISLATION POINT TO THE EXEMPTIONS MADE ALONG THE WAY. THE COURT THIS BILL DESIGNED TO PROTECT KIDS REMAINS INTACT. IN A PERFECT WORLD THERE WOULD BE NO EXEMPTIONS IN THIS BILL BUT WE ALL KNOW WE DON'T LIVE IN A PERFECT WORLD. WHETHER IT'S VAPING SMOKELESS TOBACCO CIGARETTES ARE SMALL CIGARS WE KNOW THE FLAVORS ATTRACT KIDS THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF SMOKERS AT BIG TOBACCO NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO PEDDLE THEIR DEADLY PRODUCTS. THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE TO ME ANYWAY. VOTE YES TO HELP PROTECT KIDS OR VOTE NO. TO PROTECT BIG TOBACCO THE CHOICE IS YOURS. I'D SAY ONE MORE THING THAT'S RELATED TO POTENTIAL LOSS OF TAX REVENUE WITH WHICH I'VE HEARD THE OPPOSITION SPEAK UP. SHOULD THIS BILL PASS AGAIN I WOULD NOTE THAT. ALL OF THE COALITION SUPPORTERS FOR PROP FIFTY SIX THE MOST RECENT TOBACCO TAX LEGISLATION ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT HAD BEEN WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM MERCED WHO IS LOOKING AT A BEIPING TAX IT MAY NOT HAPPEN THIS YEAR BUT I'M COMMITTED TO WORK WITH HIM ON ON I BUT I AGREE WITH THE STRUCTURE. AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT HELLO IF WE CAN'T DO THIS YEAR I LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING THAT A REALITY IN A TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIRTY SECONDS DOCTOR WITH WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR HUGE DOWNSTREAM SAVINGS ON HEALTH CARE COSTS TO TREAT TOBACCO RELATED TO DISEASES. I WOULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER THE REVENUE LOSS AS AN INVESTMENT PREVENTION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS. SOMETHING WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO MORE OF IN THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DR WAIT. MISTER BLOWN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON TOBACCO RELATED ISSUES FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE IT'S NOW OVER TWENTY YEARS. TOBACCO IS AN ADDICTIVE POISON AND THE INDUSTRY MODEL DEPENDS IT DEPENDS. ON HOOKING PEOPLE AT AN EARLY AGE. THE RANGE OF LONG TERM HEALTH ISSUES ARISING FROM TOBACCO USE AND SECONDHAND SMOKE IS WELL KNOWN TO ALL OF YOU AND WELL RESEARCHED CURRENTLY WE ARE LEARNING MORE AND MORE ABOUT THE COMORBIDITIES OF COVERT NINETEEN AND COMPROMISED RESPIRATORY SYSTEMS. IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE HOOKED ON CANDY FLAVORED TOBACCO PUTS THEM IN JEOPARDY NOW. AND POSSIBLY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THE TOBACCO COMPANIES KNOW THAT ALMOST ALL NEW TOBACCO USERS BEGIN THEIR ADDICTION AS KIDS. BUT THEY ALSO NOTE THAT TO NOVICE SMOKERS TOBACCO CAN BE HARSH AND UNAPPEALING AN INTERNAL TOBACCO INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT TOBACCO COMPANIES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF USING FLAVORS TO REDUCE THE HARSHNESS OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO MAKE THEM MORE APPEALING TO NEW USERS. ALMOST ALL OF WHOM ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN BY MASKING THE HARSHNESS AND SOOTHING THE IRRITATION CAUSED BY TOBACCO SMOKE FLAVORS MAKE IT EASIER FOR BEGINNERS PRIMARILY KIDS TO TRY THE PRODUCT AND ULTIMATELY ULTIMATELY BECOME ADDICTED. THE COST OF CARE FOR TOBACCO RELATED ILLNESSES TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND INSURANCE PROGRAMS IT'S ASTRONOMICAL. SIMILARLY THE MISERY CAUSED BY THE SAME ILLNESSES ALONG WITH SHORTENED LIFE EXPECTANCIES IS AN ABOMINATION. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE SMOKING AND ITS SIDE EFFECTS COST THE WORLD'S ECONOMIES MORE THAN ONE TRILLION DOLLARS AND KILL ABOUT SIX MILLION PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. THE ECONOMIC COST OF TOBACCO USE ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR TREATING TOBACCO RELATED DISEASES. AND THE LOST PRODUCTIVITY THAT RESULTS FROM TOBACCO ATTRIBUTABLE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. A STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO FOUND THAT OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE CALIFORNIA TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAM OUR PROGRAM. HAS REDUCED ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS BY AN ASTONISHING FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THIS AMOUNT ONLY INCLUDES MEDICAL CARE COSTS DOCTORS HOSPITALS DRUGS AND RELATED COSTS AND NOT INDIRECT COSTS SUCH AS LOST PRODUCTIVITY OR THE VALUE OF LIVES LOST. WERE WHO ARE THE VALUE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH DISEASE. THE SAVINGS IN THOSE AREAS OR EVEN GENERALLY EVEN MORE THAN THE DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS. LIKE PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO REDUCE TOBACCO CONSUMPTION. RESTRICTING THE SALE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS WOULD BE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC VICTORY FOR CALIFORNIA. SB SEVEN NINETY THREE WOULD SAVE AT LEAST SEVENTEEN THOUSAND LIVES AND EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN HEALTH CARE COSTS IN CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BLEMISH MCCARTY YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH COAST AND FROM SANTA MONICA OUTLINED IT'S JUST A FEW OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THE FIRST IS THIS IS NOT THE PERFECT BILLY WANTED BUT IT ADDRESSES 5% OF WHAT WE WANT AND THESE MISLEADING ADS FROM BIG TOBACCO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE WE'RE IGNORING THE INTEREST OF WHEREKIDS ARE SMOKING. THE THREE EXEMPTIONS THAT WE UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO PUT UP. KIDS REALLY AREN'T GOING TO HOOK A LOUNGE AS WE HAVE TO BE ABOVE AGE TO USE IT. FOR NOT FOCUSING ON PREMIER CIGARS AND PIPE PRODUCTS IT'S THE VAPING FLAVORED VAPING WE KNOW THAT MEANT ALL AS A GATEWAY AND SO MANY OF OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES. SO THIS IS REALLY THE FOCUS AS FAR AS HOW WE WANT TO PREVENT. YOUTH SMOKING. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE THING THAT REALLY I THINK DRIVES ME THAT THE MOST NOTS WHEN I SEE THESE CRAZY ADDS THIS IS GONNA HURT FUNDING. FOR KIDS IN OUR SCHOOLS THAT'S THIS IS THAT OUTRIGHT LIE. FIRST NUMBER ONE SCHOOLS ARE 1100% FUNDED BY PROP NINETY EIGHT. ZERO IMPACT ON DOLLARS FROM TOBACCO TAXES. THE TOBACCO TAXES THAT DO COME FOR FUN THINGS LIKE FIRST FIVE. PROGRAMS RESERVE THROUGH FIVE SOME HEALTH PROGRAMS THERE THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THEY WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS THEY'VE BEEN DECLINING IN REVENUE ON A YEARLY BASIS THEY KNOW THAT. THEIR FOR AT THEIR EXPENDITURES ARE NOT ONGOING THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE THEY'RE IN FULL CONTROL THEY'RE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU CAN DO AS FAR AS TOBACCO EDUCATION. THE OPPONENTS BIG TOBACCO THINKS KEEP THIS IN PLACE TO PROTECT KIDS. THE FOCUS ON ANTI TOBACCO EDUCATION WELL THE THING THAT'S THE MOST TO ANTI TOBACCO IS BANNING THE PRODUCT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO STOP THE KIDS FROM GETTING HOOKED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TRICKED BY. THIS THESE OUTRAGEOUS ADS WITH THE UP AN DOWN CALIFORNIA. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS KNOW THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO THIS IS THE TIME FOR THIS AND THIS IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO REALLY STEP UP AND PROTECT ARGUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY DR. ARAMBULA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINETY THREE NOT ONLY HAS A DOCTOR THAT HAS WITNESSED FIRST HAND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SMOKING BUT ALSO AS THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. MEMBERS OF MY COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THAT WE SPEND HOURS UPON HOURS LISTENING THE PASSIONATE AND HEARTFELT PLEAS FOR RESOURCES FROM HUNDREDS OF WORTHY GROUPS AND THOUSANDS OF WORTHY CAUSES. I LOVE MY COMMITTEE ON THE ISSUES WE COVER BUT IT IS HARD BECAUSE WE NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND ALL THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS TO MY SURPRISE I HAVE HEARD THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WHO USE WHAT I THINK IS A BIZARRE AND A DESPERATE CLAIM AS A REASON TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. THEY SAY YOU SHOULDN'T VOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL NOT ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH GROUPS LIKE FIRST FIVE AND OTHERS FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THE VALUABLE AND SUBSTANTIVE WORK IN THEIR COMMITTEES THEY GO ON TO SAY THAT THIS WILL PUT PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WELL FIRST LET'S BE CLEAR. BY THE FACT THAT IFTHIS BILL PASSES LESS PEOPLE WILL BECOME ADDICTED TO TOBACCO AND LESS PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME WILL SMOKE. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WILL GREATLY BENEFIT FROM THE REDUCTION IN THE ENORMOUS COST OF DEALING WITH THE HELP EFFORTS ON INDIVIDUALS WHO SMOKE. AND OUR STATE WILL ACTUALLY SAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. BUT LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE AND DELVE DEEPER INTO THE FIRST CLAIM. I AM SURE A LOT OF YOU GOT A LETTER FROM CMA FROM CDA FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN KAISER. THE PEOPLE WHO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PUTTING PROP FIFTY SIX ON THE BALLOT IN SECURING ITS PASSAGE. THESE ARE ALSO THE GROUPS THAT COME TO MY COMMITTEE ALONG WITH OTHERS AND VERY PASSIONATELY MAKE REQUEST. ON HOW TO SPEND PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY ON ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE COSTS. THEY MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IF THE RESULT OF THIS BILL IS LESS CHILDREN BECOMING ADDICTED TO SMOKING. AND THAT RESULTS IN LESS REVENUE FOR THEIR PRIORITIES THEN THE PURPOSE OF PROP FIFTY SIX IS WORKING AND THEN SUPPORTING THIS BILL IS A NO BRAINER. FIRST FIVE THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION THE CANCER ASSOCIATION THE HEART ASSOCIATION I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND FORTY DIFFERENT GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ALL OF WHICH COME BEFORE MY COMMITTEE AND ASK FOR MONEY. YET ALL OF THEM ARE SAYING WITHOUT QUESTION AND WITHOUT HESITATION THAT THE BEST THING TO DO FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND EVEN PUBLIC HEALTH CARE FUNDING IS TO PROTECT THESE KIDS. BREAK THE NASTY CYCLE OF LETTING CHILDREN BEING TARGETED BY BIG TOBACCO AND TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. IF THERE TRULY IS LESS MONEY THAN THEIR MISSION IS WORKING THE MISSION OF THESE GROUPS IS NOT TO GET MONEY FROM THE STATE. IT IS TO PREVENT MORE PEOPLE FROM SMOKING AND BETTER FUNCTIONING HELPED HAVING A BETTER FUNCTIONING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T COME TO MY COMMITTEE ASKING FOR MONEY. THE TOBACCO COMPANIES WHO ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH SO DON'T LET THEM FOOL YOU WITH THEIR ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS. THE OPPOSITION DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH AT ALL. THEY'RE DRIVING TO SAY WHATEVER THEY CAN SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO TARGET OUR KIDS. DON'T FALL FOR THAT MEMBERS IF YOU CARE ABOUT HEALTHCARE IN THE STATE ALIGN YOURSELF WITH THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING EVERY DAY TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOT THE PEOPLE WHO INFLICT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF HEALTHCARE COSTS UPON OUR CONSTITUENTS EVERYDAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR MR BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RISE IN SUPPORT AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SB SEVEN NINETY THREE AND I WANNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MORE. TROUBLING AND FRANKLY MISLEADING A FLAT OUT UNTRUE CLAIMS SOME OPPONENTS OF SB SEVEN NINETY THREE HAVE BEEN MAKING AND THAT IS THIS THAT THIS BILL CRIMINALIZES TOBACCO USE. AND WILL LEAD TO INCREASED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLEAGUES THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT IF IT WERE I WOULD NOT BE A CO AUTHOR OF SB. SEVEN NINETY. SAME WAY SIMPLY PUT SB SEVEN NINETY THREE IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM CRIMINALIZES INDIVIDUAL USE OR INDIVIDUAL POSSESSION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS WHAT THE BILL DOES DO. IS THIS IT RESTRICTS RETAIL SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS AND RETAIL POSSESSION WITH THE INTENT TO SELL. NOT INDIVIDUAL POSSESSION NOT INDIVIDUAL USE THIS BILL THIS BILL IN FACT IS SPECIFICALLY CRAFTED NOT TO CRIMINALIZE YOUTH OR COMMUNITIES. OF COLOR I WAS PROUD TO SUPPORT THE HISTORIC TOBACCO REFORMS WE ENACTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH MANY OF YOU. THOSE REFORMS REMOVED YOUTH PENALTIES FOR POSSESSION AND MADE OUR TOBACCO CONTROL LAWS MORE EQUITABLE. SB SEVEN NINETY THREE RIGHTFULLY FOCUSES ENFORCEMENT ON THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY NOT THEIR VICTIMS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING IN MY DISTRICT ARE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING ORDINANCES THAT RESTRICT FLAVORED TOBACCO SALES WITHOUT EVERY ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THESE FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS OF CRIMINALIZATION. AND IN ADDITION I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO TOUCHED ON. THAT WHILE A BAN ON FLAVORED PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE TOBACCO TAX REVENUE IN THE SHORT RUN IT WOULD ALSO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN SPECIFICALLY THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN REDUCED HEALTH CARE COSTS ANNUALLY ACCORDING TO A RECENT SOURCE. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF TOBACCO TAXES IS TO GET THAT TOBACCO TAX REVENUE TWO ZERO THAT MEANS IT'S WORKING THAT IS IT'S A DESIGN THAT IS ITS INTENT BECAUSE THAT MEANS WE HAVE DEFEATED. TOBACCO ADDICTION AND PROTECTED THE HEALTH AND LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS SO I DON'T WANT OUR OPPONENTS INCLUDING TOBACCO TRY TO SCARE YOU INTO THINKING THAT THIS BILL SOMEHOW HURTS ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES. THEY HAVE NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU THIS THAT BECAUSE OF INDUSTRY TACTICS LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THE LOT NEXT COMMUNITY THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY TOBACCO RELATED MORBIDITY AND DEATH WE CAN NO LONGER SUBSIDIZE THE HEALTHCARE COSTS OF BIG TOBACCO WE WILL NOT CRIMINALIZE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH THIS BILL FAR FROM HARMING SB SEVEN NINETY THREE WILL PROTECT. OUR COMMUNITIES FROM THE PROVEN DANGERS OF TOBACCO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EITHER COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU MR BONTA MISTER FLORA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAER MEMBERS- I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AND NOT BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY WANT TO STAND UP IN SUPPORT OF TOBACCO. BUT ACTUALLY BECAUSE I JUST THINK THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY. HYPOCRITICAL IF WE ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT KIDS. IF THIS WASN'T JUST AN IDEOLOGICAL FIGHT AGAINST BIG TOBACCO. IF WE ACTUALLY TRULY BELIEVED AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING ABOUT OUR YOUTH. THEN THERE WOULD BE NO EXEMPTIONS. WE WOULD NOT BE TAKING EXEMPTIONS FOR HOOKAH. FOR CIGARS OVER TWELVE DOLLARS. FOR OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAKE THIS BILL PASSED SIMPLY SO WE COULD GET THE VOTES AND EVEN WORSE THERE'S ANOTHER INDUSTRY THAT YOU'RE GETTING A FREE PASS. WE HAVE COMMUNITIES MY DISTRICT WHAT DISPENSARIES EVERYWHERE OUR KIDS ARE SMOKING CANNABIS. IN HELMET ALL DAY LONG. BUT BECAUSE THIS NEW COOL KID ON THE BLOCK WE LEAVE IT ALONE. AND WE GO AFTER TOBACCO. FRIENDS WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS IF WE CARE ABOUT OUR KIDS. WE MUST ADDRESS ALL OF THIS WE MUST FIGURE OUT A WAY TO KEEP US OUT OF OUR KIDS HANDS ON MY PHONE RIGHT HERE HAVE A PICTURE. OF A NERD. I GO THE LITTLE CANDIES THE NERDS CANDY A NERD WROTE. THERE'S EIGHT SERVINGS IN THIS PACKAGE. FOUR HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS OF THC IN THAT PACKAGE FIFTY MILLIGRAMS PER SERVING. AS I WOULD BE UNCONSCIOUS IF I TOOK THAT. YOU CAN'T TELL ME NO WE ARE NOT MARKETING THIS STUFF TO OUR KIDS SO I WOULD JUST ASK US AS A BODY. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A SIGNIFICANT CUT SB TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CUT. TO THE GENERAL FUND WITH THE TOBACCO TAX AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT DOCTOR YOU KNOW FRIEND FROM FRESNO IS TALKING ABOUT. AS IT RELATES TO THIS I GET IT. IT IS A BIG HIT. IN A PANDEMIC. THIS MAY NOT BE THE TIME TO DO THIS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. FRIENDS LET'S BE HONEST. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BUILDING DOES NOT LIKE BIG TOBACCO IN HOUSING FOR A LONG TIME. BUT NOT LET'S NOT HIDE BEHIND THE KIDS. BECAUSE IF WE ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT THE KIDS WE DEAL WITH ON THE OTHER INDUSTRIES AS WELL THANK YOU. THANKS FOR MS RIVAS. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SB SEVEN NINETY THREE- LIKE THE MEMBERS FROM SACRAMENTO AND FRESNO AND OTHERS HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT UP TO US THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH DISINFORMATION ON THIS BILL. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO REFOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES AND THAT IS PROTECT OUR KIDS I TRUST THE RECORD OF THE HUNDREDS OF YOUTH ADVOCATES AND PUBLIC HEALTH CHAMPIONS THAT ARE BEHIND THIS BILL I STRONGLY URGE AND I VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR OF US MISS PETRIE-NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SB SEVEN NINETY THREE. I RISE AS A MOM WHO HAS SEEN MY TWELVE YEAR OLD MY TWELVE YEAR OLD IN SEVENTH GRADE OFFERED FLAVORED VAPING PRODUCTS IN THE BATHROOM BY THE COOL KIDS. AND I ALSO RISE AS AS THE NIECE OF MY UNCLE MURPHY WHO FIRST BECAME HOOKED ON CIGARETTES WHEN HE WAS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SOLDIER IN VIETNAM AND HE BECAME A PACK A DAY SMOKER. AFTER A PAINFUL HEART WRENCHING AND ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL BATTLE WITH LUNG CANCER HE DIED TOO YOUNG AT THE AGE OF FIFTY THREE HE WAS LIKE A FATHER TO ME AND I WAS BY HIS BEDSIDE IN THE HOSPITAL AT THE TIME. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SEEN WHAT HE WENT THROUGH. MY KIDS DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT AND YOUR KIDS DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT AND ALL CALIFORNIA KIDS DESERVE A BETTER LIFE THAN NOT AND THIS BILL. IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE THAT A REALITY THIS ISN'T ABOUT NOT LIKING BIG TOBACCO ARE NOT LIKING ANYBODY ELSE. THIS IS ABOUT ELEVEN CALIFORNIA KIDS IN DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS SO I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK WAS FISHING NORRIS. IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. DR WEBER. IS TO GET RECOGNITION DR WEBER YES MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINE THREE AND I RISE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GIVEN ALL THE REASONS WHY WE SHOULD BE STANDING FOR THIS CALL US BECAUSE WE KNOW THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF TOBACCO AND MOST OF OUR LOVED ONES WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY AND I'VE HAD A LOT WHO HAVE. ALWAYS TELL ME THAT THEY BEGAN AS A KID. THEY BEGAN WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY STRUGGLED WITH THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND ACTUALLY GAVE THEIR LIFE AS A RESULT OF IT SO WE CAN SIT HERE AND PRETEND THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER ISSUES AFFECTING YOUNG PEOPLE AND IT'S ALWAYS AMAZING TO ME WITH ALL THE LEGISLATION THAT I PUT FORTH IS ALWAYS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THAT IS BEFORE US. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO REALIZE THAT YES THIS WORLD IS FILLED WITH ISSUES AND AS WE IF WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THEM WE DEAL WITH THEM ONE AT A TIME AND IT'S NOT EASY TO DEAL WITH ANY OF THESE ISSUES BUT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AS IT FACES US. AND THIS IS GROWING THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT TOBACCO WAS LOSING YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE WHY WOULD IT HAVE A CAMPAIGN ON HOW UGLY TOBACCO WAS AND HOW PEOPLE WHO LOOK AFTER THEY SMOKED AND HOW THEY LOOK WITHOUT THEIR LUNGS AND WITHOUT THEIR WITHOUT THEIR THROATS AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND SO AS A RESULT WE WOULD NOT FIND THE INDUSTRY TRYING TO ATTRACT THEM TO OTHER THINGS. YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT THE FLAVORED TOBACCO IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO YOUNG PEOPLE NOT THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY ADDICTED BUT IT PROVIDES A WAY TO DIP OF INSTANCE I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SEVEN NINE THREE. BUT I ALSO RISE AS A PERSON WHO HAS SPENT THE LAST FIFTY YEARS OF HER LIFE LEARNING AND TEACHING AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND I AM INSULTED. IN THAT THE TOBACCO. WOULD MAKE. AN EFFORT TO A BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A COUPLE. THE LATEST. IS A PART OF AFTER AMERICAN. AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEING STATED AND THAT THIS IS A DISCRIMINATORY PIECE OF LEGISLATION AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE. AND SO I'VE HAD PEOPLE CALLING ME SAYING THIS IS UNFAIR TO US IF IT'S SOMEONE WANTS TO SAVE US AND OUR CHILDREN AND FINALLY FINALLY FOCUS UPON AFRICAN AMERICANS AND YOU CONSIDER THAT DISCRIMINATORY. IN THAT CASE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO SLAVERY ECAUSE ACTUALLY WAS DISCRIMINATORY SINCE WE WERE THE ONLY ONES IN SLAVES IN THIS COUNTRY. AND YET YOU DECIDED THAT IT WAS WORTH THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD GET RID OF BECAUSE IT IS UNDESIRABLE AND IT'S THERE'S NO BENEFITS. WHEN I LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF TOBACCO IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT A CULTURALY BACKED THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT I HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT I'VE STUDIED ALL THE RESEARCH WE'VE DONE THIS AS BLACK PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN MID TO LATE A CIGARETTE AND SOMEHOW I KNOW THAT IT REPRESENTS THEIR CULTURE. IT REPRESENTS WHO THEY ARE. IT BUILDS UP THEIR VALUE SYSTEM. IT GIVES THEM AN IDENTITY AYE WE INSANE. NO THIS IS WHAT WE USED TO CALL WATERMELON POLITICS. AND IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT. THEN WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR% COMMUNITY WHEN I WAS A KID IN THE PROJECT TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SOUTH. POLITICIANS AND OTHERS WOULD COME TO OUR COMMUNITY WHAT THE WHAT WHAT I CAN FOR THE WATERMELON. AND PASS THEM OUT AND TALKING TO GET VOTES AND GET SUPPORT WATERMELON POLITICS BUT YOU NEVER SEE AGAIN. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST RACIST THING TO EVER TALK ABOUT THAT BLACK PEOPLE SOMEHOW DOUBLE LOVE MID TO LATE CIGARETTES. AND IT'S A PART OF OUR CULTURE AND IT'S GOING TO DEMONISE US IT'S GOING TO HURT OUR GRANDMOTHERS AND OLDER PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO MIDDLE LATEST. I AM. AS A SCHOLAR AS A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE AS A PERSONAL JUST REQUIRED ETHNIC STUDIES BUT EVERY CSU GRADUATE IN THE STATE. THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN ONE MINUTE TALKING ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WOULD HAVE THE AUDACITY. TO TELL ME THAT THIS IS BLACK. THAT IS WHAT BLACK ARE ABOUT. NO THIS IS WHAT RACIST ABOUT ONE OF MY A DOLLAR ON BLUE AND POOR KIDS. A YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS IS WHAT THIS ISAND WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE IT SO IF YOU THINK YOU'RE VOTING TO HELP BLACK PEOPLE. DON'T DO THAT. VOTE AGAINST A VOTE FOR THIS BILL. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A RACE ISSUE. THIS IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE THAT HAS ALWAYS HELPED PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND USE THEM FOR THE BENEFIT. SO I'M OUTRAGE AS A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSEHOLD WILL SUPPORT HIM I'LL REYES AS A SCHOLAR THAT THEY WOULD USE THIS TO TRY TO PRETEND THAT THEY ARE HELPING BLACK PEOPLE PROMOTING OUR CULTURE AND THEN USE OUR FRIENDS AND OUR MINISTERS AND OTHERS TO MAKE US BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SOME DISCRIMINATION IN THIS. I SAID IF THEY ARE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ASSIST TIME HALLELUJAH BECAUSE OF THE DISCRIMINATION. AND MAYBE WE'LL GET TO THE OTHERS LATER ON AT THE HOOKAH LOUNGES AND OTHER PLACES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED ALSO. SOMEONE ENCOURAGED YOU TO BOTH SB SEVEN NINE THREE. AS A GOOD BILL. THAT WILL BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN FROM WHAT WE SEE IS COMING. WHICH IS A HORRIBLE HABIT. THAT WOULD DEVASTATE THE LIVES AND TAKE THE BEST OF THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR WEBER. MS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE CHOICE WHETHER TO SPEAK AFTER DOCTOR WEBER I'M SORRY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO- BUT I'VE CHOSEN TO FOR VERY PERSONAL REASONS. MY MOM STARTED SMOKING WHEN SHE WAS SIXTEEN. A LOT OF YOU KNOW I LOST HER VERY EARLY SHE ENDED UP WITH BREAST CANCER AT FORTY TWO. AND THEN AFTER REMISSION IT CAME BACK AS LUNG CANCER. SHE DIED OF LUNG CANCER AT SIXTY TWO. AND THE ONLY THING SHE ASKED ME IS TO MAKE SURE MY KIDS NEVER SMOKED. IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A SIMPLE IDEA ISSUE WITH ON HER DEATH BED BE SURE MY KIDS DON'T SMOKE SMOKING IS GROSS THEY HEARD FROM EVERYBODY FROM TE TIME THAT THEY WERE BORN SHOULD BE EASY. BUT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY SAID WHEN YOU END UP HAVING AN ESPECIALLY YOUNG BOYS BUT ALL KIDS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. YOU REALIZE JUST HOW MANY KIDS ARE DOING BETH. JUST HOW AVAILABLE THESE VAPING PRODUCTS ARE AND GUESS WHAT. IT'S NOT SO GROSS IT DOESN'T SMELL SO GROSS IT DOESN'T TASTE SO GROSS. SO THE PARENT. YOU SPEND YOUR TIME TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR KID WHY SOMETHING THAT SOCIETY IS SAYING THIS IS MUCH SAFER THAN SMOKING THIS IS THIS IS NOT THE SAME. YOU TRY TO. CONVINCE THEM THAT NOW GETTING HOOKED ON NICOTINE IS THE SAME. YOU'RE SETTING YOURSELF. UP FOR A LIFETIME OF DISEASE. I WISH EVERYBODY IN THIS CHAMBER. HAD A MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. TO JUST KNOW EXACTLY HOW PREVALENT THIS IS. I DIDN'T GET THE A THE PUSH IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT THIS. BEING SOMEHOW DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS. I GOTTA PUSH ABOUT BEING DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST POOR PEOPLE. AND NOT TO IS OFFENSIVE. BECAUSE I AGREED WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE EXCEPTIONS IN THIS SHOULDN'T EXIST I THINK WE SHOULD DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE COVERING ALL TOBACCO. BUT WHAT'S DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST POOR PEOPLE IS GETTING THEM HOOKED. ON SMOKING AND NOT PROVIDING HEALTH CARE. NOT PROVIDING THE KIND OF INFORMATION THEY NEED TO ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM ESPECIALLY POOR KIDS. SO I'D BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ATTRACTING YOUNG PEOPLE TO ANY KIND OF SMOKING OR DRUGS. BUT YOU DON'T SAY NO TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY HELP TODAY IN ORDER FOR A PERFECT SOLUTION IN THE FUTURE. YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN'T. WE WILL SAVE LIVES BY PASSING THAT THAT WE KNOW. I DON'T KNOW ALL THE STATISTICS ARE THE HEALTH REASONS AND I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE PEOPLE WORK ON THIS. I JUST KNOW AS A PARENT. A. B. INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO NOT HAVE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT ARE TRACTIVE IN NOT GROSS FOR OUR CHILDREN. I THINK THIS GETS US PARTIALLY THERE. I'M PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHORS SB SEVEN NINETY THREE AND I HOPE THAT WE GET A LOT OF VOTES TODAY. THANK YOU MS GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MEMBERS MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS MEMBERS AFTER READING THE BILL IT TOOK ME ABOUT TWO SECONDS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO MORALLY- AFTER I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENTS. FROM THE OPPONENTS I FELT LIKE I WAS TWO SECONDS TOO LONG I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. EVERY PERSON IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THE DAMAGE THAT TOBACCO USE DOES TO OUR BODIES. OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IT IS CHILDREN WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO ITS DEVASTATING EFFECTS. THEY'RE GROWING BRAINS AND LUNGS CAN SUFFER LIFELONG DAMAGE. DESPITE THIS THE AVERAGE AGE OF A NEW SMOKER IS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. 90% OF SMOKERS START BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE RAISE THE SMOKING AGE TO TWENTY ONE TO HELP TO PREVENT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM BEING ADDICTED AT SUCH AN EARLY AGE. BUT OUR WORK IS NOT YET OVER. BIG TOBACCO HAS FOUND AN EVEN MORE INSIDIOUS WAY TOOK OUR KIDS. FLAVORS LIKE COTTON CANDY AND GUMMY BEARS MAKE THIS POISON TASTE LIKE CANDY. THESE FLAVORS ARE MARKETED FOR KIDS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR TO ENSURE TOBACCO COMPANIES HAVE A CLIENTELE ON THE HOOK FOR LIFE. THIS BILL PREVENTS RETAILERS FROM SELLING THE VAST MAJORITY OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS PRODUCTS WE KNOW KIDS ARE USING EVERY DAY. LET'S CONTINUE THE IMPORTANT WORK WE STARTED PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS FROM A LIFETIME OF ADDICTION AND DAMAGE SHALL I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB SEVEN NINE THREE.

MS KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I. READ THE RESENT THEM SB ONE FIFTY EIGHT WHICH IS A SIMPLE TECHNICAL CLEAN A BILL THAT CLARIFIES THAT NO PARTY. PREFERENCE VOTERS CAN BE INCLUDED ON THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. PERSONAL TO VOTER REGISTRATIONS IN THE COUNTY THE L. A. COUNTY INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING. A SIMILAR PUBLIC PROCESS AS WAS PROVIDED BY THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. THIS INCLUDES SELECTING FOURTEEN COMMISSIONERS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE POLITICAL PARTY PREFERENCES AND THE COUNTY HOWEVER NO IN P. P.'S ARE NOT CONSIDERED. HOWEVER NPP'S ARE NOT CONSIDERED A POLITICAL PARTY ALTHOUGH THEY MAKE UP ONE POINT FOUR MILLION VOTERS OR 26% OF REGISTERED VOTERS IN L. A. COUNTY. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT THE COMMISSION BE CREATED BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SO ON URGENCY CLAUSE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THIS CLARIFICATION AS CODIFIED. WITH ENOUGH TIME FOR THE COUNTY TO INCLUDE IN P. P. VOTERS IN THE COMMISSION OUR SELECTION PROCESS THIS IS A TECHNICAL BILL BUT IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THE INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION REPRESENTS. THE POLITICAL DIVERSITY OF L. A. COUNTY VOTERS THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I THINK IT WAS KAMLAGER MR GALLAGHER YOUR RECOGNIZE. YEAH WE CONSIDER THIS BILL IN THE ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE I THINK THIS IS EXHIBIT A OF WHY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE. CONTROLLING LOCALS- ELECTIONS DECISIONS THAT COUNTY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON THEIR OWN WE GOT IN THAT BUSINESS TWO YEARS AGO WE DECIDED TO CREATE THIS REDISTRICTING. COMMISSION FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND GUESS WHAT WE MESSED IT UP AND NOW WE GOT TO FIX IT BY ALLOWING. AFTER NO PARTY PREFERENCE VOTERS. TO BE ALLOWED TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION AGAIN WE SHOULD BE LEAVING THIS I'M FINE WITH SUPPORTING THIS CHANGE. BUT IT I THINK AGAIN JUST SHOWS THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS IN OUR ROLE THEY SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE COUNTIES TO DECIDE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO THE REDISTRICTING. HOW THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THEIR PROCESSES FOR THEIR LOCAL ELECTIONS- AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE AGAIN VERY THOUGHTFUL. IN HOW WE GO ABOUT POLICY IN THIS BUILDING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MS KAMLAGER YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU I. RESPECT THE COMMENTS OF- MY COLLEAGUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. WITHOUT CRITICAL OF THE ROLE. WE DESIRE TO VOTE ON MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. MY ON. PERHAPS THIS TAKES THIRTY FOUR ON THE URGENCY ALL MEMBERS VOTE. DESERVE A. ALL MEMBERS OF THE DESIRE TO VOTE. THIS KAMLAGER MOVES A CALL. THE RESERVATION WE'RE GOING TO MOVE AHEAD IN THE FILE TO FILE ITEM EIGHTY EIGHT. F. I. EIGHTY EIGHT S. B. NINE SEVENTY. CORPORATE SENATE BILL NINE SEVENTY BY SENATOR UMBERG AND OTHERS AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS. MR BERMAN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE TO PRESENT SB NINE SEVENTY JOINTLY AUTHORED BY SENATOR ON BERGEN MYSELF. AND PRINCIPALLY CO AUTHORED BY BOTH THE PRO TEM IN THE SPEAKER TO ENSURE THAT OUR GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY ELECTIONS WILL REMAIN IN JUNE. THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THIS BILL IS THE ONLY THING THE SPEAKER IN PRO TEM ARE IN AGREEMENT ON RIGHT NOW. CALIFORNIA IS TRADITIONALLY HELD ITS PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN JUNE. WITH THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS OCCURRING BECAUSE OF A DESIRE TO HAVE A GREATER SAY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATING PROCESS. THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGE THE DATE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES THEY WILL REMAIN IN MARCH. HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO MAIN REASONS TO MOVE THE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY BACK TO JUNE. IN A DECISION ISSUED LAST MONTH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT PUSHED BACK THE DEADLINE FOR THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING. TO ADOPT ASSEMBLY SENATE CONGRESSIONAL AND BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DISTRICTS FROM AUGUST FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO DECEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DECEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE DEADLINE FOR ADOPTING NEW DISTRICT LINES IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE MARCH PRIMARY ELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IN FACT UNDER CURRENT LAW CANDIDATE FILING FOR A MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO PRIMARY ELECTION WOULD END. FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE DEADLINE FOR THE REDISTRICTING COMMISSION TO ADOPT NEW DISTRICT LINES. THE OTHER REASON IS TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF THE GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION CYCLE. SINCE NINETEEN FORTY SIX WITH THE LONE EXCEPTION OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWO ELECTION. THE STATEWIDE PRIMARY ELECTION GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION YEAS HAS BEEN HELD IN JUNE. A MARCH GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY RESULT IN AN UNNECESSARILY ELONGATED ELECTION CYCLE WITH AN EIGHT MONTH GAP BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL ELECTION. MOVING THE PRIMARY TO JUNE WOULD SHORTEN THE ELECTION SEASON TO A MUCH MORE REASONABLE FIVE MONTHS. SB NINE SEVENTY IS SUPPORTED BY COMMON CAUSE THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE AND HAS ZERO OPPOSITION. THERE WAS APPROVED BY THE SENATE AS A CONSENT ITEM I THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR BERMAN. MR GALLAGHER YOUR- YES THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS IS ELECTIONS A REDISTRICTING DAY APPARENTLY- SO LOOK MEMBERS. SORRY LAST YEAR RIGHT WE VOTED. TO MAKE OUR PRIMARY BE IN MARCH. THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THAT WE HAD DONE THIS- WE DID IT BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE WAS HEY LET'S HAVE A PRIMARY MARCH TO BE RELEVANT. IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES I DIDN'T REALLY WORK THEN. AND IT DIDN'T WORK THIS LAST TIME REALLY EITHER. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I THINK OUR VOTERS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS EXPECT US TO MAKE A DECISION. AND STICK WITH IT AND BE CONSISTENT. I VOTED FOR THAT LEGISLATION. BY MISTER SPEAKER THIS MISTER SPEAKER- THAT WOULD THAT WOULD YOU KNOW CREATE THE PRIMARY MAKE IT IN MARCH AND LET'S JUST KEEP IT IN MARCH SO THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS AND VOTERS CAN GET COMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE PRIMARIES IN MARCH AND STAY WITH IT BUT IF WE KEEP MOVING BACK AND FORTH ALL WE'RE DOING IS CONFUSING VOTERS. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO WELL WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PRIMARY IN MARCH IN PRESIDENTIAL YEARS BUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN IN JUNE. IN NON PRESIDENTIAL YEARS- NONE OF THIS I THINK MAKES MUCH SENSE AT ALL WE EITHER HAVE IT IN JUNE WE HAVE IT IN MARCH. LET'S MAKE UP OUR MIND AND STICK WITH IT. I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. WE DECIDED AS A BODY TO MOVE IT TO MARCH JUST LAST YEAR. AND NOW WERE CHANGING IT AGAIN. I MEAN FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE LET'S STICK WITH SOMETHING AND STOP CHANGING ARE RULES. WITH EVERY NEW ELECTION CYCLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS GALLAGHER SEEN NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM. MR BERMAN. YOU MAY CLOSE WE WISH. THANK YOU ARE MUCH JUST TO BE CLEAR A NO VOTE WOULD MEAN THAT. THE PRIMARY THE CANDIDATE FILING FOR THE PRIMARY WOULD END FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE- DISTRICT MAPS WILL COME OUT.

YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN IS THE FIRST IN THE NATION BILL THAT REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO MANAGE SUBSIDIZED MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TO OFFER THEIR TENANTS THE OPTION OF HAVING THEIR RENT PAYMENTS REPORTED TO A MAJOR CREDIT BUREAU. THE BILL HAS A SIMPLE GOAL PROVIDE RENTERS ARE WAY TO ESTABLISH OR IMPROVE THEIR CREDIT SCORES THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF RENT. BY FOCUSING ON SUBSIDIZED HOUSING THE BILL IS TAILORED TO THOSE TENANTS LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT FROM ITS PROVISIONS. WE ALL KNOW THE NEGATIVE CREDIT ACCOUNT CONSEQUENCES WHEN PEOPLE FAIL TO PAY THEIR RENT. THERE'S NO REASON WHY TENANTS WHO REGULARLY PAY THEIR RENT SHOULDN'T RECEIVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THEIR CREDIT SCORE FOR DOING SO. ESPECIALLY NOW WHAT MANY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING ECONOMICALLY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC THIS BILL OFFERS A SIMPLE EFFECTIVE SOLUTION FOR HELPING PEOPLE IMPROVE THEIR FINANCIAL WELL BEING.
