WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER TODAY'S AGENDA BEFORE WE FORMALLY KICK OFF THIS SEVEN SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE. THIS WILL BE OUR LAST COMMITTEE UNTIL JUNE FIFTH OR WILL BE RECONVENING WITH ASSEMBLY BILLS. RAISING GERMAN THERE ARE TWO ITEMS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB TWO NINE FIVE AN ITEM.

WHERE TO START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE HERE TODAY WE'D LIKE TO GET A WELCOME CENTER GLAZER TO THE TABLE? HE'S BRINGING FOR GOOD BILL SB. TWO FOUR EIGHT WORKING HARD ON THIS ISSUE SECOND TIME AROUND. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT CENTER GLAZERS HERE TODAY. CENTER FOR END UP WELCOME SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. I THANK YOU I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND SO MANY OTHERS. YEAH THIS BILL HAS -- HAD A FULL HEARING SIDE. LAST YEAR AND IT COMES BEFORE YOU WITH TWENTY SENATE CO AUTHORS -- BIPARTISAN BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE JOINING TOGETHER TO SAY THAT I SB TWO FORTY EIGHT WOULD PROVIDE LONG OVERDUE CHANGES. TO THE RENTERS TAX CREDIT AND PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF TO TWO POINT FOUR MILLION LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME RENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE RENTERS TAX CREDIT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WAS ESTABLISHED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO BUT HAS ONLY BEEN INCREASED ONCE IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE SINCE THEN RENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TRIPLED. WHILE THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE STRIDES IN EXPANDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO PROVIDE DIRECT FINANCIAL RELIEF TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST RENTERS. THIS BILL WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATE IMPACT HELPING THOSE IN THE OIL IN THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE SKYROCKETING COSTS OF RENT. INSTEAD OF DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SINGLE AND JOINT FILERS. THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE THE CREDIT FOR THOSE WITH THE PENDANTS MAKING THE CREDIT MORE HELPFUL AND FAIR TO SINGLE MOMS DADS AND FAMILIES. FOR THIS BILL MAKES THE RENTERS TAX CREDIT REFUNDABLE SO THAT EVEN THOSE WITHOUT A TAX OBLIGATION CAN RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF THE CREDIT. ALTHOUGH OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND RANCHERS -- NOW RECEIVE LITTLE OR NO CREDIT THEY WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. UNDER THE NEW STRUCTURE SINGLE AND JOINT FILERS WITHOUT DEPENDENCE WOULD RECEIVE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS THOSE WITH DEPENDENTS WOULD RECEIVE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS. A SIGNIFICANT AND MUCH NEEDED INCREASED FROM THE SIXTY AND ONE TWENTY THAT RENTERS ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR TODAY. THE SMART PROGRESSIVE BILL COMPLIMENTS CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM GOALS TO INCREASE AND EXPAND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHILE TAKE YEARS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOMES THIS BILL WILL HELP MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS NOW. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LUIS VERANDA WITH CALIFORNIA MAY. THIRTY TWO AT A COMMITTEE THANKS FOR ALL YOUR WORK THIS YEAR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK CENTER GLAZER FOR OFFERING THIS MEASURE BRING FORWARD LONG NEEDED REFORMS ON THE RENTERS TAX CREDIT. AS THIS COMMITTEE WELL KNOWS HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S RENTERS PAY MORE THAN 50% 30% SORRY OF THEIR INCOME IN RENT NEARLY ONE IN THREE PAY 50% OF THEIR INCOME OR MORE. THESE COSTS OF A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS MANY OF WHOM STRUGGLE TO AFFORD RENT EACH MONTH. SB TWO FORTY EIGHT RETURNS THE VALUE OF THE CREDIT TO ITS EFFECTIVE VALUE WHEN IT WAS ADOPTED IN WELL WHEN I WAS A AMENDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE A COMMONSENSE ADJUSTMENT TO AN OUTDATED PROVISION OF A VERY IMPORTANT CREDIT -- IMPORTANTLY -- pACCESS TO THE RENTERS TAX CREDIT AS YOU HEARD FROM CENTER GLAZER. IT WILL NOT ONLY DOUBLE THEIR INTEREST TAX CREDIT FOR THOSE WITH CHILDREN BY ADDING NEW PROVISIONS FOR RENTERS WITH THE PENDANTS. A GROWING SEGMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION BUT WILL ALSO MAKE THE CREDIT REFUNDABLE ALLOWING THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY INCOME TAX THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO CLAIM THE CREDIT. CALIFORNIA'S SEVENTEEN MILLION RENTERS URGENTLY NEED THIS HELP. FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE THOUGH THANK YOU.

WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER BELT MISTER VICE CHAIR [inaudible] PLEASE SIR. NOT NOT MAYBE TO PROVIDE OPPOSITE OPPOSITION BUT MAYBE TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING. THE RIGHT THING WHY ARE WE MAKING IT REFUNDABLE. WELL I THINK THE THROUGH THE CHAIR -- THE GOAL IS TO HELP THOSE -- RANCHERS WHO ARE OUR MOST ECONOMICALLY. CHALLENGED AND SO WHETHER THEY HAVE A TAX LIABILITY OR THEY DON'T HAVE A TAX LIABILITY THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THOSE AT THE LOWEST END -- THE FTP IS SAYING YOU'RE PROBABLY COST ABOUT. SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- AS A TAX. THE EXPENSE AND AND AND I'M JUST CURIOUS -- THAT COULD PAY FOR A LOT OF FUN PAYMENT. WELL WE CURRENTLY PAY A LITTLE OVER 200-100-0200 MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT RENTERS TAX CREDIT -- WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL ESTIMATE ON WHAT THE COSTS WILL BE UNDER THIS -- PROPOSAL BUT IT'D BE I'D SAY IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION IS IS IT IS AN ESTIMATE -- AT CAL A CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY PROVIDES OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND TAX RELIEF TO HOMEOWNERS THAT'S UNDER OUR CURRENT TAX CODE TODAY OVER SIX BILLION. WE CURRENTLY A PROVIDING AROUND TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR RENTERS. AND YES INDEED IT WILL GO UP -- BUT CERTAINLY -- FROM AN EQUITY POINT OF VIEW IT'S IT'S STILL LOPSIDED AGAINST RANCHERS AT BUT IT'S GOING TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED AND SO I THINK IT'S JUSTIFIED AND WE DON'T CERTAINLY ANY KIND OF BONDING HAVE INTEREST RATE OBLIGATIONS THERE TOO SO. WHAT'S THAT GOING TO THOSE EQUATIONS OR MAYBE TO TALK ABOUT THE JOBS ACT -- IN THE JOBSOR THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT WHICH WHICH BROUGHT IN SALT THE STATE LOCAL TAX. DON'T YOU THINK THAT MIND OF KINDA GIVEN. RENTERS A LITTLE EVEN MORE OF AN EVEN BREAK COMPARED TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL ME I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE THE RESEARCH YOU JUST SITED MIGHT BE A LITTLE OUT DATED BECAUSE OF THE NEW BILL. I I DON'T I DON'T THINK ANYTHING NEW EITHER BECAUSE THEY JUST THIS IS OUR FIRST YEAR. BUT I'M I'M JUST WONDERING. IF IF MAYBE THINGS HAVE KIND OF EVEN UP A LITTLE BIT OF ALL YOU CAN DEDUCT THIS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY GETTING A MASSIVE TAX BREAK FOR OWNING A HOME NOW. WELL THE THE NUMBERS THAT I I PROVIDED IN REGARD TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I TAX BENEFITS ARE DON'T RELATE TO FEDERAL -- TAX LAWS IT RELATES TO HOW WE TREAT -- HOW HOW WE TREATED AT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE THOSE ARE -- OLDER NUMBERS I I HAVE TO RECHECK IT BASED ON NOW -- THE THE FEDERAL RULES AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THAT TAX CREDIT THAT THAT WE PROVIDE IN THE STATE. BUT IT'S A LOPSIDED. I IT'S IT'S A MASSIVELY LOPSIDED TODAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD THAT THAT YEAH HOW MUCH IT WOULD -- STRAIGHT OUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT SOMEHOW IT MIGHT BE EVEN BUT I THINK OF YOUR SUGGESTION IS THERE COULD BE MORE UPDATED NUMBERS -- I THINK THAT'S A GOOD ONE AND I'D BE HAPPY TO CHECK ON THAT. WITH THAT I KNOW I GUESS ONE OF MY LAST QUESTIONS WOULD BE THEN. INSTEAD OF JUMPING THREEFOLD MAYBE WE'D BE PHASED IN OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. YEAH I THINK THAT'S AN OPTION -- IN THE IN THE IN THE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR I PROPOSED A FIVE YEAR PHASE IN -- AND AT AT THE START OF THIS BILL THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY HEARING I'M COMING BACK AND SAYING IF WE STARTED ALL AT ONCE HERE'S THE BENEFITS THAT WOULD COME FOM IT -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- AS AT IT THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY AND GOES FORWARD THROUGH THE SENATE. THE DOES THE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE LIKELY TO OCCUR -- AS IT MOVES FORWARD IN TERMS OF WHAT COULD WE AFFORD TODAY THERE ARE OFF FRANCE WITHIN THIS LEGISLATION. THE GOVERNOR TO BECAUSE CALL PAUSE -- BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC AID ISSUES SO THAT'S THIRTY BILL TEN BUT I'M I'M OPEN MINDED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE MAKE IT AFFORDABLE WITHIN OUR BUDGET FRAMEWORK. BUT ALSO -- ACCELERATES OUR COMMITMENT TO HELPING OUR POOREST RENTERS [inaudible] WROTE. TODAY WE HAVE A LOT OF BILLS WERE WERE DISCUSSING TAX CREDITS EVEN THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY OF RESEARCHING. WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING SO I'M? I'M I'M SITTING HERE TRYING TO FIGHT. THIS YOU KNOW I SHOULD BE ANTI TAX. PHILOSOPHICALLY WITH HOW DO I PAY FOR PENSIONS AND RETIREE MEDICAL AND IT'S IT'S IT'S MAY FIRST AND THE STATE HASN'T RELEASED ITS. AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR JUNE THIRTIETH [inaudible] TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND I HAVE THIS FUNNY FEELING WHEN WE GET THE NEWS IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY. AWFUL IF YOU ADD NINETY ONE AND A HALF BILLION OF RETIREE MEDICAL. TO OUR UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT THAT'LL PUT AS UNDER WATER QUARTER TRILLION DOLLARS ON OUR BALANCE SHEETS I'M. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I BALANCE TRYING. TO FIX A BALANCE SHEET WITH YOU KNOW GIVING TAX CREDITS. AS AS WONDERFUL AND IS. YOU KNOW AS MUCH SENSE AS THEY MAKE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT SO I GUESS MISTER CHAIR THAT THE QUESTION BE THAT THIS WOULD OBVIOUSLY GO TO APPROACH NEXT. RIGHT AND IN DOES APPROACH USED THE LA OVER HOW TO YOU KNOW WHO'S WHO IS RIGHT NOW LOOKING OVER. HOW IT ALL FITS IN HOW WE PREPARE? OUR BUDGET I'VE. YEAH I KNOW I IN I THINK THE VICE CHAIR -- BRINGS UP A POINT OF LOOK. WE MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS IT WILL BE CONSULTING WITH. THE PREPARATIONS CHAIR -- A AND HIS VERY CAPABLE STAFF ON THIS ISSUE. I KNOW THAT DEPARTMENTS FROM THE MINISTRATION -- IN ALL THROUGHOUT STATE GOVERNMENT WILL BE -- CONSULTING -- AND OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE. HAS FULL AUTHORITY OVER BUDGET -- AND AT TIMES THERE MAY BE DISAGREEMENTS ON HOW TO APPROACH BUDGET DEPENDING ON WHAT SIDE YOU MAY BE ON AND I THINK ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. ESPECIALLY WITH THE CRISIS THAT WE FACE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN THE LOW IN VERY LOW CATEGORIES -- IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE VERY MODERN VERY MODERATE INDIVIDUAL TAX CREDIT. TO A POPULATION CURRENTLY DOESN'T SEE A LOT. OF POSITIVES FROM THIS CURRENT ECONOMY. JUST MY OWN PERSONAL PAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS THANK. THANK YOU SO MUCH SERVICE YOU'RE ALWAYS GRATEFUL FOR THE COMMENTS. WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OUR CONVERSATION FROM COMMITTEE WE DO A MOTION. BY CENTER ABOUT CENTER BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THIS SO I THINK -- THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE BETWEEN -- MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION AND RENTERS TAX CREDIT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MAY LIEU OF OF THE PUBLIC AND AND LOOK AT THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I THINK. WHEN YOU LOOK AT --MORTGAGE INTEREST. DEDUCTION. WHICH IS GONE UP WITH THE INCREASE IN VALUE OF PROPERTY. OF IN THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY I THINK THAT'S OF NOT BEEN BALANCED BY. INCREASES IN THE RENTER -- TAX CREDIT SO IT'S KIND OF A I THINK WE OUGHTA APPROACHES FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT ON A LITTLE BIT OF MISTER CHAIRMAN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. TRADING A PROPER BALANCE IF YOU WANT TO SET THAT WAY. AND NOT -- DISCRIMINATE AGAINST RENTERS AND RIGHT NOW THE RENTERS. HAVE NOT RECEIVED -- THE TAX. OF CREDIT -- FOR AWHILE. SO IT'S LIKE KIND OF LIKE AN OVERDUE THING IN MY OPINION. AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE WORKED OUT IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE -- I WOULD ALSO SAY. THAT I URGE RESTRAINT ON CONSIDERATION OF OPTIONS LIKE. BONDS -- I KNOW THERE IS A EXCELLENT ARGUMENTS AGAINST BONDS. THAT WAS -- WRITTEN. AND I REFER THE CENTER FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO IT THAT WAS WRITTEN. OPPOSING OUR PROPOSITION ONE LAST YEAR. EXCELLENT WRITTEN TREATISE AGAINST BONDING AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION ONE LAST YEAR. I SUGGEST THAT -- WE RESTRAIN OURSELVES ON BONDS USING THAT. WONDERFUL A TREATISE -- TO GUIDE US IN OUR DISCUSSION OF BONDS. SO I HAD AND I WORK FOR HIM TO THAT. ARTICLE THAT WAS WRITTEN -- IN THE BALLOT STATEMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MISTER VICE CHAIR. MR. I BELIEVE EIGHT YOU YOU MIGHT BE REFERRING TO PROP SIXTY EIGHT OF JUNE. OF LAST YEAR NOT PROP. ONE YEAH A QUICK BUT I WROTE A THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT BACK IN IN JUNE OF LAST YEAR. WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE FINANCES AND THE REASON I BRING IT UP LOOK AT BOTH OF THEM. OKAY -- IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THE THE THESE BONDS ARE ARE PURSUING RIGHTEOUS CAUSES WELL BUT THEY'RE COSTING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. AND SO THAT'S WHY I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT -- THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN IT. IN LAS REVENUE PLUS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND IN A BOND PAYMENTS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE TALKING REAL DOLLARS SO THAT'S WHY I BRING IT UP IN. AND SINCE THE CENTER GLAZER IS FAMILIAR WITH A GOOD BOND. OPPORTUNITY THAT HE'S PURSUING I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE FROM THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL -- AS YOU AND I ARE ON THE BUDGET. TRYING TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS. WE HAVE A GOOD GAME MAKING HIM A PING PONG GOING LASER JAMMER AND TURN IT BACK OVER TO CENTER ABOUT PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK IF WE HAVE. A A STABLE FINANCIAL SOURCE FOR ON GOING ON FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHICH THIS COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED -- WITH SOME NEGATIVE VOTES -- I THINK IF WE PASSED. ONGOING STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- WE WENT NEED TO HAVE A BONDING AND WE WOULD USE A 100% OF THE MONEY. FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AND THAT'S ANOTHER AVENUE WE SHOULD PURSUE AS IN ADDITION TO THE RATHER START. IT'S ALL PART OF A PACKAGE -- I THINK LAND USE REFORM CENTER WINNER HAS HIS BILL -- WE HAVE THE TENNIS RIGHTS BILL -- THIS BILL AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- FINANCING I THINK IT'S ALL PART OF A LARGER. EFFORT TO OF ATTEMPT TO TEACH TO TAKE ON THE MAJOR CHALLENGE WE HAVE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH THE SENATE'S WORKING HARD ON THIS WE ARE TO TO THE WORKING SUPPORT THIS BILL AS WELL AS THE OTHERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE FROM THE COMMITTEE. MAKE SOME QUICK CLOSING COMMENTS -- IN SAY THAT WE HAVE NO SILVER BULLET. IT IS GOING TO TAKE MATT MULTIPLE TOOLS IN OUR BELT TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT THIS CRISIS. I THE RENTERS TAX CREDIT IS ONE OF THEM. AND CENTER BELL IS SHOWN. TIRELESS LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SENATE BILL FIVE IS ANOTHER -- AND IF WE ARE GOING TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. TAX CREDITS FOR MULTINATIONAL BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS IN MEASURES HELD SHOULD E FOCUSED ON TAX CREDITS FOR THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS.

AND ITEMS -- TWO FIFTY TWO AM CENTER THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS -- YOU ARE CORRECT MISTER CHAIR THIS HAS BECOME A PASSION OF MINE I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I GOT HERE BECAME THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MOBILE. AND MANUFACTURED HOMES HOW MUCH I WOULD CARE ABOUT MOBILE HOME PARKS AND THE RESIDENTS WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE EACH OF YOU KNOWS HOW MANY MOBILE HOME PARKS YOU HAVE IN YOUR DISTRICT. THIRTEEN REQUIRE YOU ARE OUR WINNER WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE PARKS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN SPACES. THIRD MORLOCK I SHARE WITH YOU YESTERDAY IN CASE YOU FORGOT SIXTY SIX NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT CENTER BELT FORTY SIX WITH. EARNED SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN SPACES. SENATOR NIELSEN THREE HUNDRED AND THREE PARKS WITH EIGHTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR SPACES. AND SCOTT WENER BRINGING UP THE REAR WITH ONLY FOR PARKS AND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE SPACES BUT ALL OF THOSE RESIDENTS APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING TO HELP THEM. UP FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. SB TWO FIFTY TWO WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR PRIVATE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS TO SELL THEIR PARK TO THEIR RESIDENTS A NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ENTITY OR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS WE'RE ALL AWARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE EXPERIENCING A SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS DUE TO LACK OF ALL LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SINCE MOBILE HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOMES ARE IMPORTANT OPTION IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST STRIVE TO PRESERVE THE AVAILABLE MOBILE HOMES PARKS STOCK. SOME NONPROFIT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARTNERS ARE INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PURCHASING PARKS FROM LONG STANDING BUSINESS OWNERS. THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS WHEN PARK OWNERS DECIDE TO RETIRE. AND LEAD THE INDUSTRY AND SELL THEIR PARKS WHEN THIS OCCURS RESIDENTS FACE STEEP RENT INCREASES OR DISPLACEMENT WITH FEW OPTIONS OF WHERE TO MOVE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A DEDICATION OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO THE PARK OWNER WHO MAY WISH TO LEAVE THE BUSINESS AND NOT WANT TO DISPLACE RESIDENTS. WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THE PARK OWNER WOULD BE ELIGIBLE EXCLUSION THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM FOR THE PARK OWNERS AND NOT A FORCED SALE. MEMBERS SB TWO FIFTY TWO HELPS PROTECT THIS LIMITED STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND KEEPS LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND SENIORS OFF THE STREETS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'VE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ALICIA SEBASTIAN. OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RURAL HOUSING SPONSOR AND REPRESENTS MANY OF OUR NONPROFIT HOUSING ENTITIES.

SO MY TO LEASES THE VAST AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR REAL HOUSING. THING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION OUR MEMBERS ARE PREDOMINANTLY NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS SERVING RURAL FARM WORKER AND AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES BY PULL THE MICROPHONE A LITTLE CLOSER. SORRY ABOUT THAT NO WORRIES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND MOBILE HOME SPACES HAVE DISAPPEARED WITH THE RECOVERY OF THE HOUSING MARKET THESE COMMUNITIES ARE BEING MARKED BY OWNERS AND INVESTORS FOR ACQUISITION AND CONVERSION TO OTHER USES. WHEN THIS HAPPENS RESIDENTS CANNOT EASILY MOVE IN FACT OVER HOMES WILL NEVER BEBE LOCATED? AS SUCH RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS ALIKE LOSE THEIR HOMES IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT-THE COUNTRY WE HEAR SO OFTEN THAT ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES FACING NONPROFIT RESIDENT AND PUBLIC HOUSING ENTITIES. FROM SUCCESSFULLY PURCHASING AND PRESERVING A PARK IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. PARK SALES CAN HAPPEN SO QUICKLY AMONGST BROKERS AND INVESTORS INTERESTED BUYERS NEVER HAVE THE CHANCE. THIS BILL CREATES AN INCENTIVE THAT HELPS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND GIVES LEVERAGE FOR MISSION DRIVEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESERVATION ORGANIZATIONS. THIS IS JUST ONE TOOL IN THE PARK PRESERVATION TOOL KIT BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. IN FACING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS SB TWO FIFTY TWO WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO MAKE THE MOST OF EXISTING RESOURCES. TO PROTECT THE HOUSING WE ALREADY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SEBASTIAN TAYLOR FLORA GEORGE OF TWO MINUTES AND WELCOME TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS SUZANNE TAYLOR AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO FIFTY TWO I AM THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ACOSTA COMMUNITIES A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATION THAT I FOUND A TWENTY YEARS AGO. I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF A CG A MANUFACTURED CONSULTANT. SPECIALIZING IN MANUFACTURED HOUSING IN PROVIDING SERVICES THE GOVERNMENT NONPROFIT AND INVESTORS SO I HAVE A BROAD POINT OF VIEW. ARE NONPROFIT OWNS OR OPERATES EIGHT COMMUNITIES HOUSING TWELVE HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS AND FORTY ONE HUNDRED RESIDENTS WITHIN THE COUNTIES OF INTEREST AMBER DINO ORANGE AND TULARE. WHERE WE PROVIDE LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO NON PROFITS IN THE REDEVELOPMENT YEARS THE RATE OF NONPROFIT PURCHASES HAS SLOWED TO NEW ONLY A HALT? WE'RE LOSING GROUND TO NONTRADITIONAL HEDGE FUND GROUPS THAT HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE BUSINESS PLANS CAN FIND INFRASTRUCTURE IN HOME REPLACEMENTS AND HAVE ACCESS TO BETTER POSITION FINANCING. THEY HAVE A LONG REGION OF THIS MARKET NOW. THEY **** PROPERTIES QUICKLY IN CLOSE IN THIRTY DAYS DESPITE AN ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR PROJECTS DAY BY DAY THE LAST PURCHASE A GUST OF WIND MADE WAS THREE YEARS AGO. THIS PAST YEAR WE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PARKS OF INTEREST THAT WOULD WE COULD FINANCE SOMEONE OPERATE WITHIN OUR MISSIONS IN EACH CASE WITHIN ONE WEEK. OF GOING TO MARKET THESE PROPERTIES WERE SOLD TO INVESTMENT GROUPS. AB TWO FIFTY TWO WILL GIVE A NEW TOOL TO CATCH THE EYE OF THESE BY OF OF THE BUYERS WHO ARE OTHERWISE HAVE NO INTEREST IN SELLING TO A PARTY. AND THAT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT -- MISSIONS IN PROTRACTED CLOSING SCHEDULES LIKE A BLACK CAR NONPROFITS THE INCENTIVE WOULD LET SOME OF THESE SELLERS WHO WANT TO RETIRE FROM THE BUSINESS OR WANT TO CASH OUT. YOU MAY WANT TO CLOSER PARK OR ATTEMPT TO CLOSE FOR ANOTHER USE. IT OR AT THAT ARE NOT INTERESTED OR DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED UNDER EACH CD REGULATIONS. THERE IS A LIMIT TO PULL OF SELLERS IN THIS -- MARKET HE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM SO THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT BE COSTLY TO THE STATE. OVERALL. IN A GOOD YEAR MAYBE ONE OR TWO AND A FOR LUCKY THREE PUT PARKS ARE SOLD TO NON PROFITS PER YEAR -- THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY BIG DIP IN WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. OKAY WITH THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAM WE MIGHT GET TO FIVE AND THAT WOULD PROVIDE TWELVE HUNDRED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. FOR A LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS THANK YOU.

THANK YOU I'M READY JUDGE COLEY I'M PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. OUR ASSOCIATION HAS TWO GOALS JOB CREATION AND GROW THE ECONOMY. PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO US. AND THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE BUT CURRENTLY ONLY 17% OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE ARE INCORPORATED. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING ON NEW TAX RULES I WAS TOLD BY THE US CHAMBER SMALL BUSINESS. TAX ADVISER. THAT ONLY S. AND C. CORPORATIONS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO COUNT BUSINESS EXPENSES SO THIS IS A PROACTIVE BILL. THIS IS A BILL TO BRING BOARD MORE TAX REVENUE TO THE STATE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO INCORPORATE MORE THAN 17%. IT'S A FAIR BILL BECAUSE OF MICRO BUSINESS SHOULDN'T PAY FOR IT GOOGLE AND CHEVRON QUE. IT IS BOB. DEFINITELY THERE IF YOU DO THE ARITHMETIC AND WE'RE GOING TO BE PROACTIVE IN THIS IT ALSO WILL MEAN THAT SMALL BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE THE RISK THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE FOR LIABILITY.

THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING IT. I BELIEVE CHAU. SO HERE'S A CHART IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS. BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A AND GET THE TAXI METERS FOR MINIMUM TAX YOU PAY MORE. IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD TAXABLE INCOME SO THIS IS. SORT OF HELPING CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE. MAYBE SEVEN THOUSAND TAXABLE INCOME OR LESS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD TWO POINT SIX MILLION OR WHATEVER. IN IN IN REVENUES. YEAH BETTY JO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT YOUR MIND IS RE INTRODUCING YOURSELF TO COMMITTEE PLEASE I'M BETTY JO TO CALL A FROM CONFERENCE SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. WHAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TELL ME? IS THAT THE REASON THEY DON'T INCORPORATED IS BECAUSE OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THAT IF PARTICULARLY IN YEARS THAT THEY DON'T MAKE A PROFIT THAT IS A REAL HARDSHIP FOR THEM. BUT THERE ALSO IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE YOU ARE RIGHT ON THE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS -- BUT THERE IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE THAT. BASED ON REVENUE A MICRO BUSINESS SHOULDN'T REALLY PAVE WHAT A BUSINESS LIKE MINE PAYS. OF THAT HAS. THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE. AND CERTAINLY THE BIG BOYS. FRANK I'M TAKE BELGIUM TECHNO PER MILE PRACTICE DAYS IS A CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT Là AB THAT'S RIGHT I'VE GOT THAT ABOUT YOU. SO YEAH THE EIGHT HUNDRED MINIMUM. TAXES AS ONEROUS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE USING CORPORATIONS FOR A LOT OF TAX PLANNING OR OTHER. TECHNIQUES BUT NOT HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH VOLUME. BUT BUT DOING THE MATH I'M JUST YOU KNOW YOU YOU WOULD GET. AT A 50% CUT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A A TAX LOSS THE GET THE BENEFIT. IT MIGHT HAVE A GOOD YEAR IN SALES BUT YOU HAD A YOU KNOW HI YEAR OF EXPENSES SO IT. I'M JUST TRYING. TO WHAT IS. IT SHOW YOU MY ARITHMETIC CON. IF CURRENTLY OF LET'S TAKE FOR THERE'S SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES WITH EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA. AS OF TWENTY TWELVE AND LET'S TAKE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IF YOU TAKE THAT 20% OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD PAY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. 20% WOULD PAY OFF FOUR HUNDRED AND 40% WOULD PAY TWO HUNDRED THE REVENUE IS GREATLY INCREASE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY CURRENTLY ARE PAYING NOTHING I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION FROM THE FROM THE ACCOUNTANTS PERSPECTIVE. HOW THEY WOULD HAVE THIS WOULD APPLY TO THIS IN THAT SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE? RIGHT IF YOU IF IF YOU'RE TWO PARENTS SIX MILLION IN REVENUES. BUT YOU HAD A MILLION IN TAXABLE INCOME YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA PAY UP YOU'RE GONNA PAY THE 9% OR WHATEVER THE RADIUS. SO THE EIGHT HUNDRED IS IS IS THE MATERIAL. SO I GUESS WE THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH AYE. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE WIPING OUT THIS MINIMUM TAX IN I I I DON'T KNOW HOW IT THIS BILL REALLY DOES THAT I'LL VOTE FOR THE BILL BUT BUT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF. YOU BENEFIT ONLY IF YOU HAVE. A TAX LOSS THAT YEAR. QUESTION WOULD BE DO YOU STILL GET THE KERRY BACK TO LOS. FOR ALSO INCENTIVIZING INCORPORATION I MEAN THERE THERE THERE'S MULTIPLE FACETS TO WHY THIS BILL FIRST WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT THE MINIMUM TAX. OF FAIR APPLICATION OF IT AND WE'RE TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE INCORPORATIONS AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO HIT THE SWEET SPOT. AND YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW. TO GET A BIPARTISAN BILL ON TAXES IS TO THE VERY NARROW SWEET SPOT. OUR LORD WERE TRYING TO GET THERE I GOT A SMIRK FROM LOOKING SOMETHING SOONER PORTANTINO BECAUSE WE WOULD LOVE TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT BUT IF YOU WANTED TO OFFER THAT YOU KNOW. THE CALL TO LIKE YOUR I WILL TAKE YOUR AYE VOTE AND AND MOVE IT ON BUT I I BUT I I I'M I'M JUST THINKING A PRACTICE IT IT'S IT'S NOT GOING. TO BE WHAT WE WILL. REALLY NEED IS JUST GONNA BE WITH YOU HAD A TAXABLE AUSTIN YOU YOU JUST SAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS AND THAT'S NOT THE BANG I'M LOOKING FORWARD SO I APOLOGIZE. FOR BEING A CPA ARE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO NEVER VOTE IS ELECTED IT REAL QUICK SO I'D LIKE TO BRING CLOSURE TO THIS. DISCUSSION HERE SO -- MA'AM IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST RESPOND BRIEFLY PLEASE. THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX IS EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LOSS. IF IN REVENUES YOU KNOW FOR THE YEAR SO IT'S THE BASE. YOU STILL PAY TAXES ON ON YOUR GROSS EARNINGS. IN ADDITION SO I DON'T THINK YOU LOSE ANYTHING BECAUSE CURRENTLY THEY'RE NOT PAYING ANYTHING. ARE YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR EIGHT HUNDRED EVERY YEAR REGARDLESS BUT ONLY 17% A SMALL BUSINESSES ARE INCORPORATED IN PAYING. AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS AT LEAST 50%. ART. BUT I'M SAYING THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A BIG SAVINGS UNDER THIS. FORMULA AS I UNDERSTAND IT. AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I SUPERCHARGE YOUR BILL. TO GET CLOSER TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND I'LL STOP THERE MISTER NO. LOOK AT FIRST FIVE I AM SO GRATEFUL TO THE VICE CHAIR -- WITH HIS PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND BRINGING THAT PERSPECTIVE COMMITTEE IT IS HELPED US -- AN AMAZING MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

LIKE WORKERS COMPENSATION AUTO COVERAGE TOWARD IN GENERAL LIABILITIES. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN OUR MEMBERS MAY HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR PRIMARY AGENCY FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BOARD MEETING WHICH WOULD CREATE A CONFLICT FOR ALL OF THEIR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS.

THERE'S AN AYE WIENER WIENER I FIND THAT CURRENTLY ENJOYS A FIVE ZERO VOTE WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CENTER WAS ACCOUNTS BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AS WELL SIR. THANK YOU. THE GERMAN ARMY MOVING ON TO ITEM THIRTEEN THIS IS THE LAST ITEM ON THE PORTANTINO SHOW TODAY THIS IS SB FIVE TWENTY ONE WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING FOR A FULL PRESENTATION ON THIS ITEM. CENTER PORTANTINO IN YOUR LAST BILL THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS PRESENTED BY THE COMMITTEE IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH MY OFFICE TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB FIVE TWENTY ONE WHICH WOULD ALLOW A TAX CREDIT. TO TAXPAYER THAT OWNS A PROPERTY RENTED TO OR AT LEAST BY PERSONS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER SECTION EIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSING ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN HOUSING PROVIDE AS HOUSING PROVIDERS -- PRIVATE MARKET LANDLORDS WHO RENT TO SECTION EIGHT TENANTS ARE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF CRITICAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS TO QUALIFIED FAMILIES IN NEED HOWEVER DATA FROM THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. IN A CASE THAT THE NUMBER OF LANDLORDS ACCEPTING VOUCHERS HAS DECLINED OVER THE PAST DECADE. WHILE THE NUMBER OF VOUCHERS UTILIZED HAS INCREASED ADDITIONALLY HOUSING CHOICES OF SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER HOLDERS ARE SEVERELY CONSTRAINED IN FINDING A UNIT. THAT MEETS THE PROGRAMS RENTAL LIMITS FOR THOSE LANDLORDS WITH UNITS THAT WOULD RAN ABOVE SECTION EIGHT LIMITS. PARTICIPATING IN THE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER PROGRAM IS A DISADVANTAGE AND RESULT IN RECEIVING A LOWER MONTHLY RENT. THAN ONE COULD RECEIVE ON THE OPEN MARKET. FOR THE VOUCHER PROGRAM TO BE REALIZE ITS FULL POTENTIAL IN PROVIDING ASSISTED HOUSE HOLD ACCESS TO SAFE AND DECENT HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS. OF THEIR CHOOSING THE PROGRAM MUST APPEAL TO ARRIVE A WIDER VARIETY OF LANDLORDS FOR VOUCHERS TO BE APPEALING TO PRIVATE MARKET PROPERTY OWNERS. THEY MUST BE OFFERED A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE THAT LOAN LARGE VALUE IN LIEU OF CHANGING MARKET RATE RENTS. RAISING HOUSING COSTS CONTINUE TO AFFECT NEARLY ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES SO BY INCENTIVIZING LANDLORDS TO RID RENT SECTION EIGHT RECIPIENTS LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE MORE LIKELY. TO NOT BE PRICED OUT OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AS RAINS CONTINUE I KNOW -- CERTAINLY THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING ISSUES IN GENERAL ARE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS JUST CREATE ONE MORE INCENTIVE. FOR THE PRIVATE MARKET TO TO TAKE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS I MEAN -- IT'S SORT OF TELLING THAT OF WORK CREATING MORE OR THE THE MARKET HAS MORE PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY FOR SECTION. EIGHT BUT LESS OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THOSE VOUCHERS THAT'S NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND SO WE CAN CREATE A TAX BASE INCENTIVE TO CREATE MORE. PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO WOULD TAKE IN SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS -- BY MAKING THE ECONOMICS BETTER. WE THINK IT'S A GOOD INCENTIVE -- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE SOLUTION IN TOTAL BUT WE THINK IT'S A GOOD PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WITH ME. I A PETERS -- BACK FROM THE CITY OF GLENDALE WHICH FRANKLY I HAVE TO SAY IS ONE OF THE THE BEST EXAMPLES OF A CITY -- DOING WHAT IT CAN TO HELP PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING EARLIER IN THE YEAR YOU KNOW THAT COMMITTEE HEARD. THE PROPOSAL TO USE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A BOND FUNDS DIRECTLY 4100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HERE'S GLENDALE BACK AGAIN. WHICH HAS A LARGE APARTMENT -- MARKET PLACE TRYING TO HELP THERE -- LANDLORDS -- PLACE MORE FOLKS IN SECTION EIGHT HOUSING SO MISTERS -- BACK IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND FOURTEEN I JUST WANNA CONFIRM TO WHEN YOU'RE TAKING A MINUTE I AM THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS A BACK WELCOME BUT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE SIR YOU HAVE THE FLOOR TWO MINUTES THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING -- MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS ITEM BEFORE YOU. THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FOR HIS -- BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND TOWARDS HIS DEDICATION FOUR DEDICATION AFFORDABLE HOUSING EFFORTS -- IN HIS DISTRICT HE'S OUT AT EVERY EVENT THAT WE HAVE AND SUPPORTING US IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE -- I JUST LIKE THAT FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN IN ADMINISTERING A SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM. JUST ADD THIS THIS -- TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY -- THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM AND LIKE MANY PROGRAMS NEARLY ALL OF THEM CALIFORNIA -- THE WAITING LIST FOR THAT PROGRAM THEY'RE CLOSED HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR QUITE SOME TIME. GLENDALE A WEIGHTLESS PROGRAM HAS BEEN CLOSED SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE AT THAT TIME THAT WE OPENED WE HAD OVER TWELVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS APPLY. HERE WE ARE SOME EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER WE STILL HAVE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ON THE WAITING LIST WAITING FOR THEIR VOUCHER. IT'S VERY DISHEARTENING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS -- RANGE OF EMOTIONS WERE WE FINALLY PULL SOMEONE OFF THE WAITING LIST AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS ISSUE THEM ABOUT YOUR SEE THEM GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. COME BACK SIX MONTHS LATER WHICH IS THE MAXIMUM TIME LIMIT HOW. HAD GIVES YOU TO BE ABLE TO CONTRACT UP UNIT AND SAY I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A UNIT I WAITED EIGHTEEN YEARS. NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONTRACT AND HAVE THE TURN THAT BELCHER BACK OVER TO YOU. WE THINK THIS BILL WILL. HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE HELP BRIDGE THAT GAP THAT A LOT OF LANGUAGE ARE LOOKING AT THE LOOKING AT THAT FINANCIAL DELTA. SO THANK YOU. WELCOME BACK MISTER CHAIRMAN DAVID JONES ALSO ABOUT FOR GLENDALE BUT ALSO ON BEHALF THE CITY PASADENA. CITY PASADENA RUNS THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM THEY HAVE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED LANDLORD TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ONE HUNDRED OF THE LANDLORDS HAVE DECLINED TO CONTINUE THAT OPERATION AND WE THINK THAT THIS PROVIDES THE IMPORTANT SOLUTION TO INCENTIVIZE LANDLORDS TO CONTINUE TO BE IN THE PROGRAM AND AND AS PETER HAS MENTIONED -- PEOPLE WITH VOUCHERS NOT BE ABLE TO FIND A LANDLORD WILLING TO TAKE THESE VOUCHERS WE THINK THIS BILL WILL WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF LANDLORDS TO SAY YES THIS MAKES FINANCIAL SENSE FOR ME TO RENT TO A VERY LOW INCOME PERSON. SO AS FAR AS THE DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS IN PASADENA ARE VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE WE NEED THESE PEOPLE TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITY KEEP THE DIVERSITY THERE WE'D ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TO SENATE TESTIMONY WE NOW LIKE TO WELCOME ANYONE WHO IS IN SUPPORT OF PLEASE COME FOR FIRST AND LAST AS WELL AS ORGANIZATION.

SET UP LIKE WE HAVE A HOUSING BONDS AND SO FORTH AND WE SET UP THESE. VOUCHER PROGRAMS THEIR NON FEDERALLY FUNDED. WITH THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE TAX CREDIT. OR COULD THEY BE I MEAN WHEN WE WE SET UP A LIKE A COUNTY TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. OF FOR AFFORDABLE IT BE THE SAME. IT BE LIKE A SECTION EIGHT LIGHT. TAX -- VOUCHER A VOUCHER PROGRAM SECTION EIGHT LIKE VOUCHER PROGRAM FOR LIKE HOME WAS -- FOR PROGRAMS -- FOR OUT REASSURE VETERANS ARE SO FORCES AND IT'S NOT A SECTION H. BUT IT'S LIKE A SECTION EIGHT RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED IT'S JUST THE FEDERAL. SECTION -- EIGHT BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN LOOK AT EXPANDING IT TO YEAH LOCALS OBVIOUSLY THE COST. COMES INTO YOU KNOW HOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THE TAX CREDIT WOULD BE AT THAT POINT BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN LOOK AT IT BUT TO BE TO ANSWER QUESTION RIGHT NOW THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS ARE NOT INCLUDED. OKAY SO WE ARE IT COULD BE A THE STATE PROGRAM IN A RATHER THAT OF STATE VOUCHER. PROGRAM OF WE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR THEY ACTUALLY THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT BUT I THINK I THINK THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. MAYBE A WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND CERTAINLY LAUDABLE PROGRAMS -- THEN YOU'RE RIGHT MANY COUNTIES ARE DOING OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN JUST THE FEDERAL PROGRAM.

HAVE DONE AT A NUMBER OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA DO IT AS OVER -- TO TO DO IT HERE ON THE ONE OF THE ARE ONE OF THE KEYS THE FEEDBACK THAT I HEAR FROM. LANDLORDS I KNOW IN SAN FRANCISCO AND AND I THINK I'LL SWEAR IS THAT -- SOMETIMES IT'S NOT THE LANDLORDS DODD DON'T WANT TO TAKE SECTION BUT SOMETIMES IT'S THE LOGISTICAL AND THE BUREAUCRACY AND SOMETIMES IN SAN FRANCISCO WE CUT THE LADIES -- AND AND SO WE NEED TO IMPROVE THAT BIKE -- CREATING -- CARROT -- AS WELL AS THE STICK IS IMPORTANT IN THESE TWO BILLS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLIMENTARY TO EACH OTHER. I'M SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AND I WOULD ALSO LOVE TO BE OUT OF THE CALL.

YES WE HAVE ENABLE RESPONDED THAT THE DISPARITY IN THE RENT THAT THEY COULD GET. ON THE PRIVATE MARKET VERSUS -- THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM IS SO GREAT THAT FOR THEM ITS FINANCIAL DECISION -- THE GLENDALE HOUSING AUTHORITIES SAY HIGH PERFORMING AGENCY SO DUROCHER SEE A RED TAPE THINGS LIKE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS THOSE THAT DO PARTICIPATE LOVE THE PROGRAM -- TERMS OF LAMMERS A PARTICIPATE THEY LOVE THE PROGRAM THEY FEEL THAT WE DO A GOOD JOB THERE AND THEY ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISPARITY IN IN THE LEASE UP SO. YOU PROBABLY MET BRAINSTORMING FOR YEARS AND SO YOU. COME UP WITH THIS IDEA YOU THINK THIS. NARROWS THE GAP BUT IT WOULD. ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AND AND DO OR OR DOES IT HAVE TO GO FURTHER. THIS PARTICULAR BILL HELPS HELPS NARROW THE GAP THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES THAT AGENCIES TAKE. TO HELP -- BRIDGETTE GAP AS WELL IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE CURE ALL BUT CERTAINLY THE MAIN REASON THAT WE HEAR FROM LANDLORDS -- AS TO THEIR CONCERNS AND IN PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM IS THAT FINANCIAL GAP THAT'S ALL THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT NOW PARTICULARLY THE NEWER LANDLORDS THAT ARE MORE -- INVESTORS AS OPPOSED TO MOM AND POP. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE LLC'S COMING IN AND FOR THEM IT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. EVEN SECOND GENERATION FAMILY OWNERS ARE LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM LINE. LARA NEW LANDLORDS WOULD BE LOOKING FOR TAX DEDUCTIONS OR MAYBE A TAX CREDIT DOESN'T HELP I'M. THERE'S A B. SHOULD BE INCHING TO SEE WHAT KIND OF REACTION YOU GET.

SENATE HUESO WILL START WITH ITEM NUMBER TEN AS BEFORE TWENTY TWO THEN WILL TURN IT OVER TO YOU FOR ITEM NUMBER EIGHT TEAM. SB [inaudible] SIX THIRTY FIVE THEIR WAY TO THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE SIR. AN ITEM NUMBER TEN PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY PRESENT -- SB FORTY TWO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT IMPROVE IMPROVE TO REMOVE THAT AIMS TO REMOVE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER. TO SUCCESSFUL RE ENTRY FOR THE LIVES OF YOUNG FAN EX OFFENDERS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE -- FOR THE HELP THEY PROVIDED OUR OFFICE AND IT IN THIS BILL AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT I WILL BE ADOPTING SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS -- SPECIFICALLY OUR OFFICE WILL DROP FALLING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS INCREASE THE CREDIT PERCENTAGE 250% OF WAGE WAGES PAID. ADD IN THE COMPLETION OF EITHER -- SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM A COGNITIVE THOUGHT -- BEHAVIOR THERAPY TREATMENT PROGRAM OR AN AN ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR NEXT VENDOR TO QUALIFY. AS A QUALIFY AN EMPLOYEE IN THIS -- PROGRAM OP PREVENT A DEDUCTION FOR WAGES USED. TO CALCULATE AS BE -- FOR TWO TO CREDIT THE TAXPAYER GETS INTO THE CREDIT OR THE DEDUCTION FOR QUALITY QUALIFYING WAGES PAID BUT NOT BOTH -- A IN IN RECENT THIS BILL IS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL HELP US -- TO REDUCE -- OFFENDER RECIDIVISM IN OUR IN OUR PRISON SYSTEMS -- IN RECENT DECADES THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO OF HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY. BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY IN TWO THOUSAND NINE CALIFORNIA PRISON POPULATION INCREASE 510083%. UPON RELEASE MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO FIND EMPLOYMENT. SO WILD OUR SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE -- A PUNISHMENT SYSTEM YOU GOT A PRESENT YOU YOU YOU. YOU YOU YOU DO YOUR TIME. OFTENTIMES IN OUR SYSTEM IN AMERICA [inaudible] A A OF A ONE YEAR -- JAIL SENTENCE OF ONE YEAR PRESENT OF THREE YEAR CAN BE A LIFE LONG SENTENCE THE STIGMA OF BEING AN EX FELON FOLLOWS PEOPLE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. OFTEN MAKING DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND EMPLOYMENT. AFTER OF PAIN THEIR THEIR THEIR DEBT. OVERWHELMINGLY EX OFFENDERS HAVE HAD TENUOUS RELATIONSHIPS TO THE LABOR MARKET. APPROXIMATELY 70% OF DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR ON EMPLOYABILITY. THESE EXPERT EX EXISTING BARRIERS. TO EMPLOYMENT AND SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY HELP FURTHER EXACERBATED BY EMPLOYERS AND WILLINGNESS TO HIRE EX OFFENDERS. THIS IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE SAYS STATISTICS DEMONSTRATE THE POSTING CAR CAR SERRATION EMPLOYMENT IS A MAJOR FACTOR. IN THE SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION OF RELEASED. OFFENDERS SO THIS BILL SUPPORTS THE SKILL BUILDING APPROACHES ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE STATE BY. QUALIFIED FOR TRAINING PROGRAMS BY PROVIDING A TAX INCENTIVE TO EMPLOYERS WHO HIRE FORMERLY INCARCERATED USE. WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A WORK READING THIS PROGRAM SO WHILE WE'RE TRAINING ON PROVIDING THEM SKILLS? PEOPLE STILL DON'T WANT EMPLOYMENT. THEY CAN GET THEIR GED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THEY CAN GET A CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION WHEN ONE OF THE TRADES. AND STILL PEOPLE DON'T WANNA. SB FOUR TWO TWO SIMPLER TAX CREDIT WILL ALLOW A QUALIFIED IMPORT LAWYER. TAXPAYER WHO HIRES FULL TIME EMPLOYEES A CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT EQUAL 250% OF THE QUALIFIED WAGES PAID BY THE TAXPAYER. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT COSTS ROUGHLY ROUGHLY SIXTY THOUSAND A YEAR TO INCARCERATE A PRISONER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. USING THE NUMBERS IN THE ANALYSIS THIS PROGRAM KEEPS TWELVE YOUNG EX OFFENDERS FROM RE OFFENDING THAT THIS THIS PROGRAM WOULD COST THE STATE NOTHING. IN TAX REVENUE. GIVEN THE SOCIAL BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEXT OFFENDER NOT GOING BACK TO PRISON. ULTIMATELY THE SAVINGS WOULD BE EVEN GREATER LET'S TURN EX OFFENDERS LESTER PRISONERS INTO -- CONSTRUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY LET'S CINNAMON TO TAXPAYERS LET'S HELP THEM REALIZE THIR AMERICAN DREAM LET'S PROVIDE THEM AN EDUCATION. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY IN AND HELP ME SUPPORT THIS POPULATION GET ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN DREAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

WHEN THEY'RE GOING ABOUT HIRING THE PERSON BUT THEY DO KNOW? THAT THE PERSON IS AN EX OFFENDER [inaudible] AND IT'S A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM THE BILL'S TRYING TO ADDRESS. IS NOT THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. WITH THE PERSON BUT THE FACT THAT THEIR EX OFFENDER ANDERS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HIRING. AGAINST PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEIR EX OFFENDERS. SO I I'M I'M I'M TROUBLED BY THIS [inaudible] ADDED. I JUST TROUBLED BY THE ADDITIVES AMENDMENT THAT WAS SUGGESTED HERE AND I I DON'T KNOW IT'S A VALID AMENDMENT -- I QUESTION THE AYE AYE. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S THERE IT SAYS -- PEOPLE WITH THESE -- THAT EX OFFENDERS HAVE THESE PROBLEMS -- I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THOSE THINGS ANYMORE THAN NON EX OFFENDERS SO. WHY IT CAN YOU COMMENT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT? I I I I JUST I I I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE. THAT AMENDMENT IF I WAS VOTING ON THIS. I THINK THIS PUTS INNER ADDED ADDED IMPEDIMENT ON THE PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. YOU KNOW I I AGEE WITH YOU THAT THAT AMENDMENT PUTS -- OF THAT IT MAKES AN ASSUMPTION THAT SOMEBODY IS IMPRISONED FOR ONE OF THOSE ISSUES YEAH THAT'S WHEN A PART NUMBER AND AND FOR YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T OF ADDED THAT AMENDMENT MYSELF EITHER GIVEN. THE BROAD RANGE OF OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE GO TO PRISON BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT IT -- IN SOME INSTANCES THERE ARE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR SOME PROGRAMS ALLOW PEOPLE OF THE POTENTIAL TO GET A REDUCED SENTENCE OF THEY GO THROUGH -- DRUGS -- EDUCATION OR DRUG TREATMENT. PROGRAM AND THAT IS THAT USUALLY COVERS A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE POPULATION NOT EVERYBODY. AND THE OTHER AMENDMENT HAD TO DEAL WITH -- THE THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR. THERAPY -- AGAIN ARE THERE IS SOME -- PEOPLE IN IN PRISON THAT FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY AS WELL AND THEY ARE ALSO WITHIN THE SYSTEM REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH. SOME KIND OF TREATMENT PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS THEM -- TO ALSO QUALIFY FOR A REDUCED SENTENCE AND AND THEY ALSO -- OFFER THAT WITHIN OUR PRISON SYSTEM. BUT AGAIN WHAT IF YOU DON'T FALL IN THAT. CATEGORY BUT THERE ARE OUR PERCENTAGE. I FELT I FIGURED THAT ON ENTER ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AT THE VERY LEAST WOULD DO ALMOST ANYBODY SOME GOOD. ANYBODY WHETHER YOU HAVE A MATT ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR NOT A PROBLEM OR NOT YOU YOU YOU WOULD BE WELL. SHOULD I AGAIN THESE ARE NOT MY AMENDMENTS -- THE CHAIRMAN AS A VERY INFLUENTIAL MAN AND AND AND AND I I I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW THEY THEY THEY MAKE IT HARDER ON THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT DO NEED OUR HELP BUT AT THE SAME TIME THESE PROGRAMS COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. I I CAN IS COMMON RIGHT LOOK I THINK THAT THE WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO HIT. IS BEING ABLE TO MOVE -- THE INDIVIDUAL FORWARD. AND IF YOU'RE COMING OUT OF PRISON FOR EXAMPLE -- BEING ABLE IN IF YU'VE BEEN IN PRISON FOR QUITE SOME TIME TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A WORK READING THIS CLASS IS GONNA BE CRITICAL TO YOUR SUCCESS LONG TERM. IF YOU ARE -- IF YOU DO HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT TREATMENT. OUT OF THE WALL -- IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ANGER MANAGEMENT. I'M TO BE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE FROM EITHER OF THESE PROGRAMS -- IN IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO HELP AN INDIVIDUAL BROWN THEMSELVES OUT -- AND BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AFTER SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN MAY FACE. IT'S NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO BE A TO CREATE ALL OF THEM THAT BEING ABLE TO PICK ONE OF THEM THE BILL TO BECOME THAT INDIVIDUAL WANT TO BE. YOU WANT TO BE LONG TERM AND WE BELIEVE THAT EACH OF THESE ARE SELF HELP. AN END TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON YOURSELF IN CANADA THE I THINK. IN A MINIMUM EVERYTHING IN REGARDS OUR WORK READING THIS WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A WELL ROUNDED INDIVIDUAL LONGER TERM. BE MARKETABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE AS WELL THAT'S WHY WE ARE ADVANCE THAT -- LOOKING AT THAT WELL ROUNDED INDIVIDUAL -- MISTER CHAIRMAN. OUR I BELIEVE THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WILL ADD COSTS THAT WILL BE TAKEN UP IN APPROPRIATIONS. BECAUSE IT WILL INVOLVE COST TO PAY FOR THESE. PROGRAMS. AND THE THEY WILL ALSO ADD DELAY THE TO THE PERSON. ENTERING IN THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY WOULD FIRST HAVE TO COMPLETE THESE PROGRAMS PRIOR TO BEING ENTERED INTO THIS PROGRAM. SO I THINK I THINK THOSE ARE THE IMPEDIMENTS I'M TALKING ABOUT IT'S A BARRIER. FOR SOMEBODY ENTERING INTO THESE PROGRAMS. SO -- AND ANNA ANNA AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE WAS USED. TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION REGARDING -- THE COMPLETION OF THESE PROGRAMS. FOR AN EX OFFENDER TO QUALIFY. FOR TO BE A QUALIFYING EMPLOYERS IN THE BILL SO I AM. I AM -- TROUBLED BY -- I WISH THAT WE COULD -- HAVE THESE AMENDMENTS RECONSIDERED AT SOME POINT. IF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE -- PUTS A IN ORDER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. FOR EXAMPLE. THERE THEY WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME YOU CAN'T JUST WALK INTO A SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM AND LEAVE IN THIRTY DAYS IT TAKES WHILE IT IS TIME CONSUMING IT'S SO -- SO IT PUTS A BARRIER IN THE PERSON ENTERING INTO THE PROGRAM. SO OF THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY. I WOULD -- PERHAPS AS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FOR GOING TO MOVE THIS BILL. TO CONSIDER -- WHETHER THAT THE CLUSTER WORDS -- PURSUING. AND THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER -- DROPPING THIS AMENDMENT. HE STEP HEADS UP THIS ALREADY IS ABOVE. THE FISCAL [inaudible] FOR TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT THIS BILL AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS. YEAH BUT I'M SAYING THAT THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WHEN THEY LOOK AT THESE AMENDMENTS DISS ACROSS? THE PUSHES THE COST OF THE PROGRAM UP. ABOVE SO THE COST OF THE THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPY ALL THESE THINGS. ADD TO THE COST OF THE PROGRAM WHICH MAKES IT MORE. IT MAKES A BEYOND A TWENTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT EIGHT THAT'S WHY HE IS ALREADY KEY THIS IS SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO PRIOR TO THESE IN THEM INTO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S CLEAR IT'S ALREADY QUEUED IS. SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND CENTER NIELSEN [inaudible] THEY ARE. THEN THE INCARCERATED POPULATION THEIR CONSTANCE. ONE OF WHICH EARLY ON SADLY. THEY DIDN'T GET NURTURED THE DIFFICULTY. SOMETIMES FROM THE WALMART AND THEN [inaudible] DRUGS [inaudible] ALCOHOL [inaudible] GANGS THE COME LATER. WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL FIND REFUGE FROM THEIR OWN PAIN [inaudible] THE INCARCERATIONS PURPOSES PUNISHMENT AND REHABILITATION REHABILITATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND IT ISN'T JUST IMPORTANT. TO GO TO A A IS TO BE ABLE TO INTERNALIZE A A IN OTHER WORDS GET. TO BE ABLE TO APPLY. THE TENANTS OF A EIGHT WHEN YOU RELEASE [inaudible] THE CREDITS. HISTORICALLY. THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED. WE'RE TO BE BASED ON COMPLETION OF PROGRAM [inaudible] NOT JUST. PUT IN YOUR BOTTOM IN A CHAIR. AND SITTING THERE BECAUSE THAT IS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE IS NOT HELPFUL. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. WE'RE PUTTING PEOPLE OUT WE SHOULD BE. A COURT IN THEM. TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE POSSIBLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED INTO SOCIETY? AND BY NOT HAVING SOME REQUIREMENTS. FOR BEING INVOLVED IN TREATMENT. I THINK IT'S FOLLY. AND GREATLY IMPAIRS THE OPPORTUNITY OF THAT INDIVIDUAL TO SUCCEED AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE OUR OVERALL INTENT HERE TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS BOND RELEASE. THE SIX FEET. SO THIS IS A CONTINUUM OF THE TREATMENT REQUIREMENTS ELEVEN QUESTION RATED TO DO SOMETHING. ABOUT YOUR FUTURE AND YOUR DIFFICULTIES WHILE YOU'RE INCARCERATED. AND THEN TO AVAIL YOURSELVES OF OPPORTUNITIES UPON RELEASE. TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL THAT THESE AMENDMENTS BE RETAINED. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT THAT'S THE DEAN OF THE SENATE CENTER NIELSEN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THOSE WORDS I THINK THE OTHER PIECE IT IS. IMPORTANT TO BE A NOTE ON THESE AMENDMENTS. THESE AMENDMENTS ALLOW FOR MORE -- INDIVIDUALS WERE COMIN OUT OF PRISON TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THIS TAX CREDIT. SO AS THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY FOCUSED WORK READINESS WAS IN THE BILL PRIOR TO COMING IS COMMITTEE. WHEN WE ADD THESE ADDITIONAL ITEMS SUCH AS? SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY ANGER MANAGEMENT IT ACTUALLY CA IT WILL LOOK A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE ABLE QUALIFY FOR THIS TAX CREDIT. UNDER THE BILL THE TEN GETS MUCH LARGER -- IN THAT IN. PLEASE I WANT TO PUT WORDS IN HIS IN A WAY SAYS MATH BUT I I I BELIEVE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THIS COMMONSENSE TAX CREDITS WAS MANY FOLKS AS POSSIBLE IN THE STATE. IS -- WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO CAPTURE AND SO THAT WAS THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT THE MORE -- TRIGGERS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS BILL HIGHER THE POPULATION WILL BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT CENTER MORE LOCK. THE COMMISSION JR CENTER HUESO THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF EMPLOYERS THAT ARE EXCLUDED. THOSE THAT PROVIDE RETAIL SERVICES IN THOSE THAT PROVIDE FOOD SERVICES AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHY THAT WOULD BE THE CASE OKAY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. AND IT IS BASED ON TAX CREDITS OF A EXISTING PROGRAM THAT WE ALREADY HAVE SO IT IS WERE KINDA REQUIRING. OF THE THE UTILIZATION OF THOSE SAME CODES. I THAT ARE IN AND ALREADY IN STATUTE. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. SO IF YOU WANT TO WORK FOR A GAS STATION THAT HAS A CONVENIENCE STORE THAT WOULD BE. DROP THE QUALIFIED. DEPENDING ON THE JOB DESCRIPTION IF YOU WORKING AS A MECHANIC IN A IN A IN A JOB A GAS STATION HAS A RETAIL ELEMENT YOU WOULD YOU WOULD QUALIFY. YOU WOULD QUALIFY YOU WOULD AS A MECHANIC YET EVEN THOUGH IT'S HAS RETAIL SALES SERVICE YES AS A MECHANIC. STRAIN. JUST SATISFY CURIOSITY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL YOU KNOW I I'VE I'VE NEVER DONE THIS SOMEONE DO SO LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF HIGH PRESENTS BILL AND AND I AND I WANT TO JUST GIVE GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE OF MY MY EXPERIENCE. IN LIFE AND HOW I CAME TO BE WHERE I AM HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND AND I THINK IT'S VERY SPECIFIC TO THIS BILL SO I KNOW YOU'RE VERY BUSY BUT IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME [inaudible] YOU KNOW. I USED TO I USED TO BE IN BUSINESS AND I RAN A BUSINESS AND A AND IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE I GREW UP. AND IT WAS -- WELL IT'S ONE OF THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT IS AS BEEN KIND OF THE AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW A LOW SOCIOECONOMIC NEIGHBORHOOD -- WHERE YOU HAVE -- HIGH POVERTY RATES WHERE YOU HAVE A LOW INVESTMENT RATES. AND AND I HAD AN EXPERIENCE ONE TIME WHERE I DROVE INTO A MORE AFFLUENT PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND AND THEY THERE WAS THIS BEAUTIFUL BUILDING. THAT WAS BEING TORN DOWN. AND IT AND IT JUST SHOCKED ME HOW THEY WOULD TEAR DOWN A ROOM. OF A BIG BUILDING A NICE BUILDING. THEY WERE TEARING DOWN TO BUILD SOMETHING BRAND NEW. AND IT SHOCKED ME AND MADE ME IT MADE ME -- INTROSPECTIVE AND I STARTED THINKING WHY DOESN'T THAT HAPPEN IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE WE HAVE -- PROPERTY THAT'S LOWER VALUED WHERE YOU COULD COME IN AND BUY US. A YOU CAN GET A GOOD DEAL ON A PROPERTY WHERE YOU CAN -- BUILD ALMOST ANYTHING YOU WANT. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO AREAS WERE PROPERTIES MORE EXPENSIVE MAKING THESE BIG INVESTMENTS AND BUILDING THERE AND IT JUST DOESN'T IT FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT THAT OFTEN DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO SOMEBODY. WHO IS TRYING TO SAVE WHO'S TRYING TO CUT COSTS WHO'S TRYING TO CREATE EFFICIENCIES WHY DON'T YOU INVEST? PLACES WHERE WHERE LAND IS MORE CHEAP OR YOU COULD GET CHEAPER LABOR WHERE YOU COULD -- GET OFTENTIMES A BETTER DEAL ON YOUR INVESTMENT. AND THAT LED ME -- TO TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT I ACTUALLY -- IN ROLLED AT SAN DIEGO STATE IN AN AND GOT A DEGREE AND AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND I FROM THERE. I I ACTUALLY STARTED BUSINESS ASSOCIATION AND I START ADVOCATING FOR MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND FROM THERE I ACTUALLY WENT TO WORK FOR THE CITY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIVISION. WORKING IN BUSINESS EXPANSION A RETENTION I ACTUALLY WORKED IN REDEVELOPMENT. AND HELP TO FOCUS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS AND HELP TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT INTO UNDERSERVED AREAS. AND OFTENTIMES WITHOUT AN ACTIVE PROGRAM PEOPLE WILL NOT COME AND INVEST IN UNDERSERVED AREAS IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ON ITS OWN. AND AND YOU ACTUALLY NEED PROGRAMS TO ATTRACT PEOPLE TO BASICALLY MAKE A SALES PITCH IN STATE IF YOU INVEST HERE. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET. AND I ACTUALLY WORKED IN THAT AREA AND I HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS BEING YOU BRING IN THAT INVESTMENT INTO UNDERSERVED AREAS REDEVELOPMENT USED TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL. TO HELP SHAPE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND NOT ONLY DID WE USE REDEVELOPMENT WE USE THE AN ENTERPRISE ON OVERLAYS TO SAY LOOK WE HAVE REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS WE HAVE AN ENTERPRISE ZONE. WE HAVE -- FEDERALLY DESIGNATED. ZONES THAT ARE -- ALSO GIVE A CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS. SO. WHILE OFTEN PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW IN NICE NEIGHBORHOODS PEOPLE MAKE INVESTMENTS. AS AS MANY AS THEY DO AND UNDERSERVED AREA SO THESE PROGRAMS REALLY DON'T HELP I THINK THAT'S A FLAWED ANALYSIS I THINK THAT IS BEING MADE BY PEOPLE THAT I HAVE NEVER REALLY WORKED. IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT UNDERSTAND HOW. HAVING ADDITIONAL TOOLS IN YOUR TOOL BELT. COULD HELP MAKE. CERTAIN PROJECTS A REALITY IN AREAS WHERE THERE WOULD BE NO INVESTMENT AT ALL. I'VE LIVED IT I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED AND I COULD I COULD BRING YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT AND SHOW THAT PROP PROJECTS THAT WE BROUGHT USING THESE PROGRAMS. THAT NOW ARE CREATING JOBS THAT NOW ARE PRE PROVIDING. OF FOD IN IN AREAS THAT WERE FOOD DESERT'S. YOU KNOW WE HAD FOOD DOES RETURN FOOD SWAMPS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD NOW WE HAVE LOCALLY OWNED BUSINESSES THAT ARE THERE PROVIDING OF FOOD OASIS WE HAVE SUPERMARKETS ARE PROVIDING ACCESS TO DREDGE. AFFORDABLE NUTRITIOUS FOODS ALL OF THEM. ALL OF THESE PROJECTS IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER WERE MADE A REALITY BECAUSE ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS. SO I THOUGHT IN THE IN IN IN THE ABSENCE OF OF OF HAVING A VERY CLEAR STRATEGY AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO REDEVELOP THESE THESE UNDERSERVED AREAS. THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT BE. THE COMPLETE SOLUTION BUT WOULD BE ANOTHER TOOL IN A TOOL BELT TO HELP. LOCALS COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS -- TO A SALES PITCH OF MARKETING TOOL -- OF A BUSINESS EXPANSION AND RETENTION -- TOOL TO HELP. OUR OF THE FOCUS INVESTMENT IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. SO THIS BILL. IN ESSENCE WOULD CONFORM CALIFORNIA'S PERSONAL INCOME AND TERM IN TALK IN COME TAX LAW. AND OUR COACH TO PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE THAT ALLOW FIRST. SPECIFIED TAX TREATMENT FOR LOW. INCOME THERE IN INCOME DERIVED FROM ACTIVITIES WITHIN FAT FEDERALLY DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITIES SOUNDS. IN ESSENCE THIS BILL WOULD IT WOULD OF PASS ON THOSE IN SPEAK A TAX INCENTIVES CREATED BY. THE OPPORTUNITIES ON PROGRAM AT THE FACT FOR PROGRAM -- AND AND AND PROVIDE THOSE LOCALLY. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO THIS. WE OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY ARE DOING THIS WE NEED TO OFFER OUR UNDERSERVED AREAS THIS THIS INCENTIVE -- THIS WOULD -- WOULD THIS WOULD HELP US COMPETE. FOR BILLIONS TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING REYES NATIONALLY. TO AND INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES SOUNDS WHY WOULDN'T WE ALLOW. OUR OFFER TO RESULTS TO BIT BENEFIT FROM. THESE INVESTMENTS IF WE ADJUST OUR TAX CODE AND PEOPLE DON'T HAPPEN TO THEM AND WE DON'T SEE THIS INVESTMENT COME TO THOSE AREAS. NOTHING IS LOST BUT IF WE DO. WE COULD HELP TRANSFORM THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEN BUILD HOUSING BUILD SUPERMARKETS BUILD ODD JOB CREATING INDUSTRIES IN NOT BE BUILT THERE. AND SO I I ASKED THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNTY TO SEE THE THE WISDOM IN THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT WOULD IT WOULD GIVE THESE UNDERSERVED AREAS. ARE AN ADDITIONAL -- A TOOL. TO HELP BRING THOSE INVESTMENTS TO THESE AREAS THESE ARE JOBS FOR THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. THESE ARE IMPORTANT PROJECTS WHEN YOU SAY THAT THESE INVESTMENTS WOULD WOULD GO OTHER ELSEWHERE. NATURALLY THEN YOU'VE NEVER HAD TO TAKE. A TROLLEY OR A BUS. TEN MILES TO GO TO THE SUPERMARKET. YOU'VE NEVER HAD TO DO THAT. AND IF AND IF THIS PROJECT TO BRING A SUPERMARKET TO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD A COULD TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO TO EITHER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR AN AUTOMOBILE OR OR THE ABILITY TO GET TO A SUPERMARKET THIS TEN MILES AWAY. I I REPRESENT. AND I HAVE THE REP I REPRESENT SOME COMMUNITIES ARE CURRENTLY DEALING WITH THAT. AND I REPRESENTS SOME COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD BE ONE VERY WELL SERVED. BY THIS BILL I ALSO REPRESENT SOME THAT HAVE ACTIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE WORKING TO TO BRING INVESTMENT TO THOSE AREAS IN THIS WOULD HELP THEM -- GIVE AN ACT PUT AN ACTUAL ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TO BELT TO HELP THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESS WHO REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. HER NAME IS UP. MARIA BUT DESTACA. EN AND SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AS FOR THE BILL IF IF YOU'LL ALLOW THAT MISTER SHERMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SANTORUM'S BUT HE SAID WELCOME WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES IN THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THIS CALL IS PLEASE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ON THIS BILL. WE APPRECIATE SENATOR WESO FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO LEGISLATURE -- WE HAD THE CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE HAVE SUPPORTED MANY OTHER BILLS TO INCREASE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INTO INTO CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY FOR OUR BUSINESS MEMBERS. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC EFFORT OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. ULTIMATELY THIS BILL IS A GREAT WAY TO BRING IN CAPITAL TO THE AREAS THAT NEED IT THE MOST AND FOR THAT WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GROUP OF YOUR TESTIMONY GOOD MORNING SIR GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- PULLED LEVEL TO APEX GROUP ALSO REPRESENTING THAT SPENDING CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE -- CENTER HUESO ELOQUENTLY LAID OUT THE REASONS WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED -- WE KNOW THAT WE HAD ECONOMIC ENTERPRISE ZONES AND AND THE STATE FOR A LONG TIME -- WE NO LONGER HAVE THOSE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS OF THIS IS WOULD BE WHAT I'D CALL A TWO POINT NO VERSION. OF THAT -- USING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLAN IT CERTAINLY HELPS A LOT OF LATINO COMMUNITIES. AND COMMUNITIES WERE A YOU HAVE -- MINORITIES THAT DON'T GET THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES THAT IF THEY ONLY HAD THOSE AND HAD CAPITAL INFUSION OF THOSE AREAS WOULD PROVIDE A GREAT BENEFIT. AND WITH THAT -- I JUST WANNA MAKE THOSE COMMENTS AND WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE BILL. BECAUSE MY TO SCRATCH OUT A GREAT PLAYER HERE WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO GET OPEN UP TO ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD LOOKING FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE ADVANCE. LAST CALL NOW LIKELY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL PIC PLEASE ADVANCE. LOOKING FOR OPPOSITION LAST CALL. WHEN I? COMING ON BACK ADD TO THOSE WHO I THIS BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO BE EVER QUESTIONS CONVERSATIONS. AND OR ANY DEBATE DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CONVERSATIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE CENTER ABOUT -- THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL -- OPPORTUNITY -- ACT -- IS KIND OF A BROAD [inaudible] BASED THING. THAT -- APPLIES TO FEDERAL TAX CREDITS AND SO FORTH. HOWEVER -- DEALING WITH CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND POVERTY. OF ONE WOULD WOULD [inaudible] A OPPORTUNITY ARE TAILORED TO CALIFORNIA BE MORE TAILORED TO THOSE TWO ISSUES HIRING HIRING PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE OPPORTUNITY JONES. OR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS YOU KNOW OR PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OF FOR THOSE AREAS AND I THINK I THINK -- THE ISSUE OF OPPORTUNITY JONES. BENEFITING OTHER THAN POOR PEOPLE. SUCH AS THE GENTRIFICATION OR BUSINESSES LOCATING IN IN THOSE AREAS AND GETTING THE TAX BREAK BUT NOT REALLY. MAKING AN EFFORT TO HIRE PEOPLE -- THAT NEED WORK -- IS AN ISSUE SO MAYBE PERHAPS YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE. WHAT I? I I THINK I THINK MORE OR MORE OR LESS PEOPLE THINK THOSE ARE THE FLAWS OF THE FEDERAL. FEDERAL PROGRAM IT WASN'T DIRECTLY RELATED. TO HIRING POOR PEOPLE AND UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE PROVIDING JOBS FORUM. WASN'T IT -- SPECIFIC ENOUGH ON THAT WAS MORE A BROAD BASE. TAX -- PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING INTO A VERY COMPLEX AREA BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS AS WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS SOUGHT TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN AND AND ONLY MADE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT IN THE AREAS WHERE YOU BUILD IT YOU OFTEN RUN INTO FEDERAL LAWSUIT -- ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS THAT DON'T ALLOW. YOU -- TO THE TWO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE THAT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BENEFIT FROM THESE PROJECTS. WE WE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF OF OF OF HI HIGHER IN. LOCALLY OF OF BUILDING PROJECTS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT PROVIDE HOUSING TO THE PEOPLE OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND OFTENTIMES WE RUN INTO -- STATUTES THAT THAT PREVENT YOU FROM MAKING THOSE SPECIFIC [inaudible] LAWS. AGAIN IN THIS BILL. WERE WERE WORKING WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT WE WE WE ALREADY HAVE OUR SYSTEM -- YOU KNOW IF I IF I COULD -- CREATE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM IT WOULD IT WOULD LOOK VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE WE HAVE BUT UNFORTUNATELY. WE'RE WORKING WITHIN A FEDERAL TAX CODE THAT IS -- SET IN STONE A PROGRAM THAT IS SET IN STONE IT'S OFFERING US -- INVESTMENT INTO THESE AREAS. IF I I JUST WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE FOR CALIFORNIA TO TO BENEFIT FROM THESE INVESTMENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL BRING HOUSING IT'S AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE HOUSING IT WILL BRING SUPERMARKETS AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE SUPERMARKETS IT WILL BRING -- THE KIND OF INVESTMENTS THAT WILL BRING JOBS TO AREAS THAT HAVE LOW JOBS -- DOES. GENERALLY YOU KNOW I'VE AGAIN I WOULD LIKE. THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN MY PORT COMMUTERS TO WORK ON THE PORT. AND I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO PUSH THAT BECAUSE THOSE ARE VERY HIGH PAYING JOBS AND UNFORTUNATELY OFTENTIMES IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. PEOPLE MAKE A CERTAIN WAGE AND MOVE OUT INTO A DIFFERENT AREA AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN. TO SOME WHAT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T PREVENT AND THAT WE I I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PREVENT IT. PEOPLE US ARE MAKING MONEY AND THEY WANT TO MOVE OUT WE CAN'T STOP THEM [inaudible] BUT I I AM LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW -- AT AT WHAT WE CAN GET FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THAT IS. POTENTIALLY BILLIONS. OF OF INVESTMENT DOLLARS IN INTO OUR MOST UNDERSERVED AREAS. AND THE THESE COULD PROVIDE -- LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PEOPLE THOSE AREAS AGAIN IT'S IT'S WE OFTENTIMES. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAVING THESE INCENTIVES COULD HELP. UP PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. A TRACK THAT THE THE THE RIGHT KIND OF INVESTMENT FOR THOSE NOTES. NEIGHBORHOODS THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ON AN ON ITS OWN I THINK OF WE CREATE THIS. PEOPLE SOMEWHERE INVEST IN A BUSINESS AREN'T GONNA DAHLE THE SENSE WHO WHILE LOOK WE CAN. WE CAN DRIVE A BENEFIT FROM THIS PEOPLE GENERALLY NOT NOW IT WILL BE THE THE THE THE THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP THE DEPARTMENTS THAT THAT FOCUS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REVITALIZATION. TO TO ATTRACT THAT INVESTMENT AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL HAVE A PROGRAM. AND WE YOU KNOW WE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR. THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THAT WILL REQUIRE GOBIZ. TO WORK WITH LOCALS ON ON ON HELPING TO ATTRACT FEDERAL DOLLARS AND HELPING. TO ATTRACT STATE DOLLARS INTO A PROMISE ZONES AND OPPORTUNITIES ON SO OFTEN AREA DOESN'T HAVE A PROGRAM THE STATE DOES AND AND AND WE WILL -- ED AND I AND I THINK THROUGH OUR GOLD IS GIVING THIS TO OUR GOAL BUT IS. IS WELL. WILL HELP GOBIZ ADVOCATE FOR THE THE IS -- UNDERSERVED AREAS AND PROVIDE DISINCENTIVES. TWO PEOPLE INVEST IN HOPEFULLY WILL WILL WILL WILL DRAW THE RIGHT pNEIGHBORHOODS. THE ONE THAT BUILDS ON THE NEEDS OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT ALL OF US TOGETHER. CAN CAN WORK TO ALSO -- TRACK THIS INVESTMENT TO COMMUNITIES. OF SENATOR IF I COULD SENATOR DIFFICULT MYSTICALLY SIR AUG. OF WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE SENATE COUNCIL. I AUTHORED THE PROPOSAL'S GREAT THE FIRST ENTERPRISE ZONE IN CALIFORNIA IN SAN JOSE. AND WE HAD -- IMPLEMENTED THE CAMP GARCIA LAW. WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL ENTERPRISE ZONE ACT AND I ACTUALLY HAD -- CONGRESSMAN GARCIA FROM THE BRONX. TOUR AND I DROVE AROUND THE AREA DURING THE ENTERPRISE ZONE. OF AND HE WORKED WITH JACK CAM. OF RESERVE REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT. JOINT -- LAW CONGRESS CAME FROM BUFFALO AND THEN -- REPUBLICAN AND THEN CONGRESSMAN GARCIA. FROM -- THE BRONX. AND THE AGE DIGIS. IT WAS DONE BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE WORKED. FOR THE MURDER SOME OF THESE AREAS AND YOU KNOW NO OTHER KINDS OF OR MARINO OR STRATEGIES WORK SO THE DECIDED TO LOOK AT THE TAX INCENTIVE IDEA [inaudible] AND THE CALIFORNIA ACT WAS CREATED WE LIMITED THE CALC -- FOR KIDS YOU KNOW AND AND TWENTY ELEVEN AND REESTABLISH -- THE GO BILL AS ANY OTHER KINDS OF BENEFITS -- WITH -- A STUDY THAT WAS DONE ON ENTERPRISE ZONE THAT SHOWED. THE ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA THAT SHOWED. US SOME OF THE ENTERPRISE ZONES WERE SOME OF THEM DON'T WERE. THERE WASN'T A CLEAR GOAL. AND SO WHAT WHAT WHAT MY QUESTIONS ARE. FOR YOU IS WE DON'T WANT TO RE ESTABLISH A PROGRAM THAT REPEATS THE SAME MISTAKES. THAT WE HAD WITH THE ENTERPRISE ZONE BECAUSE SOMEONE WORK SOME OF THEM DON'T WORK AND WE WE CAN'T. WE DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT KIND OF THING AGAIN LIKE WE DID. IN THE PAST -- AND WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE ENTERPRISE ZONES BECAUSE IT WAS. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO TWENTY ELEVEN THE ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE DO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITHOUT. WE KNOW THE RESULTS IN. OF AS A TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IT IT HAD SOME FLAWS. HOW DO YOU REVEREND RE THING WE DO WILL HAVE SOME FLAWS NOTHING IS PERFECT BUT LET ME TELL YOU READ IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT THE OUTCOME IF YOU SAY THIS BUSINESS WOULD HAVE LOCATED? IN SAN DIEGO ANYWAY LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THIS BILL WITH THE THIS DIDN'T CREATE [inaudible] NEW. NEW WELL YOU YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT [inaudible] BUT WHETHER THEY LOCATED IN THE STUDIO THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL AREA IN THE MORE AFFLUENT PART A CITY OR WHETHER THEY LOCATED IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA. I CAN TELL YOU WHOLE HEARTEDLY I CAN NAME BUSINESSES. THAT SPECIFICALLY WENT -- TO UNDERSERVED AREA PROVIDE LOCAL JOBS ALL THE HIRES WERE LOCAL. AND THEY MOVE THEIR SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF CERTAIN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAD THAT NO LONGER EXISTS. AND I COULD PROVIDE YOU A LONG LIST OF BUSINESSES. THAT WERE THERE SOME OF THEM THERE ARE NO LONGER THERE. WINDOWS PROGRAMS AND DID. SOME OF THOSE BUSINESS MOVED OUT. AND WEB BUT WHERE THEY WERE IT INITIALLY. LOOKING TO GO [inaudible] AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THOSE JOBS IS THOSE JOBS OR THIS PLACE IN THAT AREA PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING TO WORK. NOW EITHER HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THE STATE OR OR OR TAKE OUT -- OR A OR MATH MATH THE MASS OF OUR OR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTY. AND AND THAT'S WHAT. IN IN ONE PART THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THIS BILL COULD HELP. IN THOSE AREAS IS TO PROVIDE LOCALIZED JOBS TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IN AN AREA THAT THEY ONLY LIVED THERE FOR THE TO PORTABLE BUT THEY THEY THEY WERE ALSO CREATING JOBS THAT ARE BETTER PAYING JOBS THAT WILL GIVE THEM A JOB WHERE THEY LIVE. AND IT AND IT AND IN MANY CASES THERE DURING GOING TO BE JOBS. THAT THEY CAN -- YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH THAT REPORT THAT TALKS ABOUT -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF SOMEBODY HAVING A JOB. OR OT OFTENTIMES IS WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO GET TO THE JOB. AND THAT THE FURTHER JOB THE JOB IS AWAY FROM THOSE INDIVIDUALS. MAY MEAN WHETHER THEY CAN GET THE JOB AND I WANT I WANT TO LOCATE JOBS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS I WANNA I WANNA LOCATE -- QUALITY JOBS THERE'S BUT IN THE END IF WE CAN PROVIDE JOBS TO PEOPLE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. IT WOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES AND I THINK THIS BILL. WHAT THE STUDIES HAVE NOT? ANALYZED IS WHETHER THESE BILLS ARE PROVIDING A JOBS IN THOSE AREAS I DON'T THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS AFFECTED BECAUSE IT DOESN'T CONFORM TO MY EXPERIENCE. I HAVE WORKED ON THIS AND I HAVE ATTRACTED BUSINESSES TO THESE AREAS AND THEY HAVE COME. BECAUSE OF OF OF A OF A OF BACK PACKAGE THAT WE PROVIDE THERE ARE THERE ARE. WHEN YOU COME IN AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE YOU A FEDERAL TAX RATE A STATE TAX CREDIT WE'RE GOING? TO PROVIDE YOU WITH -- A STATE DOLLARS WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH UP OF LEASES A REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS WAIT AROUND WELL. THAT'S IT WE DO IT ALL IN AS A WHAT WILL GO NINE THE INTERPRETERS ON WITH THE RE I ALWAYS BOAST OF CALIFORNIA'S -- INTACT I ALWAYS BOAST OF TEXAS CALIFORNIA'S TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE A VERY HEALTHY ONE BUT WE COULDN'T WE CAN DO MORE FOR THESE. THAT IS A STATE WIDE PROGRAM I I I I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING FOR THESE. UNDERSERVED AREAS IN THE ABSENCE OF REDEVELOPMENT AND AND UNLOCKED AND THIS IS NOT COMMITTEE IN -- STATE DOLLARS LIKE REDEVELOPMENT US A WEEK WE NEED TO DO MORE WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH BUT THIS WOULD WITHDRAW -- THOSE INVESTED AND IF IT FAILS IT WILL COST US NOTHING NO WAY CEREALS AND I APOLOGIZE WE JUST HAVE -- PRETTY BIG BILL COME IN RIGHT AFTER YOU AND I I DO APOLOGIZE IS PREGNANT TAKE A BIT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE OTHER ARE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR LET'S GO TO SEND HER TITLE PLEASE ON THIS BILL. MISTER CHAIR UP THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AND YOUR PASSION I CAN SEE IT. IN YOU AND AND EXPRESSING THAT TODAY -- YOU KNOW AS A COUNCIL MEMBER FOR THE CITY OF FINGER. THAT WAS MY BIGGEST FRUSTRATION THAT WAS. THE REASON FOR ME EVEN WANTING TO BE HERE TODAY IS THAT I SAW A LACK OF INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I REPRESENT ABOUT TWENTY THREE CITIES IN AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES. AND I HAVE SEEN THE LACK OF INVESTMENT OVER THE YEARS WITH REDEVELOPMENT ON I HAVE SEEN OUR COMMUNITIES JUST CONTINUE TO SUFFER. AND I I I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP ADDRESS ONE PIECE BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS ARE BEING MADE. NOT SOMETHING THAT I CONTINUE TO SAY -- YOU KNOW ALL THE TIME AND I'M SURE THAT MANY IN THIS IN THIS ROOM HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT INVESTING AND IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST BECAUSE UP. YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE JUST LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TO WELL I TO TO LIVE IN EIGHT EIGHT IN A COMMUNITY THAT BIG YOU KNOW THEIR CHILDREN ARE HAPPY AND THEN THEY CAN GO TO THE PARKS AND AND THAT.

FOUR SIXTY EIGHT BEFORE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA GET STARTED I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE CENTER JACKSON AND SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND ABLE TO DRIVE A COMPROMISE SAID GOOD NAY VANCE'S DATA DRIVEN. TRANSPARENT. UP PROCESS IN THE MINDS IN YEARS TO COME ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. ADAM SENATOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SHOULD JUST SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AFTER YOUR KIND REMARKS BUT I WILL PRESENT BECAUSE THIS IS A A NEW ISSUE THAT REALLY IS IS A NON PARTISAN ISSUE -- YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY WE'RE LOOKING FOR TRANSPARENCY -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS? SO THE SP FOUR SIXTY EIGHT IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASURE THAT WILL HELP US IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM OF TAX CREDITS TAX DEDUCTIONS AND TAX EXEMPTIONS. TO ENSURE WE'RE MAKING THE BEST USE OF OUR LIMITED PUBLIC DOLLARS SOMETHING WHICH I KNOW MY GOOD FRIEND SENATOR MORE LOCKED DOWN AN ORANGE COUNTY TALKS ABOUT. OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND TO THIS IS A A BILL I THINK HE SHOULD LOVE. SO I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEES WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH ME ON THE BILL AND I AM TAKING ACCEPTING AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY REFOCUS THE A CURRENT CONTENT OF THE BILL BY CREATING AN INDEPENDENT BODY. CALLED THE CALIFORNIA TAX EXPENDITURE REVIEW BOARD WHICH SOMEDAY WILL PROBABLY WOULD BE REFERRED TO IS CAL TURBA. AS WE DO EVERYTHING IN ACRONYMS HERE. BUT THIS BOARD WILL CREATE A PUBLIC PROCESS FOR THIS INDEPENDENT BODY TO SET UP A SCHEDULE. FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE STATE'S MOST COSTLY TAX EXPENDITURES ULTIMATELY ONCE EVALUATIONS BY THE LA OWES OFFICE ARE COMPLETE. THIS FIVE MEMBER BOARD WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON WHETHER TO CONTINUE. ALTER REPEAL OR AMEND THESE EIGHT TAX EXPENDITURES THAT ARE CAPTURED UNDER THIS BILL. NOW CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS NEARLY EIGHTY OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES WITCHER ESSENTIALLY TAX CREDITS -- THAT WE GIVE TO OF VARIOUS CORPORATIONS THEIR PROVISIONS IN THE TAX CODE THEY INCLUDE TAX CREDITS TAX DEDUCTION SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS. AND INCOME EXCLUSIONS THE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TAX COLLECTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVE. MANY TAX EXPENDITURES SO WERE CREATED DECADES AGO TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN GOALS AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVING INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS. INFLUENCING TAXPAYER BEHAVIOR OR SPURRING ECONOMIC GROWTH ALL WORTHY GOALS BUT THEY HAVE SAT ON THE BOOKS FOR DECADES WITHOUT ANY SCRUTINY ANY OVERSIGHT OR EVEN THE NECESSARY TO DEMINT DATA TO DEMONSTRATE THE RESULTS. THIS TAX EXPENDITURES KERRY SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME MANNER IS SPENDING PROGRAMS. THIS YEAR TAX EXPENDITURES WILL REDUCE REVENUE TO THE GENERAL FUND BY SOME SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. EVERY DOLLAR OF A TAX EXPENDITURE THE DOES NOT GENERATE ITS COST IN NEW REVENUE. TAKES APPROXIMATELY FORTY CENTS OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S CLASSROOMS THE A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES. ARE THESE TAX EXPENDITURES WORTH THEIR COST. IT'S A FAIR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION THE UNFORTUNATE FACT IS WE HAVE NO IDEA. A TWENTY FIFTEEN AUDIT BY THE STATE THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR REGARDING THE STATE'S TAX EXPENDITURES CONCLUDED QUOTE. ADOPTING OVERSIGHT METHODS WOULD IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE'S CURRENT AND FUTURE TAX EXPENDITURES PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH MORE INFORMATION AND A BETTER ACCOUNTING OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. AND IMPACT. A TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH BY THE PEW CHARITABLE CREW A TRUSS. SCORED CALIFORNIA AS TRAILING WITH TWENTY EIGHT OTHER STATES AHEAD OF US IN EVALUATING THEIR TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INFORMING THEIR LEGISLATURES TO THE VALUES OF SUCH PROGRAMS. AND THESE ARE RED STATES AND BLUE STATES STATES FROM ALABAMA FLORIDA MISSISSIPPI INDIANA. MARYLAND THE STATE OF WASHINGTON THE LIST GOES ON THIS IS SHOWS GOOD GOVERNANCE. THIS MEASURE SB FOUR SIXTY EIGHT WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF EXAMINING SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST TAX EXPENDITURES. TO EVALUATE WHETHER THEY'RE ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. THIS BILL CHOOSES AMONG THE LARGEST OF THE TAX CREDITS AND SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS. THAT HAVE NO METRICS IN EXISTENCE TO DETERMINE EFFICACY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM NO SUN SETTING PROVISIONS AND RESULT IN REVENUE LOSSES OF GREATER THAN A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. PER TAX CREDIT. THE BILL CREATES SAID INTEREST I APOLOGIZE BUT BECAUSE THIS IS NEW AND IN ON THERE ACTUALLY THE THE OLD ANALYSIS IS. MOOT NOW IT'S BEEN REPLACED BY THE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VEBEEN WORKING ON THAT WE'RE TAKING YESTERDAY. BUT THIS BILL CREATES A NON PARTISAN BOARD COMPRISED OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. THE STATE AUDITOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE OR THEIR DESIGNEES AND A REPRESENTATIVE WHICH STATE TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE A SCHEDULE FOR THE LA OWES OFFICE. TO ANALYZE THESE TAX EXPENDITURES TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE INDEED ACHIEVING THE GOALS INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND ONCE THE LA -- COMPLETED TO ANALYSIS THE BOARD HAVING CONSIDERED INFORMATION FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC REGARDING THE OZONOLYSIS WILL MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. AS TO WHETHER THE TAX EXPENDITURE AT ISSUE IS INDEED MEETING THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED OR WHETHER IT IS NOT. AND SHOULD BE ALTERED CONTINUED OR REPEALED THE BILL THEN REQUIRES THIS COMMITTEE. IN CONCERT WITH THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND TAX TO HOLD A SPECIAL EXCUSE ME A JOINT PUBLIC HEARING TO CONSIDER THE LA OWES REPORT IN THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATIONS. IT WOULD BE MY HOPE THEM THAT FOR ANY TAX EXPENDITURE FOUND TO HAVE OUT LIVED OR STRAIGHT FROM ITS PURPOSE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD VOTE TO ALTERNATE A TO ALTER OR TERMINATED. ON THE OTHER HAND IF IT IS INDEED MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OR DOING THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S FEELS ARE STILL APPROPRIATE IT WOULD RETAIN. THAT TAX READ SO. AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NEVER DONE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY AND ONE I HOPE THE LEGISLATURE CAN BUILD ON IT WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO CALIFORNIA'S TAX CONCERN OF A PROCESS BY CREATING A MECHANISM. AND A PUBLIC REVIEW PROCESS OF SO SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST COSTLY TAX EXPENDITURES. IT WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THEM ARE COST EFFECTIVE PROPERLY DESIGNED IN AFFECTING THE THEIR INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES AND WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND CHERYL HE DAY. FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

A GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM JUDY DAY VERY THE CHAIR FINANCE AND PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR C. T.. EIGHT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY DISCUSSES MUCH OVERDUE AND NEEDED CONVERSATION ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S TAX DOLLARS. AS THE GOOD SENATOR MENTIONED ALREADY -- LEGISLATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY TURNS TO TAX CREDITS TO ADVANCE POLICY INTERESTS AND OFTEN NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING OR DEBATING THE IMPACT OF THOSE TAX CREDITS OR EXEMPTIONS ON THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND OBLIGATIONS OR SCHOOLS FUNDING THROUGH -- SCHOOL FUNDING THROUGH PROP. NINETY EIGHT EVERY DOLLAR AS A SENATOR MENTIONED -- OF TAX CREDIT. TO THE GENERAL FUND TAKES APPROXIMATELY FORTY CENTS OUT OF CALIFORNIA CLASSROOMS. REPRESENTING THE SHARE OF REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FROM THE GENERAL FUND. CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT MORE THAN SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS IN THE PAST DECADE. THE PROPOSITION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SHARES OF THESE TOP TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS TOTALED MORE THAN TWENTY SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. DURING THE SAME DECADE OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CALIFORNIA CUT SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM SCHOOLS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET DURING THE RECESSION. AS EDUCATORS WE ARE HELD TO TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY EVERY DAY -- OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. BOTH TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT AND STREAMLINED. TO READ TO BE REGULARLY EVALUATED ON THEIR EFFECTIVENESS TO THE STATE. AS THE STATE AUDITOR NOTED IN A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATOR IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SOMEBODY'S TAX CREDITS ARE NOT ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS AND OTHERS MAY NEED TO BE UPDATED TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO MEET THEIR GOALS. AS YOU KNOW PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS SUFFERED GREATLY DURING THE LAST ECONOMIC DECLINE AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE JUST BARELY STARTING TO CLIMB THE WAY BACK. UP. STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS NEED THE LEGISLATOR TO CREATE A PROCESS IN WHICH THE MONEY USED FOR TAX CREDITS CAN BE AB VALUE EIGHT FOR THEIR ECONOMIC IMPACT. TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S GETTING OUR RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENT. IF THIS IS NOT DONE HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT THE PAST AND CURRENT. REDUCTIONS EDUCATION FUNDING AS A RESULT OF THESE TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS ARE REALLY WORTH IT. AS AMENDED SB FOR SIXTY WILL CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS TO EXCESS THE FACT IN THIS OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS. ALLOWING FOR THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE WHICH CAN OF WHICH YOU CAN USE TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE COST OF TAX CREDITS AGAINST THE INVESTMENT IN QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION.

MR CHURCH MEMBERS THERESA MAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION FIRST OF ALL WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL AND THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR BEING OPEN TO OUR CONCERNS ABOUT TAXATION ON INNOVATION AND JOB CREATION. ARE WE JUST RECEIVED THE AMENDMENTS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON SO WE HAVE NOT HAD A FULL COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS A A GREAT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE ORIGINAL BILL AS INTRODUCED. AND ALSO WE DO NOT YET HAVE A FORMAL POSITION BUT WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SOME OBSERVATIONS COMMENTS AND CONCERNS. ABOUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. THE FIRST CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO REPRESENTATION ON THE REVIEW BOARD BY BUSINESSES OR EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE BOARD IS TO BE REPRESENTED IN COMPRISE A FIVE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFICE AND THE LEO. THAT BUT THERE IS EXPRESSLY NO REPRESENTATION FROM CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES OR EMPLOYERS. SIMILAR REVIEW COMMITTEES TYPICALLY INCLUDE A REPRESENTATIVE OVER PRESENT MANY OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE STUDY GROUP THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED. WE BELIEVE THAT IF THIS IS TRULY GOING TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. THAT THE BOARD ADD ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW. HOW POLICIES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED? PLEASE ASK FOR THE EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS THE BUSINESS MEN AND WOMEN AND WE SAID WE RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT THEY BE ADDED AND BE GIVEN AN EQUAL VOICE ON THE BOARD. THE SECOND CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS WE SUGGEST INCLUSION OF VARIOUS REVIEW FACTORS. CURRENTLY SECTION FORTY FOUR E. FORTY THREE EXCUSE ME OUTLINES THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY TO BE ENVISIONED AND TO BE COMPLETED AGO LONG WITH THE TIME FRAMES. TO PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE STUDY. BESIDES THIS LOOKING AT THE GENERAL FUND LOSS WE YOU PROPOSE THAT WE SUGGEST A BROADER LOOK AT THE GENERAL FUND IMPACTS IN TOTAL. AND SUGGESTS THAT THE CITY ALSO REPORT ON MULTIPLIER EFFECTS AS SUGGESTED BY THE PEW INSTITUTE. THOSE MULTIPLIER FACTS ARE FACTS THAT HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT THROUGH THE ECONOMY. SPECIFICALLY THOSE FACTORS THE WE SUGGEST THE STUDY LOOK AT INCLUDE NUMBER ONE INCREASED GENERAL FUND REVENUE FROM JOBS. EMPLOYMENT WAGES AND BUSINESS INCOME RELATED TO THESE TAX INCENTIVES. NUMBER TO INCREASE THE LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE FROM BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND HOMEOWNERSHIP WHICH ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION. THIRD TAKE A LOOKING AT A REDUCTION IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AS A GREAT EMPLOYMENT WOULD REDUCE SPENDING AND PRODUCE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS FOR THESE PROGRAMS. AND THESE ARE JUST TO NAME A FEW BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS. THIRDLY WE ALSO SUGGESTS A REVIEW OF OUR COMPETITION. FOR EXAMPLE THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE LISTING A COMPARABLE A COMPARABLE LIST THE FEDERAL CREDIT. BUT WHY NOT ALSO ADDRESS THE COMPETITION THAT WE HAVE AMONG OTHER STATES. WHAT ARE COME IN SENATORS BEING OFFERED BY OTHER STATES HOW DO THEY STACK UP TO OUR INCENTIVES? AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IN THAT REGARD WHAT WILL BE THE LAST OR STATE BOTH IN TERMS OF JOBS AND GENERAL FUND REVENUE IF THESE POLICIES WERE ELIMINATED. AND THOSE JOBS AND EMPLOYMENT WERE TO MOVE TO OTHER STATES ONCE AGAIN THIS IS BASED ON OUR ON OUR VERY PULMONARY VIEW WE HAVE OTHER THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS AND WE'D CONTINUE. TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE AUTHORS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE AMENDMENTS. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE INITIAL THOUGHTS IN WHAT SOME COMMENTS AND AND VERY GRATEFUL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TO REVIEW. SPAGHETTI FORESHORES YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES A MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS MAKAYLA ON BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK. YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND CENTER JACKSON AND HER STAFF THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE PROVISION -- THE I. E. THE AUTOMATIC SUNSET DATE IS OBVIOUSLY REMOVED -- SO THE MOST PROBLEMATIC PROVISION IS A IT IS GONE HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF ISSUES AS AN INITIAL MATTER THE WAY I READ. NEW SECTION FORTY TWO H.. ONE IS IS THAT THAT BILLION DOLLAR FIGURE IS OVER THE LAST TEN FISCAL YEARS RATHER THAN ANNUAL. AND I HEARD ANNUAL IN THE EXPLANATION EARLIER AND I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AN ANNUAL OR A DECADE LONG PERIOD. AND WHICH ITEMS WILL ACTUALLY BE PICKED UP. OUR LIST OF THAT I DON'T THINK THAT GENERALLY MY CLIENT OR GENERALLY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS HAD ANY OBJECTIONS TO THE NOTION OF STUDYING -- TAX EXPENDITURES OBVIOUSLY THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RELEASES AN ANNUAL -- DOCUMENTATION EXPLAINING WHAT THOSE ARE IN THE ESTIMATED FISCAL IMPACT OF THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE WORK WITH SENATOR LANDAU IN THE BILL THAT'S REFERENCED IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT NOW REQUIRES. ALL NEW CREDITS TO BE SUBJECT TO EVALUATION -- METRICS -- CERTAINLY -- THE COMMITTEES IN THE POLICY COMMITTEES IN BOTH HOUSES HAVE LOOKED TO NOT ONLY METRICS FOR NEW TAX EXPENDITURES. BUT ALSO GENERALLY SUNSET DATES AND IN FACT THERE IS PENDING LEGISLATION. CURRENTLY IN THE OTHER HOUSE THAT WOULD CODIFY THOSE COMMITTEE PRACTICES. I THINK ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS. IS IF THERE IS THE STATED CONCERN IS THE AUTHOR INDICATED AND CERTAINLY THE SUPPORTERS ABOUT THE GENERAL FUND IMPACT. AS YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES ON PAGE -- FOUR THE MOST MOST OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. OR ON THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX SIDE NOT ON THE CORPORATE SIDE AND YET IT'S ONLY CORPORATE. TAX EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING TARGETED FOR THIS REVIEW -- SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE THIS STANDALONE INDEPENDENT ENTITY OF THE STATE TO EVALUATE TAX EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND YOUR CONCERN IS THE GENERAL FUND IMPACT. THEN WHY WOULDN'T WE BE LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE. THE OTHER COMMENT I HAVE ALONG THE LINES OF OF WHAT. MISTER MAY INDICATED IS HOW DO WE EVALUATE THESE. QUIPUS MCKAY THERE IS ONE MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE A SECOND -- DOES WHATEVER IT DOES MANAGE WHERE TO GO FOR MINUTES WITH YOU SIR I'LL TRY NOT TO IT YET. THREE YOUR BOSS TWO MINUTES IN WHICH OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE THE FULL FOUR MINUTES TO BE ABLE TO TEST AND I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING SIR THE FORMS OR WHAT. A LOT OF THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS CONTEXT IS THE NOTION OF AN INCENTIVE YOU KNOW CREDITS EXEMPTIONS DEDUCTIONS EXCLUSIONS. BUT A LOT OF THE CERTAINLY ON THE CORPORATE SIDE EVEN MANY ON THE PIT SIDE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH AN INCENTIVE EVALUATION. AND I WANT TO JUST TACKLE A COUPLE OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE ON THIS LIST FOR EVALUATION ONLY ON THE CORPORATE SIDE. BUT TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IN OTHER WORDS ARE INDEED TAX CREDIT IS AN APPROPRIATE EVALUATION OF IS IT HAVING AN INCENTIVE EFFECT. OF COURSE I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES IT WAS EVALUATED BECAUSE IT WAS SUBJECT TO A SUNSET DATE AND THIS LEGISLATE THAT PRIOR LEGISLATURE'S OBVIOUSLY. DECIDED TO MAKE THAT PERMANENT IN LEGISLATION -- INITIALLY PROPOSED BY CENTER ALPERT AND THEN CODIFIED IN A IN AN ALL QUESTS BILL. SIMILARLY -- A LOT OF THESE PROVISIONS ARE BASED UPON FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY THE E. SOPS THE LIGHT KIND EXCHANGES EVEN THE SUB CHAPTER S. IN THE OUR INDIE CREDIT ALTHOUGH WE MAKE SOME TWEAKS TO IT. NOT EVERYTHING IS AN INCENTIVE I OFTEN JOKINGLY SAY WE HAVE A CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT. IT'S NOT AN INCENTIVE FOR ADDITIONAL CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT TAX PAYERS HAVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND SO WE PROVIDE A TAX BENEFIT. BUT RECOGNIZING THOSE EXPENSES. THE SUB CHAPTER S. CORPORATIONS IS NOT A TAX BREAK. IT'S A SEPARATE FORM OF ENTITY RATHER THAN THE C. COURT. AND IT'S A IT'S TREATED AS A PASS THROUGH ENTITY JUST LIKE UNDER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF COURSE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HAVE AN ENTITY LEVEL TAX OF ONE AND A HALF PERCENT. ARE WE GOING TO EVALUATE THE FACT THAT IT'S IN FEDERAL CONFORMITY. WHAT ABOUT THE WATER'S EDGE ELECTION WHAT LED TO THE WATER'S EDGE ELECTION AND SENATE BILL EIGHTY FIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS? THE THREAT OF AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE WAR WITH THE THE GOVERNMENTS OF JAPAN AND GREAT BRITAIN FOR EXAMPLE AND WE ALLOW THAT -- ELECTION OTHERWISE YOU'RE SUBJECT TO MANDATORY WORLDWIDE COMBINED REPORTING IS THAT GONNA BE EVALUATED PROPERLY. I MEAN WE CAN GO THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFERENT ITEMS BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS AN INCENTIVE FOR A JOB CREATORS SUMMER PEER CONFORMITY SOME HAVE OTHER TAX POLICY REASONS. AND THAT RATIONALE HAS TO BE FULLY EVALUATED -- INSIDE IN THIS TYPE OF AN ORGANIZATION AND I HOPE THAT'S ACCOMPLISHED THAT EVERYTHING IS NOT VIEWED AS DID IT CREATE A NEW JOB FOR EXAMPLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SPECULATE. I'M SO THE WAY WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO RUN THIS IS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AFTER WE HEAR THOSE WHO OPPOSE. COME BACK UP AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO IT REVIEWS OPPOSE STAY WITH US SO IT COULD BE MISS TO MAY COMMENCEMENT KAYLEE Y'ALL CAN DECIDE WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU. SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE GOING TO THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED IF YOU GIVE US YOUR FIRST AND LAST AN ORGANIZATION WE WELCOME YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR BUT WITH CAL CHAMBER JUST WANT TO SAY WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DIRECTION THIS BILL'S GOING AND THANK THE COMMITTEE IN THAT -- AUTHOR FOR THAT -- WHEN THE AMENDMENTS APPEAR IN PRINT WILL BE REMOVING OUR JOB KILLER STATUS?

WOULD LIKE TO BE A DO NOT A LAST CALL LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. HEARING SEE NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE BEFORE WE GO TO COMMITTEE WE'D LIKE TO GOING TO TURN OVER TO SENATOR JACKSON'S -- ON ANY RESPONSE YOU HAVE MA'AM AND THEN WE'D LIKE TO BETTER TURNED OVER TO THE SENATOR AS A COMMITTEE MUCH APPRECIATED -- THE YOU KNOW OF I AM VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS. AND SO WILL CERTAINLY MAKE SURE -- AS WE GO FORWARD THAT THE BUSINESS CONCERNS AND INTERESTS THAT HAVE ARTICULATED THERE THE THOSE CONCERNS HERE TODAY -- WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT THEIR VIEWS THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THEM WORKING -- REDUCING ALLERGY WITH A GIVE A CPA WHO TALKS TO THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT. PARTS OF A OF AN ENTITY AND IT KNOWS HOW TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND KNOWS HOW TO DO THE ANALYSIS AND BRINGS THAT. ANALYSIS FORWARD -- SO THAT THE EXPERTS CA TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND PRIORITIZE WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF WHAT THE VALUES ARE THAT'S WHY WE CALL FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION -- SO WE ARE -- CERTAINLY -- NOT ATTEMPTING TO PUT THE THUMB ON ANYTHING HERE -- THE SCALES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE -- FOR AND THIS PASSIONATE -- WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE HOPING TO LOOK AT ALL THE FACTORS AND SO INPUT FROM THESE VERY STAKEHOLDERS THIS. IS OF COURSE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO ACCURATELY ASSESS THE VALUE OF THEIR TAX EXPENDITURES TO OUR STATE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING -- FOR THERE ISN'T ANY -- CRITERIA THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT LIMITED TO THE INCENTIVE ASPECT THERE ARE LOTS OF ASPECTS -- FOR THESE TAX -- CREDITS AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND AND WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE MALL -- I THINK THE ISSUE THE FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY IS A GOOD ONE BECAUSE WHAT WAS UNDER TWO FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY TWENTY YEARS AGO MAY NOT BE WHAT FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY IS TODAY. AND SO WE MAY WANT -- TO AS WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS -- RECOGNIZE WHAT THE TAX LAWS ARE TODAY AND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEM MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING THEM. AND THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THIS KIND OF PROCESS -- THERE WAS A STATEMENT TO ABOUT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DOING AND ANALYSIS. THEY THEY ACTUALLY DON'T DO AN ANALYSIS PER SE THEY THEY ACTUALLY TO STATE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT IS LOST BY THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO WE WILL AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE'VE INVITED OR THAT THIS INCLUDES A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT -- EXPERTS THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DO THIS AND TO BE OBJECTIVE IN THAT WORK SO -- BASICALLY I I YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THE CONCERNS ARE ARE LEGITIMATE I I'M CERTAINLY -- ANXIOUS FOR US TO KEEP WORKING WITH THEM BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT HERE'S AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S WORKING WHAT ISN'T WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER -- IF WE CAN AND CERTAINLY -- AGAIN HAVEN'T TO BE OBJECTIVE AND NONPARTISAN AND DISPASSIONATE BECAUSE TAX DOLLARS ARE TAX DOLLARS WHETHER THEY COME FROM REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS ARE DECLINE TO STATE. A IT'S THE TAX ISSUE HERE IT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING IS IT GOING FOR THE FOR A GOOD PURPOSE AND THEN WE BRING IT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. AFTER ALL THE INFORMATION IS BEING. COMPLETED. BECAUSE MY CENTER THE TO PUT IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER VICE CHAIR WILL KICK US OFF AND WE'LL GO TO OTHER SENATORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S -- A FAIR ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS ALL GOOD -- I'M JUST CURIOUS ARE ON A FEW LITTLE AREAS. IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUPPORT STAFF WILL BE THE LA -- THAT WOULD KIND OF BE PART OF THE STRUCTURE IN AND I'M I'M. AND DO WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO BE VERY -- HELPFUL IN ASSISTING THE LA YOURS I JUST ASSUMED. WELL I THINK THAT'S PART I MEAN IT'S UP TO DISCUSSION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE THE THE RIGHT INFORMATION THE ACCURATE INFORMATION. THAT GIVES AS MUCH DATA. TO THIS STAKEHOLDER GROUP -- OR I SHOULD SAY TO THESE EXPERTS -- WE DO KNOW THE LA -- HAS DONE THESE BEFORE -- OF THE NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE A GOOD SUBMITTING THIS TO A RATHER INTENSE AND I THINK FAIRLY -- EXPERT GROUP TO TO DO THAT ANALYSIS FOR US OR TO DO THE SORT OF THE FACT FINDING AND HOLD THESE HEARINGS. FOR THE PUBLIC -- AND THEN PRESENTING A RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT'S IT'S SORT OF A THREE TIERED PROCESS. AND THE LA -- STARTS TO WORK CASH TO WORK WITH THIS BOARD OF THESE FIVE DIFFERENT GROUPS THE BOARD THEN HAS TO GOOUT AND HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS. THEY COME BACK TOGETHER THE ISSUE A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN THE LEDGER LEGISLATURE GOES FROM THERE. IN THE OTHER ITEM I I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE IN THERE -- UNDER AT FORTY THREE D. THE NAME IS ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY MUST ASSIST THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. RIGHT TO COMPLETE ITS COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE MAJOR TAX EXPENDITURE TO THE MAXIMUM DEGREE PRACTICE SO. LONG STORY SHORT THAT WOULD MEAN IN THE ALLEY -- WILL BE CONSULTING ALL RELEVANT AGENCIES -- TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST IN THIS EVALUATION BECAUSE IN NEED TO BE COMPREHENSIVE -- IN LOOKING. AN EXHAUSTIVE WAY ACROSS ALL ASPECTS STATE GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YES -- SENATOR THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION TO ADD MEMBERS TO THE COMMITTEE -- ARE YOU WAS GOING TO JUST USE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AS A A PLACE HOLDER FOR THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OR OTHER. GROUPS. WELL I THINK AT THIS POINT AND WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WE YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE THE CHAMBER THEN WE'VE GOT TO HAVE LABOR IF WE HAVE THIS WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT -- THE GOAL HERE IS TO BRING THE FISCAL EXPERTS TO THE TABLE HAVE THEM DO THE INVESTIGATION THROUGH ALL DEPARTMENTS TO GET ALL OF THE INFORMATION. AS FACTORED AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE TO BRING IT TOGETHER AND TO OF FORMULATE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED UPON THE NUMBERS IF YOU WILL TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS THE POLICY MAKING BODY. AND THEN OF COURSE THEY'LL BE THOSE LAYERS OF DISCUSSION ABOUT PRIORITIES AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THE DATA HAS TO BE THERE. AND FOR AND THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL IS OF THESE GROUPS IS TO GET THE DATA MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE LA OR DEPARTMENT FINANCER FRENCH I SEXUAL WHOEVER IT IS. WILL BE REACHING OUT TO THE VARIOUS ENTITIES TO LABOR TO THE CHAMBER TO ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS FOR THAT INFORMATION FROM THEM AND BRING IT BACK INTO THE REPORT ITSELF. THE IDEA OF PROVIDING COMPARED AS WITH OTHER STATES KIND OF A BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES -- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE ENCOURAGED OR DO WE NEED TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT I I THINK I THINK IT'S AGAIN SOMETHING WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON BECAUSE AGAIN. IF WE ARE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA TAKE TAKE THE MOVIE TAX CREDIT CLEARLY WE DO THAT IN PART BECAUSE IF WE DON'T PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT THE THEN THE INDUSTRY IS MOVING ELSEWHERE GEORGE'S BECOME VERY ATTRACTIVE I THINK FLORIDA I THINK. OTHER PLACES SO WE HAVE TO DO SOME KIND OF COMPARISON TO JUSTIFY THAT TAX CREDIT WHICH BY THE WAY WE DO NOW ANNUALLY SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'M EXPECTING IS THAT WILL LOOK AT WHAT THE LITTLE BILL. CALLED FOR WHICH IS ESTABLISHING METRICS AND THEIR SUNSETS ON EVERY TAX CREDIT WE'VE GIVEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HAS TO MEET UP TO CERTAIN MEASUREMENTS IN ORDER FOR IT TO JUSTIFY ITS EXISTENCE GOING FORWARD. THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T HAVE THAT FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FILL THAT GAP BUT DO IT OBJECTIVELY. DO IT BECAUSE IF IT'S HELPING THE STATE IF IT'S BENEFITING THE TAXPAYER FITS PER IF IT'S SERVING SOME PUBLIC POLICY. THEN WE WANT TO KEEP IT SO IT'S JUST BASICALLY A ME TRYING TO GO BACK -- AND GET THE SAME ANSWERS THAT WE NOW REQUIRE AS WE DO TAX CREDITS GOING FORWARD IT'S NOT OUR MONEY IT'S THE TAXPAYERS MONEY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S BEING SPENT PROPERLY. TODAY WE WE'VE GONE OVER A BUNCH OF NEW PROS CREDITS MAYBE EXPANDED RENTER'S CREDIT -- ENTERPRISE ZONES TO SECTION EIGHT CREDITS ALL KINDS OF GREAT IDEAS -- BUT YOU'RE ONLY LIMITING THIS TO CORPORATE RELATED. AT THIS POINT TIME THAT'S WHERE WE'RE STARTING WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT THE A TOTAL IS ABOUT SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS THAT HAVE GONE IN THESE TAX CREDITS -- I BELIEVE -- OR IS IT SIXTY SIX BILLION ANNUALLY FOR ALL OF THESE TAX CREDITS THE ONES WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE. ARE ABOUT SIX POINT SOMETHING BILLION A YEAR -- TO THAT -- ARE A DOLLAR SHOULD DON'T COME INTO THE STATE. MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T I MEAN THAT'S THE QUESTION IS SHOULD THEY OR SHOULDN'T THING AND WE DON'T KNOW. AND THAT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME AND I SUSPECT IT'S FRUSTRATING TO DEAL WITH GOD INDIVIDUALS THAT FILE THIRD TEN FORTY IS AN EVER SCHEDULE SEE THEY'RE NOT INCORPORATED. BUT THEY QUALIFY. FOR TAX CREDITS OF A BUSINESS NATURE SO I'M JUST. KIND OF WONDERING. HOW DO WE? WELL WE STARTED WITH THESE NINE BECAUSE THEY WERE. SHE'S ME BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT -- UP TO I THINK IT'S A BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OF TAX CREDITS AND AGAIN -- WITH THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY WE WE CAN'T DO MORE GOING FORWARD BUT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED NINE THAT REPRESENT THE THE LARGEST -- I BELIEVE CORPORATE TAX CREDITS THAT WE GIVE AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M FOCUSING ON HERE WITH THE BILL. WE SEE THAT IT'S BENEFICIAL AND THAT IT'S WORKING WELL WE MAY WANT TO ADD ON ADDITIONAL TAX CREDITS BUT WE FELT THAT -- LET'S START WITH THESE -- BECAUSE THEY DO REP REFLECT BILLION DOLLARS YEAR MORE THAT WHICH MONEY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND. AND LET'S SEE WHETHER LET'S SEE HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS AND GO FROM THERE. OLD THE DATA YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT IS BASED ON STATIC INFORMATION -- SO MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID YOU HAD TO SPEND A DIME TO MAKE A QUARTER. AND SO SOME OF THESE INCENTIVES OR CREDITS ARE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE MORE ACTIVITY ABSOLUTELY I WOULD SAY MAYBE THE REAGAN TAX CUT GENERATED MORE REVENUES YOU MIGHT HAVE A TAX RATE DECREASE BUT IT. REVENUE INCREASE -- SO I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS TO READ. YOU KNOW IS IS THE LA -- GONNA BE DOING MODELING OR WE JUST LOOKING AT JUST HARD DATA AND THEN. GO FROM THERE. I THINK THAT -- AGE WOULD BE OPEN TO THE INTERPRETATION LA -- I CAN'T IMAGINE AS THROUGH IS THE ELIO IS CURRENTLY AND YOU'RE TRYING TO BECOME EVEN MORE ROBUST THEY ACTUALLY WOULDN'T DO THE MODELING -- THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AS WELL CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT AT THE MOMENT BUT COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE AS THOROUGH A REVIEW. TO THE LEGISLATURE IS POSSIBLE I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE WE HAVE A COUPLE SENATORS HERE AT THE MOMENT. WE ARE GOING TO LOSE -- NEVER SENATOR HERE ABOUT. TWELVE THIRTY SO I JUST WANTED JUST. TAKE NOTE OF THAT AND THIS TO ME WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE THAT HAVE A QUICK COMMENT AS WELL SO THIS ONE MAKE SURE BUT MISTER VICE CHAIR THE FORCE OR SPRING RESEARCHER I HAVE BEEN HERE ALL DAY. SO IT'S A FROM LIFE -- THOUGHT CLOSE WITH THIS QUESTION. MR MAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO REACT TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS I DIRECTED TO THE SENATOR. YES FIRST OF ALL THE FTV TYPICALLY PROVIDES JUST THE DATA BUT NOT AN ANALYSIS ON THAT DATE IS TYPICALLY USE BUT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN THEY PREPARE THEIR TAX EXPENDITURE REPORT -- ONE IMPORTANT POINT TO CLARIFY IS THE THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE BUT ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS OPTIONAL IT. PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR PUBLIC INPUT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT BUSINESSES NEED A STAKE IN THAT AND NEED AN EQUAL VOICE ON THE BOARD SO HAVING A REPRESENTATIVE OR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. TO TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFIC AND HAVING FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE ABOUT HOW THESE TAX INCENTIVES WORK. IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT CRITICAL TO THE EXCESS THE SUCCESS OF THE QUALITY OF THE DATA TO BE USED FOR THE EVALUATION -- SECONDLY I'D LIKE TO RE EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT THE PEW RESEARCH FOCUSES ON ONLY TAX INCENTIVES THAT MEANS EXEMPTIONS DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS. THIS BILL GOES OR THE PROPOSAL GOES MUCH BROADER INTO THAT WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WATER'S EDGE EXEMPTION THE POLICY BEHIND THAT IS TO NOT TAX INCOME. THAT WAS NOT EARNED IN THE U. S. WAS NOT PRODUCING U. S. AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE U. S. SO HOW DO YOU EVALUATE OR HOW DO YOU PUT. PERFORMANCE METRICS ON THAT MADE THE GOAL IS. TO TAX INCOME THAT'S EARNED WITHIN THE COUNTRY SO YOU KNOW. TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN FACTORS THAT ARE NOT INCENTIVES NOT EXPENDITURES NOT CREDITS DEDUCTIONS. GIVES YOU A MORE QUALITATIVE DATA KNOW A BETTER MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET ACT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MISS TAYLOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE A AND I'M QUICKLY. VERY VERY BRIEFLY AGAIN JENNIFER BAKER THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- THE DILEMMA THAT WE DO HAVE IS IF WE BEGIN TO ADD ON OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IT'S EASY FOR C. T. AID ALSO OUT FOR SEATED THE TABLE IS 40% OF THE REVENUES THAT WE'D BE DISCUSSING WOULD ACTUALLY BE REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE GONE TO PUBLIC EDUCATION. SO -- KEEPING THE BOARD OBJECTIVE IN A MANNER THAT IS CURRENTLY -- PROPOSED TO MOVE FOR WOULD BE THE MOST OBJECTIVE MATTER IN DOING SO WE WOULD USUALLY ADD THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF TAX ITEM SOME OF THE ITEMS AS A REFERENCE THAT ARE ANTI. HAVEN'T BEEN EVALUATED FOR THE NINETIES IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD THAN IT WAS IN THE NINETIES TO QUE JAPAN'S ECONOMY AND POPULATION IS CERTAINLY NOT THE SAME TODAY AS IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO. BRITAIN ITSELF IS HAVING SOME COLORFUL ISSUES WITH BREXIT AND SO THIS IS A VERY OPPORTUNE TIME WITH THE CHANGING ECONOMY IN CHANGING WORLD TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS LEGISLATURE SEAL OF APPROVAL ON FILE OF THE ITEMS. THAT NEED TO JUST BE REVIEWED YOU CAN SPEAKER RENAMED HER MISS TAYLOR AND I APOLOGIZE SO -- I'D SO SERVICE BAKER PLEASE MISS RUSSIA REJECTED CLOSER MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON SERIOUSNESS CENTER BELL HAVE -- I HAVE SOME QUICK CLOSING COMMENTS IN WHICH I TURN OVER TO THE GOOD CENTER FOR SANTA BARBARA WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF. THERE NIELSEN OR CENTER ABOUT INCOMES. ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT WITH THE MOTION OF THE FOUR BY CENTER BELL I ENTERED OVER TO CENTER JACKSON MOMENTARILY. LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION THIS LEGISLATURE FOR MANY MANY YEARS WELL PROCEED MY TIME. TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE A PROCESS THAT IS TRANSPARENT [inaudible] DATA DRIVEN. I IN IMPLEMENTS OVERSIGHT AND REVIEW. AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE AT THE TABLE. I WHICH IS. REASON WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE MADE UP OF BOTH -- BUSINESS AND I DON'T OVERSIMPLIFY BY THE WAY RIGHT BUSINESS LABOR AND TAXPAYERS. END I I THINK THAT THERE WERE SOME. IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP. AS FAR AS THE EVALUATION TECHNIQUES. ONE I THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT IT'S NOT THIS BILL SOMETHING TO CONSIDER LATER -- THE INCREASE OF PROPERTY TAX. I THINK THAT ABSOLUTELY MAKES SENSE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE REVIEWING -- AS ONE OF THOSE TRIGGERS THAT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD I STUDY END. OUT WHAT IS THAT POTENTIAL. POSITIVE HATE TO THE GENERAL FUND FROM THE AT TAX CREDIT AS WELL I THINK THAT ALSO MAKES SENSE I BROUGHT UP -- I THINK% THAT WE GO DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE. OUT WHEN WE START WANTING TO BE ABLE TO ADD NINE STATE AGENCY MEMBERS -- BECAUSE WHERE DOES THAT STOP [inaudible] BOB. THAT SAID I THINK WE WILL BE RIGHT AND I DON'T EVERYONE SPEAK FROM THE GOOD CENTER FOR SANTA BARBARA BUT OPEN HAVE A CONVERSATION BUT I JUST WANNA. FLAG IT AT THAT IT COULD BE A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO BE A FOCUS ON THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BEEF UP THEIR ROLE IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL I THINK THE OTHER IMPORTANT PART OF ALL THIS. IS THAT THESE WOULD BE OPEN MEETINGS THAT WHERE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE ABLE TO COME SPEAK IN OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO HAVE. THOSE MEETINGS AT ONE ON ONE WITH THAT POTENTIAL MEMBERS. AGAIN I THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL -- FOCUS ON THIS IN THE MONTHS TO COME AND I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR AND TO THOSE WHO WERE IN SUPPORT. OUR STATE THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO -- OR OPPOSE OR HAVE CONCERNS EXACERBATING THAT THEY BROUGHT UP SOME GOOD POINTS AND OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL CONTINUE. TO BE A GREATER DISCUSSION AS A SENATOR MOVES THE BILL FOR THE ONES WHO THINK IT ALL SITES THAN SENATOR I'M SORRY YEP DANCE ALONG THE FLOOR IS YOURS ARE GOING TO WRITE I APPRECIATED I'M. MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS WE KNOW THE LA -- KNOWS HOW TO DO ITS JOB AND WILL SEEK OUT THE VIEWS FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- AS YOU MENTION THEIR OPEN SO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR INPUT DURING THE PROCESS. THAT INPUT THEN WILL BE REFLECTED IN A REPORT IT WILL COME TO THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HEAR ALL DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND POINTS OF VIEW BUT IT WEEK WE CAN'T DO NOTHING HERE WE HAVE -- ENORMOUS -- IT -- TAX. OF CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CREDITS ABOUT WHICH WE KNOW NOTHING AND THIS IS JUST TO TRY TO GET SOME SUNSHINE SOME OVERSIGHT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE TO BE DONE WE STARTED HERE AGAIN FOR THE REASONS I MENTIONED LET'S PUT TOGETHER THIS IS PUTTING TOGETHER A PROCESS. AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING THAT. RATE THE THE GOOD WORK FROM THE THE SENATOR FROM THE GREAT NORTH AND THE STAFF ON THIS -- AGAIN THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES THAT ARE AHEAD OF US IN THIS PROCESS I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE TAXPAYER -- AND CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW IF THESE TAX CREDITS ARE DOING WHAT WE EXPECTED THEM TO DO AND ARE SERVING THEIR PURPOSE AND THEN WE SHOULD CONTINUE THEM. THE AYE. AYE MAKE GNOSTIC ON EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO AND IF THEY'RE NOT -- EITHER WE ADJUST OR WE REMOVE THEM -- OR IF WE NEED TO EXPAND THEM WE DO THAT BUT WE NEED THE DATA AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU SO MUCH. SENATE JACKSON IN ONE ITEM THAT I DIDN'T MISS IT IS THAT I KNOW THAT MISTER MCKINLEY AIDE VANCE WAS AN ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE OF THE DECADE CURRENTLY AS IT READS WITHIN THE MEN MEANT. IT IS GREATER THAN ONE BILLION OVER THE DECADE THAT'S AN ITEM THAT WE CAN ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT IS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THE IN THE ORIGINAL FORM. IS FOCUSING ON THE ANNUAL BUT THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON AND I APPRECIATE. THE FLAG ON THAT WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR BELL THE MOTION IS DO PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THIS LANCASTER CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HI WHY I'M MORE LOCK. GOD GO.

AGI LIMITATION WHICH WILL BE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR INDIVIDUAL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A MARRIED COUPLE SENATE BILL SEVEN FOUR SEVEN SEVEN WOULD PROVIDE A STUDENT LOAN TAX CREDIT OF UP TO A THOUSAND THOUSAND DOLLARS ADVENTURES. FOR A PERSON PAID ON THEIR STUDENT LOAN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS NOW SECOND THE SECOND HIGHEST CATEGORY ONLY -- TO MORTGAGES AND HOUSEHOLD DEBT UNITED STATES WITH SOME SOMEWHERE CLOSE. TO FORTY FIVE MILLION BORROWERS COLLECTIVELY OWING ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS GREATER INVOLVED THAT CREDIT CARD AND ON A LOAN DEBT THIS DEBT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY WOMEN. BY WOMEN BY STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILY BY STUDENTS OF COLOR AND FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS THE BURDEN OF THESE LOANS HAS RESULTED IN A GENERATION POSTPONING THE TRADITIONAL LIFE MILESTONES LIKE. BUYING A HOME GETTING MARRIED STARTING A FAMILY AND SAVING FOR RETIREMENT THE PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION ADVANCED DEGREES IS HIGHLY ENCOURAGED IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT WHILE THE AVERAGE STUDENT LOAN DEBT HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY INCOME HAS NOT KEPT PACE BY. PROVIDING THIS CREDIT -- THE WE THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THE COST THE CALIFORNIA SEVEN KERR TO PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION IT'S A MEASURE OF SMALL RELIEF WITH ME I HAVE LERI DOLE AND CHRISTOPHER LONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE.

AND I WILL SEE DAHLE FURTHER TIME -- TO CHRISTOPHER LONG WHO'S A DELEGATE FROM THE BAR ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO OF THE CONFERENCE.

THAT THEY FACE WITH THE SPELL OR DO WE WANT TO STAND BY AND WATCH THESE YOUNG MINDS LEAVE FOR HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE ELSEWHERE. DUE TO THE CRUSHING COMBINATION OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA'S HIGH COST OF LIVING. AND THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS SENATOR BALLOT KNOWLEDGE EVEN EARLIER THIS MORNING. THIS BILL PROVIDES A SOLUTION BREAKS FROM THE CURRENT COOKIE CUTTER NATIONWIDE MODEL THAT APPLIES FROM THE IRS -- EQUALLY TO SOMEONE LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO AS IT DOES TO INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN NEBRASKA OR TAXES JUST AS EXAMPLES. THE STUDENT LOAN CRISIS IS WELL KNOWN AND I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR HERE BUT TOTAL DEBT HAS GROWN ONE HUNDRED AND 57% IN JUST THE LAST TWELVE YEARS.

MORNING Và AFTERNOON NOW CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M PRESENTING AS BE SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH WILL ENABLE MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES TO APPLY. FOR CERTAIN GRANTS FROM THE STATE BY CONFORMING TORE FEDERAL INCOME TAX LOSS FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THINK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SOUGHT. LOCATE ON PEACH FOR THE ANALYSIS CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE FEDERAL FIVE OH ONE C.. TWELVE TAX EXEMPT STATUS OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES AND THEREFORE THE RESIDENTS IMAGE WATER COMPANIES AND EFFECTS ARE TAXED TWICE -- SO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD MAINTAINS A DATABASE SYSTEM SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT NEED HELP COMPLY WITH SAFE DRINKING WATER REGULATIONS THROUGH GRANTS AND CONSOLIDATIONS. 80% OF THE SYSTEMS LISTED ARE SMARMY TO WATER COMPANIES THE REALITY IS THAT MANY MUTUAL WATER COMPANY SERVE AREAS THAT ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED FROM LARGER PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND MOUNTAINS AREAS AS WELL AS THE STATE DESERT. OR WATER SERVICES ARE NONE THE LESS ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BUT SOMETIMES DIFFICULT -- TO CONNECT TO BETWEEN SYSTEMS THERE ARE OTHER BE TO WATER COMPANIES OWNED BY CITIES AS WELL THAT SHARE IN THE COST OF OPERATING OUT ONE IN PARTICULAR IS IN MY DISTRICT IN THAT INCLUDES COVINA. THEN THE HUBBUB LE BRAT AND MANY OTHERS IN CENTRAL CLOSE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- WITH THAT AGAIN I'M AN ASKED OUT MY WITNESSES TO EXPEDITED SO YOU CAN GET TO IT WILL BE VERY FAST -- YOU'RE YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GOOD CAN RUBIO THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WELCOME YOU SIRTO COMMITTEE IN TWO MINUTES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO FOR INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION MY NAME IS THAT I DON'T THINK I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES. AN OFFICER OF THE CAL MUTUALS BOARD EVEN THE CALCULUS HERE WITH ME AS WELL -- I'M GONNA CUT TO THE CHASE ON WHY WE NEED THIS LEGISLATION URGENTLY -- WE BECAME ELIGIBLE IS MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES FOR GRANTS UNDER PROP ONE INTEGER PROP SIXTY EIGHT OF THOSE LAWS BASICALLY REQUIRED THAT YOU PROVE THAT YOU'RE A NONPROFIT -- THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY DONE IS THAT YOU'RE FORCED TO APPLY AS A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THIS IS KIND OF GONE HAYWIRE. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE VALLEY -- FIVE THE VALLEY FIRE DESTROYED INFRASTRUCTURE AND OVER A DOZEN PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IN LAKE COUNTY. THERE'S MUTUAL WATER COMPANY THERE THAT IN TRYING -- TO PROVE ITS TAX EXEMPTION -- AND IF IT EXCEPT STATE FUNDING -- MUST ALSO ADOPT INDIVIDUAL METERS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ACCEPTING THE STATE FUNDING ONCE IT'S IT ADOPTS THE METERING CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S CONSERVATION POLICIES. IT WILL LOSE ITS TAX EXEMPTION -- SO THE WATER SYSTEM IS CONSIDERING DISSOLUTION -- BECAUSE ANY STATE GRANT FUNDING IT RECEIVES WILL BE TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME AND IT CANNOT AFFORD TAX LIABILITY. SO IN THE NAME OF RECONSTUCTING THAT SYSTEM AND IN THE NAME OF EVERYTHING LEGISLATURE IS DOING RIGHT NOW TO ADDRESS THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER -- FOR EVERYBODY IN THE STATE -- WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU MR EXECUTIVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HANGING WITH US WE'RE GRATEFUL.

THE PROVIDER THEN THE PROVIDERS IN REMIT THE APPICABLE SALES TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED A 10% REDUCTION REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR MEDICAL SUPPLIES. THAT WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED UNTIL THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN DUE TO A COURT INJUNCTION.
