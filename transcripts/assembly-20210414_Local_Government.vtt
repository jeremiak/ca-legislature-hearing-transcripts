01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:01.042
MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT BECAUSE

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:03.611
ONE I FEEL- THAT IN THIS

01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:06.081
COUNTRY. A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.515
IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:09.617
INDICATIONS WE HAVE ABOUT THE

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:11.586
WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND ELECTED

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:15.256
OFFICIALS HAVE THE OBLIGATION

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:15.857
TO REPRESENT THAT WILL OF THE

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.959
PEOPLE. ON THE OTHER HAND MY

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:19.961
CITY HAS STRUGGLED FOR YEARS.

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:22.163
ON THE ISSUE OF DOES OUR BALLOT

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:24.833
IT IT DOES OUR PROP PROP A

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.568
CONFLICT WITH STATE LAW HCD

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.436
SAYS IT DOES. WE SAID IT

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.105
DOESN'T WE GO BACK AND FORTH

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:30.972
AND BACK AND FORTH BACK AND

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:33.174
FORTH. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR

01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:34.576
FIVE YEARS NOW. SO THE GOOD

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:35.744
THING ABOUT THIS BILL THAT

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:36.311
WOULD GIVE A QUICKER

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:38.580
RESOLUTION. THE PROBLEM THAT I

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:39.748
SEE WITH THIS BUT I DON'T KNOW

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.750
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS.

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:42.851
IS YOUR REQUIRING A LOCAL

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:46.421
COUNCIL TO MAKE AN AFFIRMATION

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:47.822
THAT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:50.792
VIOLATE STATE LAW. MANY SMALLER

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:51.993
CITIES ARE NOT TO BE IN THE

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.294
POSITION TO MAKE THAT

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.029
AFFIRMATION IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE

01:23:55.096 --> 01:23:57.198
TO HIRE VERY EXPENSIVE LAWYERS.

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:59.534
INTO IF THEY'RE UP HOLDING THE

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.536
WILL OF THE PEOPLE THEN THE

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.371
FINDING THAT. THE WILL OF THE

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:04.572
PEOPLE IS IN VIOLATION OF STATE

01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:06.307
LAW IS IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.376
DUTY AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL TO

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:10.011
UPHOLD THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:12.414
SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT A

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.216
BETTER. RESOLUTION OF THIS IS

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.451
THAT THE COUNCIL CAN PASS A

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:18.086
RESOLUTION THAT SAYS IT'S A

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:19.888
VIOLATION AND- IT'S IN CONFLICT

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:23.057
WITH STATE LAW. OR NOT IN

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.659
CONFLICT WITH STATE LAW.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.127
BECAUSE REALLY CITIES DON'T

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:27.362
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:28.797
THE CONFLICT IT'S YOU KNOW IN

01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:30.932
STATE LAW. SO IT WOULD BE

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.267
BETTER I MEAN THE BEST

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.235
SITUATION WOULD BE IS IF. THERE

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:35.336
COULD BE SOMETHING WHERE THE

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.872
CITY SAYS I'M NOT SURE IF THIS

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.774
IS A VIOLATION OF STATE LAW.

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:41.509
COULD THE COURTS CLARIFIED AND

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:42.343
THERE COULD BE AN EXPEDITED

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.179
CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THEN THAT

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:46.014
PUTS THE COUNCIL IN A POSITION

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.115
WHERE GETS CLARIFIED IN THE

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:48.850
COURT. AND THE COUNCIL CAN

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.185
STILL UPHOLD THE WILL OF THE

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.687
PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME GET THE

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:53.988
CLARIFICATION SO THERE'S NOT I

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.256
MEAN I CAN'T I CAN'T TELL YOU

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:56.257
THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:57.425
LEGAL FEES MY CITY IS GOING

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:58.493
THROUGH. TRYING TO GET THIS

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.228
CLARIFIED AND STILL THERE'S NO

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:01.563
JUDICIAL RULING ON WHETHER OR

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:04.165
NOT PROP THEY IS OR IS NOT IN

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:05.467
VIOLATION OF STATE LAW IN MY

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.869
CITY. SO ON THE ONE HAND I

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:08.770
WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT THIS BUT

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:10.004
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.673
BECAUSE IT'SAN OPTIMIZER. I

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.141
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:17.745
RARE CASE THAT A COUNCIL SAY.

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:18.346
THE WILL OF MY PEOPLE VIOLATE

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:19.247
STATE LAW THAT'S LIKE US.

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:19.814
STRANGE THING TO DO AND I'M

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:21.216
HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.817
TO TAKE. A CONSIDER SOME

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:24.853

01:25:24.919 --> 01:25:27.622

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.187
BUILD SHARED PARKING

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:54.188
PARTICULARLY COMMERCIAL

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:56.524
DEVELOPERS. THEY ALSO FOUND

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:58.059
THAT A LOT HUNDREDS AND

01:29:58.126 --> 01:29:59.527
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF NEW

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:01.429
HOUSING UNITS WERE PRODUCED.

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:02.697
PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS AND

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.332
LOW INCOME PEOPLE WITH LESS

01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:05.032
PARKING THAT WOULD HAVE

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:06.868
OTHERWISE BEEN. REQUIRED AND

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:10.271
YET WITH ENOUGH PARKING TO

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:11.405
PROVIDE FOR THOSE RESIDENTS. SO

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:12.440
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THAT

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:13.975
WITH IN AREAS THAT ARE IN HIGH

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.277
QUALITY TRANSIT DISTRICTS. IT

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:17.311
WOULD SAY THAT IT'S UP TO

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:19.213
DEVELOPERS TO RIGHT SIZE THE

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.348
AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT THEY

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:21.983
PROVIDE FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:23.518
THAT CITIES CAN NO LONGER

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:26.687
ARBITRARILY- AND UNEVENLY

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.356
DECLARE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:30.725
PARKING FOR THOSE. FOR THOSE-

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:33.928
NEW DEVELOPMENTS. A CROSS

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:36.130
CALIFORNIA IT RANGES FROM A

01:30:36.197 --> 01:30:37.665
CITIES THAT WILL REQUIRE WATER

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:38.766
ONE AND A HALF SPACES PER

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:40.268
HOUSING UNIT UP TO TWO AND A

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:41.836
HALF SPACES PER HOUSING UNIT

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.704
REGARDLESS. OF THE TYPE OF

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:49.510
DEVELOPMENT IT IS. OF THIS IS A

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:50.745
ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATE

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.013
ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS NOT

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:53.548
SERVED AS TO WHAT IS A DONE

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:54.816
WHAT IS DONE AND IS IT'S

01:30:54.882 --> 01:30:57.051
CREATED OF A SITUATION WHERE

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:58.286
IT'S HARD TO BUILD HOUSING IN A

01:30:58.352 --> 01:30:59.253
LOT OF OUR AREAS BECAUSE THE

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.522
PARKING CAN RANGE FROM THIRTY

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:02.557
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SPACE

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:03.858
UP TO I'VE SEEN EIGHTY THOUSAND

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:04.926
DOLLARS PER FACE RACE FOR SOME

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:06.594
SUBTERRANEAN PARKING WHICH

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:08.329
MEANS THAT PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:09.063
MAYBE ON THE BUBBLE THAT ARE

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:11.098
TRYING TO CREATE HOUSING FOR

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:13.067
THE MISSING MIDDLE DON'T

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:13.701
COUNCIL AND THE DEVELOPERS JUST

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:16.070
WALK AWAY. SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.406
ADD ONE UNIT LET'S SAY- LET'S

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:20.308
LEGAL. IN A MULTI FAMILY AREA

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:21.876
OFTEN CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE OF

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:23.511
SPACE CONSTRAINTS. EVEN IF

01:31:23.578 --> 01:31:25.146
THERE IS ALREADY SOME PARKING

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:26.480
ON THE WATER ENOUGH FOR THOSE

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:28.015
FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THE

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:30.251
POLICY ALSO ENCOURAGES A CAR

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:31.552
CENTRIC APPROACH THAT MAKES

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:32.920
WALKABLE BIKEABLE COMMUNITIES

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:34.755
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. BECAUSE ALL

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:36.390
THAT PARKING SPREADS.

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:38.226
DEVELOPMENTS APART TO WHERE YOU

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.393
CAN'T WALK EASILY FROM ONE TO

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.028
THE NEXT. THINK ABOUT OLD

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:42.530
DOWNTOWNS AND HOW WONDERFUL IT

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:44.165
IS TO STROLL DOWN MAIN STREET.

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:46.267
IMAGINE TODAY ALL OF THOSE SAME

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.235
LITTLE SHOPS ALL HAVING TO

01:31:47.301 --> 01:31:49.036
PROVIDE FIBRE TEN SPACES ON

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:50.037
THEIR OWN SITES YOU CAN'T BUILD

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:52.006
THOSE AREAS. AND YET CITIES ARE

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:53.674
FULLY CAPABLE OF CREATING

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:56.077
BETTER TRANSIT FOR PEOPLE. AND

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:57.778
SHARED PARKING IF THEY NEED TO.

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.981
MANY DOWNTOWNS HAVE MUNICIPAL

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:01.082
STRUCTURES BUT TAKE THE BURDEN

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:03.084
OFF OF. THE INDIVIDUAL

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:04.585
BUSINESSES SO CITIES HAVE A LOT

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:05.853
OF FLEXIBILITY. BUT THERE'S NO

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.822
REASON FOR THEM. TO CREATE GOOD

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:10.658
TRANSIT. IF THEY'RE JUST HAVING

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:12.293
EVERYBODY BRING THE CARS AND-

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.728
WHAT THAT DOES IS IT INCREASES

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:15.396
CONGESTION INCREASES BAD HEALTH

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:17.932
EFFECTS. IS A TERRIBLE USE OF

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:20.601
LAND. AND THIS BILL ONLY

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.203
AFFECTS AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:23.504
CONSIDERED HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:24.672
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:25.740
FEEL THAT YOUR HIGH QUALITY

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.041
TRANCE IT'S ENOUGH.

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:28.576
THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO CREATE

01:32:28.643 --> 01:32:30.011
THE POLITICAL WILL TO CREATE

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:32.213
THAT TRANSIT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.481
IF YOU KEEP INVITING MORE MORE

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.349
CARS IN. IT'S VERY EASY TO SAY

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:36.784
HEY WE'VE GOT ALL THE PARKING

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:37.685
WE'VE GOT ALL THE CARS WE DON'T

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.553
NEED TO DO ANYMORE. IT'S TIME

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.622
TO END THAT MADNESS. TO REFLECT

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.424
OUR VALUES TO PUT THE FOCUS

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:44.558
BACK ON HUMAN BEINGS AND

01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:47.261
INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSING UNITS.

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:51.032
AND THIS IS A SENSIBLE MEASURE.

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:52.233
THAT IS A LONG TIME IN COMING

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.001
IN SEVERAL CITIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.403
HAVE ALREADY MOVED. TO THIS

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:56.671
APPROACH AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.472
ONE OF OUR WITNESSES. AND I

01:32:58.539 --> 01:33:00.174
WITHOUT AYE URGENT AYE VOTE.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:01.342

SUSTAINABLE GROWTH TO MAKE

HOUSING MOREAFFORDABLE. WE

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.878
KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.347
REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:42.683

MULTIPLE CITIES INCLUDING

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:49.890
BERKELEY SHOW THAT MANDATORY

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:51.892
PARKING REQUIREMENTS HAVE LED

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:54.261
TO AN OVERSUPPLY PARKING BY

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:55.997
ELIMINATING PARKING MINIMUMS

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.264
CITIES CAN REDUCE ACCESS

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:58.799
PARKING AND ENCOURAGE THE

01:33:58.866 --> 01:33:59.934
RESIDENTS TO TAKE MORE

01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:01.102
SUSTAINABLE MODES OF

01:34:01.168 --> 01:34:02.770
TRANSPORTATION THAT'S REDUCING

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:05.473
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND IT

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:06.674
BE ICAL MISSIONS. FIGHTING

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:08.109
CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRES BOLD

01:34:08.175 --> 01:34:09.777
ACTION AND CHALLENGING LONG

01:34:09.844 --> 01:34:12.046
HELD ASSUMPTIONS ON HOW WE LIVE

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:13.948

REQUIRING ACCESS PARKING HAS

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:16.717
BEEN SHOWN TO TRY WITH THE

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.419
COSTA HOUSING. MANDATORY

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:19.854
PARKING REQUIREMENTS WORSE IN

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.122
CALIFORNIA SEVERE HOUSING

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:23.157
SHORTAGE BY RAISING THE COST OF

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:25.092
HOUSING PRODUCTION. ON AVERAGE

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:27.762
A GARAGE COSTS TWENTY FOUR TO

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:28.329
THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:34:28.396 --> 01:34:29.530
PER SPACE TO BUILD AND THAT

01:34:29.597 --> 01:34:30.731
COST IS PASSED ON TO

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:32.266
HOUSEHOLDS. REGARDLESS OF

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.335
WHETHER THEY OWN A CAR. LIKE

01:34:34.402 --> 01:34:35.503
WITH SO MANY ISSUES I AM PROUD

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:36.971
THAT BERKELEY IS JOINED OTHER

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:38.472
CALIFORNIA CITIES IN LEADING

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:39.573
THE WAY ON THIS IMPORTANT

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.675
ISSUE. IN JANUARY OUR CITY

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.477
COUNCIL VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:45.146
ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:46.247
NEW DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDE OFF

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:48.516
STREET PARKING SPACES. ARE LAW

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:49.683
ALSO ESTABLISHED A PARKING

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:52.053
MAXIMUM APPOINT FIVE PARKING

SPACES FOR TRANSIT ORIENTED

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:55.489
DEVELOPMENT. AND THIS WAS BASED

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:56.991
ON PARKING SURVEYS THAT SHOW

01:34:57.058 --> 01:34:59.560
THAT MANY PARKING SPOTS IN- OUR

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:00.828
COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS IN IN

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:02.763
TRANSIT RICH AREAS OFTEN ARE IN

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:04.098
HOUSTON THIS IS CERTAIN THE

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:05.633
CASE IN CITIES LIKE BERKELEY.

PEDESTRIAN BICYCLIST COMMUTE

01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:10.471
RATES IN THE COUNTRY. REMOVING

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:11.639
OFF STREET PARKING WILL MAKE

01:35:11.705 --> 01:35:15.643
PROJECTS MORE AFFORDABLE. AND

01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:16.410

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.396
MINIMUM- DISREGARD BECOMES

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.499
VALID. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MY

01:52:52.565 --> 01:52:54.200
DISTRICT WE HAVE TRAIN STATIONS

01:52:54.267 --> 01:52:56.369
ALL ALONG THE COAST. BUT YOU

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:58.204
CANNOT GET FROM A TO B. AT ALL

01:52:58.271 --> 01:52:59.506
BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONNECTION

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:01.174
ANYWHERE ELSE THAT YOU'RE GOING

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:02.175
TO YOU YOU CAN'T EVEN IN MY

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:04.277
CITY IF YOU LIVE DOWNTOWN GET

01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:06.346
TO A GROCERY STORE. YOU KNOW

01:53:06.412 --> 01:53:07.147
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO TO A VERY

01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:09.015
EXPENSIVE ONE SO THAT'S NOT

01:53:09.082 --> 01:53:10.917
PRACTICAL RIGHT NOW AND IF WE

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:12.886
DON'T TIE REDUCTION OF PARKING

01:53:12.952 --> 01:53:14.988
MINIMUMS TO INCREASE IN TRANSIT

01:53:15.054 --> 01:53:16.756
FUNDING FOR THOSE AREAS THAT DO

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:18.491
NOT HAVE FUNCTION TRANSIT. I

01:53:18.558 --> 01:53:19.459
THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE

01:53:19.526 --> 01:53:20.693
ACTUALLY CREATING A PROBLEM

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.629
THAT WE DON'T NEED TO CREATE SO

01:53:22.695 --> 01:53:23.396
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE WILLING

01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:24.464
TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS I DO

01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:26.499
HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:27.667
ABOUT WHAT THIS WOULD DO

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:29.602
SPECIFICALLY IN MY DISTRICT. IN

01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:31.171
SUBURBAN DISTRICTS GENERALLY

01:53:31.237 --> 01:53:32.772

01:53:32.839 --> 01:53:34.507
QUALIFICATIONS IN YOUR BILL FOR

01:53:34.574 --> 01:53:36.409
THE PARKING REDUCTIONS YET DO

01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:37.777
NOT HAVE THE MEANS OF

01:53:37.844 --> 01:53:42.348
EFFECTIVELY INCREASING. OUR

FOR THE CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER

THAT IN. THE COMMITTEE

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:01.788
AMENDMENTS SO THEY'LL HAVE TO

01:56:01.854 --> 01:56:03.022
STILL PROVIDE THE EIGHTY

01:56:03.089 --> 01:56:07.260
PARKING SPACES THAT WE WOULD.

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:07.894
HAVE HAD TO PROVIDE A WOULD ONE

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:08.528
CENT. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO

01:56:08.594 --> 01:56:11.097
DO IS. BATHROOM WELL NOT ONLY

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:12.265
THAT BUT I MEAN I I'M VERY

01:56:12.332 --> 01:56:13.566
SENSITIVE TO THAT FOR NUMBER

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:17.337
REASONS- BY ONE OF THE MOST.

01:56:17.403 --> 01:56:18.404
WAS THAT MY FATHER WAS VERY

01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:20.039
DISABLED FOR LESS LIVING YEARS

01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:21.774
OF HIS LIFE AND REQUIRED. HE

01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:23.543
WAS NON AMBULATORY SUMMIT HAD

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:25.378
NEVER WILL CHAIR EVERY WENT AND

01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:27.547
MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT. AND

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:29.148
WHEN THERE'S NOT. ADEQUATE

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:31.517
PARKING THEIR LIVES ARE

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:32.385
MINIMIZED SUBSTANTIALLY SO.

01:56:32.452 --> 01:56:35.321
THANK YOU YEAH AND I THINK THE

01:56:35.388 --> 01:56:36.689
COMMITTEE FOR POINTING THAT OUT

01:56:36.756 --> 01:56:38.224
TO US AND WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:38.891
MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE ADA

01:56:38.958 --> 01:56:40.760
SPACES THAT ARE REQUIRED-

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:43.896
LEGALLY. WILL BE REQUIRED.

01:56:43.963 --> 01:56:50.136
ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. YES-

01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:51.604
ONCE AGAIN IN MY DISTRICT I

01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:53.106
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:55.375
DIFFERENT PROBLEM I. HAVE A

01:56:55.441 --> 01:56:59.312
VERY RURAL DISTRICT BUT ALSO

01:56:59.379 --> 01:57:02.382
ABOUT 60% OF IT. OUR YOUNG

01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:04.851
GROWING CITIES WITH LIGHT RAIL

01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:08.087
THROUGH THEM. SO THOSE CITIES

01:57:08.154 --> 01:57:10.823
TEND TO LIKE PARKING. AND THEY

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:13.025
REQUIRE EXTRA PARKING. IN THE

01:57:13.092 --> 01:57:15.862
PARKING SPACES- EVEN BIGGER

01:57:15.928 --> 01:57:17.864
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:20.633
THAT DISTRICT. DR LARGE TRUCKS

01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:22.702
THEN IF THEY GOT A GIANT SMELLY

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:24.504
DIESEL TRUCK IT'S EVEN FUNNIER

01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:28.908
FORM SO- WHAT I'M THINKING IS

01:57:28.975 --> 01:57:30.910
WOULD THERE POSSIBLY BE AN

01:57:30.977 --> 01:57:34.847
AMENDMENT- THAT WE COULD DO-

01:57:34.914 --> 01:57:39.585
THAT WOULD EXEMPT. CITIES A

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:41.554
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND BELOW.

01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:43.256
FROM THIS PARTICULAR BILL

01:57:43.322 --> 01:57:45.358
BECAUSE I'M I'M SPOT ON WITH

01:57:45.425 --> 01:57:48.828
YOUR OF FOR. THE GIANT URBAN

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:51.597
AREAS I MEAN SAN FRANCISCO LA

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:54.400
SAN JOSE. GOT IT THIS IS A

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:56.636
GREAT BILL BUT FOR SOME OF THE

01:57:56.702 --> 01:57:58.704
OTHER SMALLER AREAS MAY NOT BE

01:57:58.771 --> 01:58:00.573
SO GOOD SO I'D LIKE TO WORK

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.775
WITH YOU TO. IF POSSIBLE IN THE

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:05.111
FUTURE ON THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

THANK YOU AND WE'RE CERTAINLY

01:58:06.312 --> 01:58:07.980
WILLING TO TALK TO ANY MEMBER

01:58:08.047 --> 01:58:09.081
AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS

01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:10.483
FOR EVERYONE I WILL SAY THAT

01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:12.485
NOTHING IN THE BILL. OF

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:13.786
PROHIBITS DEVELOPERS ARE ADDING

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:15.321
PARKING AND THE EXPERIENCE

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:17.356
MOTHER CITIES HAS BEEN THAT THE

01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:18.925
DEVELOPERS WANT PEOPLE TO USE

01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:20.726
THEIR DEVELOPMENT- AND WHEN

01:58:20.793 --> 01:58:21.761
THEY'RE LEFT TO THEIR OWN YOU

01:58:21.828 --> 01:58:23.296
KNOW THE FREE MARKET I WILL SAY

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:25.298
WORKS IN A LOT OF CASES AND FOR

01:58:25.364 --> 01:58:26.265
INSTANCE PEOPLE BUILDING HIGH

01:58:26.332 --> 01:58:27.500
END LUXURY APARTMENTS ARE

01:58:27.567 --> 01:58:28.601
PROBABLY GOING TO PROVIDE MORE

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:29.836
PARKING THAT I WOULD LIKE THEM

01:58:29.902 --> 01:58:31.471
TO PROVIDE. BUT THEY'RE GOING

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:32.071
TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:33.573
THAT IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THE

01:58:33.639 --> 01:58:35.174
UNITS WILL READ FOR A LESSER

01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:36.576
AMOUNT OF MONEY THIS IS REALLY

01:58:36.642 --> 01:58:37.543
GOING TO HELP THOSE MIDDLE

01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:39.278
CLASS DEVELOPMENTS WHERE

01:58:39.345 --> 01:58:40.546
THEY'RE TRYING TO AIM AT THE

THE HOME DEPOT DOWN THE BLOCKS

01:58:51.824 --> 01:58:53.526
GOT THE SPACES I'M GOING TO ADD

01:58:53.593 --> 01:58:55.161
THE SPACES HERE OR THE CITIES

01:58:55.228 --> 01:58:56.496
CAN HELP THEM BY BUILDING A

01:58:56.562 --> 01:58:57.497
MUNICIPAL PARKING LOT THE

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:17.817
MANAGEMENT SHARED PARKING.

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:19.018
THAT'S WHAT BUFFALO FOUND

01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:20.286
BUFFALO IS NOT A HUGE CITY I

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:21.053
USED TO LIVE NEAR THERE IN

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:23.022
ROCHESTER AND WHEN THEY TOOK

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:23.756
AWAY THE PARKING FROM THEIR

01:59:23.823 --> 01:59:25.491
CITY VERY CLEARLY THEY FOUND

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:26.392
THAT THE DEVELOPERS ARE

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:27.793
ACTUALLY SHARING AND SAYING HEY

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:29.495
LET'S LET'S SHARE THIS PARKING

01:59:29.562 --> 01:59:30.863
TOGETHER SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:31.864
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:59:31.931 --> 01:59:33.833
AND I. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:34.667
CASE WHERE THE MARKET'S GOING

01:59:34.734 --> 01:59:39.639
TO HELP WITH THAT- AND. PEOPLE

01:59:39.705 --> 01:59:40.106
WANT THE PROJECT TO BE

01:59:40.172 --> 01:59:40.706
SUCCESSFUL. BUT WILL WE WILL

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:42.074
WORK WITH YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:45.278
BLUE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:46.512
WAS LAUGHING A LITTLE BIT

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:47.513
DURING THE LAST DISCUSSION

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.382
BECAUSE I HAVE A THREE CITIES

01:59:49.448 --> 01:59:51.117
UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND-

01:59:51.183 --> 01:59:53.452
AND IN MY DISTRICT- AND THEY'RE

01:59:53.519 --> 01:59:57.356
ALL VERY DENSE AND TO MOST OF

01:59:57.423 --> 02:00:00.159
THEM ARE A 100% WOULD PROBABLY

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:03.062
QUALIFY- AS BEING WITHIN A HALF

02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:05.932
MILE OF TRANSIT SO WE'RE GOING

02:00:05.998 --> 02:00:07.333
TO HAVE LANGUAGE WE WANT TO

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.635
CRAFTED VERY CAREFULLY BUT- I'M

02:00:09.702 --> 02:00:10.803
GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:12.605
TODAY I THINK THIS IS VERY

02:00:12.672 --> 02:00:14.407
IMPORTANT POLICY IT'S A VERY

02:00:14.473 --> 02:00:16.642
IMPORTANT POLICY DISCUSSION WE

02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:18.711
HAVE BEEN. OVER PARKING AND

02:00:18.778 --> 02:00:20.246
BUILDING TOO MUCH PARKING IN

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:22.648
OUR COMMUNITIES FOR MANY MANY

02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:26.252
YEARS AND IT HAS- YOU KNOW IT'S

02:00:26.319 --> 02:00:28.020
IN LARGE PART A RESPONSE TO

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:29.922
PEOPLE BEING AFRAID OF

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:32.491
DEVELOPMENT- FEAR OF

02:00:32.558 --> 02:00:36.195
DEVELOPMENT HAS LED TO- ACIVIR

02:00:36.262 --> 02:00:37.530
CONSTRAINT ON THE AMOUNT OF

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:39.298
HOUSING THAT WE HAVE BOTH

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:41.300
MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:43.769
HOUSING AND- PARTICULARLY-

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:46.172
HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS AND IT

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:48.374
IS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:50.710
HOUSING COSTS ARE HIGH BUT IT

02:00:50.776 --> 02:00:52.478
IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:54.013
DRIVERS SO THE TO THE EXTENT

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.515
THAT WE CAN. HAVE A DEBATE

02:00:56.582 --> 02:01:03.055
ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE- THESE UP

02:01:03.122 --> 02:01:06.425
UP UP PARKING GOT REQUIREMENTS-

02:01:06.492 --> 02:01:07.893
IT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:12.198
DISCUSSION FORCE. I WILL- POINT

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:14.233
OUT THAT- WE LEARNED IN

02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:15.568
DOWNTOWN THAT WOULD NOT

02:01:15.635 --> 02:01:16.869
DOWNTOWN IN THE- BERGAMOT

02:01:16.936 --> 02:01:18.904
STATIONARY OF FIVE OF SANTA

02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:20.673
MONICA FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:23.042
FAMILIAR WITH IT- THAT THERE

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:25.211
WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

02:01:25.277 --> 02:01:27.680
UNUSED PARKING SPACES-

02:01:27.747 --> 02:01:28.881
PRIMARILY IN COMMERCIAL

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:31.417
BUILDINGS IN THAT AREA- BUT

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:32.885
WHEN A STUDY WAS DONE THEY WERE

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:33.853
JUST YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE

02:01:33.919 --> 02:01:35.187
BEEN THIS BILL THEY HAVE BEEN

02:01:35.254 --> 02:01:38.724
SO OVER PARKED THAT THERE WERE

02:01:38.791 --> 02:01:39.358
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF SPACES

02:01:39.425 --> 02:01:41.727
THAT WERE GOING ON USED. EVERY

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:44.964
DAY WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY-

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:47.066
AND WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING-

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:48.267
WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO LOWER THE

02:01:48.334 --> 02:01:50.503
COST IS IMPORTANT THE OTHER ONE

02:01:50.569 --> 02:01:54.040
CONCERN I HAVE AND- I JUST WANT

02:01:54.106 --> 02:01:55.908
TO HIGHLIGHT IT- IT'S NOT GONNA

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:58.711
AFFECT MY BOOK TODAY- BUT I DO

02:01:58.778 --> 02:02:01.047
BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME- AND I

02:02:01.113 --> 02:02:03.749
HAVE TO SAY HAVING GOT- AMIR

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:07.887
KHAN THIS AS YOUR WITNESS- GOOD

02:02:07.953 --> 02:02:11.457
GIVES GREAT CREDIBILITY- TO-

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:12.625
YOUR ARGUMENT IS THE AUTHOR ON

02:02:12.692 --> 02:02:15.594
THIS. OTHER IT WON'T AFFECT A-

02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:16.796
THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE

02:02:16.862 --> 02:02:18.097
HOUSING BUT SOME OF THE

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:19.932
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS

02:02:19.999 --> 02:02:22.301
ARE EXPRESSING SOME CONCERNS-

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:28.741
PRIMARILY BECAUSE- IT IT IT'S-

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:31.544
UNFORTUNATE- AFFIRMATIVE. OF

02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:34.080
FROM THE- OF THIS ISSUE OF OVER

02:02:34.146 --> 02:02:37.149
PARKING BUT- PARKING IS ONE OF

02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:38.751
THE THINGS THAT ARE NEGOTIATED.

02:02:38.818 --> 02:02:40.019
WHEN IT COMES TO DENSITY

02:02:40.086 --> 02:02:43.189
BONUSES AND- PENCILING OUT

02:02:43.255 --> 02:02:45.291
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS- SO

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:47.860
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- OF

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.862
THESE POLICIES ARE NOT IN

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:51.797
CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER-

02:02:51.864 --> 02:02:53.566
BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH. OBVIOUSLY

02:02:53.632 --> 02:02:55.334
A HOUSING PRODUCTION IS

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.737
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AND THE

02:02:57.803 --> 02:03:00.072
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS THAT YOU

02:03:00.139 --> 02:03:01.140

PRESENTATION ARE IMPORTANT AS

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:06.946
WELL- SO- WITH- WITH THAT ONE

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:09.949
ISSUE- HANGING OUT THERE- WHICH

02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:10.916
I HOPE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

WE'RE DISCUSSING THIS AT RIGHT

02:03:33.672 --> 02:03:34.707
NOW IN LOS ANGELES THEY'RE

02:03:34.774 --> 02:03:36.542
LITERALLY USING UNUSED PARKING

02:03:36.609 --> 02:03:38.310
CAPACITY TO. PUT TENTS UP TO

02:03:38.377 --> 02:03:40.412

THESE ARE THIS IS LAND THAT

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:42.615
REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOUSING

02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:43.949
GOING WAY BACK AND THE FACT

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:44.683
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO MOVE

02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:45.918
CARS TO DO THAT. THEY HAVE

02:03:45.985 --> 02:03:47.186
ENOUGH JUST UNDER UTILIZED AN

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:49.355
UNUSED LAND THAT'S JUST

02:03:49.421 --> 02:03:51.557

TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO REDUCE

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:14.146
THE COST OF HOUSING WITHOUT NEW

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:15.948
FUNDING. THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT

02:04:16.015 --> 02:04:17.349
OF EVIDENCE THAT MANY OF THE

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:18.884
PARKING STANDARDS THAT EXIST AT

02:04:18.951 --> 02:04:20.519

MEASURABLY INCREASES DEMAND FOR

02:04:30.362 --> 02:04:32.064
VEHICLE PARTNERSHIP. WHICH CAN

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:33.632
FRUSTRATE OUR ABILITY TO

EIGHTY SIX OH TWO ALIGNS WITH

SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS-

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:22.948
THIS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:25.184
THAT WE PUBLISHED THREE UNIQUE

DEVELOPED PARTNER THE FIRST

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:32.324
THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT. WE

02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:34.059
DON'T FEES ARE VERY IMPORTANT

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:35.928
SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR CITIES

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:37.529
LOOKING TO MITIGATE THE REAL

02:10:37.596 --> 02:10:39.298
IMPACT OF NEW HOUSING THE BUT

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:41.033
BECAUSE CITIES ARE GENERALLY

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:42.568
CONSTRAINED ON HOW WE CAN RAISE

02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:44.836
REVENUE FOR THINGS LIKE PARKS

02:10:44.903 --> 02:10:46.638
AND ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE. WBZ

02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:49.141
ARE OFTEN TIMES THE ONLY WAY

02:10:49.208 --> 02:10:50.742
SOME OF THESE CRITICAL PROJECTS

02:10:50.809 --> 02:10:53.345
CAN GET FUNDED IT ISALSO TRUE

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:54.513
THAT FEES ARE NOT ALWAYS

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.481

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.392
CLEARLY. ULTIMATELY UP. THE FOR

02:11:07.459 --> 02:11:08.527
THAT NEW HOME- WHICH IS

02:11:08.594 --> 02:11:09.328
OBVIOUSLY ISSUE HERE IN

02:11:09.394 --> 02:11:10.996
CALIFORNIA WHERE HOME PRICES

02:11:11.063 --> 02:11:12.064
ARE. REALLY CONTINUE TO

02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:13.999
SKYROCKET. AND OUR RESEARCH

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:15.667
SUGGESTS THAT SIMPLE CHANGES IN

02:11:15.734 --> 02:11:16.535
THE CALCULATION IN THE

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:18.537
POSITION. OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT

02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:20.539

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:22.674
HE SEES. WITH THE ACTUAL

02:11:22.741 --> 02:11:24.476
IMPACTS. WHILE ALSO LOWERING

02:11:24.543 --> 02:11:26.411
DEVELOPMENT COSTS OVERALL- FOR

02:11:26.478 --> 02:11:28.380
EXAMPLE. THAT SHIFTING TO A PER

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:29.781
SQUARE FOOT CALCULATION FOR

02:11:29.848 --> 02:11:32.317
CERTAIN FEES RATHER THAN- J. A

02:11:32.384 --> 02:11:34.052
PER UNIT BASIS WHICH IS WHAT

02:11:34.119 --> 02:11:36.054
MANY TO DETECT- THAT CAN. IN

02:11:36.121 --> 02:11:37.155
SOME CASES MORE ACCURATELY

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:38.590
REFLECT THE NEW ATTACKS THE

02:11:38.657 --> 02:11:40.626
RESULT IN MORE RECENT COST- IT

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:42.561
IS CHANGE ALSO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:11:42.628 --> 02:11:43.695
ALLUDED TO IT DOESN'T AND

02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:45.664
INTENTIONALLY PUNISH SMALL UNIT

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:48.600
DEVELOPMENT. AS WE SEE TODAY IN

02:11:48.667 --> 02:11:49.735
THE CITY THAT YOU THEY KERR

02:11:49.801 --> 02:11:52.938
UNIT CALCULATION- AND SO EIGHTY

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:53.739
SIX OH TWO MAKES IT PRETTY

02:11:53.805 --> 02:11:56.208
SIMPLE CHANGE. ALSO ALLOWS FOR

02:11:56.275 --> 02:11:57.643
FLEXIBILITY IN INSTANCES WHERE

02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:59.711
AS YOU CHANGE MAY. NOT BE

02:11:59.778 --> 02:12:01.113
POSSIBLE OR OR ACTIVITY JUST

02:12:01.179 --> 02:12:03.215
SO. AGAIN A CALCULATION IN A

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:05.217
POSITION OF IMPACT THESE IS A

02:12:05.284 --> 02:12:06.952
REALLY TECHNICAL COMPLEX

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:08.820

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:12.190
REALLY IMPORTANT. TO ENSURE

02:12:12.257 --> 02:12:13.358

AROUND YOUR BILL IN THE STATE

02:46:51.234 --> 02:46:52.969
WIDE. IMPACT WE HAD

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:55.071
CONVERSATIONS OF DIRECT-

02:46:55.138 --> 02:46:57.207

THAT IS SOMETHING IS THERE BUT

02:47:01.277 --> 02:47:03.380
I'M NOT SURE WE COULD- TOTALLY

02:47:03.446 --> 02:47:05.215
DIGRESS FROM TALKING ABOUT

02:47:05.281 --> 02:47:05.982
SPECIFICALLY SAMBAR DINO

02:47:06.049 --> 02:47:08.151
COUNTY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:47:08.218 --> 02:47:10.286
SALARY INPUT TO IT. BECAUSE

02:47:10.353 --> 02:47:11.654
WHEN WE LOOK AT THROUGHOUT THE

02:47:11.721 --> 02:47:12.622
DIFFERENT COUNTIES FIFTY EIGHT

02:47:12.689 --> 02:47:14.557

THAT. THE DISK OF SALARIES HAS

02:47:23.733 --> 02:47:24.567
ONE THAT HAS BEEN A HEATED

02:47:24.634 --> 02:47:27.370
DEBATE NOT JUST IN TWENTY

02:47:27.437 --> 02:47:28.805
TWENTY BUT IT GOES FARTHER BACK

02:47:28.872 --> 02:47:30.840
INTO WHERE I CAN REMEMBER TWO

02:47:30.907 --> 02:47:33.643
THOUSAND FIVE. AND THEN TWO

02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:34.511
THOUSAND TWELVE THERE WAS

02:47:34.577 --> 02:47:35.111
COMPETING MEASURES THAT TOOK

02:47:35.178 --> 02:47:37.313
PLACE THAT ULTIMATELY THE BOARD

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:38.615
OF SUPERVISORS INITIATIVE ONE

02:47:38.681 --> 02:47:42.218
THAT. ONE THAT WITH A CLOSER-

02:47:42.285 --> 02:47:43.253
CLOSER PERCENTAGE THAN THIS

02:47:43.319 --> 02:47:45.688
LAST ONE. IN A TWENTY TWENTY

02:47:45.755 --> 02:47:47.257
CAME THE COMPETING MEASURES

02:47:47.323 --> 02:47:49.492
THAT SET THIS FORWARD. SO IT

02:47:49.559 --> 02:47:52.028
SHOWS A PATTERN OF THE PEOPLE

02:47:52.095 --> 02:47:53.396
YOU STARTED OFF WITH YOUR WITH

02:47:53.463 --> 02:47:56.633
YOUR- TOPIC IN YOUR TESTIMONY.

02:47:56.699 --> 02:47:57.934
THAT IS A DEMOCRATIC.

02:47:58.001 --> 02:47:59.436
INSTITUTIONAL RIGHT BUT I.

02:47:59.502 --> 02:48:01.671
COUNTER AND SAY THAT IT'S ALSO

02:48:01.738 --> 02:48:03.473
A DEMOCRATIC RIGHT FOR THE

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:05.341
VOTERS OF THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE.

02:48:05.408 --> 02:48:06.443
THINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

02:48:06.509 --> 02:48:08.812
CALIFORNIA AND WE SEE HERE THAT

02:48:08.878 --> 02:48:10.947
A PATTERN HAS BEEN SET. A

02:48:11.014 --> 02:48:12.916
PATTERN HAS BEEN SET YEAH AND

02:48:12.982 --> 02:48:14.884
THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE

02:48:14.951 --> 02:48:18.121
OF SETTING SALARIES SO WHY. AND

02:48:18.188 --> 02:48:19.155
I'M STILL WAITING FOR

02:48:19.222 --> 02:48:20.290
CLARIFICATION ON B. AND I'M

02:48:20.356 --> 02:48:21.791
HOPING THAT THAT WOULD GO BACK

02:48:21.858 --> 02:48:22.826
TO THE ELECTORATE BECAUSE THAT

02:48:22.892 --> 02:48:26.396
HELPS SOME. BUT ON SECTION

02:48:26.463 --> 02:48:26.930
TWENTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED

02:48:26.996 --> 02:48:28.131
THERE'S NO MENTION OF IT WHEN

02:48:28.198 --> 02:48:30.400
WE KNOW THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE

02:48:30.467 --> 02:48:33.102
THAT THE LOCAL LOCAL CONTROL AT

02:48:33.169 --> 02:48:35.138
ITS FINEST. IS THE DEFINITION

02:48:35.205 --> 02:48:37.574
OF SENDING THAT SALARY WHICH

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.509
THE TAXPAYERS OF ALL FIFTY

02:48:39.576 --> 02:48:41.110
EIGHT COUNTIES PAY INTO THAT

02:48:41.177 --> 02:48:42.345
GENERAL FUND TO PAY THE

02:48:42.412 --> 02:48:44.581
SALARIES OF THOSE SUPERVISORS

02:48:44.647 --> 02:48:45.114
AND I'M SAYING THAT THERE

02:48:45.181 --> 02:48:47.217
SHOULD BE A VOICE. A COMPONENT

02:48:47.283 --> 02:48:49.085
FOR THEM TO BE HEARD SUCH AS

02:48:49.152 --> 02:48:50.653
THE PATTERN THAT WAS SET IN

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:56.426
SAMBAR. THIS LOCAL CONTROL

02:48:56.493 --> 02:48:59.062
ISSUE FOR ME TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:48:59.128 --> 02:49:01.464
VOICE IS BEING HEARD- AGREE

02:49:01.531 --> 02:49:02.565
WITH YOU MISTER ALMOST IN FACT

02:49:02.632 --> 02:49:04.434
AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON

02:49:04.501 --> 02:49:06.302
THIS- AS YOU KNOW THERE HAD

02:49:06.369 --> 02:49:08.071
BEEN SOME ISSUES IN THE PAST-

02:49:08.137 --> 02:49:10.039
IN REGARDS TO YOU- SOME OF THE

02:49:10.106 --> 02:49:11.241
LOCAL COUNTY BOARD OF

02:49:11.307 --> 02:49:14.077
SUPERVISORS TO- DECIDED- THAT

02:49:14.143 --> 02:49:16.446
THEY WOULD- REYES THE EXECUTIVE

02:49:16.513 --> 02:49:18.915
COMPENSATION- IN TERMS OF

02:49:18.982 --> 02:49:19.949
HEALTH BENEFITS AND OTHER

02:49:20.016 --> 02:49:21.918
THINGS TO TRY TO PAD- THERE.

02:49:21.985 --> 02:49:24.354
OTHER SALARIES- I DO THINK THAT

02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:26.089
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LIMITS

02:49:26.155 --> 02:49:27.790
TO WHAT- COUNTY BOARD OF

02:49:27.857 --> 02:49:29.225
SUPERVISORS CAN DECIDE THAT

02:49:29.292 --> 02:49:31.194
THEIR OWN PAY- SHOULD BE AND SO

02:49:31.261 --> 02:49:32.662
YOU AND I ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH

02:49:32.729 --> 02:49:34.364
THAT- ON THAT THAT THAT MAY BE

02:49:34.430 --> 02:49:35.832
AS WE AS THIS BILL MOVES

02:49:35.899 --> 02:49:37.567
FORWARD WE CAN- WE CAN WORK ON

02:49:37.634 --> 02:49:39.369
THAT- YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE

02:49:39.435 --> 02:49:40.637
THAT THERE ARE SOME SOME LIMITS

02:49:40.703 --> 02:49:45.308
SO THERE ARE BAD ACTORS- THE

02:49:45.375 --> 02:49:45.808
DATE THAT WE'VE GOT SOME

02:49:45.875 --> 02:49:46.709
CONTROLS THAT ARE THERE. YEAH

02:49:46.776 --> 02:49:48.845
THANK YOU FOR THAT. ALSO MEMBER-

02:49:48.912 --> 02:49:53.750
BUT WE KNOW THAT- THAT THIS

02:49:53.816 --> 02:49:55.018
CHECK A BALANCE OF THE LOCAL

02:49:55.084 --> 02:49:58.655
GUY IS THE VOTE THE P. MUCH SO

02:49:58.721 --> 02:50:00.189
THAT TERM LIMITS HE HERE IN THE

02:50:00.256 --> 02:50:04.127
STATE LET. WAS OUT WITHIN A-

02:50:04.193 --> 02:50:05.828

02:50:10.066 --> 02:50:12.569
TWO NINE. AND THEN LATER ON-

02:50:12.635 --> 02:50:14.337
STARTED AND WENT BACK AGAIN TO

02:50:14.404 --> 02:50:16.573
THE ACA PROCESS HERE TO GO BACK

02:50:16.639 --> 02:50:17.373

CURRENTLY ARE UNDER NOW WITH

THE TWELVE YEAR CYCLE. SO THE

02:50:24.347 --> 02:50:26.849
POINT IS IT'S NOT ABOUT. IN MY

02:50:26.916 --> 02:50:27.984

BETTER- TRUST THE GOVERNMENT

02:50:35.692 --> 02:50:37.994
THAT SERVES THEM WHEN WE START

02:50:38.061 --> 02:50:39.896
TO SET OUR OWN SALARIES WHEN WE

02:50:39.963 --> 02:50:42.265

CERTAIN ELECTIONS DIDN'T GO ONE

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:45.401

02:50:45.468 --> 02:50:47.303

REIMBURSE US ON CERTAIN THINGS.

02:51:07.490 --> 02:51:09.726
THIS IS A PROCESS THAT NEEDS TO

MY SEVENTH YEAR IN THE

02:56:31.113 --> 02:56:32.782
LEGISLATURE I KNOW THAT WHEN

02:56:32.848 --> 02:56:34.417
THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT COMES

02:56:34.483 --> 02:56:39.021

TO. OF MINORS IS THAT THE BILL

02:56:48.664 --> 02:56:49.999
DOES NOT TURN OVER THE RESULTS

02:56:50.066 --> 02:56:51.934
OF AN ELECTION THAT HAS COME

02:56:52.001 --> 02:56:54.170
BEFORE- THAT IS ONLY

02:56:54.236 --> 02:56:56.939
PERSPECTIVE GOING FORWARD.

02:56:57.006 --> 02:57:00.076
THERE WAS HOWEVER AN ELECTION.

02:57:00.142 --> 02:57:03.312
A REFERENDUM THAT- I CREATED A

02:57:03.379 --> 02:57:06.248
SCENARIO WHERE I IN- ONE

02:57:06.315 --> 02:57:08.017
COUNTY. THERE WOULD BE A

02:57:08.084 --> 02:57:10.853
RESTRICTION TO ONE TERM YOU

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:12.788
COULD ONLY BE IN OFFICE FOR

02:57:12.855 --> 02:57:13.889
FOUR YEARS IS THAT CORRECT

02:57:13.956 --> 02:57:19.562
THAT'S CORRECT. AND IT IS. UGH

02:57:19.628 --> 02:57:20.863

I SHARE THAT FOR YEARS IS TOO

02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:27.236
SHORT A PERIOD OF TIME- AND IT

02:57:27.303 --> 02:57:28.637
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SOMEBODY

02:57:28.704 --> 02:57:29.705
CAN'T BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE

02:57:29.772 --> 02:57:32.341
BUT AFTER DOING A BAD JOB BYE

02:57:32.408 --> 02:57:34.510
BYE BY THE PEOPLE THAT COULD

02:57:34.577 --> 02:57:36.746
CERTAINLY HAPPEN BUT GENERALLY

02:57:36.812 --> 02:57:40.149
SPEAKING FOR YEARS IT HAS- A

02:57:40.216 --> 02:57:43.719
SUB OPTIMAL TIME- TO BE AN

02:57:43.786 --> 02:57:45.688

THIS COMMITTEE- TWO YEARS AGO-

03:04:15.878 --> 03:04:18.046
BECAUSE- I HAD BEEN DEEPLY

03:04:18.113 --> 03:04:21.984
CONCERNED THAT ALMOST 60% OF

03:04:22.050 --> 03:04:23.752
THE PEOPLE OF THE RATE PAYERS.

03:04:23.819 --> 03:04:25.254
WITHIN IDEOLOGICAL SERVICE

AND DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

BE ABLE TO- TO VOTE AND SO WE

03:04:33.962 --> 03:04:35.798
HAD A BILL- TWO YEARS AGO OF

03:04:35.864 --> 03:04:38.100

03:04:43.739 --> 03:04:45.073
HAVE BEEN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY

03:04:45.140 --> 03:04:46.842
TO PROVIDE THAT BALANCE BETWEEN

03:04:46.909 --> 03:04:49.945
THE TWO- THE AS YOU REMEMBER A

03:04:50.012 --> 03:04:51.880
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- IT WAS A

03:04:51.947 --> 03:04:53.582
PRETTY CONTENTIOUS- AND THE

03:04:53.649 --> 03:04:55.918
REASON. FOR THAT- WAS- THE

03:04:55.984 --> 03:04:57.152
FOLKS AT THE IMPALER GEISHA

03:04:57.219 --> 03:04:58.787

03:04:58.854 --> 03:05:02.024
CONCERNS ABOUT- ABOUT THE BILL-

03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:03.725
IN SPECIFIC THEY WERE VERY

03:05:03.792 --> 03:05:05.060
CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR WATER

03:05:05.127 --> 03:05:06.829

MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ON THEIR

BOARD COMING FROM RIVERSIDE

03:05:11.433 --> 03:05:13.302

THEIR FUTURE WATER RIGHTS AND

03:05:14.670 --> 03:05:15.737
WE HEARD THEM TRIED TO WORK ON

03:05:15.804 --> 03:05:17.606
THAT WORK THROUGH THROUGH THAT-

03:05:17.673 --> 03:05:19.074
THIS BILL BEFORE YOU- IS

03:05:19.141 --> 03:05:22.010

INSTEAD OF. HAVING SIX MEMBERS

03:05:32.754 --> 03:05:33.889
I THAT WOULD BE ELECTED TO THE

03:05:33.956 --> 03:05:35.691
BOARD- IT WOULD PROVIDE FOR ONE

03:05:35.757 --> 03:05:37.392
