00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.607
LAND DEVELOPER THAT MIGHT FOCUS

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:03.342
ON ACQUISITION JUST THROUGH THE

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.611
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS AND SO.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.313
THEY ARE DEALING WITH --

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.449
LOOKING AT LAND THEY'RE DEALING

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.018
WITH THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.586
SEEN THROUGH A CITY OR A COUNTY.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.820
THEY'RE DEALING WITH REGULATORY

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.789
AGENCIES AND THEY'RE WORKING

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:18.858
ULTIMATELY TO A POINT OF GETTING

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:20.259
TO WHAT WE REFER TO AS A

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:21.294
TENTATIVE MAP.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.262
AND AT THAT POINT --

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.764
THE PROJECT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.267
BE SOLD TO ANOTHER --

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.402
DEVELOPER --

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:30.603
THAT WOULD THEN TAKE IT FROM

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.271
THAT POINT FOR WHICH WOULD BE

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:33.539
SOMEONE THAT WAS BEING AT DOING

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:35.074
THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.442
LAND WERE YOU DOING THE A

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:37.576
GRADING.

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:38.811
YOUR ALSO TAKEN FROM ATTENDED A

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.379
MAP TO A FINAL MAP YOU'RE DOING

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:42.148
MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT EXACTLY HOW

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.616
THE HOMES ARE GONNA LAY OUT.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.685
YOU'RE DEALING WITH ST LAYOUTS

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.386
YOU'RE DEALING WITH SEWER WATER

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:48.921
AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING THOSE

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:50.589
PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS ALL TO

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:53.092
REALLY GET THE DEVELOPMENT TO A

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.327
POINT OF HAVING FINISHED LOTS.

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:55.428
AT THE POINT OF HAVING FINISHED

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:57.530
LOTS YOU COULD BE A DEVELOPER

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:59.665
THAT WOULD THEN SELL FINISH LOTS

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:00.499
TO WHAT I CALLED MERCHANT

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:01.400
BUILDERS.

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:02.501
AND SOMEONE OUR INDUSTRY THAT'S

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:03.936
REALLY WHAT THEY'RE FOCUSES THEY

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.738
ARE TRULY JUST A HOME BUILDER.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.139
THEY'RE NOT A LAND DEVELOPER

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:08.474
THEY COME IN AT THE POINT OF A

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:09.642
FINISH LOT IN THERE DOING WHAT

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.177
WE CALL VERTICAL CONSTRUCTION

00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:12.345
AND SO.

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:13.779
EACH ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:15.848
WITHIN THE PROCESS HAS DIFFERENT

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.984
RISK IN BASED ON THOSE RISKS THE

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.652
HURDLES ARE THE METRICS OF HOW.

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.454
WE ANALYZE A PROJECT AND WHETHER

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.322
THAT PROJECT HAS KIND OF A GO NO

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:25.124
GO AND THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:25.324
THAT.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.094
HAVE TO BE DETERMINE OTHERS

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.362
SIMILAR TO SHADE HOMES THE

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:30.830
COMPANY I WORK.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.264
FOR WE AT TIMES WILL DO ALL

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.666
THREE WE WILL TAKE IT FROM THE

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:34.934
POINT OF TYING UP A PROPERTY

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.502
THAT COULD BE WITH THE LANDOWNER

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.570
COULD BE IS A GREENFIELD

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:39.038
FARMLAND.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.906
IT COULD BE A RE USE OF A OF AN

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.975
OLD INDUSTRIAL BUILDING THAT WE

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:44.543
THINK HAS THE ABILITY DUE TO AN

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.312
AREA WHAT MONTH MIGHT NEED SOME

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:49.148
HOUSING. TO MOVE FORWARD IN WITH

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:49.749
THAT YOU HAVE THE COMPLEXITIES

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.984
OF THE SAME THE SAME ISSUES BUT

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:52.952
YOU MIGHT HAVE DECONSTRUCTION

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:54.353
YOU MIGHT HAVE ARE MIDDLE

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.154
CONCERNS YOU HAVE TO WORK

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:55.755
THROUGH.

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.956
THAT WE WOULD TAKE A PROPERTY

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:58.324
ALL THE WAY THROUGH A POINT OF

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:00.059
BUILDING HOUSES OTHERS WOULD

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.927
PICK ONE OF THE THREE AND THAT

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:02.395
COULD BE THEIR OVERALL

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:03.662
DISCIPLINE.

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:04.530
IT'S JUST JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:05.765
THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.700
DISTINCTION AND HOW WE EVALUATE

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:08.868
PROPERTIES AND YOU'LL SEE A

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:10.369
LITTLE BIT OF THAT ON THE

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:10.936
EXAMPLES THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:13.239
GIVE YOU.

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:15.641
FACTORS INFLUENCING HOMEBUILDING

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:16.976
YOU KNOW THE HAZARD IS A

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.511
SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE THINGS

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:20.079
THAT WE ANALYZE.

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.747
AND AS I MENTIONED EACH ONE OF

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:23.416
THE COMPONENTS WITH IN THE

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.818
PROCESS SOME OF THESE ARE MORE

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:27.420
SIGNIFICANT THAN OTHERS.

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:28.954
RELATIVE TO SOME OF ITS ABOUT IN

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.656
TITLE IN A PROJECT TO THE POINT

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:31.657
OF GETTING APPROVED TENTATIVE

00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:33.192
MAP WHERE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:34.693
REGULATORY APPROVALS.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.328
YOU'RE REALLY FOCUS ON SOME OF

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:39.165
THOSE EARLY ONES THE ACQUISITION --

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.666
PROCESS HOW YOU'RE TYING UP THE

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.535
PROPERTY A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:46.539
GO OUT AND BUY A PROPERTY --

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:47.573
IMMEDIATELY DAY ONE LET'S HAS WE

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.141
DO IS WE TIE UP PROPERTIES UNDER

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.209
A CONTRACT.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:52.144
AND AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH AND

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.780
WE MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT ARE

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:55.381
INHERENT IN THAT DEVELOPMENT

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:56.148
THROUGH.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:59.185
WORKING THROUGH CONSULTANTS AND

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.386
PROPERTY AND AS WE WORK WITH THE

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.388
CITY'S THE REGULATORS AS WE ARE

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:04.023
GET TO A POINT CLOSER TO ATTEND

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:04.824
OF MAP.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.892
WE THEN WILL INVEST MORE DOLLARS

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.360
AND ULTIMATELY ACQUIRE THE

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:09.562
PROPERTY.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.397
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE TIME IT

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.466
TAKES TO DO THAT IS A A FUNCTION

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:16.001
OF CERTAIN RETURNS THAT WE'RE

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.236
EXPECTING OUR INVESTMENT.

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:19.405
AND SO TIME IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.739
OBVIOUSLY IN THE FINANCING

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.241
STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE FOR A

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:23.476
PARTICULAR DEAL.

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:25.277
REASON WE HAVE SEQUEL UP THERE.

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:27.413
IS THAT SEQUEL CAN BE ONE OF

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.081
THOSE IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR TIMING

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:30.282
THE COST OF NOT ONLY.

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:32.384
PROVIDING A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE

00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:34.420
CHALLENGE OR LEAST JUST GOING

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:35.888
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OF THE

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.556
SEQUEL A REVIEW BUT THEN THE

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:39.058
POTENTIAL CHALLENGE IN THAT EVEN

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.093
IF WE WHEN THE CHALLENGE THERE

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.361
COULD BE APPEALED PERIODS.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:43.562
IF YOU LOOK AT SEEK WITH THE

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.030
MOUNTIE YEARS AND SOME OF US

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.365
HAVE EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS THAT

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:49.602
HAVE TAKEN US MULTI MULTI YEARS.

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:50.903
TO GET THROUGH APPROVAL PROCESS.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.139
BECAUSE A SEQUEL IS BEING USED

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:53.706
AS A WAY OF CHALLENGING OUR

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.241
PROJECT.

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:56.675
ENTITLEMENTS WE TALKED A BIT

00:12:56.742 --> 00:12:57.743
ABOUT THAT WORKING THROUGH THE

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.512
ENTIRE PROCESS ALONG WITH THE

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:00.679
REGULATORY --

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:03.149
ISSUES WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.416
DEVELOP AN IMPACT FEE SCHOOL

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:05.784
FEES.

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:08.287
IN EVERY CITY WE HAVE THESE CITY

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:09.522
ARE COUNTIES WE HAVE FEES THAT

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:11.223
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEY'RE

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.658
NOT THE SAME --

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.293
IN NEED CITY --

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.928
I'M I DO A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IN

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:16.962
LIVERMORE.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:18.197
THE CITY FEES THERE ARE

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.498
APPROACHING OVER A HUNDRED

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:21.734
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.235
OTHER CITIES YOU MY WORK AND IT

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:26.772
COULD BE AS LOW AS TWENTY FIVE

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:27.439
TO THIRTY THOUSAND SO WE HAVE TO

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:29.175
UNDERSTAND THE FEE IMPACTS AND

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:30.342
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:31.443
BY THAT CITY.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.212
INCLUDED INCLUSIONARY ZONING

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.014
COULD BE IFFY BUT MANY TIMES

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.015
INCLUSIONARY ONING IS A

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.384
REQUIREMENT SO PORTION OF OUR

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.486
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO BE

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:42.121
WHAT THEY CALL BELOW MARKET RATE

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:43.622
OUR BMR REQUIREMENT.

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:44.623
AND THERE'S DIFFERENT --

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.560
FACTORS OF WHETHER IT'S VERY LOW.

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:49.461
AND EACH ONE OF THOSE HAVE.

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:50.796
TIMES THINGS WE HAVE TO ANALYZE

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.831
AND BE CONCERNED BUT AS A VERY

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.133
VERY INCLUSIONARY ZONING IS A

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.268
VERY COSTLY COMPONENT THAT IS

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.570
BASE UNIT STRAPPED.

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.438
USUALLY ON THE BACKS OF A HOME

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.440
BUILDER LAND DEVELOPER. TO TO

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.008
TAKE CARE OF EVEN THOUGH.

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:04.243
I WE ALWAYS SAY IN OUR BUSINESS

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.345
THAT WE WE BRING FORWARD SUPPLY

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:07.947
AND AS YOU BRING FORWARD SUPPLY

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.748
DEMAND IS THE SAME.

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:11.483
ARE STAYS CONSTANT THEM PRICES

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.352
SHOULD GO DOWN BUT INCLUSIONARY

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:14.553
ZONING IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.589
DEAL WITH THAT IT'S DIFFERENT IN

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.757
MOST CITIES OF SOMEWHERE FROM.

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:19.625
SOME CITIES WHERE THEY DON'T

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.860
HAVE IT TO AS MUCH AS IS HIGHEST

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.996
25% --

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:26.332
INSURANCE ALONG WITH LIABILITY

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:28.200
WARRANTY IN DEFECT CLAIMS.

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:29.868
SOME PRODUCTS LIKELY SHE HOMES

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.570
WE BACK IN THE BUSINESS WE HAVE

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:33.005
FOR WHILE BUILDING TOWNHOMES AND

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.607
CONDOS BUT FOR MANY YEARS SINCE

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:35.774
SOME BILLS ARE STILL TODAY.

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:37.276
WON'T TOUCH THAT PRODUCT TYPE

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:38.777
BECAUSE OF THE IT LITIGIOUS

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.613
NATURE AND THE INSURANCE

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:41.647
REQUIREMENTS SOME BUILDERS IS

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.916
CAN YOU CAN SECURE INSURANCE TO

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:44.583
ALLOW THEM TO BRING THAT FORWARD

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.851
SO --

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:47.653
INSURANCE IS A DIFFICULT THING

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.621
FOR US TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:51.190
BECAUSE OF THE MANA LAWSUITS

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:52.224
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR INDUSTRY.

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.826
INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:56.095
UNDERSTANDING IN IN THIS SITE IN

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:56.929
THE AREA OF DOING BOTH THE

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:57.696
ENTITLEMENTS IN THE LAND

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:58.864
DEVELOPMENT WHAT IS THE

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:00.299
INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS WITH

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.667
BIGGER DEVELOPMENT SECOND EVEN

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.002
INCLUDE.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.637
I RECENTLY WAS PART OF A OF A

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.338
FREEWAY OVERPASS AND SO YOU HAVE

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:08.474
THE INTERCHANGES SOMETIMES TO

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.108
THE EXTENT OF THE COMMUNITY CAN

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:09.608
BE.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:11.277
SMALL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.145
REQUIREMENTS TO MAJOR MAJOR

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:14.513
IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN THE

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.047
INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:16.215
COMMUNITY.

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:19.018
LOOKING AT MATERIALS CURRENTLY

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:20.819
WITH TARIFFS WE ARE CONCERNED

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:22.154
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNKNOWN

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:23.522
RIGHT NOW WE'RE WATCHING LUMBER

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.057
HAS BEEN SPIKING --

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:25.658
OFFERED THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:28.360
FINALLY TALK ABOUT FOUR WEEKS

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.461
AGO AND IT SETTLED DOWN A LITTLE

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.229
BIT.

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.563
BUT LOOKING AT TERRACE

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.965
UNDERSTAND WITH THE STEEL

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:33.565
TARIFFS ARE GOING TO BE NEAR

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:35.067
INDUSTRY AND THE REASON I'M

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:35.934
GOING THROUGH ALL THIS IS FOR

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:37.169
YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ALL

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:38.470
THE DIFFERENT RISK FACTORS THAT

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:39.772
COME WITH.

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:42.408
WHAT WE DO YEAH I IN BOTH LAND

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:43.542
DEVELOPMENT HOME?

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.944
LABOR LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:48.414
WITH THE UNIONS OF FOCUSING ON

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.481
OUR INDUSTRY --

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:50.382
POTENTIALLY LOOKING FOR

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.618
PREVAILING WAGE --

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:55.754
THAT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE IF

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:56.822
WE GET TO THE POINT HAVING TO

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:59.525
PAY PREVAILING WAGES AS COMPARED.

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:00.793
TO A NORMAL WAGES THAT OULD

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:01.927
COME FROM WHETHER YOU'RE HIRING

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:03.796
A UNION OR NON YOU.

00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:04.797
WHEN YOU GET TO PREVAILING WAGES

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:06.432
I'VE EXAMPLES WHERE THE ADDED

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:08.467
COST CAN BE SO EXORBITANT THAT

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:09.668
THE PROJECT ITSELF JUST WON'T

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:11.770
PENCIL AT ALL --

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:13.339
CLOSING COSTS REALTORS

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:15.307
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE --

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.076
HOME FINANCE ALL THESE THINGS WE

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:19.044
NEED TO FOCUS ON TO MAKE SURE WE

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.980
WORK WITH THE OUT REALTORS IN

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:23.349
THE COMMUNITY SO THAT ONLY WERE

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.017
HIRING REALTORS TO SELL OUR

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:26.685
HOMES BUT THEN THERE'S REALTORS

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.053
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.321
BRINGING BUYERS TO US.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:30.756
AND SO WERE INTERFACING WITH

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.124
BOTH SIDES OF THE OF REAL TRUE

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:33.525
COMMUNITY.

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:35.561
AND THOSE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:37.629
FACTORS THAT ARE ARE THINGS THAT

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:39.198
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHATEVER

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:40.632
ANALYZE IN A PROJECT IN THIS IS

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:41.834
STILL A BIT OF A SUMMARY AN

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.302
ALTERNATE OVER.

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:44.536
TO DAVE STANCE AND NOW I THINK

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.438
WE'LL GIVE THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:47.072
A PROJECT WE WANT TO REVIEW WITH

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.217
A THIRD GENERATION FAMILY

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:33.552
BUILDER DEVELOPER AND I WAS

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.154
ALWAYS RAISED BY.

YOU'LL SEE ON MY FIRST PROJECT

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:44.496
IT'S NOT A PROJECT FOR THE

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:46.432
MASSES AND THAT IS JUST A BY

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:47.966
PRODUCT OF SOME OF THE THINGS

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.401
THAT WAYNE ADDRESSED --

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:51.870
IN THE BULLET POINTS --

AS WE CANDIDATE DUE TO TIME IN

THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES.

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.279
AND SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING AT

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:03.081
ANYTIME WITH MAYOR ANY OF THE

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.483

BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE THINGS

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.491
THAT WOULD JUST BE OVER MY HEAD --

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:14.159
TO WITH THAT SO MANY OF THESE

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:16.028
ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BOIL

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:17.563
DOWN INTO A QUICK SUMMARY AND OF

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:18.730
COURSE WERE ALWAYS.

THROUGH OUR CPA STAFF.

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:27.039
THE FIRST DEVELOPMENT THAT WE'RE

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.140
GONNA DISCUSS --

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:31.710
WAS THE COASTAL REGION WHICH A

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:32.945
LOT OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT OUR

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:34.112
COMPANY DOES --

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:36.081
BOTH INFILL AND GREEN FIELD

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:37.449
DEVELOPMENT IN THE COASTAL

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:39.218
REGION FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.686
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:42.454
THE PROJECT THAT WE'RE UTILIZING

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:43.489
TODAY HIS --

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:46.291
AND OF SMALL TOWN ABOUT TWENTY

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:47.292
MILES EAST OF SAN FRANCISCO.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:48.494
IT'S A TOWN THAT THAT OUR

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.964
COMPANY HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME --

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:52.531
EARLY ON IN MY CAREER IN THE

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:55.567
EIGHTIES AND AND THAT WE

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:56.802
DEVELOPED ALL AROUND THIS

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.437
PARTICULAR PROJECT THAT'S HOW I

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:00.005
HAD SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:01.573
AND ALMOST A TWENTY FIVE YEAR

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.708
HISTORY WITH THIS PARTICULAR TEN

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:04.643
ACRE PARCEL --

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.411
WE ULTIMATELY --

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:08.447
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OBTAIN

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.182
APPROVAL FOR AN EIGHTEEN UNIT

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:11.416
DEVELOPMENT ON THE*.

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:12.818
IT'S AT LITTLE OVER TEN ACRES

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:13.919
I'D INDICATED IN OUR AVERAGE

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.888
HOME SIZES AROUND TWENTY EIGHT

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:18.156
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET --

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:21.226
THE HISTORY REALLY STARTS OFF --

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.228
FOR ME AND FOLLOWING IT BUILDING

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:24.496
IN THE AREA AND TALKING IN THE

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:26.331
FAMILY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:27.399
THEN THEM DECIDING THAT THEY

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.401
WANTED TO SELL THE PROPERTY OVER

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:30.502
TWENTY YEARS AGO.

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:32.004
AND AT THE TIME --

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.006
UNDER THAT ARE TEN ZONING WHICH

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:35.407
IS TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET PER

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.642
LOT THIS SITE WOULD HAVE

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:38.043
TYPICALLY YIELDED ABOUT FORTY

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.311
UNITS.

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:41.713
AND THE PURCHASE PRICE THAT THAT

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.015
THEY ULTIMATELY WENT INTO

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:44.550
CONTRACT TO SELL IT FOR IS LAME

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:45.851
AND INDICATED.

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.853
WAS ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.621
SO JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:50.923
BECAUSE AS I MOVE FORWARD WITH

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:52.891
THIS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.226
AGO EVERYBODY ALWAYS THINKS REAL

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:56.028
ESTATE CALIFORNIA GOES UP UP UP

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.729
AND IT DOES FROM SOME REGARDS

00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:58.964
BUT THE ONLY THING IN OUR

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.098
EQUATION THAT USUALLY.

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:02.200
IS.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:04.836
FUNGIBLE OR FLEXIBLE IS HIS LAND

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:06.004
WE REALLY CAN'T CONTROL ARE

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:07.673
DIRECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS THE

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:08.974
FEES A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.075
WAYNE HAD INDICATED.

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:11.843
AND SO WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.412
THE ECONOMICS OF THESE DEALS THE

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:14.680
LAND IS REALLY THE FINAL

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:16.848
INGREDIENT AND BECOMING A VERY

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:19.551
SMALL PORTION OF WHAT WE DO --

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:22.387
THIS PROJECT IS A VERY IRONIC

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:24.656
BECAUSE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:26.258
LOOKED AT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:27.192
YEARS AGO I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:29.695
BEEN A PROJECT THAT WAS BUILT

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:30.429
FOR THE METAL.

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:32.064
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKFORCE

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.067
HOUSING AND A BEDROOM COMMUNITY --

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.468
THAT'S PLAYED A LOT A LOCAL JOBS

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.736
AND WHAT NOT.

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:39.304
AND JUST OVER TIME IS AS THINGS

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.073
HAVE EVOLVED IN IN OUR SOCIETY

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:42.808
TODAY IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:43.542
TO DO WITH THIS.

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.277
PACIFIC COMMUNITY IT'S VERY

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:46.478
TYPICAL IN EVERY TOWN IN

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.280
CALIFORNIA --

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:48.847
THE ENTITLEMENTS BECAME MUCH

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.149
MORE.

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:52.551
MUCH MORE.

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:54.519
COMPLEX IN THE YIELD AND THE

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.188
COST YIELD ONE DOWN COSTS WENT

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:58.223
UP SO WE'RE NOW AT ABOUT TWICE

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.358
THE MEDIAN COST OF THE

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:01.059
CALIFORNIA HOME.

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:03.495
ON THIS PARTICULAR SITE.

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:05.831
IF YOU LOOK AT THE AERIAL

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:08.433
PHOTOGRAPH WHICH IS ACTUALLY --

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.835
COMPUTER GENERATED RENDERING A

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:11.970
TENANT SPEAKS TO A THOUSAND

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:12.804
WORDS.

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:14.172
AS YOU CAN SEE THE HOMES ON THE

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.741
LEFT IN THE FEW HOMES UP IN THE

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.142
UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER IN THAT

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:19.778
BIG OPEN SPOT IN THE MIDDLE IS --

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.113
AS WAS.

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.247
AN AREA THAT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:23.949
JUST BEEN GREAT IN TERRACE LIKE

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.584
MOST --

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:26.885
DEMOGRAPHY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.553
WHERE YOU HAVE THAT INTRODUCED

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.022
HOUSING YOU YOU WORK THAT INTO

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:32.324
THE SITE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN.

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.760
AND IT REALLY SHOWS YOU AFTER

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:36.728
TWENTY YEARS OF EFFORT AND

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.430
SEVERAL DEVELOPERS THAT FAILED

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:40.032
PRIOR TO US.

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:42.300
HOWLE WHAT IT TAKES TO GET A

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:43.468
PROJECT APPROVING CALIFORNIA

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:45.904
TODAY THAT THIS BY A PARTICULAR

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:46.471
DEVELOPMENT WE WENT INTO THE

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:47.773
CITY?

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:49.374
KNOWING THE FAULTS FOR THE

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.776
FAILURES OF ALL THE PREVIOUS

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:52.511
DEVELOPERS STUDY IN THAT MEETING

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:53.645
WITH THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:56.214
TALKING TO THAT THE CITY STAFF

00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:57.616
AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:59.084
AND WE CAME AND ORIGINALLY WITH

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:00.385
THE PROJECT SIMILAR THIS IS A

00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:02.454
FEW MORE UNITS.

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.021
BUT WE CAN HELP BUT SHAVING

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:05.524
ANOTHER. 20% OFF OF THAT SO WHY

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.893
HERE WE ARE --

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.828
THIS GIVES YOU THE CONTEXT OF

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:11.663
WHERE THE PROJECTS IT'S IT'S

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.698
IT'S WHOLLY AN INFILL

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:14.800
DEVELOPMENT --

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:16.635
VERY INTENSE DEVELOPMENT ON ALL

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.370
SIDES FROM MEDIUM TO HIGH

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:20.072
DENSITY RESIDENTIAL ON THE

00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:21.640
WESTSIDE COMMERCIAL.

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:23.508
ON THE NORTH AND EAST SIDE AND

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:25.277
THEN SOME MEDIUM TO LOW DENSITY

00:22:25.343 --> 00:22:26.645
HOUSING --

00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:28.380
TO THE SOUTH IN MANY OF WHICH I

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:29.948
BUILT OVER THE YEARS --

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.684
AND THIS SITE JUST REMAIN AND

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:35.053
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE AERIAL MAP

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.354
AGAIN THAT THE GROSS

00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:38.023
INEFFICIENCY OF THE TEN ACRE

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.024
SITE.

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:40.992
AND A LESS THAN HALF OF THE

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:42.094
HOMES THAT ULTIMATELY COULD HAVE

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:42.394
[inaudible]

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:44.596
BEEN BUILT --

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:47.132
WHEN THIS PROPERTY ORIGINALLY I

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.633
WAS GOING TO BE DEVELOPED TWENTY

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.335
YEARS AGO AS I INDICATED THE

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:51.837
PURCHASE PRICE ON IT WAS A?

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:53.739
ROUGHLY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IF

00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:55.073
YOU TOOK THAT INTO TODAY'S

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:55.373
[inaudible]

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.143
AT NUMBERS AT TWO AND A HALF

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.011
PERCENT INFLATION TO BE ABOUT

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:01.913
SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.715
BECAUSE OF THE SELLERS SITUATION

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:05.984
HAD CHANGED AND THERE WERE SO

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:07.719
MANY EVOLUTIONS A FAILURE.

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.087
ALONG THE WAY WE'RE ABLE TO

00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:10.889
STRUCTURE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.557
UNDER A CONTRACT AGAIN AS LANDED

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:14.292
INDICATED --

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.627
THAT WAS.

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:16.962
VARIABLE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:18.563
LOTS THAT WE GOT FROM FROM THE

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.665
PROPERTY AND IT SCALED UP AND

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.134
DOWN SO THAT WE COULD STILL

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.935
REMAIN MOTIVATED TO TRY TO

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:25.203
GARNER WILL THE MAXIMUM

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.204
ENTITLEMENTS FROM THE

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:27.706
JURISDICTION THAT WE COULD.

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:28.240
THROUGH WORKING WITH THE

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:29.441
COMMUNITY.

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:31.076
BUT THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO BE

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:32.444
DISINCENTIVE EYES FROM FALLING

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:34.246
THROUGH IN CLOSING SO ULTIMATELY

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.714
WE CLOSED ON THIS PROPERTY THIS

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:38.016
YEAR FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS SO.

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.551
LESS THAN HALF OF TWENTY YEARS

00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:40.886
AGO.

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:43.121
LESSON A THIRD OF WHAT TODAY'S

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:44.923
NET PRESENT VALUE WOULD BE.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.424
BUT THE SELLERS WERE SO TIRED

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.226
SEVERAL HAD PASSED AWAY THE

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:50.095
ESTATE JUST WANTED TO LIQUIDATE

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:51.730
THE PROPERTY IN WE WERE

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.231
ULTIMATELY ABLE.

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:54.566
TO FIND THE RIGHT FORMULA THAT

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:56.902
WORK FOR EVERYBODY --

00:23:56.968 --> 00:23:58.036
AND THE INTERESTING THING WITH

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.538
OUR DEVELOPMENT IS --

00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:02.007
PROCESS IS IT ALWAYS BOILS DOWN

00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:03.809
TO FEASIBILITY AND AND LIKE MOST

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:05.977
BUSINESSES ITS TOP LINE BOTTOM

00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:06.545
LINE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.113
REVENUES WHAT WHAT EVEN AT AT

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.615
THE END AND AND CAN YOU REMAIN.

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:12.784
VIABLE AND PROFITABLE AND SO ALL

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:13.919
THE ISSUES THAT WAYNE HAD

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:15.821
BROUGHT UP WHICH WE CONSOLIDATED

00:24:15.887 --> 00:24:16.822
DRAMATICALLY FOR THIS

00:24:16.888 --> 00:24:18.290
PRESENTATION.

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:20.692
REALLY WOULD GO IN TO A COST

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:22.093
ANALYSIS WE HAVE TO TRY TO

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.196
PREDETERMINE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:26.531
THE THINGS THAT HE IDENTIFIED.

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:27.766
AND PUT A VALUE TO IT NOW

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:29.334
NORMALLY THIS IS ABOUT A TEN

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:31.670
PAGE EXCELS BREAD SHE PERFORMA

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:32.971
THAT WE ORIGINALLY WERE GOING TO

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:34.172
BURDEN YOU WITH BUT WE THOUGHT

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:35.874
YOU GLOSS OVER AND IN TWO

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.242
SECONDS AND AND I WANT WORK WE

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.778
BOILED IT DOWN. TO BASICALLY AT

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:41.746
TEN LINE ITEM PERFORMER FOR YOU

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:42.547
TO SHOW YOU KIND OF THE BASIC

00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:44.449
COMPONENTS --

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:46.885
BOTH NUMERICALLY AND WITH THE

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.353
PIE CHARTS YOU CAN REALLY SEE

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.622
THE DYNAMICS OF WHAT GOES INTO

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:52.490
CREATING A HOUSE.

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:54.159
AND MAKING A HOUSE VIABLE AND

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:56.361
THEN HOW YOU CAN ADJUST THAT TO

00:24:56.428 --> 00:24:57.596
TRY TO TWEAK IT TO MEET THAT THE

00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.497
MIDDLE CLASS.

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:01.166
SO -- AGAIN

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:02.934
ON ON THIS WHEN YOU CAN SEE FOR

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:05.170
EXAMPLE ON THIS COASTAL PROJECT.

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:06.605
OUR AVERAGE SALES PRICE FOR

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:08.273
THESE HOMES IS PROJECTED TO BE

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.275
LITTLE SHORT OF A MILLION TO ONE

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:10.942
ONE POINT ONE SIX MILLION

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.844
DOLLARS --

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.513
IF YOU TAKE THE PURCHASE PRICE

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.948
FOR THE LAND THAT I INDICATED

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:18.516
THAT IT WORKS OUT ABOUT A

00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:19.084
HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.986
DOLLARS A LOT.

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:22.454
THAT'S LESS THAN 10% OF THE

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.556
TOTAL COST OF THE HOUSE.

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:25.957
IN THE OLD DAYS YOU KNOW WE'VE

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:28.126
WE PAID AS MUCH AS 2030% FOR

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:29.327
LAND.

00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:30.762
BUT WEEK AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:32.864
COSTS IN THE DYNAMICS AND AND

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:34.766
WHAT NOT IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:37.102
AND A LOT OF THESE AREAS THE

00:25:37.168 --> 00:25:39.170
LAND COSTS IS THE ONLY VARIABLE

00:25:39.237 --> 00:25:41.373
THAT WE CAN GET. TO A POINT

00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:44.242
THAT'S ADJUSTABLE SO TO SPEAK

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:45.810
THAT WE CAN MAKE A PROJECT WORK.

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:47.078
BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:49.314
WILLING SELLER AND A LOT OF WHAT

00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:50.682
WE'RE FACED WITH THEM CHALLENGES

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:52.150
OF CREATING HOUSING TODAY'S WE

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.885
CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT PLAN WITH

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:55.186
THE RIGHT ZONING WITH THE RIGHT

00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:57.722
ECONOMICS. TO WORK WITH ALL THE

00:25:57.789 --> 00:26:00.525
OTHER FACTIONS COME INTO PLAY.

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:01.826
SO ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.361
AND IT WAS FAIRLY EFFICIENT TO

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:05.063
ENTITLE LEADER ACTUAL REAL

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.864
NUMBERS BY THE WAY THIS ISN'T

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:07.432
HYPOTHETICAL THIS PROJECT IS

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:08.934
UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND AND

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.435
CURRENTLY SELLING SO.

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:11.803
IT JUST WAS A GOOD COASTAL

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.172
EXAMPLE FOR ME. TO UTILIZE FOR

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:17.742
YOU TODAY BECAUSE OF THE REALITY

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.611
OF OF THE NUMBERS.

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:21.179
THE ENTITLEMENT COSTS AND THIS

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.748
ONE RELATIVELY LOW SOME PROJECTS --

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:26.051
WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER BUT TIME IS

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:28.486
EVERYTHING IN CALPERS ALONG THE

00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:30.455
WAY LOS.

00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:31.923
PROBABLY THREE TIMES THIS IN

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.191
ADDITION TO WHAT WE SPENT

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:34.192
BECAUSE THEY WOULD BRING FORTH

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.127
PROJECTS --

00:26:36.194 --> 00:26:37.829
APPLICATIONS OF THE CITY IN THEY

00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:39.431
WOULD GET REJECTED THEM THEN WE

00:26:39.497 --> 00:26:41.199
LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES AND

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:42.467
THEN MOVES WE CAME AND PRIDE

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:44.502
THIRD OR FOURTH LINE --

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:46.171
BUT DAY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE

00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:47.272
IT'S LITTLE LESSON TWENTY

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:49.207
THOUSAND DOLLARS A HOME.

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.775
SITE IMPROVEMENTS ON THIS ONE

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:53.244
ARE HORRIFIC --

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.346
TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE

00:26:54.412 --> 00:26:56.247
THOUSAND ARE ALMOST A QUARTER OF

00:26:56.314 --> 00:26:57.716
THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST.

00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:59.117
THIS SITE IMPROVEMENTS WILL YOU

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:01.019
SAW FROM THAT SITE PLAN VERY

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.120
INEFFICIENT PLANTS SINGLE LOADED

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:03.755
STREETS.

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:05.557
WHOLE LOT OFF SITE AND ONSITE

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:07.058
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SO RELATIVELY

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:08.693
FEW HOMES.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.562
IF YOU SIMPLY JUST LOOKED AT

00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:12.931
DOUBLING THE YIELD AND KEEPING

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:15.066
THE SITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS --

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:17.302
RELATIVELY THE SAME BECAUSE WE

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.103
HAVE TO PUT IN THE SAME STREETS

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:19.671
SAME IMPROVEMENTS.

00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:20.772
WE COULD HAVE DRAMATICALLY

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:22.674
BROUGHT THAT COST DOWN FOR THESE

00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:24.509
UNITS WILL IMMEDIATELY THINGS

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:26.311
LIKE THIS TAKE IT FROM BEING.

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:28.146
THE MIDDLE CLASS OR WORKFORCE

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:30.115
HOUSING PRODUCT AND IT PUSHES IT

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.816
FURTHER AND FURTHER UP.

00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:34.652
THE THE CHAIN OF BEING --

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.621
MORE OF AN EXECUTIVES DIALER

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:39.024
MANY MORE EXPENSIVE HOME FRANKLY

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.059
AND DOESN'T MEET THE MIDDLE.

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:43.661
MIDDLE LAST CLASS DESIGNATION.

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:45.330
PERMITS HERE AGAIN RIGHT DOWN

00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:46.331
THE MIDDLE FROM ONE LANE AND

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.999
INDICATED SEVENTY THOUSAND

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:49.200
DOLLARS --

00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:50.735
AND SOME OF THAT IS THAT FOR

00:27:50.802 --> 00:27:54.072
REASONS THAT I'LL GET INTO LATER --

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:55.774
WE DIDN'T PAY AN INCLUSIONARY

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.475
FEE HERE --

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:58.810
SCHOOL FEES ARE RELATIVELY

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:00.478
MODEST BECAUSE IT'S AN INFILL

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:01.980
DEVELOPMENT AND THERE WE

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:03.782
OBVIOUSLY ARE WHO FEES CAN

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.750
BECOME A HUGE VARIABLE FOR US

00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:07.285
AND IN EITHER WITH LEGISLATION

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.753
THAT CHANGES.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.322
OR CERTAIN SITUATIONS THAT ARISE

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:12.624
AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.659
NUMBERS SOMETIMES IT'S IS DEATH

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.428
BY A THOUSAND CUTS TO BUILD A

00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:18.029
HOUSE BECAUSE YOU CAN SAIL IT'S

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:19.664
A FEW THOUSAND HERE FEW THOUSAND

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:20.765
THERE BUT WHEN HE KEEPS GOING

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:21.933
THE WRONG WAY.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.102
YOU'LL SEE EVEN ON THIS PROJECT

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:26.071
EVEN THOUGH WE WENT THROUGH ALL

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:26.704
THREE STAGES WE DID THE

00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:28.807
ENTITLEMENT.

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.508
WE DID A LAND DEVELOPMENT AND

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:31.376
WHERE THE MERCHANT BUILDER

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:32.911
BUILDING THE HOMES.

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:34.979
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS STILL

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:38.049
BELOW THE INDUSTRY MINIMUM BUT

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.717
WE WERE SO FAR COMMITTED TO IT --

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:42.020
WE DECIDED TO GO FORWARD HOPING

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:44.322
FOR THE BEST BUT THAT THE

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:47.025
BUILDER AND MATT PRETAX.

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:48.426
THAT'S BELOW THE MINIMUM

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:50.361
STANDARD THAT THAT AN FDIC

00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:52.263
INSURED BANK WILL GENERALLY GO

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.099
INTO A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT

00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:56.367
PROJECT BECAUSE OF ALL THE RISKS

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:57.836
THAT WAYNE IDENTIFIED.

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.704
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG THE

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:01.673
NUMBERS CAN YOU IMMEDIATELY A

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.108
ROAD THAT BUILDER NET.

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.609
AND SO THE BANK DOESN'T WANT TO

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:06.010
TAKE OVER THE PROJECT AND TRY TO

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.545
FIND SOMETHING THAT WE WEREN'T

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:08.947
ABLE TO DO SO --

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:11.416
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.984
PROJECTS WHETHER WERE.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:15.820
PUBLIC OR PRIVATE LIKE OURSELVES.

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:18.890
THE AND THAT'S REASONABLY

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.825
SUSTAINABLE FOR THE RISK AND THE

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:22.594
OTHER THINGS --

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.629
INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS.

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:26.531
BY THE DIRECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:27.465
AGAIN.

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:30.001
PRETTY TYPICAL 25% BUT THINGS

00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:32.871
LIKE TERRORISTS LABOR SHORTAGES

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:34.038
ALL KINDS OF THINGS CAN JUST

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:36.541
SWING THOSE DRAMATICALLY AND WE

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:37.609
REALLY HAVE TO GO INTO THESE

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:39.043
PROJECTS BEING ABLE TO

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.411
ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR COST

00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:41.746
LUMBER TARIFFS THAT JUST WENT

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:42.714
INTO EFFECT.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.582
IS ADDED FIFTEEN THOUSAND

00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:45.150
DOLLARS ON THE COST OF THIS

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:47.118
HOUSE WE DON'T GET ANYTHING MORE

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:49.420
FOR IT WE CAN'T SELL IT FOR MORE.

00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:50.889
EDGES LOWERS THE PROBABILITY.

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:52.590
SELLING COSTS VERY BASIC I NEW

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:53.658
HOMES IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO RE

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:54.993
SALE.

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:56.528
AND THE SOFT COSTS ARE

00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:58.029
EVERYTHING THAT IT TAKES TO PUT

00:29:58.096 --> 00:29:59.430
A DEVELOPMENT TOGETHER THIRD

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:01.099
PARTY CONSULTANTS.

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:03.768
OUR OFFICE JEAN AN OVERHEAD --

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:06.171
POLL ALL THE OTHER --

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:07.906
BACKROOM BACK OFFICE JOB SITE

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:09.607
SUPERVISION YOU KNOW ALL THE

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:11.242
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ALL LUMPED

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:13.144
INTO ONE FIFTEEN AND A HALF

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.479
PERCENT IS RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:16.214
OF INDUSTRY NORMS --

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:18.716
DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT AND

00:30:18.783 --> 00:30:19.951
THEN OF COURSE FINANCE COSTS.

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:22.854
SO YOU CAN SEE HERE ON A PRE TAX

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:25.256
IT COMES OUT TO JUST BELOW 10%

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:26.624
DOING ALL THREE PHASES OF THE

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:28.593
DEVELOPMENT AN AFTER TAX.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.161
WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT A 5%

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:32.230
RETURN SO WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:33.898
DONE THAT WE HAVE IF EVERYTHING

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:35.433
GOES PERFECTLY TO REINVEST IN

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.701
HAVING THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:37.268
ANOTHER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:37.569
[inaudible]

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:39.504
FOREIGN.

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.172
SO THAT'S OUR GOAL FOR SURVIVAL.

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:43.141
AND I THINK THAT --

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.008
YOU KNOW THERE'S MANY OTHER

00:30:44.075 --> 00:30:46.177
FACTORS WITH THE INCLUSIONARY

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:48.146
AND DENSITY THAT YOU CAN SEE

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.614
THAT JUST LITTLE.

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:50.381
THINGS WITH DANCE IF YOU DOUBLE

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:53.251
THE DANCE REALLY BROUGH AND THE

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:54.686
IN THE AFFORDABILITY ON A

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:57.288
PROJECT LIKE THIS MAYBE 3040%

00:30:57.355 --> 00:31:00.358
FROM A MILLION TO DOWN THE SEVEN

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:01.259
HUNDRED THOUSAND INCLUSIONARY

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:02.760
HOUSING CAN JUST BE A DISASTER.

00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:04.329
FOR THE PROJECT OUT LIKE THAT

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:06.064
BECAUSE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.799
IT'S A SEVEN EIGHT HUNDRED

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:08.466
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUSE

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.568
SUBSIDIES SO --

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:11.936
LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE MORE

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.137
WITH YOU BUT I KNOW MY TIME IS

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:14.505
LIMITED.

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:15.540
IF I MAY.

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:16.741
BECAUSE I WANNA KNOWLEDGE THE

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:18.376
PRESENCE OF US SOME NUMBERS

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:20.211
BERMAN SANTIAGO AND AND IS THEN

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:21.212
THE SOME NUMBER FRIEDMAN WHO I

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:21.813
BELIEVE WILL COME BACK IN A

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.081
MOMENT.

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:23.715
IF WE MAY TAKE A COUPLE QUICK

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:24.949
QUESTIONS WHICH I THINK SOME OF

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:26.584
THE FINANCIAL PRINCIPLES WILL.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:27.885
APPLY ACROSS THE DIFFERENT

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:29.454
SCENARIOS I THINK THAT THE

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.054
DIGITAL SCENARIOS ARE REALLY

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:32.156
MEANT TO BE CONTEXT SENSITIVE

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.625
RIGHT -- IN

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:34.626
A DIFFERENT ONE BECAUSE MY

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:35.793
COLLEAGUES HAS QUESTIONS BUT

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.929
JUST TO KIND OF TOP WHITE IT FOR

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:39.931
FOLKS -- IS

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:41.933
HE SAID THESE HOUSES SOLD THAT

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.600
THE WHITE HOUSE ARE THE POSSIBLY

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.702
IN SEOUL SO THE ONE POINT ONE

00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:45.937
AND MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE IS

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:47.405
WHAT FOLKS ARE SELLING THESE

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:48.906
PROPERTIES THESE HOMES FOR TODAY

00:31:48.973 --> 00:31:49.841
RIGHT.

00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:51.809
AND WHAT I THINK IS OFTEN LOST

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:53.244
ON FOLKS WHEN THEY THEY THINK

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:53.878
ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES ACTUALLY

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.046
BUILD A HOUSE THEY USUALLY JUST

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:56.281
START THINKING ABOUT THE DIRECT

00:31:56.347 --> 00:31:57.048
CONSTRUCTION RIGHT THERE

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:58.383
THINKING ABOUT STICKS AND BRICKS

00:31:58.449 --> 00:31:59.717
AND THAT KIND OF STUFF.

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.052
WHICH IS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.420
ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT RIGHT.

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.355
ABOUT THEN THIS THIS SLIDE IS

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:05.657
REALLY DID ILLUSTRATE ALL THE

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:07.025
ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT.

00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:08.293
YOU KNOW DEPEND HOW GAUGE

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:09.694
JORDAN'S PROCESS --

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.095
YOU MAY NOT BE EXACTLY WHERE OF

00:32:11.162 --> 00:32:13.064
CRACKED CORRECT NOW UNDERSTOOD

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:14.832
THE PROJECT THIS WASN'T SUBJECT

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:15.700
TO PUT WAS A SUBJECT PREVAILING

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:19.504
WAGE NO SIR CARVE OUR APPEAL A

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:20.138
OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE NONE

00:32:20.204 --> 00:32:21.639
AT ALL.

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:22.607
AND THAT'S ALWAYS A RUN BY WHAT

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.042
TIME OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:24.842
UNDERSTANDABLY Y. WITH ONE

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:25.810
ENCOURAGE JOBS THAT ARE IN THAT

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:27.011
IN THAT AREA WHAT'S IN TIME THE

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:28.613
RUB AGAINST WHAT THAT MAY DO TO

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.280
SELL COST.

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:30.481
UNITS A TUG IN THE PUSH AND PULL

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:32.016
THE DECISION MAKERS LIKE US HAVE

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:33.618
TO DEAL WITH --

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:36.020
BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THIS

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:38.356
A MILLION FELL PRICES ABSENT

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:41.092
THAT PARTICULAR REQUIREMENT --

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.094
SHE'D JUST HIT A IN A CLOSE RACE

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:44.262
OF EVEN WITHOUT THOSE

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:45.263
REQUIREMENTS ARE STILL TALKING

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.131
WELL BEYOND WHAT ANYONE CAN WHAT

00:32:47.198 --> 00:32:49.500
AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:51.569
RIGHT THAT'S FOR AUNT THAT WITH

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:52.870
REGARD TO THAT THE SIZE OF THE

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:55.440
UNIT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:56.808
223-500-2000 TO THIRTY FIVE

00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:57.275
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET.

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.377
HOMES WHEN WHEN THEY ADDITIONAL

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:01.012
THAT VISUAL DENSITY WAS LIKE

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:02.246
FORTY UNITS THAT WE SAID.

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:03.815
WHAT DOES WHAT IT WOULD HAVE

00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:05.283
BEEN AT THIS SIZE WOULD DAY

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.919
ABSOLUTELY IF I IF I HAD THE

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:09.354
ABILITY I WOULD HAVE GONE INTO

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.488
MORE DETAIL BUT IF WE WERE TO

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:11.656
BUILD THIS IS A FORTY UNIT

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:13.458
DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY THE AVERAGE

00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:14.392
SIZE?

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:16.060
AVERAGE SIZE YEARS TWENTY EIGHT

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:16.694
HUNDRED WE PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:19.564
AROUND.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.098
TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THREE

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:20.732
HUNDRED AND WHEN YOU TAKE THE

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:21.899
REDUCTION OF ALL THOSE LINE ITEM

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:23.701
COSTS IN THE DIRECT CONSTRUCTION

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:24.302
COSTS.

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:25.903
WE COULD HAVE PROBABLY SOLD AT

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.639
HOME FOR AROUND [inaudible]

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:29.107
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:29.907
INTERESTING WHICH IS STILL

00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:32.443
HIGHER RELATIVE.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.178
TO THE MIDDLE FOR THE MEDIAN IN

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:36.381
CALIFORNIA AROUND.

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:37.215
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT IT'S

00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:39.384
40% MORE ATTAINABLE FOR THAT

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.485
MUCH LARGER OF A POPULATION

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.387
SEGMENT WHERE HOUSING IS SO

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:43.654
BADLY NEEDED IN THIS REGION.

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:45.156
YEAH FOR PUTS A FEW MORE PEOPLE

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:46.724
IN THE NEXT THAN THAN ONE POINT

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.025
ONE MILLION AYE CORRECT NOW

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:49.727
THAT'S THAT WOULD USE COSTS IS

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:50.628
EVEN TRUE.

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:51.763
EVEN IF YOU HAD TO SORT OF LEVEL

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:54.165
OFF THE POT ARTIST THE

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:55.166
TOPOGRAPHY SO EVEN I MENTIONED

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:57.268
THAT'S NOT CHEAP --

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.003
CLOSE SO EVEN THAT WE STILL HAVE

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.838
A SEVERELY REDUCED.

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:04.008
COST MEAN ABSENT YOU SAID SEVEN

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:04.976
HUNDRED THOUSAND IS ABOUT WHICH

00:34:05.042 --> 00:34:05.143
IS.

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:06.110
THAT WE WILL HOLD ANY PARTICULAR

00:34:06.177 --> 00:34:08.513
FIGURE WITHOUT A BALLPARK RIGHT --

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:10.515
AND THAT WAS A SORT OF A OF A

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.883
GOING TO THE POLITICAL PROCESS

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:13.151
OF SEE COUNCIL HEARINGS

00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:14.886
COMMUNITY CHARAX THAT KIND OF

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:16.120
STUFF THAT GOT YOU TO THE NUMBER

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:17.789
OF UNITS OF THIS ULTIMATELY WAS

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.090
THAT'S CORRECT INTERESTING.

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:20.391
WHAT THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:21.325
AND THEN AGAIN I HOPE IT BECAUSE

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:22.894
ANY QUESTIONS AND GRATEFUL FOR

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.062
THEIR TIME AND PRESENTS --

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:29.667
IT WE OFF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUTSMALLER UNITS CLOSER AND NOW ONE

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:30.568
OF THINGS I JUST CARE FACILITIES

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.136
IN THE INDUSTRY IS SMALLER

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:34.005
NECESSARILY CHEAPER AND I MEAN I

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:35.573
I WHEN LOOKING AT ALL THE NON

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.275
CONSTRUCTION COSTS THAT GO INTO

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.843
THE FINAL SALES PRICE.

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:39.710
YOU KNOW ARE WE ON THE RIGHT

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:40.912
TRACK FOR REALLY TRYING TO LOOK

00:34:40.978 --> 00:34:43.080
AT YOU KNOW SMALLER HOMES --

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:45.116
CONDENSER UNITS A MICRO UNITS

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.617
THINGS THAT NATURE ARE IS THAT

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:47.852
ABOUT SIX OF ONE HALF OF THE

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.620
OTHER BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO

00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:51.722
PAY THE FEES ARE STILL HAVING.

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:53.624
TO BUILD THE ROADS ETCETERA.

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:55.693
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.961
A HIGH IT WAS A BILL THERE'S A

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:57.662
RULE OF THUMB THAT I I KNEW THAT

00:34:57.728 --> 00:34:59.163
QUESTION WAS GONNA COME UP AND

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.032
AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE WILL

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:03.301
PROBABLY HAVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:04.268
FOR A IT IT.

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:06.370
IT DEPENDS OBVIOUSLY IS IS THE

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.606
TRUE ANSWER BUT IN MOST CASES

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:10.441
YES ONE ONE WE HAVE.

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:12.743
SITES THAT ARE GROSSLY UNDER

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.178
UTILIZED LIKE THIS IT

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:16.113
DRAMATICALLY CHANGES THE OVERALL

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.615
COST BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE.

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:20.451
PROCESSING THAT I I CAN PROCESS

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:22.220
EIGHTEEN LOTS AS EASILY AS I CAN

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.354
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY LOTS I CAN.

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.323
I HAVE THE SAME STAFF THE SAME

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:26.891
OVERHEAD --

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.826
THE SAME RELATIVE EFFORT THAT

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.328
GOES INTO IT AND THEN WHEN YOU

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:31.762
CAN REDUCE.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.097
EVERYONE OF THESE LINE ITEMS IS

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:34.332
JUST BE MORE EFFICIENT IT'S

00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:36.067
KINDA LIKE THE FOR HER THE GM

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:38.269
MODEL OF BUILDING CARS.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:40.238
YOU YOU BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:42.139
HOUSING BY EFFICIENCY AND

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:43.374
PRODUCTIVITY.

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.610
NOT BY TRYING TO BUILD SEMI

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:47.378
CUSTOM HOMES.

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:51.849
AND AND SO DENSITY DOES HELP. TO

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.684
A CERTAIN LEVEL WHAT ONCE YOU

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:55.920
GET AND IS SUPER DANCE STUFF

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.489
WHERE YOU'RE GONE FROM THREE TO

00:35:58.556 --> 00:35:59.490
SIX TO TWELVE STORIES.

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:00.591
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:02.093
LAYERS OF ECONOMICS IN THAT

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:03.427
WHERE THEY INCREASE INCREMENTAL

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:05.796
DIRECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS GET.

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:07.798
SO MUCH GREATER IT'S IT'S TIED

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:09.901
TO A REAL ESTATE VALUE AGAIN BUT

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.235
FOR THE MOST PART.

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:13.471
WITH THAT THE TYPE OF HOUSING

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:14.472
THAT WERE REFERRING TO AND

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:15.973
THAT'S IT WOULD HAVE HELPED

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.475
IMMENSELY INTIMATELY INVOLVED

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:18.809
QUESTION IS I THINK SOMETIMES

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:20.311
PEOPLE SAY BACK WHEN WE'RE

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:21.679
ADVOCATING FOR SMALL UNITS OF

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:22.847
THERE'S NOT A MARKET FOR THAT

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:24.382
BUT YOU COULD HAVE SOLD THESE.

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:26.317
JUST AS EASILY AT TWENTY ONE

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:26.984
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AS YOU COULD

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:28.286
AT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:29.253
FEET MUCH EASIER THEY'RE

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.389
ACTUALLY THE DEMAND IS SO MUCH

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:33.157
GREATER FOR THOSE BECAUSE AGAIN.

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.258
YOU'RE BUILDING FOR THE MASSES

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:36.027
AS MY FATHER TAUGHT ME YOU'RE

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:37.828
NOT TRYING TO PICK OFF THAT

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:39.063
UPPER AND THEY GET A HIGHER

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.265
PROFIT NET PROFIT PER UNIT HERE

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:42.433
TRYING.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.935
TO CREATE HOUSING WHERE THERE'S

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:46.103
A BIGGER MARKET A BIGGER POOL

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.706
WHICH IS THE MIDDLE.

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:50.007
WE TALK ABOUT SMALL A DETACHED.

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:50.641
I'M TRYING TO DEVELOP RIGHT NOW

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:53.778
IN THAT SIXTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:54.278
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT.

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:56.013
PRODUCT AMOUNT MOUND HOUSE WITH

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.748
FOUR PROPERTIES THAT WERE ZONED

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.450
FOR ATTACHED WITH THE OR

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.885
DUPLEXES OR TOWNHOMES.

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:01.852
AND I'M WORKING WITH THE COUNTY

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.955
RIGHT NOW TO GET ALL REZONED A

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.289
SMALL LOT DETACHED.

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:06.424
BECAUSE THE COST NOW FOR

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.025
DELIVERING THAT IS SO MUCH

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:09.260
CHEAPER.

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:10.361
AND THEN IT'S ALSO HAD IN THE

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:12.196
PRICE POINT OF AFFORDABILITY

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:12.763
THAT WOULD BE BEST FOR THAT

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:13.698
MARKET.

00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:15.666
AND SO THAT REALLY IS THE KIND

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.435
OF THE SWEET SPOT ANOTHER GOOD

00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:19.971
THING TO FOCUS ON IS IS A GRANNY

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:22.373
FLATS OR MULTI GEN HOUSING WHERE

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.108
WE CAN ADD A UNIT TO A SET A

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:25.676
STANDARD SO ELECT ON THESE HOMES

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:26.577
THAT.

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:28.346
DAVE TALKING ABOUT HERE THOSE

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:30.047
HOMES COULD HAD A AT IT

00:37:30.114 --> 00:37:31.582
EXHILARATING UNIT.

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:32.850
THAT YOU CAN EITHER RAN ORG

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:35.353
EFFORT.

00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:37.154
BACK THAT'S ANOTHER THING TO

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:37.788
REALLY FOCUS ON FOR FOUR IN THE

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:38.456
STATE [inaudible]

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:39.557
COOL [inaudible]

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:42.660
A MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OF

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:44.996
BEFORE I MOVE ON THE NEXT.

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:46.464
NINE SURE PRESENCE AND THAT ONE

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.898
THING CHAIR GLORIA --

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:49.266
FOR ORGANIZING TODAY'S HEARING

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.134
ARE PRESENT --

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:51.669
THE SILICON VALLEY WHERE I WISH

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:52.870
I COULD BUY HOME FOR ONE POINT

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.972
ONE MILLION DOLLARS --

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:56.774
AND AND BUT AND THIS IS A CRISIS

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.110
IT'S AFFECTING THE ENTIRE STATE

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:01.112
AND ITS LARGELY A SUPPLY PROBLEM.

00:38:01.178 --> 00:38:02.013
THAT WE HAVE SO APPRECIATE YOUR

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:02.780
COMMENT.

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:04.115
AND EXPLAINING SOME THE COSTS OF

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:05.916
JUST GOING BACK TO THE THE

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:07.084
ABBREVIATED PRO FORMA THE

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:10.121
PROVIDED FOR US --

SO THIS DID NOT INCLUDE

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.690
PREVAILING WAGE IT ALSO I'M

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:17.428
ASSUMING DID NOT INCLUDE --

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:18.863
IBM ARE.

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:21.499
NO. OH IF IF IF IF YOU DID HAVE

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:23.734
MORE UNITS PER ACRE DO YOU THINK

00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:24.468
THOUGH.

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:25.436
THAT THE SUICIDE PERMITS WERE

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:26.971
GONE DOWN PER UNIT BUT DO YOU

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:28.806
THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO PAY MORE

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.574
FOR THE LAND.

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:31.475
POSSIBLY IT WOULD TO WHICH

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:33.678
BROUGHT IT WOULDN'T OF EVEN

00:38:33.744 --> 00:38:34.645
DOUBT BUT IT.

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:36.480
WOULD HAVE BEEN A FACTOR --

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:39.884
GOING TO LABOR BECAUSE WAS ALSO

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:40.885
WOULD --

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:42.653
HAVING THIS SUMMER SO IT SPOKE

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.721
ABOUT -- ARE

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.256
YOU GUYS FACING A LABOR SHORTAGE

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:46.157
AT ALL ARE YOU SEEING THAT

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:47.525
ESPECIALLY NO.

00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:49.593
LA FIRES AND DOCTOR WOODS

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.328
DISTRICT IN MY AND THOSE ARE ON

THAT -- BY

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:55.633
IS THAT IMPACTING YOUR ABILITY.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.968
TO TO BUILD THAT LABOR SHORTAGES

00:38:58.035 --> 00:38:59.403
AND AND TRAIN LABOR.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:00.771
DRAMATICALLY AFFECTING OUR

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:02.506

MUCH LONGER TO DELIVER THAT

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:14.351
PRODUCT WHICH THEN ANALYZE WITH

00:39:14.418 --> 00:39:15.453
INCREASING OUR DIRECT

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:16.987
CONSTRUCTION COSTS USER LABOR

COSTS ARE GOING UP IN INCREASES

00:39:18.422 --> 00:39:19.924
ARE FINANCING COSTS BECAUSE IT'S

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.659
BURKE TRACKING THE TIME TO DO.

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:22.026
IT --

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:24.128
INCREASE JUST ABOUT EVERY LINE

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:27.865

DOING OUR INVESTIGATION AND

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.343
THERE WERE THERE WERE A FEW

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.878
THINGS ON THE SITE DEVELOPMENT

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:22.446
SIDE THAT WERE?

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:25.149
KIND OF BIG UNKNOWNS WITH STREET

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:25.983
WITH SUN.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.719
WATER AND AND OTHER UTILITY

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.421
ADEQUACY BECAUSE CODES OF CHANGE

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:31.322
WITH FIRE SPRINKLERS YOU MAY

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:33.190

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:34.592
THINGS IN THOSE ANSWERS EARLY ON

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.060
WEREN'T THERE THEY MIGHT BE

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:37.027
THERE BY NOW.

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:40.231
BUT ARE OUR MAIN ISSUE.

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:42.199
AND WHY WE DECLINED.

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:44.168
PURSUE IT WITH THE INDIVIDUAL

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:45.769
HOMEOWNERS INSTEAD OF WHERE WE

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.171
GOING TO BUY ONE PIECE A LAND WE

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:48.806
BUILD ALL THE HOMES.

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:50.507
WAS BECAUSE WE HAD NO WAY TO

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:53.811
PROTECT OUR BECAUSE AND WHEN

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:55.212
WHEN WE WENT UP THERE WE WENT TO

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:56.814
EVERYONE OF OUR TRADE PARTNERS

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.215
WHETHER THEY WERE UNION NON

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.750
UNION WHATEVER IT WAS AND ALL OF

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.218
OUR SUPLIERS AND WE SAID OKAY

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:03.087
LISTEN WE WE HAVE. TO REBUILD

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:04.889
THESE HOMES WANTED TO FIFTY OR A

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.423
HUNDRED AT A TIME.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.726
AND WHAT'S GONNA TAKE WHAT DO

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:09.727
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO GET FROM HERE

00:42:09.793 --> 00:42:13.964
TO PAY HERE YOUR LABOR GO.

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:14.965
TO THE NORTH BAY TO REBUILD

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.500
THESE HOMES.

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:19.403
AND THE ANSWER WAS WE CAN'T OR

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.572
WE WON'T EVER WE CAN'T GIVE YOU

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:24.041
A NUMBER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:25.342
FACED.

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:27.044
WITH A BUNCH OF DISAPPOINTED

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.746
HOMEOWNERS A YEAR OR TWO DOWN

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:29.914
THE ROAD WHERE THEY SETTLED WITH

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.149
THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY FOR ACTS.

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:34.652
AND I'M HAVING TOPAY AX PLUS TO

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.120
BUILD THEIR HOME.

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:37.621
BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:39.757
THE COST AND THEN THEY CAN'T

00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:40.925
FINISH THEIR HOME.

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:42.927
I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER TO LET

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:44.361
THEM KNOW I'M SORRY WE CAN'T

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.030
PREDICT YEAR AND COST.

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.598
AS MUCH AS THEY WANTED US TO

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:49.199
SIGN A CONTRACT.

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:49.867
AND GIVE THEM A FIXED FEE AND I

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:52.937
WOULD LIKE TO UNDER NORMAL

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:54.738
STANCE POSSIBLY WE COULD.

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.507
BUT WE COULDN'T AND I DON'T WANT

00:42:56.573 --> 00:42:58.075
TO BE THAT GUY IN THE NEWSPAPER

00:42:58.142 --> 00:42:58.709
COUPLE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WHERE

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:00.377
WE HAVE A BUNCH OF UPSET

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:01.845
HOMEOWNERS.

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.314
WHEN WE'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE?

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.082
AND WE FIND OUT THAT THEY CAN'T

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:06.650
AFFORD TO FINISH THE WHOLE.

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:08.218
SO THAT REALLY WAS THE ISSUE WE

00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:10.287
COULD NOT GET LABOR TO GO UP

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:11.155
THERE ON A ON A LARGE SCALE

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:12.122
PRODUCTION.

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:15.726
AT ANY PRICE.

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.094
PETS WE'VE WE'VE WHY I'VE HEARD

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.829
FROM OTHERS THAT THERE WERE SOME

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:19.897
PEOPLE HAVE SAID WELL THERE IS

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:21.332
AN ADEQUATE LABOR SUPPLY AND AND

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:26.637
AND AND AND YOU WERE ABLE.

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:27.438
TO THAT WHAT THAT WASN'T THE WAY

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:29.106
YOU SAW IT FROM YOUR PER.

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:30.274
AND AND I WENT TO THE PEOPLE

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.942
THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY REFERRING

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.544
THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE LABOR

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.778
SUPPLY.

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:35.713
AND WHEN I REALLY ASK THEM TO

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.748
SIGN A CONTRACT WITH ME BEFORE I

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:38.482
WOULD SIGN A CONTRACT WITH THE

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:44.888
HOMEOWNERS A WHEN.

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.223
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING VERY

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.725
DIFFICULT SITUATION AND I

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:48.692
THOUGHT THAT THE HOMEOWNERS

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:49.994
DESERVE TO KNOW IN ADVANCE SO

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:50.561
THEY CAN MOVE ON WITH THEIR

00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:51.562
LIVES.

00:43:51.628 --> 00:43:53.764
WE BUILD HOMES FOR A LIVING.

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:54.865
THEY NEED TO GET ON WITH THEIR

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:56.367
LIVES AND THE I JUST THOUGHT

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.968
THAT DRAGGING THEM OUT TWO OR

00:43:58.035 --> 00:44:00.337
THREE YEARS AND UNPREDICTABLE ON

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:02.906
FEASIBLY FINANCIAL SITUATION

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:05.476
WASN'T THE FAIREST THING TO DO.

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:06.477
FOR EVEN THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.412

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:22.319
PERMITS YEAH.

HAVE ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF TO

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:32.963
MEET TWO YEARS TO GO BEFORE WE

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.931

SO AROUND AND I I WILL TELL YOU

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:37.734
WHEN I FIRST STARTED ON THIS

PROJECT --

00:45:39.169 --> 00:45:40.270
WE TALKED ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:42.239
USER BUYER AND WE REALIZED AT

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:43.941
THAT TIME THAT THEY WERE ABOUT

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:46.110
FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WELL DON'T

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:48.579
GROW MOST THIRTY SO.

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:50.681
WE WOULD IN THE HOME BY MARKET --

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:52.082

BAY AGAIN --

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:54.952
YOU KNOW THE LAND PORTION OF IT

00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:56.620
IS LAND TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE

00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:59.256
WE DEAL WITH WE LONG TERM DEALS

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:01.225
ON THIS AND WE WANT OFF THE EDGE

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.960
OF THOSE DEALS AND I'VE GOTTEN

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:04.061
GOOD AT TERROR.

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:05.562
RENEGOTIATING THOSE TO MAKE IT

00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:06.897
TO THIS POINT B. IN FRONT OF YOU

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:09.032

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:11.568
TO TALK ABOUT --

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.303
BEN AND I'D LIKE TO GO BACK --

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.404
TO THE SMALLER MAKING A

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.607
DIFFERENCE IN COST AROUND AND

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.108
AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:20.110
MASTER PLAN BY DEVELOPED AN

00:46:20.177 --> 00:46:22.179
AXIOM IN LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:23.013
PROJECTS THAT ARE BENT ON

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.081
OVERTIME.

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:25.282
AND IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:27.084
MATTER IF IT'S FIVE HUNDRED

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.986
UNITS A THOUSAND UNITS OR TEN

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:29.586
THOUSAND UNITS.

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:31.288
IF THEY ALL COST ABOUT TEN TO

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:31.822
TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:33.257
ENTITLE.

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:35.526
I DON'T KNOW WHY DOES IT JUSTICE.

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:38.595
AND AND THE MOST THE SMALLER MAY

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:39.963
YES ON THE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.965
A GEOGRAPHIC SENSITIVITY TO THAT

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:43.400
IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.801
THAT PARTICULAR MARKET.

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:47.371
POWER AND THAT'S KIND OF WORLD

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:50.507
DO WE GO NEXT MESS --

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:52.676
CLOSING THE THIS THE SITE PLAN

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.244
FOR WELL FOR THE PROJECT AS

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.145
MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE RUNNING

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:56.346
THROUGH IT ANOTHER ONE OF THE

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:57.814
THINGS IT'S A COMMON.

00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:00.350
THEME OF NO WHERE ARE THE BIG

00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:01.785
COSTS THAT HIT A PROJECT AND AND

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:03.353
AND A BULLS FOUNDER ECONOMIES OF

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.922
SCALE MUCH LIKE MISTER SIMPSON

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.356
WAS TALKING ABOUT ON A ON A

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:09.326
DIFFERENT SCALE.

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:10.694
AROUND.

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:11.495
THE COST OF THE MAJOR ROADS

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:12.162
RUNNING THROUGH THERE IT DOESN'T

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:13.497
MATTER IF YOU HAD NO FIVE

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:15.666
HUNDRED UNITS SIR. FIVE THOUSAND

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:16.633
UNITS YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE TO

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.834
BUILD A BIG ROAD THAT RUNS

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:18.902
THROUGH IT SO.

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:19.970
THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE MAKES A

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:21.872
BIG DIFFERENCE [inaudible]

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:23.574
TOM [inaudible]

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.742
ENVIRONMENTAL NEAR.

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:27.511
ENVIRONMENTAL OUR COSTS ARE ON

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:28.478
THIS PROJECT IT'S ABOUT SIX

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:31.882
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ACRES GROSS

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.383
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED ACRES THAT'S

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:34.751
NOT DEVELOPED AND WE'RE STILL

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:37.221
HAVE TO GO OUT AND SECURE SIX

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:38.488
HUNDRED FORTY ACRES OF OFFSITE

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:40.123
MITIGATION.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.693
SUPPORT IS SO THINK ON YOUR ROOF.

00:47:42.759 --> 00:47:44.728
TUNE IN TO TWO AND A HALF TIMES

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:46.697
WHATEVER DEVELOPMENT AREAS IS

00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:47.264
WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:48.999
SECURE SORRY I'M JUST A LITTLE

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.500
CONFUSED BY THE PRESENTATION I

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:51.768
WANT TO BE SURE UNDERSTANDING

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:53.437
BECAUSE YOU SAY A HUNDRED UNITS

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:54.605
BUT THEN YOU JUST MENTION A

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:55.639
COUPLE THOUSAND SO ARE.

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:57.608
USES A PART OF A CONTINUATION OF

00:47:57.674 --> 00:47:59.176
AN OLDER DEVELOPMENT IS NOT WHAT

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:00.077
YOUR NO SIR BRAND NEW

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:01.612
DEVELOPMENT IT'S PART IT'S

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.780
BROUGH WOULD BE WHAT ONE HUNDRED

00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:06.350
UNITS WOULD BE WITH IN THE THREE

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:07.017
THOUSAND UNITS DEVELOP.

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:09.386
SO YOU DEVELOP THREE THOUSAND

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.954
ONE TIME KNOW.

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:13.290
IT TAKES A LITTLE TO THE DECADE

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:15.626
TO DECADES TO TO ABSORB ALL THE

00:48:15.692 --> 00:48:17.761
THREE THOUSAND THE FIRST ONE

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:18.629
HUNDRED I GOT THE SUIT.

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:19.596
RATS WITH LIKE I'M JUST TRYING

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:20.697
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMOUNT OF

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:22.299
ACREAGE IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:23.667
WILL HAVE A UNDERSTANDING SO

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:24.668
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TOTAL

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.236
AMOUNT OF ACREAGE FOR THE TH THE

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:27.871
WHOLE BUILD UP TO THREE THOUSAND

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:28.171
OUT MAYBE.

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:29.740
MAYBE I SHOULD EXPLAIN ON THE

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:32.909
MASTER PLAN --

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:36.813
WE HAVE TWO OF THE THREE

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.447
THOUSAND FORUMS ARE BETTER WITH

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:38.882
THEM AT NEW PERCENT SINCE TALK

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:41.518
ABOUT ONE PRODUCT LINE FOR

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:42.719
EIGHTEEN UNITS IT.

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:45.222
FOUND WE HAVE WILL HAVE ANYWHERE

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:48.725
FROM FIVE TO SIX MAYBE EVEN MORE

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:49.192
PRODUCT LINES RUNNING

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:51.595
CONCURRENTLY EVERYTHING FROM YOU

00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:53.997

BROWN. TO GO LARGER AND I

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:58.602
WOULDN'T SAY A LARGE.

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:00.037
A BIT LARGER HOMES IN THERE THAT

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:01.471
MIGHT BE UP TO FIVE THOUSAND

00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:03.073
MAYBE SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.041

IN PLACE YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:17.587
QUESTION --

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:19.823
WE STARTED THIS MASTER PLAN WITH

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.158
ALBERT PARK CENTER BECAUSE WE

00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:23.160

TOGETHER.

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:30.300
AND AND WE GET THE ROADS LAST SO

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:31.635
HOW WOULD LIVE THERE'S ABOUT

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.470
COMMERCIAL INNER SOLAR DAY WE

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:34.604
HAVE MIXED USE.

THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.112
FORWARD.

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:44.548
SO THIS HUNDRED UNITS IS. ONE OF

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:47.851
THE ABOUT TYPES OF PRODUCT LINES

00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:49.453
THAT WOULD EXIST IN HERE.

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.221

BAD NEWS A HUGE HUGE HIT AMOUNT

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:14.211
WAS --

00:50:14.277 --> 00:50:15.212
BECAUSE THE LEVEL FOR YOU GROW

THAT HAVE HAVE FAR COME TO THE

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:20.150
FOR LACK OF FINANCING FOR

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:21.218
SCHOOLS.

00:50:21.284 --> 00:50:22.986
AND BASICALLY THAT'S KEEPING

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:26.022
THIS PROJECT UP ON BLOCKS UNTIL

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.256
SOMEONE.

00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:28.191
GETS ALL --

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:29.226
THE OTHER --

00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:31.328
ITEMS ARE AND WHAT I WANT TO

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:33.029
TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S

00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:36.066
HAPPENING ON ON AN OVERALL BASIS

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:37.367
A LOT OF THE DEVELOPMENT BUT YOU

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:38.902
SEE VERSUS A HOMEBUILDING THAT

00:50:38.969 --> 00:50:40.670
YOU SEE GOING ON IN THE REGION.

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:43.540
IS ON OLD LOCKS HOLDING WHAT'S

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:44.941
IT WILL PERSONALLY DEVELOPER.

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:49.079
ARE GREAT IT INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:51.648
THIRD ROUND BUYERS FROM ONE

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:54.084
RESPONDED OUT OF BAY TO CREATE

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:56.553
NEW LOTS IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.188
DIFFICULT AND SO SOME OF THE

00:50:58.255 --> 00:50:59.623
NUMBERS THAT YOU SEEN FOR SITE

00:50:59.689 --> 00:51:01.024
IMPROVEMENTS THESE IN PUBLIC

00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:04.361
BECAUSE HAVE ALL BEEN WIPED OFF

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:05.462
THE BOOKS.

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:07.364
ON THE EXISTING --

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:11.101
POWER PROJECTS IN A MOVE FORWARD --

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.103
IN TERMS OF THE VERB PRICING

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.237
AGAIN I DON'T GO THROUGH ALL

00:51:14.304 --> 00:51:15.505
THAT DETAIL ON THIS BUT GOOD NET

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:18.241
CREEK TSONGAS WAS NEGATIVE FIVE

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:19.676
POINT 6%.

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.711
SO WE DON'T HAVE AN AFTER TAX

00:51:21.778 --> 00:51:22.979
NUMBER ON HERE BECAUSE WE

00:51:23.046 --> 00:51:24.047
HAVEN'T CLEARED A HURDLE.

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:26.883
AND I BY WAY OF COMPARISON.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.685
OVER THAT NINETEEN YEARS WE DONT

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:29.219
JUST CAME OUT OF THE GREAT

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.620

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:31.621
AND I CAN TELL YOU IN THE MIDDLE

00:51:31.688 --> 00:51:32.889
OF THE GREAT RECESSION SHOULD WE

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:34.691
CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD WITH

00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:36.293
THIS PROJECT WILL IT TAKE SO

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:37.360
LONG.

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.529
THAT YOU CAN NEVER STOPAND

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.097
WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:42.332
CYCLES SO WERE.

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:44.167
WORKING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:45.769
THINGS WILL IMPROVE AND THAT

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.671
WILL WORK HARDER AND WORK ON OUR

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:49.339
SITE BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA ALWAYS

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:50.740
OTHER THINGS.

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:53.076
PRICING ARE WILL YEARS MOOD THE

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:53.677
LIMITING FACTOR ON YOUR THE

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:55.345
FORMER NINETY FOUR THOUSAND

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:56.813
DOLLARS TO YOU SEE OVER THERE.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:57.914
ARE FELIZ.

00:51:57.981 --> 00:51:59.883
IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONE

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.284
POINT TWO MILLION THAT HAVE THEM

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:03.954
AND WOULD BE WORKFORCE FRIENDLY.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.622
BUT WE CAN'T DELIVER IT WITH ALL

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.591
THE COSTS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:08.425
US TODAY SO.

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:10.961
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT FOUR

00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:11.461
NINETY FOUR THOUSAND IS

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:12.729
BASICALLY THE PRE RECESSION

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:14.664
PRICING THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE

00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:16.233
CYCLE SACRAMENTO REGION.

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:19.069
UNFORTUNATELY THE FEES A SLIGHT

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:21.438
IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE LABOR COSTS

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:22.472
ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:24.808
EVERYTHING ELSE HAS GONE UP IT

00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:26.343
IS NOT STOP INCREASING SO THE

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:26.710
GAP [inaudible]

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:29.913
CLOSE SO.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.414
THIS PROJECT MY JOHN.

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:34.618
IS TO GET READY. TO DEPLOY.

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:35.752
WHEN THE DYNAMICS ARE THERE

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:39.089
EITHER REDUCING COSTS OR

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:39.389
[inaudible]

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:41.591
PRICE INCREASES BUT WE'LL TALK

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:42.158
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DEPLOY

00:52:42.225 --> 00:52:44.127
LISTEN MARKET DEUCES IN SUSPENSE

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:49.332
UNTIL WE GET.

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.134

CONSTRUCTION AS YOU CAN SEE.

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:05.942
IN THE TRI VALLEY --

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:08.878
THIS THE PROJECT IS SHE HOMES.

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:10.814
HAS BUILT WE'VE HAD IT FOR MANY

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.716
YEARS IN THE FAMILY THIS IS THE

00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:14.084
PICTURE OF THE BEAUTIFUL REC

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.052
CENTER THAT WE BUILT --

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.854
THE FABLESS COMMUNITY IS FOUR

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:21.324
HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR UNITS --

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.859
AND IT IS ALL [inaudible]

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:26.229
TOWN HOMES --

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:27.597
FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT TYPES OF

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.032
THE GET IN TOTAL AT SEVENTEEN

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:30.800
DIFFERENT FLOOR PLANS ALL

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:32.369
RANGING FROM.

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.870
TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY SQUARE FEET

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:34.437
TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.973
SQUARE FEET --

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.575
IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:40.243
PROJECT FOR US --

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.811
TO GET TO THIS POINT TOOK MANY

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.580
YEARS OF THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:44.481
ACTION THIS IS IN THE CITY A

00:54:44.547 --> 00:54:45.882
LIVER MORE.

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:47.384
NOW THIS IS JUST THE SITE PLAN

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.852
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE REC CENTER

00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:50.820
LIES IN THE LEFT HAND SIDE --

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:52.188
TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF THE

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:53.657
DYNAMICS --

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:55.291
BEFORE I GO THROUGH THE PRO FORM --

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:57.027
THIS PROJECT.

00:54:57.093 --> 00:54:58.762
WHERE WE ACTUALLY OWN THE LAND

00:54:58.828 --> 00:54:59.929
SO THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.965
TAKING IT FROM?

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:03.933
PLANNING THROUGH DEALING WITH

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.369
ALL OF THE CITY DYNAMICS GOING

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:08.171
THROUGH REGULATORY.

00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:09.372
CONCERNS DOING ALL THE LAND

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:10.874
DEVELOPMENT ULTIMATELY BILL IN

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.742
THE HOMES AND I HAVE ABOUT A

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.245
HUNDRED UNITS LEFT TO BUILD --

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:18.314
THIS PROJECT HAD A COUPLE MAJOR

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.649
HURDLES THAT ALL THIS USES SOME

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:20.884
EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.352
CHALLENGES WE WORK THROUGH.

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:23.353
CITY LIVERMORE WHEN YOU'RE

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.888
DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY HAS WITH

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:26.489
THE BECAUSE SCENIC CORPS OR IT'S

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:28.324
A VIEW CORRIDOR THEY EXPECT TO

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:29.859
BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN YOUR ON THE

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:32.328
FREEWAY ON A ON AN ANGLE.

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:33.963
THE HILLS BEHIND WHAT WOULD BE

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.532
POTENTIALLY THE HOMES.

00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:37.233
THE DENSITY THAT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.002
PRESCRIBED FOR THE PROPERTY WAS

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:41.037
IN CONFLICT WITH THE VIEW

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.605
QUARTERS IF YOU WERE A BILL THAT

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:43.673
THAT DENSITY.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.141
WHICH WAS TWENTY FOUR UNITS THE

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:46.776
ACRE THE HEIGHT OF THOSE

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.211
BUILDINGS WOULD PIERCE THROUGH

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.379
THE THIS.

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:51.581
VIEW QUORUM AND SO THE IDEA WAS

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:54.484
GOING TO BE DIG A HOLE.

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:56.152
AND BURY THE UNITS INTO THE HOLE

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:58.154
WHAT OUT HOLE WAS AT EIGHT

00:55:58.221 --> 00:55:58.788
HUNDRED THOUSAND YARD HOLE IN

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.023
ALL THE DEVELOPMENT WHO HAD BEEN

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.257
DONE IN THE SURROUNDING AREA

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:02.559
WHICH MEANT THAT.

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.527
I WOULD HAVE TO EXPORT THAT DIRT

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:06.262
DOWN ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES DOWN

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:07.197
THE FREEWAY.

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.164
AND IT WAS APPROXIMATE TWENTY

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:12.202
DOLLARS A YEAR YOU DO EIGHT

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:12.769
HUNDRED THOUSAND YARDS TIMES

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:13.903
TWENTY DOLLARS THE ARE THAT

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.138
SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.439
JUST ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE THIS

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.241
PROJECT NOT WORK.

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.743
ALONG WITH THAT WE HAD

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:21.811
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IT THIS

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.413
WAS BE ENTITLED DURING THE

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.248
DOWNTURN HAD IT OF THE PMR

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:27.851
REQUIREMENT A 15% WAS MEANT.

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:28.852
SEVEN LITTLE OVER SEVENTY UNITS

00:56:28.918 --> 00:56:30.687
WERE NOT TO BE SOLD AT THREE

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:31.321
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND AS

00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:33.089
YOU CAN SEE WERE SOLELY SO THAT

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:33.857
EIGHT ARE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:35.391
SO TAKE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:36.092
DOLLAR SUBSIDY TIMES OVER

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:37.894
SEVENTY UNITS.

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:39.195
YOU CAN SEE THAT'S ANOTHER

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:39.729
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.297
PAINFUL --

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:42.966
ISSUE FOR THE PROJECT I WAS

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:44.300
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WORK WITH

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:46.069
THE CITY AND I FEED OUT WHICH

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:48.071
MEAN I PAID THEM A NICE BIG.

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.440
VERY LARGE CHECK WOULD NOT

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:51.274
THIRTY FIVE MILLION OR TO FEE

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:52.275
OUT OF THE PROJECT COULD MOVE

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:54.077
FORWARD.

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:54.778
AS WERE ABOUT TO START THE

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:57.480
PROJECT IN IF I GO BACK TO TIME

00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:58.882
WHEN WE WERE READY TO BREAK

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.316
CONSTRUCTION.

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:01.951
CALIFORNIA FISH WILDLIFE CAME

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:03.653
ALONG AND TOLD ME THAT THIS.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.755
PROPERTY WAS POTENTIAL HAVE A

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.891
DOUBT FOR THE RED LEGGED FROG.

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:09.659
MAKES GIVEN THE TIGER SALAMANDER.

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:10.627
DECEMBER SPECIES --

00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:12.362
THE TIGER SALAMANDER EVEN THOUGH

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:13.963
THERE HAVE BEEN COUPLE MILES

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.632
AWAY WOULD BE THE ONLY SIDE WE

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:17.534
SEEN ATTIRE SALAMANDER BUT IT

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.435
HAD HAVE ATTACK CHARACTERISTICS

00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:21.371
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY.

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:22.906
BE HABITAT FOR THE TIGER

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:24.307
SALAMANDER.

00:57:24.374 --> 00:57:26.709
A YEAR AND A HALF LATER --

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:27.777
WORKING WITH CALIFORNIA FISH

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:31.014
WILDLIFE AS I WENT TO A PROPERTY

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.382
OWNER ABOUT A MILE HALF AWAY HE

00:57:32.448 --> 00:57:33.650
TRULY HAD.

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.618
TRUE CHARACTERISTICS. FOR A

00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:37.487
TIGER SALAMANDER AND PUTTING

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:39.656
DOWN MEN'S AND USE THAT PROPERTY

00:57:39.722 --> 00:57:42.158
FOR MITIGATION WHICH WAS FIVE

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:42.859
MILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN THE

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:44.160
ENDOWMENTS AND AND SECURING THE

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:45.461
PROPERTY.

00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:46.729
SO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:48.865
COSTS IN A DELAY OF THE YEAR AND

00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:50.733
A HALF I THINKING TO MARKET.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.702
IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT DELAY.

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.437
THE HOMES WERE VALUED AT THE

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:57.807
TIME PRIOR TO THAT CHALLENGE AT

00:57:57.874 --> 00:57:58.408
SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SIX

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:00.476
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A UNIT.

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:01.711
SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:02.979
WHERE YOU LOOKING GO WILL YOU DO

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:04.581
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE DOING OKAY

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:05.481
AND WE ARE.

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:06.783
WE'RE DOING OKAY BECAUSE PRICES

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.518
WENT UP BY A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:09.085
THOUSAND DOLLARS DURING THE

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:10.520
DELAYS THAT I HAD.

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:12.388
WHICH ABSORB THE EXTRA FIVE

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:14.123
MILLION DOLLARS IN COST BUT WHO

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:14.858
LOSES IN THAT EXAMPLE

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:15.158
[inaudible]

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:16.993
THE CONSUMER.

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.761
IT OF THIS IS IT THIS RIGHT HERE

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:19.796
IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOU LOOK

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:20.630
AT THE WHOLE TRI VALLEY

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:22.398
CURRENTLY FOR NEW HOMES THIS IS

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:24.000
MOST AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:26.135
BETWEEN THE CITIES OF PLEASANTON

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:28.037
LIVERMORE DUBLIN AND SAN RAMON

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:29.372
IS THE MOST AFFORDABLE PROJECT

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:31.474
I'M AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:31.875
DOLLARS IN THESE.

00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:33.409
ARE ATTACHED PRODUCTS.

00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:35.378
YES DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOWNTURN.

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:36.646
THAT HOUSE PRICES WERE ALREADY

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:37.847
ON THE THREE AND A FIFTY

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:38.448
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE SAME

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:39.549
UNIT.

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:40.884
AND SO THIS IS KIND OF THE VERY

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.385
ABILITY YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:43.152
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.621
MARKETPLACE.

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:45.922
AND AND WHEN YOU CONSTRAINTS

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:47.457
SUPPLY AND YOU HAVE THE JOB

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.058
GROWTH THAT WE HAVE SO WE ALL

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:49.893
WANT TO CELEBRATE THAT WE'RE

00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:51.427
HAVING THIS GREAT ECONOMY IN THE

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:52.462
BAY AREA.

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:53.630
BUT YOU'VE GOT A BALANCE A

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:55.265
SUPPLY OF HOUSING WITH THE

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:56.299
DEMAND.

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.533
AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT EVEN

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.369
CLOSE BECAUSE OF I GET A HAIR

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:01.304
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TOWN HOME --

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:02.705
IN THAT'S THE MOST AFFORDABLE

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:05.341
PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE.

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:07.410
SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE YOU KNOW

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:09.679
IT SUCCESSFUL FOR OUR COMPANY.

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:11.080
BUT IT I DON'T LOOK IT IS BEING

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:12.749
SUCCESSFUL FOR THE COMMUNITY

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:13.783
JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:15.051
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:17.186
YOUNG PEOPLE MOST OF MOST OF THE

00:59:17.253 --> 00:59:18.788
PEOPLE THAT ARE BUYING.

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.957
IN THIS DEVELOPMENT ARE OUNG

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:22.926
JUST NEWLY STARTING OUT FAMILIES

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:24.727
THE NUMBER OF YOUNG KIDS.

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:26.195
USING THAT REC CENTER I MEAN

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:28.031
IT'S IT'S WONDERFUL BUT IT IS I

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:29.065
KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALL STRETCHING

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:30.133
THEMSELVES TO LIMIT BILL FOR

OKAY THAT'S THE SWINGING

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.243
VARIATION IN THE WHAT IT WOULD

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.311
HAVE BEEN IN THE RECESSION AND

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.913
TO WHAT IT.

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.347
IS NOW AND WHAT IT WOULD HAVE

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:00.450
BEEN HAD THE FEDERAL DELAY NOT

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.118
HAPPEN RIGHT.

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:02.752
SO THAT THE STATE DELAY WAS THE

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:05.088
SITE.

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:07.123
YEAH SORRY LEFT [inaudible]

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:10.560
AND THEN.

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:11.027
IT.

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:11.928
IT WAS IT WAS LIKE WHEN YOU

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:13.396
REALIZE YOU ARE PART OF THE

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:14.797
PROBLEM YEAH --

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:16.232
BUT A ITS BITS SPEAKS THE THE

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:17.800
EXTREME VOLATILITY MEG AGAIN

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:18.634
AGAINST MY CONSTITUENT

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:19.836
PROSPECTIVELY PEOPLE FIND IT

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:20.803
DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THE

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.071
VARIATION CAN BE.

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.573
THAT WIDE IT FEELS ANECDOTAL BUT

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.208
IT'S HELPFUL TO SEE IT ON A PAGE

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:26.142
TO KIND OF PAPER PICTURE WILL

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:27.743
SALUTE YOU'RE DEALING WITH --

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.378
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGE

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.481
RIGHT AND HOW WE CAN ALL WORK

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:33.049
CLEVERLY TO MAKE IT SO.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.183
HOME OTHERWISE WANT ONE POINT ON

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.784
THAT IS REAL QUICK IS I THINK

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.052
PART.

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.553
HOW WE LOOK AT OUR BUSINESS AND

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.422
THE RETURNS THAT WE EXPECT LIKE

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.190
ANY INVESTMENT?

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:42.992
THE MORE RISK WITHIN.

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.393
THE HIGHER RETURNS ARE LOOKING

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.695
FOR AND GIVEN THAT IT'S SO

01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:47.463
UNPREDICTABLE OUR BUSINESS.

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:50.399
THAT I THINK THAT WE WE HAD THIS

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:51.434
PERCEPTION THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.035
FOR HIGH RETURNS IT'S BECAUSE

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.104
THE AMOUNT OF TIMES WE LOSE.

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:55.838
WHEN YOU HAVE A SUCCESSFUL

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.106
PROJECT WITH THIS ONE WAS YOU

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:58.307
HAVE TO KIND OF MAKE UP FOR ALL

01:02:58.374 --> 01:02:59.842
THE PROJECTS THAT YOU NEVER GOT

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:00.710
DONE YEAH?

01:03:00.776 --> 01:03:02.578
AND IN THAT JUST BECOMES BECAUSE

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:05.615
IT'S A RISK REWARD A SITUATION.

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.550
I SOME MEMBER FRIEDMAN.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.719

YOU'VE HEARD FROM BUILDERS WHO

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:02.164
SUCCESSFULLY BUILT IN CALIFORNIA

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:02.798
AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:03.899
FACE.

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.701
AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE THE

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.169
STATE DOES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:08.738
THIS OBVIOUSLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:10.306
TO TURN THE FEES AS PLAIN JUST

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.407
OUTLINED FOR YOU.

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:12.375
ON EACH OF THOSE DECISIONS ON

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.509
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN IMPACT

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.111
THE COST.

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:16.145
BUT THE STATE DOES PLAY A ROLE

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:17.413
IN THIS AND SO COUPLE THINGS WE

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.514
JUST WANNA BRING TO YOUR

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.448
ATTENTION AND I KNOW WHERE AT

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:21.284
THE END OF BOTH HIS HEARING AND

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.985
ALSO THE END OF THIS SESSION.

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:24.754
BUT AS YOU PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR --

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.355
BOTH GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES OF

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.823
EXPRESSES OUR TO BUILD AS MUCH

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.692
AS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSING

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.661
UNITS IN CALIFORNIA PER YEAR.

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:32.628
LAST YEAR WE PULLED ABOUT A

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:34.964
HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PER THE

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.465
LEGEND WAS OFFICE IN THE HOUSING

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:37.767
COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT OF CPO

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:39.535
SAID INDEPENDENT OF US.

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:40.870
THAT THE CURRENT NEED OF HOUSING

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:42.371
IS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.073
UNITS A YEAR JUST TO KEEP UP

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.708
WITH POPULATION GROWTH.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.009
IT'S WERE BUILDING BUT HUNDRED

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:48.711
TEND UNDER FIFTEEN THOUSAND SO

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:49.812
EACH YEAR THE SUPPLIES

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:51.213
DIMINISHING THE DEMAND IS

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.282
INCREASING AS YOU SEE THE COST

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:54.950
IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF.

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:56.886
SO PART OF THIS IS ADDING SUPPLY.

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:58.120
AND WHERE THE STATE CAN HELP IN

01:05:58.187 --> 01:05:59.955
THAT A COUPLE THINGS SEEK WAS A

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.757
HOLY GRAIL FOR ENVIRONMENTS WE

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:02.825
RESPECT THAT BUT THERE ARE WAYS

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:03.959
TO EXPEDITE.

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:05.828
THE SUPER PROCESS WE USE IT FOR

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.330
LARGE STADIUMS AND OTHER MAJOR

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:08.798
EVENTS MIGHT WE CONSIDER FOR

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.833
HOUSING.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.934
STATE WATER BOARD THIS MANY

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.036
TIMES WE HAVE TO GET WATER KNOW

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.838
OUR WATER PROCESS SUPPOSED TO

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.239
STATE LAW BUT THEIR WASTE YOU

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:19.442
THAT MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY.

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:20.976
AND MORE AFFORDABLY.

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:22.378
WE TOUCHED ON DEVELOPER FEES

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:25.715
THERE REALLY IS NO NEXUS --

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:27.416
BUT EVERY TIME A BUILDER SAYS I

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:28.784
DON'T LIKE YOUR NEXUS AGO WILL

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:30.619
GET BACK TO YOU.

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:31.954
WILL GET BACK TO YOU AND TIME

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.889
DELAY IS YOUR ENEMY IS A BUILDER

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.791
SO THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS TO

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:36.425
FOR SOMEONE TO BRING CLARITY TO

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:37.960
THAT.

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.595
IT'S JUST ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.297
MITIGATION OFFSETS JOHN TOUCHED

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:42.198
ON THIS --

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:43.833
OBIT BUT IF YOU HAVE A FIVE

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.101
HUNDRED ACRE PARCEL AND YOU HAVE

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.135
TO COME UP WITH SIX HUNDRED

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:48.003
ACRES SOMEWHERE ELSE TO OFFSET

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.338
THE MITIGATION.

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:50.773
THAT JUST ADDS CRIMES SO OF

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.675
THEIR WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT WE

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:53.909
CAN STILL BILL BEAUTIFUL PARKS.

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.611
BUT WE NEED YOU KNOW SIX HUNDRED

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:56.345
ACRES OF OFFSETS.

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.814
CODE MANDATES WHETHER IT'S SOLAR

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.883
WHETHER IT SEISMIC AND WE DO

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:01.817
HAVE THE MOST.

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.686
ENERGY EFFICIENT SEISMICALLY

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.955
SAFE HOMES ALREADY IN THE UNITED

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:08.090
STATES IN CALIFORNIA SO THIS

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.525
FACTOR THAT IN WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.127
THOSE POLICY DECISIONS THEY DO

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.028
IMPACT THE BOTTOM LINE --

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:14.663
AND ALSO JUST DUMB THINGS WITHIN

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:15.865
A ARE BE IN VEHICLE MILES

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:17.233
TRAVELED THESE ARE THINGS THAT

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:19.068
COST -- IN

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.369
THE LAST SCENE WE TOUCHED ON WAS

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:21.303
SCHOOLS SO THAT THE STATE OF

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.471
CALIFORNIA.

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.973
HAS APPROVED NINE BILLION

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.207
DOLLARS IN BONDS WITH ONLY

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.208
ALLOCATED SIX HUNDRED FORTY

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:27.543
MILLION.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.546
SO THE MORE YOU ALLOCATE SCHOOL

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.982
MONIES THE LESS IT COSTS FOR

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:34.617
DEVELOPER FEES AND MOST

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.018
IMPORTANTLY THE MORE OUR SCHOOLS

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.219
ARE BUILT REFURBISHED.

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:38.287
SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT THE

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:39.555
STATE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THESE

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:41.957
ISSUES AND MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:42.825

AS MENTIONED BEFORE THIS IS AN

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:47.830
ONGOING DIALOGUE WORDS THIS

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.231
ISN'T ONE AND DONE WE'D LIKE TO

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:50.866
CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE.

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:51.967
AND WE'RE JUST PART OF IT

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.702
THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER COMMUNITY

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.738
THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING.

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.006
BUT AS THE HOME BUILDERS

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.174
NOW WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.975
WE CAN BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.343
WHEN TO DO THAT GOING FORWARD SO

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.678
MISTER CHAIRMAN.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:03.379
CAN THAT CONCLUDES OUR

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:04.780
PRESENTATION TO YOU WE DO AGAIN

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:08.584
INSIGHTS AND KNOWLEDGE REGARDING

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.119
HOMEBUILDING.

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:11.487
THANK YOU DAN UP I WANT TO GIVE

QUESTIONS BEFORE WE WRAP UP --

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:17.927
OR MAKING IT A COMMENTS AS WELL --

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.295
IF THEY'RE NOT HOW DISSIMILAR

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:20.496
THINK THE MEMBERS OF THE

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:21.130
COMMITTEE WHO SHOWED UP TODAY

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:23.165

MISS OUT YOU ARE CURRY --

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:27.169
I THINK IT SHOWS --

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:28.971
THAT THERE IS A HUGE APPETITE IN

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:30.473
THE LEGISLATURE TO TACKLE ISSUES

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.141
OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:34.510
PARTICULARLY FOR THIS THIS METAL --

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:35.144
THAT I THINK IS OF A CONCERN I'M

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.746
SURE ALL OF US SITUATES WHETHER

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:39.815

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:41.317
SO COASTAL OR INLAND ALL OF US

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:42.518
ARE DOING WITH IT RIGHT.

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:43.352
ON I THINK TODAY'S PRE

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:45.721
CONVERSATION HELPS TO DEMYSTIFY

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.223
I'M SOME OF WHAT IT IS THAT

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:48.157
