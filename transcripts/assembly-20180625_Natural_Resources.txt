TO CALL THIS MEETING TO ORDER. THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WE ARE PROCEEDING BY SIGN IN ORDER. I SEE CENTER WHITE CAO SKI HERE ALTHOUGH SEVERAL LEYVA HAD SIGNED IN FIRST I DON'T SEE HER. GOING ONCE GOING TWICE. ALRIGHT CENTER WIECKOWSKI WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON'T -- TWO SP. ONE SIX EIGHT TOM I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR EXCELLENT WORK ON THIS BILL I WILL START BY ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS REQUEST IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH WILL ALLOW CALORIE CYCLE. TO JUST THE MINIMUM MINIMUM CONTENT STANDARDS DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND SUPPLY IT WOULD SHIFT THE FOCUS OF THE CAL RECCLE STUDY FROM THAT FUHRMAN EP OUR PROGRAM TO LOOKING AT OTHER BOTTLE BILL PROGRAMS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. I THINK SUCH A REPORT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND A WHAT OTHER STATES SUCH AS OREGON ARE DOING AND WHAT IS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT IS NOT PROVEN SUCCESSFUL. I THINK THESE AMENDMENTS WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE BILL AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATIONS. NOW S. B. ONE SIX EIGHT MAY HAVE GONE FROM ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO ACTUALLY ONE OF OF THE MOST SIMPLE LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR HELD A SERIES OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. ARE ON RECYCLING -- THIS RECYCLING PROGRAM THE LA JOH A ISSUED A DETAILED REPORT. CAL RECYCLED ISSUED ITS WHITE PAPER ON THE PROGRAM AND THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE WHICH S. SENATOR STONE SERVICES BY STURE Y. WITH ME HELD A HEARING ON THE PROGRAM. TODAY I'M BEFORE YOU TO ADDRESS TOO SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT COMPONENTS AT THAT CAME OUT OF ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT WERE GOING ON FOR SO MANY YEARS FIRST SP ONE SIXTY EIGHT DIRECTS CAL RECYCLE TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM. CONTENT STANDARDS FOR ALL BEVERAGE CONTAINERS CAL RECYCLE IS BEST SUITED TO DETERMINE THESE NUMBERS FUTURE RAY OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM INCLUDING THEIR OWN SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE AND THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS. AS A KNOWLEDGEABLE IS WE ARE HERE IN THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY I I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF US HAS THE EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO KNOW. OF WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE PERCENTAGE -- WHAT THE APPROPRIATE PERCENT SHOULD BE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT GIVEN CAL RECYCLE% AUTHORITY TO SET THE MINIMUM CONTENT STANDARDS? DOES NOT EQUATE TO UNFETTERED LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY -- AS SOME MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED IF CAL RECYCLE FAILS TO SET STANDARDS TO HELP FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AND THE BRICK AND THE RECYCLING GOALS OF THE BOTTLE BILL WORK CAL RECYCLE DOES NOT SET THE STANDARDS. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE FLUCTUATING MARKET CONDITIONS AS THIS COMMITTEE HAS SO THOUGHTFULLY INCLUDED A AS A PARAMETER THERE IS NOTHING THAT PREVENTS THE LEGISLATURE FROM GOING IN AND SITTING THOSE MEN IN CONTEXT STANDARDS WE HAVE THOSE. THAT ABILITY NOW AND WE CAN ACCESSIBILITY ACT IN THE FUTURE WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING IS WHAT THE EXPERTS HAVE THE FIRST CRACK AT THIS. ITEM AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT SHOULD BE DOING IT ADDITIONALLY THE MINERAL CONTENT STANDARDS WILL PRODUCE BOTH ECONOMIC. AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS CREATING MARKETS FOR RECYCLES MATERIA MATERIAL RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE OVERSEAS MARKET PARTICULARLY CHINA AS A OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. ARM ARE NOW CLOSE TO MANY OF OUR RECYCLED MATERIALS IT GENERAL GENERATED FIRE MENTAL BENEFITS BY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES AS ONE OF OUR WITNESSES WILL POINT OUT. A IN A INCREASE IN THE USE OF RECYCLED COTTON PLASTIC GARB BOTTLES BY 23% CAN REDUCE OF THE RESULT IN GREENHOUSE GASES BY I'M I HAVE MY CO AUTHOR A SIMILAR STONE'S HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADD. THAT SAY A FEW WORDS BEFORE WE BRING HONOR THAT EXPERT TESTIMONY ZEPA SHOP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE HONORABLE LA COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH SENATOR WIECKOWSKI AND MYSELF -- IN PROMOTING THIS -- GOOD LEADS REQUIRE SOME -- RECYCLED UP PLASTICS GOING BACK INTO OUR RECYCLING PROGRAM TO HELP -- CAO RECYCLE USE THEIR EXPERTISE AND AND HAVE A PROGRAM THAT ULTIMATELY IS SUCCESSFUL REDUCING PLASTICS ARE GOING TO LANDFILL IN. AND REVIVE -- CAO RECYCLING PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO BRING IN THE RECYCLABLES -- AS WE KNOW CHINA IS KINDA CLOSE THE DOOR YOU OFFER RECYCLE PLASTICS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE DUMPING A LOT OF VIRGIN PLASTICS ON OUR MARKET WHICH IS TOTALLY DISRUPTED OUR SYSTEM THIS IS GOING TO BE A FIX IT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE. A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT POSITIVE FOR A LOCAL STORES HAVE TO DEAL WITH NO CENTERS FOR PEOPLE. TO BRING THEIR THE RECYCLABLES AND I FIRMLY STAND WITH THE FOR THE CHAIRMAN AND DRIVE OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE WE PROCEED ANY FURTHER I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR ROLL CALL THE STATUS QUO. MEMBERS MURATSUCHI HERE THREATS ISSUE HERE ACOSTA [inaudible] CHAU. CHAU HERE EGGMAN [inaudible] NO [inaudible] EGGMAN HERE [inaudible] FLORA. LOW MOAN MCCARTY MELENDEZ WINDOWS SERIOUS. RISKIER STONE THEIR STONE HERE. ALRIGHT WE HAVE QUORUM THEM PROCEDURALLY -- FOR TODAY AS ALWAYS WE WILL -- ALLOW UP TO THREE WITNESSES ON EACH SIDE -- SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION A LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES EACH [inaudible] WELCOME. HOPE THEY'LL BE MUCH SHORT OF NOT MISTER CHAIR I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM FIRST OF ALL WE'D LIKE TO ADD TO SIT SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR IN THAT CO AUTHOR. APOLLO TREAT REPRESENTING CPR SEE IT'S THE CALIFORNIA PLASTICS RECYCLERS COALITION. IT'S MADE UP OF FIVE OF THE LARGEST OUR P. ET PLASTIC RECYCLERS PROCESSORS IN RECLAIMER IS IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE FACILITIES AND SPEAKER RENDON SAYS STREAK WE HAVE FACILITIES AND SUSAN EGGMAN STEPSISTER DISTRICT IN QUITE A FEW OTHERS -- THESE COMPANIES TAKE PLASTIC BOTTLE CONTAIN AND CONTAINERS THEY MAKE THEM INTO NEW RECYCLED P. ET MATERIAL CALLED OUR P. ET. THEY IN FACT ARE THE ONES WHO CLOSE THE LOOP ON PLASTIC RECYCLING WITH ME TODAY IS ALEX DALEK PRESIDENCY OVER DECAL RECYCLING HE'S OUT OF SPEAKER RENDON SISTER [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ON ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ALEX DELICATE NOW COMPANY PROJECT RECYCLING AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA PLASTICS RECYCLED COALITION. HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS INTO CALIFORNIA RECYCLING ECONOMY AND CREATE IT OVERSIGHT WASN'T GREEN JOBS. WE HAVE HAD THE TECHNICAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE FDA APPROVED FOOD GRADE RECYCLED PLASTIC FOR MANY YEARS. BUT IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE MANAGED TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCT IN YOU CAN FIND BEVERAGE CONTAINERS MADE. FROM UP TO A 100% OF THE RECYCLE BT ON THE SHELL OF CALIFORNIA STORES. ACOSTA FOR EXAMPLE THESE PLASTIC BOTTLES CONTAINING RECYCLED PT OUR PATH CAN VERY PROCESS BACK INTO BEVERAGE CONTAINERS MANY TIME OVER AND THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF WASTE AND CARBON FOOTPRINT. OF PLASTIC PACKAGING HOWEVER OUR INDUSTRIES AND CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST SEVEN EIGHT YEARS. OUR PRODUCT RECYCLE PEACHY AS MENTIONED BY SENATOR STONE CONSIDERED BY BRAIN OWNERS AND BEVERAGE CONTAINER MANUFACTURERS TO BE A COMMODITY. AND WE HAVE TO COMPETE ON PRICE WITH THE HYPE HYDROCARBON BASED VIRGIN PT INDUSTRY. NO SUSTAINABLE PLASTIC RECYCLING INDUSTRY CAN BE BUILT WITHOUT SUSTAINABLE DEMAND INVERSION PT IS USUALLY MUCH CHEAPER TO BUY. CALIFORNIA DOESN'T EITHER REQUEST RECYCLING INDUSTRY THAT WOULD UTILIZE SUPPLY GENERATED. WITHIN THE STATE IN WOULD MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS USED IN THE STATE WAS OUT REGULATORY SUPPORT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF CALIFORNIA PLASTICS RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HIGHLY VALUED GREEN MANUFACTURING JOBS WILL DISAPPEAR THAT WILL BRING DOWN PLASTIC COLLECTION RATES. INCREASE IT UNCONTROLLED FLOW OF PLASTICS WASTE OF WHICH WE KNOW IS SIGNIFICANT PART WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME OCEAN PLUS SIX OR GO TO THE LANDFILL. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PLASTICS RECYCLING COALITION ARE YOU I NEED THE I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE -- CALIFORNIA HAS HAD MANDATORY MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT FOR NON FOOD CONTACT PLASTIC CONTAINERS IN PLACE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE'VE HAD MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT FOR GLASS CONTAINERS ALL GLASS CONTAINERS WE'VE HAD MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT FOR NEWSPRINT EVERY NEWSPRINT CALIFORNIA HAS RECYCLED HOT CONTENT BECAUSE WE MANDATED. IN NEWSPAPERS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. AND SO THIS ISN'T A NEW IDEA CAL CAL RECYCLE HAS RECENTLY REPORTED ON THE SPECTRUM OF RECYCLED CONTENT THAT'S BEING USED BY BEVERAGE PLASTIC BEVERAGE PRODUCERS TODAY. AND AS ALEX NOTED WE HAVE THE SPECTRUM FROM 1100% RECYCLED CONTENT IN SOME BOTTLES. TWO ZERO RECYCLE CONTENT ON AVERAGE. THERE'S ABOUT 13%. OF THE MATERIAL THAT WERE COLLECTING FOR RECYCLING -- PLASTIC THAT WERE COLLECTED RECYCLING THAT'S GOING BACK INTO THESE BOTTLES. WE HAVE A 75% COLLECTION RATE THAT'S THE GAP WERE TRYING TO SHRINK BACK GAP WERE TRYING TO USE THIS MARKET BASED APPROACH WHICH WE'VE ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY DONE WITH OTHER MATERIALS. PORT THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. CLEAR THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE THOSE CHINESE AND USE MARKETS FOR RECYCLE PLASTIC FOR THE PLASTIC THAT WE COLLECT RECYCLING. THIS IS OUR WAY OF CONTROLLING OUR OWN DESTINY CREATING MARKETS REDUCING THE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT ARM UP THE PLASTIC BY USING. RECYCLED MATERIAL IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THE NEW PLASTIC BUTTER DRIVE OUT. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE SIR. STATE YOUR NAME AND POSITION ONLY THANK YOU. THERESA BROKERAGE ON BEHALF OF YOUR THE BAY IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY AND SUPPORT. REPLANT ALSO IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL LYNCH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORES IN SUPPORT.

MELISSA AND MO WITH CHAU YOUR ENTRY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL THE SOLID WASTE ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA AND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO ON SPORT. JUNE IRVINE ON BEHALF OF WASTE MANAGEMENT WE NEED THE MARKETS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE SUPPORT THE BILL. GEN A PRICE FOR CALIFORNIA LEAD CONSERVATION INTEREST SUPPORT. CHUCKLED REPUBLIC SERVICES AND SUPPORT. ARAB POTASH TERATOLOGY IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR I THINK -- THINK GEE NERVOUS TESTIMONY WAS FOR PEOPLE. ESTA CRIME MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF THE GLASS TAXIS. TO EARLIER AGAIN M. IT'S AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS BY COMMITTEE CONSULTANT BY THE WAY AND AND POINT OUT. WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE BILL BEFORE IT WAS AMENDED? AMENDMENT AND I THINK I'M -- THAT THE AUTHOR IN AND IN THE SUPPORTERS I'M IN. KINDA MAKES MY CASE THE FOR GLASS CONTAINERS BEING EXEMPTED OUT OF THE BILL AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALL THE TESTIMONY ON THE BILL'S ABOUT CREATING MARKETS FOR PLASTIC CAN AND THAT'S FINE IF THAT'S WHAT. YOU WANNA DO. CLASS HOW THE MARKET THERE'S A COMMODITY FOR RECYCLE GLASS. AND GLASS CONTAINERS ON YOUR HEATER MANUFACTURERS WANT AS MUCH -- RECYCLE GLASSES THAT POSSIBLY GIG THEY THAT THEIR INCENTIVE IT'S THERE. I'M LOWER FURNACE TEMPERATURES SAVE THEM MONEY STATE IN ENERGY COSTS LOWER THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. STATE CALIFORNIA HOUSE THAT NEED IT ON IN STATE CALIFORNIA CLASS PLANTS -- BUT NOT ALL GO HOME ANOTHER GLASS PLATES AROUND THE WORLD ARE IN EVEN ON THE PART OF THE COUNTRY -- HAVE A BOTTLE BILL THAT SUPPORTS AB A RECYCLE RECYCLED CONTENT A TIME YOU KNOW WRITTEN AND EIGHT AND AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL THIS BILL WOULD -- AFFECT FILLED AN UNFILLED CONTAINERS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA MATTER WHERE THEY'RE MADE AND WHAT HOUSE CURRY CYCLE MIGHT HAVE SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE TO DO THIS -- THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE NEEDED A GLASS BOTTLE IS 1100% RECYCLED WHAT WHAT THEY NEED IS EXPERTISE TO KNOW THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN. THE COMMODITY MARKETS IN THOSE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD IN COUNTRY. IF IF THERE'S THERE'S NO RECYCLING SYSTEM NEARBY THERE'S NOT GONNA A BOTTLE MANUFACTURER IS GOING TO STRUGGLE TO MAKE A A RECYCLED CONTENT BILL A BOTTLE. SO ON WE JUST ASK YOU KNOW IF IF IF THIS BILL IS ABOUT. I'M CREATING A MARKET FOR PLASTIC DIDN'T LOOK I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FOR THAT THANKS. MY NAME'S THEM CUTTING MORE THEM AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE THE PARCC THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL APPEARS TO BE TO STIMULATE THE MARKET -- AT THE GREATEST IMPACT BECAUSE THE LARGEST UP CRV CONTAINERS IS THE P. T. BOTTLE -- AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THERE IS NO MARKET PROBLEM FOR PT BOTTLES -- I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS A SET OF PRC SEE WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED THIRTY YEARS AGO. AS A NUMBER OF PROFIT PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY ORGANIZATION. COMMITTING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT REDUCING SOLID WASTE THROUGH THE RECYCLING OF PT CONTAINERS. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE TO INCREASE THE PUBLIC AWARENESS -- AND THE RECYCLING RATES FOR PT BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND TO ENSURE STABLE AND USE MARKETS FOR ALL THE PT COLLECTING CALIFORNIA. COME ALSO TO IN SCRIPT INCREASE THE SCRAP VALUE PT AND TO REDUCE THE COSTS OF COLLECTION AND ALSO TO TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE SYSTEM -- WHEAT PURCHASE OVER 40% OF THE SCRAPPY T. BILLS THAT ARE GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA. A WE KNOW THERE IS NO MARKET PROBLEMS WITH P. T. SCRIPT BECAUSE WE LIVE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY. THAT'S A LOT OF MATERIAL THAT WE HANDLE -- BECAUSE OF OUR WORK AND THE THE BOTTLES GENERATING CALIFORNIA WERE EVEN BEING SOLD TO CHINA -- THE IT USED TO BE A FIVE YEARS AGO EIGHT YEARS AGO AT THE MOST OF IT WAS SOLD BUT IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT HAS REALLY CHANGED AND NOW. VERY VERY LITTLE OF IT ACTUALLY WAS BEING SOLD TO CHINA -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO ONE SIXTY EIGHT BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE IS THE NEW ENORMOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL. A WELL IT MIGHT HELP SOME PEOPLE YOU HEARD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IT WOULD HELP -- IT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO HARM OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE MANY CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO RECYCLE PT. IN THE PACKAGING -- AS OPPOSED TO BOTTLES -- CRB BOTTLES OF THIS MANDATORY APPROACH IT REALLY TARGETS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE N. USES FOR P. T.. OF WHAT ABOUT THE NON CRV BOTTLES THERE'S A LOT OF THE USING RECYCLED CONTENT TODAY THAT. THE TWO THAT WOULD THEN BE A COP PLACED OUT OF THE MARKET. A BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY GOING TO INCREASE THE COST OF THE BALES TO UNSUSTAINABLE LEVELS AND IT'S GONNA HARM A HUGE PORTION OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN BUILT IN THE STATE. HOME THAT JADE THEY JUST DON'T HAPPEN TO MAKE CRB BOTTLES AS THEIR AND MARKET AND ASKING WHO TRY TO WRAP UP I'M ALMOST DONE HERE -- SO WE THINK THAT -- IT WILL REDUCE THE QUALITYOF THE BALES -- AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE AN APPROACH THAT DOESN'T PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS ONE THAT -- THAT WILL MEET THE GOALS BY USING FOR EXAMPLE THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PAYMENT THEM PROGRAM WHICH WE THINK THAT IT WOULD WORK BETTER AS AS A A CARROT RATHER THAN A STICK. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST ON KHAKI WITH MCCUE CAP CAN ASSIST IT'S ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POSED. REPLIED I CITY AUTHOR INTO THE COMMITTEE HEARD LETTER OUT WAS JUST AS A TAD BIT LEAKS OUT TO MAKE THE ANALYSIS WE DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. I'M IN TERMS OF THE CONCERNS I WE SHARE THE CONCERNS REGARDING PROVIDING BROAD AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT. A TO SET UP I'M POST CONSUMER CONTENT LEVELS -- ALTHOUGH WHO AND CERTAINLY THE LEAD AND THAT ACTIVITY ON IT LIMITS THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY ONCE THAT AUTHORITY BROAD AUTHORITY IS PROVIDED ON TO DECIDE TO ALTER COURSE ON A NUMBER OR ADDRESS CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS ON TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR OTHER OUR PRODUCTS SECTORS USING RECYCLED CONTENT AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY I AM AS WAS RAISED BY A PRIOR SPEAKERS. AND THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY AS TO WHAT PRODUCTS ARE WHAT I CONTAINERS WOULD BE IN SCOPE IS IT JUST THOSE THAT ARE UNDER THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM. AS IT BEYOND THAT IS IT ALL PACKAGING IN -- ENTIRELY ADDITIONALLY WITH REGARD TO THE JUNE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT SO THAT PLACE ONEROUS CERTIFICATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON MANUFACTURERS. IMPOSES SEVERE PENALTIES ARE CONCERNED THAT NOT ONLY WILL THAT IMPACT CERTAINLY LARGE MANUFACTURERS BUT SMALL MANUFACTURERS AS WELL HAVING AN IMPACT AND IS. JUST ONE OF THE ISSUES AROUND MAKING AYE HAVING THIS BE OUR MANUFACTURING BREAKER FROM CMT'S PERSPECTIVE. OF FINALLY WITH REGARD TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF FOR CAL RECYCLE TO PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH. POTENTIALLY REPLACE THE BOTTLE BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT FOCUS HOW WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THE LEGISLATURE WITH COMMENCEMENT GOING CHALLENGES WITH THE PROGRAM PERHAPS -- BUT IT DOESN'T AS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED CONTEMPLATE AND HOW THAT MIGHT DOES SOLVENCY ISSUES CONSUMER CONVENIENCE WHAT HAVE YOU MAY BE DRIEST MERELY JUST AYE HOUSE FOR REPORT ON WITHOUT KIND OF ANY. THAT CLEARER PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM IN SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT ARE PRETTY CRITICAL. BECAUSE OF WHAT FOR THOSE REASONS I'M WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL ON A BOOK FOR TO THE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN WRITTEN JUST TO COMBAT THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS JOE ACT ON BEHALF THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OPPOSED. PAT RILEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CURRENTLY OPPOSE THINKS. DENNIS SELBY ONLY HALF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS AMERICA POST THANK YOU. UNDERLYING CYPRESS CALIFORNIA -- I'D NOT INTENDED -- TO SPEAK TODAY ON THIS BILL DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT BUT THE AUTHOR HAS MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE TOWER CYCLE TO DO THIS. IT WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU IMPOSE STANDARDS OF COMPETENCE ON CAL RECYCLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MS MELENDEZ. AND I ASSUME YOU WON'T ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ARE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN YOUR CLOTHES PERHAPS BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW I GUESS I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHY WE ARE NOT PUTTING THESE STANDARDS INTO STATUTE HAVE IN THE LEGISLATURE. MAKE THAT DETERMINATION RATHER THAN CAL RECYCLE I KNOW YOU MADE SOME COMMENTS THAT YOU THOUGHT PERHAPS -- THE PROFESSIONALS WERE WARM AND BEST LEFT TO MAKE THAT DECISION I I DON'T KNOW THAT I AGREE WITH THAT I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOUR YOU KNOW THINKING WAS IN DOING SO WE COULD WE COULD. MISTER CHAIR WEEK WE COULD DO THAT NOW LITTLE HOUSE THE LEGISLATURE CAN COME IN AND SET STANDARDS I LIKE 35% THE EUROPEANS ARE GOING 260% ON GAS WEAKENED SOMEBODY CAN INTRODUCE APPEAR. A BILL AND DO THAT I CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT I I SAID I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE SOME EXPERTISE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING THIS COMMITTEE ON THE STUDY. CHANGES A PROBLEM EXTEND THE PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY AND SAYS GO OUT AND LOOK AT OTHER STATES FIND OUT WHAT'S WORKING WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR JUST EXTEND THE PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY AND AND COME BACK TO US LET US KNOW. IN SEE WHERE CAN WE FIX THE CAL RECYCLE PROGRAM WHAT COULD WE BE DOING BETTER ON ITS WITH SEARCH TWO PRONGS THAT THIS ARM ON THE ON THE CONTENT. WE COULD THERE'S EVEN AFTER THIS BILL IF WE COME BACK AND THEY SAID BECAUSE WE KNOW THE EUROPEANS ARE GOING 260% ON GLASSES JUST LOOK AT CLASS WHERE IF THEY CAME UP WITH A RECOMMENDATION BASED ON AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE IS DOING AND SAID WE THINK YOU SHOULD GET. TO FORTY WE COULD COME IN AND DO A BILL THAT SAYS WELL WE WANT TO GET TO FIFTY AND TWENTY THIRTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT PROHIBITS. ARE TAKING ACTION IN THE BILL. I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LET THE EXPERTS DO IT. OKAY SO IF MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY JUST -- TO EXPAND UPON THAT CAL RECYCLE. YOU KNOW IS FARR'S. SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS THAT THEY ARE RECYCLING THERE ONE DAY THEIR SOLVENT THE NEXT DAY THEY'RE NOT THE UP AND DOWN THERE OLIVER THE PLACE AND YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE. WHAT WOULD BE BEST JUST? FAR IS SEEN A WHAT LEVEL SHOULD BE SET I'M JUST I'M WONDERING WHERE THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IS COMING FROM THE CONSIDERING. PARTY I MEAN TO BE FAIR BUBBLE. THE AMENDMENTS THAT I'M TAKING IN THE COMMITTEE ALLOW CALORIE CYCLE TO ADJUST IT BASED ON THE PRICE OF OUR OIL BASED ON THESE MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH THEY CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE SAID THAT'S AN AMENDMENT THAT I ACCEPTED IN THE IN THE BILL TODAY TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT LITTLE. THAT MODULATION SO IT'S NOT STUCK IN BOULDER STONE I THINK STILL WELL MAYBE GOLD ISSUES BUT IT IS THE NUMBER THEY CAN MODIFY BASED ON THESE MARKET CONDITIONS AND AS WE GET THE INFORMATION BACK FROM THIS STUDY. PERHAPS WILL IMPROVE ON IT AGAIN SO IT'S NOT STATIC IS NOT STATIC BUT WE WANT TO WE WANT TO GET MORE RECYCLING ONE HAVE THESE MARKETS THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. BE MORE ROBUST IN WE GET THAT INFORMATION BACK SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ADJUSTMENT THAT WE MADE WITH THAT TO ANSWER TO THOSE CONCERNS. Q.

WELL GOOD AFTERNOON ALMOST GOOD EVENING -- THIS IS A MEASURE OF THE S. B. TWELVE SIXTY THIS IS THE AND ON THE BUS FIRE PREVENTION OF FORESTRY MANAGEMENT BILL. THAT WILL HOPEFULLY PROMOTE LONG TERM FOREST HEALTH AND WILDFIRE RESILIENCY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. DURING THE PAST YEAR AND INTO JANUARY AND NOW YET AGAIN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCING IN HAS EXPERIENCED THE LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES. AND WHILE FAR SEASON IN ITS HISTORY. NEARLY NINE THOUSAND WILDFIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IGNITED ACROSS THE STATE BURNED OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLIONACRES OF LAND DESTROYED MORETHAN TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STRUCTURES. AND KILLED AT LEAST FORTY FOUR PEOPLE. WITH ANOTHER TWENTY THREE BEING KILLED EARLY IN JANUARY AS A RESULT OF THE THOMAS FAR THEY CREATED A DEBRIS FLOW. THAT UP. I KILLED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY. POOR MANAGEMENT POLICIES THAT INTERRUPTED NATURAL FOREST LIFECYCLES COMBINED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE LEFT OUR FORESTS VULNERABLE TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. THIS BILL AIMS TO BREAK THAT CYCLE BY REORIENTING CALIFORNIA'S FOREST MANAGEMENT POLICIES. TOWARD LONG TERM FOREST HEALTH AND RESILIENCY. S. B. TWELVE SIXTY ENABLES FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT. AND CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAND MANAGERS TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISKS INCLUDING THROUGH THE EXPANDED USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE. MEMBERS NOW IS THE MOMENT FOR CALIFORNIA TO AGGRESSIVELY TACKLE ITS STATE WILD WIRE STATEWIDE WILDFIRE RISK IN A PROACTIVE MANNER. AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OUR LEAGUE LIZ FROSTBURG FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND STACY HEATON FROM THE RURAL COUNTY.

CALIFORNIA'S FORESTS ARE AT RISK HISTORIC MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND DECADES OF FIRE SUPPRESSION COMBINED WITH DRYER HOTTER CONDITIONS HAVE LEFT HER FORCE BONNEVILLE TO CATCH OF QUALIFIERS. S. B. TWELVE SIXTY INCREASES THESE PRESCRIBED FIRE TO HELP RETURN LANDSCAPES TO THEIR NATURAL BALLOTS WITH FIRE. ENHANCING COMMUNITY SAFETY AND IMPROVING FOREST HEALTH.

BOTH IN TERMS OF PROTECTING OUR MARINE LIFE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE OUR ECONOMY AND OUR QUALITY OF LIFE -- FIRST AGAIN I WOULD LIKE -- TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR CONTINUE PARTNERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE A WHICH HAS BEEN INVALUABLE IN OUR EFFORTS AND I ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LING MOUNTS. A CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND PARTNERSHIP AS WELL. WE HAVE ALL I THINK WORKED HARD TO ENSURE THAT OUR BEAUTIFUL DISTRICTS ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE STATE. REMAIN PROTECTED FROM EXPANDED OFFSHORE DRILLING. AND CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROTECTING ITS COSTA NOTIONS FROM THE STROLLING STARTING IN. NINETEEN TWENTY ONE WHEN WE WITHDREW CERTAIN OFFSHORE AREAS FROM OIL AND GAS LEASING PERIOD. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR UPON FINDING THAT OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION POSED TO NOT ACCEPT UNACCEPTABLY HIGH RISK TO OUR STATES MARINE ENVIRONMENT. THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED THE LANDMARK SANCTUARY ACT WHICH PROHIBITED NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN STATE WATERS. THIS BILL CONTINUES THAT TRADITION BY RESPONDING TO AN ACCELERATED PROPOSAL BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO OPEN UP WIDE SWATHS OF FEDERAL WATERS TO NEW OFFSHORE OIL DEVELOPMENT. AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS FULL WELL. THE NEW FEDERAL FIVE YEAR OFFSHORE LEASE PLAN WILL OPEN UP SEVERAL NEW LEASES AWFUL WEST COAST WITH SIX NEW RELEASES TARGETED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS THE FIRST NEW PROPOSED SALE OF LEASE TRACKS OFF OF CALIFORNIA SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY EITHER REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS. WHILE WE CANNOT LEGISLATE LEASING ACTIVITY IN FEDERAL WATERS WE HAVE NO JURISDICTION. WE CAN'T TAKE ALL MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR STATE WATERS AND ENSURE THAT STATE WATERS TO NOT FACILITATE THE TRANSPORT OF OIL PRODUCED FROM THESE NEW FEDERAL LEASES. BY MAKING THE ON SHORING OF NEW OIL MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WE STAND THE BEST CHANCE OF KEEPING NEW LEASES FROM BEING DEVELOPED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS THE MATH JUST ISN'T THERE TO MAKE OTHER OPTIONS VIABLE AND PROFITABLE IN OTHER WORDS IT WON'T PENCIL OUT. AND THAT IS OUR GOAL. IN FACT THIS MODEL PROHIBITING LEASING IN STATE WATERS WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN A BILL I DID LAST YEAR S. B.. ONE EIGHTY EIGHT OF MY OFFSHORE OIL BAND WE BILL FROM LAST YEAR AND HAS NOW BECOME THE PRIMARY BASIS FOR STATE BANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN FACT NEW YORK IN DELAWARE ARE DEBATING THE SAME BILL IN THEIR LEGISLATURES AND NEW JERSEY HAS ALREADY SIGNED THIS. ASSIGNED ONE OF THESE BILLS INTO LAW LEAH LEADING TO SEVERAL PRESS OUTLETS INCLUDING THE WASHINGTON POST TO POINT TO NEW JERSEY. AS THE NATIONAL LEADER IN THE OFFSHORE OIL FIGHT. NEW JERSEY. I'VE BEEN TO I'VE BEEN TO NEW JERSEY RECENTLY HARD TO BELIEVE THEY ARE TAKING THE LEAD BUT INDEED THEY ARE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY. UP REPUBLICAN STATES. REPUBLICAN STATES LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA FLORIDA ARE DIRECTLY NEGOTIATING WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO BE EXEMPTED. FROM FUTURE LEASE SALES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BLUE AND RED STATES ARE SAYING NO TO OFFSHORE DRILLING AND IT'S TIME WE HEARING CALIFORNIA FINALLY DO THE SAME. AND WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO WITNESSES TO SPEAK ON THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. MY FRIEND COLLEAGUE OF LONG STANDING LINDA CROP WHO IS THE SENIOR COUNSEL FOR THE SANTA BARBARA BASED ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER. AND NO OPEN HIME REPRESENTING THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS NO CONSECUTIVE [inaudible] PLACE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. S. B. EIGHT THIRTY FOUR DOES ENJOY BROAD SUPPORT FROM ENVIRONMENTALISTS BUSINESSES LABOR FISSURES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT IS CONSISTENT WITH ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION TWENTY NINE WHICH PASSED EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED IT IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL SANCTUARY ACT WHICH PROTECTS STATE WATERS. FROM LEASING BUT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR STATE FROM THE THREATS OF FEDERAL WE SING. OFF OF OUR COAST -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK BACK AND REALIZE THAT BOTH IN. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE OIL SPILL AS WELL AS THE MORE RECENT TWENTY FIFTEEN REFUGIO OIL SPILL. BOTH WERE RELATED TO FEDERAL OFFSHORE LEASES AND DEVELOPMENT SO OUR STATES COAST IS QUITE VULNERABLE AND CAN BE IMPACTED EVEN FROM LEASING AND DEVELOPMENT IN FEDERAL WATERS. BOTH OF THOSE BILLS NOT ONLY IMPACTED THE ENVIRONMENT BUT HAD DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON OUR COASTAL ECONOMIC SECTORS. S. B. EIGHT THIRTY FOUR IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR COAST FROM THE THREAT OF NEW FEDERAL OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT AND PROTECT OUR COASTAL RESOURCES AND ECONOMY. WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR WORK ON AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN VERY PLUG SHAMELESS PLUG [inaudible] ECHOING THAT.

AS WELL AS THE VALUES THAT COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND STEWARDS OF THE RESOURCES HAVE FOR THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE PROTECTION OF THE RESOURCES THAT OUR MEMBERS NEED FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL OUT WE MUST PROTECT OUR OCEANS FROM THE SCOURGE OF OFFSHORE OIL PRODUCTION. THANK YOU FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

FOR AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE VERY BRIEFLY SUCH AS WHAT THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE LAST COMMISSION CURRENTLY HAS EXISTING REGULATORY. AUTHORITY TO RESIDE OVER THESE MATTERS IN ADDITION BASED ON THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS -- ANALYSES AS WELL OTHER PRO DIVISION OF RENEWING -- PROSPECT THAT LEASES -- CAN ALSO PROVIDE -- POTENTIAL FISCAL IMPACTS ON THE LOSS OF PERSPECTIVE REVENUES AS WELL SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION IF YOU THINK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. A CALIFORNIA JUNIATA RIGHT THEN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE OPPOSED FOR THE ISSUE THAT IT MAY AFFECT EXISTING LEASES THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EQUIPMENT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO. IF THE GOAL IS. TO IF THE GOAL IS -- TO DECREASE. OUR PRODUCTION IN FEDERAL WATERS WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID YOUR GOAL WAS THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THAT QUESTION KNOW THE GOAL ISN'T TO DECREASE THE GOAL IS TO PREVENT FURTHER LEASING FOR EXPANSION OF LEASING IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING REDUCE. IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR EXISTING LEASES THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DRILL SADLY. BUT THIS BILL DOES NOT DEAL WITH ANYTHING OTHER THE EXPANSION OF LEASING THIS DEALS WITH RENEWAL AS WELL CORRECT. IT IT DEALS WITH THE TRANSMISSION ALL OF FEDERAL DOVE A OF OIL THROUGH STATE WATERS TOO THE OF THE VARIOUS REFINERIES AND SO FORTH IN OTHER WORDS THE CLOSEST THE STATE OFF. AS IT CREATES A WALL IF YOU WILL. IT CREATES A WALL IN A SO THAT NEW. OR EXPANDED LEASING OFF OF OUR FEDERAL WATERS CANNOT WE CANNOT DEVELOP NEW INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE THOUGHT THAT ADDITIONAL OIL SO. SO I UNDERSTAND -- THE POSITION THAT YOU AND THOSE LIKE YOU HAVE RELATING TO OPTION OFF SHORE DRILLING I DO -- I I DISAGREE BUT I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND IT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS IF THESE TYPES OF RESTRICTIONS ARE PUT INTO PLACE THEN WHERE WILL THE FUEL SOURCE THAT SO MANY RELY ON COME FROM. ELECTRIC VEHICLES CRIME DELIGHTED TO HAVE ONE I HAVEN'T HAD TO PUMP A DIME'S WORTH OF GAS IN MY OF CAR TO SINCE I PURCHASED IT A ON EVERYBODY HAS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE WILL HOPEFULLY WILL START MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION WE'RE NOT STOPPING OIL DRILLING. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE DON'T WANT TO EXPAND IT THERE ARE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE SHOULD BE DEVELOPING TODAY BUT TO REPLACE THE FOSSIL FUELS SENATOR CREATING THE PROBLEM IN OUR CLIMATE AND ENERGY? I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW RIGHT SO THERE IS OUR NEED INCREASES -- AS OUR POPULATION GROWS IT DOESN'T DECREASE SO I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN EFFORT TO USE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN'T OUR WHOLE PORTFOLIO CANNOT RELY SOLELY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW I MEAN FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO SO SO I'M JUST. I FEEL LIKE. YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT THIS THROUGH WITH RESPECT TO THE COST THAT WILL BE TO CALIFORNIA MOTORIST AND BUSINESSES AND THOSE WHO WORK IN THESE -- IN THIS INDUSTRY. I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S THAT WASN'T EVEN CONSIDERED WELL. IF YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID. I SAID WE'RE NOT STOPPING OIL DRILLING WHICH ASSERTING WE'RE NOT GOING TO WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT TO BE EXPANDED BEYOND AND RIGHT NOW FRANKLY OUR REFINERIES OR A CAPACITY. SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE OIL BEING DRILLED BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF WEANING OURSELVES OFF OF OIL OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. TO USE OTHER. NON FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY SOURCES SO THAT WE CAN. WE CAN STOP WORK CLIMATE CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE WHEAT YOU KNOW ALL THE EXPERTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS BASED UPON FOSSIL FUELS. AND WE ARE HOPEFULLY GOING -- TO REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY TRANSFER -- AS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE TO THE NON A INVASIVE NON -- FOSSIL BASED FUELS LIKE I MENTIONED ELECTRIC CARS WERE TALKING ABOUT HYDROGEN THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE SO WE CAN WEAN OURSELVES OFF WHAT WE KNOW IS A DIRTY FORM OF ENERGY. AND THIS BILL DOESN'T STOP US IT DOESN'T AFFECT A THE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE -- IN OUR STATE OF PEOPLE CAN START USING ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. A RAIL FOR EXAMPLE GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE BICYCLING TO AND FROM WHERE DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES THAT WILL HELP US WIN OURSELVES OFF OF THIS. A DIRTY FOSSIL FUEL AND THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD WANT TO EXPAND IT WHEN WE KNOW IT'S IMPACT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO ALLOW IT TO TO GROW IN ITS USAGE IS ANATHEMA. TO THE POLICIES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU MS MONEY HAS ANY FURTHER. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO EMPOWER UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND ACHIEVE TANGIBLE SUCCESS. TOWARDS HELP YOUR ENVIRONMENTS EACH YEAR THE STATE RECEIVES LARGE REVENUES FROM A VARIETY OF RESOURCES TO COMBAT POLLUTION AND CLEAN OUR AIR. ALTHOUGH WE HEAR MAYOR YOUR MARK MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR POLLUTED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BOTH RURAL AND URBAN THOSE VERY PLACES ARE STRUGGLING TO ACCESS THOSE DOLLARS. THEREBY COMPROMISING OUR CLIMATE ACTIONS. WITHOUT LARGE BUDGETS AND STAFF FOR OUTREACH OR GRANT WRITING FINDING AND APPLYING TO PROGRAMS IS DAUNTING AND A NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TASK. S. B. TEN SEVENTY TWO RESPONSE TO THE URGENT NEED TO ALIGN OUR CLIMATE PROGRAMS WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANT AND PASSIONATE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS. THESE REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING TO CREATE THE SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED.

WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE THEN -- AMY WILL TALK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE BILL AND HOW IT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS WE WANT TO SOLVE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE STATE HAS MADE A BIT. MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO MAKE INVESTMENT AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITY THIS IMPARTIALLY POLITIC COMMUNITIES. ARE A PRIORITY AS A RESULT. WE HAVE PUT POLICIES IN PLACE TO ENSURE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES RECEIVE FUNDING [inaudible] NOW WHETHER IT'S CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS S. B. ONE FUNDING OR THE RECENTLY PASSED PROP. SIXTY EIGHT BOND PARK ON WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT. WE ARE DIRECTLY TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE DOLLARS ARE VERY COMPETITIVE. AND AS A RESULT. THESE ARE THE SAME COMMUNITIES THE HOW TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ACCESSING THE DOLLARS INTENDED TO SERVE THEM. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE WITH SP. TEN SEVENTY TWO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THESE INVESTMENTS THE MOST ARE THE LEAST LIKELY EQUIPPED. TO PUT COMPETITORS GRANT APPLICATIONS TOGETHER TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING. THEY OFTEN DON'T HAVE GRANT WRITERS [inaudible] PROJECT MANAGERS. LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS OR PLANNERS TO COMPETE AGAINST THE COMMUNITIES TAT DO IN FACT. WE WORK IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND HAVE BEEN SEEN THIS PLAY OUT FOR DECADES. MUCH OF OUR WORK IS PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND GRANT WRITING ON BEHALF OF LOCAL NONPROFITS AND GOVERNMENTS. AND WE ARE VERY PROUD TO HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING GRANT FUNDING FROM SOME STATE. FROM THE STATE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF CAPACITY EVERYWHERE IT'S NEED IT. WE NEED TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY TO REALLY SEE THE DOLLAR SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT IN THE NEEDIEST PLACE THIS.

THAT'S THERE TO CONVENES TAKE ALTOGETHER AROUND OUR REGION EDUCATION PROJECT IDEATION RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT I'M ALL THESE CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES. A SECOND LAYER IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE -- ONCE A GIVEN COMMUNITY COMES TOGETHER AROUND A PROJECT IDEA THE TECHNICALS CONSIDERATIONS OFTENTIMES STILL REMAIN A CHALLENGE. I'M ARE A BILL -- SIMPLY SAYS THAT -- CLIMATE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A SHOULD ALL HAVE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPLEX SYSTEMS COMPONENT TO THAT WORK. I'M IN THE LAST LAYER IS SIMPLY A COORDINATION ALIGNMENT AND CENTER NUYS ATION ARE BILL IDENTIFIES AS SHE DID GROWTH COUNCIL.

OFFER WORKING SO DILIGENTLY WITH US ON AMENDMENTS OUGHT TO THE BILL WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF I KNOW I TOOK SOME WORK -- AND WE'RE HAPPY -- TO EXCEPT I THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ARE AND INCLUDING YOU ARE SPECIFICALLY MAKING SURE THAT OUR ATTORNEYS FEES AWARDS ARE RECIPROCAL IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WE AGREED TO SAID THANK YOU FOR THAT -- I AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH DIVE THE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL TIME IF WE'RE ABLE TO GET. A PASS TODAY'S HEARING UNTIL WE GET TO APPROPRIATIONS OF THANK YOU. THAT'S TRUE SEVENTY ONE IS A BILL. TO ADDRESS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL OVERSIGHT ARE REGARDING THE THEFT OF RECYCLABLE MATERIAL FROM SOLID WASTE ENTERPRISES. AUDITOR'S SANCTION MY LOCAL AGENCIES -- I KNOW -- HIM IN MY TWO RECYCLING FAST IS A BIG PROBLEM THAT UNDERMINES OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM -- AND ENDS UP COSTING CONSUMERS SIGNIFICANTLY. I CURRENTLY AS YOU KNOW MANY CITY SIGN FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS WITH WASTE ENTERPRISES WHETHER THROUGH COLLEGE HERE LOS ANGELES COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION OR ANY OTHER. A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS IS CURBSIDE COLLECTION PROGRAMS RECEIVE REVENUE OF A VARIABLE RATE MAKING BASED ON TIME IS SO WHY WASTE COLLECTED. THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED HOLDERS ARE COLLECTING SOLID WASTE BY ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES OR THEFT OF RECYCLING MATERIAL FROM THE CURB. OVER TIME THE STAFF HAS INVOLVED INTO LARGE SCALE CRIMINAL OPERATIONS WITH FLEETS OF VEHICLES MONITORING COLLECTION ROUTES OPEN THE OPERATING COMMUNITIES ON THE DESIGNATED COLLECTIONS DAYS AS A SHOP A LITTLE BIT BEFORE -- THE GARBAGE TRUCKS RECYCLING TRUCK SHOWS UP AND TAKE EVERYTHING WELL BEYOND ITS AYE AYE STEVENSON MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE I LIVE AND I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR YEARS AND I SAW MY NEIGHBORS. AND VERY FRUSTRATING OUT TO ALL OF US AND PEOPLE WONDER WHY ISN'T ANYONE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THESE -- CRIMINAL SYNDICATES -- CURRENT LAW AND THE REASON IS THE CURRENT LAW REALLY DOES NOT PROVIDE A REAL DISINCENTIVE -- TO FOR PEOPLE TO REFRAIN FROM STEALING -- VIOLATIONS ARE RARELY PROSECUTED BECAUSE PERPETRATORS ARE HARD TO TRACK AND LITIGATION COSTS ARE HIGH -- THIS BILL WOULD THEREFORE I PROHIBIT ANY PERSON OTHER THAN A SOLID WASTE ENTERPRISE AUTHORIZED BY THE COUNTY. FROM COLLECTING REMOVING OR TRANSPORTING SOLID WASTE -- AND IT AUTHORIZES LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES TO PURSUE CIVIL ACTIONS FOR THE THEFT OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS. AND OF THE PLAN IT PREVAILS IN A CIVIL ACTION OTHER COURT WILL WORD ARE REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES RECIPROCALLY -- AND OTHER COSTS INCURRED -- SUPPORTING OTHER SPILL OVER FIFTY LOCAL LOCALLY AUTHORIZE WASTE COLLECTION ENTERPRISES. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY ARE -- DETACHING FROM ECOLOGY HELGA FROM REPUBLIC SERVICES. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S ERIC PASSION WITH RECOLOGY RECOLOGY PROVIDES WASTE RECYCLING IN ORGANIC SERVICES TO OVER A HUNDRED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. A BUSY DEL NORTE COUNTY ALL THE WAY DOWN THE CURRENT COUNTIES OUR FOOTPRINT. SO IS THE CENTER SAID WE ARE EXPERIENCING THESE -- FAT ALONG LARGE SCALE THEFT IN A RECYCLING PROGRAMS -- WE'RE ALSO SEEING WHERE WERE AND MORE AMBITIOUS HONESTLY WITH A RECYCLING PROGRAMS. ON AUTHORIZED HOLLERS COMING IN GOING TO CUSTOMERS THAT FRANKLY ARE JUST LOOKING FOR CHEAP SERVICE AND PROVIDING THAT SERVICE WHERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DO SO -- WITH ACTION PROVIDE ME ACTUAL RECYCLING A BENEFICIAL SERVICES AT BOTH THE STATE MANDATES IN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MANDATE. THE IN THE DAY ARE -- PROCESSES IN OUR PROGRAMS ARE BASED OPERATE MODEL THAT RAY MODELS BASED ON TONNAGES CUSTOMER ACCOUNT IN REVENUE OFF OF RECYCLABLES NAM AS ROSSINI'S OF ACTIVITIES A GROWING GROW. THAT RATE MODELS CAN CHIP AWAY AT AN HONESTLY THAT. THE PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S FISCALLY SOUND POSTED BY PAY UNION WAGES FOR THE DRIVERS IN THE SORTERS ALL THAT GETS UPSET. AS THE SENATOR SAID THE ABILITY TO COLLECT ATTORNEYS FEES WILL GIVE US A CHARITY THAT WE SHOULD GO AND GO AFTER THESE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IN A WAY THAT WE KNOW THAT WILL AT LEAST BE ABLE TO STOP THIS ACTIVITY THANK YOU. NOT CHUCK CHO IT SEASON. AND THE COPS CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THE STAFF WORKING ON THIS. FOR OVER THREE YEARS NOW AND WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENT RATIONS OF THE SPELL AND IT'S BEEN PRETTY CONTENTIOUS AT TIMES. THE AMENDMENT AS PROPOSED REALLY DO ADDRESS MOST OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT ARE OUT THERE. ANY POTENTIAL CONCERNS OF UNFAIRNESS. OR OR ANY SORT OF ABUSE WAS REALLY ADDRESSED IN THAT MEN MINTS THAT ARE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. WHICH IS WHY WE'VE NOW COME ON IN SUPPORT -- WE'VE PASSED A VARIETY OF LAWS OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS TO A RECYCLING CALIFORNIA REALLY BE A LEADER NATIONALLY. AND I IN ORDER TO SUCCEED AND THOSE GOALS. WE NEED THAT THAT'S ALWAYS INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD -- PROJECTS AND FACILITIES THAT COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS IN LONG TERM. FEEDSTOCK COMMITMENTS AND THIS BILL GUARANTEE THAT IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR. AND HAS A THREE YEAR SUNSET TO ALLOW US TO COME BACK IN REVIEW HOW IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED THANK YOU OKAY. FUTURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHUCK HELD IT TO REPRESENT REPUBLIC SERVICES SO WE PROVIDE SOLID WASTE RECYCLING COMPOSTING AND COLLECTION SERVICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- JUST VERY BRIEFLY THE A FRANCHISE SYSTEM SAID BOTH OF PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. I MENTIONED ARE A PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH IT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT'S AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS. AND THROUGH THOSE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ESSENTIALLY IMPLEMENT AB NINE THIRTY NINE AND THE OTHER STATUTES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN AND RECORD OF THEM -- TH AND IT IS AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS IN AND WE THINK THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ARE BEST SUITED TO MAKE THOSE THOSE DECISIONS. FOUND THIS BILL DOESN'T AFFECT THAT PROCESS IN ANY WAY IT IT'S SIMPLY ADDS ATTORNEY'S FEES TO OUR ACTIONABLE. ITEMS WHEN WE TRIED WOULD FORCE OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT THANK. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. TENNIS LOW PURPLE WASTE CONNECTIONS IN SUPPORT. JOSH PUNNY FOR THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL SUPPORT. JEAN IRVINE ON BEHALF OF WASTE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT. ALRIGHT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. THEY MOVED INTO. DO YOU THINK CLEAR ONE CHAIR AND VICE IN SPACE FOR THE OPPOSITION. WELL. THEY DENNIS ALBION HIM ON BEHALF OF THE COMFORTING GREEN FEES ASSOCIATION THE PACIFIC EGG AND POULTRY ASSOCIATION. ON THE PACIFIC COAST RENNER'S SUSPICION. AND I THINK OF YOU FOLKS ARE GOING TO SPEAK TODAY ARE ON BEHALF OF ORGANIC RECYCLAGE WE'VE BEEN RECYCLING ORGANICS FAR BEFORE. THERE WAS CAL RECYCLE OR MANY THESE ENTITIES WERE INVOLVED IN THE RECYCLING SIDE THAT WAS THE THAT WAS THE IT WAS A SOLID WASTE I THINK [inaudible] INTERCHANGEABLY. AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE RECYCLERS LIKE THE BOTTLE BILL. JUST OVER THERE SO THIS IS REALLY THIS EXTENDS THIS TO THE SOLID WASTE TO THE GARBAGE SIDE OF THE BUSINESS OR IN OUR BILL WHAT WE DEAL WITH THIS ORGANICS. AND THE CONCERN IS THAT SOME OF THE ORGANICS. WE'LL BE THAT THAT THESE CHURCH OR CONTRACTS WILL BE ENFORCED AGAINST BOTH FOLKS THAT MAY BE. UP PICKING UP THAT ARE AT A CHARGE OR EVEN AGAINST FOLKS THAT ARE NOT -- THAT ARE THAT ARE PAYING FOR THE MATERIAL THEY WILL STILL GET A AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THEM AND THEN HAVE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. AND THAT'S A YOU KNOW THAT'S A THE TO COST SYMBOL OF OUR CLIENTS AND MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS OF OUR SMALLER ENTITIES. THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE IT SO THEY JUST WALK AWAY FROM A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT THEY HAVE. AND IT LIKE TO REMIND FOLKS THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR YOU PASSED A. B. THIRTY THIRTY SIX NOW HAS NOT BECOME LAW YET BUT IT IS MOVING TO THE PROCESS. THAT WAS TO DRESS THIS VERY STE ONE NARROW PART OF OUR CONCERNS WHICH IS. THAT WOULD ALLOW IT -- MATERIAL THAT'S INTENDED FOR LIVESTOCK FEED TO BE NOT DIE -- TO BE CATEGORIZED AS ALWAYS SO THAT ONE SMALL SO THIS GOES ON THE EXACT OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- WE WOULD LOVE TO IF. WE WE PROPOSE SOME. OUR ALTERNATIVES AND SOME SOME THINGS SAY HEY IF YOU'RE A LICENSED BUT DEPARTMENT WHO DIED TO DO GRAIN FEED IF YOU'RE THOSE CUTTINGS. THOSE ARE TYPES OF IDEAS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE FORWARD -- WE'RE TALKING TO THE TO THE FOLKS. THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING THIS IF THEY WANTED TO REMOVE ORGANICS FROM IT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER OPTION SO LOT OF OPTIONS CAN BE BROUGHT FORWARD TO TO MAKE THIS OUT WORK A LITTLE BETTER. ARE BASICALLY COMMENT NUMBER THREE FROM THE ANALYSIS IS REALLY WHERE WE ARE THAT THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT WE REPRESENT. OTHER WORKING IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. PROVIDING WORK PROVIDING THE SERVICE AND WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS SO THAT'S WHERE WERE YOU A THAT'S WHO WE REPRESENT AND WE OPPOSE -- THIS BILL AT THIS TIME AND LOOK FORWARD TO OUR TO WORKING OUT AS IT MOVES. GOOD AFTERNOON ABOUT CREAMERS A CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. VIRTUALLY WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED BECAUSE OUR MEMBERS RELY ON SOME OF THESE ORGANIC MATERIALS. ONE THERE HELPING TO PRODUCE THEM BUT TO THEIR ALSO HELPING TO USE AND THE END PRODUCTS IN THOSE BYPRODUCTS. FOR ANIMAL FEEDS A CALIFORNIA IS MADE UP OF BYPRODUCTS FROM OUR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES AND SO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IN MAKING IT HARDER TO ACCESS SOME OF THOSE MATERIALS AND SO WE WANT AS MISTER ALBION MENTIONED ON? THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTED AND PASSED A. B. THIRTY EARLIER WHICH WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE STILL CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE MATERIALS AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND ADDS COSTS TO THAT [inaudible] SO AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT INCLUDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME. FOR CODY BOILS AND A BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED ABOUT HIS ALLIANCE NEVER POST [inaudible] IF YOU. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MS EGGMAN -- THANK YOU AND I'M. SO MIKE MY CONCERNS URBAN MAN BAG BRAZIN ERIC AREA WITH A LOT OF AGRICULTURE AND THAT THE DEFINITION OF WASTE IS TOO BROAD. COM IF THE YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE FROM AB THIRTY THIRTY SIX IF IT DOES. IT. MOVES IT DEBT IT MOVES IT FROM THERE AND IT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE BY PROCESSING AND AND FOOD PRODUCTS -- SO I THINK THAT IS UP DIRECTION YOU WANT TO MOVE I MEAN I THINK WE NEED THE MARKET SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CERTAINTY ON THAT. HOWEVER. PRODUCTS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN GOING TO THE HOLLERS ARE HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN GOING TO LANDFILLS OR EVER THE TYPES OF PROCESSING PLANTS I DON'T THINK SHOULD BE. INCLUDED IN THAT AM. I GREW UP ON A FARM THERE'S A LOT OF APPLICATION TO THE ORCHARDS THAT HAD NO WASTE HAULER WANT -- BUT HELPS THINGS GROW SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS ARM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE AMENDMENTS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. I THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT INCORPORATING AN EXEMPTION FROM AB THREE A THREE SEX. I GUESS IT'S AYE SIR OF BE FOR ABOUT WHICH UPRIGHT POT BYPRODUCTS OR EXEMPTED AND WE ARE. GOING TO DO THAT -- IF IT'S INCLUDED IN THAT EXEMPTION WERE INCLUDED IN ITS ENTIRETY THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER WE WOULD BE THAT ENTIRE EXEMPTION OR OR ONLY. A MOVED -- SOBRE OPEN THE DOING THAT -- AND AND AND JUST TO BE VERY. CLEAR ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WAS DISCUSSED ARE NOT CORRECT. I'M NOT MISTAKEN. THANK YOU AS IT COMES MY COMMITTEE NEXT. I HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS ARE COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS. THIS NOTION OF THE THEFT OUT OF THE SYSTEM. BUT IN A LOT OF AREAS THAT ARE RURAL SORT OF MIXED RURAL. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT EASY TO DO AND IT'S AND THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A SITUATION WHERE. SOMEBODY WHO IS. HAULING OR CLEANING UP IS PER SE AUTHORIZED BY THE JURISDICTION TO GO CLEAN UP AND THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO THREAD HERE PREVENT THE THEFT OF IT BUT ALSO. ALLOW THE FUNCTIONS THAT WERE THERE WHEN THAT FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WAS PUT INTO PLACE. BECAUSE IT'S KNOWN THERE ARE. DIFFERENT ENTITIES HAULING THINGS LIKE WHO CARDBOARD OR WASTE FROM RESTAURANTS AGO RENDERERS OR THAT. ITO YARD TRIMMINGS OR AGRICULTURAL WASTE OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS AND ESPECIALLY AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE THE MIX -- OF OR OR FRINGES OF HIS IT THAT DON'T NECESSARILY COVER THE ENTIRE JURISDICTION BECAUSE A LOT OF PLACES DON'T HAVE CURBSIDE. RECYCLING OR WASTE ALL THAT SO THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A REAL MIX OF OF ENTITIES THERE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT BREAKING DOWN THOSE EXISTING SERVICES THAT ARE THERE. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO FUNCTION AND OPERATE IN THE WAY THAT WAS INTENDED BUT THEN STOP THAT WOULD. THE THEFT OF WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED WHEN THAT FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WAS PUT IN PLACE NOW THAT'S COULD BE DIFFERENT FOR JURISDICTION JURISDICTION FRANCHISE AGREEMENT FRANCHISE AGREEMENT THAT'S I THINK WHAT'S DIFFICULT. ABOUT THIS BILL AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE WE'RE STOPPING THE THOUGHT THAT THE FRANCHISE. THE FRANCHISEE GETS THE BENEFIT OF WHAT THEY HAD. NEGOTIATED AND TRY TO GET BUT ALSO ALLOW FOR THE EXISTING KINDS OF OPERATIONS THAT HAD BEEN THERE THAT WEREN'T NECESSARILY CONTEMPLATED THINK THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL SO THIS COULD BE SOME AMENDMENTS COMING UP IN THE NEXT MILLION JUDICIARY. I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOU HEAR MOVING FORWARD BUT I I HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WE GET THAT EXTRA UP THROUGH IT WILL CONTINUE TO OUR OWN WE WE WANT TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME AND MISTER HOGAN I THINK CAN. RESPOND RATHER JUST JUST A QUICK QUICK RESPONSE TO THAT ASSEMBLYMAN STONE AND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN. ON THIS BILL DOESN'T. EXPAND OUR AUTHORITY UNDER FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS IT THOUGH WHAT'S IN PLACE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WHICH CONTINUE TO BE IN PLACE. IT GIVES US THE AUTHORITY UNDER AND ADDITIONAL PIECE OF AUTHORITY. TO ASSESSED LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRANCHISE -- WITH THOSE EXISTING FRANCHISE AGREE SO WE'RE NOT EXPANDING THE FRIGHT BUT WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS FOR SOMEONE WITH A FRANCHISE AGREEMENT NOW. IRRITATED AT SOME OPERATION THAT HAS BEEN THERE IN BECAUSE THERE IS THE LEVERAGE OF ATTORNEY CAESAR AND AND OTHER IMPLICATIONS SAY I'M GONNA GO SHUT YOU DOWN [inaudible] WHEN? WHEN THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT? POTENTIALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATED BECAUSE THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY SOMEBODY WAS HAULING SOMETHING THAT IS APPROVED BY THAT JURISDICTION. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT AUTHORITY TO GO AFTER SOMEBODY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT JURISDICTION THAT THE OTHER PARTIES WOULD AGREE OKAY THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE GAVE YOU. SO YOU CAN GO STOP SOMEBODY ELSE FROM INFRINGING ON YOUR FRANCHISE BUT I DON'T WANT THE FRANCHISEE TO GO BEYOND. WHAT THAT EXPECTATION THIS WHICH IS WHY? SINCE WE'RE DOING STATEWIDE MAY. THERE NOT BE THAT EASY TO A SURLY DICTATE BY. BECAUSE OF SOME THE IT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES AND IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS INTERSECTIONS LIKE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS WE'VE DONE THIS. IN IN MY COUNTY. THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE DOING BUT I'M ALSO A LITTLE BIT LEADER MAKE SURE WE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TOO FAR OR INTERRUPTING THOSE OPERATIONS THAT THE COMMUNITIES COUNTY. THAT'S A AND I WHO OWNED A BELIEF THURSDAY SIR. THURSDAY I THINK WERE GOING TO BE INTO SURE. YEAH NEXT NEXT WEEK. IF NEXT WEEK MY APOLOGIES -- SO WE'LL HAVE SOME TIME TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL DO SO. ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

CHAIRMAN BUT THE THE THE ARE WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS IN A WAY THAT IS THOUGHTFUL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ON THE ONE HAND AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND. DEALING WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL CHALLENGE THAT WE FACED. AND THE HOUSE WE WERE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR THE PLATFORM HOLLY AND RINCON ISLAND. HAD BIG GIGANTIC PROBLEMS. WHAT HAPPENED WAS UNDER THE LAW THE WHEN THESE PLATFORMS WERE CLICK QUICK CLAIM BACK TO THE STATE BECAUSE THEY FILED BANKRUPTCY IN THERE WAS NO MONEY AVAILABLE? TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THIS STUFF. THERE'S A BOND THAT'S THAT'S POSTED IN THE BOND I THINK WAS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS MY RECOLLECTION WITH RESPECT A PLATFORM HOLLY BUT WE JUST HAD TO TRANSFER A HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND JUST TO PAY FOR PHASE ONE OF DECOMMISSIONING THE PLATFORM OF THE TAXPAYERS MONEY. MONEY THEY COULD USE FOR EDUCATION MONEY WE COULD USE TO CLEAN UP THE BEACHES MONEY WE COULD USE -- FOR FOSTER KIDS AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PROPER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THESE VARIOUS THINGS. WHAT WE AFTER WE WERE TRYING TO FIX THIS IN A SERIES OF BILLS THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY? IS BASICALLY ASKING THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FOR A BONDING THAT THEY HAVE FOR THESE THINGS WHEN THEY GO UPSIDE DOWN. AND SO THIS IS THIS BILL CAME AS A RESULT OF THOSE TWO BANKRUPTCIES LAST YEAR. AND I'M ASKING THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS MEASURE [inaudible] LET ME.

OKAY THANK YOU IN MY LAST BILL I'M GONNA PULL AND PUT THE CONTENTS TOMORROW IN YOUR BILL AND BUT SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. IT WE HAVE AUTHOR OF CENTER GLAZER. S. IS ITEM NUMBER THREE SB. FOUR FIFTY TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANNA FIRST -- BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE. THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH OUR OFFICE IN OUR SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL HE'S AMENDMENTS THAT ARE DETAILED IN THE HANDOUT PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE HELP FOCUS THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. ON RETURNING LONG TERM STABILITY TO THE RECYCLING COLLECTION IN CAPTURE. WHILE PROTECTING THE CONSUMERS ABILITY READING CONTAINERS. THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING ACT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. IN ORDER TO MARKET BASED SYSTEM TO REDUCE LITTER. AND INCREASE RECYCLING AT BOTH BY BACK CENTERS AND CURBSIDE. THE SYSTEM KNOWN AS THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM WHERE THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. HAS DIVERTED TONS OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS FROM LANDFILLS. AND FOR MOST OF THE LAST THREE DECADES HAS BEEN SEEN AS A MODEL RECYCLING PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY THE PROGRAM SUFFERED A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK BEGINNING IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STEMMING FROM A REDUCTION IN FEES PAID BY THE STATE. TO RECYCLERS AND A PRECIPITOUS A CLIENT IN GLOBAL COMMODITY PRICES. IT'S ONE TWO PUNCH LED TO THE CLOSURE OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND RECYCLING CENTERS. ROUGHLY 38% OF THE STATEWIDE TOTAL. LEAVING CONSUMERS IN MANY COMMUNITIES WITHOUT A LOCAL REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITY. THERE ARE NOW ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE CALIFORNIA CITIES INTO ENTIRE COUNTIES WITH NO OPERATING REDEMPTION CENTERS. SUBSEQUENTLY RECYCLING RATES HAVE DROPPED FROM A HIGH OF 85% FOUR YEARS AGO TO GET 75% LAST YEAR. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONTAINERS ARE STILL REDEEMED BY CONSUMERS FOR CASH. BUT BECAUSE OF CENTER CLOSURES CONSUMER REDEMPTIONS BEEN REDUCE BY UPWARDS OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH COMPARED. TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THIS BILL AS AMENDED WILL IMPLEMENT THREE KEY ELEMENTS TO STABILIZE THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. FIRST THE BILL RESTORE RECYCLING INCENTIVES TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LEVELS. REFLECTIVE OF COST OF LIVING AND REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURN ADJUSTMENTS. SECONDLY THE BILL RESTORE PLASTIC RECYCLING MARKET DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES THAT SUNSET AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND RECYCLERS WE'RE STILL EXPERIENCING DEPRESSED RECYCLING MARKETS. AND FINALLY THE BILL OR REFOCUS CAO RECYCLE. THEIR RESOURCES ON BRINGING RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES TO HUNDREDS OF UNDERSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WHILE PROVIDING LIMITED TEMPORARY RELIEF TO DEALERS FACE WITH TAKE BACK REQUIREMENTS AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I ASK RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY I'VE THREE WITNESSES WITH ME. TO ELABORATE OUT FIRST MARK MURRAY. I WOULD CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE SECONDLY JEFF DON LEVY FROM THINGS RECYCLING. AND THIRD JIM STATURE FROM VALLEY SPRINGS RECYCLING WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SIR BEFORE YOU PROCEED -- ARE YOU ACCEPTING ALL LOWER PROPOSED COMEDIAN AMENDMENTS FAN THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR THREE YEARS NOW -- THAT ALMOST A A PERFECT STORM OF A GLOBAL DROP IN COMMODITY PRICES COMBINED WITH A A REDUCTION IN PAYMENTS AND FROM CAL RECYCLE THE REDUCTION IN THE PAYMENTS WASN'T THE FAULT OF CAL RECYCLE. IT WAS THE FAULT OF AN OUTDATED FORMING SURVEYED EXPENDITURES. AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHICH AS AS CAL RECYCLE WAS SURVEYING THE EXPENDITURES TO DETERMINE THE NEXT PAYMENT. THEY WERE SERVING IN ENVIRONMENT WENT RECYCLERS WERE LOSING SO MUCH MONEY FOR BECAUSE OF THIS PRECIPITOUS DROP IN SCRAP VALUE. THAT ALL THEY COULD DO IS REPORT THE EXPENDITURES SO THAT'S WHAT WE GOT IN THIS MESS. THIS THE THREE SOLUTIONS THERE IN THIS BILL HAVE BEEN PART OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE BUDGET IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN I THINK THAT WERE NOW ALREADY. TO ADVANCE PEACE PROPOSALS THAT DETAILS -- A SOME OF THE THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT IN TERMS OF THESE AMENDMENTS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE TIME IN THE ENERGY OF THE STAFF -- THIS IS GOING TO RETURN PAYMENTS TO TWENTY FIFTEEN LEVELS AND THAT'S THE CORE ISSUE THAT WAS HARMING THE RECYCLING SECTOR. CLICK HERE FROM SOME REAL LIVE RECYCLERS. URGING AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JEFF DONLEVY WITH WINGS RECYCLING. PLANT MEANS RECYCLING HAS FACILITIES IN HAYWARD AND SACRAMENTO. THE COMPANY WAS STARTED BY A VIETNAMESE IMMIGRANT BACK IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND WE'VE GROWN TO BE ONE OF THE LARGEST PROCESSORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- DEATHLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE BUY MATERIAL FROM OVER A HUNDRED RECYCLING CENTERS SO YOU'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE OPERATORS. PRETTY MUCH EVERY WEEK AND BUSINESS IS JUST NOT GOOD -- COMMODITY PRICES ARE HURTING THE FORMULAS THAT THE STATE USES ARE DEATHLY OUTDATED -- WE'VE HAD FRIENDS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AND THEY JUST COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK ANYMORE. BECAUSE TOO MANY THINGS ARE IMPACTING THEY'RE BUSINESSES WE'VE HAD FRIENDS UP IN CRESCENT CITY THAT SHUT DOWN THEIR BUSINESS ANTICA. SAN JOSE. ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST RECYCLING CENTERS IN FRESNO WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING OUT OF THE BUSINESS. AND I JUST TALKED TO ONE OF THE LARGEST RECYCLERS IN CINEMA COUNTY OVER SANTA ROSA. AND BECAUSE THEIR COSTS HAVE GONE UP SO MUCH RECENTLY BECAUSE OF FIRES LAST YEAR THEY CAN'T GET LABOR THEY CAN'T GET TRACKING THEY'RE LOOKING AT SHUTTING DOWN THEIR OPERATION. SO WITH THIS -- PROPOSE BILL IT DOES CREATE SOME STABILITY OVER THE NEXT FEW. A FEW YEARS AND GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RECYCLERS TO WORK WITH POWER CYCLE. TO COME UP WITH SOME MORE LONG STE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS SO WITH THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. I AM SHIP SATCHER WITH VALLEY SPRINGS RECYCLING I WILL PUT OPERATOR RULE RECYCLING CENTER IN CALAVERAS COUNTY -- AND WE STARTED TWO THOUSAND SIX WITH ONE LOCATION VALLEY SPRINGS WE GREW TO WHERE WE WERE ACTUALLY DOING ALL THE MIX RECYCLING INTO IS SOME SORT -- OFFERING A SMALL MURPH -- AND WHICH WE CLOSE IN JANUARY BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE WERE THE ONLY RECYCLING CENTER LEFT STANDING A CALAVERAS COUNTY. A SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE -- OPENED SOME OF THESE CONVENE ZONE LOCATIONS HE SPENT BACK FIVE OF THEM ACROSS THE COUNTY RIGHT EFFORT -- TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE COMMUNITY TO RECYCLE BUT QUITE FRANKLY IS IT'S NOT A BUSINESS MODEL THE SUSTAINING ITSELF. AND IF SOMETHING IS NOT CHANGED TO A I CAN SEE WILL WE WILL BE RICH CLOSING THOSE LOCATIONS AND RESORTING BACK TORN -- YOU ARE FAR ARCHED ORIGIN THERE AND VALLEY SPRINGS -- AN EXAMPLE THAT I LIKE TO USE HERE IS THAT IN JULY ON JULY FIRST CAO RECYCLE IS GOING TO MANDATE THAT WE INCREASE OUR PAY OUT OF A TWO DOLLARS TWENTY EIGHT OKAY [inaudible] THESE FEES THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT OR THESE -- FUNDS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT REMAIN STAGNANT. SO I WILL IN SENSUALLY HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR THE PRODUCT BECAUSE YOU'RE TELLING ME I HAVE. TO AND I'M GONNA RECOVER LESS ON THE LOSE MARGIN ABOUT 2% MARGIN IN ALREADY. YOU KNOW. A LOSS LEADER SO. WE NEED HELP ME HELP IF YOU WANT US OUT THERE WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THIS IS A JOKE NO WAS. I DON'T KILL IT IN THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY TODAY SO ANY HELP THAT WE CAN GET FROM YOU -- WOULD HELP US SERVE THE COMMUNITY THAT'S REALLY ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO THANK.

HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN OUR BOTH OUR ELECTRICITY STORAGE AND AND OTHERWISE -- ESPECIALLY IF IT IS ME PRODUCED THROUGH OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES -- HYDROGEN THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN IS QUITE ENERGY INTENSIVE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SPLIT [inaudible] WATER INTO. HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN IN ORDER -- TO TO THEN OBTAIN THE HYDROGEN THAT'S THEN USED FOR FUELING OR ANY NUMBER OF PURPOSES. AND WITH CURRENTLY WITH OUR INCREASE AND RENEWABLE THE GENERATED ELECTRICITY WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE ELECTORAL THROUGH ELECTROLYTIC PROCESS PRODUCE THAT HYDROGEN IN A MUCH CLEANER WAY WHICH GIVES US THAN. TWO ZERO EMISSION SOURCES -- WHAT S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY NINE DOES IS DEFINED A NEW FORM OF STORAGE GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN AND ALLOW FOR UP TO THREE PILOT PROJECTS OF NO MORE THAN FIVE MEGAWATTS EACH -- WE IN THIS COMMITTEE IN. OH WAIT TILL THE I JUST WANT TO SPECIFY IN THIS COMMITTEE AND POLICE HERE AND CORRECT ME IF WE WILL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT WERE AGREED TO IN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. AND WE'VE HAD EXCELLENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OUR COMMITTEE STAFF. AROUND SOME LANGUAGE THAT IT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS COMMITTEE STAFF HAD. WHICH WHEN SWEET WE'VE JUST NOT LANDED ON THAT LANGUAGE WE'VE WE'VE STARTED TO LOOK AT SIMON WE'RE GETTING CLOSE BUT WE WOULD TAKE THAT LANGUAGE IN APPROACH WOULD WHATEVER WE AGREE TO WITH. YOUR COMMITTEE WE WOULD TAKE IN A PROBES THANK FUND OF HEDGE THEIR SO THERE WERE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE AYE A PROPOSED AND DISCUSSED IN THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE AND AND THAT -- YES CENTER YOU ARE AGREEING TO ADOPT AND BECAUSE THIS WAS DOUBLE REFERRED AND AS TO THE REMAINING ISSUES THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS RAISED. YOU ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS -- WITH ANY AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN IN THE APPROPRIATIONS CORRECT. NOTES FOR TIMING OF THE ALRIGHT PLEASE PROCEED. RIGHT SO -- I THINK I ALLOW MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND THEN ANY OTHER DETAILS I CAN DO IN MY CLOTHES. FULLER MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE MY NAME IS JACK BRAUER I'M A PROFESSOR IN MECHANICAL AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE. I DO RESEARCH ON THE DYNAMICS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ALSO ON ELECTRIC CHEMICAL ENERGY CONVERSION AND STORAGE. AND I'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING ALL KINDS OF FORMS OF STORAGE -- THAT INCLUDE BATTERIES AND ELECTROLYSIS AND HYDROGEN AND PUMP HYDRO AND HEART DISEASE. AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER FORM OF STORAGE THAT WOULD ENABLE THE FEATURES WE NEED. FOR MASSIVE AND EVEN A 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY ECONOMIES THERE'S NO OTHER THING THAT CAN DO THAT WITH ZERO EMISSIONS. OTHER THAN HYDROGEN. HYDROGEN IS THAT -- ONE HAS THESE FEATURES THAT CAN ENABLE LONG TERM. AND MASSIVE ENERGY STORAGE THAT WE WILL EVENTUALLY NEED FOR A IT ALSO ENDS UP BEING A VERY GOOD TOOL FOR D. CARBON ISING WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AS OUR GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DO IT ON A MASSIVE SCALE. EVEN IF WE USED ALL THE BIO GAS AND BIOMASS THAT'S AVAILABLE TO US WE COULDN'T DE CARBONIZED IT COMPLETELY [inaudible] BUT HYDROGEN. MADE FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY COULD DO THAT FOR US. FINALLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT. CURRENTLY IF WE GO ON THE SAME PATH OF ELECTRIFYING EVERYTHING. AND TRYING TO MEET ALL THE DEMANDS WE CURRENTLY MEET WITH BOTH GAS AND ELECTRICITY WE WOULD HAVE TO MORE THAN TRIPLE. OUR ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IDEA OF MAKING HYDROGEN FROM RENEWABLES ENABLES US TO ELECTRIFY EVEN THOSE VERY DIFFICULT TO ELECTRIFY END USES THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF STORAGE WE NEED. THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND THINGS LIKE THIS -- AND OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT'S A MUCH LESS COSTLY. THAN TRYING TO REPLACE ALL OF THOSE CURRENT GAS PLANTS THINGS LIKE THAT TO REPURPOSE THOSE THINGS OKAY WITH ZERO OMITTING. HYDROGEN FROM RENEWABLES. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW THAT. LORRAINE PASS GADSON WITH BUT YOU NORTH AND I'M ALSO HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THAT CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL. I'M ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THAT ASSOCIATION AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. AND WE ARE THRILLED THAT SENATOR SKINNER HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE AT A TIME IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE HAVE A VEIL OF ABUNDANT AVAILABLE -- LOW COST SOLAR AND OTHER RENEWABLE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE AND OPTIMIZING CONVERTING TO HYDROGEN USE HYDROGEN FROM MULTIPLE AND USES SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. WE ALSO APPRECIATE OF A LOT OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE CHIEF CONSULTANT HAS DONE WITH US TO TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES -- IN THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF OF FOR A RESOLUTION ON THAT SIR THANK YOU IN WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THE SPELL. THANKS VERY MUCH. FOR THE WITNESSES AND SUPPORT A GOOD EVENING SILVIO FURRY MAP THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NO FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PATRICK WHAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. THAT WE HAVE AN OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION OUR CONCERNS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH AUTHORED APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WITH HER ON THIS IN THE SPONSOR'S WELL -- ARE WITH THE I RP LANGUAGE IN THE AND THE BILL AYE WE AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT THAT REQUIRING CONSIDERATION OF GREEN HYDROGEN EACH IRP IS PREMATURE AT THIS TIME WE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES RECOMMENDATION TO REMOVE THAT LANGUAGE -- FROM THE BILL UNDERSTAND THAT. TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE -- ON THAT PROVISION WE'VE SUBMITTED ALSO -- SAN ADDITIONAL IDEAS ADD TO THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION AND AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM IN THIS COMMITTEE -- AS WE WORK ON THAT LANGUAGE AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR POSITION THANK YOU. I THINK YOU. SENIOR FOR THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY OF QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MS RICE. I DO APPRECIATE THAT. VM. THE LESSON FROM THE PROFESSOR -- IT HITS IT SO. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT I'M GLAD IT'S A PILOT PROJECT. UP BECAUSE IT IS SO EXPENSIVE I KNOW THAT YOU YOU PRESENTED IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU'RE COMPARING YOU KNOW. MOVING RESOURCES FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER BUT IT STILL IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONES BUT SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT SO I DO APPRECIATE THIS AS A PILOT PROJECT AND I'M PREPARED TO SAY. TO SUPPORTED I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. ALRIGHT -- SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SATYR WHICH LIKE CLOTHES THANK YOU AND IT IS THE I RP SECTION THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH STAFF ON TO PLANNED ON APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE SO [inaudible] AND I THINK THE I CARRIED THE BILL ON STORAGE BACK IN. SEE WHAT YOUR WAS IT NOW 201-1 I THINK -- A COULD BE OFF BY YEAR BUT ANYWAY AND AT THAT POINT I WOULDN'T HAVE CONSIDERED HYDROGEN BECAUSE WE WERE NOT WE DID NOT AS THE STATE HAVE THAT ARE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY. THAT WE ARE PRODUCING THAT WAS GENERATED FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES WAS NOT YET THAT HIGH IT WAS ALSO STILL RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE IT'S COME DOWN A GREAT DEAL IN PRICE. AND OBVIOUSLY WEARE WE'VE NOW ADOPTED IT -- A 50% GOAL AND WE MAY EVEN GO HIGHER BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS WE GENERATE MORE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY THERE ARE TIMES IN THE DAY WHERE WE ARE NOT UTILIZING AS MUCH OF IT. AND SO IF WE HAVE A WAY TO CAPTURE THEN. SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO GIVE US THAT ABILITY TO PILOT AND TEST THE GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN PROCESS AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANKS VERY MUCH SENATOR IDEA. ALSO SUPPORT THE BILL AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO MOVE SECOND. RIGHT. ROLL CALL PLEASE.

FOURTEEN FORTY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- I LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND YOUR STAFF. FOR THE TIME THAT YOU'VE SPENT WITH US -- AND FOR THE WONDERFUL COULD COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. I WOULD LIKE -- TO COMMIT FOR THE ON THE RECORD. THEN I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WITH ONE MINOR CLARIFICATION LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT FOR YOU. RIGHT NOW THE BILL TODAY. HAS A TYPO THAT SETS A EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS. THIRTY TO BE CF UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY AND THEN I I THINK WHAT WAS MEANT WAS BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND THAT WOULD -- I I'D LIKE. TO ASK YOU TO MAKE THAT ONE MINOR CHANGE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS ADDED IN THE REPORT THAT CAN BE. S. AS SORRY FOR THOSE ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS MATTER AND WE WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE THAT. IN YOUR STAFF SPREAD THROUGH RIGHT OF THE BILL THAT COULD BE PLEATS IF WE CONCLUDE THAT. YES -- I WANT TO ASK GOOD. A LESSER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE AS TO THE NATURE THE MAN MEANT -- THAT HAS BEEN -- VETTED BY COMMITTEE STAFF AND AND I THINK THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE IN ADVERTISED FOR THAT WE CAN CORRECT VERY EASILY. BUT JUDGES GENERALLY -- WHAT THIS BILL DOES [inaudible] HERE'S A IT WOULD -- CREATE A NEW PROCUREMENT STRATEGY. FOR FOR BIO GAS IN AND WITHIN OUR OUR OUR GUESTS NETWORK. AND THIS -- THIS BILL AGAIN WOULD HELP US ADDRESS. THE ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE -- TROUBLES THAT WE'RE FACING. WE KNOW THAT -- CALIFORNIA AS AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE WORLD ISSUES FACING. THE THREAT OFCLIMATE CHANGE EVERY SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY ECONOMY. IS INVOLVED IN. A FIT INTO A CARBON CONSTRAINED FUTURE. SIXTEEN YEARS AGO THIS LEGISLATURE BEGAN WORK ON THE CARBONATES IN THE ELECTRIC SECTOR. THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF A PROCUREMENT MAN MANDATE. KNOWN AS RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. TODAY WE ARE AHEAD OF OUR SCHEDULED TO GET 250% RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY [inaudible] BY [inaudible] TWENTY THIRTY IN LIGHT OF THIS PROGRESS STUDIES SHOW THAT NATURAL GAS WILL CONTINUE. A PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. AS A RELIABLE FUEL SOURCE FOR HEAT AND ELECTRICITY GENERATION. WE'VE SANE AND SOME CASES AS WE'VE RETOOLED. THE AN IN GAS USED. THIS YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT. THERE ARE SOME STRATEGIES THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FUTURE WITHOUT GAS BUT THAT IS VERY VERY FAR IN THE FUTURE. TODAY WE CAN ACTUALLY. IF AT ALL ACTUALLY BECAUSE TODAY WE WE ARE NOW SEEING THAT GAS. IS NOT ONLY -- CLEANER THAN MANY FUEL SOURCES BUT ACTUALLY HAS A NEGATIVE. CARBON FOOTPRINT. WE'RE SEEING THAT -- WERE SEQUESTERING GAS THAT. AT A LANDFILLS AND IN -- GARY FARMS DIFFERENT PLATE PARTS OF THE OF THE STATE. AND WE CAN USE THAT SEQUESTERED GAS INTO OF FUEL. THAT WOULD HELP US ACTUALLY CLEAN THE EARTH CLEAN THE AIR AND CREATE A VIBRANT ECONOMY. WHEN I FIRST GOT TO THE SENATE I CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE? THIS IS ONE STRATEGY OF ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S IN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT. THE MORE MONEY WE SPEND. ON LOCALLY GENERATE ELECTRICITY MEANS THE MORE. JOBS WE CREATE AND STATE. THE THE MORE OF OUR OUR OF OUR ECONOMIES DOLLAR STATE WITHIN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY WHICH HELPS TO BUILD WEALTH. WITHIN OUR ECONOMY AND IT'S A STRATEGY TO HELP CONTINUE TO BUILD OUR ECONOMY CALIFORNIA. IS NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND WE GOT THERE. BY MAKING INVESTMENTS WITHIN OUR STATE MAKING SURE OUR STATE PRODUCES THINGS. AND THAT WE CONSUME CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCTS. RIGHT NOW 80% OF OUR NATURAL GAS COMES FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE. THAT IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNTOF MONEY LEAVING OUR ECONOMY EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WE ARE NOT ONLY IMPORTANT IN. A GAS THAT POLLUTES THE AIR WERE ALSO -- POLLUTING THE AIR IN TRANSPORTING AND HEAR FROM AS FAR OFF AS A STRAY LEAH. THIS IS -- SOMETHING'S GOT AT WE'VE GOT WORK TO TO MINIMIZE BUT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GRIP CHU CHU EXPAND CERTAIN BUSINESS PLANS IN OUR STATE WITH THIS POLICY. AND AND OUR OUR OUR OUR FARMERS CAN CAN TAP INTO THE ENERGY MARKETS NOW THEY CAN PARTICIPATE. AND BECOME -- SUPPLIERS OF OUR OF OUR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A A MEASURE THAT IF YOU IF YOU SUPPORT CREATING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A GREAT MEASURE TO SUPPORT. IF YOU SUPPORT CLEANING THEIR THIS IS A GREAT MEASURE TO SUPPORT. AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN AND MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD -- WERE WERE SO MAKE MAKING AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WE HAVE WE HAVE -- WELL WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD ON AT EACH AND COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES THAT WERE REQUIRED OF US IN AND ENERGY COMMITTEE WE HAD WORK THAT HONORS OUR SIMONE. SOME OF SOME OF OUR OWN COST CONTAINING. OF MEASURES UP OR LANGUAGE I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THAT I HAVE I COMMITTED LAST COMMITTEE TO WORK WITH TO CHAIR. TO MAKE SURE WE COME UP WITH THE RIGHT LANGUAGE WE ASK THAT YOU GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE. TO WORK WITH CHAIRMAN HOLDEN I UNDERSTAND THE IMAGE CHAIR ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT AND WE ARE. WE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO COME UP WITH THE RIGHT LANGUAGE. IF YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T WILL WILL WILL START MOVING FORWARD BUT WE WILL DO IT ONLY. WITH WITH THIS COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL. AND OF COURSE AND WITH ENERGY COMMITTEES APPROVALS WELL WE THINK WE'RE VERY VERY CLOSE ON THE DETAILS. AND AND WE WILL GET THERE WITH YOUR SUPPORT. HAVE BUT FOR TODAY I ASK FOR YOU ARE ABLE TO HELP US MOVE FORWARD AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON CRAFTING. THE THE YOU KNOW THE DEVIL'S ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS WE WANT TO GET TO THOSE DETAILS IN CRAFTING THIS LANGUAGE. AND AND WE ASK THAT YOU ALLOWS THE THE UP TO TO CONSIDER DO THAT. WE HAVE TODAY -- TO TO BE A TEST OF FIRE ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS HOWEVER THE COMMITTEE -- WISHES WE HAVE NICK POOR WITH THE COALITION FOR NO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. WE HAVE TIM KARMIC. CARMICHAEL WITH SO CALLED GAS. AND KATIE DONAHUE DURAN OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL OF LABOR'S TO SPEAK. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND TO ALSO ASK YOU QUESTIONS IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN RIGHT STYGIAN MEMBERS EVENING ACTUALLY I NEED TO GO FOR COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS I AM PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS BILL -- THIS BILL IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF LANDMARK LEGISLATION PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE LARA WHICH REQUIRED A 75% REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF ORGANICS GOING TO LANDFILLS BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN A 40% REDUCTION METHANE STATEWIDE BY TWENTY THIRTY IF. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD EXPLICITLY STATED IN A TRUCK LIVE CLIMATE POLLUTANT STRATEGY THAT ORDER TO MEET OUR METHANE REDUCTION GOALS THE STATE'S ORGANIC WASTES SHOULD BE PUT TO BENEFICIAL USE AS PIPELINE INJECTED RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. ALSO AS PART OF THAT THOUGH THERE IS AN ANALYSIS DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION THAT I WILL I DISTRIBUTE AS SOON AS I'M DONE TESTIFYING -- THAT FINDS THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY MORE THAN EIGHTY BILLION CUBIC FEET OF ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE METHANE BEING EMITTED TODAY FROM LANDFILLS DAIRYMAN NOR AND WASTE OUR TREATMENT PLANTS IN YOUR DISTRICTS. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY WOULDN'T WE USE THIS DOMESTIC FUEL SOURCE TO DISPLACE FOSSIL NATURAL GAS WHICH IS BEING IMPORTED FROM OUT OF STATE. ALTHOUGH NOT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WOULD BE A VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE STATUS QUO OF USING FOSSIL GAS ROUTE OF STATE. WHEN THERE'S A DOMESTIC RESOURCE AS COST EFFECTIVELY AVAILABLE? CURRENT ESTIMATES THAT ORGANIC WASTE CAN SUPPLY ENOUGH RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS TO SUPPLY AN OUTSTANDING TWO MILLION RESIDENTIAL UNITS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS BEING SUPPORTED BY OVER FORTY TWO ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS LIKE THE CLIMATE TRUST AND ENERGY VISION. LABOR GROUPS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA COUNCIL OPERATING ENGINEERS. BUSINESS GROUPS LIKE THE LA COUNTY LABOR FEDERATION ARE TO BUSINESS FEDERATION. AND PUBLIC ENTITIES INCLUDING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION DISTRICT SOME OF THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. MEANING CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE TIM CARMICHAEL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS. FOR WHAT IT CAN DO TO HELP THE STATEMEET IS SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS PLAN DELIVER ON THAT. S. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PLAN FOR THE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS THAT. THIS PROGRAM CAN HELP DELIVER AND FOR THE THE BENEFITS ARE REAL RELATED TO OUR ORGANIC WAY STREAMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT THIS LEGISLATION CAN HELP -- WITH -- WE CONTINUE SUPPORT THE BILL KNOWING THAT WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE ASSEMBLY CHILES COMMITTEE. ON APPROPRIATE COST CONTROLS AND A MECHANISM TO RECOVERING RATES THE COST OF THE FUEL THERE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS KITTY DONE HIT AROUND WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL LEVERS HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. FOURTEEN FORTY ALSO NOTE THAT OUR DIRECTOR JOSE ME HERE ALSO CURRENTLY SITS ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE THAT NATURAL GAS. BY OMITTING PRODUCTIVE FACILITIES ATTRACT BETWEEN TEN TO SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT AND CREATE UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE JOBS PER PROJECT. WE BELIEVE THE PROCUREMENT GOALS SET FORTH IN S. B. FOURTEEN FORTY WILL ENABLE UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NEW PROJECTS TO BE DEVELOPED CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR INVESTMENT OF UP TO TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NEW JOBS IN THE STATE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABLE THIS EVENING THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RESEARCHER REMEMBER SCOTT WHICH I'M AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRONS COUNCIL AND THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES IT REPRESENTS ALL THE GAS WORKERS IT. ATA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND AT PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC WE'D URGING AYE VOTE. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHUCK HELD IT REPRESENTING REPUBLIC SERVICES WERE MOVING OUR OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE MET THE BILL AS AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH PANEM BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNTS WHEN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. JERRY MEMBERS MIGHT DILLON REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES AND COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT OF LOS ANGELES IN SUPPORT. HI GOOD EVENING WRITING KENNY CLEAN ENERGY WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WORKING WITH US WE ARE SUPPORT IF AMENDED THANK YOU. JEAN IRVINE REPRESENTING WASTE MANAGEMENT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. TO THE ELEVEN BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WERE SUPPORTIVE AMENDED THAT HOPE TO MOVE TO FULL SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICHAEL VOCAL OR ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION WHERE IN THE UNIQUE POSITION THAT WE HAVE BOTH. PROPONENTS OF PROJECTS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LARGEST NATURAL GAS USER SINCE AND STATE. SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HEAR SENATOR WAY SAYS EXPLICIT COMMITMENT TO INCLUDE COST CONTAINMENT LANGUAGE. OR HE WON'T MOVE THE BILL FORWARD THAT'S ARE CRITICAL AMENDMENT WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR WITH THAT WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOW ANTI JACK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA DAIRIES IN CALIFORNIA TOMATO GROWERS ASSOCIATION WESTERN ACT PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD EVENING VALERIE TRAIL OF LA HOSTS WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY NO FORMAL POSITION BUT WANTED TO TESTIFY SORT OF WITH THIS SEGMENT OF WITNESSES -- THAT WE ARE VERY -- THE CONVERSATION IN THE COMMITTEE'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THAT STRICT COST CAP. LIKE MANY OTHER COLLEAGUES SAID WE WANT TO BE A PART OF OUR MEETING ARE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS GOALS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILK FORCE WORKING WITH YOU CLOSELY. YOU FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FOR GETTING CHAIR MEMBERS PHOEBE SETON LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ALSO ON ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT. A WELL WE ARE OF COURSE VERY SUPPORTIVE REDUCING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS IN CALIFORNIA SP FOURTEEN FORTY SIMPLY DOES NOT CREATE. AN EFFECTIVE OR ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND MEANS OF DOING SO. OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH SP FOURTEEN FORTIES APPROACH ARE THAT IT'S PREMATURE IT PRIORITIZES BY A METHANE PRODUCTION OVER OTHER MEANS OF REDUCING METHANE. AND DOES NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDER LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF MANEUVER GENERATION AND CONVERSION INTO ENERGY. BIO METHANE PRODUCTION FROM DAIRIES HAS AN UNPROVEN TRACK RECORD THE COST FEASIBILITY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BIO METHANE PRODUCTION FROM DAIRY SHOULD BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD. BEFORE SETTING PROCUREMENT MANDATES CONVENIENTLY THE CPUC IT'S CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF DARROW TERRY BY A METHANE PROJECTS. THROUGH A PRIVATE PILOT PROGRAM THAT WILL THAT AVAIL EVALUATE SCALABILITY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION COST EFFECTIVENESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. RATHER THAN RUSH TO PROCUREMENT MANDATE WE SHOULD WAIT TILL THESE PILOT PROJECTS HAVE RUN THEIR COURSE AND ARE EVALUATED. FURTHER BY FOCUSING ON MANDATORY PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS IN PRIORITIZING BY A METHANE GENERATION SP FORTUNE FORTY WOULD LIMIT MEANINGFUL CONSIDERATION OF STRATEGIES. THAT CAN REDUCE METHANE AT A LOWER COST WITH FEWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MARCO BENEFITS A SET OF EVER EXPANDING INCENTIVES FOR BY A METHANE PRODUCTION THAT FURTHER COMMODIFIED METHANE. MAY RESULT IN PERVERSE INCENTIVES TO GENERATE MORE METHANE FROM DAIRIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR AND FACILITATE THE COULD FACILITATE THE CONSOLIDATION OF DAIRY OPERATIONS. WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE SEVERITY OF ASSOCIATED. LOCAL AIR WATER AND UBER IMPACTS. S. B. FOURTEEN FORTIES PREFERENCE FOR METHANE GENERATION RATHER THAN RESTING AVOIDANCE WILL LIKELY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LOCALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BY INCENTIVIZING LARGER HERD SIZES THAT CAN BETTER CAPITALIZE ON THE REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF NOTHING. THE DAIRIES IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ARE THE REGION'S LARGEST SOURCE OF OZONE FORMING VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPROMISED AIR BASIN. EXPANDED DAIRY OPERATIONS AND INCREASED WILL LEAD TO INCREASED EMISSIONS FROM SILAGE WEANED YOUR INTERCONNECTIONS -- LEADING TO INCREASED EMISSIONS AND VOCS AMMONIUM KNOCKS HYDROGEN SULFIDE REACTIVE ORGANIC. GASES AND SO ON AND SO ON RESULTING IN INCREASED PARTICULATE MATTER AND OZONE WHICH IN TURN -- EXACERBATE RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA. AND PREMATURE DEATH -- EH ADDITIONALLY INCREASED -- HEARD SIZE AND DAIRY OPERATIONS CAN IMPACT GROUNDWATER AS WELL WITH INCREASE ANYWHERE AND ANNA NITRATE LOADING TO GROUNDWATER. WE UNDERSTAND THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL EARLIER TODAY CIRCULATED A TABLE THAT EXTENSIVELY DEMONSTRATED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM DAY DIGESTERS. IT IS UNCLEAR TO US WHAT DATA AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLIE THESE ANALYSES AND QUESTION WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF DIGESTION ARE ASSESSED IN COMPARISON [inaudible] TO IF. FOR EXAMPLE DIGEST OPERATIONS ARE COMPARED TO OPEN ONLINE LAGOONS AND RELIANCE ON DIESEL ENERGY THAT ANALYSIS FAILS TO CONSIDER THE MANY MANY LESS CENTRAL SCENARIOS INCLUDING OF COURSE. ALTERNATE MINOA MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LOWER EMISSION OR ZERO EMISSION ENERGY SOURCES. WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE. ERICA MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF EARTH JUSTICE AND WE ARE A NONPROFIT LAW FIRM AND I'M HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE COMMUNITY VOICES. THAT AND THE REASONS WE JUST HEARD THEM OUTLINED WHY THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY LEADERSHIP CONTINUE BUT THAT THE VOICES OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THAT WILL BE MOST IMPACTED ARE ALSO PART OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA BRINGS FORWARD. PACIFIC LEAVE FOR ITS JUSTICE WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO OPPOSE THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU BECAUSE IT'S PREMATURE. TO SET A PROCUREMENT MANDATE UNTIL PILOT PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED TO DETERMINE FEASIBILITY OF BIO METHANE PRODUCTIONS FROM DAIRIES. AS YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIA ENERGY POLICY. THIS BODY HAS MADE A DECISION THAT WE NEEDED MORE INFORMATION FROM THE PILOT PROJECTS NOW YOU'RE REVERSING. THAT STANCE [inaudible] AND ACTING [inaudible] PERHAPS PREMATURELY. AS YOU CONSIDER THE BILL BEFORE YOU WOULD ASK YOU TO PLEASE. TAKE A MOMENT. TO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THE SPILL TO INCLUDE ALL VOICES IN ENERGY POLICY IN CALIFORNIA AND TO OPPOSE THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION RE REPRESENT OVER FORTY UP PUBLICLY AND ELECTRIC UTILITIES RUN THE STATE MANY OF WHOM OWN AND OPERATE THEIR OWN A NATURAL GAS AT GENERATING UNITS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THE GAS CORPORATIONS EITHER FOR TRANSPORTATION. OR FOR THE GAS ITSELF WE HAVE HAD CONCERNS ALL ALONG THAT THAT THE BIO METHANE MANDATE IN THIS BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE COSTS ON OUR MEMBERS AND THEREFORE. BECAUSE ON A STICK NEED TO CONSIDER RAISING ELECTRICITY RATES TO COVER THOSE ACCESS COSTS WINNERS IN THAT AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. IN THE ASSEMBLY. UTILITIES COMMITTEE THAT MAY REMOVE THE MANDATE IN THE BILL THAT THOSE COST BE PASSED ON TO GAS CORPORATION CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BEEN PROVIDE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE TAKEN IN THIS COMMITTEE. SO WILL BE REVIEWING THE BILL ONCE EVERYTHING IS IN PRINT WE SEE WHERE THINGS ARE AT AND TO REASSESS OUR POSITION BUT AGAIN OUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL IS IMPACT ON ON CONSUMERS. AND AND REPAIRS THANK YOU. THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YEAH GOOD AND EVENING ON MY NAME IS AND I ASKED HIM HOW BEHALF FOR THE CALIFORNIA ROOMS TO SCIENCE AND WE JUST ONE ALIGN OURSELVES. WITH THE COMMENTS INDICATED PART OF JUSTICE AND ALSO LEADERSHIP COUNCIL THAT YOU THINK THAT THIS DISPOSABLE PREMATURE AND ALSO WERE WORKING WITH ON THE AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH REGULATORY PROCESS AND IMPLEMENTING AB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE SPECIFICALLY IS PILED PROJECTS IN THE DATA OR CIRCLED. FOR THOSE REASONS PROPOSED. BACK CLUB AND STEAM WITH SMUD -- SIMILAR TO SENIOR WAY WE HAD OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION OUR REVIEWING WERE REVIEWING THE NEW AMENDMENTS THAT WE GOT TODAY THINKING. REBECCA MARKETS REPRESENTING FOOD AND WATER WATCH OPPOSED. GOOD EVENING JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY WHICH HAS CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATED AGAINST INVESTMENT OBJECT GRF DOLLARS FOR DAIRY DIE JESTERS OWING TO THEIR INEFFICIENCY. LOCALIZE POLLUTION ISSUES AND BIAS SCALE FACTORY DAIRIES WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL IN REQUEST YOU KNOW VOTE. KYLE JUSTICE HERE WHO CALIFORNIA ALSO OPPOSED AFTER THE REASONS. MENTIONED BY OUR MINDS JUSTICE FRIENDS THANK YOU. SHE CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN WHITE BUT THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL WERE OPPOSED TO LESS AMENDED BECAUSE THE BILL NARROWS THE A DEFINITION OF RENEWABLE GAS THAT WAS CONCLUDED IN SP THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH WE WORKED ON RENEWABLE HYDROGEN NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED. IN. A PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S CLEANER UP AND THEN THE OTHER USES HAVE WE WE WOULD HOPE TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT. CAME UP ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER AUTHORITY WE CURRENTLY HAVE OPPOSE POSITION THE BELL ALIGNER COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF MUNICIPAL UTILITY CESSATION. IN THE QUARTER FOR THE I THINK YOU. GOOD EVENING SIR TO HARRY WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY. AT GOING THE COMMENTS OF MY PUBLIC ON PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY COLLEAGUES I'M ARE CURRENTLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BUT LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS AND RECONSIDER OPPOSITION IF NEEDED. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE AS EGGMAN [inaudible] IS IT BUT LET'S YEAH ARE YOU ACCEPTING THE MINUTES. MOVE THE BILL. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS IS A QUESTION I DON'T TO BRING ALL THE WITNESSES BACK THAT BUT BOTTOM SAID. I OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED IS YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDERSTANDING THE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT YOU AGREE TO TO WORK OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE. I WAS IN THE UTILIZING COMMERCE ME DOES THAT. IN YOUR EYES ADDRESS. THE MAJORITY BUT LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ISSUES WERE STRUGGLING THROUGH ON THIS BILL IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF GAS IT'S GOING TO BE USED. WITHIN THE GAS PIPELINES OR A CERTAIN LEVEL OF QUALITY OF GAS. THE NEEDS TO BE USED -- WE CAN JUST PUT ANY KIND OF GAS IN THERE OTHERWISE IT WOULD DAMAGE. YOU KNOW STOVES AND ANYTHING THAT BURNS ON NATURAL GAS SO. SOME PEOPLE DON'T PRODUCE NATURAL GAS AT THAT QUALITY. THEY WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. AND THERE YOU KNOW I THINK. IT'S IMPORTANT I I I THINK IF IF. THEIR ARE SOME PEOPLE STILL HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO CLEAN GLASS CAST AT THAT LEVEL BUT I I BELIEVE. THAT IF. IF THIS BILL. HAS HAS A REQUIREMENT TO PICTURE THE GASES IS CLEAN. AND AN EFFECTIVE AND AND USEFUL. WITHIN THE THE YOU KNOW THEY'RE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN DIFFERENT STATES. AND SO -- BUT CALIFORNIA HAS ITS SEPARATE REQUIREMENTS AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. THAT HAS BEEN WORKED ON BY. BY DIFFERENT -- COMMISSIONS THAT. REGULATE WHAT THAT NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO BURN SURE YOU KNOW THAT'S A PRACTICAL ISSUE ON ON THAT FISCAL ISSUE THAT WE HEARD FROM THE HON AND THIS WILL UTILITIES AND I MIGHT LOCAL HERE HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE A FOR EFFORT WE HAVE NOT MEDICARE LOOKED AT HER FOR MY TASTES AS AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL COST ADDING COST CONTAINMENT TO THIS BILL VERY IMPORT? VERY IMPORTANT POP FOR ME IT IT'S GOT A IT'S GOT A FIT WITHIN A CERTAIN. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T BLOW UP OUR OUR OUR RATES YOU CAN'T -- AFFECT COSTS IN A WAY THAT ARE RATEPAYERS BUT AND AND THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S AN AREA WHERE WE CAN START BUILD OUT. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T. THEIR CIRCLE ABLE YOU START A BUSINESS THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF A YOU KNOW OF OF INVESTMENT YOU NEED TO MAKE. THE GONNA MAKE A CERTAIN EXPENDITURE TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS. THIS IS THE ONLY THE ONLY BUSINESS THAT FROM DAY ONE WE'RE GONNA START REALIZING I RETURNED WE'RE GONNA GET CLEANER AIR WE'RE GONNA START -- EQUESTRIAN -- THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WE'RE GONNA START. CREATING JOBS. BUT THE YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WANT. THE ENTIRE -- SYSTEM TO BE PAID FOR BY RATE PAYERS AND HOPEFULLY WE STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE TO MAKE SURE WE WE HAVE A COMP COMBAT COMBINATION INVESTMENT DOLLARS. AND AND REPAIR DOLLARS. BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN WE CAN'T WE CAN'T THEM LIKE WE DID WITH ENERGY WOULD NOW WE HAVE. YOU KNOW WHEN POWER THIS REALLY CHEAP SOLAR POWER THAT'S REALLY CHEAP THAT THAT STARTED WITH THE ANNOYING AND INJECTION OF OF INVESTMENT. WE WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN HERE. IF IF IT WASN'T FOR THE STATE CREATING A MANDATE IN THAT AND AND REQUIRING BECAUSE CERTAIN. RATE PAID DOLLARS TO BE PUT TOWARD THE TASK WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. WE'RE NEVER GONNA ACCOMPLISH BRING IN BIO METHANE ONLINE WITHOUT A PROGRAM. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ON ITS OWN. THE MARKET ALONE CANNOT MAKE IT HAPPEN. AT BUT WE WILL BE CREATING RIBBON RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IN STATE CREATING THOSE JOBS AND STATE ANDIT'S A HE AND AND THERE'S A VALUE TO IT I WANT TO STRIKE. THAT. MEDIUM. THAT. THAT THAT MEDIAN THAT THAT CREATES THE JOBS GETS THE PROGRAM STARTED AND PUTS IT ON A PATH TO BEING. VERY AFFORDABLE CHEAP GAS IN THE FUTURE. BUT YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE AND WAIT. FOR THE PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THEMSELVES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS HAS BEEN -- EXPECTED AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM WE NEED THIS BILL THIS YEAR WE CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER YEAR. TWO YEARS FROM NOW -- CAR HAS HAS REQUESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACT ON A PROGRAM TO GET STARTED ON THIS WE HAVE. THIS IN THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT ARE WORKING SOME OBTAINED SIMULTANEOUSLY THE BOTH. NECESSARY THE BOTH IMPORTANT BUT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. FOR THAT WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS IN THIS AREA THANK YOU [inaudible] THERE ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR MR HUESO THANK YOU.

SEEM TO BE PILING ON I DIDN'T ONE QUESTION THOUGH BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WHILE I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS GONNA HELP US MEET OUR THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE GOALS -- THERE WAS ONE THING AT WORK WAS IT ALWAYS YOUR INTENT TO HAVE THIS -- THERE ARE CERTAIN SECTION SEE HERE ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT. YOU'RE ACCEPTING IS THAT RIGHT WHEN I HEARD OKAY THIRTY DONE OKAY. SORRY. I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A BIT OF THIS BLUNDER SEAT SAYS -- EACH GAS CORPORATION UP IF UP HERE'S A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF A TOTAL OF THIRTY TWO BILLION CUBIC FEET ABOUT NOTHING ANNUALLY -- BY JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY THIRTY SUPPOSED TO UNTIL ALSO WAS ALWAYS THIS IS IMPACT PERPETUITY. NOT A SUNSET IS THAT. RIGHT CORRECT OKAY RIGHT. NOW IT'S JUST A DRAFTING ERROR ALRIGHT HE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE [inaudible] SAYS MELENDEZ.

COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH SUCH COUNCIL THEY ARE ISSUING AN OFFICIAL OPINION I'M ON THE SUBJECT AND THEY THEY DO THINK THAT WE ARE IN THE CLEAR ON THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR FOR ASKING THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT TELL US CENTER WEST SO I THIS THE SECOND TIME THAT -- HAVE HAD A CHANCE.

TO ADDRESS THE UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS THAT ARE MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS. I THIS IS A SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TOXIC WASTE. THAT PUTS OUR BEACHES OCEANS INLAND WATERWAYS. I JOKES ARE LANDFILLS LEADERS ARE COMMUNITIES BY PHASING OUT NON RECYCLABLE TAKE OUT FOOD CONTAINERS AT STATE PARKS BEACHES. AND OTHER STATE FACILITIES. THE BILL REQUIRES CALLOUS EICHEL TO DEVELOP A LIST OF FOOD CONTAINERS THAT ARE RECYCLABLE AND THEN THOSE VENDORS WISHING THAT CONTRACT. WITH THE STATE WOULD ONLY USE THOSE TESTING ALL PRODUCTS OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALREADY PASSED SOME FORM OF LOCAL MEASURE. AIMED AT REDUCING WASTE. FROM THE FOOD SECTOR. AND HAVING THE STATE ALSO TAKE ACTION WILL SPUR THE MARKET FOR ALTERNATIVE PACKAGING AND DRIVE DOWN THE COST FOR EVERYONE. WHO ONE DO THE RIGHT THING? WHO'S A BILL. SINGLE USER WHO CATERS ADMITTED ONE URBAN LITTER. HAVE WE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA I CAN TALK MORE ABOUT IT WE HAVE FOUND HOLLY MARTINEZ WITH THE CONFERENCE THE PARKS FOUNDATION MCMURRAY FROM CONFERENCE AGAINST WAY SPEEDS FOR THE BILL. AND HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. HIGH AND HIGH MARTINEZ OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION OUR FOUNDATION IS A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS -- MANY OF OUR PARK PARTNERS AND WORKS TO PROTECT AND ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY STATE PARKS -- ARE PART ARE CALIFORNIANS -- USE OUR PARKS TO RELAX AND WHY AND ENJOY THE NATURAL SPLENDOR OF OUR BEACHES MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS AND OUR PARKS ARE PLACES THAT NEED TO BE PRESERVED SAID THAT CALIFORNIANS OF TODAY AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.

OUR STATE PARKS AS AN ECONOMIC ENGINE AS WELL AS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO ENJOY THANK YOU NICK. SHARE MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THIS IS A A POLICY THAT WILL ONLY APPLY TO FOOD SERVICE ON STATE FACILITIES -- DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED THIS VERY SAME POLICY FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES. THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD TO COVER THE ENTIRE STATE MULTIPLE TIMES THIS COMMITTEE IS PASSED IT TO COVER THE ENTIRE STATE -- WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ULTIMATELY PASSING THAT LEGISLATION. AND THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT TO ALLOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MODEL THE KIND OF SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING WORLD. THAT WE THINK. CAN ULTIMATELY BE ADOPTED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. STATE FACILITIES WILL BE INCURRING THIS COST THAT EVEN PLAYING FIELD OF OF ENTITIES THAT ARE PROVIDING FOOD SERVICE AT STATE FACILITIES OF THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA HAVE TO BEAR THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING IT. IF THERE IS SUCH A COSTS. ON THIS IS THAT WE CAN WE CAN DO IT THAT WAY WE CAN TRY -- TO CONTINUE THE PATCHWORK OF DOZENS AND DOZENS OF LOCAL ORDINANCES BASED ON THIS. THIS IS A AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND HAVE A UNIFORM WAY AND INVOLVING THE STATE IN DOING THIS. BUT PREVIOUS OBJECTION TO THIS BILL HAD BEEN FROM THE THE PACKAGING MANUFACTURES WAS. WE HAVE NO IDEA WE'RE WE'RE ASKING CAL RECYCLE TO DO LIST WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF PACKAGING WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN THIS IS IMPLEMENTED [inaudible] THIS LEGISLATION OPPOSES. STAR A STARTING POINT OF PAPER PACKAGING P. T. PACKAGING SOME OTHER SPECIFIC PACKAGING THAT WE KNOW TO BE TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE NOW THE OPPOSITION IS OBJECTING TO US PUTTING THAT. PARTICULAR LIST IN THE BILL SO AGAIN WE PUT THE SPECIFIC LIST IN THE BILL AS A STARTING POINT BECAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS OBJECTIONS NOW THEY'RE OBJECTING TO THAT -- YOU KNOW HONESTLY WE GO EITHER WAY THEY JUST NEED TO TELL US WHICH PART THEY'RE KNOCKING OBJECT TO URGENT AYE VOTE ON THE MEASURE.

OUT THE OUT SAID OTHER PACKAGING MATERIALS THAT ARE ACCEPTED -- IN RECYCLING PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE -- WOULD BE SHUT OUT -- AT THE OUTSET AND SOME OF THOSE MATERIALS -- I THINK ARGUABLY DEMONSTRATE HAVE A A LIGHTER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT AND OTHER MATERIALS -- AND THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT SO IN OUR VIEW AT A MINIMUM THE BILL SHOULD -- BE MATERIAL NEUTRAL AT THE OUTSET AND NOT ARBITRARILY CHAIRMAN THOSE PRODUCTS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE A AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT THERE ARE SOME OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT WE FEEL ARE VAGUE -- ANY CLARIFICATION OF THE BILL REQUIRES CAL RECYCLE IN DETERMINING A WHAT PRODUCTS ARE ADDED TO THE LIST -- TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THE PACKAGES PRONE -- TO BECOME LEADER OF VERSES ANOTHER PACKAGE BUT THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SORT OF INSIGHT AND HOW THAT'S TERMINATION WOULD BE MADE -- OTHER PROVISIONS THE BILL -- CHARGE CAO RECYCLED DOING SINCE AND ASSESSMENT OF CHEMICALS THAT MAY BE USED IN CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT WE THINK THERE ARE A REGULATORY DUPLICATION ISSUES HERE. AT THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUCH OVERSIGHT OVER CHEMICALS USING CONSUMER PRODUCTS THEY RECENTLY HAD FOOD PACKAGING TO THEIR WORK PRIORITY PRODUCT WORK PLAN. UNDER THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM --% SO DIRECTING CALPERS. AB -- WHERE WE DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE A THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE -- AS WELL AS THE DUPLICATION THAT WITH DTS SEE -- IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL SHOULD BE DELETED OF FROM THE BILL WE HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATION WASN'T BROWN'S OFFICE OF LAST WEEK ABOUT A MORE SIMPLIFIED APPROACH LOOKING AT A MATERIALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY COLLECTED -- AND IN IN RECYCLING PRO ENCOMPASSING PROGRAMS IN THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS BEING THE STARTING POINT -- WE'VE SEEN AS A KID HAVING A CONTINUE CONVERSATION ON THAT REGARD. AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY I HAD TO COME TO THE TABLE EARLY THIS YEAR AND SUPPORTING US. SIMBOLOS A PROPOSAL -- TO FIND -- INCREASE RECYCLING PROGRAMS UPPER POLY STYRENE CONTAINERS A COUPLE WITH THAT AND SOME ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE WE THINK THERE'S A BETTER APPROACH -- THAT BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE OPT YOU TALKED SENATOR ALLEN ON ON THIS ISSUE THE BILL BEFORE THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING KITTY HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SB THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE CAO RECYCLE TO CREATE A LIST OF APPROVED TYPES OF FOOD SERVICE PACKAGING. SERIOUS GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF RECYCLABLE COMPOSTABLE USE AND GOVERNMENT MANDATES BUT WE LIKE THESE TO BE MATERIAL NEUTRONS. SB THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE LIMITS THE MATERIALS THAT POWER CYCLE CAN CONSIDER AT THE OUTSIDE. THEN DIRECTS THEM TO COME UP WITH THE FAVORITE LIST OF PRODUCTS. BUT IF BUT HAS NO DIRECTION OF HOW POWER CYCLE WILL WILL DETERMINE ULTIMATELY WHAT IS APPROVED OR NOT. FOR EXAMPLE CAO RECYCLE MUST MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT A PACKAGE IS PRONE TO BECOME LETTER PURSES ANOTHER PACKAGE. THE BILL HAS NO CRITERIA ON HOW THAT DETERMINATION WILL BE MADE. THE RESULT FOR SMALLER INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS LIKE MANY OF OUR MEMBERS IS THAT WE WILL FACE A VERY UNPREDICTABLE VOLATILE PACKAGING MARKET WITH LIMITED CHOICE ULTIMATELY DRIVING UP COSTS. WELL THIS ONE SINGLE ISSUE. ALONE BY ITSELF WILL NOT DO THAT THE ISSUE TAKEN INTO THE LARGER CONTEXT OF THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF WHAT THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IS FACING STATEWIDE IS PROBLEMATIC. UNPRECEDENTED WAGE HIKES MANY WHICH ARE YET TO COME IS MINIMUM WAGE IS SET TO INCREASE. RELATIVELY NEW PAID SICK LEAVE REQUIREMENTS COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACA INCREASING WORKERS COMPENSATION PREMIUMS AND THE RESTAURANT PAIN. MASSIVE BILLS TO OFFSET A DEFICIT THEY DID COULD NOT CREATE TO THE STATE'S DIED AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND. ALL OF THESE COSTS ADD UP FOR OUR MEMBERS. STATE FACILITIES OFTEN ARE THE CHOICE OF LOCAL INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY LIKE THE ONES HERE IN THIS FACILITY. TO DO BUSINESS PLEASE DON'T CREATE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO THOSE INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS. SERIOUS COMMITTED TO THE ISSUE OF RESPECTABILITY AND COMPOSED ABILITY WE HIGHLY INVESTED IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOWS AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY ONE WHICH AN AXE FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS A PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS TO INVEST IN A STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR JUST THE SOLE PURPOSE A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY THAT DOESN'T PREJUDGE OUTCOMES AND FURTHER COMMITS THE STATE TO RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING. WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR MR LOW'S EFFORTS AS THAT BILL FOR MOVEMENT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD INTO NEXT ACTION. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO TODAY ON SB. THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PRESSMAN YANNI ON BEHALF OF WESTERN PLASTICS THE ASSOCIATION OF PLASTICS RECYCLERS IMPACT OF CORPORATION. HAVE WE UNDERSTAND THEM LAUDABLE GOALS OF THE SPONSOR OF THE AUTHOR AND ECHOING SOME OF MISTER SHAW SIX COMMENTS CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.

THANK YOU SEAN THOSE OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE STATE ALSO POST. ADEQUATELY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. SCOTT WHAT YOU'RE BETH IBEW LOCAL ELEVEN LOS ANGELES UP. JONATHAN CHOI WERE DARK CONTAINER CORPORATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. ALRIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISS MELENDEZ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN DOES THIS BILL -- WOULD IT ALSO PROHIBITS ANY MOBILE -- FOOD. CONCESSIONAIRE OR NOT CONCESSIONAIRES BUT TRUCKS I GUESS YOU KNOW FROM USING THAT TYPE OF MATERIALS WITH A CONCESSIONAIRE ON STATE PROPERTY LET'S NOT TAKE SOMEBODY'S A CONCESSIONARY SEE PROPERTY THAT THEY CAN STILL USE IT. YEAH YEAH IT'S ONLY REALLY THOUGHT WHAT'S THE PROPERTY. AS OUR DOCUMENT I KNOW BUT YOU CAN HAVE IT SOMEONE ON STATE PROPERTY WHO'S NOT A CONCESSIONAIRE. BUT LIKE FOR INSTANCE I WAS JUST OUT A GRADUATION PARTY THIS WEEKEND DOWN AT A STEEP BEACH DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY -- IN THERE IF THEY HAD A TACO TRUCK THERE AND THE PLACE THAT THEY WERE USING THEIR WORD STYROFOAM PLATES SO WHAT EFFECT WHOEVER'S CONTRACTING WITH THE STATE TO YOU HAVE TO BE INVOLVED CONTACT WITH THE STATE. SO IF I HAVE A PARTY AT THE BEACH. AND I HIRE SOMEONE TO COME WITH THEIR TALK CHECK THE CAN USE. THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL AND NOT GET INTO ANY TROUBLE. I WOULD THINK YES YES YES. FOR THAT MATTER COULD LOOK HERE TO PULL YOU FOUND ONE NO NO I'M CLEAR HER HEAD. TO THE PARTIES THAT MAKE ME. I MEAN I JUST I I'VE. I'M JUST NOT A IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE FAIRLY CERTAIN BUT NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN NO I THINK. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HOUSE TO INVOLVE A CONTRACT WITH THE STATE WOULD STATE AGENCY. OKAY SO AND SO SO THAT IN THAT CASE IT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED. OKAY AND SO MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY JUST -- ONE QUESTION [inaudible] I'M JUST. I DON'T LIKE TO SEE THAT STUFF IN THE OPEN THE WATER EITHER -- BUT I'M JUST WONDERING. EVERY CITY CAN ENACT THEIR OWN ORDINANCES AND SAY YOU KNOW WE JUST DON'T WANT THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL -- BEING USED IN OUR CITY BECAUSE WE'RE SO CLOSE TO WATER WAY OR JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T LIKE IT EVERY CITY CAN DO THAT NOW. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS TO WHY WE WOULDN'T LEAVE THAT TO THE LOCAL LEVEL TO LET THEM DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY GIVEN THAT. THERE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE SO CLOSE TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS RATE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR MEETINGS TWICE A MONTH WHATEVER THEY COULD. WELL BUT YOU KNOW YOU. IT'S DIRECT ACCESS I'M A LITTLE MORE SO THAN US REPRESENTING FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHERE THEY CAN REALLY SAY THEY WERE I THINK THEY WOULD GET A GOOD IDEA OF GOSH THE COMMUNITY REALLY HATES THIS OR THEY REALLY LOVE IT. HERE'S THE THING WE'RE WE HAVE JURISDICTION OVER STATE PROPERTY SO WHEN WE ARE THE STATE. SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE FOCUSED THIS BILLS JUST FOCUS ON CITY BUT I DO SO. SO BECAUSE I WAS ASKING THIS QUESTION IF IF A CITY IN ACTS OF LOCAL ORDINANCE THAT PROHIBITS THIS THESE OF THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL. AND A STATE FACILITIES LOCATED WITHIN THAT CITY LIKE FOR INSTANCE IN MIND WE LAKE ELSINORE IT WAS IT THAT THE CAMPGROUND WAS RUN BY THE STATE FOR A TIME. YEAH YOU CAN THAT DOES THE CITY'S ORDINANCE COVER YOU KNOW ANYTHING WITHIN A BROWNSTONES HUESO. AND YOU KNOW THAT IF I THOUGHT FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER STATE PROPERTY. EVEN IF THEY'RE CITY IS. AT THE PARK THE STATE PARK IS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION -- WE'VE. MANY. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THESE VERY ORDINANCES HAVE RUN UP AGAINST THAT [inaudible] BARRIER [inaudible] TIM. YEAH RIGHT I WAS I WAS. UP. YEAH SO THAT THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO STEP IN AND IN THIS CASE. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT MANY CITIES ARE STEPPING UP AND AND WE APPLY THOSE EFFORTS A GREAT DEAL MISTER STONE. THANK YOU SIR FOR BRINGING THIS AYE AT I AM. AND WILL BE DISAPPOINTED THAT IT IS THIS LIMITED IS JUST A STATE FACILITIES BUT IT'S PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO START. AND IN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT THE CONCESSION AGREEMENTS. THAT TO BE HONEST ON STATE PARKS PROPERTY OR DOES DEPARTMENT STATE PROPERTY IS IS FAIRLY FORMAL IT IS DONE THROUGH A CONTRACT. FACT I I WORRY THAT OUR COLLEAGUE HAS BLOWN THE WHISTLE ON THE DESK WHO TOOK IT MIGHT'VE BEEN OPERATING ILLEGALLY IN WITHOUT PERMITS ON A STATE FACILITY. OR THEY TURNED OFF OPERATE ADJACENT TO A STATE FACILITY WHICH WOULD THEN BE LEGAL DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION. SO CITY IS NOT INTERFERE WITH THE STATE PROPERTY STATES KNOCKING INTERFERE WITH THE CITY PROPERTY SO THIS IS NOT UP TO THE LOCALS THIS IS UP TO US CENTER. FOR A STATE AGENCY TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE ENSURE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN MATERIALS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND NOT APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT POTENTIAL FOR HARM IN THE AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT WE SEE. IS GOOD MODELING ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE ARE NOW COMING TO STATE FACILITIES A COMING STATE PARKS. AND A LOT OF LEASES THE PARKS A MARRIED TO SPEND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY. ON ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION WHAT'S APPROPRIATE WHAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TRYING TO GET A LOT OF THESE MATERIALS OFF THE BEACHES. AND THE AMOUNT OF OF TIME AND AND SPENT ON CLEAN UPS. FOR THE EXACT KIND MATERIALS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE REALLY CAN BE EXTRAORDINARY SO FOR THE STATE'S TAKE SOME LEAVE FOR THE STATE TO SAY THESE ARE MATERIALS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S GREAT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO AND WOULD NOT AT ALL INFRINGE ON A LOCAL JURISDICTION OR THEIR ABILITY TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAP THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SEEING THE SUCCESS. ADDED ADJACENT STATE PARK WOULD ALSO STEP UP AND DO THESE KINDS OF BANDS WE WE'VE DONE THIS IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. FAIRLY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE AMOUNT OF LITTER AND OTHER MATERIALS THAT WE SEE PLASTICS SARAH OVER THINGS IN IN THE ENVIRONMENT HAS DECREASED DRAMATICALLY SO THESE KINDS ORDINANCES WORK. THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR RESTAURATEURS INVENTORS TO USE WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS AND THAT THEY OPERATE. JUST FINE IN IN THE COUNTY WITH THE THE BAN ON STYROFOAM AND AND THIS TYPE PACKAGING THAT THIS IS REALLY AIMED AT SO I THINK THIS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. WE CAN GET THIS TO THE LEGISLATURE THINK IT'S A GOOD MODEL AT THESE VERY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE TO TAKE THE STEPS I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT A BILL I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD. WELL. IT'S IT IT'S BEEN REYES WE'RE TRYING TO CLARIFY I'D LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION IF POSSIBLE CENTER ALLEN -- IT SAYS HERE. ME LET ME GO BACK WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT A FOOD SERVICES SOLELY LOCATED IN. STATE OWNED FACILITY. ACTING IS CONCESSIONAIRES STATE PROPERTY UNDER CONTRACT EMIT THIS THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S THIS IS A WAR. HERE SO IT IS LOCATED IN A STATE OF FACILITY AND I GUESS THE EXAMPLE WOULD FOLLOW THAT IF YOU RENT THE FACILITY FROM IF YOU HAVE A PERMIT TO BE THERE. AND YOU BRING ANOTHER VENDOR. FROM OUTSIDE HE WOULDN'T BE USING THE HAMBURGER STAND NECESSARILY FOR DOING A WEDDING OR SOME OTHER EVENT -- WHICH WE'VE ALL BEEN AT AND YOU BRING IN YOUR OWN VENDOR NOW THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS IT CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT IT SEEMS TO BE THAT IT'S IS AN OR AN ANYBODY ON THOSE STATE. FACILITIES THAT'S PROVIDING FOOD SERVICE [inaudible] INCLUDING THE FOOD TRUCK. THIS IS FOOD SERVICES LOCATED IN A STATE FACILITY. SO YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THERE IN THE FACILITY THERE THERE ARE THE RARE IN THE PARKING LOT UNDER PERMIT LIKE I HAVE THAT WE PRESENT BOTH LIKE UP THE PERMIT AGAIN. BROUGHT IN THE VENDOR TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE -- IT IT IT YEAH I AGREE THERE SENS ALTMAN HERE IT'D BE VERY EASILY. ENFORCED ON ON A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO. THAT THE PEOPLE WRITING AND US WOULD HAVE NO IDEA SO WE'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS THAT BOTH A PROCUREMENT PROCESS. TO GET WITH SOMETHING THEY DON'T NORMALLY USED AS A LOT OF AMBIGUITY IN THAT ONE STATEMENT ALONG I THINK I THINK. THAT IF YOU CAN CLARIFY YEAH I KNOW I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU. WHEN I KNOW OF THESE FROM MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA WHEN WHEN YOU GET YOU GET A PERMIT RIGHT TO TO OPERATE ON HAVE? MADE A PUBLIC FACILITY AND AS WE WOULD GIVE TO ONE OPPOSITE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE. AND AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALWAYS PERMIT CONDITIONS RIGHTS OF THEIR VARIOUS CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH. GETTING THAT PERMIT -- I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN DOESN'T I'M. YOU KNOW PROVIDE. BONTA PRESENT CLARITY ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR CASE AND I SUPPOSE LEASE AS IT'S WRITTEN THERE WOULD. PROBABLY HAVE TO THE TO THE STATE PARK. TO YOU KNOW TO TO TO DETERMINE. HOW IT WOULD READ THIS IN TERMS OF DRYING UP ITS PERMIT CONDITIONS LIST? WALT. IT WOULDN'T BE UP TO THE BUREAUCRACY TO COME UP WITH GUIDELINES IT'S IN THE BILL. SO WHILE IT'S A IT SAYS A FOOD SERVICE FACILITY LOCATED IN A STATE ON FACILITY I I THINK THAT. TYPICALLY OVER THINKING ABOUT AS A NOW FOR EXAMPLE I JUST OUTSIDE MARKET STATE BEACH THERE'S A THERE'S A CONTINUE THERE'S OF THE PIER RESTAURANT DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT THERE. YEAH. BUT I THINK I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT PRIMARILY AT YOUR INTENT BUT AND MIND A PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT IN THE LANGUAGE AND WHO KNOWS ABOUT YOUR YOUR ANSWER THE QUESTION I APPRECIATE YOU HAVE YOUR OKAY. THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT TO POINT OUT -- THE AMBIGUITY I'M CERTAINLY IF IT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT THE BILL I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT [inaudible] YEAH. IN ADDRESSING IN YOUR FAVOR. AND I APPRECIATE YEAH YEAH NO. ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ALLEN. FOR INTRODUCING GONNA. PLAY WHAT I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP TO ADDRESSING THE PLASTIC AND OTHER POLLUTION PROBLEMS AFTER NAY IS A REAL CRISIS SO I THINK. LIKE MRS JOAN INDICATE I THINK THIS IS A GOOD. GOOD BELT RICK YOU TO WHAT DATA I WOULD CLARIFICATION YOU WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL LESS COMMITTEE MINUTES UP EARLY. AND WE SAW A LITTLE MORE WORK TO DO WITH THE COMMITTEE THIS COUPLE AMBIGUITIES OR RENT A COUPLE AND QUIT LOOK COUPLE QUESTIONS ARE RAISED THE HOUSES WE WANT WHEN PEOPLE FROM THE STAFF TO GET THEM RESOLVED.

SHALL I EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA [inaudible] LIMON. LOW MOAN AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ REYES. VARIOUS AYE STONE. STONE I EIGHT ZERO BUT ALSO. I THINK YOU MEMBERS SECOND BILL FOUR YEARS THAT BE FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVENTY LOW EMISSIONS BUILDING TECHNOLOGY MARKET DEVELOPMENT ACT. BUILDINGS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT 25% THE STATE'S GREENBELT MISSIONS -- WE HAVE BOTH THE BUILDING SIDE INITIATIVE AS WELL AS A TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION INITIATIVE HERE A VERY UNIQUE COALITION OF OF DEVELOPERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS SO. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION AND VERY HOPEFULLY YOUR AYE VOTE -- WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO ALEX JACKSON TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BENEFITS FROM A RATE AND COST PERSPECTIVE BUT LET'S BE BRIEF IN HONOR OF THEIR THAT I THINK YOU SENATOR I THINK MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OUT JACKSON WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. PLEASE TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT WHICH WE VIEW AS AN EXTENSION OF THE SUCCESSFUL NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. PART OF THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHICH WAS INSTRUMENTAL. IN PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR BUILDERS TO INTERVENE AT A TIME WHEN OUR WE CAN GET THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK WITH OUR PUBLIC INVESTMENTS AT THE TIME AND DO CONSTRUCTION. HELPING THE COST OF THAT TECHNOLOGY DOWN IN STRIDE AS WIDESPREAD ADOPTION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO DO THE SAME NOW FOR CLEAN HE S. WHICH ARE -- REALLY THE NEXT FRONTIER FOR CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES. SPACE HEATING AND WATER HEATING ARE THE TWO LARGEST SOURCES OF EMISSIONS AND BUILDINGS. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE COST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE BUT WE FACE SOME OF THE SIMILAR BARRIERS THAT WE FACED WITH SOME OF OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES TEN YEARS AGO. CONTRACTORS ARE AWARE OF THEM RETAILERS ARE STOCKING THESE PRODUCTS. THIS BILL PROVIDES INCENTIVES -- NOT MANDATES TO GET US THERE IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND HAPPILY SOME OF THE EARLY RETURNS FROM CURRENT PROJECTS ARE DOING THESE VERY SAME. INTERVENTIONS ARE SHOWING UTILITY BILLS SAVINGS FOR BUILDING OCCUPANTS ARE WE HAVE EXPLICIT PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL TO GUIDE THAT SAME BEST PRACTICES MOVING FORWARD AND WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING MY NAME IS CHARLIECORR MANY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EFFICIENCY FIRST CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE NONPROFIT TRADE ORGANIZATION I REPRESENT ENERGY EFFICIENCY CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I JUST LIKE TO SAY THE COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS THAT THERE ARE CONTRACTORS ARE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK AND WORKING TOWARDS PROVIDING A LOW EMISSIONS. ECONOMY THE NUMBERS ARE SMALL THE NASCENT INDUSTRY AND IT NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED. ONE OF THE BARRIERS WE FACE IS LACK OF AWARENESS BY BOTH CONTRACTORS AND HOMEOWNERS THAT THERE IS AN ABILITY TO DO THIS. THE TECHNOLOGY IS HERE IT'S IT'S A PROVEN TECHNOLOGY THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS IN THE WAY TO DO IT -- THAT SAID THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE DUE TO DEMAND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT INCENTIVES ARE FOSTER GROWTH IN THE INDUSTRY SOMEBODY WAY THAT THE CSI PROGRAM WORK WITH SOLAR -- WE SAW THAT PROP UP INDUSTRY WHEN IT WAS STARTING OUT AS A YOUNG INDUSTRY AND MATURE. INTO COMPLETE MARKET TRANSFORMATION WE BELIEVE THE SAME THING CAN HAPPEN HERE -- WE SEE THAT INCENTIVE LOWER COSTS AND INCREASED CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATION AND ARE A VERIFIER TO HOMEOWNERS IT'S A LEGITIMATE CAUSE -- WE THINK THAT WE HAVE THE SITUATION THAT HERE WE CAN INCREASE -- THE THE MANUFACTURES WE SAW IT WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF SOME OF THE THE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE. MANUFACTURES HAD THE BILLY PROVIDE THEM BUT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DEMAND AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT. IF YOU CAN SHOW ENOUGH INTEREST STATE WE WILL PROVIDE THE PRODUCTS AND SEWER BEEN COURAGE IN THAT THAT WILL BE A CASE. HOW WE ALSO SEE THIS IS BILLY TO TRAIN CONTRACTORS AND GET THEM PARTICIPATE AND FINALLY WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS? SERVES TO BENEFIT THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST AS IT DOES ADDRESS LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WHICH WE THINK IS REALLY CRITICAL. AND I THINK IF YOUR TIME THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER SILVIO FOR OUR IMPACT THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS ARE WORK ON THIS IS ALWAYS NICE FEEL TO BE THE BUILDER SET UP HER NEXT AND RDCS JUST SAYING HEY ECHO ECHO THEIR COMMENTS ONLY THING. I WOULD ADD TO WHAT ALEX SAID YOU KNOW -- THIS IS THAT NEW SOLANO PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN BEING TRANSFORMATIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM COULD BE EQUALLY AS TRANSFORMATIVE SPECIALLY FOR ENTRY LEVEL FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS WHO ABSENT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS COULDN'T. A INVEST IN MAKING THEIR HOMES MORE COMFORTABLE MORE LIVABLE AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT I STRONGLY URGE AND I'VE. AND FOR THE WITNESSES SUPPORT VACLAV AND SEE NOT BE HAVE THE CENTER FOR STABLE ENERGY AND SMOTHERED SPORTS THE MARKET TRANSFORMATION ELEMENTS THE BILL THANK YOU. A CROWD JUST CIRCLE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THREE SEPARATE* ON BEHALF OF SERIES IN SUPPORT TO GO TO THE CALIFORNIA SLEEP TILL THESE ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE MARKET TRANSFORMATION PERSONALS THE BILL THINKING. ERICA MARTINEZ WITH EARTH JUSTICE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF VALERIE TRAIL OF LAJOS -- REALIZING THAT I AM THE ONLY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION BETWEEN YOU -- AND YOUR DINNER -- SO WANTED -- TO JUST NOTE THAT WE ARE OPPOSED WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD COVERS. AUTHOR AND I DO LIKE -- THE TESTIMONY ABOUT THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE NEW SOLAR HOMES -- PARTNERSHIP -- THE COUPLE THINGS THAT WE'VE ARTICULATED ARE OPPOSED LETTER ARE -- WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS OF VISION THAT THE BILL IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL -- BUT WE DO NOT THINK THAT I GAS CUSTOMERS SHOULD PAY FOR ON MANY OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT MOVE TO ELECTRIFICATION SO. MAYBE PERHAPS YOU KNOW JUST. THERE SHOULD BE A FIREWALL THERE THE AUTHOR'S LATEST AMENDMENTS THAT I I THINK ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS P. GENIES CONCERNED ABOUT ON DOUBLE DIPPING WITH -- EXISTING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS -- IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT THOMAS NOT QUITE YOU KNOW BUT WE ASKED WHICH IS -- NO TECHNOLOGY SHOULD OF TWO SUBSIDY PROGRAMS BUT WE APPRECIATE DEFINITELY ON THE DIRECTION. ON THAT'S GOING SO WE CAN HOPE TO CONTINUE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IMPROVE THE BELL WE KNOW IT'S DOUBLE REFERRED THINGS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM A NEW SOLAR HOUSE PARTNERSHIP SUCH AS A PROGRAM CAP KIND OF DEFINING AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE NEED -- LIMITING THE PROGRAM TO RESIDENTIAL BEING ABOUT THEIR SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY HOMES -- AND CREATING SOME SORT OF PROTECTION SO NO MATTER THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE APPROACH OF THE PROGRAM. IF -- ONLY INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY OF MONEY CUSTOMER MONEY IS GOING INTO FUND SOMETHING ONLY THOSE OF THE CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD -- BENEFIT -- THINGS OTHER THINGS -- TO THINK ABOUT AND THAT WE CAN MODEL OF THE NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. THINGS LIKE A DECLINING INCENTIVE MAYBE PERFORMANCE BASED INCENTIVES ALL OF THESE PROBABLY -- AS A TOPIC THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THE AUTHOR ON AND SPONSOR INDEFINITELY CONTINUE -- AS CROSSOVER IS WITH MANY OF THESE MEMBERS IN THE UTILITIES ALMOND ENERGY COMMITTEE THANK YOU. YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. QUESTION MR MCCARTY HOME AS RATES. I DO I DO IF. I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE AND ALSO -- THE WORD THAT DUE CONSIDERATION FOR THE LOW INCOME HOUSING. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE THOSE INCENTIVES ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING -- FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO HAVE AN INCENTIVE LIKE THIS WHICH IS OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THOSE WHO WILL PURCHASE -- I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU AND THE GOAL IS TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE AND ALL THE PILOTS WHO SEEN AT THEIR THE LOW INCOME SPACE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL SO. THAT'S THAT 30% CARVE OUT SET ASIDE IN THE IN THE VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THAT. MR MCCARTY THANK YOU JUST THAT WOULD BE A TECHNICAL ISSUE MISTER. STERN SO I I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER HERE THAT BUILDING HISTORY AS SAYS HER ANNOUNCES THE SECOND LEADING SOURCE THAT THAT GHG EMISSIONS AND SO. THIS AS THE COMMISSION HELPS CREATE LIKE A PROGRAM INITIATIVE AND THEN I'M I'M KIND OF CONFUSED SO. ASSUMING IS THERE THIS OBVIOUSLY THESE EFFORTS ARE ALWAYS FREE SO ARE WE LOOKING AT CAP TRIED DOLLARS OR A PARTNERSHIP WITH. WE UTILITIES SET TO HELP MAKE THIS. A PENCIL OUT. HOW WILL THAT PLAY OUT? IN THE END SO THE CURRENT INTENTION -- IS. TO IT'S BOTH THERE'S A THERE'S A UTILITIES CURRENTLY BUY ALLOWANCES FROM -- FROM THE AIRPORT AND CONSIGNED THEM BACK TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR RATE PAYER BENEFITS SAID THERE'S BOTH NATURAL GAS UTILITIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THAT PART IT'S A SORT OF A SUBSECTION OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S ONLY THE UTILITY. CHUNK OF THE ALLOWANCE -- MARKET. AND IT'S LOOKING AT BOTH THE NATURAL GAS SIDE IN THE ELECTRIC SIDE CURRENTLY I THINK 15% OF THE ELECTRIC SIDE. OF FUNDS THAT ARE COLLECTED GO GO TO PROGRAMS AND I JUST A DIVIDEND BACK. RIGHT BUT BUT CURRENTLY THE NATURAL GAS DOLLARS ARE SORT OF JUST. SITTING THERE AND THAT IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING IS LEGISLATURE THEY'LL GO BACK AS A STRAIGHT DIVIDEND I THINK THAT'S THE ANTICIPATED FOCUS WE'RE INTERESTED IN CARVING OUT A SMALL PIECE OF THAT. DESERT OF ADVANCE THE MARKET ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SO DIRT THAT'S THE LANE WERE LOOKING TO PLAY WITHIN. AND AND WE ARE VERY TO TIPPY GINNY'S CONCERN WE'RE VERY OPEN TO THE IDEA OF A PROGRAM CAP OR SOME WAY TO CONSTRAIN THIS BECAUSE I DON'T. THE INTENTION HERE IS NOT TO GO SUCK UP ALL THOSE FUNDS WITHIN THAT CONSIGNED ALLOWANCE REVENUE IT'S IT'S DESERTED TAKE WHAT THE ELECTRIC MODEL IS AND AND LOOK AT IT ON BOTH THE GAS AND ELECTRIC SIDE. OKAY [inaudible] ALRIGHT. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SEEING NONE. SENATOR WOULD LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION AND HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THIS WEEK AND GOING THROUGH ENERGY TO WILL. WILL RESOLVE SOME OF THOSE OUTSTANDING ISSUES I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT I'M I'M VERY OPEN TO TO SOME OF THE PROPOSALS PUT FORTH BY THE OPPOSITION LIKE I SAID IT ABOUT PROGRAM CAP AND ALSO BORROWING FROM MINUTES AND HAS.
