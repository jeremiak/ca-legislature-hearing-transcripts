OUR TROOP ON RAMP INTO CAREERS WHICH COULD INCLUDE CONTINUED WORK THROUGH THE COOP WELL WORKERS HAVE PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS. AND SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS HAVE DONE IT COULD MEAN INVESTMENT INTO A POSITION AT THE CORPORATION SO. WHENEVER FIRST GRADUATE AND UP GETTING UP A ROLL THAT INTO IT OR IT COULD ULTIMATELY MEAN- BECOMING AN ENTREPRENEUR AND LAUNCHING THEIR OWN BUSINESS. THE GREAT THING ABOUT WORKERS COBB IS THAT THEY DO OFFER THAT EXPANDED ACCESS TO WORK BASED LEARNING WHILE ALSO OFFERING JOB QUALITY BENEFITS THAT INCLUDE HEALTH BENEFITS.

MENTIONED WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM. DID YOU KNOW THAT THEIR- I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS PERMISSIBLE. AND IMPORTANT POINT THIS BILL IS JUST TO SAY THAT- THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM. FURTHER CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA SPENT ONE POINT 5% OF THESE FEDERAL FUNDS ON TRANSITIONAL PLUMMET. D. C. W. D. B. WHICH IS A MEMBER OF FOR SEVEN YEARS A RECENT INCREASE ALLOWABLE PERCENTAGE OF FEDERAL WORK FORCE DOLLARS. THAT COULD BE SPENT ON TRANSITION PLANNING FROM 10% TO THIRTY PERCENT.

SCHEDULES WELL- SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT WOULD PLACE AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD OUR PURPOSE FOR TO SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT WHICH OPERATES IN MY DISTRICT. CURRENTLY MOST PUBLIC EMPLOYEES DO FALL UNDER PURPOSE JURISDICTION. FOR RESOLUTION PLAYER EMPLOYEE CONFLICTS HOWEVER MOST TRANSIT DISTRICTS HOW REMAIN UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE COURT SYSTEM DUE TO HISTORICAL PRECEDENT. SO TO RESOLVE A CONFLICT BETWEEN SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT ONE SIMPLY ORGANIZATIONS A WRIT MUST BE FILED IN SUPERIOR COURT BUT ONE OF THE INVOLVED PARTIES. THIS EXISTING PROCESS IS TIME CONSUMING EXPENSIVE MAY ACTUALLY PLACE AN UNFAIR PRACTICE CHARGE WITH THE JUDGE WITH LITTLE OR NO EXPERIENCE WITH EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS. IN COMPARISON THE PURPLE CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROCESS TO STREAMLINE. STREAMLINED LESS EXPENSIVE FOR EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS A TAXPAYERS IN PARTICULAR TO CONFLICT RESOLUTION WITHIN PUBLIC SECTORS.

THIS PROCESS CAN TAKE YEARS TO GET A JUDGMENT AND THIS COULD BE FROM A JUDGE THAT ME OR MAY NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN LABOR LAW. THIS IS ALSO A COSTLY PROCESS WHERE THE TAXPAYERS ARE THE ONES THAT ULTIMATELY PICK UP THE TAB. THIS BILL CHANGES THAT BY POLICE AFFECT MY REGIONAL TRIP THE WORKERS UNDER PREPARE RESTRICTION. THIS IS A COST EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY WAY THE SOLVING POORLY EMPLOYEE RELATIONS. IT ENSURES THAT BOTH THE EMPLOYER. AND EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH. IT LIMITS INTERFERENCE WITH EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION RIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME IT PROTECTS THE EMPLOYEES FROM BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. FOR LACK OF FAIR REPRESENTATION BY THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY BELONG TO. THIS WILL CREATE UNIFORMITY WITHIN THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE TRANSIT EMPLOYEES ARE PART OF A LARGER GROUP OF PUBLIC WORKERS.

I'M JUST VERY PROUD OF THE PEOPLE-SACRAMENTO AND WE TRY TO WORK TO SOLVE PROBLEMS HEY YOU'RE TURNED OUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

THANK YOU CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR. THANK YOU. BECAUSE LIKE A GOOD IDEA AS LONG AS YOU SEE SIX FEET APART FROM. ANYONE WAS TO UTICA. FOR THE FOR DISCUSS BILL YES MEMBERS. I HAD A- AND IT'S REGARDS TO THE SEAS WERE. READ IT. INTO THE ABILITY FOR THIS AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO- ADDRESS THESE ADDITIONAL CASES IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND BEING THAT I'M VISITING ON SEVERAL BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS I'M A FRESHMAN SENATOR I'M LEARNING ABOUT ALL THESE AGENCIES AND THE BACKLOG THAT MOST OF THESE AGENCIES HAVE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS- CASES I AM UNDER THE IMPRESSION AND I AM. SORRY ABOUT SEVENTY OTHERS INJURED CURRENCY- IS IT HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONCERN WITH THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM- AB OR PRICES THESE THESE CASES BECAUSE IT'S- AND I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF ON THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT- THE NUMBER OF BACKLOG CASES THAT THEY HAVE AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVED IN THE PAST IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT WE ARE THE RIGHT NOW AND- WITH RESPECT TO THAT. SO WELL APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY IS A FORMER CHAIR OF. THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC PAYMENT- COMMITTEE RETIREMENT COMMITTEE AS WELL. THERE HAS ONLY WE'VE DEALT WITH SOME BACKLOGS OVER AT- PER AND- WE BUT I SHOULD BE WORKING TO ADDRESS THOSE- BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS THE COURTS SYSTEMS EVEN MORE BACKED UP. AND EFFECT EVEN MORE COSTLY SO- CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW WE CAN TRY TO BETTER IMPROVE- IN TERMS OF SUPPORT FUNDING FOR PURPOSE TO MOVE THINGS MORE QUICKLY THROUGH PURPOSE. BUT PURPOSE CERTAINLY A MUCH SUPERIOR WAY OF RESOLVING THESE DISPUTES THEN GOING TO THE COURTS AND THAT THAT'S WHY BOTH MANAGEMENT AND LABOR BOTH- AT IN SAC ARE. AND THE LEBANESE REPRESENT TO PLEASE BOTH ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. OKAY SO THEIR ARMS SO THEY THEY DON'T MIND TAKING ON THESE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THEIR BACK I MEAN WHERE ARE THEY RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS THE BACKLOG ARE STILL AT LEAST A PRETTY BACK. BUT AGAIN I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE- GOING TO THE COURT SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE COSTLY AND LESS TIMELY. ABSOLUTE GREEN FOR OF SYSTEM SO- SO WELL I DO RECOGNIZE THAT- THERE HAVE BEEN BACK UPS AT PER BUT THEY'RE NOWHERE NEAR WHAT. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WITH THE COURT SYSTEM AS WELL AS AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER IN MY TESTIMONY. PURPOSE DESIGNED TO HANDLE THESE DISPUTES THE JUDGES. ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE LABOR LAW IF YOU GO TO THE COURT SYSTEM- YOU MADE END UP WITH THAT. NOW THE JUDGE MAY NOT HAVE THAT FAMILIARITY AND SO IT'S A MORAL. NO PROLONGED- BUT CONSTRUCTIVE PROCESS SOMETIMES AT AND GOING TO THE PUB SYSTEM SO THAT'S WHY BOTH MANAGEMENT AND LABOR- WANT TO. DO IS. USE THE PURPOSE SYSTEM IS THE WAY TO RESOLVE THEIR DISPUTES AND THAT'S IMPRESSIVE I ACTUALLY COMMEND AGREE WITH SENATOR LEARNED ON THAT ENDEAVOR I WAS JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO THE STATUS AS THE BACKLOG- PORTION OF. OF THE OF THE AGENCY IN FOR THEY WERE AS FAR AS RESOLVING THAT ISSUE. I WOULD HAVE TO SINCE IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE CHAIRED THE SENATE COMMITTEE I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO STAFF OR OTHER PEOPLE AS TO WHAT THE EXACT STATUS OF THE- PROBATE. COURT SYSTEM IS AT THIS POINT TIME. IT IS TO- SO MAKING IT BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYONE PRESENT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. BUT WE DO NOT. HE TURNED BACK TO THE ONE OF THE LEAD WITNESSES IF INDEED THEY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION BUT ABSENT THAT- HI. YES THEY DO IN FOR SOCIAL CARE TERRY BURN ABOUT HALF OF THIS YEAR YOU CALIFORNIA. I WOULD SAY YOU'RE RIGHT HISTORICALLY THE PER BOARD WAS BACKLOGGED IT WAS UNDERFUNDED FOR YEARS UNDERSTAFFED. IS MATTER OF FACT IT NEVER HAD A FULL CONTINGENT OF PER BOARD MEMBERS- IT FOR YEARS THERE WERE ONLY THREE AND SOMETIMES FOUR MEMBERS. THAT HAS BEEN RESOLVED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IN THIS LEGISLATURE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. THEY'RE FULLY FUNDED FULLY STAFFED THE BACKLOG IS DIMINISH DRAMATICALLY- THOSE CASES THAT EXIST NOW THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. OUR COMPLEX CASES NOT. A TICKET TO A PROBLEM WITH COMPLEXITY AND NOT STAFFING AND NOT BE A- NUMBER OF CASES COMING FORWARD. THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS WHEN WE DID AB TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY LAST YEAR. THE BUDGET AMOUNT WHAT IS THE COST IN THE- PROBATE- APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WITH NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT WAS JUST TO DRAFT THE REGULATIONS THEY HAD PLENTY OF STAFF AND TIME. TO ACCOMMODATE ONE OF THE LARGEST AGENCIES IN THE STATE. SO I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A FURTHER BACKLOG OR ANYMORE- MUCH MORE WORK FOR A VERY EXPERTISE AGENCY AT THIS POINT. OKAY THEN I DID FIND HERE THE. INFORMATION I WAS SIGNED SAID- THEY IN OUR TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG WAS ONE FOR FIVE MILLION- AS FAR AS THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND- BUDGET. AND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ONE POINT TWO MILLION I'M GOING AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY BUDGET TO CONTINUE REDUCING THIS BACKLOG I WAS JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THE STATUS WAS ON ON THAT ENDEAVOR- OKAY SO BASICALLY WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING IS THAT RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T FOR SEE AN ISSUE WITH THEM CARRYING ON INTERNATIONAL CASES THEY HAVE TO STOP AND THEY HAVE THE FUNDING THE ONGOING FUNDING THAT THEY WILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE EFFICIENT THAT'S INTO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PER BOARD ACTUALLY HANDLES LABOR DISPUTES ACROSS PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IS THAT THE MAIN EXCEPTION HAS BEEN TRANSIT AUTHORITIES AND GIVEN THE SIZE OF SAC RT I DON'T THINK THAT. WE'RE GONNA BE ADDING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE WORKLOAD OF THE PER BOARD THAT THEY ARE READY- DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF ALL THE DIFFERENT PUBLIC EMPLOYEE- UNITS A DAY OF UNIONS THAT THEY DEAL WITH. OKAY WELL I HAVE NO PROBLEM SUPPORTING IT IF I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AGENCY IS ABLE TO HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD WITHOUT CARRYING IT. YOU KNOW IN PUTTING IT BACK INTO A HUGE BACKLOG WHERE- AS I'VE LEARNED THROUGH OTHER AGENCIES IN OUR BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. IT JUST BECOMES- YOU KNOW JUST. BUT SIX MONTHS INTO BEING ABLE TO PROCESS SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. THANK YOU TO. GET ANYTHING ELSE FROM A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE CENTER PANEL QUESTION I HAVE IS WITH REGARD TO AMENDMENTS- BUT- YOU TAKE ME AMENDMENTS- ON THIS ITEM. OF NO NO MEMBERS ON THE SIDE OF I DON'T BELIEVE ANY AT THE MOMENT SO COULD. THE REQUESTED FROM THE COMMITTEE.

WORKERS COMPENSATION AND THE RIGHT TO JOIN A UNION. DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS HAVE ALSO BEEN EXCLUDED FROM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SICK DAYS AND BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS AS SIMPLE AS PP. EVEN THOUGH MISS CLASSIFICATION IS ILLEGAL IT IS OFTEN CHEAPER FOR TRUCK COMPANIES TO SETTLE WAGE CLAIMS FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR THAT. TO PROVIDE THEIR WORKERS WITH THE PROTECTIONS AND PAY THAT THEY DESERVE. SB THREE THREE EIGHT ADDRESSES ITS ONGOING PROBLEM BY BUILDING OFF OF EXISTING LAW. SB FORTINO TO. MOURN TRUCKING COMPANIES THAT WALK AWAY FROM UNPAID CLAIMS GET ADDED TO A JOINT LIABILITY BAD ACTOR LIST THE EXISTING LAW HAS BEEN IMPORTANT IN STOPPING BAD ACTORS FROM WALKING AWAY FROM AND PAYING. FROM PAINT- FROM UNPAID WAGE CLAIMS EXCUSE ME BUT IT DOES NOT PROTECT WORKERS HEALTH AND SAFETY OR ADDRESS SYSTEMIC MIS CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS. SB THREE THREE EIGHT ALSO ADDRESSES THE FAILINGS AND PROTECTS WORKERS HEALTH AND SAFETY BY ADDING TRUCKING COMPANIES TO THIS LIST IF THEY GET A FINAL HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATION FROM CAL OSHA. OR ANOTHER STATE OR LOCAL ENTITY. THE BILL ALSO READ OUT SYSTEMIC BAD PRACTICES BY ADDING PRIOR OFFENDER TRUCKING COMPANIES TO THE BAD ACTOR LIST AS WELL.

GAP BETWEEN THE COMPANY THE WEALTH IS BEING CREATED. AND ALL OF THESE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF. TRUCK DRIVERS WHO CAN'T EVEN GET THE BASICS I HAVE A BILL- RELATED TO THIS IN THE SENSE OF HOW MISS CLASSIFICATION. DENIES THESE TRUCK DRIVERS THE ABILITY TO COLLECT UNEMPLOYMENT.

THAT **** BORDER AND I DON'T HAVE A LOOK AT A SINGLE SESSION AN ESQUIRE IS THAT OUT OF A HIGH HE COULD NOT MUCH. COMMENT I DO WE HAD THAT WAS IN THIS BY YOUR THE ME BUT I WITH- COMPLAIN THAT ANOTHER LOS AND ONE OF THE- SOON AS WELL AS AS DISTINCT COOPER WHO THE MIDDLE. BUT THE EXPECTED SA I STAY I STASHED GOT MORE LOOKING JUST BE DONE EAT THAT FATAL. WITH THEM HAVE BEEN A LOT IT IS A HUNDRED THIRTY E. THE COURT BUT- AND CONDO I INFILL SITE LOOK AT THE MOST IN. AND WENT UP IT'LL MASK THAT OKAY WE HAVE PLAYED WITH THAT. I'M I'M KIND OF CURIOUS- NOW HE AS FAR AS THE- I AND I'M DISAPPOINTED THE CAN THAT I HAVE WHEN YOU JUST SEE pFORGIVE ME I AM NOT VERY ELOQUENT ON THE AND. I'M CAN ABOUT THE- ABILITY TO PUT COMPANIES IN THIS LIST THAT CREATES BEFORE HAVING THEIR DUE PROCESS- COMING FORTH SO. BASICALLY YOU'RE FOUND GUILTY BEFORE- BEFORE BEING PROVEN GUILTY IN IN IN IN. N. IN ESSENCE AND THE COULD YOU ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS I MEAN YOUR YOUR POINT OF. YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON ON THAT CONCERN THAT I HAVE THAT WE ARE PUTTING COMPANIES. ON THESE LISTS- WITHOUT HAVING A DUE PROCESS BASICALLY SAYING OKAY YOU'RE GUILTY BEFORE PROVEN IN I MEAN DURING YEAH YOU'RE GUILTY BEFORE PROVEN. GUILTY ON THAT END. AT THANK YOU- SENATOR CHOI BOOK I APPRECIATE THAT- THE QUESTION AND SO THE WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES SO NUMBER ONE IT EXPANDS BAD ACTORS. THE BAD ACTORS LIST THAT CURRENTLY- IS IN PLAY RIGHT NOW THROUGH- THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT WHICH BASICALLY STATES THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD IF YOU'VE BEEN AGREE JUST EMPLOYER NOT PAYING WAGES TO- DO THAT MISS CLASSIFICATION. YOU'RE CURRENTLY ON THAT LIST THIS BILL EXPANDS THAT TO INCLUDE ON TOP OF THE UNPAID WAGES TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY IS ALSO A FACTOR ESPECIALLY WITH COVERED NINETEEN MANY OF THESE WORKERS ARE NOT RECEIVING SOMETHING SIMPLE AS PP. THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING OUR UN SANITIZED THERE BE ANOTHER TOUCHING AND SANITIZED A PLACES THEY STILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY COMPANY POLICIES YET STILL DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF GETTING A WAGES THAT ARE PAID. AND ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS SO THE DUE PROCESS PART I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THEY- GETTING ON THAT LIST ON THE UNPAID WAGES SIDE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE APPEAL PROCESS FIRST SO THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE APPEAL AND THEY'RE STILL. NOT PAYING HIS WAGES BACK THIS AGAIN JUST EXPAND THAT TO ENSURE THAT IF THEY'RE DOING THAT WHILE ALSO VIOLATING HEALTH AND SAFETY THEY NEED TO BE ON THAT LIST AND OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SUBTLE. BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TO THE LIST SO THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE ON THE CALIFORNIA SIDE IS REALLY NOT A FULL LIST FOR A LOT OF ACTORS THAT ARE JUST NOT- THAT ARE JUST KIND OF. MISSING IN THE GAPS BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT- THEY'RE JUST PAYING THEM YOU KNOW SETTLEMENTS AND THEY'RE NOT. ABLE O BE ON THE LIST SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE CAPTURING BOTH SIDES THE WAGE SIDE BUT ALSO. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT THEY'RE BEING THEY'RE SETTLING WHAT DOES THAT. MEAN WHAT EXACTLY DOES NOT. YOU'RE JUST PAYING OUT. OF WORKERS EITHER IN THE- OR- THEY'RE JUST NOT PAYING AT ALL.

I THINK EARNS. ME POLITICS SENATOR ALSO IT HAS TO MAKE THEM SIR CORRECT. THANK. FOR IN MOTIONS MADE PRODUCT. OUR WE'RE GONNA ASK FOR RULE VOTE ON THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY SENATOR COURTESY BY SENATOR CORTEZ THE AYE SENATOR- CHOKE NO SENATOR- CHAU POKE NO SENATOR ALSO. SAN GARAGE SO I SAY LET. SENATORS ICE NEWMAN ALL RIGHT SENATOR NEWMAN HI THAT BILL IS FOR TO ONE. THREE TWO BILLS. THANK YOU SOON. THANK YOU. SENATOR HERTZBERG K. THOUGHT I SAW YOU STILL INTO THE ROOM OR HERE HERE. THERE IS. A YOU MAY PRESENT TO YOUR BILL AS. FIVE TWO. WITH YEAH. GERMAN MEMBERS. S. WE IN OUR- AS CHALLENGES EVERY DAY. AS WE LEARN AND GROW GET BETTER. I UNDERSTAND WHAT PARTS OF GOVERNMENT WORK AND DON'T WORK IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. TO ADOPT IMPROVEMENTS. CURRENTLY WE HAVE THE- STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THAT STATEMENT DEPARTMENT OF LABOR HAS A PROCESS- THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S BUREAU OF FIELD ENFORCEMENT NOTICE BOTH FEES RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS AND ISSUING CITATIONS TO BAD ACTORS. THE BAD ACTORS AND SO THE PROCESS IS YOU REALLY GET INTO THE DETAILS IS SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING BECAUSE ONCE THERE'S A FINAL JUDGMENT ONCE INVESTIGATIONS COMPLETED ONCE EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF AND YOU'VE GOT A FINAL JUDGMENT JUST LIKE IN ANY OTHER CIVIL PROCEEDING WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GO COLLECT ON THE JUDGMENT. ONE OF THE PROCEDURES THAT WE ALWAYS USE IN THE LAW IN CIVIL PROCEDURES IS TO. PASSAGE SUPERIOR COURT FOR AN ABSTRACT OF JUDGMENT WE GET THE ABSTRACT OF JUDGMENT RECORD THE JUDGMENT ON A LIEN AGAINST THE REAL PROPERTY WAS CHAIRMAN ENTRY WHERE OF THAT YOUR BUSINESS EXPERIENCE. IN LIFE. AND THE PROBLEM IS WITH WITH THE ABSTRACT OF JUDGMENT PROCESS IS OFTEN SLOW. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS WE'VE CREATED A CERTIFICATE OF LIEN. SO THAT RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO THE COURTS IS OVER AGAIN THERE'S A FINAL JUDGMENT. WE'VE CREATED CERTIFICATE PROCESS. AND THAT CERTIFICATE OFF PROCESS UNDER THIS LEGISLATION IS TO BE THAN ACCEPTED TO BE RECORDED. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A RELEASE PROVISION IF THAT MATTERS PAID. BUT WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS WE'VE SEEN PART IT'S JUST SMART GOVERNMENT WE LEARN WE GROW AND WE GET BETTER AND WE LEARN HOW TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESS SEES. SECOND PIECES THAT SOME OF THESE BAD ACTORS BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG. TO ONCE THE FINAL JUDGMENT IS OBTAINED TO BE ABLE TO THEN. GET ABSTRACT THEY THEN TRANSFER THE PROPERTY PRIVATE TIME TO TRANSFER THE TITLE BYRON TIME TO THE RECORDATION OF THE ABSTRACT. AND SO THE SPEED IS CRITICAL ONCE A FINAL JUDGMENT IS OBTAINED. AGAIN THIS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL THE CHANGE PROCESS IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT ENFORCEMENT. AND COLLECTIONS. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE GOVERNMENT WHICH SEES THAT WE HAVE A BAD ACTOR ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED CASES LAST YEAR. EVEN THOUGH IT COBIT. ADD TO MAKE THE PROCESS MORE INTELLIGENT- SO THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE'VE INTRODUCED IT- AND I WE HAVE- RENEE. A FROM THE SEIU- I IT ALSO FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE THERE'S CATHERINE LEóN.

FOR ANY SIGN THE JOB OF WELL OF COURSE FOR CLARITY PURPOSES- WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLE. ENTITIES ARE OWNERS FOR A CORPORATION IS THE R. THAT MEANS IS THE AMOUNT DIVIDED AMONGST ALL ALL THE- THE INTERESTED PARTIES ARE THE OWNERS ARE THEY IS IT TOO IS IT THE SAME AMOUNT FOR EVERY OWNER HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT WORK IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE JUDGE IN THIS THIS IS REALLY A POST JUDGMENT REMEDY. TO COLLECT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO WHERE THERE'S BEEN A FULL DUE PROCESS AND THEY'VE% BEEN AWARDED JUDGMENT AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY COLLECT IF THE JUDGMENT SAYS JOINED SEVERAL THEN. THERE'S FIVE DEFENDANTS THEY'RE ALL LIABLE ONE PERSON HAS THE MONEY IT'S PAID AND THEY HAVE TO SUE AMONGST EACH OTHER OFTEN THESE JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY CLEAR AS TO WHO THE DEFENDANT IS IN THE CASE WHO IS THE GREEN PARTY AND MAKE THAT CLEAR THOSE ARGUMENTS OFTEN IN THE CASE WHEN THERE'S FULL DUE PROCESS. THAT THE EMPLOYERS WILL THEN ENGAGE IN AND SAY WELL I DIDN'T REALLY DO IT IT WAS THE RASO WHO DID IT. OKAY WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. IT'S SO SIMPLE WELL IT OR COULD BE LAYERED WHO DID IT BUT THE POINT THAT'S INTERNAL FIGHT BUFFALO HUNTS THAT HAPPENS THEN THEN THE JUDGMENT SO IT'S A FUNCTION OF WHAT THE JUDGMENT SAYS THIS IS JUST SIMPLY A WAY. TO AVOID THE SCAMMER RENO'S THE CAR BECAUSE THE PROCESS TAKES SO LONG ME THINK HOW THAT THAT WORKS RIGHT I MEAN THE GOVERNMENT IS OUT THERE SOMEBODY'S ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED AS A PROBLEM AND WE HAVE A PROCESS IS SO INEFFICIENT THAT WE LET SOMEBODY- BASICALLY SKIP OUT FROM UNDER THE LEAN ON THEIR PROPERTY- AND MAKE IT WORSE THAT'S REALLY WILL ROUTE WILL ONLY DO WITH BAD ACTORS. IN RELIGION WITH INTELLIGENT PROCESS TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER AND NOT HAVE THE DELAYS BY RECORDING ABSTRACT OF JUDGMENT. WE COME UP THIS IDEA OF CERTIFICATE OF LIEN. HEY THERE'S A RELEASE A LEAN. RELEASES THE- BILLION AGAINST PROPERTIES YOU KNOW IN REAL ESTATE THAT WAY IT WORKS. YEAH AT THE END OF PROCESSES I'M GETTING SOON PRETTY SPEEDS ARE GOING TO BE VERY. DIFFICULT OR THE TEACHERS TO. TELL OUR HOPE IS I MEAN THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL. WE'RE TRYING TO. BRING SOME CMMON SENSE TO AVOID THIS EMBARRASSING PROSPECT. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE HAD. ONE THOUSAND ONE SEVENTY TWO CASES. AND TO TRY TO SPEED IT UP AND MAKE IT SIMPLER LESS COSTLY LESS DIFFICULT AND MORE EFFECTIVE ONCE THERE'S BEEN A FULL AND FINAL HEARING. AND THE PERSON IS DETERMINED TO BE LIABLE AND THIS IS JUST THE COLLECTION EFFORT AND MAKE IT WORK JUST LIKE. ANY OF US WOULD WANT. ONCE A JUDGE'S BEEN OBTAINED. FOR COLLECTION PROCESS TO OCCUR EFFICIENTLY SO ONCE AGAIN JUST FROM REGULAR PROGRAM UNDERSTANDING WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLE. OWNERS RIGHT. IS THE R. R. IT IS A JUDGE. EQUAL AMONGST IS IT I. EQUAL AMONGST EACH EACH ENTITY INVOLVED OR IS IT DIVIDED AMONGST MULTIPLE OWNERS OF THE BUSINESS OR MULTIPLE BUSINESS AND REAL ESTATE. BUSINESS AS WHOEVER DID THIS IS AGAINST. A BUSINESS OWNER RIGHT WHO DOESN'T PAY THEIR WAGES IF THERE'S MULTIPLE BUSINESS OWNERS YEAH- ARE THE- ARE THE M. IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. DIVIDED AMONGST THE BE THE OWNERS OF THE COMPANY OR IS IT FILED WITH ONE AMOUNT SAY THEY OWE A THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A DIVIDED AMONGST FOUR WITH A NO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS EACH OR IS IT A THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU NEED TO WHOEVER PAYS THAT. OURSELVES A PROPERTY FIRST AND PAYS UP TO LEAN GET EVERYBODY OFF RIGHT. THAT'S THE CONCEPT THE JOINT SEVERAL LIABILITY THAT'S A CONCEPT THAT THE PART THE DEFENDANT'S LET'S ASSUME THAT THE PLAYERS WHO ENGAGED IN INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT AND GOT A JUDGMENT AGAINST THEM. THEY WILL ARGUE THAT BOTH MR HURD'S PERSONA MADE THE MISTAKE THE JUDGE AND SHOULD BE AGAINST HIM. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. ALL THING THIS IS TO DEAL WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF WHAT EVER THE ORDER SAYS. THE ORDER SAYS JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY AMONG THREE OWNERS. THAT MEANS THAT WHOEVER PAYS FIRST IT'S PAID OFF AND THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE HAVE TO GO AFTER THAT THAT PERSON IS GONNA BE THE TWO PEOPLE FOR THEIR SHARE. OR MOST LIKELY THERE'S CLARITY IN THE PROCESS. SO THAT THE ORDER. GOT THESE DAYS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ORDERS WILL INDICATE WHO'S LIABLE. AND THEN THE LEANS AGAINST THE PROPERTY. THANK YOU THEY OF COURSE OF COURSE THANK YOU. OKAY SEE AN ORDER REQUEST TO BE RECOGNISED HER FROM THE DAIS THE CENTERS FOR NOW YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I JUST AS RELIABLE THEY GET I THINK THE QUESTION A CLEARANCE IT'S JUST A TRYING TO MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE ONLY GOING% AFTER BAD ACTORS AND IS A FULL AND FINAL HEARING OF THE PROCESS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT SIMPLER MORE INTELLIGENT.

ALL RIGHT I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD SENATE BILL FIVE TWENTY THREE EXPANDS AND MODERNIZES BIRTH CONTROL ACCESS AND ENSURES GREATER CONTRACEPTIVE EQUITY STATEWIDE REGARDLESS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S GENDER OR INSURANCE COVERAGE STATUS. DESPITE THE PROGRESS MADE IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH DISPARITIES IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES PERSIST AMONG BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR INCLUDING DISPROPORTIONATE UNINTENDED PREGNANCIES INFANT EMR TED MORE MATERNAL MORTALITY AND S. T. D. RATES. IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO MODERNIZE AND EXPAND ITS CONTRACEPTIVE EQUITY LAWS TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO CONTRACEPTIVE CARE IMPROVE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CREATE GREATER HEALTH EQUITY. TO THAT END SB FIVE TWENTY THREE ACCOMPLISHES THE FOLLOWING MAKES CALIFORNIA'S CONTRACEPTIVE EQUALITY LAWS GENDER NEUTRAL. REQUIRES COVERAGE OF OVER THE COUNTER. I AGREE- REQUIRES COVERAGE OF OVER THE COUNTER BIRTH CONTROL OPTIONS TO INCREASE ACCESS IN TIME SENSITIVE CARE EXPANDS CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE BENEFITS TO STATE EMPLOYEES AND INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLANS. AND PROHIBITS EMPLOYER DISCRIMINATION BASED ON EMPLOYEES CONTRACEPTIVE CHOICES HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL R.

LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THANK ACCESS OF COAST. THE COVERAGE EQUITY ACT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH OFFENDED THE LABOR MENTIONED CODIFIED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S BIRTH CONTROL MANDATE INTO STATE LAW. CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST DATE COULD DO THIS AND THE MEASURE OF THE USE OF A MODEL LEGISLATION AND OTHER STATE. THEN OTHER STATES HAVE ENACTED PROVISIONS THAT WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE EIGHTEENTH BIRTH CONTROL MANDATE TO CREATE GREATER CONTRACEPTIVE EQUITY. FOR EXAMPLE WHILE WOMEN ENSURING CALIFORNIA CAN I OBTAIN STERILIZATION SERVICES WITH NO OUT OF POCKET COSTS. MEN STILL HAVE TO PAY COPAYS AND COST SHARING THEME PARK AFFECTING. AT THE TWENTY TWENTY AT LEAST EIGHT STATES NOW REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO COVER MALE STERILIZATION SERVICES WITH NO COPAYS. THE COSBY NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HALF BROTHER ELIMINATED THE STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT YOU. INCOME PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ACCESS. CONTROL SERVICES. A COURT REVEALED THAT FIVE OF LATINOS COMPARE 229% OF WHITE WOMEN NOW FACE DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING BIRTH CONTROL AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. SO WHAT X. COMING UP OVER THE COUNTER BIRTH CONTROL WILL OFFER HELP REDUCE BARRIERS TO CONTRACEPTIVE CARE FOR THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DURING COLD THE NINETEEN EMERGENCY AND BEYOND AND CREATE GREATER CONTRACEPTIVE EQUITY WHEN EXPANDING THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN AN ANNUAL SUPPLY OF CONTRACEPTIVES THIS IS THE BENEFIT NOW EXPORTED TO MANY BUT NOT ALL CALIFORNIANS. AFTER BIRTH CONTROL SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON YOUR INCOME INSURANCE STATUS OR WHERE YOU LIVE WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL OVER THE YEARS SEVERAL UC UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAVE SUBMITTED COMPLAINTS TO CENTRAL ACCESS BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF BIRTH CONTROL CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED IN THE KNOX KEEN HEALTHCARE PLAN ARE ABLE TO DO SO. ONE STUDENT REACHED OUT TO THE STUDENT HEALTH PLAN ADMINISTRATOR AND WAS NOTIFIED THAT BECAUSE THE PLAN ITSELF FUNDED THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA REQUIRING THIS COVERAGE WOW THIS IS CORRECT IT IS DEVASTATING FOR A STUDENT HERE AFTER YEARS OF ATTACK THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ARE SPEAK CAN AND MUST ADVANCE CORRECTIVE SOLUTION.

INDIVIDUAL COVERED UNDER THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR ARRANGEMENT MAY INCORRECTLY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE COVERED BY THE CARRIER ADMINISTERING THE BENEFIT AND THAT THEY HAVE THE PROTECTION OF STATE REGULATION. WHEN IN FACT THAT COVERAGE AND PROTECTION LEGALLY ARE MORE LIMITED. SELF FUNDED PLANS ARE NOT LEGALLY HEALTH INSURANCE FOR PURPOSES OF KNOX KEEN. THEY OPERATE LIKE THAT IN MANY WAYS. ASSEMBLY BEING LOCKED INTO YOUR PLAN FOR THE YEAR. IF A STATE EMPLOYEE AND A SELF FUNDED PLAN DISCOVERED THAT THE PLAN DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COVERAGE. FOR EXAMPLE IF A MAN FINDS THAT THE COST SHARING FOR AFFECTED ME IS WHAT YOU HIGH I CAN OFTEN BE A THOUSAND. YOU CANNOT JUST CHANGE PLAN. WE WILL NEED TO WAIT A YEAR AND THEN EXAMINE HIS. OPTIONS DURING THE NEXT OPEN ENROLLMENT. BUT NOW WE HAVE TO SWITCH PLAN TO GET. COME WE THINK IT MAKES. COVERAGE BASEBALL AND OFFICE PLANS.

I HOPE YOU'RE NICE AND KIND- SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL SIX FIVE SEVEN FIRST I WANT TO THANK THAT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE ENGAGE WITH ME IN THIS BILL IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME TOO THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THE ON THE BILL BEFORE IT IS HEARD IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IF IT PASSES THE COMMITTEE TODAY. I'M OPEN TO HEARING COMMENTS FROM ANY GROUP THAT HAS CONCERNS AND LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH EVERYONE I INTEND TO ADD CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO DEFINE SOME OF THE TERMS AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT BUSINESSES STILL NEED TO DO ALL OF THE CURRENT POSTINGS AT THE PLACE OF BUSINESSES. I ALSO INTEND TO REMOVE THE SECOND SECTION RELATED TO THE ELECTRONIC. SIGNATURE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN SB SIX FIVE SEVEN AUTHORIZES BUSINESSES WHO HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE WORKING FROM HOME OR TELECOMMUTING TO RECEIVE SPECIFIC EMPLOYMENT RELATED DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO ALL THE EMPLOYEES. WERE WORKING HOPE HOME FROM HOME RIGHT NOW AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC COVE IT HAS DISRUPTED BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FORCE MANY INDUSTRIES TO REWORK THE WAY THAT THEY OPERATE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE ORDERS FROM THE STATE. HOWEVER THERE ARE CERTAIN NOTIFICATIONS THAT EMPLOYEES MUST RECEIVE EACH YEAR AND THERE IS NO SET WAY FOR EMPLOYERS TO CONDUCT THAT BUSINESS AT THIS MOMENT. SB SIX FIVE SEVEN WILL ALLOW FOR EMPLOYEES THAT ARE WORKING FROM HOME OR TO A COMMUNITY TO RECEIVE SPECIFIC EMPLOYMENT RELATED DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE SAME INFORMATION. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE IN THE WORKPLACE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS ACTUALLY HOFFMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND JENNIFER SUPER LOCK WITH THE SAN DIEGO SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- WILL MOVE TO ASHLEY HOFFMAN THE FIRST IDENTIFIED LEAD SUPPORT BUSINESS HE MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE NECESSITY WILL OCCUR FIRST ABOUT OKAY. THAT WOULD BE FINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS JENNIFER HUBER LACK ON BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ALSO NOTED SAN DIEGO SHERMAN WE'RE ONE OF SIXTEEN CHAPTERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL OF SHERMAN WHOSE MEMBERSHIP CONSISTS OF MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND HR PROFESSIONAL. IN TURN CAL SHERMAN AFFILIATE OF THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOR SHARM WHICH IS THE FOREMOST EXPERT CONVENER AND THOUGHT LEADER ON ISSUES IMPACTING TODAY'S EVOLVING WORKPLACES WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HR AND BUSINESS EXECUTIVE MEMBERS AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE COUNTRIES. OUR MEMBERS TO SERVE AS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER TAX WITH APPLYING EMPLOYMENT LAWS ENACTED HERE IN A REAL WORLD CONTACT. IN THE PAST YEAR OUR MEMBERS HAVE STILL MORE REQUESTS THAN EVER FROM EMPLOYEES ASKING TO TELECOMMUTE. OUR EMPLOYEES WANT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR WORK ARRANGEMENTS AND MAXIMIZE TIME THAT WITH FAMILY MINIMIZE TIME SPENT ON THE ROAD. I CAN BALANCE WORK LIKE NEED. IN OUR MEMBERS WANT TO PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY WHILE STILL ENSURING OUR TEAMMATES ARE APPRISED OF THEIR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. UNDER SB SIX FIFTY SEVEN REMOTE EMPLOYEES WOULD NOT NEED TO GO INTO THE WORKPLACE. JUST TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS AND POSTING. NO WOULD THEY NEED TO. THEIR HOME WITH BURKE CULTURE. INSTEAD THEY CAN SIMPLY RECEIVED REQUIRED. ELECTRON SB SIX FIFTY SEVEN WOULD ALSO PROVIDE HR PROFESSIONALS WITH MUCH NEEDED CLARITY THAT ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION IN FACT COMPLIES WITH THE LAW. NOTABLY SB SIX FIFTY SEVEN DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY REQUIREMENT TO POST NOTICES IN THE WORKPLACE RATHER IT CREATES A NARROW COMMONSENSE RULE FOR REMOTE WORKERS ONLY. AND PERHAPS MORE NOTABLY THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME HAVE ALREADY CONFIRMED THE PROPRIETY OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF CRITICAL WORKPLACE NOTICES FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO PAYCHECK WE'VE UNDER SB NINETY FIVE SPECIFICALLY PERMITS ELECTRONIC ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION FOR REMOTE EMPLOYEES. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MMHM WHO WILL GO BACK TO ASHLEY HOFFMAN OF MISS HARPER DID YOU WISH TO SPEAK. I GUESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT SB SIXTY SEVEN. DOURADO OF CURVE IT IT THAT NEEDED THAT UP 240% OF CALIFORNIANS RECORD STARTED TELECOMMUTING ONE ISSUE EXASPERATED BY THAT TRANSITION WOULD HOW DO EMPLOYERS DISSEMINATE REQUIRED NOTICES THE TELECOMMUTERS. MANY POSTERS ISSUED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER DMCH REQUIRE THE POSTERS TO BE DISPLAYED IN A CONSPICUOUS PLACE UNEMPLOYED FREQUENT IN THE WORKPLACE. THE BOSTON PLAYERS WONDERING HOW TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS WERE COMPLAIN WHO'S NOW TELECOMMUTING IS NO LONGER FREQUENTING THE TYPICAL WORKPLACE INFANTS LEADING MOST OF THEIR TIME IF NOT ALL THEIR TIME AT HOME. WELCOME LAWS REGULATIONS EXPLICITLY SAY THAT ELECTRONIC NOTICES THE FISHING IN THE REGION OTHER RATHER SILENT ON THE ISSUE. BECAUSE THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ARE SILENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO NOTICE COMESTIBLE EMPLOYERS ARE NOW HAVING TO MAIL NOTICES THE TELECOMMUTING EMPLOYEES TO BE SAFE SO AS NOT TO INCREASE PENALTIES. BUT ONLY ABOUT PROFIT COSTLY BUT LOCAL WORKFORCE ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION THIS MEANS THAT SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE WERE HAVING TO RECEIVE A PACKET OF PAPER WHICH IS A STAGGERING AMOUNT OF PAPER THAT COULD EASILY BE PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY. SB SIX FIFTY SEVEN FOLLOWS THIS ISSUE INCREASED CONSISTENCY IN THE LAW BY PERMITTING ELECTRONIC NOTICE FOR ALL REQUIRED NOTICES FOR TELECOMMUTERS AND STATED THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT ALREADY PROVIDE FOR ELECTRONIC. ALTERNATIVES ONLY BE COMMISSIONER HAS ALREADY RECOGNIZED ELECTRONIC NOTICE BEING SUFFICIENT FOR PREGNANT I THINK THIS ABILITY LEAVE. MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK INFORMATION FOR WORKERS COMP CLAIMS AND SB NINETY FIVE NEW PAID SICK LEAVE REQUIREMENTS ELECTRONIC NOTICE MISCIBLE FOR THESE RIGHTS TO EMPLOYEES IT SHOULD BE FOR OTHER SIMILAR RIGHT WELL. AS STATED BY SHERMAN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS NOT TO ROONEY THANK YOU REQUIREMENTS BUT YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL LOCATION OPEN TO INFLUENCE THE POSTER REQUIREMENTS STILL EXIST. BUT ONLY DRESSES THE ISSUE OF WHEN YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES WHO DO NOT FREQUENT THE PHYSICAL WORKPLACE NO LIFESTYLE WHETHER YOU CAN SEND THEM. NOTICES AND. FREDDIE EASILY AT HOME AND THERE'S LESS RISK OF LOSING AN ELECTRONIC COPY THAN PHYSICAL ONE THAT MAIL TO THAT. THE TELECOMMUTING INCREASES IN TIME FOR THE LAST UNICORN ONLY ALLOW ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION ARE NOTICES AND POSTERS A PROCESS THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE RIVER COMMISSIONER IN MULTIPLE CIRCUMSTANCES- URGENT IVOTE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM AND ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX FIFTY SEVEN. LET'S SEE NONE WILL GO TO YOUR FULL ROOM. ASCENA WITNESSES ARE WISHING TO SPEAK WILL COME BACK TO THE MODERATOR OF THE TELECONFERENCE SERVICE- IN ASKING QUEUE UP ANY SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX FIFTY SEVEN.

ASK YOU TO CONFIRM THAT ON THE RECORD IT'S IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING THE COMMITTEE. TO DO TO INSTANCES SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS ON AMENDMENTS- TO MOVE TO. TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE ABSOLUTELY AS A MATTER OF FACT WE'VE HAD IT I'M GOING CONVERSATIONS TODAY THIS MORNING AND- UNFORTUNATELY THE OPPOSITION OR THE QUESTION OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT UPWERE. LATE LAST WEEK AND SO WITH THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND IT JUST MADE IT DIFFICULT TO GET EVERYTHING AND WRITING FIRE TO HAND BUT WE DID YOU SEE SOME OF OUR OF OUR MEN AND LANGUAGE- AS IT THIS WEEKEND AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I SPECIFIED IN MY OPENING REMARKS SOME OF THE TERMS AND I'M WILLING TO ADDRESS MOVING FORWARD. IF THE COMMITTEE ALLOWS ME TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FAILED BUT IN REALITY IT BUT IN YES I UNDERSTAND IT SO. SO IN SHORT- IN SHORT WOULD YOU BE SICK TODAY IS- IS A MOTION THE UNDER. THAT THE MAN OF THE MIDDLE. CURRENTLY ONGOING. THAT WOULD BE TAKEN UP IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. YES SO JUST GETTING THE FORMAL LANGUAGE- ON AND I HAVE NO. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO OBJECTIONS TO THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP AS AN TODAY. WE THINK THANK YOU- OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CENTER ALERT. IRMA CUT A FINER POINT ON THE CHAIRS QUESTION. HAVE THE AMENDMENTS NOT BEEN AGREED TO YET. THAT WE HAVE SO THEY WERE THEY WERE TWO SETS OF- CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THE FIRST SET OF CONCERNS THAT WE CAME OVER. AS OF LAST. FRIDAY I BELIEVE. HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING WE AGREED- TO ADD THAT THE CLARIFICATION LANGUAGE TO THE BILL. TODAY THERE WERE SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT. NOT CONCERNS BUT MORE CLARIFICATION PURPOSES- ON WHAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE SO. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE NO. JUST LOOKING FOR THE PROCESS NOT THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS RIGHT HAND SO. IT'S BASICALLY THERE WERE TWO. SETS OF CONCERNS FIRST ONE AMENDMENTS AGREED TO HIM THIS MORNING DID YOU AGREE TO AMENDMENTS ON THE SECOND YES THEY'RE JUST NOT IN PRINT YES AND- SO THERE IS AN AGREEMENT. ON AMENDMENTS AND- HI UNFORTUNATELY. THE DIDN'T ALLOW HIM GET TO THE AND- OF FROM THE LAW FED WHERE HE WAS TO SAY. WHATEVER THEIR P. WHILE AND SO DO YOU BELIEVE THEIR POSITION AS- THE DOG OF NEUTRAL WITH THE SECOND SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT YOU AGREED TO TODAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE QUITE WHAT THAT WILL DO TO THEIR STANCE. MISTER CHAIR WOULD IT BE OKAY TO GET CLARIFICATIONS FROM THE LEAK FROM THE WEEK- FROM THE SPEAKER. THE CENTER ALERT CENTER. I THINK YOU I THINK IF IT IS YOUR PREROGATIVE BUT I THINK IF. YOU AYE AYE AYE IT'S ROCKETS NOT FAIR TO ASK HER TO CHARACTERIZE THE OTHER POSITION FOR THE RECORD IT'S- NO BUT I A WELL WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IS IT'S NOT OUT OF ORDER FOR YOU TO QUESTION. A WITNESSES UNIVISION WILL KNOW SO I DON'T KNOW WE CAN AS A MODERATOR IF- IF THE WITNESS IS STILL AVAILABLE THROUGH THE TOLL CONFERENCE SERVICE IN IT I DON'T KNOW. BUT THAT SERVICE SITUATION- AVAILABLE FROM FAMILY PERFECT I WOULD ASK HIM A QUESTION IF THE MODERATOR CAN TELL US. MISTER MODERATOR. I NOT SHOW THAT THERE CURRENTLY ON THE CALL ANYMORE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR LET ME SAID. THIS IS. BY TEMPORARILY THE FLOOR. I AM A MEMBER OF THE TO DO. COMMITTEE AS WELL SO ARE. OUR OUR BELIEF THAT THERE'S BEEN GOOD FAITH CONVERSATIONS ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT MOVING ALONG. BUT OUR WALL. ACT ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY HERE TO REPRESENTED THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT. THAT IT WAS MOVED ON THE BASIS OF THESE AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO BE WORKED OUT. I DO HAVE AN EMAIL THAT I COULD. FORWARD T. RIGHT NOW OUR SHOW YOU I JUST THINK WE WERE WHERE WE ARE WE'RE GOOD WITH IT IS NOT WRITING ABOUT IN THAT POSITION I WOULD AGREE AMOUNT OF ASSURANCE AND EARLIER THAT- PROCESS. WE HAVE TO PROCESS OVER SUBSTANCE RIGHT NOW WOULD PROBABLY BE. IMPROPER TO TRY TO TAKE UP WITH AMENDMENTS ARE AN IMPRINT AT THIS TIME BUT I DO APPRECIATE- HONORED REPOSITORY. NO BECAUSE IF I FELT LIKE THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT. IN THE AGREEMENT CHANGED THE STANCE OF THE OPPOSITION. THE NIGHT GIVE ME EVEN MORE OF A COMFORT LEVEL THAN JUST HAVING TO WORK TO ENFORCE IT IN JUDICIARY. EITHER WAY. I THINK WE'RE GOOD. I WILL SAY AS THOSE THOSE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY I HAVE TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. THE REPRESENTATIONS RECEIVED FROM THE OPPOSITION- THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. HAVE BEEN THAT THERE IS AN OFFICIAL VERSION OF THIS BILL THAT THEY WILL SUPPORT AND THERE'S ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS TO GET THAT LANGUAGE AND DEPRESSED. THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW. S. AND I BELIEVE- AS MISTER CHAIR AT THAT THAT BELIEVE THE MISTER MITCHELL IS STILL AVAILABLE ONLINE. TWO SIX SIX. BUT I THINK IT POINT MISTER. RUBIO WORSE I DON'T THINK THE MARKET OKAY I DON'T THINK WAS A MOVIE OUR MORE ALL THE UNDERSTOOD STEP WE'VE HAD JUST THIS COME. OUR MOVE THE BILL BY. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AGAIN WITH YOUR THAT THE ON- NEGOTIATE ON AMENDMENTS- WILL BE TAKEN UP IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON THAT'S THAT'S THE MOTION AS AS I UNDERSTAND IT STRUCTURE YES YES. SENATOR NEWMAN I'M SORRY. AND I DO A PRE CENTER LIZARDS COMMITMENT TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF I HAVE. AND I PAUL I AM VERY SENSE AS TO THE SUBSTANCE OR EVEN THE CHEST- OF THOSE ISSUES WERE. AT THAT ARE SUBJECT TO AMENDMENT- MUCH LESS ONE AT. AT THE OPPOSITION IS WILLING TO ACCEPT THEM OR ACCEPT THE AUTHORS REPRESENTATION AT THE INCIRLIK TO OTHER MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE OR USE IT GIVING ME THE HANDS SO. THEN I'M FINE IT TALK ABOUT HIS BLIND ON THIS BILL AS I'VE BEEN ON ANYTHING A WHILE I'M SURE IT'S NOT IT'S. IT'S PROBABLY NOT MONUMENTAL. WOULD YOU WANT TO GO HOME NO YOU'RE NOT BLINDED. I WOULD NOT COP TO THAT. OKAY WHAT DO SO IT TOO TO THE AUTHORS SECTION RICH ABOUT IT IF YOU WOULD NOT. JUST IN BRIEF. WHAT IS THE GIST OF THOSE ISSUES WORSE THOSE ITEMS WERE STE WHICH- STILL ARE IF YOU. ENTER SUBJECT TO AMENDMENT DISCUSSION JUST SO I KNOW BEFORE I CAST A VOTE ABSOLUTELY SO ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THE THAT WAS RAISED TODAY WAS THE FACT THE OR- THE- MISUNDERSTANDING THAT. THIS WAS IN LIEU. THEY THEY WOULD RECEIVE DENTAL YOU WOULD RECEIVE ELECTRONIC NOTICES IN LIEU OF HAVING THEM POSTED IN IN. I EMPLOYERS OFFER FOR. PERSONAL SO WE JUST NEED TO ASK PERFECT LANGUAGE THIS IS NOT AND WILL OF THIS IS IN THAT. TO THE POSTINGS OF CURRENT LOSS- OR CURRENT DISCLOSURES SO- ALL THIS IS DOING JUST AND SO. THEY JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT IN WRITING- WITH THE INTENT OF THAT RECEIVING THESE- ELECTRONIC NOTICES. OKAY THAT AND IT'S THAT'S THE TO IT BECAUSE THE SEEMS RELATIVELY TRIVIAL. THIS SERVICE IS THAT MY COLLEAGUES UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AS A MEASURE THAT DOESN'T ASSURING COMPORT WITH THE ANALYSIS I'VE READ SUCH AS SENATOR US GOOD. SENATOR PLEASE. A I THINK SIR LEARN WHO GUN TO THE GIST OF WHAT WORK WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I DO THINK THAT THEY WERE VERY SERIOUS ISSUES AND I WAS NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT BASED ON WHAT THE ORIGINAL OF A PROPOSAL- BILL WAS- AND I'VE YOU KNOW IT TO SUBSTITUTE WAS ONE GREAT SUBSTITUTE LIKE TRONIC FOR A WORKPLACE WHERE JUSTIN AT TIME OF. UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHO'S GOING TO WORK REMOTE WHO'S GOING TO STAY HOME WITH YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO GO IN THERE'S ALL THOSE UNCERTAINTIES SO- YOU KNOW NO RELIABLE ACCESS TO- CONNECTIVITY EMAIL AND ITSELF I AM ALSO AT THIS POINT ARE READY TO SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THE COMMITMENT THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ON THESE ISSUES- AND I ALSO I'M ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID TWO BOATS HERE. TO ROADS HERE- AND I'M I'M SURE THE AUTHOR OF WILL ADDRESS THIS IN SUCH A WAY HOPEFULLY THAT RESOLVES IT AND THEN WE WILL DO THE FINAL VOTE SO BANK FINAL THING OF A CENTER NEWMAN AND I DO APOLOGIZE SIR SO THE ONE ISSUE- THAT THAT DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF A THEY CAME UP. MY READING WHAT THE CA. THAT AN EMPLOYEE MONITORING OF THE SELECTION COMMUNICATIONS WOULD BE VISIBLE TO THE EMPLOYER AND MIGHT SUBJECT THEM TO RETALIATION AND SO YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR HEAD YES SIX SENATOR OSCAR OF MY ONE OF MY CONCERNS RICHARD SHOWED IT DOWN YOU'RE NODDING YOUR HEAD NO CENTER SHOW ABOUT AUTHOR I'M SORRY I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR- CONCERN WHICH WAS RAISED IN THE ANNOUNCES THAT I READ WAS THAT AN EMPLOYEE WORKING FROM HOME. THAT WAS GETTING ELECTRONIC NOTICES AND THEN ACTING ON THEM MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO MONITORING BY THEIR EMPLOYER AND AS A RESULT MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO RETALIATION IF THE EMPLOYER WASN'T HAPPY WITH THE RESULT OF THOSE INTERACTIONS ARE THE INTERACTIONS AND FOLLIS. SAID IS THAT BEEN RAISED IN ANGER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OPPOSITE. SO THEIR WIVES BUT I THINK THEY WERE A MISS ON. AS TO. THE INTENT OR- FOR- THE NOTION THESE ARE THE NOTE THAT DMP WOULD POSE. IN THERE IN THEIR PLACE WORK THAT EMPLOYEES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO YOUR BE ABLE TO SEE IT WORK AND- IN ADDITION TO HAVING THEM POSTED. BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND HAVING THEM WORK TELECOMMUTING AND WORKING REMOTELY. THEY WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO OPT IN TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THESE NOTICES VIA EMAIL. SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT THERE'S NO SENSE OF INTIMIDATION OR IT'S JUST IT'S DISCLOSURE- OPPORTUNITY AN OPTION THAT EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO IN PERSON. TO THE WORKPLACE- IF THEY FEEL UNSAFE IN GOING TO DO SO IT'S JUST CREATING AN ADDITIONAL. DISCLOSURE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EMPLOYEES SO THAT THEY CAN BE SAFELY WORKING FROM HOME GETTING THE DISCLOSURES AT HOME AND THEY'RE NOT EXPOSED TO. POP TO HAZARDS BASICALLY ON THE OTHER THING THAT I FAILED TO MENTION EARLIER YOUR SD THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE- OUTLINE THAT I MENTIONED IN MY IN MY REMARKS MY OPENING REMARKS. WAS THE- THE ABILITY TO HAVE A WET SIGNATURE SO WE'RE ACTUALLY DELETING NOT- SO THAT THEY WILL NOT BE PART OF THE BILL THAT WAS ANOTHER CONCERN THAT THEY HAVE WHICH WHICH WE'VE AGREED TO REMOVE IT AND HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH DOING THAT ALL WE'RE DOING IS. JUST HOPEFULLY TO EMPOWER EMPLOYEES TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE DISCLOSURE WITHOUT SUCCUMBING TO ENVIRONMENTAL OR HEALTH HAZARDS. WHILE WE'RE- LOWER GOING. TO ALL OF THE SPENDING. RICHARD DOT NIGHT FREE SHOULD MY CALL. COMMITMENT ACT MY PRO MOVES FORWARD. BUT THERE IS A SINNER NO I'LL GIVE A TO BE A ONE X. IS YOU GET OPPOSE. ELECTRON ASSISTING FROM A POSTER THAT SAYS YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN IF YOU'VE BEEN SUBJECT TO SAY HARASSMENT. I AM BUT YOU'RE USING THE EMPLOYERS VIRTUAL NETWORK. AND AS A RESULT YOUR IP ADDRESSES USUALLY TRY SO THAT EMPLOYER COULD KNOW QUITE WELL WHO IT WAS WHO WAS ACTING UPON. THAT INFORMATION YOU WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE. ANONYMOUS IN YOUR PURSUIT OF REDRESS ORDINARY MEN STARTING THAT PROCESS. AND SO THAT'S A CONCERN THAT WAS ACTUALLY REYES AND ANALYSIS THAT I READ- AND SO IF YOU'LL GIVE THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU WORK THROUGH THAT I'M OKAY WITH IT BUT I DO THINK THAT'S EIGHT. EIGHT A SUBSTANTIAL CONCERN WE SHOULD BE. APPS I AS I SAID THIS IS ONLY FOR THE PROTECTION OF BOTH THE EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYERS. AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING I. BEEN ATTEMPTING TO ENGAGE WITH EVERYONE IN GOOD FAITH AND IN GOOD WELL THAT AS A- FRESHMAN SENATOR I'M TRYING TO MAKE THIS. AS AS AS EASY. VERY NON CONTROVERSIAL BILL AS WE CAN MOVING FORWARD.

WITHOUT ACTION. LABOR SHORTAGES LIKE YOU BECOME WORSE. IT RETIREMENT WAVE THAT IS EXPECTING IT INDUSTRY. ROUGHLY IN CALIFORNIA IS EIGHT FORTY FIVE OR OLDER. THAT MEANS THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WILL BE APPROACHING RETIREMENT. AGE WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY OTHER. RECRUITING WOMEN INTO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WOMEN ONLY MAKE UP NINE PERCENT. OF THE OVERALL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND THAT HAVE TO CHANGE. THE LABOR SHORTAGE COMBINED WITH CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING AND OTHER CONSTRUCTION INVESTMENT MEANS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED WOMEN TO JOIN THE INDUSTRY AND RISE THE RANKS WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE.
