THIS REPORT FOR LEGISLATIVE

FIXES. THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.278
CONSIDER PARTICULARLY AROUND

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:54.746
THE RAMPANT FRAUD IN THE

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.514

TO REACH AN AGENT. WE FOUND THE

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:09.633
SAME SITUATION- WHEN WE

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.502

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:17.975
DOWN TO ONE PERCENT. EVEN AFTER

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:20.110
THE GOVERNOR. BUT THE STRIKE

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.779
AND THEY HIRED ADDITIONAL STAFF

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:22.980
THE ONE TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:24.515
STAFF WORKING IN THE CALL

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.350
CENTER. THEIR PERFORMANCE

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:28.886
IMPROVED BUT NOT ENOUGH TO

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:30.387
REALLY SERVE CALIFORNIANS WELL.

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:32.223
PART OF THE PROBLEM- SIMILAR TO

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:34.592
ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED BACK IN

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:35.659
TWENTY ELEVEN TRAINING TOOK A

THEY WERE THINKING THEY WOULD

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.334
NEED NINE TO THIRTEEN MONTHS

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.268
THEY TRIED TO STREAMLINE IT

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.003
DOWN TO NINE MONTHS THAT'S

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.737
STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.505
TIME. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL GET

00:41:48.572 --> 00:41:50.407

HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEIR BENEFITS

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:01.518

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:24.942
THE FIRST TO KEY ISSUES- ARE

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.710
STRUGGLING TO PROCESS CLAIMS

PROCESS CLAIMS INCREASED

00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:55.773

BUT THEY STILL CONTINUE TO

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:29.139

00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:28.365
EFFECTIVE BUT THEY'RE IMPACTING

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:31.001
LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. ARE BY NO

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:32.102
FREEZING THEIR ACCOUNTS ARE

00:54:32.168 --> 00:54:33.837
STOPPING PAYMENTS TO THEM. THE

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:35.839
WE NEED TO DO THAT COST BENEFIT

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.140
ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE WHETHER

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:39.009
OR NOT. IT MAKES SENSE TO

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:40.677
CONTINUE TO USE THAT TOOL SO

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.112
THEY KNEW YOU NEED TO DO THAT

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:44.781
TYPE OF ANALYSIS UP THE TOOLS.

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:47.517
ON TO DETERMINE WHICH ONES ARE

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:49.419
MOST EFFECTIVE. SO THAT'S THE

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.154
TWO REPORTS A VERY HIGH LEVEL

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.522
WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO GET

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:54.257

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:03.500
THE NEXT THING I'M GONNA TALK

00:55:03.566 --> 00:55:05.168
ABOUT JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:06.936
IS THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.004
WE'VE MADE NOT ONLY TO THE

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.139
LEGISLATURE BUT WE HAVE A

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:10.874
VARIETY RECOMMENDATIONS WE MAY

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.209
T. D. THE LEGISLATIVE

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:14.544
RECOMMENDATIONS I'D LIKE TO GO

THROUGH THOSE- WHAT WE HAVE.

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:18.982
SUGGESTED THE LEGISLATURE DO IS

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:22.585
REQUIRE EDT TO DEVELOP A

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.354

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.563
LAST RECESSION IN 200-072-0008

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.432
TWO THOUSAND NINE. BUT WE'VE

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:36.733
GOT TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.202
THAT THAT CONSIDERS WE HAVE A

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:41.571
SURGEON CLAIMS HOW ARE WE GOING

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:42.772
TO ADDRESS THAT DO WE NEED TO

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:43.973
MODIFY ANYTHING IN OUR

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.109
PROCESSES. WE NEED TO PULL BACK

THOSE FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:56:11.434 --> 00:56:13.503
THAT WAS A KEY ISSUE AND WHAT

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:14.971
WE'RE SUGGESTING IT ONCE THE

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:16.840
LEGISLATURE HOPEFULLY GETS THAT

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:18.808
IN STATUTE EDT COMPLETES THAT

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.677
FIRST RECESSION PLAN WITHIN

00:56:25.815 --> 00:56:26.616
PARTICULAR STATUTE. THAT'S THE

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:28.585
APPROACH AND THEN ADAM. EVERY

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.253
THREE YEARS AFTER. THEY'VE

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.688
COMPLETED A RECESSION PLAN

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:33.423
LET'S REFRESH THAT PLAN MAKE

WITH RICK AGAIN REGARD STAFFING

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:40.897
PROCESSING CLAIMS ETCETERA.

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:42.365
THREE YEARS MAKES SENSE BECAUSE

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.267
AT BASED ON RESEARCH WE SAW.

00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:46.102
RECESSIONS OCCUR BETWEEN FIVE

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:48.371
AND SIX YEAR CYCLE SO EDT WILL

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:49.839

THE PRBLEMS. ANOTHER

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:57.500
LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION- IS

00:58:57.567 --> 00:59:00.103
RELATED TO CROSS MATCHING-

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:02.038
INCARCERATION DATA AGAINST A

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:03.673
CLAIMANT INFORMATION CLAIMS

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.775
DATA INFORMATION. AND WE'RE

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:07.110
SUGGESTING THE LEGISLATURE

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:08.878
REQUIRE OF THE EMPLOYMENT

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:10.413
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO DO

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.515
THAT ALSO REQUIRE. YOU KNOW

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.484
STATE ENTITIES LIKE CDC ARE AND

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:17.253
LOCAL ENTITIES TO COOPERATE AND

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.122
PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO EDT

00:59:19.188 --> 00:59:20.890
THAT PDP NEEDS TO DO THAT CROSS

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:22.692
MATCHING. THE REASON THAT'S

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:24.227
IMPORTANT TO BE IN STATUTE IS

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:27.230
WHEN EDT OUR WORK TRY TO WORK

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.465
IT WORK IT OUT WITH CDCR THIS

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:32.402
LAST YEAR- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:33.703
HAD TO GIVE SEIZE YOUR

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.204
PERMISSION TO PROVIDE THAT

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.073
INFORMATION TO EDT. WE THINK

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.308
THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE IT

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:40.043
CLEAR IN STATUTE THAT THIS

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.811
CROSS MATCHING IS EXPECTED AND

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:43.780
CDCR IS EXPECTED TO SHARE THAT.

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:45.081
THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:48.518
WITH EDT SO THEY CAN DO THAT

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:50.019
CROSS MATCHING- AND THEN THE

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:52.422
LAST TWO ISSUES ARE RELATED TO

00:59:52.488 --> 00:59:53.856
FRAUD. LEGISLATIVE

00:59:53.923 --> 00:59:56.125
RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRING EDT

00:59:56.192 --> 00:59:58.461
IT IT'S AND IT'S ANNUAL REPORT

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.096
IT SUBMITS AN ANNUAL REPORT TO

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:03.199
THE LEGISLATURE- ABOUT FRAUD IN

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.734
AND HOW MUCH IS DETECTED AT

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:08.304
CETERA. BUT WE WANT EDT TO.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.906
EXPLAIN AND INCLUDING THAT

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:12.308
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TOOLS THAT

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.310
THEY USE THE ANALYSIS OF THOSE

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:16.212
TOOLS WHICH ONES ARE MOST

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.613
EFFECTIVE WHICH ONES ARE THEY

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.215
GOING TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.850
WHICH ONES ARE THEY GOING TO.

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.452
YOU KNOW NO LONGER USE BECAUSE

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:23.553
THEY'RE MORE OF AN IMPEDIMENT

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:26.055
DOWN THEN AFTER DETERRENT WITH

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:30.093
RESPECT TO FRAUD- HOW TO

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:31.961
MEDITATE IN. GETTING THEIR PAY.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:33.963
SO THE OTHER THING THAT WE WANT

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.466
EDT TO DO AND AGAIN THIS IS IN

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:37.700
THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:39.669
IS TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:42.538
ANNUALLY ON THE CROSS MATCHING-

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.073
HOW SUCCESSFUL HAS THAT CROSS

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.142
MATCHING BAND- HOW MANY CLAIS

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:48.244
THAT THEY IDENTIFIED HOPEFULLY.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.812
AND IN MOST CASES WE WOULD

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:51.147
EXPECT THAT THOSE WOULD BE

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:52.882
BLOCKED PAYMENTS PAYMENTS THAT

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:54.884
NEVER GOT OUT THE DOOR I TO AN

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.085
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IN

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:58.121
INCARCERATED AND OBVIOUSLY NOT

01:00:58.187 --> 01:00:59.355
ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:01.124
INSURANCE BENEFITS. I'M SO

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.891
THOSE ARE THE KEY

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.026
RECOMMENDATIONS THE

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:07.397
LEGISLATURE- AS FAR AS THE

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:09.065
PRIDE AND THE EFFECTIVENESS.

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.034
ASSESSING THOSE TOOLS WHAT

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.535
WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:15.104
DO IS REQUIRE EDT BY JANUARY OF

CONTRIBUTES TO. A LACK OF

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:11.921
PREPAREDNESS AND PLANNING TO

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:16.559
ADDRESS FROZEN. BANK ACCOUNTS

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.060
IN A TIMELY FASHION. GOT IT

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.995
THANK YOU PRESHEAF THAT I MEAN

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.564
THAT. JUST SOUNDS TO ME THAT

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:22.331
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:23.566
DO THAT QUESTION I KNOW THAT

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:24.934
THEY'RE LISTENING AND WE HAVE

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.102
THEM ON A LATER PANEL- LET ME

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:28.838
JUST ASK AT. THE ADDITIONAL

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:29.905
QUESTION DID HE DID HE GIVE A

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:31.474
REASON FOR SUSPENDING THE

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.076
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS WHICH

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:37.880
LED TO A LOT OF THE FRAUD. YES

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:40.749
SO. EDT AT THE DIRECTION OF

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.852
AGENCY SECRETARY SUSPENDED

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:44.186
THOSE ELIGIBILITY.

01:08:44.253 --> 01:08:47.022
DETERMINATIONS IN AN EFFORT TO

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:49.225
EXPEDITE PAYMENT CALIFORNIANS-

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:50.960
SO EIGHT ELIGIBILITY

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:53.095
DETERMINATION WOULD SLOW DOWN

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.563
PAYMENT. FIVE BECAUSE IT WOULD

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.232
TAKE MORE STAFF TIME TO REVIEW

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.166
THE POTENTIAL ELIGIBILITY

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:59.802
CONCERNS- IT'LL REQUIRE BACK

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:00.970
AND FORTH THE CLAIMANT

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:02.872
CONSENSUALLY- TO. MAKE AN

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:04.139
ASSESSMENT OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.808
FOR THE PROGRAM SO. THAT IS

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:06.542
CERTAINLY A MORE TIME

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.777
CONSUMING. TASK THAN JUST

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:10.045
ISSUING THE PAYMENT WITHOUT

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.914
MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. THE

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.682
INTENTION WAS TO PAY PEOPLE.

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:15.251
THEIR BENEFITS MORE QUICKLY.

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.520
BUT AS YOU NOTED. THAT DID

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:19.822
LEAVE THE EDT MORE VULNERABLE

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:21.490
TO FRAUD- BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:23.559
PAYING PEOPLE WITHOUT KNOWING.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:26.195
FOR CERTAIN THAT THEY WERE

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:27.196
ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. GOT

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:28.497
IT SO IN YOUR FINDINGS YOU

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.566
FOUND THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:31.567
FACT THAT THEY SUSPENDED THESE

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:33.068
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THEY

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:35.004
WOULD BE OPENING THEMSELVES UP.

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:39.241
BUT DECIDED TO ACCEPT THAT RISK.

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:42.344
THERE'S NO CLEAR MENTION OF THE

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:43.512
INCREASED FRAUD RISK IN THE

01:09:43.579 --> 01:09:44.813
AGENCY SECRETARY'S DIRECTIVE

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.750
THAT I CAN RECALL ANYWAY- IT

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:51.754
WAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON. WE NEED

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.222
TO SPEND THESE DETERMINATIONS

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:55.024
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE PAYMENTS IN

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:57.960
A MORE TIMELY FASHION. GOT IT

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:58.928
AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.529
QUESTION AND THEN I'LL DEFERRED

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:01.997
BY COLLEAGUES MAYBE COME BACK

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:03.599
FOR ADDITIONAL ONES BUT WANTED

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.301
TO TOUCH UPON THE CALL CENTERS

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:06.168
BECAUSE I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:08.837
HERE- ALLOCATED RESOURCES

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:10.906

AUTO REPORT. YOU SEE. ONLY A

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.682
MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS

ANSWERED- DID EDT GIVE A REASON

WHY THAT WAS OR WAS THERE

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.489
ANYTHING THAT YOU SAW. THAT

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.325
COULD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:30.926
ACTUALLY HELP THE EFFICACY

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.895

WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP PERHAPS

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:09.631
THAT THEIR- BENEFITS STOPPED

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:10.666
WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BANNED

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:12.034
CERTAINLY WE NOTE SEVERAL

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.335
CONCERNS ABOUT EIGHTY DURING IN

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.837
FACT THAT BANK OF AMERICA IS A

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.873
GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT- I WOULD

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.808
DEFER TO EDT IN TERMS OF. HOW

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.476
EXACTLY SOMEONE SHOULD. SHOULD

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:22.644
GO ABOUT TRYING TO GET THE

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:23.912
SYSTEMS WE DID NOT LOOK

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:25.781
DIRECTLY AT THE APPEALS PROCESS

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:29.451
THAT YOU REFERRED TO. BUT THIS

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:30.986
IS THE TYPE OF- THE IMPACT THAT

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:33.088
HAPPENS IF YOU'RE NOT REGULARLY

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.356
ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.525
YOUR FRAUD PREVENTION TOOLS. A

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.393
REGULAR ASSESSMENT GOING BACK

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.529
YEARS AND YEARS NOW. WOULD HAVE

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:41.964
ALLOWED EIGHTY D. TO DETERMINE

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.566
THAT IT. MORE FREQUENTLY THAN

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:46.635
IT SHOULD SWEEPS UP LEGITIMATE

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.036
CLAIMANTS IN ITS FRAUD

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.538
PREVENTION EFFORTS IF IT HAD

01:16:49.604 --> 01:16:52.074
BEEN DOING THAT ANALYSIS-

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.209
BLEEDING INTO THE PANDEMIC.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.011
THEN HOPEFULLY AND IDEALLY IT

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:56.945
WOULD HAVE FINE TUNE THOSE

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:59.247
FRAUD PREVENTION TECHNIQUES AND

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:02.384
APPROACHES SO THAT- AS FEW AS

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:03.485
POSSIBLE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:05.487
WERE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THEM

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:07.923
AND THEN ALSO. HOPEFULLY

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.457

TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THIS IS

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.893
INCOMPREHENSIBLE. IT REALLY

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.561
STARTS WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:47.829
THAT PROCEDURE MISSILES ASKING

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:50.032
ABOUT. THE PHONES AND THAT'S

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:52.100
WHAT WE'VE HEARD. TWENTY TWO

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.136
EVEN TODAY FOR CALLING HUNDREDS

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:56.238
OF HUNDREDS OF TIMES. A HUNDRED

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:58.440

BACK THAT THE MINUTE I WOULDN'T

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:04.079
START THOUGH WITH- REPORTED

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.680
EIGHT HUNDRED TEN MILLION. WAS

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.282
WENT TO INCARCERATED

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.084
INDIVIDUALS. THE OTHER NINE

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:10.352
POINT SIX BILLION IS BEING

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.387
REPORTED AS FRAUD. BUT IN

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:13.221
REALITY YOU SAY THAT THESE ARE

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:14.489
PAYMENTS WENT UNCONFIRMED

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:17.092
INDIVIDUALS SO OTHER THAN NINE

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:20.829
POINT SIX BILLION. HOW MUCH DO

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:21.329
YOU BELIEVE WAS ACTUALLY

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:26.301
FRAUDULENT. SO THAT THAT WILL.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.936
THAT'S AN ASSESSMENT THAT ATV

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:29.704
WILL NEED TO DO IN THE COMING

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.706
MONTHS- THE REASON WE'RE

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:33.742
CALLING THAT. TENSELY

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.977
FRAUDULENT IS BECAUSE EDT

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:37.779
ITSELF CONSIDERS AN UNCONFIRMED

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:40.248
IDENTITY TO BE AN INDICATOR OF

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:43.385
POTENTIAL FRAUD- CERTAINLY WE

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:46.388
INDICATE THE REPORT. THAT THERE

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.190
ARE TIMES WHERE SOMEONE WILL.

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.491
THE UNABLE TO CONFIRM THEIR

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.959
IDENTITY WITH THE TV OR CHOOSE

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.427
NOT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.963
CONFIRMING THEIR IDENTITY AND

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:58.100
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY- FRAUD

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.435
BUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IS NOT

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:01.503
KNOWN TO US BECAUSE AT THIS

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.438
POINT IN TIME IS NOT KNOWN EDT

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:04.506
THAT AS THE WORK IN FRONT OF

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.174
THEM COMING. WE SAID THEY

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:07.709
STOPPED ONE POINT SIX MILLION

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:08.844
PAYMENTS TO UNCONFIRMED

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.846
INDIVIDUALS HOW COME THE OTHER

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:13.248
FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:13.782
THOUSAND YOU IDENTIFY WENT

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:16.218
THROUGH. RIGHT SO IT'S A

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:17.486
COMBINATION OF FACTORS LIKELY

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:19.688
AND I'LL STEP THROUGH A COUPLE

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:21.790
OF THEM ONE IS THAT AT. AS A

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:22.891
STATE AUDITOR INDICATED

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:26.161
EARLIER- ET DE HAD A LARGELY

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:27.429
MANUAL PROCESS IN THE BEGINNING

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.731
OF THE PANDEMIC FOR- APPLYING

STOP PAYMENTS TO POTENTIALLY.

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.369
FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. WE TALK

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:35.570
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT THAT'S

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.305
THE FIRST STEP THE EDT TRUCK IN

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:39.808
IN JULY. TO CHANGE ITS BROAD

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:42.177
APPROACH- WHICH IS YOU KNOW

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:43.378
FIVE POINT SIX MILLION CLAIMS

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.280
INTO PANDEMIC THAT AUTOMATED

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:47.149
THAT STOP PAYMENT PROCESS SO

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:49.451
THAT IT WAS NO LONGER- STAFF

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:51.019
WHO HAD TO MANUALLY REVIEW

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:53.021
SOMETIMES OVER A THOUSAND-

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:55.257
SUSPICIOUS CLAIMS PER DAY. AND

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:56.691
APPLY THAT STOP PAYMENT

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.393
MANUALLY SOCERTAINLY BETWEEN

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.629
THE TIME EDT DETECTED. CERTAIN

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.964
CLAIMS MAYBE- SUSPICIOUS OR

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:04.232
POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT TO THE

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.267
TIME THOSE STAFF WERE ACTUALLY

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:07.702
ABLE TO APPLY. THE STOP PAYMENT

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:11.373
TO THE CLAIM PAYMENTS COULD GO

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:11.940
OUT THAT'S ONE EXPLANATION.

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.375
ANOTHER EXCELLENT. I IN

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:15.544
PARTICULAR A STARK ONE HAS TO

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.878
DO WITH THE BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.947
THAT TEN POINT FOUR BILLION-

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:19.915
THAT WE ESTIMATE WAS

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.016
POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT A

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:22.817
BILLION OF THOSE DOLLARS. WERE

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:24.352
PAID OUT BECAUSE OF A

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:25.153
DELIBERATE DECISION BY EDT

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:28.256
MANAGEMENT TO STOP USING A

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:30.425
FRAUD SAFEGUARDS. WE TALK ABOUT

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:32.160
THAT IN OUR WATER REPORT WHERE

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:33.895
WE DESCRIBE THAT EARLY ON IN

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:36.131
THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH. EDT

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:37.532
MANAGEMENT WAS TRYING TO

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:39.401
STREAMLINE THEIR PROCESS SEES

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:41.169
TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:42.337
THEY DIDN'T HAVE STUFF CLOGGING

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.940
UP THEIR SYSTEM AND STOPPING

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:46.641
PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT. AND

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:47.375
UNFORTUNATELY THEY

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:49.711
MISUNDERSTOOD. THAT THE VALUE

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:51.046
OF A PARTICULAR FRAUD SAFEGUARD

01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:52.013
THEY THOUGHT THAT IF THEY

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.982
STOPPED APPLYING. THIS STOP

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.484
PAYMENT ALERT- TWO CLAIMS WHERE

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:58.553
THEY HAD UNCONFIRMED IDENTITIES

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.188
IF THEY STOPPED APPLYING THAT

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:01.556
STOP HIM OR THAT SOMETHING ELSE

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.991
IN THERE IT SYSTEM ADDITIONAL

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.859
SAFEGUARDS WILL BACK THEM UP

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:07.696
AND STILL- STOP PAYMENTS FROM

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:09.130
GOING OUT TO THOSE CLAIMS UNTIL

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:11.066
THEY RESOLVED. THE IDENTITY OF

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:12.567
THE CLIMATE. UNFORTUNATELY THEY

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.302
WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT WHEN THEY

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:16.004
WAVE THAT STOP PAYMENT ALERT

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:16.838
WHEN THEY STOPPED REPLYING TO

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:19.274
THOSE CLAIMS. THEY PAID A

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.508
BILLION OF THE TEN POINT FOUR

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:23.211
BILLION. TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:26.081
IDENTITIES THEY COULD

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:26.815
EVENTUALLY NOT VALIDATE. IT

01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:27.716
COULD'VE BEEN WORSE THAN THAT

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:28.883
WE TALK IN THE REPORT ABOUT HOW

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.518
THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL ABOUT

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.220
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THAT WENT

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.089
OUT THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:36.791
EDT THAT BROKE FAVORABLY FOR

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.059
THEM FOR THAT FIVE HUNDRED

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:39.661
MILLION THAT WENT TO CLAIMANTS

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:40.128
WHOSE IDENTITIES WERE

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:42.063
EVENTUALLY CONFIRMED- WHICH

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.365
GIVES COMFORT THAT THAT'S NOT

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:45.133
ACTUALLY FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.535
BUT THE BULK OF IT ONE BILLION

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.037
WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.238
DECISION TO STOP JUST STOP

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:52.507
APPLYING. A KEY FRAUD

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.042
PROTECTION THAT MEASURE. THAT'S

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:54.876
RIGHT BUT THE OTHER EIGHT

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:56.878
BILLION COULD HAVE GONE TO

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:57.445
LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS IS THAT

01:21:57.512 --> 01:22:01.116
CORRECT. AND THAT'S WHAT HE

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.917
DOES NOT KNOW AT THIS POINT YOU

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.252
ARE CORRECT YES AND THAT IS%

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:05.420
WHAT YOU NEED YOU WILL HAVE TO

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.889
DETERMINE. AS IT BEGINS TO

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:09.024
ASSESS WHETHER IT OVERPAID

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.526
CLAIMS OKAY THAT'S RIGHT WHICH

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.495
IS THAT YOU KNOW BILLION IS.

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.997
UNMATCHABLE TWO BILLION IS JUST

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:17.966
THAT YOU KNOW UNEXPLAINABLE BUT

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:18.967
I THINK WE SHOULD BE CLEAR IT'S

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:20.702
BEEN REPORTED AS ALL AFFRONT

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:21.436
WHEN YOU'RE REALLY YOU'RE

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:22.704
SAYING THE OTHER EIGHT BILLION

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:23.772
COULD HAVE GONE TO LEGITIMATE

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:25.740
FOLKS. YOU JUST IT JUST MAY

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:28.109
WANT TO UNCONFIRMED ADDRESSES

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:29.577
CORRECT. I THINK WE SHOULD BE

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:31.880
CLEAR WHEN YOU. RIGHT IT WENT

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:34.649
TO CLAIMS FOR WHICH I EDT

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:36.384
CANNOT CONFIRM THE IDENTITY OF

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:37.852
THE CLIMATE AND YES WE DESCRIBE

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:40.255
IT NOT A REPORT AS POTENTIALLY

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:42.891
FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS. OR JUST A

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:43.992
WRAP UP BACK ON THE CUSTOMER

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:46.261
SERVICE A POINT- AND I

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:47.929
MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:49.297
CONSTITUENTS AND LIVE EVENTS

01:22:49.364 --> 01:22:51.533
INDUSTRY- THEIR PAYMENTS WERE

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:53.435
FROZEN THEY'VE CALLED THEY'RE

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:56.104
STILL NOT GETTING. THROUGH WHAT

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.005
IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION YOU SEEN

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:58.406
HERE THAT WE'RE NOT USING BEST

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.508
PRACTICES FOR MANAGING THE CALL

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.110
CENTER AND APPRECIATE WHAT THE

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:03.978
ORDER SAID ABOUT DOING A SORT

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:05.246
OF START STOP CONTINUE WHAT

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.448
TOOLS THEY CAN USE IN THE

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:08.717
FUTURE TO PREVENT THIS- BUT

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:09.751
WOULD YOU BELIEVE CAN BE DONE

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.119
RIGHT NOW OTHER THAN MORE

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:13.655
BODIES. TO HELP THE CALL CENTRE

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:18.026
ISSUE. SURE SO CERTAINLY THEY

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:19.894
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIND

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:21.496
MORE PEOPLE ANSWERING THE CALL

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:23.665
CENTER TO ALLOW THEM TO ANSWER

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.266
MORE CALLS SO AS I MENTIONED A

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.534
MOMENT AGO THAT. THE PRIMARY

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:28.203
CONSTRAINT IS HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:30.138
ARE ANSWERING THE PHONES. AD

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.840
THEIR MAXIMUM CAPACITY FOR HOW

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:32.640
MANY CALLS THEY CAN ANSWER

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:34.476
EVERY DAY SO THAT THAT IS THE

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:36.111
MOST IMMEDIATE BANG EDT CAN I

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:38.079
CAN DO BUT- AS WE MENTIONED IN

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:40.148
THE AUTO REPORT. AT IT'S ALSO

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:41.049
IMPOTANT THAT WHOEVER'S

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:43.051
ANSWERING THAT PHONE IS. TRULY

01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:44.285
AND GENUINELY ASSISTING THE

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.587
PERSON WITH THEIR ISSUE THE

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:46.721
REASON WHY THEY'RE CONTACTING

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:49.457
EDT SO THAT YOU'D BE AND- I'M

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:50.492
NOT HAVE THAT PERSON HAVE TO

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:52.594
CALL BACK AGAIN A SECOND THIRD

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.330
OR FOURTH TIME. WHICH PUTS A

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:56.731
STRAIN ON THE CALL CENTER

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:59.634
SYSTEM. SO AGAIN YOU'RE CORRECT

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:00.869
THAT IN THE MOST IMMEDIATE TERM

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:01.703
THEY CAN ENSURE THAT THEY

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.037
CONTINUE TO STAFF THAT CALL

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:05.607
CENTER APPROPRIATELY WITH THE

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:06.374
NUMBER OF PEOPLE. BUT IT IS

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:08.309
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY-

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:09.511
UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:11.146
CALLING. SO THAT THEY CAN

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:12.914
PROVIDE STREAMLINED QUICK HIT

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.816
TRAINING TO THEIR STAFF. FOR

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.451
HOW TO ASSIST PEOPLE WITH THAT.

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:17.585
AND THEN MEASURE WHETHER

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:19.487
THEY'RE ACTUALLY RESOLVING

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:20.221

THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE CALL

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.733
CENTER- ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.401
IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT YEARS

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:35.537
AGO WAS THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:37.639
THE ABILITY TO HAVE FOLKS YOU

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:40.241

LEAVE MY INFORMATION AND ASKED

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:44.412
FOR A CALL BACK THE OTHER THING

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:45.780

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.816
MESSAGES. PRE RECORDED

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:50.084
INFORMATION THAT A CALL OR CAN

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:51.753
LISTEN TO AND HOPEFULLY THAT

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.589
RESOLVES THEIR PARTICULAR-

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:57.559

RECORDED MESSAGES THEY HAVE THE

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:04.165
CAPABILITY TO DO THAT WITH OUR

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.167
PHONE SYSTEM THEY LOST THAT

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:07.101
FUNCTIONALITY WHEN THEY

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:10.004
IMPLEMENTED THIS VIRTUAL-

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.840
CONTACT US SO THAT THEIR

01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:13.208
COLLARS COULD BECAUSE OF THE

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:16.244
PANDEMIC- COLORS COULD BE AT

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:18.046
HOME WORKING REMOTELY- THE

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:19.581

01:25:19.647 --> 01:25:23.885
CALLED VIRTUAL. CONTACT SO-

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.220

THE PHONE SYSTEM WAS LOST THEY

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:27.956
NEED TO REINSTATE SOME OF THAT

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.824
LIKE THE PRE RECORDED MESSAGES

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:31.960
THE ABILITY TO OPT FOR A CLAIM%

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:33.495
AND TO LEAVE A MESSAGE SAYING I

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:35.430
NEED A CALL BACK FROM SOMEONE-

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:38.199
SO THAT THAT READ REDUCES THE

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.400
NUMBER OF PEOPLE CALLING

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:41.069
MULTIPLE TIMES OVER AND OVER

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:42.670

WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY. TO

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:48.476
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CALLS

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:49.811
CONTINUALLY COMING INTO THE

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.846
SYSTEM BECAUSE AS WE STATED IN

A REPORT ON THIS WAS TRUE NOT

01:25:53.781 --> 01:25:55.183

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:24.332
WOULD- THERE BE TWO BOEING

01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:26.901
DIRECT DEPOSIT AND HOW THAT

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:29.837
WOULD ADDRESS FRAUD THE SECOND

01:28:29.904 --> 01:28:32.640
MAIN QUESTION OF. THE SIDE THE

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:34.575
FIRST TO. BY UNITS IN YOUR

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.577
PRESENTATION- AT THE VERY

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:38.813
BEGINNING REFERENCED TWO

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.648
THOUSAND ELEVEN REPORT. AND

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:42.750
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU MADE-

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.519
WERE A IN YOUR AUTO AT THIS

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:46.287
TIME WAS THEIR CONSIDERATION

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:48.089
GIVEN TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:49.557
AND DETERMINATIONS MADE.

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:51.092
WHETHER THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.760
WERE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AND

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:54.929
THE REASON WHY I ASK THAT. WELL

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.397
IT IS BECAUSE IN THIS REPORT

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:58.266
THIS TIME WAS IT AS EASY AS IN

01:28:58.332 --> 01:29:00.501
SOME CASES JUST COPYING AND

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:02.136
PASTING YOUR RECOMMENDATION ALL

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:05.273
OVER AGAIN. AND HOW ARE WE ABLE

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:07.141
TO INSURE THAT WE DON'T JUST

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:08.943
RELIVE THE CYCLE FROM TWO

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.411
THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND YOUR

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.713
EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

YOU'VE MADE IN YOUR REPORT GOAL

01:29:14.048 --> 01:29:16.050
I'M IMPLEMENTED AND WE FACE

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:18.119
THIS AAIN DOWN THE ROAD SO HOW

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:21.856
BEST CAN WE ENSURE THAT YOUR

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:22.490
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GOING TO BE

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:25.593
IMPLEMENTED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.695
THAT IT TO GO IN ORDER OF YOUR

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:30.798
QUESTIONS ONE NO WE DIDN'T LOOK

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.600
SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT DATA

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:36.270
EDT GAVE US- IDENTIFY. METHOD

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:39.540
OF PAYMENT IN TERMS OF WHAT I.

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:40.908
THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:43.377
POTENTIAL FRAUD- HOW THEY GOT

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.513
PAID OUT SO TO HAVE DON'T HAVE

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.748
ANY INFORMATION FOR YOU ON THAT

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:47.882
AND I THINK TO THE QUESTION

01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:49.851
ABOUT DIRECT DEPOSIT. I BELIEVE

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.252
YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:52.553
PRACTICE SOME OTHER STATES

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.489
ENGAGE IN WHERE THEY ALLOW FOR

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:55.523
PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THEIR BENEFIT

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.158
PAYMENTS THROUGH DIRECT DEPOSIT

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.292
I'M CERTAINLY AWARE THAT AT

01:29:58.359 --> 01:29:59.460
LEAST THERE'S BEEN ONE BILL

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:00.595
INTRODUCED THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:02.063
PEOPLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:04.599
SUCH AN OPTION- BUT WE MAKE NO

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:07.602
DIRECT. AUDIT FINDING ABOUT-

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:09.837
THAT THE PROS OR CONS OF MOVING

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.973
IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN WE HAVE

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:14.075
NO DATA ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:16.577
POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS

01:30:16.644 --> 01:30:17.178
IN TERMS OF HOW THEY GOT PAID

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.579
OUT. WITH RESPECT TO THE CALL

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:19.714
CENTER RECOMMENDATIONS THERE

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:21.149
SIMILAR TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:22.750
WE MADE IN THE PREVIOUS REPORT.

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:25.353
AND SILVA COPIED AND PASTED

01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:26.988
NECESSARILY BUT THEY ARE IN THE

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:28.990
IN THE SPIRIT OF. THE SAME

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:30.424
RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE FROM

01:30:30.491 --> 01:30:32.193
PAST AUDIT REPORTS AND REALLY

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.095
THAT COMMON THREAD I EDT NEEDS

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.097
TO BE. ADHERING TO THE BEST

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:38.266
PRACTICES. THAT ARE COMMONLY

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:40.201
ACCEPTED FOR HOW TO RUN A CALL

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:42.270
CENTER OPERATION. SO THAT IT IS

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:43.871
THE MOST HELPFUL TO THE PEOPLE

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:46.741
WHO NEED TO USE THAT- WE HAD

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.176
ASSESSED THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:49.911
IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE ONES

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:51.512
FROM THE PRIOR AUDIT REPORT BUT

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:52.547
WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE ARE BACK IN

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:54.382
THIS TIME. THAT HE WAS NOT

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:55.583
FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH

01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:57.351
CONTINUALLY IMPLEMENTING THOSE

01:30:57.418 --> 01:30:58.386
RECOMMENDATIONS SO THEY MAY

01:30:58.452 --> 01:30:59.253
HAVE DONE SOMETHING IN THE

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.455
PAST. THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT IT

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:03.558
WE SAID THIS IS GOOD. THE

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.326
SATISFIES OUR RECOMMENDATION.

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:07.028
WHAT WE DIDN'T SEE WAS THE

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:08.029
FOLLOW THROUGH WE DIDN'T SEE

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:09.897
THEM CONTINUING TO ADOPT. AND

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:11.265
FOLLOW THROUGH ON THOSE BEST

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.501
PRACTICES AND THAT'S WHERE- IF

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:14.936
THEY ARE LEFT THEMSELVES UP IN

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:16.771
SOME PRETTY KEY DEFICIENCIES.

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:17.772
WITH RESPECT OVERSIGHT

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.140
CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW

UP WITH EDT ABOUT THESE

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:23.144
RECOMMENDATIONS- I THINK OUR

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:25.046
FIRST RESPONSE IS DUE BACK FROM

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:27.048

RECOMMENDATION. AND WE CAN

PROGRESS EDB IS OR IS NOT.

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:48.169
MAKING TO ADDRESS THOSE

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:48.970
PROBLEMS. AND JUST ONE TO ADD

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:52.840
TO THAT- IS THAT- WE MADE

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:54.275
SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.444
LEGISLATURE WE BELIEVE THAT

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.712
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

01:31:57.778 --> 01:31:59.046
NEED TO PUT BE PUT INTO

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:01.249
STATUTE. LIKE THE CROSS

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:02.617
MATCHING REQUIREMENTS THE

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:04.218
REQUIREMENT TO PUT TOGETHER

01:32:04.285 --> 01:32:06.454
RECESSION PLAN AS AS BOB

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.456
INDICATED THEY THEY HAD MADE

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:09.690
SOME IMPROVEMENTS WITH RESPECT

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:11.259
TO THE CALL CENTER AND SOME OF

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:12.526
THEIR CLAIMS PROCESSING WHEN WE

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:15.997
REVIEWED THEIR RESPONSES TO US-

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:18.165
AFTER WE ISSUED THE MARCH OF

01:32:18.232 --> 01:32:19.400
TWENTY ELEVEN REPORT BUT WE DID

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:21.035
A FOLLOW UP AUDIT IN NOVEMBER

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:22.236
OF TWENTY TWELVE WHICH WAS

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:26.140
BEYOND. BEYOND ONE YEAR. WHICH

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:28.209
TYPICALLY IS THE CYCLE IN.

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:29.710
SIXTY DAYS SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:33.948
IS A TYPICAL CYCLE FOR AND IT'S-T. TO REPLY TO US RESPOND TO US

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:34.982
AS TO WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:37.218
IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:38.286
WHEN WE HIT THE ONE YEAR MARK

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:40.354
THINGS ARE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD-

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:42.623
THEY WERE STILL. IMPLEMENTING

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.325
SOME NEW CHANGES TO THEIR THEIR

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.726
CALL CENTER THEY WERE ALSO

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:46.961
IMPLEMENTING SOME OTHER

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:49.764
AUTOMATION- EFFORTS SO WE

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.999
DECIDED TO GO BACK IN NOVEMBER

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:52.867
OF TWENTY TWELVE AND

01:32:52.934 --> 01:32:54.468
UNFORTUNATELY WE FOUND THAT AS

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:55.703
MR HARRIS INDICATED SOME OF

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:57.371
THOSE THINGS HAVE SLIPPED BACK

01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:59.106
SO THERE WASN'T CONSISTENT

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:01.542
CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT- AND

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:05.880
FOLLOW THROUGH AND. SOME OF THE

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:06.480

FIRST YEAR AFTER THAT MARCH

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:12.753
TWENTY ELEVEN REPORT SO I THINK

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.789
THE DISTINCTION NOW WILL BE.

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.324
MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.125
THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRING SOME

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:19.794
OF THESE THINGS THAT WE LIKE

ACROSS MATCHING. ASSESSING

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:29.270
THEIR FRAUD TOOLS REPORTING TO

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:30.738
THE LEGISLATURE PUTTING THINGS

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:32.740

EDIE'S PROGRESS. IN CERTAIN

01:33:38.012 --> 01:33:40.581

INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WERE

01:36:01.856 --> 01:36:05.092
VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT SO I

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.327
JUST WANT TO SORT OF PUT THAT

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:08.195
OUT THERE BECAUSE I KNOW WE

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:08.829
TEND TO MISS CHARACTERIZE THOSE

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:11.832
FOLKS. THE REPORT AND THE

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:12.666
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU'VE

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:14.668
OFFERED FOCUS A LOT ON

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:17.037
INDIVIDUALS I WAS WONDERING IF

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:18.772
YOU COULD ALSO SPEAK TO.

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:20.574
ORGANIZATIONS SPECIFICALLY

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:22.910
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:25.679
ALSO SEEM TO BE CAUGHT UP IN

01:36:25.746 --> 01:36:29.483
SOME OF THIS SO SPECIFICALLY-

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:31.285
MANY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:32.720
TEND TO SELF ON UNEMPLOYMENT

01:36:32.786 --> 01:36:34.755
INSURANCE THEY PAY OUT THE

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:38.225
CLAIMS. AND- THAT THEY-

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:39.627
BELIEVED TO BE OBVIOUSLY

01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:42.997
LEGITIMATE- BUT THEN IN THIS

01:36:43.063 --> 01:36:44.698
INSTANCE MANY OF THEM ENDED UP

01:36:44.765 --> 01:36:48.068
BEING FRAUDULENT. AND SO IT'S

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:49.904
NOT ONLY IS PUTTING A NUMBER OF

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.572
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.474
THE BOYS AND GLUBB BOYS AND

01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:55.609
GIRLS CLUB AND SOME OTHERS IN

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:58.479
FINANCIAL PERIL. BUT THEY'RE

01:36:58.546 --> 01:37:00.147
ALSO BEGINNING TO SEE A LOT OF

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:02.049
THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS GO UP

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:04.585
BECAUSE OF THOSE CLAIMS SO HAS

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.287
YOUR OFFICE LOOK AT THIS

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:09.056
POPULATION AND ARE THERE ANY

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:11.025
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU WOULD

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:14.195
HAVE FOUR EDT REGARDING HOW TO

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:16.463
ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. THAT

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:18.132
MANY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:20.034
ARE NOW FACING AS A RESULT OF

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.070
THE FRAUD. WE DIDN'T

01:37:23.137 --> 01:37:25.072
SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT NONPROFIT

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:27.841
ORGANIZATIONS THEY THE AUDIT-

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:28.943
THE EMERGENCY ON IT THAT THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE ASKED US TO DO

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:31.946
IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:32.680
EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:34.748
DEPARTMENT'S PERFORMANCE IN

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.850
ASSISTING CALIFORNIANS IN

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:39.153
ACCESSING. BENEFITS AND

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:41.755
CERTAINLY- THEIR ABILITY TO

01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:42.890
PREVENT FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:45.059
FROM GOING OUT SO WE DIDN'T

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:46.994
LOOK AT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:50.764
AND- YOUR COMMENTS WITH RESPECT

01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:53.267
TO INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS IS

01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:54.668
ISN'T REALLY IMPORTANT POINT.

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:56.170
ARE THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS IT'S

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:57.605
MY UNDERSTANDING WE DON'T GET

01:37:57.671 --> 01:37:59.106
INTO THE DETAILS IN THE AUDIT

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:01.342
REPORT ON THAT WERE VICTIMS OF

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:03.143
IDENTITY THEFT- WHO ARE

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:07.915
INCARCERATED- SO THAT IS THAT

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:09.116
IS AN IMPORTANT TO. A POINT

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:11.819
THAT YOU MADE AS I SAID WE ARE

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:14.121
OUR FOCUS REALLY WAS EDT

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:16.857
NEEDING TO HAVE THAT CAPABILITY

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:17.992
TO CROSS MATCH AGAINST

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.693
INDIVIDUALS AND IN THE EVENT

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:22.062
THEY DETERMINE THAT- AN

01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:24.164
INDIVIDUAL INCARCERATED HAS IS

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:25.366
A VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT THEY

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:27.001
NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL.

01:38:27.067 --> 01:38:28.269
AND THAT'S ANOTHER WORKLOAD

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:30.404
ISSUE FOR EAT EAT EAT WHEN WE

01:38:30.471 --> 01:38:33.607
LOOKED- ACT HOW WELL EDT WAS

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:36.377
DOING IN. REVIEWING COMPLAINTS

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:37.444
THAT WERE COMING IN FROM

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:38.846
INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THEIR

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:40.914
IDENTITY WAS STOLEN AND THEY

01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:42.783
WERE WAY BEHIND TYPICALLY THEY

01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:43.951
GET ABOUT SIX THOUSAND

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:45.519
COMPLAINTS WE LOOKED AT TWENTY

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:46.487
NINETEEN THEY GOT ABOUT SIX

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:47.221
THOUSAND COMPLAINTS OF IDENTITY

01:38:47.288 --> 01:38:49.356
THEFT- AND HAD BEEN WORKING

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:50.324
THROUGH THOSE IN TWENTY

01:38:50.391 --> 01:38:52.426
NINETEEN. WHEN WE LOOKED ON

01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:53.160
DURING THE COURSE OF THE OUT

01:38:53.227 --> 01:38:55.029
AND THEY WERE OVER SEVENTY

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:56.397
THOUSAND COMPLAINTS AND THEY

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:57.998
HAD NOT REVIEWED VERY MANY OF

01:38:58.065 --> 01:39:00.100
THOSE AT THAT POINT IN TIME SO

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:01.402
THERE ARE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:03.404
OUT THERE PARTICULARLY TIED TO

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:06.173

GOING OUT TO THE SUSPICIOUS

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.043
ADDRESSES OR GOING TO

HOUSEHOLD HAS FILED. FOR

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:14.915
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE- AND

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:16.317
THEY'RE SCARED THEY'RE AFRAID

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:18.485
THEY MAY HAVE THEIR IDENTITY

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.487
STOLEN- AND THEY'RE- SUBMITTING

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:22.222

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:23.957
THAT CLARIFIED WE ALSO POINT

01:39:24.024 --> 01:39:25.192
OUT AND REPORT THEIR MAYBE ON

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:26.894
SOME INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE WHO

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.262

THE IRS- AND INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.509
GOING TO BE SHOCKED BY THAT AND

01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:44.111
BE REACHING OUT TO EIGHTY SO I

01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:46.013
THINK THAT. IDENTITY THEFT

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.115
AFFECTS A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:49.717

INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:55.889
ARE IN THOSE CROSS MATCHES ARE

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:57.157
LIKELY INDIVIDUALS WHOSE

01:39:57.224 --> 01:40:00.027
IDENTITY WAS USED- TO FOR

01:40:00.094 --> 01:40:01.528
SOMEONE TO FRAUDULENTLY GET

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:03.297
PAYMENTS. BUT AGAIN THE

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.765
IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THIS IS

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:09.737
EDT NEEDS TO DO THAT CROSSMATCH.

TO DETERMINE. WHICH ONES ARE

01:40:15.242 --> 01:40:17.578
FRAUDULENT- AND WHICH ONES THEY

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:20.314
CAN. THEY CAN- YOU KNOW. MAKE

THAT SOME OF THOSE WERE FROZEN.

SLOW. WAY THE EDT REACTED TO

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:16.523
THE INCREASED PROGRESS AT THE

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:18.592
BEGINNING A PANDEMIC AND WE'RE

LIKE THE WAVE TO SAFEGUARD.

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:25.932
THAT LET ONE BILLION OF THAT

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:28.001
TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

BE PAID OUT. N. ET DE DID NOT

01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:33.473

BE CLEAR THOSE PAYMENTS WERE

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:37.744
MADE. AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:44.050
E. D. WAS NOT SURE. THE ONE

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:45.485

THE IDENTITY OF STUFF YES IT'S

01:48:52.158 --> 01:48:55.195
TROUBLING TO SEE THAT BUT WE

01:48:55.262 --> 01:48:55.729
THINK WE'VE INDICATED SOME

01:48:55.795 --> 01:48:59.733
PRETTY- MAJOR REASONS WHY BAD

01:48:59.799 --> 01:49:01.768

POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS.

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:08.708
PARENTS HAVE SIR JUST LAST HAVE

THAT. I'VE INTENTIONAL

01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:30.430
SAFEGUARD WOULD STOP PAYMENTS

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:31.898

BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT WORKING

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.828
IT HASN'T WORKED. THIS IS NOT

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:02.829
JUST WHAT ADMINISTRATION'S

01:50:02.896 --> 01:50:04.831
FAILURE IT'S MULTIPLE

01:50:04.898 --> 01:50:05.432
ADMINISTRATIONS THAT GOES ON

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:13.306
CITY HAS OVERSIGHT BUT- HOW WE

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:14.841
REALLY DEAL WITH THIS AND DRILL

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.076
DOWN TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:16.676
HAPPEN AGAIN. BECAUSE

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:18.578
OBVIOUSLY. YOU'RE RECOGNITION

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.380
THAT BEEN IGNORED. THE

01:50:20.447 --> 01:50:22.916
LEGISLATURE IS BEING ORDERED TO

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:23.550
APPOINT A WE TALKED ABOUT THIS

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.618
IN OCTOBER. WE HAVE THE-

01:50:25.685 --> 01:50:27.187
BEVERLY HILLS MAYOR THE POLICE

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:29.055
SYSTEM POLICE CHIEF TALK ABOUT

01:50:29.122 --> 01:50:30.090
THEIR ISSUES THE MOST THOSE

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:33.293
FOLKS- DOING EASY CARDS WERE

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.731
FROM OUT OF STATE. SO HOW WE

01:50:37.797 --> 01:50:38.531
ONCE AND FOR ALL. PUT THIS TO

01:50:38.598 --> 01:50:40.400
BED JUST WITH PEOPLE AGENCIES

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:42.369
THAT CAN. NO THE LEGISLATURE.

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:44.304
IN GOVERNING. IT REALLY

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:48.808
HAMMERED HOME. WELL THAT'S A

01:50:48.875 --> 01:50:50.377
GREAT QUESTION MR COOPER- I

01:50:50.443 --> 01:50:52.312
THINK ABSOLUTELY SOME OF THE

01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:54.314
RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE TO A

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:56.216
LEGISLATURE TO PUT SOMEOF THIS

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:57.250
SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IN

01:50:57.317 --> 01:51:00.320
STATUTE- THE ANNUAL REPORTING

01:51:00.387 --> 01:51:03.256
REQUIREMENTS- FOUR EIGHTY TO

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:04.391
REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE NOT

01:51:04.457 --> 01:51:05.692
JUST ON FRAUD BUT ON THE CROSS

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:08.328
MATCHING- THERE IS ALSO AN

01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:11.898
ANNUAL REPORT YEAH EDT HAVE TO

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:12.766
REPORT TO THE FEDERAL

01:51:12.832 --> 01:51:14.901
GOVERNMENT. HOW WELL IT'S DOING

01:51:14.968 --> 01:51:17.137
AS FAR AS GETTING THOSE INITIAL

01:51:17.203 --> 01:51:19.939
CLAIMS PAID WITHIN A FOURTEEN

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:21.708
DAY OR TWENTY ONE DAY WINDOW-

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:22.776
AND THAT'S SOMETHING ON AN

01:51:22.842 --> 01:51:24.477
ANNUAL BASIS THAT EDT REPORTS

01:51:24.544 --> 01:51:25.912
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:27.814
ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT AS PART

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:30.050
OF FEDERAL COMPLIANCE WORK THAT

01:51:30.116 --> 01:51:32.318
WE DO. BUT AGAIN THERE'S A LOT

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:33.653
OF STATES THAT STRUGGLE TO DO

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:34.687
THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:37.323
EXCUSES FOR EDT BUT I DO THINK

01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:39.292
SOME OF THE RECESSION PLANNING

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:41.027
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THE

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:42.629
STRIKE TEAM IDENTIFIED AS FAR

01:51:42.695 --> 01:51:45.965
AS WORKLOAD- ANALYSES AND AN

01:51:46.032 --> 01:51:48.268
EDT MAKING BETTER DECISIONS AS

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:49.869
TO WHERE THEY CAN ASSIGN THEIR

01:51:49.936 --> 01:51:51.738
STAFF WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:53.073
THAT'S WHY WE TRIED TO

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:54.774
PRIORITIZE THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:56.409
YEAH BUT WE ALSO TRIED TO POINT

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:59.179
OUT THAT NOT ONLY DOES EDT HAVE

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:00.780
TO DEAL WITH PROCESSING CLAIMS

01:52:00.847 --> 01:52:02.749
AS THEY CONTINUE TO COME IN BUT

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:03.850
THEY'VE PUT THEMSELVES IN A

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:05.852
VERY DIFFICULT POSITION NOW

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:07.821
BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:09.389
THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

01:52:09.456 --> 01:52:10.657
THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIFFERENT

01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:13.193
THEIR CERTIFICATIONS AND US

01:52:13.259 --> 01:52:14.961
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR CAME DOWN

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:17.530
AND SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT- SO

01:52:17.597 --> 01:52:20.033
THEY HAD TO RE ESTABLISH THOSE

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.468
REQUIREMENTS BUT NOW THEY HAVE

01:52:21.534 --> 01:52:24.104
THIS ADDITIONAL BACKLOG. OF

01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:27.040
MILLIONS OF ISSUES AND MILLIONS

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:28.708
OF CLAIMANTS THAT THEY NOW HAVE

01:52:28.775 --> 01:52:30.643
TO ADDRESS AND THEN IN ADDITION

01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:32.479
TO THAT THEY HAVE AS I TALKED

01:52:32.545 --> 01:52:34.247
ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO THE-

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:36.382
IDENTITY THEFT PROBLEM WHERE

01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:38.284
THEY HAD OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND

01:52:38.351 --> 01:52:40.453
COMPLAINTS R. AS A VICE IT WAS

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.788
NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WHEN WE

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:43.857
WERE LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE SO

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:45.058
EDT REALLY NEEDS TO COME UP

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:48.995
WITH. AND THAT'S PART OF THE

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:49.996
RECESSION LAND PART OF WHAT

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:51.998
SHOULD DO A- AS- WATER ALL OF

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:53.833
OUR WORK. IS YOU ARE ASSESSMENT

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.535
AND LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT HOW

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:57.270
ARE WE GOING TO ASSIGN STAFF TO

01:52:57.337 --> 01:52:58.638
BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH ALL OF

01:52:58.705 --> 01:53:00.607
THIS. IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:03.276
THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE- OUR-

01:53:03.343 --> 01:53:05.345
CONCERN AS MISTER GIBSON AND

01:53:05.411 --> 01:53:06.646
MANY IF YOU I'M SURE ALL OF

01:53:06.713 --> 01:53:09.182
YOUR CONSTITUENTS- THERE'S MANY

01:53:09.249 --> 01:53:10.517
PEOPLE OUT THERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:12.418
WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING- THAT

01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:15.722
NEED HELP- SO. I THINK THAT

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:16.756
SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:18.191
THAT WE'VE MADE WILL ASSIST

01:53:18.258 --> 01:53:19.759
WITH THAT BUT I REALLY THINK

01:53:19.826 --> 01:53:22.462
WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:24.497
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT

01:53:24.564 --> 01:53:26.666
IS JUST MONITORING WHAT DO YOU

01:53:26.733 --> 01:53:29.202
NEED EDT IS DOING. TO ASSESS

01:53:29.269 --> 01:53:30.570
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT IN SOME

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:31.871
OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU

01:53:31.938 --> 01:53:33.239
NEEDING. YOU GOT IT YOU KNOW

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:34.274
YOU'VE GOT TWELVE MILLION

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.943
ISSUES TIED TO TWO POINT FOUR

01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:39.712
MILLION. CLAIMANTS BOMB WHERE

01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:41.047
YOU PASS JUST THE ELIGIBILITY

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:43.183
DETERMINATIONS. DO A RISK

01:53:43.249 --> 01:53:44.784
ASSESSMENT OF THOSE YOU KNOW

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:47.086
BASED ON PAST HISTORY. WHICH OF

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:49.322
THOSE TYPICALLY RESULT ARE ARE

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:51.424
A FRAUDULENT CLAIM BEING

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:54.060
SUBMITTED. SO DO THAT RISK

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:55.628
ASSESSMENT SO THAT YOU'RE USING

01:53:55.695 --> 01:53:58.665
YOUR RESOURCES. TO THE BEST

01:53:58.731 --> 01:54:01.100
POSSIBLE YOU KNOW THE HIGHEST

01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:03.069
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES SAME

01:54:03.136 --> 01:54:04.370
THING WITH THE CALL CENTER.

01:54:04.437 --> 01:54:05.872
WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED THE

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:08.308
VIRTUAL CALL ABILITY TO HAVE

01:54:08.374 --> 01:54:10.176
THEIR THEIR CALL CENTER FOLKS

01:54:10.243 --> 01:54:11.578
BE ABLE TO WORK REMOTELY

01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:13.079
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THEY

01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:14.681
LOST SOME OF THE FUNCTIONALITY

01:54:14.747 --> 01:54:15.682
THAT THEY HAVE IN THE PHONE

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:18.084
SYSTEM THAT WOULD BENEFIT FOLKS

01:54:18.151 --> 01:54:18.985
IMMEDIATE AND THEY HAVE THE

01:54:19.052 --> 01:54:20.753
CAPABILITY WITH OUR PHONE

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:21.654
SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT THOSE

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:23.256
TOOLS. GET THOSE TOOLS

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:25.024
IMPLEMENTED SO I THINK EATING

01:54:25.091 --> 01:54:27.493
NEEDS TO COME UP WITH- AND

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:28.761
PERHAPS A DIRECTOR OF TALK

01:54:28.828 --> 01:54:31.197
ABOUT IT TODAY AND- AS FAR AS

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:32.999
WHAT THEY'RE WORKING ON. FROM A

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:35.335
STAFFING PERSPECTIVE A WORKLOAD

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:36.936
PERSPECTIVE AND BEING ABLE TO

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:38.137
DO THAT RISK ASSESSMENT

01:54:38.204 --> 01:54:40.340
PRIORITIZE. WHAT ARE THE THINGS

01:54:40.406 --> 01:54:42.175
THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH RIGHT

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:44.544
NOW AND WHAT RESOURCES DO WE

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:46.546
HAVE AVAILABLE. TO ADDRESS

01:54:46.613 --> 01:54:48.248
THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES BUT

01:54:48.314 --> 01:54:50.450
THEN ALSO JUST CONTINUING TO

01:54:50.516 --> 01:54:53.286
MONITOR AS AS BOB INDICATED.

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:55.021
THIS ORDER IS A LITTLE

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:56.389
DIFFERENT THAN OUR TRADITIONAL

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:57.423
AUDITS THAT WOULD PUT OUT

01:54:57.490 --> 01:54:59.192
NORMALLY IT'S A SIXTY DAY SIX

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:01.027
MONTHS ONE YEAR. RESPONSE TIME

01:55:01.094 --> 01:55:02.528
FRAME WE DID DECIDED UNDER THE

01:55:02.595 --> 01:55:04.163
EMERGENCY AUTHORITY UNDER J.

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:07.166
LACK BUT I ALSO IDENTIFIED THIS

01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:08.801
SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA IS A

01:55:08.868 --> 01:55:11.537
HIGH RISK SITUATION SO. WE PARK

01:55:11.604 --> 01:55:13.940
WE ARE COMBINED. A COUPLE OF

01:55:14.007 --> 01:55:15.908
AUDIT TEAMS UNDER MR HARRIS'S

01:55:15.975 --> 01:55:17.777
LEADERSHIP. WHERE WE WERE DOING

01:55:17.844 --> 01:55:19.712
WORK UNDER THE EMERGENCY

01:55:19.779 --> 01:55:21.481
REQUESTS FROM J. LACK AND THEN

01:55:21.547 --> 01:55:22.749
OUR HIGH RISK OF TORY THAT

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:25.218
ALLOWED US TO DO THIS. MORE IN

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:27.053
DEPTH COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.389
AND AUDIT. AND WHAT THAT MEANS

01:55:29.455 --> 01:55:31.057
WITH RESPECT TO EDT REPORTING

01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:32.725
TO US IT'S A IT'S A NINETY DAY

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:34.761
WINDOW SO EVERY NINETY DAYS WE

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:39.599
WILL BE GETTING. REAP REPORTS

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:40.166
BACK FROM EATING. THE OTHER

01:55:40.233 --> 01:55:41.167
THING WE CAN DO IS WE CAN ASK

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:42.035
FOR A- MORE FREE. THAN THAT

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:43.036
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME

01:55:43.102 --> 01:55:44.637
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'RE

01:55:44.704 --> 01:55:45.905
SUGGESTING YOU HAVE THIS DONE

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:47.407
IN FEBRUARY YOU NEED TO HAVE

01:55:47.473 --> 01:55:49.142
THIS DONE IN MARCH SO WHEN WE

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:51.077
HEAR BACK FROM MEETING WE CAN

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:52.178
PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:53.813
AND SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT WE TRULY

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.947
NEED TO GET THIS DONE BY

01:55:55.014 --> 01:55:56.649
FEBRUARY THEY GOT IT DONE OR

01:55:56.716 --> 01:55:58.084
THEY DIDN'T GET IT DONE AND

01:55:58.151 --> 01:55:59.585
THIS IS WHY THEY DIDN'T GET IT

01:55:59.652 --> 01:56:01.988
DONE SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:04.524
IS KEPT APPRISED OF. YOU KNOW

01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:06.959
EDIE'S PROGRESS NOT ONLY FROM

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:08.795
E. D. THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH

01:56:08.861 --> 01:56:09.862
I TRUST THEY WILL CONTINUE TO

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:10.797
COMMUNICATE WITH THE

01:56:10.863 --> 01:56:13.232
LEGISLATURE. BUT USING US AS

01:56:13.299 --> 01:56:15.868
YOUR INDEPENDENT SOURCE TO SAY

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:17.236
EDT IS ASSERTING THEY'VE DONE

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:19.205
THESE THINGS WE VERIFIED YEAH

01:56:19.272 --> 01:56:19.706
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

01:56:19.772 --> 01:56:21.107
ACCOMPLISH THIS OR THEY'RE

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:22.608
SUGGESTING THEY CAN'T AND THIS

01:56:22.675 --> 01:56:24.410
IS WHY. AND WE THINK THAT'S A

01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:27.046
REASONABLE EXPLANATION- SO.

01:56:27.113 --> 01:56:31.451
JUST TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE.

01:56:31.517 --> 01:56:32.051

01:56:32.118 --> 01:56:35.188
LEGISLATURE. ALL RIGHT SIR MR

01:56:35.254 --> 01:56:36.656
KILEY YOUR MIKE SIR PLEASE GO

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:40.727
AHEAD. THANK YOU MISS HOW FOR

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:42.562
THESE- REPORTS YOU KNOW IT'S

01:56:42.628 --> 01:56:44.464
INTERESTING TO SEE THAT THE

01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:46.265
HAND WRINGING IN THE VENTING-

01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:48.868
IN THIS LEGISLATURE ABOUT- THE

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:51.003
EDT IS THAT THERE WERE SOME

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:53.039
EXHAUSTION IS ACTOR WHO'S JUST

01:56:53.106 --> 01:56:55.208
SUDDENLY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE-

01:56:55.274 --> 01:56:57.677
AND BOARDED OUR WELL LAID PLANS

01:56:57.744 --> 01:56:59.178
WHEN IN FACT THIS IS AN ARM OF

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:00.847
THE STATE- THAT'S IMPLEMENTING

01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:03.816
POLICIES- PASSWORD LEGISLATURE.

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:05.518
ANDTHAT STAFF IN ACCORDANCE

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:08.421
WITH STATE LAW- SO WHEN I SEE

01:57:08.488 --> 01:57:09.389
IN THE REPORT THEY DIDN'T DO

01:57:09.455 --> 01:57:10.323
THIS THEY DIDN'T AS THEY DON'T

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:11.591
DO THIS OVER THE COURSE OF

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:14.694
HOWEVER MANY YEARS- YOU KNOW A

01:57:14.761 --> 01:57:16.429
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED WHY IS

01:57:16.496 --> 01:57:17.663
THAT I WANT TO ASK THAT IN A

01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:20.166
MORE SPECIFIC WAY. BECAUSE IF

01:57:20.233 --> 01:57:21.901
THE AGENCY IS CONSISTENTLY NOT

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:23.603
BEEN FOLLOWING BEST PRACTICES

01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:25.204
IN THE WAY THAT A WELL RUN A

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:26.806
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WOULD I ONLY

01:57:26.873 --> 01:57:28.975
SEE TWO POSSIBILITIES ONE IS

01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:30.309
THAT THE FOLKS IN MANAGEMENT

01:57:30.376 --> 01:57:32.111
ROLES- ARE NOT CAPABLE THEY'RE

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:32.812
NOT COMPETENT THEY'RE NOT

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:34.614
QUALIFIED WHATEVER THE CASE MAY

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.916
BE OR THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:38.184
THAT MAYBE THERE ARE CAPABLE

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:40.887
PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE LEGAL-

01:57:40.953 --> 01:57:43.389
BARRIERS SYSTEMIC BARRIERS-

01:57:43.456 --> 01:57:45.625
THAT PREVENT THEM FROM MANAGING

01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:47.693
THE ORGANIZATION. IN ACCORDANCE

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:50.430
WITH BEST PRACTICES SO BASED

01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:52.198
UPON YOUR STUDY OF THIS AGENCY-

01:57:52.265 --> 01:57:53.699
WHICH IS IT IS IT THE FACT THAT

01:57:53.766 --> 01:57:55.601
WE HAVE POOR PEOPLE POOR

01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:56.769
LEDERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT

01:57:56.836 --> 01:57:58.504
POSITIONS AT THE AGENCY OR IS

01:57:58.571 --> 01:57:59.639
THERE SOMETHING THAT'S GETTING

01:57:59.705 --> 01:58:03.443
IN THEIR WAY. OF MANAGING THE

01:58:03.509 --> 01:58:05.044
AGENCY WHILE. I'M NOT AWARE OF

01:58:05.111 --> 01:58:07.180
ANY STATUTORY LIMITATIONS OR

01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:09.482
ANYTHING THAT PRECLUDES EDT

01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:10.950
FROM BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:12.785
RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE NOW TEN

01:58:12.852 --> 01:58:13.820
YEARS AGO WHICH THEY WERE

01:58:13.886 --> 01:58:16.189
STARTING TO DO. BUT THEN THEY

01:58:16.255 --> 01:58:18.191
THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH. SO

01:58:18.257 --> 01:58:20.460
I THINK THAT LEADS US TO YOUR

01:58:20.526 --> 01:58:23.563
FIRST NOW- OPTION. IS

01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:25.465
MANAGEMENT AND I THINK. YOU

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:26.466
KNOW MANAGEMENT HAS A LOT TO DO

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:28.034
WITH IT AT THIS STATE AGENCY MY

01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.570
STUDENTS MY AGENCY ANY STATE

01:58:30.636 --> 01:58:32.705
AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:34.006
THAT IT'S THERE IT'S THE CLICHE

01:58:34.073 --> 01:58:35.374
TERM BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:37.243
STONE FROM THE TOP. MAKING SURE

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:39.912
THAT- YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP IS

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:42.448
LAYING OUT EXPECTATIONS. FOR

01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:43.883
EMPLOYEES IN THAT PARTICULAR

01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:46.552
ORGANIZATION- I THINK EDT LIKE

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:48.988
A LOT OF LARGE AGENCIES IN

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:51.224
CALIFORNIA. IT'S SUCH A HUGE

01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:53.826
BUREAUCRACY IT'S DIFFICULT TO

01:58:53.893 --> 01:58:55.962
GET THAT TONE FROM THE TOP. YOU

01:58:56.028 --> 01:58:58.331
KNOW PUSH DOWN THROUGH ALL OF

01:58:58.397 --> 01:58:59.966
THE SECTORS WITHIN THE

01:59:00.032 --> 01:59:02.568
ORGANIZATION I THINK. EDT IS

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:04.270
NOT ALONE IN THIS. NOW I'VE

01:59:04.337 --> 01:59:05.404
BEEN THE AUDITOR FOR A LONG

01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:06.606
TIME THERE ARE A LOT OF STATE

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:08.574
AGENCIES THAT ARE JUST YOU KNOW

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:10.376
ENTRENCHED IN THEIR TRADITIONAL

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:12.211
PROCESSES. THIS IS THE WAY

01:59:12.278 --> 01:59:13.546
WE'VE DONE IT THIS IS THE WAY

01:59:13.613 --> 01:59:15.181
WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT I DON'T

01:59:15.248 --> 01:59:18.784
UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED TO

01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:19.585
CHANGE. I MEAN SOME OF THE

01:59:19.652 --> 01:59:20.386
THINGS THAT EIGHTY THE EMPEROR

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:22.655
THIS YEAR. AUTOMATE USING ID ME

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:25.024
THERE WAS A HUGE CHANGE AS FAR

01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:26.959
AS GOING FROM A MANUAL PROCESS

01:59:27.026 --> 01:59:28.861
TO VERIFY SOMEBODY'S IDENTITY

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:31.497
WHERE. CLOSE 250% OF PEOPLE

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:34.133
SUBMITTING A CLAIM. THEY HAD TO

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:36.002
GO THROUGH THAT MANUAL PROCESS

01:59:36.068 --> 01:59:37.637
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ID ME

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:39.138
DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN PLACE THEY

01:59:39.205 --> 01:59:41.040
PUT ID BE IN PLACE IN OCTOBER.

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:43.175
AND THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

01:59:43.242 --> 01:59:44.176
THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:59:44.243 --> 01:59:45.278
ARE ABLE TO VERIFY THEIR

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:47.346
IDENTITY GET THAT CLAIM EXCEPT

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:48.581
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PROCESS

01:59:48.648 --> 01:59:51.651
BEGIN. SO I THINK. THERE THERE

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:54.220
CERTAINLY IS A NEED AT THE AT

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:57.823
THE HIGHEST LEVELS BUT ALSO TO

01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:58.891
BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW. MAKE IT

01:59:58.958 --> 02:00:00.726
CLEAR TO FOLKS AT THE LINE

02:00:00.793 --> 02:00:02.261
LEVEL WHO ARE DOING THE WORK ON

02:00:02.328 --> 02:00:03.763
A DAILY BASIS THIS IS WHAT WE

02:00:03.829 --> 02:00:05.331
EXPECT TO DO WE NEED TO HEAR

02:00:05.398 --> 02:00:06.732
FROM YOU WHAT ARE THE ISSUES

02:00:06.799 --> 02:00:08.167
YOU'RE YOU'RE RUNNING UP

02:00:08.234 --> 02:00:10.102
AGAINST- DO WE PROVIDE

02:00:10.169 --> 02:00:12.338
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ON SOME

02:00:12.405 --> 02:00:13.406
OF THE ISSUE RELATED TO

02:00:13.472 --> 02:00:15.775
TRAINING- AS BOB SAID YOU KNOW

02:00:15.841 --> 02:00:18.077
WHEN WE LOOK AT- EDT TEN YEARS

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:20.479
AGO IT TOOK ON THIRTEEN

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:21.314
FOURTEEN MONTHS TO TRAIN

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:22.214
SOMEONE NOW THEY'RE SAYING WE

02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:23.749
STREAMLINED IT DOWN TO NINE.

02:00:23.816 --> 02:00:24.584
WELL I THINK THEY NEED TO BE

02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:27.119
MORE CREATIVE THAN THAT. DO WE

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:28.020
IS THERE A WAY WE CAN

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:31.123
STREAMLINE THAT EVEN MORE OR DO

02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:32.858
AN ANALYSIS OF WHY PEOPLE ARE

02:00:32.925 --> 02:00:35.595
CALLING. HAVE THREE RECORDED

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.496
INFORMATION ON THEIR ON THEIR

02:00:37.563 --> 02:00:39.599
WEBSITE OR ON THEIR IN THEIR

02:00:39.665 --> 02:00:41.200
CALL SYSTEM HAVE FREQUENTLY

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.168
ASKED QUESTIONS ON THEIR

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:44.637
WEBSITE- THEY RECEIVED A LOT OF

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:46.072
INFORMATION ONLINE THAT THEY

02:00:46.138 --> 02:00:47.807
JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO RESPOND

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:48.674
TO BECAUSE IT WELL WE HAVEN'T

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:50.109
HEARD FROM THAT PERSON AGAIN.

02:00:50.176 --> 02:00:51.711
SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:00:51.777 --> 02:00:53.779
SOME STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP- FROM

02:00:53.846 --> 02:00:55.514
THE DIRECTOR AND OTHERS. AND I

02:00:55.581 --> 02:00:57.950
KNOW THERE'S A- BRAND NEW TEAM

02:00:58.017 --> 02:00:59.151
OVER THERE. AND THEY ARE

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:00.152
COMMITTED I WANT TO LET THE

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:01.854
MEMBERS NOW I'VE HAD A

02:01:01.921 --> 02:01:03.222
CONVERSATION WITH THE DIRECTOR

02:01:03.289 --> 02:01:04.624
I'VE HAD CONVERSATION WITH THE

02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:08.794
AGENCY SECRETARY- AND SOME OF-THE OTHER. STAFF WERE HIRED

02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:10.096
INTO MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AT

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:12.965
EDT AND I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND

02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:14.533
THEY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:16.636
CRISIS THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN.

02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:17.103
BUT I THINK THEY ALSO

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:18.638
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:21.240
AGENCY. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S KIND

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:23.976
OF EMBEDDED IN OLD BUREAUCRACY

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:26.045
ALL PROCESSES AND WE NEED TO BE

02:01:26.112 --> 02:01:27.480
MUCH MORE CREATIVE. AND

02:01:27.546 --> 02:01:29.382
APPROVING AS FAR AS USING

02:01:29.448 --> 02:01:31.417
AUTOMATION I'M DOING THESE RISK

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:32.952
ASSESSMENTS MAKING SURE WE'RE

02:01:33.019 --> 02:01:34.787
DOING A BETTER JOB AS FAR AS-

02:01:34.854 --> 02:01:37.456
STAFFING. WHAT ISSUES ARE WE

02:01:37.523 --> 02:01:40.292
ADDRESSING FIRST ARE WE GOING

02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:41.927
ABOUT PROVIDING STAFF. TO

02:01:41.994 --> 02:01:43.062
RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:45.431
THAT- WE CERTAINLY IDENTIFIED

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:47.266
IN THE REPORT AND EDS IS WELL

02:01:47.333 --> 02:01:49.602
AWARE OF. SO IF OFTEN A POINT

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:50.436
ABOUT HOW IT'S SORT OF THIS

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:51.704
ENTRENCHED- YOU KNOW

02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:53.039
BUREAUCRACY THAT SET IN ITS

02:01:53.105 --> 02:01:54.607
WAYS SO YEAH LET'S SAY THAT YOU

02:01:54.674 --> 02:02:01.580
WERE ABLE TO BRING IN- TWENTY

02:02:01.647 --> 02:02:02.181
FIVE THIRTY LIKE TO PICK YOUR

02:02:02.248 --> 02:02:02.815
NUMBERS AND I. THE BEST

02:02:02.882 --> 02:02:03.683
MANAGERS IN THE PRIVATE. MOST

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:04.817
CAPABLE WHO COMPLETE REPLACE.

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:06.652
THE OPERATION ON OF MANAGEMENT.

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.254
WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO YOU

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.356
THINK GET THE TO RIGHT THE SHIP

02:02:10.423 --> 02:02:12.758
WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO DO IT OR

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:13.292
WOULD THERE BE THINGS THAT

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:15.261
STILL STOOD IN THEIR WAY. I'M

02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:16.429
I'M NOT AWARE OF THINGS THAT

02:02:16.495 --> 02:02:18.464
WOULD STAND IN THEIR WAY BUT I

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.733
DO THINK WE NEED TO DO A COUPLE

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:23.602
OF THINGS EDT HUGE AGENCY- AND

02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:24.770
I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT CHEAP

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:28.207
BUT IT BUT IT IS A HUGE AGENCY.

02:02:28.274 --> 02:02:29.175
AND THEN IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED

02:02:29.241 --> 02:02:31.077
BUT WITH ALL THAT SAID. THERE

02:02:31.143 --> 02:02:32.578
CLEARLY WERE LESSONS LEARNED

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:35.347
FROM THE LAST RECESSION TWO

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:35.915
THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND

02:02:35.981 --> 02:02:37.349
EIGHT. WHERE YOU KNOW THEY THEY

02:02:37.416 --> 02:02:38.617
WERE REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO

02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:40.419
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:41.420
YOU KNOW AFTER A YEAR GOES BY

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:43.456
THEY KIND OF. BACK AWAY AND GET

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:45.458
CAUGHT UP IN THE DAY TO DAY

02:02:45.524 --> 02:02:47.760
OPERATIONS AND I THINK. SOME OF

02:02:47.827 --> 02:02:48.761
THE EXAMPLES WE HAVE IN THE

02:02:48.828 --> 02:02:50.730
AUDIT REPORT LIKE WHEN BOB SAID

02:02:50.796 --> 02:02:52.698
THAT YOU KNOW THEY THE AGENCY

02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:55.468
SECRETARY DIRECTED THEM TO.

02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:56.736
HELP BASICALLY SHUT OFF A

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:59.004
SAFEGUARD WELL EDT SHOULD HAVE

02:02:59.071 --> 02:03:00.372
DONE ASSESSMENT SAID OKAY BUT

02:03:00.439 --> 02:03:02.308
IF WE DO THAT. HERE'S THE COST

02:03:02.374 --> 02:03:03.876
BENEFIT WE'RE GONNA GET

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:06.078
PAYMENTS OUT MUCH MORE QUICKLY.

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:07.379
BUT HERE'S THE RISK OF FRAUD.

02:03:07.446 --> 02:03:09.148
DO WE REALLY WANT TO DO THAT

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:09.915
AND THERE COULD HAVE BEEN THE

02:03:09.982 --> 02:03:11.650
CONVERSATION. WELL YEAH LET'S

02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:12.918
DO THAT BUT LET'S MAKE SURE

02:03:12.985 --> 02:03:14.920
THESE OTHER FRAUD MANY. FRAUD

02:03:14.987 --> 02:03:16.489
TOOLS ARE GOING TO PREVENT

02:03:16.555 --> 02:03:18.624
PAYMENTS FROM GOING OUT. AND IT

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:21.393
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN AND-

02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:21.961
TALKING WITH THE AUDIT TEAM

02:03:22.027 --> 02:03:23.729
ACTUALLY. SPEAKING WITH THE

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:25.297
AGENCY SECTOR RECENTLY THOSE

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:26.565
TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS WEREN'T

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:29.401
HAPPENING- SO I THINK IF YOU

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:31.203
BRING IN ARE THEY HAVE YOU KNOW

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.338
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BROUGHT

02:03:32.404 --> 02:03:34.673
IN SOME NEW FOLKS- THAT WILL

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.308
MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT THIS

02:03:36.375 --> 02:03:37.476
ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:39.111
CHANGE OVERNIGHT I THINK THERE

02:03:39.178 --> 02:03:39.845
ARE THINGS THEY CAN DO

02:03:39.912 --> 02:03:42.014
IMMEDIATELY- I THINK THEY-

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:43.516
SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:44.950
WE'LL DO OUR JOB AND HOLDING

02:03:45.017 --> 02:03:46.285
THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO IMPLEMENT

02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:47.920
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:49.989
STEADFAST WITH THAT- AND I

02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:52.057
THINK THAT'S- THE BEST I CAN

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.159
GIVE YOU AT THIS POINT MR

02:03:53.225 --> 02:03:56.362
KILEY. AGAIN I THINK THAT'S AN

02:03:56.428 --> 02:03:57.129
IMPORTANT QUESTION ALSO FOR THE

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:58.798
DEPARTMENT- AND THE

02:03:58.864 --> 02:04:00.633
ADMINISTRATION TO ANSWER. THANK

02:04:00.699 --> 02:04:01.867
YOU VERY MUCH AS MY FINAL

02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:03.435
COMMENT YOU KNOW- WE SEE THIS

02:04:03.502 --> 02:04:05.437
ISSUE AS YOU NOTED ACROSS

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:06.572
DIFFERENT AGENCIES IS NOT JUST

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:07.773
THE MEDIA THIS IS CERTAINLY

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:09.441
BECOME THE POSTER CHILD FOR.

02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:11.911
AFTER GOVERNMENT FAILURE- AND

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:13.579
SO IF THE PROBLEM REALLY IS

02:04:13.646 --> 02:04:14.947
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT

02:04:15.014 --> 02:04:16.849
PEOPLE. IN MANAGEMENT ROLES

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:18.083
THEN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:20.286
RAISES THE QUESTION. OF HOW DO

02:04:20.352 --> 02:04:22.421
WE IMPROVE THAT PROCESS SO THAT

02:04:22.488 --> 02:04:23.622
WE CAN ATTRACT THE BEST AND

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:25.558
BRIGHTEST INTO THESE POSITIONS-

02:04:25.624 --> 02:04:27.226
OF SUCH POWER. AT THAT HAVE SO

02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:28.794
MUCH INFLUENCE OVER THE LIVES.

02:04:28.861 --> 02:04:30.429
OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:30.863
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:31.697
RECOMMENDATIONS HERE WHICH ARE

02:04:31.764 --> 02:04:32.965
GREAT IS A GOOD RECOMMENDATION

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:34.667
YOU PROVIDED BUT- EVEN SOME OF

02:04:34.733 --> 02:04:35.701
THE ONES TO THE LEGISLATURE IN

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:36.902
SOME SENSE A BLUR THE LINE

02:04:36.969 --> 02:04:38.404
BETWEEN POLICY AND MANAGEMENT.

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:39.772
AND I THINK THAT PERHAPS WOULD

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:41.707
BE BETTER SERVED IF WE LOOK AT

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:44.543
THE OVER ARCHING POLICIES. THAT

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:48.914
ARE DETERMINING. WHO WINDS UP

02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:49.582
LEADING THESE STAY AGENCIES AN

02:04:49.648 --> 02:04:50.516
WE FIX THE- SO THAT WE ACTUALLY

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:51.550
HAVE. WHO HAVE GOOD MANAGEMENT

02:04:51.617 --> 02:04:53.319
EXPERIENCE WILL BRING THE BEST

02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:54.353
PRACTICES OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:55.988
IN THE GOVERNMENT. THEN YOU

02:04:56.055 --> 02:04:57.089
KNOW WE WOULDN'T NEED TO KEEP

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:58.991
HAVING AUDITS LIKE THIS WITH

02:04:59.058 --> 02:04:59.558

RAISES UP THE ISSUE OF

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:35.581
OVERSIGHT AND AGGRESSIVE

02:07:35.647 --> 02:07:37.449
OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE.

02:07:37.516 --> 02:07:39.051
AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO

02:07:39.118 --> 02:07:40.519
RIDE THE WAVE OF OVERSIGHT IS A

02:07:40.586 --> 02:07:42.488
BODY INTO THE FUTURE. IN THE

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:44.123

FOCUS ON THE TVAND THE

02:07:54.833 --> 02:07:57.403
SPECIFIC THIS. I WANT TO URGE

02:07:57.469 --> 02:07:59.405
ALL TO TAKE A LOOK AT

02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:03.242

HUNDRED AND THE FOLLOWING. THAT

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:05.978
IS ACTUALLY THE STATE

02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:08.981
LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.

02:08:09.048 --> 02:08:10.182
AND THIS IS A BODY OF LAW THAT

02:08:10.249 --> 02:08:11.650
HAS ACTUALLY SEEN A LOT OF

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:16.155
ACTIVITY IN THE LAST. TEN YEARS.

02:08:16.221 --> 02:08:17.156
AND GOING BACK TO TWENTY ELEVEN

02:08:17.222 --> 02:08:19.691
WAS. A STRAIGHTENER THE STATUTE

02:08:19.758 --> 02:08:20.993
IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY

02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:24.863
AUDITS AND FINANCIAL AUDITS. TO

MOVEMENT TO MODIFY THAT. I

02:08:32.471 --> 02:08:33.572
THINK YOU'RE FOR SOME FIRST

02:08:33.639 --> 02:08:35.307
PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENTAL

02:08:35.374 --> 02:08:37.109
ACCOUNTING. THAT WE WILL FIND

02:08:37.176 --> 02:08:38.844
IF WE GO BACK TO THE STATUTE AS

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:40.913
EXISTED BACK. WHEN WE WERE

02:08:40.979 --> 02:08:44.416
SWORN IN REFER NOW THE CLASS OF

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:45.584
TWENTY TWELVE. AND I THINK THIS

OF. IT IS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL

02:08:48.821 --> 02:08:50.923

DISTRIBUTED WHICH- MAY ALSO BE

02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:01.279
A PROBLEM. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT

02:27:01.345 --> 02:27:02.513
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FRAUD WOULD

02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:04.482
BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND

02:27:04.549 --> 02:27:06.250
THIRTY BILLION DEPENDING ON

BACK OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE

02:27:28.472 --> 02:27:31.576
YEARS- DEPENDING ON HOW LONG IT

02:27:31.642 --> 02:27:33.711
TAKES TO GET OUT. SO THAT'LL BE

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:35.446
THAT'LL BE THE EXTENT THE MATH

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:37.381

REASONS WHY I INITIATED A

03:07:31.340 --> 03:07:34.042
CRITICAL ISSUES FOR. OUR CALL

03:07:34.109 --> 03:07:37.045
CENTER. SO I'M NOT BIG ON A LOT

03:07:37.112 --> 03:07:40.115
OF PLANTS I'M GETTING ACTION.

03:07:40.182 --> 03:07:41.249

03:07:41.316 --> 03:07:43.885

US FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THEN.

03:07:53.562 --> 03:07:56.431
WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR

03:07:56.498 --> 03:07:57.966
QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS TO GET

03:07:58.033 --> 03:08:00.068

TIME LINE SO IT GETS TO PEOPLE

03:08:04.206 --> 03:08:08.577
THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. HOW I'M VERY

03:08:08.644 --> 03:08:10.078
HIGH ON TRANSPARENCY BUT I

03:08:10.145 --> 03:08:12.047
THINK TRANSPARENCY IS USELESS

03:08:12.114 --> 03:08:13.782
WITHOUT ACCURACY SO I'M GOING

03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:16.351

THAT WAS AT THE TWENTY ONE DAY

03:11:13.094 --> 03:11:15.797
MARK AND THAT IS UP FROM JUST

03:11:15.864 --> 03:11:17.999
30% OF THE TIME AS OF TEN

03:11:18.066 --> 03:11:18.600
THIRTY ONE WE WERE MAKING THE

03:11:18.667 --> 03:11:20.569

NEED TO GET EIGHTY SEVEN AND

03:11:22.037 --> 03:11:23.738
HIGHER. THAT IS THE FEDERAL

03:11:23.805 --> 03:11:26.007
MANDATE THAT IS THE MARK BUT IT

03:11:26.074 --> 03:11:27.609
IS ENCOURAGING TO SEE THAT

03:11:27.676 --> 03:11:28.710
WE'RE LEAST GOING IN THE RIGHT

03:11:28.777 --> 03:11:31.513

THOUGHT I SAW ONE NUMBER. BUT

03:12:08.683 --> 03:12:10.685
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ATTRIBUTED

03:12:10.752 --> 03:12:12.554
TO THE U. Y. PROGRAM AND HOW

03:12:12.621 --> 03:12:13.922

AND- DIRECTOR SCIENCE TOUCHED

03:13:11.513 --> 03:13:13.214
UPON THIS EARLY BUT THE

03:13:13.281 --> 03:13:15.050
DECISION TO SUSPEND THE

03:13:15.116 --> 03:13:17.118
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS UP LED

03:13:17.185 --> 03:13:18.753

BEING DONE TO SAFEGUARD- THOSE

03:13:27.362 --> 03:13:30.165
TAXPAYER DOLLARS FROM FRONT

03:13:30.231 --> 03:13:33.034
CONTINUING TO. EXIST IN THE

03:13:33.101 --> 03:13:36.504
SYSTEM. LET ME TRY TO ADDRESS

03:13:36.571 --> 03:13:40.108
THAT AND THEN- HELLO YES YOU

03:13:40.175 --> 03:13:45.347
CAN DISCUSS MORE OF IT. SO AS I

03:13:45.413 --> 03:13:47.015
SAID I WASN'T THERE FOR SOME OF

03:13:47.082 --> 03:13:49.484
THE DECISIONS WERE MADE TO

03:13:49.551 --> 03:13:50.085
UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE PROCESS

03:13:50.151 --> 03:13:52.320
OF. WHEN THE PROCESSING THESE

03:13:52.387 --> 03:13:54.222
CLAIMS. ARE THROUGH OUR

03:13:54.289 --> 03:13:56.825
TECHNOLOGY OUR SYSTEM BEGAN TO

03:13:56.891 --> 03:14:00.261
SLOW DOWN. AND FOR THOSE OF THE

03:14:00.328 --> 03:14:01.830
MEMBERS FEEL ARE WITH

03:14:01.896 --> 03:14:04.132
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S A VERY BAD

03:14:04.199 --> 03:14:06.801
SIGN AND IF YOU PUSH THE SYSTEM

03:14:06.868 --> 03:14:08.603
WHAT'S BEGINNING TO SLOW DOWN

03:14:08.670 --> 03:14:10.839
IN THE BALLING THAT WE HAD THEN

03:14:10.905 --> 03:14:12.007
THE SYSTEM OF THE CRASH. I

03:14:12.073 --> 03:14:14.776
THINK THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE

03:14:14.843 --> 03:14:17.746
ELEMENTS IN THE DECISION WAS

03:14:17.812 --> 03:14:19.514
MADE AT THE TIME. THAT'S IF YOU

03:14:19.581 --> 03:14:20.815
HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY I WOULD

03:14:20.882 --> 03:14:23.785
JUST THAT YOU KNOW- FROM FROM

03:14:23.852 --> 03:14:25.553
WHAT I HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST

03:14:25.620 --> 03:14:26.621
FEW MONTHS THAT I'VE BEEN

03:14:26.688 --> 03:14:27.789
HEARING SOME OF THE DECISIONS

03:14:27.856 --> 03:14:30.358
THAT WERE MADE. I MEAN I CAN'T

03:14:30.425 --> 03:14:32.060
FIND ONE THAT WAS NOT A GOOD

03:14:32.127 --> 03:14:36.031
FAITH ATTEMPT. TO PAY PEOPLE

03:14:36.097 --> 03:14:39.467
WHO WERE DESPERATE FOR HELP-

03:14:39.534 --> 03:14:40.802
YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT

03:14:40.869 --> 03:14:43.538
THAT'S- IS SORT OF THE

03:14:43.605 --> 03:14:46.007
UNDERLYING- COMMENT THAT I

03:14:46.074 --> 03:14:47.475
WOULD MAKE ON ON SOME OF THE

03:14:47.542 --> 03:14:49.411
DECISIONS NOT HAVING BEEN HERE

03:14:49.477 --> 03:14:51.579
BUT I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT

03:14:51.646 --> 03:14:55.116
THAT. WAS A BIG PIECE OF IT

03:14:55.183 --> 03:14:58.086
REMEMBER. YEAH AND I UNDERSTAND

03:14:58.153 --> 03:15:02.557
THE SUDDEN URGE AN UP TICK IN.

03:15:02.624 --> 03:15:04.025
TRYING TO ADDRESSED CLAIMANTS

03:15:04.092 --> 03:15:05.894
BUT YOU KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING

03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:08.797
TO IS THAT EDT REMOVE SOME OF

03:15:08.863 --> 03:15:09.831
THOSE SAFEGUARDS WHICH WAS

03:15:09.898 --> 03:15:12.167
OUTLINED IN THE AUTUMN. TRYING

03:15:12.233 --> 03:15:12.667
TO UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE

03:15:12.734 --> 03:15:14.369
SAFEGUARDS WERE REMOVED THERE

03:15:14.436 --> 03:15:16.404
WAS ONLY FOR EXPEDIENCY BUT AT

03:15:16.471 --> 03:15:18.139
WHAT COST AND WE'RE LOOKING AT

03:15:18.206 --> 03:15:19.774
THE COSTS THAT BEING A MINIMUM

03:17:27.202 --> 03:17:28.503
THESE REFORMS WERE IMPLEMENTED

03:17:28.570 --> 03:17:30.004
PREVIOUSLY FROM THE LAST

03:17:30.071 --> 03:17:32.440

NOW- DO APPRECIATE THAT BUT- I

03:17:37.946 --> 03:17:40.148
THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA EAGERLY.

03:17:40.215 --> 03:17:44.385
WAIT YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL

03:17:44.452 --> 03:17:45.620

CALTRANS PARTNERS IN THE

03:17:52.393 --> 03:17:54.395
LEGISLATION- THAT HAS BEEN

03:17:54.462 --> 03:17:55.530
INTRODUCED SO FAR IN THE

03:17:55.597 --> 03:17:56.831
LEGISLATURE TO ACTUALLY

03:17:56.898 --> 03:17:58.233
IMPLEMENT THESE REFORMS THAT

03:17:58.299 --> 03:18:01.236
YOU SEEM TO WANT TO EMBRACE AND

03:18:01.302 --> 03:18:04.272
HOPING YOU DO AND THAT'S

03:18:04.339 --> 03:18:06.708
GENUINE- BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD

03:18:06.774 --> 03:18:09.577
IT. THERE'S STILL. STILL A LOT

03:18:09.644 --> 03:18:11.312
OF QUESTIONS AND JUST THE

03:18:11.379 --> 03:18:12.513
OVERALL WHAT IS THE

03:18:12.580 --> 03:18:15.516
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS-

03:18:15.583 --> 03:18:20.321
NOT ONLY THE DEFICIENCIES BUT-

03:18:20.388 --> 03:18:21.422
HOW ARE WE MOVING TO MAKE SURE

03:18:21.489 --> 03:18:22.790
THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL

03:18:22.857 --> 03:18:23.358
RECEIVING THE BENEFITS THAT

03:18:23.424 --> 03:18:25.927
THEY NEED I THINK THAT. YOU

MEMBERS KIND OF COME BACK TO

03:18:28.563 --> 03:18:29.364
THOSE TWO POINTS AND I THINK

03:18:29.430 --> 03:18:30.832
IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO CLEAR

03:18:30.898 --> 03:18:32.700
INDICATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT.

03:18:32.767 --> 03:18:34.302
OUR GETTING THERE AND I THINK

03:18:34.369 --> 03:18:35.003
THAT'S WHAT THE AUDITOR WAS

03:18:35.069 --> 03:18:37.405
IDENTIFYING IS A COMPREHENSIVE

03:18:37.472 --> 03:18:45.046
PLAN- IN PLACE. IN THE ECONOMY

03:18:45.113 --> 03:18:46.748
THAT WE EXPECT AN UPTICK OVER

03:18:46.814 --> 03:18:50.852

AUDITOR. AS A CORPORATE OR WHAT

03:18:59.994 --> 03:19:01.396

03:19:12.140 --> 03:19:14.375
HOW THE DEPARTMENT. SHOULD BE

03:19:14.442 --> 03:19:15.743
ANTICIPATING WHAT IS GOING TO

03:19:15.810 --> 03:19:19.213
HAPPEN. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:22.884

03:31:39.119 --> 03:31:40.421
LINE ITEM IN EXORBITANT MANY

03:31:40.487 --> 03:31:42.156
TIMES WE ACTUALLY SPEND THAT

03:31:42.222 --> 03:31:44.024
TIME FRAME TO THE THINK IT'S-

03:31:44.091 --> 03:31:45.426
FEBRUARY THE FIFTEENTH WHICH IS

03:31:45.492 --> 03:31:46.994
AN EXTRA THIRTY DAYS. BUT THE

03:31:47.061 --> 03:31:47.961
REASON WHY THERE IS A TIME

03:31:48.028 --> 03:31:49.963
FRAME BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T IT

03:31:50.030 --> 03:31:51.732

ATTEMPT. TO GO THROUGH IT ME

03:31:56.136 --> 03:31:58.138
THAT NEVER ATTEMPT TO REALLY

03:31:58.205 --> 03:31:59.907
VALIDATE THEIR IDENTITY. THIS

03:31:59.973 --> 03:32:02.376
IS THE GROUP THAT YOU KNOW HOW

03:32:02.443 --> 03:32:03.077
THERE'S THE STRONGEST

03:32:03.143 --> 03:32:05.179
INDICATIONS OF FRAUD. AND

03:32:05.245 --> 03:32:06.547
CERTAINLY WE WILL CONTINUE IN

03:32:06.613 --> 03:32:07.681
THE PROMISED TO CONTINUE TO

03:32:07.748 --> 03:32:09.349
WORK ON THOSE FILTERS. SO THAT

03:32:09.416 --> 03:32:11.652
WE ARE ONLY- IDENTIFYING THOSE

03:32:11.718 --> 03:32:13.153
THAT HAVE THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST

03:32:13.220 --> 03:32:16.056
LEVEL OF. RISK OF FRAUD BUT

03:32:16.123 --> 03:32:20.260
THAT IS WHY BECAUSE THERE IS AN.

03:32:20.327 --> 03:32:21.795
END TO THIS AFTER. PROBABLY

03:32:21.862 --> 03:32:24.932
PROBABLY. TIME IS. SO AND I AND

03:32:24.998 --> 03:32:26.066
