MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE -- WITHIN THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND TAKE ANY VOTES AFTER WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. I ALSO WANT TO ANNOUNCE TO THE FOLLOWING MEASURES HAVE BEEN PULLED FROM TODAY'S HEARING. SB ONE SB FIVE FIVE ONE AND SB. SIX TWENTY ONE AT OUR FIRST ITEM UP IS MS REYES 2%. AJ ARE TEN WAS REYES WHENEVER YOU ARE READY YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NUMBER. EIGHT OR TEN MAKES A STATEMENT REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP BY ARTICULATING THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT. OF OUR AUTHORITY TO ENACT STRICTER AIR POLLUTION STANDARDS PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. WAIVERS OFFERED UNDER THIS ACT WHICH HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN SUPPORT OF OUR BIPARTISAN BASIS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO SET A STANDARD. CURRENTLY FOLLOWED BY OVER THIRTEEN STATES AND JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. AS MANY OF YOUKNOW THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY RECENTLY PROPOSED. UNDER THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION. THE SAFER AFFORDABLE FUEL EFFICIENT. OR AT THE SO CALLED SAFE VEHICLE ROOM THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO TAKE ACTION THAT WOULD WEAKEN THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ENACT POLICIES. THAT ADDRESS PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CONTINUE TO ADDRESS. CLIMATE CHANGE. THE NATIONAL NATIONAL MINISTRATIONS. THE FEDERAL MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL AIMS TO AND CURRENT FUEL ECONOMY TARGETS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND WITHDRAWAL CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO SET OUR OWN MORE STRINGENT VEHICLE STANDARDS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS EMBARKED ON A POORLY CRAFTED STRATEGY TO ROLL BACK THE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA'S MADE ON CLEAN AIR. DESPITE THE SUPPOSED BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSAL THE CONSEQUENCES OF ADOPTING THIS STANDARD HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE DETRIMENTAL. IT IS ESTIMATED AT THAT TAKING THIS ACTION WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE OIL CONSUMPTION BY APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. BUT IT IS ESTIMATED TO POTENTIALLY COST CALIFORNIA THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS DUE TO NEGATIVE AFFECTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. GROUPS FROM OF OUR FROM ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO AUTO MAKERS HAVE STATED THE CONCERNS. EARLY THIS EARLIER THIS MONTH SEVENTEEN MAJOR AUTOMAKERS INCLUDING BMW FORD GM AND OTHERS WROTE A LETTER CLAIMING THAT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED PLAN WOULD CAUSE INSTABILITY. DUE TO THE CURRENT STANDOFF WITH CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA WAS CLEARLY STATED THAT WE SUPPORT CLEAN AIR AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE MOST CONCENTRATED AREA WE CAN'T TODAY. THAT IS TRANSPORTATION. SUPPORT OF AG ARE TEN IS A VOTE FOR SCIENCE AND CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO PROTECT OUR AIR WITHOUT COMPROMISING CONSUMER VOICES. AND CONSUMER CHOICE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION ARE NIKITA KARATE WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND BILL MCGAVIN WITH THE KELP COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS BILL AGAIN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR STRONG SUPPORT. OF THIS MEASURE CALIFORNIA HAS HAD AND HAS USED THE AUTHORITY TO SET STANDARDS FOR MOBILE SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND THAT'S ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE SUCCESS WE'VE HAD. IN REDUCING OUR AIR POLLUTION UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THAT SUCCESS TRANSPORTATION STILL ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN 80% OF THE AIR POLLUTION THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND ABOUT HALF OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. MY ORGANIZATION WAS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF FRIEND PAVEL EASE CALIFORNIA CLEAN CARS LAW PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WHICH WAS THE FIRST MEASURE. IN THE COUNTRY THAT SET GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS FOR MOTOR VEHICLES AND HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IT BECAME A NATIONAL STANDARD. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND ITS THAT NATIONAL AGREEMENT THAT THIS TRUMP ROLL BACK IS SEEKING TO DISRUPT AND TO BREAK AND TO STOP THE THE GREAT SUCCESS. THAT WE AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW THAN HAVING WITH TAIL PIPE STANDARDS AND THE ROLL BACK IS SO MISGUIDED THAT IT REALLY IS. ONLY STANDS TO BENEFIT THE OIL COMPANIES THAT HAVE SECRETLY LOBBIED FOR IT SO A CALIFORNIA AS THE GOVERNOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN DOING NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS MISGUIDED ROLL BACK AND TO ASSERT AUTHORITY OVER CLEAN CAR STANDARDS THANK YOU. CHEN MEMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I'M ON BEHALF OF ENERGY SEIZE MORE THAN THREE MILLION MEMBERS AND ACTIVISTS I'M HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR. TEN AND HE'S HE'S PART OF A COALITION OF ORGANIZATIONS AND STATES THAT IS VIGOROUSLY FIGHTING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S UNJUSTIFIED AND FAULTY ROLLBACK. OF COMMONSENSE CLEAN CAR AND FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS AND IS WORKING TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY OUR ENVIRONMENT AND CONSUMERS' POCKETBOOKS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL RELIES ON FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS THAT LEAD TO A RONI SWING FLAYED IT COSTS AND BOGUS SAFETY CLAIMS. AT THE FIVE YEARS OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THAT EXISTING STANDARDS ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY ACHIEVABLE. DISMANTLING THE STANDARDS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE EPA'S MANDATE UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE. IT ALSO FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S MANDATE DOES THAT MAXIMUM FEASIBLE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS. AND PER THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S OWN ANALYSIS THE ROLL BACK PUT THOUSANDS OF JOBS AT RISK ALL WHILE MAKING CONSUMERS PAY MORE AT THE PUMP. INCREASING OUR DEPENDENCE ON OIL INCREASING POLLUTION FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND THREATENING THE WELL BEING OF CONSUMERS WORKERS AND ALL THOSE WHO DEPEND ON CLEAN AIR AND A STABLE CLIMATE. AJ ARE TEN SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE TO OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IT'S THEIR DUTY TO PROTECT ITS PEOPLE AND NOT THE SELF SERVING INTERESTS OF THE OIL INDUSTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT. FOR THIS ITEM. THE COMMISSION ALSO [inaudible] FOR THANK YOU. WELL WE WANT TO HEAR YOU. HOW MUCH TIME?

SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WELL I WILL JUST I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- OUR CLEAN AIR STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN AGREED SUCCESS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT TRANSPORTATION IS THE ONE SECTOR WERE NOT GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS SO WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE WORK NOT LESSEN THIS RESOLUTION I THINK HAS A VERY GOOD MESSAGE -- TO THE WHITE HOUSE SO THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU AFTER WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE A VOTE ON THE ITEM.

SURE GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU AND LET ME START OFF BY SAYING I WILL TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS HOUSE WHEN I THINK -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WHOSE CO AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. SB ONE SIXTY EIGHT WOULD ESTABLISH THIS CHEAP CLIMATE RESILIENCE OFFICER HOUSE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH THROUGHOUT THE OUR STATE WE HAVE SEEN THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF OUR CHANGING. CLIMATE AND HOW SEVERELY DESTROYS OUR COMMUNITIES LOCAL ECONOMIES AND LEAD TO LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. THE CALIFORNIA IS FOURTH CLIMB ASSESSMENT. CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT POINTS THE DRIER CONDITIONS IN THE FUTURE INTERRUPTED BY LARGER INTENSE STORM BURST -- THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF FLOODS WE NEED A WELL COORDINATED STRATEGY BASED ON THE LATEST SCIENCE ENABLE OUR STATE TO BE RESILIENT ENOUGH TO MEET. THESE ANOTHER INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES DOWN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I AUTHORED SB. TWO FOUR SIX WHICH ADDRESSED THE LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING BETWEEN THE STATE THE REGION'S AND LOCAL ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA IT'S THE VERTICAL NOT SO MUCH THE HORIZONTAL -- DISCUSSIONS THIS BILL TAKES THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP THE CREATES THE CHEAPER SO IN OFFICER IN OPR. AND THE CHEESE CHIEF OFFICER WOULD BE THE STATE WIDE LEAD TO MANAGE THE EFFORTS ON ADAPTATION. THROUGH THE CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER THE ADVISORY COUNCIL AND STAFF WILL FACILITATE COORDINATION AMONG STATE REGIONAL LOCAL AGENCY EFFORTS TO ADOPT TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES MEMBERS WITH ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE -- ON THE ADVISORY COUNCIL STACKERS ARE FOUR YEAR TERMS -- AND WHEN YOU ESTABLISH A QUORUM I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. I WITNESSES THAT WOULD THIS IS A POOR PLACE GOOD AFTERNOON BRAIN AND ALSO SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT OF US BE ONE SIXTY A IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA SEEN AN INCREASE IN EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS SUCH AS WILDFIRES DROUGHT AND SEA LEVEL RISE. THESE IMPACTS CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE ONLY EXPECTED TO WORSEN AS WE'VE GONE PAST THE POINT OF PREVENTING THE CONSEQUENCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND GLOBAL WARMING. THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY TO PREPARE FOR THE INEVITABLE AND HELP BILL CLIMATE RESILIENCE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PHONE OAKLEY. AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEMS AND WE BELIEVE SB ONE SIX EIGHT WOULD YOU JUST THAT BY INSTALLING A CHIEF CLIMATE OFFICER IN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING A RESEARCH THAT RECORD NAME PLAN. FOR EVENTS JUST LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE -- AND WITH THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB ONE SIX INNER DRIVE A THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GREAT COOK WITH HIM YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY IN SUPPORT THE BILL [inaudible] IN THE IN A SCAN ON BEHALF MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN SUPPORT.

STATING THAT I I DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR WORK IN -- WITH MY OFFICE AND FOR HELPING US -- IMPROVE THE BILL. X. SB SIX SIX SEVEN IS A BILL WHICH SEEKS TO SUPPORT ALL. OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS THEY WORK TOWARDS MEETING ORG ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING GOALS. WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CAL RECYCLE TO DEVELOP A NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO MEET THE STATE'S ORGANICS. AND RECYCLING REQUIREMENTS RATHER THAN -- FOCUSING ON ORGANICS INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE CAL RECYCLED THE TREASURE TO COORDINATE WITH THE STATE OF NEVADA OREGON AND WASHINGTON. ON INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING TO SUPPORT REGIONAL RECYCLING NEEDS -- TO ALSO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF INTERSTATE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE MARKETS NECESSARY -- TO PLACE THESE. WE HAVE -- TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HERE -- TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT NICK LAPIS IS WITH THE CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA OF COURSE WITH YOUR PERMISSION MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU WERE GONNA PASTAS FOR A MOMENT TO ESTABLISH A FARM WE CAN OF ROLL CALL PLEASE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HERE FRIEDMAN HERE FLORA FLORA HERE CHAU CHOW HERE EGGMAN. EGGMAN HERE GARCIA LIMON MATHIS MCCARTY. MCCARTY HERE MELENDEZ REFUGEE STONE. STONE HERE. CARE WITNESSES UP TO THREE MINUTES APIECE THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC -- WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX SIXTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT WILL HELP THE STATE ACHIEVE ITS AMBITIOUS ORGANICS RECYCLING MANDATES. REDUCE POLLUTION AND CREATE JOBS IN THE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REALLY THE BACKBONE FOR MEETING THE STATE'S SOLID WASTE GOALS -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TODAY IS COMPLYING WITH SB -- THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THAT REQUIRES THE STATE TO DIVERT 75% OF ITS ORGANIC WASTE FROM LANDFILLS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO WE'RE GOING TO SEE A MASSIVE UP TAKEN THE RECYCLING OF ORGANIC WASTE -- THAT'S GOING TO COME AT CONSIDERABLE COST UP TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS -- IF NOT MORE SO THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY -- WE NEED A LOT OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES OUT THERE TO PROVIDE THIS AMOUNT -- OF COMPOST -- AND DEAL WITH THE LEVELS OF ORGANIC BUT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- POTENTIALLY HUNDRED FACILITIES -- AND THEN THERE'S A NEW REQUIREMENT THAT COVER CYCLE IS INCLUDING AND THEIR DRAFT RAGS THAT WERE REVISED LAST WEEK -- FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROCURE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS OF COMPOST PER PERSON -- SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A PRETTY LARGE UNDERTAKING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE DESPERATELY NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE AND WE THINK THIS BILL WILL HELP US GET THERE. IT MOVES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BY PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE FINANCING FOR THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES -- REQUIRING THE STATE TO DEVELOP -- SOME TYPE OF INVESTMENT PLAN -- WAR ASSESSMENT FOR WHAT'S NEEDED FOR THOSE FACILITIES AND THEN ALSO REQUIRES CAL RECYCLED TO GO OUT AND DEVELOP AN INCENTIVE MECHANISMS TO ACCELERATE PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO BRING THOSE FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. CAPTION THE CORPUS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. IN ADDITION TO JOHN COMMENTS ON THE NEED FOR AGAIN X. INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK YOU'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER. THE SECOND HALF OF THIS BILL IS TALKING ABOUT RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SPECIFICALLY PAPER RECYCLING -- IT MIGHT SOUND FAMILIAR SOME MEMBER ADMINS LEGISLATION -- SIR LAID OUT OF SOME MORE VISION OF DEVELOPING IN STATE MARKETS AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE. TO REALLY BRING HOME RECYCLING BRING HOME THE BENEFITS. THIS BILL FALLS IN THE SAME VEIN AND AND BASICALLY TELLS. THE CAL OR CYCLE IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE WORK TOGETHER TO FACILITATE. IN STATE RECYCLING MARKETS FOR PAPER FOR ORGANIC WASTE FOR OTHER MATERIALS IT'S A VERY LOGICAL -- WAY TO MOVE FORWARD AT THE INFECTION POINT RIGHT RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. MICHAEL DEATH WITH THE PRAYER IN MCKINNEY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES AND SUPPORT. JOSIAH YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. NATALIE MAX ON BEHALF OF SEE ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYBODY WISHING TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SEEING NONE WILL GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY. SEEING NONE OF MISTER HUESO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU -- WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM THIRTEEN SB SIX SIXTY SEVEN BY SENATOR HUESO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED EVERY FOR TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN I FRIEDMAN I'VE FLORA FLORA AYE CHAU. CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE LEMOND. MATHIS. MCCARTY AYE MCCARTY AYE MELINDA'SMURATSUCHI STONE STONE AYE. THANK YOU THANK YOU BELIEVE THE ROLE OF SENATOR ALLEN. YOUR NEXT WITH SB. FORTY THREE THANK YOU SO MUCH AROUND HERE MEMBERS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND LIKE TO THINK THEM ALSO FOR THE DETAILED ANALYSIS. HI THIS BILL REQUIRES THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO SUBMIT A REPORT. ON THE FEAST ON THE FEASIBILITY OF PRACTICALITY OF CALCULATING. CARBON INTENSITY OF RETAIL PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE TAX IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FROM A PROGRAM SUCH AS THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN REDUCING EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER THE WIDE ARRAY OF FACTORS INFLUENCING CONSUMER PRICES OFTEN MASKS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT. OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND CONSUMERS ARE UNABLE TO SAVE MONEY BY CHOOSING. I CLIMATE FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVE SO THIS IS THIS IS A STUDY BILL -- THE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT IT DID DID STUDIES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHICH IS -- LOOKING AT ARE THE POSSIBILITY OF OF LITERALLY DOING AWAY WITH OUR SALES AND USE TAX ALTOGETHER. AND REPLACING IT WITH A REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON PRICING MECHANISM BASED ON THE PRODUCTS CARBON INTENSITY. SO THAT'S THE THAT'S WHAT WE BE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING -- BASED ON ON ON ALL THE DATA THAT WOULD THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD COULD PULL TOGETHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING VERY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS. WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THOSE IN OPPOSITION AND TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AYE I DO BELIEVE WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO REACHING CONSENSUS ON LANGUAGE -- I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY MYSELF A SERAPH FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY ALSO I CHRISTY SHOEMAKER FROM FOSSEL FREE CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE THEY'RE HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF SB. FORTY THREE WITNESSES. THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WE APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR ALLEN BOTH FOR THE CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT. SB FORTY THREE IS A STUDY BILL WILL PROVIDE THE STATE WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. I CAN INFORM DISCUSSIONS ON HOW CALIFORNIA MIGHT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EVEN FURTHER. AT THIS POINT WE NEED TO EXPLORE ALL OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW WE CAN ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE MOST EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY AND THE SHOULD INCLUDE EXAMINING THE SALES AND USE TAX IS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM. LAST FALL THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUED A REPORT YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS WHERE HIGHLIGHTS A GLOBAL URGENCY OF BECOMING CARBON NEUTRAL IF NOT CARBON NEGATIVE BY MID CENTURY. IN ORDER TO KEEP OVERALL TEMPERATURES FROM RISING NO MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS THIS IS COMPARED TO PRE INDUSTRIAL LEVELS. THIS REPORT FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOR COUNTRIES COMMITTED TO KEEP TEMPERATURE INCREASES TO WELL BELOW TWO DEGREES. CELSIUS TO AVOID THE MOST CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER ON THE CLIMATE FRONT. WE ALSO NEED TO DO MORE IF YOU WANT TO DO OUR PART AND HELP. ME TO PARIS COMMITMENTS AND FOLLOW THE IPCC REPORT GUIDANCE. WE SEE SENATE BILL FORTY THREE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE VIABILITY INEFFECTIVENESS OF ANOTHER TOOL. THIS TIME FOCUS ON CONSUMERS. THAT WAS A TO HELP US IN THIS EFFORT AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND POTENTIALLY OUTSIDE OF ITS BORDERS. YOU CAN COMPLEMENT. THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED TO HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHETHER CHANGE THE SALES AND USE TAX COULD ALSO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. SO CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRISTINE SHOEMAKER. I'M A MEMBER OF PHILOSOPHY CALIFORNIA I'M A RETIRED PLAN LIKE YOUR BIOLOGIST IMMINENT BOARD MEMBER OF FOSSIL FREE. PUZZLE FOR CALIFORNIA'S A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WITH OVER SEVEN THOUSAND ONLINE SUPPORTERS AND OUR MISSION IS TO WORK TO AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR CLIMATE DAMGING FOSSIL FUELS. AND PROMOTED JUST TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY. THIS BILL FITS WITH OUR MISSION. THE PROBLEM CLIMATE CHANGE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT ARE MADE PUBLIC TALK TO TALK ABOUT THAT IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. WE NEED A FAST DRAW DOWN IN A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY ONE THAT THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS UNDERSTAND WHERE IN THE ECONOMY THE CARBON IS. AND THAT'S FOR CARBON INTENSITY TO TERMINATION COMES IN AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IT NEEDS TO BE STANDARDIZED CONSISTENT AND ACCURATE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY EASY TO DO TO DETERMINE THAT BUT THERE ARE MECHANISMS OUT THERE. AND CARP HAS BASICALLY DONE THIS FOR FUELS IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. CARB STUDYING THE FEASIBILITY OF WHETHER WE COULD LOOK AT THE CARBON INTENSITY OF EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE TAX WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL. PASSING THIS BILL WITH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS ALIKE. THE CALIFORNIA WANTS WHAT'S MADE AND SOLD IN CALIFORNIA TO BE LOW IN CARBON AND ALSO WHAT'S BONDING IN CALIFORNIA TO BE LOW IN CARBON. IT IS A BROAD MESSAGE TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING CARBON. IN ALL THAT YOU DO AND BY. SO WE URGEAN AYE VOTE BECAUSE WE NEED TO MEASURE CARBON LIKE OUR PLAN IT DEPENDS ON IT. BECAUSE INDEED TO HAVE A LIVABLE PLANET IT DOES. SO WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR ALLEN FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL AND ASKING US TO SPEAK AND FOR THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF AN ALLOWING US TO HAVE TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL [inaudible] OKAY. JANET CARDS. FOR BUT OF FORTY THREE FIFTY SILICON VALLEY IN STRONG SUPPORT. TINA GAL YOUR RUTH REZO CENTER WELL BREAKER FOR THREE FIFTY SACRAMENTO IN STRONG SUPPORT. OKAY THANK YOU AS OR ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEAH SO WITH OUR WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I WANT TO FIRST START OUT BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HELP ON ALICE'S STAND FOR THE SENATOR'S OFFICE AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK. I'M TROUBLED HOUSES WE HAD HOPED THAT WE HAD GOTTEN TO A NEUTRAL POSITION IN THE LAST HOUSE -- LITTLE BIT CHANGES HERE -- BUT WE DO WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN REACH AGREEMENT ON A COUPLE OF REMAINING ISSUES -- PRIMARILY AROUND ENSURING THAT THE STUDY EVALUATES AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXISTING CARBON MISSION PROGRAMS IN EVALUATING CARBON INTENSITY AND ENTERING SOME DEFINITIONAL CHANGES SO WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT -- WITH THE ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE THAT THE SENATORS INCLUDING WE WILL GO TO INITIAL POSITION SO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK. THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS SENATOR. ALLEN AND HIS STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL SO FAR MANY MISTRAL COOK I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO SB -- FORTY THREE HOWEVER WE ARE REVIEWING A MOMENT AS THEY COME THROUGH -- AND WE ARE HOPEFUL. THAT WE CAN REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION AT SOME POINT -- OR OPPOSITION HERE IS ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONDUCTED THAT WILL BRING CALIFORNIA TO A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY -- BY TWO OR ARE INTENDED TO BRING CALIFORNIA TO A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SUCH STUDIES IN ARE PRECLUDED FROM DOING A CARBON TAX -- BUT WHAT WE ARE ASSERTING THAT WE DON'T NEED TO FORCE A CARBON TAX STUDY IF THEY'RE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO ACHIEVE THE SAME POLICY GOAL. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE MANUFACTURES HAVING CONTINUE TO BE STRONG PARTNERS IN REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE FOR CAP AND TRADE AND WE CONTINUE TO BE LEADERS IN CREATING ADOPTING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS FOR CLEANER. AND GREENER PRODUCTION. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE STILL OPPOSE BUT WE ARE HOPING TO GETTING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SEEING NOBODY ELSE I'LL TAKE THE BILL NOW THE DISCUSSION TO THE DYESS IF THERE IS ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AS A MEMBER OF THE PARTY THANK YOU AYE AYES I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE I I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE SENATOR SO. THE NOTION OF THIS IS A STUDY AND LOOKING AT THE CARBON TAX AS A POTENTIAL MODEL. YOU MENTIONED THAT IS TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL. IT LOOKING AT THE CURRENT RATE FOR OUR SALES AND USE TAX I GUESS TWO THINGS. ONE IT'S REVENUE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT AS THINGS CHANGE WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY. IT COULD FLUCTUATE AND HOW HOW THAT IMPACTS YOU KNOW EXISTING MONEY GOING. TO OUR STATE FOR SALES AND USE TAXES THAT PAY FOR SCHOOLS AND ROADS IN. PUBLIC SERVICES AND SO FORTH YEAH THE I MEAN THIS IS THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT AS PART OF THE STUDY RIGHT IN THE THE ONE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE A ANY ANY DECREASE. TO PUBLIC REVENUES BOB WHAT WE DO WHEN WE CALL IT NEVER USUALLY TWENTY MAKE SURE THAT THIS IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT USING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE TAXES ON THAT ON THE POPULATION -- BUT BUT THAT WOULD THAT'S IT THAT'S SOMETHING WE LOOK AT AND AND THE YEAH THAT THE FOLKS SETTING IS PART OF THAT THE STUDY. WOULD HAVE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY NET LOSS IN PUBLIC REVENUES SO IF IT IS REVENUE NEUTRAL AND THERE'S NO INCREASED. TO PAY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS LIKE WE DO WITH CAP AND TRADE. OR TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR THEN HOW DOES THAT IMPACT. THE ENTITIES OUT THERE WHO YOU'RE SEEKING TO TO MAKE A CHANGE. THERE COULD BE -- THEN WHEN ONE POSSIBILITY WOULD BE -- KIND OF A MECHANISM WHERE YOU WOULD TWEAK IT OVER TIME WHERE YOU COULD INCREASE -- THE TAX TO A CERTAIN PRODUCT IF THERE WAS IT IF THERE WAS A YOU KNOW A DECREASE TO PUBLIC REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH -- YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE CHANGE SO THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY BUT YOU HAVE TO CREATE SOME SORT OF MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THERE WASN'T A LOT BUT IT'S IDEA TO HAVE A PRODUCT CHANGE ITS STRUCTURE ITS IMPACT IS THAT. IS THAT KIND OF WHAT THE GOAL IS LIKE WE I THINK THE GOAL LIKE WITH CAP AND TRADE IS. TO IS TO LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT. OF OF MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT THAT WE DO A BETTER JOB OF BUILDING IN THE THE TRUE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. CERTAIN TYPES OF PRODUCTS -- AND IT OVER TIME WE COULD YOU KNOW AYE AYES BEHAVIORS SHIFT. WE WOULD HAVE. TO AS YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED TRADE RIGHT IN THAT THEY DID THEY GETS. YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE GET UP THE INTO WE KEPT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF THE PRODUCT -- BUT YOU WITH THE BILL THESE IS OPEN ENDED SO AS TO ALLOW FOR SOME. TAX EXPERTS TO REALLY SPEND SOME TIME DIGGING INTO THE POSSIBILITIES AND COME UP WITH A MECHANISM THAT -- THAT THEY THAT THEY THINK WOULD BE FAIR AND AND THAT WOULD ADDRESS. THIS ISSUE OVER OF POTENTIAL REVENUE LOSS. AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE. SO WHAT WE WE DON'T WE ARE WE'RE NOT DELINEATING A PARTICULAR PATH HERE -- BUT WERE CONVENING EXPERTS. TO YOU KNOW. TO TO YOU KNOW TO TO TO TO LOOK AT I HAVE A WHAT YOU KNOW IT IT IT IT IT BUT BURKE WHICH TO WEAR DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES ME ME ME LEAD US. I'M NOT TRYING TO BE. NO BIG HERE BUT WE WE REALLY DO WANT TO LEAVE IT OPEN ENDED SO THAT EXPERTS CAN SPEND SOME TIME REALLY GRAPPLING WITH. WITH THESE THINGS OKAY NOT WHAT WE NOW I WILL SAY. THE BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE MADE AND IT WILL. WHAT WE'RE REALLY NOT FOCUSING ON TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME WAY? TO TO ASSESS THE CARBON INTENSITY IN A PRODUCT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'VE GONE WITH OUR DISCUSSIONS -- SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'VE WE'VE MOVED TO WET MY MY ORIGINAL VISION WAS THIS. KIND OF THOUGHT WHAT IF WE WERE JUST LITERALLY REPLACE THE THE SALES AND USE TAX TO THE REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON TAX. ON THIS COULD HELP US MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION BUT WHERE THE BILL IS NOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE WORK WE'VE DONE WITH OPPOSITION -- WE'RE NOW IN A PLACE WHERE WHERE WHERE WORLD JUST LASKIN REALLY LOOKING AT HOW WE MIGHT GO ABOUT PRICING CARBON INTENSITY ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMER PRODUCTS. AND SO. IT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING ARE ARE OBSOLETE ON POINT THERE IS A LITTLE PREMATURE GIVEN WHERE THE BILL IS IN GIVEN --% CAM HOW IT'S MOVING RIGHT NOW BUT I I THINK THAT THE DISCUSSION WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE. IF WE DECIDE THAT THERE REALLY IS A A MECHANISM FOR FOR PROPERLY PRICING CARBON INTENSITY IF WE WANT TO ADOPT THIS MODEL. HAS A STATE ON THE LINE. OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER ON I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS LONG LINE OF OF THAT SO MEMBER MCCARTY JUST IN. JUST AND LIKE YOU KNOW IS THE GRAND SCHEME TO PUT IT HARD TO CAP AND TRADE IS IT WOULD BE A WHOLE SEPARATE SYSTEM DO WE KNOW -- AND THEN I GUESS THE THE IDEA OF MARKET BASED SYSTEMS LIKE THAT I MEAN. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH DECREASED WE'VE SEEN WE'RE CHARGING PEOPLE TO TO POLLUTE BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS CHANGE BEHAVIOR. IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE PRICE OF A POLLUTION -- BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION LIKE TO ASK THE DATE IS -- WHAT CERTAIN TYPES OF PRODUCTS IT WAS IT HOW EXPENSIVE ARE THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN BE -- UNDER CONSIDERATION IN THIS OR IS AT ALL IS THAT ALL LEFT TO TO THE AGENCY DECIDE. ARE. LARGELY IT'S IT'S LESS EASY TO SIDE AND WHERE WE ARE -- AND WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE KEEPING AN OPEN AND ON PURPOSE FOR THAT FOR YOU BECAUSE WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE FLEXIBILITY -- YOU KNOW. TO TO TO BE ABLE. TO TO YES TO TO DO THIS WORK RIGHT AT ME THE OTHER DAY -- THE THE ECONOMY WILL CHANGE PRODUCTS WILL CHANGE THINGS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE -- WE WE WE WANTED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO THEM. IS IT JUST JUST THINGS THAT ARE PROCESS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING OF FOOD ITEMS MIGHT BE TALK RED APPLE RIGHT NO TALKING ABOUT -- WE'RE WE'RE TENER ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT DISPOSABLE DIAPER BUT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. YOUR THAT ANYTHING IN ANYTHING IT'S SUBJECT TO THE SALES TAX AYE BUT I GUESS -- IN THE END OF THE DAY I KNOW THAT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY VERY COMPLICATED THING AND WHAT I'VE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THE SENATE SIDE. MY AS A BILL IS MOVING THROUGH IS IT IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT WE LOVE THE CONCEPT OF DOING THIS IT ON THE LINE. BUT THAT THE FEASIBILITY IS JUST SO OUT OF CONTROL THAT SO DIFFICULT TO PROPERLY PRICE THESE THINGS THAT JUST FROM A PRACTICALITY PERSPECTIVE IT IS NOT WORTH DOING. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE YEAH WE'RE CONSIDERING THE IDEA WE'RE LOOKING INTO A LITTLE BIT. AND IF IF IT BUT IT BUT YOU DO UFC RIGHT I MEAN THESE ISSUES HAVE COME UP AS WE AS WE'VE BEEN MOVING ALONG AND THEY MAY PROVE THIS WAY TOO DIFFICULT THE JUST THE A MAY BE A GREAT IDEA BUT DOES NOT A GOOD THING. TO DO FROM A FROM OF IMPLEMENTATION PERSPECTIVE. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE I SILLY WHEN NOT IN USE IN PURSUING IT ANY FURTHER BUT I DO WANT TO GIVE IT A LOOK I THINK. WE OUGHT TO GET SOME EXPERTS TO REALLY SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT THIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW -- BUT WE KNOW WE WE HAVE ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AFTER DRESSERS AND YOU THE CAPITATE SYSTEM IS. MUCH SMALLER THAN THE SALES TAX. SYSTEM. NOW WE CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE HERE IF WE DO IT RIGHT BUT IF IT PROVES THAT THAT IS JUST THE INVISIBLE IT'S NOT WORTH PURSUING. IT IS THE CONCEPT THEN THAT IT WOULD REPLACE SALES TAX. THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL IDEA YES THAT'S IDEA. TO REPLACE IT AND IF YOU DO YOU DO YOU DO YOU REPLACE IT WITH THE WITH THE REVENUE NEUTRAL -- PRICING TAX BASED ON CARBON INTENSITY BUT AS I SAY RIGHT NOW IT'S ONLY. ALL WE'RE DOING NOW IS IS GETTING THEM TO LOOK AT CARBON A DUNE ASSESSMENT OF CARBON INTENSITY. AND IT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD TOWARD YUP TOWARD MOVING TOWARDS AND I GUESS IT IS SOMETHING WE REALLY TO SAY WE WANT TO DO. IT THEN TOOK THEN IF I CAN JUST ASK BECAUSE WE'RE THERE'S THERE'S ALSO BEEN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MOVING FROM A SALES TAX MODEL TO A SERVICE TAX MODEL BECAUSE SO MUCH MORE OF OUR ECONOMY IS BASED ON THE SERVICE INDUSTRY NOW. SO WITH THAT ALSO THEN APPLIED. TO SERVICES RENDERED. WE'RE LOOK THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS -- RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT SALES TAX SYSTEM SO WE WOULD HAVE TO CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE GOT THERE IF THAT WAS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WAS WAS GOING. AS I AY ALL WE'REDOING WITH THIS IS IS STUDYING AN ASSESSMENT -- A COULD YOU WHATEVER DATA COMES OUT OF THAT ASSESSMENT COULD THEN BE FIT INTO WHATEVER PLAN WE HAVE WITH REGARDS TO MOVING FORWARD WITH A SALES OR SERVICES TAX SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY HOW TO SAY FOR MY PART IT'S A BIG BOLD IDEA BUT WE HAVE A MAJOR CRISIS AND SO. I WOULD WANT TO TAKE ANY BIG BOLD IDEAS OFF THE TABLE BEFORE WE'VE EVEN GIVEN THEM CONSIDERATIONS ALL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY -- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I JUST APPRECIATE -- PURSUE THE GOOD QUESTIONS THEY'RE ALL GREAT I MEAN I I YOU KNOW AND I I KNEW THAT I DON'T HAVE AS SPECIFIC ANSWERS IN THAT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT RIGHT THE BILL IS IS A NECESSITY TO STUDY AND WE'RE WE'RE FOR HOW. TO GET. GET ALL THESE ISSUES ANSWERED BUT I I DO WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK THE SUPPORTERS AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK -- THE FOLKS IN OPPOSITION YOU'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH OUR STAFF AND OUR OFFICE I I'M I'VE I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAMBER THAT THERE. ARE VERY ACHINGLY CLOSE TO BEING NEUTRAL -- THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTIC AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIM CA AND OTHERS TO TO TO GET THIS TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN -- WE CAN ALL FEEL GOOD ABOUT JUST LEARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE WHERE WE MIGHT WANT TO GO. YOU KNOW WAY MOVING INTO THE FUTURE -- SO WITH THAT I I THINK IT MERITS ARE OUR EXPLORATION OUR OUR ASSESSMENT OR STUDY AND I RESPECT FOR US IN A VOTE THANK YOU. OUR LOCAL POLICE. SORRY WE HAVE A MOTION. THE REMOTE SECOND NOW WITH US FOR A LOOK. ITEM THREE SB FORTY THREE BY SENATOR ALLEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO CHAU CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE LIMóN. MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY AYE MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ BROUGHT TO G.. STONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. OUR NEXT AUTHOR IS SENATOR SKINNER WITH SB. FORTY NINE THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- SB. FORTY NINE WOULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR OUR FOR ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS WHICH MANY OF US HAVE RIGHT ON OUR PHONE OR ON OUR SMART METER AT HOME OR ON THE THERMOSTAT IN OUR HOUSE. OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS -- SO WE NOTE NOW THAT THERE'S LOTS OF APPLIANCES ON THE MARKET THAT ARE CALLED SMART APPLIANCES THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE HOOKED UP ON YOUR PHONE. TO BE ABLE TO TURN THEM ON AND OFF REMOTELY TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE SETTINGS ALL OF THAT. BUT RIGHT NOW. WE BECAUSE OF THE STATUTE EXISTING STATUTE FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION IT ENABLES ENERGY COMMISSION ONLY TO SET APPOINT STANDARDS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AND THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS RESTRICTED TO THAT WHICH IS COST EFFECTIVE IN THE COST EFFECTIVE IS A NARROW DEFINITION. AND THE CREW IT MUST BE ONLY THOSE THINGS THAT DIRECTLY REDUCE THE INDIVIDUAL RATE PAYERS COST. NOW WE KNOW THAT WITH AS WE ARE EMBARKING ON GETTING MORE AND MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY IN OUR CURRENT GRID 50% AND THEN A 100%. IT IS VERY OPTIMAL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY WHEN IT IS GENERATED AND RENEWABLE ENERGY IS NOT NECESSARILY GENERATED. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SO IF WE CAN MANAGE OUR DEMANDS WHICH THESE. APPLICATIONS AND SMART APPLIANCES WOULD ALLOW US. TO TO UTILIZE THAT ENERGY MAXIMIZE IT WHEN IT'S BEING GENERATED. WE WILL GET FAR MORE BANG FOR OUR BACK WE WILL HAVE PERHAPS NEED. TO BUILD LESS POWER PLANTS EVEN RENEWABLE ONCE AND FOR SURE WE WOULD REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON HER PLANTS WHICH ARE STILL PRIMARILY. POWERED BY NATURAL GAS SO BASICALLY SB FORTY NINE WOULD JUST ALLOW THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO SET STANDARDS SO THE FIRST SMART APPLIANCES ADDITIONALLY. SO THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF THOSE SMART APPLIANCES FOR AN ENERGY DEMAND TO PURPOSE. AND I HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT FROM HOME CONNECT AND FROM THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND RESPONSE COUNCIL OKAY GREAT THANK GAIL. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LILLIAN MARVIS I'M A GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER -- FOR CONNECTS -- CAN ACT AS A RESIDENTIAL DEMAND RESPONSE SOFTWARE COMPANY BASED OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE THAT WE SUPPORT SB. FORTY NINE JUST AS SENATOR SKINNER'S HAND AS MORE RENEWABLES COME ONLINE IS CALIFORNIA STRIVES TO MEET IT SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS. IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE DEMAND OF ELECTRICITY MATCHES WHEN NOT SUPPLY IS CLEAN AND PREDOMINATELY GENERATED BY RENEWABLE ENERGY. WHAT SB FORTY NINE DOES IS TAKE ANY HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE AND MAKES ACT DEVICE SMARTER AND GREAT CONNECTED SO THAT IT CAN RESPOND IN REAL TIME TO THE CONDITIONS ON THE GRAD? THOSE CONDITIONS AREN'T. SHEREEN WHEN THERE'S HIGH PROPORTION OF RENEWABLES BUT IT ALSO SHARES WHEN PRICES ARE LOW SO THAT CONSUMERS ARE USING ELECTRICITY WHEN IT'S CHEAP BEST. WHERE OWN CONNECT IS MOST EXCITED ABOUT SB FORTY NINE IS THAT IT TAKES ANY RESIDENTIAL UTILITY CUSTOMER? AND HELPS THEM BE A PART OF CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. OUR HOMES WITH THE SMART DEVICES CAN HELP INTEGRATE RENEWABLES ONTO THE GRAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THEIR ANIMAL -- REPRESENTING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL AS YOU KNOW AND SENATOR ALREADY SAID. CALIFORNIA HAS AN ABUNDANCE OF ENERGY THE QUESTION IS REALLY AND HOW THAT ENERGY EBBS AND FLOWS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. SO BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS OBVIOUSLY MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR USING CONSUMER SIDE -- DEMAND MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP RENEWABLES AND ENERGY BASICALLY INTEGRATE BETTER INTO THE GRID -- AND SO WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU IS ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU TO CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. BRENT AND ALSO SIERRA CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. JAY ZIEGLER THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. VERY GOOD WELL NOW GO UP TO THE DICE AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN FOR THE SAKE OF ASKING A QUESTION -- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE SOCIAL COST OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS HOW IS A BALLOT UNDER THE CDC'S ANALYSIS WHEN WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT CALIFORNIANS CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD? DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION -- SO THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. SEE I CAN GO TO THE EXACT PAGE. THE BASICALLY ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER. THE SOCIAL COST OF GREENHOUSE GASES. BUT IT FIRST HAS TO MAKE A FINDING. THAT THE THE APPLIANCE STANDARDS THAT CREATE THIS FLEXIBLE DEMAND DO NOT UNREASONABLY OR UNNECESSARILY IMPACT. THE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS ASPECT THAT'S THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THE EXISTING STATUTE OF THE COMMISSION OR ALSO THE ABILITY OF I INDIVIDUAL REPAIRS TO BUY THESE COMPLIANT APPLIANCES. SO. THE WAY WE'VE STRUCTURED THE BILL IS THAT THAT PROVISION WOULD NOT SUPERSEDE THE EXISTING COST EFFECTIVENESS. NOW THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT WHAT IS MEANT BY SOCIAL COSTS WE ARE WORKING RIGHT NOW. WITH THE SIMPLY ENERGY TO COME UP THE DEFINITION AND WE ARE. OBVIOUSLY SOCIAL COST COULD MEAN A LOT OF THINGS BUT WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN. IS HAVING IT BE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS IT DOESN'T RIGHT NOW THE STATUTE IS MORE SPECIFIC TO AN INDIVIDUAL RATE PAYER. BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THINGS SUCH AS AVOIDED TRANSMISSION OR AVOIDED NEW INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE NEW GENERATION THOSE ARE COSTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT ALL RATE PAYERS. SO THE TYPE OF DEFINITION WE'RE LOOKING AT IS STILL WITH IN THAT RATE PAYER SPACE VERSUS YOU KNOW -- AN UNLIMITED [inaudible] THE QUESTION. WHAT IS ONE OF THE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS ON THE GLENDALE CITY COUNCIL -- I VOTED TO ALLOCATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- FROM THE CITY IN THE UTILITY TO MAKE GLENDALE THE FIRST CITY IN CALIFORNIA TO BE COMPLETELY SMART METER ON THE WATER AND THE POWER SIGNED. AND ONE OF THE PROMISES THAT WAS MADE AT THE TIME FROM THE UTILITY FOR THE INVESTMENT WAS THAT WE BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SMART APPLIANCES. THAT THE RATE PAYERS EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS THIS INITIAL -- ACOSTA THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO BEAR IN THE END WE WOULD SAVE MONEY BECAUSE WE BE ABLE TO DEMAND MANAGEMENT PEOPLE COULD. TELL THEIR APPLIANCES TO RUN WHEN UP POWER WAS CHEAPEST I NONE OF THAT EVER CAME TO FRUITION AT THIS POINT AND NOW THE CITY'S LOOKING AT RE POWER A GAS POWER PLANT. AND THAT DEMAND MANAGEMENT IS NO WHERE IN THE EQUATION BECAUSE THAT FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT ONLINE EVEN THOUGH THE SMART METERS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING IT ON THEIR APPS TO DO IT. NONE OF THAT'S REALLY BEEN PUT TOGETHER YET AND CERTAINLY THE PRICING HASN'T BEEN INSTITUTED. SO THIS IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP TO EMPOWER REPAIRS. TO SAVE MONEY -- THE WITH THE INVESTMENTS THAT THEY'VE MADE THROUGH SMART METERS AND ALSO THROUGH BUYING APPLIANCES THAT ARE SMART METER READY SO I THINK THIS BILL IS GOING TO GO A LONG WAY IN HELPING PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMING FORWARD WITH THE BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT OF TODAY. THANK YOU I DO WE HAVE A MOTION SO MOVED. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WAIVER ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM FOR SB FORTY NINE BY SENATOR SKINNER THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I FLORA. FLORA NOT VOTING CHAU. EGGMAN HI EGGMAN AYE GARCIA. GARCIA I LOW MOAN. LIMON AYE MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY THANK MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ. MURATSUCHI [inaudible] STONE. FOUR ONE FOUR ONE WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR THANK YOU. FIVE ONE SORRY OUR NEXT SENATOR IS -- SENATOR DODD. WITH. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WELCOME SENATOR AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU'RE WELCOME TO PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- SP TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NATIVE CULTURE. TO ESTABLISH THE MINISTER IN INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAM. SB TWO FIVE THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE PROGRAM TO OPTIMIZE WILDLIFE HABITAT WILL SUPPORTING THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE THROUGH INCENTIVES IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS MOVED WELL. THEIR CULTURE IS A MAJOR INDUSTRY HOWEVER THE MANAGEMENT DECISION THE CONSERVATION PRACTICES OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS CAN ALSO DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY PROVIDE REQUISITE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. IT OFFER -- SOCIAL BENEFITS THE PURPOSE OF INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS WHO WANT. TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE WILDLIFE FRIENDLY IMPROVEMENTS ON THEIR LAND. A PART OF FUTURE APPROPRIATION THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS WHO CREATE THESE -- BENEFITS -- SB TWO FIFTY THREE CLEARLY INSTRUCTS THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAY OF CULTURE IT SURE THE INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM. COMPLIMENTS AND NOT SO PLANTS ANY OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS CONTRARY TO WHAT IS SUGGESTED BY CAL CANCER LATE OPPOSITION. I ALSO WANT TO POINTOUT THE CAL KIDS SUGGESTION THAT SB TWO FIVE THREE WALL OFF ANY PARTICULAR FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. SIMPLY BECAUSE IT CREATES COMPETITION FOR OTHER PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY A CAL KIA IS FRANKLY NONSENSE. DETERMINING WHO GETS WHAT FUNDING IS THE LEGISLATURE'S JOB BASED ON OUR PRIORITIES EACH YEAR IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IN CONCLUSION I COMMITTEE YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN THE COMMITTEE THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE TO ADDRESS HOW WE ESTABLISH. PRIORITIZATION OF THE GRANT PROGRAM SB TWO FIVE THREE IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WHICH IS HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU WITNESSES PLEASE STAND UP. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY THREE MY NAME IS JAY ZIEGLER AND I'M THAT DIRECTOR POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. OF CALIFORNIA'S PRACTICALLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION ACRES MORE THAN DEDICATED TO WORKING FARMS AND RANCHES. ACROSS THE STATE THESE WORKING LANDS PROVIDE CRITICALLY NEEDED OPEN SPACE AND HABITAT -- THOSE HABITAT NEEDS ARE ACTUALLY GROWING -- MORE SEVERE AS CLIMATE CHANGE -- CHANGES -- HABITAT PATTERNS -- AROUND US THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- IT IS SENATOR DODD NOTES -- HIS LEGISLATION WOULD ESTABLISH A SPECIFIC PROGRAM TO ALLOW AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS WHO WANT TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE CONSERVATION IMPROVEMENTS THEIR LANDS -- IN KERRY COSTS -- FOR WATER AND ENERGY -- WHICH ADD TO THE WORKING LANDSCAPE COSTS OF AGRICULTURE -- INTO THEIR LARGER EQUATION -- SO -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND THAT WOULD BE CREATED AND SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR WILDLIFE FRIENDLY FENCING. TO ALLOW FOR WILDLIFE MOVEMENT FLOODING OF RICE FIELDS FOR MIGRATORY BIRD HABITAT -- AND SUCH PRACTICES IS GROWING HEAD ROSE -- TO BENEFIT POLLINATORS. IN RECENT YEARS AND ESPECIALLY DURING THE DROUGHT WE SOUGHT TO BUILD DELIVERY OF ON FARM CONSERVATION PRACTICES DECLINE AT A PRECIPITOUS LEVEL. IN FACT -- IN THE HEART OF THE DROUGHT I ON PRIVATE LANDS THE ONLY HABITAT THAT WAS PROVIDED CAME FROM -- PROGRAM FUNDING FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION SERVICE OR PROGRAMS OPERATED BY NON PROFITS -- IN CALIFORNIA TO THE EVENT THAT CRITICAL NEED -- FOR HABITAT DIRECTED ACTIONS ON PRIVATE LANDS IS GROWING MORE SEVERE -- AS AS SAID AS THE MONTHS AND YEARS ARE PASSING. MORE RESOURCES AND TOOLS -- ARE NEEDED -- FOR CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO DO S. CLIMATE CHANGE -- AND ON FARM PRACTICES ARE REALLY GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL AND PROTECTING -- THE QUALITY OF HABITAT FOR FISH -- WILDLIFE MIGRATORY BIRDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE THANK AS SENATOR DODD FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN THE US AND ASPER AYE VOTE ON SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITH THE TEAR. HI MY NAME IS KAREN BERMAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS -- THE NINETY SIX OUR CITIES -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CONSERVATION ISSUES ON FARMLAND SINCE THE DUST BOWL SO FOR OVER SEVENTY FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN ALL PARTNERING WITH LANDOWNERS TO AND DO BETTER IS AS WELL AS COMMUNITIES -- THE BIGGEST TOOL THAT WE'VE HAD AS BEEN THE NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION SERVICE BOTH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY PROVIDE. AND ESPECIALLY THE FUNDING THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE THE EQUIPPED FOR GRAHAM -- THAT IS IT'S IT GREATLY -- ASSISTED US IN BEING ABLE TO REDUCE NON POINT SOURCE POLLUTION I'M SOIL EROSION SEDIMENTATION CONSERVATION OF AND PROMOTING CONSERVATION OF GROUND AND SURFACE WATERS ENERGY AND I HAVE BENEFITING OUT AT RISK SPECIES -- OF WILD WILD LIFE AND AND CREATING THEIR HABITAT -- WE REALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND BECAUSE HAVING THE ANALOG TO THE NRCS WOULD GIVE US A WHOLE NOTHER SET OF TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO AND DO BETTER ON FARMLAND AS WE KNOW WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ISSUES THAT ARE FACING US. WE NEED ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN GET -- AND DAD. HAVING A AN ANALOG TO THE ENTER CS WOULD PROVIDE A WHOLE ADDITIONAL SET OF TOOLS THAT CAN CAN HELP US GET TO THESE GOALS -- WE DO APPRECIATE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY OUT CDFA AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THOSE WITH OUR CITIES ALL OVER THE STATE -- BUT WE THERE'S REALLY A LOT MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO IN THERE'S A LOT MORE INPUT NOT MORE PRACTICES THAT WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT -- SO WE REALLY SEE TWO FIFTY THREE AS A WAY FOR FARMERS SAID IMPLEMENT COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES AT THE EXISTING CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE PROGRAM. AND WE REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE ALL THE GOALS THAT THEY HAVE FOR THEIR OWN FARMLAND. AND THANK YOU SENATOR DODD FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS -- THIS EFFORT. HE WAS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MARK FRANCE MAKER FOR THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY OPEN SPACE THIRTY INSTRUCTS PORT. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE. OKAY SO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WHAT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. HELLO JIMMY MERYL WITH THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE IN AGRICULTURE NETWORK A MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- WE ARE A COALITION OF SUSTAINABLE IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATIONS AND FORMER LEADERS. AND WE ARE REGULARLY SEEKING RESOURCES FOR FARMERS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE -- SO IT'S NOT. WE DON'T LOOK FORWARD TO BEING IN THIS PARTICULAR POSITION WITH THE BILL -- BUT WE'VE BEEN SEEKING WHAT WE THINK ARE SOME PRETTY COMMONSENSE AMENDMENTS BUT JUST HAVEN'T MADE THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAD HOPED BY NOW. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED SB TWO FIVE THREE DOES NOT MAKE CLEAR HOW THE NEWLY PROPOSED ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS COMPLIMENTARY NOT DUPLICATIVE. OF EXISTING CLAIMANTS MIGHT AGRICULTURE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WE HAD PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING SCIENCE ADVISORY PANEL THAT OVERSEES -- CITY AFFAIRS PROGRAMS. SUGGEST HOW TO PURSUE THE PRESENT STREAMLINING COORDINATED APPLICATION PROCESSES FOR FARMERS. SO WE DON'T PRESENT THEM WITH OVERLY COMPLEX IN BURDENS AND APPLICATION SYSTEMS -- AND THAT AMENDMENT WAS NOT A TAKEN FORWARD WE ALSO SUGGESTED CLARIFYING THAT THE INFORMAL FARMING INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON WILDLIFE HABITAT AND NOT TO PLAY COULD HAVE OF SOME OF THE PRACTICES ARE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE CLAIM IT'S MINOR CULTURE PROGRAMS. AND WE WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE NEWLY PROPOSED PROGRAM IS NOT INTENDED AS AN UMBRELLA AND IT AND LENDS BY WHICH ALL PRACTICES MUST MEET. WE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT CURRENT PRACTICES MADE ELIGIBLE BY THE INFORMAL FARMING CENTER PROGRAMMER NOT DUPLICATIVE OF THOSE PRACTICES. ALREADY ELIGIBLE UNDER THE CLAIM IT'S MINOR CULTURE PROGRAM. WE SUPPORT ADICIONAL RESOURCES FOR FARMERS -- THE CURRENT CLAIMS FOR AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS AREN'T BIG ENOUGH WE HAVE WE CAN APPRECIATE THAT -- BUT WE THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF A COORDINATED EFFORT -- BUT REALLY GET SACKED ENHANCED RESOURCES -- WE LIKE TO AVOID CREATING CONFUSION ON THE GROUND WITH FARMERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. A COMPLIMENTARY SET OF TECHNICAL FINANCIAL AND RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR FARMERS WERE INTERESTED IN CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SEEING NONE WILL MOVE BACK TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SOME OF THE REAL AMOUNT IS HAVE DINNER QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR WANTED TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS ARE -- YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE MON -- WE HAVE. HAD SEVERAL CONSULTATIONS -- WITH CAL CAN IN THE PROCESS -- WE THINK THAT -- THE ONE OF THEIR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS IS -- IT WOULD PROVIDE SORT OF DETAIL DIRECTION -- NOT COMMONLY FOUND IN LEGISLATION BUT WE THINK WE CAN RESOLVE -- HOW TO ENSURE -- THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS STREAMLINED AND NOT DUPLICATE I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO CREATE. A CALIFORNIA ANALOG -- TO THE INNER CS PROGRAMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND CANDIDLY PROGRAMS THAT WORK BETTER FOR SMALLER FARMERS AND FOR SPECIALTY CROP FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA -- THAT ARE NOT WELL TAILORED IN A FEDERAL PROGRAM TO THE STATES NEEDS FOR PROVIDING HABITAT ON AGRICULTURAL LAND SO I THINK THAT -- WE HAVE A DIALOGUE GOING I THINK THAT WE CAN ADDRESS -- MOST OF THESE CONCERNS -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONTINUE DIALOGUE. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE. OKAY -- THANK YOU BRING THE BILL FOR IT I KNOW YOU'RE MOVING ON TO AGRICULTURE NEXT AND I THINK A LOT OF THESE ISSUES WILL BE HASHED OUT -- IN THAT COMMITTEE SO I'LL BE ABLE -- TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND HOPE TO SEE IT BEFORE THANK YOU AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE. THANK YOU. WITH THE MOTION WE DO. OKAY THAT'S FOR ROLL CALL PLEASE. I TO MATE SB TWO FIFTY THREE BY SENATOR DODD THE MOTION IS TO PASS A REFER TO THE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE FLORA FLOOR I'D CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE ALONE. LIMON AYE MATHIS. MATHIS I MCCARTY. MELENDEZ WHERE. THIRTY STONE. SIX ZERO SIX WAS THE ROLE OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT UP WE HAVE SENATOR STERN WITH SB. SIX THIRTEEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY CENTER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST I JUST WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK DONE BY YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON THIS. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGIES AND OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE BUT VERY RARELY DO WE FOCUS ON THE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES -- IN THE FOOD SECTOR -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE DOING SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED WORK IN THE WORLD -- WHEN IT COMES TO GROWING OUR FOOD SUSTAINABLY IN MANNERS THAT REDUCE CARBON OR EVEN SEQUESTER THAT CARBON? AND I THINK IT'S TIME THE STATE ACTUALLY DID THE MATH AND LOOKED AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACT OF THE FOOD WE BUY FOR OURSELVES AND I THINK ONCE WE GET TO SOME OF THE TRUTH OF THAT MATH -- WILL REALIZE THAT THERE ARE pTO FEED OURSELVES BUT ALSO -- AND LOWER THE STATE'S CARBON FOOTPRINT AT THE SAME TIME AND HOPEFULLY IN A MANNER THAT -- INCENTIVIZE IS OUR OUR GROWERS IN OUR FARMERS TO KEEP DOING THE GOOD WORK THEY'RE DOING -- SO THAT'S THE SIMPLE THRUST THE BILL BUT I'M HAPPY TO DIG INTO ANY QUESTIONS -- DETAILS AND I'VE GOT SOMEONE MUCH SHARPER THAN I I NICK FASCIOLA WITH THE DIRECTOR WHO IS THE DIRECTOR CARBON PROJECTS AT THREE DEGREES TO TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE NUANCES TO CARBON INVENTORYING OR WHAT REALLY GOES INTO A REPORT CARD FOR THE STATE BUT I'LL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SO DID YOU WANT ME WITNESSES WITNESS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. TO SPEAK DURING IT MIGHT WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY IS THAT RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU VENTURE. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- AND EXPRESS YOUR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER AND THE DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE PROJECTS AT THREE DEGREES SAN FRANCISCO BASED BE CORPORATION THAT HELPS CORPORATE UTILITIES INC AND THE CUSTOMERS. TO TAKE URGENT ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH CARBON MARKETS -- WE'VE ALSO BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES FOR RESTAURANTS -- THAT INCLUDE THE SCOPE THREE LIFECYCLE EMISSIONS FROM THE PRODUCTION AND ACQUISITION. OF INGREDIENTS SERVED AT THE RESTAURANT. I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL SIX THIRTEEN TO REQUIRED THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO CREATE AND PUBLISH. ON ITS INTERNET WEBSITE A METHODOLOGY FOR STATE AGENCY DECIMATED FOOD RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS PROVIDED. AND WOULD REQUIRE STATE AGENCY TO USE THIS METHODOLOGY TO PREPARE ITS ESTIMATE IS ESTIMATE OF THOSE EMISSIONS. BY TESTING A OR B. WITH DEVELOPMENT OF METHODOLOGY WHICH CAN RELY ON AN ABUNDANCE OF EXISTING RESEARCH AND LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS OF FOOD. SO THAT STATE AGENCIES CAN INCLUDE FOOD EMISSIONS WITHIN THE STATE AGENCY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REPORT CARD. SB SIX THIRTEEN COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THIS TO MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE OBJECTIVES. FOR ANY GAPS IN THE SCIENCE BETWEEN CONVENTIONAL AND MORE PROGRESSIVE CLIMATE BENEFICIAL FOOD SYSTEMS THIS BILL COULD SERVE TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE FURTHER LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT STUDIES ON THESE RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS. THE NEW SCIENCE IN TURN CAN BE FOLDED INTO METHODOLOGY REVISIONS THAT WOULD FURTHER SPUR THE STATE'S VENDORS TO UTILIZE FOOD PRODUCTION SYSTEMS THAT HARNESS THESE PROGRESSIVE PRACTICES. OF THE FORTY SOMETHING RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED A GREENHOUSE GAS ASSESSMENT FROM THREE DEGREES WE'VE OBSERVED A FAIR AMOUNT OF ENGAGEMENT BY THE RESTAURANT OWNERS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR REDUCTIONS. WE OFTEN RECEIVE SUCH QUESTIONS AS IS GRASS FED BEEF LESS GREENHOUSE GAS INTENSIVE THAN FEEDLOT BEEF. OR DID YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE LOCAL OYSTERS WE PURCHASE FROM TAMALES BAY THAT ARE SUSTAINABLY HARVESTED. WHILE WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ON THE ACTUAL GREENHOUSE GAS SAVINGS FROM ONE SYSTEM OVER ANOTHER. I BRING THIS UP TO ILLUSTRATE THE TYPE OF THINKING THAT HAS SPURRED BY ASSESSING THE LIFECYCLE EMISSIONS. FROM FOOD PRODUCTION. WHEN THE STATE'S VENDORS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS LEVEL TRANSPARENCY IT IS LIKELY TO ENGAGE MANY THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS AROUND ALTERNATIVE FOODS PROCUREMENT WITH LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS INTENSITIES? THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON SIX THIRTEEN AND THANK SENATOR STERN FOR ALL DURING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU FOR ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. RATED ALSO AS THE ACT OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANYBODY HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SOME NUMBER EGGMAN. THANK YOU -- SINCE IT. SO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT FOOD AND IT'S CONCEPTION. THE FULL LIFECYCLE THE FULL LIFE CYCLE FROM GROWING ALL THE WAY TO OUR PLACE IN THE STATE CAPITAL. WITH THE READ WITH THE WITH THE GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING A BETTER OR REDUCING IT OR THERE'S NO MANDATE FOR REDUCTION IN HERE BUT WE WE FEEL LIKE IF WE HAVE A MORE ACCURATE INVENTORY WE'RE GONNA HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SAY. FRIENDS IT'S A D. G. S. OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO BUY. FOOD. FOR THIS THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE FRIENDS AND AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE BY LOWER CARBON FOODS A PRODUCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR SOMETHING ELSE WHERE -- YOU KNOW GIVING THEM THAT INFORMATION WE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GONNA MAKE SMARTER CHOICES BECAUSE THE OVERALL MANDATE IS. TO REDUCE CARBON SO. TO TRY TO BE AS THOROUGH AS WE CAN ALL THE WAY UPSTREAM WELL HELLO. BUT HOW WILL WE KNOW OUT OF COSTS. FOR OKAY SO I MEAN THE THE MOST ACCURATE DATA WE CAN POSSIBLY GET OBVIOUSLY IS IN STATE WHERE WE HAVE CONTROL ALL THE WAY OVER THE SOURCE AND YOU CAN GO TO A FARM IN OR STAND THEIR PRACTICES -- BUT THE ESTIMATES AND OUR OUR OUR FRIEND HERE FROM THREE DEGREES IN PROBABLY WAY IN BETTER BUT THEIR THEIR ESTIMATES DID LOOK AT SAY INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGE IMPACTS FROM HOW THEY DO -- DAIRY PRODUCTION SAY IN NEW ZEALAND OR BRAZIL VERSES IN CALIFORNIA THAT -- THEY CAN AT LEAST GET SOMETHING THAT'S QUANTIFIABLE AND TRANSPARENT EVEN IF IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S SOMETHING DIRECTIONAL SO I DON'T. I I DON'T OVER PROMISE WITH THIS IT IS GOING TO BE COMPLETELY PERFECT MATH BUT LIKE OUR LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IN SOME OF THESE OTHER -- TOOLS WE'VE GOT THE MATH ISN'T YOU KNOW -- WHEN WHEN YOU GET IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IT IT REALLY IS DEPENDENT ON GETTING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR SYSTEM SO IN THEORY? THEY WOULD PROVIDE BETTER DATA ADDED SOME OF THESE FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS TO IF THEY THEY WANT TO COMPETE IN CALIFORNIA. HI I MEAN JUST BECAUSE LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER THINGS WITH WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO CONTROL MORE IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE THE MOST. CONTROLLED FOOD SUPPLY IN THE WORLD I DON'T THINK MANY WOULD ARGUE AND SO. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT REDUCING CARBON THROUGH THAT VERSES GLOBALLY I GUESS I JUST THEM I AM VERY CONFUSED ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD WORK I MEAN. MY THESIS IN THIS IS HOPEFULLY JUST A STEP TO GET SOME TRANSPARENCY IN DATA INTO THE SYSTEM BUT I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS THE LEADER IN THE WORLD AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GETTING ENOUGH CREDIT FRANKLY FOR THE WORK THEY'RE DOING AND SO. HOPEFULLY BY DOING SOME OF THE SOME OF THIS CARBON INVENTORY WORK WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THAT% TO LIGHT SAY IN OUR DAIRY INDUSTRY OR IN OUR BEEF INDUSTRY OR IN. IN A SPECIALTY CROPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT THAT'S THE HOPING JUST STARTING WITH SOMETHING WE DO HAVE CONTROL OVER WHICH IS THE STATE'S FOOD BUDGET THIS DOESN'T GET INTO. WHAT WE NEEDED PRIVATE RESTAURANTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT HOPEFULLY THE MARKET STARTS TO GO THAT WAY I THINK IT COULD BE A BIG LIFT [inaudible] FOR CALIFORNIA [inaudible] ANYBODY ELSE [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER MELENDEZ WHY HAD? SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS AT MY COLLEAGUE DID -- WHO IS EXCLUDED FROM HAVING TO TURN IN THIS REPORT? WHO IS EXCLUDED IS THERE ANY STATE IT OKAY BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE IS A DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION IS EXCLUDED? THE DEPARTMENT OF BUYS A LOT OF FOOD. RIGHT. THIS IS JUST FOR THE STATE AGENCY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REPORT CARD MIGHT BE CDC ARE IS A STATE AGENCY. SURE -- SO YOU'RE GETTING IT I'M SORRY SO YOU'RE SAYING THE PROJECT THEY SHOULDN'T YOU. SHOULDN'T BE EXEMPTED -- OR YOU KNOW I'M SAYING THEY ARE EXEMPTED AND I'M WONDERING -- WHY THAT IS? WELL I THINK THEY'RE ALREADY GOING THROUGH -- THE PURCHASING SYSTEM THROUGH TGS RIGHT NOW IS MY UNDERSTANDING I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE IS HERE FROM ANY OF THE AGENCIES BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE HAD EXEMPTED -- THAT SECTOR. SO I MISSED THAT. PARDON ME IF YOU CAN GET SOME CLARITY HERE. I I DID NOT KNOW THAT WE HAD YET THE AYE MEANS ANY STATE AGENCY SO -- KATIE DO YOU WANT. TO PULL UP THE SECTION PLEASE. IF I MIGHT PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THE REPORT CARD. SO. UNTIL THE EXPLICITLY EXEMPT THEM BUT NOT THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE REPORT CARD THAT'S A MINIMAL INTO. ABSOLUTELY I DID THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE -- I YEAH I I I DIDN'T EVEN TEND TO EXPECT EXPRESSLY AS M. THEM IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT THIS MEASURE BUT I THINK THE CHAIR JUST HELP ME OUT THERE -- IF THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO THAT REPORTING PROTOCOL WITHIN THE STATE OKAY I'M SO I'M VERY OPEN TO THAT THAT THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA AT ALL [inaudible] WELL -- OKAY [inaudible] I AM. I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR TO YOUR RESPONSE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN ABOUT -- YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU GAUGE THE SERVICE FOOD COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE OR EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY WHICH IS? DIFFICULT YOU KNOW SOME COUNTRIES MIGHT HAVE THAT DATA SOME MAY NOT WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THERE A LOT OF COUNTRIES WHO ARE AS EAGER. TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES AS CALIFORNIA IS BUT NOT NECESSARILY THAT THEY'RE COLLECTING THE DATA SO I GUESS. HOW IS IT THAT WE WOULD STOP -- CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE BUSINESSES FROM -- BEING EDGED OUT BY WRITER DUAL STANDARD RATE SOLVE ANY INFORMATION YEAH DO YOU WANNA COME I JUST HOW YOU DEAL WITH IT RIGHT NOW IN THE RESTAURANT SECTOR FOR THOSE ORGANIC I THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY HELP CLEAR SOME HEARINGS OUTSIDE AND THIS WILL HELP CLEAR THINGS. I THINK IT'S HELP CLEARED UP -- REALLY THE BEST WAY TO TO MEASURE THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF FOODS IS THROUGH -- LOOK. FRIENDS OF STUDIES OF THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES RATHER THAN THE FOLLOWING THE ACTUAL CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT BROUGHT THE FOOD TO THE PLATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- EXACT ACCOUNTING -- OF EACH AND EVERY FOOD SYSTEM. YOU KNOW REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT MORE OF A YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO PRODUCE. A POTATO WHAT IS A PRETTY TAKE TO PRODUCE -- YOU KNOW -- WATERMELON OR CHICKEN -- AND FROM THAT YOU HAVE SORT OF A YOU CAN YOU CAN MAKE A NUMBER AND PUT IN A DATABASE. AND THAT NUMBER COULD BE USED WITHOUT REALLY -- HOLDING ANY PARTICULAR -- YOU KNOW. IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE EMISSIONS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT MAY HAVE BROUGHT THAT WATER DOWN HERE BUT THE OVERALL. IMPACT OF THAT WATERMELON. HERE ON THE PLATE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO OVER TIME WE MIGHT FIND THAT THERE IS -- WATERMELONS PRODUCED -- SOMEONE THE WAITER AND ALSO WATERMELONS. A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO CALIFORNIA -- THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE. TWO FROM A SYSTEMATIC VIEW POINTS AND THEN THAT CAN LEAD TO DECISION MAKING AROUND THE MORE LOCAL PRODUCTS. AND IF I COULD JUST ADD I THINK. WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT LEAST THE AIRPORT YOU IN THE PAST AND THEY'VE DONE THESE INVENTORIES WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE DATA? THEY PICK A HIGH BASELINE FOR YOU AND YOU'RE STUCK WITH THE DEFAULT IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THE DATA THEN YOU CAN PROVE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOWER THAN THAT RIGHT. BUT I THINK. I I I HAVE QUITE THE OPPOSITE INTENT TO DO ANYTHING TO BUY SINCE STATE FARMERS AYE I ACTUALLY THINK IS GOING TO BE A BOOST FOR THEM STATION THAT. PUSHES BACK AGAINST OUT OF STATE COMMERCE -- BUT LOOKING AT CARBON I THINK IS ACTUALLY A REALLY USEFUL TOOL THAT GIVE US CREDIT FOR ALL THE WORK THEY'RE DOING IN STATE AND THEN THOSE WHO AT A STATE THEY DON'T WANT. TO GIVE US THAT INFORMATION WELL I MEAN IT'S UP TO THE AGENCY REPORT CARD PROCESS BUT IN THEORY YOU KNOW YOU GET HIT WITH A HIGH SCORE AND THAT'S A STACK UP. I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND I'M OPEN TO TRYING TO REFINE THAT TO REALLY MAKE CLEAR THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO BE AN ADDITIONAL REGULATORY BURDEN ON OUR END STATE FOLKS -- BUT I THINK THE MATH WILL HELP US. OKAY AND JUST A FINAL THOUGHT WE DON'T -- I I SINCE YOU DON'T SHARE MY CONCERN THAT THIS MIGHT BE A WAY -- TO MANIPULATE THIS PARTICULAR MARKET [inaudible] FINANCIALLY. BY BY HAVING THESE REQUIREMENTS IN BY DECIDING WHO. GETS IN AND WHO DOES IN AND WHO YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MEET THE MARK CAN AFFORD TO PRODUCE THE DATA OR THEIR YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS WE NEED -- HI. HAS A CRUSH YOUR MIND. YES SO FROM ONE FOR MINOR SAY THE CURRENT REPORTING A REPORT CARD SYSTEM. THERE'S WE'RE NOT IMPOSING ANY NEW REGULATIONS ON INDUSTRIES TO PROVIDE DATA THE STATE WOULD BE THE ONE OBLIGATED TO GO TO THAT WORK. SO I'M NOT AS WORRIED ABOUT THIS SORT OF BACK DURING A MANDATE OR ADDING SAY IN NEW EXPENSIVE REPORTING PROTOCOL ON A WATERMELON GROWER OR BEEF PRETTY SURE ANYBODY -- MY THINKING IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GOOD METHODOLOGIES OFF THE SHELF SITTING THERE RIGHT NOW STATES JUST NOT USING HIM RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IS ONE I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT [inaudible] AS THE BUT I APPRECIATE THE APPRECIATE THE CONCERN YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT OFF BASE IN. I I DO SHARE THAT CONCERN. YEAH [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY DO WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND ROLL TOP ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM ELEVEN SB SIX THIRTEEN BY SENATOR STERN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AYE AYE FRIEDMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO CHILD [inaudible] EGGMAN [inaudible] GARCIA. THE EYES Là MON. LIMON AYE MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY. MELENDEZ THE LENDERS KNOW MURATSUCHI STONE. THREE THREE WILL HOLD THE RULER CRAFTED MEMBERS THING TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS. SENATOR NIELSEN HAS BEEN VERY PATIENT. SENATOR MUCH WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. BUT THE FLOOR IS YOURS WELL I THANK YOU FOR THAT THE AUSPICIOUS BEGINNING. LET ME JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE FUTURE FOR THESE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE BEEN SO RAVISHING THIS DEALS WITH ONLY TWO COUNTIES -- EXPECTED CAN BE KIND OF A PILOT OF HOW WE CAN ESTABLISH SUCH A FUNDED WOULD BE AS APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THE REALITY OF IT IS ONE WE DO HAVE THESE FIRES. IF THEY'RE NOT TOO SEVERE THAT LAND CAN [inaudible] RECOVER. BUT IN SOME CASES IT TAKES A LOT OF HELP IN SOME CASES THE SOIL ITSELF IS STERILIZED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. AND THIS IS TRYING TO SET UP.

THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- WILDFIRES ARE CERTAINLY THE MAJOR SUBJECT OF THIS YEAR IT'S CERTAINLY A FEMALE I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT IS IMPRESSED UPON ME AFTER THREE YEARS OF PURSUING LEGISLATIVE EFFORTSIN THE PREVENTION SPACE. IS THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GASES THAT ARE CREATED BY WILDFIRES. CONSEQUENTLY I WAS SURPRISED AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. DIDN'T INCLUDE THIS MAN MADE SOURCE IN THEIR PIE CHARTS ON THEIR WEBSITE OR ANYWHERE IN THEIR CALCULATIONS SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO UNDERGROUND CERTAIN POWER LINES AND WHILE. ARE WILDFIRES OWNS. SO WHY SHOULD INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES CARE ABOUT UPGRADING THEIR GRADES AND TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE. IF CARB ISN'T EVEN DOCUMENTING THE PARTICULAR MATTER AND GREENHOUSE GASES THERE NEGLECT HAS BEEN CREATING. OR MAYBE IN THE FUTURE WE CAN SHOW HOW THEIR IMPROVING. ESTATE. PARTNER ARE ELECTRICAL ASSETS SO MADAM CHAIR I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING A COMPLETE. DATA ON HOW THIS STATE IS ADDRESSING THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN A HOLISTIC MANNER AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE LEE IS SILVERTHORNE. AS MY PRIMARY WITNESS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEASE OR THE ARM OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. CAL CHAMBER SUPPORTS SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DATA FROM WHICH TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON LONG TERM GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAMS. EXISTING LAW PASSED LAST YEAR REQUIRES THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY TO COLLABORATE TO ESTABLISH A HISTORIC BASELINE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR PRE FIRE SUPPRESSION AGES. THIS BILL CONTINUES THAT DATA GATHERING ENDEAVOR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DATA ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS BY CATEGORY INCLUDING BOTH AND ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES AN INCREASE FIRED RESULTING FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IN THIS MANNER THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA TO MAKE SCIENCE BASE DECISIONS ON GHG REDUCTION ACTIVITIES AND TO MAKE COST EFFECTIVE USE OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. HAVING SUFFICIENT DATA DOES MAKE DECISION MAKING EASIER PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY AND ALLOWS FUNDS TO BE USED. AND PUT IN USE WHERE THEY WILL HAVE THE MOST EMOTIONAL IMPACT IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ORDER TO MAKE CALIFORNIA IS A VICIOUS GOALS. FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS CAL CHAMBER SPORTS SB.

OKAY -- YOU DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AYE I WILL -- FOR MY SELF JUST SAY I I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I DO HAVE A SLIGHT CONCERN. THAT THIS INFORMATION IS ALREADY AVAILABLE CAL FIRE DOES LOOK AT AIR QUALITY ISSUES FROM A WILDFIRE CERTAINLY AND THERE'S CERTAINLY NO THOUGHT THAT WILD FIRES ARE GOOD FOR AIR QUALITY. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO CONTRIBUTE TO GREENHOUSE GASES SO I DO WONDER HOW NECESSARY THIS. IS TO INCLUDE THIS -- YOU KNOW I'M KIND OF A SMALL GOVERNMENT KIND OF PERSON SO SOMETIMES I'M WORRIED THAT WE WERE CREATING YOU KNOW -- A LOT OF KIND OF BUSY WORK FOR PEOPLE AND BUT I'M I'M HAPPY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY -- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WITH THANK YOU MA'AM SURE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS.
