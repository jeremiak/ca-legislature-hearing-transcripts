WHICH STRENGTH IN THE INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS AND BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS. SB THREE TWENTY SIX BUILDS UPON LAST YEAR'S SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WHICH ADDRESS BALCONY INSPECTIONS AND REPAIRS FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS. FOLLOWING THE DEADLY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BERKELEY BALCONY COLLAPSE THAT KILLED SIX AND INJURED. SEVEN SB THREE TWENTY SIX REQUIRES AN EXISTING CONDOMINIUM BUILDINGS GOVERNED BY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE H. O. AGE. HAVE INSPECTIONS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY NINE YEARS ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BALCONIES STAIRWELLS AND OTHER EXTERIOR ELEVATED ELEMENTS. TO ENSURE THEY ARE SAFE SB THREE TWENTY SIX ALSO PREVENTS BUILDERS FROM PLACING THE LANGUAGE. IN AN H. O. A.'S COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS OR CC IN OURS THAT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE H. AWAY BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SUE THE DEVELOPER. IF THERE ARE CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION ONE OF MY WITNESSES WILL DESCRIBE AN H. AWAY DEVELOPMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE I ROUTINE WATER LEAK REVEALED THAT A MAIN WALKWAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR. WAS BOUT TO COLLAPSE DUE TO WOULD RIDE THE ROAD BLOCKS THAT IMPEDED THE H. ALWAYS CLAIM AGAINST THE DEVELOPER DEMONSTRATE EXACTLY WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY THE OPPOSITION CONTENDED THIS BILL OF ANTI CONSUMER. I FIRMLY DISAGREE THIS BILL CREATES AN INSPECTION PROGRAM FOR H. AWAY BALCONY STAIRCASES AND WALKWAYS THAT WILL BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ITS SAFEGUARDS TO THE RIGHT. OF H. AWAY BOARDS OF DIRECTORS TO SEEK DAMAGES ON THE RESIDENTS BEHALF IF A CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. PUTS THEM AT RISK THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ALSO CLAIMS A PROTECTIONS TO THE CCAR LANGUAGES ANTI DEMOCRATIC AGAIN. I FIRMLY DISAGREE AN H. AWAY BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED TO REPRESENT THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR MEMBERS JUST AS WE ARE IN THIS BODY AS A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. DEVELOPERS HAVE NO BUSINESS LIMITING THE H. ALWAYS FIDUCIARY OUT. AND TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY. I DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE. FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS ISSUE -- AND LIKE THE AUTHOR A MISSION I HELPING STRENGTH IN THE BILL. I WE'RE BACK HERE LAST YEAR WE WERE OPPOSED SB -- SEVEN TWENTY ONE BECAUSE WE DO NOT THINK THAT THE WAY IT WAS FRAMED A FIT -- COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY COME A CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT SO WE MADE THE COMMITMENT TO CENTER HILL TO WORK WITH HIM IN THE INTERIM AND COME BACK WITH -- LANGUAGE THEY DID AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE FRST PORTION OF S. SB THREE TO SIX RECOGNIZES THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENT DIFFERENCES WITH CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS -- RESPECTS THAT BUT THEN ALSO PROVIDES THE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT INSPECTION AND CONSUMER SAFETY -- THAT IS BEING SOUGHT AND WAS THOUGHT ORIGINALLY WITH SB. SEVEN TWENTY ONE OTHERS ALSO THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE IN SB THREE TO SIX WHICH AGAIN SEEKS TO PROTECT ASSOCIATIONS AND HOMEOWNERS -- AND THAT IS TO PREVENT OR PROHIBIT -- THESE CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO BE WRITTEN INTO THE CC AND OURS WHICH KEEP. AN ASSOCIATION FROM REALLY GOING AFTER IN SEEKING ITS STATUTORY PROTECTIONS OF THAT WERE CREATED UNDER SB EIGHT HUNDRED FOR CONSUMER DEREK CONSTRUCTION DEFECT -- WE APPRECIATE THE THE SENATOR AND THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK CONTRARY IN THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE PRACTICED LAW CALIFORNIA I'VE REPRESENTED. BOTH PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS AND CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT BY ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING DEVELOPERS. HE INSULATE THEIR CLIENTS FROM LIABILITY FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS BY DRAFTING. ONEROUS PROCEDURAL IMPEDIMENTS INTO THE H. AWAY ITS ORIGINAL GOVERNING DOCUMENTS WHICH ACT AS A BAR TO OTHERWISE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS. THIS IS TYPICALLY DONE BY REQUIRING A MEMBERSHIP VOTE. BEFORE THE H. AWAY CAN PURSUE A CLAIM OR EVEN HIRE AN EXPERT TO INVESTIGATE. OR AN ATTORNEY TO ADVISE THE H. AWAY BOARD MEMBERS ARE ELECTED BY THE MEMBERSHIP TO MAKE SUCH DECISIONS IN OUR VESTED WITH FIDUCIARY DUTY TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE H. AAY. SO DOES THE BOARD THAT IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE WELL INFORMED DECISIONS AFTER CONSULTATION WITH EXPERTS IN COUNCIL. THE REALITY IS THAT H. AWAY BOARDS OFTEN DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SYSTEMIC CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS UNTIL THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IS IT IS EXPIRED OR IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. THE DEFECTS ARE OFTEN LATENT HIDDEN AND NOT KNOWABLE WITHOUT INVESTIGATION. THESE MEMBERSHIP VOTES CAN TAKE FOUR TO SIX MONTHS TO ACCOMPLISH AND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CAN EXPIRE BEFORE THE VOTE CAN BE PASSED. THE REQUIRES MANY BOARD IN TOWN HALL MEETINGS TO EDUCATE THE MEMBERSHIP AND DEVELOPERS AGGRESSIVELY CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT THESE VOTE TO KNOWING THAT IF THEY DO. THEY WON THEIR CASE BEFORE CAN EVEN BEGIN. THE OPPOSITION WILL TELL YOU THAT THESE MEMBERSHIP VOTE REQUIREMENTS ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS AND GIVE THEM A VOICE IN THESE DECISIONS BUT I ASSURE YOU THE PRACTITIONER. NOTHING IS FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THESE PROVISIONS ARE GRESLEY USED IN LITIGATION IS PROCEDURAL DEFENSES TO AVOID LIABILITY. SUCH AS IN THE BRANCHES NEIGHBORHOOD CASE WHERE THE MEMBERSHIP DID VOTE AND DID OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED THE LITIGATION. BUT NOT BEFORE IT HAD ALREADY BEEN INITIATED SO THEY LOST THEIR CLAIM ON A TECHNICALITY WHICH MEANS THE REPAIRS. WILL NOT BE MADE OR THE HOMEOWNERS HAVE TO FUND THE REPAIRS THEMSELVES. THIS IS EVEN MORE CONCERNING IF THE DEFECTS PRESENT DANGEROUS CONDITIONS WHICH RISK THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS. LIKE DECKS AND BALCONIES THANK YOU SPECIAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY PROJECTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU TO PLEASE COME FORWARD NAME AND AFFILIATION. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON NANCY TRAVEL WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. NO BEING MINDFUL THAT THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TAKEN IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK YOU DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR TWO MINUTES. REMEMBER THERE HAVE BEEN A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS TAKEN SO IF WOULD YOU SPEAK TO THE BILL AS AMENDED. I THANK YOU THE CAMERA BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND WHILE WE REMAIN OPPOSED THE BILL WE ARE IN IN GRATITUDE FOR AND RECOGNITION FOR THE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS. WE WILL BE REMOVING IT FROM THE HOUSING KILLER LIST AND WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT REMAIN WITH THE BILL AND AND THEY REALLY COME DOWN TO THIS WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL. WHAT WE LEARNED IS IF YOU'RE IN A FIDUCIARY POSITION WITH SOMEBODY? AND YOU HAVE THAT TWINGE OF NOT WANTING TO DISCLOSE SOMETHING. THAT'S A SIGN THAT YOU OUGHT TO DISCLOSE IT. WE'RE TOTALLY FINE RIGHT WE'RE TOTALLY FINE WITH TAKING THE BUILDER AND THE DECLARANT OUT OF PARTICIPATING IN ANY FILING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM WE THINK THAT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WE DON'T WANT THAT. BUT ON THE ITEMS THAT HOMEOWNERS COMPLAIN ABOUT THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT IT NOT ONLY TO US BUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE WHICH IS THERE TO BE THE CONSUMER PROP WATCHDOG. AND PROTECT THEM IN THE DRAFTING OF THE CC AND OURS. THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE BURDEN IS GOING TO BE THAT'S PLACED ON THEM BY THE LITIGATION DO I NEED -- TO PARTICIPATING DEPOSITIONS MIGHT BE CALLED AS A WITNESS. WHAT HAVE WHO PAYS THE COST AM I GOING TO HAVE MY DUES INCREASE OR MY ASSESSMENTS INCREASE? THESE ARE GONNA BE A LIEN FILED AGAINST ME THERE ARE ITEMS IN IT BUT THOSE ARE JUST GENERAL ITEMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF LAWSUIT. NOT JUST CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWSUITS THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWSUIT SUCH AS IS THIS CAN AFFECT MY ABILITY TO SELL SELL MY UNIT OR REFINANCE SAID. AND AM I GONNA HAVE A DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION TO SUBSEQUENT BUYERS. WE'VE HEARD THOSE COMPLAINTS THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE HAS HEARD THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT'S WHY THE APPROVE. THE REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO DISCLOSE THAT. NOW. THIS IS SIXTY ONE FIFTY I KNOW THE ANALYSIS HAS MENTIONED SIXTY ONE FIFTY AS A POSSIBILITY OF A SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT. IT'S NOT THE SAME THING. FIFTY ONE FIFTY ONLY REQUIRES A NOTICE TO THE MEMBERS IN A MEETING AND THE ITEMS THAT ARE DISCLOSED OR NOT OF THE ITEMS THAT I'VE MENTIONED. AND SO IF SOMEBODY IS REALLY UPSET ABOUT THE DECISION THE BOARD MAKES. VAN. THEY CAN OF VOTE THE THE I SUPPOSE YOU CAN VOTE THE BOARD MEMBERS OUT. BUT THEIR STOCK PERMANENTLY WITH THE EXPOSURE TO DUES ASSESSMENTS LEANS AND DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER WITNESSES ARE IT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS. ANY QUESTIONS. I BELIEVE AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE REQUESTED TO REMOVE MOST OF THE OPPOSITION -- I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A CIVIL CODE SIXTY ONE FIFTY REQUIRES A MEETING. OF BEFORE -- BEFORE LITIGATION CAN OCCUR SO I BELIEVE IT DOES COVER THAT CONCERNED -- I ASSUME THAT YOU WISH BY SHAKING YOUR HEADS AGREE WITH THAT PERHAPS OR SOME. YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT IF THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT SO WITH THAT. BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT HERE. ARE AND IF THERE ARE. ANY OTHER. NO QUESTIONS [inaudible] BORROWED DODD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER HILL WHEN I WAS JUST INFORMED THAT THE STATE OF MARYLAND JUST PASSED LEGISLATION WITH THE SAME H. AWAY PROTECTIONS ARE WERE INCLUDED IN THIS SO I APPRECIATE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL MEMBERS. VERY GOOD OF IS OUR MOTION THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATOR Y. KOWSKI THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO ACCUSE ME TO PASS THE SENATE HOUSING [inaudible] AND THE WHERE THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROCESSED AS I UNDERSTAND IN SENATE HOUSING FOR GOOD. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HIGH JACKSON AYE BORDERS ALLEN. ALLEN I COVER EURO JONES MONNING. MONNING EYES STERN. AMERICA. AMERICA I Y. CASKEY I MY COUNTY I READ THE BILL HAS FIVE BOATS WE WILL PLACE IT ON CALL. NEXT UP WE HAVE [inaudible] SENATOR HUESO. I HAVE ONE OF THE BILL IF THEY CALL I'M SORRY. SB FIVE FOUR TWENTY FIVE OF COURSE FILE ITEM THIRTEEN SENATOR HILL. SB. FOUR TWENTY FIVE IF YOU WAIT JUST A MINUTE WHILE OTHERS CLEAR THE ROOM. VERY GOOD THANK YOU CENTER HELP PLEASE VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE SUGGESTED AND APPRECIATE THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE ACTUAL WORK. BECAUSE THIS WEEK WOULD REQUIRE THAT COMPLAINTS BE MADE IN GOOD FAITH. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE IMMUNITY AND IT ELIMINATES THE HEALTH PLAN FROM THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. IS BEFORE TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES HOSPITALS CLINICS AND OTHER HEALTH FACILITIES TO REPORT ALLEGATIONS OF PATIENTS SEXUAL ABUSE. AND OTHER SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN THE APPROPRIATE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITY WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE CLOSES LEGAL LOOPHOLES THAT CAN ALLOW A SUBJECT. OF REPEATED SEXUAL ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS TO WORK AT A HEALTH FACILITY FOR YEARS BECAUSE THE RELEVANT REGULATORY BOARD IS NOT NOTIFIED BY THE FACILITY OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A LICENSEE. ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT BY DOCTORS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS MUST BE REPORTED SWIFTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE LICENSING BOARD FOR REVIEW. SO THAT REGULATORS CAN DETERMINE WHETHER TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION JUST BECAUSE AN ALLEGATION IS REPORTED. IN NO WAY MEANS THE MEDICAL BOARD WILL AUTOMATICALLY BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION. ALL COMPLAINTS SENT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD ARCH FIRST REVIEWED BY A DOCTOR ON STAFF. TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER ACTION IS EVEN WARRANTED. STATE REGULATORY BOARDS CANNOT FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND OTHER COMMUNITY CONSUMERS IF THEY ARE NOT NOTIFIED OF THE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING THEIR LICENSEES. THE FAILURE TO DO SO. SHIELDS BAD ACTORS WHILE EXPOSING PATIENTS TO GREATER RISKS. AS YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE U. S. C. AND DOCTOR TYNDALL SCANDAL WHERE THERE WERE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT FOR DECADES. NONE OF THE PRIOR COMPLAINTS WERE REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. NINE THAT IS WHY THE MANDATORY REPORTING WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS THE CENTRAL. I'M COMMITTED TO TIGHTENING UP THE DEFINITION OF COMPLAINT TO ENSURE THAT RUMORS AND INNUENDO ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED. MY INTENT IS FOR ACTUAL COMPLAINTS FILED WITH THE HEALTH FACILITY TO BE SENT ON WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS NOT JUST SOMEONE OVER HEARING SOMETHING. IN THE BREAK ROOM FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY HEAR FROM OPPOSITION THAT SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE COMPLETELY BYPASSES THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS. PUT IN PLACE FOR HOSPITALS THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BILL. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE EXISTING PROCESS OF HAVING A PEER REVIEW SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY SHOULD REPORT IT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD DOESN'T WORK. AND IT IS NOT WORKABLE FOR HEALTH CLINICS ALSO IT DIDN'T WORK FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WE FINALLY CHANGE THAT IT'S NOW TIME TO EXPECT THE SAME OF OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. WE SEE MULTIPLE EXAMPLES OF HOSPITALS FAILING TO INVESTIGATE CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. DISPLACING THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL PATIENTS IN HARM'S WAY. SEXUAL VIOLATION OF A PATIENT BY THE PHYSICIAN SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE WILL% HELP ENSURE THE PATIENT COMPLAINTS ARE TREATED SERIOUSLY INVESTIGATED WITH THE SWIFTNESS THEY DESERVE I DO HAVE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT. YES I'M JENNIFER SUMMERS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THE BORE CURRENTLY SUPPORTS THREE OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THE PROVISION RELATED TO THE SUMMARY PROVIDED TO THE POSITION. THE PROVISION REGARDING PROBATIONARY LICENSES AND THE PROVISION REGARDING POSITION INTERVIEWS THE WAR WILL BE TAKING THIS BILL TO ITS NEXT MEETING A MAY FOR A NEW POSITION I'M JUST HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I THINK IT IS HERE IN SUPPORT OF A SB. FOUR TO FIVE PLEASE COME. FOR NANCY DRABBLE WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. AND THERE ARE OVER SIXTY SURVIVORS OF AS C. ABUSE BY DOCTOR TYNDALL HERE LOBBYING IN THE CAPITAL TODAY'S SCENE MEMBERS. ABOUT EXACTLY THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU. RIGHT LET'S HEAR FROM OPPOSITION OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE FOUR TO FIVE PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MAKING ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HERE IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE OTHER IS DONE IN THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE LAST COMMITTEE. AND ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THE MAIN CONCERN THAT WE HOLD TODAY WHICH IS THE DEFINITION OF THE ALLEGATION. I OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WAS THAT A RUMOR OR SOMETHING AND SUBSTANTIATED WAS GOING TO BE A TRIGGER THAT. WOULD REQUIRE FIFTEEN DAYS. BEFORE AND WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS REPORTING TO THE APPROPRIATE BOARD OR FACE HEAVY FINES AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO DEFINE WHAT THAT COMPLAINT LOOKS LIKE. WITH THAT LOVE TO WORK ON SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A FORMAL WRITTEN COMPLAINT ND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. TO WORK ON THAT LANGUAGE AS WE GO FORWARD [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION TO SB. FOUR TO FIVE BUT WAS CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING BRING IT BACK TO THE DAIS. CENTER NUMBER GIVE A QUESTION THE AUTHOR. THERE'S A MOTION MADE -- YOU CAN CLOSE CENTER YEAH SURE I WILL MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON [inaudible] GORGEOUS ALAN [inaudible] CABALLERO [inaudible] JONES MORNING STERN. UMBERG. UMBERG HIGHWAY CASKEY HI SB I KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN THANK YOU CENTER FOR HUESO PLEASE COME FORWARD WHERE AN ITEM NUMBER EIGHT MEMBERS THIS IS SB. THREE ONE THREE REGARDING CIRCUSES [inaudible] ANIMALS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SB THREE ONE THREE AS A BILL THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY. BANNED THE USE OF WILD ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES -- FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A A COOL -- ANIMAL CRUELTY FREE ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA. OFTEN TIMES -- PERFORMER OF CIRCUS TRAINERS AND OWNERS AND CIRCUSES. FORCE ANIMALS TO PERFORM TRICKS THAT ARE NOT [inaudible] THERE. OF NOT NATURAL TO THEIR BEHAVIOR OFTEN -- CREATING A DANGER IN MANY INSTANCES SO A LOT OF THESE ANIMALS OF ESCAPE. OR OR COST BOTH HARM TO THE PUBLIC AND TRAINERS. BUT ALSO IT IT'S JUST AN INHUMANE PRACTICE THAT HIS -- WHOSE TIME HAS COME [inaudible] TO END. AND WE ARE PROPOSING THAT IT BE MADE ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA. TO USE WILD ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES. AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. TO PROTECT OF ANIMALS ARE LESSER FROM WITNESSES. WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST? HI THANK YOU JUDY MANN C° CELL FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION ON LEGISLATION COSPONSORED THE BILL. CALIFORNIA HAS REPEATEDLY WITNESSED THE FAILURE OF OUR EXISTING LAWS TO PROTECT ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES CLYDE THE LION BAKED TO DEATH IN A CIRCUS BOX CAR TRAVELING THROUGH THE MOJAVE DESERT TO FRESNO. TEMPERATURES SOARED TO ONE HUNDRED DEGREES BUT THE CIRCUITS DIDN'T BOTHER TO STOP FOR HIM TO HELP. AND HUNTINGTON PARK AT TIGER WAS FOUND DEAD IN NEARLY DECAPITATED AFTER A CIRCUS CRAMMED HER INTO A CAGE WITH FIVE OTHER BIG CATS. AND A MAYES SEATED ELEPHANT NAMED HATE HAITI WAS FORCED TO PERFORM AT A CIRCUS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE NEXT DAY SHE DROPPED DEAD. ANOTHER ELEPHANT WITH THE CIRCUITS JOYCE HAD DIED JUST DAYS BEFORE THE SHOW THE CALIFORNIA BASED CIRCUS VARGAS STOP USING ANIMALS YEARS AGO AND IS THRIVING. IN FACT THERE ARE NO CIRCUS IS BASED IN CALIFORNIA THAT USING ANIMALS THE ONLY ANIMAL CIRCUSES HERE COME FROM OTHER STATES AND HAVE RECORDS OF HARMING ANIMALS AND ENDANGERING THE PUBLIC. THE OKLAHOMA BASED COLE PEPPER AND MERRYWEATHER CIRCUS IS TOURING CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW WITH THE LIONS TIGERS AND OTHER ANIMALS SEVERAL YEARS AGO THREE TIGER CUBS WERE BORN WHILE THE CIRCUS WAS ON TOUR AND TAKEN FROM THEIR MOTHER. DIED AND FEDERAL INSPECTORS SEES THAT THIRD AFTER THEY FOUND HIM CONFINED TO A DOG CARRIER AND A HOT CAMPBELL BUT TRUCK. A US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OFFICIAL WROTE THAT THE CIRCUS DEMONSTRATED A SHOCKINGLY CAVALIER ATTITUDE REGARDING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE ANIMALS YET THERE WERE VIRTUALLY NO CONSEQUENCES FOR THE NEGLECT OF THE ENDANGERED ANIMALS. THE CIRCUS FACE NO FINES. AND A BRIEF LICENSE SUSPENSION IT WAS ALLOWED TO GO RIGHT BACK TO EXHIBITING ANIMALS A NO NO BRIEF LICENSE EXPANSION I SUSPEND. POLLING SHOWS THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORIANS SUPPORT BANNING ANIMALS AND PLEASE SUPPORT SB THREE ONE THREE THANK YOU. BEFORE HERE FOR THE NEXT WITNESS I DID NOT HEAR YOU ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS OF SEVEN THERE'S A RECEPTIVE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PLEASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS HEATHER RALLY I AM THE SUPERVISING VETERINARIAN AT THE PETER FOUNDATION AS WELL AS I'VE DONE FACULTY OF VERMONT LAW SCHOOL WHERE I CO TEACH ANIMAL WELFARE LONG. MY WORK ACTUALLY FOCUSES ON EXPOSING AND PUTTING AN END TO THE SUFFERING OF CAPTIVE WILD ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES IN AND TRAVELING EXHIBITS. IN CIRCUSES THE INSULTS TO ANIMAL HEALTH AND WELFARE ARE NUMEROUS THEY ARE FREQUENT AND THEY ARE EXTREME. INTENSIVE CONFINEMENT FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME EXPOSURE TO STRESSFUL AND UNFAMILIAR ENVIRONMENTS. AND TO BE SO TRAINING TECHNIQUES ALL MAKE THE CIRCUS A MISERABLE PLACE FOR ANIMALS. ANIMALS DON'T PERFORM TRICKS FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT BECAUSE THEY WANT. TO THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY ARE TERRIFIED OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DON'T. AS PETER HAS DOCUMENTED REPEATEDLY ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THROUGH VICIOUS BEATINGS BEHIND THE SCENES WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM IF THEY DO NOT OBEY. AND THEY SPEND MUCH OF THEIR LIVES EVEN DAYS ON END LANGUISHING IN DARK FERRON TRAILERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS MISTREATMENT ANIMALS CAN LASH OUT IN FRUSTRATION AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN HUMAN INJURIES AND EVEN DEATHS. I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND IN THIS WORK THE TOTAL FAILURE OF OUR EXISTING LAWS TO PROTECT THESE ANIMALS AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. FOR EXAMPLE THE FEDERAL ANIMAL WELFARE ACT WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE ENFORCED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. IS EFFECTIVELY A FARCE. THESE SO CALLED STANDARDS TOTALLY FAILED TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE SUFFERING POSED BY THE CONSEQUENT FIND MINT AND ABUSE OF TRAINING THAT IS INHERENT IN ANIMAL CIRCUSES. IT IS ALSO WOEFULLY UNDER AND FORCE AS THE USDA'S OWN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS REPEATEDLY DOCUMENTED. EVEN WHEN SEARCHES THE EXHIBITORS NEGLECT AND ABUSE RESULT IN THE DEATHS OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO STAY IN BUSINESS. AND THEIR LICENSES TO EXHIBIT THESE ANIMALS ARE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED REGARDLESS OF EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS AT BEST THEY MAY BE SLAPPED ON THE WRIST WITH A MINUSCULE PENALTY THAT'S CONSIDERED THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. CALIFORNIA'S PERMITTING PROCESS AS WELL FOR TROUBLING ANIMAL AXE FALL SHORT AGAIN THESE GUIDELINES FAILED TO PROMOTE GOOD ANIMAL WELFARE AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. CALIFORNIA'S SORRY JUST PLEASE VOTE YES ON SB THREE ONE THREE THIS WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED PROTECTIONS FOR THESE ANIMALS AND ALSO FOR THE HUMANS THEY IN DANGER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUPPORT.

MANY PEOPLE OFTEN MISUNDERSTAND. THAT HI SO. IS IS IS A SOMEWHAT OF A QUIET SIGH STATE AGENCY IT'S NOT ACTUAL DEPARTMENT. IT'S A NONPROFIT IT WAS CREATED BY THE STATE IN A PROVIDES. AN ESSENTIAL TOOL THAT IS AN IMPORTANT AT AT BALANCING THE STATE'S. POWER GRID. IT'S A IT'S A NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION CREATED BY. OF THE CALIFORNIA STATUTE AS A PART OF THE EFFORT TO DIG REGULATE THE ELECTRICITY MARKET. IN THE NIGHT LATE NINETEEN NINETIES IT MANAGES TO FLOW FLOW OF ELECTRICITY CROSSED HIGH VOLTAGE OF BALK POWER -- SYSTEMS THAT MAKE UP 80%. OF CALIFORNIA'S IN A SMALL PART OF NEVADA'S ELECTRIC GRID. IT IS BOTH REGISTERED AS A TRANSMISSION OPERATOR AND A BALANCING AUTHORITY. AND AS WITH OTHER BALANCING AUTHORITIES THE CHI SO IS LARGELY FOR WORK AND NURSE WHICH IS AT A FEDERAL LEVEL REGULATED. HOWEVER A UNIQUE TO THE CHI SO AS COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION. IS THE APPOINTMENT OF THE CHI SO GOVERNING BOARD MEMBERS -- AND AND THE PROCESS THEY ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR REQUIRE CONFIRMATION BY THE SENATE. AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN INCREASING TENSION ON THE ROLE OF THE CHI SO INCLUDING. THE DEBATE ABOUT EXPANDING ITS GREAT OPERATIONS FOR THE STRAITS. AND IN THAT WESTERN UNITED STATES. AND IN TWO IN A KIND OF A REGIONAL BRED. THAT IT HAS -- CREATED OF COURSE SOME. SOME CONSTERNATION AMONG NOT ONLY LEGISLATORS BUT PEOPLE HERE IN THE PUBLIC AND THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT. WHAT THIS ORGANIZATION IS WHAT THEY DO? ADDITIONALLY RECENT ACTIVITY CONCERNING THE CASTLE'S FURTHER INCREASE THE DESIRE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONS INCLUDING IN. THE THERE ARE CERTAIN PROPOSALS TO HAVE KAISER PROCURE RESOURCES. THERE IS AN INCREASED USE OF A BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT BY THE CHI SO FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY. THERE IS THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE CRISIS ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET. AND ALSO THE REPLACEMENT OF PEAK RELIABILITY COORDINATING SERVICES AND THOSE OF OF CHI SO -- THESE AND OTHER ISSUES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DESIRE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE CHI SOS OPERATION. AND MANY OF THE DECISIONS AND OPERATIONS OF THE CRY SO ARE OUT OF THE PUBLIC VIEW OR NOT SUBJECT TO PUBLIC NOTICING. AND WE ARE LOOKING AT TRYING TO SHINE A LIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW -- THIS ORGANIZATION OPERATES AND WHAT DECISIONS ARE MADE AND HOW THE A PERFECT THE PUBLIC. AND WHETHER THERE ARE AFFECTS -- TO OUR OUR OUR SYSTEM IN GENERAL. SB SEVEN AWAIT ATTEMPTS TO APPLY MANY OF THE PROVISIONS CURRENTLY APPLY TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES.

BUT APPROVED PROJECTS THAT PROGRAM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RAPE HERE FUNDS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSPARENCY OF THAT ORGANIZATION DESERVES TO BE THE SAME AS THIS LEGISLATURE AND OTHER LIKE BODIES. IN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE CAL ICE OF TESTIFIED THAT THEIR EXISTING BYLAWS ALREADY SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSED THESE ISSUES WELL IN FRONT OF ME ARE THOSE BY LAWS. YES IN FACT IT DOES CALL FOR OPEN MEETINGS. ALTHOUGH IT ALLOWS THE BOARD ITSELF. TO GO INTO EXECUTIVE SESSION AT ANY TIME BASED ON ANY ISSUE BASED ON THEIR OWN DETERMINATION. IT ALLOWS A ONE BOARD MEMBER TO CHANGE THE AGENDA IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. WITH TWO DAYS NOTICE BEFORE HEARING. WE WERE IN REGARD TO PUBLIC RECORDS IT DOES PROVIDE FOR ALLOWING CERTAIN PUBLIC RECORDS TO BE. DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC BUT THEN IT HAS A CATCH ALL FOR SECTION. THAT BASICALLY READS. BUT THE CAL I SO BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHAT INFORMATION THAT THEY WILL MAKE CONFIDENTIAL. SO YES THEY HAVE A RULE THAT SAYS WILL BE TRANSPARENT UNTIL WE SAY WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING TRANSPARENT BUT DON'T DESPAIR. YOU CAN APPEAL IT. TO THE VERY BOARD THAT DECIDES WHAT IS GOING TO BE CONFIDENTIAL AND WHAT IS NOT GOING TO BE CONFIDENTIAL. ONE OF THE LOBBYING ARGUMENTS HAS BEEN USED BY CALAIS SO ON THIS BILL. HAS BEEN THAT THE MERE EXISTENCE OF THIS TRANSPARENCY IN BLUE SKY PIECE OF LEGISLATION. HAS CAUSED THE STATES IN THE WEST UTAH AND ARIZONA AND NEVADA TO NOT WANT TO SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS REGIONALIZATION WITH CALIFORNIA. IF THAT DOESN'T GIVE PAUSE TO THIS LEGISLATURE. ABOUT REGIONALIZATION I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER ORIGIN I VOTE NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK -- WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE SPECIFIC AND MODEST REFORMS AT THE CALIFORNIA I SO. TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND COORDINATION WITH STATE UTILITY ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS AND WE BELIEVE THESE MODEST REFORMS WOULD ASSIST THE I SO. AS A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT BENEFIT CORPORATION IN CARRYING OUT ITS FUNCTIONS IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH STATE POLICY. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT HI SO INCREASINGLY IS PLAYING A CENTRAL ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE CLEAN ENERGY CLIMATE AND RELIABILITY POLICIES. WE PARTICULARLY SUPPORT THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE I TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE INFORMATION RELATING TO SANCTIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF EXISTING TERRACE OR RULES OF CONDUCT BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR SCHEDULING COORDINATORS. UNFORTUNATELY CHI SO CURRENTLY REFUSES TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THESE COMPANIES CLAIMING THAT DISCLOSURE WOULD REPRESENT A PUBLIC SHAMING OR CAUSE REPUTATIONAL HARM TO MARKET PARTICIPANTS -- I WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEY WOULD RESPOND FAVORABLY IF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SAID THAT THEY WERE REFUSED TO NAME THE IDENTITIES OF VIOLATORS ON THOSE BASIS WE THINK THAT PUBLIC INTEREST IS REALLY BEST SERVED-BY DISCLOSING BASIC INFORMATION. ABOUT ALL VIOLATIONS THAT RESULT IN FINANCIAL PENALTIES. I'M AS MISTER WHICH POINTED OUT SB SEVEN AWAY WOULD PROMOTE MORE TRANSPARENCY. IN THE HIGH SAYS OWN OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETING ACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES WHERE THESE POLICIES BY THE CHI SO ARE. MUCH MORE LENIENT THAN THOSE THAT APPLY TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES WITHIN TAKEN TOGETHER THE PROVISIONS OF SB SEVEN AWAIT SHOULD RESULT IN A CLOSER WORKING RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN THE I SO THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SING AND SING NONO THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. THE CENTER HUESO I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION THE I. SO IS A VERY UNUSUAL. HYBRID OF AN INSTITUTION THAT SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY WELL ISOLATED FROM SCRUTINY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTING THAT SUNSHINE IS APPROPRIATE AND OF APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THE MEASURE FORWARD AS I UNDERSTAND IT TOO WE HAVE A THE OF THE MOTION.

I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN ACCEPTING THE MEMBERS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE WHICH PROVIDE GREATER PROTECTION AND SECURITY FOR THE COMMITTEE A COMMUNITY BASED BLOOD DONATION PROCESS. THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE CHAIR FOR BRINGING THE CHANGES FORWARD AND AND FOR ALL THAT THE GREAT WORK DONE BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AS YOU MAY BE WHERE CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY FACING A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF ANIMAL BLOOD. SB TWO OH TWO IS OUR FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO IN THE SHORTAGE. AND ENSURE THE HEALTH AND HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS EVERYWHERE. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO LICENSE COMMERCIAL ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS ONLY ALLOWED FOR THE PRODUCTION CELL BLOOD FROM CLOSE CALL ANY BANKS. THESE BANKS HOUSE DOGS AND CATS FOR FOR YEARS FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF GIVING BLOOD CLOSE KILEY BANKS EARN IMPORTANT PART OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL WORLD. THE GIVEN OUR ANIMAL BLOOD SHORTAGE THIS CREDIT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ALSO MAKE AN ALLOWANCE FOR COMMUNITY BASED MODEL OF BLOOD BANKS. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS WHICH% OPERATE FREELY IN AND FORTY NINE OTHER STATES ALLOW PET OWNERS TO VOLUNTEER THEIR ANIMALS TO GIVE BLOOD UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF A LICENSE THAT. THIS MODEL IS PROVING TO BE SAFE AND HEALTHY IN THIS MEASURE ALSO INCLUDES BLOOD BORNE PATHOGEN TESTING FOR EVERY DONOR. TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF OUR OF OUR BLOOD SUPPLY. WE NEED TO ALLOW FOR THIS COMMUNITY BASED MODEL TO ENSURE A ROBUST AND HEALTHY BLOOD SUPPLY FOR THE ANIMALS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. NOW WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR AND LIKE INTRODUCE LICENSE VETERINARIAN DR HEATHER RALLY AND JUDY MANN COULD GO WITH SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION. THANK YOU SIR WORLD A GOOD AFTERNOON AND TWO MINUTES EACH YEAR IF YOU WOULD. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR HAD THE RALLY GOOD TO SEE SOME OF YOU AGAIN -- I AM THE SUPERVISING VETERINARIAN AT THE FEET OF FOUNDATION AND ALSO A LICENSED VETERINARIAN IN CALIFORNIA IN GOOD STANDING. I'M CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT IS ILLEGAL FOR VETERINARIANS TO OBTAIN. THIS PRODUCT THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED ON OUR PROGRAMS. SENATE BILL TWO OH TWO WOULD CHANGE THAT. A A LARGER AND MORE SO MORE RELIABLE SUPPLY OF LIFESAVING BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR ANIMALS IN NEED IN CALIFORNIA. AND BEYOND. THIS BILL IS A WIN FOR VETERINARIANS IN OUR PATIENTS FOR CLIENTS WHO WANT THE ABSOLUTE BEST CARE POSSIBLE FOR THEIR BELOVED PETS. AND FOR THE DONORS THEMSELVES. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS ARE THRIVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY ARE THE RULE NOT THE EXCEPTION IN THESE BANKS OWNERS VOLUNTEER THEIR DOGS WHO LIVE IN LOVING HOMES AND OUR SCREEN FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES. TO HELP RECIPIENT DOGS WHO REQUIRE THOSE BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR TRAUMA SURGERY ANEMIA OR OTHER DISEASES. RECIPIENT DOGS OF COURSE AND VETS BENEFITS FROM. RELIABLE SUPPLY OF SAFE BLOOD PRODUCTS WHICH IS OFTEN IN SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. EVERY SINGLE DOG DESERVES TO LIVE IN A LOVING HOME AND THEY DESERVE TO HAVE THE BEST BETTER CARE POSSIBLE -- AND IT IS THAT SIMPLE AND IT'S ACHIEVABLE WITH SB. TWO OH TWO THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND VETERINARIANS WHO ARE PURCHASING BLOOD AND OTHERS TO SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S INSPECTION REPORTS FOR THESE FACILITIES WHICH WERE ALL IN THE DARK ON UNDER CURRENT LAW. SO PLEASE -- MY HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB TWO OH TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS I THANK YOU -- I'M JUDY MAN CREW SO FOUNDER PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION. AND I ALSO SERVED OVER EIGHT YEARS ON THAT CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AND I UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THAT MARION'S AND THE ANIMALS THEY SERVE.

I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER BUSINESS THAT'S HAD A MONOPOLY LIKE THIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S ACTUALLY VERY STUNNING -- AT AND IT NOT ONLY HAVE THEY HAD A MONOPOLY THEY'VE BEEN EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE AND SO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE MANY HOURS OF OF HEARINGS TODAY.

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JEFFREY LEE **** ON GREENBERG TRAURIG ON BEHALF OF THE ANIMAL BLOOD BANK. WE'RE NOT HERE IN OPPOSITION I WANTED TO POINT OUT THE ANALYSIS IN CORRECTLY REFLECTS -- ANIMAL BLOOD BANK AS OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- IN FACT ANIMAL BLOOD BANK IS SUPPORTIVE OF COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKING -- AND I WOULD JUST CLARIFY THERE ISN'T A MONOPOLY WE HELPED CARRY LEGISLATION LAST YEAR. THAT MADE CLEAR OF AND VETERINARIANS COULD TAKE AND USE BLOOD IN THEIR OWN PRACTICE -- AND WE WERE SUPPORTER OF THAT LEGISLATION LAST YEAR WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. INCLUDING THE EXPOSURE OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THEM RESOLVED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ADDITION I'M SORRY WE HAVE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT ALRIGHT SUPPORT PLEASE STEP FORWARD CHEN MEMBERS MY DILLON REPRESENT THE VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

UP NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR HERTZBERG HERE ON FILE ITEM TEN SB. THREE THREE TWO I'M IN TROUBLE I GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF MEMBERS WE'RE ALL HERE FOR THE LAST COMMITTEE WAITING WITH. WAITING WITH BATED BREATH. ALL RIGHT I'M IN TROUBLE TODAY ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GONNA TRY TO MAINTAIN A LITTLE DECORUM THOUGH IN THIS -- COMMITTEE HERE. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. CENTER HERTZBERG THE FLOOR IS YOURS. PERSONAL EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMONS AS AS GOOD AMENDMENTS AND I APPRECIATE IT -- IN WATER POLICY WE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR SOME TIME. TO DEAL WITH KIND OF A LARGER ARCHITECTURE FROM HOW WE USED TO DEAL WITH WATER POLICY IN YEARS GONE PAST BEFORE IT WAS TAKEN A STRAW ON THE NORTH. AND STICK IN A STRONG THE COLORADO RIVER AND LET NO WATER IN SANTA BARBARA AND THAT WAS OUR POLICY -- IN CALIFORNIA NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE TRYING TO RE CRAFT WATER POLICY IN A WAY THAT IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE SUSTAINABLE GOALS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SPACE. BY E. LET'S LOOK AT SUSTAINABILITY LET'S LOOK AT NEW ABILITY AND LET'S LOOK AT RECYCLING. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL IS WERE BASICALLY DOING WHAT -- BYRON SHEER DID THE SOME YEARS AGO IT STARTED OUT SAN FRAN PAVLEY EXPANDED UPON IT. TRYING TO CREATE OUR PS EXIT BASICALLY -- FOR WATER THAT'S BEING DISCHARGED IN THE OCEAN -- WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE THIS IS DEBORAH BOX ROCKS MADAM CHAIRMAN YOUR WOMAN? THE THE POINT IS THAT WE GO OUT WE TAKE THIS WATER WE USE IT ONCE WE STEAL IT FROM THE NORTH OR FROM SOME OTHER PLACE WE USE IT ONCE AND THEN WE THREE CLEAN IT UP THE FEDERAL STANDARDS AND WE THROW IN THE OCEAN. WHY DON'T WE READ CHARGE THE GROUNDWATER WATER WE RECYCLE IT AND REDUCE THE BURDEN FOR FARMERS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WERE IMPORTANT WATER? SO WHAT WE DO IS WE STARTED THE DIALOGUE HERE TO START THE DISCUSSION -- OF SETTING A DATE STANDARD. FOR RECYCLING OF OF WATER JUST TO GIVE YOU BY WAVES 50% BY AMERICA LOS ANGELES TO SAID HE WOULD REACH A 100% FIRST HYPERION FACILITY. AND JUST IN THE COMMITTEES I RIVERS AND LOS ANGELES WE LITERALLY USE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET A YEAR FOR THE CITY AND WE PUT THAT MUCH JUST ONE FACILITY FOR TWO FACILITIES INTO THE OCEAN WE CAN DRAMATICALLY REACH SHAPE THE ARCHITECTURE OF HOW WATER POLICY WORKS IN. CALIFORNIA WHICH ALSO DEALS A LOT WITH THE POLITICS OF OF WATER THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM SO AND WE'VE TAKEN THE AMENDMENT RELATING TO DRY WATER YEARS TO THE MAKES SOME SENSE. LOOK YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL WITH RESPECT TO WATER POLICY BUT CERTAINLY WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT. OF WHEELING OF WATER THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE DONE AND WE CAN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE THE SYSTEM OF HOW IT WORKS THAT'S THE REASON I INTRODUCED THIS BILL -- AND THE PURPOSE BEHIND IT -- WE'VE GOT THE OF FOLKS HERE WHO ARE MY WITNESSES OUR GUEST STARS THE TWO MINUTES TO TESTIFY ON THIS THING THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIVE TRADES AND I WILL PASS IT ON TO THEM. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DREADED HAN TIME WITH NATURIST ARSES DEFENSE COUNSEL. A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL -- TO ELABORATE ON WHAT SENATOR HERTZBERG WAS SAYING. THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE A LOCAL RELIABLE SOURCE OF WATER -- WERE FACING ENORMOUS DROUGHT CYCLES THESE DAYS THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY -- AND MEASURES TO ENSURE RELIABLE LOCAL SUSTAINABLE SOURCES OF WATER AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THE END OF THE LAST DROUGHT A SIMILAR BILL WAS PROPOSED A PROPOSED TO RECYCLE 1100% OF THE INFLUENCE. TO THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AT THAT POINT THERE WAS A LOT OF OPPOSITION PEOPLE WERE SAYING THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER WATER SUPPLIERS WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THIS WATER. THERE WAS ABSENCE OF CLEAR RED LIGHT REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE WATER COULD BE REDUCED. AND THERE WAS CONCERN AROUND CREDIT FOR CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY MEASURES THAT PEOPLE HAD ALREADY PUT INTO PLACE -- SINCE THEN THE TIMES OF CHANGE THERE ARE NOW REGULATIONS IN PLACE FOR INDIRECT SUPPORT WILL RE USE -- THERE'S A SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR QUIRK BILL REQUIRES REGULATIONS FOR DIRECT POTABLE REDUCE BY -- TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE STATE BOARD ADOPTED RECYCLED AT THAT BASE FIND DISCHARGE THAT CAN BE PUT TO BENEFICIAL REUSE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE RE USE OF WATER SUCH AS BRINE -- AS THE CENTER RD MENTIONED IT WON'T REQUIRE THAT -- THAT. THAT THERE BE USE OF WET WEATHER FLOWS BECAUSE THOSE ARE AN ENORMOUS BURDEN IT'S DRY WEATHER FLOW FOCUSED -- AND IT HAS AN INTRAMUSCULAR TO TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ON TARGET BY REQUIRING REACH 50% REDUCED BY -- TWENTY THIRTY SO I MAKE SURE I COVER THE POINTS HERE THE THE AS I MENTIONED. WE HAVE NOW IS CRAFTED A BILL THAT WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENCY WITH THE TIME LINES. FOR THE ABILITY TO RE USE THIS WATER -- IT WELL AS THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED REQUIRED THE PLAN BE SUBMITTED BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS. TO TO WHICH IS TWO YEARS AFTER THE REGULATIONS WILL BE IN PLACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. I ABOUT THAT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM. JACKSON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CAITLYN COLUIM THE POLICY ANALYST OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE WHICH REPRESENTS LOCAL WATERKEEPER ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT STATE FROM. SAN DIEGO TO THE OREGON BORDER. WE SET I STRONGLY SUPPORT SENATE BILL -- THREE THREE TWO AS A CRITICAL STEP. THEN THE WANTON WASTE OF AYE DISCHARGING TREATED WASTE WATER DIRECTLY INTO THE OCEAN. AND THREE USES WATER EYES -- VALUABLE WATER SUPPLY. THIS BILL ULTIMATELY WILL ENSURE OF RESILIENT MULTI BENEFITS -- WATER SUPPLIES OF LOCAL LEVEL. AND PROVIDE A VIABLE SOLUTION TO CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM WATER NEEDS. CALIFORNIA -- AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED HAS WELL ESTABLISHED POLICIES THAT. TO PREVENT WATER CONSERVATION EFFICIENCY HERE SIR MOTOR CAPTION WATER RECYCLING. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE STATE WATER BOARD -- ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE GOAL TO RECYCLE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET OF WASTE WATER BY TWENTY TWENTY IN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET. BY. TWENTY THIRTY IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN JUST THIS PAST DECEMBER. STATE WATER BOARD ADOPTIVE ADOPTED TO REVISE WATER POLICY OF RECYCLED WATER POLICY. WITH THE GOAL TO RECYCLE ALL DRY WEATHER WEATHER OCEAN WASTE WATER WATER DISCHARGES STATEWIDE. SB THREE THREE TWO SUPPORTS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STATEWIDE RECYCLED WATER POLICY BY SETTING AGGRESSIVE YET ATTAINABLE A WATER SAVING GOALS. CALIFORNIA CANNOT AFFORD NOR IS A PERMITTED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION TO WASTE A DROP OF WATER THAT COULD BE PUT TO BENEFICIAL YEARS. BY RECOGNIZING WASTE WATER IS A RESOURCE AND NOT A WASTE THIS BILL RE ENFORCES THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND SUPPORTS THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A DROUGHT RESISTANT WATER FEATURE. FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY HER DRIVER TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D GIVE YOUR NAME -- AFFILIATION AND INDICATE THE THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN -- HAPPY IN BETWEEN -- ALL RIGHT MY NAME IS JEFF TOWARD A YEAR ALWAYS A PLEASURE WOULD HAVE TO GET. THERE AND THE REASON WHY AND GOTTEN INTERESTED MORE THIS IS THE P. P. R. C. DID A WASTE WATER THING THIS LAST WEEK. SO BECOMING BETTER INFORMED AND REALIZING THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE -- COALITION OF WATER ALL THE WAY AROUND TO UNDERSTAND AND WASTE WATER IS A RESOURCE WE ARE NOT UTILIZING. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON THERESA BROKERAGE ON BEHALF OF HEAL THE BAY IN SERIES IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MONSTER AMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. BRAIN AND ALSO SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IN A IN BETWEEN POSITION -- SYLVIA SOLELY SHAMI HALF OF CITY OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE BILL'S SPONSORS ENERGY SEE AN SENATOR HERTZBERG AND WE HOPE TO GET TO A GOOD PLACE TO ACHIEVE -- THE CITY IS 1100% SUSTAINABLE WATER CALLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES I ASSUME ARE COMING FORWARD IN OPPOSITION DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YES NOT ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- GOOD AFTERNOON -- JESSICA GAGA WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES. HERE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION TO ASK THREE THREE THREE TWO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS IS A 50% REDUCTION MANDATE BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND 95% REDUCTION MANDATE BY TWENTY FORTY AND THAT'S A MANDATE SUBJECT TO NON COMPLIANCE PENALTIES SO -- WE BELIEVE THIS BILL AS WELL INTENDED BUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM IS UNWORKABLE FOR MANY REASONS. THE VOLUME OF WATER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IMMENSE THIS IS NOT A SCENARIO THAT WOULD ALLOW AGENCIES TO BUILD OUT A FEW MORE PURPLE PIPE SYSTEMS FOR LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION OR OTHER ALLOWABLE USES. THIS VOLUME OF WATER WOULD NECESSARILY REQUIRE LARGE SCALE RECYCLING AND MOVING MASS QUANTITIES OF WATER TO STORAGE FOR REVIEWS -- USING EITHER GROUNDWATER AQUIFER RESERVOIR OR DIRECTLY INTO DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR AGENCIES TO PURSUE THESE TYPES OF STORAGE AND REDUCE OPTIONS ARE NOT YET IN PLACE. THE WATER BOARD'S NOT REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THE RAW WATER AUGMENTATION REGULATIONS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THERE'S NO DEADLINE OR REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO DEVELOP TREATED DRINKING WATER AUGMENTATION REGULATIONS AT THIS TIME. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCIES ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF WATER RECYCLING ON THE WORLDWIDE SCALE. MANY OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES ARE INVOLVED IN DOING SOME OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE AN AMBITIOUS PROJECTS AND THE COUNTRY AND TO PUT THIS PROPOSAL INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR A MOMENT. NONE OF THE PROJECTS UNDER WAY IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THEIR FULL OPERATIONAL CAPACITY WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THE MANDATED REDUCTION SET FORTH IN THIS BILL. I'D ALSO POINT OUT THAT MANY OF THESE BIG PROJECTS AROUND TWENTY TO THIRTY YEAR -- PROJECT SCHEDULES SO THERE ARE VAST REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND HOW WATER IS MANAGED IN CALIFORNIA IN SOME COMMUNITIES WATER RECYCLING IS A PROMINENT SUPPLY FACTOR IN OTHERS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR EMPLOYING MORE. RECYCLED WATER AS PART OF THE LOCAL PORTFOLIO THIS BILL MAKES NO CONCESSIONS FOR AGENCIES THAT HAVE LEGITIMATE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES FOR RE USING THIS VOLUME OF WATER. IN SOME PLACES THERE'S NO STORAGE OPTIONS AND THE MANDATE WOULD NECESSITATE MOVING LARGE QUANTITIES OF WATER OVER FOR EXAMPLE A MOUNTAIN RANGE TO SECURE. ADEQUATE STORAGE -- THE GHG AND ENERGY DEMAND IMPLICATIONS. OF FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARE CONSIDERABLE WASTEWATER DISCHARGES ARE ALSO NECESSARY FOR BRIAN MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND A CERTAIN VOLUME OF AFFLUENT AND LEVEL OF DILUTION IS REQUIRED BY THE WATER BOARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAN JUERGEN AND I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING CHI A GUESS MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT. HI GUEST OPERATES AS A WHOLESALE WATER AGENCY THAT SERVES ROUGHLY THREE COPPER THREE QUARTERS OF INTER COUNTY ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS. ON BEHALF OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXTEND PERSONAL GREETINGS TO THE CHAIR AND SENATOR STERN WHO BOTH REPRESENT pSERVICER AND OF COURSE IT'S TOTALLY COINCIDENTAL THAT HE'S HERE. YEAH YEAH OKAY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE CONGRESS IS STRONGLY OPPOSED SB THREE THREE TWO IN ITS CURRENT FORM. IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN THAT IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL ENTITIES HOLDING AN NPDES PERMIT HOLDER. AND KILEY THIS IS SUCH AN NPDES PERMIT HOLDER. UNFORTUNATELY THIS MEASURE DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGES THE INTENDED TARGET OF THE BILL. AND BRIAN CONCENTRATE DISCHARGES FROM PROJECTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL WATER RESOURCES AND REDUCE RELIANCE ON IMPORTED WATER SUPPLIES. WHICH IS A SAID ESSENTIALLY THE UNDERLYING OBJECTIVE OF THIS BILL. TO ASSIST OUR SERVICE AREA BECOMING MORE SUSTAINABLE CARGAS OPERATES THE SALINITY MANAGEMENT PIPELINE. DESIGNED COLLECT BRINA VERY SALTY WATER GENERATED AS A BY PRODUCT. OF GROUND WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES AND CONVEY THAT WATER FOR SAFE DISCHARGE THE OCEAN. WHEN COMPLETED WATER USERS WITHIN OUR SERVICE SORRY WILL HAVE PAID ON THE ORDER OF ONE QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SONY MANAGEMENT PIPELINE? THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COMBINED COST OF VERY STREAMING FACILITIES THAT EITHER HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE CONSTRUCTED BY OUR LOCAL WATER PREPARES WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY AMOUNT. TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT. WITHOUT OPERATION OF OUR SANITY MANSION PIPELINE IN THE INVESTMENTS THAT WATER AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE MADE INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONVEY. WATER IN SUCH AS THIS. THESE PRODUCTS DO NOT MOVE FORWARD IN OUR OWN REGIONS AND DEPENDENCE ON STATE WATER ON IMPORTED WATER IS NOT REDUCE. THE BILL SITES THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING WATER RECYCLING TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON IMPORTED WATER SOURCES. HOWEVER THIS MEASURE WOULD IN ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DISCHARGE BRINED. THEREFORE OUR ABILITIES INCREASED WATER RECYCLING INVENTOR COUNTY WOULD BE SEVERELY LIMITED. AGAIN IT IS CLEAR THE INTENT OF SB THREE THREE TO SIT TARGET DISCHARGES FROM MUNICIPAL WASTE WATER FACILITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE STEP FORWARD NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE I'M CURIOUS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES OPPOSED THANK YOU. DON GILBERT FOR SAN FRANCISCO PC WE EMBRACE THE IDEA OF THIS BILL BUT FOR THE REASONS STATED HAVE TO OPPOSE THE WAY IT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. A LOT OF EXPENSE OF WATER WITH NO PLACE TO PUT IT AND THAT'S GONNA AFFECT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON BATTLE ALSO ON BEHALF OF WATER RE USE CALIFORNIA WHERE THE STATE'S WATER RECYCLERS -- WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- RECOLLECT RECOGNIZING WE ARE THE RESEARCH WATER RECYCLERS AND WANT TO GET THERE WE SUPPORT THE WATER RECYCLED THERE'S LIKE A WATER POLICY ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD -- BUT THERE'S THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GET THERE WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. YOU ARE NOT THINKING DONNA HERE FOR OF THE NORTH BAY WATER USE THAT THIRTY AND ALSO IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT OUR VIEW IS GENERALLY LINED WITH THAT AS EXPRESSED BY WATER USE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU. THAT AFTERNOON AT THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF MESA WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. JENNIFER WILLIAMS WITH THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMEND THEN. I'M ANGRY APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF THE BELT BELIEVE IT WITH MANDATES IS PRETTY MUCH ARGUE. GOOD AFTERNOON THERE TELL HIM HAPPILY CALIFORNIA CITIES WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS OF KASSON AQUA THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MARGOT PARKS MAP FOR THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION OUR MEMBERS ARE HOLDERS OF NPDES PERMITS -- AND HAVE THE SAME LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES SCRIBE THINKING THANK YOU. AND TOTAL FOR WITH THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE'VE TALKED AUTHORS OFFICE WE AGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND LOOK FORWARD. TO A LOOKING TO LOCAL COOPERATION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS. ALRIGHT WELL I HAVE A A COUPLE COMMENTS I THINK THAT -- CLEARLY FINDING WAYS TO RECYCLE WATERS IMPERATIVE TO THE STATE AND I'VE ALWAYS. BEEN SOMEONE AGHAST AT WATCHING DURING. RAINSTORMS LAWSUIT THE SO CALLED LOS ANGELES RIVER. WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GALLONS GO RIGHT OUT TO THE OCEAN. IN A IN AREA THAT'S A SEMI ARID DESERT SO. I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT I I ASSUME THAT THE PART OF THE EFFORT HERE IS TO TRY TO ADDRESS. AND CAPTURE SOME OF THIS WATER THAT OTHERWISE -- BECOMES QUESTIONABLE SURFING. OF WAVES FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT LIKE THE HEIGHT OF THE WAGE BUT GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT'S IN THE WATER THAT THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT -- SO -- THE QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT'S THE BEST POLICY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN THE DISCUSSION AND THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THE AUTHORS MADE HIMSELF AND I LOOK FORWARD -- TO SEEING HOW THIS EVOLVES -- BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT THE BILL A COULD PENALIZE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS -- IT ENOUGH. THE EFFORT TO WATER A TO RECYCLE AND USE EFFICIENT -- WATER EFFICIENT -- USAGES ARE AS A PRIORITY SO -- IT'S MY HOPE THAT IS THIS BILL AS THE NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE -- THAT YOU'RE MOVING I THINK IT MOVES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A GREATER FLEXIBILITY HERE WORKING WITH THOSE WHO -- HAVE -- PURSUED WHAT WERE I UNDERSTAND TO BE LEGITIMATE AND ACCEPTED APPROACHES BUT NOW. THERE'S CONCERN THAT THEY MAY NOT BE AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU INTEND IN THE BILL SO -- I'M HOPING THAT -- IT THE TRUE WILL -- TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. OF THE DIFFERENT CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED HERE AND I'D LIKE TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO PULL THE BILL BACK IF. IF -- IF IT WOULD BE OUR UNFAIR TO FIND YOU KNOW IF WE FIND WATER AND SANITATION AGENCIES FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WHAT BECOMES AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD. I KNOW THAT ISN'T WHAT YOU INTEND BUT I WOULD LIKE. TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS SO WE CAN ADDRESS I THINK SOME OF THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AT THE SAME TIME I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE. WORKING TOWARD IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE NICE ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF ON PRECISELY THAT ISSUE WITH RESPECT WATER CONSERVATION WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN ON THE TWO BILLS THAT WE DID LAST YEAR. WE BASICALLY -- CODIFYING WITH THE GOVERNOR DID HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH RESPECT TO CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE. AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH -- DEBATED A THAT WAS WHETHER OR NOT WE GIVE CREDIT FOR RECYCLED WATER WE ULTIMATELY CAME DOWN TO GET 15% CREDIT FOR RECYCLED WATER. THE AGENCIES THAT IN FACT DID THE RIGHT THING THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE GAME FOR PURPOSES OF CONSERVATION SO CLEARLY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT WAS THE CORNERSTONE OF THOSE. BIG DEBATES AND WE LOST SOME PEOPLE AT THIS TABLE IN THAT DEBATE -- IN THAT DAY AND SECONDLY YOU JUST THE POINT WITH RESPECT TO THE DISCHARGE AND BRIAN THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS IS TO FIND THE AVERAGE ANNUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE BASELINE VOLUME. TWO WHICH WAS REFERRED. HE TALKS ABOUT VOLUME OF TREATED WASTEWATER. MEANING THAT YOU'VE TREATED IT YOU ALREADY GOING TO THE EXPENSE OF TREATING THIS STUFF IS GOING TO THE FACILITIES IT'S MET FEDERAL STANDARDS THAT WERE TAKEN IT'S GOOD WATER AMBUSH. ROLE IN THE OCEAN LET ALONE DRIVE IN THE AND THAT THAT THE YEAR THEORIES OF THE STORM WATER THAT'S A BIGGER ISSUE WHICH I AM KEENLY INTERESTED BECAUSE WE JUST PASSED IS TO GET A TAX MEASURE. TO PUT A BUNCH MORE WATER IN THE OCEAN WHICH I WASN'T VERY HAPPY ABOUT HAPPY TO CLEAN IT UP BUT SURE GOING TO YOUR SURFING ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO CAPTURE IT. AND WE CHARGE THE GROUNDWATER SO I THINK THAT KIND OF IT BUT YOU'RE I GET IT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT AND WE'RE REALLY ON IT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A LONG TIME. IT IS THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE. AND IF I COULD JUST ASK THE OPPONENTS GIVEN THAT THE THE BILL ALREADY REACHED THAT A TALK ABOUT THE BASELINE VOLUME OF TREATED WASTEWATER. A IS IT YOUR POSITION THAT THAT STILL DOESN'T THE ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN IT DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND MOVING FORWARD WE DO WE DO THINK THAT IT STILL INCLUDES BRINE IT WOULD NEED TO SEE THAT EXPRESSLY CLARIFIED IN THE BILL BUT EVEN IF IT WERE I THINK. THERE ARE GENERALLY -- LARGER CONCERNS WITH -- YOU KNOW SORT OF HOW THE FREE MARKET IS PUT TOGETHER ON THIS BILL AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE IT MOVE AWAY FROM THAT MANDATE MODEL -- IN ORDER TO ADDRESS AT SOME OF OUR MORE OUTSTANDING BIGGER PICTURE CONCERNS. IT ON THE ISSUE BRIAN WE HAVE SUGGESTED SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS IS THIS A A SO I WILL ASSUME KNOWING SENATOR HERTZBERG WHO LOVES THE ART OF THE DEAL THAT THERE WILL BE MANY DISCUSSIONS MORE AND WILL KIND. TRY TO FIND SOME. STATES SAYS HERE THAT THE EQUILIBRIUM THAT WILL THAT WILL WORK AND RESERVING THE RIGHT TO BRING IT BACK IF THERE IS SOME ISSUE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WATER IS. IN A ALWAYS CONTENTIOUS THE ISSUE SENATOR ALAN. I MEAN I I THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THESE BILLS THAT SETS OUT AND AND THEM AMAZINGLY IMPORTANT GOAL -- WHICH WE ALL HAVE WE ALL WANT TO REDUCE OUR YOU KNOW WE WE WANT WE WANT TO PRESERVE CYCLE WATER THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. I GUESS THE THING I I KEEP AT K. WONDERING ABOUT GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THIS BILL AS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ARE WE REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH. ALL THE IMPLICATIONS AND YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF THE LOGISTICAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE BY THE OPPOSITION ANOTHER ONE IS. YOU KNOW THIS IS LIKELY. ME WE'RE HERE WE ARE ON JUDICIARY WE HEARD THIS BEFORE AT THE Q. WE ALL TOGETHER SEE ALL THE SECRET CASES ALL THE SEQUEL BILLS. I MEAN THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL OF ENORMOUS SYKORA. RELATED REVIEW IN LITIGATION AND HAS THAT BEEN FACTORED INTO THE CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THIS THIS. ENVIRONMENTAL GOAL I AND AND YET THE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL -- LITIGATION PROBLEM AND AND MONEY THAT WILL HAVE TO BE SPENT BY OUR WATER AGENCIES. TO ADDRESS THE THE SECRET LOCATIONS ASSOCIATE WITH THESE ENORMOUS INFRASTRUCTURAL PROJECTS TO GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO GET. AND SO I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT IT'S MENTIONED IN THE THE MINORITY ANALYSIS. YEAH. BUT BASICALLY ANY THE BROAD TERMS COMPARED WE WORKERS IF YOU RECALL SOME YEARS AGO WAS REFERENCE I HAVE USED A BILL MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO PUT WATER IN THE OCEAN. JUST TO GET THE WATER COMMITTEES ATTENTION IN THIS ISSUE BUT BASICALLY WE'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT IS WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN RECYCLE PLANS ARE. SO I THINK WHAT YOU SEEN IN THIS MEASURE ALTHOUGH THERE'S ALWAYS WORK TO BE DONE AS STRESSED. THAT WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS THING DONE YOU KNOW ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS I'VE BEEN WORKING THE WATER FIELD SINCE I WROTE MY DISSERTATION IN COLLEGE ON WATER. AND I IN EVERYONE OF THESE MEASURES IS NEVER BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE WATER COMMUNITY IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF HOW IT WORKS THERE'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE THERE'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM IS ALWAYS A LOCAL DISTRICT. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY'RE WRONG IT'S JUST IT'S A IT'S A WORLD WATER WORLD IS. THE GERMANS FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES LEARNING THEIR ZONE PROCLIVITIES IN ITS OWN UNIQUENESS IS AND I'VE NEVER AT THE THE CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT WE PASSED TO VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED BY AQUA. SAME PEOPLE SAME GROUPS SAME OPPONENTS SAME ARGUMENTS YOU KNOW IN THE ONLY I WOULD SAY ON TIE THIS INTO MY CLOSES YOU KNOW I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A 20% RBS. BUT WITH WITH BUT I MEAN WITH RESPECT EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING IT'S PAST STUFF THAT I MEAN I I WANT I MEAN WHAT KIND OF I DON'T DISAGREE THE I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING I BELIEVE I'VE. PUSH ALL THE TIME ON THESE KINDS OF ISSUES -- BUT BUT JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS OPPOSITION THEIR PS WE WE HAD TO PUT IN PLACE. SOME PROTECTIONS AND AND SOME PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WOULD BE A REASONABLE ROAD MAP WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC AGENCIES HERE RIGHT THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT THE PUBLIC IN THE TAXPAYERS -- HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROVIDING IMPORTANT CLEAN WATER SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO DO SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE WHOLE DEBATE WITH. A YEAR ON MINING SITTING TALKING RIGHT NOW -- SO YOU KNOW HOWDO WE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WITH WITH THIS SIX AT NOT DIE I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR FRIEND A PAST EFFORTS BUT WHAT IN THIS BILL. IS GOING TO HELP ADDRESS THE ENORMOUS LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES -- ASSOCIATE WITH WHAT YOU'RE CALLING FOR TWENTY YEAR TIME FRAME BUILT IN TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO COURSE CORRECT AND LEARN TO THE PROCESS. BUT TO AT LEAST START WITH THE FRAMEWORK OF WHAT OUR OBJECTIVE IS AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO IT. SO WE LITERALLY DON'T MEET OUR TALK ABOUT FINAL TARGETS UNTIL. TWENTY FORTY AND IN AND THAT TO ME I THINK IS THE BEST AND MOST REASONABLE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IF YOU ARE A 100% CORRECT WE ARE GOING TO RUN INTO ROADBLOCKS AND BUMPS IN THE ROAD. AND HENCE WE WILL HAVE A FULL TIME LEGISLATURE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO FIGURE OUT THOSE IN THE PROCESS. BUT THIS IS THE POINT IN THE ROAD WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO START GIVEN THAT WE'VE THIS IS REALLY AN ITERATION WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE AYE CONSERVATION WHAT WE'RE DOING IN EACH OF THE OTHER AREAS OF PUBLIC POLICY. TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND AND YOU KNOW SO IN THIS AND EVERY FIVE YEARS IS REPORTING A PROGRESS THE LEGISLATURE SO WE TRY TO BUILD IN THOSE MECHANISMS. TO WHICH I THINK YOU'RE SENSITIVE. TO A CORRECTLY SO BY THE WAY. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATORS STERN.

AND GIVE ME A SNEAK PREVIEW WHERE YOU THINK YOU'RE HEADED HERE AT MY RIGHT TO SAY YOU DON'T THINK BRIAN AND THESE CELLS ARE COVERED IN YOUR DEFINITION OF TREATED WASTEWATER. I DON'T KNOW NOT YOUR INTENT BUT HEARING ALL AS A DAY ONE MORE SUCH AS A BILL SPACES TREATED FACILITIES. I SUSPECT I'D SEEN THE LANGUAGE BUT ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO KNOW IS THAT WHAT LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO SAYS THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ME. RIGHT YOU COULD SAY TREATED BUT IF YOU IF YOU SAID THIS IS NOT A BY THE BRINE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT IN ORDER TO FEEL LIKE THEY GOT BELT AND SUSPENDERS WHICH IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE PRIVACY WORLD EVERYBODY WANTS TO SAY. IT DOESN'T APPLY TO ME SO THAT'S I'M GUESSING WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE WITH RESPECT TO THESE FOLKS BUT THIS SAYS REALLY CLEARLY IN THE DEFINITION THREE TO WATER THAT'S OUR OBJECTIVE OF WE NEED TO MAKING FURTHER. I THINK IT'S FAIR AND THEN THE OTHER JUST. IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU'RE HEADED HERE HOW WAITED ARE YOU ARE ARE YOU WAITED TO THE MANDATE YES.

COLLEAGUES IN JUNE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT PUBLISHED ITS RULING IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS SANCHEZ. THE CASE CAME OUT OF MY COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT WITH MY GOOD FRIEND JUDGE STEPHEN BROBERG PRESIDING -- FORMER MAYOR ACTUALLY OF NEWPORT BEACH. IT COMPLETELY CHANGED AN ATTORNEY'S ABILITY TO PRESENT HEARSAY EVIDENCE THROUGH EXPERT TESTIMONY. I TRIED TO ADDRESS -- THIS CHANGE LAST YEAR WITH SB TWELVE SEVENTY SIX BUT WE NEED MORE TIME. WHEN DID SOME WORK -- IN THE BREAK AND HAD SOME FUN PUTTING. THIS TOGETHER AS IT RELATESTO DEALING WITH FAMILY LAW CASES. FOR A PERIOD OF TIME DURING MY COUNTY PRACTICE DAYS I SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS IN DIVORCE CASES. ASSISTING A SPOUSE IN AMERICA THE SOLUTION THE OLD CLASSIC FORENSIC ACCOUNTING WHERE I WOULD REVIEW THEBOOKS AND RECORDS. OF A OF THE THE BUSINESS OWNER AND TRY TO DETERMINE REVENUE STREAMS OVERHEAD COSTS AND VALUATIONS. I WOULD TESTIFY IN COURT AND I WOULD PROVIDE WRITTEN STATEMENTS AND THIS IS JUST BASIC HEARSAY EVIDENCE. THE SANCHEZ CASE. HAS STOPPED THE USE OF EXPERT WITNESSES NOW THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE COURTROOM INCLUDING BANK STATEMENTS AND RELATED RECORDS. ONE RECENT CASE AN ORANGE COUNTY ALONE REQUIRED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PAGES OF RECORDS TO COME INTO THE COURTROOM. COLLEAGUES THIS IS EXPENSIVE. AND ON OCCASION IT'S RETALIATORY BEHAVIOR WHAT MAKES IT MORE FRUSTRATING IS THAT THERE IS NO JURY IN A DIVORCE CASE. PARTY'S APPEAR BEFORE JUDGE. THE FEAR OF CONFUSING THE JURY IS NOT APPLICABLE. SB FOUR THREE FIVE EXEMPTS THE SANCHEZ DECISION REQUIREMENTS FROM FAMILY LAW PROCEEDINGS THIS BILL SHOULD REDUCE DELAYS AND COSTS. NOT ALLOWING A EXPERT WITNESS LIKE A PSYCHIATRIST MAKES PRESENTING EVIDENCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS CONCERNS OF ONE OF THE SPOUSES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. PULLING IN THE COURT INDIVIDUALS FAMILIAR WITH CHILDREN INVOLVED IN A CUSTODY BATTLE. CAN PUT A MAJOR IMPOSITION ON SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS. SB FOUR THREE FIVE ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY REGARDING THE RULES OF EVIDENCE FOR JUDGES WHO ARE BETTER ABLE TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF TESTIMONY. RELATED TO A CASE RESTORING THE PRIOR STANDARD OF PROOF IN FAMILY LAW COURTS WILL REMOVE A LOGJAM THAT HAS ADDED TO THE PAIN TURMOIL. ANXIETY RESULTING FROM THE BROAD APPLICATION OF THE SANCHEZ CASE. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE AND I HAVE MICHELLE BROWN AS MIGHT WITNESS. AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COUNCIL I IN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST. AND I'VE BEEN IN THE TRENCHES PRACTICING FAMILY LAW FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. NOW I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR BECAUSE HE SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT FAMILY LIFE IS DIFFERENT WE'RE NOT A CIVIL CONTRACT DISPUTE WE'RE DEALING WITH CHILDREN BECAUSE CITY AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE. AND SANCHEZ CONTRADICTS THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TO PROMOTE SETTLEMENT AMONG FAMILY LAW CASES SANCHEZ HAS HAD THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. AND IS THROWN FAMILY LAW CASES INTO MASSIVE LITIGATION IS EXPONENTIALLY INCREASED TRIALS PREVIOUSLY WERE THE YOU HAVE A COURT APPOINTED CHILD CUSTODY EVALUATOR. OUR COURT CHILD. CUSTODY RECOMMENDING COUNSELOR I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THESE ARE LEGISLATIVE MANDATED FAMILY CODE SECTION THIRTY ONE ELEVEN PROVIDES FOR THE CHILD CUSTODY EVALUATOR FAMILY CODE SECTION THIRTY ONE EIGHTY THREE PROVIDES FOR THE COURT RECOMMENDED CUSSING BECAUSE CITY ABOUT BECAUSE CITY. COUNSELING RECOMMENDED COUNSELOR. IN THESE SITUATIONS THEY ARE LEGISLATIVE MANDATED THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE AN EVALUATION TO THE COURT THESE. INDEPENDENT CUSTODY EVALUATORS TAUGHT THE CWS WORKERS PEDIATRICIANS THERAPISTS THIRD PARTY COLLATERAL CONTACTS POLICE OFFICERS REVIEW ALL THE INDEPENDENT DATA THE NAY PROVIDE TO THE COURT AS THE COURTS EXPERT. A RECOMMENDATION FOR WHAT THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD NGUYEN SANCHEZ'S COME OUT NOW IN ORDER TO GET THAT REPORT INTO EVIDENCE. THE PROPONENT OF THAT REPORT HAS TO PROVIDE A SUBPOENA TO EVERYONE OF THESE. PERSONS ARE TO GET THAT REPORT INTO EVIDENCE HOW DOES THAT HER CHILDREN WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE REPORT THAT THE PROPONENT THAT ONCE THE REPORT TO COME INTO EVIDENCE. IS USUALLY BECAUSE THE EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS THAT THE CHILD SHOULD BE PLACED WITH ONE PARENT THE PARENT TO WHOM THE EVALUATOR FELT IT WAS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD. DOESN'T WANT THAT REPORT TO COME INTO EVIDENCE JUMPS UP SAYS OBJECTION SANCHEZ IN HERE WE ARE TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WITHOUT ANY RESOLUTION FOR THAT CHILD. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. EACH STEP FORWARD. TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANDY LEVON BOMB AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO US BEFORE. THIRTY FIVE FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE'S NO REASON TO TREAT FAMILY LAW DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER CIVIL CASE TYPES IN TERMS OF EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS. EXCEPTIONALISM IN THE LAW PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO EVIDENTIARY LATITUDE IN HEARSAY EXCEPTIONS IS A BLACK HOLE OF MISCHIEF AND SIMPLY MAKES THE WORK OF THE COURTS MORE DIFFICULT. THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT THE UNDERLYING NEED FOR US BEFORE THIRTY FIVE IS TO CREATE EFFICIENCY IN THE FAMILY COURTS AND TO SPEED THE PROCEEDINGS. THERE'S NO REASON THAT FAMILY COURT LITIGANT SHOULD EXPERIENCE REDUCE SCRUTINY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE SAKE OF GREATER SPEED IN COURT. SINCE MANY JUDICIAL OFFICERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THEIR CLERKS WORK IN A VARIETY OF CASE TYPES. CREATING A DISTINCTION AN EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS OF THIS MAGNITUDE IN ONE CASE TYPE SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY DATA ABOUT COURTROOM INEFFICIENCIES. PROBLEMATIC PROCEDURES TO SUPPORT THE NEED FOR CHANGE JUDICIAL AND STAFF TRAINING NEW RULES OF COURT AND DIFFERENT COURT PROCEDURES. WELL OF FISSION SEE IS IMPERATIVE SPEED IS NOT IT'S EQUAL THE JOB OF THE CORD IS TO FERRET OUT THE FACTS IN AS EFFICIENT MANNER AS POSSIBLE. PROVIDING AN ADVANTAGE TO ONE PARTY BY ALLOWING THAT PARTY TO PUSH THROUGH REPORTS IN INFORMATION BENEFICIAL TO THAT PARTY BY AVOIDING THE FAIR AND TESTED RULES OF EVIDENCE IN HERE SAY. COULD SPEED THINGS UP BUT WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING EVIDENT AN EMPHASIS ON WHAT IS JUST. AND BY BURDENING THE COURT WITH INFORMATION THAT CANNOT BE CHECKED OR VERIFIED. THIS LIMITS THE ROLE OF FORTY IN DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE. THE VAST MAJORITY BETWEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND 95% OF FAMILY LAW LET. ARE UNREPRESENTED AND THAT MEANS BOTH PARTIES ARE ON REPRESENTED THE STATED NEED FOR HEARSAY EXCEPTIONS IS EMBODIED IN THIS BILL THEN IN NEWER TO THE BENEFIT OF A FRACTION OF FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS. NAMELY THOSE WITH MEANS IT IS THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES THEN THE ABILITY TO LITIGATE AT ALL. AND MORE STRATEGICALLY THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO AUTHORIZE REPORTS AND PUSH FOR THEIR ADMISSION INTO EVIDENCE THAT MAKES FAMILY COURT PROCEEDINGS TAKE A LONG TIME. NEXT WITNESS. OUR DRIVER GONE WE HAVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION AND FIRST I WANT TO SAY WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND ALL THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN RAISED. AND WILL EMPHASIZE ON THAT CARD NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS THAT FAMILY LAW THAT AGAINST WILL BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER LEAD AGAINST EVEN WITHIN THE CIVIL SYSTEM OF WHICH FAMILY LAW IS FOUND. AND THE FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS OTHER LITIGANTS IN THE LAW. AND AS ANY ALSO MENTION THE HIGH. THE HIGH AMOUNT OF LITIGANTS THAT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN THIS AREA FURTHER SHOWS WHY THESE EVIDENTIARY PROTECTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE LEAD AGAINST. AND WELL WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR TO DISCUSS THEIR ISSUE BUT WE FEEL THAT AS BEFORE THIRTY FIVE IS TOO BROAD. GIVEN THE THE PRIORITIES THAT ARE AT STAKE ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED IN THE LETTER DEAL THAT WERE ALSO POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS DEAL WITH THE SHIFTING OF THE BURDEN. THIS IS YOU KNOW AND WE ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH ANY AREA OTHER AREA AND THE LAW WHERE THE BURDEN WOULD SHIFT TO THE OPPONENT. TO PROVE THAT THE EVIDENCE IS HEARSAY AND THEREFORE UNRELIABLE -- ALSO MANY OF THESE REPORTS ARE PREPARED BY PRIVATE EXPERTS PAID FOR BY ONE OF THE PARTIES SO. IF THEY ARE PAID FOR THE REPORT THEY'VE PAID FOR THE REPRESENTATION AND THEN TO HAVE THE UNREPRESENTED PARTY BE FORCED TO GOING TO COURT AND THEN AGAIN. OPPOSE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE REPORT AS HEARSAY WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO PROVE THAT. AND SO SHIFTING THE BURDEN AND THEN FINALLY -- THE REPORTS ACCESSIBLE I KNOW I'VE NEVER SEEN MY MEDICAL RECORD. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES OUT THERE WITH WHETHER YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO SEE WHAT'S IN IT THE FACT THAT THESE REPORTS WOULD JUST BE ABLE TO CON MAN WITHOUT SOMEBODY KNOWING WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE REPORT. IN BEING ABLE TO CROSS EXAMINE THAT PERSON WHO RELIED ON THAT MEDICAL EXPERTS OPINION SO RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB. FOR THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION KAREN MEMBERS I'M ACTUALLY I'M HERE IN SUPPORT I WAS JUST A LITTLE LATE -- I'LL HANDLE IT AND ON BEHALF OF CHANGE FOR JUSTICE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHAT ARE YOU IN SUPPORT ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION? THERE WASN'T A TRICK QUESTION I'M SORRY. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HI MY NAME'S CALAHORRA I'M A THIRD YEAR LAW STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY AND A LOT QUICKER FAMILY BOUNCE ABOUT PROJECT. IN THEIR OPPOSED. ARE VERY GOOD SO WE'RE CLEAR WHO SUPPORT TO WHO'S SUPPOSED ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OF ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. OF THE CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- QUICK QUESTION -- THEY'RE MORE LIKE -- THE BILL REQUIRES THE PROPONENT OF THE HEARSAY EVIDENCE TO PRODUCE THE WITNESS. IT'S ON THE IS IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH THERE ALSO BE CLOSER. SAYS THAT THE THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE PROPONENT OF THE HEARSAY EVIDENCE TO PRODUCE THE WITNESS FOR CROSS EXAMINATION. UPON REQUEST IF THE COST TO THE EXPERTS SUBSTANTIALLY RELIED UPON INFORMATION THE HEARSAY DECLARANT IN MAKING HIS OR HER RECOMMENDATION. CAN YOU HELP ME BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW IS THIS TRANSFORMING? THE THE REQUIREMENT -- TO PRODUCE THE WITNESS FOR CROSS EXAMINE EXAMINATION IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. YEAH I DEFER TO MY LEGAL COUNSEL OF SURE. YES SO THEY'RE ALWAYS IS THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF A MISNOMER THERE'S ALWAYS THE RIGHT AND UNDER THIS PROPOSAL BILL THERE'S A RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINATION. RIGHT NOW AS I WAS STATING PREVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE A CUSTODY EVALUATION REPORT AND THERE'S THIRTY COLLATERAL CONTACTS ONE PERSON JUMPS UP AND SAYS I OBJECT TO THE REPORTS SANCHEZ. YOU HAVE TO BRING IN ALL THIRTY OF THOSE PEOPLE TO TRY TO GET THAT REPORT INTO EVIDENCE WHERE THIS IS SAYING IS THAT THERE IS SOMEBODY TO WHOM THE CUSTODY EVALUATOR. SUBSTANTIALLY RELIED UPON IN MAKING HIS OR HER RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COURT. THEN THE PROPONENT OF THAT REPORT HAS THE BURDEN TO PRODUCE THAT WITNESS FOR CROSS EXAMINATION IF THE OTHER PARENT SAYS LOOK I WANT TO CROSS EXAMINE. THE SCHOOL TEACHER WHO THE CAUSATIVE AYE WHERE SUBSTANTIAL RELIED UPON THAN THE PROPONENT OF THAT REPORT HAS THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO PRODUCE THAT SCHOOL TEACHER. SO THAT THEY OTHER PARENT HAS THE RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINE IT THAT WAS. SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED LAST YEAR WITH SB TWELVE SEVEN SIX TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE JUDGES HAD WITH REGARDS TO CROSS EXAMINATION. BUT THE PROPONENT OF THE REPORT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO PRODUCE. ALL THIRTY WITNESSES TO GET THE REPORT IN THE EVENT IF THIS WERE A NON FAMILY LAW SCENARIO WOULD ALL THIRTY HAVE TO BE PRODUCED I DON'T REALLY WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I HAVE PRACTICE EXCLUSIVELY IN FAMILY LAW FOR A VERY LONG TIME THE ANSWER'S YES -- YOU KNOW THE ONE THING THAT I ALSO WANTED TO RESPOND IN THAT REGARD IS. I WILL TELL YOU SANCHEZ HAS GREATLY HURT THE LOWER INCOME PARENT AND THE LOWER INCOME SPOUSE ON THE SELF REPRESENTED PERSON IT IS ADVANTAGE IN THE HIGHER INCOME SPOUSE AND THE HIGHER INCOME PARENT. BECAUSE OF THAT PARENT OR SPOUSE HAS THE ABILITY. TO JUMP UP AND SAY OF JACKSON SANCHEZ THAT REPORT IS AGAINST THEM AND SAY I WANT A TWENTY DAY TRIAL AND NOT LOWER INCOME SPOUSE TURNS TO THEIR ATTORNEY. THEIR ATTORNEY SAYS I NEED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GO TO A TWO TWENTY TO RESTING FOR AN EXCEPTION HERE BECAUSE UNLIKE. TRADITIONAL CIVIL ACTIONS CONTRACTUAL ISSUES YOU'RE DEALING WITH CUSTODY. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE VERY NATURE OF WHAT IS AT STAKE IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN A DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT MIGHT BE IN A CONTRACT DISPUTE. YOUR HONOR PERCENT CORRECT. THAT'S THESE ARE CHILDREN IS OUR FAMILIES. WE WILL WE HAVE WE HAVE ALL I I ACTUALLY DID SOME FAMILY LAW TO SO YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THE ROOM WHOSE PRACTICE FAMILY LAW. AND AND PERHAPS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF DOING IT AS WELL -- BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROVISIONS YOU CAN STIPULATE TO HAVE A REPORT GOING TO THE RECORD -- THERE ARE THERE ARE TREMENDOUS PROTECTIONS THIS IS AN ISSUE ABOUT HEARSAY. HOW FAR YOU GONNA LET HERE SAY IN AS THE BASIS UPON WHICH AN EXPERT MAKES AN OPINION WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO VALIDATE THAT HERE SAY? THAT'S WHAT THERE ARE THIS BILL LAST FOUR SOUGHT LET'S BE CLEAR WITH THE BILL LAST. FOR OUR IF -- IT WAS THE OTHER QUESTION. ANY NO I THINK I'LL COME BACK PLEASE GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IDEA. I FIND IT NOTABLE THAT THE COURTS THE JUDGES ARE OPPOSED TO THIS. I FIND IT NOTABLE THE FLEX COM IS IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL -- I ALSO FIND IT NOTABLE THAT 85290% OF LITIGANTS ARE SELF. OF IS REPRESENTING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF NUANCES AND I WOULD SUSPECT. THAT THIS IS -- TO TO TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION WILL BE A BOONDOGGLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE. THE PROCESS IN A OF PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL HEARINGS TO BRING IN THIS WITNESS OR OR NOT BRING IN THAT WHEN THIS. THERE'S THERE'S A REASON THAT HEARSAY. OF HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO IT. AND WHAT THIS BILL IN MY OPINION DOES HIS ATTEMPTS TO BASICALLY BLOW THAT A PART. OF AND ON THE BASIS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE PROTECTIVE OF CHILDREN WHICH I DON'T THINK IT IS BECAUSE AGAIN YOU LET YOUR ALLOWING. SOMEONE TO MAKE ALLEGATIONS AND STATEMENTS THAT HAVE. THAT ARE HEARSAY I MEAN THAT ARE OUT OF COURT STATEMENTS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED FOR THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER ASSERTED -- THAT FORM THE BASIS FOR REPORTS FORM THE BASIS PERHAPS FOR EVEN AN EXPERT DECIDING WHAT PROPERTY IS COMMUNITY PROPERTY AND WHAT PROPERTY IS SEPARATE PROPERTY. THESE ARE SO THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY CHILD BASED IF YOU WILL THESE THESE OF FAMILY LAW CASES WHERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES. ARE. O BE DECIDED I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE SHULD. TAKE AWAY THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE UNDER THE EVIDENCE CODE -- IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FAMILY LAW BAR ITSELF COMING IN THAT WE HAVE OBJECTION FROM THE COURTS. AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL REALLY IS A STRONG STATEMENT END -- THAT -- THAT THIS REALLY IS AN OVER REACH AND I THINK. VIOLATES IGNORE RULES OF EVIDENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME AND FOR GOOD REASON RIGHT SO -- MAYBE CREATE AN EXAMPLE DOES TO FLESH THIS OUT. SO IMAGINE AN EXPERT WITNESS. RELIES UPON THE SCHOOL COUNSELORS. A HEARSAY STATEMENT. AND THAT THAT EXPERT WITNESS IS FORMING AN OPINION IN A CUSTODY MATTER. YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT THAT EXPERT WITNESS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO FORM THEIR EXPERT OPINION UPON THE HEARSAY STATEMENT OF THAT COUNSELOR. TO REDUCE THE COSTS IN ALLOW THAT IF IT'S USED AS UNDERLYING JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT EXPERTS OPINION. TO BRING THAT INTO THE COURT SYSTEM. AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT. NORMAL HERE SAY WOULD REQUIRE THAT THAT EXPERT WHAT THAT THAT COUNSELOR BE BROUGHT IN TO SUBSTANTIATE WHAT THEY SAID THAT WAS THAT WAS HEARD BY THE EXPERT WITNESS [inaudible] IN. AND THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE ACCURATE IN YOUR STATEMENT THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT THE CUSTODY EVALUATOR COULD DO WITH THAT IS. THE CUSTODY EVALUATORS JOB AS A COURT APPOINTED HAVE EXPERT UNDER THE FAMILY CODE I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT FAMILY CALLED THIRTY ONE ELEVEN IS A LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED CODE. THAT AUTHORIZES THE APPOINTMENT OF CHILD CUSTODY EVALUATORS TO DO THIS EXACT THING AND TO PROVIDE REPORTS TO THE COURT. AND NOW WITH THE SANCHEZ THEY'RE SAYING WELL WAIT A MINUTE THE LEGISLATING FROM THE MANDATE A CUSTODY EVALUATOR. WHO IS SUPPOSED TO CONTACT ALL THESE COLLATERAL RESOURCES FOR THE COURT NOW HIS OR HER REPORT CAN'T COME INTO EVIDENCE -- SO YOUR STATEMENT IS CORRECT THAT THAT WOULD BE IF IT WAS A SCHOOL COUNSELOR THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE PERSONS THAT THE CUSTODY EVALUATOR MAY TALK. TO AND INFORMING HIS OR HER OPINION TO THE COURT AS TO WHAT THAT PERSON BELIEVES IS IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR THE CHILD. THAT AND IN PREVIOUS AS I STATED IF THE OTHER PARENT BELIEVES THAT THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WITH RIDE UPON THEY CAN TELL THE OTHER PARENT YOU NEED TO PRODUCE. THAT SCHOOL COUNSELOR FOR ME TO CROSS EXAMINE IT. IT DOESN'T STOP THE ABILITY TO CROSS EXAMINE THAT WITNESS AT ALL. SO THE LAW THEY MEET MAYBE GIVEN OTHER IF I EXCUSE ME IF I COULD JUST SOLD CLARIFY THIS. SO AN EXPERT IS ENTITLED TO MAKE BASIC OF A TO FORM BASIC OPINIONS AND TO ARTICULATE I SPOKE TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT PEOPLE BASED UPON THAT. ARE MY GENERAL OPINION IS X. Y. AND SEE THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. BUT IF THEY'RE TAKING THE OPINION OF ONE PERSON AS FACT. AND I AM RELYING UPON THAT DECISION AS FACT. THERE IS THAT THERE IS. THERE IS A HEARSAY OPINION THAT IS BEING USED AS A BASIS UPON IT'S NOT HYPOTHETICAL WE ARE OFTEN TALKING HYPOTHETICALS WHICH WERE ALLOWED. USUALLY TO USE TO GET YOU KNOW EXPERT THE CENTER CUBBY YEAR OLD ASSUME THE FOLLOWING FACTS. AND THEN YOU REGION OPINION BUT TO SAY I KNOW THAT MISTER SMITH -- A HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE TRIAL TO SAID I HATE MY MOTHER. AS SOON AS SO TAKE THAT IS A FACT DO YOU THINK THAT CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE MOTHER THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THING WHERE THIS WOULD HAPPEN. SO YOU TAKE THIS EXTRAORDINARY HERE SAY. IT BECOMES A BASIS FOR THE OPINION THAT THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE COURT IN FROM WHICH YOU'RE ASKING THE COURT. TO MAKE A FINDING THAT THAT CHILD SHOULD LIVE WITH THE MOTHER. IT WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO CROSS EXAMINATION [inaudible] THAT INDIVIDUAL [inaudible] WELL. THANK YOU YOU COULD ALWAYS BRING THAT THE PERSON IN BUT AGAIN PART OF THE PROBLEM IS NOW YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT PERSON IN. SO THAT IS -- THAT'S THE POINT WHEN NO NO NO BUT BUT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU ARE TRYING TO USE. HERE SAY AS FACT THAT'S THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE TRYING TO USE HERE SAY IS FACT AND THERE'S A REASON THAT WE HAVE HAD THESE HERE SAY LAWS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FACT. THEY ARE NOT IN AND OF THEMSELVES UNLESS YOU YOU HAVE THAT THAT HEARSAY EXCEPTION THAT EXISTS BUT IT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WAS EXPAND THAT EXCEPTION HERE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY THE COURTS ARE. OPPOSED TO THE SHE CAN'T DO THIS AND ANY OTHER CIVIL PROCEEDING. AND THE THIRD AND THE COURTS AGAIN INDICATE THEY WANT TO HAVE THAT RELIABILITY -- SO THAT WE CAN WE STILL HAVE THE RULES OF EVIDENCE RATHER THAN SUSPENDING THE RULES OF EVIDENCE THIRD THIRD THERE DOESN'T SEEM I HAVEN'T FOUND ANY GOOD REASON TO SUSPEND THOSE RULES OF EVIDENCE. IN THIS KIND OF PROCEEDING SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THE RULES OF EVIDENCE DON'T EXIST. THERE'S A COURT OF EQUITY NOT A COURT OF LAW. ARE YOU TRYING TO ALMOST TRANSFORM THE FAMILY. ENVIRONMENT [inaudible] INTO. A HYBRID COURT OF EQUITY NOT JUST COURT OF LAW. NO IT'S A QUITE A LOT BUT I WILL SAY THAT FAMILIES ACCORD EQUITY IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN IT'S BUT IT'S THERE THERE ISN'T THIS CASE SPECIFIC HEARSAY ISN'T NECESSARILY THE FAX ADMISSIBLE IT IS THE REPORT THAT IS ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE I THINK THAT'S A BIG DISTINCTION. THE REPORT OF THE CUSTODY EVALUATOR OR THE C. C. R. C. THAT'S THE ON THE COURT SERVICES -- YOU KNOW -- RECOMMENDING COUNSELORS THE REPORT IS ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE TO BE CONSIDERED. THE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL FACTS IT IS THE FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THE AND INTO OVER ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF PRACTICE I HAVE NEVER SEEN. A CUSTODY EVALUATION THAT RECOMMENDS A CUSTODY AND VISITATION TO PARENTS BASED ON ONE PERSON THESE REPORTS ARE USUALLY ABOUT FIFTY TO SIXTY PAGES LONG. AND THEY'VE TAUGHT TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT -- PEOPLE AND THE AND AND AGAIN A WEEK WE HAVE A RESPONSE PERHAPS FROM THOSE IN OPPOSITION WERE SHAKING THEIR HEADS IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT [inaudible] WELL ON AND THE LIMóN BOMB FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL I THINK PROCEDURALLY ON THE ONE HAND WE'VE. STATED THAT THE VAST THE THE THE PROPOSED. LAW THE PROPOSED OF BILL WOULD BENEFIT -- A PARTY THAT HAS GREATER MEANS IN A FAMILY LAW CASE. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE SAID THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF LITIGANTS IN FAMILY LAW DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF THIS. BUT TO PUT A FINER POINT ON IT. IF ONE PARTY IS REPRESENTED IN THE OTHER ISN'T TO ANNA REPORT IS ADMISSIBLE UNDER THE TERMS OF FOUR THIRTY FIVE THEN AND NOT REPORT THEN IT IS CONSIDERED VALID SO IT'S BASICALLY TAKING A THIRD THIRD PARTY STATEMENTS AND GIVING THEM THE IN PREMATURE OF VALIDITY. BY PUTTING THEM IN A REPORT THAT DENNIS ADMISSIBLE AS HEARSAY EVIDENCE. BUT THE OTHER PARTY DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUBMIT A REPORT THEY HAVE TO BRING IN THEIR OWN WITNESSES YOU HAVE A HUGE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE THAT I THINK ALREADY EXISTS. AND I DON'T THINK THE S. BEFORE THIRTY FIVE ADDRESSES THAT STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE AND FAX MAKES MORE WORK FOR THE COURTS. IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS EQUITY AND THAT THERE IS AN APPEARANCE THAT ALL PARTIES AND ALL NEEDS ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND I WOULD LIKE IN RESPONSE. THE SUPREME COURT IS HAS ALSO STATED THAT THE SAME JUDICIAL RESOURCES AND SAFEGUARDS SHOULD BE COMMITTED TO A FAMILY LAW TRIAL AS ARE COMMITTED TO OTHER CIVIL. PROCEEDINGS SO. OF APPRECIATE THAT THE SMALL CLAIMS ISSUE BUT A FAMILY ARE PROCEEDING IS IN FACT A COURT PROCEEDING WERE THE SAME RULES. OF EVIDENCE THE SAME RIGHTS OF LITIGANTS APPLY AND THE COURTS TO SHOULD APPLY AS THEY DO IN OTHER CIVIL MATTERS SO. IT WITHOUT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR MORE LACKEY IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD LOVE TO JUMP IN HERE THANK YOU MADAM GO FOR IT. I'M. CENTER BURGESS -- A COUPLE GOES THROUGH A DIVORCE AND THE THE WIFE SAYS I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE VALUE OF HIS CORPORATIONS IS. AND SO HIGHER FORENSIC ACCOUNTANT THEY DO TEN YEARS OF ANALYSIS. AND AND AND THEY SAY WAIT A SECOND WILL YOU SANCHEZ SO NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'VE GOT. IN ONE CASE HUNDRED THOUSAND PAGES OF BANK STATEMENTS BROADEN THE COURT CERTIFIED BY A A BANK EMPLOYEE THAT THESE ARE THE BONAFIDE STATEMENTS WHICH THEN. SUPPORT WHAT THE RESEARCH WAS THAT WAS DONE BY THE BY THE BY FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS SO YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE ADDED ALL THESE COSTS I WOULD SAY THAT FENCE HAS BEEN VERY EXPENSIVE. THE FAMILY LAW AND IN IN SOME CASES HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ACRIMONIOUS IS LIKE I'M GONNA STICK IT TO THE HUSBAND BECAUSE I CAN. FORCE HIM UNDER SANCHEZ TO PROVIDE ALL KINDS OF DOCUMENTS AND THAT WAS SORT OF THE GENESIS OF A OF THIS BILL -- I'D FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY COME IN SAID BOY THIS IS JUST GETTING ABUSED SO I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRMAN'S COMMENT ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT FAMILY LAW IS. I GOT OUT OF IT AFTER AWHILE I SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS IN IN DIVORCE CASES IN IT IS NOT A PRETTY AREA TO WORK AND I I I JUST BY AND HE SAID THIS IS NOT WHERE I WANT. TO FOCUS TIME WITH REGARDS TO FLEX COM THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE THEY WENT NEUTRAL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. AND NOT ALL JUDGES ARE OPPOSE BECAUSE I WORK WITH JUDGES THIS WHOLE FALL AND WINTER TO HAVE TO TO PUT THIS BILL AT TOGETHER. SO I I'M PAUL I'M HEARING OUT OF THAT TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPONENTS IS THERE'S NO REASON TO TREAT FAMILY A LOT DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER. COURT ROOM AND I I'M MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT IT IS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE FAMILY LAW -- COURTS OF MORE FAIR MORE EFFICIENT AND LESS EXPENSIVE AND THAT'S WHY I I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AS BEFORE THIRTY FIVE WELL WE WE WE OBVIOUSLY SEE THIS DIFFERENTLY I'VE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF JUDGES WHO CONSIDER THIS A BOONDOGGLE FOR THE OF A SPECIALIZED FAMILY. LAW BAR BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR MORE MORE HEARING SO WE'RE SEEING IT DIFFERENTLY OBVIOUSLY -- I I THINK THAT THE CURRENT EVIDENTIARY RULES SHOULD APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD I THINK THE PROTECTIVE OF EVERYBODY -- AND SO -- WELL I APPRECIATE THE THE TIME AND EFFORT YOU PUT INTO IT I THINK THIS TAKES US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. SO -- DO APPRECIATE ALWAYS HAVING YOU IN OUR IN OUR HEARING ROOM AND WITH THAT. IS THERE A MOTION [inaudible] ONLY MOTIONS THE BILL RIGHT THERE IS A MOTION. THE MOTION IS TO PASS A TO SENATOR PROBES PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON NO JACKSON NO BORDERS ALAN [inaudible] CABALLERO [inaudible] JONES [inaudible] MORNING [inaudible] STERN. STERN NO I'M BURKE. MY CAL SKI. BY KELSEY NO. ALL RIGHT THE THE VOTE IS ZERO TWO THREE WILL LOVE. BUT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY MADAM CHAIR SHOULD TO GAIN ENOUGH VOTES TO NOT PASS ME I REQUEST A RECONSIDERATION. CERTAINLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU FOLKS ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A SENATOR TO RISE SO HERE -- SENATOR YOU HAVE -- FILE ITEM [inaudible] SIX FILE ITEM. TWENTY AND THE FILE ITEM TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY SO LET'S START WITH FILE ITEM. TWENTY SB. TWENTY NINE WAIT JUST A MINUTE FOR THE ROOM TO GO TO THE CLERK. THE MUSIC IS RUNNING YES [inaudible] ALL RIGHTY [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. SENATOR DRAWS TO A THIS IS FILE ITEM TWENTY SB. FIVE TWENTY NINE AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROCEED WERE ASKING THAT THERE BE TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. IN ROUTE IN SUPPORT AND THE SAME IN OPPOSITION IF THERE IS SET SO. AND THERE ARE A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING A PLEASURE TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS BILL AND I KNOW WE HAVE. A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON I ASSUME THAT YOU WILL BE. ACCEPTING THOSE AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS YES VERY GOOD. IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROCEED -- THAT -- THE AMENDMENTS AS DESCRIBED ON PAGES ELEVEN THROUGH FOURTEEN I ACCEPT. THANK SO -- JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT TO IT -- OUR FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE COUNSEL FOR HELPING TO PREPARE A SUCH A COMPELLING PICTURE. IN THE ANALYSIS OF OF THE BILL AND REALLY IT'S ABOUT THE REALITY THAT RENTERS ARE FACING. WHEN ALMOST -- FOR HOUSEHOLDS. ARE EVICTED EVERY MINUTE IN THE UNITED STATES -- THAT'S PART OF THE MORAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. AND IT'S EVEN MORE DRAMATIC IN CALIFORNIA HALF OF OUR POPULATION ARE RENTERS 61% ARE LOW INCOME. 81% SPEND OVER 30% OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE RAISING FAMILIES -- THERE WAS A EDITORIAL IN THE LA TIMES TODAY -- THAT SAID PEOPLE CONTINUE TO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS OFTEN FOR THE FIRST TIME. BECAUSE OF A RENT HIKE A LANDLORD DISPUTE OR ANY FICTION. SO WITH MY BILL. SB FIVE TWENTY NINE WE SEEK TO STRENGTHEN THE TENANTS OF VOICES. AND PROVIDE A SELF HELP MECHANISM TO SETTLE DISPUTES. IT WILL KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF COURT. OF WERE A IT IS ESTIMATED JUSTIN LA ALONE THERE ARE THIRTY THOUSAND EVASION FILENE'S IN COURT PER YEAR. AN 85% OF THOSE TENANTS HAVE NO LEGAL REPRESENTATION -- IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING SHORTAGES OF REACHED CRISIS LEVELS -- CREATING A SYSTEM THAT IS INHERENTLY. UNBALANCED AND OFTEN INEQUITABLE FOR TENANTS. OF SB TWENTY NINE EMPOWER IS INDIVIDUALS TO ASSERT THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AS TENANTS WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION. OF FOR EQUITABLE LIVING STANDARDS AND TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND STABILITY. OF THEIR FAMILIES WE'VE HEARD A LOT RECENTLY ABOUT THE YOU KNOW WHISTLE BLOWER PROTECTIONS AND WOMEN SPEAKING OUT ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- IT'S ABOUT TEN AN ORGANIZER IS DIMINISHING THE RISKS THAT THEY FACE AND PROVIDE FOR THAT EQUITABLE SYSTEM SO -- IN SUMMARY AS WE TWENTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE PROPERTY OWNER EVICTING ATTENDANT. OF WHO IS IN A TENANTS ASSOCIATION -- CONSISTING OF THREE UNITS -- OR MORE.

WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU TO STEP FORWARD AND IF WE COULD TO GIVE THEM. AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE. TWO WITNESSES PLEASE [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. HI MY NAME IS DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WERE THE LARGEST RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN THE COUNTRY -- FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT TENANTS ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHTS. TO CREATE A TENANTS ASSOCIATION THEY HAVE THE RIGHT. OF FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION. THIS BILL IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THEM TO DO THAT. WE HAVE ALREADY CREATED -- MANY BILLS MANY LAWS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO WITHHOLD RENT AS LONG AS THEY FOLLOW VERY SPECIFIC PROCEDURES -- THERE IS A RIGHT FOR THEM TO NOT BE RETALIATED AGAINST THEY HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT DAY HUNDRED TO EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE TIME. THAT THEY MAKE A CLAIM. THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED FROM ANY TYPE OF RETALIATION. WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING IN THIS BILL HOWEVER IT ALSO CREATES RENT CONTROL [inaudible] PROP. TEN WAS REJECTED BY THE VOTERS SO THIS BILL SAYS THAT ONE OF THE GRIEVANCES. IS ANY LANDLORD WHO INCREASES THE RABBI MORTON CPI. SO I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT THE VOTERS HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ON THAT AND TO INCLUDE AN AMENDMENT IN HERE IT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND MANY OTHERS WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. OKAY -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON RYAN KINGSTON I REPRESENT THREE REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CITIES. ALL OF ORANGE COUNTY AND RIVERSIDE AND THE EAST BAY -- APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. WE TO JOIN THE OPPOSITION. IN JUST A MATTER OF A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY IF I MAY WE HAVE WORKED ON IN FACT SPECIFICALLY WORKED ON A NUMBER OF KENNEDY PROTECTION BILLS BECAUSE IT BRINGS BALANCE -- THE END IF WE FIND A PROBLEM LIKE THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. PROPERLY POINTS OUT LIKE ON RETALIATORY EVICTION INSTEAD OF APPROACHING IT THIS WAY WE FIX. THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS AND NOT SYSTEMIC PROBLEM IS SOLELY ON RETALIATORY EVICTION JUST LIKE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. TWO ARE WE HAVE WORKED ON A NUMBER AND SPONSORS SUCCESSFULLY STRUCTURE NUMBER DISCRIMINATION BILLS TO PROTECT. TENANTS TO BRING BALANCE AGAIN THIS IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE ANALYSIS. THIRD ALL THE SLUM LORD LAWS THAT EXISTS. REALLY SPAWNER COME FROM THERE THE GREEN DECISION AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. BUT I WILL SAY TO YOU THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE RECOURSE ADEQUATE PROTECTION ANY IF NOT. I'D LIKE IN THE LEGISLATURE. TENDS TO PREFER. TO FIX WHAT THE ISSUE REALLY IS NOT SOME ANCILLARY ISSUE LIKE AS ADDRESSED. AND LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THIS. THIS BILL PERMITS INNUMERABLE -- HEADED ASSOCIATIONS CREATED SITTING AT BASICALLY A KITCHEN TABLE. YOU DON'T NEED BY LAW AS YOU DON'T NEED ARTICLES AND YOU CAN SAY WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A TENTATIVE ASSOCIATION. FOR ONE SUPPOSED TO GRIEVANCE WHATEVER. THE ISSUE IS. WHEN YOU RESOLVE THAT THEN YOU CREATE ANOTHER ASSOCIATION AT ANOTHER ASSOCIATION ALL BASED ON DIFFERENT GRIEVANCES THAT ARE PERCEIVED BY THE TENANT INSTEAD OF RESOLVING IT? GOING TO THE PROPERTY OWNER OR MANAGER THIS CREATES A VERY HOSTILE THANK YOU ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JACKSON MEMBERS -- CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS KATE BALLOT CAPITAL ADVOCACY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK THANK YOU. I'M SURE MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON FOR THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES IN THE SANTA BARBARA RENTAL PROPERTY ASSOCIATION OPPOSED THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AT A REGULAR BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION THANKS THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT SEEING AND HEARING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS ANY [inaudible] QUESTIONS. SIR BORDERS. AND THAT FALL BY CENTER MONNING. WANNA MAKE CERTAIN I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS -- THAT EXIST ALREADY -- IN THE THIRD DEFICIENCIES IN THOSE PROTECTION SO -- IF YOU'RE THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT. AND I DON'T LIKE -- THE LEAKY FAUCET. I IN I COME IN I COME TO YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO FIX IT. AND I COMPLAIN CAN YOU VICTORY. NO IN FACT THE TENANT HAS A RIGHT TO EVEN. HAVE THAT FAUCET FIXED THEMSELVES AND WITH ALL THE RENT SO THEY JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW VERY SPECIFIC NOTICE REQUIREMENTS WE ALREADY HAVE THAT IN THE CIVIL CODE. THE CRITICS OF THEMSELVES THAT THEY WANT TO IN WITH ALL THE RENT SO THAT'S ALREADY ALLOWED UNDER EXISTING STATUTES. ARE IN OF I WANT TO ASSEMBLE WITH. THE FIVE TENETS ON MY FLOOR OR EVEN THE ENTIRE COMPLEX. INVOICE OUR COLLECTIVE DISSATISFACTION WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF THE COMMON GROUNDS -- ARE WE DISALLOWED FROM. ASSEMBLING AN AND MAKING OUR CASE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION YOU CAN DO THAT TODAY IN FACT WE ALSO ADDED. ADDED PROTECTIONS IS THE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO INVITE SOMEBODY THE PROPERTY TO HELP YOU THROUGH THAT PROCESS IF YOU SO DESIRE WHAT THE LANDLORD CAN'T PROHIBIT YOU FROM INVITING SOMEBODY THE PROPERTY. SUCH AS A MEDIATOR SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU WITH THAT SO THAT'S ALREADY INCLUDED IN EXISTING STATUTES AND FOR SOME REASON YOU JUST DON'T LIKE ME AS A TENANT IN YOU WANT TO GET ME OUT -- YOU COULD PROBABLY JUST KICK ME OUT WITH THE THIRD DATE WINDOW OF TIME CORRECT WE DON'T HAVE TO LIST A SPECIFIC BECAUSE YOU'RE CORRECT YOU COULD -- WITHIN A THIRTY OR SIXTY DAY NOTICE DEPENDING ON HOW LONG THE TENANT HAD BEEN THERE YOU CAN. ACTUALLY SERVE A TERMINATION NOTICE HOWEVER I WOULD SAY IF THE TENANT HAD LISTED A SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS WITH YOU THERE ARE PROTECTIONS FOR THAT TENANT WITHIN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. THAT WOULD BE PRESUMED TO BE RETALIATORY SO I SO IF YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO KICK ME OUT AND I DON'T WANT TO GO DO YOU HAVE TO THEN. GO THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS AND SECURE A SHERIFF'S -- SERGEANT OR SOMETHING SOMEONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EVICT ME YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OBVIOUSLY THE OWNER DOESN'T IN FACT WE ALSO CREATED FREE LEGAL ADVICE IN THE COURT SYSTEMS. TODAY SO TEN IS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET FREE LEGAL ADVICE. I GUESS WHAT I'M WHAT I'M GETTING AT IN IN IN THIS IS THAT WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH HAS VERY STRONG PRO TENANT LAWS. SHOULD THERE NOT A KNOCK AND NOT GOING TO VOUCH FOR HELP PERFECT THEY ARE. BUT COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES IN IN THE COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD. THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE LEGAL PROTECTIONS LEGAL AVENUES AVAILABLE TO TENANTS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT RIGHT SERVE OUR VINDICATED. I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS VINDICATED. ABSOLUTELY NOT AND I'VE AND I KNOW SOME PRETTY BAD IS LANDLORDS. WHERE I COME FROM AN FRESNO WE HAD TO LITERALLY CREATE -- NEW POLICIES TO DEAL WITH SLUMLORDS SO THEY'RE OUT THERE I KNOW THAT. BUT THE ISSUE IS NOT WHETHER NOT THEIR BAD LANDLORDS OUT THERE IT'S WHETHER NOT TENANT RIGHTS ARE SO INFERIOR RIGHT NOW AS TO REQUIRE A WHOLESALE. CHANGE IN THE LAW FOR THE UNIONIZATION. OF OF OF THE TENANTS. IN MY CONCERN IS AS WAS DESCRIBED BEFORE IS THAT WHEN YOU CREATE BARGAINING POWER. AND EVERY CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN IN AESTHETICS OR LIVING CONDITIONS IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A MEET AND CONFER OBLIGATION WHICH IS REALLY WHERE THIS IS GOING BUT ULTIMATELY GOING. TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO ACHIEVE RENT REDUCTION. IT'S A THIS IS I MEAN THIS IS COMPLETELY. CHANGING THE WHOLE NOTION OF TENANT FAIRNESS INTO COMPLETELY MODIFYING IT -- TO REDUCTION IN RENT AND IN OUR SYSTEM I THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE THAT'S NOT THE WAY AMERICA WORKS. I IN MY OPINION. WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE ABILITY TO BARGAIN AND NEGOTIATE -- THE OTHER THING IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE SECTION. EIGHT IF YOU HAVE A UNION. NOW ARE WE GOING TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE EVEN SECTION. EIGHT IS GOING TO HAVE TO MEET AND CONFER WITH THE ASSOCIATION TO DETERMINE THE SUITABLE RENT FOR A GIVEN COMPLEX. THIS IS OPENING THE DOOR THAT I BELIEVE IT IS GOING TO BE HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING IS A PROBLEM. WAIT TILL THIS MATURES INTO ITS FULLEST FORCE. THANK YOU -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. TO THAT OR WE'LL LET YOU RESPOND AND THEN SENATOR MONNING HAD A QUESTION OR TWO THANK YOU AND OBVIOUSLY NUMBER POINTS REYES THERE AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS AYE AYE BUT JUST HE AND I JUST WANTED IN PARTICULAR JUST THE FIRST POINT. AROUND WHETHER RETALIATION IS CURRENTLY ARE PROHIBITED IN CALIFORNIA LAW ON IT YOU GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THINGS AND AND I AGREE THAT IN THEORY -- RETALIATION BY LANDLORD AGAINST A TENANT -- IS CURRENTLY ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA -- THE PROBLEM IS ONE OF PRACTICE SO IT CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS A LANDLORD TO EVICT WITHOUT STATING ANY REASON WHAT SO EVER FOR WHY THEY ARE EVICTING SO AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IN YOUR EXAMPLES. IF I AS A TEN ATTORNEY IF A TENANT COMES TO ME AND SAYS I AM BEING EVICTED BECAUSE I'M DOING AXE RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S RETALIATORY NO I MEAN THE FEWEST SENATORS INTHE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT CASE. BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY UP TO CREATE YOUR TO DEFEND THAT IN COURT. RIGHT AGAINST AN EVICTION IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN ASSERT THAT AND SO WHAT THIS DOES. IS ATION CHAIR RIGHT SO WHAT THE WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REQUIRES THAT LAMBERT TO STATE THE REASON FOR EVICTION WHEN THEY'RE EVICTING THAT TENANT ASSOCIATION MEMBER DOESN'T RESTRICT THE REASONS HE JUST SAYS THEY CAN'T DO. AN EVICTION WITHOUT STATING THE REASON AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT LANDLORDS FROM ENGAGING A RETALIATORY EVICTION THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR OR ME BEFORE YOUR WITNESS -- IN YOUR EXPERIENCE -- DOES A SINGLE TENANT WHO MAY HAVE COMPLAINTS ABOUT HABITABILITY -- ALWAYS KNOW THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS. WELL THEY DON'T KNOW THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS BUT WORSE IS THEY'RE AFRAID. TO EVEN RAISE THE ISSUES SO EVEN IF THEY KNOW OF THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS WITHIN A YEAR OF STEPPING FORWARD INDIVIDUALLY THERE'S A FEAR OF POSSIBLE. RETALIATION THAT. TRANSLATES TO EVICTION LOSING THEIR PLACE TO LIVE. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE TO ALL TENANTS. THE MANAGERS OF PROPERTIES ALL SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AS THE TENANTS. THE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET MORE PARTICULARS BUT LANGUAGES. ALWAYS A BARRIER. IN THE EXAMPLE OF THREE FORCE TENANTS SITTING AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE IN [inaudible] PROVIDING. REINFORCEMENT TEACH OTHER A REVIEW OF WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE IN YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT -- RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO ADVANCE A CONCERN -- GRIEVANCE WITH MORE CONFIDENCE THAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL. ABSOLUTELY IT IT ENABLES FOLKS TO MOVE FORWARD AND STATE THEIR CONCERNS -- WITHOUT BEING TARGETED IN THE SAME WAY THEY WOULD BE IF THEY WERE ACTING ALONE. AND THEN I WANT SHIP THERE SOME PROVISIONS IN HERE. THAT. IF THE TENANT IS ASSERTING -- THAT A RATE IS BEING VIOLATED. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION UNLESS IT'S BEEN AMENDED I THINK THEY HAVE TO IN THEIR COMMUNICATION WITH THE LANDLORD. HAVE A PHOTOCOPY OF THE CASHIER'S CHECK TO COVER THE RENT THAT'S BEING CONTESTED IS THAT CORRECT. EXACTLY IN THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE LANDLORD THAT THEY'RE PREPARED TO PAY THEIR RENT. BUT THEY FIRST WANT TO ADDRESS. THE ISSUE AT HAND IN WELL THAT RENT BE REDUCED WILL IT BE WAVES FOR THAT MONTH DEPENDING. PERHAPS ON THE COST OF THE NECESSARY REPAIR. RIGHT THIS DOES NOT TRY TO DO WHAT OTHER SOME OTHER PROVISIONS THE LAW DO IN TERMS OF OF DECIDING WHAT THE CORRECT RENTERS SO IT IS SIMPLY A WITHHOLDING DURING THE NEGOTIATING PERIOD. AND THEN THE RENT GETS TURNED OVER TO LANDMARK IN I WOULD. THANK A DEMONSTRATION OF GOOD FAITH. THAT. THE TENANT IS WILLING TO DEFER. TO AN OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT FROM. WAR. THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE. A RESOLUTION WITHOUT FEARING OF FICTION DURING THE COURSE OF THAT [inaudible] NEGOTIATION. RIGHT I MEAN. THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA PAY THEY'RE PAYING THE RENT. AND I GETTING OUT OF PAYING THE RENT THEY'RE NOT USING THIS FOR ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT FOR A SPECIFIC REASON THAT THEY HAVE. TO GIVE NOTICE TO THE LANDLORD THESE ARE THE ISSUES. AND OVER THIRTY DAY PERIOD LET'S RESOLVE THE ISSUES AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ELIMINATE THE FEAR. OF RETALIATION ONE ELIMINATE THE FEAR OF THE FICTION SO THAT THERE'S SOME. YOU KNOW EQUITY ON THE SIDE OF THE TENANTS RIGHT NOW. THEY COULD YOU KNOW IT'S NO GOOD% NO BECAUSE EVICTIONS YOU CAN DO IT FOR FOR ANY REASON. UNLESS YOU GET A LANDLORD TO SAY THE REASON I'M DIRECTING YOU IS BECAUSE YOU ARE ORGANIZING YOUR NEIGHBORS. I DON'T USUALLY GET ALL THAT BRING MORE PRECISION AND FOCUS TO WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY AT ISSUE. IF I COULD MANAGERS TO FINAL QUESTION TO THE OPPONENTS REPRESENTATIVE. I THINK YOU STATED THAT. UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT TENANTS ARE FREE TO ORGANIZE RIGHT NOW. ABSOLUTELY THREE OR FOUR OF THEM CONSIDER ON THE KITCHEN TABLE AND DISCUSS SHARED CONCERNS OF BATHROOMS SEWER RODENTS OR WHATEVER THE CONCERN MIGHT BE HERE RIGHT. SO IF THIS CODIFIES AN EXISTING RIGHT IT DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE. THE LAW DOES MUCH MORE THAN THAT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE GRIEVANCES ARE. ANY A GRIEVANCE INCLUDES A RENT INCREASE. A GRIEVANCE INCLUDES THE INTERFERENCE WITH QUIET ENJOYMENT. SO QUITE ENJOYING IT COULD BE THE NEIGHBORS THAT ARE MAKING A FUSS OR HAVING PARTIES SO WHAT I'M GONNA BIG THAT TENET BUT THAT TEN IS PART OF THE TENANTS ASSOCIATION. NOW I CAN'T EVEN THEM AND YET THEY'RE CREATING THE CAUSE OF THE QUITE ENJOYMENT SO THE CONFUSION HERE AND ADDED. PROVISIONS TO STATE LAW IS NOT JUST A TENANTS ASSOCIATION IT'S SO MUCH MORE [inaudible] BUT UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THEY CURRENTLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING THAT CONCERN AGREEMENT ABSOLUTELY WE'RE NOT OBJECTING TO THAT THEY CAN DO THAT TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS THE TO EQUATE THIS WITH -- RENT CONTROL IS INACCURATE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY THE RENT IT'S JUST THAT THIS GIVES THEM. A CHANCE TO HAVE A NEGOTIATION WITH THE LANDLORD. AND WHILE WE MAY ARGUABLY AT LEAST ON PAPER HAVE STRONG. RIGHTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR TENANTS WE HAVE I THINK WE ALL AGREE AMONG THE WORST. CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH. FINDING A HOMES FOR PEOPLE AND APARTMENTS AND PLAY AND DWELLING PLACES AND THAT THE CAR SEAT BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. A DISPARITY ARE SO SEVERE THAT PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME FOLKS ARE. REALLY CHALLENGE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SECURITY OF A PLACE TO LIVE AND I SUSPECT THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S MOTIVATING THIS AS WELL SO ON SENATOR STERN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR I WAS OVER PUT YOUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL HERE AND TRY TO DEAL WITH. THE HOUSING CRISIS IN IT WHERE IT'S MOST ACUTE IS IN YOU KNOW THE RENTER'S. WORLD AND MOSTLY AMONG LOWER INCOME FOLKS AND THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ATTORNEYS AND SO I I I SEE THE HUGE CHALLENGES AND I FRANKLY THINK THIS. THERE'S SOME CREATIVITY AND NOVELTY TO THIS APPROACH SO I'M STILL TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND IT ALL CAN YOU. CAN YOU -- DRILL DOWN ON THIS. IS A BACK DOOR RENT CONTROL ARE NOT ISSUE THOUGH THIS NOTION OF THE GREEK BUT THE GRIEVANCE ABOUT RATE INCREASE. OVERSEE PI AND IF IF THAT'S A NEW KIND OF GRIEVANCE THAT WE'D BE ADDING TO THE LAW IT LIKE JUST. MECHANICALLY HOW'D WORKERS I I I'M I'M I'M. INCREDIBLY SYMPATHETIC -- TO THE TO THE CASE WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S SORT OF THE I NAY ISSUED GRIEVANCE -- ABOUT SAY I MEAN TO YOUR TO YOUR LEAD WITNESSES POINT I WAS ACTUALLY CURIOUS FROM YOUR LEAD WITNESS WHETHER SHE PUT A GRIEVANCE FORWARD AND THEN WAS RETALIATED AGAINST BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME LEGAL RECOURSE THERE BUT JUST IN TERMS OF GAP FEELING HERE -- HOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU VIEW THAT ISSUE OF OF OF RENT CONTROL OR NOT? I MEAN I KNOW IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY RECKON SHOW BUT THAT THAT CPI ISSUE IS THAT IS THAT A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS BILL FOR YOU. WELL THERE IS. THIS HAVE TO BE A IT'S LISTED AS ONE OF THE REASONS. RIGHT OF A GRIEVANCES THAT COULD BE LISTED OUGHT TO THE LANDLORD BY THE TENANTS SAYING. WE WANT TO NEGOTIATE OVER THIS SO. RENT INCREASE COULD BE IT COULD BE BECAUSE LAST MONTH THERE WAS A HUNDRED DOLLAR RENT INCREASE AND SO LIKE TO DO IT AGAIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THOSE. ATTENDANCE AND AND BE ABLE TO RENT IT OUT AT MUCH MUCH HIGHER SO. YES RENT INCREASES ONE ISSUE. THAT COULD BE A REASON FOR A GRIEVANCE A LONG LINE ALONG THE LINES OF OTHER OF OTHER ISSUES SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT IT'S NOT CONTROLLING THE RENT. IT'S SAYING. WE WANT TO DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU WE WANT TO BE FAIR WE WANT TO BE REASONABLE -- ABOUT IT -- AND SO THEY CAN DO THAT THEY WOULD HOLD IT THE COULD WITHHOLD THE RENT FOR THE MONTH BUT THEN. THEY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE MONEY IS THERE THEY'RE PUTTING IT UP FRONT THEY HAVE TO PUT UP A COPY OF THE CASHIER'S CHECK. TO SHOW THAT THEY'RE PAYING. THEY HAVE TO GIVE THAT CHECK. AFTER THIRTY DAYS THEY HAVE TO GIVE THE CHECK SO THEY ACTUALLY END UP PAYING. THEY DON'T SKIP PAYING THE RENT BUT THEY JUST TO GET THE LANDLORDS ATTENTION. AND TO HAVE SOME STRENGTH ON THEIR SIDE VERSES. I'M NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA LISTEN TO YOU ALL I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ALL I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE YOU A CAUSE FOR MY EBAY AUCTION. I GUESS I I JUST SEE THAT THAT PROVISION BEING USED. EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'VE HAD MY REJECT UP THREE HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH -- I MEAN SO. I YOU KNOW I EIGHT WHY WOULDN'T ARE I MEAN I I LIVE IN APARTMENT COMPLEX AT AND THERE'S THERE'S LIKE IT'S A BIG. ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE -- BUT YOU DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT PROVISION BEING EXERCISED VERY FREQUENTLY I KNOW WE LIMITED NOW TO TWICE. A YEAR YES SORRY YEAH IS THAT RIGHT WITH THE IMMENSE. BUT IN THIS IS GONNA BE. OF ALL THE PROVISION OF ALL THE GRIEVANCES THAT MAKE THIS KIND OF RENT STRIKE ELIGIBLE. THAT ONE SEEMS TO BE MEAN RENT IS INCREASING AT AN ACROSS THE BOARD SO AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE -- TO HAVE A FAIR RATE INCREASE BUT THAT'S BETWEEN THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT. THAT'S BETWEEN THEM RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S ONLY UP TO THE LANDLORD TO DECIDE AS MUCH AS THEY WANT. TO THEY COULD DO IT -- AS HIGH AS THEY WANT AND THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY. THIS AT LEAST GIVES A TENANTS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THAT AND WHAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S MORE FAIR SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S AN IMPASSE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE LANDLORD SAYS. NO. THAT IS A PRECIADO YOU SET ASIDE THE MONEY LIKE THIS IS JUSTIFIED BY THE MARKET AND WHAT IT IS IN THE REGION AND IT'S NOT. INTENDED TO KICK YOU OUT BUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS THEN. I DON'T I'M NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE LEADING HERE I'M JUST. TRYING TO WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY CAN DEMAND THE RENT YOU DON'T THERE'S NOT ANY RECOURSE. SO IT SO THEY DON'T THERE'S NO THERE'S NO SORT OF THEY DON'T HAVE TO REACH SOME RESOLUTION LG'S THERE ARE FINDING IT HAS TO BE MADE A FILM THE LANDLORD SORT OF REASONABLY DECLINED THE THE BASIS FOR THE RESULT THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY. A VERY SIMPLE WHITE TOUCH IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT FOR THIRTY DAYS [inaudible] THE TENANT. CAN WE CAN WITHHOLD THE RANT ALTHOUGH HAVE A CASHIER'S CHECK DEMONSTRATING. THAT THEY ARE GOING TO PAY THE RENT AT THE END OF THE THIRTY DAYS BUT THE ATTEMPT THE EFFORT IS. TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THE LANDLORDS TO DOWN WITH THE LANDLORD AND TRY TO HAVE A NEGOTIATION. IF THAT FAILS THEY GOT TO PAY THE RENT SO YOU CAN HAVE LANDLORDS WHO BASICALLY SAY TO THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW GO POUND SAND. AND THEY CAN FOR SOME TO PAY THE RENT SO THEY'RE THEY'RE AND LESS I MISSING SOMETHING. THERE AREN'T ANY THERE ARE THERE ARE NO OTHER TEETH IN THIS. TO TO DO IT EXACTLY CORRECT BUT IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL IS IT IS DEFENSIVE SO IN YOUR SITUATION WHERE -- THE TENANTS GET THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR RENT INCREASE AND ARE UPSET THE ASSOCIATION GOES THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO ESSENTIALLY DELAY -- THE RENT PAYMENT TO DISCUSS WITHOUT THIS BILL WHAT HAPPENS IS THE DAY THAT RENT IS DUE. WHEN THEY DON'T PAY AT BECAUSE THEY'RE NEGOTIATE WITH THE LAND OR THEY GET A THREE DAY? NOTICE THEY HAVE NO DEFENSE AND UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION IS FILED AGAINST THEM THREE DAYS LATER AND IN MOST CASES THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO COUNSEL AND THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR HOME WHEN THEY CALL OUR HOTLINE AND SAY I DON'T LIKE THE RENT INCREASE. IF WE SAY WELL YOU KNOW DON'T PAY IT DISCUSS WITH YOU WHAT WE THAT WOULD BE RECKLESS OF US BECAUSE THEY WILL LOSE THEIR HOME. THIS BILL DOESN'T ALLEVIATE AND RELIEVE THEM OF THE OBLIGATION. VISIT BUYS TIME TIME WHERE THEY'RE NOT FACING AN EVICTION LAWSUIT WHERE THEY CAN SIT DOWN WITH OUR LANDERS FORCED TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM. BEFORE THEY HAVE TO TURN OVER THAT RENT ALREADY LET LAST QUESTION HERE PLEASE THANK YOU AJIT JUST FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT I MEAN IS THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT'S AN ACCURATE LEE STATEMENT OF HOW THE THE BILL FUNCTIONS DO YOU DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT INTERPRETATION LEASE OF THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT THAT THERE'S NO SORT OF PRE DECIDED OUTCOME IN THAT. THIRTY DAY THE WAY YOU VIEW THE TENETS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN EITHER A THIRTY OR SIXTY DAY NOTICE OF THE RENT INCREASE THAT NEGOTIATION COULD HAPPEN TODAY BETWEEN THAT THIRTY IN SIXTY DAYS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THAT INCREASED READ. NOT DEFENDING THOSE RENT INCREASES BUT THIRTY SIXTY DAYS THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN GIVEN THAT TIME TO TO DO THE NEGOTIATION IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT BEYOND THAT THEN. THIS BILL SAYS NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE TIME TO NEGOTIATE. I STILL DON'T THINK IT'S CLEAR ON WHAT DO YOU DO IF THERE'S AN IMPASSE. THIS IS TENANTS TAKING THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. SO ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER THINGS NOT JUST INCLUDING RENT INCREASES BUT OTHER THINGS SUCH AS BUT AS IT TENANTS IT INDICATED BED BUGS EXCEPT TO RUSSIA -- WE HAVE LAWS ON THAT SO. WELL MADE AND AND PERHAPS WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE EXPRESSING THE FACT THAT THE THE THE WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY IS NOT BEING MET THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH THE LANDLORD AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE INTENT IS. SO WITH THAT SENATOR THRUST WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. TO USE LET ME I'M I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I KNOW I KNOW THIS IS A BIG CHANGE IN LAW THOUGH SO I I REALLY DO WANT TO SEE HOW THIS INVOLVES BEFORE THE FLOOR BEFORE COMMITTING TO YOU ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AGAIN -- IN TWENTY ELEVEN I USE DEVELOP THE OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE. PERFORMANCE BASED NATIONAL DETENTION STANDARDS AND THAT'S WITH THE LAY OUT THE BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS DETAINEES SHOULD RECEIVE WELL IN CIVIL. THE TENSION I JUST WANT TO REALLY EMPHASIZE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CIVIL DETENTION NOT CRIMINAL DETENTION. THOSE STANDARDS WERE NOT CODIFIED AND THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENFORCEABLE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN DETENTION FACILITIES INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE. OF LITTLE ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL OVER USE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND EVEN DEATH. OVER THE LAST YEAR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA HAVE RAISED ALARM MEAN ISSUES AT IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE OUR TWO THOUSAND TEN ICE REPORTED A TOTAL OF EIGHTY TO DEATH. IN ADULT IMMIGRATION CIVIL DETENTION CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA THERE BEEN THIRTEEN DEATHS IN IMMIGRATION CIVIL DETENTION CENTERS. INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXPERTS FOUND TWENTY THREE CASES OF INADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE THE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FATALITY. OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT ON CITY COUNTY CONTRACTS WITH ICE CONCLUDES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD IMPROVE THEIR OVERSIGHT OF CIVIL DETENTION CONTRACTS. TO ADDRESS COST OVERRUNS AND SERIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS. THE CITY'S PROVIDE LITTLE OR NO OVERSIGHT OF THE PRIVATE OPERATORS AND SIMPLY PASSED FEDERAL PAYMENTS FROM ICE. TO THE SUBCONTRACTORS. EXAMPLE RECENT FEDERAL INSPECTION OF ON THE LAN TOTE DETENTION FACILITY REPORTED ONE SUICIDE AND THREE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS INADEQUATE DENTAL CARE AND CURSORY MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS. TRAGICALLY THE INCIDENTS OFTEN GO UNADDRESSED AND VICTIMS HAVE NO RECOURSE. I A IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO REVIEW THE FACILITIES AND PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE CONDITIONS F CONFINEMENT. A DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA INVESTIGATION AGAIN REVEALED THAT WHEN CONDITIONS IN THE DETENTION FACILITY FALL BELOW PREVAILING LEGAL ANOTHER STANDARDS IT IS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WHO ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO SUFFER THE REASON THE HARMS OF THE HARMS THAT THAT RESULTS? OF PEOPLE HELD AT THE OF THE LAND OR SUBJECTED TO PUNITIVE PRISON LIKE CONDITIONS THAT HARM PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. MY BILL TODAY SIX TWENTY TWO SB SIX WAY TO REQUIRES THEY WILL BE TENSION FACILITIES. TO IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ANY DEATH IN CIVIL CUSTODY. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL ASSUME JURISDICTION OVER THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DEATH. AND IN COORDINATION WITH THE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION IMMEDIATELY OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH WE NEED TRANSPARENCY WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY IN CIVIL DETENTION FACILITIES. CURRENTLY OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES MAKE BILLIONS IN PROFITS EVERY YEAR FROM INCARCERATED MOTHERS FATHERS CHILDREN AND OTHERS. IN A BROKEN IMMIGRATION. SYSTEM IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS ARE CIVIL MATTERS WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL MAY BE DETAINED AS THEY WAIT FOR THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR CASES HOWEVER THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE DETAINED FOR THE IMMIGRATION CASE. AND IN FACT PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN NINETIES MOST WERE NOT DETAINED. OF IT IS EVEN MORE CRUCIAL TODAY THE CALIFORNIANS CYST ON HUMANE AND JUST A TREATMENT IN OUR STATE WITH WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY ARE MELISSA CASTRO FROM LOS ANGELES. AND CLARA OF CLEAR ALONG WITH HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THE FIRST WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THAT AFTERNOON -- AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY MY NAME IS MELISSA CASTRO. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICE. ALSO LISA ABOUT A BOTH SHOW WAS MY HUSBAND AND THE FATHER OF OUR TWO MONTH OLD SON. IN LATE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN HE WAS DETAINED BY ICE AND EVENTUALLY. WAS TAKEN TO THE OTHER LOCAL DETENTION CENTER AND OTHER NON TO CALIFORNIA. FOUR DAYS AFTER GIVING BIRTH I RECEIVED A CALL FROM AYE STATING THAT MY HUSBAND. WAS AT THE LOMA LINDA HOSPITAL DUE TO A PASSING OUT EPISODE. UPON ARRIVAL I WAS INFORMED THAT IN FACT IT WAS ACTUALLY. M. A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE. WHILE HE WAS UNDER ICE CUSTODY AT THE HOSPITAL HE WAS HANDCUFFED TO THE BED BY HIS FOOT. HE HAD TWO GUARDS INSIDE ISRAEL TWENTY FOUR HOURS -- EVEN AFTER I WAS INFORMED THAT HE WAS IN AN INTENSIVE COMO AND PARALYZED. I WAS ALSO INFORMED BY THE GUARDS AND THE DOCTORS THAT THE DOCTORS ARE NOT. ALLOWED TO DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION REGARDING WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE HOSPITAL. AS HIS WIFE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE HE GOT TO THE HOSPITAL. AND WHAT PROTOCOLS ARE TAKEN TO ENSURE YOU RECEIVE THE PROPER CARE. I WAS LATER INFORMED BY THE DOCTORS DURING OUR DISCUSSIONS THAT H WAS ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED FROM A PREVIOUS HOSPITAL THE NIGHT BEFORE. THIS RAID COULD RAISE QUESTIONS FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY FAMILY. WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED IMMEDIATELY UPON? UPON HIS ARRIVAL TO THE FIRST HOSPITAL. WHEN DID THE INITIAL INCIDENT OCCURRED HOW LONG WAS HE AT THE ICE FACILITY BEFORE HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE HOSPITAL? AND WHAT HAPPENED THAT LED ICE TO TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE FEW QUESTIONS THAT TO THIS DAY I STILL DO NOT HAVE ANSWERS. TO MY HUSBAND WAS RELEASED FRM ICE CUSTODY WHILE HE WAS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL. AND CONSCIOUS HE PASSED AWAY TWO WEEKS LATER. AS HIS WIFE AND THE MOTHER TO CHILD IT PAINS ME TO KNOW THAT HE IS NO LONGER HERE WITH US AND THAT HE WON'T EVER BE ABLE TO MEET OUR SON. IT HAS ALSO BEEN HARD BECAUSE LIKE I MENTIONED TO THIS DAY I STILL I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED AND WON'T CLOSURE. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO A FAMILY WHILE. A LOVED ONE IS UNDER ICE BECAUSE CITY. I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK THAT YOU VOTE IN FAVOR FOR THE SENATE BILL. SIX TWENTY TWO AS NO FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO SEE THEIR LOVED ONE AND THOSE CONDITIONS ON THE FINAL HOURS. WE SHOULD ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN OUR SHOW I SUSPECT I SURE IN. EXPRESSING MY CONDOLENCES AND SADNESS OF THIS INCIDENT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE PEOPLE HERE IN THIS ROOM TODAY THANK YOU. SIX WINS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CLARA LONG I'M A SENIOR RESEARCHER WITH HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH. I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT. SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY TWO WHICH WILL ENSURE IF PASSED SWIFT INVESTIGATION TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IF AND WHEN THERE IS ANOTHER DEATH N CIVIL CUSTODY IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING IMMIGRATION DETENTION. AS THE SENATOR NOTED THERE IS A RECORD AND RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING DETAINED NATIONALLY IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION. IN THE IS FEBRUARY PORT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOUNDED THE DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DETAINED. AND WE FOUND THAT HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH THAT SINCE MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND TEN OF EIGHTY TWO DEATHS AN ADULT IMMIGRATION. TWENTY THREE OF THEM -- WERE LINKED -- TO SUB STANDARD NEGLECTFUL MEDICAL CARE THAT'S OUT OF THE FIFTY TWO THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ANALYZE -- THAT WE HAVE THE DOCUMENTS ANALYZE. IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A SMALL TASTE OF WHAT THAT MEANS IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE LIKE MR FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ VALUE VIA HE PASSED AWAY IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHILE THE TEAM THAT THE ADELINE TO DETENTION FACILITY. FROM DELAYS IN ADDRESSING PNEUMONIA WHICH IS A PREVENTABLE AND TREATABLE ILLNESS. MISTER RAHUL AND NESTO MORE DOLLARS RAMOS ALSO DETAIN ADELANTO DETENTION FACILITY SUFFERED SYMPTOMS OF CANCER FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO SEE A DOCTOR IN APRIL. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HE DIED ONLY WEEKS AFTER SEEN HAVING SEEN A DOCTOR SHE REPORTED THAT HE HAD THE LARGEST OF DOMINO MASK SHE'D EVER SEEN IN HER PRACTICE THAT WAS VISIBLE THROUGH HIS ABDOMINAL WALL. MISTER HURTADO CREW SONGES IT DIED WHILE DETAINED BY THE U. S. MARSHALL SERVICE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN THE TIME MASS A DETENTION FACILITY. ACCORDING TO A WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT FILED BY HIS FAMILY HE BEGGED FOR CARE BEFORE HIS DEATH AND WAS ONLY GIVEN ASSISTANCE WHEN AN OFFICER HAPPENED UPON HIM AFTER HE HAD COUGHED UP SO MUCH BLOOD HIS BED SHEETS WERE SOAKED. MORE RECENTLY AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD. THE FAMILY OF MISTER JOSE IE BOTTOM -- STILL IS ASKING FOR ANSWERS AND AS TO WHETHER HE RECEIVED TIMELY AN ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE IN ADELANTO DETENTION FACILITY.

COR OTHERWISE NOT TREATED WITH THE LEVEL OF HUMAN DIGNITY THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT AND DEMAND. OF OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER SO WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK EVERYONE -- SPECIALLY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND COUNSEL FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT -- CHEN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI. JACKSON HI BORDERS. ALAN. ALAN HI COVER EURO. JONES. MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. UMBERG WHITE HOUSE SKI. YOU HAVE THREE VOTES ON THAT MEASURE -- WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN I THINK WE'LL GET MORE THANK YOU FOR COMING IN CONDOLENCES FOR YOUR LOSS. OUR NEXT OF BILL IS SENATOR ROD SHOWS SB SEVEN FORTY NINE FILE ITEM. THIRTY WAIT JUST A SECOND TOO AGAIN ALLOW. OTHERS TO LEAVE BEFORE WE START THE SET UP THERE AND THEN WE'LL HAVE. RIGHT E. L. I. S. B. SEVEN FORTY NINE SEVEN DRAWS SO I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE AMENDING THE BILL AS REFLECTED ON PAGE. ONE OF THE ANALYSIS AND PAGE SEVEN SPECIFICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE SECTION. TO AS REFLECTED IN THE NOTE. ON PAGE ONE OF THE ANALYSIS AND YOU ARE AMENDING THE BILL IS REFLECTED IN THE AMENDMENT ON PAGE. SEVEN TO TIGHTEN UP THE BILL'S LANGUAGE THE PROTECTION PLOY THE NAMES AND PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SEKARANG. YES THAT'S CORRECT I ACCEPT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROCEED FORESHORES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. SB FORTY IN SOME FORTY NINE POSITIONS CALIFORNIA TO BE IT A LEADER AND CREATING GOOD JOBS AND OPEN GOVERNMENT. AS A GLOBAL ECONOMIC LEADER CALIFORNIA'S STRIVES. TO GOVERN FOR THE COMMON GOOD. FOUNDATIONAL TO THIS IDEA THE PRINCIPLE OF PURCHASING FOR THE COMMON GOOD. OUR PUBLIC INVESTMENTS ARE TAX DOLLARS SHOULD STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES AND BUILD OUR COLLECTIVE STRENGTH. HOWEVER WITHOUT ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT WAGES JOB CREATION JOB QUALITY AND JOB RETENTION HOW CAN WE BE POSITIVE. THAT ARE PURCHASING POWER REFLECTS OUR VALUES AND REWARDS RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS EARNING PROFITS WITH OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS. SO SB SEVEN FORTY NINE WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT ALL IT AGAIN MAKE CLEAR. NOT ADDITION NOT A TAKE WEIGHT WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT ALL INFORMATION IN A PUBLIC CONTRACT BETWEEN A PRIVATE INDUSTRY EMPLOYER AND THE STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY PERTAINING TO JOB CREATION. JOB QUALITY OR JOB RETENTION AS WELL AS BY AMERICA LAWS COMPLIANCE. IS NOT EXEMPTED FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AS A TRADE SECRET OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON. AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL BY AMERICA LAWS SB SEVEN FORTY NINE REFLECTS A BIPARTISAN UNDERSTANDING. OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING AMERICAN WORKERS AND MANUFACTURERS -- I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE -- CHAIR -- JACKSON'S EVERY TOWARDS ACHIEVING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND CALIFORNIA'S TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS WHICH DIVERT BILLIONS FOR MY GENERAL FUND EACH YEAR. INCREASINGLY RECORDS RELATED TO WAGES BENEFITS JOB QUALITY RETENTION AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ARE REDACTED FROM PUBLIC DOCUMENTS BY PRIVATE CONTRACTORS AND SUBSIDY RECIPIENTS. BASED ON THE TRADE SECRET EXEMPTION. TO THE C. P. R. A OR ARE PREVENTED FROM BEING DISCLOSED AS A RESULT OF THIRD PARTY LAWSUITS. FOR THIS REASON SB SEVEN FORTY NINE WOULD INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION AND THE GOVERNMENT CODE OF THE TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATED TO JOBS JOB QUALITY JOB RETENTION. THAT PRIVATE CONTRACTORS IN SUBSIDY RECIPIENTS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REDACT FROM PUBLIC DOCUMENTS BASED ON THE TRADE SECRET EXEMPTION. THIS IS A NARROW APPROACH TO INCREASING ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC CONTRACTS AS WELL AS PRIVATE COMPANIES COMPLIANCE WITH BY AMERICA LAWS. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG COMMITTED TO RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTING POLICIES BUT TO ACHIEVE FULLY THE GOALS OF RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTING. ACCESS TO KEY INFORMATION IS VITAL. CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE A FAIR RETURN ON OUR TAXES AND THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF WE ARE GETTING WHAT WE BARGAINED FOR IS GETTING THE INFORMATION RELATED TO JOBS. IN THIS SB SEVEN FORTY NINE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER IN CREATING JOBS AND PROTECTING JOBS QUALITY. TODAY WE HAVE TWO OF THEM. DON YEAH DONALD A TO EXPERT WITNESSES DONALD COLON AND BENJAMIN KAMAL CHECK. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND OUR FIELD EXPERT ABELA SHOT BOLA FROM JOBS TO MOVE AMERICA TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR AND WE'LL START TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE THANK YOU SO. MY NAME IS DON KOHN I RUN A NATIONAL IT -- RESEARCH AND POLICY CENTER AROUND GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WE WORK AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE FIND CASE ON A TALK BROADLY ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TRADE SECRETS WE GET ALL THE TIME WE REGULARLY FIND CASES WHERE PUBLIC INFORMATION IS HIDDEN BECAUSE A CONTRACTOR CLAIMS IT WOULD EXPOSE A TRADE SECRET. AGENCIES OFTEN GO ALONG WITH WHAT THE COMPANY SAYS BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED AND THEY JUST THINK THEY ACCEPT WHAT THEY SAY. SO GROUPS WOULD HAVE TO LITIGATE LIKE LIKE IN A IN CASE YOU HEAR YOUR HILL YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT AND GROUPS DON'T BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE. TO LITIGATE AROUND -- HAVE DETERMINED TO GET THE RECORDS REQUEST. THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE TRADE SECRET ISSUES BUT THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY EXAMPLES THAT WE FINALLY GIVE YOU JUSTA BULLETED FEW WITH THE CLAIM IS AN INAPPROPRIATE. AND TOWARDS THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE TO HOLD CONTRACTORS ACCOUNTABLE AND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING WHAT WE PAY FOR SO HERE JUST A FEW SAMPLES A BROAD BRUSH. IN CONNECTICUT THE HEALTH CARE EXCHANGE CONTRACTED WITH A CONVENTIONAL COMPANY MAXIMUS TO OPERATE THEIR CALL CENTER AFTER OBAMACARE PASSED. IN NPR STATION SUBMITTED A RECORDS REQUEST TO BREAK DOWN THE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE CALL PER MINUTE. FOR THE CHARGE. THE COMPANY CLAIMED THEY WERE TRADE SECRET. I'M NOT GONNA GIVE THE RESULTS OF ALL THESE CASES WERE THERE ALL WE HAVE THE ULTIMATELY RESOLVED. SIMILARLY A PRIVATE WATER COMPANY IN NEW YORK WONDER CHARGE FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR PLANNING AND DESIGN OF A NEW. PLANT AND WATER TREATMENT PLANT THEY WOULDN'T PROVIDE A BREAKDOWN OF THE COST EITHER BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY WERE TO FIND OUT OF UNITS AND AND WE NEEDED TO FIND OUT OF WE WERE THAT WAS THAT RESIDENTS ARE GONNA BE OVER CHARGED. BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT WAS A TRADE SECRET THOSE COSTS IS ALL PUBLIC YOU KNOW PUBLIC GOODS. NEXT STATE OFFICIALS IN NORTH CAROLINA ASKED FOR THE SALARIES OF AN EMPLOYEES OF A PRIVATE CHARTER SCHOOL THE SCHOOL CLAIMED THAT THE SALARIES WERE CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY IN A TRADE SECRET. ULTIMATELY HAD TO GIVE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE NEWSPAPER REQUESTED THE LITIGATION HISTORY OF A HEALTHCARE COMPANY IN FLORIDA THAT CONTRACTED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE IN STATE PRISONS THE COMPANY REFUSED CLAIMING THE INFORMATION WAS A TRADE SECRET. IS ABOUT LITIGATION THAT'S NOT PART OF THEIR SECRET SAUCE TO BE LITIGATED. FINALLY -- AFTER INMATE RIGHTS IN A PRIVATELY RUN PRISON IN TEXAS THE ACLU FILED A REQUEST FOR ON DOCUMENTS FOR PRISONER HEALTH. IS NO COMPLAINTS AND DEATHS. AND THE COMPANY THEN SAID THAT WAS A TRADE SECRET ALSO HARD TO IMAGINE RIGHT. SO SB SEMPER NINE DOESN'T ADDRESS ALL OF THIS IT'S AND IT'S A NARROW. START TO ADDRESS ONE THAT THE UNIT TO CLARIFY ERA WHAT TO WRITE. US A WEIRD YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BANK OF ALL CHECK I'M AN ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY WITH A LOT FOR MCCRACKEN'S TIMMERMAN AND HOLES VERY -- THE CALIFORNIA PBLIC RECORDS ACT AS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ENSURING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY IN CALIFORNIA ARE AS YOU'VE HEARD BECOME A PRACTICE OF PART OF PRIVATE COMPANIES. TO SUE AGENCIES TO BLOCK DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE RECORDS THEY CLAIM OUR TRADE SECRETS. RECENTLY NEW FIRE THE LARGEST BUS MANUFACTURER IN NORTH AMERICA I TEND TO USE THIS TECHNIQUE TO CONCEAL INFORMATION ABOUT WAGE BENEFIT AND JOB CREATION PROMISES. IN MADE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT FROM LOS ANGELES METRO. THE ABILITY FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES TO PURSUE COSTLY LITIGATION IN RESPONSE THE CPR I REQUEST MUSCLES THE PUBLIC OUT OF UTILIZING THE CPR AND FURTHER PUBLIC GENCIES ARE LIKEWISE FORCE INTO A DIFFICULT POSITION. BETWEEN THEIR CPR A. R. BUT OBLIGATIONS AND THE THREAT OF THIRD PARTY LITIGATION. SB SEVEN FORTY NINE NARROWLY ADDRESSES THIS BY CLARIFYING THE TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATED TO JOBS JOB QUALITY PROCUREMENT THAT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE TRADE SECRET EXEMPTION TO THE CPR AT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE EXISTING DECISIONAL Là -- THE BY CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE EXEMPTIONS FROM COMPEL DISCLOSURE -- MUST BE NARROWLY CONSTRUED NO CORPS IN CALIFORNIA'S FOUND THAT THE CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS INCLUDING SB SEVEN FORTY NINE R. TRADE SECRETS UNDER THE CPR A EVEN IF IT COULD BE CONSIDERED TRADE SECRET ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS ARE. A DOCUMENT WHEN THESE CATEGORIES UNDER THE CPR A YOU MUST BALANCE THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DISCLOSURE AGAINST THE CLAIM CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION. THE PUBLIC INTEREST STRONGLY SUPPORTS DISCLOSURE OF THESE CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS CONCLUDED THAT ACCESS TO BID DOCUMENTS. IS REQUIRED OF THE CPR A CALIFORNIA HAS A STRONG PUBLIC POLICY AGAINST CONFIDENTIALITY EMPLOYEE WAGES AND COURSE OF REGULARLY HELD -- THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUBMITTED TO THE GOVERNMENT IS THIS CLOSABLE. IN THE LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY NEW FLYER THIS WAS EXACTLY THE REASON WHY THE ORDER DISCLOSURE OF THE DOCUMENTS. SIMILARLY THE CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS INCLUDED IN SB SEVEN FORTY NINE ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE PROMISES MADE TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES OUR CAT. THANK YOU INTO JUST A TAD OVER WELL DONE ARE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE STEP FOR OUR GIVE US YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS HI MY NAME IS AVAILABLE I'M WITH JOBS TO MOVE AMERICA AND I'M ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- AND I JOBS MOVE AMERICA IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION AND WE'RE DEDICATED TO ADVOCATING FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES TO PURCHASE FOR THE COMMON GOOD MEANING THAT TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT -- ON WHEN TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT ON YOU GOODS AND SERVICES THE SHOULD BE LEVERAGED TO CREATE GOOD JOBS FOR SYSTEMS IMPACTED GROUPS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

THE FRONT TABLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. YOU CAN COME BACK IF THERE'S QUESTIONS DURING THE QUESTIONING. THANK YOU TWO WITNESSES EACH TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB -- SEVEN FORTY NINE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL -- ACTUALLY BROADENS THE APPLICATION OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT NOT JUST THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MAINTAINED AND OWNED AND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO IN BATES NOW PUBLIC ARE EXCUSE ME PRIVATE EMPLOYERS -- PRIVATE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN THE POSSESSION MAINTAINED AND OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY IT'S NOW INVADING INTO A PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS DOCUMENTS -- THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY TRADE SECRETS AND SO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WE'RE BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THE CPR A TO THOSE PROP PRIVATE DOCUMENTS THAT SHOULD BE DISCLOSED AS A PART OF THE GOVERNMENT. TRADE SECRETS -- I'M NOT SUGGESTING UP HERE THAT AN EMPLOYEE RECORDS ARE EMPLOYEE WAGES ARE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE CONSIDERED TREAT SECRET INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTS REGARDING JOB RETENTION -- JOB CREATION JOB QUALITY YOU'RE GOING TO BE TRADE SECRETS BUT THAT'S REALLY FOR THE TRIER OF FACT TO DETERMINE AND NOT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO NECESSARY. WYRLEY DETERMINED THAT THEY CAN NEVER BE TRADE SECRET INFORMATION TRADE SECRET INFORMATION -- THE WHOLE BIT -- PURPOSE OF TRADE SECRETS ARE IT IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT DERIVES ECONOMIC VALUE FROM BEING MAINTAINED AS CONFIDENTIAL AND IF IT'S AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS IS ESSENTIALLY THE GOVERNMENT COMING IN AND SAYING. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THIS IS A TRADE SECRET REQUIRING DISCLOSURE NOW YOU'VE LOST ANY ECONOMIC VALUE HAVING MAINTAINING ITS CONFIDENCE AND SO YOU CAN'T MAINTAIN THIS AS A TRADE SECRET ANY LONGER WITH THE WHICH IS A CONCERN FOR OUR PERSPECTIVE. IF THEY ARE ALLEGING TREAT SECRET THAN WHAT THE TRIER OF FACT DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT TREATS A GROUP PRIVILEGE IS IN FACT VALID AND WHETHER OR NOT IT DOES SATISFIED THE QUALIFICATIONS OF A TRADE SECRET. BUT JUST UNILATERALLY ASSUMING THAT IT NEVER DOES IS A CONCERN AND AGAIN THESE KIND OF CHALLENGES WITH REGARDS TO DISCLOSING PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO THE CPR A UNILATERALLY DETERMINING THAT THIS INFORMATION IS NOT A TRADE SECRET. WILL CREATE OBSTACLES FOR THESE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS WANTING TO CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND CREATE CHALLENGES FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY AND GET THESE PROCUREMENTS -- CONTRACTS AS WELL SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED [inaudible] YOU -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEAL GIVES WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE SIGNIFICAN AMENDMENTS REMOVING SECTION. TO THAT ADDRESSES THE THE MAJORITY OF OUR CONCERNS -- AND WILL BE EVALUATING OUR POSITION ON THIS BILL SHOULD HAVE MOVED FORWARD -- HOWEVER I KNOW THAT WE DO WE ARE A MEMBERS STILL HAVE SOME REMAINING CONCERNS ON ON HOW THIS WILL IMPACT. OUR ABILITY TO CONTRACT -- AND AND GO OUT TO TO BID ON PROJECTS ARE WE GOING TO RECEIVE LESS BIDS BECAUSE BUSINESSES ARE. ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED -- SHOULD THIS BILL GO THROUGH SO WE STILL HAVE THOSE CONCERNS BUT THE THE THE MAJORITY OF OF OUR CONCERNS WOULD WITH REGARD TO DIVERSITY P. R. A.. ACTIONS IS BEEN REMOVED AND BEEN ADDRESSED. EVERY WE HAVE FOLKS ARE COMING FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND OTHERS -- YEAH THE THE USING ON BEHALF GOING TO BE SAYING THAT THE SAME POSITION THAT THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE AT THEY'LL COULD WILL HERE THERE'S AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE DíAS. OKAY I UNDERSTAND OKAY. WOULD YOU SAID IN A PLAYER AFFILIATION A YES SO AGAIN DON'T GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. OKAY NOW GO TO OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME ANDAFFILIATION IN WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS WE WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE BY. THE FDA ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES ALTHOUGH I'M NOT WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE SO I CANNOT ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS THANK YOU. A MISTER CHAIR CRISPY KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE AS OUTLINED BY MISTER WITH THE CAL CHAMBER THANK YOU. KAREN MEMBERS CORE ENGINE SO A TECHNICIAN ALSO LINE OF THE CHAMBER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS MEMBER QUESTIONS [inaudible] YEAH. THOSE SENATOR CAFIERO THEN SENATOR ALLEN. YOU IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY ASK COUPLE QUESTIONS -- I I AM I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING IN AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET -- THERE'S THERE IS ONE SECTION THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN TELL ME. WHAT THIS MEANS AND SO THERE ARE? ACTUALLY PULLED IT UP IN THE BILL IT IS. IT IS ON PAGE THREE LINE. THREE AND THIS IS THIS IS THE SECTION IT'LL BE ADDED TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE. SO THERE'S IT'S A IT'S SUBSECTION BE IN AND IT READS NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW RECORDS OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE MYSTIC CONTENT REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN SECTION FIFTY THREE TWENTY THREE J. OF TITLE. FORTY NINE UNITED STATES CODE OR WITH ANY STATE OR LOCAL LAW MANDATING DOMESTIC CONTENT IN STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY PROCUREMENT. OR LIMITING OR PROHIBITING THE USE OF ARTICLES MATERIALS OR SUPPLIES. MINED PRODUCED OR MANUFACTURED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES OUR PUBLIC RECORDS AND ARE NOT TRADE SECRETS FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CHAPTER AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE SO. THAT THEM THE EMPLOYEES IN THE ROOM ID THAT HOW MUCH THEY'RE MAKING AND ALL THAT KIND OF GOOD STUFF MAKES SENSE TO ME BUT THAT. IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU INTEND BY THAT. ABSOLUTELY THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- SO THAT'S JUST ONE REFERENCE THE FEDERAL CODE TO ONE PROCUREMENT Là THAT'S THE BY AMERICA PROGRAM -- AND THAT IS FROM THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION FOR GRANTS THAT -- THAT -- DEPARTMENT GIVES TO LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES -- WHERE THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS ATTACHED TO GRANTS OF A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT THE REQUIRES STEEL AND OTHER-- CONTENT TO BE PROCURED FROM -- TO BE PROCURED DOMESTICALLY THAT'S THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE THE BROADER PROVISION JUST MEANS -- THAT THERE ARE STATE AND LOCAL LAWS THAT SIMILARLY REQUIRE -- PROCUREMENT TO TAKE PLACE IN A CERTAIN WAY YOU KNOW BE -- BY AMERICA -- ANTI SWEATSHOP THINGS LIKE THAT -- SO THAT'S WHAT THAT -- SECTION APPLIES. TO YOUR STAND IS THAT IS YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T. PAY ATTENTION TO THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT LATER COME BACK AND I WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IS IS I UNDERSTAND CONTRACTS WHERE -- WHERE YOU HAVE -- PEOPLE WORKING BUT IF YOU'RE BUYING MATERIALS AND GOODS. THEN -- THEN I'M CONCERNED ABOUT -- EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ARTICULATING HAS TO BE DISCLOSED. IN THIS -- AT NEW LAW I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT IT'S ONLY PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT A CONTRACT OR LAW. IT DOESN'T SAY IF YOU IF THERE'S NO APPLICABLE PROCUREMENT Là. THERE'S NO. REQUIREMENT THAT DOCUMENTS BE DISCLOSED UNDER THIS -- AND THIS PROVISION BUT IF WE ARE LEGISLATING. TO PROCURE IN A WAY THAT WE THAT WE WANT TO SEE BENEFITS GO TO OUR COMMUNITIES THIS JUST SAYS. THE RECORDS OF COMPLIANCE TO THOSE LAWS AND AGREEMENTS ARE NOT TRADE SECRETS. AND I'D I ALSO WANT TO SAY I I DON'T THINK THAT THIS EXPAND THE DEFINITION UNDER EXISTING DECISIONAL Là. I THINK THOSE DOCUMENTSARE GENERALLY ALREADY AVAILABLE THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT NOW. REQUESTED ARE BEING FORCED INTO A MULTI YEARS OF LITIGATION IN ORDER TO GET THOSE DOCUMENTS. IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN INFORMAL TEN DAY. OUR RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS. AND WE ARE JUST PROVIDING LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE TO THE KIND OF DOCUMENTS THAT THOSE -- AGENCIES NEED -- TO TURN OVER I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THIS IS THAT I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN THINKING THERE I'M THINKING LOCAL GOVERNMENT KIND OF CONTRACTS AT THE YOU KNOW. FIX THE ROAD DO SOME WORK AROUND THE COMMUNITY -- THE STATE CONTRACTS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH COMPANIES THAT DO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND WE AND I'M THINKING IN PARTICULAR IN THE HIGH TECH AND THAT AND THAT -- THAT -- THE HIGH TECH AND ALSO THAT THE VEHICLES AND THE THE HELICOPTERS AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT WE BY -- I'M I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE NOW SAYING IS GOING TO BE -- AVAILABLE AND LIKE I SAID I LIKE THE CONCEPT AND IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL CONCRETE -- PROJECTS THAT YOU DO IT LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT AT THE STATE LEVEL I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW FAR HOW BROADER WE GOING WITH THIS. AND THEN WHAT ARE WE WHAT KIND OF BURDENS ARE WE PUTTING. ON THE NOT ONLY THAT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE CONTRACTING WITH AND AND AND FRANKLY PART OF THE CHALLENGES IS SOMETIMES OUR SPECIFICATIONS ARE SO DETAILED. THAT THEY CAN'T MEET THE SPECIFICATIONS AND WE END UP WITH ONE VENDOR. AND AND SO DO WE THEN PLACE OURSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE WE END UP WITH NO VENDORS THAT ARE BIDDING BECAUSE OUR REQUIREMENTS YOUR TIME JUST TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT MOST CONTRACTSDON'T INCLUDE DOMESTIC CONTENT. PROVISIONS. IT DOESN'T OPEN UP -- EVERY SINGLE AGREEMENT OR CONTRACT. IT IS APPLIED TO OUR THAT WHEN THERE IS A REQUEST FOR A SPECIFIC. CONTRACT HAS IT BEEN -- DETERMINED TO INCLUDE ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS. THAT SAYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YOUR CONTENT IS SAFE AND TO ACQUIRED LOCALLY. THEN THOSE RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER THE CPR A IT'S NOT EVERY CONTRACT. IF I COULD IF I COULD ADD HIS I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I CAN MAKE EXPLAINED DIFFERENT. IF THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS. THEN THERE COMPLIANCE REPORTS HAVE TO BE PUBLIC SO THAT WE CAN SAY YOU ARE YOU DOING IT OR NOT IT'S NOT ADDING NEW REQUIREMENTS. IT'S THAT'S ALL. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER AROUND DID YOU WANNA TRY TO GET A QUESTION ENOUGH THIS THING RIGHT AFTER A QUICK FOR SECOND BUT I I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE THE ON YOUR ON YOUR QUESTION YOUR POINT. WHAT IS THE CORE CONCERN RIGHT NOW SO I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR IS IS WORKING WITH OUR OUR CITIES I MEAN ULTIMATELY [inaudible] YOU KNOW. THE FALL PUBLIC AGENCIES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ARE ARE USING THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS WHILE THE PROVIDE GOOD PUBLIC SERVICES SO -- WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE REMAINING AQUINNAH CORE CONCERNS FOR OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES SO AGAIN IT'S WHAT WE GO A WEEK WE CONTRACT FOR A LOT OF VERY SERVICES -- IT COULD BE FOR EMPLOYEES FOR CERTAIN PROJECT TO COULD BE TO DO A PROJECT -- THE FORD SOME OF OUR SOME SMALLER SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ONE OR TWO EMPLOYEES -- VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING THAT THAT THEY'RE DOING IS A A CONTRACT OF SOME% KIND. THE FEAR IS THAT THE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT WOULD BID ON THE PROJECTS WERE PUTTING OUT FOR BID. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SUBJECT TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS -- THAT THAT ARE. THE RESULT OF THIS BILL -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE WE RECEIVED RIGHT NOW IN CONTRACTS IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHERE FOLKS SHOULD RIGHT ON IN THE IN ON THE CONTRACT -- THIS IS A TRADE SECRET BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE US IS IS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN WHEN WE GO THROUGH THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS ON WHICH BITS WE'RE GOING TO PROVE OR NOT. SO THE RESULT IS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE LESS FOLKS SUBMITTING BIDS OR THERE'S GOING TO BE LESS INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE BIZ FOR US TO MAKE THAT DECISION. NOW IT I'M NOT SURE HOW DRAMATIC THIS IS GOING TO BE BUT IS A GOOD IT IS A CONCERN AND THAT'S WHAT SAID WHERE WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE OUR POSITION ON THIS BILL. AFTER THIS COMMITTEE THE MEMBERS ARE ARE ARE NEW IS FAR AS REMOVING SECTION TWO WHICH IS OUR MAJOR CONCERN. THE LITIGATION COSTS BUT IT'S UP TO THE WE'RE WE'RE WE AT I NEED TO GO TO MY MEMBERSHIP TASK. IS THIS IS A MATTER OF A NEW MEMBER. I OKAY YES SIR DID YOU WANNA YEAH INTO THE CHURCH I MEAN THERE'S TWO ISSUES RAISED THE LITIGATION ISSUE IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE. THAT'S THE FIRST THING RIGHT NOW PUBLIC INTEREST GROUP A GROUP LIKE MINE IF THE IF AN AGENCY IF A COMPANY SAYS IT'S A TRADE SECRET EVEN AND THEY NOTED IN THEIR DOCUMENT. BUT IT'S NOT A TRADE SECRET OR WE ARE THE PUBLIC A WE DETERMINE IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE. WE OFTEN HAVE TO SUE TO GET IT AND WE ARE THE MONEY TO DO THAT SO THAT'S LITIGATION CHAU TRAN TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE IN A VERY TO CLARIFY A VERY NARROW SET OF THINGS. ON THE COMPANIES WON'T BID I JUST WANTED TO SAY I HAVE BEEN A PART OF MANY MANY ADVOCATE CAMPAIGNS AND LAWS OVER THE YEARS DOMESTIC CONTENT LIVING WAGE -- DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP. THIS THE EXACT SAME THING IS SAID EVERY TIME I MIDDLE FOR A CUP OF CROSS THE COUNTRY NOBODY WILL BID. THEY SAID THAT IT LE LA ACTS WHICH I FLY IN AND OUT OF TOO FREQUENTLY. THAT'S A NOBODY WILL BE JUST WORRIED ABOUT AGAIN I'M JUST SAYING BUT WHAT YOU GET A MUCH I'M TELL YOU THE LA X. EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL NEVER BID. FOR THE ON THE LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS -- IN THE AIRPORT FOR THE VENDORS FOR THE CONCESSIONAIRES E NOW HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES THAT WE HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE. A GROUP OF CONTRACT SUBCONTRACTORS AND BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS THAN EVER BEFORE. SO IN FACT IT DOES QUITE THE CONTRARY THE CREATES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND TRANSPARENCY THE PEOPLE CAN BID THE PEOPLE AND UPDATING IN. MORE IS OUR EXPERIENCE. RIGHT. AT THE OTHER. ONE I WANT. OKAY I JUST THE ISSUE WE WANT. THEY HAVE -- TO WHAT THEY AGREE WHEN A COMPANY AGREES AND GETS INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH US WITH THE STATE RIGHT. THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DO CERTAIN THINGS. WE WANT THE THE COMPLIANCE WE WANT THAT INFORMATION WE WANT TO KNOW THAT IN FACT THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING IT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US SHOULD WANT THAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY. A SENATOR STERN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- JUST TO RUN THROUGH A FEW EXAMPLES I GET MY HEAD WRAPPED AROUND WHERE THIS MIGHT APPLY AND WE'RE NOT -- FILM TAX CREDIT. CALIFORNIA FILM TAX CREDIT WE WE THERE'S JOBS REQUIREMENTS AND THERE IS THIS. THIS IS IN THIS IS IN THE SCOPE OF THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THEN. WE HAVE A I THINK A BY CLEAN AND WE'VE NEVER THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD AND PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL IN NOBODY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HAS EVER SAID. THAT'S A TRADE SECRET AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY WITH THE LEGISLATURE SAYS THAT WE WANT TO SEE THE JOB BEFORE YOU YOU KNOW WE GIVE YOU THE TAX CREDIT -- BUT WHAT ABOUT -- THE THE THE THE THERE'S A BITE I THINK IS A BONTA BILL A BOT BY CLEAN PROVISION ABOUT AND SORT OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS DO YOU KNOW IN THIS THAT THAT CONTEXT. FOR GREENHOUSE GAS RELATED I THINK YOU'VE GOT A BY YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT. COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY GOING TO BE NOT GENERALLY ARE GOING TO BE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE JUST CLOSABLE UNDER THE CPR ATHE ISSUE IS WHETHER WE HAVE TO GO TO YEARS OF LITIGATION RIGHT I REALLY SENSITIVE TO THE PUBLIC AGENCIES. SIDE OF THIS I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE RIGHT NOW IF THEY GET A GOVERNMENT RECORDS REQUESTS. THEY HAVE TO DO THIS DIFFICULT ANALYSIS AND THEY'RE FORCED TO DECIDE BETWEEN THEIR REQUIREMENTS OBLIGATIONS ON THE CPR A AND THE THREAT OF A THIRD PARTY LAWSUIT. NOW THEY DON'T. RIGHT AND INDIVIDUAL FIRE EXACTLY NEW FLYER LOST EVENTUALLY BUT YOU'RE SAYING WE HAD A SCRAPPY NONPROFIT TO HAD TO DO OVER TWO YEARS OF LITIGATION. TO GET BASIC RECORDS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROGRAM THERE WAS REQUIRED TO BE INCLUDED INTO A FIVE HER MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT A PROMISE WAS MADE. AND AND I AGAIN. THAT THAT. LAWSUIT THE ANALYSIS OF THE COURT WAS SPOT ON THESE ARE CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS. ARE ALREADY DISCLOSE BORN OF THE CPR IT IT JUST DOES THE DOES THE PUBLIC AGENCY HAVE TO DO THAT ANALYSIS IN THE POTENTIALLY BE SUED AND YOU DON'T ANSWER THIS ONE TODAY BUT IN JUST OF THE LAST EXAMPLE WE JUST HAD A LONG HEARING ABOUT OVERHAULING THE DMV. AND ALL THE PROCUREMENT THEY WERE GOING THROUGH EVEN IS GET THEM TO USE A CREDIT CARD AT THE DMV IS I THINK THAT'S AN ACTIVE THERE'S ACTIVE SOLICITATION SOME KIND ARE IF -- I THINK IS OUT ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW ON THAT. IF THERE AREN'T. IF THERE AREN'T SORT OF PROCUREMENT STANDARDS ALREADY BUILT INTO LAW THAT SAY WHAT KIND OF JOBS YOU'VE GOT TO DELIVER OR OTHER WAGE REQUIREMENTS. THEN THIS DOESN'T APPLY IT'S IT'S ONLY SORT OF FOR THE IN FISCAL DOESN'T TOUCH THAT. OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. SENATOR TO RAZA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

ON THEIR EFFORTS TO PROCURE GOODS AND SERVICES FROM DIVERSE BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE TRANSPARENCY ACHIEVED THROUGH THE SURVEY. HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSE. CONTRACTING WITH AN INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS A RESULT CALIFORNIANS INSURANCE PROCUREMENT WITH DIVERSE HOME BUSINESSES. ROSE BY 93% OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS SB. FIVE FIVE THREE FOUR INSURERS THAT THIS DATA CAN CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTED INCLUDES. DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED SUCH AS THE LGBT AND ARE VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES.

ENTIRELY VOLUNTARILY AND GIVES EACH BOARD MEMBER THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELF REPORT THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION TO THE APARTMENT OF INSURANCE. I IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IT WAS REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT 80% OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES GOVERNING BOARD SEATS WERE HELD BY MEN IN ONLY 12% OF THOSE BOARDS. OUR SEATS WERE HELD BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND OF THE NEARLY TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED PORTS SHEETS ONLY FOURTEEN MEMBERS SELF IDENTIFIED AS LGBT. 13% REPORTED ZERO WOMEN. AND 35% REPORTED ZERO PEOPLE OF COLOR ON THEIR GOVERNING BOARDS RESEARCH SHOWS THE BOARD TO BETTER EQUIPPED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND CARRY OUT THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES WHEN THEY HAVE A DIVERSE MIX OF BOARD MEMBERS FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS EXPERIENCES IN COMMUNITIES.

A GOOD AFTERNOON SERIN TAYLOR WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION CALIFORNIA ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE IN WE HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN THE AUTHOR AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM SO MARK. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN BETWEEN IN BETWEEN. NO TWEENER SNOW OPPOSITION OF QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS SENATOR BORCHERS -- WE'D WE DEALT WITH THIS -- BRIEF I THINK THIS WAS AN INSURANCE BEFORE -- SOMETHING STRUCK ME -- AGE TO WORK AT A WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT LAW FIRMS -- THERE WAS ONE THAT I WAS RESEARCHING -- GO IN DETAIL. I CAME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT'S THAT TALKED ABOUT HOW DIVERSE THIS LAW FIRM WAS. IN FACT THEY HAD ALL SORTS OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN ATTORNEYS WORKING THERE. BUT THAT ASIDE I GO OVER THERE I AND THEN EVENTUALLY END UP WORKING THERE. THERE WERE NO AFRICAN AMERICAN ATTORNEYS THERE. WAS COMPLETE BALONEY. I GUESS I'M WITH. THREE ONE EDGE THAT STRUCK ME IS. IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE WORK FORCE AND GIVEN -- THE GIVEN ENERGY. I POSE THIS QUESTION TO YOU LAST AMERICAN ONE JUST FIGURED OUT A LITTLE BIT. IS THAT IF AN INDIVIDUAL. I WITH THE INDIVIDUAL BE UNDER ANY PRESSURE [inaudible] IF. EITHER THERE -- IN LGBT COMMUNITY OR IF THEIR MINORITY. TO REVEAL THEMSELVES OR IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. ARE HERE OR FUEL PRESSURE THAT THE OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO BE COUNTED. TO MAKE THE INSTITUTION LOOK BETTER. IN TERMS OF ITS HIRING AND IT'S DIVERSITY PROFILE. I AS YOU SAID IT'S REALLY IT'S ONLY IF THEY DECIDED TO IT THEMSELVES WHAT ABOUT THE INTERNAL PRESSURE. WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE INTERNAL PRESSURE I WOULD HOLD THAT -- AN EMPLOYER WOULDN'T FOR SOMEONE TO DISCLOSE SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH I MEAN I HOPE. IT WE WOULD MAINTAIN INTEGRITY OF THAT FREEDOM -- TO ALLOW THEM THE STATE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I MEAN WHETHER YOU'RE IDENTIFYING YOUR RACE OR YOUR GENDER OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE SO THIS BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS THAT BUT IT SPEAKS TO AGAIN A GATHERING THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED -- TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER NOT NECESSARILY FORCING SOMEONE TO REVEAL SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH. IS THE BILL MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE THAT THE INSURER OF THE INFORMATION IS TO BE VOLUNTARILY REPORTED AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFYING THAT AS WELL SO IT IS INVOLUNTARY. AND THE THIRD IS NO ADVERSE ACTION THAT CAN BE TAKEN BY THE BOARD SO THAT'S THE NEXT STEP SO THERE IS. ARGUABLY. ADVERSE ACTION TAKEN YOU HAVE THE A RETALIATION CLAIM IF IF SOMETHING DOES OCCUR SO I THINK THEY CAPTURED IT AND HOPEFULLY. THE SPIRIT AND THE INTENT OF THIS WILL BE. UNDERSTOOD BY THE BOARD. AND IF NOT THEN YOU KNOW LITIGATION GOOD OLE LITIGATION CAN ENSUE IF SOMEONE'S RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. SEEING NONE SENATOR BRADFORD THERE'S A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN THIS IS A VOLUNTARY MEASURE AND WE'VE SEEN THE SUCCESS OF THIS MEASURE OVER THE LAST. EIGHT YEARS THAT IT HAS BEEN IN PLACE -- WE'VE SEEN THE SUCCESS IN UTILITY SPACE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WITH SUPPLIER DIVERSITY ENERGY IN ORDER ONE FIFTY SIX WERE. THIS YEAR WILL REPRISE APPROACH A BILLION DOLLARS TO SPEND AND WITH THE MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED COMPANIES AND I THINK THE SAME SUCCESS AN OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT'S STILL PRETTY MUCH -- EXCLUDED FROM ARE REAL DIVERSITIES SO -- WITH THAT KNOW WHAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS ALAN. CABALLERO. CABALLERO I'D JONES [inaudible] MONNING. MONEY AYE STERN.

ALL RIGHT NEXT UP IS SENATOR GLAZER TO LEAVE FROM THE PRIOR -- THE BILL SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME QUIET SENATOR GLAZER -- IS GOING TO BE PRESENTING SB SIX TWENTY ONE I WOULD LIKE TO ACQUIRE. I KNOW THAT -- SENATOR ALLEN -- INDICATED THAT. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN US HE Q. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY LAST WEEKEND HE DID REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT THAT I KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT. PRIOR TO THIS PROCEEDING -- I'M ASSUMING HE'LL BE BACK TO ASK YOU ABOUT IT BUT I'M HOPING THAT THAT IS AN AMENDMENT -- THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO TAKE AS WELL AS SAD THOUGH IF YOU COULD GIVE US AN INDICATION OF WHERE YOU STAND ON I HAVEN'T SEEN THE OF THEM AT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE AMENDMENT. I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SENATOR ALLEN BUT I'VE NOT SEEN THEM NOW. ALL RIGHT BASED UPON YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH SENATOR ALLEN ARE YOU PREPARED. TO ACCEPT AN AMENDMENT THAT -- INCLUDES THE PROVISIONS THAT HE IS DISCUSSED WITH YOU. MADAM CHAIR IHAVEN'T SEEN THE AMENDMENTS IN WRITING I'VE HAD YEAH GENERAL BROAD CONVERSATION WITH HIM HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION HERE TODAY OF COURSE. BUT I I'LL ASKING ME TO AGREE TO SOMETHING I HAVEN'T SEEN OKAY JUST THE CONCEPT NOT NECESSARILY THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT IT MAY. INFLUENCE SOME OF THE OTHER. OF VOTES HERE. YEAH -- BUT WE SHOULD HAVE THE CONVERSATION FRAZIER ABSOLUTE RIGHT GOOD WE WILL DO THAT THEN. SO -- I DON'T KNOW WHERE SENATOR ALLEN IS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT HE WANTED TO HAVE THAT. DISCUSSION AND I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IT AS WELL MEANWHILE -- THIS OF MEASURE IS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. THE AS AMENDED TO SENATOR PROBE SO WOULD YOU ARTICULATE FIRST THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE ALREADY PREPARED TO TAKE. ABSOLUTELY AT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU YOU AYE MADAM CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE BILL -- THE TWO AMENDMENTS THAT I'VE AGREED TO ACCEPT OUR AN AMENDMENT THAT ELIMINATES THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PROVISION OF THE BILL. AND NUMBER TWO ADDING A RESEARCH COMPONENT TO THE BILL -- SO THOSE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED I THINK ARE DETAILED IN THE ANALYSIS AND I'M PREPARED TO ACCEPT BOTH OF THOSE TODAY. ALL RIGHT IF YOU LIKE TO PROCEED. OKAY. VERY GOOD WELL AT SB SIX TWENTY ONE WOULD DO FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHAT WE HAVE DONE -- FOR BILLIONAIRES AND THEIR SPORTS ARENAS AND EVEN FOR OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE PARKING STRUCTURE OVER THE PAST DECADE. BY PROVIDING JUDICIAL STREAMLINING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT MEET CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE STANDARDS IN JUST A MOMENT. DURING HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS GOVERNOR NEWSOME SAID QUOTE IN RECENT YEARS. WITH EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW ON SEQUEL FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TIME TO DO THE SAME THING FOR HOUSING AND QUOTE. SB. SIX TWENTY TWENTY ONE DOES JUST THAT. THE END IN FACT THE CALIFORNIAN VIRAL QUALITY ACT IS THE HALLMARK OF CALIFORNIA'S DEDICATION TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. AND OUR STATE'S BROADEST ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. THIS BILL OF HOLDS ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS ALL OF THEM. AND THE REVIEWS THAT ARE IN THIS SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS. DOES NOT LIMIT PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO OBJECTIVE PROJECTS UNDERSEA QUITE NOR DOES IT GRANT ANY NEW EXEMPTION NO NEW EXEMPTIONS TO SEE QUOTE. THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC INPUT DEVELOPING AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. AND THE ABILITY TO CHALLENGE A PROJECT ALL REMAIN INTACT. THIS BILL SIMPLY ESTABLISHES A SET TIME PERIOD IN WHICH THE COURT OVERSEEING A SECRET CHALLENGE WHICH MANY FOLKS SAY ARE VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. I IT JUST SETS A TIMELINE FOR WHEN THOSE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES TO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT AS DEFINED IN THIS BILL MUST BE COMPLETED. FURTHERMORE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE LAST COMMITTEE MAKE SURE THAT THE PROJECT. THAT USE THE STREAMLINING. MEET THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS INCLUDING BEING NEAR MAJOR TRANSIT STOPS AND COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY BUILDING STANDARDS -- THE PROCESS THAT'S CREATED BY THIS BILL CREATES MORE LEGAL CERTAINTY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. WHILE ADVANCING THE KIND OF PROJECTS THE STATE IS FOUND TO BE INCLUSIVE AND SAFE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. BILLS IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF HOUSING ADVOCATES NONPROFITS AND BUSINESS GROUPS. AND WITH THAT -- MADAM CHAIR I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I HAVE KATHY GILL SINGH HERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY TO SHARE THOUGHTS AS WELL. AND I THINK OFFICIALLY GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CASSIE GILSON HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND ALSO THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I'M SO MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE AROUND SEQUIN IN THIS BUILDING IS COUCHED IN HYPERBOLE REALLY ON BOTH SIDES AND THIS BILL. I THINK STUDIOUSLY AVOIDS THAT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING VERY VERY NARROW WHICH IS TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTION THAT HAS BEEN LAID OUT BY THIS COMMITTEE BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE AND INDEED THE LEGISLATURE AND SAY. FOR SOME PROJECTS WHICH ARE REALLY THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST WE WOULD LIKE THE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION AROUND THOSE PROJECTS TO HAPPEN AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE AND AS THE SENATOR. SAID THIS ISN'T JUST ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WITH MY SEE I HAD ON I WOULD MAKE IT. AN ARGUMENT FOR WHY IT OUGHT TO BE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT SAYS JUST THE VERY BEST THAT A. R.. TRANSIT ORIENTED THAT ARE SMALL THAT ARE IN FILL THAT HAVE AFFORDABILITY COMPONENTS TO THEM AND THAT MEET A LEED GOLD STANDARD SO ONE OF THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WE HAVE FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THOSE PROJECTS HAVE GONE THROUGH A FULL AND THOROUGH SEEK REVIEW AND COMPLIED WITH ALL THE APPLICABLES ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND ALSO HOLD UP? THE SEQUENCE CRITICAL PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT STANDPOINT SO SORT OF ANTICIPATING CRITICISM THAT SOME OF MY DEAR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES THAT REPRESENT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE ALL OF PEAK OF SEQUENCE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT -- OFFICES ARE PRESERVED AND MAINTAINED IN THIS BUT THOSE BILLS ONCE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS SAID WE WANT THIS VERY HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT AND WE'RE APPROVING IT. IT DOESN'T CONSTRAINED ANYBODY'S ABILITY TO CHALLENGE THAT DECISION IT JUST SAYS WHEN IT GETS TO THE COURTS GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS WE HAVE NOW WE'RE ASKING YOU. TO APPROVE IT QUICKLY -- AND AND I WILL SAY THAT IT IT ALSO IMPORTANTLY GIVES THE LEAVES THE DISCRETION WITH THE COURTS THAT SAYS IF FEASIBLE WE'D LIKE YOU TO APPROVE THIS QUICKLY SO. THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN SEE THEIR DOCKET AND MANAGE IT APPROPRIATELY BUT AGAIN GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE HOUSING. CRISIS I THINK THIS TELLS THEM THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES THAT AND WOULD LIKE THEM IF POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS LITIGATION ALONG QUICKLY SO A VERY NARROW BILL THAT REALLY TRIES TO FOLLOW. THE GUIDANCE AT THIS COMMITTEE AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE SET OUT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON OUT OF WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT THANKS THANK YOU. DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JERRY I CAL HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COME FORWARD [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. TWO MINUTES. TO WITNESSES -- MEMBERS THEN VOTE FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THAT COUNCIL TAKES NO POSITION ON SEEK WOULD GENERALLY OR THE MERIT TO THE PARTICULAR PROJECTS. THAT WOULD BE PROPOSED FOR COVERAGE OUR SOLE CONCERN IS THE ADVERSE COURT IMPACTS THAT BILLS LIKE THIS HAVE. BOTH IN TERMS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE COURTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ON THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON LITIGANTS. MOVED TO THE BACK OF THE LINE WHEN YOU HAVE THIS ALTAR XCELERATED CALENDAR PREFERENCE. IS THIS COMMITTEES ANALYSIS POINTS OUT SECRET CASES ARE ALREADY ENTITLED THE CALENDAR PREFERENCE AT THE TRIAL AND APPELLATE LEVEL. THERE SPECIALLY TRAINED JUDGE REQUIREMENTS AND COUNTIES OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE. THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY ALTER CALENDAR PREFERENCE FOR THE SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF CASES. AT WORK TO UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR COURT SYSTEM IS A FAIR ARBITER. OF DISPUTES BECAUSE IT HAS THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF PUSHING ALL OF THE CASES ON THE COURT'S DOCKET TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. EVEN CASES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIZED. A COUPLE OF QUICK EXAMPLES. AND A HOUSING DISCRIMINATION OR AN EIGHTY A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ALLEGING DISCRIMINATION. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AMONG OTHERS THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS THOSE WOULD MOVE TO THE BACK OF THE LINE -- HOMEOWNER BILL RIGHT SECTION INSURANCE BAD FAITH CASES INVOLVING THE RECENT DEVASTATING FIRES OR THE MUD SLIDES IN YOUR DISTRICT MADAM CHAIR THOSE ALL WOULD MOVE TO THE BACK OF THE LINE -- THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT CASES WOULD ALL TAKE LONGER TO THE SIDE. ANOTHER POINT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO STRESS TO YOU TODAY. IS THAT THE JUDICIAL CONSTRUCT UPON WHICH THIS BILL AND IT'S SIMILAR BILLS ARE BASED ON WITH FLOOD FROM ITS INCEPTION AND IT SHOULD NOT BE REPLICATED EXPANDED. BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A FALSE PREMISE. THE UNDERLYING PREMISE FOR ALL OF THESE BILLS IS THE CERTAINTY THE ALLEGED CERTAINTY IN THE AUTHOR JUST MENTIONED THAT CERTAINTY. TO TO SUPPORT. PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD THAT FINANCING ISN'T POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE CERTAINTY THAT WOULD COME WITH THIS ULTRA TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY. CALENDAR PREFERENCE IN THE REAL WORLD THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST THE TWO CASES THAT BEEN LITIGATED UNDER AB. NINE HUNDRED THE WARRIORS LITIGATION AND EIGHTY ONE FIFTY SENSIBLE OF OUR PROJECT. IN LA BOTH HAD BOTH SEQUEL LITIGATION AND NON SEQUEL LITIGATION SO YOU HAVE THIS PERVERSE SITUATION WHERE THE SEQUEL LITIGATION. MOVES VERY QUICKLY BUT THE NON TAKE A PORTION MOVES UNDER OUR NORMAL TIME LINE SO IT WE JUST A BIT THAT THE CERTAINTY THAT SUPPOSEDLY COMES WITH THIS GAME. DOESN'T EXIST -- IN PRACTICE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT -- THE AUTHORS WILLING TO TAKE OUT THE LIMITS ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF -- BUT FOR ALL THE REASONS I JUST MENTIONED THE COUNCIL RESPECTFULLY AS OPPOSED TO NASRI OR KNOW ABOUT THANKYOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE AND ALSO WAS THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA -- IT IS OUR VIEW THAT WHILE THE BILL'S PROPONENTS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SEE QUALITY BECAUSE PROBLEMS ARE INTACT SUCH AS THE PUBLIC IT -- PARTICIPATION PROCESS AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS -- SEEK WAS NOT FULLY INTACT IN THAT. JUDICIARY VIEWS BECAUSE ONLY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM AND WHEN YOU SEE WE CAN ENFORCE A MECHANISM YOUR WEAKENING SEQUEL ITSELF -- EXPEDITIOUS REVIEW IN GENERAL IS ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY BASED ON THE PREMISE OF PRIORITIZING BENEFITS FOR DEVELOPERS OVER PLAINTIFFS OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY HURT BE HEARD. AND DEVELOP THEIR CASE APPROPRIATELY EVEN SO WHEN LEGISLATURE'S GIFTED THESE DEVELOPERS WITH THIS BENEFIT AS PUT CONDITIONS ON THE PROJECT. HOWEVER BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE LEADING GREEN BUILDING CODES IN THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY DEVELOPERS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED BY LAW TO HAVE SOME HIGH LEVEL ENVIRONMENTALLY ROBUST DEVELOPMENT AND SHOULD BE DOING SO. THERE IS AN AND THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS. A MORE OVER BECAUSE HE WAS ONLY ENFORCE A MECHANISM AS I SAID IS THE JUDICIAL PROCESS THAT RESULTS FROM INITIATING LITIGATION. SB SIX TWENTY ONES INTERFERENCE WITH THESE PROCESSES WILL HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT FOR THE PUBLIC IN YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THEIR SECRET PROCESS PROVIDE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW ABOUT BRITISH TO PAY IN THE PROCESS OF IN A PROCESS OF MEDICAID. MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND LITIGATION IT HAS BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THIS PROCESS IS THE ONLY ABILITY FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN LOW INCOME AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES. TO HAVE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THEY BREED IN THE WATER THEY DRINK IT'S CLEAN IS NOT HARMED BY PROPOSED PROJECT. BY PROVIDING EXPEDITED EXPEDITED DISTRIBUTED FOR DEVELOPERS YOU'RE TELLING YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT YOU'RE WE CAN YOUR OAK OF OPENING YOUR OPEN TO WE CAN SEE BECAUSE IN FOR SOME MECHANISMS. AND THEREBY. AND WE CAN AND THEY'RE JUST A RIGHTS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WEAR SUITS LITIGATION WHILE WORKING ONE OR TWO JOBS -- EXPOSURES REVIEW ACTUALLY CHECKED TIPS THE SCALES IN FAVOR FOR DEFENDANTS IN THE LAWSUIT. BY WORKING ON THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW DOCUMENT AND HAVE THE UPPER HAND BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL THE TIME RESOURCES AND INFORMATION THAT WENT INTO THE DOCUMENT. OF DEFENDANTS WILL BE READY TO LITIGATE WELL BEFORE THE PUBLIC IN YOUR CONSTITUENTS EVER I'VE SEEN A DRAFT MUCH LESS HAD TIME TO REVIEW AND PREPARE THE CASE. THE REST TIMELINE WILL LEAD TO COMMUNITY SCRAMBLING TO PUT TOGETHER RESOURCES SUCH AS INFORMATION AS WELL AS FINANCES ALL IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY LIVE WOULD NOT BE DEGRADED THANK YOU.

FOR OUR OUR COMMITTEE TO WAY I THINK ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE WE HAVE -- PUT IN PLACE PRETTY DRAMATICALLY PRO ENVIRONMENT STANDARDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY -- COMMITTEE THE IDEA THAT EVERYTHING THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE TO BE LEED CERTIFIED GOLD. IS A VERY HIGH STANDARD AND THE FACT YOU'VE GOT A GOVERNOR NOW TALKING ABOUT -- YEAH I I THINK YOU IF IF IF IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A PUSH FROM THE TOP I ON YOU KNOW TO TO TO TO REQUIRE FLEXIBILITY -- WITH THE RIGHT TO SEE WHAT SO AS TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- YOU KNOW IF WE CAN WALK OUT OF THIS WITH LEAD GOLD HOUSING UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT IS A HUGE PLUS. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT I AM NOW. WITH THE WITH THE ONLY THING THAT I WANTED TO LIKE DIG BEGIN ON HERE AND IT'S THE ISSUE THAT THIS THE CHAIR BRING UP. IS THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF NOT INCENTIVIZING CONSTRUCTION IN. HIGH RISK FIRESTONE'S RIGHT THE IDEA BEING THAT WE HAVE JUST GONE THROUGH TWO OF THE TOUGHEST YEARS. IN MODERN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AND WE KNOW FOLKS WANT TO BUILD AND BUILD AND BUILD IN A DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE FOREST. AND I JUST WOULDN'T WANT TO YOU KNOW I I WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE US IN THE NAME OF A PRO ENVIRONMENT. AS YOU KNOW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. PROJECT -- EXACERBATE OUR FIRE IS PROBLEMS I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVEN'T PERSONALLY BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE MAN'S I I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. BUT ON YOU KNOW BUT AT BUT AT THE VERY IT'S I I I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO YOU TO ACCEPT THEM AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN. BUT I I I DO I WANT TO ASK YOU. WHETHER I AND AN ENEMY JUST PARTS APART A LITTLE BIT LIKE. WHAT YOU SEE IS AS YOU KNOW WHAT WHETHER YOU'RE WILLING TO I DO YOU WANT THIS BILL. DO YOU SHARE MIGHT MIGHT MY DESIRE NOT TO INCENTIVIZE -- CONSTRUCTION THIS BILL IN HIGH RISK FIRES ON THE CHAIR PLEASE YEAH. SO I CERTAINLY SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THAT THAT ISSUE SENATOR ALLEN -- AND WHAT I DON'T KNOW -- IS YOU KNOW I I DON'T HAVE A MAP OF ALL THE HIGH RISK FIRE ZONES IN THE STATE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COVERS TODAY. DOES IT COVER SANTA ROSA. THAT MEANS SANTA ROSA COULD REBUILD IF IT MEETS THE DEFINITION OF THE BILL AND KEEP IN MIND THE DEFINITION IS. MAJOR TRANSIT. UNDER TWO HUNDRED UNITS LEAD GOLD APPROVED BY THE THAT COMMUNITY I MEAN YOU GO TO ALL THAT CREW CHOIR MINSITER IN THIS BILL. AND IS THAT GONNA STOP SANTA ROSE IS THAT CONSIDERED A HIGH RISK FIRES AND I HAVE NO IDEA I I HAVE NO IDEA NOW. DO I WANT TO STOP THE INCENTIVIZING. CONSTRUCTION IN PARADISE YES THAT'S AN EASY ONE OKAY. THAT'S AN EASY. ONE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD NEED THE DEFINITIONS OF THE BILL IN THE BILL ANYWAY BUT NEVERTHELESS I THINK PHILOSOPHICALLY. WE'RE IN THE SAME PLACE ECEPT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT THAT STANDARD APPLIES AND I DON'T KNOW. HOW IT MIGHT CHANGE AS WE WE DEFINE WHAT OUR STATE LOOKS LIKE UNDER? CLIMATE CHANGE SO THAT'S NOT A DIFFERENCE PHILOSOPHICALLY BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALIGNED ON THAT I JUST DON'T. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW I JUST NEED TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS THAT I'M SURE WE CAN FIND ACCOMMODATION BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS AS I HEAR IT RIGHT NOW IN. YOUR STUDENTS THIS NOT QUESTION WHETHER THEY CAN DEVELOP OR NOT IT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY SHOULD GET THIS SPECIAL. EXTRAORDINARY STREAMLINING. WHICH AS I SAY I YOU KNOW I'M OPEN TO YOU IF THERE'S A REAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH IT. ON SO I GUESS I I I WANT -- TO YOU KNOW HAVE OPPORTUNITY. TO TO TO JUST GET A BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU WANT TO COMMIT TO AYE -- BEFORE CASTING A VOTE ON THIS. I AM SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN DURING THIS PARTICULAR RIGHT NOW BUT YOU KNOW OF THIS BUT HEARING A PRIZE GOING UNTIL EIGHT OR NINE TONIGHT. SO WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME -- TO TO JUST GET A BETTER SENSE OF OF WHERE YOUR SO WITH THAT WITH THAT INSPIRING NOTE -- THANK YOU -- SENATOR BORCHERS WITH THAT INSPIRING OBSERVATION PLEASE FEEL FREE. TO ASK YOUR QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR WOMAN FOR ORDERING PIZZA AND APPARENTLY WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR SOME TIME TO ACT -- BUT THERE WE GO THERE WE GO -- I WANTED -- TO TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON TAKING A BITE I AT WAYS TO IMPROVE -- THIS PROCESS. MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON WHAT'S BEEN REPRESENTED IN THERE IN THE MATERIAL THAT I'VE READ IS. YOU DON'T CHANGE SEEK WHAT. YOU ARE TRYING TO EXPEDITE THE JUDICIAL PROCESS ON ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED IN THIS STATE. AND SO I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS ARE. GOING TO TRY TO COMPLETELY ISSUES -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK UPON THEM WITH SEPARATION. IS THAT SEEK WAS NOT BEING UNDERMINED. AND I THINK TO WHAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS IS WHAT NINE MONTHS -- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY. THINGS CANNOT WRAP UP IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME -- GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'VE CREATED EXCEPTIONS FOR LARGE SPORT COMPLEXES AND OTHER -- MAJOR AMENITIES THAT WE CONSIDER A PUBLIC BENEFIT SO I I THINK THIS IS A SMART MOVE. IT'S NOT WITHOUT IT'S CONTROVERSY I THINK CENTER ALLEN BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE -- EXPEDITED -- APPROVAL FOR PROJECTS. IN -- IN HIGH RISK ZONES BUT I OF MY BELIEVE THAT SEQUEL WOULD REVEAL. THE HIGH RISK ZONE AND FRANKLY A DEVELOPER WILL PROBABLY NOT BE INCLINED ALREADY. TO INVEST IN A SUPER RISKY AREA ANYWAYS. BUT THAT'S THAT THAT MAY BE DEBATED DEBATABLE BUT I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS TODAY. THANK YOU THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT I'M SORRY SENATOR UMBERG -- I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING HERE FOR THE ENTIRE HEARING BUT BUT OF WITH RESPECT. TO THE THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONCERNS I'M SURE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED ABOUT. PRIVATIZING CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STRAIN UPON THE COURTS AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE I THINK THOSE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS I THINK THOSE ARE ALL. ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO CONTEND WITH -- SHOULD THIS BILL PASS I EXPECTED IT WILL -- WILL THEN. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES THAT BY. CREATING ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE COURTS WE HAVE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF COURTS FOR THE COURTS WILL DEAL WITH THIS BECAUSE THE POINT. WITH RESPECT TO OTHER CONTROVERSIES BEING PUSHED FARTHER BACK IS A LEGITIMATE POINT AND WE'RE ALREADY AT THE BREAKING POINT PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF CIVIL JUSTICE. AND SO IT'S IT'S A POINT FOR ALL OF US WE WE CAN'T SUPPORT THIS ABOUT ADDITIONALLY SUPPORTING -- ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE COURTS THANK YOU MEASURE IS TONIGHT OUR IDEA. I ONE OF JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE I DO AGREE. YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED A CASE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- MANY CASES -- ACTUALLY LANGUAGE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND EVEN A CASE THAT MOVES WITH SOME RELATIVE SPEED AS I'M SURE. THOSE WHO WHO HAVE EXPERT HAD EXPERIENCES LITIGATORS KNOW THAT. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS WITH THIS IT IT INCLUDES SUPERIOR COURT COURT OF APPEAL AND OF THE STATE SUPREME COURT ALL LEVELS WOULD HAVE TO BE CONCLUDED WITHIN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS THAT'S THAT'S UNIMAGINABLE ACTUALLY. BUT OF COURSE WE CANNOT DICTATE TO THE COURTS SO WE COULD JUST URGE THEM AND I THINK WHEN WE HAD OUR WE HAD OUR HEARING ON THIS AND THE JUDGE. OF WHO IS THE EXPERT ON SHE WAS SAID THAT. YOU KNOW LOTS OF THINGS INTERVENE THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. AND I THINK OF CONCERN IS A POLICY ISSUE FOR SOME OF US WHICH IS A CONCERN FOR ME IS THAT. WE ARE WE WILL THUS BE PRIORITIZING SECRET CHALLENGES OVER ALL OTHER CASES. CIVIL RIGHTS CONSUMER PROTECTION ELDER ABUSE -- UNITING FAMILIES AND AS MY HUSBAND THE NOW RETIRED CRIMINAL LAW OR THE CRIMINAL COURTS JUDGE POINTED OUT. CRIMINAL COURTS HAVE PRIORITY REGARDLESS BECAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE OF THE OF A TRIAL -- A QUICK AND SPEEDY TRIAL SO. WE ARE REALLY I THINK. PUTTING A MAJOR KNEE IN THE BACK OF OUR COURTS THAT I'M NOT SURE WE WON'T ALL COULDN'T ULTIMATELY END UP WITH THE WHOLE SYSTEM COLLAPSING MAYBE IT WON'T. BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE'RE BASICALLY SAYING COURTS WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS. AND OF COURSE TELLING THE COURTS -- WHEN THEY CAN RESOLVE THE CASES LIKE THE COURTS TELLING US WHEN THE SAID A BILL? I MEAN IT'S THERE IS AN INDEPENDENCE IN A OF SPLIT -- AGAIN -- CONSTITUTIONALLY -- AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY SO -- IT IT BECOMES A REAL QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE COURTS HAVE THE RESOURCES NOW. SO I REALLY ARE I MEAN I'M. I AM WEIGHING AND AND I JUST WEARING THE THE THE THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA TELL SENIORS WE'RE GONNA TELL PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING. IN A WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND THEY'VE GOT MILLER MISSILES THE LEE ALSO SAID THAT WHATEVER GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT IT IS. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A BACKSTEP BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HEAR THE SEQUEL CASES SO THAT IS A THAT IS A REAL CONCERN -- AND AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT AND THEN CENTER AKOWSKI HAS QUESTION. AT THAT THANK YOU CHAIR -- I'D BE HAPPY TO FIRST THAT THE THERE'S A BILL MOVING TO THE LEGISLATURE HOPEFULLY IT'S MOVING THAT THE LEGISLATURE BY SENATOR ROD. THAT WOULD ADD JUDGES AND WHEN THOSE. THOSE BILLS ARE PRESENTED TO US ABOUT IT THAT WORKLOAD DEMANDS IN THE COURT SYSTEM THAT WE SHOULD BE AND I THINK WE HAVE BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THOSE AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT WE'D BE RESPONSIVE TO CENTER RAS BILL -- TO ADD I THINK OF A FEW OF TWO OR THREE DOZEN JUDGES OKAY. SECOND THE ARGUMENT IS BEEN THAT THERE'S SO FEW CASES THAT SEE THE CHEN THE OBJECTION TO BILLS LIKE THIS IS THAT WILL HOLD ON SICK WAS NOT A PROBLEM. AND THERE AREN'T VERY MANY CASES AND NOW SOMEHOW IT'S CAN OVERWHELM THAT THE COURT SYSTEM. A THIRD WE PUT A SUNSET IN THIS BILL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WITH THAT REQUIREMENT FOR DATA TO BE ACCUMULATED THIS TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WERE CLEARLY IF IT. IS CREATING A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM ET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND IF WE NEED TO CHANGE IT AND WE SHOULD BE OPEN TO TO CHANGE IT OR REVERSING IT -- FOR THAT MATTER. AND FINALLY -- IN THE TESTIMONY BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OR THE THE OTHER WITNESS THEY MENTION A TO GET TO SEE CA CASE IS TAKING A LONG TIME MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. UNDER THE CURRENT PROVISIONS THAT WE HAVE FOR THE STREAMLINING WELL THOSE ARE MASSIVE PROJECTS. MASSIVE PROJECTS A STADIUM PROJECT -- THE THE EITHER IF IT'S A MIXED USE RUFFLED -- APARTMENT PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES MASSIVE. THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE US HAS LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT ON IT NO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED UNITS. OKAY SO HERE WE HAD TWO CASES THAT MAYBE HAVE EXCEEDED AND NO THERE IS FLEXIBILITY IN THE COURTS TO GO BEYOND THE TWO SEVENTY BUT YES N THOSE CASES BUT THOSE ARE REALLY APPLICABLE TO WHAT WE WOULD BE PROVIDING IN THIS LEGISLATION -- IF IF THERE EVEN ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT THE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH BUT WE LOOK AT I'D THE CASES THAT YOU EXPLAIN THOSE THOSE BOTHER ME TOO OKAY THAT THAT THOSE. I WANT THOSE CASES TO BE RESOLVED -- AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD REQUIRE OUR VIGILANCE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE A IN THE SITUATION -- THAT DID THAT YOU DESCRIBE EITHER SO WE HAVE TO AS LEGISLATORS AS THE FOLKS WHO ALLOCATE THE MONEY. THE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE FUNDING OUR COURTS -- ADEQUATELY THANK YOU CENTER Y. CASKEY. IS THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND I'M NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AGAIN TODAY IS. WHEN WE DID AB NINE HUNDRED AND I VOTED FOR A. B. NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND -- TWENTY TWELVE AND WE PUT ALL THE LEAD CERTIFIED IN THE LABOR PROVISIONS IN THERE WE KNOW NOW AFTER EIGHT YEARS THAT THERE'S ONLY BEEN. TWELVE PROJECTS THAT HAVE HAVE FOLLOW THIS UNDER -- ON PAGE TEN OF OUR ANALYSIS THEY TALK ABOUT THEM AND THEY POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO THAT HAVE -- GONE TO COURT. RIGHT SO SO WE'VE GOT A LIMITED GROUP I AM FURIOUS WITH THE GOVERNOR ABOUT. FIVE CREATING SOME JINGLE WISDOM ABOUT BILLIONAIRE'S STADIUM PROJECTS AND HOUSING AND WE NEED TO DO THAT THAT'S WHOEVER WROTE THAT FOR HIM. IT'S INSULTING TO ME BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR AT THIS COMMITTEE AND THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY COMMITTEE WOULDN'T. IT WITH GREAT DETAIL TO THE PARALLEL NINE HUNDRED AND GET THE SAME SORT OF AFFECT FOR THOSE TWO PROJECTS BUT WE KNOW AT BEST IT WAS ONLY FOURTEEN PROJECTS. YOU SEEM TO DISCOUNT THE COURT PROCESS WHEN IT'S ONLY TWO HUNDRED APARTMENTS BUT THIS CREATES. AND THE POSSIBILITY OF HUNDREDS OF LAWSUITS BEING BROUGHT UNDER SEEK BUT THAT HAVE TO BE ADJUDICATED IN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. BECAUSE SO ANYBODY IF YOU IF THE THERE'S TWO ARGUMENT GOING ON HERE THERE IS EITHER NOT A LOT OF SICK THE LAWSUITS WHICH THERE'S BEEN REPORTS IN FRONT OF US. BUT YOU'RE INVITING WITH SO MANY PROJECTS AT THIS IS GOING TO BE GOLD LEAF CERTIFIED IN TWO HUNDRED IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY UNDER PROJECTS. TO AND AND I ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE THE BILL HERE THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN FOR THIS EXPLAINS TO THE WILL BE DONE QUICKLY. BUT HOW DOES THE COURT MANAGE SO MANY DIFFERENT PROJECTS WHEN IT'S ONE SAY THE STADIUM PROJECT GOT GOT IT I GET PEOPLE. THANK YOU GOVERNOR FOR COOPER LITTLE SMART ALECK REMARK ABOUT THAT THAT YOU'VE GOT POTENTIAL FOR HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS BASED ON YOUR OWN. A NOW OR YOUR OWN DESIRE TO SEE THESE HOUSING PROJECTS BUILT HOW DO WE ANSWER THAT. WELL THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR BY MAY. YEAH -- SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE IT IT'S ALWAYS CHECK CHALLENGE TO TRY TO DENY SOMETHING THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET RIGHT AND SO WE ALL HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT WE THINK MIGHT HAPPEN OR MIGHT NOT HAPPEN AND THAT'S THAT'S A CHALLENGE I I THINK THAT THE AND I THINK WE'VE IS SOMEWHAT. BEEN TRAPPED BY THE RHETORIC THAT'S BEEN USED BY ALL SIDES ON THIS ISSUE -- BUT BUT LOOK AT I I AT WE WE HAVE. LET ME FOCUS ON WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I I THINK WE ALL CARE ABOUT WHICH IS OUR HOUSING CRISIS WE KNOW WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. RIGHT AND WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT OF THAT HOUSING CRISIS IS TO THAT TO BUILD MORE HOUSING BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND I DON'T THINK THAT -- CHALLENGES UNDER SYKORA ARE GONNA BE THAT THE THE CONSEQUENCE OF TRYING TO BUILD A PART OF INCENTIVIZE. THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH IS WHAT REALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE BILL MOREHOUSING I I JUST DON'T SEE THAT CONSEQUENCES OUT THE BILL HAS PROVISIONS TO TRY TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THAT AS I'VE MENTIONED. IT HAS A SON SAID IT HAS REQUIRED STUDY -- ANNA AND I THINK THAT -- AND I ADDED AND IT HAS I THINK OUR OWN OBLIGATION TO FUND THE COURTS. IF THE ISSUE IS THAT THAT THE COURTS GET CLOGGED UP WHICH I DON'T AGREE WITH IT'S IT'S IT IT'S SPECULATION. THAT ISN'T IT OUR OBLIGATION IF WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND WE WANT TO GET THESE CASES RESOLVED APPROPRIATELY IN THIS IS NOT TO PRE JUDGE WITH THEIR FAIR CHALLENGES ARE UNFAIR CHALLENGES. WELL THEN LET'S AT THAT'S OR A KEY ELEMENT TO RESOLVING OUR HOUSING CRISIS WILL THEN WE NEED TO GET OUT. AND WE NEED IS FOR OUR COURTS SO THAT WE CAN THEY CAN DO THEIR WORK IF THERE'S THESE HUNDREDS OF CASES THAT YOU SPECULATE WILL COULD OCCUR [inaudible] MADAM CHAIR. ON PAGE EIGHT THE STAFF REPORT WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT JOB. TALKS ABOUT THE CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS AGRICULTURAL HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING URBAN RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS URBAN -- RESIDENTIAL MIXED USE PROJECT HE ADDED THAT IT THAT IT THAT ARE THAT ARE EXEMPT HAVE CATEGORICALLY EXEMPTIONS THAT WILL NEVER GET INTO THE LEGAL PROCESS BUT YOUR BILL HAS CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. ONCE A LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED. DO NOT GET IT IF YOU'RE NOT IMPROVING ON DEEZER OR GIVING US MORE SPECIFICS YOUR THE THE BIG BIG BANANA HERE IS THAT YOU WANT TO SEVENTY DAYS. BUT THROUGH THE DREAMER BY. ARE YOU DONE WITH YOUR ARM ALL RIGHT YES CENTER. WELL LOOK -- THE THESE THESE CATEGORIES OF AN IN PLACE FOR A WHILE. AND I AND WHERE ARE WE IN TERMS OF OUR HOUSING. CRISIS IN OUR STATE SO I HAVE A CC OTHER AREAS IN WHICH WE CAN FIND IMPROVEMENTS TO INCENTIVIZE. MORE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION BEYOND WHICH THAT ARE PROVIDED HERE. IN TERMS OF IN. EXISTING EXEMPTIONS -- THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE SENATOR IDENTIFIES. SO I THINK THAT BEFORE YOU ASKED A QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ALLOW THIS IS HERE CLUB YES TO CHURCHILL'S RESPOND BRIEFLY -- YEAH I JUST WANNA RESPOND BRIEFLY TO THIS ARGUMENT OF THE EXEMPTIONS HAVEN'T BEEN THIRD ON BOOKS AND STUFF HOUSING CRISIS THAT'S BECAUSE IN THE STOCK ANALYSIS SAYS. THESE EXEMPTIONS HAVE BEEN UNDER UTILIZED ON THAT AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS BUT WE DO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A STUDY AS TO WHY THAT IS -- ADDITIONALLY -- THE SENATOR HAS ALL THE AUTHOR HAS SAID THAT THE BILL IS ABOUT A PROVIDING A SOLUTION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS HOWEVER THIS BILL ONLY ALLOWS -- 430% AFFORDABILITY FOR IN REGARDS TO THE PROJECT AFTER ALLOWING FOUR NINE AND 70% MARKET RATE HOUSING AND SO IF YOU WANT STOOD SO IF YOU WANT TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING PRICES PROBABLY SORT OF SOME OF THE EXEMPTIONS THAT ALREADY IN SEQUEL. AND WOULD NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS ON THEIR FOUGHT THEIR BY. COMPLETELY HOLISTICALLY JUST BY PASSING THAT UNITS HAVE NEED A TIMELINE -- BUT OR MAYBE EVEN JUST PROVIDING FOR A 100% FOR ABILITY WHICH IS ALREADY A SEQUEL EXEMPTION SOME THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE KOWSKI LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR I THINK I JUST IT'S JUST A POINT. AND PAGE FIVE AND SIX A STAFF REPORT OF THE TALK ABOUT THE HOME ON THE NIGHTS -- REPORTS HE Q. REPORT BACK IN A TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE UC BERKELEY A REPORT IN THE TELL US IN IT I TELL X. THEY SEE WHAT DRIVES WHETHER AND HOW ONE FIREMAN REVIEW OCCURS RESIDENTIAL PRIDE PROJECTS. IS LOCAL LAND USE LAWS AND WE KEEP. EMPHASIZING IT SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> STREAMLINING AND ITS LOCAL LAND USE LAWS AND COST SO WHAT THAT I HAVE MADE MY KEYS I CANNOT SUPPORT IT. I'M DONE THANK YOU -- SENATOR JONES. A CENTER GLAZER -- YET YOU. PROBABLY DIDN'T INTEND TO TAKE. SUCH A CONTROVERSIAL -- TASK ON WITH THIS BUT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU DID AS HE DID HE KNEW HE WAS DOING. I BET HE WAS HOPING IT WOULDN'T BE AS CONTROVERSIAL BUT YEAH I I HAVE I'M HERE IN THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THEIR CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT YOU'VE DONE A A FAIRLY ADEQUATE JOB OF ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS I THINK YOU'VE POINTED OUT -- SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE BILL ADDRESSES THOSE CONCERNS -- YOU KNOW. I COME FROM A CITY ON THE CITY COUNCIL THAT 80% OF THE HOUSING STOCK IS SINGLE FAMILY HOMES -- WITH A SMATTERING OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS -- FIVE YEARS AGO -- THE CITY -- ONLY HAD A FEW THREE STOREY CONDO PROJECTS AND NO. THREE STORY APARTMENT PROJECT. AND THAT'S CITY COUNCIL HAS DECIDED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN. TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT'S HAPPENING NOT ONLY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUT ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN WE HEAR FROM A DEVELOPERS AND INVESTORS ARE IT ARE THE SEQUEL DELAYS AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM ARE LEGITIMATE AND AND BUT UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THEM AREN'T. AND SO -- YOU KNOW MY CITY HAS UP ZONED SEVERAL HUNDRED ACRES OF OF THE OF REMAIN LAST PIECES OF LAND. IN THE CITY THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED. WE'VE UP ZONED -- SOME INFILL PROJECTS TO ALLOW FOR REDEVELOPMENT IN IN SOME AREAS. AND I KNOW THAT -- THIS BILL IS GOING TO CREATE RELIEF -- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S GONNA CREATE -- CONFIDENCE OF FOR THE DEVELOPERS AND INVESTORS GOING FORWARD -- THAT THEIR PROJECTS -- YOU KNOW WON'T LANGUAGE AND SO I APPRECIATE -- THE CREATIVE HERE APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COLLEAGUES OF SHARED SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS I'VE -- I THINK THE YOUR YOUR COMPOSITE WAY TO DO THAT AND SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY [inaudible] SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OF I DO APPRECIATE THE SHARED OBJECTIVES -- I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING TODAY I DID HAVE A QUESTION ON I'M. ONE OF THE HURDLES FOR ME. IS THE CONCERN OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. WHEN WE PRESCRIBE A SET NUMBER OF DAYS THAT WOULD BE UNIFORM IN EVERY COURT SYSTEM AROUND CALIFORNIA? I REPRESENTS A PREDOMINANTLY RURAL AREAS SMALL COURT. SYSTEM MUCH SMALLER NUMBER OF JUDGES IN COURT ROOMS. THEN IN LARGE URBAN AREAS -- SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND LOS ANGELES -- THE BILL DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE THE DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON DIFFERENT SIZE COURT SYSTEMS DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. THROUGH THE TO THE CHAIR THAT. PLEASE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT I I SHARE THE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU RAISE SENATOR THAT WE DO HAVE TO ADEQUATELY FUND OUR COURTS AND THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE THE DIFFERENCES IN COUNTIES AND WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY. TO GET THROUGH THAT -- BUT IF WE IDENTIFY HOUSING IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT TOGETHER. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IN THROUGH THE CHAIR COULD I ALSO ASK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL LEASE. UNDER THE SAME QUESTION. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT -- THE THE TIMELINE ORIGINALLY WAS A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DAYS IN THE COURT OF APPEAL PROPOSING TO SKIP THE TRIAL COURT STEP THAT WAS FOUND IN CONSTITUTIONAL. IN LITIGATION IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND SO THEN WE THEN IN THE SB SEVEN FORTY THREE THAT THEM PRO TEM STEINBERG DID. THEM IT. HAD PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO THE KINGS ARENA AND THEN HAD TO HAVE THE QUOTE FIX. AND SO THE THE THE MAGIC TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS CAME FROM THAT BILL WE THINK IT WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY FOR THE LITIGATION THAT WAS BEING ANTICIPATED. THERE -- AND AND THE COURTS HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN THE TWO AB NINE HUNDRED CASES WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BOTH FROM VERY LARGE COUNTIES. SAN FRANCISCO AND LA -- AND I'D I DO THINK IN IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE POINTS AUTOMATE EARLIER. THAN. FOR THOSE CASE THAT WE CAN ALL DEBATE ABOUT HOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CASES GET FIT UNDER SEQUEL. BUT IF A PROJECT IS A CONTENTIOUS PROJECT IF THEY'RE CITING ISSUES AND NEVER VARIETY OF KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED LOCALLY. IT WILL BE HEAVILY LITIGATED -- IT WOULD BE MALPRACTICE NOT TO THINK OF EVERY POSSIBLE CAUSE OF ACTION TO BRING LIKE THE TWO EXAMPLES I GAVE YOU SO REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THOSE PARTICULAR PROJECTS THE REALITY. ON THE GROUND IS THAT NGUYEN COMMUNITY BY AND HAS NOT BEEN -- ACHIEVED. AND THERE ARE -- DETERMINED OPPONENTS THEY WILL USE EVERY CAUSE OF ACTION BOTH SICK BUT AND ON AND I AGAIN RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THE CERTAINTY THAT SUPPOSEDLY COMES FROM THE SCHEME -- DOESN'T EXIST WE DO APPRECIATE-- ALL OF THE EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST IN TRYING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS AN ADDITIONAL SUPPORT BUT I WOULD BE HERE EVEN IF WE HAD THAT. MAKING THE EXACT SAME POINTS BECAUSE LITERALLY RESPECTFULLY YOU'RE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. YOU ARE SAYING THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN CATEGORY OF CASE LIKE THE CHAIR MENTIONED THAT MOVES TO THE ABSOLUTE FRONT OF THE LINE AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERY OTHER CIVIL IT AGAIN ON THE DOCKET THIS IS JUST FUNDAMENTALLY. AT ODDS WITH OUR COURT SYSTEM SUPPOSED TO OPERATE LADY JUSTICE WITH THE BLINDFOLD RIGHT YOU DON'T PICK UP THE BLIND FULL. TO PICK THE WINNERS AND LOSERS THANK YOU NINE ONLINE MONEY CONCERNS WITH THOSE OF THE CHAIR EARLIER IN THIS AREA. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE VICTIMS OF HORRIFIC. ABUSE NEGLECT CETERA -- IN SOME -- SHORT TERM MERSON TERMS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY AND TO PUSH THEM TO THE BACK ONLINE WOULD BE A SOCIAL INJUSTICE AS WELL. BUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU -- AS SENATOR -- PORCHES FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ALLEN AND IT LOOKS LIKE CENTER OMER WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK ARTS. CENTER FOR JUST ALLEN IN THE NUMBER. I THINK WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS. WE HEAR ARGUMENTS DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT. THAT TALK ABOUT -- SEE COULD NOT BEING AN IMPEDIMENT TO DEVELOPMENT. DODD AND WE HAVE A REPORT FROM BERKELEY BE A URBAN ECONOMICS. I WE HAD A HEARING HERE. AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED THAT THE REPORT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT THAT SEQUEL REPRESENTS. A MAJOR BARRIER TO DEVELOPMENT. TO THE CONTRARY THE REPORT FOUND THAT ONLY ZERO POINT 7% OF ALL SECRET PROJECTS UNDERGOING ENVIRONMENTAL. REVIEW WERE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION. SO I'M TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY DO WE HAVE IT. IT'S EITHER GOING TO CLOG THE SYSTEM. IN BE SO FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. BUT HAVE TO ADMIT THAT SEEK WHAT IS -- AN UNDERLYING SOURCE OF LITIGATION THAT CREATES PROBLEMS IN THE HOUSING MARKET. OR THERE'S NONE OF LITIGATION -- DERIVED FROM CIBOLA THAT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE IT'S ZERO POINT 7% I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY I DON'T KNOW WHO'S RIGHT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU MY EXPERIENCE GOING BACK TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. IS THAT SYKORA. I IN ITS PROCESS IN THOSE THAT USE IT TO CHALLENGE A PROJECT ROUTINELY REACH AN ACCOMMODATION AND UNDERSTANDING AT SOME POINT IN THE PROCESS. WHERE BY THE LITIGATION GOES AWAY [inaudible] HAPPENS. ALL THE TIME. IN SO IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT MOST LITIGATION GOES AWAY. THAT IS DERIVED UNDERSEA QUIRK. AND THAT ZERO POINT 7% IS ACCURATE LESSON 1%. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE WE WON'T BE CLOGGING THE JUDICIARY. AND THAT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS OR THREE YEARS IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY. SO I GUESS MY MY POINT IS WE CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS FOLKS. WELL I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS SO YOU POINT OUT IS THAT NOW YOU ARE OPENING UP. ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE KINDS OF I MEAN YOU'RE EXPANDING THE POTENTIAL SCOPE. TO INCLUDE DAD IN OF COURSE. THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT AS WELL IF IF SEEK WAS WORKING THEN WHY BOTHER TO MAKE THESE. AMENDMENTS I WILL I WILL TELL YOU THOUGH I COULD BE WRONG BUT MY UNDERSTANDING MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH OUR INABILITY. TO BUILD LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING A PARTICULAR APARTMENT BUILDINGS HAPPENED BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN WE TOOK AWAY THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION. OPPORTUNITIES I IN OUR FEDERAL TAX LAW. SO IF WE WANT TO GET MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SEEMS TO ME MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE -- IN IF WE COULD RENEW THAT. XCELERATED DEPRECIATION SO FOR DEVELOPERS IT WOULD PENCIL OUT FOR THEM TO BUILD MORE APARTMENTS. THAT MIGHT BE THE ANSWER MAYBE WE'RE JUST IN A WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE HERE POTENTIALLY. IF THAT WAS IN FACT THE PROBLEM THEN AND AND DOES TAX EXPERTS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE AND DEVELOPERS WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I YOU GIVE ME THAT ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AGAIN. AND IT PAY IT PENCILS OUT TO BUILD I WILL BUILD SEE COULD BE DARNED AND EVERYTHING ELSE BE DARNED THAT'S WHERE I MAKE MY MONEY SO. I JUST WONDER. YOU KNOW WE'RE BANG IN THIS. THIS ISSUE AND I COULD ARGUE WITH EVERY DIFFERENT WHICH WAY -- I JUST THINK THAT. THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY EVEN BOTHER IF NONE OF THESE CASES AND UP IN SEEK WERE PROCEEDING SO I'M NOT SURE. WHERE WE'RE ALL GOING WITH THIS AND BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND IN POINT OF VIEW? IT JUST FINISH MY COMMENTS FROM THE FOR IT DOESN'T MATTER. IN IT'S A MATTER OF FAIRNESS. IF WE ARE DISCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT -- WE ARE REDUCING THE STOCK. AND THERE LIES THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND RATIO THAT IS PROBLEMATIC THAT IS INCREASING THE PRICES BECAUSE OF DEMAND. SO THE ISSUE SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY ONLY BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT SHOULD BE HOUSING THAT INCREASES THE STOCK IN DRIVES A MORE MODEST APPRECIATION VALUE. THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE AFFORDABILITY. I THINK A LOT OF ECONOMISTS WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. UNDER STEAK YOU SENATOR ALLEN. THE BY THE DOCKET -- I I I HEAR SO MANY CONFLICTING THINGS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN LARGER COURTS THERE IS A A JUDGE SHE WAS DESIGNATED TO TAKE THE SECRET CASES. SO I'M TO SOME EXTENT DOES NOT MITIGATE -- ND GIVE IT TO THE SOUTH TO BOTH OF PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS DOES NOT MITIGATE. THE ISSUE A BET. IF YOU LIKE TO ANSWER. I'M COUNTY SERVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE POPULATION HAVE TO HAVE ONE OR MORE SPECIALLY TRAINED JUDGES TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE BANQUET CASES. AND THEY DO AND THEY ALREADY HAVE CALENDAR PREFERENCE AT THE TRIAL APPELLATE LEVEL IT'S THE ARBITRARY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY REQUIREMENT THAT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL. RESOURCES BOTH IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH TIME THAT JUDGES SPENDING ON THAT PARTICULAR CASE THE STAFF SUPPORT THE ATTORNEYS AND SO FORTH AND IT MEANS THAT EVERY OTHER CASE ON THOSE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; --&lt;/c&gt;</u> JUDGES DOCKETS TAKE LONGER TO DECIDE WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION -- WOULD WOULD YOU FEEL BETTER AND I'M NOT NEGOTIATING FOR THE DICE AT ALL I'M JUST DURING OUT A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS GET UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PERSPECTIVE. WOULD YOU FEEL BETTER IF IT WERE THREE SIXTY FIVE DAYS OR IS IT EASY. I MEAN I I KNOW YOU SO. IT IS THE ISSUE THE LENGTH OF TIME OR IS IT THE ISSUE OF ANY KIND OF PRIORITIZATION. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS A LONG HISTORY OF OPPOSITION THE CALENDAR PREFERENCES FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT I ALLUDED TO EARLIER. IT IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC WITH THE TIME LINE THAT HAS BEEN CHOSEN IN THESE INDIVIDUAL CASES BUT WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME OBJECTIONS IF YOU ADDED ANOTHER HUNDRED DAYS FRANKLY BECAUSE EVERY CASE IS DIFFERENT. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RECORD OF THE LAW THAT HAS TO BE APPLIED IN THAT INDIVIDUAL CASE. THE COURTS MOVE QUITE QUICKLY IN IN IN THE LAST HEARING THAT WE HAD ON THIS I I DID TESTIFY THERE ARE THINGS THAT COULD SPEED UP. THE QUALIFICATION. THE IGGEST AREA OF DELAY IN SEQUOIA IS THE FIGHTS OVER THE PREPARATION AND CERTIFICATION RECORD. AND THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT THAT'S MAYBE FOR DIFFERENT HEARING TODAY BUT WE HAVE OFFERED PROACTIVE IDEAS ABOUT WAYS TO ACTUALLY STREAMLINED IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. TO MOVE THESE CASES ALONG BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT'S NOT AND BY THE WAY IF YOU TAKE IT. IF THE IF THE BILL GETS ON THE AUTHOR HAS TROUBLE MOVING FORWARD I MEAN THAT MIGHT BE A CONVERSATION YOU OUGHT TO HAVE TOGETHER. SO THE SO BUT WHAT WILL HAVE YOU CLOSED BUT I WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS I COULD GIVE YOU SINCE THE QUESTION THAT I WAS. A YOU COULD DO THIS PERSPECTIVE ON THAT OKAY BUT LET HIM DO IT NEWS CLOSE -- THE THE UNLESS SENATOR UMBERG DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT TO KNOW YOU'RE OKAY BYE TO WOULD YOU INCLUDE THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO. IS -- WILL HAVE YOU CLOSE WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION BUT I'D LIKE TO HOLD OFF ON THE ON A VOTE. SO THAT SENATOR ALLEN CAN DISCUSS WITH YOU THAT OTHER ISSUE -- AND THEN WE WILL ONCE YOU'VE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WE WILL THEN TAKE A VOTE. SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS ANY OTHER ISSUE. THE FLOOR IS YOURS FOR YOUR CLOTHES ALL RIGHT THERE THANK YOU JERRY JACKSON AND MEMBERS FOR THE THOROUGH DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE TODAY AND I SAID SHE WAS SUCH A LONG DOCKET THAT YOU HAVE AND AND THE LONG DAVE ALREADY HAD SO. LET ME TRYTO SUMMARIZE FIRST BY ADDRESSING SENATOR ALLEN'S QUESTION THAT I THINK THE ANSWER IS. YES THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF MEDICATION BASED ON THAT REQUIREMENT IN TERMS OF THE EXPERTISE OF THE JUDGES IN THE LARGER POPULATION AREAS THEY HAVE. EXPERTISE THAT CAN HELP APPLIED. TO THEMSELVES OF THOSE CASES BUT THE ESSENCE OF IT IS THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. AND IT'S WITH THE CHAIR REALLY RAISED EARLIER IS THAT. A HER SUGGESTION ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW AS SOMEHOW MAYBE A BETTER RESOLUTION ANOTHER RESOLUTION TO IT -- IS THAT -- WE NEED TO FIND -- IT AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR A PRIVATE DEVELOPER WHO'S PUTTING THEIR MONEY INTO THE PROJECT THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN CALCULATION OF RISK REWARD. AND WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY GET SUBSIDIES OR OTHER INCENTIVES OUT THERE THAT GOES INTO THAT CALCULATION OR THE WORRY THAT IF THE PROJECTS CHALLENGED BY A NEIGHBOR WHO JUST DOESN'T LIKE IT. OR SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SOME OTHER SELF INTEREST THAT IT GETS LOCKED UP IN A COURT SYSTEM THAT HAS NO END TO IT. AND THAT CARRYING COSTS X. X. CETERA GOES INTO THEIR RISK CALCULATION IS SAYS IT'S NOT WORTH DOING. IT'S JUST NOT WORTH TAKING THE CHANCE AND PUTTING OUR CAPITAL -- BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY SEE HOW WE CAN GET THROUGH IT -- SO THERE'S LOTS OF CALCULATIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAKES WHEN THEY MAKE THESE CHOICES. THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS IN A NARROW WAY ONE OF THE MEN WHICH I'VE HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT -- WHICH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A RESOLUTION OF A SEQUEL CASE WERE IT TO BE. CHALLENGED OKAY. AND AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL'S BEEN WRITTEN THIS WAY I'LL NOTE IN MY CLOTHES NOW THAT. THAT THROUGH THAT YOUR GOOD WORK IN YOUR COMMITTEE THAT WERE COMMITTED TO NOT ONLY LIMITING THE SIZE OF THE PROJECTS TO LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED UNITS. BUT SETTING THE HIGHER STERN VIA MENTAL STANDARDS MORE THAN EVEN REQUIRED UNDER THE THOROUGH SEQUEL PROCESS THAT GOES ON IN THE JUDGMENTS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAKE. ABOUT WHETHER PROJECTS EVEN WORTHY OF GOING FORWARD AND WHETHER THAT ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS EVEN WORTHY OF BEING APPROVED [inaudible] SO. ED AND ENDED THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THE COURT SYSTEM I AS I SAID EARLIER WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FUND OUR COURT SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CASES IN WHICH THE CHAIR AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED ARE RESOLVED. IT'S REALLY OUR PROBLEM AND WE WE HAVE THE POWER TO RESOLVE IT WE DO. IT THAT'S THE HEART OF OF OF FUNCTIONING COURT SYSTEM OF FAIR COURT SYSTEM.

JONES I AM MONNING [inaudible] STERN [inaudible] I'M BURKE. NUMBER OF IOWA KELSEY. WHAT HOUSE KENO? OR TWO WE HAVE ALL THE MEMBERS HERE. ALL RIGHT OF THE BILL PASSES OF FIVE TWO ONE THANK YOU -- CENTER GLAZER. AND NOW A VERY PATIENT SENATORS SKINNER WHO'S HAD A LONG DAY ON OUR OWN. YOU HAVE TO MEASURES UP. YEAH THANK YOU. WE'LL START OF WITH A FILE ITEM. THREE SB. EIGHTEEN I WILL WAGER SECONDED THE FOR THE ROOM TO QUIET DOWN SO YOU YOU CAN GET STARTED ALL RIGHT OKAY. AND THE AS WE START I'D LIKE TO CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WITHOUT AN INCOME CAP ON ELIGIBILITY. FOR THE LEGAL AID SERVICES AT THIS TIME IS THAT CORRECT YES THANK YOU AND WE WILL I'VE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORKING ON VERY GOOD A INCOME CAP ISSUE. THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED AND IF I COULD REMIND WITNESSES THAT THE GIVEN THE HOUR AND THE GENERAL RULES OF THIS COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO WITNESSES -- PER SIDE TWO MINUTES EACH AND THEN ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES TO GIVE THEIR IT KIND OF SHIN AND THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION AS IS APPROPRIATE SO. CENTER SKINNER IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROCEED THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB EIGHTEEN IS A PREVENTION MEASURE -- WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S SIRIUS HOUSING CRISIS. AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT HOUSING PRICES IS THE INCREASING HOMELESSNESS. NOW INTERESTINGLY THE DATA -- ARE HOMELESS POPULATION ROSE 16% BETWEEN THE YEARS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE ARE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES DO -- I'LL CALL THE CENSUS BUT INDEPENDENT THE CENSUS THEY COLLECT EVERY YEAR -- INFORMATION ABOUT WHO THEY'RE HOMELESS POPULATION IS AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THESE NEWLY HOMELESS ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE EMPLOYED. THEY'RE WORKING. THEY WERE RECENTLY HOUSED. AND THEY ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL AND THEY ARE NOT ADDICTED THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE JUST. FOR EXAMPLE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A WAY OF FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS UNEXPECTED EXPENSE AWAY FROM LOSING THEIR HOUSING BECAUSE THEY COULD THEN BE THERE GOT BEHIND IN THEIR RENTS. THEY COULD MEET PAYMENTS AND MANY OF THEM WERE NOT AFFECTED BUT THEY LEFT THEIR HOUSING TO AVOID EVICTION BECAUSE AN EVICTION ON YOUR RECORD BASICALLY CAN PREVENT YOU. FROM BEING ABLE TO RUN AGAIN. RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA OVER A QUARTER OF OUR RENTER'S. SPEND OVER HALF OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT INCREASES THE FUNDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WHICH THEY ALREADY HAVE AN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUND. AND SO IT INCREASES THAT FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED. AND IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE SOME LEGAL AID MONIES TO ASSIST. OUR PEOPLE TO IN EFFECT STAY IN THEIR HOUSING -- D. SIMILAR PROGRAM IN NEW YORK DECREASED. PEOPLE LOSING THEIR PLACES OF RESIDENCE BY A 14%. AND IN OAKLAND A PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED JOSH LAST OCTOBER HAS ALREADY ASSISTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FAMILIES. AND THE ORDER OF ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN IN THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE. AND ALL OF THOSE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN HOUSING SINCE THEIR ASSISTANCE SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND I'VE CARE AN ERICSSON FROM CATHOLIC CHARITIES. AND ALEXANDER HARDEN FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. VERY GOOD GOOD AND GOOD EVENING AND TO TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD. YES THANK YOU -- THANK YOU SO% MUCH FOR LETTING ME SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SB EIGHTEEN AND SENATOR SKINNER TOOK SOME OF MY POINT SO MAYBE IT'LL -- SPEEDED UP EVEN MORE BUT THE MAIN THING I WANTED TO SAY ABOUT PREVENTION IS THAT IT'S OF SMALL INTERVENTION THAT'S THE MOST HUMANE. AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE. ENDING HOMELESSNESS BEFORE IT STARTS MAKES THE MOST SENSE SO WE NEED WE NEED ALL OF OUR HOMELESSNESS INTERVENTIONS WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING WE NEED. HELP REYES RENTAL SUBSIDIES BUT WE DEFINITELY NEED MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDS TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOUSE -- WE HAVE. BEEN ABLE -- TO OBVIOUSLY WITH A SENATOR SKINNER SAID WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOUSEHOLDS. WHICH OF COURSE IS THREE THAT MEANS USUALLY THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD SIZE IS. THREE SO THAT'S LIKE OVER TWENTY ONE HUNDRED OR SO -- FAMILIES AND TO BUILD A HOUSING WITH THOSE SAME AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WE WOULD ONLY HOUSE A HUNDRED FIFTY FAMILIES SO IT'S JUST THE MOST REASONABLE AND EFFECTIVE. AND POSITIVE INTERVENTION THAT WE CAN DO -- HOW THE HOUSING COSTS BURDEN IS IS IS THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU SPEND -- SAY -- UP TO IT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THE AVERAGE FAMILY SPENDING 44% OF THEIR INCOME. TOWARDS RENT AND THEN -- IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IT'S UP WHERE IS YOUR CUSHION WHERE'S YOUR SAVINGS SOUL WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR JOB WHEN YOU CAN'T GO TO WORK? WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE TO DO WHERE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO GET THAT EXTRA MONEY SO WE REALLY HAVE FOUND THIS PROGRAM TO BE AN AMAZING? AMAZINGLY POSITIVE IMPACT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING TERM MEMBERS I'M ALEXANDER HER NAME WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- PLEASED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB. EIGHTEEN THIS BILL CONTAINS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT INTERVENTIONS FOR TENANTS AS WE SEEK TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS. THE BILL MAKES MAKES PERMANENT PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS LIVING IN FORECLOSED PROPERTIES WHICH WILL OTHERWISE SUNSET THIS YEAR AND WHICH PROTECT INNOCENT TENANTS FROM AN ARBITRARY AFFECTION AFTER FORECLOSURE WITHOUT AFFECTING INFECTIONS BASED ON TENANT FAULT. IN ADDITION THE BILL PROVIDES NEEDED FUNDING FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE RENTER EDUCATION AND LEGAL SERVICES FOR TENANTS AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT -- WE'VE HEARD ABOUT COST BURDEN AND I WON'T REPEAT THAT -- BUT WE MUST PREVENT MORE RENTERS FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS AS WE SEEK LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS TO HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND SUPPLY -- THE LEGAL SERVICES AVAILABLE UNDER THIS BILL RANGE FROM EARLY INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS NEGOTIATING WITH LANDLORDS TO ADDRESS A DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION OR A DISRUPTION IN INCOME -- TO EVICTION DEFENSE -- TO TO ADDRESS CASES THAT ARE ACTUALLY FILED -- IT'S ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 90% OF LANDLORDS BENEFIT FROM AN ATTORNEY IN THE ELECTION PROCESS IN COURT. AND APPROXIMATELY 90% OF TENANTS DO NOT AND ARE FORCED TO NAVIGATE THAT PROCESS ALONG -- SB EIGHTEEN BRINGS NEEDED RELIEF TO RENTERS -- INCREASES THEIR ABILITY TO AVOID EVICTIONS AND DISPLACEMENT INCREASES FURNACE AN EVICTION PROCESS -- AND PRESERVES IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS LIVING IN FORECLOSED PROPERTIES AND WE ARE TECH SUPPORT THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE NAME AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION VERY BRIEFLY YES NO TWEENER.

IF THE THIRD PRONG OF YOUR PROGRAM TO MENTAL ASSISTANCE AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE STAFF REPORT ON PAGE. SIX TALKS ABOUT THE SKIMPING THIS OF IT NOT. WHAT E. R. WITH IT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ANY FUSION OF MONEY TO A LEGAL AID PROGRAMS THAT WE WE FIND HERE IS THIS A DIFFERENT FIND WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT BECAUSE IT'S NOT? IN THE BILL NOW SO THE IN THE BILL WOULD -- OF COURSE DEPENDING ON AN APPROPRIATION INCREASE FUNDING TO AN EXISTING PROGRAM RUN BY THAT -- HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WHERE THERE IS WE ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S ESTABLISHED AN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUND. HOWEVER IT IS NOT ADEQUATE -- BUT HOW THE HOW EIGHT C. D. ADMINISTERS IT IS THEY DON'T ADMINISTER INDIVIDUAL. GRANTS TO INDIVIDUAL TENANTS BUT RATHER THEY GIVE GRANTS TO EITHER NON PROFITS COMMUNITY AGENCIES OR CITIES OR COUNTIES WHO THEN. WOULD HAVE PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE THIS RENTAL ASSISTANCE. IN THE BILL HAS A CAP OF BASED ON THESE AMENDMENTS ON HOW MANY MONTHS AND WHAT AMOUNT -- BUT BASICALLY WOOD HOW MUCH WOULD BE AVAILABLE IS DEPENDENT ON THE APPROPRIATIONS AND WHAT ARE APPROVAL OF THIS BILL IF IF YOU DO SO PROVE IT AND IT MOVES FORWARD WOULD. IT SHOW THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE'S INTENT TO INCREASE THAT FUNDING NOW WITH THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE THAT -- EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FIND. IN ITS GIVING GRANTS TO COMMUNITY AGENCIES IN CITIES AND SUCH. IS NOT RESTRICTED TO RENTAL ASSISTANCE ONLY AND ALLOWS FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE BUT WE WOULD HAVE THE OPTION WE IS THE LEGISLATURE. TO TO INCREASE THE EXISTING LEGAL ASSISTANCE FUND THAT WE HAVE OR TO ALLOW IT JUST TO STAY WITH A TWO CD AND HAVE THEM PROCEED AS THEY DO IN THEIR HOUSING EMERGENCY FUND. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL YOU BEAT ME TO THE COURTHOUSE ON THIS ONE BECAUSE WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION UP IN BERKELEY -- I THINK THAT WAS PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED YOU. THE KEY THING HERE IS THAT GIVING PEOPLE THAT LITTLE LIFELINE. SO THAT THEY CAN STAY IN THEIR HOMES WERE FIND THAT SENIORS IN PARTICULAR. WHO'VE NEVER BEEN HOMELESS WHO WERE NOT HOME. GOING TO BE HOMELESS BECAUSE A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE BUT CHAO'S CAN'T MAKE THAT PAYCHECK. FIND THEMSELVES IN THE STREET WHERE THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOME WITH THIS KIND OF A PROGRAM SO. WORKING IF YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WE'VE GOT A GHETTO SOME FINE TUNING ON THE BILL WITH THE LEGAL SERVICES ISSUE -- I AM DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT IT AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR SINCE YOU BEAT ME GREAT TO BOTH OF THE BILL. MOTION BY SENATOR MONNING WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I THINK THE STRONGEST CLOSES THAT. WE SPEND NOW ARE EITHER OUR CITIES OR COUNTIES WITH WITH EMERGENCY SERVICES CALTRANS CLEAN UP OTHER -- OTHER. THINGS WE ARE SPENDING THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL IF WE CAN SPEND 300-025-0002 PREVENT SOMEONE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IT IS A VERY WISE INVESTMENT IN WITHOUT I ASK FOR AYE VOTE. ALREADY IS THERE A MOTION -- I'M SORRY CENTER MORNING JUST MADE THE MOTION TO PASS S. AMENDMENT TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS. ALAN. ALLEN AYE CABALLERO [inaudible] JONES. JONES NO MONNING. MONEY AYE STERN [inaudible] NUMBER. NUMBER TO IOWA CASKEY Y. CASKEY I ALL RIGHT THAT HIS OF FIVE TWO ONE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN BUT THAT MEASURE WILL. HAVE SUCCEEDED AND SO WE WILL MOVE TO YOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- SENATOR SKINNER HAS ONE OTHER BILL IT'S FILE ITEM. SEVEN SB -- THREE TEN THANK YOU WHICH WHICH A SECOND SO THE PEOPLE CAN LEAVE AN THE NOISE IN THE HALLWAY IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE AND SIR. IN THIS HEARING ROOM. ALL RIGHT SIR SKINNER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANKS SO MUCH -- SO SB. THREE TEN IS WHAT I FEEL IS A VERY IMPORTANT JURY REFORM. CALIFORNIA LAW GUARANTEES. EACH OF US THE RIGHT TO A JURY OF OUR PEERS. BUT IN PRACTICE WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT HAVE SHRUNK THE JURY POOL. AND HAVE -- STOPPED OUR JURIES FROM BEING REPRESENTATIVE AND ONE OF THOSE LAWS IS THAT PEOPLE WITH A PRIOR FELONY CONVICTION ARE PERMANENTLY. ELIMINATED FROM BEING ABLE TO SERVE ON A JURY. NOW WHAT DOES THAT DO. IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. ABOUT ONE THIRD OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN WHO ARE RESIDING CALIFORNIA ARE NW PREVENTED FROM SERVING ON A JURY. AND YOU CAN GET A FELONY FROM SUCH THINGS. NOT TO TO MINIMIZE BUT GRAFFITI. OR DRUG OFFENSE. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FELONIES WHICH I THINK FOR MOST OF US. IF WE LOOK AT A PERSON WHO HAS SERVED THEIR TIME. AND IS FUNCTIONING IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS THRIVING IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHY WE WOULD? ELIMINATE THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE ON A JURY WE'VE RESTORED THEIR VOTING RIGHTS -- BUT YET WE ELIMINATE THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE ON A JURY. SO BASICALLY WHAT SB THREE TEN DOES IS REVERSE THAT AND ALLOW PEOPLE WITH WHO WERE OFF OF PROBATION AND HAVE. A FORMER FELONY CONVICTION TO SERVE ON A JURY IT ALSO EXPANDS THE LIST THAT A COURT USES TO BE ABLE TO SELECT JURORS BECAUSE IT PRIOR WAS VERY LIMITED -- IN. A FINAL THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT. WE WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST STATE TO DO THIS WHATSOEVER WERE BEHIND. COLORADO ILLINOIS MAINE OREGON FOR EXAMPLE OTHER STATES HAVE A ALLOW DO YOU ALLOW PEOPLE WITH FORMER FELONY CONVICTIONS TO SERVE AND WITHOUT I WOULD LIKE. MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- WE HAVE AMINAH ELSTER FROM LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN AN OSCAR -- BARBRO WHO SEE PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM SOLANO COUNTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WELCOME IN IF YOU WOULD EACH BE TWO MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY-NAME IS A MEAN ELSTER -- AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS OF CHILDREN AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT SB. THREE TEN I AM A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AND I HAVE NEVER SERVED ON A JURY AND HAVE ONLY PARTICIPATE IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS ONCE. IT WASN'T SO AFTER MY CONFINEMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION THAT I REALIZE THE RAMIFICATIONS MY PAST MISTAKES AND FELONY CONVICTIONS WOULD HAVE ON MY FUTURE AS A CITIZEN HERE IN THIS GREAT CRUNCHING. CUT GREAT GREAT COUNTRY. THE PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS I FACE TODAY SERVE AS A CONSTANT REMINDER OF THE PERSON I USED TO BE AND THE MISTAKESI MAY LONG AGO. I AM GAINFULLY EMPLOYED A STUDENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND CONTRIBUTE REGULARLY TO OUR ECONOMY JUST AS EVERY OTHER LAW ABIDING CITIZEN TODAY. AS A LEGAL STUDIES MAJOR I AM FURTHER REMINDED THAT ALTHOUGH CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS HAVE EMBRACED ME BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO SHUT ME OUT OF PROCESSES. THAT ARE FUNDED FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT IT MEANS TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A CITIZEN. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT JURY DIVERSITY INCREASES THE OVERALL QUALITY OF DELIBERATIONS. STUDIES ALSO SUGGEST THAT PROPERTIES A POTATO. BROAD PARTICIPATION EXTENDS THE EDUCATED REACH OF THE JURY POSSIBLY PROMOTING THE SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN THE RATE AT WHICH FORMER JURORS TAKE PART IN POLITICAL PROCESSES. DIVERSITY OF SERVICE ALSO LEGITIMIZES JURY VERDICTS ESPECIALLY FOR TRADITIONALLY MARGINALIZED CITIZENS. BY EXTENDING THE OLDER PRIOR FELONY CONVICTIONS FROM THE VENEER BELEN JURY EXCLUSION STATUES DEFEAT THESE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF WIDESPREAD PROTESTS PARTICIPATION IN THE JURY PROCESS. THIS IS GOOD IN EVERY PROCESS AND NOT ROOTED IN RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE AND BUILD A PRIOR FELONY CONVICTIONS POSE LITTLE HARM TO SERVING ON THE JURY. THE VALUE OF X. INCLUSION WILL FOSTER TRANSFORMATION FROM THE FACT THAT I AM AN ASSET AND NO LONGER LIABILITY. I'M A STRONG BELIEVER THAT JURISDICTION'S COULD VERY WELL BENEFIT FROM INCLUSION WHICH WOULD DEMONSTRATE ULTIMATE SHOW OF TRUST AND WELCOMING EXTENDED TO FOLKS RETURNING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. FOR THESE REASONS I ACTS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLAY. MY NAME'S OSCAR BARBARA I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND CHIEF DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER IN SOLANO COUNTY. ON CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IS THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA WITH PROXIMALLY FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS AND WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE WITNESSED. CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE JUSTICE SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATELY PROSECUTE IN OUR COURTS MEMBERS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC POPULATIONS OF OUR STATE. RELATIVE TO THEIR NUMBERS IN THE POPULATION. HOWEVER WHAT IS NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED -- DRESSED IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HERE. IS THAT WE ARE SELECT WHEN WE ARE SELECTING A JURY TO DECIDE THE FATEOF OUR CLIENTS ACCUSED OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. THE REVERSE OF THAT SITUATION EXISTS. THAT IS THERE IS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF CAUCASIAN RESIDENTS IN THE JURY POOLS RELATIVE TO THEIR NUMBERS IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE CASES ARE PROSECUTED. AND BECAUSE SIGNIFICAN UNDER REPRESENTATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANICS IN THOSE JURY POOLS. DESPITE DECADES OF THIS PHENOMENON BEING EXPOSED IN OUR TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS. THIS PHENOMENON REMAINS. TO TUESDAY THE SYSTEMATIC EXCLUSION OF MINORITY RESIDENTS. THAT RESULTS FROM OUR CURRENT JURY SELECTION PROCESS BY ONLY USING TWO LISTS. PART OF MOTOR VEHICLES IN VOTER REGISTRATION LISTS. THIRTY THREE OTHER STATES IN THIS COUNTRY USE ADDITIONAL LISTS IN ADDITION TO THOSE TWO LISTS. THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU ACKNOWLEDGES THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM OF JURY SELECTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR A CHANGE IN ORDER PROTECT THE UNDER REPRESENTATION. OF MINORITY RESIDENTS IN IS YOUR CORRECT THE UNDER REPRESENTATION. OF MINORITY RESIDENTS IN HISTORY POOLS. ESPECIALLY GIVEN ITS CONTINUED OVER REPRESENTATION OF THE MINORITY POPULATIONS OF THIS STATE AS CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS AT OUR COURT ROOMS. I CAN'T EXPRESS TO YOU HOW DISHEARTENING FRUSTRATING AND DEVASTATING IT IS TO TURN TO A CLIENT WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO PROTECT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. AND WHEN THAT PANEL WALKS IN THE COURT ROOM TURN AROUND AND SAY THERE ISN'T A SINGLE PERSON THAT IS THE SAME RACE AS YOU OR IF THEY CAN LOOKS LIKE YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU PLEASE STEP FOR DAMON AFFILIATION VERY CLEAR SHE HARM BOB OF THE CALIFORNIA PLAY MILLERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JESSICA CENTER ABOUT RECORDS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THE BEING ACROSS CITY POLICY MANAGER WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CHILDREN PROUD CO SPONSORS AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I'LL HANDLE IT ON ON BEHALF OF NEXT AND CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. THE THIRTY AS WE HAVE A STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORING AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JIM LINDBERGH ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT Q.. LONDON GRAVITY WILL LEGAL SERVICES OUR PRISONS ARE CHILDREN IS STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND AS YOU COME FORWARD I'D LIKE TO CONFIRM WITH THE AUTHOR. THAT YOU WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENT THAT WE HAD REQUESTED DEALING WITH -- GOOD A KIND OF CLOSING -- THE CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE DISCLOSURE OF THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS YES THERE'S A PRIVACY AMENDMENT AND APOLOGIES FOR MY NOT OPENING WITH -- THERE'S A COUPLE OF TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE PRIVACY AMENDMENT THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING AND I YES I AM TAKING THOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OBJECTION IS BUT PLEASE STEP FORWARD -- THOSE IN OPPOSITION TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- LARRY MORE SOME BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO SB THREE TEN AS WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL ALL FELONS. EXCEPT THOSE INCARCERATED AT THE TIME OF THEIR JURY SERVICE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE ON A JURY. THIS IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE COMMITTED SERIOUS FELONIES VIOLENT FELONIES CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN OR SEX OFFENSES. AND REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY FELONIES THEY'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF COMMITTEES. WE BELIEVE THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE JURY PROCESS. AND WOULD RESULT IN MORE COSTLY AND TIME COLLECTION OR TIME CONSUMING SELECTION OF JURIES. IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THAT SOME FELONS MAY HARBOR DEEP SEEDED BIAS AGAINST PROSECUTORS AS A RESULT OF THEIR FELONY CONVICTIONS. IN WHAT MANNER WILL PROSECUTORS BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AS TO WHETHER SUCH BIASES EXIST WILL IT HAPPEN IN OPEN COURT IN WHICH PERSONS CONVICTED OF FELONIES WILL HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED FELONY CONVICTIONS. WILL THE PROSECUTOR OR DEFENSE ATTORNEY BE ENTITLED TO KNOW THE NATURE OF THE FELONY CONVICTION OR WHETHER THE PERSON IS CURRENTLY ON PAROLE OR OTHER SUPERVISED RELEASE. IS ALSO NOT HARD TO IMAGINE THAT SOME JURORS WILL BE SERIOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE LEARNING THAT THEY MAY BE SERVING ON A JURY WITH A PERSON CONVICTED AND POSSIBLY STILL ON PAROLE. FOR A SERIOUS OR VIOLENT OR SEXUALLY MOTIVATED FELONY AND MAY SEEK TO BE EXCUSED FROM JURY SERVICE FOR THAT REASON. THE BIAS ALSO COULD WORK AGAINST DEFENDANTS SINCE A FELON WHO WAS ON PROBATION OR PAROLE MIGHT FEAR REPERCUSSIONS OF HERE SHE VOTES TO ACQUIT THE DEFENDANT. AT LAST CHECK FORTY NINE STATES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE ENTIRE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM ALL RESTRICT FELONS FROM SERVING AS JURORS. IN TWENTY EIGHT STATES AND THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE PERMANENT BARRING A FELON FROM JURY SERVICE FOR LIFE IN MOST REMAINING STATES CONVICTED FELONS MAY NOT SERVE AS JURORS. UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF THEIR SENTENCE WHICH INCLUDES PAROLE AND PROBATION. THESE ARE SENSIBLE RESTRICTIONS THAT HAVE EXISTED SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THIS NATION THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE ALSO MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN DENYING A FELON THE EXERCISE OF HIS OR HER RIGHT TO VOTE. VOTING IS A SOLITARY ACTION THE DOES NOT OTHERWISE IMPEDE ANY OTHER LAWFUL EXERCISE OF RIGHTS AS WOULD SERVING ON A JURY WHICH MAY COMPROMISE THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL FOR BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE. THANK YOU. WE ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU SIR -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THEN WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MARCHING IN HEARING ON WE'LL START WITH SENATOR ALLEN AND SENATOR BOAR JUST TO TO RAISE YOUR HAND. AND THEN A SENATOR UMBERG. AND IT'S AN URGENT I GUESS MY QUESTION THE OPPOSITION I'VE SERVED ON A JURY AND I WAS. SERVED ON JURY WALLS SENATOR -- DIVE SAW THE WHOLE WIDE HERE I PROCESS PLAY OUT THE ASK QUESTIONS THEY FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE'S IN THE THE PROBE AS BEST THEY CAN. OUR WHAT WOULD STOP A PROSECUTOR FROM ASKING THE SAME KINDS OF THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT THEY ASK OF ANY POTENTIAL JEREMY JUST BECAUSE FIVE YEAH. SOMEONE MAY HAVE BEEN A CONVICTED FELON THEY MAY BE THE BROTHER OF CONVICTED FOUND IN THE MIDST OF THE SAME BIASES AND THOSE OF THE THAT'S UP TO THE PROSECUTOR. TO THE FIGURE OUT AND DISEASE THE TERM WHERE THEY WANT TO KICK HIM OFF AT A JUROR JURY POOL OR NOT. THE BROTHER OF A CONVICTED FELON IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN A CONVICTED FELON WHO IS SITTING ON A JURY YOU'RE ASKING A PHONE FIRST TO DISCLOSE. IN OPEN COURT THAT HE OR SHE HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY AND IT MAY LEAD TO QUESTIONS THAT ARE ICREDIBLY INTRUSIVE FOR THAT -- PERSPECTIVE JURORS WELL WHETHER CRIMES OR SEXUAL NATURE CHILD MOLESTATION RAPE MURDER WHATEVER THOSE CRIMES MAYBE AND THESE PEOPLE MAY STILL BE ON PAROLE OR PROBATION. I'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR THAT'S A GOOD POINT TWO YEARS SO WHAT'S THE PROCESS TO IT SO SURELY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF POTENTIALLY VERY SENSITIVE QUESTIONS THAT THAT COULD COULD BE ASKED IN THE COULD CAUSE TROUBLE. FOR THE PERSON BEING ASSN BY THE WAY IS JUST SOMEONE WHO IS. ORDERED TO SHOW UP THE COURTS -- YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP BECAUSE THEY KNOW SO THEY WANT TO DO SO WE GOT SOME EXPERTS HERE -- WHAT WHAT WHAT HOW WOULD HOW DO YOU RESPOND AS I I YOU KNOW WE DO WANT TO PROTECT THAT? THE PROCESS WE ALSO WANNA PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THROUGH THE CHAIR. THANK YOU WELL FIRST I WANT TO CORRECT THE RECORD. IT IS INACCURATE THAT FORTY NINE STATES PREVENT FELONS FROM BEING ON THE JURY IN FACT -- COLORADO ILLINOIS MICHIGAN IN RHODE ISLAND AS WELL AS MAIN IN OREGON ALLOW PERSONS WITH FORMER FELONY CONVICTIONS AS LONG AS THEIR SENTENCES ARE COMPLETED THE SERVANT A JURY. AND THE A THE THIS IS NOT AN THE ANYWAY WE'LL WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW. CONVICTED FELONS TO SERVE ON THE JURY AFTER A STATUTORILY DEFINED PERIOD. AND THERE'S OTHERS TO ALLOW. UNLESS STATE THERE WERE JUST CERTAIN CRIMES SO WE WE ARE BEHIND IN THAT WE EXCLUDE ANY FORMALLY CONVICTED PERSON. I FORMALLY FELONY CONVICTED PERSON FROM SERVING ON A JURY NOW IS TO THE CENTER ALLEN YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT. THAT THE PRIVACY ISSUE SO WE WE ARE TAKING THE AMENDMENT -- AND SO. I THINK THAT -- I'M [inaudible] HOLD ON ALL RIGHT SO THE AMENDMENT IS THAT LITIGANTS SEEKING TO OBTAIN COPIES OF THE LISTS OF ALL JURORS NAMES. INCLUDING THE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF ALL PERSONS WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS JURORS -- IN SUPPORT OF A MOTION TO QUASH THE VENEER OR IN DISCOVERY FOR THAT MOTION SHOULD BE PROVIDED COPIES OF THE LIST UPON REQUEST. TO BE USED ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE MOTION TO QUASH AND THEN RETURN TO THE COURT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE LITIGATION OF THE MOTION. IT IS YEAH IT'S ON PAGE OF SIX RIGHT BEFORE STAKEHOLDER POSITIONS [inaudible] SENATOR -- THIS WOULD BE ALLOW. FOR THE PROSECUTOR TO FIND OUT WHETHER THERE IS A CONVICTION AND OR OR THEY HAVE THE NAMES THEY COULD RUN THE NAMES AT THE IDEA [inaudible] SO. WHEN IT WOULD YU LIKE TO RESPOND UP WILL HAVE THE WITH THOSE UNITS HAVE A QUESTION RIGHT SO I DO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT? WOULD BE WE WE'RE BEING SYMPATHETIC TO RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT BIAS TO ADDRESS HIS QUESTION. HIS STATEMENTS ABOUT BIASED EVERY JURY AUTOMATIC MY BIAS. AS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE HERE HERE WE ARE RIGHT WE HAVE A BILL THAT SEEKS TO HELP. TO RE INTEGRATE. FOLKS TO HAVE DONE THEIR TIME COME BACK INTO SOCIETY AND PARTICIPATES ASIDE INCLUDE SERVING ON A ON A JURY I NOW. A PROSECUTOR WORTH THEIR SALT. IS GONNA TRY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF THE VARIOUS -- JURORS RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE BEFORE WHEN THEY'RE MAKING JURY SELECTION. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW -- IF THERE'S SOME WAS CONVICTED AS A TRIAL OF A FELONY IF THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE CASE. HOW DO WE PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THAT PERSON? ARE YOU KNOW AND AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT RAKED OVER THE COALS IN FRONT OF THIS BIG JURY POOL. I SO AS TO YOU KNOW BOTH MEET THE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE -- WHILE ALSO -- YOU KNOW IT COULD FORMING IT WITH THE VOIR DIRE PROCESS IN TWO WAYS -- IN EVERY JURY SELECTION PROCESS THERE'S USUALLY A WRITTEN QUESTIONNAIRE -- THAT'S DISTRIBUTED TO JURORS BEFORE THEY SIT DOWN AND START ANSWER QUESTIONS ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS IS HAVE YOU OR ANYONE CLOSE TO YOU BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY OR HAD A CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT'S A STANDARD QUESTION ON IN IN ON THE FORM IN ALMOST EVERY CASE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD THAT EXPERIENCE. BUT THOSE ARE USUALLY DISTRIBUTION IF THEY'RE NOT THE COURT ASKED THAT QUESTION IF THE PERSON WANTS TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION IN PRIVATE THEY CAN DO THEY REQUEST TO GO INTO CHAMBERS THE SAME IS WOULD BE TREATED OF A VICTIM OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SETTLE SO. CASE AND THEY AND THE COURTS AS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS WHAT'S PERSONAL TO YOU WE CAN GO INTO CHAMBERS WHERE ONLY THE LAWYERS AND WE WILL SEAL THE TRANSCRIPT AND THAT GOES ON EVERYDAY AND IN EVERY SINGLE TRIAL. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES PUBLIC. OCCUR. OKAY SO TWO DIFFERENT OKAY VERY GOOD -- SENATOR BORCHERS YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE TWO WAYS THAT -- THE JURY ROLES ARE -- ARE ARE MADE. ARE MADE FROM THE LIST BUT THERE IS A THIRD THAT OTHERS USE WHAT'S THAT THIRD. THERE'S A LOT TO OTHER OF LIST THIS LEGISLATION IS PROPOSING ADDING TAX FILING -- A UTILITY LISTS -- AND AND THE STANDARD VOTER REGISTRATION AND DIVINE MOTOR VEHICLES. NUMBER OF STATES USE OTHER KINDS OFLIST ALASKA WHICH HAS THE THE MOST COOPERATIVE JURY POOL USES THEIR REWARD OF THE MONEY FOR ALL CITIZENS LIST. AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BE SUMMONED IS STILL A SERVER IS ON THAT LIST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE BUT BUT A NUMBER OF STATES ARE USING. A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LISTS. ENTER AN ARC ARC OUR STATE HAS ALLOWED FOR THAT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A PRESUMPTION THAT THOSE TWO LISTS DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLE AND VOTER REGISTRATION. ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CROSS SECTION. AND THAT PRESUMPTION IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH IN IN THIS BILL. AB ON EXTERNAL STAND THIS. THIS THIS BILL -- NOT ONLY APPLIES TO THE THE FOLKS WHO HAD -- CRIMINAL RECORD BUT THE RULES THEMSELVES WILL BE -- EXPANDED BY USING THESE OTHER LESS RIGHT. DO WE HAVE ANY REASON TO THINK THAT JUST THE LATTER. EXPANDING THE LIST WOULD GIVE US GREATER PARTICIPATION AND GREATER DIVERSITY REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION -- IF ED THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY ANSWER THESE. CERTAINLY EXPANDING THE LIST WILL HELP WITH A BROADER JURY POOL BUT AS I MENTIONED WITH OUR CURRENT PROHIBITION [inaudible] A THIRD. OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE EXCLUDED FROM JURIES. JUST WITH THE RULE THAT EXCLUDES ANY EX FELON. SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHER LIST WE MIGHT ADD WE ARE STILL EXCLUDING. AT LEAST A THIRD. OF THE BLACK RESIDENT MALE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. UNLESS WE ACT ON THIS -- THANK YOU FOR OF SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU MANAGER A COUPLE OF ISSUES ONE IS -- OR COMMENTS -- ONE WE DO ONE X. BEEN THE JURY POOL OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR EXPLORING THAT WITH ALL OF US SECONDLY OF I'VE SPENT A LOT OF MY CAREER. TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE ON JURIES OR TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EXPAND OF THE POOL CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU TO WANT TO ACTUALLY. SERVE AND THEN ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF OTHERS THAT THAT YOU WANT. TO INCREASE THE JURY POOL -- I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ONCE SOMEONE IS COMPLETELY -- SENDS THEIR FULL CIVIL RIGHTS SHOULD BE RESTORED. THE QUESTION IS IS I LOOK AT THE BILL IT SAYS THIS ONLY -- EXCLUDES PERSONS WHEN THEY'RE INCARCERATED BUT THE SENTENCE TYPICALLY CONTINUES BEYOND INCARCERATION WHETHER IT'S SUPERVISED RELEASE PAROLE OR PROBATION. SO SOMEONE'S ON SUPERVISED RELEASE WOULD THEY BE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE ON IT ON THE JURY. YES A CITY UNDER THIS BILL YES OKAY. I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT SOMEONE HASN'T COMPLETED THEIR SENSE UNTIL THEY'VE COMPLETED SUPERVISED RELEASE PROBATION OR PAROLE. THAT POINT IN TIME THEN THEY SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS THAT ONE WOULD DO -- PRIOR TO HAVING A FELONY CONVINCE MY PERSONAL VIEW. SO I I I'M HOPING YOU'LL CONSIDER THAT AMENDMENT THAT THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO THOSE WHO'VE COMPLETED THEIR SENSE. THE I BELIEVE IT WAS SENATOR JONES HAD A QUESTION. WELL LET ME ASK MORE DIRECTLY -- BECAUSE THAT'S MY CONCERN AS WELL AND YOUR FIRST PHONE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THIS SO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE BRINGING IT FORWARD AND AND GETTING OUR ATTENTION ON IT. I THINK IS GOOD -- I COULD SERVE CERTAINLY SUPPORT -- THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL BUT I I SURE CENTER -- BURGERS -- CONCERNS I THINK I WOULD TAKE IT MAYBE ONE MORE STEP FURTHER IN THAT. YOU KNOW ONCE OF FELONS -- CIVIL RIGHTS ARE RESTORED -- I THINK THIS SENDS A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO THAT PERSON. THAT SOCIETY IS MAKING AN INVESTMENT. INTO THAT PERSON AND WE TRUST YOU. THIS IS A BIG DEAL SERVING ON A JURY -- AND SO HOW HOW DO YOU DRESS THAT I MEAN WHY WHY NOT PUT SOME RESTRICTIONS RIGHT OR YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT -- I GUESS AS MICHAEL WHY NOT. BUT SOME LIMITATIONS ON IT. SO THERE IS A BILL. CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD GIVE VOTING RIGHTS -- TO PERSONS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ON PAROLE OR PROBATION. WE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT OBVIOUSLY ALLOWS FORMERLY CONVICTED FELONS TO VOTE -- BUT IT STILL RESTRICTS IF YOU'RE ON PROBATION OR PAROLE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LENGTH OF TIME. THAT WE NOW REQUIRE THAT WE HAVE MANY -- PROBATIONARY PERIOD'S -- IN EFFECT WE WE WE HAVE SOME SENSE IS THAT BASICALLY KEEP A PERSON ON OF PAROLE RATHER FOR ALMOST. FOR ONE TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS SO IN EFFECT WE'RE PREVENTING THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS FOR EVER BEING RESTORED. SO GIVEN THAT THE OTHER BILL'S GOING THROUGH I CAN'T PRESUME THAT IT WOULD PASS. BUT WHAT I THINK IS APPROPRIATE IS THAT YOUR FULL CIVIL RIGHTS SHOULD BE RESTORED AND THERE ARE OTHER STATES WHO HAVE DONE THIS. ONCE YOU HAVE. YOU LEFT YOUR INCARCERATION. AND BUT THAT'S MY OWN VIEW -- AND CLEARLY THE VIEWS OF THOSE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL WHO ARE ALSO SUPPORTING THE BILL THAT WOULD RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS. TO PEOPLE THAT ARE ON PAROLE I'M [inaudible] BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY -- AS WE MOVE THE BILL FORD IF WE CONFRONT -- CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS -- THOSE WILL BE CONSIDERED BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY RIGHT NOW TRYING -- TO BOTH WRISTS DEUCE RECIDIVISM AND RESTORE PEOPLE'S CIVIL RIGHTS -- SO WITH WITH THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT A BILL LIKE THIS I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS ONE TODAY. ALTHOUGH NO TODAY BUT IF AS YOU MOVE IT FORWARD IF YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE HAVING TO AMEND IT -- I WANT TO KNOW SO THAT. MAYBE I CAN VOTE FOR YOU KNOW LATER ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS RIGHT A CHURCH THE I'M I'M ALSO GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A CONVERSATION -- THE NOTION THAT THAT IT SOMEONE SEARCH TIME IN PRISON THEY GET OUT AND IF THEY ARE STILL ON PAROLE -- THEY ARE NOT DISTANT THEY ARE NOT TOTALLY FREE FROM THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE AND SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE GOING FORWARD A QUESTION TO ASK -- WHETHER IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE ONCE THEY HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE TERMS OF THEIR PROBATION OR PAROLE THAT THIS WOULD BE -- SOMETHING TO WHICH THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED AND AND THAT SOCIETY WOULD BE HONORED TO PROVIDE FOR THEM. AGAIN I THINK IT'S SAID THAT AN ISSUE THAT'S WORTHY OF FURTHER DISCUSSION BUT I AM GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK -- THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND TRY. TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW THE IRONY IS SAID IN A LOT OF OUR RED STATE FRIENDS THEY ARE BEEN A LOT MORE WILLING -- TO OPERATE OFF OF REDEMPTION AND SECOND CHANCES THAN WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO. IT'S KIND OF A A BIT OF A TWEENER BUT I I THINK THAT IT'S WORTHY OF MOVING THE BILL FORWARD TODAY SO DO WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER A CASKET WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU -- FIVE IN FUTURE I WILL GET THE STATISTICS ON HOW MANY PEOPLE WE KEEP ON PAROLE AND FOR HOW LONG. AND YET WE EXPECTED THEM TO FULLY REINTEGRATE INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES WE EXPECT THEM TO GET A JOB WE EXPECT THEM TO GET HOUSING WE EXPECT IN FACT WE WE WANT THEM. AND YET WE DENY THE MOTHER CIVIL RIGHTS. AND SO ON I THINK WERE AT LEAST IN MY BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I'M TRYING TO BRING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION AND TRYING TO SHOW THAT. BY RESTORING CIVIL RIGHTS WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO A PERSON'S ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE BOTH THEIR OWN. VIEW OF THEMSELVES AND IT JUST FROM WHAT ELSE WE EXPECT OF THEM SO THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE IN THE BILL. IN ADDITION TO OF COURSE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT THING OF A JURY OF YOUR PEERS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHO IS A VERY COMMONLY. THE DEFENDANT IN A JURY TRIAL. BUT IT IS -- TO NOT HAVE ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S BLACK RESIDENTS TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE -- BLACK MALE RESIDENTS DEFINITELY -- IT INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY FOR TO BE A JURY OF YOUR PEERS THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I WILL YOUR AYE VOTE I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DATA BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. SO ALL RIGHT THERE IS A MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATOR PROBES PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HIGH JACKSON I BORDERS. BORDERS NO ALAN. ALLEN HI CABALLERO. COVER YEAR ALL I JONES. JONES NO MONEY. MONEY AYE STERN [inaudible] NUMBER. WHY CASKEY HI MY CASKEY I? ALL RIGHT HEAD THE BILL HAS. FIVE FIVE TWO TWO THAT BILL IS OUT AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN WE HAVE A FULL HOUSE HERE SO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. TWENTY FIVE WHICH PROVIDES A GREEN HOLD JUST A SECOND LET'S WAIT TO THE DOORS CLOSE. AND BEFORE YOU START IF -- I'M NOT MISTAKEN THAT THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU HAVE AGREED TO TAKE. OF ON PAGE TWENTY ONE COMMENTS TEN AND ELEVEN THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD THOSE WILL BE AUTHORS MINNOWS THOSE ARE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. CORRECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SB TWENTY FIVE WHICH PROVIDES A GREEN SUSTAINABLE FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF BUILDING FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS PER YEAR AND TO REBUILD AND INVEST. IN OUR POOREST EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE CENTS IS TRACK OTHERWISE KNOWN AS OPPORTUNITIES ZONES THAT THAT EXIST IN EVERY SINGLE SENATE DISTRICT. SB TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES LEAD AGENCIES TO GO THROUGH THE FULL SEQUEL PROCESS INCLUDING THE IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION MEASURES. SB TWENTY FIVE IS PER SCRIPTED IN NATURE AND SETS A STANDARD FOR QUALITY PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. REQUIRING LEED GOLD CERTIFICATION ZERO NET EMISSIONS AND ZERO NET ENERGY IMPACT AND IT REQUIRES UP 275% OF THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE IN MIXED USE PROJECTS. TO BE DEDICATED TO HOUSING WITH A MINIMUM OF 40% OF THE UNITS BEING AFFORDABLE WITH A THIRTY YEAR LOCK DOWN ON THE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS. SB TWENTY FIVE ALLOWS FOR COURT TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND TO CONSIDER LAKE COMMENTS AND IT PROTECTS WORKERS WITH PREVAILING WAGE AND SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE REQUIREMENTS. IT WILL GIVE INVESTORS CERTAINTY THAT THEIR PROJECT WILL NOT BE UNDULY DELAYED FOR YEARS BY SEQUEL LITIGATION THAT OFTEN HAS NO BASIS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE BUT IS USED BY NIMBIS OUR BUSINESS COMPETITORS. TO SLOW AND STALL OR KILL PROJECTS. SB TWENTY FIVE DOES THIS BY SIMPLY REQUIRING THE COURTS TO REACH A FINAL DISPOSITION IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS. PRIDE PRIVATE INVESTORS. WE'LL BE POURING UP TO SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE ESTIMATE INTO THE NATION'S POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. CALIFORNIA IS COMPETING WITH EVERY OTHER STATE FOR THESE PRIVATE FUNDS AND NEEDS TO GIVE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES EVERY TOOL TO GAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. SB TWENTY FIVE IS THAT TOOL. WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF SALINAS MAYA CINEMAS OPENED ITS FIRST LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA AND IT CHOOSE CHOSE A SITE IN SALINAS IS REDEVELOPMENT AREA? IT WAS THE FIRST PROJECT THAT WAS BUILT IT TRANSFORM CITY AFTER COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT BEGAN TRANSFORMING A BLIGHTED NEIGHBORHOOD. SB TWENTY FIVE DOES NOT COST THE STATE ANY FUNDS BUT IT WILL HELP OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO PACKAGE THEIR OWN OPPORTUNITIES ON PROJECTS INTO ATTRACTIVE COMPUTE COMMUNITY TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS. THESE COMMUNITIES NEED MORE THAN JUST HOUSING THEY NEED JOBS AND THEY NEED COMMUNITY SERVICES LIKE MOVIE THEATERS THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN PROGRAM WILL SUNSET. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO WE MUST ACT NOW SO THE CAPTION CALIFORNIA CAN CAPTURE THESE FUNDS. WITH A FIVE YEAR SUNSET DATE SB TWENTY FIVE MEETS THE GOVERNOR'S AND THE STATE'S INTEREST TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO THE MARKET THAT THE GOOD PROJECTS THAT SB TWENTY FIVE WILL PRODUCE. SHOULD THEY STILL BE CHALLENGING COURT WILL NOT BE DRAGGED UNDER WATER IN OTHER WORDS IF A PROJECT. STILL IF A PROJECT IT ADMIN AT IF IN SB WENTY FIVE PROJECT STILL GET SUED ODDS ARE THE CHALLENGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT. THESE ARE THE EXACT LAWSUIT WE SHOULD BE DISCOURAGING AND SB TWENTY FIVE DOES THAT VERY WELL. I'M COMMITTED TO INCREASING THE SIZE HOUSING SUPPLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT TO BRING AFFORDABILITY TO THE HOUSING MARKET. I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO DECK TACKLING DECADES OF INSUFFERABLE POVERTY FOR THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN NINE CENSUS TRACKS IDENTIFIED BY GOVERNORBROWN'S ADMINISTRATION AS CALIFORNIA BLESS YOU.% AS CALIFORNIA CENSUS TRACKS IDENTIFIED. WITH IT AARON THEY ALSO CONTAIN CALIFORNIA'S POOREST JOB POOR COMMUNITIES WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY WELL IT BEEN -- BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY SENATOR ALLEN IS THE ISSUE OF THAT WILL EASE ARE THE WILD LIFE URBAN INTERFACE OWNS -- AND THE CONCERN. THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED BY THAT AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT'S NOT A NOT MY INTENTION THAT THIS WOULD BE USED IN THOSE OWNS -- BUY AND SO I'LL EXCEPT THE AMENDMENT BOB IS SUBJECT TO I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MAPS SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW THEY OVERLAY I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IT'S I THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT JUST FINE BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THESE. OPPORTUNITIES OWNS ARE. ARE PART OF THE WE MAPS BUT IT'S IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US TO LOOK AT HIM. AND SO -- WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY SO BEFORE WE HAVE OUR WITNESSES -- WE HAD TALKED ABOUT -- CAN CONSTRUCTING THIS A BIT SO THAT THAT THIS WOULD BE A PILOT PROJECT -- WHICH WOULD BE APPLICABLES IN YOUR DISTRICTS -- ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT NO MA'AM RIGHT. I THE REASON I'M ASKING IS THAT I THINK AND I'D LIKE STE MY COLLEAGUES TO BE AWARE OF THIS. THAT ARE WHEN YOU COMBINE THIS WITH SB SIX TWENTY ONE WHICH APPLIES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THIS BECOMES A VERY BROAD PROJECT AND THE RESULT I THINK IS. AGAIN VERY FAR TO SIGNIFICANT WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITH THE COURT THIS WILL OPEN IT. EVEN FAR FARTHER -- AND AGAIN EXPEDITING REVIEW. OF WE HAVE SECRET HERE IN INHERENTLY PRIORITIZING THESE CASES OVER EVERYTHING ELSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WRONGFUL EVICTION SO WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER -- CIVIL RIGHTS CASES OR PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES WERE LOST IN THE FIRES -- THIS WILL PREEMPT ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND WILD. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THESE THINGS TO BEGIN WITH -- I AM -- PERSONALLY IMPACTED BY THE OVER WHAT I THINK THE OVER BROAD NATURE OF THIS PILOT PROJECT THE IS. A OR RATHER IT DEAD DOING SOMETHING BEYOND A PILOT PROJECT IT'S JUST TOO BROAD AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED -- I THINK IT WILL I THINK IT WOULD BE. A VERY POSITIVE THING ADDRESSING YOUR DISTRICT BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE -- SIGNIFICANT NEEDS THEIR BUT TO EXPAND THIS STATEWIDE IN ALL AREAS I THINK IS A WAY OVER REGION I WOULD. ASK YOU TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER A NARROWING IT BECAUSE I FRANKLY CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS IN AS BROAD AS IT IS AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY COLLEAGUES FEEL. BUT I THINK THIS IS -- TO TO GET INTO THESE OPPORTUNITY STONE'S THERE ARE MANY OF THEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE BILL SAYS IF YOU TAKE EVEN. IF IT IS FUNDED IN WHOLE OR IN PART COULD BE A VERY. SMALL INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT WEEK WE WOULD FIND OURSELVES I THINK -- OVERWHELMED IN INUNDATED BY THE SEQUEL CASES -- AND I THINK THAT THAT. THAT IS AN OVER REACH SO -- YOUR CALL IF -- I WOULD URGE YOU TO DO THAT I IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT AS WE GO FORWARD I INVITE MY COLLEAGUES TO SHARE THEIR POINTS OF VIEW AS WELL. BUT WITH THAT -- GET OFF AS WE PROCEED. OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU WITNESSES TO TESTIFY TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE AND WILL HAVE A FURTHER DISCUSSION AS A THE TESTIMONY PROCEEDS. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEBBIE BAUER-KAHAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE VIEW OF OUR FORTY ONE HABITAT AFFILIATES THAT OPERATE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE ALONG SIDE SENATOR CABALLERO TO WHOLE HEARTEDLY SUPPORT SB TWENTY FIVE IN ITS ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE APPLICATION OF THE CALIFORNIA BAR MENTAL QUALITY ACT. SIMPLER AND FAIRER. HABITAT KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT SEQUEL IS TO MAINTAIN AND PROTECT OUR STATE'S ENVIABLE NATURAL BEAUTY WE ALSO KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF ITS APPLICATION. ON THE GROUND HAS AN ALARMING AFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF DEVELOPERS. TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR WORKING FAMILIES. FOR NEARLY SIXTEEN MONTHS THE HABITAT DEVELOPMENT ON JEFFERSON AVENUE IN REDWOOD CITY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. STATE NEEDLESSLY STALLED AS WE FOUGHT A BASELESS SEAQUEST LAWSUIT. IT WAS FILED BY LOCAL BUSINESS WITH A TRACK RECORD OF INITIATING SEQUEL LITIGATION AGAINST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA. TWENTY LOCAL FAMILIES WITH HOUSEHOLD INCOMES BETWEEN FIFTY AND 80% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. SHOULD BE GETTING READY TO MOVE IN AND BY THESE HOMES RIGHT NOW. INSTEAD THE PROJECT WAS UNNECESSARILY DELAYED BY AN EFFORT TO RAISE COSTS HIGH ENOUGH TO KILL THE PROJECT. WELL I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE ARE NEARLY READY TO SEND OUT GROUND BREAKING CEREMONY INVITATIONS IT HAS BEEN A LONG HARD EFFORT TO GET TO THIS POINT. AND NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF BEHIND SCHEDULE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT BY THE TIME WE WERE SERVED WITH THE LAWSUIT THE PROJECT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. METICULOUSLY REVIEWED AND UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE LAWSUIT CAME IN LATE AND WAS BASED ON LATE OMMENTS. IN OUR CASE WE WORKED HARD HAND WE HAD WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH MUNICIPAL PLANNERS. AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WE KNEW OUR ENVIRONMENTALIST ESTIMATES WERE THOROUGH AND WE ARE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAD UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE DEVELOPMENT. AT A MEETING PACKED WITH REDWOOD CITY FAMILIES. FOR TOO MANY AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS IN CALIFORNIA SEQUEL LOSSES LAWSUITS IT SEEMS ARE JUST A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. SIMPLY BY ISSUING A LAWSUIT THE PLAINTIFF CAN CAUSE MAJOR DELAYS AND MAJOR COSTS THAT'S WHY THE SENSIBLE REFORMS OF SEQUEL LITIGATION LIKE THOSE PROPOSED IN SB. TWENTY FIVE WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT CAN BE BUILT FOR WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. HOLLY FOR MANY ALSO WE HAVE A HABITAT FOR MANY CALIFORNIA FOR TECH OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT BUT ALSO TO CLARIFY. IT DOES NOT APPLY TO EVERY PROJECT WITHIN OPPORTUNITIES OWN JUST THOSE THAT ARE FUNDED BY OPPORTUNITY FUNDS. AND ANOTHER WAY THAT THE BILL IS TECHNICALLY NARROW BY PROJECTS AS THEY MUST HAVE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE AND THAT'S NOT EVERY PROJECT FUNDED BY THE DOLLARS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MANAGER MEMBERS AS ARE THE OTHER HALF IS THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL THANK YOU WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT WITH SOME ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND TRYING TO TARGET IN THESE MOST DISADVANTAGED AREAS WHERE THERE IS NOT A LARGE NEED FOR AFFORDABILITY -- WE LIKE THIS BILL WE OPPOSE SB SIX TWENTY ONE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WE ALSO BELIEVE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS PRESENT A LOT OF GIVEAWAYS TO DEVELOPERS. THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE SET FORTH IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL ACTUALLY. REASONABLE AND THEY COMBINED WITH OTHER ONES DEAL WITH IN AB NINE HUNDRED WITH THE INCLUDE LABOR PROTECTIONS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WE THINK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT CAN CURRY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BUT ALSO HAVE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUILDING THOSE PROJECTS AND THAT'S WHAT'S INVOLVED IN THIS BILL AND SO WE ARE AT YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU KEEPING IN MIND THAT IT SAYS. ALL OR ANY PORTION. OF FUNDING IN OPPORTUNITIES ON SO THAT'S GREATER THAN IT BEING THE SOLELY FUNDED BY AN OPPORTUNITIES ON THAT DATE. IF AN OPPORTUNITY ZONE -- IF THE FUNDING IS YOU KNOW ONE TENTH OF THE COST IT'S STILL WOULD COME WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THIS BILL SO. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO MENTION. AS FAR AS HABITAT GOES WHICH HAS PASSED OUT SIX TWENTY ONE WHICH IS A BILL THAT DEALS WITH. AFFORDABLE HOUSING VERY SPECIFICALLY SO THAT HAS BEEN COVERED IN THAT BILL AND I'M A BIG FAN A HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUT I THINK THERE'S AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT A WAY THAT WE CAN DO THIS. PRACTICALLY AND PRAGMATICALLY YES. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GET GOOD EVENING I GUESS NOW MADAM TURN MEMBERS CASSIE GILSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ALMOST GOOD NIGHT SO HERE WE GO. VERONICA LEVELS CREE STRATEGIES ON THE HAVE ON BEHALF OF WESTFIELD IN SUPPORT. VERY GOOD OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING TURN MEMBERS THEM FOR THE DIVISIONAL COUNCIL I WON'T REPEAT MY TESTIMONY FROM. SB SIX TWENTY ONE ALL OF THE SAME. REASONS THAT WE ARE OPPOSE EXCUSE ME OPPOSED TO THAT BILL WE ARE POSED HERE JUST A COUPLE OF CLARIFYING POINTS -- MADAM CHAIR. ONE OF THE THE MOMENT IN THE ANALYSIS I'M NOT. NOT THE PILOT ISSUE I'M TRYING TO CLARIFY THE TEN DAY NOTICE ISSUE. MADAM CHAIR SORRY. I'M TRYING TO CLARIFY IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS ALSO SUGGESTED AMENDMENT ABOUT THE TEN DAY NOTICE PROVISION THAT AT SOME PARTICULAR CONCERNS OF THE COUNCIL AND I DIDN'T HEAR. THE WHETHER THAT WAS TAKEN OR NOT. I'M NOT CLEAR I THERE WAS A IT WAS THURMOND MEANT NUMBER ONE AN AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS IS THE TEN DAY NOTICE. THEY THEY'RE BOTH OF THE THANK YOU THE GREAT VERY GOOD THANK YOU MY APOLOGIES SO AND THE THE FINAL POINT I'D MAKE IS THE POINT YOU WERE MAKING WHICH IS THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. IS INCREDIBLY BROAD -- IN IT AND IT'S NOT EVEN LIMITED TO HOUSING A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY WAS ALL ABOUT HOUSING BUT AS YOU KNOW. THE BILL IS CONSTRUCTED IN A WAY. WHETHER THE FUNDS ARE IN WHOLE OR IN PART USING UP TO REASONS BUT THAT. PROVISION IS NOT LIMITED TO JUST HOUSING PROJECTS SO THE SCOPE. AND ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST BILL THE INCREDIBLY BROAD SCOPE THIS HAS OF COURSE WOULD MAGNIFY THE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE COURTS AND LET AGAINST AND IT'S FOR THOSE REASONS THAT WERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THE BURNING DAWSON OF A SPHERICAL CALIFORNIA -- AGAIN WE'RE POSES SB TWENTY FIVE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT YOU -- WE WERE OPPOSED TO IT SB -- SIX TWENTY ONE ONE THING THAT I DO WANT TO ADD THOSE -- THIS BILL IS MAGNANIMOUS IN NATURE AND THAT AB NINE HUNDRED AND NO STANDARD SHOULD NOT BE THE STARTING POINT FOR DEVELOPMENT THOSE SHOULD BE THE THAT HONESTLY SHOULD BE A POINT THAT YOU GET TO OUR WE BELIEVE THAT SEEK REVIEW SHOULD BE THE FIRST POINT. AND THAT ANY JUDICIAL PROCESS OF FALLS IN THAT REVIEW IS JUST GOING TO THE SUPER PROCESS IT WHEN YOU PROVIDE EXTRA AGES REVIEW YOU ARE UNDERMINING SEQUEL ITSELF BECAUSE EXPOSURES REVIEW. I MEAN JUDICIARY VIEW IS ENFORCING MECHANISM BY WHICH SEQUEL IS IN FORCE -- ANOTHER THING THAT IS -- WE WANT TO POINT OUT IS. NOT ONLY IS BUILD MAGNANIMOUS IN THE OF THE PROJECTS IT APPLIES TO TALK NO IT'S ALSO DIFFER FROM MAYBE NINE HUNDRED SB. SEVEN FORTY THREE IN THAT DOES -- BILLS ONLY APPLIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS THIS REPLY THIS APPLIES TO BOTH MEDICAID AND MANY MITIGATED NECKLACE NEGATIVE DECORATIONS NEGATIVE DECORATIONS AND NOTICE OF EXEMPTIONS. THEREFORE THAT'S MORE PER CHALLENGES THAT COULD BE IMPACTING THE COURTS AS WELL AS THAT'S LIKELY BECAUSE OF THE AUTHOR AND SOME OF THE PROPONENTS KNOW THAT A LOT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. ARE THERE EXEMPTS OR THEY ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS -- SO THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS ARE STILL SOMEHOW EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ONLY GOING THROUGH. A SIX STATEMENT TIME FRAME GETTING EXPEDITED JST REVIEW WHICH AGAIN UNDERMINE SICK WAS A FORCING MECHANISMS FOR FOR THAT REASONS WE OPPOSE. SB [inaudible] FIVE THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D COME FORWARD NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. THOUSAND JOHNSON WITH PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LOS ANGELES AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSES THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU. IF ANYTHING ON THE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA VIRAL JUST ALLIANCES AND ON REYES PRODDING ENVIRONMENT THE SERVER CAN BE ACTION VINYL JUSTICE AND LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUST ACCOUNTABILITY. IN STRONG OPPOSITION FOR THIS BILL FOR MANY THE REASON SPOKE ABOUT TONIGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU. MOSSER AMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA WE GIVE CONSERVATION VOTERS WE ARE LISTED IN OPPOSITION ON THE ANALYSIS -- AND WE DO STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND PRINT BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THE DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT BRINGING A BACK -- AGAIN -- THIS IS WIDE OPEN ANY OPPORTUNITIES OWN ANY PROJECT [inaudible] OF I I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. ISSUE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT -- WAS BROUGHT BY A OF THE NEIGHBORING ATTORNEYS OFFICES I UNDERSTAND IT THEY WERE CONCERNED THE BUILDING WAS TOO HIGH FOR THE AREA. THE CASE WAS SETTLED QUICKLY. OF THE PROJECT PROCEEDED AS ORIGINALLY. APPROVED THE CHALLENGERS WERE HOPING IT WOULD COME DOWN A FLOOR TWO BUT SETTLED FOR MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS SO THEY GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING DATING GET WHAT THEY WANTED PER SE. BUT AGAIN. THIS IS THIS IS WHERE SHE WORKS. THERE WAS ANY INTERACTION YOU KNOW WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT GIVING TENANTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THEIR PIECE. OUR THIS IS WHAT. THIS IS WHAT SHE COULD THOMAS AND TO BE ABLE. TO BROADLY OPEN THIS UP AND HAVE A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY REVIEW PERIOD WHICH DOES NOT GIVE. THE PARTIES THE TIME NECESSARY -- IF THERE IS INDEED A A REAL CHALLENGE -- IN YOUR CASE. THERE WAS NO TRIAL NO DELAY. THE THE PARTIES ACTUALLY WROTE THE REQUESTED AN EXTENSION TO THE BRIEFING SCHEDULE BOTH SIDES -- AND AND AND SO WHO NO THIS IS WHERE THE SYSTEM WORKS. THIS BILL WITHOUT ANY KIND OF CONTAINMENT ARCHES BLOWS A HUGE HOLE IN IN THE SYSTEM AND THIS IS -- I I THINK A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT WE JUST DID THE BILL THAT ARE THAT ARE TALKS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I I THINK THAT IT IS. IT JUST AN UNREALISTIC EFFORT AND AGAIN I WOULD. LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE THE AUTHOR TO FOCUS THIS ON OPPORTUNITY STONE'S WITH IN. OF THE COUNTIES THAT ARE -- WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT -- YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THIS OUT BUT I THINK THE THIS IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY WREAK HAVOC ON OUR COURT SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PRIORITIES THAT THE SEQUEL CASES ARE GOING TO GET ARE GOING TO BE TO THE DETRIMENT. OF OTHER THINGS THAT I KNOW WE ALL HAVE FOUGHT HARD TO SEE AN END CARE DEEPLY ABOUT SO AGAIN I WOULD. I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER -- CONSIDER. A CHESTER CREATING THIS PILOT PROJECT. OF THIS IS JUST THE THE SCOPE AND THIS IS JUST I THINK OVERWHELMING. SO WITH THAT. US SENATOR BORCHERS HAS QUESTION AND SENATOR ALAN. IT'S REALLY DON'T WANT TO BELABOR -- THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED ON THE LAST ITEM -- I'M SUPPORTER OF THIS BECAUSE OUR HOUSING STOCK. IS AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE AND WE NEED TO TO TAKE ACTION TO TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM AT LEAST IN PART -- I WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING THIS -- TODAY -- I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. I DID -- FROM -- THE DAIS ON DISCUSSION IS THAT. I IS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND MAKE THE BILL BETTER. IN THE PROCESS. AND SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. IS THAT -- WE'VE HEARD SOME CONCERNS -- FROM. FROM FOLKS TODAY WE'LL PROBABLY HEAR MORE CONCERNS AS IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS. JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR. IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO STILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND -- IN. MAKE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS AS NEEDED -- ONE OF THOSE THAT. MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING -- DOWN THE ROAD MAYBE NOT TODAY BUT DOWN THE ROAD. IS THAT THE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. MAYBE PUTTING A THRESHOLD. MAYBE 25%. THIRTY TWO YOU FIGURE IT OUT BUT HE THAT EXAMPLE OF THAT 1%. COULD BE DISQUIETING -- TO TO SOME FOLKS -- SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU CONSIDER IT -- TO IN ORDER. TO EARN THE SUPPORT THAT I THINK THIS A PROPOSAL -- DESERVES. THANK YOU -- SENATOR ALAN YEAH ARE THESE -- THIS BILL. IS A TOUGH ONE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT I MEAN I THINK -- THERE IS A THEIR SERIES OF SCOPE ISSUES THAT THE THAT THE CHAIR BROUGHT UP I DO THINK THE IMPACT ON THE COURTS IS SIGNIFICANT AND AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT HAS TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD -- I GET I GUESS WE JUST ASK THE AUTHOR AND WHAT WHEN YOU YOU SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE -- I KNOW YOU YOU CARE ABOUT AND THE THE CALIBER QUALITY RECORDS HOW HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT HOW THIS MAY. IMPACT THE DOCKETS IN A WAY THAT AND AND AND AND AND PUT THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS AHEAD OF THE LIST. OF OTHER TYPES OF OF FIVE CASES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT FOR THAT QUESTION -- I A I APPRECIATE AND I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS. OF THE COURTS I A HAVE. VERY GOOD FRIENDS THAT CITIES JUDGES AND THAT HERE THESE KINDS OF CASES AS WELL AS VIC KINDS OF CASES THAT THE CHAIR HAS MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW I THE COURTS [inaudible] OUR FUNDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. WE DECIDE WHAT RESOURCES THEY NEED AND AND HOW TO FIND THEM AND SO -- WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT? THE LACK OF DEVELOPMENT IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES OWNED IS SIGNIFICANT WE'VE GOT NO PLANS TO DO ANY DEVELOPMENTS. IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT ARE GOING TO RELIEVE THE POVERTY AND PROVIDE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND SO I IF WE IF WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT PROVIDING THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES -- AND WE UNDERSTAND IT'S A CRISIS AND WE ALSO CONTROL THE PURSE STRINGS TO BE ABLE TO THIS IS A FIVE YEAR WINDOW OKAY NO REGARDLESS BUT I MADE SO. IT'S A LITTLE GETS OUT YOU HAVE TO BE A BIG CHAMPION FOR COURT -- ABSOLUTELY AND SO SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT BAD I I AM AND I WILL BE -- BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT. THAT WE WHAT WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE IS A MESSAGE TO THE MARKET. ON AND OFF I BELIEVE THAT. THAT THAT MESSAGE. LET'S ASSUME IT RESULTS IN LITIGATION [inaudible] THESE. BECAUSE OF THE GOOD WORK THAT THE E. YOUR STAFF AND YOU DID IN IN THE SENATE E. Q. -- THIS HAS THE HIGHEST. STANDARDS RIGHT NECESSARY AND SO. SO. I BELIEVE THAT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THE COURTS WILL BE LOOKING AT WILL BE EASIER TO EVALUATE BECAUSE OF THAT HIGH STANDARD. AND SO WE DO NEED TO FUNDED I BY WILL BE A CHAMPION FOR THAT -- AND AND WE'LL WE'LL SEE AFTER FIVE YEARS BECAUSE WILL COME BACK WITH A REPORT AS TO WHETHER IT WORKED WELL AND THAT'S AND I SUPPOSE I MEAN THE END OF THE DAY -- I I AM A WELL AWARE OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES -- IN PLAY IN THE OPRY'S ON YOU CERTAINLY HELPED EDUCATE ME ON THOSE -- THESE PROJECTS ALSO TO GO THROUGH SECRET AND I WILL I I DO HAVE TO PUSH BACK ON MY FRIEND SAYS OURS COMMENTS ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE ENVIRONMENT. AND AND AND THE THE THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME AREAS. BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY. I WILL RESPECTFULLY SAY THAT THE YOU KNOW THE IF THIS THE THE STANDARDS WE PUT IN HERE THERE OUTLINED ON PAGE. FOURTEEN LEED GOLD CERTIFICATION FOR EVERY PROJECT THAT WOULD HAVE. TO EITHER BE BUILT INTO THIS GHG NEUTRAL. ZERO NET ENERGY EMISSIONS. I THERE'S A WHOLE FLURRY OF LABOR RELATED REQUIREMENTS AND SIDE SO. THE SIGNIFICANT STUFF HIGH BAR TO BE HONEST YOU KNOW THERE WERE I THINK THERE WILL BE LESS PROJECTS BUILT UNDER THIS THEN -- IT IT CERTAINLY IF THESE REQUIREMENTS WHEN IN PLACE BUT YOU KNOW I I JUST ASK FOLKS I KNOW EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM CARES GREAT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT BUT I I JUST ASK US TO KIND OF CONTEMPLATE WHAT -- WHAT A GAME CHANGER IT BE IF WE STARTED BUILDING AT AT AT IN ON A ON A LARGE SCALE? AT LEAD GOLD LEVEL CALIBER. I MEAN THAT IS THAT IS THAT THAT IS SUCH A GAME CHANGER FROM EVERYTHING FROM ENERGY. TO THE OTHERS THE ANTI PROVISIONS IN THERE THAT REALLY TO TRAFFIC AND AND TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT -- YOU KNOW -- WATER -- EFFICIENCY AND AND I'M THAT THERE THERE'S JUST SO MUCH VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGAL CERTIFICATION IT IT'S A HIGH STANDARD FOR FOR CONSTRUCTION FOR BUILDINGS AND AS I SAY. YOU'VE ALSO INCLUDED GREENHOUSE GAS NEUTRAL WHICH IS HUGE AND ALSO IS THERE ANOTHER ENGINE MISSIONS. WITH EACH PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED HERE SO THOSE ARE REALLY HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL BARS I THINK THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF OF OF THIS BILL. OR CALL UPON SENATOR Y. KOWSKI I JUST LIKE TO NOTE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE -- OPPORTUNITY ZONES I HAVE HERE A AN ARTICLE -- WHERE A MISTER SCARAMUCCI SOMEWHERE I REMEMBER THE VERY SHORT LIVED PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN -- FOR A WEEK I THINK IT WAS -- TING A SWANK HOTEL FOR TAX CUTS AIMED AT POOR AREAS. SO WHILE THESE PROJECTS MIGHT BE LEED CERTIFIED IN ALL THIS GREAT STUFF. MR SCARAMUCCI WAS ON THE PHONE -- RECRUITING INVESTORS FOR A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS. ARE TRUSTS SEEKING THE CLAIM THE TAX INCENTIVES. BY INVESTING IN SOME OF OUR IN THE NEWLY CREATED OPPORTUNITY SOUNDS ONE OF FOR THE RE PROJECTS HE HAD -- THAT HE WAS PUSHING IS A MARKS THE HOTEL ON THE SIDE OF A GAS STATION IN OAKLAND. DURING A A SERIOUSLY THIS -- THIS IS BLOOMBERG ARTICLE AND HE SAID. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE YET TO GO TO OAKLAND CALIFORNIA -- THAT PART OF THE BAY AREA I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S FULLY GENTRIFYING. OAKLAND IS EFFECTIVELY BECOMING THEN BROOKLYN HEIGHTS OF SAN FRANCISCO. SO SORRY SAN FRANCISCO A BUT ANYWAY -- BEING A BOSTONIAN ANYTHING NEW YORK CITY AND I WAS. BAD BUT ANYWAY -- WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE BUILDING A SWANK BOUTIQUE HOTEL THERE IT'S GOING TO CREATE EXCESSIVE ECONOMIC GRANTS. FOR THE THE READ. SO MY QUESTION IS THAT WHAT WE WANT TO BE GIVING EXTRAORDINARY BENEFITS. TO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT SOME OF THESE VERY CLEVER CREATIVE AND NOT PARTICULARLY COMMITTED -- FOLKS ARE WILLING TO DO. WELL CANNOT SKITTLE CAPITALISM FOR YOU BUT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH -- ENCOURAGING -- THESE KIND OF SEE QUIRK -- EXPEDITED PROCESS SEES IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES ON SO I JUST THROW THAT OUT IN RESPONSE. TO SOME OF THE CAN IN ALL THESE MAY BE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS BUT IS THIS EXACTLY WHAT THESE ARE. OPPORTUNITY CELLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUNDED IS NOT HAVE TO BE A PUBLICLY FUNDED AS PART OF THE PROJECT. OPPORTUNITY ONES HERE CAN WE CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE I BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS TOLD BY THE AUTHOR THAT EVERYTHING HAD TO BE AT LEAST PARTIALLY PUBLICLY FUNDED TO BE. ELIGIBLE UNDER THE SPELL. THAT'S NOT THE CASE -- WITHOUT PROJECT SHE'S REFERRING TO BENEFITS AND WELL I'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE IT TO YOU I DIDN'T MAKE THIS UP THIS IS A FEDERAL. THIS IS FROM A BOOK A BLOOMBERG. THE OPPORTUNITY FUNDS ARE. ARE TAX CREDITS IS IS WHAT IT IS WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO AND AND WITH THE BILL ALLOWS IS IT CAN BE -- A TAX CREDIT [inaudible] A FUNDED. PROJECT OR IT CAN ALSO INCLUDE PUBLIC FUNDS TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE PUBLIC FUNDS AVAILABLE BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE EITHER IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR IN NUMBER PERCENTAGE. BUT BUT LET ME LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT. THAT MIGHT MY FRUSTRATION IS THE ONLY. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS OFFERED IS MAKE IT. A DISTRICT PILOT PROJECT -- AND AND THERE WASN'T ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT BIG THE PERCENTAGES OR YOU KNOW I'M IN AND TO ANSWER -- AT SENATOR -- BARGES QUESTION IS I'M ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO SIT AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WOULD WORK BEST IN WHAT WHAT DOESN'T WORK BEST -- BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN PART OF THIS DISCUSSION -- IT IT'S BEEN TAKE IT AS A PILOT PROJECT OR NOT AT ALL OUR WINDOWS SEVEN YEARS SO IF WE DON'T GET MOVING ON THIS. THEN NOTHING WILL BE BUILT WITH OPPORTUNITY BONE -- ZONE FUNDING BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET A PROJECT STARTED WITHIN THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S LEFT TO US AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON THAT WE MOVED ON TO AN EXPEDITED. JUDICIAL REVIEW DIDN'T TOUCH ANY THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WE IN FACT ENHANCE THEM. BECAUSE THAT GETS US TO WHERE WE NEED TO TO GO TO THEN ACCESS RESOURCES -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS SO -- SO I I MEAN I'M WILLING TO TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES AND AND AND AND LIMIT AND AND CHANGE NUMBERS BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN PROPOSED THAT HASN'T BEEN OFFERED IN I AM OPEN TO ALL OF THAT. WELL IT IS A DAY TO DAY -- HAPS WERE PERHAPS A LITTLE. DISAGREEMENT HERE I DID WE TALKED TO SET A FEW DAYS AGO ABOUT THE THE NOTION I'D MENTION THIS IS SO BROAD AND SUGGESTED PERHAPS. THAT WE COULD CREATE THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT WITHIN THE THE COUNTIES. THE THE THE COUNTIES IN WHICH YOU HAVE YOU YOU REPRESENT I THOUGHT THAT. WAS A VERY REASONABLE YOU KNOW OF CONCERN SO TO SAY WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IT IS NOT I SAID THAT WAS THE ONLY OFFER THAT WAS MADE WAS TO MAKE IT A PILOT PROJECT. WELL IT FOR THE NIGHT USE BUT YOUR RESPONSE WAS THAT THAT WASN'T OF INTEREST TO YOU AND WELL I I THOUGHT LINE HOW YOU YOU ASKED ME TO THINK ABOUT IT AND I DID AND ALL RIGHT. OKAY AND DECIDED NO OKAY. PART OF THE SENATOR Y. COUNTS KING [inaudible] BENEFIT OF THE THING YOU'RE THINKING ORDER PROPONENTS THINKING IS. YOU KNOW THE ONE THE PURPOSE IS TO SEEK WAYS TO HAVE THIS OPEN DISCUSSION THEY GIVE NOTICE TO THE COMMUNITY WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE HAVE BEEN. OCT ABOUT. ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT YOU HAD A FULL III ARE SO THAT YOU WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OF THE FULL BLOWN E. I. R. AND THEN IF IF YOU STILL HAD OBJECTION SAID WITH THESE WITH THE REQUIRED HEARINGS. THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THIS EXPEDITED HEARING THIS BILL INCLUDES A NOTICE OF EXEMPTION WHICH IS WHICH IS KNOWN. NORMALLY IN A THE DAY -- LEAD AGENCY MAKES A DETERMINATION THAT IT'S NOT GONNA BE DOESN'T HAVE A IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT OR NEGATIVE DECLARATION OR EVEN A MITIGATED DECLARATION THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS MY NEW IMPACT IT HAS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AND ALL THOSE ARE INCLUDED IN THE EXPEDITED -- SEE SEE WHAT MIKE MIKE AT LEAST THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS FULL BLOWN E. I. R. THAT WENT ON FOREVER AND AND THEY HAD ALL THESE PUBLIC HEARINGS VERSUS JUST A NEGATIVE TECH AND THEN THEY GET. EXPEDITED DID YOU DON'T MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE I THINK I MADE IT. YOU SEE MY THAT IS CORRECT IN. OKAY THAT IS THE REAL DEAL HOW DEL NOTICED YOU STILL HAVE HEARINGS. IN TERMS OF OF OF MAKING THE FINDINGS ON THOSE SO IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU JUST DO IT. MINISTERIAL A AND THEN THAT'S IT. THERE IS STILL A BECAUSE IT'S A PROJECT [inaudible] OKAY. SO ALL RIGHT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT MY STAFF AND OF THE INDICATED TO ME THAT. WE ALSO HAD OFFERED TO THE HOUSING AND TRANSIT ONLY AS AN OPTION WHICH WAS APPARENTLY ALSO REJECTED SO. WE WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH HERE I'M REALLY. I I JUST THINK. IF YOU HAVE. ALL OF THESE ISSUES TO HAVE THEM IN SUCH A CONSOLIDATED FASHION YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE. TO DO JUSTICE TO THE ISSUES AND AGAIN. I I THINK THAT THE CERTAINLY THE ABILITY TO FOCUS TO TO TRY THIS PILOT PROJECT I THINK -- GIVES YOU I THINK WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT I I THINK ANYTHING BEYOND THAT JUST CREATES SUCH A BROAD SWATH THAT IT'S GOING. TO BE. ON ON WIELDING IN ON ON DOABLE AND DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT YES I DID -- WHEN IT JUST KIND OF TOUCH UP ON WHAT SENATOR WHY BECAUSE HE SAID WHICH WAS -- BECAUSE OF THOSE MAY GET A NEGATIVE DECORATIONS AND INDIES THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO A FULL ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WHICH MEANS NOW YOU'RE WE NOW YOU'RE BASICALLY TELLING COURTS TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO A FULL ENVIRONMENT A PROCESS IN. SINCE IT'S THE COURT OF APPEALS SUPERIOR COURT AD SUPREME COURT WHAT THREE MONTHS TIME. ESSENTIALLY LIKE IN CASE THAT LIKE WITH THE PILLS ON IT AND I HAVE ADMITTEDLY ONLY PRACTICE FOR A YEAR BUT I FOR A ONLY NOW I KNOW FOR A FACT. THAT ONE CASE THAT I GOT ON THE SECOND DAY THAT I STARTED PRACTICING WAS NOT FINISHED THE YEAR THAT I WAS I DECIDED TO COME TO SIERRA CLUB. AND SO I JUST DON'T SEE EIGHT AND THAT WAS ONLY IN THE TRIAL COURT AND SO I JUST DON'T SEE THE FEASIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ARE WE GOING TO WRAP IT UP VERY QUICKLY JUST VERY BRIEFLY CENTER ALLEN VERY BRIEFLY CYNICISM IN THE TEARS YOU KNOW LIKE -- YOU KNOW I IF YOU KNOW IF IF THIS BILL GETS I MEAN CLEAR THIS IS SOME OF THE PEOPLE STRUGGLE AS I I DO THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOUSING. ON THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION WAS LIEU NEARING IT HOUSING IN TRANSIT -- YEAH THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD -- IF YOU KNOW. YEAH I'M I'M ON THE SUPPORTED TODAY I WORKED REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE DURING ANY Q. -- BUT BUT I I I WOULD I WOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER THAT IN THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY IN ASSUMING AT THIS BILL IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CHALLENGES. AT VARIOUS STAGES IN THE PROCESS BUT BUT THAT WOULD REALLY CN ZERO IN THE DISCUSSION INTO TWO AREAS ARE WE REALLY KNOW WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. I STILL THINK WOULD MAKE ME WOULD DO BIG WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR FOLKS AROUND THE STATE. STE HI SO -- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO CONSIDER. SO YOU WANT ME TO CLOSE NO I AND WE WE HAVE SENATOR -- BORDERS HAVE ONE LIMITATION ECONOMY JUST SAY THAT THE OFFER IS I UNDERSTOOD IT WAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION. AND AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE CHALLENGE WITH. WITH. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN -- OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONLY IN OPPORTUNITY ZONES IS IT THESE ARE ARE POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS -- IF YOU THINK WELL LET ME JUST PUT IT IN A POSITIVE. TO ONLY POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS. IS OFFENSIVE TO ME FRANKLY AND QUITE RIGHTEOUSLY WOULD BRING DOWN THE WRATH OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT STOOD UP AND DIDN'T LIKE IT THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THAT IS OVER CONCENTRATION OF POVERTY AND SO THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS. THE PROBLEM THAT RURAL CALIFORNIA HAS -- WITH HOW WE FIND TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IS THAT. WE HAVEN'T PRIORITIZED. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FROM OUR BIGGER CITIES INTO RURAL-CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE TRAIN OR TO TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION HOME. AND SENATOR MONEY KNOWS THAT BECAUSE I USED TO HITCH A RIDE WITH HIM. TO GET BACK HOME AND AND I DO REGULARLY BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO NOT DRIVE MYSELF AND SO IT IT JUST DIDN'T WORK -- AND SO WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. I APPRECIATE THE OFFERS THAT WERE MADE BUT BUT FRANKLY THIS IS THIS IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE THAT AND AND I EAT MY COMMITMENT IS AT ALL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ALL CONTINUE. TO TO TO NARROW IT IN TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW IT CAN BE BETTER BECAUSE IN THE END I WANTED TO WORK AND I WANTED TO BE TO BE A TOOL THAT WE CAN USE ALL OVER THE STATE. THANK YOU ARE DID YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING CENTER BORDERS FOR QUICKLY AS FOR THE LAST FEW WORDS -- WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD BECAUSE THAT WE BELIEVE IN YOUR WORD AND YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH -- THE FOLKS IN THIS PROCESS. IT WILL PROBABLY CHANGE BUT I THINK IF WE BELIEVE IN THE END GOAL YEAH I THINK WE DO SHARE THIS. THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE THE EFFORT SO -- WITH THAT -- MOVED THE BILL. THANK YOU I'M NOT SURE WHO WE IS BUT SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR DISCUSSION AND I I AM. WAITED THAT YOU ARE A FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD AND I SUSPECT THEY'LL BE MANY MORE -- IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE FEEL FREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT DISCUSSION -- THIS IS THIS IS CAN IF I CAN SAY WHY I REALLY LIKE THE SENATE BECAUSE THERE IS THERE ARE. REALLY GOOD POLICY -- DISCUSSIONS I THINK THE THE WITH -- WITH ALL THREE DUE RESPECT TO THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY THE PROJECT WAS DELAYED OVER SIXTEEN MONTHS AND TIME IS MONEY AND CARING COSTS BECOME INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT -- AND SO I I I REALLY APPRECIATE THEM BEING ON ON THE SIDE OF GOODNESS AND LIGHT HERE TODAY -- BUT I I ALSO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BILL I A FILE THIS BILL ON THE FIRST DAY THAT WE GOT SWORN IN -- IN DECEMBER AND SO THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT I AND AND I YOU KNOW. WHAT WORKED REALLY HARD WITH SENATOR ALLEN -- TO TO TO MAKE IT THE BEST IT COULD BE AND I I'M REAL PROUD OF A FOR IT IS RIGHT NOW NO QUESTION THAT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE -- TO NEED SOME REFINEMENT AND SO IF YOU'VE GOT IDEAS AND CONCEPTS THAT YOU THINK I HAD IT PUT INTO IT I'M I'M MORE I HAVE AN OPEN DOOR AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT THE TRUST.

AND WHO IS LICENSED IN THE STATE. THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE POSTED UNDER THIS BILL IS PUBLIC INFORMATION UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. THE BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT COULD NOT BE OBTAINED THROUGH A PUBLIC READ RECORDS REQUEST AND THE BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE AVERAGE CITIZEN MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECEIVE. THE AFOREMENTIONED INFORMATION TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST WE KNOW LICENSING AUTHORITIES CURRENTLY PROVIDE SIMILAR INFORMATION AS REQUIRED IN SB FIVE EIGHTY ONE FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES FOR EXAMPLE THE ALCOHOL BEVERLY BEVERAGE CONTROL.

GOOD GOOD EVENING CENTER WHY COUNTY EVENING WE STARTING WITH ITEM NINETEEN SENATE BILL FIVE EIGHTEEN YES. WHEN I JUST HOLD ON HALF A SECOND SOME? MOTION OUT THE DOORS. OKAY I THINK WE'RE GOOD TO GO SO. THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO HELP US UP HOLD THIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA TO INSPECT -- PUBLIC RECORDS NOW THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT ALLOWS ALL CALIFORNIANS TO INSPECT ALMOST ANY PUBLIC RECORD HELD BY A STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY. OF AN AGENCY IMPROPERLY WITHHOLDS RECORDS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN SEE COURT ORDER TO ENFORCE THE RIGHTS INSPECTORATE KURDS. NOW THE THE C. P. R. A. B. MANDATES TO THE COURT A WAR COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES TO REQUEST -- AS LONG AS THE COURT FINDS THAT THE REQUESTED CASES NOT FRIVOLOUS UNFORTUNATELY PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE USING NINE NINE EIGHT OFFERS TO PREVENT THE RELEASE OF DISCLOSE PULL DOCUMENTS. AND TO SHIFT THE COURT COSTS ON TO THE REQUESTOR DIRECTLY UNDERMINING THE C. P. R. A THE STAFF REPORT DOES A GOOD JOB IN SHOWING THAT. NINE NINE EIGHT OFFERS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN GETTING PARTIES TO SETTLE IN CERTAIN CASES BUT THEY'VE GOT NO PLACE IN THE IN THE C. P. R. A. CASES. SB FIVE EIGHTEEN ULTIMATELY ENSURES THAT THE CPR IS BEING USED AS IT WAS INTENDED AS A WAY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT THE FEAR BEING BURDENED BY COURT FEES. AND WITH ME HERE IS JIM. HE WORKED IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND WHEN I CALL JEEZ -- ON WHAT WE HAVE TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES. JUST ONE WITNESS EXCELLENT OF% PLEASE PROCEED TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- JIM YOU WERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION -- AS THE SENATOR POINTED OUT -- THESE NINE NINE EIGHT MOTIONS ARE BEING USED -- TO COERCE REQUESTERS. INTO -- BARGAINING AWAY THE RIGHTS THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION. AND IT'S UNDER THE THREAT OF LOSING THEIR OR ATTORNEYS FEES OR AT LEAST DIMINISHING THE ATTORNEY'S FEES WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY ENFOCEMENT MECHANISM IN THE ACT RIGHT NOW. ALL OF THE REQUEST FOR HAS WHEN THEY'RE DEALING WITH -- A VERY POWERFUL AGENCY AND AND ITS ATTORNEYS FEES AND HELP. LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD -- WHEN DEALING WITH THIS UNEQUAL BARGAINING POSITION? AND BY PROHIBITING THIS PRACTICE SB FIVE EIGHTEEN HELPS GUARD AGAINST THE EROSION OF THIS -- ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM AND FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. YOU OF OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT VERY CLEAR SHE HAN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. DO YOU REMEMBER THE LAW OFFICE OF THE JEFF FOR MALES BUT I MITCHELL HERE -- INDIVIDUALLY PERSONALLY IN SUPPORT. VERY GOOD WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TWO MINUTES EACH GOOD EVENING. GOOD AFTERNOON HOUSE GOING TO SAY BUT YEAH GOOD EVENING. THAT'S WHAT RIGHT EXACTLY WE'RE ALMOST THERE. JEFF NEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. IN OPPOSITION I WANT. TO MENTION AN EXAMPLE OF A CASE THAT CURRENTLY PENDING IN -- SUPERIOR COURT THAT I THINK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHY. NINE EIGHT ELEMENT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN P. R. A. CASES THE GREEN HILLS RANCH VERSUS FOX GAINING GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AGENCY AND IN THIS CASE -- THE REQUEST WENT TO A FAIRLY SMALL WATER GENCY BY A SERIAL REQUEST THROUGH SENDS NUMEROUS P. R. A. REQUESTS AS THEIR ALLOWED TO DO IN THE VOLUME OF THE P. R. A REQUEST FROM THE REQUEST -- THE PUBLIC AGENCY OVERLOOKED THIS ONE AND SO THEN THE REQUEST -- FOLLOWED UP WITH A LAWSUIT AS THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO ONCE SERVED WITH THE LAWSUIT THE AGENCY IMMEDIATELY MADE ALL OF THE RECORDS THAT WERE REQUESTED AVAILABLE WITH NO EXEMPTIONS ASSERTED. BUT THE SERIAL REQUEST OR IS NOW SEEKING DISCOVERY IN THE LITIGATION TO PURPOSELY DRAW IT OUT DRIVING UP COSTS AND FEES. DESPITE HAVING RECEIVED ALL OF THE RECORDS THAT WERE REQUESTED IN ANOTHER CASE IN THE ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT THE COUNTY DISCOVERED AT THE OUTSET OF THE P. R. A LOOK BACK CASE THAT CERTAIN RECORD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED. THE COUNTY WANTED TO PRODUCE THEM AND THEN ISOLATE THE RECORDS THAT WERE ACTUALLY -- IN DISPUTE THEY OFFERED TO NINE NINE EIGHT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH WAS RELUCTANTLY ACCEPTED AND THEN IN THE END. THE COURT RULED IN THE REQUEST HERS FAVOR ANYWAY ON SOME OF THE DISPUTED CATEGORY SO -- THE ATTORNEY GOT THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES AT RESPECTIVE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NINE NINE EIGHT WHICH IS EXACTLY WE THINK HOW THE NINE NINE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SHOULD ACT AND IF THEY HAD NOT PREVAILED ON THOSE DISPUTED CATEGORIES. THEY WOULDN'T OF HAD TO COVER THE LOCAL AGENCIES FEES -- NO ONE WAS CHARGING THAT THIS WAS FRIVOLOUS FOR THEM TO PURSUE IT -- IT WOULD JUST LIMIT THE LOCAL AGENCIES COSTS THIS DOESN'T SHIP BECAUSE SUCH AS LIMITS LOCAL AGENCIES COST. THEN THE OTHER POINT WE WANT TO PUSH BACK ON IS THAT THE NOTION THAT NINE NINE EIGHT SHOULDN'T APPLY IN P. R. A. CASES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LIKE OTHER TYPES OF CIVIL LITIGATION. THERE WAS A CASE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN CITY OF LOS ANGELES VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT ANDERSON BARKER. WHERE WE IN FACT ARGUED THAT P. R. A. CASES SHOULD BE GOVERNED ONLY BY THE GOVERNMENT CODE PR A PROVISIONS FOR PROCESSES IN RICK REMEDIES -- BUT BUT WE LOST THAT CASE AND SO IT SEEMS PATENTLY UNFAIR. FOR AT TO ONLY APPLY THE THE BURDEN SOME PARTS WITHOUT THE BENEFITS OF CIVIL LITIGATION AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS -- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEALING GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. OF AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IT -- IT REMOVES AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES TO WRAP POTENTIALLY REDUCE THEIR LITIGATION COSTS. RELATED TO THE CV ARE A LAWSUIT -- THESE ARE RARELY RARELY USE -- AFFECTED IT CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF SEATS -- PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST THAT WE RECEIVE -- THE THE LAWSUITS ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY RARE -- IT MADE IT IN GENERAL -- THE NINE ANY AS A TOOL TO PREVENT -- SERIAL LITIGANTS FROM IT UTILIZING THIS EPRA TO PROFIT. FROM SUING PUBLIC AGENCIES AT THE EXPENSE OF TAXPAYING PUBLIC. IT MIGHT BE THE THE SERIAL AGAINST THEY CAN -- THEY COULD MAKE REQUESTS FOR ANY AMOUNT OF RECORDS THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO MODIFY THEIR REQUEST FOR THE PUBLIC AGENCY A PUBLIC AGENCY WE'LL TRY WE'LL TRY TO WORK WITH THESE REQUESTERS BUT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THESE REQUESTS YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE. FROM CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE RECORDS TO ANYBODY WHO S. IN AND IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIVING THE NILE SOMEBODY CAN FILE A LAWSUIT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRY AND WORK WITH US TO TRY AND GET THE RECORDS. FOLKS ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH US TO GET RECORDS IN THERE'S A GENUINE DISPUTE -- THAT'S NOT WHERE THESE -- NINE NINE EIGHT OFFERS ARE BEING MADE IT'S IT'S WHERE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THE THE THE SERIAL LITIGATION. AND HAVING THAT. JUST HAVING THAT TOOL IN THE TOOL BELT I THINK HELPS PREVENT THAT LITIGATION TO ONE OF OUR FARS IS IF THIS TOOL IS. REMOVED THAT WE MAY SEE MORE SERIALIZATION WE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE FACT WE CAN'T PREDICT HOW -- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT ATTORNEYS MIGHT REACT TO THIS BUT WE WE ARE FEARFUL THAT THE REMOVING OF THAT TOOL WILL RESULT IN A MORE LITIGATION INCREASED COSTS REPUBLIC AGENCIES IN RESPONSE. TO THESE VERY RARE CASES WHERE WE EXERT THESE -- THIS TOOL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING AB MEMBERS SAID JASON BRYANT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE POSTED BILL THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING CARE ACROSS THE BEHALF OF DOWNTOWN CENTER BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS ROTH OPPOSED THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OR LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST HOPING YOU COULD RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE ASIAN RISK -- AND ALSO THE AN APPLICABILITY -- IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT -- BUT WE'RE JUST HEARING OF THE SERIAL LEADING LITIGATION SITE I GUESS MY FIRST CHANCE MY FIRST RESPONSE IS THAT YOU KNOW THESE NINE NINE EIGHT OFFERS TO BE MADE. BEFORE LITIGATION COMES IN WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR PUBLIC RECORDS AND WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN WE OFTEN THAT WE HAVEN'T GONE TO THE LAWSUIT. YES WHICH IS I WANT THE PUBLIC RECORDS IN THE SAME WILL WILL SETTLE THAT THEY DON'T GET THE INFORMATION WE DON'T KNOW HOW SOMEBODY MAKES MONEY AT A GIVING. PUBLIC DOCUMENTS BUT MAYBE THEY DO -- YOU KNOW I EIGHT EIGHT OUNCE. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY UNFAIR BUT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE DEMOCRACY THAT WE LIVE IN IS PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO THESE THIS INFORMATION. YOU KNOW I'M NOT I'M I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL -- IN AN RULES OF PROCEDURE BEING MOVED BEING USE THIS IN THE IN A WAY THAT -- CURBS PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DOING MAN. I JUST. I GUESS MY MY CONCERT. ANYONE IS IN A WAY TRANSPARENCY. COM SO IT'S AN AWKWARD SPOT TO SAY CONCERNS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IN THEORY ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY BUT AND JUST TALKING A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE MAN OF PR A REQUEST THAT THESE FOR ME THEY SPEND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH OF THEIR TIME DEALING WITH. QUEST AFTER REQUEST OF COURSE AND JUST HIRING ATTORNEYS AND I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IF IT FROM STATE AGENCIES I HEAR IT. SO I JUST I WANT SOME ASSURANCE OR OR THESE NSIGHT FROM YOU ALL THAT. THIS ISN'T GOING. TO JUST OPEN UP SORT OF I I FORGET FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION EVEN JUST. ARE A REQUEST THAT THAT AREN'T REALLY. LEGITIMATE IN NATURE KNOWING THAT THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS THIS SORT OF EXIT BECAUSE I AM YEAH I I YOU JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HOW DOES? WERE YOU THAT I MEAN TELL ME OUT YET OR FEEL FREE TO SHOOT ME DOWN TO I JUST. AUBURN TIGERS SHOULD YOU DOWN BUT I I THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON LITIGATION -- STOPPING LITIGATION I MEAN THAT'S GOING TO COME BECAUSE OF THE AGENCY'S. ACTION OR INACTION BASED ON THE REQUEST THIS IS SIMPLY WHAT HAPPENS DURING. THAT PROCESS WHEN THEY ARE IN LITIGATION AND THEN THE NINE ANY MOTION COMES FROM. THE AGENCY TO TRY TO COERCE THE REQUEST -- INTO ACCEPTING LESS THAN THE REQUEST WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO AND GENERALLY THESE RECORDS ARE ALREADY -- COMING TOWARD THE REQUEST OR AS A RESULT OF THE LITIGATION WHERE THE AGENCY RESISTED -- THE REQUEST UP TO THAT POINT AND FORCED THE REQUEST -- TO GO TO COURT TO GET THE DOCUMENTS NOW THEY'RE BEING COERCED AND BY THE THREAT OF THIS NINE NINE EIGHT MOTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE A LESSON IN THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES. THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE THEY PREVAILED -- THAT'S IT'S NEFARIOUS REALLY SO THIS IS GOING TO CUT IT THIS ISN'T GOING TO HELP CUT DOWN -- OR IT'S NOT GOING TO XCELERATED LITIGATION IT WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THAT WHATSOEVER THIS JUST IMPACTS WHEN LITIGATION IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. AND I GUESS YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE SETTLEMENT OFFERS YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE NINE NINE A SETTLEMENT OFFER SON AND UNDER THIS. LEGISLATION THAT'S THAT'S THE NARROWNESS OF IT. OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR ALLEN. AND YOUR WITH THE COUNTIES. OKAY YOU YOU WERE JUST FINISHING YOUR YOUR STATEMENT I AND YOU KNOW I I WAS INTERESTED JUST HEARING YOUR YOUR FINAL THOUGHTS IT IS IT IS ONLY HALF A SENTENCE THAT OKAY OKAY OKAY JUST THAT -- IT IN THIS IN THIS COURT CASE. WE WERE VERY PUBLIC AGENCIES WERE -- LOST THE CASE THAT THERE BECAUSE THE COURT FOUND THAT THE CIVIL DISCOVERY ACT APPLIES TO BE ARE A CASES WE'RE SAYING THAT -- THE PROCESS AND REMEDY SHOULD BE ONLY UNDER THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE P. R. EIGHT COAT AND SO -- WE LOST THAT CASE AND SO WE FEEL LIKE -- IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO ONLY APPLY THE BURDENSOME ASPECTS OF CIVIL LITIGATION IF INDEED IF INDEED ARE A REQUEST. LITIGATION IS CIVIL LITIGATION -- WE HAVE THE BURDEN SOME ASPECTS BUT NOT THE BENEFICIAL ASPECTS LIKE NINE NINE EIGHT SO IF TO PAY IF YOU LOSE BUT YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING IF YOU IN. AT THAT WOULD YEAH WELL I MEAN WE WE DON'T GET ANY. AT ANY TIME UNDER P. R. A REQUEST UNLESS IT'S FRIVOLOUS AND THAT'S THE I MEAN THAT ALMOST RIGHT NEVER HAPPENED THAT'S FINE -- THIS IS JUST A CASE OF WHETHER WE HAVE TO PAY UP TO THE NINE NINE EIGHT OR WHETHER WE WHEN WE HAVE MADE OF AREASONABLE YOU KNOW ITS -- NO WE WE DO WE DO SHOULD WE SHOULD HAVE THESE RECORDS WOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT -- AND THESE ARE BUT THESE ARE STILL PRIVILEGE THESE HAVE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION -- PERHAPS OF EMPLOYEES OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER WHATEVER OTHER EXCEPTIONS THERE ARE TO THE P. R. A. -- AND IF THEY GO TO COURT TO GET THOSE IF IF IN FACT THEY WERE INCORRECT AND THEY'RE NOT. ARE ABLE THEN AT THAT POINT WHY SHOULD WE PAY FOR THEIR LITIGATION AFTER WE ALREADY GAVE THEM ALL THE RECORDS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT'S A GOOD POINT WHAT. WILL THE COURT DECIDES MADAM CHAIR PLEASE THROUGH THE COURT DECIDED THE REQUESTER PREVAILS WHETHER THEIR COSTS IN THEIR FEES ARE ARE ARE. I PAID IT WITH WHAT THIS DOES IS NINE NINE EIGHT USING YOU MUST REWARDED OF THIS. RIGHT THE PARTIES YOU KNOW PARTIES CAN STILL SETTLE WITHOUT THE NINE NINE EIGHT TO NINE NINE EIGHT TRIGGERS THIS THIS RESPONSIBILITY ON TO THE REQUESTOR THAT NORMALLY IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS WORLD WE DON'T DO THAT. THAT'S YOU KNOW THE JUDGE THE JUDGE. THE JUDGE WILL MAKE HER DECISION YOU KNOW ON THE REQUEST AS YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND IF IT'S PRIVILEGE WON'T GET IN THAT ALL GETS IRONED OUT. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE. CENTER Y. KOWSKI YOU MAY CLOSE TONIGHT VOTE. ALREADY THE MOTION IS. TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS.

KOWSKI AND I BELIEVE. YOU HAVE ONE OTHER ITEM FILE ITEM. TWENTY EIGHT SB. SEVEN OH SEVEN THE ARBITRATION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN FIRST OFF MADAM CHAIR I ACCEPTED MA'AM IN SOME PAGE ELEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR IMPROVING THE BILL WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS SEVEN SB SEVEN OH SEVEN PROVIDES A CRUCIAL PROCESS FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS -- TO USE WHEN THEY FIRST -- WHEN THEIR FIRST BEEN FORCED OUT OF COURT AND IF IT AND THEY'VE ALSO BEEN DENIED ANY RECOURSE IN ARBITRATION? MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS ARE EVERYWHERE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL BILLS IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THEN ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE OVER HALF OF THE AMERICANS WORKFORCE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SIGN MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AS A CONDITION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. WITH WORKERS AND CONSUMERS BARRED FROM GOING DIRECTLY TO THE COURTS BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO STRATEGICALLY WITH FULL PAYMENT TO OBSTRUCT PROCEEDING IN THE ABILITY TO PURSUE THE CLAIM. SB SEVEN OH SEVEN SIMPLY LAYS OUT THE PROCESS AND PENALTIES FOR THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR THE BILL ALSO ADDS THE SAME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF ARBITRATE. ARBITRATORS -- DEMOGRAPHICS IS IF. AS IS ALREADY REPORTED ON OUR JUDICIAL BENCH GIVES US SOME IDEA OF WHO'S GOING WHO'S USING THE SERVICE WITH ME I HAVE TO PRESENT OF THE OF THE CONSUMER -- ATTORNEYS MIKE AREAS AND NO -- LIP WHAT'S INTERNING WITH THE EMPLOYMENT. LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING TWO MINUTES EACH IF YOU WOULD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NO A LEVEL IT'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. THIS BILL ADDRESSES ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS PRACTICES WE ARE NOW STARTING TO SEE. MORE AND MORE OFTEN. WHEN WORKERS ARE FORCING TO ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE THEIR EMPLOYMENT DISPUTES? AS IT STANDS THE CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE TO POP THE TWO PARTIES OR ARBITRATORS AS TO WHAT TO DO WHEN PARTY FORCING AN EMPLOYEE AN ARBITRATION. FAILS TO PAY THE REQUIRED FEES TO PROVIDE THE VENUE FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO VINDICATE THEIR ON WEARABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS. OVER THE YEARS WE AT CO I HAVE SEEN INSTANCES WHERE EMPLOYERS HAVE FOR PURELY STRATEGIC REASONS. FAILED TO PAY AT THE OUTSET OR STOPPED PAYING IN THE MIDDLE OF ARBITRATION. THIS TACTIC HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMMON PLACE. IN PART BECAUSE THE OFFENDING PARTY KNOWS THE CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT PROVIDES NO REMEDY TO THE AGGRIEVED PARTIES. THE TACTIC HAS BEEN USED IN ALL TYPES OF EMPLOYMENT CASES IN IMPACTING BOTH LOW WAGE HOURLY WORKERS AND HIGH PAID EXECUTIVES. JUST LAST YEAR I EXPERIENCE THIS -- THIS TACTIC TWICE IN THE SAME CASE. THE CASE WAS SIMPLE AND EXECUTIVE SUING FOR BREACH OF WRITTEN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT. WE WERE REQUIRED TO BRING THE CASE AN ARBITRATION BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S PRE DISPUTE FORCED ARBITRATION CONTRACT IT REQUIRED MY CLIENT TO SIGN AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. IN MY CASE THE COMPANY DELAYED PAYING AT THE IN ITS INITIATION FEE WITH JAMS. BECAUSE IT DID NOT WANT MY CLIENT TO BE ABLE TO GET ANY DISCOVERY BEFORE A MEDIATION THAT THE PARTIES HAD ALREADY SET. WHEN THE CASE DID NOT RESOLVE THE MEDIATION THEY PAID THE FEE AND -- JAM SET AN INITIAL STATUS CONFERENCE JAMS AS A POLICY THAT UNTIL BOTH PARTIES PAVE THE INITIATION FEE THEY WILL NOT EVEN INITIATE THE CASE TO PROVIDE INITIAL STATUS CONFERENCE. WHEN THE CASE EXCUSE ME SEVEN MONTHS LATER? WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF OUR HEARING IN OTHER WORDS A TRIAL. THE COMPANY ASK THE ARBITRATOR FOR CONTINUANCE OF THE HEARING AND THE HEARING DATE THE ARBITRATOR DENIED THE REQUEST. THEN THE COMPANY FAILED TO PAY THE DEPOSIT REQUIRED BY JAMS TO COVER THE ARBITRATOR'S FEE FOR THE HEARING. THE ARBITRATOR'S RESPONSE. EVERYTHING'S OFF CALENDAR I CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL I GET PAID. I FILED A MOTION FOR DEFAULT CLAIMING A BREACH OF FOR A CLEANING BAD FAITH AND PREJUDICE MY CLIENT HAD TO PAY THE NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE ARBITRATOR TO EVEN GET THE HEARING ON MY MOTION. THE ARBITRATOR THEN DENIED MY MOTION PRIMARILY ON THE GROUND THAT THE ARBITRATOR CALIFORNIA WHICH ASIAN AT ONE DID NOT HAVE ANY PROVISION FOR DEFAULT AND TWO DID HAVE A PROVISION THAT ANY AWARD MADE WITHOUT ALLOWING A PARTY TO PRESENT EVIDENCE WOULD BE VACATED BY THE COURT. UNDER CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE TWELVE EIGHTY SIX POINT TWO SUBSECTION A FIVE WHEN MY MOTION WAS PENDING THE COMPANY PAID THE FEE. AND THE ARBITRATOR ALLOWED THE COMPANY CONTINUE IN THE ARBITRATION IN THE END THE COMPANY GOT EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTED A CONTINUATION OF THE HEARING DATE. THIS TACTIC PRESENTLY IS BEING EMPLOYED BY COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND LIFT. RIGHT NOW OVER IS FACING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION CLAIMS BY MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. IN FACT THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED THEIR THEIR ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COURT AND FAILED TO PAY THEIR FEES. DESPITE FORCING EVERYBODY'S IN THE ARBITRATION RESPECTIVELY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THANK GAVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA TIME. WE'LL DO THAT ON THE OTHER END IF IF NEED BE BUT TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OF GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS MIKE AREAS I AM THE PRESIDENT THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA MOST OF MANAGING PARTNER OF MY FOR MAYOR SANGUINETTI WING AT TRIOS -- CO SEE IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF OF THIS. AS SB -- SEVEN OH SEVEN AS YOU'VE HEARD AND SEEN IN RECENT YEARS -- THERE'S BEEN A SURGE OF OF ARBITRATION. AND FORCED ARBITRATION CLAUSES ARE AND EVERYTHING THEY WERE TOUCHING TODAY FROM CONSUMER CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS. AND IT IS AS WE'VE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES IT HAS LIMITED THE ABILITYIN RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYEES. TWO OF THEM HAVE THEIR RIGHTS VINDICATED. IT'S BEEN LIMITATION ITS LIMITATIONS ARE AND THEN WE'LL DISCUSS I WILL GO INTO A LOT OF THAT. WE ALSO KNOW -- THAT WITHOUT THAT PICKED I BELIEVE WITHOUT THE PROTECTIONS OF SB -- SEVEN SEVEN THESE COMPANIES AS JUST WAS TESTIFIED TO WILL CONTINUE. TO DENY THE RIGHTS -- THAT -- IN MY VIEW ARBITRATION ALREADY DOES BY SIMPLY ALLOWING OUR THESE -- DEFENDANTS WHETHER TO CORPORATION A BUSINESS OR WHOEVER TO SIMPLY -- DELAY BY THE JUSTICE THAT. I BELIEVE THAT YOU STILL REALLY DON'T HAVE AN ARBITRATION BUT THE LIGHT TO DENY WHATEVER JUST AS AN ARBITRATION ALLOWS YOU. TO CHOOSE -- OCCURRENCE LONG AS IT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY FEEL THEY WANT TO TRY TO PROVIDE SOME ARBITRATE SOME -- JUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS -- THIS IS A DISCOURAGING PROCESS ARBITRATION OF ITSELF -- IS A DISCOURAGING PROCESS IS UNFAIR IT'S ONE SIDED BUT IT'S EVEN MORE INSULTING THAT WHEN YOU FOR SAY AN EMPLOYER CONSUMER INTO THAT. THAT YOU TURN AROUND AND JUST SIDE WANTED LATE EVEN LONGER BY SIMPLY NOT PAYING FEES. SIMPLY NOT COMPLY WITH THE PROCESS THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE ARBITRATION WHICH IS THE ARBORS PROCESS THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN FOR THE EMPLOYEE OR THE THE CONSUMER -- IF YOU'RE GONNA PROVIDE ANY JUST I DON'T BELIEVE ARBITRATION VICE MUCH JUSTICE ANYWAY BUT THE THE LITTLE. ABOUT A JUST AS IT DOES PROVIDE OF IS IS GONNA BE LOST IF YOU DO NOT -- AND ACTORS THIS -- SB SEVEN SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. REYES BEEN WAITING. MAKE YOU WAIT ALL DAY. THEN I WILL GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES AND FORTY SECONDS TO EQUALIZE THAT TESTIMONY ALTHOUGH I KNOW YOU CAN TALK VERY FAST AND DO IT UNDER TWO MINUTES. GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BURR ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED SB SEVEN OF SEVEN I DON'T KNOW THE THE SPECIFICS OF THE CASES THAT THEY MENTIONED ARE THE COMPANIES WITH REGARD STARBIRD RATIONS. AND I'M NOT SITTING HERE UP HERE TO DEFEND WHEN A COMPANY INTENTIONALLY ENGAGES IN FAILURE TO PAY IN ORDER TO GAIN SOME STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IN ARBITRATION. SUCH AS NOT PROVIDING A VENUE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THAT'S NOT -- SOMETHING THAT I'M GONNA SIT HERE AND TRY TO DEFEND BUT I THINK THE BROAD AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS OVERLY BROAD AND WILL INCLUDE. POTENTIAL CASES IN WHICH THERE'S A VALID FEW DISPUTE WITH REGARDS TO THE ARBITRATION COSTS AND FEES DO YOU AND IF. A COMPANY DOESN'T PAY EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A BALLOT FEW DISPUTE -- THERE'S A HOST OF PUNISHMENTS THAT THEN COME INTO PLAY IMMEDIATELY -- FOR FAILURE TO PAY FOR EXAMPLE -- THE BILL CURRENTLY DRAFTED SAYS THAT THEY CAN FILE ANY CLAIMS IN COURT THAT THEY COULD HAVE FILED BUT DIDN'T FILE AN ARBITRATION THAT'S A CONCERN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BARRED BY THE STATURE LIMITATIONS IN ARBITRATION OR THE SUCH ARE THEY DIDN'T PHYLUM AN ARBITRATION AND NOW IT'S BARRED. THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE REVIVED IN COURT -- THERE'S ALSO A LIST OF MONETARY DAMAGES OF COURSE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL BE ENTITLED -- TO FOR ARBITRATION COSTS ATTORNEYS USING AT THE ANY OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ARBITRATION AND MOVING THAT CASE FROM ARBITRATION TO COURT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY ALSO -- HAVE A LIST OF SANCTIONS THAT THE COURT AND THE JUDGE WOULD BE. NOT THEY DON'T HAVE THE DISCRETION NOT TO ISSUE IT IS H. THEY SHALL ISSUE INCLUDING MONETARY PENALTIES ON TOP OF THE DAMAGES -- BUT THEY'VE ALREADY HAD TO PAY FOR THE COST OF ARBITRATION EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS WHERE THEY WOULD BE BARRED FROM DOING ANY DISCOVERY IN CIVIL COURT -- STRIKING OF THE PLEADINGS -- TERMINATING SANCTIONS WHERE THEY WOULD BASICALLY THE JUDGE COULD ISSUE A DEFAULT JUDGMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY ALL BECAUSE THERE IS A VALID GOOD FAITH DISPUTE IN THE BEGINNING AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE ARBITRATION FOR YOUR COSTS TO BE PAID OR LET'S SAY THAT IN IN THE CASE THAT THE COMPANY. HAD PAID THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR ARBITRATION THERE SOME NOMINAL AMOUNT THAT THE BRICK PAID AGAIN IT DOESN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT AND SOMEBODY WHO STRATEGICALLY INTENTIONALLY NOT PAYING AN ARBITRATION IN ORDER TO AVOID HAVING A VENUE RESOLVE THE DISPUTES. SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS OVERLY BROAD AND CAPS LATE THINGS IN WHICH THERE COULD BE A GOOD FAITH DISPUTE. AND NOT HAVING THE PAYMENT OF A ARBITRATION COSTS AND FEES BUT NONE THE LESS WOULD HAVE THIS LIST OF PUNITIVE ODD. PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS ISSUED AGAINST THE COMPANY WE HAVE -- RAISE THESE ISSUES WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- HE HAS INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO TALK WITH US ABOUT TRAINED REFINED SOMEBODY'S PROVISIONS AND SO FOR WITH THAT -- WE ARE OPPOSED RIGHT NOW BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO WORK FROM THESE ISSUES OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO TWO MINUTES TWENTY THROUGH SECONDS SO YOU STILL HAVE EIGHTEEN SECONDS IF YOU'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING FURTHER. ALL RIGHTY -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS SENATOR MONNING -- I'M SORRY COME ON UP. THIS -- VOICE RISEN CALIFORNIA HOUSE WITH ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU ON WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- WE SEE IN A NUMBER OF ARENAS -- THOSE WITH THE UPPER HAND ON UTILIZING THAT STRENGTHEN THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU'VE SHARED SHOW THAT BUT IN RESPONSE TO THE OPPOSITION. IF IF A PARTY TO THE AVERAGE ARBITRATION THE DRAFTING PARTY DOES PAY THEIR FEES AND COSTS RELATED TO THAT ARBITRATION. NOTHING IN THIS BILL. WOULD APPLY CORRECT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT A SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU ALSO SO MY COUNTY AND I NOTED THAT THE EXISTING LAW ONLY APPLIES TO EMPLOYMENT OR CONSUMER ARBITRATION. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT. WHILE ARBITRATION STARTED OUT AS A USEFUL TOOL TO EXPEDITE DISPUTE. RESOLUTION IT'S NOW BECOME. USE THE DIFFERENT WAYS SO MY QUESTION IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE EXPANDING THE BILL TO OTHER TYPES SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BUSINESS CONTEXT EVEN LEASING CONTEXT -- TO SENATOR MOUNTINGS POINT THE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE UPPER HAND HAVE. OF LATE BEEN USING IT -- NOT TO SEEK JUSTICE BUT TO BASICALLY ALL [inaudible] TO THE FIRST THINGS TO THE THE SMALLER ENTITY. YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT -- FOR ME TO EXPAND MY BILL IS -- WARMLY RECEIVED I'VE HAD OTHER ARBITRATION BILLS THAT HAVE NOT FARED SO WELL USUALLY THEY GET WHITTLED DOWN I WILL I'M. I WILL THINK HAVE CONSIDERED THAT I DID YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT WHY WHY. I THINK I GOT. AS I'VE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF HAVING ARBITRATION BILLS AND BACKED UP SO FAR THAN JUST THINKING OF IN CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES OR EMPLOYEES. BUT YOU MAKE A POINT BECAUSE IT IT DID START UP JUST BUSINESSES AND BUSINESSES AND ON THE THE INITIAL FEDERAL STATUTE. AND THE TRUTH IS SAID. THAT IF LITIGANTS DON'T WANT THE CASE TO PROCEED OR IF THEY FEEL THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEY JUST STOP PAYING I MEAN IT'S IT'S A IT'S OF HEAVY THUMB ON WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE A WISE BE THE SCALES OF JUSTICE. AND YOUR JAMS PEOPLE IN YOUR TRIPLE A BIG THEY WON'T WORK. NO TAKING NO LAUNDRY DAY ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY I'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN -- YOU YOU GOTTA GET A SENSE SAID THAT -- YOU'RE WINNING AND THE OTHER SIDE'S GOING TO COME UP WITH SOME. MONEY TO TO KEEP THE CASE GOING THEY DON'T AND SO YOUR STOCK. SO ARE I AGREE I THINK ON BOTH SIDES I DON'T CARE WHO'S THE WHO'S WINNING WHO'S LOSING IT IT IS A A TOOL THAT IS BEING USED TO CREATE A SERB NIP AGAIN ON FAIRNESS. IN THE PRIVATE LITIGATION PROCESS. SO I I WOULD I WOULD NOT DISAGREE BUT WE'RE HERE NOW. LET'S KEEP THE BILL AT THIS FORM AND WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT LATER BECAUSE IT'S GETTING LATE. CENTER BOARD JUST IF YOU WOULD. IT'S IF A IF A IF A A PARTY -- PAYS TO AVOID ANY OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT DOESN'T DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR ABILITY -- TO CONTEST -- THE THE FEES IS THAT CORRECT. I DON'T BELIEVE SO I THINK THAT FEATURED AS DETERMINED BY JAMS AND AND NORMALLY THE PARTIES CHOOSE THE ARBITRATION GROUP THAT THEY HAVE SO I DON'T. AND THEN THE EMPLOYER. OR THE BUSINESSES. THE THEY SET UP THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN LIVE I THINK THAT WHEN WE HEARD FROM THE REPRESENTED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I DON'T KNOW IF I'M RESETTING THIS ACCURATELY -- THE EXAMPLE IS THAT THE IF ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS ARE ONE OF THE PARTIES [inaudible] OBJECTED. AND DID NOT PAY. AND THEN ALL THESE PENALTIES WOULD ATTACH. SO THAT IS A REAL CONCERN. IS MY UNDERSTANDING. ATTENTION. IS HAD A QUESTION FOR THE CHAMBER WOULD YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO IT QUICKLY. THAT'S ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE THERE COULD BE A VALID FEW DISPUTE AT THE INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION AND IF WE DON'T PAY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS ALL THESE HORRIBLE THINGS CAN HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A VALID THE SPEED AT THE VERY BEGINNING. WHEN I'M IS WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH IS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A VALID DISPUTE IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE IRIS TAXES YOU? MANY TIMES YOU JUST SIMPLY PAY AND THEN CONTEST. BOB MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS THAT. IF IT INDEED IF ANY PAYS THEY CAN STILL IT DOESN'T DEPRIVE THEM -- OF THEIR ABILITY TO CONTEST THOSE FEES. IT'S A P. ARBITRATOR DATED THE ARBITRATOR SOMEONE IS GOING TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION. IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A LEGITIMATE DISPUTE. RIGHT I MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING THAT AWAY FROM THEM BUT IF THEY BUT WE'RE SHE CAN PAY UNDER PROTEST IS WHAT I'M GETTING AT YES [inaudible] YES. WE SOMETIMES SOMETIMES THE EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT THE EMPLOYEE CAN PAY THE EMPLOYER'S PORTION AND AND AND MOVE FORWARD IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THAT CAN BE. KIND OF A A GOOD. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- SENATOR WHITE HOUSE CAN WOULD YOU LIKE THE CLOTHES WELL I THINK THE OPPOSITION IS POINTED OUT THAT. ARBITRATION BECAUSE CLASSES CAN HAVE CONSEQUENCES MAYBE SOME THAT THEY WEREN'T ANTICIPATING BUT THEY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE -- TO HAVE A BOTH WAYS AND WE'RE HOPEFUL I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET IN AYE AYE VOTE AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MOTION BY SENATOR STERN -- MADAM SECRETARY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROACH PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HI JACKSON HI BORDERS. OR JUST AYE ALLEN. ALLEN I CABALLERO. CABALLERO AYE JONES [inaudible] MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. I UMBERG. AMERICA I Y. CASKEY. BY KELSEY AYE. ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS EIGHT VOTES A TWO ZERO IT IS. OUT. AND WE HAVE I BELIEVE JUST A FEW MORE BILLS. WE'LL START WITH SENATOR MONNING HE IS UP ALL WITH NUMBER FILE NUMBER. TWENTY SEVEN THEN WILL GO. TO SENATOR STERN WHO IS GOING TO BE. PRESENTING SB ONE ON BEHALF OF THE PRO TEM -- ATKINS AND THEN I WILL CONCLUDE WITH FILE ITEM. SIXTEEN R. S. BEFORE. NINETY THREE SO WITH THAT SENATOR MAHONING GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE FOR THE EXCELLENT ANALYSES ON ALL THIRTY TWO BILLS THAT WE'VE REVIEWED TODAY -- WITH THIS ONE SB SIX EIGHTY EIGHT I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE AN ANALYSIS. AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. CURRENTLY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ASSESS UNPAID MINIMUM AN OVERTIME WAGES THROUGH A CITATION ISSUED AGAINST AN EMPLOYER AND OTHER RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS. THE CITATIONS MAY BE PROSECUTED. TOGETHER IN A SINGLE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING WHEN THE CITATIONS ARE APPEALED. CONTRACT WAGES HOWEVER. MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ONLY THROUGH A CIVIL ACTION FILED IN SUPERIOR COURT. VIOLATIONS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PAY REQUIREMENTS ARE OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY NON PAYMENT OF CONTRACT WAGES. HOWEVER THE LABOR COMMISSIONER DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ASSESS AND PROSECUTE VIOLATIONS OF CONTRACT WAGES AND IS UNABLE TO PROSECUTE COMPANION CONTRACT WAGE. VIOLATIONS IN THE SAME ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AS MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME VIOLATIONS SB. SIX EIGHTY EIGHT GIVES THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THE AUTHORITY TO ASSESS UNPAID CONTRACTUAL WAGES THROUGH A CITATION ISSUED AGAINST AN EMPLOYER. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE PAID THEIR APPROPRIATE CONTRACTUAL WAGES. IN A TIMELY MANNER BY PERMITTING UNPAID CONTRACT WAGES TO BE COLLECTED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF CITATIONS WHEN WE REFER TO CONTRACT WAGES. CLOSER WAGES ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE. I'D RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND TO THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT. A SISTER DS LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR WAS STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND ALSO WANT TO THANK DAVID BALTAR FOR BEING HERE ASSISTANT CHIEF COUNSEL DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT HERE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER MINING GOOD EVENING MR TIAS THE FLOOR IS YOURS TWO MINUTES PLEASE -- CENTER MEMBERS AS EARLY AS WE HAVE A STABLE INJURIES COUNCIL WILL ALL BE LABOR THE POINT OUT CALIFORNIA HAS A WORLD CLASS ECONOMY SEVENTEEN MILLION PLUS -- EMPLOYEES -- HOWEVER ARE LONG AND LABOR LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS KIND HAVE NOT CUT UP. AND IT IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT OVER TIME THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DEBATED -- INCOME INEQUALITY IN THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THAT THE STATE IS LACKING WHEN I FIRST STARTED AT THE BUILDING TRADES WE HAD ABOUT TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL ASIANS TO GO OUT AND AND FORCED. ALL LABOR LAW ENFORCEMENT SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE OF DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS HOWEVER WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WITH THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT FOR A LOT OF THESE BAD ACTORS THAT EXIST. WHY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENT THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC MONEY AND SUBSIDIES ARE GOING INTO A LOT OF EMPLOYERS? WE EXPECT RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER SAID THERE'S NOT UNFAIR COMPETITION AND THAT THE GOOD EMPLOYERS ARE NOT PUT AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AGAINST THESE EMPLOYEES SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU TO PLEASE STEP FORWARD. VERY COURTEOUS HARM BY FOR THE CALIFORNIA PLAN MILLERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENINGMADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS EVENING WE DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS AND THE WOULD YOU GIVE US YOUR PHONE. SORRY LARA CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OKAY FIELD. LEEWAY HERE YOU'RE THINKING FOR TO GET OUT OKAY -- WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THOSE THOSE DO ALLEVIATE THE CONCERN REGARDING PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AND WE HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TIME WITH THE AMENDMENTS OF COURSE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK. AT THOSE AND ANALYZE THOSE BUT OVERALL ARE CONCERNED WITH THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE ENFORCEMENT BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THEMSELVES. BUT OF COURSE THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT AND HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT BECAUSE THIS PROVISION -- ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN POINT ONE DOES ALLOW FOR NOT ONLY THE PENALTIES BUT ALSO LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ON TOP OF THAT SO ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE DAMAGES -- AND OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT IF YOU'RE ALLOWING THIS FOR ANY SORT OF UNDERPAYMENT OF A CONTRACT WAGE. THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE TO EACH EMPLOYEE COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A DIFFERENT CONTRACT RATE OF PAY. THESE COULD BE FOR UNINTENTIONAL MINOR VIOLATIONS ONE SENT OFF -- WHICH AGAIN IS AND IT'S EASY TO CONFIRM AS MINIMUM WAGE SO OVERALL OUR CONCERNS IT AGAIN OR JUST THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY EXPOSED WITH THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU AND WE WOULD WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS HERE. ALL RIGHT -- SO OF ANY OTHER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. VIEW IN OPPOSITION. OKAY MAURICE RISEN CALIFORNIA HOUSE WOULD ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DíAS. THE MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI -- NO WAGE SEPTA SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED OF THIS IS STEALING FROM PEOPLE USUALLY PEOPLE OF WORK VERY HARD FOR VERY. LIMITED WAGE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL I'M SURE THAT YOU'LL. EXCUSE ME LET ME FINISH PLEASE. I'M SURE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS ANY REASONABLE CONCERNS THAT. A EXIST HERE -- BUT WE HAVE TO ROOT OUT THIS WAGE STAFFED IT REALLY FOR PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THAT. THE 99% WILL REALLY STRUGGLING THIS IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS SO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR EFFORT HERE -- IN CENTER BORCHETTA COMMON. IF SOMEONE WANTED TO CHALLENGE -- THE DECISION -- WITH A DO SO IN COURT OR IS THERE AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL. I'M GONNA DEFER TO OUR LABOR COMMISSIONER EXPERT IF THERE'S AN APPEAL TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ACCESS CENTER THAT WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT CURRENTLY IS ALREADY THE SITUATION. WITH CITATIONS THAT ARE ISSUED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER PURSUANT TO ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN POINT. ONE ON THE EMPLOYER IN THE FIRST INSTANCE HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUESTING GET. EIGHTY ARE HEARING WHERE THE MISSION OR HAS TO PROVE UP THE CASE. AFTER A HE OR A DECISION IS RENDERED BY THE HEARING OFFICER IF THE EMPLOYERS STILL IN DISAGREEMENT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO FILE A WRITTEN SUPERIOR COURT. IN GET REVIEW OF THAT DECISION ON UNDER THE LAW THEY ARE REQUIRED TO POST A BOND FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE WAGES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BUT NOT THE PENALTIES. SO IN ORDER TO PUT TO SEEK REDRESS -- IN SUPERIOR COURT THEY WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT A BOND. THAT CURRENTLY IS THE WALL HAD IS THAT YES IN SO. THIS WOULD THE BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD STILL. LAW WOULD REQUIRE THAT A BOT THAT THE BOND INCLUDE THE AMOUNT FOR ANY CONTRACT WHICH IS OVER AND ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE. ON THAT WAS FOUND TO SO IT COULD INCREMENTALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE BOND. ON FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S PERSPECTIVE IN ENFORCEMENT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS. OF FREQUENTLY THERE ARE TIMES WHERE WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE'S MINIMUM WAGE MINIMUM WITH THIS THE DIFFERENTIAL. ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE RIGHT IN SO THE WHAT WHAT WE EXPERIENCE IS THAT THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE WE ARE. ABLE TO GET THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT THERE ARE OTHER CONTRACT WAGES WHICH ARE TWO FOR EXAMPLE FOR WORKER WAS MAKING SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IN RECEIVED NO PAY FOR THAT FOR THOSE WAGES. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR THE ONLY WAY THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER COULD ENFORCE THOSE RIGHTS FOR THE EMPLOYEES WOULD BE FILING A SEPARATE ACTION. IN SUPERIOR COURT TO COLLECT THAT MONEY ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYEES SO IN ESSENCE. BY ALLOWING FOR THE CONTRACT WHICH IS TO BE COLLECTED WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IN. ONE RECEDING RATHER THAN. TO IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR. I WOULD ACTUALLY THINK THIS MIGHT BE. A PREFERRED PATH FOR EMPLOYERS AS WELL BECAUSE IT CONSOLIDATES THE CASE IT DOESN'T REMOVE THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO APPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT IF THEY FEEL THEY HAVEN'T. GOTTEN A FAIR SHAKE IN FRONT OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. BUT IT. THE DISPUTE IS AROUND THE PAYMENT OF THE SAME SET OF WAGES CURRENT LAW SAYS TO GO AFTER THAT DIFFERENTIAL. YOU GOTTA GO TO SUPERIOR COURT. I AGREE YEAH THANKS. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OF SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. OF CENTER MONNING WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I WAS GOING TO INCLUDE IN MY CLOTHES WITH I JUST. DESCRIBED ABOUT THE VALUE OF CONSOLIDATING THE SO WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK USER MOTION. MOVE BY CENTER Y.

SAVING THE BEST FOR SECOND THE LAST VERY GOOD -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I KNOW IT'S LATE. SO I WON'T -- MAKE THIS TO EXTENDED BUT IN ESSENCE. SAYS SENATE BILL ONE PROVIDES THIS STATE SOME INSURANCE POLICY. THAT. ARE ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS. THAT DEPEND ON FEDERAL REGULATORY REGIMES TO GIVE THEM ENFORCEABILITY -- IF THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS ARE ROLLED BACK AS WE'VE SEEN DOZENS AND DOZENS OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS ALREADY -- YOU WOULDN'T UNDER CUT CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY CONTINUE TO ENFORCE ITS LAWS AND UP HOLD ITS COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC. HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE'VE SEEN. AYE AYE BUT IS IT THREE YEARS IN TWO MONTHS SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT THROUGH THIS IS PRETTY TIME BUT THE UNCERTAINTY IS CREATING. IN THE MARKET PLACE -- FOR ENVIRONMENT FOR WORKERS IS SIGNIFICANT SO MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN EVENTUALLY ACHIEVE SOME CONSENSUS HERE WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY YOU STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE MEASURE BUT ACTUALLY FIND A WORK PRODUCT HERE THAT WILL. AT THE VERY LEAST. JUST PRESERVE. THE BASELINE STANDARDS AS WE HAD THEM AT THE END OF THE LAST FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION -- AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND A LITTLE MORE STABLE FUTURE FORWARD SO. WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT SUPPORT HERE -- OF THE FOR TO THEM ON THE DETAILS OF FOR THE MOMENT BUT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HALF OF THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH IF YOU WOULD. GOOD EVENING AT LESS THAN TWO MINUTES GOOD EVENING CAM DELFINO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE -- AS ALREADY HAS BEEN DESCRIBED -- IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE HAD A BETTER ROLE ON SLIDE OF ROLLBACKS IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY PROTECTIONS -- A LARGE NUMBER OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN WHICH ROLL BACKS OCCURRED WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT AND NOTICE. SB ONE IS REALLY JUST A SIMPLE FIX TO THE PROBLEM IT PUTS IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT IN A PROCESS FOR THE STATE AGENCIES TO ASSESS IF THESE CHANGES REDUCE PROTECTIONS. AND THEN DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO RESTORE THOSE LAWS PROTECTIONS WITHIN THE EXISTING REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF THAT STATE AGENCY. SO THIS JUST MEANS THAT IF CLEAN AIR RULES OR WEEKEND THE A. R. B. WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND THEN DETERMINE IF AND HOW THEY SHOULD RESTORE THOSE WEAKENED PROTECTIONS. IF CLEAN WATER RULES ARE WEEKEND THE STATE WATER BOARD WOULD DO THE SAME THING AND IF ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTIONS ARE WEEKEND WOULD BE THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND SO -- FOR THESE REASONS BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BACKSTOP FOR PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A LEADER IN PROTECTING OUR AIR WATER AND WORKER SAFETY -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AN ARCHER IE OF AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. A MANAGER MEMBERS AS ARE THE OTHER ME HOW THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN THE THANK OUR PRO TEMPORE CARRYING THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- MANY OF OUR LABOR SAFETY HEALTH AND SAFETY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE BASED ON FEDERAL STANDARDS -- WE CAN THINK OF ONE WHICH SILICA VERY SIMILAR TO ME SEVERELY ELMA. AND IF THERE'S A ROLL BACK ON THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT MORE A CASE IS ESPECIALLY AFFECTING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO SUFFER VERY SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH. SO FOR THOSE IN MANY OTHER REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF HUGE STEP FORWARD NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE MELISSA ROMERO CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ONE SEARCH ISRAEL GONZALEZ FLETCHER WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO EXPRESS THE SUPPORT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT DO WE HAVE SOMEONE AT THE TABLE WHO ALSO WANTED TO I'M SORRY I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE IS THANK YOU MAY HAVE CHARGING STATE POLL ON BEHALF OF ENERGY SEE? JUST BRIEFLY I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON TO PIECES OF SB -- ONE FIRST THE STATE THE THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW THE STATE TO ACT QUICKLY TO PUT BACK IN PLACE STATE STANDARDS. THE FEDERAL STANDARDS HAVE BEEN ROLLED BACK -- BUT THIS BUT THE BILL DOES ALLOW FOR NOTICE AND COMMENT ON STATE PROPOSALS. TO COUNTER THOSE FEDERAL ROLLBACKS -- SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE AIR BOARD DETERMINES THAT A FEDERAL ROLLBACK TRIGGER STATE ACTION TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO I MUST PROVIDE NOTICE OF THAT ACTION. ON ITS WEBSITE AND ALLOW FOR A LEAST THIRTY DAYS OF PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE ADOPTING THE MEASURE. ONLY AFTER THAT NOTICE AND COMMENT PERIODS COULD BE AGENCY ADOPT A PROPOSAL AS AN EMERGENCY MEASURE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T ANY GAP IN THE OR TO MINIMIZE ANY GAP BETWEEN THE STATE PUTTING IN PLACE SOME STANDARD TO PROTECT AGAINST THE FEDERAL BACK. AN HONEST CITIZEN TO PROVISION I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THAT. PROVISION ALSO JUST MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO BY RETAINING EXISTING SERVICE AND ENFORCEMENT RIGHTS UNDER STATE LAW. IF AND ONLY IF THOSE -- RIGHTS ARE REVOKED OR WEAKENED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY APOLOGIES AND INTO THEIR TRIUMVIRS NIKITA CRIED WITH ENERGY SEATED REGISTERING SUPPORT FOR AUTUMN ON CALIFORNIA AS SCHOOL AND LET YOU KNOW OUR DOORS THANK YOU THANK YOU.

THANK YOU. KIM JET WITH ANIMAL DEFENDERS INTERNATIONAL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE ADAM WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE WERE WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL NOT BECAUSE OF THE BILL STATED INTENT OF PRESERVING CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL REGIME. BUT HOW THE BILL IN SOME AREAS PROPOSES TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. IN THAT REGARD I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH US WE'VE BEEN WORKING -- OVER TO DIFFERENT -- SESSIONS TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT I'LL SPEAK TO TODAY -- I FOCUS MY TESTIMONY THIS EVENING ON TWO ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. FIRST WE DISAGREE WITH THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THAT THE THIRTY DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD IN SB ONE IS BROADER AND MORE SUFFICIENT. TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE APA'S DUE PROCESS AND NOTICE AND COMMENT. THE NOTICE AND COMMENT PROVIDE UNDER SB ONE AS THE POINT OF NOTED IS LIMITED ONLY TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE QUARTERLY LIST OF THE IDENTIFIED FEDERAL ROLL BACKS. BUT THE BILL TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF ELIMINATING ALL NOTICE AND COMMENT. N. O. L. REVIEW FOR THE ACTUAL PROMULGATION OF THE SUBSTANTIVE RULES WHICH ARE REALLY TH MEAT AND BONES OF ANY OF THE RULES THAT WILL BE PROPAGATED. IT THEN GOES EVEN FURTHER BY ALLOWING THE AGENCY TO DO SO UNDER EMERGENCY RULE MAKING AUTHORITY OR UNDER CHANGES WITHOUT REGULATORY A FACT WHICH ARE PROVISIONS HISTORICALLY LIMITED TO NON SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES INCLUDING GRAMMATICAL ERRORS. AND FIXES -- THEN IT FREEZES THOSE REGULATIONS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EXISTING LAW IT'S A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WITH TO NINETY DAY EXTENSIONS. WE HAVE PROPOSED REINSTATING THE APA PROCESS AS ONE OF OUR AMENDMENTS -- WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT ISSUE SECOND IN A CLOSE WITH THIS THE ADDITION OF PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION ARE CONTRARY TO THE BILL STATED INTENT. OF PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO IT CREATES A DUPLICATE OF PROCESS -- THAT IS A NECESSARY TO PRESERVE CITIZENS RIGHT TO SUE BECAUSE AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES EXISTING FEDERAL SERVICE IN PURSUIT PROVISIONS ALREADY PROVIDED CITIZENS WITH THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE STATE STANDARDS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN FEDERAL STANDARDS. INCLUDING THOSE ADOPTED UNDER SB. ONE EXISTING CITIZEN PURSUIT PROVISIONS ARE CONSISTENTLY USED BY NGOS. IT IS IN THAN OTHERS TO ENFORCE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE HIGHER THAN THE FEDERAL COUNTERPART. CREATING A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WOULD CREATE A DUAL TRACK SYSTEM WHERE FEDERAL COURTS IN CALIFORNIA AND STATE COURTS IN CALIFORNIA COULD END UP INTERPRETING THE EXACT SAME STANDARD IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE MY LAST POINT REAL QUICK. THAT WE HAVE LEFT INTO THE BILL THAT IF THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT ROLLS BACK ANY OF THE CITIZENS WHO PROVISIONS THAT SB ONE SHOULD BE ABLE THE FULL THOSE BACK IN THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TOO MANY NOEL KRAMER'S OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH -- THE AUTHOR STAFF. WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT IF TAKEN IN FULL WOULD ALLOW US TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. I'M UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THOSE YET SO I WANT TO POINT OUT SOME OF OUR SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE THE BILL AND PRINT -- PRIMARILY THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROVISION IS VERY PROBLEMATIC IT GOES -- IN OUR MIND ABOVE AND BEYOND JUST LOCKING IN PLACE -- HISTORIC PROTECTIONS AND GETS DOWN INTO VERY SPECIFIC PERMIT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF PERMITS. IT ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR WATER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT WOULD HAVE. I SINCE THIS IS THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THOUGH I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- SOME LEGAL LIABILITIES THAT SECTION ONE OF THE BILL CREATES WHICH WAS -- RECENTLY ADDED TO THE TO THE BILL. I THINK THE ANALYSIS MENTIONS I'M AN EXAMPLE OF IF INDIA WERE TO PASS A LAW BANNING THE SALE OF COW IS IN THE FUTURE THAT THAT COULD PREVENT THE SALE OF HOUSING CAL IN CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE COWS AREN'T WILDLIFE BUT I'LL GIVE A HANDFUL OF ALMOST LIMITLESS EXAMPLES ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT. THIS LANGUAGE PROVE THAT SAYS TO TRANSPORT CELL RECEIVE ACQUIRE PURCHASE ANY FISH WILDLIFE OR PLANT TAKEN POSSESS TRANSPORTERS SOLD IN VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR REGULATION OF ANY OTHER STATE. OR IN VIOLATION OF ANY FOREIGN LAW SO IT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED. SO FOR EXAMPLE LOUISIANA HAS A LAW THAT SAYS YOU CANNOT CUT TREES ON LAND WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC OR PRIVATE WITHIN FIVE FEET OF SEA LEVEL. SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT LANDOWNERS IN THE DELTA WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM CUTTING TREES AND REMOVING THEM FROM THEIR PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE SB ONE TO PASS. UP WE USE LATE SEASON GOOSE HUNTING IN CALIFORNIA TO PREVENT. CROP DAMAGE. THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED BECAUSE NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS A PROHIBITION OF HUNTING AFTER JANUARY SIX MEAN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON THANK YOU TO WERE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE IMPLICATIONS MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D COME FOR WITH NAME AND AFFILIATION. MADAM CHAIR IN THREE MILLION -- HALF THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE CALIFORNIA TO CALIFORNIA GREEN FEW DISSOCIATION ALSO THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BATH A LOSS SO ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION THE WESTERN ACT PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL. AND THE CALIFORNIA FRESH FRUIT ASSOCIATION AND VARIOUS OTHER AG ASSOCIATIONS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TO MEMORIZE ACT ALL RIGHT. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS -- IS SENATOR STERN AND OTHERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS -- THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD PERHAPS AND THEN THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. AND I THINK THE LEGAL LIABILITIES ISSUE AND SECTION ONE WHICH APPARENTLY IS SOMEONE NEW -- IF YOU COULD -- THEY'RE NOT YOUR EXPERTS CAN ALSO YEAH I'LL TELL I'LL TAKE INITIAL CRACK AT AND THEN PASS IT OVER BUT I I'D I THINK THE THE CONCERN ABOUT COMMENT PERIOD. IS SOMETHING THAT WE TRY TO PUT IN THE BILL TO RESPOND TO THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE TIMING OF ACTUALLY INPUT IMPLEMENTING THIS STUFF AND SO O GIVE SOME LEAD TIME TO INDUSTRY AND OTHERS HAVE TO COMPLY WE WE THOUGHT THE THE QUARTERLY. REPORT WITH THAT THAT PERIOD OF SORT OF DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY IN ABILITY REVIEW ACTION BE USEFUL -- AND THE UNDERLYING PREMISE THE BILL THOUGH IS THAT. ALL THE REGULATIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE I'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH AN ENTIRE APA NOTICE AND COMMENT PROCESS SO -- THESE HAVE BEEN VETTED ALREADY IT'S IT'S THE ROLL BACK THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ISSUE I THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN. LOOK AT THEIR AYE AYE HI I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT THE PATH IS BUT I'LL I'LL LET MY ADVISER HERE COMMENT MORE THERE AND THEN TO THE TO THIS ADDITION THIS SECTION ONE THAT WAS REFERRED TO JUST NOW ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION SALE. OF FISH WILDLIFE PLANTS I THINK WHAT WAS UNDERLYING THAT WAS A CONCERN ABOUT -- ILLEGAL SALES OF ENDANGERED TROPHY HUNTED SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN BIG ISSUE INTERNATIONALLY AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDED -- TO NO LONGER UPHOLD THE BAN ON IMPORTED -- AFRICAN DANGER SPECIES AND SO -- I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO TO LOOKING THROUGH THE MECHANICS THERE AND IF IT IS OVERLY BROAD OR THERE SHOULD OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD AREA TO SPEND SOME TIME ON BUT I DON'T SPEAK TOO FAR TO TURN OUT OF TURN OVER -- TO THE YEAH MISTER FINO OKAY. WITH RESPECT TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES PROVISIONS THAT THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY -- IS CREAMERS -- THE ACTUALLY THE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT RIGHTLY SO THAT -- HOW YOU DEFINE BASS? AND HOW YOU DEFINE STRINGENCY IS LEFT UP TO THE END UP TO THE AGENCY AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PROVISIONS ARE FROZEN IN TIME OR SCIENCE IS FROZEN IN TIME. SO -- I THINK THAT THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE ISSUE. THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PUT INTO SECTION ONE IS ACTUALLY TAKEN AND PRETTY MUCH DIRECTLY OUT OF THE LACEY ACT WHICH IS A FEDERAL ACTIVE PROHIBITS ON THE IMPORTATION. OF ANIMAL ANIMALS OR ANIMAL PARTS IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW -- OR LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES -- AND SO BUT WITH THE POINT THAT THE THAT NO WELL NOW THAT MISS CREAMERS MADE I THINK IS A DECENT ONE IN THE SENSE OF WE CAN CERTAINLY ADD LANGUAGE THAT MAKES IT CLEAR. THAT IT'S THE SOURCING ISSUE SO THAT YOU CANNOT ACQUIRE -- AN ITEM IN IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA IN A IT BE IN VIOLATION OF THE PLACE IN WHICH YOU'VE SOURCED THE ITEMS SO IT THIS DOESN'T APPLY. TO CUTTING TREES IN THE DELTA -- OR KILLING CAL IS BECAUSE IS PROHIBITED IN INDIA IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE IF ON THE CALYX EXAMPLE IF IT'S PROHIBITED IN INDIA TO KILL A COW YOU CAN'T KILL THE COUNTY INDIA AND THEN BRING IT. INTO CALIFORNIA'S WE CAN CERTAINLY CLARIFY THAT POINT. THE LOVELY VISUAL. ALL RIGHT -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR ALAN. I YOU KNOW I I ASKED MY FRIEND HERE. TO TELL ME WHAT PORTION THE BILL THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND I I READ THE SECTION I I REALLY THINK THAT'S AND OVER READING I MEAN YOU KNOW I I I GUESS IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GET TO THE LANGUAGE CLARIFIED BUT I'M IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR HERE. THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT -- THIS MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SELL RECEIVE A CHOIR PURCHASE. ITEMS THAT WERE ILLEGALLY OBTAINED IN OTHER STATES IN VIOLATION OF THE STATE'S LAWS. AS OPPOSED TO IT IS ABLANKET WE APPLY EVERY OTHER JURISDICTION'S LAW TO CALIFORNIA. YEAH AT I DON'T KNOW THE PLANE READING OF FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS A THAT'S A TOTAL OVER READ BUT THAT BEING SAID -- IF IT'S AN ISSUE MAKING REYES I'M SURE YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE PLAYING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THING IN HEARING ON SENATOR STERN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. BACK FOR YES. FOR GOOD MOTION BY SENATOR Y. CASKEY THE MOTION IS DO PASS.

AND IF WE GO ON TO WILL TOO LONG I THINK THEY START TALKING OUR PACE SO WITH THAT GENTLE STATEMENT. NO NO THAT'S THAT'S IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. OKAY -- LET'S [inaudible] WHAT? HI -- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE WHOLE OKAY. OKAY -- GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS [inaudible] TITLE. NINE THE FEDERAL SEX EQUITY IN EDUCATION LAW. ALONG WITH CORRESPONDING EXISTING STATE LAW HAS BEEN VITAL. TO ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS WOMEN AND MEN GIRLS AND BOYS AT EVERY GRADE LEVEL. HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS IN ACADEMICS AND ATHLETICS. AND CAN PURSUE AN EDUCATION IN AN ENVIRONMENT SAFE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE. SADLY AND FRANKLY SOMEONE SHOCKINGLY SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS PERVASIVE. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CAMPUS CLIMATE SURVEY VALIDATION STUDY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS OR I SHOULD SAY AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. AN ESTIMATED 62% OF WOMEN AND OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. OE IN FIVE WOMEN. AND ONE IN FOURTEEN MEN EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN COLLEGE ONE IN FIVE WOMEN. HOWEVER DUE TO THE UNDER REPORTING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE THE RATES ARE LIKELY MUCH HIGHER. CALIFORNIA HAS LOOKED TO AND RELIED ON TITLE NINE FOR DECADES. ALONG WITH REQUIREMENTS IN STATE LAW BUT WE ARE COMPLETE THE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED BY THE DISMANTLING OF TITLE NINE TO PROTECTIONS. BY A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT IS EXPRESSED OPEN HOSTILITY TO THE SAFEGUARDS TITLE NINE PROVIDES. INTO ADDRESSING GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IN GENERAL. IT HAS IN FACT ALREADY PROPOSED FEDERAL REGULATIONS SAID GOT TITLE NINE'S CRITICAL PROTECTIONS. SB FOUR NINETY THREE CODIFIES ADDITIONAL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOLS TO FOLLOW. TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW IS EFFECTUATE. INCLUDING. ADDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE EDUCATION CODE. DIRECTING ALL POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES IN REQUIREMENTS REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION INCLUDING ADOPTING AND PUBLISHING GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES. AND PROVIDING FOR PROMPT AND EQUITABLE RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS. AND REQUIRING AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION WHEN IT FINDS ITS SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAS CREATED A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. AND TO ELIMINATE THAT HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT PREVENTED THREE OCCURRENCE AND ADDRESS IT TO FIX. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THIS LEGISLATION. AND I CAN IF I MAY REMIND YOU JUST A FEW DAYS AGO ON THE SENATE FLOOR WE HAD TO HIGH SCHOOL GROUPS OF STUDENTS I THINK THEY CAME FROM SENATOR SKINNER'S. A GROUP OF FROM OAKLAND YOUNG WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY UNDER TITLE NINE TO COMPETE EQUALLY IN ATHLETICS. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF TITLE NINE WOMEN HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMPETE MORE EQUALLY NOT ONLY IN SPORTS BUT IN SCIENCE. AND ALSO TITLE NINE PROVIDES THE PROTECTION. THAT REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT. THAT WILL ENCOURAGE AND ALLOW FOR EVERY STUDENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT WITHIN WHICH TO LEARN AND AS RECEIVE AN EDUCATION. I'M JOINED TODAY BY JESSICA STANDER WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES SPONSOR THE BILL AS WELL AS WELL AS CAROLINE SKATE A STUDENT IN SURVIVOR FROM CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO. WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE JUST A POINT OF ORDER -- CENTER JACKSON MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND COMMENT FIVE ON PAGES FOURTEEN THROUGH TWENTY ONE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. I THANK YOU BYE WELCOME -- TWO MINUTES PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER OF AN ATTORNEY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN PROUD BECAUSE FONG SERVICE BEFORE. NINE THREE FOR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS WE PRACTICE UNDER TITLE NINE AND RELATED FEDERAL AND STATE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS. EDUCATION CIVIL RIGHTS WERE ESTABLISHED TO INSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE PUSH OUT FROM EDUCATION OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY DENIED ACCESS. TO THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE OFTEN BEEN ISOLATED TO THE TO THE LEAST POWERFUL AND PRIVILEGED. THESE ARE THE SAME STUDENTS THAT STILL FACE THREATS THEIR PHYSICAL SAFETY AND ABILITY TO RECEIVE AN ACQUITTAL ACCESS EDUCATION. SEXUAL HARASSMENT INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN COLLEGE IS RAMPANT IN ADDITION TO PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM THESE INCIDENTS ALSO IMPACTS STUDENTS ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AND THRIVE IN EDUCATION. AMPLE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SURVIVORS ARE WOMEN AND THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR LGBT Q. I STUDENTS AND OTHER HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED IN UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT AT SCHOOL. WELL EXISTING STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS ALREADY PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX AND GOVERNMENT FUNDED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES AND REQUIRE EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. THERE IS INSUFFICIENT STATE LAW AND OR AYE GUIDANCE FROM FROM AGENCIES FOR SCHOOLS HAVE IN PLACE ABOUT HOW TO ACTUALLY RESPOND TO SEXUAL ASSAULT TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CIVIL RIGHTS ARE ENFORCED AND UP HELD. AS BEFORE NINE THREE WILL ADDRESS THIS GAP BY OUTLINING PROCESSES FOR STATE FUNDED EDUCATION AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. TO INVESTIGATE AND RESPOND TO ALLEGED HARASSMENT ASSAULT THROUGH A NEUTRAL AND FAIR PROCESS FOR BOTH COMPLAINTS AND RESPONDENTS AND IN THIS WAY THE BILL THE BILL WILL ENSURE THAT CIVIL RIGHTS SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. ARE PROTECTED AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE DRIVE VOTE I KNOW WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO MISS CAROLINE SKATE TO SHARE HER STORY. GOOD EVENING -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB -- FOUR NINE THREE MY NAME'S CAROLINE'S GAY AND I'M A FOURTH YEAR ENGINEERING STUDENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW FIRST HAND WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. DURING MY SOPHOMORE YEAR I WAS REPEATED A FRATERNITY HOUSE BY ANOTHER STUDENT WHO BELONG TO THE FRATERNITY. I WAS TRAUMATIZED AND SUFFERED FROM NIGHTMARES AND PANIC ATTACKS. I WAS SCARED TO BE ON CAMPUS BECAUSE MY RAPIST AND HIS FRATERNITY BROTHERS WERE ON THE ENGINEERING CAMPUS WHERE A HARD CLASSES. I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE TITLE NINE OFFICE SHORTLY AFTER IT OCCURRED. FOR THE FIRST SIXTY WORKING DAYS I RECEIVED A LITTLE COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION. I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SCHOOL WAS SUPPOSED TO COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION IN SIXTY WORKING DAYS. BUT THERE ARE EXTENSIONS WHICH PROLONG THE PROCESS. IT WASN'T UNTIL ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER I FILED MY COMPLAINT THAT I WAS NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAD FINISH THE INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINED THAT MY CLAIM AGAINST MY RAPIST WAS SUBSTANTIATED. HOWEVER I THOUGHT POINT I WASN'T NOTIFIED ABOUT THE DISCIPLINE NOT WOULD BE GIVEN. ON THE LAST DAY POSSIBLE MY REFILLS FILED AN APPEAL. BUT I WASN'T GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE CLAIMS THAT WERE MADE IN FACT I WASN'T EVEN INFORMED ABOUT THE BASIS OF THE APPEAL UNTIL AFTER THE PROCESS WAS INCLUDED IN A DETERMINATION HAD BEEN MADE. A HEARING FOR MY PERPETRATORS DISCIPLINE HIS LAWYER PRESENTED OVER SIX HUNDRED WRITTEN QUESTIONS ADDRESSED TO ME AND SOME OF THE WITNESSES. MANY OF THE QUESTIONS WERE INVASIVE -- RELEVANT AND HARASSING. TO BE HONEST MANY OF THEM FELL ABUSIVE AND WERE SO DISGUSTING THAT I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THEM. BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA MY SCHOOL WORK SUFFERED. TO MAKE THINGS WORSE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO PROVIDE ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS WERE LEFT UP TO YOU INDIVIDUAL PROFESSORS. WHO HAD LITTLE OR NO TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR NAVIGATING THE PROCESS? THESE ACCOMMODATIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR BOTH SIDES BECAUSE THE TITLE NINE OFFICE OFTEN SCHEDULES MEETINGS AND UPDATES DURING CLASSES OR RIGHT BEFORE EXAMS. WELL SOME OF Y PROFESSORS PROVIDED ACCOMMODATIONS OTHERS DID NOT. ONE PROFESSOR TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD CONTENT CONSIDER DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL AND SAID THAT COLLEGE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE WHEN I NOTIFIED HIM THAT I WAS IN A CASE AND MAY NEED ACCOMMODATIONS Là QUARTER. ANOTHER PROFESSOR TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO SEPARATE MY PERSONAL ON MY ACADEMIC LIFE WHEN I ASKED HIM TO SUBMIT AN ASSIGNMENT ONE DAY LATE A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ASSAULT. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW I COULD SEPARATE MY PERSONAL MY ACADEMIC LIFE WHEN I HAD TO FACE MY PERPETRATOR AND HIS ROOMMATES ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS ON CAMPUS. MY GRADES SUFFERED I HAD TO RE TAKE SOME CLASSES. BECAUSE OF THIS I AM GRADUATING A YEAR LATE WHICH IS CAUSED ADDITIONAL STRESS AND A FINANCIAL BURDEN. I'VE MET WITH SCHOOL OFFICIALS ALONG WITH OTHER STUDENTS SURVIVORS TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS IN THE TITLE NINE PROCESS. BUT HAVING HUNDRED SIGNIFICANT PUSHBACK. I FACE MANY MORE ISSUES IN THE TITLE NINE PROCESS THAT I CAN COVER IN MY TIME TODAY. BUT I THINK THESE POINTS -- STREET THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. I'M NOT ALONE I KNOW MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT IN COLLEGE AND INJUSTICE IN THE TITLE NINE PROCESS. COLLEGES NEED TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE PROCESS. TO INVESTIGATE THESE INCIDENCES INCIDENTS AS WELL AS TRAINING FOR SCHOOL OFFICIALS ON HOW TO RESPOND TO SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE SAFE AND ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION. TITLE NINE IS MEANT TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND IT'S IMPACTS THE I'VE EXPERIENCED HAVE DONE THE OPPOSITE. FOR THESE REASONS I SUPPORT SB FOUR NINE THREE THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. FOR PROVIDING THAT. PERSONAL TESTIMONY. I ANY OTHER A MEMBERS THE PUBLIC OR REPRESENT AS OF ORGANIZATION IF YOU COULD PLEASE -- COME THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION.

WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFCIAL POSITION THAT WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR HER STAFF IN THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT ON WORKING WITH INSTITUTE -- INSTITUTIONS CLOSELY TO ENSURE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER ED CAN BE EXECUTED CORRECTLY IN CLEARLY SO WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THANK YOU. ANGIE MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY I WANT TO ECHO THE COUNTY ARE SAYS YOU WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF I KNOW THEY WORKED A NUMBER A NUMBER OF HOURS ON THIS BILL. THE MEMBERS ARE SIGNIFICANT IN SCOPE. I KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE I KNOW THAT AS IN ELSE'S RECORD RECOGNIZES. FOR THE CSU THE ISSUE OF RIGHT OF ACTION IS A GOOD IS A CONTINUOUS CONCERN FOR US -- IT. AUGMENTS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WILL BE IN THIS BILL AT MOVING FORWARD A WE'VE BEEN IT'S A STRONG SUPPORTER OF SB ONE SIX NINE NINE SIX OH MACAM DAILY ON WE AGREE WITH WHAT THE AUTHOR'S ATTEMPT AS WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE BUT ISN'T. A PLACE THAT WORKS AND WORKS WELL FOR ALL STUDENTS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- NOW THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR FOLKS -- IN OPPOSITION TO HAVE ANY. THE RIVER PLEASE COME ON OVER THE TABLE. YOU COULD -- PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION AND KEEP ITS TWO MINUTES PLEASE MY NAME IS CYNTHIA GARRETT. I'M CO PRESIDENT OF FAMILIES ADVOCATING FOR CAMPUS COOPER SPEAKING THE OTHER GUY IT'S A A NONPROFIT GROUP THAT ADVOCATES FOR FAIRNESS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS -- I AGREE WITH SENATOR JACKSON'S VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE AND I SUPPORT TITLE NINE I SUPPORT. GENERALLY THE BILL I JUST HAVE SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH THAT -- I'M CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS WHO WOULD CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES ONE OF WHOM WAS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT -- OUR ORGANIZATION ADVOCATES FOR FAIRNESS WE DON'T TRY TO DENY VICTIMS RIGHTS ARE PROTECTIONS THAT'S NOT OUR THING. I SERVED ON IN AB A TASK FORCE WITH VICTIMS ADVOCATES AND WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH. A BEST PRACTICES TO WHICH WE ALL AGREED WE THERE WAS A CONSENSUS -- I JUST HAVE IS. FEW SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH THE BILL. UP FIRST THAT IT REQUIRES TRAUMA INFORMED INVESTIGATIONS AND HEARINGS. I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE TO USE TRAUMA INFORMED PROCESSES TO INTERVIEW. SOMEONE THAT COMES FORWARD AS THE VICTIM. THEY'RE BASED IN COGNITIVE THERAPY AND THEY ENCOURAGE REPORTING AND DON'T INTIMIDATE THE PERSON WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO TELL THEIR STORY. PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE HOWEVER OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE TRAINING IS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE DIRECTIONS TO DISCOUNT OR IGNORE CERTAIN BEHAVIOR. SUCH AS AS A SIDE EFFECT OF TRAUMA SUCH AS A COMPLAINANT MISREPRESENTING OR TELLING INCONSISTENT STORIES. BEHAVING AND CONSISTENTLY WITH HAVING BEEN OF SALTED. NOW THOSE ISSUES COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE TRAUMA. BUT THEY ALSO COULD HAVE OTHER CAUSES ORMOTIVATION AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN JUST ENTIRELY THROWING OUT THIS WHOLE CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE RATHER THAN TAKING IT IN. AND CONSIDERING WHETHER IT IS IN FACT THE RESULT OF TRAUMA OR IS PERHAPS SOME OTHER MOTIVATION -- IN FACT UC SANTA BARBARA HAD JUST RECENTLY HAD A DECISION THAT SAYS THAT THE EVALUATION WAS IMPROPERLY BASED ON THE TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACH -- AND THIS POOR POST ONE SIXTY NINE WORKING GROUP THEY AGREE THEY SAID THE EXACT SAME THING YOU DECISION MAKERS MUST BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE AND DETERMINED AS A QUESTION OF FACT. AND NOT IGNORE A CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE -- ANOTHER THING WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THE RACIAL IMPLICATIONS PERTAIN ONLY TO VICTIMS. OF MINORITIES WE'RE SEEING A LOT WE HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME TO US WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF MINORITIES LOWER INCOME STUDENTS BEING. ACCUSED AND CAN'T AFFORD ATTORNEYS TO VINDICATE THEIR pPROBLEM. THE LAST THING IS THE S. BEFORE NINETY THREE DENIES BOTH TE LIFE HEARING AND A CROSS EXAMINATION BY A PARTY'S ADVISER. THIS IS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO SEVERAL CALIFORNIA HELLIP COURT DECISIONS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT SAY YOU CANNOT HAVE A SINGLE INVESTIGATOR PROCESS AND CREDIBILITY. AT A LIVE HEARING AND THE WORKING GROUP POSTS SIX ONE SIXTY NINE ALSO AGREES WITH THAT. THANK YOU. YOU A CALL AND WE'LL LEAVE OPEN THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD YOU WISH TO REPLY TO THE AMENDMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO -- I'M A FATHER FOR MIXED RACE CHILDREN THREE DAUGHTERS AND A SON ALL OF WHOM ATTENDED CALIFORNIA PUBLIC YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NAME -- JONDO. JOHN DOE I'M HE HAS ON STATE TO STAY ANONYMOUS IF I COULD. I KNOW HIM THOUGH. A RETIRED COMBAT VETERAN OF OVER THIRTY YEARS IN A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT FOR FIFTEEN I'VE HELD NUMEROUS LEADERSHIP POSITIONS INCLUDING COMMANDING OFFICER. I PARTICIPATED IN ALL ASPECTS OF DISCIPLINARY ADMIN BOARDS OVER MY CAREER. AND I AM PAINFULLY AWARE THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS IS PARAMOUNT TO JUSTICE BIASES AGENDAS AND PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS HAVE NO PLACE IN THE PROCESS TITLE NINE IS VERY SERIOUS. AND PERMANENTLY PUNITIVE. THE GROSSLY UNFAIR AND DEVASTATING TITLING PROCESS IS DESTROYED MANY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. MY SON'S PROCESS INVOLVED A TRAUMA INFORMED INVESTIGATION WITH NO HEARING NO ACCESS TO THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM A SINGLE INVESTIGATOR A PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF GUILT AND NO ABILITY TO POSE QUESTIONS OR CROSS EXAMINE HIS ACCUSER OR HER WITNESSES. THE CURRENT PROCESS THAT SB FOUR NINETY THREE SIXTY CODIFIED INTO LAW. FROM THE EVIDENCE OBTAINED THE COURT MANDATED RECORD TWO YEARS AFTER MY SON WAS EXPELLED. IS PAINFULLY CLEAR MY SON WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY A FEMALE STUDENT WHO FILED A TITLE. NINE COMPLAINT AGAINST HIM AFTER HE TOLD ME WHAT HAD NO DESIRE TO HAVE RELATIONS WITH HER AND SHE DISCOVERED HE HAD NO MEMORY OF THEIR INTERACTIONS. GRAVE TRANSGRESSIONS WERE COMMITTED UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS INCLUDING CHANGING WITNESS STATEMENTS FIVE CRITICAL WITNESSES SWORE. THAT THEY'RE IN THAT THERE. TESTIMONY WAS MISREPRESENTED AND THE INVESTIGATOR'S NOTES CONFIRM THIS WELL MEANING HIDING IN DISCOUNTING EXONERATING EVIDENCE. REFUSING TO INTERVIEW EXONERATING WITNESSES AND FAILING TO COLLECT ANY EVIDENCE FROM THE ACCUSER OR WITNESSES THE SINGLE INVESTIGATOR HAD TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE PROCESS AND THE OUTCOME. THE TITLING COORDINATOR INVESTIGATOR WITH BOTH TRAIN LAWYERS THIS WAS NOT A FAIR UNBIASED PROCESS THIS WAS A MALICIOUS PROSECUTION. MY SON TOLD THE TRUTH HE BELIEVE THE PROCESS WOULD BE FAIR IN THE TRUTH WOULD EXONERATE HIM. BUT THE CLAIMED VICTIM WAS BELIEVED IN SPITE OF HER INCONSISTENCY CHANGES ANALYZE ALL WERE TRIBUTE TO TRAUMA AND MY SON'S INCONSISTENCIES MANUFACTURED BY THE INVESTIGATOR WERE USED AGAINST HIS CREDIBILITY. HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO QUESTION HER OR HER WITNESSES. MY SON WAS FOUND RESPONSIBLE WITHOUT ONE SHRED OF EVIDENCE HE WAS EXPELLED FOR LIFE DUE TO HIS ACCUSERS FINAL CLAIM. THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE TRENCHES IN CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES INNOCENT STUDENTS ARE BEING EXPELLED. THE PROCESS IS CORRUPT. AND DEVASTATING TO FAMILIES I'M DISGUSTED AT THE BEHAVIOR THESE ADMINISTRATORS WITH A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR DUE PROCESS AND LACK OF INTEGRITY. SB FOUR NINETY THREE IN ITS CURRENT FORM IS RECKLESS AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS MINORITY AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS MOST CANNOT MOUNT A LEGAL DEFENSE. POOR AND MINORITY STUDENTS ARE BEING RAILROADED AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THIS ROAD SB FOUR NINETY THREE THANK YOU. THANKS. OUR I THINK THERE WAS SOME -- QUESTION ON WHETHER OR NOT -- JONDO WOULD BE -- SUFFICIENT -- I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT ANSWER FOR THAT BUT AND GIVEN THE SENSITIVITY I THINK -- FOR THAT THIS BY LAW TO RESPECT THAT. BUT BRINGING -- DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION IF YOU CAN I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. I AM MRS JOHN DOE. I'M WITH CALIFORNIA DUE PROCESS JUSTICE AND I SPEAK FOR HUNDREDS OF OTHER JOHN DOES WHO ARE UNABLE TO COME HERE. OUT OF FEAR OF BEING SLANDERED AND ATTACKED AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE. BILL FOR NINETY THREE BECAUSE IT DENIES EVERY CALIFORNIA CITIZEN DUE PROCESS RIGHTS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBER THE PUBLIC -- WISHING. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE OPPORTUNITY SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE DAIS -- DO WE HAVE -- FOR MEMBERS WISHING TO TO COMMENT CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- ONE THING ALL THE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION. JUST LIKE TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE OPPORTUNITY OR TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS OF DUE PROCESS PROTECTION THAT'S EXACTLY THE REASON FOR THE BILL. WE'RE WE'RE SETTING UP TO PROCESS YOU KNOW WHEN -- WHEN THIS ISSUE BECAME IS STARTED FINALLY? GETTING RECOGNIZE BECAUSE ALL THE STUDIES WERE SHOWING THE PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS. COLLEGES. RECOGNIZED THAT THEY REALLY NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT MOST COLLEGES ARE NOT COURTS. AND SO THE VARIOUS KINDS OF SYSTEMS THAT THEY SET UP CLEARLY WERE NOT ADEQUATE WE'VE SEEN IT FROM BOTH SIDES IN THIS INSTANCE AND THAT IS WHY THIS BILL. EXISTS. SO WE HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY WHEN A HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION HAS A DUTY TO RESPOND TO INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE TAKING POLICEOFF CAMPUS WE SPECIFY THAT THE CAMPUS GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE MUST SEPARATE THE INVESTIGATOR IN THE JUDICATA ROLES. THEY'RE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THEY'RE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AS THEY SHOULD BE -- IT WE SPECIFY. THAT WE WORK WITH WE ALSO THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES ALIVE. BUT IT COULD BE IN DIRECT CROSS EXAMINATION. BEFORE A NEUTRAL ADJUDICATOR. SO NOBODY HAS ANY SKIN IN THE GAME IF YOU WILL IT'S NOT AN INVESTIGATOR WHO'S. COME UP WITH ANY PERSONAL OPINIONS IT'S A NEUTRAL ADJUDICATOR WAS SPECIFIED SAFEGUARDS. AGAINST THE USE OF CROSS EXAMINATION FOR PURPOSES OF INTIMIDATION OR HARASSMENT. IN THAT OF COURSE THE JUDICATA -- IS ABLE TO DO BECAUSE THERE ARE WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THEY ARE QUALIFIED THEY ARE TRAINED THIS IS INTERESTED TEACHER THAT THEY IF YOU KNOW WHO HAS SPARE TIME AFTER CLASS WE ARE REQUIRING THAT THIS BE A A PROCESS WORD. OF IT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THESE ISSUES THAT ALSO ARE A TRAINED ON TRAUMA -- BUT ALSO THE INDEPENDENT NEUTRAL ADJUDICATOR -- IT GETS THE INFORMATION AND THE EVIDENCE IF YOU WILL THAT IS PRESENTED. THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY TO ASK QUESTIONS TO GO THROUGH THIS OUR CROSS EXAMINATION TYPE PROCESS THROUGH QUESTIONS. I THINK THE WITNESS TESTIFIED THAT THERE WERE SO MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY OF THEM TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE THAT WERE ASKED OF HER. AN ARBITRATOR CAN SAY WAIT A MINUTE. YOU KNOW. IN A LIKE A LIKE A JUDGE WOULD DO IF THIS WERE ACTUALLY IN A CRIMINAL CASE WHICH BY THE WAY IT IS NOT. BUT WE ARE REQUIRING THE ABILITY TO HAVE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL HEARING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT TITLE NINE CALLS. FOR SO -- IT WE ALSO MODIFY IT IN THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE TO THE PROVISION OF A LIST OF ATTORNEYS AND OTHER RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO BOTH SIDES -- AND AGAIN. RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO A NUMBER. ONE ADDRESS THIS THIS SCOURGE ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES -- HAVING A PROCESS BY WHICH ALLEGATIONS CAN BE BROUGHT FORWARD THAT THEY CAN BE -- IDENTIFIED AND HEARD IN AN IMPARTIAL. ADJUDICATORY FASHION THAT THE RESOLUTION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS. OF THE VICTIM IF IT DETERMINES THAT THE RATE THAT THAT THE FACTS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO HAVE OCCURRED. MANY OF THEM SIMPLE THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS DON'T HAVE. TO CEDAR THEIR PERPETRATOR ON CAMPUS MOVING THEM FROM ONE DORM TO ANOTHER THESE ARE THE KINDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACT. UNLESS THEY ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE REACHED A LEVEL WHERE SOME OTHER KIND OF ACTION IS APPROPRIATE BUT TO BE DONE IN AN IMPARTIAL MANNER. I THINK THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE. ALL HAD. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO BETTER MONNING DO YOU HAVE -- ANY MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. A MOVIE ON TO A CENTER JONES. AS A DENSER COVER EURO VERY MUCH FOR THE EXPLANATION THOSE AMENDMENTS -- ARE THOSE THE MEMBERS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED WITH A PART OF YOUR BILL. LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED OR ARE THESE NEW PROVISIONS THAT ARE TO THIS BILL. YOU KNOW AT THIS MOMENT TIME I CAN'T RECALL PERHAPS YOU CAN. YET GENERALLY THEIR NEW SO THAT MEANT THAT CENTER JACKSON MENTION WITH THE RED CROSS EXAMINATION MAKES IT CLEAR CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THE BILL IS FULLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REASON ALL THE DECISION -- THAT'LL THAT REQUIRES ALIVE BUT IT CAN BE DIRECT INDIRECT CROSS EXAMINATION OF BOTH SIDES BOTH COMPLAINING AND RESPONDED AS WELL AS WITNESSES AND ENDED DOES ALSO REFLECTED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CASES THAT HAVE COME DOWN SINCE THEN SO WE WANTED. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ON THE SAME TRACK OF ABIDING BY THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN REACHED. THOSE WERE MY MAJOR CONCERNS THAT WE'RE GONNA CAUSE ME TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL -- TONIGHT BUT WITH THAT I'M I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY AND GIVE MY STAFF AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS AND AND WHERE IS IT GOING FROM HERE POPES OR FIVE I BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATIONS OKAY LOCATION. FURNITURE. OKAY -- DO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO GIVE -- SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE A COPY OF THE AMENDMENTS. THEY'RE IN THE ANALYSIS. DO YOU HAVE -- IS THAT IT SOME HANDED OUT TODAY. BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN IT I LOOK TO THE BILL ONLINE TO SEE IF THERE'S BEEN ANY AND A WHAT. AND ANNA I AGREE WITH THE AMENDMENT. OKAY THAT RESERVE HELP A LOT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET YOU A COPY A CENTER COVER EURO. THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY QUESTION FIRST LIGHT I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO CAME TO TESTIFY REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOU SHARING WHAT IS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY DIFFICULT [inaudible] ON DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE AND AND THERE ARE FORTY EIGHT AMENDMENTS IT'S THE DIFFICULTY OF SEEING THEM IN A KIND OF AN SEQUENCES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY MARK OUT. BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEM IT IT IT MAKES SENSE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A COPY OF THE OF THE OPINION AND I I THINK I THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPY BECAUSE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED ARE ARE ACTUALLY -- IN IN THE AMENDMENT SO I THINK THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO ADD BECAUSE I I'M REALIZING AS WE'VE BEEN GOING TO THESE HEARINGS THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT SHOW UP HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY SEE THE AMENDMENT SO. YES -- CENTER ALLEN. OKAY -- IS A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO ASK ABOUT ONE OF THEM IS THAT -- YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS IN HIGHER AND ARE NOT A LOT BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AN INSUBSTANTIAL NUMBER -- OUR OF OUR REPRESENTED BY A UNION. RIGHT TO THE GRADUATE STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS -- THE POSTDOCS I'M. IT -- WHO ARE OUT CAN YOU TELL US HOW THIS IMPLICATES A COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED GREEN GRIEVANCE PROCEDRE -- ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE. STUDENTS. AND HAS THERE BEEN I NOTICED THAT THE LIKE YOUR C. W. WAS ON BOARD THE BILL BUT I I I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING FROM. I ANY OF THE UNIONS THAT REPRESENT -- EITHER THE POSTDOCS THE GRADUATE INSTRUCTORS AND WE REACH OUT TO THEM TODAY WE HEAR BACK FROM THEM BUT I WAS INTERESTED IF THERE IF HOW THIS INTERPLAY'S. WITH EXISTING. COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES MAY EXIST ON THE CAMPUSES -- THAT'S INITIATING THAT THE REMAINS BE INVESTIGATED IN TERMS OF THE STUDENT UNION GRADUATE STUDENT UNIONS SO I AT THIS POINT THE BILL DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE. WHEN THERE'S JUST BROKE GRADUATE STUDENT UNION THAT IS UNIONIZED ANY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT MIGHT SUPERSEDE THESE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THREE WOULD SUPERSEDE YOU THINK -- BUT WE HAVE TO RESEARCH THAT ISSUE WITH REGARD TO THE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT UNDERGRAD I DON'T THINK WOULD BE PART OF THE UNIONS BUT FOR THE GRADUATE UNIONIZED STUDENTS. SO WE CAN WE CAN RESEARCH IT OKAY AT THIS POINT THE FOCUSES ON THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS THAT'S THE THE FOCUS OF THIS -- LEGISLATION RIDLEY CERTAINLY THERE SHOULD BE. A MINUTE MY OPINION WOULD BE THAT THE THIS IS A DUE PROCESS ISSUE AND THAT THE THE THIS. SIMILAR THE SAME OR SIMILAR REGULATION SHOULD APPLY BUT THAT'S NOT THE NATE THAT THAT'S OUTSIDE THE FOUR CORNERS OF THIS BILL THE BILL DOES. PRISON WE COVERED RESIDENTS TO NOW. YES IT DOES BUT NOT UNION IS NOT THOSE SUBJECT TO UNION CONTRACTS UNION. AFFILIATED GRADUATES TO OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT WAS ONE THING AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION WAS I YOU KNOW I REMEMBER -- THE GOVERNOR -- SO GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED [inaudible] IN EARLIER. SB SIX ONE SIX NINE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR THIS BILL -- AND THEN I'VE I YOU KNOW. TODAY'S BEEN SO CRAZY WE JUST. GOD THIS IS THE CENTRAL MEMBER YOU KNOW -- SERIES OF OF OF AN ANALYSIS JUST YESTERDAY SO I'M HI BUT TO WHAT EXTENT I I WAS GIVEN I WAS JUST GIVEN A COPY OF THE THE THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE VETOED. ONE SIXTY NINE WENT ON TO ASK FOR GOVERNOR FOR GROUP OF EXPERTS TO STUDY THE MATTER AND THIS THREE MEMBER PANEL WAS PULLED TOGETHER [inaudible] FROM AT MOVING OF A PROFESSOR FROM UC BERKELEY -- WENDY BROWN A MEMBER FOR REMEMBER THE OF THE STATE SUPREME COURT IN THE LARGE SAMPLES DO YOU SEE. SCHOOL YOU SOIL SCHOOL OF LAW AND I'M. THEY HAVE COME FOR OVER THE WHOLE SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE S. THE S. B. ONE SIX NINE VETO. TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET -- TO THE BOTTOM OF SO I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF HIS YOU TO WHAT EXTENSIVE HAVE YOU. INCORPORATED THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT. YOU KNOW THE THIS IS FOR YOUR CURRENT BILL WHAT FOR NINETY THREE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR -- TO ONE SIXTY NINE I YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ REALLY. LEVEL DETAIL THAT OUT OF LIGHT BUT AND TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT. CORRELATE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUP -- I CAN DOES ON THAT -- THE BILL HAS SOME OF PROVISIONS THAT ARE SIMILAR -- TO ONE SIX NINE BUT SOME DIFFERENT AND THE BILL ITSELF IN ADDITION WITH THE NEW AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TODAY COMMITTEE -- MAKE IT THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TASK FORCE TO SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS -- OF CONSISTENCY IN A DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT MS GARRETT BROUGHT UP -- ARE ONE THAT SEXUAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT INCLUDES SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL VIOLENCE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING TRAINING ON TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES DURING THE MESSAGE RIGHT PROCESS. USING THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE STANDARD THEY KIND OF DESCRIBE THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE STANDARD IN A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT WAY THAN IT'S MORE COMMONLY USED -- BUT THEY THEY AGREE IN THE REPORT THAT THAT IS THE STANDARD THAT SHOULD BE APPLIED -- HAVE THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL THE DESIRED WHICH IS IN THIS BILL AS WELL AND THEN FINALLY ENSURING THAT CROSS EXAMINATION IS ALLOWED -- BUT BUT IF IN DIRECT IS OKAY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT SAYS THAT WITH WITH THE NEW AMENDMENTS THAT CROSS EXAMINATION LIVE CROSS EXAMINATION IS -- REQUIRED BUT IT CAN BE IN DIRECT AND THAT'S REALLY TO PREVENT THE KIND OF HARASSING BEHAVIOR THAT WE'VE SEEN ADVOCATES REPRESENT US STUDENTS IN THE SEMI PROCEEDINGS WE SEEN SOMETIMES -- THE RESPONDENTS AND OFTEN THEIR ATTORNEYS USING REALLY HARASSING AGGRESSIVE IN OFTEN ABUSIVE TACTICS IN THIS CROSS EXAMINATION PROCESS SO THIS WOULD ALLOW THESE PROTECTIONS FOR THE NEUTRAL JUDICATA -- TO RECEIVE THE QUESTIONS PRESENT THEM LIVE MEANING THAT THE WITH EITHER PARTY HAS RESPOND IN LIVE TIME REAL TIME -- BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DIRECT WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WORK TASK FORCE REPORT. OKAY AND I I SAYS WELL AS COURT RECENT COURT DECISIONS THIS ACCORD WITH YOUR ANSWERING YES ACTUALLY IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE THE WORKING GROUP RELIED HEAVILY ON THE A BA TASK FORCE ON WHICH I SAT. OKAY IF YOU'LL SEE THROUGHOUT THE FOOTNOTES ARE ALL QUOTED QUOTED RAIL ABA AND WE WORKED VERY HARD WE HAD VICTIMS ADVOCATES WE HAD CAMPUS ADMINISTRATORS AND WE HAD DEFENSE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. AND WE HAMMERED IT OUT WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO CONSENSUS SO I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD. REPORT AND I I DO THINK THAT. US SENATOR JACKSON AND I FORGOT YOUR NAME JESSICA SKINNER. HAVE INCORPORATED MUCH MORE OF IT UNDER WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING NOW I JUST HADN'T SEEN IT IT WASN'T ON THE ONLINE -- JUST THREE MALE ONE NOTE ON THAT THAT'S AND IT'S NOT A BE A RESOLUTION IT'S JUST A REPORT OF ONE SECTION OF THE AB EIGHT JUST TO BE CLEAR. WHAT DOES REFLECT THE POLICY OF THE ABA? THE SECTION BECAUSE THERE WERE IS THAT. WOULD YOU CALL IT SOCIAL JUSTICE AFTER YOUR RATES CITED. SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGH THE COURSE YEAH YEAH I KNOW WE WORKED VERY HARD ON THAT BUT THERE WAS A VICTIMS ADVOCATE AND A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTION NOT CRIMINAL NO. SOCIAL JUSTICE SECTION OF THE VIEW THAT DIDN'T AGREE WITH US -- SURROUNDED ANYMORE MORE QUESTIONS -- I THINK -- SORT OF LIKE CENTER ALLEN -- YOU KNOW FROM WE'RE IN A DAY WITH A LOT OF INFORMATION -- I DIDN'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH -- THE AMENDMENTS MY INITIAL CONCERN -- IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT BALANCE WAS STRUCK IS THAT WE HEARD. TESTIMONY -- FROM -- A VICTIM I AND WE ALSO HEARD THE TESTIMONY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE. THE ALLEGED PERPETRATOR WAS OF A VICTIM [inaudible] ODD OR THAT'S THE WAY -- THAT THAT EXPERIENCE -- SCENARIO WAS PLAYED OUT. MAKING CERTAIN THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING. HAS THE ABILITY TO CROSS EXAMINE. EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH AN AGENT. I THINK IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR TO PROCESS -- BUT I RARELY THEIR **** AMENDMENTS -- THAT ARE NOW IN PLACE -- THAT I THINK OFFER SOME PROTECTIONS I'D LIKE THIS THEY THOSE MORE DETAIL. THIS ALL PROBABLY LAY OFF ON THIS -- BY DAY -- BEFORE WE GO TO FINAL COMMENTS ANY OTHER -- COMMENTS FROM -- FROM. THE DAIS ALRIGHT WE'LL A MOVE THIS OVER -- BACK TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE MOTION AND TO APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. I AM HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A FIND. IF YOU WILL THE SORT OF A A BALANCING POINT A SWEET SPOT THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. BUT IT IS ONE WHERE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES AND SO THERE ARE LEVELS OF DUE PROCESS WE'RE TRYING TO FIND AT THAT SWEET SPOT IN HAVE. BEEN WORKING WITH -- ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE CONVENED A NUMBER OF MEETINGS THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS I THINK WE'RE WE'RE ALMOST THERE AS FAR AS GIVING THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY -- TO BOTH THE PARTIES IN THESE MATTERS I PERSONALLY HOPE THAT WE WILL FIND A DAY IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE WHEN. THIS WHOLE -- EPIDEMIC DOESN'T EXIST BUT IN THE MEANTIME -- WE HAVE GOT TO GET A HANDLE ON IT AND TO WE KNOW THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ASSAULT IN PETER'S STUDENTS RIGHT TO PURSUE AND RECEIVE AN EDUCATION IN A SAFE. NON DISCRIMINATORY ENVIRONMENT AND I BELIEVE THIS MEASURE PROVIDES A BASELINE PROCESS FOR OUR HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. TO ACCESS THAT EQUITABLE. EXPERIENCE AND THE PROTECTIONS OF TITLE NINE WHICH I HAVE SUPPORTED. SINCE IT'S CONSIDERED THE INCEPTION I THINK IT BEEN CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS.
