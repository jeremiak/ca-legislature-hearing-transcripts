PARCEL.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.250
IN A WAY THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.684
ACHIEVABLE TO BUILD.

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.553
A UNIVERSITY QUITE AFFORDABLY

THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES

PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE HAS --

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.396
COUPLE ISSUES TO CONSIDER.

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:38.898
OF THE FACT THE MINISTRATION IS

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.267
PROPOSING FUNDS FOR STUDY

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.201
SUGGESTS THE GOVERNOR.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:43.169
WOULD LIKE TO ASSESS CERTAIN

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:46.205
CRITERIA CERTAIN FACTORS BEFORE

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:47.506
COMMITTING TO A NEW CAMPUS THE

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:49.041
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT YET

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.676
CLARIFIED WHICH FACTORS HE WOULD

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:52.812
LIKE TO CONSIDER.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:53.913
A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:57.283
ASKED OUR OFFICE -- TO TO ASSESS

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:59.351
WHETHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITY WAS

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:01.153
JUSTIFIED BASED ON ONE KEY

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.788
FACTOR AND THAT WAS.

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:03.689
PROJECTED ENROLLMENT AND

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.524
PHYSICAL CAPACITY OF EXISTING

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.693
CAMPUSES AND IN THAT REPORT WE

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.828
FOUND THAT THE STATE COULD

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.029
ACCOMMODATE GROWTH IN MOST

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:12.264
REGIONS INCLUDING THE CENTRAL

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:12.765

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.166
OF BY BUILDING OUT EXISTING

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.801
CAMPUSES.

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:17.103
THAT SAID THE ADMINISTRATION

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:19.438
MATE MIGHT HAVE OTHER FACTORS IN

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.107
MIND -- OTHER CRITERIA TO

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.475
CONSIDER WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE FOR

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.610
EXAMPLE THE COMMUTING TIME FOR

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.745
STUDENTS TO TRAVEL TO A PUBLIC

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:27.847
UNIVERSITY OR ECONOMIC

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:28.981
DEVELOPMENT.

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:31.550
OF A LOCAL OR REGIONAL AREA NO

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:32.651
LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO BETTER

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.753
UNDERSTAND WHAT FACTORS THE

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.490
ADMINISTRATION HAS IN MIND WHEN

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:38.724
A JESSE.

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.659
ASSESSING THIS PROPOSAL.

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:41.794
LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY WILL ALSO

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:42.995
WANT TO KNOW A LOT MORE DETAILS

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:44.363
ABOUT HOW THIS TW MILLION

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.431
DOLLARS.

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.133
WOULD BE SPENT WHAT THE SCOPE

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:48.801
WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE IS A

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:51.670
PROPOSED TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:53.973
FOR FACILITY PLANS AS WELL OR

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.308
FINANCING PLANS PLANS TO BUILD

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.777
OUT ACADEMIC PROGRAMS IS IT FROM

00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:00.713
FIRE MENTAL REVIEWS.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:01.514
SO LEGISLATURE OLDEST BE WANT TO

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.115
WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:05.217
SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS WHAT IT

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.052
ENTAILS.

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.921
AND WHAT THE DELIVERABLES WILL

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:09.088
BE.

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:12.591
THANK YOU.

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:13.292
THE RAIN STORM AGAIN FROM C.

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:14.360
ISSUE I THINK ONE THING THAT I

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.061
WANTED TO POINT OUT FROM -- MY

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.596
COLLEAGUE FROM THE LA -- WHEN HE

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:19.231
SAID THAT WE AGREE WITH THIS IS

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.766
THAT FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT WE

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.101
BELIEVE THAT WE DO HAVE

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:23.068
SUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND ALL OF

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.603
OUR CAMPUSES THAT?

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.205
WE COULD BUILD OUT ARE ALL OF

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:27.640
OUR CAMPUSES AND ADD ADDITIONAL

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.742
ROMANCE IN OUR EXISTING TWENTY

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:31.377
THREE CAMPUSES.

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:32.378
BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:33.913
GOVERNOR ONE WHO AGREED -- TO

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:34.547
STUDYING SOME NEW CAMPUSES WE

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:36.982
HAVE A LONG ESTABLISHED POLICY

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.517
THAT THE BOARD EMPLOYEES.

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.386
IN REVIEWING WHETHER OUR CAMPUS

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:42.254
SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE DEVELOP

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:43.355
THERE'S A LOT OF CRITERIA THAT

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:45.491
ARE LAID OUT IN.

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:47.092
IN IN OUR POLICIES -- THE OTHER

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.394
THING TOO IS THAT WITH THAT

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.895
MONEY IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE THAT

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.197
MONEY WE WOULD DO ALL THE WORK

00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:52.565
THAT YOU WOULD WANT US TO DO AND

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:54.466
ANALYZE WHATEVER SCOPE WORK THAT

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:56.268
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IN IN US

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:59.672
PURSUING -- AND THEN -- I THINK

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:00.306
JUST THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IF

00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:01.507
YOU WILL IF YOU ARE INTERESTED

00:14:01.574 --> 00:14:02.908
IN PURSUING THIS THAN WE'RE

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:04.276
WILLING TO DO THE WORK.

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:05.411
OBVIOUSLY THOUGH THAT ONE THING

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:07.613
THAT IS SOMETHING OF CONCERN TO

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.815
THE C. ISSUE IN GENERAL WITH.

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:12.151
A NEW CAMPUSES IS THAT WE DO

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:13.819
LAUNCHER OR TAKEOVER PARTICULAR

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:16.889
CAMPUSES OFTENTIMES WHAT WE HAVE

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.257
TO DO IS WE HAVE TO AND THIS IS

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:19.191
GONNA SOUND LITTLE BIT.

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.860
COURSE BUT WE HAVE TO STARBUCKS

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.796
CAMPUSES IN ORDER -- TO TO

00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:26.865
REALLY -- SUPPORT NEW CAMPUSES --

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:27.666
TO GET THEM TO CAPACITY IN TERMS

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:28.834
OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT SORT

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.035
OF THING SO.

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:32.171
IN THE PAST WE'VE YOU KNOW HAD

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:34.006
THE DEVELOPMENT MONTEREY BAY --

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:35.274
WE'VE TAKEN ON THE MARITIME

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:37.743
ACADEMY IN THE EARLY NINETIES

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.713
ALSO -- I THINK SAN MARCOS WAS

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:41.847
ANOTHER CAMPUS WHERE IT WAS KIND

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:43.215
OF YOUR TAKE YOUR GOING FROM A

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:47.486
CENTER SORT OF POSITION TO

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:48.754
DEVELOPING INTO FULL BLOWN

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.089
CAMPUS WILL SERVE CHANNEL

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:50.889
ISLANDS.

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.124
WAS WHEN MOST RECENT ONES.

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.492
IT'S A TO GET THOSE CAMPUSES THE

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.960
CAPACITY.

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:55.694
OF FROM MAYBE NOTHING YOU'RE

00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:56.695
LOOKING AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:58.230
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF

00:14:58.297 --> 00:14:59.431
RESOURCES TO GET A CAMPUS TO

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:01.900
ROUGHLY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FULL

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:02.668
TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS WHICH

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.870
IS KIND OF OUR KIND OF BALLPARK

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:06.171
OF WHERE WE THINK A SELF

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:08.874
SUSTAINING UNIVERSITY CAN BE.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.042
DOES THAT INCLUDE THE CAPITAL

00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:11.343
COST IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.278
CAPITAL COSTS OF THE OPERATING

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.345
COST OF ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:14.246
MILLION DOLLARS THAT DOESN'T.

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:15.414
INCLUDE OTHER CAPITAL COST MY

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:16.448
COLLEAGUE COULD TALK TO YOU A

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:17.850
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:20.853
PRICE TAG OF VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:23.222
THAT BUT I WOULD I MEAN I WAS AT

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:23.789
ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WERE.

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:29.361
GOING FIRST WHAT WE HAVE TO VIEW

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:31.230
THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THE

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:32.298
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:33.565
LITTLE ON THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:35.634
THESE OF THIS SYSTEM PLUS THE UC

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:36.802
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:39.338
IS THE STATE WHICH BY MY MATHIS

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:40.472
SOMEWHERE OR THE REPORTED.

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.007
TOTALS ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN.

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:42.608
EIGHT TO NINE BILLION DOLLARS

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:43.275
JUST ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:44.310
SIDE NOT.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.911
TOTALING UP THE CAPITAL PROJECT --

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:50.182
NEEDS FOR FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION.

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:51.550
A SO WE HAVE THAT.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.117
TO THAT'S THE CONTEXT WERE

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.552
OPERATING IN HERE.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.522
SO HAVING STARTED A COUPLE AT

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:59.124
LEAST ONE OR TWO NEW CAMPUSES IN

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:04.029
THE LAST COUPLE DECADES WHY.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:06.965
WHAT IS THE COST OF SETTING UP A?

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:07.833
A NEW C. ISSUE CAMPUS

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.133
[inaudible]

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.337
ALL IN.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.005
WHAT WILL THEY THINK OF A UC

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:14.606
MERCED I WOULD SAY BILLION

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:15.274
DOLLARS?

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.975
BILLION.

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.243
IS THERE CAPITAL PLAN.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.479
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OPERATING

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.047
COSTS THE LABELS AND ON TOP OF

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:23.215
THAT YEAH WHAT WHAT I WHAT I'M

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.950
REFERENCING IS GENERALLY THE

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:26.518
OPERATING BUDGET FOR OUR CHANNEL

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:32.324
ISLANDS CAMPUS WHICH HAS ABOUT.

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:32.825
FIVE THOUSAND FULL TIME

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:33.158
EQUIVALENTS.

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:33.325
SO.

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:35.060
WHEN YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THIS

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.228
BEFORE SO WHAT CAN YOU IN LIKE

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:36.862
ME A LITTLE BIT AS TO WHAT THE

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.497
FACTORS ARE THAT YOU LOOK AT

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:41.800
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO SAY?

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:44.436
TO THE NEW CAMPUS SOMEWHERE.

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:44.970
WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT THE

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:47.139
ENROLLMENT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.474
CARE BY BOARD POLICY WHAT THE

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.210
IMPACT IS TO OTHER HIGHER ITS

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:53.245
INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREA?

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:56.515
SO DOES IT DETRACT FROM OTHER

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:57.549
OTHER -- INSTITUTIONS LIKE AND

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:59.985
HOW SAN DIEGO STATE IT AT ONE

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:02.221
TIME THE IMPACT IT HAD AN OFF

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:04.390
CAMPUS CENTER -- IN CHULA VISTA

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:06.425
SO WHAT ARE THE COSTS TO

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:08.193
MAINTAIN THAT AND CAN THEY

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:08.927
MAINTAIN IT ADEQUATELY.

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:10.496
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PALM

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:13.265
DESERT CAMPUS IS THE STUDENTS

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:14.266
GOING THERE -- WANT MORE

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:17.503
SERVICES AND OFTENTIMES BECAUSE

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:18.504
OF ADMINISTRATOR EFFICIENCIES

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.340
THE HEAD OF THE HOME CAMPUS WILL

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.208
SHARE RESOURCES SO IT MAY BE A

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:24.543
FACULTY IS COMMUTING.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.245
OR COUNSELORS COMMUTING

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:31.049
FINANCIAL A PERSON IS GOING FROM

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:33.452
ONE CAMP THE OTHER.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.753
BUT OTHER FACTORS OF THEY WOULD

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.554
CONSIDER IS.

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.288
WHAT'S THE IMPACT WITH THE

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.356
COMMUNITY IS A COMMUNITY

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:40.492
WELCOMING WHAT ARE THE COSTS TO

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.427
CITE THE FACILITY IN THAT

00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:42.528
COMMUNITY AS FAR AS TRAFFIC

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:46.198
IMPACTS -- ARE ARE THERE -- IS

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.033
THERE HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.635
STUDENTS WE'VE SEEN THAT IS A

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:50.869
FACTOR.

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:53.772
SO WILL WE BE ABLE -- TO SINCE

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:55.240
IT'S A SELF SUPPORT PROGRAM A

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.575
CONSTRUCT HOUSING IN THAT AREA

00:17:56.642 --> 00:17:57.276
FOR STUDENTS.

00:17:57.342 --> 00:18:01.513
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM -- TO TO

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.981
GET THROUGH GRADUATION AND AND

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:03.882
RETAIN OF STUDENTS [inaudible]

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:06.385
OF FOR THOSE HURT WHAT WITH THE

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:07.653
ACADEMIC DEGREE PROGRAMS THEY

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.755
WOULD OFFER.

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:11.523
SO WILL THEY BE ABLE TO ACT

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.624
OFFER A FULL COMPLEMENT OF

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.259
DEGREE PROGRAMS WHAT DOES THE

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:16.495
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFER.

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.564
VERSES THE A FOUR YEAR

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.365
INSTITUTION.

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.334
SO THAT'S PART OF THE THE

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.869
TYPICALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.704
OUR OFF CAMPUS CENTERS AS THEY

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.105
WOULD OFFER UPPER DIVISION

00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:28.407
SELECT COMMITTEE COFFIN

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:29.908
COMMITTEE COLLEGES OFFER LOWER

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:32.544
DIVISIONS SO HOW THAT.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.546
WORKS AS WELL SUBMIT DR IN IN

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:35.414
TERMS OF AND WE'RE TALKING

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:36.548
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NOW

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:37.182
IN TERMS OF YOUR STUDENT

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:41.453
POPULATION YOUR STUDENT BASE --

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.754
WHAT PERCENTAGE GENERALLY ARE

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:44.490
COMMUTERS AS OPPOSED TO

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.125
RESIDENTIAL STUDENTS DOES IT

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:47.693
DEPEND ON THE CAMPUS?

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.261
RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE ALL OF OUR

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.296
OFF CAMPUS CENTERS ARE COMMUTER

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:53.232
CAMPUSES.

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:54.867
ALTHOUGH THEIR PLANS IN SOME OF

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:57.603
THE MASTER PLAN TO FIGHT HOUSING.

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:59.204
AND THEN THE MAIN SEE ISSUE OF

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:00.806
INSTITUTIONS.

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:04.042
FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE OR SYMBOL TO

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.544
DENOTE OR DOES IT DEPEND ON THE

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:07.479
CAMPUS IT DOES DEPEND ON THE

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.213
CAMPUS.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.881
AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:10.616
COMMUTERS AND THE AMOUNT OF

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.851
HOUSING ON CAMPUS ALSO RANGES

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:15.053
FRESNO IS ON THE LOWER SIDE.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.722
I THINK PROBABLY CLOSER 210%

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:19.091
COMPARED TO A MARITIME ACADEMY

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:21.727
WHERE THE REQUIRED. TO LIVE ON

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:25.964
CAMPUS AT SAVE UPWARDS OF 50%

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:26.265
[inaudible]

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.533
CAPACITY.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:30.302
AND IF -- THE ADMINISTRATION

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:33.505
WERE INCLINED TO ADD A ANOTHER A

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:36.041
ANALYSIS TO THIS STUDY FOR

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:38.277
EXAMPLE OF WHETHER IT'S A

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:39.811
SATELLITE CAMPUS IN AN EXPANDED

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:43.448
SATELLITE CAMPUS OR A A NEW CSU

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.317
INSTITUTION IN CHULA VISTA HOW

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:45.984
MUCH.

00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:47.920
HOW MUCH WOULD THAT ADD TO THE?

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:48.987
PRICE TAG OF THE STUDY WOULD

00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:52.124
DOESN'T NECESSARILY DOUBLE IT

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.859
FROM TWO TO FOUR MILLION OR CAN

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:55.294
YOU ADD ANOTHER SITE TO THE

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:55.827
STUDY.

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:58.664
WAS IN THE TWO MILLION.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.632
OR IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FOR YOU

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.801
ALL TO SAY AT THIS POINT YEAH I

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:03.435
WOULD GUESS IT WOULD NOT DOUBLE

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:04.570
IT.

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:06.238
IF IT WAS THE BUT BUT IT IS A

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:07.439
DIFFERENT AREA SO AS FAR AS

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:09.007
LOOKING AT THE LAND.

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:11.009
AND SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS IT

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:13.045
IT COULD.

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:14.246
BUT THE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:14.713
BE MORE THAN DOUBLE.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.747
AND INFO AND IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:17.749
CASE SINCE CALIFORNIA STATE

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:18.917
UNIVERSITIES HAD A PRESENCE.

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:21.019
HAS A PRESENCE IN SAN DIEGO AND

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:22.621
AS HAVE APPARENTLY HAD A

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:23.855
PRESENCE IN CHULA VISTA WITH THE

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.624
SATELLITE OFF CAMPUS LOCATION

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:26.725
BEFORE.

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:29.094
THAT MIGHT SIMPLIFY THE ANALYSIS

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:33.031
A LITTLE BIT ANYWAY.

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:33.632
RIGHT SINCE THEY WERE SERVING

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:34.399
THEIR AT ONE POINT.

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:35.033
IT SHOULD MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.701
THAT.

00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:37.336
FOLKS ON THE FIRST FLOOR WILL

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:39.471
CONSIDER.

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:42.541
QUESTION ABSOLUTELY DELIVER

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:42.841
[inaudible]

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.276
GOOD MORNING.

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:45.077
I WANT TO TOUCH ON TWO THINGS

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:45.677
THAT WERE SAID STARVING OTHER

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:46.645
UNIVERSITIES AND A BILLION

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:48.747
DOLLARS SO BEING NEW TO THIS

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:49.915
PROCESS.

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:51.717
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE AS

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:52.985
A STATE WOULD NOT GIVE YOU THE

00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:53.952
MONEY.

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:55.020
AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:58.023
FROM THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES ONE

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.558
AND TWO IS YOUR THOUGHT THAT IT

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:02.227
WILL BE A BILLION DOLLARS TO GET

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.162
A NEW INSTITUTION UP AND RUNNING.

00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:05.130
WELL TO START OFF ON THE

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.298
OPERATING COST OF THINGS SO

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:07.966
ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT.

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.868
EVERY YEAR YOU PROVIDE US AN

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.269
APPROPRIATION OF SOME SORT RIGHT

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:12.504
WHETHER THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:14.373
INCREASE A SLIGHT INCREASE OR

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.475
WHATEVER THE CASES.

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.275
WHAT I MEANT BY STARVING IS IS

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:18.010
THAT THEN WE ALREADY HAVE

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:19.645
EXISTING TWENTY THREE CAMPUS?

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:22.781
AND THEY ALL HAVE VARIOUS GOALS

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:23.515
THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:25.083
ESPECIALLY ON ENROLLMENT RIGHT --

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.485
WE HAVE A LOT OF CAMPUSES THAT

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.086
ARE IMPACTED WOULD LOVE TO

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:29.054
EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.922
OFFER MORE ACCESS TO LOCAL

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:33.692
STUDENTS AND AND STUDENTS WRIT

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.527
LARGE ACROSS STATE.

00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:36.461
WHAT YOU END UP HAVING IS THAT

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:37.596
THE MORE CAMPUS IS THAT YOU HAVE

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:38.897
AN ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A BRAND

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.365
NEW CAMPUS?

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:41.633
YOU YOU REALLY HAVE TO JUGGLE

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.968
THAT THAT.

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:44.936
FEEDING OF YOUR TWENTY THREE

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:46.304
THEN TWENTY FOUR KIDS RIGHT AND

00:21:46.371 --> 00:21:47.973
YOU HAVE TO SPREAD A LIMITED

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.275
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS NEW TO

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:51.276
THE UNIVERSITY.

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:54.513
WE NEED MORE MONEY FROM US.

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:56.581
YES OKAY THAT'S PERRANCE WELL NO

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:57.683
OKAY GOOD GOOD AND THEN THE

00:21:57.749 --> 00:21:58.583
BILLION DOLLARS SPECIALLY

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.518
SPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW YOUR WHEN

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:01.687
YOU'RE HIRING ADDITIONAL FOLKS

00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:02.854
AND THEN IF THEIR SALARY

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:03.989
INCREASES SECOND RIGHT THERE'S

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.857
THAT DISTANCE A LARGER

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:07.759
UNIVERSITY MEANS OF LARGE COSTS

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:07.959
RIGHT.

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:09.428
TOTALLY MAKES SENSE THE BILLION

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:10.829
DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT IT COSTS TO

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:14.900
GET YOU SEE MERCED UP AND

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:17.335
RUNNING BUILT FALL -- FOR THEY

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:18.003
DID START WITH A SMALLER AMOUNT

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.204
JUST LIKE WE STARTED WITH

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:20.338
SMALLER DOLLARS IT CHANNEL

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:23.241
ISLANDS AND MONTEREY BAY AS WE

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:25.043
BUILD FACILITIES BASED ON

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.544
PROJECTED ENROLLMENT.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.380
BUT OVER THE COURSE OF TIME IT

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:29.948
EASIER SAID THEY'RE GOING MUCH

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.216
FASTER THAN CERTAINLY WORK WE

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:31.683
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.784
THAT BALANCING THE NEEDS OF THE

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:34.019
OTHER CAMPUSES YEAH I WOULD

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.887
THINK A IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:39.157
GATE IT WOULD PROBABLY BE CLOSE.

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:40.859
TO AB SEVENTY EIGHTY MILLION AS

00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:41.993
FAR AS INITIAL FACILITIES.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.595
DID WE GIVE YOU THE MONEY FOR

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:45.630
YOU SEE MORE SAID MEANING THE

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.165
STATE THERE ARE SOME THEY'VE

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:49.101
DONE SOME SELF FUNDING BUT ALSO

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:50.769
SOME PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:51.236
AND A LARGE AMOUNT.

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:51.903
OF THE CITY COMES BACK AND SAYS

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.940
A NEW CAMPUS IS WARRANTED IN

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:59.444
CHULA VISTA OR STANTON NO.

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:01.947
STOCKTON EXCUSE ME -- THEN WE

00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:02.814
WOULD NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:03.915
MONEY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:09.588
MONEY FOR THAT SEVENTY TO EIGHTY

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.523
MILLION A LOT.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.626
YES NOT A BILLION BUT A LOT.

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:15.727
OKAY GREAT THANK YOU WHAT WILL I

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.362
ASSUME YOU DO YOUR CAPITAL

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:18.563
PROJECTS WITH BINDING CAPACITY

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.066
DON'T YOU.

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:22.534
MOST RATES WHAT RECENTLY WE'VE

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:23.101
BEEN USING OUR OWN CAPACITY

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:24.836
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:27.105
WELL SO IF IF IF IF THE

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:28.306
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES AND

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:29.074
LEGISLATURE PROVES IN

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:29.741
CONJUNCTION WITH THE

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:30.575
ADMINISTRATION.

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:32.277
A NEW CAMPUS.

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:32.978
IT'S INCUMBENT ON THE

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:33.678
ADMINISTRATION OF THE

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:34.446
LEGISLATURE TO PROPERLY FUNDED

00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:35.180
BOTH IN TERMS OF OPERATING

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:35.614
REVENUE [inaudible]

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.350
AND SUPPORT FOR THE THE CAPITAL

00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:39.618
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE

00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:41.086
NECESSARY WHETHER IT'S YOUR OWN

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:43.288
BONDS OR SOME OTHER MEANS OF

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:44.990
FINANCING THE CAPITAL

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:47.459
IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT.

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:48.360
I DIDN'T IN THE GOVERNOR'S AT

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:49.461
OUR PROPOSAL TODAY GOVERNOR WE

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:51.797
REQUESTED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:53.465
IN PERMANENT BASE FUNDING FOR

00:23:53.532 --> 00:23:54.833
FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.535
SO IT WOULD IT WOULD NEED TO

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.869
INCREASE FROM THAT AMOUNT THE

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:00.005
GOVERNOR DID NOT SUPPORT THAT

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:01.840
BUT THAT WAS OUR REQUEST.

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:04.009
WELL AND OF COURSE THIS ISSUE IS

00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.310
SIMPLY A STUDY NOT.

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:06.711
TO TALKING ABOUT ESTABLISHING

00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:08.413
NEW CAMPUSES.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.182
MY QUESTION WAS IF IF THE

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.918
ADMINISTRATION IN THE

00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:14.986
LEGISLATURE -- WANT TO TRY TO

00:24:15.053 --> 00:24:15.921
ACCOMMODATE OUR COLLEAGUE AND

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:17.255
TAKE A LOOK AT WHETHER THERE

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:18.590
SHOULD BE AT LEAST A SATELLITE

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:19.825
CAMPUS IT'S NOT SOMETHING ELSE

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:21.560
CHULA VISTA.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.228
COULD THAT BE ADDED TO THE STUDY

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:24.930
AND I GUESS THE ANSWER IS YES.

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:25.897
AND THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.966
MUCH ADDITIONAL MONEY WOULD BE

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:30.101
REQUIRED AND IT'S NOT DOUBLING

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.237
BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE MORE

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:33.405
THAN THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:36.942
CURRENTLY PROPOSED.

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:38.810
MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY JUST MAIL

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:39.845
ABSOLUTELY -- JUST TO PROVIDE A

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:41.313
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AS WELL

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:42.280
FOR THE PROPOSAL THE

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:44.282
ADMINISTRATION IDENTIFIED THE

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.718
SAN JOAQUIN AREA SPECIFICALLY

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:48.687
FOR THIS PROPOSAL -- LARGELY

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:51.489
BECAUSE OF A FEW DEMOGRAPHIC.

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:53.024
FACTORS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO ONE

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:54.759
BEING THAT REAL PERSONAL INCOME

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.595
IN THE EGION IS CONSIDERABLY

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:59.231
LOWER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE.

00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:01.800
AND ALSO THAT -- UNEMPLOYMENT IS

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:02.601
NEARLY DOUBLE THE STATEWIDE

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:04.769
AVERAGE THOSE ARE BASED ON

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:05.770
TWENTY SEVENTEEN INFORMATION.

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:08.206
WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN THAT REGION

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.941
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF HIGH

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.543
SCHOOL GRADUATES ALTHOUGH

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.211
THERE'S A LOWER THAN STATEWIDE

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:14.379
AVERAGE NUMBER THAT MEET

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.715
CRITERIA CURRENTLY FOR YOU SEE

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:17.883
OR CSU ADMISSION.

00:25:17.949 --> 00:25:19.150
THE PART OF THE RATIONALE IN

00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:21.286
LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL CAMPUS IN

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:23.488
THAT REGION WOULD BE WITH THE

00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:25.824
IDEA OF CONSIDERING WHETHER IT

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:26.958
WOULD HAVE.

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.927
ECONOMIC GROWTH BENEFITS IN THE

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:32.197
AREA WHETHER IT WOULD ALSO --

00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:34.132
LAND KIND OF THE CULTURE OF

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:36.735
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN THAT

00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:37.669
AREA AND KIND OF STOP SOME OF

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:38.970
THOSE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THAT

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:40.238
WERE CURRENTLY SEEING.

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:41.940
GRADUATING AT INCREASING NUMBERS

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:43.875
BUT NOT NECESSARILY CURRENTLY

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.810
MEETING THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:48.947
THAT WE WOULD LOOK FOR OUR FOUR

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:51.316
YEAR INSTITUTIONS -- REGARDING

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:53.785
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT ADDING

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.220
POTENTIALLY CHULA VISTA TO THE

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:56.187
STUDY BUT SOMETHING THAT WE

00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:57.088
WOULD NEED TO TAKE BACK BECAUSE

00:25:57.155 --> 00:25:58.089
AT THIS POINT.

00:25:58.156 --> 00:25:59.391
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS AS YOU

00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:00.225
KNOW FOR THE PROPOSAL

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:01.960
SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED SAN

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:03.495
JOAQUIN BUT WE CAN TAKE THAT

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:04.596
REQUEST BACK.

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:05.964
AND AS YOU MENTIONED WERE NOT

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.432
PRESUPPOSING IN THE PROPOSAL

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:09.668
THAT THERE WOULD BE A NEW CAMPUS

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:11.136
ASSEMBLY THAT WOULD BE A STUDY

00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:12.270
TO EXAMINE.

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:13.772
THE POTENTIAL MERITS OF HAVING A

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:16.141
CAMPUS AND THE DETAILS OF WHAT

00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:17.776
CRITERIA WOULD BE EXAMINED AS

00:26:17.842 --> 00:26:19.411
PART OF THAT STUDY WILL BE

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:20.445
FORTHCOMING.

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:21.413
WITHIN A REVISION IN THE BUDGET

00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:23.248
BILL LANGUAGE BUT CERTAINLY ONE

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:25.350
ASPECT WE WOULD EXPECT TO LOOK

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:26.851
AT WOULD BE THE FINANCIAL

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.453
IMPLICATIONS IF THERE THERE WERE

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.921
TO BE A NEW CAMPUS PROPOSED.

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.423
WELL CLEARLY THERE A LOT OF

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:32.924
NEEDS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN.

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:34.025
OF THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:37.562
MIND THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:40.632
OF THEM WHETHER IT'S FINANCIALLY --

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:43.401
PRACTICAL AT THIS TIME.

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:44.736
THAT'S WHAT THE STUDIES GOING TO

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:45.870
GOING TO REFLECT AND REVEAL

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:48.039
ALONG WITH THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:49.107
THAT YOU -- YOU REFERENCED BUT

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:50.175
PERHAPS YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:52.077
SINCE WE'VE HAD A COLLEAGUE WHO

00:26:52.143 --> 00:26:54.079
IS RAISE THE CHILDREN'S.

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:57.749
TO ISSUE. ONE ADDITIONAL COSTS

00:26:57.816 --> 00:27:00.251
THAT WOULD -- WOOD.

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:01.152
WHAT ADDITIONAL COST WOULD

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:02.954
RESULT FROM ADDING THAT TO THE

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:04.990
STUDY? TO DETERMINE YES OR NO

00:27:05.056 --> 00:27:07.192
HOURS OF THE CAMPUS RECITAL

00:27:07.258 --> 00:27:09.861
LIGHT IS THERE A NEED -- NOT

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:10.929
THAT THAT'S AN ADMINISTRATION

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:12.063
PROPOSAL BUT I WOULD BE

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.331
INTERESTED.

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:15.600
IN HAVING SOME IDEA FROM FROM

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:17.702
FINANCES TO WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:19.004
THAT WOULD ADD TO THE TO THE

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.605
PROCESS I CAN CERTAINLY TAKE

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:21.940

EXCELLENT TO THE PRESENTATION I

00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:29.314
LOOK FORWARD -- TO THE RESULTS

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:30.815
OF THE STUDY.

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:41.426
THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.328
IF YOU SEARCH SIX IS A HOLD OPEN

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:43.895
ITEM WE WILL REVISIT THAT.

00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:45.630
AT A LATER DATE LET'S GO BACK TO

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:48.266
THE BEGINNING OF THE AGENDA

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.568
WE'RE AGAIN WE'RE ON ITEM SIX

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:51.169
SIX ONE ZERO CALIFORNIA STATE

UNIVERSITY ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:56.775
BUDGET OPERATION.

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:57.809
THAT THE SAME TEAM OKAY WHO

00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:00.345
WANTS TO PRESENT.

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:01.446

AS DISCUSSED IN A PREVIOUS

00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:38.950
HEARING THE SIGNIFICANT OVERALL.

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:40.351
ADJUSTMENT THAT'S PROPOSED FOR

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:42.220
THE CSU IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:43.688
COMES WITH AN ADMINISTRATION

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:45.490
EXPECTATION THAT TUITION REMAIN

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:48.059
FLAT.

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:48.660
FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE

00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:53.565
ACCESS INCREASES AND THAT TIME.

00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:54.566
TO AGREE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.

00:28:54.632 --> 00:28:55.433
WE'RE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.535
JANUARY BOARD OF TRUSTEES

00:28:57.602 --> 00:28:58.736
MEETING CHANCELLOR WHITE

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.472
ANNOUNCED THAT TUITION WILL

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:03.908
REMAIN FLAT AT THE CSU.

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:05.009
FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND I

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.811
AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:09.747
THANK YOU.

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:13.585
WITH RESPECT -- TO SUPPLEMENTAL

00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:15.220
TUITION CHARGE IN ESSENCE THE

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:16.855
NON RESIDENT TUITION AND THE

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.656
ISSUE.

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:21.259
HOW IS THAT -- HOW IS THAT

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:23.628
HANDLED IN TERMS OF?

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.063
BEING DISTRIBUTED IS IT RETAINED

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.731
ON THE CAMPUS WHICH GENERATED OR

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.733
DOES IT GO INTO THE SYSTEM AND

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.768
THEN IS IT RE DISTRIBUTED. TO

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:31.569
ALL THE CAMPUS IS BECAUSE I

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:32.804
ASSUME WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:34.539
THAT THERE.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.774
ARE SOME -- SEE ISSUE

00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:38.977
INSTITUTIONS TO DRAW MORE NON

00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:42.113
RESIDENT STUDENTS AND OTHERS ARE

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.616
YOUR ASSUMPTIONS CORRECT ON ON

00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:46.851
AS HAVING MORE NON RESIDENTS AT

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:47.352
SOME GAPS IN THE OTHER.

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:49.087
I'D WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.022
CAMPUS -- COLLECTS THAT TO WITH

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:51.823
THAT SUBLIMINAL TUITION REVENUE

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.958
AND RETAINS IT AND USE THAT TO

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:54.559
EDUCATE THE STUDENTS THAT THEY

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:57.862
ARE -- EDUCATING ON NONRESIDENT

00:29:57.929 --> 00:30:00.064
STUDENTS.

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.599
WE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE IT TO IN

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.001
THE UC SYSTEM AS WELL IT'S IT'S

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:03.801
SORT OF FASCINATED ME.

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:05.770
BECAUSE THE THE MARGINAL COST OF

00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:07.238
EDUCATING THE STUDENT IS

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:08.907
PROBABLY THE SAME.

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.375
DOESN'T COST ANYMORE AN EDUCATED

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:12.177
NON RESIDENT SOMEBODY FROM

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:13.511
ARIZONA THAN IT DOES FROM

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:15.446
CALIFORNIA I ASSUME. FOR DOING

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:17.949
THE ADMISSIONS PROPERLY.

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:20.151
AND SO THERE'S A DELTA THERE AND

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:21.686
AND I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:23.888
EQUITY IN IN TERMS OF ALLOWING

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:26.057
CAMPUSES TO RETAIN THE DELTA

00:30:26.124 --> 00:30:28.860
JUST BECAUSE THEY OR ON THE

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:30.662
COASTER NEAR BEECHER PERHAPS

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:33.831
HAVE A SPECIALTY PROGRAM THAT.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:35.567
THE TRACKS NONRESIDENT STUDENTS

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:40.104
WERE AS PERHAPS FRESNO WERE.

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.472
SAMBAR DINO OR SOMEWHERE ELSE

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:42.974
DOESN'T.

00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:44.309
COULDYOU COMMENT A WELL IT'S

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:46.110
IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY ADDED

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:47.545
THROUGH THIS REALLY REALLY A

00:30:47.612 --> 00:30:49.814
TRICKY SITUATION -- SO IF WE GO

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:51.549
BACK MANY DECADES AGO THE WAIT

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:53.351
TO SEE ISSUE WAS STRUCTURED AND

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.186
FUNDED.

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:58.823
WAS AND A MODEL IN WHICH

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.024
WHATEVER TYPE OF PROGRAM YOU

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:02.327
OFFERED WOULD BE FUNDED BY THIS

00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:03.461
BY THE MINISTRATION AND THE

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.697
LEGISLATURE.

00:31:05.763 --> 00:31:09.067
ON A KIND OF A A TYPE OF DEGREE

00:31:09.133 --> 00:31:10.702
SORT OF FUNDING LEVEL SO IF

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:12.237
ENGINEERING WAS MORE EXPENSIVE

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:13.972
THE C. SHE WOULD RECEIVE A TOUCH

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:16.741
MORE MONEY. TO TO PAY FOR AN

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:19.077
ENGINEERING MORE ADDITIONAL ARE

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:20.745
ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING SLOTS

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.947
PERSON MAY DISABLE A LIBERAL

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:23.881
ARTS SORT OF DEGREE.

00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:26.351
SO THAT WAS A MODEL UP UNTIL

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:26.951
NINETY THREE NINETY FOUR TIME

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:28.253
FRAME.

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.921
THEN -- BECAUSE OF A SERIES OF

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:30.788
RECESSIONS THAT OCCURRED

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:31.689
INCLUDING THAT THAT ONE IN THE

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:33.191
EARLY NINETIES.

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:34.959
THERE WAS REALLY AID A DRIVE IN

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:36.794
THE SHIFT FROM THE STATE AS WELL

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:37.428
AS FROM THE C. ISSUES

00:31:37.495 --> 00:31:39.430
PERSPECTIVE TO SHIFT TO MORE OF

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:41.065
WHAT WE CALL INCIDENT INPUT

00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:42.634
MODEL WHAT WE HAD BEFORE MORE OF

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.334
A REVENUE MODEL WHERE.

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.402
WHATEVER THE STATE COULD PROVIDE

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:45.903
IN TERMS OF FUNDING OF THE

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.639
UNIVERSITY THERE IS AN AVERAGE

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:48.806
AMOUNT OF FUNDING ON A PER

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:51.009
STUDENT BASIS THAT WAS PROVIDED

00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:52.243
TO THE UNIVERSITY. TO THAT

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.778
EDUCATE A WHOLE VARIETY OF

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:56.247
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO HE

00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:57.415
RECEIVED.

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:59.317
WHAT WE CALL THE MARGINAL COST

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:01.185
OF ADDITIONS -- FUNDING.

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:02.253
WHICH YOU SEE IN YOUR IN YOUR IN

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.988
YOUR AGENDA.

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:04.956
THERE'S AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:06.224
FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED TO

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:08.192
SERVE ANY AND ALL TYPES OF

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.460
DEGREES GRADUATE.

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:11.296
DEGREES AS WELL AS UNDERGRADUATE

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.563
DEGREES RIGHT.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.233
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE --

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.203
TO THEN -- ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:19.804
TO CAMPUSES AND THEY HAVE TO

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.072
MAKE A DETERMINATION BASED ON

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:22.507
THAT FUNDING WHETHER THEY'RE

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:25.576
ABLE TO OFFER -- YOU KNOW MORE

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.779
ENGINEERING WITH THAT FUNDING OR

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:29.881
MORE LIBERAL ARTS.

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:30.515
SORTS OF PROGRAMS THAT SORT OF

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:31.215
THING.

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:33.851
NOBODY COMES DOWN -- TO THE IDEA

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:36.754
OF REGION ALLERGY AND THOSE

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.990
SORTS OF THINGS -- IT ALSO IS

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:40.658
VERY TRICKY RIGHT BECAUSE COSTS

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:43.027
ARE HIGHER IN DIFFERENT AREAS --

00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:45.229
BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE DO -- IS

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:47.432
IS ON AVERAGE -- YOU KNOW LIKE

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:48.833
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.636
AN AVERAGE.

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:53.771
COST PER STUDENT -- SOMEWHERE

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:55.406
BETWEEN FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:56.274
THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS IS YOU

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:57.008
KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE NON

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:58.443
RESIDENT RESIDENT STUDENTS.

00:32:58.509 --> 00:33:00.211
AND THAT'S ACROSS ALL MODES IN

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:02.880
LEVELS AND THAT KIND OF THING.

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:04.349
AND SO ESSENTIALLY GETTING TO

00:33:04.415 --> 00:33:05.917
YOUR POINT OF THE NON RESIDENT

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.151
NON RESIDENT.

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:10.588
TUITION BOTH THE SYSTEM WIDE

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:11.556
TUITION AMOUNT WHICH EVERY

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:14.125
STUDENT PACE FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.993
FORTY TWO PLUS THE SUPPLEMENTAL.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.528
THE NONRESIDENT PACE THAT

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:20.198
ESSENTIALLY COVERS -- THEIR

00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:22.233
THEIR EDUCATION -- SO THAT YOU

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.202
DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE

00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:26.204
STATE IS AT ALL SUBSIDIZING NON

FOR POLICY DEBATE I GUESS BUT IT

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:39.617
DOES INTEREST ME BECAUSE YOU

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:41.919

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:42.620
OF FIGURING OUT WHAT YOUR MA

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.789

EXPENSIVE THAN FRESNO THEN.

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:50.595
YOU COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

DELTA.

00:33:59.737 --> 00:34:00.772
BETWEEN WHAT THE A NON RESIDENT

EDUCATING THAT STUDENT IS.

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:06.477
WHETHER IT'S ENGINEERING OR

SPREADING THE NON RESIDENT DELTA

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:29.367

SITUATION AT UC THAT'S CORRECT

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:40.705

TOMORROW YEAH I I JUST HAVE A

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:48.312
QUESTION ON ON PAY HOW DOES THE

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:51.249
CSU COMPARE AND PAY TWO YEAR --

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:56.020
PROFESSORS TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES.

00:35:56.087 --> 00:36:01.192
WELL WHAT WE DO -- IS WE THAT'S

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:03.027
A HARD QUESTION ANSWER.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:05.062
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:05.596
IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WILL

00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:07.365
DISAGREE -- ON HOW I WOULD

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:08.699
ANSWER PER PERHAPS.

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:11.636
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING I'LL SAY

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:12.937
HOW WE HANDLE IT FROM A SYSTEM

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.071
MY PERSPECTIVE.

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:15.139
WHICH IS OUR ATTEMPT IS TO

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:17.041
ALWAYS TRY OUR BEST TO PROVIDE

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:18.776
ADDITIONAL SALARY INCREASES TO

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:21.412
OUR FACULTY AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:22.980
TO KEEP THEM COMPETITIVE IN THE

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:25.182
FIELD BUT AND ALSO KEEP THEM AT

00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:25.750
A AT A POINT WHERE THEY CAN

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.084
ACTUALLY.

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:28.553
I LIVE IN THE AREAS IN WHICH

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:30.621
THEY LIVE -- AND AND I AND I

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:31.822
JUST ABOUT THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:33.491
THERE ARE I'M SURE PLENTY OF

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:35.459
FACULTY MEMBERS THAT WILL SAY

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:37.061
WELL I TEACH IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:37.662
AND THAT'S COULD BE MORE

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:39.196
EXPENSIVE THAN WHEN YOU'RE

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:40.798
TEACHING MAYBE AN INTERLOCK KIND

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:41.899
OF A THING.

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:45.169
I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING --

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:46.904
WHAT ARE -- COLLECTIVE

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.739
BARGAINING TEAM AT THIS AT THE

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:49.840
CHANCES OFFICE RESIDUES ALWAYS

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:52.843
TRIES -- TO DO INTERNAL ANALYSES

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.178
ABOUT WHERE ARE.

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:57.448
OUR PROFESSORS RANK IN TERMS OF

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:57.748
THE MARKET.

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:58.716
OKAY.

00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:01.185
AND ONE THING THAT -- OUR

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:04.121
STRUCTURE ALLOWS IS FOR CAMPUSES

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:06.123
TO ATTRACT FACULTY AT THE

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.959
SALARIES THAT WILL ATTRACT THEM

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:09.927
TO THAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS -- AND

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:12.396
SO.

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:14.065
GENERALLY SPEAKING.

00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:15.933
I I REALLY CAN'T SAY WHETHER.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.401
SEE ISSUE.

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:18.669
FACULTY ARE PAID BETTER THAN

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:20.838
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR YOU SEE

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:21.939
BECAUSE IT'S LARGER CAN BE

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:24.008
DEPENDED ON THAT PARTICULAR

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:27.211
FACULTY MEMBERS -- PREFERENCE I

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:29.013
MEAN AT THAT PARTICULAR FACULTY

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.182
MEMBERS -- POSITION IN TERMS

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:31.649
THEIR HIRING.

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.117
AND I REALLY DON'T HAVE THE DATA

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:34.418
THAT WOULD CROSS WALK OUT

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:37.622
BETWEEN -- ALL THE SEGMENTS

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:39.557
WOULD YOU HAVE WOULD YOU HAVE

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:41.592
ANY DATA LIKE THIS IN HIS COUNTY

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.996
MY COUNTY RIVERSIDE USERS COUPLE

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:47.965
SEE ISSUES THERE AS WELL AS A

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:51.302
NUMBER PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES AND

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:52.403
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WOULD

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.038
THEY'RE ALL.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:55.373
ECONOMICALLY OUTLINED PROBABLY

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.441
THE SAME HOUSING PRICES WHICH HE

00:37:57.508 --> 00:37:58.876
SAID WOULD YOU HAVE ANY.

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:00.244
EMPIRICAL DATA ON OUT I DON'T

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:01.212
HAVE IT AT HAND RIGHT NOW BUT I

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:01.746
COULD ALWAYS PROVIDE SOME

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:02.913
INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.849
LATER ON IF YOU LIKE YEAH I I I

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:07.351
JUST WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT --

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:08.753
HOW'S YOUR RETENTION WHICH A

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:09.320
RETENTION RATE.

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:11.255
WELL I BELIEVE EVERY YEAR IF I

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.189
REMEMBER CORRECTLY -- THERE ARE

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:15.693
ABOUT SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED TEN

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.496
YEAR TENURE TRACK FACULTY.

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:20.364
ODDS OF PERSONNEL THAT.

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:20.898
RETIRE SEPARATE FROM THE

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.701
UNIVERSITY -- SO WHAT WE DO IS

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:26.003
THAT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY EVERY YEAR

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.072
ATTEMPTING TO TRY.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:28.906
TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS BACKED

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:29.940
OFFICE POSITIONS AS AS THEY

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:33.344
LEAVE -- AND GENERALLY -- OVER

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:35.146
THE LAST I THINK THREE TO FIVE

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:38.816
YEARS -- WE HAVE GAINED ON NET

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:41.052
ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MORE --

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:42.787
TENURE TENURE TRACK FACULTY --

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:46.590
SO WE ARE LOSING FACULTY TO

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.059
OTHER INSTITUTIONS OR TO

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:50.528
RETIREMENT BUT WE ARE -- WE'RE

00:38:50.594 --> 00:38:53.297
ALSO BACK FEELING AND AND ADDING

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:53.931
TO ONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS THAT

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:56.133
WERE KEENLY AWARE OF IN TRYING

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.502
TO MARRY OUR FACULTY TO IS THE

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:01.038
OUR GRADUATION ISSUE OF TWENTY

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:01.939
TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS THE NOTION

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.207
THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO OFFER

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:05.509
ADDITIONAL COURSES FOR ALL OF

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:07.778
OUR ALL OF OUR CURRENTLY.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.046
ENROLLED STUDENTS SO THEY CAN

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:11.315
TAKE ADDITIONAL COURSES SO THEY

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:12.483
CAN GRADUATE.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.918
IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER IF THEY

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:14.351
CHOOSE.

00:39:14.418 --> 00:39:16.253
SO ONE OF THE BIG EFFORTS YOU'LL

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.788
HEAR ABOUT LATER IS THAT

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:19.323
GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND PART

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.092
OF THAT IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF

00:39:21.158 --> 00:39:22.593
THAT IS HIRING OF ADDITIONAL

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.762
FACULTY ABOVE AND BEYOND THE

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:27.398
RING SO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:29.200
DO YOU USE -- COMPARATIVE AND

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:31.702

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:34.071
IN A IN TERMS OF SETTING SALARY

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:35.306
SCHEDULES FOR YOUR FACULTY.

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:38.476

TERMS OF DISCUSSING THAT ON IN

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:43.447
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- I THINK

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:46.751
IT WILL DEPEND UPON -- APART ON

00:39:46.817 --> 00:39:47.985
A CASE BY CASE BASIS ON THE

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.286
CAMPUSES.

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:52.056
ABOUT THEIR PARTICULAR HIRING

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:54.792
PRACTICES BUT I I DON'T HAVE

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.427
ANYTHING AND FOR ME THAT I CAN I

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:59.063

CSU.

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:16.580
AND UC COMPARED TO PEER

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.649
INSTITUTIONS SO FOR CSU WE

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:21.418

00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:23.154
TENURED TENURE TRACK FACULTY

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.723
SALARIES COMPARED.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.058
TO OTHER PUBLIC MASTERS LEVEL

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:28.626
INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:29.794
COUNTRY.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.697
AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT CSU --

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:35.232
ARE ON AVERAGE HAD HIGHER

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:37.368
SALARIES NOW THAT'S COMPARED TO

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:39.003
OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LESS

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:41.071
EXPENSIVE PLACES LIKE IOWA BUT

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:43.240
THEY THEY TEND TO BE HIGHER WE

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.141
CAN GET YOU THAT.

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:46.076
WE WE JUST HAD A PUBLICATION IN

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:48.279
JANUARY THAT INCLUDED.

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:49.246
OTHERS DATA.

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:52.850
WITH REGARD TO RETENTION.

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.084
THE ONLY THING I'M AWARE OF IS

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:56.487
BACK IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:58.322
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

00:40:58.389 --> 00:40:59.657
PRESENT A DID A COMPENSATION

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:01.826
STUDY AND PRESENTED ON THAT AT A

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:03.160
BOARD MEETING AND WHAT THEY

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:04.461
FOUND WAS THAT.

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:07.231
RETENTION RATES AMONG FACULTY ON

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.799
AVERAGE WERE LOWER THAN PEER

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:10.267
INSTITUTIONS AND THAT THEY WERE

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:12.036
GENERALLY ABLE TO ATTRACT A

00:41:12.102 --> 00:41:14.271
COMPETITIVE POOL OF CANDIDATES

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:16.574
AND HIRE WHO THEY WANTED TO HIRE.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.776
A SAID THAT WAS THE LAST A STUDY

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:20.544
I'M AWARE OF I I KNOW THAT.

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:22.012
CSU PERIODICALLY DOES THESE

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.514
SORTS OF STUDIES TO SEE WHERE

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:25.049
THEY STAND RELATIVE TO THEIR

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:27.151
PEERS IN THAT CAN HELP INFORM

00:41:27.218 --> 00:41:28.552
THEIR BARGAINING COLLECTIVE

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:31.889
BARGAINING -- PROCESS SEES.

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:32.857
INTERESTING BUT IT'S SOMETHING

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:35.159
THAT WE DON'T YOU KNOW REGULARLY --

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:36.727
GO TO THE BOARD EVERY YEAR WITH

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:37.995
AND AND INFORM THEM OF IT'S IT'S

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:39.663
SOMETHING THAT WE PERIODICALLY

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.599
DO AS NEEDED.

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:43.901
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:46.070
LET'S MOVE ON TO WERE ISSUE

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:48.172
NUMBER TWO OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.307
HOLD OPEN ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:52.910
ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:53.878
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SIXTY

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:55.379
TWO MILLION ON GOING GENERAL

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:57.748
FUND TO SUPPORT 2% ENROLLMENT

00:41:57.815 --> 00:42:00.284
GROWTH AT THE CSU WHICH IS

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.685
EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:04.955
SEVEN NEARLY ACTUALLY SAY.

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:05.589
SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED FULL TIME

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:06.824
EQUIVALENT STUDENT.

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:14.265
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:16.734
JOINT MERE PROCEED IF YOU WOULD

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.368
SIR THAT WOULD BE FINE YES SO

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:18.802
ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS JUST ONE OF

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.371
THE FUNDAMENTAL -- ISSUES THAT

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:23.007
THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO DECIDE

00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:25.409
ON EVERY YEAR -- LEGISLATURE

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:26.877
REALLY HAS SEVERAL FACTORS TO

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:28.579
CONSIDER THIS YEAR WHEN

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:29.847
DETERMINING.

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:30.848
THE LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:34.518
FUNDING TO PROVIDE CSU.

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:35.119
FIRST TO ANSWER INTERESTINGLY

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:37.087
THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:37.855
GRADUATES.

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:39.056
IN THE STATE IS ACTUALLY

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:41.926
PROJECTED TO DECREASE SLIGHTLY.

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.727
THIS YEAR ARE WHICH WOULD MEAN

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:45.329
THAT ALL OF THE THING ST EQUAL

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.563
ENROLLMENT DEMAND FOR FRESHMAN

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.533
ADMISSION IN THE FALL.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.703
FALL.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:53.237
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILL

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:54.638
DECREASE SLIGHTLY AS WELL.

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:57.675
OF NOTE HOWEVER IS THAT CSU IS

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.643
BEEN DRAWING FROM WELL BEYOND

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.011
THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:03.314
FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY POLICY

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.249
WHICH LIMITS FRESHMAN ADMISSION

00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:08.218
TO THE TOP 33% OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:09.286
GRADUATES.

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:11.221
LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:12.690
LEARNED THAT CSU HAD BEEN DRYING

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.892
FROM JUST OVER 40% OF THE HIGH

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:15.926
SCHOOL GRADUATES THAT WAS DONE

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:18.028
THROUGH A STUDY THAT THE

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.029
LEGISLATURE FUNDED.

00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:20.764
ARE AN UPDATED INFORMATION FROM

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:22.199
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:25.002
EDUCATION SUGGEST THAT CSU IS

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:28.305
LIKELY DRAWING FROM A EVEN

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:29.873
LARGER POOL TODAY.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.210
THE LIKELY DUE IN PART TO THE

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:33.911
DRYING FROM.

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:34.778
BEYOND ITS TRADITIONAL

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:37.047
ELIGIBILITY POOL IN FALL TWO

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:39.316
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ABOUT NINETEEN

00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:39.917
THOUSAND FRESHMAN APPLICANTS

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:42.219
PLUS AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:44.188
THOUSAND TRANSFER APPLICANTS.

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:45.756
MET CS USE MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:47.257
REQUIREMENTS BUT WERE NOT

00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:49.860
ACCEPTED AT ANY.

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:53.030
CSU CAMPUS TO WHICH THEY APPLIED.

00:43:53.097 --> 00:43:55.566
AND AS PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR GENDER

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:57.601
NOTE SEIZE APPLICANTS ARE KNOWN

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.737
AS DENIED ELIGIBLES THEY DIDN'T

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:00.938
GET IN ANYWHERE IT CSU EVEN IF

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:01.805
THERE WAS JUST ONE CAMPUS THEY

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.974
APPLIED TO THEY WOULD BE

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.109
CONSIDERED IT'S NIGHT ELIGIBLE

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:07.411
WITH THEM BUT THAT THAT'S THE

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.746
PROBLEM WITH THE STATISTIC RIGHT.

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:09.780
I MEAN IF I APPLY.

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:12.883
TO SAN DIEGO STATE AND DON'T GET

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.218
IN.

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:15.119
I AM A DESIGN ELIGIBLE EVEN

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.186
THOUGH.

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:16.954
I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:18.389
REDIRECTION POLICYTHAT YOU'RE

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:19.390
IMPLEMENTING EVEN THOUGH I

00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:20.858
PERHAPS COULD HAVE BEEN AND

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.259
ADMITTED TO SEMBRA DINO OR

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.727
FRESNO WERE.

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:25.396
CHANNEL ISLANDS ARE MONTEREY BAY

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:26.663
RIGHT THAT THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.831
RIGHT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THE

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:30.634
LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE IS.

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:32.703
IS INFORMATION ON WHETHER THE

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:36.874
STUDENTS APPLIED TO A CAMPUS

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:37.441
BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR NEAREST

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:38.642
CAMP.

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:40.544
AND THEY WERE IN THAT REGION IN

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:42.112
THAT AREA THEY MIGHT BE ACROSS

00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.180
THE STREET FROM SAN DIEGO STATE

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:44.815
IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GO

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:45.416
ANYWHERE ELSE.

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:47.017
LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE THAT

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.652
INFORMATION ALL WE HAVE IS THAT

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:50.921
WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:51.422
STUDENTS.

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:53.323
ARE THAT APPLIED LAST YEAR THEY

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.426
DIDN'T GET IN INTO ANY CAMPUS

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:56.627
AND SOME CASES.

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.495
ARE YOU HAD YOU SEE STUDENTS

00:44:58.562 --> 00:44:59.096
WERE APPLYING DOUBLE DOUBLE

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:01.432
CAMPUSES A LOT OF CASES THOUGH

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:03.367
IT'S APPLYING TO JUST ONE CAMPUS

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:05.402
MICHAEL LONG BEACH OR SAN DIEGO.

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:07.471
CAN WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.440
THAT STUDENTS FROM THE IT WOULD

00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:10.741
BE MORE TROUBLING IF THAT

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:12.976
STUDENT WAS OF A LOCAL STUDENTS.

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.178
AND JUST COULDN'T GET IN DESPITE

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:17.047
MEETING THAT MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:17.748
REQUIREMENTS [inaudible]

00:45:17.815 --> 00:45:19.149
SO.

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.250
KNOWING THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE OF

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:21.485
OF DENIED ELIGIBLES THE

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:22.286
LEGISLATURE.

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:22.953
MIGHT WISH TO PROVIDE ENROLLMENT

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.621
GROWTH TO TRY TO BRING DOWN.

00:45:24.688 --> 00:45:26.423
THAT THAT UMBER THAT THIRTY

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.925
THOUSAND OR SO NUMBER.

00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:30.094
IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.595
DECIDE TO DO THAT.

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:33.130
WE WOULD RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:35.065
MAKE IT CLEAR TO CSU WHAT THE

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:37.067
INTENTIONS ARE TO TO ADDRESS

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:38.235
THIS ISSUE OF TONIGHT ELIGIBLES

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:39.436
THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:41.672
CSU KNOWING THAT.

00:45:41.738 --> 00:45:43.373
THEY CAN BETTER TARGET IN

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.209
CONCENTRATED ROMAN GROWTH FUNDS

00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:47.211
IN THE CAMPUSES AND PROGRAMS.

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:50.380
THE HIGHEST ANNETTE ENROLLMENT

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:51.582
DEMAND.

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:53.584
AND AND AND BECAUSE OF THE

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.352
THIRTY THOUSAND THE DECLINE IN

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.121
WHAT HI HIGH SCHOOL ENROLLMENT

00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:59.123
FOR EXAMPLE WE SEE.

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:01.391
IS REALLY NOT A RELEVANT.

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.227
STATISTIC IS AND WE'VE GOT

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.728
THIRTY THOUSAND FOLKS WHO.

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.630
CLEARLY.

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.398
MADE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:09.766
AND ARE TRYING TO GET INTO SEE

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:11.635
ISSUE. ONE POINT ONE PHASE POINT

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.170
OR THE OTHER AND HAVE NOT BEEN

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:15.038
ABLE TO DO SO.

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:16.073
AT LEAST THE SCHOOLS WERE THEY

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.074
APPLIED.

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:19.009
WE'LL HAVE A CLEARER IDEA ONCE

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:21.111
WE GET THIS RE DIRECTION POLICY

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:22.913
IN PLACE MAYBE SOMEONE COULD

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.847
YEAH I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:25.616
KNOW THAT'S THAT'S THE THE

00:46:25.682 --> 00:46:27.384
SEGWAY REALLY IT TO THE CSU

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.819
CHANCES OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:29.686
THEIR NEW.

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:31.355
AUTOMATIC REDIRECTION POLICY

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:32.890
THAT THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING RIGHT

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.158
NOW AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:35.526
WAS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:37.995
LEGISLATURE SO -- THEY'LL BE

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:39.563
ABLE TO SPEAK.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.231
TO THE REDIRECTION POLICY AND

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:42.132
ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:45.536
LEGISLATURE TO KEEP IN MIND.

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:47.371
I END OF REALLY MONITOR WHAT

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:48.672
ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHETHER TO THE

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.040
EXTENT TO WHICH STUDENTS WHO ARE

MORE DIVERSE.

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:45.555
CAMPUSES MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:47.524

INSTITUTIONS SO ABOUT THIRTY

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:27.617
THOUSAND BETTER DENIED ELIGIBLE

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:29.886
A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:32.288
BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND OTHER

INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE STATE.

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:41.297
BUT AS PART OF THE ROLL OUT OF

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:42.999
THIS RE DIRECTION POLICY.

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:44.634
I I YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO BE

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.002

SCHOOL TO WHICH THEY'VE BEEN

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:58.681
REDIRECTED -- WILL THERE BE SOME

00:56:58.748 --> 00:56:59.849
REFINED -- DATA ANALYSIS AND

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:00.884
WILL THERE BE A REPORT THAT

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.620

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:05.088
TELL US HOW THIS PROP PROCESS IS

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:06.055
WORKING OF THIS PROGRAM IS

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:06.289
WORKING.

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:07.624
MAKES SENSE.

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.125
YES I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:10.160
CALLED FOR IN THE BUDGET

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.327
LANGUAGE BUT I'M SURE IF IT WAS

00:57:11.394 --> 00:57:12.695
REQUESTED WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:14.697
PRODUCE THAT ONCE WE HAVE FINAL

00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:15.765
NUMBERS.

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.400
AFTER FALL NIGHT OF FALLS OUT

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:19.636
FALL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:21.104
CENSUS GREEN BECAUSE IT WOULD

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:22.372
SEEM TO ME WHETHER WE GET IT OR

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:24.174
NOT YOU WOULD WANT IT RIGHT YOU

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.175
WANT TO KNOW.

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:27.410
HOW MANY OF THESE STUDENTS THAT

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:28.511
HAVE BEEN REDIRECTED ACTUALLY

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:31.114
ENROLL IN THE SCHOOL TO WHICH

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.916
THEY'VE BEEN RE DIRECTED?

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:34.551
YES BECAUSE WE NEED.

00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:36.419
TO OF REDIRECTION IS NOT JUST A

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:38.121
AN INITIAL TIME PERIOD BECAUSE

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.522
WE NEED TO NOW SUPPORT THAT

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:40.857
INCREASE ENROLLMENT AT THE

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:42.325
CAMPUSES THAT THEY ACTUALLY

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:43.593
ENROLLED SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.528
TO SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS OVER

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.997
THE FOUR YEARS OF THEIR DEGREE

00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:49.666
REQUIREMENTS AS FRESHMEN OR TWO

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:50.934
YEARS AS TRANSFER.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.970
STUDENTS SO WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.205
HOW.

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:55.972
WE WANT TO UNDER BETTER

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:58.341
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.309
FOR DEMAND SO WE CAN HELP

00:57:59.375 --> 00:58:01.744
CAMPUSES PLAN CORRECTLY IN THEIR

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.780
ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:04.714
WITH THE CAMPUS IS THAT WILL BE

00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:06.850
ACCEPTING THE RE DIRECTED

00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:07.550
APPLICANT.

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:08.618
RIGHT AND IF THERE IF THE IF FOR

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:11.221
EXAMPLE THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:13.923
THE 20% OF THE STUDENTS WHO WERE

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.458
REDIRECTED.

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:16.759
TO FRESNO DIDNOT OR MAYBE

00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:18.361
THAT'S NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE CHICO

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:20.763
OR SOMEWHERE DID NOT IN ROLE

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.398
THERE THEN I WOULD THINK. TO THE

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:23.499
EXTENT THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN A

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:25.168
FURTHER ANALYSIS YOU WOULD WANT

00:58:25.235 --> 00:58:26.369
TO KNOW WHY NOT.

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:27.971
BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S A MARKETING

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:29.339
EFFORT.

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:31.274
IT IDEALLY GIVEN THE COST OF

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.976
HIGHER EDUCATION WE WANT A

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:34.077
MAXIMA AND THE COST OF

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:35.979
FACILITIES AND ALL THE REST OF

00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:36.579
IT.

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:38.648
WE WOULD WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:40.016
CAPACITY WE HAVE IT ALL OVER

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.618
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:43.152
CAMPUSES TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.888
STUDENTS TO FILL THE HOLES AND

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.956
FILL THE GAPS AND FILL THE SEATS.

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.691
WERE THERE ARE SEATS STILL TO BE

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.193
FILLED SO I'M JUST CURIOUS YES

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.394
SIR WHAT CAN I ADD A LITTLE BIT

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:55.365
ABOUT ABOUT THIS SO -- SO APRIL

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:55.965
TALKING FROM THE VANTAGE POINT

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:57.700
OF GETTING AS MANY THE STUDENTS

00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:58.868
ARE ELIGIBLE OUT TO THE CAMPUSES

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:00.670
THAT HAVE SOME CAPACITY.

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:01.938
THE ONE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.306
GOING FORWARD WITH THIS IS THAT

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:04.941
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:06.109
WILL TAKE US UP ON THIS

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:07.744
REDIRECTION OFFER.

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:10.480
ON TOP OF THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:11.114
GOOD STE.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.749
WE DON'T HAVE A SOLID STREAM OF

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:14.083
FUNDING.

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:17.253
AVAILABLE -- TO SUPPORT AND AND

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.489
AND AND AND A SIGNIFICANT

00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:21.357
INCREASE ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

00:59:21.424 --> 00:59:22.558
IF A NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS SAY

00:59:22.625 --> 00:59:24.360
IF FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM ARE

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:25.395
RE DIRECTED.

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:28.164
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF SPOTS OR

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:29.565
HANDFUL SPOTS ON SOME CAMPUSES

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:30.700
WHERE THEY ARE UNDER THEIR

00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:32.368
FUNDED ENROLLMENT TARGETS

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:33.236
MEETING THERE'S THERE'S FUNDING

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:34.203
THAT IS ON THAT CAMPUS THAT

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:35.238
COULD.

00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:36.940
ACTUALLY EDUCATE THOSE

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.408
ADDITIONAL SUITS AT SHOPPING GET

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:40.643
TO THAT FUNDED PERFECT.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:41.811
FUNDED TARGET LEVEL.

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:42.345
IF WE HAVE A LOT MORE THE

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.213
STUDENTS.

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.114
END UP LANDING ON SOMEBODY'S RE

00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:46.149
DIRECT CAMPUS WE HAVE TO FIND A

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:47.216
WAY TO PAY FOR THAT ADDITIONAL

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:49.185
ACCESS. ONE OF THOSE WAYS THAT

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.387
WE HAVE PLANNED FOR IS TO USE

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:52.855
THE ONE TIME ENROLLMENT FUNDING

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:54.090
THAT WAS PROVIDING THE BUDGET

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:55.358
LAST YEAR.

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:57.593
LAST YEAR RECEIVED RIGHT ABOUT A

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:58.194
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:58.895
WE STILL HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:00.330
MILLION OF THAT THAT WE WOULD BE

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.832
ABLE TO TEMPORARILY.

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:03.933
SUPPORT THE STUDENTS FINANCIALLY

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.070
FOR THEIR FOR THEIR COURSES

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:07.704
THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES THAT SORT

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:08.237
OF THING.

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:08.905
BUT THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE ARE

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.406
VERY NERVOUS ABOUT WITH THIS

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:11.240
REDUCTION POLICY IS.

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:13.776
WHILE THE WELL WE DID HAVE A

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.345
REDIRECTION POLICY SET UP FOR

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.813
THE AT T. STUDENTS AND THERE ARE

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:18.448
VERY FEW OF THEM THAT TOOK US UP

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.949
ON THAT RE DIRECTION OFFER.

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:22.418
WE OUGHT WE DO BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:23.686
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS WE WE'D

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:24.687
WE'D WE'RE NOT SURE WE'RE

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.723
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MANY OF THE

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.257
STUDENTS WILL ARRIVE -- THAT

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.325
WILL TAKE US UP ON THAT RE

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:30.760
DIRECTION OFFER AND AND HOW WE

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:33.162
CAN SUSTAIN THEM NOT ONLY IN IN

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:35.131
A SHORT TERM BASIS FOR THOSE ONE

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:35.865
TIME MONIES BUT OVER THE LONG

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.266
HAUL.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.301
THAT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE IN IRAQ

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:39.302
INCLUDING UNDERSTAND IT BUT I

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:41.671
ALSO AND I ALSO THINK THAT -- WE

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:42.638
NEED TO HAVE SOME ONGOING

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:43.606
CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.341
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THAT

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:48.011
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME BUDGETING

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:50.380
ISSUE THAT YOU WILL FACE ANYWAY

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:52.815
WHERE.

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:56.185
YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD PLAN.

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.453
THE WAY WE BUDGET FOR HIGHER

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.388
EDUCATION WITHOUT HAVING SOME

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:01.557
SORT OF FUND.

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:02.425
THE KIDS SORT OF FLOATED IN AND

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.559
PROVIDE MONEY THROUGH

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:04.961
CONTINGENCIES FOR YOU.

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:05.795
THIS IS AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS ONE

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:06.462
BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE DON'T HAVE

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:10.767
THE DATA -- TO REALLY DO

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:11.367
ACCURATE PLANNING.

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:13.202
BUT WILL THE DIRECTION.

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.471
AS OF YET FIRST YEAR RIGHT RIGHT

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:16.639
NOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE THOUGH IS

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.141
THAT THE OF THE FUNDING THAT HAS

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.275
BEEN PROPOSED BY THE

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.910
ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE.

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.445
ALLOCATED IN ROLE THAT

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.414
ENROLLMENT OF 2%.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.883
ABOUT TO US SEVENTY THREE

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:27.483
HUNDRED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:29.152
STUDENTS WE HAVE ALLOCATED THAT

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:31.421
OUT TO ALL THE CAMPUSES.

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.556
RIGHT WE'VE WE'VE SPREAD THAT TO

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:34.557
THAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.325
AND TOLD THEM IF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.861
PROPOSAL HOLDS YOU SANTA SPADE

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:40.063
HAVING THE ABILITY SERVE AN

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:41.097
ADDITIONAL SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:41.631
STUDENTS.

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:44.734
THAT MAY CUT DOWN ON THE NUMBER

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:48.304
OF REDIRECTED FROM YOU KNOW

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.505
THOSE PEOPLE WHO APPLY TO FRESNO

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:50.373
STATE.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.474
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.341
CAPACITY THAN FRESNO STATE SO

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:53.976
THAT MAYBE THEY ARE HAVING TO BE

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:57.280
RE DIRECTED SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.714
SO WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP.

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.950
WE MAY BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.753
FISCAL IMPACTS WITH AN F. THE

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.489
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED 2% HOLDS.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.757
AND THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:08.791
THE ONE TIME FUNDS TO A KIND OF

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:11.194
BRIDGE ANY ADDITIONAL STUDENTS

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.962
AND THEN REVISITED AND EVERY

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:14.931
VISIT LATER RIGHT ON REGIONAL

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:15.932
SUBSEQUENT YEARS RIGHT.

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:17.100
GOOD VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I MEAN

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.534
IF YOU BELIEVE THE FOLKS AT TO

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:21.337
TALK ON THESE ISSUES THEY SAY WE

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.772
NEED ANOTHER MILLION.

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.307
BACHELOR'S DEGREE EMPLOYEES IN

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:25.241
THE WORK FORCE AND I THOUGHT

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:26.642
THAT DATE WAS TWENTY THIRTY I

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.077
COULD BE WRONG ON THAT IF THAT'S

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:29.278
THE CASE.

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.881
WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO FILL THE

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:33.216
SEATS IN THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.084
CAPACITY AND WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:37.553
OUT WHERE TO GET THE MONEY. TO

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.154
TO DO THAT IF THE STUDENTS ARE

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:42.792
WILLING. TO GO TO CHICO OR

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:45.027
MONTEREY BAY CHANNEL ISLANDS SO

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.462
ENDED TALK ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:48.965
ISSUE VERY BRIEFLY -- OBVIOUSLY

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.533
SEE ISSUE AT ITS SCALE AND SIZE

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.369
WE MAKE ABOUT HALF OF THE

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.805
DEGREES THAT NEED TO BE EARNED

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.406
BY THAT TWENTY THIRTY DEADLINE.

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:59.542
AND SO WHAT OUR PLAN IS IS -- TO

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.910
FOLD.

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:03.679
THAT WE CAN BRING MORE DEGREES

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.314
TO CALIFORNIA THROUGH OUR

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.849
GRADUATION ISSUE OF EFFORTS SO

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.818
THAT NEEDS TO BE FUNDED OVER TH

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:09.485
SIX YEAR SPAN.

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:11.921
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS A

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:12.455
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT ON

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.590
ENROLLMENT -- ON APRIL SIDE

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:16.058
RIGHT THAT WE ANTICIPATE THAT

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.660
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ADD UPWARDS

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:19.862
OF 5% OF NEW ENROLLMENT PER YEAR

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:22.765
IN THE VERY NEXT TWO THREE FOUR

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:23.199
YEARS.

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:24.800
IN ORDER TO TO NOT ONLY HAVE

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.869
GREATER THROUGHPUT OF OUR

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:28.070
EXISTING GROUPS IT'S BETTER THAN

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.338
ALSO YOU AFTER HALF MORE

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:30.506
STUDENTS.

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.074
THAT ARE EARNING DEGREES BETTER

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.010
NOT HAVING ACCESS TO UNIVERSITY

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:34.810
RIGHT NOW.

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.179
SO WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THAT

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.014
WITH OUR BUDGET ASKING THAT'S

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.349
WHY YOU SEE US A CONSISTENTLY

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.151
COMING TO THE TO THE TO THE

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:43.519
CAPITAL REQUESTING GRAD ISSUE

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:44.353
FUNDING.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.354
AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL IN ROME

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:46.389
THE FUNDING ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:47.957
5% INCREASE I'M COMPLETELY

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:50.092
COGNIZANT OF THE DELTA BETWEEN

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.762
THE THE PROPOSAL AND AND THE

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.497
REQUEST AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:57.200
ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION WITH

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.067
THE WITH ALL.

01:03:58.134 --> 01:03:59.902
STAKEHOLDERS POSI ISSUE IN THE

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.304
ADMINISTRATION ON HOW WE SORT OF

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.705
CLOSE THAT GAP OF THE CRITICAL

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:04.574
ISSUES. FOR INTERESTED IN

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.274
MEETING THE NEED WE'RE GONNA

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:06.175
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT TO GET MORE

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.778
PEOPLE GRADUATED WE'RE GONNA

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:09.378
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:12.515
MORE FOLKS -- IN THE PROGRAM'S

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.417
FALL WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.118
BUDGETARY CHALLENGES SO WE'RE

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:18.521
GOING TO WORK ON THAT.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.089
ONLINE MA'AM YOU MENTIONED JUST

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.958
ONE OTHER QUESTION ONLINE

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:23.259
EDUCATION I WAS PLEASED TO SEE

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:27.029
THAT REFERENCED IN YOUR REMARKS.

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:28.264
AND I KNOW THAT SEE ISSUE IS

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:29.332
STEPPING OUT SMARTLY IN THE AREA

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.667
OF ONLINE EDUCATION.

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.169
ARE YOU ABLE TO IS.

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:34.770
WITHIN YOUR SYSTEM.

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.806
CAMPUS TO CAMPUS IS THEIR CROSS

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.741
UTILIZATION OF ONLINE EDUCATION

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:43.112
SO IF I'M AT CHANNEL ISLANDS.

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:45.615
AND THERE'S AN ONLINE COURSE IT --

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:46.549
SEVEN CISCO OR ONE OF YOUR OTHER

THAT IN IS HOW USER FRIENDLY IS

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.488
THAT SYSTEM IF I AM.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:53.389
SO WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:56.459
CALLED CSU FULLY ONLINE IT WAS

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:59.395
FIRST STARTED I BELIEVE IN TWO

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:00.463
THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN BASED

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:01.864
ON AB.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:02.798
THREE EIGHTY SIX AND HAT THAT

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:06.202
PROGRAM ALLOWS IS FOR STUDENTS --

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.570
TO THAT OUR CURRENT STUDENTS AT

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:10.039
ONE CAMPUS BE ABLE TO REVIEW ALL

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.574
ONLINE OFFERINGS BY OTHER

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.542
CAMPUSES THEY DO HAVE TO MEET

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:15.645
CERTAIN CRITERIA SO THEY HAD TO

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:17.213
HAVE AT LEAST ATTENDED TWELVE

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:17.813
UNITS.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.082
AND ALSO HAVE A A TWO POINT OH

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:22.685
GPA NOT BE AN ACADEMIC TROUBLE

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.120
BEFORE THEY START AN ONLINE

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:26.989
CLASS BUT THESE CLASSES WERE --

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:29.025
HELP ACTUALLY DEVELOPED USUALLY

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:30.559
SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS ANY TYPE

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.061
OF BOTTLE NECK OR DEGREE

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:33.963
REQUIREMENTS THAT STUDENTS HAVE

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.398
THAT THEY CAN'T GET AT THEIR OWN

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:36.532
CAMPUS.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.167
SO WE HAVE MADE A CONCERTED

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.802
EFFORT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:41.704
YEARS TO FURTHER PROMOTE THAT

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.775
PROGRAM AND ALSO -- REDO THE

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:47.610
WEBSITE THAT STUDENTS USED TO

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.245
MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY TO BE

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:50.913
ABLE TO SEARCH ACROSS THE

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.014
CAMPUSES.

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:54.016
IF A STUDENT DOES FIND A COURSE

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.885
THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THEY

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:57.753
CAN ACTUALLY ENROLL FOR THAT

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:42.791
SO OVERALL CSU SHOWING

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.727
IMPROVEMENT IN A NUMBER OF AREAS --

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:45.861
PERTAINING TO STUDENT

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:46.528
PERFORMANCE AND IF THE

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:47.162
LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO CONTINUE

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.863
SUPPORTING THE GRADUATION

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.431
INITIATIVE GOING FORWARD WE

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:53.335
RECOMMENDED LINK FUNDING -- FOR

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:54.169
FOR THE INITIATIVE TO AN

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.105
EXPECTATION THAT CSU CONTINUE TO

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:57.740
MAKE PROGRESS.

01:12:57.806 --> 01:13:00.042
IN THESE KEY AREAS YOU KNOW AND

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:02.377
GRADUATION RATES NARROWING

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:03.212
ACHIEVEMENT CRACKED GAPS.

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:05.848
BECOMING MORE EFFICIENT BY

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:07.716
REDUCING EXCESS UNITS. ONE WAY

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:08.450
CSU COULD CREATE A BETTER

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.352
INCENTIVE FOR STUDENTS TO AVOID

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.054
ACCESS UNIT ACCUMULATION AND

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.056
MAXIMIZE AID FOR OTHER STUDENTS

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:16.658
WOULD BE TO MODIFY A POLICY.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:17.926
ARE THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE ON

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:21.163
THEIR INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAM

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:24.266
STATE UNIVERSITY GRANTS.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.068
CURRENTLY STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE A

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:26.735
CSU GRANT FOR UP TO ONE HUNDRED

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:29.238
AND FIFTY UNITS WHICH IS ONE

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:30.973
FOUR YEARS WORTH OF UNITS BEYOND

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.142
WHAT A STUDENT TYPICALLY NEEDS

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:33.909
TO GRADUATE WITH A BACHELOR'S

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:34.943
DEGREE.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.712
BY CONTRAST STATE LAW LIMITS CAL

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:38.046
GRANTS THE STATE FUNDED CAL

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:40.149
GRANTS TO FOUR YEARS OF FULL

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:40.716
TIME.

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.918
ATTENDANCE OR ITS EQUIVALENT

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:45.187
WHICH IS A HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.889
ANOTHER WAY FOR CSU TO FURTHER

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:47.956
REDUCE ACCESS UNITS WOULD BE TO

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:49.124
LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TIMES A

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.259
STUDENT CAN.

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:54.029
TAKE AND REPEAT A COURSE. FOR

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:56.532
BETTER GRADE -- MOST CAMPUSES

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:57.166
ALLOW STUDENTS TO TAKE THE SAME

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:59.535
COURSE FOR UP TO THREE TIMES

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.036
STUDENTS TYPICALLY ARE ALLOWED

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.271
TO REPEAT UP TO TWENTY EIGHT

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:04.606
UNITS OF COURSE WORK IN THIS WAY.

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:05.874
WE RECOMMEND ENACTMENT OF A

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.309
SYSTEM WIDE POLICY THAT LIMITS

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.811
STUDENTS TO TAKING THE SAME

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:11.046
COURSE FOR BETTER GRAY TWO TIMES.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.714
WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALREADY THE

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:15.350
POLICY AT A NUMBER OF OF CSU

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.118
CAMPUSES.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:16.819
AND I ACTUALLY I KNOW I KNOW

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:18.821
YOU'RE FROM GIVEN WHERE YOU'RE

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:21.223
FROM US CAL STATE SAN BERNARDINO

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.992
IS LOOKING AT REDUCING CURRENTLY

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:25.327
THEY ALLOW STUDENTS TO TAKE A

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.429
COURSE THREE TIMES FOR A BETTER

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.664
GRAY AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:30.232
REDUCING NEXT TO SO THIS IS

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.868
SIMILAR TO WHAT SALMON A DINO.

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:35.804
IS LOOKING TO DO -- AND GIVEN

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:36.371
THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:37.840
DOESN'T CURRENTLY COLLECTED ON

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.675
UNITS ACCUMULATED DURING TO DO

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:41.310
TO COURSE REPETITION THE

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:42.845
LEGISLATURE COULD REQUIRE CS YOU

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.112
REPORT THIS DATA.

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:45.514
AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.050
PERFORMANCE REPORT THAT OUR

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:50.252
RELEASES IN MARCH TYPICALLY

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:50.552
[inaudible]

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:51.019
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:52.988
WELL.

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:55.023
GIVEN THE FACT THAT I'M AS OLD

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.892
AS METHUSELAH -- HIGH -- THIS

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.428
CONCEPT OF TAKING COURSES TWO OR

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:00.896
THREE TIMES TO GET A BETTER

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:05.033
GRADE IS -- SOMETHING THAT I'D

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.735
NEVER HEARD OF UNTIL I CAME TO

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:09.104
CALIFORNIA SO.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.205
BUT OF COURSE SAID YOU KNOW I

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:11.573
WENT TO SCHOOL IN THE DARK AGES

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.741
AND I DON'T REMEMBER BEING ABLE

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:14.710
TO DO THAT.

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.011
OR MAYBE I TO HAVE A BETTER

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.312
CAREER SOMEWHERE.

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:18.413
CAN CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT IS THAT

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.215
A REAL PROBLEM HERE IN THE STATE

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:21.783
I MEAN I DON'T I DON'T.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:24.419
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND -- MAYBE

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:25.921
DID SO WELL THAT YOU DON'T NEED

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.589
A CLATTER HAVING YOUR APPEARING

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:29.157
OVERLY KIND -- I DON'T

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:31.727
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS WELL

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:32.361
SO I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO A LOT

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:33.228
OF GIVEN THE BUDGETARY

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:34.696
CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:38.533
FACT THAT WE HAVE CAMPUS IS THAT --

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.936
CLOGGED UP IMPACTED AS WE SAY

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:43.038
AND TRYING TO GET STUDENTS AND

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.307
SEATS AND MEET THE MILLION.

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.109
BACHELOR'S DEGREE SHORT TARGET

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.411
BY TWENTY THIRTY YOU WE NEED THE

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.880
SORT OF FIGURE OUT IS A IS A BE

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:53.415
GOOD ENOUGH OR DO I NEED TO HAVE

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.517
AN A AND YEAH THAT TYPICALLY

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:56.618
DOES NOT HAPPEN AND I WOULD SAY

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:58.754
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS OF

01:15:58.820 --> 01:15:59.187
ALL OF THE ISSUES.

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:00.489
WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE LOOKING

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:02.324
AT SCARCITY OF ACROSS

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.459
ENROLLMENTS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:05.661
AND ALSO WITH COURSE TASTING

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:06.929
COURSE COURSE TAKING WERE YOU

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.363
KNOW WE HAVE ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.731
REALLY LOOKING AT THAT KNOWING

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:12.467
THAT IF YOU TAKE EXTRA COURSES --

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.068
YOU MAY BE TAKING THE SEAT OF

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.770
SOMEONE ELSE ESSENTIALLY SO

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:15.437
THERE IS SOME INSTANCES OF

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:17.306
STUDENTS REPEATING A COURSE FOR

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:19.341
EXAMPLE IN AN AREA THAT'S VERY

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:20.842
COMPETITIVE LIKE NURSING.

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.511
BUT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:23.545
THAT WE USED TO HAVE ON THAT

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:25.314
WHEN THE PREVALENCE OF THAT HAS

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.615
GONE DOWN TREMENDOUSLY.

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.350
OUR CAMPUSES ARE REALLY MINDFUL

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.553
OF THE FACT THAT -- YEAH THEIR

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.021
POLICIES ARE LIMITED WHAT DO WE

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:34.623
HAVE SYSTEM WIDE DATA AND IF NOT --

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.257
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:36.591
TO TAKE A LOOK AT BECAUSE I

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:40.128
WOULD THINK THAT WOULD E OF

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:40.629
INTEREST CERTAINLY IS OF

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:43.932
INTEREST. TO ME AND AS LONG AS I

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:45.033
HAVE THIS ASSIGNMENT THIS BUDGET

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.501
SUBCOMMITTEE MAYBE THAT'LL AND

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.003
SOON -- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.304
WE NEED TO START COMPILING SOME

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:51.006
SYSTEM I DID IF IN FACT IT'S

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:52.874
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.242
FOR OUR AN ISSUE THAT'S

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:55.610
WIDESPREAD I'M NOT CALLING IT A

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:56.912
PROBLEM I MEAN IT'S JUST TO BE

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:59.481
CLEAR THE POLICY OF THE CAMPUSES.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:03.085
IS FOR STUDENTS THAT ET A THE

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:05.887
THAT FAIL WE'RE GONNA DE OR EVEN

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:07.656
A C. MINUS SO IF THEY GET A A C.

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:08.256
MINUS.

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:09.925
THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO REPEAT

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:11.693
THE COURSE IF THEY GET SAY

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.262
ANOTHER SEE MINUS A. B. L. LOUD

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:15.931
REPORT THE COURSE AGAIN

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:16.898
CURRENTLY IF THEY DO GET AN A OR

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:17.866
B. THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:19.468
REPEAT A COURSE FOR THE PROBLEM

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:20.802
CAMPUSES.

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:21.837
CAMPUSES I'VE SPOKEN WITH HAVE

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.038
HAVE IDENTIFIED AS THEIR NOT

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.740
DOING STUDENTS ANY FAVORS IF

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:31.113
THEY'RE THEY'RE FAILING THEY

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:32.447
TAKE A GANDER FAILING AGAIN.

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:33.849
THERE NEEDS TO BE A DISCUSSION

01:17:33.915 --> 01:17:34.850
ACTUALLY.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.985
HOPEFULLY EARLIER ON AND WHEN

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:37.886
THE STUDENT GETS SAID INITIAL

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:38.653
LAUGH ABOUT.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.689
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:41.256
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR STUDY

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.357
SKILS LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:43.592
MATH SKILLS -- OR ENGLISH SKILLS

01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:45.193
IS THIS REALLY THE RIGHT MAJOR

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.461
FOR YOU BUT IF IF YOU ALLOW THE

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:47.963
STUDENT TO FAIL.

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.364
FAIL AGAIN AND THEN TAKE IT A

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:53.135
THIRD TIME WHAT CAMPUSES.

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:55.437
ARE SAYING IS.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:56.071
NOT NECESSARILY DOING STUDENTS

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.205
AND WITH AN EXPLANATION AXES

01:17:57.272 --> 01:17:58.273
VERY VALUABLE TO ME SO FROM A

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.841
SYSTEM WIDE STANDPOINT I MEAN

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:01.843
WHAT.

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:02.577
THE THE SO THE POLICY ALLOWS

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:03.512
COURSES TO BE REPEATED BUT I

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:05.580
MEAN IS THERE SOME.

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.582
SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT THAT AND

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:09.584
THEN ATTACH IS TO THE STUDENT AT

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.353
THAT POINT.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.288
TO BRING ABOUT A BETTER OR MORE

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:14.990
SUCCESSFUL RESULT IN IN DO YOU

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.725
HAVE THE THE COUNSELING STAFF TO

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.727
DO THAT ARE YOU UNDER FUNDED DO

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:20.195
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT I MEAN.

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:21.863
THERE IT SEEMS TO ME THEN BASED

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:23.165
ON THAT EXPLANATION THAT THERE

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:24.499
ARE A WHOLE.

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.668
LEVEL A SERIES OF ISSUES THAN

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:28.370
THAT THE POP ON THE RADAR SCREEN

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:29.538
AND NEED TO BE ADDRESSED RIGHT

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:30.639
YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY IT AND

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:31.506
THAT'S PART OF MY LARGER

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:33.241
TESTIMONY ON THE INTENTIONALITY

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:34.709
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:36.078
THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE.

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.779
THIS IS ONE ISSUE I DON'T MEAN

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:39.047
TO MINIMIZE IT NO BUT WHEN YOU

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:41.383
TALK ABOUT -- EVERY ASPECT OF A

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.085
STUDENT'S ACADEMIC CAREER NOT TO

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.820
MENTION WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:45.954
THE CLASSROOM.

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:47.022

AS A SYSTEM SOME OF THE MOST

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:20.922
AMBITIOUS STUDENT SUCCESS

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:22.691

AND EQUITY GOALS SUCH THAT -- BY

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:25.327
THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WILL

FOUR YEAR PUBLIC COMPREHENSIVE

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.633
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE NATION.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:32.901
WITHOUT PEERS WHEN TALKING ABOUT

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.603
GRADUATION RATES AND WE'RE

01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:36.071
TALKING ABOUT COMPLETION SO WE

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:38.740

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.209
THRILLED TO PRESENT.

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:42.077
SOME REMARKABLE RESULTS THAT

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.812
WE'VE HAD SO FAR SO ACROSS THE

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.580
BOARD NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:46.615
OUR GRADUATION RATES WHETHER

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:48.383
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRST TIME

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.451
STUDENTS.

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:50.418
WE'RE TALKING MATTER TRANSFER

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:51.920
STUDENTS AND WHETHER YOU LOOKING

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:53.722
AT MALES FEMALES ALL GENDERS ALL

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:56.625
RACES WE ARE AT ALL TIME HIGHS

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:57.392
FOR COMPLETION RATES.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.927
I MEAN THIS IS REALLY REMARKABLE

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.395
IN HISTORY THE CSU THERE IS

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.930
CURRENTLY NO BETTER TIME TO BE A

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.565
STUDENT YOUR OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.267
SUCCESS IS GREATER NOW.

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.635
THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME WHICH IS

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:09.037
SIMPLY REMARKABLE AND AS MY

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:10.238
COLLEAGUE AT THE LA A A LA --

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.473
MENTION AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.608
THE INTENTIONALITY RASO LOOKING

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:16.144
DEEPLY AND TURNING EVERY STONE

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:16.778
IN TERMS OF EQUITY AND WHAT I

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:17.379
MEAN BY THAT IS WE'RE LOOKING

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:18.480
FOR OPPORTUNITIES.

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:20.282
IN THE CLASSROOM AND OUTSIDE OF

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.117
THE CLASSROOM TO IDENTIFY AREAS

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:24.019
THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IN A

01:20:24.085 --> 01:20:25.720
POSITIVE WAY AFFECT OUR MOST

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.522
UNDERSERVED STUDENTS OR STUDENTS

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:28.256
OF COLOR.

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:30.659
ARE LOW INCOME STUDENTS -- AND

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:31.526
THE SUCH AND SO IT'S BEEN A

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:33.695
REMARKABLE TRAJECTORY SO FAR I

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:34.663
CAN TALK ABOUT THE BIG NUMBERS

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:36.064
BUT BUT SPECIFICALLY YEAR OVER

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:38.967
YEAR. FOR THIS LAST YEAR FOR

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.168
WHICH WE HAVE DATA AND TING OVER

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:41.703
THE LINE OVER THE SUMMER WE

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.672
GRADUATED -- A HUNDRED AND SIX

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:44.839
THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES WHICH

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:46.875
WAS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:48.176
ADDITIONAL YEAR OVER YEAR FOR

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:50.045
THAT -- THE YEAR BEFORE IN TERMS

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.580
OF UNDERGRADS AND PUT THAT IN

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:52.214
PERSPECTIVE IT'S EASY FOR US TO

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.415
THROW AROUND BIG NUMBERS LIKE

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:56.017
THAT BUT SEVEN THOUSAND LIVES

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.519
SOME THOUSAND FAMILIES SEVEN

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:58.720
THOUSAND COMMUNITIES AND THEN

01:20:58.787 --> 01:20:59.354
THINK ABOUT THE RETURN TO THE

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.255
STATE.

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:01.256
AND SO THIS IS BUILDING UPON

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:02.958
YEARS AND YEARS OF THAT

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:11.132
INTENTIONALITY THAT I MENTIONED

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.901
A REALLY CHALLENGING OURSELVES --

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:13.435
TO BETTER FOR ALL OF OUR

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:14.903
STUDENTS AND IT'S REALLY

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.438
GRATIFYING TO SING THAT IT'S

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:17.639
PAYING OFF ACROSS ALL OUR

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:18.206
CAMPUSES.

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:19.007
SO YOU MAY ASK I ALWAYS ASK HOW

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.275
DO WE GET THERE IT WAS PART OF

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:21.343
THE DISCUSSION BEFORE THEIR THE

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:22.210
COMPLICATED ANSWER I TOUCHED A

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:22.811
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VARIATION

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:24.112
CAMPUS TO CAMPUSES.

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.280
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.514
THAT THAT THAT ARE -- EMPLOYING

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:27.882
DIFFERENT THINGS BUT MAYBE I'LL

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:29.117
JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON FOR HIGH

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.585
LEVEL ITEMS. ONE IS YOU MAY HAVE

A REALLY A WATERSHED MOMENT FOR

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:33.388
US IN TERMS OF OR ACADEMIC

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:34.456
PREPARATION POLICY.

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:36.091

YOU NEED TO TAKE REMEDIAL

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:44.966

IN THE FALL.

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:16.698
BUT LOOKING AT THE FIRST TERMS

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:19.301
WORTH OF DATA SO THIS LAST FALL --

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:20.802
IF YOU LOOK YEAR OVER YEAR IN A

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.704
COMPARISON LAST YEAR BEFORE THIS

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.040
POLICY WE HAD ABOUT A THOUSAND

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.174
STUDENTS WHO CAME TO US IN NEED.

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:29.010
OF EXTRA SUPPORT WHO --

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:30.612
COMPLETED A LITTLE LESS THAN A

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:33.782
THOUSAND WHO COMPLETED A COLLEGE

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.417
LEVEL MATH COURSE.

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.619
THIS YEAR THAT SAME GROUP OF A

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.421
UNDER -- THAT STUDENTS THAT WE

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:40.322

01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:41.089
THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:42.324
MATH COURSE RIGHT AWAY.

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:44.859
AND EIGHT TIMES THAT AMOUNT

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:45.760
ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS A

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:47.696
YEAR OVER YEAR COMPLETED THAT

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:48.930
FOR CREDIT MATH COURSE SO

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:49.631
THEY'RE NOT SPINNING THEIR

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:51.933
WHEELS THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY WITH

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:52.901
MOMENTUM TOWARDS THAT AGREES SO.

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.436
AGAIN INCREDIBLY PROUD OF OUR

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:56.338
CAMPUSES AND PARTICULARLY OF OUR

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:57.539
FACULTY FOR PULLING THAT

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:58.907
TOGETHER AT COMPLETED AN

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:00.642
ACCEPTABLE LEVEL THE COMPLETED

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.877
EXCEPT AT A COLLEGE LEVEL

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:05.013
COLLEGE ON THE MAP OR SO INSTEAD

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.181
OF TAKING A PRETTY BACCALAUREATE.

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:07.982
NON CREDIT COURSE THAT DID NOT

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:10.952
COUNT THESE ARE FOR CREDIT --

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.420
BOB GLORIA LEVEL COURSES IN

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:13.855
MATHEMATICS SO JUST TREMENDOUS

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.957
AGAIN THAT SUPPORT -- MEANT THAT

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:16.725
INTENTIONALITY AROUND --

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:17.292
SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS SO

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.827
THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF POLICIES

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:20.829
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SECOND

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:23.231
EXAMPLE IS REALLY LEADERSHIP --

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:24.032
I THE PLEASURE BEING UP HERE A

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:25.767
FEW WEEKS AGO FOR A PRE HEARING

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.502
AND JUST ANECDOTALLY FOLKS

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:28.937
AROUND THE TABLE WERE SAYING HOW

01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:30.338
ON THEIR CAMPUS VISITS THEY

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:32.240
NOTED THAT. TO A PERSON THAT

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:33.775
THEY MEET WITH THEY ARE TALKING

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:34.943
ABOUT THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE

01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:35.777
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SUPPORTING

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.479
STUDENTS IN WAYS THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:38.012
SEEN BEFORE.

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:39.347
SO I THINK THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:40.382
BY ACCIDENT THAT'S THE

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:42.183
LEADERSHIP ON CAMPUS THAT'S OUR

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:44.753
FACULTY REALLY BUYING INTO WHERE

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:45.620
WE'RE HEADED ITS COLLECTIVE

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.255
MOMENTUM.

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.189
THE THIRD THING I'LL MENTION IS

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:48.390
DATA.

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.724
WERE AT A POINT NOW WHERE WE ARE

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:53.395
COLLECTING A LOT OF DATA ON

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:55.397
IMPEDIMENTS TO STUDENT SUCCESS

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:55.897
AND ALSO AREAS OR THEIR

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:56.297
SUCCESSFUL.

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:57.499
ENSURING THAT BROADLY ACROSS THE

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:59.033
SYSTEM ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS WE

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.568
HAVE A SYSTEM DASHBOARD WERE

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.237
EVERY FACULTY MEMBER.

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:03.905
CAN LOOK AT THE COURSES THEY

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:06.241
TEACH IN THEIR MAJORS AND THEIR

01:24:06.307 --> 01:24:08.243
DEPARTMENTS AND SEE WHAT IS THE

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:09.577
GREAT DISTRIBUTION FOR STUDENTS

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:11.780
IN MY CLASS OR OTHER CLASSES ARE

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:13.148
THEIR EQUITY ISSUES ARE THERE

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.482
BIG DIFFERENCES. FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:17.051
THE GRADES THAT FIRST GENERATION

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:18.520
STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING VERSES

01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:20.321
THEIR PEERS AND IF SO HOW CAN I

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:21.589
LOOK UPON MYSELF. TO PERHAPS

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:22.857
CHANGE THE WAY I TEACHER PROVIDE

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:24.125
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:24.959
STUDENTS THEY'RE STARTING TO

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:33.735
HAVE REAL STRONG INTENTIONAL

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:36.237
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IMPROVEMENT.

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:38.106
THE LAST AREA HOW IS IT BEEN

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.941
RECEIVED I ASSUME.

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.276
FACULTY HAD TO BUY INTO THAT

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:42.043
HOW'S IT BEEN RECEIVED

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.611
INCREDIBLY WELL I'LL TELL YOU

01:24:43.678 --> 01:24:44.312
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES WE HAVE IS.

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:44.879
WE'RE SUCH A MISSION DRIVEN

01:24:44.946 --> 01:24:45.980
ORGANIZATION OUR FACULTY IN MANY

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.215
CASES COME TO US BECAUSE OF OUR

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:47.482
MISSION.

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:48.917
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO BETTER

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:50.351
BECAUSE OF THE STUDENTS WE SIR

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:51.286
AND SO PUTTING DATA IN FRONT OF

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.921
THEM THAT ARE PERSONAL TO THEM.

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:54.823
IN MANY CASES OPEN THEIR EYES

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:55.323
AND AND THEY'RE REALLY

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:57.425
APPRECIATIVE OF OF THAT

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.494
INFORMATION.

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:00.228
THE LAST THING I'LL JUST MENTION

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:01.429
IN CLOSING IS RESOURCES WE COULD

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:02.564
NOT BE WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH THE

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:03.198
RESULTS WE HAVE WITH OUR

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:03.998
RESOURCES AND WE'RE VERY

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:04.999
GRATEFUL FOR THE BUDGET -- THE

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:06.734
PROPOSED BUDGET AND THE LAST FEW

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:07.635
YEARS OF FUNDING THAT WE'VE HAD

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:08.403
IT'S A LOUDEST TO HIRE

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.939
ADDITIONAL TENURE TRACK FACULTY.

01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:11.806
IT'S ALLOWED US TO OPEN UP THE

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:12.640
NEEDED SECTIONS THE STUDENTS CAN

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:13.741
GET THE COURSES THEY NEED WHEN

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:14.876
THEY NEED THEM.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:15.877
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE ADVISERS

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:17.479
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY DOUBLE

01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:19.481
DOWN ON THE DATA INVESTMENTS IN

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:20.548
THE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS THAT

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:21.349
YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AS

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:22.283
WELL.

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:24.018
BUT I WILL SAY IF IT'S SOMETHING

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:26.621
I ALWAYS SAY THAT STUDENT

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:27.989
SUCCESS IS NOT FREE.

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:28.790
IT DOESN'T COME EASY THIS

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:30.892
PROGRESS -- IS IN JEOPARDY IF WE

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:31.493
DON'T GET FUNDING AND CONTINUE

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:32.494
FUNDING WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.662
OPEN THOSE COURSES -- YOU KNOW

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:36.264
AND I JUST SAY THAT AS I WAS

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:37.332
LISTENING TO THE HEARING AND

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:38.700
LISTENING A LITTLE BIT THIS

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:39.734
MORNING TO SOME OF THINGS THAT

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:40.668
WERE GOING ON I'M CONVINCED I'M

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:42.370
BIASED BUT I'M CONVINCED THAT

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:43.338
THERE'S NO BETTER INVESTMENT

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:47.175
THAN THAT -- AND INVESTMENT IN

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:49.077
THIS THE STUDENTS OF THE CSU

01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:51.145
WHAT CAN YOU -- THERE IS A DELTA

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:52.947
OF ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS --

01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:54.015
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:57.118
PROPOSAL FORTY FIVE AND WHAT THE

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:59.020
ISSUE RECEIVED IN THE PAST AT

01:25:59.087 --> 01:25:59.754
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.556
GRADUATION INITIATIVE.

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:02.857
WHAT IS THAT DELTA THE THIRTY

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:03.858
MILLION DOLLARS ACTUALLY

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:05.793
REPRESENT IN TERMS OF A

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:09.697
GRADUATION INITIATIVE?

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.232
PROGRAMS IN IMPACT IT'S A GOOD

01:26:11.299 --> 01:26:12.367
QUESTION THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:14.402
WITH THAT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:17.372
WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO LAUNCH AN

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:19.073
ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND SIX

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:19.707
HUNDRED COURSE ACTIONS WHICH IS

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:24.045
ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND OR SO --

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:26.014
THE YOU KNOW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.482
IN THE SECTIONS AND SO -- YOU

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:28.883
THIS IS REALLY PART ONE OF THE

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:30.652
COURT WITH IF YOU TALK TO

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.554
STUDENTS AND I KNOW MANY WILL

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.855
TESTIFY LATER. ONE OF THE

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:34.455
BIGGEST IMPEDIMENTS TO

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:36.224
GRADUATING FOR THEM IS NOT BEING

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:36.925
ABLE TO GET THE COURSES THEY

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:38.326
NEED WHEN THEY NEED THEM.

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:39.294
AND SO FOR US THIS IS HIRING THE

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:39.928
FACULTY THAT WE NEED TO HIGHER

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:42.030
SO THAT WHEN A STUDENT NEEDS OF

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:43.565
COURSE WE CAN MEET THEM WHEN

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:44.799
THEY ARE.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:45.800
AND OFF FROM THE COURSES THEY

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:46.834
AND THESE WOULD BE COURSES

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:47.869
OFFERED BOTH WHAT I WOULD CALL

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:49.637
DURING THE TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.940
YEAR OF SEPTEMBER THE JUNE AND

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.608
ALSO IN THE SUMMER SESSIONS AS

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:57.245
WELL ABSOLUTELY YEAH.

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:58.179
WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO

01:26:58.246 --> 01:26:59.581
MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:00.949
OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO THE

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:02.216
COURSES THEY NEED IN ORDER TO

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:03.451
GET OUT THE DOOR.

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:05.887
AND IT'S OUR OBLIGATION.

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:07.355
TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:09.958
PROPERLY RESOURCES SYSTEM SO WE

01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:10.959
ALLOW STUDENTS TO CROSS THE

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:12.393
FINISH LINE.

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:13.795
AND HOPEFULLY THE FINISH LINE ON

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:14.929
TARGET WHICH I KNOW IS WHAT

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.864
YOU'RE WORKING ON WHETHER IT'S A

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:20.101
SIX YEAR TURGOR FOR YOUR TARGET.

01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:21.836
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN TO

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:22.704
YOU AND I WE'RE WORST WERE

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:23.404
SINGING THE SAME TUNE HERE SO

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:24.672
WHEN WE SPEAK WITH THE CAMPUSES

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:26.874
WE SAY IT'S OUR JOB TO ADVOCATE

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:28.343
FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU'RE DOING.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:29.077
THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THERE

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:31.279
ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES AND TRY

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:31.846
TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:32.947
HELP OUR STUDENTS.

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.282
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:36.584
THE INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:40.655
PIECE THAT THE LA -- MENTIONED --

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:44.292
WITH THE SYSTEM ALLOWS -- THERE.

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:47.662
I I WOULD CALL TO DISCONNECT BUT

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:48.463
IT'S NOT A DISCONNECT WITH NO

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:50.231
ONE FAULT ANYONE FOR PROVIDING

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:51.666
STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID.

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.434
CERTAINLY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.235
BUT APPARENTLY THIS THE SYSTEM

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:55.403
PROVIDES INSTITUTIONAL

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:56.504
FINANCIALLY THAT EXCEEDS THE

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:58.272
PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE PROVIDE

01:27:58.339 --> 01:27:59.040
CAL GRANTS.

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:00.241
AND WE'RE TRYING TO ADD SOME CAL

01:28:00.308 --> 01:28:01.309
GRANT TIME TO THE PROCESS

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:02.710
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.612
ENOUGH RIGHT NOW TO GET PEOPLE

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:05.913
OUT THE DOOR BUT SEPARATE APART

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:07.148
FROM THAT CAN YOU ADDRESS THE

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:09.183
INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIALLY CALICO

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:10.118
YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S.

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:11.853
THAT'S ONE POLICY THAT WE'VE HAD

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:13.721
FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT'S ONE

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:15.523
THING THAT WE'VE BE

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.357
INSTITUTIONALLY AT FOR A LONG

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:17.058
PERIOD TIME JUST IN TERMS OF

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.393
BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE.

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.161
AS MUCH ACCESS AS WE CAN I THINK

01:28:20.228 --> 01:28:21.763
THE ONE THING THAT WE ARE

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:25.066
CONCERNED AND I I I'VE BEEN TO

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.267
JEFF WOULD AGREE WITH ME ON THIS.

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:29.804
AS ONE OF OUR GRADUATION ISSUES

01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:30.938
OURS IS THAT AND YOU GUYS ARE

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:33.007
BUT YOU'RE HERE CLOSE TO IT BUT

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:34.242
BUT THE ONE THING THAT -- IS

01:28:34.308 --> 01:28:37.345
ALWAYS SOMEWHAT -- PRECARIOUS IS

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:39.881
THE THE HARD -- STOP OF A OF A

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:41.849
CAL GRANT. FOUR YEARS OF

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:44.719
ELIGIBILITY PERIOD AND NO

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:45.820
SUMMERS.

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:50.024
IN NO SUMMER ONLY UNLESS YOU AND

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:52.727
TO SHOOT RIGHT.

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:53.327
NOW ALTHOUGH THE THE ONE THING

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:54.362
THAT WE TRY TO DO IS WE TRY TO

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:55.930
DO IN A WAY KIND OF A WRAPAROUND.

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:56.597
INTENTIONALITY WITH

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:57.999
INSTITUTIONALLY OUR STATE

01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:58.666
UNIVERSITY GRANT IN IN FACT SOME

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:00.468
INSTANCES WHERE STUDENTS HAVE

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:01.469
RUN OUT OF THEIR CAL GRANT

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:03.104
ELIGIBILITY.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.073
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUDGET.

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:06.541
PUT THEM OVER INTO OUR STATE

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:08.209
UNIVERSITY GRANT TO GET THEM

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:09.610
THROUGH BECAUSE ONE THING THE

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:11.713
THE THE I THINK THE ONE OF THE

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:12.747
GREATEST.

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:15.083
TRAGEDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:16.751
THOSE STUDENTS TO HAVE A HUNDRED

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:18.486
TEN UNITS THEY'VE COMPLETED OR

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.821
HUNDRED AND YOU KNOW TOWARDS

01:29:19.887 --> 01:29:21.222
DEGREE.

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:23.658
AND MAYBE BECAUSE OF TIME AND

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:24.892
COMMITTEE COLLEGE OR ANOTHER YOU

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:26.594
YOU KNOW.

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:27.662
LIVE STUDY.

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.497
THEY DECIDED TO USE FINANCIAL

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:30.631
AID AND AND THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:31.132
FINANCIAL AID.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.000
THAT'S ONE OF THE REAL KILLERS

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:34.368
WOULD BE IF THERE'S ALWAYS

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:35.903
INVESTMENT ONE BY THE STATE BY

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.038
THE STUDENT AND THENALL OF A

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:38.940
SUDDEN ALL OF THE FINANCIALLY

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:40.074
DRIES UP.

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:41.242
INCLUDING THE STATE UNIVERSITY

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:42.777
GRANTS WE WOULD BE VERY WE WILL

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:45.279
BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT WANTING

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:46.748
TO CHANGE THAT POLICY WELL YOU

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:49.117
AND I AND KEEP AND KEEP.

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:50.051
KEEP THINGS AFFORDABLE YOUR

01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:51.652
ATTORNEY CRITICISM FROM MAY IN

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:53.454
FACT -- YOU KNOW THOSE OF US UP

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:54.021
HERE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:55.323
BUILDING -- PROPONENTS OF

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:56.657
INCREASING RATHER THAN

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.392
DECREASING.

01:29:58.459 --> 01:29:59.494
STUDENT FINANCIAL AID IS NOT TO

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.528
SAY THAT THE LA WAS

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:02.096
RECOMMENDATION IS IS FINE TUNING

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:04.165
IS IS NOT WORTH FINE TUNING BUT

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:04.832
IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT TOO THOUGH

01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:08.202
WELL I'M THINKING THAT IT'S MORE

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:10.638
OF OF CHANGING THE FOCUS LATELY

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.306
IT SEEMS TO ME THE FOCUS IS NOT

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:13.174
ON THE AMOUNT.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:13.808
OF STUDENT AID OR THE LENGTH OF

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:14.308
IT.

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:14.909
IT'S ON THE COUNSELING THAT'S

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:16.477
PROVIDED TO STUDENTS TO TRY TO

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.479
KEEP THEM FOCUSED REDUCE EXCESS

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:19.947
UNIT ACCUMULATION.

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:21.649
FOCUS MOVING FORWARD IN A

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:24.051
STRAIGHT LINE FROM BEGINNING TO

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:26.554
END AND GRADUATION AS AS AS

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:28.389
EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:29.557
POSSIBLE.

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.425
NOT REDUCING NECESSARILY THE

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:32.260
STUDENT AID IT'S IT'S A

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:33.961
TESTAMENT TO THE SYSTEM THAT YOU

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:34.662
HAVE.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:36.030
INSTITUTIONALLY THE JURY WILL

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.965
PROVIDE OVER ABOVE THE CAL GRANT

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:40.168
PROCESS SO GOOD ON YOU.

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:41.736
AND WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:30:41.803 --> 01:30:43.037
THAT WE PROPERLY RESOURCE

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:45.940
COUNSELING TEAMS ON CAMPUSES.

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:48.442
TO KEEP STUDENTS FOCUSED. TO

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:50.211
IDENTIFY STUDENTS EARLY WHO ARE

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.379
FAILING COURSES IN A BEEN A

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.314
MAJOR THAT THEY SELECTED THAT

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:55.149
THEY PERHAPS ARE NOT.

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:57.351
A CLIP TO TO TO MOVE FORWARD IN

01:30:57.418 --> 01:30:58.786

AND MOVE THEM ACROSS THE FINISH

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.695
LINE TO GRADUATION I THINK

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.363
THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE WE GOT A

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:13.201

OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE I'M TALKING.

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:30.878
BUT THERE'S LIMITED.

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:33.581
CENTRALIZED DATA ON PROJECT

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:34.649
REBOUND BUT BASED ON A RECENT

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:35.683
SURVEY OF CAMPUSES BY THE

PAGE SIXTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA.

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.795
GIVEN THE STATE'S INTEREST IN

01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:49.497

MENTIONED MR CHAIR THE

LEGISLATURE MAY AGREE THAT WITH

01:32:53.634 --> 01:32:55.002
THE GOVERNOR THAT THIS.

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:57.939
GROUP OF STUDENTS IS IS HIGHLY

AS A HIGH PRIORITY YOU TO BE

SERVED AND IF SO.

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:02.944
THE AMOUNT PROPOSED BY THE

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:05.346
GOVERNOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.114
THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING IT'S

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:09.450
QUITE SMALL I REALISTICALLY IT'S

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:13.120
ENOUGH FOR ONE OR TWO STAFF.

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:15.323
YOU KNOW.

01:33:15.389 --> 01:33:17.325
TOTAL THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:19.026
SO RATHER THAN PROVIDING THIS

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.628
AMOUNT LEGISLATURE COULD

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:21.896
ENCOURAGE CSU TO LEVERAGE THE

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:24.665
MUCH LARGERPOT OF MONEY THAT

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:26.267
THE STATE PROVIDES.

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.569
IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:29.670
WHICH WHICH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT.

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:31.605
POTENTIALLY UP TO TWO HUNDRED

01:33:31.672 --> 01:33:33.174
FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.442
THE BUDGET YEAR.

01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:35.376
SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:37.812
ENCOURAGE CSU TO LEVERAGE THIS

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:40.081
MONEY THIS GRADUATION INITIATIVE

01:33:40.147 --> 01:33:43.384
MONEY -- AND USE IT FOR FORMERLY

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.186
INCARCERATED STUDENTS THROUGH

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:46.954
PROJECT REBOUND DOING SO WOULD

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.689
BE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:49.657
CAMPUS IS.

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:51.559
ALREADY DO HOWEVER HOW THEY

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:52.927
ALREADY USE GRADUATION

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:55.596
INITIATIVE MONEY FOR OTHER AT

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:57.131
RISK STUDENTS SUCH AS FORMER

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:59.300
FOSTER YOUTH ARE ENROLLED AT CSU

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:00.568
IN THAT HAVE SPECIAL PROGRAMS.

01:34:00.634 --> 01:34:03.170
AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS THAT

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:04.071
HAVE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS AND

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:05.906
RECEIVE GRADUATION MONEY OR USE

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:07.842
GRADUATION MONEY FOR THESE

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:09.076
PURPOSES.

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.245
SO WE WE DOES RECOMMEND

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:11.946
LEGISLATURE ENCOURAGE CSU TO

01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:13.481
PLACE A HIGH PRIORITY ON USING

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:15.549
GRADUATION INITIATIVE FUNDS TO

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:16.951
SUPPORT PROJECT REBOUND

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:19.653
LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO WANT TO

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.322
SEE IF YOU TO REPORT.

01:34:21.389 --> 01:34:24.725
MORE REGULARLY ON PROJECT

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.627
REBOUND.

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:28.696
ENROLLMENT IN ROMAN AND OUTCOMES

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:32.533
HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.200

JOB OUTCOMES OF THESE GRADUATES

01:34:38.372 --> 01:34:40.241
AND OF COURSE DATA ON RECIDIVISM?

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:41.575
OF ALL THAT WOULD BE REALLY

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:42.910
IMPORTANT FOR LEGISLATURE TO

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.779
KNOW AND BE ABLE TO MONITOR YEAH

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:45.980
I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL I MEAN

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:48.582
I'VE I SUSPECT THAT THIS IS A

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:50.985
VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:51.519
THAT.

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:53.521
SORT OF CROSSES A VARIETY OF

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:55.990
VERY BUDGET AREAS APPEAR IN

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:57.758
INTEREST AREAS OF MY COLLEAGUES --

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:59.326
FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:01.328
SUBCOMMITTEE TO THE POLICY

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:11.305
WHAT I HAVE FOUND IS DATA

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:13.607
SOMETIMES DRIVES [inaudible]

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:16.043
BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS.

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.812
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:20.014
OUT A WAY TO CENTRALIZE THE DATA

01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:21.348
COLLECTION IDENTIFY WHAT THE

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:23.451
DATA POINTS ARE THAT WE NEED TO

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:24.618

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:33.327
HOW MUCH I MEAN I WOULD THINK

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:36.664
THAT THE THE BEST USE OF THE TWO

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:37.198
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR

THE BUDGET MAY BE.

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:40.701
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:42.002
CENTRALIZED DATA COLLECTION

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:43.737
SYSTEM THAT HAS DATA POINTS THAT

01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:45.973

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:49.916
JOURNEY THAT IT TOOK TO GET TO

01:44:49.983 --> 01:44:52.519
THIS PLACE.

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:54.454
BECAUSE OF THE AS A YOUNG PERSON

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:55.022
I WAS DOING EVERYTHING IN MY

01:44:55.088 --> 01:44:55.656
POWER.

01:44:55.722 --> 01:44:57.724
TO AVOID COLLEGE.

01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:59.259
I HAVE TO MEET IT IS KIND OF A

01:44:59.326 --> 01:45:00.527
MIRACLE TO GET HERE.

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:01.995
AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:04.164
REBOUNDS SPECIFICALLY.

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:06.233
SO SO IN IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD A

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:07.801
YOU KNOW I'VE COME TO THAT THE

01:45:07.868 --> 01:45:09.836
REALIZATION THAT COLLEGE WAS NOT

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:10.804
FOR ME I WOULD NEVER SMART

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:13.106
ENOUGH TO BE THAT SHOULD AYE

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:14.141
JUSTIN BELONG AS WELL THE FOLKS.

01:45:14.207 --> 01:45:19.046
AND THE IN IN THINKING LIKE THAT

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:20.614
WHAT I CALL IT STINKING THINKING.

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:21.748
MAKE IT COST ME DEARLY AND

01:45:21.815 --> 01:45:22.716
BECAUSE SHORTLY AFTER HIGH

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:23.984
SCHOOL I MADE IT THROUGH HIGH

01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:26.753
SCHOOL MAINLY BECAUSE MOMS WOULD

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.822
ALLOW ANYTHING OTHER OTHER THAN

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:30.924
THAT IN THIS WORLD GIRLS WEDDING

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:33.160
AND I COULD PLAY BASKETBALL.

01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:34.995
BUT BUT THE REALITY OF IT I MADE

01:45:35.062 --> 01:45:37.164
IT THROUGH AND AND BUT SHORTLY

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:39.533
AFTER AT AGE TWENTY I FOUND

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:40.967
MYSELF FACED A LIFE SENTENCE FOR

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:42.369
MAKING SOME.

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:44.337
SOME PRETTY BAD MISTAKES.

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:46.139
NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T ACCEPT THE

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:47.140
DEAL OF LIFE FIND OF GOING TO

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:47.641
TRIAL IN COMING OUT WAS

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:48.408
SEVENTEEN YEARS BUT THE THE

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:49.676
REALIZATION IS THERE'S STILL A

01:45:49.743 --> 01:45:50.243
LOT OF YEARS THAT I GOT TO

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:51.244
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:54.881
MYSELF AND AND AND BULL FORTY OR

01:45:54.948 --> 01:45:55.882
EITHER SUCCUMB. TO THE THIS

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:57.184
PRISON LIFESTYLE IN AND MAYBE

01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:58.051
NEVER MAKE IT.

01:45:58.118 --> 01:46:00.220
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL

01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:01.722
REALITY OF OF ACCEPTING THAT IS

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:02.255
HARD I SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:06.093
REPUTABLE PEOPLE NOT NOT MAKE IT

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:06.693
TO IS SOMEONE CUT THEIR WRISTS

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:09.429
SOME OF THEM.

01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:10.964
JUST SUBMITTED TO PRISON

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:12.232
POLITICS AND END UP CATCHING A

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:13.934
WHOLE BUNCH MORE TIME.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.069
BUT BUT THE KEY THAT TEETERING

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.504
POINT FOR ME WAS AND IN THE

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:20.073
FIFTH YEAR OF OF SAN QUENTIN

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.108
CARSON SECTION IT WAS A IT WAS A

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:23.176
BROCHURE THAT HAD A OLD BROCHURE

01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:25.011
FROM PROJECT REBOUND AHEAD A

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:26.646
LITTLE STORY ABOUT JOHN -- WENT.

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:28.115
AND I READIT AND IT HAD TO

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:30.951
ADDRESS ON IN IN THE KINDA

01:46:31.017 --> 01:46:31.918
SPARKED SOMETHING IN ME SO I I

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.653
DIDN'T NUMBER ONE I DIDN'T KNOW

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.387
A LOT ABOUT COLLEGE.

01:46:34.454 --> 01:46:35.622
I FOUND OUT ABOUT SOCIOLOGY

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:37.224
THROUGH WRITING.

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.892
PROJECT REBOUND AT THE TIME THE

01:46:38.959 --> 01:46:39.659
DIRECTOR WAS A LADY NAME --

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:41.528
KINDA WALKER.

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.130
WHEN SHE TAUGHT ME WHAT I NEEDED

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:43.830
TO KNOW SHE BASICALLY?

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:45.499
IS SOME ACADEMIC ADVISING

01:46:45.565 --> 01:46:46.833
THROUGH THE MAIL TO TELL ME THE

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.201
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENERATED AND

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:49.703
AND A MAJOR.

01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:50.704
AND AT THAT POINT I KIND OF HAD

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:52.773
SOMETHING TO TO DIRECT MY MY

01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:53.874
JOURNEY TO WORK BECAUSE IT'S

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:54.641
HARD.

01:46:54.708 --> 01:46:56.243
TO REALIZE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:57.511
HOME NEXT CHRISTMAS OR THE ONE

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:58.512
AT THE END OF THE ONE AFTER THAT

01:46:58.578 --> 01:46:59.846
AND I HAD QUITE.

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:00.413
QUITE A FEW OF THOSE TO DEAL

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.181
WITH.

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:03.517
AND BUT AT THAT POINT IN FIGURE

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:06.086
IN THE WHAT MY JOURNEY WAS ABOUT

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:07.120
AND AND THAT I CAN.

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:08.388
I WOULD LIKE A NATURAL BORN

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:10.056
SOCIOLOGISTS AND DIDN'T KNOW IT.

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:13.160
AND SO I HAD SOMETHING TO AIM TO

01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:13.827
WHAT AT THAT LIGHT AT THE END OF

01:47:13.894 --> 01:47:14.361
THE TUNNEL KIND OF GOT ME

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:16.029
THROUGH THAT TIME AND I DID THAT.

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:18.698
AND WHEN I FINALLY ARRIVED ON

01:47:18.765 --> 01:47:19.666
THE CAMPUS AFTER.

01:47:19.733 --> 01:47:21.067
AFTER NINE AND A HALF YEARS

01:47:21.134 --> 01:47:22.435
LATER OF OF SERVING THAT

01:47:22.502 --> 01:47:23.770
CALIFORNIA PRISON SENTENCE.

01:47:23.837 --> 01:47:27.207
I FELT COMPLETELY EMPOWERED AND

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:28.508
BEING AROUND FOLKS THAT HAD HAD

01:47:28.575 --> 01:47:29.810

SUCCESSFUL PERSON OUTSIDE OF

THOSE PRISON WALLS BECAUSE I

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:36.349
JUST REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.017
DO WITH.

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:38.518

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:40.086

AND AND WHAT IT'S DONE FOR A

01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:00.841
WHOLE BUNCH OF FOLKS NOW BEING

01:48:00.907 --> 01:48:01.908
ABLE TO SEE IT ON ALL THESE

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:03.243
OTHER CAMPUSES GO. TO LAND ON

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:04.544
ANY OF THE NINE CAMPUSES THAT

I FEEL IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT I

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.355

HI THE LEGISLATURE WILL JUST

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:42.008
WANT TO KNOW BASIC INFORMATION --

01:59:42.074 --> 01:59:45.211
WHAT SPECIFIC PROBLEMS ARE THERE

01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:48.347
AT THE IT IT BUILDINGS ON CAMPUS

01:59:48.414 --> 01:59:50.483

FACILITY UPGRADES WOULD NEED TO

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:56.088
BE DONE -- WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:58.291
COST OF THAT OF JUST BASIC

01:59:58.357 --> 01:59:59.959
INFORMATION LEGISLATURE ALWAYS

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:02.061

HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS WELL.

02:00:09.201 --> 02:00:10.503
FIRST LET ME ADDRESS THE THEATER

02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:12.438
I MEAN I'M NOT AN ARTS PERSON I

02:00:12.505 --> 02:00:14.273
DON'T HAVE AN ARTS DEGREE MY

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:17.610
UNDERSTANDING IS THE THE SMALL

02:00:17.677 --> 02:00:19.078
LIKE IS THE REFERRED TO AS BLACK

BOX THEATERS OR SEEM TO BE.

02:00:21.547 --> 02:00:23.849
A THING NOW -- COMMUNITIES ARE

02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:25.585
CONSTRUCTING THE ADDITION TO

02:00:25.651 --> 02:00:28.220
LARGER SCALE AUDITORIUM TYPE

02:00:28.287 --> 02:00:29.755
FACILITIES SO.

02:00:29.822 --> 02:00:31.257
I ASSUME THERE MUST BE SOME

02:00:31.324 --> 02:00:32.725
EDUCATIONAL REASON.

02:00:32.792 --> 02:00:34.594
WHY YOU WOULD -- WANT THE

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:37.063
FACILITY LIKE THAT IN SORT OF

02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:38.864
HARD FOR US TO JUMP IN THE

02:00:38.931 --> 02:00:40.866
MIDDLE OF ACADEMIA AND TRY TO

02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:42.535
DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR A FROM AN

02:00:42.602 --> 02:00:44.236
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.505
ASSUME THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL.

02:00:46.572 --> 02:00:47.773
THE FACILITY IS GOING TO BE USED

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.475
FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES NOT

02:00:49.542 --> 02:00:51.310
COMMUNITY ENTERTAINMENT.

02:00:51.377 --> 02:00:53.479
NECESSARILY THIS IS THAT THAT

02:00:53.546 --> 02:00:54.714
THAT.

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:55.982
THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT.

02:00:56.048 --> 02:00:57.850
AND THEN IS TO THE LARGER ISSUE

02:00:57.917 --> 02:00:59.685
HAS TO DO WITH THE DEFERRED

WEEK WE'VE BEEN WORKING THE LAST

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:36.656
NUMBER OF YEARS.

ACCURACY OF OUR DEFERRED

02:01:39.892 --> 02:01:41.360

BEEN INVESTING.

02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:46.565
OF RECENTLY AND SO THAT'S WHERE

02:01:46.632 --> 02:01:48.434
WE'VE HAD THIS UPDATE OF THE

02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:50.002
THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION.

02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:51.871
AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THIS

02:01:51.937 --> 02:01:54.240
ISSUE AS MUCH AS WE TOOK

02:01:54.306 --> 02:01:56.242
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THE

NEW TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE

02:01:58.044 --> 02:01:59.078
PRODUCED.

02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:00.579
A STAFFING END.

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:02.548
OF INVESTMENT OF PHYSICAL PLANT

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:04.884
WE WE ALSO THEN REALIZE WE'RE

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:06.152
DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB BECAUSE

02:02:06.218 --> 02:02:08.854
OF SYSTEMS THAT HAVE NOT LASTED

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:09.422
FORTY FIFTY YEARS ARE STILL

02:02:09.488 --> 02:02:10.056
GOING.

02:02:10.122 --> 02:02:11.357
SOAK BUT THOSE ARE THE SYSTEMS

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:13.025
THAT WE NEED TO REPLACE.

02:02:13.092 --> 02:02:14.560
A LOT OF OUR BUILDING STOP WAS

02:02:14.627 --> 02:02:16.829
BUILT IN THE SIXTIES WITH THE

02:02:16.896 --> 02:02:18.597
THE GROWTH OF THE CSU BUT WE DO

02:02:18.664 --> 02:02:20.700
HAVE I WANNA SAY 15% OF OUR

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:22.101
INVENTORY THAT ARE SIX YEARS OLD

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:23.069
OR MORE.

02:02:23.135 --> 02:02:25.738
SO SO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:27.773
ANNUAL AMOUNTS THAT WE NEED TO

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.508
REINVEST TO REPLACE BUILDINGS

02:02:29.575 --> 02:02:30.976
THAT HAVE COME TO THEIR END OF

02:02:31.043 --> 02:02:32.845
AGE IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND

02:02:32.912 --> 02:02:35.448
FIFTY MILLION.

02:02:35.514 --> 02:02:36.382
THREE FIFTY THREE SEVENTY OF IT

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:37.850
AND THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS.

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:39.452
THAT'S JUST OF THINGS THAT ARE

02:02:39.518 --> 02:02:41.253
COMING OF AGE THAT YEAR.

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.555
IT DOESN'T ADDRESS.

02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:44.557
TRYING TO CHIP AWAY AT THE THE

02:02:44.623 --> 02:02:46.292
BACKLOG THE THREE POINT.

02:02:46.358 --> 02:02:47.693
SEVEN IF WE INCLUDE THAT THAT

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:49.095
NUMBER GOES UPWARDS OF SIX

02:02:49.161 --> 02:02:50.229
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PER

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:52.431
YEAR AND YOU RECEIVE CAREER WHAT

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:53.199
WOULD BE RECEIVING ON THIS

02:02:53.265 --> 02:02:55.868
BUDGET WELL IN THIS BUDGET TWO

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:56.469
HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION SO

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:58.204
WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS.

02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:59.138
WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS HOWEVER.

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:00.873
BREAKING THOUGH THIS IS RECORD

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.341
BREAKING IN TERMS OF ONE TIME

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:04.210
DEFERRED MADE BUT NO I'M LISTEN

02:03:04.276 --> 02:03:04.977
I'M I'VE.

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:05.678
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THE

02:03:05.745 --> 02:03:07.646
GOVERNOR'S DONE IN THIS BUDGETS

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:09.014
OF NOTHING I SAY SHOULD BE

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:11.283
DEEMED CRITICISM I'M JUST TRYING

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:12.585
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET A

02:03:12.651 --> 02:03:15.121
HANDLE ON THIS NOW EVERYTHING IS

02:03:15.187 --> 02:03:16.789
BUDGET CONSTRAINED AND I I'M

02:03:16.856 --> 02:03:18.057
GLAD I'M NOT THE GOVERNOR AND

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:19.158
I'M GLAD I'M NOT THE DEPARTMENT

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:20.126
OF FINANCE.

02:03:20.192 --> 02:03:21.694
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW.

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:24.430
OF HE OR THEY BALLOTS THE

02:03:24.497 --> 02:03:27.233
VARIOUS -- STAKEHOLDER --

02:03:27.299 --> 02:03:29.769
REQUESTS AND FEND OFF THE HANDS

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:31.737
THAT ARE TRYING.

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:34.640
TO GET IN THE BUCKET BUT I AM

02:03:34.707 --> 02:03:36.776
CURIOUS SO.

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:37.877
YOU NEED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:39.645
FIFTY MILLION.

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:42.114
RIGHT IT AND SO ONE OF THE ONE

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:44.984
OF THE BUDGET REQUEST THIS IS

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:46.652
INCLUDED I MENTIONED EARLIER.

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:48.420
IS EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS AND

02:03:48.487 --> 02:03:50.389
BASS FUNDING FOR A FACILITIES

02:03:50.456 --> 02:03:51.657
AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:54.160
SO THAT WOULD BE ONE IF WE HAD

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:56.462
INCREASE SUPPORT BUDGET FUNDING.

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:58.130
THEN WE COULD USE THOSE DOLLARS

02:03:58.197 --> 02:03:59.965
TO FINANCE SOME OF THE DEFERRED

02:04:00.032 --> 02:04:01.133
MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IN IN THAT

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.301
IS.

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:04.503
LARGELY WHAT IS -- SOME OF THE

02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:06.105
PROJECTS THAT ARE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:07.640
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IT WAS WHEN

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:09.809
THE ITEMS THAT -- TO MISLI

02:04:09.875 --> 02:04:10.409
INCLUDED IN THE AT WITH THE

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:11.377
AGENDA.

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:13.979
YEAH THOSE ARE ITEMS AT THE END

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:15.114
OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE.

02:04:15.181 --> 02:04:16.482
REFER BOND FINANCING.

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:19.218
OF SYSTEMS THAT HAVE A LIFE OF

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:21.687
THE LIFE CYCLE OF THIRTY YEARS

02:04:21.754 --> 02:04:23.289
FORTY YEARS FIFTY YEARS BASED ON

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:25.291
HOW LONG WE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE

02:04:25.357 --> 02:04:26.358
U. SO FAR.

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:28.527
SO OUR REQUESTS REALLY OUR

02:04:28.594 --> 02:04:29.829
APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE

02:04:29.895 --> 02:04:31.330
BACKLOG IS ASKING FOR PERMANENT

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:33.933
BASE SPENDING SO WE CAN FINANCE --

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:35.801
SO FOR THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:37.236
NEEDS THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE GONNA

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:38.404
GET TO IT IN.

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:41.974
AND TO INCREASE OUR BASE FUNDING.

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:43.409
WE GET PROJECT WHO HAS FROM TIME

02:04:43.475 --> 02:04:44.944
TO TIME IS THERE A IS THERE A

02:04:45.010 --> 02:04:47.813
WRITTEN LONG TERM DEFERRED

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.381
MAINTENANCE PLAN THAT.

02:04:49.448 --> 02:04:50.249
IT'S SORT OF BEEN THOUGHT

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:52.218
THROUGH AND REDUCE TO WRITING --

02:04:52.284 --> 02:04:54.053
WHETHER IT INCLUDES BOND

02:04:54.119 --> 02:04:57.723
FINANCING OR ONE TIME MONEY OR

02:04:57.790 --> 02:05:00.226
FUTURE ANTICIPATED BUDGET

02:05:00.292 --> 02:05:02.161
REQUESTS -- THE GENERAL FUND.

02:05:02.228 --> 02:05:03.696
WE HAVE WORKED ON A PLAN OVER

02:05:03.762 --> 02:05:05.397
TIME IT DOES SOMETHING THAT

02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:06.866
FALLS TO THE BACK BURNER SPARSE

02:05:06.932 --> 02:05:08.334
COMPLAINING THAT REPORT.

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:09.401
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE

02:05:09.468 --> 02:05:11.170
INCLUDED IN OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN

02:05:11.237 --> 02:05:13.172
IS A BY CAMPUS LIST OF WHAT THE

02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:14.974
BACKLOG IS PER CAMPUS FOR THE

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:16.275
BUILDINGS.

02:05:16.342 --> 02:05:17.509
AND FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:19.011
THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING WE'VE

02:05:19.078 --> 02:05:21.046
WORKED ON RECENTLY FOR THE PIPES

02:05:21.113 --> 02:05:22.648
BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS AND AND

02:05:22.715 --> 02:05:24.116
WHAT THAT COST IS THE WITH THEIR

02:05:24.183 --> 02:05:26.285
LIFE CYCLES WERE STILL.

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:27.553
WORKING ON THAT ASPECT.

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:29.622
AND WE IDENTIFY HOW MUCH EACH

02:05:29.688 --> 02:05:31.056
CAMPUS SHOULD BE FUNDING AND

02:05:31.123 --> 02:05:32.858
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE'RE NOT

02:05:32.925 --> 02:05:34.426
OUT THAT AMOUNT THAT WOULD EQUAL

02:05:34.493 --> 02:05:35.761
THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUT

02:05:35.828 --> 02:05:37.429
TRYING TO INCREASE THE

02:05:37.496 --> 02:05:39.098
VISIBILITY OF THE NUMBER.

02:05:39.164 --> 02:05:40.666
AND WE'RE NOW TRACKING.

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:42.001
WE'VE OF CHANGE SOME OF OUR

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:43.168
ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SO WE CAN

02:05:43.235 --> 02:05:44.536
TRACK HOW MUCH ARE YOU SPENDING

02:05:44.603 --> 02:05:45.938
CAMPUS ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:47.506
THAT WE CAN BETTER YOU KNOW MAKE

02:05:47.573 --> 02:05:49.742
A JUSTIFICATION ON HOW MUCH WE

02:05:49.808 --> 02:05:51.477
NEED AND ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE

02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:52.878
REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:55.214
FINANCE THE LEGISLATURE ILIO.

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.782
DID WE SPEND IT DID WE NOT YOU

02:05:56.849 --> 02:05:58.484
WHERE WE FALLING SHORT.

02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:59.818
AND I GUESS THAT'S WHY WE

02:05:59.885 --> 02:06:02.187
CONSTANTLY HARP ON REPORTING

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:04.123
REQUIREMENTS A MINUTE IT'S A IF

02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.290
IT.

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:05.891
IF THE IF.

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:07.493
IF THERE'S A PLAN.

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:09.094
AND IF THE REPORTS ARE CLEARER

02:06:09.161 --> 02:06:11.430
AND PRESENTED TO US THAN IT IT

02:06:11.497 --> 02:06:13.065
ALLOWS US TO HELP.

02:06:13.132 --> 02:06:15.834
YOU HELP YOURSELVES IN TERMS OF

02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:18.370
FUNDING BECAUSE WE TALK A LOT

02:06:18.437 --> 02:06:19.571
ABOUT.

02:06:19.638 --> 02:06:20.940
IN CASE YOU TWELVE PER PUPIL

02:06:21.006 --> 02:06:22.875
SPENDING IN HIGHER EDUCATION YOU

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:23.776
KNOW.

02:06:23.842 --> 02:06:25.945
DIRECTING FUNDS GRADUATION IS

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:27.713
INITIATIVES INCREASED ENROLLMENT

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.682
BUT IF WE DON'T MAINTAIN THE

02:06:29.748 --> 02:06:31.383
FACILITIES WE HAVE IF WE DON'T

02:06:31.450 --> 02:06:32.851
HAVE FACILITIES IN WHICH TO DO

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.620
THE TEACHING.

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:35.187
UNLESS WE'RE GOING TO PITCH

02:06:35.254 --> 02:06:36.522
TENTS.

02:06:36.588 --> 02:06:38.223
WE DON'T ACCOMPLISH OUR CORE

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:39.591
MISSIONS SO.

02:06:39.658 --> 02:06:41.093
IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:42.094
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THE

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:43.996
MONEY THAT YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN

02:06:44.063 --> 02:06:45.497
THE BUILDINGS THAT YOU HAVE.

02:06:45.564 --> 02:06:47.499
LET ALONE BUILD THE NEW ONES

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:48.801
THAT YOU NEED TO BUILD IN ORDER.

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:49.802
TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASED

02:06:49.868 --> 02:06:51.537
ENROLLMENT THAT WERE PRESSURING

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:53.639
YOU [inaudible] TO TO ACCOMPLISH

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:53.939
[inaudible]

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:55.808
SO.

02:06:55.874 --> 02:06:56.742
THANK YOU AND JUST FROM A

02:06:56.809 --> 02:06:58.277
FUNDING PERSPECTIVE ON THE PLAN

02:06:58.344 --> 02:06:59.912
THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGE

02:06:59.979 --> 02:07:00.946
RIGHT MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR THIS

02:07:01.013 --> 02:07:02.948
WOULD WE WE ARE FUNDED BY TWO

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:04.350
PRIMARY SOURCES.

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:06.785
STATE GENERAL FUND IN TUITION

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:08.020
FEE REVENUE RIGHT.

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:09.888
SO WHEN -- AND I KNOW THAT

02:07:09.955 --> 02:07:12.524
NOBODY AT THIS TABLE AND NOBODY

02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:13.592
ON THE DíAS ONCE TUITION TO GO

02:07:13.659 --> 02:07:14.860
UP EVER.

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:16.595
BUT THAT'S ONE ELEMENT OF OUR

02:07:16.662 --> 02:07:19.098
FUNDING STRATEGY IS WE HAVE

02:07:19.164 --> 02:07:20.399
TUITION THAT SUPPORT US.

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:21.767
SO IF THAT'S OFF THE TABLE AND

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:23.135
IT IS OFF THE TABLE WITH THE

02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:24.370
ADMINISTRATION ALREADY.

02:07:24.436 --> 02:07:25.471
AND WE HAVE ALREADY PULLED THAT

02:07:25.537 --> 02:07:27.639
OPTION FOR NINETEEN TWENTY OFF

02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:28.240
THE TABLE AS WELL.

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:29.775
THAT A FALLS ON THE GENERAL FUND

02:07:29.842 --> 02:07:30.876
WHETHER THE GENERAL FUND COULD

02:07:30.943 --> 02:07:31.744
SUPPORT THAT SO THAT'S THE

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:32.878
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:34.079
PREDICAMENT THAT WERE IN AS A

02:07:34.146 --> 02:07:35.447
STATE UNIVERSITIES WERE FUNDED

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:37.583
BY. TWO REVENUE SOURCES ONE

02:07:37.649 --> 02:07:39.051
THAT'S VERY LIMITED AND HAS TO

02:07:39.118 --> 02:07:40.452
PAY FOR A LOT OF OTHER THINGS IN

02:07:40.519 --> 02:07:41.687
THE STATE THE OTHER ONE THAT.

02:07:41.754 --> 02:07:42.955
MOST FOLKS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:44.456
SEEING CREE SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:07:44.523 --> 02:07:46.859
CHALLENGE IN TRYING TO DEVELOP A

02:07:46.925 --> 02:07:48.027
PLAN AND ACTUALLY FUND.

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:49.261
NO I UNDERSTAND.

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:50.896
AND YOUR CHALLENGES DEPARTMENT

02:07:50.963 --> 02:07:52.831
OF FINANCE SHOWN SO EVERYBODY'S

02:07:52.898 --> 02:07:54.566
IN THE SAME BOAT TRYING TO

02:07:54.633 --> 02:07:57.603
FIGURE THIS THING OUT WILL WILL

02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:58.470
CONTINUE TO WORK IT.

02:07:58.537 --> 02:07:59.805
ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS PARTICULAR

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:00.973
ITEM YES MA'AM.

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:02.474
IF I MAY I AM.

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:03.876
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- WITH

02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:07.546
THE LEGISLATION CHANGED IN TWO

02:08:07.613 --> 02:08:08.180
THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHERE THE CSU

02:08:08.247 --> 02:08:09.214
COULD USE ITS OWN FUNDS TO

02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:11.350
FINANCE CAPITAL WE DID THEN

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:12.418
START INCLUDING DEFERRED

02:08:12.484 --> 02:08:14.053
MAINTENANCE PLANNING IN OUR FIVE

02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:15.020
YEAR PLAN.

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:16.422
SO NOT ONLY FORWARD LOOK AT

02:08:16.488 --> 02:08:18.690
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS BUT ALSO I

02:08:18.757 --> 02:08:20.359
CAMPUS HOW MUCH THEY'RE LOOKING

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:21.293
TO SPEND OF THEIR OWN MONEY HOW

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.628
MUCH WE WOULD PUT IT.

02:08:22.694 --> 02:08:24.763
OF FINANCE DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:26.365
MAINTENANCE.

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:27.633
AND AS FAR AS THE LEGISLATIVE

02:08:27.699 --> 02:08:29.668
ANALYST'S OF COMMENT ON

02:08:29.735 --> 02:08:31.203
REPORTING WE ALSO INCLUDE.

02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:32.838
WHAT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:34.640
BY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS

02:08:34.706 --> 02:08:36.308
HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE CSU

02:08:36.375 --> 02:08:37.142
FROM THE STATE?

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:39.111
THE WEAVER SEE ABOUT NINETY FIVE

02:08:39.178 --> 02:08:39.945
MILLION OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF

02:08:40.012 --> 02:08:41.513
YEARS SO THOSE PROJECTS ARE

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:43.315
IDENTIFIED BY CAMPUS.

02:08:43.382 --> 02:08:44.383
SO THAT SINCE WE DO TRY TO BE

02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:45.818
TRANSPARENT ON HOW WE USE THAT

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:47.619
AUTHORITY AND WHERE WE'VE BEEN

02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:48.654
SPENDING THE DEFERRED

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.122
MAINTENANCE FUNDS BY CAMPUS.

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:52.024
I DO WANT TO TOUCH BASE ON THE

02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:53.525
SAN DIEGO PROJECT.

02:08:53.592 --> 02:08:55.227
WE WE HAVE SHARED WITH THE

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:56.061
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S AND

02:08:56.128 --> 02:08:57.029
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WE

02:08:57.096 --> 02:08:58.430
COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IN

02:08:58.497 --> 02:09:02.067
DEFINING THE BENEFITS OF THE

02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:03.001
PROJECT.

02:09:03.068 --> 02:09:03.669
SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS NEW.

02:09:03.735 --> 02:09:05.437
NEW PROJECT WILL NOT ONLY

02:09:05.504 --> 02:09:07.806
ADDRESS EIGHTY EIGHT PROBLEMS IN

02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:09.108
THE TOWN HALL THEATRE.

02:09:09.174 --> 02:09:11.610
BUT IT WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS

02:09:11.677 --> 02:09:12.411
EIGHTY A PROBLEMS IN THE

02:09:12.478 --> 02:09:14.780
EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENTAL THEATER

02:09:14.847 --> 02:09:16.682
AND THE DANCE STUDIO SO THOSE

02:09:16.748 --> 02:09:18.183
ARE.

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:18.750
TWO IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO SAN

02:09:18.817 --> 02:09:20.119
DIEGO STATE ARE FAMILIAR WITH

02:09:20.185 --> 02:09:21.887
THAT IT'S VERY -- HILLY SO WE

02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:23.889
HAVE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE

02:09:23.956 --> 02:09:25.524
ENTRANCES AT MULTIPLE LEVELS.

02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:27.226
CURRENTLY THE DON PAL FEEDER AND

02:09:27.292 --> 02:09:28.627
SOME THE OTHER THEATERS YOU HAVE

02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:30.062
TO GO IF YOU'RE A DISABLED

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:30.829
PATRONS.

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:32.164
YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:35.033
BUILDING TO ACCESS THE RESTROOM

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:36.335
WHICH IS NOT UNIVERSAL ACCESS.

02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:38.904
SO THIS PROPOSED PROJECT.

02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:42.908
IN AN ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES.

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:43.876
WE THINK IF WE INCLUDED THE COST

02:09:43.942 --> 02:09:46.945
TO BRING THOSE OTHER -- RECITAL

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:49.481
HOLES AND DANCE STUDIOS UP TO

02:09:49.548 --> 02:09:50.649
EIGHTY EIGHT COMPLIANCE FIRE

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:52.885
SAFETY CODES IT WOULD PROBABLY

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:55.154
REDUCE THE DELTA SEVENTY MILLION

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:56.488
REDUCE THAT DOWN.

02:09:56.555 --> 02:09:59.258
TO MAYBE SIX TO THE NINE MILLION

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:01.627
BECAUSE OF THE COST TO IN PROVE

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:03.295
THE OTHER SPACES.

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:05.464
AND SO IT SO I THINK THERE ARE

02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:08.133
CERTAINLY EIGHTY ACCESS BENEFITS.

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.168
THERE IS A MAN OF DEFERRED

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:10.202
MAINTENANCE WILL BE TAKEN CARE

02:10:10.269 --> 02:10:12.905
OF BY VIRTUE OF THIS PROJECT.

02:10:12.971 --> 02:10:14.740
AND THE STUDENTS HAVE CAN'T GET

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:16.975
INTO THE DISABLED STUDENTS CAN'T

02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:20.145
GET INTO THE LIGHTING STUDIO SO

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:21.113
IT'LL ADDRESS.

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:22.881
THE ACADEMIC PORTIONS OF THE

02:10:22.948 --> 02:10:24.016
PROJECT THAT.

02:10:24.082 --> 02:10:25.517
CAN'T BE ACCOMMODATED CURRENTLY

02:10:25.584 --> 02:10:27.186
SO WE WE SEE HER SUPPORT ON THAT

02:10:27.252 --> 02:10:28.720
PROJECT.

02:10:28.787 --> 02:10:31.290
AND ON THE CHILD CARE CENTERS WE

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:32.291
HAVE BEEN COLLECTING INFORMATION

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:34.526
FROM CAMPUSES THIS IS WHERE THE

02:10:34.593 --> 02:10:37.062
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS WE LOOK AT

02:10:37.129 --> 02:10:38.330
HOW WE CAN INCREASE.

02:10:38.397 --> 02:10:41.233
OF THE NUMBER THE CAPACITY OF

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:42.968
STUDENTS CHILDREN.

02:10:43.035 --> 02:10:44.937
CURRENTLY WE HAVE PROPOSALS THAT

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:46.939
RANGE FROM A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:10:47.005 --> 02:10:47.973
DOLLARS TO THIRTY MILLION.

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.374
SO WE'RE TRYING TO BETTER

02:10:49.441 --> 02:10:51.977
UNDERSTAND WHO THE PATRONS ARE

02:10:52.044 --> 02:10:53.946
IS THAT THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE

02:10:54.012 --> 02:10:55.414
THEIR CHILDREN'S IN THE FACILITY.

02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:57.049

02:10:57.115 --> 02:10:58.383
FACULTY STAFF.

02:10:58.450 --> 02:11:01.587
AND CAN OPERATIONALLY EVEN IF BY

02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:03.655
FROM CAPITAL WE INCREASED IT CAN

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:05.090
OPERATIONALLY THEY THEY

02:11:05.157 --> 02:11:06.658
ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASE BUT WE

02:11:06.725 --> 02:11:08.026
ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT THOSE

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:09.494
FACILITIES THAT ARE STATE OWNED

02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:10.429
FACILITIES.

02:11:10.495 --> 02:11:12.931
THAT -- COULD BENEFIT FROM FROM

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:15.167
SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS -- SO

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:16.501

FINDINGS FROM CS USE LATEST

02:13:28.433 --> 02:13:30.102
LEGISLATIVE REPORT ON THE ISSUE.

02:13:30.168 --> 02:13:32.237
SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

02:13:32.304 --> 02:13:33.805
FIFTEEN MILLION OLLARS ONE TIME

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:36.208
FOR BASIC NEEDS FOR PHIL CS USE

02:13:36.274 --> 02:13:37.309
BUDGET REQUEST.

02:13:37.376 --> 02:13:38.643
CSU INDICATES THAT WOULD USE THE

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:40.545
MONEY TO EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS

02:13:40.612 --> 02:13:42.414
WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND NON

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:47.018
IN A WORKING WITH FOOD AND

02:13:47.085 --> 02:13:49.688
SECURE AND HOMELESS POPULATIONS

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:51.356
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:13:51.423 --> 02:13:52.724
IDEA WOULD BE FOR THESE

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:55.026
ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE CASE

02:13:55.093 --> 02:13:57.629

WITH COMMUNITY RESOURCES.

02:14:01.032 --> 02:14:02.134
WE HAVE A FEW ISSUES FOR THE

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:03.735
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER HERE

02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:05.170
FIRST THE ISSUE OF

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:06.405
SUSTAINABILITY.

02:14:06.471 --> 02:14:08.540
ASSUMING CAMPUSES ARE ABLE TO

02:14:08.607 --> 02:14:10.542
USE THIS MONEY THIS FIFTEEN

02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:15.680
MILLION DOLLARS. TO REACH OUT.

02:14:15.747 --> 02:14:18.150
TO NEIGHBORING -- AGENCIES TO

02:14:18.216 --> 02:14:19.451
FORM PARTNERSHIPS THERE'S A

02:14:19.518 --> 02:14:20.919
QUESTION ABOUT OKAY WILL ONCE

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:24.256
THAT RELATIONSHIP IS STABLISHED.

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:26.992
HOW WILL BE MAINTAINED?

02:14:27.058 --> 02:14:28.627
IT'S THE MONEY RUNS AWAY SO

02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:30.395
HOUSE A KIND OF SUSTAIN IN THAT

02:14:30.462 --> 02:14:32.464
WAY SECOND THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:34.800
WISH FOR CSU TO ESTABLISH CLEAR.

02:14:34.866 --> 02:14:37.736
GOALS TARGETS AND METRICS ALSO

02:14:37.803 --> 02:14:39.438
THE LEGISLATURE CAN ASSESS THE

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:42.107
IMPACT OF ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY

02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:44.543
THAT UP FOR CSU BASIC NEEDS I

02:14:44.609 --> 02:14:46.244
MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE

02:14:46.311 --> 02:14:47.779
SURVEY THAT FOUND.

02:14:47.846 --> 02:14:50.782
THIS SURVEY FROM TWO THOUSAND

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:51.316
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT CSU

02:14:51.383 --> 02:14:51.950
CONDUCTED.

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:54.519
HOW A LOT OF THE SERVICES IN

02:14:54.586 --> 02:14:55.520
FRONT OF YOU ARE?

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:57.589
UNDER UTILIZING LEGISLATURE WILL

02:14:57.656 --> 02:14:58.757
WANT TO KNOW OKAY IF THE

02:14:58.824 --> 02:15:00.459
LEGISLATURE PUTS IN FIFTEEN

02:15:00.525 --> 02:15:02.561
MILLION DOLLARS OR HOWEVER.

02:15:02.627 --> 02:15:03.762
MUCH.

02:15:03.829 --> 02:15:05.797
WHAT IS THE IMPACT OUR OUR

02:15:05.864 --> 02:15:07.532
STUDENTS STARTING TO LEARN MORE

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:09.434
ABOUT THE SERVICES AND AVAILING

THEMSELVES OF THE SERVICES?

02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:13.772
THIRD THERE'S REALLY THE OF A

02:15:13.839 --> 02:15:15.273
MUCH MORE STEPPING BACK A MUCH

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:17.008
MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE ABOUT HOW

02:15:17.075 --> 02:15:18.176
STUDENTS.

02:15:18.243 --> 02:15:20.812
PAY FOR COLLEGE OF FINANCIALLY

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:22.781
FINANCIAL AID IS THE PRIMARY WAY

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:25.984
STUDENTS PAY FOR BASIC COSTS

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:27.686
WHICH IS ROOM AND BOARD.

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:28.720

IS ABLE TO OUR COMMUNITY

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:41.500
COLLEGES.

TO AND STUDENTS AT CSU AND

02:15:43.134 --> 02:15:45.203
COMMUNITY COLLEGES MAY HAVE TO

02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:47.105
WORK LONGER HOURS OR TAKE OUT

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:48.907
MORE LOANS IN ORDER TO COVER.

02:15:48.974 --> 02:15:51.243
THEIR COSTS SO DESPITE YOU SEE

02:22:17.896 --> 02:22:19.898
CAMPUS IS -- ACCEPTING THE

02:22:19.964 --> 02:22:21.900
BEAUTIES WE WOULD LOVE THAT --

02:22:21.966 --> 02:22:23.167
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

02:22:23.234 --> 02:22:24.636
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

02:22:24.702 --> 02:22:25.837
SERVICES AND ALSO HAD

02:22:25.904 --> 02:22:27.572
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE USDA

02:22:27.639 --> 02:22:31.409
ABOUT THE APPLICATION FOR EBT --

02:22:31.476 --> 02:22:33.444
AND NATIONALLY IN TRADITIONALLY

02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:35.079
IT HAS NOT BEEN THE APPLICATION

02:22:35.146 --> 02:22:36.648
IS NOT CREATED FOR COLLEGE

02:22:36.714 --> 02:22:39.550
CAMPUS FOOD SERVICE PROVIDERS --

02:22:39.617 --> 02:22:41.052
SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT SIX

02:22:41.119 --> 02:22:43.187
CAMPUSES IN THE CSU THAT DO HAVE

02:22:43.254 --> 02:22:45.223

APPLICATION PROCESS WITH TVS.

02:22:47.592 --> 02:22:50.128
ARMY AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:22:50.194 --> 02:22:51.095
DO NOW IS SEE IF THERE'S A WAY

02:22:51.162 --> 02:22:53.131
TO STREAMLINE THAT APPLICATION

02:22:53.197 --> 02:22:54.799
IN OR CREATE A TEMPLATE SO THAT

02:22:54.866 --> 02:22:56.668
ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES CAN APPLY

02:22:56.734 --> 02:22:59.003
FOR EDT ARE THOSE THAT ARE READY

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:00.505

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:02.874
FACTORS THE APPLICATION PROCESS.

02:23:02.941 --> 02:23:03.308
YES.

02:23:03.374 --> 02:23:04.575
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO

02:23:04.642 --> 02:23:05.777
FACILITATE THAT.

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:08.146
WE ARE -- IN LIKE I SAID IN

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:09.847
CONVERSATIONS WITH CDSS ABOUT

02:23:09.914 --> 02:23:11.749
THIS -- WE'VE TALKED TO THEM A

02:23:11.816 --> 02:23:14.018
LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- ONE OF THE

02:23:14.085 --> 02:23:16.220
CHECKS CHECK BOXES ON THERE --

02:23:16.287 --> 02:23:18.456
ASKS WHAT TYPE OF ORGANIZATION

02:23:18.523 --> 02:23:21.259
IS APPLYING -- AND MANY OF OUR

02:23:21.326 --> 02:23:22.360
FOOD SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:24.195
PHYLLARIES SO IT DOESN'T REALLY

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:27.098
FALL INTO THAT -- WHAT THE BOXES

02:23:27.165 --> 02:23:29.701
ARE CURRENTLY THERE I'M ALSO ASK

02:23:29.767 --> 02:23:31.202
FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT

02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:33.805
WHO OWNS THE STORE OR THE THE

02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:35.606
MARKET SO PEOPLE HAVE TO GIVE UP

02:23:35.673 --> 02:23:37.442
THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION THEY

02:23:40.712 --> 02:23:41.546
HAVE BEEN?

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:43.214
A BAY AREA THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:23:43.281 --> 02:23:45.683
TALKING TO SEE THE FF AND USDA

02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:46.851
PARTNERS ABOUT.

02:23:46.918 --> 02:23:50.488
IF THERE'S A WAY TO WORK AROUND

02:23:50.555 --> 02:23:51.189
THAT.

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:52.523
WELL I WOULD I WOULD APPRECIATE

02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:53.024
IT IF YOU'D KEEP OF THE

02:23:53.091 --> 02:23:54.325
COMMITTEE STAFF POSTED ON THAT --

02:23:54.392 --> 02:23:56.094
ONYOUR EFFORTS I THINK WE NEED

02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.762
TO MOVE THAT ALONG OKAY AS

02:23:57.829 --> 02:23:59.697
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS SOON IT'S

02:23:59.764 --> 02:24:02.433
A PRETTY IMPORTANT -- ISSUED

02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:04.502
THESE TO BE RESOLVED FOR FOR THE

02:24:04.569 --> 02:24:05.970
SAKE OF THE STUDENTS SO.

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:07.438
I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY

02:24:07.505 --> 02:24:08.973
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT I WANT

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:10.241
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK JUST

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:12.577
AS DILIGENTLY ALONG SIDE YOU.

02:24:12.643 --> 02:24:14.045
TO SEE IF WE CAN BRING THIS

02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:14.645
THING TO CONCLUSION APPRECIATE

02:24:14.712 --> 02:24:15.847
IT.

02:24:15.913 --> 02:24:17.248
I'M IN THE AREA OF HOUSING I

02:24:17.315 --> 02:24:19.183
NOTICED THAT THERE IS OF OF SOME

02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:20.885
VARIATION IN THE WAKE.

02:24:20.952 --> 02:24:24.322
CAMPUSES HANDLE -- MERGING SEE

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:26.391
HOUSING VOUCHERS AND THE LIKE --

02:24:26.457 --> 02:24:28.126
IF THAT'S THE CASE SHOULDN'T WE

02:24:28.192 --> 02:24:29.961
HAVE A MORRIS SYSTEM WIDE

02:24:30.028 --> 02:24:32.797
APPROACH TO THE THE HOUSING OR

02:24:32.864 --> 02:24:34.599
DID THE ISSUES VERY CAMPUS BY

02:24:34.665 --> 02:24:37.735
CAMPUS -- MITIGATE AGAINST A

02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:40.671
SYSTEM WIDE APPROACH.

02:24:40.738 --> 02:24:43.107
I'D GO WOULD BE -- OUR CAMPUSES

02:24:43.174 --> 02:24:46.644
DO VARY BASED ON CAPACITY AT A

02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:49.514
IN THE DORMS IF THERE'S CAPACITY

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:51.282
FOR ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY HOUSING

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:52.717
THEN CAMPUSES ARE LIKELY TO DO

02:24:52.784 --> 02:24:55.620
THAT BUT IF -- THE FACILITIES

02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:58.222
ARE ALL FILLED UP -- TO STUDENTS

02:24:58.289 --> 02:24:59.891
THAT ARE PAYING FOR HOUSING THAN

02:24:59.957 --> 02:25:01.592
MOST LIKELY THAT CAMPUSES HAVE

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:02.960
TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:06.497
LOCAL HOTELS AND MOTELS TO HAVE

02:25:06.564 --> 02:25:08.266
HOTEL VOUCHERS WERE STUDENTS CAN

02:25:08.332 --> 02:25:10.935
SAY FOR A SHORT LIMóN ARE

02:25:11.002 --> 02:25:11.836
LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME

02:25:11.903 --> 02:25:12.136
[inaudible]

02:25:12.203 --> 02:25:15.039
WELL THE YOU KNOW I CAME OUT OF

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:17.041
THE MILITARY SO I TALK ABOUT

02:25:17.108 --> 02:25:18.509
METRICS ALL THE TIME BUT JUST

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:19.944
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIRTY TWO

02:25:20.011 --> 02:25:21.145
YEARS OF SOMEBODY BEATING IN MY

02:25:21.212 --> 02:25:22.447
HEAD WE HAVE.

02:25:22.513 --> 02:25:24.048
DO WE HAVE METRICS ON THE ON

02:25:24.115 --> 02:25:26.551
THIS ISSUE TO SIT TO MEASURE OF

02:25:26.617 --> 02:25:28.519
SUCCESS OR FAILURE IF SINCE IT'S

02:25:28.586 --> 02:25:30.254
NOT A SYSTEM WIDE.

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:33.591
APPROACH HOW DO WE KNOW WHETHER.

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:34.759
CAMPUSES ARE SUCCEEDING OR

02:25:34.826 --> 02:25:36.160
FAILING.

02:25:36.227 --> 02:25:38.496
SO WE'RE WORKING ON EVALUATION

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.064
NOW OF SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE

02:25:40.131 --> 02:25:41.199
IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF

02:25:41.265 --> 02:25:42.567
REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THE

02:25:42.633 --> 02:25:45.136
IMPACT IS IN LOOKING AT METRICS

02:25:45.203 --> 02:25:46.671
THAT ARE BEING CAPTURED WITH THE

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:48.039
BASIC NEEDS WORK.

02:25:48.106 --> 02:25:49.474
AND HOW THAT OVERLAP SOME SOME

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.808
OF THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS

02:25:50.875 --> 02:25:52.376
INDICATORS SO WE'RE JUST IN THE

02:25:52.443 --> 02:25:54.278
BEGINNING STAGES OF FRAMING THAT

02:25:54.345 --> 02:25:54.645
OUT.

02:25:54.712 --> 02:25:57.215
AT OUR ANALYSIS REFLECTS THAT OF

02:25:57.281 --> 02:25:59.283
THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO CREATE AN

02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:02.353
RFP ASSOCIATE WITH THE

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:03.354
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- TO

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:05.056
INCLUDE A HOUSING COMPONENT WHAT

02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:06.557
SORT OF HOUSING COMPONENT.

02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:09.494
THIS DO YOU IN THE SYSTEM FOLKS

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:10.728
ANTICIPATE SO WE'VE BEEN IN

02:26:10.795 --> 02:26:12.964
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A RAPID RE

02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:15.700
HOUSING TYPE MODEL -- WHERE WE

02:26:15.766 --> 02:26:17.902
WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK CAMPUS IS

02:26:17.969 --> 02:26:19.937
WE'D BE ABLE -- TO CREATE A

02:26:20.004 --> 02:26:21.906
SYSTEM WHERE A STUDENT WOULD BE

02:26:21.973 --> 02:26:24.375
A UC STUDENT NEED WOULD BE ABLE

02:26:24.442 --> 02:26:26.010
TO APPLY TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS

02:26:26.077 --> 02:26:27.745
RAPID RE HOUSING WHERE.

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:29.480
THEY WOULD GET THREE TO SIX

02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:32.016
MONTHS OF FINDING -- THAT WOULD

02:26:32.083 --> 02:26:33.851
ALLOW THEM TO MOVE IN AND THEN

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:36.287
HOPEFULLY BUILD UP OVER THOSE

02:26:36.354 --> 02:26:36.921
THREE TO SIX MONTHS WHERE THEY

02:26:36.988 --> 02:26:37.788
WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THE

02:26:37.855 --> 02:26:38.856
RENT ON THEIR OWN.

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.858
WHEN WE HIS WE HAVE AT LEAST ONE

02:26:40.925 --> 02:26:44.462
LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE -- THAT

02:26:44.529 --> 02:26:45.496
IS -- ALIGNED WITH THAT EFFORT

02:26:45.563 --> 02:26:46.797
AS WELL.

02:26:46.864 --> 02:26:48.966
A MENTAL HEALTH.

02:26:49.033 --> 02:26:50.668
FIVE I'M SURE YOU SAW OUR AGENDA

02:26:50.735 --> 02:26:53.171
AND THE ANALYSIS AND I WAS.

02:26:53.237 --> 02:26:57.241
READING IT AND I WAS -- SOMEWHAT

02:26:57.308 --> 02:26:59.310
SURPRISED IN A LITTLE CONCERNED

02:26:59.377 --> 02:27:02.813
ABOUT THE SURVEY RESULTS -- AND

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:04.949
I'M NOT A MATH PERSON WHICH IS

02:27:05.016 --> 02:27:06.017
WHY I'M.

02:27:06.083 --> 02:27:08.486
AN ATTORNEY I GUESS BUT WHEN I

02:27:08.553 --> 02:27:09.854
WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE SURVEY

02:27:09.921 --> 02:27:11.622
RESULTS IN THE PERCENTAGES FOR

02:27:11.689 --> 02:27:13.424
HOSE STUDENTS WHO WERE SELF

02:27:13.491 --> 02:27:16.294
REPORTING -- INTENTIONAL SELF

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.995
HARM OR AT LEAST CONSIDERATION

02:27:18.062 --> 02:27:19.630
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING SUICIDE

02:27:19.697 --> 02:27:22.300
ATTEMPT SUICIDE IT TOTALS ALMOST

02:27:22.366 --> 02:27:24.101
TOTAL 20% [inaudible]

02:27:24.168 --> 02:27:29.307
OF WHAT PLANS.

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:31.442
DOES THE SYSTEM HAVE TO TRY TO

02:27:31.509 --> 02:27:34.245
ADDRESS THIS AND SPECIFICALLY.

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:37.615
JUST TO ASK A COMPOUND QUESTION --

02:27:37.682 --> 02:27:39.350
OR WERE YOU PLANNING TO ADD

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:41.118
ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS WITH

02:27:41.185 --> 02:27:42.486
RESPECT TO THE GOVERNOR'S

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:44.055
PROPOSAL AND THE AMOUNT IT'S

02:27:44.121 --> 02:27:45.790
GOING TO BE PROVIDED AT LEAST

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:47.258
PROPOSED TO BE PROVIDED.

02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:48.826
DO YOU NEED MORE MONEY FOR

02:27:48.893 --> 02:27:51.329
COUNSELORS TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:27:51.395 --> 02:27:53.197
THESE STUDENT NEEDS.

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:54.932
OF THE FACILITIES THAT YOU DO

02:27:54.999 --> 02:27:57.368
HAVE -- ON CAMPUSES ARE THERE

02:27:57.435 --> 02:28:00.037
SIGNIFICANT WAIT TIMES.

02:28:00.104 --> 02:28:02.807
FOR SERVICES AND ARE THEY'RE

02:28:02.873 --> 02:28:05.910
SUFFICIENT -- PSYCHIATRISTS AND

02:28:05.977 --> 02:28:07.712
COUNSELORS.

02:28:07.778 --> 02:28:10.448
PSYCHOLOGISTS -- SOCIAL WORKERS

02:28:10.514 --> 02:28:12.817
AVAILABLE. TO TO DEAL WITH

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:16.220
STUDENTS WHO ARE IN CRISIS.

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:18.289
A LOT OF QUESTIONS YES I I'M

02:28:18.356 --> 02:28:20.324
HAPPY TO BREAK THEM UP IF I CAN

02:28:20.391 --> 02:28:24.895
REMEMBER THE SO WAIT TIMES

02:28:24.962 --> 02:28:27.131
ACROSS OUR SYSTEM DO VERY -- IF

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:29.066
A STUDENT IS IN CRISIS THEY'RE

02:28:29.133 --> 02:28:30.868
ABLE TO GET IN TO SEE SOMEONE

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:33.237
USUALLY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS

02:28:33.304 --> 02:28:34.338
IF NOT SOONER.

02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:37.575
IF A STUDENT COMES IN AND ME ARE

02:28:37.642 --> 02:28:39.677
ASSESSED AS NOT BEING IN CRISIS

02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:41.812
THEN VERY WAIT TIMES CAN VARY

02:28:41.879 --> 02:28:44.548
FROM A DAY OR TWO TWO WEEKS.

02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:45.750
SO THAT'S WHERE THE VARIATION

02:28:45.816 --> 02:28:47.685
REALLY LIVE IF A STUDENT COMES

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:49.587
THAT AND THEY'RE IN CRISIS RIGHT

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:50.955
THAT IN THERE AND THERE IS TEST

02:28:51.022 --> 02:28:52.256
AS BEING IN CRISIS.

02:28:52.323 --> 02:28:53.557
THEY ARE ABLE TO SEE SOMEONE

02:28:53.624 --> 02:28:55.259
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MOST OF OUR

02:28:55.326 --> 02:28:58.929
CAMPUSES DO YOU HAVE A PERSON

02:28:58.996 --> 02:29:00.431
THAT ROTATES THROUGH.

02:29:00.498 --> 02:29:01.932
ACCOUNTS THAT ROTATES THROUGH

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:03.534
THAT IS ABLE TO WITH THE EIGHTH

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:05.503
A STUDENT THAT COMES THEN THAT

02:29:05.569 --> 02:29:07.405
IS IN CRISIS AND THAT IS AS FAST

02:29:07.471 --> 02:29:09.707
AND CRISIS TO HELP THEM RIGHT

02:29:09.774 --> 02:29:10.608
THEN AND THERE.

02:29:10.675 --> 02:29:12.076
DOES THIS ASSESSMENT OCCUR.

02:29:12.143 --> 02:29:14.912
IN A STUDENT HEALTH CENTER IS A

02:29:14.979 --> 02:29:15.513
YES.

02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:16.447
AND I REALIZETHE ISSUE IS IN A

02:29:16.514 --> 02:29:17.014
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:18.282
MAYBE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:20.217
POSITION THAN THE THAN THE UC

02:29:20.284 --> 02:29:21.352

UC HAS HOUSES HEALTH CENTERS AND

02:29:24.722 --> 02:29:28.659
HOSPITALS AND UC HEALTH PLAN ALL

02:29:28.726 --> 02:29:31.028
OF THAT THAT DOES NOT EXIST ON

02:29:31.095 --> 02:29:32.730
THIS IN THE CSU SYSTEM IN ON

02:29:32.797 --> 02:29:34.332
YOUR CAMPUSES SO IT'S A SLIGHTLY

02:29:34.398 --> 02:29:36.634
DIFFERENT.

02:29:36.701 --> 02:29:37.902
A SITUATION.

02:29:37.968 --> 02:29:40.538
SOON THAT YOUR OF FACILITY YOU

02:29:40.604 --> 02:29:42.406
HAVE LET FEWER FACILITIES AND

02:29:42.473 --> 02:29:43.841
PERSONNEL TO TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:46.744
SORTS OF SITUATIONS JUST BECAUSE

02:29:46.811 --> 02:29:50.915
YOU'RE NOT A MEDICAL TRAINING.

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:51.682
OFTEN INSTITUTION.

02:29:51.749 --> 02:29:53.818
OUR SYSTE [inaudible]

02:29:53.884 --> 02:29:55.920
CORRECT OKAY [inaudible]

02:29:55.986 --> 02:29:58.222
WELL OBVIOUSLY.

02:29:58.289 --> 02:29:59.724
MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE VERY

02:29:59.790 --> 02:30:00.658
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELL

02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:03.127
BEING OF STUDENTS.

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:05.529
AND I REALIZE BASED ON WHAT I

02:30:05.596 --> 02:30:08.399
READ WHAT PEOPLE TELL ME -- EVEN

02:30:08.466 --> 02:30:10.034
THOUGH I AM AS OLD AS METHUSELAH

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:12.069
THAT SITUATIONS HAVE CHANGED IN

02:30:12.136 --> 02:30:13.871
EDUCATION TODAY.

02:30:13.938 --> 02:30:15.473
IN ON CAMPUSES AND IN PARTICULAR

02:30:15.539 --> 02:30:17.141

02:30:17.208 --> 02:30:19.944
CAMPUSES AND STUDENTS ARE UNDERS.

02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:21.579
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STRESS AND

02:30:21.645 --> 02:30:23.280
THAT STRESS CAN SOMETIMES.

02:30:23.347 --> 02:30:24.715
MOVE INTO MORE SERIOUS

02:30:24.782 --> 02:30:26.884
SITUATIONS SO WE WANT TO MAKE

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:28.319
SURE THAT YOU ARE PROPERLY

02:30:28.386 --> 02:30:31.589
RESOURCE -- BOTH IN TERMS OF

02:30:31.655 --> 02:30:34.125
FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL TO DEAL

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:35.326
WITH THIS CRISIS.

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:38.596
SOME STUDENTS FIND THEMSELVES IN.

02:30:38.662 --> 02:30:39.697
AND THAT'S WHY I ASK ABOUT

02:30:39.764 --> 02:30:40.664
WAITING TIMES THAT'S WHY ASK

02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:45.035
ABOUT -- COUNSELORS AND

02:30:45.102 --> 02:30:47.004
PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:48.406
I'D BE INTERESTED IN IF YOU

DIDN'T YOU MENTIONED THAT I

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:50.508
MISSED IT.

02:30:50.574 --> 02:30:51.876
YOU KNOW THE VACANCY RATE ARE

02:30:51.942 --> 02:30:53.811
YOU ABLE TO RECRUIT TO THE

02:30:53.878 --> 02:30:55.312
EXTENT THAT THESE YOU SEE ISSUE

02:30:55.379 --> 02:30:55.813
HOLLY'S.

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:57.815
RECRUIT TO FILL THE POSITIONS

02:30:57.882 --> 02:31:00.418
THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:01.018
WITH THE FUNDING THAT YOU ARE

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:01.952
PROVIDED.

02:31:02.019 --> 02:31:03.053
AND IF THERE'S A VACANCY

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:08.826
SITUATION HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT.

02:31:08.893 --> 02:31:10.060
YEAH BUT I DON'T THINK WE EITHER

02:31:10.127 --> 02:31:11.862
OF US HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON ON

02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:13.697
VACANCY RATES IN AND TURN AROUND

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:16.033
ON THOSE BUT BUT JUST FROM A

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:17.067
JUST COMING FROM A FUNDING

02:31:17.134 --> 02:31:19.236
PERSPECTIVE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:20.671
AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:23.107
GENERALLY SPEAKING ORIGINALLY --

02:31:23.174 --> 02:31:24.842
THE THE C. ISSUE OF HEALTH AND

02:31:24.909 --> 02:31:25.743
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE

02:31:25.810 --> 02:31:27.211
SUPPORTED BY GENERAL FUND WAY

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:28.879
BACK DECADES AGO.

02:31:28.946 --> 02:31:30.815
BUT OVER TIME WITH REPEATED

02:31:30.881 --> 02:31:32.750
RECESSIONS AND YOU KNOW

02:31:32.817 --> 02:31:34.285
REDUCTIONS TO THE C. ISSUE.

02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:36.487
THAT IS REALLY MY REALLY CHANGED

02:31:36.554 --> 02:31:38.155
TO A MODEL WHERE IT'S A FEE FOR

02:31:38.222 --> 02:31:41.459
SERVICE -- SORT OF MODEL SO --

02:31:41.525 --> 02:31:42.927
TYPICALLY IT'S A FEE THAT IS

02:31:42.993 --> 02:31:44.361
ASSESSED ACROSS AN ENTIRE --

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:46.964
CAMPUS TO FUND THE HEALTH

02:31:47.031 --> 02:31:48.232
SERVICES AS WELL AS A MENTAL

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:49.934
HEALTH SERVICES THERE IS A

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.135
LITTLE BIT A GENERAL FUND.

02:31:51.202 --> 02:31:52.069
STILL REMAINING ON SOME CAN'T

02:31:52.136 --> 02:31:54.505
SOME CAMPUSES THAT SUPPORT --

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:55.072
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND

02:31:55.139 --> 02:31:56.140
HEALTH SERVICES THE

02:31:56.207 --> 02:31:57.508
PREDOMINATELY IT'S A IT'S A FEE

02:31:57.575 --> 02:31:59.310
THAT'S THAT STUDENTS PAY FOR

02:31:59.376 --> 02:32:04.715
EACH AND EVERY YEAR -- IT WAS --

02:32:04.782 --> 02:32:05.850
LIMITATIONS ON WHICH YOU CAN

02:32:05.916 --> 02:32:07.451
CHARGE IS A STUDENT I ASSUME IN

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:08.919
FEET NOT STATUTORILY IN IT AND

02:32:08.986 --> 02:32:09.887
IT BECAUSE WE ARE IN BECAUSE WE

02:32:09.954 --> 02:32:11.121
ARE KIND OF A LOOSE

02:32:11.188 --> 02:32:12.690
CONFEDERATION OF UNIVERSITIES

02:32:12.756 --> 02:32:13.357
RIGHT THERE ARE.

02:32:13.424 --> 02:32:14.892
THERE ARE DIFFERENT -- RATES

02:32:14.959 --> 02:32:16.927
THAT ARE THAT ARE -- COLLECTED

02:32:16.994 --> 02:32:19.029
ON THE TO THE CAMPUSES AND SOME

02:32:19.096 --> 02:32:21.298
OF THAT IS REALLY DEPENDENT ON

02:32:21.365 --> 02:32:23.367
LOCAL OF FACILITIES ARE

02:32:23.434 --> 02:32:25.102
AVAILABLE RIGHT SO YOU'RE GONNA

02:32:25.169 --> 02:32:26.937
HAVE FOR EXAMPLE CAN OF HEALTH

02:32:27.004 --> 02:32:28.272
SERVICES FEES AT A HIGHER AND

02:32:28.339 --> 02:32:30.541
HIGHER COST A BIT HUMBLE BECAUSE

02:32:30.608 --> 02:32:31.942
THERE AREN'T SO MANY -- SEARCH

02:32:32.009 --> 02:32:34.144
COMMUNITY SERVICES AVAILABLE TO

02:32:34.211 --> 02:32:35.813
THEM CONVERSELY IT'S IT'S LOWER

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:40.084
IN OTHER AREAS SO JUST WANT TO

02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:41.018
LET YOU KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:42.052
WHAT DID HE SAID DESCRIBING.

02:32:42.119 --> 02:32:44.188
WITH -- THE LEVEL OF SERVICE

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:45.222
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND

02:32:45.289 --> 02:32:47.324
WE THINK THAT THAT WERE ABLE TO

02:32:47.391 --> 02:32:47.992
PROVIDE IT AT A AT A CRITICAL

02:32:48.058 --> 02:32:49.126
POINT WHEN IT'S NECESSARY.

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:51.195
WE DO SUPPORT THAT WITH A

02:32:51.262 --> 02:32:52.429
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW

02:32:52.496 --> 02:32:53.731
BASS LINE FUNDING.

02:32:53.797 --> 02:32:54.765
THROUGH THESE FEES SO THAT

02:32:54.832 --> 02:32:56.500
STUDENTS CAN HAVE THE SERVICE

02:32:56.567 --> 02:32:57.868
THAT THEY NEED.

02:32:57.935 --> 02:32:59.370
AND OBVIOUSLY I'M SURE FINANCE.

02:32:59.436 --> 02:33:01.005
IS ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE OF OF

02:33:01.071 --> 02:33:02.706
SOME SOMEBODY ELSE OR SOMETHING

02:33:02.773 --> 02:33:04.241
ELSE RELIEVING PRESSURE ON THE

02:33:04.308 --> 02:33:06.210
GENERAL FUND BUDGET BUT I THINK

02:33:06.277 --> 02:33:08.479
THIS ISSUE IS IS EXTREMELY

02:33:08.546 --> 02:33:12.416
CRITICAL AND I GUESS MY COMMENT --

02:33:12.483 --> 02:33:15.052
IS IF THE STUDENT FEE FUNDING IS

02:33:15.119 --> 02:33:17.521
NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE.

02:33:17.588 --> 02:33:18.556
BECAUSE THEIR PRACTICAL

02:33:18.622 --> 02:33:20.157
LIMITATIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF

02:33:20.224 --> 02:33:21.592
THAT THAT CAN BE SUPPLIED FROM

02:33:21.659 --> 02:33:23.260
STUDENTS.

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:24.962
IF THE STUDENT FEE FUNDING IS

02:33:25.029 --> 02:33:26.397
NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:29.333
LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:31.302
THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS

02:33:31.368 --> 02:33:33.337
IN THE STATE I THINK WE OWE IT

02:33:33.404 --> 02:33:34.872
TO THE STUDENTS.

02:33:34.939 --> 02:33:37.074
TO EXPLORE AUGMENTING THAT --

02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:39.043
EVEN IF HISTORICALLY WE'VE MOVED

02:33:39.109 --> 02:33:40.644
AWAY FROM THAT I THINK IT'S TOO

02:33:40.711 --> 02:33:44.114
IMPORTANT -- TO ALLOW.

02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:46.717
THE STUDENTS TO REMAIN IN CRISIS --

02:33:46.784 --> 02:33:49.787
OR EVEN DEVELOPING CRISIS --

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:52.056
WITHOUT EXAMINING WHETHER WE CAN

02:33:52.122 --> 02:33:53.557
AUGMENT THAT WAS SOME GENERAL

02:33:53.624 --> 02:33:55.292
FUND SO WILL DEPEND ON THE

02:33:55.359 --> 02:33:58.062
SYSTEM TO LET US KNOW -- WHAT

02:33:58.128 --> 02:33:59.063
YOU'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE WITH THE

02:33:59.129 --> 02:34:00.097
FUNDING THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET

02:34:00.164 --> 02:34:01.999
FROM YOUR STUDENTS AND DIVERT

02:34:02.066 --> 02:34:03.467
FROM OTHER?

02:34:03.534 --> 02:34:05.903
RESOURCES ON THESE CAMPUSES.

02:34:05.970 --> 02:34:07.571
AND IF THERE'S ADULTERER

02:34:07.638 --> 02:34:10.474
SHORTFALL -- LET US KNOW SO WE

02:34:10.541 --> 02:34:12.576
CAN EXPLORE OF TURNS

02:34:12.643 --> 02:34:12.876
[inaudible]

02:34:12.943 --> 02:34:15.646
