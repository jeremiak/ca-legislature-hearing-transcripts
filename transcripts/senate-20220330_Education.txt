HAVE BEEN PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR BEFORE WE HEAR PRESENTATION ON THE BILLS LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL HERE THE TROUBLED HERE COURTESY YOUR CORTES A HERE DALLI. DALLI HEAR GLAZER. AS OUR HERE MCGUIRE PAN. THE COURT VERY GOOD WE HAVE A QUORUM PRESENT AND WE WILL GO TO OUR FIRST BILL WHICH IS SENATOR PORTANTINO WITH SB NINE OH SIX SENATOR BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TODAY I AM PRESENTING SB NINE OH SIX WHICH WILL HELP TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN BY ADDRESSING THE TRAGIC INCREASE IN SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ON CAMPUSES. EVERY STUDENT EVERY TEACHER EVERY ADMINISTRATOR EVERY STAFF MEMBER AND EVERY VISITOR TO A SCHOOL EVERY VOLUNTEER. SHOULD GO TO WORK ON A CAMPUS IN THE MORNING AND SAFELY COME HOME IN THE AFTERNOON. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THERE BEEN A HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN CALIFORNIA. HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR. AND I'M HOPING THAT WE SEE IN OUR LAST ONE. BUT IT'S BEEN SAID THAT HOPE ISN'T A STRATEGY. IN THIS CASE HOPE ISN'T A STRATEGY. WE MUST DO MORE TO PROTECT OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ON OUR SCHOOL SITES. WELL CALIFORNIA'S ADOPTED STRONG FIREARMS STORAGE SAFETY LAWS IN APPROXIMATELY 68% AT SCHOOLS THE FIREARM WAS TAKEN FROM THE STUDENTS HOME FRIEND OR RELATIVE. MANY PARENTS ALSO WRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT KNOW THE LOCATION OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD FIREARMS CHILDREN OUT. IN NINETEEN SB NINE OH SIX WILL REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF HOUSEHOLD FIREARMS AND INCLUDE INFORMATION ON SAFE FIREARM STORAGE LAWS. THESE MEASURES WILL INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND AWARENESS OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE. NUMBER ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM IS THE DISREGARD OF WARNING SIGNS BEFORE AN INCIDENT AS WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IN THE TRAGEDY IN MICHIGAN. IN ALMOST EVERY CASE OF A SCHOOL SHOOTING THERE WAS A CLEAR WARNING SIGNS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT KNOWING THE SIGNS OF GUN VIOLENCE CAN PREVENT IT. IN PLAN THEIR ATTACK IN ADVANCE. MOST MADE THREATENING OR CONCERNING COMMUNICATIONS TO PARENTS FRIENDS OR EDUCATORS. LET'S BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT AN ROTC CLASS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A GAMER. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ITER CHECK IDLE CHATTER. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A CREDIBLE THREAT. THIS BILL WILL AUTHORIZE CONCERNED SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO ACT ON THESE CREDIBLE FIREARM THREATS AND AGAIN LET'S BE CLEAR. WE'RE NOT EXPANDING ANYBODY'S RIGHTS OR PRIVILEGES WERE NOT GIVING EXTRA SORRY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE AGAIN LET'S TAKE MICHIGAN FOR EXAMPLE. THEY HAD THE AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE THEY DIDN'T SAME IN CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO. THIS BILL WILL AUTHORIZE AUTHORIZED. CONSIDERED SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO ACT ON A CREDIBLE THREAT NOT GIVE THEM EXTRA AUTHORITIES TO DO SO IT JUST WILL AUTHORIZE THEM TO ACT ON THOSE THREATS. PRIORITIZING THE SAFETY OF STUDENTS BY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY ENSURING SAFE AT HOME FIREARM STORAGE AND ALLOWING A PERCEIVED THREAT THREAT TO BE PROPERLY INVESTIGATED. IS CRUCIAL TO LESSENING THE CHANCE OF TRAGEDY LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR ON WHO WOULD BE DOING THE INVESTIGATION WE'RE NOT ASKING TEACHERS WE'RE NOT ASKING ADMINISTRATORS WERE ASKING THOSE. SWORN AND THOSE TRAINED LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL TO DO THEIR JOB WHEN THEY RECEIVE A CREDIBLE THREAT THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF FOLKS TO THE- WE'RE GONNA FORCE TEACHERS TO GO SEARCH A LOCKER NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE INSTITUTIONS TO ENGAGE IN THIS ROBUST AND PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS BILL. MY STAFF AND I HAVE BEEN DILIGENTLY WORKING TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED AND TO TIGHTEN AND IMPROVE THE BILL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ASSURE THOSE WHO WORK ON OUR CAMPUSES. AS I SAID WE'RE NOT INTENDING TO HAVE THEM DO THIS WORK WE'RE ASKING THE TRAINED AND SWORN OFFICERS TO BE TASKED WITH THE INVESTIGATION. TO THAT END SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS WE'RE NEGOTIATING AND WE'LL BE TAKING IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE SHOULD THE BILL ADVANCED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS DOCTOR PAT RAISED A VERY IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS. YOU KNOW I DON'T CHATTER AND TEENAGERS THREATENED SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS SUPPLY. THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. WE'RE GOING TO AMEND THE LAND. TO DISCLOSE WHAT WE WANTED TO FOCUS N UNREGISTERED GUNS WE RECOGNIZE THE DOJ HAS INFORMATION HAS A DATABASE. UNREGISTERED GUNS SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE UNREGISTERED GUNS- AND WE'RE HOPING. TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THAT PIECE AS WELL- WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TAKE- OUT THERE'S A LOT SECTION IN THERE TO TALK ABOUT DISOBEDIENCE OF SCHOOL RULES AND POLICIES WE WANT TO FOCUS STRICTLY ON CREDIBLE VIOLENT THREATS SO WE'RE GONNA NARROW THAT LANGUAGE AS WELL AS THIS BILL HOPEFULLY MOVES OUT TODAY. I'M AGAIN I WANT TO REPEAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT CONDUCTING ANY INVESTIGATION NOT TEACHERS STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING O BE TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE WE'RE CLEAR. THAT THIS IS ABOUT CREDIBLE VIOLENT THREATS NOT ABOUT IDLE CHATTER NOT ABOUT A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO ROTC MEMBERS ABOUT GUN TRAINING THIS IS ABOUT THREATS I CONTINUE TO BE REMAIN OPEN TO FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND FRANKLY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ACCESS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER- STAKEHOLDERS- AND WE BELIEVE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GONNA. MEET MOST IF NOT ALL OF THEIR REQUEST FRANKLY IN THE WAKE OF THE DETAILS RAISED IN MICHIGAN. WE HAVE TO DO MORE. AS A DAD ISN'T POLICY MAKER I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP TO MORNING NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT OF ANOTHER TRAGEDY KNOWING THAT WE COULD HAVE A BOULDER TAKING BOLDER STEPS TO INVESTIGATE CREDIBLE THREATS ON OUR CAMPUSES AND THAT WE DIDN'T DO IT. FRANKLY I COULD SEE AND I UNDERSTAND AN ADMINISTRATOR BEING HAMSTRUNG BY THE THOUGHT THIS WON'T HAPPEN HERE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITY WHAT IF WE'RE WRONG WHAT IF WE OVER REACT. WILL ANGER PARENTS IF WE INVESTIGATED CHILD AND WERE WRONG. YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO AVOID THAT HESITATION WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE I'D RATHER THEY BLAME ME I'D RATHER THEY GET MAD AT ME FOR FORCING THIS INVESTIGATION IN THE WAKE UP AND READ IN A NEWSPAPER THAT WE COULD HAVE AVERTED A TRAGEDY. SO TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY SUPPORT MARGOT BENNETT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WOMEN AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONVERSE WITH THE COMMITTEE AND HOPEFULLY THIS BILL COULD MOVE TO ITS NEXT STOP AND WE CAN MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY THANK.

IN MEDICARE AND NOT FOR THEIR LINES IN OPPOSITION VERY GOOD THANK YOU MR MODERATOR ALL RIGHT WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE YES YES SENATE ALI. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I. TODAY I'M GONNA BE OPPOSE IN THE LEGISLATION THAT IS HERE- AND I JUST WANNA SHARE THAT- SOMEBODY WHO IS- PERUT AND ALSO- NO MY WIFE SAID ON THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR A LONG TIME AND IN KEEPING STUDENTS SAFE IS. IS A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL- IN ITS FORM IS GOING TO DO IT IT'S- THE AUTHOR THINKS IT'S GOING TO DO NUMBER ONE I THINK IT INFRINGES ON- GUN OWNERS RIGHTS WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT ARE. WE ARE REQUIRED HAVE THOSE IN THE SAFE OR LOCKED- WE ARE FREE YOU'RE FULLY BY A FIREARM IT IS REGISTERED WE ARE FINGERPRINTED THERE'S A BACKGROUND CHECK YEAH DONE IN CALIFORNIA- SO THERE'S A LOT OF ALREADY LAWS ON THE BOOKS ABOUT PEOPLE KNOWING WHO HAS- FIREARMS BUT THIS WOULD- I THINK IT BRIDGE THE RIGHTS ON THE STUDENTS AS WELL- I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR LAST. AUG AWESOME BILL THAT- I THOUGHT WILL DO ACTUALLY MORE FOR- HELPING KEEPING STUDENTS SAFE IT WAS THE BILL THAT- WE WOULD EDUCATE THE SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS THE- CAFETERIA WORKER. EVERYONE THAT IS IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT IS- DEALING WITH KIDS TO IDENTIFY WHEN THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THEY MAY NEED COUNSELING AND THAT I THINK THAT BILL WHICH I SAID HOLY SUPPORT ELECTED I'M I'M REALLY SADDENED TO SEE THAT IT IT GOT HUNG UP IN THE ASSEMBLY AND GETTING GET OUT AND GET SIGNED INTO LAW BECAUSE- THAT BILL ACTUALLY. I BELIEVE WOULD DO A LOT MORE THAN THIS BILL AND SO- THIS BILL IS A LOT OF WORK I THINK IT INFRINGES ON THE RIGHTS OF- PARENTS AND STUDENTS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE OPPOSING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY CENTER CHAU BOOK. SO VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I'VE ALSO BEEN IN SUPPORT OF YOUR PASSED BILLS WITH WITH REGARDS TO OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND I THINK AS I'VE EXPRESSED IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEES IS. THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONCERNS AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE'VE BEEN SUCH PARTNERS ON ON LEGISLATION THAT. PROVIDES RESOURCES- IN OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AT HAND BUT I- WAS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I LIKE TO LISTEN TO WITNESSES VERY CAREFULLY TO SEE WHAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE. AND I EAT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HOW YOU WOULD RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT- THIS BILL AND IN MIND YOU I THINK THE TITLE IS VERY- WHAT'S THE WORD- LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT IT DOES VIOLATE VIOLATE- MANY OF THE AT CONSTITUTIONAL- VOIGTS RIGHT BUT IT IT DOES IN THE SENSE THAT I AM COGNISANT OF THAT THE DOJ ALREADY HAS. 80% OF THE DATA ON- GUN OWNERSHIP REGISTERED GUNS- AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT I'M PROPOSING TO TAKE IS THAT WE NARROWED THE REGISTRY PIECE BECAUSE WE HAVE SEARCH AND SEIZURE PIECE- WHICH- I THINK. I WAS. SUBJECT TO SOME OF THE PASSION WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY OF THE LAWS ARE RIGHT TO PRIVILEGES THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO SEARCH PROPERTY SO WE'RE NOT EXPANDING THAT SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES THERE- AND SO I THINK WE'RE ON SOLID CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS AND AGAIN I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS AND- TRYING TO WORK WITH FOLKS AS YOU HEARD EVEN SOME OF THE OPPOSERS WERE IN MY OPINION QUITE SORT OF SOFT IN SOME OF THEIR OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN GOOD FAITH- WITH THEM TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. AND I THINK IN THE END THAT THEY WERE GOING TO ADDRESS ALL OF. SO I THINK. EVERYBODY WAS SCHOOL SAFETY AND IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE IF THERE WAS ANY SORT OF THREAT IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHY IN CALIFORNIA WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS NEEDED- EVEN IN A MODIFIED. VERSION DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ALREADY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. WHAT WE HAVE AS HUMAN NATURE- AND BEING AT. SCHOOL PARENT MYSELF BEING A MEMBER OF MANY SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS I'VE BEEN IN ROOMS WHERE PARENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS SAID. WELL THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY I THINK THAT'S A NORMAL HUMAN TRAIT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT ON OUR STREET OR WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THAT HESITANCY THAT I UNDERSTAND AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN. YOU KNOW YOU CAN NEVER. YOU CAN NEVER PREDICT WHEN YOU'VE PERFECTED SOMETHING. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PREVENTED. DO I BELIEVE THIS WILL PREVENT HIV YES IF I DIDN'T I WOULDN'T PROPOSE IT. AS A PARENT OR LEGISLATOR I DON'T WANT TO READ A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE. THAT HAS DETAILS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN. IS IT GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW I DON'T KNOW WILL HAPPEN TEN YEARS FROM NOW I DON'T KNOW. BUT THE POINT IS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY. TO TAKE PRUDENT STEPS. TO SAY TO ADMINISTRATORS. WE WANT TO LESSEN YOUR BURDEN. BY COMPELLING YOU TO INVESTIGATE ONLY WHEN THERE'S A CREDIBLE THREAT AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE MISS. INTERPRETING WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. IDLE CHATTER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE THREATS THAT WE KNOW TO BE REAL. THAT MIGHT FOR SOMEBODY TO TAKE IN ACTION BECAUSE IT WON'T HAPPEN COMMUNITY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS- TO THE CHAIR DO WE HAVE ANYBODY FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- THAT COULD ANSWER A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO. POLICY IN IN ACTUALLY. PURSUING A POTENTIAL THREAT AS I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYONE HERE FROM NEOVIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH ACCESS- AND THEY'VE GIVEN US A NUMBER OF THEIR CONCERNS AND I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS- I THINK WE'RE GONNA ACT OF EVENTUALLY ADDRESS ALL OF THEM- SO. YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T COME UP IN OPPOSE IT TODAY AND SO I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN GOOD FAITH I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I'M CONFIDENT ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AND I BELIEVE- CHECKED WITH MY STAFF. ACCESS CONCERNS WERE VERY SIMILAR THE ONES EXPRESSED BY RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHICH I KNOW YOU REPRESENT YEAH AND THAT'S YOU KNOW I HAVE A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY THAT HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL NEEDS A LITTLE MORE TIME TO WORK WITH THAT- THIS TIME AROUND OR SHOULD WE COME BACK TO IT- MAYBE NEXT YEAR- WITH SOME OF THE WORK ALREADY IN PLACE BECAUSE I THINK RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE A LOT OF HESITATION FROM MANY STAKEHOLDERS WITH REGARD TO THE LANGUAGE WITHOUT SEEING AND I KNOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND I'VE BEEN IN. YOU KNOW PARTNER BEFORE IN TRYING TO GET THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORKABLE I'M MOVING FORWARD BUT JUST FROM RIGHT NOW- SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY SOMEONE FROM. MY SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE- THROUGH THE CHAIR WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE THEM WHERE ARE THEY JEFF BARKER. WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING SENATE OF BOTH- WHAT THE CONCERNS MAY BE THAT M.

MANAGER WITH YOUR PERMISSION PLEASE PROCEED- JEFF PARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN THE TWENTY THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUPERINTENDENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. YES YOU DO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR IT IS YES- NOT LIKELY ANYTHING THAT GOES TO THE LEVEL OF Y. CENTER PORTANTINO IS PROPOSING AND HIS BILL- HI. AS HE HAS NOTED- A WE ARE WORKING WITH ACCESS- ON THEIR CONCERNS AND- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING WELL. AND THAT IS THAT IS WHY DID NOT COME UP TODAY BECAUSE- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE- YOU KNOW HOW HOW THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD A FOUR WEEK- ACTUALLY ADOPTED OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOPEFULLY THAT HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS BECAUSE AGAIN IT SHOWS THE GOOD FAITH THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH BOTH RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND ACCESS. OKAY AND MANAGER IF I COULD COME IN ON THE OTHER ISSUE IF THIS WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF A TWO YEAR SESSION I WOULD TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S. LET'S WORK ON IT BUT GIVEN THAT IT'S DOUBLE REFERRED IN. THE TIMELINE AND- FRANK I WAS HOPING TO GET. YOU KNOW GET MORE SPECIFICS FEEDBACK YOU KNOW TO THIS POINT. AND I APPRECIATE THOSE THAT HAVE HAVE HAVE GIVEN IT. SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO KEEP THE BALL MOVING TO HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO- ACTUALLY TWO MORE COMMITTEE SO THERE'S AMPLE TIME IN THE SENATE. TAKE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION FOR YOU TO SEE THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE. AS THIS HOPEFULLY MOVES TODAY- SO IT'S NOT GONNA COME TO THE FLOOR TOMORROW SO THERE'S TWO MORE COMMITTEES. IN THE SENATE ITSELF SENATOR JOE BOOKS CENTER GLAZER AN INCENTIVE. THANK YOU- CENTER PORTANTINO THE- THE CLARION CALL FROM YOUR OPENING REMARKS- IT CERTAINLY RAIN- WITH GREAT FORCE FOR ME IS THAT THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE. THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE AFTER ALL THESE TRAGEDIES YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS SARAH HEARTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT- AND WE PLEDGE TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING TO. MAKE IT NOT HAPPEN AGAIN- A BILL LIKE THIS DOES HAVE A DIFFICULT PATH THERE ARE MANY. RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAVE TO BE BALANCED AND I APPRECIATE HOW HARD IT IS BUT- I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO GET INTO THAT BREACH. AND CONSTRUCTIVELY TRY TO FIND THAT THAT BALANCE IN THAT PATHWAY. NO EVEN IN THE QUIET OF THIS. HEARING ROOM. I CAN STILL HEAR THE CRIES OF. FIVE MILLION PARENTS- I CAN I CAN SEE THE TEARS FLOWING DOWN THEIR FACES AYE HI CAN HEAR THEIR MEMORIAL PRAYERS ABOUT A YOUNG LIFE. CUT SHORT- AND I AND I KNOW THAT WE ALL SHARE THAT. GRIEF WE ALL SHARE THAT GRIEF. BUT I WOULD SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT. SENATOR PORTANTINO IS AT CONSTRUCTIVELY TRYING TO FIND A PATH I THINK WE SHOULD GIVEN THE CHANCE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT I THINK THAT WE WILL HAVE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SAY THAT NO THIS DOESN'T DO ENOUGH FOR GO AS FAR AS WE'D LIKE WE HAVE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES. GOING FORWARD I WE KNOW ALL THE HURDLES THAT EXIST IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. BUT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE. A YEAR LOST AS WE TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS. AND SO I WOULD- I WOULD URGE US TO GIVE HIM THAT ROOM TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER PAN. THANK YOU- SENATE FORTINO- FOR- DRESSING THIS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND- I THINK I ALSO WOULD HAVE TO THE WORDS OF SAN PLEASURE- THANK YOU KNOW IS IT IS THIS THE RIGHT SOLUTION- I THINK YOU'RE WORKING WITH- YOU KNOW FOLKS BOTH IN SCHOOL AND WE HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS IT'S A IT'S A DIFFICULT PATH- BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- OF COURSE CERTAINLY WE ARE- WE REMEMBER. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. THEN HARMED- AND THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAPPENED. I MYSELF AS A PEDIATRICIAN HAS TAKEN. NOT TAKING CARE OF A CHILD WHO WILL ACTUALLY COMPETE- WELL TEMPTED SUICIDE WITH A GUN AT SCHOOL. AT ANNOUNCED IT UP PRIOR TO DOING IT AND- NO ONE TOOK HIM SERIOUSLY. SO- AND UNFORTUNATELY WASN'T QUITE SUCCESSFUL AT TWENTY AND IT UP HAVING TO TAKE CARE HIM- THE- IT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT. CERTAINLY THIS ISSUE IS SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR HAVING DRILLS. FROM MASS SHOOTINGS RIGHT TO EVEN MY OWN CHILDREN WHO ATTEND SCHOOL AND THAT HAS ACTUALLY AFFECT ON ALL CHILDREN RIGHT- WE'VE ACTUALLY IN THIS VERY COMMITTEE. FOR BILLS AROUND- YOU KNOW HER AT LEAST ONE BILL AROUND THIS ISSUE AND DON'T WANT TO CONCERNS WAS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM THAT ACTUALLY CAN CAUSE CHILDREN WHO HAVE TO GO THROUGH DRILLS WHERE ESSENTIALLY- THE EXPECTATION IS THAT SOMEONE'S. GOING TO SHOW UP IN THEIR SCHOOL AND HARM THEM WITH A GUN AND- THE IDEA THAT CHILD HAS TO PREPARE FOR THAT. POSSIBILITY IT IS THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SO- I THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE WANT TO EXPAND AND YOU'VE BEEN A CHAMPION OF EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND- RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE IN SCHOOL AND I KNOW MANY OF US HAVE- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO TRY TO GET. THE ROOT OF SOME OF THIS RIGHT SO WHAT IS CAUSING THE MENTAL HEALTH DISTRESS INTO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. THAT'S REALLY DOESN'T HELP WHEN YOU. HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE TO GO THROUGH DRILLS. AND FRANKLY FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY- SO- TO. IT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMEONE TO SHOW UP WITH A- WITH A WITH A GUN AND- CERTAINLY THERE ARE MANY WEAPONS BUT- GUNS ARE. PARTICULARLY DEADLY AND THE DESIGN TO BE SO. AND SO THAT IS A YELLOW RIBBONS- WE HAVE TO. CONFRONT THAT AS WELL- THE FACT THAT- IT'S ENOUGH OF A POSSIBILITY THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FEEL COMPELLED. TO ACTUALLY- PUT THEIR STUDENTS AND STAFF. THROUGH THESE DRILLS. THAT THAT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EVENT LIKE THAT HAPPENING IS SUFFICIET THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT. SO YOU KNOW I THINK I DO- AND I. THAT YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT- CERTAINLY HEAR YOUR COMMITMENT I KNOW YOU'VE SORT OF GIVEN BEFORE READING I GIVE IT AGAIN YOU'RE CLOSE TO CONTINUE WORK WITH THE- WITH THE I GUESS THE OPPOSITION AND ALSO. PEOPLE EARNESTLY POSE RIGHT NOW BUT ARE LOOKING FORWARD. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS OF THIS AND YOU KNOW WHO'S WHO TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING WHICH DATA AND TRACKING AND SO FORTH. AND I'M SURE YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THIS- SO- BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE- WHICH GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THIS. AND CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS BY THE TIME HE SHOWS UP ON THE FLOOR AND ALL OF US WILL BE EXPECTED TO CAST ANOTHER VOTE ON THIS BILL AND- SEE TO WHAT RESOLUTION YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. BRING THIS BILL TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD WILL WHO WENT TO- TRY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT ALSO- YEAH. I UNDERSTAND THAT- THERE THERE MAY BE ISSUES THAT ALSO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IF WHEN I DO THIS CORRECTLY. SO CERTAINLY WITH THAT- I CERTAINLY GIVE YOU THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO AND- AND APPRECIATE- YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD- AND- LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON IT THANK YOU. THANK. YOU SENATOR PAN. CENTER CORTESE. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR- OF YOUR- ONE OF. THE FOR. TWO MINUTES BODY OF WORK THAT I'VE SEEN EVEN IN MY TIME HERE SHORT RELATIVELY SHORT TIME YEAR ROUND. OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- THAT'S NOT THIS BILL- THE END IF IT WAS THIS BILL THAT WAS THE APPROACH THAT WAS BEING TAKEN- YOU KNOW PERIPHERALS THROUGH WELLNESS CENTERS AND SCHOOLS THAT WERE WERE WORKING SO HARD TO FIND ESTABLISH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- I CERTAINLY WOULD APPROACH IT MUCH DIFFERENTLY MY- CONCERNS. WHICH ARE. VERY VERY DEEP AND- REALLY RUN TO THE COURT OF- OF. YOU KNOW MY IDEOLOGY ROAD CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. OF A PARTICULAR- I WOULD SAY THESE ARE THE ONLY AREAS OF CONCERN IF THEY WERE THE- THERE ARE OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN THAT I WOULD OTHERWISE PROBABLY BE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH THE AUTHOR IN. S. GOOD YOU KNOW- THERE'S A COUPLE COLLEAGUES OF THE PEOPLE WHO THE BILL ON BUT I CAN'T DO THAT WITH SECTIONS LIKE THIRTEEN A AND B. IN THE BILL. OF THOSE GOES SO FAR BEYOND- MY. CORE BELIEFS IN CIVIL LIBERTIES- THE I JUST CAN'T ASSOCIATE AND I VOTE WITH THOSE SECTIONS IN A I KNOW THERE'S BEEN WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS- A NOT A TYPICAL A NOT UNCOMMON SCRAMBLE THE LAST FEW DAYS TO TRY TO WORK OUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ON THE BILL BUT WE'RE STILL HERE TODAY WITHOUT THEM A DELETED OR WORKED OUT YOU KNOW AND IT'S NOT IT'S ALSO WILL BE ARMY WHO SEE THIS YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR TO SAY. YOU KNOW WILL TAKE UP TWO THIRDS OF- SECTION OF YOUR BILL LEAVE ONE THIRD LEFT LIKE THE EDUCATION ON. COMPONENT HERE IN THIRTEEN C. WHICH IS OUTSTANDING. YOU KNOW SOMETHING I COULD SUPPORT- BUT IT'S NOT UP TO ME TO SAY TO GOT TO THIRDS OF YOUR BILL AND LEAVE THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT WAS PRESENTED I THINK TO ME AS- YOU KNOW THAT THE DIRECTION IT WAS GOING. CONJUNCTION WITH THIS COMMITTEE OR THE NEXT COMMITTEE. OF IN TERMS OF SOME WRITTEN AMENDMENT SO- I'M SURE IS DISAPPOINTING AS I'M SURE- THAT SOUNDS TO. CENTER PORTANTINO TO YOU BOTH IN A WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS I KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF CONVERSATIONS LAST FEW DAYS. AGAIN I HOPE YOU RESPECT THE FACT THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN PRINCIPLES I JUST CAN'T CROSS- YOU KNOW. IN SLEEP AT NIGHT IN TERMS OF MY OWN SENSE OF CIVIL CIVIL LIBERTIES ON THE BILL- SO I'M GONNA SPEAK STAIN OFF TODAY. THANK YOU. THINKCENTRE CORTESE THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. US SENATOR PORTANTINO I TOO AM OPPOSING THE BILL I WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANY SCHOOLS OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. WHO WANT TO BE TASKED WITH COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM PARENTS ABOUT THE POSSESSION OF THE FIREARMS. I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE OPEN TO ADDRESSING CONCERNS FROM THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE BUT WE'RE VOTING ON THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY. I CANNOT SUPPORT A REQUIREMENT THAT SCHOOLS INTERJECT THEMSELVES INTO ISSUES. BEST LOVE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT. SCHOOLS ARE STRETCHED THIN ON ON MANDATE FROM US HERE IN SACRAMENTO. SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ARE STRESSED OUT AND EXHAUSTED. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO HANG ON TO THE BEST THEY CAN FOR OUR STUDENTS AND THIS IS ONE MORE BURDEN. I CANNOT SUPPORT A REQUIREMENT THAT STUDENTS BE INVESTIGATED FOR DISOBEDIENCE OF SCHOOL RULES. WE HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE THAT OUR ZERO TOLERANCE APPROACH HAS PERPETRATED. MORE LONG FIRST FORSMAN AND LESS DISCRETION FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO KNOW THEIR STUDENTS BEST CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WILL BE HEARING A BILL LATER TODAY BY SENATOR BRADFORD THAT REMOVES MANY REQUIREMENTS FOR MANDATORY REPORTING TO LAW ENFORCEMET WHILE LEAVING THAT DISCRETION TO EACH SITUATION. WE ALL WANT TO ENSURE SCHOOLS ARE SAFE AND TO PREVENT HORRIFIC SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE. I BELIEVE A BETTER APPROACH IS BY ADDRESSING STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THAT FROM ALMOST ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY. YOU YOURSELF ARE CARRYING SEVERAL BILLS A MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW CRITICAL IT IS THAT WE HELP STUDENTS FAMILIES. AND SCHOOLS NAVIGATE TRAUMA AND HARDSHIPS. WE SHOULD PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE AND FUND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS STUDENTS UNDERLYING NEEDS. AND TO ENSURE SCHOOLS ARE SAFE WELCOMING AND INCLUSIVE FOR ALL STUDENTS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER I WILL BE VOTING NOW. MISTER PORTANTINO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE DO SO. I WOULD THINK THAT. THANK YOU FOR THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION- I RESPECTFULLY ASK TO SEE IF THE BILL COULD MOVE TODAY- AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER THE STAKEHOLDERS WE ARE WORKING IN GOOD FAITH TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS I BELIEVE WE'LL GET THERE I BELIEVE MUCH OF THE STATE'S SOFT OPPOSITION WILL BE RELIEVED- WHEN WE DO- TYPICALLY DURING THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE PRESENTED WITH AMENDMENTS TO CONSIDER AND WE CONSIDER WHETHER WE WANT TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS OR NOT I WAS HOPING TO HAVE THAT WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN DEALING INDIVIDUALLY WITH A LOT OF IT THE INSTITUTIONS- AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID- NO ONE WANTS TO READ ABOUT A TRAGEDY IN THE PAPER. NOBODY WANTS TO. READ AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THOSE FOLKS IN MICHIGAN OR THINKING ABOUT TODAY'S THINKING IF I WOULD HAVE COULD WE HAVE SAVED A LIFE. WELL YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU SAVE A LIFE. BUT YOU KNOW DEEP IN YOUR HEART THAT IF YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN. YOU WILL. AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. TO HAVE THIS BILL MOVE TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE SO WE CAN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS WHICH ARE LEGITIMATE. AND WE SAID ALL ALONG WE'RE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THEM- SO WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I DON'T. THINK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO. MEN CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE S. B. NINE ZERO SIX THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THAT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. LEYVA NO. LEYVA NO OTRO ABOVE. PARTISI NOT VOTING. KELLY KELLY NO GLAZER GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE CAN I CAN I BELIEVE THAT BILL ON CALL FOR OUR ONE MISSING MISSING MEMBER THANK. ALL RIGHT TO EVERYONE WATCHING WE NEED AN AUTHOR I AM LOOKING FOR SENATOR BAKER SKINNER LA MON JONES BRADFORD GLAZER DOLLY MISTER DOLLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL- YEAH I SAW YOU TO ISRAEL SORRY ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A CENTER GLAZER FIRST SENATE ALL JUST BECAUSE HE IS THE PERSON FILE ORDER. AND I FORGOT ABOUT- CENTER BACKER. LIEUTENANT THE LAST SECOND ALL RIGHT SENATOR BAKER WHEN YOU'RE READY WE WILL HEAR FIRST SB EIGHT SEVEN SIX AND THEN S. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MANAGER MEMBERS. LAST YEAR I AUTHORED SB SEVEN SIX SEVEN. TO CREATE THE DIGITAL EDUCATION EQUITY PROGRAM. WHICH THIS COMMITTEE PASSED IN A BIPARTISAN VOTE. INSPIRATIONS YOU AGAIN IN SB EIGHT SEVEN SIX IS EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE DIGITAL AGE. AND WHICH REALLY CENTRO THAT EDUCATORS HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MAKE USE OF THE BEST TECHNOLOGY WHEN POSSIBLE. AND THIS NEED IS NOT GOING AWAY AT WORK UNFORTUNATELY PASSAGE TOMB HOUSING CLASSROOMS FOR NOW BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE IT'S CRITICAL TO EDUCATORS BE EDUCATED. THEMSELVES IN THE BEST WAY TO USE TECHNOLOGY IN MANY SCHOOLS THEY LACK ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT INFORMATION PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONCERT WITH PLAN FOR EMPLOYMENT CURRENT AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT INSTRUCTION. WITH ACCORDING TO STATE AND REGIONAL FOCUS ON POLICY PROGRAMS AND FUNDING MANY DISTRICTS DO NOT HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES. UP TO SELECT ACCESS IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY QUESTIONS EFFECTIVELY AND PROVIDE STUDENTS ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES- FROM HOMES. SO THIS IS STEP TOWARD CLOSING DIVIDE IN OUR SCHOOLS THE BILL IS COSPONSORED BY VARIOUS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION.

IN GAUGING ITS INTERACTIVE IT CAN BE PERSONALIZED ACCORDING TO STUDENT INTERESTS AND ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR READING LEVEL AND THEIR LANGUAGE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT FEATURED KANSU. WE HAVE AND WE THANK YOU YOU HAVE GIVEN US MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR TECHNOLOGY AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL AND VERY APPRECIATIVE. BUT REMEMBER THAT TECHNOLOGY NEEDS A VERY COMPETENT TEACHERS TO MAXIMIZE ITS ABILITY TEACHERS ARE USING EVERYTHING YOU'VE GIVEN US BUT SOME TEACHERS ARE MUCH MORE ADEPT AT THIS THAN OTHERS AND THE RIVER IF THE ROAD IN THE CLASSROOM CAN THE CLASSROOM TEACHER USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO ITS MAXIMUM ABILITY. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT EVERY TEACHER HAS ACCESS TO THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THEY CAN DO JUST THAT. WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO REALLY USE ALL THE MONEY AND TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU SENT US TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN REALLY ACCELERATE OUR STUDENTS LEARNING MAKE THEM GAUGED IN THAT MAKE THEM EXCITED ABOUT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY CAN DO THAT.

IN NINETY IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ALONG WITH THE SUPPORT OF CONTROLLER. JOHN JOHN- THERE WAS AT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER EVERYBODY HAD EVER HAD IS COMPLYING WITH THAT WITH THAT LAW- THERE WAS SOME AMBIGUITY IN THE LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWED SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO NOT COMPLY. IN FACT. ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE ARE ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THAT LAW REQUIRES OF THEM AS IT DOES INVOLVE PUBLICATION SEES. SO THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS TO PROVIDE THAT CLARITY AND ELIMINATE THAT AMBIGUITY AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED TO DO THE SAME THING THAT ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO DO AND- PROVIDE THAT TRANSPARENCY ON. ON PAY DATA- YOU KNOW THAT LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN GARCIA HAPPENED BECAUSE- THERE WAS A SCANDAL IN THE CITY OF BELL WERE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT. THE CITY MANAGER HAD MANIPULATED THE SYSTEM TO OBTAIN A SALARY. OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND IT MORE RECENTLY SOME NEWS REPORTS IN LOS ANGELES- POINTED OUT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF A VERY SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT DOWN THERE WAS BEING PAID SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. A YEAR. SO THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO CLARIFY THAT REPORTING OBLIGATION TO ALLOW THAT TO RIFIC WEBSITE UNDER THE- LEADERSHIP OF THE CONTROLLER TO HAVE THAT ACCESS TO.

IN MANAGED CARE OF NO FOR THE LINES IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD THANK YOU MR MODERATOR. WE WILL NOW GO TO LEAD OPPOSITION WE HAVE TO FOLKS WHO ARE IN LEAD OR WILL BE THE LEAD OPPOSITION INDIRA MCDONALD AND NATALIE SIDERIS BOTH FROM THE- SORRY MISS- INDIRA IS WITH THE DEPUTY CONTROLLERS LEGISLATIVE OFFICE. AND MISS OF SEVERUS IS FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AS WELL WHO WHO'S GOING FIRST HI MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS INDIRA MCDONALD WITH THE OFFICE OF STATE CONTROLLER BETTY YEE WHILE THE CONTROLLER SUPPORTS THE INTENT OF SB NINE TWO FOUR. I AM HERE TO EXPRESS OUR OFFICES IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS- AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT COULD BE EASILY ADDRESS I'M NATALIE WILL BE HERE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS PERFECT. HOW WE UNDERSTAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO REPORT THE COMPENSATION DATA AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BILL MANDATES THE SAME INFORMATION BE SEPARATELY REPORTED TO THE SCO. UNDER THE FORMER CONTROLLERS DIRECTION K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS WERE ASKED TO VOLUNTARILY REPORT COMPENSATION COMPENSATION DATA TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER IN RESPONSE OUR OFFICE RECEIVED A FLOOD OF COMPLAINTS THAT THE DATA REPORTING METHOD AND FORMAT OUR OFFICE USES. FOR OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL DATA REPORTING IS UNREASONABLE FOR ALREADY OVERTAXED SCHOOLS. HAS IT WOULD ENTAIL A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THEIR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AT GREAT EXPENSE BY FORCING THEM TO REPORT THE SAME DATA THEY ALREADY REPORT TO CDP TO SCO THIS BILL WOULD TRIGGER A BALLOT COSTLY STATE MANDATES CLAIM. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS ALREADY THE RECIPIENT OF A LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS ANNUALLY IN A WORKABLE FORMAT THIS IS EVIDENT BY THE CURRENT CDT. COMPARED TO OUR OFFICES 23% REPORTING COMPLIANCE. FOR VOLUNTARY REPORTING PROGRAM. IN ADDITION KERN LOCKER CD WITH. MAC FOR ANY DATA REQUIRED BY THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. BECAUSE COMPENSATION DATA IS CURRENTLY REPORTED TO CDP AND USED TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATION UNDER CURRENT LAW TO CALCULATE STATEWIDE AVERAGE SALARIES FOR DISTRICT USED IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT CARD. INCURRING GOT IS POSTED ONLINE WE WOULD ASK THAT THE INCREASED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BE CONSISTENT AND ALIGNED WITH CURRENT CD REPORTING IN THIS FUNCTION NOT BE PLACED WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER. CREATING A DUPLICATIVE MANDATE WE SHARE THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIM AND TO KEEP THE STATE'S GOALS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU SAID THAT MS MCDONALD IS JUST HERE FOR. NATALIE SAID ALLEY YEAH IT'S WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPORTING PROGRAM AND SHALL BE AVAILABLE ALSO FOR ANY QUESTIONS PERFECT ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD WE WILL THEN GO TO ANYONE HERE IN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. WHO IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SEEING NONE MISTER MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE QUEUE UP ANYONE WHO IS IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE TWENTY FOUR. THANK MEDICARE AND WHAT AGAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK THEIR POSITION ON SB NINE TWENTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. IN ONE OF THE FEW MOMENTS OF MEDICARE NO ONE'S COMMITTED IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS SENATOR PAN. THIRTY THIRD A QUESTION I JUST TO CLARIFY- FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE- ARE EXCITED YET IS THE SAYS SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE SALARY DATA IS A READY REPORTED JUST TO DEPART EDUCATION- SO IT'S ACTUALLY READY THERE. ARE ARE SO THAT AT THE TIME I CLARIFY SAID THIS IS THE STATE ALREADY BEING COLLECTED BY SOME AGENCY IN THE STATE YET WE UNDERSTAND SO THERE UNDER CURRENT LAW- AT EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES BY DISTRICT AND THE LOWEST HIGHEST AND AVERAGE SALARIES PAID THERE IS DATA REPORTING NOW IT MAY BE THAT OFFICE INTENTION OR LEGISLATION CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THAT. AND SOMEWHAT AND SO WE WOULD JUST ASK THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT TO SEE WHAT DATA THEY CURRENTLY HAVE AN COULD BE ENHANCED TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS AS OPPOSED TO I DUPLICATIVE REPORTING OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY DON'T. THAT ACTUALLY REPORT YOU DID HE INDIVIDUAL SALARY THEN TO A SO I GUESS AND A QUESTION I GUESS THE AUTHORS AND STUFF- CERTAINLY I WAS VERY- I THINK LITTLE DISAGREEMENT THAT PARTICULARLY SENIOR YOU KNOW SUPERINTENDENTS PEOPLE IN SENIOR ROLES ETCETERA LIKE THE EXAMPLES YOU PRESENTED FOUR DOORS FRAUD AT CETERA. DO YOU SO IS THE INTENT THEN TO HAVE EVERY SINGLE DOWN TO THE JANITOR- THIS IS SALARY REPORTED- SO IT'S SEARCHABLE AND THEN ALSO IS THIS THE SCOPE OF THIS IS THIS JUST ONLY EMPLOYEES AT. PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR THAT ANY EMPLOYEES IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ARE FUNDED THROUGH PUBLIC DOLLARS LIKE CHARTER SCHOOLS. SO I JUST WANNA CLARIFY EXACTLY WHAT THE ONE IN THIS DATABASE AND HOW. AND THEN WHO WHO'S YOU KNOW WHO WHO WHO'S- THE BETTER THE SCOPE OF THIS ESPECIALLY WHEN YEAH IT'S- I UNDERSTAND THIS IS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PUBLIC SPENDING. THANK YOU. PLEASE RECEIVE THE CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR PAT- THE GOAL IT REMAINS THAT REGIONAL GOAL CENTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S BILL IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND THAT'S THAT. EXPENDITURE TAX DOLLARS- THE TRANSPARENT. AND THAT INCLUDES ALL THOSE WHO WORK IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IDON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE JANITORS BEING PAID BUT IT'S UP TO PUBLIC DOLLARS AND SO IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE SAME SEARCHABLE FORMAT THAT THAT BILL- REQUIRED. YEAH THERE ARE WE HAVE A SEARCH- SITUATION WITH PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS- CURRENTLY THERE'S A DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS- FOR. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS IN ITS THREE HIGHEST PAID INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED EVERY YEAR I'M NOT INTENDING TO GET IN THAT SPACE AND CHANGE THE- THE GUIDELINES THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED FOR THE SPECIAL CATEGORY OF PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT THEY DO DISCLOSE. AT SOME LEVEL ALREADY THAT ANSWER I THINK THE AND SINCE YOU KNOW YOU BRING THIS UP AT- I GUESS- YEAH I'M GOING TO PUT YOUR BILL TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY- I HOPE WE LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF. WE DO HAVE THIS DISCREPANCY BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO DECIDE TO CHOOSE PUBLIC SERVICE AND YOU KNOW WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE NOT JUST ABOUT BEING ELECTED OFFICIALS ALSO ABOUT SERVING AND GOVERNMENT RIGHT. AND AND THEN THERE'S DIFFERENT ROLES RIGHT AND CERTAINLY IF SOMEONE HAS RESPONSIBILITY OVER YOU KNOW THE- THE PUBLIC DOLLARS AND SO FORTH- AND- THE- WOULDN'T MEAN HAVE TRANSPARENCY SO WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT SELF DEALING. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- THEN THERE'S OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO PROBABLY NOT REALLY IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN THE QUESTION IS THAT. WHAT ARE WE REALLY SERVING AT THAT POINT TO RATE IF TO ACTUALLY. IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PEOPLE NEAR PACIFIC SALARIES RIGHT AND SO THEY'RE NOT THAT KIND OF ROLE. AND SO I REALIZE THIS IS PERHAPS A LITTLE LARGER THAN THE SCOPE OF WHAT THEY DID THAT BUT THIS BILL DOES ADDRESS THAT FOR FIRST FOR SCHOOL SO. AND AT MAYBE REVISITING SOME ISSUES- WITH- THE PRIOR. PRIOR LEGISLATION BUT- YEAH I JUST WANNA BE A LITTLE SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE THE FINANCIAL. INFORMATION IS. NOW. CONSIDERED PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL. AND THEN SAYING THE IF YOU. ARE SIDE TO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC SERVICE BUT NOT HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC DOLLARS DIRECTLY. THAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP THAT PRIVACY JUST FOR SERVING JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR SOMETHING. I THINK YEAH I DON'T DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM FROM WORKING THERE AND YOU ONE COULD ARGUE THAT MAYBE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM DOING SO- BUT- I DO I. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS- THAT PERHAPS WE CAN BE THOUGHT THROUGH- BUT AGAIN I DO YOU KNOW THE UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT WE NEED TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY TO WE CAN IDENTIFY. A FRAUD OR A PEOPLE ARE SELF DEALING AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO- SO DATS- I'VE- HOPEFULLY UP WE CAN HAVE SOME FURTHER DIALOGUES THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PANTS CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU A FIGURING THIS BILL FOR I THINK THERE IS- THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN AROUND AT LEAST- AT LOCAL LEVELS AND FOR. MYSELF FOR A LONG TIME I I'VE WITNESSED WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CITY OF BELL AND IT WAS. IT WAS TRANSPARENT IT WAS OF THE OPEN THE PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND THEY DID IT IN A WAY- BUT I BELIEVE WAS UNDERHANDED AND THEY'VE SPIKED THEIR RETIREMENTS OF AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OF THE SYSTEM WAS AVAILABLE SO I. I AM GONNA SUPPORT YOU WILL MOVE THE BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S AGOOD OPPORTUNITY BE TRANSPARENT AND LOOK. AT THE END OF THE DAY- THE FOR THE FOR CALIFORNIANS YOU TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR WHAT AND- AND SOME OF THOSE ARE VERY HIGH. THE PAID POSITIONS AND JUSTIFIABLY THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE THEY'RE RUNNING MAJOR. A. B. LIKE RUNNING A MAJOR CORPORATION IF YOU'RE A COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER AND L. A. COUNTY. YOU HAVE A HUGE PAYROLL AND YOU HAVE A HUGE. RESPONSIBILITY QUITE FRANKLY AND THAT TYPE OF TALENT NEEDS TO BE COMPENSATED IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN GET GOOD PEOPLE TO DO THEIR JOB SO I THINK IT'S MORE. ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE- THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE THAT YOU NEED.TO DO A GOOD JOB IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THOSE POSITIONS QUITE FRANKLY- AND SOME SOME PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC MAY THINK THAT THAT'S- TOO HIGH- BUT WE SHOULD HAVE THAT DEBATE WE SHOWED THAT. WE HAVE THAT OPENNESS IS TO SEE- WHAT THE JOB TITLE IS. AND WHAT IT PAYS AND SOME PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM ARE UNDERPAID. AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THOSE FOLKS WHO. HAVE MET THOSE CRITERIA CENTER UNDERPAID AS WELL- BECAUSE IN THE PRIVATE WORLD THEY CAN THEY WOULD BE. COMPENSATED EVEN MORE BUT THEY CHOOSE TO GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE- BECAUSE IT'S A PASSION AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S- OPPORTUNITY ON BOTH ENDS. OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO LOOK AT WHO PEOPLE WHO ARE NEED TO BE PAID MORE AND- ARE NOT CLASSIFIED IN THE RIGHT AREAS. AND ONES THAT ARE AT THE TOP WHERE THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO I'M- HI. GRATEFUL I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY ANYONE ELSE COMMENTS CONCERNS SEEING NONE. OF THE CENTER GLAZER I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- BUT I WOULD ASK THAT YOU WORK WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE BECAUSE I DO THINK THEY BROUGHT FORWARD SOME. VALID CONCERNS ALL AND I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THE CONSISTENT CUSTODIANS MAKING. BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE DISPARAGEMENT SOMEONE WHO SHOWS UP AND WORKS HARD EVERY DAY TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS. ARE RUNNING AND WORKING AND WHAT THEY'RE BEING PAID COMPARED TO THE TOP PERSON. SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR A COUPLE THINGS TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AT FIRST I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ON THESE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES. IT'S FRUSTRATING WHEN THE BUREAUCRACY KIND OF GETS IN THE WAY OF- ARE GOOD DEL LAWMAKING THAT PREVIOUS LEGISLATURES HAVE ADVANCED- SECONDLY YOU KNOW- WE HAVE INCREDIBLE PUBLIC SERVANTS IN OUR STATE. AT EVERY LEVEL. IT'S ALWAYS TERRIBLE WHEN YOU HAVE THESE BY. APPLES THAT. THAT APPEAR. AND IT MAKES US ALL REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE- A PART OF A- TRUST IN GOVERNMENT IS- TRANSPARENCY AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING OUR WORK. APPROPRIATELY I WILL MENTION AND THIS IS AGAIN THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE. BUT A JANITOR. IN A PUBLICATION C. WAS MAKING OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A FEW YEARS AGO. AND THAT EXPOSED AT SOME ISSUES IN THAT PARTICULAR CLASSIFICATION FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THE AND THE SUPER HISTORIAL RANKS THAT THEY ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN IT'S VERY RARE IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. BUT A WELL WE TALK ABOUT THE TOP OF THE CHAIN AND THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S WHERE GREATER ABUSE OCCURS. I WOULD SAY THAT YOU NEVER KNOW AND SO WE ALWAYS LIKE TO TRY TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF THE B. AND REALLY TRANSPARENT CROSS THE BOARD. WITH THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY ASKED FOR I DON'T THINK IT'S CENTER GLAZER THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR DOLLY MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I HAVE US SOME WITNESSES FILING INTO THE ROOM RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE MAKING IT- SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE ESTABLISHES A PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE CARDIAC SCREENING PROGRAM. FOR USE GRADES FIVE TO TWELVE. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD ALONG THE LINES OF AN OTHERWISE HEALTHY KID DROPPING DEAD ON A BASKETBALL COURT. THOSE KIDS NORMALLY ARE FOUND TO HAVE SUFFERED FROM SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH. DUE TO NINE DIAGNOSED HEART CONDITION. MEANING IT WAS LIKELY PREVENTABLE. THE PILOT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED UNDER THIS BILL WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF CARDIAC SCREENINGS DONE BY NONPROFITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE RESULTING IN MORE CHILDREN BEING DIAGNOSED EARLIER. AND MAKING POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SEEK TREATMENT. THESE SCREENINGS OFFER EACH STUDENT THAT CHOOSES TO PARTICIPATE A CARDIAC RISK ASSESSMENT OF WARNING SIGNS IN FAMILY HISTORY IN A TWELVE LEAD. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM IMPORTANTLY FOUND TO HAVE HEART CONDITIONS PASSER ASSESSMENT WITHOUT ANY CONCERNS BUT THEY WERE FOUND TO HAVE IRREGULAR ECGS. THAT'S SO MANY LIVES CAN BE SAVED BY QUICK NON INVASIVE ECG. BEFORE I TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE CMA TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THE APPROPRIATE PHYSICIAN IS INTERPRETING ECG RESULTS.

BASED IN SAN DIEGO HERE IN SUPPORT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU MADE IT JUST IN TIME. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE NO LEAD OPPOSITION. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO OPPOSE THE BILL. SEEING NONE MISTER MODERATOR CAN YOU GO TO THE PHONE LINES. AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO OPPOSE SB ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE. CERTAINLY IN THE- LEADING HIM IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AND MEDICARE NO LINES IN OPPOSITION AT THE TIME THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BUT BEFORE I GO TO THE COMMITTEE SERVER JONES DID YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. I AT OTHER MINUTES READY FROM THE COMMITTEE YES YES WE ARE. ACCEPTING THOSE CAN PERFECT WASN'T SURE THEY WERE READY FOR TODAY OR FOR THE NEXT DAY ALREADY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CENTER PAN. THANK YOU AND THE ADDRESS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- WHAT QUESTIONS I DID HAVE THOUGH AND- GIVEN YOUR INTRODUCTORY TESTIMONY IS THAT- THE- IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BEEN HAVING SOME CONVERSATIONS CMA- BUT ALSO FOR EXAMPLE THE AMERICAN CAPPY AFFECTS HAS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT- WE ACTUALLY- COFFER HARD SCREEN OF ALL USE- ACTUALLY AT LEAST- YOU KNOW EVERY THREE YEARS. SO THAT'S CERTAINLY IN SUPPORT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT- ALSO THAT- THE GUIDELINES ALSO INDICATE THAT ROUTINE E. ECG SCREENING OF HEALTHY PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH NO PERSONAL FAMILY HISTORIES ARAMBULA READ OFF THE GUIDELINES HERE. KOREA BECAUSE HE SAID DEMONSTRATED A HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RATE HAS NOT BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE MORTALITY FROM SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH. SO THE- THE WEEK SO WE CERTAINLY SIX SCREEN AND THAT INVOLVES TAKING IT HAS. VERY CAREFUL HISTORY AND SO FORTH BUT A ROUTINE EKG SCREENING OF OTHERWISE SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY. PERSONAL OR FAMILY HISTORY IS NOT INDICATED BECAUSE THAT. WOULD ACTUALLY- THAT DOES ACTUALLY END UP POTENTIALLY EVEN CAUSING HARM BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF WORK UP AND SO FORTH AND CERTAINLY EXPENSES WELL. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT IN TERMS OF YOUR BILL AGAINST SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT WE DO SCREENING. IS THAT- THAT- THAT THE SCREEN IS CONSISTENT WITH- BASICALLY YEAH- MEDICAL GUIDELINES. SO THAT WE'RE NOT TELLING PEOPLE THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BE YOU KNOW SCREEN OUT. EKG THESE ARE G. ON BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. RIGHT AND I THINK DOCTOR PAN THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE WITH CMA RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT'S ALL AND- INCLUDED IN THE LANGUAGE AND- MAKING SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR. OKAY NIGHT BRIEFLY THAT- CENTER JONES AND IF THEY THINK IT'S YOU KNOW AGAIN I KNOW YOUR INTENT IS TO BE SURE WE HELP THE FAMILIES AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS AND- TESTIMONY I HEAR ON YOUR BILL. AND WE WANT TO TRY PREVENT US ON CARDIAC DEATH. AND SO WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DO THAT- BUT SOMETIMES WE SAY EVERYTHING WE CAN- THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN.

OF IT WHAT IS THE INTENT IN TERMS OF GETTING YOU KNOW GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY OR OR JUST DISTRIBUTION OF THE I KNOW YOU CAN'T CONTROL WITH THE GRANT APPLICATIONS COME FROM PER SE- IN THE SECOND PART OF THAT. BUT OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO. HAVE AN INTEREST WITH SOMEBODY THAT HAS ALMOST THIRTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE ARE READY SET GO ABLE TO COMPETE- AND SECONDLY- WE RUN INTO SOME ISSUES IN MY DISTRICT PARTICULARLY WITH ONE OF THE- VERY LOW INCOME DISTRICTS- HAVING A HARD TIME EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE. TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT TWELVE CAMPUSES AND THEY HAVE DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW BUT IN PASSED IN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OTHER NON TO IMMERSION PROGRAMS. COMPETING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE. OF A CHARTER SCHOOL ONE SINGLE SCHOOL. HAS THE SAME APPLICATION APPLICATION WAIT AS ALL THE SCHOOLS AS A AS A DISTRICT THAT HAS A DOZEN SCHOOLS IN IT THAT IS NOT AN ANTI CHARTER COMMENT THAT IS- AND IN EQUITY. IN COREY- AND I DON'T PUT THAT ON YOU BECAUSE THE L. E. A. DEFINITION IS USED SO OFTEN WE'VE SEEN IT ON OTHER BILLS EVEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE BILL EVEN TODAY. BUT I'M JUST WARNING WITH THIS PROGRAM. YOU KNOW WHAT. THOUGHT YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF. TRYING TO DISTRIBUTE. YES I DEFINITELY CAN COMMENT ON THE INTENT AND IF- FOLKS WITH WITH A YOU KNOW OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MIGHT BE ABLE TO THINK MORE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE HIS. DIVISION AND DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD- ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTE THESE FUNDS BUT- YOU KNOW THE INTENT IS DEFINITELY THAT THIS IS. A DIVERSE. SET OF SCHOOLS THAT WOULD GET A IT'S A SMALL PROGRAM RELATIVELY SPEAKING WITH THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE HAVE IN THE STATE AND THIS IS A VERY POPULAR. AT CURRICULUM AT THE MOMENT WITH A LOT OF WEIGHT LIST SO A SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IF YOU LIKE TO MAYBE COMMENT ON THAT LITTLE BIT MORE THAT IS READY- INTO THE CHAIR THE ABSOLUTELY- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION FOR THESE WOULD BE- GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. AND AND AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THIS IS A GRANT OPPORTUNITY THAT. DISTRICTS WOULD APPLY FOR. ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL CAN APPLY FOR ANY EXISTING PUBLIC SCHOOL CAN APPLY FOR. A TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL OR CHARTER PUBLIC SCHOOL- CAN APPLY FOR THESE GRANT DOLLARS AND THAT'S HOW- THE VIA A RUBRIC IN THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED- THE- ALREADY THE BILL SPELLS OUT THAT. SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ABOUT THE PRIORITY AREAS IN THE BILL. THERE ARE A FEW CRITERIA ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT WOULD GO INTO THE GRANT PROGRAM. BUT THERE BE A FULL GROUP OF FOR MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT- THE APPLICANTS TO BE SELECTED. GREAT I APPRECIATE ENSURING THAT WE JUST.

SB ELEVEN FORTY ONE EXPANDS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR IN STATE TUITION IN CALIFORNIA. AB FIVE FORTY PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND WENT TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS TO ACCESS HIGHER EDUCATION. UNDER EXISTING LAW A STUDENT MUST EITHER ATTEND CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL FOR THREE YEARS AND GRADUATE. OR ATTEND A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THREE YEARS AND EARN AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE. TO BE ELIGIBLE TO TRANSFER TO A UC OR CSU. IF A STUDENT STARTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL THERE IS A TWO YEAR CAP ON FULL TIME ENROLLMENT IN CREDIT COURSES. THAT SUPPLIED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AS A RESULT STUDENTS MUST TAKE A THIRTY YEAR OF NON CREDIT COURSES TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR AB FIVE FORTY STATUS. THIS CAUSES STUDENTS TO TAKE COURSES THAT THEY MEET THAT MAY NOT BE APPLYING TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. AND THE LASER TIMELINE TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO EARN AB FIVE FORTY STATUS. SB ELEVEN FORTY ONE EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION BY REMOVING THIS CAP. THE REST. TO FIVE FOR EIGHTY FIVE FORTY. FROM THREE TO TWO YEARS. PRIOR TO BEING ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE I'VE WORKED WITH MANY STUDENTS THAT BENEFITTED FROM EIGHTY FIVE FORTY. THIS BILL WILL FURTHER STUDENTS COLLEGE ATTAINMENT AND WILL INCREASE COLLEGE COMPLETION RATES. EVERY STUDENT DESERVES ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS.

AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED SB ELEVEN FORTY ONE IS A BILL WHICH WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION CALIFORNIA. BY BREAKING DOWN SOME OF THESE BARRIERS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN MANY OTHER STUDENTS IT'S NOT BEEN A LITTLE OVER TWENTY YEARS SINCE CALIFORNIA CRACKED OPEN THE DOOR TO HIGHER EDUCATION WITH ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE FORTY. THAT WAS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- TELLING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIA YOU BELONG IN HIGHER EDUCATION YOU BELONG HERE YOU DESERVE A CHANCE TO FURTHER YOUR GOALS AND SEEK A HIGHER EDUCATION AND CONTRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BY- INCREASING YOUR CHANCES OF EMPLOYMENT BY EARNING A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE.

THE ACT IN-COURT TODAY YEAH THANK YOU. AND MEDICARE- NO FOR THE BLIND IN OPPOSITION AT THE TIME THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS SENATOR DOLLY. WITH THE MANAGER SO I- FIVE THE ED IS SB I THINK BY FORTY THAT CREATED THE ORIGINAL SO I MY QUESTION IS THAT. THERE'S A THERE'S A FINITE AMOUNT OF CAL GRANTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THE PREVIOUSLY JIM. LEGISLATION ALLOWED FOR- WE CALL DREAMERS THAT WERE IN THE PIPELINE COMING TO BE ABLE TO GO ON AND MAKE AN EXCESSIVE CAL pTHE CAL GRANT HAS BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED IS NOT IT'S NOT. WE GET SIX BUT- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO GO AROUND SO WHAT WHAT HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION INTERACTING THAT AND ALLEVIATE THAT SAME PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY REDUCING THE- CRITERIA OF. OF TIME YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE- IN THE SCHOOL TO. BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE CALGARY REYES SO THE IDEA IS THAT THIS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO COULD QUALIFY- AND FOR THE CAL GRANT- THERE ARE STILL CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS AND THAT'S BEEN OVER SUBSCRIBED AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WILL CHANGE IT. WILL THIS CREATE MORE OF AN OVER SUBSCRIPTION I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT WE DECIDE TO DO WITH THE GAL GRANT I KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN MULTIPLE EFFORTS INCLUDING CURRENTLY. ON REVAMPING THE CAL GRANT- AND SO I'M GUESSING YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THAT THAT THOSE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS IN CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN BUT THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS THE CAL GRANT PIECE THAT THE SEPARATE PIECE. AND I KNOW THERE ARE MEMBERS. WHO HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONING THAT AND I SUSPECT YOU WILL SEE THAT BILL. THAT COME FORWARD- IN ITS TYPE OF CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS YES SENATOR PAM MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE CEREMONY WHICH I TO CLOSE THANK YOU AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED WITH THAT THOUSANDS. OF STUDENTS- AND MANY WHO WERE YEAH AND DOCUMENTED IN CALIFORNIA I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS MEANS. FOR STUDENTS WHO GREW UP HERE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO SCHOOL HERE AND CONTRIBUTE. YOU HEARD PEOPLE WHO ARE DOCTORS. YOU KNOW WHO HAVE. COMPLETED THEIR THEIR DOCTORATE AND MASTER'S DEGREE UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES AND WHO STAY IN OUR COMMUNITY. AD SO THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLE INVESTMENT. AND WE ARE HOPING TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT- YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA YEAR OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE. NON CREDIT CLASSES. JUST TO GO TO A FOUR YEAR SCHOOL AND BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR THIS THIS IS ABOUT AND INVESTMENT- AND THE DATA HAS SHOWN. THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS STAY HERE- AND THEY REALLY DO BECOME AND THEY LOOK FOR OTHER PATHWAYS. AT TO BECOME. FULLY FULLY YOU KNOW MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL. YOU SENATE LIMÓN. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SEN PAN. CONSULTANT CALL THE ROLL. BY LAW. SHE'S ME FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX SB ELEVEN FORTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LEYVA I LEAVE I- CHAU ABOVE. OR TROUBLED AYE COURTESY.

WE ONLY PROVIDE 9% OF OUR KIDS THAT GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH A BUS RIDE. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY- I THINK WE ARE IN THE BOTTOM OF THOSE. MARKS THE LOWEST FIVE STATES IF NOT THE LOWEST STATE WITH IN TERMS OF PROVIDING- TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL NOW WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT- THE SURVEYS WE CALIFORNIA HAS A PRETTY HIGH ABSENTEEISM RATE FOR OUR- K. THROUGH THREE THIRD GRADE STUDENTS IN IN THE SURVEYS. OF WIRE THESE CHILDREN MISSING SCHOOL IT IS COME OUT AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR MANY OF THEM IT WAS LACK OF TRANSPORTATION. NOW WE KNOW THAT IF YOU MISS SCHOOL IN THAT CRITICAL TIME PERIOD THOSE EARLY GRADES YOU FALL BEHIND. IN SCHOOL. AND SO IF WE CAN PROVIDE ANSWERED THAT ONE QUESTION BY PROVIDING SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION THEN WE'VE ADDRESSED A VERY IMPORTANT SCHOOL SUCCESS ISSUE. NOW IT WAS AFTER PROP THIRTEEN THAT CALIFORNIA REALLY REDUCE THE FUNDING TO SCHOOLS REGARDING TRANSPORTATION WHICH WE AT THAT POINT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE IS SOME LOGIC BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY STAYED IN THE CLASSROOM BUT WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION NOW WE'RE IN A HEALTHIER BUDGET SITUATION. AND THE WAY THE BILL IS CONSTRUCTED IT WOULD ALLOW FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO UTILIZE PUBLIC TRANSIT PUBLIC TRANSIT IF IT IS AVAILABLE IN THAT AREA OR TO UTILIZE- CONTRACT SERVICES WITH OF COURSE A PROPERLY QUALIFIED DRIVERS SO THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY. AND I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES WHO WERE BRIEFED AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION SO THAT- WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT- PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS A FREE BUS RIDES BY TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT AND THAT THE BROUGHT THE SMARTEST OF THAT IS A TECHNOLOGIST THAT. THERE'S A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT COULD- MAKE THIS DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT RIGHT AWAY WHETHER IT'S THE SUPPLY SHORTAGE AROUND- SCHOOL BUS AVAILABILITY OR- DRIVER SHORTAGES ARE VERY THINGS LIKE THAT SO OF COURSE WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THIS WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR SCHOOLS. ON THE OTHER AMENDMENT IS TO- AT THE SAME TIME THAT WILL DELAY THE REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION WE WOULD NOT PREVENT ANY OF THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE ABLE AND READY TO PROVIDE THIS TRANSPORTATION NOW. TO DO IT SO AND THEN LASTLY TO REPLACE THE PROPOSED FUNDING FORMULAS. WITH THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD BE REIMBURSED A TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND THE COSTS RAMPING UP. TO THE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT UNIVERSAL OUT UNIVERSAL OFFERING POLICIES ALL RIGHT TO LET ME JUST MOVED TO MY WITNESSES. I'VE GOT BETH MEYERHOFF OF THE CALIFORNIA PTA SHE'S GOING TO BE JOINING US BY TELEPHONE IN MATTHEW THOMAS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS WITH HERE IN PERSON. VERY GOOD THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER LET'S START WITH YOUR IN PERSON SUPPORT MR MATTHEW THOMAS. PLEASE FOR C. WHEN YOU'RE READY OF TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING I MATTHEW THOMAS I'M THE DIRECTOR TRANSPORTATION FOR GARDEN GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS BETTER KNOWN AS CASTRO OUR ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. CASTOR WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT TO PROMOTE SAFE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION FOR ALL CALIFORNIA PUPILS. WE ARE DEDICATED TO THE SAFETY OF ALL CHILDREN THROUGHOUT EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND EVERY AVENUE OF TRANSPORTATION SCHOOL BUSES ARE THE SAFEST FORM OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE NATION. CASTOR WAS RECOGNIZED BY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AS THE LEADER OF SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS ORGANIZATIONS STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. EIGHT SEVEN EIGHT. THE REASON IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA RANKS DEAD LAST IN THE UNITED STATES IN NEARLY EVERY METRIC. WE ARE THE SAFEST STATE WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO SCHOOL. THIS WOULD ALSO REDUCE SCHOOL SITE TRAFFIC AND SAVE. FUEL AND EMISSIONS. AS SENATOR SKINNER NOTED ONLY 9% OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL KIDS TAKE A SCHOOL BUS. TO SCHOOL EACH DAY THAT'S THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE IN THE NATION THE NATION AVERAGE IS ABOUT THIRTY SIX PERCENT. CALIFORNIA ALSO SPENDS THE LEAST AMOUNT PER STUDENT ON SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION OF ANY STATE SB EIGHT SB EIGHT SEVEN EIGHT WELL ALIGNED CALIFORNIA WITH OTHER STATES ON HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION. IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE STUDENT SAFETY WHICH IS THE MAIN MISSION OF OUR ORGANIZATION ACCORDING TO FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ABOUT 14% OF CARTS SHIPS DURING MORNING RUSH HOURS. ARE FOR SCHOOL RELATED TRAVEL REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CARS TRAVELING TO AND FROM SCHOOLS EACH DAY WILL IMPROVE SAFETY FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHT SEVEN EIGHT AND I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER THOMAS WE WILL NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINES MR A MODERATOR IF YOU CAN QUEUE UP MS MEYERHOFF AND SHE HAS TWO MINUTES AS WELL. AND THEY'RE GOING TO OPEN. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BETH MEYER HOPPED NINE EDUCATION LEGISLATION ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA STATE PTA IS AN ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS WHOSEMISSION IS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE LIVES OF ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA STATE PTA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL EIGHT SEVEN EIGHT WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT PKT TWELFTH GRADE IS OFFERED A FREE BUS RIDE TO AND FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL EACH DAY. LAST OF GUARANTEED TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL WAS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR UNEXCUSED ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL ACCORDING TO A RECENT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REPORT. WE BELIEVE THAT SB EIGHT SEVEN ABLE GREATLY REDUCE ABSENTEEISM CHRONIC BSENTEEISM CORRELATES HIGHLY WITH LOWER STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND LOWER GRADUATION RATES. CALIFORNIA'S LEFT SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION PLACES UNDUE BURDENS ON FAMILIES ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO DROP OFF AND PICK UP THEIR STUDENT. DISTRICT PROVIDED TRANSPORTATION ELIMINATES THAT TRAVEL TIME FOR FAMILIES AS WELL AS HELP RESOLVE CONFLICTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES WHO SCHEDULES MAY NOT PERMIT GIVING STUDENTS A RIDE TO SCHOOL CURRENTLY CHARGE FAMILIES TO RIDE THE BUS. OR FAMILIES THAT PAY FOR PUBLIC TRANSLATE TO TRANSPORT THEIR STUDENTS TO SCHOOL. IN SOME AREAS THE COST IS AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS PER MONTH PER STUDENT THAT IS SIMPLY UNAFFORDABLE FOR FAMILIES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL HELP HIS BREAK FROM THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO INCREASING STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN GRADUATION RATES. IT WILL BE GUARANTEED A WAY TO GET TO SCHOOL DAY AND FAMILIES WON'T HAVE TO DRIVE HOURS A DAY OR HAVE TO PAY ON AFFORDABLE FEES FOR BUS TRANSPORTATION. SB EIGHT SEVEN EIGHT WILL IMPROVE THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS PRESENTABLE EIGHT SEVEN EIGHT.

THE ACT ERROR ERROR RESOURCE BOARD PASSED THE TRUCK AND BUS RULE WHICH- TO IMPLEMENT EVEN THOSE REGULATIONS AND MANDATE THOSE OUT EVEN FOR FIVE YEARS IS GONNA BE REALLY COSTLY- TO SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO MEET THE STANDARDS THAT CALIFORNIA SETS THE BAR REALLY HIGH FOR SO I'M GONNA. I'M GONNA HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THERE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S- REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE DO GET TO OUR OUR OUR CHILDREN SAFELY TO SCHOOL BUT- HOW WE'RE GONNA GET OUR TO DO IT IS I THINK THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAIL SO I'M ONLY OFF YOUR BILL TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THE AMENDMENTS AND MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER DALITS CENTER CORTESE. HELLO THANK YOU THE AUTHOR OF FOR. DOING THIS WORK AND I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE- THAT IS INFORMED BY NINETEEN PASSED BUS TRIPS TO SACRAMENTO ON EDUCATION THE- I USED TO CONDUCT AS LOCAL OFFICIALS WERE TRYING TO CONTINUE THAT NOW- IN MY IN MY APRIL HERE'S A STATE SENATOR BUT ON VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE TRIPS- WERE STUDENTS WERE PRESENT HE TESTIFIED- AS TO THIS NEED. NOT SO MUCH FOR THEMSELVES ANYMORE BUT WAS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT WERE COMING UP- HEARD THROUGH THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN TYPICALLY THE TESTIMONY MOVED HERE IS I DO NOT WANT MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH- IN TERMS OF LACK OF TRANSPORTATION- JUST AS FAR AS FEEDBACK- WHICH YOU MAY OR MAY NOT- EMBRACE. OF FOR THOSE DISTRICTS SAID UP TO SOLVE OPERATE- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS CAN BE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED IN IN IN CERTAIN PARTS OF MY DISTRICT THAT WOULD BE REALLY CONDUCIVE TO STUDENT SAFETY- WHERE WE HAVE. EVERYTHING FROM RIVAL GREAT GANGS TO JUST PARTS OF OUR CITY THE UNFORTUNATELY OUR WALKABLE- ENOUGH IN IN UNIL HALF A MILE IS OFTEN. USED IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AS A- THE A FAIR DOES- WE TRY TO USE- EIGHT HUNDRED FEET- MORE LIKE A QUARTER MILE EIGHT HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED FEET- OFTENTIMES AS CRITERIA. YOU KNOW IN OUR OWN AREA ESPECIALLY MOST DIFFICULT- PUBLIC SAFETY AREAS SO JUST WANTED TO OFFER THAT SUGGESTION- IF. HE PUT SOME POINT OF THAT MIGHT BE EMBRACE WITH THAT- I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL- THINKCENTRE CORTESE ANYONE ELSE VENTURE MEN BUDGET CHARM SO USED TO CALLING YOU SENATOR SKINNER SAME THING OF THE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT I'M HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH ME AND WITH MY COMMITTEE STAFF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE OUTLINED ON PAGES SEVEN AND EIGHT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS PRESERVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT ALL PUPILS BE OFFERED FREE HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION WHILE COMPLICATING THE FOLLOWING. GIVE ELEAZAR TIME TO RAMP UP THEIR TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS BY DELAYING AND DELAYING THE DIRECTIVE FOR ELEAZAR TO OFFER UNIVERSAL TRANSPORTATION FOR FIVE YEARS CHANGE THE PROPOSED FUNDING METHODOLOGIES SUCH THAT ELLIE IS WOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR A 100% OF THEIR APPROVED TRANSPORTATION COSTS WITH AN ANNUAL COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT CLARIFIED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN REQUIRED BY ELEAZAR MUST BE PRESENTED PUBLICLY WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN PERSON AND VIRTUALLY THE GOAL OF THESE AMENDMENTS IS TO HELP SET ELOISE UP FOR SUCCESS. BY GIVING THEM ADEQUATE TIME TO PURCHASE BUSES HIRE QUALIFIED DRIVERS DESIGN OPTIMAL BUS ROUTES AND MUCH MORE THAT WE PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW FURTHER I BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ENSURE THE FUNDING PROVIDED TO CARRY OUT THIS REQUIREMENT IS STABLE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE REGIONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES AMONG THE OVER ONE THOUSAND ELOISE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE A CO AUTHOR I THINK THIS IS A LONG OVERDUE ISSUE. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU M. YES YOUR ESSAY INDICATED IN ACCEPTING THE MINIATURE COMMITTEE SPEND REALLY YOU ENTER COMMITTEE AND DO NOT WANT TO IN IN NOT IMPLICATE THAT YOU AS THE LEADER OF THE COMPETITOR OF ACTUALLY BEEN PIVOTAL TO THIS AND- THE DIEM IN MATH ARE AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE BILL- I WANTED TO. SEE WILL POINTS THAT ON SOME OF THE FOLKS SPOKE ABOUT I DIDN'T SO MUCH BRING UP BUT THE THOSE PARENTS OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO CAN DRIVE THEIR KIDS. TO SCHOOL WHEN THEY DO AND THERE'S NO OTHER TRANSPORTATION THEY CREATE A LOT OF CONGESTION NEAR THE SCHOOL SITE. AND THEN YOU HAVE OTHER KIDS WALKING AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A HIGH PEDESTRIAN DEATHS PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENT RATE AROUND SCHOOLS. AND SO IF WE CAN JUST REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CARS COMING INTO A SCHOOL EVERY DAY THAT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP- AND- ON- YOU KNOW WHETHER AIR QUALITY OR DISPOSSESSED AND SAFETY YOU NAME IT. AND THEN TO SENATOR CORTESE'S POINT. YES A HALF A MILE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE LITTLE LITTLE KIDS THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S THE DISTANCE SO WE YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE THE ABILITY TO MODIFY. SAY FOR THE LOWER GRADES OR YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE TO SEE AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH. THOUGH CERTAINLY YOUR POINT ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THE OLDER GRADES IS ALSO TRUE THOUGH IT MAY BE HARDER. TO REQUIRE- THE TRANSPORT FOR THE SHORTER DISTANCES SAY IN HIGHER GRADES BUT ANYWAY WE ARE DEFINITELY WE WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I THINK YOU BROUGHT UP SOME VALID POINTS. SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR BILL THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER THE BILL WAS MOVED BY CENTER CORTESE MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR S.

REQUIRES THAT SEXUAL EDUCATION MATERIALS BE POSTED ONLINE FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THEM GIVEN THE CURRENT DISTANCE LEARNING EDUCATION SYSTEM PARENTS OFTEN TIMES CANNOT PHYSICALLY VISIT THE SCHOOL ACQUIRED MATERIALS THAT WILL BE TAUGHT TO THEIR CHILDREN. THE SHIFT IN INTERNET BASED DISTANCE LEARNING HAS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOLS TO GET PARENTS MORE ENGAGED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. AND THIS BILL HELPS FOR THAT GOAL. ALL WE'RE DOING IS ENSURING THAT PARENTS CAN BE ENGAGED AT THE LEVEL THEY CHOOSE THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS KATHLEEN TO MANY. DEMEANING CO. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CATHOLIC- CONFERENCE AND I ALSO HAVE LANCE CHRISTIANSEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICY CENTER HERE TODAY.

SO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT PROVIDES FOR COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL EDUCATION AND HIV PREVENTION EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS IN GRADES SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE. ALLOWS FOR SIMILAR EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS IN GRADES EARLIER THAN EIGHT THEN SEVENTH WITH AGE APPROPRIATE AND MEDICALLY ACCURATE INFORMATION. MYSELF I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD THIS JOINT COBIT EXPERIENCE WHERE IF YOU HAVE YOUNG ENOUGH KIDS WHO ARE IN SCHOOL SITTING MAYBE NEXT YEAR AT THE KITCHEN COUNTER IF YOU WERE WORKING AND THEY WERE DOING AT SCHOOL. WE HAD AN INSIDE VIEW INTO WHAT THEY WERE LEARNING IN THEIR CLASSROOMS I THINK IT'S BECOME MORE AND MORE APPARENT THAT PARENTS REALLY WANT TO BE A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. I LEARN THINGS WITH MY FOURTH GRADER AND HAD SOME REALLY GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT PARENTS WANT TO DO SO WITH IT. WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR TWO ZERO ASKING FOR PARENTS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE WHAT'S BEING TAUGHT FOR THEIR TRIP TO THEIR CHILDREN ESPECIALLY AROUND THESE VERY SPECIFIC. AND IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR CHILDREN AROUND THE DINNER TABLE SO THEY CAN BRING THEIR OWN NARRATIVE IN THEIR OWN FAMILY STORIES TO BEAR. AS THEY SHARE THEIR VALUES ABOUT THIS THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CALIFORNIA KIND OF COMFORT. IN STRENGTHENING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OUR PARENTS BY MARTIN. RECOGNIZING THE ROLE THAT PARENTS PLAY AND IN THE NATION. WE AFFIRM THE PARENTAL HUMAN RIGHT TO DIRECT AND TO BE FULLY ENGAGED IN THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. AND THEN CURRENT STATE LAW AT THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES SAYS THAT PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OF THE ALTERNATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPARTING VALUES REGARDING HUMAN SEXUALITY TO THEIR CHILDREN. THIS BILL AFFIRMS THAT RECOGNITION AND STREAMLINES THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTS TO ENGAGE IN INJURY. THE LEVINE AFTER THEIR CHILDREN. THANK AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AND TWELVE TWENTY TWO THANK YOU MISTER MAKER MISTER CHRISTIAN CHRISTIANSEN. THESE ARE GONNA BE WITH YOU AGAIN LANCE CHRISTIANSEN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF EDUCATION POLICY AND GOVERNANCE AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY POLICY CENTER AN ALUM OF THE SENATE. GOOD TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY.

REGRETTABLY OPPOSE- S. B. TWELVE TWENTY TWO HOWEVER WE DO APPRECIATE- THE AUTHORS- BUT WILLING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS FROM LAST YEAR'S BILL TO REMOVE THE IMPLEMENTATION. IMPEDIMENTS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE TRANSLATIONS THAT LAST YEAR'S BILL HAD HAD REQUIRED- THE BILL WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ELEAZAR TO OBTAIN MATERIALS FOR THE UNIT ON A SEXUAL HEALTH AND HIV PREVENTION EDUCATION. AND THE MORE DIFFICULT SERVE STUDENTS- INTEL TO DISTRICT STAFF CHARGED WITH MANAGING- THE CURRICULUM AND PARENT OUTREACH- WE'VE HEARD THAT- DISTRICTS HAVE FOUND THAT THE USE OF TRAINED STAFF. HAVE BEEN MOST EFFECTIVE IN ANSWERING THAT TEMPLE QUESTIONS THEY RECEIVE FROM PARENTS. THESE INTERACTIONS ALLEVIATE MOST OF THE CONCERNS THAT PARENTS HAVE WITH THE UNIT AND MATERIALS. I DISTRICTS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED- THAT PARENTS AND OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS SUCH AS STATE LEADERS AND COMMUNITY NONPROFITS FOR EXAMPLE ARE INVOLVED IN THE TOOL SELECTION. BEFORE THEY ARE USED IN THE CLASSROOM. I DISSENT- IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PARENTS TO INSPECT THE MATERIALS BEFORE THEY ARE ROLLED OUT FOR ACTUAL USE. ADDING A NEW REQUIREMENT- TO THESE MATERIALS IT MAKES. MATERIALS AVAILABLE AT SCHOOL SITES- BYPASSES THESE EXISTING OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND MAY MAKE IT HARDER FOR PARENTS TO- BE INVOLVED IN IN THE SELECTION PROCESS. AND HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD- SB TWELVE TWENTY TWO THREATENS TO DISRUPT THE CURRENT SELECTION AND ADOPTION PROCESS CURRICULUM MATERIALS USUALLY HAVE AN EIGHT TO TEN YEAR CYCLE- WHICH WOULD BE CUT SHORT AS MANY MATERIALS ARE NOT AVAILABLE EVEN AND- ELECTRONIC VERSIONS- THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE BILL. I LIKE MATH AND ENGLISH OF COURSE MATERIALS WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE AS MANY AS TWENTY FIVE- MORE. I TWENTY FIVE OR MORE DIFFERENT CHOICES OF COURSE MATERIALS THERE MIGHT ONLY BE THREE OR FEWER- OPTIONS FOR- FOR THESE- FOR THIS UNIT. THE BILL ALSO COMPLICATES COMPLIANCE WITH AUDITS AND MONITORING OF LEDS. BY REQUIRING EVERY SCHOOL SITE TO MAKE CURRICULUM TAX THAT'S TWO MINUTES IF YOU WRAP UP PLEASE SURE- SO I AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT- AND- I. WE APPRECIATE HIS EFFORTS TO KIND OF- MAKE THIS. A LITTLE EASIER FOR DISTRICTS TO IMPLEMENT BUT WE STILL HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE HERE IN ROOM TWENTY ONE HUNDRED PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE.

HERE WE HAVE A NO FURTHER WANTED TO THE OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND- WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT- THAT'S NOT STUDENTS DON'T GET AND TAKE ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT- UNNECESSARILY- I GUESS A COUPLE. OF A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO ONE IS THAT- NOW THAT I GUESS SURE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OF THESE PEOPLE TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION- SAID NO DATE DAY OBJECTED TO THE LACK OF REQUIREMENT TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT HOWEVER IS THERE ANYTHING YOUR BILL THAT PROHIBITS THE SCHOOL FROM IF THEY FELT THE ASSAULT WAS ACTUALLY OF. INTENTIONAL SERIOUS AND SO FORTH- ON SCHOOL PERSONNEL THAT THE THAT THEY COULDN'T CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TELL THEM WHAT I WONDER FOR SO LONG FOR SENATE. I'M SAD TO REPORT THIS ISSUE CONTINUED FALSE NARRATIVE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ANYTIME YOU WANT TO MAKE REFORMS ARE IMPROVEMENTS TO A SYSTEM. THE REQUIREMENTS STUDENT NOTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT STE THEY ARE STILL ABLE AT ANY TIME THAT A TEACHER ADMINISTRATOR FEELS THERE'S A- QUALIFY THREAT OR A STUDENT SHOWS UP. ON CAMPUS WITH A DEADLY WEAPON THERE ARE STILL REQUIRED TO REPORT IT SEEN THE UNNECESSARY REPORTS OF. A FIST FIGHT AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT WE'VE ALL SEEN AND BEEN INVOLVED IN FROM THE TIME WE ENTER KINDERGARTEN TO THE TIME WE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. AND THE FAR DIFFERENCE AGAIN IS HOW FREQUENT POLICE ARE CALLED WHEN YOU'RE A BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS VERSUS WHITE STUDENTS TO CONTINUE TO COME ON CAMPUS WITH GUNS AND ALL GO HOME IN A ONE CHANCE SO IT DOESN'T REACH- REMOVING MINISTERS. OR TEACHERS ABILITY TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IF WITH A QUOTE CREDIBLE THREAT IS THERE OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION AND THEN THIS IS THE SECOND QUESTION I DO HAVE IS THAT- RELATED TO THE PROVISION- THAT YOU'RE REMOVING THE PROVISION RELATES TO WILLFUL DISTURBANCE OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL OR PUBLIC SCHOOL MEETING. AND TO FIND ASSOCIATED- A CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND PERHAPS WHY THIS MAKES SENSE TO REMOVE FOR STUDENTS- I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT- SOMEONE WHO IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCHOOL SHOWS UP IN THE SCHOOL OR AN ADULT WHO HOPEFULLY IS- WOULD HOPEFULLY HAVE EXERCISE BETTER JUDGMENT- SO NOT A PUPIL AT THE SCHOOL STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL- BEFORE WE'VE SEEN CASES OF TEACHERS AND OTHER SCHOOL PERSONNEL BEING HARASSED OR SOMETIMES EVEN ASSAULTED ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW THEY ACTUALLY COMMITTED SALT. THE OTHER LOTS OF PRACTICE IN THE PLACE- IS THERE A REASON WHY WE WOULD JUST SIMPLY REMOVE THIS FOR STUDENTS AND STILL KEEP IT IN PLACE PERHAPS FOR OTHER PEOPLE GIVEN THE FACT UNFORTUNATELY THESE INCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED EVEN RECENTLY. I THAT'S AGOOD QUESTION AND OUR GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE SURE WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES WHERE STUDENTS WERE KNOCKING ON DOORS AND REPORTED AND- TURNED OVER T POLICE. YES IF SOMEONE ON THE RISE COMES ON CAMPUS WE WOULD HOPE THAT. NOT ONLY TEACHERS BUT ANY RESPONSIBLE ADULT WOULD DO THE NECESSARY- NOTIFICATION TO. IN THAT DISTURBANCE AND NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THIS WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW. WALK A FINE LINE IN MAKING SURE KIDS ARE NOT IN TANKER IN THIS REPORT. RIGHT WELL I I'LL I WOULD FOR IT IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD- I WOULD I WOULD PROBABLY HOPE THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER JUST MAKING EXCLUSION JUST FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED STUDENTS. GOD IT MAY BE IS TOOL UNFORTUNATELY HE NECESSARY POTENTIALLY NECESSARY. FOR THE ADULTS ARE ARE OR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SCHOOL COMING ONTO CAMPUS- DOING THAT AND THAT YOU'VE LOST IT GIVE SOMEONE A TOOL TO SAY THERE'S ACTUALLY A CONSEQUENCE FOR DOING THAT SO. BUT I'VE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR EXAMPLES WITH STUDENTS AND THAT NO WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- YOU KNOW. THE NEW YORK ALL RIGHT SISAL OKAY WELL THANK YOU SANDRA- AND AGAIN PRECIADO TO MY QUESTIONS AND THAT HELPING WITH THE BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME THINKING YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER PAM AND CONSULT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. GIVE ME. I'M SORRY CENTER BRADFORD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I DID IT YESTERDAY THANK GOD FOR GOOD COMMITTEE- YEAH EGGS. AUG AGAIN THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE ALL WE WANT TO DO IS REDUCE THE LEVEL OF POLICE INTERACTION WITH KIDS SO THEY CAN BE. FEEL COMFORTABLE NOT TRAUMATIZED AT SCHOOL- WE'VE SEEN A GREATER POLICE PRESENCE AND- ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE IT. FIRST AND FOREMOST THE KIDS ARE SAFE AND THEY'RE IN A PROPER LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BUT THEY'RE NOT FEARFUL THAT. A SIMPLE FISTFIGHT OR VERBAL ALTERCATION LEAD TO THEM BEING CITED OR ARRESTED AS WE SAW A FIVE YEAR OLD- EARLIER THIS YEAR IN HANDCUFFS A FIVE YEAR. OKAY BUT SO ANYWAY IT'S A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS ALL CONCERNS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD MAN CONSULT THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER PAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS THAT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE OTRO ABODE PHOTO ABOVE NO CORTESE BY PROTESTS THE AYE DALY. GLAZER MCGUIRE. HAM HI AM I. BELIEVE THAT ON CALL FOR OUR APPS MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD MANAGER MEMBERS ALL RIGHT WE'RE MOVING TO OUR FINAL BILL THE DAYS SENATOR CHOI BOGUE THE FLOOR IS YOURS THE- PLEASE PRESENT SB TWELVE EIGHTY NINE WHEN YOU ARE READY. WHERE EVERYONE AGO IT DOES MAKE IT STAY HERE. OKAY TIME TO LIVE. SO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWELVE EIGHTY NINE THANK YOU CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE MEASURE TITLE FIVE ENTITLED TWENTY TWO YOU HAVE THE EDUCATION CODE CREATED STANDARDIZED EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS IN OPERATING CLASSROOMS FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN THEY ALSO CREATED A REQUIREMENT FOR ALL TEACHERS TO EARN TWELVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION UNITS AT THE COLLEGIATE. LEVEL THESE REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER EXTEND PAST TEACHERS TO INCLUDE ANY INDIVIDUAL WORKING ON A PRESCHOOL CAMPUS. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CREDITS INCLUDE ACTIVITIES LIKE DIAGRAMMING YOUR FIRST PRESCHOOL CLASSROOM EIGHT AND VARIOUS OTHER PROJECTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PREPARING A TEACHER TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE A STANDARD PRESCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. WHILE THESE CLASSES PROVIDE A VERY SENSIBLE EDUCATION REQUIREMENT FIRST PRESCHOOL TEACHERS THEIR INCOME GREEN WITH THE PREPARATION NEEDS OF ADMINISTRATORS UP OUTSIDE RECREATION FOR OUR PROGRAMS. ALTIJD RECREATION PROGRAMS PARTNER WITH PRESCHOOLS TO BRING VARIOUS ACTIVITIES TO PRESCHOOLERS IN ADDITION TO THEIR TRADITIONAL PRESCHOOL PROGRAMMING. CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY RECOGNIZED THE HIRING AND STAFFING CHALLENGES THAT RESULTED FROM THE APPLICATION OF TEACHER CREDENTIALING STANDARDS TO THE POSITION OF PART TIME COACHES AND CREATED AN EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC RECREATION PROGRAMS. BUT DID NOT EXTEND THE EXCEPTION TO PRIVATE PROGRAMS. SB TWELVE EIGHTY NINE WILL SIMPLY EXPAND THE EXCEPTION FOR LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS AS SPECIFIED IN HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE FOR PUBLIC RECREATION PROGRAMS TO ALSO APPLY TO PRIVATE RECREATION PROGRAMS. THIS WILL CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT GREAT WORK GOING ON IN OUR SCHOOLS. I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT JOVAN BARCHI WITH SOCCER SHOT OC AND LEYVA JERUSALEM APPARENT AND FORMER TEACHER. TERRIFIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY BOTH ARE CALLING IN OF JOBIN BARKLEY YOU MAY START YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND THEN WILL WE WILL GO TO MISTER SALOUM. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MY NAME IS JASMINE BARKLEY I OWN A FAMILY RUN PRIVATE RECREATION PROGRAM ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE FACE I OUR BUSINESS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO GROW IMPACT FOR CHILDREN ESTIMATED TO THE ONGOING REQUIREMENT TO HIRE AN EMPLOYEE FULL THANK YOU FEATURING PRESCHOOL TEACHERS TO DO A PART TIME JOB COACHING SOCCER CLASS. THIS IS BEEN MADE EVEN MORE CHALLENGING BY THE CODE CRISIS AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE AVAILABLE FUTURE WORKFORCE. WE UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT INTENTIONS OF PETALS FIVE AND TWENTY TWO WHICH PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CHILDREN WILL STANDARDIZE THE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PRESCHOOL TEACHERS WHO CARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EDUCATING A COSTUME FOR CHILDREN. THIS STANDARDIZATION HELPS ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN ARE WE PREPARED FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NO. MATTER WHICH PRESCHOOL THAT TIME. WE BEGIN ASKING WHY AFTER TIME CO WORK FOR A PRIVATE. RECREATION PRO. WAS ONLY ON CAMPUS FOR THIRTY FIVE BEFORE MINUTES PER WEEK IS REQUIRED TO MEET THE STATE EDUCATION STANDARDS OF A FULL TIME PRESCHOOL TEACHER. WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR A NEW EXEMPTION TO BE CONSIDERED. THE STATE QUICKLY REALIZED BY CHALLENGING IT WAS TO STOP THEIR OWN RECOGNITION PROGRAMS WITH YOU SHOULD BE CERTIFIED PRESCHOOL TEACHERS. SO THE ST PATRICK'S MENTION FOR THEIR OWN PUBLIC RECREATION PROGRAM EMPLOYEES. WE'RE ASKING THE SUSPENSION THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN CONSIDERED APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RECREATION PROGRAMS INCLUDING EXTENDED TO COVER ALL RECREATION PROGRAMS. PROGRAM EMPLOYEES IN A WAY THAT WILL ALLOW ALL POSITIVELY IMPACT FOR CHILDREN. WITH THE STATED pTWENTY TWO BEING TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT HEALTH SAFETY OF CHILDREN. WE BELIEVE THAT EXPANDING EXEMPTION WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO PROGRAMS MORE CHILDREN IN A WAY THAT DELIVERS THE STATED GOALS OF THE TITLE. AFTER THE TO PRODUCE A STUDY THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PHYSICAL AND ACADEMIC BENEFITS OF ACTIVE LIFESTYLE A YOUNG EACH ADDITIONALLY. WHILE MANY PARENTS ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THE PHYSICAL BENEFIT HAVING YOUR KIDS PLAY SPORTS. A RECENT STUDY BY THE CLEVELAND CLINIC ALSO SHOWS THAT ENGAGING IN TEAM SPORTS TO ACTUALLY HELP KIDS WARD OFF. DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AS WELL. WHICH IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THIS POST AND DEMOCRATS. EXPANDING EXEMPTIONS-INCLUDE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RECREATION PROGRAMS WILL CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS INTENDED STATED DESIRE. APPELS FIVE TWENTY TWO WHICH ARE TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CHILDREN PHYSICALLY MENTALLY EMOTIONALLY AND ACADEMICALLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MS. LUXURY.

THAT BARRIER ENTRY FOR PROGRAMS I CAN BREAK GAP BETWEEN SCHOOL KIND. AND IDLE TIME FOR CHILDREN. ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON HOW YOUNG BRAINS DEVELOP. FOR EXAMPLE ACTIVITY CENTERED AROUND YOUR SIZE AND MOVEMENT CAN BE A MEANS OF SELF REGULATION IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL WORK. ATTENTION DEFICIT COOL AND CREATIVE EXPRESSION. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED BY PROGRAMS BEYOND ACADEMIC. WHEN THESE ARE ABSENT AS PART OF THE CORE CURRICULUM ENRICHMENT PROGRAM CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. CHILDREN ESPECIALLY CHILDREN OF COLOR LIKE MINE SHOULD BE PROVIDED THAT OPPORTUNITY AT SCHOOL. AS A PARENT I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT WHEN THERE ISN'T A PUBLIC ORGANIZATION WITH MANPOWER PROVIDER PROGRAM. THERE EXISTS A BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXISTING CAPACITY TO DO SO. YOU WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A PARENT WHO CARES. WHETHER THEIR PREQUEL RICHMOND PROGRAM AND PUBLIC OR PRIVATE. YOU JUST. HAVE A FEW GUIDELINES. THIS IS A MATTER OF MENTAL HEALTH AND VITAL IN OUR POST PANDEMIC WHY.

AND MEDICARE WE HAVE A NO BYNES'S OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND- CENTER SHOW VOTER APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH YOUR BILL I GUESS I COULD JUST FOR CLARIFICATION- SO. THOUSAND CHILD CARE RIGHT AND THE ONE INVOLVED YOU HEARD YOGA SPORTS HEALTH DR TARA WOULD THAT CHILD THEN BE LEFT IN THE CARE OF THAT COACH WHO ARE WITH THEIR ACTUALLY BE SOMEONE WHO SO IN OTHER WORDS THE TARGET PEOPLE HAVE TO GET LICENSE AND SO FORTH RIGHT GO THROUGH THE SCREEN WOULD THEY EVER BE LIVE WITH THOSE CHILDREN EVER BE LEFT WITH SOMEONE WHO ISN'T ON THEIR OWN OR IT SO I WASN'T SURE ABOUT THIS WAS THAT THE SITUATION OR IS THAT- WELL THEY WOULD HAVE SOMEONE WHO YOU KNOW WENT THROUGH ALL THE SCREENING AND SO FORTH. BUT WITHIN MY REQUIRE SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS THAT THE COACHING TO HAVE TO ACQUIRE IT IF THERE. ARE HUGE HE HAD SOMEONE WHO. WHAT THE RULES AND IS CERTIFIED AT ALSO PRESENTS NOTED AYE AYE THAR CLARIFIED THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOUNG CHILDREN WITH SOMEONE ALONE. WHO HASN'T BEEN GONE THROUGH THE SWINGING OUR QUALIFICATION WORK. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN SO THIS BILL IS DEFINITELY NOT INTENDED TO REMOVE ANY NON PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS- BUT YET NOT TO REMOVE SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN SO IT'S IT HAS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STOP THE BETWEEN SERVE FINGERPRINT IT STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS THE ONLY THING THAT THERE WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM IS TO HAVE THE EDUCATIONAL FORMAL EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO HAVE A RIGHT A PRESCHOOL CLASS RIGHT SO THEY WOULD STILL GO THROUGH THE SAFEGUARDS OF ARE GOING TO INDIAN HIRING AND WORKING WITH THESE KIDS SO. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SAFEGUARDS OF AB SCREENING PER SE AND IF I I'M NOT SURE IF THAT AS WITH ANOTHER THREE OR THE CHARITY CATION YEAH THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I THINK THAT. SO THERE'S UP THERE'S THE SAFETY SCREEN WITH IT AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DRESSED AND THERE'S I GUESS I CALLED THE CURRICULAR PART BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE THAN JUST WATCHING THE CHILD IT'S ALSO PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT SO FORTH AND WE WANT TO GET THESE OTHER PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THAT THAT COULD BE PART OF THE PROGRAM BUT ALL. OF THAT THIRTY THAT THAT I GUESS THE CHILD CARE PERSONNEL THE PROFESSIONAL OR THE CENTER IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THEY'RE NOT. EXCESSIVELY SPENT PUTTING PEOPLE ON. I GUESS. EXCEPT TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO. AREN'T THINKING ABOUT THE DEVELOP OR AT LEAST WORKING THEM TO BE SURE THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE DOES THAT. THAT COULD LEVEL SUPERVISION- AT A REALIZE THAT DESPITE COULD ALSO APPLY TO THE PUBLIC SIDE WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE WHICH I UNDERSTAND ANALYSIS WE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CAME ABOUT IN YOUR STATE. YOU KNOW MAKE IT SORT. OF ON THE PRIVATE SIDE. BUT I GUESS ARE STEPPING BACK. I JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT. THE REASON WE HAVE THESE STANDARDS IS ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILDREN WHO ARE PARTICIPATING. ARE GETTING YOU KNOW DEVELOPMENT THE APPROPRIATE- ACTIVITIES AND THAT- SINCE THE- SOME THE DEFICIT OTHER FOLKS AREN'T THAT'S NOT PART OF THEIR VALUATION- THAT- THAT. THE AT LEAST THE CHILD CARE CENTER STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BE SURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES THEY CHOSE TO DO THEM END UP WITH. ARE DEVELOPING A PROPERTY FOR THAT PARTICULAR AGE. SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN- YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD LOOK AT THAT I THINK IT I'M SURE YOU'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS- BUT- SO I AM I'M FINE WITH MOVING THIS BILL YOU KNOW IT'S TERM SUPPORTING THIS BILL. I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE DON'T HAVE TO CREATE A GAP THERE AND FRANKLY ACTUALLY EVEN ON THE PUBLIC SIDE SO THAT I. WAS WONDERING LIKE OK SO EXACTLY WAS A SUPERVISION. REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO A GUIDELINES FOR. THESE COACHES IN THESE OTHER FOLKS THAT THEY'RE BEING GAUGED. ABSOLUTELY AND I IF YOU'D LIKE SO BASICALLY. THESE ARE JUST SO THE ENTITIES THAT ACTUALLY HIRE THESE. THEY JUST RECOMMEND. THE VET THE PROGRAMS AND THEY HAVE TO VET TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COMPLEMENT THE EFFORTS OF THE SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING- YOU KNOW ASSISTED WITH EASE A PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENT ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS PER SE- SO I THINK. THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF VETTING AND LIABILITY THAT GOES INTO THAT BECAUSE IT IS. THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEM IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH IN TWO AND REGION PROGRAMS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR THESE KIDS. I'M BUT I'M NOT SURE IF- IF I MADE TO THE CHAIR IF MY AB- SUPPORT WITH AS MR JOBIN HAS ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO I WITH WITH THAT- WITH. YOUR QUESTION IN MIND. YES PLEASE. IF YOU WERE TO A QUICK RESPONSE. SURE THE ATTORNEY YES CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THE PRESCHOOL- OFFICIALS ARE ALWAYS ALLOWED TO REVIEW OUR CURRICULUM TO MAKE SURE SOMEONE TO PUT THEIR TEACHING OUR OWN PERSONAL PRIVILEGE ACTUALIZED WITH THIRTY CALIFORNIA EARLY LEARNING FOUNDATION SO WE TEACH THE EXACT SAME WAY THEY'RE TEACHING THE CLASSROOM THE ONLY THING THIS DOES IS DOING IF IT'S CREATING EQUAL ACCESS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PRIVATE PROGRAMS FOR WHAT PUBLIC PROGRAMS. RT AND THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIRING GREAT COACHES AND THEN. ON THE PRESCHOOL'S REVIEW OUR PROGRAM AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE A FIX FOR THEM. ALL THIS IS SAYING IS THAT WE WOULD NO LONGER. RIGHT IT FAMILY OWNED COMPANY HALF THE ONLY HIGHER PRESCHOOL TEACHERS. THE COACH FOR THIRTY FIVE MINUTES ON CAMPUS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER CORTESE- YES IT I'M GOING TO- YOU KNOW BE SUPPORTING MOVING THIS ALONG TO THEM AMONG THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE- AS THE AUTHOR GOES SO- WE'LL GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT MY ONLY CONCERN AND IT'S A BIG ONE FOR ME IT WAS JUST THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE ANALYSIS. FROM PAGE FIVE OF FIVE FORD POSES THE QUESTION OF SHOULD THIS BILL BE AMENDED TO CLARIFY THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSE EXAM PREP RECREATION PROGRAMS MUST BE OVER EIGHTEEN AND BE FINGERPRINTED BEFORE SERVICES ARE INSTRUCTIONS- INSTRUCTION TO CHILDREN AND I HEARD YOUR REASSURANCES ABOUT YOUR INTENT TODAY I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE THIS FAMILY. SEEN ANYTHING IN TERMS OF AN AMENDMENT THAT CLARIFIES CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK WORK- MAYBE IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE IN THE POINT THAT OUT TO ME BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT COMMITTEE BUT YOU KNOW THE INTEREST OF TIME I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT'LL BE. IT IN AN ONGOING CONCERN FOR ME TO SEE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY CLEARED UP IN THE LEGISLATION. THERE'S NO AMBIGUITY ABOUT THE- WILL HAPPY TO MAKE THIS CLEAR- AS CURRENTLY IT IT'S ALREADY PART OF THE PROCESS AND I BELIEVE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IF I'M- TO MY SUPER WAS JOANNE. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK OUT OF TURN BUT I BELIEVE THAT. EVERY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM HAS THE REQUIREMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IN ORDER TO HE HIRED TO WORK AT THESE FACILITIES THEY HAVE TO BE FINGERPRINTED. BUT IF YOU LIKE TO HAVE THAT-EXTRA LANGUAGE AND- CLARIFICATION THE BILL WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO AT THAT WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM. SHE DID AN AWFUL CLOSE MY ORDER BOOK THERE.
