00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.795
COMMITTEE. THIS EVENING OUR

00:30:30.862 --> 00:30:32.664
TOPIC IS THE CHANGING FACE OF

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.867
EXTREMISM. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:37.135
WITH HELD SEVERAL HEARINGS AND

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:38.937
EVENTS ON THE CURRENT STATE OF

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:40.605
HATE WITH DIFFERENT POINTS OF

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:43.942
FOCUS AT EACH HEARING. ALTHOUGH

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.410
WE'VE COVERED DIFFERENT TOPICS

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:46.945
OVER THE YEARS A COMMON THREAD

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:49.347
REMAINS HATE CRIMES AND OTHER

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:52.317
FORMS OF TARGETED VIOLENCE SEEM

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:54.519
ONLY TO BE TRENDING UPWARD. I'M

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:57.121
SAD TO REPORT THAT TWENTY TWENTY

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:58.389
ONE WAS THE WORST YEAR OVERALL

00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:00.992
FOR HATE CRIMES SINCE.TWO

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.727
THOUSAND ONE. OUR BIGGEST

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:04.963
CONCERNS ARE SHARED BY AB HAVE

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:06.798
BEEN INFORMED BY LEADING EXPERTS

00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:09.734
IN THE FIELD. SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.636
THERE'S A RISE IN LOAN ACTORS

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.638
THAT COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS THAT

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:14.973
SUBSCRIBE TO WHITE NATIONALIST

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:16.908
IDEOLOGY BUT WHO ARE NOT

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:19.544
NECESSARILY ACTING ON BEHALF OF

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:22.080
A PARTICULAR GROUP. THERE'S ALSO

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.214
THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:25.984
REGIONALIZATION. WE HAVE HOT

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.986
BUTTON LARGE SCALE ISSUES THAT

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:30.321
ARE PLAYING OUT AT LOCAL LEVELS

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:32.724
WHERE THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE. WE

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.292
THINK TARGETED VIOLENCE AND

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:35.860
AGGRESSION BEYOND TRADITIONAL

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:38.496
HATE CRIME TARGETS PEOPLE X. GOT

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.031

AND OTHER CIVIL SERVANTS.

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:46.304
ADDITIONALLY THE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:31:46.371 --> 00:31:48.373
THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:51.209
TARGETED AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.112
SOCIAL MEDIA AND FREE SPEECH IS

00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:56.481
QUICKLY GROWING. OVER THE YEARS

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.983
WE'VE HOSTED THESE HEARINGS ONE

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.885
THING BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:02.687

OFF THE FACE A. N. N. AND IT

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.693
WASN'T JUST ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.195

WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT- ART.

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:57.355
DISTRICT TOOK ACTION AND IT

00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:00.558
WASN'T. IT WAS A GRASSROOTS

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:02.693
MOVEMENT REALLY WRE WE JOIN THE

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.361
MOVEMENT WITH AT LEAST IT WOULD

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:05.129
JOIN THE MOVEMENT OF BOTH ALL

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:07.465
THE WAY FROM KOREATOWN TO LITTLE

00:36:07.532 --> 00:36:09.700
TOKYO IN AND MARCHING AND

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:12.169
CALLING TO ACTION IN AND

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:13.938
GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING NONPROFIT

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:17.775
ORGANIZING IN CARAVANS UP AND

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:19.043
DOWN TRYING TO SHUT THE ALARM OF

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.512
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED- AT A VERY

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:22.480
BASIC CHORDS THAT YOU CAN'T

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:24.549
TOLERATE IT AT ANY LEVEL AND YOU

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.017
CAN'T TOLERATE IT NO MATTER WHAT

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:27.952
THE AGES WHETHER A KID IS. FIVE

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.355
YEARS OF AGE OR EIGHTEEN OR

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.256
FORTY FIVE YOU CALL IT OUT FOR

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:35.126
WHAT IT IS- AND YOU STOP IT WERE

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:38.496
ATTACKED N. YOU CAN'T STAND TO

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:42.133
BE AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER- WHAT

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.935
WE FOUND VERY EFFECTIVE. IS THAT

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:46.571
WOULD YOU MAKE IT NOT COOL WHEN

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:47.738
YOU CALLED OUT FOR WHAT IT IS

00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:49.373
WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY DOING IT

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.708
THAT SOMEONE ACROSS THE STREET.

00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:52.343
AND YOU WALK ACROSS THE STREET

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.411
ENJOYING THAT PERSON IS

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:56.013
SOLITARY. IT DOES HELP. AND I

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.215
THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS- THAT

00:36:58.282 --> 00:36:59.817
WHILE WE PUSH FOR ALL THE

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.485
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND WE

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:02.553
SHOULD AND WHY WE PUSH FOR THE

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.922
BUDGET. I THAT WE HAVE IN IN

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:07.825
THERE WAS A PIECE- THAT FUNDED-

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:11.429
STOP API- WHICH WAS- WHAT WHICH

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:12.964
IS FUNDED THROUGH UCLA THAT THE

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.632
PROGRAM THAT I KNOW. YOU WORKED

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:16.634
ON IN THIS REYES WORKED ON WILL

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:17.735
PUSH VERY HARD TO DO WHICH

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:18.903
COLLECTS THE DATA THEN THEN

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.571
QUANTIFIES OUR ABILITY TO SAY

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.406
THIS IS REALLY A PROBLEM WE KNOW

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:23.708
THE PUMP IT'S GOT QUALIFIED IN

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.543
DATA. AND WE KNOW THAT FOR EVERY

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.380
PER THING THAT IS REPORTED.

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:29.981
THERE ARE LOTS. MORE THAT WERE

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:33.851
NOT. I THINK WHAT WHAT WHAT-

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.653
WHAT WE LEARNED IS IT IS WE'VE

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.188
GOT A JOINT FOLLOWED AND CALLED

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:38.723
OUT FOR WHAT IT IS WHEN IT

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:39.757
HAPPENS YOU CAN BE AN INNOCENT

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:41.959
BYSTANDER AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:45.696
THE LARGEST- I THINK. ONE OF THE

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.431
LARGEST MOVEMENT TO SUPPRESSION

00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:48.933
TO THAT SORT OF HATE. IS THAT

IN GERMANY'S IS A WORLDWIDE

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.182
PROBLEM AT THIS PARTICULAR WHITE

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:20.684

ELEVEN- DEFINITELY LARGE

INCREASES- DURING THE TRUMP

LEADS TO- THE L. OR LENDS ITSELF

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:56.997
TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING

OF UNDERSTANDING THAT FREQUENTLY

01:49:02.769 --> 01:49:06.606
