RIGHT NOW FAMILIES OF EVER SAY MILLION. PUBLIC SCHOOL AGE. KIDS ARE SELDOM IN PLACE AND WOULD HAVE TO WHICH IS ONLINE A- HAVE THEIR PARENTS BIG SISTER BROTHER GRANDMA GRANDPA. BECOME THE TEACHER- MANY KIDS ARE ISOLATED AND STRESSED IN THEIR HOMES AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND EQUITABLE MANNER. BECAUSE NOT ALL FAMILIES HAVE FRANKLY WHAT MY FAMILY HAS I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ON THIS DíAS HAVE SHARED THEIR EXPERIENCES. OUR GIRLS ARE AT HOME LUCKY THERE THERE ARE DAYS FILLED WITH THEIR RESUME CALLS WITH THEIR FRIENDS AFTER THEIR CLASS THEIR CLASSROOM CHATS THEIR ENRICHMENT PROJECTS WITH THEIR TEACHERS THERE. KHANACADEMY WITH MATH- P. E. EVERY NOW AND THEN IF WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY. BUT NOT ALL FAMILIES AND KIDS ARE ARE SO LUCKY. SOME FAMILIES DON'T YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE TOOLS TO DO WITH HIS SCHOOL WORK WHETHER IT'S A COMPUTER. OR INTERNET ACCESS SO THAT WILL BE A BIG PART. OF TODAY'S HEARING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN. DON'T LOSE A YEAR OF EDUCATION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPTHE OPPORTUNITY GAP IS REAL AND WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE OUR KIDS OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE ON OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM SO PARAMOUNT TO. WHAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON IN CALIFORNIA. SO THIS PANDEMIC RECESSION HAD HAS A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WE WILL HAVE MANY MORE. QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS BUT WE WANT TO GET DIG DOWN INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES AND KIDS HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO SUCCEED- WE WILL HAVE A FEW PANELS TODAY WILL FOCUS FIRST ON- THE- COVE IN NINETEEN IMPACTS ON SCHOOL FINANCES ACCOUNTABILITY AND SAFETY.

MY DISTRICT GOES FROM- LARGE URBAN DISTRICT LIKE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED TO THE SMALLER SUBURBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF THE SOUTH BAY AND SO THERE'S BEEN A WIDE RANGE. EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF- HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE REALITIES OF DISTANCE LEARNING WE SEE STARKLY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE GAP IN THE ACCESS WITH THE DEVICES- ACCESS TO THE INTERNET- IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF MY DISTRICT WHICH I KNOW IS- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THEY WERE FACING- IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SPACE- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ADDRESSING THESE AND MANY OTHER ISSUES AND THIS- HEARING TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA. THANK YOU I ALSO- AND GLAD THAT WE'RE CONVENING I KNOW THAT YESTERDAY'S CONVERSATION- FOR BUDGET SAID SIX A WAS- FOCUSED ON REALLY WHAT RECOVERING WITH THE ECONOMY WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT CAME UP FROM ONE OF OUR PANELISTS WAS THAT. EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS AND NEEDED TO BE PART OF THAT THAT YOU CAN'T THINK OF AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY WITH OUT THE IDEA THAT TO SCHOOLS WITH POTENTIALLY OPEN UP SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE DISTRICTS NO MATTER WHERE THEY'RE AT COASTAL IN LAND NOR IT'S SOUTH- IT RURAL YOU KNOW BEEN THEY ARE SHARING SO MANY ISSUES AT THIS MOMENT THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT FOR BOTH K. TWELVE AND HIGHER AT- SO I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT THIS WILL BE. A VERY VERY KEY AND IMPORTANT PART OF HOW WE MOVE FORWARD- IN THE STATE INCLUDING WE THINK ABOUT. OR THANK YOU. OKAY NO FURTHER QUESTIONS LET'S NOW PROCEED WITH OUR PANEL WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LA L. AND AFFIRMATIVE EDUCATION. GOOD IT'S GOING FIRST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THIS IS JESSICA HOMES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO YOU AND ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT ARE ON THIS POINT. I'M GIVEN WHERE WE ARE WITH ME REVISION TO MAYBE I CAN'T PROVIDE MENTAL CLARITY ON BUT I WILL DO MY BEST AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I. OKAY LA OF. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AGREE CABRAL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M IN WE HAD A BRIEF HANDOUT THAT WE PUT TOGETHER THAT I BELIEVE- SHOULD BE- DISTRIBUTED TO YOU THAT I WAS GONNA USE OF THAT OUR BASIS FOR SOME OF MY COMMENTS TODAY- FOR A PROPOSED YOUR WATCHING ON THE LIVE STREAM OR HAND OUT IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE LA DOT VA DOT G. O. V. I'M- IN. IOWA HER. TOUCH ON THREE ISSUES. IS JUST. QUICK SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE FEEDBACK. THAT OF A- I'M A RESULT OF THE- BUYERS OUTBREAK. WHAT ABOUT AVAILABLE. FOR AND THEN JUST MAKE SOME. COME ABOUT THE FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR SCHOOLS MORE PEOPLE. I'M FIRST ON ON PAGE ONE THE HEAD OUT IF YOU HAVE WE HIGHLIGHTS FROM. THE AS AN IS JUST GIVE YOU A FUND FOR. WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF SINCE WE HAD A OUR- ME HEARING IN TERMS OF. HOW THINGS CHANGED FOR SCHOOLS ARE A- UNDER A NUMBER OF EXACT ORDERS BY THE- I'M THERE'D BE. OF ALL THE OF LEGISLATION PASS BY BLOOD. AND NUMEROUS. GOT AND DOCUMENTS TO TRY TO SCHOOLS UNDERSTAND OUT OF. THERE ARE A IN THIS IS. ON THE- OF WHAT HAPPENED. THREE KEY THANK YOU THINGS THAT THAT ARE GOING ON. FIRST IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO. SCHOOL FIFTY HARMLESS FROM SCHOOL CLOSER. I'M THE MOST NOTABLE THOSE ARE CHANGE WAS A CHANGE OF STATURE. THAT THE THAT SCHOOL. I WILL NOT BE PENALIZED. FOR HAVING A FULL. A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. YEAR FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S- IDEAL HERE BEING. WE ARE A- THAT. WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS. OF THE- BY. TO OF THE OF PUBLIC. ISSUES. I'M NOT THE FINAL THING THAT THE CURRENT IS- BUT THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS IS TRYING TO SET CLEAR EXPECTATIONS- FOR SCHOOLS IT- BUT I DO CLOSE ABOUT WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM. MEN ARE ALL HIGHLY THREE KEEP IS THE FIRST IS THAT- WATER SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED THERE ARE. EDUCATION OFF THE OLD SCHOOL THE TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING. I'M YOU HAVE A SUBSCRIBER PANEL NOT WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN DETAIL SCHOOLS ABOUT THE PIVOT FAIRLY QUICKLY. MOVED TO DISTANCE LEARNING ABOUT AT A NUMBER OF IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. THE NEXT EXPECTATION IF THAT SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MEALS WITH STUDENTS- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THEN ARE. PROVIDED IN PART THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY IN THE PHONE TREATMENT PROGRAM. THAT ALLOWS- SCHOOLS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN THE WAY THAT THE DELIVERABLES MEALS FROM. AND FINALLY THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO PAY DOWN PLEASE. I'M ON ON THE NEXT PAGE WE HAVE SOME BASIC INFORMATION ON SOME OF THE KEY FUNDING SOURCES IN. THE FEDERAL CARRIES OUT THE WITH THE REFERRAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT IT PROVIDED FUNDING- I'M THE ONE THAT HAS THE EDUCATION FUNDING IS THE CARE THAT. I'M THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY POTS THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE THE TOTAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THE FIRST PART OF MONEY WHICH IS- THAT ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY FUNDING IS THE LARGEST SOURCE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PRIMARILY WILL GO DIRECTLY. TO SCHOOLS AND OUR SCHOOLS HAVE PRETTY BROAD- THERE ARE SOME BROUGHT ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE USED ATTORNEY COULD BE USED FOR- UP KEPT AT THE STATE LEVEL PARTS THEY DECISION. ONE IN THE NEXT TO POP FUNDING IS THE GOVERNOR'S. EMERGENCY OUR EDUCATION RELIEF THAT'S K. TWELVE OR HIGHER EDUCATION BUT ARE ELIGIBLE- USES OF FUNDING. AND TV BGS CHALKER AND- CHOCOLATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE KIND OF ON A PROGRAMS. OF THOSE FUNDS WILL GO TO THE STATE AND THE STATE WILL ULTIMATELY DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE. ARE NONE MOVING ON TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET OUTLOOK- THINKING ABOUT WHAT LOOKSLIKE FOR SCHOOLS I MEAN. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM A PREVIOUS FIVE THERE ARE SOME FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE. WE DO THINK BASED ON OVERSEEING A RECORD ON THE ECONOMY THAT IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE MUCH LESS THAN THE POTENTIAL- BUDGET AFFECTS- THE GOVERNOR OF THE RECESSION- IN AS A RESULT OF THE- VIRUS WE DO. IF I HAVE ANY NUMBER THING OUT- UNEMPLOYMENT AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS WE DO THINK WE ARE IN A STEP RECESSION AND THAT LIKELY MEANS A REDUCTION IN STATE FUNDING. AND ARE LIKELY REDUCTION IN OUR FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. I'M SCHOOLS INSTALL SCHOOL DISTRICT THEMSELVES TO HAVE- SOME RESERVES AVAILABLE THE SERVICE THAT DOES I CAN HELP CUSHION- SOME OF THE EFFECTIVE REDUCTIONS- BUT THAT IS PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TO WEATHER A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN. AND I CAN JUST GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SO IT IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AT THE END OF THAT YEAR. SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ALMOST THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN UNDER. RESERVES AVAILABLE. NOW NOW ALL THAT FUNDING ISN'T ALWAYS AVAILABLE- FROM THAT IS AROUND BECAUSE DISTRICTS MY HAVE CASH FLOW NEEDS. OR THEY MIGHT HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED IN SOME CONTRACTS FOR SOME EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGY PRINCES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. NOT ALL THERE IS ALWAYS A FAIRLY AGREEABLE BUT THAT DOES GIVE YOU SOME QUESTION. AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN DISTRICTS HAD PRIOR TO. THE GREAT RECESSION- AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FISCAL EFFECTS MIGHT BE OF THIS RECESSION BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN EIGHT NINE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE STATE PASSED THE BUDGET. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND MADE THAT HAD FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR PROPOSITION EIGHT FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE THE END OF THAT YEAR- THERE WERE MULTIPLE REVISIONS TO THAT BUDGET AND THE STATE ULTIMATELY PROVIDED FORTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS I WAS A NINE BILLION DOLLAR CUT. WITHIN THAT YEAR- IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT WERE TO OCCUR IN THIS SITUATION AND DISTRICTS WERE TO ATTEMPT TO. OR USE THE RESERVES TO QUESTION THOSE REDUCTIONS. IT WHERE IT WENT OUR- REDUCE MOST OF THE FUNDING OF THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE- SO THEY ARE THERE TO HELP IN SOME CASES BUT THERE THERE IS. BILL NOT ENOUGH TO SURF COMPLETELY QUESTIONER OR KEEP OUR DISTRICTS ARE. NOT HAVING TO CONSIDER MAKING BUDGET REDUCTIONS. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS THE STATE. CAN MAKE REDUCTION SOME OF THEM ARE THE STREET. OUR CUSTOMER CUTS. ARE GONNA CUTS THE PROGRAMS- BUT THERE'S ALSO THINGS LIKE AND PAYMENT DEFERRALS ANOTHER OPTIONS JUST DID IN THE PAST THAT- HAVE THEIR OWN SET OF SOME OF THE- THESE BUDGET REDUCTIONS MISTER LEE AFFECT REDUCTIONS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THESE A LOT MORE DETAILING. IN CULINARY. I'M THIRTY COUPLE MORE THAN GOOD FOR THE HIGHLIGHT. OR ONE OR I WANT TO IS THE ISSUE OF THE UNCERTAINTY. HOUSE OUR FREE IN THINKING ABOUT WITH CLINIC SCHOOL YEAR. WITH ANY RARE. THERE'S THE AND OF GOING ON AND THIS RECESS NOW COULD RESULT IN HAVING TO MAKE MORE BUDGET RE VERSIONS OF THEM. THE IN PREVIOUS SUBCOMMITTEE YOU MIGHT HAVE. ARE A BUNCH OF ITS PASSENGER THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE UPDATED IN SAY AUGUST WHEN I UPDATED TAX RECEIPTS BECOME AVAILABLE- THAT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PLAN- IF YOU SAY COMING TO MAKE REDUCTIONS. THERE ARE REDUCTIONS IN AUGUST. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TYPICALLY BEGINNING THE SCHOOL YEAR AT THE END OF AUGUST OR THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. AT IS AND NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THEM TO RESPOND AND REACT AND CHANGE THEIR PLANS. FOR WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO MORE- MOST OF THE TIME AND SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR DISTRICTS TO DOUBLES CUTS. ON AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS RECESSION IT HAPPENED IN THE DOT COM BUST WITH THIS THEY HAVE TO GO IN IN THE MEDIA REDUCTION AND THESE ARE. ALWAYS DIFFICULT OUR CHALLENGES DURING OUR- OUR DRINKS ARE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. THE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY. THAT I WILL HIGHLIGHT HERE THE IS UNIQUE. IN THIS BUT- AT ISSUE BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE PANDEMIC. IS JUST A GREAT RUN. ABOUT WHAT PROGRAMS EVEN LOOK LIKE WHEN SCHOOL STARTS. ON AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMóN MENTIONED AT IT YESTERDAY IS A SUB SIX HEARING THERE WASN'T. ARE THE ISSUE OF SCHOOLS BEING ARE. CLOSE WAS HIGHLIGHTED AS A AS A PROBLEM FOR GETTING THE ECONOMY UP AND RUNNING AND SO. THERE IS SOME PRESSURE FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN- BUT- IF THEY DO OPEN THAT MIGHT BE DEVELOP VERY DIFFERENTLY AND SO. AS THE STATE OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BALANCE ITS BUDGET AND WHETHER ANYTHING BUT THE REDUCTIONS. ON THERE ALSO THESE ISSUES OF THINKING ABOUT WILL. WATER WHAT DO WE EXPECT SCHOOLS TO LOOK LIKE AND- THAT MIGHT HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE CHANGES IN EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT.AUTHORIZES LOOK LIKE IF. FOR EXAMPLE YOU NEED TO HAVE STUDENTS BE SIXTY APART. THAT MIGHT CHANGE EXPECTED WHAT DISTRICTS NEED FOR PERSONNEL. AND HAVE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS ALL THOSE THINGS WILL BE. WITH THE PART OF THE CONVERSATION AS YOU'RE DELIBERATING ON HOW TO ON. WHICH INCLUDING THE- SO I WILL STOP THEIR- BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANSWER ANY. YOU MIGHT. OKAY WILL COME BACK TO YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE A LISA CONSTRAINTS- HERE IN A LITTLE BIT YOU'RE STEIN FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFIC TO ADD BUT WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY. OKAY WASN'T PREPARED FOR THAT BRIEF PRESENTATION BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT WE WILL GET ON WITH OUR OUR QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS I HAVE A FEW BUT DEVELOPING A FIRST TWO OTHER. COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER O'DONNELL- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATIONS AND I REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I MIGHT ASK EVEN THE OTHER MEMBERS MIGHT ASK IF THEY'RE JUST UNKNOWNS AT THIS TIME BUT THEY ARE. JUST QUESTIONS WE SHOULD START PONDERING- AT THIS POINT THE EXPERIENCE WHICH IS. CERTAINLY GOING TO. IMPACT OUR THINKING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. BUT IS IT A MINUTE AND I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS QUESTIONS FORCE TO ANYONE OF YOU CAN JUMP ON IT DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE COVERT RELATED COSTS ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OTHER WORDS IS A READ A SURVEY- AT ALL WITH THE EITHER ALL DISTRICTS ARE NUMBER DISTRICTS TO IDENTIFY THE INCREASED COSTS THEY HAVE SEEN BECAUSE OF. THE COVERT RESPONSE. I DON'T WOULD BE FINANCER DEPART OF EDUCATION. SO JUST GO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE'VE RECEIVED AS SOME. CASE BY CASE- INFORMATION FROM CERTAIN DISTRICTS WHO ARE TRACKING THIS INFORMATION- OUR SENSE IS THAT NOT ALL DISTRICTS AT THIS POINT HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO GET THEIR ARMS AROUND THE COST OF THEIR INCURRING. IT DOES SEEM TO BE. BUT ANYHOW REPAIRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BANDS TO- DO. BUSINESS LEARNING OR PROVIDING MEALS- IN A IN A MODIFIED MANNER I'M SO IN TERMS. WILL STATEWIDE VALUE WE DON'T HAVE THAT BUT WE ARE HEARING ON SOME ISOLATED INDIVIDUAL- ESTIMATIONS OF THE COST THE INDIVIDUAL. THANK YOU AND I IMAGINE IN SOME CASES. THERE MAYBE EVEN SOME SAVINGS DOES MEAN THAT WHEN WE OVERALL INCREASE EXPENDITURES BUT THERE MAY BE SOME SPOTS DISTRICTS ARE SAVING THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO NOTE AS WELL. BUT WITH REGARD TO PROVIDING DISTANCE LEARNING I THIS IS A CAN TO THE LAST QUESTIONI DON'T KNOW WE HAVE A SURVEY OF DISTRICTS OF THE COST. THEY BORN. TO INCREASE THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING I KNOW MY OWN ONE OF MY OWN DISTRICTS. HAD A BY A NUMBER OF- MOBILE DEVICES. A COUPLE THOUSAND AS I UNDERSTAND IT SO. DO WE KNOW- ON AVERAGE WHAT DISTRICTS. ARE HAVING TO SPEND TO ALLOW FOR STUDENTS TO DISTANCE LEARN. OR THE WAY THAT THEY JUST MIGHT BE SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SHOULD THINK ABOUT SOMETIMES SURVEY TO IDENTIFY THAT GAP WHERE IS THE DELTA HOW MANY DEVICES. DID DISTRICTS ON AVERAGE HAVE AND HOW MANY DID THEY NEED TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION IF YOU WILL TO PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING THAT BE SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT HAVING SOME SOME DISTRICTS. ARE YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY HAD A NUMBER OF MOBILE DEVICES THERE ARE ALREADY ASSIGNED TO STUDENTS. A SOME DISTRICTS DIDN'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE NUMBER I KNOW SOMEONE OUT PURCHASED AT SUMMER PROBABLY HAVE. AND I'VE ARE WAITING FOR THEM TO SHOW UP. SOME MAY HAVE OTHER PLANS I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD IDENTIFY BECAUSE I THINK. THE DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL IS SOMETHING WE MIGHT HAVE TO BOUNCE IN AND OUT OF NEXT YEAR. THROUGHOUT THE THAT THE SCHOOL YEAR EXPERIENCE. AND QUITE FRANKLY AS A TEACHER. I MEAN I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE DAILY EXPERIENCE OF STUDENTS WHERE AN- YEAH THEY GO TO SCHOOL. IN A PERFECT WORLD TO GO TO SCHOOL DURING THE DAY BUT THEY CAN ALSO SOME MORE ACCESS. ACCESS TO MORE ENHANCED. ONLINE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES- WHEN THEY GET HOME. TO BACK UP. THEIR IN SCHOOL EDUCATION- DURING THE DAY BECAUSE I AM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT STUDENTS DO NEED TO GO. TO A SCHOOL GO TO SCHOOL. BUT I THINK CALIFORNIA ON A LOOK AT A SYSTEM THAT'S MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN WE HAVE NOW. MUCH MORE FORMALIZED WITH ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS POLICIES ETCETERA- TO PROVIDE- STUDENTS TO ACCESS- THROUGH DEVICE AT HOME- LEARNING. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. I KNOW WE HAVE SOME SCHOOLS THAT HVE BEEN DOING AND I NEED TO TAKE A LOOKAT THAT. I THINK IT. CERTAINLY VERY SAN RECORD FOR SURE WE I THINK THE DATA REFLECTS THAT. BUT THAT'S SMETHING AS A STATE AND AS A COMMITTEE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PONDER AS WE GO INTO NEXT YEAR- HOW DO WE DO THIS. I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS I'VE BEEN MAINLY IN IN CLASSROOM TEACHER. TAKEN SOME DISTANCE CLASSES MYSELF. BUT I DON'T KNOW THE PLATFORMS. THAT ALWAYS THERE. THEIR RADIO PRIVATE PROVIDERS AT. THAT PROVIDE THEM NOW THERE'S SCHOOL OLOGY THEIR SCHOOL UP THERE SOME OTHERS. TOO I THINK POWER SCHOOLS OVER IN FOLSOM IN FACT. THAT'S ONE OF I RECALL CORRECTLY. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS A STATE IS ESTABLISH WHAT A GOOD PLATFORM LOOKS LIKE WHAT TOOLS IT SHOULD HAVE SO TEACHER CAN BUILD A LESSON. AND THEN PUSH THAT OUT- MAYBE THROUGH THE DAY BUT ALSO. AFTER THE SCHOOL DAY ON A ON AN ONGOING BASIS NOT YOURS DURING TIMES OF NEED. BUT IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE MORSE FOR MORE SEAMLESS TRANSITION. DURING DURING OUR TIMES OF A- DURING ARM ARE WHEN WE HAVE EMERGENCIES BE THEY FIRES MUDSLIDES OR SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE. LIKE WE ARE EXPERIENCING A RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE ALL OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT AS A BODY AND I HOPE THE DEPARTMENTS WILL CONTEMPLATE AS WELL- WE NEED TO GET MOVING SO THAT I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER EARLY AMOUNT THANK YOU AT I EIGHT THINK THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND CERTAINLY DISTANCE EARNING IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THEM- THAT YEAH AND I THINK THAT THE COST OF THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF BUT ALSO- THE TECHNOLOGY THERE'S A COST TO THE TECHNOLOGY WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD- THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED I KNOW OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION- HAS FORMED A TASK FORCE. TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE REAL DIGITAL DIVIDE- IN IN OUR STATE- IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS SO IDO HOPE AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS UPDATED ON THAT I HAVE- A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS IN AND I WANT TO ASK. IN TERMS OF ITS SCHOOL MEALS AND FUNDING AND AT WHAT AT WHAT FUNDING RESOURCES ARE DISTRICTS AT THIS POINT USING- TO PROVIDE THESE MEALS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF A- THAT. DISCUSSION ABOUT- WHETHER OR NOT DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE MEALS- WE ARE GOING INTO A SUMMER AND- THE SUMMER WAS ALWAYS A TIME. WHERE SO YOU SAW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE WHETHER THEY WERE IN SCHOOL OR NOT- PROVIDE SOME OF THESE MEALS- SO I I'M I'M LOOKING TO SEE WHAT AGAIN THE FUNDING RESOURCES ARE WHAT'S BEING DONE. IS THIS A SUSTAINABLE THROUGH THE SUMMER I THINK WE ARE- AT A STATE THAT BENEFITS SO GREATLY FROM- THE AD THAT'S HERE- BUT AND I'M PROUD THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT HEARING SOME OF THE STORIES WE ARE IN OTHER STATES WHERE WE SEE THAT OUR ADS ARE- YOU KNOW COMMUNITY IS WORKING WITH NON PROFITS AND- WE- WE DON'T SEE THE WASTE. HAPPENING BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THIS% MEANS FOR STUDENTS WHO RELIED- A PRIMARILY ON GETTING FOOD- FROM THEIR SCHOOL SO IF WE COULD HAVE HAD SOMEONE COMMENT ON THAT THAT WOULD BE GRET. I THINK WE LOST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR A FEW SECONDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE ALEJO WANT TO TAKE A CRACK AT THAT. GREAT THANK YOU. THAT GIRL ACROSS THE LA I THINK I CAN TALK MORE BROADLY ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THIS IS A SIMILAR ISSUE WHERE THE EXACT- COSTS ARE SOMETHING SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY AT THIS POINT OR HOPING THAT WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME WE GET SOME. OF THE COMMISSION ON MEALSREPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND GIVES US A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON- BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF PROVIDED A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY- SO THAT SCHOOLS CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MEALS AND- SETTINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS- WAS REQUIRED PREVIOUSLY SO NOW FOR EXAMPLE PARENTS KATIC PICKUP MEALS- THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE PROVIDED IN GROUP SETTINGS- IT'S ABOUT- AND YOU CAN ALSO CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THESE NIELSEN IN. FIVE STEPS PERHAPS PREVIOUSLY WHAT AUTHORIZED THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOLS WELL- TO STILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE KNOWS AND GET THEM REIMBURSED I'M MORE WE HAVE HEARD SOME CONCERNS ARE JUST OF THE NUMBER OF MEALS THAT- SCHOOLS ARE- ISSUING ARE MUCH LOWER THAN WHEN SCHOOL IS IN SESSION AND- AS A RESULT THAT IS GOING TO REDUCE THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT SCHOOLS ARE GETTING FROM- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE STATE IN TERMS OF A MEAL REIMBURSEMENT. THAT THE WAY THE FUNDING WORKS WE TYPICALLY PROVIDED ON A PER A PREMIER ACCOUNT- SO- FOR DISTRICTS WOULD BE OUT OF DATE BY AND LARGE HAVE THEIR SAME STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THERE'S THEY'RE PAYING THE STATE'S STAFF- TO DO THE WORK AND THEN THAT THE AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE GETTING NOW FROM THE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS LOWER THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE HEARD OF THE CONSERVE SIDES IT'S NOT THAT THAT THERE IS AN FUNDING BUT THAT THE AMOUNT THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET HIS LICENSE SO THAT'LL BE PART OF THE COST PRESSURE- WE ARE ARE HOPING THAT WITH A LITTLE MORE TIME TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT THAT LOOK LIKE WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT HAS BEEN- BUT WE KNOW THAT ARE ALSO VERY NICE BY SCHOOL SITE. AND MY DISTRICT. THANK YOU. I'M THE OTHER A PEACE I WAS. TO A LITTLE BIT IN FOR. OF WHAT. YOU KNOW CUT THE COST AND THAT WE'RE SEEING AND WHETHER IT'S NOW OR WHETHER IT'S IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO- SOME OF OUR UNDER REPRESENTED A STUDENT COMMUNITIES ENGLISH LEARNERS- AIDS A POPULATION THAT WE ARE AND- I MEAN WE'VE KNOWN- PRIOR TO THIS THAT- EDUCATING ENGLISH LEARNER LEARNERS- IT DIDN'T REQUIRE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION BUT NOW THAT YOU COMBINED THE POTENTIAL DIGITAL DIVIDE. WITH THIS EIGHT SEEMS PARTICULARLY MORE DIFFICULT- SO CAN WE COMMENT ON WHAT WE KNOW IS OR IS NOT HAPPENING- WITH OUR ENGLISH LEARNER COMMUNITY HERE IN THE STATE. I WOULD SAY A I THINK YOU'RE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ISSUES FOR A WIRE OR DIFFICULT ONE AS I SUGGESTED FOR. STUDENTS MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THE DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY RIGHT NOW. WHERE WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF TIME SCHOOL DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SORT OF IMPLEMENTED IN A SORT OF. AWFUL GRADUAL MANNER THIS IS SORT OF JUST HAPPENED ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S BEEN ARE A REST TO ADAPT SO IN BECAUSE OF THAT. THAT SOME STUDENTS ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR EXAMPLE BY STOPPING WOULD REALLY BENEFIT WITH HAVING- SOMEBODY THERE THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING THE DISTANCE LEARNING- IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU DO HAVE THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH. OUR JUST STUDENTS NOT HAVING ACCESS EITHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A DEVICE WE DON'T HAVE- INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OR MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A OF ENVIRONMENT IT'S VERY SUITABLE FOR LEARNING AT HOME. I'M BILLS ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT IT HAPPENED I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. I WILL BE OUT THERE ARE PARTICULARLY BIG IMPORTANCE IF WE DO AS AS A MEMBER OF DAHLE MENTION GO IN AND OUT OF THE BURNING IF WE DON'T GET. THE TERRIBLE WOULD BE MORE THOUGHT OF IN TERMS OF HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OUR PLANS ARE IN PLACE FOR THE STUDENTS- BUT IT IS A GET SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT A WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR- A NO IN A PARTICULAR OF THAT. ANYTHING THAT WE KNOW OF DATA OF WHAT'S GOING ON OR WHAT- BUT THEM SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU AND I THAT PIECE OF DATA WE MEAN. HAVE OUR- DISTRICTS- I MEAN IT'S VERY HARD FOR THEM I AND I DON'T KNOW WE CAN ASK. MORE IN IN A TIME LIKE THIS BUT IS THERE A WAY THAT WE'RE COLLECTING OR CAPTURING SOME OF THIS DATA TO BETTER INFORM US. ON ON WHAT IS OR IS NOT HAPPENING. TECH SPECIFIC THERE- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE COLLECTING BUT I THINK- I DON'T KNOW IF- THE I KNOW THAT PART OF IT HAS ANYTHING. TO COLOR I THINK THERE. ARE THIS IS PART CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF DECIDING HOW DO WE- ADDRESS NOT JUST AND I THINK I'LL TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT PANEL HOW DO WE ADDRESS POTENTIALLY. LEARNING LOSS THAT MIGHT OCCUR DURING THESE CLOSERS IN THROUGH THE SUMMER. AND HOW. SERVICES THAN CHANGE IN THE NEXT UPCOMING YEAR TO SERVE ME COUPLES- FOR THAT- LACK OF ADDITIONAL ATTENTION FOR STUDENTS. THANK YOU AND LAST QUESTION ON THE LA ESTIMATED THAT CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CARES ACT. OF WHICH ONE POINT SIX BILLION OF THAT IS FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. HAS THAT FUNDING DIRECTLY REACH THE SCHOOLS. THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO THE ONE POINT SIX FIVE BILLION THAT WE ARE RECEIVING FROM THE- CARES ACT FUNDING- WE RECEIVED A NOTICE THAT THE AWARD LAST WEEK WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON FILLING OUT THE APPLICATION IN ORDER TO DRAW DOWN THE FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO AND THE FUNDS HAVE NOT YET MADE IT TO SCHOOLS BUT WE ARE WORKING VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO WHEN DO WE EXPECT THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD REACH THE SCHOOLS. SEN I THIS IS A GREAT STATE CHIEF DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SORRY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO JUMP IN AND BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS YOU HAD RELATED TO SEVERAL PIECES SO REGARDING THE CARE IS ACTIVE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS IN FILLING OUT THE APPLICATION FOR THAT. THE FUNDING THAT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO OUR ELEAZAR. THAT FUNDING WILL BE ABLE TO BE JUST DISTRIBUTED TO L. A.'S OUT AROUND JULY FIRST. THANK YOU AND ALSO IN QUESTION YOU HAD QUESTIONS AROUND THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS TO. WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN SURVEYING OVER AT THE SAME OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS REGARDING THEIR TECHNOLOGY NEEDS AND I WE HAVE THE DATA COLLECTED FROM EVERY ALMOST EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE REGARDING THEIR DEVICE NEEDS AND THEIR HOT SPOT NEEDS AND RIGHT NOW THAT NUMBER IS OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND. OR DEVICES AND OVER TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND FOUR HOT SPOT AND I'LL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT WHEN WE DISCUSS ISSUED TO ALSO IN REGARDS TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND WHAT WE'RE BE ABLE WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE AND SUPPORT FOR THEM IS WE'VE HAD SPECIFIC SUPPORT AROUND SUPPORTING ENGLISH LEARNERS AND THIS TIME AND DISTANCE LEARNING. THROUGH GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS WEBINARS THAT ARE DIRECTLY FOR EDUCATORS WE HAVE ONE HAPPENING THIS WEEK AND ONE COMING UP IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AS WELL. EIGHT THANK YOU AND- WHEN IT WENT WHEN THAT FUNDING COMES- TO THE WAS SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHEN IT REACHES A SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL. WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO IS IT GOING TO BE FOR SPECIFIC USES ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW DISTRICTS TO USE THEM AS THEY NEED I KNOW THAT. IN A TIME LIKE THIS WE DON'T HAVE THE WAY TO AUGMENT- MORE FUNDING BUT CERTAINLY THERE IS AT REQUEST FOR AT SOME LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY IN A TIME OF NEED WHERE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES AND I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE'S- ARE THERE GONNA BE ANY GUIDELINES FOR THAT. I AM STEP GREAT SO FROM THAT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THERE IS FULL FLEXIBILITY FOR OUR ELLIE AIDS AND HOW THEY SPEND THIS MONEY COMING FROM THE FEDERAL. THANK YOU THAT'S ALL THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU- I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ALL GOING TO COME BACK AFTER THE MEMBERS GO BUT JUST MAYBE ON THIS QUESTION REAL QUICK SO I THINK THIS IS KEY. IS WE DO THAT FEDERAL MONEY THAT WHERE WHERE COUNTING ON IT IT'S OUR HOPE THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY GET MORE IN THE NEXT ROUND THAT CONGRESS IS STILL. IN RIGHT NOW AS WE LOOK BACK IN THE GREAT RECESSION I THINK THE AMOUNT THAT WE GOT. IN CALIFORNIA WAS MANY TIMES MORE THAN THIS AND THE SEVERITY OF THIS MAY BE EQUAL OR GREATER TO. WHAT WE SAW- A DECADE AGO SO THAT MONEY MAY BE JUST BE USED TO KEEP THE DISTRICTS HALL BECAUSE THE RIGHT NOW THE NUMBERS WERE HEARING FROM- PROJECTIONS ARE HEARD YESTERDAY FROM THE LA- DEAL LAUGH. COULD BE THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE WITH THAT. LACK OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OUT THERE IS WE HAVE TO BE. BE MINDFUL OF THAT- SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE FOLLOW UP TO SOMEONE MEMBER LIMóN QUESTION RIGHT NOW. IS THAT. THEY DISTRICTS- THIS IS A REALITY CHECK TIME FOR THEM RIGHT NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE PLANNING FOR THE SUMMER AND THE FALL. AND MANY TIMES THEY ONE WAY MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE OFFERING RIGHT NOW. SO OF COURSE THAT THAT THE PIECES THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO FILL THE GAP. OUR ONE TEN MONEY WE HAVE IN THE RESERVE- ANY FEDERAL MONEY WE ALREADY GOT OR WE COULD GET INTO THE NEXT ROUND FROM FROM FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO AS FAR AS- DEFERRALS OR- YOU KNOW PRIOR TOOLS THAT WE USE BECAUSE- THE NUMBER ONE THING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS HOW DO WE- GET OUT OF THIS ALIVE. AND NOT CUT OUR SCHOOLS. NOT CUT OUR KIDS I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE GOAL. THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IN ADDITION TO OF COURSE BEING HEALTHY CALIFORNIA DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT HOW DO WE- HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO OUR KIDS AND OUR SCHOOLS. SO WHAT WHAT ARE WE THINKING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS THERE THE REALITY CHECK AS FAR AS- WE KNOW MORE MONEY. FOR EDUCATION AND GET ON TOP OF JANUARY THAT'S NOT IN THE CARDS. BUT ARE WE REALISTIC THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE. A STATUS QUO- AT NO- NO NET LOSS I KNOW THAT THAT WAS THE GOAL WHEN WE VOTED. IN MARCH WHEN WE WHEN WE WHEN RECESS WAS TO HAVE. A HOLD HARMLESS TO DO WE DO WE THINK THAT'S REALISTIC AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN CAN HAVE- THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY'LL BE NO- NEGATIVE. ACTINS FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE RELATE TO SCHOOL FUNDING. YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND RECORDED WITH THE JUST CALM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND SO WE ARE STILL WORKING ON BUILDING THE NAY REVISION- AND GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT OUR REVENUES ARE GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD- HOWEVER A COUPLE OF THINGS. NOTE AT JENNY AT THE JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE WERE- PROJECTING A PATH ONE IN OUR- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE LEVEL WHICH IS VERY SENSITIVE TO REVENUES- SO IMPACT REVENUES ARE VERY LIKELY TO- IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PENDING AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL- BUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND- I CAN'T SPEAK. TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PRIOR RECESSION- AS AS YOU NOTED- YOU KNOW THAT THIS ECONOMIC IMPACT COULD LOOK SIMILAR TO THAT AND- THERE THERE WERE MANY DIFFERENT- OPTIONS THAT WE ADOPTED IN ORDER TO. MITIGATE THE IMPACT TO SCHOOL- AND THAT INCLUDES DEFERRED BANQUET DEFERRAL ON USE OF ONE TIME FUN- BUT IN THE LAST. RECESSION WE ALSO- DID AT AT LOOK AT PRODUCTION AND BASS- APPORTIONMENT. SO YOU KNOW IF IT IT'S HARD PROJECT EXACTLY GOING TO LOOK LIKE IT IS BUT BECAUSE- THEY SAID WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE NAY REVISION BUT- THERE THERE ARE SOME INDICATORS THERE THAT. THERE MAY BE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE MOVING FORWARD. AND DID LA WANT TO. WEIGH IN ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL. I'M SURE- I WOULD JUST SAY A BIG THE LEGISLATURE DID TAKE A VARIETY OF ACTIONS LAST TIME TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE- SO THAT IT WASN'T JUST SPECIFICALLY CUTS THE VOTE I BELIEVE MY UNDERSTANDING IS I THINK THE CUTS WERE ABOUT. 9% CUTS TO GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING AOUT 20% CUTS TO CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS WHEN WE DID RELY SIGNIFICANTLY OF THE STATE ON PATROLS IN THE- IN THE PREVIOUS ARE RECESSION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- IS WHAT IS ONE WAY TO HELP AVOID A SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVING TO MAKE CUTS- BUT THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY WITH WITH DEFERRALS IS IT. THERE'S A PARTICULAR THINGS THEN YOU HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST IS THAT- IT DOES CREATE CASH FLOW BURDENS FOR DISTRICTS SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN'T ADDRESS WAS CAST FOR NEITHER. IT COMPLAINTS BECOME A CUT I THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY- CHALLENGING FOR A SCHOOL A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT WHEN YOU DO IT THE FOR ALL YOUR SORT OF A. OF COUNTING ON. THINGS GETTING BETTER AND YOU'RE KIND OF. THE NEED FOR THE- BUT IF WE DO HAVE US THE STATE AND- RECESSION ANALYTICS MULTIPLE YEARS THAT CAN SOMETIMES THE NEED TO. CUT THEM A FUTURE IF WE DON'T. IF WE DON'T. HAVE AN INCREASE IN REVENUES. WHEN THE STATE DID THE PATROLS LAST TIME WE- YOU KNOW THAT WE IMPLEMENTED- ESSENTIAL NUMBER OF DEFERRALS- AND THEN- THEY- COMING. OUT OF THE STORE TO RECOVER AND THEN PROP THIRTY WAS PASSED AND THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE WAS ABLE TO PEOPLE'S DOWN AND- AVOID SOME OF THOSE REDUCTIONS. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT THE STATE DID A LOT OF- IT IT WAS- TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY ON. CATEGORICAL PROGRAM RESERVES- I BELIEVE THAT. WE HAVE AT SOME POINT IT WAS MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS IN CATEGORICAL RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN- IN DISTRICTS ARE RESERVES AND WE SAID FOR THE- PRINTER. THAT RECESSION PERIOD WE SAID. YOU CAN USE IT FOR ANY PURPOSE AND SO DISTRICTS RELY ON THAT TO. MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE CUTS. I'M WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE- AS OUR HELPFUL THIS TIME AROUND BECAUSE THE LCI FIVE. ARE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CLEANING UP THE FIVE WE LIVE IN A LOT OF THESE KIND OF LOCAL PROGRAM SO. WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT THAT THAT ARE AVAILABLE BUT WE DON'T EXPECT THAT'S GOING TO BE AS- AS- ACOSTA MUSIC. THAT WAS IN THE PAST. SO IN SAM HE DO WE THINK THAT WE BE ABLE TO TELL I KNOW TODAY'S. LATE APRIL WE HAVEN'T. HAD A CHANCE TO RECEIVE THE MAY REVISE AND EVALUATING GRAND THE ME REVISED IS. KIND OF I GUESS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE REVENUES IN BUT WE HAVE A GENERAL ASSUMPTION BUT- BUT DO WE THINK THAT WE COULD TELL. SCHOOL THAT THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT OBVIOUS IS GIVE ME A DIFFICULT BUDGET BUT THIS WOULD BE A BUDGET UP A STATUS QUO OR WOULD WE EXPECTED WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE- AT A REDUCTION IN THE NEGATIVE WHEN WE ADOPT OUR- OUR- TWENTY- TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. YEAH I WITH IT AGAIN I THINK WE STILL DON'T- OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW THAT. WE WITH A COUPLE THING WE THINK THAT. WE CAN AVOID THOSE THOSE CUTS ARE THE GUY THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE IN AN IMPORTANT I THINK CONSIDERATION IN PASSING THAT JIM BUDGET- I THINK THERE. THE AYE THE IDEA IS THAT WE NEED TO PASSAGE YOU BUDGET OF CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED. AND THEN IF THIRTY TWO CHANGES MAYBE THAT WOULD COME IN LATER. THE LONGER WE WAIT TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE FOR DISTRICTS AND SO THE FACT THAT. IT'S THERE I THINK EVERY YEAR ESTIMATING REVENUES IS DIFFICULT- IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION IT'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING- BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE IN THE APRIL TAX PAYMENTS. ARE ABLE TAX FILING DEADLINE AND JUST SO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY WITH GROUND ECONOMY. IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TO SEND OF THESE CLEAR SIGNALS AND- BUT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. WITH BUDGET. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU DO SAY FOR EXAMPLE- TRY TO AVOID SOME OF THE INITIAL CUTS FOR A- NINETY CUTS IN THE IN THE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR- AND THE SITUATION DOES GET WORSE THAT DOES. DOES REQUIRE BIGGER CA ON THE LINE. BUT IT. MIGHT BE. THAT YOU. WANT TO PRESERVE. IT'LL IT'LL BE CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF FIGURE THAT OUT SO I THINK. I'M FORTUNATE WE DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO REALLY SAY. FIRST CORD YES THIS IS THE SORT OF MAGNITUDE OF THE OF THE FISCAL IMPACT THAT WE WOULD SEE. THANK YOU THE NEXT WILL HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC SAID SHE AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. MR MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I APPRECIATED TO THE LAST LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM- THE CHAIRMAN AND THE RESPONSES FROM. THE LA- AND THAT- IT REMINDS ME OF MY EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- WITH THE TAURUS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT A DISTRICT WITH ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND IN ENROLLMENT. SMALLER THAN A URBAN DISTRICTS BUT- ABOUT MEDIUM SIZE IN TERMS OF OUR SUBURBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- I KNOW THAT- A LOT OF WHATTHE LA- DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF. THE FLEXIBILITY- AND THE DEFERRALS REALLY MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN ALLOWING LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO- IN A BALANCED THE BUDGET AND KEEP- OUR SCHOOLS RUNNING SO I- I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING THEME THAT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO EMPHASIZE- THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY FOR- FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO. MOVE MONIES AROUND- THEY THEY KNOW. WHERE THEIR NEEDS ARE THE GREATEST AND SO WE SHOULD- YOU KNOW TRULY FALL THE SPIRIT A PERHAPS REDEDICATE OURSELVES TO THE SPIRIT OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE MAXIMUM. FLEXIBILITY TO- ALLOCATE THE DOLLARS- TO WHERE THE NEEDS ARE THE GREATEST- I WANTED TO FOLLOW ON THE CHAIR IS LINE OF QUESTIONING AND REFERRED TO. A JOINT LETTER ALL OF THE- SIX MAJOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALONG THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SAN DIEGO UNIFIED LONG BEACH UNIFIED. SACRAMENTO UNIFIED. AS WELL AS A KRONE NORCO UNIFIED- AND I WANTED TO- ASK. MORE SPECIFICALLY ON ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED IN THIS LETTER THAT. MAY DRAW THE SAME RESPONSES THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING- THAT THAT IS TOO EARLY TO PROJECT REVENUES AND THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE AN BUT- I KNOW I KNOW FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DID THAT THE TO CONSISTENT ASKS THAT WE HEAR ARE- THE COLA THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND PENSION RELIEF. SO I WANTED TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- FIRST. YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED THIS BUT I WANTED TO- HERE ARE YOU KNOW- MORE SPECIFIC RESPONSE WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING. YOU KNOW- A COLA- GUN FOR THIS UPCOMING MAY REVISE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AGAIN- I YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT WE'RE STILL ASSESSING THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT WE ARE WILL HAVE AVAILABLE- WE RECEIVE THE SAME LETTER AND ARE AWARE OF THE CONCERNS AS MANY OF THE DISTRICTS REGARDING AND WEATHER NOT COLD WILL BE- PROVIDED AND WHETHER OR NOT- YOU KNOW. THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. ANDASSISTANCE WITH A PENSION RELIEF- SO WE ARE CERTAINLY AWARE OF THOSE CONCERNS AND ARE ARE JUST DISCUSSING WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE SO. FORTUNATELY I CAN'T PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE CLARITY AT THIS TIME BUT LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING ALL THESE ISSUES- WHEN WE RELEASED MERITAGE AND- THANK YOU SO- I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP A TEAR RESPONSE BY AGAIN RFERRING TO THIS LETTER WHERE THEY- REFERRED TO THE PERHAPS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- THE BUSES SITUATION THAT WE'RE FACING NOW- VERSUS WHAT WE FACED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- WITH THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH IS THE- A COMBINED TWENTY BILLION- AND- ASSORTED RESERVE FUNDS THAT STATE A CALIFORNIA THAT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO- SAVE YOU KNOW. STOCK AWAY UGH YOU KNOW FOR THE RAINY DAY WE KNOW THAT THE RAINY DAYS IS HERE AND NOW AND SO THIS LETTER RECALL REFERS TO A DECLARATION OF A BUDGET EMERGENCY TO USE THE STATE'S BUDGET STABILIZATION FUND- TO FUND A COLA ABOVE THE STATURE LEVEL. CAN YOU COMMENT- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON. WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT WE CAN DRAW UPON A FROM OUR RESERVES IN ORDER TO TRY TO- TO- IF NOT- FUND A COLA TO AT LEAST ALLEVIATE THE BUDGET CUTS THAT WE MAY BE FACING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION. AGAIN WE SAYS THIS IS THE NOW THAT THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING ON AVAILABLE RESOURCES REALLY ESSENTIAL CRAFT UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DRAWN DOWN IN TERMS OF- ANY KIND OF RESERVES THE AND I TRULY DON'T WANT TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR AND- AN ART DIRECTOR ON ONLIKE- IS THE PLAN FOR THE- SIGNS AND I KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO ENGAGING. I'M WITH YOU ALL ON ON THE PROPER USE THEIR POTENTIAL FOR A CONSUMER TO BE DECLARATION- WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT- WE DO HAVE A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RAINY DAY FUND. WITH THE BALLOT SAYS- CURRENTLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION AND THAT- CERTAINLY- WILL BE RECALCULATED AND THE COUNTRY BECOMING AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT- EXPENDITURES FOR. OUR SCHOOLS AND IN THE EVENT THAT- THE EXPANDED AT THE AT THE FORMULA LOT THE TAXES THAT FUND WHICH E BELIEVE THAT WELL SO- THERE ARE FUNDS AVAILABLE ON ON IN A PROPAGATE RAINY DAY FUND- IN TERMS OF THE LARGER ALBEIT SAY ANOTHER. MEETING FUNDS FOR THE STATE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING. A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ALL. THE NAME. ALL RIGHT OUT MOVING ON THEN TO THE IS OF PENSION THE SIGNERS OF THIS- LETTER REQUEST A STATE FREEZE TO BE EXISTING EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES- AS FOR- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CONTRIBUTIONS TO- CAL STIRRERS AND CALPERS- WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS POSITION ON THIS REQUEST. SO WE ARE AND WE'RE LIKE NO CUTE WE AWARE AS THE INCREASING COST TO YOU AND WE'LL DISTRICT OF PENSIONS- AND BASED ON THAT THE CLAIMS THAT WERE PUT I PLACE SEVERAL YEARS AGO- AND WE RECEIVED LETTERS ABOUT THAT- YOU KNOW WERE AGAIN AFFECTING WHERE WE'RE AT- AND THAT LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE PICTURE HOLISTICALLY THE ECONOMIC PICTURE OF THE BUDGET- AND- AGAIN YOU KNOW. LOOKING FOR Q. Q. ENGAGING WITH YOU ON THAT IN THE NAY REVISION I THINK WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OTHER- COSTS THAT AND WE'LL DISTRICTS HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE- YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY WRITING COSTLY TO SPECIAL EDUCATION WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET- BACK IN JANUARY- REGARDING SPECIAL EDUCATION WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE THINGS- AND ASSESSING WHEN WE'RE EXPECTING THE FISCAL. SURE FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND. IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME. ALL RIGHT LAST NOT I. WANT TO A AGAIN REFER BACK TO MY EXPERIENCE AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WHEN WE- WERE- HAVING TO- DEAL WITH THE STATE BUDGET CUTS. I WANTED TO IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT THERE ARE OUR CURRENT SYSTEM STILL REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT THEIR FINAL A SCHOOL YOUR BUDGET FOR THE FOR THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR BY THE END OF JUNE AND A GIVEN THAT WE ARE NOW DEALING WITH THIS REALITY OF- OF A- SPECULATIVE MAY REVISE AND A MORE- REALISTIC. AUGUST REVISE BASED ON THE REVENUE FIGURES THAT WILL BE GETTING- IN JULY AND AUGUST. HOW OURS WHAT IS THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES- PLANS IN TERMS OF GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN ADOPTING THEIR- FINAL SCORE YOUR BUDGETS GIVEN THAT- TO MY UNDERSTANDING THERE ARE STILL REQUIRED TO ADOPT THEIR FINAL- SCHOOL YEAR BUDGETS IN JUNE WHEREAS THERE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE- MORE REALISTIC NUMBERS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR BUDGET IS GOING TO BE LOOKING LIKE UNTIL AUGUST. CERTAINLY YOU AND YOU ARE CORRECT AND WILL DISTRICT ARE REQUIRED KID UP THEIR BUDGET BY THE END OF JUNE- TOOK NOTICE I WOULD NOT A COUPLE OF THINGS- ONE THAT- SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO UPDATE THEIR BUDGET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR- AT THAT TRULY DEFINE PEERING IT- SO THAT IS CURRENTLY ALREADY BUILT. INTO INTO OUR SYSTEM AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD KNOW IS THAT AND THE GOVERNOR DID RECENTLY PUT OUT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER- IN REGARDS TO LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN- WHICH ARE AND AS YOU KNOW VERY CLOSELY TIED TO THE BUDGET PROVIDING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH FLEXIBILITY- AN EXTENSION ON- THAT BRING TOGETHER THOSE FULL PLANS UNTIL THE FALL- WE ARE LOOKING AT POSSIBILITIES AROUND THAT- AND GET RECOGNIZING THAT YOU'RE THERE WE CURRENTLY DO HAVE PROPERTIES IN PLACE. FOR INTERIM LOOKS AT AT SCHOOL BUT- AND- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE THIS FALL FOR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS AT THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW. DIFFICULT ECONOMIC DECISION. THANK YOU ARE. I WANT TO MAKE MY LAST QUESTION- FOR NOW- TO FOLLOW UP ON THE LA OWES. DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW DEFERRALS WHO WERE- VERY IMPORTANT IN- ALLOWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS- DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHAT IS THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES POSITION- AS IT RELATES TO- THE DEFERRALS. THAT WERE USED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION TO ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADDRESS THEIR CASH FLOW ISSUES. I'M SORRY I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND- ARE YOU ASKING FOR WHAT OUR OPINION LET THOSE THOSE DEFERRALS THAT WERE USED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. YES AND THE TO WHAT EXTENT- THOSE. ARE DEFERRALS ARE BEING CONSIDERED- TO. ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO DO WHAT THE CURRENT REALITY- OF OUR A- PANDEMIC INDUCED BUDGET CRISIS. YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION ON GO AGAIN AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ARE YOU KNOW VERY AWARE OF THE DIFFERENT- OPTIONS THAT WERE CONSIDERED AND PUT INTO PLACE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WE'RE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT- ALL OF THOSE- AS MEDICAL PROBLEM ENGINE BEFORE AND THE FLEXIBILITY- ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO US BECAUSE- OF THE ADOPTION OF THE ACT THAT- HOWEVER WE'RE TRYING TO BE VERY- A HOLISTIC APPROACH IN TERMS THAT CONSIDERING ALL AVAILABLE OPTIONS BUT AGAIN WELL NO BETTER IN TWO WEEKS- WHAT- WHAT DIFFERENT OPTIONS MAKE MONTH THAN AND LOOK FOR TO PREVENT CONNECT TO YOUR WALLET IN THE VISION. OKAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GROW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS FOR FINANCE WERE WERE ASKED WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE MEMBER VISION- I TOO AM INTERESTED IN- IF YOU. THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE ON AUGUST FOR VISION WHICH WHICH I SEEM LIKELY BECAUSE WE WON'T OTHER REVENUES UNTIL. JULY FIFTEEN SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO- LOOK AT THE REVENUES JULY FIFTEENTH AND- AND MAYBE MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN AUGUST BUT- A QUESTION FOR- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO WE MOVE QUICKLY AND- I GAVE YOU A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR PP AND CLEANING SCHOOLS CAN YOU- CAN YOU OUTLINE. WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THAT MONEY- CONTRACTS PURCHASES DISTRIBUTION CLEANING- WHETHER THE MONEY WAS SUFFICIENT OR- IN EXCESS OF WHAT YOU NEEDED BUT- IF YOU JUST OUTLINED YOUR ACTIONS FOR ME APPRECIATE IT. I APOLOGIZE IS A CD- COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION PLEASE. YET YEAH WE OF THE LEGISLATURE OF MOVE QUICKLY AND- AUTHORIZE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FEE TO GET PPVS AND CLEAN SCHOOLS AND- I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOU ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN CONTRACTS DISTRIBUTION. OF DELIVERY- CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME- THE UPDATE ON THE PROCESS AND WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING WITH THAT. THIS IS THE LOWEST BIDDER EDUCATION I'M THOSE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED TALLY A IS. THREE WEEKS AGO- AND ELEAZAR BEING ASKED TO USE THEM BASED ON. THESE ARE TIMES THAT WORK ON BY ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE AND SO ON SHELLY IS GOING TO GET A TERMINATION ON HOW THEY GO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA SPECIFICALLY ON AND THE APPROACH ALLERGIES ARE TAKING AND HOW THEY'RE GONNA SPEND US BEYOND ELIGIBLE USES. THAT WORD AND- QUESTION LETTER. SO THERE BE ANY. THE ANY REPORTING BACK OF SOLELY UP TO THEIR DISCRETION. IT'S ONLY UP TO THEIR DISCRETION THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT LEGISLATION THAT WE REQUIRE WORK ONLY ACE OKAY ARE YOU GETTING IT ARE YOU GETTING ANY INDICATION THAT THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY AND ACQUIRING PPVS OR- OR- CLEANING THE FACILITIES IN GETTING PRODUCTS THINGS LIKE THAT. IN TERMS OF PP WE DO HAVE A STATE OR CALL THAT WE HAVE WEEKLY WITH OUR IT COALITION GROUPS AND OUR LABOR MANAGEMENT GROUPS AND WE ARE HEARING FROM THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS. ACTUALLY ACQUIRING- EP EQUIPMENT SO E ARE ACTUALLY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH CALLAWAY ASKS AND WE HAVE CREATED KIND OF AN INTERNAL WORKGROUP. ON HOW BEST TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING PP TO THE SCHOOLS THAT YET SO WE ARE WORKING ON THAT INTERNALLY HERE. OKAY GREAT IF YOU COULD GIVE THAT THE COMMITTEE POSTED ON THAT- AFTER A CALL I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANKS SO MUCH. YES OKAY THANK YOU MISTER BROWN I KNOW MR GALLAGHER ASK QUESTIONS BE STEPPED OUT I HAVE A FEW AND THEN WE'LL GET TO THAT CHAIRMAN TING HAS A FEW QUESTIONS BUT FOLLOWING UP ON THIS PP E. QUESTION IS ONE OF MY ISSUES ON MY NOTES HERE BUT ALSO I WILL NOTE THAT WE GOT A TEXAS NOW FOR MAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA BACK IN RIVERSIDE HE'S- WATCHING US LIVE OUT THERE ANY ONLY MAKE SURE THAT WE ASK THIS QUESTION- WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF- CLASSIFIED EMPLOYED SPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ARE WORKING RIGHT NOW ON MEALS THAT DON'T HAVE PROPER EQUIPMENT. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES IS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THE BILLS AND IF THEY HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ON THIS P. P. THIS MONEY THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE FIRST PLACE SO WE ARE AS WE TALKED ABOUT. THE LAST HEARING. HAVE THIS MAJOR BILLION DOLLAR ORDER- THAT'S IN THE- PIPELINE SO. THE QUESTION IS ARE ARE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FRANKLY THE NEXT ANEL AS WELL IN THE AFTERNOON. OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND FACILITIES ARE THEY GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE TO TAP INTO THIS- PP FOR THEIR NEEDS. A HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AT I CERTAINLY CITY- FOR FREE TO THE ADS- ON ANYTHING I'M ABOUT TO SAY THAT- YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THE PROCESS AND IS THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT PP IS NOT A BILL. WILL CAN'T ACT OF PP ON THEIR OWN- THERE IS A PROCESS AND THROUGH THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS THAT THEM FOR SCHOOL TO REQUEST ASSISTANCE WITH PP- FROM THEIR CITY AND WORK COUNTY- AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT- THEIR UNSUCCESSFUL WIHOUT THEY CAN WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE STATE- AND I. DEFERREDTO FEED TO PROVIDE ANY MORE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR HOW I'M DISTRICT HAVE BEEN WORKING- THROUGH THEN- WITH CAL- YES JACKET PP. OKAY BEFORE YES. GO AHEAD. SORRY I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD THAT- JUNE TWO WHAT JESSICA WAS SAYING THAT THAT PROCESS IS CORRECT- WE'RE JUST STARTING TO HEAR MORE AND MORE AS AS I MENTIONED A LITTLE EARLIER AROUND THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT BEING ABLE TO GET TO ACCESS PP SO WE HAVE REACHED OUT THE SUPERINTENDENT REACHED OUT JUST THIS LAST WEEK TO CALLAWAY US DIRECTLY SO THAT WE CAN START A DIRECT LINE I'M TO DETERMINE WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE AND HOW WE CAN BEST I'M PROVIDE THOSE CERTAIN BED THE NEEDED EQUIPMENT TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. OKAY I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION IS LET'S USE MY DISTRICT HERE AS AN EXAMPLE AT SAKS CITY- THEY'RE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES THROUGH SO YOU TEND TO WONDER OUT THERE WORKING HARD GIVING OUT. TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MEALS THE NUMBERS ARE JUST STAGGERING. AND THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THEY DON'T HAVE. PROPER MASK NORTH FACE SHIELDS AND NOW THEY'RE PURCHASING THEM BUT THE DISTRICT DON'T HAVE THE MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO I GUESS THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BITE BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT THE ISSUE THE QUESTION IS. YOU KNOW CHAIRMAN TEAM WE HAD A BIG HEARING A WEEK AGO ABOUT THAT BILLION DOLLAR ORDER. THAT'S COMING FOR PP ACROSS THE STATE SO WE'LL DISTRICTS GET THAT. CHANCE TO JUST GET IT WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FOR IT AND THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE. THAT DISTRICTS CARE ABOUT IS CAN THEY ACQUIRE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE TO DIP INTO THEIR OWN. RESOURCES TO PAY THE BILL FOR THAT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO AGAIN I AS DEFERREDSAID THAT THE PROCESS THAT I OUTLINED BEFORE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY THEY CAN CERTAINLY- WORK THROUGH- THEIR COUNTIES OR AT THE STATE- YES- IN TERMS OF THE COST OF THOSE- I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON- YOU KNOW WHO THAT THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION AB RIGHT NOW. YEAH THAT'S THE ISSUE I GET A FOLLOW UP WITH OUR SUPERINTENDENT AND THEY SAID THAT BE GREAT TO GET IT BUT DO WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THAT. REALLY IS THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW I WANT TO MOVE ON TO ANOTHER- ISSUE. AND WE'RE GONNA GET MORE INTO THIS IN THE NEXT PANEL BUT WHILE WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW. OF COURSE I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT MAY REVISE YOU DON'T HAVE BEFORE US THERE ARE SO MANY. QUESTIONS NOT ENOUGH ANSWERS RIGHT NOW. THE ONE THING THAT WE REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS IS THIS. THE LEARNING LAS ISSUE WHICH WE'RE GONNA GET IN GREAT DETAIL THE NEXT PANEL. AND JUST WANTED TO PROBE THE INTERESTING ARC. AS I SAID EARLIER OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO KEEP DISTRICTS HOLD TO NOT MAKE CUTS WE ADOPT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- IN ADDITION. I THINK THAT WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS THE EQUITY ISSUE AND THE- ISSUES WE HAVE WILL GO A LEARNING LOST SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THE ASSEMBLY IS LOOKING AT MAKING A TOP PRIORITY TO HAVE A ONE TIME- BLOCK GRANT AVAILABLE TO DISTRICTS FOCUSING ON LEARNING LAS WHETHER IT'S- SUMMER SCHOOL OR SUMMER BRIDGE. OR OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES- TO FOCUS ON OUR KIDS THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER POTENTIALLY THE FALL TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE- THEY'RE THEY'RE UP TO SPEED WHEN THEY GET GET BACK AT SCHOOL. SOME MAY SAY WILL SCHOOLS MAY NOT BE OPEN WELL WE CAN CERTAINLY DO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW AND FOCUS ON ON DISTANT STAR BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT. THE GAP IS REAL AND IT'S IS GONNA EXASPERATING SO MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT IT ON THE TABLE- OURS PARK TO SEND SIGNAL TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AT THIS. THING THAT AS A ALREADY STUDENTS. THANKS FOR IT ALREADY A NOTE. YESTERDAY I THINK. DISTRICT THEY'D LIKE TO DO OTHER PROGRAM BUT WHEN MAKE SURE THAT WE THE OP. TO PLANT WORD. AND PUT. BUT REPURPOSE THEM OF OUR ONE TIME. MONIES FOR THIS PURPOSE SO- I KNOW I'VE SPOKE GOVERNOR PERSONALLY ABOUT THIS BUT I JUST WANTED TO. ASK GOD TO. FINANCE YOU HAD INTEREST. THAT AND ARE AT LINDA DOCUMENT DEALING HIM AND I KNOW THAT ON THE NEXT PANEL- AND CAN PROVIDE A LOT OF. MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THAT BUT- I WE ARE CERTAINLY AWARE THAT AND WE'RE WORKING- WITH OUR PARTNERS A PART. OF EDUCATION PART OF EDUCATION. ON IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THAT LEARNING HAD THEN- AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MITIGATE IT- BUT AGAIN. YOU KNOW. I THINK THEY WERE AWARE OF IT- BUT WE- CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO ANY POTENTIAL. I'M A FUNDS AVAILABILITY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT INTO THE KITCHEN THE REVISION. FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH AND THEN- LASTLY I KNOW THAT TODAY THE GOVERNOR AT NOON APPARENTLY IS GOING TO- ANNOUNCED SOME AN UPDATE TO THE STAY AT HOME ORDER RELATE TO SCHOOLS. AND WHAT WE COULD EXPECT IF SCHOOLS DO REOPEN FOCUSING ON SAFETY AND PREPARATION- YOU KNOW THE PLACE BASED ACTIVITY WAS SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE CENTERS- WORKSTATIONS- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT. YOU WANT TO ADD MAY BE NOW OR MAYBE AFTERNOON WHEN YOU WE WOULD COME BACK YOU CAN YOU CAN ELABORATE ON THAT THAT MAY BE HELPFUL AS WELL. CERTAINLY THANK YOU AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO SELL THE GOVERNOR SANDERS SO I WILL- FIT MY COMMENTS FOR AFTER THAT OKAY HI BUT THIS MAY. PUT YOU ON A LITTLE TIME OUT IT WILL COME BACK IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF AND SEE IF YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US THERE- GET. OKAY AND THEN- AND WE'RE WAITING FOR US TOGETHER TO COME BACK. ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING HAD SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL. TERMINATING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST GOING TO LA- WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DEFERRALS AS A TOOL TO- YES STAVE OFF BUDGET CUTS TO THE OTHER TOOLS THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND US LOOKING OUT AS WE- ACTUALLY HAVE TO COME CONTEMPLATE. CUTS. THE BANK CAN JUST WALKING THROUGH SOME OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT ARE- TOOK THE FOR ALL THIS IS ONE OF THEM THAT YOU CAN DO- TRYING TO FIND PLACES WHERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE- BUT CHANGE THE LAW TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST AS WELL. IT WAS ALSO KIND OF HAVE THEIR OWN ISSUES- AND OFTENTIMES THE COMES THAT AT SOME TRADE OFFS BUT IT DOES PROVIDE DISTRICTS MORE FLEXIBILITY TO. CHOOSE HOW TO HOW TO MAKE THOSE CUTS SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE THING THAT. THEY DID IT DURING THE MIDST OF THE RECESSION IS TO ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO REDUCE THE SCHOOL YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DAYS- AND- AND THAT. THEY DID THAT AND MAYBE. REDUCTIONS TO SALARY TO THE RESULT. THAT WERE FURLOUGHED- BUT IT SO IT BECOMES ITS OWN CHALLENGE- BUT THAT IS ANOTHER- WAY TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR DISTRICTS IN TERMS OF SOME SPECIFIC RULES AND- ARM AND- I'M- OBVIOUSLY. THE ANOTHER BIG QUESTION WILL BE THAT. AND I WAS TRICKS TO FINANCES OR TO WHAT EXTENT. DO WE THINK THERE IS. ACTUALLY FUNDING FOR. BY THE SCHOOL THE ON THE MINIMUM COUNTY. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT. WILL BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION TO. THINK ABOUT WHAT OTHER- BLAZER. MIGHT EXIST- BUT I THINK THE DEFERRALS IN THE TRYING TO- FREE UP ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR IT'S KIND OF THE FIRST. IS THAT. WE THINK IS GONNA PASS AND I TO PUT. THAT. FOR THE THAT. CAN BE SOME ADDITIONAL. OPS ADAM. OF LIKE THE BIG. WE GOT A SENSE TO NOT TO LA HEAVY GOT THE SAN. THAT IT WILL BE A HAVE STARTED TO QATAR CUTS. IN ALL THE- WE'VE HAD WITH THEM THEY SEEM TO KEEP. TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE MONEY THEY MIGHT BE GETTING FROM THE STATE SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE NOT- THEY'RE NOT FULLY. SORT OF IN TUNE WITH THE BUDGET SITUATION. YEAH I AM WE HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS- DIES YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE- DIFFICULT TO SET UP THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE FOLKS I DO THINK THAT. IN OUR CONVERSATIONS THERE'D BEEN SOME UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW OUR REVENUES ARE NOT GONNA BE LIKE WHAT THEY WERE IN THE AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHAT I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN- IS TOTALLY CLEAR IS SORT OF THE EXPECTATIONS AROUND WORKS OF POPCORN WE'RE GOING TO GO AND I THINK IT'S- OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S BUT I THINK IT'S- EVERYONE STRUGGLING IN OUR DUTY AS ARE MEMBERS OF THE COULD ASK- AWESOME FINANCE TO KIND OF PROVIDE SOME GREATER SERBIAN TERMS OF WHAT THE MAGNITUDE. REDUCTION WILL BE I THINK IT IS- VERY DIFFICULT TO SORT OF OUR THE GRAVEL TOOLS WILL BE AND THE SPEED AT WHICH THE SORT OF ECONOMIC SITUATION IS CHANGING VERY FAST- HERE- BUT WAS FASCINATING IN THE PREVIOUS RECESSIONS LOCUSTS. ARE VERY DRASTIC YOU'RE SO I THINK THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE TOWNS THAT THING JUST PIVOTING TO SORT OF WHAT THE NEW EXPECTATIONS ARE CAN BE A CHALLENGE WE DO THINKTHAT ONE OF THEM IMMEDIATE CONCERNS I KNOW THAT IT IN SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT IS JUST SORT OF EITHER GOING TO BE- MANY HERE ACTIONS ARE MAJOR CHANGES SOMETHING MORE IMMEDIATE. LIKE A REDUCTION IN NINETEEN TWENTY OR A DEFERRAL OF THE PAYMENT AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN I'M A KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISTRICTS WOULD LIKE SOMETIME TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT SO THAT THEY HAVE- YOU KNOW THE ABILITY FOR EXAMPLE THIRTY TO GET A DEFERRAL. I HAVE- THE ABILITY TO GO OUT AND BORROW FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE SO FULLER SOME OF THE POSITIONS THAT WE HAD A WE HAVE NOT I'M SORT OF GONE MUCH INTO THE DETAILS. WHAT BUDGET CUTS MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT WHAT- OR- WOULD. TO HAVE. BOASTING THANK YOU ARE JUST TO DIP OF JUST ON THAT SAY. IS HOW IT IN YOUR CAN WITH ELEAZAR DO YOU FEEL THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO COME UP WITH SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AROUND- POTENTIAL BUDGET CUTS I KNOW THAT ALL THE LEGISLATORS HAVE BEGINNING A SLEW OF INCREASE OVER THE LAST- NUMBER WEEKS FROM THEIR VARIOUS LOCAL AND LIAISE. BUT THE CONVERSATION SEEMS TO FOCUS ON WHAT THAT THE CALL WAS COMING AND DID NOT REGARDING POTENTIAL CUTS AND WHETHER THEY ARE PREPARED TO OFFER SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT WHAT TO DO SO. IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON YOUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE WAY IT IS AND THEY'RE FISCAL PREPAREDNESS IN THIS PANDEMIC SITUATION. THIS IS THE SECOND STATUE AGAIN I WOULD SAY THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE HEARING MORE FROM THE COUNTY OFFICES- BECAUSE THEY DO PLAY AN OVERSIGHT ROLE OR THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR HEARING MORE FROM THEM IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES THEY ARE FACING. AND HOW TO ADVISE THEIR LOCAL DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW- SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE- ALSO COMMUNICATING WITH MIKE FINE AND THICK MATS TO TRY AND GET SOME SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF FISCAL TOOLS AND HOW THEY CAN BEST HELP MANAGE IT- BUT UNTIL WE KNOW MORE AROUND- AS WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT TODAY WHAT. MAY REVISE MAY LOOK LIKE- THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF WAITING TO SEE AS WELL AS CHIU TO WEAR HOW THEY CONTINUE TO BUDGET AND MOVE FORWARD. WHAT WHAT ADVICE ARE YOU GIVING THEM ON HOW TO PROCEED. WELL IT WAS SO I'M NOT COUNTY OFFICES ARE ON. HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY UNDER EACH OFF AND RIGHT TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT TO THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SO WE DEFERRED TO THOSE THAT COUNTY OFFICES- AND WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE TO THEM AS THEIR PRICING. BASED OKAY COULD COULD YOUR TO THE QUESTION I JUST ASKED YOU. THE AS IT WAS BUT JUST MENTION WE DON'T WE AS A STATE ENTITY DON'T PROVIDE THAT THE SCHOOL OVERSIGHT SO THE LOCAL COLONEL OPPOSITE PROVIDED TODAY TO THE ALLEY ETS- AT THIS POINT AS- WE DON'T KNOW ANYMORE AS AS JESSICA'S MENTIONED IN TERMS OF. THE FINANCES OF THE STATE WE DON'T KNOW ANY ANY ADDITIONAL STEPS ON HOW TO GUIDE THEM- THE LOCALS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND ARE THE ONES THAT ARE BEST IN THE BEST CONNECTION WITH THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AS TO BUT THE PROVIDING THAT OVERSIGHT. THAT WE PLAY A ROLE MORE IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE DON'T PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF THE SCHOOL OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT TOWN DOT ORG BY USING RIGHT NOW BASICALLY A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT ON THIS CALL- RELATED TO. WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND DEFERRALS THE OTHER FLEXIBILITY- DOES FLEXIBILITY TECH TO COME THROUGH YOU KNOW LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW NO THEY'RE PLANNING FOR DEFERRAL RUNNING DIFFERENT BUDGET SCENARIOS. I'M I'M DIFFERENT MODELS. ON THE GUIDANCE THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING CONTACT ME OFFICE. IN THE TO DO REPORT WE'RE JUST TO PROVIDE ANY OTHER GUIDANCE AROUND THE FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY IS THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THE OUR HOME THEY ARE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF SCENARIOS. INCLUDING CUTS. TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE. YES KELLY OFF ARE IN THEIR TO DO THAT. AND I THINK HEY GET A GIVEN THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL HOUSE WE- GO THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS WE'D LOVE TO HEAR OBVIOUSLY FROM YOUR OFFICES BUT ALSO THE COUNTIES AS TO WHAT WHAT IDEAS THEY HAVE I MEAN YOU JUST HEARD LA- TALK ABOUT POTENTIALLY DEFERRALS AND- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT IDEAS AROUND FLEXIBILITY I THINK THOSE ARE ALL IDEAS TO BE. TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF YOU HAD. OTHER IDEAS TO SHARE THEM- I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE CHALLENGES IS YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE WATCHING THAT THE STATE BUDGET BUT- YOU YOU HAVE MORE INTERACTION ON THE STATE BUDGET AND THEY DO. SO I AS MUCH AS YOU CAN- SORT OF JUST ENCOURAGE THE MEASURE GIVE THEM GUIDANCE I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE FISCAL OVER SURPRISE YOU GIVE THEM GUIDANCE. TO GUIDE THEM TO ENSURE THAT YOU AE- ENCOURAGING THEM TO LOOK AT OPTIMISTIC SCENARIOS BUT ALSO PESSIMISTIC SCENARIOS. TO REALLY HELP- YOU KNOW. HELP TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE SOME GOOD GET A BETTER CASE SCENARIOS BUT ALSO SOME WORST CASE IN OURS TO. HOME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK. BUT MISTER KING I THINK ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND IN OUR CONVERSATION. WITH STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN- TALKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS- WE HAVE WE HAVE ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO JUST THAT TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND TRY TO. HIT PREPARE THEMSELVES CAN BE RELATIVELY FLEXIBLE ON INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. I'M I KNOW THAT- THE EXCELLENT STAFF AT PICK NOT AND- YOU KNOW THE WONDERFUL AND COUNTY UP EDUCATION. CBO GROUP THAT WE SPEAK TO HAVE BEEN TALKING ON TO SCHOOL DISTRICT ABOUT AGAIN. LOOKING AT MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS TRYING TO BE FLEXIBLE I DON'T THE DUSTING OFF THEIR PLAYBOOKS FROM THE PRIOR RECESSION. I'M PATHETICALLY AROUND THINGS LIKE WHETHER OR NOT- BAKING BORROWED FROM UNRESTRICTED FUNDS AND- YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT WHAT FLEXIBILITY TO DATE THEY TAKE AN IN DURING THE RECESSION WHAT ARE THEIR RESERVE LEVELS. YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS I THINK PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE BEEN SHARING- AND THAT WE'VE CERTAINLY BEEN ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO DO AS WELL. IS TO IN IN A DIFFERENT- SOCIAL DISTANCING TIME- AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BE REACHING OUT TO THEIR STAKEHOLDERS AND STARTING A CONVERSATION NOW- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT. RIGHT CONVERSELY THAT HAVE AT A LOW MINUTE IN I THAT THAT PROBABLY. THE BEST THING THAT PUTS YOU CAN RIGHT NOW REALLY WORKING COMMUNICATING MYSTICAL. I THINK THE MOST COMPLETE AND I JUST URGE YOU AS YOU HAVE. CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS TO. REALLY GO DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THE MESSAGES- GETTING THROUGH I MEAN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I GET FED THROUGH MY- MY COLLEAGUES IT SEEMS THAT EVERYBODY IS. STILL ASKING ABOUT POLO AND STILL ASKING ABOUT A IN ORDER. IN NOT LOOKING AT SORT OF LOOMING RECESSION. SCENARIOS WHICH- FRANKLY THEY SHOULD BE NOT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. SO I WOULD JUST. ON BOTH DO. MISS HOMES AS WELL AS PART THAT. TO JUST. MAKE SURE YOU ARE SURE THAT MAY. WITH ALL THE THEIR COUNTY OFFICES ALL DALY ETS. COULD THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I DON'T THINK THE MESSAGES KOPPEL GETTING THROUGH AT THIS POINT. GO BACK TO DEPARTMENT ADD- I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN THIS- DURING THIS PANDEMIC IS NOT OPTIMAL AYE AYE I LIKE MANY OF THE- MEMBERS UP HERE HAVE CHILDREN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ARE WE KNOW THAT THEIR ELEAZAR THE TEACHERS ARE REALLY TRYING THEIR BEST TO. EDUCATE THE CHILDREN DURING THIS VERY VERY CHALLENGING TIME AND WE I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT'S JUST NOT UNDER THE MOST OPTIMUM OF CONDITIONS. SO CURRENT SO KIND OF GIVEN THAT. SINCE HOW HOW DO YOU ENSURE. YOU KNOW A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT. MAKING AN OVERLY ABOUT BEING BEING COUNTING YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY. HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE EQUITY GAP YOU KNOW COMPETE EVEN IF COMPUTERS. MY UNDERSTAND IS EVEN DALY UNIFIED GIVE COMPUTERS ARE BEING GIVEN OUT AND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN LOGGED ON TO. YOU KNOW SO I MEAN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS SO YOU HAVE SITUATIONS LIKE THAT. YOUR SITUATIONS WHERE. THERE IS A- NOT A STANDARD IN TERMS OF. HOW MANY. ZOOM CLASSROOM HOURS EVERY TEACHER SUPPOSED TO BE DOING UNLIKE YOU KNOW UNLIKE- CLASSROOM HOURS WOULD THERE'S A STANDARD HOUSE HOW DO YOU. START TO REALLY GET YOUR HANDS AROUND DEVELOPING SOME BROADER STANDARDS OF THE SITUATION THAT WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT MORE- FOR THE NEXT PANEL BUT HOW BUT HOW DO YOU COME TO GET YOUR HANDS AROUND THIS. ON JUST TO ENSURE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTABILITY BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH A VERY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. DO WE LIST. YOU WOMEN FINANCE NO NO THIS DEPARTMENT THAT AREN'T BAD. NO WE'RE WE'RE HERE SORRY AND REACH YOU CUT OUT A LITTLE BIT CAN YOU REPEAT THAT LAST PART OF THE QUESTION PLEASE SURE ABSOLUTELY ON THE JUST JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE I'M CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT IDEAL- THAT WE DO HAVE- MUCH TALKED ABOUT EQUITY GAPS EVEN IF. CHILDREN ARE GETTING COMPUTERS MANY OF THEM ARE NOT EVEN LOGGING ON BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEIR HOUSEHOLD ENVIRONMENT IS- KNOWING THAT WE DON'T HAVE. SET STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS SOME TEACH THREE HOURS OF CLASS ON ZOOM SOME TEACH YOU KNOW HALF AN HOUR OF ZOOM CLASSES OR- WHATEVER HOW HOW DO WE- WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF JUST. DEVELOPING SOME SENSE OF BROAD STANDARDIZATION JUST KNOWING THAT AGAIN THIS IS. JUST OF THE ADEQUATE ABOUT THIS TIME PERIOD WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ISN'T THIS IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY. IT'S JUST NOT IDEA FOR ANYBODY IT AND GOING TO THE TEACHERS ARE WORKING VERY HARD SO WE'RE NOT. CAST IN ANY BLAME BUT I THINK IT'S IN ORDER TO TALK ABOUT LATER BUT- JUST HOW HOW ARE YOU DEVELOPING GUIDANCE. TO ALL THE COUNTY OFFICES AND- YOU KNOW TO GIVE TO THEIR DISTRICTS SO THAT THERE IS SOME SENSE OF. STATE STANDARD AS ZETIAN BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE ABSOLUTELY NONE AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU SO THIS ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO A LOT OF WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN UNDER ISSUE TO WITH DISTANCE LEARNING I CAN PROVIDE YOU A LITTLE BIT AND TAKE BITS AROUND WHAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING ON WHAT QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING LOOKS LIKE. AND HOW IT CAN BE ADDRESSED VERSUS LOW TECH YOU ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH HIGH TECH OPTIONS AND SO REALLY QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING IS ABOUT. CONNECTING TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TOGETHER THERE'S AN INTENTIONAL CONNECTION THERE THE SECRETS OF INSTRUCTION IS THOUGHTFUL RELEVANT TO REAL WORLD APPLICATION THE PRESENTATION OF CONTENT USES MULTIPLE OUT. DALLY THESE THAT THERE IS A OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS CUT TO COLLABORATE AND THERE'S ALSO A FEEDBACK LOOP FOR STUDENTS ON THEIR PROGRESS OF LEARNING AND THAT CAN BE DONE THROUGH. VARIOUS MODES YOUR PAPER ASSIGNMENTS THROUGH THE PHONE- AND THEN ALSO THROUGH AND DEVICES AND SO. WITH HAVING A LOCAL CONTROL STATE OUR GOAL HERE IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS TO SHOW THE BEST PRACTICES AND WE'VE BEEN DOING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITH WEBINARS WHERE FIRST WEAPON ARE ON INNOVATIONS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. HAD OVER EIGHT THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS AND NOW HAS OVER SIXTY THOUSAND VIEWS AND THAT WAS JUST OUR FIRST ONE WE BUILT OUR CLIENTELE I SHOULD SAY AS FAR AS I'M PARTICIPATING IN OUR WEBINARS AND VIEWING THEM. THROUGHOUT THIS PAST FIVE SIX WEEKS AND SO WE ARE PROVIDING DISTINCT TO GUIDANCE ON WHAT QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH DISTRICTS ON DISTRICTS BEST PRACTICES SO. GLENDALE UNIFIED TO TELL MISS UNIFIED SAN DIEGO UNIFIED HAVE BEEN SHARING THEIR BEST PRACTICES. SO ALTHOUGH. TO MAY NOT HAVE THE DEVICE WE ARE INCREASE SHOWING WAYS TO CONNECT WITH STUDENTS AND TO ENGAGE THEM HARDENING EVEN WITHOUT A DEVICE. THOSE FAMILIES THAT HAVE DEVICES THAT I NEED THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT WORKING WITH DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A COMPANIES ON WITHIN THE FAMILY AND HOW TO ACCESS AND- AND YOU REALIZE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ON THE DEVICE THAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM. SO WE HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF GUIDANCE- STATE SO ARE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE WHAT GUIDANCE WE PROVIDE. A HIGHLIGHTS BEST PRACTICES. AND UNDERSTAND THE YOUR LOCAL CONTROL STATEMENT WHAT ONE THING WE- WHAT WHAT DID WE DO HAVE A STATE STANDARD- ON IS THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF SCHOOL. RIGHT IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT A MAN CORRECT ON THAT. THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY MAN DATED TO CONTENT AREA IS P. E. IT'S TWO HUNDRED TEN MINUTES I'M EVERY TEN DAYS WE DO HAVE INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTE REQUIREMENTS THROUGHOUT THE INSTRUCTIONAL YEAR BUT THAT WAS ALL WAVED IT THROUGH THAT INITIAL EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE GOVERNOR. SO NOW IT'S JUST TEACHERS ARE ENGAGING DISTANCE LEARNING LOOKS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. AT AT ONE LESSON YOU COULD BE AN ISSUE WITH A TEACHER CONNECTING WITH STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT WAYS FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MINUTES AND THEN GIVING THEM TO SIGN IT TO CONDUCT AFTER THAT INITIAL CONNECTION WITH THE TEACHER CONCLUDES AND THEN RETURNING BACK AND SHARING THEIR LEARNING. AND SO INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT SAY DIFFERENT AND A DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. THE END WE DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT STARTING IN THE NEXT FALL HI I HOPE WE DON'T BUT WE MAY. IN IN GOING INTO THAT. HI BUT HAVE YOU START TO GRAPPLE WITH WHAT- WHAT DISTANCE LEARNING MAY LOOK LIKE IN THE FALL ON. YOUR SAY WITHOUT HOURS BEING WAVED HER WITHOUT YOU KNOW GO GO GOING BACK TO MORE OF IT YOU DON'T. HAVING THE MORE TRADITIONAL GUIDELINES BUT DOING IT MORE THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING OR- MAYBE YOU'RE DOING IT THROUGH HALF DISTANCE LEARNING SO SOME OF YOUR KIDS ARE COMING YOU'RE ONLY HALF THE NUMBER OF KIDS. IN THE SCHOOL PER DAY I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS ARE BUT- SEC ACTUALLY GETTING INTO A LOT OF BY WHAT I'LL BE SHARING UNDER ISSUE TO. AND TALK ABOUT WE ARE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBERAND CTA PRESIDENT TO LEAD ON CO CHAIRING A COMMITTEE THAT WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE CONTINUITY OF LEARNING. AND ADDRESSES ANY LEARNING SITE THAT IT HAPPENED DURING DISTANCE LEARNING WAS AMPLIFIED DURING THE SUMMERTIME AND ALL THROUGH THE LENS OF EQUITY FOR EVERY STUDENTS. OKAY PERVERT THE KNOWLEDGE NOT JUST WAIT- FOR ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS TELL THEM THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. YES MISTER O'DONNELL I'VE JUST JUST WANT ONE QUICK COMMENT WE TALKED YOU KNOW PEOPLE TALK ON WHAT CAN WE DO TODAY WELL I KNOW STARTING NEXT WEEK ONE THING WE CAN DO AS A BODY IS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. FORWARDING A LOT OF NEW POLICY A LOT OF NEW LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO DO A LOT MORE THAN THEY ARE IN HERE ARE DOING EVERY YEAR IS THAT IS THE SIGNAL MISTER MISTER WHAT'S NICE IS THAT A SIGNAL MISTER ENGINEER ON YOUR PILLOW WELL I MEAN A HUNDRED ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY BILLS THIS YEAR RIGHT OKAY HAD BECAUSE ALREADY VERY HIGH. AND MAYBE THIS YEAR WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT SCHOOLS ARE UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE TO PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING EXCEDRIN AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A SEVERE. I OTHER BUDGET. PROBABLY GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT AND AS A BODY WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT. SO WHEN YOU SEE WHAT BILLS WE HEAR THIS YEAR AND WHAT BILLS WE DON'T. I JUST KNOW THAT THAT'S- PROBABLY SOME OF THE THINKING GOING ON BEHIND THE COMMITTEE. BACK YOU MISTER CHAIR FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH. OKAY THANK YOU I WILL NOW GO ON TO OUR NEXT ISSUE OUR NEXT PANEL. IN THIS- FRANKLY IS THE MEAT OF TODAY'S CONVERSATION. AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WITH DISTANCE LEARNING AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS- APPLES.TO APPLES. AND SPECIFICALLY HOW WE CAN MITIGATE LEARNING LOS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SO WE HAVE A- PANEL OF- QUITE A FEW PRESENTERS WE GIVE EVERYBODY A TIME LIMIT TO. A FIVE MINUTES IS THAT CORRECT MISS CABLE. FIVE MINUTES PER PRESENTER. SELF WEEKEND- LINE UP AND STARTS. AND START THIS- PANEL SO WE'LL START OFF WITH STEPHANIE GREGSON DEPARTMENT OF ADD LINDA DARLING HAMMOND THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

WITH ME I HAVE SEEN CO TWO IS OUR DIRECTOR OF THE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES DIVISION INVESTING OUR LEAD WITH ME ON ALL DISTANCE LEARNING. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE RAN AN UNPRECEDENTED TIME WHERE NOW MORE THAN EVER WE ONLY- STRONGER IT FOR WORKING TOGETHER. MARCH THIRTEENTH BEGAN A QUICK PIVOT TO SUPPORTING STUDENTS THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT NOT ONLY FOR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES BUT FOR THE CD AS WELL. WE'VE HAD A DISTRACTION A FORMAL CONTENT DELIVERY BUT THE LEARNING HASN'T STOPPED. QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IT MEANS LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION ARE HAPPENING EVEN WHEN THE STUDENT AND TEACHER ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES LOCATIONS. ALL LEARNING INCLUDES AN INTENTIONAL TEACHER AND STUDENT CONNECTIONS. SEQUENCE INSTRUCTION GROUNDED IN THE STANDARDS AND PROVIDES RELEVANT AND MEANINGFUL. REAL WORLD AT. KIND IS PRETTY USING MULTIPLE TYPES OF MODALITIES STUDENTS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE WITH PEERS AND THERE'S A FEEDBACK LOOP TO CHECK FOR LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING. WELL THE DISTANCE LEARNING CAN UTILIZE ANY DIFFERENT LOW TECH TO HIGH TECH TOOLS RANGING FROM PAPER ASSIGNMENTS TO AN ONLINE LEARNING MANAGEMENT. OR WITH OVER 95% OF OUR SCHOOLS PIVOTED TO DISTANCE LEARNING WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF BEST PRACTICES INCLUDING A DISTANCE LEARNING PLAN THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT A BALLOT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THEIR WEBSITE. WE ALSO HAVE TEACHERS THAT ARE UTILIZING THIS OPPORTUNITY YOU STUDENTS LIVED EXPERIENCES AN EXISTING KNOWLEDGE FURTHER ENHANCE THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING EXPERIENCES. FOR EXAMPLES. TEACHERS ARE ASKING STUDENTS TO CREATIVELY DOCUMENTS EXPERIENCES DURING THIS TIME. SHARING WITH THE CLASSES AND MAKING CONNECTIONS TO SCIENCE MATH LANGUAGE AND MUCH MORE. JUST BORDER LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES OVER THE PAST SIX WEEKS. WEEKS WEEK THIS CD AIR FOR. INSTANCE PORT SO BOLD AND- IS WE HAVE A SITE THAT HOUSES A PLETHORA OF RESOURCES AND SPECIFIC. ON DISTANCE LEARNING THAT INCLUDES KEY ELEMENTS OF WHAT DISTANCE LEARNING CAN LOOK LIKE READING BASS BEST PRACTICES AND MUCH MORE WE ALSO PROVIDED WEAPON. IN AVERAGE OF THREE A WEEK RIGHT NOW FOCUSED ON INNOVATION FOR DISTANCE. NOT ONLY SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS. SINCE BEST. AND I MENTAL. WE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS NOT AN EASY TIME ANY OF US AND THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS IS CRITICAL. WE THEN BATTED SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ELEMENTS THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR GREAT IN SUPPORT AND THIS WEEK WE ARE BEGINNING A PARENT SUPPORT CIRCLES WE'LL BE STARTING EDUCATOR AND STUDENT SUPPORT CIRCLES IN THE COMING. WEEKS RESPONSE IN HAVE A TO DISTANCE ARE HAS A- OUR EXISTING. INCLUDING THE DIVIDE. OUR STATE SHE BRINGS UP AND TOM BERMAN FROM THE BEGINNING HAS MADE MEETING STUDENTS BASIC MEANS AND ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO LEARNING RESOURCES PRIORITY. AND NOW THIS INCLUDES EQUITY IN DISTANCE LEARNING. HE BEGAN ADDITIONAL TASK FORCE THAT IS CO CHAIRED. BY SENATOR CONNIE LEIVA AND INCLUDES SENATOR MCGUIRE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IDR CURRY WOULD SANTIAGO GARCIA AND BURKE THE TASK FORCE MEMBERS REFLECT THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH GREATEST CONNECTIVITY NEEDS ARE USING DATA COLLECTED BY THE SEAT TO PINPOINT CONNECTIVITY ISSUES ISSUE AREAS AND LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT HAVE STUDENT TO NEEDED VICES. I'M THIS WORK WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVICES AT OVER TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND HOT SPOT. LAST WEEK THE TASK FORCE HELD A FACT FINDING SESSIONS WITH THE CEOS OF INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DISCUSS HOW WE CAN ADDRESS ACTIVITY HERE. THE TASK FOR DELIVERED A MESSAGE THE I. S. P.'S SHOULD BE PROVIDING FREE WIFI TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES WE KNOW THAT BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY NEEDS TO FLOW LIKE TRISTA ELECTRICITY FOR ALL OUR STUDENTS. OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT HAS AMPLIFIED A CALL TO ACTION FOR DONATIONS OF DEVICES AND FUNDS TO PURCHASE DEVICES EVEN CREATING A DEDICATED EMAIL DONATE TACK AT CD E. DOT CA DOC I HAVE WE HAVE SOME OF OUR DONATIONS THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO. DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS WEEK. OTHER GAP AREAS HAVE ALSO BEEN INTENSIFIED DURING THIS TIME AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE A LEARNING SITE IS INEVITABLE FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. IN FACT THE AND W. EA RECENTLY RELEASED PRODUCTIONS AT THE SUMMER MELT WILL BE AMPLIFIED AND SUGGESTS IMPOSSIBLE IMPACTS MAYBE LARGER IN MATHEMATICS AND IN READING. THIS MERE IS THE CURRENT STATE DATA THAT ALREADY SHOW THIS GAP BETWEEN SUBJECT AREAS. WE ALSO RECEIVE MANY QUESTIONS REGARDING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THE EFFECTIVENESS LEARNING IS HAVING ON THEIR LEARNING GROW. THIS SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING ALL STUDENTS NEEDS. HE MET WHERE THEY ARE AND EFFECTIVELY HAND ENHANCING THEIR EARNING AN UNDERSTANDING TO MOVE THEM FORWARD IT IS WHY AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE'VE COMMIT DEVELOPED A COMMITTEE THAT'S CO CHAIRED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. AND ARE SEE EACH YEAR PRESIDENT SHALL BE VOID IT WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS LEARNING LAST REAL LENDS AN EQUITY FOR EVERY STUDENTS. I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE KNOWLEDGE IN THE WHAT ARE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES HAVE ACCOMPLISHED INCLUDING TO DISTANCE LEARNING ON A DIME NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING. WE KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND THINGS ARE NOT PERFECT BUT OUR STUDENTS ARE LEARNING AND OUR TEACHERS ARE LEARNING AS WELL WE'RE IN A NEW PLACE TO TAKE THESE NEW LEARNINGS AND APPLY THEM TO WHAT SCHOOL CAN LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS UNPRECEDENTED AND IT HAS AMPLIFIED ALREADY EXISTING GAPS BY LEARNING TOGETHER PROBLEM SOLVING TOGETHER AND WORKING TOGETHER% ALL OUR STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT. OUR TEAM IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT YOU AND BE THOUGHT PARTNERS AS WE CAN SEE YOU TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS ROSS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS TODAY. YOU. OKAY LINDA DARLING HAMMOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE BEING PART OF THIS HEARING YOU'RE ASKING EXACTLY THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AT THE RIGHT TIME I IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE THINK NOW ABOUT HOW TO MITIGATE LEARNING LOS UP AND THIS IS A TIME NOT ONLY CRISIS BUT OF OPPORTUNITY A BECAUSE IT'S PUT A FLASHLIGHT ON MANY OF THE LONG STANDING EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND IT GIVES US THE URGENCY IN FOCUS. NEEDED TO PULL TOGETHER SOLUTIONS FOR CLOSING THOSE GAPS AND RE IMAGINING OUR SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION SO WE EMERGE WITH THE MORE INNOVATIVE AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM I WANTED OF THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A BETTER START ON THESE GOALS THE MANY OTHER STATES THAT CLOSE SCHOOLS DONE NOTHING TO CONTINUE EDUCATION FOR THEIR STUDENTS. AND THOSE OF STATES THAT THE END OF NEW NAY REPORT THAT'S BEEN REFERENCED ARE IS REALLY TALKING ABOUT DISTRICTS OF COURSE VERY DID HOW THEY MANAGE TO INITIAL CLOSURES- BUT A 100% OF THEM ARE NOW ENGAGED IN FORMAL DISTANCE LEARNING AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM. THANKS ABOUT THAT SIGNET IN A- REMAIN AND TO ADDRESS THOSE. I THINK WE NEED TO AT LEAST FIVE THINGS. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WHEN THE PANDEMIC BEGAN ABOUT ONE IN FIVE STUDENTS WERE ESTIMATED TO LACK DEVICES ARE CONNECTIVITY OF ALL. FOR THE ROAD EFFORTS OF MANY DISTRICTS LARGE AND SMALL. FROM LOS ANGELES TO TINY LITTLE ALL POP. DEEP INTO THEIR RESERVES TO BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS AND HOT SPOTS. I THINK THAT IT'S A WE PROBABLY CUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY ABOUT HALF. OF ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT TICKET MASTER SURVEY NINETY SIX PERCENT. OF DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING JUST DEVICES JUST STUDENTS. AND 86% ARE PROVIDING HOT SPOTS- IN SOME FASHION. IN ABOUT 7% OF OUR DISTRICTS VIRTUALLY ALL STUDENTS HAVE. ACCESS TO THE CRISIS. IN ABOUT SIXTY. THIRD DISTRICTS VIRTUALLY ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO CONNECTIVITY THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO HOWEVER. IN ABOUT ONE FIVE DISTRICTS AT LEAST 30% OF STUDENTS. LACK ACCESS TO CONNECTIVITY YOUR DEVICES. OFTEN WILL START ALL AND RURAL DISTRICTS. BUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE EXISTS ACROSS ALL KINDS OF DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. THE GOVERNOR FIRST PARTNER STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING TO RAISE PRIVATE DONATIONS. FROM CORPORATIONS OF FOUNDATIONS TO CLOSE THIS DIVIDE. WE RECEIVED SOME IMPRESSIVE CONTRIBUTIONS BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH. EVEN WITH THESE ONGOING EFFORTS WILL NEED AT LEAST A HUNDRED. DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT THE CLOSE THE DIVIDE AND CHANGE. ACCESS FOR STUDENTS- AND THAT'S BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED. DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THE- CHROMEBOOK AT YOURS. HI THIS. WE ARE A FEW WEEKS ALREADY MENTIONED THE THAT SUMMER EFFORTS JUST OF WORDING A WILL IN OFFER NEED TO BE WE TO ADJUST THE PATEL CLOSE AGAIN I THE FALL WINTER IF ANOTHER THERE WERE LAW TO SEE THE OF BLOOD LEARNING EVEN ONE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN IN ORDER TO SUPPORT SOCIAL DISTANCING AND STUDENTS REMAINING WARRANTY AND TO PRESERVE SAFETY- THERE ARE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT. RESERVING SOCIAL DISTANCING BY HAVING SOME KIDS ON DIGITAL LEARNING SOME DAYS A WEEK WHILE OTHERS ARE IN SCHOOL AND THEN INTO REVERSING STUFF UP PARTICIPATIONIN PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL LEARNING UP FOR LEARNING TO BE CONTINUES TO REALLY NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FULLY ACTIVE I JUST WOULD LIKE TO DOUBT THAT THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO THE SAME LOW INCOME FAMILIES OKAY WAS PARTICIPATING TELEHEALTH SECURE BENEFITS APPLY FOR EMPLOYMENT OR PROTECT THEIR HEALTH I SHOPPING ONLINE. AND WE NEED TO HAVE ALL STUDENTS TECHNOLOGICALLY PROFICIENT IN A STATE WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS THE DRIVER OF THE ENEMY WHEN THEY TO YOU THE SUMMER WELL SECOND POINT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT STUDENTS WERE LIKELY TO OFFER THIS BEHIND LOS LEARNER STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ALMOST STUDENTS OTHERS WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS INSTRUCTION ON MANY DISTRICTS ARE MAKING PLANS TO DO THIS SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE WORKING WITH EXPERT TEACHERS. DESIGN CURRICULAR MATERIALS THAT CAN BE USED ONLINE IF NEEDED AND COLLABORATION WITH THE C. C. SOME ACCEPTS BECAUSE CONTINUE CONSTRUCTION AS THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR OKAY THE NEXT EARLY RESPONSE STUDENTS TOOK YOUR NEED TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PROGRESS THIRD WE NEED TO HELP INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY PUT EVERY DISTRICT THAT PROVIDED THE HEARING REGULAR ON THAT OF IS GROUNDED IN OUR CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS WITH IN PERSON AND DISTANCE LEARNING RESOURCES AT EVERY GRADE. LEVEL FOR ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING INCORPORATE. THOSE PLANS ARE YOU FOR STUDENTS WHO JUST. NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TOGGLE BETWEEN BEING. OPEN AND CLOSE POTENTIALLY WALK BUT IS ISSUE BUT ALSO TO SUPPORT LONG TERM SCHOOL EXPERIENCING. WHAT WE HAVE OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS LIKE WILD FIRES THAT MADE FOR SCHOOL CLOSURES. ARE WITH THE PROSPECT OF CLIMATE RELATED CHALLENGES GROWING WE NEED TO PLAN FOR FLEXIBILITY IN THE PLACE OF THE MORNING BUT NOT THE PROSPECTS FOR LEARNING. SO THAT WE'RE NOT CONFRONTING LEARNING LOS REGULARLY. WHEN WE BEGAN TO PULL TOGETHER RESOURCES. FOR THE- STATE BOARD AND CDC GUIDANCE TO DISTRICTS ONE OF THE FIRST I THOUGHT WHAT'S STRONG RESOURCES AND CONTINUITY PLANS WAS MIAMI DADE COUNTY FLORIDA. BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOW HAD FLOODS AND HURRICANES REGULARLY AND THEY ARE NOW PREPARED TO GO IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL I IN A SEAMLESS WAY WE NEED THAT SAME. AS THE- STATE CAN SUPPORT THIS EFFORT WITH AWFUL CURRICULUM RESOURCES AND TRAINING- AND WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS A COMPETENCY BASED APPROACH THAT IS NOT FOCUSED ONLY ON STEEP TIME. AS THE MEASURE OF INSTRUCTIONAL- ENGAGEMENT. FOR ONE SCHOOL WE WILL TO TAKE OF STUDENTS LEARNING NEED BUT THERE'S- MOST AND ACADEMIC. WE SHOULD WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS SOME EXPERTS HAVE ADVISED THAT STUDENTS SHOULD RETURNS THE STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE THIS PAST YEAR- WHO KNOW THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR LEARNING NEEDS AND APPROACHES. OR BEST POSITIONS TO WELCOME THEM WITH UNDERSTANDING AND COMPASSION TO DIAGNOSE WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR LIVES AND THEIR LEARNING TO CONNECT THEM THE NECESSARY SOCIAL SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES WHERE THOSE ARE NEEDED. AND TO HELP THEM MAKE RAPID PROGRESS WE DO HAVE RESEARCH THAT CONTINUITY AND STUDENT TEACHER RELATIONSHIPS BRINGS SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN TEACH MORE EFFECTIVELY WOMEN OTHER STUDENTS WELL AND STUDENTS LEARN MORE EFFECTIVELY. IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF TRUST OF THE LONGING- SOME EXPERTS THINK OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE DONE FOR A QUARTER BEFORE PASSING STUDENTSON TO THE NEXT GRADE LEVEL TEACHER. OTHER SCHOOLS MIGHT DECIDE TO DO THAT IN A LOOPING FASHION FOR THE WHOLE YEAR WHILE ALSO NATURE EVALUATE WHERE STUDENTS ARE ACADEMICALLY A WE WILL NEED TO USE OUR WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE- REGULAR CLASSROOM DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS IN MANY GRADES. WERE ALSO FORTUNATE TO HAVE RESOURCES OF. BROWN'S ASSESSED THAT ARE REALLY WILL. SOLVE JUST. THESE CAN BE YOU IN. WAYS AROUND THE CIVIC AREAS OF THE CURRICULUM OR IN AN ASSESSMENT THAT. MIRRORS WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THE- END OF YOUR TEST UP ACROSS THE ENTIRE. CURRICULUM FOR THAT GRADE LEVEL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK OF THIS AS A DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS NOT AS A WAY TO LABEL STUDENTS- OR THE FISSION SEIZE OR OR GRADE RETENTION WHICH HAS. TYPICALLY BEEN FOUND NOT NOT TO WORK AND WHEN STUDENTS. STIGMATIZING LABEL IT ACTUALLY AFFECTS THEIR FUTURE WORDING SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BURNING PROGRESS BEING SUPPORTED. THE LABELING STUDENTS BEING THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS AND FINALLY TO MEET STUDENT LEARNING NEEDS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON EXPAND OR LEARNING TIME AN OPPORTUNE. AS WELL AS ON SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS THOSE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT INCLUDE INTENSIVE LITERACY AND MATH INSTRUCTION WITHIN ALL TEACHERS SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. AND EXPADED LEARNING TIME THAT MAY BE CREATED BY SUMMER SCHOOL STARTED THIS FOR YOUR EARLIER ANY AFTER SCHOOL OR SATURDAYS FULL TIME. OR RETHINKING HOW SCHEDULES WITH OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RETIREMENT INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES THAT USE THAT WE KNOW ARE EFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING WRONG LEARNING GAMES QUICKLY IN THE STATE SHOULD PROVIDE BOTH INFORMATION ABOUT EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES ARE RESOURCES TO ACCESS THEM AND THEN WE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING WHICH ARE VERY LARGE FFECTS. ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AS WELL AND ONE STRATEGY MAY BE LEVERAGING COMMUNITY PARTNERS AS SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED HAS DONE. WITH TWO HUNDRED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER DISTRICTS ARE DOING AS WELL WE'RE SEEING THEIR PLACES THAT HAVE COMMUNITY SCHOOL STRATEGY. EXCUSE ME THAT- DO- IN A GREAT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS IN. ARE ABLE TO MEET STUDENTS NEEDS WERE OFFICIALLY WE MAY WANT TO- URGE THOSE STRATEGIES IN THE FUTURE. FIRST CARE SECTOR WILL BE A SECOND ONE THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DRAFTED WASHINGTON DC. AND WE NEED TO BE. ABLE TO AFFECT THE PURPOSEFUL USE THOSE WORDS WAS. OKAY CHECK IT QUESTIONS LATER THANK YOU. NEXT PANELIST. HEY OTHER HELP FIND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HEAT HELLO OUR FOR CALIFORNIA EDUCATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME THANK. WE HAVE LOCAL AGENTS HAD US WERE IN. I EIGHT SEVEN WILL BE LOOKING FOR ENTRY AND RECOVERY AND ALSO MY HERE TODAY BRAND LOOKING HAVE ALL. AND FOR YOU TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING REFER.

MOMENT AND THE THIRD THAT SCHOOLS WILL BE RESOURCE AND FLEXIBILITY ME BACK WILL. ANSWER OKAY. AND IT. ALL START WHAT THE RESEARCH. STUDENTS AND SOME GREAT RETURN AND ALL TWENTY A FULL YEAR I AM. IN NORMAL ISSUE. AND THAT'S JUST THE AVERAGE CONTINUING TO. WE ALL KNOW THAT SO CALLED SUMMER. IS WORSE FOR LOW INCOME. IF THEY'RE NOT LIKELY HIGHER INCOME HERE'S HAVE A GREAT DENNY HONOR. FURTHERMORE WE SHOULD EXPECT IT YEAH GROW IS OR IS IN NINETEEN SIXTY ARE BEING IMPACT BY THE- VERY TO WAYS. IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE MEETING THE NEEDS TO LEARN ENGLISH IT IS WITH THE LADIES FIRST THAT WERE ALREADY. AND NEEDING TARGET WORK THIS CRISIS ALSO MEAN THAT MANY ARE. VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THEIR HOMES IT DIRE CASES STUDENTS WILL HAVE EXPERIENCED. AS ISSUES OF POVERTY HOUSING ACT. WHAT INSECURITY ARE COMPOUNDED BY LOSS IN USE AND WE KNOW BOTH THE HELP AND I CAN IMPACT THAT WILL GET NINETEEN HAVE. IF LOW INCOME AFRICAN AMERICAN AND BLACK AND. IT WILL BE IN BURIED DO WE NEED A TO WITH THIS IN A TEACHER PLAN. ACTION WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY FACT POINT WE MUST DEVELOP A SYSTEM WAY OF ASSESSING THE ACT AND WOMAN NEEDS IT IS WHEN THEY ENTERS. IT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WILL BE BEHIND GRADE LEVEL AFTER WE STUDENTS INTEREST WILL WE NEED ACADEMIC THIS. THAT TO THE- WHICH EACH OTHER HAS ACQUIRE. AND WHAT SKILLS CLINTON EACH STUDENT WILL NEED TO TALK. ME IS NEED TO MAKE. AT MULTIPLE. RIGHT NOW. AS YOU KNOW EACH YEAR THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT CONSORTIUM I THANK TESTIFIED IF YOU'RE TO CALIFORNIA STUDENT IN THE- NOT MINISTER. TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO BE TIGHTLY ONLINE RIGHT CALIFORNIA CONTENT STANDARDS IT SEEMS LIKE SOME MODIFICATIONS BUT THE THING I MEANT. HE USED TO DEVELOP AN F. DIAGNOSTIC PERHAPS BUILDING LINE- SOME OF THE SAVINGS THAT WE NEED IN THE SPRING. AND ALSO NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO TAKE STOCK OF STUDENTS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND ASSESS THEIR GENERAL WELL BEING I THINK HER FOOD AND HOUSING SECURITY SENSE OF LONGING AND YET WHO READY TO LEARN AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ONCE YOU CAN EITHER UNDERSTOOD. SCHOOL EAT THEM WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY THERE. ALSO A FREE FOR AND TO MEET THE HEIGHTENED. CERTAIN CONTACT INTERNET YEAR NONE OF US KNOWS AT WHAT SCHOOL LOOK LIKE A THE FALL THEY THAT'S IT ALL THAT MUCH BUT WE DO KNOW IT WILL DIFFERENT IT BEFORE THE. THE GOVERNOR HAS ANNOUNCED AND WILL BE ANNOUNCING READER YEAH I THINK MORE AT SCHOOL BE PREPARED TO READ DESIGNED TO SUPPORT SOCIAL THE THING YOU'RE AT THE- LEARNING.

I THANK THE STAFFING LEVELS WE ALSO NEED THAT HEALTH AND THEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS YOUR SCHOOL OUR STATE. AND I'M THE ITEMS. HE PERHAPS NO IMPORTANT WE NEED TO PROTECT FUNDING FOR. AND THE SURE TERM THINK THIS FUNDING AT ABOUT. YEAH LEVEL SHIELDING RIGHT EDUCATION GRANTS FORGET. EVERYTHING REFERRAL AND ANYONE IN FUNDS ON SCHOOL. STUDENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY. OKAY THANK YOU CAN. OKAY MINE. HELLO MY NAME IS TERREL CAMP I AM CURRENTLY THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE SAN LORENZO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I AM ALSO VERY ACTIVE WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA% SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ATTACK GIVE YOU AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND OUR DISTRICT HAS BEEN VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN IN JUST WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE OTHER PANELISTS OUR MAJOR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON MAIL DISTRIBUTION FOR STUDENTS DURING THAT FIRST WEEK IN NOW THAT WE'RE DOING. THERE IN CONSISTENT BASIS OUR OUR TRANSITION HAS BEEN WHAT I WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE GET DEVICESIN THE HANDS OF OUR STUDENTS. AND STUFF WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT HOW STUDENTS NEED VICE AS WELL WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT A NUMBER PRESS STAFF ACTUALLY NEED DEVICES AND CAN ACTIVITY AS WELL. THAT'S BEEN A MAJOR FOCUS AND RIGHT ALONG WITH THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING A NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES- OUR OUR OUR STAFF IS WE'RE TRANSITIONING TO. DELIVERING INSTRUCTION DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE OBVIOUSLY RIGHT ALONG WITH THAT PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AS BEEN EMPHASIZING THAT OUR OUR STAFF NEEDS TO CONNECT WITH STUDENTS. THE PANDEMIC IN IN THE POST FOCUS OUR FIRST FORMAL SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SIDE OF THINGS. I RECOGNIZING THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE IN A PLACE THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN. BEEN BEFORE AND WE JUST RECENTLY DEVELOPED- IMHO YOU WITH OUR TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THAT FURTHER CLARIFIED TO EXPECTATIONS FOR STAFF. AND STUDENTS AND WHAT WILL GRADING LOOK LIKE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER. IN ORDER OF OUR SCHOOL. SO IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF JEFF THAT IS JUST WORKING WITH PROFESSIONAL SO SHE THINK. EXPECT ALL RIGHT ALONG WITH THAT WE'RE STARTING AS WE WIND DOWN THIS SCHOOL YEAR WHERE SPENDING SOME TIME NOW THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FALL WHEN OR IF SCHOOL IS RE OPENING OBVIOUSLY SOME. THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT OUR WHT WE HAVE TO DO TO YOU PROVIDED DESKTOP RUSHED A STRUCTURE FOR LEARNING TO OCCUR I THAT MIGHT MEAN AND PROBABLY WILL BE IN A DEVELOPING STRUCTURES WHERE WE'RE PRACTICING PHYSICAL DISTANCE THING. HAVING NO MORE THAN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STUDENTS IN A CLASSROOM IF YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP STUDENTS SIX FEET APART AS STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOL- MAYBE NET FIVE TIMES A WEEK BUT MAYBE ONE TO THREE TIMES A WEEK. DEPENDING ON THE STUDENTS AND THEIR ARRANGEMENT SO IN IN SUMMARY IT'S ONLY IT'S- LOOKING TO HAVE AN EIGHTY ONE FEATHER ONE RID THE KIDS OUT OF OUR STUDENTS ON CAMPUS OR IN CLASSES AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME ALSO EXPLORING CONCEPTS LIKE BLENDED MODELS THAT WE ARE. IT'S PART THE TIME THAT STUDENTS BEEN WITH THOSE WILL BE ACTUALLY IN THE SCHOOLS AND IN THE CLASSES IN PART OF IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONLINE. AND THEN JUST PREPARING FOR WHAT WOULD IT UNEXPECTED CLOSURES LOOK LIKE IN THE EVENT THAT WE HAVE EIGHT COMMUNITIES SPREAD HER SCHOOL WIDE CASES OF. OF CONFIRMED CASES OF KOBE NINETEEN SO WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK. LIKE FOR OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM WERE NET USED OPERATING IN THAT MANNER I SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING WILL BE ON STUDENT WILL BE WITH STUDENT ATTENDANCE. OBVIOUSLY OUR MODEL AND I'LL GET BETTER RECOMMENDATIONS ALSO OUR MODEL OF A CATHOLIC YOUR STUDENT ATTENDANCE I CAN THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T TRANSLATE WELL TO OUR CURRENT DISTANCE LEARNING FORMAT. I WILL ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF WE HAVE. STAFF THAT THE NEED OF LEAVE ALSO. THE SERVER SO STAPP BETTER OVER SIXTY FIVE WORK HAVE COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEM OR THEY HAVE ELDERLY AT HOME THAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT. THEIR WORD ABOUT INFECTING WHAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR STAFF THAT WILL BE GONE PROBABLY MORE THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN USED TO IN THE PAST. I WE WILL OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MITIGATING SCHOOL CLOSURE. I IN THIS. MITIGATING THAT. CLOSES THE PATTERN THAT HAVE OCCURRED THIS SPRING. AND THE LEARNING LOST SO WE'RE WE'RE THERE'S CONVERSATIONS YOU HEARD IT FROM THE PREVIOUS PANELIST. AND THEN THE REALITY IS WE HAD A FISCAL CRISIS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CRISIS WHERE I WOULD SAY PROBABLY ABOUT 4260% OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ALREADY WAR HAVING STAFF REDUCTION CONVERSATION I KNOW IN MY PERSONAL SITUATION IN FEBRUARY WE HAD A RESOLUTION TO THE BOARD WHERE WE WERE ELIMINATING YOU. BETWEEN OUT FORTY FIVE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS ON THE CERTIFICATED SIDE OF THINGS AND I WAS ONCE AGAIN THE CRISIS BEFORE THE CRISIS. INDEED THIS THAT HAS DECLINED ENROLLMENT. IT'S BEEN. IT'S IT WILL PROBABLY BE PROBABLY BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT REDUCING EXPENDITURES AND WHEN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. ROUGHLY STAFF THAT MEANS REDUCING STAFF. SO THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE IN THE WORKS BEFORE THE CRISIS. AND SOMETIMES THE CHALLENGES WITH MITIGATING THE LEARNING LOS THAT'S OCCURRING RIGHT NOW WILL BE DIFFICULT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING TIME WHICH MEANS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES. THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON. A REALLY THREE YOU'VE HEARD IT. YOU'VE HEARD IT A IN TERMS OF- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES AND SCHOOL DAYS FOR STUDENTS ARE HAD EVEN QUANTIFY SCHOOL DAY FOR STUDENTS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THE FISCAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE MAJOR THOSE ARE MAJOR I WHATEVER AWFULLY THE GOVERNOR. I HAD THE TWO POINT TWO NINE COLA AT- JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL I THAT WAS DOWN FROM A THREE POINT OH- COLA THAT WE ARE UTILIZING THE PREVIOUS PROJECTIONS. ARE SO WHATEVER MAINTENANCE OF A COLOR AT LEAST A STATUTORY COLA WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS WELL AS THE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE GOING TOWARD SPECIAL EDUCATION AND PARTICULARLY THAT. THE PRE FORMAL OR OR THE PRESCHOOL STUDENTS THAT WEEK AT FUNDING FOR LAST YEAR. THAT WAS HELPFUL AND IF THAT WOULD CONTINUE THAT WOULD BE TREMENDOUS AND MAYBE EVEN INCLUDE IN THAT THAT OUR REGULAR FUNDING FORMULA- THE MONEY BECAUSE PRIOR TO THAT WE DID NOT GET DOLLARS. THE SERVER THE SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THAT WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. ARE YOU PARTY TO ABOUT THE PENSION OBLIGATIONS WHATEVER COULD BE DONE IN ORDER TO. TO I WOULD SAY ALLEVIATE BUT MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE PENSION OBLIGATIONS WOULD BE TREMENDOUS THE JUST THE COLA. EDUCATION AND THE PENSIONS WOULD BE WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEN LASTLY ON THE FUNDING OR FISCAL CONSIDERATIONS. A DIFFICULT ROLES WERE UTILIZED AS A STRATEGY ABOUT THAT TEN TWELVE YEARS AGO DURING THE- READ THE GREAT RECESSION.

STUDENTS TO DOESN'T FIRING PROVIDING SCHOOL MILLS AND SUPERVISE STUDENTS ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE THANK THE GOVERNOR AND THE SUIT ADMINISTRATION FROM MAKING THE SAFETY OF OUR STATE COMMUNITIES HIS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THREE THINGS FIRST DISTANCE LEARNING DURING A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC SECOND VULNERABLE STUDENTS IN LEARNING LOSS IN THIRD HOW WE MAKE PLAN TOGETHER TO OPEN SCHOOLS. SAFELY AND RESPONSIBLY WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT. MANY OF YOU ARE BOTH POLICY MAKERS AND PARENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU HEAR AYE COMMENTS TO THE LENS OF THAT'D BE. NOW WE YOU REPRESENTING YOUR DISTRICT. THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. GIVE ME THE FIRST DAY YOU BOUGHT YOUR CHILDREN TO OUR PRESCHOOLS IN KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS WE TALKED ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN PARENTS AND EDUCATORS WE ARE PARTNERS IN THIS MISSION ENSURE THE END GOAL OF HELPING YOUR CHILDREN AND OUR STUDENTS THRIVING GROW AND SUCCEED AS PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. THAT PARTNERSHIP IS THE MORE IMPORTANT NOW AS THE WAY THIS PANDEMIC IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AND POSSIBLY YEARS AHEAD. WE KNOW PARENTS FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS ARE STRESSED SOME OF THEM ARE WORKING FROM HOME MANY ARE UNEMPLOYED AND WONDERING IF THEY HAVE A JOB. TO GO TO BACK WHEN THE ECONOMY OPENS UP AGAIN UNDER THE NEW HEALTH GUIDELINES. UNTIL WE HAVE A VACCINE FOR THE COLBERT NINETEEN. I UP TO THE MINUTE EDUCATORS ARE WORRIED TO. LIKE WHAT SIX GREAT TEACHER AND PRESIDENT ABA NEGERI THE KAESONG WHO WAS FEATURED IN AN APRIL TWENTY FOURTH ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT STUDENTS WHOM THEY'D BEEN UNABLE TO REACH SINCE THIS WAS GO CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE BIBLE STUDENTS WHO HAVE HEALTH ISSUES AND ALREADY COMPROMISED. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THEIR STUDENTS IN THE SINK INTEREST IN UNCERTAIN TIMES. TEACHERS UNDERSTAND COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES RIGHT NOW SOME OF OUR FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING ASSEMBLY AND ABLE TO HANDLE BOTH. STRESS OF THIS CRISIS AND THEIR CHILDREN LEARNING. EDUCATORS ARE LOOSENING AND WE ARE HERE FOR YOU. WE ARE HERE IN THIS TOGETHER. EDUCATING STUDENTS. AT HOME IS COMPLICATED RESTRAINING EXHAUSTING AND HARD SO HEAR ME NOW BECAUSE NINE IN PATIENTS WITH YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILDREN. THIS IS A MOMENT OF TIME AS EXHAUST EVEN TRYING AS IT IS RIGHT NOW IT WILL GET BETTER AND WILL IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE. ONLY SIXTEEN ECHO PROTECT OUR IMMUNITIES AGAIN. DO NOT STRESS IF YOU CAN HELP YOUR CHILD MASTER FRACTIONS WHERE TO STAND UP FOR SALE PEOPLE LEARNING APPROPRIATE USE OF THIS CYNICAL. IT WILL BE OKAY. WE WILL BE YOUR PARTISAN AND DRESSING ANY LEARNING LOSS AS YOU HEARD I WILL BE A CULTURE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS TASK FORCE. WE CAN MUSICALLY OPEN SCHOOLS AGAIN TEACHERS WILL LOOK AT. WHAT EACH CHILD NEEDS AND WORK WITH YOU TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO HELP STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WERE STRUGGLING WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SAFETY. IS LOOKED AT FIRST THAT COULD NOT BE COMPROMISED. AS WE EXPLAIN FIRST PASSED ME AS WAS EXPLAINING THE FIRST PANEL WE'RE FACING A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE STATE BUDGET AND FUNDING FOR LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THIS IS THE PERFECT STORM AND WHICH REVENUES ARE DECLINING DRAMATICALLY WHILE EXPENDITURES CONTINUE INCREASE AS WE FIGHT TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. IT IS HARD TO SEE ANY BUDGET SOLUTION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OUR TEACHER LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOBBYING THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WERE JUST NOT DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE THE DOLLARS WE HAVE RECEIVED SO FAR IT'S SO MUCH NEEDED. WHEN WE RETURN TO SCHOOL CAMPUSES IT NEEDS TO BE PLANNED AND DELIBERATE WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE FOREFRONT ALL DECISION MAKING. SOME DECISIONS OUR STATE DECISIONS AND DIRECTIVES WITH WHILE OTHER DISTANCE DECISIONS WILL BE BEST LEFT TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WORKING WITH THEIR PARENTS. EDUCATORS AND CLASSIFIED PERSONNEL. IN FACT THE EDUCATION COOL COALITION SUBMITTED A LETTER OF LEGISLATURE ON APRIL FIFTEENTH OUTLINING SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED TO RE OPEN THE SCHOOLS. ALWAYS SCHOOLS ARE A CLEAR ECONOMIC DRIVER IN THE STATE'S ECONOMY. OPENING PUBLIC SCHOOL SAFELY RESPONSE WAIT WILL PROVIDE PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT'S NEEDED TO GO BACK TO WORK. WHAT DOES OPENING SCHOOLS LOOK LIKE DOING A PANDEMIC. WE UNDERSTAND A LARGE SCALE TESTING IS KEY AND APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP OF PUSHING MORE TESTING IN THE WEEK AND MONTHS AHEAD. HOWEVER ABSENT OF INDEXING AND THE POTENTIAL NEXT WAVE OF THE VIRUS AND FALL IN THE FALL. PUBLIC SCHOOLS NEEDS TO BE A SAFE RE OPENING WHILE ALSO PLANNING FOR FUTURE CLOSURES. YES AND WHEN THE RESURGENCE OF THE VIRUS A CURSE. WELL THE SCHOOLS NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT STUDENTS EDUCATORS FACULTY IN COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO ASSUME THAT ALL PERSONS THAT COME ON CAMPUS OR SCHOOL BUSES ARE POTENTIAL CAMERAS ON THE VIRUS. THAT PREMISE VERY CENTRAL MEASURES THAT WE NEED POLICYMAKERSTO CONSIDER THAT INCLUDE BUT IT BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING. DEEP CLEANING A CONTINUES QUEEN OF OUR CAMPUSES AND BUSES. THIS CALL DOESN'T SEEM IN CLASSROOMS AND OTHER SHARED SPACES. BASED COVERING GLOVES AND HAND SANITIZERS. RUSSELL CONSIDERATION TO PROTECT STUDENTS AND STAFF WHAT COMPROMISED UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS. SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING SCHOOL NURSES FOR ENHANCE STUDENTS FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS SAFETY. MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM THIS THE IMPACT OF THIS PANDEMIC. THIS IS NOT A WISH LIST OF LUXURY ITEMS THIS IS WHAT IS NEEDED TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS AND SCHOOL SAY. TWENTY FOUR POTENTIAL CERTAIN RESURGENCE OF THE VIRUS WE ALSO NEED TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH ERRANDS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON LOCAL SCHOOL MODELS THAT CAN AND WILL FACILITATE. JUST OF SEE OUR pMODELS CAN IN AN INTEGRATE BOTH IN PERSON AND DISTANCE LEARNING. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS COULD BE RETURNED TO A MULTI YEAR TRACK SYSTEM AM PM SESSIONS AND WALKS SCHEDULING. ALL THESE MODELS REQUIRE SMALLER CLASS SIZES AND MORE TEACHERS. IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE MORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS AND DISTANCE LEARNING AS SAFE RELIABLE PLATFORMS IN WHICH TO ENGAGE STUDENTS DIGITALLY AND CONTINUES SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS WITH DEVICES IN INTERNET ACCESS. YOUR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS OUT THERE BUT WE WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE SCHOOLS. FOR MORE FUNDING AT A TIME WHEN THE BUDGET MAYBE STREAKING. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LATER ADMINISTRATION AS A PARTNER THE NEXT WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD TO ENSURE WE'RE MAKING THE BEST DECISIONS FOR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY. I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME AND I'LL BE AROUND FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH TO BE VOID NEXT WILL HAVE DOCTOR ID AGA WITH THE EDUCATION TRUST. WEST PLEASE PROCEED. EIGHT GOOD MORNING I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS MOMENT FOR EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. LONG BEFORE THE RUN A VIRUS CAN THEY MAKE CAME TO OUR SHORES CALIFORNIA FACED AN EPIDEMIC OF EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY. FOR DECADES WE HAVE GIVEN THE LEAST ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY TO THE STUDENTS NEED IT MOST. WE HAVE STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS POLICE ACCESS COURSE WORK. HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS CRUCIAL TECHNOLOGY AND MOST OF OTHER RESOURCES. AND WE'VE GOTTEN EXACTLY THE RESULTS YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM THE SYSTEM WE'VE CREATED FOR EXAMPLE THE RECENT CALIFORNIA SCIENCE SAYS SHOW THE LESS THAN ONE IN FIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN LAND NEXT LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND JUST 3% OF ENGLISH LEARNERS MEETING STANDARDS. THE DECISIONS CALIFORNIA MAKES RIGHT NOW WILL DETERMINE WHETHER WE BOUNCE BACK STRONGER POSITION TO BUILD A BETTER FAIRER FUTURE ARE WHETHER WE ALLOW THE PANDEMIC TO TURN CRACKS IN OUR FOUNDATION INTO CREVICES. WILL MOVE- THAT THE BEST SOLUTIONS COME FROM THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY ADDRESS WEST CONDUCTED A STATEWIDE POLL IN PARIS EXPERIENCES AMID THE OUTBREAK. WHAT WE HEARD WAS WHAT WE'VE BEEN CALLING A TALE OF TWO CITIES. THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS KEEPING STUDENTS SAFE HEALTHY FED AND HOW. SHUTTING SCHOOLS DOWNTURN IN AN ORDERLY WAY GETTING EVERY. AND THERE'S CALIFORNIA'S LONGSTANDING EDUCATION EQUITY CRISIS. ON THE FIRST COUNT THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS. PARENTS GIVE THEIR SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS HIGH MARKS MOST PARENTS SAID THEY GENERALLY THEIR SCHOOL OR DISTRICT IS DOING AN EXCELLENT OR GOOD JOB MANAGING SCHOOL CLOSURES AND SHARING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. HOWEVER THEY ARE ALSO SCARED ABOUT THE FUTURE AND THEY OFFERED WARNING SIGNS ABOUT HOW THIS PANDEMIC THREATENS TO EXACERBATE THE EQUITY PRICES. THE MAJORITY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATIN EXPERIENCE IN THE SURVEY WORRIED THAT THEY LACK THE RESOURCES TO HELP YOUR CHILD STAY ON TRACK. LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND FAMILIES OF COLOR ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT IN ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IN DEVICES. WILL HINDER THEIR CHILDREN'S DISTANCE LEARNING. UNABLE STUDENT ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON BUT THIS CRISIS HAS CAST IN UNDER A HARSH SPOTLIGHT. WITH SCHOOLS FORCED INTO REMOTE INSTRUCTION GAPS IN DIGITAL ACCESS WILL BECOME GAPS IN STUDENT LEARNING. THERE ARE SOME THINGS SCHOOLS DISTRICTS AND POLICY MAKERS CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO CLOSE THE DIVIDE. FIRST EVALUATE DIGITAL ACCESS NEEDS IN SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS SECOND ADVOCATE FOR PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO SUPPORT HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES. THIRD TARGET TRAINING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN ADDITIONAL IT SUPPORT AND FOURTH REQUIRE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO SHARE THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING LIKE. EVEN IF WE EXPAND DIGITAL ACCESS THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY TO CLOSE SCHOOL FOR MONTHS WITHOUT LEARNING LOSS FOR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THE MOST VULNERABLE. OUR JOB NOW IS TO EQUIP EDUCATORS WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO REVERSE THAT LOSS WHEN SCHOOLS REOPEN. THE REASON IN W. E. A STUDY THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLY EARLIER WHICH EVALUATED THE ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM MORE THAN FIVE MILLION STUDENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY OFFER SCARY PROJECTIONS ABOUT WHAT SCHOOL CLOSURES WILL MEAN FOR STUDENT LEARNING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MATCH. STUDENTS ARE LIKELY TO LOSE HALF OF THEIR USUAL MATH LEARNING GAMES AND IN SOME GRADES WILL FALL NEARLY A FULL YEAR BEHIND. READING IMPACTS ARE SOMEWHAT LESS PRONOUNCED BUT IN W. E. A. STILL PROJECTS STUDENTS WILLIAMS 30% OF A TYPICAL YEAR. THE STEPS WE TAKE NOW TO REVERSE LEARNING LOSS WILL DEFINE WHAT KIND OF STATE EMERGES. WILL WE ALLOW THE CRISIS TO FURTHER DIVIDE US OR WILL WE BAND TOGETHER TO GIVE EVERY CHILD REGARDLESS OF BACKGROUND IN EQUAL SHOT AT SUCCESS. THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM TODAY CAN HELP ENSURE THE LATTER. BY FIRST DIRECTING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RELEASE DISTANCE LEARNING PLANS. AND ALSO BY PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY FOR DISTRICTS TO ADDRESS LEARNING. AIR REQUIRING HIGH QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING FOR ALL STUDENTS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AS MENTIONED- EARLIER DEFINING HOW SCHOOLS SHOULD MEASURE STUDENT LEARNING DURING THIS CRISIS AND HOW THIS INFORMATION TO HELP STUDENTS CATCH UP ON MISSED MATERIAL. SO IN CONCLUSION ACROSS ALL OUR RECOVERY EFFORTS ONE COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLE MUST APPLY. AT THE MOST RESOURCES TO THE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IT THE HARDEST. YOU HEAR A LOT TODAY YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOS. FIRST YOU CAN WORK TO INVEST INVOLUNTARY MULTI WEEK SUMMER SCHOOL THIS YEAR ONLINE OR IN PERSON BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES. AND SECONDLY YOU CAN PARTNER WITH TEACHERS ACROSS THE STATE. TO IDENTIFY OTHER FORMS OF EXTENDED REQUIRE FINANCIAL RESOURCES SO WE WILL NEED TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL DOLLARS AND PROTECT STATE EDUCATION FUNDING. ROUTE THE PROCESS ADDRESS LESS IS HERE TO HELP THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OUR LAST ANALYST WILL BE LEAH THERE I'M FROM THE CALIFORNIA HE'S BEEN JOKING MYSELF LEE AT THE ERROR WITH pAFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND FELLOW PANELISTS CALIFORNIA STATE PTA IS WORKING HARD ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP FAMILIES AND STUDENTS STILL CONNECTED FOR IT DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND SHELTER ORDER HE OFTEN PLAYS A ROLE IN BUILDING COMMUNITY ADVOCATING FOR STUDENTS AT ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES AND CONNECTING PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS TO RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN. WE JUST RELEASED A FREE RESOURCE LIBRARY ON OUR CA PTA DOT ORG WEBSITE. I WOULD LEARNING ACTIVITIES THAT PARENTS CARE GIVERS AND STUDENTS CAN ACCESS TO SUPPORT LEARNING AT HOME. DURING THIS CRISIS WE'RE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED WITH STUDENTS SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING. WELL DISTRICTS ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING WE KNOW THERE ARE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM IN WHICH STUDENTS MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY DEVICES. INTERNET ACCESS OR QUIET PLACE TO LEARN. WE SUPPORT EDUCATORS AND BELIEVE THEY NEED AND DESERVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. I THINK MORE THAN EVER WE REALIZE THE VALUE OF OUR TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA. I FOR THE- FIRST. WILL NEED. ENGLISH LEARNERS STUDENTS WITH ID PEAS FIVE ABOARD AND SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO SUCCEED IN THIS NEW LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. WE HEARD FROM PARENTS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ENSURING THEIR STUDENTS ST GRADE LEVEL I DID NOT EXPERIENCE LEARNING OFFICE. OUT WAY I'M THE PARENT OF A HIGH SCHOOLER AND I'M OBSERVING THE CHALLENGES PARENTS ARE FACING BOUNCING WORKING FROM HOME CHILDREN IN PLACE AND SUPPORTING MY DAUGHTER'S LEARNING AT HOME EVERYTHING FROM BALANCING USE WIFI. DEVICES AT A QUIET PLACE IN OUR OWN HOME AND I ONLY MANAGING ONE STUDENT AND THREE ADULTS WORKING FROM HOME. MOST PROFOUNDLY I AM SEEING IMPACTS OF THE SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LACK OF GENUINE CONNECTION THAT THIS NEW NORMAL REQUIRES. MOST OF MOST OF ALL OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES NEED TO FEEL SAFE. AND SECURE THE FACE THE CHALLENGES THIS CURRENT PANDEMIC REQUIRES ABOUT. AND IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAKE THE DECISION TO INVEST IN C. D. MENTAL HEALTH. EDUCATION SERVICES AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROTECT OUR MOST VALUED ASSET IN THE STATE OUR CHILDREN. OKAY THANK YOU THAT. NOW WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JESSICA HOMES AND MAYBE YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT THE GOVERNOR JUST MADE ABOUT SCHOOLS REAL OPENING THIS SUMMER SO WE DON'T WANT TO STEAL HIS THUNDER BUT NOW IT'S ALL ACROSS THE- TWITTER WORLD. SO YOU CAN YOU CAN SHARE WITH US WHAT WHAT HE SAID AS WELL. THANK YOU- SO I DIDN'T HAVE I'M JUST HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON ANY FISCAL AT THE SCHOOL CONCERNS FOLKS HAD ABOUT- THE TOPIC OF THIS PANEL BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR DID JUST ANNOUNCE THAT- WE ARE. LOOKING WE ARE CONSIDERING- OPTIONS TO MITIGATE LEARNING LOSS- SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERING- AN EARLY. START OF THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR NO DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BUT IT IS- A TOPIC OF. DISCUSSION WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION SOMETHING WE CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON- BUT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE QUITE A BIT OF PREPARATION TO BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR THE PHYSICAL. AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES NECESSARY- FOR BOTH SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE CENTERS TO OPEN SAFELY- SO I NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THAT RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S- TRYING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT WORK. I'M LOOKING AT MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AND- EXPLORING WITH WITH YOU ALL IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY WHAT THAT MEANS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO I THINK THAT KIND OF ELUDES TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THERE'S WAY MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. RELATED TO THIS PIECE- I REGARDLESS WHETHER OR NOT THAT SCHOOLS CAN START EARLIER IN THE YEAR WE HAVE A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEY'RE NOT ALL. ON THE ON THE SAME PATH- BUT THE LEARNING LAS ISSUES. ARE ARE REAL IF YOU START IN JULY OR THE TRADITIONAL AUGUST OR AFTER LABOR DAY ESPECIALLY WAS HAPPEN THE LAST. TWO MONTHS- SO WITH THAT WILL NOW GET INTO- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AND WE DO WANT TO NOTE FOR OUR MEMBERS THAT- LINDA DARLING HAMMOND FROM THE TO STATE PARK- BOARD OF ED. THESE LEAVE A LITTLE BIT SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR HER. WE CAN PLEASE ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS TO HER AT THE OUTSET. I KNOW MISTER GALLAGHER WE LOST YOU- LAST TIME IN YOUR QUESTION SO YOU YOU CAN GO AHEAD WITH THOSE RIGHT NOW IF YOU'D LIKE. WELL I THINK SINCE WE HAVE HE NEED TO GO PRETTY SOON MAYBE WE CAN START THE. NOT TAKE MORE THAN THAT SORRY. I MEAN FIRST I THIS ONE I THINK WE GOT A SET THE TONE HERE A LITTLE BIT AND WE'VE KIND OF ALLUDED TO IT IN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN SPECIFIC ANSWERS- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE STILL ASSESSING THE SITUATION BUT OTHERS HAVE ACTUALLY ALREADY ASSESSED WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT INCLUDING THE LA JOH. AND ESTIMATES FOR JUST THIS YEAR THIS BUDGET YEAR- COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM FIVE BILLION TO TWENTY FIVE. TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AN ESTIMATED GENERAL FUND REVENUE DECLINE. IN NEXT YEAR THE LA- IS PROJECTED JUST LOOKING AT CAPITAL GAINS REDUCTIONS WERE LOOKING AT A THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. A GENERAL FUND A KLEIN- PROBABLY THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS GONNA BE MEASURED USING TEST ONE. WHICH REALLY MEANS FOR EVERY FUND REVENUE FORTY CENTS IS GONNA COME OUT OF. THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THAT'S THE REALITY- SO WE ARE FACING IN. YOU KNOW HUGE BUDGET SHORTFALLS- IN TERMS OF THE MONEY AVAILABLE- THERE'S DIFFERENT ME OBVIOUSLY THERE'S FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S COMING THROUGH THERE'S SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BUT- I DON'T THINK UNDER ANY SCENARIO. ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THE EXACT SAME FUNDING THAT WE WERE PLANNING ON AND- AND TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE FUNDING IN ADDIS I'D HAVE TO SAY WHERE WE GONNA GET THAT FROM. IN HERE. AND THIS IS THE OTHER THING WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. THE LONGER THAT WE STAY CLOSE DOWN ON A STATE WIDE ORDER. AND I AND I UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WE TAKE THOSE VERY SERIOUSLY BUT THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS AS WELL. AND IT'S IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IT'S IN OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET ALL OF WHICH YOU'RE LOOKING A HUGE CUTS- AND SO THE LONGER THAT WE STAY UNDER. A BLANKET ORDER AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS FREE OPENING THIS PROBLEM JUST GETS WORSE THE AT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE. COMING INTO. OUR PUBLIC COFFERS TO PROVIDE ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. IS GOING TO THAT PICTURE IS JUST GOING TO GET. WORSE SO I THINK WE DO ON THE ONE HAND HE TO BE LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE SAFELY RE OPEN AS MUCH OF THE ECONOMY. SAFELY OPEN AS MUCH OF THE ECONOMY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN GET. OUR REVENUES BACK A. AND I ALSO THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HE WAS MY COLLEAGUE. FROM SANTA BARBARA JUST MENTIONED HOW. IT YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE PLAN ON DISTANCE LEARNING ME IN THE LONG TERM WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE GET. THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THIS PANEL IS TO GET KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL- YEAH I REALIZE IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT DYNAMICS AND INVOLVED WITH THAT- BUT IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION THAT'S COMING OUT INCLUDING A REPORT THAT CAME OUT FROM AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE. ONCE YOU GET TO A AT A PERIOD WHERE YOU'VE HAD FOURTEEN DAYS OF DECLINING CASES THEY RECOMMEND THAT YOU CAN OPEN FACILITIES INCLUDING SCHOOLS SO I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT THAT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. AND SEE WHERE IT SAY TO DO SO WITH PROTOCOLS- TO GET KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MITIGATE THE LEARNING LOS THAT'S GOING ON- AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T I MEAN I THINK THE FISCAL PICTURE. WE CAN'T MAKE PROMISES- YEAH THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO INVEST IN ALL KINDS OF STUFF TO HELP MAKE DISTANCE LEARNING WORK. I DO I DON'TSEE WHERE THE MONEY IS. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN- CERTAINLY WANT TO TRY AND MITIGATE THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE INTERIM BUT WE NEED TO GET DO WHAT WE CAN TO GET PEOPLE BACK IN SCHOOL- WHERE WE CAN. CONTINUE THE EDUCATION THAT THESE KIDS. YOU KNOW SO DESPERATELY NEED. YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I MEAN YEAH YOU WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT COLA I WAS ANSWER FOR YOU I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN POSSIBLY DO A CALL INCREASE WITH THESE KIND OF NUMBERS SO IF. I'M JUST GONNA ASSUME THE ANSWER IS NO UNLESS YOU TELL ME DIFFERENT. IN TERMS OF THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE I WOULD ASK IS IT STILL YOUR PLAN TO KEEP IT AT. IS IT STILL YOUR PLAN TO KEEP IT AT THE THAN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT LEVELS THAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE BUDGET WHICH MIGHT BE ABOVE THE PROP NINETY A MINIMUM GUARANTEE UNDER TEST ONE- BUT TO BE GOOD TO KNOW THAT IS THAT IS THAT YOUR PLAN TO DO THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH I MISTER GALLAGHER SO. AGAIN AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE'RE STILL ANALYZING WHAT RESOURCES WE DO HAVE AVAILABLE- ONCE WE- IDENTIFY THAT AMOUNT WE PUT TOGETHER PLAN WHICH OF COURSE WE PROVIDE TO YOU AS THE ME REVISION- AND THAT WILL INCLUDE- OUR DECISIONS AROUND. HOW WE'RE FINDING THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE- I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING- THAT I'M NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU AN EXACT ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. WERE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THE ENTIRE PACKAGE AND HAVE THAT HOLISTIC LOOK AS ROOMMATE JUST SIT INS AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT OUT ANY INCORRECT INFORMATION- THAT WILL CONFUSE- THE PUBLIC SO- YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD I TO GET YOU GUYS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- BUT WE'RE NOT SURE- WHAT THE GUARANTEES GONNA LOOK LIKE AT THIS POINT. BUT DEFINITELY LOOKING FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THAT CONVERSATION ON THE REVISION. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT UNTIL THEN I MEAN SINCE WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT PROP NINETY IT'S GONNA GET CALCULATED USING TEST ONE AND THAT MEANS YOU KNOW EVEN IF IT'S A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR DECLINE IN REVENUE. A GENERAL FUND REVENUE THAT MEANS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR DECREASE IN- THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM FUNDING GUARANTEE. I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO ASSUME UNTIL I HEAR SOMETHING SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH WELL LET ME JUST INTERJECT THERE MISTER TAYLOR I THINK AS YOU SAID JUST NOW IS IT AS CHAIR BUDGET CHAIRMAN TING LUTES EARLIER WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC AND CAN'T BE. YOU KNOW HI THIS GUY IN HAVE A REALITY CHECK CONVERSATION. THEY CAN BE NEW MONEY ABOVE THE COAL THAT WE CAME OUT IN JANUARY PROBABLY NOT THE CAN WE KEEP THE COAL IS THE AMOUNT THAT WE HAD THERE IN JANUARY. THAT I THINK IS REALISTIC EVEN WITH THOSE. THOSE NUMBERS YOU TALK ABOUT IN LESS REVENUE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THREE. TOOLS A THREE LEGGED STOOL IT'S FEDERAL MONEY WE GOT ONE. A LOT IN THE FIRST FEDERAL CARES. SCHOOL CARES RIGHT YEAH THE CARES ALLOCATION WE'RE TRYING TO GET AROUND TO WE HAVE CERTAINLY ONE TIME MONEY THAT WE- STATE RESPONSIBLY PUT AWAY. NORTH OF TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AND POTENTIALLY ARE THINGS WE CAN DO LIKE DEFERRAL SO. I THINK WE SHOULD BE OPTIMISTIC AND TALK ABOUT HOW THAT SHOULD BE OUR TOP GOAL IS TO ADOPT A BUDGET WITH NO CUTS. NO CUTS AND EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE THIS DID THIS DRASTIC IMPACT GOING FROM THE ECONOMY. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE ARE THINGS IN PLACE. TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE TO OUR KIDS INTO OUR SCHOOLS. RIGHT AND I'M ANGRY I WANT TO TRY AND KEEP THINGS AS EVEN. KILLED AS POSSIBLE. BUT I ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S IN TENNIS WITH THE MAY REVISE AND. REAL QUICK- EVEN GET TO THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. YOU KNOW WHICH- RIGHT NOW HAS SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN IT. I THINK IN REALITY IT'S CLOSER TO FOURTEEN BILLION. YOU WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN THIS YEAR- IN TERMS OF THE BALANCE. WHAT WE CAN'T WE PROBABLY CAN'T USE ALL OF THAT IN ONE YEAR BECAUSE WE ARE PROBABLY LOOKING AT A CONTINUED RECESSION. AND THE FUTURE YEARS BUT WHAT IS THE GOT WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE CONDITIONS OR LIMITS. OPERATIVE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE OPTIONAL DEPOSIT BALANCES IN THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. AND YOU CONSIDER ANY FUNDS IN THE BSA TO BE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO SUPPORT REVENUES. SO AGAIN AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A BROKEN RECORD HERE BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SPEAK TO RIGHT NOW- DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WILL COVER WITHIN THE NAY REVISION. WELL LOOK I MEAN IT'S I MEAN IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE OBVIOUSLY PLANNING. YOU HAVE TO PLAN FOR THIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME IDEA. AND IT IS CONTINUED FRUSTRATION TO ME THAT YOU WON'T SHARE THAT PLAN YOU WON'T SHARE THAT THOUGHT HE WON'T SHARE ANYTHING. PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WE ARE PART OF THIS DECISION MAKING PROCESS OBVIOUSLY. WE HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT THE CHAIRMAN JUST SAID HOW CAN WE TRY TO KEEP THIS AS STABLE AS POSSIBLE- YOU OVER THE NEXT YEAR. BUT IT'S REALLY HARD WHEN WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY COOPERATION- SO. I DON'T KNOW I MEAN AS SOON AS WE CAN GET SOME ANSWERS THAT BE GREAT. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER. AGAIN THIS PANEL. WE WENT A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES AT AT IN GREATER DETAIL EARLIER I KNOW. YOU WANTED TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED HERE BUT HERE WE HAVE OUR PANELISTS FOCUSING ON THE- LEARNING LAS WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO TO MITIGATE THE LEARNING LOS ONE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCED LAST HALF OUR IS THAT. POSSIBILITY NOT A GUARANTEED THAT WE COULD START SCHOOL EARLIER TO MITIGATE THAT LOST BUT EVEN IF WE DID. THAT THEY'RE STILL THE LOSSES HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND SO. ON I WANTED TO START% OUT IN ASKING- LINDA DARLING HAMMOND AND ANY OF THAT- SCHOOL DISTRICT REPRESENTS OR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO- TO PIPE IN HERE- WHAT WHAT IT LOOK LIKE AND I KNOW WE HAVE A THOUSAND DISTRICTS ACROSS. CALIFORNIA VERY DIFFERENT RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN WHAT HAVE YOU- SO ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL BUT ONE THING THAT WE'VE BEEN TOSSING AROUND AS HAVING- A BLOCK GRANT WHICH COULD BE. A UNIVERSAL FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON KIDS THAT ARE VERY. IT VERY FAR BEHIND OR IT- MISTER O'DONNELL MENTIONED TO ME EARLIER THIS MORNING- KIDS THAT ARE JUST RIGHT THERE BUT THEY HAD A LOSS I LEARNING LAS WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM UP TO SPEED THING GRADUATE GOING TO COLLEGE AND SO. WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO PROVIDE RESOURCES RIGHT NOW TO DEAL WITH WHAT WE ARE FACING. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ALL I THINK YOU WERE ANTICIPATING- I THINK FIRST OF ALL A LOT OF DISTRICTS ARE IN THE GROOVE ON THE DISTANCE LEARNING THAT THEY'RE DOING AT HE MOMENT I AM PICKING UP STEAM AND WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO CONTINUE AS SOON AS IT IS SAFE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE TO BEGIN TO OPEN UP FACILITIES THAT I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT THE CRITERIA FOR THAT AND I THINK THE NEXT THING THAT WE CAN DO IS SUPPORT. OF BOTH THROUGH THE CARES ACT WHICH ALLOWS FOR THEIR SEND IN WHATEVER OTHER WAYS ARE POSSIBLE- FUNDING FOR SUMMER SCHOOL AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST IN THE STATE TO ENABLE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES- DISTRICTS MAY BRING TOGETHER SMALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS OF FOR TARGETED WORK ON YOU KNOW PARTICULAR- AREAS OF THE CURRICULUM MORE SKILLS AND THEY MAY DO A COMBINATION OF A DISTANCE LEARNING AND- IN PERSON LEARNING THERE ARE SOME COUNTY OFFICES DEVELOPING A STRONG. RESOURCES FOR OUR ONLINE OF SUMMER SCHOOL LEARNING AS WELL AS FOR IN PERSON. THERE ARE CERTAIN KINDS OF- STRATEGIES SPECIFIC TO LITERACY DEVELOPMENT. SPECIFIC TO- MATH. DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE WELL BEDDED AND CAN BE- MADE AVAILABLE TO. YOUR DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS THAT WANT TO USE THEM. I THINK IF THERE BE A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN APPROACH IT THAT. IT DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT PLACES WHATEVER WE DO IN PERSON WILL HAVE TO HAVE SOCIAL DISTANCING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO OF WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY. A RE OPENED SCHOOLS OR MAINTAINED SCHOOLS OPEN THAT WILL- WE ALSO CHILD CARE FACILITIES ARE USING SOME OF THOSE STRATEGIES ALREADY AND SO THAT MAY MEAN THAT WE CAN'T. ACCOMMODATE. CLASSROOMS FOR FOLKS SITTING CLOSE TOGETHER BUT OF TYPICALLY IN SUMMER SCHOOL THERE ARE SMALLER GROUPS. AS PART OF IT SO WILL BE A GOOD TEST CASE FOR THE HYGIENE AND SPACING AND- CLEANING STRATEGIES THAT WILL BE NEEDED IN THE SCHOOL YEAR ASSUMING WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BY THEN TO FULL SCHOOL OPENING. ANYBODY ELSE WANT. QUESTION IS IF WE DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUDGET TO PROVIDE OF COURSE WANT TO COVER THE BASIC FUNDING INCLUDING. THE PROPOSE COLA FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IF WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A- OUT LEARNING LAS BLOCK GRANTS. THROUGH THE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE TO HELP THE DEAL WITH THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE NOW SO YOU KNOW USUALLY WE PASSED THE BUDGET WE GIVE RESOURCE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION NO OFFENSE DEPARTMENT OF THAT IT TAKES FOUR MONTHS TO GET THE R. P. TOGETHER. SENATE OUT IN NOVEMBER APPLICATIONS COMMAND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SEVENTH EIGHTH MONTH AT THE FISCAL YEAR BEFORE WE STARTED SO THE IDEA HERE IS WE- PUT SOME MONEY TOGETHER AND WE WANT TO START RIGHT DAYS AFTER THE JULY ONE FISCAL YEAR TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT. LOOK THERE I'VE TALKED SO MY COLLEAGUES AND THEY SAY. 50% THE KIDS HAVING FOUND THEM HAVEN'T THEY BEEN CALL ON THE OTHER OVER THERE AT THAT CAN GIVE THEM CHROMEBOOKS AND HOT SPOTS AND SO FOR THAT I AM IN AROUND AND SO. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT REALITY AS WELL SO. IF WE WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE AND HOW CAN WE CREATE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD START. JULY ONE RIGHT AWAY TO HELP DEALING WITH- BUT WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS LEARNING LOS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIANS SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I DON'T WANT TO OUR PREEMPTS THE CD RESPONSE ON HOW THEY WOULD GET THE MONEY AT THE DOOR BUT I'LL JUST NOTE THAT- SOME YEARS AGO WE HAD A SUMMER SCHOOL OF EXPECTATION IN PART OF MONEY. IT WAS VERY EASY FOR DISTRICTS TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF EDUCATION FOR THIS MANY KIDS APPLICATION WAS SIMPLE THE FUNDING WAS CUED UP AND READY TO GO SO OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T NEED TO- TAKE. A LONG TIME TO DO THAT IF THERE IS A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE THAT PEOPLE AND- SIMPLY FEED INTO. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THIS IS STERILE CAMP AGAIN I'M NOT MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE FLEXIBILITY IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF A BLOCK GRANT TO MITIGATE THAT LEARNING OFFICE HAPPENING NOW I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE FLEXIBILITY AS YOU MENTIONED THAT THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS CALIFORNIA ALL OF US ARE AT DIFFERENT PLACES SOME OF US PROBABLY HAVE PLANS THAT HAVE THE WHOLE SUMMER SCHOOL DURING STOP WHEN HE TWENTY I SOME OF US WERE REDUCING SUMMER SCHOOL FOR TWENTY TWENTY DUE TO THAT THE FISCAL CRISIS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CRISIS. AND SO I WOULD LIKE IT'S THE IF THERE'S A BLACK GRANT SOME TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY WHERE WE GETNOT JUST THINK ABOUT SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY I MANY OF OUR STUDENTS WILL BE WITH US FOR MULTIPLE SCHOOL YEARS AND THAT'S WHERE SETTING THEIR LEARNING NEEDS A MOVING FORWARD I WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT CATCHING UP IN IN MITIGATING SUMMER LAW YES CURRENT ART IT AGAIN IN THE LEARNING LOS JUST DURING THE SUMMER AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY WOULD BE HURTS YOU CAN YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MITIGATE SUMMER LEARNING LOSS FOR YEARS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR. AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE AND IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OFF THE TABLE AS WE ADJUST TO OUR OUR NEW NOR THE ONCE AGAIN FLEXIBILITY I THINK WOULD BE. WOULD BE. OKAY PARTY THIS. TO BORED ALL. OUT WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE STARTING THAT ARE YEAR ROUND SCHOOLS. IN THEY ACTUALLY START MIDDLE JULY SO THAT FLEXIBILITY WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- DURING A TIME WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR BREAKS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY OFFER EXTRA LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STUDENTS DURING THAT MONTH OP WHEN THEY HAVE THAT TIME. SO WE WERE JUST TO SAY IT'S GOING TO BE JUST OVER. THE SUMMER TIME. THAT WOULD NOT HELP THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THE YEAR ROUND SETTING ARE READY. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STARTING UP THE SCHOOL YEAR EARLIER. IF WE START SOME SCHOOLS START ALREADY IN JULY. YOU'RE TALKING JUNE IN JUNE IS A SOMEWHAT THE WAY AND THEY AND SCHOOLS JUST DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN. AND THE EDUCATORS CAN'T PUT THE INPUT AND THAT'S- NOR TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL. SO THE FLEXIBLE IS GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT. AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER WE DO YOU JUST MAKE SURE THE EDUCATORS PARENTS ARE AT THE TABLE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE- BEST FOR STUDENTS. HEATHER HELP WITH A I THINK IT ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO HIGHLIGHT. SO YOU THE SAME ACTION. ANY AND AT RIGHT RIGHT I'M NOT HERE I KNOW I THINK MOST ANECDOTAL AT A WIDE. A EIGHT WHAT RIGHT YOUR- AND YOU OFFER A- ON YOU NEED BETTER ARTICLE THANK YOU BOTH AND THEIR IN. THERE ARE GREAT OF WHAT YOU HAVE OVER MONTHS RIGHT NOW AT HOW. BEEN ABLE I ACCESS. SO THAT THAT IN MONEY IN REALLY REACHING WARMER. YEAH AND HOW LONG HAVE A THIS IS ALICIA I THINK ONE OF THE IS GOING TO AND WITH BLACK GRANTS TO MAKE SURE THE ALLOCATIONS ARE WAITED TO ENSURE TO HEATHER'S POINT THAT THE STUDENTS WHO NEED THE SUPPORT AND THE DISTRICTS SENDING THE MOST SUPPORT ARE GETTING THOSE RESOURCES- AND ENSURING THAT THOSE ALLOCATIONS ARE WAITED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THAT HAPPENS. OKAY THANK YOU I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL OUR EDUCATION SHARED TALK ABOUT AS WELL BUT JUST. I SAID EARLIER AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN THIS IS AT A TOP PRIORITY AT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE ALSO. THE ASSEMBLY IS TRYING TO. COME UP WITH A BUDGET THAT KEEPS US RECALL BUT RECOGNIZE EVEN HOLE WE'VE HAD SOME DAMAGE ACROSS CALIFORNIA SOME STUDENTS ARE REALLY BEHIND. AND AS WE SEE FROM THEIR RESEARCH FROM THAT TRUST WES IT'S- CERTAINLY IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WE KNOW THAT IT'S EVEN WORSE AND SO WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL THAT AND TRY TO PROVIDE. FLEXIBILITY AS WE HEARD JUST NOW FOR DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS THIS- BEFORE KIDS GET BACK AT IT THIS FALL ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL. YES AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST WITH REGARD TO YOUR YOUR DISCUSSION OF SUMMER SCHOOL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE JUST SITTING HERE TODAY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL- SUMMER SCHOOL IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST STARTING THE SCHOOL YEAR EARLY- WHY. BECAUSE A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I THINK OF CREDITS I THINK OF CREDIT. DEFICIENCY AND I THINK OF GPA. SO I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT SUMMER SCHOOL SOME FOLKS ARE JUST WORRIED ABOUT THOSE KIDS WHO ARE MAYBE CREDIT DEFICIENT AND WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE KIDS. BUT WE SHOULD ALSO- FOCUS ON THOSE STUDENTS AND A KIND OF THE WATER. THEY MIGHT NEED TO BUMP UP THEIR GPA A BET TO GET INTO COLLEGE NEXT YEAR. OR THE YEAR AFTER- SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE GONE TO CREDIT NO CREDIT- THAT'S OKAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I OWN LOCAL DISTRICT AT THAT BUT NEXT DOOR DOWNEY. I THINK THEY HAVE IT WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY WANT TO CREDIT NO CREDIT AND THEN STUDENT CAN CHOOSE TO BE GRADED. IF THEY SO DESIRE BUT WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT FOR SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE. ARE REALLY YOU DON'T TRY TO PUSH THEIR GPA UP AND GET INTO A CERTAIN COLLEGE THEY NEED. THE GPA NUMBERS THEY DON'T NEED A CREDIT NO CREDIT THEY'RE GOING TO PASS. BUT THEY NEED THE GPA NUMBER SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE OF ENCOURAGE MY OWN. QUITE FRANKLY TO- TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WELL WHAT I'LL CALL THE DOWNEY MODEL SOME DISTRICTS ALREADY MIGHT BE IMPLYING THAT MODEL AS WELL. IN FACT I THINK THEY ARE WITH REGARD TO ACCESS AND CONNECTIVITY. I THOUGHT I HEARD THE NUMBERS REFLECTED THAT YOU KNOW FOR HER THOUSAND STUDENTS DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ONLINE LEARNING BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THE DEVICE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE- THE- THE HOT SPOT WHATEVER IT MAY BE THOSE NUMBERS ARE LARGE BUT REMEMBER WE DO HAVE SIX WHAT SIX POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I WE CERTAINLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THOSE THOSE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WE HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM IS REALLY A SOCIAL PROBLEM BEYOND- CONNECTIVITY IS NOT SUCH A TANGIBLE PROBLEM AGAIN AS IT IS A SOCIAL PROBLEM AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. HANDING OUT DEVICES AND THEN THE KIDS NEVER GET ON THEM- BECAUSE OF SITUATIONS AT HOME SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE THE ADDRESS US WE JUST CAN'T POINT IT HANDING OUT COMPUTERS AS THE SOLE SOLUTION THAT SEEMED LIKE PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR SURE. AND THAT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU I ONE BY ONE OF OUR HIGH SCHOOLS THERE WAS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN LINE AND THEY WERE ALL GETTING COMPUTERS. BUT THE NEXT STEP IS THEY NEED TO ACCESS THE ONLINE LEARNING FROM FROM HOME AND I REALIZE OUR SITUATIONS OR THAT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AND THAT IS WHAT HOW IDENTIFY THE SOCIAL PROBLEM OF THAT- WHAT ELSE DID I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HERE- AND THEN RE OPENING SCHOOLS WE TALK ABOUT RE OPEN THE SCHOOLS I HOPE WE PAY ATTENTION THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. CERTAINLY IN PEOPLE BUT ALSO IN GEOGRAPHY- IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RE OPEN AND NOT SOMEOTHERS WE SHOULDN'T JUST HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH NO I'M NOT OUT OF THE ON BOARD WITH MR GALLAGHER'S APPROACH GOD LOVE HIM. BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT YOU THERE SO SCHOOL WORK DRIVE THEY GET THE BUST ON A BUS OR TO A- TO GET SCHOOL. AND SO. IN OF THE JUSTICE THERE THEY THEIR THEY'RE IN PLACE FOR THE SCHOOLS ARE VERY LARGE AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE- YOU KNOW ITREAL DENSE POPULATION WERE MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE SCHOOLS TO RE OPEN. EVERY DAY- AND IT MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATE IN A MORE URBAN AREA I DON'T HAVE. THE SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S ACTOR BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT IT SHOULDN'T BE JUST AGAIN. A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND JUST ONE QUESTION MAYBE FOR THE TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DEPARTMENTS CATION ARE WE GOING TO PROVIDE A SCHOOL MEALS THROUGH THE SUMMER IS THEIR PLAN TO DO THAT NOW. MAYBE SOMEONE COULD COMMENT ON THAT. AND THE CHAIRS IN HERE SO IF YOU COULD WEIGH IN. THE OTHER CHAIRS. THIS IS JUST GOT HOME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WILL DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO- DISCUSS THE SUMMER NUTRITION PROGRAMS THAT. ARE AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO WE'RE DEFERRING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE THEY STILL ON. YES THIS IS A CD EVEN YOU HAVE A SUMMER EMAIL PROGRAMS AND SO ON YES WE ARE WE ARE PLANNING TO CONTINUE OUR CURRENT. OUR GRANT. AND ALONG THOSE LINES WITH REGARD TO THE SERVER MEALS PROGRAM. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY DISTRICTS HAVE NOT SIGNED UP FOR THAT AND MAYBE WE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE DISTRICTS BECAUSE I. DID HAVE A SITUATION NEAR MY OWN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE IN THE THEY OPTED NOT TO PROVIDE THE MEALS AND THAT BECAME A REAL ISSUE FOR THE COMMUNITY THE KIDS WERE ACTUALLY GOING. DO YOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS RELATED TO THAT. WHAT WILL DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU WITH THOSE FIGURES AND AGAIN I WHEN I'D LIKE TO KNOW IT'S JUST SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE IT YOU MAY HAVE IT IS G. WHAT DISTRICTS HAVEN'T SIGNED UP MY UNDERSTANDING TO THE SUMMER MEALS PROGRAM IT COULD BE A LOCAL YMCA. THAT PROVIDES THOSE MEALS FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IN OTHER WORDS CAN BE NON ELEAZAR DO PROVIDE MEALS AS WELL SO THAT MAY BE THE OUTLET FOR THE MALES IN THAT COMMUNITY I WANNA BE SENSITIVE TO THAT FACT AS WELL SO WITH THAT IF YOU GIVE ME THAT INFORMATION TO BE MOST APPRECIATIVE I THINK I'M- TURNING BACK TO MISTER CHAIR. I GUESS I'M NOT. ONE SOMETHING FROM. MCCARTY ON. A REAL APPRECIATE. THE PANEL FOR. THEIR PRESENTATION IS THE FOR WHAT THE TO THAT WE BECAUSE- YEAH LET'S JUST CAUCUS HAVE PROBABLY SO OF THE- MOST BOY. CONVERSATION IS NOT HARD TO SEE WHY I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE DíAS I SEE LOT OF PARENTS A SCHOOL KIDS I THINK WE'VE- THIS. HAD THEM BECAUSE IN EVERY PARENT WITH CHILDREN IN SCHOOL WERE ALL. JUGGLING IT TO WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS AND ALL THE AND INCOME. I'M I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S- IS HI I SEE IF. YOU KNOW THE SUPER DOT CAN. SORT OF. SORT OF WAY. WHAT HIS WISH LIST IS THE NIGHT I'M HERE FROM MR BOARD SORT OF WHAT. WITH THIS A WHICH WAS IS IN A LOT OF. FINANCIAL FOR. IT'S IS WHICH ARE WHICH I THINK IS A- TO ASK FOR BUT WHAT I DON'T HE SEE ANY ANY OF THE- RECOMMENDATION ARE SOME OF. RECOMMENDED THAT A TRUST WORTH PUSH FOR WHICH IS SORT OF YOU KNOW HAVING SOME SOME SAY. HAVING SOME ACCOUNT OF HAVING SO. SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS AND I AND I WAS EVEN MORE BY THE OF IT RESPONSE OF WELL YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW GUIDELINE AWAY BUT GOVERNOR'S IT'S KINDA LIKE EVERY PERSON FOR THEMSELVES. AND NOT. UNDERSTAND ITS GREAT THAT- YOUR HOST AND WEBINARS BUT WEBINARS ARE NOT. VERY BASIC- GUIDELINES ARE IN FACT. YOUR RESPONSE WAS SO CONCERNING DOCTOR WEBER TEXT ME FROM SAN DIEGO BECAUSE SHE'S WATCHING THE HEARING RIGHT NOW YOUR YOUR TASK FORCE CULTURE. SO OF A SINCE WE COULDN'T WITH TALK ABOUT PANELIST LIST GO BACK TALK TO DEPARTMENT OF ED IS SORT OF LIKE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE OFFER GUY TO THEIR- DEPARTMENTS. AT WHAT POINT DO YOU DEVELOP SOME BASS LINES OF. INSTRUCTION UNDER. THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT. AND OFFER GUIDANCE DAHLE YOUR COUNTIES. THIS IS JULIE WELL AS DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATE YET THEY YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION WEEK WE HEAR YOU SIR AND YOU KNOW WE ARE WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT IS WORKING AS FAR AS I'M WORKING WITH DOCTOR WEBER AND OTHERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN FIGHT BETTER GUIDANCE AS OUR DOCTOR STEPHANIE GRAYSON MENTIONED BEFORE. WE ARE LOW CONSOLE STATE AND OF TRYING TO WORK CLOSE WITH THE KIND OFFICES EDUCATION TO PROVIDE THEM WITH GUIDANCE THAT THEY CAN BETTER SERVE CONCORD COPY THERE ARE YOUR WORLD LOCAL STATE THE WHITE WE HAVE THIS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OUR OUR OUR- HERE IN OUR POP YEARS AGO LITTLE SUPPLY. OUR SCHOOL AND OUR DISTRICT IN OUR COUNTY. OF THE STATUTE INTO. THAT WE ARE YOU WE ARE ABLE TO RUN UNDER SUPPORT. ARE YOU OFFERING THEM DURING THIS. PANDEMIC AND I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL WORKING. UNDER A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN WE WERE WORKING UNDER AN UNDER FEDERAL OUR SITE TO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THIS IS NEW TERRITORY. MY CONCERN. IS I DIDN'T HEAR HEY WE'RE DEVELOPING GUIDELINES HEY WE'RE DEVELOPING BASS LINES HEY WE'RE- DEVELOPING NEW ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPING TO OFFER BECAUSE THE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE. THE STAFFING THAT YOU DO TO DEVELOP THESE GUIDELINES THAT YOUR JOB. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING. TO OFFER AND I'M NOT CONCERNED I HAVE THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS PERSON HERE AFTER HAVING TO BE EDUCATE WHERE WHERE DID ALL THE EDUCATION EXPERTS GO. THAT HELPS. DEPARTMENT IS WORKING COLLABORATIVELY ACROSS VARIETY OF AREAS INCLUDING THE MOST TASK FORCE THAT. I LOOK AT YOU GOT HOUSE CAN BE A VARIETY OF ISSUE INCLUDING AS WE KNOW EARLIER THE LAW ISSUE WE THE DIGITAL. DIVIDE AS AS A MOBILE ISSUE WERE NOT AT WHAT GUY DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS WILL BE TO ENTER I RE OPEN OR EVEN SUMMER WELL SO WE ARE BE AND WE ARE WITH THE STATE OR ABOUT. I ALL THOSE BAD IN THOSE OF AREAS ALL A PART. EXPANDED LEARNING OUR EARLY EDUCATION CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS AND INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES DIVISION FISCAL THERE AS YOU KNOW IT IS A MULTIFACETED ISSUE SO EACH DECISION THAT REQUIRES US TO WORK IN CANADA SO WE ARE DOING THAT YOU'RE ALSO WORKING WITH. THE FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I WE HAVE CHAMPIONS STABBING ON THE RIGHT BASIS WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE PARTS. AND AGAIN WE'RE AND IT OUR EXTRA I PARTNERS. SO YOU WE ARE TO GUIDED WE DO HAVE GUIDED POSTED OUR WEBSITE THAT IS AS AS THEY ARE ELLIE EIGHTIES IN GETTING THROUGH WHAT YOU CALL THE E. IT NEEDS INCLUDING THAT SOME OF THE STATE AND WORK. AND WORK AND TO WORK A LOT OF OUR TO AS WELL TO US AND LIGHTED SO YES ANSWER YOUR WE ARE WORKING ON THAT AND I THINK THE IT'S A MARK AND WE'RE WORSE MISS GRAY. FOR ME FOR DISCUSSION FOR SO. AGAIN MY AND MY CONCERN IS I UNDERSTAND THE NEW NORM. IS ZOOM MEETINGS BUT LET'S NOT. LET'S NOT REPLACE ZOO MEETINGS WITH GUIDELINES OR ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS WHICH I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT IS IN CHARGE OF. IT IN ADDITION- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF DISCUSSION LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS LOT OF TALK. BUT LET US NOT CONFUSE THEIR FROM WE NEED SOME. GUIDELINES AND SOME ACTION SORT OF IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE- RIGHT RIGHT NOW HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU YOU CAN NOT. NOT ONLY IS THERE A LACK OF GUIDELINES. ACROSS DISTRICT THERE'S A LACK OF GUIDELINES WITHIN A DISTRICT. YOU KNOW THIRD THE THIRD GRADE IS NOT BEING TAUGHT THE SAME WAY BY EVERY THIRD GRADE TEACHER MY DISTRICT. I AM SURE THAT'S THE WAY IT IS AND DISTRICTS ALL. AROUND THE STATE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MAY BE OKAY FOR THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO JUST BECAUSE- THIS IS THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. BUT IT SHOULD IT SURE AS HECK CAN'T BE OKAY IF WE START SCHOOL IN JULY. AND A BETTER NOT BE OKAY FOR AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER- BECAUSE IT THIS IS THE- IF THIS IS THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE GOING BY WHAT IT WOULD JUST TAKE OFF. JUST DO A REGISTER YOUR LET'S JUST TAKE OFF YOUR- LET'S JUST LET'S JUST LET'S JUST. CALL WHAT IT IS. IF THEY'RE NO GUIDELINES IN EVERY EVERY EVERY TEACHER FOR HIM OR HERSELF. SO AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS SOME YOU KNOW. THIS IS EVEN MORE CONCERNING BECAUSE WHAT I'D HOPE IS AS A PARENT I WOULD FEEL REASSURED AFTER THIS PANEL AND I AM EVEN MORE. CONCERNED AFTERWARDS AND KNOWING THAT AGAIN THE STATE HAS DONE ITS JOB WE HELD DISTRICTS HARMLESS AND WE THINK WE KNOW WE HEARD THE WHOLE HATE TRUST US AND WE AND WE SAID YES WE TRUST YOU. WANNA HOLD EVERYBODY HARMLESS WE WANT TO KEEP EVERYONE GOING BUT THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY CONCERNING THAT IT'S LIKE WE'RE GOING INTO THE WILD WEST. AND SO EVERYBODY JUST GETS TO DO WHATEVER THE WHATEVER THE HECK THEY WANT AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE IF THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN YOU KNOW WHY DON'T WHY DON'T WE ALL JUST TAKE A YEAR OFF IN THE LIST LET'S COME BACK. LET'S COME BACK FOR THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO REGROUP. IS THAT IS THAT WERE. SEC AFTERNOON- THE SUSPECT A GREAT SIN REJOINING IN MY APOLOGIES WE HAD A VERY ANOTHER MEETING SCHEDULED IN FACT INTERVIEW SCHEDULED WORK IN AND IT'S YEARS HE- PRIOR TO KNOWING ABOUT THIS HEARING SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE HAD TO I HAD TO LEAVE AT NOON SO I AM GETTING BRIEFED VERY QUICKLY CAUGHT UP ON THE CONVERSATION I UNDERSTAND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM THERE'S CONCERNS AROUND THE ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHEN WE HAVE A- LOCAL CONTROL AND THAT YOU HAVE QUESTIONS AROUND TWO GUIDELINES FOR ACROSS THE STATE- ARE BASICALLY A STANDARD IS CHEN ACROSS THE STATE. FORCED YOU LEARNING IN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT IS THAT CORRECT ABSOLUTELY SALAS AGAIN JUST TO JUST TO BE CLEAR I KNOW WE HAVE- FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS LOCAL CONTROL THOSE PEOPLE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA I AM NOT AROUND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY- YOU KNOW I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE HAD- YOU KNOW EVERY EVERY. DISTRIBUTOR JUST DO WHATEVER THE- WHAT WHATEVER THEY WANT TO THAT WAS A MY JUST OF THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN THE STATE. SO IS A GHETTO. MY QUESTION WAS JUST JUST TO REITERATE IT WAS. WHAT WHAT GUIDELINES IS THE DEPARTMENT PUTTING FORWARD TO REALLY GIVE. GUIDANCE TO THE DISTRICTS WITH THE GIVE GUIDANCE TO THE COUNTIES. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WHICH WHICH I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC THIS IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY. IS NOT ONLY IS THERE NOT CONSISTENCY. ACROSS DISTRICT THERE'S NOT EVEN A DECIDED BECAUSE THIS IS THE WITHIN DISTRICTS AND HOW TEACHERS ARE TEACHING THIRD GRADE OR- A TEACHER TO TEACHER FOURTH GRADE. SO AT SOME POINT YOUR DEPARTMENT IN CHARGE OF. CREATING GUIDELINES ACCOUNTABILITY. INCONSISTENCIES SO WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE PUTTING OUT GUIDELINES SO IF IN FACT WE DO. START IN JULY OR AUGUST BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO START SCHOOL IN AUGUST IN SAN FRANCISCO. THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME. ACROSS THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS MULTI FACETED WE DO HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WE'VE HAD ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM ACROSS THE STATE OR SEVERAL YEARS YOU CAN SEE THAT ON OUR CALIFORNIA SHOOL DASHBOARDS. AND WE HAVE A STANDARDIZATION A LONG. MON AROUND WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE LEARNING AT THE END OF EACH GRADE LEVEL AND THE AT THE END OF THEIR SCHOOL CAREER WE HAVE. SINCE WE HAVE BEEN ON HOW TO HELP TEACHERS OF STUDENTS MEET THE STANDARDS WITH OUR CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS WE ALSO HAVE OUR ASSESSMENTS THAT SHOW US YOU WHERE STUDENTS. AND THEIR LEARNING AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO ENHANCE THEIR LEARNING AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE PROGRESSING TOWARDS THEIR- DOUBLE STANDARDS SO WE DO HAVE THE CAPABILITY ACROSS THE STATE. DURING THIS TIME I I'D LIKE TO REMIND US IS ONLY SIX WEEKS. AND DO WE ASKED TO OVER TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS TO PIVOT TO DISTANCE LEARNING. WE A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME THAT ALSO MEANS THAT WE'VE HAD TO ADAPT. OUR ASSESSMENT PIECE ARE YOU ARE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE- WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT STUDENTS ARE SAFE. AND SO DURING THIS TIME WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THAT GUIDANCE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT AROUND WHAT QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING LOOKS LIKE FOR EVERY STUDENTS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTY OFFICES AND WITHDISTRICTS SUPERINTENDENTS THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE SIX WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT THEM AND GET THEIR NEEDS MET. ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE AND THE DONATIONS FOR DEVICES THAT HAVE BEEN COMING IN. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE. OR THAT EVERY DISTRICTS NOW EVERY STUDENT IS GETTING WHAT THEIR NEEDS. NOW IT'S DIFFERENT. YEAH WE HAVE A TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. WITH A- AXE. AS A AND SO THAT THE- TO DO AS- BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AT THE COUNTY IS THAT WITH THE DISTRICT LEVELS WITH OUR LABOR AND MANAGEMENT PARTNERS. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT- I WOULD WE NEED TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE ALL HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY OR WHERE WERE ADDS IN THIS TIME. WE ALL HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. AND SO WHEN WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO INSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THAT QUALITY GUIDANCE AND EVERY STUDENTS BENEFITS. SO WITHOUT FOR A MISSING ON. THE FULL PICTURE MAYBE YOU CAN OFFER ME WHAT IS YOUR- DIGITAL LEARNING GUIDANCE THAT YOU ARE OFFERING IN TERMS OF YOUR YOUR- PRACTICE THAT YOU'RE ENCOURAGING. DISTRICTS TUB THOR COUNTIES TO LOOK AT. WE HAVE WEBINARS SEVERAL OF IN OUR CENTER WEBSITE THAT YOU CAN WATCH- ONE OF THEM IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE KEY PRINCIPLES IN DISTANCE LEARNING AND SHINNING COATS AND I DID THAT OURSELVES- WE DOING RESEARCH WITH OUR TEACHER PARTNERS ARE DISTRICT PARTNERS AND DISTANCE LEARNING EXPERTS AT FROM HARVARD AND YOU HAVE. A SEAT. AND SO THAT IS RESEARCH BASED IN AB IS EVIDENCE BASED SO ALL OF OUR GUIDANCE IS RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE BASED. AND THEN HOW DO HOW DO YOU ENSURE ASSUMING THAT- PERHAPS WE WILL BE DOING. THIS TYPE OF LEARNING WHEN THE SCHOOL YEAR STARTS IN THE FALL. OR MAYBE SOME HYBRID HOW DO YOU ENSURE SOME CONTINUITY. BETWEEN DISTRICTS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON CURRENTLY NOW AS DEVELOPING THAT CONTINUITY PLAN OF WHAT THAT HYBRID SITUATION COULD LOOK LIKE YEAH THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN- AS WELL AND WILDFIRES SO WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE ARE LEARNING FROM THIS PANDEMIC CAN. TRANSLATE INTO HOW WE SERVE STUDENTS DURING WILDFIRES IN PUBLIC SAFETY HOW ARE SHOT SHUTDOWNS SO WE ARE TAKING THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE LEARNED FROM WILDFIRES AND FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND WE WILL BE CREATING THAT PLAN OF CONTINUITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHEN DO YOU PLAN ON RELEASING THAT PLAN. I WILL BE WORKING WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER WEBER AND OUR PARTNERS AT C. T. EIGHT TOBY BLADE AND ARDS STAFF HERE AT C. D. E. AMONG OTHER TASK FORCE MEMBERS TO CREATE THAT PLAN WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT OUT THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER. IF NOT SOONER WHAT I'M SORRY WHAT DO YOU RIGHTS. SO SUMMER TECHNICALLY BEGINS WHAT THE THIRD WEEK OF JUNE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE- SAYING IS A TIME ONE. I NORMALLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT AND THEIR SCHOOL YEARS SECOND OR THIRD WEEK AS OF JUNE WE DO HAVE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT GOT OUT AT THE END OF MAY. SO WHEN YOU SAY BEGINNING OF SUMMER WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M SORRY. BEGINNING IN pTHEIR LOOK THE REASON THIS IS VERY CONCERNING IS AGAIN I KNOW WE'VE HAD TO ADAPT VERY QUICKLY- I APPLAUD EVERYBODY FOR BEING VERY VERY FLEXIBLE. BUT AGAIN- THAT CONCERN IS- THE- COMPLETE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS- ACROSS THE STATE AND IT'S VERY CONCERNING BECAUSE AGAIN- FOR ALL OF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON THE CHEAP GAS. THERE'S A CONCERT. FURTHER EXACERBATED WE WERE SEEING THE EQUITY GAP BE EXACERBATED IN TERMS OF WHO'S DYING FROM THIS DISEASE BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE TO GO TO WORK. AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE KIND OF PROTECTION- IN SEOUL THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONCERN THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT IT IS NOT SHOWING. THE SET OF GUIDELINES TO REALLY OFFER A BASELINE IN EVERYBODY CAN JUST KINDA DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WILL BE FULLY AWAITING YOUR GUARD BEGIN OF CHEN. I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK TO. SORT OF DOCTOR CAMP IN THEN TO THE DOCTOR ARE IAGO FOR SECOND IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR. AND JUST GOING TO THE DOCTOR CAMPAñA ME WHAT WE HAVE HERE. YOU KNOW WAIT WAIVERS ON MINIMUM SCHOOL DAYS WAIVERS ON MINUTES YOU KNOW ALL ALL THESE VERY THAT YOU KNOW THE FEW- BASELINE SORT OF EDUCATION GUIDELINES THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE CONSISTENCY IS MIKE'S DISTRICT HOW HOW IF WE IF WE DID WAIVE THESE HOW COULD WE BE AS A SURE OF THAT- YOU. STUDENTS WOULD BE GET. ORDER VIA A PROPER. QUALITY EDUCATION IN YOUR IN YOUR DISTRICT. WHERE ARE THE OTHER DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- I WHAT I'M FINDING RIGHT NOW IS THAT- NUMBER SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU JUST ADJUSTING TO OUR NEW DOOR. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN A HUGE FOCUS WITH MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS US GETTING THAT COULD THE CONNECTIVITY AND THE DEVICE IN THE HANDS OF THE STUDENT. I'M JUST PATCHING IN THE NEXT YEAR SO- WHAT I'M HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THAT IF WE'RE EXPECTED TO. SUPPORT THE EFFORT. L. STANDPOINT GONNA HAVE YOUR STUDENTS IN THE BUILDING AND AS WELL AS THAT WE HAVE TO GET SOME FLEXIBILITY AS AFGHAN STUDENTS I WILL NEED OPPORTUNITIES TO THE QUARANTINE I IF THEY TEST POSITIVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN OR IF THEY HAVE INTERACTIONS- SO GIVEN THAT I WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE FIELD IS THAT IT'S NOT SET UP A SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY SYSTEM. IT'S A VERY- WAS BIRD AT SOME TRYING TO TRACK OR QUALITY OUR WANNA FIGHT STUDENT WORK REDUCTIONS IN DAYS IN SCHOOL I JUST THINK GIVEN OUR OUR CIRCUMSTANCES. I HEAR FROM EDUCATED EVERY DAY THEY THEY'RE STRESSED ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN OVER THE CONTACT. THEIR ALSO STRESSED ABOUT CONTACT AND- HAVING A PRODUCTIVE USE OF TIME FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE ARE IN CONTACT WITH. US SO MY- I GUESS MY WARNING WOULD BE LET'S NOT CREATE ANOTHER SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO WEAR IS UP ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT THAT AT THIS GOOD THIS IS ARE AFRAID OF ACCOUNTABILITY BUT WE'RE WE'RE REALLY ADJUSTING. AND IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO THE DESIGN A SYSTEM ON PAPER THAT SAY THIS IS WHAT WE CLEARLY. EXPECT NOT ONLY FOR THE SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT FOR THE FAMILIES IF YOU'RE A FAN STILL HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME WITH COMPLETING WORK OR TENDING. TO THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAPPEN TO MEMBERS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HOME ARE WE AT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM GOING TO HOLD THE STUDENT FAMILY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS LIKE THE STUDENT ATTENDANCE REVIEW BOARD. AND I WHICH IS A VERY COMPETENT IN THEIR DOES ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND I THINK WE NEED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF REYES. AS WE TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES. BOB WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING TO HELP CRISIS AN ECONOMIC CRISIS FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES. AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK OUTSIDE OF OUR TRADITIONAL WAYS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY DURING THIS TIME- WE'RE GONNA LEARN. AT MY LAST. BE I THINK WE YOU LEARN A LOT WHEN THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE I ALWAYS MENTION ACCESS BECAUSE ACT THAT HAS THE- THE ABILITIES TO CONVENE. WE'RE OF. SCHOOL MANAGE DATERS VERY RAPID LEAD TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. OP THE I KNOW MY JOB AS A SUPERINTENDENT BUT I DON'T KNOW EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF SCHOOLS. AND A CANNOT. BE WITH INTENDED AND ALL THAT. ACCESO WITHOUT ABILITY TO COMPETE IN A GROUP THAT WOULD GO ON THESE ISSUES ON A DAY TO. I'M IN. I TO BEFORE WE- WHAT WHAT. TO BE GREAT I THINK IT I THINK LAW. I I'M DEFINITELY NOT ADVOCATE. MEASUREMENTS FOR TAPE SAY ON NOT LOOKING AT THAT. ALL WERE I AM CONCERNED AS YOU HEARD MY COMMENTS EARLIER IS. AGAIN I LOVE YOU TO ANSWER THIS YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO YOU INSURE FOR. FOURTH GRADE MATH IS TAUGHT. OBVIOUSLY NOT EXACTLY THE SAME BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERY TEACHERS DIFFERENT AND YOU KNOW TEACHERS HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU KNOW ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT HOW DO YOU ENSURE SOME CONSISTENCY SAY FOR FOURTH GRADE MATH ACROSS OUR DISTRICT OR FOR WHATEVER. WHAT WHATEVER SUBJECT HAVING SAID THIS KNOWING THAT WE HAVE- AS- DOCTOR HAMMOND SORT OF TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE A LOT OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEALTH ISSUE. WE HAVE OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES PAST. SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PICK UP SO MANY SOCIAL SERVICES. THAT TRADITIONALLY I COUNTIES OR OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES REALLY LED NIGHTIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO AN AMAZING JOB TOTALLY. FINE TO ADD THOSE AS PART OF YOUR- SORT OF FROM THE DELIVERABLES OR NOT MISTER ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS BUT JUST TO SAY HEY. WE'RE TAKING TIME OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. ARE IN THE SOCIAL MENTAL SPACE TO LEARNING IT IS FOR THEIR FAMILIES OKAY I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S TOTALLY FINE TO SAY HEY WE'RE TAKING TIME OUT. FOR THAT AND WE ARE. MAKING SURE WE'RE TAKING CARE FAMILIES THAT WAY. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU. INSURER A CERTAIN LEVEL OF- CONTINUITY ACROSS PETER SUBJECTS GRADES TEACHERS WITH THE IN YOUR DISTRICTS THE FEW THESE THAT I GET A FEW REQUIREMENTS WE ALREADY I MEAN WE HAVE CURRICULA AND THAT THAT- TRUTH DRIVES THAT THE HOW DO YOU- SORT OF A SURE. SURE THAT IF YOU'RE WAVING ALL THE GUIDELINES THAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO CONSIDER WHETHER. YEAH THAT'S A INTERESTING AND I DON'T WANT TO MIX THE TWO I'M SAYING ACCOUNTING OR- INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS OR INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES IT'S AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THAT WAS. SORTED EASILY DEFINED YOU KNOW STUDENT THE SCHOOL GET CREDIT FOR TEN OR ATTENDING SCHOOL SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE EACH TIME MAKE A STUDENT. THE TEN SCHOOL THAT THAT IN SOME SENSE IS A VERY EASY ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THE MORE- CONVERSATION IS. IT'S REALLY IT'S NOT A CONVERSATION THAT ABSENT OF THE OPTICAL BIT NINETEEN CONVERSATION. THE REALITY IS WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT AND DEVELOPING SYSTEMS I HAVING CURRICULUM GUIDES HAVING MONITORING SYSTEM DEVELOPING LOCUSTS. MINOR STUDENT. LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE OR WE STILL HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT PROGRESS A PERFORMANCE IN PROGRESS SO THOSE. THOSE WITH STILL BE IN EXISTENCE. ONE OF THE STRUGGLE THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT MIGHT HAVE IS IF YOU WERE LOCALLY AS THINGS DO YOUR OFFICE THAT MESSAGE. IS BETTER AND THE STANDARDS IN THE- AND OF A STUDENT PROGRESS AND. AT THE WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE AND I DISTANCED OF OUR WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE STILL HAVEN'T IS A ABOUT U. S. STUDENT. I IF YOU'RE A TO DO. OR IF YOU HAVE TO CHEN YOUR ASSESSMENT MEN. SO ONCE AGAIN THE OLDER TWO DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS AND BOTH ARE IMPORTANT. BUT I HEAR FROM TEACHERS I HAVE A- TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR OUR OUR TEACHERS AND THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'M HEARING ARE A AS A PERTAINS TO THIS YEAR THE NINETEEN TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR IS. A WHAT WHAT WHAT WERE THOSE ESSENTIAL STANDARDS THAT WE INTENDED TO TEACH DURING THE LATTER PART OF THIS YEAR AND IS IT WAY THAT WE CAN. STONE THAT UP ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT AND MAYBE IT I GIVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN THAT. THAT DIDN'T AT. IF THE STUDENT DID NOT LEARN THOSE STANDARDS DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. SO THOSE ARE THE CONVERSATION THAT I HEAR TEACHERS HAVE BEEN RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN EXTREME INTEREST IN. MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE LEARNING RELEASED EXPOSED TO AT THE VERY LEAST TO THE STANDARDS THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE EXPOSED TO. THE PARTICULAR YEAR THAT THEY'RE IN SCHOOL. SO ONCE AGAIN- DIFFERENT THE ACCOUNTABILITY I JUST I DON'T WANT TO DEVELOP A WHOLE DIFFERENT. WAY OF A COUNTY FOR UNITS BEING THERE IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S GONNA BE A DISJOINTED. CATION LEAVE WELL HE DID IT COMMON THIS GOAL DAYS A WEEK. AND A YOU KNOW IT OR IF THEY DO THEY WON'T BE THERE DURING THE THIS FIVE OR SIX HOURS THAT THEY THEY ARGUE EVERY SCHOOL DAY. THAT WAS MY MAIN POINT IN IN. RECOMMENDATIONS GOT A GUN THAT AND THAT'S A POINT WELL TAKEN BUT JUST GOING BACK TO MY QUESTION SO. HOW HOW DO YOU ENSURE CONSISTENCY. ACROSS TWO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN YOUR DISTRICT. YET TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A CURRICULUM GUIDE AND WE HAVE A CURRICULUM GUIDE IN IN THE TEACHERS ARE MEETING- MULTIPLE YEARS- HAND THERE. THEY HAVE AN AGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER THOSE STANDARDS THAT ARE TAUGHT THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIRE TO DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES MANY SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS HAVE A SCOPE IN A SEQUENCE. THAT'S ATTACHED TO THOSE STANDARDS SO THINK WHAT THE WHICH WE'RE GONNA TEACH A PARTICULAR IS ENTERED AND- SIX SIX TO NINE WEEKS TEACHERS IN THE SAME GREAT LEVEL OR TEACHING THE SAME SUBJECT AREA CAN COLLABORATE. THIS TO LOOK AT STUDENT ASSESSMENT DATA AND GET IT. BERMAN WHAT IT STUDENTS LEARN AND WHAT DO WE STILL NEED TO REVISIT AT SCHOOL OR AS A GRADE LEVEL TEAM. AND THOSE SYSTEMS. I THINK THE QUESTION BE TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THOSE SYSTEM STILL IN PLACE I KNOW. I KNOW WE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AGAIN WITH OUR OUR TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ABOUT WHAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENT WORK EXPECTATIONS WITH THIS. AND PART OF THAT DISTANCE LEARNING PLAN THAT WE DEVELOP ONCE AGAIN I SAY WE DEVELOPED BUT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NETWORK OF EDUCATOR THAT ASSURING FORCES I SAY WE- BORROWED. LOOKED AT THEIR FRAMES FROM A NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DECIDED WHAT WILL WORK IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT EVEN THOUGH I THINK THAT THAT THAT TOOK A FEW WEEKS THAT SIT DOWN WITH. OUR TEACHERS UNION THAT SAY WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS SO AND- THE WITHIN THAT I MENTIONED THE STUDENT LEARNING PART BUT THE TEACHER LEARNING AS A RESULT OF STUDENT LEARNING. IN OTHER WORDS USING THE RESULTS OF ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE YOUR NEXT STEP DOWN AS THE AT THE TEACHER. THAT'S BEEN PART OF OUR CONVERSATION WITH THEM THAT WE HAVE TO SAY ALL CAME. WE USED TO HAVE A WYNNSTAY COLLABORATION TIME FOR TEACHERS. WEDNESDAY COLLABORATION TO ACT WHAT'S THAT LOOK LIKE NOW IS THAT STILL EXPRESS THEIR KERR. OUT I DIDN'T EXPECT TO OCCUR. WE TYPICALLY IT WOULD HAPPEN IN MANY CASES THEY WILL YOUR TO COME UP. WHAT WOULD BE THE END AND- THOSE FACT. WHEN ARE THE GREAT TEAMS CONTAIN TO MEET. AND TRANSFERRED INTO THIS NEW SYSTEM THAT WE'RE APPROACHING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR BUT SOME OF IT'S REALLY JUST DECIDING LOGISTICALLY WHAT WILL WORK WITHIN OUR PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION I MIX AND- MENTION THE WINDS THAT COLLABORATION. DISTRICTS THOSE OPPORTUNITY DO SOME DON'T SO THOSE SAME SYSTEMS THAT WERE IN PLACE BEFORE SOME OF THOSE WILL BE JUST- ADJUSTED TO IT INTO OUR NEW NORM. SO I'LL JUST AS YOU LAST QUESTION THAT I KNOW WE GOT TO MOVE ON TO SOME OF THE OTHER. MY OTHER COLLEAGUES READING OF CHANCE TO HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS QUESTIONS. I'M THEN YOU. SO AS AS YOU'RE DEVELOPING THIS- WITH YOUR TEACHERS LET'S HAVE THE ASSUMPTION ON HOW THE TEACHERS WEREN'T ABLE TO GET- GIVE THE KIND OF INSTRUCTION THEY WANTED TO THE LAST ONE THIRD OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WHAT PLANS DO YOU HAVE INTO THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR IN TERMS OF CATCHING A LOT. THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION FOR OUR PARTICULAR SYSTEM ONCE AGAIN WE JUST SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING- MO YOU WITH THERE ARE TEACHERS ABOUT SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT DAYS AGO. SO WE'RE WE'RE REALLY WELL DONE GETTING THE END OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR WE'RE HAVING CONGRESS ABOUT. THE COLLECTION OF MATERIALS AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WE HAVE A CONVERSATIONS ABOUT GRADUATION THAT PROMOTION- WHERE TESTING WHAT OUR SUMMER SCHOOL MAY LOOK LIKE- I THINK RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER WHEN I'M STARTING TO HEAR FROM THE FIELD IS THAT ARE ACCOMPLISHED. ABOUT YOU YOU HEARD EARLIER ASSESSING STUDENTS. AS WE WERE TO SCHOOL. AND TO SEE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE LEARNING GAPS. OUT SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY IS JUST THE BOBBING INTO THAT. CONVERSATION RECOGNIZING. THAT THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING NEXT YEAR BUT I CAN SAY. WHAT'S THE DATE WAS MARCH STEP EITHER SIXTEEN WHERE MANY OF THE SCHOOL STARTED. CLOSING THE IN SCHOOL INSTRUCTION WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN A VERY SHORT TIME. AND I KNOW THERE ARE COMMERCE ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO MITIGATE THE LEARNING LOSS. AND IT LEAVES THOSE CONVERSATIONS THOUGH IT ONLY WE ARE WE'RE ALWAYS INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND SOME WHERE EVERYBODY GETS SAYING WE COULD DO BETTER AND I THINK WE COULD DO BETTER AND I SAY WE TOTAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. EVERYTHING IMPACTS THEIR BEING RIGHT. AFTER OUR PARTICULAR. WE ALREADY TASK CUTTING CERTAIN MILLIONS ABOUT FIVE MILLION. GOING NEXT. SO WHAT THAT MEANT FOR US WELL. PRIOR TO NINE. WE HAD OUR LIMóN SOME OUR SUMMER LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WE DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP A CREDIT RECOVERY COMPONENT. MAINLY FOR SECONDARY STUDENTS THAT WERE TRYING TO OUT AS WE GET TO. THEIR GRADUATION.BUT THAT MEANS WE HAD ELIMINATED SUMMER LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADES K. THROUGH EIGHT. AT THE END OF THAT AND THE WAY OF RESPONDING TO AN I'M A CONCERN. FOR SO. NOW HAVE THE CODE AT NIGHT IN. IN A DAY GROUP STUDENTS ARE THAT WOULD HAVE LEARNING NEED. I WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR FOR. FUNDING IN OUR RESOURCE THAT AVAIL. AT THAT ARE. DECIDE ON WHAT ARE NEXT STEP. WE DON'T KNOW AND THEN I HAVE TO I CAN'T SAY THAT WE HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT IT'S PART OF THE EQUATION. AND THE DOLLARS AND CENTS ARE PART OF THAT. THAT CONVERSATION- WE'RE- WE'RE LIKE I SAID MY GOOD. IS THAT 4260% OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARE HAD EXTREME FISCAL. WORRIES IN CONSIDERATION BEFORE COVE IT NINETEEN. AND THIS IS JUST GONNA EXACERBATED. SO THAT I KNOW THAT DOESN'T FULLY ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT I KNOW I HAVE FAITH AND- EDUCATE. BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS- AND THEY'RE GONNA XCELERATED NOW THAT WE'VE- I'M GONNA SAY WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH BUT WE'RE- WE GOT A PRETTY CLEAR DIRECTIONS FOR THIS SCHOOL YEAR. AND NOW WE'RE STARTING THAT HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD NEXT SCHOOL YEAR LOOK LIKE. THE THANK YOU ARE PRE. SIR OF. OKAY Q. JUST A LITTLE OUT CHECK IN HERE ABOUT ONE TWENTY. WE HAVE TWO MORE STE THEM WHO LIKE TO SPEAK TO A MEMBER MOUNT. AND THEN IT'S MAYOR MARZI AND HOW MAY PEOPLE DO WE ON MY FOR PER COMMENT. WHEN WE LOOK AT HAVE PUBLIC. AND WE'RE HAVE A TIME SIR PUBLIC BE WE HAVEN'T HEARING. AT THREE O'CLOCK WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK BEFORE THEN. SO WITH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE MONTH. I THINK YOU AND I REALLY WANT TO THINK THAT ARE BUT FOR. COMMENT AND YOU KNOW I TO ECHO WITH YOU THING AND THEN I A QUESTION. SO ONE EIGHT THAT WAY HAS BEEN SAID AND- OF THINKING ABOUT GRADES FOR K. TWELVE STUDENTS- IS VERY IMPORTANT CERTAINLY RIGHT NOW- THERE IS A DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF HOW DISTRICTS ARE. BEING A IN WITH IT I ASSEMBLY IT UP NOT ALL. CAN THE GREAT CITY I AND THESE GRAY. ARE IN. TO US IN HIGH LEVEL I'M IMPACT UP WITH. BUT ALSO DO WRONG THAT SOME I'VE I'VE NOT HEARD- THERE THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONSIDERATION ON- WHAT THE CONSISTENCY- MIGHT NEED TO BE ADD THE LONGER WE GO INTO THIS- THE OTHER PIECE I WANTED TO ECHO WAS AT RELATED TO GEOGRAPHY. I STARTED IN THIS HEARING TALKING ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT'S GOING TO BE FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN UP TO BE PART OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY- AND HAVING SAID THAT RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL COMMUNITIES ARE THE SAME RIGHT NOW WHEN I THINK OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND HAVING NOT ONLY THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN OUR STATE BUT ALSO HAVING KOBE CASES THAT ARE GOING UP- AND STILL SEEN A NUMBER OF REALLY DIFFICULT HEALTH SITUATE IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY I CAN'T IMAGINE- THAT. A COUNTY- LIKE LOS ANGELES COUNTY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING AS A DIFFERENT COUNTY AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE- ACCEPTANCE FOR AND THE IDEA THAT. COUNTIES MIGHT BE IN AND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION AND I WANT US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCES IN AUGUST AND SEE WHAT WE ARE AND ABLE TO YOU. THAT I MEAN. WE'RE OUT EXT. OUTCOME IN THE LONG TERM OUR STUDENTS I EIGHT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO IT SOMEWHAT TO ADDITIONALLY I ACT THAT THE- REAL TO SO BILLS IT WOULD VERY. TO KNOW HOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICIPATING ARE NOT FULLY PART. I KNOW AND SOME OF DISTRICTS. READ THAT PARTICIPATE. BUT THE SAME. FAMILIES THAT ARE. A SENSE WORKER THIS FOR THAT WERE ALREADY LIVING ON THE ACT. MORE% ARE THE SAME ONES THAT ARE HAVING AHARD TIME GETTING THEIR CHILDREN AND STUDENTS TO SOME OF THIS FEEDING KIDS HAS NEVER BEEN SO DIFFICULT- IT IS A VERY BIG CHALLENGE IN A AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW. AND THIS RELATES NOT JUST TO THEIR LEARNING BUT ALSO RELATES TO THEIR HEALTH. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE UP I WANT TO ASK WE WE'VE IN THIS CONVERSATION TODAY WE HAVE. IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE TASK FORCE WHETHER IT'S THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION OR THE GOVERNOR OR JUST A GENERAL TASK FORCE I'M NOT CLEAR ABOUT THEIR TIME LINES I THINK I NOW KNOW. WHAT TO OUTCOMES THEY WERE UP THE WE THE LET SLEEP YOUR START TO WHAT SOME OF. SPORTS RECOMMEND ARE. E. HERE IN. I FIRST. MEN ON MAN WHILST BEING. MOVE BILLS FOR WHETHER IT'S ONE OR WHY IT'S AN MORE THAN BUT HAVE MOVED CONVERSE AND BILLS FAR AND PA OVER ALL AND IT EIGHT YOU KNOW I TO MAKE THAT THE TASK REC AND IDEAS ARE LINE I DON'T EXPECT FOR THEM TO BE- RESULTS THAT WE GET OVERNIGHT BUT CERTAINLY THERE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY AND ALL OF THIS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE FIRST TO IDENTIFY SOME TIME IN STATE WE ARE A LEGISLATIVE. I'M A KEY IN IT TO WHEN MIGHT BE RECEIVING SOME THESE RIGHT AND WHEN WE MIGHT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE WILL OR WON'T DO AND NOW MIGHT BE QUESTION FOLLOWING WHEN I DID THE TIME OF THIS. IS AT THIS PARTICULAR PANEL IT WAS ABOUT LEARNING WE- HAVE A WAY TO. LEARN DID YOU OR DID YOU KNOW LEARN SOMETHING FOR STUDENTS- AND THAT WASTE TYPICALLY I AM VERY MUCH MODELS FOR A SCHOOL PROGRAM WHERE YOU SEE KIDS IN PERSON. BUT THIS IS ABOUT LOS. HOW ARE WE MEASURING LEARNING LOS HOW AS WE HOW ARE WE AS LEGISLATORS ACTUALLY GOING TO KNOW WHAT STUDENTS ARE LOSING AND ALL OF THIS AND- THAT I HOPE WILL INFLUENCE HOW WE THINK. ABOUT AND THAT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT ARE BEING USED WHEN WILL WE HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE LOS TRULY IS FOR STUDENTS I'M AND IF YOU COULD DIG A LITTLE BIT DEEPER AND PROVIDE SPECIFIC. CAN WE WHAT IS THE LOOK. AT NINETEEN JUST LEARNING IS THAT A ONE ON ONE I'M THE AS SOO IS THAT A PHONE CALL IS THAT- YOU KNOW CLASSROOM ASSESSMENT WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE HOW DO YOU MEASURE LEARNING LOS. THAT'S FOR ANY OF THE EDUCATORS PLEASE. THIS HEATHER HAVE ALL DON'T BET ON THAT I THINK THAT THERE IS NO WAIT THINK ABOUT HOW WE MEASURE A LOT AND ONE IN THE WAY THEY YOU ACT WHICH IS WHY. ARE THEY NOT. BUT I THAT ANOTHER WAY WE ADDRESS IT YEAH. ANDREA HOW CAN YES THAT WHAT THEY AND WHAT THEY NEED. OUR AND LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY I IT'S MORE HELPFUL FOR THE SYSTEM BUT ALL FOR A- WHO YOU THAT AND FOR. WITH JUST HOW FAR BEHIND OUR- IF I A PARTICULAR STOOD IN MY- WHAT MAKES YOUR- THEY NEED TO TAUGHT. AND HOW CAN WE WORKING OUR- AROUND THINKING OUT I THANK YOU. AND PERFECT REASON WHY RECKON IN MY COMMENTS THAT WE CAN. HE EIGHT LEVEL AND THERE'S MANY YEARS RESEARCH EVIDENCE THAT DOC WHAT SOME OF THESE MIGHT BE. SO IF WE ASK TEAM IN EVERY CLASSROOM FIRST EVERY DISTRICT LEVEL UP THEIR OWN ASSESSMENT. I YOU'RE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY. TO FIND IN A IF HERE HEALTH. AND SOME THAT RIGHT. I THINK AND OF THOSE THAT ARE WERE IN A MORE CENTRAL WAY SO I DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF ADD OR- YOU KNOW EVEN FROM A IN FIRST CAN YOU. DESCRIBE WHAT THAT SENT PROCESS IS LIKE IS THAT BEGINNING IS THERE A WAY TO THIS OUR DOING IT. I LIKE TO JUST A- THIS IS WONDER GIRL HAMMOND ST BOARD OF ED. WE DO ALREADY. HAVE THE SMALL BELLS JUST SISTER IN THIS. OF WHICH- AN- ASSESSED. OF THAT IS TIED TO OUR STAND IT'S NOT AND ALL HAS. ENORMOUS THAT ARE YOU THEY CAN BE YOU TO READ. A VERSION OF THE COMPLETE ANNUAL ASSESSMENT. OR CAN BE TAILORED TO SPECIFIC. AREAS IN THE CURRICULUM. HAVING TO DO WITH- FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW A READING LITERACY. MATHEMATICS THOSE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE- AND CAN BE USED AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL. BUT ALSO BE. UNDERSTOOD AT THIS OF AND ACTIVATE AND NOW WAY THERE ALSO. SHE KINDS OF TOOLS THE DISTRICTS USE FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN THAT A BECAUSE THAT ASSISTANCE IN THIRD GRADE SOME DISTRICTS USE THINGS LIKE THE- DEVELOPMENTAL READING ASSESSMENT WHICH HAS A CONTINUING THE TEACHERS CAN USE TO WATCH GROWTH AND UPRIGHT ALONG THE LITERACY CONTINUUM. I AND OTHER TOOLS THAT SO AT THE DISTRICT THERE MANY SUCH TOOLS AVAILABLE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE ALSO HAVE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR LOOKING AT WHERE STUDENTS ARE AND AS THEIR SAID WHAT NEED TO LEARN NEXT. AND JUST FOR. FROM THE C. AGES ADDING. WHAT LOW DOES THE ALL OF. ARE TO ARE T. ACROSS THE STATE. AND FOR FREE AT WE- HAVE QUITE OF. OTHER TEACHERS THAT ARE YOU THEM THE STATE WE HAVE OVER MILLIONS OF THOSE ASSESSED BEING. I'M ON A DAY BASIS. AND SO THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE AND FREE AND THEY SHOW THE TEACHERS WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE ACTS. AND ANY HOLES THAT THEY MAY HAVE BASED ON OUR CALIFORNIA STATE STANDARDS. SO THEN LET ME ASK YOU THIS BOTH FOR DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND AND FOR THE CD. IS OUR BELIEF THAT THE SAME TOOLS WE WERE USING TO MEASURE STUDENT LEARNING BEFORE COVERT NINETEEN. SHOULD BE IN PLACE. POST COVERT NINETEEN OR ARE THOSE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE. OUR STANDARDS HAVE NOT CHANGED. RIGHT SO THAT'S MENTAL'S SO I THAT RIGHT STANDARD HAVEN'T BUT THE A TOOLS BECAUSE NOT MEASURE LEARN WERE ALSO MEASURING LEARNING LOS NOW AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO KNOW. THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS CAN'T STILL YOU. WE WOULD ACTUALLY WORK ON AND I BELIEVE. LINK THAT STARTING ALREADY SPENT TO THE RUN TO TIE. AND STUFF HE- TO HELP FURTHER INTO. I FOR OUR- FIRST AND SO GRADE. WHERE THERE LEARNING AS TO BEEN OUR READ. AND BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A REALLY A- DYING. AND INFORMATION TO HAVE FOR TEACHERS OF WHAT GAPS ARE THERE AND THERE READINGS. DO YOU KNOW THE TIME AWAY AND TRY WITH THE DISTANCE LEARNING RIGHT AND JUST I TO THE QUESTION LEARNING WHEN PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT ABOUT THAT IN THE- RICHER. THERE CHOI ABOUT WHERE STUDENTS ARE IN AGGREGATEDANALYSIS. HE'S A BIT WORK IT IN. YEAR AS WE OF X. THEM TO BE ANOTHER WAS THEY FOR EXAMPLE LOOKS. IN SORT OF A YEAR WORTH OF GROW OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR BUT WITH THESE. OF WITH THE THAT WERE TALK ABOUT YOU CAN OF SEE WORST WERE AND DISTRICT DO THIS REGULAR. WHERE WERE STUDENTS STAND. OF TWO TWO AND WHERE ARE IN. YOU KNOW JIM WHERE ARE THEY- SO. I YOU CAN PROGRESS INDIVIDUALS WHEN YOU'RE USING THESE KINDS OF DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS I'M SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO KNOW. STUDENTS ACT. GET DUMBER. LEARNING WAS REAL BIG CONTINUE LEARN BUT THEY CAN LOOK. UP FACILITY AT A FULL ONCE IN SOME SO AND YOU WEIGH YOUR TO. LIKE NAS ASSESSMENTS OR TIME BUT STILL ARE WAYS TO DO THE TWO NOT. IS A MANAGED WITH LARGE SCALE SOME TELL THAT ARE NOT. CHEERED AND TRACK TO SEE. SKILLS THE YOU AND- I GUESS IT I'M THINKING IF I'M A PARENT AND I'M TO MAKE IT TO. AND THIS IS GOES ON FOR WEAR DO YOU KNOW EACH IS THIS IS AT HOME WE STE MOVING THE MODEL THAT A LOT OF YOU HAVE TO WHICH IS A OF BLENDER LEARNING A SATURDAY A. M. P. BLOCKS. HOLIDAY SHIPS ALL THAT GOOD STUFF AT WHAT POINT DO I HAVE SOME INFORMATION TO HELP ME DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WHAT THAT CHILD HAS OR HAS NOT LEARNED SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE CHILD HOULD- SHOULD THAT A PARENT AND A TEACHER SHOULD CONSIDER ON WHETHER THE CHILD MOVES FORWARD. I THINK YOU MISSED IT YOU KNOW TANG MENTIONED IT JUST DO WE READ SURE FREE I MEAN. THAT'S A COMMENT THAT IS IT YOU KNOW. I'M SURE. YOU KNOW. HOW SERIOUS HE WAS BUT AT SOME POINT WE DO ACT HAVE TO CAN THAT AT WHAT POINT DO WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT STUDENTS ARE OR ARE NOT LEARNING TO HELP US DETERMINE WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT OR YOU KNOW A GROUP OF STUDENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REPEAT A YEAR BECAUSE THE LEARNING WASN'T SUCH BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MISSING ONE OR TWO STANDARDS. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT I COULD BE WRONG I MEAN I CAN I WAS IN A DISTRICT THAT HAD WILD FIRES AND DEBRIS FLOWS AND CERTAINLY SHUT DOWN MUCH LONG BUT THIS IS. WHAT WE WENT THROUGH THEN IT'S NOTHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENING NOW- AND AT EIGHT AND THEN YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT IT'S CERTAINLY THAT'S ON OUR MY- I'M FIGHT EVERY. VERY GOOD EFFORTS. AT BEEN MADE YOU KNOW BY. I TEACHERS IN PARENTS I TO THIS. MY FOR THIS TO AND THEIR YOU KNOW INTO THE ASSN TO LOG ON AT SOME POINT. NOW EVERY STUDENT ISN'T A AND WHEN DO WE FACE THAT OUT AND DO WE DECIDE. WHAT KINDS OF DECISIONS ARE MADE FOR FUTURE YEARS. WELL I JUST LIKE TO OFFER A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO. LEAVE BECAUSE I'M MISSING ANOTHER MEETING THAT I CAN'T RESCHEDULE. FIRST THERE WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT LARGE SCALE GRADE RETENTION HAS BEEN DONE IT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED AND STUDIED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS THERE ARE. HUNDREDS OF STUDIES ON THAT AND ONLY NOT TO WORK IN TERMS OF ACHIEVEMENT GAINS. BUT ALSO TO CREATE A HIGHER RATES OF ACHIEVEMENT LOS AND- DROP OUT SO WE WILL NOT BE RECOMMENDING THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE RED SHIRT KIDS FOR AN ENTIRE. YEAH SYSTEM OVER ENTIRE YEAR- THERE ARE A LOT OF STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE USED TO ACCELERATE LEARNING AND THEY DO RELY IN PART ON KNOWING WHERE KIDS ARE. IN THEIR LEARNING RIGHT NOW SO THAT YOU CAN GET A LOT OF LEARNING IS CUMULATIVE IF YOU JUMP OVER SKIP OVER SKILLS. YOU KNOW THAT'S A PROBLEMS YOU DO NEED TO HAVE THAT CONTINUOUS LEARNING SO HAVING THAT DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO KNOW WHERE KIDS ARE HE'S A IN YOU CAN LEARN THAT AND KNOW THAT AS A PARA. AND IN THE SCHOOLS. HE'S THE WORK HERE MAIN BE OR ON EVERYTHING BE AT MOMENT IN TIME. IS POSSIBLE TO HOW MANY TO OF A- OF TOOLS TO DO THAT A REPORT TO PARENTS ABOUT THAT PRIDE. IN ANY OF THAT WHY IS TO BE ACTED. IN THE FALL OF OR WHENEVER WHETHER IT'S SUMMER OR FALL WITH NEVER LEARN. IN RISEN WAS AND TRADITIONAL SCHOOL GEN OUR. AT YOU NEED TO PUT. THOSE SO. OR YOU KNOW SERVE THE SHOP THE KIDS MIGHT NEED TO GO THROUGH A AND WE CAN BE HELPFUL DISTRICTS AND FROM ABOUT TOOLS STRATEGIES THAT HAVE FOUND TO BE SIX IN. RAP EXCEL OF AND WE CAN BE OF COURSE OF PROVIDING EXPAND LEARNING. THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING YOUR ROOM. THAT MAKE PLACE IN BOTH IN THE SOME AND MAY BE AND YOU KNOW VARIOUS AFTER SCHOOL SO CENTER SCHOOL ORDER RISKY TIMES. THE KEY IS. A TO KNOW WHY THE CHOI IS A THEIR WORK AND BE ABLE TALK TO RESTORE AND- IS. TO THE- NEED AT THEM SO THAT LEARNING CAN BE A- THANK YOU I. QUESTION EIGHTEEN AND DISCUSS OVERALL IN I DO I'M GET AND JUST COMMENTS ABOUT THE FUNDING I THINK AND WE'VE HEARD AND NUMBER OF NEED OF ALL AND ALL COME BUT I AM GAY ECHO. OF I THINK WE SOME MIGHT HAVE SAY.
