SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION FOR POLICY REASONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE. ADDITIONAL. MEMBERS OPPOSITION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FIVE. DIRTY QUESTIONS I THINK MISTER BIGELOW HOUSE ONE. YES ON BUSTAMANTE. LOOKING THROUGH YOUR BILL THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF. TREPIDATION WITH SOME FOLKS AND WE JUST HEARD ONE OF THEM AND THEIR REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE MANDATE ISSUE COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE BIT FOREST. AND KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT. IT IS IT IS A QUESTION ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A MANDATE SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT I CAN HAVE ACTUALLY MACHEL. ADD TO THIS BUT I DO WANT TO SEE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY CURRENTLY IN FEDERAL STATUTE AND SO THE GOAL IS TO HAVE IT IN STATE STATUTE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO IT WOULDN'T CHANGE WHO. TO COMPLY WITH THIS I JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL LAW WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT AND WE WOULD BE DOING AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE. REQUESTING THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT. CHANGE THE FACT THAT. EMPLOYERS WOULD STILL NEED TO MAKE A REASONABLE EFFORT SO THAT REASONABLE EFFORTS STANDARD STILL. APPLIES CURRENTLY AND WITH. THE PROPOSED CHANGES. SO FOR CLARK. ARE YOU WILLING ARE YOU STILL. THE WORK WE. WE'RE STILL WORKING ON WAY OUT OPPOSITION DEFINES. COMMON GROUND WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATIONS. BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU ON. PERSONALLY DON'T AGREE WITH HAVING WOMEN. NURSING AND BATHROOM STALLS. WHAT WE DO OUR BUSINESS? OKAY I AM GLAD THANK YOU THINK YOU'RE HOT THE EYE IN THE AND IT'S APPRECIATED RAVING THAT THIS IS WHAT IT IS IT'S A IT'S A HEALTH. AND ISSUE I THINK WE WANT YOU KNOW KIDS BABIES TO BE HEALTHY IN OUR COMMUNITY THIS IS BIGGER AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA. UMMAH CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR MOTHERS WHO ARE BREASTFEEDING AND FOR THE KIDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEALTHY ON AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ENCOURAGING BREASTFEEDING WHICH IS A GOOD THING. I AGREE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M. WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND BUT WE NEED A COUPLE MORE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE TO SHOW UP AND SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND. BUT THAT I'M CALL AND TELL EVERYBODY. HERE UP I WOULD ASK TO TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ON YOUR BILL WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AND ANYONE ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR. AS A CO AUTHOR THINK YOU THINK MS LIMON. MISS COMING AT ALL. YOU'LL BE PRESENTING ON A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH WILL MAKE THE CALIFORNIA CHILD DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES CREDIT REFUNDABLE. SO THAT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT THIS UP CHILDCARE. TO ASSIST THEM WITH THEIR CHILD CARE EXPENSES THE CRITIC CURRENTLY ALLOWS TAXPAYERS. WITH INCOMES BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REDUCE THEIR TAX LIABILITY BY CERTAIN PERCENTAGES FURTHER ELIGIBLE CHILDCARE EXPENSES IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE STATE MADE THE CREDIT NON REFUNDABLE DUETO BUDGET SHORTFALLS. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT FAMILIES WITH INCOMES LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RECEIVE NO BENEFIT FROM THE CURRENT CREDIT. SINCE IT BECAME NON REFUNDABLE NINETY PERCENT OF THE CREDIT WAS CLAIMED BY FILERS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT. THAT IF YOU'RE EARNING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT IN CONTRAST WHEN THE CREDIT WAS REFUNDABLE. SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE MONEY WAS CLAIMED BY FILERS WITH INCOMES LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IF THE POOREST OF THE POOR THAT ACTUALLY COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. OUGHT TO MEET THEIR BASIC EXPENSES. WE KNOW THAT CHILDCARE IS THE SECOND HIGHEST COST AND. SO RESPECTFULLY IT ANDERSON THIS IS GOING ON SUSPENSE BUT I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO FAMILIES IN MY COMMUNITY. WITH ME HERE TODAY IS MICHELLE STILL APARTMENTS KEY FROM THE CHECK CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING MICHELLE SOBRE MINSKY CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL TO MAKE THE CHILD INDEPENDENT EXPENSES CREDIT REFUNDABLE ON SO THAT LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS HELP ON TO DEFRAY THE. RISING COST OF CHILDCARE. RIGHT NOW THE CREDIT EXCLUDES THOSE WHO ARE MOST TRUGGLING ON TO PAY FOR CHILDCARE EXACTLY THE FAMILIES THAT WE SHOULD BE HELPING MOST. UNDER AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE A LOW INCOME FAMILY COULD RECEIVE A REFUNDABLE CREDIT OF UP TO ONE THOUSAND FIFTY DOLLARS WHICH IS ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF WHAT CHILD CARE COSTS. BUT WOULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES AND BUDGETS OF FAMILIES WHO ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. RESEARCH REVEALS THAT REFUNDABLE TAX CREDITS NOT ONLY INCREASE FAMILIES INCOMES BUT ALSO IMPROVE CHILD HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND SAVE MONEY. TO FOR THE STATE IN THE LONG RUN. FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES EVEN A SMALL INCREASE IN FAMILY INCOME IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EARNINGS IN ADULTHOOD. AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE MAKES A SMALL STEP TO MAKE THE TAX CODE MORE EQUITABLE CURRENTLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES PAY A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES. GIVEN THAT WOMEN WOMEN OFTEN BEAR THE BRUNT OF CHILDCARE COSTS THIS BILL ALSO ADVANCES GENDER EQUITY AND CLOSING THE WOMEN'S WEALTH GAP. BUT AB TWENTY FORTY THREE IS A LONG OVERDUE POLICY THAT WILL HELP WORKING FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AYE AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AS A BUILDING COALITION IN SUPPORT. JESSICA BARTOLO WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. DONNA STARED AT THE CHILD CARE ALLIANCE OF LOS ANGELES OUR BOARD IS CONSIDERING.

EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS REVENUE LOSS ASSUMES AN ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE BILL'S COST EACH YEAR. I WE ALSO KNOW THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED BETTER EXPECT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS IF NOT. CHUCK CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WHEN IT COMES UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. I AM WORRY AND I'M SORRY BECAUSE I I. KNOW SOMEBODY IS NEXT ON THE LIST BUT WE'RE GONNA GET LET MISS REYES DO HER. BILL AS A COURTESY.

MR LAWYERS PRESENT NAME ON AB TWENTY ONE OH THREE AND ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. IF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE A THREE IS WATCHING CLOSELY SOBBING JUST EXTREMELY BRIEF BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS BILL WILL DO THREE THINGS ONE IT WILL. ESTABLISH A MINIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS FOR TRAINING FOR CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS. SECONDLY IT REQUIRES US APPLICANTS FOR SUCH PERMITS TO DEMONSTRATE SAFE HANDLING PROFICIENCY ON A FIRING RANGE AND LASTLY AMENDMENTS TO AB TWENTY ONE OH THREE REQUIRE LOCAL LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC BY FIRE PROFICIENCY STANDARDS.

SINCE NINETEEN OH EIGHT WHEN THE CCW PROCESS WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE SINGLE INCIDENT WHERE A CCW HOLDER HAS. BEEN CHARGED OR CRITICIZED FOR BEING. UNWISE IN THEIR USE OR FOR LACK OF TRAINING. THE IT THROUGH THEIR CLASSES IN WITH THE USE OF A FIREARM. UNDER ILLEGAL CCW. THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THIS IS THAT IS NOT BEING CONSIDERED IS THAT NOW EVERY SHERIFF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO HAVE TO. REDO THEIR. CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR INSTRUCTORS. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEND ALL THAT INFORMATION OUT ALL INSTRUCTORS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO. RE DO THEIR THEIR THEIR OF CURRICULUM AND SUBMIT THEM FOR APPROVAL. NOW. THAT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE AND EXPENSE TO A LOT OF FOLKS BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE. STATE AUDITOR. DATA ON AUDIT OF MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND FOUND THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS OF RIGHT NOW THIS WILL PUT A BURDEN ON A LOT OF COUNTIES. HERE IS THE FACT. THIS IS ALREADY BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND DOES NOT NEED ANY ADDITIONAL. LAWS OR REGULATIONS TO FIX SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM. THE ONLY TIME THAT CCW A INSTRUCTORS DO NOT. I'LL OFFER LIVE FIRE TRAINING IS WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE OFFERING CLASSES TO OUR VERY WELL OF VERSED IN THE USE OF FIREARMS. THERE ARE NAVY SEALS RETIRED THERE ARE. DELTA OPERATORS RETIRED THERE ARE MORE SOCCER OPERATORS RETIRED THERE OF VETERANS RETIRED THERE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO NO LONGER SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO WOULD BE REQUIRED. TO PROVE THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO SHOOT A GUN. AFTER THEY HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH MORE TRAINING THAN. EVERYBODY PUT TOGETHER. POSSIBLY BE REQUIRED TO DO. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THIS A SEEKING UP ANSWER TO A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST THAT'S WHY WE ARE STRONG OPPOSITION WE HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER THOSE. FISCAL. ASPECTS. FOR THE RECORD IN REVIEW NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION AND IN THE INTEREST OF BREVITY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION ALL ECHO WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE SAID THIS IS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. WE ARE PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THERE IS A LACK OF TRAINING AMONG CCW HOLDERS CURRENTLY IN THE STATE.

ANOTHER MORNING ORGANISED IN ON THE KILL EM ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OUR CONCERN IS THAT. OUTLYING SIGNATURE PAYMENT ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS WILL MAKE IT PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO ADDRESS THEIR GRIEVANCES DIRECTLY WITH GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE IT AND TOO EXPENSIVE TO DO A RECALL OR AN INITIATIVE AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO A REFERENDUM.
