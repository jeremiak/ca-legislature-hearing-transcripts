DIDN'T TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.807
WHAT'S IN THEM BUT ONE OF THE

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:26.075
THINGS THAT'S RECOGNIZED IN

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:27.877
THOSE IS IT THAT OUR OUR MULTI

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.979
NODE OF WAYS TO GET INFORMATION

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:32.548
OUT SOCIAL MEDIA ABSOLUTELY IS

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:34.049
AB ONE OF THE PROMINENT WAYS WE

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:36.419
USE IT- TO RELATE I'M EVEN

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:37.920
EMERGENCY INFORMATION AS DO

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:38.988
MOST COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S HOW

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:40.256
MOST PEOPLE YOU KNOW MANY

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.791
PEOPLE. ARE LOOKING OUT IN

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:43.826
DENVER AND RELY ON AS A SOURCE

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.661
SO THE GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.830
AND NOT JUST THE IPODS IN THE

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.765
WE- BUT LOCAL OTHER MORNING

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:51.801
PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW JUST

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.402
RECOGNIZING THAT THESE EXIST

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.771
AND- YOU KNOW WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.173
STANDARDIZE THOSE SAID THAT

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.374
AGAIN WERE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT

01:07:58.441 --> 01:07:59.942
ACROSS THE PUBLIC. TO THE

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:01.610
EXTENT WE NEED TO DO MORE

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.012
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ARE YOU

01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:05.181
KNOW ONGOING WORK IS- TO VALUE

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.682
WAIT HOW THAT WENT IF WE HAVE

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:09.485
TO BEEF UP THE- SOCIAL MEDIA-

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:10.419
KIND OF REFERENCE OR CREATE

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:11.821
SOMETHING EVEN AS AN ADDENDUM

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.222
WILL ABSOLUTELY DO THAT BUT

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.356
WE'LL WE'LL TAKE A LOOK. AT

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.926
THAT AND I'LL VERIFY THAT TIME

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:19.161
THAT WE'VE GOT TO THAT TYPE OF-

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:21.397
GUIDANCE CAPTURED AND CERTAINLY

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:22.965
AS WE WORKABLE GOVERNMENT GOING

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.733
FORWARD WE WILL BE EVALUATING

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.202
THAT BUT I APPRECIATE YOU

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:28.070
MAKING THAT COMMENT AND- A

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:29.872
GREAT. THAT THAT'S ANOTHER AREA

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.340
WHERE STANDARDIZATION AND

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.541
CONSISTENCY IS IMPORTANT

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:33.576
BECAUSE FOR THE FORESEEABLE

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:35.144
FUTURE THAT IS GOING TO BE A

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:39.315
REALLY PROMINENT WAY- THAT THAT

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:39.882
EMERGING INFORMATION WILL BE

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.684
DISTRIBUTED. WELL THANK YOU- IT

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.085
WOULD MAKE NO TO CHALLENGE

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:44.220
SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S HARD TO LIMIT

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:45.921
WHERE THE MESSAGE GOES SO THE

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:47.156
CLARITY THAT MESSAGE BECOMES

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.024
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.059
EXAMPLE EXACTLY WHICH AREAS ARE

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:52.328
AFFECTED ALL RIGHT- SO IT COULD

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:53.162
BE COMING FROM THE SHERIFF'S

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.964
OFFICE. AND THEY'RE JUST

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.664
THINKING IT'S GOING TO PEOPLE

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.233
IN THE COUNTY BUT PEOPLE

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.467
AFFORDING THINGS AND PEOPLE ARE

01:08:58.534 --> 01:08:59.935
ON THE BORDER TO GO WHAT WAS

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:01.036
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN FOR ME AS

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:02.171
I MENTIONED WHEN THE OROVILLE

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.974
DAM THEY HAD- ISSUE WITH THE-

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.642
THE NOW THE TAMPA TENCHI

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:09.011
OVERTOPPING OR DIRECT- THOSE OF

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.279
US ARE DOWNSTREAM WENT WHAT WAS

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.313
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN USERS

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.015
TRYING TO EVACUATE RIGHT AND

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:20.556
IRONICALLY THE FIRST I HEARD.

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:21.190
ABOUT IT WAS ON A LIST TO SEE A

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:21.991
ALERT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WAS NOT

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:22.591
THROUGH SOME OF SOURCE. SO I

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.226
THINK THAT- YOU KNOW SOME

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:25.327
CAREFUL EXAM. ABOUT OUR BEST

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:26.061
PRACTICES IT COMES TO SOCIAL

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:26.962
MEDIA POSTS THAT WHEN PEOPLE

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.631
SEE INFORMATION AND THEY'RE NOT

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:29.999
IN THE AREA WHAT HOW DO THEY

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:33.469
KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE AFFECTED-

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:35.838
YOU KNOW SO BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

01:09:35.905 --> 01:09:37.506
LOT OF PEOPLE SEEING IT. WHO-

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:38.841
WHO WILL BE INTERPRETING IN

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:39.875
DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON YOU

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.544
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND SO

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:42.678
FORTH SO I THINK THAT'S GONNA

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:43.812
BE VERY IMPORTANT. THEN I GUESS

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.381
THE OTHER QUESTION I ANSWER HAD

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:47.216
IS THAT I KNOW THAT THE

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:50.619
ABOUT.

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:52.321
AND NEED FOR BACK UP POWER AND

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:53.155
SO FORTH AND NINE AND I

01:09:53.222 --> 01:09:54.723
UNDERSTAND CERTAINLY. IN THIS

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:55.691
HEARING AND THAT THE MORE

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:56.992
IMMEDIATE CONCERNS WILDFIRES

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:59.061
BUT I REPRESENT SACRAMENTO OUR

01:09:59.128 --> 01:09:59.995
BIGGEST ISSUES TRYING TO BE

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:02.398
FLOOD. NOT SAY WE DON'T

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:03.966
POTENTIALLY A WILDFIRE. WE'RE

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.768
MORE THINK ABOUT THESE BACK UP

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:07.603
SYSTEMS. ARE WE ALSO PAYING

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:08.871
STANDARDS BE SURE THEY'RE

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:10.306
WALKING SINCE A FLOOD PROOF IS

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.707
PROBABLY OVER BUT THE FLOOD

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:13.142
RESISTANT RIGHT SO YOU NOTHING

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:15.244
GENERATORS ON THE GROUND. WHERE

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:16.345
WHEN THE WATER STARTS RISING

01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:17.880
BASICALLY THE GENERATORS GO OUT

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:18.914
AND CELL TOWERS ARE STILL OUT

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:21.116
SO. CAN YOU AYE MAYBE TOUCH ON

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:23.819
THAT. WELL OUR APPROACH IS ALL

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.388
HAZARDS WILDFIRES IS- I THINK

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:28.524
THAT IS. OCCURRING MORE

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:29.825
COMMONLY THESE DAYS IN

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.427
CALIFORNIA BUT BUT WE NEVER THE

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:34.330
DESTRUCTION. AND HER. FROM A

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.965
VARIETY OF MEANS YOU KNOW

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:37.032
WHETHER IT'S EIGHT YOU KNOW

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.667
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT THAT TAKES OUT

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.570
POWER OR A FLOOD DISASTER AN

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:42.338
EARTHQUAKE OR HAVE SO WE'RE

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:43.472
ALWAYS LOOKING AT A

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.874
COMPREHENSIVE WAY. TO ENSURE

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.977
THERE'S REDUNDANCY I DON'T HAVE

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:49.244
THAT TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE OF

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:50.946
EXACTLY THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.414
CELL TOWERS AND WHAT WORKS BEST

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:53.849
FOR DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.985
AND IN CALIFORNIA BUT- I DO

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.786
KNOW THAT. REDUNDANCY IN REGARD

01:10:57.853 --> 01:11:00.255
TO COMMUNICATION SO IT ARE VERY

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:01.824
UPSET PLANNING EFFORTS AND

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.158
EXERCISES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:05.561
OF DISASTER WE TALK THROUGH-

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:06.729
WHAT IT IS WE'RE GOING TO NEED

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:08.030
TO BE ABLE TO DO. AND HOW THE

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.565
STATE CAN WORK WITH OUR LOCAL

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:11.800
COMMUNITIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:12.835
WOULD BE THE REDUNDANCIES

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.603
WHETHER IT'S A REDUNDANCY FOR.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.438
TRANSPORTATION A REDUNDANCY FOR

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:18.574
COMMUNICATIONS SO- SO THAT IS

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:20.142
SOMETHING THAT WE THAT'S REALLY

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:21.510
IMPORTANT FOR US TO ALWAYS

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:23.045
ENSURE. ARE WARNING CENTER

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.280
ITSELF HAS MULTIPLE REDUNDANT

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:27.116
PATHWAYS- WE HAVE AND HE

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.250
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN INCLUDING A

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:30.285
MARKER WITH A SYSTEM. AND THAT

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:31.820
CONNECTS THE STATE FROM END TO

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:35.090
END FOR INFORMATION AND RELAY-

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:36.759
BY SATELLITE. INFORMATION

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.127
SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE IN EVERY

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.995
SINGLE COUNTY IN ADDITION TO

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:42.231
MOBILE COMMUNICATION- SO ALL OF

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:43.465
THAT'S THERE OF COURSE AND

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:44.466
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALERT

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:46.001
MORNING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:47.569
MESSAGING THAT CANNOT WAIT

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:49.505
UNTIL WE DISCOVER THAT IT HAD

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:51.206
OUTAGES OCCURRED AND THEN SO OF

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:52.307
COURSE SOME OF THESE ARE MORE

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:54.843
LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT- THAT

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.879
AT ABSOLUTELY. AB RIGHT

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:59.248
REDUNDANCY IS AN ABSOLUTE

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:00.683
PRINCIPLE IN OUR BUSINESS AND

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:02.051
ANYONE WHO'S IN PUBLIC SAFETY

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.152
EMERGENCY SERVICES AND

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.853
CERTAINLY- IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.021
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT TO MAKE

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:08.824
SURE THAT ON THIS TOPIC. THE

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:11.760
THE RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEMS

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.328
THAT SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.563
MESSAGING THAT HAS TO GO OUT TO

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.331
THE PUBLIC. IS RIGHT AS AS

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:19.501
ROBUST AS IT NEEDS TO BE SO- SO

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:26.075
I KIND OF A- LONG ANSWER TO SAY

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.477
THAT WE LOOK AT ALL HAVE- AND

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:29.511
IN ADDITION TO. THAT YOU NEED

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:31.513
MORE COMMON HAZARDS THAT FIXED.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:35.818
RECENTLY RESHAPE THAT- IT'S

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:37.386
HEARD STORY- NOT HERE AND TELL

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:38.353
BUT IN OTHER STATES WHERE

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.555
EXAMPLE IF HALF IN THE BUT ONLY

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:41.323
FLOOR THEN THEY WONDERED WHY

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:42.658
DIDN'T HAVE POWER. RIGHT-

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.393
BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER WATER

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.494
THEN WORK VERY WELL UNDER WATER

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:48.030
SO- AND CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT-

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.331
WE'VE INVESTED AS A STATE

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:50.299
HAVING BEEN ON BUDGET SUB

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:51.366
COMMITTEE AND VARIOUS

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:52.868
COMPONENTS COMMUNICATION BUT

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:53.602
THEN AGAIN THINK ABOUT THE

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:55.104
RESIDENCY TO THE PUBLIC I THINK

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.905
SPREAD THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE.

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.807
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU DON'T CONTROL

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.242
WHAT NOW WHEN WE HAVEN'T FOUND

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:01.577
ONLY A CELLPHONE OR HOW WE'RE

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.312
GETTING OUR INFORMATION AND YOU

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.546
KNOW WHETHER IT'S RADIO PHONE

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:06.448
OR OTHER TYPES OF SOURCES AND

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:09.651
INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA. THANK

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:11.453

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.189
THANK YOU I SENATE JACK'S. HAS

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:24.399
A QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH I

APPRECIATE IT AND THANK YOU FOR

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.136
THOSE VERY KIND WORDS YOU KNOW

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:29.571
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:32.808
COMMITTEE- THE PRINCIPAL OR AT

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.777
LEAST THE INITIAL IMPACT CRASH

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:36.111
PRIMARY ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS

THEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.026
POTENTIAL FOR DAM- PREACHING

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.427
AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND THE

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.929
POTENTIAL FOR EARTHQUAKES ALL

LOT OF THE DEATHS AND THE

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.610
DESTRUCTION THAT TOOK PLACE WAS

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:11.747
AS A RESULT OF INADEQUATE-

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:14.483
WARNINGS OR A DECISION MAKING

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.752
WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WERE THE

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:18.053
BEST APPROACH IS THAT PEOPLE

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.089
SHOULD TAKE- TO PROTECT

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:22.791
THEMSELVES- DURING THESE

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:25.861
INCIDENTS- SENATOR MCGUIRE HAS

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:27.262
DONE SOME VERY IMPORTANT

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.798
LEGISLATION ON WARNING SYSTEMS.

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:34.403
I ALSO- I DRAFTED AND WAS A

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:37.072
FORTUNE ENOUGH TO GET PAST OF

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.708
LEGISLATION TO EXPAND- COUNTY

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.910
LISTS WHEN- WHEN IT COMES TO

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:43.579
NOTIFICATIONS WE FIND THAT WHEN

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:46.081
IT'S AN OPT IN SYSTEM WE REALLY

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.884
HAVEN'T GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT OF-

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.652

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:53.021
IDEA CALLS FOR OPT OUT SYSTEM

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:57.593
SO THAT- PEOPLE WILK- WHERE

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.661
THEY COUNTIES WILL PROACTIVELY

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.630
PUT PEOPLE ON THESE WARNING

HAD A DIFFERENT- DESIGNATION SO

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:09.050
THE PUBLIC VERY CONFUSED AS TO

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:10.552
WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:11.986
BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS TOO

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:13.221
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT CAME TO

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.889
THE DEBRIS FLOW IS THAT THE

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:17.525
MAPS THAT THEY WERE USING. WERE

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:19.027
OLDER MAPS AND THEY WERE

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:21.396
INACCURATE AND WE LOST TWENTY

THE VARIOUS KINDS OF EMERGENCY-

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.689
MAPS AND DATA. THAT IS

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:48.990
AVAILABLE TO FOR LOCAL

FOLKS FIVE. WATERSHED US. AND

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:13.815
MAPPING IS A REAL TIME FOR.

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.650
THAT IS INJURED. INTO A PART OF

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:16.751
OUR RESPONSE STRUCTURE SO

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:18.253
IMMEDIATELY KICKS INTO GEAR WE

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:19.921
PARTNER WITH CAL FIRE. WITH A

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:22.757
GEOLOGIST AND- SASS YOU KNOW

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:23.892
WE'RE IN OUR WILD FIRES IN

TO BE DONE AND WE'RE DOING THAT

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:31.266
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WE

EXIST I BASED ON THE WILD CARDS

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:39.941
THAT JUST OCCURRED. SO THAT

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.543
THEY CAN THEN EMPLOY THAT INTO

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:43.445
THEIR PRE POSITIONING THEIR A

KIND OF EVACUATION PREPARATIONS

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:49.584
FOR THE PUBLIC SO THAT'S ONE

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:52.053
FACET- FOR THINGS LIKE. TWO

WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE OUR

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.725
GEOGRAPHY. YOU KNOW SORT OF A

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:59.060
WHAT A WORST CASE WOULD PRESENT

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:01.930
WEEDMAPS THE ENTIRE STATE OF

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:03.531
CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN DOWN OF

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.099
THE OF THE COAST. AND THAT'S AN

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:06.901
EFFORT THAT WE PARTNER WITH THE

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.369
WITH THE STATE GEOLOGIC SURVEY

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:11.039
ON. AND THAT INFORMATION IMPACT

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:12.474
IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN

AND END UP ON THE NORTH COAST

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.450
HAD HAD ISSUES HAD HAD TSUNAMI

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:24.018
INUNDATION. THEY ACTUALLY USE

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.320
THE TSUNAMI INUNDATION MAPS

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:27.021

THERE EVACUATION GUIDANCE OF

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:31.726
COURSE IN THAT CASE. THERE WAS

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.728
MANY HOURS OF WARNING A LITTLE

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.630
MORE TRYING. TO BE REALLY

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:40.655
DOLLARS. AND POST DISASTER WHEN

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:42.089
THOSE EVENTS OCCUR WHICH HAS

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:43.557
BEEN COMMONPLACE I THINK WE

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:44.892
HAVE SOME TWENTY SEVEN COUNTIES

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.460
UNDER A FEDERAL DECLARATION OF

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:48.095
DISASTER RIGHT NOW JUST BE FROM

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:49.664
THAT FOUR MILLION ACRES. OF

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:51.299
WILDFIRES THAT BURNED THAT'S

01:32:51.365 --> 01:32:52.767
NOT INCLUDING ALL THE STUFF

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:55.169
THAT PRE EXISTED ALL THE FIRES

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.705
AND THE EARTHQUAKE AND- IT IN A

01:32:57.772 --> 01:32:59.407
COUPLE SUMMERS AGO. SO EVERYONE

01:32:59.473 --> 01:33:01.509
OF THOSE BRINGS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:07.848
FOR RISK REDUCTION. FUNDS.

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:08.783
THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:09.583
PROJECTS THAT CAN BE DONE THOSE

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:11.385
WERE DOT FINDS FOR AWHILE.

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:13.354
INCLUDING THE ENHANCEMENT OF

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.556
EVACUEE. BEEN MANAGEMENT- AB

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:18.025
THAT. THAT ARE FIRE- IF SOMEONE

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:19.860
AND SO THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:21.228
BUT I THINK THAT AND I MEAN

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:22.463
AROUND BUT I THINK THE ONE ITEM

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:24.098
I WOULD SAY WITH THAT IS. THE

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:25.032
CHALLENGE FOR THOSE FUNDS YOU

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:28.035
HAVE TO. BUILD BACK TO WHAT YOU

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.804
HAD YOU CAN'T ENHANCE. IN

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:30.905
THAT'S BEEN THE CHALLENGE FOR

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:32.840
MANY COUNTIES AND THIS ASSEMBLY

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.342
WOMAN AGUIAR-CURRY AND I'VE

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.110
GONE THROUGH THAT- ESPECIALLY

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:37.345
WITH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE CDBG

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:40.081
DR FUNDS. THAT THERE'S SOME.

01:33:40.147 --> 01:33:41.349
CHALLENGES IN SOME

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:43.617
REQUIREMENTS. I THINK GOING

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:45.386
FORWARD. ARE WE GOING TO

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.154
CONTINUE TO BUILD IN THOSE HIGH

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:49.457
FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. IN

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.993
IF WE ARE- AND MANY OF THESE

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:53.828
AREAS HAVE BURNED MULTIPLE

01:33:53.894 --> 01:33:56.998
TIMES- NEEDING TO LOOK I GUESS

01:33:57.064 --> 01:34:00.067
YOU'RE TAKE- YES IS TAKE ON- NO

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:02.370
LONGER ALLOWING FOR ONE WAY AND

01:34:02.436 --> 01:34:04.005
ONE WAY OUT THAT'S A- HUGE CHU

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:05.206
POINT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:07.208
EVACUATIONS. NUMBER TWO LOOKING

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:08.909
AT MANDATED FIRE BREAKS IT HAD

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.211
TO BE MAINTAINED IN PERPETUITY

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:12.413
AS WE USED TO SEE- IN THE STATE

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.814
BUT JUST JUST GETTING TO THOSE

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:15.316
SPECIFIC ITEMS AS WE MOVE

01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:17.151
FORWARD A NEW DEVELOPMENT. AS

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:18.219
WE CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:19.587
WILL WE CONTINUE TO BUILDING

01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:21.188
THOSE HIGH FIVE OR SIX. HIGH

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.656
FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES.

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:25.092
YOUR TAKE ON DO WE NEED TO

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:26.027
UPDATE OUR STANDARDS ONCE

01:34:26.093 --> 01:34:31.365
AGAIN- FOR PROTECTION OF THESE

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:31.866
NEW DEVELOPMENTS. WELL I

01:34:31.932 --> 01:34:33.501
APPRECIATE WE ARE. THAT THE

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:34.902
COMMUNITY SAY. AND THE FACE OF

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:36.270
WILDFIRE AS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:37.872
MOST IMPORTANT. I'M AND I

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.807
APOLOGIZE IF I WASN'T CLEAR- I

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:41.609
WAS TALKING ABOUT FUNDS THAT

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:43.110
CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:44.311
SPECIFICALLY THEIR CALL HAVE A

01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:46.380
MEDICATION. THAT IS DIFFERENT

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:49.150
FROM THAT KIND OF RETURN TO ADD

01:34:49.216 --> 01:34:50.885
PRE DISASTER STATE- WHICH IS

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:52.653
ANOTHER FEMALE PROGRAM THAT.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.521
THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:55.322
FAMILIAR WITH- SO THOSE

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:57.291
PARTICULARLY COULD BE USED FOR

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.325
THINGS LIKE IMPROVING

01:34:58.392 --> 01:34:59.960
EVACUATION SAFETY VEGETATION

01:35:00.027 --> 01:35:02.797
MANAGEMENT. SO YOU KNOW WHILE

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:04.899
WE AGREE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT.

01:35:04.965 --> 01:35:06.400
AND WE HAVE PUT TO GET PUT

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:09.570
FORTH TOOLS AND IMPORTANTLY

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:11.605
LIKE REALLY CRITICAL INCENTIVES

01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:12.473
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORK

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.575
GETS DONE. ACCESSING ANY

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:16.777
FILLERS AFTER DOLLARS REQUIRES

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:18.779
SOME ELEMENT OF PLANNING AND IF

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:20.981
THOSE PLANS ARE ADOPTED INTO

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:22.783
THE GENERAL PEN PLAN GUIDANCE

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:23.884
WHICH BY THE WAY WAS UNITED

01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:25.086
BECAUSE WE EVERYONE KNOWS WAS

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:26.220

AGO- ACROSS THE BOARD. TO

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:29.790
ADDRESS BETTER DISASTER

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:31.826
RESILIENCE THEN THERE IS A

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:34.228
POSSIBILITY TO EXPAND FUNDS

INCENTIVIZE. BETTER

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:43.804
PREPAREDNESS BETTER RESILIENCE

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:45.773
YEAH- YOU KNOW THOSE DOLLARS

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.908

BECAUSE OF. SO MUCH THAT HAS

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:51.645
HAPPENED HERE WE WANT TO

01:35:51.712 --> 01:35:53.080
LEVERAGE THOSE DOLLARS TO THE

01:35:53.147 --> 01:35:54.515
MAXIMUM BENEFITS TO PROTECT

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:57.551
COMMUNITIES. AGAINST WILDFIRES

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:58.886

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:01.055
THESE ARE ALL HAZARDS. PROGRAMS

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:02.690

OUR POPULATION INCLUDING. FLOOD

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:10.598
RISK AS WE TALKED ABOUT

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:13.067
EARLIER. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:15.202
EARTHQUAKE REST SO THOSE ARE

ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN REGARDS TO

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:40.227
THE FUNDS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:41.929
JUST NOT ENOUGH RIGHT. TO BE

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.898
ABLE TO DO BEFORE THAT'S WHY I

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:46.300
WANTED TO GET YOUR YOUR TAKE

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:47.902
ON- UPDATING STANDARDS

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:48.936
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE UPDATED

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:50.571
BUILDING CODES. BUT LOOKING AT

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.273
UPDATING POTENTIAL STANDARDS

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:53.107
FOR DEVELOPMENT SPECIALLY IN

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:54.742
THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:58.212
ZONES IT SENATE BILL TWENTY TWO

01:36:58.279 --> 01:36:59.313
WHICH IS JACKSON'S BILL. WOULD

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:02.049
HAVE. PUT A PAUSE ON THAT KNOW

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:03.117
THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS IN

01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:04.418
REGARDS TO THE RENEWED CYCLE ON

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:05.619
HOW THAT WOULD HAVE MESSED UP.

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:07.655
THIS UPCOMING RENEWAL CYCLE AT

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.290
THE SAME TIME THOUGH. WE

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.759
CONTINUE TO BUILD IN AREAS THAT

01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:12.326
HAVE BEEN HIT BY WHILE THEM

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:17.231
FIRE. TWO THREE TIMES- AND- IT

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:19.333
IS IT IS IT TIME FOR THE STATE

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.468
TO START. IMPLEMENTING A

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:22.536
PROGRAM VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:24.672
WE'VE DONE WITH FLOODING WHERE-

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:25.873
AND IT'S A SENIOR PROGRAMMER WE

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:28.509
BUY OUT THOSE BUILDING RIGHTS.

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:31.045
COMPENSATE THOSE. FOLKS WHO ARE

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:32.713
IN A FLOOD ZONE SO THAT WE

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.114
DON'T CONTINUE TO SEE THOSE

01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:36.750
INSURANCE LOSSES AND THE PUBLIC

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:37.818
PICKING UP THE TIME TO BE ABLE

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:39.153
TO REBUILD. SO I THINK THAT'S

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:40.221
WHAT WE'RE GETTING TO THAT

01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:41.622
POINT IN THE STATE ESPECIALLY

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:43.691
AFTER A SEASON THAT WE SEEM TO

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:45.926
FOUR MILLION ACRES I THINK IT'S

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:47.061
GOING TO BE CRITICAL DISCUSSION

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:47.928
OF THE LEGISLATURE IS GONNA

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:49.530
HAVE TO HAVE CONTROVERSIAL ONE

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:51.765
TOUGH ONE BUT- ONE THAT I THINK

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:52.933
IT'S GONNA TO HIT THANK YOU SO

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.134
MUCH AND MAY TAKE UP SO MUCH

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:55.603
TIME MAKING THEM TO BE DIRECTOR

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:58.906
THINKING AFTER. THANK YOU

BE REAL QUICK I HAVE ONE VERY-

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:14.922
IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ME AND I

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:17.191
THINK IT'S ONE OF OUR MORE-

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:18.158
VULNERABLE PARTS OF OUR

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:19.460
POPULATION IS SO EASILY

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:20.794
OVERLOOKED OR PEOPLE THAT HAVE

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:23.731
COMMUNICATION. A DISABILITIES

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:25.699
DO DO WE HAVE ANY SYSTEM IN

01:38:25.766 --> 01:38:28.769
PLACE THAT HELPS US IDENTIFY-

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:30.938
WHERE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE MAY

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:32.773
BE RESIDING OR ANY KIND OF A-

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.642
SPECIAL WAY TO COMMUNICATE I'M

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:35.943
I'M SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:38.112
VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE AND

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:40.047
ALSO- HEARING IMPAIRED PEOPLE.

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:42.349
OF THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:43.784
ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SAME PATH OF

01:38:43.851 --> 01:38:45.386
COMMUNICATION THAT MANY OF US

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:47.054
WHO DON'T SHARE THOSE THOSE

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:48.822
CHALLENGES HAVE. AND I THINK

01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:50.457
THEY'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS SOME

01:38:50.524 --> 01:38:51.892
OF THE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:53.560
AND HELD THAT THERE WAS REALLY

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:55.396
NO RECOGNITION OR- SPECIAL

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:57.431
PATHWAY TO. REACH OUT AND

01:38:57.498 --> 01:38:58.599
IDENTIFY AND I KNOW THAT THIS

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:01.068
WOULD REQUIRE EXTRA COOPERATION

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:02.836
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT I DO

01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:04.138
THINK THAT IT IT GETS UNDER

01:39:04.204 --> 01:39:06.573
EMPHASIZED I'VE WONDERED. YOUR

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.943
THOUGHTS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK

YOU FOR THAT QUESTION

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:14.481
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. ISSUE WE-

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:16.517
JUST TO KIND OF TRY TO MAKE

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:18.018
ASSISTING TO RESPONSE THE BUT

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:20.454
IT BUT IMPORTANT- TO TALK ABOUT

01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:21.689
IS WE DO HAVE AN OFFICE OF

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:23.090
ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:46.599
HARD WORK THE MIX IS DOCUMENTS

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.768

STRATEGY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE US

01:57:09.956 --> 01:57:14.026
FORWARD. AND WHY IS A STRATEGY

01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:16.095
IMPORTANT. FOR FROM INCIDENT

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:16.929
MANAGE FIRST IT DOESN'T MATTER

01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:19.499
IF WE'RE RESPOND. TO A NEED. AT

CALLING THEM NOW WILL MAKE A

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:27.173
FIRE IN TATING CALIFORNIA. IT

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.074
ALL BEGINS WITH THIS DISCOUNT

01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:30.743
WISHING A SET OF COMMON- WIDELY

01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:32.245
KNOWN OBJECTIVES THEY WERE

PUT IT DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO

01:57:39.752 --> 01:57:41.220

TASKS- JUST BEEN ARE PAIRED IN.

01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:46.826
OUR OPINION AND EXPERIENCE AS

FUEL MANAGEMENT AND- BUT JUST A

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:57.136
TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:57:57.203 --> 01:57:58.571
WORK YOU KNOW THE CHAMPIONSHIP

01:57:58.638 --> 01:57:59.872
THAT'S BEEN DONE WITH SENATOR

01:57:59.939 --> 01:58:01.774
JACKSON OF THE WORK SHE'S DONE

01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:03.576

HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:06.112
ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:09.248
DONE- WE'D LIKE TO. PROPOSE AND

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:11.317
PUT ON THE TABLE CONSIDERATION

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:13.152
OF ADOPTING OR HIM. OR

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:15.021
LEGISLATING THAT WE WORK

TOWARDS BUILDING A

01:58:16.255 --> 01:58:17.790
COMPREHENSIVE A COHESIVE

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:20.159
OVERARCHING STRATEGY. SO THAT

01:58:20.226 --> 01:58:21.360
SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:24.897
HAVING TODAY WHETHER IT'S WE-SHOULD HAVE ONE COMMUNICATION.

01:58:24.964 --> 01:58:26.699
SYSTEM STATEWIDE ORDERED SHOULD

01:58:26.766 --> 01:58:27.834
BE TO CENTRALIZED IN THE

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:28.501
COUNTIES OF THE LOCAL

01:58:28.568 --> 01:58:30.236
GOVERNMENTS. WERE THAT

01:58:30.303 --> 01:58:31.838
CONVERSATION WOULD BE POINTED

01:58:31.904 --> 01:58:33.439
BACK TO YOU ONE OF THE COMMON

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:34.373
OBJECTIVES WHAT IS THE

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:35.842
OBJECTIVE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:38.478
ACHIEVE. DOES IT MATTER IF EACH

01:58:38.544 --> 01:58:39.846
SYSTEM IN EACH COUNTY IS ON A

01:58:39.912 --> 01:58:41.247
DIFFERENT SYSTEM AND CAN'T

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:42.815
NECESSARILY OVERLAP WANTED

01:58:42.882 --> 01:58:44.917
EITHER. OR WOULD BE BETTER OFF

01:58:44.984 --> 01:58:47.153
HAVING WON STATEWIDE SYSTEM.

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:48.120
SOME OF THE ELEMENTS IN MY

01:58:48.187 --> 01:58:50.723
OPINION IN OUR OPINION THAT

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:52.091
NEED TO BE INCLUDED LOOKING AT.

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:53.726
AND KNOW WE MADE SOME STRIDES

01:58:53.793 --> 01:58:55.127
IN STARTING WITH SOMEBODY JUST

01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:57.430
LIKE XINLAST YEAR MAYBE AB

01:58:57.497 --> 01:58:58.231
THIRTY ONE SIXTY FOUR. AND

01:58:58.297 --> 01:58:59.899
THAT'S MOVING FROM THE HAZARD

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:01.400
BASED OR THE HAZARDS OWN

01:59:01.467 --> 01:59:02.969
MODELING TO A RISK BASED

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:11.210
MODELING APPROACH. THIS IS

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:13.713
TAKING. TAKING A PER. OF QUERY

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:16.182
GLOW. IN WHICH- HAZARDS VERY

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:17.917
ARE EXIT. BUT DOESN'T TAKE IN

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:18.885
ACCOUNT ANYTHING BEEN DONE THE

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:20.753
STRUCTURE TO MAKE MEMORIES. TO

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.822
BE ABLE TO. A WILDFIRE. IT

01:59:22.889 --> 01:59:23.956
DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

01:59:24.023 --> 01:59:25.658
ROADWAYS OR THE WITH THE- WHEN

01:59:25.725 --> 01:59:26.492
THERE'S NO WAYS IN MORE WAYS

01:59:26.559 --> 01:59:28.928
OUT ITS WAY THE- IS CHEN LOW.

01:59:28.995 --> 01:59:30.463
IN WALL. IT MAKES SENSE THOUGH

01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:32.765
USE THAT. PRO BECAUSE HAZARD

01:59:32.832 --> 01:59:34.333
FAIRLY STATIC IT DOESN'T CHANGE

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:37.003
RIDLEY I'M A RISK IS FAR MORE

01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:38.237
DYNAMIC SOMEBODY COULD NOT

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:40.273
HIRE. FOLKS TO COME OUT AND

01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:41.507
CLEAN THEIR PARCEL OFTEN IT CAN

01:59:41.574 --> 01:59:42.842
CHANGE FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT

01:59:42.909 --> 01:59:44.610
SO CAN BECOME VERY. DYNAMIC BUT

01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:46.045
I ALSO BELIEVE IT'S VERY

01:59:46.112 --> 01:59:49.682
IMPORTANT. AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:59:49.749 --> 01:59:50.249
MOVE FORWARD. WE NEED TO PUT

01:59:50.316 --> 01:59:51.317
GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE NUMBER

01:59:51.384 --> 01:59:52.885
REASONS OF STRUCTURES WE'VE

01:59:52.952 --> 01:59:55.221
MADE GREAT STRIDES WITH THE

01:59:55.288 --> 01:59:57.089
WILDFIRE CODE IN THE STATE BUT

01:59:57.156 --> 01:59:58.791
THERE'S STILL MORE WORK NEEDS

01:59:58.858 --> 01:59:59.625
TO BE DONE IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:01.661
AREA. AS WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE

02:00:01.727 --> 02:00:03.195
WITH THE WESTERN FIRE CHIEFS

02:00:03.262 --> 02:00:04.564

VULNERABILITIES THAT EXISTED

02:00:08.134 --> 02:00:09.869
ALL STRUCTURES IS THE CONTINUE

02:00:09.936 --> 02:00:13.005
TO EXIST. IN THAT WE TALKED

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:14.807
ALSO ABOUT THE- PARTNERSHIPS

02:00:14.874 --> 02:00:16.075
WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

02:00:16.142 --> 02:00:18.544
FROM FROM RISK MODELING TO

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:20.046
ACTUARIAL WORK BUT MORE

02:00:20.112 --> 02:00:21.514
IMPORTANTLY BEING ABLE TO

BUSINESS AND HOME SAFETY. WHERE

02:00:26.719 --> 02:00:28.688
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IS

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:30.056
EIGHT NEW CHURCH INDUSTRY

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:32.558
ALONE. TESTING LABORATORY WHO

BECAUSE EVERY HOME IN THE STATE

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:11.931

02:17:31.109 --> 02:17:33.278
ON THE NEXT PHASE IS OPERATION

JACKSON DECISION TIME WARNING

02:17:51.096 --> 02:17:53.064
TIME. BUT IF THE COMMUNITY IS

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:55.000
NOT PREPARED TO GO YOU'RE GOING

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:57.135
TO HAVE CHALLENGES. FINALLY IS

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:59.137
NETWORK CLEARING TIME HOW LONG

02:17:59.204 --> 02:18:00.872
DOES IT TAKE TO CLEAR UP A

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:02.607
PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD. OR

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:04.442
PARTICULAR AREA GENERALLY THIS

02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:05.944
IS THE RANGE. THERE'S A MILLION

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:08.179
WAYS TO FELLOW DOCUMENTATION. I

02:18:08.246 --> 02:18:12.183
WHETHER IT'S. A CAR CRASH OR-

02:18:12.250 --> 02:18:14.352
ALL ON BOARD FALLING ACROSS

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:16.621
YOUR- AND SO ON. THE RANGER OF

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:20.025
TIME. IS THE SAME. IF YOU ARE

02:18:20.091 --> 02:18:21.960
IN ALL OF FACE ARE WHICH ALL

02:18:22.027 --> 02:18:24.462
COULD YOU SOME. SOME FOR. ON

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:26.464
THIS IS YOUR EVACUATION TIME

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:27.866
AND- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:18:27.932 --> 02:18:29.534
COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND AT

02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:32.404
LEAST HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF

02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:34.572
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING. SO WE'RE

02:18:34.639 --> 02:18:36.641
FOCUSED ON AREAS THAT ENHANCE

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:38.276
AND STREAMLINE EACH PHASE OF

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:39.678
THE EVACUATION OF THE SPEECH

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:41.513
FROM. LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:18:41.579 --> 02:18:43.782
PERSPECTIVE HERE ON THE FIRST

02:18:43.848 --> 02:18:44.382
MARKET THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:46.017
COMMUNITY EDUCATION NOT REACH

02:18:46.084 --> 02:18:47.852
RELATING TO THAT QUESTIONS. I

02:18:47.919 --> 02:18:49.754
JUST SAID WE STRUGGLE TO REACH

02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:51.790
ALL POPULATION SEGMENTS THREE

02:18:51.856 --> 02:18:53.024
MULTI MODAL APPROACH USING

02:18:53.091 --> 02:18:54.959
TECHNOLOGY AND LAST SECOND

02:18:55.026 --> 02:18:57.262
TECHNOLOGICAL METHODS. IF WE

02:18:57.328 --> 02:18:58.430
COULD IMPROVE THIS WE WOULD

02:18:58.496 --> 02:19:01.800
FACILITATE COMMUNITY PROPER

02:19:01.866 --> 02:19:03.301
TAXES. SO THE QUESTION IS DOES

02:19:03.368 --> 02:19:05.336
THE COMMUNITY IT DOES THE

02:19:05.403 --> 02:19:06.271
COMMUNITY KERR IS THE COMMUNITY

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:08.206
SIGNED UP FOR ALERTS WARNINGS

02:19:08.273 --> 02:19:09.641

02:19:09.708 --> 02:19:10.975
COMPLAINING RESPONSIBILITIES

02:19:11.042 --> 02:19:12.944
DURING EVACUATION. I BELIEVE

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:14.145
THAT WE ARE ONLY PENETRATING

02:19:14.212 --> 02:19:16.614
APPROXIMATELY 25% ALTHOUGH WHEN

02:19:16.681 --> 02:19:17.816
THERE SEEMS TO BE SMOKE IN THE

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:20.885
AIR WE PENETRATE. FAR MORE.

02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:22.620
PRINT OUT PREVENTATIVE

02:19:22.687 --> 02:19:23.455
COMMUNICATIONS BEFORE

02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:25.657
EVACUATION ASCENTIAL CANNOT

02:19:25.724 --> 02:19:27.092
UNDERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF

02:19:27.158 --> 02:19:28.326
STRUCTURAL HARDENING THAT

02:19:28.393 --> 02:19:29.994

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:31.329
FIRE SAFE COUNCILS WOULD

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:33.598
FACILITATE COMMUNITY PRACTICES

02:19:33.665 --> 02:19:35.600
AND OUR CURRENT. IF THE

02:19:35.667 --> 02:19:37.335

02:19:37.402 --> 02:19:39.237
AND- DEFINITE EXPERIENCE

FIRE I WHEN THEY ARE BURNING IT

02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:47.579
IS A FAR MORE DANGEROUS. WE

02:19:47.645 --> 02:19:48.613
FUNDING TO ASSIST WITH

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.850

IF HE'S REPORTING A FIRE THAT

02:39:33.730 --> 02:39:36.133

02:39:36.199 --> 02:39:37.367
THOUSAND ACRES IN AN HOUR

THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY- WILL

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.402
SOMBER FAMILIAR TO YOU I THINK

02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:33.503
THAT THEY'RE WORTHY OF

EMPHASIZING AND SO IN

02:43:35.305 --> 02:43:37.240
PARTICULAR I'M GONNA EMPHASIZE

02:43:37.307 --> 02:43:38.441
SOME OF THINGS THAT CHIEF WELCH

02:43:38.508 --> 02:43:40.410

02:43:40.477 --> 02:43:42.279
THAT PRESIDENT ARE RISING SENT.

02:43:42.345 --> 02:43:43.413
ALERT AND WARNING AND

02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:45.849
EVACUATION COORDINATION IS A

02:43:45.916 --> 02:43:48.885
VERY VERY COMPLEX OPERATION IT

02:43:48.952 --> 02:43:52.455
IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE HAD A

02:43:52.522 --> 02:43:54.591
GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH- AS THE

02:43:54.658 --> 02:43:56.593
SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY HAVING

02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:59.262
SUFFERED. THROUGH A NUMBER OF

02:43:59.329 --> 02:44:03.099
MAJOR DISASTERS AND- AS A

02:44:03.166 --> 02:44:05.268
MEMBER OF THE SICILIAN AND

02:44:05.335 --> 02:44:06.636
REPRESENTS AS A CITY TODAY.

02:44:06.703 --> 02:44:07.470
I'VE HAVE YET TO SPEAK WITH MY

02:44:07.537 --> 02:44:12.175
COLLEAGUES ROTH STATE YOU. GET

02:44:12.242 --> 02:44:12.709
THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THESE

02:44:12.776 --> 02:44:13.710
KINDS OF THINGS AS WELL- WHAT I

02:44:13.777 --> 02:44:14.344
CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. THE

02:44:14.411 --> 02:44:15.812
COMPLEXITY THAT WE DEAL WITH

02:44:15.879 --> 02:44:16.980
WHEN IT COMES TO ALERT AND

02:44:17.047 --> 02:44:18.848
WARNING IS REALLY NOT

02:44:18.915 --> 02:44:21.051
UNDERSTOOD. BY MANY MEMBERS OF

02:44:21.117 --> 02:44:22.652
THE COMMUNITY IT'S OFTEN NOT

02:44:22.719 --> 02:44:24.588
UNDERSTOOD BY THE PEOPLE

02:44:24.654 --> 02:44:26.756
OUTSIDE OF. THE EMERGENCY

02:44:26.823 --> 02:44:28.558
MANAGEMENT ROUND YEAH I THINK

02:44:28.625 --> 02:44:30.794
THAT LENDS TO. INCREASE

02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:32.629
DIFFICULTY IN TERMS OF GETTING

02:44:32.696 --> 02:44:34.364
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR

02:44:34.431 --> 02:44:36.800
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. EVEN

02:44:36.866 --> 02:44:39.035
BEFORE THE ALERT AND WARNING-

02:44:39.102 --> 02:44:41.071
IS REQUIRED. THE FACT MATTERS

02:44:41.137 --> 02:44:43.173
THIS IF WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE

02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:44.274
WE HAVE TO ISSUE AN ALERT AND

02:44:44.341 --> 02:44:47.477
WARNING BECAUSE OF OPINION A

02:44:47.544 --> 02:44:49.145
DISASTER HAZARD OR CRISIS. WELL

02:44:49.212 --> 02:44:51.581
WE ARE ALREADY BEHIND THE CURVE

02:44:51.648 --> 02:44:53.316
IF YOU WILL. BUT THE FACT IS

02:44:53.383 --> 02:44:54.851
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES NO

02:44:54.918 --> 02:44:56.720
MATTER WHAT KIND OF PREPARATION

02:44:56.786 --> 02:44:58.555
WE HAVE DONE AHEAD OF TIME WHAT

02:44:58.622 --> 02:45:00.090
KIND OF SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN

02:45:00.156 --> 02:45:01.825
PLACE WITH REGARD TO ALERT AND

02:45:01.891 --> 02:45:03.326
WARNING. THERE IS NO WAY TO

02:45:03.393 --> 02:45:05.929
GUARANTEE 1100% SATURATION OF

02:45:05.996 --> 02:45:07.631
YOUR MESSAGE AND THERE'S NO WAY

02:45:07.697 --> 02:45:08.999
TO GUARANTEE THAT PEOPLE WILL

02:45:09.065 --> 02:45:11.101
DO WHAT YOU ASK THEM TO DO. AND

02:45:11.167 --> 02:45:14.704
SO TO EXPECT A PERFECT OUTCOME.

02:45:14.771 --> 02:45:20.343
IS IN MY VIEW- PROBABLY- AN

02:45:20.410 --> 02:45:20.844
EXPECTATION THAT ISN'T

02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:22.679
REALISTIC SO THAT'S WHY I THINK

02:45:22.746 --> 02:45:24.381
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOCUS

02:45:24.447 --> 02:45:26.750
ON THE FRONT END OF PREVENTION

02:45:26.816 --> 02:45:29.486
AND- INSURING THAT WE'RE A

02:45:29.552 --> 02:45:30.620
BETTER POSITION TO PREVENT

02:45:30.687 --> 02:45:33.356
THESE KINDS OF. INCIDENTS IN

02:45:33.423 --> 02:45:35.492
CRISIS TO FROM CURRENT FIRST

02:45:35.558 --> 02:45:36.126
PLACE OR THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

02:45:36.192 --> 02:45:39.396
BE CONTROLLED. MUCH MUCH

02:45:39.462 --> 02:45:39.929
QUICKER IN IN IN A BETTER

02:45:39.996 --> 02:45:41.998
FASHION. AND THAT REQUIRES A

02:45:42.065 --> 02:45:42.832
LEVEL OF PERSONAL

02:45:42.899 --> 02:45:44.167
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PART OF

02:45:44.234 --> 02:45:45.435
MEMBERS MARCH MEDIAN THAT'S

02:45:45.502 --> 02:45:47.337
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO BE LOST

02:45:47.404 --> 02:45:48.438
IN A LOT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS

02:45:48.505 --> 02:45:50.507
IS. ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT IS- YES

02:45:50.573 --> 02:45:51.708
DOING WORK FOR THE COUNTY IS

02:45:51.775 --> 02:45:53.209
DOING WHAT IS LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:45:53.276 --> 02:45:55.211
AND WHAT AS FAR DOING. BUT PART

02:45:55.278 --> 02:45:57.414
OF THIS EQUATION IS WHAT ARE

02:45:57.480 --> 02:45:58.882
THE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMUNITY

02:45:58.948 --> 02:46:02.085
DOING TO. BE PREPARED AND TO BE

02:46:02.152 --> 02:46:04.621
TUNED IN TO WHAT'S GOING ON IF

02:46:04.688 --> 02:46:07.257
YOU WILLING TO. DO WHAT THEY'RE

02:46:07.324 --> 02:46:08.725
BEING ASKED TO DO BY THOSE

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:10.327
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE BEST

02:46:10.393 --> 02:46:11.328
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE

02:46:11.394 --> 02:46:14.664
THREAT YES. I'LL REITERATE

02:46:14.731 --> 02:46:17.500
SHORT. WHAT OF WHAT THAT'LL- IS

02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:18.635
JUST BECAUSE I THINK SUPPORT

02:46:18.702 --> 02:46:19.969
FOR YOUR STAND THAT. IS YOU

02:46:20.036 --> 02:46:22.272
HEARD FROM CHIEF WELCH THE

02:46:22.339 --> 02:46:24.040
FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THAT. WE

02:46:24.107 --> 02:46:26.109
HAVE TO COME TO KNOW ABOUT THE

02:46:26.176 --> 02:46:28.912
THREAT AND THAT REQUIRES US TO

02:46:28.978 --> 02:46:30.847
BUT IN IN IN IN BOTH FIRES FAR

02:46:30.914 --> 02:46:32.215
SIDE AS WELL AS LONG FOR

02:46:32.282 --> 02:46:34.217
SOCIETY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

02:46:34.284 --> 02:46:37.087
THREAT IS. FIRE OR FLOOD OR

02:46:37.153 --> 02:46:40.290
POTENTIAL OF. REACH A DAM OR

02:46:40.357 --> 02:46:41.758
TSUNAMI OR TORNADO OR WHATEVER

02:46:41.825 --> 02:46:43.526
THAT WHATEVER THE SITUATION WE

02:46:43.593 --> 02:46:44.961
MIGHT BEGIN WITH THERE'S THIS

02:46:45.028 --> 02:46:46.062
PERIOD OF TIME WHERE YOU HAVE

02:46:46.129 --> 02:46:47.664
TO. COME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

02:46:47.731 --> 02:46:49.199
THREAT IS AND THEN WHAT THE

02:46:49.265 --> 02:46:51.468
APPROPRIATE RESPONSES AND THAT

02:46:51.534 --> 02:46:53.837
TAKES TIME. BEYOND THAT THERE

02:46:53.903 --> 02:46:56.172
IS THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE

CLEAR MESSAGE AS TO WHAT THE

02:47:20.330 --> 02:47:23.199
THREAT IS. HONESTLY BOOKS. THAT

02:47:23.266 --> 02:47:25.869
IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE

COMMUNICATE THAT IT ISN'T

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:39.082
ALWAYS AS EASY OR AS QUICK AS

02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:40.750
YOU WORK AS ONE MIGHT THINK NOW

02:47:40.817 --> 02:47:42.252
WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS LOCALLY

02:47:42.318 --> 02:47:44.854
TO TRY TO. SHORTEN THAT WINDOW

02:47:44.921 --> 02:47:47.424
OF A TIME WE CAN'T MESSAGES

02:47:55.965 --> 02:47:57.133
DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.035
DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT HAVE

TO BE COMMUNICATED AND AGAIN

02:48:00.904 --> 02:48:02.305
PUTTING THAT IN A SUCCINCT

MESSAGE ACROSS MULTIPLE

02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:14.818
PLATFORMS THE FACT OF THE

02:48:14.884 --> 02:48:18.755
MATTER IS THAT NO ONE LISTENS.

02:48:18.822 --> 02:48:19.456
NO ONE LISTENS TO A SINGLE

02:48:19.522 --> 02:48:21.891

UPON CELLPHONES. WELL THAT I

02:48:30.366 --> 02:48:31.901
ITS CONCERNS ABOUT BECAUSE

02:48:31.968 --> 02:48:33.903
QUITE FRANKLY I THINK. NOT ONLY

02:48:33.970 --> 02:48:35.338
DOES THE GOVERNMENT BUT DID THE

02:48:35.405 --> 02:48:37.006
PUBLIC ALSO BECOMES OVER

TIME AGAIN. BUT THAT DOESN'T

02:48:42.645 --> 02:48:44.314
ALWAYS WORK THE SYSTEMS GO DOWN

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:45.915

DIFFERENT VENDORS THAT PROVIDE

02:49:01.531 --> 02:49:03.666
THAT IT. MAYBE IT'S WORTH WHILE

02:49:03.733 --> 02:49:05.468

02:51:36.185 --> 02:51:39.455
WAY. TO GET PEOPLE TO EVACUATE.

02:51:39.522 --> 02:51:41.157
THIS FOR A LONG FORCING OFFICER

02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:42.692

MATTER IS. THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL

02:51:52.135 --> 02:51:53.503
ESPECIALLY IN THESE. RAPIDLY

02:51:53.569 --> 02:51:54.804
EVOLVING SITUATIONS LIKE THE

ENOUGH FIRE ENGINES AND THERE

02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:06.616
WERE NOT ENOUGH **** IN A

02:52:06.683 --> 02:52:09.118
PROBABLY THE STATE CALIFORNIA

02:52:09.185 --> 02:52:10.787
TO PREVENT THAT FIRE FROM

02:52:18.294 --> 02:52:18.828
THINGS THAT WE ARE FACING HERE

02:52:18.895 --> 02:52:22.231
IN CALIFORNIA. BUT TO MITIGATE.

02:52:22.298 --> 02:52:25.001
B. FACT THAT THERE'S NO WAY FOR

US TO GO DOOR TO DOOR KNOCK IN

02:52:26.536 --> 02:52:27.837
A RUN STORE. A WE IMPLEMENTED

02:52:27.904 --> 02:52:30.039
THE HIGH LOW SIREN AS MUCH AS

THAT I THINK THAT'S A- A GREAT

02:52:36.145 --> 02:52:36.679
PROGRAM THAT WE CAN ALSO BUILD

INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS SO THEY CAN

02:53:38.074 --> 02:53:40.276
ULTIMATELY- GET OUT OF THAT

02:53:40.343 --> 02:53:42.712
AREA WAS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

02:53:42.779 --> 02:53:44.380
BUT THE ONE VARIABLE HERE THAT

02:53:44.447 --> 02:53:46.549
IS SO DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. OR

02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:48.451
PEOPLE. IN THE FACT OF THE

02:53:48.518 --> 02:53:51.320
MATTER IS THIS. MANY PEOPLE NO

02:53:51.387 --> 02:53:53.990
THE THREAT IS COMING. THEY ARE

02:53:54.056 --> 02:53:54.891
CURRENT EITHER THROUGH AN

02:53:54.957 --> 02:53:56.826
OFFICIAL SOURCE OR THROUGH A

02:53:56.893 --> 02:53:58.728
RELIABLE SOURCE OF THAT THE

02:53:58.795 --> 02:54:00.196
THREAT IS COMING BUT THEY

02:54:00.263 --> 02:54:01.497
CHOOSE NOT TO FOLLOW THE

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:05.001
DIRECTIONS WE CHOOSE NOT TO

02:54:05.067 --> 02:54:07.537
HEED THE ADVICE I CAN'T TELL

02:54:07.603 --> 02:54:08.137
YOU. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:10.973
I. BIRD TELL ME VERY A

02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:11.808
HARROWING STORIES ABOUT

02:54:11.874 --> 02:54:12.875
ESCAPING THE FLAMES AND

02:54:12.942 --> 02:54:15.711
CAMPFIRE AND THEN MOST RECENTLY

02:54:15.778 --> 02:54:18.047
HERE IN INDICATING THE VERIFIER-

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:20.550
ALL OF THAT BEGIN WITH WELL WE

02:54:20.616 --> 02:54:21.384
WEREN'T SURE IF WE SHOULD

02:54:21.450 --> 02:54:23.319
EVACUATE WE WANTED TO WAIT TO

02:54:23.386 --> 02:54:26.189
SEE IF THE FIRE WAS COMING- WE

02:54:26.255 --> 02:54:28.291
ARE ULTIMATELY DID EVACUATE

02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:29.759
UNTIL WE SAW THE FLAMES AND-

02:54:29.826 --> 02:54:32.662
FRANKLY UP BY THAT POINT IT'S

02:54:32.728 --> 02:54:34.864
TOO LATE. AND REGRETTABLY A

02:54:34.931 --> 02:54:35.598
NUMBER OF PEOPLE PERISHED IN

02:54:35.665 --> 02:54:37.533
THAT FIRE FAMILY MEMBERS TOLD

02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:38.701
US THE SAME KIND OF THING

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:40.136
DEBATE THE NEW THE THREAT WAS

02:54:40.203 --> 02:54:42.004
COMING BUT THEY CHOSE NOT TO

02:54:42.071 --> 02:54:44.941
EVACUATE. ON FOR NUMBER OF

02:54:45.007 --> 02:54:48.010
REASONS. ALL OFTENTIMES WILL

02:54:48.077 --> 02:54:48.644
NOT DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THEIR%

02:54:48.711 --> 02:54:50.746
HOME. AND IT BECOMES A VERY

02:54:50.813 --> 02:54:51.347
VERY DIFFICULT PROPOSITION FOR

02:54:51.414 --> 02:54:53.583
US DEAL. NOW THERE WAS THERE

02:54:53.649 --> 02:54:56.052
WAS A- SOME SOME COMMENTS

02:54:56.118 --> 02:54:58.187
EARLY- OR WHAT JOBS EMAILED ME

02:54:58.254 --> 02:54:59.322
WITH REGARD TO THAT AND THE

02:54:59.388 --> 02:55:00.690
FACT MATTERS I DON'T THINK

02:55:00.756 --> 02:55:03.025
YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE THAT

02:55:03.092 --> 02:55:05.261
FOLKS. ON YOU. YOU CAN ISSUE AN

02:55:05.328 --> 02:55:06.929
ORDER. AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:55:06.996 --> 02:55:10.633
OFFICER. IF A PERSON REFUSES TO

02:55:10.700 --> 02:55:11.701
OBEY THE ORDER IN ONE OF THE

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:13.502
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE YOU BELIEVE

02:55:13.569 --> 02:55:15.538
THE VIOLATION OF THE LAW IT'S A

02:55:15.605 --> 02:55:17.473
MISDEMEANOR CRIME BUT IN A

02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:19.575
PRACTICAL SENSE YOU CAN'T GO

02:55:19.642 --> 02:55:21.510
ABOUT ARRESTING PEOPLE IN

02:55:21.577 --> 02:55:22.845
TRANSPORTING THEM TO JAIL

02:55:22.912 --> 02:55:24.280
BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO LEAVE

02:55:24.347 --> 02:55:26.782
COLLEGE OPTICAL SERVICES TO GET

02:55:26.849 --> 02:55:28.017
THEIR KIDS CALLING ANIMAL

02:55:28.084 --> 02:55:28.985
CONTROL TO GET THEIR OWN

02:55:29.051 --> 02:55:30.419
BECAUSE- WHILE YOU'RE DOING

02:55:30.486 --> 02:55:31.854
THAT. YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON THE

02:55:31.921 --> 02:55:33.823
OPPORTUNITY TO ALERT AND HELP

02:55:33.890 --> 02:55:35.458
EVACUATE MANY OTHER PEOPLE I

02:55:35.524 --> 02:55:37.960
DON'T THINK THAT'S ULTIMATELY

02:55:38.027 --> 02:55:39.929
THE ANSWER THE QUESTION. WHAT I

02:55:39.996 --> 02:55:44.834
DO THINK IS A BETTER USE OF OUR

02:55:44.901 --> 02:55:46.068
TIME AND RESOURCES IS ONE. WE

02:55:46.135 --> 02:55:47.937
NEED TO REALLY INVEST IN

02:55:48.004 --> 02:55:49.572
PREVENTING THESE THINGS FROM

02:55:49.639 --> 02:55:51.107
OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:55:51.173 --> 02:55:58.214
AND THAT MEANS- DEALING WITH UN.

02:55:58.281 --> 02:55:59.715
THE FUEL LOADS THAT WE'RE

02:55:59.782 --> 02:56:01.884
DEALING WITH IN IN. THE RURAL

02:56:01.951 --> 02:56:04.320
AREAS AND THE FIRES MAKING SURE

02:56:04.387 --> 02:56:05.788
THAT THERE IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:56:05.855 --> 02:56:07.556
AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A

02:56:07.623 --> 02:56:10.760
ROBUST ROBUST A CHAMP PAYNE A

02:56:10.826 --> 02:56:12.328
TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:56:12.395 --> 02:56:14.764
IMPORTANCE. OF PREPARING HAVE

02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:18.501
YOUR PLAN IN PLACE TUNING IN TO

02:56:18.567 --> 02:56:19.902
THE VARIOUS METHODS IN WHICH WE

02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:22.238
COMMUNICATE AND BE READY TO GO

02:56:22.305 --> 02:56:24.307
AND GOING HOME WE ASK THEM TO I

02:56:24.373 --> 02:56:25.775
THINK ULTIMATELY GAINING THAT

02:56:25.841 --> 02:56:26.809
KIND OF COMPLIANCE FOR MANY

02:56:26.876 --> 02:56:29.111
FROM OUT IN FIRST PLACE AGAIN

02:56:29.178 --> 02:56:29.712
THAT COMPLIANCE IS GOING TO BE

02:56:29.779 --> 02:56:31.747
A MUCH MUCH BETTER A SOLUTION

02:56:31.814 --> 02:56:33.616
TO THE PROBLEM. THE LAST THING

02:56:33.683 --> 02:56:35.718
THAT I WANT TO JUST BRING TO

02:56:35.785 --> 02:56:36.385
YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S

02:56:36.452 --> 02:56:38.955
SOMETHING THAT. I BECAME MORE

02:56:39.021 --> 02:56:39.989
AND MORE FAMILIAR WITH IN THE

02:56:40.056 --> 02:56:41.724
LAST PART OF THE BILL THAT AND

02:56:41.791 --> 02:56:43.292
THAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE

02:56:43.359 --> 02:56:44.994
PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS

02:56:45.061 --> 02:56:46.662
ON SOME OF OUR VERY RURAL

02:56:46.729 --> 02:56:48.564
COMMUNITY. NOW THERE'S BEEN

02:56:48.631 --> 02:56:50.032
SOME TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO

02:56:50.099 --> 02:56:51.934
HAVE A SEVENTY TWO HOUR-

02:56:52.001 --> 02:56:53.636
GENERATORS ARE BACKUP

02:56:53.703 --> 02:56:55.404
GENERATORS WERE CELL SITES AND

02:56:55.471 --> 02:56:57.239
THAT'S GREAT AS LONG AS YOU'VE

02:56:57.306 --> 02:57:02.278
GOT CELL SERVICE. BUT THERE ARE

02:57:02.345 --> 02:57:03.112
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. IN AND RUN

02:57:03.179 --> 02:57:05.214
REMOTE CAL. WHERE THEY HAVE

02:57:05.281 --> 02:57:07.249
CELLS. AND SO WHAT THEY RELY

02:57:07.316 --> 02:57:10.453
UPON. IS CONNECTING THEIR CELL

02:57:10.519 --> 02:57:12.388
PHONE TO THEIR INTERNET

02:57:12.455 --> 02:57:14.290
PROVIDER IN UTILIZING THEIR

02:57:14.357 --> 02:57:15.825
INTERNET PROVIDER OR VOICE OVER

02:57:15.891 --> 02:57:18.728
INTERNET PROTOCOL PHONE SERVICE

02:57:18.794 --> 02:57:19.362
TO HAVE COMMUNICATION WITH THE

02:57:19.428 --> 02:57:21.397
OUTSIDE WORLD. ONCE THE POWER

02:57:21.464 --> 02:57:23.065
IS TURNED OFF THEY LOSE THE

02:57:23.132 --> 02:57:24.767
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND AS

02:57:24.834 --> 02:57:27.136
SUCH THEY LOSE THAT CELLPHONE

02:57:27.203 --> 02:57:28.571
AND THAT VOICE OR IN A PROTOCOL

02:57:28.637 --> 02:57:29.739
FONG AND AS YOU KNOW MANY

02:57:29.805 --> 02:57:30.973
PEOPLE ARE ARE STARTING TO GO

02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.375
AWAY FROM LANDLINE PHONES AND

02:57:32.441 --> 02:57:34.977
SO IN THOSE CASES- SOMETIMES

02:57:35.044 --> 02:57:36.612
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE LEFT.

02:57:36.679 --> 02:57:38.180
IS THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE

02:57:38.247 --> 02:57:40.216
THAT WRAPS YOU'RE ONE OF THE

02:57:40.282 --> 02:57:43.252
OTHER- MECHANISMS OFFERED BY I

02:57:43.319 --> 02:57:45.054
PAUSE THE MERCY ALERT SYSTEM WE

02:57:45.121 --> 02:57:46.889
HAVE SOME RADIO OUR SYSTEM AND

02:57:46.956 --> 02:57:50.126
SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. A

02:57:50.192 --> 02:57:57.600
STATE WIDE. PLAN AROUND-

02:57:57.666 --> 02:57:58.167
GETTING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

02:57:58.234 --> 02:58:00.503
THAT. THEY HAVE A- RESPONSE.

02:58:00.569 --> 02:58:01.771
THEY HAVE TO TAKE PERSONAL

02:58:01.837 --> 02:58:05.408
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEMSELVES

02:58:05.474 --> 02:58:07.343
FOR THEIR LOVED ONES FOR THEIR

02:58:07.410 --> 02:58:10.112
NEIGHBORS AS A GROUP BECAUSE IF

02:58:10.179 --> 02:58:11.847
THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE

02:58:11.914 --> 02:58:12.581
IF THEY DON'T TAKE THAT TAKE

02:58:12.648 --> 02:58:14.850
RESPONSIBILITY IF THEY'RE JUST

02:58:14.917 --> 02:58:15.951
WAITING FOR THEIR LOCAL

02:58:16.018 --> 02:58:17.520
GOVERNMENT TO TELL THEM WHEN

02:58:17.586 --> 02:58:19.422
AND WHERE AND WHAT TO DO AND

02:58:19.488 --> 02:58:20.656
THEN THEY'LL MAKE A DECISION AS

02:58:20.723 --> 02:58:22.324
TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING

02:58:22.391 --> 02:58:25.027
TO. LISTEN TO BE LOCAL

02:58:25.094 --> 02:58:28.330

02:58:38.874 --> 02:58:41.777
OVERWHELMING SUCCESS ACROSS THE

02:58:41.844 --> 02:58:44.613
BOARD IT TAKES THE PUBLIC TO BE

02:58:44.680 --> 02:58:46.682
PART OF THIS EQUATION AND NOT

02:58:46.749 --> 02:58:48.250
ONLY IN TERMS OF PREPAREDNESS

02:58:48.317 --> 02:58:50.252
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PREVENTION

02:58:50.319 --> 02:58:53.589
AND WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY

02:58:53.656 --> 02:58:54.890

MORE RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE

02:59:23.886 --> 02:59:25.654

REDUNDANCY I THINK THAT THIS IS

02:59:37.233 --> 02:59:39.435
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED

TO NARROW IT DOWN JUST TO A

03:00:21.710 --> 03:00:25.781
COUPLE- IN FOCUS ON. SOME OF

03:00:25.848 --> 03:00:27.316
THE LEGISLATION THAT I'VE DONE

WE'VE REALLY CREATED A GOOD

03:00:45.668 --> 03:00:48.304
SYSTEM- I WON'T BE HERE TO

03:00:48.370 --> 03:00:50.239
IMPROVE UPON IT I'M SURE THERE

03:00:50.306 --> 03:00:52.074
IS A LOT TO IMPROVE UPON AND I

03:00:52.141 --> 03:00:53.542
WANT TO INVITE YOU ALL TO WORK

03:00:53.609 --> 03:00:56.779
WITH. MY COLLEAGUES WHO. SHARE

03:00:56.845 --> 03:00:59.682
THIS AREA OF CONCERN. IT WHEN

03:00:59.748 --> 03:01:02.251
AND IF YOU IDENTIFY PLACES

03:01:02.318 --> 03:01:04.553
WHERE MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO

03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:06.922
DO A BETTERJOB I DO A LOT OF

03:01:06.989 --> 03:01:08.123
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS SORT OF AN

03:01:08.190 --> 03:01:09.992
INITIAL START WHEN IT COMES TO

03:01:10.059 --> 03:01:13.062
WILDFIRES- BUT- I'M- I'M ALSO

03:01:13.128 --> 03:01:14.496
CONCERNED THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

03:01:14.563 --> 03:01:16.131
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE AN OPT IN AND

03:01:16.198 --> 03:01:18.500
OPT OUT WE SHOULD JUST DO IT-

03:01:18.567 --> 03:01:22.104
AND- NOT THAT I DISAGREE- BUT-

03:01:22.171 --> 03:01:23.672
I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE TO BE

03:01:23.739 --> 03:01:24.840
REALISTIC THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

03:01:24.907 --> 03:01:25.908
THAT JUST DON'T. WANT US

03:01:25.975 --> 03:01:28.344
TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO. AND

03:01:28.410 --> 03:01:29.011
THEY'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE NO

03:01:29.078 --> 03:01:31.847
MATTER WHAT WE TELL THEM- AND

03:01:31.914 --> 03:01:34.750
THAT'S JUST A FACT- BUT I DO DO

03:01:34.817 --> 03:01:37.353
LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES OR I

03:01:37.419 --> 03:01:38.587
SHOULD SAY THAT ENCOURAGED

03:01:38.654 --> 03:01:41.056
RISKY UNIVERSITIES. TO CREATE

03:01:41.123 --> 03:01:43.525
AN OPT OUT SYSTEM. THAT MEANS

03:01:43.592 --> 03:01:48.731
THAT MOST PEOPLE. WILL BE IN

03:01:48.797 --> 03:01:49.732
THE SYSTEM DOWN GET NOTIFIED.

03:01:49.798 --> 03:01:50.933
THEY'LL BE. AND HOW. THEY'LL

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.168
MAKE. THE BEST DECISION FOR

03:01:53.235 --> 03:01:54.870
THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. BUT MY

03:01:54.937 --> 03:01:56.472
CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE NOT

03:01:56.538 --> 03:02:00.643
SEEING- COMMUNITIES A- COUNTIES

03:02:00.709 --> 03:02:03.512
REALLY. PROMOTING THIS PROCESS

03:02:03.579 --> 03:02:05.781
OF IT IS THAT WE LEFT IT UP TO

03:02:05.848 --> 03:02:07.049
EVERY COUNTY BECAUSE WE

03:02:07.116 --> 03:02:09.551
RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THERE IS A

03:02:09.618 --> 03:02:12.054
LOT WE CAN DO STATEWIDE IMPACT

03:02:12.121 --> 03:02:13.789
PROBABLY SHOULD BE DOING MORE.

03:02:13.856 --> 03:02:15.924
OUT WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE

03:02:15.991 --> 03:02:18.227
EVERY COUNTY HAS ITS DIFFERENT-

03:02:18.294 --> 03:02:20.596
ISSUES CONCERNS GEOGRAPHY

03:02:20.663 --> 03:02:22.564
EXPERIENCE WHATEVER. AND THAT

03:02:22.631 --> 03:02:24.500
THERE NEEDS TO BE IN PORT AS

03:02:24.566 --> 03:02:26.135
WELL FROM FROM THOSE AREAS

03:02:26.201 --> 03:02:28.237
SKINNER WE HAVE DIFFERENT-

03:02:28.304 --> 03:02:30.406
FIRED WE HAVE FOUR SHOP IN THE

03:02:30.472 --> 03:02:32.741
NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE- WE

03:02:32.808 --> 03:02:36.078
HAVE DIFFERENT- YOU KNOW. TYPES

03:02:36.145 --> 03:02:38.047
OF FUELS IN THE SOUTHERN PART

03:02:38.113 --> 03:02:39.214
OF THE STATE AND I HAVE TO

03:02:39.281 --> 03:02:40.382
ADDRESS THEM DIFFERENTLY THERE

03:02:40.449 --> 03:02:42.651
IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL. BUT I

03:02:42.718 --> 03:02:43.752
WOULD LIKE YOU TO SHARE WITH

GETTING GREATER PARTICIPATION

03:02:49.458 --> 03:02:51.527
IN OUR OPT OUT NOTIFICATION

03:02:51.593 --> 03:02:54.496

03:02:59.535 --> 03:03:00.502
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

03:03:00.569 --> 03:03:02.504
MECHANISMS- SOMEBODY HAD

03:03:02.571 --> 03:03:03.806
MENTIONED LIKE WE HAD THE OLD

03:03:03.872 --> 03:03:05.307
CONRAD SYSTEM FOR ANY OF YOU

03:03:05.374 --> 03:03:07.843
OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER- THAT

03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:09.478
CRISIS BACK WHEN WE THOUGHT WE

03:03:09.545 --> 03:03:10.913
WERE GOING TO BE IN A NUCLEAR.

03:03:10.979 --> 03:03:13.082
GOD HELP US- THE NUCLEAR

03:03:13.148 --> 03:03:14.883
DISASTER WE HAD THIS WARNING

03:03:14.950 --> 03:03:15.851
SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE IT

03:03:15.918 --> 03:03:18.020
ANYMORE- WE USED TO BACK IN THE

03:03:18.087 --> 03:03:19.521
OLD DAYS HAVE THECHURCH BELLS

03:03:19.588 --> 03:03:21.056
WE DON'T HAVE THOSE EITHER. SO

03:03:21.123 --> 03:03:22.658
BUT WE DO HAVE TECHNOLOGY WE

03:03:22.725 --> 03:03:23.659
HAVE SOME EXTRAORDINARY

03:03:23.726 --> 03:03:28.931
POSSIBILITIES WHY ARE WE NOT.

03:03:28.997 --> 03:03:34.937
SEEING IT BEING USED MORE.

03:03:35.003 --> 03:03:38.040
THANK YOU. BRING RACE. JUST I

03:03:38.107 --> 03:03:41.543

IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY- I'M GOING

03:03:44.646 --> 03:03:46.348
BACK IN MY MEMORY YOU CAN EVEN

03:03:46.415 --> 03:03:49.251
TRYING TO REMEMBER- THE LAST

03:03:49.318 --> 03:03:51.754
TIME THE COUNTY MAY HAVE PUT A

03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:53.522
NOTICE ON TWITTER IS THAT YOU

03:03:53.589 --> 03:03:55.724
SEE ON TELEVISION OR RADIO ON

03:03:55.791 --> 03:03:58.193
SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT THE SYSTEM

03:03:58.260 --> 03:04:01.363
AND- JOINING IN I THINK I THINK

03:04:01.430 --> 03:04:04.199
PART OF IT IS SAFE ANY THINK WE

03:04:04.266 --> 03:04:06.301
DO IF WHAT IS AFTER

03:04:06.368 --> 03:04:08.237
COMMUNICATION WE'RE PROBABLY

03:04:08.303 --> 03:04:09.738
GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE

03:04:09.805 --> 03:04:11.473
ENTIRE EVENT AND IF WE DON'T

03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:13.475
YEAH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THAT

03:04:13.542 --> 03:04:16.211
WOULD BE KIND OF ONE OF MY- MY

03:04:16.278 --> 03:04:17.546
BIGGEST ONE I DON'T THINK A LOT

03:04:17.613 --> 03:04:18.914
OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTIES ARE

03:04:18.981 --> 03:04:22.484
REALLY AWARE AND IT'S PROBABLY-

03:04:22.551 --> 03:04:25.020
AS- AS A- A COUNTY RESIDENT WE

03:04:25.087 --> 03:04:27.055
COULD PROBABLY DO BETTER. FOR

03:04:27.122 --> 03:04:29.191
AT LEAST MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE A

03:04:29.258 --> 03:04:32.227
YEAR TO RENEW THAT WITH THE

03:04:32.294 --> 03:04:33.962
RESIDENTS THAT HEY THIS IS

03:04:34.029 --> 03:04:35.097
SOMETHING WE NEED TO PAY

03:04:35.164 --> 03:04:39.168
ATTENTION. TO LIVE IN COUPLES

03:04:39.234 --> 03:04:42.371
YEAH. I COULD NOT DO THAT COM

03:04:42.438 --> 03:04:46.308
SO. WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE

03:04:46.375 --> 03:04:48.277
ACCOUNTING HAS. IT REALLY BEGAN

03:04:48.343 --> 03:04:51.146
YOUR BILL DANCE INSTEAD WHEN WE-

03:04:51.213 --> 03:04:53.115
ADOPTED THE USE OF A MERCY

03:04:53.182 --> 03:04:55.184
MASTERPIECES CALLED COBRA THERE

03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:56.452
OTHER VENDORS OUT THERE I'M NOT

03:04:56.518 --> 03:04:57.519
AND I'M NOT SAYING ONE IS

03:04:57.586 --> 03:04:58.987
BETTER THE OTHER BUT THAT'S

03:04:59.054 --> 03:05:00.122
WHAT WE WILL. BE COUNTY AND IN

03:05:00.189 --> 03:05:02.324
THAT REGARD OTHER FEATURES OF

03:05:02.391 --> 03:05:04.026
IT THAT ARE OFTEN. IF WE

03:05:04.092 --> 03:05:05.360
UTILIZE THE I BECAUSE OF COURSE

03:05:05.427 --> 03:05:06.161
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:07.596
THAT WE CAN DO THAT BUT WE'RE

03:05:07.663 --> 03:05:10.532
LIMITED TERMS DROP. LIKE WHAT

03:05:10.599 --> 03:05:14.236
WE FOUND IS YOU AFTER. ON THE-

03:05:14.303 --> 03:05:15.571
TRYING TO GET THE WORD OUT

03:05:15.637 --> 03:05:17.973
THROUGH VARIOUS MECHANISMS

03:05:18.040 --> 03:05:22.010
SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS ARE.

03:05:22.077 --> 03:05:23.846
GOING ON LOCAL NEWS STATIONS

03:05:23.912 --> 03:05:27.382
TALKING THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ON.

03:05:27.449 --> 03:05:30.719
THE PEOPLE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES

03:05:30.786 --> 03:05:34.056
JUST DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT.

03:05:34.122 --> 03:05:34.690
DID YOU CRISIS THEY DON'T LIKE

03:05:34.756 --> 03:05:36.225
TO THINK ABOUT A POTENTIAL

03:05:36.291 --> 03:05:39.127
CATASTROPHE AND SO OUR EFFORT

03:05:39.194 --> 03:05:39.661
TO GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP

03:05:39.728 --> 03:05:42.097
DESPITE OUR PUBLIC RELATIONS

03:05:42.164 --> 03:05:46.802
CAMPAIGN. WAS MOM- MEDIOCRE AT

03:05:46.869 --> 03:05:50.072
BEST UNTIL. A CRISIS HAPPENS

03:05:50.138 --> 03:05:52.407
AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT. IN

03:05:52.474 --> 03:05:54.643
THE- WHEN THE FIRE IS BEARING

03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:56.445
DOWN UPON PEOPLE WHEN THE WHEN

03:05:56.512 --> 03:05:57.379
THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR THE

03:05:57.446 --> 03:05:58.981
DAM BEEN EVERYBODY STARTS

03:05:59.047 --> 03:06:00.048
PAYING ATTENTION AND THAT'S

03:06:00.115 --> 03:06:03.118
WHEN WE HAD SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS

03:06:03.185 --> 03:06:05.254
OF PEOPLE ULTIMATELY SIGNED UP.

03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:08.257
THERE HAD TO BE THAT REP MOONEY

03:06:08.323 --> 03:06:10.759
FOR THEM TO BE MOTIVATED ENOUGH

03:06:10.826 --> 03:06:12.961
TO GO ON AND SIGN UP FOR THE

03:06:13.028 --> 03:06:14.863
ALERTS. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER

03:06:14.930 --> 03:06:16.665
REASON WE ALTERNATELY REALIZE

03:06:16.732 --> 03:06:17.366
WE HAD A MESSAGE ACROSS

03:06:17.432 --> 03:06:18.834
MULTIPLE PLATFORMS IS A BIT

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:20.903
ALSO REFER CODE RED PERHAPS WE

03:06:20.969 --> 03:06:23.639
CAN GET HIM THROUGH FACEBOOK

03:06:23.705 --> 03:06:27.142
TWITTER SIGN. INFORMATION

03:06:27.209 --> 03:06:28.644
CENTER OF THAT'S I DO THE LEDGE.

03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:30.512
I DID THE CREATES AN OP OUT SO

03:06:30.579 --> 03:06:32.781
THAT EVERYBODY GETS PUT IN THE

03:06:32.848 --> 03:06:34.950
SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY YOU DON'T

03:06:35.017 --> 03:06:37.586
HAVE TO GET THEIR PERMISSION-

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:39.054
BUT THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT IF

03:06:39.121 --> 03:06:40.422
THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE

03:06:40.489 --> 03:06:42.357
THEY CAN OPT OUT- YOU KNOW THIS

03:06:42.424 --> 03:06:45.227
IS THE WAY THAT- ALL OF THE-

03:06:45.294 --> 03:06:46.995
PLATFORMS ON THE INTERNET.

03:06:47.062 --> 03:06:49.031
YOU'RE IN THE SYSTEM UNLESS YOU%

03:06:49.097 --> 03:06:51.166
SAY NO I DON'T WANT TO BE- I

03:06:51.233 --> 03:06:52.534
THOUGHT THAT HEY WE'VE GOT A

03:06:52.601 --> 03:06:54.269
PROCESS HERE WHERE WE CAN KEEP

03:06:54.336 --> 03:06:56.538
PEOPLE SAFE. I CREATING AN OPT

03:06:56.605 --> 03:06:58.173
OUT SYSTEM BUT I BELIEVE I

03:06:58.240 --> 03:06:59.675
HEARD THAT ONLY TWENTY EIGHT

03:06:59.741 --> 03:07:01.510
COUNTIES ARE REALLY ACTIVELY

03:07:01.577 --> 03:07:03.879
INVOLVED IN THAT- AND I'M JUST

03:07:03.946 --> 03:07:05.113
WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET IS A

03:07:05.180 --> 03:07:07.416
SENSE OF WHY WE ARE HAVING SUCH

03:07:07.482 --> 03:07:10.252
DIFFICULTY WITH THIS OPT OUT

03:07:10.319 --> 03:07:11.587
PROGRAM WHERE. LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:07:11.653 --> 03:07:14.289
CAN AND IS ABLE TO REACH OUT TO

03:07:14.356 --> 03:07:16.858
VARIOUS- PROVIDERS TO GET THE

03:07:16.925 --> 03:07:18.360
INFORMATION PUT IT IN THEIR

03:07:18.427 --> 03:07:19.995
SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN THERE IS AN

03:07:20.062 --> 03:07:22.130
EMERGENCY. THAT GOES OUT TO THE

03:07:22.197 --> 03:07:24.399
COMMUNITY- THEY THEY HAVEN'T

03:07:24.466 --> 03:07:26.234
OPTED IN THEY HAVEN'T HAD TO

03:07:26.301 --> 03:07:27.102
OFTEN THEY HAVE AN AT THE THINK

03:07:27.169 --> 03:07:29.471
ABOUT IT. IT'S THERE THAT'S THE

03:07:29.538 --> 03:07:30.939
REASON WE TRIED AN OPT OUT AND

03:07:31.006 --> 03:07:32.040
YET I'M CONCERNED THAT IT

03:07:32.107 --> 03:07:34.176
DOESN'T SEEM. TO BE HAVING THE

03:07:34.242 --> 03:07:35.344
EFFECT THAT WE WERE HOPING

03:07:35.410 --> 03:07:36.678
WHICH IS THAT EVERYONE WE GET

03:07:36.745 --> 03:07:38.280
NOTIFIED BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS

03:07:38.347 --> 03:07:42.517
AN EMERGENCY. THAT'S WHAT

03:07:42.584 --> 03:07:43.151
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. I

03:07:43.218 --> 03:07:44.286
UNDERSTAND A NUMBER GONNA BRING

03:07:44.353 --> 03:07:45.320
YOU IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION

03:07:45.387 --> 03:07:46.555
ALSO MADE I THINK WAS THAT

03:07:46.622 --> 03:07:47.723
THAT'S A GOOD APPROACH NOW.

03:07:47.789 --> 03:07:49.825
RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERY COUNTY

03:07:49.891 --> 03:07:52.294
NOT EVERY COUNTY. HAS THE SAME

03:07:52.361 --> 03:07:55.230
RESOURCES AND CAPACITY TO.

03:07:55.297 --> 03:07:56.765
BRING SYSTEMS ON SO THAT MIGHT

03:07:56.832 --> 03:07:58.834
ACCOUNT FOR. WHY THERE'S BEEN A

03:07:58.900 --> 03:08:01.336
LACK ULTIMATELY NOT BUT IT ALSO

03:08:01.403 --> 03:08:03.238
BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER POINT

03:08:03.305 --> 03:08:03.739
WHICH I THINK IS REALLY

03:08:03.805 --> 03:08:05.674
IMPORTANT IS. THERE IS AN OVER

03:08:05.741 --> 03:08:07.976
RELIANCE UPON TECHNOLOGY

03:08:08.043 --> 03:08:12.948
ESPECIALLY CELL PHONES. AND IF

03:08:13.015 --> 03:08:14.383
THE MAJORITY OF OUR EFFORTS TO

03:08:14.449 --> 03:08:15.617
COMMUNICATE THROUGH A CELL

SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND

03:26:08.756 --> 03:26:09.924
SEVENTEEN CINEMA COUNTY WAS

03:26:37.518 --> 03:26:38.452
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

03:26:38.519 --> 03:26:40.855
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWENTY

03:26:40.921 --> 03:26:41.455
SEVENTEEN WERE AFTERWARDS WE

03:26:41.522 --> 03:26:43.157

MEYERS FIRE ON ONE SIDE. AND

03:26:55.569 --> 03:26:57.438
THE GLASS FAR ON THE OTHER. IS

03:26:57.505 --> 03:27:00.274
SUSTAINED AND SIGNIFICANT-

FROM CLIMATIC. SITUATION

03:27:04.578 --> 03:27:08.249
CHANGING. SO I WILL NOT GO INTO

03:27:08.315 --> 03:27:10.284
THE DEEPER LEVELS OF RESILIENCE

03:27:10.351 --> 03:27:11.552

BREAKS AND OTHER THINGS OF THE

03:27:27.735 --> 03:27:29.837
OF THE LIKE. BUT WHAT I DO WANT

03:27:29.904 --> 03:27:30.738
TO TALK ABOUT IS THE DIFFERENCE

03:27:30.805 --> 03:27:35.643
BETWEEN. WHAT I CALL THE TABLE

03:27:35.709 --> 03:27:37.077

COVERT THE SITUATION WE HAD A

03:28:41.208 --> 03:28:42.943
SPIKE IN OUR CODE NUMBERS. A

03:28:43.010 --> 03:28:45.079
POST OUR VALUATIONS BUT THERE'S

03:28:45.145 --> 03:28:47.081
OBVIOUSLY A HUGE IMPACT OF

03:28:47.147 --> 03:28:49.250
EVACUATING 4260% OF YOUR

03:28:49.316 --> 03:28:51.418

ALERT WARNING SYSTEM-

03:29:44.772 --> 03:29:46.073
EFFECTIVELY CHANGING WHAT I

03:29:46.140 --> 03:29:47.541
WOULD CALL THE BLACK AISLADOS

03:29:47.608 --> 03:29:49.176
IS THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT. OF

EVACUATIONS ARE NOT BEING

03:29:52.846 --> 03:29:54.715
TRAINED AND EVEN PREPARE TO USE

03:29:54.782 --> 03:29:56.784
THOSE SYSTEMS. TO NOW BEING THE

03:29:56.850 --> 03:29:58.152
POINT OF THE SPEAR IN TERMS OF

03:29:58.218 --> 03:29:59.787
FIGURING IT OUT THIS IS ONE

03:29:59.853 --> 03:30:01.455
THING I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR

03:30:01.522 --> 03:30:02.456
THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS TO

03:30:02.523 --> 03:30:04.858
LOOK AT. IS AND NOT JUST THE

03:30:04.925 --> 03:30:07.127
IDEA THAT PEOPLE LOCALS HAVE TO

03:30:07.194 --> 03:30:08.862
HAVE LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION

03:30:08.929 --> 03:30:11.332

FROM ONE THING I THINK YOU GUYS

03:30:42.162 --> 03:30:44.531
SHOULD CONSIDER FROM A NINE ONE

03:30:44.598 --> 03:30:46.300
ONE SYSTEM- WHICH CAN NOT

03:30:46.367 --> 03:30:47.901
HANDLE ALL OF THE PHONE CALLS

03:30:47.968 --> 03:30:49.703
FROM PEOPLE BEING EVACUATED.

03:30:49.770 --> 03:30:52.172
INTO THAT MUCH MORE OF THE

03:30:52.239 --> 03:30:52.906
DEVELOPMENT OF SOMETHING FROM

03:30:52.973 --> 03:30:55.342
SAN DIEGO IN ANOTHER SYSTEM RUN

03:30:55.409 --> 03:30:56.710
OUT OF ENSURE A WHICH IS TWO

03:30:56.777 --> 03:30:58.112

WHEN WE TALK YOU. IS THAT YOU

03:31:07.988 --> 03:31:09.690

CELLPHONE. I ALSO FULLY SUPPORT

03:32:28.535 --> 03:32:30.838
OPT OUT PROGRAMS BECAUSE-

03:32:30.904 --> 03:32:32.072
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SAYING THAT

03:32:32.139 --> 03:32:34.241
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH- BUT YET
