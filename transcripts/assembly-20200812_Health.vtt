00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:22.740
IT WE DID HOLD IT AS A AS A

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:24.976
POLICY ISSUE. IS STILL ONE I

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:26.311
THINK HAS PARTICULAR RESONANCE

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:29.013
GIVEN. A KOBE. SO WE COME TO

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.348
JERRY MEDICATIONS ACTUALLY TWO

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:31.683
ISSUES ONE IS OF COURSE THE

00:32:31.749 --> 00:32:33.618
COST ISSUE. THE OTHER ISSUES

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:35.920
ALSO- READY SUPPLY AS WELL SO

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:37.555
WE KNOW THE GENERIC SPACE EVEN

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:39.090
WITHOUT CREE COVE IT. THERE ARE

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:40.758
CERTAIN GENERIC MEDICATIONS AND

00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:42.160
WHICH WE COULDN'T GET RELIABLE

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.828
SUPPLY. WE ALSO KNOW DOOR OTHER

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.129
GENERIC MEDICATIONS WOULD OR

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:45.797
MIGHT BE JUST A SINGLE

00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:47.865
MANUFACTURE AND IN FACT PERHAPS

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:49.467
AN INVESTOR WOULD COME AND- BY

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:51.703
THAT SINGLE MANUFACTURE AND

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.237
THEN RAISE ITS PRICES AWAY TO.

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:55.073
MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS. AND

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:57.475
CAUSING PRICE SPIKES. AND THEN

00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:58.409
OF COURSE WE ALSO KNOW THERE'S

00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:01.012
OTHER GENERICS IN WHICH- THERE

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:02.914
IS OPPORTUNITY FOR- WHERE

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.048
BASICALLY THE PRICE JUST KEEPS

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:05.717
RISING AND THERE'S A NARROW

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.051
NUMBER OF MANUFACTURE SO BY.

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:09.387
INCLUDING A- THE STATE IS

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:11.656
ESSENTIALLY A- EITHER A DIRECT

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:13.391
MANUFACTURER OR A CONTRACT TO

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:15.293
MANUFACTURE. THAT WOULD HELP

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.994
BUILD STABILIZE PRICE AND

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.629
SUPPLY IN ITS ACT ACTUALLY ON

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:20.998
THE PRIVATE SECTOR- THERE'S AN

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.834
OLD CALLED CIVIC OF COMPOSED OF

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.402
HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS THAT

00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:26.037
IS TRYING TO. DO JUST THAT AND

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:26.604
CERTAINLY WE'VE BEEN

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.639
ACCOMPLISHED. WITH CIVICA AS

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:30.308
WELL WITHOUT BEING SURE THAT WE

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:32.744
CAN WE HAVE A RELIABLE AND- LOW

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:39.117
COST. GENERIC MEDICATION SINCE.

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:40.385
ARE WE WORKING WITH GOVERNORS.

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:41.219
WELL DEVELOPING THIS BUT LIKE

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:43.287
JUST I WOULD KNOW DURING WE ARE

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:44.288
FOR CHEN. WITH SUPPLIED.

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:47.325
WHETHER IT'S TESTING PP AND

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.360
EVEN MEDICATION BY THE WAY SO-

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:51.729
UNFORTUNATELY WE- HAVE NOT SEEN

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:53.431
THE SHORTAGES THAT SOME OF THE

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:54.532
OTHER STATES HAVE SEEN THAT

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:55.600
WORD HOSPITALS WOULD OVERWHELM

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:57.135
THE WORD NOT ONLY FOR THE SHORT

00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.036
PP. YOUR SHORT OF THE VERY

00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:00.772
MEDICATIONS PEOPLE NEED TO GET

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:01.506
TREATED FOR OUR TO BE

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:03.841
INNOVATIVE FOR. A COVETED. AND

00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:05.009
SO THIS IS GONNA BE A VERY

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:07.378
IMPORTANT STEP TO CONTINUE TO

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:10.047
MOVE FORWARD. TO LOOK AT BOTH

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:13.518
HOW DO WE ASSURE A STABLE. AND

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:15.086
THE LOW COST COST EFFECTIVE

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:16.888
SUPPLY OF GENERIC MEDICATION.

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:18.756
AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WE ALSO

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.291
HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN SUPPLY

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:21.759
CHAIN NECESSARY TO MEET THE

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:26.464
NEEDS OF DURING. CRISIS. LIKE

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:27.865
OCTOBER NINETEEN. YOU KNOW I

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:30.768
WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT WELL HIGH

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:32.370
TO CLERK WHEN HIS UNFORTUNATELY

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:33.938
NOT PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:35.139
TREATMENT FOR COVERED WHEN IT

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:36.441
WAS BEING CONSIDERED- WE

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:38.643
ACTUALLY HAD SHORTAGES NOT JUST

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:39.477
FOR PEOPLE TO COME OF IT BUT

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.245
DIRECTLY PEOPLE WHO DO NEED IT

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:43.347
FOR THAT'S EFFECTIVE TREATMENT

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:45.416
FOR LUPUS ARTHRITIS. AND SO-

00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:47.485
THIS BILL. CONTINUES TO MOVE

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:49.487
THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD GIVES

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:50.988
THE- MINISTRATION THE

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.557
OPPORTUNITYBUT ALSO ENSURES

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:53.991
THAT LEGISLATION INVOLVED IN

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:56.127
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS POLICY.

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:57.762
SO WE CAN AGAIN GET AHEAD OF

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:59.363

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:02.200

INCREASE IN PRICE MORE THAN

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:10.688

00:38:37.281 --> 00:38:38.716
MANUFACTURERS TO HAVE TO

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.584
