MULLIN. STEINORTH TING. VIGOROUS WYNONNA STEPS A QUORUM AS A MEMBER HOLDEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE PRESENT WHEN EVERYBODY. CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT'S A PLEASURE TO PRESENT IT AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY THREE TODAY THE BILL WILL CLARIFY THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST ROLE IN THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG STUDENTS. I'LL START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED. BY CO A. AND CM A TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK. WITH THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS AND I BELIEVE WE CAN COME TO. A UNDERSTANDING AND A COMPROMISE THAT REPRESENTS AND RESPECTS THE PROTECTIONS OF AB ONE THOUSAND. AND NO LONGER HINDER STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FROM GETTING THE HELP THEY RECEIVED. BEFORE THE LAW WAS ENACTED. I HAVE A CHILD HAS A DISABILITY THE FEDERAL IDA. ACT AND CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRE EDUCATORS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND PARENTS TO COME TOGETHER AND CREATE A PLAN THAT ENABLES THE CHILD TO GET THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE. THIS IS CALLED AN INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLAN OR IEP. THE IP CAN INCLUDE ANYTHING FROM WHERE STUDENT SHOULD SIT IN CLASS TO THE TYPE OF JUST THE NEED. TO HOW OFTEN THEY TAKE BREAKS. THEY CAN ALSO RECOMMEND VISITS BY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO ENSURE THEIR MOBILITY ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED AND NOT HINDRANCE. TO THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB ONE THOUSAND WHICH ALLOWS PATIENTS DIRECT ACCESS TO A PHYSICAL THERAPIST. FOR FORTY FIVE DAYS OR TWELVE VISITS BEFORE NEEDING A MEDICAL DOCTORS REFERRAL. THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE FOR PATIENTS OF PHYSICAL THERAPISTS. AND IT MEDICAL SETTING. HOWEVER IT I ACCIDENTALLY CREATED LIMITATIONS WHERE THERE WERE NONE OF US NONE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY THREE WILL RESTORE THE STUDENTS PHYSICAL THERAPISTS RELATIONSHIP. TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE AB ONE THOUSAND WAS ENACTED BY EXEMPTING STUDENTS THAT ARE DIRECTED TO SEE A PHYSICAL THERAPIST BY IEP. FROM THE FORTY FIVE DAY TO TWELVE VISIT RULE. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS CONCERNS YOU HAVE ABOUT THIS EXCEPTION. I HAVE WITH ME TO WITNESSES CARL LONDON REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ASSOCIATION AND DON JAMES. MY CONSTITUENTS AND A PHYSICAL THERAPIST THAT SERVES CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. LIKE TO HEAR FROM THEM AND THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR. THE GOVERNMENT PLEASE NEVER READ MISTER CHAIRMAN. CARL LONDON HERE MATH CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN DESCRIBED. WE AS MANY MADE NO AND SOME MAY NOT KNOW. FIVE YEARS AGO WE DID A BILL THAT PERTAIN TO TREATMENT OF PATIENTS BY PHYSICAL THERAPIST DIRECTLY. AS KIND OF A. SAFETY MEASURE COMPROMISE BETWEEN US IN THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WE PUT A TRIGGERING AN FOR A PATIENT TO WHO DOES HAVE SOME KIND OF A DREAM GHOST A PHYSICAL THERAPIST. TO CHECK BACK WITH THEIR OWN POSITION WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS OR TWELVE VISITS WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. NONE OF US CONTEMPLATED WHAT WAS HAPPENING FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS OR SO. IN THE EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT AND IN THE EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT AS PART OF A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS HAVE LONG BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES SCHOOL CHILDREN AND. IN EARLY INTERVENTION FOR KIDS ARE REFERRED AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR ZERO THREE AGE GROUP. THIS BILL SIMPLY EXEMPTS. THOSE SITUATIONS IN THE SCHOOL BASED ENVIRONMENT. WE LEFT OUT THE AYE OFFICE P. THE EARLY INTERVENTION PART TO SORT OF HAVE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE OPPONENTS TO THE BILL THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OTHERS. SO WE CAN TRY TO RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES THERE. BUT ESSENTIALLY THIS JUST RECOGNIZES WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE WE ACCIDENTALLY METAL IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND TAKES CARE THAT IN JUST A CRACK FOR THE RECORD WE DIDN'T TAKE THE ENTIRE AMENDMENT THAT THE OPPONENTS OFFERED. WE THERE'S ONE LAST SENTENCE AT A MEMBER THEY OFFERED THAT WE DID NOT TAKE BUT WE HAD AN AGREEMENT THAT WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THOSE. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY DON JEANS AS MR HOLDEN. SAID WHO IS A LONGTIME PRACTITIONER IN THIS FIELD IN SPACE. AND PROVIDE SERVICES EVERY TO CHILDREN IT EITHER IN SCHOOLS AS PART OF THE IEP PROCESS. OR IN EARLY INTERVENTION WITH CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME IT WOULD HAVE IT ADDITIONAL MINUTE HAVE TO THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING AND MANY MISSED ON JAMES I'M A PHYSICAL THERAPIST I HOLD A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN PHYSICAL THERAPY. AND I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE C. PEACHES GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. I'M ALSO. AT PEDIATRIC THERAPISTS ARE BURKE IN SCHOOLS AND IN EARLY INTERVENTION. SO. WHAT? WHAT AB TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY THREE WOULD DO IS TO HAVE ALLOW US TO TREAT A FEW CHILDREN WHO SHOW UP IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS A VERY MINIMAL NUMBER? WITHOUT AN OFFICIAL MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS ALL OF OUR CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE AN ELIGIBILITY THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY AN IEP TEAM HOWEVER AT TIMES. IT IS DONE BY THE ELIGIBLE HE'S BEEN DETERMINED BY AN IEP TEAM RATHER THAN A PHYSICIAN. AND IP TEAM IS MADE UP OF EDUCATORS INCLUDING SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST SPEECH THERAPIST OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST. PARENTS. AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS SO WE EVALUATE THE CHILDREN DETERMINE WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. SO THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR EDUCATION PROGRAM SO THAT'S WHEN THE PHYSICAL THERAPY SERVICES WOULD COME INTO PLAY. SO THESE ARE NOT CHILDREN. THE COVERED UNDER THIS PARTICULAR LANGUAGE THAT HAVE SEVERE MEDICAL. DISABILITIES THOSE CHILDREN OF RD BEEN IDENTIFIED AND ARE BEING FOLLOWED BY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR RICHARD JOINING US HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SITTING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF NOW ASK FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. OF PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE PODIUM. AND AGAIN WHAT LAW UP TO THREE MINUTES. PLEASE WHATEVER IT. A MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PRICE DOUGHERTY WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION. AT THE OUTSET NAM WHEN I THINK COMMITTEE STAFF AND OF THE AUTHOR. AND SPONSORS WORKING ON THIS ISSUE DILIGENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS EVEN OVER THE WEEKEND. WE ARE A. CARL'S CORRECT WE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED TODAY. ARE HALF A LOAF WE WERE. TALKING ABOUT NARROWING THE APPLICABILITY OF THE EXEMPTION BUT NUMBER TWO THE ONE THING THAT WERE PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO. IS THESE KIDS ARE. KIDS THAT DO NOT HAVE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS FROM A PHYSICIAN. THERE ARE ENOUGH WITH ME TODAY IS DOCTOR BASIL BASH PRESENT CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION WHO CAN SPEAK MORE INTELLIGENTLY ABOUT THIS THE NINE BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE KIDS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RENDERED A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS. WHO HAVE CONDITIONS THAT MAKES THEM ELIGIBLE FOR THE I EP THAT COULD BE DELAYED ONSET UNDERPAID MEDICAL UNDERPINNING ISSUES? AND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR AT SOME POINT DURING THAT I EP PROCESS. VERBALLY BEFORE THE LIMITATION ON THE P. T. VISITS OR TIME FOR TREATMENT EXPIRES. THAT THAT WERE ENSURE THAT THE I EP OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WORKING ON THAT IEP MAKE SURE THAT THAT KID IS EVALUATED BY A PHYSICIAN. AND THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOW SOME OF THESE KIDS COME TO PHYSICAL THERAPIST BY REFERRAL FROM A PEDIATRICIAN. THERE MAY BE PHYSICIANS INVOLVED IN THE TREATMENT PLAN EVEN THOUGH MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS HAS IT BEEN RENDERED BUT THE LAST RUBICON THAT WE WANNA CROSSES THESE KIDS ARE. ARE COMPROMISED AND THEY'RE IN A IN A IN A PROGRAM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAM INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ACT THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY HEALTHY KIDS BUT THEY ALSO ARE KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE A CHRONIC CONDITION THAT RENDERS A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS. AND SO AT SOME POINT WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE PHYSICIAN AND IS INVOLVED IF NOTHING ELSE PROVIDE THAT WITHOUT DIAGNOSIS. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN OF THE WRIST THE TIME TO DOCTOR BASH. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE CMMITTEE MY NAME IS BASIL BASHAM CURRENTLY PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO JUST GIPSON CLINICAL BACKGROUND ON THIS OKAY TYPICALLY THERAPISTS WILL TREAT PATIENTS WHO HAVE A PHYSICIAN PRESCRIPTION AND A DIAGNOSIS IS PRETTY REASONABLE SECOND TO A PHARMACIST. NOT DISPENSING MEDICATIONS WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION. WE REALIZE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME EXEMPTIONS AND THEY SHOULD BE NARROW. IN THIS CASE WHEN. ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE WITH THE THERAPIST REST OPEN MINDEDLY WHAT IS THE PROBLEM AND THEY POINTED OUT TO US THAT SOMETIMES. THESE KIDS COME UP TO THE AND OF THE FORTY FIVE DAY LIMIT AND THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO POSITION. AND WE OFFER TO HELP SOLVE THAT PROBLEM CREATING NETWORKS OF FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN GET PHYSICIAN INVOLVEMENT IN TO THE IP PROGRAM. BUT THE CURRENT LAST HURDLE IS THE AMENDMENT TO HAVE A REFERRAL TO A PHYSICIAN WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS. OF INITIATING A PHYSICAL THERAPY PROTOCOL IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE LET ME TELL YOU WHY CLINICALLY. LET THESE PATIENTS WILL GET INTO THIS IP PROGRAM FOR SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TRIVIAL LIKE A SYMPTOM A LACK OF COORDINATION PERHAPS. INABILITY TO USE A PENCIL ABSOLUTELY THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME THERAPY BUT ALSO CAN BE A TRIGGER SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS. OKAY THINGS LIKE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY CEREBRAL PALSY A BRAIN TUMOR. WE WENT FROM HOW CAN WE HELP YOU SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM OF GETTING THESE KIDS INTO PHYSICIAN TO PROPOSING THIS AMENDMENT AND HEARING NO. WE DON'T WANT THEM TO SEE THAT PHYSICIAN. THE AMENDMENT TO SIMPLE IT IS SEVERAL WORDS ALL IT SAYS IS IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THERAPY IS PART OF THE IEP PROGRAM. INVOLVE A PHYSICIAN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL THE TRIGGER ON A REFERRAL. JUST A REFERRAL NOTHING MORE TO SAY THAT THE PHYSICIAN SHOULDN'T BE PART OF THE TREATMENT TEAM AT ALL. DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE WE'RE GONNA HURT SOME KIDS IN THIS IS A VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION. THIS IS A POPULATION WHERE YOU SEE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG IT'S UP ABOUT YES SIR. AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE SERIOUS DIAGNOSES WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE TEAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL MY IN INFLATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. I GOT MORE NUMBER ONE I WANT THOMAS REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WANNA THINK THE AUTHOR FOR. TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IN. LETTER THAT WELL WE WROTE TO THE COMMITTEE. BOB THAT THIS POINT ABOUT CMA WOULD THE SINCE HE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS WOULD REMOVE ITS OPPOSITION HOWEVER. OVER THE WEEKEND SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS ARE AROSE. WE WOULD LIKE TO REMAIN OUT AT THE TABLE AS STAKEHOLDERS I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BY THE WORTH OF PIZZA THAT. CAN. I WAS SO EASILY BE FIXED I THINK IT'S VERY CLOSE TO BEING FIX AND ALSO. WE MOVE OUR OPPOSITION BUT. WILL WILL I KEEP AN EYE ON THE BILL. COULD YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES QUESTIONS BEGIN OPPOSITION. SEEM NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM KUNO MEMBERS AT THIS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER SOME INCREASING THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND ALL THE PARTIES-YOU'RE TRYING TO. PROVIDE THE CARE NEEDED FOR KIDS AND. I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS PROBABLY IN A YEARS LONG CONVERSATIONS I APPRECIATE THAT. COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR. PROPONENTS AND ALSO FOR THEM ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON SO. THE DOCTORS HE MENTIONED. SO REVIEW HERE YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPIST THANK YOU AND MAKES THIS IS JUST A FEW KIDS. THAT MOST HAVE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. HOW MANY IS A FEW? BUT WHAT'S YOUR BASIS FOR SAYING THAT IF YOU ARE WHAT WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WE CAN WOULD GIVE YOUR BEST ESTIMATE ANY BASIS FOR. I WOULD SAY IN IN MY ESTIMATION. SOME MY EXPERIENCE SAY MAYBE ABOUT THREE PERCENT OF THE KIDS THAT I EVALUATED. DURING THE YEAR DON'T HAVE A ONE OF THEM AND. DE EVERY PAPER BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE EVEN GREET YOU AT WHAT POINT WOULD THAT CHILD. BE REFERRED TO A DOCTOR IF EVERYTHING WENT YOUR WAY. BASED ON OUR PRACTICE ACT WHENEVER A PHYSICAL THERAPIST DETERMINES THAT A CHILD HAS NEEDS OUTSIDE OF OUR SCOPE. WE'RE REQUIRED TO REFER THEM ALREADY. SO DID THE AMENDMENT THAT THEY'RE DISCUSSING IS THIS KIND OF A MOOT POINT AUTHORITY WITHIN OUR PRACTICE. THAT'S A REQUIREMENT. THEY WANT TO PUT A TIMEFRAME ON IT. ON WERE REQUIRED TO DO THAT ALREADY. OKAY AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM AT ALL THE TIME FOR YEAH SO I COULD BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THOSE FEW KIDS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEE. AND THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. AND THIS IS DEFINITE MY OF EXPERTISE BUT TO LOOK AT WHAT. IS THE BROADER MEDICAL CONDITION THAT MIGHT BE DEALT WITH SO I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE THE. PLANT OPPOSITION AND CHAMPS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT. WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT THEM TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT WERE FOR ALL OUT WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING CARE? THAT THE CONCERNED WITH WITH PUTTING THAT REFERRAL LANGUAGE. INTO THE IEP PROCESS IS ACTUALLY IF. A FINANCIAL ISSUE WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IF WE REQUIRE A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MAKE A REFERRAL AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS FINANCIALLY. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS TO PAY FOR THAT EVALUATION. BASED ON THE WAY THAT THE FEDERAL LANGUAGES IS. BOARDED AT THE MOMENT SO IS A PHYSICAL THERAPIST I HAVE TO. I HAVE TO REFER AT THE MOMENT. AND JUST NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT LANGUAGE WOULD LOOK. AT THIS POINT SO THAT'S IF THE LANGUAGE WOULD IT BE THAT YOU'RE GONNA THAT THE SCHOOLS THE ONE THAT'S REQUIRED TO DO YET THE REFERRAL. DO YOU HAPPEN LET'S SAY IF IT'S NOT TO SCHOOL BUT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LANGUAGE THAT WOULD SAY WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REFERRAL TO A DOCTOR. THIS I JUST BROUGHT HIM AND IF I IF I MADE THE ISSUE FOR US IS. LOOKING BACK OF THIS FOR AS I MENTION FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS. PHYSICAL THERAPISTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THE SERVICE WITH NO REQUIREMENTS OF ANY KIND. FIVE YEARS AGO WE GET THE DIRECT. ACCESS LAW THAT ALLOWS PATIENTS WHO HAVE THE INJURY OF SOME TYPE TO GO SEE A PHYSICAL THERAPIST RACKLEY. AND IN THAT WE'RE ALL CONTEMPLATING. SPRAINS SPORT MUSCLES ANKLES THERE'S YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT HAPPENS PEOPLE WE CAN LAWYER TYPE OR OTHERWISE. HE'D BE ABLE TO GO SEE A PHYSICAL THERAPIST FOR FORTY FIVE DAYS OR TWELVE VISITS. WHEN WE WROTE THAT IN NONE OF US WERE CONTEMPLATING WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOLS FOR OVER THREE DECADES. SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS BILLS TRIED TO EXEMPT OUT AND GET THAT SERVICE RIGHT BACK TO WHERE IT WAS PART US MESSING AROUND. WITH THE OTHER ISSUE AND SO THERE'S NOTHING IN. THAT REALM TODAY WITH HIS EXISTENCE THE PAST THIRTY FIVE OR SO YEARS. WERE ANY PROBLEMS OF EVER COME UP. AND PATIENTS ARE STUDENTS ARE PURPLE THERE FOR WHEN THEY NEED TO BE. BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT IN THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE STATE LAWS RELATING TO. SCHOOL BASED SERVICES RELATED TO LEARNING. WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO AS A HOLD UP IN THE SERVICES THE KIDS RECEIVE THAT HEALTH SOME ACCESS THOSE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS FULLY? AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. SO YOU KNOW WHAT WERE I THINK UNDER DISCUSSION IS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HOLD UP SERVICES. BUT STILL HEDGES AGAINST WHATEVER THESE NEW ISSUES ARE THAT MIGHT COME UP THAT I'VE NEVER COME UP BEFORE. BUT MAY COME UP AND. THAT'S REALLY WHAT WORDS OR HASHING OVER WE'VE DONE MOST OF IT TO CONTEMPLATE THIS AND. THERE'S NOT ANY EFFORT HERE TO SKIRT KIDS NOT BEING SEEN A PURPLE IN FACT. MANY KIDS WENT UP IN THE SCHOOL BE SYSTEM OR IN THEIR EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEM COME DIRECTLY FROM. PHYSICIAN REFERRALS ANYWAY WITHOUT A DIAGNOSIS. SO WERE WERE SORT OF. WE'RE GONNA WE'RE PLACE WE DON'T WANT A HOLD OF THE SERVICES THE KIDS ARE GETTING JUST BECAUSE THIS. HOPE WE FOUND WHERE WERE. HAGGLING OVER JI ARE YOU HANDLING KIDS PROPERLY IN THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUE. BUT WE STEPPED INTO IT WHEN WE DID THIS FIVE YEARS AGO AND THAT OF THE BILL IF I COULD THANK YOU SO. COMPLETE VERY GOOD POINTS COMPLETELY GOT THAT FROM YOUR OPENING IT'S JUST. IF IT'S A FEW KIDS AND THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS I WOULD I I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD OPPOSE MAKING SURE THAT THEY. ARE GOING TO AT LEAST GET A REFERRAL TO A PHYSICIAN THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND OF MISTER HOLDEN ITS AREA YOU WANT ADDRESS BUT. THAT I WOULD WANT THEM TO SEE THAT I WOULD WANT THEM TO AND I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AS A REQUIREMENT WHETHER IT'S YOU THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR A MANDATE ON SCHOOL DISTRICT I. I THINK THAT'S LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT'S EVEN BEEN WORKED OUT. AND I WANNA OPEN A CAN OF WORMS BUT AND IF WE IF YOU'RE IS THE CHAIR WILL BE INTENDED TO PULL THIS BACK BECAUSE THIS IS EXACTLY THE COMMITTEE THAT TO BE SEEN WHAT NEXT AMENDMENTS COME FORWARD I WOULD I THINK. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD OPPOSE MAKING SURE THERE'S A REFERRAL FOR THESE KIDS WHO HAVE NOT. FROM YOUR OPENING TESTIMONY THEY HAVEN'T SEEN A DOCTOR THEY DON'T HAVE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS NO I'M SORRY I GUESS ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NOT SEEN A PHYSICIAN. I HAVE I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER COME ACROSS THE CHILD THAT IS NOT SEEN A PHYSICIAN AND IN THE. TWENTY SOME YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN PRACTICE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS DON'T HAVE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS SHUT AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THE GUIDELINES. FROM THE AMERICAN CUT HIM ME A PEDIATRIC STATE THAT EVEN WHEN A CHILD DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC NEURO MOTOR DIAGNOSIS. THAT THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM EDUCATIONALLY. BASED THERAPIES. YOU HAVE THAT PIECE OF PAPER DRIVE YOU THAT RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT OUT OF THE. AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ON DOCUMENT MAKES VERY CLEAR. THAT THEIR CHILDREN COME INTO THE SYSTEMS OFTEN WITHOUT A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND FRANKLY. THERE A LOT OF PARENTS THAT DON'T KNOW SO WE WANT A LABEL ON THEIR KIDS THEY GO THROUGH THE SCHOOL. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR THAT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. IS HEALTH AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT THEIR KID ACCESSING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS GENERALLY IN AS FULLY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. IN THE HOPES THAT THEY HAVE OFF SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS THE FULL REASON WE DO. EARLY INTERVENTION AND SCHOOL BASED SERVICES AND THINGS I'VE BEEN THROUGH SETBACK AT THAT DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH WITHOUT IT IS ME AS WELL AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE. PORTANTINO. MAKE SURE. THAT IT AT SOME POINT THIS IS AN OPEN ENDED AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE. A REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A REFERRAL NOW WHETHER IT'S THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I. WOULD ASK THAT I'M GET TO MY FINAL PART OF QUESTION THE OTHER SIDE TO SORT OF ADDRESS AND YOU HAVE FLEXIBILITY THAT NOT TO STILL BE A MANDATE ON THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH TELLING SCHOOLS YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONES TO PICK. A DOCTOR NOW FOR THESE KIDS ARE YOU NOW HAVE A WHOLE NEW RESPONSIBILITY WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DOES NOT ADEQUATELY FUND IDA AND MANY OTHER THINGS EDUCATION. I KNOW IF YOU WANT A DRESS THAT ONE IF I MAY DO THE CHAIR ARMS DON'T THOSE ARE. THAT THE PRECISE BOXES THAT WERE CHECKING THOSE OF THE TRAPS THAT GONNA RUN THROUGH WE'RE NOT WEDDED TO WHAT PRECISELY THE LANGUAGE LOOKS LIKE. BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'VE AGREED TO BY WAY OF EVEN THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS IS WE ARE ALLOWING. AN EXEMPTION FROM THE FROM THE VISIT LIMITATION OF THE TIME THAT A PHYSICAL THERAPIST CAN TREAT THESE KIDS BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS CURRENTLY IS THEY GET TO THE FORTY FIVE DAY. FORTY SIX DAY THEY CAN NO LONGER PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES IN THE I EP SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS YOU MAY CONTINUE. TO TREAT THAT THAT THAT CHILD WE'RE GRANTING OF THE EXEMPTION FROM THE TREATMENT LIMITATION BUT ALL WERE SAYING WHAT WE'RE REALLY SAYING IS AT SOME POINT. THAT CHILD NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED BY A PHYSICIAN IF THE PHYSICIAN I MEAN WHAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR IS THESE KIDS COME TO US BY WAY OF REFERRAL TO A PEDIATRICIAN. THERE'S PHYSICIANS INVOLVED IN CREATION OF THE IEP PHYSICIANS ARE INVOLVED IN PART OF THE TEAM AND SIGNING OFF ON TREATMENT PLANTS. THAT'S GREAT IF WE CAN CRAFT LANGUAGE JUST AND GIVES US COMFORT LEVEL THAT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT. ARTIFICIALLY LIMITING KIDS ACCESS AYE PROGRAMS BUT THE SAME TIME THERE MAY BE AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT MIGHT BE THE RAINBOW UNICORN CHILD. BUT THERE THEORETICALLY COULD BE A KID BASED ON THIS EXEMPTION. WHO GOES TO AN IEP PROGRAM WHO IS TREATED BY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS WHO CAN HOLD A PENCIL PROPERLY? PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE ON A KID WHO CAN WILL PENCIL PROPER PROPERLY IS NOT GOING TO HELP THAT CHILD IF THE CHILD IS THE ROCK. OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. THAT THE MANDATORY. REQUIREMENT PHYSICAL THERAPIST THAT THEY MERELY REFERS SOMETHING'S OUTSIDE OF THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. IS IS EXCELLENT AND WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A KID THAT DOESN'T OF A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS. THE KID ISN'T WELL YOU KNOW YOU GET IN THAT SITUATION IS IF IT'S LATE ONSET SOMETHING WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOR SHE WAS EYEBALL. AT THAT AND THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME I'M I ALSO DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM I HAVE TO STOP THEIR IP. WELL WELL SOMETHING IS PENDING I I HOPE THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT AND I'M. VERY SYMPATHETIC TO ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS AND. I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT GONNA THROW MONKEY WRENCHES THAT. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WHERE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT YET IN FOLKS ARE WORKING HARD ON IT. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS AGAIN THIS IS MY CHANCE TO SEE IT AND IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. SO. I THINK YOU ARE YOU MIGHT COME IN ON THEMAS CHAIR THANK YOU YES OUR DUES US SO AFTER OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE AND. THINGS AND SO ON WHAT WE'RE GOING TO US IN THE RECENT THANK YOU CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. OF JUST LOOK I HEARD THE COMMENT ABOUT THAT THE UNICORN RAINBOW CHILD. WHOEVER THAT MAY BE THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT HOW MANY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW GAVE A PERCENTAGE OF ABOUT THREE PERCENT. OUT OF THAT THREE PERCENT HOW MANY. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE GETTING THROUGH WITHOUT A MEETING OF POSITION. OR BEING BEING REVIEW AT I DON'T HAVE A. IT. AN ANSWER THAT'S GOING TO BE SHORT THAT LET ME JUST CLARIFY TWO OR THREE POINTS THAT WERE MADE IN CONTEXT OF THAT QUESTION IF I MAY NUMBER ONE IS. IF YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE ICD NINE BEING CONVERTED ICD TEN WE'VE GONE FROM. ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND DIFFERENT COATS TO NOW OVER SIX THE FIVE THOUSAND CODES IS A LOT OF COMEDY IN THE INTO. THERE'S A CODE FOR ABOUT LEFT ARM INJURY ORCA. NON ACUTE RIGHT SO THERE'S A DIAGNOSIS FOR EVERYTHING SO THIS CONCEPT OF US MAKING AN ARTIFICIAL DELINEATION BETWEEN NOT HAVING SEEN THE PHYSICIAN VERSUS NOT HAVING A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS IS THAT IT'S ARTIFICIAL. THE KEY IS IS THAT THESE FOLKS NEED TO BE SEEN AND THAT. NOT JUST GIVEN THE DIAGNOSIS BUT HAVING A DIAGNOSIS RULED OUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG I'LL GIVE YOU A STORY ABOUT MYSELF. WHEN I WAS SIX SEVEN EIGHT YEARS OLD I WAS NOT PARTICULAR COORDINATED HOW BECAME A HAND SURGEON. ANYONE'S GUESS I AM WHEN I RAN. THE OTHER KIDS PARENTS WILL MY MOM ASIDE AND SAID YOU SHOULD GET HIM CHECKED OUT FOR SURE BILL PALSY. NOW LUCKILY MY MOTHER WAS A PEDIATRICIAN AND I DIDN'T HAVE CEREBRAL PALSY BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF KID WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE. A KID WHO PRESENTS WHAT SOME LACK OF COORDINATION AND THEY'RE GETTING TREATMENT. BEFORE EITHER A DIAGNOSIS OR RULE OUT OF DARKNESS. I CAN'T GIVE YOU PERCENTAGES BUT WE WANT TO LOSE EVEN ONE OF THOSE. CHAIRMAN IF I MAY HAVE JUST COULD RESPONSE THAT I MEAN IT JUST REMINDED ME HERE THAT. THIS IS GOING ON FOR THIRTY FIVE FORTY YEARS PRIOR WE INADVERTENTLY CREATIVE PROBLEM IN THE EDUCATIONS. FOR KIDS GETTING IP SERVICES AND FOR KIDS GETTING EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. BECAUSE OF A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION AROUND. PHYSICAL THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME KIND OF INJURY AND GO SEEK PHYSICAL THERAPY TREE. NONE OF US CONTEMPLATED THE SCHOOL BASED SERVICES THAT WERE GOING ON AT THAT TIME OR EARLY INTERVENTION. THERE'S NO HISTORY OR EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER. OF ANY KIND OF ISSUE OR LACK OF REFERRAL BY PHYSICIANS. WHEN ANY OF THESE KINDS OF KIDS COME OUT AND WE'RE BOUND IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU. SUBSECTION A ONE WAS JUST EXISTING LAW. BYNES PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MUST REFER IF THEY SEE THINGS AGO OUTSIDE THEIR SCOPE WHERE THEY NEED FURTHER CONTEMPLATION BY PROFESSIONAL. THAT EXCEEDS WHAT THEY OFFER WAS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY OFFER. THIS EXEMPTION THAT WE HAVE DOES NOT. ALLOW US AN EXEMPTION FROM A ONE IT ONLY ALLOWS US AN EXEMPTION FROM A FOR. WHICH IS THE SECTION THAT DEALS WITH THE FORTY FIVE DAY TWELVE DOES IT. THINGS WERE WERE LITERALLY TRYING TO SATISFY. SCHOOLS AND THE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES PROBLEM THAT WE CREATED. WHEN WE ARE CONTEMPLATING PATIENTS GOING IN AND GETTING HURT PLAYING SOFTBALL OR DOING WHATEVER THEY ARE GOING TO SEE A PHYSICAL THERAPIST SO YEARS SO IT'S MEN I MEAN WE HAVE LITERALLY IF THIRTY FIVE FORTY YEAR TRACK RECORD. A PHYSICAL THERAPIST DOING EXACTLY WHAT GOES ON IN THE SCHOOLS LIKE PEAS AND TO EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. WITHOUT ONE INSTANCE OF US EVER MISSING UPON THAT AND NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE IN THAT. WITHIN A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM. THROUGH THE SCHOOLS THAT DO THESE IP PROCESSES NOTHING CHANGES WERE SO YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING THEN THAT. YOU'RE BOUND TO REFERRAL WHETHER IT'S DAY TEN OR WHETHER IT'S STAY FIFTY FIVE THAT'S RIGHT WE DON'T MISS SEVERAL POLICY BY THE WAY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT YOU KNOW WE WE CASA RUN THESE CLAIMS WERE SUDDENLY GOING TO HAVE A CHILD WHO. THERE'S A MESS WE WOULD KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE ARE MISSING THESE THINGS CANCER OTHERWISE. YOU KNOW WE WOULD GET SUED EVENTUALLY THAT DOESN'T SHOW UP ANYWHERE OUR LIABILITY TRACK RECORD WITH IT LEGISLATURE'S THING SECONDLY COMPLAINTS WHICH IS OFTEN THE LICENSING BOARD WHENEVER I AM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. W. WE CAN GO TO HAVE A FEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ADMIT THIS POINT A DOCTOR ARAMBULA. I'M CONFLICTED ON THIS BILL AND I REALLY FEEL THAT I MUST SHARE SOME OF IT FOR THE GOOD OF THIS. COMMITTEE BUT ALSO FOR THE AUTHOR. RESPECT THAT YOU BRING THIS BILL FORWARD YOU IT SEEMS LIKE THE SPONSORS ARE REALLY ATTEMPTING TO FIX UP. AN ISSUE THAT IS BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE THOUSAND BUT AB ONE THOUSAND IS THE LAW FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO I LOOK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEXT LAWS WERE PASSING ARE ACTUALLY FIXING A. AN ISSUE IN A CORRECT WAY AND MY COMMENTARY IF I CAN JUST FROM HEARING THE DELIBERATION OF THIS COMMITTEE IS IT'S NOT QUITE COOKED YET. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T GET TO A PLACE BUT I FEEL I NEED TO SHARE THE FACT THAT I'M NOT IN A VOTE FOR THIS TODAY NOT BECAUSE I DON'T. BELIEVE THE AUTHOR DOESN'T HAVE IT WITHIN HIS HEART TO FIX PROBLEM BUT. WE HAVEN'T REACHED AN END POINT THAT NEEDS ALL OF OUR NEEDS AND. WHAT I'M HEARING IS? THE SUPPORTERS SAY THEY BATTED A THOUSAND FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AND I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE ON ITS FACE. THAT YOU'VE GONE EVERY ISSUE ALWAYS PERFECT. AND WHAT I WONDER IS WHAT ROLE WE S.. CAN PLAY IN. IN THIS INTERFACE IN IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT FROM PLACE TO HELP TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE CATCHING EVERYTHING. I DON'T WANT TO LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR PHYSICAL THERAPIST TO DO THEIR JOB WELL. I THINK THEY'VE DONE IT WELL. BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. AND. I. JUST WANTED TO ADD MY TWO CENTS IN MY COMMENTS FOR WHERE I AM BUT IF WE ARE ABLE TO GET THIS BILL TO A PLACE WITH AMENDMENTS. I CAN SEE MYSELF VOTING FOR THIS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT. CONTINUE DIALOGUE AND WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS AS THIS BILL. CONTINUES TO SOME. THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. THANK YOU AYE AYE YEAH LOOK I. I RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A. SORT OF A DISCONNECT ON IN TERMS OF HOW. WE'RE OPERATING UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND THEN OF COURSE UNDER OUR STATE LOSS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS. OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WE ARE TRYING HARD TO MAKE SURE DO NOT FALL. BETWEEN THE CRACKS IN THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET. A PROPER EDUCATION. AND WE WORK VERY HARD TO THIS POINT. WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CHAIR. AND WITH THOSE WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION ONE PARTY HAS REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION ALTHOUGH THERE'S INDICATION. OF CONTINUING TO WALK TO WORK WITH US AND WE CONTINUING TO ONE AND WORK WITH THEM. AND SO I THINK THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT. WE SHOWED GREAT. DILIGENCE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. JUST NOT HERE. OF WHAT WAS BEING SAID AS CONCERNS BUT TO REALLY TAKE SOME CORRECTIVE. ACTIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHARPEN. OF THE POINTS THAT I THOUGHT NEEDED TO BE MADE AND TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. AS I INDICATED IN MY OPENING STATEMENT WE WILL CONTINUE. TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WILL CONTINUE TO. OF FIND WAYS THAT. THE ISSUE OF REFERRALS AND GRAMMY. EXPANDING OR INCLUDING AS MANY VOICES. AND THE TRIALS OF DEVELOPMENT ARE CAN BE MADE AS POSSIBLE. BUT WE ALSO WERE OPERATING UNDER. CERTAIN LIMITATIONS THAT ALLOWS. TO KEEP US FROM GOING MAYBE AS FAR. AS WE WOULD LIKE OR WOULD NEED TO SO I CAN ONLY COMMIT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO. THE OTHER KIND OF DUE DILIGENCE AND. COOPERATIVE FOR. WORKING TOGETHER. TO TRY TO HAVE THE BEST BILL BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. I'M NOT. I SEE THE SAME WAY AS YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE I I WON A BILL THAT'S GOING TO MAKE. THE SITUATION BETTER AB ONE THOUSAND CREATED SORT OF THESE. IMPRESSIONS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING TO SORT OF SHORING UP. AND THAT. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. THAT A BILL HAS COME BACK COME BEFORE US TO TRY TO GO BACK AND. TO TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING BETTER THERE WAS OUR INTENTION TO SEE ADDRESS THAT MAY NOT HAVE. ALL BEEN DONE. AS THOROUGHLY AS POSSIBLE AND SO. ARE WE OPEN OURSELVES UP CONTINUING TO. TO USE TO SEEK A MORE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE. IT'S A VERY LUCKY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HOLTON NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO THOUGHT THAT THOSE WERE HOLDS. SENATOR. NTFC IT TO ME MISTER GOLDMAN. AND AND I WOULD SUPPORT THE BILL. TODAY I TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES AS WE ALL DO WHEN WE WILL MOVE BILLS. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE PROCESS. I HAVE. BUT. I I'M FRANKLY. OKAY WITH THE BILL THE WAY IT IS IN ITS CURRENT FORM. OF PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE ARE. TRAIN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THEY'RE A VERY VALUABLE PART OF THE. HEALTHCARE TEAM AND THEY'RE TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND WHEN THERE NEEDS TO BE A PHYSICIAN REFERRAL. I'VE HEARD NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT DOESN'T. KNOW WHAT IT IS TODAY THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY EVIDENCE. I JUST DON'T SEE OF WHAT LIES BILL IS NOT RIGHT MOVE FORWARD SO I'M HAPPY TO. SUPPORTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS BLOOM WAS A. THANK YOU A. THINKING ABOUT MUCH YOU DON'T BRING THIS BILL FOR I'LL ALSO BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY INTERESTED YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES. I. WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW AS YOU MIGHT WAY FOR SICK LAST YEAR PRETTY SEVERE BUT A SPINAL TUMOR. THAT IS GONNA NEED ONGOING PHYSICAL THERAPY AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND EVERY TIME WE HIT THAT. SIX SIX VISITS OR WHATEVER VISITS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND GET A REFERRAL AGAIN WHICH CAN STOP TREATMENT FOR UP TO A MONTH FREQUENTLY. FREQUENT UP TO A MONTH THAT WE HAVE TO THEN WAIT TO GET ANOTHER REFERRAL. TO GO BACK AGAIN ON AND THAT DELAY IN SERVICES I CAN TELL YOU IS. IS IS SIGNIFICANT WHAT IT CAN DO ESPECIALLY THEN FOR A CHILD WHO IS DEVELOPING THE LONG. A SOMEBODY IN THEIR LATE FIFTIES TRYING TO RECOVER FROM SOMETHING. SO I JUST YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR YOU KNOW THE POSITION NEEDS TO HAVE THEIR EYES ON THERE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I. WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS GOT A THREE YEAR OLD WHO IS NOW HAS AN IEP AND IS GETTING SERVICES AND SHE GOT THE SERVICE BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU DOCTOR REALIZE AT FIRST NOW. WOULDN'T KNOW SHE'S IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. SO I JUST CAN'T CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I THINK. ANY TIME WE CAN MAKE SERVICES BE CONSISTENT AND AND ESPECIALLY WE'RE SEEING PROGRESS WE NEED TO CONTINUE THOSE NOT STOP TO GO BACK TO SOME BILLS AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME.

BUT TO MAKE IT. MORE RESPONSIVE AND REFLECTIVE OF THE ISSUE OF REFERRALS AND HOW TO CONTINUE TO. ENGAGE THE PHYSICIAN AND THIS PROCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I THINK WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN TERMS OF. COVERING A LOT OF THE GROUND THAT WAS LAID OUT THERE WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROCESS IN TERMS OF. OBJECTIONS OR OUR CONCERNS TO HOW THIS BILL WAS GOING TO ADDRESS. MOVE IN THE WAY THAT IT DID IT SO. ARE I CAN JUST AGAIN COMMITTEE YOU THAT WE WILL. I CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS.

ALRIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AB TWO TWO EIGHT ONE. ALLOWS MEDICAL LABORATORY TECHNICIANS OR A MULTISPORT FORM THREE ADDITIONAL TESTS OF MODERATE COMPLEXITY. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA MULTISPORT FOR CLINICAL LAB TESTS CLASSIFIED AS SIMPLE FOR OF THIS AS MODERATE. AS NOTED IN A RECENT STUDY BY UCSF ALL OTHER STATES ALLOW MLT USED TO PERFORM BOTH MODERATE AND HIGH COMPLEXITY TESTING WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS. THE THREE EXAMS THAT WE ARE INCLUDING. ARE CONSIDERED OF MODERATE COMPLEXITY BY THE CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS CATEGORIZATION AND MANY ARE PERFORMED USING INSTRUMENTATION THAT IS CONSIDERED OF MODERATE COMPLEXITY. IN ADDITION THERE ARE READY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF THESE TESTS SINCE CALIFORNIA REQUIRES THAT THE TESTS ARE CONDUCTED BY. THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY A MULTI IS BE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A PHYSICIAN. SURGEON OR HIGHLY EDUCATED PROFESSIONAL THIS BILL WILL ENABLE TECHNICIANS TO PRACTICE THE SKILLS THAT THEY ARE TRAINED FOR. AND THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THAT AND THAT THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES ARE READY PERFORMING. ALSO OUR STATE'S LABORATORIES WILL GREATLY BENEFIT FROM THIS IT'S THIS BILL CAN. IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR LAB PERSONNEL. ALLOWING ADULTS USE TO PERFORM THESE THREE HIGH VOLUME TESTS WILL FREE UP THE TIME OF CLINICAL LAB SCIENTIST SO THAT THEY MAY FOCUS ON THE MOST CHALLENGING LAB TESTS FOR THESE REASONS. AB TWO TWO EIGHT ONE WILL MODERNIZE OUR LABORATORY WORKFORCE WITH ME HERE IN SUPPORT IS THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PATHOLOGISTS. AND THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF LABORATORIES AT UCSF DOCTOR TO. IT WAS OUR TURN MEMBERS BOB BACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY PATHOLOGISTS BUT ALL IT IS OUR POSITION TO SPECIALIZED LABORATORY MEDICINE AND WE ARE SPONSORING THIS BILL. AS A WAY TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE ISSUES THE WORKFORCE ISSUES AND HEALTH CARE REFORM ARE OFTEN DISCUSSED THIS IS A VERY MINOR CHANGE TO THE LAW. IF THIS BILL PASSES IT WILL STILL BE THE MOST RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION FOR A MULTI USE IN THE UNITED STATES SO. I HAVE DOCTOR HAMMILL FROM A FORMER DRUG ABUSE YOURSELF TALK ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF THIS. OF BUT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE. I'VE BEEN A LABORATORY DIRECTOR OR WHAT'S LABORATORY DIRECTOR FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR YEARS I'VE WORKED FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS ON LABORATORY WORKFORCE ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED LABORATORY TECHNOLOGISTS IN THIS STATE OVER A DECADE AGO. OF THE LEGISLATURE WISELY PASSED A LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR A SECONDARY CATEGORY OF LICENSURE FOR OUR LABORATORIES THAT'S THE MLP. A LICENSING CATEGORY UNFORTUNATELY THE PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE OF THEIR SCOPE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE IN THAT LEGISLATION HAS LED TO A PROBLEM WITH LABORATORIES BEING ABLE TO HIRE. AND RETAIN THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR LABORATORIES ARE JUST TOO MANY LARGE VOLUME TESTS THAT THEY CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN BECAUSE OF THEIR SCOPE LIMITATIONS. WITHOUT THIS MY WORRY IS THAT WHILE WE'VE GENERATED MLT TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THE STATE AND WE ARE NOW TURNING OUT AND THEY'LL TEASE. MOST OF THOSE ARE GOING OUT OF STATE TO PRACTICE BECAUSE THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING THAT A CLS CAN DO. AND VIRTUALLY EVERY STATE IN THE UNION EXCEPT CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT SUCH CHANGES THAT ALLOW THESE PEOPLE TO BE PLACED IN CALIFORNIA LABORATORIES. CHANCES ARE WE'RE GOING TO YOU'D LOSE THOSE MLT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND FURTHER IN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE A CALIFORNIANS FACING.

LOCAL TWENTY. WE HAVE SIX THOUSAND MEMBERS ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING BOTH PENALTIES AND THE MEDICAL AT TAX IN CLINICAL LAB SCIENTIST. WE STILL RATE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE SPELL ARM BUT ONE I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN STAFF FOR. BEING OPEN TO MEETING WITH US IN HEARING OUR CONCERNS I'M WE FEEL THAT BLOOD SMEARS URINALYSIS IN HBO ARE EACH TESTING. WHICH ARE ALL COMPLEX OR MODERATELY COMPLEX INVOLVE A DISCRETIONARY COMPONENT MEANING THAT THEIR BEST LEFT IN THE HANDS OF CLINICAL LAB SCIENTIST YOU ARE BETTER TRAINED AND EDUCATED TO PERFORM THEM. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS CREATES POTENTIAL ON PATIENT HEALTH RISKS AS BLOOD SMEARS ARE USED IN THE DIAGNOSIS. UP SERIOUS CONDITIONS SUCH AS LYMPHOMA AND LEUKEMIA AND THEN OBVIOUSLY A FAULTY BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND WOOD. COULD BE DEADLY I'M WE WE DO AGREE PHILOSOPHICALLY WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN. I SPEAKING ABOUT WE WE THINK THAT THERE ARE A SHORTAGE OF BOTH CLINICAL LAB SCIENTIST MEDICAL LAB TAX ACROSS THE STATE. HOWEVER WE THINK THAT WE NEED MORE TRAINING PROGRAMS NOT TO TAKE SOME OF THAT THAT. HER EXCUSE ME IT TAKES IN THE TASKS AND REASSIGN THEM TO MEDICAL LAB TAX. ON WE DON'T THINK THAT MEDICAL LAB TECHS ARE LEAVING THE STATE. AND TO WORK IN LOWER PAID OCCUPATIONS JUST SO THEY CAN PRACTICE. I'M THEY CAN PRACTICE MORE TESTS I'M AND. I BROUGHT WITH ME TODAY MARJORIE BROUGHT SHE'S A CLINICAL LAB SCIENTIST AT THE KAISER RICHMOND LAB IN THE EAST BAY AND SHE WANTS TO SAY A FEW MORE WORDS ABOUT THESE TESTS THANK YOU. GREATLY ADDITIONAL ONE MINUTE THANK YOU PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME IT'S MY TREE PROCESS AND. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO GIVE THIS TESTAMENT TO YOU. I AM A CLINICAL LAB SCIENTIST AND I HAVE A FEELING THAT EXCEPT FOR MAYBE OUR POSITION ON THE BOARD MOST IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF WHAT I DO. AND AS A A CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENTISTS THE PHYSICIANS RELY ON EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEIR DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON THE TESTING THAT I DO. I ALSO WANNA POST. TELL YOU ABOUT THE TESTING THAT IS. BEING. RECLASSIFIED BY THIS BILL. IT IS NOT A LOW LEVEL OF TESTING ALL OF THESE TESTS ARE DONE MANUALLY THEY ARE DONE BY A. COMBINATION OF MICROSCOPY. AND ALSO THEY ARE GAUGED BY THEIR INTENSITY. FOR IN THE BLOOD BANK FOR THEIR OF ABILITY TO. THE REACTIONS WHICH CAUSE WHICH IS NEEDED BY A. HIGHLY TRAINED PERSON I ACTUALLY HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE IN ADDITION TO MY BACHELORS AND OVER TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENTISTS ALSO IN THESE AREAS WE HAVE SPECIALISTS. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO TECHNICAL. WE ARE SPECIALISTS IN BLOOD BANKING WE A SPECIALIST IN HEMATOLOGY. ALL OF THESE TESTS ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX INTENDED WAY OR ANOTHER. I'M SORRY. UP AND SO I AND I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT ACTUALLY WITH BLOOD BANKING. AT THERE IS ARM. OUT STRAIGHT TO ALL OTHER MODERATELY COMPLEX TESTS. THAT ANY TEST. THAT IS. DESIGNATED FOR HBO COMPATIBILITY RECIPIENT OR THE DONOR MIGHT USE. HIGHLY COMPLEX THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WORDS AT ALL ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SAY NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. DOCTOR AND. I WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND TO HEAR FROM THE PATHOLOGISTS THEMSELVES AS WELL. I'M HAVING PRACTICED IN THE HE ARE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO GET TIMELY INFORMATION AND THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A. MODERATE ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO HAVE TRAINED PROFESSIONALS TO. ANALYZE AND ONE OF THE REASONS I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL AS IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE RATIO OF. CLINICAL. SCIENTIST TO THE EMERALD HE'S AND BECAUSE YOU DON'T CHANGE THE SUPERVISION YOU NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOPEFULLY TRAIN THOSE COMMITTEES TO DO SOME OF. THE TEST THAT ARE PUT FORWARD AND THE BLOOD SMEARS AND MICHAEL. MICROSCOPIC URINALYSIS ARE IMPORTANT STUDIES BUT I DO THINK THEY ARE TEST THAT WE CAN HELP. OUR ANIMAL TEASE TO BE TRAINED UP TO AND I'M HOPEFUL WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL HAVE AN INCREASED OPPORTUNITY TO. BE ABLE TO GET MORE TIMELY INFORMATION AND TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN OUR SPECIALIST SO. WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MATTER FORWARD AND. WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEE NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS RICKETY MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN COMMENTS AND AND THESE ARE THE THREE TESTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED A MODERATE COMPLEXITY AGAIN I WILL SAY THAT BY THE TIME CLIA AND AND IT DEFINITELY.
