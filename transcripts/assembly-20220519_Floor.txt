THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER HOBBY HARVEY MILK DAY I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LGBTQ CAUCUS TO PRESENT HR ONE OH NINE TODAY WE WILL HONOR HARVEY MILK A HERO AND THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY HARVEY WAS THE FIRST OPENLY GAY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN CALIFORNIA AND IN ANY MAJOR UNITED STATES CITY. HE'S A GLOBAL ICON AND A PIONEER IN THE LGBTQ CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. HARVEY OF COURSE UNSUCCESSFULLY RAN IN SEVERAL LOCAL ELECTIONS BUT HIS PERSISTENCE PAID OFF IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHEN HE WAS ELECTED TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. HIS UNPRECEDENTED ELECTION VICTORY AND THE WAVES HE MADE IN JUST ONE YEAR CONTINUE TO INSPIRE US TODAY AS WE INCREASE REPRESENTATION ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. WORKING TO FIGHT HOMOPHOBIA AND OTHER FORMS OF LGBTQ DISCRIMINATION MILK WAS OFTEN THE LOUDEST VOICE AT A TIME WHEN MANY WERE AFRAID TO BE THEMSELVES. HE ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THE SHOW PRIDE AND EXPRESS THEIR TRUE IDENTITIES. DURING HIS TERM ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HARVEY MILK SPONSORED AND SUCCESSFULLY PASS A GAY RIGHTS ORDINANCE AND WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN DEFEATING PROPOSITION SIX THE BRIGGS INITIATIVE. AT THE GENERAL ELECTION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD HAVE BANNED GAYS AND LESBIANS FROM TEACHING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS ACROSS OUR STATE. HARVEY MILK WAS ALSO SUCCESSFUL IN FORGING COALITIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO'S OTHER MINORITY LEADERS. HIS MESSAGE WAS ONE OF UNITY AGAINST OPPRESSION AND ALL OF ITS FORMS. IN HIS GAY FREEDOM DAY SPEECH HE SAID I CALL UPON ALL MINORITIES AND ESPECIALLY THE MILLIONS OF LESBIANS AND GAY MEN TO WAKE UP FROM THEIR DREAMS. TO GATHER ON WASHINGTON AND TELL THEIR NATION WAKE UP. WAKE UP AMERICA NO MORE RACISM NO MORE SEXISM NO MORE AGES THEM NO MORE HATRED NO MORE TRAGICALLY CUT SHORT AFTER A FORMER COLLEAGUE ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ASSASSINATED HIM. AND SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR GEORGE MOSCONE. HARVEY'S KILLER WAS CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER INSTEAD OF MURDER AND JUSTICE THAT SPARKED RIOTS. THE OUTCOME OF THAT TRIAL SERVES AS A STARK REMINDER THAT WE MUST ALWAYS BE VIGILANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IS IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. HI EVERYONE SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T LIVE ON HOPE ALONE BUT WITHOUT HOPE LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING. AND IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE YET TO ENSURE EQUALITY FOR ALL HARRY'S IMPACT AS A TRAILBLAZER AND CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATES.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH KERKORIAN SOME PEOPLE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE TO CANNABIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SPENT THE RECOGNIZED. THE SERVER WORKING UP THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. OUR STATE IS DEALING WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWS. MORE THAN EVER BEFORE THE PASSING OF PROP SIXTY FOUR- WE ALLEVIATE THIS STRAIN ON THE LEGAL MARKET IT IS NECESSARY TO INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE. ENSURE THAT NON COMPLIANCE WILL BE FINANCIALLY CUMBERSOME. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT DOES EXACTLY THAT. IT INCREASES THE COST BURDEN OF FINES SIGNIFICANTLY ON ANY OPERATION THAT CHOOSES TO REMAIN IN NONCOMPLIANCE AND THEY SHOULD SHOULDER THE COST. THE BILL OFFERS AN AMNESTY PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. THIS IS A BUILDINGS THE IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FIXING THE PITFALLS OF LEGALIZATION. ENSURING THAT THE VOTERS INTENDED OF A LEGAL INDUSTRY TO THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY RECOGNIZED. YEAH RESPECTFULLY- MADAM CHAIR QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE HIGH DESERT WE HAVE AN- EVER INCREASING- PROBLEM WITH THIS- ILLEGAL GROW SITUATION AND SO I WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE. THIS MEASURE WHICH SEEMS TO FOCUS ON PENALIZING THESE ILLEGAL GROWERS ARE YOU TOOK A- AN AMENDMENT IN JUDICIARY AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT AMENDMENT DOES NOT DIMINISH FROM THAT THAT INTENT YOU JUST INDICATED SO IF YOU COULD JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND DEMAND THAT YOU TOOK THERE. I'D BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. M. THE AMENDMENT GIVES THEM A WINDOW TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE BILL AT ALL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRKIER RECOGNIZED. AW YES HI- I AM WRITING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT- ONE OF THE REASONS THERE'S A PROBLEM. TEKELI IN THE HIGH DESERT IS A ITS REMOTENESS BUT ALSO SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY HAS VERY FEW CITIES THAT HAVE ALLOWED CANNABIS- AND I HOPE THAT CHANGES BECAUSE THAT'LL ALSO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IF PEOPLE CAN GET IT LEGALLY THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET IT ILLEGALLY. IN THE MEANTIME THIS IS A GOOD STEP OF THE WITH THE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THE CANNABIS GROUPS NVOLVED WITHDRAWN THEIR OPPOSITION AND I HEARD YOU KNOW VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FULLY RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I JUST WANT TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE ACTUAL WANT TO BRING THE ATTENTION OF THE HOUSE SURE THE BACKSTORY TO HOW WE GOT TO A BILL LIKE THIS YOU KNOW THE VOTERS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX APPROVED THE COMPASSIONATE USE ACT IN CALIFORNIA. THIS DEALT WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA AND ONE PASSED IN NINETY SIX THE ACT SAID. THE LEGISLATURE. WILL COME IN BEHIND THIS ACT PASSED BY VOTERS AND ADOPT GUIDELINES. FOR TWENTY YEARS THE LEGISLATURE TOOK THAT ISSUE UP. DEBATED FOR YEAR THE WHEELS CAME OFF THE LAST MINUTE AND IT DIED. THIS TRYING TO MAKE ANY FRAMEWORK FOR MARIJUANA OF ANY TIME. IT WAS LIKE GROUNDHOG DAY EVERY YEAR WE RENEWED IT EVERY YEAR WE RENEWED EVERY YEAR WE RENEW IT UNTIL TWENTY OF FIFTEEN. WHEN AN EFFORT WAS UNDERTAKEN IN THIS BODY A BI PARTISAN EFFORT TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE WHICH HAD BEEN THIS ASTONISHING GORDON NOT A PUBLIC POLICY. AND DOES HAVE PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE BECAUSE WE GOT TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE. STARTED MOVING AT THE SENATE SORT OF FALL WHEN WE ALREADY DID THE SAME THING. THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE HORSEPOWER DIDN'T I HAVE THE BACK IN THAT HOUSE ON THE DAY WHEN THE SENATE PACKAGE GOT OUT WITH TWENTY ONE VOTES IT PASSED OFF THIS FOR BIPARTISAN SIXTY FOUR VOTES IN SUPPORT. AND THAT ENERGIZED THE WHOLE SUING DEBATE. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS AMENDMENT. THE BALLOT PROPOSITION DEAL WITH CANNABIS MORE GENERALLY. WAS RE WRITTEN TO REFLECT A LOT OF THE APPROACH YOU CAME ON THE WHOLE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BREAKTHROUGH THAT THIS HOUSE CRITICALLY INJURED HERE AND SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING BUT I WHAT WHAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS ASSEMBLY TO REALIZE IT WAS THIS BODY. THAT SET THE WHOLE CONVERSATION MOST AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF FAILURE AND WE DIDN'T COLLABORATIVELY ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS- THANK YOU MR COOLEY. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH YOU MAKE BOTH. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS FROM MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WHAT THAT WORK WILL OPEN THEIR OWN.
