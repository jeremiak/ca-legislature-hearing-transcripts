TO TWO PEOPLE PER SIDE WITH TWO MINUTES PER PERSON WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE'RE GOING TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE. AND OUR FIRST AUTHOR IS SENATOR BELL SENATOR BILL COME ON DOWN. BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OF IF USER PLEASURE ALL STAR WITH SP. ONE FIFTY JUST FINE THANK YOU -- PROUD TO PRESENT SP ONE FIFTY THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL IMPROVE. THE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOU. BY EXPANDING THEIR ACCESS TO THE CHAFEE GRANT -- I'M GOING -- TO SEE WE GET WITNESSES OF HERE THEY ARE EARLIER OKAY. MEASURE DECIDED TO FOR ALL MY COMMENTS TO SO YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE WITNESSES. VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND I'LL JUST LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE SUPPORT SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. SO WITNESSES YOU HAVE YOU CAN PICK TWO PEOPLE ARE TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE THE PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCES TRAFFIC GRANT ISSUE SO WE'LL. HAVE THEM AND THEY'RE FOR FORMER FOSTER VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR BELL WHO WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS DEBBIE RUSHER AND I AM WITH JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT FOSTER YOUTH ENTER COLLEGE WITH SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CHALLENGES AND OTHER STUDENTS FOSTER YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE TRAUMA OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. HAVE OFTEN BEEN FORCED TO CHANGE HOMES AND SCHOOLS FREQUENTLY ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A DISABILITY AND ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO TEST BELOW PROFICIENCY IN MATH AND ENGLISH THAN OTHER STUDENTS. ONCE THEY ARRIVE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS THEY STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS A JUST RELEASED STUDY FOUND THAT A STAGGERING 43% OF FOSTER YOUTH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS A RATE MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT OF OTHER STUDENTS. AS A RESULT FROSTY'S OFTEN FARE POORLY IN PARTICULAR DURING THEIR FIRST YEARS ACCLIMATED CALLED THE COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT. A COMMUNITY COLLEGES OVER HALF OF THE STUDENTS DO NOT ATTAIN A TWO POINT OH GPA. ONE KEY COMPONENT TO CALLED SUCCESS IS ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FINANCIAL AID THE CHAFEE GRANT PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND PROVIDES CRITICAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR CURRENT FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ATTENDING COLLEGE SB ONE FIFTY SIX TO IMPROVE HOW THIS PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED. TO HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE IMPACT ON FOSTER YOUTH ATTENDING COLLEGE. THERE ARE TWO PROVISIONS THE FIRST WOULD AUTHORIZE C. SACK TO UPDATE ITS AWARDING PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE FUNDS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WHEN FUNDS ARE MOST NEEDED. TYPICALLY THE PROCESS TAKES A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROTOCOL. RESULTING IN STUDENTS RECEIVING THEIR AWARDS AT THE END IS THAT LATE IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR. I WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO WOULD AUTHORIZE C. SACK TO AWARD MORE THAN THE TOTAL ALLOCATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. KNOWING THAT STUDENTS WILL ULTIMATELY NOT CLAIM THEIR AWARDS SO THAT MORE STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE FUNDS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. THIS PROCESS HAS ALREADY BEEN USED EFFECTIVELY FOR THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRAHAM. THE SECOND PROVISION WOULD PROVIDE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR FOSTER YOUTH. WHO DO NOT MEET SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS STANDARDS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR? TYPICALLY STUDENTS WHO DON'T MEET SAP LOSE ALL FINANCIAL AID IN THEIR FIRST YEAR AND ONE YEAR IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO JUDGE OF A FOSTER YOUTH CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. GIVEN HOW MANY CHALLENGES THE STUDENTS FACE IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. ONCE ALL FINANCIAL AID IS LOST THE LIKELIHOOD OF REMAINING AND ROLL DROPS PRECIPITOUSLY. UNLIKE MOST STUDENTS THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE A FAMILY HOME TO RETURN TO WIN FINANCIAL AID IS A LOST. A MORE LIKELY SCENARIO FOR THE STUDENTS IS HOMELESSNESS AND DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE. ALLOWING THE STUDENTS TO MAINTAIN THE CHAFEE GRANT FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR WILL PROVIDE A BRIDGE THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO REMAIN ENROLLED IN COLLEGE WELL THEY WORK TO IMPROVE THEIR ACADEMIC STANDING. AND REGAIN ACCESS TO OTHER FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID. AND WE HAVE TO US STUDENTS HERE WHO ARE GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. GREAT WE WERE ABOUT THREE MINUTES INTO YOUR FOUR MINUTES BUT WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME SENT SENATOR BILL DEFERRED TEO SO FIRST -- WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME'S EXIT OVER MOUNTAIN AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE SP. ONE FIFTY AND TWO IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS TWO YEARS OLD. AFTER A FAILED ADOPTION I REENTERED AT AGE FIFTEEN AND REMAIN FOSTER CARE UNTIL I AM AS BETTER AGE. EIGHTEEN ONE FIVE SECURE DURING THOSE THREE YEARS I WENT TO FIVE DIFFERENT PLACEMENT OF FIVE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS BY FOCUS DURING THOSE -- THOSE YEARS WAS JUST ON SURVIVING BUT I DID MANAGE TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. I KNEW THAT HIGHER EDUCATION WAS THE KEY TO MY FUTURE AND SO I WROTE IN COLLEGE OF SAN JOAQUIN DELTA COLLEGE BUT THE FIRST YEAR WAS VERY ROUGH. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY AND ALL SUPPORT TO HELP ME NAVIGATE THE PROCESS AND I WAS NEEDING -- NEEDING TO WORK TO SUPPORT MYSELF. I STILL HAD THE MENTALITY OF FOCUSING ON MY IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL NEEDS WHICH DIDN'T LEAVE ME MUCH ROOM TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. I WAS DOING MY BEST TO MOVE IN -- MOVE MY LIFE FOR IT AND PULL MYSELF UP BY MY BOOTSTRAPS BUT THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES HAT I NEEDED TO DO. AND THAT I AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN JUST WEREN'T. THERE. AS A RESULT MACINNES DURING THE FIRST YEAR ONE GRAY AND I DID NOT MAKE S. A. P.. THIS MEANT THAT I A LOST MY PHONE MY FINANCIAL AID MY PELL GRANT MY CAL GRANT MI CHAFEE GRANT -- LOSE MY FINANCIALLY WAS A ONE WAY TICKET OUT OF COLLEGE THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME TO STAY AND ROLL WITHOUT FUNDING SO I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL. TWO YEARS LATER WE DECIDED TO RETURN TO COLLEGE BUT FOUND THAT I DIDN'T GET A FINANCE WAY BECAUSE OF MY PREVIOUS -- SAP DISQUALIFICATION. I TOOK A TOOK ME EIGHT MONTHS TO GET ANY FINANCIAL AID BACK AS I HAD TO GET MY GPA UP. AT AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL BEFORE THE SCHOOL COULD GIVE ME ANY FINANCIAL AID. DURING THAT TIME I HAD TO WORK FOR OLD FULL TIME IN ORDER TO PAY RENT AND BUY BOOKS WHILE ALSO TRYING TO GO TO SCHOOL. ONCE I APPROVED FOR FINANCIAL AID IT WAS STILL ANOTHER MONTH BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE CHAFEE GRAHAM. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN FNANCIAL AID I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE COLLEGE AT A LOT A LOT SOONER RATE. TODAY I MEAN U. S. C. -- GRADUATE STUDENTS SEEM TO BE ALUMNI I'M ALSO A PROUD ADVOCATE FOR FOX YOUTH. THOUGH I HAVE OVERCOME THE PREDETERMINE CITIZENS THAT SHADOW FOSTER. MANY FAST YOU STILL STRIVE TO REACH THE END OF THE TUNNEL. BUT WHILE FOR ME THE LHASA FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE AT THE DEL A DELAY FOR MANY OTHER STUDENTS THEY ARE NEVER ABLE TO RETURN INCOMPLETE THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION. THE CHANGES PROPOSED -- CHAFEE GRANT PROGRAM IN SB ONE FIGHT IT WILL OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANY FAST YOU TO TO VANCE AND EDUCATIONALLOW THEM. TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN. TO BEAT THE ODDS AND SO I LIKE TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL. ONE FORTY ONE FIFTY THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. HI CENTER. THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE FOR LETTING A SPEAKER TODAY. SB ONE FIFTY MEANS A LOT TO US HERE JAY BAY AND I BELIEVE MANY OTHER FOSTER YOUTH. I PERSONALLY HAD. GONE THROUGH. THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN AND THEN GOT PLACE TO MANY DIFFERENT TIMES. AND WENT THROUGH A GROUP HOME FIRST THAT HAD. PLACED ME AT A A SCHOOL THAT WAS MORE CONVENIENT BECAUSE MANY OTHER GIRLS IN THE GROUP PALMER GOING THERE. SO THAT'S KIND OF SET ME BACK A LITTLE BIT MY EDUCATION DISCOURAGE ME TO FINISH AND ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE TURNING EIGHTEEN MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER. SHE HAD -- HAD A DECISION TO MAKE IN A SEPARATE COURT AND CRIMINAL COURT WHETHER SHE'S GOING TO GO DOWN FROM A FELONY OR PROBATION. SO I HAD A DECISION TO EITHER REUNIFY WITH HER NOT AND IT KIND OF HELPED HER CASE IN CRIMINAL COURT SO. FOR ME I DECIDED TO REUNIFY WITH HER -- BECAUSE SHE IS STILL MY BIOLOGICAL MOM. HOWEVER IT DID JUST CALL FROM FIVE ME FROM LIKE AB TWELVE OR OTHER HOUSING PROGRAMS SO AFTER I TURNED EIGHTEEN I WAS ELIGIBLE TO DO THOSE -- AND STAY IN THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND I KNEW WHAT I ATE REUNIFIED WITH HER THAT I WASN'T GOING TO GET SUPPORT AFTER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN BUT I MADE THAT DECISION ANYWAYS AND I STRUGGLED WITH IT. AND EVENTUALLY WENT BACK TO ADULT SCHOOL AND I GOT MY DIPLOMA AFTER A LONG TIME. IT WAS NOT EASY. AND I IT WAS ONLY FIVE CREDITS AWAY TOO SO IT WASN'T TOO TEDIOUS AND AFTER THAT I ALSO ENROLLED IN THE LOCAL JUNIOR COLLEGE WHICH WAS NOT THE EASIEST PROCESSED. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I WAS IN FOSTER CARE AND FRESNO COUNTY AND I WAS GOING TO COLLEGE IN MODESTO SO GETTING THAT APPROVED AND ALL OF THAT WAS DIFFICULT SO TO GET MY CHIEF YOU RIGHT AWAY. AND THAT WOULD HAVE KIND OF HELP ME AND ALSO BEING HOMELESS WAS KIND OF A STE. KIND OF DIFFICULT. BECAUSE YOU KIND OF FOCUS ON LIKE WE'RE GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND NOT NECESSARILY WE'RE GOING TO STUDY IN SCHOOL THAT DAY. SO FOR ME. I GOT A JOB AND THEN I GOT A SECOND JOB AND I DEBATED ON THE THIRD JOB BUT MY GRADES STARTED SLIPPING AS I WAS DOING THAT -- HAD I GOT THIS CHIEF YOU GRANT -- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR ME TO MOVE ON AND KIND OF FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS AND LIKE THE BIGGER PICTURE OF WHERE I WANT TO GO WITH MY EDUCATION. AND THAT'S WHY SB ONE FIFTY ABSOLUTE MEANS THE MOST TO ME AND I KNOW MANY OTHER YOUTH THAT WOULD MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE. TO I THINK THAT EXTRASUPPORT OF THE STATE SAYING LIKE I CO AND WE WERE THERE ONCE. FOR YOUR JOURNEY IN FOSTER CARE AND WE'RE STILL HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT TESTIMONY. OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ALL PRESENT THIS BILL THIS IS -- SB EIGHT OF FIVE EIGHTY TWO IT'S A CRITICAL COMPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE EQUITY. IN TRIAGE GRANTS FUNDS FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND RESTORING THE 40% CUT. IN TRIAGE GRANTS IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN ADDITION THIS BILL REQUIRES HALF OF THE MENTAL HEALTH TRIAGE. FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUTH PROGRAMS BY INCENTIVIZING COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PARTNER. CAN INTEGRATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS. ACCORDING TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION -- IN THE FIRST ROUND THE TRIAGE GRANTS FIFTY APPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAM FUNDS RECEIPT WERE RECEIVED. ONLY SIX OF THESE PROPOSED PROGRAMS WERE SPECIFIC TO YOU. SO -- WERE LACKING THAT AND ONLY THREE OF THOSE MATTER EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD FOR FUNDING SO. THREE OUT OF FIFTY ACTUALLY -- I'VE GOT FUND. THEREFORE -- THE GRANTS FOR IF YOU CENTER PROGRAMS RECEIVE JUST AVAILABLE TRIAGE FUNDS. SINCE THAT TIME WERE YOU CENTRIC PARTNERSHIPS. HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO THE COMMISSION WERE NOT FUN TO DO THE THE CUT GRANT DOLLARS. AND I THINK THIS -- I'LL I'LL LET -- MY WITNESSES OF TURNOVERS TOTALLY A WEEK AGO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AND LEVINE CARRILLO ASSOCIATE OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WILL ALSO WILL SUPPORT THIS. SENATE BILL WELCOME TO YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES MAKE BETTER CHAIR MEMBERS TOBY YOU IN WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION PRITCHETT OPPORTUNITY HERE. AS THE SENATOR POINTS OUT SOME YEARS AGO WITHIN THE STATE MADE AVAILABLE FUNDING TO COUNTY IS TO INCENTIVIZE IMPROVED WAYS TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. THERE WERE THERE WAS A PRIMARY EMPHASIS ON SERVING ADULTS PARTICULARLY ADULTS WHO YOU SEE EVERY DAY AS HOMELESS ARE INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S AN EXCEPTIONAL PRIORITY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH. SO THE COMMISSION HAS TAKEN STEPS TO BUILD INTO ITS ADMINISTRATIVE THROUGH ITS MINISTRY OF RULES REQUIREMENTS THAT THESE THE FUNDS AT THE STATE MAKES AVAILABLE AS GRANTS TO COUNTIES BE DEDICATED HALF TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND HAVE TWO ADULT OR TO PROGRAMS. AND WITHIN THAT WE DID SPECIFY THAT THAT A PORTION OF THESE FUNDS WOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS WE SEE THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO INCENTIVIZE WAYS THAT SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES CAN WORK TOGETHER AND HAVE. AND MANY OF YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT WE OFTEN FACE CHALLENGES GETTING INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION PARTICULARLY WHEN JURISDICTIONS DON'T OVERLAP WHEN THERE'S COMPETITION FOR LIMITED RESOURCES WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY TRYING TO DO WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THIS ON IS TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO SHAPE. HOW DOLLARS ARE MADE AVAILABLE IN WAYS THAT CAN INCENTIVIZE CROSS COUNTY CROSS SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS? LAST YEAR WE HAVE WE'RE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS BUT THAT THE DEMAND IS TREMENDOUS AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS MAKE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE AND ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO INCENTIVIZE THE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN. APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU.

SADLY TOO MANY STUDENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE NOT GETTING THE EARLY INTERVENTION AND CONTINUED PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT THEY NEED. THIS IS IN PART DUE TO A LACK OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DISTRICTS. EVEN LAW SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN THE SAFEST MOST ACCESSIBLE. AND SITES WHERE STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE SERVICE THIS SERVICES DISCREETLY IN FREE OF SIGMA. BY DIRECTING TRIAGE GRANT FUNDING TOWARDS YOUTH SB FIVE AT EIGHT FIVE EIGHT TWO WILL PLACE A STRONGER FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. SB FIVE A TWO WILL BREAK DOWN SILOS BY ENCOURAGING INCREASED COLLABORATION AMONGST A LIAISON LOCAL PROVIDERS.

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE IN A STATE. PRIVATE SCHOOL PRESCHOOL OR HEAD START OR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ME SAY THAT AGAIN. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE I. E. P. WHETHER THE CHILD IS IN THAT SCHOOL -- THEN THEY DON'T RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING FOR THE SERVICES THERE FOR HAVING TO USE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE THIS NECESSARY SERVICE SB TWO SEVENTEEN WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING. AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO INVEST THE IN THEIR PROGRAMS AND EXPAND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. EARLY INTERVENTION IS CRITICAL FOR STUDENT SUCCESS CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WHO RECEIVE APPROPRIATE SERVICES AT A YOUNG AGE ARE OFTEN ABLE TO GET HELP THEY NEED. AND LEAVE SPEND LEAVE SPEIAL EDUCATION OR NEED LESS INTENSIVE SERVICES AS THEY GET OLDER CALIFORNIA DOES NOT DO ENOUGH TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHICH DETRIMENTALLY A FAX. THIS ALREADY MARGINALIZED GROUP CALIFORNIA MUST LOOK TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IN THE MAINSTREAM QUALITY EDUCATION SETTING. SO THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND SO TODAY I HAVE INVEST SEE FROM THE RIVERSIDE OFFICE OF EDUCATION'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SANDRA BY RARE MARRERO. FROM CSEA TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SIR PORTANTINO WELCOME TO YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS HE INTRODUCED ME MY NAME IS INVEST SEE AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND IS MY PRIVILEGE TODAY TO REPRESENT THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS DR JUDY WHITE. IN EXPRESSING RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICES OF ITS STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. TWO SEVENTEEN INCLUSIVE PROGRAMS ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEARTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. BECAUSE THEY ENSURE STUDENTS WHO HAVE LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITIES HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ALONGSIDE THEIR PEERS. IT IS ABOUT LEADING ALL KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM AND THE SOONER THIS OCCURS THE BETTER. EVERY CHILDHOOD INCLUSIVE PROGRAMS EMBODY THE VALUES AND PRACTICES THAT SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF EVERY YOUNG CHILD. REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO TO PUT PARTICIPATE IN A BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES AS FULL MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES COMMUNITIES AND SOCIETY. FOR MOST PRACTICAL STANDPOINT SB TWO SEVENTEEN WOULD PROVIDE AN ENORMOUS BENEFITS TO SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTS REQUIREMENTS OF ID A APPLY TO ALL CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING CHILDREN FROM AGES. THREE TO FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MANDATED TO CREATE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS ARE CONTRACTS WITH OTHERS TO OFFER THE SERVICES. THE EARLY INTERVENTION GRANT% PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW INCREASE ACCESS FOR DISTRICTS THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER HEAD START OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. IT WOULD ALSO SHOW THE LASTING BENEFITS OF INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOLS AND THEIR INFLUENCE IN SPREADING INCLUSIVE PRACTICES INTO THE LATER GRADES. TO CONCLUDE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED BY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FOCUSING FUNDING ON THESE YOUNG CHILDREN IS AN INVESTMENT THAT WILL PAY DIVIDENDS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES. WE THANK SENATOR PORTANTINO AND SENATOR ROTH FOR INTRODUCING SB TWO SEVENTEEN AND URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE I ON THE BILL. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY.

THE BILL HAS THREE VOTES WILL LEAVE ON CALL FOR OUR OTHER MEMBERS WHEN THEY GET HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ALRIGHT SENATOR PORTANTINO -- FIVE SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING -- PRODUCTIVELY AND COOPERATIVELY WITH MY STAFF -- TODAY I'M HERE ALSO REPRESENT SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD ADDRESS THE MOUNTING CRISIS OF MOUNTING CRISIS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS OF HOMELESSNESS. BY ESTABLISHING A HOUSING RESOURCES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CSU AND CSU TRANCERS OFFICE ANDYOU SEE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. REQUIRING CAMPUSES THAT RECEIVE FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO MAXIMIZE THE FINANCIAL AID RECEIVED BY HOMELESS STUDENTS AND IN SHORT LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY BASED HOUSING RESOURCES. CALIFORNIA'S HAVING A CRISIS IN HOMELESSNESS AMONGST ITS COLLEGE STUDENTS ACCORDING TO A THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANTERS OFFICE OF FULL ONE IN FIVE STUDENTS HAS EXPERIENCED AN EPISODE OF HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS A STUDY OF CALIFORNIA STATE. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FOUND THAT HOMELESS ONE OR MORE TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR AND 5% OF CALIFORNIA YOU SEE STUDENTS ALSO REPORT. EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS SO THIS IS AFFECTING ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS AND FRANKLY ALL OF OUR CHILDREN NOT SURPRISINGLY HOMELESSNESS SERIOUSLY AFFECTS OUR STUDENTS ABILITY TO REMAIN IN SCHOOL AND BE SUCCESSFUL WHAT WE WANT WE WANT OUR KIDS IN CLASS. SUCCEEDING THIS ISSUE OF STUDENT HOMELESSNESS IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE AMONG STUDENTS OF TENDING CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR DORM ACCESS IS LIMITED. OF THE HUNDRED FIFTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA ONLY ELEVEN HAVE DORMS SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WILL AUTHORIZE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. TO COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL HOMELESS SERVICE AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT A COLLEGE FOCUSED RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAM THESE PROGRAMS WOULD PROVIDE HOUSING IDENTIFICATION RENTAL ASSISTANCE IN INTENSIVE CARE MANAGEMENT. TO QUICKLY MOVE STUDENTS FROM HOMELESSNESS INTO HOUSING COUPLED WITH MEANINGFUL SUSTAIN CONNECTIONS TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. COLLEGES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL HOMELESS CONTINUUM OF CARE AND DEVELOP A REFERRAL MECHANISM INTO THEIR COUNTIES COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEMS. FOR HOMELESS SERVICES AND TRAIN STAFF REGARDING ON HOW TO ACCESS -- HOUSING ASSISTANCE IN THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO REVIEW THE FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES OF ALL STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE HOUSING PROGRAM INSURE THAT HOMELESS STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING AID. IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ADOPT POLICIES THAT ENABLE HOMELESS YOUTH TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO pBIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM. STUDENTS LEAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AID THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE TABLE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT COLLECTING CONNECTING THEM TO THAT EIGHT AND I KNOW THE CHAIR SHARES THAT -- ISSUE AS WELL EACH CAMPUS THAT RECEIVES FINDING WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL REPORT WHICH WOULD BE COMPILED AND SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE DETAILING HOW MANY STUDENTS RECEIVE SUPPORT. THE DURATION OF SUPPORT AND THE RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES OF THE PROGRAM SO WE HAVE BUILT IN ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ACTUALLY. HAVING A POSITIVE EFFECT THIS BILL IS -- CALL AGAIN JOINTLY AUTHORED BY SENATOR ROTH AND PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL -- TODAY I HAVE HERE WITH ME -- DEBBIE ROUTE YOUR FROM THE JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH AND ALEXIS BARRIERS A CURRENT STUDENT AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE AND SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY [inaudible] HONORING. A BOOK THAT. YEAH OKAY -- SO ONCE AGAIN I AND EVERY RUSSIA JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR US CONSIDERING THIS BILL. WE KNOW THAT IN TODAY'S ECONOMY A POST SECONDARY CREDENTIAL IS MORE ESSENTIAL THAN EVER BEFORE AND YET THE COLLEGE COMPLETION GAP BETWEEN LOWEST THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS AND THE HIGHEST INCOME STUDENTS HAS GROWN BY 24% IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. WHILE 60% OF WEALTHY STUDENTS COMPLETED AGREED JUST 11% OF POOR STUDENTS. TO CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DISPARITY IS THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS HAVING A CRISIS IN HOMELESSNESS AMONG ITS COLLEGE STUDENTS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHOSE ACADEMIC PROSPECTS ARE ALREADY PRECARIOUS. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS IS EXTREMELY DISPLEASED STABILIZING AND MAKES CALLS COMPLETE COMPLETION PROFOUNDLY UNLIKELY. STUDENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE A KEY CROSSROADS IN THEIR LIFE PATH BY PROVIDING INTERVENTIONS TARGETED TO THE HOMELESS STUDENTS-SUBPOPULATION. THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE SUPPORTED TO MOVE TOWARD SELF SUFFICIENCY ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE AND LIFE SATISFACTION. BY DOING NOTHING WE INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE STUDENTS WILL INSTEAD ENTER THE RANKS OF THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. AN OUTCOME THAT IS NOT ONLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE INDIVIDUAL BUT COSTLY TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN HIGHER EDUCATION DESIGNED TO HELP RETAIN LOW INCOME STUDENTS THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOR STUDENTS TO HELP THEM REGAIN HOUSING STABILITY. THOSE THAT DO EXIST TEND TO OFFER ONLY VERY SHORT TERM EMERGENCY HOUSING OPTIONS RATHER THAN LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. THE MODEL PROPOSED BY S.. BY SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT IS BASED ON A PROVEN FORM OF HOUSING INTERVENTION KNOWN AS RAPIDLY HOUSING AND WILL LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE BUILT ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING PROVIDERS. OVER THE LAST DECADE TO QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS STUDENT HOMELESSNESS. THE STRATEGIES PROPOSED BY SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT OFFER REAL SOLUTIONS USING PROVEN TACTICS THAT WILL ENABLE THIS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE SUBSET OF THE STUDENT POPULATION. TO NOT ONLY X. AND HOMELESSNESS BUT REMAIN ENROLLED IN COLLEGE TO COMPLETE THEIR DESIRED CREDENTIAL AND GO ON TO BE PRODUCTIVE CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR STATE'S ECONOMY HIRED YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB. FIVE SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. I CAN MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ALEXIS BERRIES AND I'M A CURRENT STUDENT I'M HERE TO SHARE ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE BEING HOMELESS DURING THE TIME -- DURING MY TIME AS A COLLEGE STUDENT AND WHY I THINK THE PASSAGE OF FIVE SIXTY EIGHT IS SO IMPORTANT. I SPENT EIGHTEEN YEARS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF BOTH OF MY PARENTS BEING INCARCERATED AND FACING LIFE SENTENCES. MY EARLY YEARS WERE CHALLENGING I WAS CONSTANTLY BEING TOLD YOU'RE GONNA END UP IN PRISON OR DEAD JUST LIKE YOUR PARENTS. FOSTER CARE FOR ME WAS A NUMBER OF FELT PLACEMENTS HAVING TO PACK MY BELONGINGS IN A BLACK TRASH BAG THEY MOVED TO ANOTHER PLACE OFTENTIMES SEVERAL COUNTIES AWAY. EACH TIME I MOVED I WAS FORCED TO CHANGE SCHOOLS WHICH LEFT ME FAR BEHIND ACADEMICALLY. NONE THE LESS I LOVE SCHOOL ALTHOUGH NOT FOR THE REASON MOST IT. FOR ME SCHOOL WASN'T OUTLET TO ESCAPE THE PHYSICAL ABUSE THAT I ADORED BY THOSE WHOSE JOB IT WAS TO PROTECT ME. AS I APPROACH HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO BE ABLE TO PROVE TO MYSELF THAT I COULD DO IT. BY THE GRACE OF GOD I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN AND FILL MY DREAM OF BECOMING A COLLEGE STUDENT. THAT DREAM HOWEVER. THE DREAM HOWEVER AGAINST REALITY IT WAS AGAINST REALITY WHEN I TURNED EIGHTEEN I FOUND MYSELF WITH NO PLACE TO LIVE. AS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WITH NO SAVINGS NO CREDIT HISTORY AND NO ADULT SUPPORT FOR ME TO FIND HOUSING I FOUND MYSELF HOMELESS. I SPENT THREE MONTHS SLEEPING IN MY CAR WHILE ALSO TRYING TO STAY ENROLLED IN COLLEGE FINDING PERMANENT HOUSING AND WORKING FULL TIME AT PETE'S COFFEE AND TEA AND FARMERS INSURANCE. BEING HOMELESS WAS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL AND SCARY I WANTED TO FIND A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD TO PARK MY CAR OVERNIGHT BUT THAT MEANT HAVING TO CONSTANTLY MOVE MY CAR TO AVOID BEING HARASSED BY POLICE. I WOULD SHOWER IN THE BATHROOM AT WORK AND I DON'T TELL ANYONE THAT I WAS HOMELESS BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE THE NEGATIVE STIGMA AND THE CONCERN OF ME LOSING MY JOB. THROW ALL THIS I WAS ATTENDING SANTA ROSA JUNIOR COLLEGE WHEN I FIRST ATTENDED COLLEGE I WAS HOUSE TO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND I DID WELL. BUT WHEN I BECAME HOMELESS I STARTED TO FEEL MY CLASSES. MY TIME HOMELESS ENDED UP SENDING ME BACK YEARS. AT AND I LOST ALL MY FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE OF MY POOR GPA WHICH THEN FURTHER DELAY MY ABILITY TO GET BACK ON TRACK WITH MY STUDIES. I THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY ON TRACK WITH MY COLLEGE COURSES AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE FURTHER ALONG AT THIS POINT IN MY EDUCATIONAL CAREER THAN I AM NOW. I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I WAS A RESOURCEFUL PERSON AND I SAVE MONEY FOR MY WORK DURING THE TIME THAT LIVED IN MY CAR -- EVENTUALLY I FOUND A I FOUND A LANDLORD WHO WAS SYMPATHETIC TO MY SITUATION AND WAS GOING TO WRITE WITH ME. I'M KNOWN ROLES IN THE PAST WITH A LAW PROGRAM AT SAN JOAQUIN DELTA COLLEGE BUT NOW BUT MANY OTHERS ARE NOT AS FORTUNATE AS I AM. AND THEY HAVE TO GIVE UP ON THEIR STUDIES ENTIRELY FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WILL HELP MANY OF THESE STUDENTS TO STAY ON TRACK AND NOT SUFFER THE KIND OF CHALLENGES THAT I FACE. SO WITH THAT I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR FIVE SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I'M GONNA ASK THE AUDIENCE TO BE RESPECTFUL OF FOLKS THAT ARE TESTIFYING. IF YOU WANT HAVE A CONVERSATION IF YOU'D STEP OUTSIDE THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO LITTLE OUT OF HERE. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE HI MY NAME IS ELIZABETH MORE AND I'M A CURRENT STUDENT VIEW COLLEGE AND I AM IN FAVOR OF THIS -- I MYSELF WAS HOMES FOR OVER FIVE YEARS AND THE SECOND TIME I BECAME ALMOST ACTUALLY HAD TO DROP OUT OF COLLEGE.

THANK YOU SIR CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM SEVEN SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA WILK HI WILK I CHIANG WHO WRESTLE. WITH US SO I GLAZER MCGUIRE CAN. THOSE TWO ZERO SO YOU'RE OFF TO A FAST START AND WE WILL HOLD THAT OPEN FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBER [inaudible] THE RECOMMENDATION. OKAY UP NEXT IS GOING TO BE ITEM FIFTEEN SB SEVEN TO NINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION TO PASS AND SEND TO A PROBES SO SEN SENATOR FORTINO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU -- MISTER VICE CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES -- TODAY I AM PRESENTING SB -- SEVEN TWENTY NINE EXISTING LOST OUT WHICH IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCING SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES STATE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO BE CALCULATED PURSUANT. TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA LC FF AS IT IS COMMONLY CALLED. EXISTING LAW SPECIFIES THE AMOUNT OF THE BASS GRANT -- IN THE 200-013-2000 FOURTEEN YEAR AS PROVIDED AND REQUIRES THAT AMOUNT TO BE INCREASED BY A SPECIFIC SPECIFIED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. NOT WITHSTANDING THE SPECIFIED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT SB SEVEN TWENTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE THE AMOUNT OF THE BASS GRANT FOR THE 200-019-2000 TWENTY FISCAL YEAR. TO BE INCREASED BY A FIVE POINT ONE SIX COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. THE TOTAL IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS IMPLEMENTED -- IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN PLACING FUNDING DECISIONS IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL DISTRICTS SO THAT THEY COULD MORE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED NEEDS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE LC AFFECT PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ALLEY ETS SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO SPEND THEIR STATE FUNDING. THE FUNDING STRUCTURE OF LCF IS DIVIDED INTO BASS SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS ARE DESIGNED FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOST YOU THEN STUDENTS THAT COME FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE LONG STRESSED THAT THE BASE FUNDING LEVEL IN THE LCI PFAFF WAS SET TO LOW FROM THE OUTSET AND I AGREE. STRONGLY WITH THAT. OPINION THIS PROPOSAL IS AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE THE BASE FUNDING LEVEL FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND BECOME PART OF A PERMANENT PART OF THE FUNDING FORMULA MOVING FORWARD. THE FUNDING WILL HELP LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH COST PRESSURES -- AND EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THAT ARE FACING RISING OPTIONAL COSTS -- AND ALSO FIXED COSTS RETIREMENT COSTS HEALTHCARE AND AS WE'VE HEARD SPECIAL EDUCATION. FRANKLY I DON'T THINK ANYONE ARGUED WITH THE IDEA OF TRYING TO CREATE MORE OF A LOCAL FUNDING FORMULA. AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ARGUED WITH CREATING A PROGRAM THAT GAVE MORE FUNDS TO DISTRICTS THAT HAD CERTAIN NEEDS WHERE THE ARGUMENT CAME IS THE BASE FUNDING WAS SET. TO LOW EVEN TODAY WHEN WE CELEBRATE FULL FUNDING OF LCF PFAFF. WHEN YOU ADJUST FOR INFLATION OR NOT AT TWO THOUSAND SEVENS FUNDING LEVEL SO LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN WERE CLAIMING VICTORY WHEN-IT'S A HALF FACTORY YOU KNOW I'M PROUD THAT WE'VE INCREASED FUNDING? BUT THE BASE WAS JUST SET TO LOW AND DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE ARE FACING THAT CRUNCH IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND IN DIFFERENT MANNERS BUT MANY OF THEM IF NOT ALL OF THEM NEED AN INCREASE FUNDING LEVEL AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. EDUCATION FUNDING WE TALK ABOUT OUR KIDS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US ALWAYS STARTS WITH IT'S A PRIORITY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS GENERATION HAS THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION. BUT IT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO PRIORITIZING. WE DON'T OFTEN FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO DO A MINOR ADJUSTMENT THAT WOULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE WE WERE APPRECIATIVE OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S -- QUICK MOVEMENT TO FULLY FUND THE LC A FAST BUT JUST TO CENTER PORTANTINO STATED IT IS IN NO WAY ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS OUR SCHOOLS ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS TO MEET THE MULTITUDE OF NEEDS -- THAT OUR CHILDREN HAVE TO BRING THEM INTO THE NEXT COMPETITIVE CENTURY SO WE DO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT MOVING AS FOR THANK YOU.

SO SENATOR YOU HAVE TO AYE VOTES IT WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU. I KNOW THERE'S MANY COMMITTEES THIS MORNING [inaudible] AND WE'VE. HAVE CALLS OUT TO AUTHORS SO WE'RE GONNA SHUT DOWN UNTIL SOMEBODY SHOWS UP WELCOME CONGRESSMAN MY CASKEY. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ITEM TEN SB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE AND THE RECOMMENDATION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO PROCREATION THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY STATING THAT I WILL. ACCEPT. OR WILL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. NOW SB. FIVE EIGHT FIVE DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A PLAN FOR TRANSITIONING NON UNIFIED. SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I COME AT THIS AS A BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZE OR SO I LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY VERSES AND THAT PER SE EDUCATION APPROACH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HAVE BEEN A STATE. IN THE STATE AND LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY FOR OVER SEVENTY YEARS EXAMPLES OF PREVIOUS ACTIONS INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BUREAU SCHOOL DISTRICTS ORGANIZATION BUT A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT AVERAGE EDUCATION IN. NINETEEN FORTY NINE MAJOR LEGISLATION IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR BY DENSE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER CHESS ANDREW -- WHICH OFFERED NEW INCENTIVES FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT UNIFIED AND DISINCENTIVES. FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT IT SETS STANDARDS REGARDING DISTRICTS SIZE AND PHYSICAL ABILITY TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS. AND AS THE RECENTLY AS NINETEEN NINETY NINE JUST A MERE TWENTY YEARS AGO A RESOLUTION BY SENATOR -- DEDE ALPERT WHO'S THE FORMER CHAIR OF THIS VERY COMMITTEE CREATING A NEW MASTER PLAN FOR EDUCATION WHICH PUSH FOR UNIFICATION OF ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL -- CONTROL FORMULA FINANCIAL INCENTIVES CREATED BY MOST OF THE LEGISLATION THAT ENCOURAGING OF CATION ARE NO LONGER IN PLACE. SO UNIFICATION OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAS ALREADY SHOWN WITH. HAS ALREADY SLOWED. WITH THE LACK OF A CONTINUE FISCAL FISCAL INCENTIVES -- IT'S DOUBTFUL THAT MANY OR ANY DISTRICTS WILL PUSH PURSUE UNIFICATION AT THIS TIME EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE. THE COMMON CORE. ACT -- CURRICULUM AND NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS WHICH WHICH DEMAND REQUIRE A CONTINUUM OF OF ACADEMIC. UNDERSTANDING AT EACH GRADE LEVEL AS WE GO THROUGH THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM UNIFIED'S DISTRICTS PROVIDE MANY BENEFITS FOR STUDENTS. AND THE COMMUNITY STEPPED THE STE SERVE FINANCIALLY. IN FACT DISTRICTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO POOL RESOURCES REDUCE OPERATION ALL COSTS AND PROVIDE FOR A SINGLE STREAMLINED ADMINISTRATION THE CHEAPER FISSION SEES OF SCALE WE ALL DESIRE HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL. THESE TYPES OF COST SAVINGS ALLOW FOR MORE FUNDS TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE CLASSROOM WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS TO DELIVER ENHANCE EDUCATIONAL OFFERING TO STUDENTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT PROVIDES STUDENTS. A COORDINATING. MATRICULATION THAT IS SUPPORTED AND BUILT UPON THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE. K. TWELVE SYSTEM EXPERIENCE. MANY OF YOU KNOW MY WIFE IS GETTING A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN EDUCATION SHE TALKS ABOUT. THIS OBSESSIVELY ALL THE TIME ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AT THESE DIFFERENT GRADE LEVELS CAN HOW THERE'S PUSH BACK -- FOR COMMON CORE STILL TODAY AND AND NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS EVEN THOUGH ALL THE MATERIAL AND HER THESIS WILL FOCUS ON THIS. POINTS OUT THAT IT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN SIMPLE WROTE MEMORY IS A THING OF THE PAST ALTHOUGH I'M VERY GOOD AT REAL MEMOR. AS NOTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS MISTER VICE CHAIR THERE ARE ISSUES OF INSTRUCTIONAL MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND STUDENTS TRANSITION INTO THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SENATEBILL FIVE EIGHT FIVE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN PROVIDING OUR STUDENTS WITH. WHICH SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT OPERATE IN THE MOST COORDINATED EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE WAY POSSIBLE. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS PERTINENT TO ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. INCLUDING MINE. AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MICHELLE REAVIS WHOSE THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE TWIN RIVERS. A SCHOOL BOARD OF TRUSTEES THANK YOU SENATOR MISTER VICE CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBER THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME OFF A LITTLE BIT THE YOU'RE SITTING THERE NOW I KNOW YOU SOMETHING ELSE I FORGOT YOUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WELL YEAH I DON'T GET TO WEAR MY SCHOOL BOARD HAD VERY OFTEN IN THIS BUILDING SO I I REALLY. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. SO IT'S A SENATOR STATED ON THE VICE PRESIDENT THE TWIN RIVERS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS THE RESULT OF THE UNIFICATION OF FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I WAS A PART OF THOSE EFFORTS IT TOOK OVER TEN YEARS TO MAKE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT REALITY MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE TO CONSIDER UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS A VERY EMOTIONAL ISSUE FOR A LOT OF FOLKS AND THE REALITY IS THAT YOU'RE WORKING TO PUT YOURSELF. OUT OF A JOB AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET TRUSTEES TO AGREE TO DO THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET SCHOOL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS TO AGREE TO DO THAT. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS UNIFICATION IS BEST FOR KIDS AND EDUCATION THEIR PROVIDES FOR OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU MAY NOT HAPPEN TO DISTRICT THAT ISN'T UNIFIED. IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TEACHERS TO WORK TOGETHER SO THAT THEY CAN HELP THOSE KIDS MOVE FROM. FROM THE VARIOUS GRADE LEVELS AND FROM ELEMENTARY TO SECONDARY EDUCATION SO FROM A STRICTLY EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. AGAIN UNIFICATION IS INCREDIBLY BENEFICIAL TO KIDS AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BELL AGAIN IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GO -- TO THROUGH IF IT'S DONE BY A VERY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHOUT THIS KIND OF GUIDANCE AND AGAIN IT'S IT'S REALLY A BENEFIT TO STUDENTS IN THE STATE SOME. HAPPY TO BE HERE SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ANYONE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. BY STAFF -- IT DOES YOUR STAFF OKAY PORTS BILL THANK YOU SHE ARE YOU SURE I LIKE HER SPEAK HONOR ON BEHALF -- ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OKAY YOU JUST LEAVING OKAY MOVING STE CHAIRS OKAY DON'T MESS WITH ME. I KNOW YOU ARE NOW [inaudible] IN OPPOSITION. SEE NOW IS A PULL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- JUST IS THERE A QUICK WAY OF DESCRIBING. THE PROCESS IN. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHICH SCHOOLS OR WHAT THE MERGER. I THINK I'M USING THE TERM pMERGER SORRY -- WOULD WOULD BE LIKE I THINK THE WORD WHAT I ENVISION IS A DISPASSIONATE. REVIEW OF OF OF OF THE DAY WELL THAT'S WHY WE'RE STARTING OFF WITH HAVING CD HE COME UP WITH THE PLAN BECAUSE WE SAT DOWN AND SAID HERE. PTA. AND TEACHERS AND EVERYBODY COME IN AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK WE'VE TRIED THAT FOR FIFTY YEARS THAT'S THAT'S MY COULD WORK WITH THE PLAN HERE IS THAT WE GO BACK WE LOOK AT REMEMBER WE'RE NOT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- I HAVE TO BE UNIFORM I DON'T I WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S NOT ALL THE SAME SIZE AS A MATTER KIDS IS JUST UNIFIED AND LOOK AT THE LOOK AT THE AREA AND FIND OUT YOU KNOW SOME. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SO THEIR OWN SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT'S AN EASY THAT'S SAN JOSE AND I'VE GOT. I'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT HE DOES OKAY SO WE GET THAT BUT OTHERS ARE LOOKING AT YOU LOOK AT THE GEOGRAPHY AND FINCH TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS. DISPASSIONATELY WHAT MAKES SENSE TO TO HAVE THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT SEE YOU HAVE A AT JUST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT MAYBE IT WORKS IF YOU MOVE FROM ALL OVER HERE TO THIS HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU SPIN OFF ONE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL SO IT. IT WORKS OFF AND IT IT'S IN THE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT OR MAYBE YOU PLUG THEM INTO THE ADJOINING DISTRICTS OR MAYBE YOU BRING A HIGH SCHOOL. OUT OF A UNIFIED HOUSE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN AND JUST MAKE A DISTRICT ON ITS OWN SO THERE'S A THERE'S DIFFERENT. POSSIBILITIES BUT AGAIN WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THEM WOULD LIKE TO HAVE TO DISPATCH. THIS PASSIONATE. DRAWING A LINE SINCE SUGGESTION AND THEN THE VIGOROUS IN -- A HEALTHY DEBATE THAT GOES ON WITH THAT AND I THINK IT IS NOT THAT THAT THIS IS THE ONE LINE THAT ENDS IT BUT BUT WE'D LIKE TO AT LEAST HAVE THE MECHANISMS WHY WE THINK IT. IT WOULD ALLOW FOR BETTER OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS AND WE ALREADY HAVE A REQUIREMENT ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT I MEAN I THINK I CAN SEE A LOT OF THIS SAYING WE'RE GOOD THIS IS A HEALTHY. COMMUNITY. WE'RE GOING TO ADD THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD TAX BASE YOU DO THIS IN AND WE'RE GOING TO DEMAND THAT YOU BRING IT UP TO PERFORMANCE WHICH IS I THINK IT'S A GOOD [inaudible] DISPASSIONATE [inaudible] RESOLUTION [inaudible] THE BILL. GREAT OUT SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION. I THINK WE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS SO I HAVE THREE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN MY ONE REGION WHERE I LIVE. WE HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS QUITE LARGE AND WE HAVE FOUR VERY SMALL. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. ISSUES IS JOB DUPLICATION OF SERVICES -- SO THE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT DID A STUDY LIKE TWELVE YEARS AGO MISSION THERE WERE SAVE AT LEAST FOURTEEN MILLION A YEAR -- BUT PEOPLE VIEWED IT AS A AS A POWER GRAB SO I WAS SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS I'M GONNA BRING YOU DOWN TO ME AND MY CONSTITUENTS WHEN THEY START -- YEAH MOVIE BE UNIFIED A BRING MY PIN YADA [inaudible] THERE'S THERE'S A SLOW UP A SLUG OF A REPORTS IN A ONE NUMBER BEING BANTER AROUND THIS IS UNITED STATES.

IT'S A SUPERINTENDENT WHO -- DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THAT JOB THEY'RE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIRING AND FIRING BUT AND IT COULD MAKING SURE YOUR CREDENTIALS ARE ARE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED ALSO.

I AM PRESENTING TODAY AS BE SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN WHICH WOULD IMPROVE THE PERCENTAGE OF COMMUNITYCOLLEGE INSTRUCTIONS TAUGHT BY A FULL TIME FACULTY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE WHICH REFORM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. MISSION AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND STATING THE IMPORTANCE OF FULL TIME FACULTY IT ALSO ESTABLISHED A GOAL THAT 75% OF INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE TAUGHT BY A FULL TIME FACULTY. IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS. WHEN I SAY TO GET MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS SINCE THE STATE ADOPTED THIS GOAL OF 75% AND IT HAS YET TO BE ACHIEVED? IN FACT DUE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES GROWING OVER RELIANCE ON TEMPORARY PART TIME FACULTY THE LATEST DATA SHOWS THE FULL TIME FACULTY TEACHING LEVEL AT ONLY FIFTY SIX POINT 7%. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT COUNTS FOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONVENE TO WORK GROUP MADE UP OF COLLEGE ADMINISTRATORS. AND FACULTY TO EXPLORE OPTIONS TO REFORM TO KEY LAWS AND REGULATIONS THE 75% GOAL AND THE I ALREADY EXPLAINED WHAT THE 75% GOAL IS A THE 50% LAW BASICALLY STATES THAT 50% OF COLLEGE FUNDING IS SPENT ON INSTRUCTION. THE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN CONCERT IN MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE WORKGROUP REPORTED RECOMMENDATIONS TO ACHIEVE THE THE WORKER ALSO HOPE TO COME UP WITH A RECOMMENDATION TO THE 50% LAW -- BUT NO FORTY THEY'RE NOT THERE YET BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY DATA FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO PROPERTY DISCUSS POSSBLE REFORMS. I REALIZE SOME OF IF YOU WOULD-PREFER A FULL PACKAGE AS TO WHY -- BUT WE NEED MEANING. I'M SORRY REALIZE THAT SOME OF YOU WOULD PREFER THE FULL PACKAGE BUT ANY REFORM PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANY 5% GOAL. AT THIS IS CALLED THE FUN FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER AND THE 50% LAW INCLUDED IN THIS BILL -- BUT THIS BILL IS MEANT TO INCORPORATE ONLY THOSE REFORMS AGREED UPON BY THE WORK GROUP ALREADY NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS. OF THE WORKER DOES COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO AMEND THE BILL TO INCORPORATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AS WELL I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE BILL. ONE IS A CONCERN THAT THIS BILL WHICH SHOULD. ONLY BE ADOPTED UNLESS IT COMES WITH MORE FUNDING BECAUSE FULL TIME FACULTY COSTS MORE I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE INCREASES IN COST IS NOT. FOR FULL COST OF FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBER BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER ALREADY EMPLOYED AND A FULL TIME. EMPLOYEE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE ALREADY PAYING PART TIME FACULTY I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE STATE NOT ONLY GAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THEIR USE OF FUNDS BUT IT ALSO INCREASE THE FUNDING NO DOUBT I WILL BE AN ARDENT SUPPORTER MOVING FORWARD FOR FIGHTING FOR MORE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT AT THIS POINT COLLEGES ARE WAY BETTER OFF THAN THEY WERE A FEW YEARS AGO SO IF NOT NOW WHEN AND AGAIN THIRTY YEARS. ANOTHER CONCERN I HEARD IS THIS BILL IS PREMATURE BECAUSE THE CHANCELLOR. THE CHANCES CONSULTATION COUNCIL HAS YET TO MEET AND REVIEW THE WORK GROUPS OF RECOMMENDATIONS MEMBERS THIS RECOMMENDATIONS WERE PROPOSED OVER A YEAR AGO THE COUNCIL MEETS FREQUENTLY. AND I IMAGINE IT WOULD HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS AND HOW TIME. TO TO DISCUSS SOUL TO ASK FOR THE BILL TO WAIT FOR THE COUNCIL AND THEN THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TO MEET IS TO ESSENTIALLY ASKED FOR THE BILL TO DYING COMMITTEE. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I ASKED THAT WE MOVE THE BILL TODAY THE BILL IS NOT NEEDED IN THE END THAT'S OKAY BUT AT LEAST WE ENSURE WE DO NOT TO LATE YET ANOTHER YEAR. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WAS FIRST. MY FIRST ACCESS TO A TO A HIGHER EDUCATION AS A FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT FULL TIME FACULTY ARE AND HOW MUCH WE NEED THEM IF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE GOING TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. AT OVER 43% OF LATINOS COMPRISE THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE NEXT LARGEST GROUP IS WHITE AT 26% IN GENERAL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS THE LARGEST. MOST IMPORTANT POP PIPELINE TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STATE. LATINO POPULATION ACCORDING TO TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT BY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER LATINOS HAVE MADE INROADS IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COLLEGE ENROLLMENT BUT TRY STICKY LACK BEHIND AND COLLEGE COMPLETION. DATA FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN SHOW THAT ONLY 15% OF LATINOS AGE TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD HAD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR MORE COMPARED 263% OF ASIANS 41% WHITES AND 22% BLACKS. THIS TREND IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING GIVEN THAT LATINOS ARE NOW THE LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP IN CALIFORNIA. THE SIMPLE FACT THE FULL TIME FACULTY CAN HOLD OFFICE HOURS HIGHLIGHTS HOW. HAVING STABLE EXPERIENCE AND ACCESSIBLE FACULTY IS SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FOR STUDENT OUTCOMES BECAUSE THE ECONOMY. I'M SORRY BECAUSE ECONOMY ECONOMIC FATE AND PROSPERITY OF THE STATE WILL LIKELY REST ON THE EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS OFFER USE. AND FUTURE STUDENTS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES WHAT IT CAN TO INCREASE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES I COMMUNITY COLLEGES INCREASING THE RATE OF INSTRUCTION BY FULL TIME FACULTY IS CRITICAL TO REACHING THIS GOAL WITHOUT CHANGING HOW OUR STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT IT IS DOUBTFUL. WE ARE THE TOP OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS WILL EVER BE REALIZED SO TODAY I'M HONORED TO HAVE RECOUNTS AN AMOROUS MATH FACULTY AT DE ANZA COLLEGE. A PAST PRESIDENT OF EIGHT ACC A MEMBER OF THE WORKGROUP THAT WORKED ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL AS DAVID BELL HAWKINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE INDEPENDENCE BONTA THE BILL THANK YOU GENTLEMEN FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO WELCOME GENTLEMEN YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU CENTER AT YOUR LEYVA A VICE CHAIR WILL DAVID BELL HAWKINS WITH THE COMMITTEE KHALEEJ INDEPENDENCE -- YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT MY TEST FOR THIS MORNING AND THEN I CHANGED EVERYTHING -- BECAUSE I'VE BEEN -- ACCUSED ORGANIZATION FINNICK USE OF DOING SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT EVER INTENDING TO DO. SO FROM THE BEGINNING ALL THAT WE WANTED TO DO WITH THIS BILL WAS TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS SAID HAD UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT. INCLUDING FROM TWO CHANCELLORS AN EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY AND AS SUPERINTENDENT PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO DO THIS BILL THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED WITH SENATOR RUBIO ABOUT -- PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY WERE PREMATURE -- BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE ONE PIECE IN THE BILL THAT IS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT WE DO HAVE AGREEMENT ON THE 50% LAW ON A POLICY BASIS THAT'S ALSO IN THE REPORT. WE DON'T HAVE IT IS A NEW PERCENTAGE NUMBER. THREE YEARS AGO WE ASK FOR DATA FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE ONCE WE FOLD IN FOR INSTANCE THE CHANGE WOULD BE PRIMARILY FOLDING IN CANCERS AND LIBRARIANS IN THAT INSTRUCTIONAL. PERCENTAGE. SO WE'RE EXPANDING THE PART OF WE STATE 50% THAT WE'RE GONNA BE. KNOCKING PEOPLE OUT SO IT'S PROBABLY FIFTY THREE MAYBE 54% IS THE NEW PERCENTAGE. BUT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T GAS AND THAT FOR THREE YEARS WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR DAD AND WE HAVEN'T HAD THE DATA SO UNTIL WE GET THE DATA BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO PUT IT IN THE BILL SO. I'VE GOT LABOR UNIONS ASKING ME FOR AMENDMENTS AND I'M TELLING THEM NO BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE REPORT [inaudible] SO. I'VE BEEN AROUND HERE A LONG TIME. ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY HAVE NEVER BEEN NEVER AGREED ON THESE ISSUES. I HAVE NEVER AGREED ON THIS LEASES ALL THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN CONTENTIOUS SO WHEN AND EVERY TO GIVE THE DETAILS WHEN I HEARD THAT THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT AYE I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT'S THAT'S INCREDIBLE. WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY IT MOVE ALONG WITH FULL TIME FACT WHICH IS GOING BACKWARDS BY THE WAY. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE LOST CLOSE TO THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS OUT WEIRD 56% NOW WE SHOULD BE AROUND FIFTY NINE BUT THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO -- AND WE DIDN'T WANT THIS TO SIT ON A SHELF -- AGAIN IT'S BEEN IN THE FIELD FOR THREE YEARS THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF TIME FOR THE CANCERS OFFICE -- TO ACT ON THIS AND SO WE JUST SAID WELL. YOU KNOW CENTER RUBIO CAN YOU CAN YOU TRUST US TO GET THIS THROUGH JUST LIKE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO -- WILL REFLECT WHATEVER THE THE WORK THAT WORK FORCE RECOMMENDATION IS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON SO -- BUT A COUPLE OF QUICK PIECES SO JUNE TWO THOUSAND FIVE YOU ARE USING UP YOUR CAR COLLEAGUES TIME THEN I'M DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATED [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I CAN PICK UP FROM RIGHT THERE BECAUSE I SERVED ON THAT TASK FORCE AS WELL IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND THEN I WAS INVOLVED IN ALL OF THE WORK GROUP -- SESSIONS -- IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE ACTUALLY WE WERE AT THAT POINT COMING OFF ABOUT A TEN YEAR PERIOD WHERE OUR PERCENTAGE. HOVERED AROUND 63% ACTUALLY SO WE'VE ACTED AND WHEN WE ENTERED INTO A RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO YEARS LATER. THAT'S WHEN THOSE NUMBERS THAT DAVID LISTED THAT BECAME OPERATIVE WE DROP DOWN BELOW SIXTY AND NOW WE'RE DOWN AROUND -- FIFTY SEVEN I THINK IT'S THE DYNAMICS OF THE CUTS AND THINGS THAT HAPPENED DURING THOSE THOSE YEARS BUT IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT -- WOULD BE THE CASE -- ONE THING I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD TO THIS IS THAT THIS WHOLE WORKGROUP CAME OUT OF WHAT WAS CALLED. THE SACRED COWS WORKSHOPS. THEY WERE PRESENTED BY AND THEN THE SACRED COWS ARE THE 50% LAW AND THE 75% GOAL -- THE IT WAS A GROUP OF ONE ACADEMIC SENATE -- PERSON THE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME -- BUSINESS OFFICER AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM THE SYSTEM AND THEY HAD OPEN MEETINGS WHERE THEY DISCUSSED THESE -- PROBLEMS. I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A MATTER OF AGREEMENT OR NOT BUT WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE 75% GOAL AND WE ALSO HAVE THE 50% LAW. THAT -- SETS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE DISTRICTS IN TERMS OF THEIR SPENDING. AND CENTER LATE -- SENATOR RUBIO PUT IT RIGHT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION. BUT AS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN REFORMED MIGHTILY WE'VE GOT NEW MONEY TO ACTUALLY FIND LEASE -- FUND OUR STUDENTS SERVICES SUPPORT OF FOR STUDENT SUCCESS THAT'S A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH -- WE WERE ALWAYS PAID SIMPLY FOR STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS LIKE A TWELVE IS EIGHTY A FOR US FOR US IT WAS ALSO ATTENDANCE. NOW WE'RE FINALLY OVER THAT HURDLE THIS IS THE TIME TO COME TOGETHER THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME POTENTIAL TO HAVE THESE TWO ISSUES ADDRESSED -- BRING THE STUDENTS SERVICE SIDE INTO TE 50% LAW TO SOME LIMITED EXTENT. WE NEED THE DATA ON NOT TO BE ABLE TO SET THAT NEW NUMBER. AND THEN ALSO TO INSTITUTE A MEANS OF GETTING THE FULL TIME FACULTY WE NEED. AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT INSTRUCTIONS ALL THE OTHER WORK THAT GOES INTO STUDENT SUCCESS. GUIDED PATHWAYS REQUIRES A LOT MORE FACULTY MENTORING. THAT'S HOW WE NEED FULL TIME FACULTY TO DO THAT WORK SO THE THE IT'S A NEXUS PERFECT TIME WE CAN REALLY MAKE BIG CHANGES HERE THAT WILL BE BENEFIT TO ALL OUR STUDENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. SEVEN A GOLDEN OF THE FACULTY-ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEN MEN'S ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. COME ON DOWN. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS RYAN MACLAINE AND I'M WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE A CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB -- SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN FIRST TO BE CLEAR -- WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS THIS MEASURE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FULL TIME FACULTY -- THE AUTHOR I THINK I'LL ELEGANTLY TALKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF FULL TIME FACULTY IN THE CLASSROOM. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE ASPIRATIONAL GOAL THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS OF HAVING 75% OF OUR COURSE INSTRUCTION TAUGHT BY FULL TIME FACULTY. HOWEVER. WHEN THE GOAL WAS SAID? IT WAS INTENDED THAT WE RECEIVE PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENT FUNDING SO THAT WE COULD RECYCLE. WE DID WE DID RECEIVE SOME FUNDING FOR A FEW YEARS BUT SINCE THEN -- DUE TO RECESSIONS -- ARE FUNDING REALLY ESTATE FLAT ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION EXCUSE ME. UNFORTUNATELY AS THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WITH THE LOWEST PER PEOPLE FUNDING RATE -- IN THE STATE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. COMPARED TO TWELVE THOUSAND K. TWELVE SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN AND CSU AND TWENTY SEVEN AND YOU SEE. OUR INSTITUTIONS MUST MAKE HARD CHOICES ABOUT -- HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT LOCAL PRIORITIES -- IT'S A PRIORITIES. AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE OUR FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBERS -- THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THIS REPORT -- WHICH FIVE DISTRIBUTOR **** STARTIN TO DISTRIBUTE -- TO MEMBERS ON THE DíAS -- AND WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN SB SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN AND WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE REPORT -- SO FIRST IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A OMMITMENT TO INCLUDE ONCE WE GET DATA AVAILABLE TO INCLUDE RE BENCHING OF A 50% LAW AND BUT LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS FOR THAT -- HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT ARE JUST NOT INCLUDED. FOR EXAMPLE -- THE REPORT -- HASN'T ASKED THAT A SYSTEM CONSENSUS FORM AROUND THE BILL OR BEFORE AROUND THE REPORT. BEFORE ANY OF THE INITIATIVES ARE IMPLEMENTED -- THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. AND THEN FINALLY THROUGHOUT THE REPORT THERE'S BEEN STRONG ADVOCACY FOR FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL OR THE REPORT -- AND AGAIN WE JUST DO NOT SEE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING COMING TO HELP US IMPLEMENT -- THE TENETS OF THIS REPORT SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE HOLD THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AWESOME WEBSTER ON BEHALF OF THE COAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT RANCHO SANTIAGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND ORANGE COUNTY LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE. WE HAVEN'T. SUBMITTED ANY FORMAL OPPOSITION BUT WE DO STRONGLY SHARE THE CONCERNS -- OUTLINED BY OUR COLLEAGUE AT THE LEAGUE -- AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION THAT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION SEEING AND HEARING THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENATOR WILK I HAVE A COMMENT I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING ON THIS ISSUE IS A FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- TRUSTEE FOR SIX YEARS AND I KNOW THE TO LIKE THE 50% LAW WAS PASSED THE YEAR I WAS BORN. AND NEED TO DRESS I TRY TO DO THAT MY MY FRESHMAN YEAR UP HERE IN CUT CHEWED UP. I APPRECIATE YOUR BRAVERY -- TODAY I'M I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORT OF THE BILL I HAD TO MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES REACHED OUT IN AN INNER OPPOSITION I'M COMPANY YOU ARE GOING TO GET IT OUT. AND HOPEFULLY WE CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND WE CAN GET TO SEE -- SOMETHING THAT BENEFITS ALL STUDENTS SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR WILK CENTER PAN. THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSER TO RUBIO YES THANK YOU. WELL THIS BILL IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS AND GIVING OUR TEACHER STABILITY AND I MEAN I KNOW EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT THE SAME I EQUATE THIS TO BE A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER WHICH I DID FOR TWO YEARS YOU BOUNCE AROUND AND NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD. A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STUDENTS THAT YOU SERVICE AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I BECAME A FULL TIME TEACHER THAT YOU START GETTING MORE VESTED IN THE IN THE STUDENTS PERSONALIZING GOING BEYOND THE SCOPE OF YOUR JOB AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE THIS BILL DOES. THAT WE GET OUR TEACHERS MORE INVESTED AND BECOME MENTORS AT SOMEONE MENTION OF FALLOUT FOR OUR LONG TERM SUCCESS STATE CAN I URGE YOUR RIFLE. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO THE BILL'S REMOVED BY SENATOR PAN MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM SEVENTEEN SB SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. LEYVA AYE WILK NO WILK NO CHIANG WHO ASSELIN. Là ASSEGAI GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN. PAN HI. WILL BE THERE ON CALL FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR RUBIO SANDERS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I THINK I SEE CENTER BRADFORD COME ON DOWN. CENTER BRADFORD I THINK YOU HAVE SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE WHENEVER YOU ARE READY PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT. SB FIVE SEVEN FIVE NO SOME MEN DAHLE OFTEN STATED THE BEST WEAPON FOR CHANGING THE WORLD IS A GREAT EDUCATION. AND WE OFTEN STATE THAT EDUCATION IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER -- BUT WE MUST ASK OURSELVES FOR HOME. WE MUST ALSO OUT FOR SHOWS IF WE'RE TRULY IF WE TRULY VALUE EVERY STUDENT EVEN STUDENTS WHO HAPPEN TO BE INCARCERATED AS POLISHED AND POLICY MAKERS THAT ANSWER SHOULD BE YES. AND OF DANCERS YES WE MUST AGAIN ASKS WHY. THERE ARE BANDS ON CAL GRANT FOR THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED INCARCERATION SHOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFY STUDENTS FROM CAL GRANT PROGRAMS AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE PRESENTING SB. FIVE SEVEN FIVE SB FIVE SEVEN FIVE REMOVED OUTDATED BEARS AN EXPANSE ACCESS TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCARCERATED STUDENTS TO THE SECOND CHANCE CAL GRANTS. WHILE SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS WITH IN OUR CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS -- I WANT TO BE CLEAR PROVIDING FINANCIAL AID TO INCARCERATED STUDENT IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT -- WE'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THROUGH THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCES SECOND CHANCE PAL PILOT PROGRAM TO ALLOW THOSE INCARCERATED JUST RECEIVED PELL GRANTS TO PURSUE. POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. PROVIDING THAT EDUCATION IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION EXTENDED TO OBAMACARE PILOT PROGRAM FOR FOURTH YEAR IS A WISE CALIFORNIA NOT DOING THE SAME AND AND AND WHAT WHEN THE BENEFITS ARE CLEAR. STUDENTS WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN PARTICIPATING CORRECTIONAL -- EDUCATION HAVE 43% LOWER. INCIDENCE OF RECIDIVISM AFTER BEING RELEASED. THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS CLEAR FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED ON CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS A FORTY FIVE DOLLAR RETURN. ON INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY SPENDS ON AVERAGE OF EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR TO HOUSING IN MAY YEAH THE REVENUE NEEDED TO SUPPORT ONE FULL TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT IS SLIGHTLY OVER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. ONE OF THE MOST VALUE ASPECTS OF EDUCATION IS THAT THAT INCREASES OPPORTUNITY FOR EMPLOYMENT ONCE RELEASE EMPLOYMENT AS THE BASIS FOR BEING ABLE TO MEET ONCE BASIC NEEDS FOR FOOD AND HOUSING. WHAT EDUCATION ALONE DOES NOT SOLVE ALL THESE ISSUES OF INCARCERATION RECIDIVISM IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT WHICH IS WHY YOU WILL SEE A VARIETY OF EDUCATION CRIMINAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE? THERE ARE MANY BARRIERS TO TO SELL SO REENTRY OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED THAT HAMPER JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS PROVIDING APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS THE PUT THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK. AND BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THE BILL YOU HAVE A SECOND CHANCE IS FUNDAMENTAL NOT ONLY TO OUR STATE. BUT OUR NATION AS A WHOLE IT IS JUST AND FAIR TO PASS THIS BILL INTO INSTITUTE -- IN STATE ENERGY STATE OUR SECOND CHANCE GOT RENTS WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE PROFESSOR JAMES HARDEN FROM UC BERKELEY. AND I MEAN I ULSTER FROM UC BERKELEY STUDENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOTH. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD WELCOME TO YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD -- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL. MY NAME IS DAVID HARDING I'M A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT UC BERKELEY. MY RECENT RESEARCH FOCUS ON PRISONER RE ENTRY AND REINTEGRATION IN FEBRUARY I PUBLISHED A BOOK ON THE TOPIC TITLE ON THE OUTSIDE. I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY FROM A REINTEGRATION PERSPECTIVE. THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU IS WHO WE WANT COMING HOME FROM PRISON AND WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO WHEN THEY COME HOME. A WIDELY STATED A WIDELY CITED STUDY BY THE RAND CORPORATION FOUND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATING COLLEGE EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON OR 48% LESS LIKELY TO RECIDIVIST HAVE TO THEIR RELEASE. I ALSO BELIEVE THE TAKING COLLEGE COURSES IN PRISON WILL IMPROVE REINTEGRATION EVEN FOR THOSE WHO DON'T FINISH THE DEGREE. MANY WILL SEEK TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AFTER RELEASE AND COLLEGES ARE INSTITUTIONS WHOSE MISSION IS TO HELP PEOPLE TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES. BY ALLOWING PEOPLE IN PRISONS AND JAILS ACCESS CAL GRANTS SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE COLLEGE ENROLLMENT IN PRISON. THEIR TWO REASONS FOR THIS FIRST EVEN FOR THOSE WORK CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO COLLEGE COURSES THE EXPENSES OF BOOKS AND OTHER STUDY MATERIALS CAN BE PROHIBITIVE. THOSE SERVING TIME IN PRISON TYPICALLY HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR FAMILIES TO COVER THOSE COSTS. SECOND SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY TUITION. THIS IN TURN WILL MAKE IT MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS. AND PROGRAMS RUN BY A CREDIT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES WILL PROVIDE COURSE CRITIC ME PUT TWENTY DEGREE EVEN AFTER RELEASE. THAT WILL ENCOURAGE AND ENABLE FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE. ONE OF PEOPLE SERVING TIME IN PRISON. WILL NOT PEOPLE SERVING TIME IN PRISON TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CAL GRANTS TO MAKE THE PROGRAM WORTHWHILE I THINK WE'LL SEE THE ANSWER IS YES. IN OUR RESEARCH WITH FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WE FOUND IT ALMOST ALL WERE EAGLES EAGER FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH FEW OPTIONS WHILE THEY WERE IN PRISON. FURTHERMORE ACCORDING TO CORRECTIONS TO COLLEGE THERE OVER FORTY FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY TAKING FACE TO FACE COLLEGE COURSES IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS. A DRAMATIC INCREASE SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THERE'S STILL A LONG WAITING LIST AND MANY PRISON YARDS WHERE THERE ARE NO COLLEGE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY IN PLACE. WHAT WILL IT COST TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CUT GRANTS? FAR LESS THAN WHAT WE'RE LIKELY TO SAVE FROM LESS IMPRISONMENT AND LAST RECIDIVISM. COST OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO IMPRISON SOMEONE IN CALIFORNIA. IF AT LEAST TWO OUT OF EVERY SIXTEEN PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THE FULL FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CAL GRANT. ARE PREVENTED FROM RETURNING TO PRISON THE STATE WILL SAVE MONEY MORE THAN THAT. AND THEY'LL BE -- MORE RESOURCE RESOURCES WE CAN DEVOTE TO REHABILITATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASEPROCEED. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS A MEAN L. STERN I SUPPORT SB. FIVE SEVENTY FIVE AFTER SPENDING SIX YEARS IN JAIL WHERE -- MY GED I WAS TRANSFERRED TO VALLEY STATE PRISON FOR WOMEN IN CHOWCHILLA CALIFORNIA WHERE I SPENT AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS ON A COLLEGE WAITING LISTS. UNFORTUNATELY MY EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE I KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE EAGER TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE EDUCATION IN PRISON BUT BASS ROAD BLOCKS DUE TO EXTREMELY LONG WAIT LIST. OR SUFFER FROM INABILITY TO PAY COLLEGE TUITION PRICES. THESE POST SECONDARY COURSES HELP OPEN MY EYES TO A BIGGER WORLD IN CHALLENGE ME TO WANT A BETTER LIFE OUTSIDE OF PRISON. BEFORE MY EDUCATION I WAS MENTALLY CONFINED TO THE FEW BOX BOX WHERE I GREW UP. I PERSEVERED EARNING ASSOCIATES DEGREE AND OBTAINED ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATES HOWEVER A LONG FOR MORE. I WANTED TO ATTAIN A BACHELOR'S AND MASTER'S DEGREE BUT COULDN'T AFFORD THE COURSES REQUIRED TO EARN CREDITS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON BARRIERS STUDENTS IN PRISON FACE. AFTER MY RELEASE I WAS ACCEPTED INTO UC BERKELEY WITHIN THE RELATIVE EASE. I AM CURRENTLY THE FAMILY UNITY PROJECT -- COORDINATOR FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS ARE CHILDREN. AND A MEMBER OF BERKELEY UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS WERE WE ADVOCATE FOR CURRENTLY AND FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT POST SECONDARY COURSES I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS IN PRISON MY LIFE COULD VERY WELL BE DIFFERENT THAN I IS TODAY WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE REMOVE BARRIERS TO ACCREDITED. COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES INSIDE BY MAKING CAL GRANTS ASSESSABLE PRISONERS. HAVING SOME FORM OF COLLEGE LEVEL EDUCATION IS A NEW REQUIREMENT FOR MOST JOBS SO WITHOUT IT WE SEND PEOPLE UP TO FAIL. THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY WE NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW TRANSFORMATIVE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION IS TO FOLKS IN PRISON. THE COMMUNITIES MANY FOLKS DEVELOP INSIDE THE CLASSROOM I ONE OF TRONG SUPPORT AND DETERMINATION THAT LEADS TO A BETTER FUTURE WITH GREATER OPPORTUNITIES. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT EXPERIENCE WHILE IN PRISON THE BETTER WILL BE FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU.

AND WORKERS THAT ACTUALLY WILL BE ABLE TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES BASED ON MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. SO -- THIS BOTH HAS AN EQUITY COMPONENT AND A VERY REAL. ENVIRONMENTAL -- MANDATE BEHIND IT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES AREN'T LEFT IN A POSITION WHERE. WE'RE VULNERABLE TO OUR HOME BURNING DOWN ANALYZE BEING LOS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR -- WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE FOREMOST EXPERTS IN -- SOME OF THE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES THAT ARE NEEDED -- FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR MANY YEARS AND WE THINK THERE'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND EVEN BEYOND -- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FRAMEWORK ALL THE WAY UP. THROUGH APPRENTICESHIPS -- WORKS IN DIFFERENT TRADES -- WORK IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR WORK -- IN CONSERVATION CORES THERE'S A DIVERSITY OF OF WORK TO BE HAD HERE -- AND SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING TO PUT OUR SHOULDERS THAT WE ONLY GET THE PROCESS GOING SO WE APPRECIATE IT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE NGHT WITNESSES HERE FOR TODAY FROM YOU SEE EXTENSION. TWELVE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND THE FIRE RESTORATION GROUP THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CRAIG THOMAS -- WITH THE FIRE RESTORATION GROUP. I HAVE OVER THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING ON FEDERAL AND STATE FOREST AND FIRE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. I AM ALSO BEGAN MY EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND WERE LIVING IN THE STATE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE HOUSE THAT WAS A FANTASTIC. EXPERIENCE FIFTY YEARS AGO AN AMERICAN OR COLLEGE WHO STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT TO YOUR CURRICULUM OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE. I WON'T -- SHE BY REMINDING WITH THE ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING CALIFORNIAN TERMS A WILDFIRE SEVERITY. AND IT'S IMPACTS TO COMMUNITIES AND TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND SO THIS BILL SENATOR STERN'S BILL IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON AN EXPLICIT RESTORATION NEED -- THAT IS TREATING COMPONENTS THAT REALLY DRIVE FIRE BEHAVIOR AND GETTING A WORK FORCE LINED UP TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN PERPETUITY. ONCE WE REACH REACH RESILIENCE WE NEED TO MAINTAIN AND SERVICES OF CAREER WORK LIFETIME PERMANENT WORK THAT WE DESPERATELY NEEDING CALIFORNIA. OVER OVER DANCIN FIRE EXCLUDED FORESTS ARE HOW THE FIRE PRONE IN THEIR KEY DRIVERS OF FIRE BEHAVIOR AND THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO REMEMBER WE HAVE -- EXPLICIT BEEN VERY POSITIVE A CURRICULUM COMPONENTS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. RELATED -- TO RELATING TO FORESTRY AND TO FIGHT WELFARE TECHNOLOGY IN FIRE FIGHTING. SO WE HAVE PIECES OF CURRICULUM WE NEED TO STITCH TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT'S MORE SPECIFIC FOR RESTORATION -- SOAP CINDER STERN'S BILL OF PORCELAIN RESTORATION WORK FORCE BILL IS A SELECTIVE EFFORT TO ADD VALUE TO EXISTING NASSER RESOURCE PROGRAMS FOUND IN SEVERAL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT IS NOT AN EFFORT TO COMPLETELY REDO EXISTING COURSE CURRICULUM OFFERINGS OR TO CREATE CORRECTLY. COMPLY COMPLETELY NEW CURRICULA BUT RATHER TO STITCH TOGETHER. PORTIONS OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND FINE TUNE THEM. TO BUILD A RESTORATION WORK FORCE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FOR FOR PRESS PROFESSIONAL RESTORATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN EXISTING COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT NORTH CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CREATING A MODEL RESTORATION WORK FORCE CURRICULUM DESIGN IT THAT IS UNIQUE AND AN IS CRITICAL. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT BROAD SCALE RESTORATION IT WILL PROVIDE A PERMANENT CAREER PATHWAY TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE EFFORTS TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE LOSS OF FORCE RESILIENCE STUDENT UNCHARACTERISTIC MAGNIFIERS. AND INCREASINGLY THAT ARE INCREASINGLY COMMON IN CALIFORNIA. THE NEED FOR A PERMANENT SKILLED RESTORATION WORK FORCES NEVER BRING GREATER AS THERE IS A CRITICAL THERE IS CRITICAL NEEDS SIGNIFICANT FUNDING AND YET A SCARCITY OF COMMUNITY LEVEL WORKERS WHO KNOWS THE LANDSCAPE THE VEGETATION THE PARTNERSHIPS THE AGENCIES. THE TOOLS THE SCIENCE THE POLICY IN LAW YOU CAN MANAGE A PROFESSIONAL NOW TO RESOURCE BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE PERFECT.

WITHIN AS BEFORE SIXTY TWO IS A COMPONENT TO FUND A NETWORK OF YOU SEE ADVISERS LIKE MYSELF TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON FIRE.

FOR HEALTH CARE I AGREE WITH DOCTOR MIMI BOMBERS BACH WHEN SHE TESTIFIED LAST YEAR THAT IT FEELS A MORAL AND ETHICAL AND I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. NATIONALLY DEMAND FOR MENTAL SERVICES ARE UP 30% INCLUDING TO THIS TO MEET THIS DEMAND WITHOUT EXPANDING ACCESS WE GET QUOTE GET CREATIVE FOR INSTANCE I'VE ADDED ADDITIONAL POINTS BY REDUCING SOME OF THEM. FROM FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO THIRTY MINUTES OTHER CENTERS INSTITUTES STEP CARE WHERE SELF HELP GROUP COUNSELING COMMITTEE REFERRALS ARE PRIORITIZE OVER ONE ON ONE COUNSELING. AND THESE THINGS ARE INSUFFICIENT STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING THEY'RE DROPPING OUT AND THEY'RE DYING COUNSELING CENTERS MUST PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPANY HEALTH CARE AND SB SIX SIXTY WILL HELP THIS MEANS HAVING STAFF TO REFLECT THE RACIAL AND OTHER DIVERSITIES OF CSU STUDENTS. AS WELL AS PROVIDING INCLUSIVE CARE THAT ADDRESSES THE UNIQUE SHARED EXPERIENCES OF COMMUNITIES THAT INCREASINGLY REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF THE CSU STUDENTS MEANING BLACK BROWN IN NATIVE STUDENTS. SB SIX SIXTY WILL SUPPORT NEEDED COUNSELING CENTERS TO HIRE DIVERSE COUNTING STAFF TO MEET THESE NEEDS AND LASTLY WE CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS WE KNOW BASED ON DANIEL EISENBERG'S WORK OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THAT MENTAL PROVIDING ADDITIONAL MENTAL SERVICES PAYS FOR ITSELF IN RETENTION AND TUITION. AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE FINANCIAL WELL BEING OF FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO WEAR THE REAL COST OF IGNORING SUCH AN OBVIOUS SOLUTION AND SUPPORT APPROPRIATE AND SAFE CANCER STUDENTS STAFFING RATIOS AND DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS. ASPER SUPPORT OF SB SIX SIXTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIR LEYVA IN MEMBERS -- I AM NOT MIA SHE IS OUR PRESIDENT BUT I AM HER PROFESSIONAL STAFF SO I GET THE TAKE YOUR PLACE TODAY. SO MY NAME IS MERRY WASHINGTON ON THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ASSOCIATE FOR ON CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS. NEARLY HALF A MILLION CSU STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE THANKFUL TO SENATOR PAN AS AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION FOR THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. STUDENTS IN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM HAVE A HOST OF ISSUES THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH AS THEY ATTEMPT TO ATTAIN A DEGREE. WITH THE COST OF ATTENDANCE RISING 40%. OURS OF OUR STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS 11% ARE FOOD INSECURE AND THE POLITICAL CLIMATE AND DISCOURSE ON AND OFF OUR CAMPUSES. HAVE CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH IS CONSTANTLY BEING CHALLENGED. IN FACT THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ON OUR CAMPUS IS THE TOP PRIORITY FOR OUR STUDENTS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW. EACH YEAR CSSA CREATES A POLICY AGENDA TO GUIDE OUR STUDENTS WORK FOR THE YEAR THIS YEAR THOSE THREE PRIORITIES FOR THE CSU STUDENTS ARE. STUDENT HEALTH AND SAFETY AFFORDABILITY AND OVERALL ACADEMIC SUCCESS. AND IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY JUST UNDER HALF OF THE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES HAVE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIOS NEAR OR BELOW THE RATIO OF ONE COUNSELOR TO EVERY FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. AS PROPOSED IN SB SIX SIXTY THIS MEANS. ON THE MAJORITY OF CAMPUSES STUDENTS ARE REPORTING SIGNIFICANT WAIT TIMES TO SEE A COUNSELOR SOMETIMES UP TO A MONTH. AND CAPS ON HOW MANY TIMES THEY CAN SEE A COUNSELOR IN A YEAR SOMETIMES AS LOW AS FIVE TIMES. THAT IS WHY PASSING IN FUNDING SB SIX SIXTY IS SO CRUCIAL WHEN A STUDENT CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT NEARLY A MONTH TO SEE SOMEONE. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN PRESENT REAL AND IMMEDIATE SAFETY ISSUES FOR STUDENTS AND THE STUDENTS AROUND THEM. ADDITIONALLY ON ALL CAMPUSES STUDENT FEES ARE BEING USED TO PAY FOR THESE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES CURRENTLY. THIS MEANS THAT THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY TO EXPAND THESE RESOURCES WOULD BE -- NOT. TOO FAT TO INCREASE THOSE STUDENT FEES BUT THROUGH SB SIX SIXTY INCREASING -- REALLY ELIMINATES THAT PROBLEM ALL TOGETHER AND IT IS WHY AGAIN THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE SB SIX SIXTY WOULD ALLOCATE IS SUCH A NECESSITY FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS IS CRITICAL AND ENSURING THEIR SUCCESS. THANK YOU ALL FOR CONSIDERING THIS ISSUE AND WE ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT SB SIX SIXTY TODAY.

PROS PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU A MANAGER I'M SEEKING IN THIS BILL TO DEAL WITH THAT AMBIGUITY IN CASE LAW. AS IT RELATES TO DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTS -- BASICALLY ON ONE HAND DESIGNED BILL IS AN EX BUT A DELIVERY ON THE OTHER HAND. THE CALIFORNIA BAR MIDDLE QUALITY ACT REQUIRES FULL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THE RISK REAL QUICKLY IS THAT WHEN THE SCHOOL THIS AWARD THE CONTRACT FOR DESIGN BUILD THEIR ENDING TO AN UNCHANGEABLE AGREEMENT. THE PROJECT IS APPROVED BY THE SCHOOL BY THE SCHOOL BOARD AWARDED THE CONTRACT IN FACT DOES NOT MEAN APPROVAL. AND SO THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY CLARIFIES THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS TERMINATE THE CONTRACT MODIFIED. THE DESIGN TO COMPLY WITH SEQUEL AVOID MITIGATING SIGNIFICANT CIRCUMSTANCE OR DISAPPROVE THE PROJECT DESIGN. SO THE IDEA IS IN THERE SOME LITIGATION IT OUT IN THE LA U. S. D. AND THIS IS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT -- ALTERNATES OVER THE WITNESSES SO WE CAN CUT TO THE CHASE. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. MARCO LETTER ON THE CHIEF OF FACILITIES FOR LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION OF NEW SCHOOLS BUT WE'RE FOCUSING ON MODERNIZATION OUR CONVOLVULACEAE.

JUST TO BE ABLE TO GO FOURTEEN DO WHAT WE BELIEVE WE WERE DOING WE LIKE SEQUEL WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHANGE SEEK FOR WE'RE JUST TRYING TO ELIMINATE AN AMBIGUITY. THAT DEFINES HOW WE MOVE FORWARD THE PROJECT WE CLEARLY HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO AN OBLIGATION THAT FORCES US TO DO CONSTRUCTION. IN OUR CONTRACT ITSELF WE HAVE PROVISIONS ALLOW US TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT NOT PROCEED WITH CONSTRUCTION WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE -- THANK SENATOR BRING THIS FOR LOOK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

AND PART OF THE INTENSITY WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH A SENATOR GLAZERS BUILT. SO THERE WE ARE COULD BUILD A BUILDING OKAY ALL RIGHT SO I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND IT'S DETAILED ANALYSIS. THIS BILL SB SIX EIGHTY SIX ESTABLISHES A PROGRAM FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN. AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVING IN SOME CALIFORNIA'S MOST DISTRESSED NEIGHBORHOODS. I CHILDREN LIVING IN IN -- NUMBER THESE COMMUNITIES LACK ACCESS TO ADEQUATE HEALTH SOCIAL AND ACADEMIC PREPARATION NEEDED TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT. ACROSS CALIFORNIA 17% OF CHILDREN LIVING COMMUNITIES OF CONCENTRATED POVERTY OVER ONE POINT SIX MILLION CHILDREN. LIVE IN POVERTY HERE IN THE STATE. PLAN TO END THE CYCLE OF POVERTY FOR THESE CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES INNOVATIVE AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES ARE NEEDED. TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE SO -- THIS IS OF COURSE A NATIONAL PHENOMENON UNFORTUNATELY -- AND AND THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BACK IN TWENTY TEN ESTABLISH THE PROMISED NEIGHBORHOOD PROGRAM TO TRANSFORM SCHOOLS AND NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES ALL THROUGHOUT THE NATION. OF OF THIS TYPE THROUGH A ROBUST SYSTEM OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT. BY WHICH FAMILY MEMBERS ARE INVOLVED IN THEIR FAMILY IN THEIR CHILDREN'S ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDING THEM WITH QUALITY SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. SO IN CALIFORNIA -- THERE ARE FIVE ESTABLISH AN OPERATING PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS SERVING MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ANNUALLY. AND THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN GROWING UP I HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS SCHOOLS HEALTH SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES. RELIABLE SYSTEMS OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT THAT WILL PREPARE THEM TO A TEN X. ON EDUCATION AND AND SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO COLLEGE AND CAREERS. AND TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS VARIOUS METRICS ARE USED TO TRACK OUTCOMES INCLUDING KINDERGARTEN READINESS PROFICIENCY IN COURT K. THROUGH TWELVE SUBJECTS FAMILY ECONOMIC RESILIENCY IN SUPPORT TOWARD THE CHILD. IN THE STUDENTS ACCESS TO HEALTHY LIVING. RECENT STATS -- INDICATE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF EFFECTIVE AND ENCOURAGING OUT COMES FROM A PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD SO FAR HE WOULD HIGH SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE GRADUATION RATES. HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OTHER NOW UP 289% FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE EVEN OFF OF TWENTY ELEVEN ADDITIONALLY IN LA -- PARTICIPATING HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE COLLEGE READY IN THE PROMISED NEIGHBORHOOD IN SENATOR RISES DISTRICT. SO THIS BILL CREATES A PROGRAM TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION TO AWARD GRANTS TO IMPLEMENT A PLACE SPACE CONTINUUM OF CREEL TO COLLEGE AND CAREER SOLUTIONS. IN TARGETED HEIDI NEIGHBORHOODS THE PROGRAM INTENDS TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT COLLEGE SUCCESS CAREER READINESS AND BUILD STRONG FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT. AND WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES STICKS IN SINGER ISLAND -- FROM CALIFORNIA PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD NETWORK TO SEE CAN SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF OF SB. SIX EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ALAN PLEASE PROCEED. BIOGRAPHY WARNING A CHAIR ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I'M DIXON SINGLE AND PRESENT CEO OF THE YOUTH POLICY INSTITUTE IN LOS ANGELES AND LEAD AGENCY FOR THE LA PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'RE HERE TO EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL -- 686% AROUND COVERED A LOT OF THE KEY FACTS I WOULD ADD. THAT THIS BILL ALSO FULFILLS ONE OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE REPORT WHICH IS I I'M SURE YOU KNOW CAME OUT IN NOVEMBER. PROMISED AT A CREATING TWENTY PROMISED NEIGHBORS ACROSS THE STATE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE HE STRATEGY FOR COORDINATED SERVICES. AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. THERE ARE CURRENTLY FIVE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED PROMISED NEIGHBORS IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULD BRING THE TOTAL. TO TWENTY BY COMPETITIVELY SELECTING AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN EIGHTY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT APPLIED FOR THE FEDERAL DESIGNATION SO IS IS A GROUND SWELL OF SUPPORT AND INTEREST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN BEING DESIGNATED AS A PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD -- THIS IS A MODEL THAT WORKS WE'VE SEEN TRANSFORMATIVE RESULTS IN THE FIVE CALIFORNIA PROMISED NEIGHBORHOODS JUSTIN LA TO ADD TO THE COLLEGE READY RATE MORE THAN DOUBLING UP 271%. I GRADUATION RIGHT NOW EXCEEDS THE STATE'S RATE EVEN A MUCH HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY AND OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH PROFICIENCY ACROSS EIGHTEEN SCHOOLS. THE RATE OF GROWTH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS EXCEEDED THE STATE'S RATE. BECAUSE OF THIS IMPACT IN LA THAT BOTH LOS ENGINE FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND LA MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI. SUPPORT THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF Y. P. I. IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD NETWORK AND SUNNY MAKE PEAK WHO HAD TO WALK OUT EARLY I WANT TO CLOSE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL. SIXTY SIX THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT GO AHEAD. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICHARD REID ON THE DIRECTOR MISSION PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD AT THE MISSION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY A PROUD CO SPONSOR -- SB -- SIX EIGHT SIX THE MISSION DISTRICT IS A TRADITIONALLY WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND OVER THE LAST DECADE WE'VE SEEN EIGHT THOUSAND WORKING CLASS LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. DISPLACED FROM OUR COMMUNITY. RENT FOR TWO BEDROOM HAS RISEN TO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED PER MONTH. CAUSING FAMILIES TO TRIPLE UP IN OVERCROWDED APARTMENTS AND SOME DISPLACED STUDENTS TO COMMUTE ACROSS THE BAY TO SCHOOL. THESE AND OTHER CHALLENGES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO LOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE SIX YEARS AGO. OUR PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD BEGAN TO WORK WITH MORE THAN TWENTY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS TWO STUDENTS FROM CRADLE TO COLLEGE. AND WORK WITH THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. THE SCALE OF THE SOLUTION BEGAN TO MATCH THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. WE WERE TOGETHER AT NINE SCHOOLS AND THREE PRESCHOOLS REACHING ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND CHILDREN. AND AFTER SIX YEARS WE SAW GRADUATION RATES INCREASE FROM AND PRESCHOOL ASSESSMENT SCORES JUMPED FROM 24% 288%. PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS BREAKTHROUGH SILOS AND COORDINATE SERVICES. PARTNER SHARE DATA AND WE HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO IMPROVING RESULTS. TO RIGOROUS ANALYSIS AND PLANNING. THIS IS GOOD GOVERNMENT. THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. TODAY OUR PARTNER NETWORK HAS MADE FIVE THOUSAND CONNECTIONS TO SERVICES FOR TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FAMILIES. HALF OF THESE. HALF OF THESE HAVE BEEN FOR HOUSING AND FINANCIAL ASSET BUILDING SERVICES. OTHER REFERRALS INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH LEGAL SERVICES AND MORE. EXPANDING THIS MODEL TO MORE COMMUNITIES COULD BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA BY PREPARING OUR CHILDREN TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY. AND HELPING FAMILIES MOVE OUT OF POVERTY. THERE ARE COMMUNITIES AS NOTED EARLIER ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THIS MODEL. INCLUDING FRESNO SACRAMENTO OAKLAND MARIN AND MONTEREY. THE FIVE EXISTING PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE FORMED THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD NETWORK. AND WE STAND READY TO OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANY NEW PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT COULD RESULT FROM THIS BILL.
