00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:17.001
ARE HARDER TO PROVE IN GENERAL

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.335
INTENT CRIMES IN GENERAL INTENT

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:21.772
CRIME AT YOUR SHOW THAT THE ACT

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:24.675
WAS DONE THAT'S THE END OF IT

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:25.309
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ON. AND OF

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:28.312
THE- OF THE PERPETRATOR. AND

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:31.015
THAT IS THE SORT OF IT HOW DO

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:33.517
WE PROVE INTENT AS I UNDERSTAND

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:36.520
IT THIS. THIS BILL TALKS ABOUT

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:40.024
INTENT RIGHT- BUT WHAT DOES

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.492
THAT MEAN ATTENTION OF THE

00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:43.694
POSSESSION OF A OF A BOX CUTTER

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.730
OR OTHER PACKAGES AND I WOULD

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.532
RESPECTFULLY. DISAGREE WITH THE

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.034
NOTION THAT RICH PEOPLE CAN GO

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.535
OUT AND READ BY THINGS I THINK

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:54.171
THAT IF THE STAFF- AND I THINK

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.106
THAT WE HAVE TO RESPECT THAT.

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:58.075
THE VICTIMS OF THAT THE F. BUT

00:42:58.142 --> 00:43:00.277
I CHEST I'M HAVING TROUBLE

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:02.112
SEEING WHY WE NEED TO ADD THIS

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:04.281
PARTICULAR. OFFENSE WHEN WE

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:06.050
ALREADY A PETTY THEFT AND WE

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:07.718
ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:09.420
CONNECT WITH THE SAME

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:12.790
PUNISHMENT THAT THAT NOW THIS

00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:14.658
WOULD MOVE FORWARD I THINK YOU

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:16.593
ON A KEY TOPIC THERE THE

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.796
INTENT. AND THEN I ALSO

00:43:18.862 --> 00:43:20.364
APPRECIATE YOUR CALM. IN A

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:23.734
RECORDING EIGHT OF THE VICTIMS

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:26.270
I WAS SURPRISED IN IN STE THE

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:28.472
RADIO BUT I DID THIS IS. TENS

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:33.143
THERE'S- ONE OF THE COMMENTS

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.611
FOR LISTENERS I. AM DON'T

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.046
REMEMBER WHAT MEDIA MARK WAS IN.

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:36.647
BUT WHAT IF THE PERSON TAKING

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:37.247
PACKAGE NEEDS AND THE PER IN

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:40.250
ORDER THE PACK. I LIKE I DON'T

00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:41.251
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:44.021
QUESTION YOU KNOW- BUT BACK TO

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:45.990
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT INTENT IN

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:47.858
IF SUMMER WANTS TO JUMP IN HERE

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.593
WITH A BETTER LOCATION. I'M

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.728
HAPPY TO DO THAT BECAUSE THAT

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:52.830
HAS COME UP A COUPLE TIMES AND-

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:53.664
AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:56.066
IS MORE DIFFICULT TO PROVE

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.501
CONTENT WE- DISCUSS THAT- WHEN

00:43:57.568 --> 00:44:00.637
WE ARE. INTRODUCING THE KEY

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:02.506
TRACK. I THINK CURTILAGE. AND

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:05.142
THEN. FENCE AND SO YOU'VE GOT.

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:07.544
AND THEN AS SUMMER- ALLUDED TO

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:10.047
THE ORGANIZATION. ASPECT OF

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:11.482
THIS WHEN YOU PUT ALL THOSE

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:13.784
TOGETHER. I THINK THAT'S WHEN

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:14.985
THE AND I'M NOT I'M NOTBEEN A

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:17.821
PROSECUTOR- NOR. FORTUNATELY

00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:19.957
EVER PROSECUTED SO I AVEN'T

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:23.227
LIVED THAT EXPERIENCE- I DON'T

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:27.398
THINK THEY GO HAND IN HAND. SO

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:28.532
I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S UP TO THE

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.434
PROSECUTOR IN LAW OBVIOUSLY LAW

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:33.604
ENFORCEMENT TO PUT THOSE THINGS

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.105
TOGETHER I THINK THAT ALSO

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.006
ADDRESSES. TURNS AT THE WITH.

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:39.243
OUR OF. APPROACH IN IN AND AT.

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:40.511
YOU KNOW ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:43.213
AS WELL THAT. THIS IS ALREADY A

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.716
HARD THING TO PROVE. AND SO

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:48.452
YOU'RE HAVING TO HAVE- A

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:50.821
PERSON. OFFENDED ME MULTIPLE

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:53.991
TIMES FOR THIS TO COME INTO

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:55.526
FACT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ENTER

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:56.894
THE CURTILAGE WHICH IS A

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.165
DEFINED. AS DIFFERENT FREE TO-

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:04.401
DOMICILE BECAUSE HE DOMICILED.

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:05.469
THIRTY I JUST LEARNED THIS I

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:07.838
SAW LIKE EXPERT I'M REALLY NOT

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:08.372
BUT YOU KNOW FOR A SINGLE

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.107
FAMILY HOME THE CURTILAGE BEGAN

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:11.875
BEGINS WITH YOU CROSS OFF THE

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.844
PUBLIC SIDEWALK UNDER THE

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:16.080
PERSONAL PROPERTY AND AN

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:17.548
APARTMENT IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S

00:45:17.614 --> 00:45:19.416
AT THE DOOR YOU KNOW THE NOT

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:20.717
ALWAYS OF THE BUILDING AND

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:22.419
YOU'RE NOT IN THE CURRENT. AGE

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:26.723
OF THAT HOME- SO. I THINK WHEN

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.891
YOU PUT ALL THOSE THINGS

00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:29.126
TOGETHER AND THEN OTHER ASPECTS

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:32.496
OF THE- CASE INDIVIDUAL CASES I

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:33.297
THINK IS WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:35.132
DEVELOP INTENT. THE PROBLEM IS

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:37.801
IF I'M IN AND OUT OF THE FOR

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:40.771
THE NEXT. QUESTION THE PROBLEM

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:42.039
IS IT'S STILL PETTY THEFT

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:42.739
WHETHER THEY'RE IN YOUR

00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:45.375
CURTILAGE OR NOT AND I IT JUST

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:47.578
SEEMS TO ME WHILE RECOGNIZING

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:49.012
THAT THESE KINDS OF PETTY

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.714
THEFTS ARE OCCURRING. MORE AND

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:53.050
MORE FREQUENTLY- AND-

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:55.552
APPALLINGLY SELF FOR A VARIETY

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:57.654
OF REASONS- IT SEEMS THAT WE

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.656
HAVE THE ABILITY NAY. TO

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:01.792
PROSECUTE AND PERHAPS THE

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.293
QUESTION TO THE TO THE DISTRICT

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.096
ATTORNEY IF I MAY IS. WHY IS IT

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:07.564
OUR PERSPECTIVE IS A PROSECUTOR

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:11.335
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT GIVEN

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:12.603
THE FACT THAT THE- DEFENSE IS

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:15.539
GOING TO BE MISTER. THIRTY

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:16.106
WOULD THAT YOU WOULD CHARGE

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:17.941

00:46:18.008 --> 00:46:19.776
CHARGE IF YOU WERE GOING TO GO

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:21.111
AHEAD AND PROSECUTE SOMEONE WHO

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:23.046
WAS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING. THE

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:26.884
OFFENSE. MODERATOR WILL ALLOW-

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:40.930
ODD PANDEMIC CIRCUMSTANCE AND-

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.099
WHEN WE WERE- FIRST SITTING

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:47.837
BILLS FOR THE- HEARING I DIDN'T

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.872

HOUSES I CERTAINLY HAS TO THE

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:57.246
BILL. AND REPORTER END UP. IN

01:01:57.313 --> 01:02:02.518
IT I WAS NOT FULLY AWARE OF THE-

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:04.821
OF WHAT ARE THE OTHER EXISTING

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:08.524
STATUTES AND BASICALLY THE BILL

01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:10.093
WOULD BE TO COMPARE AS IT'S

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.528
BEEN DISCUSSED HERE WHETHER WE

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:15.531
ARE STATUTES ARE ADEQUATE NOW

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:18.468
THERE'S CERTAIN. YOU THE AUTHOR

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.336
AND THE DS. MAY YOUR CASE AS TO

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.137
WHY YOU THINK THEY ARE

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:24.674
INADEQUATE HOWEVER I AFTER

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.609
REVIEWING THE ANALYSIS AND

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:29.345
ESPECIALLY THE DEBATE DAY. IT

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:33.549
SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS. WELL

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.151
I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE SOME

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:36.486
PEOPLE FEELING THAT THIS IS

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.788
REALLY NECESSARY IT IN FACT

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:42.725
SEEMS REDUNDANT AND THE ISSUE

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:47.730
OF. BEING ABLE TO ALLOW SOMEONE

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:50.900
PROSECUTED FOR INTENT THAT IS A

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.835
VERY DIFFICULT THING TO PROVE

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:53.503
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE SOMEONE

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:54.370
BEING PROSECUTED BECAUSE THEY

PACKAGE WE ON THE FRONT LAWN.

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:02.211
SO THE CURTILAGE ISSUE IS ON IF

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:05.548
YOU SEE. THE ISSUE OF WHETHER

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.783
YOU HAPPENED TO BE THERE.

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:09.585

02:08:56.128 --> 02:08:57.696
COVER UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT

02:08:57.763 --> 02:08:59.131
SAID IF YOU WERE LOW INCOME AND

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:00.966
THAT CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT YOU

02:09:01.033 --> 02:09:03.202
SHOULD BE WAVE CHARACTER

02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:06.605
PURSUING EVERYBODY ON. I

02:09:06.672 --> 02:09:08.006
APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:10.008
THAT IF THE STATE MANDATE SAYS

02:09:10.075 --> 02:09:11.877
THAT WE ELIMINATE FINES AND

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:14.012
FEES BUT THAT'S NOT THE

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:15.314
PRACTICE THAT. IN THE COUNTY

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:17.382
SEVEN GATE A GOOD NUMBER OF

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:19.184
COUNTIES HAD VOLUNTARILY STOP

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.986
THE PRACTICE BEFORE WE EVEN

02:09:21.053 --> 02:09:22.354
INTRODUCED THE BILL TWO YEARS

02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:25.457
AGO BECAUSE THEY FOUND THAT

02:09:25.524 --> 02:09:26.625
VERTICALLY WITH WITH REGARD TO

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:28.861
JUVENILES IT WAS COUPLE IN

02:09:28.927 --> 02:09:29.862
THEIR ABILITY TO REUNITE WITH

02:09:29.928 --> 02:09:33.799
THEIR FAMILIES AND ALL JUVENILE

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:36.568
LOCKED TALKS ABOUT THE WHOLE

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:37.936
POINT IS TO REUNIFY AN

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:39.972
IMPROVISED AT THE PORT OF

02:09:40.038 --> 02:09:43.041
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- FAMILIES.

02:09:43.108 --> 02:09:45.110
RESEARCH SHOWED UP AND- WERE

02:09:45.177 --> 02:09:48.080
COMPLICATED. I AGREE TO YOUR

02:09:48.147 --> 02:09:49.915
BILL. AND SO THAT'S RAIMES TO

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:53.385
GET OKAY FINE STOP IT YOU KNOW

02:09:53.452 --> 02:09:56.655
IT'S NOT WORKING FOR A GOOD

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:58.624
NUMBER OF REASONS. BUT WE

02:09:58.690 --> 02:10:00.526
DIDN'T MAKE IT RETROACTIVE SOON

02:10:00.592 --> 02:10:02.227
ITS ANOTHER SISTER RECEIVABLE

02:10:02.294 --> 02:10:04.563
ON THE BOOKS WRITTEN. HARD TO

02:10:04.630 --> 02:10:08.467
COLLECT IN. MOST MANAGERS SO

02:10:08.534 --> 02:10:10.869
SAID LET'S NOT SPENDING MORE

02:10:10.936 --> 02:10:12.137
MONEY ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:13.972
WORTH THE TIME AND SENATE

02:10:14.039 --> 02:10:16.341
CLAIRE'S CASE. SPENDING MORE

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:19.244
THAN THEY'RE RECEIVING SO THAT

02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:21.113
ALL MAKES SENSE BUT- FOR THOSE

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:22.781
COUNTIES THAT SOMEHOW HAVEN'T

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:24.783
COME TO THAT CONCLUSION WE'RE

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:26.451
NOW UNILATERALLY SAYING TO A

02:10:26.518 --> 02:10:30.556
LOCAL BODY. YOU WILL. RIGHT OFF

02:10:30.622 --> 02:10:32.591
YOUR RECEIVABLES. END OF

02:10:32.658 --> 02:10:35.594
DISCUSSION. AND I'M I'M

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:38.263
WONDERING WHY SHOULD WE DO THAT

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:41.700
TO A LOCAL AGENCY. WHEN THEY

02:10:41.767 --> 02:10:45.270
CAN DO IT ON THE ROAD. AN

02:10:45.337 --> 02:10:46.138
THROUGH THE CHAIR YOU MAY

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:50.309
ANSWER MITCHELL. SORRYSENATOR

02:10:50.375 --> 02:10:52.911
ALTHOUGH. HE WAS LOOKING AT ME

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:55.380
THAT'S WHY I LEAN BACK IN I HE

02:10:55.447 --> 02:10:56.548
RIGHT I SEE YOU BUT YOU KNOW

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:58.483
AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR

02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:00.619
DESIRE IN THE ORIGINAL BILL-

02:11:00.686 --> 02:11:03.722
BUT WE WERE CLEAR THAT WE WERE-

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:06.024
FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL BRAND

02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:08.293
AND WANTED TO STOP COLLECTION

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:11.997
FROM POINT AND THE GOLD EXTRA

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:14.199
STEP. WHICH UP. COUNTIES THAT

02:11:14.266 --> 02:11:15.968
HAVE NOW COME ON. FAQ ANNUAL

02:11:16.034 --> 02:11:18.370
ALSO WORK THAT YOU KNOW THE

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:20.572
COUNTIES BEGIN TO COOK BEGAN

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.040
COLLECTING THESE FINES AND FEES

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:23.742
DURING A TIME WHEN THERE

02:11:23.809 --> 02:11:26.278
BUDGETS WERE REDUCED- AS A

02:11:26.345 --> 02:11:30.282
RESULT OF STATE CUT BACKS AND

02:11:30.349 --> 02:11:33.285
SO IT BECAME. A EIGHT HM ISSUE

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:35.687
AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER IT REALLY

02:11:35.754 --> 02:11:36.255
IS FOR THE MILLIE THE RIGHT

02:11:36.321 --> 02:11:38.557
THING TO DO AND SELL ONLY

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:40.892
INTRODUCED A BILL AND SEVENTEEN

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:43.495
IT WAS DURING A TIME WHEN-

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:45.330
LOCAL COFFERS WERE CERTAINLY

02:11:45.397 --> 02:11:48.800
MORE FLOOD NAY HAD BEEN IN THE

02:11:48.867 --> 02:11:50.168
PREVIOUS TEN YEARS. A AGAIN

02:11:50.235 --> 02:11:52.070
LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH.

02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:53.639
PROPONENTS ON THE PHONE

02:11:53.705 --> 02:11:55.707
RECOGNIZING HOW MANY COUNTIES

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:58.076
WERE ON COLLECTING UNDER

02:11:58.143 --> 02:12:00.479
CURRENT LAW INAPPROPRIATELY AND

02:12:00.545 --> 02:12:02.648
THAT WAS THE REAL PUSH. AND SO

02:12:02.714 --> 02:12:03.382
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:04.583
WHETHER NOTS IT'S APPROPRIATE

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:05.851
TO FORCE COUNTIES TO NOT

02:12:05.917 --> 02:12:08.053
COLLECTED A RECEIVABLE ON I

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.254
GUESS THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW THE

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:11.223
MATTER OPINION ON THEY THERE'S

02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:12.724
RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTED IT WAS

02:12:12.791 --> 02:12:13.925
AND PROBABLY AN INAPPROPRIATE

02:12:13.992 --> 02:12:16.328
ACTION TO TAKE IN THE FIRST

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:17.262
PLACE. TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I

02:12:17.329 --> 02:12:19.698
AM AND WE WILL. AT BUT IT WAS

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:20.565
OF THE LAW AND SO THEY DID WHAT

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:22.968
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AND-

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:24.903
AND SO NOW I JUST WONDER IF

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:27.139
THERE'S A WAY TO SPLIT THE BABY

02:12:27.205 --> 02:12:27.773
LIKE. WE'LL GIVE YOU TO FOR THE

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:29.641
REMAINING QUE. TEN CENTS ON THE

02:12:29.708 --> 02:12:31.443
DOLLAR. AS OPPOSED TO JUST

02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:34.680
TAKING IT ALL AWAY- AND THAT'S

02:12:34.746 --> 02:12:36.048
JUST THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING.

02:12:36.114 --> 02:12:37.416
MAYBE THE BUSINESS HANGOVER BUT

02:12:37.482 --> 02:12:38.817
ALL THAT. AND AGAIN I WANT TO

02:12:38.884 --> 02:12:41.119
SAY THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL YOU

02:12:41.186 --> 02:12:43.622
KNOW IT WASN'T A STATE. LAW

02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:45.190
THAT. MANDATED THAT THEY

02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:46.258
COLLECT THE FINES AND FEES IN

02:12:46.325 --> 02:12:47.726
THE FIRST PLACE. THOSE ARE

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:48.660
DECISIONS MADE AT THE LOCAL

02:12:48.727 --> 02:12:52.531
LEVEL. BUT WHAT IS IF THEY FOR.

02:12:52.597 --> 02:12:53.832
COLLECTING FINES AND FEES.

02:12:53.899 --> 02:12:54.399
BECAUSE THE STATE. REQUIRED

02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:58.837
THAT THEY DO SO. NOT BUT NOW

02:12:58.904 --> 02:13:00.205
IT'S STATE COMING IN SAYING

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:03.008

TREMENDOUS BACKLOG IN TRIAL

02:20:04.195 --> 02:20:05.930
THAT WE HAVE IN THE COURTS. OR

THE COLD TEEN SITUATION. THIS

02:20:09.033 --> 02:20:10.168
WHOLE STUDY WHEN THE PEREMPTORY

LIMIT WAS SET AT TEN AND I

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:14.806
THINK THIS IS INTERESTING TO

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:16.341
NOTE THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF

MAXIMUM WAS REDUCED TO SIX THE

02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:25.483
AVERAGE DROPPED OF FOR THE

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:28.119
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WERE RARELY

02:20:28.186 --> 02:20:29.754
USING MORE THAN THE SIX TO

WHICH WERE ENTITLED NO BY THE

02:20:34.592 --> 02:20:37.829
WAY. VERY IMPORTANT. IN ANY WAY

02:20:37.896 --> 02:20:39.631
FIVE WAR CAN. TURN ANY OTHER IN.

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:41.166
THAT THE REDUCED NUMBER OF

02:20:41.232 --> 02:20:43.601
PEREMPTORIES IS DAMAGING TO

02:20:43.668 --> 02:20:46.137
CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS I BELIEVE

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:47.205
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

DIFFICULT TO DO ASSEMBLY. COOL

A COURT ROOM RIGHT NOW- I COULD

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:12.869

WE WILL NOT BE IN THIS

02:40:28.385 --> 02:40:31.822
CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD HAVE LIKE

02:40:31.888 --> 02:40:36.326
EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IF THIS YEAR'S

02:40:36.393 --> 02:40:38.929

02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:49.339
HAVE A SITUATION WHERE OUR

02:40:49.406 --> 02:40:52.042
JURIES AREN'T NECESSARILY

02:40:52.109 --> 02:40:54.444
REPRESENTATIVE. OUR POPULATION

02:40:54.511 --> 02:40:57.848
AS A WHOLE AND SO TO REDUCE THE

02:40:57.914 --> 02:40:59.950
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. DOES

02:41:00.017 --> 02:41:03.086
CREATE A SITUATION WHERE THE

02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:05.355
DID IT JUST RESTRICTS THE

02:41:05.422 --> 02:41:07.891
ABILITY FOR THE TO HELP ENSURE

02:41:07.958 --> 02:41:09.960

FEAR PROCESS SO I. A WOULD STAY

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:21.605
OFF OF IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I

02:41:21.671 --> 02:41:23.607
WOULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE TO

02:41:39.523 --> 02:41:41.024
SUPPORT BY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE

IF I MAY RESPOND YES LAWYERS

02:41:46.196 --> 02:41:50.133
FOR A GO AHEAD SAM JACKSON IBM.

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:52.602
I APPRECIATE THE PASSION WITH

02:41:52.669 --> 02:41:55.172
WHICH THE- PUBLIC DEFENDER

02:41:55.238 --> 02:41:56.873
ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF THEIR

02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:00.377
CLIENTS BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE.

02:42:00.444 --> 02:42:03.513
OF THE JUDGES ARE THERE TO DO

02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:07.951
JUSTICE. AND THE I DON'T THINK

02:42:08.018 --> 02:42:09.886
ANYBODY DISAGREES ABOUT THE

02:42:09.953 --> 02:42:12.089
NOTION IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE

02:42:12.155 --> 02:42:13.423
A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JURY. THAT

02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:16.993
IS CRITICS. AND I BELIEVE THAT

02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:18.328
IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE

02:42:18.395 --> 02:42:20.230
WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST

02:42:20.297 --> 02:42:21.998
THREE YEARS AND WHAT YOU HEARD

02:42:22.065 --> 02:42:24.101
THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE LOS

02:42:24.167 --> 02:42:25.435
ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT

02:42:25.502 --> 02:42:28.205
ARTICULATE IS THAT IN FACT THIS

02:42:28.271 --> 02:42:30.240
IS A PROP AS THE US WORK. AND

02:42:30.307 --> 02:42:34.411
IF YOU COULD JUST STICK. PRIOR

02:42:34.478 --> 02:42:35.612
TO THE REDUCTION FROM TEN TO

02:42:35.679 --> 02:42:38.081
SIX. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF

02:42:38.148 --> 02:42:39.316
PEREMPTORIES AN ATTORNEY WOULD

02:42:39.382 --> 02:42:41.651
USE IN A MISDEMEANOR CASE WAS

02:42:41.718 --> 02:42:43.186
FIVE POINT TWO FOR THE

02:42:43.253 --> 02:42:44.988
PROSECUTOR AND FIVE POINT SEVEN

02:42:45.055 --> 02:42:48.158
FOR DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. SO THE

02:42:48.225 --> 02:42:49.993
DATA SHOWS THAT THEY DON'T USE

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:53.163
TEN ANYWAY. AFTER THE LIMIT WAS

02:42:53.230 --> 02:42:55.232
REDUCED TO SIX THE AVERAGE

02:42:55.298 --> 02:42:57.000
DROPPED TO THREE POINT NINE

02:42:57.067 --> 02:43:00.604
PERCENT. OR THREE POINT NINE

02:43:00.670 --> 02:43:03.006
PEREMPTORIES FOR PROSECUTOR AND

02:43:03.073 --> 02:43:05.542
FOR PEREMPTORIES FOR DEFENSE

02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:09.579
COUNSEL OUT. THERE IS THE

02:43:09.646 --> 02:43:12.749
ABILITY IN A CASE FOR AN

02:43:12.816 --> 02:43:14.451
ATTORNEY TO REQUEST THAT THE ID

02:43:14.518 --> 02:43:16.153
NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY SHOULD BE

02:43:16.219 --> 02:43:18.455
EXTENDED SO THIS DOES NOT

02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:21.725
PRECLUDE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE

02:43:21.791 --> 02:43:24.694
ASK FOR A AND FOR A COURT IN

02:43:24.761 --> 02:43:26.763
DOING JUSTICE WHICH IS THE JOB

02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:29.699
OF THESE JUDGES. OUR TO A LOT

02:43:29.766 --> 02:43:31.935
OF FOR A PEREMPTORIES. THE

02:43:32.002 --> 02:43:35.672
NOTION THAT. WE ARE BALANCING

02:43:35.739 --> 02:43:38.942
EFFICIENCY AGAINST JUSTICE IS

02:43:39.009 --> 02:43:41.478
JUST SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE BUT I

02:43:41.545 --> 02:43:43.046
DO SHADE I WITH FORMER

02:43:43.113 --> 02:43:45.582
PROSECUTOR BUT ENHANCE WITH.

02:43:45.649 --> 02:43:47.184
WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND

02:43:47.250 --> 02:43:48.785
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS EVERYBODY HAS

02:43:48.852 --> 02:43:50.120
A PASSION REPRESENTING THEIR

02:43:50.187 --> 02:43:52.756
POINT OF VIEW BUT THE ARBITER

02:43:52.822 --> 02:43:56.326
IS THE JUDGE. THIS IS A MEASURE

02:43:56.393 --> 02:43:58.695
THAT HAS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT

02:43:58.762 --> 02:44:01.264
BY THE COURTS NOT BECAUSE THEY

02:44:01.331 --> 02:44:05.168
THINK IT'S GOING TO REDUCE OUR

02:44:05.235 --> 02:44:05.769
JUSTICE IN FACT THAT IT'S NOT

02:44:05.835 --> 02:44:08.071
THE CASE. YOU HAVE NO IMPACT.

02:44:08.138 --> 02:44:11.107
IMPLICIT YES. YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:44:11.174 --> 02:44:13.009
THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S CREATED A

02:44:13.076 --> 02:44:15.712
WHOLE EFFORT TO ADDRESS THAT

02:44:15.779 --> 02:44:17.714
PROBLEM WHETHER WE HAVE TEN

02:44:17.781 --> 02:44:19.783
PEREMPTORIES OR SIX ISN'T GOING

02:44:19.849 --> 02:44:22.118
TO ADDRESS THE IMPLICIT BIAS

02:44:22.185 --> 02:44:23.053
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

02:44:23.119 --> 02:44:26.356
SOCIETY SO TO TRY TO INFLATE

02:44:26.423 --> 02:44:29.025
THOSE TWO I THINK IS NOT AN

02:44:29.092 --> 02:44:31.795
ACCURATE WITH OF WHAT THIS BILL

02:44:31.861 --> 02:44:38.735
DOES I THINK THAT. PEREMPTORIES

02:44:38.802 --> 02:44:40.604
THIS IS CHARLES TO IT WITH ALL

02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:41.638
DUE RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC

02:44:41.705 --> 02:44:44.841
DEFENDERS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY

02:44:44.908 --> 02:44:48.345
TO TRY TO PUSH THAT ENVELOPE-

02:44:48.411 --> 02:44:50.046
TO WHAT THEY PERCEIVED JUSTICE

02:44:50.113 --> 02:44:52.048
TO BE. AND I RESPECT THAT THEY

02:44:52.115 --> 02:44:54.584
ARE ADVOCATES THE ADVOCATE FOR

02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:56.386
THEIR CLIENTS WE HAVE THOUGH

02:44:56.453 --> 02:44:58.255
THE COURTS. SAYING THE

02:44:58.321 --> 02:45:00.857
DISPENSING OF JUSTICE IS NOT

02:45:00.924 --> 02:45:03.426
IMPAIRED AND AS WE LOOK AT THE

02:45:03.493 --> 02:45:06.196
FUTURE HERE. AND THE FACT THAT

02:45:06.263 --> 02:45:08.298
WE ARE IN THIS DIFFICULT

02:45:08.365 --> 02:45:10.267
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE WILL

02:45:10.333 --> 02:45:12.502
BE MANY JURORS PERSPECTIVE

02:45:12.569 --> 02:45:14.337
JURORS WILL NOT SHOW UP. IT'S

02:45:14.404 --> 02:45:15.872
ARE GETTING I'M AWARE OF MASS

02:45:15.939 --> 02:45:18.875
TODAY. ARM I THINK THAT THIS IS

02:45:18.942 --> 02:45:20.176
A REASONABLE MEASURE I WOULD

02:45:20.243 --> 02:45:22.746
LIKE I WOULD SUBMIT THAT WITH

02:45:22.812 --> 02:45:25.949
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE

02:45:26.016 --> 02:45:26.516
CASE AND THAT INITIAL REPORT

02:45:26.583 --> 02:45:28.418
THIS ED. OVER AGAIN WAS DONE IN

02:45:28.485 --> 02:45:32.188
THE PARTS OF THIS PROCESS I

02:45:32.255 --> 02:45:36.059
THINK THIS IS CHARGED- A DESIRE

02:45:36.126 --> 02:45:39.562
TO GO TO. THERE WERE.

02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:41.131
APPRECIATE THE FACT. HEARD AS

02:45:41.197 --> 02:45:42.999
AND MANY THINGS TO ALMOST ACT

02:45:43.066 --> 02:45:44.534
BUT THEY TURNED OUT TO A GOOD.

02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:47.037
I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THIS IS

02:45:47.103 --> 02:45:49.105
INDEED A GOOD MEASURE. BECAUSE

02:45:49.172 --> 02:45:51.441
IT WILL ALLOW US THE

02:45:51.508 --> 02:45:52.876
OPPORTUNITY BOTH ADDRESS THE

02:45:52.942 --> 02:45:54.144
REALITIES OF THE CURRENT

02:45:54.210 --> 02:45:56.012
SITUATION IT ALLOWS FOR

02:45:56.079 --> 02:45:58.882
ADDITIONAL PEREMPTORIES IF IN

02:45:58.948 --> 02:46:00.684
FACT THAT IS WARRANTED. ARE WE

02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:03.253
ALSO KNOW THAT THE DATA ALONE

02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:04.888
AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

02:46:04.954 --> 02:46:06.456
DISAGREE I KNOW PUBLIC

02:46:06.523 --> 02:46:08.058
DEFENDERS WILL BRING UP

02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:09.926
LITIGATION FOR ANY PURPOSE. IF

02:46:09.993 --> 02:46:12.862
THEY FELT THAT THIS BILL WAS OR

02:46:12.929 --> 02:46:14.798
THAT THIS LAW AS IT EXISTS

02:46:14.864 --> 02:46:16.966
TODAY WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THEY

02:46:17.033 --> 02:46:20.170
WOULD HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION TO

02:46:20.236 --> 02:46:21.905
TRY TO OVERTURN IT AND THEY

02:46:21.971 --> 02:46:23.606
NOT. OR IF THEY HAVE IT IS

02:46:23.673 --> 02:46:28.378
APPROVED SO ONCE WE COME OUT OF

02:46:28.445 --> 02:46:29.913
ALL THE- HI PER. TEN BECAUSE-

02:46:29.979 --> 02:46:32.048
AGAIN I. GET DOWN TO IS THE

02:46:32.115 --> 02:46:34.384
FACT THIS HAS BEEN WORKING. WE

02:46:34.451 --> 02:46:35.352
HAVE NOT SEEN AN INCREASE IN

02:46:35.418 --> 02:46:36.886
THE NUMBER OF- OR THE PEOPLE

02:46:36.953 --> 02:46:39.322
GOING TO THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL

02:46:39.389 --> 02:46:41.725
THERE IS THAT OUTLET IF THEY

02:46:41.791 --> 02:46:43.360

PEREMPTORIES. STUDY GOING ON DO

02:46:45.929 --> 02:46:47.430
WITH A MUCH BROADER ISSUE OF

02:46:47.497 --> 02:46:50.066
IMPLICIT BIAS AND I BELIEVE

02:46:50.133 --> 02:46:52.702
THAT UNDER THIS CURRENT

02:46:52.769 --> 02:46:53.970

OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE

02:47:00.810 --> 02:47:03.513
PROBLEM AN ONGOING BASIS WILL

02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:06.516
ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO

02:47:06.583 --> 02:47:09.285
ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF. THE

02:47:09.352 --> 02:47:11.888
THOSE PAST THIS AND THOSE

PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ARE AN

02:47:46.289 --> 02:47:48.691
ODD THING AND I THINK SOMETIMES
