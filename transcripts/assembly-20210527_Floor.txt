MISTER ROSS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THREE EIGHT A MEASURE TO BRING FORWARD THE VOICE OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE ON THE ISSUE OF MISTREATMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF A HORDE PASS OF THIS STATE'S HISTORY. ONE THAT TRUSTEES IN GENOCIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. VERY LITTLE OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN SLAVERY DURING THE MISSION PERIOD IS CAPTURED IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS SPANISH MISSIONARIES AND THE MILITARY SUB DUDE AND ENSLAVE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS TO FORCED LABOR AND DISPLACED FAMILY MEMBERS IN THEIR QUEST TO COLONIZE THE ALREADY INHABITED CALIFORNIA. A MENTALITY THAT CARRIED FORWARD TO THE STATE'S EARLIEST LEADERS WITH THE FIRST GOVERNOR SITTING PAID BOUNTIES TO FORM MILITIAS AIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO EMBARKED ON A DELIBERATE POLICY OF GENOCIDE AS DEFINED BY POST HOLOCAUST HUMAN RIGHTS TRIGGERING TRIBUNALS. ONE PARA SET UP SERVES AS A CONSTANT REMINDER OF THAT ERA OF VIEWING CALIFORNIA INDIANS AS LESS THAN HUMAN. SOME ARGUE THAT TODAY'S VALUES SHOULD NOT JUDGE SARAH YET AS EARLY AS FIFTEEN THIRTY SPANISH KING CARLOS SAID I FORBADE SLAVERY DUE TO MISTREATMENT OF INDIANS AND IN FIFTEEN THIRTY SEVEN POPE PAUL THE THIRD ISSUE AN ETIQUETTE TRYING TO AND MASSACRES AND SLAVE MEANT OF INDIAN PEOPLE. FRENCH NAVY CAPTAIN WHAT JEAN PRACTICE TO GOLUB A AND- MONTEREY THE STATE. NOW KNOWN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS APPALLED BY THE MISSIONARIES ABUSE OF NATIVE AMERICANS WRITING BAD CORPORAL PUNISHMENT IS INEFFECTIVE ON THE INDIANS OF BOTH SEXES WHO NEGLECT THE EXCISE OF PITY AND MANY SINS WHERE IN EUROPE ARE LEFT TO DIVINE JUSTICE. CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EVEN SOME CATHOLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE REMOVED TRUCK TRIBUTES TO SARAH. AND IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN MISTER SPEAKER. POPE FRANCIS APOLOGIZE FOR THE MANY SAID FROM AGAINST THE NATIVE PEOPLES OF AMERICA AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS YES FOR FIFTY YEARS HIS STATUE HAS STOOD IN THE CAPITOL GROUNDS AS A CONSTANT REMINDER TO THE NATIVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED AGAINST THEM AND THE HORRID TREATMENT INFLICTED UPON THEM DURING THE SO CALLED COLONIZATION PERIOD. THIS BILL WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO WERE OPPRESSED ENSLAVED AND FORCED INTO LABOR TO BUILD THOSE MISSIONS TO ONCE AND FOR ALL TO HAVE A VOICE A VOICE THAT WILL TELL A FACTUAL ACCOUNT OF HISTORY. THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID AT THE LEVEL THAT WOULD GIVE A BALANCED APPROACH TO THE PAST IT HAS BEEN ONE SIDED FOR YEARS NOW IS THAT TIME FOR THE VOICE TO BE HEARD THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE THIS BILL WILL BRING IN A NEW ERA. CALIFORNIA'S ELECTED OFFICIALS TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT THE WRONGS OF THE PAST AND RECOGNIZE THE IMMENSE CONTRIBUTIONS THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO THIS GREAT STATE. M. THE AMOUNTS COST AT WHICH SHOWS CONTRIBUTIONS CAME. AB THREE THREE EIGHT WILL AUTHORIZE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LONG OVERDUE MONUMENT TO THE TRIBES WHO CONTINUE TO CALL THIS PLACE HOME IT WILL BRING A LONG OVER DUE. PROCESS TO THE MEMORIZATION OF A MAN WHO SET FORTH THE MENTALITY OF TREATING CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE AS LESS THAN HUMAN BY D. AUTHORIZING THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THE SIERRA STATUE IN THE CAPITOL I ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THE MISS ROSS MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE AS A PROUD.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I STAND TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE EIGHT WE'VE DISCUSSED GENOCIDES RACIAL INJUSTICES AND CONTINUED DISCRIMINATION ON THIS FLOOR MANY TIMES BEFORE. THIS BILL WILL SERVE AS THE END OF A LONG AWAITED PERIOD IN THE LIVES OF THE NATIVE PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA LONG OVERDUE- JUST AS WE HAVE COME TOGETHER FOR OUR ARMENIAN JEWISH API LATINO AND LACK COMMUNITIES. I ASK THAT WE COME TOGETHER FOR A NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT TO ERECT AND MAINTAIN A STATUE OF. JUNIPERO SERRA ON THE STATE CAPITOL GROUNDS WE SHOULD BE HONORING OUR NATIVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BY REPLACING IT WITH A NEW MONUMENT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

I'M I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO FOR BRINGING THIS MATTER TO OUR ATTENTION NOW WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A CRISIS IN OVER DEBT OVERDOSE CRISIS IN OUR STATE. THROUGH OPIOID EPIDEMIC- I JUST HEARD THIS MORNING THEY THEN THENUMBER OF DEATHS WE ANTICIPATE HAPPENING IN SAN FRANCISCO THIS YEAR IS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FROM DEATHS FROM OPIOID ABUSE AND FENNEL. HAVING THESE FACILITIES MAKES SENSE BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S BECOME A POLITICAL WEDGE ISSUE THIS WILL ENABLE COMMUNITIES TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND REDUCE BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE TO THROW UP ROADBLOCKS IN PREVENTING THESE FACILITIES TO. TO BE PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT I ASK THE ARRIVAL THANK YOU. DAMOS MCCARTY MISTER GALLAGHER RECKON. YES THEY YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBER- YEAH THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AND MY DISTRICT- BECAUSE MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THOUGH HAVE A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS CAN BE DONE VERY WELL AND CAN CERTAINLY. BE HELPFUL IN GETTING PEOPLE OFF OF- DRUGS DEALING WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS CRISIS THAT'S TRUE MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVEN'T BEEN OPERATED SAFELY- AND IN THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY AND I'LL GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF THIS IN MY COMMUNITY AND ONE OF MY COMMUNITIES ALONE IN CHICO THIS WAS OPERATED AS A NEEDLE DISTRIBUTION. ROGAN NOT AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM. GIVING OUT NEEDLES THESE NEEDLES ENDED UP IN OUR PARKS AND OUR WATER WAYS IN PLACES WHERE CHILDREN PLAY. AND BECAME A HEALTH HAZARD IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT WAS ONLY BY SOMEONE BRING IN A SEQUEL LAWSUIT. THERE WAS ABLE TO STOP THIS PROGRAM FROM GOING FOR BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT GONE THROUGH. AND MITIGATED AND EVEN PLAN FOR. THE OPERATION OF THIS- PROGRAM IN THAT COMMUNITY THIS BILL TAKES AWAY THAT. ABILITY AND I KNOW WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT SEQUEL ON THIS FLOOR AND HOW IT IS AN IMPEDIMENT. TO HOUSING TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF WATER STORAGE PROJECTS. TWO SO MANY VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT WE'VE NEVER DONE A NEEDLE WE'VE NEVER DONE A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THAT. WE'VE DONE A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR ARENAS AND SPORTS STADIUMS. WE DON'T DO IT FOR THE VITAL THINGS THAT WE ALL KNOW WE NEED BUT WE'RE GONNA DO IT HERE FOR NEEDLE NEEDLE PROGRAMS. THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT. AND ALSO WHEN YOU WHEN WE HAVE EXAMPLES RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT JUST MY COMMUNITY THIS HAPPENED IN ORANGE COUNTY. THIS IS HAPPEN IN MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA WHERE. THESE PROGRAMS WERE NOT PLANNED APPROPRIATELY AND THEY DID NOT COORDINATE WITH THE COMMUNITY. A SECOND THING THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT'S NOT JUST THIS EXEMPTION HERE THAT'S GOING ON. RIGHT NOW DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS DOING EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO TAKE AWAY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ABILITY TO CONTROL NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SAY THAT THE PERMIT YOU CAN ONLY GO TO. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND GET THE PERMIT THEY HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO. THROUGH THE LOCALS SO IT'S TAKING AWAY NOW YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE DONE SAFELY. ALONG WITH HUMANELY AND SO I ASKED I ASK YOU PLEASE DO NOT GO ALONG WITH THIS BLINDLY THIS COULD CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE WE NEED SOME MORE DISCUSSION ON THIS. THIS BILL AS IT IS TODAY TO ME IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO LOCAL CONTROL AND TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE OPERATED. IN THE RIGHT WAY AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES IN ADDITION TO HELPING THOSE WHO DESPERATELY NEED NEED TO GET OFF DRUGS THANK YOU. MR COOLEY YOUR RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. COLLEAGUES THIS IS NOT A TOPPER FOR WHICH I ORDINARILY HAVE A LOT OF CONTACT. THOUGH I ACTUALLY HAVE ON MY PHONE A PHOTOGRAPH OF A TRASH CAN. IN A ROOM THAT I ENCOUNTERED ON LET'S SAY BUSINESS THAT HAD EIGHT OF. SYRINGES TUCKED AWAY IN PLACES IN THE ROOM ARE JUST ASTONISHED TO ENCOURAGE THAT SORT OF THING HERE. I DO FEEL I NEED TO JUMP UP IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND NOTE THAT. IF THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT BEING PROPERLY ADMINISTERED. THAT IS A SUBJECT MATTER FOR OVERSIGHT. TO LOOK FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND TO TIGHTEN IT UP THAT IS A SPECIFIC FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENTAL BODIES TO LOOK AT EXISTING PROGAMS. AND IF THEY'RE NOT RUNNING IN THE RIGHT WAY ADDRESS THAT. SEQUEL IS MORE OF A GATEKEEPING FUNCTION AT THE VERY OUTSET. SO A SEQUEL A REVIEW WILL NOT SHED LIGHT ON THE ULTIMATE DETAILS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF A PROGRAM. THAT IS IMPLEMENTED. SO I. PERSONALLY FEEL THAT SECRET IS MORE OF A GATEKEEPER ROLE IN ADVANCE IF THERE ARE OBJECTIONS THE ADMINISTRATION PROGRAMS WHICH ARE WELL MADE. AND I HAVE MY OWN EVIDENCE OF THE PROBLEMS OF SYRINGES- THAT'S AN OVERSIGHT FUNCTION BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL UNDERMINE AN IRISH AND I VOTE. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY SAY NO OTHER MAY.

ASSEMBLY RULE THIRTEEN OF TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK AN ACCOLADE IN THE CANNABIS DOCTOR QUIRKY MAIL. YOU SPEAKER IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE BUREAU OF CAN CAN. THE REGULATIONS TO CLARIFY A PORTION OF THE LANGUAGE ADOPTED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR WITH RESPECT TO BILLBOARD ADVERTISING. LANGUAGE IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR STATES THAT A LICENSEE SHALL NOT ADVERTISE OR MARKET ON A BILLBOARD OR SIMILAR ADVERTISING DEVICE LOCATED ON A HIGHWAY. STATE OR FEDERAL THAT CROSSES THE CALIFORNIA BORDER YEAH OF COURSE STATE HIGHWAYS DON'T CROSS THE CALIFORNIA BORDER. HOWEVER BUT THAT'S WHAT IT SAID IT WAS VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT THIS WHAT THIS MEANS BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE. I EIGHTY IN OAKLAND YOU CAN ADVERTISE ON BUT I FIVE EIGHTY YOU CAN- BASICALLY WE'VE ASKED THE LAWYERS WHO WERE IN THE ROOM THEY HAVE NO IDEA WITH THE LANGUAGE CAME FROM OR WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO DO. IN TWENTY TEN WHICH IS WITH THE BUREAU DECIDED THAT PROP SIXTY FOUR DOES NOT CLERK THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. OF JUST NOT CLARIFIED WHAT EXTENT SURE VERSION SUCH REAR PROHIBITION SHOULD TAKE PLACE AND FELT THAT A FIFTY MILE RADIUS WAS APPROPRIATE. IN TWENTY TEN THESE REGULATIONS WERE CHALLENGED THE COURTS STRUCK DOWN THE REGULATIONS. ARGUING THAT THE BUREAU- SUPERSEDED THE AUTHORITY GRANTED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR. AGAIN WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LANGUAGE WAS MEANT TO DO. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING THIS MEANS THAT ADVERTISING IS NOT ALLOWED LONG FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MILES OF INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS. INCLUDING FIVE TEN EIGHTY BUT NOT INCLUDING FIVE EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY. TWO EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY. I BECAUSE IT IS SO IT'S JUST A MESS. AB THIRTEEN OH TWO WOULD MODIFY THE REGULATIONS BUREAU DROPPED IT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND ALLOW CANNABIS LICENSES TO ADVERTISE YOUR MARKET ON A BILLBOARD ALONG THE HIGHWAY THAT IS FURTHER THAN FIFTEEN MILES RADIUS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BORDER. THE FEELING HERE WAS THAT THIS WOULD PREVENT PEOPLE FROM. SCENE THE BILLBOARD WHO FROM ANOTHER. CANNABIS ADVERTISING IS ALREADY EXTREMELY RESTRICTED CALIFORNIA STATUTE REGULATIONS SPECIFY THAT ADVERTISEMENT COULD NOT BE ATTRACTIVE ARE GEARED TOWARDS AUDIENCES UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. THIS IS POLLUTES PROHIBITION ON CARTOON CHARACTERS IMAGES OF ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE AND TOYS.

DANGER SITUATIONS ARE OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY IN OUR COMMUNITY THESE CHANGES REQUIRE MORE SAFETY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. WITH MORE PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANIES RESPONDING TO INCIDENTS ALONGSIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT THESE HEROES NEED FURTHER PROTECTION FROM HARM. COLLEAGUES THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT THE PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANIES RECOGNIZE THREATS OUR PARAMEDIC SPACE AND PROVIDE THE NECESSARY PROTECTION FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES IT IS NOT RIGHT TO ASK THEM TO PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES. IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SAY ARE. SAYING NOBODY DISK. OR DEBATE ON THE ADAM. CLARK LOW THE ROLE.

THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC ANY AMENDMENTS TO. THAT I BELIEVE WILL MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. WE'RE GONNA START DOING MAIL BALLOTS ON EVERY ELECTION WE ALSO NEED TO HELP INSURE BOTH ACCESS AND INTEGRITY. OF THE ELECTIONS PROCESS- SO THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ONE REPEAL THE EXISTING LAW THAT ALLOWS ANY PERSON. INCLUDING POLITICAL OPERATIVES TO RETURN VOTERS BBM BALLOTS. AND PROVIDES INSTEAD THE ONLY FAMILY MEMBERS AND ROOMMATES OF VOTERS MAY RETURN THERE- VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT- WHICH BY THE WAY WAS THE LAW UNTIL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN- NUMBER TWO THIS DELETES LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. THAT WOULD ALLOW ELECTION OFFICIALS TO COUNTY BOARD VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS THAT ARRIVE UP TO SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION AND INSTEAD MAKE IT THREE DAYS WHICH WAS AND HAS BEEN- THE ELECTION LAW. AND THEN THIRTY CLARIFIES THAT ELECTIONS OFFICIALS SHALL NOT MAIL VOTE BY. VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS TO VOTERS WITH AN AN ACTIVE REGISTRATION STATUS AND WE SAW THAT IN THIS LAST ELECTION MANY BALLOTS WENT OUT TO PEOPLE WHO HAD ALREADY MOVED. HAD MOVED TO DIFFERENT COUNTIES A MOVE TO DIFFERENT STATES. IN MANY CASES- AND SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT BALLOTS ARE ONLY GOING TO ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTERS SO THE IS A REASONABLE COMMONSENSE. AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE MAIL BALLOT PROCESS. I IN THE FUTURE AND I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORT. FOR THESE REASONABLE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. THIS RACE.

NOW TO THE AND SHE- CORKERY. ASSEMBLY THIRTY SEVEN BY SOME MEMBER FIRM AND- OTHERS ENACT TO A LOT. THIS BERMAN YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND TO PER BOTH VOTERS POLL WORKERS LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AB EIGHT SIXTY WHICH WAS A SUCCESSFUL BIPARTISAN REGISTERED VOTER A BALLOT AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS ACCORDING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE OVER EIGHTY SIX POINT 5% OF THE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION VOTED ON THE BALLOT THAT WAS MAILED TO THEM. DATA SHOWS THAT SENDING EVERYONE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL PROVIDES VOTERS ACCESS AND WHEN VOTERS GET BALLOTS IN THE MAIL THEY VOTE SB THIRTY SEVEN WILL MAKE SOME OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS PERMANENT ENSURING THAT EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTERS MAIL THE BALLOT FOR EVERY ELECTION SIMILAR TO PROVISIONS IN MY EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY LAST YEAR SB THIRTY SEVEN MAKES A NUMBER OF IMPORTS OTHER IMPORTANT FACILITATE VOTING BY MAIL IN FUTURE ELECTIONS IT ALLOWS COUNTIES TO BEGIN PROCESSING A RETURN VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS EARLIER. SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER MANAGE THEIR WORKLOAD TO GET MORE BALLOTS COUNTED ON ELECTION NIGHT AND ALSO EXTENDS THE DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS SO THAT VOTERS ARE NOT DISENFRANCHISED BY POTENTIAL POSTAL SERVICE% DELAYS SB THIRTY SEVEN ALSO ENSURES VOTERS CONTRACT THEIR BALLOTS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE MAIL SYSTEM INTERPROCESS BY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS BERMAN. MISTER SAY ARE TELL YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. REQUEST A FEW WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE- IN THE LAST TWO ELECTIONS WE HAD SPECIAL ELECTION. ONE IN DISTRICT SEVENTY NINE WONDER DISTRICT FIFTY FOUR. DISTRICT SEVENTY NINE PRODUCED 21% OF THE VOTERS THEY'RE ALL MAIL BALLOTS THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF MAIL BALLOTS SENT OUT. AND THOSE BALLOTS COST TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS APIECE TO SEND OUT. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE BASICALLY WITH. WHERE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE THESE NUMBERS. IS FOR- FOR THE SEVENTY NINE TH DISTRICT. SEVENTY NINE OUT OF A HUNDRED BALLOTS GOT THROWN IN THE TRASH. THAT MEANS THAT MEANS. CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS WENT DIRECTLY IN THE TRASH. FOR THE FIFTY FOURTH DISTRICT IT WAS EVEN WORSE. IT WAS 14% 14% THAT MEANS. EIGHTY SIX OF A HUNDRED BALLOTS WENT IN THE TRASH THAT'S OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. SO IT APPEARS THAT WHILE THIS MAY WORK WELL IN SOME ELECTIONS IT DOESN'T WORK WELL IN OTHERS AND SO IF WE WANT TO REFORM. THIS BALLOT ALSO IN ORDER TO GIVE PEOPLE GREATER ACCESS IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THIS IS THE ONLY ANSWER AND WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO PUT A COMMISSION TOGETHER STUDY THIS FIGURE OUT WHAT WILL CREATE A MORE JUST AND IN A BETTER SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE. AND AND THEN ENACT LAWS THAT WILL DO THAT. BECAUSE THIS PIECEMEAL APPROACH IS NOT WORKING. IT IS NOT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS BEING RETURNED IN THESE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BALLOTS AFTER HOUSE THEY COULDN'T MARK ONE SPOT AND SEND IT IN. SO THAT IS NOT ACCESS TO BALLOTING IS NOT THE PROBLEM HERE. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT MORE CAREFULLY FIND OT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. AND FIX THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS. MR GALLAGHER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERY BRIEFLY IF WE WANT TO DO THIS IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER THE SAME WAY THAT WE DID LAST. LAST YEAR. THEN WE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BIPARTISAN INPUT. AND I THINK WHAT WE WANT HERE IS AN ELECTION SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES GREATER ACCESS AND ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO. GET THEIR VOTE IN AND MAIL BALLOT DOES THAT. BUT ALSO ENSURING THE INTEGRITY. OF THE VOTING HAVING REASONABLE PROTECTIONS AGAINST THAT SUCH AS INACTIVE VOTERS. ET YOU KNOW GETTING SENT BALLOTS- SO I DON'T. WITHOUT THESE READ AMENDMENTS I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS AS A BIPARTISAN. PROCESS FOR MOVING FORWARD AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE THANK YOU. MR BERMAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM MURRIETA. ABOUT POTENTIAL WASTE IN ELECTIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO STOP THIS RECALL THIS UNNECESSARY RECALL FROM HAPPENING. WHICH IS GOING TO WASTE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER MONEY. ON A RECALL FOR SOMEBODY WHO WILL BE ON THE BALLOT THE NEXT YEAR I TOTALLY. IN UNNECESSARY WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO MY FRIEND FOR YUBA CITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO CALIFORNIANS I WANNA APOLOGIZE TO CALIFORNIA VOTERS I KNOW. TOO MANY OF THEM. HAVE LOST FAITH IN OUR ELECTION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN LIED TO. THEY HAVE BEEN LIED TO INCESSANTLY THEY WERE LIED TO BY FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THEY WERE LIED TO BY FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS THEY WERE LIED TO BY SOME PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING. ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY. IN THE WORLD AND IT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA KNOWS THAT WHEN THEY VOTE THEIR VOTE IS COUNTED. AND THAT OUR ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE SECURE WE CANNOT. PASS LEGISLATION AND PASS POLICIES BASED ON LIES WE CANNOT UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY AND AN INCREASE VOTER SUPPRESSION LIKE THEY'RE DOING IT TOO MANY STATES. ACROSS THE COUNTRY BASED ON LIES AND I KNOW. I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES DO NOT LET LIES IMPACT THE POLICIES THAT WE PASSED IN THIS BUILDING WE NEED TO MAKE IT.

THANK AYE SALAS SENIOR. OR DEBATE MISTER KILEY IS WAY AT ME. MR KILEY ARE. IN THE REAR OF CHAMBER. I THANK MISTER SPEAKER I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS I THINK THE MEASURES- WILL HELP I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH GOOD THERE ARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO DO BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO PAUSE FOR A SECOND AND JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROCESS THAT HAS GOTTEN US YEAR. AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR OF ABJECT FAILURE AT THE EDT WE EVENTUALLY GET A STATE AUDIT WHICH EVENTUALLY PRODUCES SOME RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH IS ARE NOW BEING- IMPLEMENTED OR BEING CODIFIED THROUGH AN ACTIVE LEGISLATION AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE EDT IT'S REALLY BORING THE LINE BETWEEN LEGISLATION AND MANAGEMENT THE WAY THAT IT OUGHT TO WORK IS THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE. LEGISLATIVE GOALS FOR THE TIMELY AND- ACCURATE DELIVERY OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND WE OUGHT TO PROVIDE OUR STATE AGENCIES WITH THE TOOLS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT BUT THE STATE AUDITOR IN OUR HEARING ON THIS ISSUE. I SAID THAT THE MANAGEMENT AT THAT AGENCY IS A PART OF THE PROBLEM AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE HAVE AN OUTDATED CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM- WITH. MANY. OTHER RISK. LAYERED ON. PEOPLE WHO ARE THRIVING TO TERMINATE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THEIR JOBS TO PAY PEOPLE MORE IF THEY'RE TAKING ON MORE RESPONSIBILITY TO. CONTRACT WITH THE BEST PROVIDERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT'S WHAT IT'LL TAKE TO HAVE A MORE MODERN- AND EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT STATE BUREAUCRACY AND THE FACT IS WITH THE AMOUNT OF WEALTH AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND TALENT THAT OUR STATE HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL THERE IS SIMPLY NO REASON THAT CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE TO SETTLE FOR SUBSTANDARD SERVICE. MISS VALLADARES YOUR RECORD MEMBERS I RISE TODAY AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB FIFTY SIX SINCE I WAS SWORN IN AT NEARLY A THOUSAND ONE THOUSAND CONSTITUENTS HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME TO HELP WITH THEIR EDT CLAIMS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR OVER A MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED AND UNABLE TO RECEIVE A MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING THE REASON IS SIMPLE WE HAVE A BLOATED INSUFFICIENT AND COMPLETELY MISSED MANAGEMENT MISMANAGED GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT IS INCAPABLE OF SELF REFORM. THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT A TASK FORCE THAT CAME BACK WITH NO SIGNIFICANT OR DRASTIC REFORMS EITHER AND GUESS WHAT. THE PROBLEM GOT WORSE NOT BETTER. MEMBERS IT IS WHY IT IS WAY PAST TIME THAT WE START HOLDING EDT ACCOUNTABLE THE LIVELIHOODS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE AT STAKE AB FIFTY SIX MAKES COMMONSENSE REFORMS TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK IMAGE RATHER. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS YES MS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU- MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS A PROUD JOINT AUTHORS ON THE BILL I THINK THAT ALL OF THESE EDIE REFORMS THAT WERE PASSING THROUGH ARE NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT- OBVIOUSLY IN MY OFFICE WE'VE HELPED OVER SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE LAST YEAR ON IT WITH EDT AND I KNOW ALL OF OUR STAFF. ARE WORKING HARD I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH I WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK AT EDT. REALIZE WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THEY ARE DOING THIS IS NOT THEIR FAILURE IT IS A FAILURE OF A SYSTEM IT IS A FAILURE OF. US IT IS A FAILURE OF THE STATE BUT THOSE WORKERS GO TO WORK EVERY DAY WORK EXTREMELY HARD. THAT THAT EDT IN GENERAL IS UNDER STAFFED NOT BLOATED NOT OVERSTAFFED IN WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE RECOGNIZING THE HARD WRK OF OUR STATE EMPLOYEES AS WELL IN WITHOUT AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION.

HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE NINE MINUTE TWENTY NINE SECONDS VIDEO OF THE POLICE OFFICER WITH HIS KNEE ON GEORGE FLOYD'S KNACK. WE WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. TALKING ABOUT MAKING ETHNIC STUDIES A GRADUATION REQUIREENT FOR ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THE MORE THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD. LIKE THE MURDER OF EMMETT TEEL SIXTY SIX YEARS AGO. FOREVER CHANGE THE WAY THAT MANY AMERICANS LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY AND THIS COUNTRY'S PAST HISTORY. AS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE MARCHED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. DECLARING THE BLACK LIVES MATTER. CALLING FOR JUSTICE AND POLICE REFORM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. ORGANIZED IN GROUPS LIKE CHEN UP. AND DEBT DIVERSIFY OUR NARRATIVE RAISE THEIR VOICES DEMANDING MORE THAN JUST THE SAME EUROCENTRIC CURRICULUM. THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ALWAYS TAUGHT. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TODAY LIKE YOUNG CHICANO STUDENTS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHO WALKED OUT OF THERE HE'S STILL A HIGH SCHOOL. WANT TO SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN HISTORY NOVELS POETRY DRAMA THAT IS TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL. AFTER MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE FIELD OR DISCIPLINE OF ETHNIC STUDIES OUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PAST IS MUCH RICHER. BUT WE INSIST ON TEACHING THE SAME OLD EURO CENTRIC. CURRICULUM. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE HEARD COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE HAD TO WAIT TILL THEY GOT TO COLLEGE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR OWN HISTORY. AND CULTURE. LAST WEEK IN AN ARTICLE IN THE HILL. TITLED SPIKE IN ANTI ASIAN HATE. COULD LEAD TO COULD LEAD TO SYSTEMIC CHANGE IN SCHOOLS. DR LOUIS ONE A PROFESSOR AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LAMENTED. HOW MANY STUDENTS COME TO HER CLASSROOM AND READ ASIAN AMERICAN LITERATURE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES. AND SON START THE CLASS AND AWARE. OF THE HISTORICAL EVENTS. SUCH AS THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT FOR JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMPS. DR WON SAID THAT THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IS WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY AMERICANS TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE MANY IS SO DENSE OF VIOLENCE THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY WITNESSED. IT'S TIME WE LISTEN. TO THE VOICES OF OUR STUDENTS. AND TO THE PROFESSORS CALLING FOR ETHNIC STUDIES. I ASK YOU TO VOTE HI ON AB ONE OH ONE. TO REQUIRE HIGH SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE ETHNIC STUDIES BEGINNING IN ACADEMIC YEAR.

REMEMBER IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. MEMBERS ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR MEDINA MISTER DAVID CHIU YOUR RECOGNITION THE REAR. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY IS A PROUD JOIN AUTHOR OF AB ONE A ONE AND LET ME START BY THANKING THE DOCKET LEADERSHIP OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE CHAIR. FOR API COMMUNITIES ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES HAVE BEEN CRITICAL TO DISPELLING THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH AND OTHER STEREOTYPES. ALLOWED US TO SHARE THE INCREDIBLE SPECTRUM OF EXPERIENCES WITHIN OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES EDUCATED THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIANS IN THE HISTORY OF STRUGGLES THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE GRAPPLE WITH. ETHNIC STUDIES HAVE INTRODUCED NEW PERSPECTIVES HAVE HELP STUDENTS DEVELOP CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS HAVE HAD A LASTING AND DEMONSTRATED POSITIVE ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT ON STUDENTS. AND I WOULD SAY LIKE MANY OF US ON THIS FLOOR. THESE ARE DISCIPLINES THAT HAVE SHAPED WHO I AM. I WOULD HAVE BECOME AN ACTIVIST A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY A RUN FOR OFFICE IF I HAD NOT LEARNED ABOUT THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT AND JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT OR THE MURDER VINCENTIAN. AND DURING THIS TIME PERIOD OF ANTI ASIAN HATE. IT DEMONSTRATES HOW IMPORTANT THIS EDUCATION S. HOW NECESSARY IT IS IT'S NOT OPTIONAL IT'S NECESSARY. FOR REPEALING THE MULTI ETHNIC FOR REPAIRING THE MULTI ETHNIC SOCIAL FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY. IN OUR DIVERSE STATE THIS BILL IS THE NEXT STEP. TO MORE INCLUSIVE SOCIETY ONE THAT IS REFLECTIVE AND SUPPORTIVE OF STUDENTS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND COMMUNITIES IN WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER RAMOS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A PROUD- PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL OF ETHNIC STUDIES IS NEEDED IN PARTICULARLY TO THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN- PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO RISE. AS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TEACH THE HISTORIES OF VARIOUS CULTURES AND THE PEOPLE THAT CONSTITUTE OUR GREAT STATE. IN RECENT TIMES ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE EXPERIENCE THE VENTS TO SHOW US HOW LITTLE WE ALL UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE FRUSTRATIONS AND INEQUITIES OF OUR STATE AND COUNTRY. VERY LITTLE IS TAUGHT ABOUT CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS IN OUR STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM THE LITTLE INFORMATION THAT IS TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOMS ABOUT NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS PRIMARILY INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. AND ONE IN PARTICULAR CASE THAT WE WENT THROUGH HERE IN THE PANDEMIC SOME OF THAT INFORMATION OF HESITANCY FOR OUR ELDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE VACCINE WAS DUE TO PAST TREATMENT OF THOSE HERE IN THE STATE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT MOVED FORWARD AS LATE AS THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. ON THE STERILIZATION PROCESS TOWARDS THE NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN NOT ONLY IN THE NATION BUT ALSO HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THESE TYPES OF EDUCATION IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET IN FRONT OF THOSE IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS BY SUPPORTING AB ONE OH ONE AND ETHNIC STUDIES WE START TO MOVE THAT PENDULUM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO START TO TEACH THE TRUE AND FCTUAL ACCOUNTS OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE I URGE AND I VOTE FOR AB ONE OH ONE. THANK YOU MYSTERON US MR KILEY HERE RECOGNITION THE REAR CHAMBER. WHEN THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE- CURRICULUM- THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO MAKE A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT WAS RELEASED IT WAS UNIVERSALLY CONDEMNED- THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE THIS IS FOURTEEN. MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE I WROTE A LETTER SAYING THAT IT ECHOES THE PROPAGANDA OF THE **** REGIME. ECHOES THE PROPAGANDA. OF THE OUR RESPONSE WOULD BE TO IMMEDIATELY SCRAP THE WHOLE THING AND BRING ACCOUNTABILITY TO WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AFTER ALL PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS THEIR CAREERS FOR THINGS FAR LESS SERIOUS THAN TRYING TO TEACH **** PROPAGANDA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. INSTEAD WE SAID OKAY WE'LL MAKE A FEW TWEAKS WILL MAKE A FEW EDITS WILL TONE DOWN THE **** PROPAGANDA AND THEN ONE POSE THIS ON EVERY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. IN CALIFORNIA. THE INADEQUACY OF THIS RESPONSE IS REFLECTED. IN THE CONTINUING OPPOSITION OF JEWISH AMERICAN GROUPS EVEN ON THE FOURTH VERSION OF THE CURRICULUM THE ALTERNATIVE. FOR EXAMPLE SAYS THAT IN A TIME WHEN ANTI JEWISH SENTIMENT HOSTILITY AND VIOLENCE HAS REACHED TRULY ALARMING LEVELS. THIS BILL IS TANTAMOUNT TO PUTTING AN EVEN LARGER TARGET ON THE BACK OF EVERY JEWISH STUDENT. BUT THE ANTISEMITISM. IS JUST ONE MANIFESTATION OF WHAT IS SO FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. WITH THIS PROPOSED CURRICULUM. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE EXCLUSION OF GROUPS THE DENIGRATION OF GROUPS. IT'S THAT SEEKS TO IMPOSE A PARTICULAR WORLD VIEW ON STUDENTS RATHER THAN GIVING THE ANALYTICAL AND CRITICAL THINKING TOOLS TO CONSTRUCT THEIR IDENTITY FOR THEMSELVES. AND I PARTICULARLY OBJECT TO THE NOTION THIS CURRICULUM IS SOMEHOW IN SERVICE OF EQUITY. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT EQUITY IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORST ACHIEVEMENT GAPS IN THE COUNTRY ALONG RACIAL LINES ALONG SOCIO ECONOMIC LINES. BEFORE COVE IT EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WAS FORTY NINTH AT A FIFTY WAS CALIFORNIA STANDING COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND THE SITUATION WAS SO BAD THAT YOU HAD A LAWSUIT BROUGHT. BY STUDENTS AGAINST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR VIOLATING THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. BASED UPON THEM NOT BEING TAUGHT HOW TO READ THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SETTLED THAT LAWSUIT. FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. I CAN SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE FIRSTHAND. I TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES I THOUGHT TENTH GRADERS AND WHEN MY TENTH GRADERS GOT TO MY CLASSROOM THE AVERAGE READING LEVEL. WAS FIFTH GRADE. WHEN I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE. MY BIGGEST PRIORITY WAS TO FIGHT FOR TRUE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. YET EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE TO EXPAND EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN SNUFFED OUT. BY THE MOST POWERFUL SPECIAL INTEREST IT IS CAPITAL. WHOSE BUSINESS MODEL IS TO KEEP KIDS TRAPPED IN FAILING SCHOOLS. AND OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT BUSINESS MODEL HAS BECOME KEEPING KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL ALTOGETHER. MISTER MCCARTY PLEASE STAGE FOR ORDER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER CAN WE HAVE THE OPPONENT TO THIS MEASURE SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL AND NOT GET SIDETRACKED THINKING. MR MCCARTY THE POINT IS WELL TAKEN. THIS READ MR KILEY PLEASE CONFINE YOUR COMMENTS TO THE MERITS OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT IS BEFORE THE BODY. YOU MAY PROCEED. THE CONSEQUENCES AS FAR AS EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. WERE WELL UNDERSTOOD IN ADVANCE RICHARD ROTHSTEIN AUTHOR OF THE COLOR OF LAW A FORGOTTEN HISTORY OF HOW OUR GOVERNMENT SEGREGATED. SAID THE CLOSING SCHOOLS WILL TAKE EXISTING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MIDDLE CLASS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND EXPLODES EXPLODE. AND YET THERE'S A STILL MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE. AS CURRICULUM LIKE THIS CURRICULA LIKE THIS ARE BEING PROPOSED NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL. IN SOME CASES THEIR WELL INTENDED ANOTHER CASES THEY'RE NOT. BUT IN ALL CASES. IT IS EXPLOITING WHAT I BELIEVE IS A VOID. THAT HAS COME TO EXIST IN PUBLIC EDUCATION NOT JUST IN THE STATE BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT IS WE'VE LOST TOUCH. WITH WHAT EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE UNIFYING THREAD. OF EDUCATION THIRTY SECONDS. YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE CITIZENS TO BE ACTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. THAT'S WHAT BOUND EDUCATION TOGETHER IT WAS THE LINCHPIN OF SELF GOVERNMENT BILL WE DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT EDUCATION THAT WAY ANYMORE AND SO I THINK A CURRICULUM LIKE THIS IS COMING ALONG. AND IS TRYING TO FILL THAT VOID IT'S LIKE THE ANTI CIVICS. RATHER THAN HAVING THE UNIFYING THREAD OF EDUCATION THE BUILDING COMMUNITIES UP IT'S TEARING COMMUNITIES DOWN SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE TODAY. AND WE NEED TO HAVE A RENEWAL IN THIS STATE OF THE TRUE CIVIC PURPOSE OF EDUCATION THANK YOU. MICHIGAN APRIL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IS TEARING THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS MAYBE JUST TO HELP SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT A LITTLE BIT WANT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COLLEAGUES FROM- COMMENTS FROM A COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKLAND WASN'T PLANNING TO SPEAK TODAY BUT- JUST WANT TO HELP CORRECT A FEW THINGS SO FIRST- ON BEHALF OF THE EIGHTEEN MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. WANT TO KNOW THAT EVERY MEMBER OF OUR CAUCUS SUPPORTED THIS BILL LAST YEAR. NOW THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE THAT ARE BEING CONFLATED. THERE WAS A MODEL CURRICULUM IN INITIAL DRAFT OF WHICH CAME OUT THAT ARE CAUCUS OBJECTED TO. THERE ARE SOME VERY DEEPLY BIGOTED MATERIAL IN THAT. INFORMATION SONG LYRICS ABOUT HOW JEWS CONTROLLING MANIPULATE THE MEDIA THINGS THAT OUR COMMUNITY. FOUND ABSOLUTELY UNTENABLE BUT WE WORKED WE CAME TO THE TABLE WE ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THERE WAS A ROBUST PROCESS THAT THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION. APPROVED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION WE HAD THERE WAS VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER THAT SAID THAT. THE PEOPLE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION LIKE OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE DR SHIRLEY WEBER. PRAISE THAT THAT THE LORD SWEAR TO PRAISE THAT LEADERS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY STOOD UP AND PRAISED. NOW THERE ARE VOICES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY SOME THAT THAT ARE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES THAT STILL. HAVE OBJECTIONS TO IT. BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF JEWISH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE LARGER MEMBERSHIP THAT SPEAK FOR OUR COMMUNITY. ARE PROUD OF WHAT'S IN THE MODEL CURRICULUM. THEY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT INCLUDES LESSON PLANS ON ON THE JEWISH AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. WE APPRECIATE THE APPROACH THAT IT TAKES. AND SO WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY I WANT TO COMMEND. THE AUTHOR FOR THE SENSITIVE WAY THAT HE HAS HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT SOMEONE UP COMMAND A LOT OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO COME UP AND ASK ME ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE THESE ARE THE KIND OF TOUCH THINGS THAT CAN START OUT AND USUALLY BE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS. BUT I THINK WITH THE MODEL CURRICULUM WE HAVE SET THIS IN A DIRECTION THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT. SO WHAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK IS THAT IF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE JEWISH COMMUNITIES OUT IN THE JEWISH CAUCUSES THAT COME TALK TO US. WE DON'T NEED ANYBODY TO SPEAK FOR US WE CAN SPEAK FOR OURSELVES AND SO WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISS GABRIEL. DR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB ONE OH ONE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I WAS TAUGHT THAT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS DISCOVERED AMERICA. AND THAT THE ONLY THING SIGNIFICANT AND BLACK HISTORY WAS THE I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH GIVEN BY MARTHA KING JUNIOR. I HOWEVER WAS FORTUNATE THAT BOTH OF MY PARENTS WERE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT BLACK HISTORY. SO I LEARNED MY HISTORY FROM THEM AND FROM THE MANY HOURS I SPENT AS A CHILD SITTING IN MY MOTHER'S BLACK STUDIES CLASSES AT SENEGAL STATE UNIVERSITY. KNOWING WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR HISTORY IS IMPORTANT AND HOW YOU SEE YOURSELF AND YOUR PLACE IN THIS WORLD. CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST DIVERSE STATE IN THIS NATION AND OUR KIDS SEE EVERY DAY THE DIFFERENT RACIAL AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS FROM WHICH THEIR FRIENDS CLASSMATES AND TEAMMATES COME FROM. THROUGH ETHNIC STUDIES ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE ACCURATE INFORMATION BASED ON CURRENT AND CONFIRMED RESEARCH THAT MAY HELP EXPLAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SOME CASES THE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS FROM WHICH THEIR FRIENDS COME FROM. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND THOSE DIFFERENCES. BUT ALSO CELEBRATE AND EMBRACE THEM. AT THE MOST ONE OF THE MOST FORMATIVE TIMES IN THEIR LIVES. WITH TODAY'S VOTE WE WILL BEGIN TO CHART A NEW COURSE FOR OUR KIDS ONE OF INCLUSIVITY AND ACCEPTANCE. PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT STATED THE MORE YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PAST THE BETTER PREPARED YOU ARE FOR THE FUTURE. MEMBERS LET US PREPARE OUR CHILDREN FOR A BETTER FUTURE BY EMPOWERING THEM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF THEIR CLASSMATES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB ONE OH ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER. MISS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU IRATE RICE AS A MATH TEACHER FOR THIRTEEN YEARS- BUT THEIR CREDENTIAL AND A LOT OF PRACTICE- IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAY WE WERE IN THE CLASSROOM TO SPEAK FOR ALL TO YOURSELF THERE. BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS I WAS A MATH TEACHER BUT I KNOW THIS MIGHT SAID OF MY STUDENTS SAW. THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THEIR SCHOOLS THEY WOULD'VE BEEN MUCH MORE EXCITED TO COME TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH RIGHT HAD IT TO DO THE WORK THAT WE ASK THEM TO DO OUT THERE. WHEN WE TEACH THEM ABOUT THEIR HISTORY TEACHER ABOUT THEIR STRENGTH WITH THE TIME ABOUT THE RESILIENCY WE TEACH THEM ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN STRUGGLING AND THAT THIS WITH ONCE OUR LAND. ANYTHING THAT PRIDE IS WHAT WE MIGHT BE TO CARRY FORWARD IN pTHERE. AND SO IF WE'RE GONNA STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MATH AS WE ELEVATES THEM OUT THERE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TEACH IN THIS HISTORY AND THAT THEY SEE. THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY WE NEED OXYGEN THE UGLY SO THAT WE DON'T WE PEOPLE'S TALENTS AS THEY GET OUT THERE. AND SO AS A TEACHER I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS CURRICULUM IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO OUR STUDENTS OUT THERE. YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAPPEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS IN ALL SUBJECT MATTERS IT'S TIME IT'S LONGER WE DO THAT WE DO. THIS SINCE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL. THANK YOU MS GARCIA. MS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A PROUD JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. AND I HAVE TO SAY I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN AND EVERY SINGLE YEAR WE'VE HAD A BILL A PRIORITY BILL THE LATINO CAUCUS. TO TRY TO MANDATE ETHNIC STUDIES IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL. AND EVERY YEAR WE'VE BEEN TOLD NOW. MOST OF US AREN'T SURPRISED BECAUSE MOST OF THE LATINO CAUCUS AT SOME POINT LEARNED OUR HISTORY AND REALIZE THAT'S NOT SO UNCOMMON. THERE WERE OFTEN TOLD NO THEY WERE OFTEN MISREPRESENTED THAT OUR POSITIONS ARE OFTEN MISREPRESENTED BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT COME FROM A BACKGROUND. AND SO WE PERSIST AND SO THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PERSISTING IF I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING I TO BELIEVE. THAT WE SHOULD GIVE STUDENTS A CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS TO CONSTRUCT THEIR IDENTITY THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. BUT YOU CANNOT CONSTRUCT YOUR IDENTITY IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR HISTORY. AND I WENT TO A SCHOOL LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO ALSO IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. ON STOLEN LAND FROM THE COOLEY I NEVER LEARNING THT. ON LAND THAT WAS THEN BELONGING TO THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO BUT BEING TOLD BY TEACHERS. THAT MY FATHER WAS AN ILLEGAL ALIEN IT DIDN'T BELONG HERE IN NEVER BEING TOLD THAT THIS WAS ONCE THE COUNTRY HE CAME FROM. THESE ARE REAL THINGS THAT STUDENTS GO THROUGH. AND WE KNOW NOT ONLY LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES STATED THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT HER STUDENTS WOULD DO BETTER WITH ETHNIC STUDIES BUT A TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDYING ARE STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROVED. THAT AT RISK STUDENTS WERE LESS LIKELY DROP OUT INCREASE THEIR MTH AND SCIENCE SCORES IF THEY HAD ETHNIC STUDIES. TELL PEOPLE THEY'RE WORTH LET THEM LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY OF STRUGGLE AND OVERCOMING STRUGGLE LET THEM APPRECIATE WHERE THEY ARE AND HOW WE GOT HERE AND THEY WILL DO BETTER IN SCHOOL STUDIES PROVE IT. IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT FOR SEVEN YEARS WE SAT ON THE FLOOR AND ARGUED ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES. IN IT SHAMEFUL THAT IT'S BECOME WEAPONIZED IN A WAY THAT WE SAW TODAY AND WE SEE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND WE SAW BY A PREVIOUS PRESIDENT'S. BECAUSE OUR STORIES MATTER. IN REAL HISTORY SHOULD BE TAUGHT THIS ISN'T EVEN ABOUT SOME SPECIAL CATEGORICAL HISTORY THIS IS THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES IT IS THE TRUTH AND WHY WOULD WE EVER FIGHT TEACHING CHILDREN. ABOUT THE TRUTH ABOUT HISTORY. WHETHER IT'S TALKING ABOUT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS IN THE FEET THREE FIFTHS COMPROMISE THAT THAT SAID THAT BLACK INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT WORTHY OF A FULL PERSON AT A FULL VOTE OR THEIR WHETHER TALKING ABOUT OUR BEAUTIFUL CATALINA ISLAND WHICH BY A TREATY ACTUALLY TODAY STILL BELONGS TO MEXICO BUT WAS TAKEN. BY CAPITALIST WHO DECIDED HE COULD PURCHASE IT. THAT IS THE TRUTH IT'S HISTORY. IT'S NOT JUDGMENTAL IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LEARN AND OUR KIDS AND OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO LEARN IT NOT EVERY STUDENT PUBLIC SCHOOL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM SAN DIEGO. I DIDN'T HAVE THAT BENEFIT TO SIT THROUGH ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS IN COLLEGE I DID HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A MOTHER WHO CARED SO DEEPLY ABOUT ME UNDERSTANDING MY HISTORY THAT SHE DID HER BEST TO TEACH ME DESPITE. HAVING NEVER TAKEN ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS HERSELF. BUT WHEN I GOT STANFORD AND I WAS ABLE TO TAKE COURSES THAT SPECIFICALLY TALK TO THE HISTORY OF MY PEOPLE OF MY IMMIGRANT FATHER OF MY MOTHER OF MY CLASSMATES AND MY COLLEAGUES. AWAKENING THAT CAUSES AN A STUDENT TO WANT TO LEARN MORE. TOOK TO DESIRE TO CHANGE THINGS TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. IS SECOND TO NONE. I HOPE PEOPLE WILL REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT THIS DISCUSSION IS. NOT JUST TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT TO ALL COMMUNITIES TO LEARN TRUE HISTORY I HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHY ANYONE. WOULD NOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL I WOULD NOT VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE. THANK YOU IN SCHEDULES MYSTERY THIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IN IS A VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL ONE A ONE WHICH IS A PRIORITY BILL OF OUR CAUCUS. AND I THINK MANY OF US WOULD AGREE THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL IMPROVE IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE. THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION WE DELIVER TO OUR STUDENTS. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT OUR STUDENTS BE AFFORDED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY. THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND LEADERS. THAT CALL CALIFORNIA HOME. LEARNING ABOUT UR DIVERSE POPULATIONS INCREASES OUR EMPATHY AS PEOPLE. AND HELPS TO FOSTER A MORE EQUAL IN JUST COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY WITH THE RECENT CIVIL UNREST WE'VE EXPERIENCED. THE RISE IN HATE CRIMES THIS LEGISLATION WILL PROVIDE OUR SCHOOLS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOSTER FUTURE GENERATIONS OF LEADERS THAT EMBRACE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY. AND AS WE KNOW NO BILL NO BILL IS PERFECT AND THIS BILL THE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF IT HAD BEEN DEBATED FOR YEARS. AND THIS CURRENT BILL IS A GREAT DEAL. S. R. LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND YEARS OF INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS FROM OF LEGISLATORS FORMER AND PRESENT. HAVE MADE IT A GREAT BILL. THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL ARE CALLING FROM RIVERSIDE IS AN EXPERT ON THIS ISSUE. HAVING SPENT OVER THIRTY YEARS IN EDUCATION. TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES. OUR COLLEAGUE RIVERSIDE UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE HE'S BEEN A CHAMPION FOR STUDENTS HIS ENTIRE CAREER. AND HAS SEE HOW ETHNIC STUDIES CAN ENRICH THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH HIM PROUD TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL ONE A ONE AND REGION AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I THINK IT WAS RIVAS MR COOLEY. IN THE REAR CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I'M VERY PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND- I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT IT'S A RED LETTER DAY FOR ME AS A DEMOCRAT BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST TIME- USE A WERE OFTEN HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THE FOR OF THIS CHAMBER. EXISTENTIAL EXISTENCE RELATIONS EXIST AS WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE. BUT THERE IS NO GRAVER CHALLENGE ACROSS THE GLOBE. THEN THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE. TO LOOK AT OTHERS NOT LIKE THEM WITH EMPATHY. WITH RESPECT WITH UNDERSTANDING. WE ARE SEEING THIS THIS IS THE MOMENT A HISTORY WHICH WERE STANDARD WHERE WE HAVE BROADENED CONNECTIONS THE GLOW. BUT WHAT WE SEE IS A GREAT OUTPOURING OF HOSTILITY AND DIVISION FOCUSED ON DIFFERENCES. AND YES OUR GLOBAL. OPPONENTS FOMENT THIS USING ONLINE TOOLSOTHER SORTS OF THINGS THIS IS A PROFOUND IRAQ. FOR THE EXPERIMENT IN DEMOCRACY THE START WITH OUR NATION. TO SEE HOW IT WILL END DOOR IN AN ERA OF SUCH DIVISION OF SUCH HOSTILITY OF SUCH A READINESS TO CASTIGATE AND DENIGRATE. OTHERS WHO MAY BE DIFFERENT. I THINK FOR US IN CALIFORNIA A GLOBAL. NATION STATE. TO STAND ON BEHALF OF PROMOTING AN UNDERSTANDING AND EMPATHY. IT IS INDEED A RESPONSE TO WHAT IS A PROFOUND ACCIDENTAL STRESS EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO DEMOCRACY AND IF I MAY BRING IT HOME SEVERAL DECADES AGO. RON THE TIME OF MY CITY FORMED. RANCHO CORDOVA WAS IDENTIFIED BASED ON THE U. S. CENSUS AS THE MOST RAPIDLY DIVERSIFYING COMMUNITY AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA LITTLE WRENCH OVER OVER HERE AND CHECK ON A COUNTY WHERE I LIVE WHERE MY KIDS GREW UP. AND I KNOW THAT MY HIGH SCHOOLERS BECAUSE WE WOULD TALK ABOUT THIS. FELT THAT. THEY WERE ALWAYS HAPPY WITH THE EDUCATION THEY GOT THEY HAD GRIPES ABOUT THE SCHOOLS BUT THEY TOTALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE BETTER EQUIPPED TO GO INTO THE WORKFORCE IN THE MODERN WORLD. BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD HOW TO LIVE WITH DIFFERENCES TO RESPECT OTHERS TO FUNCTION AMID DIVERSITY. SO I FEEL THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL A VERY IMPORTANT UNDERTAKING FOR CALIFORNIA AS A GLOBAL NATION STATE. TO START LOOKING AT HOW WE- PEOPLE IN THE QUALITY OF EMPATHY UNDERSTANDING AND- YOU KNOW IT BRINGS TO MIND THE MERCHANT OF VENICE SCHAEFER WHO SAYS A QUALITY OF MERCY IS NOT STRAINED IT FALLS A MEMBER LIKE A GERMAN RAIN IT IS TWICE A BLESSING FOR THOSE RECEIVE IT AND THOSE WHO GIVE IT I THINK THOSE WHO WORKED ON THIS CURRICULUM AND THOSE WHO RECEIVE THE BENEFIT WILL INDEED FIND THEM ALL TWICE BENEFITTED. AND I BELIEVE IS VERY IMPORTANT. FOR OUR AREA. I REGION AYE VOTE. THANKS COOLEY MR LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FROM RIVERSIDE FOR HIS TENACITY AND ALSO COMMENDED VARIOUS LEADERS OF THE RESPECTIVE ETHNIC CAUCUSES FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISUALLY SEE THIS ON THE FLOOR THERE WAS A DEMONSTRATION OF INCREDIBLE SOLIDARITY AND THE JEWISH CAUCUS AND I THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE- LGBT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS MYSELF AND AS VICE CHAIR OF ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. FOR DEEP EMPATHY AND SOLIDARITY ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW. COLLEAGUES I AM A PRODUCT OF ETHNIC STUDIES. AND ALL SHARE A MOMENT OF VULNERABILITY GROWING UP AS A FOURTH GENERATION CALIFORNIAN THAT I HATED MYSELF. I HATED BEING ASIAN I WAS ASHAMED OF BEING ASIAN GROWING UP BORN AND RAISED IN SAN JOSE. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I WOULD BRING MY LUNCH PAIL OPEN UP MY BOX OF LUNCH AND PEOPLE YOUNG KIDS WOULD CRINGE AND SAY YOU THAT STINKY. WHY ARE YOU SO FOREIGN. THAT'S NOT AMERICAN FOOD. I GO HOME TRYING. TO MY PARENTS SAYING I WANT TO SPEAK ENGLISH ONLY. MY PARENTS SAID YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND CULTURE YOUR OWN IDENTITY. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO AMERICA I SAID I REFUSE. SO THAT'S WHY SPEAK ENGLISH ONLY TODAY. I FEEL LOST. A PERPETUAL FOREIGNER. ASIAN PROVIDERS DON'T SEE ME AS CHINESE BECAUSE I DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE AND HERE IN MY OWN HOME COUNTRY AS A FOURTH GENERATION CALIFORNIA I STILL FEEL. LIKE A FOREIGNER. THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE. IT WASN'T UNTIL I TOOK ETHNIC STUDIES. I START TO LEARN ABOUT MY OWN HISTORY. SAID WHY DID I NOT LEARN ABOUT THIS IN SCHOOL. THAT CHINESE AMERICANS HAVE MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FABRIC. OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND THE RAILROADS AND BY THE WAY LABOUR'S WITHIN KICKED OUT WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS ON MY OWN HISTORY. GROWING UP IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AFTER GROWING UP AND GETTING A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. THAT'S IT WE'RE DONE. STAMP OF APPROVAL YOU'RE A GOOD ACTIVE CITIZEN. HOW DO WE EXPECT TO BE TALKING TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT LEARNING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S CULTURE AND IDENTITY WE OPERATE IN SILOS IN TRIBALISM WE DON'T TALK WITH EACH OTHER WE TALKED TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW TO STOP AP I HATE. THAT IS THE CALL FOR ACTION THE DEMAND THE REQUEST. FOR ETHNIC STUDIES SO THAT WE CAN TO LEARN ABOUT OUR OWN AMERICAN HISTORY AND BY THE WAY. WE LEARN ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF DIVERSITY FROM EVERYONE. SO COLLEAGUES THINK ABOUT IT FROM THE FRAMEWORK OF A YOUNG CHILD. GROWING UP SIMILAR TO ME HATING THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL AMERICAN. THERE'S SOMETHING TO PROVE NOT TRULY PATRIOTIC AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER TO LEARN ABOUT OR CALIFORNIA AND OUR OWN AMERICAN HISTORY IT'S GOING TO STRENGTHEN THE DIVERSITY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT OUR OWN HISTORY WE DON'T KNOW. THE FUTURE AND WE'RE GOING I THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FROM RIVERSIDE FOR HIS COMPASSION I HOPE ALL OF YOU BUT ALSO VOTE AYE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU.

I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND THE FUTURE OF OUR NATION AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE A FEW THINGS. I DON'T LEARN ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES OR CHICANO STUDIES UNTIL I GOT TO COLLEGE. AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I MADE AN ACTIVE DECISION TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE RIGHT AWAY I ACTUALLY WENT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TWO YEARS AFTER. I BARELY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS A STORY THAT I HAVE SHARED ON THIS FLOOR BEFORE. BUT IT IS THROUGH ETHNIC STUDIES AND CHICANO STUDIES IN PARTICULAR NIGHT HAVE A MINOR INTO CATTLE STUDIES BECAUSE I. LOVED AND BELIEVED IN WHAT I WAS BEING TAUGHT AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL AND I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED ALL THOSE THINGS. IN HIGH SCHOOL. TO THE POINT OF KNOWING WHO I WAS ETHNIC STUDIES CHICANO STUDIES TAUGHT ME ABOUT CELLS ARE TRAVIS THE LOTUS WETA. CORKY GONZALEZ BEAT CRUSADE FOR JUSTICE. I AM JOAQUIN LOST IN A WORLD OF CONFUSION. CONFUSED BY RULES SCORNED BY ATTITUDES SUPPRESS. BY MANIPULATION AND DESTROYED BY A MODERN SOCIETY I AM BLOCKED THEM OAK PROUD. AND NOBLE. IT WAS THROUGH CHICANO STUDIES THAT I LEARNED ABOUT THE AUDIENCE HOW DO A AND CHERRY MORAGA. AND IS A BRIDGE CALLED MY BACK AND POWERFUL WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ARE BOLDLY TELLING THEIR STORIES IN A WAY THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TOLD BEFORE. IT WAS THROUGH CHICANO STUDIES THAT I LEARNED ABOUT CHICANOS AND FILM AND THE OSCAR STATUE MODELED AFTER A MEXICAN AMERICAN. NAMED EMILIO FERNANDEZ WHO WROTE ABOUT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD AND WHO LIVED IN AUSTIN LOS ANGELES. IN EXILE. BECAUSE OF WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE WAS DOING. IT WAS THREE CHICANO STUDIES AND ETHNIC STUDIES THAT I LEARNED. A PATHWAY INTO MY OWN CULTURE OF SENT BEING CENTRAL AMERICAN AND CENTRAL AMERICAN STUDIES WHERE I LEARNED. ABOUT JOSE CASTELLANOS WHO HELPED. IN THE BOOK THE MAN WHO STOP THE TRAINS TO AUSCHWITZ GEORGE MANTEO AND SOME OF THE LORD. AND SWITZERLAND'S FINEST HOUR AND HOW IS HOW DO I LOAD PLAYED A ROLE. AGAINST THE HOLOCAUST IN HELPING JEWISH PEOPLE FIND FREEDOM IN THIS TINY LITTLE. PLACE THAT I AM FROM IN CENTRAL AMERICA IT IS THROUGH ALL OF THESE. EFFORTS IT IS THROUGH THIS MOVEMENT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES AND CHICANO STUDIES AND CENTRAL AMERICAN STUDIES. THAT I LEARNED AND UNDERSTOOD. WHO I WAS. AND I MUST'VE BEEN TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD AT THAT TIME. AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THAT LONG FOR ME TO FIND OUT WHERE I COME FROM. AND WHO I AM. AND WHAT I STAND FOR AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FOR AND HOW I COULD ACTUALLY FIND. AROUND AND FOUNDATION AS TO WHO I WAS AND MY ROLE IN SOCIETY. THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IT IS IMPACTFUL IT IS NECESSARY IT IS NEEDED IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THEMSELVES AND TO LEARN ABOUT OTHERS. IT IS ABOUT TIME. TIME HAS PASSED THIS IS THE MOMENT AND IF NOT NOW WHEN. AND IF NOT US WHO. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE AND IT IS ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE SHOULD NOT WASTE AND I WANT TO THINK IT PROFIT SO IT. WHO HAS BEEN IN THIS FIGHT FOR YEARS THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL MOMENT FOR US.

TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO'VE SIGNED THE PETITION IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE OH ONE GEN UP. IS DOING FANTASTICWORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND MAYBE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TODAY UNLIKE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES ARE NOT MARCHING AND MAYBE THEY'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO MARCH BECAUSE OF COLD IT BUT THEY ARE USING TECHNOLOGY. TWENTY THOUSAND NAMES ON THIS PETITION IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE OH ONE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE JEWISH CARCASS THANK YOU. I AM PROUD TO HAVE BEEN AND AM A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS THANK YOU FOR STANDING WITH US. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKVILLE. AS YOU HEARD. MY COLLEAGUE I'M SALINAS SAY I WAS IN THE CLASSROOM FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS. I SAW FIRSTHAND HOW THIS CURRICULUM CHANGES THE LIVES OF STUDENTS. I WALKED AROUND RIVERSIDE TODAY AND STUDENTS COME UP TO ME. AND THEY DON'T THANK ME MR MEDINA FOR SHOWING ME HOW TO CONJUGATE. IRREGULAR VERBS IN SPANISH THEY SHOULD BUT THEY DON'T. OR TEACHING SUBJUNCTIVE. WHICH IS STRICTLY. THEY THANK ME AND THEY CONTINUE TO THANK ME FOR WHAT THEY LEARN IN MY CHICANO STUDIES CLASS. BECAUSE STUDENTS TEACH THEMSELVES STUDENTS BRING IN SUCH A RICH HISTORY WHETHER THEY'RE BEING NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. LATINO STUDENTS THEY BRING AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS THEY BRING THEIR CULTURE TO CLASS. AND IF THEY SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THE BOOKS IN THE CURRICULUM THEY SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THE TEACHERS TO STAND IN FRONT OF THEM THEY LEARN AND THEY TEACH EACH OTHER. AND THEY CAN TEACH US. THAT IS WHAT I LEARNED. TO MY COLLEAGUE. FROM ROCK WITH. AND WHEN STUDENTS ARE ENGAGED THEY ARE NOT ONLY ENGAGE IN ETHNIC STUDIES. AS MY COLLEAGUE SAN DIEGO MENTION STEADY'S FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY OF SHOWN THAT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ETHNIC STUDIES DO BETTER NOT ONLY IN ETHNIC STUDIES BUT IN ALL CLASSES. THERE AFTER THEIR ABS ABSENTEEISM DROPS GPAS HAVE GONE UP. AND THAT IS FOR ALL STUDENTS. NOT ONLY STUDENTS OF COLOR. BUT ALL STUDENTS. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE. REMINDS ME OF ONE OF MY HEROES. WHOSE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH IS TODAY TWELVE YEARS AGO TODAY. NASSAR RONALD TAKAKI OF BERKELEY OF CAL UNIVERSITY. PASSED AWAY. HIS BOOKS ARE BEING TAUGHT IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL. I BELIEVE THAT RONALD TAKAKI SMILES ON US TODAY. BECAUSE RONALD TAKAKI SAID THIS STORY HE WAS IN WASHINGTON DC. TO GIVE A CONFERENCE. AND HE'S RIGHT IN THE TAXI GOING TO GIVE. HIS SPEECH AT THE CONFERENCE AND THE TAXI DRIVER. YOU KNOW JUST MAKING SMALL TALK. ASKED HIM WHERE ARE YOU FROM. THANK RONALD TAKAKI THEY'VE ANSWERED CALIFORNIA. BUT THE TAXI DRIVER WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT ANSWER HE SAID NO ARE YOU REALLY FROM. I DON'T KNOW IF HE SAID HAWAII BECAUSE RONALD TAKAKI GREW UP IN HAWAII. BUT THAT IS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AS WELL. MANY OF US HAVE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE TO BE SEEN AS THE OTHER. TO BE SEEN AS A FOREIGNER IN THIS COUNTRY. WHETHER WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR GENERATIONS AND IT IS IN CLASSES LIKE ETHNIC STUDIES THAT WE LEARN ABOUT THE TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO. THAT WE LEARN ABOUT THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT. THE ASIAN LAND LAW IT AFFECTED RIVERSIDE THE WE LEARN ABOUT. THE MASSACRE OF NATIVE AMERICANS. I THANK YOU ALL FOR SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THANK YOU ALL FOR GOING VOTING I. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. URGE YOU TO VOTE BY AN EIGHTY ONE OH ONE. THANK YOU MISS MEDINA CLERK LEVEL THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS OF. DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS VOTE. DESIRABLE. CLARK WELL. A CLOSER ALL CALVET EYES FIFTY SIX NO SIX THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS. MISTER KALRA YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AS A PRINCIPAL COOPER ON BEHALF OF SENATOR KAMLAGER. I'M HONORED TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL ONE EIGHTEEN WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE COMMUNITY RESPONSE INITIATIVE. TO STRENGTHEN EMERGENCY SYSTEMS OR CRISIS ACT WHICH THE PILOT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY BASED RESPONSES TO LOCAL EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. EVERY DAY IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUCCESSFULLY RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS SUCH AS PEOPLE DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR IMPACTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS. AB ONE EIGHTEEN IS A REINTRODUCTION OF THE VETOED BILL FROM LAST SESSION. THE AUTHOR HAS SINCE ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY TO OVERSEE THE PILOT PROGRAM IN RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. THE CRISIS ACTORS GARNERED NATIONAL ATTENTION EVEN INSPIRED INNOVATIVE FEDERAL LEGISLATION WHICH ALSO SEEKS TO CATALYZE THE INVOLVEMENT. OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE. INTERACTION PLEASE CAN BE SCARY AND TRAUMATIZING FOR MANY PEOPLE. BY PRIORITIZING COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONS THE CRISIS ACT WILL HELP PROTECT THE PEOPLE MOST AT RISK FROM USE OF FOR CENTURIES AND UP. INCLUDING THOSE OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES PEOPLE ARE BLACK LATINO OR INDIGENOUS MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND ON HEALTH INDIVIDUALS. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR AS THEIR CERVANTES A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN WITH AUTISM. AND HARD OF HEARING WAS SHOT IN THE BACK BY LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES AT HIS HOME IN KENTUCKY. HIS MOTHER CALLED THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE FOR ASSISTANCE AND WITHIN THREE MINUTES OF BEING CALLED TO HELP IDEAS AND HIS FAMILY. HE WAS SHOT ON THE FLOOR OF HIS LIVING ROOM. THE FAMILY WILL NEVER KNOW THIS TRAGIC TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN. DE ESCALATED WITH COMMUNITY BASED INTERVENTION. TODAY POLICE KILL PEOPLE WITH UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA SIXTEEN TIMES MORE OFTEN. THAN PEOPLE WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE. WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON. MENTAL HEALTH IN TRAINING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY ARE NOT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. THERE ARE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS RESPONDING SUCCESSFULLY TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS BUT THEIR IMPACT HAS LIMITED RESOURCES. AB ONE EIGHTEEN BUILT ON SUCCESSFUL EFFORT FROM LA THE BAY AREA SACRAMENTO AND OTHER CITIES LOOKING TO A SMARTER WAY TO DEAL WITH THE PERSON'S INDIVIDUAL CRISIS. IN THE COMMUNITY. DESPITE THE POSITIVE IMPACT AND COST SAVINGS AND COMMUNITY ORIENTED RESPONSES TO EMERGENCIES THE STATE HAS DONE LITTLE TO SUPPORT AND SCALE THESE EFFORTS. INSTEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE FORCED TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES BETTER SUITED FOR PEER SUPPORT EXPERTS MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS OR COUNTY CRISIS COUNSELORS TRAINED TO DE ESCALATE AND RESOLVE CRISES. AB ONE EIGHTEEN THE CRISIS ACTORS INVESTING IN THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THERE ARE ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY RESPONDING TO MANY TIMES TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND HAVE THE EXPERTISE. RELATIONSHIPS NETWORKS ENTRUSTS TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. DANISH CAR. SEEING NOTED DEBATE ON THE ITEM. CARCLUB RURAL.

ASSEMBLY BILL SIX TWENTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR QUE HAN ANOTHER SNACK LIVING JUVENILES MS BARRICADE HAND THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY REPRESENT AB SIX TWENTY FOUR A TECHNICAL BUT HUGELY IMPACTFUL PROCEDURAL BILL THAT WILL HAVE AN ENORMOUS EFFECT FOR YOUTH WITHIN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE FOCUS IS ON REHABILITATION AND IT IS CENTERED ON WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU. AND ENSURING POSITIVE OUTCOMES. IN SOME CASES PROSECUTORS MAY ARGUE THE YOU'D BE TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT FOR GOING THE JUVENILE COURT PROCESS. CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS SIXTEEN HAVE BEEN TRIED IN ADULT COURT FACING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. FIFTY SIX SHOW THE BLACK AND BROWN YOUTH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY SENT TO ADULT COURT COURT WELL THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS ARE MORE OFTEN ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN JUVENILE JURISDICTION. SHOCKINGLY IN CURRENT LAW THE TRIAL HAS NO RIGHT TO APPEAL THE DECISION TO GO TO ADULT COURT THERE IS ONLY A DISCRETIONARY RATE THAT IS OFTEN SUMMARILY DENIED AND NOT REVIEWED ON THE MERITS. THE BILL YOU BEFORE YOU TODAY DOES NOT UP AND THECURRENT PROCESS BUT AT THE CLEAR PATH REVIEW OF THESE TRANSFER DECISIONS. SB SIX TWENTY FOUR CREATES AN APPEAL PROCESS OF THE DECISION TO TRANSFER YOU TO DAHLE COURT AND REQUIRES THAT IT BE DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. AS NOT TO DELAY THE USE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL. THE BILL IS IN LINE WITH THE VALUES OF THIS BODY AND IT IS TRULY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE YOUTH AT THIS PIVOTAL JUNCTURE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THIS DECISION. YOU CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIVES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER. FAME IS BACKING HIM SEEING. NO DISCUSSION OF A ON THE ITEM OVER THERE ARE. MEMBERS RESIDE IN THE HOME VOTE OUT OF A.

MS BARAKAT THANK YOU SPEAKER AND MY EIGHT SEVEN ONE IS A GOVERNMENT MEASURE THAT WILL REQUIRE COUNTY STATEWIDE TO AND SUBMIT. ON OFFENDERS PROGRAM PROVIDED TO INMATES IN COUNTY. AND THE SIX RATES REDUCE RISK OF PRO. EACH YEAR SINCE REALIGNMENT WAS ENACTED APPROPRIATIONS IN THE STATE BUDGET HAVE PROVIDED MONEY FOR COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT DIVERSE APPROACHES FOR SUPERVISION AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT AIM TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM SEND SEND INFORMATION ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S RECIDIVISM PROGRAMMING SPECIFIC TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THESE COUNTY JAILS IS FRAGMENTED AND DIFFICULT TO DIGEST. IT IS SIMPLY NONSENSICAL TO CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE DOLLARS IN PROGRAMMING IF WE HAVE NO CLUE OF WHETHER THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL OR WHETHER THEIR FAILURES TO THAT POINT OUR STATE AUDITOR CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT AND SEVERAL COUNTING. AND FOUND THAT THE COUNTIES LACK ADEQUATE PLANNING AND OVERSIGHT FOR REALIGNMENT SPENDING AND ARE HOLDING EXCESSIVE REALIGNMENT SURPLUSES WHICH COULD BE USED TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY SHE ALSO SAID IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THIS LEGISLATURE TO BRING FULL TRANSPARENCY THE TO THESE PROGRAMS AND OUR SPENDING WE HAVE SPENT OVER SIX. BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS AND HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS INVESTMENT THE AUDITOR'S REPORT ALSO WENT TO SAY ON THAT THE PRACTICES IN PROGRESS REPORTS TO LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT AND INCOMPLETE. THIS BILL WILL STANDARDIZE A LOOK AT THESE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUCCESS. OF A REHABILITATIVE SERVICES. MY OFFICE IS WORK WITH THE IN. DEVELOPED REPORTING WHICH GIVE THE LIE. THE INFOR WE NEED TO MAKE SOUNDS GOVERNING DECISIONS AS WELL AS HAVE CLARITY FOR THE COUNTIES AND HOW TO GATHER AND SUBMIT THE DATA.

AND MORE EFFECTIVELY SPEND STATE DOLLARS I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU IS BURKE A HEY MISTER COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AND SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THINK MY COLLEAGUES TO BRING IT FORWARD. IT'S IMPORTANT THINK ABOUT RECIDIVISM MOST FOLKS SINCE THE COUNTY JAIL RIGHT NOW SOME AS LONG AS FOURTEEN YEARS. WE HAVE NO IDEA WITH RECIDIVISM RATE IS WE KNOW IT'S HIGHS PROBABLY 70% AT LEAST. VALUE BETTER PROGRAM TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE WITH THIS. AND I KNOW IT'S BIG RIGHT NOW HOPEFULLY IT WORKS MORE ON IT'S KIND NEARLY. BUT I KNOW FOR STATE PRISON IF YOU'RE IF YOU GO BACK AFTER TWO YEARS THAT'S NOT CONSIDER RECIDIVISM. SO HOPEFULLY WE NARAL THAT DOWN AND GET IT MORE WORDS WERE DEFECTIVE SO WE CAN STOP THE VICIOUS CYCLE SO. THE BILLING THIS BRING THIS BILL FORD AND I- I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THEY WHICH COULD.

ALTHOUGH EVERY SINGLE WORKER PAYS INTO THIS PROGRAM TOO MANY AT ESPECIALLY LOWER INCOME WORKERS IN MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES CAN'T ACTUALLY ACCESS IT THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE PAY SIXTY SUPPOSEDLY YET EVEN IF YOU'RE A FULL TIME MINIMUM WAGE WORKER MAKING FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR YOU WOULD ONLY RECEIVE EIGHT DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING ESPECIALLY A NEW PARENT CAN LIVE ON WHEN YOUR EXPENSES ARE THE HIGHEST THEY'VE EVER BEEN AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY BEING PAID FAR LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. I WOULD ASK THAT ON THIS FLOOR WE'VE DONE A LOT FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE'VE EXTENDED IT IN A VARIETY OF FORMS BUT THE ONE THING WE HAVEN'T DONE AND WE NEVER DO. IS ENSURE THAT OUR LOWEST INCOME WORKERS CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS THE BENEFITS THAT WE APPROVE. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. THE PEOPLE WHO I WOULD ARGUE PROBABLY NEED THIS THE MOST.

THANK YOU COLLEAGUES WE'RE ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH HOMELESSNESS ON OUR STREETS OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS EVERY NIGHT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR CONSTITUENTS WHO BEEN ON SATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSE OF GOVERNMENT THUS FAR. ARE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED A RECORD TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISE THAT WE SPEND IN THIS AREA AND ARE LEGISLATURE IDEAS I BELIEVE WILL AT LEAST MATCH THAT IF NOT REYES THAT WHATEVER WEEK RETURN THE BUDGET WE NEED REAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND A CLEAR STRATEGY TO ENSURE THESE INVESTMENTS WORK. AS OUR GOVERNOR HAS SAID THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME INVESTMENT BUT O MAKE IT COUNT WE HAVE TO BE STRATEGIC AT THIS TIME STATE AGENCIES AND MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE LACKED COORDINATION TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE DATA DRIVEN APPROACHES. THIS BILL WOULD HOLD STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROGRESS BY REQUIRING CITIES AND COUNTIES AND STATE AGENCIES TO COMPLETE CAPS IN% NEEDS ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS BASED ON THESE ANALYSES STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CREATE ACTUAL PLANS TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS BY 90% BY THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY THIRTY. AND THE BILL WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH A HOMELESSNESS INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT COULD HOLD STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAILING TO SUBMIT PLANS ARE NOT FOLLOWING PLANS BY ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY BASED ON BENCHMARKS THIS BILL WOULD MOVE CALIFORNIA TOWARD HOPEFULLY FINALLY ADDRESSING THE MORE CRISIS OF OUR DAY. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER TO MISS WORK SILVA YOU ARE. IN THE READY TO. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES I RELICENSED SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHT SIXTEEN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. THIS BODY HAS VOTED ON MANY MANY HOUSING POLICIES AND YET. WE ARE STILL. STEPS AWAY FIRST SOLVING THE CRISIS THAT WE SEE RIGHT OUTSIDE THESE DOORS. PEOPLE LINE AND ALLEYS. PEOPLE ON THE STREETS. THAT ARE HUNGRY THAT ARE DIRTY AND NEED OF HEALTH CARE AND SHELTER. WE DEBATE MANY MANY TIMES ABOUT ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE ISSUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THIS BODY AGREES ON ACCORDING TO RECENT POLLS. FROM REPUBLICANS TO DEMOCRATS TWO INDEPENDENTS THAT WE MUST. ADDRESS OUR HOMELESS CRISIS AND WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB RELATED TO ACCOUNTABILITY RELATED TO DATA AND RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS IT IS A MORAL CRISIS TO WALK OUT OF THESE CHAMBERS WALK RIGHT DOWN A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE OR EVEN ACROSS THE N. STREET HERE IN THIS GREAT STATE. AND SEE PEOPLE. EITHER COLD OR HUNGRY OR DYING ON OUR STREETS IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND WE NEED TO DO MORE AND I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB. EIGHT EIGHT SIXTEEN. THANK YOU MISS KIRK SILVA. MR SANTIAGO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. AND I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STRESS THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE NEED ONE MORE DRESS IN THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. NOW IN THE STATE WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION SPENT MANY OF DOLLARS DATING BACK FROM NO PLACE LIKE HOME HE HAPPENED WE'RE NOW HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DOLLARS. AND THAT WILL BE SPENT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. SO WE CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH. THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY PART IRON CLAD ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THAT WE BEGIN TO ATTACK TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. BECAUSE WHAT'S AT STAKE. IS IT IS THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT DIE ON THE STREET EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO AT SOME POINT TIME NOT JUST A QUESTION OF MONEY. AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS WE HAVE GOT TO LAY DOWN IRONCLAD ACCOUNTABILITY SO THAT WE BEGIN TO ADDRESS. A POPULATION THAT HAS BEEN LONG WAITING AND IS SUFFERING GREATLY ON THE STREETS. OUR ON HOUSE COMMUNITY DESERVES BETTER THAN THAT AND FOR THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I'VE- THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO MISTER WHAT DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE TO MISTER SPEAKER AMANDA SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO. ADD THAT. A LOT OF THE- A LOT OF WHAT WE SEE OUT THE SIDE THESE DOORS. HAS THE LOOK OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAS THE APPEARANCE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AS WELL. AND AS YOU TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. MY HOPE IS THAT THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE THOSE ISSUES HOLISTICALLY AS WELL. JUST PUTTING PEOPLE IN HOUSING DOESN'T NECESSARILY SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS FOR THEM WITH OUT THESE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. SO IN ADDITION THE ACCOUNTABILITY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COORDINATION I FEEL LIKE WE NEED. AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER TO. MANAGE ALL OF THIS AND RIGHT NOW- I DON'T SEE IT AND I HOPE I HOPE THAT COMES TO BE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MR CHIU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU LET ME JUST THANK OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE JUST SPOKEN- WE OFTEN IDENTIFIER COLLEAGUES FROM WHERE THEY REPRESENTS BUT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY SHE KNOWS.

I DO WANT TO DRESS ARE CALLING FROM HILLS FOR AGAIN LET YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU'VE LAID OUT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH IN THIS BILL AND BY THAT I MEAN WE KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS IS COMPLICATED THERE ARE MANY MANY CAUSES FOR THEIR MANY MANY SOLUTIONS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS THE CITIES AND COUNTIES YOU HAVE TO DO AN ASSESSMENT. OF WHO'S HOMELESS IN YOUR COMMUNITY WHY ARE THEY HOMELESS AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO GIVE US A CONCRETE PLAN OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO REDUCE SAID IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY AND WHAT WE SAY TO THEM IS NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS ANALYSIS INTO THIS PLAN BUT AS A STATE WE'RE GONNA HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT AS WE GIVE YOU MONEY WE'RE GOING TO WANT YOU TO TELL US WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THAT AREA. WE GIVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE FREEDOM TO PROPOSE HOW THEY WANT TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IS SEAT IN THEIR DISTRICTS AND IN THEIR CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CAN HYMNS OF CARE BUT ULTIMATELY THIS BILLS ABOUT HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING THOSE RESULTS AND MY HOPE IS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF A SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATION AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE ARE ABOUT TO VOTE IN THE NEXT MONTH ON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO GO. TO SUPPORT OUR DISTRICTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE MORE CRISIS OF THE DAY SO WITHOUT REALLY RESPECT AND APPRECIATE THE MANY CONVERSATIONS WE'VE. HAD ABOUT THIS AND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.
