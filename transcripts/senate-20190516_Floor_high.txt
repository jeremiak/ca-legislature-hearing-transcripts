SEVENTY THREE MEMBERS WE LIKE TO BE A START WITH AT FILE ITEM FOURTEEN TODAY. CENTER GLAZER PREPARED TO PRESENT. MISTER SECRETARY CAN YOU PLEASE READ. FILE ITEM. FOURTEEN SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY ONE MESSENGER GLAZER AN ACT RELATING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT GOOD MORNING SENATOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS -- SB FIVE THIRTY ONE SIXTY AND A PERVERSE INCENTIVE. IN OUR CURRENT TAX CODE THAT IS LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GIVE AWAY. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE TO PRIVATE CORPORATIONS. THESE DEALS TAKE MONEY FROM EVERY CITY IN THE STATE. AND GIVE IT TO SOME OF THE RICHEST CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD. THAT'S JUST WRONG. UNDER BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM LOCAL SALES TAX LAW. SALES TAX REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE POINT OF SALE. FOR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES THIS MEANS ALLOCATING THE REVENUE TO A JURISDICTION THE STORE IS LOCATED IN. AND WE'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. ONLINE RETAILERS HOWEVER. HAD HE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE SALES TAX REVENUE. THE DATA WAREHOUSE THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER EVEN A SALES OFFICE. THIS ALLOWS CORPORATIONS TO DIRECT REVENUES TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. NOW CORPORATIONS USE THIS LEVERAGE WHEN NEGOTIATING TO LOCATE THEIR BUSINESS SOMEPLACE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS RESULTS IN A RIGGED PROCESS. DRIVING CITIES TO ACCEPT INCREASINGLY ONEROUS TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. IN EXCHANGE FOR ONLINE RETAILERS BUILDING OR RELOCATING IN THEIR JURISDICTION. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS PRIVATE COMPANIES PROFIT BUILT FROM THEIR ONLINE SALES AND FROM THE SALES TAX REBATES. OFTEN CITIES WILL GIVE THESE CORPORATIONS MORE THAN HALF OF THE SALES TAX REVENUES ALLOCATED. TO THEIR JURISDICTION. THESE COMPANIES BENEFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC. AT A TIME WHEN OUR CITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND PUBLIC PROGRAMS. COMPANIES ARE SIPHONING BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS. FURTHER WHILE THESE DEALS ARE OFTEN TOUTED FOR CREATING JOBS AND HAVING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. IN MY VIEW THESE CLAIMS ARE DUBIOUS. SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRED THAT THE PROMISED JOBS OR EVEN CREATED. AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO HOWEVER JOBS IN THESE WAREHOUSES. ARE GRUELING. LOW WAGE AND IN MANY CASES LACK BENEFITS. THE CITY'S NEED REAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING FAMILIES NOT A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. FOR THESE REASONS SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WOULD PROHIBIT ANY FUTURE SALES TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND PRIVATE CORPORATIONS. IT HAS NO EFFECT ON ANY EXISTING DEAL WHEN MAKE THAT CLEAR AGAIN. WOULD HAVE NO AFFECT ON ANY EXISTING DEAL. IT TAKES NO MONEY FROM ANY CITY. AND IT DOES NOT REDUCE THE SALES TAX REVENUE THAT ANY CITY CAN RECEIVE IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND MANY OTHERS AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. PETER GROW THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I'D. LIKE TO JUST TELL MY COLLEAGUES AT YOU KNOW I I REALLY APPRECIATE LIKE THE INTENT OF WHAT YOUR BILL DOES. BUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR ECONOMICS IT ECONOMICS THAT WE HAVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S A HUGE DISPARITY FROM THE COASTAL LINES. AND WHAT WE HAVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT I SHARE KERN AND TULARE WITH BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE IS AN ASSET IS LAND. LAND SOMETHING MANY OF YOU DON'T HAVE IN YOUR DISTRICTS WHERE THESE HUGE MASSIVE WAREHOUSES OR BUILDINGS CAN BE. PLACED AND TO TAKE THIS ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE AWAY FROM US IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN WE SUFFER SO MUCH WITH A LOT OF POLICIES THAT ARE PASSED THROUGH THIS AND THIS IS AN ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE FOR US FOR INSTANCE. RIGHT IN KERN COUNTY WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE WITH TAX CREDITS THE AMAZON FACILITY THAT PROVIDED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONSTRUCTION JOBS RIGHT BY OUR AIRPORT -- THAT LED RIGHT TO THE FREEWAY WHICH GAVE AMAZON A DELIVERY POINT SO THAT THEY COULD GET PRODUCTS OUT TO ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND THAT CREATED THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN OUR DISTRICT -- GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO LIKE I SAID I UNDERSTAND -- THE YOUR YUR COMMENTS AND I UNDERSTAND THE BILL BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE RULE AREAS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AN ASSET AND IT'S THE LAND IN THE PLACES TO PUT THESE FACILITIES. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN OUR AREAS AS WELL. WE GET WATER RESTRICTION OIL RESTRICTION A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT RESTRICT US FROM EMPLOYING PEOPLE THAT IN KEEPING THEM GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AT A REALLY REALLY GOOD WAGE. AND THIS IS ONE AVENUE THAT WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KEEP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU LATER. MEMBERS ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR SENATOR MORLOCK GOOD MORNING SIR. MORNING MR PRESIDENT TED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO MY POLITICAL CAREER STARTED BECAUSE I DECIDED TO POINT OUT. THE PROBLEMS WITH A MONEY MAKING SCHEME THAT WAS BEING. PERPETRATED BY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. OUR TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR HAD FIGURED OUT A WAY TO BORROW ON THE SHORT END OF THE YIELD CURVE. BY FOR YOUR BONDS A LITTLE FURTHER OUT AND MAKE THE SPREAD. AND SINCE THAT WAS SO GOOD HE HE TRIPLE DOWNEY BORROWED THREE TIMES MORE. TO MAKE THIS INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY -- FOR THE PARTICIPANTS SOME HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN PARTICIPANTS FROM AROUND THE STATE IN THE PORTFOLIO THE ORANGE COUNTY INVESTMENT POOL. AND WHEN I RAN IT WAS COUNTY WIDE AND I WOULD BUMP IN THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. AND THEY WOULD LITERALLY CHEW ME OUT WHY AM I GOING AFTER THE GOOSE THAT IS LAYING THE GOLDEN EGGS IT'S THIS GUY WHO IS GENERATING ALL THIS EXTRA INTEREST INCOME THAT'S HELPING US. BALANCE OUR BUDGET DURING THE NINETEEN NINETY RECESSION. MEMBERS KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESS THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE OF AN ACID THE COULD PLEASE KEEP OUR CONVERSATIONS TO A MINIMUM. THERE ARE MORE LOCKED I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. MISTER PRESIDENT YOU CAN INTERRUPT ME ANYTIME. YOU DID A GREAT JOB. SO WHAT NO ONE NO ONE REALLY LOOKED INSIDE THE BLACK BOX NO ONE SAID WHAT'S HE DOING HE WAS RUNNING A HEDGE FUND HE WAS RECALLED THE CARRY TRADE TODAY AND WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE RISING ON THE SHORT END OF THE YIELD CURVE WHICH ARE DOING. RISE WE SPEAK YOU GET OUT OF HIS BUSINESS AND HE DID NOT THIS ENGAGE. SO WITH THAT THE COUNTY OF ORANGE IMPLODED WE LOST ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THE PARTS OF THE SCHEME STARTED TO MOVE IN THE WRONG. DIRECTION AND THE COLLATERAL CALLS ARE MADE IN AN ORANGE COUNTY WATCHED A BOATLOAD. OF MONEY COLLEAGUES I'VE SEEN MORE SCHEMES IN MY TIME NOW THE PUBLIC SECTOR -- REDEVELOPMENT. YOU KNOW IF A IF IF WE CAN CONSIDER A SMALL PART OF OUR CITIES BLIGHTED THEM. AND THAT HELPS WITH A TAX INCREMENTAL A REVENUE TO THE CITY THEN WHY DON'T WE DECLARE THE WHOLE CITY BLIGHTED. ONLY A TWO CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT DID JUST THAT AND NOW THEY'RE STRUGGLING AFTER REDEVELOPMENT WAS REMOVED. ANOTHER INTERESTING SCHEME WAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS IF YOU CAN BORROW MONEY AND USE THE SHORT END OF THE YIELD CURVE AND GET A REAL LOW RATE FOR A PORTION OF THE DEAL WHY DON'T YOU DO IT FOR THE WHOLE DEAL. WELL THAT WORKED OUT GREAT YOUR HERO UNTIL THE SHORT END OF THE YIELD CURVE WENT UP IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE WE HAD ANOTHER COUNTY GO BANKRUPT OVER THAT IDEA BECAUSE THEY WENT AND BORROWED FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BIRMINGHAM -- ALABAMA AND SO THEY FILED. THEN THE LARGEST BANKRUPTCY FILING CHAPTER NINE BUMPED ORANGE COUNTY OUT OF FIRST PLACE. SO THERE'S ALL THESE INTERESTING IDEAL IDEAS AND SO THESE SALESMAN COME INTO TOWN TO GIVE GIVE THESE GREAT. OPPORTUNITIES AND NOW WILL. WE HAVE STRUCTURE DEALS TO BUILD WAREHOUSES IN UNIQUE AREAS AND THEY GET ALL THE SALES TAXES IT'S BEING SUCKED OUT. OF OTHER AREAS THIS IS A SCHEME AND IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST VERY LONG. BECAUSE YOU JUST THE ONE BALLOT MEASURE OR YOU NEED ONE BILL OUT OF THIS BUILDING AND YOU CAN STOP THIS. AND THOSE CITIES WILL FEEL THE PAIN BUT IT THEY WILL BE. PART OF A LONG SUCCESSION OF CITIES THAT BELL FOR INTERESTING SCHEME AND THE AND THE PARTIES THAT ARE PROPOSING THESE SCHEMES ARE MAKING UP A BOATLOAD OF MONEY. IN FEES. THEY'LL BE HAPPY UNTIL SOMEONE REALIZES THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN SOLD A BILL OF GOODS. AND SO THIS BILL IS RIGHTEOUS THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT'S SAYING. STOP THIS NONSENSE NOW NO MORE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE YOU ARE HEADED FOR A TRAIN WRECK I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL. COLLEAGUES AND STOP THE NONSENSE BEFORE IT GETS WORSE I ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB FIVE THREE ONE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER MORLOCK. VERY GRATEFUL MEMBERS. YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THE MAJORITY LEADER AND ENDED SENATOR SKINNER. MR MAJORITY LEADER THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- WE HAVE IN THIS LEGISLATURE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN THE VOTERS MADE A CHOICE. TO A LIMIT PROPERTY TAXES IN THE MANNER THEY DID. HAVE COME UP WITH A SERIES OF MECHANISMS SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE WORKED SOME OF WHICH HAVEN'T. IT'S RESULTED IN WHAT WE WHAT WAS NO OFTEN KNOWN IN THE IN THE IN THE PARLANCE IS FISCAL IS ATION OF LAND USE AND I WOULD SUGGEST. THAT AS WE DEBATE THIS HOUSING ISSUE AND WE LOOK AT THE VARIOUS CAUSES THIS RELOCATION OF BRADLEY BURNS MONEY INTO THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS WHERE WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THESE FOLKS. THESE BIG BUSINESSES TO DO THIS STUFF FOR BIG BOX RETAIL OUTSIDE OF BIG CITIES AN AUTO MALLS IN THE LIKE HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF THE CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE CITIES HAVE NOT BEEN INCENTIVIZE. THE BILL THE HOUSING AND YET WHEN THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACTORS IT'S ONE OF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL I JOIN WITH THE AUTHOR IN THIS BILL I DO KNOW AND I THINK THAT THE POINTS MADE BY THOSE IN OPPOSITION. ARE CORRECT IN THE SENSE THAT THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF HARDSHIP. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO MAKE THE FIX THERE ARE BETTER WAYS WE NOW HAVE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WHERE WE CAN USE INCOME TAX FROM TAXPAYERS. THERE'S A NUMBER OF NEW THINGS ON THE SHELVES THAT WILL PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT DON'T HAVE THE DOWNTURN THAT THIS IS DONE BY PROMOTING BIG BOX RETAIL PARTICULARLY OUT OF LARGE CITIES. YOU KNOW AND AND THAT IT'S CREATED THIS PROBLEM WITH FISCAL IS ATION OF LAND USE WE HAVE TO TRY TO WORK ON THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I THINK THIS IS A IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. ASK YOUR EYE BELOW THANK YOU AS MAJORITY LEADER WE NOW LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR SKINNER GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ALSO AND I APPRECIATE THAT. MANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE CURRENT RULES AND I TWO THREE SHE WHY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD PURSUE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL THE WAY OUR TAX STRUCTURE IS. ALL OVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE HAVING TO COMPETE FOR REVENUE. NOW. I STAND HERE THOUGH AND SAY WE NEED TO DEFEND ALL OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE LEGISLATION. DURING THE RECESSION. THAT FIRST. BROKE THE THAT ARE. PRACTICE FIRE INTERNET RETAILERS OF BASICALLY DENYING THE STATE IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM SALES TAX REVENUE. AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING SO LET'S JUST TALK AMAZON FOR MINUTE. AMAZON'S. BUSINESS MODEL WAS BASED ON GIVING YOU AN AYE THE PERCEPTION THAT WE COULD BUY IT CHEAPER FROM THEM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PAY SALES TAX NOW UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW WE STILL OWE THAT SALES TAX. BUT THAT LEFT OUR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD INTO IT LEFT THEM HAVING TO COLLECT FROM EACH OF US INDIVIDUALLY VERY INEFFICIENT AND BASICALLY LEFT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE. SO COURSE DURING THE RECESSION THERE ARE LOTS OF FACTORS BUT WE SAW OUR BRICK AND MORTAR BILL. BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN THE STATE ARE DOWNTOWNS COLLAPSING AS RETAILERS CLOSED AND INTERNET SALES GREW. TODAY WE NOW INTERNET SALES ACROSS THE US HAVE NOW. REACHED A HIGHER NUMBER THAN BURKE AND MORTAR SO WHILE THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO SAVE ALL BRICK AND MORTAR IT LEAST ALLOWS A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. AND IT ALLOWS EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GET SOME SHEER OF THOSE PURCHASES THANK YOU WHEN I MAKE VERSES ALLOWING JUST A FEW LOCAL OVERNMENTS. TO IN A WAY GIVE AWAY MONEY THAT SHOULD GO TO THE STATE AND SHOULD GO TO ALL OF US GIVE AWAY JUST SO THEY CAN CONSOLIDATE. IN YES GET REVENUE THEMSELVES BUT WE LOSE WE EAT THE WHOLE STATE AND EVERY CITY IN THE ENTIRE STATE COFFERS LOSE AS A RESULT OF THE DEAL. SO LET'S GO BACK TO FAIRNESS TO PROTECTING WHATEVER BURKE AND MORTARS WE HAVE LEFT. AND THIS DOES NOT UNDO THE DEAL SO FAR IF I WERE CARRYING THE BILL I MIGHT ADD I TRIED TO UNDO THE DEALS BUT WHATEVER IT DOESN'T SO THOSE VIEW. THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE THEM OR NOT HURT AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER MEMBERS WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. LAST CALL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. HEARING SEE NINE WE'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO CENTER GLAZER FOR CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE SPIRITED DIED DEBATE THIS MORNING. TO THE SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD I'M I'M SENSITIVE TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE IMPACT THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION COULD HAVE -- I WOULD SAY THIS THAT THOSE CITY STILL HAVE ALL THE OTHER -- TAXES THAT ARE COLLECTED THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE TO INCENTIVIZE OF THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THEY HAVE PROPERTY TAXES THE OF THE SALES TAXES THAT THEY COLLECT. THE ONLY THING IT SAYS IN THIS BILL IS YOU CAN'T HAVE A NEW DEAL THE TAKE SALES TAXES FROM ALL OF OUR OTHER CITIES. AS AN INCENTIVE TO LOCATE THERE AND I I I I DID NOT TRYING THIS LEGISLATION TO UNRAVEL THOSE DEALS THAT HAVE OCCURRED ALREADY I AM INTERESTED IN TRYING TO DO THAT AND THAT'S AS SENSITIVE WAY. TO BALANCE THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE BUT I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE RAISED ON THE FLOOR. THE SENATOR FROM COSTA MESA. IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF SCHEMES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE -- BY PROFITEERS -- BLOOMBERG NEWS JUST AT A BIG STORY ON THE PROFITEERS TO DIFFUSE BRADLEY BURNS TO MANIPULATE. ARRANGEMENTS WITH CITIES AND TAKEN PROFITS FOR THEMSELVES AND WAS A GREAT EXPOSES A AND I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO STOP THAT CURTAIL AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATION DOES. DO THAT GOING FORWARD. I TO THE SENATOR FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY GREAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS WHOLE AREA OF TAX REFORM -- YOU BRING UP AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT FAIRNESS AND INCENTIVES AND HAVING THEM RIGHT SIDED. AND CERTAINLY THIS BILL. HELPS LEAD IN THAT DIRECTION ALTHOUGH I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO AND UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. AND THE SENATOR FROM BERKELEY I I APPRECIATE HER HISTORY ON TAX REFORM. AND CERTAINLY AT THE MAIN POINT THAT YOU MADE WHICH IS THAT OUR TAX REFORM HAS TO BENEFIT ALL OF OUR CITIES. AND NOT NOT ALLOW THIS WINNERS AND LOSERS TO BE PICKED. PICKED ON PICKED APART -- TO WHAT -- IN IN A WAY THAT THAT HURTS -- MANY OF OUR PUBLIC SERVICES THAT ARE CITIES ARE OBLIGATED TO ON TO PERFORM. SO MEMBERS IN CLOSING LET ME SAY THAT. THIS MEASURE -- TRIES TO STOP THE DAMAGE GOING FORWARD -- IT'S TO PREVENT CORPORATIONS FOR MANIPULATING OUR TAX CODE WHICH ARE DOING TODAY. ON THIS THE TERM OF POINT OF SALE. I AM TRYING TO RIGHT SIZE AT LEAST GOING FORWARD THE MANIPULATION OF OUR TAX.

ARE THE ECONOMIC ENGINE. IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY GENERATE ABOUT HALF OF ALL JOBS IN CALIFORNIA ALLOWING ENTREPRENEURS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS TO EARN A LIVING AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR GOLDEN STATE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE OVER THREE POINT NINE MILLION. SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE STATE REPRESENTING AN OVERWHELMING SHARE OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE BY EMPLOYING MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE. AND OF THE SEVENTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SMALL FIRMS THAT EXPORTED GOODS FROM CALIFORNIA. THEY GENERATED 43% OF THE STATE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO BILLION IN TOTAL EXPORTS. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS WELL THAT WITHIN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY A GROWING NUMBER OF THESE COMPANIES ARE STARTED AT OWNED BY WOMEN. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT'S ESTIMATED THAT ONE POINT SIX MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES WERE MINORITY OWNED. LET'S REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH ENHANCE CALIFORNIANS WHO HUMAN CAPITAL.

SIX THIRTY THIS MORNING I WAS WITH A SMALL BUSINESS -- MY PERSONAL TRAINER IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND I WAS THERE AT SIX THIRTY THIS MORNING -- TODAY I KNOW THAT MY INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL PET HALEY WHO'S FIFTEEN WE'LL BE SEEING OUR VETERINARIAN. THAT PERSON IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME TODAY BECAUSE HI HAILEY SEES HER VETERINARIAN QUITE OFTEN. HI THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO ME.

AW I CANNOT GET THROUGH THE DAY I CANNOT GET THROUGH THE WEEK. WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A SMALL BUSINESS SO I WANT TO BRING IT HOME AND ADD TO THOSE NUMBERS. I WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT MY SPOUSE BEING A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY IS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND HER BUSINESS THANK GOODNESS -- SO I WANT PEOPLE TO STOP AND THINK AND AND THINK ABOUT THE DATA AND THE NUMBERS IN A WAY THAT IS MEANINGFUL TO US. MY GLASSES MIGHT AYE DOCTOR IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER MY DENTIST IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I HAVE A GREAT HEALTH PLAN I GO TO KAISER. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE I HAVE KNOWN FOR TWENTY AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW I'M OLDER. I'VE HAD MY EYE DOCTOR FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE HAD MY DENTIST.

FROM THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION MS MITCHELL THANK YOU. ANYONE THAT'S EVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY -- THAT WOMAN IS SERIOUS AND SHE WILL BRING IN A NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES TO YOUR DISTRICT OFFICE.

THANK YOU PER TO MACHEN'S WE NOW LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR STONE. GOOD MORNING SIR. GOOD MORNING MR PRESIDENT AND A AND COLLEAGUES I WANT TO APPLAUD THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD AND I WANT TO THANK THE PRO TEM FOR HER. HER WONDERFUL REMARKS -- YOU KNOW I BEEN A SMALL BUSINESSMAN NOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS -- OWNED AND OPERATED. SIX PHARMACIES -- A RESPIRATORY COMPANY A PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY [inaudible] AND I WASN'T BORN ON THE RICH SIDE OF THE TRACKS I WAS BORN IN A VERY HUMBLE LOW INCOME FAMILY BLUE COLLAR WORKERS AND FIRST GUY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE IN MY FAMILY AND I KNEW I WANTED TO BE A SOLE PROPRIETOR. BUT I KNEW THAT I JUST COULDN'T GO AND FIX RISE A NEW STORE AND BUY INVENTORY IN OPEN THE PHARMACY BY MYSELF. SO I HAD TO WAIT. FOR BIG BIG BOX STORES THAT TIME PROBABLY BEFORE MANY OF YOU WERE BORN ONE CALLED FED MARK ONE CALLED. GEMCO. AND WHEN THEY THE COM BY I BOTTLE THEIR PHARMACY FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT PUT HIM IN STORAGE AND AND THEN THE SMALL TOWN OF TEMECULA NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. I WANTED TO OPEN. MY FIRST OF SIX PHARMACIES. I WANT TO HAVE THE CHEERS BAR OF A PHARMACY WE YOUR UNIVERSITIES NAME THE WALKED IN THE DOOR. INCLUDING THE LIKES OF JACK KLUGMAN YOU MAY EMEMBER HIM IN THE QUINCY SHOW THAT ALSO LIVED IN TEMECULA I WAS THIS PHARMACIST AND PROBABLY. SERVE HIM AND MY OTHER CONSTITUENTS AND BUILD PRACTICES UP. THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM THIS -- BEING ABLE. TO COME FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS AND GO TO SCHOOL. AND THE GREATEST SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND BECOME A SUCCESS. AND I TRY TO PATRONIZE -- SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE OUR OUR PRO TEM HAS A EXEMPLIFIED. OUR DOG GROOMERS -- THE GOING TO THE SAME PSYCHIATRIST FOR TWENTY YEARS -- SAME DOCTORS -- BUT I'D SAY A MENTION THIS I ALSO WANT. TO PUT A CAUTION OUT THERE. THAT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BILLS ESPECIALLY BILLS THAT ARE? ENTERTAINING THE LABOR COMMITTEE AND AND OTHER BILLS THAT ARE ADDING MORE REGULATIONS AND MORE COSTS. IT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY. IMPOSED ON SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS I WILL TELL YOU THAT. THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING COUNT HOUNDING PHARMACY WHICH I OWN NOW AND STILL OPERATE. AB EXPONENTIALLY INCREASED OVER THE PAST DECADE IN RESPONSE TO SOME UNFORTUNATE EVENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN. ON THE EAST COAST AT A PHARMACY THAT DIDN'T SET THE GOOD EXAMPLE SET THE BAD EXAMPLE WHICH CAUSE KNEE JERK REACTIONS TO HAPPEN THROUGHOUT. THE COUNTRY. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY NOT ONLY IN THE COUNTRY. AND THAT WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED. AND TO ALLOW. THE DREAM OF OWNING ONE'S BUSINESS AND GIVING THEM THE TOOLS TO BE THE ENTREPRENEURS. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN. FOR SO AGAIN I WANT TO APPLY THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AND JUST HOPE THAT. AS WE ENTERTAIN MY DISTILLATION. IMPORTANT LEGISLATION IN THE COMING MONTHS THAT WE WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THOSE EFFECTS WOULD BE ON SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. AND COMPETE NOT ONLY IN A NATIONAL WORK FORCE BUT IN A GLOBAL WORK FORCE AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER STONE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO CENTER HUESO. AND THEN TO SENATOR PAN BORN INCINERATION. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS YOU ARE. FORTY SEVEN SMALL BUSINESS CONTINUES TO BE THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA 98%. OF OUR ECONOMY OR ARE 90% OF THE BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE OR FEEL BY SMALL BUSINESS. AND THEY RATE CONTINUE TO BE THE SITE WHERE. INNOVATION IS BORN IN OUR STATE THIS THE PLACE WHERE. NEW IDEAS -- COME TO BE. AND WHERE THE AMERICAN DREAM BEGINS FOR FOR MANY PEOPLE -- INCLUDING MYSELF I STARTED MY FIRST BUSINESS WHEN I WAS TWELVE% YEARS OLD I HAD A LITTLE CAR WASH BUSINESS ADEQUATE CORNER. GAS STATION AND AFTER THAT I STARTED DELIVERING NEWSPAPERS EVERY MORNING AT FOUR AM THE SAN DIEGO UNION -- THE I HAD A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT CUSTOMERS AT THAT I WOULD GET UP AT FOUR IN THE MORNING RIDE MY BIKE FROM MY NEIGHBOR DELIVERING PAPERS. AND I THOUGHT. MY MY WHOLE LIFE WOULD BE RESIDENT AROUND BUSINESS AND IT JUST -- IS A WONDERFUL THING TO BE YOUR OWN BOSS EVERYDAY. BUT YOU KNOW THE THE BIGGEST THING FACING THE BIGGEST THREAT FACING BUT AS BUSINESS ON OUR STATE CONTINUES TO BE MONOPOLIES. IT CONTINUES TO BE OF A TAX BREAKS FOR THE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE NOT GIVEN TO SMALL BUSINESS IT CONTINUES TO BE. REGULATIONS THAT FAVOR LARGER. MORE WELL FUNDED CORPORATIONS AND OVER OVER SMALL BUSINESS AND THAT'S I THINK THE BIGGEST THREAT AS A AS A BUSINESS OWNER -- IN CALIFORNIA FOR A FOR TWENTY YEARS. I CAN TELL YOU THE BIGGEST THREAT. IT IS IS IT'S NOT REGULATION REGULATION OFTEN IS IS. ENCOURAGED BY BUSINESSES CENTER TOOK. CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO EVERYBODY COULD KEEP COMPETE EQUAL. EQUALLY TO HAVE AN EQUAL ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN DREAM BUT IF YOU START FAVOR IN. THE BIG COMPANIES IF YOU START PROVIDING THEM WITH WITH OF WITH REGULATIONS GIVE THEM. PREFERENCE OVER. OF DOMINATING THE THE ECONOMIC. ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA KILL SMALL BUSINESS IN OUR STATE. SO AS WE EVOLVE AS WE CELEBRATE ALL THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND. BUT ALSO CONTINUE TO SEND THAT MESSAGE TO PEOPLE THAT WE CALIFORNIA IS THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY IN THE NATION. BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE THAT ENVIRONMENT FOR INNOVATION WITHOUT IT WE ARE THAT ENVIRONMENT. FOR INVESTMENT. 70% OF OF ALL THE OF NEW. INVESTMENT CAPITAL THAT IS SPENT. IN AMERICA OF OF OF OF A 100% OF ALL START UP CAPITAL FUNDS 70% COMES TO CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A REASON WHY THAT IS. THERE'S A REASON WHY WE DOMINATE THE INVESTMENT -- OF OF THE THE INTEREST OF THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. CONTINUES TO BE THE PLACE. WHERE BUSINESS START UPS? WANT TO WHERE WHERE BUSINESSES WANT TO BEGIN. THIS IS THE PLACE I WANT TO BE LOCATED OVER OVERWHELMINGLY THIS IS A PLACE WE CONTINUE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE THE INCUBATOR. THE BUSINESS INCUBATOR OF AMERICA AND WE HAVE. TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT AND WE HAVE TO PROTECT THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO SUPPORT POLICIES THAT -- MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR OUR STATE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER HUESO MEMBERS VETERAN FLORIDA SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH -- PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIENDS FROM BALDWIN PARK IN SAN DIEGO FOR BRING THIS RESOLUTION FORD STAND STRONG SUPPORT -- IT DO YOU HAVE TO FEEL COMPELLED SPEAK BECAUSE MY WIFE IS A WOMAN OF COLOR HAS AN IMMIGRANTS WHO START A SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE STILL RUNS THAT -- BUSINESS TODAY AND SHE'S -- AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO START THAT BUSINESS -- NOW FRANKLY YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE THE OWNER OF A SMALL BUSINESS YOU'RE STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS YEAR LAST ONE TO GET PAID. RIGHT YOU GOT TO PAY YOUR RENT YOU GOT PAID UNTIL IT EASY PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES. AND SOMETIMES YOU'RE BEGINNING JOAN POCKET IN THE VERY BEGINNING IN ORDER TO MAKE. ENDS MEET SO THAT YOUR BUSINESS CAN CONTINUE AND CLEARLY YOU ALSO INTERACT WITH ALL OF YOUR EMPLOYEES AS WELL. AND HAVE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM AND THEIR YOUR PART YOUR EXTENDED FAMILY AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS SMALL BUSINESS I THINK I THINK THAT AGAIN WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE VERY IMPORTANT ROLE SMALL BUSINESS PLATE. AS AN ECONOMIC ENGINE BUT ALSO CREATION OF OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IS THAT THE VERY GROUPS. TO LOOK IS IT STARTING SMALL BUSINESSES AND CERTAINLY THAT ENTREPRENEURS. WHAT DROVE THEM BUT OFTENTIMES OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY EQUALLY THERE FOR THEM IN LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE MANY -- YEAH AND YOU SEE WOMEN YOU SEE PEOPLE COLOR IS HIS IMMIGRANTS STARTING A BUSINESS IS I DO WANT TO JUST MENTION -- THAT ACTUALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TO ACTUALLY ALLOW AND PERMIT PEOPLE TO BE MORE ENTREPRENEURS HERE BECAUSE WE PASSED COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND ACTUALLY THERE IS DATA SHOW THAT BY ACTUALLY ARE IN OUR EMBRACE OF THE ACA INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL STABILIZING THE INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE MARKET WE'VE HELPED PEOPLE GET OUT OF WHAT'S CALLED JOB LOCK. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ABLE IF YOU HAVE A CHRONIC CONDITION. YOU CAN'T GO BY INSURANCE AND INDIVIDUAL MARKET BECAUSE THE PRE EXISTING CONDITION AFFORDABLE INSURANCE AND GO OFF AND PURSUE YOUR DREAMS AS AN ENTREPRENEUR. AND FACT WE HAVE SEEN A NOTICEABLE TAKE UPWARDS AND PEOPLE WILLING TO BE ABLE TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF COVERED CALIFORNIA. SO I SHOULD MAKE NOTE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS WE CERTAINLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT REGULATIONS AND LAWS AND HOW DO WE MAKE IT EASIER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE I KNOW SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. I KNOW THEY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING THEY OFTEN THOSE ARE CLARITY FROM US YOU KNOW THEY WANT CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER DAY WHAT THEIR WORK IS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THEY WANT CLEARLY FROM US HOW TO DO IT. BUT THEY ALSO NEED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THINGS LIKE COVERED CALIFORNIA TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THAT INDEPENDENCE THAT FREEDOM. TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL DREAMS I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER AND MEMBERS WITH A TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR AWESOME. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU -- THE PRESIDENT -- I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT AND THANK SENATOR -- FROM BALDWIN PARK ON THE ISSUE OF SMALL BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID ALSO ARE IN POOR WAY FOR IMMIGRANTS TO INTEGRATE INTO THE ECONOMY. AND MANY MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR VIBRANCY BECAUSE OF IMMIGRANTS OPENING AND STARTING AND MAINTAINING SMALL BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES -- THAT DO GIVE THE KINDS OF WAGES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR FAMILIES TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES -- LIKE LANGER IS WORLD FAMOUS LET WORLD FAMOUS LANGER'S DELICATESSEN UP TO LEAVE THE ORIGINAL IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES THE PANTRY. THOSE ARE JUST THREE OF THE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE SUSTAINED OUR COMMUNITIES AGAINST MANY MANY ODDS. AND AT THE SAME TIME A PROVIDED GOOD FAMILY WAGES FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES SO. WE SHOULD EQUATE -- SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENCOURAGE AND HELP THEM TO ALSO BE IN A POSITION TO PAY THOSE KINDS OF WAGES THAT REALLY LIFT AND DEFEND AND PROTECT -- GOOD COMMUNITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER. MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR JACKSON GOOD MORNING CENTER JACKSON YES THANK YOU -- MISS PRESENT COLLEGE I WANT TO STAND UP AND AND AGAIN THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN. OF PARK. AS WELL AS OUR PRO TEM FOR SHARING WITH US. WHAT COMPRISES HER DAILY ROUTE -- OR WEEKLY ROUTINE -- SO THAT I CAN TRY TO EMULATE THAT. ALTHOUGH THE SIX THIRTY THE MORNINGS A LITTLE EARLY -- FOR SOME OF US. BUT I WANT TO FOCUS IF I MAY ON WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES -- BECAUSE WE ARE FINDING NOW THAT -- BETWEEN -- IN A STUDY BY AMERICAN EXPRESS FOUND THAT BE FROM NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES. GREW BY 44% BUT THE NUMBER OF WOMEN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES GREW BY A HUNDRED AND 14% A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN OF COURSE -- IN CALIFORNIA AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT -- THE OUR STATE'S REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES IS 15% HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE NEW WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES OPEN IN CALIFORNIA EVERY DAY. AND THE BIGGEST HURDLE THAT BOTH. OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES RUN BY MEN AND WOMEN FACE IS FINANCING. AND THAT WOMEN HAVE OF A GREATER OBSTACLES IN OBTAINING THAT FINANCING SO AS WE LOOK -- TO FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALL OF THE CLAIMS ABOUT WHAT CAUSES PROBLEMS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. IT'S THAT INITIAL START UP FUNDING. AND AS WOMEN WANT THAT FLEXIBILITY IN OWNING THEIR OWN BUSINESSES THE NEEDS TO ACCOMMODATE AND BALANCE CHILD CARE. OF THE FAMILY NEEDS AND THE DESIRE AND THE NEED TO OBTAIN I ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ARISE WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE MORE AND MORE WOMEN STEPPING INTO THE ENTREPRENEURIAL WORLD. AND IT IS A VERY EXCITING TO HEAR OF THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT WRLD LET'S HOPE THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE. THE ABILITY IN THE FLEXIBILITY DECISION MAKING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE KEEPING CALIFORNIA LIFE AND LIVING THE GRAY CALIFORNIA DREAM. AND WITH THAT I WOULD URGE YOUR STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. SENATORS WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. LAST CALL FOR DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER RUBIO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ON MY COLLEAGUES FOR STANDING UP IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R.. FORTY SEVEN IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- WITH KNOWLEDGE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES AND I WILL CLOSE WITH THIS IF I MAY SHARE WHEN I WAS A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER I WAS 1100% CERTAIN. THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES ALLOWED US TO EXPAND OUR PRORAMS. CHILD STEP CITY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS OUR SENIORS HAVE PLACES TO GO EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF THEIR TAX REVENUE. AND IN ADDITION THEY ALLOWED US TO TAKE CARE OF OUR S. YEAH YOU FAMILY OUR PUBLIC SAFETY FAMILIES AND SO WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO BE MINDFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE NEED. TO ALWAYS KEEP THEM IN MIND THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS BIG BABIES THEY CAN BE IN ALL SMALL BUT THEY'RE VERY MIGHTY IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WITH THAT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.
