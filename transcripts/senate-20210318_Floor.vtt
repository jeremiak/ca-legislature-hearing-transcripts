YOU LOOK AT THE BIO. THAT OCCUR-

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:44.136
BASED ON. AN INACCURATE WEIGHT

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.572

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.602
UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:18.938

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.453
EFFECTIVE SO THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.388
HAVE LOSS OF WAGES. BUT THIS IS

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:38.257
NOT THE ANSWER. BECAUSE THIS

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:39.658
RETROACTIVITY IN THIS BILL IS

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:41.827

AND WE WANT TO STOP THE SPREAD.

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:15.060

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:15.828
FOR OUR STRUGGLING BUSINESSES

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:17.830

BECAUSE EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING IT

THE COST OF THAT LEAVE IS

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.628
DEDUCTED FROM THE PAYROLL TAX

IS NOT AN INCOME TAX CREDIT

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.268
WHICH OF COURSE WOULD CAUSE A

OF THEM HAVE INCOME TAX LOSSES

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:37.483

THE RIGHT TO CURE ISN'T WHEN

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:30.435
THIS BILL PASSES THE RIGHT TO

THIS HOUSE I WOULD SUGGEST

THAT. BUT I THINK THIS IS A

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:53.659
COMPROMISE BETWEEN TWO. MANY

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:54.793
MANY ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.128

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:22.147
FISCAL REVIEW.

00:21:59.384 --> 00:21:59.818
THE ANSWER IS

00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:01.720
THAT THIS IS- THIS IS A BUDGET

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:05.090
BILL. AND THIS WAS INTRODUCED

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.458
BEFORE THE COMMITTEES WERE

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:09.528
ESTABLISHED AND THAT HEADING

00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:12.998
IS- IT WAS NOT CHANGED IN THE

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.633
AND IN THE ASSEMBLY IT THIS IS

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:20.405
A BUDGET BILL. LEON I RAISE

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:23.075
THIS OF CARLA BECAUSE THE

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.243

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.179
WHAT WE'RE DOING ON POLICY

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:29.247
ISSUES AND WHEN WE- ARE KIND OF

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:31.283
SIDESTEPPING I UNDERSTAND WHEN

00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:34.086
THE QUILL BID- SITUATION. BUT I

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:36.088
WOULD NORMALLY MOVE ON THAT WE

00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:37.723
TAKE THIS THE SENATE RULES

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:38.557
COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF THE

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:39.958
VIOLATION OF THE JOINT RULES

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.126
THAT WE STILL OPERATE UNDER

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.527
ADOPTED LAST YEAR AND NOT

00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:44.563
CHANGE THIS YEAR. DUE TO THE

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:46.431
TIMING THAT WE HAVE ON ALL OUR

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:48.033
COMMITTEES I'M GOING TO PASS

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.801
THIS TIME WHAT I WOULD ASK THE

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.069
IN THE FUTURE THAT WE FOLLOW

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.070
THE RULES AND IF WE'RE NOT

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:54.005
GOING TO DO THAT THAT THIS BODY

00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:55.807
IS ALERTED TO THAT. AT THAT

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:57.776
MOMENT BECAUSE WHAT ARE THE

00:22:57.843 --> 00:23:04.316
GOOD SENATOR FROM- SITTING. IN

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:05.350
FRONT OF ME. HE MENTIONED THAT

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:07.853
THE IS A- IS WE CAN. TO DEBATE

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:09.621
ON THIS FLOOR IS PAULA. THAT IS

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:12.524
BEING PUT THROUGH A BY BILL A

00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:13.091
TRAILER BILL AND WE WILL GET

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.659
INTO THAT LATER IN THE SET. AND

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:16.928

I UNDERSTAND WE ARE OPERATING

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.698
UNDER COALBED WE'RE MAKING

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:21.032
EXCEPTIONS AND I THINK THAT

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:23.101
THAT NEEDS TO BE VERY CLEAR.

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:24.202
BECAUSE WHEN WE GO BACK TO OUR

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:25.771
DISTRICTS. ESPECIALLY ON A BILL

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.839
LIKE THIS IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:29.808
VERY IMPACTFUL TO OUR

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.743

STAND UP OR OBJECTS TO A BILL

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:13.885
HOWEVER I THINK IT IS A PRO TO

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:16.621
SET RECORDS STE ST A SOME OF MY

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:20.058

QUARTERLY PAYROLL TAXES AND SO

00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:38.543
IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO TAKE A

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.545
CREDIT ON THOSE PAYROLL TAXES

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:42.681
AND IT IS WHY IT IS ALSO

00:24:42.747 --> 00:24:44.149

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:05.824
ABSOLUTELY BEST WAY TO CONTAIN

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.093
THE SPREAD BEYOND THE FACT OF

WEARING MASKS AS WE ARE.

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:12.197
KEEPING OUR DISTANCE IS TO

00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:13.965

RACISM AND HATE IN RECENT

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:32.376
YEARS. THE ALARMING RISE OF

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:34.478
WHITE NATIONALISM HAS COINCIDED

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:35.846
WITH AN INCREASE IN HATE DRIVEN

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:37.147
ATTACKS ON A NUMBER OF

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:39.283

PERPETRATED THEM. IT'S AN

00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:14.277
INTERESTING SET OF INDIVIDUALS.

WHO COMMIT THESE CRIMES THEY'RE

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:17.347
NOT CRIMES MOTIVATED BY AVARICE

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:20.083
OR PASSION. THEY'RE MOTIVATED

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:23.086
BY THE DESIRE TO SEND A MESSAGE

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:25.288

ON WHAT THEY THINK OTHERS THINK.

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.773
AND THEY LOOK FOR SUBTLE IN

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.141
IMPERCEPTIBLE MESSAGES

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:46.109
DELIVERED BY. THOSE IN

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:49.813

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:01.658
OF PEOPLE ARE RAPISTS AND

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:04.628
MURDERERS. THEY THINK THAT

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.963
OTHERS AGREE SO WHEN SOMEONE

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.567

AGREES WITH THEM. SO IT'S

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:29.252
IMPORTANT FOR US TO SPEAK WITH

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:32.789

THAT SOMEBODY CAN THINK. THAT

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.404
THEIR DISCOMFORT GIVES THEM THE

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:38.273
RIGHT. TO TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:38.907

DOMESTIC SOMEBODY WHO ABUSES

TO DO THAT WHEN THEY PUT THAT

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.219
PERSON LOWER THAN THEM WHEN

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:51.787
THAT PERSON IS LESS IMPORTANT

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:53.555
THAN THEY ARE. CAN THEY BEGIN

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:55.424
THEN TO STRIKE OUT SOMEHOW TO

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:56.592
MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER TO

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:57.960
MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER IF

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.595
THEY COULD PUSH SOMEBODY ELSE

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:00.462
DOWN IF THEY COULD HURT

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:02.197
SOMEBODY ELSE. THIS IS THE SAME

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:06.235
THING OUR SAYING INTERNAL- THAT

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:07.803
INTERNAL INADEQUACY THAT

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.404
INTERNAL ANGER THAT INTERNAL

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:11.907
BLAMING LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:13.542
BLAME. FOR WHERE YOU FIND

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:15.844
YOURSELF IN LIFE. AND WE SEE

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:16.745
THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:18.847
AGAIN. WE IDENTIFY ANOTHER

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:20.716
GROUP THAT YOU COULD SPEAK DOWN

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.384
ABOUT THAT YOU CAN TELL JOKES

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:23.852
ABOUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.420
PEOPLE DON'T CALL YOU ON IT.

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.456
AND THEN WE SEE IT LEAD TO THIS

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:29.258
ULTIMATE ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:30.259
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:31.660
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:35.998
ROOT OUT AT EVERY. STEP WE CAN.

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:38.367
TO BE ABLE TO. TO IF YOU HEAR A

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:40.535
JOKE TO SPEAK AGAINST IT

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:41.203
BECAUSE THE ACT OF WHAT

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.005
SOMEBODY IS DOING. IS TAKING

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.573
THEIR OWN INTERNALIZED

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.408
INADEQUACY TO PROJECT ON TO

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.311
SOMEBODY ELSE. TO MAKE THEM

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.213
OKAY TO HURT THAT PERSON. AND

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.482
AS THE SENATOR FROM. SANTA ANA

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:55.918
SAID. IF WE DON'T SPEAK OUT

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:57.219
AGAINST IT THEY THINK WE WALK

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.787
WITH THEM. THEY THINK WE THINK

01:15:58.854 --> 01:15:59.855
THE SAME AS THEY DO THEY THINK

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.657
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS OKAY AND

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:03.792
SOMEHOW MAKES ALL OF US WHO

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:04.326
FEEL THAT WAY. BIGGER AND

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.762
BETTER. MAKE SAYS WORSE IT

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:09.865
MAKES A SMALL. I THINK ABOUT IT

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:10.832
THREE SAID WAS LIKE A CANCER I

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:11.633
THINK OF IT I'VE BEEN OUT

WORKING IN MY YARD IN THE

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.703

AND IT MUST BE TAKEN OUT. AND

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.744
WE TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S PAINFUL

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:25.080
TO GET IT OUT BUT YOU HAVE TO

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.315
CALL IT FOR WHAT IT IS. AND YOU
