A BILLION BUCKS FIRST YEAR TRANSITIONAL BURKE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR- CHAIR AND UP WITH ONE POINT. EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT- ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE FIRST YEAR AND OF COURSE INVESTMENTS TO HELP AS IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL.

HAVE BECOME IMPORTANT THAT SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS- MS OUR SCHOOL SITE YESTERDAY- WHERE THE FOOD SERVICE STAFF HAD- RECENTLY SERVE SOME FORTY FIVE THOUSAND MEALS TO. OUR OUR STUDENTS AND SO ON THAT NOTE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS BUDGET- AS ADDITIONAL DOLLARS INCLUDING FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT- OUR EFFORT TO CREATE UNIVERSAL MEALS. UP FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND OF COURSE THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT THAT IS PROPOSED. UP FOR STUDENTS- PROPOSALS TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND-YOU KNOW OF COURSE WE'RE ALL THINKING ABOUT DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND THAT THIS BUDGET WOULD. ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DISTRICTS THE USE THE HIGHEST AVERAGE OF THREE YEARS- TO HELP THEM SUSTAIN IT OFFSET- THE CHALLENGES- THAT YOU'RE- SEEING. IN DECLINE ENROLLMENT I LIKE TO JUST MENTION THAT THIS BUDGET REALLY DOES BUILD ON LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND- IF WE COULD JUST QUICKLY SHOW SCREENED OUT LIKE THAT. I JUST SHOW YOU A SHORT VISUAL THAT- HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE WAYS THAT- THIS PROPOSED BUDGET BILLS ON LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE- THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATIONIST HELPING TO IMPLEMENT. THAT WE CALL- THAT WE RECOGNIZE HAVING THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER- TO TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE TOP- UNIVERSAL MEALS- UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL PRO GRAM'S. RE BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUTER SCHOOL ALL KIND OF RAPPER SUPPORT. HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH SOCIAL SIR. AND ALSO PRO TO HELP AND THIS TO PRISON. OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ANTI RACISM GRANTS A FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN MENTAL HEALTH AND OF COURSE EXPANDED- LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT UNIVERSAL EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM SO. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE PROGRAMS TO HELP OUR SCHOOLS TO TRANSFORM BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO KEEP IN STATE. AND SO WE THINK OF IT IN THESE TERMS THAT WE HELP OUR STUDENTS TO- TO- RECOVER FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE PANDEMIC- AND THEN TO RECOVER ACADEMICALLY ONE THE HEAL. FROM THE TRAUMA AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN A POSITION TO THRIVE AND SO YOU'LL HEAR US TALK THIS YEAR ABOUT LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE SPONSORING. THAT CAN HELP US IN THAT WAY- WE THINK THAT ONE OF OUR TOP ORDERS BUSINESS HAS TO BE SUPPORTING THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. AND THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR US TALKING ABOUT A NEW PROPOSAL- THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO- ULTIMATELY RECRUIT TEN THOUSAND ONE MENTAL HEALTH. CLINICIANS TO SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS IT'S NO MYSTERY WE HAVE. A SHORTAGE WE WILL WORK WITH SHORTAGE IN EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR IN THE WHOLE US THERE'S A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IN EVERY EMPLOYMENT SECTOR. AND SO WE WILL BE WE BOB SPONSORING LEGISLATION- THAT WOULD GENERATE REVENUE TO PROVIDE ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND BUT I HEALTH CONDITIONS WERE ALSO SPONSORED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO. RETAIN FIFTEEN THOUSAND TEACHERS WHO ARE TEACHING RIGHT NOW UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER- THEY NEED TO HAVE ADDITIONAL INDUCTION- DONE TO COMPLETE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. WE KNOW THAT OUR TOP WATER BUSINESS HAS TO BE- BUILDING OUT OUR STAFF. EVEN IF. I'M HOSTING A PART OF THE MANY MEETINGS THAT IS FOCUSED ON HOW WE CLOSE OUR STAFF SHORTAGE REVOKE A SINGLE WHERE DID THESE FOLKS GO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T RETURNED. TO THE EDUCATION FIELD WHERE DID THEY GO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT EITHER. THESE COMPENSATION BILL THE PATHWAY. BUILT MORE TRAINING TO GET MORE TEACHERS WHAT DRIVERS AND SO WILL BE A WORKING ON ALL OF THESE. WILL BE WORKING ON THINGS THAT WE WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS THRIVE. BUT OUR TOOL LANGUAGE. IMMERSION PROGRAM. RESPONSIBLE THIS YEAR THAT WILL ALLOW OUR SCHOOLS TO CONVERT- INTO DUAL LANGUAGE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW THAT LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. IS SET UP. TO HELP SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS TO BE GLOBAL THINKERS S. SUPPORTS THAT SHE'D MET. WE BELIEVE THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT MANY FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO INVEST. IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN THEY SEE THAT MORE OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE TOOL LANGUAGE PROGRAM SO WE SUBMIT THESE- I THOUGHT TO YOU- ABOUT THE CURRENT BUDGET WE THINK THAT THERE ARE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES. TO DO MORE- AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR IN THE MONTHS TO COME. ON HOW THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL- GETS THAT DISCUSSED AND DEBATED. AND HOW WE CANNOT FINE TUNING. OUT TO HAVE A FINAL BUDGET IN MAY- THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS. TO HEAL- OF THE TRAUMA THE PANDEMIC. ALL RIGHT TO BE COVERED IN TERMS OF LEARNING GAPS IN LEARNING LOST. IT TO THRIVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE HELP TO ACCELERATE THEIR LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT ONE FOUR. ALSO APPEARED AS THE CHAIR AND DESK MAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY. OKAY THANK. ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE CLASS FOR THIS AND MISTER MY- DEGREE DEGREE TO HAVE YOU WITH US THIS MORNING- AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE SAW MONEY- ALLOCATED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION AND- DOES THAT MAKE. AND IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING. GLAZER FIRST TIME IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO HELP- SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IMPLEMENTED AND TRAIN THEIR TEACHERS TO- TEACH US THAT AND WHAT IS NEEDED. AND YOU'RE YOU'RE ON MUTE THEIR- OWN. OKAY. HELLO. THERE WE GO TRY AGAIN SIMILARLY WHEN YOU ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN DID ARE WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR THE QUESTION. NOW TWENTY YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION. I WAS BUT BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY I'M NOT SURE THAT ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HEARD THE QUESTION- BUT- YOU GET TO YOUR POINT ABOUT- ETHNIC STUDIES- OUR OFFICE HAS ALREADY- IS AIRING A RELEASE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS TO- SOLICIT- COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THAT WILL SUPPORT THE PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON HOW DISTRICTS WILL BUILD UP THEIR- NECKS STUDIES- CURRICULUM SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. ON THIS AND NOTE THAT STEPS ARE IN THE WORKS TO HELP OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUILD OUT THEIR OWN VERSIONS OF ETHICS THAT. I AND I THINK. THE SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION- THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING AGAIN THAT THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WAS JUST THE FIRST INSTALLMENT. OF I WOULD THINK THAT MORE MONEY IS NEEDED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING ASK MY STAFF TO DO THE SAME WITH ME TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY- DIRECTOR OF REFERENCES TO INVESTMENTS AND SPECIAL AND AN ETHNIC STUDIES THERE ARE INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE BUILDING OUT OF OTHER CURRICULA- IN PARTICULAR- NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES- A CAMBODIAN AND VIETNAMESE- STUDY CURRICULA- I WILL CHECK MY NOTES HERE TO DO ANYTHING SPECIFIC TO THE OVERALL BROAD CATEGORIES ABOUT THAT OKAY I WOULD THINK THAT DISTRICTS CAN I HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO AND THEY'RE GONNA NEED HELP AND SUPPORT SO. WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SUCCESSFUL AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL. IT IS LOCAL OF THAT IS SORT OF IN ABSOLUTELY I THINK THERE ARE STILL DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS TAKING PLACE ABOUT. WHAT IS HAPPENING STUDIES AGAIN AS WE'RE BUILDING ON LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- I NOTICED I NOTED THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADDRESSING ANTI RACISM. OF PROGRAMS I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- DOLLARS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED TO EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT. OR UP EDUCATED WORKFORCE GRANTS THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS IMPLICIT BIAS- YOU KNOW WE'RE PARTNERING. WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING- THAT HAS- A FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT SCHOLARSHIPS. THAT CAN BE USED TO HELP DIVERSIFY THE TEACHER WORKFORCE AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. AGAIN THAT COULD BE USED TO HELP- VERSIFI THE WORK FORCE AND SO- WOULD CERTAINLY WORKING TO PUT ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER- TO SUPPORT- MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS GET ACCESS. INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HERITAGE IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE RANSOM THURSDAY AS A RELAY SAY THAT NEXT THAT. AND THAT WE HAVE WAYS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF RACISM THAT HAVE IMPACTED AND PRESENTED. HERE'S TO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR I'M SO THAT WE'RE GIVING EVERYONE A CHANCE THAT. EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD BE THE CHANCE YOU HAVE A CHANCE. TO GET A GREAT EDUCATION A MOVEMENT. THANK YOU TO BRING AND THEN I WILL WILL FOLLOW UP WE YOUR OFFICE. AS WELL. WELL MY SURE TO CIRCLE BACK WITH THE THANK YOU A MEMBER THANK YOU OKAY SOMEONE RENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU- STATE SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS TODAY AND YOUR COMMITMENTS AYE I WILL TELL YOU THAT. IF IT WERE REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN OUR STUDENTS. MOST ESPECIALLY OUR SPECIAL ED YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT NUTRITION PER STATE PRESCHOOL FOSTER YOUTH ARE ADULTS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. THESE ARE ALL POSITIVE THINGS THAT DID THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET AS A RESULT OF THIS INVESTMENT. SOME OF MY CONCERNS AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE ADDRESSED THEM HERE AND I'VE HEARD YOU SPEAK BEFORE. BUT DECLINING ENROLLMENT IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS AFFECTING MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. AND THE LACK OF DATA AND COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THESE TRENDS. THE SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS- THE BUT I THINK ANOTHER AREA AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE GROWING OPPORTUNITY GAPS AND THAT THE STUDENT DISENGAGEMENT THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT AGAIN ARE AFFECTING OUR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY. K. THROUGH TWELVE. HOURS WE KNOW TRUMP'S FROM THE DATA THAT WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE REVIEWED. THESE SORTS OF THINGS AFFECT OUR- STUDENTS OF COLOR AND OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS MORE THAN ANY ANYONE ELSE. SO I APPRECIATE I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU DO TO UPLIFT. OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. AND MY QUESTION HAS TO DO SPECIFICALLY WITH THE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS THIS LACK OF DATA AND COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE TRENDS OF THE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND THE CLERK DECLINING ENROLLMENT. DO YOU HAVE ANY UPDATES ON WHAT WE'RE DOING TO TRY TO GATHER THIS DATA AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. THANK YOU MAJORITY LEADER FOR- WAR OF RAISING THESE ITEMS AND I'M FINDING IT A LITTLE BIT IS CERTAINLY ON THE MINDS. OF ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS AND I KNOW OUR LEGISLATIVE PARTNERS- FOR US AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT. AND YOU KNOW IN SOME PLACES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME SMALL PILOTS TO DO SOME OUTREACH TO FAMILIES THAT UP TO TRYING TO ME AGE THEM. USING FAMILY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND HOME VISITING AND SOME OF US HAVE BEEN GRANT SUPPORTED WE'VE BEEN UNDER EXCUSE ME GRANTS THE RECIPE FOUNDATION. ALLOWS TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH DISTRICTS LIKE INGLEWOOD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- TO DO SOME FAMILY ENGAGEMENT ON VISITING SPECIFICALLY AROUND FAMILIES THAT JUST WE'RE STUDENTS JUST NEVER CHECKED IN- INTO WORK TO OFFSET- THE HELP THOSE- IN ROAMING ISSUES- OF COURSE. WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET TO GIVE DISTRICTS THE ABILITY- TO CHOOSE THE YOU KNOW- THAT ONE EIGHTY YEARS OF THE HIGHEST EIGHTY EIGHT- OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. WILL HELP TO BOLSTER DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AS WE GO FORWARD- THIS YEAR- BUT THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT THAT IS PROJECTED. FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS TO COME AND I KNOW THAT YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS FROM THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THERE HAVE BEEN PROJECTIONS THAT. POPULATION ISSUES AND GROWTH AND DECLINE- THAT WE'LL BE SEEING MORE DECLINING ENROLLMENT- THERE ARE GREAT PROPOSALS- THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY SCHOOLS IF APPROVED THIS YEAR- THERE ARE pTHE WAY SCHOOLS RECEIVE FUNDING- FOUR FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT AND THAT THE- OF A GREAT PROPOSAL- THAT WOULD CONVERT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FROM EIGHTY EIGHT BASED SYSTEM- AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE BASED SYSTEM. TO AN ENROLLMENT BASE SYSTEM- AND THAT WOULD HAVE DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY HAVE TO BE COMMITTED OF THE PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THAT I'M REFERENCING WOULD REQUIRE. 50% OF THE ADDITIONAL ON THAT DISTRICTS RECEIVE. WOULD HAVE TO GO TO EFFORTS TO ADDRESS- A CHRONIC GAPS. A BIG FAN OF THIS PROPOSAL- THE TALKING SCHOOL. ASSOCIATION SENATOR PORTANTINO OFF THIS LETTER- IT THEM WE INTEND TO SUPPORTED AND SPONSORING IN ANY WAY WE CAN. DO THAT YOU KNOW- META MCCARTY I SPENT QUITE A LOT TEN. TRYING TO FIGURE WAYS HELP OUR- ADDRESS CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM BUT WE THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS SELECTED. WOULD PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE STEADY. REVENUE TO OFFSET THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT TRENDS THAT WE SEE AN IMPORTANT. RESOURCES TO- HELP GET THOSE FAMILIES BACK IN SCHOOL AND. TO ADDRESS A CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. THANK YOU SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL I THANK YOU MISTER CHARGES ONE OF AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER THURMAN FOR BEING HERE AND I THINK THAT- THAT BILL WITH REGARD TO- WHETHER WE GO EIGHTY A OR ENROLLMENT- IS GOING TO REQUIRE MORE CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT MAY IN FACT BE CREATING ANOTHER CATEGORICAL WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ARE TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM HER HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM- BUT I JUST. YOU KNOW I'M HEARING A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY HISTORICA STORE HISTORIC. IN A HISTORIC INVESTMENTS WILL TO FIVE POINT THREE THREE PERCENT. ADDITION COLA UNDERBASE RIGHT. IN AN ERA WHERE WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT FOUR. PERCENT PLUS INFLATION. RIGHT OR IN AN ERA WHERE WE HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND HIGHER STUDENT NEEDS. THAN WE EVER HAVE AND THAT GOES FOR ALL STUDENT POPULATIONS IN OUR K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. SO I JUST YOU KNOW AS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HISTORICAL STORIES STORK I JUST WANT THEM TO REMEMBER THAT THERE. IS ALSO SOME OTHER THINGS SOME OTHER FACTORS IN HERE THAT ARE IMPACTING OUR BUDGETS THAT ARE VERY HISTORIC AS WELL. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBERS ON ALL AND WE WE DO HAVE A- THE FINANCE DELEO IN OTHERS IT'S AND MR THURMAN'S DEPARTMENT TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL BUDGET PROPOSALS BUT- QUESTION OR COMMENT FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT MISTER GALLAGHER. YEAH JUST A QUICK FOLLOW U ON- MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IT ONE THING I HAVE BEEN HEARING QUITE A BIT FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IS I MEAN CERTAINLY THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY WAS VERY HELPFUL- BUT THERE IS THIS FEELING THAT WERE ALMOST CREATING CATEGORICAL IS AGAIN. AND THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- FOR EACH GRANT. ESPECIALLY ON LIKE SMALLER DISTRICTS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IS REALLY BURDENSOME. AND THEY AND WANT ONE SUGGESTION THAT THEY'VE MADE TO ME AND I THINK MAY MAKE SENSE IS WHY NOT JUST HAVE THIS BE ALL PART OF THE L. CAP- SO IT'S KIND OF ALL INCLUSIVE AND THAT YOU'RE DOING IT ONE TIME. AND YOU'RE HAVING TO DO IT FOR SEVERAL. DIFFERENT THINGS CERTAINLY WANT ACCOUNTABILITY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY'S BEING. YOU KNOW SPENT TO KEEP KIDS IN SCHOOL AND DEAL WITH THE THINGS- THE OTHER THING WE'VE IDENTIFIED BUT- YOU KNOW WE COULD BE CREATED A WHOLE NOTHER. ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND PROBLEM- THAT TAKES AWAY FROM. PROVIDE EDUCATION TO KIDS- SO I THINK. THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD MAYBE THINK ABOUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU GUYS HAVE DISCUSSED- MISTER SUPERINTENDENT- BUT MAYBE YOU COULD A GUY STYLE LITTLE BIT. THANK IS A MEMBER GALLAGHER IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS BE IMPLEMENTED ON A FORMAL BASIS- RATHER THAN- PUTTING DISHES IN A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE TO. APPLY FOR GRANTS AND THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH THE EDUCATED WORKFORCE GRANT WE LOVE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN WITH FUTURE ALLOCATIONS UP FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THERE'S NOT- THE PRESSURE ON OUR SMALL DISTRICTS THAT ARE RULE DISTRICTS. THAT DON'T HAVE GRANT WRITING STAFF THAT DON'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY- TO BE. CHASING DOWN GRANTS YEAH THAT DOES REQUIRE SOME LEGISLATIVE ACTION BUT WE THINK THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRANTS TO BE IMPLEMENTED AWAY. BASED ON FORMULAS BASED ON- YOU'LL NEED BASED ON NEED CATEGORIES LIKE- BUT THIS PATIENT OR A PERCENTAGE OF MUCH PROGRAM- YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF YOUTH- LIVING IN POVERTY WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THAT- WE THINK THAT THERE ARE. WAYS TO ALSO- THE ARE GREAT INITIAL WE WANT TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING WEIGHTED DOWN ON DISTRICTS AND SO WE- KNOW IF YOU TAKE. IT AS AN EXAMPLE THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE. YOU'VE REACHED OUT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SAY TALK WITH US ABOUT HOW THESE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED. IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE OF BENEFIT TO YOU AND NOT JUST. ONE MORE THINK WE USED TO HAVE TO- HAVE TO CHECK OFF ON THE BOX AND WE'VE HELD. MEETINGS WITH DISTRICTS NEED GIVING US FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS. MANAGEABLE YOU KNOW THE MCCARTY LEADER ASKED ABOUT HOW DO E DO MOREFAMILY ENGAGEMENT I CAN'T THINK OF ANY PROGRAM MORE FOR ITS- COMMUNITY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE TO HELP. PROMOTE THAT FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND I'M WILL BE DOING A TOWN HALLS WITH FAMILIES AND PARENTS UP THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I WOULD ALSO JUST- KNOWLEDGE THAT- WE BELIEVE THAT- ARE DISTRICTS WANT THESE PROGRAMS AND THEY WANT TO BE THOUGHT ONLY ONCE YOU GET FEEDBACK AND- I WILL DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO. YOU KNOW. MAKE IT THE GRANT PROCESS SEES MORE EFFICIENT- TO GET MORE FEEDBACK AND- BUT WE WITH THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED THAT THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE DISTRICTS WANT. WE HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE IMPLEMENT THEM. UP SO THAT THEY MEET THEIR NEEDS AND- WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THAT. IT'S ALL ACROSS THE STATE TO GET YOUR FEEDBACK ON HOW TO MAKE IT. TATIAN ACHIEVABLE. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY DARK. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR THE AGENDA REFLECTS THAT. ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY ONE OF THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE ELIGIBLE ALLEY AS CERTIFIED THAT THEIR SCHOOLS OFFERED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BY MAY FIFTEENTH AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEREBY QUALIFYING THEM FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS PROVIDED THROUGH EARLY BUDGET ACTION AND THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BY APRIL FIRST 202-020-2020 ONE THERE I. P. I. GRANTS WERE REDUCED BY 1% FOR EACH ADDITIONAL. INSTRUCTIONAL DAY UNTIL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WAS AVAILABLE SO WELL STUDENT SUCCESS IN MY MIND YOU THAT NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THESE FUNDS UP WELL STUDENTS ASSESSMENT DATA FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR IS LIMITED WE SHOULD BE EVALUATING STUDENT OUTCOMES ENGAGEMENT BASED ON THE FUNDING AND INSTRUCTIONAL OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AND THE CITY HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. FOR THE MAY REVISE SO HOW MUCH I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO ENSURE THAT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE T. T. K. AND I LIKE ADDING THE T. K. NOT JUST K. ANYMORE THE TWELVE EDUCATION ACTUALLY RESULT IN EDUCATIONAL GAMES ASSEMBLY MEMBER COREY I YEAH THAT'S GREAT QUESTIONS BUT WE PAUSE REAL QUICK BECAUSE THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT AND HE'S JUST GIVING OUR OVERVIEW. WE'RE GONNA GET THE GOVERNOR'S- PEOPLE HERE FROM DLF AND L. A. L. JUST A FEW SECONDS SO- ANY PARTING QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THAT SUPERINTENDENT. PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MR FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER- I Y. TO APPROVE YOU ACKNOWLEDGING THE WORK FORCE AND STAFFING CHALLENGES I THINK YOU. KIND OF ALLUDED TO THAT WHEN YOU SPOKE TO MY AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM- FROM THE NORTH STATE. BUT AS YOU DEVELOP PATHWAYS AND INITIATIVES- WILL IN DEALING WITH THE TEACHER SHORTAGE IN WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. I WONDER IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON THE INITIATIVES THAT YOU'RE ROLLING OUT ON HOW THEY APPLY OR WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM RURAL REGIONS RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND RURAL- SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN TERMS OF THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND TRYING TO ATTRACT- TALENTED TEACHERS INTO THEIR INTO THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BUT THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FONG I WOULD JUST SAY- THAT THE- BUT USES A PARALLEL OUR PROPOSAL TO RECRUIT TEN THOUSAND MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS. IS LARGELY BUILT WITH SMALL GROUP DISTRICTS IN MINE- AS YOU KNOW- NINETEEN OF OUR COUNTIES EXPERIENCED BUYER. LAST YEAR AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND TRY TO BRING SUPPORT TOO MANY OF THEM. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WAS ACCESS. THE COUNSELORS AND- COUNSELORS YOU CAN ADDRESS THE TRAUMA THAT MANY OF EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY'VE LOST THE HOME OFFICE SCHOOL MAYBE THE LOSS OF LOVED ONES. IT'S SO THIS PROPOSAL REALLY IS BUILT TO RECOGNIZED THAT MANY OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE HEALTHCARE- ACCESS ISSUES. AND TO BUILD A PIPELINE OF COUNSELORS WHO CAN WORK IN OUR RURAL AREAS SO WE LIKE TO DO THE SAME. AS WE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW TEACHERS AND BUS DRIVERS AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROPOSALS AGAIN AND THAT WOULD. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORTATION THAT COULD HELP US ADDRESS ISSUES AROUND RECRUITING MORE BUT PRIVATELY CLASSIFIED STAFF. BUT AGAIN AS I POINT OUT THIS MENTAL HEALTH PROPOSAL IT WAS LARGELY BUILT WITH THE RECOGNITION. THAT OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT HAD THE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER. STAFF THAT OUR SCHOOLS NEED AND AS WE LEAVE THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE THINKING ABOUT A RURAL COMMUNITIES AND URBAN AND SUBURBAN. COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ATTRACT THAT RESIDENTS TO THESE AREAS BY THE WAY THIS MIGHT HELP PROPOSAL I WOULD PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS THAT TO FOLKS. WHO COME MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND IT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO SERVE TWO YEARS IN A COMMUNITY OF HIGH NEED. CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THAT HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS REVITALIZED THAT DATA. AND IT'S A PART OF HOW WE BUILT THESE PROPOSALS HELP US ADDRESS OUR WORK WHICH WOULD BE. WELL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT- BUT YOU KNOW WE YOU AND I HAVE TALKED IN AND CERTAINLY THAT THE NEED FOR COUNSELING AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. THE ROLE REGION'S IS- IS DEFINITELY- NECESSARY ESPECIALLY WITH BUS DRIVERS. WITH A WE IS UP TO AND ALL OF THOSE. NEED SO IT IS CERTAINLY A BIG CHALLENGE- AS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH. HAS STATED OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT TODAY WITH A LOT BUT- I TO WORKING WITH YOU. YET TODAY WE'RE AS I MENTIONED TODAY. HOLDING UP. OF SEVERAL MEETINGS ON ADDRESSING WORKFORCE SHORTAGES WILL HAVE A NUMBER OF. OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM RURAL DISTRICTS PRESENTING. THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. WARS TRYING TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES FOR HOW TO HOW TO OFFSET THOSE TOWNS. OKAY QUESTION FOR MR SUPERINTENDENT MYSTIFIED RCS SORRY TO GO BACK TO MY QUESTION ABOUT THE ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY- SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY ONE ELEAZAR RECEIVED IN PERSON GRANTS WHO DO WE KNOW OR WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING TO SEE. EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY GRANT REPORTING AND WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION ARE WE EXPECTING RECEIVE I MEAN IS THERE GOING TO BE REPORTING ON WHETHER. THEY WERE JUST OPEN OR NOT OR OR THEIR METRICS IDENTIFIED AND HOW MANY STUDENTS WERE SERVED AND NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS OUR INELIGIBLE. FOR THE I. P. I. GRANTFUNDS.

THAT EDUCATION HAPPENS NOT JUST DURING THE CLASS DATE BUT BEFORE SCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL THAT REACH OUT TO OUR STAFF IN THE EXPANDED LEARNING DIVISION AND- THOSE WORKING ON UNIVERSAL MEALS HELPING OUR SCHOOLS BUILD OUT THESE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS.

IN THE BEGINNING OF OUR PRESENTATION- WITH A LARGE COLON LP ABOUT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES PRIORITIZE. THE LION'S SHARE OF ONGOING FUNDING TOWARDS EXISTING- PROGRAMS AND REALLY SOLIDIFYING THOSE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THAT WE NEED. TO CARRY OUT THEIR THEIR CORE FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS EXPAND- PRIORITIES SUCH A PROGRAM SUCH AS THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. PROGRAM WITH AN INCREASE OF THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SEVEN O'CLOCK PROGRAM AN ONGOING PROPAGATE FONG. BRING THE PROGRAM'S TOTAL FUNDING NOW TO FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS- OTHER INVESTMENTS FROM ONGOING FUNDS FOCUSED ON. THINGS LIKE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION- INCREASING ACTIVE JUNIPER SCHOOL MEALS- INCREASING SPECIAL EDUCATION BASED FUNDING. AS WELL AS INCREASING STATE PRESCHOOL RIGHT- THE MAJOR. ONE TIME INVESTMENTS ARE FOCUSED ON. INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH IN TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL. FOR GREETING SCHOOL BUS FLEETS AND ADDRESSING- KIND OF GENERAL TRANSPORTATION NEEDS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE- AS WELL AS IMPROVING OUR PROVIDING MORE. CASH INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE LAST BUDGET BUT WITH- PROPOSAL OF. FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- IN THIS BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR BUDGET DOES PROPOSE. A READ OF THE TEST ONE PUBLISHED NINETY EIGHT PER. TO FOR THAT INCREASE COSTS OF ADDITIONAL STUDENT SERVED INTERNET TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE A PUBLIC FOR THE MEDICATION FINISHING IN TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND THAT'S CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS NO IT WILL BE REVISED THE ACTUAL TO BECOME AVAILABLE SIMILAR TO THE REST ABOUT THE ABOUT- ONE NOT CONSTANTLY REQUIRED- THIS PROPOSAL TO BE BENCH. IS CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICETO ADJUST THE PROBLEMS NINETY CALCULATION TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MOVEMENT AND FUNDING OF PROGRAMS WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE CURRENCY RELATIVE TO NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SEVEN. LEVELS WITHOUT I'LL I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF AND I KNOW THAT LEO HAS MUCH ASSURE AS WELL BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LATER ON. IN THE HEARING HAPPY TO ADDRESS UP. OKAY THANK YOU LET'S NOT HERE FOR MISTER COUPONS ALEJO. YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAN GET ON WITH THE ANALYST OFFICE OUR COMMENTS ARE SUMMARIZED IN THIS RIGHT NOW SINCE WE PUBLISHED IN HARD COPY AND ON OUR WEBSITE SO I'LL JUST PROVIDE A FEW HIGHER LEVEL COMMENTS- RELATE. ARE REITERATING SOMETHING DEPARTMENT OF. FINANCE SAID THE STORY THIS YEAR ABOUT CHANGES IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IT'S REALLY ABOUT- THE IF YOU HAVE ANY ESTIMATES OF THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AND- ESTIMATE. IT'S DRIVEN BY MANY FACTORS SURGING RETAIL SALES RECORD HIGH CORPORATE EARNINGS. GROWTH EMPLOYER PAYROLLS AND THOSE ARE THE MAIN. ECONOMIC DRIVER IS PUSHING UP REVENUE AND THE ESTIMATES OF THE GUARANTEED- THAT TURNING TO OUR PAGE THREE OF OUR- ANALYSIS- THAT I REVENUES AND HIGHER GUARANTEED WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASES IN. DEPOSITS IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE. THOSE ARE ALSO GOING TO TRIGGER THE CAP ON SCHOOL DISTRICT RESERVES TO MEDIUM AND LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT THAT DOES DISTRICTS CAN HOLD FOR GENERAL PURPOSES TO ABOUT 10% OF THEIR BUDGETS. WE THINK THAT AT LEAST TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE DISTRICTS WOULD BE EFFECTED IT UP BY THAT OF THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THE OPTION OF SPENDING DOWN THOSE WITH SERVICE DESIGNATE AND DESIGNATING THEM CONSPECIFIC PURPOSES OR SEEKING AN EXEMPTION FROM THEIR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. TRYING TO PITCH FOR WE THINK THE REVENUE ESTIMATES UNDERLYING TO GUARANTEE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR GENERALLY REASONABLE. OFFER TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- THE ESTIMATES THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FOR GENERAL FUND REVENUE ARE ABOUT OUR LITTLE OVER NINE BILLION BELOW ARE NOVEMBER ESTIMATES. THOUGH THAT'S ESTIMATES THE BUDGET FOR THAT YEAR STEPHEN PLAUSIBLE- MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER I DECENT CHANCE WITH THE HIGHER ESTIMATES- BY MAY. I FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT ARE NEARLY TEN MILLION BELOW ARE NOVEMBER NOVEMBER OUTLOOK ESTIMATES BUT MOST OF THAT DIFFERENCE IS DUE TO SOME OF THE TAX PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. IF WE WERE TO ADJUST THOSE AND SCORE THOSE- IN OUR NOVEMBER OUTLOOK WE DON'T UP WITH A VERY SIMILAR REVENUE ESTIMATE. TO THE ONE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. I TO THE X. THAT RAP CHANGE. ARE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE NEARLY FORTY CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF HIGHER LOWER REVENUE. THAT'S DRIVEN BY A TEST TEST ONE FORMULA IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION THAT GUARANTEES SCHOOLS AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES RECEIVE ABOUT 40% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE. UP ANOTHER KEY POINT HERE IS THAT WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AROUND ATTENDANCE STUDENT ATTENDANCE LEVELS BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AS WELL AS WHAT MIGHT LIE AHEAD IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT EVEN IF ATTENDANCE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN EITHER OR BOTH OF THOSE HERE IS. THAT WOULD NOT RESULT IN A DROP IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE YOU THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULAS. ARE STILL REQUIRED THE STATE TO PROVIDE THE SAME 40% OF TOTAL REVENUE THAT IT PROVIDES- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENT. BUDGET ESTIMATES. I SHIFTING TO PAGE FIVE AND SOME OF THE SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN BILLION IN NEW SPENDING. BY NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION OF THAT IS ONGOING AND MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION IS ONE TIME. WE THINK OF THOSE PROPOSALS AS REALLY FALLING INTO FOUR BUCKETS. THAT THERE'S FIVE POINT THREE BILLION RELATED THE PREVIOUS BUDGET COMMITMENTS THIS IS FUNDING EXPANSIONS ARE PROGRAM AUGMENTATIONS THAT WERE AGREED UPON IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. OF THE PROJECT HAS FOUR POINT ONE BILLION FOR COVERING COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE TENANTS CHANGES. THAT INCLUDES THAT CHANGE IN HOW THE STATE ADDRESSES DECLINING ATTENDANCE AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL COVER THAT IN YOUR- NEXT PANEL. BUDGET HAS TWO POINT BILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THAT IS RAMPS FOR SCHOOL BUSES THERE'S ALSO SOME MODIFICATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND FINALLY THE WE HAVE ABOUT SIX BILLION- IN OTHER PROPOSALS THAT DON'T FALL INTO ONE OF THOSE OTHER CATEGORIES. FIVE PAGE SIX IS JUST THE LIST OF THE MAJOR KICKOFF PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET ONE TIME AND I'M GOING. TO PROVIDE THE SAME LIST FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON PAGE SEVEN. YOUR AGENDA COVERS ALL THAT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND YOU'LL COVER THOSE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS EITHER LATER IN THIS HEARING. AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS ARE ONCE IN A LOT OF TIME ON THAT NOW. BY TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT. THE STATE HAS REACHED IMPORTANT. MILESTONE WHERE IT COULD LIKELY WHETHER A MILD RECESSION. I WITHOUT RESORTING TO REDUCTIONS IN K. FOURTEEN PROGRAMS ARE PAYMENT DEFERRALS. THAT BUDGET RESILIENCE REFLECTS THE NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE NEARLY 10% OF THE GUARANTEED. IT ALSO REFLECTS THE BUDGET NOT COMMITTING ALL OF THE ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO ONGOING PROGRAMS WHICH GIVES THE SALE OF A QUESTION. I COULD GUESS POTENTIAL DROPS IN THE GUARANTEE IN THE FUTURE. AND TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE KIND OF. SCENARIO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT. IF I PATHETICALLY STATE REVENUES WERE TO EXPERIENCE A YEAR OVER YEAR DROP ABOUT TWENTY BILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THEN REMAIN AT THAT LOWER LEVEL IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND THEN RECOVER AT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OF THE STATE COULD LIKELY FIND AT THE GUARANTEE AND GET THROUGH THOSE TWO DOWN YEARS. I WITHOUT RESORTING. TO REDUCTIONS IN PROGRAMS. WE THINK IT'S OF THE ON GOING. ARE REASONABLE ESPECIALLY FOR K. TWELVE A LOT OF THOSE PROPOSALS RELATE TO THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. OR FUNDING PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS. SOME OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPPOSE THOSE RAISE NEW ISSUES THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT. OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE COVERING THOSE AND SOME SUBSEQUENT HEARING THIS. UNLIKE PREVIOUS BUDGETS ARE THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT TO THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THIS YEAR- THE STATE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES IS TWO POINT SIX BILLION ABOVE ITS APPROPRIATION LIMIT ACROSS TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND AS YOU KNOW IN THE STATE IS ABOVE THELIMIT IT HAS THREE BASIC OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING THOSE EXCESS REVENUES. IT CAN USE THAT AMOUNT TO LOWER TAX REVENUES. IT CAN INCREASE SPENDING ON X. ON IT ON PURPOSES THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM THE LIMIT LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE OR STATE EMERGENCY IS. OREGON'S BOOK CAME PAYMENTS TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND TAX REBATES. AND WE BRING THIS UP BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS THE KINDS OF TRADE OFFS AND ADJUSTMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE THE BUDGET. FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE TAKES INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS AND JUST THAT WOULD NOT INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING SOME NON EXEMPT PURPOSE- THAT INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF THE STATE'S OVER THE LIMIT. AND REQUIRES MORE. OF THOSE OTHER TYPES OF CHOICES. TURNING TO PAGE NINE I BE UP TO OVER RECOMMENDATIONS TO GUIDE SOME OF THE UPCOMING BUDGET CONVERSATIONS. THE FIRST TO BE DEFINED IF YOU WERE NEW INITIATIVES THAN WHAT THE BUDGET PROPOSES. DISTRICTS FACE SOME SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS. THOSE INCLUDE STAFFING DISRUPTIONS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FUTURE INVOLVEMENT AND INTEREST IN DISTRICT PROGRAMS. THAT DISTRICTS ARE ALSO WORKING ON PLANS TO SPEND MORE THAN TWENTY BILLION IN ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS. AND IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD ADD EVEN MORE PROGRAMS TO THAT. MIX SO MUCH SO THAT WE THINK DISTRICTS WOULD STRUGGLE TO IMPLEMENT. ALL OF THOSE PROPOSALS EFFECTIVELY. SOME RELATED TO FACTORS WE'D RECOMMEND USING UPCOMING HEARINGS TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE THE PROPOSALS. THAT ADDRESSED MOST REALLY DEFINED PROBLEMS. AND THAT ENTAILS ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION BOTH TO EXPLAIN THE UNDERLYING ISSUE. AND TO EXPLAIN WHY ADDITIONAL. FUNDING IS THE BEST BECAUSE THAT'S THE ISSUE. AND WHETHER IT WOULD FRAGMENTS- OR DISRUPT EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT STATE IS ALREADY. FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE WORK FIRST PROPOSALS WE SUGGEST. NOT CREATING ANY NEW PROGRAMS IN THAT AREA UNTIL YOU HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CONCERNS WITH THE EXISTING PROGRAMS. CONCLUDES OUR LITTLE COME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY BY. OKAY THANK YOU WERE GOING TO HOLD OFF UNTIL WE HEAR ALL THREE PANELISTS NEXT WE HAVE A VERY NICELY WHO IS STEPPING IN TODAY IN HER NEW POSITION. AS CHIEF. SOMETHING OR OTHER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. MARY GRADUATION WELCOME. A GOOD MORNING A TEAR MCCARTY RHODE ISLAND COMMITTEE THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE- I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION THURMAN I AM THE CHIEF CHIEF DEPUTY OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS THE S. P. I. SHARED IN HIS OVERVIEW WE ARE THANKFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS KEEPING EDUCATION AS A KEY PRIORITY IN THE BUDGET DEAL F. IN THE L. A. O. OF ALREADY COVERED PROP NINETY EIGHT THOROUGHLY SO WE'LL JUST NOTE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE ESTIMATED GUARANTEE RAINY DAY FUND OR REINVENTION PROPOSALS. REGARDING FEDERAL FUNDING ELEAZAR RECEIVED MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF STIMULUS FUNDING STARTING WITH THE CARES ACTED MARCH TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY CHRIS SAID IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY AND HARPER IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE BULK OF THE FUNDING HAS GONE OUT UNDER THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND OR S. OR FUND. FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS 90% OF THE FUNDING FROM EACH ROUND OF ESR IS REQUIRED TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE L. A.'S BASED ON THEIR SHARE OF TITLE ONE. THE REMAINING 10% OF EACH ROUND OF ESSAR HAS GENERALLY BEEN BUNDLED WITH OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS MAINLY THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY EDUCATION RELIEF HERE FUNDS AND CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUNDS THIS YEAR EFFORTS. AS WELL AS STATE GENERAL FUND INTO VARIOUS RELIEF PACKAGES. THESE PACKAGES INCLUDE THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION FUND FROM TWENTY TWENTY AND AB EIGHTY SIX FROM EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TOTAL FUNDING ACROSS ALL SOURCES IS JUST OVER THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THE LATEST REPORTING COVERS TWENTY SIX POINT FIVE BILLION IN FUNDING FROM THE START OF THE PANDEMIC TO THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MORNING SHOWS AS THE ELLIE GAYS HAVE SPENT NINETY NINE POINT 8% OF THE NEARLY FIVE BILLION FUNDS. THAT EXPIRED LAST MAY AND JUNE. IN 91% OF THE NEARLY TWO BILLION THAT EXPIRES NEXT IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. JUST A FEW DAYS LESS THAN A YEAR FROM NOW. ELEAZAR EVEN SPENT 41% OR TWO POINT FIVE BILLION OF ESTHER TO FUNDING WHICH DOES NOT EXPIRE UNTIL JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. DATA SHOWS THAT THE LARGEST USE OF FUNDS ACROSS ALL FUNDS HAS BEEN PURCHASING TECHNOLOGY TOTALING TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. CD IS WORKING ON STANDING UP REPORTING FOR THE REMAINING FEDERAL FUNDS AND WILL HAVE THOSE ONLINE IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE ARE ALSO STANDING UP THE ANNUAL REPORTING FOR ALL FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS OTHER FEDERALLY REQUIRED REPORTS I HAVE WITH ME JUST OF SIGNS AND DENVER WENT. FROM THE TEAM THAT OVERSEES FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDING TO ASSIST IN ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. SO DO WE WANT TO HAVE YOUR THE OTHER PERSON SPEAKER JUST TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR US. OKAY SORRY THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OKAY ALL OF A FEW BUT ALL BUT OTHER KEEP COMMITTEE MEMBERS GO FIRST TODAY LIKE. OKAY THIS VIRUS PRETTY. M. SO THE ONLY- INDICATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 76% OF THE MEDIUM AND LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE CURRENTLY HAVE RESERVES EXCEEDING THE 10% CAP THAT WULD BE TRIGGERED ON THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR SCHOOL YEAR BASED ON THE PROJECTED RESERVES OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT FOR TODAY ONLY SO WOULD IT BE HELPFUL TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THAT RESERVE CAP PROVIDING ADJUSTMENT FOR ADJUSTMENT PERIOD FOR MANY ALLEY A STRUGGLING ON HOW TO TRANSITION FROM ONE TIME STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS. I THINK YOU SO WE'VE ASKED DISTRICTS AND OF THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THEY PLAN TO ADDRESS- THERE IS THERE CALIFORNIA STANDING IS THAT MANY OF THEM. MANY OF THEM INTEND TO GOVERNING BOARD ACTION TO SET THOSE RESERVE THE SITE FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. I THINK- I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR THEM BECAUSE- THE STATE HAS IN. THE PAST COUPLE YEARS I THINK TRIED TO ENCOURAGE LARGER RESERVES AT 10% RESERVE FOR JUST GENERAL PURPOSES ISN'T ALL THAT MUCH TO GET THROUGH- SOME KIND OF ECONOMICS. COMING DOWN TURN. US WITHOUT A VERY LARGE QUESTION GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY THAT. DISTRICTS MIGHT FACE- STORE EXPECTATIONS ISN'T TAT DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO SPEND DOWN QUITE A BIT OF THE RESERVES BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT ADDS A LITTLE BIT. MORE COMPLEXITY- A LOT MORE PRESSURE ON THEM KIND OF AS PART OF. THIS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS SO- OF POTENTIALLY COULD BE HELPFUL FOR THEM ALTHOUGH THEY'RE FACING. THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY AND HAVE UNIQUE- BUDGET CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING NEXT YEAR. SO CAN YOU TELL US HOW PROPOSITION TO DIRECT THE STATE TO SPEND OR SAVE. FUTURE FORMULA DRIVEN DEPOSIT AMOUNTS THAT EXCEED THE 10% YES SO ONCE THE PROPOSITION TO RESERVE THE STATE RESERVE WE JUST 10% OF THE GUARANTEED ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS ON A LONGER REQUIRED. WHEN IT'S TIME TO TAKE THOSE DEPOSITS OUT OF THE RESERVE ALLOCATE THEM TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SOMETIMES THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE THRALLS THE LEGISLATURE CAN ALSO DO IT ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS. BUT THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC FORMULA IN THERE THAT EXPLAINS HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS. ONE OF B. AS THE HESITATION MAY BE CONCERNED THAT HER CONTEST FIX OF THAT IT'S HARD TO INCLUDE THE STATE RESERVE AND I LOCAL PLANNING BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE STATE'S GOING TO USE THAT ONE WE ACTUALLY DO GET INTO A DOWNTURN THAT COULD BE WE ALLOCATED BASED ON A PER PUPIL BASIS HAS. TO BE THE STATE DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK DISTRICTS WE APPRECIATE THAT THE STATE HAS A RESERVE FOR SCHOOLS BUT IT'S HARD TO- COALESCED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE YOU THE. NEXT TIME THE STATE ENTERS A DOWNTURN. OKAY SO THE STATE CAN SEE. THIS CAN SAVE OR- THE FUNDS. ARE THE RESERVE IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE FUNDS HAVE TO BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE USE OF THE STATE COULDN'T USE THAT TO. LEAVE IT FOR SOME OTHER NON SCHOOL NOT EDUCATION PROGRAM ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET- IT'S DIFFERENT THAN SAY THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE OTHER RESERVES TO MEET CREATED FOR JOURNALISTIC. I THOUGHT WELP WITH THE SUPPLEMENTS WILL THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IN SOME FORM. THAT WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE LEGISLATURE THE TAXI CABINS ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DONALD. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND APPRECIATE ALL YOUR OF MANY- WITHOUT A JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE- EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES OPPORTUNITIES GRANT AND THE GOVERNOR C. N. AS BUDGET IDENTIFIES IT IS EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM AS ELABORATE I ASSUME THOSE ARE THE SAME THING OKAY WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT PROGRAM. FOR THE GOVERNOR THIS YEAR WAS TO INCREASE THE ONGOING FUNDING BY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS. EVEN MORE THAN THE CALL HE APPLIES TO THE BASE ALLOCATIONS OF THIS IS A HUGE PROGRAM THIS IS REALLY BECOMING A BIG PROGRAM CAN YOU. CAN SOMEONE IDENTIFY WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM WHAT IS THIS. THE FINANCER WHOEVER. SURE HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH A AND AREA AGAIN FOR ME TO FIND OUT- I COULDN'T TAKE FIRST OUT THAT THE DANCER THERE FOR YOU AND IF SOME KAMALA LIKE START WITH LIKE NOT BEEN ON THAT THAT'S FINE WITH ME- SO TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF BACKGROUND SO THAT PROGRAM WAS ENACTED AT THAT THE MOST RECENT BUDGET- WITH A ONE BILLION DOLLAR IN ONGOING PROPAGATE INVESTMENT AND ALSO ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. AND A ONE TIME PROBABLY NINETY THAT REVIEWS AND- THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE FOR- LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL DAY OUTSIDE OF WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE- INSTRUCTIONAL TIME FOR EXAMPLE THAT COUNTS TOWARD. A COMPUTING AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE REALLY OTHER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS WHETHER THEY BE BEFORE SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL- DURING SUMMER SCHOOL TIME- SO THAT'S ALL LAID OUT IN STATUTE WHEN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDED BY THAT IN CONCERT WITH. OTHER NON FEEL COMMUNITY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OR WHETHER THAT- IT'S STAFF AND- FOLKS AT THE EARLY AGE ARE ARE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THEMSELVES TO OFFER THOSE PROGRAMS SO THEIR STUDENTS GRADE- THAT THE NATIONAL YOU COVERED IT IT YOU COVERED THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO JUST JUST SOME FOLLOW UP TO THAT. HOW IS THAT. THAT'S OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL DAY. SO HOW IS IN A FEW. USE OF NINETY EIGHT MONEY. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE CREE A MEGA PROGRAM THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ON GOING RIGHT. I'M SAYING THAT THAT THAT'S HIGHER THAN THE COLA. THAT'S A BLIGHTED BASE WHICH IS CRAZY TO ME RIGHT. WE'RE DRIVING MONEY AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM NOW. SO IS THIS. I MEAN IT HAS THERE BEEN SOME LEGAL TEST OF THE TERM THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF NINETY EIGHT MONEY TO USE IT OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL DAY. I MEAN PROP FORTY NINE YEARS AGO GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WE'VE ADDED TO THAT. BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WELL. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE GOOD THING BUT THAT THIS. THIS IS SOMETHING WELL IN ADDITION TO THAT. WHAT IT I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF FUNDING AND- WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT PASSED THAT TEST BUT PAUL YOU KNOW OUTSIDE ABOUT THE ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE OUTSIDE OF THE- MAIN INSTRUCTIONAL DAY I WOULD NOTE. AS WELL THAT- WITHIN ACT OF THIS PROGRAM IN IN- IN JAIL. IT WAS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT ENACTMENT THAT FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM WOULD REACH A FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- AND A RATE FOR FOLKS OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER STUDENT THAT SIR PER ADA- IN THAT PROGRAM AND THAT THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM THAT WAS THE GREEN ALL ALONG BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO- INCREASE FUNDING OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. TO THAT POINT SO THAT WE EVEN REALLY HAVE SUPPORT IN THE FUNDING THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD IT OUT AS- IT WAS ENVISIONED BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE- SO IT'S PART OF THAT AGREEMENT AND THEN. OUR PROPOSAL THIS YEAR- GIVEN THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO FULLY COME OUT GIVE A CALL- ANTICLINE IN ROMAN PROPOSAL. WE FELT IT APPROPRIATE TO BUILD OUT THIS PROGRAM- PERHAPS A BIT FASTER MAYBE FINISH THE ENVISIONED BUT DEFINITELY STILL IN LINE WITH WHAT WE UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE AGREEMENT- MOVING FORWARD ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. GREAT THANK YOU AND I AGAIN I JUST QUESTION WE DON'T NEED TO GOING TO NOW BUT I JUST QUESTION WHETHER THAT WOULD PASS LEGAL TASK. BECAUSE IT'S MONEY THAT I WOULD ARGUE IS BEING DRIVEN AWAY. FROM THE CLASSROOM FOR DAYTIME INSTRUCTION. AND OTHER THOSE ARE GOOD PROGRAMS BUT ARGUABLY. THEY COULD BE FINED WITH GENERAL FUND MONEY AS WELL- AND YOU LOOK AT THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT. A 5% PLUS INCREASE. TO THE BASE ALLOCATION ON TOP OF A GOVERNOR'S ALREADY PROPOSED FIVE POINT THREE THREE. WE COULD REALLY HAD TOWARDS. MEETING THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- OF STUDENT- PEOPLE FUN. SO I ADDED TO AGAIN A QUESTION- WITH REGARD TO PERSON STIRS THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL. EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS THAT ACCURATE ON THE ON THE EMPLOYER SIDE. THAT IS CORRECT. IT IS ONE OF NOTE FOR MEMBERS LIKE ME THAT PUTS A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT MEANS THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH MORE MONEY. TO PAY THE PENSION BURDEN ON TOP OF WHAT THEY ARE ALREADY. UP HANG- WITH THAT- IT WITH GUARD TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT- SO CAN WALK ME THROUGH THAT SO. BURIED IN THAT PROPOSITION WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT ACTUALLY. REQUIRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN DURING SOME YEARS TO HAVE A CAP OF TEN PERCENT. OF RESERVES THAT ACCURATE. SIR THAT THAT'S ACCURATE THOUGH THE STATUTE STATES THAT WHEN THE RESERVE BALANCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR IS ABOUT 3% OF THE K. TWELVE SHARE OF THE GUARANTEED THAT IN THE YEAR SUBSEQUENT TO THAT BALANCE MEETING THAT THRESHOLD- THE RESERVE CAPS THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE ARE IN FACT. OKAY I VOTED FOR THAT THING I WOULD I DO THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT PART OF- OF THAT PROPOSITION PROPOSITION TWO IS TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT EITHER WAY IT WAS SO COULD THE LEGISLATURE- THROUGH STATUTE ALTER THAT OR WE WOULD REQUIRE GOING BACK TO THE PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW SO AS FAR AS THE AS FAR AS THE DISTRICT RESERVE CAPS ARE CONCERNED- THAT ALREADY HAS BEEN AMENDED THE STATUTE ONE BUT BELIEVE IT WAS. SB SEVEN FIFTY ONE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN RAM THAT DID AMEND THAT THOSE ARE THE REQUIREMENTS BESIDES OF THE RESEARCH THAT WAS ALLOWABLE- IT EXCLUDED- I BELIEVE BATES GAVE DISTRICT AND SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT THE MOST ABOUT OF PROVISIONS AROUND- JUST RESERVE CAPS ARE IN STATUTES. OUR INSPECTION OKAY THANK YOU- A PRE THE RE BENCHING. TO- TO- TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED EXPENDITURES TEEKAY WHICH MR MCCARTY HAS SO. THIS PUSH FOREIGN FINALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING US TO SOME CONGRATULATIONS MR KULKARNI UNDER WORK THERE AND AGAIN THE RE BENCHING IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T ADD STUDENTS TO THE BUCKET BUCKET BUT ACTUALLY MAKES THE BUCKET BIGGER. THE BUCKET OF DOLLARS BIGGER- AND THEN ANOTHER THING JUST- FOR THE L. A. O. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT- THE ONLY- COMMENT. WHETHER TO FUND FEWER OF ONE TIME PROPOSALS- BECAUSE AGAIN THE MORE PROGRAMS WE THROW SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW- THE LESS THEY CAN DO QUITE FRANKLY ARE THERE GOING TO BENEW PROGRAMS I'M SURE THEY WILL. DO SOME NAY BE NEED TO BE FORTIFIED. OF COURSE BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO BE VERY PRUDENT- NOT TO OVER BURDEN. OUR SCHOOLS WITH MANDATES AND NEW PROGRAMS. AND THEN JUST GOING BACK TO THE COMPLEX THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS THE U. A. O. APPARENTLY. THE WAY THAT STATUTE IS WRITTEN OR IMPLEMENTED IT. IT BENEFITS THE THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE- CASTERS THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. IT APPEARS YOU- AS AS WE HEAD DOWN THE TIMELINE- IT BENEFITS THE STATE MORE THAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OTHER WORDS STATES TO HAVE HAVE A LESSEN BURDEN. WITH REGARD TO THE PENSION THE CARD THE PENSION COSTS OF THE BIRD OF PENSIONS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACTUALLY. HAVE AN INCREASED BURDEN IS THAT ACCURATE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL I CAN TAKE AND I SHOT IT ANSWERING THAT- THE- STATE- AS YOU KNOW WHEN IT CREATED THE CHARACTERS FUNDING PLAN. ASSIGN SOME OF THE LIABILITY TO SCHOOLS EMPLOYERS AND SOME TO THE STATE. AND WHAT MAKES THE ASSIGNMENT IN CALCULATION OF LIABILITY SO COMPLICATED AS IT'S NOT BASED ON THE ACTUAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE PLAN AS IT EXISTS TODAY BUT WHAT. THE PLAN WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE IF THE STATE HAD MADE DIFFERENT DECISIONS IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ABOUT BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS- ONE OF THE- I THINK PERHAPS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT APPROACH IS THAT. NEARLY ALL OF THE VOLATILITY AND INVESTMENT RETURNS IS ASSIGNED TO THE STATE AND SO WHEN INVESTMENTS DO REALLY REALLY WELL LIKE THEY GET OVER THIS PAST YEAR- THE STATE RECEIVED NEARLY ALL OF THE BENEFIT FROM THAT- WHEN THEY DO VERY POORLY THE STATE'S ON THE HOOK- FOR MOST OF THE INCREASED COSTS. AND SO THERE IS NOT- AND ABOUT A SHARING OF- OF THE GAMES AND- ASSURING OF THE UPS AND DOWNS IN THE SYSTEMS INVESTMENT AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS THE WAY THAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT- THE WAY THE- CITY CALPERS IS STRUCTURED FOR IT THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY THE CASTERS LIABILITY IS. IS SET UP. HOW WE THINK A MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD TO SPLIT UP THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY WOULD MAKE THE PLAN EASIER TO MONITOR IN YOUR TO UNDERSTAND. AND WHAT A LIMIT SOME OF THESE ON IT UNINTUITIVE AND MAY BE UNINTENDED OUTCOMES WHERE THERE IS A- FOR APPLE A BIG REALLY BIG GAME INVESTMENT RETURNS. AND THAT DOESN'T REALLY RESULT IN SCHOOL. CONTRIBUTION RATES GOING DOWN AT ALL. SO BY. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHEN THE- WHEN THE FUND IS HOW. TO S. AND THE BURDEN ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS. RIGHT WHEN THE FUND DOES VERY WELL IN THAT THE INVESTMENT RETURNS THE COASTERS THIS PAST YEAR BUT WAS UNPRECEDENTED AND IT WASN'T REALLY ONLY SEVEN POINT TWO. EXACT RIGHT IT WAS RIGHT SOMETHING THAT NONE OF THE SORT OF CENTER TO THE FAIRLY CONSUMMATED THIS SYSTEM EVER ACHIEVING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE WOULD EXPECT AND WHAT CAN WITH CALPERS THAT RETURN ALLOWED THE STATE TO REDUCE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON SCHOOL EMPLOYER RATES NEXT COUPLE YARS- WITH CAL STAR IS IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE IN FACT. IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT DISTRICT RATES WILL END UP BEING A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THEN THE SYSTEM WAS PROJECTING PREVIOUSLY. SO IF WE COULD MAYBE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE AND MYSELF- THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A RAMP. AND THE BURDEN ON A DISTRICT INCREASES EVERY COUPLE YEARS OR SO THE FINANCIAL BURDEN WITH REGARD TO. TO CAL STIRS. AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FUND HAS DONE EXTREMELY WELL PARTICULARLY LAST YEAR- THAT RAMP DOESN'T EVER NOTHING READ AND NEVER THERE'S NEVER. IT DOESN'T GO NEVER GOES DOWN RIGHT NO YOU'RE YOU'RE CAUGHT THE COST PER NEW DISTRICT ALWAYS GOES UP. AT THE RATE CAN GO DOWN- FOR EXAMPLE CAN GO DOWN AS- PAYROLL GROWS FASTER THAN THE STATE ASSUMES BECAUSE- IT MEANS THAT. THOSE CONTRIBUTION RATES GENERATE MORE MONEY FOR THE SYSTEM BUT IT DOESN'T GO DOWN BASED ON B. JUST HAVING A VERY STRONG INVESTMENT HERE WHICH IS THE HONEST WITH OF. PART OF THIS UNIQUE OKAY I GET IT THE RATE OF RETURN DOESN'T NECESSARILY IMPACT THE BURDEN TO A DISTRICT. RIGHT OR CANADA OR IT CAN IMPACT IT IN KIND OF THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE EXPECTED TO DO. OKAY UNDERSTOOD- WITH THAT THANK YOU. OKAY MEMBERS. OKAY I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON TO THE ISSUES THAT MISTER O'DONNELL- TOUCHED ON IN THERE IN THE AGENDA AS WELL- THE FIRST IS AS FAR AS- THE BASING CREASES TO THE LCF FORMULAR FORMULA- BEYOND THE COLA- AND- RISING PENSION COSTS AND HEALTHCARE COSTS INFLATION DO WE FEEL THOSE ARE IN MY OWN WORDS ROUGHLY ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS WHAT IS NEEDED I KNOW THE CALL WAY IS- SIGNIFICAN AND BEN LARGER THAN HISTORICAL US BUT DO WE FEEL THAT THAT IS ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL THE INCREASES IN THE FIXED COSTS. AREA PUBLIC FINANCE AGAIN I'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO FOR THE MINISTRATIONS PERSPECTIVE WEEK WE CERTAINLY- RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE ARE FACING- I THINK EVEN WITHOUT THE PANDEMIC THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY DO FACE- YOU KNOW RIGHT THINK THAT CALL THEM- ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SERVING OUR- OUR CHILDREN OUR STUDENTS IN THE STATE. I'M CERTAIN WITH PANDEMIC OF THE BAND- EXACERBATED. MADE MORE DIFFICULT SEVERAL- I THINK I WOULD TO- BOTH THANK YOU LARGE KOLAR THAN HISTORIC BUT- ALSO. ARE PROPOSAL FOR DECLINING ENROLLMENT WHICH I WON'T REALLY TELL HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE ME TO COME I KNOW WE'RE COMING ON COMING IN ON THE NEXT PANEL BUT- THAT WAS REALLY DEVELOPED- REALLY A LOT. AS A RESULT A LOT OF- CONVERSATIONS WITH PARTNERS- LIKE MY CLIENT AND HIS HIS STAFF WITH THICK MAT. REALLY TRYING TO GET A REPORT ON WHAT DISTRICTS NEED. IN THIS TIME- FINANCIALLY YOU KNOW THE STATE THAT THEY'RE IN- OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN AND AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM I DON'T RECALL IT. MIGHT TAKE MATTER PRESENTED TODAY OR IN THE FUTURE HEARING BUT- YOU KNOW YOU'LL HEAR FROM HIM AS- OFTEN RECENT YEARS. IT SAID THAT- FOR THE MOST PART MANY DISTRICTS ARE ARE NOT ENOUGH A TOUGH PLACE- ON ON A CASH BASIS- SO MUCH OF MAYBE PERHAPS THERE SINCE MANAGEMENT IN IN A SMALL. OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ATTORNEY ONE OF THE BUS CARE. WITHOUT MIGHT MY INTENT WITH THAT COMMENT BUT- THAT FOR THE MOST PART- THE REVENUE IS THERE- IT'S JUST HELPING THEM IN IN THIS CASE THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT PROPOSAL- CHART A PATH BUT THE BIT MORE SMOOTH- WITHOUT. YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE YEAR TO YEAR- BOMB SWORD OR SIGNIFICANT DECREASES I SHOULD SAY. IN THINGS LIKE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE- AND REALLY HELPING THEM ADJUST TO THAT- AND ADJUST TO THE LONGER TERM- ENROLLMENT THE KIND THAT-IS. CONTINUING AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE EVEN WITH THE INFLUX OF PK EXPANSION- WE ARE EXPECTING A BIRTH RATE TO CONTINUE TO BE I'M REALLY START. LOW AND THAT'S GOING TO OF COURSE HAVE A NATURAL IMPACT ON THE P. TWELVE POPULATION THAT'S AVAILABLE TO BE SERVED- AND SO FOR US WE FEEL LIKE IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THOSE- CONSIDERATIONS AND PARTIES ARE. ARE OUT PROPOSAL DO YOU REALLY HELP PREPARE ELEAZAR IN THE BEST WAY. POSSIBLE ALSO ALSO PRIORITIZING FUNDS FOR A HOST OF OTHER PARTIES AND PROGRAMS- WITH THAT PROPOSITION NINETY AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU. OUR TO. TURN OUT MISTER O'DONNELL NOTED- THAT WAS CERTAINLY PART OF THE AGREEMENT LAST YEAR- MAKE SURE THAT WE- EXPAND EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDED UNIVERSAL THAT REALIZE THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A WHACK OUT OF EXISTING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUND FUNDING SO I THINK IT WAS A WIN WIN- WITH THIS RE BENCH SO JUST WANT TO HAVE A TECHNICAL QUESTION ON THE ON THE RE BENCH- SO WE'RE ADDING A NEW GREAT OF COURSE TO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM- WHAT TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY SO WE HAVE AS FAR AS- RICKY RESPONDING TO ACTUAL ADA. TWENTY K. OR HAVING IT BE A PREDICTABLE- AMOUNT SO WE CAN FOCUS ON THE EARLY IMPLEMENTATION. SURE SO- THE WAY THAT THE REVENGE WILL WORK. SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THE LTO BAPTISTS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SO THERE'S A BASE GRANT RATE RIGHT ALTHEA BAPHOMET AN LED WOULD RECEIVE A WHATEVER SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING ON TOP OF THAT THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO- AND ALL OF ME THE WAY THAT THE REBATE COULD BE CALCULATED AS ONCE WE HAVE ACTUALS- WE WOULD ADJUST AS NEEDED FOR WHATEVER THAT INCREASED CALL. IS ELEAZAR WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE EITHER WAY IN TERMS OF IMPACTING OUR FUNDING IF THEY'RE SERVING MORE KIDS AND HE K. IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA GET FUNDED ON THEIR ETA RIGHT AS THEY WOULDN'T IN IN ANY OTHER YEAR OR EVEN IF WE DIDN'T DO TO. EXPANSION THAT LIFTING EXPENSE WILL JUST KIND OF BE ROLLED IN WITH HOW WE TREAT- ON KIND OF AN ACCOUNTING RECONCILIATION BAKER THE REST OF THE ALTHEA SO ONCE PROP NINETY EIGHT IS- PRIOR YEAR FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND WE'RE WORKING ON THE- THE WHAT WOULD THEN BE THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX BUDGET. ARGUES ME THE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BUDGET TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WILL BE A NUMBER ARE YOUR THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO CERTIFY PERCENT STATUTE AND IT'S AT THAT POINT THAT WOULD MAKE THE FINALS SAY BASED ON ACTUAL DATA THAT WE WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE BY THAT POINT. TO SAY WHAT WAS THE TRUE COST- ASSOCIATED WITH WITH FIFTY K. EXPANSION IN OUR FIRST YEAR AND THEN WE WOULD BE BUNCHED THAT GUARANTEE- BY THAT AMOUNT AND THAT PERCENTAGE INCREASE WHAT WOULD CARRY OUT MOVING FORWARD- BUT AGAIN IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION FOR ELLIE AS PREDICTABILITY THERE- BETTER. WE HAVE AN IMPACT FOR THEM BECAUSE IT'S REALLY JUST MORE OF US- HOW DO YOU THINK ON THE AGGREGATE AT THE STATE WHAT WERE YOU KNOW THAT THE NEW COSTS WORKS BOTH IN THE STATE TO OR THE NEW COSTS THAT THAT THE GUARANTEE IS INCREASING BY. ABOUT IT SHOULD HAVE BUT LIKE I SAID I READ READY GOT IT SHOULD HAVE PRACTICAL IMPACT RALLY I THINK THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD KNOWING THAT THAT THAT EIGHTY EIGHT- IS FUNDED- WITHIN THE GUARANTEED AMOUNT YOU OUT. THANK YOU CAN I ASK YOU. THE LAST MISTER COUPON WITH THE L. A. FOR YOUR THOUGHTS THERE WERE. A PROPER EIGHT. REGARD TO K. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO THAT. JUSTIN BRING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THE MOST- THE ESTIMATED IN IN EIGHT FIVE THE ARBOR. LCSO RATE FOR A- TICKET TO STUDENTS. THAT'S LIKE A BASICALLY MY- TO US WE DO HAVE A LOT IT IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW ABOUT. HOW MANY STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS- G. K. IN CANADA THAT WAS THE GRADE LEVEL THAT'S BEEN MOST HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. WHEN AND BY HOW MUCH THAT'S GOING TO REBOUND IN COMING YEARS. AND WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A METHODOLOGY THAT'S FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR- THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF. ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WHO ARE ATTENDING DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF THE EXPANSION. I ONE ISSUE STILL NOT THAT BUT I THINK WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ONE IS HOW THE STATE'S GOING TO COLLECT INFORMATION FROM DISTRICTS ABOUT. HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL TICKET TENANTS THERE GENERATING RIGHT NOW THE STATE DOES NOT. COLLECT- ATTENDANCE INFORMATION THAT'S SPECIFIC TO THE T. K. GRADE LEVEL WE JUST COLLECTED IN A BROADER CATEGORY OF- U. K. THROUGH THIRD GRADE- SO WE'D SUGGEST ARE- IT MONITORING THAT ISSUE IT MAY BE ASKING. EDUCATION PRINT UPDATES ABOUT THEIR PLANS FOR COLLECTING THAT INFORMATION IS THAT THE STATE HAS WHAT IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THAT ADJUSTMENT CORRECTLY. OKAY THANK YOU- FURTHER QUESTIONS RELATED THIS PANEL. SEEING NONE WE'LL GO TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. WHEN THE- JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSALS. FISKERTON DOUBLE YEAH THE- GOTCHA THIS I'M SORRY THESE ARE NOT THE BUDGET YEARS THIS IS THIS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL YES THANK YOU SEE NUMBER TWO D. O. F. L. A. L. AND CD AGAIN. AGAIN OUR MEMBERS AN IDEA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO ALL GO OUT JUST FOR A BRIEF VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE MAJOR HEALTH SPENDING PROPOSAL THOUGHT SEVERAL OF THEM I DID MENTION IN MY- EARLIER PRESENTATION OF THEY'LL GIVE UP LIKE I MENTIONED DOES RECEIVE A PROPOSED FIVE POINT 33% BILLION DOLLAR CALL ADJUSTMENT THIS YEAR SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS WILL BE RECEIVING MORE THAN SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS NOW- THE OF THE ALTHEA. THE NOT CONCLUDING ARE DECLINING ENROLLMENT PROPOSAL- THE ESTIMATED- REGIONAL FUNDS WE MAKE FROM THAT- AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE NUTRITION DOG ALSO PROPOSED A PERMANENT CHANGE TO HOW. WHAT WE CALL FUNDED EIGHTY EIGHT WILL BE CALCULATED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE GENERATING LTFS AND GIVEN YEAR. TO CIVICALLY SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF BEING ON THE TOP OF THE CURRENT YEAR. OUR PRIOR YEAR FOR THE AVERAGE OF THE THREE MOST RECENT PRIOR YEARS WHICHEVER OF THOSE THREE VARIABLES IS GREATER. AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER COMMENT THIS IS REALLY IN RECOGNITION OF THE STEEP DECLINE IN THE ROLE THAT. DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN FACING AFTER SEVERAL YEARS EVEN PART OF THE PANDEMIC- AND- WE BELIEVE WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING INSULATE DOWN PROBLEM- SO MANY. OF THE LRGE YEAR TO YEAR A SWING HERE TO YOUR DECLINE. THAT MANY L. EIGHT MANY DISTRICTS ARE ARE ANTICIPATING SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ANY MINUTE IN FUTURE YEARS- IF NO ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN AND JUST THE GREATER CURRENT OR PRIOR YEAR AS AN EXISTING LAW. WORK TO REMAIN- THE MINISTRY. ALSO PROPOSES CHANGES TO ANNA AND STUDY TO HELP. THIS CLARA. AND FLEXIBILITY BURKE. THE COMPUTATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL TIME THAT COUNTS TOWARDS TENANTS- AND ALSO- CHANGES REGARDING. THE ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS INTO INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS OF PROVIDING SOME. BILLION CLARITY THERE MOVING FORWARD. IN ADDITION TO THE COST INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION THAT WE CAN DISCUSS WEBER RETENTION FOR THE ESTIMATED SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO DOES PROPOSE TO A SEPARATE- THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE BILLION FOR TRANSITION NO KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. TO HELP- ELEAZAR REDUCE THOSE ADULT STUDENT RATIO COUNTER ONCE TWELVE OPPORTUNITY STATUTE- AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON A UNIVERSITY K. EXPANSION. THE VERY LAST I DID WANT TO MAKE A- VERY BRIEFLY I WANT TO MAKE A TECHNICAL NOTE- WE WERE IT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THERE WAS A SLIGHT ERROR IN OUR BASELINE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT THAT WE USE TO CALCULATE THE L. GIVE UP CALL- AND WHERE THOSE ARE COMING FROM- NOT. TOTALED ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THE THREE YEARS AND I PLAYED ONE YEAR THAT WERE INADVERTENTLY NOT REFLECTED CORRECTLY AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WON'T RESULT IN ANY PRACTICAL IMPACT THE L. E. A. ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT AND IT DOESN'T HE ALSO DIDN'T IMPACT THE OVERALL CALCULATION OF THE PROPAGATE GUARANTEE- SO WE WERE ADVISED THAT AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION BUT I DID JUST WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT THAT HERE- IN IN TRANSPARENCY BUT- WITHOUT I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS ON ON THIS VERY BRIEF AND ALLOW THE L. O. CHAIR AND HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY I THINK YOU L. L. GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS MICHAEL PHELPS WITH THE L. A. O. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME. YES GREAT- WE PUBLISHED A POST ON A WEBSITE COVERING LVF COLA AS WELL THE PROPOSAL TENANTS ADJUSTMENT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FOR YOUR REFERENCE I'LL KEEP OUR COMMENTS HERE AT A HIGH LEVEL. BOB ALL WE UPDATED OUR ESTIMATE USING RELEASED FEDERAL DATA USED TO CALCULATE THE RATE WE ESTIMATE THAT THE CALL THE RATE WILL BE CLOSER TO SIX POINT 17% WHICH IS ALMOST 1% HIGHER THAN THE KOLIBRI ESTIMATED IN THE BUDGET- GOOD HIGHER COLO WITH ME WOULD INCREASE HEALTH IF OF COSTS BY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. AND THE COST FOR GET FULL CREDIBLE PROGRAMS WOULD INCREASE BY ABOUT FIFTY SIX MILLION- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE THE FINAL DATA USED TO CALCULATE THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE COLIN APRIL AND WILL APPEAR IN COURT IN THE- REGARDING THE FULL PROPOSALS. ADJUSTMENT WE'RE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SAFE FOR ME TO CHANGE. THE POOL OF STUFF IN THE IMPACT OF THE ROMAN DECLINES ON SCHOOL DISTRICT FUNDING ALLOCATIONS. WITHIN THE PROPOSAL WOULD ADDRESS BOTH A SHORT TERM DROPS IN FUNDING TO THE PANDEMIC AS WELL AS MORE LONG TERM. THE PROPOSAL COULD PROMOTE FISCAL STABILITY FOR DISTRICTS WEAPONS BEEN EXPERIENCING SUSTAINED WITH DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT. NOT AND ALLOW THEM MORE TIME TO AND IT JUST THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR THE REMAINING STUDENTS. ON SOME OF THE THINGS AT THEM MORE TIME FOR PLANNING ISRAEL SIX HALF. OF CONSOLIDATING PROGRAMS CLOSING SCHOOLS AND REORGANIZING ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. ADDITIONALLY AS THE DECLINE DISTRICTS WILL HAVE A SOFTER THE FUNDING. DISTRICTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GROWING WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HEALTH EFFECT INCREASES IN THEIR HOUSE WITH A FUNDING. FOR THE NEW STUDENTS. ON THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY SPECIFIC OFFICE OF CHANGES FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT INDICATES THAT MINISTRATION WILL. EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR THE SPRING DROUGHT THIS SPRING FOR EXTENDING A DECLINING ENROLLMENTS- SORRY TO CUT YOU TEND. TO SUGGEST THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. YOU THINK THE GOVERNOR'S CAN TO STUDY. ATTENDEES AT THE THAT'S JUST NOT FOR TERM READ. OF THE- DISK COULD AND THEN VERY OPTIONS LET'S JUST TO. HOWEVER FOR THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR UNLIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS FIFTH PROSPECT THAT IMMEDIATE FUNDING REDUCTIONS BASED ON ATTENDANCE DECLINES. DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING SOME TYPE OF TEMPORARY JUST MEANT TO OFFSET SOME FUNDING DECLINES IN THE CURRENT YEAR. ONE OPTION COULD BE TO ALLOW CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVE FUNDING BASED ON THE PREPEND EMIGRATE TENDONS FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THIS WILL PROVIDE THELEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION MORE TIME SIX AM AND LONGER TERM ALTERNATIVES. OF THIS CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE PROTECT. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M SORRY CITY. A VERY NICELY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION- AS THE S. P. I. SHARED IN HIS OVER HERE IN HIS OVERVIEW THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO CREATE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES FOR OUR STUDENTS FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS ARE DISTRICTS ARE FACED WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES DURING THESE VERY DIFFICULT TIMES WE HAVE GENERALLY HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT GROWING PENSION COSTS STAFFING ALSO REMAINS A HUGE CHALLENGE IN THE FIELD AND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS WHILE TRYING TO TRACK QUALIFIED STAFF. AND OF COURSE THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT ENROLLMENT AND EIGHTY IN LIGHT OF THEIR PREVALENCE UPON THE CRIME WE'RE THANKFUL FOR THE PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS OTHERS HAVE PUT FORWARD TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND THERE ARE OTHER INTERCONNECTED ISSUES TO ADDRESS TO SUCH AS THE SUPPLY OF STAFF. AS WE WORK THROUGH THESE PROPOSALS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO NOT PENALIZE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP CLASSROOMS WANTING WHILE KEEPING THEIR STUDENTS HEALTHY AND SAFE AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THAT LENDS THIS KEPT IN MIND AS WE DISCUSS HOW BEST TO HELP ELEAZAR GET THROUGH THE THIRTY YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC. WITH THIS IN MIND THE DEPARTMENT HAS ASKED THAT WAS ASKED TO PULL PRELIMINARY DATA COLLECTED IN THE STATE'S STUDENT LEVEL DATA SYSTEM CAL PADS OVERALL AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE K. TWELVE ENROLLMENT COUNTS ARE DOWN. ONE POINT 9% FROM LAST YEAR. AND TWENTY WE SAW THE LAW. GRAY LEVEL DECREASE IN KINDERGARTEN ELEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT. FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WHICH INCLUDED TWENTY TWO POINT KINDERGARTEN AND A NINE POINT FOUR DECREASE IN REGULAR KINDERGARTEN. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS A TOTAL INCREASE OF ONE POINT 7% IN KINDERGARTEN. AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT. FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. WHICH INCLUDES A NINE POINT 7% INCREASE IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND EIGHT POINT 3% INCREASE IN REGULAR KINDERGARTEN PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWED VARIABLE DECREASES IN GRADES ONE THROUGH ELEVEN FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WITH THE LARGEST INCREASE IN GRADES ONE THROUGH FIVE GRADES THROUGH THESE SEVEN THROUGH NINE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS SMALL INCREASES IN GRADE TWELVE AND GRADE SIX GRADE TEN AND GRADE LEVEL LEVEN. DECREASING SLIGHTLY BUT REMAINING RELATIVELY FLAT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE PRELIMINARY DATA ALSO SHOWS THAT THE DECREASE IN KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT OBSERVED IN TWENTY TWENTY HAS SHIFTED TO GRADE ONE WITH A DECREASE OF PORT FOUR POINT 3% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. BASED ON HISTORICAL MOMENT TRANS WE EXPECTED THAT THESE PRELIMINARY ENROLLMENT NUMBERS WITH INCREASED BY THE FINAL DATA. SUBMISSION DEADLINE FOR CAL PATS IN JANUARY TWENTY TWO. HOWEVER THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE OCCURRED FINALLY MOMENT NUMBERS BASED ON FIRST WEDNESDAY IN OCTOBER WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN EARLY SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I HAVE WITH ME ELIZABETH DEAR STEIN DIRECTOR FOR THE SCHOOLS FISCAL SERVICES DIVISION RANDY BANAL FROM OUR ANALYSIS MEASUREMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTING DIVISION TO ASSAULT ASSIST IN ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU I KNOW- THIS- EIGHTY A ISSUE IS JUST A MICROCOSM OF WHERE WE'RE AT WITH CALIFORNIA HAVING. DECLINING ENROLLMENT AS WELL AS GOING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WITH KOBE NINETEEN AS WELL SO THERE ARE LOTS OF IDEAS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THIS BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OF WHAT WE DO IS IN THE BEST. LONG TERM- PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIA KNOWING THAT WE WILL GET PAST THIS- THIS PANDEMIC IN THE IMPACT HERE AND WE WILL HAVE AS MR O'DONNELL NOTED- LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL SO WE'RE NOT DEBATING BILLS HERE HERE TODAY. BILLS THAT ARE NOT EVEN IN THIS HOUSE BUT I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT THIS OVERALL EIGHTY EIGHT ISSUE AND SO YOU KNOW WE HEARD ABOUT THIS LAST FALL WE HAD A HEARING. WE ASKED L. A. L. AND FINANCE TO COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS AND SO. THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CAME UP WITH THAT KIND OF A I'M I GUESS THE MIDDLE GROUND APPROACH. SO DETERMINE FIRST OF ALL DEPARTMENT FRIENDS CAN YOU GET MORE INTO DETAIL ON HOW YOU THINK THAT THIS. ADDRESS IS- THE ISSUES THAT THAT THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ARTICULATING AND GRANTED WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT HELPS THE MOST AMOUNT OF SCHOOL DISTRICT IS NOT JUST FOR ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE BIGGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO- WALK US THROUGH WHY WE THINK THIS IS. THE- THE MOST SOUND APPROACH. CERTAINLY AREA FORMA FINANCE AGAIN. SO I THINK I WOULD NOTE SEVERAL THINGS- IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT ABILITY- IT THE MOST SIMILAR TO OUR- CURRENT STRUCTURE BOTH IN THE SENSE OF. OUR WORK BUT IT STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO BURDEN ON ON ON THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT- THEY ALREADY REPORT THEIR CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR EIGHTY EIGHT AND THIS WILL JUST BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT DATA ABOUT PER- MULTIPLE PRIOR YEARS. WRITES ABOUT BUT ONE THING I THINK THE IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT-ABILITY AS- IN OUR FAVOR. ON THE OTHER. IS THAT IF WE WERE YOU KNOW WHAT. THE CONSIDERATION OF- MOVING TO OTHER KINDS OF FUNDING MODELS ASIDE FROM EIGHTY EIGHT- WOULD REQUIRE A LOTOF WORK AGAIN- REALLY SPEAK TO THE- DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION PIECE. ANNOUNCED WITH REGARD TO THINGS LIKE ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT AT THE EXISTING STRUCTURE WHEN IT COMES TO CALCULATING OUR ATTENDANCE INSTRUCTION TIME- WHAT WHAT THAT IS MADE UP BY- THERE'S A WHOLE YOU KNOW BACK IN ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL WITHIN THE AUDIT STRUCTURE- SO I WOULD. SPEAK TO THAT IN TERMS OF THIS NOT NEEDING REALLY TAKE ANY OVERHAUL IN THAT REGARD IT WOULD BE AGAIN. IMPLEMENTABLE IN THAT REGARD REALLY KEEPING THE FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL KIDS ARE ATTENDING THE ARE BEING SERVED- VERSUS PERHAPS JUST BEING ENROLLED. SO THAT'S ONE THING- THE OTHER I WOULD KNOW IS THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW THE TRENDS THAT WERE OBSERVING BUT I MENTIONED ACCEPTED EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND CERTAINLY IT DOES SEEM LIKE- WE HAD PERHAPS MORE FAMILIES WITH THE STATE OR MORE FAMILIES THE DIFFERENT AREAS. STATE MOVED WITHIN THE STATE THEN PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ABSENT THE PANDEMIC BUT OVERALL THE TRENDS ARE STILL THE SAME- THE K. TWELVE POPULATION TO KEEP ABOUT THE POPULATION. IS DECLINING AND IT BUT WITH BIRTH RATES BEING WHAT THEY ARE THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. EVEN WITH- TO TAKE SPANISH AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE ON A STATEWIDE BASIS- OVERALL THAT ENROLLMENT IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE. ON THE LONG TERM SO I DO THINK OUR PROPOSAL- RECOGNIZES THE DIFFICULTIES BUT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE REALITY THAT MANY LEDS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE WHEN IT COMES TO- RIGHT TIGHTENING THEIR PROGRAM OFFERINGS RIGHT FIGHTING THEIR- THEIR SCHOOLS AND- YOU DON'T PERSONALLY WE RECOGNIZE THESE ARE. THESE ARE DIFFICULT CONVERSATION I'M CERTAINLY- BUT CLOSING DOWN THE SCHOOL AND DECISIONS OF THAT NATURE- ARE. RARELY MET WITH YOU KNOW POSITIVE RECEPTIVITY BUT- IS CERTAINLY IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE THOSE ARE THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS. THAT NEED THAT IN SOME CASES ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE HOT WEATHER. THIS YEAR AREN'T YEARS- THAT'S JUST HOW OF THE PUMP. THAT THAT. OF THE BEAST SERVICE TO THAT X. AND START THE OUR PEOPLE REALLY. THAT RIGHT AS WELL SO IT'S ALLOW. US LANDING TO SPEAK HE GOT OUT. ON THE WHEN WE DO IT HAS A THESE ARE ALL DECLINE. TO GIVE L. MORE. TO AND LOOK AHEAD AND POINT. FOR WHAT THE MOTHER COME. WHAT SOME OF THOSE. IN CHOICES. NAY GONNA NEED TO BE. MAKING OUR- WE FEEL THAT OUR PROPOSAL KIND OF WALKS LINE- BY BYE PROVIDING THEM SUPPORT THEY NEED. AND IN A THEM TO THOSE THE DECISIONS SO I'LL BE BUYING. ANSWER THAT OKAY. JUST ONE FOLLOW UP. SO THE WE HAD OUR HEARING ON THIS AND FALL AND FROM THE FINANCES THERE AND THAT TIME LAST YEAR. THE THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES AND YOU KNOW IT LARGE EDUCATION ORGANIZATION. APPROACHED US THE LEGISLATURE AND YOU WITH A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND WHAT WAS YOUR- TAKE ON THAT AS FAR AS THE ADA VERSUS ACTUAL ATTENDANCE. RIGHT I THINK AT THIS POINT WE STAND BEHIND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE ARE SOME- I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS. NO I GET THAT BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE- THE- ENROLLMENT VERSUS ACTUAL ATTENDANCE THAT IDEA WAS APPROACH TO US IN THE FALL REGARDLESS OF THE BILL. SO DID WAS THAT EVALUATED AND WAS THAT CONSIDERED AS AN APPROACH AND YOU JUST THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS THE BETTER APPROACH. BUT CERTAINLY SORRY I THINK I MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION- SO YEAH WE DEFINITELY. CONSIDERED SEVERAL OPTIONS AND AGAIN I THINK ALL THE REASONS I LAID OUT A PREVIOUSLY ARE ARE WHY WE REALLY LANDED ON ON OUR PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE HELD TO BE THE BEST. OPERABLE THE MOVING FORWARD. OKAY FAIR ENOUGH AND WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO WEIGH INTO THIS- OKAY THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S IT FOR NOW- MISTER DONNA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST BOB- UNDER THREE HIGHLIGHT WHAT I SAID USING DIFFERENT WORDS- THE FIVE POINT MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS- GIVEN THE INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT THE NEED TO ADDRESS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. A READING COMPREHENSION LEARNING LOS SIX ADDRESS SO IT NEEDS TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. AND SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CLASS SIZE. I SUB OVER THE FALLS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND WHAT IT WHAT KIDS WERE ABSENT. RIGHT WHILE THE KIDS ONE WAY THAT I KNOW WHERE THEY WENT- BUT THE CLASS SIZES WERE MUCH SMALLER IN THIS WAS MIDDLE SCHOOL- IN YOU KNOW IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE THIRTY FIVE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS IN A CLASSROOM ESPECIALLY AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER PARTICULAR RIGHT. IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OF A ROCKY EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE CLASS SIZES OR ABOUT TWENTY TWO ISHE. AND I TELL YOU WHAT IT CHANGED THE TONE OF THE SCHOOL DAY. HAVING THAT MANY FEWER KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM YOU GET TO KNOW THEM. AND IT'S A MUCH MORE RELAXING ENVIRONMENT. THERE'S MANY QUALITATIVE. THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WORK IN THE IVORY TOWERS INTO THEIR STUDIES THAT HAVE NEVER TAUGHT SCHOOL WILL TELL YOU ALL WE DON'T THINK IT IMPACTS STUDENTS. ACHIEVEMENT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT ABSOLUTELY. IMPACTS STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND ALSO STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH BUT FRANKLY. BECAUSE GET BETTER CONNECTIONS WITH THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS AND THEIR TEACHERS. SO AGAIN THAT COLIN NEEDS TO BE MUCH HIGHER. AND WHEN PEOPLE SITE IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT AS A CALL REALLY AT THAT THAT'S TO ADDRESS DECLINING ENROLLMENT THAT'S NOT JUST A CALL- SO THAT THAT THAT'S- WHAT ONE POINT. AND I APPRECIATE THE SOMEONE BROACHED IT FURTHER PATCHING THIS YEAR'S. DECLINING ATTENDANCE- PROBABLY WITH WITH ONE TIME MONEY THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK INTO- ARE EXPERIENCING DECLINING ATTENDANCE- AND WITH REGARD TO IT WHETHER I KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT BILL BE SENT WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANY EFFORT TO HOLD HARMLESS THOSE ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS THEY SHOULD NOT BE HELD HARMLESS- AND THEN WITH REGARD INDEPENDENT STUDY- THE BRODRICK PROPOSES TO CLARIFY HOW SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION IS TRACED FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY AND EXTEND THE TIME FOR OBTAINING AGREEMENT SIGNATURES I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR ACTUALLY- WE NEED TO MOVE UP THAT TIMELINE TO GET THAT ADDRESSED. SO THAT SCHOOLS CAN GET THEIR MONEY- WITH THAT I WILL- DIRECTOR MISTER. THANK YOU. THE QUESTION SOMEONE MEMBER BY IT AS- THANK FOR SHARED JUST- ADDITIONAL JUST INFORMATION. AROUND THE ATTENDANCE CRISIS THE ATTENDANCE DATA REFLECTED IN THE AGENDA APPEARS TO SHOW AN IMPROVED RATE OF ATTENDANCE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR THOSE IN THE- QUOTE EXCELLENT AND SATISFACTORY CATEGORIES BUT A SHARP DECREASE. ACROSS MULTIPLE TENDONS CATEGORIES AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHOSE ATTENDANCE WAS PREVIOUSLY CATEGORIZED AS EXCELLENT SO OR OR CHRONIC- SO. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE CRISIS IS HITTING BOTH ENDS OF THE STUDENT SPECTRUM EXTREMELY HARD TO DO WOULD DO WE HAVE ANY INDICATION OF WHAT ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES WE NEED TO USE- IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL DATA ON. YOU KNOW ON WHO IT IS NOT SHOWING UP TO CLASS I KNOW- THE CITY- REPORTED THAT ARE BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS- THIS PAST YEAR- WERE SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF 80% OF THEM WEREN'T PASSING THEIR THEIR THEIR MATH. AT GRADE LEVEL SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS ACTUALLY BEING IMPACTED AND WHAT STRATEGIES WE NEED TO BE DISCUSSING. SO THIS TO THE CITY. CITY YOUR QUESTION. YEAH I HEARD THE QUESTION THANK YOU- I THINK WE AS THE SUPERINTENDENT MENTIONED IN HIS EARLIER- REMARKS WE AREN'T WORKING ON SOME PILOT PROGRAMS TO DELVE A SPECIFIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS US AS- OAKLAND YOU WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED BIT YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS HITTING A VARIETY OF AREAS- WE KNOW IT'S OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS ARE OFTEN NOT- THE SHOWING UP IN SCHOOLS- BUT WE ALSO HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS IMPACTING PUBLIC ACROSS THE- THE SPECTRUM. OF OUR STUDENTS SO WE ARE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TO- THAT TACTICS- AND I THINK THESE AND NEW INVESTMENTS IN OUR OF FROM THE STATE- ARE REALLY GOING TO HELP AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND LOOKING AT OUR EXPANDED LEARNING OPTIONS- TO BE ABLE TO SEE- THESE STUDENTS IN A WAY THAT THAT IS- OFFERING NEW. SERVICES AT TO UNDERSTAND WHY ME WHY ME THEY MAY NOT BE SHOWING UP AT SCHOOL SO- THERE ARE A YEAR THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE THIS IS BEEN SOMETHING THE SUPERINTENDENT IS FOCUSED ON I EVEN BEFORE HE ARRIVED- IF THIS- THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION- IN THE- PROGRAMS THAT HE PASSED THAT ARE BEING RIGHT NOW SINCE I'M TWENTY FOURTEEN I TO REALLY LOOK INTO THE IMPACTS OF CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND HOW BEST TO GET MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO UNDERSTAND- WHY OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT SHOWING UP SO WE ARE WORKING ON SOME PILOTS THAT SHOULD BE STARTING ACTUALLY MAY HAVE ALREADY STARTED- JUST THIS NEW YEAR. I WITH THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT WE ARE VERY HANDS ON IN OUR APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING WHERE STUDENTS ARE NOT SHOWING UP- I'M NOT SURE RANDY BUT NOW IF YOU'RE THERE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BRING IN DISCUSS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL- DATA THAT WE'RE SEEING FOR CHRONIC. ABSENCE MY NAME'S READY MONEY WORKING NELSON MEDINA COUNTY BILITY RIP TO BE IT'S- IS MADE OF YOU ARE. A THE DEPARTMENT RELEASED A CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM DATED THIS YEAR AFTER A PAUSE LAST YEAR. AND SO YOU KNOW AS AS WAS JUST MENTIONED THE- THE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM RATES INCREASED FOR THE LAW AND THAT THE LACK YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- YOU KNOW MOST NOTABLY AND- ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN WE TRY TO MAKE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND- OBVIOUSLY- IN THE AREA OF CONCERN THAT. ANOTHER APARTMENT IS. IS REALLY TRYING TO WORK ON- AND YOU KNOW. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE DATA THAT WE MAKE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND I HOPE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THAT DOES THE. DATA REFLECTED. LOCAL GIVING FEEDBACK THERE LOWER IN REAL TRYING. PEOPLE'S BALLS ONE HUNDRED AND EARLY- EIGHTEEN WE MAY SEE VALUE WITH X. OF ONCE YOU REACH A SIX YOU KNOW- IS IT JUST BEFORE IMPACT HI GROW SO HIRED RATE BUT WHAT THE I KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE SEE THAT. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ANY DAY ON ON INCREASE DROP OUT RATE BUT THIS MAKES THAT SO- IF YOU HAVE THAT IF YOU CAN SEND IT. I WOULD IT. IT IS A LOT ME RESET WHAT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING FOR YOU'RE ASKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM- CONDEMNED BY GREAT SPAM. CORRECT GRADE SPAN ALL AND YOU TO PUT AND POPULATION V. IS YES SIR NOW HE'S YEAH THAT THAT IN- MAKE AVAILABLE ARE DATAQUEST SITE BUT HAPPY TO PUT TOGETHER- SOME TIME TALKING POINTS- SUMMARIZING WHAT YOU ASK FOR AND SEND IT OVER. THANK YOU. YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER I JUST WANT TO ADD IN THERE- DURING THE WINTER OF LAST YEAR WE ACTUALLY HAD OUR ENTIRE EXECUTIVE TEAM MAKING PHONE TO DIRECTLY TO OF LISTS OF STUDENTS THAT WERE CHRONIC ABSENT AND MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND WAS THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL SCHOOL- MANY OF THE STUDENTS- WE'RE TAKING CARE OF FAMILY MEMBERS- THEY HAD TO WORK- THEIR PARENTS WERE ESSENTIAL WORKERS SO IT WAS VERY COMPLEX AND I KNOW THAT OUR SCHOOLS- REACHING OUT TO US BECAUSE THERE WAS REALLY A THEY HAD TRIED ALL THEIR INTERVENTION SO WE'RE HOPING THAT. WE CAN TURN THESE TRENDS AROUND- AS WE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND STUDENTS TO BE ABLE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES I WILL BE ABLE TO YOU- GET BACK TO SOME LEVEL OF NORMALCY AND- AND IN THE- OF THESE. THESE IS. THEY MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO THE ACT SCHOOLS- CAN BE DEALT WITH AND ADDRESSED ASSEMBLY MEMBER REST. THANK YOU MISTER. HELLO MY SPECIAL EDUCATION- COMMUTE COMMUNITY HAS CONTINUE TO. COMPLAIN ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND TO THE BIGGEST CONCERN THEY'VE HAD TO IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS SPENT. ON ATTORNEYS. ON LEGAL FEES IN DEFENDING A SCHOOL DISTRICT- AGAINST A FAMILY OR PARENT- ASKING FOR- FOR ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THEIR STUDENTS IS THERE ANYTHING THAT IS BEING ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY IN THE BUDGET TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY IS GOING MORE FOR THE THESE PLANS FOR THE STUDENTS AND FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF THE STUDENT. AS OPPOSED TO LEGAL FEES IS THERE A CAP ON LEGAL FEES. ARE THERE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- AMBER ALEXANDER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN GO AHEAD AND START AND- AND OTHERS ARE WELCOME TO CHIME IN IF THEY HAPPEN. INFORMATION BUT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WILL HEAR TE SPECIAL EDUCATION I BELIEVE THAT PANEL FOR AND THERE'S NOTHING'S. TO AND SPECIAL EDUCATION LEGAL FEES I WOULDN'T KNOW- LAST YEAR THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED MILLION- BUT HAVE PREPOSITION EIGHT FOCUSED. ON ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION- ALL. PERMITTING TEAM- BUT FROM RISING TO BE- A LEVEL WHERE YOU KNOW AT SIX SIX AMOUNT OF FUNDING WOULD HAVE TO BE PUT TOWARDS LEGAL FEES- IT'S AGAIN IT AND AT ONE COMING BACK. BECAUSE OF OVER MULTIPLE YEARS THAT I IS VERY STILL- IN AN ADDITIONAL YOUR LATER IN THIS PANEL WE DO HAVE. I'M A GENERAL BUT IT WILL IF YOU FUNDING GOING INTO THIS EDUCATION- BASEBALL THAT COULD NOT BE USED FOR THESE PURPOSES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S UNNECESSARY. USE I'M COURSE I WANT TO BECAUSE- THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING ACTUAL. SERVICE AND- EDUCATION. THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I HEAR FROM FAMILIES HAS TO DO WITH LEGAL FEES. MIGHT MIGHT NEXT. IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS CHRONIC ACT ABSENTEEISM. THE LACK OF DATA- AND I. THAT YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS. GIVEN IN RESPONSE. TO INDICATE THAT THERE ARE SOME DATA THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED. R. R. ELLIE AS ALREADY- SEPARATING THE INFORMATION THE DATA THAT THEY'RE TAKING ON ATTENDANCE. TO MAKE IT EASIER HAD THEY BEEN ELSE TO SEPARATE THAT INFORMATION. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO DETERMINE THE REASON FOR THE ABSENTEEISM. FOR THE ABSENCES AND THEN IF SO HOW IS THIS IN FOR BE YOU HER OF THE TO BE USED. REALLY COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. YES DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE REASONS WHY STUDENTS ARE ABSENT CARAVANS INCLUDES- EXCUSED ABSENCES UNEXCUSED ABSENCE AND INCOMPLETE INDEPENDENT STUDY AND ALSO SOME INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENTS WHO WERE ABSENT DUE TO SUSPENSION I'M I THINK THE WAY YOU'RE ASKING FOR PROBABLY HAS TO DO WITH- YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS WERE ABSENT DUE TO. REASONS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC AND OUR COLLECTION RIGHT NOW DOESN'T GO TO THAT GRANULAR OF A LEVEL SILICON WE COLLECT INFORMATION ON EXCUSED UNEXCUSED ABSENCES DUE TO SUSPENSION AND INCOMPLETE INDEPENDENT STUDY. WE ALSO MAKE THAT INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON OUR DATAQUEST WEBSITE- IN A REPORT CALLED ABSENTEEISM BY REASON WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT INFORMATION DISAGGREGATED BY VARIOUS STUDENT GROUPS- SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR MAY MISTER YES. I CAN FIND TO THE BUT- IT WAS ALSO DISCUSSED BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT LEAST ONE. THAT ABSENTEEISM HAS INCREASED IN 90% OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IF THIS IS TRUE THEN IT IS MUCH MORE A MUCH MORE SERIOUS ISSUE THAT IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. AND I WOULD SAY THAT REQUIRES MUCH MORE ATTENTION THAN IT HAS RECEIVED IN THE PAST. THAT THAT IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN ESPECIALLY SINCE WE DO KNOW THAT DO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABSENTEEISM THEM TALKING ABOUT LOSS OF. DAVIDOVICH OCCASION OF FOR MANY OF THE STUDENTS AND USUALLY THE STUDENTS OF COLOR AND THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY THIS. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE WE PUT ALL COLLECTED PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO INVEST THE MONEY. MORE MONEY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND HELP TO ALLEVIATE HELP TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF WE GIVE EVERYBODY THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. IT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RESOLVE THIS WE HAVE IT IF YOU PUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT 10% AS YOU DO IN HAT 90% OF THE 10% CLEARLY DOESN'T NEED THAT BUT THAT 90% DOES AND I JUST I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE. MAKING GREATER EFFORTS TO COLLECT THE DATA AND I WANT TO KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR REPORT APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING IT ON THE WEBSITE- BUT I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT. GIVING IT THE ATTENTION THAT WE SHOULD AT THIS TIME AS WERE COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO COME OUT OF IT. BUT SOME OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SUFFERING A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN OTHERS AND I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE GIVE THEM THE ATTENTION AND THE FINANCES THE RESOURCES THEY'RE GOING TO NEED. TO ADDRESS THIS CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM THAT IS AFFECTING THEM TO A DEGREE MUCH GREATER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER TOM GO BACK YOU IF YOU WANT TO RAISE ISSUE ENOUGH. THE WELL I JUST ONE OF THE HIGHER THEIR A QUESTION ABOUT WITH A GROUP WITH WITH REGARD TO LAWYERS FEES A COMMENT MADE ABOUT LAWYERS FEES. IN THE SPECIAL ED ARENA LAST YEAR.

THE POST FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM WOULD BE CONSIDERED EXCLUDABLE FROM THE CORPORATIONS LIMIT SO IF THE LEGISLATURE WORSHIPPED FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO YOU NOT EXEMPTS PRIORITIES THE STATE WOULD EXCEED THE LIMIT BY A LARGER AMOUNT BUT THAT- INCLUDING COMMENTS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTION AT THE APPROPRIATE.

FOR SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- AND YOU KNOW- JUST TO TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT OF THE PROGRAM WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR PROGRAM TO INCLUDE FULL DAY GINGER. WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT THIS NEW TRANSITION AND WE HAVE AWARDED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- FORTY SOME PROJECTS DURING. MAY IN OCTOBER TWO NINETEEN. AND DEFINITELY EXPAND THE- WITH THE FOR HOW NINETY NINE DOLLARS A PART OF. CURRENT BUDGET. AND WE HAVE A NOW WEDNESDAY. BOARD AND FOR ROUND FOR THAT HUNDRED MILLION. SO THAT WE TO FINALLY. ONE APRIL. TWENTY TWENTY FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AND A SUBSCRIBER. THAT OPEN IN APRIL TWENTY THREE. FOR THE REMAINING FUNDS ARE TO FIFTY POINT MILLION DOLLARS. I'M TO GIVE YOU OVER OF SOME OF THE PER THAT WE DO- HAVE IS NEW CAN. AND MODERNIZATION. AND THE FACILITY HARDSHIPS. IS ALSO A COMPONENT THAT STILL HURTS YOU PROGRAM IT COVERS SIDE SEISMIC MITIGATION- WE HAVE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAM. I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED- SOME OF OUR LIST. WE WANT TO COVER THAT- WHAT THE LIST MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO LISTEN MAINTAINED AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE DISTINCTION OF THOSE LAST. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN UNFUNDED LIST WHICH IS REPRESENTS PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED. AND ON THE LACK OF AB FIFTY FIVE LOANS SO THEY RIGHT. A PRODUCT APPROVAL BY SILICON BOARD WITHIN THEIR WAITING. PROGRAM CASH AS A RESULT OF BOND SALES. AND THAT HELPS MANAGE THANK CASH FLOW PUT A PER. SO THIS A HIGH SIXTY TWO PROJECTS TO FOUR SIXTY THREE SEVEN MILLION WAITING FOR CASH FOR BOND SALE. AND THAT'S AGAIN THE CURRENT UNFUNDED LIST THAT WE HAVE. WE ALSO HAVE AN APPLICATION RECEIVED BEYOND BONTA THIRTY- AND THAT IS A PROBLEM LISTED. BECAUSE THERE'S OVER- IF A- MENTIONED POINT BILLION DOLLARS. A PROJECTS THAT ARE WAITING FOR FUNDING THESE PROJECTS ARE ACCEPTED- WHETHER OFFICE BUT AGAIN WE'RE NOT PROCESSING THESE APPLICATIONS- SO IS OVER NINE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR. PROJECTS THAT REPRESENT OVER THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND AGAIN THEY HAVE EVERY COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL MEANING THEY HAVE A DEPARTMENT EDUCATION- APPROVAL. THE REGISTER ARCHITECT PLAN APPROVAL BUT WE'RE NOT PROCESSING THE APPLICATIONS WERE JUST ACCEPTING THEM SO WITH THAT IS OUR INFORMATION LIST. AND AGAIN I'LL JUST QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT THE FUNDING PROCESS AGAIN. IT DISTRICT MUST COME AND WITH A DEPART OF EDUCATION APPROVAL. AND ALSO DSA- DIVISIONS THAT ARCHITECT APPROVAL BEFORE COMING INTO PROGRAM TO APPLY FOR FUNDS. AND AGAIN THAT'S THE FIRST STEP OF THE PROCESS- WE ALSO ESTABLISH WHETHER NOT THE APPLICANT IS- MEETS ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. AND THIS CAN BE DONE IN ADVANCE OR TO YOU THANK. AND THE SECOND STEP OF THAT PROCESS IS ALSO SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION WITH OUR OFFICE. AND THEN THE STARS IS OUR PROGRAM REVIEWS IT IN AGAIN. DISCOUNT ACCRETION MORE FOR. AND THE NEXT STEP IS BASICALLY TO WAIT FOR. PROGRAM CASH AS A RESULT THE BOND. SALES SO WITH THAT- I WOULD TRAVEL. SHARE MY AND- BY MICHAEL OUR PROGRAM BACKGROUND WITH MICHAEL BARBECUE. HOW THEY YOU. MR O'DONNELL BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST I JUST WANTED TO HIGH THE SCHOOL FIRST A THE STATE CALIFORNIA- THEY ARE A- AND THERE WAS AN AUDITOR REPORT JUST A ON THE SCHOOL PROGRAM. THAT COMPLIMENTED THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM ALSO COMPLIMENTED THAT HELPS DISTRICTS OUT OF HARDSHIP THOSE DISTRICTS THAT KEPT UP CAN'T CAN'T TO SECURE THEIR LIVES CAN'T SECURE LOCAL BONDS OF LOCAL LEVEL FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- THE REPORT CITED THAT THERE WELL OVER SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SEVEN POINT POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN IN IN IN IN SKIN SCHOOL NEEDS ON THE MODERNIZATION FRONT. AND THERE IS ALSO- NEED ON THE NEW CONSTRUCTION FRONT AND- SCHOOL SCHOOL FACILITIES ACTUALLY IMPACT THE HOUSE THE COST OF HOUSING AS WELL BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT SCHOOL BONDS THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW SCHOOLS ARE PUT ON- EVERY INDIVIDUAL HOUSE THAT IS BUILT AND THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY SO THEY DO IMPACT THE- THE COST OF HOUSING AS WELL. SO WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS MORE CONVERSATION- WHETHER IT BE THROUGH BOND OR AN ALLOCATION OF WHAT WE HAVE A LOT OF THIS YEAR- ONE TIME MONEY OUTSIDE OF NINETY EIGHT FOR SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THAT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR OKAY. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA KNOW THE I THINK- OUR A REALLY- GOOD YOU OF WANT MONIES. WITH THE WITH THE SITUATION WE HAVE- WE SHOULD BE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET- OFF OF CONVERSATIONS ON. THANK YOU BEGAN- ISSUE AND- WHAT THE STATE- CANDY CAN'T DO AND SO. USING ONE TIME MONIES FOR APPROPRIATE THINGS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK ARE KEY AND CERTAINLY SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE AT THE TOP A LIST I ALSO HAVE A IMPORTANT PROPOSAL ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION SIDE FOR STUDENT HOUSING. WHICH OUR TO ARE THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT WE PUT IN OUR ASSEMBLY. BLUEPRINT IN DECEMBER AND THOSE ARE STE HIGH ON OUR PRIORITY LIST THEY WERE INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THAT HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL AND AGAIN THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET SO ARE TURNED UP. BUT OUR FINGERPRINTS ON THIS WE ALSO NOTE THAT WE THINK THERE- BECAUSE OF THE REVENUE ESTIMATES FROM THE L. A. L. THAT THEY WORK PROPERLY- THE CALIFORNIA JANUARY GOVERNOR PROPOSAL AS WELL AS INCREASES COMING IN SINCE THEN SO WE THINK WE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. WITH ONE TIME MONEY TO ADDRESS BOTH THESE ISSUES- BUT I CAN KERN WE NEED TO ADDRESS BOTH NEW CONSTRUCTION AND- MODERNIZATION ESPECIALLY AS WE- LOOK AT CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF OUR SCHOOLS AND THE ATTENDANCE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. THIS IS. BECAUSE OR COMMENTS SAYING NINE FIFTY NUMBER. SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE. HI GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS- CAN YOU ALRIGHT. YEAH. BUT THE FINANCE. YES MANY HERE YOU GO AHEAD THANKS FOR YOUR- AS MANY IN THE FIELD HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS THAT I CAN SENSE OUR GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FIRST. AND THE SPECIAL EDUCATION INVESTMENT IN THIS YEAR'S- BUDGET CONTINUES THE ADMINISTRATION AND EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE INTEGRATED IN THE ALLEYS APPROACH PLANNING FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND GREATER ALIGNMENT WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING FOR ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND THIS YEAR'S PROPOSALS WERE DEVELOPED BOTH AND ATTENTION TO THE CHALLENGES THAT ELLIE IS CONTINUE TO NAVIGATE AND COPE IT. AND TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. SERVING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. SO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACTING NO INCREASES IN RESOURCES AND SUPPORTED PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. SO TO BUILD UPON BECAUSE INVESTMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PREVENT PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IN SPECIAL EDUCATION BASE FUNDING AND IN ADDITION TO THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION INCLUDED FOR GROWTH IN COLOR. AND JUST FOR REFERENCE THAT. INCREASE WOULD. HOW TO. TWENTY DOLLARS PER EIGHTY AT. IN ADDITION TO FUNDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUSINESS TO CALCULATE SPECIAL EDUCATION BASE FUNDING- ALLOCATE AT THE ALLEY IT LEVEL RATHER THAN ON SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREA OR SELF LEVEL AND- THIS WOULD PROVIDE TRAINS IMPROVE LED IS ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR FUNDING COPPER PROGRAM PLANNING ADDITIONALLY IT BEST BETTER TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR OF EARLY EIGHTIES WHEN CALCULATING THE BASE FUNDING AND FUNDING WILL STILL CONTINUE TO FLOW TO SELF AS- THE SPECIAL EDUCATION EXTRAORDINARY COPS PULLS INTO A SINGLE COST POOL TO STREAMLINE THE CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE. THIS IS INTENDED TO PURELY BE A TECHNICAL CHANGE SO NO PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES ARE BEING PROPOSED. AND THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES TO ALLOCATE THE EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR ARMS FUNDING DIRECTLY TO ELLIE IS RATHER THAN TO SOUTH AS- SO ALL OTHER FRONT. ENTRANCE IT'S FOR DIRECTLY TO. AS WAS FLEX IN TWENTY TWENTY TO BENEFIT ALL STUDENTS SO THIS IS CLEAN UP TO ALIGN YOUR PREPARATION TO HOW ALL OTHER UNRESTRICTED. TWENTY THREE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL FUNDS DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE POOLING OF RESOURCES INTO REGIONAL SERVICES AND SMALL ONLY A IS ALREADY WORK WITH THEIR COUNTY IS TO OBTAIN HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS SO THE SHIP DOES NOT DISRUPT THOSE PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS. I DON'T RESPONSIBILITY COMES FROM THE FIELD FOR MORE COORDINATION BETWEEN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION PLANNING THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A SPECIAL EDUCATION AND UP TO THE L. CAP THAT WOULD SUPPORT INCLUSIVE PLANNING AND PROMOTE COHESION BY LINKING SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION OKAY PLANNING. THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THIS AGENDA IS INTENDED TO MERE THE PROCESS THAT CD IN S. B. E. HAS USED IN THE PAST SUCH AS FOR BUDGET AS FOR THE BUDGET OVERVIEW FOR PARENTS- THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES TO MODIFY EXISTING ALCOTT PARENT ADVISORY GROUP REQUIREMENTS TO EXPLICITLY INCLUDE PARENTS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES TO REFOCUS AND EXIST SPECIAL EDUCATION RESOURCE LEAD ON A. P. BEST PRACTICES IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND ESTABLISH AN EXPERT PANEL USING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND- ID A FUNDS TO CONTINUE REFINING THE MODEL A. P. TEMPLATE THAT WAS DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE RECENT WORKGROUP CONVENED BY. THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES TO BUILD UPON THE ALTERNATE PATHWAYS TO DIPLOMA WORK GROUP'S EFFORT BY. EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE COURSE WORK OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLETION OF THE STATE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. IN THIS WOULD USE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IDA FUNDS AND- SALAS SHE GAVE. PALATABLE FOR STUDENTS TO TAKE THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE ASSESSMENT. AND THOUGHT I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE TIME OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE HERE FROM ELIA. IN THE LEAD WITH ALLIE- AGAIN- SINCE THERE ARE MULTIPLE PROPOSALS UNDER THE SPECIAL EDUCATION ITEM I WILL JUST WALK THROUGH THE ALEJO COMMENTS FOR EACH OF THESE PROPOSAL STARTING ON PAGE TWENTY FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA. SO FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THE PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BASE AUGMENTATION WE THINK THIS IS A PRUDENT WAY DISPENSED TO INCREASE POP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AND ADDRESS THE LOCAL COST PRESSURES- THAT HAVE BEEN. RELATED TO SPECIAL GROWING SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS. NOW TURNING TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MODIFY THE BASE RATE FORMULA SO IN THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CALCULATE ATTENDANCE AT THE ALLEY A LEVEL RATHER THAN THE TOP LEVEL JUST AS A REMINDER SELFIES OR SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS ARE REGIONAL CONSORTIA OF LEDS THAT COORDINATES SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES. AND FUNDING WHAT'S TYPICALLY A LARGE DISTRICTS ACTING AS THEIR OWN SELF THAT WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL QUESTION TO THE SOUTHWEST AT ALL HAVE A GOOD MIX OF BOTH GROWING AND DECLINING. LIAISE SO JUST WALK A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDER CURRENT LAW A MEMBER DISTRICT WITH GROWING ATTENDANCE COULD HAVE THEIR GAINS OFFSET BY ANOTHER MEMBER DISTRICTS WITH DECLINING ATTENDANCE IN CONTRAST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALLOWS ANY ALLEY ATTENDANCE GROWTH TO ESSENTIALLY BE LOCKED IN AT THE ALLEY A LEVEL. AND THAT GROWTH WOULD GENERATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING EVEN IF THE SOFTWARE IS OVERALL DECLINING ENROLLMENTS- SO NEXT WE MOVE ON TO THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE I. E. P. TEMPLATE THAT ALTERNATE PATHWAY TO A TO COMMENT- WE FIND THAT THESE PROPOSALS LACKS SPECIFIC TIMELINES AND EXPECTATIONS. FOR INSTANCE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOESN'T SPECIFY A DATE BY WHICH THE ALTERNATE COURSE WORK OR ACTIVITIES MUST BE FINALIZED OR BE MADE AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS. SINCE OUR SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE BE INTERESTED IN FINDING THESE ACTIVITIES WE RECOMMEND IT SPECIFY CLEAR DEADLINES AS WELL AS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE MONITORING OUTCOMES OF THESE ACTIVITIES. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO. CONSIDER SETTING X. WAS IT DEADLINES THE STATE TO ADOPT. A STATEWIDE I TEN OR A PATHWAYS IF THE- LIGHTLY. IS IN EMPLOYMENT THESE POWER. MOVING ON NEXT TO THE POOL TO ALLOCATE A MAN HEALTH TO. RATHER THAN SOME AS- WE JUST LET LEARN MORE ABOUT THE IN OF THE PROPOSAL EXPRESSED HOW IT MAY AFFECT REGIONALLY COORDINATED PROGRAMS AND SCHOOL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS ALTHOUGH SOME SELFIES ALLOCATE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THE MEMBER AND THOSE WITH SMALLER LEDS ROUTINE AND THIS FINDING OUT THE SAMPLE LEVEL AND PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS IN THESE CASES THE MEMBER ELOISE MIGHT TYPICALLY JUST BE TOO SMALL AND WOULD NOT RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO HIRE THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH STAFF AND PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON THEIR OWN. THIS HOLES COULD ALSO IMPACT SCHOOL MEANT HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS WHICH THE STATE HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS UNDER THESE PARTNERSHIPS IZAPA FOR EXAMPLE COULD DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHICH THEN PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO SCHOOL IN SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY THIS PROPOSAL COULD POSE SOME CHALLENGES FOR THESE PARTNERSHIPS MAKING THESE PROGRAMS MORE ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME SINCE COUNTIES WITH ANY TO ARRANGE SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH EACH ALLOCATE TO PARTICIPATE OR POTENTIALLY REDUCE TOTAL FUNDING AVAILABLE. IF AN ALLEY GATE DECIDES TO PULL FUNDING FROM THE PARTNERSHIP IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN INSTANCE ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THESE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE COUNTY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE- PROPOSAL AND I DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THESE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO THESE REGIONAL PROGRAMS AND PARTNERS. NOW IT'S TURNING OUT TO EXTRA COST POOL- AS FINANCING I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SEEMS KIND OF CONSISTENT WITH HOW CURRENT LAW OPERATES- LAST THREE WE WANT EXTRAS THAT WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSALS TO DEVELOP THE SPECIAL EDUCATION ATTENDANT TO THE OIL CAP OR ESTABLISHED IP BEST PRACTICES WE SOURCE WE- I'M A LOT OF PROPOSAL WE DO KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE ME. JUST WANT TO REQUIRE IF THEY NEED RESOURCE REPEAT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE WHY IP TEMPLATE TO ENSURE THAT. ANY STATEWIDE NICHOLAS TO THE STATE ON I PIECE IS GOING TO WITH THAT FOR IP TEMPLATE. I'M THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY ANSWER ANY AT THE- TIME THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. VERY NICE. IN BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPER- WE APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE RELEASE OF THE TRAILER BILL AND FURTHER DETAILS OF THE PROPOSALS THIS YEAR'S PROPOSALS ALLOW FOR INCREASED COLLABORATION AND TRANSPARENCY AT ALL LEVELS OF OUR SYSTEM ESPECIALLY BETWEEN CVD SILVA AND ALLEGHENY THE PROPOSED FUNDING PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ENSURING THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND AT THE CENTER ARE AT THE CENTER OF OUR WORK. SPECIFICALLY WELL THE PROPOSED CHANGE TO CALCULATE FUNDING AT THE ONLY A LEVEL RATHER THAN SELF LEVEL WITH FOSTER INCREASED COLLABORATION AND TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN SILVA AND THEIR MEMBER ELLIE ACE THE LEDS THIS INCREASED LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY CREATES A GREATER LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR ITS CITY. IF THE MENTAL HEALTH WILL THE L. A. WITH THE MY DIRECTLY. THIS DOES NOT RESIST ELEAZAR TO ENTER INTO A REGIONAL AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND IT ALSO ALLOWS THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THEIR OWN NEEDS AND COORDINATE ACROSS STUDENT POPULATIONS- WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THE LEGISLATURE ON THESE PROPOSALS MOVING FORWARD AND I HAVE WITH ME HAVE A CALUMNIES THE DIRECTOR OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION AT THE DEPARTMENT- TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU FOR THE- PRESENTATION. OKAY. I KNOW YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT THE- ABOUT SPECIAL ED SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT AND SEE WHAT'S BEEN THAT MAY REVISED AND POTENTIALLY LOOK FOR ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR. ASSEMBLY ACTION AS WELL. YES MR BY ADDRESS. SO THE STATE KERN PROVIDE A TOTAL SIX MILLION TO REMEMBER SELFLESS FOR HIGH COST STUDENT SERVICES AND PLACEMENTS ESTIMATED TO COVER ONLY ABOUT TWENTY ONE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR ELIGIBLE COST IS THE MINISTRATION OF OPEN TO INCREASING THE FUNDING PROVIDED TO COVER THESE EXTORT EXTRAORDINARY SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS INVESTING IN A TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILLION WOULD REALLY GO A LONG WAY I THINK TO THREE SMOOTHING OUT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FOR SELFLESS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BECAUSE OPEN TO THE- SO- IN THE PAST ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT ENSURING PLACEMENTS INTO THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. SO AT THIS TIME WE ARE CONCERNED THAT PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THIS COST POOL WOULD INCENTIVIZE PLACEMENTS INTO MORE RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTS HOWEVER AT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DID INCLUDE A STEP HE- ON THE PLACEMENT AND- PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND AGENCIES SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE OUTCOMES OF OUR STUDENTS IN THOSE PLACEMENTS. WHEN THE REPORT COMES OUT IN TWENTY THREE. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. CAN LET ISSUED NO TO PAY CM. WE HAVE TRAFFIC MATH AND ART- IN YOUR PRESENTATION FOR MR FINE.
