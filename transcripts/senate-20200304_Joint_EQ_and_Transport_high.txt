HOPING OUR SERGEANTS WILL PUT OUT A CALL TO OUR COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND BOTH COMMITTEES BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A GOOD ROBUST. DISCUSSION HERE WE'VE GOT A FANTASTIC GROUP OF PANELISTS- ON A ON A FASCINATING AND VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC WHICH HAS TO DO WITH CALIFORNIA'S RISING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS IT'S AN AREA OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN. FOLLOWING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE STATE IS TRYING TO BE A REACHES- AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS AND CONTINUE TO BE A GREAT DEAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF THE MAKING IN THE AREA TRANSPORTATION WHICH REALLY DO- ACCOUNT FOR. NEARLY HALF OF OUR- THEY- SO WE- TOGETHER EXPERTS. BOTH SIDES OF THE- POLICY HOUSE BOTH FROM- OUR FRIENDS IN THE AIR BOARD OUR FRIENDS IN TRANSPORTATION AND THEN OF COURSE WE BROUGHT TOGETHER- FOLKS FROM LA- AND THEN THE NUMBER OF PROFESSORS IN. AND THOUGHT LEADERS OF FOR OUR FINAL PANEL SO IT'S GONNA BE A FANTASTIC I THINK AN INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE. MORNING THAT I HOPE WILL LEAD TO SOME. BEING UP. OUT I KNOW PUBLIC. IS OUR- RESIDENT EXPERT IN THIS AREA IT'S GONNA BE A VERY CAREFULLY. HOW DID THINGS GO YESTERDAY. GOOD ON IDEA ASSEMBLY ONLY GOT OKAY SORRY MMHM ALL RIGHT HERE I HERE YOU'RE HERE WAS A THIS IS YOUR MOMENT TO SO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA GETS BELOW ME LET ME OVER THE MICROPHONE AS CENTER CENTER WHOSE ARCHER FISHING TO ME. MORE EVERYBODY. AND THE SENATE BUT COMMITTEE COUPLE AGO WE HAVE A PRISON ON GREEN GAS THE MISSION GOALS AND REDUCTION ACTS CITIES IN THE CAP AND PRO. AND THAT WAS KIND OF IN THE BROUGH CON OF THE JUST TODAY TO WE'RE GONNA FOR. AND DIG DEEPER ON THE LEARN ABOUT OUR READER PROGRAM FROM A TREE. PERSPECTIVE AND- THE NUMBER THEY CAME WITH FORTY PER. OF OUR GREENHOUSE. IMAGE COME FROM TRANCE SO THAT WE'RE HEAR MORE THAT WITH THE HERE IS IN A OUR- OF OUR ECONOMY THE TRANS SECTOR THAT'S GOING TO GET MY CLEANER. NOW FOR ME THE COURT IS HOW WE CAN DO THIS IN A WAY WHICH DOESN'T. OF COURSE PROMISES MADE TO THE WITH AS ONE BECAUSE WE WE'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THAT PASS AND IT IS SO WE WANT TO DO IN A WAY WHERE IT'S HOPEFULLY. AN EASY WAY TO DO IT FOR THE VOTERS IN THE STATE DOESN'T IMPOSE ON ON JUST BURDEN ON THOSE WHO LEAST CAN BEAR IT THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT I I'M INTERESTED IN SO- I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE POSITION OF LOOKING AT. ISSUES WHETHER THEY'RE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SOCIAL ISSUES ECONOMIC ISSUES FROM A- SOCIAL JUSTICE- PERSPECTIVE. I'VE ALWAYS HAD AND WE HAVE TO BE SMART. ABOUT OUR REDUCTION PROGRAMS- THAT WE IMPOSE ON THE TRANSORTATION SUCH SECTORS SO WE NEED TO EXPLORE THE SUBJECT A LITTLE BIT. THINK ABOUT IT AND- COME UP WITH SOME ACTIONS. PUBLIC TRANSIT CAN PLAY A LARGE ROLE HERE IN MY OPINION- ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HOW IT CAN BE MADE MORE EFFECTIVE AS A TOOL TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AND I REALIZE WE HAVE A LOT TO WORK TO DO SO. THIS HEARING WILL GIVE US MORE CONCRETE SENSE. ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. HELP US MAKE JUDGMENTS ON HOW BEST. SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY COME FOR THE MORNING SESSION HERE AND- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WILL I GUESS WE'LL START. YEAH SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BRINGING TOGETHER TWO OF OUR STATES LEADERS IN THIS AREA- DB KIM SECTOR OF CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND MARY NICHOLS CHAIR OF OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD UP. CLOSE IN A CASKET YOU WANNA MAKE A OF AN OPEN COMMON TO OKAY ALL RIGHT SO LET'S START WITH SECRETARY AND WE'LL BE HEARING ARCHER NICHOLS. AND THIS IS A- AND- GRIP TO FROM FOLKS MINISTRATION. THE BILL AND SENATOR WHITE YOU'D GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER TO OUR COMMITTEES HOW WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AS I MENTIONED DETERMINE BILLS COMMITTEE JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. WE ARE HEAVILY FOCUSED ON KEY PRIORITIES SUCH AS IMPROVING STATE OF GOOD REPAIR. MAXIMIZING EFFICIENCIES. AND DELIVERING ON THE PROMISES OF SB ONE. THESE EFFORTS ARE FRONT AND CENTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE WE ALSO HAVE A LEADERSHIP ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PLAY INTO IN TERMS OF COMBAT IN CLIMATE CHANGE. THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND NINETEEN NINETEEN. CALLS ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT 40% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COMES FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. SO THOSE OF US WHO WORK AT TRANSPORTATION HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. PROMOTING GREATER ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IS CLEARLY A KEY STRATEGY. BUT IT GOES BEYOND THAT RESEARCH AND MODELING ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND ENCOURAGING MODE SHIFT MUST ALSO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WHAT ARE THE KEY IS TO MODE SHIFT IS TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FINANCE A SAFE ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE RELIABLE AND FREQUENT- WAYS OF TRAVELING. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO WALK BIKE TAKE TRANSIT IN USE MARKHAM ABILITY ENSURED MOBILITY OPTIONS THE MORE WE CAN REDUCE VMT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAKES NUMEROUS INVESTMENTS TO DRESSES THERE'S ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN CONTINUING FUNDING FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND FOR CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL. TRANSIT AND INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL LOW CARBON TRANSIT OPERATIONS AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. I JUST FUNDING FROM SB FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH THIS MISSION. I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF REVIEWING APPLICATIONS FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM OR ALSO KNOWN AS T. I. R. C. P. THE PROGRAM SUPPORTS PROJECTS. RESTRAINED OF SERVICE AND PROVIDE A MORE SEAMLESS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. T. I. R. C. P. HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN FIVE POINT THREE BILLION IN CAPITAL FUNDING SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND WE WILL BE AWARDING AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN GRANTS IN APRIL. THE MAJOR PROJECTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY GROW RIDERSHIP INCLUDE PARTNERSHIPS ON SOME OF THE LARGEST PROJECTS IN THE STATE NOW I WANT TO MENTION A FEW EXAMPLES. RECENTLY PASSED. FOR BART IN THE STATE. WE WOULD ALLOW ABOUT TOUR THOUSAND YOUR TO BE TAKEN TO. ADDING NEW REAL CARS BILL IN CALIFORNIA FOR COMMUTING HELLO MORE RIGHT TO BE AT THE MO CAN JUST. TIMES OF DAY. EXTENDING TO SAN JOSE AND OCT AND GROWING TO PASS ON. ADDING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED DAY RIDERS ON ALL THESE TWO SYSTEM. A MULTI BILLION PARTNER WITH HEALTH METRO CITY OF LA O. T. AND NATURALLY TO BRING SERVICE INCREASES. NEW LIGHT AND RAPID ROUTE. AND NEW SERVICE TO DISCOVER COMMUNITIES ALSO ALLOW HER OF THOUSAND OF NEW DEHLI TRIPS TO BE. WATCHING YOU REAL SERVE IN SANTA. REDLANDS AND HONEST COAST. INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF. TO SEND YOU. SANTA BARBARA AND SANTA OBISPO. AND SUPPORTING YOU COMMUTER RAIL SERVICES TO REDLANDS AND ON COASTER. LAUNCHING NEW ACER ASUS SERVICE SERIES. RESURGENCE ARE. AS WELL AS AS A AND SAN JOAQUIN TO SO. ADDING THOUSAND OF NEW JUST WRITERS DAY. HELPING THE GROWTH OF MISS BUS IN THE STATE STOCKTON FRESNO. HELLO VALLEY AND MANY OTHER OF THIS. THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT PROGRAM LIKE TO I. R. C. P. WILL OF THE GOVERNOR EXACTLY ORDER AND CHANGE. WHICH DIRECTS START TO LEVERAGE. FUNDING REDUCE GREEN GAS. AND MEDICAID CLIMATE IMPACTS. MEDIA CLIMATE GOALS WILL WORK US TO EMBED. CLIMATE CHANGE CONSIDERATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION POLICY PLANNING. PROGRAMMING AND PROJECT DELIVERY AS WELL AS OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. NOW MANY OF THESE CHANGES ALL ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY AND PRISSY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT THE DIRECTIVE IS A CALL TO ACTION TO DO MORE. CAL STAR IS LEADING THE CREATION OF A TRANSPORTATION ACTION PLAN. TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE ACTION PLAN WE DEVELOPED THROUGH BROAD STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT INCLUDING LISTENING SESSIONS FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO SHARE IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS ON THE CREATION OF THE ACTION PLAN. WHAT'S THE DRUG PLAN IS DEVELOPED. THERE WILL ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC FEEDBACK. THE ACTION PLAN WILL INCLUDE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR ATTENTION AND MANY OF THESE EFFORTS ARE WELL UNDERWAY. FOR EXAMPLE SOLUTIONS TO ENCOURAGE MODE SHIFT AND HELP REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCY ON SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES INCLUDE. BUILDING AN INTEGRATED STATEWIDE RAIL TRANSIT NETWORK CENTERED AROUND THIS CALIFORNIA STATE REAL PLAN. INCREASING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL TO VMT REDUCTION AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND THE WAY TO BOLSTER RIDERSHIP IS TO INCREASE THE SAFETY ACCESSIBILITY RELIABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF TRANSIT SERVICE. IN ORDER ON THAT POINT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE CALIFORNIA INTEGRATED TROUBLE PROJECT OR THIS INITIATIVE TO FACILITATE EASY AND ACCESSIBLE TRAVEL PLANNING AND PAYMENT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. KELLY T. P. IS ALL ABOUT MAKING TRAVELERS SOME TROUBLE SIMPLER AND COST EFFECTIVE BY ENHANCING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. ONE SEAMLESS PAYMENT PLAN FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT STRATEGY TO ENCOURAGE MODE SHIFT AND REDUCE VMT IS EXPANDING BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND DOING SO IN A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE MANNER. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IS A CRITICAL FIRST AND LAST MILE SOLUTION TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE AROUND WITHOUT A VEHICLE. ALSO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS CAN SUPPORT AFFORDABLE INFILL HOUSING YOUR JOBS. THE IDEA IS TO ADVANCE PROJECTS THAT HELP PROMOTE THE RIGHT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE INCREASING HOUSING YOUR KEY EMPLOYMENT CENTERS WILL HELP REDUCE THE DISTANCE PEOPLE NEED TO DRIVE. ADDITIONALLY WHEN TACKLING CONGESTION. WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE DEMAND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES RATHER THAN HI WE CAPACITY EXPANSION WHERE FEASIBLE. THIS INCLUDES STRATEGIES LIKE EQUITABLE APPLICATIONS OF ROADWAY PRICING WHETHER IT BE MANAGED LANES ARE MORE INNOVATIVE PRICING STRATEGIES SUCH AS COURTING PRICING WHICH IS BEING PURSUED IN WEST LA BY LA METRO AND SCATTERED. FURTHERMORE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITATES THE ADOPTION OF CLEAN VEHICLES AND WE CAN DO THIS BY SUPPORTING THE DEPLOYMENT OF SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT. INCLUDING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR INVESTMENTS. ALSO WE NEED TO FACE THE REALITY THAT CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE ALREADY HERE. INCORPORATING CLIMATE RESILIENCY INTO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. THESE PRINCIPLES WILL DRIVER DECISION MAKING ON WHAT TYPES OF ACTIONS TO UNDERTAKE AS WE IMPLEMENT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE HAVE DISCRETIONARY TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WE WILL USE IT WHERE FEASIBLE TO ALIGN WITH THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. WE ARE TAKING A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT OUR PLANNING PROGRAMMING AND PROJECT DELIVERY FUNCTIONS INCLUDE SCOPING FUNDING AND BUILDING PROJECTS THAT WILL MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. AS WELL AS SB AS WELL SB ONES FIXES FIRST PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR PAVEMENT. BRIDGES DRAINAGE AND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT WE ARE HEAVILY FOCUSED ON MULTIPLE FRONTS TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF OUR HIGHWAYS ROADS AND BRIDGES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. UNDERTAKING EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS INCLUDING ADVANCING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND ENCOURAGING GRAY REMOTE SHIFTED BY INVESTING IN TRANSIT AND PASSENGER REAL ALONG WITH ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECRETARY CÃM HOURS LET'S NOW HEAR FROM CHAIR NICHOLS AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION OF THE PANEL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M MARY NICHOLS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND I WANT TO- ALSO- ECHO I SECRETARY KIM'S REMARKS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT AND USEFUL IT IS THAT WE HAVE THESE TWO COMMITTEES- MEETING TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC- WE CAN'T ACHIEVE OUR AIR QUALITY OR CLIMATE GOALS. OR PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WITHOUT TACKLING EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATON SECTOR SO I'M GONNA DO A VERY BRIEF I HOPE OVERVIEW OF THE STATE AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TRANS. BEFORE DISCUSSING OUR GOALS AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO- FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS IN PLACE ALREADY THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE- PREVALENCE OCCUR. POLLUTANTS THE EASIEST ONE TO FIVE ON AND IF YOU THE PRINT SLICE THAT WE HANDED OUT AT THE BEGINNING I'M GONNA TRY TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE- CHARTS AS WELL- SO THE FIRST ONE SHOWS YOU THE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND- IT FOCUSES ON KNOCKS NITRIC. OXIDE BECAUSE NITROGEN OXIDE IS A PRECURSOR THE MAIN THE MAIN INGREDIENT IF YOU WILL AND CREATING SMOG OR OWES. WITH WE- ALL DEALING WITH CALIFORNIA A ALTHOUGH OZONE IN A OF ITSELF IS NOW. A KILLER IN THE SAME WAY AS FIND. KNOX'S ACT I CAN TO BOTH AND SO IT BECAME KIND OF THE INITIAL POLLUTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON MOBILE SO. ARE RISK FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS HERE- AND INCREASINGLY WE'VE CLEANED UP ENGINES AND WE'VE CLEANED UP FUELS AND WE'VE GOT INCENTIVES IN PLACE TO TURN OVER THE VEHICLE FLEET. ALL OF WHICH HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTIONS THAT YOU CAN SEE IN THESE VERY TINY NUMBERS HERE ON THIS SLIDE- BUT AT THE KEY THE KEY THING IS- OBVIOUSLY THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO GO. AND UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE AND IN THE HEALTH BASED STANDARDS WE STILL ARE AND SEEING INCREASES AND VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WHICH IS WHERE WE GET THE- BURNING OF DOLE'S FASSEL FEELS IN TURN. LEADS TO THE KNOX. SO JUST THIS AHEAD YOU SEE ON THE FIFTH PAGE OF THIS HANDOUT WE DID. THAT WE'RE SEEING GREENHOUSE GAS. HER UNIT OF. AT YOU TO. GDP GOING DOWN. BY THE OVERALL A NUMBERS STILL GOING. WHILE POPPY. IS STAYING THE SAME. ENDS RALLY FOR I SHOULD SAY THE TRENDS ARE REAL FOR AT THE MOMENT. AND SO WE'D BE IN OUR- IS NOT A NOT A MUCH AS NEEDED IT TO BE IN ORDER TO MEET. OUR GOT ENTRANCE MISSION IS THE BILL MAHER. OF ALL OF THE QUEUE. CONTRIBUTORS PASCAL EMISSIONS SO WE HAVE GOALS ON THE BOOKS RIGHT FOUND THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK TOWARD A- LUCK BEGINNING ON PAGE. HERE HELLO. HAS BEEN THE KEY TO OUR- AND I REGULAR TO ACTIVE IN THIS AREA- AND ALL WE HAVE ORDERS IN PLACE NOW THAT WOULD GET US TO A 100% NEW CAR SALES IS BEING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. INCLUDING SCHOOL BUSES MARINE AND PORT AND AIRPORT EQUIPMENT ALL CAN BE STATUS SHOT TO THE AIRPORT- THE END THERE MENDES OUT OF ACT. GOING ON IN AREA BUT WE NEED TO ACT ACCORDING TO CARBS ANALYSIS HAVE ALL PASSENGER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD BE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND THAT COULD INCLUDE FUEL CELLS NOT JUST BATTERY ELECTRIC BUT SOMEHOW ZERO EMISSION. TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHERE OBVIOUSLY VERY LONG WAY FROM THAT OR RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO BE REDUCING THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PER CAPITA AND- WE NEED TO HAVE OPTION AT SEC. KIM POINTED OUT EARLIER TO MAKE IT DOWN IN THE CURRENT SO WELL THERE'S A OF TALK NOW AT THE MOMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER WE NEED EVOLUTION VERSUS INCREMENTAL CHANGE AND THAT'S POLITICAL DIALOGUE WERE IN. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE ARE LOW THING IN. THAT'S SOMETHING WE ANNOUNCED TO EVOLUTION HOPE IT HAPPENS IN A PAIN WAY IS DONE IN A WAY WHERE JAMBOREE. REACH READ THE CAN IS TO OFTEN THE BLOW FOR THOSE FOR WHOM WOULD BE A BIRD. BUT. SECRETARY KIM TALKED ABOUT THE DO SCOPING PLAN THAN A RB IS WORKING ON ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO GRAPPLE WITH THESE ISSUES AND BEING. A STATE THAT HAS A VERY ROBUST- CONSTITUENCY AROUND ALL TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IT MEANS THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS BY OURSELVES- OFF IN A IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AT BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AND LARGE CITIES AND SMALL AND TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY. MAKE PROGRESS WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN DO THIS- BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE PAST- BUT- WE DO FACE SOME OBSTACLES ONE OF WHICH OF COURSE IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CURRENT EFFORTS TO TAKE AWAY OUR AUTHORITY- AS A STATE TO- TO REQUIRE. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND TO TAKE A POSITION THAT THE STATE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH. DILIGENTLY IN THE COURTS AND WITH THE AGENCIES TO TRY TO CHANGE THAT POSITION BUT THIS IS STILL- STILL AN ONGOING. STRUGGLE SO- I WANTED JUST- FLIP AHEAD HERE A LITTLE BIT TO TALK ABOUT LIGHT DUTY VERSUS HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES BECAUSE- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES MOST PEOPLE I THINK PICTURE- YOU KNOW A LEAF FOR TESLA MAYBE OR SOMETHING. THAT IS AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION TO PURCHASE AND WE ARE VERY ENGAGED IN THAT- IN THAT PROGRAM IN TERMS OF TRYING TO EXPAND THE OPTIONS AND THE CHOICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND TO MAKE OF VEHICLES AVAILABLE AND ALL DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS AND- AT PRICES THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD HEY. WE HAVE USED THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT AS A WAY TO PROVIDE REPEAT STEP. SERVERS AS A BRINGING DOWN THE CALL. WE HAVE ANOTHER. THAT SEEKS. ADEQUATE CONSIDER. BY BRINGING UP THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT AT- A PERSON WHO HAS A CAR THAT FAILS THE SMOG CHECK TEST CAN GET TO PURCHASE A NEWER CLEANER CAR. SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THAT SPACE AND IT'S MEANT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME THE- EPICENTER FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THE COUNTRY WITH MORE- MORE PASSENGER VEHICLES HERE THAN ANY PLACE ELSE AND IN FACT MORE THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AB COMBINED BUT IT'S STLL ONLY DEALS WITH ABOUT HALF THE PROBLEM IF YOU- FLIP THE HEAD TO- THE TENTH PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. YOU CAN SEE THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES MAKE UP 20% OF TRANSPORTATION RELATED J. M. AND OF LARGEST. OF KNOX EMISSIONS WITHIN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THAT 43% SO IN ORDER TO MEET BOTH THE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AND PARTICULARLY TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF POLLUTION IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE CENTERED AROUND FOR. RAIL YARDS TRANSPORTATION HUBS. CENTERS LIKE THE WAREHOUSES- THAT WE HAVE IN THE EASTERN AND THE LA BASIN. WE HAVE TO TAKE A BROADER APPROACH TO ACCELERATING A LARGE SCALE TRANSITION OF ZERO EMISSION MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND WE'RE DOING THIS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADVANCED CLEAN TRUCK REGULATION THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AT THE MOMENT BUT IT'S INTENDED TO ACCELERATE A LARGE SCALE TRANSITION. OF ZERO EMISSION MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES BOTH THROUGH A SALES REQUIREMENT OF FOR THE MANUFACTURERS AND A REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR- PURCHASERS FOR FLEET PURCHASERS IN PARTICULAR AND WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN BOLSTER THIS. WHOLE AREA AS WELL RECOGNIZING THIS COMPLICATED IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY THAT WE DO THIS RIGHT BUT WITHOUT SENDING SOME PRETTY- STOFF LONG TERM GOALS AND COMING UP WITH METHODS TO PUSH PEOPLE IN THAT DIRECTION I DON'T THINK WE CAN JUST COUNT ON NATURAL ATTRITION TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO. ANYTIME SOON SEC. WE'RE TRYING TO ANSWER PROJECTS IN THE HEAVY DUTY AND FREIGHT SPACE AS WELL WE HAVE HAD PROGRAMS IN EFFECT DOWN FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW TO FUND THE PRE COMMERCIAL DEMONSTRATION PHASE PILOTS EARLY COMMERCIALIZATION WHICH CAN HELP WITH THE COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENT. AND MARKET SCALE ADOPTION OF CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND FREIGHT EQUIPMENT. BUT AGAIN INSTEAD OF. IN SUPPORT FOR COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO FACE OPPOSITION THERE AS WELL AND SO WE ARE TRYING HARD WORKING OUT WITH AGENCIES WITH THE INDUSTRY WHICH WANTS TO SEE A NATIONAL APPROACH HERE. FIVE TO GET OUT OF PROGRAM WHICH WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR US AND FOR OTHER STATES THAT FACE SOME SOME SIMILAR CONCERNS. ATTAINING THE FEDERAL OZONE STANDARD IN THE SOUTH COAST LA ORANGE RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO AREA- IS GOING TO- REQUIRE A BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. TO MEET THE OZONE STANDARD AND THAT'S AN EX BEEN EXTENDED OUT MANY YEARS INTO THE FUTURE FROM WHERE IT WAS ORIGINALLY SET TO BE. AND 72% REDUCTION BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE TO MEET THE EIGHT HOUR OZONE STANDARD. ABSENT ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY KNOCKS EMISSIONS FROM THE FEDERALLY REGULATED SOURCES WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DIRECTLY CONTROL WHICH INCLUDE THE INTERSTATE TRUCKS PLANES TRAINS AND SHIPS WILL EXCEED THE EMISSIONS FROM ALL OF THE SOURCES THAT CAR. DOES ACTUALLY REGULATE SO OUR THIRTY IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ON LIMITED HERE BUT WE ARE STILL TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM PHRASE WORKING OTHER WITH A POOR. ON OUT BIRTH REGGAE. ENGINES THEMSELVES BUT WE CAN WORK WITH THE PORTS AND THE- AND THE OWNERS OF THE OF THE- BIRTH THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THE SHIPS CALL THEY ARE SWITCHING TO ELECTRICITY- WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO ELECTRIFY TRANSPORT REFRIGERATION UNITS- TO POWER THE THAT POWER THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS ON TRUCKS AND- SHIPPING CONTAINERS. AND OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE PLAN TO ALSO PROPOSE REGULATIONS FOR ZERO EMISSION CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS ON ROAD DRAINAGE TRACKS. ALL OF WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING CARGO THROUGH PORTS AND RAIL YARDS SO WITH ALL OF THESE- MOVEMENTS A FOOT AND A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENTS GOING ON IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES HERE. I NEED TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A SYSTEM APPROACH HERE THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT A TRUCK OR A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A ROBUST FEELING INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK AS WELL AS REPAIRS AND OTHER ASSOCIATED FACILITIES. THAT WORK WITH THE IS AB VEHICLES AND SO OTHER AGENCIES INCLUDING THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE CPC ARE BOTH INVOLVED AND WORKING HARD ON THAT TASK AND WE CONSIDER THEM ESSENTIAL PARTNERS IN THIS IN THIS EFFORT. BUT WITH ALL THAT WE CAN DO ON TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE SYSTEM WE ARE GOING TO HAVE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES WITH US FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. AND THAT MEANS THOSE VEHICLES ARE NOT ONLY GONNA NEED TO HAVE- THE FUEL CONTINUALLY SUPPLIED BUT HOPEFULLY GETTING CLEANER AND LESS- CO TWO- INTENSIVE- WE ALSO NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ACTUALLY. REDUCE THE NEED TO USE THOSE THOSE VEHICLES AND AGAIN THIS IS ONE WHERE. A ARE B. HAS AUTHORITY AS SOME PIECE OF WHAT HAS TO BE DONE- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE WAYS ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TODAY- WE'VE SEEN SOME ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND AGAIN NOT JUST ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RP BUT- WORKING WITH- PR WE- CHANGE THE DEFINITION THAT'S USED IN C. CA. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PROJECT AND YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECTIVE IT'S GOING TO BE ON TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS WE DON'T JUST LOOK AT THE OLD- METRIC OF LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT IMPLIED THAT JUST GETTING PLACES. GETTING PEOPLE FROM PLACE TO PLACE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THROUGH AN INTERSECTION WAS GOING TO BE THE ONLY. METRIC THAT WE WERE GONNA DO AS WE NOW LOOK AT. THE M. T. AS AN E. A MORE EASILY TRANSLATE A BULL- MEASUREMENT AND THAT IN TURN HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR. WHAT ALTERNATIVES WE MIGHT WANT TO BE LOOKING AT WHEN IT COMES TO NEW PROPOSED LAND USE PROJECTS- REDUCING THE NEED TO DRIVE AS SECRETARY SAID INCLUDES A LOT OF OTHER. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT IN ALTERNATE IS AND IT HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFORT TIONS. COMMUNITIES SERVED. GET DEAL WITH RELATED ISSUES CONGESTION AND LONGER COMMITTEE TIMES WE RECENTLY HAVE FORTIFIED OUR WORK ON SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE TO TRY TO STRENGTHEN THE LONG TERM GOALS THERE. IN THE HOPE THAT THAT WILL ALSO BE AN INCENTIVE FOR COMMUNITIES TO LOOK MORE SERIOUSLY AT PROJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT JUST INCREASED CAPACITY FOR. VEHICLES BUT DON'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO HELP WITH THIS TRANSITION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEWS DATEABLE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROJECT. AS PART OF OUR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROJECT WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING EQUITY IN DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. BY GRANTS TO DO MORE LOCALIZED PLANNING AND CAPACITY BUILDING ON THE PART OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS- WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES OVERLAPPED WITH OTHER AGENCIES THAT WERE TRYING TO. BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND WE SHARE THE THAT LOOK JUST HAS TO PASSED BILLS IN THIS AREA INCLUDING AB ONE EIGHTY FIVE LAST YEAR WHICH ADDED THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AGENCY TO THEM MANDATED MEETINGS BETWEEN CARBON THE CTC JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE WHERE JUST HAVING TO GET TOGETHER SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR AND HAVE A JOINT AGENDA AND ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER. DAS LIED TO INCREASED AWARENESS AND HOPE PLEASE AT LEAST. AB RATE PROGRAM SO WITH ALL OF OUR- I THINK AS WE LIKE TO CAN TO PLAY A ROLE IN. CREATING SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND BEING THE- BEING THE SOURCE OF ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ACTUALLY DO FOR AIR QUALITY- AND FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WHICH AFFECTS US ALL AND- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE I THINK STRONGER AND MORE HOLISTIC- INVESTMENTS IN THE SUSTAINABLE. COMMUNITIES AND PLANNING AREA IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INTEGRATING OUR HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS- ALONG WITH OUR GOALS FOR AIR QUALITY IN CLIMATE IN WAYS THAT ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE'VE THAT WE ALL. SUBSCRIBE TO AND THAT. YOU AND TO THE GOVERNOR HAVE AT CONTINUE TO REINFORCE- IN TERMS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS AND FACILITATING A TRANSITION AWAY FROM OF PETROLEUM BASED ECONOMY AND ONE THAT IS- CAPABLE OF BEING RESILIENT TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S ALREADY UNDER WAY. THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU AND- LET ME ASK YOU QUESTIONS AND I'D LOVE TO OPEN IT UP- AND OTHERS CAN BE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS BUT I SUPPOSE. I'M I MENTION TONS OF GREAT THINGS I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE FOR EXAMPLE MAY HOW HOW WE MOVE THAT BEYOND A GOOD FIGHT DISCUSSION- YOU KNOW WE MAY BE PLANNING BEEN HAVING CHATS ABOUT HOW TO BEST IMPLEMENT BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WITH SB THIRTY THREE SEVEN FIVE IS THAT. IT DOESN'T AUTUMN AND WE HAVE ENOUGH TEETH- YOU KNOW ARE WE WE'RE NOT FINDING WHEN I BUILDING THOSE PROJECTS. HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE THAT CONVERSATION INTO SOMETHING IT'S MORE TANGIBLE. WELL AS AS I'M SURE THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS VERY WELL ANY DISCUSSIONS THAT INVOLVE- WHAT SEEN AS INTERFERING WITH LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS. MEET WITH- PRETTY STRONG RESISTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE- LOCAL LAND USE AGENCIES AND EVEN WITH THE OVER RIDING STATE GOALS HAS BEEN VERY HARD. FOR US TO. DO A LOT ESPECIALLY. WHEN THERE AREN'T A LOT OF CARROTS- BUT CERTAINLY NOT MUCH WITH STICKS- THE PARENT WITH SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. EXPEDITED REVIEW AND BASICALLY ELIMINATING THE OBSTACLE OF HAVING TO LOOK AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS. IMPACTS OF PROJECTS THAT TRIGGERED SEE CA THAT WAS WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO. BE THE- THING THAT GOT LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WILLING TO ACCEPT- PLEASE MORE STRICT AND RIVER COMMENCED. LOOKING AT G. H. T. OR REALLY VMT RELATED OUR GUEST. AN A. R. P.'S ROLE IN THAT WAS LIMITED TO HAVING THE TARGETS WHICH WE DID AND- WITH. THE MPO. AND THEN TO. OKAY AT THE ANTHEM SO THAT WERE DEVELOPED AND SAY WHY THEY MET THOSE TARGET AND YOU KNOW THE- THERE'S A LOT OF- A LOT OF ROOM FOR- VEGA DONE US OR INTERPRETATION IN THESE KINDS OF- OF EXERCISES AND WHERE IT GETS TO BE REALLY INTENSE AS WHEN. YOU'VE GOT A SPECIFIC PROJECT UNDER WAY I SUDDENLY OPPONENTS AND PROPONENTS ARE ALL GATHERED AROUND YOU KNOW EAGERLY TRYING TO USE THE- PROCESS- AS A WAY TO ATTACK- OR SUPPORT OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW THE PROJECT IS I'VE BEEN. PERSONALLY WATCHING THE EVOLUTION OF SOME OF OUR EFFORTS- TO LOOK AT STADIUM PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE RECENTLY AND SEEING HOW- A SUBSTANTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT A GIVEN PROJECT AND MAKE A FINDING THAT IT WILL NOT- EVER HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON AG EMISSIONS IN THE FUTURE I MEAN WE DO IT BECAUSE- WE'RE REQUIRED TO AND WE GO THROUGH AN EXERCISE AND- YOU KNOW WE FOUND WAYS. TO CONVINCED THE DEVELOPERS IN THESE CASES THERE YOU KNOW LARGE AND WELL HEELED ENTITIES AND SO IT'S RELATIVELY EASY COMPARED TO SOME SITUATIONS TO GET PEOPLE TO AGREE TO PUT IN A LECTURE CHARGING AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSES AND- BUT- ABSENCE OF A MORE INTEGRATED APPROACH. THAT THE COMMUNITIES BY INTO AND THAT- THE AGENCIES ARE ALL A PART OF ITS IT FEELS SOMETIMES LIKE AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S A DESPERATE NEED TO THESE. PROJECTS IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD THEM AND SUPPORT THEM. AND. COMMUNITIES GENERALLY AT LEAST. IT IF IT. IN THIS KIND OF CRAP. AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE GOING TO BE A- BY THE ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC OR- FEEL LIKE IT'S GONNA YOU KNOW. HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEIR- QUALITYOF LIFE ARE FIERCELY OPPOSED AND YOU FIND YOURSELF HAVING THIS BATTLE BEING FOUGHT OVER GREENHOUSE GASES AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER THIS IS ACTUALLY A YOU KNOW A GOOD A GOOD THING TO BE DOING ARE NOT. ALL I'M SAYING ABOUT THAT IS THAT I THINK WE NEED A BROADER BASED PLANNING APPROACH- TO THROUGH TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT FOR A LONG TIME BUT I CAN WHAT'S ABOUT. BEING THOUGHTFUL AND BUT THE MADE WITH YOU THERE'S LEAN CERTIFICATION AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE APPROVING ANYMORE MAJOR STADIUM PROJECTS ABOUT IN YOUR RAIL AND IT. COMPONENT TO EVERY PROJECT THAT HAS TO BE A GIVEN I THINK AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE WAY. OVER AND SEVERAL YEAR AND I IT WAS A MISSED AND I WE NEED TO. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING OUT IT AND MASSIVE FROM TRANSIT SYSTEM IN LA. I'LL GET THE LYMPICS COMING UP IT'S THE LARGEST TRANSPORTATION IS LARGEST TRANSIT. BUILD OUT IN THE NATION RIGHT NOW AND- I ANOTHER ELECTION ISN'T IT TO TRY TO CREATE A REAL SPUR- TO THE STADIUM. AND SO YEAH FOR ANYHOW- LOOK AT ONE OF THE QUIT WHY WHEN ASKED ABOUT ABOUT AVIATION YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS IS ENORMOUS AREA OF EMISSIONS AND- I KNOW. IT SEEMS THAT WE JUST. WE JUST SAY WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY ROLL OVER ANY EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUT OF STATE TRAVEL AND IS THAT A TERRIBLY TRUE AND CAN WE DO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE GIVEN ALL THE EXCITING THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH SHORT LEGS ELECTRIFICATION AND BIO FUEL OPPORTUNITIES THE AVIATION SECTOR. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WE DON'T GET TO SET AN EMISSIONS STANDARD FOR AIRPLANES THE WAY WE DEAL WITH- CARS OR- BANDS AND SO FORTH BUT- WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THIS SPACE BOTH IN ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING- TRANSITION TO CLEANER AVIATION FEELS. AND ALSO- WE'RE SEE I'M SOME REALLY EXCITING WORK GOING ON- MOSTLY FILL IN THE PRE COMMERCIAL SPACE BUT SOME OF IT MOVING TOWARDS COMMERCIALIZATION FOR SHORT HAUL AVIATION TO BE ZERO EMISSION- AIRCRAFT THERE ACTUALLY ARE NOW WORKING DEMONSTRATIONS OF AIRPLANES THAT COULD TO DO A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE- SMALL BOWL- TRIPS THE SHORT HOPS THAT VIEWS. ARE USED FOR DELIVERY PACKAGES MAIL ETCETERA- IN A COMPLETELY ERO EMISSION MODE THE AIRPORTS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN INTERESTED AND HAVE BEEN WORKING- PLAY ACCESS TO IS ONE. RAIMES MIGLIOR WITH DILIGENTLY FOR YOU IS THAT WITH A LOT OF PUSH FROM THE SOUTH COAST DISTRICT TO ALLOW UP TO FIVE THE THING ON BROWN'S. ITEMS USED SMOKE. YEAH I'M WHAT ABOUT I WANT ONE OF THE ONE I SEE THAT YOU YOU MADE SOME PRETTY. WE HAVE A- STRONG COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEED TO TRANSITION- AWAY FROM- INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE- IF THAT TRULY HAPPENS DOES IS THE MTS BIGGER PROBLEM. MOVING FORWARD. HI IN THE IDEA BEING THAT DATE RIGHT NOW WE ASSOCIATE VMT SO MUCH WITH THE MISSIONS BECAUSE WE WERE DOING AND WE'RE DOING SO ON THE BASIS OF THINKING ABOUT A CAR AS A- AS A HEAVY POLLUTER- BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY TRANSCEND TRANSITIONED OF THE OUR AUTOMOBILE AND TRUCK FLEET. TOWARD LOWING LOWER POLLUTING VEHICLES IS MUTE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED SPEAK A PROBLEM. OF IT AS- AT OF SUGGESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING IN A DIFFERENT WAY AT A CLEAN MILE STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH VEHICLES ARE BEING USE. THAT MIGHT BEA METRIC THAT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HAS EVEN A VERY CLEAN VEHICLE BUT IT'S BEING USED. MOST OF THE DAY TO ADD IN SOME INSTANCES IN AN AUTONOMOUS FASHION WHEN IT ISN'T EVEN. CARRYING ANYBODY OR ANYTHING- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. THE OVERALL IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FOR TRAFFIC FURTHER ROADS THE- SAFETY THESE AREA. THE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT IT'S A BIG PROBLEM YET TRAFFIC CONGESTION PERSPECTIVE YEAH SO FROM A FOR A RARE. PERSPECTIVE IF IT'S REALLY BEING READ. THIS IS. EMISSIONS AND FUEL MEANING THE OTHER. IS ALL RENEWABLE YOU CAN GET PRETTY CLOSE TO A ZERO- A ZERO EMISSIONS MODEL AND- I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT. OF THAT ESPECIALLY IN URBAN AREAS YEAH. WE WENT WITH IN MIND I KNOW OF THE PRICE YOU PRICE A LITTLE MADE A BRIEF ALLUSION I KNOW A CONTRA TOPIC BUT I THINK IT IMPORTANT SUSPENSE MORE TIME LOOKING AT- I WAS AT A PRESENTATION THIS LAST WEEKEND FROM A PROFESSOR DOWN A USC PROFESSOR BARNETT WHO. TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW. PARKING SCARCITY IN PRICING I KNOW THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CONGESTION. PRICING SOMEONE WHO. SOME MODELS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN EUROPE WHERE. WHERE WE- ON ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE MISTER SECRETARY. PRICES A HUGELY IMPORTANT STRATEGY IN AS YOU POINTED OUT CHAIRMAN ALAN IT IS CONTROVERSIAL IT IS SENSITIVE. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS IF WE'RE GONNA GET SERIOUS ABOUT REDUCING VMT REDUCING. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND- URGING GREATER MOTIONS AND SO I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED THAT UP. ORDER PRICING IS BEING EXPORTED LA BY- WEST OF WEST LA BY ONLY METRO SKAGGS OF THE BAY AREA IS DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR I BELIEVE RUN TREASURE ISLAND. AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS WE NEED TO HAVE. AND SO AT THE STATE LEVEL- WORK FOR GAEA AND WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS OF. PROFESSOR BARNETT I KNOW HIM WELL- WHEN THE LEADING EXPERTS WHEN IT COMES TO PRICING. AND WHEN IT COMES TO PARKING PRICING DYNAMIC PRICING CORDON PRICING YOU CONGESTION PRICING THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO THIS- IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE. AND ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WHICH IS OUR- OKAY AND THEN I WANT TO ASK YOU SB SECRETARY- WE TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO. REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS. BUT THERE'S ALSO THE FACT THAT THE CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE. MARK ON AN- IMPACT OUR SYSTEM IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE REGARDLESS OF THE WORK WE DO- I'VE I WANTED TO RAISE A CONCERN ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY STATE ENGINEERS AS ROADS AND HIGHWAYS ARE BEING. PLANNEDAND BUILT AND- CAN YOU GIVE US AN UNDERSTANDING AS TO AS TO. WHAT TO WHAT EXTENT OUR PLANNERS IN OUR ENGINEERS ARE INCORPORATING. BEST THE BEST POSSIBLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ABOUT HAD THE GROWING IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AS ARE MAKING PLANS ABOUT I'D WITH THE REST OF BUILDING BRIDGES AND ROADS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. CALTRANS HAS LAUNCHED A SERIES OF- CLIMATE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS IN EACH OF THE TWELVE CALTRANS DISTRICTS SO THEY ARE- GOING ALL OUT TO REALLY BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE TO WHICH- OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE IS IMPACTED BY SEA LEVEL RISE ANOTHER. EXAMPLES OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO WE'VE GOT OUT THAT'S A GOOD BASELINE OF INFORMATION AND WE CAN BUILD ON THAT IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE BUILD RESILIENCY INTO PROJECTS. EXAMPLE IS INTERNAL WHITE HOUSE USER IS HIGHWAY% THIRTY SEVEN- WHICH IS- SURROUNDS IN AND SURROUNDS THE BAY AND WE'RE SEEING IMPACTS OF THAT AND THEY'RE OLD WE NEED TO BE A LONG TERM SOLUTION- IN THE FORM OF EITHER RAIING. THE ROADWAY FOR MOVING AWAY SO HUGE AND CENTERED ON SORRY SENATOR DODGE AREA YES- AND SO THAT'S A GOOD THAT' A IT'S ALMOST LIKE A POSTER CHILD FOR ON THE IMPACT O CLIMATE CHANGE ON ON THE TRANSPORTATION OF SOLD EITHER OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL BUT- THE TO THE TO CLASSIC. OKAY SHOULD THE ARBOR THE STEAM TRANSPORTATION. IF YOU TOOK A HISTORICALLY- OF WHAT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVEDONE IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW FINANCING TRANSPORTATION OF WE COULD START WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE- SO WAS THE LAST TIME THEY RAISED- ANY KIND OF REVENUE INCREASES FOR TRANSPORTATION. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND- BECAUSE THE GAS TAX IS A PER GALLON TAX- IT DOESN'T RESPOND TO INFLATION SO IT WE LOST THE- OVER TIME- BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DUE TO. THE INFLATION FROM THE FEDERAL SHARE OF- TRANSPORTATION THERE THE STATE SO. OF INCREASE THE GASOLINE TAX IN NINETY TWO AND THEN THE SP ONE. AND WE ALSO INCREASED A VEHICLE MADE HIS FEE AND THE DIESEL FUEL TAX DIESEL FUEL TAX WENT TO TRANSIT. THE FUNDING SOME OF THE TRANSIT PROGRAMS. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF PAST- SO- SALES TAX INCREASES. OF SOME COUNTIES HAVE SUCCEEDED SOME HAVE NOT. IN OTHER COUNTIES THE- THEY TRIED OF IT BUT IT REQUIRES OF COURSE A TWO THIRDS VOTE- AND SO WE HAVE SOME WINNERS AND LOSERS THERE IN TERMS OF FUNDING- THE STATE ALSO DID BONDING IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR TRANSIT TRANSPORTATION BOND AND- FOR BILLION AND HOUSING IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR BILL FOR OUSTING. SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FUNDING. TRANSPORTATION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IF YOU DEVELOP A PLAN ARE YOU. IF YOU DEVELOP A PLAN DON'T TRY TO COME UP WITH A WAY OF FINDING IT I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE. I THINK I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN THAT ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING OR OTHER AND GATHERS DUST ON. THE ACADEMICS BOOKSHELVES SO. WOULD YOU CONSIDER WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS WE HAVE FOR. FUNDING TRANSPORTATION THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE- GOALS WE HAVE FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS COULD YOU COULD YOU CONSIDER BONDING BANZER INTEREST RATES RIGHT NOW IS PRETTY GOOD. OF IF YOU BUILD THE PROJECTS IN LOS ANGELES FOR THE OLYMPICS AND THE BARD TO SAN JOSE AND OTHER PROJECTS QUICKER WITH BINDING- YOU ACHIEVE. DECADES WORDS OF ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN TERMS OF GETTING THE PROJECTS DONE FASTER THE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS ALREADY READY TO GO THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD THEIR TRYING TO FINANCE THEM AND BUILD THEM IN PHASES BUT STILL BUILDING PHASES THEY CAN BUILD THE WHOLE PROJECT IN ACHIEVE- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOLD A LOT QUICKER IF YOU CAN BUILD THEM FASTER SO. WHAT KIND OF WHAT KIND OF. WHAT KIND OF FINANCING- WITH THE STATE COME UP WITH IF YOU DEVELOP YOUR TRANSPORTATION AIR QUALITY PLANNING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. FOR A CLOSER LOOK AT OUR MONEY OF COURSE AS GOOD AS THE COURSE. GERMAN BILL ALL THE OPTIONS YOU YOU OUT ONE HAVE TO BE ON THE TABLE- AND AS WE AS YOU POINTED OUT AS WE DISCUSS THE LAST TIME MOST BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE. SB ONE. A MAGNIFICENT ACCOMPLISHMENT. IT DOES NOT MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF THE STATE WHEN IT COMES TRANSPORTATION- THE US DEPARTMENT TRAVELS DAILY FOR. BACKLOG OF REPAIRS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FOR. DECADES CORRECT THAT'S AND- THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION EVERY YEARPUTS OUT A REPORT CALLED THE ANNUAL CONDITIONS AND PERFORMANCE REPORT WHICH LOOKS OUT. WHAT IT WOULD COST TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM BOTH HIGHWAYS AND TRANSIT. AND WHAT WOULD IT COST TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM THERE IS NOT ENOUGH NOT ENOUGH MONEY. TO MAINTAIN. LET ALONE IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE- NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA'S NATIONWIDE ABOUT YOUR CALIFORNIA ALL THE OPTIONS HAVE TO BE ON THE TABLE INCLUDING- PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. NOW THAT IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR PUBLIC FUND FUNDING- THREES WORK IN SOME SINCE THE TUITIONS BUT NOT EVERYWHERE- AND SO ALL THOSE ALL THOSE OPTIONS MUST BE ON THE TABLE. IF THE FOR MY BILLING- METRO. IN LOS ANGELES. AND I END UP BECAUSE OF LACK OF FINANCE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE PLAN AND- THE PLANS BEEN APPROVED ALL THE DOCUMENTS. WITH THE FIND EVER BART TO SAN JOSE OR CALTRAIN OR JUST NAME ANY OF THESE TRANSIT PROJECTS ARE ALL IT'S ALL THE SAME OKAY IS NO DIFFERENT REALLY BUT YOUR BILL IT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS BECAUSE THEY'RE MOSTLY MOSTLY LOCALLY FUNDED. THEY'RE BUILDING I'M IN PHASES. THE BUILDING AND PIECES. AND BUILDING THINGS IN PIECES. DOESN'T ACHIEVE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION BECAUSE YOU GOTTA HAVE YOU GOTTA HAVE TRANSIT THE GOES FROM POINT A TO POINT B. COMPLETED RATHER THAN LITTLE. PIECES ALONG THE WAY LIKE GOING DOWN WILSHIRE BOULEVARD- GOING GOING THROUGH THE LOS ANGELES METRO GETTING TO THE AIRPORT- OF ALL THE ALL THE ROOM THE LINES THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD AND SAN DIEGO AND- AND- EXTENSION OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION. IN TO- MEANT FOR OR- WE SHOULD NOT WE SHOULD LOOK AT FINANCING THESE THINGS BECAUSE OF WE GET OF GET IT DONE QUICKER. THE DIVIDEND IS MORE TONS OF POLLUTANTS OUT OF THERE RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU GET YOU GET BETTER GET BETTER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IF YOU FINANCE THINGS LIKE THAT AND GET HIM BUILT OSCAR. EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT BE PAYING HIM OFF OVER TIME YOU'RE STILL GETTING A DIVIDEND THAT EXCEEDS THE INTEREST COST. IS WHAT I'M SAYING YOU KNOW AND- PROBABLY THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS LOST. SO IS THERE IS IT DO YOU HAVE SOME SCHEMES THAT ARE BEING WORKED OUT. TO PROPOSE. SOME FINANCING FOR SOME OF THE TRANSIT TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. I THINK YOU CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THE FACT THE REALITY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSIT EXTENSIONS WEATHERBY BARGE SAN JOSE OR THE LA NATURAL PURPLE LINE EXTENSION. THOSE ARE BEING DONE IN PHASES BECAUSE THAT THE READ THE FUNDING FOR PULLING OUT A COUPLE ON. THE REALITY OF FUNDING THE WAY THESE FUNDING PROGRAMS WORK ESPECIALLY THE FEDERAL LEVEL DOES NOT ALLOW. IN TIRED EXTENSION TO BE BUILT IN ONE FELL SWOOP AND UNTIL THERE IS WHOLESALE CHANGE ESPECIALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF HOW. TRANSIT PROJECTS AND SYSTEMS ARE OFF. FOR IT'S GOING TO BE THAT MEAL UP. THAT SIMPLY THE WAY THIS IS SET UP SPECIAL THE FEDERAL. AND DELETED DURABILITY BE A CHANGE ON THAT NOW THIS THE TRIGGER THAT'S MY NEXT QUESTION THE FEDERAL- THE FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN RELEASED BY THE HOUSE INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE THE FRAMEWORKS IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S OVER ORIENTED TOWARDS REDUCING. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS I LOOK AT YOU LOOKED IT AND MY CORRECTED TO. THE NEW FRAMEWORK PRESENTED I THINK IS ONE BY THE SENATE ALSO. OF THE SENATE HAS PRODUCED A DOCUMENT AS WELL FOR THE FIRST. THING AT THE FOR THE GOING TO TRY TO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS OR WHATEVER. TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME FINANCING OF INFRASTRUCTURE- WITH THIS DOCTOR WITH THIS DOCUMENT- FIT IN WITH OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. PLANNING AND- AND THE GOVERNOR'S INTENTION TO HAVE A- A TRANSPORTATION ACTION A TRANSPLANTED ACTION. PLAN THAT WE NEED TO FINANCE WITH THAT WOULD THAT BE. SOMETHING YOU THINK IS COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. AND HOW CAN WE HELP THEM GET THAT ARE APPROVED. YET YES ABSOLUTELY GOVERNOR GO OUT AND START. YOU KNOW BROWSE THE TROOPS SERGEI YOU MIGHT SAY THE- HELP US GET THIS. BECAUSE THEY NEVER YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE. THIS SHOULD BE A KEY ISSUE IN THIS SPECIALLY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RIGHT. RIGHT OUT OF FUND INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS POLLUTION YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STUFF. ABSOLUTELY AS WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME THE HOUSE YOU KNOW I COMMITTEE CAME OUT WITH A FRAMEWORK THAT IS. REALLY PROMISING- SO I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LANGUAGE ON RESERVE RESILIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FACT THAT IT INCREASES FUNDING FOR ALMOST A% TRANSPORTATION INCLUDING RAIL. TRANSIT INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL YOU NAME IT- THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE IN THE IN THE TEEN ARE FREE WORK. THE PERENNIAL QUESTION ALWAYS BEFORE CONGRESS IS HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT. THERE IS NO POLITICAL CENTERS ON HOW YOU DO THAT WHETHER IT'S INDEXING THE GAS TAX RAISING THE GAS TAX- OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM. THAT IS WHAT'S HOLDING BACK- SWIFT ACTION ON A CONGRESSIONAL REAUTHORIZATION THE FAST ACT- I WAS IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK WE MADE THE ROUNDS WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION. WE ALSO KNOW WHICH SHERMAN PETER DEFAZIO THE HOW CAN I COMMITTEE BECAUSE YOU AND- AND MENTIONED- OUR OUR VIEWS ON HIS FRAMEWORK AND WE SAID WE SAID GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT IT'S- IT'S FOR PROMISING. UP AND ONLY LIKE TO BE ONE. YES IN. THE GAS TO. IT HAS BEEN ONE IN THE- RESET WE GOTTA DO THE FEDERAL. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I WOULD HELP A LOT. SO ON THE ONE HAND IT'S VERY PROMISING TO SEE WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THE HOUSE AND THE U. S. SENATE. ON THE OTHER HAND UNTIL THEY COME TO A CONSENSUS ON HOW TO PAY FOR IT- THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. THANK YOU- MEMBERS. START SORRY I DON'T MEAN TO RUSH BUT I. AND I HAVE TO I HAVE TO JUMP I JUST WANTED. MAKE A FINER POINT ON CHAIRMAN BILLS CRITICAL. EMPHASIS HOW SHORT ARE WE LETTING THEM YES IS DIFFERENT HOW MUCH MONEY WILL COST TO ACHIEVE OUR TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS SCHOOLS LIKE IF WE WERE ACTUALLY TO. MEET. OUR OBJECTIVES HOW HOW SHORT OR WE RIGHT. I'M SURE WE CAN DO SO BALCONY OF THE- CALCULATIONS WITH THE HELP OF SOME ACADEMIC EXPERTS BUT IF I GET BACK TO YOU WE ARE SHORT THERE'S NO QUESTION. LET ME KNOW WHEN I WAS LOOKING A RODENT REPAIRED JUST BACKLOG THERE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY REDUCING EMISSIONS AT ALL I THINK WE'RE SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION IT SHORT- BASED ON. THERE'S A RAND STUDY THAT'S JUST ON THAT SIDE A THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA FIFTY EIGHT BILLION OFF SB ONE JUST TO DO THAT SO THEN. THAT'S JUST MAINTAINING THE EXISTING SYSTEM. YOU CAN ARGUE ACTUALLY DOESN'T. DO ANYTHING MUCH TO HELP. BUT ARE WE TALKING THAT ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ARE WE TALKING LIKE IN A HUNDRED BILLION RANGE ARE WE TALKING IN THE FIVE BILLION RANGE I KNOW SOME OF IT IS STICKS TO SO I. IT'S A QUESTION THAT IS A FLUID. IT YOU KNOW ORIENTATION AND THAT WAY RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU HAVE STRICTER YELL VMT OR HOUSING POLICY OR IF YOU POLLED TURN THIS LEVER HERE ON THE VEHICLE SIDE BUT- I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. WHAT A REASONABLE SCOPE TO IT OVERALL TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS REDUCTION INVESTMENT STRATEGY LOOKS LIKE HERE'S AN EXAMPLE IN SAN DIEGO- WE'VE GOT THE DEL MAR BLUFFS WHICH IS JUST NORTH OF SAN DIEGO THE CITY OF DEL MAR. THAT IS HOME TO ONE OF THE MOST- ACTUALLY CERTIFICATE RAIL CORRIDORS ANYWHERE- IT'S HOME TO THE LOS AND CORRIDOR AMTRAK PACIFIC SURFLINER FROM SAN DIEGO TO LA TO SAN LUIS OBISPO IT ALSO CARE FREE REAL. DAHLE MORE BLUFFS IS EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT EROSION EVERY TIME THERE'S A MAJOR STORM EVENT AND THERE ARE EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO STABILIZE THOSE PLUS BUT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION. IS TO MOVE THOSE RAILROAD TRACKS AWAY FROM THE BLUFFS. THAT'S A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSITION IF YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY ALL THE PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY AND SENATOR DODD'S AREA- MANY OTHERS HIGHWAY ONE LAST TRANCE GREAT UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT COULD BE I'M JUST GUESSING BUT IT COULD BE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IT'S A LOT OF MONEY. I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD THAT- WE ARE FOCUSED HERE ADD RIGHTLY SO ON THE PIECE OF THIS INVOLVES. BE EMPTY BUT- WE STILL HAVE TO DO THE TRANSFORMATION TO. ELECTRIC ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND WE DO HAVE A ESTIMATE OF THE PRICE ON THAT WHICH IS NOT NEARLY AS SITE IS SO. GIVE US A SENSE- OF WELL THE I THINK A BETWEEN THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND- A. R. B. WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BUT- WE'VE LOOKED AT- YOU KNOW KIND OF TEN YEAR PROJECTIONS TO GET TO THE- GOALS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID AND IT'S- MORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A COUPLE OF BILLION A YEAR. OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. AND I MEAN WHEN I LOOK HERE I SEE A 5% CONTINUES APPROPRIATION FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS CHUNK. THERE IS NO LONG TERM FUNDING STREAM ON LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION WRIT LARGE EVERY YEAR IT'S UP AND DOWN AND CV ARPINO C. V. R. P. AND THERE'S A LOT OF FITS AND STARTS WHICH- IS. DEEPLY CONCERNING TO ME THAT THE MARKET HAS NO. THERE BUT I JUST I THINK THOSE NUMBERS WOULD. I KNOW THEY'LL BE INTIMIDATING WHEN YOU ALL COME BACK TO US WITH THEM- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGE. AND REALLY RIGHT SIZE OUR CONVERSATION. AND THEN SAY OKAY. WERE THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS SHORT. ARE WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE BUT MAYBE WE CAN EXECUTE. THIS IS A HAVE PIECE FOR TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OR- GO BEAT THE FOUR OH FIVE IN THE FIVE FREEWAY FOR WHATEVER THE- THE D. I'M- OF THE SURFLINER BY THE WAY. WAITING FOR THE FREIGHT. FRIENDS TO MY FOR AND GOODS MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE NEED. I LOVE THAT LINE ANY TRUST ME TO KNOW WHEN THEY GOT ME EVEN. WE CAN SEE ICE BE REAL TALKED ABOUT YET IN THIS HEARING- OR ON THE LIST OF ANY OF THE STRATEGY SO I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BUT- I GUESS EVEN SETTING THAT ASID- THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA ALONE. DWARFS THE 25% CONTINUES APPROPRIATION THAT IS GOING JUST TO HIGH SPEED RAIL NOW RIGHT I MEAN AND VERY LITTLE OF THAT IT'S COMING DOWN TO LA SO I JUST I WANT TO RIGHT SIZE THAT CONVERSATION I GUESS THE LAST QUESTION WOULD BE. IS SETTING ASIDE MAYBE THE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE FOR YOU SECRETARY CAME IN MAY BE ON THE SAFE SIDE- AND LOOK IN THAT SORT OF CARBON SPACE L. CFS HAVE YOU LOOKED AT HOW TO GET MAYBE MORE CREATIVE ABOUT THAT COMPLIANCE MARKET I KNOW THAT BILLIONS IN THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TEN BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE THAT COMES IN BUT IT COMES IN AFTER THE FACT IN A LOT OF THIS FLOWS OUT OF STATE. THEIR WAYS TO MONETIZE YOUR SECURITIZED. SOME OF THAT COMPLIANCE MARKET TO HELP AT LEAST TO THE V. INFRASTRUCTURE BETTER SO WE DON'T JUST HAVE TO LEAN ON JI JURA FOR EVER. YEAH I THINK OF THE FIRST PHASE OF OUR EFFORTS TO KIND OF- THINK MORE CREATIVELY ABOUT THAT PROGRAM- HAVE BEEN TO WORK WITH THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO TAKE SOME OF. THE VALUE THAT WENT TO THEM FOR MOVING OUT WITH ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS AS A WAY OF GAINING CREDITS. UNDER THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. AND HAVE THEM CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS A PROGRAM THAT WILL PUT. MONEY ON THE HOOD AS WE SAY OF BUYING A LECTOR VEHICLES SO GIVE THE GIVE THE DEALERS AN INCENTIVE TO BE MORE. ACTIVELY INVOLVED AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. AND THE WILL TO. DOWN COSTS UNTIL WE TO REAL PARITY. IN THE NEW CAR MARKET- BUT THE NEXT IDEA WHICH YOU'RE ALLUDING TO WHICH IS TO HOW TO FOCUS ON WHO GETS THE CREDIT SEND. GETS DONE FROM IS THE- NEXT NEXT IN LINE IN TERMS OF OUR ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU THE CHAIRS AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING TODAY. MY MIND IS ALL OVER THE PLACE I HAVE A LOT GOING ON IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. THIS HEARING IS BASICALLY. TOUCHES ON A LOT OF AREAS AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO JUST STATE FIRST YOUR APPOINTED AND THAT'S A NICE PLACE TO BE AND WE'RE ELECTED WHICH IS SOMETIMES NOT SO NICE PLACE TO BE WHEN YOU'RE HAPPEN TO GRAPPLE WITH ALL OF. OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD CONVERSATION EARLIER ABOUT. YEAH YOU KNOW STADIUMS LIKES OF WHAT WHAT HAPPENS POLITICALLY IN THIS BUILDING. BUT I WANT TO JUST KIND OF MAYBE BACK UP A LITTLE BIT AND TALK ABOUT YOUR TRANSPORTATION AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD FOR SINCE SHE SENATOR KEWL DID SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE A LONG TIME AGO AND WHEN I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE WERE LOOKING AT THOSE INSANE HOW ARE WE GOING TO COMPLY WITH THIS AND NOW. ALMOST FIFTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER WE'RE TRYING TO COPE WITH TRANSPORTATION AND WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT THREE MILLION HOME SHORTEN CALIFORNIA HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THOSE HOMES WHERE PEOPLE GONNA LIVE WHEN WE'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF LEGISLATIVE. FIXES I GUESS WE HAVE EIGHTY USE NOW THAT WE CAN PUT IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS- WHICH DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TRANSPORTATION SO WHERE I'M HEADING WITH THIS IS THAT POLITICALLY YOU KNOW WE HAD SB FIFTY HERE AND WE COULDN'T GET THE WE COULDN'T GET OUT OF HERE. IT GOT HUNG UP AND YOU KNOW WE HEARD THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN. IN THAT AREA. AGAIN THIS YEAR AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME AND I HAPPEN TO BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SIT ON BOTH THE CHAIRMAN'S COMMITTEES AND I'M REALLY SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP IN HOW WE LOOK GLOBALLY AT. OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WE REALLY MISS IN CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW THAT. THAT THE CHAIR OF THE AIRPORT WHO SAT ON THE BIODIVERSITY COUNSELED MANY YEARS BACK AND I HAPPENED TO BE. A PARTICIPATING THAT AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR WITH RC RC IF YOU RECALL- WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FIRE IN WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE PUT IN SB NINE A ONE TWO. TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW FORCE FIRE MISSIONS THAT WE- YOU KNOW. THE AND MET IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT WE MISSED THAT WE MISSED THE BOAT THERE THEN WE DON'T. TALK ABOUT THAT AS MUCH AS WE FOCUS ON. TRANSPORTATION A LOT AND IT'S A VERY HEAVY BURDEN FOR BUSINESS AND IT'S COST. PER TIME THE COST IS VERY HIGH AND THEN ON THE I WANT TO TOUCH ON THIS WHICH- I KNOW NOBODY LIKES TO HEAR IT BUT IT'S A FACT. WE HAVE THE BULLET TRAIN THAT'S BEING. SUPER SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THAT AND I I'M CONVINCED WE SHOULD CUT OFF THAT AND- LEAVE IT AND TAKE THOSE RESOURCES AND- GO DO. RAIL TRANSPORTATION. IN IN HIGH POPULATED AREAS IN THE CITIES WHERE WE CAN REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT ON GHG. SO I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. AND THEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AND I WANTED ALSO TOUCH ON. YOU KNOW. YEARS BACK WE TALKED ABOUT GOING REDUCING OUR- FOOTPRINT WITH COAL AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO NATURAL GAS. AND NOW WE WENT FROM NATURAL GAS TO BATTERIES THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT IS STORAGE IN BATTERIES IN THIS BUILDING SO I HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT TV'S I'M ACTUALLY DOING SOME LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA I DID SOME LEGISLATION THIS AREA ON. ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WHAT WE GONNA DO WITH IN THE LIFE OF BATTERIES NOBODY'S REALLY HAD THAT CONVERSATION AND WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE FOOT PRINT LOOK LIKE TO THE ENVIRONMENT WHEN WE HAVE A MILLION DVDS AND THEY'RE INTO THEIR LIFE IS THERE. SO I DID SOME LEGISLATION WERE SUPPOSED TO GET BACK SOME INFORMATION ON WHAT THE PLAN IS- GOING FORWARD. SO I WANT TO JUST. THROW THAT OUT TO YOU I ALSO WANT TO SAY. THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION WE NEED TO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD HOMES WE IT'LL BUILD. REDUCE FIELD MILES TRANCE ED THE- VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND YOU KNOW I HEARD IN YOUR COMMENTS YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW. WE NEED A REVOLUTION I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF REVOLUTION YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT- AND ALSO WE NEED TO PUSH PEOPLE TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO. AND I THINK THOSE ARE DANGEROUS AREAS IN THE IN THESE FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO PUT OUR NAME ON THE BALLOT AND- ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND I DON'T THINK. THIS IS THE POINT OF MY MESSAGE. I WANT TO BE THE TABLE WITH YOU ALL TO. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS ONE BY ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE SILENT BUT HOLISTICALLY I THINK WE- DON'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB. BUT WITH TO BRING THE PUBLIC ALONG WE HAVE NOT SPENT THEIR MONEY WISELY. I THINK WE TOO ARE NOT CREDIBLE ONE WHEN WE COME BACK AND I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COST PER TON. I THINK THERE'S BETTER WAYS WE COULD REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND I AND I SAY THAT WOULD FORCE FIRE THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD USE NATURAL GAS AS A BRIDGE UNTIL WE GET THE EEVEE STAGGERED OUT AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AS FAR STORAGE GOES I DON'T THINK REMAIN CLOSE THEIR TECHNOLOGY WISE. A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE SAYING THAT BUT THE COST TIME AND FORCING PEOPLE OUT I HAD THE MANUFACTURES OF DVDS- OURSELVES BE OTHER CAR DEALERS WHO ARE FORCED BASICALLY TO SOMEONE ON THE LOT THEY'RE NOT. WE GET ABOUT WE'RE WE'RE PUSHING THE PUBLIC IN A WAY THAT I DON'T THINK IS THERE ONE TO GO OR THEY DON'T LIKE IT AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WILL HEAD BUT I THINK THAT'S DANGEROUS I THINK THAT WE'LL GET SOME BLOWBACK. AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO IN A BETTER WAY SO I WANT TO BE THE TABLE AS WE SHOULD HAVE THE OF I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE SPENDING MR ASKING FOR MORE I MEAN. WE HEARD THAT IN THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE STUDYOR HEARING WE HAD A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE SPENDING HAVE. PROBABLY SO WITH THAT. AS ONE. THAT WE NEED MAYBE SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT HERE AND LOOK AT WAYS TO MYBE. LEGISLATORS GAY SOME OF THESE. OUT OF THE OUT OF THE HOUSE HERE- THROUGH YOUR THE HELP OF YOUR BOSS- TO PICK ACTUALLY DEUCE. SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES WE'RE NOT DOING THAT LIKE SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. SAID IF WE CAN'T GET THE TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING IN THE SAME PLACES. THANK NO I JUST WANT O POINT OUT TO THE ANNOUNCED TO THE COMMITTEE OF TRANSPORTATION THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING OUR- REVIEW OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BUSINESS PLAN ON MARCH TWENTY FOURTH OF THE DOCUMENT IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT- THE- PRESENT A- BUSINESS PLAN UNDER THE STATUTE TO. THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES EVERY TWO YEARS SO THIS PLAN WILL BE PRESENTED TO OUR COMMITTEE ON MARCH TWENTY FOURTH. WE WILL HAVE TIME TO REVIEW IT- BEFORE THEY ADOPT THE BUSINESS PLAN. WE GOT A- NIFTY BACKGROUND INFORMATION WE NORMALLY KILL SIDE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT- WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT- WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THOSE WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE CORPORATE. AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY THE CAFE STANDARDS IN AN EVIDENTLY THERE'LL BE LITIGATION THAT THERE IS LITIGATION TO DETERMINE WHAT THE MAXIMAL MAXIMUM FEASIBLE LEVEL IS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHEN I'M- INTERESTED IN IS WHOSE MAY MEANING THAT STANDARD TODAY WHAT ARE AND I GOT PLAINTIFFS DEFENDANTS DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT IN THE- THE AUTOMOBILE WORLD WHOSE MEETING THOSE. FLEET STANDARDS TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IF I COULD JUST QUICKLY- MAKE SURE THAT I'D SAY FOR THE RECORD AND MY LAWYERS WOULD BE MAD IF I DIDN'T THAT- ERROR BE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DON'T ACTUALLY REGULATE FUEL ECONOMY WE HAVE NO LEGAL AUTHORITY IN THAT AREA AT ALL. THAT'S ALL UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND THAT'S A WHERE WE COME INTO THE PICTURE IS THAT WE HAVE STANDARDS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. NOW AS IT TURNS OUT GREENHOUSE TO MEET A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STANDARD FROM A VEHICLE MANY OF THE THINGS YOU WOULD DO ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON FEEL ECONOMY SO THE TWO STANDARDS WERE DONE TOGETHER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THEN CALIFORNIA BOUGHT INTO IT. BUT WE'RE VERY CAREFUL NEVER TO SET A FUEL ECONOMY LEVEL OR SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WE ARE ONLY FOCUSING ON ON ON THE HOUSE GASSES. AND ARE. TO MEET THOSE STAND AS THEY ALSO DO SOME THINGS RELATING TO OPERATION THE VEHICLES ACTIVE ERIC THING SYSTEMS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE ONE. ACCOUNT WELL I THINK IN THE LONG RUN THAT'S THE DIRECTION ACTUALLY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE HEADED IN AS WELL BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLAINTS THAT THE CAFE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH IT WAS WELL INTENDED TO HELP SAVE PETROLEUM AND A TIME WHEN THAT WAS THE THING WE ARE MOST WORRIED ABOUT AS IT'S ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED- IT INCENTIVIZE LARGER HEAVIER VEHICLES AT THE EXPENSE OF LESS. Vì AND MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VIA. HAS OTHERS ANGEL TEACHERS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY. I'M NOT PARTICULARLY HOPEFUL TODAY IS CAP A STANDARDS. CAN THEM I IN THE IN THE TOP FOUR TIME THANK THE WAY THIS WORKS THE PEOPLE GET. AND THEN A CAN SELL BLOOM. TO OTHER MEN IF. SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE IN COMPLIANCE EITHER BY PRODUCING CARS THAT MEET THE STANDARD OR BUY CREDITS FROM OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT LIMON ATTY AND SO EVERYONE IS IN COMPLIANCE AND MOMENT. A LOT OF THE FIGHT IT'S GOING ON AT THE PRO LEVEL TO DO THE FACT THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF COMPANIES THAT ARE NOW MOVING INTO HAVING TO BUY. MOST OF THEIR CREDITS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A FLEET THAT MEETS THE STANDARDS AND THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT POSITION SO THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE STANDARDS WEAKENED. AND I GUESS THAT BRINGS US TO THIS ZEV MANDATE BECAUSE WE HAVE WE HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF VEHICLES THAT MUST BE SOLD. IN CALIFORNIA- BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE CAN YOU UPDATE THE COMMITTEES ON HOW THOSE ARE GOING BACK BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES AND THAT'S VERY. THE LARGEST BIT BUT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE ON TARGET TO MEET OUR STANDARDS GIVEN THE CURRENT. SENSE IS THAT MANDATE- WAS INTENDED TO SET A FLOOR. AND WE ARE NOW DOING OR OR BACK ON TRACK. WITH THE WITH THE MANDATE TO GET TO THE 10% THAT WAS REQUIRED UNDER THAT REGULATION. BUT AS I INDICATED IN MY TESTIMONY WE NEED A LOT MORE THAN THAT. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR AIR QUALITY AND TRANSPORTATION GOALS SO SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD JUST RAISE THE MANDATE THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND- NOT. WORRY O MUCH ABOUT INCENTIVES IN THE MARKET AND SO FORTH THAT IT HAS BEEN A CONSCIOUS DECISION ON OUR PART THAT WE WOULD DO BETTER. AND IN IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE CONSUMERS ULTIMATELY HAVE THE HOICE AS TO WHAT THEY WANT TO BUY AND WHETHER THEY WANT TO BUY A NEW CAR AND ALL. THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE AND EASY FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THE SWITCH INTO INTO THIS ALLEN MISSION WORLD. IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WE HAD. BUDGET ONE GREEN AND- DID YOU HEAR F. FOR. THAT THE- OUR GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR SPENDING THE FUNDS FOR THE- SCV OUR P. HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION AND THERE'S SOME OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS BUT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT- A REDUCTION I. AM I GUESS THE SIMPLE THINKING WOULD BE IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE A TAX CREDIT- YOU GIVE PEOPLE MONEY TO BUY SOMETHING THERE'S MORE INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO BUY IT HOW IT WHAT'S THE- THE DEPARTMENTS WERE THE AIRPORTS THINKING IF WE REDUCE THE INCENTIVE AS WE KNOW HOW DOES THAT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT UP I THINK THE BEST ANSWER TO THAT. THE POINT IS TO SAY THAT. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT NEEDS A BROADER DISCUSSION- THAT AS A AS WE WERE SAYING EARLIER THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND THE MANDATE FOR EXAMS. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S A COMBINATION THAT'S GOING TO GET US THE FOR THIS THE FASTEST MAN. OF I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO REVISIT THERE AMOUNTS THOSE PROGRAMS WE MOVE ON IN THE BUDGET. CONVERSATIONS AS WELL. AS A GUEST SUITE THE QUESTION IS THAT COSTS BECAUSE I THINK. YOU FOLKS JUST ISSUED A REPORT ON OR THE ENERGY. DEPARTMENT H. ISSUE THE REPORT ON WHAT'S THE BENEFIT HOW MANY MISSIONS ARE WE GOING TO GET REDUCE. IN BY TWENTY FORTY OR WHATEVER THE DATE IS IN AN OUR REPORTS IS NEARLY. THREE BILLION I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THREE BILLION BUT WHERE ARE WHERE THE WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM BUT- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE COST. OF THE C. V. R. P. PROGRAM WE YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE METRIC TONS WHAT IS A COSTS IS FOR THE DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND ON. ON THAT PROGRAM IS IT ECONOMICAL OR IS IT THE BEST PROGRAM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. REDUCING SECTOR SO I KNOW THE LIMITED THE CHARGE BUT I HAVE A NUMBER. I THINK IT SHOULD YOUR NUMBER OR THAT THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE. DOLLARS PER METRIC TONS. THROUGH THE C. C. R. P. PROGRAM THAT SEEMS HIGH. OF WELL FIRST OF ALL I GUESS ISHOULD SAY THAT UNDER- AB THIRTY TWO WHICH IS WHAT STARTED US DOWN THE PATH TOWARDS DOING- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAM THOSE EMISSIONS STANDARDS THAT WERE IN THE ORIGINAL POWERFULLY LEGISLATION. AB FOURTEEN NINETY THREE I BELIEVE IT WAS- REQUIRED THAT WE SAT AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STANDARDS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OVERALL AND THAT MOVED US INTO CHANGING THESE HAVE MANDATE WHICH IS REALLY ONLY FOCUSED ON CONVENTIONAL AIR POLLUTANTS INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS FOCUSED ON GREENHOUSE GASES AS WELL AND THAT BECAME KIND OF THE CORE OF THE WHOLE SCOPING PLAN THAT WE NOW HAVE AN EFFECT FOR ACHIEVING OUR CLIMATE GOALS SO- THAT PROGRAM IS SET IN THE LAWN NOW AND- IF WE WERE TO LOSE THAT. OR CHANGE IT WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO GROUND ZERO IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE MEETING OUR OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS OBJECTIVES THE MANDATE ON A RP BUT TO TRY TO DEVELOP A COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM I MEAN WE WERE REQUIRED TO DO THAT AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS A MIX OF. AYE AYE CAPTAIN PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW AND THE OF DIFFERENT. MATT ELEMENTS IN GETTING THE GREENHOUSE GAS PIPE TYPE EMISSIONS STAND. AND PUT THAT TOGETHER SO THAT THE NET OF THAT SHOULD BE A MOST. COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF ACHIEVING THE OVERALL GOAL AND WE'VE HAD THAT LOOKED AT SEVERAL TIMES BY OUTSIDE ECONOMISTS WHO HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY THOUGHT. THAT KIND OF A NAY PROUD WHICH WAS FACT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT SOME INCENTIVE SOME MANDATES DIFFERENT SECTOR APPROACH TAKEN TOGETHER MAKE SENSE OF THE EXPENSE THE COST AS- AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO GET TO THE TO GET TO THE GOAL. TO WHAT YOUR MODELING NOW ARE WHERE THEY ARE MODELING THAT USE BETWEEN D. V. PURCHASES IN THE- PRICE OF GASOLINE BECAUSE ONCE UPON A TIME YOU KNOW I'M- HAVEN'T HAVEN'T BEEN QUIET ABOUT WHERE I THINK THE PRICE OF GASOLINE SHE GO TO BUT- BUT YOU MUST HAVE SOME MODELING AT THE AIRPORT AND- TRANSPORTATION. THEY SAID YOU KNOW I GOT ELECTED IN TWENTY TEN IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME I WOULD BE BUYING GAS IN SACRAMENTO IT'S TWO DOLLARS AND NINETY CENTS A GALLON IN TWENTY TWENTY I WAS SAID NOW IT'S GOING TO BE. HAS TO BE HIGHER IN THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE HAPPY THAT SO WHAT'S YOUR MODELING NOW AND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE AIRPORT HAS ON THE- PEOPLE WHEN THE PEOPLE SWITCH OVER. IN THE MARKET BASE IF WE'RE NOT GIVING HIM AS TV E. R. P. TEN OF US. POVERTY INTEGRATED AND THEY GET THAT THERE'S A BY IN E. V. AND THEY'RE STILL. CHARGING STATE ANXIETY WHAT'S THAT PRICE MODELING THAT YOU GUYS ARE USING I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BUT THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT ARE ACTUALLY AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION. FOUND TO LOOK AT THE GASOLINE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY YEAH. THAT'S THAT'S WE WORK WITH THEM ON THAT. OKAY ON THE TWO. BUT AS I THINK ABOUT THE ACT PROGRAMS BUT- WHAT WE PROMISED THE CHAIR THAT WE GET ARE OUT HERE AT TEN THIRTY BECAUSE I KNOW SHE'S GOT OTHER COMMITMENTS- SO JOINT. CAN YOU MAKE A REQUEST HI I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO THE BUDGET SUB TO DISCUSSIONS ON. THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND IN I CAN GET OUR NEXT SPEAKER NEXT PANELIST THE- ALLEY- IN THE ALLEY- HAS INDICATED THAT THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE ON THE 40% OF THE PROCEEDS FROM CAP AND TRADE. SHOULD LIMIT. OUR EXPECTATIONS TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR A- YEAR PROCEEDS FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM SO. MISTER SECRETARY THE- LONG LIST OF PROJECTS THAT YOU HAVE SEEM TO BE GETTING LESS MONEY UNDER AT LEAST FROM THAT FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THIRTY ANTICIPATION OF THE NEXT SERIES OF YEARS IF THERE'S NOTHING DONE WITH THE WAY THAT THE OPTIONS ARE ARE YOU KNOW OPERATOR RIGHT NOW SO JUST LEAVE US WITH THAT IF THE STATUS QUO WE EXPECTING A SHRINKING BUDGET. IN AN INSTEAD OF AN EXPANDING BUT FOR ALL THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE LOVE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS REALLY DO APPRECIATE- FASTENING DISCUSSION AND I WILL SAY THAT IN MANY RESPECTS THE NEXT PRESENTATION OF THE AUDIO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS- THERE'S SOME INTERESTING CRITIQUES AND- COMMENTS AND I KNOW THAT ROSS IS GONNA BE MAKING SO. THANK YOU TO THIS PANEL AND LET'S. LET'S BRING UP BROWN SENT PRINCIPLE. FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH PHYLLIS OF ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE'LL HEAR. ROSS PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRS ARE AND MEMBERS ROSS PROBLEM AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO TODAY I'M GONNA TRY TO HIT ON JUST- THE HIGH POINTS OF REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE RELEASED. A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO- WHERE WE- ASSESS THE STATE'S POLICIES THE MAJOR POLICIES IN THE. TRANSPORTATION AREA THE SERGEANTS TO BE IN AN OUT HAND OUT WHICH TRY TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THOSE POINTS I'LL BE ONE THROUGH TODAY. I JUST FOR CONTACTS SO THAT REPORT WAS DONE IN RESPONSE TO THERE IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT OUR OFFICE. REVIEW THE ECONOMIC AND TAX AND BENEFITS OF THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS ANNUALLY. AND SO THE APPROACH WE'VE TAKEN IS TRY TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT SECTORS AND KIND OF POLICIES IN THOSE SECTORS. AND TRY TO LOOK AT THE AVAILABLE DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT THOSE POLICIES HAVE ACHIEVED BOTH GOOD AND BAD. AND WHERE THERE GAPS IN INFORMATION SO IT'S LARGELY A- KIND OF RETROSPECTIVE VIEW ON KIND OF WHAT WE WHAT WE ACHIEVED SO FAR WHICH WE HOPE IS KIND OF INFORMATIVE FOR YOU AS YOU SORT OF THINK ABOUT YOUR- YOUR GOALS GOING FORWARD. SO IF YOU TURN TO THE HAND OUT I'LL WE'VE TOUCHED ON SOME OF THIS INFORMATION ALREADY SO TRY TO MOVE THROUGH IT FAIRLY QUICKLY AND OF COURSE HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS. PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT TO STANDING GIVES YOU. SOME HIGH LEVEL CONTACTS FOR THE STATE'S REENHOUSE GAS SCHOOLS- ESTABLISH MAY BE THIRTY TWO AND SB THIRTY TWO. AS YOU KNOW WE- HAVE KIND OF HIT THAT- TWENTY TWENTY TARGET A FEW YEARS EARLY. I THINK ONE OF THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE CHART ON PAGE ONE IS THAT THE- TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IS YOU KNOW IS MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS THAN. TWENTY TWENTY GOAL IN TERMS OF KIND OF ANNUAL REDUCTIONS REQUIRED TO MEET THAT TARGET- JUST FOR CONTEXT THE KIND OF ANNUAL REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET WERE. ROUGHLY 1% PER YEAR. OR AS THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET IS CLOSER OF AMBITION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. TWENTY THIRTY. TURNING TO PAGE TWO. OF THE HAND OUT- DISTILLING DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE ON KIND OF WHERE WE'VE SEEN EMISSIONS GO OVER THE LAST. COUPLE OF DECADES. BROKEN OUT BY DIFFERENT SECTORS- I THINK THE MAIN STORY HERE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BEEN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR THAT HAS BEEN THE DRIVER OF ALMOST ALL. OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS WE SEEN OVER THE LAST. DECADE OR SO YOU CAN SEE. THE KIND OF THAT THE- LEFT SIDE OF THAT CHART THE SECOND HIGHEST LINE IS KIND OF THE ELECTRICITY. ON MISSIONS- AND ABOUT A DECADE AGO YOU SAW THOSE- MISSIONS DECLINED RATHER RAPIDLY- LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF. A GENERATION RESOURCES WE USE TO POWER ELECTRICITY GRID- ON THE OTHER HAND A LOT OF THE OTHER SECTORS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY FLAT AND YOU CAN SEE THE- TOP LINE THERE ARE TRANSPORTATION THE MAJOR SOURCE OF- BECAUSE- A SINGLE SOURCE OF EMISSIONS- DECLINE FOR A WHILE. AROUND THE TIME OF CRASH. RISK WITHIN IS S. AN UPTICK OR LOSS OF YEARS SOON AS YOU KNOW. SO TURN INTO PAGE THREE. OF THE HAND OUT- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO JUST LAY OUT NEAR THE POLICIES THAT WE TRIED TO LOOK AT AS PART OF OUR REPORT AND JUST PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT THE STATE HAS- IN DIFFERENT AREAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE OR ARE GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS IN TRANSPORTATION. SO WE DIVIDED ON INTO FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES- THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS- I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT ESSENTIALLY THERE'S- A MIX OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT- POLICIES HERE SO WE HAVE REBATES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS YOU DISCUSSED- HV STICKERS- WE HAVE REGULATIONS HICH ALSO A MENISCUS- CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. IN A PUBLIC FUNDING FOR ELECTRIC CHARGING IN IS ALSO A BIG OF THIS ON THE HEAVY DUTY SIDE AND WE FOCUS MOSTLY ON THE INCENTIVES THERE ARE SOME REGULATIONS IN HEAVY DUTY SECTOR BUT- OUR ANALYSIS WAS MAINLY IN THE- THE INCENTIVE SIDE OF THINGS. EVEN WITHIN THAT THERE IS STILL A DIFFERENT FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND THEY CAN FOCUS ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF KIND OF THE HEAVY DUTY CHALLENGE SO SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS TRYING TO PROMOTE A NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING THOSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PILOTING THOSE. THE ARE MORE FOCUSSED KIND OF PLANE MORE WELL DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES AND KIND OF EARLY- COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENT STAGE THROUGH- VOUCHERS- THEIR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE FOCUSED MORE ON LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS I LIKE THE CAR WHERE PROGRAM A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN FUNDING- AND THEN. AGAIN IN THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE THERE'S- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING RELATED TO- TO TRUCK CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. AND FINALLY LAST TWO CATEGORIES LOW CARBON FUELS IS A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED. AND THEN SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. SO REAL QUICK- JUST WANNA KINDA HIT THE HIGH POINTS ON FOR EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES WHAT KIND OF OUR MAIN TAKEAWAYS WERE AFTER HAVING TRIED TO REVIEW ALL THE- AVAILABLE INFORMATION- FOR THE LIGHT DUTY PROGRAMS I THINK. KIND AND FRANKLY THE MAIN TAKEAWAY IS THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECTS OF ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- WAS LARGELY ON CLEAR- AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW IN LARGE PART DUE TO JUST THE WIDE VARIETY OF PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN THAT AREA AND WE DO THINGS- YOU KNOW EVEN THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE EMISSIONS OF PICKED UP OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE DO THINK THAT. THESE PROGRAMS ARE HAVING SOME- AFFECTS OF KIND OF REDUCING EMISSIONS ASSIST RELATIVE TO WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN BUT TRYING TO TEASE OUT. BASICALLY WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF OUR REGULATIONS VERSES ARE INCENTIVES VERSUS OUR FUNDING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING AND THERE HASN'T FRANKLY THAN A LOT OF- CREE WORK IT'S AVAILABLE TO COUNTER. TRYING TO GET ANSWER TO THAT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE- MOHAMMED ON TO THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PIECE OF IT- AND THAT KIND OF MAIN TAKEAWAYS THERE. ARE THE- WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE ESTIMATES THAT HAVE PRODUCED BEEN PRODUCED BY THEIR BOARD AROUND THE GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM THOSE PROGRAMS. THEY ARE- GENERALLY MUCH MORE COSTLY THAN SOME OF THE OTHER POLICIES WE HAVE SO. ON AVERAGE WE LOOKED AT IT WAS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TON FORTY EIGHT SHE'S. A RANGING FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TON. AND COMPARING THAT TO pPROGRAMS WE HAVE CAP AND TRADE ALLOWANCE PRICES FOR CONTEXT OF SEVENTEEN DOLLARS PER TON- WE RECENTLY REVIEWED SOME- POLICY THING ELECTRICITY SECTOR- THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD WHICH RUN THE RANGE OF SIXTY TO SEVENTY DOLLARS PER TON SO THAT CAN SEE A- A BIT OF CONTEXT FOR THAT NUMBER- BUT I. ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KIND OF KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF THE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS GO BEYOND JUST SORT OF- NEAR TERM COST EFFECTIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN KIND OF WAY IN THE TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS. SO FOR EXAMPLE SUPPORT IN EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGIES WE THINK THERE COULD BE. A VERY KIND OF APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE THERE AND KIND OF- PROMOTING KNOWLEDGE BILL OVERTON PROMOTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAYBE THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WOULD PROVIDE ON ITS OWN- AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LOCAL AIR QUALITY BENEFITS YOU CAN GET FROM A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS A LOT OF THIS PROGRAM AS I MENTIONED. ARE KIND OF TRYING TO TACKLE SOME OF THOSE. MORE LOCAL AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO- TO THOSE CHALLENGES AND SO. ON WHEN THE KIND OF THINKING ABOUT KIND OF THE OVERALL BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THESE PROGRAMS IT'S- AN RV I THINK KIND OF A MATTER OF. WAY IN THOSE RELATIVELY HIGH KIND OF NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION COSTS WITH SOME OF THOSE OTHER BENEFITS THAT YOU. CAN SEE. FROM THESE PROGRAMS. FUEL STANDARD WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A KIND OF PROGRAM THAT ESSENTIALLY- PENALIZES RELATIVELY HIGH CARBON FUEL SUPPLIERS AND YOU KNOW- SUBSIDIZES RELATIVELY LOW CARBON FUEL SUPPLIERS THROUGH THE SYSTEM INCREDIBLE CREDITS THEIR ESTABLISHED- AND SEE A BASED ON SOME OF THE INFORMATION FROM CARVE IT- THE PROGRAM THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THE TRANSPORTATION FUEL MIX HAS DECREASED SINCE TWENTY TEN BY ABOUT. 4% AND I THINK IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF THE HAND OUT- ANTHOLOGIZED ON MOVING THROUGH IT RATHER QUICKLY BECAUSE AND- YOU WANNA LEAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS BUT I THINK THE ONE OF THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS IS THAT NEW CREDIT PRICES IN THAT PROGRAM. RIGHT NOW AROUND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TON SO LESS THAN KIND OF SOME OF THE COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS BUT RELATIVE TO. SOME OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE CAP AND TRADE- QUITE A BIT HIGHER- AND AGAIN AND I THINK WE THINK SORT OF SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED IN OUR- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT YOU'RE BEGINNING FROM. THE LCS US PROGRAM THAT YOU CAN'T GET FROM SOME OF. SOME OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE COST EFFECTIVE SO FOR EXAMPLE. IS THE L. SURFACE KIND OF PUSHING INNOVATION IN THIS SPACE AND A LOW CARBON FUEL SPACE OR THE DOING SORT OF A YOU KNOW OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW CARBON PRICING FOR EXAMPLE LONG CAN. CAN ACCOMPLISH. PAGE EIGHT- HAS JUST SOME COMMENTS ON SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. SELECT THERE'S BEEN. QUITE A ROBUST DISCUSSION AROUND THAT- THAT- PIECE OF THE PUZZLE SO FAR I THINK OUR FINDINGS KIND OF REFLECT A LOT OF THE- THE DISCUSSION THAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR THAT THAT YOU KNOW THOSE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. ARE TARGETS OF NOT REALLY BEEN MET AND THERE'S- YOU KNOW THAT'S A TOUGH ISSUE. SO IF IT I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO. PAGE NINE- WHERE I'M GONNA HOPEFULLY TRY TO KIND OF WRAP UP- YOU KNOW THE- THE WIDE VARIETY OF COMMENTS RELATED ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND KIND OF. SYNTHESIZE BUT WE THINK ARE KIND OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS- FIRST AS ANY OF THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACTS OF THE POLICIES IN MANY CASES NOT IN ALL THEIR SOME GOOD INFORMATION BUT THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE. OF THE A IN TAXES SOME OF THESE POLICIES IS UNCLEAR- I THINK THAT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO. WHEN THESE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ARE DEVELOPED- UP FRONT WHAT KIND OF THE ESTIMATED IMPACTS OF THOSE WILL BE- THERE'S RELATIVELY LITTLE WORK. AND KIND OF STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR ABOUT A WOOD IN AFTER THE FACT AFTER THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. WHAT WE KNOW SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE LINE ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED AND SO. YOU KNOW IT THAT THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS IN TRYING TO. TEASE OUT EXACTLY WHICH ONE IS DOING HOW MUCH AND WHAT- BUT WE DO THINK- OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE LOS LEGISLATURE THINK ABOUT WAYS TO KIND OF ESTABLISH A MORE. ROBUST SYSTEM FOR EVALUATING. THE EFFECTS OF THE POLICIES AFTER THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED SO YOU CAN HAVE THAT INFORMATION. FOR POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS GOING FORWARD. THE SECOND MAIN POINT- IS THAT. BASED ON OUR REVIEW IN THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE SO FAR- THE POLICIES AND TRANSPORTATION SECTOR RELATIVELY. COSTLY COMPARED TO SOME OF OUR- OTHER POLICIES- AND SO WE DO RECOMMEND SNOW FOCUSING TRYING TO FOCUS ON OUR MOST COST EFFECTIVE POLICIES WE THINK IN OUR- IN OUR RECAPPING. TRADE AND JUST ECONOMY WIDE CARBON PRICING IN GENERAL IS THE MOST. COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH- AND WE THINK NO COST EFFECTIVENESS BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AS THE GOALS BECOME MORE AMBITIOUS HANDS. ON SOME OF THE WILL AND IN FOR. TARGET TAKEN AND SO TRYING- YOU. PLACE EVEN A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COST EFFECTIVENESS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE- WITH THAT SAID THERE ARE SOME. VERY GOOD REASONS TO IMPLEMENT SOME COMPLIMENTARY POLICIES WHERE THEY MAKE SENSE AND SO- I THINK OUR- OUR SUGGESTION IS JUST KIND OF THINK ABOUT- WHAT ARE THE OTHER GOALS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER POLICIES THAT. MIGHT BE MORE COSTLY ON ON A KIND OF NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS BASIS BUT- THEY'RE STILL A STRONG RATIONALE FOR. THE STATE TO INTERVENE IN AND ADOPT AN ADDITIONAL POLICY IN THAT AREA SO TWO. EXAMPLES THAT I MENTIONED ARE KIND OF IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPACE AND PUSHING TECHNOLOGIES WHERE EVEN IF THERE IS A HIGHER CARBON PRICE IT MIGHT NOT- YOU KNOW IN. THE PRIVATE SECTOR MIGHT NOT KIND OF THE DOCTORS TECHNOLOGIES DUE TO A VARIETY OF OTHER FACTORS- AND THEN FOCUSING ON LOCAL AIR POLLUTION THERE MIGHT BE. KIND OF AGAIN YOU KNOW VERY- SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS AND LOCAL AIR POLLUTION BEYOND SORT OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS SPACE AND SO THERE MIGHT BE A VERY GOOD REASON TO. TO BE PUT ON SOMEBODY'S POLICY AND THEN THE- COMMENT I GUESS I JUST US. BACK A LITTLE BIT IS AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT KIND OF THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF POLICIES GOING FORWARD. THINK ABOUT WHICH POLICIES ARE. NOT LIKELY TO ENCOURAGE EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS GIVEN THE GLOBAL NATURE OF THIS PROBLEM. CALIFORNIA BEING A MALE ABOUT EMISSIONS. THING ABOUT WHERE OUR POLICIES MAKING A DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE BORDER IF KIND OF THE PRIMARY TARGET HERE IS SORT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IN ADDRESSING THAT AND- THAT COULD MEAN THINKING ABOUT IT IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS ONE. OUR POLICIES SERVING AS AFFECTED DEMONSTRATIONS TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS SORE OTHER JURISDICTIONS KIND OF LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA AND- AND LIKELY TO KIND OF A TOP SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT WERE TESTING OUT HERE- AND THEN THE OTHER IS THINKING ABOUT IT ON A- FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL LENDS OUR OUR POLICIES PUSHING. TECHNOLOGIES THAT- IF THEY BECOME CHEAPER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE ARE LIKELY TO BE ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND SO THAT. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO KIND OF HIM MAXIMIZE AND KIND OF INCREASE THE OVERALL EFFECT THAT THE- THE STATE'S POLICIES HAVE HERE BEYOND JUST CALIFORNIA BORDERS SO- THAT. TRIED TO COVER A LOT OF MATERIAL- PRETTY QUICKLY THEIR SON HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL YOUR COMMENTS- I WILL. ALSO WONDERED DID THE FOLKS FROM CARVE WANNA HELP PARTICIPATE IN THIS DISCUSSION- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW. YOUR AGENCIES. MEMBER KID HERE- KIND OF MERRY I'VE SAID TO LEAVE BUT IF YOU GUYS WANNA. BE HERE FOR THE DISCUSSION. DO YOU DO YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY KIND OF REACT A GOOD INITIAL REACTION BEFORE WE OPEN UP TO THE SENATORS ARE. M. GOOD MORNING AT SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CHAIRS. I REGION- SO HEAD OF THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD AND- MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT ROSS MADE WE ACTUALLY VERY MUCH AGREE WITH. IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE OTHER FACTORS FOR THESE PROGRAMS MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CALLED FOR IN THE REPORT FOR LA YOU. ARE ACTUALLY PROGRAMS THAT ARE SCOPING PLAN FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO ACHIEVE OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. WHEN WE DEVELOP THAT SCOPING PLAN WE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT MANY OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO SEE IF WE COULD LEVERAGE THOSE EXISTING AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS FOR THEIR CO BENEFITS FOR GREENHOUSE GASES. WHAT WE REALIZED WAS WAS THAT BECAUSE OF THE FDERAL MANDATES FOR STATE IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS ARE REGIONAL AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAD IN A- TOOL KIT OF TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ORDER IN PLACE THAT WE COULD LEVERAGE FOR THE SCOPING PLAN. SO THE pPROGRAMS. IS ACTUALLY AIR QUALITY WE'RE LEVERAGING THE CO BENEFITS AND SO WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT THOSE WITH GIGI LANDS WE'RE NOT SEEING THE COMPLETE PICTURE. AND MISTER BROWN FROM LA- ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THAT THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE BROADER PICTURE. AND SO IF WE WENT BACK TO THE SCOPING PLAN AND WE PULLED OUT SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WE SAID WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SCOPING PLANET JUST THINK ABOUT- DO WE NEED THESE PROGRAMS AT ALL. WE WOULD SAY YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NECESSARY FOR AIR QUALITY TARGETS AND GOALS. PROGRAMS LIKE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. ARE ACTUALLY DISPLACING ABOUT TWO POINT THREE BILLION GALLONS OF DIESEL. FUEL EVERY YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY REFUSE KNOCKS BY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TONS ACROSS THE STATE. AND SO. TO READ ABOUT AIR QUALITY FIRST. AND THEY TO LIVE CO BENNETT U. G. SO. OKAY WELL. ALRIGHT I KNOW WHO TO A CATCH YOU CAN HAVE SOM QUESTIONS HERE THIS. WE ALWAYS STRUGGLE WITH SCORING- THE COST AND OF COURSE A GREENHOUSE GASES AND WE HAVE OUTSIDE THE TRANSPORTATION FIELD WE HAVE AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS WE HAVE- VARIETY DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- ARE WE- IT. SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL FOR THE TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS OR THE BEST PRACTICED CHANGE AT CHANGES I'M THINKING METHANE REDUCTION IN A WE HAVE THE ANAEROBIC DIGESTERS WE HAVE MANY WERE MANAGEMENT. MUCH LOWER PRICE FOR CARBON REDUCTION- IN FIVE AND IF EFFECTS THE WORLD IT AFFECTS THE WAITED THAT. MANURE MANAGERS ALL OVER THE WORLD WILL WORK ON IT I'M IN FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST OF THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR THERE ARE VEHICLE PROGRAM HOW DO I BALANCE THAT YOU KNOW BESIDES BALANCING THESE OTHERS EXTERNALITIES HOW DO I LOOK AT I GET LIMITED FUNDS WORK THE MONEY IS. SHRINKING. YEAH I MEAN IT'S A TOUGH BALANCE AND AN EIGHT TO BE QUITE FRANK I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN KIND OF GIVE YOU AN EXACT ANSWER OF KIND OF EXACTLY HOW TO WEIGH THOSE THINGS BUT I THINK YOU'VE KIND OF HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD ON. HOW WE THINK YOU SHOULD BE KIND OF THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO PRIORITIZE THESE DIFFERENT FUNDS I MEAN IN ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS LOOK AT. YOU KNOW PURELY ON KIND OF YOU KNOW NEAR OR MID TERM- ANNOUCEMENT OPTIONS WITHIN THE STATE WHAT'S THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ACHIEVE THOSE REDUCTIONS AND- SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS MIGHT SCORE OUT PRETTY WELL BASED ON THAT METRIC AND IF THAT'S- THE PRIMARY GOAL- THEN YOU'RE FOCUSING RESOURCES AND PRIORITIZING RESOURCES IN THAT AREA. I THINK YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE BAG AND MATH PIECE DOES THOSE ARE PIECES THAT KIND OF CONCERT FALL OUTSIDE OF. THE KIND OF SCOPE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS WELL AND SO WE THINK THAT'S KIND OF ANOTHER REASON TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT FOCUSING ON- RESOURCES AND FUNDING IN THAT. KIND OF ON IT IS THAT MAYBE I TARGETED BY. OR COVERED BY THE CAPTAIN TRADE PRO. BUT IT IS THIS BALANCE OF CAN ABOUT WELL. THERE ARE POTENTIALLY OTHER BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR SON. TECHNOLOGIES AND PUSHING THOSE NEWER TECH JEEZ SLEEP YOU DO THE YOU MIGHT HAVE PLUS THIS IS FOR SOME OF THOSE. THE THINGS THAT JUST TALKING ABOUT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A- YOU KNOW AN EASY ANSWER ON KIND OF YOU KNOW HOW YOU WANT TO PRIORITIZE. AMONG THOSE THINGS BUT- TYPE OF THINKING OKAY PLAN THOSE THOSE THOSE. BENEFITS WITHIN IS THE WAY TO. A TWO APPROACH IT. YEAH ME. THE POOR. I MEAN. THE BUDGET HAS SAID. THAT CHURN. HAS A DRESS. READ IN THE C. V. R. P. PROGRAM. THEY HAVE A DRASTIC. REDUCTION IN. THE BUT- PASSED MY MIND- IN. A CAR MORE YOUR PROGRAM- INCENTIVES THAT WE HAD YOU KNOW THE SENATE HAS HAD LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WANTED TO INCENTIVIZE HE'S VERY POPULAR PROGRAMS IT SEEM TO YOU KNOW MOVE PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO A NO OF A PUSH BACK FOR- THE BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AND WITH THESE WITH THESE POPULAR PROGRAMS THAT ARE OVER SUBSCRIBE DID SEEM TO GET US TO YOU KNOW OUR E. V. E. N. A. N. HELPS US WITH THE EMISSION. REDUCTIONS THE AIRPORT. DAVID GARCIA LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- IS ABOUT WELL IN ANY BUDGET IS ABOUT BALANCING PRIORITIES AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THERE IS JUST LESS MONEY AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE REVENUES IN IF YOU WANT WE CAN ANSWER THE SPECIFICS OF WHY THAT HAPPENED- BUT- FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OR THE PEOPLE WHO BALANCE THOSE PRIORITIES WE WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THEM IN TERMS OF THE DECISIONS THEY MADE. I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A YEARLY- EXERCISE THAT WE HAVE THE BUDGET COMES OUT THE LA APPLE N. CENTER WHAT CASKEY HAS PROJECTIONS ON WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS THE GOVERNOR FINANCE LOBEL SAID AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN WE FINALLY HAVE OUR LAST OPTION IN MAY THE- FISCAL YEAR. WE'RE IN THREE POINT TWO THREE POINT FOUR BILLION ABOUT A BILLION MORE IN AUCTION SALES- EACH YEAR IT IT IN THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS MY SIX YEAR IN THIS THE SENATE AND IT THIS WE GO RUN AROUND AND WE STILL HAVE A SLUGGISH- RANGE YEAH. WE HAVE IN SIX YEARS WE'VE STOP QUEEN. SINCE EIGHTEEN DOLLARS MILE I'M IN THE STATE SENATE IN N. Y. WHY IS THE REPORT COMING UP WITH SUGGESTIONS OR TO INCREASE THOSE OPTIONS AND INCREASE THE PRICE OF CARBON THAT THE DEBT THE STATIONARY SOURCES THE COVERED ENTITIES FUNDED. THE PROGRAM WE WERE WERE STUCK AT SEVENTEEN IT SEEMS TO BE TO ALL THESE EXTERNALITIES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR YOUR NEW SCOPING PLAN. FOR PUBLIC. WHAT DIRECTION WE GETTING FOR YOU. TRYING TO CAR MORE APPROPRIATELY. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION  KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN MANY OF THE HEARINGS LATELY AM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ISSUED EACH YEAR AND EACH YEAR THE AMOUNT OF THOSE ALLOWANCES DECREASES BECAUSE YOU WANT EMISSIONS TO DECREASE OVER ON THE STATE. ACCORDINGLY LESS ALLOWANCES PERMITS TO POLLUTE THAT ARE PROVIDED. SO YOU HAVE THAT DECLINING POOL OF ANNOUNCES THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR SALE YOU HAVE SOME THAT ARE GOING TO INDUSTRY AND INCREASING A LITTLE BIT THE AMOUNT OF ANNOUNCES THAT ARE GOING TO INDUSTRY BASED ON DIRECTION THAT WE RECEIVED N AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. BUT IN THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN ESCALATING FLOOR PRICE FOR THE AUCTIONS AND ESCALATES EACH YEAR BY 5% PLUS INFLATION SO IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE FLOOR PRICE WAS TEN DOLLARS. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY OR TWENTY TWENTY IT'S NOW ABOUT SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE BUT THE ALLOWANCES THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE DEMAND IS THERE DEAR SOMETHING OUT AND ABOVE THE FLOOR PRICE SO AT THE LAST AUCTION- ALLOWANCES SOLD AT EIGHTEEN DOLLARS A TON ABOUT THE FLOOR PRICE. AND SO WE ARE SEEING THAT INCREASING CARBON PRICE SIGNAL AND FOR THE ECONOMY AND IT'S BASED ON THE DEMAND FOR THE BALANCES THAT DID IS BASED ON. IN MAKING TO ON SITE. AND HOW OTHERS ARE PERFORMING TERMS LIKE ELECTRICITY TRANSPORTATION ETCETERA. SUE THERE IS AN ANTICIPATION THE MARKET THAT THE MARKET'S GOING TO GET TIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO GET TIRED VERY QUICKLY STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE BEFORE PRICES ARE ALREADY FOR THE FOR THE ALLOWANCES ARE SELLING ABOUT BEFORE PRICE TODAY. TOO EARLY NOW. I. ARE WE ARE WE COMFORTABLE ARE WE COMFORTABLE WITH THE 5% INCREASE IN THE IN THE FLOOR PRICE GIVEN WHAT THE EUROPEANS ARE DOING AS HAVE THEY'RE HAVING THEIR OPTIONS AT THIRTY DOLLARS- PER METRIC TON IN WHAT THE WORLD BANK HAS SUGGESTED THAT THAT THE PRICE OF CARBON ARE ALLOWING SHE SHOULD BE FORTY TO EIGHTY I MEAN WE'VE GONE FROM SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN IN THIS THIS TODAY TODAY'S AUCTION OR LAST WEEK'S AUCTION- IS THAT IS IN THERE MORE INCENTIVE THAT THE AIRPORT COULD DO OUR OR SIGNALS TO THE MARKET ABOUT WHERE WE WANT TO SEE PRICES IN. IN FOUR YEARS BECAUSE IF WE GO 5% PER YEAR PER YEAR THAT'S WAS AT. EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETY CENSUS THREE DOLLARS FOUR DOLLARS SOME FOR TALKING ABOUT 4% DECREASE PER YEAR TOTAL EMISSIONS YOU KNOW WE'VE GONE 1% TO TWENTY TWENTY THAT WE HAVE TO GO 24% AND WE'RE TALKING FOUR DOLLARS. SEND SEND OF ENOUGH FOR YOUR MODELING. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT CAP AND TRADE IS NOT THE ONLY TOOL THAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS ANDIT'S ONE OF MANY TOOLS AND A SUITE OF POLICIES AND THE SCOPING PLAN WHAT YOU SEE IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS A PRICE THAT'S ON TOP OF THE COST REDUCING EMISSIONS AND ALL THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE OUR PS ADVANCE CLEAN CARS- SB THREE FIFTY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AND FOR THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD SO WHEN WE SEE VALUE SUCH AS A HUNDRED DOLLARS A TON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS PRICES IF THERE WAS ONLY A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND THERE WERE NO OTHER POLICIES AVAILABLE TO HELP REDUCE EMISSIONS AND SO- COMPARING THOSE PRICES AGAINST EACH OTHER ISN'T COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES NECESSARILY. IN TERMS OF THE PRICES FOR THE PROGRAM AND THE NEXT DECADE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT WE'VE REDUCED EMISSIONS BELOW THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET FOR YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE THE CAPS ARE SET ACCORDINGLY IN THE PROGRAM WITH THE OTHER POLICIES LIKE LC FAST ADVANCE IN CARS TO MAKE SURE WE HAD THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET. WERE HAD A SCHEDULE BUT WHAT ALSO HAPPENED IN THE LAST COPING PLAN IS WE SIGNALED THAT STARTING FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THIRTY WE HAVE TO HAVE A MORE STRINGENT PROGRAMS. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM STRINGENT WE MADE ALL CFS MORE STRING. WHICH IT MADE OUR STRINGENT AND SO THOSE PER AND THAT STRAY STARTS TO KICK IN IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY EARLY TWENTY TO START EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND I DON'T. ALL SIX LOOKS LIKE SO THE NEXT DECADE IN TERMS OF RESPONSE FROM BUSINESS RESPONSE FROM CONSUMERS RESPONSE IN ENERGY SOURCES- IS GONNA LOOK QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TODAY BECAUSE EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE RESPONDING TO MUCH MORE STRINGENT PROGRAMS THE LA- RICHEST REPORTED THAT ALL THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS FOR TWENTY TWO UNDER AB THIRTY TWO TO TWENTY TWENTY CAN BE- ACCUMULATED ELECTRIC TRICITY SECTION IS THE R. P. S. STANDARDS ALL THE REST OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOW COULD BE MORE STRINGENT DID NOTHING. ESSENTIALLY FOR AS FAR AS HE MISSION REDUCTION RELATIVELY NOTHING I MEAN THEY THEY MOVE FROM ONE SIDE OF THE GRAPH THE OTHER SERIGRAPH BUT FLAT LINED SINCE SINCE WE STARTED THE AUCTION PROGRAM SEVEN YEARS AGO SO. I'VE BEEN CRITICAL OF I THINK IT'S NOT ENOUGH OF THE GUIDANCE THAT YOU GIVEN TO THAT THE MARKET PLACE AND YES WE'RE ALL GOING TO HOLD OUR BREATH TILL TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVEMENT AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN. INCREASES IN SOME OF THESE AND AREAS SO I A CAN YOU. OTHER THAN YOU HAVE A PLAN AND YOU HAVE A OR YOU'RE YOU'RE HOPING FOR IT THERE ARE OTHER MECHANISMS SO YOU CAN YOU YOU CAN PRICE. THE CARBON I MEAN YOU YOU. THERE'S THERE IS A SIGNAL THAT YOU CAN GIVE TO THE MARKET- WITH THE WITH THE PRICE THAT- THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING THERE SEEMS TO BE A HESITATION BY. THIS ADMINISTRATION TO TELL CALIFORNIANS OR TELL THE WORLD THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT PRICING CARBON AND WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF RELYING ON THESE PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE A LACKLUSTER. FIVE PERFORMANCE SAVE THE U. BIO USED SAID OF HAVE HELPED BUILD THIS OUT ON OUR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. I AM SO I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE LIKE A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD VANCE CLEAN CARS THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE DELIVERED REDUCTIONS IF IT WEREN'T FOR THOSE PROGRAMS ARE MISSIONS WOULD BE A LOT HIGHER TODAY AND SO EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH IT LOOKS LIKE. THE REDUCTIONS HAVING OCCURRED WE'VE ACTUALLY CONSTRAINED REDUCTIONS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THOSE PROGRAMS REDUCTION OR EMISSIONS WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER- WITH LC FEST WE'VE DONE ESTIMATES BACK OF THE ENVELOPE ESTIMATES THAT THEY WOULD BE FIVE MILLION TONS HIGHER EVERY YEAR FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS IF THAT PROGRAM HADN'T BEEN IN PLACE. AND SO WE TOOK TO HEART THE COMMENTS THAT THE EARLIER REPORT MADE ABOUT THE RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO T. SOME OF THIS INFORMATION OUT TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE. AND IN TERMS OF THE SIGNALS AND THE PRICES AND WHY WE SEEM A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS MARKET ADMINISTRATORS WHAT WE SAY AND HOW WE DISCUSSED THE MARKET FUNDAMENTALS AND MARKET DESIGN. CAN SEND UNINTENDED SIGNAL TO THE MARKET AND ADD UNCERTAINTY AND SO WE TRY TO AVOID THAT IN PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS WE TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO THOUGHT FLUENTLY REALLY HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS SO THAT EVERYBODY IS ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CONTEXT AROUND IT. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CAPS FOR CAP AND TRADE YOU SEE THAT THEY ARE DROPPING FOURTEEN MILLION TONS YEAR OVER YEAR STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S A HUGE SIGNAL TO THE MARKET PLACE. AND THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PRICED IN AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING PRICES IN THE OPTIONS STEP LEAVE ABOUT FOUR PRICE TODAY. LISTEN INTERESTING BUT WE'RE I DO ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE ALLOWANCES PRODUCER HAS BEEN INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF TOO MANY FREE ALLOWANCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S BEEN A PRODUCT OF AS THE- AS THE OPERATOR OF THE MARKET THAT THEIR URGES THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY AND THE SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE GIVING IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE FREE ALLOWANCES. THAT ARE GONNA BE AVAILABLE THERE'S A GLUT OF ALLOWANCES RIGHT NOW THAT IS NOT CHANGING BEHAVIOR FROM THE STATION SOURCES IN THE COVER. COVERED ENTITIES WHAT'S THE- I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A DEBATE CLASS SERVICE. I HAD A ROUGH DAY YESTERDAY I'M SORRY OKAY. OKAY SO THE AMOUNT OF ALLOWANCES THAT WE GIVE IT TO INDUSTRY IS TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTION AB THIRTY TO ABOUT MINIMIZING LEAKAGE YOU DON'T WANT INDUSTRY TO MOVE PRODUCTION IF YOU DON'T WANT INDUSTRY TO PICK UP A MOVE OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IT LOOKS LIKE ON OUR BOOKS WE ACHIEVED A REDUCTION BUT THE AT THE EMISSIONS ARE ACTUALLY KERN SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY'RE STILL HAPPENING SO WE GIVE ALLOWANCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP KEEP THE INDUSTRY COMPETITIVE BUT STILL SEND SOME SIGNAL TO THEM THAT THEY NEED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND SO WE DON'T GIVE ANYBODY A 100% OF THE ALLOWANCES THEY NEED TO COMPLY. WHAT HAPPENS IS IN AB THREE EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT WE GOT DIRECTION. TO CONSIDER ALL INDUSTRY. AS HIGH RISK FOR LEAKAGE. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN A REGULATION NOW AND THE- REGULATION THAT WE ADOPTED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH AB THREE NINETY EIGHT IS. THE WE HAVE A SUSTAINED AMOUNT OF FREE ALLOCATION TO INDUSTRY- BASED ON DIRECTION IN LEGISLATION. BUT STILL EVEN UNDER THAT SCENARIO WE'RE STILL NOT GIVING ANYBODY A 100% OF WHAT THEY NEED. SO PEOPLE ARE STILL FACING- A NEED TO EITHER REDUCE EMISSIONS ON SITE OR GOING TO THE MARKET PLACE AND BY ALLOWANCES. OKAY MR HOTEL HAS OF COURSE I WOULD SAY YOU WON THAT DEBATE. I FOR ONE HAVE FEEL VERY- REFRESH THAT WE HAVE A REGULATOR THAT'S LOOKING AT ALL THESE ISSUES THAT YOU'LL WITH LEAKAGE. AND YOU KNOW PUTTING A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO IT I YOU KNOW I I'M REALLY LOOKING TO LEARN A LOT MORE IN THIS AREA IN I GUESS TOUGH THE ONE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS HAVE YOU DONE ANY STUDIES ON. LIKE THE PRICE ELASTICITY ON- YOU KNOW THIS AUCTION AND IF IT. WE WERE TO GO TO A POINT WHERE WE- ARBITRARILY INCREASE THE PRICE WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF. YOU HEALTH. ACTUALLY GETTING LAST OR NOT GETTING ENOUGH- THE- MARGINALLY TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE IN THE LAST COPING PLAN THAT THE BOARD ADOPTED IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE RAN A SCENARIO WHERE WE HAD A CARBON PRICE OF FIFTY DOLLARS A TON. AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED IN THAT IS THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE INDUSTRY AND EMISSIONS LEAKAGE OCCURRING THE STATE BECAUSE OUR INDUSTRY WOULD NOT BE COMPETITIVE AT THAT PRICE AND THEY'RE ONLY. RESPONSE WOULD BE TO EITHER REDUCE PRODUCTION IN STATE OR HAVE THAT ACTIVITY MOVE OUT OF STATE AND SO WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC ANALYSES WE HAVE ALL OF THE TECHNICAL WORK TO SUPPORT THAT SCENARIO AND THAT EVALUATION ON OUR WEBSITE WOULD BE HAPPY TO. SHARE THAT YEAH I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT. I SHOULD PREFACE THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE- FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY. THE. SO I AND I AND- JUST TO GET YOUR REACTION TO. THE ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY OKAY THE CREDIBILITY- FACTOR IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS. AND TO HAVE CREDIBILITY IN THE TRANSPORTATION. AREA WHEN YOU ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS PROGRAMS ARE OPTIONS. IT REQUIRES THE PROPER ANALYSIS AND A PROPER FEAR ANALYSIS I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE OKAY WE'RE NOT THERE SO. THE QUESTION IS. HOW DO WE GO ABOUT CREATING A STRUCTURE. DEAD IMPROVES THE PROPER ANALYSIS IN THE TRANSPORTATION AREA SO THAT'S THE QUESTION BOB VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED I DON'T LIKE THAT OKAY I'M A I'M A PLANNER I WAS ON THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS OKAY SIR DODD. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT YOU ALSO SHOULD LOOK AT. THINGS LIKE CONGESTION ARE YOU ARE YOU. LIKE MY WIFE SAYS I DON'T REALLY CARE HOW MANY MILES HAVE TO TRAVEL I CARE HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET TO WHERE I'M GOING. AND I THINK THE AVERAGE PERSON LOOKS AT IT THAT WAY QUITE FRANKLY. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT. THE TIME IT TAKES NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THE TIME IT TAKES. WOULD MEAN THAT THE CAR WOULD BE RUNNING A LONGER. AND THEREFORE POLLUTING MORE. OKAY SO CARD OTHER OTHER IDEAS WOULD BE HOW MUCH GASOLINE IS BEING USED. GOT OVERALL GASOLINE USAGE I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT SOME KIND OF MEASUREMENT DID MEASURES THAT. I ALSO THINK I ALSO THINK. THEN WHEN WE PROPOSED. POLICIES ON TRANSPORTATION AREA. WE SHOULD FIND EMILY LOOK AT IT WHAT DOES IT DO IN TERMS OF TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. ARE WE PROMOTING PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR CARS EITHER WALKING BY SCHOOLING OR USING TRANSIT. IS THERE ARE- APPALLED IS DOES THE POLICY- HELD. CONVERT PEOPLE FROM USING CARS WHICH POLLUTES. I WE I WOULD EVEN ARGUE THAT ELECTRIC CARS POLLUTE BECAUSE WHEN YOU STILL HAVE THE NUMBER OF CARS IN THE POPULATION GROWS AND EVERYBODY BUYS CARS AND THE FREEWAYS STATE CONGESTED. THERE'S OTHER CARS ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE POLLUTING MORE% BECAUSE- THE VEHICLE HOURS TRAVEL IS CONTAINED TO GET LONGER THE MEDIC GASOLINE PURCHASE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HAVING MORE ELECTRIC CARS THEM OUT OF GASOLINE. THAT'S PURCHASED IS CONTINUE TO RISE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STAY IN THEIR CARS LONGER AND FROM THE TAXPAYERS STANDPOINT THEY WANT. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET TO AND FROM WHERE THEY'RE GOING. IN LESS TIME OKAY THAT'S- THAT'S A THAT'S A GOAL THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. SO I HAD A QUESTION REGARDING THAT IS- IS THERE ANYBODY LOOKING AT. CHANGING THE FRAMEWORK TO EMPHASIZE TRANSIT. TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS TRANSIT RIGHT IS THE IMPACT OF YOUR POLICIES ON TRANSIT RIDERSHIP LOOKED OUT. OF I'M I'M A MAJOR ADVOCATE I'VE BEEN PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST ADVOCATES IN. THE STATE FOR TRANSIT RIDERS TRANSIT PROGRAMS SO HOW DO YOU ANALYZE TRANSIT. IN TERMS OF HOW WOULD YOU ANALYZE IT ROSS AND MAYBE CAN. AND CREATE A PROPER SYSTEMATIC WAY OF LOOKING AT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE I MEAN. CENTER ABOUT MINUTES- I THINK IT DIFFICULT QUESTION AND TO BE QUITE FRANK I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE AN EXACT ANSWER- BUT I THINK CERTAINLY KIND OF ANSWER ANYWHERE THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YEAH SO I MEAN I THINK CERTAINLY THINKING ABOUT THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE KIND OF WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE GOAL THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT MORE TRANSIT RIGHT PART OF IT SO YEAH IS IT. MORE PEOPLE USING TRANSIT RIGHT AND SO AS FAR AS SORT OF SETTING UP A STRUCTURE FOR GETTING GOOD ANSWERS TO THAT AND I THINK ONE IMPORTANT THING IN OUR MIND IS THINKING ABOUT AS PROGRAMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. IN THE EARLY STAGES THINKING ABOUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET ANSWERS TO SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE ASKING HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET ANSWERS TO HOW IT HAS AFFECTED TRANSIT RIDERSHIP BECAUSE THESE ARE ARE OFTENTIMES VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT ARE INFLUENCING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. IN ADDITION TO A SPECIFIC PROGRAM THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED WHEN YOU ANALYZE THE GREENHOUSE GAS. EMISSIONS REDUCTION POLICIES DO THEY SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT HOW THAT IMPACTS TRANSIT RIDERSHIP THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MY OPINION. BECAUSE OF AN IMPASSE IT IN A NEGATIVE WAY. YOU SHOULD SAY THAT ALL THE POLICIES WE DO DO NOT. DECREASE OR IMPACT IN A NEGATIVE WAY TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. THAT SIR MY VIEW IF I SEE MORE. POLICIES THAT- SOUND LIKE THEY'RE GOOD BUT THEN THE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS IMPACTED IN A BAD WAY I DON'T I DON'T PARTICULARLY THINK THAT'S ACHIEVING OUR THAT'S GOES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION WHICH YEAH SO OUR ANALYSIS LOOKED AT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WOULD NOT FOCUS ON- TRANSIT RIDERSHIP THERE ARE WITH THIS SESSIONS ABOUT FROM MY EYES SURE THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. I'M INTERESTED IN A TRANSIT RIDERSHIP PART OF YEAH I THINK THERE ARE FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT BE KIND OF A PIECE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT THEY DO ON KIND OF TRYING TO ESTIMATES- OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT- THE DETAILS OF THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU OKAY THANK YOU I WILL SAY I THINK THE NEXT PANEL- WE GOT A COUPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSIT EXPERTS- YEAH RIGHT WHO CAN. BANG FLASH ON THE SIDE. TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. STUFF OUT THE YOU'RE TALKING BUT I'M PASSED ABOUT AS WELL SO. LOSE WITH YOUR FORBEARANCE NUMBER AMOUNT OF GASOLINE ISN'T THAT A YEAH THE- PEOPLE CAN. DO THEY LOOK AT LIKE WHEN THEY LOOK AT GREEN EYES SEEMS LIKE HOW MUCH GASOLINE IS PURCHASED. I MEAN THAT'S- THE GASOLINE'S BERM SO IT'S POLLUTING SO WHEN WE SEE THE GASOLINE. PURCHASES FROM NIGHT DECREES THAT'S THIS KIND OF A BAD BILL WHETHER FOR US IN TERMS OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS RIGHT SO THE KIND OF DEALING WITH THAT ISSUE. I'LL JUST ADD IT IS JENNIFER DRESS BOARD JUST TO- ON YOUR TRANSIT RIDERSHIP QUESTION WHEN UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHEN WE EVALUATE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES OFTENTIMES NPOS DO. PUT TRANSIT RELATED MEASURES IN THEIR PLANS AND SO WILL WE WILL LOOK AT TRANSIT RIDERSHIP AS PART OF THEIR PLAN IF IT'S A IF IT'S A KEY STRATEGY IN IT. ALSO THERE ARE NUMBER OF TRANSIT FUNDING PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND THAT TRANSIT CAPITAL PROGRAM AND- AN AD THE SAID. AND BOTH OF THEM LOOK AT TRANSIT RIGHT SHIP WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER TO FUND THEM OR NOT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WOULD LIKE FOR THE FOLLOW UP ON ON THIS QUESTION. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS AND LET'S NOW GO ON TO THE NEXT PANEL WHICH I THINK ACTUALLY WILL WILL IT'S A GOOD SEGUE BECAUSE A NUMBER OF THEM ARE EXPERTS IN THIS AREA- LET'S START WE'RE SERVICES IN THE EIGHTIES THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION- I KNOW. SHE'S GOT BACK A DAVIS AT SOME POINT SOON SO WE WANT TO HEAR FROM% HER FIRST- DAVID ROLE IN HOLSTERS PROFESSOR UC BERKELEY BURN AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS. IN AUSTIN BROWN HIS DIRECTOR YOU SEE DAVIS POLICY INSTITUTE FOR ENERGY ENVIRONMENT ECONOMY IN CAPE GREEN. WITH EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO COMMITTEE CHAIR FOR THE COVERING TRANSIT ASSOCIATION SO LET'S HEAR FROM YOU FIRST. DIRECTOR HANDY. IS THE I BELIEVE US ANSWER. YET RIGHT. LET'S HEAR FROM YOU SEASON AND THEN WE'LL GO DOWN THE REST THE PANEL AND GET TO FLUSH OUT MORE THESE TOPICS THAT WE'VE BEEN. DISCUSSING ALL MORNING. IT'S A GREAT PANEL SOME REAL EXPERTISE HERE SO I WILL SERVE YOU DRESSER HANDY. GOOD MORNING THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ALL. I'M SUSAN HANDY I'M A PROFESSOR AT UC DAVIS WHERE I DIRECT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION- OF MY OWN WORK- FOCUSES ON. THE VMT QUESTIONS SO MY COMMENTS WILL BE AND FOCUSED ON THAT. SO AS WE HEARD THIS MORNING THE STATE HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON REDUCING EMISSIONS THROUGH. OF FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS EMISSIONS STANDARDS INCENTIVES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES- BUT ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE STATE WILL NOT MEET ITS GHG EMISSIONS GOALS WITHOUT ALSO REDUCING VEHICLE MILES OF TRAVEL- BY AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT- THIS IS A TALL ORDER GIVEN HOW MUCH DRIVING CALIFORNANS DO. A IS APPROACHING TEN THOUSAND MILES PER YEAR PER PERSON IN THE STATE FOR A WHILE IT LOOKED LIKE THINGS WERE LEVELING OUT- BUT LATEST DATA SUGGESTS THAT IT'S TRENDING BACK UPWARDS. IF THANK YOU SO BE AND HE IS ALL OF IT OFTEN BEEN CALLED THE SHAKY THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL MUCH HARDER TO ADDRESS THAN VEHICLES AND FUELS BUT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO MEETING OUR GOALS THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IF WE CAN DO IT WE GET MANY BENEFITS BEYOND- JUST EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS- OTHER KINDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ECONOMIC BENEFITS SOCIAL EQUITY BENEFITS AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS BUT OF COURSE THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW TO DO IT. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS QUESTION I APPROACH IT WITH A- A TWO STEP FRAMEWORK- IF YOU WILL AND ONE OF THE IMPORTANT POINT I WANT TO MAKE. THIS MORNING IS THAT BOTH OF THESE STEPS ARE VERY MUCH NECESSARY. SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DRIVE LESS AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE EFFORTS AT THE LOCAL SCALE AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL SCALE. SO THE LOCAL SCALE WE NEED LAND USE PATTERNS THAT BRING DESTINATIONS- WITHIN CLOSER REACH THAT WOULD MAKE DRIVING DISTANCES SHORTER AS WELL AS WALKING AND BIKING MORE VIABLE- WE NEED INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND THE QUALITY. OF THE WALKING AND BIKING EXPERIENCE THAT WILL ALSO HELP TRANSIT- WE'VE GOT BIKE SHARINGAND SCOOTER SHARING PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADDING TO OUR LOCAL OPTIONS BUT WE NEED BETTER WAYS TO INTEGRATE THOSE. INTO OUR LOCAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AT THE REGIONAL SCALE WE NEED INVESTMENTS IN TRANSIT SERVICE BOTH RAIL AND BUS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND THE COVERAGE OF THAT SERVICE. WE NEED LAND USE PATTERNS THAT ENHANCE THE VIABILITY OF TRANSIT WHICH MEANS HIGHER DENSITIES AROUND TRANSIT STATIONS IT MEANS LOCATING KEY REDDICK REGIONAL DESTINATIONS LIKE STADIUMS- NEAR RAIL STATIONS- AND OF COURSE WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN SHOP RICH AREAS. SO IF WE CAN DO THESE THINGS WE CREATE COMMUNITIES WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITHOUT DRIVING SO MUCH- IF WE DO THIS WE GET IMPORTANT EQUITY BENEFITS. IN TERMS OF ENSURING ADEQUATE ACCESSIBILITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO DRIVE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER- AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS THAT WE'VE GOT EXAMPLES OF ALL OF THESE STRATEGIES. IN CALIFORNIA WE HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THEM FROM SECRETARY KIM THIS MORNING- I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS IN MY TIME A IN THE FIELD THAT WE CLEARLY HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO THE SECOND STEP. IS THAT WE ALSO NEED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DRIVE LESS- SIMPLY GIVING THEM THE OPTION THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE LESS DOESN'T GUARANTEE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT. SO WE CAN OFFER A CARROT APPROACH WE CAN TRY AND ENTICE PEOPLE TO DRIVE LESS- WE COULD TRY SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO CHANGE THE NORMS AROUND DAILY TRAVEL. THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE ENOUGH WE COULD TRY PAYING PEOPLE TO CHOOSE ALTERNATIVES AND THERE'S SOME. EXAMPLES OF THAT AND THAT COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE- BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WERE ALSO CAN AND NEED TO WIELD THE STICK. AND THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THIS SO ONE STICK WE CAN WIELD OF COURSE IS TO MAKE DRIVING MORE EXPENSIVE. THROUGH VARIOUS FORMS OF PRICING WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT PARKING PRICING THIS MORNING. ON THE SORT OF CORDON PRICING THIS BEING CONSIDERED IN LA AND SAN FRANCISCO. ALL OF THESE THINGS- I THINK NEED TO BE ON THE TABLE. OF COURSE PRICING ALWAYS RAISES EQUITY CONCERNS BUT- IS PRETTY CLEAR THEIR WAYS THAT THOSE CAN BE MITIGATED- THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN THE ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING AND- EVEN PROVIDING SUBSIDIES- WHERE NEEDED. A SECOND STICK TO THINK ABOUT IS MAKING DRIVING LESS CONVENIENCE. ON AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTING PARKING MAXIMIN MAXIMUMS RATHER THAN PARKING MINIMUMS THAT MAKES DRIVING LESS CONVENIENT. AND ALSO HAS A SIDE BENEFIT OF MAKING WALKING BIKING AND pANOTHER EXAMPLE IS CLOSING STREETS TO PRIVATE VEHICLES THE WAY THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS DONE ON MARKET STREET AND APPARENTLY LA IS CONSIDERING THIS. AS WELL. BUT A THIRD STICK I WANT TO MENTION IS CONGESTION ITSELF AS A DETERRENT TO DRIVING- CLOGGED ROADS MAY BE ONE OF THE GREATEST INCENTIVES TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS AND TRYING SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. AND OF COURSE THAT THEN RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT- DO WE WANT TO BE EXPANDING HIGHWAYS IF OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE. THE M. T. AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE EVIDENCE ON THE INDUCED TRAVEL A FACT- OF AT A CAPACITY SHOWS THAT THE ANSWER IS A CLEAR NO- THAT IF WE INCREASE CAPACITY WE INCREASE THE ANTI. WITHOUT ACTUALLY DECREASING CONGESTION IN ANY APPRECIABLE WAY SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE DOING ALL OF THESE THINGS- AND CLEARLY WE NEED TO BE DOING BOTH OF THESE BOTH OF THESE STEPS IF WE- IF WE PUSH PEOPLE TO DRIVE LAST WITHOUT GIVING THEM ALTERNATIVES THAT JUST CREATES PAIN FRUSTRATION- BUT IF WE DO THE FIRST STEP IN TERMS OF PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH OPPORTUNITIES WITHOUT ALSO ENCOURAGING THEM TO USE THEM THAT WOULD SORT OF WASTED THE EFFORTS- IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO I JUST WANNA AND BY POINTING TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ALL OF OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THIS IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE- ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES THAT. THAT WE'RE SEEING IT ARE THE SO CALLED DISRUPTIONS IN TRANSPORTATION- THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND LIFT- THAT ARE ARE CHANGING HOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING AROUND ON A DAILY BASIS EVIDENCE SO FAR. IS THAT THEY ARE INCREASING RATHER THAN DECREASING V. M. T. OF WHICH POINTS TO THE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THE SHARED VERSIONS OF THESE KINDS OF SERVICES- BIG QUESTION ABOUT AUTOMATED VEHICLES LOOMING OVER US IN THE FUTURE HUGE UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT WHEN- THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND HOW IT'S GONNA PLAY OUT. BUT AGAIN POINTING TO VERY LIKELY POSSIBILITIES OF THE INCREASE INCREASES IN V. M. T. AS A RESULT. SO WE'RE DOING A LOT OF WORK AT UC DAVIS TO LOOK AT THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS- AUSTIN MAY SPEAK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT- AND THINK ABOUT WHAT SORT OF POLICIES. WOULD PUSH THESE DISRUPTIONS IN A WAY THAT WILL. MINIMIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS SECOND CHALLENGE AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO TAKE ACTION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THEIR THINGS THE STATE CAN DO ITSELF- I THINK PARTICULARLY AROUND PRICING- BUT THE STATE IS ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WYS TO MOTIVATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS. A TO BE ADOPTING THE RIGHT SORTS OF POLICIES. AND THEN I WILL ADD A THIRD CHALLENGE. WHICH IS THAT WE NEED BETTER DATA AND RESEARCH- TO REALLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE STATE- AND IT'S CLEAR THAT WE- THAT THERE'S A LOT WE STILL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS WE NEEDWE NEED HELP DEVELOPING. THIRD NEW TOOLS AND METHODS- SO THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS- WE HAVE A PROJECT AT AUSTIN'S LEADING. AT UC DAVIS THAT'S LOOKING AT- HOW TO EVALUATE- THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED BY THE- G. G. R. F. WE NEED TO BE COLLECTING DATA AND EVALUATING THE STRATEGIES AS THEY ARE BEING ADOPTED- WE ALSO NEED IMPROVE METHODS AND TOOLS- WE'VE GOT SOME WORK FOR. BOTH CAR AND CALTRANS AT. THAT'S WORKING ON THIS QUESTION- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MANY OF THEM ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO IT. TOOLS IN HAND- TO DO THAT IN A IN A CONFIDENT WAY. SO I THINK THAT'S A NICE NOTED AND DONE MORE RESEARCH. VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- THAT'S MY DAD'S A PROFESSOR AND NOT ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO END YOUR ESSAYS IS TO SAY THAT THIS TOPIC RAISES THE NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH SO. OKAY WILL WILL WILL- WILL NEXT COULD ANOTHER GREAT RESEARCHER THAT PROFESSOR ROLAND HOLES TO USE FROM THE YOU SEE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS. THANK YOU A REAL MEMBERS- GOOD MORNING- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE- THIS RESEARCH WITH YOU AND- I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE SPONSOR NEXT TEN. A GOOD REMINDER THAT- NOT ONLY THE- STATE AGENCIES FOR THEIR JUSTLY CELEBRATED EFFORTS- TO SUPPORT- BETTER EVIDENCE ON CLIMATE TO KIND OF POLICY BUT ALSO PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS AND OTHER NGOS. LIKE NEXT TEN ARE ARE HELPING TO IMPROVE. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AWARENESS OF- OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE OPEN TO US- NEXT TEN- JUST TO SUMMARIZE IS A IS A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT- FOUNDATION- FOUNDED BY A NO PERRY WHO IS AN ENTREPRENEUR AND PHILANTHROPIST IN THE BAY AREA. I'M FORTUNATE TO ALSO HAVE- IS RESEARCH DIRECTOR AND CO YOU COULD TELL A WITH ME TODAY- AND AS I SAID THIS IS A GOOD REMINDER- OF THE MANY INITIATIVES THAT ARE SUPPORTING THE- DECISION MAKING ON ON CLIMB I BRING AN UPBEAT MESSAGE TODAY. I'M HAPPY TO SAY- THIS RESEARCH BASICALLY LOOKED AT THE STATE'S ASPIRATIONS FOR EASY DEPLOYMENT AS YOU KNOW- ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT IS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING BY THAT STANDARD. BUT WE ASK THE QUESTION IF- IF. THE DEPLOYMENT DID SUCCEED WHAT WOULD BE THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THIS. AND WE HAVE A VERY POSITIVE MESSAGE- FOR YOU TODAY FIRST WE CAN LOOK I'M GOING TO. SHARE WITH YOU I'VE SHARED WITH YOUR HAND OUT THAT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN PAGES LONG THE- ACTUAL REPORT IS TEN TIMES THIS LINK SO I'M GONNA GO VERY QUICKLY TO SUMMARIZE- THE MAIN FINDINGS. BUT AS I SAID- WE'VE THERE'S BEEN SOME DISAPPOINTMENT- THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY THIS MORNING- THE STATE'S NOT ATTRACTED ME TO SCHOOLS. TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE RISING AS YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE THREE- SEVEN AND- AND OTHER- LOW EMISSIONS- VEHICLE TAX ADOPTION HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE STATE'S STANDARDS. AND TO MEET THOSE GOALS IS GOING TO REQUIRE- A REALLY DETERMINE EFFORT. TO PROMOTE A DOG ON BEHALF OF BOTH THE POLICY MAKERS AND OF COURSE THE- VEHICLE SECTOR ITSELF- WE CAME UP WITH A SET OF SCENARIOS WHICH ESSENTIALLY CAPTURED- WHAT I WOULD CALL THE SORT OF STATUS QUO PERSPECTIVE IT'S EMBODIED IN CC SO LONG TERM ENERGY STRATEGY- THAT WE CAME OUT ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT- AND- WITH SOME OTHER. A RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS IN SUPPORTING CC NCCC GENERALISES GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED OUR WORK ON THIS- BUT THAT IS SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART AS OF TWO YEARS AGO AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE TECHNOLOGIES- SINCE THEN WE HAVE A MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC- TECHNOLOGY COST ESTIMATES FOR THE SECTOR. MUCH OF WHICH IS BEEN SPONSORED IN COLLABORATION WITH IDEAS AND DAVIS IS EFFORTS- TO PROMOTE RESEARCH. ON IN THE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES AND THEN WE ASK ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT ABOUT- WHAT ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF VEHICLE OWNERSHIP- THIS IS NOT WHAT WE CALL AN INCLUSIVE PROCESS BY ANY STANDARD- THE INNOVATIVE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE STILL WELL BEYOND THE REACH OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AROUND THE STATE YOU CAN SEE IN- IT THE FIGURES I THINK IT'S ON PAGE. SEVEN THE ACQUISITION OF THESE NEW VEHICLES IS DOMINATED BY- ESSENTIALLY AFFLUENT WHITE POPULATION SO FAR THE STATE'S WELL AWARE THIS SEE BRP IS NOW BEING- RETOOL TO PROVIDE A MORE INCLUSIVE. PROVIDE FOR MORE INCLUSIVE STRATEGIES- BUT STILL WE'RE SEEING- ADOPTION IN IN A RELATIVELY UNEQUAL MATTER- LARGELY BY INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT THE INCENTIVES IRONICALLY. BUT IN ANY CASE WE ASK THIS QUESTION. IN ORDER TO MEET ITS GOALS- THERE HAVE TO BE SUBSTANTIAL EDUCATION THE VEHICLE FLEET BY TWENTY THIRTY AN EVEN MORE DRAMATIC- DISPLACEMENT OF CARBON FUEL VEHICLES BY. TWENTY FIFTEEN- WE LOOKED AT THE- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF DOING THAT- ON THE KIND OF BUSINESS AS USUAL DISTRIBUTIONAL BASIS MEANING THAT. OWNERSHIP WOULD CONVERGE BY TWENTY FIFTY BUT NOT MUCH EARLIER THAN THAT AND THEN WE HAVE A SO CALLED EQUITY SCENARIO WHERE- POLICIES WHICH HAVE YET TO BE DEVISED AND WE DON'T HAVE A ROADMAP FOR THIS. THREAD WOULD ACHIEVE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE VEHICLES BY- TWENTY THIRTY. AND CONTINUE TO- INCREASE OVERALL FLEET- EVEY ADOPTION- TO TWENTY FIFTY BUT ESSENTIALLY DO SO UNIFORMLY SO THAT THERE'S A REAL TO THE EQUAL ACCESS AROUND THE STATE TO THESE VEHICLES. SIGNIFICANT SO THAT'LL BE CLEAR IN JUST A MOMENT BUT LET ME BEGIN WITH A KIND OF A PUNCH LINE- THE MOST DRAMATIC RESULTS OF THIS STUDY IS OUR DISCOVERY THAT DEVIATE OPTION IS A POTENT CATALYST FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE I CAN MAKE THIS WITH AN ECON ONE- ARGUMENTS- WE SIMPLY DEVELOP THE EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE. HOW POTENT THIS THING IS IT'S CALLED THE CANS IN MULTIPLIER. THE REASON- THAT. THERE IS A STIMULUS IN THE FIRST PLACE ARE YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE THIRTEEN. THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A VERY NICE LITTLE- DEVICE FROM THE WE- WHICH IS SITTING ON ITS WEBSITE RIGHT NOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THE COMPARES THE OPERATING COST IN TERMS OF- OF IT OF FIVE. IF YOU ENERGIES EITHER FOR CARBON FUEL OR A- GASOLINE THAT SAY. OR OR ELECTRIC TO. ELECTRIC POWER AND IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT COST ADVANTAGE TODAY. BETWEEN ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN OPERATING THE REASON THAT ISN'T TRANSLATING INTO OVERALL ECONOMIC BENEFITS IS THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE STILL TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN GASOLINE POWERED VEHICLE SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO PAY BACK THE COST DIFFERENTIAL. ACOSTA DIFFERENTIAL BY THE STANDARDS OF THE OF THE RESEARCH THAT OF THIS IS BEN I GUESS SPONSORED IN PART BUT ALSO A PROMOTED JUST THROUGH COLLEGIALITY BY IDEAS. INTO THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY COST ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT WILL REACH PARITY WITH- CONVENTIONAL FUEL VEHICLES BY THE MIDDLE OF THIS DECADE. SO THIS WON'T BE A PROBLEM ANYMORE AND THOSE COST SAVINGS THE OPERATING BECAUSE IT WAS WILL BEGIN TO KICK IN RIGHT AWAY THOSE TRANSLATE INTO AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. OF FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES OVER THE TERM AVERAGE SCHIRMER THEIR USE NINE TO ELEVEN YEARS. NOW REMEMBER THIS SIZE OF THE VEHICLE FLEET IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF CARS BEING ADOPTED REALLY I MEAN FOR DIDN'T TAKE THIS ASPIRATION SERIOUSLY. THAT'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SAVINGS FOR HOUSEHOLDS IN THE UNITED STATES. EXACTLY RIGHT EXACTLY RIGHT. FOUR THOUSAND TIMES THIRTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S REAL MONEY TODAY CALIFORNIANS SPEND OVER FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON GASOLINE. AND IF THOSE SAVINGS CAN BE REDIRECTED INTO THINGS THAT HOUSEHOLDS REALLY WANT. THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY POTENT STIMULANT. SO THIS IS THE THIS IS WHERE THE STIMULUS COMES FROM WHAT IS A GO IMAGINE pMETAPHORICALLY AND YOU TAKE A DOLLAR- THAT GAS AS A HOUSEHOLD WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT HOUSEHOLDS SPEND SERVICES. THAT MEANS THAT IF WE CAN RE DIRECT EXPENDITURE YOU'LL SEE THIS ON PAGE TWELVE. IF THE EXPENDITURE OF THOSE SAVINGS IS DIRECTED IN THE USUAL WAY REMEMBER WE ALL LIVE IN A POST INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY CALIFORNIA LIKE MOST OF THE HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD LIVES BY THE SEVENTY SEVENTY RULE. 70% OF GDP IS HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION THE HOUSEHOLD AS A PRIMARY DRIVER THE CONSUMERS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE ECONOMY. SAME IS TRUE IN CALIFORNIA LOOK AT HIGHER ACTUALLY. AND 70% OF THAT CONCEPTION IS FOR SERVICES. WE GET TO OVER TWO THIRDS OF OUR EMPLOYMENT BY GIVING EACH OTHER HAIR CUTS IN THE SERVICE OF DRINKS WE ARE LIVING IN A POST INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY. SO WHAT WE BASICALLY SEE IS THAT THE SAVINGS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. IN ENERGY SAVINGS FROM OPERATING ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL BE REDIRECTED INTO SERVICE SECTOR DEMAND. THESE ARE JOBS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE ENERGY FUEL SECTOR SORRY BUT I HAVEN'T FOUND A WAY TO DO CAR MINUTES ECONOMY THIS NOT ADVERSE TO THE FOSSIL FUEL SECTOR. I HAD TO TALK TO A JOURNALIST KERN COUNTY ABOUT THIS IT WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING BUT- THAT SECTOR'S GOING TO SUFFER THAT CAN BE. REALLY CAN'T BE AVOIDED BUT THE REST OF THE ECONOMY WILL SEE VERY STRONG STIMULUS HOW STRONG LIMóN LET'S LOOK AT THE MACRO RESULTS NOW THAT YOU KNOW- THAT I'VE EXPLAINED A MECHANISM TO YOU. LET'S LOOK AT THE MACRO RESULTS IN TWENTY THIRTY. WILL BE LOOKING A GROSS STATE PRODUCT IT'S EIGHTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER AND ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE SCENARIO. IN IT. BUT SOMEONE I'M A PAGE ELEVEN. RIGHT YEAH THE TOP TABLE ON PAGE ELEVEN YEAH I'M SORRY THIS ISN'T AN SAID THIS REPORTS I'M GOING OUT OF SEQUENCE WITH REPORTS I WANT TO GET TO THE PUNCH LINES FOR THIS WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT. 86% YEAH EIGHTY TWO BILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION OF ADDITIONAL REAL GDP AS AFTER DISCOUNTING FOR INFLATION BY TWENTY THIRTY BY TWENTY FIFTY WERE LOOKING IT OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS IN ADDED GDP BECAUSE OF THE VERSION OF EXPENDITURE FROM THE FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN. TO THE THINGS THAT HOUSEHOLDS REALLY SPEND THEIR MONEY ON. TWO THIRDS OF WHICH MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF WHICH ARE SERVICES. TO THIS CREATES BROAD BASED EMPLOYMENT IT CREATES MANY MORE JOBS. THEN THE FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN MOST OF WHICH LEAKS OUT OF THE STATE ANYWAY CALIFORNIA PRODUCES 20% OF ITS OWN OIL. BUT THE JOB CREATION EFFECT IS GOING ACROSS ALL SERVICES. AND REMEMBER THESE ARE IN STATE SERVICES THESE ARE JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUT SOURCE. SO IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DRIVER OF THE ECONOMY BUT IN FACT THAT'S THE STATUS QUO DRIVERS WILL BE EXPANDING EMPLOYMENT ACROSS ALL INCOME GROUPS. AND ACROSS ALL SERVICE SECTOR OCCUPATIONS AND ARE THESE ARE JUST LOW WAGE JOBS MEMBER SERVICES INCLUDE LEGAL SERVICES WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT LOW WAGE MEDICAL SERVICES ETCETERA. SO THIS EXPENDITURE DIVERSION THAT'S FUELED BY NOPE INTENTIONAL PUN PLEASE AT THAT IS FEEL BY. ENERGY SAVINGS FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES IF WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR OUR- OUR LUXURY VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT GOALS. WOULD BE A VERY POTENT CATALYST FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT'S THE FIRST MESSAGE THE SECOND MAIN MAJOR MESSAGE OF THE REPORT CONCERNS PUBLIC HEALTH AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE VEHICLE STONE JUST IN IN THAT CO TWO DAMMIT TOXIC CHEMICALS AND THOSE BECAUSE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. WHICH ARE MORE CONCENTRATED IN SOME COMMUNITIES THAN OTHERS AND STATE I KNOW IS WELL AWARE OF THE SO CALLED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY CHALLENGE WHICH WE ADDRESSES AS PART OF THE THIRD PIECE OF THE STUDY. BUT WE FIND THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT INTERNS REDUCING LOCAL CRITERIA POLLUTANTS THE REMEMBER THEY THEY CONSIDER TO DISCLOSE UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND AFFECTS GLOBAL WARMING WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. BUT THIS REPORT IS NOT ABOUT SAVING THE PLANET THAT'S A LOOK THAT'S A VERY LAUDABLE GOAL. THIS REPORT IS ABOUT SUBSTANTIVE MATERIAL GAINS FOR CALIFORNIANS. BOTH AND LIVELIHOODS AND IN THEIR HEALTH STATUS AND WE MONETIZE THE HEALTH STATUS IN THOSE BENEFITS ARE IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS I DON'T HAVE TIME TO COVER RECOVER ALL THE TABLES. BUT VERY SUBSTANTIAL. GAINES IN PUBLIC HEALTH JUST AS THE- RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THE WORK WE DID FOR CC SAME MESSAGE. DEPLOYING RENEWABLE ENERGY REDUCES EMISSIONS WHICH- TRANSLATES INTO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND PUBLIC HEALTH. BENEFITS AND IRONICALLY THE COST OF THE SAVINGS IN PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE OUR PS. ARE MATURE SIXTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ARE COMPARABLE TO THE COST OF BUILDING OUT THE RPF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM. SO YOU CAN JUSTIFY THAT DEPLOYMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE GAINS OF ALONE WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO GLOBAL WARMING. THE CITY AGAIN THESE ARE MATERIAL BENEFITS THE CALIFORNIANS NOT THAT NOT LET'S GO IT ALONE BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. CALIFORNIA IS DOING THE RIGHT THING ON CLIMATE. BUT THIS IS THE JUSTIFICATION THAT I THINK AN ELECTRIC CAN IMMEDIATELY. APPRECIATE WITH RELATIVELY SIMPLE ECONOMIC. CONCEPTS SO THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS IN THE BILLIONS VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND FINALLY- THANKS TO THE SUPPORTING CC AND- ALSO THE CALIFORNIA IS SO. WE'VE BUILT OUR ARE FORECASTING MODELS TO INCORPORATE THE CALVET ENVIRO SCREEN SYSTEM WHICH IS A FANTASTIC DATABASE OF VERY DETAILED- DEMOGRAPHIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE FOURTEEN WE'RE ABLE TO ASSESS THESE IMPACTS JOBS INCOMES HEALTH STATUS. ETCETERA AT THE CENSUS TRACK LEVEL. AND SO WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PRIORITY FOR THE STATE AND PAGE FIFTEEN YOU'LL SEE A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF MAKING A STINK TION BETWEEN DISADVANTAGED OR BACK COMMUNE A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND NON TAXES AND WHAT WE FIND IS PROPORTIONALLY THE JOB BENEFITS ARE GREATER FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THIS IS WHERE AN ECONOMIST WITH CALL PRO POOR THAT IS THE VIEW THE OPTION IT REGARDLESS OF WHO BY THE VEHICLES BY JUNE. TV DEPLOYMENT WILL STIMULATE THIS STATE ECONOMY IN A WAY THAT IS ESSENTIALLY PRO POOR. THE LOWEST 25% OF THE INCOME GROUP GETS 36% OF THE JOB GAINS BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE SECTOR ORIENTATION. OF THE JOB CREATION. RIGHT RIGHT AND IF THEY BUY THE CARS EVEN BETTER BECAUSE THEY'LL GET MORE THE LOCAL HEALTH BENEFITS. THAT WE'VEI'M AN ARDENT ADVOCATE AS THIS- THIS AN INCLUSIVE APPROACH TO VEHICLE POLICY. BECAUSE THE OF THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF TRANSPORT MISSIONS ARE VERY UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED RUN STATE AND I KNOW YOU'RE ALL WELL AWARE OF THAT. SO THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT THE JOBS BENEFIT. IT'S POSITIVE FOR BOOK ACROSS ALMOST ALL OCCUPATION CATEGORIES. BUT THE IN THE IN THE CASE OF THE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT IT'S AN ABSOLUTE TERMS HIGHER. BECAUSE THE BURDEN OF PUBLIC HEALTH RISK IS HIGHER IN THE LOWER INCOME TO COMMUNITIES THEY GET A LARGER ECONOMIC BENEFIT MUCH LARGER RELATIVELY BUT IN ABSOLUTE TERMSIT'S LARGER SO THOSE ARE THE MAJOR MESSAGES POTENT STIMULUS FOR THE ECONOMY IF WE CAN ACHIEVE THEM AT THIS REPORT UNFORTUNATE CAN'T TELL THE STATE HOW TO READ BUT SHE THAT. BUT NOTICE IF YOU LOOK SORRY ONE LAST POINT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MACRO RESULTS. WITCHER ON PLEASE SH STARTED DANCING AROUND. WELL THE SUMMARIZING FOR YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE MACRO RESULTS YOU'LL SEE THAT WE ESTIMATE FISCAL REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THESE SCENARIOS. AND THIS IS THE PART THESE POLICIES COULD BE QUITE LUCRATIVE FOR THE STATE UP TO EIGHTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUES THAT IT'S GOING INTO GENERAL REVENUE. SO WOULD HAVE DID YOU HAVE TO BE A WAY TO ALLOCATED BUT AS CHAIR AS CHAIR BUT I BELIEVE IS SURE ABOUT BUT THE S. IN THE BILL SAID EARLIER. THE IDEA FINANCING SOME OF THESE POLICY INITIATIVES WITH BOND. OR BARRING INITIATIVE OTHER KINDS MAKES PERFECT SENSE IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THE BENEFITS WILL BE REALIZE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. BUT THERE'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL. THE STATE REVENUE GAINS WILL BE VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR- AS A RESULT OF THE STIMULUS THAT COMES FROM- FROM DEPLOYING THESE VEHICLES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT'S THE POINT WHERE. ALRIGHT LET'S NOW TURN TO PROFESSOR AND HIS COLLEAGUES AT DAVIS AUSTIN BROWN IS DIRECTOR OF YOU SEE GIVES POLICIES TO FOR ENERGY ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMY. THANKS FOR THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING I'M AWARE WERE RUNNING A LITTLE SHORT ON TIME SO TRY TO KEEP MYSELF BRIEF THAT'S NOT A CHARACTERISTIC I'M WELL KNOWN FOR BUT I WILL DO MY LEVEL BEST- SERVICING THE POLICY INSTITUTE POLITICIANS AND PROFESSORS. BUT I THE PROBLEMS% RIGHT HAVE YOU EVER FIND PROFESSOR TURNED POLITICIAN IT'S I THINK EE SO THE POLICIES TO WHICH A DIRECT- EXISTS TO HELP CONNECT OUR RESEARCH ECOSYSTEM INTO THE POLICY PROCESS REALLY TWO MECHANISMS LIKE THIS- AND AS AS THE- SENATE BILL SAID WE TRY NOT TO. SIT ON ACADEMIC BOOKSHELVES SO OUR GOAL IS REALLY TO HELP COMMUNICATE THE RESEARCH BECAUSE SYSTEM AND BRING THAT TO MAKE IT USEFUL FOR YOU FOR YOU AND IN CONDUCTING OUR JOB. THAT'S WHERE HERE THAT'S WHY I'M HERE- AND IT'S REALLY BORN TO DO SO TRANSPORTATION HAVE DISCUSSED IN PARTICULAR HARD TO ADDRESS- AND IT'S ALSO REALLY HARD TO ADDRESS JUST FOR THE CARBON PRICE THE SIMPLE MECHANISM. A GOOD WAY TO SEE THIS IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO GET TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A TONNE CARBON PRICE WHICH NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. THAT WOULD TRANSLATE TO ABOUT A DOLLAR A GALLON GASOLINE- AND THAT'S JUST NOT A BIG ENOUGH NOW TO MOVE PEOPLE FOR SIGNIFICANTLY WE SEEN DOLLARS A GALLON SPIKES IN GAS PRICES PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IF YO PERCENT- SUCH A GOOD WAY TO SEE WHY WE HAVE THIS. ONE REASON HAVE THIS ROBUST SET OF COMPANY POLICIES TO KICKSTART SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING- SIGNAL CALIFORNIA'S LEADING ON MANY OF THESE POLICIES AS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. WE ARE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET OUR GOALS- ANDS- NEED TO BE LOOKING MUCH MORE AT- WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE- SO. AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK MORE- AGGRESSIVELY AT REDUCE OUR MISSIONS THAT WE THOUGHT WE NEED TO BEFORE NOW WITH A GOAL NEUTRALITY ON THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE TIME FRAME WHICH IS. FASTER THAN WE HAVE A LOT OF CREDIBLE STUDIES EXPLORING SO FAR I MEAN THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE GOAL BASED ON CLIMATE SCIENCE AND BASED ON ON THE HEALTH AND- CONGESTION CRISES WERE IN AS WELL- BUT WE SHOULD BE CLEAR EYED ASIDE SENATOR STARK SAID. ABOUT THE SCALE THE CHALLENGE THAT WERE FACING. UP I'M GONNA TRY TO SUMMARIZE A REALLY HUGE MATTER OF RESEARCH IN JUST A FEW POINTS AND THAT MEANS THAT. A LOT OF TELLING AT LEAST. ONE HAPPY TO WORK WITH. I WITH YOUR OFFICE IS GOING FOR DENISE THIS. SO I LIKE TO. AT HOME THE A- THE- AMATEUR CHEF AND SO I THE ABOUT ALL THESE. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT TO PUT TOGETHER AS- RECIPE'S INGREDIENTS- AND TO THE INGREDIENTS. OF A- CARBON CARBON FREE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. I THINK A PRETTY WELL KNOWN BY NOW- NOW. ARE COMMUNICATIONS PEOPLE TELL ME TO LIMIT- THE NUMBERS OF LISTS I GIVE TO. ITEMS OF THREE OR FEWER- I THINK I MEAN OPERATE IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. THERE LEGISLATORS ARE TO AT LEAST TWICE AS GOOD AT KEEPING. INFORMATION IS. THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S I'VE LIMITED MYSELF TO SIX WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE HOW WE GO WITH THAT- SO NUMBER ONE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. QUITE A BIT BEFORE AND SO I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL IS MITIGATING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND INCREASING I'M TRANSPORTATION MODE CHOICE. WITH OUR PLANNING INVESTMENT- WE TALKED ABOUT WAS. DR HANDY TALKS IN GREAT. GREAT ELOQUENCE ABOUT THE NEED TO DO THIS. AND IN PARTICULAR THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT NEW MOBILITY. A WHICH HAS BEEN RAPIDLY SERVICES LIKE UBER LIFT- ARE SHARED AND- SUPPORT. RATHER THAN COMPETE. OUT TRANSIT. ON THIS STILL I THINK HAS A HUGE ROLE EVEN IF WE OVER PERFORMING ELECTRIFICATION. AND CLEAN UP THE VEHICLES THEMSELVES WILL CALL. IN HER ON. TO CHALLENGES. YES ACCESS. HEALTH FROM ACTIVE TRADE. ALL BENEFIT FROM A MORE DIVERSE SET OF CHOICES AND GETTING BEYOND THE- SINGLE OCCUPANT CAR. ON A CULTURE- THE NUMBER. TWO IS THE FULL ELECTRIFICATION OF LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- THIS. IS A GOOD OPEN QUESTION ABOUT HOW. LONG WILL NEED. A MULTI. FUEL VEHICLES LIKE PLUG IN HYBRIDS. ON YOU CAN. FOR MORE. SO NEEDS. EVER THE SOURCE. VEHICLE MAKE IT. WE'RE SO. A BIT SLOW IN THE- CAN EVEN WE SEEN MILLION. AUGUST ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCED DIRECTIONS. OF. THE CITY VEHICLES. I'M AT THE SAME TIME. NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE TO BETTER EQUITY FOR. JUST STARTING TO SEE YOU CAR MARK. SO THE GOING TO BE REALLY OPTION GET A LOT VEHICLES INTO. THE THAT NEED MOST WHICH OF THE LOWER INCOME. THAT OFTEN DON'T. GOOD ACCESS TO TRANSFER. SERVICES AND ALSO AS AS RESTAURANT HOLE SAID WHAT WOULD BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THOSE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS OF GTTING THOSE EASE INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES. HAS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT TIME FOR THAT. USED VEHICLE MARKET. TO BE ON LIKE THE VEHICLE IS ALSO LOOKING AT FULL RECTIFICATION OF MEDIUM DUTY DELIVERY. DRAINAGE AND TRANSIT VEHICLES THESE VEHICLES HAVE DUTY CYCLES THAT ARE INCREDIBLY- WELL ALIGNED WITH ELECTRIFICATION. THEY DON'T DRIVE. TOO FAR TO BE SUITABLE FOR A BATTERY APPLICATION. AND THEY ALSO HAVE HUGE LOCAL AIR QUALITY BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY'RE OPERATING RIGHT IN THOSE MARKETS- WHICH ARE MOST VULNERABLE- THE NUMBER FOUR IS A SLIGHT CONTRAST. NEED NOT NECESSARILY FULL OF VACATION BUT AS MUCH LIKE FOR CATIONS POSSIBLE. OF LONG HAUL A HEAVY DUTY FREE VEHICLES. I THINK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THESE TEND TO HAVE LONGER DUTY CYCLES TRAVEL VERY LONG DISTANCES- AND SO- MAYBE- H. MORE CHALLENGING MARKET- AND MAY ALSO BE GOOD APPLICATION FEEL SUCH TECHNOLOGIES IF BATTERY- PROGRESS FLATTENS OUT- IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IT'S STILL POSSIBLE THOUGH THAT BATTERIES WILL BE ABLE TO TRUST THOSE IT'S JUST WE HAVE LESS CONFIDENCE IN THE MEDIUM DUTY. AND MORE LOCAL DELIVERY. ON VEHICLES. NUMBER FIVE IS THE- ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT ALL OF THESE NEWMAN. PLEASE BE ALL THESE NEW MODES. I'M SO FOR PERSONALLY OWNED VEHICLES WE KNOW THAT MOST OF CHARGING WILL BE WALL AT HOME AND WALL AT WORK. NUMBER TWO- I'M INTENSE BUT SAYING WALL AT HOME RATHER THAN AT HOME. AS WE MOVE BEYOND PEOPLE WITH GARAGES OWNING THESE VEHICLES WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. SUPPORT THEIR CHARGING WHILE THEY ARE AT HOME WITH THIS IN A MULTI FAMILY. DWELLING OR AWAY FROM THEIR- OR ON THE STREET OR WE FROM THEIR ACTUAL HOME. AND WHILE AT WORK BE ABLE TO CHARGE THERE IS A NUMBER TWO. NUMBER ONE OPTION FOR THOSE A- CHART BUT HOME. FOR PUBLIC CHARTER STILL HAS A ROLE OF FOR IMPROMPTU CHARGING AND- THE BILL SOME CONFIDENCE. ON NEARLY CHARGING. OUT ACTUAL US OF STATIONS. THAT WHEN YOU START LOOK AT THE NEW. A USE OF LIKE VEHICLES. FOR WERE ARE SEEING WITH UBER LIFT THAT MUCH HIGHER. ON CHARGING. AND SO CITIES NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THAT AND THINK ABOUT. HOW TO BUILD A CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THE GOOD APPLICATIONS OF THESE- OF THESE NEW ABILITY FLEETS AND ALLOWS THEM TO ELECTRIFY MORE RAPIDLY- THEY WOULD OTHERWISE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THIS TURNING INFRASTRUCTURE INTEGRATES WELL WITH THE GRID- AND I KNOW THIS IS BEING CONSIDERED BY SOME OTHER COMMITTEES A LEGISLATURE BUT- THINKING AHEAD ABOUT HOW TO USE. TRANSPORTATION CHARGING AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCORPORATE MORE HIGH LEVELS OF IN THE WINTER G. RATHER THAN AS A RISK FACTOR. WE CAN ACTUALLY FORGET THE POLICIES RIGHT- HELP SUPPORT OUR NEW ENERGY GOALS AND THE STABILITY THE GREAT AT THE SAME TIME AS WE MOVE TO ELECTRIFICATION. I'M IN MY FINAL. A NUMBER SIX INGREDIENT IS ADVANCED RENEWABLE LIQUID FUELS FOR THE REMAINDER AND THIS GETS TO THE- AIRCRAFT AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER AS WELL AS MARINE APPLICATIONS. THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY CHALLENGING TO- TO MOVE TO ELECTRIFICATION- FEELS MAY BE A GOOD WAY TO GET AHEAD OF THIS. AND WE NEED TO BE THINKING IN ADVANCE ABOUT SOME TRULY LOWER CARBON FUELS. THAT AREN'T REALLY IN THE MARKET YET. SO THOSE ARE SIX INGREDIENTS THIS ALSO MEANS THAT ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAT. SORT OF LOOK APPEALING AT THE BEGINNING BUT- JUST BASED ON THE- LONG TERM RESEARCH. WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGE BEING A PART OF THE FUTURE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SETS TECHNOLOGIES LIKE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES FOR LIKE TWO VEHICLES. I EVEN IF YOU GET THE MORE EFFICIENT THERE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AN DEFINITELY CAN'T CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL. AS WE BUILD. HOUSING AND INVEST IN TRANSIT WE NEED TO BE THINKING VERY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE- INVESTMENT PATTERNS WE'VE DOING. DISCUSSED A LOT SO I WILL MOVE. MOVE THROUGH THAT WOULD QUICKLY- WE ALSO NEED TO. LOOK VERY CRITICALLY AT EFFORTS TO INCORPORATE NOTHING HOUSTON TRANSPORTATION- AND THERE'S JUST NO APPLICATION OF FOSSEL GAS- OTHER THAN WITH VERY HIGH LEVELS OF CARBON CAPTURED AT A- ELECTRIC. GENERATION PLANT. THAT'S PROBABLY PERCENT REDUCTIONS- RULE MATCH GOT DOES IT DEFINITELY VIABLE LOW CARB. FUEL SPEAK SUPPORTED APPROPRIATELY BUT WILL COVER FUELS. ANDERSON CENTER THE TOTAL PLY. MUCH LOW. AND WOULD BE NEEDED JUST FOR. THE CURRENT. AFTER GAS IN A SECTORS. NO WAY FOR TO SCALE UP TO MEET. SIGNATURE PORTION PASSED. YOU'LL I'M JUST BASED ON THE RESOURCES. AND THAT'S WELL. IN NOT. AS FAR AS AN SUBJECT. REPORTS WE HAVE ON THE TOP. UNCONVENTIONAL BUT RENEWABLE WALLS AFTER FOR A VENN THE PHASE OUT THINGS START A AT THE FOR AND POTENTIAL BODY VERY BRIDGE IN THE IMPORTANT TO OF LIQUID FUEL. BUT THEY THOSE EARLY TECHNOLOGIES TO CAN'T GET TO CUSTOMERS RUSSIAN. I'M IN THE LAST WE CAN'T GO TO AUTOMATE POLICY BLIND CAN'T JUST AUTOMATE THESE. AND AS SOON SOUL OF OUR AS THE DOCTOR HAD HE SAID WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS- FROM HOW TO INCREASE THEIR BENEFITS SUPPORT POOLING SHARING ELECTRIFICATION- AND THE CLEAN MILE STANDARD ON THAT CHAIR NICHOLS MENTIONED EARLIER IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POLICY OOL HERE. OKAY SO WE KNOW ALL THOSE INGREDIENTS AND WHAT'S THE RECIPE HOW MUCH OF EACH OF THESE I DON'T THINK WE KNOW ANY OF THAT YET EXACTLY NUMBER WE DON'T HAVE TO GET STARTED I'M HAVE TO DO OUR BEST AND JUST AS WE GO ALONG BUT YOU KNOW SOME TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO FIGURE THIS ALL OUT IT'S NOT A LOT OF TIME AND- RATIFIED STATE IS MOVING FORWARD A LEADERSHIP POSITION- AND TRY TO TAKE ON THESE INCREDIBLY TOUGH. CHALLENGES THE LAST POINT I'LL MENTION IS THAT THE- YOU SEE IN SUITS OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES ARE STARTING A CONFERENCE OF FOR CAMPUS STUDY NOW- WHICH IS FUNDED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR LOOKING AT THESE COMBINED SCENARIOS FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THAT WILL BE FIRST OF KIND STUDY WE'VE NEVER HAD A- ROBUST ACADEMIC STUDY LOOKING AT A D. CONVERSATION SCENARIO THAT. AND THAT DEEP AND WHAT IS ASKED TO PROVIDE SOME. THINGS THE- I'M MISPRINT. A GOOD OUT. SLASH MORE. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE I REALLY APPRECIATE. BEING BACK HERE TO BACK CLEAN UP GHG CLEAN UP- CHAIR BELL JR ALLEN'S MEMBERS OF THIS. HEARING PANEL THIS MORNING. I AM CAIT GREEN CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. AND DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. OUR AGENCY IS THE SECOND LARGEST TRANSIT OPERATOR IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE OPERATE THE LARGEST YOUR OMISSION FLEET IN NORTH AMERICA. A FOR THOSE UP IT AS FAR AS C. T. IN GENERAL WE RE WE RE REPRESENT- TRANSIT OPERATORS AND MOST OF YOUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS. FROM NAPA VALLEY. SANTA MONICA BIG BLUE BUS VTA PART. OF ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA TRANSIT AND BART. AND SENATOR DOLLY WE WELCOME. THE TRANSIT SERVICE IN YOUR PART OF THE STATE AS WELL- I'M PLEASE HAVE IT BEEN INVITED HERE BY CHAIR BELL TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSITS ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE STATE'S RISING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. AS YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY THE STATE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH CURBING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. OR OTHER METRICS AS SENATOR DOLE HAS POINTED OUT VMT HOW YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MATTERS. SO CONGESTION. DESPITE ITS CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES ALTERNATE. MODES THE TREND IS WORRISOME. BUT LOST IN THE HEADLINES OF DECLINING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP AND OUR AFFINITY FOR OUR CARS. IS THE REALITY THAT MANY OF THE KEY STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. AND SIMPLE AND SUPPORTING PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATIONS. HAVE SELDOM BEEN PURSUED. IN CALIFORNIA. THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE AND THE ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE FROM SEATTLE PORTLAND HOUSTON AND SACRAMENTO CITIES WHERE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS RISING IS CLEAR. WE CAN TAKE CARS OFF THE ROAD AN INCREASE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP WHEN TRADITIONAL TRANSIT SERVICE IS FAST CONVENIENT FREQUENT RELIABLE AND COST COMPETITIVE. AND YOU MAY SAY GREAT THE STATE PROVIDES TRANSIT AGENCIES WITH SIGNIFICANT FUNDING NOW SO DO EXACTLY THAT. IT'S A HERE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME STRATEGIES THAT TRANSIT AGENCIES CAN AND SHOULD PURSUE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS THAT WE DAYS SIMPLY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. TRANSLATION SEES CAN CONDUCT OPERATIONAL ANALYSES TO ASSESS AND RECAST THEIR SERVICE NETWORKS BASED ON CHANGING DEMO DEMOGRAPHICS SERVICE NEEDS SHIFTING POPULATION ETCETERA. AND SEVERAL CALIFORNIA TRANSIT AGENCIES HAVE HAVE CONDUCTED ARE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES WE'VE DONE THIS IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH OUR MUNY FORWARD PROJECT REALLY WE REALIZE THAT 75% OF OUR RIDERSHIP IS ON THIRTEEN OF OUR PRIMARY ROUTES. AND YET WE OPERATE OVER HUNDRED ROUTES SO TRYING TO LOOK AT HOW TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE MORE EFFICIENTLY WHERE THE MOST DEMAND IS A KEY PART OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDING A BETTER PRODUCT. IN SAN DIEGO WITH SIMILAR WORK THEY SAW ONE POINT LAST YEAR IN SACRAMENTO A SIX POINT 35% WRITER IN IN THE QUARTER TWO NINETY. ADDITIONAL NINE LIGHT. THAT WOULD PROVIDE ON SB ONE THE STATE'S ONGOING ABOUT OF GREEN GAS FOR. FUNDS WE CAN INCREASE SERVICE LEVELS AND BE CAPACITY ADVANCE TARGETED FOR REDUCTIONS IN REHAB OUR VEHICLES. THAT IS TO MAKE THE DIRECT INVESTMENTS THAT WE KNOW WILL REDUCE EMISSIONS DIRECTLY FROM TRANSIT. AND THAT HELP MAKE TRANSIT MORE COMPETITIVE WITH AUTO TRAVEL. TO PUT A FINER POINT ON IT CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENTS IN THE TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM AND LOW CARBON TRANSIT OPERATIONS PROGRAM WHICH HAVE BEEN REFERENCED YET THIS MORNING. HAVE DIRECTLY SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CORE CAPACITY PROJECTS THE REPLACEMENT OF AGING TRANSIT VEHICLES AND INCREASE TRANSIT OPERATIONS THAT HAVE COLLECTIVELY. ENDS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT WITH THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN ZERO MISSION BUSES CALIFORNIA IS NOW ON TRACK TO HAVE ONE THOUSAND ZERO EMISSION BUSES IN OPERATIONS ON THE ORDER OF BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THIS PROGRESS IS IN KEEPING WITH CARBS INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT REGULATION AND IS MADE CALIFORNIA THE DOMINANT MARKET FOR ZERO MISSION BUSES IN THE COUNTRY AND AS A SIDE I WOULD NOTE IN THE PRESENTATION BY THE LEAD ANALYST THIS. THEY REFERENCED HOW CAN CALIFORNIA EXPORTS SOME OF THESE CONCEPTS TO BRING OTHER STATES ALONG AND ONE THING TO CONSIDER AND THIS GOES TO PROFESSOR ROLAND'S- COMMON ABOUT THE I WOULD CALL IT THE EEVEE DIVIDENDS LIKE A PEACE DIVIDEND IS CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER ZERO MISSION BUSES IN THE COUNTRY. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THERE. THREE STATE EFFORTS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA INTEGRATED TRAVEL PLAN OR PROJECT TO TRANSIT AGENCIES WILL SOON HAVE THE TOOLS TO PRESENT AN INTEGRATED. AND SEAMLESS MOBILITY. EXPERIENCE TO WOULD BE WRITERS. BUT IMPORTANTLY AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD THIS A LOT THIS MORNING THERE ARE MANY-STRATEGIES THAT MANY IF NOT MOST TRANSIT AGENCIES CANNOT PURSUE THEMSELVES AND THAT REQUIRE EXTERNAL SUPPORT TO ACCOMPLISH INCLUDING FROM YOU ALL. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE SOME OF THE TOUGHER CHALLENGES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WRESTLING WITH HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE. AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THIS MORNING THE SORT OF CONSISTENT MESSAGING AROUND THE NEED FOR PRICING. IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE A TRANSIT FIRST POLICY WHICH MEANS THAT WE CAN ADVANCE DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE TYPE OF TRADE OFFS NEEDED. IN TERMS OF THE STREET RIGHT OF WAY TO MAKE TRANSIT A PRIORITY AND THERE WAS REFERENCE EARLIER TODAY ABOUT OUR RECENT DECISION TO CLOSE MARKET STREET AND IF YOU'VE BEEN TO SAN FRANCISCO YOU KNOW THAT MARKET STREET IS. OUR MOST IMPORTANT DOWNTOWN CORRIDOR IN JANUARY WE ELIMINATE ALL PRIVATE AUTOMOBILES ON MARKET STREET WE SEE TWO HUNDRED BUSES PER HOUR DURING THE PEAK. AND MANY TRAVEL TIMES HAVE IMPROVED BY 12% SINCE JANUARY I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN I WALK ON MARKET STREET NOW. IT'S AND IT'S YES THERE ARE NO PRIVATE CARS- YES WE'VE REMOVED. UBER AND LIFT. BUT WHAT PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED ON IS HOW QUIET IT IS. IT'S ACTUALLY AN INCREDIBLE SHIFT IN AN EXPERIENCE AS A PEDESTRIAN. OR AS A MODE USER YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR BIRDS AT THIS POINT ON MARKET STREET WHICH IS REALLY INCREDIBLE. HOWEVER IN MOST CALIFORNIA CITIES BUSES LIGHT RAIL VEHICLES ARE FORCED TO OPERATE IN MIXED TRAFFIC. MEANING THAT WHEN THERE ARE TRAFFIC DELAYS ON THE ROADWAY DUE TO AN ACCIDENT TRAFFIC LIGHT TRANSIT IS LOADED PUSHED OFF SCHEDULE. THIS REALITY IS THE RESULT OF DECISIONS MADE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO GOVERN THE RIGHT OF WAY AND WHO ARE OFTEN THOUGH NOT ALWAYS DIVORCED FROM HER TRANSIT AGENCIES. ACTIONS TO CREATE BUS ONLY LANES. SUCH AS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND DEMOCRATIC DEDICATED RIGHT OF WAY LIKE LA METRO SILVER AN ORANGE LINES. OR TRAFFIC LIGHT PRIVATIZATION FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM HEAD ON BY GIVING TRANSIT VEHICLES TRAVEL PREFERENCE OVER SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES. IN DOING SO THEY IMPROVE ON TIME PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MAKING TRANSIT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO WOULD BE WRITERS. AND TRANSIT AGENCIES EXPECT THAT CHAIRMAN BILLS BUS ON SHOULDER LEGISLATION. COULD DELIVER SIMILAR BENEFITS TO COMMUTER BUSES OPERATING ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. HOWEVER THERE IS THEN LAND USE AND HOUSING. SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE PUT INTO PLACE THE FRAMEWORK FOR LINKING LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION DECISION MAKING BUT IT LACKS THE FUNDING SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE STICK TO ENSURE THAT REGION'S CAN COMPLY WITH THEIR OWN PLANS AND TARGET SETTING. WHAT RESULTS AND THIS IS BORNE OUT BY THE DATA PUBLISHED RECENTLY BY A RP IS THAT SPRAWL WHICH IS INHERENTLY CHALLENGING FOR TRANSIT TO PERFORM WELL ACROSS. CONTINUES TO CONSUME OUR STATE AND OUR STATE. AND OUR RELIANCE ON AUTUMN ABILITY BECOMES MORE AND MORE ENTRENCHED. AT THE SAME TIME OUR STATE CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH HOUSING AFFORDABILITY HAS SUBURBANITES PROPERTY PUSHING ONE SCORE TRANSIT RIDERS AWAY FROM THE CITY CENTERS WERE TRANSIT IS A PRACTICAL OPTION. TO AREA OF THE STATE WHERE THE ONLY REASONABLE OPTION FOR COMMUTING IS THE CAR. ACCORDING TO A JUST RELEASED UC ITS STUDY ON BAY AREA TRANSIT TRENDS AND I COMMEND THIS TO YOU- AS A REALLY GREAT CONCISE IN ITS POLICY BRIEF SUMMARY ON THE TRENDS THAT ARE IMPACTING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. MORE THAN THREE AND FIVE BAY AREA WORKERS NOW LIVE AND WORK IN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH RELATIVELY POOR TRANSIT ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT. WHAT'S MORE WE ARE NOW SEEING THAT FEWER BAY AREA RESIDENTS LIVE AND WORK IN THE SAME CITY. AND THAT COMMUTE DISTANCES FOR ALL BAY AREA WORKERS HAVE INCREASED. IF WE ARE TO STEM THE TIDE OF RISING BMT AND TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS WE NEED TO CONFRONT THESE CHALLENGES HEAD ON. BY DISCOURAGING SPRAWL SUPPORTING AFFORDABLE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IN AN IN ACTING ANTI DISPLACEMENT POLICIES. FINALLY THERE'S PRICING AS SECRETARY KIM STATED SO WELL AND UNEQUIVOCALLY THIS MORNING IT MATTERS. IT'S A BIT REDUCTIVE BUT WHEN COMMUTERS HAVE THE OPTION OF TAKING A TRANSPORTATION AND UBER A LIFT FOR FIVE DOLLARS OR A BUS WITH TRANSFERS FOR THREE DOLLARS. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THOSE WITH MEANS CHOOSE THE FORMER. WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT PRICING OUR TRANSPORTATION MODES TO BETTER INTERNALIZE THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ASSOCIATED. IF WE LEAVE OUT. GGG AND CONGESTION. REDUCE REDUCING THESE WE OUGHT TO APPLY A COST TO THAT AND BAKE IT RECIPE INTO THE PRICE OF CHOOSING A SINGLE OCCUPANCY CAR. VERSUS TRANSIT WHILE ALSO BEING CAREFUL TO CONSIDER THE EQUITY EQUITY IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH POLICIES. AND TO SEIZE PLANET PLANNED AREA TWENTY FIFTEEN BLUEPRINT DOES THIS WELL BY CONSIDERING ALL LANE FREEWAY TOLLING FOR DISCOUNTS FOR CAR POOLING LOW INCOME DRIVERS AND OFF PEAK TRAVEL. ON QUARTERS WITH BART AND CALTRAIN ALTERNATIVES. AND BY THE SAME TOKEN WE MUST REEVALUATE PARKING WHETHER IT'S FREE OR CHEAP STREET PARKING OR PARKING MINIMUMS WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND REALIZE THAT WE PASSIVELY ENCOURAGE THE USE OF AUTOMOBILES BY MAKING THEM TO CHEAPER TO CAN BE AND TOO CONVENIENT. IN CLOSING CALIFORNIA TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE PROUD OF THE VITAL ROLE WE PLAY AND WILL CONTINUE AND MUST PLAY IN ADDRESSING THE STATE'S RISING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. I HOPE MY COMMENTS HERE TODAY LEAVE YOU WITH A LASTING IMPRESSION THAT TO BE SUCCESSFUL TO REALLY REDUCE THE M. T. AND CONGESTION TRANSLATIONS HE'S WILL REQUIRE THE SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP OF ALL ENTITIES. THAT GOVERN OUR STATE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. YEP YEP GIVE THE GREEN. WELL THE TOWN QUESTIONS THOUGHTS FROM THE MEMBERS. NOT SURE ABOUT- ONE OF ONE OF THE STRATEGIES- TO GET MORE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP OF WOULD BE TO. THERE IS SOME KIND OF EXTREME FAIR DISCOUNT PROGRAM IN OUR STAND SACRAMENTO. TRANSITION SEE- HAS BEEN GIVING TRANSIT PASSES TO. STUDENTS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS IS THERE IS THERE. A RIDERSHIP INCREASE WHEN THE TRANSIT DISCOUNT FAIRER YOU KNOW LIKE THE GIVE TRANSIT PASSES SOME PLACES THE GIVEN FOR FREE THEY GET THEY GIVE HERE'S YOUR PAST YOU HAVE A BASS YOU. CAN CUT AND RIDE TRANSIT AND THEN THE OTHER THE OTHER STRATEGY ON THE OTHER HAND ON TRANSIT DISCOUNTS IS TO HAVE THE EMPLOYER PROVIDE ALL THEIR- EMPLOYEES WOULD TRANSIT PASSES ARE THOSE KINDS OF OPTIONS- DO THEY HAVE AN IMPACT ON. A RIDERSHIP AND TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS INTO FOR THE WE'VE SAID. WELL SO I WOULD SAY- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF IN GENERAL OF ALL PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE TRANSIT AND ENCOURAGE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP WHETHER IT'S THROUGH EMPLOYERS OR USE PASSES ON IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST ROBUST FREE MUNY FOR LOW INCOME YOUTH SENIORS AND DISABLED RESIDENTS. AND THROUGH THAT PROGRAM WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE ON RIDERSHIP AMONG STUDENTS USING MUNY- I THINK THE KEY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE IDEAS I HAVE IS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO KINDERGARTEN SHOULD GET A TRANSIT PASS. IT SHOULD BE HOW WE BRING ALONG GENERATION OF WRITERS BUT THE KEY IS TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW WE PAY FOR THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ON THIS AS A AS AS A AS A PROGRAM THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT. ALL THAT THE CALL THAT. HE I IT IS INSURANCE OUR PROGRAM I JUST AS FREE. COST US TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR JUST A STRAIGHT UP THAT COMES OUT OF OUR OPERATING BUDGET- WE HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE IN SAN FRANCISCO TO HAVE A SORT OF OUR OPERATING BUDGET SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND OF THE CITY AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO. I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OTHER OPERATOR IN CALIFORNIA HAS THAT AND SO AS WE LOOK TO THESE. PUSH AND PULL LEVERS AROUND PRICING. FOR EXAMPLE IF E'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT CORDON PRICING OR CONGESTION PRICING MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO SUPPORT. THE PRICING THAT WE NEAR THE OF THE FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THESE KINDS OF PROPOSALS UNDER. THE COMMENT. ASKING PROFESSOR OF ROLEN HOPES THE WHOLE STE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT- REACHING THIS PARITY ON- EVEY. PURCHASING PER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY AND WE HAVE WE HAVE A PROGRAM NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR LOW INCOME FOR OUR FOLKS SAID CARS FOR ALL THAT WE WANT WE HAVE A DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO PURCHASING- E. V. MY- VEHICLES. IS THAT REALISTIC BASED ON YOUR RESEARCH ME SEEMS LIKE A NICE PROGRAM. OR COULD THAT MONEY BE SPENT BETTER- IN THE SHORT TERM RATHER THAN THE LONG TERM I WOULD CERTAINLY ADVOCATES- SHORT TERM COMMITMENTS AND I'M VERY CONCERNED THIS BAG I. I CERTAINLY SHARE THE CONCERN THAT WAS EXPRESSED ABOUT THE- DOWNWARD- ADJUSTMENT- IN C. B. R. P. RESOURCES POTENTIAL DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS VIA THE RESOURCES BECAUSE I THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE DOUBLING DOWN RIGHT NOW AND- AS I. INDICATED OUR PROJECTIONS OF THE BE VERY SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE DIVIDENDS- AS A RESULT OF THE GROWTH STIMULUS SO THE STATE COULD GET THIS MONEY BACK IF IT HAS A LONG TERM FINANCING SCHEME. THAT WOULD ENABLE THAT AS FAR AS THE DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS YES I AM PERSONALLY AN ADVOCATE OF A MORE INCLUSIVE APPROACH TO- TO THESE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK THIS STATE. COULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE TERMS OF ACQUISITION FOR THESE VEHICLES FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE BECAUSE IT REALLY IS TO FIX COST THEY'LL BENEFIT PROPORTIONALLY MORE FROM THE FUEL THINGS BECAUSE- THAT'S EVERY YOU KNOW IT'S THE SAME COST PER GALLON. FOR EVERYBODY WHO DRIVES A GUESS MY QUESTION IS AS AN ECONOMIST WE HAVE. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED A BUDGET THAT REDUCES THE C. B. R. P. FOUR HUNDRED. AND TWENTY WE'VE GOT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE 30% OF THAT HAS TO GO TO LOW INCOME FOLKS SO THAT REDUCE. THE AMOUNT EVEN MORE. TO IN THIS OTHER ENOUGH LIKELY VOTER. GIVEN THE NINETY FIVE DOLLAR INCENTIVE. GIVEN EVERY ALL THE OTHER STRAINS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TODAY TO PARTICIPATE MAY I GUESS WE'LL KNOW AT THE END OF THE YEAR WILL KNOW IT IT'LL DEPEND ON YOUR CONSTITUENCY OF COURSE RIGHT BUT- I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUST VERY STRONG JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TRYING TO MAKE THESE VEHICLESMORE ACCESSIBLE- AS SOON AS WE COULD DO THAT AND YOU THE FOLLOWING IS NECESSARY TO DO IT AND AS I SAID I THINK THE STATE SHOULD REALLY BE DOUBLING DOWN INCENTIVES. ACROSS THE BOARD BUT PARTICULARLY IN THOSE CATEGORIES- THEY'RE- UNDERSERVED BY THESE- BUT IT'S TECHNOLOGIES AND NEED THE BENNETT THIS LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AND EVEN THE FUEL SAVINGS BENEFITS WILL MEAN MORE TO THEM AND SAYS SO I JUST I REALLY THINK. THE STATE SHOULD RECONSIDER- AND THINK ABOUT MAKING A MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT TO INCENTIVES BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY'LL BE PAID BACK OVER THE MEDIA. IN THE LONG TERM BY TWENTY FIFTY THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT AND EVEN YOU KNOW EVEN IF WE REACH PARITY IN TERMS OF COST PREDICTING TECHNIQUE BUDGET OPTION IT IS A FOOL'S GAME IT'S REALLY HARD- WE DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE THE DOOR WE- A CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES AND NOT OTHERS BUT- IT'S CLEAR THAT. WE NEEDED SOMETHING IT'S LIKE AN IPHONE ON WHEELS THIS HAS TO BE A CONSUMER GOOD THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU CAN GET PEOPLE TO BUY YOU THESE BY GUILT TRIPPING ABOUT THE CLIMATE. YOU CAN DO IT BY GET SHOWING THEM LONG LISTS OF ACCOUNTING NUMBERS ABOUT PAY BACK THEY HAVE TO DESIRE THESE THINGS AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW TEXAS SEEMS TO BE GAINING MOMENTUM NOW WHICH IS A GOOD SIGN- THE OTHER BELIEVE ME WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE OR THE OTHER. ESPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL PRODUCES BOOK INSTITUTE TO WELL RIGHT IS IT LIKE VEHICLES BY THE NECK TO YOUR- AND WE'LL SEE UP TO THIRTY FORTY AS YOU'LL SEE IN THIS REPORT IN SURVEY OF MERGING OF VEHICLES CHOICE. W. PARITY AND THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS PRIDE VARIETY SO I HOPE THAT THIS WILL AS A RESULT OF THE PUZZLE ABOUT WHY. DUSTING THESE VEHICLES TO SHARE BRING YOU INDICATED THAT. THE THAT THOU IN ET BUT IS. YES SOME OF. MANY OF THEM ARE PRODUCER CAL. HAS A BONA AFFECT OUTSIDE THE- TO SAY CAL WE HAVE PROVIDED. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO- HAVE A BUS IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S BUT SOME WHAT. WHAT MIGHT WHAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IN ORDER TO GET THAT TO SCALE ON A NATIONAL LEVEL TO. I MEAN I THINK THERE IS AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE WORK WITH THE CARBS INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANS REGULATION WE- THEY CAME TO UNDERSTAND I THINK THE LIMITATIONS OF THE INDUSTRY TO SCALE UP. LIKE THERE IS THIS% GETTING UP TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN PRODUCE ENOUGH OF THE VEHICLES THAT THE DEMAND IS GOING TO BE FOR. SO I THINK THE MORE THAT WE CAN ADVANCED SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURERS- TO SUPPORT PRODUCTION. OF THAT WOULD BE ONE APPROACH- I WOULD BE HAPPY- TO ROGER WAS MORE INFORMATION ON THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION- IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. MMHM YEAH. THANK YOU PAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE REACHING THAT WITCHING HOUR AND WHEN WE WILL HAVE A COUPLE FOLKS ON MAKES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT THIS IS THIS IS FANTASTIC AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION FOR US TO WORK OFF OF THE FOR VITIS WITH TODAY SIR THANK YOU. OKAY WERE TO BRIEFLY GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT I KNOW A LOT OF THEM JUST TO HAVE THEM GET GONE SO LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM FOLKS. GREETINGS MY NAME IS JEFF HARDY KIA. VERY INTERESTED IN TRANSPORTATION- JUST PARTICIPATED RECENTLY IN SAY COG LOOKING AT HOW THE COMMUNITY SERVER. SO REMINDER IS. ON PUTTING THE BRAKES ON RISING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. WE SEE THAT IT'S OPEN SOURCE. TRAFFIC CONGESTION I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU THAT THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING BECOMING IN THE MANDATES OF YOUR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THAT IS A SINGLE THING THAT AFFECTS MOST PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ES EVENS LOS ANGELES HAS HAD TO COMMENT ABOUT THAT REPEATEDLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOW DISMANTLING THEIR RAPID TRANSIT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T PUT THE SIGNAL ENHANCEMENTS AND OTHER THINGS THE DEAL WITH CONGESTION SINGLE GREATEST THING. SECOND THING I WILL OFFER TO YOU IS I'M GOING TO SUGGEST TO YOU IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE- ABILITY. OF NATURAL GAS AS A TAX REVENUE SOURCE DO NOT EXEMPT TRANSIT OR AGENCIES FROM IT SO THAT YOU CAN FIND THIS CHANGE OVER BECAUSE YOU REPEATEDLY SAY YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR IT. SO AGAIN FOR PUTTING THE BRAKES ON IT I WILL SAY TO YOU YOU'VE NOT DONE ENOUGH OF DEALING WITH CONGESTION. REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT SO THAT WILL ASSIST YOUR WRITER YOUR INDIVIDUAL I'M GIVE ME TO BE PUSHING ON THE ON THE SHOULDER BECAUSE THAT IS A TRANSPORTATION. THE ABILITY BUT THE OTHER THING IS FIGURING OUT HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE OUT OF CARS I WISH YOU TRAIN GUY WAS HERE BECAUSE WITH THE FACT THAT ANOTHER TEN YEARS WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE CLIMATE. CHANGE TO ANOTHER TEN DEGREES WHICH MEANS AVIATION IS GOING TO BE DRASTICALLY IMPACTED SO WE CAN TRAIN RIDES ARE GOING TO BE THE MEANS OF MOVING UP AND DOWN. CALIFORNIA OKAY THANK YOU. YES SIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN MR MEMBERS BRIAN WHITE HERE ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO AREA COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS ALSO KNOWN AS A COG WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AS WE REPRESENT TWENTY TWO CITIES IN SAID COUNTIES WITHIN URBAN RURAL AND SUBURBAN DISTRICTS WE HAVE RESPONDED LOCALLY TO THE EMERGING AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES BY ADOPTING A PILOT PROGRAM. THAT SEEKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY 19% AND FIFTEEN YEARS EACH OF OUR JURISDICTIONS HAVE IDENTIFY PROJECTS TO INCREASE INFILL DEVELOPMENT REDUCE VEHICLE MILE TRIPS TRANSIT RIDERSHIP ANALECTS FUND LET'S FIND REMAINING TRIPS THIS IS KNOWN AS OUR GREEN MEANS GO PROGRAM WHICH ALSO TARGETS OF. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH OUR HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THOSE ARE EVEN WITH SB THREE SEVEN FIVE IN STATUTE WHICH REQUIRES COUNTS OF GOVERNMENTS TO REACH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION LAND USE ME HOW THEY ARE GOING TO MEET THE REGION IN TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING NEEDS HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE WITH THE NEED OF FUNDING UNFORTUNATELY NOT MUCH OF OUR NEED OF FUNDING PROGRAMS AND GRANTS ARE LYING TO THREE SEVEN FIVE BECAUSE THEY WERE DONE POST THREE SEVEN FIVE. IN ON US AND AN UNNECESSARILY TO MEET THESE AMP IMPLEMENTATION GOALS WE NEED TO LINE SB THREE SEVEN FIVE TWO ARMIES GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO. PRESS THIS WE ARE. YOU KNOW THE REASON. TO THIS 9% GOA WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT BOTH HOUSING PRODUCTION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS ARE NOT. MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. SO IN SHORT WE THINK THE SACRAMENTO REGION WE'RE REALLY ON THE EPICENTER BECAUSE WE HAVE A PLAN THAT IS THE FIRST ONE OUT THE DOOR. AXE AXE ACCESS TO MEET THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING EVEN WITH THESE PROGRAMS ARE OUT THERE. HAVE TO ALIGN WITH SB THREE SEVEN FIVE AND WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE YOUR COMMITTEE. MISTER CHAIR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE INSPIRATION EVERYBODY TO TALK ABOUT HOW. SACRAMENTO REGION IS REALLY AT THE CUSTOMER FOR TRYING TO TALK ABOUT LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NEXT. FEDERAL CASKEY CRITICAL STAFF ABOUT. UP COMMITTEES MANY MISTER FULL BORE I'M WHICH SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT CENTER BILL HAD JUST LAUGHED BUT WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. BECAUSE OF THE FREE FAIR PASSES BUT WE WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE AND FUNDED THROUGH TO CITY SACRAMENTO. A SOURCE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WE DID GET UP TO SEVENTY PERCENT. AND IN JANUARY HUNDRED FIVE PERCENT. INCREASE IN STUDENT RIDERSHIP. NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE NOT EXISTING IN A VACUUM WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE PARTNERS NAMELY. CALISTO CARB CTC CALTRANS WE EXISTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THESE ENTITIES AND THEY HAVE. AND THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A VERY STRONG- INVOLVEMENT IN MAKING SURE THAT THE POLICIES. IN THESE DECISION MAKING BODIES WHEN YOU. ALLOCATE GRANTS WEDNESDAY HOLD OUR AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE BUT THEY PLEASE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR TRANSIT AGENCIES AND DELIVERING THESE CRITICALLY NEEDED. TRANSIT PROJECTS IN SACRAMENTO WHEN WE HAVE SUBURBAN SPRAWL NOW ARE AGENCIES INNER CITIES ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US. ON TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEING THAT SOCCER T. S. MOVING THE NEEDLE FORWARD. IN NOT ONLY MEETING. THE BURNERS ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY GOALS BUT ALSO IMPROVING THE CLIP YOU FLOOR. CREASE THIS IS. GETTING STATE. TO A NEUTRAL OPEN FOR KAREN SACK SO. AND BUT COMMITTEE TO WORK WITH US AND ALSO THANK YOU YOUR TIME KEEP. THANK YOU NEXT. HELLO MY NAME IS JULIE JORDAN LEADERS COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND IT KIND. FOR A LOOK A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND WE WORK WITH SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY RESIDENTS- WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND REALLY. BRING TOGETHER KIND OF THIS INTERSECTION OF CLIMB IN TRANSPORTATION- IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR MORE COORDINATION IN THIS AREA OF WITH THE LEGISLATURE AGENCIES. AND LOCAL AND REGIONAL JURISDICTIONS- AND AS MANY OF TALKED ABOUT ALREADY SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS CLEARLY RIGHT AN ATTEMPT TO DO THAT WASN'T A TIME TO DO THAT AND WE HAVEN'T REACH THOSE GOALS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S ALSO AND WHAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS REALLY THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A STRONG EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENT ON CLIMATE JUSTICE COMMITMENT- OR POLICY APPROACH IN THE TRANSPORTATION SPACE. AND YOU KNOW I HEARD THE PROFESSORS FROM UC DAVIS DISCUSS THIS TO SOME DEGREE- BUT IT IS WHAT WE SEE ON THE GROUND IN COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK WITH. REALLY KIND OF COOL UNMET NEEDS IN TERMS BASIC MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE CLEAN VEHICLES AND- NEEDS IN TERMS OF LAND USE POLICY ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED AND RURAL COMMUNITIES- IN PARTICULAR THE DISADVANTAGE UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES. HAS ALL THOSE JUST IT WAS BEYOND JUST SORT OF PERSON LOCAL OWNERSHIP RATE A LOT OF BOOKS WE WORK WITH STILL ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THESE. ELECTRONIC VIEW- ELECTRIC VIEW THOSE WITH THE REBATES. SO JUST PLAN TO POINT OUT THAT REALLY ALL POLICIES. PRIORITIES PRACTICES IN. WERE MAKING A TRANSFER HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A CLIMATE JUSTICE APPROACH. THAT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT REDUCING GHGS AND THE EMPTY. BUT ALSO ADDRESSING LOCAL AIR QUALITY ACCESSIBILITY SAFETY MOBILITY JUSTICE AND GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY. AND ONE THING THAT INCLUDES IS MOVING IN PART BE ON PILOT PROGRAM SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS A SINGLE TRANSFER TAKEN TATIAN EQUITY PROGRAM A CAR BUT REALLY. KIND OF A PROMISING SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE KIND OF A GREAT PROGRAM. BUT WE REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT INSTITUTIONALIZING PROGRAMS AND FUNDING PRACTICES THAT REALLY DIRECTLY SUPPORT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND THOSE HAVE REALLY BEEN DIS INVESTED IN AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL COST OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM- SO LASTLY I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THIS KIND OF CLIMATE JUSTICE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE APPROACH TO TRANSPORTATION. ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE HEAVY DUTY AND GOODS MOVEMENT SO THAT CAME UP SOMEWHAT TODAY BUT- WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT FULLY ZERO MISSION- NEAR ZERO IS NOT ENOUGH FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY. WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT TRAFFIC THEIR HOMES WERE TALKING THAT IN THE TRUCKS PER LOCAL LAND USE POLICY THAT'S GOING TO SUPPORT. CLIMATE AND EQUITY GOALS SO. HOW MUCH TIME. Q. X. THANK YOU CENTER WHERE HOUSE SKI STEP MY FOR US HAS BEEN VERY FORM HEARING LIKE TO JUST SORT OF EMPHASIZE THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF THE PANELISTS TODAY IS- AS WELL AS FROM- SOME OF THE SANDERS- IS THAT THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED FOR STABLE PREDICTABLE MULTI YEAR- AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASED FUNDING THAT WE'VE PUT A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE G. G. R. F. AS A SOURCE FOR MOST GHG REDUCTION PROGRAMS. EVEN IF UNDER RULES THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE SIZE OF THAT POOL OF MONEY I'D STILL POTENTIALLY IN ORDER TO A MAGNITUDE TOO LOW TO REALLY ADDRESS THE SCALE OF THIS ISSUE- INTERVIEW IN ADDITION TO LOOKING AT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET RESTORING THE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THOSE PROPOSED TO BE CUT BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO REALLY CONSIDER SCALING UP AND GOING MUCH LARGER- AS WAS PROPOSED BY THE ECONOMIST ON THE LAST PANEL- TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS A REAL PLUS. A FEW WITH CLEAR MONETARY HEALTH AND CLIMATE RETURNS FOR THE- A GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER CASKEY AND ESTEEM STAFF I MY NAME IS LINDA COMMISSION I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION- WE ARE INTERESTED INVESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE. A HEALTHY AFFORDABLE AND THAT BICYCLING IS A PART OF THE EQUATION. IN TRANSFORMING OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR OUR OUR SYSTEM TO BE SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO GET AROUND TO PEOPLE TO MOVE I THINK THE BIG. DISCUSSION HERE TODAY EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SENDING IT ON REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHICH A LOT OF SOLUTIONS AND HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. IN ADDITION TO A AND IT'S TENSION TO THE FUNDING THAT. IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO ALSO CENTER OUR DISCUSSION ON WHAT IS A TAKE TO MOVE MORE PEOPLE MORE OF THE TIME. AND NOT JUST TO A YES WE NEED TO CLEAN UP OUR OUR FLEET MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CLEAN. OF VEHICLES BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT MOBILITY IS A RIGHT FOR PEOPLE AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SAFELY. AND INACCESSIBLE WICKETS IT'S A WAY THAT YOU ARE A MAKING SURE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO JOBS ACCESS TO RESOURCES. TO OPPORTUNITY. IT'S ALSO FOR AT IS GLAD. WE'VE A DESIGN AND A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OUT OF OUR LIVES BY BEING IN THE CAR MORE OF THE TIME. SO WE HAVE TO REDESIGN HOW WE GET AROUND SO THAT WE CAN. IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AS WELL SO FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT IS PUT INTO A BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE YOU GET TO AN IT TO WAS IN A- SENSE BY. CAN HELP US IT CENTER WE THE IF WE'RE LOOKING FROM OF. SO FIRST THE- I'D AND. FOR BIKING AND WALKING SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT JUST BUILDING PIECE MEAL. A BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE THE BIKE LANE ENDS OR THE PROTECTED BY CLINT ENDS AND THEN THE PERSON DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHERE TO GO BUT THAT THERE'S A NETWORK THAT CAN ACTUALLY GETS PEOPLE TO PLACES- CONTINUE. TO EXPAND AND INVEST IN BIKESHARE- ONE OF THE- THE- PROGRAMS THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS THE EQUITY SUITE OF PROJECTS OUT AND THROUGH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION SO THAT. FOR EXAMPLE CLEAN MOBILITY OPTIONS AND ALSO CLEAN OURS FOR ALL- AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR AYE CASKEY. IS ACTUALLY AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM TO HELP TO TAKE CARS OFF THE ROAD THAT ARE POLLUTING AND- AND HELP TO GIVE BACK REBATES TO FOLKS TO GET OTHER OPTIONS- ENDING SUBSIDIES FOR DRIVING. LOOKING AT CONGESTION PRICING MECHANISMS AND THEN ALSO AS WAS MENTIONED HERE TODAY ENDING A ROAD EXPANSION PROJECTS ARE SEVERELY REDUCING HOW. WE DO TRANSPORTATION PLANNING TODAY INSTEAD OF BUILDING THE FUTURE BUILDING THE TRANSPORTATION AT SYSTEM OF THE PAST WE LOOK AT WHAT WHAT TYPE OF FUTURE THAT WE NEED AND I'D LEAVE. A QUOTE FOR YOU TODAY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS MENTIONED BY LEWIS MUMFORD ALMOST SEVENTY YEARS AGO. BUILDING MORE ROADS TO PREVENT CONGESTION IS LIKE A FACT AND LOOSENING HIS BELT. FRIENDS BE E. IN OVER STE WE'RE CREATING MORE SPACE BUT- YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE ISSUE SO THANKS FOR THE- THANK YOU NEXT. I DO NOT A GOOD QUOTE- TERESA COOK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION A ONE I THINK I THOSE OF YOU UP THE DíAS I'M FOR THE GOOD DISCUSSION TODAY AND FOR STAFF AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO BEING AS I'M TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AS POSSIBLE ON I ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN PARTICULAR SO THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION IS A GROUP COMMITTED TO SEEING HIGHER USAGE- AND BROADER USAGE OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN WILL USE TO SUPPLY IT. I'M ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HAD A LOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE SCHOOLS WERE ALREADY A PART OF MANY OF THEM WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO OFFER I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF GAPS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY THE SPEAKERS TODAY AND HEARD BY THOSE OF US IN THE AUDIENCE OF HOW WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THE PENETRATION LEVELS THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WE NEED I THINK SOMETIMES THERE'S A TEN. TO SORT OVER THE FUEL CELLS PLAY AND MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING THESE TO COMMITTEES TO REALLY MAKES THAT YOU KNOW WERE WORK WERE COVERING GAP AND GET DEPEND LEVELS THAT WE KNEW TO ORDER TO MEET STATE'S GOAL. ARE TO THE CA THAT OUR UNSURE BY THE ACADEMIC AND ALL AND THE VERY AND I'M SURE OF IT I AM NOT AS MAKE IT BE USED IN HYDROGEN FUEL. THERE'S KIND OF A WIN WIN OFF A OUR IN CAL. HI LIMIT. IN YET DON'T HAVE ROGER IS THEY DON'T HAVE A- TO A CHARGING. OR WORKPLACE CHARGING A AN ISSUE THAT'S A PLACE IN A SPACE THAT WERE REAL HOPING TO MAKE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES. A MORE FRIENDLY AND MORE VIABLE OPTION FOR THEM SO WITH THAT BEING SAID THANK YOU AGAIN AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE TWO COMMITTEES ON THESE ISSUES FURTHER. THANK YOU NECKS. GOOD AFTERNOON- KATHY VAN AUSTIN NVM STRATEGY GROUP REPRESENTING UNITED AIRLINES AND- WAS TOUCHED ON JUST A COUPLE OF. TIMES IN THE HEARING TODAY ABOUT AVIATION AND COMMERCIAL AVIATION. AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A MOVEMENT THAT- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE COALITION OF OVER A HUNDRED ENTITIES. TO TRIED TO DEVOTE HELPED DEVELOP THE MARKET FOR SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL- WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING SOUTH AND TO THE LC OFF US A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND THAT IS HOLE- IT HAS TRIGGERED INVESTMENT INTO EXPANSION FOR ARE ONLY STATE. ARE ONLY FACILITY CURRENTLY IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S PRODUCING SELF ON A DAILY COMMERCIAL BASE US- BUT WHAT WE DO NEED IS WE NEED SOME PARTNERSHIP FROM THE STATE- THIS IS A DROP IN FUEL THE DEMAND IS THERE THE AIRLINES WANTED BOTH. DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL- BUT WE DO NEED SOME ASSISTANCE WITH IN SOME INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A- OF A- BASICALLY BUDGET ASK TO TRY TO HELP BUILD OUT SOME INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN GET. THE FUEL FROM POINT A TO POINT B. AND INCENTIVIZE THIS MARKET ALSO DEAL WITH SOME OF PRICE DISPARITY. RIGHT NOW IT WE IF THE STATE CAN INVEST THE- SOME SOME REVENUE INTO INFRASTRUCTURE WE THINK BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WITH THE 5% UP TAKE AND SELL OFF. OF THAT WE CAN REDUCE. EMISSIONS BY TEN MILLION METRIC TONS ANNUALLY SO THAT'S JUST WHAT 5% OUR GOAL IS TO GET 250% SOUTH USE BY TWENTY FIFTY- SO WE'LL BE TALKING WITH YOU FURTHER ABOUT THAT BUT WE DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T REALLY SET EMISSIONS FOR US I MEAN THAT'S A FEDERAL PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY. BUT BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS INVEST IN WITH WHAT IS THE FUTURE IT'S THE REALLY THE ONLY WAY THAT WILL HAVE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS. AND THANK YOU NEXT. BUT AFTERNOON SENATOR BUDGET MCALLEN FROM AT ALL SINGLE PART ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WE ARE THE CONVENER OF THAT COALITION THAT AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM UNITED AIRLINES WAS- JUST SPEAKING ABOUT AND WHEN IT COMES TO AVIATION EMISSIONS AND WE'VE ALREADY. MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WERE SO FAR AWAY FROM AIRPLANE ABOUT TO VACATION IN ALL THE AIRPORTS ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN ON THE GROUND TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS SO. CW PATIENT WHO WAS THE ONLY REAL VIABLE OPTION WE HAVE TO DRASTICALLY REDUCE OUR AVIATION EMISSIONS AS WELL AS- INCREASE AIR QUALITY FOR NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND- ALL THEIR FIELD WORKER SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR PARTNERSHIP FOR THE STATE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE. NEXT THANK YOU SENATOR CODEY BOILS IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED BIO WHOSE ALLIANCE. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PERMITS EVERY PANEL AGREED ON IS THE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM A- PETROLEUM BASED THAT TRANSPORTATION- FUEL. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A NINE PRODUCERS- BY- DIESEL AND RENEWABLE DIESEL. AND BY USING EIGHTY TWENTY BLAND WE CAN REDUCE. 71% OF THE GHG EMISSIONS. AS WELL AS 60% OF THE DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. AND THIS IS READY TO GO TODAY SO YOU CAN BY REPLACING THE FUEL YOU OFFER REPLACE- SINGLE ENGINE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT. HI A GOOD AFTERNOON SIR LIKE OWSKI- MY NAME IS RYAN KENNYWOOD CLEAN ENERGY LIKE TO MAKE JUST TWO QUICK POINTS- ONE BASED ON COST EFFECTIVENESS FOR A HEAVY DUTY LOW KNOCKS VEHICLES TRUCKS- THE LA A REPORT. MENTION THAT- HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES INCENTIVES ARE. AMONG THE LEAST COST EFFECTIVE. FOR INCENTIVES BUT IF YOU REMOVE FIVE ELECTRIC VEHICLE TRUCKS AND BUSES AB THAT CATEGORY IN JUST INCLUDE LOW KNOX IS ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND VESTMENTS THE STATE CAN MAKE AS FAR AS- PERTAINS OF- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND KNOCKS. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HIM IMMEDIATE AND IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND- CLIMATE BENEFITS THE KNOX TRUCKS WITH RENEWABLE FUEL WHAT WOULD BE THE DO THAT. I ALSO LIKE TO MENTION TO- REGARDING FUNDING- WE ALL WANT MORE FUNDING IN LOVE TO SIT STILL AND STATE YOUR PURSUE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE. IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING BUT OBVIOUSLY THE LIMITATIONS ARE ARE CLEAR AND IF YOU LOOK AT G. JURA FUNDING ALONE- I THINK THERE'S IT'S NOT JUST COST EFFECTIVENESS WITH AIR BE DECISIONS BUT I THINK THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE. AND THIS YEAR IN- THE CLEAN TRUCK AND BUS PROGRAM HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS BUDGETED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THERE WAS A- AN ATTEMPT LAST YEAR BY AIR BE STAFF TO GRADUATE LOW KNOCKS VEHICLES OUT OF THAT PROGRAM AT AGE FIFTY WHICH IS UNDER CONDUCT. IN TRUCKS AND BUSES AND- MAKE IT MORE OF AN EASY FUNDING SOURCE. FORTUNE THE BOARD I AM IT'S WISDOM DOT DECLINED TO PURSUE THAT BUT THAT IS STILL- HANGING OVER THE FUNDING THAT FUNDING PLAN DISCUSSIONS FOR THIS YEAR. SO WE DO ASK THAT- THE LEGISLATURE- EXERT AT THE ALREADY AND- EXPRESSLY- INCLUDE LOW KNOCKS- TRUCKS. TRUCK FUNDING IN AT THE AGE THAT PROGRAM- FOR THE NEXT FUNDING YEAR BECAUSE IT'S UNCERTAIN IF I AB STAFF WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING THAT TO THEMSELVES SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAX. GOOD AFTERNOON JULIE AROUND OFF ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR A NONPROFIT FOCUSED ON PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. AND IMPROVING AIR QUALITY- WE'VE SEEN THE NEED TO REDUCE OUR TRANSPORTATION. EMISSIONS AND TO GET THEIR CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PROPERLY TRANSITION ENGINES TO ZERO MISSION AND NEAR ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH. REGULATION SUCH AS THE ADVANCE CLEAN TRUCK ROLL AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE STANDARDS AS WELL AS INCENTIVES. WE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY FROM OUR RELIANCE ON PETROLEUM DIESEL AND GASOLINE TO CLEANER ALTERNATIVES THROUGH. REGULATIONS LIKE A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WE NEED TO REFORM OUR LAND USE POLICY. OF OUR LAND USE PLANNING TO CURB LOGISTICS FOR ALL IN THE FREE INDUSTRY TO HELP OUR ESIDENTS REDUCE COMMUTE TIMES. WE NEED TO REDUCE OUR VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BY PROVIDING CLEAN MOBILITY FOR ALL SUCH AS TRANSIT AND BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FINALLY- WE NEED TO SHIFT OUR PARADIGM THAT ARE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES FROM BUILDING CAPACITY WHICH ONLY INDUCES MORE DRIVING TO MULTI MODAL PLANNING THAT REDUCES EMISSIONS ON THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REFLECT THESE PRIORITIES. AND ITS BUDGETING SPEND LESS ON THE ROADS AND MORE UNCLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND CARS PUBLIC TRANSIT AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION THANK YOU. X. I AM A LIPO PARDON ON THE POLICY ADVOCATE CLIMATE PLANET CLIMATE PLAN IS A NETWORK A FIFTY PLUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT LOOK AT THE INTERSECTION OF LAND USE TRANSPORTATION CLIMB IT AND- QUESTION OF THIS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. A AND HOUSING SORRY- AND WE DO THIS BY CONVENING THE GROUPS AND TALKING ABOUT A MULTITUDE OF ISSUES WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY BUT OUR LITTLE DISHEARTENED BY THE LACK OF ADVOCACY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY THAT WERE ON THAT WAS ON THE PANELS. TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS WILL REDUCE NOT JUST THROUGH POLICY BUT THEY HAVE TO INCLUDE COMMUNITIES AND WE HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE MOVES FORWARD THERE GREATER PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING AND KEEP COMMUNITIES HEALTHIER SAFER AND CLEAN- ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE ALSO NOT GOING TO BE THE SAVING GRACE TO REDUCING EMISSIONS. WE HAVE TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES IN A MULTITUDE OF VENUES MANY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE ALREADY LEFT BEHIND BY TRANSPORTATION INNOVATIONS AND AS WE PUSH FOR ELECTRIFICATION WHICH IS GOING TO BE LEAVING THOSE COMMUNITIES BEHIND EVEN MORE. THANK YOU. X. GOOD AFTERNOON BRANDING RCM HAVE A CAL STAR A LOT OF THE COMMENTS MADE ONE ECHO THE ONES MADE BY SECRETARY CAME IN CENTER BELL ABOUT LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES FOR TRANSPORTATION- YOU KNOW WON'T REPEAT THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RUNNING TRANSPORTATION BUT WE THINK THAT W. DOWN IS VERY NECESSARY NOT ONLY JUST TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS REDUCE EMISSIONS BUT YOU KNOW FOR THE SAKE OF IN THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA SENDING MARKETS CANDLES IS CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INVESTORS THOSE MANY FACTORS FEEL LIKE THIS IS A STATE THAT IS COMMITTED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES- COMMENT I'D LIKE TO MAKE REGARDING- THE- AIR BE CLEANED THE BUS PROGRAM- THEIR INCOME IS MADE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S COST EFFECTIVENESS BUT- THE SOURCE. OF A MISSED TRANSPORTATION AND EVERY GIVE STERN NUMBER BEHALF FOR THE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS COME FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THE TOWARD ON BY THE BIG TRUCKS TO BE BUSES GETTING THOSE AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE IS THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS NOT ONLY JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BEFORE AN EQUITY COMPONENT- DO MUCH SAID ON THE FINANCE PART THAT THE CREATURE THE BUS FROM GRAHAM LARGELY OPERATED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS A LOT OF PLACES WHERE WAREHOUSES ARE IT'S A LOT OF PLACES WHERE TRUCKS HAVE TO TRAVEL THROUGH THOSE CORRIDORS SO BEING THAT W. DOWN ON THIS SPECIFIC PROGRAM DOES HELP BOTH HONOR GHG EMISSIONS BUT ALSO HAS A LOT EQUITY COMPONENT. THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE THINK IT'S PART. OF THANKS. THANK YOU. I JOSH A STAR WITH TRANSFORM ORGAN. THAT TO. AND SUSTAINABLE LAND USE ENTRANCE. POLICY IN ADDITION TO ALIGNING MY COMMENTS AT THOSE OF CLIMATE PLANNING COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR LEADERSHIP COUNCIL- I'D LIKE TO FOCUS LITTLE BIT ON THE TRANSIT PORTION- DOCTOR HANDY REMARKS ON THE NEED FOR LAND USE CHANGE. I'D AND NEEDS TO BE NOTED ARE WILDLY POPULAR AND BORN OUT IN HOUSING MARKETS. INVESTMENT SHE MENTIONED ARE OFTEN SO VALUED BY CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY DRIVE HOUSING PRICES FAR ABOVE THE ABILITY FOR. THE HIGHEST PROPENSITY TRANSIT RIDERS SO THIS THIS IDEA THIS. ILLUSION THAT WE'RE JUST THIS WE ARE THIS CAR CENTER CULTURE WHO LOVES A CAR'S LOVES OUR CARS SO MUCH. ISN'T BORNE OUT AS MUCH IN THE MARKETS FOR YOU SEE SUBURBANIZATION OF POVERTY THAT MEANS YOU HAVE FALLING LAND VALUES. BECAUSE THE DEMAND ISN'T THERE WERE AS WERE YOU GET HIGH QUALITY TRANS OR IN DEVELOPMENT THE LAND USES I'M- AT THE PRICES FOR LAND. SKYROCKET AND BECOME ACTUALLY A PROBLEM FOR KIND OF A RIDERSHIP FOR GREATER RIDERSHIP ISSUES SO WITHOUT THINGS LIKE AFFORDABILITY EMBEDDED IN TEO DE. UM SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A YOU KNOW AT. A LESS BAD PROBLEM TO HAVE RIGHT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE CLAMORING TO LIVE WHERE THEY CAN HAVE GOOD ACCESS TO BUSES AND TRAINS- MS BREEN'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEEDS IN WAYS TO IMPROVE TRANSITS COMPETITIVENESS AND PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES THROUGH BUS ONLY LANES AND OTHER WAYS. ARE KNOWN ONLY ENCOURAGING. THEY REPRESENT THE KINDS OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT REQUIRE NO NEW TECHNOLOGIES NOR ANY MAJOR SHIFT IN OUR THINKING. AND THESE GO TO WHAT SENATOR BELL HAD SAID WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT TIMES AND CONGESTION. THE TIMELINESS OF TRANSIT IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER MODES IS A VITAL COMPONENT. AND GOES DIRECTLY TO THE CONGESTION PROBLEM. TOO OFTEN PUBLIC TRANSIT IS STUCK IN THE SAME TRAFFIC. AND IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT THE MORE ROADS WE BUILD THE LONGER WE MAKE CONGESTION FOR ALL USERS. AND THE MORE WE INCENTIVIZE AND ST UNSUSTAINABLE GREEN FIELD DEVELOPMENT. AND WHEN I SAY AND SUSTAINABLE I MEAN IN TERMS OF CLIMATE BUT ALSO AN EXPENSE TO FAMILIES FORCED INTO DRIVING RIDICULOUSLY LONG COMMUTES. PAY FOR PARKING INSURANCE AND EXPENSE TO CITIES FORCED TO USE VALUABLE LANDS FOR PARKING SPACES. INSTEAD OF HOUSING. WHAT WE NEED A SICK. REFER OF CALIFORNIA'S. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WENEED TO ASK HOW TO DRAMATICALLY GROW TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. UNDERSTANDING THAT THE EXPENSE WILL BE LARGE BUT THE RESULT IN TREMENDOUS JOB CREATION BUT WILL RESULT IN TREMENDOUS JOB CREATION. AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY GREATLY VALUED BY CALIFORNIANS. IT'S KNOWN ISSUE ABOUT. HOW TO BEST GROW TRANSIT THROUGH WRITER DEMAND IN TRANSIT SUPPLY IN A NOTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOWING GREAT LEADERSHIP IN ITS SUPPORT FOR A VARIETY OF WAYS TO GROW RIDERSHIP. AND SHOW THE KIND OF DEMAND NEEDED THROUGH TO PUSH TRANSIT IN PARTICULAR CURRENTLY THROUGH BILLS THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR FAIR FREE ACCESS FOR PARTICULAR GROUPS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. HELLO MY NAME IS SHEER LANE I RUN THE ATRIUM WHICH IS A CREATIVE INNOVATION CENTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY- I WANT TO SAY THAT A LOT OF MENTION WAS HERE ON TRANSPORTATION BUT NOT A LOT WAS MENTIONED ON MANUFACTURING AND I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. AS PART OF THESE EQUATIONS TO REDUCE THE GRENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON A LINEAR ECONOMY WHERE EXTRACTING USING DISPOSING WHICH MEANS IS GREENHOUSE GASES OF TRENT CREATING IT GREENHOUSE GASES OF TRANSPORTING IT IN GREENHOUSE GASES OF THROWING IT AWAY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE USE OUR RESOURCES HOW WE CAN TAKE THIS VALUABLE STUFF AND RE USE IT AND KEEP IT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE IN A SMALLER CIRCLE- IF WE CAN START OPENING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY VALUABLE. TO OTHER THINGS APART FROM THE SEXY TALK ABOUT TRANSPORTATION. THANK YOU. Q. ALAS SAYS SPEAKER IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT. YES HI- MY NAME'S DEAL PAGE I'M JUST A LOCAL PERSON INTERESTED IN TRANSIT. AND LISTEN TO A CONVERSATION TODAY I'M WONDERING WHY YOU'RE DANCING AROUND THE ISSUE OF FUNDING. THERE'S A REALLY SIMPLE WAY TO FUND THIS STUFF IS TO PUT A PRICE ON CARBON EMISSIONS. PUT A PRICE ON CARBON EMISSIONS. CREATE A BORDER ADJUSTMENT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPORTING GOODS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. AND THEN REBATE THE REVENUES TO THE POPULATION SODA SWISHES THE IMPACT. I A I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS ALL THIS TALK ABOUT MAKING IT SHINY AND IN DO SEEING PEOPLE TO TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN WE JUST PUT A PRICE ON THE COST. OF THEIR- EMITTING DELETERIOUS GASES INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WITH THAT WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT I'M SURE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WATCHING WE THINK THAT THE LAST SPEAKER WAS THE PLANT BY CENTER Y. CASKEY ON HIS- HIS CONTINUED EFFORT TO RAISE THE PRICE OF CARBON IT'S A SOMEWHAT POETIC THAT WE HEARD FROM TE AIRPORT AND THE- SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION ON REDOUBLING OUR- EMISSION REDUCTION EFFORTS AS WELL AS OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ON THE- CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES IN ACADEMIA AS SPEAKING TO US ON THE CLEANER FLEETS IN THE- RIGHT FOR OUR ORDERS DESIRABILITY OF HAVING FEWER VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AS WE SEGUE FROM THE- CHAIRMAN OF THE POLICY COMMITTEES THROUGH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEES AND WE HAD THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE NEED FOR FUNDING IT WAS I WAS STRUCK BY THE POIGNANCY OF THE OF THE HEARING AND WITH THAT WE ARE TURN.
