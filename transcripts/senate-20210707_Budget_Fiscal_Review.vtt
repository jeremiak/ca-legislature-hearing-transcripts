PRESENTED WITH HERE TODAY ARE.

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:16.002
SOME POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS I

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:18.971
WOULD CONSIDER THEM. IT IS A

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.439
BLESSING TO HAVE A YEAR WHERE

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:21.707
WE'RE NOT FACED WITH SUCH

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.342
ENORMOUS DEFICITS TO CONTEND

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.746
WITH. THERE IS ALSO A YEAR TO

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.215
BE WARY OF THE FUTURE. AS WE

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.217
HAVE THIS LEGISLATURE IN YEARS

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.320
PAST GOTTEN IN TROUBLE BY.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.689
HAVING SURPLUSES OR EXTRA

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:38.524
REVENUE AND THEN SPENDING IT

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.193
AND BASE BUILDING WAYS THAT

APPLY JUST INTO THE FUTURE

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.565
WONDER IF TRYING REVENUES HIT

THE STATE THEN WE WERE IN BIG

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.334

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:51.871
SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE WARY OF

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:55.141
I THINK WE SURELY MUST. AT AND

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:56.943
I THINK THAT THERE'S GOOD CAUSE

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.413
IN BOTH BILLS TO BE SUPPORTIVE.

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.315
BUT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS. IN

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.351
THIS PARTICULAR ONE. THOSE OF

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:07.420
US AND THAT MEANS PROBABLY MOST

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:10.556
OF THE LEGISLATURE. WHO FACE

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:14.627
DANGER OF THE FIRES. I THINK

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.812
DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE FROM

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:57.883
BEAVER- I DID. IT AT THE

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.585
JANUARY BUDGET HEARING ASKED

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:01.286
THE FIRST QUESTION AND IT WAS

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.955
ALL OF THE FIRE MONEY THAT WAS

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:06.024
PROPOSED. WHAT PERCENT WOULD GO

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:08.694
LOCAL AND NOT TO STATE AGENCIES

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.829
AND ONCE WE GOT THE ANSWER BACK

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:16.902
OUT OF. THE HEARING. IT WAS 86%

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:19.338
AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.739
ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT'S IN THIS

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.975
BILL BUT IF IT'S ANYWHERE NEAR

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:26.245
THAT. MY GOAL WAS THAT IT MEETS

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:27.546
EXACTLY THE GOALTHAT WAS

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.648
EXPRESSED BY THE SENATOR FROM

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.483
BEAVER. THAT IT'S NOT JUST

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.985
STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE THE

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:35.654
SKILL AND ON OUR ON THE GROUND

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:38.924
AND THE ABILITY TO DO THIS. AND

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:42.294
WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHICH I AM

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:42.694
TRYING TO ADDRESS

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:45.431
LEGISLATIVELY. WHICH IS THAT

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:47.433
WHILE THE RESOURCES AGENCY IN

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:50.269
THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT SAY

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:51.570
HERE'S OUR FIVE YEAR GOALS. ALL

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:53.539
WE SEE IS WHAT GOES IN THE

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:56.408
BUDGET IN ONE YEAR- A AND WE

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:58.243
DON'T SEE HOW IT ADDS TOGETHER

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.379
WHAT THE GOALS ARE WHAT IT DOES

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:00.913
OVER A FIVE YEAR TEN YEAR

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:04.683
PERIOD. AND SO. I HAVE A BUILD

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.984
OUT OF ASSEMBLY NATURAL

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:07.419
RESOURCES THIS MORNING

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:08.654
EVERYBODY ON THIS FLOOR VOTED

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.622
FOR. THAT BASICALLY SAYS WE'LL

00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:13.091
TAKE THOSE GOALS. WILL PUT THEM

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:15.060
IN THE STATUTE OVER A FIVE YEAR

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:18.030
PERIOD BUT WE WILL ALSO. SET UP

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:19.998
A MECHANISM BY WHICH IN A

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:22.401
TRANSPARENT WAY WE MEASURE.

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.236
WHAT IS DONE AGAINST EACH OF

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:26.104
THOSE THOSE GOALS IF YOU HAVE A

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:29.475
BOWL. OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:30.008
ACRES TO BE TREATED WITH

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:32.344
PRESCRIBED FIRE. IT WILL

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:36.181
ACTUALLY. SAY THIS IS HOW MANY

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:37.516
ACRES WERE DONE IN A YEAR

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:42.821
THEY'LL SET UP. A WORKING GROUP

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.356
THAT WILL LOOK AT THIS AND SAY

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:46.558
WE'RE BETTER FIT TO DO THIS WE

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.627
SHOULD START TO MOVE INTO THIS

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:51.463
DIRECTION. AND SO. THAT MEANS

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.365
THAT THIS BUDGET ITEM IN FRONT

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:55.400
OF US HAS A CONTEXT. IT HAS A

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.469
CONTEXT BECAUSE IT'S PART OF

00:18:57.536 --> 00:19:00.272
THOSE GOALS. IF IT IS TRUE TO

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:01.874
WHAT WAS SAID TO US OUT OF THE

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.175
HEARING IN THE FIRST HEARING A

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:05.711
LOT OF IT GOES LOCAL. AND THEN

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:07.813
IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE WILL BE

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.948
ABLE TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:12.718
ACCURATELY MEASURE SO THAT IF

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:16.488
IT'S NOT GETTING TO CERTAIN-PLACES OR WE HAVE A GOAL OF

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:17.122
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:18.490
SOMEHOW IT GOT TO A HUNDRED AND

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:19.858
EIGHTY THOUSAND. WE HAVE A

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.126
SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:23.629
WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND HOW WE

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:25.864
ADJUST SO I THINK THAT THIS

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:27.533
BUDGET APPROPRIATION IS REALLY

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:30.435
APPROPRIATE. BUT BUT IT IS TRUE

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.572
THAT WE HAVE TO. PARSE IT

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:35.240
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WORK GOES

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.742
HOPE IT MEETS A LOT OF A LOCAL

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.644
NEEDS AND MEASURE IT AGAINST

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.112
THE GOALS SO THAT WE KNOW THAT

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:41.480
OVER TIME WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:43.448
THING. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO-

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:47.319
WITH PLEASURE SUPPORT THIS BUT

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.987
THERE IS A LARGER CONTEXT.

00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:50.689

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:11.877
BEFORE ME- DID A FINE JOB OF

00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:12.744

THIS BILL RELATING TO FIRE

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:20.185
SAFETY AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:21.586
FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO

QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:34.866

TO MOVE THAT MONEY TO PLACES

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:58.663
WHERE WE CAN SPEND. YES I JUST

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.064
LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE OF THE

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:02.066
EARLY ACTION SO I WILL NOTED

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:03.034
EARLIER THE EARLY ACTION DID

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.869
INCLUDE SPECIFIC FUNDING CALL

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:06.671

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:21.286
A SPECIFIC CONSERVANCY-

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:23.087
OCCASION JUST LIKE THERE WAS IN

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.889
IN THE EARLY ACTION I THINK

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.124
THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE THE KIND

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:27.725
OF. THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD GO

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:29.394
TOWARDS A DIFFERENT PROJECTS

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.296
BUT THOSE DETAILS I THINK ON

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:32.697
THE FUNDING IN THIS SPECIFIC

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:34.365
BUDGET- THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:35.433
TODAY THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.504
DISCUSSED- YOU KNOW OVER THE

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:40.071
NEXT COUPLE MONTHS WITH THE

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:41.272
LEGISLATURE. BUT THE BY THIRTY

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:42.373
SIX MILLION THAT WAS IN EARLY

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.042
ACTION. IT ACTUALLY INCLUDES

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:45.009
FUNDING FOR CONSERVANCY

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:46.611
SPECIFICALLY TO GET THOSE

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.713
PROJECTS ON GROUND. RIGHT I

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.982
UNDERSTAND THAT. I UNDERSTAND

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:52.116
IT WE ALLOCATED I SAID ON SEPT

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.952
TWO. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE

00:30:54.018 --> 00:30:55.253
ALLOCATED THE RESOURCES TO

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.455
THOSE CONSERVANCY'S. AND TO MY

00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:58.289
KNOWLEDGE THEY'VE USED THAT

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:00.525
MONEY. WE NEED TO REPLENISH

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:02.560
THAT NOW WITH THIS POT. IS IT

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.495
WORTH IT FOR THE FOR THE FIRST

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:05.096
TIME IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:07.031
I'VE BEEN ELECTED. WE'RE ALWAYS

00:31:07.098 --> 00:31:08.633
USUALLY TRYING TO FIND MONEY.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.968
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:10.535
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:12.470
SPEND IT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:13.871
ME THAT WE CAN'T. FIGURE OUT

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:16.941
THAT. THE CONSERVATIVES KNOW

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.309
HOW TO SPEND IT THE R. C. D.'S

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:20.278
NOT TO SPEND IT BUT CAL FIRE IS

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:20.979
BUSY FIGHTING FIRE RIGHT NOW

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:22.947
THEY DON'T HAVE THE- RESOURCES

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.249
OR THEY DON'T HAVE THE KNOW

00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:25.450
HOW. TO GET THIS MONEY OUT TO

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:27.785
THE GROUND SO MY QUESTION TO

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:30.521
YOU. IS I KNOW WE DIDN'T HEAR

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:32.657
ANY ACTION I SAID ON THE- SUB

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:33.958
TO COMMITTEE WHEN WE ALLOCATED

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.093
THE RESOURCES. I WANT TO KNOW

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:36.561
HOW TO TAKE THESE ADDITIONAL

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:37.128
RESOURCE WE'RE GONNA VOTE ON

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:39.464
TODAY. AND GET THEM TO THE

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.064
PLACES THAT KNOW HOW TO SPEND

00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:43.067
MONEY. THEN PROJECTS ARE

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:46.571
AVAILABLE. IT IT MAYBE I'M

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:48.673
TALKING TO THE WRONG PEOPLE BUT

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.907
I DON'T HAVE AN ACT I DON'T

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.175
HAVE ACCESS TO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:52.277
OFFICE AND ADMINISTRATION TO

00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:53.678
GET IT DONE BUT I WANT TO MAKE

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.013
SURE THAT WE GET THESE PROJECTS

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:57.081
DONE IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT WE

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:58.349
HAVE THIS MONEY AND WE CAN'T

00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:00.318
GET IT TO THE GROUND. SO WHAT'S

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:04.022
THE PROCESS. SO FOR THESE

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.790
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. THERE

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:08.059

00:32:08.126 --> 00:32:08.660
WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER THIS

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:11.296
SUMMER. MEDICALLY ALLOCATE THAT

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:13.865
FUNDING AND SO AS PART OF THOSE

00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:15.533
DISCUSSIONS AND A FUTURE BUDGET

BUILDING HERE THAT WAS AN

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:18.069
APPROPRIATE THOSE DOLLARS

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:19.537
THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD CATEGORIZE

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.072
DOLLARS AND SIX AND THERE'S

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:22.640
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO GET

00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.477
CONSERVANCY'S. AND THAT'S WHERE

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:27.445
THAT FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE.

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:28.913
THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME I MAY

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.915
SUGGEST INTO THIS. BUDGET

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:32.884
COMMITTEE. THAT WE FIGURE OUT

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.619

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.985
IT'S KIND OF AT A HIGH LEVEL

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:08.986
JUST SUFFERED FROM THE CONTEXT

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:11.155
TO. BUT IT'S BASED OFF OF THE

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:12.790
WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:14.992
ACTION PLAN AND ONE OF THE

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:16.827
COMPONENTS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED

00:38:16.894 --> 00:38:19.030
AS PART OF THAT STRATEGY IS

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.531

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.945

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.162
HAVE BEEN PUT ON OUR CHARTER

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:29.366

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:05.536
CONCERN. ABOUT THE. IF YOU WILL.

00:45:05.602 --> 00:45:09.673
LEVELING DOWN. A TEACHER

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:36.533
IT DOES THAT IS A SUFFICIENT

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.971
MEASURE. FOR OUR TEACHERS. I'M

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:42.539
MAKING THIS OBSERVATION

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:47.377

AND WE'RE PUTTING CHILDREN OUT

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.665
INTO THE COMMUNITIES. I'M NOT

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:11.368
EQUIPPED WITH THOSE LIFE SAVING

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:15.472
TOOLS. AND WE DO NOT HAVE FISH

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:18.408
AND FISH ON THAT CAPABILITY TO

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:20.944
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EDUCATION

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:22.346
TO PROVIDE FOR OUR TEACHERS AND

00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:24.848
THEN ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.750
BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:28.619
COMPETENCY THOSE TEACHERS.

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:31.522
WE'RE DOING A DISSERVICE. I PUT

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:34.658
THIS OUT OF A BIT OF A WATCH. A

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:37.461
RED FLAG FOR THE FUTURE. BUT WE

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:38.962
SHOULD ALWAYS TREAT FOR OUR

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:43.500
STUDENTS THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:47.204
NOT LEVEL DOWN. OR PUT A CAP ON

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:51.308
IT BE THERE TO BE. OR SHE GREAT.

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:56.847
LET ME CLOSE WITH A STORY. WHEN

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:59.149
OUR OLDEST SON WAS. GETTING

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:01.418
READY ALL MY OTHER CHILDREN

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:05.889
GOING THROUGH PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:07.858
BUT WHAT I CALL THE SECOND CROP.

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:10.060
WHEN THE OLDEST WITH

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:11.295
APPROACHING THE TIME TO ENROLL

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:15.832
IN SCHOOL. TO DECIDE WHETHER

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:16.767
THEY WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.902
PRIVATE NOTION FIRST TIME WE'D

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:21.838
EVER CONSIDERED PRIVATE. I WENT

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:24.041
TO A PUBLIC MEETING. OR IN THAT

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.442
DISTRICT WAS AN ENTERTAINING

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:27.077
SOMETHING CALLED OUTCOME BASED

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:30.781
EDUCATION. I WAS CONCERNED

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:32.983
ABOUT THAT. ALCON BASED

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:37.588
EDUCATION. WHAT IT WOULD MEAN

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:39.356
THE DIRECT TEACHER CONTACT WITH

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:41.091
OUR STUDENTS. AMONG OTHER

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:44.328
THINGS. BUT THEN ONE OF THE

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:49.433
TEACHERS GOT UP. AND BRAG. THE

00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:50.834
DISTRICT WAS GOING TO ADOPT A

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:52.636
POLICY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:54.705
GRADE LESS THAN THREE. IN THAT

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:56.273
SCHOOL DISTRICT. WITH OUR

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:01.378
CHILDREN. I WAS IRATE AND I

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:03.547
ROSE AND I SHED WE OWE IT TO

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:05.382
OUR CHILDREN. THAT THEY MAY

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:10.420
FAIL. BECAUSE WHAT DO YOU LEARN.

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:12.689
IF EVERYBODY GETS A TROPHY IF

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:16.126
EVERYBODY GETS TO SEE. IS THAT

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:16.560
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:19.896
EXPECTATION. THAT WE HAVE FOR

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:22.933
OUR STUDENTS THE STREET. AND

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.735
WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT BY THAT

00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:28.205
DECISION. I SEE THAT JUST KIND

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:29.539
OF HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND

00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:31.241
HERE WE SHOULD EVER BE WORRIED

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:34.778

PLANNING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:20.263
OF UNIVERSAL T. K. WHICH IS

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.232
CRITICAL BY THE SCIENCE AND

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:24.034
DATE ON THIS POINT OR CLEAR

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.536
EARLY EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:28.338
FOR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES THIS

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.106
IS ANOTHER STRONG INVESTMENT IN

BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF THIS

00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:39.015
INVESTMENT I DO WANT TO RAISE

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.350
THE CONCERNS BROUGHT BY MANY

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.719
ABOUT UNIVERSAL T. K. THAT THIS

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:44.554
MIGHT NOT BE SUSTAINABLE OVER

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:45.789
THE LONG RUN THAT THIS MIGHT

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.190
LEAD TO DIS INVESTMENTS IN K.

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.658
THROUGH TWELVE IN CHILD CARE.

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.327
WHILE THIS BUDGET DOES ADDRESS

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:51.227
THOSE CONCERNS TO A LARGE

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:53.063
DEGREE BY MAKING LARGE

00:53:53.129 --> 00:53:54.731

AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. MY

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:58.868
BELIEF IS THAT IT'S CRITICAL

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:00.403
THAT WE WATCH THIS CLOSELY OVER

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:05.775
TIME- THE CONCERNS RAISED. HERE

00:54:05.842 --> 00:54:06.409
ARE LEGITIMATE AND I THINK THAT

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:07.510
I AM GOING. OVERSIGHT AND

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:09.012
MONITORING ARE GOING TO BE KEY

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:12.082

ENSURE THAT UNIVERSAL T. K.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.051
OPERATES THE WAY THAT IS

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:17.754
INTENDED THAT DOES NOT TAX SOME

00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:18.822
OF THE OTHER PRIORITIES IN

00:54:18.888 --> 00:54:20.357
EDUCATION. I ALSO WANT TO

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:21.758
HIGHLIGHT THE INVESTMENTS IN

I'M I'M- VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT.

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:37.540
AND IT PLAYED A SMALL PART IN

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:40.110
IN CREATING- ETHNIC STUDIES AN

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.611
ANTI BIAS TRAINING RECEIVE

ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:30.627
EDUCATION HAS BEEN

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:32.729
INSTRUMENTAL. IN ADMINISTERING

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:33.763
THE MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.732

SPACE AND SERVE AS A MODEL FOR

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:51.381
THE EMPTY SS. BUT OVERALL I

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:52.582
THINK THIS IS A GREAT BUDGET IT

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:53.950
STRIKES A GREAT BALANCE IN

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.852
BALANCING OUR- SHORT TERM

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:57.220
CORPORATE PRIORITIES AND

THERE'S A LOT OF USE THEY'RE

00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:00.190
VERY DEMANDING. WITH THE NEED

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:01.224
FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENTS WERE

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.026
TAKING THE SURPLUS AND PUTTING

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:04.194
A LOT OF IT INTO LONG TERM

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.262
INVESTMENTS IN OUR FUTURE. AND

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:07.297
I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:08.965
SUSTAIN THESE INVESTMENTS

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:09.599
RESPONSIBILITY SO I JUST WANT

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:10.700

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:13.703

IS AN INCREDIBLE BUDGET AND I'M

00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:20.110
VERY VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT.

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:24.848
SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:30.386
COMMENTS THAT HAVE COMMON AND

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:33.123
THE COMMENTS PARTICULARLY THAT

00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:34.357
FOR GLOBAL THAT WERE JUST MADE

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:37.694
BY. THE SENATOR FROM VERMONT

00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:40.029
BUT FROM WHAT I WANTED TO DO IS

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:41.798
JUST TALK AT A HIGH LEVEL ABOUT

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:44.868
WHAT THIS BILL MEANS AND THIS

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:48.204
IS ON TOP OF WHAT WE ALREADY

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.673
DID AS PART OF THE BUDGET

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.342
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE BUDGET

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:55.612
ARE WE RESTORED THE PROP NINETY

00:56:55.678 --> 00:56:56.646
EIGHT FUNDING LEVELS TO WHERE

00:56:56.713 --> 00:56:58.748
THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:01.184
AND THEN DID A FIVE POINT 7%

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.353
COAL. WE ALSO FOR THE FIRST

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:06.990
TIME IMPLEMENTED THE RAINY DAY

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:10.160
FUND WITH REGARD TO THE PROP

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:10.760
NINETY EIGHT SO THERE'S GOING

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:12.028
TO BE ROUGHLY FOUR BILLION

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:14.130
DOLLARS IN ASSETS AND SO IT'S

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:15.598
VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:18.768
OVERALL- WE CAME BACK AND

00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:20.537
SURPASSED THE LEVELS BEFORE THE

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:21.905
PANDEMIC AND WE HAVE THE FIRST

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:24.107
RESERVE AN EDUCATION IN MODERN

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:26.209
TIMES AND THAT IS THE BACKDROP

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:28.912
FOR THIS TRAILER BILL- BECAUSE

00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:30.780
THIS TRAILER BILL AND SOME OF

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:33.116
THE THINGS THAT- WE'RE JUST

00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.818
MENTIONED I THINK ONE OF THE

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:36.286
IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT- MAY

00:57:36.352 --> 00:57:37.387
REVISE DID NOT HAVE THE

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:38.855
COMPLETE PAY OFF OF THE

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:41.724
DEFERRALS. THIS BILL HAS THE

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:43.092
COMPLETE PAY OFF OF THE

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.561
DEFERRALS AND IT WAS ERY

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:46.863
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.865
PAY OFF DEBT WHEN WE'RE AT THE

00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:51.201
HIGHEST LEVEL OF REVENUE IN ONE

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:52.168
TIME MONEY IN HISTORY WHILE I

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:54.504
WAIT TO HAVE A DOWNTURN AND

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:55.805
HAVE IT COMPETE AGAINST THE

00:57:55.872 --> 00:58:01.678
RAINY DAY FUND. TRAILER BELOW

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:03.379
THIS ALSO ALLOWS THE

00:58:03.446 --> 00:58:05.415
INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR STUDENTS

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:06.816
WHOSE PARENTS OR GUARDIANS

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:09.085
DETERMINED THAT IN PERSON'S

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:10.486
INSTRUCTION WOULD PUT THE

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:13.656
STUDENT AT RISK WE EXPECT

00:58:13.723 --> 00:58:15.792
STUDENTS TO RETURN TO SCHOOL IN

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:18.628
THE FALL THAT IS OUR HOPE THAT

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:19.863
IS THE GUIDANCE FROM THE

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:23.299
LEGISLATURE BUT YES THERE ARE

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:23.900
PEOPLE THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.902
PUBLIC HEALTH THEY SHOULD HAVE

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:27.537
AN ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:29.672
INEVITABLY WE WOULD BE FUNDING.

00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:31.708
ARE DECLINING ENROLLMENT IF WE

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:33.209
PUSH THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.077
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:35.144
TROUBLE MAKING SURE THAT

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:38.214
EVERYBODY COMES BACK IN PERSON

00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:40.016
ARE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.317
AND SO IT GIVES AN ALTERNATIVE

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:43.086
THAT MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:46.756
STUDENTS NEEDS ARE MET- AS WE

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:48.625
MOVE FORWARD THIS IMPLEMENTS

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:50.260
THE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS

00:58:50.326 --> 00:58:52.362
PROGRAM I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:55.031
SIGNIFICANT THAT IS. BECAUSE

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.933
WHAT WE FOUND IN THE PANDEMIC

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.168
AND BEFORE THAT FOOD IN

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:02.805
SECURITY IS A MAJOR PART OF

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.707
ISSUES IN THE SCHOOL BARRIERS

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:07.176
IN SOME CASES TO LEARNING THIS

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:09.279
ADDRESSES THAT AS WAS MENTIONED

00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:10.947
IT EXPANDS THE TRANSITIONAL

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:14.083
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AND IT

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.251
DOES IT IN A WAY. THAT IT

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:16.619
PRESERVES ALTERNATIVES FOR

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:19.389
PARENTS- IN THIS FROM OTHER

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:22.926
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST SO IT MEETS

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:25.561
A GOAL ABOUT. EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:27.297
EDUCATION BUT IN A WAY THAT

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.432
WORKS FROM A MENU FOR THE

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.935
PARENTS. IT ALSO AND AS WAS

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.269
MENTIONED INCREASES THE VALUE

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:35.204
OF THE CONCENTRATION GRANTS IT

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.073
EXPANDS CAREER TECHNICAL

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.076
EDUCATION EXPANDS THE VIDEOS OF

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:40.977
THE EXPANDED LEARNING

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:42.712
OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFTER SCHOOL

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.047
AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT REALLY

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:47.150
FOCUSES ON. ON ALL KIDS THAT

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:49.419
ARE DISADVANTAGED CATEGORIES

00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:51.287
THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:52.355
AND IT INCREASES SPECIAL

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:54.357
EDUCATION FUNDING BY EIGHT

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:55.525
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:57.860
ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY

00:59:57.927 --> 01:00:00.463
EIGHT FUNDING. AND IT IS A TIME

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.865
TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE WHILE THE

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.401
SUN IS SHINING. BECAUSE I CAN'T

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.769
DESCRIBE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:08.171
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A ROUGH

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.872
TIME CHOOSING BETWEEN THE

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.774
COMMITMENT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:14.978
AND THE COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.212
THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME DOES

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.181
THAT SO WITH THE BACKDROP OF

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:19.782
THE INCREASE FUNDING BACKDROP

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.284
OF A CONTINUED PAY DOWN IN

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.486
PERSON STORES. HI THIS IS

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:24.687
PROBABLY THE BEST BUDGET THAT

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.756
WE WILL SEE FOR K. THROUGH

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.324
TWELVE EDUCATION IN MODERN

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:31.594
TIMES AND- WHILE THE QUESTIONS

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:33.363
THAT GET ASKED IN THIS HEARING.

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:35.164
ON SOME OF THE ONE TIME ITEMS

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:36.366
OR TINGS THAT ARE IN THIS

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:38.368
BUDGET ARE TOTALLY APPROPRIATE.

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:39.435
AND TOTALLY DESERVING OF

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:41.371
ATTENTION I DON'T WANT ANYBODY

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:44.273
