00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.878
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED BY THE

FARM BUREAU FOR. FOR THOSE WHO

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:10.816

THIS WOULD. BE ENTITIES WORK

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:15.921

WHAT THIS BILL IS PRIMARILY

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.896
TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A COT

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:27.967
CREATE A PROCESS FOR. THOSE

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.536
LAND MANAGERS THOSE AGGIE-

TO PRACTICE. ONE ENGAGE IN THE

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.076
PRACTICES THAT MOST CONTAIN

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:39.812
CARBON WOULD BE ABLE TO FOLLOW

00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:41.313
PROTOCOL BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.349
HAVE A PROTOCOL DEVELOPED AND

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:45.384
POTENTIALLY THEN HAVE THEIR

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:50.122
ACTIONS. ABLE TO BE UTILIZED

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:55.060
WITHIN THE- NOT NECESSARILY

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:57.062
WITHIN CAP AND TRADE BECAUSE WE

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:59.231
DON'T NOW COUNTED EVEN IN THE

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:02.301
IN OUR- EMISSIONS INVENTORY BUT

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:03.702
RATHER IN PRIVATE SECTOR

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:05.471
PROJECTS NOW THAT ARE TRYING TO

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:08.073
INVEST IN CARBON SYSTEM

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.642
SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS WHICH

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:10.843
RIGHT NOW THEY WOULD NOT

00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:13.045
QUALIFY FOR BECAUSE WE HAVE NO

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.913
PROTOCOL FOR THAT. SO JUST A

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.383
FOLLOW UP TO AS MANY NO I'VE

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:19.652
BEEN ADVOCATING FOR. INFORCE

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:22.421
FIRES TO BE COUNTED IN OUR

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.856
CARBON OUTPUT WHICH WE DON'T

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:25.858
RIGHT NOW RIGHT- AND THEN THE

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:26.892
OTHER I THINK THE OTHER

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:27.760
QUESTION IS THAT IT'S VERY

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:29.695
DIFFICULT TO AS AS SOMEBODY

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.463
WHO'S IN OUR CULTURE. WHO

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.798
THERE'S CERTAIN PRACTICES I

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.834
HAVE TO DO ON MY FARM THAT ARE

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.637
THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION- BY

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:42.308
TILLAGE. THERE'S ALSO ABILITIES

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:46.745
TO USE- TO PUT CARBON INTO THE

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:49.048
GROUND THROUGH BIO CHAR AND ALL

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:51.250
KINDS OF OTHER GREAT RESOURCES

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:52.651
OUT THERE BUT IT'S REALLY

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:54.420
DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:55.721
MAJOR THAT AND TO FIGURE OUT

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.956
WHERE YOU FIT IN THE PROCESS

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:00.626
OF- MAYBE THEY'RE GETTING A

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.095
CREDIT OR OR BEING PENALIZED.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.130
AND SO I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT-

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:06.965
YOU KNOW WE DON'T PUT THE ONUS

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.301
ON. THE PERSONS I KNOW THAT'S

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:10.769
WHY IT'S VERY CRITICAL AND HOW

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.037
HOW WE IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.406
THIS. BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.007
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU GET

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:17.943
TO THE GROUND. AND THAT'S WHY

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:24.683
IT IS NOT MANDATORY RIGHT NOW.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.220
YOU'RE WELCOME. OTHER QUESTIONS

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:31.890
ASSEMBLY CASKEY. MISTER CAN YOU

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:34.059
EXPLAIN ARE CLARIFIED

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:38.130
THUNDERSTORMS HIGHLIGHT D. D.

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:40.065
POTENTIAL OR THE PROTECTION

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:42.034
THAT YOU HAVE FOR OFFSETS THAT

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.069
STATEMENT AND PRIVATE ENTITY OR

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:46.138
PUBLIC ENTITY MAY WANT TO TRY

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:48.674
TO USE THIS REGISTRY AS FAR AS

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:51.243
TO NOT FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.478
A STATUTORY OBLIGATION OR

00:16:52.544 --> 00:16:55.914
WHATEVER TO REDUCE EMISSIONS.

00:16:55.981 --> 00:17:01.587
SO THE- THIS BILL COVERS THESE-

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:03.288
FOR EXAMPLE WETLANDS

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:04.323
SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY AND SUCH

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.426
LIKE THAT AND RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:08.727
EMISSIONS FROM THOSE SECTORS

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:11.263
ARE NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.299
OUR EMISSIONS INVENTORY. THEY

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:17.469
COULD NOT FIVE. THEY WOULD NOT

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.238
BE ABLE TO BE USED FOR AN

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:22.207
OFFSET PURPOSE SO THIS BILL

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:24.042
DOESN'T NECESSARILY ESTABLISH A

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.944
CONTEXT WHERE THEY WOULD WITHIN

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.312
OUR FRAMEWORK USED FOR AN

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:30.215
OFFSET BUT IT WOULD ALLOW THEM

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:32.317
FOR TO PARTICIPATE IN SAY

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:37.990
EXAMPLE PRIVATE SECTOR- HE-

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:40.826
INVESTMENTS FOR. CAPTURING

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.361
CARBON IF THAT PRIVATE SECTOR

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:45.764
CAN FEEL ASSURED THAT THE THAT

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.267
THE PRACTICE THAT WHICHEVER

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:51.670
ENTITIES ENGAGED IN IT ACTUALLY

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.505
CAPTURES ARE CONTAINS CARBON

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.174
PAPER I MEAN I THINK IT YOUR

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.408
BILL GOES DOES MORE THAN THAT

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:58.877
IS SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT ALLOW.

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.579
IT THAT THE CREATION OF A

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:03.248
CREDIT FOR- FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:05.617
THE OF THE MARKET BASS THING

00:18:05.684 --> 00:18:09.822
EXACTLY YES- AND THEN JUST SO.

00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:11.824
MY COLLEAGUE WHO SITS ON SEPT

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.525
TWO OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.127
THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:17.095
DISCUSSION IN BUDGET TALKS WITH

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:19.431
THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:21.633

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.035
MONEY IN FOR WORKING LANDS

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:24.736
WHICH GIVEN THE REGISTRY THAT

MORE. INVESTMENTS IN THE LAST

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:35.180
THREE YEARS WE'VE BEEN CUT.

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:38.851
LATER DOES A- SENATE. IDEAS

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:41.186
HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN TO ZERO SO

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.121
WE THINK THAT THERE MAY BE.

00:18:43.188 --> 00:18:45.657
MORE INTEREST THIS YEAR I WISH

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:46.592
YOU GOOD LUCK HOW MOVE THE

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:50.062
BILL- AT THIS TIME BUT JUST TO

00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:51.964
THE EMAIL THAT THAT THIS IS AN

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.232
ONGOING DISCUSSION WITH THE

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:55.067
ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:56.702
ASSEMBLY THAT THEY THEY REMOVE

00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:58.237
MONEY FROM HERE WHICH SEEMS TO

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:01.173
BE THIS IS A- A COUPLING OF A-

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.477
OF- CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:06.078
IN THE MARKET OF WHAT'S GONNA

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:10.883
GO ON. BY THE WAY SINCE GARY I

00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:12.484
HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE THAT-

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:14.753
KELLY CALLINGIS NOW AVAILABLE

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.455

YOU'RE GETTING YOUR DOING GREAT

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:19.758
BUT EVERYBODY OBVIOUSLY SHE'S

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.760

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.962

YOUS ARE SENATOR SKINNER FOR

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:27.266
UPBRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.167
IT HAS A REAL NOBLE GOAL.

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:31.670
HOWEVER IT DOES SEEM TO BE A

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:34.273
LITTLE UNDEFINED ILL DEFINED.

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:37.976
IN WHEN IT GOES TO- THEY ARE BE

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:40.712
ON YOUR- GOALS ARE SETTING AND-

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:42.080
THERE ARE QUESTIONS RAISED IN

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.416
THE COMEDIAN ELEPHAS PATTERN. I

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:45.918
WONDER IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS ON

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:49.054
PAGE SIX OF EIGHT. IT SPEAKS

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:50.122
ABOUT THE AUTHOR ME WE SHOULD

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:52.157
CONSIDER ALLOWING- PRD DEFINED

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:55.794
PROJECTS. IN THERE'S ONE OTHER

00:19:55.861 --> 00:20:03.535
THAN JUST HARD FOR US. THOSE

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:06.271
PAGE. IT SAYS. SINCE PARAGRAPH

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:07.773
IS THREE TO THE RED TO. FOR

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:09.575
PRIOR. THAT DO YOU TYPE OF WORK

00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:10.609
BUT THE AUTHOR ME WE SHOULD

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.711
COME CLARA THE- YOU NEED TO GET

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:16.248
ALONE ARE ALSO RESULT. AND I'M

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:20.719
SICK HOME PAGE. SIX DEBATERS AT

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:21.887
THE TOP OF THE PAGE. REGARDING

00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:24.122
DEFINING. SO IT I CAN CLOSER

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.157
THE AREAS THAT ARE A LITTLE

00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:27.159
TROUBLE FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:29.861
TODAY I I'D LIKE THE GOAL THAT

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:30.996
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE BETTER

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:35.968
DEFINED CHEN IN A COUPLE AREAS.

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:38.136
IF I MAY ADDRESS THAT MR

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:39.104
DISAGREES. SURE I THINK THIS

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:41.640
IS. A TWO POINT CENTER BATES I

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:43.742
THINK THIS THE FACT THAT IT IS

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:44.843
THE BILL AS WRITTEN IN THE WAY

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.877
THAT IT IS SHOULD GIVE YOU

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:48.480
COMFORT VERSUS CONCERN. BECAUSE

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:50.849
IN I COULD HAVE WRITTEN IT SUCH

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.584
THAT I WAS NOT ONLY CREATING

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:55.754
THE REGISTRY BUT REQUIRING A RB

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.689
TWO COUNTIES EMISSIONS AND THEN

00:20:57.756 --> 00:20:59.291
THUS REQUIRING. A WHOLE

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:01.560
PROTOCOL FOR THAT WOULD BE A

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:03.862
FORCE FOR EXAMPLE AS SENATOR

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.731
DOLLY POINTED OUT. VARIOUS OF

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:07.599
THE HTC'S CONCERNED IN TAPPED

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:09.968
TO PARTICIPATE AND US- THEY

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.236
COULD THEN BE ELIGIBLE

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:14.006
OBVIOUSLY FOR. THE STATE

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:16.174
OFFICIAL OFFSETS BUT THAT IS

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.376
NOT WHAT I'VE DONE IN EFFECT

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.311
YOU CAN VIEW THIS AS KIND OF

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.446
BABY STEPS. WHAT I AM TRYING TO

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:24.116
DO HERE IS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:26.184
THERE IS. PRIVATE SECTOR

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:28.120
INVESTMENT THAT WANTS TO INVEST

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:31.490
IN PROJECTS THAT HELP TO.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.158
SEQUESTER IS THE SCIENTIFIC

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.060
WORD I USE CONTAINMENT TO

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.461
CONTAIN CARBON TO KEEP IT FROM

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:39.197
GOING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AND

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:42.100
WE ARE HALF PUT OUR- WE HAVE

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.735
PUT ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA AT A

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:46.738
DISADVANTAGE BY NOT HAVING THIS

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:47.506
IN A REGISTRY AND NOT HAVING A

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.675
PROTOCOL. SO I'M TRYING TO

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:52.077
CREATE THAT SITUATION WHERE. IF

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.578
THERE IS AN ENTITY WHO IS

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:55.047
INTERESTED IN THIS AND THEY MAY

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:57.749
NEED SOME- FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:59.051
THAT THIS IS A WAY THEY COULD

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:02.220
GET PRIVATE SECTOR CAPITAL. TO

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:03.855
TO ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICES THAT

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:07.192
WE KNOW CONTAIN CARBON. SO

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:08.293
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.661
AND I WOULD THINK THAT THE WAY

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:12.264
IT'S WRITTEN SHOULD GIVE YOU-

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.935
NOT TOO CONCERNED. VERSUS HAD A

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:17.936
WRITTEN IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.371
THANK YOU I THINK TO THEM JUST

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:22.441
TO HOLD OFF AGAIN I'M- A MONTH

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.943
75% SUPPORTIVE. SCROLL AWAY

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.877
DOES IT GOES FORWARD TO SEE

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:28.380
ARE. THE CHANGES THAT MIGHT BE

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:34.686
MADE THANK YOU. OKAY ARE. ZERO

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:37.622
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- FROM THE

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:39.691
COMMITTEE I KNOW THE BILL'S

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:42.194
BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CASKEY

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.296
IT'S A DO PASS- BUT IT IT FIRST

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:46.231
WILL BE REFERRED TO THE

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:47.632
COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND WATER.

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:49.568
SO SO THERE WILL BE A SECOND

00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:51.503
CRACK IT AT THE BILL THERE FOR

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.437

HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION AND I

00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:01.279
THINK- GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:03.115
THE CRISIS IN THE NECESSITY TO

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:05.183
ACT QUICKLY SOME COULD ARGUE

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.452

00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:22.434

QUICKLY. INTO IT. AS A REAL AS

00:23:26.104 --> 00:23:28.306
A REALLY. SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION

EXPEDITED. REVIEW WOULD BE VERY

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:25.389
LOW SO WHAT I UNDERSTAND

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:28.092
PROPONENTS WANT TO BARK ABOUT

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:29.327
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO STREAMLINE

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:30.895

THAT WE COME TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:35:34.832 --> 00:35:36.133
TRANSPORTATION IT WOULD

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.169
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH JUDICIAL

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.438
REVIEW WITH THAT SAID. I WOULD

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.273

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:53.684
CLARIFICATION. ABOUT THAT EXIST

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:54.785
IN THE COURTS WHETHER IT'S A

00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:57.255

HERE'S THE LEGISLATURE JUST A

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.560
PRIMARY THING THAT WE DO IN THE

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:04.195
LEGISLATURE IS WHEN WE HAVE TWO

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:06.264
STREAMS OF COURT DECISIONS. WE

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.199

CAN BE IN OTHERS ARGUMENTS IN

00:36:13.804 --> 00:36:15.473
SUPPORT OF THEM. BUT WHEN THE

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.074

00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:18.743
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IS

00:36:18.809 --> 00:36:20.211
PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS

PICKING AND CHOOSING ON WHAT

00:36:22.113 --> 00:36:24.015
SHOULD BE CALCULATED DEPENDING

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:25.316
ON WHETHER THEY WANT TO DELAY

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:27.351
OR THEY WANT TO SPEED UP. IN

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:28.686
ONE OF THE RULES HERE'S

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:30.588
LEGISLATURE AND I'D I'D MENTION

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:33.090

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.271
SHOULD DO SOMETHING OVERALL

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:40.738
THAT MAKES IT WORK FOR

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:43.140
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU YES SIR I

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:46.977
EIGHT- ONE THING I WILL SAY

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:48.646
CENTER TASK IS RIGHT. AND WE'RE

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:49.747
NOT TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:51.816
CASES IN IN IN THE IN THE- YOU

00:40:51.882 --> 00:40:53.584
KNOW WITH THE WITH THIS BILL-

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:54.652
THE DID THE OTHER THING I

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.387
SUPPOSE THIS IS THAT. YOU KNOW

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:58.389
HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT.

00:40:58.455 --> 00:41:00.724
PUBLIC TRANSIT. PROJECTS THAT

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:01.725
HAVE TO MEET HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:03.194
STANDARDS. IT'S SUCH AN

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.196
UNEQUIVOCAL. ENVIRONMENTAL

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:07.498
BENEFIT. AND DONE SO I THINK

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:09.033
THE IDEA WAS THAT. WITH WITH

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.901
PROJECTS THAT HAVE SUCH A-

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:13.737
FACIALLY- FIVE OF. VISUAL

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.039
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:16.040
ESPECIALLY WITH TH STANDARDS

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.174
THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET THAT

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:18.576
THAT. THAT MERITS THIS THIS

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:22.079
APPROACH ESPECIALLY. GIVEN THE

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:22.613
FACT THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.214
TALKING ABOUT VERY MANY. BUT

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.515
BUT THE BROADER DISCUSSION IS

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:25.749
CERTAINLY GET ONE AND IT'S I

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:26.951
THINK IT'S ONE THAT WE- HAVE

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:28.752
CONTINUED TO HAVE AYE YOU THIS

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:31.488

THEN COMMITTEES IN THE PAST AND-

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.494
RIGHT BUT THEN AGAIN I YOU KNOW

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:39.063
I ALSO THINK THAT WE UNITED

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:41.131

BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A-

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:46.570
THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE TO IT I

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.371
THINK MY GENERAL APPROACH IS

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:48.939
BANNED. IF WE'RE GOING TO OFFER

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:50.074

AND ABSOLUTE MOST OF THE- A

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:51.241
PROPONENTS SAY- THIS BILL

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:52.642
DOESN'T THE ELEPHANT IN THE

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:55.078
ROOM AND THAT IS THERE IS A

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:58.548
PORTION OF. BMT REDUCTION

00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:02.586
STRATEGIES BUT ARB IDENTIFIED

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:06.156
AS HE INITIATED BNP REDUCTION

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:09.726
STRATEGIES BUT BEEN IDENTIFIED

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:10.927
FOR FOUR YEARS. AND THERE HAS

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:14.231
BEEN NOTHING DONE AND IN ORDER

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:16.433
TO ACHIEVE THE REDUCTIONS WE

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.302
NEED IT'S UNFAIR TO SAY THAT B.

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:21.471
M. T. IS RISING BECAUSE SB

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:22.038
THREE SEVENTY FIVE A COMPANY

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:23.840
IMPLEMENTED WHEN THE STATE THAT

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:26.510
HAS DONE NOTHING TO IMPLEMENT

00:52:26.576 --> 00:52:29.479
IT. SHARE OF THE BMT REDUCTION

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:32.482
STRATEGIES- AND THAT'S OUR

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:36.620
QUESTION IS WHY IS SB TWO SIXTY

00:52:36.686 --> 00:52:38.588
ONE JUST FOCUSED ON THE PORTION

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:40.524
OF BEACH REDUCTIONS FOR WHICH

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.759
WE HAVE A PLAN THAT EVERYBODY

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.661
HAS BEEN APPROVED THAT IS

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.263
BACKED BY TRIBAL MODELS HAVE

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.197
GONE THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:48.732
REVIEW AND HAVE BEEN

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:50.567
SCRUTINIZED WHEN THERE'S

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:55.005
ANOTHER SET OF MISSIONS. WHERE

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:57.007
NOTHING IS DONE. IT SEEMS LIKE

00:52:57.073 --> 00:52:59.609
YOU THIS IS THE TIME FOR ACTION.

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:01.211
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:04.781
COOPERATIVELY TO COMBINE AND

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.182
INTERTWINE OUR STRATEGY IS THAT

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:08.184
THE STATE REGIONAL LOCAL LEVEL

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:10.921
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:11.521
AND THAT BRINGS ME THE SECOND

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:14.491
POINT ALL OF OUR OPPOSITION. IS

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:16.693
WE BRADLEY S. B. WANTED TO

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.128
REPORT REALLY CLOSELY AND WE

00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:19.329
DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:21.965
ACHIEVES WHAT THE DIRECTION WAS

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:25.035
ON THE BILL THE REPORT CLEARLY

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:26.736
SAYS. THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.338
STRUCTURAL CHANGE TO THE

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.040

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.541
REGIONAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:33.977

TO THE DAY R. B. MPO APPROVAL

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.348
PROCESS TO ACHIEVE THAT. THERE

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.116
ARE OTHER THINGS THAT ALSO NEED

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:41.084
TO BE DONE LIKE AN

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.118
INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING

BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.183
LOT MORE LESS EXPENSIVE. BUT

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.785
THAT DOESN'T GET CALCULATED

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:39.155
INTO ANY OF THESE. PROGRAMS AND

AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:09.218
PLANNED OR UNINTENTIONAL OR

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:12.488
IRRITATE OR INTENTIONAL- BUT WE

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.456
LESS OF A FOOTPRINT. NO DOUBT

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.926
ABOUT IT. BUT I WILL TELL YOU

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:25.361
THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PEOPLE

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.263
WANT IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM IT'S

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:27.830
ABOUT CHOICE AND IT'S ABOUT

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:29.732
BALANCE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:33.836
BALLOTS. THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:34.337

THE HOUSING MARKET HERE IS

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:44.847
EXPLODING I I'VE BEEN LOOKING

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:45.414
TO TRY TO PURCHASE ONE HERE

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.917
BECAUSE- THE RENT IS ALSO HIGH

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.218
BUT THE HOUSING TIGHTNESS

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:50.453

AND I THINK IT WILL COME UP TO

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.144
THE BUILDING THAT THEY HAVE NO

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:17.013
FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE OR

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:17.747

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AN

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.527

SOCCER AS WELL. I'M ALL I WILL

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:16.272
SAY IS THAT- I HOPE FOLKS

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:18.607
UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS BILL DOES

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.743
NOT IMPOSE THE SAME SORT OF

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.746
PLANNING- YOU KNOW REQUIREMENTS

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:29.885
FROM A CITY ONTO A RURAL. THIS

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:32.088
THE- FRAMEWORK THAT THAT THIS

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.724
FITS INTO. AND THE IDEA IS THAT

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:35.858
THE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE OR

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:36.826
CERTAINLY NOT HELD TO THE SAME

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:40.663
STANDARD AS URBAN AREAS- THE-

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:41.297
AIR B. SETS THE STANDARDS BASED

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.632
BY REGION. AND- IT TAKES INTO

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:45.568
ACCOUNT. URBAN AND RURAL.

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:47.937
DIFFERENCES ARE HAPPY TO LOOK

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:50.106
AT HOW THAT. PLAYS OUT BUT BUT

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.540
I BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.042
LEAVE THIS DISCUSSION I HAVE

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:54.810
WITH THE SENSE THAT WERE

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:56.045
IMPOSING THE SAME VEHICLE MILES

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:58.314
TRAVELED. STANDARDS ON SANTA

01:06:58.381 --> 01:06:59.982
MONICA IS AND BE BERMAN THIS IS

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.050
NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT WHAT'S

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.017
HAPPENING HERE THERE'S AN

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.018
ABSOLUTE RECOGNITION OF THE

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:04.186
FACT THAT. PEOPLE IN RURAL

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:05.721
AREAS BY DEFINITION HAVE TO

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:06.822
DRIVE MORE TO GET TO WHERE

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.057
THEY'RE GOING. THE OTHER THING

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.359
I WILL SAY BY THE WAY IS THAT

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:12.228

THAT- THAT. YOU KNOW THE

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:20.269
STATE'S ON. WHARTON THE THIS

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:21.771
MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:24.974
DELIVERIES. AND ALL THAT AS FAR

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.208
AS I UNDERSTAND IF I'M IF I'M

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:27.543
MISTAKEN IN THAT LET'S GO BACK

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.844
AND TAKE A LOOK AND SEE HOW WE

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:30.613
CAN GET THAT- JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:32.081
THAT THERE'S ACCURACY. BECAUSE

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:34.316
I THINK YOUR POINT WELL TAKEN

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.551
ABOUT ME MAKING SURE THAT. HERE

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:38.320
WE ARE JUST OFFSITE. YOU KNOW

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.055
IF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BEING

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:41.490
OFFSET ON ONE SIDE BUT REPLACED

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.758
BY SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT HAS

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.794
TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.294
THERE ARE OTHER AS WE'RE

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.296
KIDDING OURSELVES SO- SO.

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:48.364
THERE'S A THERE'S A VERY

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.865
DIFFERENT SET OF STANDARDS THAT

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.901
ARE APPLIED TO RURAL URBAN-

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:53.903
REGIONS AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:55.337
SURE THAT WAS CLARIFIED AND-

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:56.439
AND IT WAS. VERY MUCH

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:58.441

TOTALLY AGREE THAT THAT'S THE

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:07.917
WAY IT SHOULD BE. UNFORTUNATELY

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:08.951
WHEN IT'S GIVEN THE A. R. B. IT

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:10.719
BECOMES. YOU KNOW VERY COOKIE

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:12.354
CUTTER AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE

HERE. TO BE PAINFULLY AWARE OF.

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:57.286
IS HOW THE AND THE MARKETING

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.021
CLAIMS THAT OUR ON PRODUCTS ARE

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.789
IS GETTING SO OUT OF WHACK WITH

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.758
THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE SEE.

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:05.861
THE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON THEIR

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:06.428
PRODUCT AND THEY PUT IN THE

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:08.564
RECYCLING BIN. I THINK FULLY

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:09.965
EXPECTING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:12.067
RECYCLED AND OF COURSE AS SO

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:14.069
MANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE NOT.

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:18.474
SO A CURRENT LAW. THIS IS THE

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.008
INTERESTING THINGS MEMBERS

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:21.443
CURRENT LAW. PROHIBITS THE

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:23.545
MANUFACTURE FOR MAKING AN ENTRY

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:24.413

AS- YOU KNOW. RECYCLABLE YOU

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:30.519

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:32.454
OF A PRODUCT IF IT'S NOT

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:34.423
RECYCLABLE IT'S NOT A TRULY

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.725
RECYCLABLE BUT- ARE THE LAW

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.027
DOES NOT COVER THE CHASING

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.662
ARROW SYMBOL SO THAT YOU KNOW

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:40.963
THAT THAT THAT THAT RECYCLING

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.599
SYMBOL THAT WE ALL. KNOW AND

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:44.333
SEE ON OUR ON OUR ON OUR

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:49.605
PRODUCTS. SO NOW ARE. EVERYBODY

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:50.906
THINKS OF THAT SYMBOL MEANS

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.274
THAT IT MEANS IS THIS IS

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.909
RECYCLABLE SO A LOT OF A LOT OF

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.177
COMPANIES WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.512
TO PUT RECYCLABLE ON THEIR ON

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:57.613
THEIR PRODUCTS STILL GO AHEAD

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.647
AND PUT THE RECYCLE RECYCLING

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.149
SYMBOL ON THEIR PRODUCTS. AND

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:00.983
THEN THEY SAY OH WE'RE JUST

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.518
TRYING TO CURSE PEOPLE TO

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.253
RECYCLE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN.

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:06.955
WELL THE TRUTH IS THAT IT'S

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.691
INCREDIBLY DECEPTIVE. AND IT IN

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:09.792
BYTHE WAY THE TRUTH IS THAT

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.827
LESS THAN 15% OF OUR SINGLE USE%

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.429
PLASTICS. ARE CURRENTLY BEING

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:17.099
RECYCLED- AND RECYCLING COSTS

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.234
NOW EXCEED THE SCRAP VALUE OF

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:21.303
THE PLASTIC MATERIAL ITSELF.

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:22.404
CONSUMERS AS I SAY ARE

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:24.106
DUTIFULLY FILLING THEIR BLUE

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.742
BINS. OUT WITH ITEMS THAT THEY

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:28.711
BELIEVE ARE RECYCLING NOW WE

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:29.678
STARTED TO CALL THIS PHENOMENON

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:32.347
WHICH CYCLING BECAUSE- IN

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:34.516
PEOPLE DAVEY WATER PRODUCTS TO

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.918
BE RECYCLED AND THEY THEY DON'T

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:37.453
WANT TO THINK THAT ALL THE

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:38.387
STUFF THAT THEY'RE BUYING IS

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:40.389
GOING TO TREAT TO THE LANDFILL.

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:41.957
NOT ONLY IS SO MUCH TO GOING TO

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.358
LANDFILL BUT ACTUALLY THE

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.527
PROCESS OF WISH CYCLING IS

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:46.895
ACTUALLY CREATING A LOT OF

01:12:46.962 --> 01:12:49.098
CONTAMINATION- IN THE WASTE

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:51.300
STREAM BECAUSE THE MORE STUFF

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:52.568
GOING INTO THE RECYCLING BINS

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.303
THAT ARE NOT TRULY RECYCLABLE.

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:55.771
THE MORE IT HAS TO GET SORTED

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:56.739
OUT THE MORE OF IT ENDS UP

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:59.007
GETTING STUCK INTO BALES OF

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.743
RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. IT'S PART

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:02.277
OF WHY CHINA ACTUALLY PUT THE

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:03.979
KIBOSH ON ALL OUR MATERIALS

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.180
BEING SENT THERE BECAUSE WE

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:07.416
WERE SENDING BALES OF RECYCLED

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:08.250
FOR PURPORTEDLY RECYCLING

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:09.618
MATERIAL RECYCLABLE MATERIAL

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.620
THAT WERE CONTAMINATED BY.

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:13.889
OTHER MATERIALS AND SO THE IDEA

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:15.557
IS THAT IF YOU HAVE OF MATERIAL

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.192
IS NOT ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE THEN

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:17.993
HAS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.828
CONVEYOR BELT AT THE RECYCLING

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.230
FACILITY HAS TO BE CARTED AWAY

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:22.164
TO A LANDFILL THERE'S A WHOLE

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.732
PROCESS IF MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:26.835
NOT BEEN. TO A SORTING FACILITY

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:29.204
RECYCLING FACILITY OR DUMP- I

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:35.077
CAN'T- ENCOURAGE YOU MORE TO GO.

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:35.711
IT'S SUCH A IT'S AN EYE OPENING

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:39.548
EXPERIENCE- SO. IT THE IDEA IS

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:40.749
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.184
ISSUE RESOLVED THAT WE'RE GOING

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.420
TO FINALLY- YOU KNOW. EXTEND

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:48.423
THE- BASICALLY THE ANTI FRAUD

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.392
LANGUAGE THAT THAT EXISTS WITH

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.294

THINGS BUT TO JUST GIVE THEM

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.793
THE POWER IF THEY DON'T MEET TO

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:13.628
SEVENTY SO LET'S JUST TAKE FOR

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:15.897
EXAMPLE. THEY BANNED SOME OF

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:17.298
THESE PRODUCTS THAT AREN'T. I

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:19.734
GUESS. LEGIT I GUESS SOME

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.068
PEOPLE FRAUD IN THE SYSTEM BUT

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:22.436
I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT AND

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:23.738
I'M NOT I'M NOT AWARE THAT

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:25.273
THAT'S WHAT I USED TO MEET WITH

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:27.308
THE WIND BAND THE PRODUCTS-

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.476
THEY WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:30.778
CAN'T CLAIM THAT IT. YOUR ITEMS

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:32.280
RECYCLABLE WHEN IT'S NOT.

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:33.748
RECYCLABLE IN THE END OF THE

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:34.248
DAY WHEN IT'S NOT BEING

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.917
RECYCLED. OKAY SO THAT'S THE-

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:37.051
THAT'S THE KEY WORD YOU JUST

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:38.552
SAID THEY'RE NOT BEING IS IT

01:32:38.619 --> 01:32:39.453
RECYCLABLE OR IS IT NOT

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.422
RECYCLABLE. THIS IS THE TIRES

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:42.490
OR RECYCLE BUT YOU CAN'T GET

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:43.891
RID OF THEM AND NOW SO THIS IS

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:44.892
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:45.826
THE DISCUSSION ABOUT.

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.461
ABSOLUTELY SENATORS. THIS IS

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.330
THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.998
BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN IN IN OUR

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:52.934
SYSTEM. AND THAT IS THAT THERE

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.834
ARE A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:55.703
TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE UNDER

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:57.371
PERFECT CONDITIONS YOU CAN. PUT

01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:59.340
IT IN A LAB ENVIRONMENT BUT A

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:00.441
THOUSAND DEGREES AND THAT

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:02.209
INCREDIBLE EXPENSE. TURN IT

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:03.878
INTO SOMETHING NEW. AND THAT IS

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:05.913
TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE. BUT IN

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:08.082
IN IN THE REAL WORLD IN REAL

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:09.250
DAY LIFE EVERYDAY LIFE THESE

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:10.918
ITEMS ARE GARCIA. THERE'S JUST

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:12.954
SIMPLY NO MARKET THERE WHETHER

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.689
BE WHETHER BE FOR WHAT THE BE

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:15.890
THE SORTING PROCESS OR WITH THE

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:17.625
BE THE MARKET. WHETHER BE THE

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:19.226
AS THE COST OF THAT BUT THE

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:21.062
ENERGY EXPENDITURE ASSOCIATED

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:21.729
WITH WITH TURN THESE THINGS

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:23.364
INTO SOMETHING NEW. FOR

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:24.465
WHATEVER REASON THESE ITEMS

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:27.535
DON'T END UP GETTING RECYCLED

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:28.602
IN THE DAY NOW. THIS IS A WORK

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:29.203
TO GET SOME TRUTH IN

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:30.271
ADVERTISING TO THE GENERAL

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:31.539
PUBLIC WHO DOESN'T REALIZE THAT

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:32.206
THESE TEMS ARE NOT GETTING

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:34.675
RECYCLED. HAS A BETTER SENSE

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:37.011
NOW HERE'S THE THING. IF WE CAN

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:38.079
CREATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:39.246
THESE ITEMS TO BE RECYCLED

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:40.848
THIS. THIS BILL ACTUALLY

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:42.283
PROVIDES A PATH. FOR THOSE

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:43.584
PRODUCTS THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT

01:33:43.651 --> 01:33:45.586
BEING RECYCLED NOW. TO GET. YOU

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:47.121
KNOW TO GET INTO THE RECYCLABLE

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:50.791
CATEGORY- AND THEN I CAN TALK

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:52.593
ABOUT IF YOU LIKE. BUT I

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.328
BELIEVE THE WHAT WE DON'T WANT

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:58.265
PEOPLE TO DO IS TO CONTINUE TO.

01:33:58.332 --> 01:33:59.400
IN A PUT THESE CHASING ARROW

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.602
SYMBOLS ON TO THEIR PRODUCTS

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:04.238
WHEN IN ACTUALITY THESE ITEMS

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:06.440
ARE NOT BEING RECYCLED. SO BUT

01:34:06.507 --> 01:34:07.308
WE BUT IN TERMS OF

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:08.909
INCENTIVIZING I'M I'M I'M HAPPY

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.678
TO YOU KNOW TO CHAT WITH YOU

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.613
ABOUT THIS BUT- YOU KNOW LIKE

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.815
ALL ALL TAKE A- THERE'S AN ON

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:16.050
RAMP THAT WE HAVE IN THE BILL

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.418
THAT WOULD ALLOW MANUFACTURERS

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:18.919
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:19.620
CONSUMERS TO RECYCLE THE

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.055
PRODUCT WHILE THEY MAKE. THE

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:22.223
NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:23.758
COLLECT IN STORE AND THEN WE

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:25.826
PROCESS IT AND THEN THEY CAN IF

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:26.327
THEY'RE ABLE TO CREATE A

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:28.262
MECHANISM WHERE THEIR ITEMS

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:28.763
ACTUALLY STARTING TO GET

01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:29.997
RECYCLED AND THEY CAN. THEN

01:34:30.064 --> 01:34:31.899
THEY CAN PUT THE CHASING

01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:37.204
ARSENAL'S BACK ON. SO THE- I

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:37.671
THINK THEY HAVE THAT

01:34:37.738 --> 01:34:38.739
CLARIFICATION I THINK THAT

01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:40.074
NEEDS TO BE REALLY DELIGHTED

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:41.642
OUT THAT THIS BILL S NOT ABOUT

01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:42.643
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE RECYCLED

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:43.944
THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT'S JUST

01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:44.879
NOT GETTING RECYCLED BECAUSE

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:46.680
THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THAT'S

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:47.448
REALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:48.983
THERE'S NO ARE THERE OR THE

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:51.018
COST IS TOO HIGH SO. WHEN I

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:53.687
WHEN I LOT OF FACTORS YEAH

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:55.823
THERE IS REALLY SO IT'S WHEN

01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:57.458
YOU SAY IT'S CONTAMINATING THE

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:00.094
BAIL. SO THIS I DON'T I DON'T

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:01.695
HAVE A PRODUCT. AND I DID I

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.964
COULD. FEEL MY NEWSPAPER BACK

01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:05.966
LIKE A FILM THAT I THAT'S OF

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:07.234
BROKEN DAMAGED. IT IS

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:09.203
RECYCLABLE TECHNICALLY BUT THE

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.272
WAYS PEOPLE HATE IT BECAUSE IT

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:12.306
BASICALLY JUST MESSES UP THE

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:13.874
BALES IT'S NEVER ALTERNATELY

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:16.243
RECYCLED GETS RIPPED UP. SO

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:18.212
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE.

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:19.513
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RE

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.714
EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON THAT

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.316
PIECE IS THAT THAT SAYING IT'S

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:24.185
JUST DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARD.

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:26.487
OFOR ITS RECYCLE BUT WE JUST

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.022
CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS TOO

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:29.523
COSTLY OR WHATEVER SO YOU'RE

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:30.257
YOU'RE GONNA YOU'RE GONNA

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.059
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS IS.

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:35.262
I'M TRYING TO. I JUST WEST OF

01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:36.063
THE BETTER SOLUTIONS WHAT I'M

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.031
TRYING TO SAY IN THIS YEAH I

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:38.532
KNOW I KNOW THIS IS THIS IS

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:39.967
GOING TO PUT IT OFF ON THE-

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:40.634
IT'S GOING TO PUT IT OFF ON THE

01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:43.504
MANUFACTURE. IS GONNA GET POWER

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.539
MORE POWER TO CAL RECYCLE WHICH-

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:47.141
AT. THAT'S THE LAST THING I

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.676
WANT. I MEAN. THE BETTER

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:50.611
SOLUTION IS SB FIFTY FOUR RIGHT

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:51.812
I MEAN ARE YOU OF THE FACT THAT

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:52.279
WE WOULD HAVE A MORE

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:54.181
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. TO

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:56.083
THIS. WHERE WHERE WHERE THAT WE

01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:57.017
WOULD BASICALLY BE ASKING THE

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:59.487
PRODUCERS IN GENERAL TO START.

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:00.087
MOVING TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:02.823
PACKAGING. RIGHT WE WENT TO I

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:03.624
WAS ON THE COMMITTEE WHAT'S

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:05.192
REAL BILL IDEA TO HOLD BACK A

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:06.427
MONTH HERE AND THERE'S THIS ONE

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:07.795
REACHES ONE DOESN'T IN THE-

01:36:07.862 --> 01:36:10.865
COMING BACK WE'RE COMING BACK

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:15.169
WITH A BILL. PLUS IT DOESN'T

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:17.037
HAPPEN SECOND SYMBOL. THAT

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:18.839
YOU'RE SAYING. SO WHAT I'M SO

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.142
WHAT'S GOING TO. IF YOU TAKE.

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:21.976
JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE WE TAKE

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:23.577
DECEMBER OFF. THE CARRY CYCLE

01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:25.212
TAKES IS OFF OF THESE PRODUCTS

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:27.181
THAT. DON'T MEET SOME CERTAIN

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:28.449
CRITERIA BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:29.984
NOT GETTING RECYCLED. THOSE ARE

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.818
GOING TO GOING TO A LANDFILL

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:32.520
NOW. WHICH IS WHERE THE GOING

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:34.622
OUT ANYWAY BY THE WAY. RIGHT SO

01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:39.293
WE HAVE A. 75% REDUCTION. IS

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.328
CALDERON CARISSA ACKLES GOAL

01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:43.097
475% SO IF THAT GOES UP WHAT

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:44.932
HAPPENS IN. WHATEVER WE CAN'T

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:46.167
MEET THAT BECAUSE WE'RE DUMPING

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:47.234
ALL THESE RECYCLABLES AND YOU

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:50.171
ARE MAKING THE CASE FOR SB

01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:50.671
FIFTY FOUR AND I HOPE TO

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:53.874
CONVINCE YOU TO BE A CO AUTHOR.

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:57.444
WELL IT I FIND IT HARD TO IT'S

01:36:57.511 --> 01:36:58.679
REALLY DIFFICULT TO VOTE FOR

01:36:58.746 --> 01:37:02.183
SOMETHING THAT IS- FOR GIVING

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:03.050
MORE POWER TO THE COUNTY

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:04.718
CYCLING ALSO IT'S CONFUSING

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:06.020
THAT THIS COULD CONFUSE FIVE

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:07.121
AND THESE BRING THESE BRANDS

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:08.255
ARE NATIONAL BRANDS THEY'RE

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:09.990
THEY'RE WHAT ARE OTHER STATES.

01:37:10.057 --> 01:37:11.358
I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:13.561
WAY FURTHER AHEAD IN MANDATING

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:14.662
THAT OTHER STATES ARE THERE

01:37:14.728 --> 01:37:15.863
OTHER STATES THAT ARE DOING THE

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:16.797
SAME THING SO ACTUALLY

01:37:16.864 --> 01:37:18.832
WASHINGTON AND OREGON- ALL

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:19.700
THREE STATES HAVE HAVE

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:21.435
ANNOUNCED SIMILAR LEGISLATION.

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:25.172
SO THE IDEA IS THAT- THAT- THAT

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.740
THAT DID YOU KNOW WHAT BUT

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:27.374
HOPEFULLY HUMAN AND THEN THEY

01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:28.842
LOOK TO HAVE A DECENT CHANCE OF

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:30.511
PASSAGE THAT WILL THIS IS GOING

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:31.912
TO HELP THE PUSH JUST LIKE WITH

01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:33.280
THE NC DOUBLE A MEMBER. MEMBER

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:34.515
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE NC

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:36.016
DOUBLE A SAID THERE'S NO WAY AN

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:37.451
ANTI SKINNER HAD A BILL ON ON

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:38.686
THE ATHLETES RIGHT A

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:40.588
COMPENSATING THEM AND THEY SAID

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:41.188
THAT THE CALIFORNIA CAN'T GO

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:43.157
OUT ON ITS OWN. THIS IS THIS IS

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:44.358
OUTRAGEOUS WE'RE GONNA CUT THE

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:46.126
PAC TEN OUT OF THE NC DOUBLE A

01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:47.328
WELL SHE SAID THIS IS UNFAIR

01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:48.395
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD ON

01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:50.297
THIS ANYWAY AND IN FACT DAN THE

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:51.899
NC DOUBLE A ENDED UP ADOPTING

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:55.569
WITHIN ABOUT A. YEAR THE

01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:56.170
ADOPTED CALIFORNIA STANDARDS.

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:58.672
SO- IT'S TRUE THE COUNTRY. HAS

01:37:58.739 --> 01:38:00.541
NOT. MOVED ENOUGH ON THIS ISSUE

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:01.642
BUT I THINK PEOPLE ALL OVER THE

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:02.977
COUNTRY AND- I WAS ON A

01:38:03.043 --> 01:38:04.378
CONFERENCE CALL OF LEGISLATION

01:38:04.445 --> 01:38:05.212
OF THE COUNTRY THEY KNOW THIS

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:06.647
IS A PROBLEM EVERYWHERE. AND SO

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:08.148
YOU SEE MORE MORE STATES TRY TO

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:09.850
STICK TO STAND I THINK THIS IS

01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:10.384
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US IN

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:12.019
CONJUNCTION WITH. OREGON

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:13.320
WASHINGTON TO JUST RESET THE

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:14.855
CONVERSATION NATIONALLY BECAUSE

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:15.522
WE'RE BASICALLY LYING TO

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:17.024
OURSELVES RIGHT NOW. YOUR I

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:18.726
MEAN I CENTER FRUSTRATION IS A

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:21.161
REAL FRUSTRATION. BUT THE TRUTH

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:21.929
IS THAT THE STUFF NOT BEING

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:23.597
RECYCLED. AND ALL IT'S DOING IS

01:38:23.664 --> 01:38:25.099
COMING UP THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW

01:38:25.165 --> 01:38:27.468
THAT AT THE VERY LEAST UNTIL WE

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:28.035
CREATE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:29.637
APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. ARE

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:30.771
WE WE'RE WE'RE LYING TO

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.239
OURSELVES IF WE IF WE CONTINUE

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:35.342
TO. CLAIM THAT THESE ITEMS ARE

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:36.910
BEING RECYCLED WHEN THEY'RE NOT.

01:38:36.977 --> 01:38:38.646
I'M IT. FIRST OF ALL I'M A LAY

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:40.047
OFF YOUR BILL I WANT I WANT TO

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.515
GET TERE. BECAUSE I GET WHAT

01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:42.750
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I JUST

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:45.619
DON'T KNOW IF THE PATHWAYS AND-

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:46.086
BUT I WANTED TO MAKE A

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:48.155
STATEMENT SO. I WAS AT THE

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:49.657
LOCAL LEVEL WHEN THEY- DID

01:38:49.723 --> 01:38:51.191
FIFTY PERCENT. OUT OF LANDFILLS

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:53.127
WE ACTUALLY HAD LENTILS BEFORE.

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:55.329
THIS IS IN THE NINETIES. WHEN

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:57.865
WE STARTED. IN YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:38:57.931 --> 01:38:59.199
A DON JUAN IS TALK ABOUT TIRES

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:00.367
FOR ME BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.136
FRUSTRATING TO ME AND- SOMEBODY

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:04.071
WHO. OWNS TRUCKS AND USES.

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:06.540
TIRES A LOT OF THEM. I PAY THE

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:09.176
FEE. AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO GET

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.511
IT GO BACK AND TAKE IT BACK TO

01:39:10.577 --> 01:39:12.479
THE- DEALER THAT I BOUGHT TE

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:13.681
TIRE FROM WHEN I GET MY FOUR

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:15.549
BUCKS OR I GET IT WHATEVER. IT

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:19.153
GETS RECYCLED. BUT I ALSO HAVE

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:20.788
A CONCRETE COMPANY IN MY

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:22.323
DISTRICT THAT CAN USE THOSE

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:23.924
TIRES THEY ACTUALLY CAN TURN UP

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.492
TO IT WHATEVER DEGREES I GOTTA

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:27.928
BURN AND MAKE CONCRETE

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.897
SOMETHING WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA.

01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:32.399
SO BUT THAT BUT THEIR BOARD IS

01:39:32.466 --> 01:39:34.835
IN CONFLICT WITH MY- CONCRETE

01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:36.170
SUPPLIER AND PUTTING

THE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS THERE

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:39.640

HERE'S THE THING A SENATOR. ON

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.715
THERE ARE SOME ITEMS THAT ARE

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.050
VERY FOR RECYCLABLE SOME

01:42:03.116 --> 01:42:05.986
PLASTIC ITEMS THE ONES AND THE

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:07.821
TWOS RATES THE P. T. AND THEN

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.122
YOU HAVE THE THREE TWO SEVENS

01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:11.124

THEY'RE NOT RECYCLABLE

01:42:14.394 --> 01:42:16.029
TECHNICALLY THEY ARE BUT BY THE

01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:18.565
SYSTEM IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:20.467
MAKE A PENCIL OUT. THE TRUTH

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:21.835
THE MATTER IS. YOU KNOW WHAT

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:23.270
THE PLASTIC MANUFACTURES THE

01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:24.137
ONE TO HOLD THE CONTROLS HERE

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:26.106
THEY CAN AB CAN DECIDE WHETHER

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:27.140
THEY'RE GOING TO MARKET THAT

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:29.510

THEY GIVE ME PUT IN THE ONE OR

01:42:33.814 --> 01:42:35.282
TWO IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:36.717
RECYCLE THAN THE NUMBER THREE

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:39.052
AND YET RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE NO

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:41.188
SKIN IN THE GAME. THEY TO PUT

01:42:41.255 --> 01:42:42.456

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:45.125
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND AS YOU SAY

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:46.426
IT'S ULTIMATELY TO CONSUMERS

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:47.928
WHO ARE PAYING THE PRICE

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.530
BECAUSE THEY EXISTED ON PUTTING

01:42:49.596 --> 01:42:50.831
OUT THE NON RECYCLABLE STUFF

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:52.032
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY COULD PUT

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:53.467
OUT THE RECYCLABLE STUFF. AND

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:55.269
AS A RESULT OUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:56.336
BREAKING DOWN BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:57.571
SO MUCH OF THE NON RECYCLABLE

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:58.405
STUFF GOING TO THE STREAM AS

01:42:58.472 --> 01:42:59.773
OPPOSED TO THE RECYCLABLE STUFF

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.109
APART- WE WANT TO DO HERE. IS

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:02.676
PUSHED AGAINST THE PUSH THE

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:06.880
PRODUCERS. TOWARD THE MORE

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:08.115
RECYCLABLE STUFF. THAT'S ALL.

01:43:08.181 --> 01:43:10.284
THE GOAL HERE. AND IF WE DO

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:11.218
THAT THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:13.153
THE CONSUMERS ON THE- IN IN A

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:14.354
VERY TANGIBLE WAY. THIS CAN

01:43:14.421 --> 01:43:15.289
HELP THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORK

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:16.323
BETTER. IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:18.158
MUCH LESS LIKELY. THAT DID YOU

01:43:18.225 --> 01:43:20.360
KNOW THE HOLLER CAN CONTINUE TO

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:21.862
ASK FOR RATE INCREASES IN THE

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.163
COUNTIES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:23.830
TO PASS THESE RATE INCREASES ON

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:25.799
PEOPLE. TO BASICALLY BANDAID

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:28.135
OVER THIS BROKEN SYSTEM THAT IS

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:30.971
CURRENTLY. YOU THE CONSUMERS

01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:31.939
ARE PAYING THE COST FOR

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.106
DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE BY THE

01:43:33.173 --> 01:43:34.408
PRODUCERS ULTIMATELY SO WE NEED

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:35.842
TO START HOLDING THOSE

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:37.811
PRODUCERS ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:40.047
PROTECTIVE AND PUSH THEM IN IN

01:43:40.113 --> 01:43:41.548
A MORE IN A IN A IN A MORE

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:43.216
COHERENT SUSTAINABLE DIRECTION

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:44.518
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL HERE

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:45.485
AT WITH THIS BILL IT'S A GOAL

01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:46.853
WITH FIFTY FOUR IT'S ALSO A

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:47.888
GOAL OF LEARNING IT'S ALWAYS A

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:49.456
BILLS DOING DRESSING YOU SHOULD

01:43:49.523 --> 01:43:50.424
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:51.191
THE BASIC SO YOU CAN'T TAKE

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:54.661
CREDIT FOR DIVERSION WHEN

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:55.228
YOU'RE SENDING STUFF OUT OF

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:56.029
STATE AND IT'S GETTING BURNED.

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:58.198
THE IT'S ALL ABOUT. CREATING

01:43:58.265 --> 01:44:00.133
MORE ACCOUNTABILITY MORE TRUTH.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.868

HAPPENING. BECAUSE RIGHTNOW

THEY JUST THINK THEY THROW

01:44:07.975 --> 01:44:08.642
THEIR STUFF IN A BLUE BIN AND

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:10.711
EVERYTHING GOES OFTEN. IS TAKEN

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:12.045
CARE OF AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT.

01:44:12.112 --> 01:44:13.013
AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE PAYING

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.549
THE PRICE NOW BECAUSE OF THE

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:16.583
INCREASING DYSFUNCTION OF OUR

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:19.720

THAT WE DO DO IT ANY BETTER BUT

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:03.263
THE COST. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:03.997
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE KEEP

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:06.199

CALIFORNIA CAN HAVE ANY PEOPLE

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:02.556

01:46:02.622 --> 01:46:04.758
BUNCH OF PEOPLE. AND WE'RE NOT

GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:06.693
LOWER AND WE TALK ABOUT.

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.862
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:10.897
THIS THIS ALL IMPACTS OF THE-

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:13.967
SINGLE MOM WHO'S GOING TO THE

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:14.801
STORE AND TRYING TO BUY.

01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:16.269
DISINFECTANT WIPES RIGHT NOW TO

KEEP THEIR FAMILY SAFE. ALL SAY

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.842
IS THAT THERE ARE SOME BILLS WE

01:46:21.908 --> 01:46:23.577
PASS HERE THAT THEY DO RAISE

01:46:23.643 --> 01:46:24.845
COSTS ON PEOPLE THIS ULTIMATELY

01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:26.646
IS ABOUT TRYING TO LOWER COSTS

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:27.647
AND PEOPLE RIGHTS ALTERNATELY

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:29.483
ABOUT RECOGNIZING THE COST

01:46:29.549 --> 01:46:31.351
DRIVERS THAT ARE DRIVING OUR

01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:32.085
OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:34.588
DOWN. AND TRYING TO COME UP

01:46:34.654 --> 01:46:36.389
WITH SOME SOME SOLUTIONS THAT

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:37.357
WILL MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:39.726
COHERENT AND ULTIMATELY LESS

01:46:39.793 --> 01:46:44.164
EXPENSIVE FOR REGULAR FOLKS.

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:46.733
ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I JUST.

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.168
VENTURA COUNTY DID YOU HAVE

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:51.938
SOMETHING NO NO AFTER THAT. I

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:53.707
THINK I THINK THEY COVERED ALL

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.342
EXCEPT I DO ARE JUST THAT IT

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:56.877
OPPOSE SCRIPTED FIGHT NIGHT

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:58.378
LIVE OF ALL ABOUT THE CONSUMER

01:46:58.445 --> 01:46:59.813
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.414
CONSUMERS LOOK AT THE PACKAGE

01:47:01.481 --> 01:47:03.250
AND LOOK FOR THE FINE RIGHT NOW

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:04.551
THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN

01:47:04.618 --> 01:47:06.286
RECYCLE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FULL

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:07.821
STANDARDIZED EDUCATION SENSE

01:47:07.888 --> 01:47:09.890
WHAT WAS THAT. AB EIGHTY NINE

01:47:09.956 --> 01:47:11.057
OR SB EIGHTY NINE MANY MANY

01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:13.627
YEARS AGO SO CONSUMER EDUCATION

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:15.428
IS PROBABLY FUNDAMENTAL BEFORE

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:17.097
ANY OF THESE WORKING YOU DON'T

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:18.498
HAVE A COMPONENT IN HERE FOR

01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:20.167
THAT I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU

01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:21.968
ADVERTISE IN THE LA TIMES MAYES

01:47:22.035 --> 01:47:23.637
THE MAJOR NEWSPAPERS FOR ABOUT

01:47:23.703 --> 01:47:25.705
A MONTH FULL PAGE THIS IS NO

01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:27.407
LONGER RECYCLABLE THEY FINALLY

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:29.042
GET IT BUT THEY DON'T NOW.

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:31.011
BECAUSE I NEVER LOOK I'M STILL

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:33.180
OPERATING ON WHAT MIGHT LOCAL

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:34.714
WE NOW HAVE THE I. ORGANIC

01:47:34.781 --> 01:47:36.283
WASTES LITTLE LITTLE BANDS IT

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:38.084
WAS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND

01:47:38.151 --> 01:47:39.386
INITIALLY WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:41.087
BECAUSE THE EDUCATION ARM WAS A

01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:43.723
LITTLE LACKING SO I THINK OUR

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:45.325
OUR WAY FATHERS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:47:45.392 --> 01:47:46.893
VERY INVOLVED IN GREAT PARTNERS

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.862
UP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WANT

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:51.298
TO DO IT RIGHT IN THE WATER YOU

01:47:51.364 --> 01:47:53.133
KNOW OFF CONSUMERS YOU KNOW

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.101
NEIGHBORHOOD FOLKS WITH A BLUE

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:56.703
AND BLACK AND GREEN DOWN TO DO

01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:58.305
IT RIGHT BUT THAT'S QUITE

01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:00.173
LACKING HIS SOUL LOOKING FOR A

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.408
SIGN THAT'S GOT THAT LITTLE

01:48:01.474 --> 01:48:02.676
THING ON IT I DON'T THINK

01:48:02.742 --> 01:48:04.744
PEOPLE DO THAT EVEN IF IT'S- AN

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:06.413
ON AND CATCHING THE PEOPLE WHO

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:08.415
WILL NOT A DAY. THIS NEW LAW IS

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:10.417
GOING TO BE A HUGE ENFORCEMENT

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:13.520
MORE EMPLOYEES MARKOFF SO I

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:15.322
JUST THINK TAKING A LOOK AT AN

01:48:15.388 --> 01:48:17.757
EDUCATION COMPONENT TO ALL THIS

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:19.559
IS REALLY VERY VERY IMPORTANT.

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:20.760
BUT WITHOUT I'M JUST GOING TO

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:22.195
LAUGH BECAUSE I DO AGREE DOWN I

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:24.497
THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO GET

01:48:24.564 --> 01:48:27.667
THERE ABSOLUTELY BACK. ON THIS

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:29.803
IS A STEP IN A KIND OF THE

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:31.605
RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IT LACKS

01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:33.073
WITHIN PEOPLE KNOW YOU JUST

01:48:33.139 --> 01:48:34.841
LEADING INDUSTRY NO AND THAT'S

01:48:34.908 --> 01:48:35.876
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME AND

01:48:35.942 --> 01:48:37.844
PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND A

01:48:37.911 --> 01:48:39.479
LITTLE BETTER OF WHAT'S

01:48:39.546 --> 01:48:40.247
HAPPENING AND I'VE LEARNED JUST

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:42.349
BEING HERE. OF IN FIVE STARTED

01:48:42.415 --> 01:48:44.885
CHANGING MY AT HOME MYSELF

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:46.553
TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.021
I'M THROWING IN YOU KNOW THE

01:48:48.088 --> 01:48:54.928
GREEN BAN IN THE BLUE. BAND

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:55.762
FELT I'M JUST. DECEMBER

01:48:55.829 --> 01:48:58.899
POSTSCRIPT BET. WITH THE FOR MY

THIS IS SO TO MEET HIM YOU KNOW.

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:05.105
ONE COULD ARGUE THAT FIFTY IS

02:03:07.546 --> 02:03:09.381
BEING SENT OUT TO THE PUBLIC

02:03:09.448 --> 02:03:10.216
AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF

02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:13.052
THESE- OF CONTINUING PROBLEMS

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:15.154
WERE THE STATE HAS TO BE TOWED

02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:16.555
WE'VE DONE THE BEST WE CAN AND

02:03:16.622 --> 02:03:18.958
THIS IS THE- CONSEQUENCE WOULD

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:21.060
TELL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU

02:03:21.127 --> 02:03:24.497
THIRTY DOLLARS. THE AIM IS TO

02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:26.599
RENT TOTALLY GET PROBLEM

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:29.735
UNDERSTAND IT. M. TOO FAMILIAR

02:03:29.802 --> 02:03:31.604
WITH ACTUALLY COUPLE QUESTIONS

02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:35.307
THOUGH SO. WHO'S GONNA PAY SO

02:03:35.374 --> 02:03:39.044
WE DID. THE STATE PASSED SB

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:41.680
EIGHTY EIGHT THEN WE SAW. THE

02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:43.415
THOSE TWO BOYS A PORTER BILL

02:03:43.482 --> 02:03:44.850
PORTER VILLE IN THE IN THE

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:47.019
VALLEY THERE'S A HUGE

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:47.620
DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES WHERE

02:03:47.686 --> 02:03:51.023
WE HAD- SYSTEMS FAILING IN.

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:53.626
CONTAMINATED WATER AND NO

02:03:53.692 --> 02:03:55.895
FUNDING NO A WEEK NUMBER ONE

02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:57.062
YOU HAVE PROP TO EIGHTEEN THAT

02:03:57.129 --> 02:03:59.298
DOESN'T DOESN'T THEY DON'T PASS

02:03:59.365 --> 02:04:01.300
FEES ON THEMSELVES TYPICALLY-

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:03.235
SO THAT'S A BARRIER YUP LASKO

02:04:03.302 --> 02:04:05.070
CONCERNS ABOUT FORCING THEM

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:07.406
INTO CONSOLIDATION. AND SO WHAT

02:04:07.473 --> 02:04:09.942
WE SAW WAS WE DID THE MONNING

02:04:10.009 --> 02:04:13.012
BILL. THE WAS IT LAST YEAR AND

02:04:13.078 --> 02:04:14.914
I KNOW THAT TO CENTER BY CAL

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:16.448
SKI LOVED THAT BILL BECAUSE IT

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:18.184
TOOK GREENHOUSE GAS MONIES IN

02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:22.988
FIXED A WATER PROBLEM. SO MY

02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:26.892
QUESTION IS A- IT IS HOW HOW I

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:28.661
MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXES

02:04:28.727 --> 02:04:32.031
OF THIS ISSUE. AND WHAT WHAT

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:33.098
WHAT'S A MECHANISM TO ACTUALLY

02:04:33.165 --> 02:04:34.266
WHEN YOU FOR SOMEBODY TO DO

02:04:34.333 --> 02:04:35.801
SOMETHING YOU'RE EXPECTING THAT

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:38.137
TO GET DONE AND CONSOLIDATE BUT

02:04:38.204 --> 02:04:39.071
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:42.408
MAYBE ONE SYSTEM THAT IS. CAN

02:04:42.474 --> 02:04:43.909
IN CAN I READ I READ THROUGH

02:04:43.976 --> 02:04:47.680
THE ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT-

02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:48.747
YOU KNOW YOU BASICALLY ARE NOT

02:04:48.814 --> 02:04:49.815
ASKING THEM TO PUT UP ANY MORE

02:04:49.882 --> 02:04:51.050
MONEY YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:52.918
MERGE WITHOUT PUTTING MONEY UP

02:04:52.985 --> 02:04:54.286
BUT THERE'S A- HUGE DISCONNECT

02:04:54.353 --> 02:04:55.454
THERE BECAUSE- SOME OF THE

02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:58.824
SYSTEMS. NEED SUCH A LOT OF-

02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:00.826
FINANCES INVESTED IN THEM AND

02:05:00.893 --> 02:05:01.560
THEN YOU PUT A BURDEN ON A

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:03.529
SYSTEM THAT IS IN IT SO YOU'RE

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:05.598
TAXING SOMEBODY WHO IS. NOT

02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:07.466
GETTING THE BENEFIT FROM THE

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:08.934
WHICH THEN BECOMES A LOT OF

02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:11.203
QUESTIONS SO I JUST WANTED IT

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:12.371
WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE ON. HOW

02:05:12.438 --> 02:05:13.572
THIS WOULD ACTUALLY PLAY OUT

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:16.508
AND B. B. BURKE. AT THANK YOU

02:05:16.575 --> 02:05:18.744
SENATOR DOLLY AND I THINK- THIS

02:05:18.811 --> 02:05:20.279
IS THESE ARE THE FEW STEPS THAT

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:21.413
NEED TO BE DONE BEFORE

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:22.948
CONSOLIDATION AND AS MENTIONED

02:05:23.015 --> 02:05:24.149
BY SENATOR MAKOWSKI THERE'S A

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:26.051
VOLUNTARY. CALLED CONSOLIDATION

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:28.020
THAT COULD BE AN OPTION.

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:29.588
PARTIAL MERGERS IT'S NOT A FULL

02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:30.823
MERGER YOU KNOW. THERE'S

02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:32.191
DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT COULD BE

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:33.792
DONE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:35.494
THESE FOLKS ARE NOT RECEIVING.

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:37.830
AS YOU MENTIONED. CLEAN WATER

02:05:37.897 --> 02:05:38.898
FOR THE AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:39.331
PAYING AN ESPECIALLY

02:05:39.398 --> 02:05:41.467
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- THAT

02:05:41.533 --> 02:05:42.735
AREN'T GETTING THAT I MEAN TO

02:05:42.801 --> 02:05:44.270
BE ABLE TO. PRINT POTENTIALLY

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:46.071
MERGE WITHOUT THE STATE OR EVEN

02:05:46.138 --> 02:05:46.705
JUST GETTING A LETTER FROM THE

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:49.208
STATE OR- YOU KNOW BY SAYING

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:50.142
THIS IS A SUGGESTION FOR YOU TO

02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:52.478
CONSOLIDATE- AND YOUR WITHIN

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:53.946
THREE MILES OF. A GOAL GOOD

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:56.348
PERFORMING- THAT COMPANY I

02:05:56.415 --> 02:05:58.751
THINK WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:05:58.817 --> 02:05:59.952
FOR AGAIN THE BETTERMENT OF

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:01.854
THE- OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT

02:06:01.921 --> 02:06:04.990
WE ALL SIR- AND WE DON'T. ALSO

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:06.725
WANT TO TAP INTO THE SB TWO

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:07.326
HUNDRED DOLLARS IF YOU DON'T

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:09.929
NEED TO. IT AND THAT'S A

02:06:09.995 --> 02:06:10.829
HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:11.797
MILLION DOLLARS I THINK PER

02:06:11.864 --> 02:06:13.532
YEAR. SO I'M YOU KNOW IF WE

02:06:13.599 --> 02:06:14.366
DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT WE

02:06:14.433 --> 02:06:15.567
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT

02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:17.369
WE- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO JUST

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:18.404
PROVIDE THESE PREVENTION

02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:20.372
MECHANISMS IS HARM PREVENTION

02:06:20.439 --> 02:06:22.308
MECHANISMS TO BE ABLE TO. ALLOW

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:24.043
FOLKS TO AGAIN. COME UP WITH

02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:26.645
THEIR OWN PLAN- BEFORE WE GET

02:06:26.712 --> 02:06:28.314
INVOLVED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE

02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:29.448
STATE WATER BOARD IS ALSO

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:31.216
FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT ARE

02:06:31.283 --> 02:06:32.651
ALREADY FAILING. AND SO THEY'RE

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:36.555
NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW I

02:06:36.622 --> 02:06:37.156
MEAN THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:37.723
ON OUR RADAR BUT- ONE OTHER

02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:39.091
THING THAT WE CAN DO TO JUST AT

02:06:39.158 --> 02:06:40.225
LEAST PUT ON OUR RADAR AND-

02:06:40.292 --> 02:06:42.027
HOPEFULLY. GET THOSE FOLKS TO

02:06:42.094 --> 02:06:44.630
DO IT ON ON THEIR OWN. WELL WE

02:06:44.697 --> 02:06:46.665
HAVE IT UNDER SB EIGHTY EIGHT

02:06:46.732 --> 02:06:48.334
WE HAVEN'T BEEN. SUCCESSFUL IN

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:49.468
GETTING THEM TO DO IT ON THEIR

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:52.137
OWN AND BECAUSE IT BOILS DOWN

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:52.738
TO THOSE THREE THINGS I TALKED

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:55.140
ABOUT WHICH IS. UP TO EIGHTEEN

02:06:55.207 --> 02:06:56.909
LASKO AND THEN FINANCING AND

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:58.777
THOSE ARE THE TO THE- TRUST ME

02:06:58.844 --> 02:06:59.611
THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE HAPPY TO

02:06:59.678 --> 02:07:00.980
DO IT BUT THEY CAN'T. THEY

02:07:01.046 --> 02:07:03.816
CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT. N. A. IT

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:05.484
WE CAN WE CAN PASS A MANDATE ON

02:07:05.551 --> 02:07:07.186
TO THEM BUT A MANDATE IS SIMPLY

02:07:07.252 --> 02:07:08.153
SOMETHING THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:09.388
DO THIS AND THEN THERE'S NO.

02:07:09.455 --> 02:07:10.923
THERE'S NO VEHICLE. FOR THEM TO

02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:12.691
BE ABLE TO RAISE THE RATE. TO

02:07:12.758 --> 02:07:14.460
BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL.

02:07:14.526 --> 02:07:16.028
YEAH IT'S JUST A CONSIDERATION

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:17.196
IT'S NOT A MANDATE AND WHAT I

02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:18.230
WOULD SAY IS RIGHT NOW I MEAN

02:07:18.297 --> 02:07:19.665
WE NEED THE DATA AT LEAST TO BE

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:21.266
ABLE TO SEE. WHERE THESE AT

02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:23.335
RISK FAILING SYSTEMS ARE. BUT I

02:07:23.402 --> 02:07:24.737
WILL TELL YOU I MEAN IT I MEAN

02:07:24.803 --> 02:07:25.704
THEY'RE ON THE CUSP OF FEELING

02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:27.139
BECAUSE THEY HAVE VARIOUS

02:07:27.206 --> 02:07:29.108
INDICATORS. WHICH ARE BEING

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:29.742
ASSESSED RIGHT NOW BY THE WATER

02:07:29.808 --> 02:07:31.443
BOARD. AS YOU KNOW POOR

02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:32.745
GOVERNANCE LACK OF FINANCIAL

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:34.179
RESERVES FAILURE TO MAINTAIN

02:07:34.246 --> 02:07:36.281
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE.

02:07:36.348 --> 02:07:36.915
PRESENCE OF PRIMARY AND

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:38.484
SECONDARY CONTAMINANTS I MEAN

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:40.252

THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THOSE

02:29:33.564 --> 02:29:35.266

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:56.887
PEOPLE. MOVING TO DIFFERENT

02:29:56.954 --> 02:29:58.622

02:30:02.226 --> 02:30:03.260

RESPONSIBILITIES BUT THIS IS IN

02:30:15.406 --> 02:30:17.208
THE BOTTLE. SECOND QUESTION

02:30:17.274 --> 02:30:18.275
WOULD BE HOW DOES THE

02:30:18.342 --> 02:30:19.710

RESEARCH DATA OR THEIR MONEY

02:30:29.587 --> 02:30:31.021
BACK AND WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT

02:30:31.088 --> 02:30:32.923
LOOK LIKE WE'RE HAVING

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:34.892
DIFFICULTIES AS IT IS. HAVING

02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:36.894
PLACES TO TAKE KERR SAID SO

02:30:36.961 --> 02:30:38.796

02:30:43.033 --> 02:30:43.567
TWENTY FOUR SO THERE'S A

02:30:43.634 --> 02:30:45.269
COUPLE. COUPLE OF SECTIONS THAT

02:30:45.336 --> 02:30:47.605
GO ON IS SAID HE SAID ASSUMING

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:49.306

SUBCOMMITTEE WHO'S IN CHARGE OF

02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:57.181
RECYCLING IS GOING TO HAVE TO

02:30:57.248 --> 02:30:59.316
PUT SOME MONEY OUT FOR THESE

02:30:59.383 --> 02:31:03.587
HAULERS AND FOR THE- THIRD. I

02:31:03.654 --> 02:31:05.189
RECYCLER SAID WE'VE HAD SOME IN.

02:31:05.256 --> 02:31:06.424
WILL REMAIN BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:07.525
THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURES

02:31:07.591 --> 02:31:09.059
IMPLODING WHAT'S GOING TO

02:31:09.126 --> 02:31:11.095
HAPPEN IS THAT THERE'S PROBABLY

02:31:11.162 --> 02:31:12.296
WILL BE SOMEBODY'S REVERSE

02:31:12.363 --> 02:31:13.697
VENDING MACHINES WHICH WILL GO

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:15.566
OUT FOR EARLY ADOPTERS THAT.

02:31:15.633 --> 02:31:16.901
DID I WOULD IMAGINE GROCERY

STORES AND OTHER AREAS. FOR THE

02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:22.373
RURAL CALIFORNIA I THINK WHICH

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:22.940

SOMEBODY'S- THE DEPOSIT SITES

02:31:27.411 --> 02:31:29.780
THIS COULD BE A DROP OF. AT A

02:31:29.847 --> 02:31:31.682
DROP FORTUNE THAT. I'M SURE

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:34.185
WILL. BECOME FULL FLEDGED IN

02:31:34.251 --> 02:31:36.387
JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BUT

02:31:36.454 --> 02:31:37.822
IN THE INTERIM. I THINK THAT

02:31:37.888 --> 02:31:39.423
THERE'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW

02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:42.126

MATERIALS NOW SO THAT THEY CAN

02:31:47.531 --> 02:31:48.866
STAY THEY CAN STAY IN BUSINESS

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:51.302
AND THEN AGAIN I. I'M NOT

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:51.902
MAKING THE DECISIONS HERE IS

02:31:51.969 --> 02:31:53.170
GOING TO BE THE- THE

02:31:53.237 --> 02:31:54.472
COOPERATIVE THAT'S PUT

02:31:54.538 --> 02:31:57.308
TOGETHER- FOR WHO WHO THEY'RE

02:31:57.374 --> 02:31:58.108

AS MANY PLAYERS. AVAILABLE THAT

02:32:00.010 --> 02:32:03.547
THE BETTER PART OF THE-

02:32:03.614 --> 02:32:04.081
ECOSYSTEM THAT WE KNOW IS

02:32:04.148 --> 02:32:06.150
RECYCLING. IN MY LAST QUESTION

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:07.551
WOULD BE WHY VOTE TO MORE

02:32:07.618 --> 02:32:09.153

FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. WHICH

02:32:18.429 --> 02:32:20.397
IS 50% BY TWENTY THIRTY HOW

02:32:20.464 --> 02:32:22.500
DOES THIS BILL INTERACT WOULD

02:32:22.566 --> 02:32:24.535
INTERACT WITH THOSE PENALTIES.

02:32:24.602 --> 02:32:26.203
THAT WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE

SEVEN NINE THREE. WELL THIS

02:32:30.341 --> 02:32:31.375
WILL HOPEFULLY WILL HELP TO

CECE'S IN VERY SMALL AMOUNTS IT

02:40:14.271 --> 02:40:15.739
USED TO BE THAT WE WERE TALKING

02:40:15.806 --> 02:40:17.140
ABOUT MEASURING CHEMICALS IN

02:40:17.207 --> 02:40:19.209
PARTS PER MILLION THAN PARTS

02:40:19.276 --> 02:40:21.778
PER BILLION AND NOW WE CAN TO

STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA FOR

ALMOST TWENTY YEARS. AND BASED

02:53:08.344 --> 02:53:10.446
ON THAT LONG EXPERIENCE- WE ARE

02:53:10.513 --> 02:53:12.615
NOT IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW AT

FACT ITS GOOD INTENTIONS. BUT

02:53:20.189 --> 02:53:22.158
TWENTY WATER. PROGRAM I'M IN

02:53:22.225 --> 02:53:23.860

02:53:23.926 --> 02:53:25.995
SCIENTIFICALLY ROBUST IN THE

THAT ALREADY IS LOOKING AT

DRINKING WATER GIVEN THE

02:53:38.508 --> 02:53:39.942
STATE'S GOALS AROUND USING

PURPOSES. NO CLEAN WATER ACTION

02:53:43.946 --> 02:53:45.414

SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF OUR

02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:49.252
REGULATORY PROCESS. DESPITE THE

02:53:49.318 --> 02:53:50.987
FACT THAT IT DOES SLOW DOWN

02:53:51.053 --> 02:53:52.488

WATER. BUT IT'S BEEN OUR

02:53:56.926 --> 02:53:59.495
EXPERIENCE THAT REGULATIONS CAN

02:53:59.562 --> 02:54:01.497
OFTEN TAKE OVER A DECADE TO

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:04.000
FINALIZE. AND THAT IS PARTIALLY

02:54:04.066 --> 02:54:06.135
DUE TO THE MONITORING FOR

02:54:06.202 --> 02:54:07.370

TO IN FACT. THOUGH

02:54:33.262 --> 02:54:35.331
UNINTENTIONALLY- THERE'S A SLOW

02:54:35.398 --> 02:54:36.899
DOWN NEEDED PROTECTIONS FOR THE

02:54:36.966 --> 02:54:38.935

DIALOGUE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON.

02:54:57.854 --> 02:54:59.622
WE COULD PERHAPS SUPPORT A

02:54:59.689 --> 02:55:01.057
PROGRAM THAT EXPANDS THE

02:55:01.123 --> 02:55:02.458
CURRENT STATE BOARDS EASY

02:55:02.525 --> 02:55:04.527
PROGRAM TO LOOK AT NON DRINKING

02:55:04.594 --> 02:55:06.429
WATER ISSUES. THAT ARE NOT AS

02:55:06.495 --> 02:55:09.098
WELL SUPPORTED SCIENTIFICALLY

02:55:09.165 --> 02:55:09.599
AS IS THE DRINKING WATER

02:55:09.665 --> 02:55:12.668
PROGRAM- AS IT IS CONCEIVED AS

02:55:12.735 --> 02:55:14.070
PART OF THE DRINKING WATER

02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:19.742
PROGRAM THOUGH- RIGHT NOW WE DO.

WE CAN THE- WE WILL. TO

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:29.552
DIALOGUE- GET THE BILL MOVES

EVERYBODY INVOLVED FOR- FOR YOU

02:55:38.995 --> 02:55:39.929
KNOW FIRST I DO WANT TO I WANT

02:55:39.996 --> 02:55:41.397
TO GENERALLY THINK DEPOSITION

02:55:41.464 --> 02:55:42.164
FOR BRINGING UP WHAT I THOUGHT

02:55:42.231 --> 02:55:43.366
WERE SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS

02:55:43.432 --> 02:55:44.400
I'M I'VE BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:46.202
WITH THE PEACE PROCESS US FOLKS

TAKE. BECAUSE OF THE BILL

02:55:56.245 --> 02:55:57.580
BECAUSE THE UNIDADE DEFIANCE IS

02:55:57.647 --> 02:55:58.981
NOT AN EMERGING AREA OF CONCERN

02:55:59.048 --> 02:56:00.549
IS AN ESTABLISHED AND PRETTY

02:56:00.616 --> 02:56:02.585
WELL KNOWN AREA OF CONCERN. AND

02:56:02.652 --> 02:56:03.586
THE CONTAMINANTS SIDE AND

02:56:03.653 --> 02:56:04.587
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I

02:56:04.654 --> 02:56:05.488
WORK SO CLOSELY WITH THE

02:56:05.554 --> 02:56:07.556

DELAYING ABOUT CONFLICTS AND

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:21.771
THAT'S ONE OF THE- MANY REASONS

02:56:21.837 --> 02:56:22.605
WHY WE ALSO ARE WORKING ON.

02:56:22.672 --> 02:56:24.173
LANGUAGE IN THOSE TWO AREAS TOO

02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:26.275
SO ANYWAY- OTHER FOLKS WANT TO

02:56:26.342 --> 02:56:27.376
RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL

02:56:27.443 --> 02:56:30.112

MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WOULD

02:57:11.821 --> 02:57:14.890
LIKE TO. ASK A QUESTION OF THE

02:57:14.957 --> 02:57:16.192
AUTHORIZED THIS IS AN AREA I

02:57:16.258 --> 02:57:17.626
DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND SO I

02:57:17.693 --> 02:57:19.295
JUST NEED SOME CLARIFICATION ON.

02:57:19.362 --> 02:57:22.465
UNTIL HOW DOES THAT. THE CC

02:57:22.531 --> 02:57:25.334

THAT OUTLINES. THE SELECTION

02:57:40.516 --> 02:57:42.118
PROCESS AND I THINK THAT THE

02:57:42.184 --> 02:57:43.486
OPPOSITION'S BIGGEST CONCERN IS

02:57:43.552 --> 02:57:44.854

INDICATED- THE EPA THE USEPA

03:09:23.685 --> 03:09:25.854
GUIDELINES. ALSO CONSIDERED THE

03:09:25.921 --> 03:09:27.889

WATER- BOARD REGULATIONS THAT

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:38.633
WOULD PROVIDE FOR THAT. BUT

03:09:38.700 --> 03:09:40.602

CAN BE UNITS FORMED. THAT THERE

03:09:54.716 --> 03:09:56.017
WOULD BE A UNIFORM AND RATIONAL

03:09:56.084 --> 03:10:00.756
BASIS FOR DETERMINING- WHAT IS

03:10:00.822 --> 03:10:03.391
IN FACT A REASONABLE TIME FRAME

03:10:03.458 --> 03:10:04.559

TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS- DENTURE

03:10:28.583 --> 03:10:29.918
BREATH TESTAMENT WHICH IS WHY I

HOW FAR A MANUFACTURER GOES IN

03:16:21.302 --> 03:16:22.804
REDESIGNING OR RE FORMULATING A

03:16:22.871 --> 03:16:25.406

INCREDIBLY SLOW AND IT'S PARTLY

03:16:45.193 --> 03:16:46.961
DUE TO DATA GAPS THAT HINDER

PUTTING A KNOWN. TOXIC CHEMICAL

03:25:41.362 --> 03:25:43.531
OUT THERE THAT- IS IN VIOLATION

03:25:43.597 --> 03:25:46.667
CLEAR VIOLATION. ANALYSTS SAY-

03:25:46.734 --> 03:25:48.769
YEAH THE VERY SINISTER GROUPS

03:25:48.836 --> 03:25:49.336
WHO WOULD HAVE MOST TO FEAR

03:25:49.403 --> 03:25:52.740

YOUR ORIGINAL TESTIMONY YOU

SAID THAT THAT THE YOU KNOW THE

03:25:59.513 --> 03:26:00.481
PROCESS HASN'T REALLY WORKED

03:26:00.548 --> 03:26:02.450
OUT WELL AND IS THERE MUST BE

03:26:02.516 --> 03:26:04.585
SOME DEBATE OR SOME. THE BILL

03:26:04.652 --> 03:26:06.487
BILLY NOT GET INFORMATION OR

03:26:06.554 --> 03:26:07.488
HAVE INFORMATION BUT THE

03:26:07.555 --> 03:26:08.989
PRODUCTS ARE STILL. BEING THERE

03:26:09.056 --> 03:26:10.324
SO I MISS MY CONCERN IS IT'S

03:26:10.391 --> 03:26:12.693
LIKE. I REALLY DON'T LIKE

03:26:12.760 --> 03:26:13.794
AGENCIES HAVE AN ABILITY TO

03:26:13.861 --> 03:26:14.762
FIND THE MONEY GOES BACK TO

03:26:14.829 --> 03:26:16.731
THEM IT'S THERE'S AN INCENTIVE

03:26:16.797 --> 03:26:18.966
FOR THEM TO FIND IF THAT'S- THE

03:26:19.033 --> 03:26:20.501
SCENARIO WE SEE NOT AND OTHER

03:26:20.568 --> 03:26:22.069
AGENCIES WHERE THEY- KEEP THOSE

03:26:22.136 --> 03:26:23.504
REASON. THOSE MONIES IN THEIR

03:26:23.571 --> 03:26:26.173
COFFERS AND SO. THERE'S AN

03:26:26.240 --> 03:26:28.008
INCENTIVE TO FIND WHEN YOU.

03:26:28.075 --> 03:26:29.510
DON'T HAVE A GOING BACK YOUR

03:26:29.577 --> 03:26:30.678
COFFERS THERE'S LESS INCENTIVE

03:26:30.745 --> 03:26:31.946
FOR YOU TO FIND AND ACTUALLY

03:26:32.012 --> 03:26:35.683
GET TO THE RESULT. THAT'S MY

03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:39.153
PERSPECTIVE. THE FIRM HAS

03:26:39.220 --> 03:26:42.022
CONCEPTS BY EMINEM I'M WILLING

03:26:42.089 --> 03:26:44.058
TO MOVE TO THE BILL I MEAN I

03:26:44.125 --> 03:26:46.861
THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING BY

03:26:46.927 --> 03:26:49.230
PROTECTING TRADE SECRETS BUT

03:26:49.296 --> 03:26:51.098
ALLOWING PRODUCT INGREDIENTS TO

03:26:51.165 --> 03:26:52.933
GET THERE IT'S A TRICKY IT'S A

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:54.301
TRICKY PROCEDURE FOR YOU CAN

03:26:54.368 --> 03:26:55.703
HAVE THE SCIENTISTS LOOK AT IT

03:26:55.770 --> 03:26:57.638
JUST SO THAT THEY CAN ANALYZE

03:26:57.705 --> 03:26:59.173
THE HARMFUL EFFECTS AND I

03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:01.075
PLUGGED IT IN OBVIOUSLY

03:27:01.142 --> 03:27:05.112
ADMINISTRATIVE A- EFFICIENCIES

03:27:05.179 --> 03:27:06.180
IS ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING ON%

03:27:06.247 --> 03:27:08.215
LOOK FOR BUT I THINK MISTER

03:27:08.282 --> 03:27:09.550
CHAIRMAN AND AUTHOR YOU'RE A

03:27:09.617 --> 03:27:10.885
LITTLE BIT TOO HARSH ON

03:27:10.951 --> 03:27:12.853
YOURSELF AS FAR AS- IS FAR AS

03:27:12.920 --> 03:27:15.656
THE- SUCCESS OF THE GREEN

03:27:15.723 --> 03:27:17.725
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM AND- AND IT

03:27:17.792 --> 03:27:20.094
IS A- UNIQUE. ONE OF A KIND IN

03:27:20.161 --> 03:27:21.862
THE WORLD WHEN IT GOT CAUGHT UP

03:27:21.929 --> 03:27:25.132
CAUGHT BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF

03:27:25.199 --> 03:27:28.903
PRODUCERS. CENTER PICK MAKING

03:27:28.969 --> 03:27:30.337
SAFER. ATTACKS AND USING LESS

03:27:30.404 --> 03:27:31.572
HARMFUL PRODUCTS AS LONG AS

03:27:31.639 --> 03:27:32.940
IT'S STILL CLEANS MY HOUSE

03:27:33.007 --> 03:27:34.074
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

03:27:34.141 --> 03:27:35.442
ON THAT LIST THEY DON'T WANT TO

03:27:35.509 --> 03:27:37.111
BE A CHEMICAL OF CONCERN THEY

03:27:37.178 --> 03:27:38.078
WERE THERE LOOKING FOR

03:27:38.145 --> 03:27:39.847
ALTERNATIVES SO WELL WE MAY NOT

03:27:39.914 --> 03:27:42.516
HAVE A- BODY COUNT HERE AT DGSE

03:27:42.583 --> 03:27:44.752
ABOUT. THE CHEMICALS ARE OUT

03:27:44.819 --> 03:27:46.687
THE INDUSTRY HAS SORT OF SELF

03:27:46.754 --> 03:27:48.422
CORRECTED AS BEST THEY CAN

03:27:48.489 --> 03:27:49.957
THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY THEY'LL

03:27:50.024 --> 03:27:51.559
BE PEOPLE COME AND SAY WE HAVE

03:27:51.625 --> 03:27:55.029
TO USES BUT- THE- THE- TOTAL

03:27:55.095 --> 03:27:56.564
AMOUNT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A

03:27:56.630 --> 03:27:58.098
SUCCESS AND I THINK. THESE ARE

03:27:58.165 --> 03:28:01.902
IMPROVEMENTS. TO STATE AND SEE

03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:03.771
WHAT THAT'LL HOLD THE BILL. I

03:28:03.838 --> 03:28:06.073
DO HAVE A QUESTION OR A COMMENT

03:28:06.140 --> 03:28:08.475
OF SENATOR ALLEN I DO BELIEVE-

03:28:08.542 --> 03:28:09.543
THE PENALTIES ARE EXCEEDINGLY

03:28:09.610 --> 03:28:11.412
HIGH. IT WHAT TROUBLES ME ABOUT

03:28:11.478 --> 03:28:12.880
THEM AND THEY SEEM TO BE TIED

03:28:12.947 --> 03:28:14.548
TO AN AUTHORITY THEY DE TFC

03:28:14.615 --> 03:28:17.585
HAVE- IF THEY AREN'T. YOU KNOW

03:28:17.651 --> 03:28:18.752
LET'S SAY CONVINCED BY THE

03:28:18.819 --> 03:28:20.387
ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS THEY'RE

03:28:20.454 --> 03:28:22.690
ALLOWED- THAT MANUFACTURES

03:28:22.756 --> 03:28:23.691
ALLOWED TO MAKE THEY CAN

03:28:23.757 --> 03:28:25.359
ACTUALLY ARE. YOU KNOW

03:28:25.426 --> 03:28:28.028
SUPERSEDE THAT AND DO THEIR OWN

03:28:28.095 --> 03:28:29.463
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT

03:28:29.530 --> 03:28:32.533
THERE'S A- POTENTIAL FOR AN

03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:35.603
SANTA. ANA VERY LARGE FINE. ART

03:28:35.669 --> 03:28:36.670

YOU PRESENTED TO US SO WE'RE

03:28:38.038 --> 03:28:39.707
GOING TO GO TO OUR OWN OUR-

03:28:39.773 --> 03:28:41.108
SOURCES AND GET ANOTHER

03:28:41.175 --> 03:28:42.910
ANALYSIS PHILIP FEELS A

03:28:42.977 --> 03:28:43.844
DIFFERENT DOES THAT PERSON

03:28:43.911 --> 03:28:46.580
DOWN- IF THAT PERSON SUBJECTED

03:28:46.647 --> 03:28:48.549
TO A FINE ENOUGH NOT CLEARLY

03:28:48.616 --> 03:28:51.018
DEFINED ENOUGH. SO I THINK ARE

03:28:51.085 --> 03:28:53.254
THERE NEEDS TO BE A TIGHTER-

03:28:53.320 --> 03:28:55.222
RESTRICTION ON IT WHEN THOSE

03:28:55.289 --> 03:28:57.825
PENALTIES APPLY. AND WHAT AND

03:28:57.892 --> 03:29:00.060
NOW THE FEES ON. MEET THE

03:29:00.127 --> 03:29:01.862
STANDARDS HEAD DOES SEEM TO BE

03:29:01.929 --> 03:29:03.631
A LITTLE LOOSE IN THE WAY

03:29:03.697 --> 03:29:05.566
THEY'VE CONSTRUCTED AND I KNOW.

03:29:05.633 --> 03:29:07.301
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON

03:29:07.368 --> 03:29:08.836
THAT FOR SENATE CHALLENGE TO

03:29:08.903 --> 03:29:10.237
GET BUSINESS OPPOSITION OFF

03:29:10.304 --> 03:29:11.672
BECAUSE I REMEMBER IT FROM.

03:29:11.739 --> 03:29:13.274
LAST YEAR BUT THOSE ARE STILL

03:29:13.340 --> 03:29:15.643
PROBLEM AREAS FOR ME. ARE YOU

03:29:15.709 --> 03:29:17.311
JUST IT IT MAKES ME CONCERNED

03:29:17.378 --> 03:29:18.379
THAT IT'LL TURN OUT TO BE

03:29:18.445 --> 03:29:20.414
SOMETHING LIKE PAGA. WHERE YOU

03:29:20.481 --> 03:29:21.415

03:29:30.291 --> 03:29:32.559
JUST LAY OFF. BY IT DOES COME

03:29:32.626 --> 03:29:33.560

MY WORK. BETWEEN NOW. AND THEN

03:29:43.103 --> 03:29:43.637

03:29:55.382 --> 03:29:57.985

03:29:58.052 --> 03:29:59.053
NECESSARY IN TERMS OF

THE COMPANY JUST. OUT NOT

03:30:02.856 --> 03:30:04.558
REFUSES TO. COMPLY WITH

03:30:04.625 --> 03:30:06.393
INFORMATION REQUESTS. AND THEY

03:30:06.460 --> 03:30:08.429
MAKE A REASONABLE EFFORT TO GET

03:30:08.495 --> 03:30:09.897
THEM TO COMPLY WHAT WHAT OTHER

03:30:09.964 --> 03:30:12.366
WHAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE DO I

03:30:12.433 --> 03:30:12.933
MEAN SHOULD WE DO IT REALLY

03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:15.402
JUST. TELL THE COMPANY THAT YOU

03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:16.971

IMPORTANT INFORMATION OR- IS

03:30:21.608 --> 03:30:22.710
THERE THAT IS A DIFFERENT WAY

03:30:22.776 --> 03:30:24.278
TO ENFORCE I GUESS THAT'S MY

03:30:24.345 --> 03:30:26.013
THANK YOU CAN APPROACH THE FINE

03:30:26.080 --> 03:30:28.215
MEDIAN ECONOMIC. TEARS SO IF WE

CAN USE THAT PART. THE BASE.

03:30:31.018 --> 03:30:32.619
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE OUT

03:30:32.686 --> 03:30:35.422
RIGHT OR GOING TO REFUSE- BUT I

03:30:35.489 --> 03:30:36.991
DO THINK THERE THERE CAN BE A

03:30:37.057 --> 03:30:38.926
DISPUTE CLEARLY BETWEEN MY

03:30:38.993 --> 03:30:40.627
ANALYSES THAT I PROVIDED YOU

03:30:40.694 --> 03:30:42.763
AND YOU NOT ACCEPTING IT. AND

03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:44.164
THAT'S WHERE THE AGENCIES KIND

03:30:44.231 --> 03:30:47.334
OF BECOME THE RULING CLASS ON

03:30:47.401 --> 03:30:49.503
ON OUR BUSINESSES LIKE I DON'T

LIKE WHICH YOU PROVIDED ME

03:30:50.304 --> 03:30:52.306
THEREFORE- I NEED SOMETHING

03:30:52.373 --> 03:30:54.375
DIFFERENT AND I. I DO THINK

03:30:54.441 --> 03:30:55.376
THAT THAT WILL OCCUR BUT THAT

03:30:55.442 --> 03:30:57.111
BUT THAT'S JUST INEVITABLE SO

03:30:57.177 --> 03:30:58.846

03:31:02.249 --> 03:31:03.217
TO MEET IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY

03:31:03.283 --> 03:31:04.685
PROVIDE YOU. DID THEY GO OUT

03:31:04.752 --> 03:31:06.687
AND SEEK SCIENTIFIC ANALYSES OR

03:31:06.754 --> 03:31:08.222
DID THEY JUST TAKE IT IN HOUSE

03:31:08.288 --> 03:31:09.223
AND EVERYBODY DECIDED WILL

03:31:09.289 --> 03:31:10.691
SHOOT WE'VE HAD THAT THE

DOZENS OF PEOPLE THERE'S NO

03:31:13.560 --> 03:31:14.795
DATA TO SUPPORT THAT. WHERE IS

03:31:14.862 --> 03:31:16.497
THE TFC WOULD HAVE SOME NEW

03:31:16.563 --> 03:31:17.931
VERY UPDATED INFORMATION THAT

03:31:17.998 --> 03:31:19.666
YEAH THAT IS THAT THE FUNDING

03:31:19.733 --> 03:31:21.235
THAT'S NOW CREATED A WHOLE

03:31:21.301 --> 03:31:22.302

REMEDY LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.

03:31:44.158 --> 03:31:45.759
MOST OFTEN THEY'RE NOT GIVEN

03:31:45.826 --> 03:31:48.028
THAT THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY THE

03:31:48.095 --> 03:31:50.364
THAT THE- CLOCK TICKS ON THEM

03:31:50.431 --> 03:31:51.565

PANDEMIC. WE'VE GOT

03:32:17.724 --> 03:32:18.992
MANUFACTURES THIRTY YOU TO GEAR

IS THAT WE KNOW THERE'S DAM

03:33:02.002 --> 03:33:03.604
DANGEROUS THIRD INTEREST

03:33:03.670 --> 03:33:06.039
CHEMICALS OUT THERE- YOU THE IF

03:33:06.106 --> 03:33:07.441
THE AGENCY DOES ITS OWN

03:33:07.508 --> 03:33:08.909
ANALYSIS BY THE WAY THERE'S NO

03:33:08.976 --> 03:33:09.710
FINE I MEAN THIS IS LITERALLY

03:33:09.776 --> 03:33:13.647
JUST TO ALLOW THEM. TO GET THE

03:33:13.714 --> 03:33:16.083
INFORMATION THEY NEED- AND

03:33:16.150 --> 03:33:19.019
THERE IS. A CLEAR DELINEATION-

03:33:19.086 --> 03:33:21.021
IN IN THE BILL SECTION FIVE

03:33:21.088 --> 03:33:23.390
THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW HAPPY

THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN. TO

03:33:28.362 --> 03:33:30.931

03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:35.469
OF GOOSE CHASE. YEAH WELL STILL

03:33:35.536 --> 03:33:36.036
I MEAN THE OTHER DAY WHAT'S

03:33:36.103 --> 03:33:37.204
WHAT'S GONNA REPORT TO ME AND

03:33:37.271 --> 03:33:39.206
WHEN I'M NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY

03:33:39.273 --> 03:33:41.675
TO COMPROMISE ON IS IT. IS

03:33:41.742 --> 03:33:45.012
MAKING IT SO THAT. IN THE- THE

03:33:45.078 --> 03:33:46.446
COMPANY'S CAN'T HEAR MY MIGHT

03:33:46.513 --> 03:33:48.815
GIVE THE- THE DEPARTMENT. TOO

03:33:48.882 --> 03:33:49.917
MUCH OF A RUN AROUND AS THEY

03:33:49.983 --> 03:33:51.351
TRY TO DO THEIR WORK AND AS WE

03:33:51.418 --> 03:33:52.953
SAY. THIS WHOLE PROGRAM HAS

03:33:53.020 --> 03:33:54.021
GOTTEN BOGGED DOWN OVER THE

03:33:54.087 --> 03:33:55.889
LAST TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS NOW.

03:33:55.956 --> 03:33:59.359
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH. THE

03:33:59.426 --> 03:34:00.093
AGENCY DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS

03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:03.931
IT NEEDS. TO TAKE TO GET THIS

03:34:03.997 --> 03:34:06.400
INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS-

03:34:06.466 --> 03:34:08.468
SO WHAT COMES TO APPROPRIATIONS

03:34:08.535 --> 03:34:10.771
SUB FINISH OUR FULL IN BETWEEN

03:34:10.837 --> 03:34:13.941
NOW AND THEN LET'S HAVE OUR

03:34:14.007 --> 03:34:14.708
STAFF CHATTER I CAN TRICK YOU

03:34:14.775 --> 03:34:16.143
ACTUALLY T. OKAY BECAUSE I

03:34:16.210 --> 03:34:17.477
DIDN'T READ PAGE WHATEVER IT

03:34:17.544 --> 03:34:21.148
WATER SHOULD NOT. FULLER WOULD

03:34:21.215 --> 03:34:22.849
YOU LIKE TO THE TO PROVIDE YOUR

03:34:22.916 --> 03:34:24.351
CLOTHES YEAH I KNOW HAPPY SO

03:34:24.418 --> 03:34:26.153
HAPPY TO WORK WITH MY CALL I'M

03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:27.287
SORRY IT IS A GROUP THAT'S

03:34:27.354 --> 03:34:28.322
GOING TO GIVE YOU A SCENARIO

03:34:28.388 --> 03:34:33.393
OF. THOSE SO CALLED- THE METAL

03:34:33.460 --> 03:34:34.895
BROMIDE. I'M SURE YOU'RE

03:34:34.962 --> 03:34:35.429
FAMILIAR WITH THAT IF YOU

03:34:35.495 --> 03:34:37.998
AGAINST IT NEVER CULTURE USES.

03:34:38.065 --> 03:34:40.133
ARE USED TO USE I SHOULD SAY.

03:34:40.200 --> 03:34:43.003
AND YOU KNOW. THEY WENT THROUGH

03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:44.738
ALL KINDS OF REGULATORY.

03:34:44.805 --> 03:34:46.607
HURDLES AND BASICALLY DID TO

03:34:46.673 --> 03:34:48.575
ERADICATE METHYL BROMIDE WHICH

03:34:48.642 --> 03:34:50.978
IS VERY CRITICAL TO. KEEPING

03:34:51.044 --> 03:34:54.248
MEMENTOS AND STRAWBERRIES AND

03:34:54.314 --> 03:34:55.782
THEIR THEIR SEASON AMMONS AND

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:57.517
THEN THERE'S REALLY NOT OTHER

03:34:57.584 --> 03:35:01.255
VERY GOOD- ALTERNATIVES. AND IT

03:35:01.321 --> 03:35:03.657
MESSED IT NATURALLY OCCURS AT

03:35:03.724 --> 03:35:05.592
80% WORLDWIDE IS A NATURALLY

03:35:05.659 --> 03:35:08.895
OCCURRING THE GASES THAT COME

03:35:08.962 --> 03:35:11.231
FROM NOT THE BROMIDE. AND SO MY

03:35:11.298 --> 03:35:13.033
CONCERN IS EXACTLY OKAY WHAT

03:35:13.100 --> 03:35:14.201
HAPPENS WHEN YOU GOT IT WE HAVE

03:35:14.268 --> 03:35:15.469
A PRODUCT THAT THERE IS NO

03:35:15.535 --> 03:35:17.304
OTHER ALTERNATIVE. ALL RIGHT

03:35:17.371 --> 03:35:19.339
EVEN THOUGH WE ALL WANT TO FIND

03:35:19.406 --> 03:35:20.140
SOME OTHER ALTERNATE BUT THERE

03:35:20.207 --> 03:35:23.877
ISN'T AN ALTERNATIVE. THEN

03:35:23.944 --> 03:35:24.511
WHAT'S THE PROCESS AFTER THAT.

03:35:24.578 --> 03:35:25.846
I JUST USED BUILT THE BERLIN IS

03:35:25.912 --> 03:35:27.381
NOT PROBABLY IN THIS CATEGORY

03:35:27.447 --> 03:35:29.349
BUT WELL RIGHT WHAT WHAT WHAT

03:35:29.416 --> 03:35:31.184
WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR THOSE.

03:35:31.251 --> 03:35:32.653
COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVE A

03:35:32.719 --> 03:35:34.721
PRODUCT IN OBVIOUSLY THE REASON

03:35:34.788 --> 03:35:36.623
THAT WE'VE SEEN THE DELAY FOR

03:35:36.690 --> 03:35:37.457
ALL THESE YEARS IS THERE

03:35:37.524 --> 03:35:38.425
STRAIGHT THERE'S ALL KINDS OF

03:35:38.492 --> 03:35:40.360
USE LIKE WD FORTY. DO WE REALLY

03:35:40.427 --> 03:35:41.862
KNOW WHAT SENATE BUT WE KNOW

03:35:41.928 --> 03:35:44.197
THAT IT TOOK HIM FORTY TRIES TO

03:35:44.264 --> 03:35:45.832
GET. WATER DISPLACEMENT- AND

03:35:45.899 --> 03:35:47.167
THERE WAS ACTUALLY LAWSUIT OVER

03:35:47.234 --> 03:35:48.969
THAT YEARS AGO ABOUT. PEOPLE

03:35:49.036 --> 03:35:50.804
WANTING TO KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT

03:35:50.871 --> 03:35:51.338
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

03:35:51.405 --> 03:35:52.606
DUPLICATE IT SO. I WANNA GO

03:35:52.673 --> 03:35:53.940
DOWN THAT ROUTE TROUBLED MY I

03:35:54.007 --> 03:35:56.176
GUESS MY QUESTION IS WORK

03:35:56.243 --> 03:35:58.812
WHAT'S THE ABILITY. FOR THE

03:35:58.879 --> 03:36:00.514
PRODUCERS TO BE ABLE TO SAY HEY

03:36:00.580 --> 03:36:03.317
THAT THERE'S JUST NO. THERE'S

03:36:03.383 --> 03:36:06.053
NO OTHER- ALTERNATE. YEAH WELL

03:36:06.119 --> 03:36:07.654
THAT I MEAN IT'S SO THAT'S

03:36:07.721 --> 03:36:09.423
THAT'S SORT OF DOWN THE- I MEAN

03:36:09.489 --> 03:36:10.857
THAT THAT'S DOWN THE DOWNTHE

03:36:10.924 --> 03:36:11.925
LINE RIGHT AND WE'RE TALKING

03:36:11.992 --> 03:36:13.260
ABOUT JUST GATHERING THE

03:36:13.327 --> 03:36:16.330
INFORMATION AT THIS POINT- HERO

03:36:16.396 --> 03:36:18.465
BY THE NEAR THE DAY IT'S- THE

03:36:18.532 --> 03:36:20.667
REGULATORY RESPONSE VANS. IT'S

03:36:20.734 --> 03:36:24.237
ALL ABOUT MITIGATING EXPOSURE-

03:36:24.304 --> 03:36:26.740
FOR THE PUBLIC. AND IF THERE IS

03:36:26.807 --> 03:36:27.941
NOT A GOOD ALTERNATIVE AND BY

03:36:28.008 --> 03:36:29.276
THE WAY ANOTHER THING THAT WE

03:36:29.343 --> 03:36:32.012
TALKED ABOUT DURING OUR LAST

03:36:32.079 --> 03:36:32.646
DISCUSSION AGREE CHEMISTRY IS.

03:36:32.713 --> 03:36:34.614
YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IS

03:36:34.681 --> 03:36:36.183
WE YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET RID OF

03:36:36.249 --> 03:36:37.684
ONE CHEMICAL AND THEN. THERE'S

03:36:37.751 --> 03:36:38.919
NOT A THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE
