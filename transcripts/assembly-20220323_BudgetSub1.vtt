COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC. OF THE

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.120
FIRST ONE OF COURSE WAS THE

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:39.963
. THE NEXT PART OF THE QUESTION

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.065
SPEAKS TO THE NUTRITION GAP IN

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:44.634
CALIFORNIA. SO I'D LIKE TO POINT

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:46.236
YOU TO RECENT STUDIES THAT HAVE

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:48.104
BEEN CONDUCTED TO ATTEMPT TO

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:49.806
QUANTIFY THE NUTRITION GAP IN

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:52.108
CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST STUDY IS

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:53.443
FROM THE NATIONAL ON PROFIT

HUNGER IN AMERICA. IN THE REPORT

00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:03.553
THERE'S A TABLE THAT SHOWS THE

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.889
FOOD INSECURITY RATE BY STATE.

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.858
THEIR LATEST REPORT WHICH COVERS

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:09.926
CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN

00:52:09.993 --> 00:52:11.828

POPULATION EXPERIENCES SOME

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:17.801
LEVEL OF FOOD INSECURITY. AND

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:21.872
ONE POINT 9% EXPERIENCED VERY

00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:22.873
LOW AFTER THE SECURITY. THE

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:25.509
SECOND REPORT I'D LIKE TO POINT

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:26.476

THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:32.516
ON BEHALF OF C. FOR A WHICH IS

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:34.718
THE FIXATION THAT REPRESENTS

AUGMENTATIONS. THE STATE WAS

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.274
SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO REDUCE THIS

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.110

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:30.692
AND WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.527
HER. CENTERS ALSO CONTINUE TO

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:33.729
FACE CHALLENGES PROVIDING

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.731
SERVICES TO KEEP PARTICIPANTS AS

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:38.600
SAFE AS POSSIBLE POST PANDEMIC.

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:41.069
AS WE KNOW FRAIL ELDERS ARE THE

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.938
MOST VULNERABLE TO COPE IT AND

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.773
ARE HIGHER RISK OF DEATH FROM

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.909
INFECTION CENTERS HAVE REMAINED

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:48.944
OPEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:50.979
THEY'VE HAD TO RELY ON TEMPORARY

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:53.382
APPROVED EMERGENCY SERVICES

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:55.183
THROUGH THE STATE AND PERHAPS TO

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:56.385
HAVE PROVIDED FOR SOCIAL

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.687
DISTANCING AND INFECTION CONTROL

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.289
AND INCREASED INFECTION CONTROL

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:01.790
TO KEEP THE SENIORS THAT. HAVE

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.125
BEEN COMING IN POTENTIALLY EVEN

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:05.727
ON A ONE ON WAIT ONE BASIS TO

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:08.363
THE CENTER SAFELY. SO AS WE MOVE

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.965
FROM PANDEMIC TO ENDEMIC AND

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:12.134
RETURN TO CENTER. THEY HAVE TO

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.770
BE ABLE TO RETURN TO CENTER IN

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:17.406
FULL CAPACITY. SO THEY NEED TO

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:19.374
MAKE NECESSARY MODIFICATIONS TO

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.109
THEIR PHYSICAL SPACES TO HARDEN

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.811
THEIR SPACES TO ALLOW THIS TO

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.913
HAPPEN. IT INCLUDES IMPROVING

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.782
VENTILATION SYSTEMS MODIFYING

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:29.952
INDOOR SPACES THANK YOU KNOW

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.920
ALLOWING FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:34.056
REPLACING WINDOWS AND UTILIZING

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:36.325
OUTDOOR SPACES IN WAYS THEY MAY

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:38.160
NOT HAVE HAD TO USE THEM BEFORE.

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.561
THEY ALSO HAVE THE HARD THE

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:41.229
CENTERS IN CASE THERE ARE FUTURE

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:45.100
PUBLIC EMERGENCIES. AND EVEN

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.501
PREPARE FOR THINGS LIKE

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.437
WILDFIRES. ALL OF THESE ARE

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:49.905
UNBUDGETED EXPENSES THAT

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:52.374
FACILITIES HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:53.809
OUT OF POCKET DURING THE

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.243
PANDEMIC. ANOTHER HUGE ISSUE

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:57.546
THAT THE CENTERS ARE FACING AS

01:16:57.612 --> 01:16:59.448
TRANSPORTATION AND I HAVE SOME

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:02.017
EXAMPLES ON NOT- IN SAN

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:04.052
FRANCISCO TO RETURN TO CENTER.

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.887
TO GET PARA TRANSIT READY FOR

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.924
PARTICIPANTS IT CAN TAKE UP TO

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:09.891
SIXTY DAYS IF IT'S EVEN

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:12.894
AVAILABLE- IN OXNARD I HAVE A

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:15.864
CENTER. WHERE THEIR DRIVERS ARE

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:18.567
BEING STOLEN AT GAS STATIONS AND

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:20.268
RECRUITED BY FEDERAL EXPRESS SO

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:22.237
THEY REALLY HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.506
TRANSPORTATION GOING. AND THEN

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.274
THE L. A. N. ORANGE COUNTY

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:27.275
CENTERS HAVE ANOTHER UNIQUE

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:29.011
PROBLEM THEIR CATALYTIC

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:31.213
CONVERTERS KEEP GETTING STOLEN.

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:33.015
AND AS SOON AS THEY REPLACE THEM

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.583
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE IN GATED.

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:36.818
AND IN THESE AREAS THAT THEY

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:40.355
JUST KEEP HAVING TO REPLACE THEM

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:42.324
AGAIN. SO ALLOCATING FUNDING IN

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:43.892
NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET TO CREATE

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.327
GRANTS FOR THE FACILITIES TO

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.294
TACKLE THESE EXPENSIVE

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:47.996
CHALLENGES WOULD BE A

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:50.298
SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD. AT THE

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:52.200
END OF THE DAY THE STATE NEEDS

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.102
TO INVEST IN ADULT DAY SERVICES

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:55.237
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THESE

01:17:55.303 --> 01:17:57.339
SERVICES SAVE LIVES AND KEEP

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.307
SENIORS OUT OF NURSING HOMES.

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:01.510
THEY KEEP THEM OUT OF ISOLATION

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:03.745
AND IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:06.181
CAN SURVIVE AND THRIVE. THANK

THAT ARE DELIVERED AND WE KNOW

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.016

CHALLENGES FACING OUR NETWORK. I

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.438
THINK THE GROWTH IN THE

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:46.208
COMPLEXITY OF CARE TODAY AS AS

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:48.243
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIVE LONGER

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:50.979
WE HAVE THE SECOND. LONGEST

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:53.615
LIFESPAN IN THE NATION- THAT

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.317
COMES WITH MORE COMPLEX CARE

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:57.152
NEEDS IN THE AIR IN OF

SPECIFICALLY AS KAREN MENTIONED-

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.390
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ALZHEIMER'S

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:04.092
AND DEMENTIA AS MICHAEL COSTA

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:07.629
MENTIONED- AND A DECLINE IN THE

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.231
NUMBER OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:10.966
ARE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:13.335
AT HOME. WHICH PLACES A HIGHER

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:15.136
RELIANCE ON THE DIRECT CARE WORK

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:17.906
FORCE. US TO THOSE ARE SOME OF

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:19.107
THE LEADING CHALLENGES THAT

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.976
WE'RE- WORKING ON AS A

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:22.811
DEPARTMENT AND ALSO IN

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:25.580
PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:26.581
DEPARTMENTS AND THE PRIVATE

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:28.216
SECTOR. IT WILL MISS WORST

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:31.886
WONDER. I'M GONNA CONCUR WITH

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.388
DIRECTOR DEMAREST THAT IT'S

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.924
DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE ONE- THE

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:37.559
COMMISSION HAS A STRATEGIC PLAN

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.394
AND WE HAD PRIORITIES BUT

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.830
ACTUALLY WE- AT THE END OF LAST

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:43.131
YEAR WE REALIZED ALL THESE NEW

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:45.100
ISSUES WERE COMING TO THE

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.568
FOREFRONT SO THAT'S WHY WE

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.136
PRIORITIZE THOSE FOUR AREAS. AND

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.571
IN PARTICULAR OLDER ADULT

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.072
BEHAVIOR HEALTH I MEAN THE

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:53.141
PANDEMIC JUST RAISE THE PROFILE

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:55.210
OF THE IMPACT ON OLDER ADULTS

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.578
THEN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.079
ISSUES AND MENTIONED THAT FOR

01:21:58.146 --> 01:21:59.648
FASTEST GROWING POPULATION IS

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:01.349
FIFTH AGE FIFTY AND OLDER AND

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.551
THEN WORKFORCE THAT REALLY CAME

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.153
TO THE FOREFRONT SO. IF I HAD TO

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.522
PICK MY TOP THREE IT WOULD BE

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.257
THERE BUT ALSO NUTRITION IT S

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:10.158
HARD TO CHOOSE THERE'S SO MANY

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:11.793
COMPETING NEEDS BUT THAT'S HOW

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.428
THE COMMISSION PRIORITIZED OUR

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:16.798
OUR RESOURCES AND FOCUS-

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:17.999
DIRECTOR OMINOUS. WITH SENIOR

NUTRITION AND FOLLOW UP ON THE

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:22.003
L. A. O.'S QUESTION IF I CAN.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.838
WHAT'S GOING TO OCCUR WHEN THESE

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:26.107
ONE TIME FUNDS RAMPED DOWN HOW

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:28.476
ARE WE GOING TO BE TRACKING

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:31.413
WHAT'S- GOING TO BE OCCURRING

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:34.049
WITH SENIOR FOOD AND SECURITY

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:36.885
WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS- TO THOSE

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:39.387
WHO REMAIN FOOD INSECURE AFTER

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:42.524
THIS- WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT THE

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.826
SENIOR MEALS GAP BEING AT THREE

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:47.062
HUNDRED AND FORTY. MILLION WHAT

OCCURS POST THE CLIFF WHEN THIS

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:54.636
ONE TIME FUNDING RUNS OUT. I'LL

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:56.037
TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THAT AND THEN

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.906
I'LL INVITE MARC BECKLEY TO WHO

01:22:57.972 --> 01:23:00.075
HAS BEEN MORE- TOGETHER THAN I

THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:47.321

OR ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:16.817 --> 01:44:18.619
COULD ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER IT

LOWER DEMAND DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:47:03.383 --> 01:47:05.619
NOT SURPRISINGLY- PEOPLE KIND OF

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:08.054
HUNKERED DOWN. A LOT OF FOLKS

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:09.723

PROGRAM WE DID SEE. QUITE A

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:17.998

THINGS HAVE RE OPENED WE HAVE

01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:24.504

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:25.472
APPLICATIONS AND I KNOW THE

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:27.007
STATE IS PROJECTING ABOUT A TWO

01:47:27.073 --> 01:47:29.409
AND A HALF 23% INCREASE. IN THE

01:47:29.476 --> 01:47:30.977
COMING YEAR THAT'S COMPARED TO

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:33.513
MORE LIKE 526% HISTORICALLY

01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:35.382
WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH OUR-

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:37.717
SORT OF AGING OF OUR POPULATION

01:47:37.784 --> 01:47:39.719
IS AROUND THAT FIVE TO SIX

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:41.988
PERCENT. AS NOTED THAT IS ONLY

01:47:42.055 --> 01:47:44.658
PAID CASES SO THERE MAY BE MORE

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:46.126
INDIVIDUALS COMING ON TO THE

ABOUT THAT TO YOU- WE'RE NOT

01:47:53.233 --> 01:47:55.101
SURE OF COURSE THAT THIS IS MORE

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:57.404
OF A SHORT TERM ISSUE WITH THAT

01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:59.606
PANDEMIC RELATED. IS IT- SORT OF

01:47:59.673 --> 01:48:01.775
BY PRODUCT WHAT MANY OF US ARE

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:04.211
SEEING AND COUNTIES- AT THAT THE

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:05.912
WORK FORCE HAS JUST CHANGED AT

01:48:05.979 --> 01:48:07.814
LEAST TEMPORARILY AND WHO IS

01:48:07.881 --> 01:48:09.115
AVAILABLE TO WORK IN THESE

01:48:09.182 --> 01:48:11.117
POSITIONS OR IS THIS SOMETHING

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:12.385
THAT'S GOING TO BE ONGOING OR

01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:13.720
FOR OTHER REASONS. IT REALLY

01:48:13.787 --> 01:48:15.055
BEARS LOOKING AT THAT TOGETHER

01:48:15.121 --> 01:48:17.157
WE THINK WITH STAKEHOLDERS- THAT

01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:18.725
APARTMENT THE L. A. IT'S

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:20.894
SATURDAY I'M TO TRY TO SEE WHAT

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:23.230
WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THAT THAT

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:24.164
QUESTION. THERE ARE SOME

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:26.366
CHALLENGES- WE ARE ALSO FACING

01:48:26.433 --> 01:48:28.702
WORKFORCE ISSUES LOCALLY-

01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:30.437
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TURNOVER-

01:48:30.503 --> 01:48:32.138
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BURN OUT.

01:48:32.205 --> 01:48:33.874
OF THERE IS DIFFICULTY HIRING

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.375
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING THAT TO

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:39.713
AN COUNTIES JUST AS EVERYONE IS-

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.214
AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE-

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:42.515
THAT WE'VE HAD. AROUND OUTCOMES

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:44.084
AND SORT OF OUR QUALITY WITH

01:48:44.150 --> 01:48:46.853
THE- THE STATE WE KNOW AT SOME

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.121
POINT OBVIOUSLY. THINGS ARE

01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:50.423
GOING TO GET GOING AGAIN BUT NOT

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:51.524
HAVING ENOUGH STAFF IS CERTAINLY

01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:53.126
GOING TO. AFFECT THE OUTCOME

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:54.861
MEASURES WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:56.162
KNOW THE STATE KNOWS THAT AS

01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:57.764
WELL CALLIE'S ARE TRYING I MEAN

01:48:57.831 --> 01:48:59.733
OUR STAFF THAT WE DO HAVE ARE

01:48:59.799 --> 01:49:02.135
TRYING. AS HARD AS THEY CAN. AND

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:03.503
SO FOR THOSE REASONS THE

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.805
FLEXIBILITIES- WE WERE ASKED TO

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:07.774
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT

01:49:07.841 --> 01:49:08.708
WOULD BE HELPFUL. I WOULD SAY

01:49:08.775 --> 01:49:10.043
I'M PRETTY MUCH ANY AND ALL OF

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.912

REALLY LOVE TO SEE CONTINUE.

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:17.350
SPECIFICALLY USE SELF

01:49:17.417 --> 01:49:19.452
ATTESTATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:20.654
DOING ASSESSMENTS OR

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:23.023
REASSESSMENTS- WHATEVER COULD BE

01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:24.758
DONE VIRTUALLY WHETHER THAT IN

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:27.193
PERSON THAT DOES. NOT ONLY KEEP

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.962
PEOPLE SAFE AS WE KNOW COVERT

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:30.931
HAS NOT DISAPPEARED IN THE

01:49:30.997 --> 01:49:32.299
POPULATION WE WORK WITH. IS

01:49:32.365 --> 01:49:33.133
AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:36.102
POPULATION- EVEN STILL THAT ALSO

01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:38.038
SAVES TIME OF COURSE AS WELL FOR

01:49:38.104 --> 01:49:39.940
STAFF THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DO.

01:49:40.006 --> 01:49:41.975
MORE OF THOSE IN A DAY OR A WEEK

01:49:42.042 --> 01:49:43.310
THAN IF THEY WERE TRAVELING. TO

01:49:43.376 --> 01:49:44.911
PEOPLE'S HOMES- OF COURSE THERE

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:46.646
MAY BE TIMES AND BEING IN PERSON

01:49:46.713 --> 01:49:47.948
MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND SO WE

01:49:48.014 --> 01:49:49.716
WOULD WANT TO- THINK THROUGH

01:49:49.783 --> 01:49:51.451

TO SUBMIT FORMS VIRTUALLY OR BY

MAIL OR FAX RATHER THAN HAVING

01:49:57.524 --> 01:49:59.292
TO COME. TO THE OFFICE TO SUBMIT

01:49:59.359 --> 01:50:00.694
THEM IN PERSON TO THE GREATEST

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.729
EXTENT POSSIBLE WE SAW THAT IS

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:04.965
VERY USEFUL AND- DON'T REALLY

01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:06.800

01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:22.882
PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS. THERE

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:23.984
WAS A MEETING JUST YESTERDAY

01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.952
THAT I HAD STAFF AT. AND WE'RE

01:50:26.019 --> 01:50:27.921
WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT

01:50:27.988 --> 01:50:29.689
THE UNIONS WITH CAP OTHER

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS HERE- I

01:50:32.025 --> 01:50:33.326
WILL NOTE THAT SOME QUESTIONS

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:35.128
AROUND ENSURING. SUFFICIENT

01:50:35.195 --> 01:50:36.563
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS FOR THE

01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:38.999
COUNTIES- WERE NOT AWASH IN

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:40.734
FUNDING SO MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.535

STATE OF. ESTIMATING THE COST

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:46.006
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ON OUR END

01:50:46.072 --> 01:50:47.540
WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WELL

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:48.742
THINKING ABOUT THE START DATE WE

01:50:48.808 --> 01:50:50.543
WOULD WANT THIS TO WORK WHILE.

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:53.713
AND CURRENTLY I BELIEVE- THE-

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.282
PROPOSED STATE IS- AT THE END OF

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:58.018
THE FISCAL YEAR THE STARTOF THE

01:50:58.084 --> 01:51:00.286
NEW FISCAL YEAR- WERE SUGGESTING

YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER.

01:51:01.888 --> 01:51:03.256
SCOOTING THAT OUT JUST A FEW

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:05.058
MONTHS PERHAPS EXTENDING WHAT WE

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.926
HAVE NOW WHICH THERE IS A BACK

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:08.595
UP SYSTEM NOW IT'S JUST NOT SORT

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:10.430
OF THE ON GOING- IDEAL SYSTEM.

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:11.898
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT TAKES US

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:14.334
ALL A LITTLE WHILE THE KIND OF

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:15.435
LAND. THE PLANE OF THE LANGUAGE

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:18.638
AND GET EVERYTHING- PUT TOGETHER

01:51:18.705 --> 01:51:19.706
FOR THE ON GOING. THE OTHER

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:21.141
THING WILL I WOULD LIKE TO

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:22.976
MENTION IS JUST- WE ARE

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:25.645
PROPOSING. A NEW ASSESSMENT

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:28.081
PROCESS OF REASSESSMENT PROCESS.

01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:30.617
THAT SORT OF BUILDS ON WHAT'S

01:51:30.683 --> 01:51:32.452
CALLED VARIABLE REASSESSMENTS

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:33.553
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.522
CREATED. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

01:51:35.588 --> 01:51:37.190
AND FOUR BUT IS ONLY AVAILABLE

01:51:37.257 --> 01:51:39.993
FOR A LIMITED- SET OF R. I. H.

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:42.228
SETH RECIPIENTS. THAT DOES NOT

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:44.130
INCLUDE RECIPIENTS WHO ARE

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:46.299
STABLE HAVE VERY LITTLE CHANGE

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:47.934
IN THEIR HEALTH CONDITION AND

01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.035
THERE'S VERY LITTLE CHANGE N

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:50.937
THEIR HOURS FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

01:51:51.004 --> 01:51:54.274
AND SO- WE THINK THAT BEING ABLE

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:55.975
TO DO MORE OF A PAPER BASED

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:58.611

JUSTICE IN AGING THAT WOULD DO

01:52:12.392 --> 01:52:14.427

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:31.951
WE HAVE HAD SOME THAT EXPIRES

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:33.953
THAT'S KIND OF THAT I GUESS THE

02:06:34.019 --> 02:06:36.255

THAT ARE CONTINUING INTO IN IN

02:06:40.192 --> 02:06:41.927
TERMS THAT THEY NEED TO LOOK

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:44.663
FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. AB AS TO

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:47.099
WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE THE NEED FOR

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:48.400
MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE

02:06:48.467 --> 02:06:49.601

MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE OUT TO

02:06:58.844 --> 02:07:00.980

I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

TIMING AND AGAIN. PURSUANT TO

02:08:20.392 --> 02:08:22.194
THE TRAILER BILL THAT WE ARE

02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:24.630
WORKING TO RESOLVE HOW ARE WE

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:27.199
GONNA MEET THIS ENVISIONS JULY

02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:29.868
FIRST DATE WHAT ARE THE

02:08:29.935 --> 02:08:31.370
ADMINISTRATION'S THOUGHTS ON THE

02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:33.005
TIMING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:35.240
ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT NEED TO

02:08:35.307 --> 02:08:37.076
BE ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED IN

02:08:37.142 --> 02:08:38.577
THIS TRAILER BILL AND THE

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:41.914
PRACTICALITIES OF OPERATIONALIZE

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:44.883
IN ALL OF THIS TIMELY DO WE NEED

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:46.085
TO CONSIDER A LEADER

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:47.853
IMPLEMENTATION DATES TO ASSURE

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:50.656
THAT THIS LAUNCHES APPROPRIATELY

02:08:50.722 --> 02:08:52.324
WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:56.762
EXTEND THE CURRENT BACKUP SYSTEM

02:08:56.829 --> 02:09:07.973
IF MORE TIME IS NEEDED.

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.975
AND SO I GUESS I'LL TAKE THAT UP

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:12.444
SO I THINK WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO

02:09:12.511 --> 02:09:14.847
HAVE CONVERSATIONS IT THIS WAS

02:09:14.913 --> 02:09:15.948
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS

02:09:16.014 --> 02:09:17.149
BROUGHT UP DURING OUR

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:18.450
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:20.552
STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH- THE

02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:23.689
COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR- I WOULD.

02:09:23.755 --> 02:09:25.624
PREFER TO MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES

02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:27.359
BECAUSE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:29.428
TO BE SOME UP BUDGET CONCERNS

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:31.196
WITH REGARD TO EXTENDING IT

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:34.766
BEYOND THE CURRENT- DEADLINE- SO

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:38.570
I WOULD. LIKE TO FOR- FOR SURE

02:09:38.637 --> 02:09:42.241
ON THAT. NONCONFORMING OPINIONS

02:09:42.307 --> 02:09:43.609
I THINK OUR INITIAL THOUGHTS IS

02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:44.343
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE

02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:45.878
CONVERSATIONS WERE HAD LOTS

02:09:45.944 --> 02:09:47.913
BUDGET CYCLE THAT WE'D BE ABLE

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:50.616
TO REACH A CONSENSUS ON. WITHIN

02:09:50.682 --> 02:09:52.651
THAT TIME FRAME ON EXTENDING THE

02:09:52.718 --> 02:09:54.686
CURRENT SYSTEM THROUGH THE END

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:56.421
OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WHEN

02:09:56.488 --> 02:09:58.323
ENSURE THAT THERE WASN'T A GAP

02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:00.025
IN THE SERVICES BUT AGAIN.

02:10:00.092 --> 02:10:03.328
HAVING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND

02:10:03.395 --> 02:10:04.596
TAKE THAT BACK. LOOK FORWARD TO

02:10:04.663 --> 02:10:06.131
THAT HEARING THE TESTIMONY AGAIN

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:08.066
TODAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:09.401
US TO HAVE A BACKUP PLAN IF

02:10:09.468 --> 02:10:10.869

02:10:13.505 --> 02:10:15.874
ADMINISTRATION TO. BE WORKING TO

02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:17.910
INSURE THAT WE HAVE ONE OR THE

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:20.045

02:10:26.552 --> 02:10:28.520
ISSUE WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON

02:10:28.587 --> 02:10:30.789
BEFORE BUT I'M REALLY CONCERNED

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:33.592
ABOUT HOW WE ARE ABLE TO AVOID

02:10:33.659 --> 02:10:35.427
INAPPROPRIATE TERMINATIONS FROM

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:38.330

THE FIRST OF JULY OF THIS YEAR.

02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:49.474
OR IF IT'S ANOTHER TIME LATER

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:51.743
WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A STATE IN

02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:54.079
ADVANCE TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:57.683

02:14:34.866 --> 02:14:36.868
PEOPLE FROM. LOSING THEIR

02:14:36.935 --> 02:14:39.538
MEDICAID. HOWEVER IF SOMEBODY

02:14:39.604 --> 02:14:40.906
HAS LOSE THEIR MEDICAL BECAUSE

02:14:40.972 --> 02:14:42.707
THEY DID NOT COMPLETE THEIR

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:45.510
REDETERMINATION BUT ACTUALLY-FALL INTO THE RESIDENTIAL

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:47.846
PROGRAM. AND AT THAT POINT- OUR

02:14:47.913 --> 02:14:50.348
CHILDREN'S SOCIAL WORKER FOR I

02:14:50.415 --> 02:14:52.684
JUST SENSE REALLY. IS A BIG PART

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:54.419
OF WORKING WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:14:54.486 --> 02:14:56.121
AND MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY TO

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:57.823
REESTABLISH THAT PERSON'S

02:14:57.889 --> 02:14:59.691
ELIGIBILITY AND GET MAKE SURE

02:14:59.758 --> 02:15:01.059
THAT THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR

02:15:01.126 --> 02:15:03.562
SERVICES SO THAT IS NOT EXPECTED

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:04.830
TO CHANGE. IS THAT THE

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:07.732
REDETERMINATION ASSISTANCE- THAT

02:15:07.799 --> 02:15:08.834
WAS MENTIONED OR IS THAT THE

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.635
TEMPORARY I. HSS BRIDGE

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:13.805
SERVICES. AND DO EITHER OF THOSE

02:15:13.872 --> 02:15:20.779
PROGRAMS NEED TO BE SUPPORTED AS. WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:21.980
TRANSITION. SO THAT IS THE SO

02:15:22.047 --> 02:15:24.649
THE I US RESIDUAL PROGRAM IS-

02:15:24.716 --> 02:15:25.817
WHAT WAS ALLUDED TO AS THE

02:15:25.884 --> 02:15:27.686
TEMPORARY BRIDGE SERVICES OF

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:30.088
THOSE ALREADY EXIST TODAY- THEY

02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:33.425
ARE STATE ONLY FUNDED. AS MS

02:15:33.492 --> 02:15:36.428
BROOKS HILLS ALLUDED TO AS WELL-

02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:39.130
SO THAT EXISTS TODAY AS WELL AS

02:15:39.197 --> 02:15:40.999
I BELIEVE SHE WAS ALSO SPEAKING

02:15:41.066 --> 02:15:42.067
ON GIVING SOME SUPPORT TO

02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:44.436
COUNTIES. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

02:15:44.503 --> 02:15:47.305
ASSISTANCE WELL FOR SOMEBODY

02:15:47.372 --> 02:15:49.140
LOSES THEIR MEDICAL AND THAT

02:15:49.207 --> 02:15:50.809
WOULD REALLY BE ON THE L. AT THE

02:15:50.876 --> 02:15:53.311
MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY SIDE. NOT SO

02:15:53.378 --> 02:15:56.414

02:15:56.481 --> 02:15:59.518
RECEIVED INFORMATION AFTER ALL

02:15:59.584 --> 02:16:00.852
OF THE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN

02:16:00.919 --> 02:16:02.621
ON THE MEDICAL SIDE SO THIS IS

02:16:02.687 --> 02:16:05.857
REALLY- UP PROCESS THAT'S OWNED

02:16:05.924 --> 02:16:09.895
BY R. T. H. U. R. NURSE. M. AND

02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:11.796
SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE WAY

02:16:11.863 --> 02:16:13.665
IT WORKS FOR US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:16:13.732 --> 02:16:15.333

TALKING A LOT ABOUT WHAT THE H.

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:28.313

02:16:29.481 --> 02:16:31.049
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN TWO

02:16:31.116 --> 02:16:33.351
YEARS WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY STOP

02:16:33.418 --> 02:16:34.853
THE REDETERMINATION PROCESS

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.922
PEOPLE THINK WE DID BUT IN FACT

SEND THEM BACK. THERE WAS

02:16:50.168 --> 02:16:51.703
CONFUSION AROUND THIS IT WAS NOT

02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:54.039
IDEAL BUT IT NEVER STOPPED AND

02:16:54.105 --> 02:16:55.674
SO THERE'S COMMUNICATION THE

02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:58.109

UPDATED SO THAT KIND OF JUST GOT

02:17:11.222 --> 02:17:13.258
ME THINKING HERE- AND- KIND OF

02:17:13.325 --> 02:17:14.926
MADE EYES AT THAT BOB IS WHITE

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:17.262
IN HERE- PERHAPS WE COULD THINK

02:17:17.329 --> 02:17:23.501
ABOUT IN ADDITION. TO COUNTY I

02:17:23.568 --> 02:17:24.936
JUST SAYS ALSO THE THING ABOUT

02:17:25.003 --> 02:17:26.905
TO USE THE- NOW AND- PROVIDERS.

02:17:26.972 --> 02:17:27.739
HOW AN INTEREST IN SERVING

02:17:27.806 --> 02:17:29.174
THEIR- WHICH EITHER FAMILY OF

THEY ARE ABLE TO WORK BECAUSE

02:17:32.143 --> 02:17:33.111
THAT IS THEIR JOB. SO THERE'S

02:17:33.178 --> 02:17:34.846
SORT OF MULTIPLE REASONS WHY YOU

02:17:34.913 --> 02:17:36.648
COULD THINK THAT MAY BE WORKING

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:38.783
WITH THE UNIONS AND KAPPA

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.552
POTENTIALLY STARTED TO YOU INTO

02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:43.455
THE- OF MISTRUST CHILD BUT-

02:17:43.521 --> 02:17:44.689
MAYBE THERE'S SOME THINGS WE

02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:46.257
COULD DO HERE TO DO SOME

02:17:46.324 --> 02:17:47.025
COMMUNICATION WORK. IN THE NEXT

02:17:47.092 --> 02:17:49.327
FEW MONTHS- SINCE WE DON'T A

02:17:49.394 --> 02:17:51.796
100% NO WHEN THE PHD LEFT IS

02:17:51.863 --> 02:17:54.032
GOING TO HAPPEN. THAT THE STATE

02:17:54.099 --> 02:17:56.034
IS SUPPOSED TO GET A SIXTY DAY

02:17:56.101 --> 02:17:56.768
NOTICE SOMEONE THAT'S GOING TO

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:59.104
HAPPEN AT MINIMUM. AND SO WE

02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:01.106
HAVEN'T GOT IT YET SO IT'S AT

02:18:01.172 --> 02:18:02.741
LEAST. TWO MONTHS FROM NOW IT

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.009
COULD BE LONGER I THINK THERE'S

02:18:04.075 --> 02:18:05.844
SOMETHING IT'S GOING TO BE YOU

02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:06.978
KNOW SOMETIME DURING THE SUMMER.

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:08.847
AND THEN I'LL JUST MENTION IF

02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:09.848
IT'S ALL RIGHT THE STATE'S ARE

02:18:09.914 --> 02:18:12.817
BEING GIVEN- BETWEEN TWELVE AND

02:18:12.884 --> 02:18:13.985
FOURTEEN MONTHS TO DO THE

02:18:14.052 --> 02:18:16.921
REDETERMINATION WORK- THE WAY IN

02:18:16.988 --> 02:18:18.223
WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE-

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:21.726
YES IS. THAT WE WILL- BASICALLY

02:18:21.793 --> 02:18:22.994
JUST KEEP PEOPLE ON THEIR

02:18:23.061 --> 02:18:25.563
SCHEDULE SO YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW

02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:27.499
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN JUNE OR JULY

02:18:27.565 --> 02:18:29.167
WE WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

02:18:29.234 --> 02:18:30.168
STARTING THE PROCESS FOR THEM.

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:32.270
AND SO THOSE FOLKS THEY WON'T BE

02:18:32.337 --> 02:18:34.539
DUE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE-

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:37.108
WILL SORT OF WANTS THAT- THAT

02:18:37.175 --> 02:18:39.411
TWELVE MONTH PERIOD KICKS IN-

02:18:39.477 --> 02:18:40.412
IT'LL BE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:42.380
ABOUT. TWO TO THREE MONTHS OUT

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:43.982
WHO WOULD BE WE'D RUN THAT EX

02:18:44.049 --> 02:18:45.917
PARTE PROCESS THEN THEY WILL GET

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:47.252
THE PACK IT WITH PLENTY OF TIME

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:49.788
TO SEND IT BACK IN. AND SO FORTH

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.790
SO- WE HAVE THAT WHOLE TIME- THE

02:18:51.856 --> 02:18:54.392
TWELVE MONTHS IS TO INITIATE AND

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:55.326
THE FOURTEEN MONTH SAYS TO

02:18:55.393 --> 02:18:57.295
COMPLETE THE KNOWING THAT IT'S A

02:18:57.362 --> 02:18:58.863
PROCESS THAT TAKES A LITTLE

02:18:58.930 --> 02:18:59.798
TIME. SO IT'S NOT LIKE

02:18:59.864 --> 02:19:01.666
EVERYTHING HAPPENS ON DAY ONE.

02:19:01.733 --> 02:19:03.768
IT'S ODD IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND

02:19:03.835 --> 02:19:05.336
IDEALLY WILL BE AN ORDERLY

02:19:05.403 --> 02:19:07.872
PROCESS- ONE LAST THING IS JUST

02:19:07.939 --> 02:19:10.241
TO SAY THAT I THINK DH CS IS

02:19:10.308 --> 02:19:11.209

LISTENING SESSION. AND IN IT

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:57.148
THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT

02:20:57.215 --> 02:20:58.883
LANGUAGE ACCESS AND WHETHER

INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE

EXERCISES PEAPOD JET- ONE THING

02:47:26.903 --> 02:47:28.338
THAT WE NOTED IS THAT THE

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES CONTINUE

02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:31.374
TO ASSUME THAT CASELOAD WILL

02:47:31.441 --> 02:47:33.743
CONTINUE TO DECLINE. FROM WE ARE

UNDERSTAND OF POSSIBLE REASONS

INFORMATION ON APPLICATION RATES

02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:46.723
AN EXIT TRENDS. I'M TO SEE IF WE

02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:48.324
CAN FIND ANYTHING THERE- BUT

02:47:48.391 --> 02:47:49.692
WITH REGARDS TO SOMETHING ELSE

02:47:49.759 --> 02:47:51.261
THAT IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE

02:47:51.327 --> 02:47:51.961
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS THE

02:47:52.028 --> 02:47:54.497
DEPARTMENT. NOTED IS THAT THE

02:47:54.564 --> 02:47:56.599
ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO SIGNALED

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:59.135
ITS INTENT TO PROVIDE TWO

02:47:59.202 --> 02:48:00.603
HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION

02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:02.705
DOLLARS. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR

02:48:02.772 --> 02:48:04.240
TO INCREASE S. S. P. GRANT

02:48:04.307 --> 02:48:05.775
LEVELS BY AN ESTIMATED TWENTY

02:48:05.842 --> 02:48:08.545
THREE POINT NINE FIVE PERCENT-

02:48:08.611 --> 02:48:09.579
EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE TWENTY

02:48:09.646 --> 02:48:11.014
TWENTY FOUR- BASED OF OUR

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:12.081
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:48:12.148 --> 02:48:13.883
ADMINISTRATION. AND WE

02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:16.152
UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROVISION OF

02:48:16.219 --> 02:48:19.088
THE TWO NINETY SIX MILLION IN

02:48:19.155 --> 02:48:20.056
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS MEANT TO

02:48:20.123 --> 02:48:22.492
COMPLY WITH INTENT LANGUAGE-

02:48:22.559 --> 02:48:24.127
THAT THE STATE INCREASE S. S. P.

02:48:24.194 --> 02:48:26.696
GRANTS BASED OFF OF THE SAME

02:48:26.763 --> 02:48:28.064
CALCULATION. USED TO DETERMINE

02:48:28.131 --> 02:48:32.469
THE RECENT GRAND INCREASE THAT

02:48:32.535 --> 02:48:33.369
TOOK EFFECT THIS JANUARY. OUR

02:48:33.436 --> 02:48:36.372
CURRENTLY- JUST TWO THINGS THAT

02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:38.541
WE WERE FLAG IS THAT ONE THE

02:48:38.608 --> 02:48:39.876
ADMINISTRATION'S S. S. P. GRANT

02:48:39.943 --> 02:48:42.212
INCREASE REFLECTS ONE OF MANY-

02:48:42.278 --> 02:48:43.746
SP GRANT GOALS THAT THE

02:48:43.813 --> 02:48:44.881
LEGISLATURE COULD CHOOSE TO

02:48:44.948 --> 02:48:47.217
PURSUE FOR EXAMPLE WHILE THE

02:48:47.283 --> 02:48:48.418
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO ASSIST

02:48:48.485 --> 02:48:51.888
P. GRANT INCREASE- IN TWENTY

02:48:51.955 --> 02:48:53.623
TWENTY FOUR WOULD RESULT IN

02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:57.060
GRANTS- FALLING ABOVE JANUARY

02:48:57.126 --> 02:48:58.394
TWO THOUSAND NINE GRANT LEVELS

02:48:58.461 --> 02:49:00.897
PRIOR TO WHEN- WE BEGAN TO DO

02:49:00.964 --> 02:49:03.032
THE GRANT REDUCTIONS DUE TO I'M

02:49:03.099 --> 02:49:04.534
BUDGET CONSTRAINTS- UNDER THE

02:49:04.601 --> 02:49:06.603
GREAT RECESSION BUT ALSO AMONG

02:49:06.669 --> 02:49:08.838
WE- AT AT STOPPED PROVIDING

02:49:08.905 --> 02:49:12.375
ANNUAL COLAS- OTHER- IT WOULD

02:49:12.442 --> 02:49:13.943
NOT BE ENOUGH TO FULLY RESTORE

02:49:14.010 --> 02:49:15.979
PURCHASING POWER LOST OVER THOSE

02:49:16.045 --> 02:49:18.248
YEARS- BUT ALSO IT WOULDN'T BE

02:49:18.314 --> 02:49:19.916
ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT. ALL S. S.

02:49:19.983 --> 02:49:21.918
P. GRANT LEVELS AT LEAST EQUAL A

02:49:21.985 --> 02:49:23.786
100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

02:49:23.853 --> 02:49:25.154
LEVEL ADDITIONALLY WE UNDERSTAND

02:49:25.221 --> 02:49:27.657
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- IS NOT

02:49:27.724 --> 02:49:29.559
PLANNING TO PROVIDE ANY FUNDING

02:49:29.626 --> 02:49:31.794
I'M TO ALIGN WITH OTHER INTENT

02:49:31.861 --> 02:49:33.796
LANGUAGE- THAT IS TO RESTORE

02:49:33.863 --> 02:49:35.098
ANNUAL COST OF LIVING

02:49:35.164 --> 02:49:38.101
ADJUSTMENTS I'M BEGINNING IN

02:49:38.167 --> 02:49:39.903
TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE-

02:49:39.969 --> 02:49:41.404
SO WITH THAT SAID WE SUGGEST

02:49:41.471 --> 02:49:43.072
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SET ITS OWN

02:49:43.139 --> 02:49:45.008
GOALS IN TERMS OF WHERE IT WOULD

02:49:45.074 --> 02:49:47.477
LIKE- ASSESSES PICK GRANT LEVELS

02:49:47.544 --> 02:49:49.145
TO ALTERNATELY BE THINGS THE

02:49:49.212 --> 02:49:50.380
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IN

02:49:50.446 --> 02:49:52.115
FORMULATING THOSE GRANT GOALS

02:49:52.181 --> 02:49:53.316
INCLUDE WHETHER WOULD LIKE TO

02:49:53.383 --> 02:49:55.018
PHASE IN THE GOAL FOR MULTIPLE

02:49:55.084 --> 02:49:57.720
YEARS- WHETHER IT WOULD LIKE TO

02:49:57.787 --> 02:49:59.522
TARGET RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE

02:49:59.589 --> 02:50:00.790
GRANT INCREASES TO SPECIFIC

02:50:00.857 --> 02:50:03.293
GRANT CATEGORIES OR RECIPIENT

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:05.361
GROUPS AND THEN ALSO CONSIDER

02:50:05.428 --> 02:50:06.796
HOW TO MAINTAIN PURCHASING POWER

02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:10.466
OF. GRAND STUDIO FUTURE

02:50:10.533 --> 02:50:11.834
INFLATION. SECOND THING THAT WE

02:50:11.901 --> 02:50:13.503
IN OUR ANALYSIS IS- WHATEVER THE

02:50:13.570 --> 02:50:15.104
GOAL THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY

02:50:15.171 --> 02:50:17.006
LANDS ON WE DO SUGGESTS-

02:50:17.073 --> 02:50:18.875
REVISITING THE EXISTING INTENT

02:50:18.942 --> 02:50:21.744
LANGUAGE. AND ALIGNING- THE

02:50:21.811 --> 02:50:23.046
LANGUAGE WITH THE M. GOAL

02:50:23.112 --> 02:50:24.514
EXPLICITLY ON THIS

02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:26.015
RECOMMENDATION IS EVEN TRUE TO

02:50:26.082 --> 02:50:27.483
THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:30.019
CHOOSES TO PURSUE. A WE BELIEVE

02:50:30.086 --> 02:50:31.955
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANNED S.

02:50:32.021 --> 02:50:33.323
S. P. GRANT INCREASE IN TWENTY

02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:35.358
TWENTY FOUR- THIS IS BECAUSE-

02:50:35.425 --> 02:50:37.527
BASED OFF OF JUST OUR READING OF

02:50:37.594 --> 02:50:38.661
THE LANGUAGE IS. THE LANGUAGE

02:50:38.728 --> 02:50:40.697
DOES NOT SPECIFY THE EXACT

02:50:40.763 --> 02:50:42.832
FUNDING AMOUNT OR GRANT INCREASE

02:50:42.899 --> 02:50:44.367
ALL IT SAYS IS THAT THE GRANT

02:50:44.434 --> 02:50:46.069
INCREASE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE

02:50:46.135 --> 02:50:47.770
SAME CALCULATION. SO WE JUST

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:49.706
THINK GIVEN THAT AND CLEAR UP

02:50:49.772 --> 02:50:51.374
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE EXACT GRAN

02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:53.376
INCREASE IF THE LEGISLATURE DID

02:50:53.443 --> 02:50:56.346
WANT TO. SECURE THE AMOUNT THE

02:50:56.412 --> 02:50:57.914
ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO

02:50:57.981 --> 02:51:00.450
PROVIDE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR-

02:51:00.516 --> 02:51:02.185
IT COULD REVISE THE INTENT

02:51:02.251 --> 02:51:04.387
LANGUAGE TO JUST SPECIFY THAT

02:51:04.454 --> 02:51:06.923
THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX

02:51:06.990 --> 02:51:08.424

WE- CURRENTLY HAVE AN ASK TO

CONTINUE THE FUNDING SURE THAT'S

02:54:03.566 --> 02:54:05.034
NOT SURPRISING SINCE IT IS-

02:54:05.101 --> 02:54:08.805
EXPIRING. IN THE REQUEST IS FOR

02:54:08.871 --> 02:54:10.406
FOUR POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL

ALSO BE ABLE TO MATCH THAT WITH

02:54:14.744 --> 02:54:17.613
FEDERAL FUNDS. AND TO DO THAT IN

02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:18.281
THE EARLY GOING FORWARD- IF WE

02:54:18.347 --> 02:54:19.782
WERE TO LOSE THE TRAINING WHERE

02:54:19.849 --> 02:54:21.818

02:54:21.884 --> 02:54:23.653
MEAN IT I IT SERIOUSLY COULD NOT

02:54:23.719 --> 02:54:25.388
BE A WORST TIME TO LOSE FUNDING.

02:54:25.454 --> 02:54:27.190
IT WOULD DISMANTLE ALL OF THIS

02:54:27.256 --> 02:54:27.990
WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO

02:54:28.057 --> 02:54:28.991
DEVELOPING THIS VERY

02:54:29.058 --> 02:54:29.759
PROFESSIONAL LIVES TRAINING AT A

02:54:29.826 --> 02:54:32.595

IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT MISS

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:40.002
RUTLEDGE WAS TALKING ABOUT ARE

02:54:40.069 --> 02:54:41.504
WE GOING TO DEVELOP IN CASE

02:54:41.571 --> 02:54:43.272
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM HOW DO WE

02:54:43.339 --> 02:54:45.141
STANDARDIZE AND PROFESSIONAL

WISE THIS PROGRAM. THAT'S BEEN

02:54:46.976 --> 02:54:48.945
IN EXISTENCE NOW FOR TWENTY FIVE

02:54:49.011 --> 02:54:50.479
YEARS AND IT'S FINALLY JUST

02:54:50.546 --> 02:54:52.782
GROWING UP TO START TO MEET THE

02:54:52.849 --> 02:54:54.750
DEMAND THAT WE KNOW IS THERE AND

02:54:54.817 --> 02:54:57.920
WILL BE GROWING OVER TIME- WE

02:54:57.987 --> 02:54:59.455
ARE HIRING STAFF FOR INCREASING

02:54:59.522 --> 02:55:00.990
OUR SERVICES AND THIS WOULD

02:55:01.057 --> 02:55:02.959
JUST. KIND OF RIPPED THAT AWAY

02:55:03.025 --> 02:55:04.327
AND MAKE US UNABLE TO PROVIDE

02:55:04.393 --> 02:55:05.962
THE TRAINING NEEDED WE'RE

02:55:06.028 --> 02:55:08.064
HOPEFUL THAT AS WE ARE

02:55:08.130 --> 02:55:09.665
IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW CHANGES

02:55:09.732 --> 02:55:11.467
IN THE PROGRAM WILL ACTUALLY BE

02:55:11.534 --> 02:55:12.902
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A CORE

02:55:12.969 --> 02:55:14.637
TRAINING MODEL. THROUGH THIS

02:55:14.704 --> 02:55:17.406
FUNDING SORT OF LIKE WE DO IN

02:55:17.473 --> 02:55:18.140
CHILD WELFARE WHERE EVERY

02:55:18.207 --> 02:55:21.477
COUNTY- HAS THEIR WORKER BUT

02:55:21.544 --> 02:55:23.112
CHILD WELFARE GO THROUGH THE

02:55:23.179 --> 02:55:24.847
SAME TRAINING AND WE'RE HOPING

02:55:24.914 --> 02:55:27.083
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN A PATH

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:29.919
AS WELL WHICH IS NOT BEEN

02:55:29.986 --> 02:55:31.020
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE

02:55:31.087 --> 02:55:34.190
TO DO THAT. SO AS FAR AS HOW THE

02:55:34.257 --> 02:55:35.191
AB ONE THIRTY FIVE- EXPANSIONS

02:55:35.258 --> 02:55:35.958
ARE GOING- AS YOU KNOW THEY

02:55:36.025 --> 02:55:37.493
HAPPEN ON JANUARY FIRST. THE

02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:39.061
QUITE A FEW THINGS THE TWO THAT

02:55:39.128 --> 02:55:41.230
WE FOCUS THE MOST ON OUR- OF

02:55:41.297 --> 02:55:44.433
THAT SWITCH AN AGE FROM SIXTY

02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:45.968
FIVE TO SIXTY WHICH PUTS THAT IN

02:55:46.035 --> 02:55:47.370
LINE WITH THE OLDER AMERICANS

02:55:47.436 --> 02:55:49.205
ACT PROGRAMS. AND THEN ALSO THE

02:55:49.272 --> 02:55:51.173
ENHANCED CASE MANAGEMENT SO

02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:52.708
THOSE WITH MORE COMPLEX NEEDS

02:55:52.775 --> 02:55:55.411
ARE ABLE TO. STAY IN THE PROGRAM

02:55:55.478 --> 02:55:57.079
WITH AN OPEN CASE LONGER AND

02:55:57.146 --> 02:55:58.881
COUNTIES CAN PROVIDE MORE MORE

02:55:58.948 --> 02:56:00.917
CASE SERVICES. IT'S STILL VERY

02:56:00.983 --> 02:56:02.718
NEW AND SO WE'RE JUST GATHERING

02:56:02.785 --> 02:56:04.820
DATA SO I'M NOT I CAN'T BE QUITE

02:56:04.887 --> 02:56:06.155
AS DEFINITIVE NOW. BUT I KNOW

02:56:06.222 --> 02:56:07.356
THAT WE ARE ALREADY SEEING

02:56:07.423 --> 02:56:08.758
RESULTS WE HAVE ANECDOTAL

02:56:08.824 --> 02:56:11.260
INFORMATION. I DID WANT TO

02:56:11.327 --> 02:56:13.095
SHARE- FROM VENTURA COUNTY. THEY

02:56:13.162 --> 02:56:15.264
RECEIVED A REFERRAL FOR A SIXTY

02:56:15.331 --> 02:56:17.400
YEAR OLD WHOSE SON WAS VERBALLY

02:56:17.466 --> 02:56:19.869
ABUSING HER FINANCIALLY ABUSING

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:21.470
HER. ODD TAKING MONEY WITHOUT

02:56:21.537 --> 02:56:23.606
HER CONSENT LOCKING HER OUT OF

02:56:23.673 --> 02:56:24.941
HER OWN APARTMENT THAT SHE

02:56:25.007 --> 02:56:27.243
SHARED WITH HIM. AND BEFORE THAT

02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:28.878
COUNTY WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO

02:56:28.945 --> 02:56:30.279
REFER THAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:56:30.346 --> 02:56:31.480
BUT APS CANNOT OF STEPPED IN

02:56:31.547 --> 02:56:33.783
BECAUSE OF HER AGE. IN THIS CASE

02:56:33.849 --> 02:56:35.985
THEY COULD STEP IN THEY

02:56:36.052 --> 02:56:37.920
INTERVENE THE SON HAS MOVED OUT.

02:56:37.987 --> 02:56:40.990
NOW THE- THE WOMAN IS HAVING

02:56:41.057 --> 02:56:42.124
DIFFICULTY AFFORDING THE

02:56:42.191 --> 02:56:43.659
APARTMENT BECAUSE HE WAS THERE

02:56:43.726 --> 02:56:45.361
HELPING TO PAY THE RENT. SO YOU

02:56:45.428 --> 02:56:47.263
DO SEE HOW THINGS CAN KIND OF

02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:48.297
SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL FOR

02:56:48.364 --> 02:56:50.933
SOMEONE- THAT COUNTY IS HELPING

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:52.501
BOTH WITH TRAUMA INFORMED

02:56:52.568 --> 02:56:54.036
SERVICES FOR HER. BECAUSE SHE'S

02:56:54.103 --> 02:56:55.805
OBVIOUSLY BEEN THROUGH A LOT BUT

02:56:55.871 --> 02:56:58.007
ALSO WORKING TO BRING HOME SAFE

02:56:58.074 --> 02:56:59.475
THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WE

HELP HER RELOCATE TO MORE

02:57:03.112 --> 02:57:05.114
AFFORDABLE AND SAFE HOUSING. SO

02:57:05.181 --> 02:57:07.049
WE CAN JUST SEE FROM THAT ONE

02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:07.950
EXAMPLE IT CAN REALLY MAKE A

02:57:08.017 --> 02:57:09.518
DIFFERENCE SOME FOR ONE

02:57:09.585 --> 02:57:11.454
INDIVIDUAL PERSON AND OVER TIME

02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:13.589
IT'LL BE MORE AND MORE OF THOSE

02:57:13.656 --> 02:57:15.458
CASES. I WILL MENTION TO YOU

SUPERVISE THEM. THEY'RE OFTEN

02:59:15.277 --> 02:59:19.448

OF ALL KINDS OF EMERGENCIES AND

02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:34.497
DISASTERS- OUR POPULATIONS THAT

02:59:34.563 --> 02:59:36.966
WE SERVE IN APS. AND I JUST

02:59:37.032 --> 02:59:39.001
SASSER AMONG SOME OF THE MOST

02:59:39.068 --> 02:59:40.336
VULNERABLE THEY MAY HAVE DURABLE

02:59:40.402 --> 02:59:41.837
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THAT RELIES ON

02:59:56.619 --> 02:59:58.187
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT COUNTY

02:59:58.254 --> 03:00:00.890

03:00:00.956 --> 03:00:02.224

PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED

03:00:11.066 --> 03:00:12.701
TO BE WRITING. AND THAT CAN LAST

03:00:12.768 --> 03:00:15.771
A REALLY LONG TIME. IN PARADISE

03:00:15.838 --> 03:00:18.040
FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S STILL GOING

03:00:18.107 --> 03:00:20.442

OF THIS GROUND IT'S BEEN COVERED

03:01:51.166 --> 03:01:52.935
A BIT BUT I HOPE THAT I CAN

03:01:53.002 --> 03:01:55.170
PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:01:55.237 --> 03:01:55.871
INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE ISSUES

03:01:55.938 --> 03:01:58.674
THAT ARE CONFRONTING US ASIDE

03:01:58.741 --> 03:02:01.210
RECIPIENTS- I THINK- YOU KNOW.

03:02:01.277 --> 03:02:02.845
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE DECLINES

03:02:02.911 --> 03:02:04.380
THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE SS I

03:02:04.446 --> 03:02:05.981
GRANT AMOUNTS THAT OCCURRED

03:02:06.048 --> 03:02:08.384
SINCE 200-010-2000 ELEVEN BUT

03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:09.718
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ACTUALLY

03:02:09.785 --> 03:02:10.953
THOSE DECLINES REALLY STARTED

03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:12.087
MUCH EARLIER THAN THAT THEY

03:02:12.154 --> 03:02:14.156
REALLY STARTED BACK. IN NINETEEN

03:02:14.223 --> 03:02:15.591
EIGHTY NINE- WIND THE

03:02:15.658 --> 03:02:17.760
LEGISLATURE- BEGAN TO SUSPEND

03:02:17.826 --> 03:02:19.695
THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS

03:02:19.762 --> 03:02:21.263
AND OVER THAT BEGINNING WITH

03:02:21.330 --> 03:02:22.998
THOSE TIMES MANY YEARS EVEN

03:02:23.065 --> 03:02:25.701
PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND TEN NO

03:02:25.768 --> 03:02:26.435
COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR

03:02:26.502 --> 03:02:27.236
BEING PROVIDED NO GRANT

03:02:27.303 --> 03:02:28.771
INCREASES WERE BEING PROVIDED

03:02:28.837 --> 03:02:30.139
FOR THE PROGRAM. AND SO THE

03:02:30.205 --> 03:02:32.308
ATTRITION THE AT THE THAT WAS

03:02:32.374 --> 03:02:33.575
OCCURRING WITH THE PROGRAM

03:02:33.642 --> 03:02:36.111
SIMPLY GOT ACCELERATED IN TWO

03:02:36.178 --> 03:02:37.112
THOUSAND TEN IN TWO THOUSAND

03:02:37.179 --> 03:02:39.214
ELEVEN WE DID THE REALLY DRASTIC

03:02:39.281 --> 03:02:41.150
ACTIONS OF REDUCING THE GRANT BY

03:02:41.216 --> 03:02:42.084
SEVENTY THREE DOLLARS A MONTH

03:02:42.151 --> 03:02:43.752
DOWN TO THE FEDERAL MINIMUM. AND

03:02:43.819 --> 03:02:45.287
THEN PERMANENTLY SUSPENDING THE

03:02:45.354 --> 03:02:47.323
COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT RATHER

03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:48.791
THAN DOING IT ON AN ANNUALIZED

03:02:48.857 --> 03:02:50.626
BASIS IS AS HAD BEEN THE

03:02:50.693 --> 03:02:53.862
UNFORTUNATE PRACTICE PRIOR TO

03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:56.398
THAT- AND SO DO YOU KNOW DUE TO

03:02:56.465 --> 03:02:57.966
THAT WE KNOW THAT THE AT THE

03:02:58.033 --> 03:03:00.569
VALUE OF THE SS I GRANT HAS

03:03:00.636 --> 03:03:01.236
REALLY DECLINED OVER TIME- AND-

03:03:01.303 --> 03:03:02.604
DURING THAT TIME WE'VE ALSO

03:03:02.671 --> 03:03:03.806
SEEN. HOUSING PRICES IN

03:03:03.872 --> 03:03:06.875
CALIFORNIA RIGHTS REMARKABLY-

03:03:06.942 --> 03:03:08.977
AND IN FACT RIGHT NOW THERE'S

03:03:09.044 --> 03:03:10.746
NOT A SINGLE COUNTY IN THE STATE

03:03:10.813 --> 03:03:12.448
OF CALIFORNIA WHERE A STUDIO

03:03:12.514 --> 03:03:15.284
APARTMENT RENTS. ON AVERAGE FOR

03:03:15.351 --> 03:03:16.518
IN THE FOR FAIR MARKET RENT

03:03:16.585 --> 03:03:18.187
WHICH IS 40% OF THE MARKET LEVEL

03:03:18.253 --> 03:03:20.989
BY THE WAY. RENTS BEFORE LAST

03:03:21.056 --> 03:03:23.459
DAM THE- SSI GRANT AMOUNT. NOT A

03:03:23.525 --> 03:03:27.730
SINGLE COUNTY M. IN FACT THE-

03:03:27.796 --> 03:03:29.131
THE AVERAGE PRICE IN CALIFORNIA

03:03:29.198 --> 03:03:30.933
RIGHT NOW FOR SINGLE FOR A

03:03:30.999 --> 03:03:33.535
STUDIO APARTMENT. EXCEEDS

03:03:33.602 --> 03:03:34.103
FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS NOT

03:03:34.169 --> 03:03:36.105
PROBABLY IS A BIT OF AN

03:03:36.171 --> 03:03:37.473
UNDERESTIMATE SINCE. THE DATA

03:03:37.539 --> 03:03:40.909
TENDS TO- IS A LITTLE BIT BEHIND

03:03:40.976 --> 03:03:42.311
THE REALITY THAT OF THE MARKET

03:03:42.378 --> 03:03:43.912
PLACE OUT ON THE STREETS. SO

03:03:43.979 --> 03:03:45.314
THAT THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO

03:03:45.381 --> 03:03:47.116
REALLY COMPOUND ON A ON A-

03:03:47.182 --> 03:03:50.219
REGULAR BASIS AND- WE SEE THE

03:03:50.285 --> 03:03:52.688
RESULT OF THIS- IN HOUSING

03:03:52.755 --> 03:03:54.156
INSTABILITY OF OUR CLIENTS.

03:03:54.223 --> 03:03:56.859
INCREASE HUNGER INCREASED NEEDS

03:03:56.925 --> 03:03:58.927
FOR OTHER KIND OF BENEFITS AND

03:03:58.994 --> 03:04:00.229
SERVICES- PEOPLE HAVING TO GO TO

03:04:00.295 --> 03:04:02.931
FOOD BANKS- ENDS AND JUST NOT

03:04:02.998 --> 03:04:04.466
BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE BASIC

03:04:04.533 --> 03:04:07.536
NECESSITIES OF LIFE- SO THIS

03:04:07.603 --> 03:04:08.937
CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT I

03:04:09.004 --> 03:04:10.305
THINK WE NEED TO. KEEP OUR EYE

03:04:10.372 --> 03:04:12.441
ON AND- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE

03:04:12.508 --> 03:04:14.510
THINK THE GRANT AMOUNTS ARE

03:04:14.576 --> 03:04:16.612
INADEQUATE- WE REALLY APPRECIATE

03:04:16.678 --> 03:04:17.946
THE EFFORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE

03:04:18.013 --> 03:04:19.047
IN THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR TO

03:04:19.114 --> 03:04:21.383
INCREASE FINALLY INCREASE.

03:04:21.450 --> 03:04:21.950
PARTIALLY RESTORE THE GRANT

03:04:22.017 --> 03:04:24.086
INCREASE THAT WAS TAKEN IN TWO

03:04:24.153 --> 03:04:25.721
THOUSAND TEN ELEVEN. WE GOT HALF

03:04:25.788 --> 03:04:28.123
ABOUT ROUGHLY HALF OF THAT BACK-

03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:29.425
AND THAT'S A GREAT START BUT I

03:04:29.491 --> 03:04:31.126
WOULD POINT OUT IN YOUR ANALYSIS

03:04:31.193 --> 03:04:32.327
WHICH I THINK DOES THIS VERY

03:04:32.394 --> 03:04:35.264
WELL. THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF.

03:04:35.330 --> 03:04:38.767
INCREASING THE- THE VALUE OF THE

03:04:38.834 --> 03:04:40.369
GRANT TO ABOUT 92% OF THE

03:04:40.436 --> 03:04:41.870
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL NOW.

03:04:41.937 --> 03:04:43.305
BEFORE ALL THE GRANT INCREASE

03:04:43.372 --> 03:04:44.606
THE COURTS WERE ABOVE A HUNDRED

03:04:44.673 --> 03:04:46.975
PERCENT- BUT- WHAT'S REALLY

03:04:47.042 --> 03:04:48.544
IMPORTANT I THINK IN THE

03:04:48.610 --> 03:04:50.379
ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IS

03:04:50.446 --> 03:04:55.350
NEXT YEAR. WHICH SHOWS THE DROP

03:04:55.417 --> 03:04:57.019
WE'RE DEFERRING THAT SECOND

03:04:57.085 --> 03:05:00.322
PAYMENT. UNTIL TWO TO TWO

03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:01.924
THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR SO WE'RE

03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:03.358
MAKING WE'VE MADE GOOD PROGRESS

03:05:03.425 --> 03:05:05.194
THIS YEAR NOT ENOUGH PROGRESS WE

03:05:05.260 --> 03:05:07.095
MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS. IN TWO

03:05:07.162 --> 03:05:08.230
TWENTY TWENTY TO INCREASING THE

03:05:08.297 --> 03:05:10.165
GRANT UP. BUT NEXT YEAR WE'RE

03:05:10.232 --> 03:05:11.834
GONNA FALL BACK AGAIN. AND WE'RE

03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:13.268
GOING TO BE ROUGHLY BACK TO

03:05:13.335 --> 03:05:15.037
WHERE WE WERE PRIOR TO THE IN

03:05:15.103 --> 03:05:16.238
THE INCREASE IN THE GRANT

03:05:16.305 --> 03:05:18.073
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. INFLATION IS

03:05:18.140 --> 03:05:20.976
VERY HIGH RIGHT NOW. SO THAT

03:05:21.043 --> 03:05:22.945
THAT THAT IS WHY I THINK YOU

03:05:23.011 --> 03:05:24.413
CAN- WESTERN CENTER AND

03:05:24.480 --> 03:05:26.114
CALIFORNIA'S REST ASIDE OR

03:05:26.181 --> 03:05:28.851
ASKING TO ACCELERATE THE TWO

03:05:28.917 --> 03:05:29.952
THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOUR.

03:05:30.018 --> 03:05:32.988
INCREASED INTO THE TWO THOUSAND

03:05:33.055 --> 03:05:34.690
TWENTY THREE TWENTY A TWENTY TWO

03:05:34.756 --> 03:05:36.191
TWENTY THREE BUDGET. SO THAT WE

03:05:36.258 --> 03:05:37.960
DON'T FALL BACK SO THAT THE

03:05:38.026 --> 03:05:39.394
GRANT THE F. P. O. AMOUNT DOES

03:05:39.461 --> 03:05:41.530
NOT DECLINE BACK CLOSE TO THE

03:05:41.597 --> 03:05:43.799
LEVEL WHERE WE ARE AT. IF WE

03:05:43.866 --> 03:05:45.868
WERE TO INCREASE- IF WE WERE TO

03:05:45.934 --> 03:05:48.370
PROVIDE THE SECOND PAYMENT IN IN

03:05:48.437 --> 03:05:50.072
THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE

03:05:50.138 --> 03:05:51.139
BUDGET. WE'D ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO

03:05:51.206 --> 03:05:53.208
PUMP UP THE PERCENT OF THE

03:05:53.275 --> 03:05:54.810
APPEAL TO ABOUT NINETY THREE

03:05:54.877 --> 03:05:57.079
POINT TWO PERCENT. SO I REALLY

03:05:57.145 --> 03:05:58.080
THINK THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT'S

03:05:58.146 --> 03:06:00.115
IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE DO

03:06:00.182 --> 03:06:01.583
WE CONTINUE TO TAKE A STEP

03:06:01.650 --> 03:06:03.185
FORWARD OR ARE READ THIS YOU'RE

03:06:03.252 --> 03:06:04.419
GOING TO TAKE FRANKLY A STEP

03:06:04.486 --> 03:06:06.488
BACK. AND THEN IS YOUR ANALYSIS

03:06:06.555 --> 03:06:08.857
POINTS OUT IN TWO YEARS. WE'LL

03:06:08.924 --> 03:06:10.292
PUT THAT THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS

03:06:10.359 --> 03:06:12.361
BACK AND WILL BE BACK EXACTLY

03:06:12.427 --> 03:06:13.996
WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND SO I

03:06:14.062 --> 03:06:15.330
THINK THE LEGISLATURE REALLY

03:06:15.397 --> 03:06:17.299
NEEDS TO I THINK BE MORE

03:06:17.366 --> 03:06:18.734
PROACTIVE IN THIS. AND TO REALLY

03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:21.270
INCREASE GRANTS- ON A REGULAR

03:06:21.336 --> 03:06:23.438
CONSECUTIVE BASIS SO WE CAN GET

03:06:23.505 --> 03:06:25.874
THE GRANT LEVELS BACK UP ABOVE A

03:06:25.941 --> 03:06:26.875
100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

03:06:26.942 --> 03:06:32.080
LEVEL AT MINIMUM- SO. YEAH I

03:06:32.147 --> 03:06:34.082
THINK- THIS IS SOMETHING I

03:06:34.149 --> 03:06:35.851
REALLY DO THINK THAT THE

03:06:35.918 --> 03:06:36.818
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO TAKE

03:06:36.885 --> 03:06:39.187
SERIOUSLY. AND CONSIDER- SO THAT

03:06:39.254 --> 03:06:40.289
WOULD CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING

03:06:40.355 --> 03:06:41.890
THAT WE'D BE LOOKING TO GET-

03:06:41.957 --> 03:06:44.293
DONE- THIS YEAR AND ON THIS

03:06:44.359 --> 03:06:45.294
ISSUE THE COST OF LIVING

03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:46.862
ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS RAISED BY

03:06:46.929 --> 03:06:49.798
VOEPEL AGO- WE ABSOLUTELY THINK

03:06:49.865 --> 03:06:51.633
THAT THE- THE- COAL AS IT'S

03:06:51.700 --> 03:06:53.101
CALLED. OUGHT TO BE MADE

03:06:53.168 --> 03:06:54.836
PERMANENT THAT WE OUGHT TO GO

03:06:54.903 --> 03:06:56.138
BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE THE COST

03:06:56.204 --> 03:06:57.906
OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IS IN THE

03:06:57.973 --> 03:06:58.941
STATUTE IT'S EXPECTED. WE WANT

03:06:59.007 --> 03:07:00.776
TO MAINTAIN THE GRANT LEVELS NOT

03:07:00.842 --> 03:07:02.711
HAVE THEM DECLINE EVERY YEAR.

03:07:02.778 --> 03:07:05.681
AND THE- THE LEGISLATURE THEN

03:07:05.747 --> 03:07:06.982
WOULD HAVE THE PREROGATIVE AND

03:07:07.049 --> 03:07:08.050
NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNOR ON A

03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:10.085
REGULAR BASIS TO BE ABLE TO

03:07:10.152 --> 03:07:11.053
DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO PROVIDE

03:07:11.119 --> 03:07:12.220
THAT COAL OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD

03:07:12.287 --> 03:07:13.355
BE SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR

03:07:13.422 --> 03:07:15.190
COMPOSED THEIR BUDGET. BUT THE

03:07:15.257 --> 03:07:17.259
LACK OF THAT I THINK PUTS OF THE

03:07:17.326 --> 03:07:19.227
LEGISLATURE IN. A WEAKER

03:07:19.294 --> 03:07:20.929
POSITION AND I THINK WE WANT TO

03:07:20.996 --> 03:07:22.798
PUT THE LEGISLATURE IN A

03:07:22.864 --> 03:07:23.632
STRONGER POSITION GOING FORWARD

03:07:23.699 --> 03:07:24.967
TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THIS

03:07:25.033 --> 03:07:26.969
DEBATE ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND

03:07:27.035 --> 03:07:28.370
THAT THAT MONEY IS ASSUME THAT

03:07:28.437 --> 03:07:29.938
IT'S GOING TO BE PROVIDED THE

03:07:30.005 --> 03:07:31.106
LEGISLATURE AND TE GOVERNOR.

03:07:31.173 --> 03:07:32.574
AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE BILL

03:07:32.641 --> 03:07:35.177
THAT INCREASED INTO THE- INTO

03:07:35.243 --> 03:07:37.145
THE BUDGET ON A REGULAR BASIS.

03:07:37.212 --> 03:07:38.947
I'M AND LASTLY I'VE BEEN ASKED

03:07:39.014 --> 03:07:41.183
TO ADDRESS. AN ISSUE THAT I

03:07:41.249 --> 03:07:42.084
THINK WE'VE SEEN WE'VE HEARD

03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:44.186
DISCUSSED BY. BY RECIPIENTS WHEN

03:07:44.252 --> 03:07:45.554
THEY TESTIFIED IT VARIES HEARING

03:07:45.621 --> 03:07:48.357
YOU MAY HEAR A BIT OF MORE OF IT

03:07:48.423 --> 03:07:50.425
TODAY WHEN THEY COME ON IN A FEW

03:07:50.492 --> 03:07:51.660
MINUTES. AND THAT IS THAT- WE

03:07:51.727 --> 03:07:52.861
HEAR STORIES OF THAT NGUYEN WE

03:07:52.928 --> 03:07:55.464
PROVIDE GRANT INCREASES TO- THE

03:07:55.530 --> 03:07:57.399
RECIPIENTS. THAT THEY OFTEN

03:07:57.466 --> 03:07:59.368
DON'T SEE MUCH OF THAT ACTUALLY

03:07:59.434 --> 03:08:01.937
IN THEIR CHECK. AND THERE AND-

03:08:02.004 --> 03:08:03.705
AND THERE ARE. AND THERE'S A

03:08:03.772 --> 03:08:04.940
REASON FOR THAT AND THAT IS THAT

03:08:05.007 --> 03:08:06.908
MANY. MANY RECIPIENTS ARE GOOD

03:08:06.975 --> 03:08:08.010
NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS LIVING

03:08:08.076 --> 03:08:10.112
HOUSING WHERE. THE COST OF THEIR

03:08:10.178 --> 03:08:11.346
HOUSING IS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR

03:08:11.413 --> 03:08:13.882
INCOME SO AS WE DO THE RIGHT

03:08:13.949 --> 03:08:15.817
THING INCREASE PEOPLE'S. GRANT

03:08:15.884 --> 03:08:18.020
AMOUNTS- A HOUSING PROVIDER

03:08:18.086 --> 03:08:19.588
MAYBE TAKE AN INCREASING

03:08:19.655 --> 03:08:20.555
PERCENTAGE TAKING THAT SAME

03:08:20.622 --> 03:08:23.592
PERCENTAGE. SO WE ALL FEEL GOOD

03:08:23.659 --> 03:08:25.293
AND WE SHOULD ABOUT WHAT WE DO

03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:26.795
IN TERMS OF INCREASING GRANTS.

03:08:26.862 --> 03:08:29.097
BUT AT THE FOR THE RECIPIENT IT

03:08:29.164 --> 03:08:32.734
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A HUGE

03:08:32.801 --> 03:08:34.202
IMPACT ON THEIR LIFE- AND SO-

03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:35.337
YEAH IT'S GREAT THAT THEY SAY

03:08:35.404 --> 03:08:37.773
HOUSE- BUT IT'S NOT REALLY

03:08:37.839 --> 03:08:39.307
GETTING TO WHERE THEY- GETTING

03:08:39.374 --> 03:08:41.209
MORE DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKET. TO

03:08:41.276 --> 03:08:42.144
ALLOW THEM TO MEET THE

03:08:42.210 --> 03:08:44.146
ESCALATING COSTS THAT WERE THERE

03:08:44.212 --> 03:08:45.247
EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW.

03:08:45.313 --> 03:08:47.683
SIMILARLY WHEN WE SEE A GRAND

03:08:47.749 --> 03:08:49.217
INCREASED WHAT A GRAND INCREASE

03:08:49.284 --> 03:08:51.153
COMES THROUGH. IT ALSO HAS THE

03:08:51.219 --> 03:08:52.621
EFFECT OF SLIGHTLY REDUCING

03:08:52.688 --> 03:08:55.390
CALFRESH AMOUNTS. AND YOU MISTER

03:08:55.457 --> 03:08:58.326
CHAIR YOU WORK. VERY HARD A FEW

03:08:58.393 --> 03:08:59.294
YEARS AGO. AND THE COUNTIES

03:08:59.361 --> 03:09:00.729
WORKED REALLY HARD AND CDSS

03:09:00.796 --> 03:09:02.030
WORKED REALLY HARD. AND WHAT

03:09:02.097 --> 03:09:03.498
WE'VE DONE A REMARKABLE JOB

03:09:03.565 --> 03:09:05.133
GETTING ASSISTS. CALFRESH

03:09:05.200 --> 03:09:06.702
TESTIFY RECIPROCAL THINK WERE IN

03:09:06.768 --> 03:09:08.870
THE NEIGHBORHOOD SIX HUNDRED

03:09:08.937 --> 03:09:09.671
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RECIPIENTS

03:09:09.738 --> 03:09:11.540
NOW- WHICH IS. REALLY A

03:09:11.606 --> 03:09:13.709
REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND

03:09:13.775 --> 03:09:15.644
ONE THAT WE DON'T TAKE ENOUGH

03:09:15.711 --> 03:09:17.179
CREDIT FOR. BUT WHEN WE INCREASE

03:09:17.245 --> 03:09:20.015
THE SFI- AMOUNT IN JANUARY WE

03:09:20.082 --> 03:09:20.916
HEARD VERY QUICKLY FROM

03:09:20.982 --> 03:09:22.284
RECIPIENTS THAT WHEN THEY WERE

03:09:22.350 --> 03:09:24.386
COMING IN FOR THE RENEWALS. FOR

03:09:24.453 --> 03:09:26.388
A RECERTIFICATION FOR CALPERS.

03:09:26.455 --> 03:09:27.756
THEY WERE GETTING YOU KNOW A TEN

03:09:27.823 --> 03:09:29.324
DOLLAR MONTH CUT A FIFTEEN

03:09:29.391 --> 03:09:30.892
DOLLAR A MONTH CUT. IN THEIR

03:09:30.959 --> 03:09:32.194
CALFRESH AMOUNTS BECAUSE WE GAVE

03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:34.362
PEOPLE MORE INCOME. NOT THAT'S

03:09:34.429 --> 03:09:35.931
JUST THE LAW COUNTIES AREN'T

03:09:35.997 --> 03:09:37.299
DOING ANYTHING WRONG HERE THIS

03:09:37.365 --> 03:09:39.234
IS JUST THE WAY THE SYSTEM

03:09:39.301 --> 03:09:40.969
WORKS- BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS

03:09:41.036 --> 03:09:42.237
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO I THINK

03:09:42.304 --> 03:09:44.339
THAT. WOULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE OR

03:09:44.406 --> 03:09:45.807
SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S

03:09:45.874 --> 03:09:48.110
CONSIDERATION. WHICH IS LAST

03:09:48.176 --> 03:09:49.778
YEAR WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE

03:09:49.845 --> 03:09:52.814
GOLDEN STATE GRANT. TO TO SSI

03:09:52.881 --> 03:09:54.750
COWART'S RECIPIENTS AND I JUST

03:09:54.816 --> 03:09:56.485
WANT TO SAY PARENTHETICALLY.

03:09:56.551 --> 03:09:57.586
THAT THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL

03:09:57.652 --> 03:10:00.489
SERVICES DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB.

03:10:00.555 --> 03:10:01.757
M. COUNTIES IN GETTING OUT THE

03:10:01.823 --> 03:10:03.658
COWART'S GRANTS AMBIANCES SITE

03:10:03.725 --> 03:10:05.927
GRANTS. VERY EFFECTIVELY VERY

03:10:05.994 --> 03:10:07.963
QUICKLY WITH ALMOST NO PROBLEMS.

03:10:08.029 --> 03:10:10.398
SO YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. AND

03:10:10.465 --> 03:10:12.534
THE BEAUTY OF PROVIDING THE ONE

03:10:12.601 --> 03:10:14.469
TIME PAYMENTS. LIKE THE GOLDEN

03:10:14.536 --> 03:10:17.439
STATE GRANT LAST YEAR. WAS THAT.

03:10:17.506 --> 03:10:19.708
BECAUSE IT'S A ONE TIME PAYMENT.

03:10:19.775 --> 03:10:20.976
IT'S NOT TAKEN INTO

03:10:21.042 --> 03:10:22.644
CONSIDERATION BY HOUSING

03:10:22.711 --> 03:10:24.012
PROVIDER BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN

03:10:24.079 --> 03:10:25.947
INCREASE IN THE GRANT. IT'S JUST

03:10:26.014 --> 03:10:27.282
A ONE TIME PAYMENT THE GOES INTO

03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:28.850
PEOPLE'S ACCOUNTS. SO DOESN'T

03:10:28.917 --> 03:10:33.388
REDUCE PEOPLE OR. DOESN'T

03:10:33.455 --> 03:10:34.022
INCREASE PEOPLE'S RENT. ALL IT

03:10:34.089 --> 03:10:35.757
DOESN'T GET INTO ACCOUNT. FOR

03:10:35.824 --> 03:10:38.860
COVERAGE PURPOSES. SO THE GRANT

03:10:38.927 --> 03:10:41.096
FOR CALFRESH STAYS THE SAME. SO

03:10:41.163 --> 03:10:42.864
THERE'S A REAL ADVANTAGE I THINK

03:10:42.931 --> 03:10:44.266
IN SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE

03:10:44.332 --> 03:10:45.967
TO CONSIDER WE LOVE THE GETTING

03:10:46.034 --> 03:10:47.402
WE REALLY INSIST ON GETTING

03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:49.004
HIGHER GRANT AMOUNTS WE THINK

03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:50.338
THAT IS THE COURSE. OVER THE

03:10:50.405 --> 03:10:52.007
LONG HAUL TO GET THERE BUT WE

03:10:52.073 --> 03:10:54.509
THINK IN A TIME OF SURPLUS WHERE

03:10:54.576 --> 03:10:56.378
WE HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA MONEY

03:10:56.444 --> 03:10:57.779
WERE IN A PANDEMIC WE ARE GOING

03:10:57.846 --> 03:10:59.314
TO HAVE TO SPEND MONEY. THAT

03:10:59.381 --> 03:11:00.916
THOSE DOLLARS GETTING IN THE

03:11:00.982 --> 03:11:02.250
HANDS OF COMMERCE INNOCENCE I

03:11:02.317 --> 03:11:04.820
RECIPIENTS IS A VERY VERY WISE

03:11:04.886 --> 03:11:06.855
POLICY CHOICES. AND WE WOULD

03:11:06.922 --> 03:11:08.723
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO.

03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:12.127
CONSIDER ADDING THAT INTO THE

03:11:12.194 --> 03:11:14.095
BUDGET IS WE GET TO THE MAY

03:11:14.162 --> 03:11:15.430
REVISE. SO WITH THAT OLD

03:11:15.497 --> 03:11:17.599
CONCLUDE MY CAUGHT MY COMMENTS

03:11:17.666 --> 03:11:19.901
THANK. WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT

03:11:19.968 --> 03:11:22.070
UP TO THE DÍAS FOR QUESTIONS AND

03:11:22.137 --> 03:11:24.206
KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR. I'D

03:11:24.272 --> 03:11:26.141
LIKE TO STICK WITH THE SS I SS

03:11:26.208 --> 03:11:28.643
P. GRANT LEVELS FOR THE FIRST

03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:30.979
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE-

03:11:31.046 --> 03:11:32.180
I'M GOING TO ASK BOTH THE

03:11:32.247 --> 03:11:33.648
DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND

03:11:33.715 --> 03:11:36.151
THE L. A. L. TO SEE IF THERE'S A

03:11:36.218 --> 03:11:38.553
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SSI. S.

03:11:38.620 --> 03:11:41.590
S. P. GRANT LEVELS AND THE ENTRY

03:11:41.656 --> 03:11:44.826

03:11:44.893 --> 03:11:47.362
HOPING YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE

03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:50.398
CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO.

03:11:50.465 --> 03:11:51.166
JACQUI RESTED WITH THE

03:11:51.233 --> 03:11:52.734
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE WERE

03:11:52.801 --> 03:11:55.604
HAPPY TO WORK WITH DSS- TO DIG

03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:57.072
DEEPER ON THIS QUESTION BUT JUST

03:11:57.138 --> 03:11:59.241
AN INITIAL POT- IN RESPONSE TO

03:11:59.307 --> 03:12:01.409
YOUR QUESTION IS. THE GRANT

03:12:01.476 --> 03:12:04.279
LEVELS THEMSELVES SERVE AS THE

03:12:04.346 --> 03:12:07.182
INCOME THRESHOLD- AT MY CAN

03:12:07.249 --> 03:12:09.451
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. I'M SO

03:12:09.517 --> 03:12:11.820
IMPLICIT SO DIRECTLY THAT IN AND

03:12:11.887 --> 03:12:13.822
OF ITSELF IS AN ELIGIBILITY ROLE

03:12:13.889 --> 03:12:15.190
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT GRANT

03:12:15.257 --> 03:12:17.559
LEVELS ARE KEEPING UP WITH

03:12:17.626 --> 03:12:21.196
INFLATION. IN A WAY- WE'RE JUST-

03:12:21.263 --> 03:12:23.598
ELIGIBILITY IS THAN JUST FURTHER

03:12:23.665 --> 03:12:25.333
ERODING OVER TIME AND IT'SJUST

03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:28.670
BEING REDUCED TO THE MOST POOR-

03:12:28.737 --> 03:12:30.572
AND- PER PERSONS WITH

03:12:30.639 --> 03:12:33.174
DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS-

03:12:33.241 --> 03:12:36.044
SAID THAT'S A DYNAMIC- WITH HOW

03:12:36.111 --> 03:12:37.679
THE GRANT LEVEL SPECIFICALLY

03:12:37.746 --> 03:12:39.915
TRANS. HOW DO THEY TRANSLATE

03:12:39.981 --> 03:12:41.283
INTO THE ELIGIBILITY SIDE OF

03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:42.350
THINGS. I GUESS FOR THE

03:12:42.417 --> 03:12:43.885
DEPARTMENT AND FOLLOWING UP WITH

03:12:43.952 --> 03:12:45.620
THE CASELOAD TREND ANALYSIS

03:12:45.687 --> 03:12:47.923
THAT'S ON THE TOP OF PAGE TWENTY

03:12:47.989 --> 03:12:52.560
FOUR. DO WE FEEL THAT THIS- IS

03:12:52.627 --> 03:12:55.297
FURTHER A ROADING ELIGIBILITY.

03:12:55.363 --> 03:12:57.032
IS THIS WHY WE'RE HAVING THE

03:12:57.098 --> 03:12:59.935
LOWER CASELOAD. TREND THAT WE'VE

03:13:00.001 --> 03:13:05.640

THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR THE-

03:13:08.443 --> 03:13:09.778
CONNECTION POINT YEAH WE DO

03:13:09.844 --> 03:13:11.613
THINK THAT THAT IS ONE THING

03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:13.381
THAT MIGHT BE DRIVING KEITHSBURG

03:13:13.448 --> 03:13:16.518
REDUCTION IS THE FACT THAT THE

03:13:16.584 --> 03:13:18.253
DESTRUCTIVE SAID- THE INCOME

03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:19.521
ELIGIBILITY LIMIT IS THE

03:13:19.587 --> 03:13:21.222
MAXIMUM. BUT THERE ARE SOME

03:13:21.289 --> 03:13:22.724
DISREGARD BUT IT'S BASICALLY THE

03:13:22.791 --> 03:13:25.427
MAXIMUM GRANT AMOUNT EQUALS THE

03:13:25.493 --> 03:13:27.595
ELIGIBILITY FOR INCOME. HOWEVER

03:13:27.662 --> 03:13:28.463
THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE

03:13:28.530 --> 03:13:31.099
THINK- HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE

03:13:31.166 --> 03:13:32.968
DECLINE IN CASE WE DO THINK THAT

03:13:33.034 --> 03:13:34.502
THE CLOSURE OF THE ATHLETIC

03:13:34.569 --> 03:13:37.105
FIELD OFFICES FOR IT NOW AT THIS

03:13:37.172 --> 03:13:39.207
POINT. LITTLE VER TWO YEARS-

03:13:39.274 --> 03:13:40.875
MAY BE CONTRIBUTING AND MAY MAKE

03:13:40.942 --> 03:13:42.377
IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE

03:13:42.444 --> 03:13:43.878
TO GET ON TO TESTIFY AT THE

03:13:43.945 --> 03:13:46.448
PEAK- WE DO THINK THAT THERE

03:13:46.514 --> 03:13:49.718
ARE- ALSO SOME POSITIVE REASONS

03:13:49.784 --> 03:13:50.919
THAT THE KIDS BOOK ARTICLE

03:13:50.986 --> 03:13:52.887

DISABILITIES. AND ADVANCES IN

03:14:03.732 --> 03:14:05.300
TECHNOLOGY THAT MIGHT BE MAKING

03:14:05.367 --> 03:14:07.535
