GO AHEAD THE MANAGER WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PRINT ON EIGHTY ONE THIRTY SIX FIRST OF ALL I'M SORRY ARE YOU WHEN MY EYES JUMPED ONE OF THEM NOW OKAY YOU'RE RIGHT WE SHOWED YOU WANT THIRTY SIX FIRST WHICH IS THE TRAILER BILL ON DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THAT'S RIGHT OKAY EIGHTY ONE THIRTY SIX- DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THIS BILL INCLUDES EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FINDS BEGIN THE BASIN OF INCREASED RATES WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES- IT ALSO GIVES DIRECTOR DISCRETION TO RE AUTHORIZE. PLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHLY SPECIALIZED NEEDS AN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES. IS LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS.

INCLUDING FOR TRANSLATIONS OF ORIENTATIONS AND TRAININGS TO MEET LANGUAGE NEEDS OFTHE COMMUNITY AND THOSE ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS ON. EIGHTY ONE THIRTY SIX HAPPY TO RESPOND TO A REQUEST. THANK YOU I ACTUALLY DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- FIRST I WANTED TO INDICATE THAT I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE. THE IN THIS BILL THE ITEM AROUND THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR OUR REGIONAL CENTERS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A CALIFORNIA BEING THE DIVERSE STATE WE ARE. WE HAVE FOLKS WHO NEED THOSE SERVICES WHO DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ENGLISH AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE. OR ALSO HAVE- MAY APPROACH JUST DID. THE CULTURAL ORIENTATIONS VERY DIFFERENT ADDITIONALLY SO I WOULD PRESUMABLY TO SEE THAT. THE OTHER THING THAT I AM- WELL COMMON AT LATER BUT ON THE- I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE DURING THE RECESSION WHEN WE CUT. THE RATES TO PROVIDERS OF THESE SERVICES UP FOR ARE TOO BAD RGD SERVICES AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF RESTORING KNOWS AND WHAT I'D LIKE IF YOU DON'T MIND WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER IS WHAT- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN THE FIRST YEAR- IN OTHER WORDS I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE PHASED IN OVER TIME BUT IS THERE A CERTAIN PERCENT THAT WILL BE INCREASED IN THIS FIRST YEAR. I'M SURE I'LL I'LL START WITH THAT QUESTION AND THEN A LOT OF IT OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES DETAILS BUT THE INITIAL FIRST YEAR IS EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION AND IT DOES GROW. TO ONE POINT TWO MILLION- IN THE FIFTH YEAR THOSE ARE THAT'S THE RANGE BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR MORE DETAILS. THANK YOU. HI CHRIS O'NEILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- I'M SURE. ON SO THE WAY THAT THAT THE- THE RIGHT IMPLEMENTATION IS STRUCTURED- RATES WOULD INCREASE BY 25% OF WHAT THE RACY MODELS HAVE SAID THAT CERTAIN SERVICE CODES- SHOULD SHOULD BE ADVANCING TWENTY NINETEEN NUMBER SO THERE WOULD BE AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE. BY 25% BEGINNING APRIL FIRST ON THE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION- INTO BUDGET YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE TO ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES- ON APPROVAL OF THAT PLAN AND ALSO THE OPERATIONALIZED INCREASES TO REGIONAL CENTRES. CONTINUING TO BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE TO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WOULD BE THAT THEN FOR THE FOLLOWING- FISCAL YEARS AND BE A 50% INCREASE IN YOUR 525-220-2520 TWENTY SIX- WOULD BE FULL FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND- AT THAT POINT IT WOULD BE 90% BASE PAY FOR- FOR PROVIDERS BASED ON THE RATE MODELS AND TEN PERCENT. UP QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM DIED- IS GOING TO BE DEVELOPED DURING THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE INTERVENING YEARS FOR THAT QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM THERE ALSO BE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO- TO FIND A QUALITY INCENTIVES. THANK YOU AND- I HOPE THAT WE CAN HI. THIS IS- IS THAT WE CAN GET TO THE POINT WHERE I HOPE THAT OUR REVENUES ARE SUCH THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE- THE FULL RATE SIDE UNDER IDENTIFIED UNDER THE RATE STUDY PRIOR TO THE- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEAR- BUT OF COURSE WE'LL SEE THAT OVER TIME BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS PROGRESS BEING MADE.

THE COMMITTEE HOUSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET ME SEE YES SENATOR CAFIERO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- LET ME JUST SAY THAT I REALLY AM- TORN BY THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND- AND I AND I JUST FEEL COMPELLED TO MAKE A COMMENT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE PROVISIONAL THE EXTENSION OF THE PROVISIONAL LICENSES. NOW FOR CANNABIS- FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME- THEY EXPIRE THIS YEAR AND SO IT'S URGENT THAT WE DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA THAT WE DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO HAVE MOVED INTO THE REGULATED MARKET THEY ARE BUSINESSES AND WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL GIVEN THAT. THEY ARE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH A- A VERY NECESSARY BUT TIME CONSUMING CYCLIC PROCESS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE WERE NOT PREPARED. TO UNDERTAKE ON THEIR BEHALF THEY'RE THE PROPONENTS OF THE- OF THE PROJECTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISN'T SO WHILE I SUPPORT TO THE- THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW- CANNABIS. ENTITY AND PUT N. THE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL THE SERVICES INTO ONE I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD MOVE THAT THE TREATMENT OF THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE LICENSES HAS ME GRAVELY CONCERNED BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT IT'S GOING TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT I AM HEARING FROM. THE CANNABIS PRODUCERS AND- WELL THAT CANNABIS LICENSEES THAT HAVE PROVISIONAL LICENSE 80% OF THE LICENSES ARE PROVISION ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M HEARING FROM THEM AND I'M HEARING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT THERE'S SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES. WITH THE WITH THE BILL AS IT'S- AS IT'S PROPOSED I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY- FOR THOSE REASONS AND I'M I'M HOPING THAT THERE'S A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE TO THAT. PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET THOSE SYKORA. ANALYSIS COMPLETED ON TIME IN THAT WE DON'T. DETRIMENTALLY PREJUDICED THE- CURRENT PROVISIONAL LICENSEES WHO ARE REALLY ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE LEGAL MARKET AND TO STAY IN THE LEGAL MARKET. I'M EITHER DEPARTMENT FINANCE OR- MISS- HARBISON DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENT. YES THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER AND THANK YOU SENATOR COPIER FOR YOUR COMMENTS KIMBERLY HARBISON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP ON CANNABIS- GENERALLY AND ESPECIALLY WITH PROVISIONAL LICENSING. I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDING. IN THE BUDGET TO HELP THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MEET THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE TIMELINE- THIS LANGUAGE ISN'T PERFECT BUT IT REPRESENTS AN AGREEMENT THAT WORKS AS WELL AS WE COULD GET IT TO THIS POINT WE'RE OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS AT THE LEGISLATURE. TO CONTINUE REFINING IT BUT- JUST ANOTHER PLUG FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO BE ESTABLISHED TOMORROW THANK YOU. LET E SEE IF THERE'S US SENATOR MCGUIRE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR IN IN MEMBERS- GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL AND FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANNA SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS FOR ALL OF HER WORK ON THE ISSUE OF CANNABIS AND KNOW THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF WORK. TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST THOSE WHO ARE WORKING WITHIN HER REGION I'M NOT A CHAIR WHEN PROP TWO SIXTEEN PASS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT JUST BE CANDID WITH EACH OTHER THERE IS SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THAT CLEANING UP SOME OF THE GAPS IN WHILE THERE WERE GREAT INTENTIONS AT THE TIME LINES CANDIDLY THE TIME LINES THAT WERE TOO OPTIMISTIC TOO AGGRESSIVE STATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LEGACY GROWERS IN THE STATE SMALL FAMILY FARMERS ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE NORTH COAST HAVE. HAD TO TRY TO MEET IMPOSSIBLE DEADLINES TO GET THAT LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET OFF THE GROUND. AND AGAIN I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH AT THE TIME LINES WERE SIMPLY TOO AGGRESSIVE FOR SMALL FAMILY FARMERS TO BE ABLE DO CHEAP THIS WE'VE LITERALLY SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS TRYING TO BRING ADDITIONAL SMALL FAMILY FARMERS INTO THE LIGHT IN IN THE COMPLIANCE WITH SEQUEL IN TO BECOME GOOD PARTNERS WHICH THEY ALL WANT TO DO. WITH THE ENVIRONMENT GROWERS ON THE NORTH COAST SMALL FAMILY FARMERSWANT TO HAVE ANNUAL LICENSES IN THE SEQUEL A INTO B. C. QUA COMPLIANT BUT THE PROCESS FOR EXISTING FARMERS TO COME OUT OF THE ILLICIT MARKET. HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING CHALLENGING AND OVERLY BURDENSOME AND BY THE WAY WE DO NOT DO THIS FOR ANY OTHER AGRICULTURAL CROP HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE WE DON'T DO IT FOR TOMATOES WE DON'T DO IT FOR GREAT SIN WE DON'T DO IT FOR SPARE KEYS. WHILE WE'VE CREATED A PROVISIONAL PROCESS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN EXTENDED IT A FEW TIMES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO GET THESE LEGACY FARMERS. THROUGH SEE WHAT NOW WE HAVE APPROVED THE HIGH MILLION TO HELP LOCALS WITH SEQUEL COMPLIANCE. WHICH IS FANTASTIC BUT BECAUSE IT'S SO LATE IN THE PROCESS THERE REMAINS CHALLENGES- IN WHILE WE WORK TO BRING THESE LEGACY FARMERS IN. PARTICULARLY ON THE NORTH COAST INTO COMPLIANCE AND GET THEM THEIR ANNUAL LICENSES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS DO NOT FALL OUT OF THE SYSTEM WHILE WE WORK THROUGH SUN SETTING. THE PROVISIONALS IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX AS THIS BILL PROPOSES. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE THAT CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN THE TRAILER BILL WILL BE CLEANED UP IN THE COMING WEEKS- THAT WILL DO THE FOLLOWING AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO CHEER SKINNER. SKINNER REALLY HAS BEEN LEADING THIS EFFORT AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF BETTER BUDGETARY. HERE'S WHERE MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL CLARIFY IN THE COMING WEEKS NUMBER ONE. CLEAR FIND THAT THE EXISTING PROVISIONS THAT WILL HAVE UNTIL JULY FIRST. THEY WILL HAVE UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO COMPLETE THEIR FINAL LAKE STREAMBED ALTERATION AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO GET THE PROVISIONALS RENEWED. NUMBER TWO. CLARIFYING THAT THE PROCESS DEMONSTRATES ETHICAL COMPLIANCE FOR RENEWALS AFTER TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND IT'LL BE RECOGNIZED EXISTING LOCAL PROCESSES APPROVED BY THE STATE TODAY THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY INVASION WITHIN A B. N. S. C. ONE FORTY ONE. THIS INCLUDES COUNTIES LIKE MENDOCINO IN THEIR APPROVED CHECKLIST PROCESS IN FINALLY MADAM CHAIR NOT DELAY THE DEADLINE IT WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. ESTABLISHED APPELLATIONS OF ORIGIN TO JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION ARE. COMMITTED TO THESE CLEANER PROVISIONS AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AT THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SALINAS- GONNA BE SUPPORTING A B. ONE FORTY ONE TODAY. PROP SIXTY FOUR REQUIRED TO STATE AND LOCAL TO LITERALLY BUILD THE PLANE WHILE WE'RE FLYING IT. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SMALL FAMILY FARMERS TRYING TO GET INTO THE ANNUAL LICENSE PROGRAM CAN DO SO WHILE ALSO RESPECTING ALL ISSUES WITH THE ENVIRONMENT- AND REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T FALL OUT OF THE SYSTEM. AND WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THIS WITH THESE UPCOMING AMENDMENTS INCLUDE- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE. DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDER WAY AND THAT THERE. IS WORK BEING DONE NOW TO GET LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE SMALL FARMERS AND THE RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND I WILL CALL ON SENATOR KABIR- BUT THEN I WOULD ALSO SEE WHETHER. ANY OF THE ADMINISTRATION REPRESENTATIVES WANT TO COMMENT GO AHEAD SENATOR CAFIERO BY PROBABLY SHOULD WAIT TO LISTEN TO THE ADMINISTRATION I GUESS PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE IS ARE AND I WANT TO. THANK THE GOOD SENATOR FROM. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THAT- WE USUALLY DON'T DO COMPLICATED SECRET TYPE OF. OF CHECK CHANGES- KIND OF ON THE FLY. AND I HAVE A LIST LIKE I SAID I'M I'M HEARING FROM MY LOCALS AND I'M HEARING FROM FROM THE COUNTY- I'M IN AND NOT VOTE TODAY RATHER THAN VOTE NO HOLE- WILL WILL BE TAKING THIS UP TOMORROW IN THE MEANTIME I'LL GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE LIST THAT I HAVE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ONE OF THE- THE THINGS THAT WAS THAT WAS ELIMINATED IN THE PROCESS. IS A NEGATIVE DECLARATION POSSIBILITY FOR SOME OF THAT- LICENSEES IN SEQUEL- THAT DON'T REQUIRE A FULL BLOWN PSYCHOANALYSIS. AND WHEN YOU START TINKERING WITH THAT KIND OF STUFF THEN YOU HAVE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ON SOME OF THE SMALLER AND SOME OF THE- THE- THE KINDS OF C. CORE PROCESS SEES WHERE THAT YOU WANT TO BE FAIR AND SO I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE LIST THAT WAS JUST. A PROPOSED BY MY GOOD FRIEND I WANT TO LOOK AT THE LIST THAT I'VE GOT. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. THAT I WAS WORKING VERY HARD ON OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD EVERYBODY. AT THE TABLE AND THAT WE WERE NOT. PREJUDICING BIG FARMERS AS OPPOSED TO SMALL FARMERS AND- EIGHT PLACES WHERE THERE HAD BEEN NO. ANNUAL LICENSE ISSUED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PROCESS IN THEIR COUNTY TO DO IT- WE WANT TO BE FAIR IN THIS AND FRANKLY WANT TO MAKE URE AGAIN THAT THOSE THAT HAVE GOTTEN A PROVISIONAL LICENSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WANT TO BE LEGAL THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WANT TO PLAY THE GAME AND REALLY WANT TO BE WITH US. WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT THE DRIVE HIM OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN A HASTY ACTION HERE IN THIS- UP PROCESS SO WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT EVERYBODY I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LIST AND HOPE I CAN GET THERE BY TOMORROW. SENATOR COPYRIGHT PRESHEAF YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT. ANYONE WHO HAS GONE TO THE TROUBLE WHETHER IT'S AT THE FULL ON LICENSE OR PROFESSIONAL. HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO OPERATE LEGALLY AND WE KNOW. THAT STILL. BE OF. UNFORTUNATELY THE ILLICIT MARKET IS LARGER STILL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEN THE LEGAL MARKET. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY MOVED TO LEGALIZE CANNABIS. AND SO WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. TO SUPPORT THAT LEGAL MARKET THAT WAS ITS INTENTION OF ITS CREATION. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT AS THEY SAY. THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. AND THAT THIS ONE- FROM. A NUMBER OF YOU IT'S CLEAR THIS ONE NEEDS MORE WORK. I THINK SENATOR DOLE YOU PUT YOUR MIKE UP GO AHEAD SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO ALSO.
