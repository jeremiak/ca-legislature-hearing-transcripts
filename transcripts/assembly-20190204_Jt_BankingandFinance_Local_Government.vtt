OF PERHAPS ABUSE --

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:28.158
OF PUBLIC DOLLAR FINE OF CITIES

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.094
ARE AREAS CAN YOU HELP US THINK

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.228
THROUGH WHAT THAT COULD LOOK

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:33.197
LIKE AND DB O. R. WHAT KINDS OF

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:34.331
CONCERNS.

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.766
MORE SPECIFICALLY YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:37.034
THOUGHT THAT ARE CURRENTLY THE

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:39.069
BANKING LAW WASN'T DESIGNED TO

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:40.938
ADDRESS POSSIBLE POLITICAL

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:42.306
INFLUENCES.

00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:44.541
ON AN EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.176
OR BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH IS

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.145
SOMETHING WE WOULD CONSIDER FOR

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:50.114
A PUBLIC ENTITY.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.616
HOWEVER WE WOULD ATTEMPT TO

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:53.684
ENSURE THAT DURING THE

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.019
APPLICATION PROCESS THE

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:57.421
INSTITUTION IS STRUCTURED.

00:45:57.488 --> 00:46:00.457
IN A WAY THAT PROHIBITS THOSE

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.025
TYPES OF INFLUENCES.

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:04.695
WE ALSO EXPECT THAT EVERYONE OF

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.597
OUR INSTITUTIONS NOW AND GOING

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:08.732
FORWARD HAS A CONFLICT OF

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:10.200
INTEREST POLICY.

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:12.669
AND WE WOULD EXAMINE AND

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:15.939
REGULATE TOWARDS BACK CONFLICT

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:17.441
OF INTERESTS POLICY.

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:20.711
AND WE WOULD ALSO WANT TO REVIEW

00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:22.112
IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.947
APPROPRIATE.

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:26.950
WE WELL CHECK FOR COMPLIANCE

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:28.952
WITH ALL POLICIES AND REVIEW

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:31.588
TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS LOANS

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:33.090
INVESTMENTS.

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:36.126
AND CONTRACTS AGAIN.

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:37.494
THIRD PARTY CONTRACTS AGAIN

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:40.497
BEFORE I AND DO INFLUENCE.

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:41.932
IF I AM DO INFLUENCE IS

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:43.667
DISCOVERED THE DEPARTMENT MAY

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:46.136
TAKE AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION TO

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.605
CORRECT THAT SITUATION.

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:49.873
SO WE DO HAVE ENFORCEMENT

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.174
AUTHORITY.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.542
BUT WHAT BUT WHAT I'M HEARING IS

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:53.110
ALSO THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:56.013
SOME CREATION OF REGULATIONS --

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:57.681
PROCESS --

00:46:57.748 --> 00:46:59.082
TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE AND

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.284
DO INFLUENCE --

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:03.520
IN ANY PARTICULAR WAY --

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:09.426
CAN YOU SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.562
THE IDEA THAT A PUBLIC BANK

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:14.231
WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM FDA SEE

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:14.531
[inaudible]

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:15.766
I INSURANCE [inaudible]

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:18.101
I KIM.

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.636
S. FIRST --

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:21.338
FOR STATE CHARTERED COMMERCIAL

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:23.507
BANKS THERE CURRENTLY IS NO

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:26.243
REQUIREMENT IN CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.579
TO BE INSURED [inaudible]

00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:30.380
HOWEVER.

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:32.316
THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATIONS

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:33.784
PROVIDE THE STATE CHARTERED

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.787
COMMERCIAL BANKS CANNOT OPERATE.

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:40.257
UNLESS THEY ARE INSURED BANK.

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:42.859
AN INSURED BANK IS DEFINED AND

00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:45.062
BACK INTO THE CODE THE FINANCIAL

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:48.765
CODE AS A BANK WHOSE DEPOSITS

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:50.334
ARE FDIC INSURED.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.369
IN OTHER WORDS THE DEPARTMENTS

00:47:52.436 --> 00:47:54.304
REGULATION REQUIRE STATE

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.673
CHARTERED COMMERCIAL BANKS TO BE

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.941
INSURED.

00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:59.476
HOWEVER.

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:01.812
THERE THE FINANCIAL CALLED ALSO

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:04.081
ALLOWS THE COMMISSIONER TO WAIVE

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:07.784
THE DEPARTMENTS REGULATIONS.

00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.820
THEREFORE IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.221
A STATE CHARTERED COMMERCIAL

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:14.057
BANK WHICH COULD OPERATE.

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:16.493
UNINSURED ARE PRIVATELY INSURED

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.663
IF APPROVED BY THE COMMISSIONER.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.398
LET ME GO A STEP FURTHER WE

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:23.367
WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE SOME TYPE

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.569
OF INSURANCE BUSINESS.

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:27.971
BECAUSE IT IS VITAL TO PROTECT

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:30.007
THE DEPOSITS OF THE PEOPLE AND

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:32.042
THE BUSINESSES A CALIFORNIA.

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:33.844
CURRENTLY THERE IS A PRIVATE

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:36.146
DEPOSIT INSURANCE MARKET BUT IT

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:37.881
IS TRULY ON DEVELOPED ALTHOUGH

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.549
SOME CREDIT UNIONS HAVE PRIVATE

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:41.818
CHAIR INSURANCE FROM A SINGLE

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:44.488
PRIVATE INSURER FOR THE COUNTRY.

00:48:44.554 --> 00:48:46.990
IT HAS YET TO BE DEMONSTRATED

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.592
THE CALIFORNIA BANKS CAN

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:51.261
SUCCESSFULLY OBTAINED A PRIVATE

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:55.299
INSURANCE.

00:48:55.365 --> 00:48:57.200
WE ALSO BELIEVE A PUBLIC BANK

00:48:57.267 --> 00:49:00.570
WOULD BE UNLIKELY. TO OBTAIN A

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:03.307
MASTER ACCOUNT FROM THE FEDERAL

00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:04.941
THE FEDERAL RESERVE IF IT DID

00:49:05.008 --> 00:49:07.944
NOT HAVE FTA SEE INSURANCE.

00:49:08.011 --> 00:49:11.715
OR A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE THAT

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:13.083
COULD WITHSTAND SCRUTINY.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.185
A MASTER ACCOUNT IS NEEDED TO

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.887
PERFORM MANY OF THE KEY

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:20.157
FUNCTIONS OF ANY BANK

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:20.457
[inaudible]

00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:22.359
THANK YOU [inaudible]

IN YOUR ROLE YOU'RE A MEMBER OF

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.366
THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:31.168
THE AYE BANKS CAN YOU SHARE YOUR

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:34.204
THOUGHTS OUR REACTIONS.

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:36.306
TO THE I. BANK BECOMING A

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:39.776
DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION --

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:43.046
SINCE THIS IS MY FOURTH WEEK ON

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:45.949
THE JOB I'M I'M GOING

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:46.249

TO YES. TO MISTER SCHAPER SINCE

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:50.654
I HAVEN'T SAT AT ONE OF THE AYE

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:52.856
BANK COMMITTEE MEET YET YET BUT

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:55.826
I I BETTER HAVE YOU.

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:57.627
SEC BECAUSE I MAY SAY IT WRONG.

00:49:57.694 --> 00:49:58.795
THE FUN NOT SURE I WILL SAY IT

00:49:58.862 --> 00:49:59.629
COMPLETELY RIGHT THAT I WILL DO

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:00.364
MY BEST TO HAVE THANK YOU FOR

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.997
THE QUESTION [inaudible]

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:05.902
THE THE AYE BANK WOULD.

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.137
HAVE TO CONFRONT SEVERAL

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:08.939
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND I'D

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:09.806
I'D.

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:10.707
PLEASE I DON'T WANT THE

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.376
COMMITTEE TO HEAR ME.

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:13.777
SAYING THESE ARE SHOW STOPPERS

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.613
JUST THINGS THAT AS POLICYMAKERS

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.382
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AS THE AYE

00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:19.516
BANK SHOT.

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:22.085
THE I. BANK HAS ONE LOCATION.

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:23.854
SO THAT WOULD THEN BEG THE

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.021
QUESTION.

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:26.723
HOW TO ACTUALLY REACH OUT AND

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.393
SERVICE THE INTENDED AUDIENCE?

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:31.628
BUT SINCE THE INTENDED AUDIENCE

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:34.064
IS STILL A MOVING TARGET IT

00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:35.132
WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO DROP

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.134
ANCHOR ON THAT.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.202
AND SECONDLY --

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:41.071
THE I BANK OF FOR ALL OF THE

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:42.439
GOOD IT DOES AND IT DOES A

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:44.141
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF GOOD IN

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:45.942
OUR STATE --

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:47.644
HAS SINCE ITS INCEPTION

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:50.547
GENERALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON EITHER

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.582
BECOMING A CONDUIT ISSUER OF

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:54.551
BONDS -- FOR

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:57.554
PROJECTS THAT ARE --

00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:02.926
TYPICALLY AB AND ENDING --

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:05.796
FOR TO ADMINISTER --

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:08.632
BORROWING PROGRAMS FOR THAT THAT

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:11.268
THAT INCORPORATE OTHER --

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:13.103
BORROWING PROGRAMS WITHIN THE

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.139
STATE THE THE AYE SURF PROGRAM

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.307
BEING ONE OF THEM AND I DON'T

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:18.775
PROFESS TO BE AN EXPERT ON THE

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.410
AYE BANKS BUSINESS GOES.

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:21.912
UNDER THE PAST ADMINISTRATION I

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.480
WAS ONLY THE ALTERNATE DELEGATE

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:24.815
TO THE AYE BANK BOARDS SO I'M

00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:25.982
SUFFERING FROM.

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:28.452
A FROM A THE A BIT OF IGNORANCE

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:30.020
ON THAT -- I

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:32.189
WOULD ALSO OBSERVE HOWEVER.

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:34.825
THAT AND THERE ARE --

00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:36.927
AT LEAST A MEASURABLE NUMBER OF

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:38.361
THE AYE BANK STAFF.

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:39.896
ARE EXPERIENCED COMMERCIAL

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.865
BANKERS AS WAS THE RECENTLY

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.534
RETIRED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:46.269
SO IT IS NOT AS THOUGH THE AYE

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:48.572
BANK IS WITHOUT THE MANAGEMENT

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:50.507
EXPERTISE --

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:51.074
AND SO PLEASE DON'T HEAR ME

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:52.242
SAYING THAT.

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:53.810
I DO BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT IT

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.512
WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:57.481
REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME

00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:59.282
OF THE KINDS OF PLANS THAT ARE

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:21.972

00:52:22.038 --> 00:52:22.973
THAT THE ALLIED BANK WOULD BE

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:24.474

WELL AGAIN NOT A SHOW STOPPER

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:28.445
BUT CLEARLY --

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.614
WOULD PRODUCE SOME FRICTION TO

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.182
HAVING THE AYE BANK.

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:34.684

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:41.224
THAT.

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:44.828
I ONE OF THE ROLES THAT'S REALLY

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.329
IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU PLAY IS AT

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:48.298
IN ENSURING THAT TAXPAYER FUNDS

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:50.033
ARE PROTECTED --

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.470
IN SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW.

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:54.938

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.706
KIND OF THESE AT THIS IDEA AND

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.341
HOW.

00:52:58.408 --> 00:53:00.143
THE TREASURES DEPARTMENT WOULD.

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.178
ENSURE THAT TAXPAYERS FUNDS WERE

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:03.513
PROTECTED.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.814
IF THIS WAS A MODEL THAT WAS

00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:07.817
BEING CONSIDERED IF THERE WAS A

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:10.353
STRUGGLING BANK --

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:10.720
PUBLIC BANK --

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:11.621
HAVE RIGHT NOW --

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:12.756
SO LIKE ARE PULLED MONEY

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:14.491
INVESTMENT FUND IT'S ABOUT

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:15.659
NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS BUT

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:17.694
IT IS STATE MONEY AND LOCAL

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.162
MONEY THAT IS ESSENTIALLY.

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:21.197
SPOKEN FOR SO IT'S NOT MONEY

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:23.199
SITTING AROUND --

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:26.670
WE CANNOT RISK PUT IT UP AS

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:29.673
CAPITAL AND WHAT I BELIEVE IF WE

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:31.841
WANTED TO DO A LOCAL BANK IS

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:33.643
THAT IT HAS TO BE A SEPARATE

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.345
LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET.

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:37.547
YOU CAN NOT ENCUMBER FUNDS THAT

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:40.250
ARE ALREADY BEING USED OR SET

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:42.786
ASIDE FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:44.487
MOST OF HE WALKING FROM LOCAL

00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.189
GOVERNMENT SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:47.223
THAT WHEN.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:48.692
YOU KNOW SOMEONE WANTS TO USE

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.827
THAT FUND TO CAPITALIZE IN

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:52.596
ANOTHER ONE THAT IS REALLY NOT.

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:54.331
YOU KNOW OUR MONEY TO DO IT THAT

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:56.099
IT IS YOU KNOW FOR SET ASIDE FOR

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.734
THE SCHOOLS ARE HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.269

COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:14.417
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IF WE ARE

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:17.454
MANAGING THEIR MONEY ABOUT.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.888
TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.824
THAT AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IT

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.993
THROUGH KIND OF A PORTAL --

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.995
SYSTEM THAT THEY CAN DEPOSIT

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:27.230
EASIER AND ALSO WITHDRAW THE

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.898
FUNDS AS NEEDED SO THERE'S NO

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:30.634
PAPER TRANSACTIONS ANYMORE BUT

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.768
IT IS ALL.

00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:33.403

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.147
THE POTENTIAL OF A RAT RECESSION

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:46.716

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:48.251

INDUSTRY CREATING --

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.411
A SITUATION WHERE LOCAL

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.268
DRAMATIC LOSS OF LOCAL AND

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.037
ESPECIALLY COMMUNITY BANKS.

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:42.372
WE KNOW THAT THE LOSS OF LOCAL

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.040

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:46.042
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKERS.

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.520
SYSTEM.

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:59.489
WE BELIEVE REGIONAL PUBLIC

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:00.957
BANKING CAN HELP US TO CREATE A

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:03.192
MORE RESILIENT FINANCIAL SYSTEM

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:03.659

GOVERNMENTS.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.063
FIRST PUBLIC BANKS WOULD ALLOW

CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.633
TO CREATE SOUND INVESTMENTS THAT

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.101
WILL SAVE THEM MONEY.

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.436
AND ALLOW THEM TO INVEST THEIR

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:14.837

RESPONSIBLE ACTIVITIES.

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:21.277
SECOND PUBLIC BANKS CAN SAVE

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.046
TAXPAYER FUNDS AND BRING THEIR

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:24.580
TREMENDOUS BANKING BUSINESS BACK

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.582

01:01:26.649 --> 01:01:28.084
THAT BUSINESS IS CURRENTLY

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.886
DOMINATED BY WALL STREET BANKS

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.921
INSTEAD WE CAN USE THOSE FUNDS.

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.990
IN THE LOCAL BANKING SECTOR.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:35.458
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL BANKS

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.826
AND CREDIT UNIONS PUBLIC BANKS

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.795
CAN PROVIDE AFFORDABLE LOANS AND

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.830
LINES OF CREDIT TO LOCAL SMALL

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.331
BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS.

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.366
THAT CAN PROVIDE A CRITICAL BALL

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:44.767
WAR AGAINST DISPLACEMENT OF

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:46.169
COMMUNITY SERVING ANCHOR

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.770
INSTITUTIONS.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:48.805
PUBLIC BANKS CAN INCREASE THE

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.273
LANDING CAPACITY OF THE LOCAL

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.208

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.980
BANKS.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.215
THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.416
ALLIANCE BRINGS TOGETHER

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.285

UP TO EUREKA IN HUMBOLDT.

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:11.828
OUR VISION IS A NETWORK OF

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.596
PUBLIC BANKS THIRD ARE OWNED AT

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:15.064
THE REGIONAL COUNTY AND

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:17.200
MUNICIPAL LEVELS.

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.335
OUR PROPOSAL IS A CHARTER BASED

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:22.171
APPROACH. TO PUBLIC BANKING AND

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.739
BY THAT I MEAN WE ARE NOT

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:24.774
SEEKING TO LEGISLATE IN YOUR

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.142
BANK.

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:27.210
WE ARE SEEKING TO PROVIDE A

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:29.112
PATHWAY SO THAT LOCALITIES CAN

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:31.380
CREATE THEM.

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.249
THE ALLIANCE'S TWO THOUSAND

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:33.850
NINETEEN GOAL IS TO INTRODUCE

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:34.917
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CREATE A

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.419
CLEAR PATHWAY. FOR THE

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.987
DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:40.089
TO LICENSE AND REGULATE LOCAL

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:41.290
PUBLIC BANKS.

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:43.292
THEY WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:44.627
SPECIAL PURPOSE COMMERCIAL BANKS.

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:45.795
THEY WOULD BE SEPARATE LEGAL

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:47.296
ENTITIES FROM THEIR PUBLIC

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:48.331
SHAREHOLDERS.

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.332
THESE BANKS WOULD HAVE SEPARATE

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:52.268
INDEPENDENT BOARD STAFF BY

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:53.736
BANKING PROFESSIONALS.

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:55.138
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.372
COMMISSIONER <i><u>AN HAS JUST TOLD</i></u>

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.674
US THE PROCESS BY WHICH YOU FORM

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.209
A BANK IN CALIFORNIA.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.545
SHE TOLD US BY BUT THE EXTENSIVE

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.548
pORGANIZER'S A BANKS AND THEIR

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.782
BOARDS OF DIRECTORS WE'RE

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.784
PROPOSING TO USE THE SYSTEM THAT

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.785
WE ALREADY HAVE.

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:11.754
AND APPLY IT TO LOCAL PUBLIC

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:13.723
BANKS.

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:14.891
WE BELIEVE THE CHARTER APPROACH

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.893
TO PUBLIC BANKING ENABLES OUR

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:17.894
REGIONS TO BE.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.729
THAT BECOME PATHWAYS PUBLIC

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:20.796
FINANCE.

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.431
NOT ONE IN WHICH LOCALITIES

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:24.400
DECIDE IF THEY WANT BANKS HOW

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.968
THEY WANT BANKS AND WENT TO

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.103
LAUNCH THEM.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.771
BY DECENTRALIZING THE SUPPORT HE

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.406
TO CALIFORNIA'S REGIONS WE

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.841
BELIEVE WE ARE DIVERSIFYING THE

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:34.777
RISKS OF PUBLIC BANKING AS WELL

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.145
AS DIVERSIFYING ITS REWARDS.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:37.380
IN OUR VISION PUBLIC BANKS WILL

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:38.247
BE CREATED TO MEET THE

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:39.549
PARTICULAR NEEDS OF LOCAL

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:41.250
ECONOMIES WHETHER IT IS

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.685

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:46.989
BUSINESSES AND NONPROFIT

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:49.125
AGENCIES.

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.426
IN ADDITION AFTER CONSULTING

TAKEN FEEDBACK AND I DON'T

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:00.169
BELIEVE THAT REMOVING COLLATERAL

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.072
FOR THESE BANKS --

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:03.940

RELATIONSHIP NORTH DAKOTA HAS

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.134
MORE BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS PER

PERSON AS A COUNTRY OVERALL.

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:43.145
IN WHAT THE COURT --

WE KNOW THAT'S THROUGH THE

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:59.695
RELATIONSHIP THAT THIS BANK HAS

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:01.430

ANY OTHER STATE --

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:29.859
AND A KEY PRIORITY FOR THE BANK

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:30.626
UNIT IN NORTH DAKOTA IS TO

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.161
MAINTAIN A STRONG AND STABLE

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:33.729
BALANCE SHEET TO PROTECT

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:34.897
TAXPAYER MONEY.

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:36.899
THIS IS THE VISION FOR THE TYPES

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.501
OF PUBLIC BANKS WE WANT TO SEE

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:40.202
SPREAD THROUGH THE STATE OF

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:44.907
CALIFORNIA THANK YOU.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.143
THANK YOU.

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:49.111
DICK MAZES.

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.513
OKAY MY NAME IS --

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.081
DICK MAYES THIS AND I KNOW

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.582
NOTHING ABOUT BANKING START OFF

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:55.451
WITH I'M A RETIRED PROFESSOR.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.753
IN MEDICAL PHYSICS OF ALL THINGS

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.722
IS THE BALLOT FOR REMOVED FROM

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.390
BANKING AS ONE CAN GET.

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.792
AND AYE MOVED TO CALGARY TARGETS

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:05.294
CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN YEARS AGO.

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.763
AND VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE I

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:10.700
MUST SAY --

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.335
WHAT I?

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:13.202
WHEN A I THINK BROUGHT ME TO

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:13.969
THIS WAS LOOKING AT

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.638
INFRASTRUCTURE MORE THAN

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.373
ANYTHING?

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.575
AND LOOKING AT AT HOW

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.544
INFRASTRUCTURE FX DIFFERENT

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.512
SOCIETIES I LIVED IN HIGHLY AND

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.948
PERU FOR ABOUT TWO OR THREE

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.516
YEARS AND THEY HAD.

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.251
ESSENTIALLY NO INFRASTRUCTURE

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:30.553
AND NO SUPPORT PUBLIC

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.621
INFRASTRUCTURE AND A GREAT DEAL

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:33.823
OF INEQUALITY.

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.324
I ALSO LIVED IN ANOTHER PLACE

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:38.828
CALLED IT'S TAKEN CARE OF EVERY

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:41.630
BIT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS TAKEN

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.899
CARE OF BY.

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:45.267
THE THE GOVERNMENT.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.703
SO THEY HAVE NOT ONLY THE

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:52.074
EDUCATION HEALTH CARE ROADS.

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:54.076
ALL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.579
UTILITIES EVERYTHING IS

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.848
SUPPORTED GOVERNMENTAL WAY AND

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:01.584
THIS CONSEQUENCE OF THAT THEY DO

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.519
HAVE INEQUALITY SOME PEOPLE ARE

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:05.588
DRIVING MASERATI SINCE SUMMER

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.289
DRIVING OLD VOLVOS --

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:08.991
BUT BASICALLY EVERYTHING IS

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.359
TAKEN CARE OF FOR THE GREAT

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:12.294
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.764
CREATES A GREAT SOLIDITY A

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:16.899
FEELING OF HAVING EVERYTHING

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:19.969
TAKEN CARE OF BY THE GOVERNMENT

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.871
BY THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:23.339
HOW DID THEY ACHIEVE THAT AND

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:24.807
BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:27.576
SUPPLIES FUNDS FOR DOING SO?

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.678
AND THE I THINK THAT COULD ALSO

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:32.648
BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:33.849
WHY I LOOK AT THIS --

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.017
WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:37.887
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S CURRENTLY

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:39.488
I THINK EIGHT HUNDRED BILLION IN

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.490
NEARLY BONDS THE STATE MAY HAVE

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.058
A HUNDRED BILL YEAH AND AND

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:43.993
LOCAL.

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:46.061
ENTITIES HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:47.763
BILLION THE STATE IS PAYING MATH

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.698
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.434
THIRTY YEARS ON AVERAGE.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.169
THE LOCAL ENTITIES ARE PAYING

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.271
ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:58.507
BILLION A YEAR IN A AND INTEREST

01:07:58.574 --> 01:07:59.074
COST.

01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:03.412
OVER AN AVERAGE THIRTY YEAR NEW

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:05.314
KNEES --

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:09.151
FROM LOCAL OR FROM PROPERTY TAX

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:11.554
AND SALES TAX THEY ALL GO TO THE

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.824
TOP 2% OF THE POPULATION.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:17.893
WHO ARE SEEKINGTO EVADE OR?

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.628
ELIMINATE --

01:08:19.695 --> 01:08:21.297
PERSONAL INCOME TAX.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.865
AND THE THERE IS NO PERSONAL

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:26.235
INCOME TAX ON THAT SO BASICALLY --

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:29.338
THE SAME GROUP IT PAYS 50% OF

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:31.040
THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX IS

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.775
GETTING A BREAK FROM THE

01:08:32.842 --> 01:08:34.743
MUNICIPAL BOND.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:38.280
ISSUANCE --

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:41.484
THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.419
THE COURSE THE BONDS WELL FIRST

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.287
OF ALL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WE

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:46.956
KNOW OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS ARE

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.257
COMING TO A TRILLION DOLLARS AND

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:50.493
THAT'S BEEN IN THE GOVERNMENT

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:50.759
BUDGETS --

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:54.396
THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET OFFICE

01:08:54.463 --> 01:08:56.131
HAS -- SHOWN

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:57.666
THAT AND IT'S GOING TO BE

01:08:57.733 --> 01:09:00.402
BASICALLY AT HIGHER COST.

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.104
THE A BONDS NEARLY BONTA USED TO

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.273
BE 3% ARE GOING TO GO 24% OR

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.608
MORE.

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:06.942
AND SO THE COST IN TERMS OF

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.911
INTEREST COST IS GOING TO GO UP

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:12.081
QUITE A BIT AND WE CAN EXPECT

01:09:12.147 --> 01:09:13.415
MORTGAGE EVEN MORE DEBT --

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.884
PARTICULARLY FROM LOCAL ENTITIES

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.252
IN THE FUTURE.

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:18.220
AND I WAS VERY CONCERNED WITH

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.889
THIS BECAUSE I FELT THAT.

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:22.091
WE REALLY OR TO DO SOMETHING AND

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:24.193
HOW DO WE BEGIN TO ADDRESS IT

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.895
WELL STATE BANK OF COURSE COULD

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:28.497
ADDRESS IT --

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.199
PRETTY DRESS THE BASIC PROBLEM

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:31.100
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:33.602
OF TAXATION A LOT OF WHAT WE

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:37.239
MIGHT CALL REGRESSIVE TAXATION

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:38.340
INTERPRETED MUNICIPAL BONDS

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:40.576
VERSUS THE PROGRESSIVE TAXATION.

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:44.146
OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX.

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:44.547
UP.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.048
BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT THING I

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:49.251
THINK IS THAT THE PUBLIC BANKS.

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:53.155
WHETHER STATE OR LOCAL OR AS I

01:09:53.222 --> 01:09:54.823
PREFERRED THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.625
BANK CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.794
BANK -- IT

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:02.064
BASICALLY CUT THE MUNICIPAL BOND

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:04.767
INTEREST RATES GREAT DEAL.

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:09.104
AND COULD DO SO VERY EASILY --

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.773
BASICALLY AND I'LL JUST CUT TO

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.908
THE END AND I'VE GIVEN A LOT

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.144
INFORMATION HERE IN MY RIGHT UP.

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:18.681
THE KEY POINT IS THAT.

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.583
THE INTEREST COST WOULD

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:22.685
BASICALLY GO THAT MONEY THAT

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:23.886
THAT.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.088
MUNICIPALITIES PAY IN TERMS OF

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:28.324
THEIR PROPERTY TAX AND SALES TAX

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:32.127
COULD BASICALLY GO. TO FINANCE

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:34.630
THE DIE THE PASTA COSTS BY THE

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:36.231
SAME PUBLIC ENTITIES.

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.867
AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT A

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:40.369
PUBLIC BANKS SHOULD ONLY

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:42.171
DIRECTLY DEAL WITH PUBLIC

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:44.640
ENTITIES WHETHER TO STATE BANK.

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:48.644
OR MUNICIPAL BANK --

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:51.847
FOR THE IN THE EXISTING.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:52.982
CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:55.517
DEVELOPMENT AND BANK ALL THE ALL

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:58.354
THE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:03.659
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS --

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.294
HOMES SO --

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:06.895
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ETCETERA CAN

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:08.897
BE DONE THROUGH INTERMEDIARIES

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:10.699
RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IT CAN BE

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:13.135
DONE THROUGH AS THE HIGH BANK.

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.069
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:15.671
CURRENTLY DOES THROUGH LOAN

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:19.274
GUARANTEES TO SEE DFI BACK OVER

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.176
TO CREDIT UNIONS THEY DON'T LOAN

01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:22.778
THE MONEY DIRECTLY AT ALL.

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:25.047
A PROVIDE LOAN GUARANTEES TO

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.082
THOSE WHO DO SO AND I THINK

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:28.484
THAT'S THE WAY A PUBLIC BANK

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.686
SHOULD OPERATE NOT DIRECTLY WITH

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:32.554
SMALL BUSINESSES NOT DIRECTLY

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.023
WITH INDIVIDUALS.

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:36.892
BUT THROUGH PUBLIC AGENCIES

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.460
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:41.697
PUBLIC BANK FOR PUBLIC --

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:44.299
ENTITIES OR BASICALLY ANOTHER

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.368
TERM LIFE USES A CREDIT UNION

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:48.704
FOR MUNICIPALITIES AND THAT'S

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:51.573
PROBABLY THE UNDERLYING IDEA

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.875
THAT I'VE GOT FROM MY LIFE IN

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:54.910
WISCONSIN WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.645
CREDIT UNIONS.

01:11:56.712 --> 01:12:00.049
HOW CAN DO SOME DO SO WELL

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.617
BASICALLY?

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:03.552
WE NEED --

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:04.653
DEPOSITS BIG CHALLENGE AND I PUT

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.854
THIS DOWN IN THIS RIGHT UP YOU

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:07.456
NEED TO POLITICS AND HOW DO YOU

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.424
GET ALL THAT THE POSITS WELL.

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:09.825
THE DAY.

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:12.461
THE THE PRIVATE BANKS I DON'T

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:13.562
CALL THEN COMMERCIAL BANKS

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.863
PRIVATE BANKS.

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.566
OR PROVIDING RELATIVELY.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:20.169
LOW INTEREST PAYMENTS ON SHORT

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:22.271
TERM DEPOSITS AND I THINK MANY

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:23.706
PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE GETTING HALF

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:24.606
A PERCENT.

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:25.474
I KNOW SOME OF THE PUBLIC

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:29.778
PENSION FUNDS QUITE A BIT LOWER

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:30.979
ON SOME OF THEIR SHORT TERM

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.815
DEPOSITS THERE'S ABOUT TRILLION

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.349
DOLLARS IN PUBLIC.

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.552
PENSION FUNDS IN CALIFORNIA HALF

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.153
OF THAT IS IN CALPERS AND CAL

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.122
STARS WHICH RUN THEIR OWN MONEY

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.090
MANAGEMENT.

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:43.425
BUT THE OTHER FIVE HUNDRED

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.960
BILLION THAT'S OUT THERE.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.162
AND 1% OF THAT IS THE SHORT TERM

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:48.163
MONEY THAT NEEDS MONEY

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:49.832
MANAGEMENT.

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:50.666
ARE NOT GETTING ANY INTEREST AT

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.868
ALL ON AND WAYNE MORRIS WRITTEN

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:55.037
A NICE ARTICLE ON THAT SHOWING

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.039
THAT THE HIGH BANK THE EXISTING

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:59.641
AYE BANK WOULD BE A GOOD VEHICLE

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:02.578
FOR MANAGING. FOR THOSE FUNDS --

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.947
THAT'S ALSO TRUE FOR MANY PUBLIC

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:06.181
ENTITIES.

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:08.050
I KNOW THAT PUBLIC ENTITIES PUT

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.384
THEIR MONEY AND WHATEVER BOUGHT

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:13.088
A PRIVATE BANK IS AVAILABLE

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:13.322
LOCALLY.

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:14.356
AND THEN.

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:16.024
EVERY DAY OR EVERY WEEK THEY'LL

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:18.494
TAKE THE EXCESS RESERVES THAT

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.129
THEY HAVE THE X. THAT'S DEPOSIT.

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:22.131
A SPIN IT OFF INTO A HIGHER

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:24.299
RETURN LIKE --

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:25.667
CAMPUS ONE OF THEM THE

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:27.302
CALIFORNIA ASSET MANAGEMENT

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:28.570
PROGRAM.

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:30.072
AND THEY'LL GET 2% OF TWO AND A

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:33.208
HALF PERCENT WITH THEIR EXCESS

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:34.610
DEPOSITS OR RESERVES.

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.411
THE REAL KEY IS TO GET ENOUGH

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:39.982
RESERVES FOR THE AYE BANK IN

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:43.185
EXISTING AYE BANK. TO MAKE LOANS

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:46.755
AND CAN DO THE SICKLY --

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:50.159
INSURING THAT YOU GET VERY GOOD --

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:53.228
RETURNS ON YOUR DEPOSIT.

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:54.663
AND THE RETURNS ON THINKING

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:57.599
ABOUT IFYOU HAVE A 3% LOAN TO A

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.669
PRIOR TO A MUNICIPALITY TO LOCAL

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.806
AND IT A GIFT 2% ACTED THE

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:04.807
MUNICIPALITY.

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:08.310
AND BASICALLY CHARGE 1% FOR A

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.711
LOAN INSTEAD OF 4%.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.680
THE 1% IS THE COVER OPERATIONAL

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:14.283
COSTS OF THE BANK AND ALSO TO

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:16.552
PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF PROFIT

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:17.953
FOR RETAINED EARNINGS TO

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.888
INCREASE YOUR CAPITAL SHOULD BE

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.390
CAN DO MORE LINES YOU HAVE TO

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:23.592
HAVE SOME RETAINED EARNINGS. TO

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:24.960
DO TO DO LOANS --

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.696
INCREASE YOUR LOAN CAPACITY.

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.231
SO I THINK THAT COULD BE DONE.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.133
WHY WOULD I CHOOSE THE AYE BANK

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.634
RATHER THAN A NEW BANK TO DO

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:33.569
THIS?

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.337
I THINK BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.439
EXISTING AGENCY YOU HAVE

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:38.874
EXISTING STAFF --

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.742
YOU HAVE THERE ARE AS WE HEARD

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.811
FROM KEN STEVENS THEIR EXISTING

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:45.347
PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCE PRIVATE

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.482
BANKERS --

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:49.384
WE CAN EXPAND ON THAT.

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:52.554
DAY HAVE A AN ABILITY THEY HAVE

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:54.857
TO CONTACT THE HAVE EXTENSIVE

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:59.695
PROGRAMS TO EAT A EVALUATE LOANS.

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:04.600
THEY HAVE A ALSO FOR DOING LOAN

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:08.370
GUARANTEES TO A VARIETY OF THE

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:10.239
EIGHTY ONE C. DFI BANKS IN

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:12.307
CALIFORNIA THE TO A VARIETY OF A

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:13.976
CREDIT UNIONS PROVIDED THERE

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.011
OVER IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER THREE

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.079
YEARS -- SO

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:19.414
THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS OF

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:23.652
DIRECTING FUNDS TO ACTUAL USE

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:25.587
FOR OTHER THAN THE MUNICIPALITY

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.589
ITSELF THROUGH THE LOAN

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:28.757
GUARANTEES.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:31.126
THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS IS

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.762
THAT BY EXPANDING THE AYE BANK

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:36.031
IT WOULD TAKE VERY LITTLE TIME

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:37.466
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A BIG TWO

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:38.400
YEAR STUDY.

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:40.869
AND DO ALL THE THINGS YOU HAVE

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.004
TO DO WITH THE NEW BANK

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.307
BASICALLY YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO OR

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:46.808
THREE YEAR PERIOD.

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.343
PROBABLY A TWO YEAR PERIOD TO

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:50.279
DEVELOP A PLAN FOR THE FEDERAL

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:52.047
RESERVE.

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:55.384
AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:58.420
FUNCTIONING PUBLIC BANK --

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.989
THAT WOULD WORK TO PROVIDE THESE

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.759
LOANS TO MUNICIPALITIES

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:07.663
ESSENTIALLY 1% --

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:08.997
IT WOULD BE CALM THE MONEY

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:11.600
MANAGER FOR THE SHORT TERM FUNDS

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:14.169
NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY AS MANY

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:16.138
BANKS DO THEY SPEND THE SOFTENED

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:18.006
ABOUT A QUARTER PERCENT TO MONEY

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.541
MANAGEMENT FIRMS THAT ACTUALLY

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:21.510
DO IT THAT EXPERIENCE THAT MONEY

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:22.244
MANAGEMENT.

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:25.080
BUT THE NAME ON THE ACCOUNT

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.915
WOULD BE THE AYE BANK ACCOUNT.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.617
SO IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE TO DO

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:30.719
THIS THE AYE BANK TODAY HAS

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:32.387
REQUEST FOR OVER A BILLION

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:35.123
DOLLARS OF LOANS THEY ISSUE

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.692
ABOUT SIXTY MILLION.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:38.527
OF LOANS THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:39.628
FUNDS TO DO THE LOAN STATE THE

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:41.296
CONDUIT LOANS FOR A BILLION

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.231
DOLLARS A YEAR THROUGH MUNICIPAL

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:45.100
CHANNELS THEY COULD THEY COULD

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.902
FUND THOSE --

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.670
THOSE STATE AGENCY LOANS

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:51.340
THEMSELVES WERE THEY TO BECOME --

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:55.210
A A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SO I

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.778
THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT IN

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:59.081
CONTRAST TO ALL OTHER THINGS WE

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.248
HAVE AN EXISTING AGENCY.

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:02.985
FINANCIAL AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:04.486
THAT COULD DO THE JOB.

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:07.522
IT WOULD BE A SLOW BUILD UP.

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:11.193
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE BASICALLY

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:13.061
THAT WOULD BE EXPANDING WHICH

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:14.696
SHOW YOU HOW.

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:17.232
A PUBLIC BANK COULD OPERATE AND

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:19.534
SHOW YOU ANY THE DIFFICULTIES

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:20.736
YOU HAVE WITH IT AND IT.

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.738
MAY NOT BECOME THE STATE PUBLIC

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.406
BANK LITTLE SURE PROVIDE

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.242
GUIDANCE FOR HEALTH BECOME

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:27.542
[inaudible]

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:30.112
ONE THANK YOU.

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:31.013
THANK YOU BOTH THAT TWO

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:33.482
DIFFERENT IDEAS AND MODELS.

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:36.151
OF OF WHAT WE COULD IT ENVISION

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:38.787
THE FUTURE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:43.091

I HAVE A FEW COMING FROM LOCAL

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.662
GOVERNMENT THIS MAKES ME NERVOUS

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.297
SO -- CAN

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:50.699
YOU EXPLAIN HOW PUBLIC AGENCY

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.467
BANK CAN BE COMPETITIVE WITH THE

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:54.236
LARGER COMMERCIAL BANKS THE

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:19.761
LOT OF MONEY ONE UNIX NONE OF IT

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.496
COMES BACK TO THE NONE OF IT

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:23.298
COMES BACK TO THE ISSUE.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:26.034
GROUP HSA AITCHISON EXPENDITURE.

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:27.903
WHEREAS IF YOU IF THE IF THE

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:29.871
MUNICIPALITIES ARE INVESTING IN

THE AYE BANK THE AYE BANK WILL

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.341
RETURN.

PROFITABLY SICKLY YOU GET

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:45.020
MUNICIPAL LOANS 41%.

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:48.223
VERSUS 4% THAT'S A HUGE SAVINGS

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:51.326
IN TERMS OF WHAT A PROPERTY TAX

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:56.431
AND SALES TAX.

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:57.532
THE THE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:59.101
IT'S ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS SOCIAL

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:02.237
BENEFIT THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY.

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:04.039
AT AM REGION'S HAVING BANKS THAT

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:06.408
ARE FINANCING THE SOCIAL

PURPOSES FOR LIKE AFFORDABLE

DEPOSITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.316
AN OUT OF STATE BANKS PUTTING

THEM INTO A NEW INSTITUTION.

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.787
AND USING THAT AS A BASE FOR

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:20.555
THESE.

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:23.859
TYPES OF ACTIVITIES --

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:24.426

OPINION OUR LOCAL AGENTS IS

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.608
GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:42.277
COMMERCIAL BANKS IN RELATION TO

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:45.347
THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:45.647
[inaudible]

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:50.752
THE COMPETITION.

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.487
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I I WOULD

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:53.455
LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WHAT

AGENCY.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:09.237
AND IT COULD BE CHARGING FEES

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.872
FOR THE SERVICES.

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:12.440
THAT IS PROVIDING THAT LOCAL

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:13.642
GOVERNMENT.

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:14.910
BUT IT.

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.112
THE IDEA OF COMPETITION IN TERMS

I'M NOT SURE.

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:20.282
AND ARE YOU SAYING COMPETITIVE

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:23.018

RETURN THAT THAT LOCAL AGENCY

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:26.054
WOULD BE GETTING.

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.556
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:28.957
PROPOSING TO YOU IS THAT THE

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:30.659
PURPOSE OF THIS BANK ISN'T JUST

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.160

GOVERNMENT'S GETTING IT'S ALL OF

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:35.430
THE BENEFICIAL USES OF THOSE

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:36.631
DEPOSITS.

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:38.633
IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.871
I I GET THE SO I UNDERSTAND HOW

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:43.705
WHERE YOU FOR SEE THIS MAY BE

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:46.208
HAPPY AND URBAN AREAS AND HAVING

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:48.343
REGIONALISATION FOR BANKS.

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:50.745
MY FEAR IS WE ARE VERY BIG STATE.

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.247
AND HOW THIS WOULD AFFECT OUR

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:53.782
RURAL COMMUNITIES WOULD THEY BE

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:55.483
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE WOULD THEY

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.818
BE ABLE TO HAVE THE STAFFING TO

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:57.719
DO THAT.

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.654
DO THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.056
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO I'M

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:02.524
SITTING OUT HERE LOOKING AT THE

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.092
ENTIRE STATE AND I HEAR.

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:05.026
A LOT ABOUT THE LARGEST

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:08.697
COMMUNITIES WILL BE ABLE TO PULL

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:09.898
THIS OFF --

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:11.967
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:12.567
LOOK AT THIS IS A STATE WIDE

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:13.501
ISSUE.

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:15.270
SO -- THAT'S

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:15.837
WHAT I'M JUST KIND OF GOING

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.706
THROUGH --

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:18.673
TODAY JUST --

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.507
GIVE ART SO THE ALLIANCE

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:22.310
INCLUDES RURAL AREAS WE HAVE --

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:24.312
CHAPTERS GOING UP TO EUREKA

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:25.880
HUMBOLDT WE HAVE --

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:27.415
MEMBERS HERE WILL GIVE PUBLIC

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:29.918
TESTIMONY ABOUT THE WILD FIRES

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:31.553
IN THE FACT ON THEM FROM SANTA

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:35.290
ROSA AND OUR WE BELIEVE THAT.

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:36.591
A CHARTER BASED APPROACH TO THAT

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:38.393
PUBLIC BANKING IS A MODULAR

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:39.961
FLEXIBLE APPROACH BECAUSE IT

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:42.397
ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO JOIN

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.599
FORCES AT A REGIONAL COUNTY OR

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.134
MULTI COUNTY LEVEL.

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:48.536
WHATEVER MAKES SENSE FINANCIALLY

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:51.106
TO AT WHAT SCALE IT MAKES SENSE

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.774
TO PROP UP A BANK.

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:54.075
IN SAN FRANCISCO MIGHT BE JUST

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:55.043
THE CITY AND COUNTY SAN

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:57.178
FRANCISCO BUT IT COULD BE AT A

01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:58.446
DIFFERENT BANK SERVICE SEVERAL

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:04.185
COUNTIES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:06.755
CAN LOOK FOR THE OTHER TO

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:09.758
TESTIMONY.

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:13.928
ANY OTHER QUITE YES [inaudible]

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:18.733
CHAIR I I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND --

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.467
WHAT?

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.202
THE BENEFITS OF DHEA.

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.438
IDEA PUBLIC BANG SOME MORE

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:26.141
PUBLIC BANKS AT THAT WERE YOU.

01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:27.976
EVENTUALLY SAVE CONSUMERS SO

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:34.416
FROM THE HI [inaudible]

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.951
COST ABA.

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:39.321
LOANS CONSUMER LOANS SO MORE

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:41.589
BANGS SO WOULD BE BETTER IF MORE

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:44.459
PUBLIC BANDS WOULD BE BETTER.

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:45.593
THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING IN MY

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.863
CORRECT [inaudible]

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:52.901
THE OKAY FINAL QUESTION THAT A

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:53.902
WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET AT THE IF

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:56.237
THIS OF CORRECT THE IDEA THAN.

01:22:56.304 --> 01:22:58.006
THE UP PUBLICLY.

01:22:58.073 --> 01:22:59.374
US SUBSIDIZED A GOVERNMENT

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:02.677
SUBSIDIZED PUBLIC BANKS.

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:05.647
IN ON MAY PROVIDE LOW INTEREST.

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:06.981
TO CONSUME LESS A WHOLE.

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:08.283
THEN THE WHAT ABOUT THE NEGATIVE

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:11.319
CAUGHT UP CONSEQUENCES TO THE

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:12.554
COMMERCIAL EXISTING COMMERCIAL

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.621
BANKS SO.

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:17.125
I COME FROM THE CITY OF OUR BY.

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.960
AS SO MANY BAGS SO EVEN ONE

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.628
SHOPPING CENTER THREE FOUR

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:21.596
DIFFERENT BANDS.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:25.200
I OFTEN WONDER HOW THE SELF.

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:25.467
FIVE IN --

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:28.770
SO IF WE ADD THE MORE PUBLIC

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:29.871
VETTING SO WITH A MOLE.

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:33.308
TOUR SO FOR THEM TO COMPETE

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.543
AGAINST A COMMERCIAL BANDS OUT.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.912
IT IS THIS IDEA TO KILL THE

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:40.815
EXISTING COMMERCIAL BATTLES.

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:42.283
SO THAT THE LET ME RESPOND TO

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.151
BOTH QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE IS

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:47.222
WE THE PRIMARY CUSTOMERS OF THE

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:49.791
THANKS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING ARE

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.226
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.694
THEY WOULD BE THE PRIMARY

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:54.295
DEPOSITORS IN THESE BANKS.

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:56.531
AND THE BANK'S BUSINESS LINES

01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:58.199
THEIR PRODUCTS --

01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.801
OUR PROPOSAL.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.669
IS THAT WHEREVER THEY'RE DOING

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:03.037
RETAIL BANKING.

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:05.206
IT IS TO BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:07.108
WITH LOCAL FINANCIAL

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:08.810
INSTITUTIONS THAT TO THE BANK OF

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.879
NORTH DAKOTA WORKS WITH REGARD

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:12.514
TO IN THE IN IN THE HANDOUT I

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.382
GAVE YOU IT IT IT SHOWS YOU.

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:16.484
THE LOAN PORTFOLIO THOSE LOANS

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:19.287
ARE DONE THROUGH LOCAL BANKS.

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.623
SO THE BANK NORTH DAKOTA --

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:24.893
DOES PARTICIPATION LOANS AND

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.127
PROVIDES.

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.163
THE A PARTICIPATION APPROACH SO

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:30.231
THE LOCAL BANK PUTS UP SOME

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.933
CAPITAL FOR THE LOAN AND THE

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:32.867
BACK AND WHAT THE COURT ALSO

01:24:32.934 --> 01:24:33.868
PUTS IN CAPITAL AND YOU LOOK.

01:24:33.935 --> 01:24:35.537
THERE'S A THERE'S A DIAGRAM ON

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:36.871
HOW THAT LOAN TRANSACTION WORKS

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.506
SO IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE THE

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:39.674
OPPOSITE OF TRYING TO KILL THE

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:42.377
LOCAL BANKING SECTOR WHAT WE'RE

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:44.012
TRYING TO DO IS BRING IT BACK.

BANKING SECTOR BY BRINGING THESE.

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:49.918

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:51.219
THESE LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS THAT

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:51.853

01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:12.707
WOULD BE DONE IN CONJUNCTION

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.108
WITH THE PUBLIC BANG SAID THAT

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:15.844

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:03.978
IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I JUST

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:05.213
WANT TO SEE IF WE GET A WE HAVE

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:06.014
A THIRD PANEL THAT IS GONNA

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.149
PROBABLY COME UP AS WELL --

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:11.252
BUT I THINK I I I'VE HEARD AT

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:12.687
THE SECOND PANEL REYES IS THAT

01:28:12.754 --> 01:28:13.454
THERE'S TWO CLEARLY DID I MEAN

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:14.055
TWO MODELS THAT ARE DISCUSSED

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.257
HERE BUT MORE MODELS OUTSIDE.

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:18.092
OF THIS HEARING ROOM --

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:20.595
ONE MODEL IS TO ALLOW A

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:23.197
MUNICPALITY ESTABLISH A CHARTER --

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:24.599
AND AND THERE FOR COULD YOU GO

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:25.767
THROUGH THAT PROCESS THE OUT A

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:27.435
OTHER MODEL WE HEARD ABOUT WAS

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:28.703
EXPANDING THE AYE BANK FOR

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:32.040
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS --

I EIGHTH I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:36.310
SO THAT.

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:37.712
AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.147
YOUR MOUTH BUT THERE IS A

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:41.149
FEELING THAT THE TRADITIONAL

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:42.850
BANKS --

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:45.520
PRIVATE BANKS ARE NOT.

01:28:45.586 --> 01:28:47.722
MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:50.091
OR MUNICIPALITIES IS THAT WHAT

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.093
RE HEARING AS THE GENESIS --

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.796
FOR SOME OF THIS.

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:56.831
THERE ARE DISSED YES THERE THERE

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:58.866
ARE UNMET NEEDS CURRENTLY IT FOR

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:01.202
EXAMPLE ONE OF THEM IS PROVIDING

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:02.804
ALTERNATE SERVICES TO PAYDAY

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:04.072
LENDERS.

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:05.106
THAT TO AN UNMET NEED.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.641
BRINGING PEOPLE WERE USING

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.910
PAYDAY LENDERS INTO.

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:11.746
THAT BANKING SYSTEM.

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:14.382
GOTCHA OKAY WELL I JUST SEE THE

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:16.718
I JUST SEE THE COST OF DOING --

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:18.553
EVERYTHING IS VERY HIGH FOR

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:19.987
INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:22.056
TREMENDOUS NEEDS AND WERE

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:24.459
PLACING A LOT OF THE BURDEN ON

IT'S GETTING VERY BURDENSOME I

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:34.836
THINK AND WE CAN DO MUCH MUCH

01:29:34.902 --> 01:29:37.038
MORE AT MUCH LOWER COST IF WE

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:40.074
FINANCE IT DIRECTLY THROUGH THE

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:42.243
EXPANSION OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:44.512

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:46.080
THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:48.015
AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL THROUGH

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:49.484

THIS OPPORTUNITY SPEAK ON

01:31:58.112 --> 01:31:59.380
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:00.314
BANKING HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN A

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:00.982
VARIETY OF FORMS THROUGHOUT THE

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:02.183
STATE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.618
AND WHAT THE PROPONENTS OF

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:04.252
PUBLIC BANK HAVE DISCUSSED THE

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:05.286
VIRTUES THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:06.520
DISCUSSED ABOUT THE COSTS.

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:07.655
AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:08.155
BANKING --

01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:08.756
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS AN

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:10.424
IMPORTANT TIME TO DO THAT --

01:32:10.491 --> 01:32:12.526
IT IN OUR BELIEF THE RISK AND

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:13.494
THE COST DO NOT OUTWEIGH THE

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:14.795
PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF A PUBLIC

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:15.897
BANK OR DOES OUTWEIGH THE PERCY

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:16.964
BENEFIT OF A PUBLIC BANK.

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:17.798
CONSIDERING THE WRIST TO THE

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:19.267
TAXPAYER DOLLARS LET'S --

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.636
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPLY A

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:23.204
ABOUT A PUBLIC BANK BEING ABLE

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:25.039
TO PROVIDE BANKING SERVICES

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:27.074
CHEAPER THAN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:28.509
BUT CONSIDER THAT THE BANKING.

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:30.311
SERVICES INDUSTRY SPENDS TWO

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:31.145
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.947
DOLLARS A YEAR ON COMPLAINTS

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:34.048
COST.

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.716
TEAMS OF ATTORNEYS IN COMPLIANCE

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:36.851
OFFICERS.

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:38.552
ARE DEDICATED TO ENSURING

01:32:38.619 --> 01:32:39.820
COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND

01:32:39.887 --> 01:32:41.055
STATE REGULATIONS.

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:43.024
AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT BY

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:43.624
TWENTY TWENTY TWO THOSE COSTS

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:44.926
WILL DOUBLE.

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:46.294
THE NOTION THAT A PUBLIC BANK

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.496
CAN PERFORM SERVICES CHEAPER IS

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:51.232
A MISINFORMED VIEWPOINT.

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.034
THE TECHNOLOGY ALONE IS A

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.669
SIGNIFICANT HURDLE.

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:57.004
BANKS INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:58.673
IN CYBER SECURITY SYSTEMS THE

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:00.675
EMPLOYEE ADVANCED ALGORITHMS TO

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:02.576
CATCH FRAUD AND PROTECT CUSTOMER

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:03.711
ACCOUNTS.

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:05.513
BANKS HAVE TEAMS OF SECURITY

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:07.815
EXPERTS DEDICATED TO STAYING ONE

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.650
STEP AHEAD OF FRAUD STIRS.

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:11.452
AND THESE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:12.954
SYSTEMS.

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.088
STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:15.656
NECESSARILY HAVE THE BEST TRACK

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:17.758
RECORD IT DEPLOYING TECHNOLOGY

01:33:17.825 --> 01:33:19.293
AND THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.562
NEEDED TO SERVICE CALIFORNIA.

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:24.298
AS A STATE AND EVEN MUNICIPAL

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:24.899
GOVERNMENTS.

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:27.835
IS VERY SIGNIFICANT VERY COSTLY

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:29.537
AND VERY COMPLEX.

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:30.705
THE ADVOCATES BELIEVE THAT

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:32.473
PUBLIC BANKS PUBLIC BANKING

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:34.408
RESULTS IN MORE SOCIALLY

01:33:34.475 --> 01:33:36.344
RESPONSIBLE LENDING --

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:37.411
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:38.913
PROVIDE BANKING ALTERNATIVES

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:40.448
THAT PRIVATE COMMERCIAL BANKS

01:33:40.514 --> 01:33:41.849
WILL NOT --

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:43.384
THEY BELIEVE THAT A PUBLIC BANK

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.052
WILL ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S SOCIAL

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:46.787
GOALS MAKE LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:48.990
WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:50.791
ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES.

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:51.892
IT BANKS ARE ONE OF THE MOST

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.461
HEAVILY REGULATED INDUSTRIES IN

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:54.929
THE UNITED STATES THEY HAVE

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.931
RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.699
NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR

01:33:58.766 --> 01:33:59.600
ACTIVITIES.

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:00.334
A PUBLIC BANK WILL SIMILARLY

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:03.237
HAVE ALL THE REGULATIONS

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:05.172
GOVERNING THE SAFETY AND

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:06.540
SOUNDNESS OF THE INSTITUTION.

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.275
A PUBLIC BANK WITH REGULATORY

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:10.745
STRUCTURE DEPOSIT INSURANCE

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.213
ACCESS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:14.815
WILL HAVE REGULAR EXAMINATIONS.

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:16.083
LIKE A PRIVATE INSTITUTION A

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:17.551
PUBLIC BANK WILL HAVE REGULATORS

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:19.687
ON SITE SCRUTINIZING THE BANK'S

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:20.888
LENDING ACTIVITIES.

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:22.923
THE QUALITY OF ITS LOANS AND THE

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:25.159
RISK TO THE INSTITUTION.

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:26.627
THE BELIEF THAT A PUBLIC BANK

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:28.529
FUNDED BY TAXPAYER DOLLARS CAN

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:30.331
ENGAGE IN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:32.133
THAT A PRIVATE SECTOR BANK

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:33.601
COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T.

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:35.803
IS A FAIRLY UNSOPHISTICATED VIEW

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:36.937
OF BANKING.

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.472
PARTICULARLY IF A PUBLIC BANK

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:39.807
HAS A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:41.308
ENSURING THE SAFETY AND

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.544
SOUNDNESS OF THE INSTITUTION.

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:45.713
FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.314
IN NETTLETON ONLY THE GOAL OF

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:48.816
THIS COMMITTEE IS TO UNDERSTAND

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:50.117
WHAT THOSE PERSPECTIVES ARE

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:51.919
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN INTO ITS

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:53.254
MOST BASIC TERMS.

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.955
YOU'RE TAKING REVENUE TAX PAYER

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:56.590
REVENUE WHICH INCLUDES PENSION

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:58.859
INVESTMENTS YOU'RE MAKING LOANS

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:01.629
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE BASED ON

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:02.863
POLITICAL PRIORITIES.

01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:04.799
AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.367
THERE WILL BE AN ECONOMIC

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:07.401
RECESSION.

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:09.270
PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS AND

01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:10.771
THEY WILL DEFAULT ON THEIR LOANS.

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:11.906
SO THE QUESTION BEFORE THE

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:13.541
LEGISLATURE IS THE DOES THE

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:15.609
STATE WAR DOES THE LOCAL

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:18.045
GOVERNMENT WANT TO PUT ITSELF IN

01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:20.014
THE ROLE OF DEBT COLLECTOR.

01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:21.715
IF THE BANK LOSES MONEY AS IT

01:35:21.782 --> 01:35:23.951
DID IN NORTH DAKOTA FOR TWELVE

01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:25.753
YEARS BEFORE IT MADE MONEY.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.955
WHO BACKSTOPS THAT?

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:30.391
IS IT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:31.892
STATE GOVERNMENT GENERAL FUND.

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:33.094
AND OF SOWHAT HAPPENS TO THE

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.996
LEGISLATURE'S OTHER PRIORITIES.

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:37.431
DOES THE STATE BANK BECOME A

01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:39.834
FACELESS BUREAUCRACY OR IS IT.

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.469
ABLE TO SERVE ITS COMMUNITY AS

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:43.037
WELL AS A COMMUNITY BANK WHICH

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:44.905
IS ALREADY WILL INTO THE FABRIC

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:46.874
OF THE COMMUNITY.

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:47.975
I'D LIKE TO SPEND A MOMENT

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:50.478
TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC MAKE MODELS

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:51.579
THAT MUCH IS BEEN SAID ABOUT

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:54.615
NORTH NORTH DAKOTA AND IT WE

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:55.916
WOULD JUST SAY THAT NORTH DAKOTA

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:58.552
IS HALF THE SIZE OF PHOENIX IT

01:35:58.619 --> 01:36:00.221
IS NOWHERE NEAR.

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:02.089
THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA --

01:36:02.156 --> 01:36:04.892
EAT EGGS IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:05.693
BECAUSE THERE WERE NO OTHER

01:36:05.759 --> 01:36:07.528
BANKS IN NORTH DAKOTA SERVING

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:08.729
YEAH COMMUNITY --

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:11.198
THEY RELIED ON OTHER STATE BANKS --

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:12.666
AND THEY WERE CHARGING VERY HIGH

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:13.901
INTEREST RATES.

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:15.669
BUT THE FACT IS MANY DOUBT THAT

01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:16.937
THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA COULD

01:36:17.004 --> 01:36:18.105
BE FORMED IN THE CURRENT

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:21.642
REGULATORY CLIMATE BECAUSE IN.

01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:22.276
NINETEEN NINETEEN THE REGULATORY

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:24.278
UMBRELLA THE CURRENT BANKS

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:25.980
OPERATE UNDER DID NOT EXIST.

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:27.781
IN AGAIN IT LOST MONEY FOR

01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:28.849
TWELVE YEARS.

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:31.685
IN SPAIN ALL OF THE PUBLIC BANKS

01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:34.822
HAVE BEEN PRIVATIZED SINCE THE

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:36.824
200-072-0008 ECONOMIC CRISIS IN

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:38.359
GERMANY THE REGIONAL AND STATE

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:39.860
BANKS ARE.

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:42.696
FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND THEY ARE --

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:44.198
VERY STATE OF ON PROFIT THE

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:45.866

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:46.433
IN.

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.801
A THING WHICH IS BEEN MADE OF

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:49.136
THE REGIONAL MODEL IN GERMANY

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:50.237
BUT THE REALITY IS THERE NOW

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.906
CHARGING NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:53.674
ON DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND CLOSING

01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:55.242
BRANCHES.

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:57.511

REPRESENTING BOTH THOSE ENTITIES

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:01.542
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO TELL ON

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:03.244
TO WHAT WE'RE JUST DISCUSSING.

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.246
AS A FIDUCIARY A PUBLIC FUNDS MY

01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:07.948
PROTECT THOSE FUND.

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.049
THE TWO MAIN DRIVERS FOR THE

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:10.284
CHARGE ASSOCIATION REGARDING

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:12.186
PUBLIC FUNDS ARE THE SAFETY AND

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:13.687
LIQUIDITY OF THOSE FUNDS.

01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:15.022
THE RETURN OF THE PRINCIPAL IS

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:17.992
MORE IMPORTANT IN THE RETURN ON

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.193
THE PRINCIPLE.

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.362
SO THE FIRST TENANT THERE IS A

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:22.763
SAFETY IS ADDRESSED TO CLARA

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:24.098
BACKSTOPS HIGH CREDIT QUALITY.

WHAT WE'RE ALLOWED TO REINVEST

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:34.408
IN.

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:36.710
THE SECOND TENANT IS LIQUIDITY

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:38.112
TO PUT THAT SIMPLY ITS

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.680
AVAILABILITY TO GET YOUR MONEY

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:42.316
THE REASON WE HAVE BOTH THESE

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:43.684
TENANTS WITH THE BANKRUPTCY OF

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:45.819

OF THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS --

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.458
PERFECTLY LEGAL.

01:38:51.525 --> 01:38:52.693
ALL COUNTIES AND THE STATE OF

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.728
CALIFORNIA HAVE CHANGED WHAT

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:56.330
THEIR GUIDELINES WERE THEREAFTER.

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.999
SENSE THEM ABOUT A DECADE AGO WE

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:00.467
EXPERIENCE THE FINANCIAL GREAT

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:02.069
RECESSION.

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:02.936

WHETHER THOSE STORMS.

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:11.945
BECAUSE OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE THE

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:13.714
CREDIT QUALITY AND THE

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:14.882
COLLATERAL THAT WOULD SUPPORT

01:39:14.948 --> 01:39:16.550
THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR USE.

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:18.319
THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAKE OUR

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:19.787
WITH THE TITLE FUNDS AS THEY ARE

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:21.855
DETERMINED THOSE AREN'T CONVERT

01:39:21.922 --> 01:39:23.557
BUDGETED FUNDS FOR THE LOCAL.

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:29.830
DEPOSIT WITH THE COUNTY

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:32.066
TREASURER'S THOSE FUNDS ARE ON

WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE.

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:37.905
IS THE GREAT PERFORMANCE

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:39.940
RECENTLY BUT HISTORICALLY IN

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:41.942
CALIFORNIA OF NATURAL DISASTERS

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.510
THAT PUTS ANOTHER STRAIN ON TO

01:39:43.577 --> 01:39:44.912
THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE FUNDS

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:47.481
WHEN FUNDS BECOME NECESSARY.

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:49.216
IN GREAT QUANTITIES ON PLANNED

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:51.151
EXPENDITURES DO OCCUR WE NEED TO

01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:21.642
PRODUCTS TRULY SAFE FINANCIAL

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:23.410
ACCOUNTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:25.179
NATIONWIDE.

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:27.147
BUT TRUST ME I KNOW ALL TOO WELL

01:41:27.214 --> 01:41:28.348
THAT SAFE ACCOUNTS ALONE AREN'T

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:29.349
ENOUGH.

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.318
BIG BANKS SOMETIMES CONTINUE TO

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:32.186
DO DAMAGE.

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:33.754
THAT'S WHY IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.456
INCLUDED SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:36.990
BANKING CRITERIA IN THE SAN

01:41:37.057 --> 01:41:38.759
FRANCISCO R. F. P. FOR BANKING

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:39.893
SERVICES.

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.296
WE SPECIFICALLYEXCLUDED BANKS

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:43.864
WHO OFFERED PREDATORY CONSUMER

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:46.266
PRODUCTS LAKE PAYDAY LENDING

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:48.268
THROUGH BANK ATMS.

01:41:48.335 --> 01:41:49.436
I BELIEVE THAT ARE SOCIALLY

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:50.938
RESPONSIBLE BANKING REQUIREMENTS

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:52.139
ARE A MAJOR REASON WHY WELLS

01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:53.707
FARGO DECIDED TO WITHDRAW ITS

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:55.876
PROPOSAL TO HANDLE OUR CITIES

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:57.578
BANKING BUSINESS.

01:41:57.644 --> 01:41:59.513
FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.447
WHEN I WAS THE FIRST ELECTED

01:42:00.514 --> 01:42:01.715
OFFICIALS SPEAK OUT AGAINST

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.116
WELLS FARGO WHEN THEY WERE

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.585
CAUGHT RED HANDED RIPPING OFF

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:07.020
THEIR CUSTOMERS.

01:42:07.087 --> 01:42:08.088
I IMMEDIATELY KICKED WELLS FARGO

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:09.323
OUT OF THE BANK ON SAN FRANCISCO

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:10.958
PROGRAM BECAUSE I NO LONGER HAVE

01:42:11.024 --> 01:42:13.227
CONFIDENCE THAT MY CONSTITUENTS

01:42:13.293 --> 01:42:13.861
COULD TRUST THEM WITH THEIR HARD

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:15.596
EARNED MONEY.

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:17.464
SO I DEEPLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:19.533
WITH MANY IN THIS ROOM WHO ARGUE

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.635
THAT AT TIMES WALL STREET BANKS

01:42:21.702 --> 01:42:22.236
HAVE BEEN BAD FOR CITIES AND

01:42:22.302 --> 01:42:23.103
COUNTIES.

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:25.138
BAD FOR STATES AND BAD FOR ALL

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:28.108
BUT THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS.

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:30.077
YET LIKE YOU I AM BOUND BY THE

01:42:30.143 --> 01:42:31.445
DUTIES AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL

01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:33.547
PER STATE LAW A COUNTY TREASURER

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:36.483
HAS ONE OVERRIDING PRIORITY. TO

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:37.985
ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC FUNDS IN

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:40.087
MY CUSTODY REMAIN SECURE AND

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:41.755
PROTECTED.

01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:43.390
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR A

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:45.726
FUTURE PUBLIC BANK IS ANY LOSS

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:47.160
OF FUNDS WITH A NEED TO RUN THE

01:42:47.227 --> 01:42:48.962
GOVERNMENT.

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:51.431
SO HOW CAN WE AVOID THIS.

01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:52.466
AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD WE SPENT

01:42:52.533 --> 01:42:53.400
MORE THAN A YEAR IN SAN

01:42:53.467 --> 01:42:54.902
FRANCISCOCREATING DETAILED

01:42:54.968 --> 01:42:56.703
OPERATING MODELS FOR MUNICIPAL

01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:58.672
PUBLIC BANKS.

01:42:58.739 --> 01:42:59.740
WELL THERE IS A WEALTH OF

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:01.174
EXISTING REPORTS THAT DETAIL THE

01:43:01.241 --> 01:43:02.276
POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF A

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:04.444
MUNICIPAL BANK AND OUTLINED

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:06.079
REGULATORY HURDLES.

01:43:06.146 --> 01:43:07.014
THERE ARE NONE THAT SHOW HOW

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.715
MUCH OF BANQUET COSTS TO START

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:10.150
AND RUN AND WHAT LINES OF

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:13.620
BUSINESS A BANK SHOULD UNDERTAKE.

01:43:13.687 --> 01:43:14.988
LEVERAGING THE EXPERTISE OF OUR

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:16.823
TASK FORCE WHICH INCLUDED FOLKS

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.625
LIKETIM SCHAFER FROM THE STATE

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:20.193
TREASURER'S OFFICE WHO YOU HEARD

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:21.161
FROM EARLIER.

01:43:21.228 --> 01:43:22.396
SUSHIL JAKE UP FROM THE LAWYERS

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:23.997
COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS WERE

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:25.132
YOU ALSO HEARD FROM.

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:26.333
CAT TAYLOR FROM THE BENEFICIAL

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.068
STATE BANK AND PAULINA GONZALEZ

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.836
FROM THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT

01:43:29.903 --> 01:43:30.671
COALITION.

01:43:30.737 --> 01:43:32.839
WE DOVE HEAD FIRST INTO THORNY

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.575
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO BALANCE

01:43:34.641 --> 01:43:36.176
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY WITH

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:38.679
SOCIAL VALUES AND HOW TO CREATE

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:40.247
AN INSTITUTION THAT BUILDS UP.

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:42.182
RATHER THAN COMPETES WITH OUR

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:43.984
EXCELLENT NETWORKS OF CREDIT

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:47.287
UNIONS CDF ICE AND COMMUNITY

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:48.288
BANKS.

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:50.123
BY PARTNERING WITH EXACTLY THESE

01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:51.792
ORGANIZATIONS A PUBLIC BANK

01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:53.460
COULD PROVIDE COMMUNITY LOANS

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:55.862
ECONOMICALLY AND QUICKLY.

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:57.464
OUR SAN FRANCISCO REPORT WILL BE

01:43:57.531 --> 01:43:59.266
RELEASED LATER THIS MONTH I

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:00.667
PROMISE YOU ALL GET A COPY.

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:02.069
AND IT FAIRLY REFLECTS THE

01:44:02.135 --> 01:44:03.570
DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS OF WHAT A

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:06.273
PUBLIC BANK COULD DO WE HAVE

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:07.374
THREE PRIMARY MODELS.

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:09.209
FIRST.

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:10.310
A LENDING INSTITUTION THAT

01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:12.012
INVESTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:14.481
AND SMALL BUSINESS LOANS.

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:15.849
SECOND A COMMERCIAL BANK THE

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:17.150
TAKES OVER THE CORE BANKING

01:44:17.217 --> 01:44:19.686
SERVICES FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY.

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:22.155
AND THIRD A HYBRID MODEL THAT

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:24.024
DOES BOTH OF THE FIRST.

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:24.925
TO I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:26.159
SURPRISING THE CREATING A BANK

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:27.761
FROM SCRATCH THE CAN SUPPORT THE

01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:29.663
BANKING NEEDS OF AN OVER TEN

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.098
BILLION DOLLARS CITY WHILE

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:32.799
PROVIDING MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:33.367
LOANS.

01:44:33.433 --> 01:44:35.435
IS EXPENSIVE.

01:44:35.502 --> 01:44:36.903
WE'VE HURT WORKED HARD TO

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:38.071
ESTIMATE HOW LARGE A BANK WOULD

01:44:38.138 --> 01:44:39.606
NEED TO BE TO BREAK EVEN AND NOT

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:40.540
LOSE MONEY.

01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:42.142
AND HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE UNDER

01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:43.176
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS TO REACH

01:44:43.243 --> 01:44:45.812
SCALE.

01:44:45.879 --> 01:44:46.847
THE MORE I DIVE INTO THIS WORK

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:47.981
THE MORE I'M CONVINCED THAT

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:49.683
THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS ABOUT

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:52.419
HOW TO FIND A PUBLIC BANK.

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:54.388
AND LIKE LL PUBLIC POLICY

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:55.689
CREATING A PUBLIC BANK

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:57.190
NECESSARILY MEANS MAKING TRADE

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:58.725
OFFS.

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.827
NO JURISDICTION WHETHER AT THE

01:45:00.894 --> 01:45:01.728
LOCAL.

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.563
THE REGIONAL OR THE STATE LEVEL

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:04.765
WOULD BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:06.600
PUBLIC BANKS A PUBLIC BANK WITH

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:08.402
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITHOUT

01:45:08.468 --> 01:45:09.836
TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM OTHER

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:10.804
PRIORITIES.

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:12.539
LIKE GOVERNMENT SERVICES OR

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:14.675
SOCIAL SERVICES.

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:15.842
I COMMEND ALL IN THIS ROOM WHO

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:17.277
ARE DILIGENTLY TRYING TO FIND

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:19.346
CREATIVE WAYS TO REALIZE THIS

01:45:19.413 --> 01:45:21.515
VISIONARY GOAL.

01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:22.683
AT THE SAME TIME LIKE MY

01:45:22.749 --> 01:45:24.117
COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME I

01:45:24.184 --> 01:45:25.485
REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT ANY

01:45:25.552 --> 01:45:26.953
CHANGES TO STATE LAWS.

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:27.788
THAT WOULD WEAKEN THE

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:29.089
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR THE

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:31.858
PUBLIC MONEY WE SAFEGUARD.

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:33.026
CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT DETERMINE

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:34.928
HOW PUBLIC BANKS KEEP OUR MONEY

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:35.729
SAY.

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:37.264
PROTECT US ALL FROM THE RISKY

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:38.765
PRACTICES THE COULD RESULT IN

01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:40.600
THE LOSS OF PUBLIC FUNDS.

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:41.835
OR AS DAN MENTIONED EVEN

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:43.203
DISASTERS LIKE THE ORANGE COUNTY

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:45.672
BANKRUPTCY.

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:47.140
I ALSO WANNA ASK THAT AS THESE

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:49.309
CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE YOU THINK

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:50.644
ABOUT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:51.812
WILL ALLOW A PUBLIC THANK TO

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:53.747
OPERATE AS A SOUND BUSINESS.

01:45:53.814 --> 01:45:55.248
INDEPENDENT FROM POLITICAL

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:57.984
PROCESS AND POLITICAL PRESSURES.

01:45:58.051 --> 01:45:59.486
THEIR MOMS MOST CERTAINLY BE A

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:00.987
CONFLICT BETWEEN FISCAL

01:46:01.054 --> 01:46:04.191
SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIAL GOALS.

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:05.859
THAT'S WHY WE THAT'S WHY WE

01:46:05.926 --> 01:46:07.561
SCENE SOME INTERNATIONALLY

01:46:07.627 --> 01:46:09.229
POLITICAL PRESSURE HAS IMPAIRED

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:10.430
SOMETIMES THE OPERATION OF

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:12.933
PUBLIC BANKS.

01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:14.401
ULTIMATELY BANK GOVERNANCE AND

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:15.936
LEADERSHIP MUST FULLY ACCEPT

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.738
THIS CONFLICT ENSURE THAT A

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:19.072
COMMITMENT TO BOTH SOCIAL GOOD

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.841
AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY IS

01:46:20.907 --> 01:46:23.243
BAKED INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THE

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.443
BANK.

01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:25.412
AND THAT ALL OF STAKEHOLDERS ARE

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:26.580
COMMITTED TO MAKING THE HARD

01:46:26.646 --> 01:46:28.582
DECISIONS NECESSARY TO ENSURE

01:46:28.648 --> 01:46:31.618
THE BANK'S ONGOING VIABILITY.

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:32.919
WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:46:32.986 --> 01:46:34.221
JOURNEY THAT SOMEDAY COULD

01:46:34.287 --> 01:46:36.256
LAUNCH A PUBLIC BANK I'M EXCITED

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:37.591

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:23.750
CONCERN THAT I WOULD HAVE.

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:25.318
WHEN TALKING ABOUT --

01:55:25.385 --> 01:55:27.086
PUBLIC BANKS IN LEVERAGING OF

01:55:27.153 --> 01:55:28.321
THOSE DOLLARS THE MULTIPLIER

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:30.590
EFFECT IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS.

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:31.824
OF THAT IS MENTIONEDTO CREATE

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:34.294
GOOD FOR PUBLIC USING PUBLIC TAX

01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:35.161
DOLLARS.

01:55:35.228 --> 01:55:37.096
AND THAT CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED IT

01:55:37.163 --> 01:55:38.765
SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE COMMUNITY

01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:40.767
PROGRAMS OUT FROM COMMUNITY

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:42.168
BANKS REGIONAL BANKS --

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:44.470
AS WELL BUT HOW MANY TIMES CAN

01:55:44.537 --> 01:55:46.472
THOSE DOLLARS BE LEVERED BEFORE

01:55:46.539 --> 01:55:48.041
I NEED TO GET MY DOLLAR.

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:49.776
BACK WHAT HAPPENS IF I NEED TO

01:55:49.842 --> 01:55:52.312
UNWIND THAT EARLIER THE UNWIND

01:55:52.378 --> 01:55:53.880
ITSELF OF THOSE INVESTMENT

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.415
DOLLARS ULTIMATELY PUBLIC FUNDS

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:57.116

ABOUT A BANKRUPTCY ANY LONGER.

01:56:03.222 --> 01:56:05.491

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:06.959
CRITICAL TO THOSE DOLLARS THE IN

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:08.328
MATURITY.

THEY USE ITSELF IS WHAT WERE

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:11.631
JUDGING THE SAFETY ON BUT THE

01:56:11.698 --> 01:56:13.032
ABILITY TO GET THAT BACK IS

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:15.168
SOMETHING THAT IS EQUALLY

01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:15.968
CRITICAL TO THE TREASURES

THE IDEAS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD.

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:31.117
EIGHT I MEAN WHERE.

01:56:35.922 --> 01:56:37.924
OF THIS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT IS

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:39.192
COMING FROM THE PUBLIC SO

01:56:39.258 --> 01:56:41.160
CLEARLY THERE IS SOMETHING THAT

01:56:41.227 --> 01:56:43.162
HAS NOT WORKED FOR THE PEOPLE OF

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:44.464
CALIFORNIA --

01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:46.199
WITHIN THE MODELS AND PROGRAMS

01:56:57.343 --> 01:56:59.679
THIS POINT SO CAN WE IT.

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:01.247
AS OPPOSED TO ONLY LOOKING AT

01:57:01.314 --> 01:57:02.515
THE RISK IS THERE ANY SELF

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.650
REFLECTION AS TO WHY THIS

01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:07.320
SERVICES AND PRODUCT YOU OFFER

01:57:07.387 --> 01:57:08.588

01:57:20.233 --> 01:57:21.401
COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY I'VE

01:57:21.467 --> 01:57:22.802

MARKET PLACE FAILURES ARE BUT WE

STAND COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.909
THE SUPPORTERS OF A PUBLIC BANK

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:31.711
TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE GAPS ARE.

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:33.146
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION TO BE

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:35.114
SOLUTIONS ORIENTED WE WANT TO

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:37.083
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND IF IT

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:39.051
MAKES SENSE FROM A REGULATORY

01:57:39.118 --> 01:57:40.753
PERSPECTIVE --

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:41.954

AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:57.603
TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:58.805
JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT --

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:03.109
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN

01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:04.710
IMPROVE.

01:58:04.777 --> 01:58:06.879
A WE DON'T THINK.

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:09.682
OF THAT WE HAVE EXIST HAVE IT.

01:58:09.749 --> 01:58:11.818
EXACTLY RIDER EVER EVEN CLOSE TO

01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:13.419
THAT GIVEN THIS.

01:58:13.486 --> 01:58:15.054
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW A INTERN

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:17.056
TO HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:18.157
ABOUT A PUBLIC BANK?

01:58:18.224 --> 01:58:19.392
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S A LOT

01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:21.527
OF WILLINGNESS TO YOU KNOW TO

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:23.396
CHANGE AND TO IMPROVE.

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:26.065
AND I THINK THAT TERM.

01:58:26.132 --> 01:58:28.434
AS A COMMUNITY BANKER WE LIVE

01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:29.635
AND BREATHE.

01:58:29.702 --> 01:58:31.971
THE SUCCESS OF OUR OF OUR FELLOW

01:58:32.038 --> 01:58:34.140
MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY EYES

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:35.708
WEEK AS THEY GO WE GO.

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:36.843
SO IT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:40.112
PERSPECTIVE THAT ZERO IN TERMS

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:42.181
OF THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:58:42.248 --> 01:58:43.716
AND WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING

01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:45.418
THAT'S POSSIBLE WE'VE BEEN UP TO

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:46.986
THE LAST TWO WEEKS I'VE BEEN UP

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:48.721
THE READING TO TALK ABOUT.

01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:50.823
THE THE CAR FIRE IN THE

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:52.725
RESOLUTION THAT THAT WE'RE

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:55.361
TRYING. TO TO IMPROVE THOSE

01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:56.729
COMMUNITIES AND BUILD HOUSING

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:58.698
BEEN UP TO CHICO A TO TALK ABOUT

01:58:58.764 --> 01:58:59.966
THE CAMPFIRE AND ALL OF ITS

01:59:00.032 --> 01:59:01.767
DEVASTATION THAT'S OCCURRED OVER

01:59:01.834 --> 01:59:03.169
THERE.

01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:04.704
WAS OVER IN SANTA ROSA.

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:06.005
LAST -- LAST

01:59:06.072 --> 01:59:08.174
WEEKEND AND DROVE AROUND IN AND

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:09.609
WAS PLEASED TO SEE ALL THE

01:59:09.675 --> 01:59:11.077
BUILDING THAT WAS HAPPENING OVER

01:59:11.143 --> 01:59:12.578
IN SANTA ROSA.

01:59:12.645 --> 01:59:14.113
AND A LOT OF THAT'S BEING DRIVEN

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.615
BY COMMUNITY BANKS AND THEIR

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:16.716
EFFORT AND THEIR CAPITAL AND

01:59:16.782 --> 01:59:19.619
THEIR THEIR THEIR FUNDING --

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:20.920
IN WITHOUT COMMUNITY BANKS ON

01:59:20.987 --> 01:59:22.655
THEN ARGUE THAT YOU KNOW THAT

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:24.390
REBUILD CERTAINLY OF WHAT I'VE

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:27.026
SEEN SO FAR IN IN SANTA ROSA AND

01:59:27.093 --> 01:59:28.294
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING UP IN

01:59:28.361 --> 01:59:30.663
REDDING IN CHICO WOULD BE A VERY

01:59:30.730 --> 01:59:33.599
VERY DIFFICULT TASK.

01:59:33.666 --> 01:59:35.301
THANK YOU I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:38.104
I MEAN THERE AS YOU'VE

01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:40.306
HIGHLIGHTED THERE'S DEFINITELY --

01:59:40.373 --> 01:59:42.508
NOT ALL BANKS ARE THE SAME WE

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:44.110
KNOW THAT AND AND THE CONNECTION

01:59:44.176 --> 01:59:45.778
WITH THE COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT --

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:46.979
ENDS AND SO I DO WANT TO

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:48.881
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I I THINK THAT

01:59:48.948 --> 01:59:50.816
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS

01:59:50.883 --> 01:59:52.785
THAT I HAVE IS.

01:59:52.852 --> 01:59:53.419
YOU KNOW KIND OF THINKING ABOUT

01:59:53.486 --> 01:59:54.020
WHAT.

01:59:54.086 --> 01:59:55.788
SOMETHING WENT WRONG WHEN THE

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:56.289
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:58.124
CALIFORNIA ARE ASKING US TO

01:59:58.190 --> 01:59:59.458
RETHINK OF A MODEL --

01:59:59.525 --> 02:00:01.661
AND SO I WANT TO REFLECT ON THAT.

02:00:01.727 --> 02:00:02.929
AND IT'S ALSO PARTICULARLY

02:00:02.995 --> 02:00:06.132
IMPORTANT FOR ME.

02:00:06.198 --> 02:00:08.901
TO UNDERSTAND OBJECTIVES OF WHAT

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:11.337
IS WHAT THE END GOAL WOULD BE OF

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:12.872
ONE OF THE MANY --

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:14.640
PUBLIC BANK MODELS THAT HAS BEEN

02:00:14.707 --> 02:00:16.042
DISCUSSED AND CERTAINLY THERE'S

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:16.976
OTHERS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:18.844
DISCUSSED HERE TODAY OTHER

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:19.378
MODELS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

02:00:19.445 --> 02:00:20.880
DISCUSSED --

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:23.215
AND HAVING A REAL ANALYSIS ON

02:00:23.282 --> 02:00:25.618
WHETHER THERE ARE ANY REFORMS OR

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:26.953
ANY WORK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

02:00:27.019 --> 02:00:28.254
WITHIN OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE

02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:30.590
THAT WOULD MEET THE OUTCOMES

02:00:30.656 --> 02:00:31.223
THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR OR

02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:32.558
IF.

02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:34.727
A WHOLE NEW BOTTLE IS IS THAT

02:00:34.794 --> 02:00:35.561
THE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO

02:00:35.628 --> 02:00:36.862
THROUGH --

02:00:36.929 --> 02:00:38.364
AND I THINK THAT THIS ENTIRE

02:00:38.431 --> 02:00:40.700
CONVERSATION AT GIVES US MORE TO

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:42.335
THINK ABOUT AT LEAST FOR ME IN

02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:44.203
TERMS OF THAT TYPE OF THE

DIVESTMENT WHICH IS A MAJOR

02:08:58.697 --> 02:08:59.965
REASON --

02:09:00.032 --> 02:09:03.368
FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO

02:09:03.435 --> 02:09:05.237
ENGAGE IN PUBLIC BANKING.

02:09:05.304 --> 02:09:07.906

SYSTEM AND IF WE ALL THINK THAT

02:09:12.478 --> 02:09:15.447
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA --

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:18.417
MR CHOI OF SEEMS TO THINK THAT

02:09:18.484 --> 02:09:19.718
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WAS WILL

02:09:19.785 --> 02:09:21.753
SUBSIDIZE THESE BANKS THAT IS

02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:23.288
NOT THE CASE IN FACT IT'S THE

02:09:23.355 --> 02:09:24.356
OPPOSITE.

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:25.624
WE EXPECT THESE BANKS TO MAKE A

02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:27.459
PROFIT THAT WILL GO BACK INTO

02:09:27.526 --> 02:09:29.228
THE GENERAL FUNDS OF THE

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:32.064
LOCALITIES --

02:09:32.131 --> 02:09:33.232
THEY WILL NOT BE RUN BY

02:09:33.298 --> 02:09:34.967
GOVERNMENTS THEY WILL NOT BE

02:09:35.033 --> 02:09:36.768
UNDER POLITICAL INFLUENCE THEY

02:09:36.835 --> 02:09:38.904
WILL HAVE INDEPENDENT BOARDS.

02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:41.640
OF PRIMARILY COMMUNITY MEMBERS

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:44.309
AND CITIZENS AND BANKERS.

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:46.044
AND WE'RE AWARE THAT THERE'S A

02:09:46.111 --> 02:09:47.045
TENSION.

02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:48.347
BETWEEN FIFTH FISCAL

02:09:52.851 --> 02:09:54.286
ALL OF THE BANKS THAT WE'RE

02:09:54.353 --> 02:09:56.688

DEAL WITH IT IT WILL BE A

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:02.594
PROBLEM IT WILL BE DIFFICULT BUT

02:10:02.661 --> 02:10:04.663
MANAGEABLE.

02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:07.032
A PROFIT IS NOT OUR ONLY GOAL IT

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:09.701
IS NOT OUR BOTTOM LINE --

02:10:09.768 --> 02:10:11.503
AND MR BECKWITH TALKED ABOUT A

02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:13.071
PROGRAM CALLED RISE WHICH I'M

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:14.873
NOT FAMILIAR WITH BUT WHICH

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:17.809
SOUNDS LIKE A MINI EXAMPLE OF

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:21.480
THE KINDS OF COLLABORATION AND

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:23.115

TO INSTITUTE WITH COMMUNITY

02:10:28.887 --> 02:10:31.223
BANKS SO IT IT'S AN EXAMPLE THAT

02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:33.158
WE NEED TO FIND MORE OUT MORE

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.712
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT SUSAN SAID IS

02:10:53.779 --> 02:10:56.215
THAT HAVING A MUNICIPAL BANK AS

02:10:56.281 --> 02:10:57.449
AN ENTITY.

WILL BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE

02:10:59.918 --> 02:11:03.155
CAPITAL FOR THE COMMUNITY BANKS

02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:04.690
THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ON THEIR

02:11:04.756 --> 02:11:06.792
OWN THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

02:11:06.858 --> 02:11:07.192
GIVE.

02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:10.128
MAY BE A LOAN THAT THEY DIDN'T

02:11:10.195 --> 02:11:11.597
HAVE THE MONEY FOR OR THAT'S A

02:11:11.663 --> 02:11:14.099
LITTLE MORE RISKY AND THE REASON

02:11:14.166 --> 02:11:15.500
WE BE ABLE TO DO IT.

02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:18.537
IS BECAUSE WE WILL NOT

02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:20.172
SHAREHOLDERS BECAUSE WE ARE THE

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:22.107

02:11:27.946 --> 02:11:30.082
OF THE CEOS HERE WILL HAVE A CDL

02:11:30.148 --> 02:11:32.718

02:11:32.784 --> 02:11:35.087
THREE HUNDRED TIMES WHAT.

THE AVERAGE BANK WORKER WELL SO

02:11:36.622 --> 02:11:39.191

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:41.326
TYPE OF PROFIT MOTIVE THE PROFIT

02:11:41.393 --> 02:11:43.195
MOTIVE IS TO MAKE PROFIT TO GIVE

02:11:43.262 --> 02:11:44.663

LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS.

COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

02:13:11.817 --> 02:13:13.051
PASSED RESOLUTIONS.

SE -- AND

02:16:10.328 --> 02:16:11.630
CERTAINLY THEY'RE STILL I THINK

02:16:11.696 --> 02:16:13.398
A LOT OF PIECES --

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:15.700
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE RISKS

02:16:15.767 --> 02:16:16.301
TO THE PUBLIC AND WHAT THAT

02:16:16.368 --> 02:16:18.036
LOOKS LIKE AS WELL AS REALLY

02:16:18.103 --> 02:16:19.538
EVALUATING --

02:16:19.604 --> 02:16:21.139

02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:22.607
WHETHER THAT RISK IS A MATTER

02:16:22.674 --> 02:16:24.242
YOU KNOW WORTHY AND IT WHETHER

02:16:24.309 --> 02:16:26.111
