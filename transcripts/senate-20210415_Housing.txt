B. NINE SENATOR ATKINS. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. MISTER CHAIRMAN DAY YOU SO- I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT. THIS BILL AND SO TO YOU AD MY COLLEAGUES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO ON SB NINE. FOR MANY OF YOU THIS BILL WILL LOOK VERY FAMILIAR OR SIMILAR TO A BILL I AUTHORED LAST YEAR S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY. AND I WOULD REMINDED MY COLLEAGUES THAT- THAT BILL SB ELEVEN TWENTY PASSED BOTH HOUSES. BUT DIDN'T GET BACK TO OUR HOUSE LAST YEAR BY THE MIDNIGHT DEADLINE. SO THIS- SB NINE IS VERY SIMILAR TO SB ELEVEN TWENTY. SB NINE PROMOTES NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR A HOMEOWNER TO CREATE A DUPLEX. OR SUBDIVIDE IN EXISTING LOT IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONJECTURE ABOUT HOW MANY UNITS THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SO I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE BILL WOULD ONLY ALLOW UP TO FOUR UNITS ON A SINGLE FAMILY PARCELS AS A RESULT OF THE LOT SPLIT PROVISIONS. IN THIS MEASURE. SB NINE STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL AND CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL SCALE DEVELOPMENT. THAT WE SO BADLY NEED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A SPECIFIC LIST OF QUALIFICATIONS THAT MUST BE MET AND PROTECTS EXISTING TENANTS HISTORIC DISTRICTS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN COASTAL REQUIREMENTS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT SB NINE GUARDS AGAINST SPECULATION AND GENTRIFICATION THE BILL LIMITS INDIVIDUALS FROM RECEIVING MINISTERIAL LOT SPLITS ON ADJACENT PARCELS TO PREVENT INVESTOR SPECULATION. IT'S PROFITEERS FROM EVICTING OR DISPLACING TENANTS BY EXCLUDING PROPERTIES FOR A TENANT HAS RESIDED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS I CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SENATE HOUSING LEAD GROUP TO IMPROVE THE BILL THIS BILL NOW PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE AUTHORITY TO ENACT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. ALONG WITH THE SAFEGUARDS IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR FAMILIES OPTIONS FOR BUILDING MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSING AND ASSETS. INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH IS A CURRENCY WE KNOW IS CRUCIAL TO COMBATING IN EQUITY AND CREATING SOCIAL MOBILITY ESPECIALLY NEIGHBORHOOD HOODS OR OUTDATED ZONING LAWS HAVE CREATED BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP AND LEAD TO OVERCROWDING. THIS BILL GIVES HOMEOWNERS THE OPTIONS TO PROVIDE RENTAL OPPORTUNITIES TO OTHER WORKING FAMILIES WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING TO FIND A HOME IN THEIR PRICE RANGE. OR WHO MAY BE LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN PATH TO MORE AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP. THE BILL IS AN EXPANSION OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE HOMEOWNERS RENTERS AND FAMILIES ALIKE. WE KNOW THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS IS AN ISSUE SO LARGE THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE SOLUTION. AND THAT'S WHY SB NINE AS PART OF THE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL. I WANT TO THANK SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME AND COMMITMENT TO THIS MULTI YEAR PROCESS. MISTER CHAIR WHO HAS AUTHORED KEY PIECES OF LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSING PACKAGE AND WHO OF COURSE HAS LED THE WAY ON SO MANY OTHER. ISSUES RELATED TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AND AFFORDABILITY. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SENATOR CABALLERO I THANK SENATOR CORTESE AND SENATOR MCGUIRE FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. AND WORKING ARE WITH THIS GROUP. I'M PROUD TO OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TOGETHER ON THIS BILL A MULTI YEAR EFFORT AND I AM PROUD OF THE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE AS A WHOLE. TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION POSSIBLE EVEN WHILE WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE NEW REALITIES. AND UNCERTAIN TIMES CALLS BY A PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THIS ISN'T JUST A BILL ARE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE ISN'T JUST A BUNDLE OF LEGISLATION. THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE REAL POSITIVE PROGRESSIVE CHANGES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. TO STRENGTHEN THE FABRIC OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH EQUITY INCLUSIVITY AND AFFORDABILITY. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND THE VALUABLE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES- I BELIEVE WE HAVE- TO LEAD SUPPORTERS NOT A PRO TIME IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. I'M ERIC PHILLIPS FOR NUMERIC PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AND A LEASE- BURKE- SUIT IF I MISPRONOUNCE THAT FROM UNITED WAY OF GREATER LOS ANGELES THE CORRECT GREAT- SO WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM ERIC PHILLIPS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- THANK YOU FOR THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE THIS IS ERIC PHILLIPS AND YOU JUST MENTIONED REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. AND WE ARE PLEASED TO JOIN HIM SENATE PRO TEM ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE TODAY AND THANK HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE AND ALL OF YOU FOR THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING HERE TODAY. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY CONTINUE TO BE AMONG CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRESSING ISSUES ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY CAUSES OF THE HOUSING CRISIS I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS SOME OF WHICH WIENER SAID CREATED PLAY A PART. UNDER CURRENT LAW A MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING. THIS LIMITED HOUSING SUPPLY AND EXCLUDES LOWER INCOME HOUSING HOUSEHOLDS FROM HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND SB NINE CAN BE PART OF THE EFFORT TO EXPAND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL. SB NINE DOES NOT PROHIBIT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OR ZONING IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT IN SUCH AREAS PROPERTY OWNERS MUST ALSO BE ALLOWED TO CREATE SMALL MULTI FAMILY HOUSING OPTIONS. SB NINE CREATES THE BY RIGHT MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE CREATION OF TWO TO FOUR HOMES AND SINGLE FAMILY ZONES IT ALLOWS PARCEL MAPS THE CREATURE STREAMLINED. AND PERMIT UP TO TWO HOMES. FOR A LOT. TO LOG. WITH Q. U. S. EACH THAT THAT. EIGHTY YOU LAWS- UP TO THREE YOU KNOW FROM. OF THIS IS IN IN TO. BUT THE PART MAPS. ALLOW HOMES BE SOLD. WHICH WILL HELP CREE OWNERS OFFER. THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE UNDER OTHER HOUSING PRODUCTION BILLS. AND ALTHOUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS MINISTERIAL THE MAJORITY OF OBJECTIVE PLANNING STANDARDS WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO NEW DEVELOPMENT. EVEN A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THE ADOPTION OF NEW IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. THIS APPROACH HELPS BALANCE THE STATE AND LOCAL INTEREST. SB NINE DEFINES MINIMUM PERFORMANCE TARGETS OF TWO TO FOUR UNITS STATEWIDE. BUT IT LEAVES ROOM FOR LOCAL PLANNERS TO DEFINE AND APPLY CONTEXT SPECIFIC STANDARDS. FINALLY OUR HOPE IS THAT INCREASING HOUSING CHOICE AND SINGLE FAMILY ZONES WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES MORE INCLUSIVE. BUT THIS SHOULD NOT COME AT THE COST OF DESTABILISING EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THIS BILL SAFEGUARDS THAT PREVENT THE LOSS OF EXISTING HOUSING OR THE DISPLACEMENT OF VULNERABLE TENANTS. WE SUPPORT ZONING REFORM TO END THE PRACTICE OF REQUIRING ONLY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ON A MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL LAND. THAT'S WHY WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB NINE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT HERE- LEASE UP WORKS UNITED WAY GREATER LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SO PLEASED TO BE HERE AND EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR SB NINE. WE KNOW THAT LAND USE POLICIES ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE DRIVEN RACIAL SEGREGATION AND WEALTH DISPARITIES FOR DECADES. WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS AN L. A. COUNTY THE AVERAGE BLACK FAMILY HAS ONE NINETIETH OF THE WEALTH AT AN AVERAGE WHITE FAMILY HAS LARGELY DRIVEN THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP. WE KNOW THAT OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS DRIVING OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BEARING THE BURDEN. AND IT MAKES THEM MORE VULNERABLE AT THE SAME FOR THE PANDEMIC. WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT SB NINE WILL HELP TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HOUSING ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED BRACKET BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES. AND HAVE DRIVEN THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN WHITE HOUSEHOLDS AND BLACK AROUND HOUSEHOLDS. WE OFTEN FEEL THAT SB NINE STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL AND CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL BENEFIT THE BROADER COMMUNITY. AND CREATE MORE SPACES FOR OUR WORKERS HAVE HOUSING. SB NINE ONE SOLVE OUR TOTAL HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS ON ITS OWN SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE TO URGE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD ON ALL FRONTS. INCREASING RENTER PROTECTIONS AND INCREASING PUBLIC FUNDS TO SEND- SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FOR PROUD TO BE WORKING ON THE DISHES WITH MANY OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE. UNITED WAY OF GREATER LOS ANGELES STANDS WITH COALITION PARTNERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE WILLING TO REJECT THE STATUS QUO. AND REALLY ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS A STATE SAFE AND STABLE HOME WITH THE ABILITY TO THRIVE. SO IN CLOSING WE DESPERATELY NEED THESE UNITS AND THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK ESPECIALLY SENATE PRETEND TONI ATKINS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MODERATOR WE WILL NOW BRING US THREE NINE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- COLLEAGUES ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON S. B. NINE SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OF FOR A SENATOR. ATKINS IT APPEARS THAT THE OPPOSITION TO. THE BILL MIGHT BE BETTER ADDRESSED WITH SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR AND I'D LIKE TO. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES I CAN SORRY TO HAVE MY BACK TO YOU BUT- IT'S OKAY CIRCUMSTANCES HERE BUT- I'D LIKE TO JUST PULL UP A FEW THESE AMENDMENTS AND SEE IF YOU'RE WORKING ON THEM- ONE IS TO CLARIFY THAT A PROPERTY OWNER SING SB NINE IS LIMITED TO CONSTRUCTING TO RESIDENTIAL UNIFIED THINK THERE'S AN INTERPRETATION THAT. AND WE HEARD THAT WITH THE OPPOSITION AND MANY MORE COULD ACTUALLY BEGIN BE CONSTRUCTED. ON RESIDENTIAL ALL LOTS DEPENDING ON HOW THE SPLIT GOES. UP A LEVEL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REQUIRE ATTIC AT ADEQUATE ACCESS FOR POLICE FIRE AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. THAT IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO ME BECAUSE I WAS VERY MUCH A PART OF. DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY- IN MY EARLY DAYS ON. IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAND TO- AS WE CAME THROUGH THAT PERIOD OF THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT REQUIRED INCLUSIONARY ZONING AND AFFORDABLE UNITS TO BE PART OF A PLANNED COMMUNITY PLANS. IN IN DOING THAT TO THE LOT SIZES FOR THE SINGLE FAMILIES. WERE REDUCED TO- AND THE- HOUSING WAS DEVELOPED ON CUL DE SACS. WITH NO PARKING REQUIREMENT WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I THINK I'VE RAISED ON ALL THE DENSIFICATION OF. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PRESENTED YOU HAVE. PARKING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET OUR SAFETY VEHICLES BE THAT. FOR POLICE FIRE AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY VEHICLES WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF FLOODS. THEY COULDN'T GET DOWN THE STREET. SO IT'S ALWAYS. HEY A RESTRICTED PARKING HONEST IN A YOU HAVE A BUILDING FOR NOW. DUPLEX WHERE YOU ONE PARKING SPACE THIS EVEN A GARAGE IF YOU'VE ENTERED SOME SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES INTO EXISTING COMMUNITIES- THEY'VE ALSO. FOCUSED ON ALLOWING CITIES TO DETERMINE THE RANGE OF LOT SIZES THERE'S UNDEVELOPED LAND. MUCH CONVERSION GOING ON BECAUSE OF THE DOWN. TURN IN THE ECONOMY AND SOME OF THE ROOM THE- COMMERCIAL AREAS ARE NOW BEING CITED FOR- RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BEFORE THIS IS A MANDATE. ON EVERY SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. PROJECT IN IN THEIR CITY IT SAYS- ALSO- WILL THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION CREDIT BEING GIVEN TO THE PRODUCTION OF S. B. NINE UNITS I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IF WE ARE TRYING TO MEET. HOUSING GOALS- ONE ONE FIFTY AN ORANGE COUNTY IS EXECTED TO ALMOST DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THEIR CITY. BASED ON THE READING ALLOCATIONS THAT CAME OUT AS GAY. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE NOT BEING. LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY SHOULD BE BEFORE THIS FINALLY YOU KNOW BILLS FOR A FINAL APPROVAL. I THINK THAT MOST IMPORTANT TO ME AND I MENTIONED IT EVERY TIME AND I'LL. GO BACK TO IT- PROBABLY MISS AND- THE TIME I SPOKE ABOUT SAN. INCOME ARE ESSENTIAL. OF DEPOSED WITH THE GREATEST AGGRAVATION AND I THINK IMPACT TO SAFETY THAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IF YOU SAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL. OR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF I HAVE AS I HAVE. MANY MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BROUGHT TO US BY CONSTITUENTS HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH PEOPLE WHO ABUSE THE PARKING. PARKING PEOPLE'S SPACES THEY PARK IN FRONT OF THEIR DRIVEWAYS AND THEY ALSO PARK MANY THE STREETS LEAD TO OUR SCHOOLS AT THE PARK- AND KIDS ARE MOVING. BACK AND FORTH. OUR STREETS AS WE KNOW NOT ALWAYS FOLLOWING THE CROSSING GUARDS AND- THAT IS RESULTING IN A COUPLE TRAGEDY SO. FAR THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO BE LOOKING AT WHEN WE ARE DOWN TO FIND. IN A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES SO I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK A THAT- AND- WITHOUT. YOU KNOW OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION ABOUT I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT I WILL LEAVE THAT TO YOU. SENATOR ATKINS TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT NUMBER THEM THANK YOU- WE'VE HAD. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES AND HAVE TAKEN. OF COURSE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS- A NUMBER OF THEM IN PARTICULAR. I I'VE TRIED TO BE CLEAR HI IT WAS IN THE PREVIOUS- BILL. SB ELEVEN TWENTY WE HAVE RE CLARIFIED IT WITH AN AMENDMENT IN THIS BILL. WHICH SAYS FOUR UNITS. FOUR UNITS AT. A PARCEL SPLIT. A DUPLEX AND END THE SPLIT. TWO UNITS ON THE OTHER SPLIT. SO FOR WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT FURTHER- IN TERMS OF PARKING AS SOMEONE WHO ALSO COMES OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SPENT. WAY HE- MANY MANY HOURS AT COMMUNITY PLANNING COMMITTEES AND PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND AS A COUNCIL MEMBER- I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF PARKING WE HAVE WE HAVE CERTAINLY WORKED. OUT TO CREATE A BALANCE THERE IS ONE A PARKING UNIT R. ONE PARKING SPACE PER UNIT. SO IF YOU'RE TALKING FOUR UNITS- A DUPLEX THAT YOU KNOW FOUR UNITS TOTAL YOU'VE GOT FOR PARKING SPACES. UNLESS YOU ARE NEAR HIGH TRANSIT AREAS IN WHICH- YOU CAN GET- OUT LESS PARKING BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY. OF TRANSIT- SO THIS- PIECE OF LEGISLATION REALLY FOCUSES ON URBANIZED AREAS TO CREATE- DENSITY TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING PRODUCTION ISSUE- YOU MENTIONED FIRE ACCESS I WOULD SAY. I JUST WANNA POINT OUT THE OTHER ISSUE WHICH IS OUTLINED NOT ONLY IN THE BILL BUT OF COURSE IN THE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. IS HIGH FIRE ZONES- SO THOSE ARE DID THE DEVELOPMENT IS PROHIBITED PROHIBITED AND HI FIRESTONE'S UNLESS A LOCAL JURISDICTION WAYS AND- SO THIS THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS INTENDED. TO BE A PARTNER COLLABORATIVE WITH. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE SO WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT ISSUES- ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE- A CONVERSATION WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS I APPRECIATE EVERYONE THAT SPOKE IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK- AS WE DID LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR- AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD SO I DO APPRECIATE. THE CONTEXT AND THE EXPERIENCE FROM WHICH HE QUESTIONS COM. I THINK AND HOPE I ADDRESSED BY AS MUCH OF THAT AS I COULD. THANK YOU I CENTERS SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR PRO TEM ATKINS FOR HER WORK ON THIS BILL HER WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS THE AMENDMENTS THAT SHE HAS MADE IT NOT ONLY. LAST YEAR- BUT AGAIN NOW THAT IT'S COME BEFORE US THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN. AND THAT SHE USED FOR HER WILLINGNESS TO BRING IT BACK TO US TO ME THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT POLICY. AND I APPRECIATE THE HOUSING COMMITTEES ANALYSIS WHICH GAVE I THINK SOME OF THE REALLY SALIENT POINTS- FOR EXAMPLE INDICATING THAT. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ADD. UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW UNITS JUST BY NEW HOUSING UNITS JUST BY. ALLOWING ADDITIONAL UNITS ON SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND NOW DESTINATION IS NOT BASED ON PUTTING IN YOU KNOW BIG APARTMENT COMPLEXES AT ON THE LOTS OF MULTI FAMILY HOMES BUT RATHER FOR THE TYPE OF VERY MODERATELY DENSE HOUSING THAT THIS BILL IS RECOMMENDING. WE KNOW THAT WE ARE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS AT MINIMUM SHORT IN CALIFORNIA MEETINGS THAT WE HAVE THAT'S HOW MANY UNITS WE NEED TO NOT BE IN THIS HOUSING CRISIS- THE OTHER THING THAT THE ANALYSIS POINTED OUT IS THAT MORE MODERATELY DENSE HOUSING OF THE TYPE THAT WOULD BE PUT FORWARD IN THIS BILL WAS THE NORM IT WAS THE NORM THAT WAS OUR NORMAL HOUSING PATTERN UP UNTIL THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES IT BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN THEN IN THE SEVENTIES TO THE POINT. WHERE SINCE THE SEVENTIES WE HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE. CONSTRUCTION OF THIS SORT. AND IT IS PARTLY THOSE FOR DECADES. THAT ARE WHY WE'RE IN THIS CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN TODAY. NOW ADDITIONALLY I THINK MOST OF US UNDERSTAND MUCH BETTER. WHY WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND HOW ITS ORIGINS REALLY NOT SOMETHING WE CAN GREATLY BE PROUD OF AND I SEE THAT AS THE REPRESENTATIVE BERKELEY MY HOMETOWN. WHERE WE WERE THE FIRST CITY TO REVIEW OR THE VERY VERY FIRST CITY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS TO DEVELOP THIS CONCEPT OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND ARE PLANNING DOCUMENTS ARE CITY'S OWN DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT IT WAS EXPLICITLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RACIAL EXCLUSION. SO WHILE IT MAY NO LONGER BE THAT INTENTIONAL. IT IS STILL THE RESULT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT MAPS ARE SINGLE FAMILY ZONES NOW EQUAL THE SAME. DATE IN TERMS OFDEMOGRAPHICS LOOK JUST LIKE IF WE PUT A REDLINING MAP SO THIS IS ONE WAY TO CORRECT THAT IT MAY NOT BUT AT LEAST IT WOULD ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE. ADDITIONAL THING IT WOULD DO IS THAT WE'RE RIGHT NOW AT THE LOWER LOWEST RATE OWNER OCCUPIED HOME OWNERSHIP CALIFORNIA'S AT SLOWEST RATE SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND OF COURSE OUR HOMEOWNERSHIP WAS GREATLY REDUCED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT IN THE SEARCH IN. SUCH CONSTRUCTION LIKE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE UNITS WOULD BE MORE AFFORDABLE. THAN BRAND NEW UNITS IN BRAND NEW- DEVELOPMENTS EXTERNAL TO AN URBAN AREA THAT NEED WHERE YOU NEED TO BUILD IN THE COST OF ALL NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND LARGE THERE WOULD MOST LIKELY BE FAR LARGER SQUARE FOOTAGE INSECTS. SO IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THIS COULD ALSO EXPAND HOME OWNERSHIP BECAUSE THESE UNITS MAY BE. AT A LOWER PRICE POINT PER SQUARE FOOT THAN SOME OTHER UNITS- I THINK THE LAST THING I WANTED TO RACE IS THE- THEY'RE BOTH SOME OF THE SPEAKERS WHO CALLED BUT ALSO THE ANALYSIS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL. QUALITY COMMITTEES- RESPONSE AROUND THE SEAPORT ISSUE. AND I GIVEN THE MODEST NATURE OF WHAT THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS PROPOSING. I THINK THE MUCH MORE GREATER. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO WAY ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS ARE REFUSAL TO BUILD HOUSING IN ALL THESE YEARS ESPECIALLY OUR REFUSAL TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. IN THOSE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE THE CLOSEST TO THAT ARE THE JOB CENTERS THE HELP DESK SERVICES THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SCHOOLS AND AS A RESULT BECAUSE WE'VE NOT ALLOWED. THE PROPRIOCEPTION OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND HOUSING NOW IS FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM JOB CENTERS WE'VE SEEN ANY CREDIBLE INCREASE IN THE GREENHOUSE GASES FROM TRANSPORTATION AND EVEN WITH OUR COMMITMENT TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IT'S GOING TO BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE ACHIEVE THAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN FARMLAND AND HABITAT HABITAT LAST. IN A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE FAR GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BEEN ADDING A MODEST NUMBER OF UNITS TO EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS- SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE PRO TEM FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. AND I WOULD NOTE THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF- COMMUNITIES MOSTLY IT REFERENCES MINNEAPOLIS BUT WE NOW HAVE A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT ARE BEGINNING TO RE LOOKING QUESTION THEIR OWN SINGLE FAMILY ZONING INCLUDING MY OWN CITY OF BERKELEY WHICH IS RECENTLY PASSED. A RESOLUTION TO REZONING TO ALLOW SOMETHING VERY COMPARABLE TO WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE- ENTITY PROPRIA TIME. I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THIS- OF THIS BILL. WILL TAKE A AS A MOTION A CALLER SENATOR QUESTIONS OR. OKAY SCENE NINE- SO I WANT TO THANK- THE PRO TEM FOR PERSEVERING ON THIS BILL AFTER THE- THERE WAS A BUMP IN THE ROAD AT THE END OF SESSION. LAST YEAR THIS IS A VERY. IMPORTANT BILL- IN- IN HELPING US TO SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S DRAMATIC HOUSING CRISIS. HOUSING SHORTAGE THAT IS PUSHING PEOPLE INTO HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY PUSHING YOUNG FAMILIES AND WORKING FAMILIES OUT. AND THIS WILL BE A GOOD STOP- IN THE DIRECTION SOLVING THE CRISIS- WE KNOW THAT HYPER RESTRICTIVE- WALKED DOWN ZONING- REDUCES ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. IT INCREASES RACIAL SEGREGATION AND IT INCREASES CLIMATE CHANGE BY PUSHING PEOPLE IN THE LONG COMMUTES- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN S. THIS MORNING THERE WAS A GREAT ARTICLE IN USA TODAY. THAT TALKS ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S- HOUSING- PROPOSAL. AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT ZONING REFORM IS THAT IT IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. FIVE IN THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS BODY WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD- A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION THAT DOESN'T SPLIT ALONG PARTY LINES. PRESIDENT BIDEN IS ADVOCATING FOR ZONING REFORM PRESIDENT OBAMA ADVOCATED FOR ZONING REFORM. AND BEFORE I GOT TO AN ELECTION YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ADVOCATING. FOR ZONING REFORM- THIS IS GOOD GOVERNMENT IT'S OVERDUE- AND I AM RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE ON SB NINE- MADAM CONSULTED CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. G. MY APOLOGIES TIME THANK YOU I WILL BE VERY QUICK LOOK I THINK THIS ABOUT HOUSING FOR AND AFFORDABILITY AND NOW MORE AND MORE A DISCUSSION OF LOOKING AT IT THROUGH A AND EQUITY LANDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO WOR THEIR WAY INTO- THE DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP. THIS IS ONE OF THE DIALOGUES OF OUR DAY IT WAS THAT WAY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- THE PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER EXACERBATED ISSUES AROUND THE NEED TO BE HOUSED APPROPRIATELY AND SO THIS REALLY IS A VERY RELEVANT DIALOGUE THAT WE ARE ALL ENGAGED IN AND I WANT TO THANK THE COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. THIS BILL MAY HAVE MY NAME ON IT BUT IT HAS BEEN THE PRODUCT OF NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS- OBVIOUSLY WITH INPUT FROM A NUMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT SIT ON THIS VERY COMMITTEE AND OTHERS- IT COMES OFF OF THE WORK DONE ON SB THIRTY FIVE AS WE LOOK AT HOW TO PROTECT- A CERTAIN AREAS- HIGH FIRE ECCENTRIC IT BUILDS OFF OF THE SUCCESS OF EIGHTY USE. AND THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND THE DATA COLLECTION AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO SEE WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THOSE POLICIES ALREADY WE KNOW THAT CITIES HAVE MOVED FORWARD OF SEATED IN MY VERY NEIGHBORHOOD VERY INCREDIBLE DEVELOPMENT SO THIS IS A VERY MEAGER BILL I KNOW THAT PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE THAT I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL- AND IT COMES FROM THE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN AND CHANGE BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN THE MEANTIME LET ME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME LET ME THANK ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND ASK FOR RESPECTFULLY FOR AN AYE VOTE.

SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO FOCUS ON THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF UNACCOMPANIED.

WAIT AN AVERAGE OF TEN YEARS TO ACCESS STABLE HOUSING IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TRAUMA OR ABUSE. AS THE CAUSE OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS SO WHEN PEOPLE OFTEN ASK WHY DID IN THE VICTIM LEAVE AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS PART OF THE ANSWER.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL BUT THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING I KNOW THE BILL'S COMING JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ONE IS. THAT SIMPLY PROVIDING ONES EMAIL ADDRESS MAY NOT. ALERT THE PERSON PROVIDING THAT EMAIL ADDRESS AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE PROVIDING THAT ADDRESSES THEIR ALSO CONSENTING TO OF FUTURE EMAIL DELIVERY SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE WE WANT TO WORK ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. OTHER ISSUE IS AS WAS ILLUSTRATED THE USE OF AND OF THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED IN THE PROVISIONS TO SAFEGUARD THAT DATA- I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT YOU REMAIN FLEXIBLE TO WORK ON THOSE TWO ISSUES IN PARTICULAR. SO THAT WE CAN- MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE BILL. OF BOTH PROVIDES FOR EFFICIENCY BUT ALSO FOR SECURITY. YOUR NAY I COMMENT MEASURE UP YEAH SURE OR YOU CAN TAKE IT IN YOUR CLOTHES- CAL POLY TO THE CLOSE ANY OTHER- CENTER MICHALSKI. MISTER MISTER I'M GOING TO BE STAYING OFF THE BILL RIGHT NOW I HAVE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS- THAT THE CHAIR JUDICIARY HAS AND I KNOW I'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO VOTE ON IT AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS SO I'M LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE THE MMC BEING TAKEN TODAY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. GREAT SEEING THE- OF CENTER CABALLERO THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM I ALSO SIT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY LOOK AT THIS BILL AGAIN I WILL- OUT OF DIFFERENCE TO THE AUTHOR A. B. IN SUPPORT TODAY BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS I WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S FLEXIBLE ENOUGH FOR THOSE A CHOICE. THAT WERE THERE WHO ARE WERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY TO- I FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS FOR THEM THEY DON'T HAVE TO JUST USE THE EMAIL THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO A WEBPAGE OF IF- IF THEY DON'T WANT TO I HAVE A LOT OF RURAL- HOAS IN MY DISTRICT AND QUITE FRANKLY INTERNET ACCESS IS A JOKE SO TARA REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE A WEB PAGE AND TO REQUIRED THEM. TO ONLY USE EMAIL ADDRESSES IS A PROBLEM BUT AS LONG AS WE CAN OFFER SOME PROTECTION FOR PRIVACY PROTECTION I'M- I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. EIGHT HUNDRED ASSURE COMMITTEE TO SO WE HAVE. GOING TO SING A LOT OF US AGAIN- CENTER- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- AND DO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOTION BY CENTRE GUERRERO- CENTER ARCHULETA YOU MAY CLOSE AND PERHAPS- ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. THANK YOU MR AND IT LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO CALLED IN- TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS- ARE LOOKING VERY MUCH INTO THE AMENDMENTS THAT- CENTER AMBERG HAS BROUGHT UP AND THE CONCERN IS CENTER TO BROUGH AND MENTION. AND THESE AMENDMENTS WILL GO FORWARD AS WE GO TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE- BUT AGAIN THAT REMEMBER WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIFTY UNITS OR MORE FOR INFORMATIONAL WEBSITE WHICH ISN'T EXPENSIVE AT ALL- WHEN WE THINK OF WEBSITES WE THINK IT'S SOMETHING VERY ELABORATE BUT THIS IS JUST AN INFORMATIONAL WEBSITE. THE OTHER THING IS THAT REMEMBER EVERYONE CAN OPT OUT IF THEY WISH NOT TO GIVE THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS. AND THE OTHER THING IS REMEMBER THAT IF THEY VOTE THREE QUARTERS OF THE- OF THE ASSOCIATION VOTE AND NOT TO DO IT AT ALL DID IT WILL APPLY SO FLEXIBILITY IS IN THE BILL. AND BELIEVE ME WE WILL BE WORKING- FOR THE AMENDMENTS TO GO FORWARD AND COME TOGETHER AND I'M SURE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WILL BACKING ON THAT AND IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT. FROM THE SPONSOR IS SHE STILL ON THE LINE WE DON'T NEED HER THEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU FOR THE CLOSE SENATOR- I AM RECOMMENDING- AN I VOTES ON- THIS BILL AND- NOTING THAT WE DID NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY ISSUES.

ISSUES AND SO WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER CABALLERO AND SOME- CONSULTANT IF YOU'LL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS BILL THREE NINETY TWO BY SO ARE ALETTA THE MOTION DO PAY. BUT FIRST BE RIVER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY SENATOR WIENER AYE WIENER AYE BATES HI BATES HI CABALLERO I CABALLERO- CORTESE. MCGUIRE OCTOBER SKINNER HI SKINNER NUMBER NUMBER FIVE CASKEY.

THAT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON SB SIX TWENTY ONE WE HAVE THE AMENDMENTS READY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS HOWEVER BECAUSE THE TIMING ISSUES THEY WILL BE PROCESSED THROUGH THE NEXT COMMITTEE. IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY. A QUICKLY THOSE AMENDMENTS WOULD EXTEND THE VACANCY PERIOD REQUIREMENT A BILL FROM SIX MONTHS TO ONE YEAR. AND STATE THE INTENT TO ALLOW A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PURCHASE PROPERTIES. THE PROJECT COUNTY. THE BILL CREATES EXPEDITED PATHWAY FOR PROJECT DEVELOPERS TO TURN ON INHABITED MOTELS AND HOTELS AND A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. TRANSITION HOTELS AND MOTELS. HAVE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES AS WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY IN CITIES WHERE IT'S OF THE SIDEWALKSARE IN THE STREETS OR IN. AS OFTEN ALREADY PARKING. IN OTHER WORDS ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HUMAN HABITATION IS ALREADY IN PLACE AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO RURAL REPRESENT PARTS OF RURAL CALIFORNIA WHERE. THE AT THE IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO GO BUILT ON GREENFIELD THIS IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO BUILD IN CITIES WHERE THESE ARE ALREADY EXIST. IT REDUCES THE IMPACT ON WATER QUALITY AND SEE WHICH- THE BILL WILL ONLY APPLY TO HOTELS AND MOTELS THAT ARE NO LONGER IN OPERATION THEY DON'T THE TWO DID NOT PROVIDE SHELTER AND WILL NOT BE DISLOCATING EVERYBODY IS OFTEN A CONCERN. THIS EXPEDITED PROCESS WILL NOT ONLY CREATES MORE MARKET RATE HOUSING. BUT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN EXPEDITED MINISTERIAL PROCESS. WOULD MAKE PRIVATE PROJECTS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO INCREASING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. PRESIDENT OF THE DEVELOPERS USING THE CURRENT PROCESS THE PURCHASING INTERNEES HOTELS AND MOTELS INTO HOUSING THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY AFFORDABLE. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE 10% OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SET ASIDE. IT ALSO MAKES CLEAR. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE GREATER AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENT. WOULD APPLY IN ITS PLACE OF THIS TEN PERCENT. I KNOW HOUSING PRODUCTION HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND COURSE THIS CHAIR AND PARTICULAR AND WE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THEM ON THESE BILLS ALREADY TODAY. I THINK THIS BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN KEEPING PEOPLE ON HOTELS HOUSED PROVIDING A PATH FOR QUICK. HOUSING PRODUCTION ENSURING THAT THE SUCCESS THE PROJECT COUNTY REMAINS UNHINDERED.

PATHWAY FOR THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROCESS- IT WOULD BE FOR KOBE AND IT WOULD BE FOR- THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH- PROJECT HOME KEY. AS A SENATOR EGGMAN INDICATED THE INTENT IS TO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT- HOME KEY. BUT TO ADD TO THE SUCCESS OF THAT PROGRAM- WE OBVIOUSLY ALSO INTENDED TO PROVIDE- AN EXISTING SOURCE OF HOUSING- THROUGH. HOTELS AND MOTELS THAT HAD NOT BEEN UTILIZED IN THE RECENT PAST.

THIS HAS RESULTED IN A RAMPANT HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THE RACIAL SEGREGATION IN OVERCROWDING OF HOMES AND LOWER INCOME BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES BEING PUSHED OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES AT AN ALARMING RATE. HOUSEHOLDS IN L. A. COUNTY ARE SPENDING MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING COMPARED TO JUST 3% OF MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY FURTHER EXACERBATED THE HOUSING CRISIS PARTICULARLY FOR BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES AND IT HAS MADE EVEN CLEARER WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW TO BE TRUE. THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BEING FORCED TO MAKE UNTENABLE CHOICES IN WHERE AND HOW THEY LIVE. WE ARE CLEARLY NOT DOING ENOUGH TO PRESERVE AND CREATE HOES FOR WORKING CLASS AND LOWER INCOME PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY. THE HOUSING CRISIS IS REGIONAL IN NATURE. IN FAR TOO GREAT TO BE ADDRESSED INDIVIDUALLY BY THE COUNTY'S EIGHTY EIGHT INCORPORATED CITIES. SO ORIGINAL CHALLENGE REQUIRES A REGIONAL SOLUTION. SB SIX SEVEN NINE OFFERS A WAY FORWARD FOR A UNIFIED COORDINATED COUNTY WIDE APPROACH. TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHILE ALSO PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF ALL RENTERS IN EVERY JURISDICTION. SB SIX SEVEN NINE WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF ACTIVISTS ORGANIZER'S UNIONS AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS WILL CREATE A HOLISTIC COUNTY WIDE APPROACH. TO SUPPORTING RENTERS PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CREATING NEW HOUSING FOR WORKING IN LOW INCOME PEOPLE AT A MUCH LARGER SCALE. IT IS ALSO AN L. A. COUNTY DELEGATION HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY THIS YEAR. THIS BILL WILL CREATE A NEW INDEPENDENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS AGENCY FOR L. A. COUNTY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE OUR DEDICATED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT CREATION OF NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RENTER PROTECTION AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE NEW AGENCY TO GENERATE LOCAL TAX REVENUE BY PLACING A MEASURE ON THE COUNTY WIDE BALLOT FOR A PARCEL TAX GROSS RECEIPTS BUSINESS LICENSE BUSINESSES. FOR A DOCUMENTARY TRANSFER TAX. THIS BILL ALSO ELEVATES NON TAX STRATEGIES LIKE ISSUING BONDS IN BRINGING IN PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR. AT LEAST 50% OF THE REVENUES GENERATED MUST BE SPENT ON NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND OWNERSHIP FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WHICH IS DEFINED AS EARNING LESS THAN 80% OF AREA MEDIA INCOME WITH ADDITIONAL SET ASIDES. FOR VERY LOW INCOME AND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS 3240% MUST BE ALLOCATED FOR IN A PROTECTION AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS LIKE A COUNTY WIDE RIGHT TO COUNSEL AND NO MORE THAN 10% CAN BE SPENT ON ADMIN AND OPERATIONS. I THINK THIS BILL MEETS THE MOMENT. AND BILLS ON THE GOOD AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. AND OFFERS A WAY FORWARD FOR L. A. COUNTY AT A SCALE WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED. WITH ME AND SUPPORT OUR ELISE BUKE CEO OF THE UNITED WAY OF GREATER LA. SHE'S THE PRESIDENT. AT SPONSOR ORGANIZATION OF THIS BILL AND JOSIE CLAIRE FOND OF TRUST SOUTH LA. THANK YOU SENATOR OKAY WE WILL NOW GO TO OUR LEAD SUPPORTERS WHO EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES- POLICE PUKE AND THEN- JOSIE OUR CAR FUND. MISTER FIFTY WOULD BE MINDFUL OF YOUR TWO MINUTES SO THAT YOU DON'T- TAKE TIME AWAY. FROM JERSEY CAR FUNDS SO. ABSOLUTELY ADD THANK YOU SO MUCH- WE ARE SO PROUD TO BE SPONSORING SB SIX SEVENTY NINE. WHICH WE FEEL IS AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO BRING COORDINATION EFFICIENCY AND FOCUS OUR HOUSING EFFORTS IN L. A. COUNTY. EVEN AS WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LEAVING HOMELESSNESS AND L. A. COUNTY ARE HOMELESSNESS IS NEVER THE LESS INCREASE. AND WE KNOW WHY WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT RENTERS TO PRESERVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE HAVE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'RE NOT CREATING NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OVER THE LAST DECADE WE HAVE LOST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS THAT RENT FOR LESS THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IF EVER THERE WAS A CRISIS THIS IS IT. WE FEEL THAT SB SIX SEVENTY NINE BRINGS WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED WHICH IS A REGIONAL APPROACH WE CANNOT CONTINUE THE PATCHWORK AND FRAGMENTED APPROACH WE HAVE HERE IN THE COUNTY AND OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK THAT BRINGS THE MANY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TOGETHER. TO FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGE WITH THE RESOURCES- TENSIONS THAT IT A MAN. WHO WERE DEEPLY PROUD TO BE STANDING WITH ORGANIZATIONS YEAR SUPPORTING THIS BILL FROM LABOUR PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDERS DEVELOPERS AND JUSTICE ADVOCATE. TO YOU ALL AGREE THAT THIS IS A SYSTEMIC CHANGE WE NEED I WANT TO THANK SENATOR COM LONGER FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND URGENCY RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND WE ARE COMMITTED AT UNITED WAY TO DOING OUR PART TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS- IN THE UPCOMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE ARE NOT HERE FOR JERSEY CHOSE CLOUGH FUND- FROM TRUSTS SOUTH LA. SENATOR IS MY NAME IS JESSE CLEAR FIND AND THE COALITION IS AN EXTERNAL RELATIONS MANAGER WENT. AWAY OUR ORGANIZATION IS PROUD TO BE PART OF THE COALITION THAT ACCORDING SB SIX SEVENTY NINE. BY THE WAY IS A COMMUNITY BASED EFFORT THAT WORKS AT THE WHITE THE NEIGHBORHOOD OUT THE DOWNTOWN LA. INCREASED PROPERTY VALUES AND RENTS HAVE PUSHED OUT MANY LONG TERM RESIDENTS. OUR MISSION IS A THIRD OF THE ELECTORATE COMMUNITY CONTROLLED LAND. WE WORK WITH SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTY AND ARE COMMITTED TO THE LIBERATION OF BLACK AND BROWN ANGELINA'S FROM THE HISTORICAL FACTS AND RACIALIZED REDLINING AND DISINVESTMENT. I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW MUCH PUBLIC ITS INVESTMENT HAD HURT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. NOT ONLY HAD WE NOT INVESTED ENOUGH IN CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN L. A. COUNTY OR CREATING ANY COUNTY WIDE APPROACH. WE ALSO HAVE NOT CREATED BURDENS OF MONEY THAT ARE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE LESIONS LIKE FRANCHISE. AND THE WORK WE DO TO ACQUIRE AND PROTECTED HOUSING. THE ANSWER TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS ARE NOT JUST TRADITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING WE MUST SUPPORT CREATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP WHICH PRVENTS LOW INCOME HOUSING FROM ENTERING THE SPECULATIVE REAL ESTATE MARKET. ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY TRAUMATIZED. AND DISPLACED DURING THE PANDEMIC. CHECK OUT THE LATEST AND JOHN REPORT OF B. SEVENTY. BECAUSE IT BRING COUNTY. FOCUSED THE PRO TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST BY AND I'M- IT WOULD BRING THE- DEDICATED RESOURCES THAT WE NEED FOR OUR PEOPLE TO DRIVE.

YEAH THE UNION ONLY A LANGUAGE AND- YOU KNOW UNLESS REASONABLE GUARDRAILS ARE PUT IN PLACE TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE COSTS INCREASES THIS LANGUAGE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERMINE THE BILL'S INTENT WHICH IS TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU. TO REVIEW COULD GO OUTSIDE AND WORK THIS OUT SO WE CAN HAVE A GROUNDS. RESOLUTION CENTER CALLER WELCOME THE HOUSING.

AND WITH THOSE TRIALS MISTER CHAIRMAN NO RESPONSE HE WAS EMPTY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- YES. SOME TO THINKING. VETERANS BOTH I'M SORRY SENATOR TELEGRAM THINKING RIGHT NOW. WITH REGARDS TO YOUR- TO YOUR BILL I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS DO WE ALREADY HAVE IN MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS ANOTHER OVERSIGHT OR ANOTHER LEVEL OF. GOVERNMENT AND OVERSEEING THE- THE ISSUES AT HAND WITH HOUSING IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IN ONE OF OUR VERY FIRST COMMITTEE AT ON HEARINGS ON I BELIEVE IT WAS HOMELESSNESS OR HOUSING I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HOMELESS AS THEY DISCUSS THE AND WIDE ARRAY OF ORGANIZATIONS IN DEALING WITH AT. THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. AND- THE LACK CAN. THAT NOT EVERYBODY KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT EVERYBODY'S DOING SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO WHY DID YOU FEEL COMPELLED TO CREATE ANOTHER YET ANOTHER AGENCY TO OVERSEE- THIS ISSUE- DO YOU BECAUSE I THINK- SENATOR YOU ALMOST ANSWERED THE QUESTION WITH A QUESTION. THE REALITY IS THAT NOT EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING WE IN L. A. COUNTY WE HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES WE ALSO HAVE THE LARGE A CITY THAT IS LOS ANGELES AND WE HAVE THE COUNTY. AND TO BE QUITE HONEST EVERYONE IS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE- OR A LAKE CITY WE HAVE LOST SO WHICH FOCUSES ON HOMELESSNESS BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THIS HOUSING AUTHORITY. THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO AND SO THIS ISN'T CREATING ANY OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT BUT IT IS CREATING AN AGENCY TO HELP COORDINATE THE DESPERATE EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON IN OUR COUNTY. AS IT RELATES TO HOW WE'RE ABLE TO ACCELERATE PRODUCTION HOUSING PRESERVATION AND SUPPORTING RENTERS- WE NEED AN ENTITY THAT CAN CONVENE- ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. WE NEED AN ENTITY THAT CAN STREAMLINE ALL OF THE PROCESSES THAT ARE IN PLACE- AND WE NEED TO BE MORE TETHERED TO ONE ANOTHER AS IT RELATES TO FINDING THE SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN HAVING EIGHTY EIGHT DIFFERENT- RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES THAT ALL OF US ARE FACING AS IT RELATES TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS SO. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE- THAT KIND OF TETHERING AND MORE COORDINATED AND STREAMLINING APPROACH SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY YOU'RE SAYING IS THIS IS THIS WOULD BE THE OVERSIGHT. AGENCY THAT SEASON EVERYBODY ELSE AND PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER WELL I ALSO WANT TO INVITE AT. LEAST TO- HELP. RESPOND BECAUSE I TO MAKE THAT YOUR- GETTING THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT THIS AGENCY WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TELL THE CITY'S WHAT TO DO- BUT AS IT RELATES TO PROCESS SEES AS IT RELATES TO MAYBE HOW TO MAKE POLICIES MORE EFFICIENT AS IT RELATES TO TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE RAISE MORE REVENUE. AS IT RELATES TO HAVING A COORDINATED RESPONSE TO RENTER PROTECTIONS AND THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL THIS WOULD BE AN AGENCY THAT WOULD ABLE BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW HOW THE- THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THOSE ISSUES OR- THE OPERATIONAL POLICIES FOR A LOT OF THOSE CHALLENGES- I DON'T KNOW IF THE LEASE IS STILL ON THE LINE AND MAYBE SHE WANTS TO ADD. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO OPERATE THE COMMON. YES THANK YOU- YOU KNOW I WILL TELL YU WE ARE IN ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW WITH- MANY COUNTY AND LOCAL CITY GOVERNMENT AND THEY'RE- VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY AND I THINK CENTER CALL MUNGER REALLY SPELLED IT OUT. WHILE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS. ON THE HOMELESS HOUSING. REALLY ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SIDE AND- TO REALLY NOT THE WAY TO THE ISLAND AND OURSELF BUT LOOK AT A REGIONAL APPROACH OUT OF THE- EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES WE HAVE LESS THAN TEN ARE REALLY FOCUSING LOCAL REVENUE ON THESE- RENTER PROTECTION AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CREATION. AND THEY ARE READY TO GO AND SO THIS VEHICLE REALLY WILL ALLOW THEM TO COME TOGETHER WE CAN STRATEGICALLY AND THEN UP TOP AWAY ACCESS ANY PUBLIC REVENUES AND ALSO PRIVATE REVENUE LIKE BALL AND- TO- I THINK IT'S REALLY FEELING FILLING A GAP THAT IT THAT IT FEELS LIKE LABOR OR COMMUNITY GROUPS BUSINESSES AND. GOVERNMENT ARE ASKING FOR RIGHT NOW. THREE IN ORDER WHAT'S I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION- WITH REGARDS TO THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD AT THE PREVIOUS WITNESS- WITH IS THIS. HOW DOES THE- FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT- WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CONSTRUCTION IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING ANYTHING THAT WE ARE PAYING A DIGNIFIED WAGE IN THAT WE ARE PROTECTING THOSE THAT ARE DOING THE HARD WORK OF CONSTRUCTING HOUSING. AND I THINK I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE'S A LARGE COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE EITHER UNIT USING. UNION LABOR WORKING WITH PLA'S. ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO- ADD MORE UNITS- TO BUILD HOMES THAT PEOPLE. WHO BUILD THEM CAN ALSO AFFORD TO LIVE IN- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- CHURNING EIGHT A VERY PRODUCTIVE- YOU KNOW ECONOMIC RECOVERY AS IT RELATES TO JOBS. OKAY SO THIS WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO ONLY. UNION IT PROJECT UNION LABOR CONTRACTS IS THAT WELL SO I WILL SAY THAT- MOST AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENTERED INTO- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY- EITHER ARE DONE WITH- LABOR SUPPORT- EITHER USING UNION LABOR OR SPECIFYING LPLA AGREEMENTS AND THIS WOULDN'T BE ANY DIFFERENT. FIVE IT IS CLEAR FROM THAT THE BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE UNION IT REQUIRES A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE AT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE- OF THE WORKERS COME OUT OF- THE SKILLED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- AND I WILL OFTEN BE IN A UNION SHOP. BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE SO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT. SO EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO BE A DENTIST JOBS AND WORK AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. IS THAT CORRECT YES. OKAY THE IDEA IS TRYING TO AND WE WANT TO HAVE. THE IDEAS IS TO HAVE SKILLED APPRENTICES- THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE YEAR THE HIGHEST CALIBER COMMUNITIES APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS- AND TO HAVE. YOU KNOW AND. NOT HAVE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS LIVING IN POVERTY. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BID ON THE SHOPS- I JUST JUST. VETERANS. I WILL ADD THAT THE I WAS ALREADY THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE AUTHORITY IS TO GET A HARNESS- REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESSES BY WHICH THE CITIES ARE LOOKING TO- A CONSTRUCT THEM AND ALSO TO SUPPORT RENTERS IT THE AGENCY WILL NOT BE IN THE BUSINESS OF ACTUALLY YOU KNOW BUILDING- HOMES OR UNITS ITSELF- BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT. THE TRUSTS AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED THAT WOULD BE DOING SO I ALSO WANT TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION TO THIS IS IN A CONSTRUCTION AGENCY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NINE- I AM RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE ON WAS GOING TO FIND. OUT OF THE AUTHOR- AND HER SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE- TO BUILD OUT THE USES OF. THE FUNDS WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN AMENDED INTO THE BILL ALSO THANK YOU FOR THAT I WANT TO SAY A FEW YEARS AGO- WE- AND- THE BAY AREA LA WE WILL OF FRIENDLY RIVALRY BUT IT'S A LOVING- FROM THE RIVALRY AND- WE LEARN FROM EACH OTHER SO LA A FEW YEARS AGO. MASSIVE TRANSPORTATION MEASURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO NOW DO IN THE BAY AREA TWO YEARS AGO WE IN THE BAY AREA PASS WE WILL PASS LEGISLATION HERE TO AUTHORIZE THIS KIND OF MODEL. FOR THE BAY AREA AND IT'S TERRIFIC THAT LA IS NOW MOVING FORWARD. ON THE GOVERNANCE ASPECTS WILL BE DEALT WITH IN THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE- COMMITTEE IT'S MORE COMPLICATED FOR LA. AND THE BAY AREA IN THE BAY AREA WE WERE ARE CONTIGUOUS WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF THEIR GOVERNMENTS IN THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. SO WE HAD AN EXISTING GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE BECAUSE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS OF GOVERNMENT IS NUMEROUS COUNTIES NOT JUST L. A. COUNTY ON A SEPARATE STRUCTURE WILL HAVE TO BE CREATED- TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE. DIVERSE REPRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY- AND STRONG LEGAL STRUCTURE- TO IT SO THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A SEPARATE ENTITY AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WORKING. WITH SENATOR MCGUIRE AND HIS- TALENTED STAFF WILL BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH. THOSE ISSUES- SO I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL- AND WITHOUT CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE. SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR YOU SAID MUCH OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IN MY CLOTHES I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THERE ARE ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL LEVELS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS BILL- HAPPENING IN REAL TIME. AND THE GOAL IS TO HAVE- ALL OF THE ISSUES RESULT AS A REAL TO THE- STRUCTURE OF THE BEEF. OUR DEADLINEWITH THE AND HAVE BEEN IN. TALKS WITH THE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT ON TO YOUR POINT- WE ARE LEARNED FROM THE OBSTACLES THAT WERE FACED WITH AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN- IN THE BAY AREA- AS WE ARE WORKING THROUGH SB SIX SEVEN NINE. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL- FOR WHAT THE BAY AREA WAS ABLE TO STEP FORWARD AND DO. TO MAKE THEIR HOUSING AUTHORITY A REALITY- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE- AND I'VE GOT THAT'S THE RIVER MOTION ON THIS BILL. CENTER CORTEZ HE OKAY MADAM CONTROL CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THIS ISSUE FORWARD THIS YEAR- DID. THIS THIS MAN IS WAS IT. INTENDED TO BE A VERY NARROW FIX OF OUR UNDERLYING- ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT LAWS. TO ENSURE THAT- WHILE WORKING IN SMALLER. PROPERTIES ARE STILL ABLE TO PURSUE BOTH JUNIOR EIGHTY YOU SAY THE GARAGE. FOR A BACKYARD EAGLES THEY HAVE SPACE AND TWO THOUSAND AND AMEND ALL TO THOSE KINDOF OPPORTUNITIES. IN MY DISTRICT IN OUR DISTRICT STATE. SEN LARGER CLIENTS. WORLD MORE SUBURBAN AREAS. WE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT PUT FORWARD MEASURE YOU TRY DOING GOOD BEHAVIOR SO- EVERYONE CAN REALLY EMBRACE THE- THIS GROWTH IN IT HE AROUND STATE AND I THINK IS REALLY CREW TO BE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE NUMBER. COST EFFECTIVE MAY- SO THE BILL WILL BE GIVE SOME SLACK- TO GOVERNMENTS LOOK AT SET- IN CASE. WHERE ARE TO PUT- THAT NEWLY YOU- RIGHT DO THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY MAY HAVE A BETTER IT THEY'RE JUST- NOT SO A LA. THAT DOES THE USING WE BE THIS IS- STOPPED. OR LIMITED IN ANY WAY BUT TRYING TO SAY THEN IS- IT IS NAY. AND IS- CONFORMING OF A MAN IS I THINK WOULD WOULD DO BE. FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION- INTO PREVENTIVE ENTITY QUAN CONCERT FROM AND OF BILLS HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED YEARS- AS A MEMBER FRIEDMAN ACTUALLY BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO ME WHO'D BEEN CARRYING A SIMILAR LEGISLATION I DELETED YOU PRODUCTION BUT IT'S SEEN IN IN HER COMMUNITY- SOME OF THESE ISSUES ALREADY STARTING TO POP UP- SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO SAY FOR THE RECORD AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE WANT TO SLOW DOWN HERE- AND TAKE SOME TIME IS THAT. FOR SMALLER LOTS WE RECOGNIZE THE BILL DOESN'T REALLY DISTINGUISH MEANS SMALL AND LARGER LOTS AND WE DID NOT- NEEDS TO BE SEEN AS SOME SIGNAL- TO. STOP EVERY FOR PUTTING A THEIR BACKYARDS- MORE VERY. TO AMENDMENTS OR J. TO DISLODGE- OVER THE NEXT. YOU KNOW OVER THE COURSE OF THIS TWO YEAR SESSION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO CITY LIMIT THE APPLICATION OF THIS BILL TO LARGER LOT SIZES- IF YOU HAVE A HALF ACRE OR AN ACRE OF PROPERTY. AND YOU'RE PUTTING ANY TO YOU RIGHT UP AGAINST THE FENCE LINE- AND SAY- YOU KNOW- IMPEDING. YOUR NEIGHBORS ENJOYMENT OF THEIR PROPERTY- THERE'S THERE ARE TO BE A BETTER OPTION THAN THAT SO- THAT'S SORT OF WHERE WE'RE HOPING WE CAN LAND THIS- BUT I RECOGNIZE THIS IS. A SENSITIVE ISSUE AND HE'S GOING TO TAKE SOME ON MORE CONSIDERED NEGOTIATING SO- THAT'S WHY WE'RE STILL IN THE MEASURE DOWN TODAY BUT I DO APPRECIATE- THE ENGAGEMENT FROM A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS A- HOUSING PROPONENTS OUT THERE I THINK WE'VE GOT. A LEGAL CITIES AND- A NUMBER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN SUPPORT HERE BUT- BUT WE DO NOT INTENDED TRY TO GIVE A STATE FARM OR IN ANY WAY ROLLOVER. FOLKS WHO WANT TO SAY YES IN THEIR BACKYARDS BECAUSE I AGREE WE SHOULD BE SAYING YES IT'S JUST A WE'RE IN THAT BACKYARD ARE WE SAYING YES AND IF YOU PICK THE BEST SPOT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR OVERALL HOUSING PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA SO.

OKAY THE I'M RECOMMENDING THAT WE PASSED THE BILL AND I CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE OR- RESPOND CENTER MY COUNTY WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE A CONVERSATION I'M I THINK IT'S A IT'S A VERY INNOVATIVE AND INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE SPONSORS OF WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE NONCONFORMING USES- ON ON PARTICULAR PROPERTIES WHETHER IT'S BEE A GARAGE CONVERSION OR- A SHED THAT'S BEEN CONVERTED.

BOATS TODAY. THANK YOU SO COVERAGE- IS OUR MOTION. SENATOR CHRIS HAS HE MOVED- AND OUT OF HIS OWN WILL YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL FOUR NINETY BY SENATOR CAFIERO THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR WIENER ALL RIGHT WIENER I'D BATES. CABALLERO HI COPYRIGHT CORTESE. CORTESE I'M OF WIRE. WHICH- ABOVE HI RICHARD BERG SKINNER HI SKINNER HI I'M BURKE. NUMBER WOOD COUNTY HI BECAUSE I. SEVEN IT HAS ENOUGH VOTES PUT ON FOR A AND NUMBER. A BEFORE WE HAD TO OUR NEXT SORT OF SERGEANTS TO JUST IMPORTANCE REQUIRE THAT WERE ON OUR LAST BILLS. OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUR FINAL BILL TODAY S. B. ITEM NINE SB SIX FORTY NINE BY SENATOR CORTEZ ANY- CENTER YOU MAY PRESENT THE BILL. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS SENT TODAY I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB SIX FORTY NINE. THE BILL THAT ALIGNS TENANT PREFERENCES WITH INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REQUIREMENTS. TO ALLOW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT USE TAX CREDIT OR BOND FINANCING. TO REDUCE DISPLACEMENT. BY USING TENET PREFERENCES. COVERT NINETEEN. AMONG OTHER ISSUES HAS AMPLIFIED THE DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BY CALIFORNIA'S. MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THROUGH REDUCE INCOMES ARE RISING HOUSING COSTS. THE BECAUSE LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY PEOPLE OF COLOR REAL TANGIBLE ISSUES INCLUDING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND EDUCATIONAL DEFICIENCIES TO NAME A FEW. DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES ALSO CAUSE US TO LOSE OUR NEIGHBORS. A RECENT STUDY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY ALONE SHOWED THAT OVER HALF THE DISPLACED LOW INCOME RESIDENTS HAD TO LEAVE THEIR ENTIRE COMMUNITY. LOCAL CAN PREFERENCES ARE CRITICAL TOOL MANY CITIES HAVE USED TO STABILIZE NEIGHBORHOODS AND PRIORITIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. HOWEVER LOCAL TOLD LIEUTENANT PREFERENCES LACK THE STATEWIDE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO CONFIDENTLY USE THEM IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FUNDED WITH TAX CREDITS AND BOND FINANCING. SB SIX FORTY NINE CREATES A STATE POLICY THAT SUPPORTS HOUSING FOR POPULATIONS AT HIGH RISK FOR FACING DISPLACEMENT THROUGH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. CAN USE TENET PURPOSES AND THEREFORE BY HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO PROTECT THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THESE CHANGES WILL HELP US TARGET THE BENEFITS OF SCARCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LIMIT DISPLACEMENT AND REDUCE THE MANY HARMS THAT RESULT FROM DISPLACEMENT. BUT THE USE OF LOCAL TENANT PREFERENCES CAN ALSO HELP REDUCE OPPOSITION. TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ENHANCE THE PROJECT PREDICTABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS LEGISLATION COMPLEMENT STATE AND FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING LAW BUT SUPPORTING LOCAL POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER DIVERSITY IN HOUSING CHOICE. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. OF A COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR THEIR EXCELLENT WORK. BUT WITH US. EXTENSIVELY ON THIS BILL A TO GET READY TODAY. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

I JUST HAVE A QUESTION- CENTER CORTESE WITH REGARDS TO- THIS BAIL IN BEING- I KNOW IS THAT IS A REAL TOUR ONE OF THE YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT- THEIR HOUSING LAWS AND SO FORTH HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THE ISSUE THAT THIS MAY BE- IN VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION- THERE. WHEN THE CASHIER ASKED ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS- WHY DIDN'T SPELL OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE WORD AND- PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT BUT ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT- WAS BROUGHT FORWARD. COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS WAS TO CALL OUT THAT. IF THE BILL IS ENACTED THAT IT DOES NEED TO- TO ABIDE BY. THOSE LAWS RULES FEDERAL HOUSING LAWS THAT YOU JUST IDENTIFIED. ANY OTHER RESIDENTS ARE BOTH OF THE JUST FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES SO IT IT IS. STILL UP IN THE AIR AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT IT IN. REGISTER THOSE LAWS OR ARE WE CLEAR ON IT'S NOT UP IN THE AIR IT JUST GIVES DIRECTION TO LOCAL SAID IF THEY'RE GOING TO HOLD A HEARING. IN QUALIFY A HOUSING PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE FOR TAX EXEMPT BONDS ON THE BASIS OF DISPLACEMENT THAT THEIR- AUTOMATICALLY. GOING TO HAVE TO GO FORWARD- IN ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING LAWS. SO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO DO THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO DO THAT OR THEY WERE ALSO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROCEED PROCEED WITH THE TAX EXEMPT BOND FINANCING WILL BE OLD ENOUGH. AND DINNER BECAUSE IF THEY I MATT I CAN ACTUALLY ADD TO THAT. I'M SORRY WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IN SAN FRANCISCO I WAS PART OF THE EFFORT TO CREATE A ON A LOCAL PREFERENCE- ORDINANCE IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AND IT IS AN ISSUE THAT- YOU'RE THREADING A NEEDLE. FOR SHORE. THE NEW YORK THE LOCAL PREFERENCE THEY WERE CHALLENGED IN FOR. A BOAT WHEN WE WERE PURSUING THIS AND SAN FRANCISCO- AND ACTUALLY OUR MAYOR IT WAS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT. IF A COMMUNITY IS GOING TO ACCEPT AND FIND AND FIGHT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE WANTTO MAKE SURE THAT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE. TO GET INTO THAT AND SO ARE MAYOR MEMORY DOES SHE TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON DC TO MEET WITH HIDE. AND HEART ALTERNATELY SIGNED OFF- AND I THINK IT WAS WE HAD LIKE 40% SO WASN'T THE ENTIRE. AMOUNT IT WAS A PERCENTAGE OF IT AND HIDE SIGNED OFF ON THAT- SO THERE IS SOME MURKINESS ON THIS ISSUE- BOOK BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A NEED ALL THAT COMMUNITIES CAN THREAD AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT AMENDMENT.
