THOUGHT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON THE ISSUE OF ENSURING A SAFE AND RELIABLE GRID -- WE CERTAINLY ARE A PLEASED TO HAVE WITH US A TWO OF OUR MEMBERS WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND THE FIRST HEARING -- SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON WELCOME. AND WE ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCOTT. THIS MAYES FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE TODAY WE KNOW THE DURING THE END OF SUMMER WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET EVERYONE TOGETHER BUT WE APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE TODAY -- WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN -- WITH -- THE FOCUS OF THIS. PRESENTATION OF BEING ON THE ENSURING SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. AND THE OUR PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK. AT THE WORK OF THE CPU SEE AN ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO MITIGATE FIRES AS A RESULT. OF UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M CONFIDENT THE VALUES INCIPIO'S CPUC CAN FILE REVIEW. AND APPROVE MITIGATION PLANS WHAT I REALLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT TODAY'S THE WORK THAT WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE ON THE GROUND. AND WHEN WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE IT DONE. ADDITIONALLY. WHAT DOES ON THE GROUND? OVERSIGHT LOOK LIKE. WHO IS DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECKING THE WORK? AND PARTICULARLY FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE P. O. USE TODAY. THESE UTILITIES VARY IN SIZE FROM SERVING LESS THAN A THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. TO DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND PWER IN LOS ANGELES WHICH SERVES FOUR MILLION. ALTHOUGH THE PO USE EVER RESPONSIBILITY A STATE LAW TO DEVELOP FIRE MITIGATION PLANS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF THOSE PLANS. I'M ALSO CONCERNED THE DUE TO THE SIZE OF SOME OF THE PIER USE THOSE UTILITIES WILL NOT BE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF SAFETY MEASURES. THAT WE WILL REQUIRE OF THAT I USE. HOW WE ADDRESS THOSE GAPS? I'D LIKE TO TURN TO A SENATOR DODD. UP FOR HIS OPENING COMMENTS AND THEN WE WILL CONVENE OUR FIRST PANEL -- AND THAT WILL A TAKE PLACE AFTER HIS COMMENTS. I THINK YOU SOME A MEMBER -- TODAY'S HEARING TOPICS CONCERNING ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON ALL YOUR LONG. I BELIEVE ENSURING A SAFE AND RELIABLE ELECTRIC GRID. IS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE FOR REDUCING UTILITY CAUSE FIRES. ENSURING A SAFER GREAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT STEP TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR INVESTOR AND PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. THE GOVERNOR AND I HAVE PLACE TO IDEAS ON THE TABLE FORGETTING TO A SAFER. ELECTRICAL GRID. THERE MAY BE OTHER APPROACHES TODAY'S HEARING WILL EXAMINE THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES. THERE ARE ADVANTAGES IMPACTS ON SAFETY RATES EFFICIENCY AND MORE AND LOOK TO HEAR IT LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. A MORE IN EACH OF THESE ITEMS PRETTY SENATOR. ARE WE WILL CALL FORWARD OUR FIRST PANEL WHICH IS GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE MECHANICS OUTCOMES AND GAPS IN WELL FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. OF THAT WILL BE LED BY MICHAEL PICKER PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND ELIZA VEDA. MALASHENKO DIRECTOR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. WE WELCOME BOTH OF YOU AGAIN [inaudible] WELCOME. THINK YOU A I'M MICHAEL PICKER AND SOMEONE TO TALK REAL QUICKLY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN TURN HANDED OFF TO THE SEVERITY WHO SKETCH OUT THE SCOPE OF WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS. AND THEN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS SO PALM. I THINK THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT FOR YOU CAME OUT THE DAY BEFORE OUR LAST HEARING SO IT WAS REALLY IN A POSITION TO ADDRESS IT SOMEONE TO TAKE A COUPLE SECOND JUST KINDA RUN THROUGH. OWN HOME. WHAT HE CALLS? FOR SO IN TERMS A WILDFIRE PREVENTION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- BUILD SIGNS OF WILDFIRE PLANTS THAT ARE IN EXISTING LAW PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY SIX ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND S.. SIXTEEN AT THE RIVER AT THE LEADER UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR HILL [inaudible] IT. WHAT THIS? PROPOSAL DOES IS IT TELLS US THAT WE MUST ADOPT THOSE PLANS. RATHER THEN REVEALING COMMENT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ADOPTION IS NECESSARY IF WE WANNA TAKE OUR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS -- HE ADOPTING IT MAKES IT ENFORCEABLE BORDER RATHER THAN JUST DIRECTION TO THE UTILITIES REPORT THEIR PLANTS MAKES THE PLANS ANNUAL. THAT SETS UP GIVEN THE PACE THERE WERE MOVING OUT HE INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR SO THAT WILL ACTUALLY TAKE SOME OF IT OUT OF OUR NORMAL. PUBLICLY EDUCATED PROCESS AND PUT IT TO STAFF LEVELS STAFF WILL THEN MAYBE PRINT TAKE THE RESULTS OF THE REPLANT AFTER IT'S BEEN EVALUATED TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMISSION FOR ADOPTION. WE CURRENTLY DO ENFORCEMENT FOR NON COMPLIANCE BUT THIS SAID SO MANDATORY ELEMENTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY ALONG INCLUDING -- PROTOCOLS FOR HIS DISABLING ONLY CLOSERS DE ENERGY AS A NATION THE NEW VEGETATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ADOPTED EARLIER. THAT WHILE LAST SPRING. HIGH INPUT INSPECTION IF STRUCTURE AND THEN VERY IMPORTANTLY IS THIS THE PROTOCOLS FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION IN RETURNING SERVICE. AND WE'VE GOTTEN MUCH TOUGHER IN A MORE DESCRIPTIVE ON THAT WILL ACTUALLY DE CONSIDERING THAT FOR FINAL ADOPTION HAD THIRD OR THURSDAY MEETING. HITTING CREWS WHO INCREASES OUR ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY SO THIS IS ALWAYS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION HOW MUCH -- ENFORCEMENT FINES AND PENALTIES ACTUALLY GET THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR CHANGES THAT YOU WANT OUT OF PARTY'S -- BUT WE KNOW FROM OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TODAY HAVE FOUND OUR OUR CURRENT CAP A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION PER DAY. TO BE ABSOLUTELY INSUFFICIENT FOR THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS SAFETY MATERIALS ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION SO I THINK THIS IS OUR RECOGNITION AND ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT TO TRY TO ACTUALLY GET US INTO MORE HONG LINE WITH WHAT THE FEDS REQUIRE. IN TERMS TO RATE PAYER PROTECTION WILDFIRE POTENTIAL COSTS ARE REVIEWED FOR REASONABLE LISTEN THE RATE CASE. AND THERE'S NO BLANKET AUTHORITY OFFER OF WELFARE EXPENSE EXPENDITURES IT REQUIRES EVOLUTION OF THE SAFETY CULTURE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF OUR EXAMINATION OF GAS AND ELECTRIC AFTER THE THE SAMPER NOTE. EXPLOSIONS THERE'S NO TOP THE BOTTOM CULTURE AROUND SAFETY. WITHIN THAT ORGANIZATION. TOM WE SAW LOTS OF HIGHLIGHTS OF REAL STRENGTH AROUND SAFETY WITHIN P. GINNY BUT IT WAS A UNIVERSAL THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION THAT CULTURE WASN'T THERE THE YOU NEED TO SEE WHERE EVERYBODY IN THE ORGANIZATION. RESPONSE ON A DAILY BASIS TO EVERY DECISION THAT THEY MAKE WITH SOME CONSIDERATION OF THAT. AND IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME SOME OF THE REFORMS FOR THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR FOR WHILE FAR LIABILITY. YOU CAN SEE CONTINUES TO ENSURE THAT OF THOSE WHO ACT NEGLIGENTLY OR HELD LIABLE. IT'S MODELED AFTER THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SIDE JURISPRUDENCE FOR FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S IT ALLOWS THE COURT TO WEIGH THE REASONABLENESS OF AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES DECISIONS. AND SO MY OBSERVATION IS THAT IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT I SAID EARLIER THIS YEAR AND SYNONYMOUS THAT -- HERE DIFFERENT LAWYERS GIVING DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON HOW HOW MUCH WE CAN ACTUALLY DO IN TERMS OF GIVING DIRECTION TO THE COURTS UNDER THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION PROVISIONS OF THE SAY CONSTITUTION. BUT MANY ATTORNEYS NOW TELL IMMEDIATELY EAST AND HAVE HAVE ADVICE THE THROUGH CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT AND IF THERE'S GOING TO BE CHALLENGES SOME OF THE UP TO A COURT TO DECIDE -- SO THOSE ARE THE KEY FEATURES OF THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS GOING TO TAKE SECOND TO KIND OF RUN THROUGH THAT. AS IT TURNED IT OVER TO LISA CENTER TO QUICKLY TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR HIGH UTILITY WILDFIRE PREVENTION. AND THEN WE CAN GET INTO YOUR VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK OF AND HERE TODAY AGAIN. POEM. I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THE PRESENTATION. IN FRONT OF YOU -- THAT OUTLINES THE POLICY FRAMEWORK [inaudible] NO. OKAY OUT WELL I AM GOING TO GO THROUGH WITH MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IT OF LEADER NO. BUT THE EL THEN THE FUNDAMENTAL SO ASPECT OF IT IS YOU NEED THREE L. COMPONENTS FOR A WILD FIRE VOWED TO TAKE PLACE. WELL YOU NEED FUEL -- YOU NEED IGNITION AND THE L. SOURCE [inaudible] AND WHETHER. AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THE THE FROM POLICIES THAT WE COULD PUT IN PLACE IN DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WHETHER IT'S GOVERNMENT THE UTILITIES OR ANY OTHER AND CITY. AND THINK IT'S HOPEFUL TO GO. TO REMEMBER THOSE THOSE THREE ASPECTS THAT BOTH DISCREET BUT THEY ALSO IN IRAQ WITH ONE ANOTHER HOME IN THEM. IN ORDER. TO ON ONE HAND EL CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR WILD FIRES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AS WELL. ON THE MITIGATION SIDE WE NEED ALL OF THOSE THREE COMPONENTS TO BE -- WORKING TOGETHER FOR US TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THOSE THREATS. NELSON THE FUEL MANAGEMENT SIDE IN THE UTILITY CON SEX WITH PRIMARILY TALKING ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING FIDGET SEASTRAND ROUNDS. BUT WHAT CLIENTS -- BUT THAT WOULD MANAGING THE MUD SITUATED THEY DON'T POSE A THREAT SO REDUCING THE FUEL AROUND THE ELECTRIC O. FACILITIES ON THE IGNITION CONTROL THAT'S THE AREA WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING. ON EN EL THE INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF IS THE CAUSE OF THE IGNITION. SO SPARKS RELATED TO ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE ALICE THAT THIS IS THE DOMAIN OF REALLY ASSET MANAGEMENT OF UTILITIES HARD YOU MANAGE LINES EL IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU ARE IDENTIFYING FOLDS IN THE U. MINIMIZING THEIR FAILURE. CALM AND EVEN JUST UP OPERATING THE EQUIPMENT IN SUCH A WAY THAT DOZENS THOUGH BECAUSE IN THE MEASURE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE CHANCES OF THAT HAPPENING. AND THEN THE WEATHER PREPAREDNESS SIDE THIS IS WERE WE TALKING ABOUT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WELL WITH THIS THE STRANDS O. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE CLIMATE IS BEHAVING AND GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AT RESPONDING TO THOSE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND. SO AT THE AT THE VERY HIGH LEVEL THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND OF THE FRAMEWORK IS THIS THREE CATEGORIES AND LOOKING AT EACH OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN UNDERSTANDING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE TOWN THOSE THREE AREAS. WELL. THROUGH THE THERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES ALL TPC OF RECENT POLICY ACTIONS INEACH ONE OF THOSE DOMAINS -- THE UCBCP YOU SEE HAS BEEN LOOKING UP WHILE FIRE SAFETY FOR A LONG TIME AND SLOW LONG HISTORY OF DECISIONS THAT -- HOST BE IN OVERTIME STRENGTHENING OF THE REGULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THE BIGGEST CHANGE. YOU KNOW WAS ADOPTED BY LAST YEAR WELL IT WAS A SET OF REGULATIONS THAT MATCH THE WILD FIRE -- HAZARD PLANS AND ALL THAT WERE ALSO ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION BUT THE VIN SEVERAL OTHER DECISIONS IN THE FROM PROCEEDINGS AND STAFF ACTIONS AS WELL SOME EXAMPLES IN FUEL MANAGEMENT SO THIS IS WHERE THE DECISION ADOPTED MORE STRINGENT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS. REQUIREMENTS INCREASING OUR CLEARANCE LEVELS FOR EXAMPLE ROUND DISTRIBUTION LINES O. AND VARYING THE REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON THE O. WILD FIRE HAZARD IN THE AREA [inaudible] WELL. IF THE EXAMPLES IN THE UTILITY CONTROL SIDE OWE THE STRICTER MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS PATROLLING IN HI FI THREADS OWNS. BETWEEN WIRES THAT HELPS MITIGATE WILD THE WIRE FEELY AB ALSO JUST PARKS THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY A OH WIRES FLYING INTO EACH OTHER IN HIGH WIND CONDITIONS. CALM AND PUTTING REQUIREMENTS AND PLEASE FOR INSPECTION OF OVERHEAD COMMUNICATION FACILITIES THAT WAS NOT IN PLACE. BEFORE BUT IT AND THE TOTAL COMMUNICATION FACILITIES THEMSELVES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN SEEN AS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY CAUSE A WILDFIRE THREAT BY IT BECAUSE THEY ARE COOL A KEY TO THE USUALLY WITH ELECTRIC CLIENTS. IT'S ACTUALLY JUST AS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE MAINTAINING THEIR TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES IN THE SAFE MATTER NOT OVERLOADING THE POLLS NOT APPROACHING THEM IT'S ALREADY SPACE -- NOT CREATING CONDITIONS WHERE IT FEELING OF LEE COOK TELECOMMUNICATION LINE CAN THEN BECAUSE OF FEELING OF ELECTRIC LINE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH. IT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART FOR THE PROCESS OF IMPROVING OUR REGULATIONS AND THEN ON THE WEATHER O. ON SITUATIONAL AWARENESS SIDE. BUT WE HOPE THE WILDFIRE MOPS -- AND THE G. EMERGENCY SOME POLICY THAT -- ALL HOPES AT ALL THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH UTILITIES CAN BETTER RESPOND TO CONDITIONS IN REAL TIME -- LAST SO. MEASURE OF LAST RESORT AT ALL WHEN THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY HEALTH FOR SAFETY. WELL I'M SO THAT THE JUST SOME EXAMPLES. WE KNOW PROVIDED A LIST OF OWE. THE DECISIONS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THOUGH TO THE TWENTY DECISIONS AND THEY GET VERY TECHNICAL SOMEONE GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THE ALL BUT THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF ACTIONS THAT THE COMMISSION IS STICKING EACH ONE OF THOSE AREAS TO DATE HOME. SO NOW I'M GONNA TURN TALKING ABOUT MORE OF THE PRIORITY FOR FUTURE ACTIONS AND WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT'S SO OUR ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE UTILITIES ARE CALM CONCERNS OF PREVENTION MEASURES IN EACH ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES. WELL LISTEN THE FUEL MANAGEMENT OF THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT O. TRADITIONALLY THIS IS BE IN A THAT LARGELY MANUAL PROCESS THE WAY IT'S WORKS OF THE UTILITIES AND THIS IS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND GLOBALLY IT'S AND THIS ISN'T THE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC. WELL PROCESS O. UTILITIES DIVIDE THEIR TERRITORY IN TWO SECTIONS OF THE HALL OF OF SCHEDULES AT WHICH SHOW EVERY ONE OF THOSE AREAS NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED THEY HIRE A CONTRACTOR. TO GIVE THEM THE MAP IN THE SCHEDULE AND SAY YOU HAVE TO INSPECT THIS AREA ON THE SCHEDULE AND THEN. CALM. AYE AND IDENTIFY ANY VEGETATION THAT NEEDS TO BE MANAGED AND THEN THERE'S THE SECOND SORT OF LAYER OF WORK THAT SEEKS POLICE AND BASED ON THAT INITIAL INSPECTION A SECOND. THE ROOFS SORT OF WORK IS DONE WHERE WELL. CREWS GO OUT AND ACTUALLY CUT THE VEGETATION AND MAINTAIN THAT SO IT'S A VERY -- AND LIEBERMAN SENSE OF PROCESS ALONE IS INVOLVES A LOT OF ALL BUT JUDGMENT BUT INDIVIDUAL BY FOREST THERE ISN'T BY ARE BRUCE WHO PERFORM THAT INITIAL INSPECTION. AL I HAVEN'T TRIED THIS OUT IN PRACTICE BOY I THINK THAT IF YOU WOULD SEND SEND THE FROM OUR PERSONAL FORESTERS IN THE SAME ROUTE THE RULES COME BACK WITH VARYING RESULTS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST HOW HUMANS WORK. RATE WHEN YOU'RE EITHER YOU VISUALLY PICKING OUT THINGS LIKE CRACKS IN THAT FREEZING YOU USING YOUR JUDGMENT AND YOUR EXPERTISE. SO. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT A HOME. AND THEN THE SECONDARY PART OF FORM THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES THERE REALLY JUST THERE TO FLIP FOLLOWING YOU KNOW THE GUIDELINES OF HOW TO SAFELY OF THE KATA REMOVER TREE. ALSO THE REALLY OWE MORE OF JUST EXPERTS ON HOW TO TRIM THE TREE IN AND NOT NOT REALLY THEREFORE IN ANY ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT PURPOSES. AND ELM THIS THE THIS IS EXPENSE OF WITH SPENDS AM. A THING CLOSE TO PROBABLY HALF A BILLION OF DOLLARS GO ALL OPRAH RATIONS A MAINTENANCE ACROSS ALL OF THE UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OF MAINTENANCE OF RIGHT OF WAYS OF PEOPLE WALKING AROUND. CALM DOING THIS THESE ASSESSMENTS AND THEN TRIMMING -- THE TREES. CALM AND THEY GET THEM FROM UTILITY POINT OF VIEW THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON COMPLIANCE SO WHAT THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING. FOR CALM IN THIS IS MEAN MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER IS NOT REQUIRED CLEARANCE IS MAINTAINED AND THEN TRIMMING BACK THE VEGETATION THAT'S LIKELY TO GROW AND SO THAT CLEARANCE SPACE. WOULD THEN THE NEXT CYCLE RATES OF THEIR TRIMMING IT FURTHER THAN WHAT THE REQUIRED CLEARANCES IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE NEXT TIME WE COME AROUND I'LL BE HERE LATER AND THEY NEED THAT BALL. FOR A CALM AND THEN THE RULES OF PICKING UP YOU KNOW OBVIOUS HAZARDS SUCH AS OF THAT TREE WELL THE PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT IN THE CLIMATE SITUATION THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW. WHERE WE FREQUENTLY SEEING EL VERY HIGH WINDS -- YOU HAVING HEALTHY TREES FAIL CALM AND AND BRANCHES AND THEY FLY FROM OUTSIDE OF THE CLEARANCE SPACE. CALM AND SO. THAT AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE THE FOR ONE OF THE THE MENTAL CHALLENGES WITH THIS PARADIGM THAT IF YOU ONLY FOCUSING ON MAINTENANCE OR ALL OF YOUR CLEARANCES ABOVE YOUR RIGHT OF WAY WHICH YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BILL. IT'S THOUGH BY NO MEANS AT ALL BE SURE PROOF WAY TO CALM SUFFICIENTLY MITIGATES THE O. THE VEGETATION O. THE FUEL LOW RISK THAT WE'RE FACING. SO THERE ARE SOLUTIONS OUT THERE CALM NOT ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED WIDELY BLADES WELL THIS IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR A BIG THE THE MACHINE LEARNING ALL SOLUTION AND THE SO SOMETHING THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN HOPE WITH. A WHOLE NEW FLYING. DRONES OR OF THE DOING OF THE AERIAL PATROLS AND COLLECTING A LOT OF VISUAL DETAILS FOR LIGHT OR ANOTHER SERVING OF SOMETHING THATS DONE THE TRANSMISSION HOME ON THE ANNUAL BASIS. BUT THOSE -- VERY VERY DIFFERENT QUANTITIES SO UTILITIES HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT SO MUCH DISTRIBUTION SIDE. AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE COSTS AND AND SOME OF THE REASONS BUT EXPANDING THAT DATA COLLECTION AND THEN THAT CHALLENGE WITHOUT RIGHT NOW IS JUST PROCESSING THE WITH THE VOLUME OF DATA FAST ENOUGH. THOUGH TO MAKE IT USEFUL EL BUT AGAIN THOSE AT A THING THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ABOVE ALL OF THEM THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES AT LOOKING AT ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IN BOTH EMERGING. COMBINING SATELLITE DATA -- THEM WITH -- WHO'S SERVING RESULTS AT HOME AND OTHER WAYS AND USING HOME ADVANCED COMPUTING TO DO MUCH MORE GO HOME. ADVANCED THOUGH RISK MANAGEMENT THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO DO WITH HUMANS CALM AND THAT'S JUST A QUESTION OF NUMBERS AND VOLUMES THE HEADS WE CAN PROCESS A LOT MORE IT WOULD BE TO WITH MACHINES. SO THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THAT RISK ASSESSMENT YOU COULD START. TO TAKING PEOPLE OUT THERE DOING SECONDARY VERIFICATIONS THAT IS WHERE THE INDUSTRY IS MOVING TO WORDS. IT IS NOT ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN DEPLOYED GLOBALLY THE ONLY OTHER PLACE THAT'S BEEN SORT OF ON THE EDGES A IN AUSTRALIA. CALM. BUT I THINK DESERT KIND OF THE AREAS TO BE LOOKING AND SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NEXT FRONTIER OF HOW DO WE MANAGE THIS PROBLEM RATHER THAN JUST FOCUSING ON MAKING THESE CLEARANCES WELL WHITER -- IT IS THEN I WILL GO THROUGH AS MUCH DIESEL IN SOME OF THE OTHER ONES A A THINK YOU THERE'S BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION ON SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. AND WHETHER PREPAREDNESS AND UNDERSTANDING L. WHETHER IT THE MORE GRANULAR LEVEL AND SOME SUCCESSES THOUGH. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FROM -- SEEM TO YOU. WITH THE PLAYING WHAT THE STATIONS AND MOST CRITICALLY COLLECTING GRANULAR WIND INFORMATION CALL BECAUSE THAT BOTH GIVES YOU ON THE GROUND THOUGH. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN PROXIMITY TO THE ELECTRIC CLIENTS BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO DO MUCH BETTER MODELING AND UNDERSTANDING RISKS AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ACTUAL WHAT THE CONDITIONS WERE HOPPING. AND GET MORE GRANULAR BUT THAT'S HOMES DOES A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS AREA AND THEN ON THE IGNITION CONTROL. THOUGH. THERE ARE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THE UTILITIES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYING WACO ó FULL SUN SAYING BEING ABLE TO PINPOINT SINCE. THAT DISCONNECT LINES WHEN THERE'S SO FOLDS WHICH COULD INDICATE VEGETATION CONTACTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO ONE OF THE NEXUS IS OVER THE NEXT ALSO IN THESE THREE AREAS IS -- USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IN GOING BEYOND SOME OF THOSE MORE MANUAL WAYS OVER A DONE A FINE RISKS AND DOING VISUAL HUMAN INSPECTIONS AND THINKING OF HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS MORE AT SCALE AND FASTER. USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA STREAMS AND ADVANCE THE ANALYSIS. AND THAT TIES TO THE QUESTION ALL OF OH DOUBLE CHECKING AND HELPING BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND WHOSE VALIDATING THE THIS AND THE INSPECTIONS OF THE UTILITIES A PERFORMING. CALM YEAH LIKE UTILITIES SO. HOW FLOW VETO WHO OVER THIRTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THE IN CALIFORNIA ALL TOGETHER I MEAN IF WE'RE GOING TO DUPLICATE THE WORKING NAY GAINES CREATES SOME WAS SIZE WORKFORCE JUST UNITS JUST NUMBER IS RIGHT? AND JUST PUTTING PEOPLE OUT THERE TO DOUBLE CHECK PEOPLE ISN'T PROBABLY THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY ESPECIALLY FOR THE STATE'S WHERE IT SUCCESS. JUST TIME TO GET BUDGETS THROUGH AND HIRE PEOPLE AND TRAIN THEM AND MANAGE THEM. HOME SO WE SHOULD COULD OPPONENTS OF IT THEM BOOTS ON THE GROUND WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DOUBLED ó MORE THAN DOUBLED OUR ELECTRIC SAFETY PROGRAM AND ABOUT THE LAST TO JUST TWO YEARS. HOME WHILE WE'VE HIRING IN DOUBLING THAT SEEKS TIME WE FROM MANAGEMENT EXPERTS STAFF TO HIRE THOSE PEOPLE AND TRAIN THEM SO THERE'S A COST TO THAT AS WELL. SO WE CAN NEEDS TO BE MINDFUL AS WE DOING THESE THINGS ALSO BUT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN TECHNOLOGY NOT ONLY FOR THAT INITIAL ASSESSMENTS BUT ALSO IN HOW WE OUGHT IT. BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED AS MANY PEOPLE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE RESULTS OVER YOU YOU KNOW OWN FLAVOR VIDEO CAMERA. HOME OR A LIDAR HOME IN OF THE DEED A I WAS JUST I ASK IS THAT THE P. YOU SEE DOUBLING UP OR IS THAT -- THAT'S THE P. YOU SEE YES OF THE STAFF IN MY SECTION HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE ELECTRIC. POLICIES TO BRANCH BACK WELL SIX YEARS AGO THOSE ONLY ONE GROUP IS ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE THAT OVERSAW ALL OF ELECTRIC ALL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND GAS. SAFETY THIRTY PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE STATE SO THAT'S WHERE WE WERE -- HOME. ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO SO WE HAVE NOW MORE THAN THREE PEOPLE OF JUST DEDICATED TO THE GAS SAFETY PROGRAM AND MORE THAN THIRTY PEOPLE IN THE ELECTRIC AND THAT THIRTY HOUSE DOUBLED FROM ABOUT A DOZEN AND THAT WE HAD JUST TWO YEARS AGO. SO WE'VE BEEN GROWING QUITE A LOS CALM IN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR STAFFING. AT HOME. BUT THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THOSE SORT OF MATHEMATICIAN NUMBERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ALL STILL BE HAPPY TALK MORE ABOUT THIS IN IN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS BUT I JUST WANTED TO PUT A PIN THAN THOSE THAT THE YOU KNOW AND WE SHOULD. I THINK NOT ONLY BE LOOKING AT AT PEOPLE AND STAFFING AND HOW MANY AUDITS WITH DOING THAT HUMANS AND HAULING YOU LINES WERE PATROLLING PHYSICALLY. BUT ALSO THINKING HOW CAN WE DO SOME OF THAT DOUBLE CHECKING AT ALL WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND USE MACHINES IN THE BOUNCE LEARNING AND SCHOOLS THAT AND NOW ALL BECOMING AVAILABLE. TO US THAT WEREN'T EVEN THE COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THIS WAS PROBABLY NOT TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE BUT WHEN NOW NOT COSTS WERE WE CAN ACTUALLY THINK. DO THIS AT THAT SCALE AND NOT JUST THEN AND PILOTS CALM. THEN ELMO LAST THE SO THE LAST SLADE AND SO IT SORT OF SHIFTING GEARS A LITTLE BIT WHO CALLED THE THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS THE KNOTS AND BOLTS OF HOW. THESE HIGH LEVEL IDEAS SORT OF MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN THE REGULATORY SPACE BECAUSE WE USE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND WE HAVE THE FRIEND. OF HISTORIC PROCESS SEES THROUGH WHICH WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE THE BALL FORWARD HELM. ON THESE ITEMS AND SO THE ROUGHLY SPEAKING SRI DIFFER IT'LL FLOAT WERE EXTREMES I WOULD SAY A THREE DIFFERENT PROPHECIES AROUND THOUGH SO ONE OF THEM IS THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION ON PLANNING. ALMOST OF THIS IS THE DOMAIN WHERE UTILITIES AT ALL. SO THE VOCAL PLANS OF HOW THE GOING TO MITIGATE O. WILDFIRE RISKS IN THIS PACIFIC TERRITORIES THAT FILE THEM WITH THE COMMISSION OF CURRENTLY TAKES PLACE AS PART OF THEIR GENERAL ORDER ONE SIXTY SIX REQUIREMENTS IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR AWHILE. THOUGH. THERE IS SOME NEW PLAN REQUIREMENTS BUT THAT THE FRAMEWORK IS MORAL US THE SAME. CALM THE PURPOSE OF THESE PLANS ISRAELI INFORMING I DON'T MEAN YOU STAKEHOLDERS AS TO WHAT THE UTILITIES ARE DOING AND COLLECTING FEEDBACK A STING IMPROVEMENTS IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A PLAN. WELL YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO ANY SUITABLE FOR OF THE INDO PROOF WOULD. ORGANIZATION THAT NEEDS TO HELP EMERGENCY RESPONSE YOU YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN A RISK OF MITIGATION PLAN TO THIS GOOD THINGS TO HALT IT GETS PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES ARE UP IN THE VAN SUBMIT GIVES A GOOD FRAMEWORK FOR COLLABORATION. AND IT'S COOL AGAIN FOR A FOOD FOR EVERYONE TO WILL SIMPLY GOOD FAITH ASSESS ALL PERFORMANCE AFTER THE FACT RATES SO THE WAY THAT YOU NEED WHETHER IT'S FIRE OR ANY OTHER KIND OF SO THE SITUATION WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS HAVE A PLAN. AND THEN YOU YOU HOW THE VANCE AND THEN YOU GO AND YOU COMPARE HOW YOU PERFORMED AGAINST THE PLAN YOU DO LESSONS LEARNED THAN THE NEW REVISED THE PLANNING YOU CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE SO PLAN SERVE THAT IMPORTANT PORT PURPOSE. THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND RATE MAKING AT ALL IS THE AREA OF WHERE WE FUNDS UTILITIES WELL BEFORE I GO. AGAIN. FIRE A FEW YEARS AGO FOR LET'S SAY FIVE YEARS AGO AND ALL THE COMMISSION HOW THE AT ALL VERY DISTINCT JUST THREE MAKING FUNCTIONS SO THE OTHER UTILITIES. ON THE CYCLE COME UP WHEN THEY ASK FOR A FOR MONEY THROUGH GENERAL REEKIE SUPPLICATIONS AND THEN ABOUT THE FROM PARTIES ARGUE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IT'S TOO MUCH NOT ABOUT. COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT THE VOTES ABOUT AND IT WAS ALWAYS DONE FROM VERY RATES POINTS OF VIEW ON THE COSTS THAN THE MAIN PARTIES IN THERE WOULD RATE PAYER IN PHOENIX. WELL THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZED THE GALLUP POLL THAT THAT WAS IN THE BIG ENOUGH A CONSIDERATION OF SAFETY THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND WENT THROUGH A VERY LENGTHY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DESIGN A BETTER WAY TO DO RATE CASES IN THE WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS CONSIDERED AT THAT TIME. IN THE METHODOLOGY THAT ABOUT THE CAN RATE PAYER INTERVENE ISN'T SAFETY ADVOCATES IN MANY DIFFERENT GROUP CAME UP WITH WAS THE SORT OF THREE STEP PROCESS WHERE FOR THE FIRST PART IT IS THE SOMETHING CALLED US MY PROCESS WHICH IS BASICALLY METHODOLOGY FOR RISK ASSESSMENT. AND IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A DATA DRIVEN SO THAT IS THE VERY DETAILED WAY THAT UTILITIES GO IN THE SENSE THEIR OPERATIONAL RISKS. AND AGAIN HIS MODELS WERE EVALUATED HOW HE EATS ALL THESE CATEGORIES THIS RISK QUANTIFY THOSE RISKS AND HOW THE BILL THESE MODELS. SO THE COMMISSION WENT THROUGH A PROCESS OF APPROVING THOSE MODELS WHICH IS HOW YOU DO RISK ASSESSMENTS IN GENERAL AT UTILITY AND THERE'S AN ONGOING WAY TO KEEP MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO IT. THE SECOND STOP IS RAMP WHICH IS A UTILITY SPECIFIC FILING WHERE UTILITY. BEFORE FILING THE REEKIE SAYS RIGHT NOW THIS IS OUR ASSESSMENT OF OUR SPECIFIC RISKS IN THIS IS HOW WE RANK THEM WILL UTILITIES THROUGH BELIEVE A SINGLE ROUND THREAT RANK BELOW WILDFIRES IS NUMBER ONE SEEK TO RISK AND THEN IT GOES DOWN FROM THERE. CALM AND THEN THE INCOMES OF THE GENERAL SO THATTHERE'S A PROCESS TO CONSIDER THAT IN FOR COMMISSION TO VOTE ON WHETHER THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND THEN THE RE KEANE'S COMES. WHERE THE REQUEST FOR MONEY? MATCHES SORT OF THE RISK CATEGORIES IN THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS WHAT ABOUT SUFFICIENT ENDS AND THEN ONCE THAT GETS ADOPTED IN THE BACK AND THERE'S REPORTING AND AUDITING TO MAKE SURE THAT UTILITIES ARE SPENDING MONEY WHERE. THE SAID WEEKEND SUSPENDED ON SAFETY IN THE TH BE DEVIATE FROM THEIR REQUEST THEN THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY. SO THAT'S THE NEW MODEL THAT THE COMMISSION'S ADOPTED AROUND RISK ASSESSMENT RATE MAKING. AND THEN THE LAST SECTION OF THE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS DRIVEN BY COMMISSIONS GENERAL ORDERS -- GENERAL WOULD IN NINETY FIVE THAT YOU HEAR I HAD -- ELECTRIC UNTIL COMMUNICATION FACILITIES. OWE THEM. THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE USE A STYLE FOR AUDITS AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS. CALM THAT'S A STRICT CODE THAT SAYS THIS IS HOW YOUR CAN USE NEED TO CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN YOUR SYSTEM THAT'S WHERE THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENT LIVES. AND TELL THEM IN ON THE BACK END OF DIED BECAUSE THERE ISN'T FORCE MONTH ACTIONS THAT THAT STAFF AND COMMISSION CAN SEEK IN THE RANGE FOR ALL. ALL IN ALL INCOME FOR MONTHS AND WORKING WITH THE UTILITY TO ALL CORRECTIVE ITS HOLES THROUGH PROGRESSIVE LEVELS OF ENFORCEMENT THAT CAN INCLUDE CITATION THAT'S A STAFF LOW FINANCIAL PENALTY. ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND THE PORT INSTITUTING IN THE INVESTIGATION WHICH ARE LARGE ADJUDICATORY PROCEEDINGS. SO THESE OF THE PAIN OF BEING CALM SEPARATES THOUGH EFFORTS UP TO THE STATES. AND ONE OF THE SO THINGS THAT I IN THE CURRENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS DOING IS CLOSING THE GAPS BETWEEN NAM. CALM SAID THE WAY THAT THIS THIS IS OF ALL OF THE WHERE THINKING IN THE SEPARATE STREAMS MORAL AS WE'VE HAD JUNE YOU KNOW IMPROVEMENTS OF OUR GENERAL QUARTERS AND OUR COMPLIANCE. EFFORTS WE'VE HAD IMPROVEMENTS AND AND CONSIDERING SAFETY RISKS WITHIN THE RATE MAKING AND THEN WE'VE HAD THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANNING WITH THE WORD THE WASN'T A LOT OF WORK DONE TOOL -- TO INTEGRATE THOSE THREE EFFORTS SIPPING THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS AT ALL. DOING TWO THINGS IT IS SO. IT'S GOOD IT'S BUILDING UPON WHAT THE WORKERS OR YOU CAN DIE BECAUSE THIS TOOK A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP AND NOT ALL OF FRUITS OF BOTH HOW COME TO BEAR YET. CALM BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES TIME FOR FOR THINGS TO GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY SYSTEM IN THAT SECTION HE IMPACT ON THE GROUND AND SITTING YOUR CYCLE IT'S JUST HOW IT WORKS IN ISRAELI LARGE INDUSTRIES. SO WE'RE JUST ABOUT POINT WHERE WE SHOULD BE STARTING TO SEE A LOT OF BENEFITS FROM US SO CHANGING SO SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW WOULD JUST SET US BACK. SO THE CURRENT PROPOSAL BUILDS UPON THIS FRAMEWORK BUT IT ALSO CLOSES THE GAPS BETWEEN THEM BY FOR EXAMPLE HOME CREATING SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR LINKING WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANNING WITH THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND RATE MAKING [inaudible] ELMER. AND THAT I THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. I KNOW IT TOOK UP QUITE A BIT OF TIME DOES SO WITH THAT I WILL A TURNIP OF AND THANK YOU OF ALTERED TO TO MEMBERS AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS BASED ON THE PRESENTATION. UNDER JACK'S. THANK YOU -- SO I WASN'T A AT THE EARLIER MEETING BECAUSE I HAD LONG STANDING PLANTS TO TAKER. AN EXPEDITION TYPE BOTH THROUGH THE FJORDS AND THE GLACIERS IN ALASKA. AND IN THAT PREPARATION I WAS TOLD NO ALASKA'S A RAIN FOREST IN IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES. AND SO I A MAKE SURE YOU BRING MUD BOOTS SOMETHING I NEVER OWNED AND BE PREPARED FOR LOTS OF RAIN IN FORTY DEGREE WEATHER. ENTIRE EIGHT DAYS TO THEIR IT WAS SUNNY AND SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES. NOW THE JOKE WAS I BROUGHT MY SANTA BARBARA WHETHER WITH US. BUT FOR THE PEOPLE IN ALASKA THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE. AND SO THE FACT OF MY MENTIONING THIS IS THAT ALL THROUGHOUT PROBABLY THE WORLD WE ARE SEEING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE. AND IN DOING SO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A NEW NORMAL -- BUT OTHERS TALK ABOUT THE FACT THERE IS NO NORMAL. THAT THERE IS TRUST UNCERTAINTY. AND I THINK -- THAT YOU IT AS WE AS I LISTEN TO YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY I AM. DEEPLY CONCERNED -- ABOUT THE FACT THAT -- WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY KIND OF COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING WHAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS STATE AS GOVERNMENT WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE SAFETY. AND SECURITY OF OUR PEOPLE. AND AS WE ARE HERE RIGHT NOW FIRES ARE YET AGAIN BURNING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND TO IT'S ONLY SEVEN MONTHS SINCE THE WILDFIRE THE DEVASTATED MY COMMUNITY WHICH BECAME. THE LARGEST WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY IT IS NOW BEEN SUPERSEDED JUST SEVEN MONTHS LATER. BY THE MENDOCINO FIRES. AND SO -- I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE THE P. UC'S ROLE. IN ESTABLISHING A AND WHEN IT COMES TO A ADDRESSING THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF OF THE POTENTIAL FOR WILDFIRES IN THE REALITIES CREATED BY. OUR UTILITY COMPANIES AND EITHER THE MISMANAGEMENT THE NEGLIGENCE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT WHEN THESE POLLS FALL -- OR CREATE SPARKS TO CREATE THESE FIRES THAT BURNED DOWN -- THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE'S HOMES TAKE LIVES DESTROYED BUSINESSES DESTROYER CON TO ME WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE P. UC'S ROLE. IN DEVELOPING THE SAFETY PLANS AND HOW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY AT THIS POINT TIME YOU ARE -- EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING WHAT HAS BECOME. THE NEW NORMAL OR THE UNCERTAIN NORMAL WHERE WE ARE SEEING THESE MASSIVE FIRES. OVER THE LAST FIVE AND TEN YEARS. SO THANK YOU FOR A MINUTE JUST KEY OFFER WHAT YOU SAID AND THAT QUESTION IS UNCERTAINTY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT IS CLEARLY UNCERTAIN AS WE STARTED THIS YEAR ALL OF FOCUS WAS ON UTILITY INDUCED FIRES AND ONLY ONE IN TEN FIRE COME FROM UTILITIES. AS A MATTER OF FACT IS A FIRE THAT SU PROSTITUTE MISFIRE ACTUALLY WAS CAUSED BY A MOTORCYCLE. XIKAR FIRE WAS CAUSED BY A PASSING CAR WITH A DEFECT. YEAH SO I HATE IT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. I DON'T THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AROUND THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES OR ANY OF THE COULD THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE COVER CAN ADDRESS ALL OF THE CHALLENGES. THAT IS SO OUR TASK IS TO REALLY FOCUS UNTIL UNTIL YOU TELL US THE YOU WANT US TO BECOME THE DEPARTMENT OF FAR OF FORCE FIRE ATTENTION. WE WE WILL FOCUS ON THE THE THE THE MANY MANY DIFFERENT -- TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING. SO PART OF IT HAS BEEN. REBUILD THE STRENGTH OF A SAFETY FUNCTION AT THE P. YOU SAY. AS ALWAYS A BETTER SAID WE WERE FAIRLY WEAK WHEN I GOT THERE -- PEOPLE DIDN'T TALK TO ME ABOUT SAFETY I THINK WE'VE COME A LONG WAY BUT WE HAVE A LOT FURTHER TRY JUSTICE AGO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO YOU ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON IS HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THE YOU'RE STAYING WITH UP WITHOUT CHANGES. NOW AS A REGULATORY AGENCY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE BEHIND THE BALL. POSSESS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE MOVED TO THIS RISK ASSESSMENT MANAGEMENT PHASE IN THE RATE MAKE. IT MOVES INTO NOT JUST A REGULATORY BUT A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL SO THAT WE DON'T GET SHARPER CUT SHORT OF HAVING TO DO THREE YEARS OF LITIGATED DISCUSSION OVER A RULE. THAT ACTUALLY SPECIFIES ACTIONS THAT THEN CHANGES NEW TECHNOLOGIES COME INTO THE MARKETPLACE OR CONDITIONS CHANGE IT'S DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY GET AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT ARE THE RISKS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND WHAT YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON TO ACTUALLY BRING THEM DOWN. SO THAT I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IT DOESN'T. I SHOULD THE CEILING. IT ACTUALLY SAYS THE FLOOR WILL CONSTANTLY RISE. SO THIS IS FAIRLY NEW WINNERS WERE IN THE END OF OUR FIRST CYCLE STARTING OUR SECOND CYCLE OF THESE PLANTS WERE LEARNING. WE'RE SEEING THINGS AND I WILL POINT OUT THAT EVERYBODY IS A WIN IN START TO DO THAT RATHER THAN COMPLYING WITH A HARD AND FAST RULES. LET'S GO OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORLD AND SEE WHAT WE THINK THE NEXT CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE. AND STARTED ADDRESS THOSE RISKS. THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED TO SEE WILD FIRES COME UP IN ALL OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES PLANTS SO I THINK THAT WE WE WILL GET BETTER. THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY GET BETTER ANTICIPATE NEW THINGS. HOWEVER WE SPENT FOUR YEARS WORKING WITH THE SCIENTISTS SIC CAL FIRE AND THE FIRE ENGINEERS TO MAP THE FUEL SOURCES HERE IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND TO LOOK AT WHERE THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES ARE AND WE SAW THE AMOUNT OF OF AREAS WERE MAPPED INTO THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS RISE FROM AROUND LAND MASS. SOME OF THAT COMES FROM ADVANCING DROUGHT. SOME OF THAT COMES FROM YEARS OF OF OF OF FORCED IN WILDLAND FIRE MEYER COMMIT MANAGEMENT SOME OF THAT COMES FROM THE PACE AT WHICH PEOPLE ARE. BUILDING NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES SO WE WILL ALWAYS. P. TYING TO KEEP PEACE WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE STATE CHANGES SO IT GOES BACK TO THAT LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY THAT YOU ADDRESS. WILL GET BETTER. BUT WHAT ALWAYS ALWAYS BE SEEING NEW THINGS COMING AT US SOME OF WHICH ARE VERY HARD TO ANTICIPATE NOBODY EXPECTED EVER. SEE THE KINDS OF INTENSE. WINS AND LOW HUMIDITY LOW SOIL MOISTURE HOT TEMPERATURES. THAT WE COULD RESULT IN INTENSE FIRES WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILE WINDS THAT. IS ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT SAFETY IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AT THE P. UC. I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN LEGALLY SAY THAT WE HAVE ANY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY YOU'VE TASKS WITH MANY THINGS BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON AND I KNOW THAT OTHER PEOPLE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON IT I THINK THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY APPROACHING. THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCE THAT WASN'T THERE WHEN I STARTED HAVE YOU WORKED WITH GROUPS LIKE HELLFIRE IN THE MARSHALL OF THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE WHICH A ARE TASKED WITH THIS VERY -- SPECIFIC NEW KNOWLEDGE AND AND EXPERTISE SO FOR EXAMPLE WEEK COMPLETED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL FIRE TO ACTUALLY SHARE INFORMATION OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS WE WORKED WITH WORKING GROUPS WHO WERE CONVENE BY CAL FIRES FIRE SCIENTISTS WE DON'T HAVE. PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND FIRE BEHAVIOR AND FUEL. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO IN IT'S IT'S UNLIKELY THERE WOULD BE A GOOD USE OF OF THE STATE'S AND RATE PAYERS DOLLARS FOR US TO REPLICATE THE SKILL SETS. SO WE'VE BEEN FORMING PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. BECAUSE WE ALL OF A SUDDEN BECAME AWARE. THAT WE DON'T DO WELLS. BUT THERE ARE WELLS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN GAS STORAGE FACILITIES WHERE WE HAVE AUTHORITY PASSED DOWN TO US FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PIPELINE MANAGEMENT WE FORMED A RELATIONSHIP IN MEMORIALIZED IT WITH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL FIRE. SO I KNOW THIS IS A WAY THAT WE TRIED TO DO THAT SO I GUESS TO CUT THROUGH THIS WOULDN'T IT MAKE SENSE. IF THE EXPERTISE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE FIRES HOW TO PREVENT THEM HOW TO WORK WITH THE DIFFERENT UTILITIES AND REQUIRE THAT THEY DEVELOP BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON HOW THE HOW THEY DRESS THE VEGETATION ISSUES -- WE KNOW THAT -- ASEAN CREATED AT THEIR OWN DIRECTION THESE WHETHER CENTERS WHICH ADDRESS PART OF THAT TRIUMVIRATE YOU INDICATED OF WEATHER. AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE THIRD ONE WAS SO -- WILL YOU TELL ME THAT THAT THERE WERE THE THREE THINGS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT IS BEING. THE FUEL THANK YOU THAT THEY HAVE DONE THAT -- OR A BECAUSE YOU KEEP SAYING YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE BEHIND BUT THAT'S NOT IT THAT'S NOT GOING TO STALK THESE FIRES BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE LIABILITY. IS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE THE SARS WITHSO IT WOULD USE AND DO WOULD YOU AGREE THAT OPERATING OFF FROM THE INFORMATION AND EXPERTISE OF OTHERS. WOULD GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO BETTER IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT THESE UTILITIES OR MAYBE DIRECT THAT THESE UTILITIES APPLY THESE BEST PRACTICES IN A PROACTIVE WAY SO THAT WE DON'T KEEP SEEING SO MANY FIRES HAY GROUP YOU A I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE THE PROGRESS OF THE THE WIND -- MODELING HANDS ANEMOMETER SINCE INDIA GO SINCE BEFORE I CAME TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THEY ACTUALLY CAME TO US AND SAID WE WANT TO TRY THIS WILL YOU ALLOW US TO RECOVER THE COST OF ACTUALLY DEPLOYING THESE NEW EXPERIMENTAL. MODELS THAT WE WANT TO DEPLOY. BOTH DIGITIZING THE LANDSCAPE DOING THE NGUYEN MODELING STARTING TO BUILD THE ALGORITHMS FOR RESPONDING. TO YOU LET US DO THAT AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY WATCHED AND LEARNED. IT THE ARROW IS HE DIDN'T LET YOU DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT. IS PART OF THE RATE YES WE DID YOU DID OKAY GET WELL HOW MUCH COURAGE IN THAT FROM SOME OF THE OTHER UTILITIES THAT ARE US AL JUST STARTED THAT PROCESS OF REQUIRING THEM TO ACTUALLY LEARN FROM THAT BUT I WILL TELL YOU. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO WATCH INTO WORM WITH THOSE FOLKS ARE DOING WHO ARE TRYING TO LEARN NEW BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE AT THE TIME NOBODY KNEW WHAT WOULD COME OUT OF IT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN GO TO FRIDAY SPENT BY OFF THE SHELF. AND IT TOOK THEM A LONG TIME TO REALLY PERFECT AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WILL SPEND A LONG TIME ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WOOD DIFFERS IN THE LANDSCAPE TO TAKE COVER SAN DIEGO HAS A RING OF AMOUNTS BEHIND THE CITY? S. E. HAS THE COASTAL RANGE THAT TO HATCH A PIECE IN THE SIERRAS ALL THE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF HOW THE WIND PATTERNS BEHAVE. IN IN TERMS OF FUELS SO I'M I'M TELLING YOU THAT WE WILL BE COME A LEARNING ORGANIZATION. BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TRY THINGS BEFORE YOU KNOW THAT THEY WORK. BY BUT WE DO KNOW THERE WHAT SD GENIE HAS DONE HAS APPEARS TO BE WORKING IN A CERTAINLY ESTABLISHED A LEVEL OF BEST PRACTICE I'M WONDERING. I'M TRYING TO LOOK TO SEE AGAIN THE QUESTION IS PREVENTION THIS JULIE SAVATE UPON. ISRAEL PENSION WEAKENED ACTION TO REQUIRE THOSE OTHER UTILITIES TO DO IT PREVENTION AND SAFETY THAT I THINK IS WHAT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF OUR DISCUSSIONS HERE PREVENTION AND SAFETY. I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WHO'S GOING TO WIN FOR STATE HOW WE GOING TO BE SURE THAT THE UTILITIES. ARE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISH SAYS AND HOW WE CAN ASSURE THAT THEIR MEETING THOSE BEST PRACTICES IS THAT YOUR CHOPPER SHOULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE'S JOB. I HAD TO IT'S A QUESTION. SO. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT NO ONE AGENCY IS GONNA SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS ALONE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO WORK WITHIN THEIR REGIONS. IT'S A USEFUL QUESTION TO TO EXAMINE SHOULD THE STATE HAVE THE KIND OF OVER ARCHING SAFETY AGENCY WHAT WOULD IT DO HOW WILL IT TAKE CARE -- ADVANTAGE TO THE EXPERTISE PACIFIC DIVISIONS WITH SPECIFIC OF PURPOSE I MEAN. I THINK THAT THAT'S A USEFUL DISCUSSION. ALL I KNOW IS THAT FOR THE UTILITIES WE ARE GETTING BETTER STRONGER AND WILL CONTINUE TO GET. HOME MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. SO WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. IF YOU DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S ENOUGH OR IF YOU FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD BE A DIFFERENT MODEL. AGAIN I DEFERRED THE CENTER FOR I COULD IF YOU HAVE A CLOSING THOUGHT ON THAT ON I WANT TO TURN TO CENTER HUESO AND THEN SUMA MEMORYYES. THEY HAD A CERTAINLY I I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS PERHAPS I CAN ASK HIM AT SOME OTHER POINT I DID WANNA JUST THAT THE POINT TO THIS IS THAT. YOU HAVE LIMITED OF RESOURCES YOUR JOB HAS PRIMARILY BEEN TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE RATES -- AYE I THINK AT THIS POINT N TIME SOMEHOW OR OTHER IN GRANTED UTILITIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY FIRE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DO HAVE. A THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE I SUSPECT THE THOMAS FIRE WILL SEE THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME UTILITY ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT IT IS BUT THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD OF GOOD LIKELIHOOD PERHAPS -- SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO TAKE OF THIS SITUATION AND SOMEBODY'SGOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UTILITY COMPANIES. THE ANNA ADOPT BEST PRACTICES AND ARE HELD FEET TO THE FIRE -- WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SURE THAT THEY IMPLEMENT THESE BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE? WHAT HAPPENS IS A COME RUNNING TO THE P. YOU SEE IN ASKING FOR ACCOMMODATIONS O THAT THEY CAN INCREASE RATES BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD THESE INCIDENTS? AND YET IT'S SORT OF LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A THE THE FELLOW WHO KILLS HIS A PARENTS COMING TO COURT AND BEGGING FOR MERCY AT THAT BEFORE THE JUDGE BECAUSE HE'S AN ORPHAN. I MEAN IT'S IT'S A IT'S A SIMILAR SITUATION IT SEEMS TO ME WHEN WE HAVE UTILITY COMPANIES. THAT EITHER AREN'T BEING REQUIRED -- TO MAINTAIN BEST PRACTICES DON'T CONSIDER THEM THAT IMPORTANT MAKE BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT ARE CONTRARY TO BEST PRACTICES AND SO MARK MY QUESTION IS HOWDO WE FIX THAT PROBLEM AND A LOOK FORWARD. TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THAT. THANK YOU PEN PART OF THIS PROCESS WILL ALLOW US TO PUT ADDITIONAL SPOTLIGHT ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'VE RAISED. SENATE HUESO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND JUST FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR COMMENTS I MEAN THAT -- DOT THAT PARTY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION IS GOING TO BE US LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. AND I THINK WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WITHOUT CREATING A NEW AGENCY AND A NEW NEW DIRECTIVE I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY I MEAN WE HAVE THE WE HAVE THE PVC WE HAVE CAL FIRE. WE HAVE -- DID TO DEPARTMENT FORESTRY. WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES OUT THERE TO AT LEAST BEGIN -- A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT LIKE -- PRESIDENT PICKER SAID IT'S CAN REQUIRE EVERYBODY. DOING A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR PART AND JUST JUST TO I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I'M A FULL PLATE BUT IN SAN DIEGO IT JUST WASN'T THE P. YOU SEE AND IT JUST WASN'T S. TEACH YOU NEED. I WAS ON THE COUNCIL BACK THEN AND WE WORKED ON A VERY COMPREHENSIVE BREAST MANAGEMENT. POLICY WITH THE CITY. REQUIRE TO CLEAR -- FUEL AROUND THEIR PROPERTIES AND THAT'S A VERY REASONABLE THING TO ASK OF PEOPLE. TO TAKE PROACTIVE MEASURES TO REDUCE THE RISK IN AROUND THE PROPERTY. THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE. I MEAN TODAY WE'RE DISCUSSING THE MEAT AND POTATOES. I THOUGHT TODAY'S A COMMITTEE HEARING IS REALLY THE MEAT AND POTATOES SUPPORT THIS WHOLE. DEBATE ON AN AND EVERYTHING I THINK THE HE THAT THE PRINCIPLE POLICY THAT WE SHOULD. PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL AND THE GOVERNOR BOTTOMLEY FOR SIGNATURE. IT'S GOING TO COME FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND IT'S GOING TO INVOLVE -- HAVING THE PC DURING THE WORK THAT THEY'RE CONTINUING TO DO WHAT THE WHAT THE PROVIDERS. THAT AT THAT LEVEL. BUT ALSO HAVING. THE COUNTY WORK CHU CHU AND THE AND THE CITY'S WORK [inaudible] TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A LOCAL PROGRAM THAT ON THAT'LL. HOLD PROPERTY OWNERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR CLEARING. THAT STUFF THAT'S ON THEIR PROPERTY IN HOLDING THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR CLEAN THAT THAT'S IN OUR PROP. AND I WAS GONNA ASK YOU KNOW I I'M. I I LOVE THE TO WIRE. THE THE UTILITY UNDERGROUND YOU PROGRAM THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM BUT IT'S MAINLY. AYE A PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES A STATICS REMOVING POWER LINES FROM OF THE THE THE VIEW BUT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM I'M VERY CONCERNED. THAT ANYTHING THAT WE DO HERE'S GONNA HAVE -- AT AN IMPACT OF INCREASING RATES CAN WE CAN WE PRIORITIZE IS IT TOO LATE TO SAY I I WANT TO FOCUS ON SAFETY AND ANYTHING THAT REPAIRS ARE PAIN INTO -- WAY TO REDIRECT AND I DON'T MEAN. USE UNDERGROUND FUNDS SOME SAYING ELIMINATE THAT PROGRAM. BECAUSE IT CREATES A SAVINGS AND THAT SAVINGS -- WE CAN SUBSTITUTE TO CREATE A SAFETY PROGRAM STATEWIDE. THAT IN SOME INSTANCES WHAT WILL RESULT IN AND MAKING INVESTMENTS SUBTLE STRAIGHTEN THE GREATEST AT SOMETHING. THAT WE CAN WORK ON HOW COMPREHENSIVE IS THE UNDERGONE A PER ONLY SPECIFIC AREAS OR IS THAT STATE WIDER. SO. THEY'RE UNDER BRANDING PROGRAM IS REALLY SORT OF A CREDIT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY MATCH AND IT REALLY WAS BUILT AROUND AN AESTHETIC CALL. IT WAS STILL A STATUTE ACTUALLY TIME -- DETERMINES THAT THIS IS NECESSARY FOR PURPOSES OF BEAUTIFICATION IS STARTED OUT AS HIGHWAY BEAUTIFICATION PROGRAM. SO THE UTILITIES ISSUE CREDITS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BASED ON THEIR POPULATION. AND THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL ACCUMULATE THE CREDITS AND IN A MATCH IT WITH THEIR OWN DOLLARS IN WHEN THEY'RE READY TO UNDERGROUND CERTAIN PART OF THE STATE SO HERE IN SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE -- THE CITY WORKED WITH A MUNICIPAL UTILITY TO UNDERGROUND MOST OF THE DOWNTOWN THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF POOL SOME WIRES AROUND STATE CAPITOL -- THERE SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY -- IT IT IS NOT A TRULY DESIGNED TO SAFETY PROGRAM. BUT ALSO SAY THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS EXPENSIVE SO WE THE COSTS RANGE -- FOR UPWARDS OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS DOWN PER MILE FOR UNDER GROUNDING VERSUS. TEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR TOLL INFRASTRUCTURE TO SERVE FOLKS NEEDS. SO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES OF OF WIRES TO ONE POINT FOR FOR ME SHOULD BE FOR ME AND POLLS. THAT'S A FAIRLY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION TO SWITCH OVER ALL OF ONCE SO PEOPLE SHOULD BE VERY JUDICIOUS ABOUT WHERE WE DO THAT WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY A SIGNIFICANT FIRE RISK. AND WHERE THIS IS THE BEST TECHNIQUE SO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON HAS COME FORWARD WITH METAL POLES. STRONGER AND FIRE RESISTANT FOR SOME AREAS AND SO THAT'S SAID A TECHNIQUE THAT THEY'RE USING IT SOME OF THEIR THEIR MORE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS -- IT'S HARD TO UNDO PROGRAM AND AS THAT BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ADD. YOU COULD DO THAT TO THE TABLE I MEAN HAD PUT THAT ON THE TABLE MAKE THAT AS PART OF SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER. IF WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME COST SAVING MEASURES THAT COULD BE IN A COST SAVING MEASURE THAT CAN ALLOW US [inaudible] CHIU. SUBSTITUTE A DIFFERENT FUND RAISING MEASURE THAT WILL HELP US ADDRESS. BOB BRUSH MANAGEMENT. HELP THE COMPANY'S ADDRESS PRESS MANAGEMENT HELP [inaudible] HELP -- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE SOME KIND GRANT PROGRAM IF WE'RE GONNA COME IN IS THE LEGISLATURE TELL THE COUNTIES WE WANT YOU -- TO COME UP WITH A PLAN ON HOW YOU CAN REMOVE THIS BRUSH WE'RE GONNA GO TO CAL FIRE SAY WE NEED YOU. TO IDENTIFY. WHAT DID THAT THE FUEL AREAS ARE AND AND WE WANNA WORK EXPEDITIOUSLY TO REDUCE THAT FUEL WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR TO DO THAT? DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE GOING TO ADD ANOTHER COSTS TO RATEPAYERS AND I'M NOT. I'M NINETY PREACHER PARTICULARLY IN FAVOR OF THAT. UNLESS WE CAN FIND A WAY. TO INJECT SOME SAVINGS INTO THE PROGRAM. AMP AND IT WILL TRULY BEGIN TO PRIORITIZE. SO SENATOR FEW THAT YOU THINK THAT'S VIABLE WE COULD MAKE IT WORK OKAY [inaudible] AND AN I GENERALLY I THINK THE POLICY SHOULD. THAT WE COME UP WITH SHOULD INCLUDE THE COUNTIES TO CITIES. SHOULD INCLUDE CAL FIRE SHOULD INCLUDE INCLUDE THE FORESTRY DEPARTMENT IF WE'RE GOING TO BEAT. DEVELOP I MEAN EVEN EVEN THE LUMBER INDUSTRY. IF IF WORK CUTTEN DOWN -- WOULD THAT'S USABLE. WHY NOT? WHY NOT PROVIDE THAT TO THE MILLS SAYS A SOURCE OF? BUT WHERE WHERE WE CAN -- ENOUGH SEND THE STUFF. OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BIOMASS. BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT ENOUGH BIOMASS PLANTS. TO TO CONSUME ALL OF THIS MATERIAL AND NOT ALL OF IT NEEDS TO BE BURNED OR PROCESSED WE COULDN'T. FIND DIFFERENT WAYS. TO MOLD SHARED OR TURNED INTO LUMBER OR TURN IT INTO -- BIOMASS FUEL [inaudible] BUT SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE DONE THAT ON A VERY. COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE SCALE. UNPRECEDENTED I WOULD SAY. AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE US TO TO WE LOOK AT OUR PRIORITIES AND SAY WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT. GIVEN THAT WE'RE LOSING OUR STATE'S PRIMARY LUNG. AND I MEAN. THE PRESIDENT SAID CUT DOWN THE FOREST CONSISTS ARE SO FEW. I DON'T THINK HE MEANT THAT BUT BUT IT SCARES ME. IT SCARES ME THAT PEOPLE BEGIN THAT THINK THAT IT'S A VIABLE PLAN IT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY. OFF THE TABLE IT'S IT'S VERY SCARY TO PONDER THAT WE'RE GONNA CUT OUR FORCE DOWN -- CUT OFF OUR NOSE TO SPITE OUR FACE IN YOU KNOW DESPITE HER FACE I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT YOU NO ANYWAY. I WANTED TO ADD THOSE BECAUSE I THINK. IF WE'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH A POLICY IT'S GONNA IT'S IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE. IT'S IT'S GONNA REQUIRE MULTIPLE. PARTNERS THE UTILITIES. BUT THE COMMUNITIES THAT. THE I USE. THE COUNTIES TO CITIES CAL FIRE AT THE STATE. ANYWAY THANK YOU MISTER SUMMARY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. RESIDENT PICKER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. AND THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO MEET WITH MANY OF US ON A PERSONAL BASIS TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHAT IT WOULD OUR TASK IS HERE? WITHOUT A DOUBT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED TIME TO COME UP WITH A PLAN WITH A PROPOSAL WITH THE AMENDMENTS. TO S. B. NINE OH ONE WE HAVE THE FINITE TIME. AND LOTS OF WHAT WE HEAR IS IMPORTANT. THE OTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. WHAT -- ROAD AT THE LAST HEARING -- MISTER DALI MISTER WOOD TALKED ABOUT THE VICTIMS THAT HOUSE TO BE OUR NUMBER ONE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO MAKE OUR VICTIMS HOLD. THE ALREADY SUFFERED AND WE CANNOT BE PLAYING AROUND WITH WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH WHAT THE RULES WERE ALREADY. WE HAVE TO MAKE ARE VICTIMS HOLE NUMBER. ONE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PREVENT THESE WILD OF THESE FIRES. FROM STARTING IN THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GROW IF THEY DO START. BUT SAFETY WE TALKED ABOUT SAFETY IT'S EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT THE COST. I DON'T THINK THAT -- AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE HERE BUT A LOT OF THAT THAT THAT THAT THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN AROUND THE COST. TO TO TO TO THE UTILITIES. THAT CANNOT BE OUR FIRST DISCUSSION. ARE THOSE THE SENATOR ISA GOOD SENATOR HILL IS INDICATED WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO STOP THESE FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. AND PICKED UP THE LAST HEARING IN THEM DEED NOW HERE FOR THE SECOND HEARING. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PLAN IS GOING TO BE IF WE ALREADY KNOW THAT I IT THEM SAN DIEGO. PUT THE PLAN TOGETHER THEY TESTIFIED IT WAS A ONE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. AND YOU'RE RIGHT NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT IT WAS A TEN YEAR. PERIOD. SO THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TEN YEARS AGO AND BEEN WORKING ON IT INVESTING. YOU AUTHORIZE THEM TO TO TO CHARGE THE RATE PAYERS TO SO THAT THEY CAN PUT THIS PLAN TOGETHER. WHY AREN'T THE OTHER UTILITIES LOOKING AT THIS? WIRED THINK FIGURING OUT HOW THEY INVEST THEIR MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR RATE PAYERS. ARE SAFE. THAT IS OF GREAT GREAT CONCERN TO ME. I THINK THAT THAT DOES IT IS IT WHEN I LOOK AT THE PLAN THAT -- BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE THE VERY FIRST ONE ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANNING. TIS UTILITY SUBMIT FIRE PREVENTION PLANS. IS ARE GOING TO BE A BASE BEFORE THEY SUBMIT THEIR PLAN. BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU THROUGH THE WORD WERE NOT SAYING I'M NOT SAYING THIS IN A CYNICAL WAY JUST TRYING TO BE A REALIST. IF I'M GOING TO POLICE MYSELF I'M NOT GOING TO PUT THE STANDARD THE VERY HIGHEST GOING TO SAY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE LEAST AMOUNT. THEN YOU TELL ME WHAT MORE I NEED TO DO BUT IS THERE GOING TO BE A BASE WHEN WE ASK UTILITIES PUT TOGETHER YOUR FIRE PREVENTION PLAN. ARE THEY GOING TO BE GIVEN A BASS AND TOLD THIS IS FOR YOU BEGAN AND TELL US EXACTLY HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT OR WERE GOING TO SAY. PUT TOGETHER A PLAN. WHAT WHAT DO YOU ENVISION? THEY OWN THE WE KNOW HOW TO BE LOOKING AT THE PLANS AND ARE ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE TO PUT MORE SPECIFIC. OH OH IT THE TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE WE WOULD LIKE WELL FOR THE% PLANS TO BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE. IN THE UTILITY PLANS ARE VERY DETAILED TO EACH ONE OF THE ALL. HOUSE WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANS AND HAS BEEN INVESTING IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION I KNOW WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT -- IS D. GENIES SOLUTION AND THEY DO HAVE SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED OF PLAYER CAPABILITIES IN ONE VERY SPECIFIC AREA AROUND OH WEATHER PREDICTION. ALMOST BLADES THE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE THAT CAPABILITY IT BOTH OF THE CSE E. AND P. JEANNIE -- IN INVESTING WHETHER ANALYTICS AS WELL THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE EXTENSIVE -- NETWORK OF WEATHER STATIONS LIKE. WELL BUT I KNOW THERE ARE ALSO OTHER. AREAS THAT UTILITIES FOCUS ON FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE VEGETATION AND THE CHALLENGES THAT P. JEANNIE FACES A VERY VERY DIFFERENT AND FROM CHALLENGES INSANE GAO. SO HOME REPLICATING THE EXACT THIS IT SEEMED YOU GO SOLUTION ALL OVER THE STATE DOESN'T NECESSARILY THE ANSWER AND THAT'S THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE WORK ON IN MY GROUP. IS REALLY ON THE STANDING THE SPECIFICS OF DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS OF WHAT THE UTILITIES ARE DOING AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AND HELPING THEM THESE CONVERSATIONS TO SAY QUE. LIKE LET'S DISCUSS WHAT BE WHAT THINGS YOU GOOD THAT HERE WHY IT WOULD IT WOULDN'T WORK IN P. GENIUS OR IS SEIZE TERRITORY CALLED YOU TWEAK IT TO MAKE IT WORK. HOME SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK ABOUT THE GOES ALL I ASK YOU FIRST I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND I WOULD NEVER. IMPLY THAT WHATEVER WORKS IN SAN DIEGO IS GOING TO WORK IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT I WOULD EXPECT THAT IF DAD IS MY BUSINESS. I WILL BECOME THE EXPERT AND I WILL SEE WHAT WORKS IN SAN DIEGO AND IF IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WHY AM I GOING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL WHEN SOMEBODY'S ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS. FIGURED OUT WHAT WORKS THE CAME OUT THAT'S LIKE A WORK IN THIS AREA SO WHERE DO WE TWEAK IT. IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL WHO'S DOING IT IRWIN IS A BEING OF THE THAT THE GUTS OF THE FIRE SAFETY PLANS WITH THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT STANDARD THAT WE ADOPTED. WE HAVE OTHER PIECES THAT WE WE CONSTANTLY MONITOR -- IN TERMS OF ADVANCING -- CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE SAFETY IN OUR GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE RELATING TO OVERHEAD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR POLLS. WE HAVE A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU BRING IT TOGETHER IN A WAY. THAT ACTUALLY CONTINUES TO ADVANCE YEAR TO YEAR HOW DO WE ACTUALLY COM SET THAT FRAMEWORK WHO ARE THE RULES BUT SEE IT COME TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT WE ALL KNOW ROYCE HALL WORKING TOGETHER TO PREVENT FIRES. THE GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE FOR OVERHEAD SO AS A LOT OF IMPORTANCE OUT OF FIRE HAZARD AREAS. SO IT'S A QUESTION HOW DO HOW DO WE REALLY USE THAT ADAPT THAT IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREA SOON AND ENDEAVOR BEEN AREAS WE USE THAT PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THINGS LIKE TREE MANAGEMENT FOR ELECTROCUTION. WE DO THAT TO PREVENT THE LINE DROPS IT THEY CAN SOMETIMES IT ACT LIKE TO KEEP PROPERTY OWNERS. SO THERE THE I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO LOOK AT THE AREAS WHERE ALL THESE THINGS COME TOGETHER AROUND FIRE HAZARDS. IAN WHERE ELSE CAN WE BEGIN TO LEARN AS WE START TO SEE HOW IT WORKS TOGETHER. AND THAT THAT'S A GOOD TO BE THE CORE OF THE FIRST ROUNDS OF THE THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLANS. FURTHERMORE AS WE BRING EVALUATORS AND AND THEY START TO REPLICATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UTILITIES IS THEY BRING THINGS FORWARD. WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE LEVELS I'M I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF SAYING THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT. MIKE BY I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSTANTLY LEARN AND TO ADVANCE SO THAT A RULE DOESN'T BECOME A CEILING IT'S THE FLOOR. WE WILL START. WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT WE WILL GET BETTER? AND IF MY LAST QUESTION COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GOES BACK TO CENTER WHICH WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THE UNDERGROUND -- INFRASTRUCTURE. I RECOGNIZE HOME HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS. THAT IS WHEN WE HAVE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE INCLUDED SO THAT pINFRASTRUCTURE IS SET UP. SO IT IS GENERALLY BECOMING COMMON PRACTICE AND IN LAND USE IN IN AN URBAN COURSE JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HAVING POLLS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SO FILL YOU GO OUT TO NORTH NOTONOMUS HE'LL SEE THAT MOST OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS HAVE UNDERGROUND IT EMPHASIS. HOLDER NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE SOUTH OF TOMAS BECAUSE THE DEVELOPERS WERE SMALLER THEY DIDN'TDO MASTER PLAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES. ARE YOU TO HAVE MORE POLLS SO I THINK THAT'S THE TREND IT'S LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF SMALL DEVELOPMENTS. SPENDING INTO THE WILD DUH LEANDER BEEN INTERFACE -- WHERE YOU HAVE FIRE HAZARD TO WHERE IT'S ONLY TWO TO THREE BUILDINGS TOGETHER ONE INDIVIDUAL WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE ACTRESS CITY? PRINT AND SO THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO THE UNDER GROUNDING ON THEIR OWN. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MASTER PLAN DEVELOPER TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHY TALK ABOUT NEW DEVELOPMENTS SO NEW DEVELOPMENTS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO PROBABLY BE CLOSER AND ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF MASTER PLAN DEVELOPMENTS IN HIGH HAZARD AREAS -- I SUSPECT WE'LL SEE THAT HOWEVER THEY ARE GOING TO FACE THEIR OWN CHALLENGES AS THEY DO THAT AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN REQUIRE THEM TO DO THAT THAT'S A LOCAL LAND USE PREROGATIVE -- ONE IF YOU PUT IT UNDERGROUND IF YOU HAVE TO REPAIR IT IT COSTS MORE AND TAKES LONGER TO FIX THE EXPERIENCING HURRICANE SANDY IS YOU CAN GET COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE POOLS AND WIRES ABOVE GROUND. COULD BE BACK IN SERVICE IN A WEEK [inaudible] ON AVERAGE. AND HURRICANE SANDY THAT COMMUNITIES THERE WERE UNDERGROUND THE AVERAGE IS MORE LIKE THREE MONTHS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE PARTICULARLY WITHOUT SMART METERS TO PINPOINT THE BREAK. YOU HAVE TO DIG UP A LOT. TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PROBLEM IS FOR YOU GET SMART METERS HE HAD SMART METERS BICU THAT STILL DOES NOT. MEAN THAT YOU GET EVERYBODY BACK IN SERVICE QUICKLY. TO AS WE SEE INNOVATION AND WE SEE FIVE G. COMING INTO THE MARKETPLACE AND PEOPLE WANT THAT BROADBAND THROUGH ITS -- THAT'S THAT'S NOT TIED TO LOCATION. YOU GOTTA HAVE POLLS ABOVE GROUND. SO DOES CONTAIN COMMUNITIES ARE LIKELY TO NOT. CHOOSE UNDERGROUND A BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE THOSE POLLS FOR FIVE G.. HERE WE HAVE TO HAVE A BROADCAST. THE MEANS GOOD BE ABOVE GROUND. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE FIBER TO BE ABLE TO CARRY THE HIGH LEVELS OF OF DATA THAT PEOPLE ARE BROADCASTING. IN YOUR HAVE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY TO TO POWER THE BROADCAST. SO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO CHOOSE TO UNDERGROUND MAY BE GOING FOR GOING ON FIVE G. BROADBAND THANK YOU [inaudible] THE PSEUDO. TO USE CHAIRMAN. AND SO I'M LOOKING AT THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN RISK ASSESSMENT RATE MAKING ENFORCEMENT SO THE FIRST COLUMN IS. WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANNING SO. CAL FIRE WHO USED TO BE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY. TO THOSE FORESTERS THAT ARE INSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. POLITICALLY LIEU CITED OUT SOMETIMES TO THEY'RE BASICALLY WORKING WITH. YOU ALL AND THE UTILITY TO COME UP WITH A RISK ASSESSMENT IN A PLAN THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. SO THAT'S THE FIRST COLUMN. THE SECOND HOMES THEN YOU SOMEBODY SS IS HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST. AND THEN YOU PASS THAT RATE. BONTA THE RATE PAYER AND THE UTILITIES ABLE TO THEN PRECOOKED THEIR COST TO DO THIS PLAN. IN THE THIRD COLUMN IS COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. SO WHEN A UTILITY DOES NOT IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. WHAT KIND OF ACTION HAPPENS THEN? OR HAS THAT NEVER HAPPENED. NO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT OF THE OTHER STUFF I LEFT IN YOUR OFFICE THE IT IS THE THE ANSWERS TO SENATOR DODD'S QUESTIONS WE ACTUALLY DETAIL SOME OF THE MAJOR FINDS THAT WE'VE GIVEN FOR FAILURE -- TO PREVENT FIRES SO THREE OF THOSE ARE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITIES FOUR OF THEM ARE FOR TELECOM PROVIDERS -- THEY ARE FINE STAY ARE WHAT HOW WE ACTUALLY TRY TO DRIVE THE SOUTH. NOW THERE'S THE QUESTION WHAT D YOU DO WITH THINGS THAT DON'T RESULT IN SOME KIND OF HARM. THE THAT DATED DAY VIOLATIONS THE THE FIX IT TICKETS AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING IN WORKING TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE AND SO WE ACTUALLY DETAILED SOME OF THE PROGRAM SO WE HAD. TO BUILD A TRUE. ESCALATING ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AT THE CPUC INNARAL OUR LETTER TO TO SENATOR DIED I THINK THE AREA THAT IS GOING TO ALWAYS BE PROBLEMATIC IS THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL. ABILITY TO COMPLY -- COULD FORCE COMPLIANCE. FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE WATER YOU A UTILITIES WERE WE PAY WE AND THE GAS UTILITIES WILL HAVE THE FULL BOAT OF RATE MAKING. AND WE CAN APPLY THAT LESS SO FOR THE TELECOM FROM MINORS WHO ARE ALSO IN THAT POLL WHO ALSO SOMETIMES CONTRIBUTE TO FIRES. SO WHAT HAT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS REAL [inaudible] CRIMINAL. ENFORCEMENT POWERS WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO TO THE COURTS WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITHIN OUR OWN SYSTEM FOR THE MOST PART. IT IT BE SAFE TO SAY THAT. MAY RECOUP THE THEY'VE BEEN PAID TO DO THE WORK SO THE INVESTOR. IS REAPING THE BENEFIT OF THAT RATE THAT WAS SET TO GO DO THE WORK AND THE WORK NEVER GOT DONE. AND THERE WAS NO. A IT WAS A FIX IT TAKE IT THEY'RE STILL RECOUPING THAT COST AND SO IT WEARS THE INVESTOR ON THE HOOK -- FOR SAYS THERE ARE -- TWO COMPONENTS TO THIS THE ONE THERE ARE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ANDY A METHODOLOGY IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET SILLY IS SPENDING THE MONEY ON SAFETY. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED AND IF THE DOME AND OF SPENDING THAT MONEY WELL THAT GETS FLAGGED IN THE IN THE WAY THAT THE RATE MAKING WORKS IS ACTUALLY NO ABILITY FOR THEM -- TO TO EARN THE RATE OF RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT THAT THEY SERVED IN MACON SAFETY AT ALL SO THERE IS A GREAT MAKING COMPONENT AUDITS THE COST TO MAKE SURE THAT MONEY IS GOING WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOING AND FLAGGING AND IF IT IS AND AND THEN THERE'S THE SECONDARY. COMPONENT GOLF. SO WITH THE RULES AND STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE SHE COULD SPEND ALL THE MONEY THAT YOU WEREALLOCATED THE STILL BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE OR VICE VERSA YOU COULD THEORETICALLY BE IN COMPLIANCE AND NOT HAVE SPENT THE MONEY RATES OF BOTH OF THOSE. SITUATIONS COULD THEORETICALLY HAPPEN SO WE HAVE THE FROM PROGRAMS THAT ARE THE COST SIDE AND THEN THE NOTE PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON THE DOG COMPLIANCE OF THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAKING SURE THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED MAINTAINED. IN ACCORDING CALM IN ACCORDING TO COATS. SO JUST TO GO WILL DEEPER WHEN WE FIND A UTILITY FOR FAILING TO DO SOMETHING WORK CAUSING HARM. THAT GOES TO THE GENERAL FUND INCOMES FROM SHAREHOLDERS GENERALLY. BUT IT DOESN'T GO BACK TO ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE INFRASTRUCTURE HE GOES TO THE GENERAL FUND. SO I I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M. HEARING WHAT I THINK YOU SAID SO [inaudible] THERE. IF THEY'VE DONE THE WORK YOU GO OUT AND CHECK SOME A CHECKS TO SEE IF THE WORK'S BEEN DONE AND IF THERE IS BEEN. MORE [inaudible] RECEIVED. THEN COSTS CAN YOU'RE ALSO YOU'RE ALSO REVIEWING THE COST AT THE SAME TIME IS THAT CORRECT SO. DEPENDING UPON THE PROGRAM WE HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS REMINDED YOUR SPECIFIC FUNDS IN EXPENDITURES TO SEE WHETHER IT ACTUALLY DID COSTS THAT. SOMETIMES THOUGH WILL DO SOME PLANNING. WHICH IS THE RATE CASE -- AND LOOK AHEAD AND SAY THEY THINK IT'S GONNA COST THIS MUCH EVERYBODY BEATS UP THOSE NUMBERS AND THERE'S AN AGREEMENT ON A PRICE PER WILL SAY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU TRACK THAT IN A SPECIFIC KIND OF AN ACCOUNT AND THEN IN IN THE YEAR TWO OR THREE YEARS WILL HOW WILL HAVE A LOOK AT THAT ACCOUNT TO SEE WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY COSTA. AND THEN IF IT DIDN'T COST THAT MUCH THAT WE TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR NEXT BUDGET. SO THERE'S AND THOSE KINDS OF TRACKING. THAT THE THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE DON'T GO OUT AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING THE UTILITIES. TO THAT'S WHAT I THINK -- THE SPELL SHINKO WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN SHE SAID THE LABOR FORCE WHERE HE ECONOMIC REGULATOR SO WE TEND TO USE AUDITS A LOT. SO I TAX AGENCIES DON'T GO AND CHECK YOUR BANK BOOK EVERY EVERY MONTH TO SEE THE YEAR ACTUALLY. PUTTING MONEY ASIDE PAY YOUR TAXES TO DO IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND FRANKLY SOMETIMES THEY'LL GO BACK TO HOT IT. AND SO WE USED THAT AS A TOOL TO GENERALLY SEND THE MESSAGE WE MAY BE CHECKING DON'T MESS AROUND AND WILL WE CATCH HIM THEN THAT'S A PROBLEM. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE SYSTEMS AND PLACES ANIE OTHER AUDITOR THEN WE REALLY START TO TRIED TO DIAL DOWN THAT'S THE CORE THING DO YOU HAVE THE TRACKING SYSTEMS. TO SHOW US THE U. INTERNALLY KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING THE THINGS. CAN WE SEE THAT THOSE TRACKING SYSTEMS THOSE THOSE THOSE CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE. CAN WE ACTUALLY THEN GO AND DO SPOT CHECKS BECAUSE THAT'S A MORE EFFICIENT WAY GENERALLY. NOW THE QUESTION IS. DO WE GO FURTHER THAN THAT AND START TO USE PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND WALK THE LINE AS WE DO IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY WE WALK EVERY FOOT OF TRACK TO IT EVERY YEAR. OR DO WE CADETS A VERY TRADITIONAL WAY OR TO USE TECHNOLOGY WE COULD BE USING TECHNOLOGY IN THE RAIL INDUSTRY TO DO THAT FASTER AND PROBABLY BETTER. BUT THAT'S NOT. WHAT WE WHAT WE DO? THAT WE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING FEDERAL GUIDELINES. HERE ARE QUESTION IS SHOULD ARE WE GONNA START TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY CAPACITY. TO DO THIS THROUGH BIG DATA THROUGH -- THROUGH -- DRONES IN LIGHT ARE TO BE ABLE TO GO MONITOR AND TO HAVE THAT MORE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE IS THERE. I HEAR YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO I NOT TO GET. COMPLETED AND JUST PAY A FINE AND THE ROOM AND THE INVESTOR BENEFITS THE HARVEST OF THAT. I I I DON'T SEE THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY COME FROM AN AGENCY THAT DID NOT -- EFFECTIVELY MONITOR YOU KNOW ALL THOSE THE GAS PIPELINE INCIDENT AND P. GENIES -- SYSTEM AND WE WENT BACK AND SPENT A LOT OF TIME AUDITING SOME PLACES WE FOUND THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE CONTROLS IN PLACE AND WE DON'T CATCH IT BEFORE. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE WORKING REALLY HARD. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN BUT WHICH COULD TAKE ITS TIME FOR ME TO ACTUALLY SIT HERE AND TELL YOU THAT I THINK WERE THERE. I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT TO MISLEAD YOU ADELINE I OVERSTATE THE CASE BUT I THINK WE GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO DO [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MAYES. THANK YOU OFFER FOR BEING HERE AND THAT TAKING SOME THEM SOME THAT IT COULD QUESTIONS ROUND AND ENJOYING A LISTEN TO SOME OF THE RESPONSE. TO THEM WE'VE HAD MANY ARE CONVERSATIONS SOME OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A HANDFUL OF US THEM WORKING ON THIS. AS SINCE JANUARY -- THEN YOU'RE RIGHT THE IT HAS GONE FROM THE DEALING WITH INVERSE CONDEMNATION -- TO THAT NOW -- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE OF THE IMPACT OF OF WILDFIRES ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE. TO WANT TALK A LITTLE BIT IF I CAN ABOUT THE IN WITH INSURANCE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A QUESTION THAT HAVE BEEN POSED -- TO YOU -- THE BUT IN REGARDS TO YOUR ROLE THE PC'S ROLE MARIE IT IT AND INTENT ESTABLISHING WHAT TYPE OF OF LIABILITY. INSURANCE AT THAT DE I USE SHOULD HAVE A MAN IN REGARDS TO ALSO A RECOVERING OF THOSE COSTS AS WELL. TWO WE DON'T GENERALLY REQUIRE LEVELS OF INSURANCE BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THE UTILITY HAVE TO ENSURE AND IT'S A GOOD IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE TO KNOW WHETHER THEY HAVE ENOUGH COVERAGE. WHAT WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING IN AND IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF FIRE IS HE CAN'T GET INSURANCE? SO WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT LEVEL WE SAT [inaudible] THE CAMPFIRE. AND SO THAT'S PARTIALLY A HAY QUE OUTCOME OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY STARTING TO LOOK AT THEIR RISK IN THE FACE OF ADVANCING CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THEY LOOK AT TEN YEARS OF DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY BEEN BACKING OFF ON THEIR COVERAGE. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S ITS A TACIT ADMISSION. THAT WE PROBABLY HAVE TO START LOOKING TO DIFFERENT MODELS BECAUSE IT'S ALSO TRUE. THAT THOSE SAME INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN LOOKIN AT AND OTHER AND AND SOME OF THE THE RETAIL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE FIRE MAPS AND SAYING. WELL HOLY COW. ARE WE GONNA START TO TO AREAS THAT WE NOW KNOW OUR EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS. AND SHOULD WE JUST GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS IS SIMILAR TO THE TO THE POSITION THAT THEY TOOK AFTER THE LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE. WHEN MANY OF THE RETAIL INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO SERVED HOMEOWNERS IN COMMERCIAL AND EVEN INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS? JUST DECIDED THEY WERE NOT GOING TO WRITE MORE POLICIES THAT COVER EARTHQUAKE RISK HEARING CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK THAT THAT HARM IF WE DID SET STANDARDS IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY CAN GET IT. OR IF THEY DO GET IT IS GOING TO BE SO EXPENSIVE THAT WE MIGHT JUST SAY THAT WERE YOU PROBABLY BETTER OFF SELF INSURING. SO HOW DO WE EVERY BUSINESS HAS GENERAL LIABILITYINSURANCE EVERY BUSINESS DOES. AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE I'LL USE AND THE APPEAL USES THAT THE PTO USE WHICH YOU GUYS DOWN FOUND THE DON'T REGULATE% RELEASED THEM TO VERY LITTLE EXTENT IF YOU DO. THE P. YOU USE ARE ABLE TO US TO TO JUST RATES TO BE ABLE TO FACTOR FOR THAT THAT LIABILITY. THE I'LL USE ARE NOT ABLE. TO DO THAT SO IF THEY CAN'T GET LIABILITY INSURANCE. TO BE ABLE TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS AND TO PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY BOMB TO THEIR CREDITORS. I'M. AT WE GELLED OUT WITH ON THE STATE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE FIRST PAYER. AND RIGHT THE RIGHT TO CHECK FOR A 100% OF THE OF THE COST WHEN THERE MIGHT ONLY BE 1% OR 5%. I'M LIABLE THAT THE SEAT DOESN'T SEEM TO GEL TO ME WELL I WOULDN'T ARGUE THAT IT DOES IT DOESN'T SEEM TO GEL TO THE TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THESE UTILITIES DON'T RUN. ON THEIR CASH RECEIPTS THEY BORROW A LOT FOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOMETIMES FOR OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE COLLECTING IN SMALL AMOUNTS SO IF THEY HAVE TO PUT IN NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE TO PUT IN NEW. SYSTEMS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO CAPITAL MARKETS EITHER BONDS OR THROUGH SELLING SHARES TO BE ABLE TO GET THE CASH THEY NEED THEM. F. THOSE CAPITAL MARKETS START TO SEE THAT AS THE FIRST PAY YOUR WHICH IS WHAT THE COURTS DECIDED THAT -- UTILITY SHOULD BE YOU HAVE. ANY ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEN YOU HAVE TO BE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO PAY IT'S NOT. NECESSARILY A A A JUDGMENT OF NEGLECT IT WAS THE COURTS WAY OF AVOIDING HAVING. TO DEAL WITH ALL THOSE CLAIMS AND THAT WAS INVERSE CONDEMNATIONS CALIFORNIA WHO HER LAST TIME. CALIFORNIA IN ALABAMA ARE THE ONLY TWO STATES TO USE THAT. SO THE CAPITAL MARKETS ARE LOOKING AT THIS THEY'RE SAYING WELL THESE GUYS MAY HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF CLAIMS. AND THEY MIGHT HAVE TO THEN. PULL BACK CASH FROM OTHER THINGS INCLUDING PAYING SHARES THE YOU KNOW GOD HELP US IF THEY MISTER BOND PAYMENT. BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE. A UNWILLINGNESS TO INVEST. ANNIE AND CALIFORNIA UTILITIES THEY MAY ACTUALLY GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS CLIMATE IS IS IN DISARRAY. AND DECIDE NOT TO INVEST ELSEWHERE I'D THAT'S THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN MARKETS GET NERVOUS -- WHEN YOU ADD TO THAT AGAIN THE FACT THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE DEPARTING FROM THIS MARKET? AND HALL THAT FALLS ON THE UTILITIES. I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU SEE A LOT OF OF INVESTORS REALLY DO THIS DISCONCERTED ABOUT WHAT'S TAKING PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I DON'T TALK TO THOSE INVESTORS WITH THE LEGISLATURE COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IS PART OF THE REFORMS FOR THE P. YOU SEE. CLAIRE THAT THOSE INVESTORS ARE NOW ON PARTY'S. IN OUR PROCEEDINGS SO TO TALK TO THEM THEN TRIGGERS ALL OF THE EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS. SO I JUST MADE THE PERSONAL ASSESSMENT THAT I WOULDN'T TALK TO THEM SO I DON'T HAVE REAL CONFIRMATION OF WHAT THEY'RE THINKING I CAN ONLY LOOK AT THEIR PUBLISHED REPORTS. OF HOW THEY LOOK AT THE CREDIT OF THESE UTILITIES. SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE IF IT AFFECTS THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THEY HAVE TO HEAR GOING TO HIT A A CASH SHORTFALL AT SOME POINT. THEY MAY COME TO US AND SAY OKAY YOU'VE GIVEN US DIRECTION TO SPEND THIS MUCH MONEY ON ELECTRIFICATION A TRANSPORTATION THIS MUCH MONEY ON BIOMASS FACILITIES THIS MUCH MONEY. ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE DON'T HAVE THE CASH AVAILABLE. TO DO ALL OF THAT WHAT'S THE PRIORITY. SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE WILL FACE. I TEND TO NOT THINK THAT THERE WILL BE BANKRUPTCIES AND CERTAINLY NOT SOON. BUT I DO SEE IMPAIRMENT TO CREDIT RATING AND I'VE BEEN A BILL YOU DO CAPITAL FORMATION AND POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME OF THE COMMITMENTS THEY MET THEY MADE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT PERSON TO ASK THIS QUESTION OF BUT I'M. HE DID I USED TO THEIR CREDIT RATINGS HAVE HAVE DROPPED WHICH IS CREATED THIS BIT OF UP A BIT OF A CRISIS BECAUSE MANYOF THEM WERE JUST ABOVE. A JUNK BOND STATUS IS THAT AS MUCH REVIEW IF I COULD I YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING IS SUSAN WHOSE SOUND VERY MUCH IMPORTANT AND IT GOES TO A LOT OF THE HEART OF WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DEAL WITH -- HOWEVER IN THIS PARTICULAR AGENDA WE'RE GONNA TRY AND I KINDA LET GO A LITTLE BIT SO THAT THERE COULD BE AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THIS IS A REALLY SIMPLE AND I'M MISTER CHAIR JUST A MINUTE COULD BE BILLY BUT A YES OR NO ANSWER. I'M JUST IN REGARDS TO WHETHER THE P. SAME IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE VALUES HAVE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE AWARE THAT WE NEED NOT YET I MEAN IT MAY HAPPEN I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT THEM CAREFULLY A WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT PLACE TO WATCH THAT PRETTY CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO SAVE GETTING CHEAP AND LOANS BUT IN OUT I HAVEN'T SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON IT LATELY SO GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU ARE WE'RE GOING TO TO SHIFT NOW WE DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND SUPPLYING ANSWERS TO THE THE QUESTIONS THAT -- CERTAINLY -- ARE OR TRYING TO GET AT SOME REAL ISSUES AS IT RELATES. TO THE URGENCY AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS A PLANNING PROCESS AND WE'RE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY LOOK AT ISSUES THAT MAY GO BEYOND SORT OF THE MORE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN BUT CERTAINLY ON SAFETY. THERE ARE A SOME VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSES THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET AND WE DO HAVE -- DETAILED A FULL OF QUESTIONS ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS THAT THE SENATOR PUT FORTH AT THE LAST MEETING AND SO WILL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY. LOOK TO HAVE YOU COME BACK AGAIN IF WE NEED TO TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ON SOME OF THE REMAINING -- AREAS OF INTEREST AND CONCERN ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHIFT NOW IF WE COULD. GO TO OUR NEXT PANEL IN THIS KIND OF GOES TO THE MITIGATION PLANS AND A LOT OF IT WAS BEING PUT BEFORE YOU AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT TO TRY TO GET THROUGH THAT NOW -- SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO AYE ARE YOU PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLANS. NOW THIS MAY CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS TO SORT OF GO BACK TO SOME OF THE THE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING POSED. TO THIS PANEL AND WITH THAT WE THINK YOU AND THEY WILL WELCOME OUR NEXT PANEL ALTERNATE OVER TO SENATOR DODD. I THINK YOU. COLLISON BICU ON ITS BACK DO. SKINNER COULD TAKE WE GET THE NEXT PANEL THAT'S COMING UP FILL HARRINGTON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR ITS MISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -- KEVIN DOSSO VICE PRESIDENT. ELECTRIC ASSET MANAGEMENT PGA NEED DAVE. DIRE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC AND MARK JUST OF ATTORNEY COALITION CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES. LOOK IF WE GO THE SAME RATE THAT WE DID ON THAT FIRST PANEL -- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO START OUR LAST PANEL FIVE THIRTY I'M TO BE DONE HERE WE ARE TO BE DONE? CO CHAIR AND I TALK ABOUT THIS AT FIVE O'CLOCK. SO -- I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU EACH FIVE MINUTES IF WE NEED MORE DETAIL THAN THAT -- WILL ASK YOU -- YOU NOTE SPECIFIC FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS TURNED OUT. WHO'S GOING TO START. THEY GETS ITS FILL VERY DID GET SENT. THE CHAIRMAN I WILL LEAD OFF AND NOW GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DODD I JOIN HOPE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. BOB FIRST OF ALL WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT A WHILE FIRE MITIGATION STRATEGIES. WITH PROBLEM AS YOU KNOW THE NEW NORMAL WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. ON ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- THE IMPACT IS VISIBLE IN WILDFIRES SUTTON CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR AS WELL AS LAST YEAR -- AND AS I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT -- THERE'S A NUMBER SO GIVING WILDFIRES ACTIVELY BURNING IN OUR STATE. AND UP ON THAT NO DOUBT I WILL LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFORTS OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS NOT OUR EMPLOYEES AYE INCLUDING LINEMAN FROM IBEW TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT IT. OUT TO THESE EVENTS WITHIN OUR TERRITORY AND AT THIS MOMENT -- IMPEACHING THE SERVICE TERRITORY TO ME DELAYED. I I WANNA BE CLEAR ON ONE POINT HERE -- SCE'S LASER FOCUSED ON ITS ENHANCE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION STRATEGY -- WHICH BUILDS UPON OUR EXISTING HOW WELFARE PROGRAMS. HOW THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND EMPLOYEES ARE TOP PRIORITY AYE AND DEMANDS NO LESS? BUT IN THE FOLLOWING PRESENTATION WILL SHARE WITH YOU AND I DO HAVE A SLIDE DECK I'LL BE REFERRING TO APPEAR OUT AGREE TO THIS A PUPPY DOWN FOUR MINUTES NOW -- THE DISCUSSION -- ON THE WELFARE MITIGATION EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERWAY AND HIGHLIGHT AREAS WERE RISING TO THE CHALLENGE OF THIS NEW OPERATIONAL BEFORE SYSTEM. I'M NOT BEFORE LAST YEAR'S WILDFIRE HIGH NORTHERN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS HE ALREADY HAD OPERATIONAL PRACTICES IN PLACE TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK DURING EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS -- OVER THE YEARS WE'VE ADOPTED AREA COMPREHENSIVE WELFARE MITIGATION PROGRAM A COMPRISES THREE MAIN ELEMENTS OF FIRST OF ALL IDENTIFYING RISK SICKLY MITIGATING THAT RISKY THOROUGHLY RESPONDING TO THE WILDFIRES RACE WHEN THEY DO OCCUR. NOW AS AN OUTCOME OF THE STRATEGY OF A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL ACTIONS CURRENTLY IN PLACE TO REDUCE UP THE RISK OF WILDFIRE. BODIES INCLUDES RESTRICTIONS ON WORK GOING ON DURING RED FLAG WARNINGS WE PUT THOSE IN PLACE WHENEVER THERE'S A RED FLAG WARNING. I'M BOB BLOCKING AUTOMATIC DEVICES IS AGO RE CLOSES IN OUR SYSTEM WE DO NOT RE ENERGIZE THOSE WHEN THERE'S A BAN ON THE SYSTEM DURING A HIGH -- AYE REQUIRES TIME -- ALSO WELL OUR VEGETATION MANAGER LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE LATER. ABOUT WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST MAN OUT F THE STATION MANAGER PROGRAM. AS WELL AS A PREEMPTIVE POWER SHUT OFF PROGRAM SAFETY POWER SHOP AMONG OTHER ACTIONS -- BUT I WILL SPEND JUST A MOMENT ON A COUPLE OF THOSE. TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE RESTRICTION OF WORK DURING RED FLAG WARNING PERIODS. I'M TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- THIS ASPECT OF OPERATIONS -- INCLUDES ANNUAL MID CYCLE PATROLS VEGETATION -- AND WE ALSO LEVERAGE AERIAL LINES FACTIONS IN HARD TO REACH LOCATIONS I'M IS PART OF THIS AND I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT PART OF OUR PROGRAM. WE ALSO PARTNER WITH FIRST RESPONDERS AND THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER CONDUCT JOINT PATROLS -- WITH LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES TO INSPECT FOR DICTATION NEAR POWER LINES WE CALL THIS OUR PROJECT SANTA ANA -- LASTLY AND I DID MENTION THE PROACTIVE I SHUT OFF HIS OPERATION PRACTICES CAN REDUCE FIRE RISK. AYE IN A PREEMPTIVE WAY AWARE UTILITY OR LIKE THE AS C. E. ESTUDIAR PRETTY NAY. UP JUST EMPOWER PREEMPTIVELY IN VERY LIMITED A HIGH FIRE RISK SITUATIONS AND ONLY DURING THE MOST EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. TIME NOW WITH C. TURNING -- TO SLIDER I ACTUAR ON SLIDE THREE NOW. SEC SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO INVEST SYSTEM HARDING OR ELECTRIC GRID STAR WERE ON SLIDE FOR NOW. S. C. SYSTEM SERVES FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES AND INCLUDES MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION POWER POLESWITH APPROXIMATELY ACCORDED THEM LOCATED HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. NOW BASED ON A WEATHER ANALYSIS CONDUCTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO AS HE LAUNCHED A COMPREHENSIVE POLL REPLACING PROGRAM TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH CONCENTRATED FIRST ON POLES LOCATED IN AREAS. THE POSE BOTH HIGH WIND AND HIGH FIRE RISKS AND ASSESSING THESE FALLS AGAINST THE UPDATED WIPED OUT WHEN STANDARDS. SOLUTION OUR EXTENSIVE EXISTING PRACTICES WHICH COULD A TWENTY FOUR HOUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER -- AND THIS IS DOWN SITUATION AWARENESS BOTTOM AN AROUND THE CLOCK INCIDENT COMMAND TO USING CONDITIONS MERIT AS HE'S CONTINUING HAS AGO METEOROLOGICAL MONITORING AND FORECASTING CAPABILITIES. SO NOW I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'VE HISTORICALLY DONE LIKE TO MOVE ON TO WAYS OR ENHANCING OUR RESILIENCE. SO AGAIN AS A LARGE PROVIDER OF INFRASTRUCTURE SERVING YOU GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE AND BROUGHT SERVICE TERRITORY WE KNOW THE HARDING OUR SYSTEM'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE CORE STRATEGIES. UP FOR RISING TO THE CHALLENGE OF YEAR ROUND WHILE FOR SEASON. THE BESIDES POLL REPLACING PROGRAMS I DISCUSSED. I IT SEES HARDING THE DESIGN OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN OTHER WAYS ON THESE A SIGNIFICANT AYE WE'RE INCREASING USE OF FIRE RESISTANT POLLS. A COMPOSITE CROSS ARMS COVER CONDUCTOR WHICH WILL BE A A SIGNIFICANT -- INVEST IN ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. AND CURRENT LIMITING FUSES AND SELECT AYE FAR RISK AREAS TO ENHANCE RESILIENCY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF IGNITIONS. THAT'S YOUR RAP UP POLICE OF OKAY TOM MIA GOT TODAY AND GOT A GREAT DECK I GOT THROUGH IT ALREADY SUBJECT SURE I I WOULD LIKE TO USE A COUPLE THINGS I THINK. HISTORICALLY SCE'S EMPHASIZE MITIGATION WILDFIRE RISK UP BUT THE YEAR ROUND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES IN THE NEW NORMAL ENVIRONMENT UNDERSCORE THE NEED TO DO MORE -- WAS TAKING PRACTICE STEPS TO BOLSTER WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANNING. AND BASED ON GOVERNOR BROWN'S RECENT PROPOSAL A GREAT HARDING ENHANCEMENTS. ABOUT WE BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AT THE STATE UTILITIES NEED TO REEVALUATE EXISTING POLICIES I THINK THAT'S BEEN A THEME IT'S REALLY WAS DURING A GERMAN PICKERS DISCUSSION EARLIER -- PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS AND DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH A TWO HOUR FIRE MITIGATION ENCOMPASSES OPERATIONAL PRACTICES WHETHER MONITORING AND SYSTEM HARDENING. BUT THIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT THE GRANT I THINK HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT ALREADY AS WELL. S. E. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REGULATORY AGENCIES FIRST RESPONDERS AND FIERY DISEASES WEALTHY COMMUNITIES OUR CUSTOMERS LIVE WORK AND OPERATE BUSINESSES TO ENSURE THAT OUR EFFORTS. ARE FULLY COORDINATED. IT FOR THAT CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PEOPLE THERE. THANKS VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR DODD -- YEAH I CHAIRMAN HOLDER MY NAME'S KEVIN DOW SO I'M NOW VICE PRESIDENT ELECTRIC ASSET MANAGEMENT OF P. JEANNIE AND I AM THE OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR COMMUNITY WELFARE SAFETY PROGRAM. WE'VE UP PASSED OUT OF THE PRESENTATION THAT WILL DEVELOP A FEW AND I JUST WANNA HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS IN THE CONTEXT OF KEEPING OUR MY REMARKS ON THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING ON THE GROUND -- TODAY THIS FIRE SEASON -- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TO KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITY SAFE BUT BEFORE I SAY THAT I I REALLY WANT A GUY WHO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. BEING IMPACTED BY THE WILDFIRES THAT ARE HAPPENING TODAY. I THINK -- LOSE THIS IS JUST AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW THINGS ARE CHANGING. IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND I THINK MAKES THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT MUCH MORE CRITICAL. I ALSO A P. JEANNIE AND I ALSO WANT TO MOURN THE LOSS OF AN EMPLOYEE THAT -- WHO'S WORKING ON THE CAR FIRE OVER THE WEEKEND -- IT SADDENS US TO TO YOU KNOW IN THE WORK OF IN THE I GUESS IN THE COURSE OF HIS JOB -- HE LOST HIS LIFE IT'S BEEN A RESTORING SERVICE HIGH HAS RESULT OF THE CAR FIRE. WE HAVE NINETEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THAT ARE WORKING IN RESPONSE. TO THAT DITTY FIRES THAT ARE BURNING HERE. AND ALSO AND PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE SINCE AND FAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. FOR THE MUTUAL AID THAT THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDING US FOR THAT SUPPORT AND ALSO THE IBEW -- WORKFORCE THAT WE HAVE THAT'S DOING ALL THE HARD WORK OF OF THAT RESTORATION. SO WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM THERE ARE. THREE COMPONENTS TO THAT THE FIRST IS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON BOLSTERING WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE -- IMPLEMENTING NEW AND ENHANCED SAFETY MEASURES AND DOING MORE OVER THE LONG TERM TO HARDEN OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF BOLSTERING EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS WE'VE ESTABLISH A DEDICATED WILD FIRE SAFETY OPERATIONS CENTER. ITS STAFF TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AT TIMES THAT -- CRITICAL EED -- IT'S STAFF BY A TEAM OF HGHLY INDIVIDUAL HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS KNOWLEDGE ONE ELECTRIC OPERATIONS. FIRE SAFETY METEOROLOGY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE THE CENTER PROVIDES REAL TIME CONDITIONS AND IS REALLY OUR EYES AND EARS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING -- OUT ON OUR SEVENTY THOU SERVICE TERRITORY. THAT TEAM ALSO LEVERAGES EXTENSIVE CONNECTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH CAL FIRE CAL WHO YES AND A NUMBER OF A LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE SUPPORTING US. FOR ALSO EXPANDING OUR NETWORK OF A P. JEANNIE OWNED WEATHER STATIONS WE'VE HAD SIXTY SIX NEW SUCH A WEATHER STATION SENSE. MARCH OR ADDING EIGHT TO TEN NEW STATIONS -- EVERY WEEK WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING A TWO HUNDRED INSTALLED A BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. THE ARMY UROLOGISTS USE THIS WEATHER DATA TO DEVELOP -- HAVE WEATHER FORECAST IN A HUNDRED AND NINE INDIVIDUAL FIRE INDEX AREAS SPREAD ACROSS HER SERVICE TERRITORY. AND THOSE WINTER THOSE WEATHER INDICES ARE DRIVING OUR OPERATIONAL BEHAVIORS -- ON THE GROUND. IN TERMS OF ENHANCE WHETHER IT EXCUSE ME IT IN TERMS OF ENHANCE SAFETY MEASURES ONE HIGHLIGHT FIRST THE WORK THEY WERE DOING IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- A PRESIDENT PICKER HAD TALKED ABOUT THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE ADOPTED WITH THE FOUR NEW CLARENCE STNDARDS. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH AND US WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM TO GO BEYOND. THAT THAT IS FOCUSING ON A REVIEW REMOVING TREES AND FUEL FROM AROUND ARE POWER LINES. TO CREATE ESSENTIALLY A FIRE DEFENSE ZONE -- THAT -- IS. REALLY PREVENTS THE THAT IGNITION OF FIRE BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY PRETTY HOOKER EAT A PLACE -- FOR DEFENSE TO BEGIN. THE THE AND THE SECONDARY WANTED TO MENTION IN TERMS OF THE ENHANCED OF NEW MEASURES IS THT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A PLAN. TO PROACTIVELY DE ENERGIZED POWER LINES IN THE MOST EXTREME CONDITIONS. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO P. JEANINE I I WANNA REALLY EVER EMPHASIZED THAT -- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF DE ENERGIZING POWER LINES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. OF THAT IN OF ITSELF CREATES AYE IT'S ONLY SET ITS OWN SET OF A OF SAFETY HAZARDS. AND SO WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO DESCRIBE -- THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT PROGRAM AND WORK WITH THEM AS FAR AS IMPLEMENTING THAT. THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT -- THAT WE HAVE -- DISABLED ARE WE CLOSING DEVICES ACROSS THE HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICT AREAS THIS COVERS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. AND HAVE BEEN DOING THAT ACTIVELY OVER THE LAST SUMMER -- PHIL HARRINGTON TALKED ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WORK THAT WERE THAT IS HAPPENING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. PARA WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE OTHER TWO UTILITIES AND ARE IMPLEMENTING A SIMILAR PROGRAM. THAT'S FOCUSED ON USING INSULATED -- STRONGER CONDUCTORS NON WOULD POLLS HARD NEW ENHANCED -- PROTECTIVE DEVICES. AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING RESILIENCE ZONES. HOW THAT WILL ALLOW US TO QUICKLY INSTALL ENERGY RESOURCES OBSERVE ARE AT COMMUNITIES DURING EMERGENCIES THAT WITHOUT ALL AND MY REMARKS? COULD YOU GIVE ME ONE MINUTE THOUGH AUTHOR ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT I SAW THE SLIDE. HERE TO THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABSOLUTELY WE HEAR THAT PLEASE. SO. AS I MENTIONED -- THE OF THE TO THE CPC ADOPTED NEW REGULATORY STANDARDS THAT -- REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CLEARANCES SENSUALLY RADIO CLASSES AWAY FROM OUR POWERLINES. THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO REMOVE TREESOUTSIDE OF THAT ZONE OF AND ALSO CLEAR VEGETATION -- UNDER OUR POWER LINES TO REDUCE THE THREAT THAT'S GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND MEETING COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. AND FOCUSING ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY ABOUT -- REMOVING BRUSH AROUND -- PROPERTY AGAIN IT IN IN COORDINATION WITH EFFORTS OF OTHER IN WITH OUR COMMUNITIES OUR CUSTOMERS. WE SEE THIS AS A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT -- TO OVERDOING WE'VE ARE INSPECTED FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF OUR LINE AND WE ARE ENGAGING -- ALMOST. SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY -- MR GEYER. POP CULTURE -- DIED AND CULTURE HEARD IN RUSSIA COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. UP THIS REALLY IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC GO FOR OUR STATE I I'VE BEEN A CG FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS -- I WAS OFFICER IN CHARGE ZERO SEVEN WILDFIRES. AND REALLY BEEN INVOLVED OR MITIGATION PLANS EVER EVER SINCE THAT TIME FOR OVER A DECADE. NERDIST AGENCY WE TAKE A VERY PRO PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH TO FIRE SAFETY. EYES DIMENSION WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OVER A DECADE -- THAT'S WHY WERE AHEAD AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE A LOT OF THINGS pWHO DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT EACH UTILITY HAVE A PROGRAM IN PLACE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE P. TO SEE A REGULAR SHOULD REVIEW THE PROGRAM -- AND THEN WE SHOULD BE DEEMED REASONABLE IF WE MEET THAT PROGRAM SO AS YOU THINK ABOUT PUTTING THIS IN THE LAW THOSE KIND OF THINGS GOING TO AFFECT. BUT AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE SPENT. OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST TN YEARS ON FIRE HARDENING A WE NEXT FIVE YEARS WILL SPEND ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS BOB. CAN WE STILL BE DUNCES ALONG PROGRAM THAT MAY LOT OF PROGRESS LIKE TALK ABOUT JUST THREE AREAS ARE FAR MITIGATION PLAN FIRST SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. PA THAT MINIMIZING CLINICIANS SOURCES AND SUPPRESSION AND OUTREACH SO FOR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS I KNOW SOME OF YOU. HAVE ACTION BEEN DOWN SCENES OF OUR WEATHER STATIONS THAT WE HAVE OVER HER WEATHER STATIONS OVER HUNDRED CAMERAS IT REALLY DOES. THIS BILL ALLOWS THIS A WEEK BEFORE AN EVENT TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHERE WE ARE FROM A FROM A FIRE AND WHETHER PERSPECTIVE. SO THE SAME INSTRUMENTS INTAKE YOU ALLOW ME A REAL TIME TO MAKE OPERATIONAL DECISIONS. WE DID NOT HAVE THOSE TOOLS AVAILABLE -- BICU TEN YEARS AGO SO. A BEEN OUR CAMERAS WE WORK VERY CLOSE WITH CAL FIRE. WHENEVER THERE'S IGNITION THIS HAPPENED BACK THE LILAC FIRE IN DECEMBER AND ALSO ON JULY SIX WE ACTUALLY SAW THOSE FIRES IN THERE AS BIG AS THIS TABLE. AND THEN WE WATCHED THAT WE WATCHES SUPPRESSION THE TOOLS ARE JUST INVALUABLE. FOUGHT SO REALLY WHAT IT DOES IT GIVES IS MICROCLIMATE FORECAST FOR EACH ONE OF OUR CIRCUITS IN BACK COUNTRY SO THIS INFORMATION IS TRULY CRITICAL. BUT IN THE MINIMIZATION OF OF FIRES A TALK WITH OF OUR GOODS MANAGER PROGRAMS -- WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND TREES LE IN OUR IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. PROBABLY THE BIGGEST A PART OF OUR SUCCESS IS WE HAVE EACH ONE OF THOSE TREES IN OUR GIS DATA BASE AND HAD A DATABASE. WE KNOW THE SPECIES A TREE WE KNOW HOW FAST IT'S GROWING WE KNOW IN LAST SUMMER'S TRIMMED THE LATCH SUMS INSPECTED THAT REALLY IS THE BASIS OF OUR PROGRAM [inaudible] WE ALSO THEN TAKE I HAVE A VERY VERY DETAILED PROCESS THAT WE GO OUT AND DO ALL THE PRE INSPECTION OF THOSE TREES ALL FOR SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AND ON AVERAGE WE END OF TRIMMING ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM BUT WE LOOK AT ALL THE THEN. WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT AUDITS WE OUGHT DEBT FREE INSPECTION PROCESS -- THEN WE GO BACK AND EXIT WE WE DROVE A HARD SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND REMOVED BY A THOUSAND TREES HERE. WE'RE PRETTY AGGRESSIVE AND WE MATED THE MORE AGGRESSIVEBUT WE TRY TO TEMPT TRIM BACK TEN TO FIFTEEN FEET. BAR SO THAT ALL THOSE TREES WILL MAKE IT TO RECYCLE. BOB THEM ONTO THE TREE TRIMMING WILL BACK INTO AN ART OF THE ACTUAL THE TREE TRIMMERS HIMSELF. AND AGAIN THAT'S ENSURE THEIR CONTRACTORS TO DO A GOOD JOB AND pSEASON GO BACK IN THE HIGHEST FIRE THREAT AREAS AND DO ANOTHER PATROL SO. YOU REALLY NEVER BE KNOWS -- TO HE HAVE TO REALLY WORK VERY HARD TO TREAT FOR ME WERE ALSO USING SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY NEW TECHNOLOGIES MENTIONED EARLY LIGHT ARE. THAT HELPS IT SHOULD DETERMINE HOW FAR TREES ARE WAVE MORE FACILITIES WERE ALSO USE NET FOR QC BY OVER INFRASTRUCTURE CSUS NOT SPEAK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. BOB WEAVER PLAYS STEP. ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOOT POLES OF STEEL POLES WHEN WE DO THAT WE PUT A BIGGER WIRE ALSO AND WE SPREAD THE CONDUCTORS ALL THIS IS REALLY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE NEW CONDITIONS NOW THAT WE KNOW ABOUT GOING TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. THROUGH OUR IMITATION WE'VE SEEN WIND SPEEDS OF A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR AND CITY A GO OUT TELL YOU NO ONE EVER KNEW THE WIND BLEW THE HARD DIEGO. SO WE REALLY HAVE SEEN A LOT THERE. ARE THREE MAIN PROGRAMS AND HARDENING ARE OUR FIRM PROGRAMS ARE DISTRIBUTION POLLS THAT WERE ACTUALLY KNOW THAT SMALL WIRE OUT THERE IS IS RECALL PUT A LOT OF TIMES THE WIND STORM SEWER FOLK WERE FOCUSINGON SMALL WIRE REPLACEMENT. IN AND HIGH FIRE AREAS WE HAVE A TRANSMISSION PROGRAM. WE'RE CHANGING OUT -- SHAWL STEEL POLES THAT'S WELL ON ITS WAY ACTION IT WILL BE DONE BY -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER PROGRAM OVERLOOKING A POLL LOADING NAME WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT -- HAVING COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS ARE POLLS NOW THAT'S THAT'S A BIG EFFORTS ARE USING LIDAR TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE ALSO TO SURVEY ALL THE POLLS ARE HIGHERS FAR GREATER AREA. RE CLOSERS -- THEY'VE BEEN OFF SINCE MAY OR JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ARE PART PROCESS IN THE PAST HAS BEEN. THE INTERMITTENT SPRING WHERE BILLY ELEVATE CONDITIONS THAT COME BACK ON AND IN DECEMBER JANUARY WE NEVER TURN THEM BACK ON THIS YEAR AND THEY WON'T BE ON AGAIN UNTIL WE GET SOME RAIN SAN DIEGO SO IT COULD COULD BE A LONG TIME. SO AGAIN A LOT A LOT OF WORK THERE AND JUST LASSEN OUT REGION SUPPRESSION WE HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO OUR CUSTOMERS ISSUES IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY THE POWER IS DE ENERGIZED. BOB WE WE ALSO WORKED VERY CLOSE TO THE AGENCIES WE SHARE ALL HER INFORMATION HELLFIRE OF SOME OF OUR BIGGEST SUPPORTERS ARE CAL FIRE THE CITY SAN DIEGO OTHER FOLKS THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH. I AS FAR SUPPRESSION. ARE WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE THE HELL ANKARD SAN DIEGO IT CAN DROP TWENTY SIX HUNDRED GALLONS OF WATER -- SMALLER HELICOPTER TO SEE MOST THE TIME COULD DROP THREE HUNDRED SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY THIS YEAR DISPATCHING THROUGH CAL FIRE. BUT WE'VE GOT MORE WATER THIS YEAR THAT WE HAVE ANY OTHER HERE IN THE PAST [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WAS DOWN IN ALPINE AND SAW WHAT A GREAT JOB THAT WAS TO GET THAT FIRE OUT AS QUICKLY AS IT DID GET OUT. MISTER JOSEPH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THINK IF THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. I REPRESENT THE COALITION CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES THAT INCLUDES IBEW. TWELVE FORTY FIVE WHICH IS MISTER DOESN'T MENTIONED LOST MEMBER TO THE CAR FIRE THIS PAST WEEKEND AS HE WAS WORKING TO RESTORE SERVICE. WE KNOW THE UTILITY LINES CAN BE THE SOURCE OF IGNITION AND EVEN ONE SPARK CAN HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. WE NEED A SAFER ELECTRIC GRID TO PREVENT THAT SPARK. WE NEED OUR ELECTRIC GRID HARDENED SO IT'S LESS LIKELY TO CAUSE A FIRE. TO GET THAT SAFE DRUG SAFER ELECTRIC GRID WITH A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY PROGRAM THE FOCUS ON SAFETY AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT NOW. PRESENT PICKER HAS TRIED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM SAFER MISS MALASHENKO HAS TRIED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM SAFER. AND THEY HAVE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH. WE NEED TO HARDEN UTILITY SYSTEM SO WE DON'T HAVE A REGULATORY SYSTEM RIGHT NOW TO GET THAT DOT. AND WE NEED A CLEAR PROCESS HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER CONFERENCE COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT ARE THE AFTER THAT TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE DEALING WITH. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO BEEF UP THE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. THERE FILE THE COMMISSION IS A GOOD START. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. DRAWS HEAVILY FROM S. B.. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS ON THAT FRONT. BUT WE RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT BETTER MITIGATION PLANTS ALONE ARE NOT ENOUGH. TO DO IT WOULD NEED TO DO TO PREVENT WILDFIRES. AND MANY CLEAR STANDARDS FOR WHEN THE UTILITY HAS BEEN PRUDENT AND WHEN IT HAS NOT TO THE COMMISSION KNOWS WHEN TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION YEAR AFTER YEAR. TO GET THE SAFER SYSTEM WE WANT AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE DESERVE. WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS AT THE P. YOU SEE IN THREE WAYS FIRST. WE CAN'T LEAVE SAFETY COSTS BURIED IN THE GENERAL RATE CASE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE THE WORK FORCE PLANTS IN ONE PLACE BUT WE HAVE THE COST TO IMPLEMENT THEM IN A DIFFERENT PLACE. WE NEED TO FOCUS PROCEEDING WHERE WE DECIDE WHERE THE COMMISSION DECIDES HOW AND HOW MUCH. TO HARDEN THE SYSTEM. THE CURRENT PROCESS WHERE THE COSTS FOR SAFETY COST FOR WELFARE MITIGATION OR IN THE GENERATE CASE IS NOT WORKING THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY OTHER THINGS. IN THE GENERAL RATE CASE. YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT ELECTRIC GENERATION CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATIONS SUPPLY MANAGEMENT LOGISTICS SUPPLIER DIVERSITY FLEET SERVICES I DON'T HAVE FIVE MINUTES I'M NOT GONNA GO ON WITH THE WHOLE LIST BUT YOU GET THE IDEA. THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF TOPICS IN A JOHN A RATE CASE SO WHICH SAFETY JUST ONE AND WILDFIRES JUST ONE SUBSET OF THAT ONE THING. SO WE NEED TO HAVE A GREAT CASE THAT FOCUSES ON SAFETY AND COMBINES THE SAFETY IN THE PLANS IN ONE PLACE. THIS LEADS TO MY SECOND POINT. THE SAFETY PLANTS HAVE TO BE TIED TO THE COSTS. WE NEED TO HARDEN THE SYSTEMS WE NEED TO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THE THREE TOYS HAVE JUST TESTIFIED ABOUT. BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD PERFECT SAFETY WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED MONEY. AND SO THE COMMISSION HAS TO BALANCE THE COSTS OF IMPROVING SAFETY WITH SOME THINGS WE WANT DONE. YOU KNOW IT MAY BE THAT THE THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO DO SOMETHING EIGHTY FIVE TIMES THE COMMISSION SAID YOU KNOW. WE CAN ONLY AFFORD TO DO IT SIXTY TIMES. BUT WE NEED THE COMMISSION TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. I NEED TO DO IT TOGETHER IN A RAPE CASE NOT SEPARATELY YOU KNOW IN A WILDFIRE PLAN PRECEDING THAT SAYS ONE THING AT A RATE CASE THAT SAYS SOMETHING ELSE. THIRD POINT THIRD THING WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO USE THE SAFETY PLANS TO SET THE STANDARDS. FOR THE UTILITY TO MEET AND A PROCESS FOR THE COMMISSION TO HOLD THE UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE. TO MEETING THOSE STANDARDS. WHAT'S THE COMMISSION HAS MADE THE HARD DECISIONS. THAT'S SAFETY PLAN SHOULD BE THE BENCHMARK ABOUT WHETHER UTILITY HAS BEEN RECENT ONE PRUDENT. IF UTILITY FOLLOWS ITS PLAN THAT'S UNBEATABLE PRUDENT IF IT HASN'T FOLLOWED ITS PLAN. BUDGET RESPONSIVE FOR THE DAMAGES AND SHOULD BE FINE. THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE THE ONE DECIDING. WITH THE UTILITY ACTION WAS REASONABLE PRUDENT. AND WE DON'T WANNA BE BACK HERE TO DO THIS AGAIN EVERY YEAR. SO LEGISLATOR THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD GIVE THE COMMISSION THAT GUIDANCE GIVE THE COMMISSION THE PROCESS. SO THAT IT CAN DO ITS JOB AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO WE WOULD TAKE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FIX THE UNDERLYING PROCESS SO WE CAN GET ON WITH HARDENING UTILITY SYSTEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND SETTING THE STANDARDS OF THE COMMISSION COULD APPLY TO HOLD THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK HERE AGAIN AND AGAIN [inaudible] THANK YOU. IF YOU MISSED JOSEPH. OKAY THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WOULD BE TAKE QUESTIONS NOW'S THE SENATE CANNELLA. IT'S JUST A QUICK QUESTION IS FOR IS THE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FUEL OTHER ANY REGULATORY. OBSTACLES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN YOUR WAY FROM FROM PERFORMING THOSE DUTIES AND IF SO WHAT ARE THEY AND HOW CAN THEY BE APPROVED. I THANK YOU CENTER FOR THE QUESTION I THINK ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IS THAT -- TO AS WAS ALLUDED TO A LITTLE EARLIER THAT THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SITUATION. IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. USING LIDAR SURVEYS WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION TREES THAT COULD. FALL INTO FOUR GROW INTO OUR POWERLINES. WAS SO ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES OR FOCUSING ON IS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO DO THE TYPES OF WORK TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND -- MEETING THE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND SO THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR US. IS AND UTILITIES GENERALLY IS THAT WE NEED TO GAIN PERMISSION FROM PROPERTY OWNERS TO DO THAT WORK AND SO. I GIVING TOOLS THAT ALLOW US. TO DO THAT IMPORTANT SAFETY WORK IT IS REALLY A CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT THAT -- IS NECESSARY SO ONLY PRIVATE PROPERTY ACCESS THAT'S THAT'S THE BIGGEST TOP SCORE THERE ANY AGENCIES WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE FOR OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE. A OP SCHOOLS FROM THE PERFORMING THAT WORK ABSOLUTE OF SUBSTITUTE AYE AYE HE'S YOU KNOW WHO THERE'S A PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS BUT ALSO AGENCY LAND MANAGER MANAGERS AND IT'S THE SAME ISSUE -- NOW IT'S EVEN MORE COMPLICATED WITH RESPECT TO THE THE GOVERNMENTAL LAND MANAGERS IN THAT THEY HAVE. MANY MANY REGULATIONS AND LAWS AND OTHER ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW ALL OF WHICH TAKE TIME. AND GET IN THE WAY OF DOING THIS FOR THIS CRITICAL SAFETY WORK. WE'VE MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS WITH A WITH SOME OF THE FEDERAL AGENCIES SERVE -- THE OF US FOR SERVICE BUREAU LAND MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS -- BUT IT STILL HASN'T YET TURNED INTO -- REALLY A CLEAR PATH FOR COMPLETING THAT WORK. OBVIOUSLY WE CAN DOING ABOUT FEDERAL OF GOVERNMENT BUT IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL ARE THERE AGENCIES THAT ARE AT HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED AREAS. THAT YOU WANT TO CLEAR OUT BECAUSE OF A FIRE HAZARD AND THE STATE AGENCY HAS. HELD YOU UP TO WHERE YOU COULD NOT PERFORM THOSE TASKS. OKAY SO AS PART OF THIS SO THAT THE SHORT ANSWER TO THAT IS YES WE DEAL WITH -- THE STATE OF STATE PARKS CALTRANS -- AND THOSE TYPES OF AGENCIES A PROBLEM MOST THAT WE DEAL WITH THE MOST OUT WE ALSO HAVE -- I GUESS THOSE ARE THE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE I THINK THE THE THE LARGEST MANAGERS OF LAND. HERE WHAT'S A TYPICAL TIME FRAME IT I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE TO GET PERMITS TO TO CLEAR THAT LAND. WHAT'S A TYPICAL TIMEFRAME FROM THE TIME TO THE TIME YOU GET A PERMIT TO BUILD A TO CLEAR THOSE TREES. SO WE'RE STILL IN PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO THE NEW PROGRAM THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT BUT WE YEAH IT'S THAT WERE EXPECTING AS RELATES TO THE STATE. LAND MANAGERS OF SIX MONTHS OR MORE IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORKERS TO YOU'VE IDENTIFIED TREES THAT COULD BE A FIRE HAZARD. AND IS TAKING OVER SIX MONTHS FOR THE STATE TO PROCESS THOSE PERMITS. ARE NOT AT THIS POINT NOT AGAIN I'M TALKING ABOUT ARE FOR THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO CHIU EXPECTED SO WE EXPECT TO THAT'S WE'VE SEEN AS IT RELATES TO OTHER. WITH YOUR WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PLAN IS THAT CONSISTENT DO YOU IDENTIFY AN AREA THAT'S LIKELY TO CAUSE A BIG FIRE AND AND WHAT DOES THAT WORK WITH YOUR PLAN TO HAVEOVER SIX MONTHS TO TO GET PREVENT. A NO THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S BY MEGHAN WERE WERE NEGOTIATING AND CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH OCEAN WITH WHOM. THE THE LAND MANAGERS WERE PROPERTY OWNERS TO COMPLETE THAT WORK IT WILL BUT LET'S PUT PROPERTY OWNERS IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF A LOT OF TALK ABOUT STEP THINK WE GOT A FRIEDMAN BILL THAT. WOULD GIVE YOU ACCESS TO PRIVATE PROBLEM ASSUMING YOUR SUPPORT OF THAT BILL YES ABSOLUTE COMES BACK YOU KNOW LOOK FOR TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER AREAS. AND WE'RE NOT TALKING I THINK FUEL MANAGEMENT REMOVAL OF THE FUTURE OF A FIRE THAT FUEL. AND WE ARE GETTING IN OUR OWN WAY AT THE STATE LEVEL I THINK THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH THINK THAT HE'S BE HIGHLY LA FEEL LIKE. YOU'RE NOT AGGRESSIVELY ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE I DON'T TRY TO BE KIND OF THESE AGENCIES BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO CRAFT A BILL THAT THAT DEALS WITH THIS ISSUE THAT HAS GOT TO BE PART OF THAT. THAT PLANNED SO. IF THAT'S A PROBLEM I BET THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ESTA HIGHLIGHT WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND HOW WE RESOLVE THAT ISSUE I THINK THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRICING THAT POINT -- THAT IS AN ISSUE IN THIS IS A ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE NEED HELP FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON TO ADDRESS OKAY WELL I WOULD LIKE TO AND UPON CONCLUDE BY QUESTIONS BUT TO BE NICE TO HAVE TO FOLLOW BACK UP ABOUT EXACTLY. HOW WE CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM SO WHEN FATHERS THAT BUT WHAT I WOULD I'D LIKE TO DO IS FOLLOW UP ON YOUR QUESTION AND THAT'S THE OTHER JET GENTLEMAN IF THAT'S IS IF YOU FIND THE SAME ISSUE? I IMPORTANT YOUR COMPANY YEAH I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE WOULD SAY FOR A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON ANSWERS YES -- I I THINK THE PRODUCT DAY PRIVATE OWNERS HAVE BEEN PROBABLY JUST ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF THE LARGER ISSUE VERSUS DEAL WITH -- BUT NONE WERE SUPPORT OF THAT LEGISLATION IS WHILE THE HELPLESS -- HELPLESS TO MORE AGGRESSIVELY OUR OUR OWN IN THE TOUR JUST PUTTING IN THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT A MILLION TREES IN INVENTORY. CONFUSION ANYWHERE SO WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRACK WHAT'S GOING ON THE QUESTION IS MOVING AGGRESSIVELY TO THOSE TRIMS AS WE SEE WE NEED TO DO THAT. OUT WE TRIM AROUND A SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR SO THE AT THE VOLUME IS LARGE -- THINK ABOUT THAT'S ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TREES A DAY AND I IN OUR TERRITORY SO THIS IS A ENORMOUS ISSUE AND MOVING THE PRODUCTION LINE -- EXPEDITIONS YOU THROUGH THAT ESPECIALLY AS WE HAVE A PERMIT HANG UPS IS IMPORTANT. THEY WERE BOTH THE SAME BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FOR PROCEED IN CITIES BUT YOU KNOW WE WERE ALWAYS OUT THERE TRYING TO GET THOSE [inaudible] IN TERMS AND THERE THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE AROUND -- PROJECTS IS WERE AS WERE HARD IN OUR SYSTEM THE SEQUEL PROCESS CAN BE A LONG PROCESS AT TIMES TO ADD SOMETHING ELSE THAT -- YOU KNOW THE QUICKER WE GET THAT DONE THE FASTER WE CAN IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO. JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION SO WAS IT A HUNTINGTON LAKE A COUPLE WEEKS HERE WHICH IS EDISON I THINK UC CONTROLS THAT AREA. AND THEY ARE TERRINGTON OF NE TAKING DOWN TREES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE JUST BEING LEFT IN PLACE. WHICH IS STILL FUEL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. IS IS THAT PART OF THE ISSUE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO TAKE THE TREES ONCE YOU TAKE THEM DOWN. I AM NOT AWARE THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR US IN THERE IS SOME -- AREAS UP THERE THAT ARE ACTUALLY FOR SERVICE SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THIS IS A VERY REAL YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT IS AN AREA WHERE AGGRESSIVELY -- USING LIGHTER TECHNOLOGY -- OUR OUR PLAN IS TO REMOVE THOSE BUT BUT DID AS FAR AS I KNOW THE AT THAT BEING AN IMPEDIMENT TO TRIMMING HAS NOT BEEN ONE OF THE WELL. I UNDERSTAND SO SO YOU FEEL LIKE. THERE COULDN'T BE ADDITIONAL. OF RESOURCES FOR YOU TAKE THOSE TREES ARE IN YOUR IF WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES OUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT FUEL IS WHO LEGAL BILL WOULD ALWAYS BE HOPEFUL HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO AYE SO I THINK ANYTHING THAT COULD. RELIEVE THE POTENTIAL BOTTLENECK WHETHER THERE'S ONE TODAY OR WILL BE ONE IS HELPFUL SO BIOMASS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH TREES THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN THE I'M REALLY COULDN'T SPEAK TO THE BY MASSIVE ISSUE AND IN PARTICULAR. THAT. THANK YOU. WILL BE DEALING WITH THAT NEXT WEEK DO YOU KNOW AS WELL A CRISIS [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. BECAUSE OF THE CAST THAT WE HAVE AT HAND. HEALTH EACH OF YOU PRESENTED ARE YOU PREPARED TO PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE YOUR PROPOSALS ON WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED. I I'LL START WITH THAT -- I THINK WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK AND WE'RE OPENING WERE OPEN TO ADDING TO THAT FRAMEWORK -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PLAN THAT WE SUBMITTED TO P. YOU SEE IN THE CAN DOWN OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IT IT'S NOT FOR THE EXACT SAME PURPOSE BUT BUT WE WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK THERE AND DAY AND WE WERE DEFINITE POSITION TO YOU KNOW START THAT DISCUSSION. AND I AYE BALANCE FOR US SO WE CALIFORNIA EDISON BUT WE ARE ALSO READY TO DO NOT HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND KEVIN MENTIONED AT SOME OF THE OTHER COLLABORATION THAT IS ESPECIALLY HAPPENED A VERY RECENTLY IS WE'VE -- AS AS FOR UTILITIES WE COULD COLLABORATE ON ON GOOD PRACTICES BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A POINT I HESITATE SAY BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE I THINK THE POINTS WERE MADE A COUPLE OF TIMES. ALL OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORIES ARE DIFFERENT SO WHAT MAY BE BEST AND ONE UP MAY NOT BE BEST MOTHER THAT THAT POINT WAS MADE IN THE EARLY DISCUSSIONS. BUT HAVING SAID THAT -- WE WE HAVE A PLAN AND A FRAMEWORK I WILL BE MAKING A FILING AT THE COMMISSION UP FOR SOME ADDITIONAL WORK WE EXPECT TO DO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE ELEMENT OF FORMS BASIS A FURTHER DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF WHAT STANDARDS SHOULD OR COULD BE. UP WERE READY FOR THE DISCUSSION. BUT I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT -- IS BECAUSE PHIL MENTIONED THAT WE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLEVERLY COST ACROSS THE AISLE USE HERE TO DEVELOP A A BASIC FRAMEWORK IN THE THAT THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT. ALL THREE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WOULD USE THAT SAME FRAMEWORK AND AGREE ON THE COMMON PRACTICES THAT MAKE MOST THE MOST SENSE. HAVE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE AND AND A SUPPLEMENT THAT WITH SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT ARE UNIQUE. TO EACH OF THE COMPANY SERVICE TERRITORIES HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THAT YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCES IN. OF THE VEGETATION AND TYPOLOGY AND SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS -- AND I THINK WITH WITH MILLION AND HALF OF SO WHAT IS THE BEST MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING WILD FARM OF RISK [inaudible] CENTER STONE. BUT IF YOU ARE MISTER CHAIR ENDOWMENT DON'T THINK APPEAR TESTIMONY -- I WANT TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT ON NOW CENTER CANNELLA IS -- COMMENTS HAVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION A DEAD OR DYING TREES. AND AND SPEAKING WITH SOME OF THE UTILITIES -- ENOUGH AND A PRIVATE DATA CONVERSATION -- THE ISSUE A SEQUEL COMES UP AND IMPEDING YOUR ABILITY TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE THE FUELS OUT THERE COULD YOU EACH DISTRICT REFLECT ON WHAT. YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN WITH SEAQUEST THAT WOULD BETTER ENABLE YOU TO DO. YOUR JOB OF CLEARING VEGETATION AND AROUND YOUR LINES. SO I'LL ALL STARTIN -- HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES A THAT -- THAT WE HAVE FACED WITH RESPECT TO THAT AND ALL I WILL GO TO THE QUESTION ABOUT WHO WOULD HAVE WOULD HAVE WE BEEN DOING WITH THE TREES THAT WE'VE BEEN REMOVING SO AND IMPEACHING SERVICE AREA WE'VE HAD POOR THAT WERE JUST DEVASTATED BY. TREE MORTALITY SO WE'VE BEEN REMOVING -- WELL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND THOSE TREES EVERY YEAR IT TOOK US ABOUT A YEAR TO STAND UP AND GET PERMITS INCLUDING SEQUEL TO HAVE A PLACE TO PUT BACK -- PUT THAT WOULD WE'VE WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH UP WE HAD TO FIRE ATHAT A FILE ON A LUMBER MANAGEMENT PLAN AND THE VARIOUS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS. AND SO I STREAMLINING IN A DELICATE IDENTIFYING A LEAD AGENCY THAT ADDRESSES THAT. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS THE LEAD AGENCY FOR MOST OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IS UTILITIES -- THAT HELPS HOGAN HAVING A SINGLE LEAD AGENCY WITH A CLEAR MISSION IN MIND. OUT WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL ENHANCEMENT RELATIVE TO THE WORK THAT WE DO. SO YOU'RE SAYING IT IT BASICALLY TAKES A YEAR TO GET OF THE PROCESS TO GET A TRUE BOOTING INTO TOOK PLACE WORK IN THE COMPOST ENTERED OR DESTROYED. BY I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT'S WHAT TOOK US TO CREATE THE STAGING AREA. THAT WE NOW USE ON A REGULAR BASIS SO WERE ABLE TO PICK UP THAT WOULD INTO AN OVERLY TALKING ABOUT PETER PLANTS ARE PROBABLY IN THE IN THE COMING WEEK BUT I KNOW THAT DAN SPEAKING WITH SOME OF THE KICKER PLANTE -- FOLKS WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY OF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF WE HAD UNLIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES ACCORDING TO THEM MAYBE TWELVE YEARS. TO GET RID OF A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE BILLION TREES THERE SOME PICKERS. THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON THE VERGE OF CLOSING THE FAST ENOUGH FOR THE DAY TO STAY IN BUSINESS SO THAT'S KIND OF AN URGENT SITUATION. COMING NEXT QUESTION IS -- FOR FC -- IS YOU KNOW -- OR NO NO I REPRESENT THE IDYLLWILD AREA WE JUST HAVE THE CRANSTON FIRE THAT WAS STARTED BY AN ARSONIST WHICH IS A VERY UNFORTUNATE SITUATION -- WHILE I WAS UP THERE TOURING -- THE SITE AND WITNESSING THE GREAT WORK OF HELLFIRE AND ALL THE THE BACKUP FIRE AGENCIES KEEPING THAT FIRE OUT OF THE CORPS OF IDYLLWILD IMPLYING CHO. I I NOTICE THAT THE TRANSMISSION LINES INTO AND I NOTICED SOME VERY DISTURBING PICTURES WHICH I LOVE TO SHARE WITH YOU PRIVATELY. THAT SHOWS ELECTRICAL LINES GOING THROUGH TREES. NOW THIS FIRE WAS AN ARSONIST FIRE THAT STARTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL. THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN HIGH TO ON HIGH GOAL FOR A FULL TIME. THIRD TWO WAYS AND INTO A TIME TO EVACUATE THAT HILL NOT KNOWING THAT THAT FIRE WAS GOING TO REACH A LOT OF THE RESIDENTIAL UNITS. BUT HAD A WHILE WIRES SPARK IN A WIN EVENT. IN IDYLLWILD AND IT HAPPENED IN THE COR. WE MAY NOT BE JUST TALKING ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED HOMES THAT WERE LOST IN OF COURSE WE EMPATHIZE WITH ALL THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SUSTAIN THAT DAMAGE BUT WE CAN REPLACE HOMES. AND WE CAN DISCUSS THE FINANCES OF THAT BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT COULD BE INCINERATED. AYE IF WE DON'T APPROPRIATELY GET OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT UNDER CONTROL IN AND AROUND OUR UTILITIES AND OF COURSE GETTING RID OF FIVE DEAD TREES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO. HOW DO WE ENHANCE THAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SO WE CAN GIVE A COMFORT LEVEL? OUT TO THESE PEOPLE AND IT UP AS A PART OF RISK ASSESSMENT AS A PART OF SCE TO LOOK AT AREAS THAT ARE COME FIND. THAT IF WE DO HAVE A WILDFIRE WE COULD SEE AN INK A MUCH HIGHER INCIDENCE OF MORTALITY AS OPPOSED. TO DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE TO PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS DIFFERENTLY SO BOB BOB DOLE START WITH OF A FIRST -- COUPLE IN AND BY THE WAY -- I'D BEEN FOLLOWING THE CRATCHIT FAR VERY CLOSELY OBVIOUSLY -- AND I KNOW OUR TEAMS THROUGHOUT THE AND THANKFULLY THAT WAS -- WAS EXTINGUISHED A RELATIVELY QUICKLY I KNOW THE ANSWER COOPER AS OUT THERE AS WELL SO WE HAD CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF THOSE LINES WHO LOST POWER. ON RELATIVE TO OF AND THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT STANDARDS AND HOW WE APPROACH THAT AND AND MAYBE TO A POINT IN PARTICULAR. I THINK THIS IS WHERE STANDARDS AS WE CAN ALL ALIGNED ON THEM ARE CRITICAL. I ON THE DEPENDING ON THE LINE OF FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS TRULY TRANSMISSION LINE VERSES THE DISTRIBUTION LINES -- WE HAVE AUTHORITY AND RIGHTS AND ABILITY TO DO ADDITIONAL TRIMMING FOR EXAMPLE TRANSMISSION LINE HOW WE HAVE RIGHTS OF WAY WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE MORE AGGRESSIVELY. AND A SOMETHING WERE MOVING FORWARD WITH ON DISTRIBUTION LINES WHICH I OBVIOUSLY CAN LOOK VERY SIMILAR TRANSMISSION LINES WE DON'T HAVE A SIMILAR RIGHTS OF WAY AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE ARE AGGRESSIVE AS A SINGER GAS LIKE FIGURES. AND MOVING VEGETATIONS THOSE LINES WE HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF AUTHORITY SO THREE THAT'S REALLY BE HEARD UP TO YOU BUT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE SHOULD BE REGULATING THAT WITH ANCILLARY STRUCTURES AND ACT AS SALES THAT COULD. CREATE PROBLEMS FOR YOUR TRANSMISSION LINES HIGH I THINK I COULD MAYBE TAKE A STEP BACK TO QUESTION ABOUT -- THAT IT IN THIS CONVERSATION WAS PRETTY MUCH THE LAST DISCUSSION WITH CHAIRMAN PICKER -- HAVING STANDARDS INCONSISTENT STANDARDS ACROSS THAT STATION MANAGEMENT AND OTHER THINGS IS A REALLY TO WILDFIRE -- THAT THE UTILITIES A OUR REALLY BE HAD COME PART OF THEIR WELFARE MANAGING PLAN IS A HELPFUL THING I I OBVIOUSLY MORE DIRECTION IN THAT AREA -- REPAIRS MORE REQUIREMENTS BUT I THINK IN MANY CASES -- THAT LEVEL DIRECTION TO BE HELPFUL. SO I GET AGAIN AND OBVIOUSLY WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR LINES INCLUDING THOSE AND IN THE IT OUT AWHILE THERE AND WE HAVE. A INGRESS AND EGRESS -- PART OF THE HIGH FIRE AREA DESIGNATIONS TWO AND THREE ACTUALLY DO INCORPORATE -- EGRESS INGRESS AND OF THE NUMBER POPULATIONS FUEL LOADING SUSAN LAYER OF THAT ITEM THOSE ELEMENTS GO INTO PRIORITIZATION NOT ONLY FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BUT ALSO INFRASTRUCTURE REPLACEMENT -- MY COLLEAGUE HERE LATEST EUGENE MENTION A SMALL WIRE PLACE FROM PROGRAM WE HAVE HAD THAT UNDER WAY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WERE ACCELERATING THAT IN HIGH FIRE AREAS. SAME WITH POLL REPLACEMENTS WE DO TARGET AREAS WHO WE THINK ARE MORE VULNERABLE THAN OTHERS SO IT'S A COMPLEX ANALYSIS BUT BUT THIS THE THE ELEMENTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I'D DEFINITELY FACTOR IN TO HOW WE ASSESS AN AREA AND HOW WE FOCUS OUR RESOURCES IN A PRIORITY BASIS -- TO TOGETHER TRIM VEGETATION ADDRESS INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES I'M AND AND REALLY RESPOND TO THE WELFARE SYSTEM JUST ONE FINAL BUT QUESTION -- WE HEARD FROM THE PC THAT THEY BASICALLY HAVE. THIRTY AUDITOR'S BETTER IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING ALL THESE LINES THOUSANDS OF MILES OF LINES. AND TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE -- A MORE DEFINITIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH HELLFIRE -- TO ENSURE THAT. FOR IT OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE HELPING YOU pWITH YOUR YOUR VEGETATION ISSUES OF WHICH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD ENCOURAGE A PC TO ENTERTAIN A MORE DEFINITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A HELLFIRE FIRE MARSHALS AND ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT BEING COUNTERS THAT ARE OUT THERE LOOKING AT THE LINES AND HAVE PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND FIRE DYNAMICS LOVE THEM MORE COMPREHENSIVELY I I I THINK THAT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL THERE'S ACTUALLY -- SOMEWHAT OF A MODEL LEASE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OF UTILITIES AND CAL FIRE IS THE OF PARTY LINE FEEL PREVENTION A FIELD GUIDE. IT REALLY ADDRESSES DEVICES BUT I THINK THAT'S A VEHICLE THAT THAT'S A DOCUMENT UPDATED EVERY TEN YEARS IT'S IN ITS RENEWAL CYCLE RIGHT NOW IS THAT MIGHT BE A PLACE. OF TRADITIONAL COLLABORATION WHETHER IT'S THERE OR NOT I THINK THAT LEVELS COLLABORATIONS EXTREMELY HELPFUL PROCUREMENT. BUT SENATOR -- JACKSON BLAST LAST ONE IT THANK YOU -- GET pSEQUEL WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THE KINDS OF THE KINDS OF BONUSES THAT HAVE BEEN PAID TO SOME OF THE LEADERSHIP IN. A PARTICULAR NO P. CHENEY HAS GIVEN SOME SIGNIFICANT BONUSES SAID THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE THAT MAYBE THAT MONEY WOULD BE BETTER SPENT. TRYING TO DO MANAGEMENT PLANS BUT KEEPING IN MIND THAT THAT RIGHT NOW SAFETY IS I THINK. HAPPILY FINALLY A ON EVERYONE'S WAVELENGTH -- I'M WONDERING OF THE P. CHENEY COULD CHIU -- A SHARE WITH US TOM HOW -- YEAR MAKING SAFETY THE OF YOUR A BUSINESS -- CLEARLY THIS IS. A CHANGE IN CULTURE COULD YOU SHARE WITH US. ARM HOW YOU GOING ABOUT DOING THAT. SURE ENOUGH IT TOUGH. ARAFAT -- YES ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S ITSTARTS WITH -- JUST HOW WE CONDUCT OUR DAILY BUSINESS -- WHEN WE -- WE START EVERY MEETING WE FOCUS ON THE SAFETY OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THAT MEETING AT AND ALTHOUGH -- OFFICE WORKERS PER SE ARE NECESSARILY EXPOSED TO THE TYPES OF HAZARDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE FIELD IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO OUR ORGANIZATION. THAT SAFETY IS IMPORTANT -- WE FOCUS ON THE HAVE. NOTS ARE DALY TAIL BOARD BRIEFINGS WITH OUR WITH OUR CREWS AND EMPHASIZING THE THE REALLY THE CRITICAL FOUNDATION OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING SO IT JUST IN TERMS OF HOW WE DISCUSS AND HOW WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY ON A REGULAR BASIS -- HIS OF HIS PART OF THAT WE HAVE ALIGNED R. INCENTIVE STRUCTURES COME TO HIGH DIDN'T INCORPORATE A SIGNIFICANT EMPHASIS. ON THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC THAT WE SERVE AS WE CONSIDER THAT -- WE HAVE DEVELOPED A A NUMBER OF HIGH WEEK BUT WE'RE CALLING OUR ONE PGD SAFETY PROGRAM. WHICH FOCUSES ON A EMPLOYEE SAFETY CONTRACTOR SAFETY AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AND IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING. CROSSED OUR AND ACROSS OUR ENTIRE ORGANIZATION EVERY LINE OF BUSINESS. DOING IT THE SAME WAY LEVER PRACTICE -- THE THE OTHER OTHER ASPECT THAT I WOULD MENTION IS THAT WE HAVE CREATED AN OFFICER LEVEL SAFETY AND THE SAFETY LEAD TO REPORTS TO OUR PRESIDENT WHO IS THE SINGLE CHIEF SAFETY OFFICER FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND AND IS -- INTERACTING WITH THE BOARD ON A REGULAR BASIS IN TERMS OF WHAT IT IS THAT MANAGEMENT IS DOING TO FOCUS. ON THAT AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE ARE ALSO HOW FOCUSING ON GRASSROOTS SAFETY SO REALLY. SAFETY THAT IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE PEOPLE ON THE FIELD AND OWNED BY THE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT I'M HARD REALLY HARD. DETERMINING HOW THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF THAT. OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR DAY AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE OPERATION OF OUR COMPANY AND AND HOW ABOUT WILDLIFE'S SAFETY. WILDLIFE SAFETY OF THE BOOK A COUPLE THINGS I WOULD MENTION THEIR ONE OF THE HIGH. THAT ONE OF THE KEY AREAS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IS -- BIRD SAFETY -- MIGRATORY BIRD ACT COMPLIANCE WE HAVE ADOPTED A HAD A BIRD SAFETY DESIGN SO HOW WE DON'T LET'S% LOOK LET'S NARROW THIS DOWN BECAUSE I'M I'M I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT. I'M SORRY I SAID WILDLIFE DENY I MET WHILE FIRE SAFETY OKAY PUFF PUFF PUFF. OBSERVERS TRADE OF GIVE ME. CANCER HAS TRANSIT QUESTION THREW ME A LITTLE BIT REYES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MIGRATORY FOR EXPERTS WHAT IT WAS MY FAULT SO LET'S GET TO THE ISSUE AT HAND WILDFIRES. HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHILE FIRE SAFETY SO I I I IT'S VERY BRIEF REMARKS AND I COVERED THE HIGHLIGHTS THEIR IN -- THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THE THE PROGRAM THAT I TALKED ABOUT IS A IS A PROGRAM THAT IS BUILDING ON TOP OF SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE -- OVER NUMBER YEARS JUST UP TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT PEONIES INVESTED OVER FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN ITS TRANSMISSION ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. A LOT OF THAT WORK GOES DIRECTLY TO THE TYPES OF MEASURES THAT REDUCE WILDFIRE RISKS. PACIFIC WE REPLACING SMALL CONDUCTORS WITH LARGE CONDUCTORS. ARE REPLACING WOULD POLLS CONDUCTING MAINTENANCE ADDING ADDITIONAL -- AUTOMATION INSULIN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE NOW EXPANDING BEYOND THAT. TO BE A TENSE ALL INSULATED CONDUCTORS --% AND NON WOULD POLLS IN THE HIGHEST FIRE THREAT DISTRICT AREAS. YOU THE THING ON A MENTION OF TALK A LOT ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BUT JUST TO PUT IN CONTEXT. PGD INVESTS I'M ALMOST HALF EVERY YEAR IN A ROW CLEARING REMOVING AND HANDLING. OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AROUND OUR HOUSE ARE POWER LINES THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN ONE THAT HAS DOUBLED -- OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS SO THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS IS THIS ENOUGH I REALIZED LOT MONEY YOU HAVE THE BIG TERRITORY YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THE TO COVER. IS THIS IS THIS PROGRAM IS IT SOMETHING THE P. YOU SEE HAS CREPT DIRECTED YOU TO DO OR SHE IS THIS YOUR INDIVIDUAL COMPANY ANALYSIS OF WHAT IS APPROPRIATE VERSES. WHAT ARE PERHAPS THE BEST PRACTICES? GIVEN YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND YOU KNOW THE AREA YOUR WORK AREA AND LIKE STP -- SAN DIEGO CLEARLY DIFFERENT OF VEGETATION AND SO FORTH HOW TO HOW WE VIEW DECIDED -- WHETHER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OR HAVE YOU DECIDED IF YOU HAVE THAT THIS IS SUFFICIENT. SO I THINK SOME OF THE THEMES OF THE OF THE HEARING TODAY HAVE INDICATED THAT WE ALL HAVE TO BE VIGILANT TO CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND RESPOND TO THAT SO. I I CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S ENOUGH I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ENVIRONMENT -- IN THAT WE ARE OPERATING A SUBSTANTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THAT IN THE LAST QUESTION IS WHO SHOULD BE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. SO A PGD SUPPORTS THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO A PROP UP A PROGRAM IN A PROCESS THAT -- CONSIDERS THE UTILITIES WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT PLANS -- AND INCORPORATES THAT AND IT INTO THE TRANSPARENT OPEN PROCESS AT THE CPC USES. AT WE WE WITHOUT MECHANISM IS THE RIGHT MECHANISM FOR THIS FOR THIS APPROACH NUMBER HALF THE MIGRATORY BIRDS I THINK HA HA HA HA HA. SO I I'M GONNA FALL OF ONE WHICH HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON THE JOB. GOT THIS SPECIFIC JOB YOU'RE ON RIGHT NOW MISTER DEATH SO I'VE BEEN IN THIS ROLE FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS HAVE BEEN WITH A PGD FOR THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS SO I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING YOU SAID TODAY. AND YET PGD WAS FOUND ELEVEN OF SIXTEEN FIRES IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A WILDFIRE SEASON. SO HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU TAKE FROM WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ALL OF US HERE AT THE DIS TODAY? AND THE FACT THAT ELEVEN OUT OF SIXTEEN OF THOSE WILDFIRES YOU WERE NEGLIGENT IN FOLLOWING STATE LAW. ON CLEARING IN -- I CLEARING FROM -- YOU KNOW THE POWER LINES. THE OTHER BECAUSE HE FIRES. SO THE THE ONGOING SAYS THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE RESULTS THE CALIFORNIA INSTIGATION. AND ARE ANXIOUS TO LOOK TO SEE HOW IS IT THAT HOW IS IT THAT THEY CAN MAKE THOSE CONCLUSIONS WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DID THAT. AND I AT THE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PROGRAMS HAVE MET THE STATE'S HIGH STANDARDS FOR HARM. FOR COMPLIANCE WELL. FILM AT ELEVEN OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR TESTIMONY. LET'S CALL UP THE OUR LAST GROUP BUT I'M A MEMBER. THANK YOU WILL NOW CONVENE OUR OUR FINAL PANEL. OF THIS WILL DEAL WITH PEER YOU PLANNING. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND AS THERE COMING FORWARD. TOM IF WE I A I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE. HAS AN IDEA WHETHER NOT THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC COMMENT BUT IT'S ZERO SHOW OF HAND SICILY'S AT THIS POINT OF WHO. WOULD BE LOOKING TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] SELECT. OKAY THREE PEOPLE I DOUBT. OKAY THANK YOU. THAT'S HELPFUL. SO WE'RE GONNA WELCOME -- VERY MALIGN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. TERRY CROWLEY UTILITY DIRECTOR CITY OF HILLS PER. AND MARTIN L. ADAMS TO THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WELCOME ALL OF YOU. OKAY -- VERY YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST. THANK YOU CHAIR HOLDING -- GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M VERY MOLINE. EXACTION DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL YOU SO SOLUTION WOULD REPRESENT OVER FORTY PUBLICLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. AFTER MY BRIEF MARSHALL HERE FROM THE LARGEST PO YOU AND ONE OF THE SMALLEST ABOUT THEIR WILDFIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS -- AT THE OUTSET ONCE THEIR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE VICTIMS OF THOSE IMPACTED BY THE MEANWHILE FIRES WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS -- WE SHARE THE OPINION THAT THESE DISASTERS ARE AN INDICATION OF THE NEW NORMAL THAT REQUIRES US TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT. EFFECTIVE RESPONSE. PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES ARE LOCALLY OWNED AND NOT FOR PROFIT. OUR GOVERNING BOARDS ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEY REGULARLY HERE FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS A GOVERNING BOARD MEETINGS. ONE TO TWO TIMES PER MONTH. AS WELL AS IN BETWEEN MEETINGS AT PLACES LIKE THE GROCERY STORE LOCAL RESTAURANTS -- MANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS. AND YOU KNOW THE STRONG COUNT ABILITY THEY HAVE TO THEIR RESIDENCE. I'VE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS AND BEFORE THAT I SERVE THAT IS BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR OF THE FLORIDA MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC ASSOCIATION MY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISASTER RESPONSE WHICH IS PRIMARILY INVOLVING HURRICANES. OF THE TWENTY YEARS AGO FLORIDA DID A POOR JOB TOP TO BOTTOM IN ITS DISASTER RESPONSE. AND AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF BACK TO BACK MAJOR HURRICANES WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. WHEN OUR BIGGEST LESSONS WAS? A SURPRISE. WE LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF FOSTERING A CULTURE. WHERE UTILITIES AND AGENCIES DISCUSS WHAT WORKS AND ALSO? WHAT DOESN'T WORK? FLORIDA TURNED THE CORNER ON EFFECTIVE PREPAREDNESS AND RESTORATION WHEN EVERYONE AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE. TO THESE ACTIONS WERE ALSO ANALOGOUS TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO SOME DEGREE. WERE LOOKING STRENGTHENING UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE BOLSTERING MUTUAL AID AND STAGING CREWS. EDUCATING COMMUNITIES IN PREPARING RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE. HURRICANE SEASON THERE IN FLORIDA BUT THE ENTIRE WELFARE SEASON HERE -- IMPLORING UPON RESIDENTS TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY BURIALS ORDER I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR ALL OF OUR PRISONERS. WE'RE GOING TO STICK TO THE SAME FIVE MINUTE PRESENTATION. THANKS THANK YOU. ALLY AND AS WELL AS IMPROVING -- EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SIMILAR TO US SENATOR DODD AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOODS BILL SENATE BILL EIGHT THIRTY THREE WHICH CMU A SUPPORTS. SO WE'RE AT AN INFLECTION POINT NOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. PEOPLE USE ARE COMMITTED TO BEING PART OF A BROAD SOLUTION TO THE STATEWIDE ISSUE -- WE IMPLEMENT PROACTIVE WILDFIRE PREVENTION RESPONSE TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS. AND PREVENT WILDFIRES FROM DEVELOPING AN SENATE HUESO YOU BROUGHT UP THIS IDEA OF A MULTI PARTNERSHIP EDGY -- WITH CPU SEEK. DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY UTILITIES ALL WORK TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHAT FLORIDA DID IN ITS HURRICANE PREPARATION AND IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS WHERE WE ARE -- AND IMPROVE GOING FORWARD -- AND AND SENATOR JACKSON YOU BROUGHT UP OF TENDER JACKSON STEPPED OUT BUT SHE BROUGHT UP. LAWYER WHO WILL LEAD THAT AND I CAN SAY THAT IN FLORIDA WAS THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THE OFFICE EMERGENCY OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BEGIN THOSE EFFORTS -- WE COMPLY WITH RULES OF A VARIETY OF FROM FROM A VARIETY OF STATE AGENCIES AND WE ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN FOR YEARS. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BROAD ARRAY OF CPUC SAFETY REGULATIONS ALL PO USE FOLLOW THE CPU SEIZE POWER LINE CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE REGULATIONS. AND THIS INCLUDES THE RECENTLY ADOPTED STATEWIDE FIRE THREAT MAP AND THE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY HAZARD. CORRECTION REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED WORK WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND FIRST RESPONDERS HAS MANY PEOPLE USE OUR CITY DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE INTEGRATED WITH OUR OVER ALL OF THEM STRUCTURE. IT'S A NATURAL COMMUNICATION PATH THAT FACILITATES EFFECTIVE COORDINATION. SO IN CLOSING. OUR WANT YOU KNOW THAT UP HERE USE COME IN ALL SIZES. ARE URBAN RURAL FORESTED IN DESERT LARGE AND SMALL AND WE BELIEVE IN A FLEXIBLE STRATEGY. THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THIS VARIABILITY. A WHERE YOU TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRE ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS THANK YOU. Q.. AND NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM A MARIN ADAMS AND MY APOLOGIES HERE WITH THAT THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT WATER POWER. THAT YOU VERY MUCH MEDINA FOES PROMOTION OR WHATEVER. IT'S A PLEASURE TO SPEAK EVERYONE TODAY OF THERE'S BEEN SOME GOOD QUESTIONS I TRIED RIGHT DOWN. THINGS I HAD TO OFFER ALONG SOME OF THOSE LINES TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE. TO BRIEFLY KIND OF HIGHLIGHT WHAT LOS ANGELES DOES IN THE AREA WILDFIRE UP PREPAREDNESS. THIS IS NOT A NEW AREA FOR THIS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OR BOARD DIRECTED US TO DEVELOP. THE A WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLAN AND SO IN TWO THOUSAND IN THE ADOPTED THE FIRST PLAN -- AT THE TIME THAT PLAN IS CONTINUE -- TO EVOLVE OVER THE YEARS AT CLEARANCE AND BRUSH PROTECTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN SUCH AND SO WE DO HAVE -- AND HAVE REALLY VALUE TO THE RISKS THAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF WILDFIRE EXPOSURE TO THE CITY INTO ITS RESIDENTS AND TO THE AREAS THAT ARE THAT ARE WIRES GO THROUGH. AND WE DO TRY TO MITIGATE THOSE IN THE SENATE ACTIVE IN OUR UTILITY FOR THE LAST DECADE PLUS. AND A METAPHOR IN OUR NEXT BOARD MEETING IN TWO WEEKS OR BOARD WILL HEAR THE LATEST UPDATE AND ADOPT THE LATEST STANDARDS TO WILD FIRE PROTECTION PLAN. I'M SERIOUS INNER JACKSON HAD TO GO ON SHOULD S. COUPLE TIMES A QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE WHO SHOULD ENFORCE. THE RULES THAT I WILL SAY THAT IN A PUBLIC UTILITY -- WE DO HAVE SOME WE NEED A RESPONSE ON THAT'S OUR BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND THE RESPONSE OF THE CITY COUNCIL A GROUP OF ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO RESPONSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC WHO ARE WHO ARE ARE OWNERS AND SO. WE HAVE A VERY DIRECT LINES RESPONSIBILITIES VERY CLEAR WHO WE ANSWERED TO SO ON I WOULD SAY THAT -- IT'S DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT SITUATION BUT IN A PUBLIC UTILITY SITUATION WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME ROLL UP AND CHECK IN WITH THE STATE BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED ARE CONSISTENT WITH STATE STANDARDS. AND THINGS OF THE SEA HERB PC WOULD DO BOBBING BUT WE DO HAVE CREOLIZED RESPONSE REALLY WHO WE HAVE TO ANSWER TO AND WHO ARE JOBS ARE BEHOLDEN TO IN AND WE RESPECT THAT LINE OF AUTHORITY YES. AS A BEING THE BOSSES OF THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER. NOW THE SECOND PAGE IS A HANNAH I HOPE YOU WILL RECEIVE THEIR I FIRE AND AND WINDY AREAS OWNS A THIS IS JUST THAT BUT THERE'S A MAP OF LOS ANGELES. COME BE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE LARGE SIX WANT TO SIT IN THE COUNTRY OF FOUR MILLION PEOPLE SERVED LOS ANGELES. HIM HAVE BUT ONE AND A HALF MILLION SERVICE CONNECTIONS -- WITHIN THE CITY AND STRETCHING OF OUR TRANSMISSION WHICH REACHES FIVE STATES WEAVER GATHER POWER FOR LOS ANGELES FROM FIVE STATES WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND MILES OF CONDUCTORS. ON THE IN THE CITY ITSELF THE FIRE ZONES ARE PRINCIPALLY AROUND THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AND THE RIM OF THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AS YOU SEE. NOW THE ONLY PLEASE A CALPERS REALLY IDENTIFIED IS SET UP ROOM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND IN YELLOW SHOWN AREAS AND WE BY THIS HIGH WIND AREAS THAT WE'RE CAN. CERTAINLY WE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE DENSITY OF LOS ANGELES WELFARE RISK IS STILL VERY REAL THERE ARE ELEVEN NUMBER OF RURAL AREAS EVEN WITHIN. ITSELF WITHIN ITS FOREIGN SEVENTY FIVE SQUARE MILES. WE HAVE MAJOR FIRE SUCH AS THE BEL AIR FIRE THE WORST FIRED HIS TO THE CITY OVER FOUR HUNDRED HOMES LOS. WE HAD THE YES STATION FIRE -- THAT THE HIT SERIES THE NORTH SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THE CREEK FIRE LAST YEAR AND THE HUNGER TO HUNT AREA. THAN THE SKIRBALL FIRE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF LOS ANGELES HOW RIGHT ABOVE BILL AIR AND THAT THE IN NEENAH WI PUTTING. YOU KNOW SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS OF PEOPLE AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE DENSITY OF THE CITY SO. ALTHOUGH WE DON'T SEE THE THE SPREAD OF THAT SOME OF THE I OR YOU SEE IN TERMS OF THEIR FACILITIES RECEIVED A LOT OF RISK WITHIN LOS ANGELES. THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WERE IN LA WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING CLOSE TO LIVE IT RELATED TO THE LA FIRE. TO WHO HAS A FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTE NATURAL. TIME TO MOST INCIDENT SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN A RURAL SETTING BUT NONE THE LESS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF OF RISK THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF NEXT LIKE TALKS ABOUT SUMMER CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS WE'VE ADOPTED A NUMBER OF STANDARDS FOR CONSTRUCTION HIGHER FIRES OWNS. AND HIGH WINDS OWNS NOT ONE OF THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS GO TO A LARGER HIGH -- HAVE YOUR CONDUCTORS IN THOSE AREAS BROTHERS WAH COPPER OR WHETHER IT'S ALUMINUM CONDUCTOR STEEL -- WE HAVE HIGHER READINGS FOR WILL BE USED IN THOSE ZONES. WE ALSO CHANGE OUR SPEAK SING FROM WHAT'S NORMALLY -- CALLED FOR IN STATE STANDARDS TO LAUNDER SPACING BETWEEN WIRES AND THAT MEANS THAT WHEN THE WIND BLOWS. THAT IS IF THE WHAT CONDUCTORS MOVE IS LESS CHANCE OF THEY'LL SLAP TOGETHER AND CREATE A FIRE RISK IN SO THAT ALONE HAS A LOT TO THE SEAT. THAT WE HAVE PRUDENT THINGS TO COVER SOME OF THEBEAR CONDUCTORS IN CERTAIN AREAS. AND WE ALSO A GREATER WIND LOADING A CALIFORNIA NGUYEN LOTUS LITTLE OVER FIFTY TO HAVE MILES OUR FOR FOR A DESIGN PURPOSES. AND WE'RE USING EIGHTY MILES AN HOURS ARE DESIGNED PURPOSE WHEN BOATS WERE LOOKING AT HIGH CANYON WINS. BUT BASS OF WE'VE WE'VE STRENGTHENED OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THESE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE MOST PRONE TO HAVE TO FIRE THREAT. THE NEXT SLIDE TALKS WITHOUT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF FUEL SOURCE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE THE STATEWIDE. WE BEGAN WITH OUR OF FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAM THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN IN THIS -- MEETS OR EXCEEDS ALL THE STANDARDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE ISN'T EXPANDERS. THERE'S CPUC STANDARD YOUR ORDER NINETY FIVE IS A CAL FIRE STANDARD SO WE EXCEED ALL THOSE EXISTING STANDARDS AND IF THE STATE DOES ELECTED CHANGER STRENGTHENING STANDARDS WILL CONTINUE TO MEET OR EXCEED THOSE STANDARDS AS WELL. WE HAVE A MAIN WE MAINTAIN A DATABASE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TREES THAT SIXTEEN FROM POLAND'S VALLEY ACTUALLY MODEL BASIN THE BOTHER OF MOST MODEL BASIN. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SAN PEDRO. WE HAVE A YEAR ROUND TRAINING CYCLE BETWEEN OUR OWN CREWS AND CONTRACT CREWS WHERE WE FOLLOW THIS MEASURE PRACTICES FROM THE SOCIETY OF MUNICIPAL ARBORISTS TO MAKE SURE WE TRIM TREES PROPERLY ALONG THE ENTIRE RIGHT OF WAYS FOR A FOR OUR POWERLINES. WE ACTUALLY TRIM ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TREES ANNUALLY IN SPENT ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR JUST ON TREAT. AND ALL THE TREE TRIMMING AND THERE'S A QUESTION BEFORE ABOUT WHO INSPECTS A TREE TRIMMING WE HAVE CERTIFIED -- LINE CLEARANCE ARBORISTS ON STAFF THAT INSPECT ALL THE WORK BOTH BY OUR CREWS AND BY PRIVATE TO MAKE IT A HOT* CREWS. ONE ISSUE WE DO SEE IS TREES AND PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR RIGHT AWAY. THAT MAYBE HAVE GROWN LARGEST CROWNS -- STATE SHE'D GIVEN THE WAY YEAR WE HAD A COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT HAVE BAD WE CAN ROOT OLD ROOTS. AND SO THE POTENTIAL THOSE TO FALL INTO OUR RIGHT AWAY IS AN ISSUE AND LOOKING AT HOW WE GET ON THE PRIVATE PROPERTY IS A CHALLENGE FOR US IN SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TACKLE THIS TIME. LAST YEAR WHEN THE FOCUS LIMIT ON OF WE'RE DOING FOR RESILIENCY PLANNING. A WE ARE IMPLEMENTING -- MORE SMART GRID TECHNOLOGY AND DESTRUCTION AUTOMATION WE HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VISIBILITY OF OUR SYSTEM NOW BUT NO WE'RE WE'RE WE'D LIKE TO BE WE KNOW THAT IN FIVE TO TEN YEARS WILL HAVE MUCH GREATER CONTROL OVER SYSTEM. WE DO HAVE AUTOMATICALLY CLOSERS ON A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ARTISTRY XIN LINES BOMB BUT THOSE ARE CLOSE OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND WE ALSO ARE RUDE EVALUATING HOW OFTEN THOSE SHOULD BE USED BUT TYPICALLY ARE CLOSURES ACT ABOUT TWENTY ONE TIMES A WEEK. NONE OF THESE OF EVER CAUSE A FIRE BUT IF WE DID NOT HAVE A MAC TO AUTOMATICALLY THE V. TWENTY ONE MORE POWER OUTAGES WE CAN THE WAY OUR SYSTEM IS SET UP. A LOT OF TIMES EASIER CLOSURES HAPPEN ON THE VALLEY FLOOR SOME THE CIRCUITS REGION OF THE HILLS FULLY HAPPEN IN AREAS THAT ARE VERY DENSELY POPULATED AND SERVE A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT THEY DO NOT REALLY HOUSE IN HIGH FIRE AREAS AND SO TRYING TO SEPARATE OUT THE HIGH FAIR AREAS FROM OTHER RESTLESS DID ISSUES S. MISS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND WOOD THAT WOULD AIM TOWARD IN THE FUTURE. AND WE HAVE NO AUTOMATIC CLOSES ON TRANSMISSION LINES SO THE LINES AT TRAVEL THROUGH THE WILDERNESS DO THEY GO OFF THEY GO OFTEN SO WE ALWAYS PATROL THOSE ADDRESS THE OURSELVES. AND I'M GLAD I MEAN I'M SORRY IF I COULD JUST INTERRUPT GETS A SENATOR DODD HAD A QUESTION THEN AFTER HE'S OUT HIS QUESTION IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE. MAYBE THIRTY SECONDS READINESS THAT'S FINE OKAY A SUBSITE YES ARE YOU GOING TO POINT OUT THAT AND THEN OF LASSIE -- WE ARE WE ARE WORKING AT TO LAST POINT -- WE DO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT NEW MATERIALS OF STEELPOLES ARE MENTIONED NEVER TIMES TODAY ABOUT THE USE OF STEEL POLES. ONE OF THE ISSUE THE STEEL POLES AT THE OF STEEL POLES YOU HAVE TO TURN THE POWER OFF TO WORK ON THEM. THE AND CERTAIN AGENCIES HAVE NO PROBLEM TURN THE POWER OFF ON THE CUSTOMERS TO DO THE WORK WE HAVE A POLICY TWENTY CUSTOMERS IN POWER WE WORK HIGH. ON A LOT OF OUR LINES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN SO WE DO YOU STILL POLLS WHERE WE THINK THERE'S A PARTICULAR RISK WE DON'T USE IN UNIVERSALLY BECAUSE A CUDDLE BECAUSE GREATER POWER OUTAGES MORE FREQUENTLY AS WE TRY TO DO OUR WORK. WELL SO USING THINGS AS PALMER INSULATORS AS OPPOSED TO PORCELAIN. AND ALSO FAR LESS ARMS THINGS ARE MORE RESILIENT IN THE NEW PRODUCTS WERE TESTING ONLY PRODUCTS COME ON THE MARKET LOOK FOR THE PROPER APPLICATION. BUT WERE ALWAYS CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE WE LOOKED AT THE BLOW THE PLUS AND THE MINUS SIDES OF ANY OF THOSE. ON THE LAST COUNT I WANT TO MAKE IT A MAYES BECAUSE THERE'S TO TALK ABOUT ABOUT RATES AND AND EFFECTS OF ALL THIS BECAUSE I'M OF FIRE PREVENTION. FARK FIRE PROVISION OF FIRE SAFETY AS WELL WORKER SAFETY PUBLIC SAFETY IS ALL BAKED INTO THE RAKES AND A BIG THAT OUR EXPECTATION FOR WOULD WHAT WE DO IS PART OF OUR JOBS. I WE HAVE A VERY SOLID CREDIT RATING AGAIN WHAT WE'VE HAD HAPPEN IN FIRES IS NOT AFFECTED THAT IT HAS AFFECTED OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE. WE'VE HAD LESS COVERAGE FOR MORE MONEY AND WE SEE CHALLENGES IN GETTING EVERYTHING THAT CAME UP EARLIER ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF THE IN GOOD INSURANCE COVERAGE BUT THE CERTAINLY A DISSIDENT PART OF HOW WE OPERATE THE LAST TEN YEARS SO IS IT IS PART OF OUR PLAN FOR HOW WE OPERATOR SYSTEM HOW WE BUILD OUR SYSTEM AND HOW WE CHANGE OUR SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE TO KEEP UP WITH CURRENT WITH WHATEVER RISKS WERE FACING. SOURCE OF YEAH BUT OKAY SO -- YEAH YOU HEAR ABOUT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT IGNITING FIRES YOU KNOW WE'VE WE SOUGHT THE OUT. LAST YEAR -- DON'T HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT MUNICIPAL -- UTILITIES OR DO YOU KNOW. SO I I GUESS MY HERB PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. AT HOW MANY -- IGNITIONS HAVE YOU HAD FROM YOUR POWER SYSTEM WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT THE ONLY ONE THAT I'M AWARE OF IS THE POWERHOUSE FIRE DO SOME DEBATE ABOUT. EXACTLY THE CAUSE BUT THERE'S SOME BELIEVE THAT ONE OF OUR WIRES WENT DOWN ON ONE OF OUR POWER PLANT. AND AND THEN THAT WAS RE POWERED BUT NOT BY AND AUTOMATICALLY CLOSER AND THAT THAT MAY HAVE IGNITED THE POWERHOUSE FIRE. THERE'S SOME DEBATE ABOUT THAT WE DETAIN INSURANCE CLAIM ON THAT. OKAY SO THEN THEN THE NEXT QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE WE ARE MOVE OUT OF PUBLIC COMMENT QUICKLY -- IS WHEN THAT HAPPENED TO PAYS. WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE PAID INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE ARE RETIREMENT ARE INSURANCE COVERAGE PAID? ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON THAT. BUT THEN WE CAME BACK FOR INSURANCE NEXT YEAR INSURANCE WENT UP FROM THE BLUE TWENTY MILLIONS TO THE MID THIRTY MILLIONS. AND ARE COVERAGE REDUCED BY ABOUT SIXTY FIVE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO US SO. ULTIMATELY. THERE IS A SLIGHT COSTS INCREASED THE RATE PAYER THERE'S MORE RISK EXPOSURE TO THE RATE PAYERS [inaudible] JUST [inaudible] ALL OF WHEN THERE IS A FIRE DISCOUNT FIRE COME AND INVESTIGATE. HE IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THE FIRE IS SADDAM IF WE HAVE A FIRE SO THE POWERHOUSE FIRE THEY JUST MENTION. CORD ON THE ACTUALLY IN THE ANGELES NATIONAL FORCE WAS OUTSIDE THE CITY A POWER PLANTS ALONG ARE ACCURATE COMMITTEE AND SO HELLFIRE WOULD INVOLVE WITH THAT. THE END WOULD HAVE DONE INVESTIGATION TYPICAL FIRES THAT WE MIGHT SEE AND THAT MAY AFFECT US. WOULD BE IN THE CITY AND SO LA CITY FIRE WOULD YOU TAKE THE LEAD ON THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. SCRUBBING THE FLOORS. GOOD AFTERNOON -- DESPITE WAY THAT TILBURG IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST APPEAR USE PRETTY VIOS SOME PERCEPTION OF IT -- WE ARE SMALL -- PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY BUT OUR AGENCY WHICH IS A COLLECTIVE OF SIXTEEN PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SO WE DO SHARE A LOT OF INFORMATION BETWEEN -- EACH OF THE MEMBERS OF ANTI QUE FOR HILLS FOR EXPLICITLY WE HAVE FOUR SQUARE MILES VERY SMALL SERVER TERRITORY BUT SIXTY MILES OF LINE WITHIN THAT SIR TOWARDS APPARENTLY DANCE. WE DO HAVE OVERHEAD LINES THAT RUN THROUGH ELEVATED AREAS OF FIRE RISK -- EVEN THOUGH -- SMALL PEEL YOU WE HAVEA VERY HIGH SYSTEM RELIABILITY SO WE HAVE A VERY VERY LOW FREQUENCY OF POWER OUTAGES AND THAT'S DO A LARGELY TO OUR MAINTENANCE SO. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO -- FOR MITIGATION -- ANNUALLY WE TRIM OUR TREES SO WE DON'T PICK SECTIONS AND SAY EVERY THREE YEARS WE'RE GONNA VISIT THAT SECTION BASED ON GROWTH WE LOOK AT OURS TIRE SYSTEM EACH YEAR. SPECIFICALLY FOR TREE TRIMMING WE REQUIRE THE CLEARANCE FROM A CONTRACTOR TO BE A MINIMUM OF FOUR FEET SO TYPICALLY THAT MEANS THEY TAKE SOME FEET OF CLEARANCE FROM THE WIRES -- THEY TAKE ADDITIONAL CLEARANCE FOR WIRE SAS TO THE COMEDY WHAT HAPPENS DURING HEAVY LOADING OR HIGHER TEMPERATURES OF THE WIRE WE DO WORK WITH PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE REMOVE TREES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BLOW INTO THE LINES FROM OUTSIDE THE RIGHT OF WAYS ON THAT TAKE SOME WILLINGNESS TO PROPERTY OWNERS BUT THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE CAN HAVE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. COME WITH THE TO PROACTIVELY RE CONDUCTOR -- OUR LINES REBUILD AIRLINES SO WE LOOK AT WE CONDUCTORS ARE POTENTIALLY HAVE THE RISK OF FALLING DOWN DURING HIGH WINDS. WE CONDUCTED THOSE REBUILD THOSE BEFORE THEIR END OF LIFE -- WE ALSO LOOK AT SPACING REQUIREMENTS SPREAD THOSE OUT THAT HELPS -- WITH THE FACE TO FACE -- CONTACT. THEM WE ALSO LOOK AT WHAT WAS MENTIONED BY THE REALLY PALE THE CAO FIRES RECOMMENDATION FOR SUBJECT POLLS OR OR CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT THAT POTENTIALLY SHOULD BE CHANGED OUT FOR OTHER EQUIPMENT THAT ARE MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THE WILD AND URBAN AREAS -- AND AGAIN WE DO VISUAL INSPECTIONS FOR GEO ONE SIXTY FIVE WE DO THE DETAILS TAXES FOR ONE PIC -- SIXTY FIVE WE REALLY LOOK AT THE GEO NINETY FIVE STANDARDS ONE SIXTY FIVE AS A MINIMUM STANDARD. AND WE LOOK TO EXCEED THOSE WHERE WE CAN. COME AND WE ALSO CONSIDER BEST PRACTICES OF THE FEATHER UTILITIES SO. FUTURE ACTIONS AND IN THIS FALLS INTO THIS RANGE OF SHARING OF INFORMATION WE ARE LOOKING AT REFLECT DAYS CUTTING OUT RE CLOSING -- TO AVOID THAT RISK AND WE DON'T FEEL. WE WE THINK WE CAN JUST CUT THOSE OUT AND TAKE THE RISK OF POTENTIALLY HAVING SUSTAINED OUTAGES -- WE'RE LOOKING AT STAFFING -- NO SONNY. NO I I TURN MY PHONE OFF IN VERY EARLY IN THIS CONFERENCE TO AVOID THAT. SOMEONE WANTS WANTS YOU TO WRAP UP. MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S THE MUSIC. THAT'S THE MUSIC -- OKAY SO. FOR EXPEDIENCY -- SO WE DO LOOK AT THOSE WOULD LOOK AT A STAFFING AND AGAIN YOU KNOW LOOKING OLD BEST. IS THAT ARE COMING FOR ITS OR CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR TO BECAUSE IT THIS IS A NEW NORMAL -- WE CAN'T DO THE SAME OLE SAME OLE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW WAY TO OPERATE OR UTILITY IN ADOPTING THE S. TECHNOLOGIES. ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT WHAT WORKS FOR LA WHAT WORKS FOR PGD MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT FIT FOR SMALL PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY. I MEAN WITHIN FOUR SQUARE MILES I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO FLY DRONES AROUND OUR TOWN. I THINK WE CAN SEND OUR GUYS HUMANS OUT THERE TO LOOK AT OUR LINES AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY OF THERE'S A BENEFIT THERE. BUT THE PUBLIC SEES HUMANS ON THE GROUND WORKING -- LOVE TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S IS THERE IS A GOOD PLACE FOR AN EXIT THERE'S ABOUT PLACE -- FOR ONE THINGS UNIQUE ABOUT HILLS BURGERS WE ARE BOTH THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY AND WE ARE A CUSTOMER OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WE RECEIVE OUR TRANSMISSIONS SERVICES FROM P. GINNY SO WE'RE WORKING WITH PJ NEED TO FIGURE OUT. WHEN THEY DE ENERGIZE OUR TOWN THEY'D DE ENERGIZE OUR TRANSMISSION SERVICE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO THE REST OF OUR COMMUNITY? SO WE LOSE ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY FACILITIES WE LOSE ALL OUR PUBLIC WATER. WASTEWATER COLLECTION SYSTEMS WE LOSE THE HOSPITAL HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICE HOW DO WE PROVIDE THAT PUBLIC SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY. DURING THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS AS WELL AS LOOKING AT THE CONTINGENCY OF PAY IF WE DID HAVE A RED FLAG WARNING AND I DID WANT TO GET ITS CONDITION OF DE ENERGIZING WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO WE NOTICE OUR CUSTOMERS THERE. SO IT'S VERY UNIQUE BUT THAT THE BENEFIT IS -- I'M THE UTILITY TRACTOR I'M OVER THE WATER MORE THE WASTEWATER I'M OVER ELECTRIC AND SO I CAN WORK WITH THOSE GUYS TO SAY HEY WE NEED TO BUILD THE PLAN TO RUN GENERATORS AROUND SO THAT. WHEN THE SOLICITATIONS LOSE POWER WE DON'T HAVE RAW SEWAGE SPILLING INTO THE STREETS DURING THE SO THAT? AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT OUTAGES UNDER TWELVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY -- TWO DAYS FIVE DAYS THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE IN ALL THOSE NUANCES HAVE TO BE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE THIS ONE SOLUTION MAY CREATE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES -- BUT PUBLIC OWNS WORD WERE SITUATED TO DO THOSE TO LOOK AT THOSE SAYING SADDAM. AGAIN LIKE SAID WORK CLOSELY WITH FLEAS FIRE ON THE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO TRAFFIC SIGNALS [inaudible] VERY. IT'S ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS -- AND AND ALSO THE CITY PROVIDE SHELTER FOR BOTH. EVENTS THAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE CITY AS WELL AS OUTSIDE THE CITY AND SEWER LOOK AT THAT SITUATION IS OKAY IF WE DO GET INTO THESE DINNERS AND ADVANCE. WHAT STE TYPE OF SERVICES DO WE NEED TO PROVIDE IN OUR PREPARED TO PROVIDE THOSE ITH AND WITHOUT POWER? SO -- WITHOUT IT WOULD OPEN IT UP FOR THE QUESTIONS. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF OUR PANEL. MISTER WOOD DISK A MINUTE I SHASTA WHEN QUESTION THAT MISTER OF SENATOR CANNELLA OUR PAST AND DO YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH DO YOU HAVE CHALLENGES IN GETTING PERMISSION TO DO -- YET HE STRUGGLES WITH OUR AGENCIES AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO DO. YOUR WHILE FIRE MITIGATION WORK. TO DO WE DON'T HILLS FOR DOESN'T HAVE LANCE THROUGH FEDERAL LANDS OUR STATE LANDS WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CHANNELS IS WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON WORKING WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS. OF OUR IS USER MORE WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES NOT TOO MUCH OF THE STATE AGENCIES AND WE WILL GET PERMITS BUT IS A MONTHS LONG PROCESS TO DO WHAT SHE HE KNEW PRETTY CLEAR. AND AND I'D ECHO THAT THAT'S THE U. S. FOR SERVICE AND WE COULD USE SOME ASSISTANCE AND ARE. EXPANDING RIGHT AWAY AND AND FUEL LOADING IN AND FOR AND HE WAS. IN FEDERAL FORESTS ARE US FORCES IT'S BE ITS MAJOR PROBLEM AND WE AND WE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THEIR ATTENTION IN GETTING THEM GETTING ACTION. THANK YOU SEEN OTHER QUESTIONS WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IF WE NEED -- TO CIRCLING BACK AROUND WITH UNIT WITH ANY PARTICULAR FOLLOW UPS GO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND NOW. A TURN THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION OVER TO SENATOR DODD THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. I WE SAW THERE WAS MAYBE HALF A DOZEN -- SPEAKERS WE'RE GONNA GIVE A MINUTE EACH I'M SORRY HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GET YOUR POINT ACROSS TO US AND Y.. AND THEN ALSO WE WILL ACCEPT EVERYTHING ANY ABOUT. OF PAPERWORK OR ANYTHING COMMENTS IN WRITING AS WELL. PROCEED SIR RICHARD PIERCE FIRE CHIEF THE TO RUN FAR DISTRICT REPRESENTING OUT CAL CHIEFS FIRE DISTRICTS AND METRO CHIEFS -- EVERYTHING YOU SAID TODAY WAS NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEARTS AS YOU KNOW A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE AS A LARGE PORTION OF PART PORTION RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENTS WE AGREE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THESE INCIDENTS SMALL. AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION IMPROVE NOTIFICATION AND AND ARE A POSITION OF PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES -- AS WE USE TECHNOLOGY MOVING FORWARD WOULD LIKE TO MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE IF YOU CRAFT YOUR LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE ANY EXPERTISE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY SO THEE THERE'S WAY MORE PUBLIC COMMENT HERE THAN WHAT PEOPLE RAISE THEIR HAND. SO HERE'S THE DEAL WHAT I WHAT THE COMMENTS LIMITED TO WAS WHAT WE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES THAT WILL HAVE A HEARING ON THAT AND LET'S KEEP IT TIGHT PLEASE XP CURVE. GOOD AFTERNOON STACEY HE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND COMMENTS THIS AFTERNOON.

WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT. I BLANCA CASTRO WITH AARP CALIFORNIA I JUST WANNA FOR SMALL SAY THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT SAFETY AND MITIGATION PLANS -- I'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THE UTILITIES ABOUT ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING WHAT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT JUST REMIND EVERYBODY? WE CANNOT DEPEND ON THE RATEPAYERS ONLY TO BE PAYING FOR ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY AND MITIGATION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN. SO I JUST ASK YOU TO PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOME. AND SO SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH MAY NOT SEEM A LOT BUT THEN YOU INCREASE THAT WITH A FIXED INCOME IT DOES IMPACT THEM. SO PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND REMEMBER THE GREAT PAIRS THANK YOU NEXT. OUR CHILDREN JIM FINNIGAN VOLUNTEER WITH AIR P. -- WE WOULD WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE UTILITY COMPANIES ABOUT PLANNING A MITIGATION. THE KEY QUESTION I HAVE IS WHO PAYS FOR THAT THEY SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING IT BUT NOT THE RATEPAYERS THANK YOU. WE CAN A ALL RETIRED BATTALION CHIEF FOR CAL FIRE -- I REALLY LIKED HILLS BERG I MEAN. THEY TRIM THE TREES. IT WOULD YEAR RIGHT DOWN TO IT GANG BESIDES ALL OF THE OBFUSCATION. IT'S REAL SIMPLE. GET OUT TRIM THE TREES THEN YOU WON'T YOU DON'T HAVE THE SPARK AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE FIRE -- I'M HERE REPRESENTING CAN HAIL NOT CAL FIRE BUT IF YOU GUYS CREATED -- CAL FIRE ENFORCEMENT GROUP. THAT ONE OUT AND ENFORCE THE LAW VIGOROUSLY ENFORCE THE LAW YOU WOULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT. THANKS THANKS MISTER HLE NEXT SPEAKER POLICE OPERATION. GOOD EVENING MEMBERS ROBERT SPIEGEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AND GENERALLY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF APPROVING THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF OUR UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AS THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PERSONAL PERISHABLE AT COMMODITIES DEPEND ON A RELIABLE ACTUAL SERVICE HOWEVER. ANY COST OR ANY COST OF ANY IMPROVEMENTS MUST BE BALANCED BETWEEN THOSE UP PLACE ON RATEPAYERS AND BOTH PAIR PAID BY SHAREHOLDERS AS NEWPROCESSES WERE DEVELOPED FOR IMPLEMENTING PLANS RELATED TO HARDING UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. EXPENDITURES MUST BE EVALUATED TO ENSURE THAT RATEPAYERS BENEFIT AS MUCH AS SHAREHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PETER. I CARE COSTS AT THE PERSONAL INSURANCEFEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THURSDAY'S HEARING. HOWEVER I JUST CAN'T LEAVE UNADDRESSED THE STATEMENT THAT'S MISLEADING THAT CALIFORNIA ALABAMA ARE THE ONLY TWO STATES HAVE INVERSE CONDEMNATION. ALL STATES AND THE CONSTITUTION HOW INVERSE CONDEMNATION IT'S JUST THE CALIFORNIA HAS MUCH MORE MUCH LARGER AND MORE POWERFUL I USE AND FOR THAT REASON THE STATE'S APART THE STATE CUP CALIFORNIA'S PRACTICALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THINK IT NOT SURPRISING CARE YOU PROVIDE. SO IT WAS A NATION THAT STUFF JUST TEASING GO AHEAD. THAT SPEAKER. CATHERINE THOUGHT ABOUT AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION I'M I TO I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. C.

JOHN MEMBERS JOHN OR WOULD IT INDEPENDENT TURNS AGENTS AND BROKERS SURPLUS LINES ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE WHOLESALERS. AND AGAIN ON THE COMMENT I JUST WANTED TO REAL CONTEXT THERE'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORLDWIDE IN REASSURANCE THERE'S ABOUT AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE BONDS AT ALTERNATIVE INSURANCE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO ALL BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WASN'T BIGGEST. CATASTROPHE YEAR IN THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN THOSE APPROXIMATELY. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE. ONLY A HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION OF THAT WAS INSURED SO THAT LEAVES A NO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS JUST IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET THAT WAS STILL AVAILABLE PLUS THE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES. MILLION OTHER COST MUCH HIGHER YES BUT IT AVAILABLE IS OUT THERE IS SOMETHING MAYBE YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO FURTHER. I'M BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKETPLACE THANK YOU THANK YOU. KURT JOHNSON SONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION AND IN MY PAST LIFE -- I HAD A THIRTY YEAR CAREER MUNICIPAL PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND BOTH THAT CAREER PLUS A COLLEGE THE DISCUSSION YOU HAD TODAY I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD. AND A WHILE TRAGEDIES OF HAPPENED IN THE PAST WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE FUTURE. BUT ALSO -- FOR MY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BACKGROUND I KNOW WASN'T SPECIFICALLY BROUGHT UP TODAY BUT RECOVERY BONDS ARE CRITICAL. OF THE IDEA THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NEW STANDARDS OF MAINTENANCE AND ACTUALLY. WAYS TO PAY FOR IT THE DON'T ADVERSELY IMPACT A RATE PRAYER PIRES'S IS CRITICAL SO. THANK YOU IT THANKS MISTER JOHNSON IN FAIRNESS TO MISS CROSS YOU YOU VIOLATED IT TOO NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DIANE ROGERS AND PRESIDENT CEO THE RANCHO CORDOVA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AS A BUSINESS ORGANIZATION WE'RE PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF OUR MEMBERS WE CONSIDER THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON OUR ENVIRONMENT RELIABILITY. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY A WRETCH ABOVE THE CALIFORNIA RANCHO CORDOVA CANNOT PROVIDE THOSE GOODS AND SERVICESREQUIRED BY OUR FAMILIES SCHOOLS AND SERVICES. IF THOSE SERVICES ARE UNRELIABLE. STABLE UTILITIES ARE MUCH LIKE THE ADAGE OF A RISING TIDE RAISING ALL SHIPS WHEN SAFE RELIABLE AND COST EFFICIENT ENERGY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED EVERY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY AS WELL OFF SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE MARTINSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION TODAY AS WE REALLY DO THINK. THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON TO MAKE PROGRESS ON IN THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR WEEKS OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I WON'T VIOLATE THE RULE LIKE MY MY COUNTERPARTS TODAY BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE OUR OPPORTUNITY ON THURSDAY TO EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION. A TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AN INVERSE CONDEMNATION BUT I DID. BUT I DID. I DID WANT TO SAY THAT C. SECOND BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE ON TREE MORTALITY ON FORCE RESILIENCY AND I WOULD CONCUR WITH MY THE COMMENTS FROM THE THE RURAL COUNTIES THAT THIS IS ONE PORTION. OF AN OVERALL LANDSCAPE ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON AND THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION TO AYE THANK YOU.

SO THANK YOU [inaudible] YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE TOOK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA CONGENERS IN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WESTERN ART PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION YOU SEE FARMERS LEAGUE AND VARIOUS OTHER OUTSIDE INDUSTRY'S ALWAYS RATE PAYERS THE FOURTEEN SECONDS ALREADY WAS JUST THE NAMES GO AHEAD I COULD I GIVE YOU MARK. A WE JUST WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE -- DIED REPAIRS ARE THE ONES PAYING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS SO WHEN I USE ARE SITTING UP HERE SAYING THAT THEY'VE MADE INVESTMENTS IN SAFETY THEY'VE MADE INVESTMENT AND THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S THE RATE PAYERS PAYING FOR THOSE COSTS AND WE DON'T WE THINK MOVING FORWARD THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD EVALUATE. HOW THE SHAREHOLDERS CAN ALSO SHARE IN THAT COST IS NOT ON THE RATE PAYERS? ONE WAY TO SPECIFICALLY DO THAT IT IS -- THROUGH AUDITING WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER AT THE DO YOU SEE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE PLANS IF -- IF THE THESE PLANS ARE APPROVED AT THE P. YOU SEE AND THE UTILITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTING WILD FIRE. MITIGATION MEASURES AND HURTING THE SYSTEM AND DON'T DO THAT WITH THE FUNDS RATE PAYERS HAVE GIVEN AND THEN THESE BIG FIRES HAPPEN WE DON'T THINK RATE PAIR SHOULD BE ON THE HOOK FOR PAYING FOR HARDING NOT SYSTEM IF THEY'VE ALREADY PAID ON THE BACK AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE CO CHAIRMAN A CITY -- MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANY FACTORS IN TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE FARM BUREAU -- OR A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAT -- BOOTH RATEPAYERS SHAREHOLDERS IN THE STATE ALL PARTICIPATE AND THIS A LOT IN LIKE IN MAINTAINING ELECTRIC RID -- THERE FOR ALL PARTIES UNITY DID SHARE THAT RESPONSIBILITY ING I SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE THE STATE IN THAT DISCUSSION. REDUCING THE FIRE RISK REDUCES THE RISK OF RELEASE OF CARBON SO ISSUES SUCH AS A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND MIGHT BE AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR HELPING TO ADDRESS OUT THAT WOULD HELP MITIGATE THICK INCREASE COST -- TO RATEPAYERS SHAREHOLDERS ALL IT IT FROM INVESTMENTS IN THAT SYSTEM AND THEREFORE SHOULD ALSO BE AT THE TABLE -- IT RATHER THAN JUST ALL THE PRESSURE FALLING TO REPAIRS ON THAT THANK YOU YOU. SIR YOU IN THE LINE RIGHT NOW BACK YOU IN THE BASIN. NO NO I I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE NOT THAT'S THE LAST BEAKER NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ A MAY HAVE OF TURN.

WE EXPECT BILLIONS MORE WILL BE SPEND THE NEXT FEW YEARS BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER. EYES ADOPTED BY THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE SHOULD REALLY I'M HAVE A PROCESS THAT PROTECTS RATEPAYERS -- AND WE THINK THAT -- THE DIRECTION THAT THE CPC HAS BEEN GOING AS FAR GENERAL USING GENERATE CASES IS REALLY GOOD DIRECTION AGO WE ALSO BELIEVE -- GOOD DIRECTION THAT THE GOVERNOR PUT HIS PROPOSED REGARDING THE SAFETY AD AND PREVENTION EXPENDITURES TO HAVE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH MAKING SURE THAT THE MONEY IS WELL SPENT AND SPENT IN WAY THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE. AND ALSO PROTECT RATEPAYERS WE THINK IT GOES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT PIECE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO WE URGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. WE WILL HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS ON PERHAPS THE ON THAT PIECE PARTICULAR THANKS SIR.
