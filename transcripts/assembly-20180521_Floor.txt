THERE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS MAY BE NECESSARY SUCH AS WHEN THERE'S A RISK OF RETALIATORY HARM. OR DURING THIS TIME IN HISTORY WHEN A PLAINTIFF LEGITIMATELY FEARS THE REVEALING ONE'S IDENTITY COULD SUBJECT HER TO DEPORTATION. UNLIKE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE STANDARDS FOR PLAINTIFFS TO PURSUE LITIGATION WITH THE PSEUDONYM. OUR STATE DOES NOT HAVE SUCH A STANDARD OR BILL WOULD ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY IN LITIGATION AND REQUIRE COURTS TO CONSIDER A VARIETY RELEVANT FACTORS. A PARTY COULD CHALLENGE THE USE OF A PSEUDONYM AND OF A COURT ORDERS AN ANONYMOUS LITIGANT TO BE IDENTIFIED THAT PARTY COULD CHOOSE TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

AND AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE WESTERN HERITAGE OF THE RANCHO AREA THAT EXTENDS FROM THE RIVERSIDE RANCHO AREA IN GLENDALE TO THE RANCHO MASTER PLAN IN BURBANK. THIS BILL RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS NOW LEGALLY DEFINED AREA KNOWN AS THE RANCHO MASTER PLAN. THIS AREA IS CONSTANTLY AT RISK OF SPEED INCREASES DESPITE BEING AN EQUESTRIAN ZONE. AS THE HORSE OWNER MYSELF WHO'S WRITTEN FOR YEARS IN THIS AREA I'VE SEEN THE INCREASED SPEED AND TRAFFIC IN AN AREA THAT'S BOUND BY TO FREEWAYS. AND WHICH IS OFTEN A ROUTE TAKEN BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR PRESENCE OF COURSES CAN BE EXPECTED IN THE AREA. THE RANCHO AREA HAS ROUGHLY SEVENTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS WITH ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OWNING HORSES IN THE AREA. THE AREA HAS BEEN AN EQUESTRIAN HAVEN RIGHT IN THE HEART OF LOS ANGELES SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FIVE AS AMENDED ALLOWS THIS AREA TO INCORPORATE EQUESTRIAN SAFETY AND TO HOW TRAFFIC ENGINEERING STUDIES ARE CONDUCTED ONLY IN THIS TO FIND AREA. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS ALLOWED THE CITIES OF NORCO AND THE DEVELOPMENT IN ORANGE. ORANGE PARK ACTS ACRES TO CONSIDER EQUESTRIAN SAFETY AND HOW THEY CONDUCT SPEED SURVEYS THESE EFFORTS ARE TO KEEP. HORSES SAFE IN URBAN SETTINGS.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ARE. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO GAVE AN INCREDIBLY ELOQUENT. PRAYER. THIS MORNING WHICH. LAYS THE. THE ARGUMENT FOR AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT. THIS IS A BILL THAT I INTRODUCED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHOSE EXPANSION OF WHAT SENATOR SKINNER ON. PASSED AND GOT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR TO EXPAND THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING WERE THE GOOD BOUNCE RESTRAINING ORDERS A VERY SIMPLE IDEA. THAT. MODELED AFTER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS THAT YOU CAN GO TO COURT. IF YOU BELIEVE SOMEONE IS A DANGER SHOULD NOT HAVE A GUN IT ALLOWS PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN LAW. THAT IF YOU'RE A FAMILY MEMBER AND IF YOU ARE A CURRENT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL. TO BE ABLE TO GO TO COURT AND HOW THAT HAPPENED. WELL UNFORTUNATELY SENSE THEN. FIFTEEN NUMEROUS SHOOTINGS OCCUR LIKE THE ONE ON FRIDAY UNFORTUNATELY. SCHOOLS PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEARLY KNEW THAT A STUDENT WAS POTENTIALLY A PERSON WHO I SHOULDN'T HAVE A GUN I SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A GUN WILL BE ABLE TO HELP WE SAW THAT KIND OF SITUATION. THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAPPEN TO PARKLAND IN PARK LAND WE HAD EIGHT INDIVIDUAL WHO CLEARLY OF THE PRINCIPAL KNEW THE TEACHERS KNEW THEY COULD HAVE USED THIS TYPE. OF. GOING BONTA STRAINING ORDER WE ALSO SEE IT INSTANCES AROUND COWORKERS SO THAT'S WHY. WE WANT TO HAVE THE INTENTION OF EXPANDING IT TO CO WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS PEOPLE ARE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS. FACULTY PROFESSORS WE DID TAKE OUT FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. NOBLE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DID NOT WANT TO BE INCLUDED SO WE TOOK THEM OUT WE HEARD THEM. OUR THIS BILL DID PASS LEGISLATURE TO GET VETOED FROM THE GOVERNOR OF MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN AGAIN FLORIDA TO THE GOVERNOR BELIEVE THE TIMES ARE DIFFERENT. THAN THE MODE THE MOOD IS DIFFERENT. WE NOW HAVE AFTER TWO YEARS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF THESE RESTRAINING ORDERS ALMOST ALL OF THEM ENTIRELY. OUR HOUSE FOR BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE FEEL THAT THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE WRONG PEOPLE. ALL I CONTINUE TO HAVE. GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH. PART WITH PARTY MEMBERS WERE PASSED THE ISLAND WITH THE DO HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION THE SECOND HOUSE TO MAKE THIS AN EVEN STRONGER BILL AND EVEN A BETTER BILL. I MEAN REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE. BIPARTISAN PATH FOR WITH THIS BILL. BUT TODAY AGAIN ON THE HEELS OF A BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENED IN TEXAS. I REALLY DO ASK THAT WE DON'T JUST SEND THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS BUT THAT WE DO. SOME ACTION BE SENSIBLE ACTION TO OUR STUDENTS TO FAMILIES WHO REALLY ARE SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND WONDERING WHAT WE CAN DO. TO STEM THE VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR VOTE ON AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY. THANK EXTINGUISHER GIPSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ARE RISE AND SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT I THINK THE AUTHOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO. BRINGING IS A GOOD OF MEASURE BEFORE THIS BODY WITHOUT BEING REDUNDANT I THINK THAT HE SUMMED IT UP AND MY TALK POINTS REFLECTS SOME OF THINGS THAT HE SAID ALSO. DOCTOR WEBER WITH HER ELOQUENCE IN HER PRAYER I WOULD SAY THAT WE REMEMBER. THE SHOOTER THE SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE AT DOUGLASS HIGH SCHOOL. OF IN PARKLAND FLORIDA LAST FEBRUARY SEVENTEEN. YOUNG PEOPLE WERE KILLED. OF THIS BILL IF IT WAS AN ACT OF CERTAINLY WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO KNOW INDIVIDUAL. WHO MAY BE SUFFERING FROM IT A MENTAL ILLNESS OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE TO GET THE KIND OF HELP? BY PROVIDING INFORMATION SO THAT A RESTRAINING ORDER COULD IN FACT BE AFFECTED SO THIS INDIVIDUAL WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS I THINK IT MAKES SENSE AND CERTAINLY. I ENCOURAGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS WOULD AYE VOTE. NAMES GIPSON ISRAEL'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ARE TO RISE IS A JOINT AUTHORED AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT. WE SEE THE PLAYING. WITH SOON A PLAY OUT OVER AND OVER IN OUR NATION. A PERSON WITH SEVERE MENTAL PROBLEMS IT GETS ACCESS TO GUNS AND TARGETS THE MOST INNOCENT AMONG US. AS WE'VE JUST WITNESSED LAST FRIDAY THE HORRIBLE EVENTS OF SANTA FE HIGH SCHOOL IN TEXAS. A REPEAT OF A HORROR WE SEEM TO SEE ALMOST WEEKLY. IT'S HORRIFYING TRAGEDIES ALL SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. GUNS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE THAT CLEARLY SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. AFTER THESE TRAGEDIES THE STORIES ALWAYS EMERGE THAT THE PERPETRATOR LEFT CLUES IN SOME CASES CLEAR INTENT. AS TO WHAT THEY PLANNED TO DO. NEIGHBORS FRIENDS AND RELATIVES STEP FORWARD WITH ACCOUNTS OF BIZARRE BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF THE SHOOTER. CLEARLY REVEALING WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD. ACCESS TO GUNS. WE OFTEN DEBATE THE EXTENT OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT ON THIS FLOOR BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH THE LEGAL RIGHT TO OWN GUNS. AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT IS A COMMONSENSE EXPANSION OF OUR EXISTING GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER LAW. THAT WE WILL ALLOW THOSE MOST OFTEN IN THE POSITION TO IDENTIFY THAT A PERSON IS A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS TO REQUEST A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. CANNOT REMAIN SILENT WE MUST DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PREVENT THESE EVENTS FROM TAKING PLACE WHETHER BE INCREASING THE USE OF THESE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. TO INCREASING ACCESS SOME FUNDING TO EARLY INTERVENTION FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WHEN WE REACHED THE POINT IN OUR U. S. HISTORY WERE MORE CHILDREN THE BEEN KILLED AND SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THEN U. S. SERVICE PERSONNEL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WE'VE REACHED A CRISIS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. AND I KNOW WE CAN DO SOMETHING. NO CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO BE WORRIED THAT WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING THAT THEY MAY BE ENTERING A WAR ZONE. I WANT NEXT YEAR WHEN MY. COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO GOES TO SEE HER NANA AND IS THE HOUSE TOWARD THE CHILDREN I WANT HER TO BE ABLE TO SAY. THAT THEY ARE FINE. I THANK THE MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR HIS TIRELESS EFFORTS ON THIS BILL AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. NAMES RISK. MR MERCHANT SHE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MEMBERS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. HOW MANY MORE IS SCHOOL SHOOTINGS DO WE NEED TO SEE BEFORE WE START PASSING COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY LAWS? I'VE ALWAYS RESPECTED THE RIGHT OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS TO OWN. AND YOU AND POSSESS GUNS RESPONSIBLY BUT CLEARLY. AS WE EVERY NEW SHOOTING. WE'RE BEING REMINDED THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. AS A DAD WITH A DAUGHTER IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL. I'M ESPECIALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE PROVISION OF THIS BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WE'VE SEEN AS A. AS A MY COLLEAGUE MS RAISE THEY INDICATED THAT THE STUDENTS KNOW. WHO THE PROBLEM STUDENTS ARE? THE EMPLOYEES KNOW WHO THE PROBLEM STUDENTS ARE. WE NEED TO EMPOWER THEM GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO FILE FOR THESE GUN RESTRAINING ORDERS SO THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY THE GUNS FROM THE MENTALLY ILL AND THOSE WHO PRESENT DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. SO THAT WE CAN FIGHT. COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY AND OUR SCHOOLS AYE ASTRAEA AYE VOTE. MISS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL FOR COMING TO MY OFFICE IN SPEAKING WITH ME. WE TRIED VERY HARD TO COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT OF HOW TO MAKE THIS BILL SOMETHING THAT I COULD SUPPORT AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THERE. BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE ATTEMPT. IS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER SAT NAPS WITH THE NRA SO YOU KNOW SPURS FOR EVERYTHING. I. I DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH THIS BILL WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT. THAT IT IS EXPERTS HAY IN HERE MEANING THAT. YOUR WEAPONS COULD BE TAKEN AWAY A JUDGE COULD DECIDE THAT WITHOUT YOU EVEN BEING THERE TO SHARE YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY. ON THAT THAT COULD TAKE TWENTY ONE DAYS FREE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THAT IS CONCERNING TO ME. THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE TO SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN PARTICULAR. I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT IT'S HORRIFIC. BUT THIS BILL. WOULDN'T HAVE PREVENTED THAT. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MINERS PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST SCHOOL SHOOTING THAT YOUNG MAN NOT ONLY DID HE TAKE WEAPONS THAT WERE NOT HIS OWN WERE NOT REGISTERED TO HIM. HE WASN'T EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE THEM. SEOUL THIS TYPE OF BILL I JUST I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO USE. THAT SCENARIO AS THE REASON FOR THIS BILL. THIS SAME EXACT BILL WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR. BECAUSE A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER HAD ALREADY BEEN SIGNED BY HIM ONE THAT I THINK WAS. MORE NARROW. AND SO THIS BILL CAME FORWARD AGAIN LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SAID IT WAS TOO SOON TO EXTEND IT. I'M WITH WHICH I AGREE. I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN COLLABORATE AND PERHAPS DO A BILL TOGETHER. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE'S A PERSON IN THIS ROOM WHO DOESN'T. WANT TO DO SOMETHING. FIND A WAY TO STOP THESE TYPES OF THINGS FROM HAPPENING. BUT WHENEVER ANYBODY SAYS WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT USUALLY MEANS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND SO THEY END UP DOING WHATEVER. COMES TO MIND AND SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT IT IS. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE. MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IS MEMBERS. THIS ISSUE THAT HITS VERY CLOSE TO HOME FOR ME. YOU KNOW. IN THE COMMUNITY OF RANCHO TO HEMA. WE HAD A SIMILAR. INCIDENT WHERE LIKELY NO STUDENTS WERE KILLED BUT WE HAD A GUN THEN. GO THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD SHOOTING UP HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. AND THEN GOING ON TO A SCHOOL CAMPUS. RAMMING THE FENCE DOWN. AND THEY GO IN THERE AND ACTUALLY SHOOTING IN THE CLASSROOMS. AND YOU ABOUT FOR THE HERO WAS A AM. OF TEACHERS AND STAFF THERE THAT DAY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE. DIRE SITUATION I GREW UP. NOW. IN A SMALL COMMUNITY NOT VERY HARD FROM NOT VERY FAR FROM LENDERS TIES SCHOOL WHICH WAS ONE OF THE. VERY FIRST SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY I MEMBER THAT. YOU THE FEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THAT HAD. FRIENDS. YOU KNOW WHOSE FAMILY HAD GONE THROUGH THAT. AND NOBODY WANTS TO EVER BE IN THAT SITUATION I THINK WE ALL I FOR ONE BELIEVE WE DO NEED TO TAKE ACTION. TO HELP ENSURE THAT THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN. TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP PREVENT THEM FROM HAPPENING. BUT ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS HOW THIS IS BEING TEED UP TODAY AS IS THIS IS THE. THIS IS A SOLUTION TO THAT. AND THAT. ALMOST SAID HEY IF YOU'RE NOT DOWN WITH THIS IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR POLICY MEASURE THAT YOU'RE NOT WELL INTO. TO TAKE ACTION THERE'S MANY THINGS WE CAN DO. RESTRAINING ORDERS ARE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL. THEY ARE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL. WHEN THEY'RE ENFORCED. IN THE CASE OF GRANTED TO HIM OF THE GOVERNMENT HAD A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE HAD ACTUALLY FIRED ON HIS NEIGHBORS. AND SO THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM ALREADY. BECAUSE OF THAT INCIDENT. THE DA WAS ABLE TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM. HE TURNED IN ONE HANDGUN. TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF. BUT GUESS WHAT IN THE MEANTIME IN THE EIGHT MONTHS SINCE HE HAD THAT RESTRAINING ORDER. HE GOT OTHER GUNS E ACTUALLY BUILT HIS OWN GUN. ANY HAD OTHER GUNS HE DID TURN IT AND NOBODY BOTHERED TO ACTUALLY GO AND ENFORCE A RESTRAINING ORDER SO LET'S NOT. STANDARD SALE IF WE PASS THIS BILL WE'RE GONNA STOP THE SEAS BECAUSE THERE'S ONE THING WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU HAVE TO ENFORCE THE RESTRAINING ORDERS. WE HAVE A PROGRAM. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. RUNS CALLED THE APPS PROGRAM. DISPOSED TO GO TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE RESTRAINING ORDERS AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACTUAL HISTORY OF DOING VIOLENT THINGS WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDERS AND THEREFORE ON THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST DOJ IS SUPPOSED TO GO TO THEIR HOMES AND DISARM THEM. THEY TAKE THE GUNS AWAY. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DOING IT. IN THIS IS BEEN MENTIONED MANY MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. THAT WE STILL HAVE THIS HUGE BACKLOG WITH THE APP'S PROGRAM. WE GAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAR THEY STILL HAVEN'T DONE. SO WHERE IS THE DEMAND ON DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS JOB OF GETTING THE GUNS AT A DANGEROUS PEOPLE. THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE WITH THIS BILLS IT DOES BROADLY EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT CAN GO IN AND. AND GET AN EX PARTE AGAIN EX PARTE MEANS YOU DON'T GET TO COME IN TO DEFEND YOURSELF. YOU DON'T GET TO COME IN AND TELL THE JUDGE WHY YOU SHOULDN'T. HAVE THE SEX AND HOW THIS. TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER PUT ON AGAINST YOU YOU SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. M. SUMMER THEY JUST WORKED WITH YOU THAT DOESN'T KNOW YOU. I MEAN THAT'S WHY WE MADE IT. THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WAS SAY A FAMILY MEMBER OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL. THEY WOULD GET THESE RESTRAINING ORDER SO WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT INTRUSION ON PEOPLE'S. RIGHTS. AND WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A HISTORY. OF COMMITTING CRIMES. THAT'S A BIG DEFICIT I THINK WE ALSO NEED I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE. HAVE MORE SECURITY AT OUR SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND SOME OF SAID TO ME WELL YOU KNOW THEY HAD SCHOOL OFFICERS AT SOME OF THESE CAMPUSES AND IT DIDN'T STOP ANYTHING WELL. WE HAD RESTRAINING ORDERS IN PLACE AND IT DIDN'T STOP. EVERYONE EITHER SO WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS THAT THERE'S. THERE'S A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH HERE. IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE ALL ONE POLICY OBJECTIVE IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN COMBAT SCHOOL VIOLENCE THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT THINGS WE CAN DO. AND I THINK WE'RE MISSING THE MUCH DEEPER QUESTION. THAT WE STILL DON'T TALK ABOUT. YEAH WE BAND A CERTAIN GUN. WE PUT CERTAIN TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER THING IN PLACE THIRTY SECONDS MISS HIM TELL OURSELVES ALWAYS SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT WHY WE ANSWERED SELF THIS QUESTION WHY IS IT THAT WE HAVE. TEENAGE KIDS GROWING UP IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ACTUALLY THINK. THE DOT IS A SOLUTION IS TO GO ON TO A CAMPUS. IT START SHOOTING THEIR FELLOW CLASSMATES. WHAT KIND OF A QUOTE AND WHAT WE ASK OURSELVES WHAT KIND OF A CULTURE WHAT HAVE WE DONE? AS A SOCIETY TO DEHUMANIZE. AND MAKE IT SO THESE KIDS ARE ACTUALLY GROWING UP IN THINKING THAT IT'S OKAY TO GO INTO THESE THINGS I THINK THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE DEEPER ISSUES. AT ISSUE HERE IT'S NOT JUST ONE POLICY. THAT WE PASS HERE TODAY THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE IT. PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT THEIR CHILDREN'S HAY OUT OF HER. TIME IS UP. ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE TODAY THANK YOU. MISTER PATTERSON YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU SPEAKER OUR. MEMBERS ARE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR TEN IS THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION STILL CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. I BELIEVE SO YES. THANK YOU UP WITH THAT. I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT WHEN THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION AND WHEN THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION BOTH ARE OPPOSED TO SOMETHING. IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WE ARE TO TAKE A REAL LONG LOOK AT BEFORE. WE PUSH THE GREEN BUTTON AND SO GIVEN ALL OF THE OTHER. COMMENTS A WITH RESPECT TO A. THE OPPOSITION OF EX PARTE ALL OF THAT. MEMBERS ARE WE SHOULD BE PUSHING THE RED BUTTON ON THIS ONE. ARE. THIS MEANS A WHOLE LOT MORE WORK. AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO MY FRIENDS ACROSS THE AISLE. THAT WHEN YOU DO THE WORK AND THE ACLU COMES OFF ITS OPPOSITION WELL THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD BRING IT BACK. MISTER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. ARE I TOOL I AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS ARE ON CIVIL LIBERTIES ON REGARDS THE EX PARTE. ARE BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROBABLY DIED DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE. ARE ON THE VAGUE TERM A CO WORKER. I AND I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AND DO YOU NEED TO BE TIGHTENED UP A BY THE AUTHOR I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A SUBJECT HIGHLY TO INTERPRETATION AFFECTED THINK LATER THIS THEY WILL PROBABLY BE ARGUING. ALL OUR INDEPENDENT TO A CONTRACTORS INDEED A CO WORKERS AYE AND HOW DOES THAT SITUATION INVOLVE ITSELF. AYE IN SO I THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE BAKED IF YOU WILL AYE IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO I URGE A NO VOTE. MISTER BLOOM YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU I I JUST WANTED TO GET UP AS. A ONE PERSON. ON ON THE FLOOR WHO ACTUALLY HAS EXPERIENCE OF OBTAINING EX PARTY ORDERS AND I WANT TO CLEAR THE AIR ABOUT. PROCESS BEHIND THEM AYE THEIR IT. IT'S NOT THE CASE ANNA AND I SHOULD SAY. IN ADDRESSING THIS THAT I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN RESTRAINING ORDERS AND EX PARTY RESTRAINING ORDERS WHERE GUNS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THREATENING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND I'M QUITE CERTAIN IN THOSE CASES. THAT VIOLENT ACTS WERE PREVENTED DO THEY WORK ALWAYS NO OF COURSE NOT THERE IS NO ONE. WAY THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE DOING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO EX PARTE ORDERS THERE IS DUE PROCESS IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S NO DUE PROCESS BUT WHEN A JUDGE SEES A SITUATION. WHERE IRREPARABLE HARM IS THREATENED IN THE MOMENT? THEN. SHOULDN'T WE WANT OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO HAVE THAT DISCRETION TO ENTER INTO INTO TO TO. MAKE IN ORDER. AND THEN WITHIN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THERE FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A HEARING. WHEN THE EX PARTY ORDER HAPPENS AND THEN THERE IS QUICKLY FOLLOWING THAT A HEARING WHERE ALL PARTIES ARE ALLOWED TO COME IN AND ARGUE THEIR CASE. AND I'VE SEEN SITUATIONS WHERE SOMETIMES THE ORDER ENDS VERY QUICKLY WHEN THE JUDGE HEARS FROM THE OTHER SIDE. BUT WE SHOULD ALLOW OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO HAVE DISCRETION OVER THIS ISSUE SO THAT IN THOSE LIMITED NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHERE A VIOLENT ACT CAN BE STOPPED. THIS IS ONE WAY WE CAN DO THAT ACCOMPLISHED THAT I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. NAMES ONE DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL THAT. I HAD NO IDEA THAT WAS TO TING WOULD BRING THIS BILL UP THIS MORNING. SO THAT WILL OF THOSE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS A PRAYER FROM MY HEART. CONCERNING WHAT WE HAVE FACED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND I'M NOT SURE IF WE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR CHILDREN ARE CONSTANTLY SAYING TO US. THEY'RE AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. THE FREEDOM WHAT HAPPENS. AS A GRANDMOTHER AND. AFRAID EVERY TIME MY GRAND CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL. AND I KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PARENTS ARE AFRAID ALSO. AND SURELY THIS IS A AN EXTREMELY LARGE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO FACE. AND WE DIDN'T GET HERE OVERNIGHT. WE WILL NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM OVERNIGHT. AND EVERYTHING YOU MENTIONED IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO. WE HAVE ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH. WE'RE WE HAVE ISSUES OF VALUES. WE HAVE HATRED THAT PEOPLE PROMOTE ON TELEVISION THAT COMES EVEN OUT OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. WE HAVE FOLKS WHO DISLIKE OF THE PEOPLE AND IF WE THINK THAT THAT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CHILDREN. IN OUR HOMES AND OUR COMMUNITIES WE ARE DELUSIONAL. EVERYTHING IS HURTING OUR CHILDREN RIGHT NOW. AND THE PAIN THEY FEEL WE SHOULD FEEL. AND SO WHEN WE ARE FACED WITH AN ISSUE LIKE THIS. IT IS A SMALL ISSUE IN MANY WAYS BUT COULD HAVE PROFOUND IMPACT. IN A COMMUNITY. IF WE PREVENT ONE INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING. WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO BECOME THE NORM. I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE THE NORM IN MY CHILDREN'S LIVES AND MY GRANDCHILDREN'S LIVES WHAT WE HAVE TO ARM OUR SCHOOLS AND CREATE BARRIERS AT OUR SCHOOL AND MAKE THEM LIKE ARMED CAMPS WHERE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL. WE PRIDE OURSELVES AS BEING A CIVILIZED NATION. AND MOST OF US CAN REFLECT BACK UPON WHEN WE WERE IN SCHOOL THAT IS A SAFE PLACE. THOSE THINGS ARE THE SAFE PLACES WE GO. AND SO WHETHER YOU VOTE FOR THIS AND I HOPE YOU WILL. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER ONLY. THIS IS ONE OF THE EFFORTS TO BEGIN TO WRESTLE WITH THIS VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM THAT WE FACE. AND WE CANNOT KEEP WAITING FOR THE PERFECT. THING TO HAPPEN IN THEIR FULL VOICE THE GOOD THAT IS THERE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS AND A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS IN A LOT OF LEGISLATION. ADDED MAY INCONVENIENCE SOME OF US IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT IN OUR LIVES. BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR THE GREATER GOOD. AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE AS I THINK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAVING. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID WHEN THE ELEPHANTS FIGHT. THE BIG WARRIORS THE DEMOCRATS THE REPUBLICANS THE PRO NRA THE ANTI IN OUR A THAT THIS THAT THAT AND WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND OUR CHILDREN ARE BENEATH THE ELEPHANTS AS WE STOP AT EACH OTHER. AND THERE AND WE ARE LOSING THEM EVERY DAY. I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE VOTING ON. I'M VOTING FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE ANSWER. BUT IS ONE OF THE PIECES IN THE PUZZLE. THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. AND IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR. I HOPE YOU COME BACK TO WORK TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. BECAUSE AS A NATION WE CANNOT TOLERATE A SHOOTING IN OUR SCHOOLS AE SOME GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS. EVERY WEEK. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME AND IT SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT. ALL DEBATE AND DISCUSSION HAVING CEASED MISTER TING YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER FIRST LET ME JUST THINK. ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES I YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD. MANY PIECES OF LEGISLATION. REGARDING GUNS AND FIREARMS AND I WOULD SAY I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR AN INCREDIBLY HOT RESPECTFUL DISCUSSION I THINK THAT THAT. TO ME IS A SIGN OF PROGRESS AT TIMES. WHERE? WE ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ANSWER IS AND AGAIN THIS BILL ISN'T. THE ONLY ANSWER. BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID IT'S A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. AND WHAT WE ALL NEED TO DO IS TRY OUR BEST I KNOW WE ARE WORKING HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY. FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES. PUZZLE. TO MAKE. STREETS SAFER TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS SAFER TO MAKE OUR. WORKPLACES SAFER. THIS STRUCK ME THE MOST WHEN. I WAS TALKING TO MY DAUGHTER WAS IN FIFTH GRADE. AND. PROBABLY LIKE MANY PARENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH WERE BUSY WE DON'T GET THAT MUCH TIME TO TALK TO MY KIDS SO. I GET TO TALK TO MY DAUGHTER PRIMARILY WHEN A DRIVER TO SCHOOL. A WE GOT AN EMAIL AFTER THE PARK WHEN SHOOTING FROM OUR FIFTH GRADE TEACHER. WHO SAYS DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT? THIS SUBJECT BUT DIDN'T REALLY KNOW. WHAT ELSE? COULD DO OR HE FELT IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE TO NOT TO. SO HE. WHEN AND TALKED TO MY DAUGHTERS FIFTH GRADE CLASS. RIGHT THIS IS A FIFTH GRADE CLASS. ABOUT WHAT. THEY MAY HAVE TO DO. IF THERE WAS A SHOULD. IF THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. ON SCHOOL. THAT SHOULD SOME THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT NO. GREATER. NO TWELFTH GRADER. NO KINDERGARTNERS. SHOULD EVER HAVE TO HEAR FROM THEIR TEETH. WE BUT HE WAS DOING IT TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND TO NOT HAVE A POLITICAL DISCUSSION BUT FRANKLY WHAT TO DO. PROTECT YOURSELF. SO I I AM VERY OWN. RESPECTFUL ABOUT FOLKS HAVE DIFFERENCES HAVE CONCERNS. I HAVE PLAYED TO STAND BIRD JUST TO ECHO MY COLLECTION SAN DIEGO'S. PROMISED AND THEN COME BACK WITH. WHAT THE OTHER POLICY ALTERNATIVES ARE? LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT ELSE WE SHOULD BE DOING. BECAUSE THIS IS JUST. THE BILL I'M PRESENTING DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE AREN'T TWENTY THIRTY FORTY DIFFERENT BILLS OUT THERE THAT WE SHOULD BE. THINKING ABOUT. AND REALLY WORKING I KNOW ONE OF THE INITIAL CONCERNS WITH THIS TO BE OVER USE. THAT THIS TYPE OF RESTRAINING ORDER THEY'RE JUST BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF RESTRAINING ORDER SO UP TO NOW. IT'S BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE'S BEEN LITTLE BIT OVER A BELIEVE TWO HUNDRED RESTRAINING ORDERS AT FINISH. TWO HUNDRED. SO WE SEE THAT IT'S IN ITS IN ITS GROWING BECAUSE NOW LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTUALLY SEEING THIS AS A POTENTIALLY EFFECTIVE TOOL. FOR THEM TO GET HANDS OUT OF THE DANGERS PEOPLE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT AGAIN. THE REASON THAT WE ADDED COWORKERS ADDED SCHOOL OFFICIALS. I HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. PEOPLE WHO ARE TEACHERS OUR PRINCIPALS. PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SCHOOLS SPEND MORE TIME WITH OUR KIDS AND WE GET TO. THEY ACTUALLY SEES SEE WHAT HAPPENS. CO WORKERS. CO WORKERS I SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU THAT I DO WITH MY DAUGHTER. YOU ALL SEE MORE OF WHAT. WE ALL SEE EACH OTHER A LOT MORE THAN WE SEE OUR FIRM. SO AGAIN IF THERE ANY RED FLAGS THEY CAME UP. WE WOULD PROBABLY BE THE ONES TO ACTUALLY SEE SOME OF THE SIGNS SOME OF THE SIGNALS. AND HOPEFULLY WE WOULD ACT. SO AGAIN TODAY. I'M ASKING FOR A LITTLE BIT ACTION FROM OUR LEGISLATURE. TO SHOW THAT NOT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE THE ANSWER. BUT THAT THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE FOR TRYING TO MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER IN CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY OSCAR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT UPDATES EXISTING K. TWELVE EMPLOYEE DISMISSAL POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. TO BETTER PROTECT STUDENTS FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE UPDATED THE PROCESS FOR DISMISSALS OF PERMANENT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO FIFTEEN. THAT MAIL PROVIDED THE FRAMEWORK NEEDED TO PROTECT STUDENTS FROM SERIOUS FORMS OF MISCONDUCT BY GIVING LOCAL SCHOOL OFFICIALS A MECHANISM TO ASSURE AN OFFENDING EMPLOYEES PROMPT REMOVAL FROM THE CLASSROOM. BUT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO FIFTEEN SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND GOVERNING BOARDS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS MISCONDUCT INVOLVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND OTHER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR WITH STUDENTS AS A RESULT THERE SOME SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THAT ARE STAYING IN THE CLASSROOM EVEN AFTER NUMEROUS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. TODAY'S BILL ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE AND FURTHERS THE PURPOSE OF AB TWO FIFTEEN. WELL EXISTING LAW ONLY ALLOWS EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY THE DATES BACK FOUR YEARS EXCEPT IN THE MOST SERIOUS INSTANCES OF ALLEGED. SEXUAL ASSAULT OR CHILD ABUSE DURING A DISMISSAL HEARING THIS BELT WOULD ALSO A LOT OF IT ENDS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR OTHER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR EVEN IF IT IS OLDER THAN FOUR YEARS. I IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT TODAY'S BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN MEETING TWO PRESSING SOCIAL CHALLENGES MAKING OUR SCHOOL SAFER AND ROOTING OUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

THE INTERNET REMAINS OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY AUTHORIZES MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT AND PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICTS TO OPERATE THEIR OWN BROADBAND NETWORKS. BUT OTHER FORMS OF INDEPENDENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE LIMITED AUTHORITY TO DO SO. FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS CAN'T INITIALLY PROVIDE THE SERVICE BUT HAVE TO SEE IT OVER THE AUTHORITY ONCE A PRIVATE ENTITY IS WILLING TO DEPLOY THE SERVICE. RESTRICTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM BUILDING OUT THEIR OWN HIGH SPEED NETWORKS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO CLOSING CALIFORNIA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS WERE ONLY FORTY THREE PERCENT. OF THE POPULATION HAS ACCESS TO BROADBAND IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS OR IN AREAS THAT ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO ONE PROVIDER. OR WORD THERE IS A LACK OF ONGOING INVESTMENT. RECENTLY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION FCC TOOK ACTION TO REPEAL NET NEUTRALITY RUSE.

FILE ITEM NUMBER FORTY NINE. ACR TO THIRTY TWO BY MS BAKER THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TO THIRTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BAKER RELATIVE TO FOOD ALLERGY AWARENESS WEEK. IS BAKER YOU MAILED ME THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY ACR TO THIRTY TWO WHICH COMMEMORATES THE WEEK OF MAY THIRTEENTH REMAIN NINETEENTH. AS FOOD ALLERGY AWARENESS WEEK. AS MANY AS FIFTEEN MILLION AMERICANS HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES AND NEARLY SIX MILLION OF THOSE. WHO HAVE THEM OUR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN? INCLUDING MY SON FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF HIS LIFE WAS I HAD LIFE THREATENING ALLERGY TO A TREE NUTS AND PEANUTS. EAT FOODS BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF FOOD ALLERGY REACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES SHELLFISH FISH EGGS MILK TREE NUTS PEANUTS SOY AND WHEAT. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SEEN ON THE RISE INCREASINGLY PARTICULARLY AMONG THE LAST DECADE AND PARTICULARLY AMONG CHILDREN. THEY RESULTS IN OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM DEPARTMENT VISITS EACH YEAR. AND THE NUMBER OF FOOD ALLERGY REACTIONS REQUIRING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS OR EMERGENCY TRIPS ROSE SHARPLY JUST IN THE PAST TEN YEARS BY ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT WE DON'T KNOW. EXACTLY WHY IT IS A BIG QUESTION AND SCIENCE IS LOOKING INTO IT. BUT THIS RESOLUTION IS IMPORTANT TO INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT THINGS WE SHOULD KNOW. FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT THE PARENTS FAULT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THE MOM DID WRONG DURING A ANYTIME OF THE CHILD'S EARLY LIFE OR WHEN THE CHILD WAS IN UTERO. IT'S ALSO NOT THE CHILD'S FAULT. THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG EITHER. AND IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING WHERE FOOD ALLERGY ALLOWS YOU ONCE YOU PUT THE ALLERGEN ON THE FOOD TO TAKE IT OFF OR BRUSH IT OFF FOR JUST SCRAPED AWAY BECAUSE THESE ARE LIFE. THREATENING. ELEMENTS. AND EVEN THE BEARER AMOUNT OF CONTACT COULD CAUSE SOMEONE TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. ANOTHER POINTS OUT JUST A FACT ABOUT FOOD ALLERGIES IS SAM HAPPY PANTS AND THOSE EMERGENCY TOOLS THAT WE ALL SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS THE STATE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE AND HAVE. THEY'RE NOT AN ASSURANCE THAT IT'S OKAY TO HAVE THAT FOOD ALLERGEN IN THE AREA FOR THE PERSON WHO'S ALLERGIC THEY BUY YOU TIME AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WORK. AND THERE ARE STILL FATAL INCIDENCES THAT HAPPENED EVEN AFTER THE USE OF ABBY PENS AND BENADRYL AND EMERGENCY INTERVENTION. THERE'S NO CURE FOR FOOD ALLERGIES BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO RESEARCH AND WE SHOULD BECAUSE IT AFFECTS EVERYONE OF OUR ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS. THE FOOD ALLERGY RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ORGANIZATION IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS WITH FOOD ALLERGIES AND PROVIDE THEM WITH HOPE FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO LIVE FULLY IN OUR AREAS. AGAIN INCREASINGLY A AWARENESS ABOUT THIS IF YOU FIND TO COME ACROSS SOMEONE WHO HAS A FOOD ALLERGY. PARTICULARLY CHILDREN IT TOTALLY CHANGES THEIR LIFE THEY CAN'T GO TO SUMMER CAMP THE SAME WAY THAT EVERYONE ELSE CAN THEY CAN'T GO TO BIRTHDAY PARTIES THE SAME WAY SOMEONE ELSE CAN SLUMBER PARTIES ARE OVER TO SOMEONE'S HOME. I'M THE PARENT IS ALWAYS THINKING WHAT CAN I BE DOING IN PROVIDING TO PROTECT MY CHILD. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE AND YOU COME ACROSS SOMEONE IN THAT SITUATION ASK THEM HOW YOU CAN HELP. ASK THEM HOW YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE LESS SUBJECT TO A LIFE THREATENING CONTACT WITH THAT. BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF HOW WE INCREASE AWARENESS AND WE PROTECT THOSE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES AND TELL WERE ABLE TO FULLY TO TREAT THEM AND HEAR THEM.
