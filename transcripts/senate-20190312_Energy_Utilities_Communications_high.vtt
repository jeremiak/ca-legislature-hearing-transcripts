CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.110
SIXTEEN PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC.

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:27.446
SUPPLIED 33% OF ITS CUSTOMERS

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.382
WITH FILE ELECTRICITY FROM

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:30.750
RENEWABLE SOURCES.

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.552
IN TWENTY TWENTY THEY EXPECT TO

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:35.755
BE AT ABOUT 56% OF THEIR

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.657
ELECTRICITY COMING FROM THOSE

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:38.891
CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.694
A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IN

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:42.829
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS A 28%

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:45.164
BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY EXPECT TO

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.465
BE AT 40%.

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:49.802
SENIOR GAS ELECTRIC IN TWO

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:51.637
THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS AT 43% AND

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:53.806
AND TWENTY TWENTY EXPECTS TO BE

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.142
A FORTY FIVE POINT 2%.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.177
THIS IS ALL FAR IN ADVANCE OF

00:07:58.244 --> 00:07:59.745
THE EARLIER LEGISLATIVE

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.747
DIRECTION THAT THEY WOULD BE AT

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.851
33% BY --

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.018
TWENTY TWENTY THE THE RENEWABLE

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:08.588
PORTFOLIO CONTRACT THE PRICES

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.657
FELL NINE POINT FOR PER YEAR

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:15.761
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.296
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE TWO

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:19.232
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AVERAGE PRICE

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.333
ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO IN

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.869
CALIFORNIA WAS FOUR POINT SEVEN

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:24.737
CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.973
SOME UNVERIFIED REPORTS THERE

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.709
WE'VE HEARD IN THE SOUTHWEST OF

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:30.977
TO CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:33.679
DESERT SOLAR IN FOR SENT --

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:35.081
ON A PER KILOWATT HOUR SOLAR

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:36.949
PLUS BATTERY KEEP GETTING

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.719
REPEATED SO THIS THE LEGISLATURE

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:41.487
THE CITY CALIFORNIA STRATEGY.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.656
OF FORCING THE PROCUREMENT OF

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.892
OUR ENERGY OUR ELECTRICAL ENERGY

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.426
FROM THESE CLEAN SOURCES.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:49.829
HAS PROVEN TO BE A GOOD BATH

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.831
BOTH IN TERMS OF SUCCESS IN

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:53.532
ACTUALLY BUILDING THE PROJECTS

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.134
AND AND CONNECTING THEM AND

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.803
PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH RELIABLE

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.337
ELECTRICITY.

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:00.673
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF BRINGING

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.375
THE PRICE DOWN BY CREATING A

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:03.309
LARGER MARKET AND MORE

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.445
COMPETITION --

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:10.249
SO THAT'S IN OR IN OUR OCTOBER

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:10.816
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ANNUAL

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.351
REPORT ON THE RENEWABLE

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:13.619
PORTFOLIO STANDARD.

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.588
I'LL JUST MENTION A FEW OTHER

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:16.222
THINGS --

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:18.457
MAJOR FOCUS INTERNALLY WE HAVE A

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:20.660
NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHO HAS

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:23.429
UNDERTAKEN A WHOLE SERIES OF

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.264
INTERNAL RESTRUCTURING.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.899
WE HAVE MUCH STRONGER BUSINESS

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:28.501
SYSTEMS ALREADY AS A RESULT OF

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:29.769
OUR EFFORTS --

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.237
WERE BEGINNING TO WORK WITH CAL

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:32.905
LIKE TEA AND OUR NEW I. T.

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:36.242
DIRECTOR TO MOVE INTO THE TO THE

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.077
EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY SOME DAY

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:39.111
WE HOPE TO CATCH UP TO

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.547
TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TODAY.

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.282
WE HAVE NEW INTERNAL AND

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:44.583
EXTERNAL AUDITORS WE HAD A

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.918
RETIREMENT AND WE ACTUALLY

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.887
REPLACED ONE WE WANT TO GET

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:49.655
STRONGER IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.223
TO ACTUALLY DO THAT BUT WE'RE

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.992
TRACKING BETTER CANDIDATES NOW

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.460
THAN WE DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO%

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.095
WHEN WE ACTUALLY FIRST MADE THE

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:58.597
EFFORT TO BUILD.

00:09:58.664 --> 00:09:59.465
UP THOSE PROGRAMS.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.700
PROGRESS IN RESOLVING OUR

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.868
PROCEEDINGS WITHIN TIME LINES.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:04.804
SO TWO HUNDRED NINE PROCEEDINGS

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.839
LAST YEAR WERE RESOLVED IN A

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:09.308
TIMELY FASHION. THIRTY THREE

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.776
WERE RESOLVED WITH EXTENSION

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:12.211
ANYWHERE FROM TWO WEEKS TO SIX

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.347
MONTHS MOST OF THOSE WERE

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:16.215
ACTUALLY TO ACCOMMODATE SETTLING

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.283
PARTIES.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.384
AS PEOPLE GOT CLOSE TO THE

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.453
DEADLINES THEY ACTUALLY STARTED

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.555
TO MEET TO DEVELOP SETTLEMENTS.

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.656
SO THEN WE HAVE TO REVIEW THE

00:10:23.723 --> 00:10:26.726
SETTLEMENTS TO WITH CALIFORNIA

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.127
LAW AND THAT DURING THE RATE

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:29.362
PAYERS INTEREST.

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:30.796
SO NATURALLY TENSE TAKE A BIT

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:34.233
LONGER. ZERO OF THE THE

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.835
PROCEEDINGS THAT WE THAT WE

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.436
EXPECTED TO COMPLETE LAST YEAR

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:40.006
RESERVE LATE WE HAVE ANOTHER TWO

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:41.907
HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.809
PROCEEDINGS UNDER WAY.

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:45.878
OF THAT ARE WITHIN TIME LINES.

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:48.047
I'LL SAY THAT THERE'S ONE SET OF

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.782
EXCEPTIONS WHICH IS THE THE

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:51.751
GENERAL RATE CASES PARTICULARLY

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:54.220
FOR THE LARGE ENERGY UTILITIES.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:56.589
THERE BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:58.624
REQUIREMENTS AND THE CHALLENGES

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.327
PARTICULARLY OF THE THE SAFETY

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.995
RATE MAKING SECTIONS THAT THERE

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:05.498
WERE ALL LEARNING HOW TO IMPROVE.

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.166
THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROPOSALS THAT

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.435
HAVE COME FORWARD FROM FROM SOME

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.170
OF THE PARTIES INCLUDING THE THE

00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:12.505
UTILITIES AND THE RIGHT PAIR

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:13.606
ADVOCATE.

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:16.242
THAT WE CONSIDER A FOUR YEAR --

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.177
CYCLE FOR GENERATE CASES RATHER

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:20.012
THAN THREE WE HAVE NOT MADE THAT

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.547
DECISION YET BUT I THINK THAT

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:22.581
THERE'S A WIDESPREAD

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.617
UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY.

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:26.152
OF THE THINGS THAT WERE ASKING

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:27.920
THE UTILITIES TO PURCHASE ON

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:28.721
BEHALF OF THE STATE OF

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:29.889
CALIFORNIA.

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:31.490
ARE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.159
TRY TO DO THAT WITHIN THE THREE

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:35.561
YEAR CYCLE AND IT THAT BECOMES

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:37.263
SOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:38.931
FIND THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY.

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:42.401
WELL INTO THEIR NEXT CYCLE

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.203
HAVING RESOLVED WHAT THE

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.805
EXPENDITURE PLANS ARE GOING TO

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.673
BE AND WHAT THE WAY WE'RE GOING

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.408
TO CARVE IT UP BETWEEN DIFFERENT

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:50.709
CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS.

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:51.777
YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVEN'T

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:52.812
DECIDED IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TO

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:54.046
FOUR YEARS THERE'S NOT COMPLETE

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:55.448
AGREEMENT WE SHOULD DO THAT I'M

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:56.782
JUST SAYING THAT THERE'S SOME

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.751
THERE'S SOME MOMENTUM AMONG SOME

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:00.519
PARTIES THAT DIRECTION WE'RE

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:02.054
STILL STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:03.322
IF THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:04.790
ACTUALLY TRY TO DO WITHIN.

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:07.460
THE THREE YEAR CYCLE RATHER THAN

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:09.829
JUST LETTING IT DRAG ON CURRENT.

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.030
OF THE UTILITIES --

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:12.932
YOU'RE ON THE ON THE SECOND YEAR

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:13.933
OF THE RATE.

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:17.002
ADJUSTMENTS OF ONLY ONLY ON ONE

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.671
ONLY ON ONE BUT I THINK THAT YOU

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:20.606
KNOW WHERE YOU ARE ON ON ON

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:22.942
THOSE RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS WE

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:24.143
JUST STARTED IN.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.411
WE TEND TO WE DON'T TEND TO DO

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.213
THEM ALL AT ONCE SO WE CYCLE

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.214
THEM SO THERE WERE THERE WERE

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.949
ONLY PURSUING ONE OF THE MAJORS

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.351
ENTITY GIVE TIME WE KICK IT OFF.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.519
AND THEN IT WOULD THEN THE

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.654
OVERLAP SOME BUT IT ALLOWS US TO

00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:37.189
DO THAT I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:38.390
FOR THAT INFORMATION IN THE

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:39.024
REPORT BECAUSE I DON'T FIND IT

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:42.495
DO YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:43.562
FAR AS WHAT IS THE THE CURRENT

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:44.930
TIMELINE ON THOSE RATE CASES

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:45.898
WHERE YOU ARE.

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:47.133
I CAN WHICH MEANS ARE YOU READY

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:49.068
WE NOW WHERE ARE YOU YEAH I I

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.603
CAN SPEAK TO THE BIG THREE

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:53.105
ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS UTILITY

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:54.874
TO CAN'T SPEAK --

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.775
TO OTHER RATE CASES BUT FOR ON

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.077
P. JEANNIE THERE AT THE VERY

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:00.146
BEGINNING OF A GENERAL RATE CASE

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.748
CYCLE THEY FILED THEIR GENERATE

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:06.218
CASE PLAN IN DECEMBER --

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:07.820
FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:11.357
EDISON WE ARE ON SUBSTANTIALLY

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:13.192
LATE WITH FINISHING THEIR

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:15.261
CURRENT RATE CASE CYCLE ON BATCH

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:17.897
YOU KNOW THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.832
ACTUAL CYCLE WAS --

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.368
WHERE WE 200-019-2000 --

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:23.869
EIGHT AND SO THAT'S PROBABLY

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:25.771
SEVERAL MONTHS AWAY FROM JANUARY

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:27.540
OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YES.

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:28.974
YEAH OKAY --

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.176
AND THEN --

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:33.379
WERE ALSO IN THE REVIEW PROCESS

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:35.748
OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC.

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.116
I SLASH --

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:40.252
SO CAL GASES GENERATE CASE ON IN

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.954
THEIR RATE CASE --

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:43.489
CYCLE --

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.824
WOULD HAVE STARTED ON JANUARY OF

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:47.493
THIS YEAR.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.728
OKAY ALSO IT WOULD HAVE STARTED

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:50.462
BUT HASN'T STARTED HAVING

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:51.997
STARTED SO THERE ON THAT WHAT

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:52.798
SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED WE

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:54.733
SHOULD MADE A FINAL DECISION BY

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.335
THAT TIME SO AND YOUR ARE YOU

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.169
AWARE OF A BILL THAT WAS

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:58.938
INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS THE TIMING

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.706
OF THESE RAPE CASES WITH.

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.474
SMALLER UTILITIES UP.

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:03.242
RELATED [inaudible]

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:06.011
TO PHONE SERVICE I'M I'M NOT

00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:07.146
YEAH OKAY ON THE DIED

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:10.216
UNFORTUNATE DON'T TRACK THE THE

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:12.318
SMALL TELCO GENERATE CASES.

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:14.086
AND SOWITH ONE OF THE

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:15.521
CHALLENGES OF POINT OUT THAT

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.156
WHAT EVERYBODY IS WRESTLING WITH

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:18.557
INCLUDING THE UTILITIES IS THE

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:20.492
IMPACT OF THE NEW FEDERAL TAX

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:22.828
CODES AND HOW TO ACTUALLY TRACK

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.263
THAT AND WHAT THE APPROPRIATE

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.198
WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS --

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:27.566
ON THAT BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:29.435
SOME OF THE MATERIALS FROM THAT

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:31.103
PROCEEDING IT'S NOT MINE SO.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.739
I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT WHAT

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:36.008
IN OTHER COMMISSIONERS DOING.

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.042
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:37.977
BEEN.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.578
DRESSING WITH IS THE AMOUNT OF

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:41.347
OVERLAP BETWEEN THINGS THAT WE

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:43.782
DO AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.684
SO USED TO BE THERE WE WERE JUST

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:47.720
RAY MAKING AGENCY FOR UTILITIES

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.855
AND WE SORT OF STOOD OFF TO THE

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:50.289
SIDE.

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:53.759
BUT I'LL JUST POINT TO THE

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.761
AMOUNT OF I HAVE MONEY THAT

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:59.198
PASSES THROUGH THE CPUC --

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:00.933
FOR ENTERED THAT LITHIUM BATTERY

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.535
STORAGE OR FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:05.271
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.740
HAPPENS TO THOSE TECHNOLOGIES

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:09.074
THAT ARE FUNDED BY RATE PAYERS

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:12.578
AT THE END OF LIFE TO THE JUST

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:14.313
OVERSEAS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.615
BECOME A HAZARD TO COMMUNITIES

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:17.516
THERE.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.518
SO TO WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.654
RECYCLING MARKET SOON IN SOME

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.188
RESPECTS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.156
TOXIC EFFECTS OF THESE

00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:26.859
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE DON'T HAVE --

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:29.161
BIOCHEMISTS WE DON'T HAVE --

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.663
A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS.

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.931
SO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TO

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:33.999
THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:35.668
COHERENTLY IN TO DO A GOOD JOB

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.436
WE FORM ALLIANCES WITH OTHER

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.671
STATE AGENCIES.

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:40.072
SO FOR EXAMPLE WE USE FOR JUST

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.707
SIGNED A NEW I'M MEMORANDUM OF

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.375
UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL RECYCLES

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.443
AND DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.445
SUBSTANCES CONTROL AND RECYCLING

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.781
IN END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT OF

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:50.049
BATTERY STORAGE AND SOLAR.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.617
PHOTOVOLTAIC.

00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:52.685
PANELS.

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:53.619
WE JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.287
LET LITTERING THE CALIFORNIA

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.656
LANDSCAPE WERE POTENTIALLY NOT

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.425
BEING REUSED OF POSSIBLE --

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:00.959
AND IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:03.362
THAT OUR WORLD HAS CHANGED.

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:04.697
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:06.732
EXPERTISE THE SKILLS OR THE

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.267
PERSONALITY TERMINALLY?

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:09.802
ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:11.437
OUR SEVERAL YEARS OF WORK WITH

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:14.139
CAL FIRE TO DEVELOP NEW FUELS

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:16.208
MAP. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:18.911
ON THE OUR FIRE MAPS THERE THEN --

00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:22.715
COUPLE TO NEW STANDARD AND

00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:23.882
MANAGE WE NOW HAVE THE TOUGHEST

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.417
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT STANDARDS

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.186
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:28.954
AND AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:30.923
FORESTERS WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE

00:16:30.989 --> 00:16:33.525
WHO WHO REALLY KNOW HOW FIRES

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:35.961
BEHAVE WHERE THE FUELS ARE SO WE

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.996
HAD TO ROOM WORK VERY CLOSELY

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:39.531
WITH CAL FIRE TO DO THAT.

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.200
WITH THEIR FIRE SCIENTISTS IN

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.801
WITH THEIR FIRE ENGINEERS MANY

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:44.937
OF WHOM WORKED SEASONALLY ON THE

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:47.039
FIRE LINES AND SO THE TO THE

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:48.674
EVEN THE PACE OF WHAT OF THESE

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:51.210
RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE A CHALLENGE.

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:53.078
WE WORK WITH BOTH CAL FIRE AND

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:54.947
YES TO DEVELOP NEW BETTER

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:56.415
PATTERNS FOR THE D. ENERGY

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:58.450
STATION PROGRAMS THAT --

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.052
YOU'VE TACITUS WITHIN --

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:02.321
SB NINE A ONE WE'VE ACTUALLY

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:04.156
BEEN USING A CONTRACT WITH THE

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:06.392
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:08.260
OUR PERFORM SOME OF THE LAND USE

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:09.828
PERMITTING THAT WE DO AROUND

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:11.797
TRANSMISSION --

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.332
AND THEN WE HAVE A VERY A LONG

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.633
STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.635

RELIABILITY GAS RELIABILITY WE

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.944
IS WHERE WE START TO REALLY DIG

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.246
IN TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:29.314
HAPPENING AND GAS MARKETS IN

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.816
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH THE THE

D. COMMISSION ACCOUNTS.

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:10.956
AND THEN FOR EXAMPLE THE

ALL HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:13.318
THE UTILITY'S PARTICULARLY THE

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:14.753
ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND THE GAS

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.288
UTILITIES HAVE DONE A FAIRLY

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.991
GOOD JOB AT THIS POINT.

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:22.094
WE CAN MEASURE TEN POINT FIVE

WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE SEEN

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.937
INVESTMENT THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.238
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:34.540
EMPLOYMENT.

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:36.975

THIS ISN'T JUST JOBS ACTUALLY

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.618
BUILD THE CAPACITY OF THESE

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:50.889

AND TO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:57.763
REST OF THE ECONOMY SO I THINK

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:59.431
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM WE

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:01.099
PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO IT.

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:02.401

LOOK AT IT WE START TO SEE THAT

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.183
THERE PORTIONS OF THE STATE WHO

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.985
HAVE NOT HAD AS MUCH SUCCESS

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.720

THAT AS THERE ARE MANY --

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:31.763
QUESTIONS OF THE UTILITY

00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:41.139
EVEN THOUGH THE PROGRAM IS

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:42.374
GROWING.

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:45.744
IT'S MORE THE EXISTING --

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:49.147
YOU IN RIDING THE SUCCESS OF

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:50.983
THIS PROGRAM WE'RE STRUGGLING TO

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:52.384
FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING THESE

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.186
OTHER PARTIES INTO IT I KNOW

00:20:54.252 --> 00:20:55.654
THAT SENATOR BRADFORD HAS BEEN

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.389
LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AS WELL IN

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.925
THIS IS PROPOSING LEGISLATION.

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:02.160
SO FOR A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IT'S

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:04.096
ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.230
OF ACTUALLY BUILDING AND

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:07.199
PROSPERITY IN THE PARTS OF THE

00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:08.900
STATE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE WOULD

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:11.436
SEE THAT PROSPERITY.

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:12.537
AND I THINK WE'RE VERY PROUD OF

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.039
IT -- I WANT

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.541
TO JUST FOCUS ON THREE TRENDS

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:19.044
THAT WE'RE SEEING.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.245
AND I THINK THAT.

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:21.780
ARE YOU KNOW I'VE I LIVED IN A

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.882
FORM OF DENIAL CLIMATE AND I'LL

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.017
FOR NUMBER OF YEARS I THOUGHT IF

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.752
WE WERE JUST REDUCING CARBON

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:28.820
EMISSIONS THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.922
BE SUCCESSFUL IN AVOIDING THE

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:32.524
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.259
AND I THINK THE THAT IS VERY

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.328
CLEAR TO ME THAT WE'RE STARTING

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:38.864
TO SEE ROUTE THOROUGHLY UNTOWARD

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:39.831
WINDOW VANCE IN NORTHERN

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:41.466
CALIFORNIA.

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:42.868
AND THAT OUR STANDARDS.

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:45.203
DON'T REALLY MATCH THE NEW

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.506
CHALLENGES MRS IS IS PART OF THE

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.408
CHALLENGE OF HAVING TO A MORE

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.542
MODERN.

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.010
SAFETY PROGRAM THAN CURRENTLY

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:53.278
EXISTS.

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:55.380
WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS ALONG THAT

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:57.783
ROUTE SO FOR EXAMPLE RATHER THAN

00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:00.185
JUST HAVING COMPLIANCE WITH

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:03.288
STANDARDS WHICH FORMS A CEILING.

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:05.457
ON SAFETY WE REQUIRED UTILITIES

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:06.758
TO EXPLAIN HOW THEIR

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:10.362
EXPENDITURES TARGET MAJOR RISKS.

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:12.164
AND ACTUALLY REDUCE THEM THAT

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.499
ACTUALLY COULD INCREASE THE

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.101
LEVEL OF SAFETY OVERTIME.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:18.036
IT'S A WHICH IS A TOOL TO DRIVE

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:18.970
INNOVATION.

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:20.272
WE'RE STILL.

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:21.973
EARLY IN THE STAGE BUT WE THINK

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.141
THAT THAT'S A PATTERN FOR

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.443
SUCCESS.

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:27.612
WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO THING

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:29.715
AT THE C. P. U. C. AS A RATE

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:33.985
MAKING AGENCY WITH SAFETY AUDITS.

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:34.619
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:37.255
ENOUGH BUT A ROUGH CALCULATION

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.724
OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:39.991
ACTUALLY DO.

00:22:40.058 --> 00:22:41.993
AN ANNUAL INSPECTION OF ALL

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.628
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:44.996
FACILITIES.

00:22:45.063 --> 00:22:47.165
CAME UP WITH SOME PLACE AROUND

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:48.300
TEN THOUSAND NEW EMPLOYEES AT

00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:50.035
THE CPUC.

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:52.938
WE TAKE THAT DOWN TO A FIVE YEAR

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:55.173
CYCLE WHICH IS WHAT WE DO FOR

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.576
OUR PIPELINE SAFETY UNDER THE

00:22:57.642 --> 00:22:58.577
FEDERAL --

00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:00.212
PIPELINE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL

00:23:00.278 --> 00:23:01.913
SAFETY AGENCIES RULES.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.349
THEN IT WOULD STILL BE ABOUT

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:05.851
FIFTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT A

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.219
COST OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:08.520
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS.

00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:09.788
SO I CAN SPEAK MORE TO THE

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:11.356
CHALLENGES AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:12.924
THINKING ABOUT FOR A COUPLE OF

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:15.227
YEARS IN TERMS OF SAFETY BECAUSE

00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:15.494
THIS IS --

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.763
THIS IS A BECAUSE THERE IS NO

00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:21.733
STATEWIDE SAFETY AGENCY. ONE ONE

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.069
WE TEND TO USE NATIONAL BEST

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.804
PRACTICES HOW DO WE DEVELOP

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:28.874
STANDARDS THAT ADDRESS THE THIS.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.609
SPACE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WERE

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.677
LIVING WITH I HATE TO TAKE CARE

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:33.245
OF YOUR RHYTHM INTERRUPT YOU

00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:35.514
HERE BUT DO WE KNOW HOW MANY

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.315
EMPLOYEES OF THE UTILITIES WHOSE

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:38.717
PRINCIPAL JOB HISTORY.

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:41.319
THESE UTILITIES INTERNALLY.

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:44.890
AND HAVE IS THERE A WAY TO

00:23:44.956 --> 00:23:46.491
SOMEHOW TO A SHIFT.

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:48.059
OF THOSE POSITIONS OVER TO THE

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:54.299
CPC IF IF YOU SEE A IN OUR A

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:56.434
CHALLENGES SENATOR IT'S TAKEN US

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:57.869
TWO YEARS TO GET AN EXTRA

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.271
HUNDRED SPACES FOR POLICE HERE

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:01.540
IN SACRAMENTO I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:02.841
WE DO WITH TEN THOUSAND NO.

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:03.341
WORRIES.

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:05.210
BUT ARE THE THE THE EMPLOYEES

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:06.745
FOR THE UTILITIES.

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:08.146
FIRST OF ALL ARE THE THEIR

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:10.582
NUMBER TWO ARE THEY PERFORM SO

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:12.050
THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:14.052
LOOKING AT SEPARATELY AND SO

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:17.122
WE'VE DONE A A SAFETY AUDIT.

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:19.424
OCC CITY CULTURE ADDITIVE OF

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:21.026
FIVE P. JEANNIE AND I THINK THAT --

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:22.994
YOU HAVE PASSED US IN --

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:25.664
IN SB NINE A ONE OF REPLICATING

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.133
THAT FOR THE OTHER LARGE ARE YOU

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.067
ENERGY UTILITIES.

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.503
SO WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.005
BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THE HAZARD

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:36.374
HIS CHNGED IN THE THE OVERALL

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:38.143
RISK IS INCREASED BECAUSE OF

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.644
CHANGING CONDITIONS.

00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:42.314
THE UTILITIES TEND.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.316
TO AT LEAST P. JEANNIE TEND TO

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:46.751
USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:48.486
AND THEN WHEN THE AUDITOR'S ONE

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:50.088
OUT TO TALK TO SOME OF THE LINE

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:51.122
CREWS.

00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:54.359
WHO I DO HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN --

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:56.661
THEY REPORTED AS MANY AS

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:57.462
NINETEEN DIFFERENT SAFETY

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:59.264
PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAD TO COMPLY

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.198
WITH.

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:01.833
THAT BECOMES A CHALLENGE BECAUSE

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.336
IT'S SIMPLY VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:06.404
PEOPLE TO AND REMEMBER ALL OF

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:08.306
THIS THE PROCESS STEPS THAT THEY

00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:09.808
HAVE TO TAKE.

00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:11.610
AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:14.246
TO REMIND OURSELVES IS SAFETY IS

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:16.181
TO IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:17.582
IT'S WHAT YOU DO.

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:19.517
IT'S THE THINGS YOU DO OVER AND

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.052
OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO WHEN YOU

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.487
GO TO VISIT A NUCLEAR POWER

00:25:22.554 --> 00:25:23.855
PLANT.

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:26.091
WHERE A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS ARE

00:25:26.157 --> 00:25:28.260
ACTUALLY VOLUNTARY BEST

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:30.795
PRACTICES ABOVE AND BEYOND AND

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.197
ARE SEIZE STANDARDS?

00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:34.799
IT'S DEVELOPED THROUGH A UTILITY

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:36.234
PROGRAM CALLED IN PRO.

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:37.736
ANA INSTITUTE OF NUCLEAR POWER

00:25:37.802 --> 00:25:39.070
OPERATORS.

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:42.307
THEY CONSTANTLY HER TRADING

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:44.175
INFORMATION WHEN SOMETHING

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:47.078
HAPPENS THAT THEY DON'T FEEL IS

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:48.914
A PROPER WAY THERE THERE'S AN

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.415
OUTAGE.

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:52.117
THAT ISN'T GOOD FOR DUE TO A NEW

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.251
SOURCE.

00:25:53.318 --> 00:25:55.620
THEY ALL TALK ABOUT IT THEY ALL

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:57.122
THEY ALL TRY TO TAKE THAT

00:25:57.188 --> 00:25:59.157
LEARNING AND TO INCORPORATE THAT

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:01.459
INTO THEIR DAILY PRACTICES THE

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:02.827
TRAIN FOR IT.

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.129
AND THEY MEMORIALIZES SO THAT IT

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:05.864
BECOMES NOT JUST WHAT THEY THINK

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:08.233
BUT WHAT THEY DO THEY PAY A LOT

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:08.800
OF ATTENTION TO WHAT PEOPLE

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:10.068
THINK.

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:11.903
BUT IT GOES MUCH DEEPER THAN

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.072
THAT AND SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:15.573
THAT WE HAVE TO GET.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.575
TO I'VE BEEN A IN IN OUR FIRST

00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:19.110
AUDIT WHICH IS OF P. JEANNIE WE

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:21.947
FOUND THAT THE TOP LEADERSHIP

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:23.114
FRICKLEY WAS NOT.

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:25.016
AS FOCUSED AS WE THOUGHT THEY

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:27.052
NEEDED TO BE ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:28.019
DOING THROUGHOUT THE

00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:29.721
ORGANIZATION.

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:31.957
SO ON THE OTHER UTILITIES

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.858
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T YET CONDUCTED

00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:35.393
THOSE AUDITS I CAN'T SAY.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.262
I WILL SAYTHAT OVER AND OVER

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:39.197
AND OVER AGAIN WHEN AN EMERGENCY

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:40.999
COMES UP IT'S FREQUENTLY THE

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:43.134
LINE PERSONNEL WHO STEP UP USE

00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:44.636
THEIR INITIATIVE.

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:47.739
AND AND TAKE THE RIGHT ACTIONS

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:48.506
ISSUES.

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:50.475
IS THE SAN BRUNO DISASTER WHERE

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:53.211
IT WAS A YARD SUPERVISOR WHO WAS

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:54.479
DRIVING IN HIS CAR.

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:56.915
KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THE VALVE WAS

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.950
A NEED TO BE TURNED OFF WENT TO

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:00.585
THE YARD GOT HIS TOOLS WENT

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:01.987
THERE AND DID IT MANUALLY

00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:04.622
BECAUSE THE FOR ONE REASON OR

00:27:04.689 --> 00:27:07.225
ANOTHER THE OPERATIONS CENTER.

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.393
WAS NOT WORKING THEY HAD NO

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.461
COMMUNICATION WITH FIELD THEY

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:11.029
HAD NO VISIBILITY ON WHERE THE

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:13.098
PROBLEM WAS HE JUST KNEW THAT

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:14.265
THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:16.234
SO I THINK THAT THAT THE SCALE

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:17.936
OF WHAT UTILITIES TO THE THE

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:20.605
AGING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:22.607
ALSO CHANGING CONDITIONS IN

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:24.275
LARGE PARTS OF WHAT THEY DO THIS

00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:27.312
IS THIS IS ALL IN SOME RESPECTS.

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:28.747
UNCHARTED TERRITORY.

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:29.948
AND THEN COME BACK TO WHAT I

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:31.583
THINK WE NEED TO DO BUT I THINK

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:33.651
THAT THAT SEE A LONGER

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:35.353
CONVERSATION AS WELL.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.521
AND I THINK THAT IS A IT'S ALL

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:38.223
HAPPENING WITH IN THIS WORLD

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:39.991
WHERE THE NATURE OF THE ROLE OF

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:41.693
THE LEAST THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.894
IS CHANGING.

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:44.562
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO ALSO

00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:45.897
UNDERSTAND THAT AS THEY GO

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:49.234
THROUGH THAT IT'S GOING TO BE-HARDER FOR THEM TO SOMETIMES

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:49.801
THINK ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:51.236
THINGS.

00:27:51.302 --> 00:27:53.371
PARTICULARLY TO LEADERSHIP LEVEL

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:53.671
[inaudible]

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:55.240
SO.

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:56.241
THAT'S A SECOND TOPIC THAT I

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:57.208
KNOW THE YEARS CONSIDERING

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:58.643
HAVING HEARING LOOKING

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.478
SPECIFICALLY AT THIS QUESTION OF

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:02.714
HOW CUSTOMERS DEPARTING FOR BOTH

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:04.082
NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:05.717
THAT'S ONE AXIS OF HOW PEOPLE

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:07.285
CUSTOMERS CAN MAKE CHOICES TO

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.653
PROVIDE THE ROLLER TRICITY.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.756
BUT ALSO SOME FORD FOR DIFFERENT

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:12.323
BUSINESS MODELS THAT ARE OUT

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.659
THERE -- IN

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.628
I I ALSO SAY IS THAT THERE'S A

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:17.996
LOT OF INNOVATION AS HAVING A

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:19.531
DISCUSSION WITH THE CONSULTANT

00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:20.765
TO THE TO THE SENATE

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:23.168
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE.

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:23.768
ASKING.

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:25.770
WHY SHOULD WE BE PREPARING FOR A

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:27.972
FUTURE THAT IS AUTONOMOUS

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:29.874
ELECTRIC VEHICLES WERE THE

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:31.776
INFRASTRUCTURES COULD LIKELY TO

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:33.845
BE THE AND BASED ON CORPORATION

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:36.981
ARCHER CENTRAL RECHARGE CHARGING?

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.550
OR SHOULD WE BE FOCUSED ON

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.652
INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP OF ELECTRIC

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:42.087
VEHICLES IN WHICH CASE IT'S

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:44.589
GOING TO BE A WORK PLACER IN

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.691
PLACE OF RESIDENCE.

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:48.560
THE THE THE WHERE SPENDING MONEY

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:50.161
THROUGH THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.563
ARE SPENDING RATE PAYER DOLLARS

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:53.231
BASED ON AND DIRECTION THE THAT

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:56.401
THE LEGISLATURE GAVE US IN SB.

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:57.969
THREE FIFTY AND WE CAN SPEND A

00:28:58.036 --> 00:28:59.637
LOT OF MONEY.

00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:01.606
WAITING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:02.841
THESE INNOVATIONS ARE GONNA

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:04.909
BRING TO US IN TERMS OF THE WAY

00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:06.845
THE TRANSPORTATION IS GOING TO

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:08.613
BE PLAYED OUT IN THE FUTURE --

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.215
ICE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:29:10.281 --> 00:29:11.850
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:12.917
AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT A

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:15.186
TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WE DON'T

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.855
REALLY KNOW WHERE PEOPLE GO.

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.490
WE JUST KNOW THE WHO WHAT WHERE

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:19.858
YOU'VE ASKED US TO DO WHICH IS

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:21.593
TO PROVIDE PARTICULAR KINDS OF

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:23.495
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT IT

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:25.730
WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS YET.

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:27.932
AND SO --

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.434
TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:30.101
I'LL JUST SAY THAT --

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:33.371
THAT THERE OF DIFFERENT

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.073
CHALLENGES PEOPLE IN WHO DEPART

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.242
FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:39.577
FROM LAND LINE PHONES.

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:41.713
TOWARDS CELL PHONES TRYING TO

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:43.781
GIVE WARNINGS FOR EXAMPLE DURING

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:46.084
DISASTERS HAS BECOME PROBLEMATIC

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:48.153
WE HOPE TO HAVE A MEMO TO YOU

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:50.488
FAIRLY SOON THE THAT SYNTHESIZES

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:51.556
SOME OF THE DIFFERENT REPORTS

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.825
WE'VE SEEN FROM WILDFIRES AND

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:57.362
AND AND AND FLOOD DISASTERS.

00:29:57.428 --> 00:30:01.432
LESS THAN 50% OF THE FOLKS WHO

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:02.600
ON THE COUNTY.

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:05.036
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IN

00:30:05.103 --> 00:30:07.872
AND SONOMA TRACKED IN THEIR TEST

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:10.375
ACTUALLY GOT ANY OF THE WARNINGS

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:12.076
THAT THE COUNTY PUT OUT.

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:14.112
SO WE COULD REQUIRE THE

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:16.314
UTILITIES TO DO THIS BUT I GIVEN

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.349
THAT THE WAY THE YOU REACH

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:19.117
PEOPLE IS THROUGH THE

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.151
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:21.352
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.587
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING

00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:24.088
TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE NEED TO

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:24.822
HAVE DONE.

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:27.192
AND SO I AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:28.660
SAFETY A GROW INCREASINGLY

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:29.727
CONCERNED.

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:32.096
THAT THE CPC IS NOT AS PREPARED

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.431
AS WE SHOULD BE.

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.933
BUT I ALSO HAVE THIS FEELING

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.668
THAT THEIR BIG GAP BETWEEN STATE

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.937
AGENCIES BETWEEN INDUSTRIES AND

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:41.339
AND THERE'S NOT THAT CENTRAL

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:42.807
SAFETY --

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:44.676
ENTITY IN THE IN THE STATE OF

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:45.243
CALIFORNIA THEY CAN GIVE US

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.178
DIRECTION [inaudible]

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:49.948
SO ON I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:51.449
ELSE WANTS TO JUMP IN OTHERWISE

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:53.218
I WOULD JUST GO ON TO TALK A

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:54.586
LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:57.989
OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE A

00:30:58.056 --> 00:30:59.591
ONE WE HAVE A CHART HERE.

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:00.925
WHICH IS BEHIND ME SO I MAY BE

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:02.994
HARD FOR SOME OF YOU TO SEE BUT

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:03.494
I THINK WE ALSO GAVE YOU

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:05.196
HANDOUTS.

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:07.899
SO FROM YOU BE FINALIZED THE

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.300
LEGISLATION IN OCTOBER THE

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:10.535
GOVERNOR SIGNED IT BECAME

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:13.571
EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST AND WE

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:16.941
REALLY JUMPED IN --

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.109
TO TO TO OUR PLAY WE WANTED TO

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:20.378
REALLY KIND OF FOCUS ON GETTING

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:21.846
CORD PIECES DONE.

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:24.716
BEFORE THIS SUMMER'S FIRE SEASON.

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:27.485
SO WE IMMEDIATELY --

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.354
CREATED DAY PROCEEDING TO LOOK

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.089
AT THE STRESS TEST THE YOU

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:33.858
INCLUDED IN SB NINE A ONE WE

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:36.628
HAVE BEEN AUGMENTING THE PRE

00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:38.963
MANAGEMENT PLANS WE GOT THE

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.632
FIRST ROUND OF THE NEW.

00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:42.300
WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT PLANS WERE

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:44.769
YOU WE'VE JOINED WITH CAL FIRE

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.971
TO ACTUALLY REVIEW THOSE PLANS.

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:49.140
WE HOPE TO ADOPT THEM IN TIME

00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:50.742
FOR THE UTILITIES TO ACTUALLY

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:52.610
CONTINUE ACTING ON THEM FOR

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:55.113
THROUGH THE THE THE SUMMER.

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:58.016
WITH DAN VERY ENERGETIC IN TERMS

00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:59.083
OF WHAT.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.019
ADDITIONAL THINGS WE NEED TO DO

00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:03.688
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE THE THE

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:05.423
VICTIMS OF DISASTERS --

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.492
SO I'LL JUST KIND REFER YOU TO

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:09.460
THIS CHART WERE GRINDING THROUGH

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:11.696
ALL THESE THINGS IT'S IT'S A

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:12.997
BURDEN ON US.

00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:14.999
OUT OF OUR FORTY JUDGES SEVEN

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:16.734
THE NUMBER ASSIGNED FULL TIME TO

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:18.236
THESE PROCEEDINGS --

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:19.804
THAT MEANS THAT OTHER THINGS

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.606
PROBABLY WON'T GET DONE AT THE

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.041
PACE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:23.975
THEM DONE.

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:26.377
WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANALYSTS SO

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:28.579
FOR EXAMPLE ON LOOKING AT A WILD

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.148
FIRE MANAGEMENT PLAN WE CAN

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:32.483
CHECK THE BOXES. TO SAY THAT

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.886
THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU TOLD US

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:35.920
THE PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE.

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:37.322
BUT WE DON'T HAVE MEANINGFUL

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:39.924
EXPERTISE IN FIRES IN FIRE

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:41.959
MANAGEMENT TO REALLY SAY WHETHER

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.061
THIS IS GOING TO ACTUALLY

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:45.163
PROVIDE THE KIND OF SAFETY THAT

00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:46.597
WE ALL EXPECT TO SEE.

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:48.099
WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITH CAL

00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:49.734
FIRE WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.002
THEM FOR THEIR PERSONAL TO HELP

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:53.338
US EVALUATE THAT SO I THINK

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:54.339
WE'LL GET AMOUNT TIMELY.

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:57.408
BUT AGAIN I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:58.710
ONE OF THOSE ISSUES IN TERMS OF

00:32:58.776 --> 00:33:00.745
WHAT OUR SKILL SETS ARE WHAT THE

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:02.146
WHAT THE LAW HAS ASKED US TO DO

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:03.681
IN THE PAST.

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:04.916
IN THE NATURE OF THE CHANGING

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:07.719
WORLD THAT WERE IN SO HAPPY TO

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:11.155
ANSWER QUESTIONS.

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:12.323
I JUST.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.926
WANTED TO COME BACK TO THE ISSUE

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:17.462
OF THE TIMING OF THE RATE CASES

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:21.332
BECAUSE HERE WERE OF OF THE

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:23.468
UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE WORKING

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:26.304
HARD TO ADDRESS SAFETY ISSUES

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:28.373
RELATED TO THE WIRE WILD FRES

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:30.808
AND WORKING TO HARD DARK RED.

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.343
AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.712
COMES FROM.

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:36.280
THE THE A BUDGET BUDGETS A

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:39.350
KAMADO OF THE THE RATE CASES.

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:41.719
AND WHEN I HEAR FOR YEARS ON A

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:43.488
ON A CASE IT JUST STARTED IN

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:45.356
JANUARY --

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:46.991
IT SOUNDS LIKE [inaudible]

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:49.394
WE'RE NOT [inaudible]

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.863
IMMEDIATELY RESPOND.

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:53.931
BEING RESPONSIVE TO KIND OF THE

00:33:53.998 --> 00:33:55.166
THREAD AND HAND.

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:58.069
IS THERE A WAY TO AS WE GO

00:33:58.136 --> 00:33:59.971
THROUGH THIS PROCESS SEEK TO

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:01.672
ADDRESS KIND OF THE THREAT TO

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:06.711
THE RATE CASE ALLOW SOME KIND OF

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:08.946
DECISIONS TO BE MADE.

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:10.648
EITHER X. YOU KNOW.

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:11.916
SHORTEN.

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:13.951
THE DECISION PROCESS AND I KNOW

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:15.386
THAT.

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:17.455
IS IT SEEMS EASY FOR ME SET UP

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:19.090
HERE JUST KIND OF WELL TO A

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:20.958
AGAIN OUT ALL OFFERS I HAVE IN

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:22.059
THE PAST IF YOU WANT TO GET

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:23.394
THESE THINGS OUT FASTER MAKE A

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:25.530
SINGLE DECISION MAKER WILL SPEED

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:26.197
RIGHT THROUGH IT.

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:28.199
BUT THERE'S THIS TENSION BETWEEN

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:30.334
DEMOCRACY YEAH AND THE INTEREST

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.736
IN ACTUALLY HAVING A LOT OF

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:34.172
PEOPLE BE ABLE TO SATISFY THEM

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:36.073
FOR THEMSELVES THAT THESE OR ARE

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.442
WISE EXPENDITURES.

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:40.077
VERSUS SPEED WHAT WE DO DO IS WE

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:41.612
ALLOW THE UTILITIES TO MAKE

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.182
THOSE EXPENDITURES AND RECORD

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:45.383
THEM IN SPECIAL ACCOUNTING.

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.318
OF POOLS WHICH WE CALL YOU THE

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:49.353
CATASTROPHIC REALLY YOU CAN MAKE

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.055
DECISIONS AND WE ON ROOM THAT

00:34:51.122 --> 00:34:52.156
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND AS A

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:53.357
MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE AS THEY

00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:54.625
COME FORWARD TO US AND SAY WE

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:56.160
THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN SPENDING

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:57.428
MONEY NOW.

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:02.066

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.608
QUEST THEM DOES COME BACK WITH

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.543
SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T CUT

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.045
CORNERS ANYMORE.

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:16.180
YOUR VIEW OF WHAT YOU TOLD US IN

00:35:16.247 --> 00:35:17.215
MANY WAYS WE NEED TO BE

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:19.150
TRANSPARENT THIS IS HOW WE MAKE

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:20.852
THAT TRANSPARENT.

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:24.622
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS --

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:26.591
IN OTHER WORDS HOW DO WE ON THE

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:28.226
MY QUESTION IS JUST WHAT STARTS

00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:29.594
UP PROCESS.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.928
USUALLY THEY TELL US THAT

THEY'RE READY TO START SPENDING

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.232
THROUGH APPLICATION OF I'LL JUST

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.433
PASS IT OFF DEAD SINCE HE

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.834
ACTUALLY HANDLES THAT WARRANT A

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.603
MINISTERIAL LEVEL WE DO TAKE A

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:39.437
VOTE ON IT.

00:35:39.504 --> 00:35:40.938
AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'VE TOLD US TO

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:43.274
BE TRANSPARENT AND THAT'S AND

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:44.175
ALL THAT IS FINE.

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:44.675
I'M.

00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:46.410
YEAH NOT TO GET TOO IN THE

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:48.279
TECHNICAL TERMS OF A GENERAL

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:50.181
RATE CASES BUT YET IF THE%

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:52.250
UTILITY WANTS TO DO I'D I'D

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.252
SPENDING --

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:55.720
BETWEEN RATE CASES SO IT'S

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.054
SPENDING A PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT

00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:59.690
APPROVED IN THE LAST RATE CASE --

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:01.092
WHAT THEY CAN DO IS I CAN COME

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.660
IN AND REQUEST OPEN WHAT'S

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:04.028
CALLED A MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT?

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.830
INTO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE SAFETY

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:07.398
RELATED SPENDING TO THE WILD

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:08.299
FIRES.

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:11.769
I SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON --

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:14.205
OF MAIL FROM LAST YEAR ACTUALLY

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.573
SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION AND

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.707
SAID WE WANT --

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:22.046
WE HAVE A PLAN TO DO FOR OF

00:36:22.113 --> 00:36:24.649
THEIR LINE SO THAT THEIR MORE

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:25.816
FIRE RESISTANT.

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.018
ON IN AS PART OF THAT IF WE

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:28.586
APPROVE THAT PLAN AND THEY WOULD

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.421
ALSO BE AUTHORIZED TO GO AHEAD

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:31.923
AND COLLECT THE MONEY AND RATES

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.424
FOR THAT --

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:34.792
WITH THE WILD FOR MITIGATION

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:37.194
PLANS THE STATUTE ACTUALLY SAYS

00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:38.930
THE A WIN YOU APPROVE YOU SEE

00:36:38.996 --> 00:36:40.498
WHEN YOU APPROVED THE PLANS.

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.199
ALSO APPROVED A MEMORANDUM

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.101
ACCOUNT THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:46.003
START COLLECTING --

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:46.804
ARE ACTUALLY NOT CASE ALLOW THEM

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.473
TO START BY TRACKING THE COST --

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.042
AND THEN IN THE NEXT GENERATE

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:53.110
CASE OR IN ANOTHER PROCEEDING

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:54.545
DEPENDING UPON TIMING IN ISSUES

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:56.547
WE WOULD GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:58.015
REASONABLENESS OF THE COST --

00:36:58.082 --> 00:36:59.817
SO IN THOSE CASES WHERE THEY

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.385
NEED TO SPEND ON SOMETHING

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.988
BETWEEN GENERATE CASES THERE'S A

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:05.389
MECHANISM OUT THERE FOR THEM TO

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:06.891
START TRACKING THE COST RIGHT

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:07.825
AWAY.

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.627
AND THEN WE WOULD DO --

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:11.162
A REVIEW OF THE REASON ON THIS

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:13.464
OF THE EXPENSES OF LATER ON IN

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:14.999
THE PROCESS OKAY.

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:15.766
I WILL GO TO SENATOR DODD

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.301
FOLLOWED BY SENATOR RUBIO AND

00:37:17.368 --> 00:37:19.737
THEN WE HAVE HILTON AND STERN

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:20.037
[inaudible]

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:20.538
OKAY -- IF

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:22.206
YOU.

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:25.176
OKAY TO PARK TO PART QUESTION --

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:26.911
ONE JUST EXPOUNDING ON THAT RATE

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:29.614
CASE -- WORD

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.148
OF PROCESS RIGHT NOW ON A RATE

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:35.319
CASE OR OR SOME RULE MAKING --

00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:40.591
FOR THE NINE OH ONE WE CALL

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:43.594
REPAIR REPAIR PROTECTION.

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:46.097
BONDS CRACKED.

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:47.198
IT I'M ASSUMING.

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.799
I'LL JUST AYE I'M ASSUMING THAT

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:50.501
PROBABLY SINCE THEY'RE A

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:51.535
BANKRUPTCY.

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:53.537
THAT THAT'S PROBABLY.

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.740
NOT A PRIORITY ANY LONGER OR IS

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:57.041
THAT SOMETHING THAT KNOWS

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.709
PROCEEDING NO I SPENT THE

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.211
WEEKEND READING PEOPLE'S REPLY

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.079
COMMENTS ON ON THAT SO IT'S

00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:03.981
UNDER WAY WE HOPE TO HAVE A

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.816
METHODOLOGY.

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.184
THE PEOPLE CAN SEE.

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:09.687
SET THE CHALLENGES THAT WE DON'T

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:11.255
KNOW WHAT THE COSTS ARE THE WITH

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.890
BOND.

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.158
FOR ALL YOU HAVE IS REALLY ROUGH

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:16.861
ESTIMATES USUALLY WHEN.

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:20.464
YOU DO A RECOVERY ACTION.

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:22.233
YOU COME FORWARD TO THE P. YOU

00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:23.901
IN C. AND SAID.

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.337
HERE'S WHAT WE HAD TO PAY OUT TO

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:28.472
SETTLE ALL THESE CLAIMS AGAINST

00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:31.242
THIS SOMETIMES THE UTILITY.

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:33.144
JUST HAS TO PAY CLAIM SIMPLY

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.046
BECAUSE THEIR EQUIPMENT.

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:36.480
BECAUSE THE PROBLEM.

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:40.217
THERE'S NOT A A A A THEY COLLECT

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:44.021
NECESSARILY FOR A A FAILURE TO

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:45.556
OBSERVE STANDARDS IT JUST

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:46.457
HAPPENED.

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:48.159
THAT'S INVERSE CONDEMNATION

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.794
THEY'RE THE FIRST PAY ARE THEY

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.362
CAN COLLECT FROM INSURANCE

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:52.496
COMPANIES THEIR INSURANCE

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:54.699
COMPANIES SOMETIMES OTHER

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:56.267
PARTIES WHO CONTRIBUTED.

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:59.637
EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE MALIBU FIRE

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:00.738
TWO YEARS AGO THEY WERE CAUSED

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:02.373
BY A TELEPHONE COMPANIES

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.475
EQUIPMENT ON THE POLLS. FOR A

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.477
SIMILAR CASE WERE CABLE COMPANY

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:09.547
AND SAN DIEGO DID THAT IN THE

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:10.514
TWO THOUSAND THREE FIRES SO

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:12.249
THEY'LL COLLECT ALL THAT MONEY.

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:14.051
THEY'LL THEY'LL USE THEIR OWN

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:15.853
INSURANCE POOL THEN I'LL COME

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.221
AND SAY HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:21.058
BETWEEN WHAT WE HAD TO PAY OUT.

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.527
AND WHAT IT COST FOR US TO TO

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:25.029
PAY ALL THESE CLAIMS.

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:27.364
WE PERFORM A REASONABLENESS TEST

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:30.067
YOU CHANGED THE RULES FOR US FOR

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:32.036
CLIMATE RELATED FIRES.

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:33.704
SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:36.040
THAT YOU ALSO HAVE ALLOWED THEM.

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:38.375
THEN TO SECURITIZED THE COST

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:39.977
RATHER THAN DUMPING IT ALL INTO

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:41.712
RATE PAYERS IN A SINGLE YEAR SEE

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:44.115
YOU SPREAD IT OUT OVER YOU OVER

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:44.982
SEVERAL YEARS.

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.617
IT MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:48.352
THEM TO SATISFY ALL THEIR OTHER

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:49.854
CREDITORS AT THE SAME TIME

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.622
BECAUSE NOT ALL THEIR CASH GETS

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:53.290
TIED UP IN THAT ONE TOOL WE'RE

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:54.458
TRYING TO DEVELOP THAT

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.861
METHODOLOGY IF YOU COME FORWARD

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:57.995
WITH THE CLAIM.

00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:00.564
HERE'S HOW WE WOULD EVALUATE

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:03.134
WHAT YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.302
VERSUS WHAT RATE PAYERS WILL BE

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:06.771
RESPONSIBLE.

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:09.273
FOR UNDER THE NEW TEST THAT THE

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.042
LEGISLATURE GAVE US IN SB NINE A

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.943
ONE REALLY IT'S TO QUESTION I

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.212
REALLY APPRECIATE THE SECOND --

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.447
PART OF THAT QUESTION AND I'LL

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:20.651
GET TO MY LAST ONE IS.

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:22.219
YOU INDICATED A ONE OF THE

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:24.555
MEETINGS THAT PERHAPS --

00:40:24.622 --> 00:40:26.857
THE CBC MAY HAVE THE ABILITY IN

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:28.325
THE FUTURE.

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:30.528
ON THAT GO TO HOLD TO BE ABLE TO

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.329
APPLY THAT --

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:33.597
ELSEWHERE.

00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:35.566
IN JUST READING BETWEEN THE

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:37.001
LINES WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:37.802
NOW.

00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:40.104
WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:42.072
NST GT.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.974
THAT MAY BE SOMETHING.

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:46.443
THAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE DO YOU

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.412
HAVE YOU DONE WORK WITH YOUR

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.114
ATTORNEYS OR ANY.

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.782
TO HAVE ANY FURTHER --

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:53.417
OPINION ON THAT WE'VE WE'VE

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:55.219
WE'VE DONE THAT I UNDERSTAND

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.687
THAT ARE THAT SOME OF OUR STAFF

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:57.788
IT HAD CONVERSATION WITH

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:59.590
LEGISLATIVE STAFF WHO BELIEVE

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:00.491
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:02.827
AUTHORITY THAT'S THE PAIN OF

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:04.228
SOME OF MY ATTORNEYS.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:07.431
SO OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE QUIT

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:08.699
SAYING THAT --

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:10.334
IF IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:12.002
LIKE FOR US TO APPLY THE SAME

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:14.839
TESS IN.

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:15.873
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEN I WAS

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.741
SO HOPE THE WILL GIVE US OF

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.076
PERMISSION TO DO THAT.

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:19.844
IS -- AT

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.079
THIS POINT IS VERY CLOUDY AND WE

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:23.447
KEEP GETTING MIX I KEEP GETTING

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:26.050
MIXED MESSAGES FROM A VARIETY OF

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:27.685
SOURCES [inaudible]

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.719
YEAH [inaudible]

THE IT DOES THE BILL DOES NOT

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:48.772

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:59.350
SECURITIZATION F OF COSTS TO

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:03.988
COMPONENT.

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:05.890
AND COLLECT COSTS THAT WE

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:07.491
AUTHORIZED EITHER BECAUSE THEY

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:08.826
WERE PRUDENT --

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:11.362
OR BECAUSE THEY WERE ABOUT S.

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:13.097
THRESHOLD ON THE STATUTORY

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:15.566
AUTHORITIES VERY EXPLICITLY FOR

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.534
WILDFIRES IN --

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:18.102
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHERE

00:42:18.168 --> 00:42:19.570
THERE'S SOME QUESTION ON WHERE

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:22.439
OUR AUTHORITY IS IS THAT ABILITY

00:42:22.506 --> 00:42:24.775
TO APPLY THE NEW.

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:26.143
NC STANDARDS THAT THE

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.847
LEGISLATURE APPROVED AND AND SB

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:32.483
NINE A ONE AS IT RELATES.

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:33.117
TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BECAUSE

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:33.617
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD SOME

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:36.453
FLEXIBILITY IN HOW WE DEFINE --

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.489
PRUDENCE HE THERE IS SOME

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.591
QUESTION IF WE GOT A PROCEEDING

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:43.427
TO LOOK AT THE FOR AND SEE OF IT

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:44.461
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE.

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:46.864
WHAT WITH THE STANDARDS WE USE

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:48.966
THEIR AND COULD WE USE --

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:50.935
THE STANDARDS IN THE BILL EVEN

00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:52.503
THOUGH THOSE STANDARDS --

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.371
WERE DRAFTED FOR TWO THOUSAND

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:56.006
AND NINETEEN AND BEYOND WHAT'S

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:57.374
YOUR OPINION ON THAT.

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.676
I THINK I WILL ON THE STICK WITH

00:42:58.742 --> 00:42:59.944
PRESENT PICKERS POINT THAT THERE

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.279
SEEMS TO BE SOME DIVIDED --

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:03.480
OPINION ON THAT --

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:06.583
I WILL SAY WE DO HAVE BROAD

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.653
AUTHORITY ON ON HOW WE DEFINE

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.255
FOR AGENCY AND WE COULD LOOK AT

00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:12.456
IT BROADER THAN WE HAVE IN THE

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:13.958
PAST.

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.359
YEAH MY SUGGESTION IS YOU MAY

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.593
NEED THAT BEFORE --

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.462
THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO BE

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:19.396
ABLE TO APPLY ON THAT BUT THAT

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:21.031
IS ONLY POSSIBLE BUT HERE'S MY

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:23.667
FEARS GIVEN THE CLOUDY ANSWERS

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.102
THAT WE RECEIVED ALL AROUND.

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:26.203
IT'S PRETTY LIKELY THAT THIS

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:30.574
WILL BE THE CPUC IN THE COURTS.

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.576
AND IF MARKETS ARE LOOKING FOR

00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:34.345
CERTAINTY.

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:35.779
THAT IS NOT GONNA SARACENIC GIVE

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:37.147
THEM WITH ME IF I COULD BUILD ON

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:38.082
THAT I MEAN THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:39.516
HEARING IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:42.019
RATING AGENCIES SAY RIGHT NOW.

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:44.188
ON IS THEY NEED MORE CERTAINTY

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:46.490
AROUND THE DECISION MAKING

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:47.958
PROCESS ON COST RECOVERY.

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:49.626
ON IN WE CAN'T PROVIDE THAT

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.061
CERTAINTY UNTIL THERE'S AN

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:52.997
ACTUAL APPLICATION PROCEED IN

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:54.365
FRONT OF US.

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.367
SO A QUICKER WAY TO PROVIDE MORE

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.601
CERTAINTY WOULD BE THROUGH THE

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.036
LEGISLATIVE FAIR ENOUGH I

00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:00.571
APPRECIATE STRAIGHT ANSWERS I

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:01.939
REALLY DO --

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:05.142
FINALLY MISTER CHAIR --

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:07.277
YOU INDICATED EARLIER THAT --

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.013
THE TO SEE IF YOU SEE DOES NOT

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:11.949
HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:14.451
YOUR VALIDATING ELISE RIGHT NOW

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:17.187
VALIDATING WHETHER --

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.555
I WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.858
MOUTH BUT IT WAS --

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:23.060
YOUR REGARDING SAFETY --

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:25.029
WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT ON THOUSANDS

00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:26.130
OF EMPLOYEES.

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:27.798
IN NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE NOT

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:30.000
GONNA DO THAT SOON ENOUGH.

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:32.403
YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO MAKE --

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:33.203
TO MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE A

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.005
DIFFERENCE I GUESS ONE OF THE

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:36.373
QUESTIONS I HAVE IS.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.075
RIGHT NOW WE GOT A SITUATION

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:40.210
WHERE PGE PRIVILEGE ISSUES P.

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:41.645
GENIE IS AN EXAMPLE.

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:42.179
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.714
DETERMINING WHAT WORK NEEDS TO

00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:45.349
BE DONE.

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:46.583
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DO THE

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.252
WORK.

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:49.520
AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

00:44:49.586 --> 00:44:51.088
CERTIFIED THAT THE WORK HAS BEEN

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:52.289
DONE.

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.624
AND THEY GIVE YOU THAT

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.025
INFORMATION AND YOU AUDIT.

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:58.529
THAT TO ME SOUNDS IT IN THE

00:44:58.595 --> 00:44:59.663
CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.697
BEING A MONDAY MORNING

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:03.167
QUARTERBACKS REALLY EASY.

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:03.767
AND NOBODY EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:06.136
THIS. THREE OR FOUR FIVE YEARS

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:07.704
AGO SO I TOTALLY GET THAT.

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.039
BUT THAT SOUNDS PRETTY CRAZY TO

00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:10.707
ME AND I GUESS WHAT I'M

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:12.843
WONDERING IS.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.244
WHAT ABOUT HAVING IT?

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:15.245
SAID YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:16.814
EXPERTISE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.249
CAL FIRE DOES WE HAVE A CONTRACT

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:20.517
WITH CAL FIRE HELP IS TO REVIEW

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:21.985
THE PLAN IS SO IF THEY'VE GOT

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:23.253
THE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING OUT

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.755
THERE AND AUDITING THEIR OWN

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:25.989
STUFF.

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:28.425
WHAT DID I THINK THE --

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:30.060
THE CHAIRMAN WAS GOV.

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:31.528
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHAT

00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:34.865
ABOUT TRANSFERRING THE THOSE --

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:36.100
**** MEETING --

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.000
LABOR [inaudible]

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:39.103
FROM.

00:45:39.169 --> 00:45:41.271
PGA IN THE COST OF THAT THE

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:44.274
CALIFORNIA HAVE A THIRD PARTY.

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:46.043
OVERSIGHT OF YOU KNOW THE

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.244
TRIMMING OF THESE TREES TO MAKE

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.413
SURE THEY'RE DONE SAFELY BECAUSE

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.948
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE.

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:52.616
TO GET THAT FROM.

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:54.351
THE POWERS THAT THAT THEY BE

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.519
GIVEN THE P. JEANNIE THAT WE CAN

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:57.354
COUNT.

00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.323
SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT THAT

00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:01.225
WOULDN'T BE A STEP FORWARD BUT

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.526
I'LL JUST SAY THAT IF YOU'RE

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:04.561
LOOKING AT THIS HOLISTICALLY I

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:05.662
THINK THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:07.831
OTHER PIECES THAT WE REALLY NEED

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:08.765
TO THINK ABOUT.

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:12.302
SO WE LEARNED THE HARD WAY.

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:13.737
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR THE STATE

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:15.372
OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE?

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:18.942
THE CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY LOOK

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:20.644
FOR PROBLEMS THAT ARE EMERGING.

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:23.480
AND TO BEGIN TO SAY OKAY.

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:24.148
WE NEED TO REALLY BEGIN TO

00:46:24.214 --> 00:46:26.617
ADDRESS THE WAY THINGS ARE

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:28.285
DIFFERENT.

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:30.954
OF WE ARE HAVING MORE.

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:33.524
PRECIPITATION FALL IS RAIN

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.892
RATHER THAN SNOW.

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.860
IN ALL OF THE STANDARDS FOR OUR

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:39.897
DAM SAFETY AND ARE DAM OPERATION --

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:42.466
BUILT AROUND. TWO HUNDRED YEARS

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:44.168
OF METEOROLOGY THAT ASSUME TO

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:46.236
HIRES THE SNOW PACK.

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:48.839
IN LESS WAS FREE REIGN WHAT DO

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.507
WE DO THEN TO DEVELOP NEW

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:53.177
STANDARDS WHEN WE HAVE STANDARDS

00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:54.878
WE TEND TO USE NATIONAL

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:56.713
STANDARDS SO FOR EXAMPLE OUR

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.483
PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS SAFETY

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.350
MATERIALS --

00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:01.318
PARTNERS AT THE FEDERAL

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:02.686
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY TAKE OUR

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.855
FOLKS TRAIN THEM AND WE USE

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:06.623
THEIR STANDARDS SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.225
WHEN A NEW HOUSE OR LIKE.

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.060
A GAS STORAGE FACILITY WHERE THE

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:12.196
PROBLEM IS WELLS WHICH WE DON'T

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:14.064
HAVE ANY AUTHORITY AND HE COMES

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:14.965
UP.

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:17.301
WE SORT OF DEPEND ON THEM AND

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:19.870
DOGGER TO DEVELOP NEW RULES THAT

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:21.505
WE ENFORCE FOR THE UTILITIES HOW

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.207
DO WE GET AHEAD OF THAT AND HOW

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.041
DO WE DEVELOP THOSE NEW

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.309
STANDARDS.

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:26.710
SO THOSE ARE TWO COMPONENTS.

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.779
THEN THE THIRD PIECE OF IT IS

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:29.913
HOW DO YOU POLICE.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.082
WERE IN AUDITING AGENCY BECAUSE

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.684
WERE RATE MAKING AGENCY.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.618
THOSE ARE THE TOOLS WHEN WE

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:35.986
STARTED WE HAD ENGINEERS AND

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.821
ACCOUNTANTS.

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.323
AND THAT'S BEEN THE TRADITION IF

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:40.724
YOU WANT IS TO HAVE THAT

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.192
POLICING POWER WHICH IS WHAT

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:43.293
YOU'RE DESCRIBING.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.428
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE WRONG

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:46.697
THING TO DO BUT I WILL ALSO I'LL

00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:48.565
JUST A LEAVE IT TO YOU IN YOUR

00:47:48.632 --> 00:47:50.400
EXAMINATION AS TO WHETHER IT

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.935
SHOULD BE IN THE CPUC.

00:47:52.002 --> 00:47:52.869
OR I TO BE IN SOME KIND OF A

00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:56.340
SAFETY THEN YOU NEED A REAL

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:58.108
ENFORCEMENT GRADUATED

00:47:58.175 --> 00:47:59.309
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM WE'RE

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:01.144
STRUGGLING TO DEVELOP THAT WE

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:03.647
HAVE INCOMPLETE CITATION AREA.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:05.115
AUTHORITY FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.717
UTILITIES WE HAVE IT FOR SOME

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:08.118
BUT NOT FOR OTHERS.

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:09.386
AND THEN.

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.954
THEN YOU START TO ACTUALLY HAVE

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:12.956
WHAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE'S

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:14.791
IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:16.026
SAFETY AGENCY ARE.

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.795
WHAT WE DO IS THE BACK UP THAT

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:22.232
RATE MAKING THAT WE DO WE GO OUT

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:23.166
TO ACTUALLY AUDIT?

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:24.668
BOOKS TO SEE IF THEY SPENT THE

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.136
MONEY THE WAY THEY SAID THE DEAL

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:27.871
WITH THE BOOKS WORK AND THEN WE

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:30.507
DO SPOT CHECKS. TO SEE WHETHER

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:31.808
THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FIELD.

00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:33.644
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:34.845
THAT'S WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.780
ASKED US TO DO.

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:37.347
IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:39.516
DIFFERENT GOD BLESS TELUS

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:39.816
[inaudible]

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:41.718
THE NEW.

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.186
THANK YOU --

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.087
THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:45.722
I'M AT TAKE A LITTLE BIT --

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:47.224
BACK.

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.358
IN THE SAME VEIN AS THOSE

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:49.926
QUESTIONS FOR YEARS YOU SAY YOU

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:51.395
HAD A FIRST AUDIT THAT FOUND

00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:52.963
THAT DOT THE LEADERSHIP WASN'T

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.698
DOING OR WASN'T FOCUSED ON WHAT

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.400
THE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON CAN

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:57.934
YOU EXPAND ON THAT AND GIVE US

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:59.369
SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU MEAN.

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:02.406
SO AFTER THE THE SAN BRUNO

00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:05.842
EXPLOSION --

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:07.144
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.979
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT HAPPENS SOME

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:10.647
OF THAT'S ON THE TECHNICAL LEVEL.

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:12.249
BUT WE ACTUALLY S. AN

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:14.251
INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL OF NOT

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:16.453
JUST LOOK AT P. JEANNIE BUT TO

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.388
LOOK AT THE CPSC. ONE OF THE

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.923
THINGS THAT THEY EMPHASIZE WAS

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.392
THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY CULTURE.

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.494
AND THAT'S KIND OF A HARD THING

00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:26.063
TO REALLY QUANTIFY IT'S A

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:29.199
QUALITATIVE SET OF BEHAVIORS.

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.702
SO WE HIRED A FIRM OUT OF NEW

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.670
YORK THAT HAS DONE A VARIETY OF

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:35.339
CORPORATE AUDITS INCLUDING

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:36.673
SAFETY AUDITS THEY'RE CALLED

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.942
NORTH STAR I GOT THEIR NAME FROM

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:42.646
THE THE COMMISSIONERS AND IN NEW

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:43.747
YORK OUR TREES OF WOMAN.

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:44.848
AND WE ASK THEM TO GO THROUGH

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:46.416
AND JUST DO A THOROUGH GOING

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.951
PROGRAM AUDIT.

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:48.618
OF THE SAFETY PROGRAMS AT P.

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:52.789
JEANNIE US BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:54.691
THEY ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT SAFETY

00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:56.093
ON A DAY TO DAY.

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.828
BASIS IF YOU'RE AN AUDIT AGENCY

00:49:57.894 --> 00:49:59.363
YOU'RE LOOKING AT EXPENDITURES

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:00.530
AND ACTUALLY THE SCOPE OF THE

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:01.565
PROGRAMS.

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:02.799
THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.034
PEOPLE DO.

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:06.136
DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW THE THEY DO

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.637
IT AND WE WANTED TO REALLY

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:08.905
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:09.940
THE GROUND.

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:11.675
SO WE CAN'T WE GOT WE GOT A

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:12.976
FAIRLY --

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:15.379
SIGNIFICANT REPORT ABOUT A YEAR

00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:17.013
AND EIGHT MONTHS AGO THAT THAT

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.281
BASICALLY SAID.

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.683
THAT THERE WERE A VARIETY OF

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.151
PROBLEMS AT EVERY LEVEL WITHIN

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:23.387
P. JEANNIE IN TERMS OF SAFETY

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:24.621
AND ONE OF THEM WAS THAT THE

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:27.324
BOARD OF DIRECTORS ITSELF WAS

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:29.126
NOT ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:31.428
AND NOT BEING PERSISTENT.

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:32.963
THEY HAD A SAFETY COMMITTEE.

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.398
IT WAS THE NUCLEAR AND AND

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.133
SAFETY COMMITTEE AND THEY

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:38.502
ACTUALLY DID TRACK THINGS.

00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:40.070
BUT THEY WEREN'T ASKING A LOT OF

00:50:40.137 --> 00:50:41.338
QUESTIONS NOR WAS THE REST OF

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:42.706
THE BOARD ASKING A LOT OF

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:44.641
QUESTIONS SO THAT'S A SIGN THE

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.676
DIRECTORS PROBLEM PARTICULARLY

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:48.178
AFTER THE SAN BRUNO [inaudible]

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:50.213
EXPLOSION.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.815
IN IN TO THIS DAY --

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:54.151
POINTED THIS OUT PUBLICLY FIVE

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.419
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR MEMBERS

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.354
OF P. JEANNIE ARE ACTUALLY ON

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:58.922
THE BOARD WERE ON THE BOARD AT

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:00.657
THE TIME SEEMED BURNER STILL

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:01.391
THERE.

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:02.626
THAT'S SINCE THIS MESSAGE WITHIN

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:04.728
THE ORGANIZATION ABOUT

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:06.463
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.465
IT THAT THAT THE AT THE TIRES

00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:09.900
LEVELS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.034
HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.702
YOU KNOW ANOTHER THING THAT I'VE

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:14.171
I'VE POINTED OUT IS THAT THE

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.339
THEN CEO PETER DAR RETIRED

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.275
RETIRED WITH A THIRTY EIGHT

00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:20.343
DOLLAR A RETIREMENT BONUS MOSTLY

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.479
BECAUSE IN.

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:25.816
TERMS OF SHARES. TWENTY AUTHORS

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:28.785
THIRTY EIGHT YOU SAID --

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:29.419
THIRTY EIGHT MILLION SORRY

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:29.719
[inaudible]

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.822
YEAH.

00:51:31.888 --> 00:51:33.757
SO THERE IS THAT LACK OF

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:35.892
ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE BOARD IN

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.561
THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL THEN WE JUST

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:39.930
DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE A LOT

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:41.131
OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:42.399
THEY'VE ADOPTED.

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:44.568
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO THEM OR TO

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:45.902
US WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:48.438
WORKING MOST EFFECTIVELY.

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:50.707
SO IT IS A IN IN THE ONE OF THE

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:51.975
THE AUDITOR'S SAID TO ME THEY

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.977
WERE JUST TAKING EVERY GOOD IDEA

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:55.378
THE SOMEBODY CAME UP WITH IT AND

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:56.413
TRYING IT.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.049
BUT WITHOUT THE TOOLS IN PLACE

00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:00.517
TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHICH

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.486
WERE EFFECTIVE WHEN WE'RE NOT

00:52:02.552 --> 00:52:03.253
AFFECTIVE.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.455
AND SO THAT TO ME IS IS IS

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:06.923
ANOTHER SET OF CHALLENGES THAT

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.091
WE HAVE TO ADDRESS.

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:09.960
THEY THEY THAT I I'LL BE HAPPY

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:11.127
TO SEND YOU THE REPORT IT'S

00:52:11.194 --> 00:52:13.330
CLASSIC COVERS ABOUT HUNDRED

00:52:13.396 --> 00:52:14.764
FORTY PAGES IT'S VERY COMPLETE.

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:16.233
WE ASKED WE ACTUALLY MADE A

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:18.468
SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WE

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:19.936
ALSO HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT IN

00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:21.638
ASKING QUESTIONS WE CONTINUE TO

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:23.006
FIND AT THEIR LEADERSHIP

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:26.042
PROBLEMS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION --

00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:27.744
AND SO WE'RE NOW AT THE POINT

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:29.412
WHAT'S THE RIGHT REMEDY.

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:31.448
AND WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU FIND

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:33.884
THAT KIND OF OF OF CHALLENGES

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.819
WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION. FIVE

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:38.455
YEARS AFTER THE END STARTED THIS

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.023
PROCESS.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.125
IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:43.593
TO HAVE A GOOD RECORD AND TO

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.328
PROVE THAT THAT ADDITIONAL STEPS

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.030
ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE WERE

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:48.832
PROCEDURAL ORGANIZATION WE HAVE

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:51.501
TO BE TRANSPARENT WE CAN'T MAKE.

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.970
IMPORTANT CHANGES TO A LARGE

00:52:54.037 --> 00:52:56.072
CORPORATION WITHOUT HAVING A

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:57.507
GOOD BASIS FOR DOING.

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:59.242
NOW THE QUESTION IS.

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:01.478
WHAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:02.979
ACTUALLY IMPROVE SAFETY?

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:04.848
WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.550
WE'VE HAD I'D SEE OTHER THING I

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.218
SPENT THE WEEKEND READING IS IS

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:10.253
COMMENTS IN THE SAFETY CULTURE

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.555
AUDIT OF P. JEANNIE.

00:53:11.621 --> 00:53:13.890
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE GONE SO FAR AS

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.792
TO PROPOSE MUNICIPAL IS ATION OF

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.994
THE COMPANY BREAKING IT UP INTO

00:53:18.061 --> 00:53:19.896
SMALLER UNITS SEPARATING OFF THE

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:22.132
GAS UTILITY PUTTING PUBLIC

00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:23.400
MEMBERS ON THE BOARDS?

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:26.503
SO WE HAVE SUCH A ROBUST ENOUGH --

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.305
ON THE RECORD NOW THAT WE CAN

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.040
ACTUALLY START TO ANALYZE IT TO

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:32.275
MAKE SUGGESTIONS I SUSPECT THAT

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:33.710
THEY WILL BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:35.845
KINDS OF ISSUES ON A RISE IN THE

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:39.015
GOVERNOR SIXTY DAY PLAN OR IN

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.717
THE BANKRUPTCY.

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:41.651
SO SAID TO HELP A LITTLE BIT

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:42.586
JUST REAL QUICK YOU SAID

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:44.354
BEHAVIORS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:45.555
BUT YOU JUST I THINK YOU

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:47.390
DISCUSSED NINETEEN PROGRAMS THAT

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:49.125
WERE ADOPTED THAT YOU SAID THAT

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:51.161
THEY HAD TO COMPLY WITH --

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.395
ARE THOSE PROGRAMS ARE YOU

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:53.530
TALKING ABOUT ALL THE GREAT

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:54.965
IDEAS THAT PEOPLE PUT TOGETHER

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.967
AS MANY THAT WORK IS THAT WE'RE

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:58.602
TRYING TO MANY AS NINETEEN

00:53:58.668 --> 00:53:59.502
PROGRAMS AND BUT THE THE

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:02.038
CHALLENGE BECOMES IS IT MAYBE

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:02.505
SOME OF THEM DO WORK.

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:04.708
BUT IF YOU HAVE TO THINK OF

00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:05.842
NINETEEN DIFFERENT CHECKLIST

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.777
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE FIELD

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:08.078
[inaudible]

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:10.747
SOMETIMES.

00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:13.717
MORE IS ACTUALLY LESS.

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:14.284
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING QUICK

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:15.385
DECISIONS.

00:54:15.452 --> 00:54:17.520
ON THE BEST WAY TO CLAMP DOWNA

00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:19.189
LEAKING --

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:21.257
PLASTIC GAS PIPE.

BUT I DID.

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.018
IT WELL WHY THESE REPORTING

IN THE PLAN WAS WAS GOING TO BE

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:57.974
FINISHED BY ME USE OF DRUGS YES

00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:58.808
USE OF DRONES IN THAT THE PLAN

WITH THESE INSPECTIONS BY MAY I

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:03.446
THINK IS THE TIMELINE THAT THEY

GAVE BUT AS PART OF THESE

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:06.216

SENATE AND ACID IN A TIMELY

00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:51.694
MANNER SO OUR ENGINEERS CAN

00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:52.762

THEM AND IN SOME CASES --

00:58:58.468 --> 00:58:59.836
IN TWO CASES OF ACTUALLY GOING

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.571
OUT TO THE SIDES AND LOOKING FOR

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:03.373

WEBSITE'S UP SO WE WILL SEND YOU

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:09.712

THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT THE

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:12.916
SECOND ONE IS OF KIND OF LOOKING

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:14.951
AT THAT SAME CULTURE THAT --

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.753
SENATOR RUBIO WAS MENTIONED YOU

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:18.288

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:22.158
REPORT FROM --

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:25.128
IT IT'S INTERESTING AS LAST YEAR

00:59:25.194 --> 00:59:26.596
WHEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:27.964
JUDGE MADE THE COMMENTS ABOUT

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.399
THE CULTURE P. JEANNIE STATING

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:32.201
THAT IT'S THEIR SAFETY CULTURES

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:33.736
LIKE CHECK IN THE BOX IN.

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:35.438
WHICH IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE AND

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:36.906
THE OTHER PART WAS I THINGS LIKE

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:38.308
WINDOW DRESSING AND I THINK HOW

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:39.676
HE WAS DESCRIBED.

00:59:39.742 --> 00:59:42.712
BUT IT IN THE PHASE --

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.047
ONE THE THE RECOMMENDATION.

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:45.214
WERE.

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:46.416
SOME OF THOSE WERE FOR THE

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:49.118
COMMISSION NOT JUST PGN.

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:50.019
EIGHT BECAUSE OF THE PHASE ONE

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:51.587
DECISION WAS CONSPICUOUSLY

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:53.089
ABSENT.

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:55.325
WITH ANY COMMENT ON CHANGES THE

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:57.260
COMMISSION MIGHT BE GOING

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:58.895
THROUGH TO SELF IMPLEMENT SOME

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:00.496
OF THESE CHANGES SO HOW'S THE

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.465
COMMISSION IMPLEMENTED OR LOOK

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:03.833
AT SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.968
WHICH ARE APPLIED TO THE

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:09.772
COMMISSION.

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.274
I CAN I CAN PROBABLY SPEAK A

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:14.010
LITTLE MORE CLEARLY TO THE THE

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:15.311
EARLIER YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:18.114
REVIEW COMMISSION AND SO WE HAVE

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:20.149
MADE STRONG EFFORTS TO REALLY

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:22.685
TRY TO BUILD A STRONGER SAFETY

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:24.187
ENFORCEMENT DIVISION.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:25.788
AND I THINK WE'VE MADE PROGRESS

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:27.824
I THINK THAT THAT WE STILL ARE

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.625
UP AGAINST THAT NATURAL

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:31.461
LIMITATION DO WE HAVE THIS RATE

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.629
MAKING AGENCY.

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:35.264
THAT THAT DEPENDS ON AUDIT. ONE

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.599
OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WITH

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:38.468
THAT WAS RECOMMENDED THERE AND I

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.470
BELIEVE MY IS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.605
WAS RECOMMENDED BY A NOR STAR.

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:45.475
IS THAT WE DEVELOP A A TRUE

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:49.078

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:05.261
TO ACTUALLY GET A TRUE GRADUATED

ENFORCEMENT THAT'S WHAT YOU

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:31.254
WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.822
UNFORTUNATE POLICY.

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.090
WE DON'T HAVE.

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.025
CITATION AUTHORITY IN A VARIETY

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:38.161
OF AREAS I JUST SAW A FILING

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.263
FROM THE LARGE ENERGY USERS

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:42.065
COALITION SAYING THAT.

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:42.999
THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT THEY

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.467
WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY BECAUSE WE

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:45.868
DIDN'T HAVE CITATION AUTHORITIES

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:48.271
THAT'S NEWS TO ME TO HAVE IT IN

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:48.905
A COUPLE OF AREAS OF ME TO HAVE

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:49.572
THE GAP.

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:51.074

SERIOUSLY AND THERE'S A VARIETY

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.614
OF AREAS WERE BECOMES A PROBLEM.

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:01.184
I THINK ONE AREA IS IN THE AREA

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.453

WIND AND WEATHER CONDITIONS.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.228
IT SEEMS TO PREVENT VEGETATION

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:54.130
WITHIN SIX INCHES OF A UTILITY

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:55.531
LINES SO LONG AS IT'S OF

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.567
SUFFICIENT STRENGTH AND AND I

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.000
GUESS IT.

01:03:58.067 --> 01:03:59.769
I AM I INTERPRETING THE

OVERSIGHT AND THAT'S SOMETHING I

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:06.209
WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.877

FIRE AT THIS TIME AND ADDRESSING

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.347
THAT COLLABORATIVELY BECAUSE

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.015
SOMETHING WE DIDN'T HAVE WAS THE

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.784
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:15.585
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HOW

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.553
FAR DOES HALF AS WE GO TO THE

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.255
SITE SO WE SEE THAT --

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.590
FOR QUESTIONING IT OURSELVES AND

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:21.857
TAKING A VERY HARD LOOK AT IT

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:25.494
WITH CALIFORNIA IS THAT --

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.797
IN SO YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:31.133
SUFFICIENT STRENGTH AND RIGIDITY --

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.401

THE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IS THAT.

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.308
ALMOST THE WITH A GET OUT OF

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:42.044
JAIL FREE CARD BUT IT IS AT A

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:43.279
ONE REASON WHY THE FEW SEE IS

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.181
NOT BEEN TAKING A MORE ACTIVE --

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:48.351
AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTION ON

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.518
SOME OF THESE FIRES IT WOULDN'T.

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.854
BECAUSE OF THIS EXCEPTION.

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.022
I DON'T KNOW IF I'D GO THAT FAR

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:55.491
CENTER BUT I WOULD SAY IS AS

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.326
ROBBINS CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:58.160

WANTED TO ADDRESS IT QUICKLY --

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:03.466

BEST PRACTICES THAT WE ADOPTED --

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:27.923

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:53.749
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE --

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:55.284
IN TERMS OF OTHER MITIGATION AT

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:57.620

GIVE CONCERNS ABOUT --

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.929
LACK OF ACCESS TO IT IN SORT OF

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:09.065
THIS UPCOMING FIRE SEASON THE

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.367
ACTUAL SUPPLY OF SOME OF THE NEW

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.169
TECHNOLOGIES THEIR UTILIZING TO

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.704
ACTUALLY GET OUT ON THE LINE IN

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.839
ADDITION TO THE LINE HARDENING

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:17.707
IN SOME THE VEGETATION

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.208
MANAGEMENT WE KNOW FIRE CAMERAS

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.743
HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED PRETTY

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:21.210
SUCCESSFULLY BUT I'VE.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.712

WE'RE WHERE WE ARE SO JUST A

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:36.258
BRIEF COMMENT ON ON THAT

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:36.559
[inaudible]

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:37.593
THE FIRE.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.861
I HEARD ABOUT THE FIRE CAMERAS

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:40.029
I'VE BEEN FOCUSED A LITTLE BIT

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:42.732
MORE ON THAT THERE'S A LIABILITY

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:45.067
RISK. TO SOME OF THE VEGETATION

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:46.836
MANAGEMENT COMPANIES SO ONE OF

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:49.205
THE LARGER OF THE COMPANIES TO

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:50.740
ACTUALLY CONTRACT WITH THE

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:54.477
UTILITIES. TO TAKE DOWN TREES ON

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:56.479
TO MEET THE NEW STANDARDS HIS

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.981
ACTUALLY BEEN TOLD INTERNALLY BY

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:00.583
THEIR RISK MANAGERS THAT IF

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:02.618
THERE'S A FIRE.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.286
THEY COULD BE LIABLE.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.654
AND THAT THEY'RE LEAVING THE

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:08.290
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.859
AND SO THAT THAT THAT THAT WE

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:11.260
ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:14.029
SHORTAGES IT'S TRUE THAT SOME OF

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:15.798
THE UTILITIES ARE REALLY FRONT

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.299
LOADING THEIR EXPENDITURES.

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:18.734
OTHERS ARE BEING A LITTLE MORE

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.436
MEASURED IN TRYING TO FOCUS ON

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:21.570
VERY.

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:23.739
SPECIFIC AREAS THAT THEY THINK

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:26.208
ARE HIGH HAZARD.

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:27.209
AND SO YOU KNOW.

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:28.411
I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S THE

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:30.112
RIGHT APPROACH.

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:31.981
AND I'M BELT AND SUSPENDERS

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:34.884
PERSON BUT IT'S PROBABLY.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.986
IF YOU HAVE GOOD JUDGMENT YOU

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:39.555
CAN PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH ABOUT.

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:40.856
N. P. GINNY NOTED AT THE

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:42.391
WORKSHOP --

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.692
THE FIRST WORKSHOP FOR THAT'S

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:44.693
BEEN ON ONE IMPLEMENTATION WITH

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.761
ACTUAL PERCENT OF THE WATER

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:47.430
MITIGATION PLANS THEY DID NOT AS

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:48.531
A CONCERN --

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:50.399
IN TERMS OF THE FIRE AND THE

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:51.033
CAMERAS AND THE WEATHER STATIONS

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.469
THAT SO THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:54.937
VERIFIED --

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.272
BUT THAT WAS NOTED AND AS WELL

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:57.740
AS PRESIDENT PICKER SAID ON THE

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:59.375
ACTUAL CRUISE A GOING TO THIS

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.010
VISITATION MANAGEMENT --

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:02.645
IT IT'S REACHED A POINT.

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:03.779
AGAIN REPORTED BY SOME THE

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.114
UTILITIES THAT THEY'VE REACHED A

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.583
CRITICAL MASS OF THERE'S JUST NO

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:08.784
MORE CREWS TO HIRE --

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.352
SHOWED.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:12.621
FURTHER RISK MITIGATION TOOL AT

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.290
LEAST.

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:15.391
FOR AGGRESSIVE USE OF PUBLIC

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.959
SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF WHICH I

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:18.928
KNOW IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:20.529
YOU ALL HAVE BEEN --

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.865
PUTTING FORWARD BUT OBVIOUSLY A

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.133
LOT OF PUSH BACK FROM THE

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.069
COMMUNITIES ON THAT FRONT NO ONE

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:29.205
WANTS THEIR POWER SHUT OFF --

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:30.906
BUT YOU KNOW IN CERTAIN

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.308
CIRCUMSTANCES IS NECESSARY BUT%

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:34.076
WAYS TO MINIMIZE THAT DOWNSIDE

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:35.911
RISK WONDERING HOW YOU GUYS ARE

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.214
PRIORITIZING --

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.816
THE LEGISLATURE PASSED TO

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:41.450
THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE LAST YEAR

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:42.885
ON MICRO GRIDS THERE'S ALSO TALK

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.386
ABOUT BETTER BATTERY BACKUP

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.888
POWER IT'S SORT OF CRITICAL

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.723
INFRASTRUCTURE SAY PUMPING

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.658
STATIONS FIRE STATIONS.

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.227
SO I KNOW YOU GOTTA WALK AND

01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:53.195
CHEW GUM AND FIX A CAR AND RIDE

01:08:53.262 --> 01:08:54.530
A BIKE AND DO EVERYTHING ALL AT

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:56.065
THE SAME TIME BUT JUST WONDER

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.032
WHERE THAT FALLS ON YOUR

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.300
PRIORITY LIST.

01:08:58.367 --> 01:09:01.837
IN TERMS OF SORT OF EXPEDITED.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.172
THE ACQUISITION YOU KNOW IT

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:04.507
ESPECIALLY IN A HIGH FIRE

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.075
SEVERITY ZONES FOR THE FOR THAT

01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:07.276
KIND OF TECHNOLOGY --

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.011
OF THE LET IT ED RANDOLPH ANSWER

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.513
THIS YOU DID THAT VERY WELL IN

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.914
THE ASSEMBLY SO I GUESS SO WELL

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.949
I MEAN I'M JUST YET NARROWLY ON

01:09:14.016 --> 01:09:15.251
TO THAT QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:16.719
PRIVATIZATION OF THE MICRO GRADE

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:18.654
BILL --

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:22.224
THERE IS A CHANGE PROPOSAL

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:24.126
PENDING FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:25.561
FOR SEVERAL STAFF --

01:09:25.628 --> 01:09:27.796
POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THAT THE

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:30.032
ANSWER NORMALLY WE WOULD --

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.667
LARGELY WAIT UNTIL THE STAFF IN

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.068
PLACE TO DO THAT HOWEVER GIVEN

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.603
THE PRIORITY THAT WE HAVE

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.772
JUGGLED SOME STAFF AROUND.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.074
ON TO START DOING THE WORK ON

01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:40.976
THAT BILL ON WELL AHEAD OF TIME

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:42.344
ANTICIPATING.

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:45.214
THAT AS THE COMMISSION DEVELOPS --

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.583
MORE PROTOCOLS AROUND SHUT OFFS

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:50.019
ON THAT ISSUES LIKE MICROGRAMS

01:09:50.085 --> 01:10:07.202
AND BEHIND THE METER STORAGE

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.059
CAUSE FOR SIGNIFICANT CONCERN

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:59.628
AND I WOULD JUST SAY I WOULD ASK --

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:01.296
THE THE PRECEDING THAT'S UNDER

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.931
WAY -- UNDER

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.766
SB THREE EIGHTY TO ASSESS THE

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.468
FEASIBILITY A CLOSURE WHICH THIS

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.970
GOVERNOR ALREADY COMMITTED TO

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.538
DURING HIS CAMPAIGN BUT THAT.

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.640
THE THAT THAT ASSESSMENT SEEMS

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.275
TO BE BASED ON ASSUMPTION OF

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.077
BUSINESS AS USUAL UNDER UNDER

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:17.746
PREVIOUS LAW IN OTHER WORDS.

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.781
THERE'S NO ANTICIPATION OF THE

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:21.783
W. P. --

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:22.417
SHUDDERING.

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:23.952
EVENTUALLY CLOSING DOWN THEIR

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.454
GAS PLANTS THERE'S NO ASSUMPTION

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.622
OF SB ONE HUNDRED PASSING

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:29.391
THERE'S NO ASSUMPTION OF A HUGE

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:32.127
MARKET PENETRATION UNDER SB

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.495
FORTY SEVEN SEVEN AND ELECTRIC

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:34.129
HEAT PUMPS AND OTHER

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:34.696
OPPORTUNITIES SO.

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.465
ARE HAVE WE SORT OF ALREADY

01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:38.867
RIGGED THAT PROCEEDING TO COME

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:40.636
TO A CONCLUSION OR IS IT ALREADY

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:41.970
IS A P. C. STILL OPEN MINDED

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:42.971
ABOUT.

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:46.241
THE FUTURE OF SORT OF TECHNOLOGY

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:48.477
INNOVATIONS ABILITY TO TO MEET

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:49.678
SOME OF THE GAPS BECAUSE THEY

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:52.014
ARE NOT EVEN ASSUMING ANDREA

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.781
FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OR THREE

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:54.149
EIGHTY I'M SAYING THE THREE

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:54.983
EIGHTY PROCEEDING LOOKING THE

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.752
FEASIBILITY OF CLOSURE DOESN'T

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.453
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT NEW ADVANCES

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.289
IN BATTERY TECHNOLOGY.

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:01.423
NEW ADVANCE AN ELECTRIC HEAT

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.558
PUMPS AS WELL AS SB ONE HUNDRED

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.626
AND AND GAS --

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:09.598
PLANT CLOSURE I'M VERY

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:12.434
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT BOY THOSE

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:13.936
BECAUSE WE DON'T CONTROL THE

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.103
BUILDING STANDARDS AND I WE HAD

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.605
THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT AND THE

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:18.774
IN A I'M FROM VERY OPTIMISTIC I

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.609
JUST DON'T SEE THE WILLINGNESS

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:22.177
THERE TO ACTUALLY DEPLOY IT.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.880
SO AGAIN BELTS AND SUSPENDERS.

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:26.214
RIGHT BUT I'M ASKING ABOUT THE

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:27.549
UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OF THE SB

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:30.152
THREE PRECEDING.

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:30.852
IN IN IN I. UNDER MY RELATING

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:33.689
ASSUMPTION FOURTEEN SEVENTY

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:34.690
SEVEN IS LA COUNTY WILL PERFORM.

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.325
SOME ESTIMATE THREE I DON'T I'M

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:38.427
NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT THE

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:39.361
COULD ASSIGN COMMISSION ON THAT

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:40.729
ANY ANSWER THAT BUT I WILL SAY

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.065
I'M VERY FEARFUL THAT IF WE

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:44.366
BUILD THOSE EXEMPTIONS AND BASED

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.368
ON WHAT I'M SEEING AROUND THEIR

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.370
RESPONSE AND FOR ONLY.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:49.137
SEVENTY SEVEN AGREED AND YOU CAN

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:50.605
WILL DO ANY SIX THOUSAND NEW

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:56.578
UNITS AND ON YOUR GAS IF YOU

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:59.715
ACTUALLY WANT ELECT I AM SO.

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:01.383
IT SENATOR ON THE THREE EIGHTY

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.018
PROCEEDING WHICH BECAUSE OF

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:03.785
THAT'S A COMMISSIONER RANDOLPH'S

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:05.420
PROCEEDING AND BECAUSE OF BAGLEY

01:17:05.487 --> 01:17:06.722
KEENE ROLES HARD FOR IT

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:07.589
COMMISSIONERS TO TALK TO EACH

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:08.924
OTHER KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:10.092
THE PRECEDING DETAILS.

01:17:10.158 --> 01:17:13.161
ON HI I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT IN

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:14.396
WHAT SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.098
IN THE INITIAL ROUND OF MODELING --

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:17.933
BUT WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.835
COMMUNICATING WHAT WE INTEND IS

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:20.836
THE NEXT STEP.

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:21.970
I'M IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:25.107
MODELING IS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:26.942
HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS --

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.610
NOW IN WATER THE CONSTRAINTS

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:31.046
THERE ON THE NEXT ROUND IS THEN

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:33.515
WHERE YOU CAN GO IN AND SAY OKAY

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:35.584
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE OUT A WHOLE

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.352
LOT OF CONSERVATION --

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:40.055
WHAT HAPPENS WE DRAMATICALLY GAS

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:42.524
DEMAND AT THE PEAK PERIODS WHAT

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:43.992
HAPPENS IF --

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:45.961
YOU CLOSE DOWN THE FIELD AND

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.896
INSTEAD INSTALL MUCH MORE

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.664
PIPELINE CAPACITY BOTH SO YOU

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.433
CAN GET MORE IN THE STATE IN A

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.534
LOT OF REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:54.970
USE PIPELINES AS A STORAGE MEDIA.

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:56.772
I'M SO THAT'S JUST NOT THIS

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:57.806
ROUND -- YOU

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:58.740
KNOW IT'S ANOTHER ONE THESE

01:17:58.807 --> 01:17:59.441
PLACES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:00.909
GREAT STORY TO TELL ON OUR

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:02.177
TIMING --

01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:05.347
OTHER THAN THIS IS THIS TYPE OF

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:07.816
MODELING ON THE GAS SYSTEM IS

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:09.317
NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE EXPERTISE

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:12.187
ON AND I THINK IT IS AS YOU'RE

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:13.455
AWARE --

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:14.756
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:15.991
COUNTRY THAT HAVE EXPERTISE ON

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:17.893
IT OTHER THAN THE UTILITY SO WE

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:19.594
REALLY STRUGGLED IN THE EARLY

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.997
YEARS OF THIS ON HOW TO DO SOME

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:23.231
OF THIS MODELING.

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:26.001
ON IN A WAY THAT THECOMMUNITY

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.536
HAD CONFIDENCE.

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:28.870
THAT.

01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:30.605
IT WAS GOING TO BE IT WASN'T

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:31.706
GOING TO BE A BIASED MODEL

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:34.042
BECAUSE SO CAL GAS.

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:35.510
IS THE ONE WHO OWNS THE MODELING

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:36.812
SOFTWARE I THINK WE'VE WORKED

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.080
OUT NOW --

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:39.014
BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:42.551
CONTRACTING PROBLEMS --

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:46.588
IN WORKING WITH --

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:49.558
SOME GOOD NEWS ONLINE TO THIRTY

01:18:49.624 --> 01:18:50.725
FIVE IS THE MOST RECENT

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:54.763

PAGES --

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:29.731
PAGE.

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:32.134
SIXTY TWO UNDER UTILITY SAFETY --

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.369
THERE IS UNDER GROUNDING WITH

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.138

LOVE TO UNDERGROUND AND FEEL

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:48.683
LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.085
THAT FUNDING SO MAYBE YOU CAN

YOUR DISTRICT PROBABLY DO HAVE

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:55.624
ACCESS TO THE FUNDING BUT THIS

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:57.192
IS A BEAUTIFICATION FUND.

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:58.793
THIS IS NOT A SAFETY FUND THIS

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.262
WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:02.831
BEAUTIFICATION OF DOWNTOWN'S BY

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:05.667
ALLOWING --

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.736
TO UNDER GROUNDING THERE.

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:09.938
BECAUSE OF THE DENSITIES.

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:10.505
SO YOU'RE SERVING A LOT OF

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:12.274
CUSTOMERS SO THE WAY THAT IT

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:15.844
WORKS IS THAT EVERY YEAR.

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:17.245
COMMUNITIES GET A CREDIT.

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.713
AND YOU CAN ACCUMULATE THE

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.649
CREDITS UNTIL YOU GET TO THE

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:22.217
POINT WHERE YOU CAN PAY FOR YOUR

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:23.418
SHARE.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.452
OF THE UNDER GROUNDING IS A

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.454
LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEN YOU CAT

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:27.722
YOU'VE PUT YOUR MONEY UP YOU

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:29.524

DO THE UNDER GROUNDING.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.596
IT'S A CHALLENGES WELL FOR THE

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.665
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THIS

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:39.134
BECAUSE HE CAN'T JUST DO. FOR

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.569
BEAUTIFICATION.

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.037
THE ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE THEY

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:43.238
HAVE TO GET THE TELCOS TO

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:44.739
PARTICIPATE.

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:45.807
AND THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:47.475
AUTHORITY OVER THEM AND NOR

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:48.877
THERE DO WE IN THE SAME WAY WE

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:50.345
HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE THEIR

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:51.379
TELCO SO.

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:53.081
SOME PEOPLE WILL ACCUMULATE

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:54.716
THEIR CREDITS AND THEY'LL

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:56.885
ACTUALLY SALAM TO OTHER CITIES

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:58.553
SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY A MASS

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.355
THE CREDITS MORE QUICKLY TO DO

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:01.489
THEIR PROJECTS.

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:05.227
BUT GENERALLY THESE ARE TO THE

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:06.661
LAW WAS PASSED FOR

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.430
BEAUTIFICATION PURPOSES.

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:11.099
AND IT TENDS TO WORK BEST IN

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:13.268
PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE REAL DENSE

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:15.570
POPULATIONS LIKE DOWNTOWN

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.706
CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:19.241
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:20.709
IS WHAT WITH THE PROGRAM LOOK

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:22.277
LIKE IF IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.946
AIMED AT SAFETY.

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:32.654
THEN HOW CAN I HELP YOU DO THAT.

YOUR STAFF WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.335
MOVE MORE QUICKLY ON BUT THE

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:48.937
COSTS ARE GOING TO BE VERY HIGH.

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:51.306
AND SO ON THE QUESTION WILL BE

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:56.478
SHOULD THEY BE SOCIALIZED

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:58.280
THROUGHOUT THE RATE BASE.

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:01.416

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:07.816
HAVE BEEN HIT BY CARS IN THE

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:10.385
LAST TEN YEARS AND KNOCKED OVER

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:11.720
BECAUSE THERE WOULD NAY SNAPPING.

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:13.355
MANY BLOCKED ONE OF THE THREE

IT'S JUST BEEN A REAL MESS BUT I

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:35.210
WAS I WAS HAVING TROUBLE TRYING

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.911
TO FIGURE OUT.

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.246

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.948
TRYING TO COMMUNICATE?

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:42.317
WELL SO AS WE LOOK AT THE THE

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:44.486
VAST LANDSCAPE OF POLLS THEY

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:46.654
PRESENT AN ENORMOUS CUSTOMER

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:47.956
VALUE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:49.090
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE REALLY

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:50.625
LIKE TO THINK ABOUT.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.327
BUT THE KERRY AT THE TOP AND YOU

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:54.996
CAN SEE THAT AND IN THIS PICTURE --

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:57.899
THE THE THREE PHASE ALTERNATING

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:58.967
CURRENT.

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:03.438
DOWN BELOW YOU CAN SEE ONE TWO

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:04.072
THREE FOUR FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:06.808
OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.343
THAT IS THE THAT IS WHAT DRIVES

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.545
THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:11.913
TELECOMMUNICATIONS IS THEIR

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.082
ABILITY TO FIND ACCESS TO THIS

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:15.617
NETWORK OF POLLS A CONNECTS

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.252
EVERY HOME EVERY BUSINESS EVERY

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:19.354
COMMUNITY.

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:20.321
AND SO --

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:23.691
HOW DO WE ACTUALLY TWO OF VALUE

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:25.894
POLLS WELL HOW DO WE ACTUALLY

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.362
START -- TO

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:28.396
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S

01:24:28.463 --> 01:24:30.265
PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:32.467
ACCESS TO THIS NETWORK HOW DO WE

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:34.536
ACTUALLY USE THAT TO ACTUALLY

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:36.871
IMPROVE THE OVERALL SAFETY AND

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.306
RELIABILITY --

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.442
HERE EVERYBODY SAVE MONEY

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:41.576
BECAUSE HE PUT IT CLOSE TO THE

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:42.744
ROAD WITH THEIR EQUIPMENT COULD

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.245
BE NOW THE ROAD PROBABLY GREW IN

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.314
SIZE FROM MAYBE A DIRT TRACK TO

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:49.284
A PAVED HIGHWAY AND THEN --

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.084
TO PAVED ROAD TWO LANE ROAD AND

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:51.719
THEN A PAVED WITH THE WITH THE

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:54.422
LITTLE BIT OF A A MARGIN SO.

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:55.957
THE YOU KNOW THIS IS A CHALLENGE

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:57.725
EVEN FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:59.160
THEIR PARTICIPATION TO REALLY

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:01.029
THINK ABOUT THE VALUE OF THAT

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:03.398
NETWORK HOW DO WE TURN THAT INTO

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:04.732
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM.

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.067
THIS IS GOING TO BECOME MORE

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:08.002
COMPETITIVE IN THIS IS THIS IS A

01:25:08.069 --> 01:25:09.971
DIET STRESS THIS FOR PEOPLE AS

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:11.339
WE MOVE TOWARDS FIVE G..

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:14.342
EVERYBODY WANTS MORE ROBUST.

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:16.377
MOBILE BROADBAND THAT'S FIVE G.

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:18.379
AS A BROADCAST TECHNOLOGY WHAT

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:20.315
IS IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:21.082
BROADCAST.

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:25.487
THE NEEDS ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY.

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.521
IT NEEDS ACCESS TO FIBER IN

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:28.122
NEEDS TO BE ABOUT EVERY THREE

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.924
HUNDRED FEET.

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:32.427
AND IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE AIR.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.696
SO WE UNDERGROUND ALL THIS THERE

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.197
MAY BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.232
PUSHING THEIR AUTONOMOUS

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.633
VEHICLES BECAUSE IS NOT GETTING

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.001
DIRECTION.

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:42.470
SO I THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT'S

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:43.838
THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:25:43.905 --> 01:25:47.075
AND SO WOULD POLLS ARE STILL.

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.109
YOU KNOW NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT TO

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:49.344
OWN ONE THERE'S NOT A

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:51.646
COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACE AND IT

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:53.014
IS THE NATURAL MONOPOLY.

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:56.251
BUT HE BRINGS VALUE TO PEOPLE.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:57.685
THEN ON A PAGE ELEVEN THE CHAIRS

01:25:57.752 --> 01:26:00.455
ARE READY.

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:01.956
KIND OF HAMMER ON THIS A LITTLE

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.391
BIT AND THAT'S ON YOUR RATE

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.126
CASES AND SO.

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:06.127
YOU KNOW THE SENATOR I GET TO

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:08.029
HEAR STORIES OF THREE YEARS FOUR

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.831
YEARS FIVE YEARS --

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:11.065
WE'RE STARTING OUR NEXT RATE

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:13.167
INCREASE REQUEST AND WE HAVEN'T

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:14.602
FINISHED THE OLD ONE AND I'M.

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:15.703
A GUY YOU KNOW I'M NEW TO THIS

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:17.438
COMMITTEE SO I'M ASKING KIND OF

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:21.242
BASIC QUESTIONS BUT WHAT WHAT

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:23.611
WOULD BE THE REASON.

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:25.179
FOR SO USE BE PRETTY SIMPLE THE

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:28.683
UTILITIES BASICALLY ARE ARE

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.385
EITHER BY OUR LIKELY PHONE

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:31.786
COMPANIES AND ALL BECAUSE YOU

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:32.487
LOOK AT SUCH A BROAD

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:33.555
JURISDICTION ALL OF THEM HAVE

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.557
BECOME MUCH MORE COMPLICATED

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:38.192
OVER TIME BECAUSE THE THE

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:40.662
SENSUAL NATURE OF OF WHAT THEY

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.497
DO SO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:43.932
THE WATER COMPANIES.

01:26:43.998 --> 01:26:48.703
NOW ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH I

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.838
HAVE TO DEAL WITH --

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:52.941
MORE DEPENDENCE ON GROUND WATER

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.476
IN SOME PLACES WERE BUYING WATER

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:57.779
IAN COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND SO

01:26:57.845 --> 01:26:59.213
THEY BECOME MORE COMPLICATED

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.982
ENTITIES IT TAKES MORE TIME TO

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.483
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THE

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:04.852
MONEY THEY REALLY NEED IS.

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.020
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:07.422
JUST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:08.489
THEY NEED.

01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:10.058
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:13.094
ACTUALLY ON SHARING THE COSTS

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:16.064
EQUALLY WITH DIFFERENT CLASSES

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:16.898
OF CUSTOMERS.

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.533
YOU HAVE WATER COMPANIES THAT

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:22.070
ACTUALLY HAVE BECOME NOT JUST A

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:24.072
LOCAL WATER COMPANY BUT THEY OWN.

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:25.740
DISK CONTIGUOUS.

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:27.241
WATER COMPANIES THROUGHOUT THE

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:28.643
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THE

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:31.579
PROVIDE YOU UNIFIED RATE CASE.

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:33.381
SO THEWORLD'S BECOME MUCH MORE

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:35.650
CLUTTERING IN AND DIFFICULT

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:36.918
FORCE EVEN THERE.

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:38.353
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER PLACES

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:40.355
WORRY WE JUST NEED TO REALLY GET

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:42.323
BAD RIGHT AND SO FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:45.960
SMALL REGULATED --

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:47.629
OF PHONE COMPANIES.

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:49.430
CAN YOU STILL TAKE A LONG TIME.

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:50.865
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:54.736
SAME DEGREE OF OF OF ON

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.270
PROCEDURAL ATTENTION.

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:57.138
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A JUDGE YOU

01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:59.107
HAVE TO HAVE HEARINGS YOU HAVE

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:00.842
TO HAVE A PARTY SUBMITTED YOU

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:02.043
HAVE TO HAVE.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.378
EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS ON THEIR

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:06.114
BOOKS AND IF THEY HAVE OF

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.215
SETTLEMENTS IN CASE THERE'S

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:09.083
DISAGREEMENTS FOR YOU HAVE TO

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.885
HAVE A FINAL DECISION.

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.420
IT GOES OUT FOR COMMENT SO SOME

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:14.255
OF IT IS GOING TO TAKE THE TIME

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:15.690
IT TAKES NO MATTER WHAT.

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:17.058
OTHER PLACES IS JUST BECOME

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.293
PHENOMENALLY MORE COMPLICATED

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.162
I'LL SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:22.897
CASES THAT WE DEAL WITH THE TO

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:25.667
SEE YOU SEE HAS GROWN OVER TIME.

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:26.334
SO -- IN A

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:28.302
IN A WORLD WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:30.071
HUNDRED CASES WE NOW HAVE OVER

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.172
FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR.

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:33.441
WE ONLY HAVE FORTY JUDGES SO

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:33.941
THAT PEOPLE CAN BECOME A

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.243
BOTTLENECK.

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:36.944
IS THERE A WAY TO STREAMLINE IT

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:39.580
LIKE -- OF

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:42.650
LIKE AN INFLATION FACTOR.

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:43.885
SO WHAT DOES THAT WOULD THAT

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:44.519
WOULD BE ACCURATE FOR YEARS AND

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:46.254
SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:46.788
FOR I MEAN HOW DOES I GET

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:48.523
REIMBURSED FOR THE FOR THE THE

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:49.991
FOUR YEARS IS REALLY THE BIG

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:51.859
COMPANIES THE REALLY BIG ENERGY

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:53.327
UTILITIES IS USUALLY NOT THE

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:56.097
SMALLER ONES --

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:58.299
AGAIN I I YOU KNOW I THINK WE

01:28:58.366 --> 01:28:59.967
CAN TRIAL THOSE THINGS BUT IT

01:29:00.034 --> 01:29:03.304
DOES OPEN SELF UP.

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:05.740
TO GAMING IN SOME CASES IT

01:29:05.807 --> 01:29:07.675
DOESN'T PROVIDE THE TRANSPARENCY

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:11.145
THAT A LOT OF THE PUBLIC WANTS.

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:12.280
THE AMOUNT OF ANGST AND

01:29:12.346 --> 01:29:14.048
ATTENTION THAT WE GET FROM

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:15.850
CUSTOMERS OF SMALL WATER

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:16.984
COMPANIES.

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:19.253
IS JUST AS BIG AS SOME OF THE

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.822
LARGE ELECTRIC UTILITIES.

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:22.190
AND SO INTO IF YOU WANT TO

01:29:22.256 --> 01:29:24.158
PRESERVE THAT DEMOCRATIC

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:25.560
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.962
CHALLENGE THESE MONOPOLIES.

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:29.530
WE HAVE TO ALLOW THEM TIME TO

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:31.199
REALLY UNDERSTAND THINGS AND TO

01:29:31.265 --> 01:29:34.068
BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. FOUR YOU

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:35.436
COULD JUST GIVE ME THE

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:39.707
OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE EVERYTHING.

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:40.842
WHEN A DEMOCRAT EITHER?

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:42.410
WELL I I RESERVE OR MAYES MISTER

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:43.344
PICKER WITH THE WITH THE WHITE

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:44.712
THAN BREATH OF EVERYTHING THAT

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:46.581

ALSO SEND YOU ONE OF THE BIG

01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:57.091
GREATER.

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:58.893
I WOULD LOVE AN ORCHARD IS A

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.495
AFTER GOING THROUGH THIS.

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:01.863
I WAS I WAS WONDERING.

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:02.997
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE JUST TOO BIG

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.532
I MEAN IF YOU COULD FOCUS JUST

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:05.900
ON A NARROWER.

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:08.002
AREA YOU CAN GET THINGS VERY

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.737
DONE A LITTLE FASTER.

01:30:09.804 --> 01:30:10.538
WE CAN DROP IT UP INTO WE'VE

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:12.273
SUGGESTED THAT IN THE PAST AND

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:14.575
WE WE TEND TO RUN UP AGAINST --

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:16.744
CONSTITUTIONAL DEFINITION SUTTER

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:18.679
CHALLENGES WAS STATUTORY

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:21.015
DEFINITIONS SO THERE'S IF YOU

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:22.517
WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER RUN AT IT I

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:23.885
THINK WE WOULD AGREE THAT A

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:27.722
LEANER ORGANIZATIONS SMALLER.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:28.389
SCOPE OF WHAT WE DEAL WITH MIGHT

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.324
BE HELPFUL.

01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:32.160
RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:34.295

YOU MENTIONED --

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.200
JUNIOR ORDER ONE FIFTY SIX THAT

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:40.635
WAS IMPLEMENTED BY MISS MORE

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:42.103
NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.672
AND APPRECIATE THE UPTICK IN

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:47.108
SPENDING BUT OUR DATA SHOWS THAT

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:49.010
MINORITY BUSINESSES ARE NOT

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:49.877
REALLY GROWING IT'S NOT A

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:54.248
GREATER POOL OF MINORITY BILL

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:55.283
WHAT SEEN.

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:57.618
THIS MANY TIMES WHAT WAS A MALE

01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:59.520
OWNED BUSINESS NOW IN IT THE

WIFE OF THE DAUGHTERS NAME.

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:03.958
BUT MY REAL QUESTION IS SOME OF

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:06.994
THE STATE PROGRAMS IN MANDATE.

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:09.230
HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT WHETHER

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:10.598
INTENTIONALLY OR NOT.

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:12.433
ON DIVERSE SPENDING [inaudible]

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.101
SO.

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:16.037
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:18.206
ELECTRIC UTILITIES OWNED ALL OF

01:31:18.272 --> 01:31:20.007
THE GENERATION.

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:23.678
AND THE LEGISLATURE OF IN IN IN

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:25.546

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:28.516
RESPONSIBILITY.

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:31.185
SO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:34.322
POWER PLANTS ARE NOT REGULATED

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:37.491
DIRECTLY WE SIMPLY SEE THE

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:39.093
CONTRACT.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.829
AND SO IS YOU START TO SEE MORE

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:43.564
AND MORE DIFFERENT.

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:46.234
BUSINESS MODELS FOR HOW PEOPLE

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.468
GET THEIR ELECTRICITY.

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:50.371
THEN SOME OF THAT SPENDING THEN

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:54.141
MIGRATES AWAY FROM THE UTILITIES --

NET ENERGY MADE ROOFING FOR

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:58.946
EXAMPLE THOSE CONTRACTORS.

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.982
WHO DO THAT AND THE COMPANIES

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:04.185
WHO PAY THEM ARE NOT SUBJECT? TO

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:07.655
THE VOLUNTARY PROVISIONS OF OF

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:10.625

MEETING WITH THEM A NUMBER OF

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:16.731
TIMES TO TRY TO GET THEM TO

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:18.933
PARTICIPATE AND TO RECOGNIZE THE

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.601
IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROGRAM IN

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.570
TERMS OF BRINGING PROSPERITY

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:23.638
STOOD A DIFFERENT.

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:25.206
ON A COMMUNITIES.

01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:27.441
AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE THE

01:32:27.508 --> 01:32:29.710
THAT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DO

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:32.513

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.315
PARTIAL SOMETIMES OF COME FOR

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.117
WITH PROJECTS BUT YOU DON'T SEE

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:38.019
THAT AS A STANDARD BUSINESS

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:39.654
PRACTICE.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.188
IN THE WAY THAT THE UTILITIES

01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:42.323
HAVE DONE AND I THINK THE

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:44.025
UTILITIES HAVE TRIED HARD. TO

01:32:44.091 --> 01:32:45.559
KEEP PACE WITH SOME OF THE

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:48.162
CHALLENGES THE YOU DESCRIBE.

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:49.730
YOU KNOW THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:52.099
FROM ACTUALLY HAVING CONTRACTORS

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:54.702
WHO ARE DIVERSE BUSINESS FIRMS

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:57.138
TO ACTUALLY DEVELOPING PROGRAMS

01:32:57.204 --> 01:32:58.906
FOR THOSE FIRMS TO THEMSELVES

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:01.442
HAVE DIVERSE SUBCONTRACTORS.

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:02.376
AND THAT'S A VERY HEALTHY THING

01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:05.513
CAUSES X. THE COMPANY GETS

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:06.847
ESTABLISHED IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:08.382
THEN THEY ARE GETTING THE HELP

01:33:08.449 --> 01:33:10.551
THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO FIND

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:12.320
THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND HELP THEM

01:33:12.386 --> 01:33:14.322
ALSO UNDERSTAND HOW TO WORK IN A

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:16.724
SUB CURRENT TRACK TO THE UTILITY.

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.092
MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LONGER

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:19.860
PERIOD SOMETIMES BEFORE YOU'RE

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:22.096
GOING TO GET PAID BACK YOU NEED

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:23.364
TO HAVE AN ON A WILLING BANKER

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:25.166
WHO'S WILLING TO UNDERSTAND.

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:26.968
THE YOU WILL GET PAID BUT TIME

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.135
LINES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:29.403
THAN IT WOULD BE IF YOU ARE IN

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:31.072
SMALL BUSINESS ONLY SERVING

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.373
PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.208
SO YOU JUST NOT SEEING THAT FOR

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:35.743
THESE NEW PARTIES AND I THINK

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:38.079
THAT THAT THE THAT I CONTINUETO

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:39.981
TO THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:42.516
WAYS TO INSPIRE THEM TO THE

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:43.417
GREATNESS.

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:46.253
THE THE OTHER OF PROVIDERS HAVE.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.488
ARM WAS STICKING TO THE

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.390
UTILITIES AREA THAT THEY DO HAVE

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:50.758
DIRECT.

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:52.727
IMPACT ON RIGHT NOW IN THE AREA

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:56.530
THAT WE BOUGHT TOUCH TOUCH UPON

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:58.165
HIS LINE CLEARING.

01:33:58.232 --> 01:33:58.766
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE MINORITY

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.134
FIRM BEING USED FOR VEGETATION

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:00.835
CLEARING IN THE STATE OF

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:01.335
CALIFORNIA.

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:04.972
AND THEY DO EXIST SEOUL WHY NOT

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:05.606
THERE SHINING A LIGHT THERE THE

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:06.440
ENCOURAGED THAT RIGHT NOW

01:34:06.507 --> 01:34:07.908
BECAUSE WE WE'VE ALL TALKED

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:10.044
ABOUT THE NEED OF LINE CLEARING

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:10.611
HELP.

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:12.847
ABATE THESE FIRES BUT YOU'RE NOT

01:34:12.913 --> 01:34:14.582
USING ANY MINORITY CONTRACTORS

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:16.117
TO DO SUCH OKAY THAT'S GOOD

01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:18.386
POINT THANK YOU FOR FOR LETTING

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.856
AND MY SECOND ONE IS --

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:26.727
I MEAN THIRD ISSUE ARCHDIOCESAN

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:27.461
I WANT TO BE ABLE.

THEY'RE NOT HEARING A ONE FIFTY

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:34.435
SIX WE'RE NOT HEARING TO ANY

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:35.803
OTHER THING SO --

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.071
IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE DOES IT MAKE

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:39.173
SENSE TO GIVE THEM MORE

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.208
RESPONSIBILITY BUT LESS

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:43.744
OVERSIGHT.

01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:44.445
NO -- IN

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.013
I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.916
THEM SEVERAL TIMES AND AGAIN

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:50.851
THEY THEY WHAT THEY VIEW IS

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:52.953
THEIR JOB IS TO DO.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.622
SMALL EMPLOYMENT.

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:56.057
THEY DON'T EMPLOYEE BY THE NO

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:57.825
THEY DO AROUND THEIR CONTRACTORS

01:34:57.892 --> 01:34:59.827
TO BUILD THESE SMALL PROJECTS

01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:01.295
THE DOING THEIR DISTRICT.

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.364
THEY DON'T DO THAT ON SOME THEIR

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:04.999
LARGER CONTRACTS BUT THEY

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:07.234
THEMSELVES DON'T DON'T HAVE

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.602
PROGRAMS LIKE THIS SO USUALLY

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:10.237
IT'S A SMALL.

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:12.973
PROJECT IN ITS CONSTRUCTION WORK

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.608
IN AT THE END OF THAT PROJECT

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:16.210
THEN OF COURSE PEOPLE HAVE TO GO

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:17.711
INTO THE CONSTRUCTION WILL.

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:19.180
WHICH IS ALWAYS CYCLICAL TO

01:35:19.246 --> 01:35:21.048
BEGIN WITH PARTICULARLY IN LOW

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:23.184
INCOME COMMUNITIES SO I HAVE I

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.452
HAVE QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:25.419
THAT'S REALLY.

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:28.089
AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY THINK IT IS.

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:29.890
BUT WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:32.393
MAKE THEM DO THAT.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:35.096
WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO EVEN

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:37.465
REQUIRE THEM TO CONSIDER.

01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:39.100
GEO ONE FIFTIES OKAY BUT SHOULD

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:40.835
THEY HAVE BACK TO OVERSIGHT

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:43.037
SHOULDN'T YOU GUYS HAVE GREATER

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:44.672
OVERSIGHT OVER.

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:46.373
A ENTITY AYE AYE LET ME TELL YOU

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.141
ONLY REASON I ASK QUESTIONS

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:49.477
BECAUSE I'M OFFER COMPETITION.

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:51.779
BUT I WORK FOR A MAJOR UTILITY

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.414
TURN ENERGY CRISIS AND I DON'T

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:55.583
SEECCA'S ANY DIFFERENT FROM

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:57.518
ENRON THEIR THIRD PARK PARTY

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:59.487
REMARKETER OF POWER.

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:04.225

THAT COM OUR CUSTOMER AND NOW MY

01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:18.139
CCA GOES BACK GROW WHAT WE OUT

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:19.173
WE BOUGHT IT WE HAVE UTILITY

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.875
BUYING POWER ONCE AGAIN ON THE

SOMEPLACE HERE.

01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:43.898
WE DID TWO STUDIES ONE WAS AN

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:46.300
EXAMINATION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:48.202
IN THE ELECTRICITY MARKETS HERE

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:50.471
IN CALIFORNIA WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:52.173
THESE THIRD PARTY START TO

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:54.408
PROVIDE MORE ELECTRIC SERVICE TO

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:55.342
CUSTOMERS.

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:57.244
THERE'S TECHNOLOGIES AND THERE'S

01:36:57.311 --> 01:37:00.781
BUSINESS MODELS IS DIRECT ACCESS

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:00.948
IS.

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:02.283
THE PACE --

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:05.219
ANA LENDERS IT'S THE IT'S THE

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:08.055
THE THE THE COMPETITIVE

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:10.791
COMMUNITY AGGREGATOR THE NET

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:13.127
ENERGY METERED ROOFTOP SOLAR AND

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:15.863
TO SOME EXTENT THE THE FUEL CELL

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:16.397
THE NATURAL GAS FUEL SO

01:37:16.463 --> 01:37:17.631
COMPANIES.

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:19.700
ALL HAVE ALLOWED OF VARIOUS

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:21.335
CUSTOMERS TO DEPART FROM THE

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:23.904
ELECTRIC UTILITIES IS WILL PLACE

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:27.374
FOR THE BUY THEIR ELECTRICITY --

01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:28.842
I WE LOOKED AT FOR STATE THERE

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:31.045
HAVE ACTUALLY.

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:33.847
THIRD OF GOING DOWN THIS PATH.

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:35.482
AND WHAT BECOMES CLEAR IS WERE

01:37:35.549 --> 01:37:37.451
SORT OF BETWEEN.

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.019
THE THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED

01:37:39.086 --> 01:37:41.755
UTILITY AND A FULLY DEREGULATED

01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:43.591
ELECTRICITY MARKET SO WE'RE KIND

01:37:43.657 --> 01:37:45.226
OF ON CHARTED AND POTENTIALLY

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:47.194
DANGEROUS TERRITORY.

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:49.630
YOU POINTED TO SOME OF IT --

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:51.565
THIS IS OUR SECOND REPORT AND

01:37:51.632 --> 01:37:53.033
BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED FROM

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.602
THOSE OTHER FOUR STATES IT'S

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:56.570
SUGGESTS A VARIETY OF THINGS

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:58.539
THAT WE SHOULD DO TO ACTUALLY

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:01.175
PROTECT AGAINST SOME OF THE THE

01:38:01.242 --> 01:38:02.509
DANGERS AND THE SUN CHARTED

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:03.877
TERRITORY.

01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:05.412
WE DID DISCUSS THE THERE'S

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:07.715
RESPONSIBILITY TO USE.

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:09.516
YOUR INVESTMENTS IN YOUR

01:38:09.583 --> 01:38:11.085
CONTRACTORS IN A WAY THAT

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:12.786
SUPPORTED ALL OF CALIFORNIA

01:38:12.853 --> 01:38:14.655
COMMUNITIES AS WELL THAT

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:16.323
DIVERSITY CONTRACT THERE'S

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:17.057
PROGRAM SO.

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:18.492
I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:19.426
I KNOW THAT --

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:21.395
THEY COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS IS

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:23.897
PLANNING ANOTHER HEARING SOLELY

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:24.898
ON THAT SO I DON'T WANT TO SPEND

01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:26.900
TOO MUCH TIME ON THAT MY LAST

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:28.369
QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE THE TO CC

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:30.204
AGE TO NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH.

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:33.641
PALMER USE RULES THIS IS THE

01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:37.745
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES I DON'T

01:38:37.811 --> 01:38:39.280
STRUCTURE THEY TEND TO THINK

01:38:39.346 --> 01:38:40.881
PRIMARILY ABOUT --

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:44.285
CLEAN ENERGY THE CCA IS THE

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:45.619
CLEAN THE COMBATIVE COMMITTEE

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:46.787
AGGREGATORS ORIGINALLY WERE

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.522
FORMED TO ACTUALLY GET CHEAPER

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:49.723
PRICES.

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:52.626
BUT THAT'S SORT OF THAT SORT OF

01:38:52.693 --> 01:38:54.962
BEEN LOST IN A IN A RACE TO BE

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:56.964
AS GREEN AS YOU CAN BE SO I

01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:58.432
THINK THAT THE THE THE THE GAMES

01:38:58.499 --> 01:38:59.433
A CHANGE.

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.934
I THINK THAT MOST OF THEM WHEN

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:02.503
THEY DO LEARN ABOUT TIME OF USE

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.271
OF JUST KIND OF DECIDED THAT

01:39:04.338 --> 01:39:07.274
THEY WOULD WHAT THEY WOULD STICK

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:08.442
WITH THE UTILITY.

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:09.176
OF RATES BUT THERE'S NO

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.844
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY DO THAT WE

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:11.445
COULD FIND SOME OF THEM DECIDE

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:15.582
NOT [inaudible]

01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:16.917
TO THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:20.754
I'M.

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:22.623
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THE

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.725
REFERENCES THAT EARLIER ON WHERE

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:29.563
THE QUESTIONS WERE ASKED AROUND --

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:30.798
MY COLLEAGUE --

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:33.367
SENATE RUBIO REFERENCING THE

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:34.601
NINETEEN PROGRAMS --

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.970
IT AROUND THE SAFETY ALL OF

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:38.472
BROADLY SAY SAFETY CULTURE.

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:41.308
THEN WE HAVE THE NORTH STAR --

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:43.344
ART THAT YOU REFERENCE TO REPORT

01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:44.545
THE REFERENCE.

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:46.413
SO IS LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.681
SCRIPT BY UNDERSTAND CORRECT

01:39:47.748 --> 01:39:51.518
WHAT I'VE INTERPRETING IS THAT.

01:39:51.585 --> 01:39:54.288
THE PC IS.

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.357
WORKING NOW TO TRY TO GET MORE.

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:58.826
MORE.

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:00.928
US A CONSISTENCY AND CLARITY

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:02.930
AROUND.

01:40:02.996 --> 01:40:05.799
THESE KIND OF SAFETY RULES SO

01:40:05.866 --> 01:40:08.001
THAT THEY CAN BE.

01:40:08.068 --> 01:40:10.537
IN FORCED MORE AT SO IT'S EASIER

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:13.540
TO DO THE ENFORCEMENT WE DON'T

01:40:13.607 --> 01:40:15.976
TO ENFORCEMENT OVER THEIR SAFETY

01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:18.679
PROGRAMS PER SE WHAT WE DO IS

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:21.582
ENFORCE FAILURES. TO ACTUALLY BE

01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:24.785
SAFE OKAY SO BUT WE KNOW THAT

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:27.087
THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE AND A THE

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:27.821
ORIGINAL --

01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:30.824
INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL.

01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:33.327
OF EXTERNAL --

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:34.995
OF THIRTIES WHO LOOKED AT ASSN

01:40:35.062 --> 01:40:37.197
P. GINNY SUGGESTED THAT WE START

01:40:37.264 --> 01:40:39.032
TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES RIGHT.

01:40:39.099 --> 01:40:41.068
THE PLACE WERE REALLY --

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:43.804
PROBABLY SHOWS UP MOST IS AS

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:46.273
WITH WE UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:48.342
ELEMENTS GO INTO THEIR SAFETY

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:49.109
CULTURE.

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:54.848
WE'LL SEE THAT IN THEIR RISK

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:57.184
THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD ACTUALLY

01:40:57.251 --> 01:40:59.386
REVIEWED DESIST MAKES SENSE AS

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:00.754
AN EXPENDITURE RIGHT.

01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:02.723
AND SO AGAIN IT'S HARD TO KNOW

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:04.258
SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO SEE THINGS

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:06.226
PLAY OUT OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:07.995
TO SEE IF IT ACTUALLY RESULT IN

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.496
LESS.

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:10.731
LEADING INDICATORS SO FOR

01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:12.533
EXAMPLE THE DENNIS IS PROBABLY

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:14.268
NOT THE BEST ONE BUT WHEN I WAS

01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:17.104
ON THE BOARD OF THE SACRAMENTO

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:18.439
MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT.

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:21.041
THEY ACTUALLY COUNT NEAR MISSES

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:22.309
IN THE PARKING LOT.

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:23.844
BECAUSE THAT TELLS THEM WHO IS

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:26.480
REALLY.

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:27.948
DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.817
WANT HER PEOPLE WERE DRIVING ONE

01:41:29.883 --> 01:41:32.386
OF THEIR EQUIPMENT TRUCKS TO DO.

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:34.388
THAT TELLS THEM THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:35.856
BEING THOUGHTFUL THEY HAVE OTHER

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:38.292
KIND OF LEADING INDICATORS THAT

01:41:38.358 --> 01:41:39.393
THEY LOOK AT IN THE FIELD.

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.128
SO DID YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SIMPLE

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:42.896
THINGS THAT TELL YOU WHETHER

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:45.098
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PRACTICING

01:41:45.165 --> 01:41:46.066
GOOD SAFETY.

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:47.668
THEN YOU MEASURE THE LAGGING

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:49.403
INDICATORS WAS ARE MORE CRAP AND

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:50.170
FAILURE WITH THEIR MORE

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:52.239
COLLISIONS DID YOU HAVE MORE

01:41:52.306 --> 01:41:53.540
ACCIDENTS ON THE ROAD.

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:55.709
SO YOU WANT TO HAVE A BALANCE OF

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:57.678
THOSE KINDS OF METRICS TO REALLY

01:41:57.744 --> 01:42:00.047
SEE HOW WELL THINGS WORK.

01:42:00.113 --> 01:42:02.616
AND EVEN THEN YOU MAY NOT HAVE

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:04.418
THE RIGHT SET OF METRICS TO

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:06.286
REALLY GET ON A DEAL WITH THE

01:42:06.353 --> 01:42:09.523
HIGH CONSEQUENCE BUT LOWER

01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:11.358
CURRENTS.

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:12.092
KINDS OF INITIATIVES BUT YOU

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:12.926
WANT YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO

01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:14.595
START THERE SO THE EXAMPLE THAT

01:42:14.661 --> 01:42:16.763
I USE WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE

01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:18.031
ABOUT ITSELF CO.

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:19.166
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY IMPROVED

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:21.168
THEIR OVERALL PROFITABILITY

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:23.570
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO FOCUSED ON

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:24.972
SAFETY WITHIN THE AREA?

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:26.740
THAT THEY STARTED TO ACTUALLY

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.575
NOTICE THINGS AND REPORTED BACK

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:30.110
UP THE CHAIN.

01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:32.212
THERE ENDED UP IN SAVINGS BOTH

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:34.581
IN TERMS OF INSURANCE COSTS AND

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:37.284
LOST TIME BUT ALSO PROCESS

01:42:37.351 --> 01:42:38.385
IMPROVEMENT.

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:40.087
AND SO YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:42.456
THAT KIND OF UNDERSTANDING OF

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:43.957
WHY YOU DO THINGS SO THAT PEOPLE

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:46.527
CAN THEN PICK IT APART AND SEE

01:42:46.593 --> 01:42:47.895
WHERE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS.

01:42:47.961 --> 01:42:49.162
SO THE GET EVEN BETTER AND

01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:52.299
BETTER SAY AND A RISK MANAGEMENT

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:53.901
STRATEGY OUR CONTINUOUS

01:42:53.967 --> 01:42:56.103
IMPROVEMENT CONCEPT RATHER THAN

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:58.739
COMPLIANCE WHICH IS STEADY STATE

01:42:58.805 --> 01:43:01.375
TO DO THIS AND THEN YOU SHOULD

01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:02.809
BE OKAY.

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:05.078
I DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE THE COM.

01:43:05.145 --> 01:43:07.114
PLEX CITY OF IT BUT I AM I'M

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:08.348
JUST THINKING SAY ON THE

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:11.919
WILDFIRE PART AND I APPRECIATE

01:43:11.985 --> 01:43:13.520
THE CLARIFICATION.

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:16.189
THAT WE DON'T ENFORCE.

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:19.126
THAT YOU DO A TAX OR WHY WE

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:20.594
MOURN FORCE THAT YOU THAT

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:22.729
WHATEVER PROCEDURES YOU'RE USING

01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:24.565
THAT YOU HAVE.

01:43:24.631 --> 01:43:27.801
MINIMIZE THESE RISKS --

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:29.803
HOWEVER.

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.139
AS YOU POINTED OUT SINCE.

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:33.807
SINCE THAT IS SOMETHING THEY

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:38.779
CHARGE TO RATE PAYERS --

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:40.180
AND AND I'M PARTLY THINKING

01:43:40.247 --> 01:43:43.483
ABOUT THE JUDGE RIGHT NOW WHO'S

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:47.187
BASICALLY LOOKING AT SB OPINING

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:49.590
THAT P. GENIES --

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:53.226
BOTH ATTENTION TO A DEDICATION

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:56.263
TO AND NOT ONLY THOROUGHNESS BUT

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:58.131
REALLY JUST --

01:43:58.198 --> 01:44:00.667
ACTIVITY IN RELATIONSHIP TO

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:01.969
WILDFIRE PREVENTION YOU KNOW

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:03.937
ACCORDING TO THIS JUDGE AT LEAST

01:44:04.004 --> 01:44:04.271
IN THE OLD --

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:05.973
PINING THAT I'VE READ IT READ IN

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:09.076
THE PRESS REPORTS YOU KNOW IS IN

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:10.644
HIS OPINION VERY BAD.

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:13.981
AND SO HE'S NOW ORDERING CERTAIN

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:16.950
THINGS WHICH OF COURSE.

01:44:17.017 --> 01:44:18.885
WOULD IT SEEMS TO ME HARVARD

01:44:18.952 --> 01:44:20.420
THEN END UP BEING THINGS THAT

01:44:20.487 --> 01:44:23.023
REPAIRS WOULD HAVE TO BE CHARGED.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.058
TO SO I'M WHAT I'M STARTING WITH

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:25.926
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO A

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:27.894
LOT OF DETAIL AT THIS NOW BUT

01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:28.795
THAT WITHOUT.

01:44:28.862 --> 01:44:31.632
A CLEAR PROTOCOL FOR WHAT IS

01:44:31.698 --> 01:44:33.333
ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP INSURE

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.202
GOOD.

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:36.603
SAFETY IN RELATIONSHIP TO

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:38.805
WILDFIRE PREVENTION THEN HOW IS

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:40.207
IT THAT WE CAN.

01:44:40.273 --> 01:44:43.043
JUSTIFY THEIR EXPENDITURE AND I

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:45.879
REASON AGAIN MAYBE NOT THE BEST

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:47.781
ANALOGY BUT I THINK ABOUT.

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.983
WHAT HOSPITALS HAVE PUT INTO

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:51.718
PLACE NOW SAVE WITH SURGERIES OR

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.186
WHAT THEY DON'T CARE WHAT THE

01:44:53.253 --> 01:44:54.488
SURGERY IS EVERYONE ELSETO

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:57.190
FOLLOW A VERY SIMILAR PROTOCOL?

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:58.659
WHICH HELPS IN WHICH THEY HAVE

01:44:58.725 --> 01:45:02.195
TESTED OVER TIME THAT MINIMIZES

01:45:02.262 --> 01:45:03.697
MISTAKES IN THE SURGERY

01:45:03.764 --> 01:45:05.799
REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:08.168
SURGERY AND SO.

01:45:08.235 --> 01:45:10.537
I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:11.505
TO LEARN HOW TO DO THAT WHEN

01:45:11.571 --> 01:45:13.807
NONE OF US ACTUALLY OUR WORK ON

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.208
LINE CREWS.

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:17.477
NONE OF US ACTUALLY MOVE MANAGE

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:19.913
LYING CRUZ EITHER GAS INSPECTION

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:22.582
OR OR ELECTRIC.

01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:26.753
IT THE DOWN TO THOSE BEST

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:29.456
PRACTICE MODELS RATE AND THIS IS

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:31.591
THIS IS NW TO US IS IT IS IN

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:33.360
MANY OTHER PLACES WE STUDIED A

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:35.228
VARIETY OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:36.596
OF MODELS.

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:38.665
AND AGAIN I POINTED TO THE INFO

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:40.333
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE OF

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.469
THE FAA WERE THE THE THE THE

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:45.338
ONLY CRIME AT THE FCA IS FAILURE

01:45:45.405 --> 01:45:47.040
TO REPORT.

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:48.341
AN INCIDENT.

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:49.576
THEN THEY ARE ALL EVERYBODY

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:51.812
STOPS TO TO REALLY UNDERSTAND.

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:53.613
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE ARGUMENT

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.948
AROUND WHETHER THEY SHOULD

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:58.051
GROUND THE FLEET OF SEVEN THIRTY

01:45:58.118 --> 01:45:59.686
SEVEN SO --

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:01.388
BUT WILL NORTH STAR.

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:03.490
POTENTIALLY PROVIDE I MEAN NOT

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.625
THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE AN ANSWER

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:07.127
BUT MIGHT THEY PROVIDE SOME.

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:08.328
GUIDANCE NINE YEAR SORT OF

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:11.231
ASKING ME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:12.466
EIGHT TO HER DIRECT WHAT I'M

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:13.567
GONNA HAVE IN MY POCKET OKAY ALL

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:14.101
RIGHT.

01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:15.936
HI ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS WE KNOW

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.337
THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE WE KNOW

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:19.339
THAT THERE ARE TOOLS OUT THERE

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:20.841
WERE STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND

01:46:20.907 --> 01:46:22.275
AND APPLY THEM.

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:24.878
WE WANT TO HAVE BEST PRACTICES

01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:26.680
BE JUST CAN'T GET HIM OFF THE

01:46:26.747 --> 01:46:28.048
SHELF.

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:28.615
SO THE LAST QUESTIONS GIVE

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:30.150
MAKERS COMPLETELY NOT ON THE

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:31.818
FIRE -- YOU

01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:34.154
REFERENCE THE AD CARBONIZATION

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:37.257
OF BUILDINGS AND WE'RE HOPING

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:40.160
THAT OTHER KICK OTHER COMMUNITY

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:42.763
SO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF BERKELEY.

01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:42.963
OKAY.

01:46:43.029 --> 01:46:44.664
BUT I THINK CERTAINLY GIVEN

01:46:44.731 --> 01:46:46.900
CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW WE'RE APT

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:49.503
WERE OBVIOUSLY ACCELERATING.

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:52.038
OUR EFFORT TO TRY TO REDUCE

01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:19.219
PRIORITIZE UTILITY PROPOSALS

01:54:19.285 --> 01:54:20.787

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:24.357
MANNER.

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:26.292
OF COURSE ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART

01:54:26.359 --> 01:54:28.294
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR MISSION IS

01:54:28.361 --> 01:54:30.063
TO ADVOCATE FOR COST EFFECTIVE

01:54:34.534 --> 01:54:35.468
AND HOLDING UTILITIES

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:37.537
ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW THEY OPERATE

01:54:37.604 --> 01:54:39.639
AND MANAGE THEIR FACILITIES IS

01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:41.040
PARAMOUNT.

01:54:41.107 --> 01:54:42.308
TO ENSURING SAFETY AND

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:43.910
RELIABILITY.

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:45.211
OVER THE LAST DECADE IN

01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:47.380
PARTICULARLY SINCE THE TRAGIC

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:49.148
SAN BRUNO NATURAL GAS PIPELINE

01:54:49.215 --> 01:54:50.350
EXPLOSION.

01:54:50.416 --> 01:54:52.085
WE HAVE BROADENED AND DEEPENED

01:54:52.151 --> 01:54:54.020
OUR SAFETY EXPERTISE WITH THE

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.355
SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:56.656
LEGISLATURE.

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:57.957
WE HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD

01:54:58.024 --> 01:54:59.726

DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC BE REQUIRED

01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:13.206
TO PRESSURE TEST AND WHERE

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:15.608
NECESSARY REPLACE PARTS OF ONE

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:17.010
OF THEIR MAJOR NATURAL GAS

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:18.511
TRANSMISSION LINES.

01:55:18.578 --> 01:55:19.579
WE PROVIDE A COMPELLING AN

01:55:19.646 --> 01:55:21.881
ACCURATE INFORMATION TO SHOW

01:55:21.948 --> 01:55:22.715
THAT.

01:55:22.782 --> 01:55:24.350
THEY NEEDED TO PRINT PRESSURE

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:25.918
TEST SEIZE FIND CONSISTENT WITH

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:27.720
FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:31.391
AND AND THE PC DID ADOPT THAT.

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:33.359
WE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED

01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:34.594
FOR ENHANCED CUSTOMER

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:36.696
PROTECTIONS ACROSS ENERGY AND

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:38.598
WATER SERVICES THEY WOULD BE IN

01:55:38.665 --> 01:55:40.600
PLACE ANY AFTER ANY NATURAL

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:42.669
DISASTER MAKING IT EASIER FOR

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:43.903
LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS IN

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.672
PARTICULAR. TO CONTINUE TO

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:47.674
RECEIVE DISCOUNTED RATES AS WELL

01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:49.275
AS A SPENDING VARIOUS FEES AND

01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:50.777
DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS SO THAT

01:55:50.843 --> 01:55:53.780
PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR SERVICE UP

01:55:53.846 --> 01:55:54.080
AND RUNNING.

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:54.781
MORE QUICKLY.

01:55:54.847 --> 01:56:00.620
YOU PROCEDURES. TO IMPLEMENT SB

01:56:00.687 --> 01:56:02.188
NINE A ONE AND THERE WERE

01:56:02.255 --> 01:56:04.257
FOCUSED OUR REVIEW ON THE

01:56:04.324 --> 01:56:06.359
UTILITIES COMPLIANCE WITH SB

01:56:06.426 --> 01:56:10.730
WHAT NINE A ONE REQUIREMENTS.

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:12.465
OUR THIRD POLICY GOAL OF COURSE

01:56:12.532 --> 01:56:14.400
IS TO HELP ADVANCE THE STATE'S

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:17.170
CLIMATE GOALS MOST EFFECTIVELY.

01:56:17.236 --> 01:56:18.705
HERE WE SEE.

01:56:18.771 --> 01:56:22.775
A CRITICAL. TO CREATE POLICIES

01:56:22.842 --> 01:56:24.744
THAT WILL ACHIEVE A 100%

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:27.080
RENEWABLES BUT IN A WAY THAT'S

01:56:27.146 --> 01:56:28.748
COST EFFECTIVE SO THAT THESE.

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.683
THESE POLICIES CAN ALSO BE

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.051
EXPORTABLE TO OTHER

01:56:32.118 --> 01:56:33.886
JURISDICTIONS THAT MAY NOT BE

01:56:33.953 --> 01:56:35.988
WILLING TO PAY QUITE AS MUCH.

01:56:36.055 --> 01:56:37.557
SO OF COURSE CALIFORNIA'S ONLY

01:56:37.623 --> 01:56:39.292
RESPONSE OF FOR ABOUT 1% OF THE

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:42.395
WORLD'S GHG EMISSIONS.

01:56:42.462 --> 01:56:43.663
SO WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:45.064
PROGRAMS CAN BE READILY

01:56:45.131 --> 01:56:48.634
EXPORTABLE.

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:50.036
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THAT WE

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:51.637
ADVOCATED FOR THE UTILITY

01:56:51.704 --> 01:56:53.740
TRANSPORTATION LIKED VACATION

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:55.608
PROGRAMS. TO ENABLE INCREASED

01:56:55.675 --> 01:56:57.443
DEPLOYMENT OF ELECTRIC.

01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:59.645
VEHICLES WHILE MAXIMIZING THE

01:56:59.712 --> 01:57:01.748
BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS AND IN

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:03.816
PARTICULAR WE PRIORITIZE

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:05.685
TRANSPORTATION LIKE VACATION IN

01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:07.420
DISADVANTAGE IN LOW INCOME

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:09.322
COMMUNITIES.

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:10.623
SEC S. TO SEPARATE SITTING

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:11.758
COURAGE ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:57:11.824 --> 01:57:13.993
CHARGING AT TIMES THAT WOULD

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.495
ENHANCE GRIN RELIABILITY.

01:57:15.561 --> 01:57:16.929
AND ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE

01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:18.931
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT

01:57:18.998 --> 01:57:20.733
MAXIMIZE LESSONS LEARNED AND

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.068
PUBLIC BENEFIT.

01:57:22.135 --> 01:57:24.704
AND SO WHAT THE PC ADOPTED WAS A

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.339
BUDGET THEY REDUCE THE UTILITY'S

01:57:26.406 --> 01:57:28.274
REQUEST BY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:29.842
ONE MILLION DOLLARS BUT STILL

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:31.444
ACHIEVED AT THE TRANSPORTATION

01:57:31.511 --> 01:57:32.845
ELECTRIFICATION.

01:57:32.912 --> 01:57:35.515
DEPLOYMENT THAT WAS MORE IS

01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:36.916
DESIRED.

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:37.483
SO WITH THAT.

ONE SURE BE HAPPY TO SO ANOTHER

01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:46.953
ONE IS IN THE PRECEDING WHERE

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:49.188
WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:51.891
INTEGRATE MORE IT DE OURS ON TO

01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:53.192
THE GRID --

01:58:53.259 --> 01:58:56.295
THERE WE ARE LOOKING BOTH AT

01:58:56.362 --> 01:59:00.166
WHERE WHERE CAN THOSE --

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:02.134
IN IT DISTRIBUTED ENERGY

01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:04.103
RESOURCES BE --

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:06.672
BEST INTEGRATED WITH THE GRID TO

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:10.376
MAXIMIZE BENEFIT AS WELL AS WHAT

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:11.844
ARE THE WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE --

01:59:11.911 --> 01:59:17.984
BEST MIX OF RESOURCES TO TO A

01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:20.620
100% BUT THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A

01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:23.256
WAY THAT IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE --

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:24.991
AND WE AS PART OF THAT

01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:26.325
PROCEEDING WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

01:59:26.392 --> 01:59:28.394
HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT

01:59:28.461 --> 01:59:29.795
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE

01:59:29.862 --> 01:59:31.464
ARE SERVED AND I DON'T KNOW I'VE

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:33.065
GOT THEM COURSE MY DEPUTY FOR

01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:35.468
ENERGY HERE SO IF LINDA WANTS TO

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:38.804
ADD ANYTHING [inaudible] TO THAT.

01:59:38.871 --> 01:59:41.173

ACTUALLY PROPOSED IT WAS ADOPTED

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:49.582
AND FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING

01:59:49.649 --> 01:59:52.051
WHERE -- A

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:53.252
PROCESSOR FRAME IT FOR DID

01:59:53.319 --> 01:59:54.654
IDENTIFY WHERE DISTRIBUTED

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.055
ENERGY RESOURCES SHOULD BEST BE

01:59:56.122 --> 01:59:59.759
PLACED ON THE SYSTEM TWO AND A

01:59:59.825 --> 02:00:01.494
TO ENSURE OUR TO SUPPORT

02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:04.764

OR SPPORT THE STATE'S BUDGET

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:09.235
SHE REDUCTION GOALS SO THAT WAS

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:10.603
A A MASSIVE PROJECT FRANKLY

02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:12.038
CAUGHT TRYING TO COME UP WITH A

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:13.339
FAIR PROCESS.

02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:14.974
AS WELL AS A TRANSPARENT PROCESS

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:16.976
BECAUSE AS YOU WELL KNOW OF

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:18.411
THERE ARE A LOT OF NEW PLAYERS

02:00:18.477 --> 02:00:20.246
IN THE DISPUTE ENERGY RESOURCE

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:21.681
WORLD -- AND

02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:22.715
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE

02:00:22.782 --> 02:00:24.917
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.652
DEVELOP THE PROJECTS SO WE'RE

02:00:26.719 --> 02:00:27.753
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:28.654
A FAIR.

02:00:28.721 --> 02:00:30.356
PLAYING FIELD FOR EVERYBODY AND

INFORMATION THEY NEED AS WELL AS

02:00:35.328 --> 02:00:37.763
WE DO.

SENATE SKINNER SENATOR RUBIO.

02:00:40.366 --> 02:00:42.335
SINCE HERTZBERG SENATOR DODD.

02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:44.637
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:44.937
[inaudible]

02:00:45.004 --> 02:00:46.973
BECAUSE A I'M NEW TO THE

02:00:47.039 --> 02:00:47.607
COMMITTEE ND AND LEARNING SO

02:00:47.673 --> 02:00:49.508
PREFIGURE PART I WAS JUST TRYING

02:00:49.575 --> 02:00:50.776
TO FIGURE OUT --

02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:53.145
A COUPLE THINGS THE FIRST WAS A

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:55.481
YOUR YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE

02:00:55.548 --> 02:00:58.851
INDEPENDENT BUT YOU ARE OF THE

DEPARTMENT OF THE CPUC IS THAT

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:02.121
CORRECT.

02:01:02.188 --> 02:01:03.489
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY A DEPARTMENT

02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:04.657
IT IS AN INTERESTING

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:06.192
RELATIONSHIP --

02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:09.328
WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE AT

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:11.330
THE PC SO WHERE PHYSICALLY

02:01:11.397 --> 02:01:13.299
LOCATED AT THE P. C. AND WE

02:01:13.366 --> 02:01:14.934
SHARE CERTAIN RESOURCES WITH

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:17.036
THEM -- BUT

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:18.371
AT THE SAME TIME.

02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:20.106
OVER TME THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:01:20.172 --> 02:01:22.375
HAS CREATED AND STRENGTHEN OUR

02:01:22.441 --> 02:01:24.877
INDEPENDENCE SO THAT WE CAN

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:27.713
SPECIFICALLY REPRESENT RATE

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:28.881
PAYERS IN.

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:33.085
C. P. PROCEEDINGS AND AND OTHER

02:01:33.152 --> 02:01:34.920
FOR SINGLE MINDED MISSION WHICH

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:36.922
IS WHICH I MENTIONED EARLIER TO

02:01:36.989 --> 02:01:38.224
TO ACHIEVE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:39.759
RATES FOR CUSTOMERS CONSISTENT

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:41.193
WITH SAFETY RELIABILITY IN THE

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.295
STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:45.865
WITHOUT ON THE WEEK THAT IS OUR

02:01:45.931 --> 02:01:47.299
MISSION AND THAT SEPARATE AND

02:01:47.366 --> 02:01:49.068
DISTINCT FROM WHAT WHAT THE PC

02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:50.002
DOES [inaudible]

02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:52.204
AND THEN.

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:53.305
SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILD

02:01:53.372 --> 02:01:54.440
FIRES YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:55.875
TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE AND

02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:57.543
REACTIVE AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:58.744
MORE IN A REACTIVE.

02:01:58.811 --> 02:02:00.813
MODE AND AND I USE THE CITY OF

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:01.914
ANAHEIM IS AN EXAMPLE THEY'VE

02:02:01.981 --> 02:02:03.449
SORT OF BEEN PROACTIVE IN

02:02:03.516 --> 02:02:05.718
WORKING ON REDUCING THE ABILITY

02:02:05.785 --> 02:02:08.654
OF SPARKS TO BECAUSE WILD FIRES

02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:10.890
IN THEIR AREAS ARE CANYON TO

02:02:10.956 --> 02:02:13.259
CENTER AND SO I'M JUST.

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:14.627
SORT OF CURIOUS --

02:02:14.694 --> 02:02:17.363
YOU SAVE THREE BILLION LAST YEAR.

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:18.564
BUT A LITTLE BIT OF A RATE

02:02:18.631 --> 02:02:20.933
INCREASE WOULD HAVE SAVED A LOT

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.236
MORE AND PROPERTY LOSS I DON'T

02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:24.837
KNOW WHAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WE'RE

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:26.338
TALKING WHAT THIRTY TEN TIMES

02:02:26.405 --> 02:02:27.073
MORE.

02:02:27.139 --> 02:02:27.740
AND AND SO I'M JUST KINDA

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:29.942
CURIOUS WORD WORDS THE BALANCE

02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:32.545
OF OF STAVING.

02:02:32.611 --> 02:02:33.879
TAX IF YOU KNOW RATE PAYERS

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:35.448
SOMETHING BUT ALSO WORKING ON

02:02:35.514 --> 02:02:36.982
THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF GETTING

02:02:37.049 --> 02:02:38.017
PROACTIVE.

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:40.186
YES WE WE ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOR

02:02:40.252 --> 02:02:42.388
OF BEING PROACTIVE I I THINK

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:45.925
THAT INVESTING IN IMPROVING THAT

02:02:45.991 --> 02:02:48.394
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:50.963
TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE FIRES IS

02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:52.698
PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST

02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:54.533
IMPORTANT WAYS TO SAVE NOT ONLY

02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.936
LIVES BUT BUT CUSTOMERS.

02:02:57.002 --> 02:02:59.638
MONEY IN THE IN THE LONG RUN SO --

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:02.641
SO YEAH I FEEL I FEEL STRONGLY

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:04.643
ON THAT THAT THAT THAT IS A

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:06.145
PRIORITY AND THAT'S CONSISTENT

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:07.446
WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:08.814
WE HAVE.

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:10.282
ADVOCATED IN A NUMBER OF

02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:13.419
PROCEEDING SAFETY INVESTMENTS

02:03:13.486 --> 02:03:16.288
EVEN IF THEY HAVE A PRICE TAG

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:17.590
ATTACHED TO THEM --

02:03:17.656 --> 02:03:19.458
SO WHAT WE WHAT WE TRY TO DO WE

02:03:19.525 --> 02:03:21.360
WERE ACTUALLY INSTRUMENTAL IN

02:03:21.427 --> 02:03:23.929
SETTING UP A PROCESS WHERE THE

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:26.665
THE SAFETY RISKS WERE TAKEN OUT

02:03:26.732 --> 02:03:28.868
OF THE GENERAL RATE CASE AND

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:30.302
LOOKED AT UP FRONT.

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:32.037
SO YOU WEREN'T MODELING THE THE

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:33.806
SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE FINANCIAL

02:03:33.873 --> 02:03:35.241
ISSUES QUITE AS MUCH SO YOU'RE

02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:36.876
LOOKING AT THE SAFETY ISSUES IN

02:03:36.942 --> 02:03:37.977
DECIDING.

02:03:38.043 --> 02:03:39.845
IN A TRANSPARENT WAY WHAT DOES

02:03:39.912 --> 02:03:42.114
NEED TO BE PRIORITIZED IN TERMS

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:44.450
OF OF SAFETY RISKS AND THEN AND

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:46.552
THEN AND THEY GENERATE CASE WE

02:03:46.619 --> 02:03:47.186
TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH IT SHOULD

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:47.686
COST.

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:50.990
SO WE WE WOULD NOT OPPOSE --

02:03:51.056 --> 02:03:53.325
A SAFETY INVESTMENT THAT WAS WAS

02:03:53.392 --> 02:03:55.427
A PRIORITY FOR THE UTILITY --

02:03:55.494 --> 02:03:57.830
WHAT WE MIGHT DO IS IS IF THEY

02:03:57.897 --> 02:04:00.032
WERE COMING IN AT? THREE TO FIVE

02:04:00.099 --> 02:04:01.634
TIMES WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW OTHER

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:03.002
UTILITIES WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE

02:04:03.068 --> 02:04:05.304
MIGHT ASK WHY IS THIS GOING TO

02:04:05.371 --> 02:04:06.372
COST YOU SO MUCH IN YOUR

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:07.506
TERRITORY VERSUS WHAT IT'S

02:04:07.573 --> 02:04:09.241
COSTING AND IN ANOTHER PART OF

02:04:09.308 --> 02:04:10.342
THE STATE --

02:04:10.409 --> 02:04:11.377
AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY COULD

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:13.279
JUSTIFY MAYBE THE TRAIN IS AT

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:14.313
DIFFERENT BUT THOSE ARE THE

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:15.848
KINDS OF QUESTIONS WE WOULD ASK

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:17.449
NOT YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT THE BUT

02:04:17.516 --> 02:04:19.852
IN BUT BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:20.986
IS APPROPRIATE MOUNT.

02:04:21.053 --> 02:04:23.088
THAT THAT SHOULD COST YEAH AND

02:04:23.155 --> 02:04:24.924
I'M FINDING PERHAPS THAT IT COST

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:27.526
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A MILE.

02:04:27.593 --> 02:04:30.830
TO UNDERGROUND UTILITY LINES

02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:35.234
WHICH IS NOT LOST LIVES AND

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:36.836
PROPERTY SO I'M JUST CURIOUS

02:04:36.902 --> 02:04:37.736
MISTER PICKER SAID HEY WE'RE

02:04:37.803 --> 02:04:40.306
GONNA KEEP TELEPHONE POLES

02:04:40.372 --> 02:04:40.906
BECAUSE WE NEED TO PUT UP FIVE

02:04:40.973 --> 02:04:41.473
G..

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:44.743
BUT CAN'T WE UNDERGROUND THE

02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:45.377
ELECTRICITY --

02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:47.279
TO PREVENT SPARKS IN THE WINDY

02:04:47.346 --> 02:04:48.814
CONDITIONS AND THEN HAVE LIGHT

02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:50.649
POLES WITH THE FIVE G. EIGHT UP

02:04:50.716 --> 02:04:55.120
ON THERE AS AS AS AS AN OPTION.

02:04:55.187 --> 02:04:56.155
I'VE GOT A MEETING THAT'S WHAT

02:04:56.222 --> 02:04:57.223
I'M THINKING SO MAYBE YEAH

02:04:57.289 --> 02:04:58.657
RESPOND TO HIS ANSWER HE YEAH

02:04:58.724 --> 02:04:59.558
WELL THEY YEAH IT'S AN

02:04:59.625 --> 02:05:01.060
INTERESTING POINT YEAH I THINK

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.962
YOU CERTAINLY CAN UNDERGROUND

02:05:03.028 --> 02:05:04.797
UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND THEN

02:05:04.864 --> 02:05:06.131
HAVE.

02:05:06.198 --> 02:05:09.335
HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FOUR

02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:10.069
FOUR FIVE G. I MEAN CERTAINLY

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:12.004
CURRENTLY WITH WITH FOUR G. YOU

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:14.373
CAN HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.242
STILL HAVE UTILITIES UNDERGROUND

02:05:16.308 --> 02:05:17.643
ANYWHERE WHERE I LIVE I'M

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:19.311
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE.

02:05:19.378 --> 02:05:21.046
EVERYTHING WAS UNDERGROUND IN

02:05:21.113 --> 02:05:23.048
TWENTY YEARS AGO WHERE I LIVE SO --

02:05:23.115 --> 02:05:25.251
VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT BUT I

02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:26.518
STILL FOR THE MOST BURKE ITSELF

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:28.454
CELL COVERAGE SO --

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:29.822
YEAH I THINK I THINK IT IS

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:32.324
POSSIBLE TO DO BOTH IT IS

02:05:32.391 --> 02:05:35.294
EXPENSIVE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

02:05:35.361 --> 02:05:36.629
CHEAP.

02:05:36.695 --> 02:05:38.998
CENTER DOT IF YOU IF YOU'RE NOT

02:05:39.064 --> 02:05:42.434
FINISHED THE IDEA BEHIND FOR

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:44.737
ASIAN.

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:46.171
FIVE IT IS IT IS NOT NOT AN

02:05:46.238 --> 02:05:47.773
EXPERT HERE ON ON ON RATES AND

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:48.507
EVERYTHING BUT I'VE LEARNED AN

02:05:48.574 --> 02:05:49.241
AWFUL LOT THE LAST SIXTEEN

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:49.475
MONTHS.

02:05:49.541 --> 02:05:50.643
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA GET

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:51.777
RESILIENCY AND HAVE THE

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:54.747
UTILITIES PARTICULARLY PGD.

02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:56.181
TRIM ALL THE TREES AT IT NEEDS

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:57.917
TRIMMED IN ORDER TO GET IN

02:05:57.983 --> 02:06:00.719
COMPLIANCE TO PROVIDE SAFETY.

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:03.555
THE IDEA THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT

02:06:03.622 --> 02:06:06.025
WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH ALL THESE

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:06.325
RIDICULOUS.

02:06:06.392 --> 02:06:08.460
I MEAN.

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:12.331
THERE IT IT'S IT'S LIKE. EIGHT

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:14.033
TO FIFTEEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:15.701
THAN HANGING ALLIANCE.

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.236
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M HEARING IS

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:18.804
IS THESE NEW.

02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:20.039
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE TOUGH

02:06:20.105 --> 02:06:21.707
LONG COATED LINES WITH.

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:23.142
MOVING TOWARDS THAT IN THE

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:24.410
FUTURE IS PROBABLY MORE COST

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:27.379
EFFECTIVE. FOR RATEPAYERS THAN

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:29.949
TO GO THROUGH YOU KNOW ALL THESE

02:06:30.015 --> 02:06:32.451
WERE ALL AREAS AND HE POWER

02:06:32.518 --> 02:06:33.719
LIGHT AND BE NOT POWER LIGHTS

02:06:33.786 --> 02:06:35.354
BUT POLLS.

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:37.823
AND AND THEN ALSO --

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.525
YOU KNOW BURY THE ELECTRICAL I'M

02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:41.026
I'M I'M JUST SAYING.

02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:42.795
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC I

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:46.632
THINK THAT THE RATE PAYERS THEN.

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:47.199
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:48.534
APPROVE IT.

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:51.637
DURING SB NINE OH ONE TURN --

02:06:51.704 --> 02:06:53.505
THE REPAIR ADVOCATES FOR AG IN

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:56.375
BUSINESS AND THE MANUFACTURERS.

02:06:56.442 --> 02:06:59.011
THEY ALL OPPOSE.

02:06:59.078 --> 02:07:00.179
NINE OH ONE WHICH WOULD HAVE

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:02.748
MADE IT BETTER. FOR ALL THEIR

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:04.350
RATE PAYERS.

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:06.018
ARE YOU IN THE LONG RUN TO TAKE

02:07:06.085 --> 02:07:07.286
BUT TO TAKE.

02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:08.887
YOUR THE COST OVER ABOVE WHAT P.

02:07:08.954 --> 02:07:10.222
JEANNIE COULD PAY IN THE IN THAT

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.824
PARTICULAR CASE.

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:14.727
AND THEN MOVE IT OFF ON A TWENTY

02:07:14.793 --> 02:07:16.161
YEAR BOND LET'S SAY.

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:18.397
IT JUST TO DEAL TO TO ME.

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:21.300
IT JUST SHOWED ME HOW VERY VERY

02:07:21.367 --> 02:07:23.102
DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE. TO GET

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:25.804
ANYTHING THROUGH THE RATE CASE--

02:07:25.871 --> 02:07:28.674
YOU KNOW DID TO DO THIS --

02:07:28.741 --> 02:07:30.209
IF FOR STRUCTURE.

02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:33.312
ENHANCEMENT OTHER THAN WHAT WAS.

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:35.547
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.149
I'M NOT GONNA WHAT YOU THINK LIZ

02:07:37.216 --> 02:07:38.217
BUT WHAT IT DOES TO BE CLEAR SO

02:07:38.283 --> 02:07:40.619
I'M NOT NECESSARILY ADVOCATING

02:07:40.686 --> 02:07:42.054
FOR A FOR UNDERGROUND --

02:07:42.121 --> 02:07:43.088
EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW I'M JUST%

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:44.690
TRYING TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:46.992
TO IT TO THE QUESTION --

02:07:47.059 --> 02:07:49.895
BUT YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK

02:07:49.962 --> 02:07:51.063
CERTAINLY.

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:54.133
WE WANT TO ACHIEVE A SAFE RESULT

02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:57.236
IN IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

02:07:57.302 --> 02:07:58.003
MANNER [inaudible]

02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:59.338
POSSIBLE.

02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:00.239
BUT WE GOT TO BE REALISTIC AND

02:08:00.305 --> 02:08:02.508
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE RATE BASE.

02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:04.810
IS GOING TO WANT TO PAY FOR YES

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:06.278
YES WILL YOU WON'T GET ANY

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:08.080
ARGUMENT FROM US ON THAT WE ARE

02:08:08.147 --> 02:08:09.915

PAY FOR IT AND IS HAVING SUCH A

02:08:28.267 --> 02:08:29.835
DIFFICULT TIME.

02:08:29.902 --> 02:08:33.772

DOLLARS.

02:10:57.015 --> 02:10:58.817
IT SHOULD NOT BE PASSED ALONG TO

02:10:58.884 --> 02:11:00.152
IT TO RATE PAYERS AND IT DOESN'T

02:11:00.219 --> 02:11:01.920

GONNA LET LINDA JUMP IN HERE.

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:26.445
ANSWER THAT PART.

02:11:26.511 --> 02:11:28.447
ON THE GAS AND ELECTRIC SIDE WE

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:31.950
HAVE ACTUALLY IN OUR PLEADINGS --

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:48.133
SHOULD BE SEPARATE WHAT WE CALL

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:50.602
MEMORANDUM ACCOUNTS OR TRACKING

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:53.305

THINK YOU KNOW THIS THERE BEEN

02:11:57.509 --> 02:11:59.244
ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS.

02:11:59.311 --> 02:12:01.079
THAT WERE NISH INITIATED TO TRY

02:12:01.146 --> 02:12:02.414

SHOULD.

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:17.329
OF THE UTILITY BE FOUND AT FAULT

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:18.463
THE WILL KNOW WHAT BECAUSE

02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:20.766
SHOULD REVERT BACK TO THE

02:12:20.832 --> 02:12:21.533
UTILITY NOT SURE HOLD AND

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.234
REPAIRS.

02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:23.802
GOTCHA AND DO YOU THINK THAT

02:12:23.869 --> 02:12:24.836
THIS.

02:12:24.903 --> 02:12:26.705
IS THIS LINE THOUGH RELATED TO A

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:29.174

THERE HAS TO BE SORT OF

02:12:34.212 --> 02:12:37.182
INDEPENDENTLY.

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:39.217
ADOPTED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:12:39.284 --> 02:12:41.086
COMMISSION FOR THIS BECAUSE IT

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:42.921
pHAPPENING INTO WITH LINE I THINK

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:44.456
IT'S LINE.

02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:45.390
ONE THOUSAND ANOTHER COMBAT

02:12:45.457 --> 02:12:46.892
BECAUSE THE WHEN THEY THEY'RE

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:48.393
REPAIRING TO THIRTY FIVE VERY

02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:49.328
EXPEDITIOUSLY NOW IT'S

02:12:49.394 --> 02:12:50.529
INTERESTING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:52.297
THE PC CALLS AND STARTS ASKING

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:53.332
WHAT YOU'RE DOING AFTER A YEAR

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:55.667
OF DOING NOTHING.

02:12:55.734 --> 02:12:57.903
BUT BUT YEAH WELL I I JUST WANT

02:12:57.969 --> 02:12:59.071
TO SEE IS REPEAT THIS IN THE

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:01.606
NEXT WINTER SEASON IF THEY'RE

02:13:01.673 --> 02:13:03.041
OFFLINE AGAIN --

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:05.010
SO IS THERE HOW DID THESE HOW TO

02:13:05.077 --> 02:13:08.680
THE THAT MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:10.716
THAT TRACKING OR THAT A THAT.

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:13.719
CASH ACCOUNTING. TO MY IN MY

02:13:13.785 --> 02:13:15.487
EXPERIENCE USUALLY A PARTY HAS

02:13:15.554 --> 02:13:17.222
TO REQUEST A CONTINENT SOMETHING

02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:18.657
THAT IS JUST DONE.

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:19.991
SOMETIMES THE TOADIES WILL

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:21.993
REQUESTED IF IT IF IT'S IN THEIR

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:23.328
FAVOR FRANKLY --

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:27.799
REQUEST A MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT --

02:13:27.866 --> 02:13:29.368
IF WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:31.269
PROTECT REPAIRS AND POTENTIALLY

02:13:31.336 --> 02:13:33.305
SHIELD THEM FROM THOSE COSTS AT

02:13:33.372 --> 02:13:34.339
THE UTILITIES FOUND AT FAULT IS

02:13:34.406 --> 02:13:34.973
IS IS THAT SOME OF YOU GUYS ARE

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:40.112
WILLING TO CONSIDER ON TO THIRTY

OKAY -- AND

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:42.614
AND THEN JUST THE FINAL QUESTION

02:13:42.681 --> 02:13:43.382
THERE WOULD BE CHIU TO JUST IN

02:13:43.448 --> 02:13:45.517
GENERAL WITH OUR PIPELINE SYSTEM

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:46.551
I KNOW WE'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED

SEEING A LOT OF THESE KINDS OF

02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:54.326
LINES OF THEY CAN'T SENSE

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:55.460
REMOTELY.

02:13:55.527 --> 02:13:56.962

TRANSMISSIONS LINES I BELIEVE.

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:12.411
YEAH WHICH LINE SIXTEEN HUNDRED

02:14:12.477 --> 02:14:12.911
THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT

02:14:12.978 --> 02:14:13.512
REASONING BUT JUST.

EXPENDITURES SAY ON REPAIRS.

02:14:33.865 --> 02:14:36.101
MAINTENANCE LIKE DEPRECIATION

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:55.020
UPGRADE --

02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:56.788
WE WOULD WE WOULD ASK FOR THAT

02:14:56.855 --> 02:14:58.290
KIND OF INFORMATION AND WE WOULD

02:14:58.356 --> 02:15:00.692
GET THE DATA THA WE NEED TO TO

02:15:00.759 --> 02:15:03.094
EVALUATE THAT WE HAVE FOUND IN A

02:15:03.161 --> 02:15:04.529
NUMBER OF INSTANCES THAT.

02:15:04.596 --> 02:15:06.298
RECORD KEEPING ISN'T WHAT IT

02:15:06.364 --> 02:15:07.432
SHOULD BE --

02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:08.600
YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:10.202
CASE IN SAN BRUNO WHAT WERE SEEN

02:15:10.268 --> 02:15:11.403
IT ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE AS

02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:13.672
WELL AND AND YOU KNOW IF YOU

DON'T HAVE GOOD RECORDS ABOUT

02:15:15.807 --> 02:15:17.042
AND THEN EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE

02:15:17.108 --> 02:15:18.009
GOTTEN THE GROUND.

02:15:18.076 --> 02:15:19.978
IT'S VERY HARD TO TO HAVE A LOT

02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:21.947
OF CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE SAFETY

02:15:22.013 --> 02:15:23.281
FRANKLY SO BUT IT' ON A REAL

02:15:23.348 --> 02:15:24.883
IT'S REALLY ON A CASE BY CASE

02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:25.984
BASIS WHAT I'M HERE I SAY LIKE

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:27.586

THAT'S RIGHT AND AND THEN YOU.

02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:30.255
TRY TO SOLICIT INFORMATION BUT

02:15:30.322 --> 02:15:31.590
THERE'S NOT REALLY A PROACTIVE

02:15:31.656 --> 02:15:33.792
PROCESS SAVE MAPPING THE ENTIRE

02:15:33.859 --> 02:15:36.228
NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION SYSTEM

02:15:36.294 --> 02:15:37.562
IN CALIFORNIA IN THE AGE OF IT --

02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:39.431
THAT DOESN'T EXIST NOT THAT I

02:15:39.498 --> 02:15:43.034
KNOW OF NOT THAT SPECIFIC EFFORT

02:15:43.101 --> 02:15:44.703
BUT THROUGH OF VARIOUS

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:46.638
RESEMBLANCE REVIEWS THAT WERE

02:15:46.705 --> 02:15:47.205
THE COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY

02:15:47.272 --> 02:15:48.306

02:16:01.386 --> 02:16:03.588
IF YOU IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO A

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:05.590
MASS THAT AND PUT SOME KIND OF

02:16:05.657 --> 02:16:07.459
COMPENDIUM TOGETHER I KNOW MY

02:16:07.526 --> 02:16:09.160
