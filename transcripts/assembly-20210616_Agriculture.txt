ASSEMBLY AGRICULTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT. FIVE FOUR SEVEN TODAY I WANT TO THANK GOD. MY CO AUTHOR REMEMBER YOUR COMMITTEE MS AGUIAR-CURRY FOR HER SUPPORT ON THIS BILL- IN SHORT THIS BILL WOULD GIVE CALIFORNIA A WORLD CLASS VETERINARY EMERGENCY TEAM TO HELP THE STATE PREPARE FOR DISASTERS AND RESPOND TO THEM. SAVING THE LIVES OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND LIVESTOCK IS A WORTHY MISSION IN AND OF ITSELF. BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST THAT. FIRST RESPONDERS KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH ANIMALS ARE LESS LIKELY TO EVACUATE IN A DISASTER. UNLESS THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR ANIMALS WILL BE SAFE. THIS PUTS THE RESIDENTS IN GREAT DANGER. AND IT MAKES THE JOB OF FIRST RESPONDERS TOUGHER AS PEOPLE. REMAIN BEHIND FIRE LINES. THAT OTHERWISE IN HARM'S WAY. THE STATE'S PROGRAM FOR- EVACUATING AND CARING FOR ANIMALS. IN DISASTERS IS KNOWN AS CARES AND HAS. STRUGGLED FOR AT LEAST THE LAST DECADE AT TIMES IT HAS SIMPLY BEEN OVERWHELMED. TO THEIR CREDIT THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AG. HAVE ADDED MORE RESOURCES AND FOCUS TO THE PROGRAM BUT GAPS STILL REMAIN. TWICE IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS HAD TO CALL ON A VETERINARY EMERGENCY TEAM. FROM TEXAS A AND M. UNIVERSITY TO HELP CARE FOR OUR ANIMALS. WE WERE LUCKY TO HAVE THEIR AID. BUT CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD FIELD ITS OWN MOBILE VETERINARY TEAM CAPABLE OF RESPONDING ANYWHERE IN OUR STATE. THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE IS KNOWN AND RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE TO HOST. SUCH A VETERINARY EMERGENCY TEAM DURING HIS THE DISASTERS THIS TEAM WOULD ROLL OUT WITH THE MOBILE CLINIC STAFFED BY VETERINARIANS AND STUDENTS TO HELP LCAL AGENCIES THAT REQUEST ASSISTANCE. THE TEAM WOULD PROVIDE CARE AND MANAGE THE MANY VOLUNTEER VETERINARIANS AND OTHERS WHO ARE EAGER TO HELP DURING THESE DISASTERS. THEIR WORK WOULD BE COORDINATED THROUGH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CDFA AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO ENSURE THAT THE LINES OF AUTHORITY ARE CLEAR. BETWEEN DISASTERS THE PROGRAM WOULD CONDUCT RESEARCH AND TRAINING BOTH THE FUTURE VETS. AND VOLUNTEERS AROUND THE STATE THE PROGRAM WOULD ALSO BE A BOON TO THE SCHOOLS EXISTING SHELTER MEDICINE PROGRAM AND WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO CURRICULUM FOCUSED ON EMERGENCY MEDICINE. MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE AS WE HAVE SEEN CALIFORNIA IS PRONE TO DISASTERS. THE RECENT WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC AND ARE GETTING WORSE. THE FLOODS AND EARTHQUAKES ARE ALSO UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR FUTURE WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREPARE. THIS PROGRAM WOULD PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THAT PREPARATION AND OUR EVENTUAL RESPONSE. AM I RESPECTFULLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. WITH ME ON THAT TELECONFERENCE LINES ARE CRISPY THE BALBOA OF THAT CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND DR GRANT MILLER VETERINARIAN. AND LEADER IN THE FIELD AT THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICINE ASSOCIATION. AND THANK YOU SENATOR- SHOULD THE INTRO- OPERATOR IF. WE CAN CONNECT. OUR TWO WITNESSES- DENTISTS FIND SUPPORT. THANK YOU BOTH LINES ARE OPEN TENNIS- WE I GUESS WE CAN START UP WITH- MS BOWMAN IF HE'S AVAILABLE. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FIFTY BELLA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WE'RE PLEASED TO BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE AUTHOR ALSO I WILL TRY NOT TO REPEAT BUT IT IS CERTAINLY THE PRIMARY CONCERN OF MY MEMBERS. IN RESPONDING. AND SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS INVOLVED EVACUATION WARNINGS AND ORDERS WHICH ARE CRITICAL STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR FIRE CREWS CAN FOCUS ON PROTECTING PROPERTY AND HEALTH BUT ALSO THEMSELVES. RATHER THAN ENGAGING IN DANGEROUS RESCUE EFFORTS THAT THEY AREN'T NECESSARILY TRAINED TO AND THE TEAM- WELL UNCOMPLICATE THESE COMPLICATED SITUATION BUT MEMBERS ARE FAILING TO. EVACUATE DUE TO CONCERN FOR THEIR LIVESTOCK OR DOMESTIC ANIMALS ASSEMBLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS VALID WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY MR GRANT. YOUR AVAILABLE GOOD AFTERNOON TERRY YES GOOD AFTERNOON TERRY THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR GRANT MILLER AND I'M A VETERINARIAN AT THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I SERVICE THE STATE COORDINATOR OF OUR VETERINARY MEDICAL RESERVE CORPS. THROUGH NUMEROUS DEPLOYMENTS TO SOME OF THE LARGEST YOUR DOCTORS IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY WE HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH BOTH THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES THE CALIFORNIA'S ANIMAL EMERGENCY SYSTEM AND BELIEVE THAT SB FIVE FORTY SEVEN REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE STEP FORWARD. DISASTERS BOTH THE CDFA AND UC DAVIS OUR TRUSTED PARTNERS AN ANIMAL DISASTER RESPONSE AND HAVE FOR DECADES WORK DILIGENTLY TO PROTECT ANIMALS DURING DISASTERS HOWEVER. THEIR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN IMPEDED BECAUSE THE MANDATE THAT THEY WORK COMMUTER UNFUNDED. BY SECURING FUNDED IN FUNDING IN THE GENERAL BUDGET SB FIVE FORTY SEVEN WILL ALLOW UC DAVIS TO BARK ON TRAGIC THAT HAVE BEEN ON HOLD DUE TO LACK OF RESOURCES. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WILL ENABLE UC DAVIS TO CREATE A BILL ON THE GROUNDS FIELD RESPONSE TEAM TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE DURING DISASTER RESPONSES. THIS BOOTS ON THE GROUND SUPPORT CANNOT BE DUPLICATED WITHIN THE CDFA. DUE TO LACK OF PRESIDENT PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. HAVING A FIT IF THEY COORDINATE LOGISTICAL UC DAVIS VETERINARY EMERGENCY TEAM WORKS IN THE FIELD WILL BETTER SERVE CALIFORNIA ANIMALS DURING DISASTERS. FOR THESE REASONS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE BILL WILL TAKE OUR STATE AND SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TO HELP CALIFORNIA'S ANIMALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF SB FIVE FORTY SEVEN AND FOR THE ASSEMBLY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL. WE ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MISTER MILLER- THIS TIME THERE'S NO REGISTRAR POSITION TO.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MADAM OPERATOR- THIS TIME BRING IT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE THE QUESTIONS. SOME OF OUR GREAT. THANK YOU AS CHAIR SENATOR COULD YOU WALK ME THROUGH JUST REAL QUICKLY WHAT THE- A FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES ARE HERE BETWEEN THE- UC DAVIS. STATE THAT- CENTER FOR EQUINE HEALTH I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITIES ARE YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS THAT- RELATE TO THE CARE OF- ANIMALS BOTH IN AGRICULTURE IN HORSE RACING INDUSTRY NOW YOU'RE- I WAS BRING UP WHAT WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY. APPROPRIATE CULTURES DICTION INDEED IS THIS A HOUSE TOGETHER UNDER ONE UNIT OR THE SEPARATE UNITS AND I HEARD SOME DISCUSSION OF THE FUNDING ISSUE WHICH I THINK PROBABLY MAKES SOME SENSE WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT. DON'T GET THE FUNDING THEY NEED SO IF YOU COULD HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT THAT BE GREAT. AT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK YOU- RIGHTLY ACKNOWLEDGE REALLY THE- SOME OF THE WONDERFUL PROGRAMMING AND EXPERTISE THAT IS AT UC DAVIS AND A WHOLE. RANGE OF AREAS. PARTLY IN THE SPACE AND OTHERS. I WOULD SAY THAT. YET THE PROGRAM AT THAT EXISTS THERE TODAY IS WITH VOLUNTEERS. IT AN THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO PROFESSIONALISE IT IF YOU WILL. AND TO HAVE IT BE MORE OF AN ESTABLISHED THING WITH- IN GAUGING FROM THE FACULTY AND OTHERS- SO IT REALLY IS TRYING TO ELEVATE THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING WONDERFUL WORK- AGAIN IN THIS AREA AND IN OTHERS- I I'VE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE- THE INTERRELATIONSHIP QUESTION THAT'S PART OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING I DON'T KNOW. A WE TRY NOT TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE AND PRIVATE PROVIDE THE- FLEXIBILITY AND HOPEFULLY THE FUNDING CAN YOU MENTION THAT WE DO HAVE A BUDGET REQUEST AND- SAID THAT WITH THAT THAT PROFESSIONAL LEISING. OF WHAT WE THINK IS NEEDED CAN HAPPEN AND THAT'S STILL TO BE DETERMINED. I APPRECIATE THAT AND- SIR THAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP IN A LATER TIME TO COME TO BETTER. UNDERSTAND THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL EXIST AND I APPRECIATE YOU NOT BEING OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE. TO OFFER THAT'S A BAD HABITS OVER COLLEAGUES OUT HERE AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BETTER LEGISLATORS- IN THIS BUILDING APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND- LOOK ALL HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND- LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING I DO TO BE OF ASSISTANCE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. YES THANK YOU I THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD. HAVE YOU SEEN DISASTERS IN MY OWN DISTRICT- CARE FOR THE ANIMALS AND THE CHALLENGE OF PEOPLE NOT WANTING TO EVACUATE IS SIGNIFICANT- HAVE YOU. ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS SAYS- FOR EXAMPLE WELL I THINK OF- YES HAS. HAS REGION'S AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TEAMS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF THE FIRES THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN WE HAD FOUR FIVE COUNTIES THE SAME TIME FIGHTING THE SAME SIMILAR FIRE- YEAH I DID AYE AYE WIN TEAM ISN'T GOING TO DO IT SO I'M IDEA SO. SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE PART OF ME EXAMPLE IS LIKE I WORK WITH THE CORONER'S OFFICE AND WE'RE PART OF A REGION. AND SO THERE'S A MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS DIFFERENT REGIONS. BASED ON- NEED IS AT SUCH AS THAT KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE IN. OR I'D WE AND- EDUCATION AND COORDINATION AND ASSISTANCE- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT- ALTHOUGH IT'S WORRISOME THAT THE SCALE OF WHAT WE FACE IN OUR STATE AS YOU MENTIONED- COULD POTENTIALLY CROSS MANY SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS AND- I'M CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL AND SO I THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE A- BIG STEP FORWARD. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUT IT IS A AS YOU YOUR QUESTION NOTES AT THIS THIS THE SCALE AND SCOPE COULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT HERE- BECAUSE OF THE DISASTERS THAT YOU HAVE IT. CUTELY FELT IN YOUR AREA. AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GROW THIS IN A IN A GOOD WAY BUT IT'S NOT AS FAST AS MAYBE SOME OF US WOULD WANT AGAIN ANYTIME YOU HAVE A BUDGET IMPLICATION HERE. AND I THINK IT'S THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SCALE THAT WE LIKE BUT I THINK IT WILL. PROVIDE THE PROFESSIONALISM THE EDUCATION THE TRAINING THE ASSISTANCE. OF TO BE AVAILABLE AND HOPEFULLY TO GROW IT IS IT'S DEEMED WORTHY OF GROWTH GREAT GREAT GREAT THANK YOU NOW THAT'S I APPRECIATE THAT I'M- HAPPY SUPPORT THE BILL IF IT GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE I'D LOVE TO BE CONSIDERED AS A CO AUTHOR ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR THANK YOU SIMILAR WOULD WILL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER I GOT CREE THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS THIS IMPORTANT BILL FOR OUR REGION'S. WILL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME WE HAD A BIG FIRE THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED AND- NO NO NO WHAT TO DO WITH THE LIVESTOCK AND WHO CAN HELP THEM OUT SO. AND I ALWAYS MY HEART WENT OUT TO THE PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THAT WERE TRYING TO HELP OUT BUT WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHERE TO GO AND HOW TO BE OF ASSISTANCE AND MAKE SENSE OF- I THINK THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM TO ASSIST IN COORDINATING ALL THOSE PEOPLE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING AFFORD. THANK. YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP. AND WE HAVE A- MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER- THE TO. ACTUALLY TO BE IMPROPER OF ME TO. MAKE THE TERM DON'T WANT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE ON THIS ONE BUT- MAYBE IT'S TOO SOON FOR THAT ANALOGY BUT- ANYWAY I'D APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE I KNOW WELL AFTER THE FIRE SHE SPECIALLY THIS LAST YEAR A LOT OF US CAME UP HERE AND HAD SOME JOINT HEARING AIDS. IN REGARD TO WHAT COULD BE. DEAL FROM THE POLICY SIDE. TO START DOING WITH OUR LIVESTOCK ISSUES IN GETTING ANIMALS OUT. IN BUILDING THE EDUCATION I SEE THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THAT. AND WORKED VERY HARD WITH A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. I ALSO KNOW THAT- OUR COLLEAGUE- ASSEMBLY WOMAN DOLLY HAS A SIMILAR BILL AS FAR AS TRAINING- TO GET ALLOW PEOPLE UP PASSED THE SHUTDOWN BROOCH- UP IN TO ACTUALLY MOVE THE ANIMALS OUT.
