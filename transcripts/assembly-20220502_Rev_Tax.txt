WELCOME MR BENNETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS NOTED- IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE THREE AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY THREE SIMPLY PROVIDES A VOTERS OF INTER COUNTY THE ABILITY TO RAISE HEIR TAXES IF THEY CHOOSE- THE TRANSACTION AND USE TAX TO PROVIDE FOR MORE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. OF THE BILL DOES NOT INCREASE THE TAX ITSELF- THAT'S THE DISCUSSION CONTINUES IN MAY WITH THE VOTERS IT SIMPLY ALLOWS THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS TAX- IN FRONT OF THE VOTER SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT. UNDER EXISTING LAW CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO IMPOSE TRANSITION. TRANSACTIONS IN USED TAXES IN QUARTER CENT INCREMENTS AS LONG AS THE COMBINED RATE IN THE COUNTY DOES NOT EXCEED 2% VENTURA COUNTY HIT THAT CAP ONE ONE CITY RECENTLY PASSED A SALES TAX INCREASE. ON A BI PARTISAN VOTE THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- PASSED A RESOLUTION REQUESTING OUR LEGISLATURE SUBSISTENCE AND RAISING THE COUNTY'S CAP. IN THIS BIPARTISAN- WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER COUNTIES ALSO- IN THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN SIMILAR. ACTION TO ASSIST THOSE LOCALITIES- WITH ME TODAY IS JAMES THURBER WATCHER- FROM THE STATE COUNCIL LABORS AND ANDY FIELDS FROM REBUILD SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- I REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRS MEMBERS MANY CENTER FIELDS AND- I'M HERE REPRESENTING- THE VENTURA COUNTY FIRST COMMITTEE FUNDING INNOVATIVE RELIABLE AND SAFE TRANSPORTATION WE'RE GRASSROOTS COALITION THAT INCLUDES ORGANIZED LABOR SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ECONOMIC GROUPS ENVIRONMENTALISTS ENGINEERS AND LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OVER VARIOUS ITERATIONS WE'VE SUPPORTED INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM IN OUR OVERBURDENED TRANSIT AGENCIES. I WOULD LOVE TO SPEAK MORE ON THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT THE PASSING SUCH A MEASURE WOULD MAKE TO THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OF THE COUNTY OR TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT OF HAVING FEWER CARS IDLING IN TRAFFIC OR TO THE PERSONAL BENEFITS THE VENTURA COUNTY COMMUNITY. AND GETTING WORKING PARENTS HOME FASTER STUDENTS WALKING OR BIKING TO SCHOOL WITH INCREASED SAFETY OR RECREATION ENTHUSIASTS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE CONNECTED COUNTY WIDE BIKE TRAILS BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE I'M ONLY HERE TO ASK YOU TO ALLOW US TO PRESENT TO THE VOTERS OF INTER COUNTY THE CHOICE. OF WHETHER THEY'RE WILLING TO IMPOSE A TAX ON THEMSELVES IN EXCHANGE FOR A WHOLESALE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENT. YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE PREDICAMENT IN THE COUNTY WHEN ONE JURISDICTION REACHES A 2% LOCAL SALES TAX CAP THERE IS MORE THERE IS NO MORE ABILITY TO COLLECTFUNDING FROM. FOR OTHER AREAS OF IMPORTANCE. WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU TO RAISE TAXES JUST AS WE DID NOT ASK THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO RAISE TAXES WHEN THEY VOTED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY THREE. WHICH THEY DID NOT ONLY WITH CUSTOMER WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING YOU TODAY TO AUTHORIZE THE CITIZENS TO VOTE ON THIS ONE VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE WITH A VERY SPECIFIC CAP RELIEF NUMBER OF ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT. TO BE USED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES SET FORTH AND TRANSPORTATION EXPENDITURE PLAN. AS YOU WELL KNOW THIS CAP RELIEF HAS BEEN DONE A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE PAST ALWAYS WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT IF THE COUNTY SUPPORTS THE ITEM. IT CAN BE LEFT THE COUNTY TO IMPLEMENT IT. THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE HERE OUR COMMITTEE HAS PERFORMED PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH TWICE OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. IN HIS RECENTLY AS LAST MONTH WHEN NEWS OF SOARING GAS PRICES AND RAMPANT INFLATION REDDIT'S APEX. THE PEOPLE OF INTER COUNTY OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD WITH THE MEANS TO FIX OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. BECAUSE THE PHONE ON THE MOBILE THE- FOR THE ME TOO LINE IS AN OPTION TODAY I'D LIKE TO REITERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROMINENT SUPPORT WE HAVE FOR AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY THREE. TO NAME A FEW THIS INCLUDES. ORGANISE IT ORGANIZED LABOR SUCH AS THE LABORS OPERATING ENGINEERS CARPENTERS. THE REBUILD SO CAL PARTNERSHIP AND TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES SUCH AS MEISSNER FILTRATION. TORO CONSTRUCTION AND THEN S. ENGINEERING BOYS CONSTRUCTION. W. S. P. THE TWENTY TWENTY NETWORK. THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WRAP IT UP. THANK YOU WE ARE G. A. VOTE. PERFECT TIMING AFTERNOON THAT ENSURING MEMBERS JAMES DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL LABORS HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT AND HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ROUGHLY SIXTY THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE REPRESENT STATEWIDE WHO WORK IN THE HEAVY CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS STAFF- FOR THIS FOR THE SHIPPING INTRODUCING THIS VERY CRITICAL. BILL AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY THREE SIMPLY PROVIDES THE BORDERS OF INTER COUNTY WITH THE ABILITY. TO IMPOSE A TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX TO PROVIDE FOR MORE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. TO MEET VENTURA COUNTY'S CRITICAL MOBILITY NEEDS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT INCREASE. THE TAX ITSELF THAT DISCUSSION WILL REMAIN WITH THE VOTERS. EVEN IF THE VOTERS DO IMPOSE CHOOSE TO OPPOSE THE TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX THE COUNTY WILL JOIN MORE THAN TWENTY OTHER SELF HELP COUNTIES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING THAT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR THE STATE'S LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS SUPPORTED BY THESE PROGRAMS CREATE AND SUPPORT THOUSANDS OF QUALITY MIDDLE CLASS CONSTRUCTION CAREERS AND JOBS. FOR ABOUT BUILDING TRADES WORKERS AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHO WORK WITH STATE AND LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. THEY GET OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE OVERWHELMINGLY MEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR- THE REAL PATHWAYS TO MIDDLE CLASS TO MIDDLE CLASS AND TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. IN ADDITION SUPPORTING LOCAL ROAD REPAIR IN TRANSIT AND PROVEN PROJECTS WILL INCREASE ROADWAY SAFETY FOR BOTH DRIVERS. AND PEDESTRIANS AND A DEEP DECREASES VEHICLE MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR MOTORISTS. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE PROJECT IS MEASURE WOULD SUPPORT INCLUDE PAVING AND RESURFACING ROADS. INVESTING IN SIDEWALKS AND BICYCLE LANES AND REVAMPING AND REPAVING LOCAL BRIDGES AND OVERPASSES AMONG OTHERS. THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM CARRIES WILL BECOME ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE TRACK TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS TO MATCH LOCAL SOURCES OF VOTER APPROVED FUNDING THANK YOU FOR TIME. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AS PART. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OF DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SECOND ALL RIGHT AND COMMENT FROM DR CORK YES SO I'VE WORKED ON BILLS LIKE THIS AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM. DOESN'T LIKE TO INCREASE THE ACTUAL LIMIT BUT HE'S WORKED ON WORKAROUNDS WITH ME FOR EXAMPLE SAYING WELL WE CAN INCREASE WE CAN LET THIS CITY HAVE THIS TAX QUESTION BECAUSE WE WON'T POWER SAY THE BAR TAX. BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW SEPARATE. SO HE'S FOUND WORKAROUNDS BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THE SOONER YOU CAN GET THAT WORKAROUND AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THE BETTER OFF YOU'LL BE. YEAH I THOUGHT- AND DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER. COMMENTS RIGHT AND I DO HAVE A QUICK COMMENT SURE AND- SO I THINK AND I TRIED I DON'T KNOW I SHOULDN'T PUT WORDS INTO THE GOVERNOR'S MATH BUT I KNOW THAT THE REASON THAT I HAVE HISTORICALLY- OPPOSE BILLS LIKE THIS. TIME AND OPPOSE RAISING THE STATE'S 2% CAP IS BECAUSE SALES AND USE TAXES ARE I MEAN IT'S THE MOST REGRESSIVE WAY FOR US TO RAISE REVENUES I'M- SO. GET COMMENTS OR YOU KNOW PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. FROM THE SENATE SPECIALIZED THEY CERTAINLY DO YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT- MANY OF THE OTHER FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THAT WE COMPETE WITH THEY HAVE VALUE ADDED TAXES AND- IT IS THE WAY THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE- THOSE VERY SAME LOW INCOME PEOPLE- SO WELL AND SO I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD SUGGEST THAT. THE EUROPE IS- MORE ENGAGED IN AND THAT SORT OF NOT TAKING CARE OF THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO WHAT'S REGRESSIVE TAXES- THANKS I CERTAINLY THINK THEY FOUND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS ARE REALLY APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS AND THIS IS AS APPROPRIATE ON THE BEST MAN AS YOU CAN GET. IT HELPS EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY- BECAUSE WE ARE ON A COUNTY CLOSE TO LOS ANGELES THAT DOES IS NOT A SELF HELP COUNTY AND I WOULD OFFER. TO DO TWO THINGS ONE. WHEN GOVERNMENT WORKS BEST WHEN IT HELPS PEOPLE HELP THEMSELVES THIS IS GOING TO LET PEOPLE. AS GONNA BURKE IS GONNA LET PEOPLE DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO HELP THEMSELVES AND THEN ALL WE'RE DOING IS JUST TRYING TO SAY OKAY. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO IT THAT I LOVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES- SAME THINGS HAPPENED WHEN WE HAD A- A LOCAL TAX TO BUY A SCHOOL. FOR A LOCAL LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. AND IT WAS A THAT WAS A TAX TO PURCHASE SCHOOL THEY VOTED FOR IT AND WE CAN HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY VOTED TO TAX THEMSELVES. THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT I THINK IS HAPPENING HERE. THE OTHER THING THAT I JUST WHILE I HAVE THE FLOOR HERE FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND ME POINTING OUT IS THAT IS THAT. THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS THAT WE GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON ANYMORE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE COME TO YOU WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FROM THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- AND IF I THINK PART OF WHY WE HAVE THAT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IS BECAUSE WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE HELP THEMSELVES WERE SAYING TO THEM. IF YOU WANT TO DO IT IF YOU WANT TO DO THE WORK ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES TAX YOURSELF AND DO ALL THAT MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS SPENT WILL. WILL HELP YOU BY GETTING OUT OF THE WAY THEY HAVE A THEY HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM NUMBER TRAVIS ALL THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I APPRECIATE. SO LIKE I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND REPEAT AGAIN FOR I THINK THE FIFTH TIME THAT THIS IS NOT RAISING TAXES THIS IS GIVING THE ABILITY OF INTER COUNTY TO. OF TO RAISE TAXES AND THIS IS WE HAVE KIND OF A UNIQUE SITUATION. THERE ARE PROBABLY. FOUR OR FIVE CITIES THAT HAVE NEVER RAISE THEIR TAX SO THEY ARE AT THE VERY LOWEST LEVEL IN THE STATE. SO THERE'S IT JUST HAPPENS THAT ONE CITY IS THE ONE THAT'S THAT'S AT THE LIMIT THAT IS KIND OF CAUSING THAT ISSUE. AND WE ARE- UNFORTUNATELY LOSING OUT ON A LOT OF MATCHING FUNDS IN VENTURA COUNTY SO. WE WILL SEE IF THE VOTERS DECIDE THIS TIME THAT'S THE OR I SHOULD SAY IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DECIDE THAT THEY ARE. WILLING TO INCREASE THE TAXES ON THEMSELVES BUT I THINK THE ARGUMENT WILL BE THAT WE'RE LOSING OUT ON A LOT OF PROJECT FUNDING BECAUSE WE ARE NOT A SELF HELP COUNTY SO. AND WE'LL SEE THAT IF WE CAN HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. ALL RIGHT AND- SO YOU'VE AGREED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDING THAT ANY DISTRICT TAXES IMPOSED UNDER THIS TAX WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE COMBINED ALL RIGHT. OF WITH THAT WE HAD A- MOTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE AND A SECOND PIE ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE FLOOR MS HIGHLAND PLACE TO CALL THE ROLL. ON AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS CEMENTED. IRWIN HI- WHEN I WHEN. WHEN NO GRAY. GREAT I GRAYSON GRAYSON I LIVING LEVINE I MAYES MULLIN. MULLIN AYE MULLIN AYE PETRIE-NORRIS EACH UNIVERSITY WILL KIRK OUR- WAY RIVAS I RIVAS ICE SEYARTO. CYRANO. IT SEVENTY THREE THE BILL'S THE BILL ITSELF THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT.

AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE OR TO PROVIDE A TAX DEDUCTION FOR TEACHERS SO WHO SPEND THEIR OWN MONEY FOR INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND THE CLASSROOM SUPPLIES. 94% OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS TO SPEND ABOUT THE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS SUPPORT YEAR ON CLASSROOM SUPPLIES. WHY ARE SOME SUPPLIES ARE ARE REIMBURSED UP BY THE- SCORES SO MANY DEDICATED TEACHERS SO SHE THE NEEDS IN THEIR CLASSROOM AND THE FIELD OF COMPOUND TO HELP THEIR STUDENTS- BY PURCHASING ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES OF SUCH AS A WORK BOOKS.

THIS BILL RECOGNIZES OF DEDICATED TEACHERS AND THE HOUSE OF TO DEFRAY THE COST OF FOR THE- PURCHASES. SO FOR THE- CLASSROOMS. WE DON'T HAVE ONE IN PRESENTS. OR ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE ROOM IN SUPPORT ALL RIGHT YEAH BOB. SO MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT HALF THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DON'T PAY TOP STATE TAXES AT ALL. ARE THEY PAID THE FEDERAL TAX. AND MOST PEOPLE PAY A FEW PERCENT 234% BUT IF YOU. IF YOU'RE A TEACHER AND YOUR HUSBAND MAKES A MILLION DOLLARS YEAR YOU'RE PAYING 13% TO JUST GET A LOT MORE BACK IF YOU'RE WEALTHY AND YET YOU'RE MORE ABLE TO PAY IT IF YOU'RE WEALTHY- I OULD PREFER TAX CREDIT RATHER THAN A TAX DEDUCTION. THANK YOU. THE ELEVEN- A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE- BUT LAST YEAR WE TRIED THE TAX CREDIT AND- THIS- COMMITTEE- AND THEN ALSO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE HAD THE CONCERN- TO MANY PEOPLE ASK FOR FULL. VARIOUS TO THINGS FALL PREDECESSORS SO THIS YEAR- HE- TRY I AM TRYING TO MAKE IT TAX DEDUCTION INTO SOMETHING WOULD BE MUCH BETTER THAN NOTHING.

I WOULD LIKE TO THANK- MISTER DAVID KNIGHT THE WHOLE SUPPRESSANT HERE- WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY ACTION PARTNERSHIP ASSOCIATION OF FOR JOINING ME TODAY A TO ASSISTANCE TO A TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON AND AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR CHOI HAD SAID I'M DAVID KNIGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ACTION PARTNERSHIP ASSOCIATION. WE ARE NONPROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION BASED IN SACRAMENTO THAT IS COMPRISED OF SIXTY COMMITTEE ACTION AGENCIES COMMITTEE SERVICE BLOCK GRANT ELIGIBLE AGENCIES. THROUGHOUT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA NO EACH AGENT EACH AGENCY WE REPRESENT CREATES LOCALLY DEVELOP SOLUTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS THE MINISTERS CRITICAL FUNDING. AND SERVICES TO HELP ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIANS IN MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES TO MAINTAIN STABILITY INCREASED OPPORTUNITY TO DO TO ACHIEVE SELF RELIANCE. NOW BEHALF OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OUR AGENCIES I'M HERE TO LEND THEIR SUPPORT FOR A BI EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEVEN CHOI. NOW CALCUTTA MEMBERS FOCUS HEAVILY ON CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROSPER IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES ASSEMBLY MEMBER STORY MEASURES A MAJOR STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR EACH COMMUNITY WE SERVE. OUR STATE HAS BEEN FOCUSING A LOT ON HOUSING WE OFTEN HEAR THE WORDS HOUSING HOMELESS OR RENT ORDERED FROM A- COLLECTIVE FISHER'S DALY. WE HAVE TO MENTION HOMELESS IS A PROBLEM IN OUR STATE YET IN ACTUALITY IT IS CURRENTLY THE SOLUTION TO MULTIPLE OTHER PROBLEMS ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY ARE AWARE OF SOME THE ACTUAL PROBLEMS THAT LEAD TO THESE CURRENT ON WANTED SOLUTIONS. WE CAN'T TACKLE ALL THE ISSUES IN EVERY BILL BUT AB IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE DEMONSTRATES A STRONG SOLUTION TOWARDS OVERCOMING ONE MAJOR GLARING ACTUAL PROBLEM IN OUR STATE. THE CONTINUED LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING. NUMBER BY PROVIDING A TAX CREDIT TO A PROPERTY OWNER FOR LEASING WATER MORE RESIDENTIAL UNITS BELOW MARKET VALUE TO AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD RECEIVING HOUSING SERVICES OR ASSISTANCE FROM A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. AB EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE IS A REALISTIC THOUGHTFUL SOLUTION TO CREATING THE MUCH NEEDED ACCESS THIS ONGOING LACK OF ACCESS TO SOMETHING SAME ARE AGENCIES EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU NEED TO DO TWO THINGS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FAMILIES WE SERVE. GREAT FUNDING GREAT ACCESS ALL THE FUNDING OVER TO THE COUNTRY CAN CAN OFFER DOESN'T CREATE ACCESS. FOR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT ACCESS TO USE IT. HE WILL YEARS TO THE ME TO GO OF ECHO HOUSING STATE THEY'VE BEEN SET FORTH BUT- ARE STRONG. TODAY ACQUIRING THE LAND IS VALUABLE BUILDING AND YOU CAN IT'S TIME CONSUMING BUT THE CURRENT RENTAL HOUSING STOCK. WHICH COULD GIVE ACCESS TO A FAMILY RIGHT ON THE VERGE OF TYPING IN HOMELESS TODAY. IS A REAL PRACTICAL SOLUTION FOR TODAY WHILE ALSO ENSURING LONG TERM SUCCESS FOR THE FUTURE. SETTING A PRACTICE OF CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MULTI LEVELS OF INCOME TO RESIDE TOGETHER WITHIN COMMUNITY. WITH EXECS IN HOUSING RATHER THAN SIMPLY RELYING ON YOU BILLS. IS A SOUND POLICY THAT WILL ASSIST OUR AGENCIES MEET THEIR MISSION. HOWEVER WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO HELP IN DEVELOPING OUR COMMUNITIES TOGETHER. A FATHER DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING UNIT. NOT TO EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND PER YEAR IS AN AMAZING STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I HOPE YOU WILL NOT ONLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CHOICE LEGISLATION BUT MAKE IT- AND RENTAL AND OTHER RENTAL TAXES IN OF THE BUDGET PRIORITIES. THIS IS SMART PUBLIC POLICY NOW IS THE TIME TO USE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE TO OUR STATE TO OUR FAMILIES. AND ALLOW ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON BEHALF OF CAL CAMPUS BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU- MISTER I KNOW WHETHER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I ASSUME- DO WE HAVE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM AND SUPPORT. ANYBODY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. I SAID THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD. THE DEFINITION OF- FAIR MARKET VERSES UNDER MARKET IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE SO HOW. IN THE MOMENT MORE LOOKING AT FISCAL POLICY WE CANNOT LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE SUBJECT OF IT HAS TO BE OBJECTIVE IT HAS TO BE YOU KNOW HARD NUMBERS SO HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU POSSIBLY CALCULATE THAT AND HOW WITH THE STATE POSSIBLY BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS. CAN I ANSWER I THINK THAT'S A VERY VERY SIMPLE- QUESTION ANY- RENTAL UNIT OWNERS THE GOAL BY- PREVAILING. ARE RENTAL OF PRICE AND OBVIOUSLY THEY WANNA RENT THEY ARE RENTAL YOU NEED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN WAITING BECAUSE OF TIME IS S. AS- OF WHAT THEY'RE MAKING MONEY- SO THEY WILL DO THEIR MARKET RESEARCH AND WHAT THE PRICE WOULD BE RIGHT UP AND ASKING PRICE AT THAT THE SO MARKET PRICE. AND THE IF THE SELF FOR EXAMPLE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OF. AND THE RENT IT FOR AFFORDABLE LEVEL WAR NONPROFIT THOUGH MORE PEOPLE WITH THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE SO LET'S SAY FOR TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT IS A DISCOUNT PRICES. RIGHT IT'S MISTER KNIGHT RIGHT SO- UP I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE OF YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT- FORT IF WE'RE TRYING TO BE EFFICIENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT DOLLARS. DOES IT REALLY MAKE SENSE TO START A- BRAND NEW- CREDIT PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO SUPPORTING A ESTABLISH PROGRAM OR MORE ROBUSTLY SUPPORTING ONE OF THE ESTABLISH PROGRAMS. I THINK FOR US IN OUR AGENCIES IN THE FAMILIES WE SERVE. IT DEPENDS ON SPECIFICALLY WHAT PROGRAM WE MAY BE DISCUSSING ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE CONSTANTLY SEE IN OUR IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE WE HAVE UNITS THAT ARE BUILT AND THEY'RE BUILT WITH INCENTIVIZE PROGRAMS RIGHT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. IN THOSE UNITS SIT VACANT BECAUSE THERE'S NO DIRECT CORRELATION THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO ABILITY TO TRACK WHETHER AN ACTUAL FAMILIES IN THOSE UNITS AND I THINK WITH THIS TAX CREDIT IN THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IS ALLOWS US TO SAY. WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S A FAMILY IN THAT PLACE BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHOW THAT THAT FAMILIES IN THAT IN THAT LOCATION. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE SEE ON THE GROUND EVERY DAY AND THAT'S WHAT THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WE HAVE. THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH OTHER TAX YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING IF THE- IF DEVELOPERS ARE USING OTHER TYPES OF. TAX CREDITS THAN THE UNITS ARE OFTEN SITTING EMPTY. CORRECT WE SEE THAT QUITE A BIT IS THE ISSUE IS THAT. UNITS WILL END UP BEING LONG TERM INDIANS NOT ACCESSIBLE- AND THEY SHOULD BE HAVE ACCESS TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT'S JUST SOMETHING WE SEE ON A COST BASIS. AS A CONCERN FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE- ARE NOT NECESSARILY ALLOWED TO COME INTO THOSE UNITS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS YOU KNOW MAYBE A LOT OF THE FAMILIES WE SERVE HAVE HAVE MULTI. GENERATIONAL FAMILIES IN ONE PLACE THEY DON'T GET ACCESS TO THOSE THINGS AND THAT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO DO OUR WORK. OKAY ALL RIGHT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE DR CHOI. OKAY IF YOU DO VOTE TODAY I WOULD LOVE TO GET YOU OFF- SUPPORT IF NOT THEN THE WHEN YOU COME TO THAT POINT TO ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALKED CHOI FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT UP WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. GOOD AFTERNOON MR FONG YOU CAN MAKE PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. I THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS. STILL RECOVERING FROM THE COVERED PANDEMIC NONPROFITS AND EMPLOYERS- STILL CANNOT ABSORB SIGNIFICANT EXTRA COSTS SITTING ON A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET SURPLUS AT THE MOMENT THE STATE CAN INSURE THAT NONPROFITS AND EMPLOYERS ARE SUPPORTED WHILE EMPLOYEES ARE PROVIDED SICK LEAVE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES OR FAMILY MEMBERS THIS BILL AB NINETEEN TWENTY PROVIDES SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS WITH NEEDED TAX RELIEF TO OFFSET THE COST. OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT WAS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE THESE ARE HOMELESS SHELTERS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS CHILD CENTERS- A LOCAL ANIMAL SHELTERS IN A BEEN A BUSINESSES AND ALL YOU NEED BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES THESE ARE THE SAME RESILIENT BUSINESSES THAT HAVE FACED CONSTANT UNCERTAINTY WHILE MANAGING TO RETAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES WITHOUT THIS TAX RELIEF THOSE JOBS AND BUSINESSES ARE PUT AT RISK. A HOMELESS SHELTER IN MY DISTRICT SAID THERE ANNUAL BUDGET BEFORE THE SIGNING OF S. B. ONE ONE FOUR AND BECAUSE SB ONE ONE FOUR WAS RETROACTIVE TO THE START OF THE YEAR. THEY FACE IMMEDIATE ARE NOT ENORMOUS AND ON BUDGET COSTS THIS TAX CREDIT IS MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS X. AS X. ASSESSABLE LAST YEAR TO OFFSET A SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE HOWEVER THOSE CREDITS HAVE EXPIRED AND EMPLOYERS ARE LEFT TO REBUILD DURING A PERIOD OF HIGH INFLATION BALL TILE LABOR MARKETS AND MORE STATE MANDATES. ALSO THIS TAX CREDIT IS SPECIFICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY TARGETED AT SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS PROP AND NONPROFITS THAT ARE PILLARS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND ARE IN MOST NEED OF FINANCIAL RELIEF AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WOULD ASK FOR AYE BUT WHEN IT'S- WHEN THE TIME COMES AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER FIND YOU HAVE ANY REDNESS IS NOT TIME AT IT ANY WITNESSES IN THE ROOM AND SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YOU KNOW IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE COULD. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RETURN TAXES BECAUSE WE'VE GONE OVER THE GALLON BUT- IF THIS ARE BILL COULD USE DAM LIMIT MONEY TO PAY PEOPLE BACK I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS IT COULD BE JUST TO. IN L. APPROXIMATE. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO GO THROUGH EVERYBODY CLAIMING THIS IS THE ABOUT BUT GIVING MONEY BACK TO OF THE CORPORATIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I IN A WAY THAT SORT OF- WOULD COMPENSATE THEM FOR TYPICAL AMOUNTS OF SICK LEAVE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE GIVEN OUT DURING THAT TIME PERIOD MAYBE CERTAIN AMOUNT PER EMPLOYEE. WHATEVER I THINK THIS WOULD BE FEASIBLE IF WE COULD. FIND IT THAT WAY THROUGH THE GALA BUT ACCESS. OF DO YOU OR DOES THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED TO SEE ANYONE HAVE AN IDEA WHETHER OR NOT THAT COULD BE DONE. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND THE COMMITTEE- CAN CORRECT ME BUT- THAT BEGAN IF ANYBODY'S ABOVE AGAIN LIMIT WOULD HAVE THE BROAD BASED ACTUALLY IF THIS IS A VERY TARGETED TAX CREDIT- AT THAT IS TO SPEAK TO FILL A SPECIFIC GAP THAT WAS CREATED- WENDY ADDITIONAL SICK PAY LEAVE A PROPOSAL WAS PUT INTO PLACE. BUT WHEN THE ORIGINAL SICK PAY LEAVE PROPOSAL WAS PASSED- AT THE BAD DURING THE PANDEMIC- THERE WAS A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT IN PLACE THAT ALLOWED SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS- TO TAKE IT TO OFFSET THOSE COSTS. WHEN THE- WHEN SB WOMAN FOR WAS A WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THAT FEDERAL TAX RATE HAD EXPIRED. SO NOW THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS IN OUR COMMUNITY HAVE TO ABSORB AT A COST BECAUSE IT WAS RETROACTIVE TO THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR BUT I WOULD DEFER TO THE- TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTED OR THE CHAIR- IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I GOT INCORRECT OR THAT WAS. THAT WAS WRONG. CONSULTANTS LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING. I'M CERTAINLY NOT AN EXPERT ON THE GANN LIMIT BUT I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN BE IT DOES SPEAK TO RETURNING MONEY TO REVISION OF TAX RATES OR FEE SCHEDULES AND NOT TAX CREDITS TO PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL- IF THERE'S A WAY I'LL CERTAINLY SUPPORT. I'VE BRIGITTE THAT HAS A BUNCH OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH AGAIN LIMIT AND WE'RE WAITING FOR THE MAY REVISION SO- WE ARE CERTAINLY- EAGER- IF THERE ISN'T. A WAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TAX RELIEF- THROUGH DO IT IS A REVENUES THERE ARE GOING TO MATERIALIZE OR HAVE MATERIALIZED. WE CERTAINLY ARE WELCOME THAT CONVERSATION. A JUST A COMMENT REALLY SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD- YEAH I THINK. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED FIVE. SB NINETEEN TWENTY. BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH IMPERATIVE I. TO DO SO AND- YOU KNOW I'M OF THE VIEW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE OF THE VIEW THAT. I IT'S THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT. TO MEET THAT COST. NOT THE ROLE OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS- SO. WOULD ALSO BE VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AND- I'M DO YOU HOPE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE PROPS AND- CREATIVE. APPROACHES IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT UNDER THE PROJECT THAT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD THINKING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VALLADARES. YOU ARE UP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS IT'S MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT AB TWO EIGHT ZERO THREE WHICH WILL HELP INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH CHILDCARE SERVICES AS A FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT PRESCHOOL AND CHILD CARE CENTER WHERE WE SERVE CHILDREN FROM EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO FIVE YEARS NOT OF SCHOOL AGE I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW ESSENTIAL CHILD CARE IS TO A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT. AND TO PARENTS PARTICIPATION IN THE WORKFORCE THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED WORRISOME TRENDS IN THE CHILD CARE INDUSTRY OUR WORK FORCES WHEN DEALING CHILD CARE OPENINGS ARE VANISHING ANDSOME PARENTS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RETURN TO THE WORK FORCE AS A RESULT. THOSE WHO ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND IN A FOURTEEN OPENING ARE FORCED TO PAY PRETTY MUCH A FORTUNE CHILD CARE COSTS ARE SKYROCKETING CALIFORNIA AND WORKING PARENTS AND CARE GIVERS ARE MAKING UNIMAGINABLE SACRIFICES TO FOOT THE BILL FOR MANY FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE REPRESENTS THEIR LARGEST MONTHLY EXPENSE ONE STUDY HAD CALIFORNIA'S AVERAGE ANNUAL PRICE OF CHILDCARE TAGGED AT ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS ELEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS. THIS IS JUST TOO HIGH THIS BILL REALLY AIMS TO HELP THE MISSING MIDDLE CALIFORNIA HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB ALLOCATING CHILD CARE SLOTS FOR THOSE AND LOW INCOME OR SUFFERING FROM POVERTY- HOWEVER THE MIDDLE CLASS MAKES TOO MUCH MONEY TO QUALIFY FOR CHILD CARE SERVICES BY THE STATE AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR CHILD CARE. IN ORDER TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE WORK FORCE WE MILLIONS OF PARENTS NEED MORE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE OPTIONS AND MORE SUPPORT THAT'S WHY I'VE INTRODUCED AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE WHICH OFFERS CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS A TAX CREDIT FOR DEPENDENT CARE SUPPORT AS A STANDARD BENEFIT FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND DOING SO THE BILL UP CLOSE CARE GIVING SUPPORT GAS BY INCENTIVIZING. EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY SMALL AND MICRO SIZE BUSINESSES TO OFFER THEIR EMPLOYEES ASSISTANCE WITH CHILD CARE COSTS. EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE EMPLOYER PROVIDED CHILD CARE TAX CREDITS BY PASSING AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE THE LEGISLATURE WILL NOT ONLY HELP CONNECT PARENTS WITH CHILD CARE. BUT WILL PROVIDE OUR BUSINESS IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE AND RECRUITING TALENTED WORKERS THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGES A DIVERSE CHILD CARE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. AND WILL HELP ENSURE EMPLOYERS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE CARE OPTIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN pVOTED ON TODAY I HOPE THAT WE CAN BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR A VOTE A VOTE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD. WITH ME TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE AS BRIAN JAMALI WITH CARE .COM. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TEST. FOR YOU TODAY. MY NAME'S BRIAN SMELLING THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC% POLICY FOR CARE DOT COM- WE'RE A LEADING PLATFORM FOR FINDING AND MANAGING HIGH QUALITY FAMILY CARE AND THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM CHILD CARE TO SENIOR CARE TO OTHER TYPES OF HOME CARE IN ASSISTING THE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WITHIN THE HOME AS WELL- AND TETIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY OH THREE- THIS BILL. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOTERS MENTIONED TO CREATE A MODERNIZED EMPLOYER PROVIDED CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD BENEFIT WORKING FAMILIES. I IN THE OVERALL CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BY REDUCING THE COST OF CARE FOR WORKING FAMILIES INCREASING ACCESS. TO CARE BY PROVIDING MORE FLEXIBLE AN EQUITABLE OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES. I INCREASING LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION ESPECIALLY AMONG WOMEN. THE CONCEPT IS NOT NEW TAX POLICY DISCUSSIONS CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN STATES OFFER- EMPLOYER PROVIDED CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY DOES NOT OFFER A STATE LEVEL COMPLEMENT- AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE WOULD NOT ONLY ADD CALIFORNIA TO THAT LIST OF STATES THAT OFFER THIS CREDIT. BUT WOULD SERVE AS A NEW NATIONAL MODEL. FOR MODERNIZE CREDIT BY INCORPORATING SPECIFIC CREDIT DESIGN AND POLICY CHANGES SUGGESTED IN A RECENT GAO REPORT- EXAMINE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE FEDERAL LEVEL CREDIT- INTO OF THOSE WAYS- THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO MODERNIZE THIS IN ADDITION TO- THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTS INCLUDED IN. OTHER STATE CREDITS AND FEDERAL CREDITS IS TO. EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF QUALIFIED CARE EXPENDITURES TO INCLUDE IN HOME CARE AND BACK UP CARE. OPTIONS SO THAT THE FULL PORTFOLIO OF CARE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO WORKING FAMILIES. AND SECONDLY PROVIDING MORE GENEROUS CREDIT TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. IN RECOGNITION OF THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VALLADARES- MENTIONS OF THE CARE GAPS THAT EXIST SO I WON'T BE REDUNDANT AND REPEATING THOSE POINTS. BUT WE'RE REALLY TARGETING- THE POOL OF FOLKS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CARE SPECTRUM THAT REALLY HAVE NO TOOLS IN THEIR TOOL BOX AGAIN THEY CAN'T ACCESS SUBSIDY PROGRAMS. AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY A POLICY- REALLY IS THE ONLY TOOL IN THEIR TOOLBOX THAT'S A BUILT ON WHETHER IT'S CHILD DEPENDENT CARE TAX CREDITS IF THEY'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO. BE OFFERED A DEPENDENT CARE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER. OR HAVE ASSISTANCE AND SUBSIDIES THROUGH EMPLOYER PROVIDED CHILD CARE CREDIT LIKE THE ONE WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER ONLY ABOUT 11% OF WORKERS NATIONALLY HAVE ACCESS TO EMPLOYER PROVIDED CHILD CARE. SO THAT GAP JUST CONTINUES TO STAY STAGNANT ALONG THAT SPECTRUM AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND STRATEGIC IN CLOSING THAT GAP. CHUKKER ISN'T JUST EXPENSIVE FOR CALIFORNIA WORKING FAMILIES FOR SOME IT IS EVEN AVAILABLE- CALIFORNIA IS A STATE 60% OF THE POPULATION LIVE IN CHILD CARE DESERTS. AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY CENSUS TRACT WHICH IS NOT HAVE ENOUGH. SUPPLY TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR CHILDCARE SLOTS. IN IN THOSE PARTICULAR TRACKS- IN THE DESERT'S ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR MOTHERS IN THE WORKFORCE AND US THEIR SECRET DRIVER OF THE OVERALL LABOR SHORTAGE. IN CALIFORNIA. AND WITH HYBRID MODELS WORK LIKELY HERE TO STAY IN THE RISE OF THE DECENTRALIZED WORKFORCES ACROSS INDUSTRIES. COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING FOR. MORE FLEXIBLE CARE OPTIONS. WITH THREE DAYS IN THE OFFICE I TWO DAYS AT HOME FOR TWO DAYS IN THE OFFICE AND THREE DAYS AT HOME. FAMILIES ARE JUST NOT TAKING THEIR CHILDREN INTO THEIR OFFICE BUILDING AND DROPPING THEM OFF AT THE CENTER AND THE LOBBY OR DOWN THE STREET. THEIR HOME A FEW DAYS THERE ARE WORKING FOR A COUPLE DAYS AND THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY MORE SEEING THOSE TRENDS CERTAINLY- ON OUR PLATFORMS AS IS I THINK ALL- ALL ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN PROVIDING CHILDCARE SUPPORT. TO FAMILIES. SO AB TWENTY OF THREE WE'LL CERTAINLY ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AS WELL. OUR I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE ALL KNOW THE NATIONAL CAREGIVING CRISIS IS NOT NEW BUT IT'S BEEN EXASPERATED BY THE PANDEMIC- THE ECONOMIC LOSS TO OUR COUNTRY TO CALIFORNIA'S IN THE BILL AND BILLIONS AND THE NUMBER ONE WHO LEFT THE LABOR FORCE BECAUSE OF CODE BECAUSE OF CHILDCARE DUTIES. IS ASTRONOMICAL AND SO THIS IS REALLY A TARGETED APPROACH INTO ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES AND CERTAINLY SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH IS A NEW WAY OF APPROACHING THIS- CONSIDERING THAT THERE'S THREE POINT NINE SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REPRESENT- HALF OR MORE OF THE PRIVATE WORKFORCE HERE AT ARMS SUCH AS ECONOMIC ENGINE- THE FACT THAT THEY CAN NOT. AT ALL FOR TO SUPPORT THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH CHILDCARE- BECAUSE IT'S TOO PROHIBITIVE FOR THEM TO BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PRESSURES AND BECAUSE CODE IS JUST A HIGHLIGHTED THE FRAGILITY OF THESE BUSINESSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN SPECIALLY CALIFORNIA TO- WE REALLY WANTED TO TARGET THIS AND BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW COULD WE INCENTIVIZE SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALLOW THEM TO BE SUPPORTIVE. OF THEIR WORKERS MANY OF WHOM WORK NONTRADITIONALHOURS OR SHIFT WORK- AND AGAIN THESE ARE THE ONES WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE I CAN'T PAY FOR IT ON THEIR OWN. AND WITH CALIFORNIA BEING A NATIONAL LEADER IN SUPPORTING WOMAN AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND OTHER POLICIES WE THINK THAT THIS FITS WITH WITH WHAT CALIFORNIA IS GOOD DOING WHICH IS SERVING AS A NATIONAL MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK KIDS FORTUNATELY WITH ENOUGH MONEY SO WE COULD AFFORD TO NEIGHBORHOOD DAY CARE FROM FROM MOMS I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GET THE MAIN THING WOULD BE GETTING THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET- WE EITHER NEED TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS. OR SOME SORT OF CREDIT THAT WE CAN GIVE TO PARENTS BUT THIS IS A CENTRAL HI HAVE YOU HAD BUDGET DISCUSSIONS. IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE ARE STILL AN IN THE WORKS OF DISCUSSING AND DEFINITELY AN OPTION BUT RIGHT NOW WE THINK THAT DIRECT PAYMENTS- I'M SORRY FOR DIRECT K. CREDITS TO THE BUSINESSES IS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES ACTUALLY GET THIS. ALL RIGHT WELL- POLVO FOR IT HERE- THE MAIN THING WILL BE GETTING MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO FUND. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT OF I'D I JUST I'M TRYING TO KIND OF- WRAP MY MIND AROUND THE TAX CREDITS ARE SO THE EMPLOYERS ARE GETTING TAX CREDITS FOR THE PLATFORMS ALSO RIGHT. IF YOU USE THAT IF YOU USE THE PLATFORM THEN THAT THAT THE EMPLOYER IS GOING TO GET A TAX CREDIT FOR THAT. YEAH OTHER FOR THE WITNESS YES IT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A MANAGER SO THE EMPLOYER IS BENEFITING FROM TAX RATE BECAUSE THEY'RE SUBSIDIZING OFFERING THESE CARE BENEFIT TALK INTO THE MICROPHONE I'M SORRY FOR THE PLANS NAME I'M SAYING IT INTO TO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE BECAUSE WHAT I'VE NOTICED WITH THE I MEAN WITH THE LEAD THERE'S NOT A LONG LIST OF SUPPORTERS EXCEPT FOR YOUR COMPANY AND SO- AND YOU'RE PROVIDING A PLATFORM SO I'M ASSUMING THAT THE THERE'S A COST TO THE PLATFORM AND THE EMPLOYERS GETTING AT TAX CREDIT FOR THAT. YES SO THE WAY THAT THIS IS STRUCTURED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND BE COMPLEMENTARY STATE LEVEL CREDITS THAT DO EXIST SO RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS TERMED A QUALIFIED EXPENDITURES THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS CENTER BASED CARE FAMILY CHILD CARE OR UTILIZING WHICH TERMS- CHILD CARE RESOURCE REFERRAL SERVICE THOSE ARE ALL TERMS THAT COME OUT OF THE SEA CDBG THE CHILD CARE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDING SCHEMA- THOSE TERMS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S A BLOCK GRANT GOING TO THE STATES- IN SO UNDER THAT SCENARIO IF THE EMPLOYER IS CONTRACTING WITH FOR EXAMPLEA BRICK AND MORTAR CHILD CARE CENTER IN PAYING THEM FOR LET'S SAY YOU KNOW THEY NEGOTIATE FOR TEN SLOTS FOR THEIR TEN EMPLOYEES KID- AND THEN THE UTILIZED THAT SO THEY'RE WRITING DOWN THE COST OF THEIR PAYING A BRICK AND MORTAR SHOP. TO PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND SIMILARLY WITH THE FAMILY CHILDCARE CENTER OR SIMILARLY WITH A CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL SO IN THIS INSTANCE AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING THE MODERNIZATION PIECE IF YOU WILL IS TO EXPAND IT TO INCLUDE IN HOMECARE AND BACK UP CARE OPTIONS WHICH IS WHAT PLATFORMS LIKE CARE .COM OFFERS WELLS BUT WE ALSO HAVE WITHIN OUR NETWORK CHILD CARE CENTERS THAT WE CONTRACT WITH TO HELP THE BACKUP CARE SPOTS AND SO IT KIND OF RUNS THE GAMUT- IN SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PROPOSE ANYTHING THAT'S SPECIFICALLY BENEFITING US MORE DIRECTLY THAN THE CURRENT SCHEME IS ALREADY DUE FOR THE WAY THAT THAT'S CREDIT- INTERACTS AND HOW THE HOW THE EMPLOYERS CAN CAN TAKE THAT. AND I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY WE'RE PROPOSING HERE FOR CALIFORNIA THAT THIS DOESN'T JUST INCLUDE CARE .COM SERVICES- YOU KNOW OUR COMPETITORS WITH BENEFIT FROM IT- ALSO INCLUDING. CENTER BASED CARE. ON SITE CARE FOR EMPLOYERS DECIDES TO PUT CAPITAL EXPENSES INTO BUILDING NOT. ON IT WOULD BE IN CONFORMITY OR AT LEAST WE ENVISION THAT IT WOULD BE IN CONFORMITY MAY BE HAPPY TO FURTHER DEFINE THAT DEFINITION ONLY AND ALIGN THAT WITH THE FEDERAL CREDIT- BUT WE'RE REALLY JUST PROPOSING THAT YOU PUT. ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE FOR FAMILIES- ESPECIALLY IN RECOGNITION. OF THE HYBRID WORKFORCE ENVIRONMENT IN THE CHANGING DYNAMICS. OF THEIR NEEDS FOR CARAMEL. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND IT IS FOR THE COURT CLARIFIED DOES IT CREATES- A CREDIT UNDER THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND CORPORATE TAX SO. IT WOULD ACTUALLY GO TO PERSON THE REASON WHY PERSONAL INCOME TAXES BECAUSE IT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE. SMALL FAMILY PROVIDERS WHO ARE SOLE PROPRIETORS OF THEIR CHILD CARE CENTER- WITHIN THEIR OWN HOME AND OR OBVIOUSLY CORPORATE TAX ALSO WOULD ALSO APPLY TO BUSINESSES WHO ARE INCORPORATED. RIGHT OKAY. THANK YOU- WOULD YOU LIKE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WAS LIKE TO CLOSE. YES AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE IS A POWERFUL OPPORTUNITY SUPPORT THE MISSING MIDDLE. AND TO SUPPORT BUSINESSES THAT NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE IN CALIFORNIA'S IN RECRUITING CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE. CHILD CARE IS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS PARENTS WITH ENOUGH SUPPORT IN OPTIONS TO ENSURE THAT CHILD CARE IS ACCESSIBLE. AND AFFORDABLE FOR ALL I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IF IT COMES UP BEFORE YOU FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AGAIN.

THIS TAX CREDIT IS TARGETED TOWARD SMALLER MOM AND POP BUSINESSES WITH FORTY NINE OR FEWER EMPLOYEES THIS IS A CREDIT OF FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES CAN BENEFIT FROM PER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE. THIS AMOUNT TAX INCREASES RELATED TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THE HOPE IS THAT THIS CREDIT CAN OFFSET SOME OF THOSE COSTS. SMALL BUSINESSES NEED ALL OF THE HELP THEY CAN GET ESPECIALLY AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN. IT IS WIDELY KNOWN THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST DURING THE PANDEMIC. THESE ARE THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY STRUGGLED WITH JOB SCARCITY DUE TO LIMITED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND AS A RESULT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE A PART OF THE STATE'S COMMUTER REGION'S STRUGGLING WITH HIGH TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND POLLUTION. REDUCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FURTHERING HEALTH AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES ALL OF THESE ISSUES DECREASED THE HOPE THE CALIFORNIA WILL MEET AT ZERO IT'S ZERO EMISSIONS GOALS IN A TIMELY MATTER.
