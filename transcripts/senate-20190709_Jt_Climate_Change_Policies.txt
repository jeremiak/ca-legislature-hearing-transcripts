on this server.</p> APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA IS THIRTY NINE AND A HALF MILLION RESIDENTS. STILL LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT EXCEED THE FEDERAL HEALTH TANDARDS EXPOSURE TO DIESEL PARTICULATES IS TOO HIGH ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES NEAR FREIGHT FACILITIES SUCH AS PORTS RAILYARDS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE LOCATED CLOSE TO FREEWAYS AN INDUSTRIAL SOURCES. EXPOSURE TO OZONE POLLUTION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS LED TO A THESE SOURCES. FROM. TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN RESPONSE TO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN'S DIRECTION TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC ACCESS TO EMISSIONS AND INVENTORY DATA. CARB DEVELOP THE POLLUTION MAPPING TOOL THE POLLUTION MAPPING TOOL WHICH IS A PUBLICLY WHICH IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE CARD WEBSITE. ALLOWS USERS TO IDENTIFY AND COMPARE THE GREENHOUSE GAS CRITERIA POLLUTANT TOXIC AIR. EMISSIONS OF FACILITIES THAT REPORT INTO OUR MANDATORY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM. WITH THE TOOL ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN ZOOM IN AND EXAMINE EMISSIONS WITHIN A COMMUNITY. THE EMISSIONS DATA CONTAINED IN THIS POLLUTION MAPPING TOOL IS EXPANDED AND RESPONSE TO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND NOW CONTAINS AN ESTIMATE OF ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS. CRITERIA AND TOXIC EMISSIONS FOR EACH FACILITY. THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DATA COLLECTED ANNUALLY THROUGH CARBS MANDATORY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM. THESE -- ADMISSIONS DATA ARE THEN REPORTED BY THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS THIS IS USEFUL DATA BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME WEAKNESSES. FOR EXAMPLE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE USE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES AND DATA COLLECTION FOR REPORTING CRITERIA POLLUTANT AND AIR TOXICS. EVEN FROM THE SAME SOURCES. ADDITIONALLY SOME FACILITIES MAY REPORT CRITERIA POLLUTANTS EVERY THREE YEARS BECAUSE OF AIR DISTRICT REPORTING THRESHOLDS AND AIR TOXIC EMISSIONS EVERY FOUR YEARS BASED ON REQUIREMENTS FROM THE STATE'S AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT HOT SPOTS PROGRAM. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DISTRICTS TO HARMONIZE REPORTING METHODS AS WELL AS THE REPORTING RECORD FREQUENCY AS PART OF THE A. B. IX SEVENTEEN PROCESS. AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT LATER STILL THE POLLUTION MAPPING TOOL CAN HELP COMMUNITIES TRACK EMISSION TRENDS FROM FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND COMPARE THEM WITH EACH OTHER. THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE STARTED COLLECTING GREENHOUSE DATA WAS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SINCE THEN SOME FACILITIES HAVE SEEN EMISSIONS INCREASES AS CALIFORNIA GREW OUT OF THE RECESSION WHILE OTHERS HAVE SEEN REDUCTIONS. AND WE'RE LOOKING IN THE STATE THAT YOU CAN SEE EMISSIONS VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOR INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES WHICH IS NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY REASONS ECONOMIC TECHNICAL AND REGULATORY THAT INFLUENCE AND FACILITIES EMISSIONS IN A PARTICULAR YEAR. THAT YOU CAN NOTE THAT EMISSIONS FROM THE STATION FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE LIMITS BY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. RECENTLY THE STATE OF UP HAD THE STATE HAS UPDATED THESE TRENDS FIRM 200-082-2000 SEVENTEEN AND THEY'RE ALSO WORKING ON WAYS TO DISPLAY EMISSIONS FROM VEHICLES IN ADDITION TO THE MAJOR FACILITIES BY EARLY NEXT YEAR. WE HAVE FOUND THAT ONE OF THE USES OF THIS TOOL IS TO HELP INFORM COMMUNITY EFFORTS LIKE THOSE UNDER AB. SIX SEVENTEEN AND TO HELP THE PUBLIC BETTER UNDERSTAND EMISSIONS FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES THAT MAY BE IMPACTING A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY AND TO PRIORITIZE WHERE MORE ACTION IS NEEDED. WE EXPECT THIS TOOL WILL CONTINUE TO BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE AS WE ADD MORE SOURCES IN THE FUTURE. ENHANCE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER A. B. SIXTEEN AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY ACTION PLANS WILL ALSO HELP PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY REGARDING EMISSIONS AS WELL AS TO TO DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE MOST IMPACT. IMPACTED. NOW AS I MENTIONED OUR EXISTING WORK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS GOING TO BE EXPANDING IN NEW WAYS BECAUSE AB. SIX SEVENTEEN AB SIX SEVENTEEN IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION ADDRESSING CRITERIA POLLUTANT AND TALKS AND TOXIC EMISSIONS SINCE THE ORIGINAL AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT WAS PASSED IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. THIS LEGISLATION FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING AIR QUALITY ISSUES IN OUR MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. AB SIX SEVENTEEN REQUIRES CARP TO DEVELOP A STATE STRATEGY THAT OUTLINES MEASURES TO FURTHER REDUCE CRITERIA POLLUTANT AN AIR TOXIC EMISSIONS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY MONITORING GUIDANCE AND REQUIRE ENHANCED EMISSIONS REPORTING FROM STATIONARY SOURCES. THE BILL RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THE STATE HAS SEEN TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT IN AIR QUALITY THERE ARE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THOSE THAT MAY MENTION THAT ARE NEAR FREIGHT FACILITIES. AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE NEAR FREEWAYS THAT REMAIN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY POOR AIR QUALITY. AND THESE COMMUNITIES REQUIRES SPECIAL ATTENTION AND ACTION. AS CAR MOVES FORWARD WITH AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPROVING THE EMISSIONS INVENTORY WILL BE A KEY COMPONENT OF ALL OF OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES. WITH INCREASING FOCUS ON DATA QUALITY TIMELINESS ACCESSIBILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. SO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND AB SIX SEVENTEEN WORK HAND IN HAND TO SUPPORT FOCUSED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN OUR MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES OVER THE COMING YEARS. THIS IS WHY THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT NEW FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH ALONG WITH EXISTING LAW CAN LOOK AT THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE IMPACTED THESE COMMUNITIES. NOW. THAT WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRANS AND REPORTING IS I'D ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAM AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CLIMATE CHANGE SCOPING PLAN. THE PLAN WAS. TO WITH A PUBLIC PROCESS AND LEGISLATIVE INPUT OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS THE PLAN WAS UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE BOARD. AND THE STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT FOR ITS APPROVAL WAS OVERWHELMING. WE ARE NOW WORKING ON THE STATE'S THIRD SCOPING PLAN AND WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SINCE ADOPTION OF THE FIRST PLAN BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AGAIN YOUR HAND OUTS FOR TODAY SHOW HOW THE ECONOMY AND POPULATION. CONTINUED TO GROW LAW GHG GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CONTINUE TO DECLINE KEEPING US ON TRACK TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET. IMPORTANTLY WE'RE ON TRACK TO MEET OUR A. THIRTY TWO TARGET OF NINETY REACHING NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY. TWENTY TWENTY I TWENTY SIXTEEN LEVELS FELL BELOW THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET FOUR YEARS EARLIER THAN MANDATED BY STATUTE. AND OF COURSE THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT SETS US UP WELL FOR THE NEXT DECADE WE WILL NEED EVEN STEEPER REDUCTION. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY HAD ASSUMED THAT REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MUST ACCOMPANY REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS. BUT OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS PROVED THAT TO BE FALSE. CALIFORNIA IS DEMONSTRATING TO THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN DE COUPLE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH REALLY MEANS YOU CAN GROW USING LESS ENERGY TO DO IT AB LESS POLLUTION. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN CONTINUES THIS APPROACH USING A MIX OF REGULATIONS INCENTIVES AS WELL AS THE MARKET BASED MECHANISM. THAT PUTS A CAP ON EMISSIONS AND ALLOWS FOR ALLOWANCE TRADING TO ACHIEVE OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. USING A COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF STRATEGIES AS DESCRIBED IN THE SCOPING PLAN. BUILD ON OUR SUCCESS OVER THE LAST DECADE. IN ADDITION TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SEVERAL STRATEGY THE SCOPING PLAN WERE DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO MEET FEDERAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS IN OUR STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. AND TO REDUCE TOXICS EMISSIONS IN THE SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT STRATEGY SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT TRIPLE THREAT. STRATEGY INCLUDES PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THAT ARE DELIVERING CLEANER FUELS AND ENERGY. THE ADVANCE CLEAN CARS PROGRAM WHICH IS PUT MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION CLEAN VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. AND THE SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT ACTION PLAN WHICH WILL RESULT IN EFFICIENT AND CLEANER SYSTEMS TO MOVE GOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATES. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS A PART OF THE PACKAGE WITH OTHER MEASURES. IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO MEET OUR GOALS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ACHIEVING THE CO BENEFIT OF IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AS A RESULT OF DIRECT INVESTMENT OF DOLLARS. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSCORES CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE. AGAIN ON THE ISSUE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO NOTE THAT OF THE THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. ASKED SPENT AS OF DECEMBER THAT WERE DESIGNED TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT. DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SO SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF. SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN WE'VE MODIFIED AN ADOPTED SEVERAL OF OUR PLANS AND REGULATIONS. TO ASSURE THE EARLY AND LONG TERM CERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES TO PLAN AND INVESTED IN EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AFFECTS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAR VOTED TO SET GREENHOUSE GAS PLANNING TARGETS FOR THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR AND UTILITIES AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. WE VOTED TO STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND OUR REGULATIONS FOR VEHICLES CLEAN FEELS AS WELL AS THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND HER SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS SUCH AS METHANE WE'VE ADOPTED NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH GLOBAL WARMING GASES THAT ARE USED IN REFRIGERATION AND FOAM. SO WITH ALL OF THESE PLANS AND REGULATIONS WE NEED TO MONITOR AND TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. TO SEE HOW IS ACTUALLY WORKING IN ADDITION TO THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT TO COLLECT REAL WORLD INFORMATION ABOUT. NOT ONLY HOW WE'RE DOING BUT HOW WE COULD BE DOING BETTER NOW WE COULD MAKE CORRECTIONS MIDWAY AS NEEDED. ONE MAJOR DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL SUPPORT AYE MANDATES UNDER AB EIGHT ONE NINETY SEVEN IS THE DEVELOP A DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STATEWIDE STATIONARY SOURCE. EMISSIONS A NEW EMISSIONS REPORTING REGULATIONS THEY'VE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS INDUSTRY GROUPS AND PUBLIC HEALTH GROUPS OVER THE PAST YEAR. TO DEVELOP THIS REGULATION WHICH IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF BEING FINALIZED. IN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEENTH THE CARDBOARD ALSO APPROVED THE REGULATION FOR REPORTING OF CRITERIA AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. THIS REGULATION REQUIRES ANNUAL REPORTING TO KERR. OF CRITERIA POLLUTANT AND TOXIC CONTAMINANT ADMISSIONS. FROM SPECIFIED FACILITIES AND I REALIZE THIS MAY SOUND LIKE IT'S OBVIOUS BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THERE IS NO PLACE ELSE THAT WE ARE AWARE OF WHERE YOU CAN TAKE A PARTICULAR FACILITY. AND FIND IN ONE PLACE THE DATA ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMISSIONS THEY HAVE BEEN THREE SEPARATE PROGRAMS FOR MANY MANY YEARS BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS REALLY COLLECTING. THE DATA AND LOOKING AT IT IN A MORE COHERENT AND COMPREHENSIVE WAY WHICH WE THINK WILL ALSO HELP US. DEVELOP BETTER AT SOLUTIONS TO HOW TO BRING EMISSIONS DOWN EVEN FURTHER. SO -- THIS REGULATION -- OBVIOUSLY WAS DESIGNED -- TO ADDRESS THE LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT BUT AGAIN IT ALSO SUPPORTS THE CARBS NEEDS FOR A BETTER INVENTORY TO USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL AND MANY OTHER PROGRAMS COULD BENEFIT FROM MORE. COMPREHENSIVE AND UPDATED EMISSIONS INVENTORIES AS WELL. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR AIR TOXIC CONTROL MEASURES IN THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN LAYOUT PROCESS SEES TO ADDRESS MITIGATION IN AREAS THAT EXCEED THE FEDERAL STATE FEDERAL AND STATE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. AND THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW TENANTS OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE EMISSIONS INVENTORY ON STATIONARY SOURCES AT THE LOCAL AND SUB COUNTY LEVEL ON OUR WEBSITE. SO THE REGULATION IS GOING TO REQUIRE -- MAJOR ACT ACTIVITY MAJOR EFFORT BUT IT IS WORTH IT IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WILL ALLOW US TO DO -- GOING FORWARD. SO -- I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT REALLY THE BIGGEST STRATEGIES -- IN THE TRY TO WIND UP HERE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND PRESUMABLY ALL HAVE QUESTIONS AS WELL. BUT TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL ISSUES OF AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE THERE IMPACTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE SECTOR THAT STANDS OUT AS OUR BIGGEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS OVERWHELMING ALL OTHERS IS TRANSPORTATION. IT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT HALF OF ALL OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND 90% OF THE HOT TOXIC DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS. AND THE LARGEST EMISSIONS SOURCES INCLUDING TRUCKS TRAINS AND SHIPS ARE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BE CONTROLLED IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET OUR REDUCTION GOALS. WE HAVE TO TAKE IN OUR OVERALL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. OUR APPROACH TO REDUCING EMISSIONS IN THIS SECTOR INCLUDES NEW TECHNOLOGIES FUELS AS WELL AS SPENDING. DOLLARS -- TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES -- FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF CLEANER -- TECHNOLOGIES AND ALSO INCLUDES SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS IS IN SUSTAINABLE LAND USE PLANNING BUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SUCCESS IN THE SECTOR DEPENDS ON SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL. I THINK AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC IS IN THE BUSINESS OF DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLEAN AIR. BETWEEN DISBANDING THE FEDERAL CLIMATE ADVISORY PANEL. RESCINDING THE CLEAN POWER PLAN COURT ACTIONS TO ROLL BACK FEDERAL LAWS AND POTENT SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS REDUCTION STRATEGIES AS WELL AS WITHDRAWING FROM. OUR INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE AGREEMENT. EVERY MONTH BRINGS ANOTHER ALARMING ROLL BACK OF FEDERAL POLICIES THAT HAVE. PROVIDED THE UNDER GIRDING FOR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR ALL THESE YEARS. CALIFORNIA THEREFORE IS LOOKED TO BY OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES -- TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY NOT ONLY AS A LIVING EXAMPLE OF HOW TO REDUCE EMISSIONS WHILE CONTINUING TO GROW A THRIVING ECONOMY BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE THE IMPETUS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION. THE STATE HAS TO LOOK FORWARD I HAD OF ANY PARTICULAR ELECTION CYCLE AND ANY PARTICULAR ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON AND THE HERE AS A STEADY SOURCE. OF GUIDANCE INTO THE FUTURE. HOWEVER WE ARE -- CLEARLY RECOGNIZING THE DANGER FROM WHAT'S GOING ON IN WASHINGTON. AND IT'S A THREAT NOW DIRECTLY TO ATTACK THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ADOPT MORE STRINGENT. STANDARDS PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAIVERS THAT WE'VE ENJOYED FOR STRICTER CAR STANDARDS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR WAIVERS -- OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE LITIGATED WE HAVE ADVOCATED WE HAVE HAD GOVERNOR'S VISIT WASHINGTON EVERY TIME THERE WAS A THREAT -- BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE BEEN. IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT A WAIVER WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN GRANTED FOR ADOPTING THAT PAVLEY STANDARDS THAT DEAL WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WAS GOING TO BE -- ACTUALLY WITH TO DRAW ON AND SO WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD AND HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE'VE BEEN JOINED NOW BY TWENTY THREE OTHER STATES AND HAWAII AND I'M AND TO PUT A RICO -- AS A ADVOCATES -- FOR FOR US BLOCKING THIS ACTION AT NOT TO MENTION MANY -- BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS AND NGOS AS WELL. WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN IT COMES TO CALIFORNIA'S VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS WE ARE BEING ATTACKED AT THE VERY HEART OF OUR PROGRAM. IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO SET EMISSION STANDARDS WE WOULD CERTAINLY FIGHT VIGOROUSLY AND AT THE END WE WOULD FIND A WAY IS -- TO CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS AS EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE AS OUR AS WE HAVE FOUND -- IN IN ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY FOR CONTROLLING MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSIONS SO -- OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE THESE EMISSIONS -- IS REALLY IN THE BALANCE AND COULD BE IMPAIRED -- pWOULD LIKE -- TO VITE YOUR QUESTIONS AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER -- TO BUILD ON THE COULD WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE OVER MANY YEARS AND AND TO MOVE ON TO A EVEN BETTER DAYS. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND SO I DO YOU WANT TO ADD A KNOWLEDGE THAT -- WHEN AB? ONE MAYBE SEVEN WAS PASSED WE WERE PLAYING MORE OFFENSE UNLESS DEFENSE I AND SO I AM AWARE NOT JUST IN THIS BUT JUST IN GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT A LOT OF OUR ENERGIES. ARE GOING TOWARDS A DEFENSE RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S THE CALIFORNIA EMISSION STANDARDS OR A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK ON THE ENVIRONMENT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND SO I KNOW THAT. OUR ENERGIES ARE PRETTY TAX AND AND PRETTY SPLIT RIGHT NOW. WITH THAT BUT I DID WANT TO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT MORE -- WE ARE ON A PATHWAY. TO MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY G. H. T. ROLES -- THAT. HELP MOTIVATE. THE EXPANSION OF AB -- THIRTY TWO AND TOWARDS YOUR GOALS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY AND SO WANTED. TO I GUESS HEAR YOUR OPINION I'VE READ A COUPLE OF THINGS ALONG THE WAY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE ON ON TRACK TO TO MEET THOSE GOALS FOR WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU DIRECTLY OF WAITING FOR AT MOVING TOWARDS OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. SO WE DID HIT THE TWENTY TWENTY GOAL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT OF COURSE -- ONE YEAR ADD DATA DOESN'T NECESSARILY HOLD INTO THE FUTURE -- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC TRENDS AS I MENTIONED BUT ALSO WEATHER CONDITIONS AND OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE PROGRESS THAT WE STARTED -- I THINK IN TERMS OF MOVING TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE WITH A MIX OF TOOLS. THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US TODAY -- WE'RE DOING WELL ON A RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WERE SEEING -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TAKING INITIATIVES ON THE LAND USE FROM TO TRY -- TO USE THEIR RESOURCES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND TO HELP WITH -- USING -- SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE -- THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION FUND TO BUILD MORE LIVABLE COMMUNITIES EXPAND TRANSIT AND WALKING AND BIKING OPPORTUNITIES -- WE ARE TAKING A WHOLE NEW LOOK AT INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES AND WHAT CAN BE DONE -- LOOKING AT BUILDINGS WHERE WE HAVE DONE A LOT IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THEM EFFICIENT BUT WE STILL -- BURN A LOT OF NATURAL GAS AND HEATING WATER AND HEATING BUILDINGS AND THAT IS A BIG SOURCE OF INDOOR AIR POLLUTION AS WELL AS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- WE'RE LOOKING AT TO AGRICULTURE WHICH HAS -- HAS BEEN OVER THE YEARS A MAJOR SOURCE OF SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS TO SEE WHERE WE CAN -- FIND WAYS TO MAKE SOME BIG GAINS THERE IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND ALSO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AT THE SAME TIME SO CAR IS BEEN GOING SORT OF SECTOR BY SECTOR -- LOOKING AROUND TO SEE WHERE WE CAN TIGHTEN THINGS UP AND WHERE WE CAN DO BETTER -- BUT OVERALL I THINK THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY WE BELIEVE THAT THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED ARE AVAILABLE IT'S WHEN WE LOOK TOWARDS TWENTY FIFTY M. OUR GOAL OF BECOMING -- CARBON NEUTRAL OR AND THAT IS NOT ADMITTING ANYTHING THAT WE SEE THE AREAS WHERE WE FRANKLY DON'T KNOW YET HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. WE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DO A LOT MORE TO MAKE OUR FORESTS -- AND OUR LAND -- STORE MORE CARBON EFFECTIVELY AND BECOME A NET SINK INSTEAD OF A SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO CAPTURE CARBON LITERALLY IN THE AIR AND TO FIND WAYS. TO RE USE IT FOR BENEFICIAL PURPOSES OR PERMANENTLY -- NEUTRALIZE IT THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED THAT ARE BEING WORKED ON BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE THE PLANS IN PLACE AND THE TOOLS. TO MAKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN AND WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO AB ADVANCE THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND IN A NUMBER OF THESE AREAS. SO THEN WHEN -- THERE IS THERE'S A A QUOTE WERE YOU PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT. THE STRATEGIES WE USE UNTIL NOW HAVEN'T BEEN EFFECTIVE THAN THIS WOULD FALL INTO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE WERE TRANSFERRED OUT WITH THOSE TOOLS WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD -- SO THAT WOULD BE A FIRM TO PETITION. YES I MEAN I THINK THAT THINGS LIKE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE. KIND OF SETTLED IN AS PART OF EXPECTATIONS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS AND THAT THE REGULATED INDUSTRY HAS THAT THOSE WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND THAT WILL CONTINUE -- TO RATCHET DOWN ON THE ON THE AD LIMITS THAT US FACILITIES CAN CAN HAVE -- AND THAT PEOPLE ARE FINDING WAYS NOW INTERNALLY WITHIN THEIR FACILITIES TO REDUCE THEIR EMISSIONS AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT THE WHAT THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED. TO ACCOMPLISH. SO WE KNOW THAT. BOTH DATA AND ON MY ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE GOING HOME EVERY WEEKEND. THAT WE HAVE -- INCREASED EMISSIONS FROM. OMAR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHETHER IT'S THE TRUCKS ARE THE FREIGHT AND I HAVE THE LUXURY OF HAVING THE FREEWAYS THE RAILYARDS THE POOR -- AND THEN THE STATIONARY SOURCES ALSO AND AND MIKE BACKYARD SO HEAVILY IMPACTED COMMUNITY THERE AND WE WE FEEL IT WITH THE ADDITIONAL TRUCKS ON THE ROAD. THERE HAVE BEEN EFFICIENCIES AT THE PORT OF LONG BEACH THAT ARE ADDING MORE TRUCKS ALSO AND SO WHILE THE PORT ITSELF MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT GREENER THE TRUCKS THAT ARE. ON THE FREEWAYS ARE NOT GREEN ARROW AND WE'RE ADDING MANY MORE TRAXXAS HAS GOOD MOVEMENTS HAS INCREASED AND IT'S TIED TO OUR MARKET. TO EAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE AN INCREASE ON TRANSPORTATION -- AND FOR TRANSPORTATION SOURCES OUT THERE. WHAT ARE ORDER THOSE TRENDS MEAN TO YOU AS FAR AS G. C. TARGETS IN AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW IT THAT'S BEEN ONE OF MY BIG PUSH OF GOING FROM REGIONAL TO TO LOCAL? I. SELFISHLY BECAUSE I LIVE THEIR LIVES SURE I MEAN IT EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES THESE THINGS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHETHER YOU'RE IN AN AFFLUENT OR A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BUT IN PARTICULAR IF YOU'RE IN A COMMANDING THE THIS IMPACTED BY GOODS MOVEMENT -- YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU ARE TWIN OF THAT ABSOLUTELY MOST IMPACTED YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE EXPERIENCING WAVES OF TRAFFIC AND AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE AND IT HAS HEALTH. IMPACTS AS WELL SO -- HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT YOUR DISTRICT I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SCHOOLS AND HOMES THAT ARE YOU KNOW VERY CLOSE TO WHERE THESE FACILITIES ARE. AND WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO MOVE FASTER I THINK A AND CUT DEEPER FRANKLY I MEAN THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE TO DATE. IS NOT ENOUGH -- THIS YEAR AS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON GETTING AN INSPECTION PROGRAM FOR TRUCKS BECAUSE OF WE CAN ADOPT A REGULATION THAT'S WELL AND GOOD. BUT THE RATE OF NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS IN THAT SECTOR IN PARTICULAR IS VERY HIGH -- THERE WERE CERTAIN NUMBER OF OF FLEETS ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE LARGER FLEETS WHERE -- YOU KNOW THEY CAN AFFORD TO PUT NEW EQUIPMENT ON AND BUY NEW EQUIPMENT -- AND THEY DO THAT PRETTY RAPIDLY OTHERS THAT ARE SMALLER -- ARE REALLY OFTENTIMES DELAYING OR AVOIDING -- ANY KIND OF COMPLIANCE AND SO THIS YEAR IS GONNA BE A BIG YEAR. FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WILL BE OWNERS OF TRUCKS THAT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REGISTER THEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T MET. THE CURRENT -- REQUIREMENTS FOR UPGRADING THEIR FACILITIES AND SO WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE TRYING TO EDUCATE AND ADVOCATE AND MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF LOAN PROGRAMS THAT EXIST AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S STILL -- HI I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE AT A SIGNIFICANT OUTCRY. IN SOME QUARTERS WHEN PEOPLE FIND THAT -- THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT IN COMPLIANCE AND THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. TO OPERATE OUT OF COMPLIANCE AS THAT THAT THE BOOM WILL GET WILL GET LOWERED BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT FACTOR OF COURSE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE COMPLYING THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEIR OPERATIONS UNDER CUT BY SOMEBODY WHO CAN GET AWAY WITH YOU KNOW. NOT PAYING THE PRICE FOR PUTTING ON UPDATED ADEQUATE MEANT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUTURE AND THE CONTINUED -- OPERATION OF OUR LOGISTICS COMMUNITIES OF OUR PORTS AND THE THE THROUGH PUT THAT WE HAVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE TOWARDS ZERO EMISSION FREIGHT WHICH REALLY MEANS. ELECTRIFICATION OF THE WHOLE FREIGHT QUARTERS AND WHEN WE START SPENDING MONEY TO UPGRADE THOSE FACILITIES ARE WHEN WE SEE PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE LOOKING TOWARDS. MUCH MUCH MORE -- ZERO THAT THAN WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. SO -- YOU SORRY TO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE STRATEGIES TO TRY TO MOVE FASTER AND DEEPER AND AND YOU GAVE US THE EXAMPLE SHORT TERM. WHAT THE TRUCKS AND YOU GIVE US THE EXAMPLE LONG TERM WITH ELECTRIFICATION OF THE RAILWAY -- AND CITING THOSE ARE GOOD. OF STARTING AND ENDING POINT FOCUSES FOR MY NEXT QUESTION OF WHAT'S WHAT'S IN THE IN BETWEEN WHAT ARE SOME ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND THIS -- MOBILE -- SECTOR PIECE WHETHER IT'S CARS TRUCKS -- RATES. OUR PLANES I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE SOME WHAT ARE SOME OTHER THINGS IN IN THE INNER -- BECAUSE IN IN THE SHORT TERM -- THE TRUCKS. HAVING TO HAVE. BEEN COMPLAINTS AGAINST REGISTRATION I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BEING FAST ENOUGH DEEP ENOUGH RIGHT AND SO WHAT ELSE ARE WE GOING TO BE DOING IN THERE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU. THAT AIR BE THROUGH THE STATE OR THROUGH OTHER AVENUES IS STARTING TO LOOK INTO SHORT IN THE INTERIM. SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH REGIONAL AIR DISTRICTS I HAD -- TO FINDING WAYS TO BRING WAREHOUSES AND OTHER STATIONARY FACILITIES. IN TO THE INTO THE STATUS OF TAKING RESPONSIBILITY -- FOR MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ATTRACTING AND USING THE CLEANEST POSSIBLE EQUIPMENT -- WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO NOT SITE FACILITIES IN PLACES WHERE THEY WILL -- BE CAUSING UNDUE IMPACT ON THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES -- GETTING MORE EFFICIENT ABOUT THE WAY THAT WAY MOVE GOODS AROUND WHICH REALLY REQUIRES A MUCH CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCIES AND A MORE -- COHERENT -- LOOK AT HOW WE SPEND OUR TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT AS AS WE TRY TO DO WITH OUR REGULATIONS THAT WE ARE GETTING AS MUCH BANG AS POSSIBLE OUT OF EVERY BUCK THAT THE STATE IS PAYING. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING UTILIZED. FOR MAKING FACILITIES GREENER AND HEALTHIER AT THE SAME TIME AND THERE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE IN WOULD SEEING DEMONSTRATIONS NOW OF SOME OF THOSE IDEAS OUT THERE IN THE REAL WORLD. SOME OF THEM ARE JUST ON THE DRAWING BOARDS AT THE MOMENT BUT IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST AND ACTIVITY I WOULD SAY AND THE GOVERNOR I KNOW HAS SPOKEN ON THIS TOPIC IN TERMS OF WARNING HIS TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES -- TO PLAY A MORE -- ACTIVE AND PROACTIVE ROLE IN LEADING ON SOME OF THESE. ARE THERE EXAMPLES RIGHT NOW OF HELLO -- THE STATE AIR BE AT THEIR TO THE STATE OR THROUGH THE LOCAL -- DISTRICTS. IS STARTING TO ENGAGE IN THOSE TRANSPORTATION WITH THE STRUCTURE TATIAN AGENCIES OR THE LAND USE AGENCIES. CURRENTLY. YOU KNOW -- THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT PASSED AND I WAS ARE FORGOTTEN THE BILL NUMBER BUT THERE WAS A A REQUIREMENT THAT WAS PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. THAT -- THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAVE TO MEET TOGETHER SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE -- AND THE FIRST TIME OR TWO THAT WE MET FRANKLY IT WAS PRETTY AWKWARD BECAUSE WE OPERATE VERY DIFFERENTLY ARE -- OUR APPROACH TO ISSUES IS DIFFERENT THEY HAND OUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WITH WHICH IS GREAT -- BUT DON'T REGULATE AND THEY YOU KNOW. BASICALLY TAKE PROJECTS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO THEM AND ACT ON THEM WHEREAS AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WHERE MORE AND IN THE BUSINESS OF DEVISING. REGULATIONS AND SENDING THEM OUT INTO THE WORLD SO THERE WERE CULTURAL. DIFFERENCES BUT THE LAST TIME WE MET -- WE MET DOWN IN -- SAN DIEGO AREA TO TALK ABOUT A COMMON CONCERN WHICH IS THE FOR THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO ROLL BACK. VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS BECAUSE THAT ACTION COULD THROW OUR REGION'S OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT THEY WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY'RE TRANSPORTATION PLANS -- ARE IN CONFORMITY WITH THEIR AIR PLANS AND SO TOGETHER -- WE HAVE BEEN OUT EDUCATING PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY ACTIVE -- IN CONGRESS BY EDUCATING THEIR MEMBERS ABOUT THE FACT THAT. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING THIS IS ALSO WHAT ABOUT AIR POLLUTION IF THE IF THE VEHICLES ARE NOT. MEANING THESE EMISSIONS STANDARDS IT WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF UNDERCUTTING OUR ABILITY TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS SO -- THIS IS NOW A THREAT TO CONSTRUCTION IT'S A THREAT TO ACT YOU KNOW ONGOING ACTIVITIES THAT PROGRAM FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS AND SO -- WE'RE NOW AT A MUCH MORE. ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION THAN WE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE BETWEEN THE AIR AND THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES AND I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO DO MORE. WHEN WHEN WAS THAT LAST MEETING? I WAS JUST A MONTH OR SO AGO. THE SOFT LITTLE START TO TRICKLE DOWN TO THE LOCAL FOLKS IN -- THERE'S I MEAN I WILL SAY THAT. I GO HOME AND AND WHILE WE I HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE IN THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN WORK THAT WE AND THE BILL WE PASSED WITH THAT AB. THREE NINETY EIGHT I HAD A SURE SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITH MY CONSTITUENTS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH FAST ENOUGH -- WHETHER OR NOT IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE GETTING OR NOT GETTING FROM CAPITATED IS WORTH IT IS WORTH THE TRADE OFF. I AND AND THAT'S A QUESTION THAT TIME GOING TO BE ANSWERED ANYTIME SOON RIGHT WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE. WHAT THE DATA TELLS US? ALONG THE WAY BUT IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT THING WITH THE SENTIMENT OF OF WHETHER WERE INTRACTABLE -- TWENTY THIRTY HOLD HER TWENTY FIFTY GOALS AND AND THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS YET. THERE'S A DISCUSSION OF MAYBE WE DO HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD THE POLITICAL WILL TO USE THEM -- THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT INDIRECT SOURCE RULES -- ACROSS THE STATE IN SOME REGIONS ARE MORE OPEN TO THAT THAN THAN OTHERS -- WE TALK ABOUT WAREHOUSES RIGHT AND HAVING THEM BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND THEIR ROLE OF WITHIN THEIR ACCESS RULES AS THEY ARE THESE MAGNETS. OUT THERE OR THE FAILURE TO HAVE A RAIL YARD WITH TWO OPERATOR SOMEONE THAT TURNS AWAY TRUCKS THAT ARE NOT. IN COMPLIANCE AND ONE THAT JUST SENT TO LIST TO THEIR DISTRICT AND I'M NOT SURE HOW HOW GREAT OF A STRATEGY THAT IS RIGHT AND HOW DO WE GET THEM TO ACTUALLY MAYBE TURN AWAY AND DO THEIR PART THAT WAY -- AND SO I THINK WE KNOW THAT WHERE WERE NOT. ON TRACK FOR THE LONG TURNS OF TWENTY FIFTY GOALS BUT THERE IS THAT QUESTION OF DO WE HAVE TOOLS OUT THERE THAT WE MAYBE. SHOULD BE IS AND HAVING BEEN USING TO GET US ON TRACK AND MAYBE GET US ON TRACK QUICKER AND SOMEBODY'S COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE MOST IMPACTED -- DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINIONS ON THAT. WELL IT YOU KNOW IT IT'S SO BUT IT'S GREAT TO BE. AT A POINT NOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE ASKING EVEN SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE HAVING STARTED WORK AS THAT. ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATE BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN WE WERE SUING TO BLOCK NEW FREEWAY IS THAT WERE BEING PLANNED -- TO GO THROUGH LOW INCOME COMMUNITY ACCESS THAT'S WHERE THE LAND WAS THE CHEAPEST AND NO CONSIDERATION OF TRANSIT AS A ALTERNATIVE TO JUST TRYING TO BUILD MORE AND MORE LANES OF FREEWAYS. IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME -- TO GET CALIFORNIA I THINK TO THINK OF ITSELF AS A PLACE WHERE WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT MORE DENSITY -- IN THAT USED TO BE SORT OF A DIRTY WORD THERE WAS AT ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCACY GROUP IN LA WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING THERE CALLED. NOT YET NEW YORK AND THEIR GOAL IN LIFE WAS TO PREVENT APARTMENT BUILDINGS FROM BEING BUILT IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE FORMERLY ONLY YEAH YOU KNOW SINGLE STORY -- COMMUNITY SO -- WE'RE CHANGING OUR IDEAS I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE OF WHAT'S DESIRABLE. AND IT'S NOT COMING ONLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR AIR QUALITY CERTAINLYOR FOR A CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IT THESE THINGS DO WORK TOGETHER THE FACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE NOW SO. VISIBLE AN OBVIOUS AROUND OUR STATE. MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR MAYBE MORE RADICAL SOLUTIONS AT LEAST WILLING TO CONSIDER THEM. AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR THOSE KINDS SOLUTIONS. WE SHOULD BE DOING IT THOUGH NOT JUST YOU KNOW AS A RB BUT REALLY ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT TO WHEREVER. WE HAVE EITHER MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING OR WAY IS THAT WHERE. ENABLING OF PRACTICES TO CONTINUE THAT ARE UNHEALTHY WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO TURN THAT AROUND AND I'M. EXCITED THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT. YEAH AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE -- THAT WE'RE THERE YET ON ON THE DENSITY. BUT WE HAVE MEMBERS ARE STARTING TO ASK THE QUESTION AT LEAST A LEGISLATURE THAT'S BEING INTRODUCED. ARE AROUND THAT -- I MEAN AND SO YOU REFERENCE -- HE SAID THAT NOTS IS THERE BE BUT OTHER AGENCIES OR OTHER AREAS WILL WHAT WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES YOU HAVE FOR THAT. WELL I MEAN EVEN WITH AND CAL EPA IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT YOU KNOW WE COULD BE WORKING MUCH MORE CLOSELY THAN WE USED TO IN THE PAST WITH THE WITH THE INTEGRATED WASTE. FOLKS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING EVER REALLY JUST BECOMES A WASTE OF THAT WE RE USE OR FIND WAYS TO AVOID TO THROWING AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. THINGS -- THAT OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ENERGY AND BECAUSE POLLUTION IF THEY IF THEY ARE WASTE AND A SO A BIG PART OF THE ANSWER -- TO MEETING ARE VERY TOUGH. GOALS REALLY HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR WAYS BETTER IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR HOW TO MANAGE WASTE IN OUR SOCIETY -- THERE'S A LOT OF TALK NOW ABOUT FOOD AND HOW IT'S PRODUCED AND HOW IT IS -- BROUGHT TO MARKET AND JUST RECENTLY WE BEGAN WORKING WITH THE CALLIE PA OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD. CULTURE ON A PROGRAM IN WHICH PEOPLE WHO EAT OUT IN RESTAURANTS CAN -- PAY A TINY AMOUNT EXTRA ON THEIR TRACK AND HAVE THAT MONEY GO BACK -- TO FARMS TO PAY -- FOR PEOPLE TO USE THE METHODOLOGIES FOR FARMING THAT PRODUCE LESS EMISSIONS AND TO ENGAGE IN OUT THINGS LIKE WHAT THEY CALLED NO TILL AGRICULTURE WERE YOU AVOID -- RELEASING RELEASING CARBON THAT STORED IN THE SOIL BUT IT COSTS MORE MONEY FOR THE FARMERS TO DO IT SO IT'S A IT'S A KIND OF A VIRTUOUS CIRCLE INSTEAD OF A VICIOUS CIRCLE TO DO SOMETHING. LIKE THAT WHERE PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN HELPING TO MAKE THE FOOD PRODUCTION PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT AND THERE'S THERE'S JUST A LOT OF IDEAS LIKE THAT OUT THERE THAT WE NEED TO BE. LOOKING AT AND FINDING WAYS TO IMPLEMENT. OKAY -- I'M GOING. TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT -- US. SECTION OF OF TODAY BECAUSE THEY DO WANT TO TRY TO KEEP US ON SCHEDULE -- THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR TIME I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN BUSY PLANE HOW OFTEN IS OUT THERE AND YOUR TIME IS FOR BETWEEN BEING ERE AND BEING. OUT OF THE OUT OF THE STATE AS I WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT BUT I I DO WANT TO RE ITERATE. THE IMPORTANCE IN THE POWER THAT I FEEL THAT THEY'RE A STATE OR DISTRICT PASSES SOMETIMES PUSHING ALONG OUR LOCAL ARE DISTRICTS. TO MAYBE ARE NOT AS PROGRESSIVE AS WE NEED THEM TO BE HI IN LOOKING AT WAYS BEYONCE'S HANDING OUT MONEY. BUT ALSO USING THE POWER THEY HAVE WITH THE SPICE AND REGULATIONS AND HAVING THE COURAGE TO DO. WHAT'S RIGHT TO WE CAN MOVE FASTER AND DEEPER FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE. BEEN SO UNFAIRLY BURDEN AND CONTINUE TO BE. ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT THE GROWING ECONOMY AROUND THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND I I KNOW THAT'S A DELICATE BALANCE SOME OF THOSE ARE. WE HAVE GOOD JOB SIR THERE ARE IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECONOMY BUT I CAN'T KEEP COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES I GET TREATED LIKE THEIR DISPOSABLE OR THEIR BACKYARDS ARE WASTELANDS AND SO -- I THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE REAL PEOPLE THAT I GO HOME. TO EVERY WEEK -- AND I KEEP TELLING THEM THAT THE MATTER JUST AS MUCH AS THE FOLKS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT US IMPACTED IN. AND HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HELP THEMSELVES THAT WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS BECAUSE THE CLIMATE CHANGE ARE BECAUSE OF POLLUTION. OUT THERE ARE AND SO I HOPE I DO APPRECIATE THE UPDATE I HOPE -- THAT AS YOU DO THE LOCAL WORK AS YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR US OUT THERE -- AT AND AT THE NATIONAL SIDE OF THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO PRESSURE THE LOCAL ARE DISTRICTS TO DO BETTER BY THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM. A COUPLE OF SPEAKERS TODAY ABOUT SOME OF THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND I MAY CHANGE OTHER AFFECTED AND AND HOW THEY'RE AT A BIGGER THIS ADVANTAGE AND IN THESE CRISIS OUT THERE AND HOW WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION. QUICKER AND AND HAVE THE COURAGE HI SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY ADDITIONAL IDEAS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DO YOU IN TO HELP YOU A CHAMPION FOR SOME OF THOSE IDEAS. TO TO MOVE US TOWARD HER TWENTY FIFTY GOALS AND DO IT IN A WAY WHERE WE HELP THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE MOST DISADVANTAGED SOONER THAN LATER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO STICK AROUND IN CASE WE HAVE MORE QUESTIONS LATER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ON INTO NEXT UP WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A THREE PRESS CENTERS PERCENT TO A SIX ARE EXAMPLES OF SIGNIFICANT. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION PEGS IMPACTS ON VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AT WE ARE GOING TO BE STARTING WITH DOCTOR STEPHEN WHEELER PROFESSOR OF THE UNIVERSITY. OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY -- PROFESSOR RULER LET ME GIVE YOU THIS A LITTLE BIT OF ACTUALLY TO FOR A START OKAY -- I THINK YOU FOR MAKING TIME OUT HERE MISTER WHEELER IS A PROFESSOR IN THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN ECOLOGY AT UC DAVIS -- AND HE IS -- HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THREE BOOKS PLANNING FOR SUSTAINABILITY TOWARDS CIVIL EQUITABLE AND ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES I AND HE WILL BE TALKING TO US TODAY ABOUT URBAN COMMUNITY SAID THIS EVENT IS A THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME. YOU HAVE HIS BIO AND THEN SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF THE LEADERSHIP THAT HE'S OUT THERE DOING -- IN THIS AREA BUT I I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME AND I'M EXCITED TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS TODAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I AM NOT GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT MEDICATION ALTHOUGH I AM VERY HAPPY TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THAT LATER I AM INSTEAD GOING TO TALK ABOUT HE IMPACT. ON VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND WAYS TO POSSIBLY REDUCE THOSE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I'VE DONE RESEARCH LOOKING AT URBAN HEAT ISLANDS. IN ARID AND SEMI ARID REGIONS WORLDWIDE. THIS TOPIC IS IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE PLANNING. FOR REASONS THAT I THINK WE ALL KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES WILL GET HOTTER. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HE WILL BE GREATER SOME PLACES THAN OTHERS. AND THEY WILL BE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT STAY WILL THERE WILL BE INCREASED MORTALITY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WILL SUFFER THE MOST BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PUBLIC POLICY PUT IN PLACE NOW. CAN POTENTIALLY REDUCE THESE IMPACTS SOMEWHAT AND DISPARITIES BETWEEN COMMUNITIES. NOW THE PHENOMENON OF URBAN HEAT ISLANDS. HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF PRESS IN THE LAST DECADE THIS IS THE FOR NOT WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA IN WHICH URBAN LANDSCAPES DOMINATED BY. ASPHALT AND ROOFTOPS. HEAT UP DURING THE DAY MORE STRONGLY THAN SURROUNDING RURAL REGIONS.% THIS IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON IT HAS BEEN KNOWN ABOUT SINCE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THERE'S BEEN. ACADEMIC STUDY SINCE NINETEEN SIXTIES. IT HAS INCREASED THOUGH QUITE A BIT AS COMMUNITIES RURAL URBAN REGIONS HAVE GROWN. IN TEMPERATE CLIMATES CITIES CAN BE FIVE TO TEN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT HOTTER ON A WARM SUMMER DAY. THEN SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE. BUT WHAT ISN'T AS WELL KNOWN IS THAT SOME NEIGHBORHOODS WITH IN BOTH CITIES AND SMALLER RURAL TOWNS. WE'LL BE MUCH HOTTER THAN OTHERS. MY OWN WORK HAS FOUND THAT ON A JULY DAY YOU THE HOTTEST BUILT LANDSCAPES WITH IN SACRAMENTO ARE. UP TO NINETY DEGREES HOTTER WARMER DâN COOLEST THE COOLEST NEIGHBORHOODS A PLACE LIKE A LONG FLOOR IN BOULEVARD WILL BE ABOUT. NINE DEGREES HOTTER THAN IN LAND PARK WHICH IS LESS THAN A MILE AWAY. THESE ARE SURFACE TEMPERATURES I SHOULD MENTION AIR TEMPERATURES WILL BE SOMEWHAT LESS OF A DIFFERENCE BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT. RESEARCHERS INITIALLY STUDIED URBAN HEAT ISLANDS IN TEMPERATE CITIES SUCH AS ATLANTA WHICH IS ONE OF THE CLASSIC. CASES. END WHEN YOU HAVE SURROUNDING RURAL AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY FORESTED. THOSE STAY MUCH COOLER THAN THE CITY. MUCH MORE RECENTLY WE AT THOSE OF US IN ACADEMIA HAVE. END RECENT WORK HAS FOUND THAT. HEAT ISLANDS. IN THESE PLACES IS ARE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN FOR TRIAL AND THEN FOR TEMPERATURE. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF VEGETATION DESERT AND OTHER DRY RURAL LANDSCAPES HEAT UP MUCH MORE RAPIDLY DURING THE DAY. ENDS BUT ALSO COOL DOWN MUCH MORE RAPIDLY AT NIGHT STAND DEMONSTRATED FOR EXAMPLE BY MADRID WHICH IS ON THE RIGHT HERE AT THE BLUE OBVIOUSLY ARC IS COOL AND THEN THE LEFT YOU SEE THERE IS WHAT'S CALLED AN URBAN COOL ISLAND DURING THE DAY. AND AT NIGHT WE HAVE AN URBAN HEAT ISLAND -- ENDS THESE PHENOMENA ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY ELEVATION HUMIDITY THE PRESENCE OF MOUNTAINS OCEANS AND OTHER. OTHER THINGS. SINCE URBAN HEAT ISLAND IN ARID REGIONS DO HAVE THIS COMPLEX NATURE. WE MAKES MOST SENSE IN CALIFORNIA TO JUST FOCUS ON HEAT. RATHER THAN HEAT ISLANDS PER SE. EVEN THOUGH HE ISLANDS DOES SOUND LIKE A TRENDY TOPIC. END TO LOOK AT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO REDUCE TEMPERATURES IN THE HOTTEST AND MOST VULNERABLE NEIGHBORHOODS. SO HERE IS A KEEP MAPPING OF THE LA BASIN [inaudible] END. WE CAN SEE THAT SOME AREAS ARE MUCH HARDER THAN OTHERS THE COAST OBVIOUSLY IS USUALLY COOLER. OF WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING PHENOMENA AT NIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A BIT OF A HEAT ISLAND IN THE LONG BEACH AREA. I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS IT COULD BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH PREVAILING WINDS OR NEARBY INDUSTRIAL AREAS OR WHATEVER A BUNCH. OUR GOAL IN THE FUTURE I THINK HE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE TO UNDERSTAND THESE DYNAMICS AND TO NOT JUST DO A ONE DAY MAPPING BUT TO MODEL IT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS THAT ARE REALLY HOTTER. THAN OTHERS IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE AT MOST RISK OF HEAT. TO OVERLAY THAT WITH THE NASCENT NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF POVERTY OR BECAUSE OF PRESENCE OF ELDERLY OR VERY YOUNG POPULATIONS OR OTHER. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THEN DEVELOP STRATEGIES. TO REDUCE THE RISK -- IN SUCH ANALYSES CAN BE DONE FOR BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. SO HE'S HAS PARTICULAR IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS. HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT GOOD AIR CONDITIONING OR EVAPORATIVE COOLERS WHICH IS TO SAY MANY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. HAVE LITTLE RELIEF FROM HIGH TEMPERATURES EVEN AT NIGHT -- PROLONGED HEAT IS HARD ON THE ELDERLY AND OTHERS IN POOR HEALTH LEADING TO INCREASED MORTALITY. PROLONGED HEAT CAN ALSO BE HARD ON THE VERY YOUNG. I SPEAK FROM SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ON THIS SINCE MY DAUGHTER SENT SUFFERED FROM FEBRILE SEIZURES I II CONVULSIONS THAT OCCUR BECAUSE OF HIGH BODY TEMPERATURES. WHICH ARE MOST COMMON BETWEEN SIX MONTHS AND FIVE YEARS OF AGE. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND THREE HEAT WAVE IN FRANCE WHICH IS WHAT THE GRAPH YOUR SHOWS. SOME FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED PREMATURELY AND I THINK THE NUMBER FOR EUROPE AS A WHOLE WAS CLOSER. TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PROBABLY THE CURRENT EUROPEAN HEAT WAVE WILL HAVE SIMILAR RESULTS. AND YOU SEE THE MORTALITY GOES UP OVER TIME IS PEOPLE'S RESILIENCE. WAS DOWN AFTER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF HEAT. TO DATE THERE HAVE BEEN FEW IF ANY NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE STUDIES QUANTIFYING THE DISPROPORTIONATE KEEP RELATED CLIMATE RISK. FACED BY DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. I HOPE TO UNDERTAKE. ONE SUCH STUDY THIS FALL WITH ONE OF MY GRADUATE STUDENTS AND MAYBE NEXT YEAR WE WILL HAVE SOME BETTER DATA. HOWEVER WE DO ALREADY KNOW THAT THESE COMMUNITIES WILL BE VULNERABLE. SO HOW DO WE KEEP CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS COOL. THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE MAIN STRATEGIES. TO MAXIMIZE VEGETATION ESPECIALLY AT LARGE DROUGHT TOLERANT SHADE TREES. TO MAKE SERVICES SUCH AS ROOFS AND PAVING REFLECT RATHER THAN ABSORB HEAT. AND TO USE BUILDING FORM TRELLISES AWNINGS AND OTHER DESIGN STRATEGY. TO PRODUCE SHADE FOR PEOPLE AT GROUND LEVEL. THE STATE CAN PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING ALL THREE STRATEGIES COME ABOUT AND IT ALREADY DOES IN SOME WAY. SO LET'S TAKE THE FIRST OF THOSE. GREENING COMMUNITIES IS NOT SIMPLE IN A DRY CLIMATE. ALTHOUGH THE COOL AIR THROUGH IF APPLE TRANSPIRATION LAWNS ARE USUALLY NOT DESIRABLE SINCE THEY REQUIRE EXTENSIVE IRRIGATION. AND DON'T PRODUCE SHAPE. SHAPE PRODUCING TREES ARE A MUCH BETTER STRATEGY. THE CHALLENGE IS TO IDENTIFY SPECIES. THAT WILL MAXIMIZE SHADING WHILE MINIMIZING WATER USE. END TOLERATING HARSH CONDITIONS THAT OFTEN OCCUR ALONG STREETS AND IN PARKING LOTS. THERE ARE USEFUL DATABASES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED. THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DIVISION OF AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES. THIS CALL THAT WILL CALLS DATABASE DON'T ASK ME TO REMEMBER WHAT IT STANDS -- FOR END THROUGH CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO IT'S CALLED THE SELECT THREE DATABASE. SOME OF THE STATE UTILITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ALSO TAKEN LEADERSHIP IN PROMOTING URBAN FORESTRY. MANY CITIES ARE NOW REQUIRING DEVELOPERS TO PLANT TREES IN PARKING LOTS. SO THAT AT LEAST 50% OF ASPHALT SURFACES WE'LL BE SHADED IN TEN YEARS. CITIES COULD ALSO DEVELOP STREET TREE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD SHAPE STREETS A SIMILAR AMOUNT. AND COULD ADOPT SUBDIVISION CODES FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT. THAT WOULD REQUIRE NARROWER STREETS WITH LESS ASPHALT. AND MORE EXTENSIVE SHADING. POTENTIALLY THE STATE COULD ENCOURAGE OR REQUIRE SUCH STEPS. THE STATE HAS PROVIDED FUNDING THROUGH WHICH URBAN GREENING PROGRAM AND OTHER PROGRAMS. FOR URBAN FORESTRY WHICH COULD BE INCREASED IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. MOVING ON TO THE SECOND TOPIC CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY MADE STRIDES TOWARD REQUIRING COOL ROOFS IN PART DUE TO THE LEADERSHIP OF LATE C. C. COMMISSIONER ART ROSENFELDT. THE STATE'S BUILDING CODE NOW REQUIRES ROOFING MATERIALS TO HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF REFLECTANCE. WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT NECESSARILY MAKING SHINGLES WHITE OR EVEN LIGHT COLORED. STREET SERVICES HAVE NOT RECEIVED SO MUCH ATTENTION. HOWEVER CANOGA PARK IS EXPERIMENTING WITH LIGHT COLORED ASPHALT THAT HAS HIGHER REFLECTANCE. AND THE STATE PERHAPS COULD ACCELERATE EFFORTS ON THIS FRONT AS WELL. THE THIRD STRATEGY USING BUILT FORM. TO CREATE SHADE IS THE LEAST EXPLORED TO DATE. AND LET ME MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LINE. OF MEDITERRANEAN AND LATIN AMERICAN CITIES HAVE USED THE STRATEGY FOR CENTURIES. HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE OFTEN CREATED LOW SPREAD OUT BUILT LANDSCAPES WITH LITTLE IF ANY SHADE FOR PEDESTRIANS. MUNICIPALITIES COULD REQUIRE NEW BUILDINGS PARTICULARLY IN CENTRAL LOCATIONS. TO BE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE STORIES SO THAT THEY CAST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SHADE. AND THE COULD REQUIRE AWNINGS WERE PORTICOS OVERSIGHT WALKS. COURTYARDS ARE ALSO DESIRABLE WITHIN LARGE BUILDINGS. SINCE THEY ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE AT LEAST ONE SIDE IN SHADE AND CREATE RELATIVELY COOL OUTDOOR MICRO CLIMATES FOR BUILDING RESIDENTS. THE STATE MIGHT ENCOURAGE SUCH DESIGN STRATEGIES AS WELL AS PASSIVE SOLAR ARCHITECTURE IN GENERAL WHICH WOULD KEEP BUILDINGS COOL WITHOUT EXCESSIVE AIR CONDITIONING USE. THROUGH THESE THREE AREAS URBAN FORESTRY REFLECTIVE ROOF AND PAVING MATERIALS AND SHAPE PRODUCING BUILT FORM. BOTH LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT TAKE INITIATIVE TO REDUCE HEAT RISKS. AT RISK LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS COULD RECEIVE SPECIAL PRIORITY WITHIN SUCH PROGRAMS. THE END RESULT. WE'LL BE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES BOTH RURAL AND URBAN THAT STAY COOLER DURING THE NEXT CENTURY. BY HAVING MORE CONTINUOUS. TREE CANOPIES. COOLER ROOFS AND PAVED SURFACES. AND MORE GROUND LEVEL SHADE CREATED BY BUILDINGS AND SHADE STRUCTURES AND LET ME EMPHASIZE AGAIN THIS CAN HAPPEN FOR SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL PLACES AS WELL AS CITIES. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AT THANK YOU DOCTOR MILLER -- SO. WHEELER ACTUALLY WIENER. MY APOLOGIES -- IT'S CORRECT IN MY THE PAPER -- SAID I MEAN THE THE PROMISES THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HEAT WAVES WE'RE GONNA HAVE LONGER HEAT WAVES. AND COMMUNITIES -- THAT ARE ALREADY DISADVANTAGE ARE GONNA. BE THAT MUCH MORE IMPACTED ALONG THE WAY. HAVE YOU HAVE HAS YOUR RESEARCH LOOKED A LITTLE BAR CLOSELY SPECIFICALLY AT THAT CONNECTION WITH GHGS SHE WITH REDUCTIONS MEDICATION -- AND IF SO CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICS ON THAT. OKAY I HAVE LOOKED TO SEPARATELY AT MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR GREENHOUSE GASES. AND IN PARTICULAR I HAVE DONE SOME WORK WITH. DAN KAMIN AND CHRIS JONES WHO ARE AT UC BERKELEY. AROUND. CONSUMPTION BASED EMISSIONS OF THERE IS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE WONDERFUL WORK IN TERMS OF CLIMATE MITIGATION PLANNING. BUT THERE IS AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM ON THAT. ONE WHICH IS THAT WE DO NOT YET HAVE A GOOD WAY. OF INCLUDING EMISSIONS THAT RESULT FROM OUR CONSUMPTION STUFF WE BUY AND STUFF WE EAT. AND A LOT OF THOSE EMISSIONS ARE IN EFFECT EXPORTED TO CHINA OR OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD SO. ACTUAL CALIFORNIA MISSIONS ARE PROBABLY 30% HIGHER THAN WHAT WE NOW -- ARE TALKING ABOUT. IN THE LONG RUN I THINK PROBABLY THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WILL BE TO GET THOSE IN IN SOME WAYS THAT INCLUDES DIET VERY MUCH AS WELL AS HOUSEHOLD PURCHASES. AND IT ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE AIR TRAVEL WHICH ARE NOT WILL INCORPORATED CURRENTLY END -- IT WILL REQUIRE SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO MAKE THE PUBLIC AWARE OF THE IMPACT OF THESE THINGS. IT WILL REQUIRE BETTER. PROCESS SEES OF FIGURING OUT EMBODIED EMISSIONS IN PRODUCT. OF THINGS THAT WE BUY AND CONSUME. THAT IS COMING ALONG QUITE RAPIDLY -- END IT WILL REQUIRE -- LOT OF EDUCATION AND POLITICAL MESSAGING. WHICH I THINK WE ARE NOT YET REALLY. OF BEGINNING TO GET INTO. THANK YOU BEFORE -- I PROCEED I DO WANT TO LIE TO HAVE SENATOR WITH SO HERE WITH US. A TWO DAY AND BEFORE I ASK MY NEXT QUESTION DO YOU HAVE. ANY QUESTION YOURSELF FOR DOCTOR MILLER. AT OKAY THANK YOU -- IN THE LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT HERE BUT I ME MYSELF AND OUT. UP ABOUT THIS SHOOT. I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST UP. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OFTENTIMES. ENTRIES IN THE GROUND IS NOT THE CHALLENGE IS KEEPING THEM ALIVE. AND WHEN YOU GO TO RESIDENTS AND ASK THEM TO PARTNER. WITH YOU AND SAY WE'LL GIVE YOU A FREE TRIP TO CREATE A WATER IT MOST PEOPLE WHILE. MOST PEOPLE WON'T AGREE TO THAT IT'S VERY INTERESTING SOME WILL SOME WALTON THAT PRESENTS CHALLENGES AND THE OTHER ISSUE. IS AS HAVING TO DO WITH -- ARE DWINDLING FOREST ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH. WE'VE HAD WILD FIRES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE DECIMATED -- PINE FORESTS. IN THE AREAS OF KIND THE HIGHLANDS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SCIENTISTS HAVE -- OF HAVE PROGNOSTICATOR THAT. THESE TREES WILL NEVER RECOVER NATURALLY [inaudible] AND WHICH ONE WOULDN'T. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S HARD TO GET THESE TREES ADOPTED IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE LOW VEGETATION. AND IN OUR FORESTS WERE HAVING A HARD TIME REINTRODUCING -- A DENT IN NOT REGRET JUST REPLACING FORCE THAT WE'VE LOST AND AND YOU KNOW WHEN I'VE WHEN I'VE -- STUDIED HISTORY. IN FIFTEEN EN I'M SORRY AND YES OF FIFTEEN FORTY TWO WHAT WHEN CUANDO REDISCOVERY OF SAILED UP THE CALIFORNIA COAST. HE FOUND OF MONTEREY PINES. OFF THE COAST OF GATORADE -- NEGATIVE WHICH IS MADE PENINSULA BAJA CALIFORNIA. NOW THE ONLY MONTEREY PINES THAT EXIST ARE OUT SOME ISLANDS CALDWELL BALANCE AND THAT'S KIND OF A REMNANT OF A VERY LUSH FORESTS THAT USED TO BE COASTAL FORCED. AND WE'RE LOSING THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE [inaudible] HAVE YOU. CONSIDER THAT IN YOUR IN YOUR STUDIES HOW DO WE COMBAT. THE THE THE CONTINUE DOES THIS EFFORT. DESERT IF THE CATION. OF OUR STATE. I MEAN WHEN WE LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE S. IS VERY HARSH. ON PINE WOOD FORESTS. AND WHEN I LOOK AT OF THE NATIVE SPECIES OF CALIFORNIA THOUGH COASTAL LIVE OAK. EVEN THOSE ARE THREATEN ACROSS OUR STATE. WHAT DO WE WHAT DO WE INTRODUCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO REPLACE WHAT IS NATIVE? THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION. THERE ARE MULTIPLE ANSWERS TO THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MOUNTAIN FORCE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAPPENS IN URBAN. STREETS. WE MAY NEED TO GET AWAY FROM. NATIVE. I AM A BIGOT IS BIG A FAN AS ANYONE OF NATIVE LANDSCAPES BUT LET'S FACE IT IN THE FUTURE. THEY WILL BE DIFFERENT AND WE MAY NEED TO LOOK AT PLACES LIKE AUSTRALIA TO LOOK FOR DROUGHT TOLERANT SPECIES THAT WILL WORK HERE NOW. IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A LOT OF EUCALYPTUS WERE IMPORTED FROM AUSTRALIA AND WE DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THAT THAT DID NOT. ALWAYS WORK WELL BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER SPECIES THAT. COULD WORK AND WE NEED TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL ABOUT TRANSPORTING SPECIES ANYWHERE. BUT LET'S FACE IT OUR CLIMATE MAY BE CLOSER TO THE WEST COAST OF AUSTRALIA IN FIFTY YEARS DâN IT WILL BE TO WHAT CALIFORNIA USED TO BE -- LA HAD A MILLION TREE PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT ARM. HAD MIXED SUCCESS AND DID NOT ACHIEVE ANYTHING LIKE A MILLION TREES AS FAR AS I KNOW. OF THEY SOMETHING'S WORKED WELL BUT THEY CHOSE SOME SPECIES THAT DID REQUIRE. A FAIR BIT WATER. AND THOSE DIDN'T WORK. SO WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE JUDICIOUS ABOUT WHICH PIECES WE ACTUALLY CHOOSE. OF WE MAY NEED. TO LOOK AT ST DESIGNED DIFFERENTLY SO THAT THE RUNOFF FROM STREETS AND PARKING LOTS. IS HELD LOCALLY FOR THE TREES. AND PERHAPS EVEN GRAY WATER FROM BUILDINGS-- WE MAY WANT TO THINK HOLISTICALLY ABOUT WATER SYSTEMS SO THAT WE USE EVERY DROP THAT WE HAVE MORE EFFECTIVELY AND WE USE IT AND REUSE IT [inaudible] FOR VEGETATION [inaudible] OF BUT IN SOME CASES. WE MAY NOT HAVE THAT MUCH VEGETATION I USED TO WORK IN STATE OF NEW MEXICO WHICH IS MORE ARID IN MANY PLACES THAT CALIFORNIA -- THERE ARE NO LARGE NATIVE TREE SPECIES [inaudible] IN. ALBUQUERQUE WHERE I USED TO LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY WHICH IS. A UNIQUE CASE. SO IS A BIG QUESTION WHAT WE DO -- NOW THERE THERE DEFINITELY ARE SOME DESERT SPECIES THAT HAVE THAT TAKE VERY LITTLE WATER. THE USUALLY AREN'T AS DEEP AS SHAPE BUT THE DE ELEMENTARY. THEY ARE USEFUL AND THAT'S WHERE THE BILL FOR CONSENT TO WE NEED TO CREATE CHAIRED IN COMMUNITIES% AND IN A PLACES THE MEDITERRANEAN HAVE KNOWN THIS FOR MILLENNIA. BUT WE NEED TO RETHINK THE LOOK AND FEEL PERHAPS OF CALIFORNIA TOWNS. A BIT IN ORDER TO BE COMFORTABLE AND HEALTHY. THANK YOU -- MY LAST QUESTION WAS WE WERE LOOKING AT RURAL VERSUS URBAN COMMUNITIES AND HE HE THEIR LANDS. ARE THERE RECOMMENDATIONS OF I THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SIMILAR -- TO FIGHT THE IMPACTS FOR A ROLE AND ARE BETTER THE HAVE SET SEPARATE STRATEGIES THAT YOU RECOMMEND. WELL IN MANY ARE THE SAME -- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FARM WORK IN RURAL AREAS THAT WILL HAVE PARTICULAR NEEDS. TO PROTECT FARMWORKERS AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN URBAN PLACES -- BUT AS FAR AS THE TOWNS THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW THE IT'S THE SAME CHALLENGE. HOW DO YOU KEEP? PEOPLE'S DWELLINGS COMFORTABLE PEOPLE'S TRAVEL OUTDOORS COMFORTABLE -- SO IT'S NOT RADICALLY DIFFERENT. I WILL MENTION ONE OTHER THING ON MEDICATION I DO TEACH LAND USE PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND THE OTHER ONE OTHER BIG PIECE OF THE MEDICATION PICTURE THAT HASN'T WORKED RULES WELL SO FAR IS SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND ONE OF THE STUDIES HAS NOT WHERE IT HAS NOT WORKED -- BASICALLY LOCAL METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS HAVE OFTEN SIMPLY REBRANDED THEIR EXISTING REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN AS A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PLAN WITHOUT REALLY THINKING IT THROUGH. WHAT ALL THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF THAT WOULD BE? AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WE KNOW THEM DON'T HAVE. TO COMPLY WITH THE REGIONAL PLANS THAT ARE DONE IN TERMS OF LAND USE -- SO THE COMPLAINTS HAS BEEN PRETTY SPOTTY. SO I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING -- SECOND GENERATION ON THAT WHICH GOES QUITE A BIT FURTHER INFILL DEVELOPMENT. FOR PLACES THAT LEAD TO WERE YOU CAN LEAVE A LOW CARBON LIFESTYLE. DOES PRODUCE PRETTY GOOD RESULTS IN TERMS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS. IF YOU DO IT IN OUTLYING TOWNS THAT. WHERE IT'S NOT SO EASY TO LIVE WITHOUT A CAR OR WITHOUT RICK LONG DISTANCE COMMUTING? IT DOESN'T MATTER AS MUCH BUT WE DO WANT INFILL TO HAPPEN AND WE NEED SOME MORE INCENTIVES FOR IT TO HAPPEN AND WE NEED IT TO HAPPEN WITHOUT GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT IF POSSIBLE SO I KNOW THAT'S A BIG. ORDER BUT HAPPY TO TALK TO THAT IF YOU WANT. THANK YOU DOCTOR WITH VARYING GAVE US SOME HOMEWORK AT LOOKING AT SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IN A FUTURE ITERATION POSSIBLY OF THAT -- I DO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME -- AND SYNNEX WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TURN EXPRESS CENTER TODAY WE HAVE MARGARET GORDON WHO IS OUR WEST OAKLAND ENVIRONMENTAL -- INDICATORS CO FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR. THE NONPROFIT THAT WORKS WITH NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATIONS ASSISTANCE RESEARCHERS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO ENSURE WITH OAKLAND RESIDENTS HAVE A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT. THEY'VE NEVER HOODS AND ACCESS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND SO I DO APPRECIATE YOU MAKING TIME FOR US TO DAY AND EXCITED HERE -- YOUR PRESENTATION FROM KERN. OUR FIRST THOUGHT MY NAME IS MISS MARGARET I'M SEVENTY TWO YEARS OLD I'M NOT THINK I EARNED A B. COLUMN IS MARGARET. I'M ADDS SUBMITTED -- TO POWER POINTS DID YOU SEE WILL. I DIDN'T RECEIVE THAT BY THIS WITH YOU [inaudible] MARCH. I RECEIVED YOUR EMAIL BUT I WAS NOT ABLE TO OF LOCALS POWER POINT OKAY RIGHT. WELL ANYWAY FROM THE STAR FROM OUR ARMED. ARE BEGINNING AS THE ORGANIZATION ARE ORGANIZATIONS CALL WITH LOCAL ENVIRONMENT INDICATORS PROJECT WE'VE BEEN AT THIS WORK. FOR TWO DECADES AND I WORK IS BASED AROUND OF LOOK ABUSING BE SEARCHING DAY THE AS A PLATE AS A MARKER FOR ALL CAMPAIGNS PROJECTS PLANS. INITIATIVES -- DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS WE WE COME FROM A PLACE WHERE WE USE A RESEARCH AND DAVID. WE ALSO THE FIRST COMMUNITY THAT -- ON THE A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN IS DOING THE ACTION PLAN WITH THE ONLY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE IS DOING THE ACTUAL PLAN WE HAVE DONE OUR OWN AB ONE THING FOR THE CLASS. ALMOST TWENTY YEARS SO WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH AB MONITORED. AND SO WHEN YOU START TALK ABOUT THESE CONTAMINATIONS THAT'S THE NEW ONE ONE PART OF THE PROBLEMS THIS HAPPENED TO WES OKLA. CAM ERICA FOUNDATIONS AIR TALKS OF POLLUTION THIS ONE PARK WE HAVE A MULTIPLE PRAWN PROBLEM WITH WITH -- WITH. CLIMATE CHANGE AND CRIME AND JUSTICE IN WEST OAKLAND. SO IS NOT JUST ONE BANK IS A MULTIPLE THINGS AND WE CANNOT THIS CANNOT TALK ABOUT. AB AIR POLLUTION BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE LIVE. WE LIVE IN A A COMMUNITY OF WHERE THEIR SUPPORT AND THERE'S EXPANSIONS OF THAT PORT. THAT HAS IMPACTED WEST OAKLAND FOR VOTE OVER EIGHTY YEARS THAT WE AND I'M MORE RECENTLY -- WE FAMILY AFTER TWENTY YEARS GOT THE TO THE PLACE WHERE THERE ARE IN A PLAN OF DOING ZERO EIGHT MISSIONS. AFTER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. OUT SO IT'S NOT JUST ONE THING IS A MULTIPLE THINGS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH INFRASTRUCTURE. ISSUES -- WE HAVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY ISSUES WE HAVE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES -- OF OF A IMPACTS THEM THEN WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT ENFORCEMENT. LAND USE PROXIMITY AND EXPOSURE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS THAT DO NOT. SEEM TO MEET UP WITH OUR STATE REGULATIONS SO IS NOT THIS IS A MULTIPLE PRONG ISSUE FOR WONDER COMMUNITY. ABOUT TWENTY ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE BECAUSE WE HAVE A MULTIPLE LEVELS OF IMPACTS. SO IS THIS NOT THE POLLUTION ISSUE WAS NOT LIKELY AT AIR TOXIC CONTAMINATION IS ALSO THAT LIKE A STATE INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPOSURE IS LAND USE. AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVEN'T A MULTI PLANT MOST WILL PROMPT PLANT UP ENGAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SO THE COMMUNITY HAVE A BOWEL. EIGHT VALUE ROLE IN DEVELOPING THE OWN THEIR OWN STRATEGIES THAT BASICALLY THAT WE SEE AS A COMMUNITY THAT WILL BENEFIT US. AT NOT JUST COLD BEEN APPROVED BUT THE BENEFITS BUT NOT THE HELP HARM. SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE THE ISSUE OF JUST. LOOKING AT POLLUTION AND CONTAMINATION IS JUST ONE PART OF A PUZZLE THAT SUPPORT THAT THIS ONE COMMUNITY NEEDS. I HAVE AND HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR OVER. IN MY TIME I'VE BEEN AS AS AS A CITY WIDE IF. THEY HAVE WHAT YOU CALL THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. AND NOW HIS CHANGES TO FROM -- FROM THAT ENERGY ACTION PLAY OF THE WEAPON IN THE PLAN IN HIS ACTUAL PLAN THEY HAVE TO IT WOULD BE ACTUAL PLAN. SO WE DON'T HAVE WHAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THESE REAL ROLE BUS. COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING THAT WAS SUPPORT ALL THE COULDN'T THOSE COMMUNITIES. THAT GOES DOWN. EIGHT EIGHT A QUARTER THERE ARE IMPACTED FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT. THINGS THAT I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT. SO WHAT WE WOULD. WE DO NEED AS WE CAN YOU. THE USING THE POWER. UP SB. SIX ONE SEVEN TO REALLY TRULY PUT THE COMMUNITY. AT A PLACE WHERE WE ARE AND THE ASSISTANT IN LEARNING ABOUT THE SCIENCE THE MONITORING AND PLAN AND HOW DO WE RATE TRANSPORTATION PLANS. TRANSPORTATION. PLANS AND OUT OF WORK WHO ARE ERE DISTRICT TO BE -- WORKING IN COLLABORATION AND USING COMMUNITY A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT UP. PROCESSES TO BE MORE INCLUDING. OF US AS A VALUE AND NOT JUST AS THE AS A DETRIMENT BUT AS A BAG -- TO BE ABLE TO TO TO UP OBLIGATIONS WILL HELP THE COMMUNITY THEN WE ALSO OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTANDING -- WORKING WITH THOSE PART OF THOSE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WILL TRULY WANTS TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP. AND WOOD TECHNICAL PUT CAPACITY AND THE NEEDS FOR WORKING WITH A WOULD COMMUNITY AND TRAINING. ONE OF THINGS WE FOUND OUT EVERY AGENCY STAFF PERSON SHOULD NOT BE IN A ROOM WITH COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS THAT. THEY DON'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE DON'T KNOW THE COMMUNITY THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING OUT OF OUT OF IN A VACUUM SOMEWHERE IN TWO EIGHT TWO WILL GO ARE INTO A DEBTS ARE OUT OF A BOOK. THAT HAVE THEY'VE NEVER HAD A REAL ENGAGEMENT WITH WITH THOSE WHO ARE BIMBOS WOMBLE THEY DON'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE THEY DON'T KNOW THE PEOPLE AND SOMEONE WOULD JUST PLAYING OUT JUST A YEAR. ALL RIGHT SO AND THEN THE LAST THING WE NEED LONG TERM FINANCING TO SUPPORT. IT. OUR NEW AIRPLANES OVER TIME. SO WITH THE THE BOTH WILL PROMPT PLANNING NOT JUST TO DEAL WITH THIS CONTAMINATION WE NEED A MUCH MORE. THE PUZZLES ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER BUT THIS PUZZLE BECAUSE THIS LONG TERM THING I'M NOT NOT BE ABLE TO WIN BUT TWENTY FIFTY ALL RIGHT AB. SEVENTY TWO ABOUT LET ABOUT DID HE THE S. NEXT THIRTY ONE YEARS AS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD I HAD THE GOOD. SO ANYWAY BUT DOESN'T SAY THAT WE NEED JUST MORE MUCH MORE THAN JUST TALK ABOUT CONTAMINATION WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE BIG PICTURE WE GOT BIG PICTURE. ISSUE WE GOT HAVE A BIG PICTURE IDEAS BIG PICTURE PLANNING BIG. IT'S A FINANCING TO DEAL WITH LL THESE ISSUES AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS MARGRET -- YOU TALK ABOUT NEEDING ROBUST COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING AND HOW IT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IDEAS YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO ADOPT TO HELP? THAT HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT -- SETTLEMENT SAYING I WILL SAY THIS AT THE BAR I WAS A SEVENTEEN YEAR IT UP AND GET UP -- RELATIONSHIP WITH. THE AIR DISTRICT FROM THE BAY AREA. SO I HAVE SO. WE HAVE SHAPED A LOT OF THAT STAFF. WHEN THEY WANT TO COME TO THE TO WEST OAKLAND THEY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND HAVE A? AND WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS OF THE SO THAT'S HOW WE WERE ABLE TO DO OUR PARTNERSHIP. BOB HOPE PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM IN. AND DEVELOPING THIS SB SIX UP SB SIX ACTUALLY PLAYED. EVERYBODY A IN HAD THE BILL HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OF THEIR DISTRICTS THAT'S NUMBER. ONE AND ALSO WE HAVE HAD WE HAVE HEAD RELATIONSHIPS THE BUILDING ALL OF THE PROJECTS THAT DEALING WITH THE CITY A WITH THE WITH THE PORT OF OAKLAND. ARE THE CITY OAKLAND PORTAL OPENED SO WE HAVE HAD WE HAVE HAD DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENGAGEMENT SO WE AT SOME FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER'S. EACH OTHER BUT BUT SOME STEP. I BIGGEST MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IN SCIENCE THAT IS DEALING WITH IT. STAFF IS THAT THE CITY OF OAKLAND AND START MAYOR STAFF AVAILABLE CAR. THEY HAVE THEY BEEN IN THE Q. WILL GO AND ALL THOSE THAT HAVE NO TRAINING UNDERSTAND TO BE ENGAGING. WITH COMMUNITY. THEY HAD NO TRAINING THEY HAVE NO SKILL SET NO PROBLEM. ALL RIGHT THEY DID STE I DON'T KNOW WITH SOMEONE COME FROM I DON'T KNOW THE EXPANSIVE I HAVE NO REAL BOTTLES ONLY UP I JUST DON'T WE JUST DON'T KNOW AND THEY COME WITH. WITH. BANGS THAT DEATH I'M NOT A PROBLEM FARM WITH JUSTICE I DON'T KNOW IS FROM A BUSINESS PLAN I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT COME FROM IS A TOLD THE BUREAUCRACY. A WHAT SOME FOLKS NEED TO BE TRYING TO REPORT TO COME OUT AND TO COMMUNITY I'M JUST SORRY BIG JUST. NEED THAT SKILL SET. AND THEN I'M ALSO GOING TO SAY THAT WHEN IT COMES OUT TO STRUCTURAL PROJECTS UP AS INFRASTRUCTURE. NEEDS FOR OUR COMMUNITY OUR OUR WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT WE KNOW THAT HAS BEEN THE PROBLEM NOT SUB? ENGINEER COMING INTELLIGENCE WHAT THEY KNOW WAS THE PROBLEM NO THEY NEED TO LISTEN TO WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW OFTEN. THIS CORNER RIGHT HERE FROM THE FROM OF FROM RAIN ARE FROM THE ARE ARE HOW OFTEN WE HAVE WHEN WE HAVE A A A HI IT'S WHERE THEIR DAYS THAT WE HAVE TO CLOSE OUT WINDOWS AND NOT A NO -- HAVE SPARE THEIR DAYS BUT WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE TO RUN A PAIN TO BE ABLE TO COOL OFF THE COMMUNE OUR OUR HOUSES. ARE WHICH COMMUNITIES THOSE NEED TO BE. RE ASSESSED TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH AS A COOL CONSUMER WE NEED PEOPLE JUST TO LISTEN TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE COME FROM. AND THEN LET'S MOVE THIS. BILL WHERE HOW WE WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER WHAT WE THOUGHT WE SEE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN -- WE CAN COLLABORATE ABOUT AND THEN I'D ALSO BE A WHIP. PUT TO THE PARKING LOT WHERE WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO DEBATE. I WE HAVE COMPLEX ABOUT AND BLANK IF NECESSARY FRONT IN A FACILITATOR OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION PERSON TO SUPPORT OF TO GET BEYOND THAT. SO THIS IS THE KIND OF THING IS ACTUALLY IS. NEEDED FOR US TO HAVE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE ROBUST. PLANNING FOR OUR COMMUNITY OF HIS MOBILE THIS BIG PICTURE. MISS MARGARET -- A I AGREE WITH YOU. I HEAR THIS BACK HOME I HAVE A A MORE SPECIFIC QUESTION -- RECENTLY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO DO I DECIDED TO DELVE INTO. THESE PUBLIC DATA SET THAT WE HAVE ONLINE I WHETHER IT'S TO DO OUR CALAVERAS WIENER OR THROUGH. DIFFERENT DATA SETS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR WATER BOARDS AND OUR LOCAL ARE DISTRICTS -- AND SOMEWHERE A LITTLE FRIENDLIER THAN OTHERS -- FOR FROM MYSELF ALONG THE WAY. WHEN? YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR FOR A LONG TIME AND BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE WORKING ON COMMUNITY ACTION PLANS. HOW USEFUL HAS THE STATE OF AN OUT THERE ON GHG INVENTORIES ARE OR ANYTHING ELSE IN IN THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IT IS THIS THIS THIS HELP IS NOT? IS NOT A POPULAR EDUCATION FORMAT. IT DOES NOT GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT PEOPLE WHERE PEOPLE ARE. SOMEBODY WENT INTO A ROOM SOMEWHERE AND THE THAT. THAT WAS NO EXCHANGE OF IDEAS OUR EXPERIENCES WIND THAT WAS DEVELOPED. WE ALSO WENT DEVELOPING TO SAY WHAT HERE THIS IS IT. AND AND AND AND AND DIDN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE HISTORICAL -- OF THEY HISTORICAL -- EXPERIENCES WHAT A WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SOME COMMUNITIES IN SOME OF THESE. SOME OF THESE WEBSITES. SO IT. EVERY EVERY THERE'S NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AND IT'S CLEARLY THAT. THE SCIENCES BY THE TIME OF THE TAKE THE PERSON DID NOT CLEARLY DID NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE NEW THERE'S A NEW WAY OF SEEING. HOW COMMUNITIES SEES ITSELF BASED ON HIS OWN? NEEDS. AND DESIRES AND HEALTH IT'S NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL. SO THAT'S IT THANKS. SOME OF THOSE. MYSELF PERSONALLY AS A CO DIRECTOR OF ORGANIZATION ALWAYS HAVE. LEARN TO FIND OUT. BY MY OWN TECHNICAL PERSON THANK YOU BREAK IT DOWN. TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE OUR OWN TECHNICAL PEOPLE TO BE OUR TECHNICAL PEOPLE THE SCIENTISTS THE ENGINEER WHOEVER THE IS WE NEED TO HAVE BE ABLE. TO SELECT OUR OWN PEOPLE OP I'M I'M NOT DEPEND ON OWN. OF THE OF THE AGENCIES. DOCUMENTATION WHAT OUT HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE [inaudible] DO A TRYING TO REFINE IT TO THE PLACE WHERE I CAN I CAN GO BACK AND TALK TO MY NEIGHBORS ABOUT. I COULD GO BACK TALK TO MY GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT. AND I FEEL THAT SOME OF THE STUFF DOES DOES NOT RELATE. DOES NOT HELP TO EMPOWER THE COMMUNITY BY HAVING THE ABILITY BE ORIENTATED THE EDUCATE. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE PLANS BE ENGAGING IN THE PLANNING PROCESS. SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SPOKE ABOUT IS HEALTH METRICS THE DATA OUT THERE DOESN'T GIVE US THAT CONNECTION NO. NO ARE THERE OTHER CONNECTIONS BEYOND HELP THAT YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT AS WERE LOOKING AT THIS DATA TO MAKE IT MORE USEFUL RELATABLE. I THINK ALSO THE DISTANT LOOK THESE COMMUNITY. MANY OF THESE COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT'S. DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MESSAGE TO COMMUNITY -- SPECIALLY THOSE IMPACTED INVIOLABLE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK THE QUESTION. THEY DO MAKE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS. AND I THINK THAT. HAVE A LOT OF SUBSTANCE. AT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT COMMUNITY AT BUT IS THIS DOES DOES I'M NOT RACES. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE YOU USUALLY BE RELAXED ENOUGH BINGO AND A JOB. AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHERE IS THAT THE COMMUNITY SHOULD BE AT THE CENTER PLACE OF SHAPING. MESSAGING [inaudible] MR RUSSELL. I'M SURE JUST WANTED A THANK. MISS GORDON FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I'VE I'VE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE FOR QUITE AWHILE NOW I MY NINETY YEAR AND I SERVED AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A COUNCIL MEMBER FOR FIVE YEARS AND PRIOR TO THAT. I ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AS A PROJECT MANAGER ONE OF THE UC DEPARTMENTS THAT HANDLED COMMUTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND I'VE HAD A THE CHANCE TO WORK -- FACING WITH COMMUNITIES OF DIFFERENT LEVELS BEGINNING. AS AN ADVOCATE FOR MY OWN COMMUNITY. AND IT'S A IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING FOR YOU TO FIGHT FOR YOUR COMMUNITY AND AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I WANT GOVERNMENT TO DO WELL FOR US AND IT'S A DIFFERENT PLACE TO BE WHERE WE ARE SO. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME LET ME TELL YOU YOUR YOUR MESSAGE HERE TODAY'S VERY REFRESHING THAT SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT AND SOMETHING I NEVER HEARD. FROM SOMEBODY IN THE COMMUNITY SAY THAT. WE NEED TO NEED TO FIND BETTER WAYS STE. WAYS TO HAVE. THE GOVERNMENT WORK FOR OUR COMMUNITY IN THAT AT ALL IN A AND A CAPACITY WERE WERE ACTUALLY. NOT ONLY LISTENING BUT PUT IN. OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE DRIVER SEAT. WHEN YOU SAY THAT WE WE NEED ENGINEERS AND WE NEED SEAT NEED SCIENTISTS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THEM? AND THEY THEY WORK FOR YOU. AND THEY SHOULD BE WORKING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS ON YOUR BEHALF AND MAKING SURE THAT YOUR YOUR HEARD AND ONE OF THINGS SAID THAT. THAT FRUSTRATED ME MORE AS A COMMUNITY ADVOCATE IS ACTUALLY MAKE YOU PUTTING IN PHONE CALLS TO LEADERS AND CHOOSE A COMMUNITY -- TO CITY STAFFORD COUNTY STAFF AND NEVER GET TO GET MY CALL RETURN. IT'S A HORRIBLE FEELING TO PUT IN A CALL AND HAVE IT BE IGNORED. MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE. YOU'RE NOBODY MAKES YOU FEEL THIS BIG. WHEN I PROMISE NEVER TO DO THAT? BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'VE BEEN ON THE ON THE ON THIS SIDE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO MY COMMUNITY GET PEOPLE ENGAGE AND TRY TO GET THEM TRYING TO GET THEM. TO LEAD ON CERTAIN ISSUES HAVING MIXED RESULTS IN SOME CASES WE HAD ENORMOUS SUCCESS AND OTHERS -- PEOPLE ARE LESS SEEMED SEEM TO BE LESS INTERESTED OR NOT GONNA BLAME IT ON THEM. BECAUSE FINDING THE RIGHT STRATEGIES OUT REACH IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE. IT'S ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT HAVING PEOPLE THAT ARE PRO ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND KNOCKING ON DOORS IS IS NOT ALWAYS. COMMON PLACE IN EVERY COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WHERE PEOPLE TEND TO FEEL MORE FRUSTRATED AND FEEL LIKE THEIR GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM? NOT KNOWING THAT THEY CAN HARNESS THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. SO. YOU KNOW I I RECEIVE YOUR MESSAGE AS A CHALLENGE HERE FOR US. TO TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND SAY HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB CONNECTING. WITH OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY CAN TEACH US SO MUCH. ABOUT HOW TO BETTER PLAN WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A CONFLICT TO ARISE. TO RESPOND TO A NEED. AND IN MY EXPERIENCE IF THE WE HAD AN AIR QUALITY PROBLEM BLOT BROUGHT ON BY A CHROMIUM PLATING BUSINESS. THE JUST SIMPLY WAS [inaudible] OPERATING [inaudible] WANTONLY OR IT A IN IN IN IN. NOT IN RESPECT OF OF OUR LAWS AND OUR C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AIR QUALITY LAWS&lt;/c&gt;</u> WHAT WE DID IS WE HAD TO RISE UP. AND AND AND CREATE A CONFLICT TO GET PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT TO LISTEN TO US IN A XIN HAVE HAVE TO COME TO THAT. SHOULD NOT HAVE TO COME FOR TO US SAYING. COME LISTEN TO US. THE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT ALL GOVERNMENT HAS TO INVEST IN NOT REACHING HAS TO INVEST IN CONNECTING WITH THE PUBLIC AND HAS. TO START WORKING ON ADDRESSING THOSE SCHOOLS PROACTIVELY BEFORE. SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS BEFORE. OF PEOPLE NOW HAVE COMMUNITY HAVE TO ORGANIZE RUN ISSUE BECAUSE THEY'RE FRUSTRATED NO. AND AND JUST FEEL COMPLETELY IGNORED SO. I'M TELLING YOU I'VE NEVER. AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE I'VE AND HURT SOMEBODY LIKE YOU COME FORWARD AND AND MAKE THESE COMMENTS IN THE MANNER THAT YOU HAVE AN AND I APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE AND AND THAT YOU ARE -- HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WITH THIS MESSAGE JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. AND I LIKE THE ONES ARE ALSO A AS OUR ORGANIZATION WE DEVELOP. A PLAN TO GET OUR OWN TECHNICAL RESOURCES SO WE HAVE OUR OWN EHRMANN BRING WOMEN. TRYING TO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS HOW TO USETHAT EQUIPMENT WE TAKE THAT WE HAVE TAKEN A QUICK APPOINTMENT UP AND DOWN THE STATE CROSS AND THEY SHOULD. SHOW OF THE COMMUNITIES HOW. THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR OWN ISSUES GET THE EVIDENCE. AND I'M LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE HAVE OUR OWN RESEARCH TEAM AND PARTNERSHIP WITH. BOSE. THOSE OF THOSE MOST TECHNICAL WE DO I DO NOT GO INTO A ANYTHING WHAT HAPPENED A REAL STRATEGY UNDERSTANDING ROLES AND TASKS FUNDING TOOLS ALL THOSE THINGS AND PART OF THE ISSUES THAT MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND LOT OF I MEAN THE ORGANIZATIONS. MAKING REMAINS AND THAT COME WITH THE EVIDENCE WE NEED TO COME OUT OWN EVIDENCE TO PROVE OUR ISSUE. NOT MAKING DEMANDS AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SHOW THAT THIS IS THE ISSUE. SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE HOW HOW DO YOU WORK IN COLDEST WHAT WORKING COALITION WORK IN COLLABORATION. AND HAVING THOSE TECHNICAL THINGS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. ALL OUR COMMUNITIES DO NOT HAVE THAT CAPACITY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY ISSUE. BACK KEY COMMUNITIES FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE AS ROBUSTLY AND HAPPEN COMPREHENSIVE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT CAPACITY. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. THESE LAST YEAR'S OF MIND THAT I AM PUTTING FORTH HOW DO I GIVE BACK TO THOSE COMMUNITIES TO LEARN HOW TO USE THESE. THESE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THAT I LEARNED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. SO ARE NOT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE A A MISS MARGARET WE'RE NOT ALL AS THIS LUCKY DO YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS OF HOW WE HEAR CAN HELP [inaudible] HELP. DEVELOP THAT EXPERTISE HELPED CREATE MORE MISS MARKETS OTHER HELP YOU AT YOUR WORK AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SHARING YOUR SCHOOL SITTING IN FOR EXPERTISE WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES. HOW DO WE HELP THAT SO THAT WE CAN GET FASTER AND DEEPER AS THIS NICKEL SAID EARLIER AND I ADVOCACY WORK OKAY BUT? A LITTLE ONE THE THINGS IS THAT THAT THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THAT. AYE AYE AS ONE INDIVIDUAL NEED TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE IS THAT I CAN MEET. COMMUNITY WHERE THEY'RE AT AND WORK WITH THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL. KEEP GOING TO THE NEXT LEVEL. IF I DON'T HAVE A BOTTLE HAVE THE THE RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT MY MYSELF AND MY FAMILY TO BE BUT THIS WILL HELP SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE. I'M COSTS THE EITHER ON EMAIL I'M DOING IT BY EMAIL AS SOON AS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OUR PAINT THINGS ON MY OWN POCKET TO GET TO SOME PLACE. SO I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOMEPLACE WHERE THIS ANNUAL. ANNUAL SETTINGS WHERE I COULD COME ARE. BY BUT LEAVE SAVINGS WHAT I COULD COME AND WORK WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO REQUESTS. MIKE TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT. I I'M I'M NOT A PERSON TO PUT JUST. PUT MYSELF ON YOU BUT IF I CAN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW OUT OUT OUT OF A BRAIN DUMP ALL DAY LONG. WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE DONE AND HAVE AND HAVE DONE TO BUILDINGS RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE IT'S STILL COMES DOWN TO BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS. GOOD BAD INDIFFERENT YOU KNOW WHEN EVERYTHING WHICH IS STILL GOT TO KEEP THIS WOULD GET TO KEEP THAT. THAT PATHWAY OF RELATIONSHIPS OPEN [inaudible] WITH [inaudible] THE POLLUTERS [inaudible] WITH REGULATORS. WITH THAT TAKE THE PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE. YOU STILL GOT TO KEEP THE WITH EVEN TODAY YOU HAVE BELIEVE WE GOT TO GO BUT TOMORROW I'LL CALL YOU LATER. BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS OPEN. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IS NOT ABOUT THEM WITH THOSE GUYS WITH AIR QUALITY DOES NOT HAVE. DOES NOT SEEM THE EVERYBODY'S LOANS THE SAME WAY I WILL GET YOU. WELL WITH THAT THANK YOU MISS MARKET I DO APPRECIATE. YOUR TIME AND YOUR WITH THEM -- YOU GAVE ME SOME HOMEWORK OF HOW DO I MAKE SURE I HOPE YOU GET OUT THERE ALL RIGHT I I HEARD YOU AND I DO WANT YOU OUT THERE SO. MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE AIRPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN FUNDING WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THAT MORE FEASIBLE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU MISS MARGARET. AND FINALLY I HAVE. COMING UP HERE. MICHAEL CLARA BORN WHO IS. WITH THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HE'S GOING TO BE TALKING TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE URBAN IN THIS A SIDE OF THINGS ASK I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAD UR PRESENTATION ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT I REMEMBER THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MY BACKYARD BUT ABOUT THE FORTY MILLION ANGELINO SOUTH INCLUDING OUR FOLKS AND THE AG INDUSTRY. AND SO MICHAEL THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME FOR US TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME'S ABOUT CLAIBORNE I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- WHERE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT BASED AND FRESNO WITH OFFICES IN BAKERSFIELD AND THESE COACHELLA VALLEY? AND THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE EFFORTS AND ROLLER LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES REQUIRE LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL PLANNING. AND SMART INVESTMENTS THAT MAKES SENSE UNDER THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES FACING EACH COMMUNITY. CLIMATE CHANGE PLANNING AND INVESTMENTS IN ADDITION TO BEING NECESSARY TO FACE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS HISTORIC INEQUITIES AND LACK OF INVESTMENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THE S. COACHELLA VALLEY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE REQUIRES IMPROVED COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES. AND ALIGNMENT OF STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS TO MEANINGFULLY RESPOND. TO CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FACING FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES. THESE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET OUR SB THIRTY TWO GOALS. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IS HOME. TO MANY INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES IN THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S INDUSTRIALIZED FACTORY FARMS INCLUDING DERRY'S AS WELL AS 30% OF THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ACCORDING CALAMARI SCREEN SOLUTIONS MUST MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS AGRICULTURAL AND AT AN INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS AND RURAL AREAS LIKE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TO COMMUNITIES THAT I WORK WITH -- ALONG SIDE AND REPRESENT AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY -- THE FIRST COMMUNITY IT'S CALLED TO REBEL IT'S AN TO LARRY COUNTY IT'S A COMMUNITY OF SEVENTY SIX HOMES. JUST. ABOUT A MILE EAST OF EXETER AND IT SITS AT THE BASE OF THE FOOTHILLS -- IN THE CENTRAL SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS AND IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT AT ACTUALLY AT THE END OF THE STREETS TO THE FRANK CURRENT CAN NOW. IT'S A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY WITHIN AN ESTIMATED MHI OF ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND THE COMMUNITY HAS STRUGGLED WITH DRINKING WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY ISSUES FOR DECADES -- INCLUDING CONTAMINATION FROM NITRATE HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM -- AND MOST RECENTLY SALINITY WHICH HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS WITH A FEW THINGS I'LL GET -- TO GIVEN PROXIMITY TO THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS WHICH OBVIOUSLY GIVE VERY DRY IN THE SUMMER -- THERE IS EXTREME VIRUS SCAN IN THE COMMUNITY OF TO REBEL AND VERY LOW FIRE FLOW SO WHEN YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT FIRE PROTECTION. THE FIRE FLOW JUST ISN'T THERE FOR THAT. I INTENTIONALLY HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE CM A SUMMER AND TO THE BILL SOMETIMES EXCEED OFTEN EXCEED. A HUNDRED AND TEN DEGREES -- ANA WITH AN AVERAGE OF BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR OF THESE HIGH HEAT DAYS PER YEAR BUT CALIDAD. PREDICTS THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE LIKE FORTY SIX TO EIGHTY HIGH HEAT THE DAYS AND TO A BILL. BY TWENTY SEVENTY SO THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO GET A WHOLE LOT WORSE. MOST RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONING INTO REBEL AND INSTEAD RELY ON SWAMP COOLERS -- ANYBODY THAT USED A SWAMP COOLER KNOWS THAT THAT START GETTING LESS AND LESS EFFECTIVE AS THAT TEMPERATURE RISES. AND EDITION OF THAT PROBLEM -- INTO REBEL THE SALINITY IN THE WATER IS CLOGGING UP THOSE SMALL COOLER SO THEY DON'T EVEN FUNCTION AS WELL AS THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE -- ADDITIONALLY. TWO WE WILL AS EXCEEDED STATE AND WHAT THE SALINITY ISSUE -- AND THEN THE LOW PRESSURE ISSUE ALSO IMPACTS THE SWAMP COOLERS IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT NOT FUNCTION VERY WELL. THE COMMUNITY ALSO HAS TO DEAL WITH HIGH AGRICULTURAL EMISSIONS FROM NEARBY ORANGE ORCHARDS AND THOSE INCLUDE AND AS WE KNOW PM TWO POINT FIVE PM TEN PESTICIDES AND NOT TRUE NATURES OXIDE. PESTICIDE PROBLEMS OF GOT MORE SEVERE AS HIGH HEAT DAYS AND WARM NIGHTS HAVE BECOME MORE COMMON. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND I COMMUNITY AND IN MANY COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO LEAVE WINDOWS OPEN AT NIGHT BECAUSE OF POOR AIR QUALITY. IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS. TO KEEP THEIR SWAMP COOLERS AND IF THEY'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. RUNNING AT NIGHT FOR THE SAME REASONS -- TO REVEAL IS APPROXIMATELY LIKE I SAID A MILE FROM THE CITY OF EXETER AND THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO REBEL ANNEX THERE THAT THE COOLING CENTERS IN EXETER. ARE -- IMPRACTICAL TO ACCESS FOR FOLKS WITHOUT CARS AND THAT'S MANY IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE'S ALSO TRANSPORTATION ASPECT TO THIS. MOST OF THESE ISSUES ARE NOT READILY APPARENT JUST FROM LOOKING AT STATE DATA SOURCES LIKE CALLUM IRIS SCREEN. FOR EXAMPLE CALAVERAS DURING -- SHOWS TO LEGALIZE WITHIN A CENSUS TRACT THAT STOP FORTIETH PERCENTILE -- IT'S LUMPED IN WITH A BIG PORTION OF THIS YEAR AS AND IT DOESN'T CAPTURE A COMMUNITY AS SMALL AS TO EGO -- SO STATE LEVEL POLLS LIKE CALABAR FIRE SCREEN WHILE PROVIDING VERY CRITICAL INFORMATION OR LOOKING AT THESE PROBLEMS ON A SENSE OF SCALE OFTEN OVERLOOKED COMMUNITIES LIKE TO THE BILL. DUE TO THEIR SMALL SIZE COMPARED AT SUCH A SIZE OF THE CENSUS TRACT -- TO LEGAL THAT'S HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LOCAL PLANNING AND MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO ENSURE THAT CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY EFFORTS. ARE TAILORED TO SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES ON THE GROUND IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO EVEN IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE LITTLE ON SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS AT AND LESS WE ACTUALLY GO TO COMMUNITIES. MEETING FULLY ENGAGE RESIDENTS AND IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE GROUND. A SIMILAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS PROVIDED BY THE COMMUNITIES OF CAN'T TO A CREE CANNOT PORTMAN HERE. IN WESTERN FRESNO COUNTY BOTH COMMUNITY IS OUR IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT AND ABOUT AN HOUR -- TO THE WEST OF THE CITY OF FRESNO. BOTH ARE A LITTLE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND BOTH HAVE STRUGGLED WITH POOR WATER QUALITY. AIR QUALITY AND LACK OF EFFECTIVE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS RESIDENTS OF CAN'T TO A CREEK AND EL PORVENIR STRUGGLE WHICH RANKING WATER THAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CONTAMINATED BUT WITH NITRATE. AND MORE RECENTLY WITH SOMETHING CALLED DISINFECTANT BY PRODUCTS WHICH IS A RESULT OF RECEIVING WATER FROM WESTLANDS WATER DISTRICT THAT TO BE TREATED -- AND PROVIDED AND PRODUCED DISINFECTANT BRIGHT BY PRODUCTS SUCH THAT THE WATER CAN'T BE -- CONSUMED OR SHOULDN'T BE CONSUMED. AND BASED ON THIS ARRANGEMENT WITH WESTLANDS FOLKS ARE ALSO -- EXPERIENCING VERY VERY HIGH WATER BILLS -- SOMETIMES OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR WATER THAT RESIDENTS CAN'T DRINK. LIKE TO LEGAL RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE HIGH HE DAIS AND MANY RESIDENTS LACK AIR CONDITIONING AND COULDN'T AFFORD TO RUN A CONDITIONING IF THAT HAD IT. THESE ISSUES ARE EXACERBATED BY ISSUES WITH THEIR WATER SYSTEM -- LIKE INTO A BILL. GIVEN THE LONG ONE HOUR DRIVE TO FRESNO FOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES LIKE MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES AND LEGAL SERVICES. ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT MANY RESIDENTS LACKED VEHICLES AND CAN AFFORD CANNOT AFFORD GAS FOR FREQUENT TRIPS TO FRESNO. RESIDENTS IDENTIFIED IMPROVEMENTS TO TRANSPORTATION AS HIGH PRIORITY. FOR THE BOTH COMMUNITIES TO RESPOND TO THE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS COMMUNITY RESIDENTS PARTNERED WITH. MY ORGANIZATION AND A RIDE CHER COMPANY CALLED GREEN COMMUTER AND ORGAN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO START THE COUNTRY'S FIRST ALL ELECTRIC RURAL RIDE CHER. THEY NOW HAVE TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE DRIVEN BY RESIDENTS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS ABOUT COMMUNITIES HAVE A TRANSPORTATION. OPTION THAT WORKS FOR THEM THEY HAVE A WAY TO GET TO FRESNO TO AXIS. AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND ALSO IT'S A IT'S A PROGRAM THAT'S OPERATED BY RESIDENTS WITH -- ZERO EMISSIONS SO WE SEE THAT AS A MODEL AND SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND -- WE'RE WORKING WITH GREEN COMMUTER AGAIN AND DEL HIGH AND ALSO LOOKING AT KERN COUNTY AS ANOTHER OPTION TO EXPAND THAT PROGRAM. BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE STATE SHOULD LOOK HARD AT TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THAT WORK FOR COMMUNITIES AND ARE TAILORED TO RURAL COMMUNITIES. FINALLY I'M GONNA TURN A LITTLE BIT TO AGRICULTURAL EMISSIONS -- ONE NEARLY UNIVERSAL FACT ABOUT LIVING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THE EAST COAST COACHELLA VALLEY IS PROXIMITY TO AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS THESE INCLUDE LARGE DAIRIES ALMOND ORCHARDS GRAPEVINES FOOD PROCESSING PLANTS. AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES -- WITH RESPECT TO DERRY'S THERE'S WELL BUT THERE IS AN IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TIE BETWEEN WATER QUALITY AND AIR QUALITY. I WORK A LOT MORE ON THE WATER QUALITY SIDE -- BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY -- INTERSECTION THERE -- FOR DERRY'S MANURE MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT AT TERRY'S AND INTERROGATE EMISSIONS FROM -- CALLOUS CONTRIBUTE FIVE POINT 4% OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FOURTEEN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND FAR MORE WHEN CALCULATED. ON A TWENTY YEAR GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL. METHANE EMISSIONS FROM ENTERIC FERMENTATION ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT METHANE INVENTORY WELL MINORE MANAGEMENT CONTRIBUTES ANOTHER APPROXIMATELY 26%. THIS IS A A BIG CHUNK OF THE METHANE WITHIN THE STATE. IN HOPE OF REDUCING EMISSIONS THE STATE HAS INVESTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER AND RATE PAYER SUBSIDIES. TOWARDS CONSTRUCTION OF DERRY DIGESTERS A LOT OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE THINK THERE'S NO EVIDENCE SO FAR THAT THE STATE JESTERS ARE A GOOD INVESTMENT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE. NO AIR QUALITY MONITORING TO ESTABLISH EMISSION REDUCTIONS IF ANY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR DIGEST ERRORS AND ADDITIONALLY THOUGH DERRY DIGEST OUR PROGRAM INCENTIVIZE IS AN INSURERS CONTINUE DAIRY HERDS OF A SIZE THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH GHG REDUCTIONS. AS WELL AS WATER QUALITY PROTECTION. THE STATE SHOULD BEGIN THE REGULATOR IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS AND SHOULD TAKE A MUCH HARD TO LOOK AT MORE BENEFICIAL PROGRAMS SELECT DRIVING OR MANAGEMENT. TURNING TO IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND AND NITROUS OXIDE. NITROUS OXIDE AS A PRIMARY COMPONENT -- WITH AIR POLLUTION AS WE KNOW A RECENT STUDY CONCLUDES THAT 252401% OF THE STATE'S NITROUS OXIDE. IS RELATED TO IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE. DECIDE NOT TO MISSIONS ARE DIRECTLY TIES TO OVER APPLICATION OF NITROGEN FERTILIZER BY IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE. AND AGAIN THIS IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN BOTH AIR QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY SO OVER APPLICATION OF FERTILIZER WHILE BOTH -- DEGRADING OUR AIR QUALITY IS HAVING A REALLY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON WATER QUALITY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL COAST'S SOME SOMETIMES UPWARDS OF 40% OF DOMESTIC WELLS. ARE NOW CONTAMINATED WITH NITRATE -- AND THIS IS AGAIN DIRECTLY TIED OVER APPLICATION OF FERTILIZER. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE STATE BEGIN TO LOOK AT STRICT LIMITS ON FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS -- AND THAT THE STATE MUST ALSO PUT IN PLACE STRONG RESTRICTIONS ON PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS FOR PROTECTION. OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND THEN FINALLY TO CONCLUDE I'LL JUST SHARE A COUPLE OF FINAL THOUGHTS REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE PLANNING AND INVESTMENTS AND WRITE A REGULATIONS IMPACTING. RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN AND THESE COACHELLA VALLEY -- FOR ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE EFFORTS AND WROTE COME IN A COMMUNITIES TO BE EFFECTIVE WE NEED A FEW THINGS. FIRST WE NEED A LOCAL PLANNING THAT INCLUDES MEANINGFUL OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY RESIDENT RESIDENTS. ON A COMMUNITY LEVEL AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE SOLUTIONS IDENTIFIED BY AND TAILORED TO EACH COMMUNITY -- AND FINALLY WE NEED TARGETED INVESTMENTS FOCUSED ON RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PARTICULAR DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS NEED. AS A CONTINUED SHAME THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE NOT YET ELIGIBLE FOR TCC -- CLIMATE OR TRANSFORMATIVE COMMUNITY THIS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS SB THREE FIFTY ONE WOULD SEEK TO RIGHT THIS WRONG AND WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS IT THIS YEAR -- BY MAKING. DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES ELIGIBLE FOR TCC IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS RATHER THAN JUST THE PLANNING GRANTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FOR TODAY. AND THEN FINALLY TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE METHANE NITROUS OXIDE AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN COMMUNITIES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY. TO AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS WE NEED TO SEE EFFECTIVE SMART AND STRONG REGULATIONS THAT REDUCE FERTILIZER OVER APPLICATION AND BEGIN TO REDUCE. DAIRY HERD SIZES STELLAR TO LEVELS WHERE PROTECTING AIR QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY IS FEASIBLE AND PRACTICABLE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ARE A I APPRECIATE THE LAPPING MESSAGE THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE. LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND A MORE MEANINGFUL WAY AND ALLOW THEM TO STEER OF BOTH THE IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS. HOW THAT WORK FOR THEM AND THE WORK WE STILL HAVE TO DO -- AS THE STATE'S FIGURE THAT OUT -- IN ADDITION YOU YOU SPOKE ABOUT -- METHANE EMISSIONS AND SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS WITH WITH DAIRIES -- WITH THIRTY DAY JUSTICE OUT THERE. THEY NEED MENTION DRY MANY ARE MANAGEMENT AND ARE THERE OTHER. OF SOLUTIONS THAT YOU RECOMMEND OTHER THAN THE DRIVE MANY ARE MANAGEMENT THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT YEAH SO THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST AS BACKGROUND. TO REALIZE THAT THESE THEIR DIGESTERS -- CAN ONLY CAPTURE METHANE OVER DERRY LAGOON. SO THAT IT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE METHANE PUZZLE FOR TERRY'S BUT IT'S NOT ALL OF IT -- SO THERE'S OTHER -- MINORE MANAGEMENT THAT OCCURS AT TERRY'S AND THESE STARED ADJUSTERS DON'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THAT MANY ARE MANAGEMENT OUTSIDE THE LAGOONS. AND IT ALSO HAS NO IMPACT ON INTERROGATIONS -- FROM THE COUCH THEMSELVES -- SO IN ADDITION TO DRIVING OR MANAGEMENT WHICH THE STATUS STARTED INVEST AND PROBABLY NEEDS TO DO MORE. BUT ALSO JUST REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVED PRACTICES AROUND DRIVING OR MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION OF THAT THOUGH WE NEED TO TAKE A STRONG LOOK AT DAIRY HERD SIZES WITHIN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY -- THOSE HERD SIZES BASED ON A REPORT FROM THE DAIRY INDUSTRY ITSELF IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ARE BASICALLY INCOMPATIBLE RIGHT NOW WITH WATER QUALITY PROTECTION THAT THE DAIRY INDUSTRY DID -- MONITORING REPORT THAT CAME OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR THE CONCLUSION OF THAT REPORT IS THAT ALL DERRY'S WITHIN THIS MONITORING PROGRAM WHICH IS DISTRICT BE REPRESENTED. OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL OF THOSE AREAS WERE POLLUTING GROUNDWATER. AND THE SOLUTIONS TO THAT PROBLEM RECOMMENDED BY THE DAIRY INDUSTRY'S REPORT WERE ONE FIGURE OUT WAYS TO EXPORT THIS MAN OR IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN BE SOLD. FOR IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND THEN AS A SECOND RECOMMENDATION FROM THEIR INDUSTRIES REPORT LOOK AT HEARD SIZES BECAUSE WE'RE AND SO A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE SOME BERRIES HAVE TEN THOUSAND HOUSE OR MORE YOU HAVE THAT MANY COWS THERE'S JUST NOT ANYTHING YOU CAN DO WITH THE DAIRYMAN NORTH THAT'S NOT GOING TO POLLUTE. BOTH AIR QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY SO A STRONG LOOK AT THEIR HURTS US IS. SO CAN -- WE TALK ABOUT THE LAGOONS VERSUS THE HURT SIZE. DRAMMEN OR WHAT HOW MUCH. AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA YET ON THESE THIRTY DAY JUSTICE. AWESOME LET'S SAY THAT MAYBE THEY DO WORK FOR NOT. LATE ENOUGH DATA TO SEE THAT'S TRUE OR NOT -- BUT WHAT KIND OF WHAT. WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF A PORTION THAT'S NOT IN THE LAGOONS HOW MUCH ABOUT THE NEVER LEAVING BEHIND OF ONLY FOCUSING ON TERRY THAT JESTERS. I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBER -- FOUR MANEUVER MANAGEMENT THOUGH THE PORTION THAT'S LAGOONS THAN THE PORTION THAT'S OUTSIDE OF LAGOONS -- BUT IT'S 29% OF THE TOTAL STATE WIDE -- METHANE INVENTORY IS -- LAGOONS AND OTHER MEN OR MANAGEMENT AND 26% IS ENTERIC EMISSIONS OF I GOT THAT RIGHT I CONFLICT. I'M OKAY FOR OUR READY IN A TIME SUCH MAYBE MY ONLY QUESTION MICHAEL BUT THANK YOU I DO HAVE MORE QUESTIONS FOR IN THE FUTURE BUT SOME OF THIS METHANE STUFF IN THERE THAT JUST OR SO. FOLLOW UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WE WILL NOW WRAP UP OUR PRESENTATIONS AND ALLOW PUBLIC COMMENT. WELCOME TO COME UP I HAD A FOUR PM GOAL WHICH I CLEARLY HAVE EXCEEDED AND WILL EXCEED IT WILL GIVE YOU THE TIME. THAT YOU NEED 2% YOU'VE BEEN PATIENTS WHOEVER WANTS TO SPEAK AND SPEAK. I WOULD JUST ASK YOU THAT HE TRIED TO BE S. CONDENSE AS POSSIBLE BUT I WON'T CUT ANYONE OFF THANK YOU. THE IS CONDENSED AS POSSIBLE MICHAEL BOCA DOOR ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT DIED JESTERS WE'D LIKE TO BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION A LOT OF THE INFORMATION YOU HEARD TODAY. MAY NOT BE ACCURATE WE HAVE VERY GOOD NUMBERS ON HOW MUCH. JERRY ARE REDUCING THEIR METHANE EMISSIONS IT'S ROUGHLY FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN THE NEWER AND ENTERIC THE PART THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE CAL. THERE'S NO WAY OF REDUCING METHANE DIRECTLY FROM THE COW TODAY. OF THE CERTAIN THINGS BEING RESEARCHED AND REVIEWED BY FTA AND OTHERS BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT WE'RE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB WERE RUDE AND THE DERRY DIGEST A PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. IS BY FAR THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT STATE IS CURRENTLY INVESTING IN. ITS REDUCING MORE TOTAL GHG THAN ANY OTHER PROGRAM INCLUDING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE FAR MORE FUNDING. AND SO SUGGESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD QUIT FUNDING GEHRY DIED JESTERS IS DIRECTLY CON SKIS ME CONTRARY TO OUR GHG GOALS AND METHANE REDUCTION GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. MORE IMPORTANTLY. REDUCING HERD SIZES IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT GONNA REDUCE METHANE. SIMPLY GOING TO SHIFT NOTHING PRODUCTION AND INCREASE IT BY PUTTING IT IN OTHER STATES THAT ARE NOT REDUCING METHANE TOTAL DEMAND FOR GERRY IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA REDUCES HERD SIZES. ARE HERDS ARE COMING DOWN HERE BECAUSE WE'RE LOSING DAIRIES WITH THESE FIFTY TO SIXTY DERRY'S EVERY YEAR. IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE FIRST TIME OR HEARD TOTAL HURT CALIFORNIA'S REDUCING. SO WE WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATIVE OF BEING PART OF ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION SO THAT WE'RE GETTING ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE DAIRY INDUSTRY'S DOING TO REDUCE METHANE IT'S ACTUALLY A TREMENDOUSLY POSITIVE STORY. WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE. Q. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. NOT. FIFTEEN NON IDEA APPRECIATE EVERYONE MAKING TIME FOR THIS -- UP DATA MISS MISS NICHOLS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE UPDATE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE UPDATE. IN THE FUTURE AND CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS OUT THERE EVERYONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED
