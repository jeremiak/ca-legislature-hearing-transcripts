WE WANT. TO JUST THANK EVERYBODY FOR COMING TODAY TO OUR ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON AGING CALIFORNIA TRADE AND INVESTMENT -- WE ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE ON JOBS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE ECONOMY FOR TWENTY HOSTED THIS YEAR WE HAVE. TONY SIMONS HERE WHO'S THE CONSULTANT FROM THE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO WANT TO THANK THEM THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPORT THAT YOU SEE -- PRODUCE REALLY TALKING ABOUT. THE SITUATION IN THE IMPACT OF THE U. S. CHINA TERRACE ON OUR ECONOMY -- THIS IS THE FAST SIXTY YEAR I'VE BEEN CHAIRING THIS ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE AT THE SELECT COMMITTEE. AND REALLY -- BUT THE HOPE OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE WAS TO BE IDENTIFIED IN TO TALK ABOUT. THE VERY IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND ALL THE VARIOUS ASIA TRADING PARTNERS -- OBVIOUSLY IN A IS ONE OF THOSE MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS FORTUNATELY -- STARTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'VE BEEN IN A TRADE WAR WHERE THE UNITED STATES HAS -- PATEROS ON A VARIETY OF CHINESE GOOD OVER OVER THAT TIME ALMOST MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED CHINESE GOODS AND THEN. CHINA HAS THEN FOR RETALIATED PRIMARILY ON AGRICULTURAL GOODS WHICH IS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WHAT REALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN. IS CALIFORNIA. HE IS A HUGE IN CHINA AS A HUGE ANY PARTNER FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S OUR THIRD LARGEST TRADING PARTNER AFTER CANADA AND MEXICO -- IT'S WE EXPORT NEARLY THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION GOODS TO CHINA -- AND AGAIN MOST OF THOSE EXPORTS ARE NOT FROM LARGE COMPANIES ARE FROM SMALL COMPANIES 96% OF ALL K. TWENTY EXPORTS COME FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED. COMPANIES UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THE TERRORISTS HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT WAS SEEN -- SOME NEGATIVE IMPACT THE PORTAL THE SENTENCES ON THAT EXPORTS TO CHINA HAVE DECREASED BY 25%. IN DATA FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU HAS SAID THAT THE VALUE OF CHINESE EXPORTS. CALIFORNIA'S PUSH TO CHINA HAS PLEASE BY A BILLION TO BUY BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE. SO AGAIN WHAT WE SEE IS A VERY -- SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IN PARTICULAR AGRICULTURAL GOODS HAD BEEN. HIT THE HARDEST -- WE SAW THERE'S A 25% DECREASE IN WINE EXPORTS FROM THE US [INAUDIBLE] TO CHINA. WITH. 90% OF THOSE EXPORTS BEING FROM OFF. SO WE KNOW THAT THE AGRICULTURE. IN THE WINE INDUSTRY ARE REALLY GETTING HIT THE HARDEST. SO TODAY'S HEARING IS REALLY TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO DO CALIFORNIA WANTS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A? VERY STRONG ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA. WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A VERY OPEN RELATIONSHIP TO CONTINUE WANTED. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO A POSITIVELY IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. AGAIN I I WERE STARTED EARLIER BY SAYING NINE IS OUR THIRD LARGEST TRADING PARTNER -- WE KNOW THAT CONSUMERS ARE IMPACTED BY THESE DOES BECAUSE CONSIDER BUYING BETTER IMPLEMENTED IN FROM CHINA ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. AND THEN WE ALSO SEE THE CONTINUED THE CONCERN ABOUT THE LOSS OF POTENTIAL JOBS ESPECIALLY IN THAT HARBOR CULTURE INDUSTRY. I'M VERY HONORED HONORED TO BE JOINED BY OUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR A LADY COULD UNLOCK THE SUIT TODAY IS ARE ACTING GOVERNOR BECAUSE OUR GOVERNOR IS OUT OF TOWN. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF PROCLAMATIONS THERE. ARE CERTAIN ACTIONS TO TAKE TODAY REALLY -- I'M VERY HONORED THAT HE'S HERE SHE IS -- REALLY GOING TO BE TAKING THE LEAD FOR OUR STATE. ON MARCH. KNOW HOW TRADE AND INVESTMENT WILL BE WORKING AS WELL AS OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL OUR TREES SO I JUST WANTED. TO TURN OVER TO OUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. SORRY THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SOME REMEMBER TING IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS TO CALIFORNIA. FROM. CHANGING FEDERAL TRADE POLICIES. AND THE DISPUTE WITH CHINA. I'D LIKE TO START BY NOTING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE U. S. CONGRESS HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO STEP TRADE POLICY FOR THE NATION. UNDER ARTICLE ONE OF THE US CONSTITUTION. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND OUR INTER DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN TRADE FEDERAL TRADE POLICY IMPACTS CALIFORNIA DISPROPORTIONATELY TO OTHER STATES. THAT'S WHY THIS HEARING IS SO IMPORTANT BY ENTERING INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD TESTIMONY FROM EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS HERE TODAY. THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THE TERROR. BE WITH CHINA ON OUR STREETS ECONOMY AND THE CONCERNS THAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE EXPRESSING. AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE THE TEST IS WITH CHINA INITIATED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. HAS BEEN DEEPLY DISRUPTIVE TO STATE CALLED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. A LARGE PART OF THE DISRUPTION HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE WAY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING ITSELF. PRESIDENT TRUMP REGULARLY USES TWITTER TO ANNOUNCE OR THREATENED TARIFFS WHICH HE SOMETIMES FOLLOWS THROUGH ONE AND SOMETIMES DOESN'T. THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS PROCESS ALONE HAS CAST A DARK SHADOW ON THE RELIABILITY OF U. S. PRODUCTS AS PART. OF GLOBAL SUPPLY CHANGE ACROSS INDUSTRIES. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY UP FRONT THAT ALTHOUGH DONALD TRUMP REGULARLY STATES THAT CHINA IS PAYING THE TERRACE HE HAS IMPOSED. IT IS ACTUALLY AMERICAN CONSUMERS WHO ARE PAYING THE PRICE AND SO FAR PAYING DEARLY. SO I'D LIKE TO START THIS MORNING'S PRESENTATION BY GOING THROUGH A BRIEF TIMELINE OF MAJOR EVENTS SO FAR IN THE ESCALATING TRADE DISPUTE. JUST TO HELP ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR TODAY'S HEARING. THE FIRST SOUND THAT WAS BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION IMPOSED A 25% TARIFF. ON IMPORTED STEEL AND 10% TARIFF ON IMPORTED ALUMINUM HE CLAIMED TO BE TO DO SO UNDER SECTION TWO THIRTY TWO OF THE TRADE EXPANSION ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY TWO SECTION TWO THIRTY TO ESTABLISH AS THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENT TO LEVY TARIFFS. ON THE GROUNDS OF NATIONAL SECURITY. IN OTHER WORDS PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMED THAT STEEL AND ALUMINUM IMPORTS NOT JUST IN CHINA BUT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CANADA AND MEXICO. POST A CREDIBLE SECURITY THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY. THE TWO THIRTY TWO TERMS BECAUSE THE PRICE OF ALUMINUM AND STEEL IN THE U. S. TO SEARCH AND HAD NO IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OUR AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. ACCORDING TO THE PETERSON INSTITUTE TWO THIRTY TWO TERRACE INCREASE THE PRICE OF STEEL IN THE U. S. BY ABOUT 10%. THAT'S ABOUT AN ELEVEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR PER YEAR COST TO THE US ECONOMY. ON MAY NINETEENTH AFTER FOURTEEN MONTHS IN PLACE THE ADMINISTRATION GAVE EXEMPTIONS TO MEXICO AND CANADA AS PART OF NEGOTIATIONS OVER US MCA. THE TRADE AGREEMENT WHICH IF ADOPTED WILL REPLACE NAFTA. TWO THIRTY TWO STEPS. STEEL AND ALUMINUM HOWEVER ARE STILL IN PLACE FOR CHINA. AND THE PRICE OF STEEL IN THE US HAS NOT COME DOWN ON IN SPITE OF THE EXEMPTIONS FOR CANADA AND MEXICO. THE TWO THIRTY TWO TERMS ARE ALSO INCIDENTALLY STILL IN PLACE FOR IMPORTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION I ROB LIKE OF COURSE SINCE THE E. U. IS HOME TO MOST OF OUR NATO ALLIES. SO TWO MONTHS AFTER THE TWO THIRTY TWO TAPS WERE IMPOSED IN MAY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TRADE DISPUTE WITH CHINA RAMPED UP WITH THE IMPOSITION OF SECTION THREE A ONE TERRACE. SECTION THREE A ONE OF THE US TRADE ACT NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AUTHORIZES THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE ALL APPROPRIATE ACTION INCLUDING RETALIATION. TO OBTAIN THE REMOVAL OF ANY ACT POLICY OR PRACTICE. OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT IS UNJUSTIFIED UNREASONABLE BUT DISCRIMINATORY AND THE BURDENS OR RESTRICTS US COMMERCE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SECTION THREE ARE ONE INVESTIGATIONS DETERMINED THE CHILD. HAD REPEATEDLY VIOLATED THESE PROVISIONS US COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO DO BUSINESS IN CHINA HAVE LONG REPORTED INSTANCES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THREAT STAFFED FORCE JOINT VENTURES AND THE FAILURE TO LIVE UP TO AGREEMENTS. AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT SO LET ME JUST A FARM THE CHINA SECTION THREE ARE ONE VIOLATION. ALL REAL AND THEY ARE SERIOUS BUT WHILE THERE IS LITTLE DISPUTE ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE VIOLATIONS THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN. OVER HOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MOVED FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THAT. IN JULY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE US POST A 25% IMPORT TERRA ON THREE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND IMPORTS CHINESE CUTS. CHINA IMMEDIATELY RETALIATED WITH TARIFFS ON US IMPORTS THE SAME AMOUNT. A MONTH LATER THE US IMPOSED A SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF IMPORTS FROM CHINA. AND CHINA IMMEDIATELY RETALIATED WITH TARIFFS ON US EXPORTS IN THE SAME AMOUNT. ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN RESPONSE TO CHINA'S HOW YOU TORIE TERRACE THE US IMPOSED A 10% IMPORT TARIFF ON APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CHINESE CUTS. INCLUDING MANY EVERY DAY CONSERVE OUR PRODUCTS LIKE IT'S ELECTRONICS AND HOUSEWARES. CHINA AGAIN RETALIATED WITH TERRACE ON ANOTHER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS OF AMERICAN MADE PRODUCTS. IN DECEMBER PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED -- NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA AND CLEARED THE SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTH S. WILL REMAIN AT CREATING A PARTIAL REPRIEVE. IN MAY TWENTY NINETEEN SO JUST ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THAT NEGOTIATIONS WERE MOVING TOO SLOWLY. AND THE US INCREASED TERRACE. TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN CHINESE GOODS FROM 10% 225%. AS I NOTED AT THE START IT IS AMERICAN CONSUMERS WHO ARE PAYING THE PRICE OF THESE TERRORISTS NOT CHINA. AND THE IMPACT OF TERRACE UP TO THIS POINT IS ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN DOLLARS IN INCREASED COSTS FOR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD. SOON AFTER TRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS NOW CONSIDERING A TERROR CHINA WHICH HAD NOT UP TO THIS POINT IN IMPACTED. THESE RECORDS TO A STAGE FOR TERROR. THEY ARE MOSTLY CONSUMER ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS AND OUR ESTIMATED AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AT LAST MONTH'S G. TWENTY SUMMIT IN TOKYO CHINESE PRESIDENT XI CHING PAYING AND PRESIDENT TROP MATT. AND AGREE TO SEND THEIR TEAMS BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. THIS IS GOOD NEWS AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO CONCRETE AGREEMENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD HOLD OFF ON THE IMPOSITION. OF STAGE FOR TERRA AT LEAST FOR NOW. SO TODAY AS WE WAIT FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF ACTIVITY HERE IS WHAT WE NOW. 232- AND THREE OH ONE TERRACE TINIEST CUTS AND THE RETALIATORY TARIFFS IMPOSED BY CHINA. ARE IN PLACE THEY ARE HAVING SERIOUS IMPACTS ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. AND THEY'RE NOT LIKELY TO GO AWAY ANYTIME SOON. MEANWHILE THE THRESHOLD RATIONALE FOR THE THREE OH ONE WAS TO CREATE PRESSURE ON CHINA TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGES TO ADDRESS THREE OH ONE VIOLATIONS. AND ABSOLUTELY NO PROGRESS WHATSOEVER HAS BEEN MADE ON ISSUES SURROUNDING CHINA'S BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY WORRISOME FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY CALIFORNIA IS DEEPLY INTEGRATED INTO THE GLOBAL MARKETS AND SUPPLY CHAINS. OUR STATE RELIES ON OVER SIX HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TRADE EVERY YEAR. CALIFORNIA IS NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS. AND IN EXPORTS OF MACHINERY AND ELECTRONICS WE ALSO FIRST IN THE COUNTRY IN COMBINED GOODS AND SERVICES EXPORTS AND IMPORTS. CALIFORNIA'S TRADE INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXTENSIVE WE HAVE ELEVEN PORTS AND TWELVE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ROUTE THE STATE. THIRTEEN IF WE CAP TIJUANA WHICH IS CONNECTED TO SAN DIEGO VTC C. BACKS. THE LOS ANGELES THE LONG BEACH PORT COMPLEX IS THE NATION'S LARGEST CONTAINER PORT. IN EVERY DAY ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS COMING IN THROUGH ITS STOCKS. LOGISTICS FREIGHT WHERE HOUSING AND HE COMMERCE INDUSTRIES HAVE DEVELOPED AROUND CALIFORNIA'S INTERNATIONAL TRADE WITH HIS SCALE THAT IS UNMATCHED ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. RATE SUPPORTS ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAINS AND HIGHER WAGES FOR WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAINS. MANY CALIFORNIANS LIVELY BUT ARE TIED TO THE GOODS MOVEMENT INDUSTRY AND MORE BROADLY AN ESTIMATED 20% OF ALL THE JOBS IN STATE ARE DEPENDENT ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT. THAT'S ABOUT FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIA JOBS. AND THESE ARE GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS DOCKWORKERS WAREHOUSE WORKERS WELL WORKERS TRUCK DRIVERS BOAT CRUISE TRADE SPECIALISTS AND RETAILERS. IF THAT GOODS MOVEMENT FORCE THESE ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF TRADE SUPPORTING NO CLASS CALIFORNIA JOBS WITH DECENT WAGES. SO CALIFORNIA HAS A GREAT DEAL AT STAKE AND WE ARE ALREADY FEELING THE IMPACTS OF THE US CHINA TERRACE DISPUTE. THE US CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ESTIMATED THAT OVER THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF CALIFORNIA EXPORTS THREATENED BY THE TERRORISTS. EXPORTS TO CHINA FROM CALIFORNIA PORTS WERE DOWN 9% YEAR TO DATE. TWENTY NINETEEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE PORT OF LONG BEACH TOLD US THAT IN MAY OF THIS YEAR. CAN TRAIN CONTAINER TRADE WITH CHINA BOTH IMPORTS AND EXPORTS WAS DOWN BY 18% FROM THE SAME MONTH ONE YEAR EARLIER. ASSEMBLYMAN TANG I THINK THAT YOU ACTUALLY JUST AT RELATE SOME UPDATED INFORMATION AROUND THE SAME NUMBERS. JOBS CONNECTED TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE AREN'T JUST ALONG THE COAST BUT IN INLAND AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL. RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE SUFFERING DISPROPORTIONATELY AS RURAL INDUSTRIES AGRICULTURE AND THE CHEST X. HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE TRADE FOR SHE CALIFORNIA HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AGRICULTURAL JOBS. 70% OF WHICH ARE IN RURAL AREAS THE INLAND EMPIRE NOW HOST AND MAJOR LOGISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION CLUSTER. DRIVING ALONG I.. FIVE SEE DOZENS OF LARGE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS NEARLY ALL OF WHICH HAVE TRADE SUPPORTER JOBS. IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA CROP CROPS HAVE BEEN KEY TARGETS PINE AS RETALIATORY TARIFFS AND THE EFFECTS CONTINUE [INAUDIBLE] THIS. MIKE CAL MAG. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS ENDED UP HEREBY APPROVE. IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA CROPS HAVE BEEN KEY TARGETS CHINA'S RETALIATORY TARIFFS AND THE EFFECTS CONTINUE. CONSIDER THE CASE OF ALMONDS. CALIFORNIA SUPPLIES 82% OF THE WORLD'S ALMONDS AND IT'S ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND GROWERS. ALMONDS ARE ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S TOP EXPORT COMMODITIES THE ALLMAN BOARD OF CALIFORNIA ESTIMATES THE INDUSTRY GENERATES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND JOBS IN THE STATE. CHINA IMPOSED 50% TARIFFS ON US OPENS IN THE ESCALATING TRADE WAR. JULIE ADAMS WITH THE ALLMAN BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. SAID YOU SEE THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT SINCE THE TERRORISTS WERE INTRODUCED LAST YEAR. SHE SAID THE FOR DECADES THE ALLMAN BOARD HAS BEEN MARKETING IN CHINA. TRYING TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT ALMONDS IN COOKING AND AS A SNACK. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TERRORIST EXPORTS TO CHINA. INCREASED BY ABOUT ONE THIRD. ACCORDING TO THE HARMON BOARD. AND IT'S NOT AS THOUGH OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SITTING IDLY BY. STRESS HAS A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA PROVIDING THE COUNTRY THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE CALIFORNIA ALMONDS THAT NOW CARRY TERRACE. THE AUSTRALIAN ALMOND BOARD REPORTED AN 88% INCREASE IN EXPORTS TO CHINA FROM BETWEEN. TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NOW TRUMP HAS ANNOUNCED A SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLAR AID PACKAGE FOR YOU -- FARMERS WHO'VE BEEN HURT BY THE CARRIAGE DISPUTE IT WAS INITIALLY DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO HELP FARMERS IN MIDWESTERN STATES. ALTHOUGH THE PACKAGE HAS BEEN REVISED TO INCLUDE MORE CALIFORNIA GROWN CROPS. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION PRESIDENT CHENEY JOHANNSEN RIGHTFULLY SAID. THAT THE LAST ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS WOULD BE TO RESOLVE THE TRADE DISPUTES AND RE OPEN MARKETS FOR CALIFORNIA FARM PRODUCTS. BOB ALSO WORKING TO COPE WITH HOW THEIR OPERATIONS ARE BEING FINANCIALLY IMPACTED. THE LOS ANGELES TIMES RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SOME FARMERS MAY NEED TO TAKE ON MORE OF THE SHIPPING COSTS TO MAKE UP THE INCREASE PRICES. WORST MAY ALSO CUT DOWN ON SPENDING ON EQUIPMENT AND FERTILIZER PERHAPS TO MAKING THE CHOICE TO GO REPLACING A TRACK -- OTHER BIG TICKET ITEMS. AS BECAUSE THE INVENTORY TO SLOW IT IS ALSO STRETCH THE CAPACITY A STORAGE FACILITY. THE EFFECT OF THE TRADE AND TERRACE DISPUTE WITH CHINA IS ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY OUT BY CALIFORNIA SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES. ACCORDING TO THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES AND FOR ANYA ARE GAUGE IN EXPERTS. AS A JUST A FEW YEARS AGO SMALL BUSINESSES WILL SPONSOR FOR OVER CALIFORNIA. DESPITE THE OUTSIZE ROLE CALIFORNIA SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES HEY IN THE STATE'S INTERNATIONAL TRADE. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES AS LARGE COMPANIES TO SHIP THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN OR FIND NEW INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS TO MAKE UP FOR LOST BUSINESS. THE US CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BASIS AB BASES OF TRADE CAMPAIGN FEATURES STORIES CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES IMPACTED BY THE TERRORISTS. AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW. SAUL CAM WHO OWNS AND OPERATES ITS WE PHAM ORGANICS LÀ MARANDA. IMPORT EXPORT FOOD AND STOPS TO AND FROM CHINA. MR CAM REPORTED THAT HIS COMPANIES ALREADY OPERATING ON VERY SMALL MARGIN. THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE TERRACE MEANS THAT HIS BUSINESS WILL ESSENTIALLY BE SHOT DOWN. MR K. PORTS THAT HIS EMPLOYEES NO JOBS I TRIED TO THE TO THE TRADE DISPUTES. AND IT IS VERY SAD REALITY FOR MR CAM AND HIS WORKERS. CHAD MAKE ANY OF SAN DIEGO FOUNDED A COMPANY CALLED DRY START A BUSINESS THE DEVELOPS. TAX. CHAD TESTED NEARLY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF HIS OWN SAVINGS TO HELP FOUND THE COMPANY. AND HE SPENT FROM INSPECTING CHINESE FACTORIES AND ESTABLISHING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHINESE MANUFACTURER. TO FINALIZE PRODUCTION OF HIS SURFBOARD BACKS. WHAT'S MORE CHAD COMPANY IS DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING CHARTER ENTERPRISES WITH THEIR PROFIT. BUT DESPITE STRONG PRE CELL NUMBERS FOR TRY START SUPPORT BACKS CHATS COMPANY IS HAVING A HARD TIME STAYING AFLOAT. THANKS TO THE TERRORISTS. SMALL COMPANIES LIKE WE FARM AND TRY START STRUGGLING GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE TAX HEAD ON THEIR PRODUCTS WE SHOULD EXPECT TO HER MANY MORE STORIES LIKE THESE. SO LONG AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S TRADE POLICIES CAN YOU ON THIS TRACK. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONCE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS ARE JUST WRAPPED IT. IT IS VERY HARD TO GET THEM. FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA WINE EXPORTS TO CHINA FELL NEARLY 25% AFTER TAXES AND TARIFFS ON US WINE ENTERING CHINA REACHED NEARLY. 80%. DEMAND HAS QUICKLY BEEN ABSORBED INCREASED EXPORTS FROM CHILE AND AUSTRALIA THAT IT'S IN THEIR WINE EXPORTS TO CHINA SEARCH. LET ME SAY FOR THE RECORD THEIR WINE IS NOT AS GOOD AS CALIFORNIA. ONE FINALLY THESE TERRORISTS ARE IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO MEET OTHER CHALLENGES WE FACE IN THIS STATE. CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A MAJOR HOUSING CRISIS AND THE TERRORISTS HAVE HIT THE HOMEBUILDING INDUSTRY HEART. ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES. ALREADY ADDED ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE COST OF US HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. SO IN CONCLUSION. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL. SEE AN END TO THESE TRADE DISPUTES ANYTIME SOON. AND OUR STATE MUST PREPARE FOR PROLONGED IMPACTS. NOW THAT THE PROCEDURE HAS GONE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST CHINA ON THREE OH ONE VIOLATIONS. THERE WAS BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND TELL THERE IS MEANINGFUL RESOLUTION OF THE ORIGINAL VIOLATIONS BY CHINA. BUT EVEN LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY INVOLVED AND CHINA'S RECENT SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO BET ON SOME KEY PROVISIONS. THIS COULD TAKE A LONG TIME. AND THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THESE ISSUES TO RESOLVE MEANS MORE MONEY COMING OUT OF CALIFORNIA POCKETS. A STUDY EARLIER THIS YEAR AS I MENTIONED BEFORE FOUND THAT THE IMPACT OF THE TERRORIST BUT REQUIRE A FAMILY OF FOUR TO FIND AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN DOLLARS A YEAR. TO PAY FOR INCREASED COSTS OF CURRENT. THAT'S MONEY THE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES CAN BETTER SPENT ELSEWHERE. AND OF COURSE THE IMPACTS TO CALIFORNIA COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO STAY AFLOAT AND CONTINUE TO IMPORT TO CHINA. IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IS VERY VERY SERIOUS. SO WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND I AM HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF IT WE'RE HOPING TO DO IS. YEAH EVERYBODY SPEAK AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE. DIALOGUE ON THE ISSUE -- BUT REALLY APPRECIATE THEM THE GOVERNOR FROM MUCH HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA. AND I I BELIEVE HIGHLAND PARK IN PARTICULAR ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THE P. TO BUSINESSES THAT REALLY. ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY SO THANK YOU.

DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA IF YOU DO NOT KNOW MULTI YOU ARE NOT A CHINA HAND -- BUT WE'VE -- THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH THEM TO EXPAND THE TICKET HERE IN THE US AND THE US THE MULTI DAY -- WHICH IS A CELEBRATION SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN OF WE'VE WORKED WITH CHUNG DO THIS IF TELL DO SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT SINCE ONE IS NOT THIS ONE FOOD BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY JOHN CHIANG AND TALKING TO RIGHT. THE WHOLE OF THE PANDA -- AND WE'VE ACTUALLY WHAT WOULD BY DUE TO BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS IS. AS WE ALL KNOW -- PART OF OUR SOUL IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SILICON VALLEY AND CHINA IS GREATLY IS CATCHING UP IN SOME SOME MAY SAY EVEN SURPASSING US. BUT BY DO HAS BEEN ONE OF THEIR STRONG. ANCHORS IN CHINA AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH THEM TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXPLORE PARTNERSHIPS IN THE US. FROM THE ALBUM PERSPECTIVE WHAT PEOPLE SAY HEY DON'T YOU TWO DELEGATIONS AND WE SAY YES WE'VE DONE THAT. DID YOU FISH AND SEE WE WE ARE ACTUALLY -- TOOK THE COMMISSIONER OF OF OF ENERGY RIGHT -- I FORGET THE NAME OF SORRY BUT WE WENT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THEN -- WE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE ACTUALLY START THAT IN TAKING DELEGATES FROM PARIS IS GOING TO BE AREA TO CHINA TO LOOK AT EXPLORE. PARTNERSHIPS -- WORK AND BRINGING INVESTMENT TO US HOW WOMEN TWENTY THIRTEEN I SHOULD PASS WE DID TO THE FIRST INVESTING U. S. REAL ESTATE SUMMIT -- WITH THEN AMBASSADOR GARY LAW IN BEIJING IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST ONES AT THE TIME THAT WAS EVER DONE AND I TELL YOU WHEN I ARRIVED IN BEIJING WE HAD THE SUMMIT. I REMEMBER IT WAS ON MONDAY I CAME BACK ON TUESDAY ON WEDNESDAY ALREADY HAD A CLIENT FLYING IN TO SERVICES GOING THING I'M READY TO LOOK AT ALL THE PROJECT YOU TALKED ABOUT. AND THAT CLIENT NOW HAS IN THE ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA ALONE HE IS NOT GOING TO ANY OTHER STATE. WHICH IS GREAT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HE CONTINUES -- TO INVEST IN THIS GREAT STATE -- WE HAVE ACTUALLY DIVERSIFIED A LITTLE BIT KNOWING THAT -- REAL ESTATE EVEN THOUGH WE SAY THE CHINESE INVESTED AND BROUGHT UP AND RAISED ON THE PRICES THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT ACTUALLY THE WHO ARE PURCHASING PROPERTY. THE CONSUMER IS LEFT TENTH 12% OF THOSE CONSUMERS AREN'T TRAINEES OR FOREIGN NATIONALS ACTUALLY IS THE LOCALS IF I TECHIES WHO ARE MAKING MONEY AND HELPING OUR ECONOMY SO I LIKE TO ALWAYS. I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT AND LET PEOPLE KNOW. AND THEN RECENTLY THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS CALLED TO LEAVE CHINA -- WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT A DELEGATION OF START UPS FROM SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA EVEN WENT AS FAR AS COMING FROM NEW YORK. AND WE BOUGHT THIRTEEN START TO CHINA THIS YEAR EARLIER THIS YEAR -- BECAUSE WE WANT IT CHINA TO SEE WHAT START UPS ARE LIGHT IN THE FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA -- AND WE WON AT THE LOCAL STARBUCKS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FROM THEM IN CHINA. WHETHER IT BE OPENING A MARKET WHETHER IT BE MANUFACTURING SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE PART OF THEIR PRODUCT LINE -- OR WHETHER IT BE FINDING PARTNERS AND INVESTORS IN CHINA OR BRINGING THEM INTO THE US. WHAT ARE WE FOCUSED ON -- AND WHY IS IT NECESSARY FOR WHAT WE FOCUSED ON I SHOULD SAY -- MOVING FORWARD AND WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO AYE EVEN HALF CHINESE INVESTMENT BECAUSE CHINA HAS BEEN A PARTNER AND ALREADY WE'VE HEARD THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE IS A TRADE DEFICIT AND THERE'S A HUGE IMPACT. CHINESE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT IN KICK STARTING. OUR ECONOMY MANY WAYS AND SOME PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND. FUNKY CAME ON BOARD AND THEY ACTUALLY STARTED BUILDING THE CONDOS AND SOUTH OF MARKET -- I REMEMBER WHEN A PICK AT NO ALSO KNOWN AS THING HIGH E. THEY BOUGHT STRESS PROPERTIES AND SOUTH OF MARKET -- AND MEN AND FIVE HOTELS GAVE PEOPLE JOBS. AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP THE ECONOMY -- AND OTHER COMPANIES. SUCH AS OCEAN WIDE AND THEY WERE ABLE TO START AND BUILD AND BREAK GROUND ON TWO MILLION SQUARE FEET. IN OUR TRANSMIT TERMINAL. BEFORE THAT TIME THERE WAS REALLY NO MOVEMENT IN THE TRANSKEI AREA. AND GREY EAGLE DOING BUSINESS AS SPECIFIC EAGLE IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND ALL THEY DID WAS HOLD ON TO THEIR STABILIZE ASSETS BUT REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW IT IS TIME FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. AND THEY DID BY LAND GREENFIELD AND THEY ARE DEVELOPING. AND THEY ACTUALLY STE ARE ALMOST AND AND THEY ARE DEVELOPING ACTUALLY THREE PROJECT ONE IS ALREADY COMPLETED IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND EVEN THOUGH THE VIDEO SACRAMENTO I WANTED TO ADD BECAUSE MY FRIEND MADE SURE I SAID SOMETHING. IN SACRAMENTO THE KING'S STADIUM HAS -- ACTUALLY PARTNERED WITH FOREIGN INVESTORS. OUT AND BROUGHT IN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO DEVELOP SACRAMENTO DOWNTOWN AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK FOR ECONOMY NOT JUST RESONANCES GO. BACK CALIFORNIA. LOOKING FORWARD WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT NOW WITH THIS -- CHECK A TERRACE WAR. WE'RE LOOKING AT FOOD WE'RE LOOKING AT FOOD TECH WE'RE LOOKING UP WHILE WE'RE LOOKING AT FOOD SECURITY. AND OTHER MARKETS WELL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW AS GLOBAL AS SOUTH AND EVEN THOUGH WE STILL HAVE CHINA CHINA WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS -- AND AND MOVE FORWARD. THIS YEAR WE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE ALREADY TOOK A DELEGATION AND KINDA LOOKING AT BRINGING -- START UPS TO CHINA HOWEVER WE ARE IT WITH FOOD TECH TAKING A DELEGATION TO SINGAPORE AND HONG KONG TO TALK ABOUT FOOD TECH AND BRING FOOD TECHNOLOGY TO ASIA. AND LOOK THE CHINA MARKET. AND IN NOVEMBER WE ALSO TAKING A DELEGATION TO SHANGHAI TO PARTICIPATE AT THE IMPORT EXPO SO AND WE'RE BRINGING FOOD COMPANIES AS WELL SO WE ARE LOOKING EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A TEAR FOR WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHINA MARKET IS INFORMED. AND EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON ESPECIALLY IN THE FOOD IN IN FOOD WORLD AND IN SECURITY BECAUSE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE GROWTH IN CHINA AND ALSO TO THE US. OTHER MARKETS OUTSIDE OF CHINA I ONLY SAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DIVERSIFY WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT ASIA OF COURSE. RIGHT WHETHER BE NORTH AND SOUTH EAST ASIA INDIA IS AN IMPORTANT MARKET FOR US -- LATIN AMERICA AUSTRALIA THE MIDDLE EAST EUROPE AND EASTERN EUROPE AND I SHOULD KNOW THAT OF COURSE WITH THE ONE BUILT ONE ROAD INITIATIVE THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHERE CHINA'S GOING. AND ALSO PARTNERED WITH THEM AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE LATIN AMERICA WE ARE TAKING A DELEGATION OF FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LATIN AMERICA IN SEPTEMBER. BECAUSE AND THE THING IS WE ALSO KNOW THAT CHINA HAS BEEN SENDING A LOT OF COMPANIES TO INVEST IN SOUTH AMERICA AS WELL. SO WE ARE WE ARE AND AND SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A TREND THERE BUT WE DEFINITELY WORKING. AND WITH THAT I THINK I FINISH MY COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. STEPHEN CHUNK WHO'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER LOS ANGELES [INAUDIBLE] CHAU. THANK YOU SOME TEN FROM BITING ME -- TO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES REGION AND THANK YOU FOR THE GOVERNOR FOR SUPPORTING US SO MUCH WITHOUT LOS ANGELES IN MULTIPLE EVENTS AND THE COULD JESSICA FOR THE INVITATION -- AS WE TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA I THINK SOMETIMES WE THINK OF LOS -- CALIFORNIA'S A WHOLE BLOCK AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEPARATE A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S MY IN FRONT OF YOU -- YOU SEE A A COUPLE SLIDE JUST TO REMIND. US OF THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES ARE GROWING THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA REGION AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TO THE WORLD THAT WE SEE THE VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE SO FAR SOMEONE A HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE FACTS ABOUT LOS ANGELES AND TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CHINA. AND WHAT IT MEANS TO US AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE THE CHURCH -- THE TARIFFS AND A TRADE WAR. SO FIRST -- LE PEN JUST COUNTY A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT OUR GDP LAST YEAR REACH A STAGGERING EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IF ONE SANDERS COUNTY ALONE WERE COUNTRY WE WOULD BE THE NINETEENTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. I THINK PEOPLE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BUT THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT WE HAVE MANY NATIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA WITH THE SIZES -- MANY NATIONS AS WELL AND IN SEVEN CALIFORNIA ALL TOGETHER TO TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE RG PIECE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS. EQUATING TO HAVE A LOT OF LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THAT'S THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE REASON WHY WE DO SO WELL WITH OUR OUR G. P.. AND THERE WAS INDUSTRY SECTORS ARE GROWING SO STRONGLY IS BECAUSE OF OUR NATIONAL TIES WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE ASIA PACIFIC. THERE ARE OVER A MILLION JOBS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PART OF LOS AS AS PART OF LONG BEACH HAS SUPPORTED -- BY THE ACTIVITIES ARE GOING ON AT THE PORTS AS LEVEL WITHIN THE GOVERNOR AND THE SENATE MEMBERS MENTIONED EARLIER THE PLAY LOS ANGELES IS THE NUMBER ONE CONTAINER PORTS IN NORTH AMERICA THE PORT OF LONG BEACH IS A SECOND CONTENT -- LÀ LARGEST CONTAINER PORTS IN NORTH AMERICA COMBINED TOGETHER THE NINTH LARGEST. COMPLEX IN THE WORLD. THESE TWO PORTS A LOCAL CONTROL OVER 40% OF OCEAN GOING CARGO COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES. LOS ANGELES ALONE CONTROLS 43%. OF THE GOODS COMING IN. THE AND WE CONSUME A PARTIALLY. A SOME OF THE GOODS BUT THE REST OF MY ACTUALLY GOES TO THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES SO THE IMPACT IS NOT JUST LOCAL IS ACTUALLY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NATION. AND BESIDES -- WHEN IT COMES INTERNATIONAL TRADE BESIDES IMPORT EXPORT REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT FOR DIRECT INVESTMENT AS WELL? AND WE ARE AT THE WAITRESS IN A LOS ANGELES AND A LITTLE SAID JUST COUNTY ECONOMIC I'M CORPORATION WE DO AN ANNUAL ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER OF FOREIGN ON THE SELFISHNESS LOCATE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO REPORTS THAT -- LAST YEAR OVER TEN THOUSAND FOR KNOWN FORMS AND SEVEN CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTING DIRECTLY TO OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS. IN EVERY YEAR THESE PHONE ON THE SABBATH SHIPMENTS. LOCAL WAGES OF OVER THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE IMPACT THAT FOREIGN INVESTMENTS HAVE ON OUR REGION. ON TOP OF THAT THE TRADING LOGISTICS SECTOR WE SUPPORT DIRECTLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND JOBS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT OVER A MILLION JOBS ARE DIRECTLY SUPPORTED BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE. AND AS REMOVING FOR THIS -- WHAT WITH THE REPORT ITSELF FOCUS ON MANUFACTURING? AND MANY FOLKS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES FORGET THAT CALIFORNIA AND LOS ANGELES A PARTICULAR -- I HAVE VERY STRONG MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES IN FACT LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS THE NUMBER ONE COUNTY IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND MANUFACTURING JOBS LOOK AT WRITING LÀ. I COUNTY ALONE COMBINED WITH THE REST OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A HUGE IMPACT AND WE MANUFACTURE WE DON'T JUST PRODUCE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH WE HAVE TO IMPORT A LOT OF THE COMPONENT PARTS. ESPECIALLY FOR MY PARTNERS IN ASIA AND THE STREET PTEROPUS ACTUALLY HAVING A HUGE IMPACT WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT A BIT LATER. AS WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THESE FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE COMING AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT THEY'RE CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND ALSO SATAN JOBS OUT MY HAVE LEFT US -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THERE'S A COMPANY -- NESTLE -- THEY OWN -- A PRODUCT THAT HE GETS BY A VERY TO BILLY WHAT'S HOT POCKETS. BECAUSE YOU SEE BE MANUFACTURED RIGHT IN LOS ANGELES IN CHATSWORTH TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY JOBS ARE SO SUPPORT THIS OPERATION THEY DECIDE TO MOVE THE MANUFACTURING PLANT TO KENTUCKY. AND SO WE WERE REALLY STRESS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAPPEN TO THESE MANUFACTURING JOBS AND THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE LIVING IN CHATSWORTH. AND THAT'S WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO RECRUIT A CHINESE COMPANIES AND THERE. CAME IN AND BASICALLY WERE ABLE TO TRANSFORM THE MANUFACTURING PLANTS TO MAKE CHINESE DUMPLINGS. THAT ARE NOW SOLD IN NINETY NINE RANCH MARKET AND IN A FROZEN DUMPLINGS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WHAT A GREAT WAY TO SAVE THE JOBS AND REALLY CATER TO THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL POPULATION. ANOTHER COMPANY SB RIGHTY -- FROM CHANGE AND OUR CHECK BOB THAT'S MANUFACTURE THAT'S COME TO LOS ANGELES AND OPEN NOT ONLY THE NORTH AMERICAN HEADQUARTERS BUT THEIR MANUFACTURING CENTER LANCASTER WITHIN PLAN THAT RATE WAS HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND THROUGH THAT AND THROUGH YEARS OF REALLY DEVELOPMENT THEY'RE ABLE TO CREE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MANUFACTURING JOBS. GOOD PAYING MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THAT LOCATION THAT WAS REALLY DESPERATE FOR FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES. AND BECAUSE BE READY IS MAKING ELECTRIC BUSES AND THEY'RE GETTING CONTRACTS FROM LA COUNTY METRO WERE ABLE TO SEE IS OUT THERE AFTER A TRACKING OTHER COMPANIES. THERE'S A COMPANY CALLED TRITIUM FROM AUSTRALIA A SMALL ELECTRIC -- FESTERING STATION COMPANY I CAME TO LOS ANGELES SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE -- FOR B. Y. DE UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT DOCTOR CONNECTION HOWEVER THEY WERE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH THE TERROR AND OTHER ELECTRIC BUS MANUFACTURER NOW THIS COMPANY WHAT FROM TO EMPLOYEES TO TWENTY FOUR EMPLOYEES. SO THESE ARE JOB CREATION THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT THAT'S COMING IN. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON THE CHINESE INVESTMENT AS WELL -- A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY THINK OF LOS ANGELES THEY THINK CHINA IS USUALLY ARE NUMBER ONE TRADING ARE AT FOREIGN INVESTOR -- THEY ARE WHEN IT COMES TO THE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN COMING IN OVER THE YEARS HOWEVER WHEN WE COUNT THE NUMBER OF JOBS AND THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES ARE HERE CHINA'S JUST GROWING INTO INTO THE NUMBER EIGHT POSITION. OUR TOP INVESTORS SO JAPAN U. K. CANADA GERMANY. FRANCE SO CHINA'S MAKING LEAPS AND BOUNDS MOVING FORWARD AND OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IF YOU LOOK AT REPORT BY THE RHODIUM GROUP YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF NEW GREEN FIELD AND THAT'S COMING IN. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE OVER FIFTY THREE DEALS ACROSS CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTING ABOUT FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SIXTY SEVEN PROJECTS SIXTEEN POINT FOUR BILLION. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTY SIX PROJECT ONE BILLION UNFORTUNATELY LOST WE SAW A SHARP DECLINE. DURING BATTLE DEALS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A HUGE DROP. AND I SAID ONLY MENTION -- SOME THE PROJECTS ARE HAVING SAN FRANCISCO ALSO TRANSFORMING LOS ANGELES AS WELL -- OCEAN WHY GREENLAND ALL OF THESE COMPANIES ALSO INVESTING HEAVILY INTO LOS ANGELES CREATING NEW HOTELS IN NEW RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS AROUND DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AND GIVING US A REAL RENAISSANCE THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN YEARS. AS LOS ANGELES IS GETTING READY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPIC GAMES WILL BE HOSTING FOR THE THIRD TIME WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOTEL ROOMS TO SUPPORT -- TO TO TO REALLY SUPPORT THIS ENTIRE INFLUX OF TOYS AND COMING IN AND BESIDES EVERYBODY'S TALKING AT TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. WILL ALSO BE HOSTING -- OTHER MAJOR EVENTS LIKE -- THE NC DOUBLE A CHAMPIONSHIP THE US OPEN -- SO WE'RE GOING TO BE THE SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS WE NEED THE HOTEL ARE PROJECTS. ANNOUNCING THIS DECLINE IS REALLY AFFECTING US IN A NEGATIVE MANNER AND WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED. NOW BACK TO THIS AS A FOREIGN INVESTMENTS WE WHAT WE WERE TALKING A BIT MORE ABOUT IMPORT EXPORT AS LOW TECH GOVERNOR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TALKED ABOUT AS WELL. THE MESSAGES BECAUSE SINCE THE STRIKE LAST YEAR -- WE ARE AGAIN THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF STRICKEN UNITED STATES WENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO WAY TRADE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD OUR NUMBER ONE TRADING PARTNER CHINA. WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS INTO A TRADE WITH JUST WITH CHINA ALONE AND THIS IS WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS PORTS OF ENTRY AROUND THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGION. WHAT'S TWO NOTES WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT IF YOU ADD UP THE SECOND LARGEST TRADING PARTNER JAPAN -- NUMBER THREE WHICH IS KOREA. NUMBER FOUR NUMBER FIVE NUMBER SIX NUMBER SEVENTY ADDED FROM NUMBER TWO TO NUMBER TWELVE THEN THAT NUMBER EQUALLED IT'S WHAT WE TRADE WITH CHINA THAT'S THE IMPACT OF TRADE THAT WE HAVE WITH CHINA. SO THE SPEECH THERAPIST REALLY CONCERNING TO US BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING A DROP AS THE THE WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED BEFORE THE PART OF LOS ANGELES AND PART OF LONG BEACH. ALREADY REPORTED AND THE FOR SIX MONTHS A SIX POINT 7% -- THE DECREASE AND VOLUMES COMING INTO LOS ANGELES THIS IS IMPACTING NOT TO SUPPORT OPERATION BUT WAREHOUSE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER RAIL ASPECT AND ALSO OR WHOLESALERS SO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BE IN AND PACKED AT NEW PLAY BY IT BY THIS CHANGE. AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT SITES WHEN WE THINK OF IMPORT EXPORT WE ALWAYS FORGET THAT THEIR AIR CARGO COMING IN. LA X. S. THE NATION'S NUMBER TWO AIRPORTS -- THE SECOND BUSIEST AIRPORTS WITH THE EIGHTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION PASSENGERS COMING IN EVERY YEAR AND THEY WERE ALSO THE WORLD'S FOURTH BUSIEST AIRPORTS WE PROCESS OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS THROUGH LAX ALONE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND WITH THAT WE ALSO HAVE ALL THESE DIRECT FLIGHTS ARE LAUNCHING -- AS THE THE BECAUSE THE GENERAL MENTIONED BEFORE -- DRUG NONSTOP FLIGHTS -- TO WHAT THIS TIME SHOCK WHETHER IT'S SHALL DO -- LA LEADS THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THAT WERE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IT'S ESTIMATED THAT EACH DAILY NON STOP DIRECT FLIGHT COMING IN AND OUT OF LA ACTS. CREATES ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT TO THE LOCAL. COMMUNITY EVERY SINGLE YEAR THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO INCREASE THESE NUMBERS AND WHAT'S BEEN FASCINATING IS THAT'S GAIN. AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS WE SAW ABOUT CHINESE TAURUS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO A LOS ANGELES WITH THE FIRST CITY TO HAVE OVER ONE MILLION PASS AND VISITORS FROM CHINA -- TO LOS ANGELES AND IT'S BEEN GROWING SO LAST YEAR WE HAD A NEW NUMBER WITH ONE POINT TWO MIL IN CHINESE VISITORS. HELLO -- ACTUALLY JUST HIT A NEW RECORD THIS YEAR -- FIFTY MILLION VISITORS CAME TO LOS ANGELES AND WE LOVE OUR INTERNATIONAL VISITORS BECAUSE SPENT ABOUT TWENTY THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS LOCALLY. AND WITH THAT THEY ALSO CREE ABOUT TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF TAX REVENUE FOR THE LOCAL AND A COMMUNITY AS WELL. COMBINED TOGETHER YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMUNITY AND HOW THAT BRINGS EVERYBODY TOGETHER. AND WE ARE NOW WITNESSING SOME MAJOR -- ISSUES THAT ARE BEING FACED BY OUR LOCAL SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES. WITHIN GOVERNMENT XIN SOMEBODY SINCE ALL COMPANIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR SEEING THAT ALLOWED THE MARKET. THE COMPONENT PARTS FROM CHINA THEY WERE LOOKING ANOTHER LOCATION FOR MANUFACTURING US ALTERNATIVE SOME OF THEM ARE LOOKING TO MEXICO TO NEAR SHORE UNFORTUNATELY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WHEN THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE MIGHT BE ADDING A 5%. TAX A TARIFF ON MEXICO PRODUCT COMING IN IT BASICALLY ALSO CREDIT RISK FOR OUR COMPANIES TO MOVE FROM CHINA TO MEXICO NOW THEIR STOCK SO THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THAT'S REALLY CREATING SOME -- BACKLASH BECAUSE THESE COMPANIES ARE NOW HOLDING STILL AND THEY'RE NOT MOVING FORWARD WITH THEIR MANUFACTURING OR THEIR ORDERS WHICH IS GONNA LATER ON DOWN THE LINE IMPACT OUR TRADE LOGISTICS WAREHOUSE ON THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SECTORS -- LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THAT MORE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION BUT I WANTED TO PROVIDE THE PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO LOS ANGELES AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU JOHN. WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE MISTER JUST IN SCREENS A SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. AS WELL SENIOR ADVISER AND THE CLARITY. MCCARTY ASSOCIATES. MANAGER TING DISTINGUISHED GUESTS LADIES DIAMOND THANKS INVITATION I AM A NEW RESIDENTS OF THE GOLDEN STATE LESS THAN A YEAR I'VE BEEN ON THE GROUND HERE. IT'S REALLY AN AUTOMATIC PART OF HIS HEARING. OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM THRIVES ON DISCUSSION DEBATE TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS AND HAVING HEARING LIKE THIS. IMPORTANT TOPIC OF TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA SHOULD HELP US MOVE TOWARDS THE BEST POLICY SOLUTIONS IN THE WEEKS. MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO WORK IN AND OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN WASHINGTON DC AND IN CHINA. ON POLICY WITH ASIA MOST RECENTLY. TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN I SERVED AT THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN BEIJING AS THE MINISTER CONCERT FOR TRADE. I HOPE MY EXPERIENCE WORKING ON LINE UP AND ON COMMERCIAL UP SCHOOL CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE ISSUES AT HAND. COMMITTEES CONSIDER THE BEST WAY FORWARD. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ITS CITIZENS IS COMPANIES AND ITS FARMERS. THE VIEWS I EXPRESSED TODAY ON MY OWN AND DON'T REPRESENT THE POLICIES OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. UNITED TRADE REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION OR INSTITUTION AND JUST ONE PERSON ONE VOTE WHEN WE MOVED AHEAD WITH THE SECTION THREE OH WHAT. DECISION THE PERSON THAT GOT THE HONOR OF GOING TO THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE TO TELL THEM THAT WE WERE DOING THAT WITH ME -- I WAS WHAT YOU THREE AREAS THIS MORNING -- FIRST HOW WE ARRIVED AT THE STATE OF US CHINA TRADE TENSIONS. SECOND WEDDING CENTER THE MOMENT AND WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND THEN SOME FINAL THOUGHTS FOR WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE BUSINESSES AND UP THE CALIFORNIA. ENTERING THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY SEASON. I WANT TO BEGIN WITH QUOTES FROM TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. FROM AMERICAN HISTORY SPEAKING ABOUT THE PROMISE AND PERIL THE NATIONAL TRADE HERE'S THE FIRST. PIECE COMMERCE AN HONORS FRIENDSHIP WITH ALL NATIONS UNTANGLING ALLIANCES WITH NONE. AND HERE'S THE SECOND. SOONER OR LATER EVERY WORLD. BECOMES A WAR OF BLOOD. SO FOR OUR FOREBEARS THE CONDUCT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WAS OWNED UP WITH ISSUES OF ONE PIECE. WHAT'S THE STUFF. THE FIRST CALL WAS FOR SOMEONE WHO ONE ELECTORAL VICTORY IN AND WITH THE WHITE HOUSE OR FOR SECRETARY OF STATE THOMAS JEFFERSON. THE SECOND LABOR LEADER EUGENE DEBS LOST HIS BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY A CENTURY LATER. JEFF SAYS CONFLICTING VIEWS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF OUR PUBLIC. CONCERNS ABOUT THE CURRENT WAVE OF GLOBALIZATION AND CHINA'S TRADE PRACTICES DIDN'T START WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ALTHOUGH THE USE OF TARIFFS ISN'T A NOVEL. DURING MY RECENT TIME GOVERNMENT FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ADMINISTRATION BUT AN UNPRECEDENTED SIXTEEN CASES AGAINST CHINA AT THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. OR WTO AND PRODDED BEIJING TO ADDRESS THE OVER CAPACITY IN THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM SECTORS. THAT WERE UNDERMINING GLOBAL MARKETS. MAYBE SOME HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE MIGHT BE HELPFUL HERE ON CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL TRADE PRACTICES. AFTER OVER A DECADE OF NEGOTIATION WHEN THE U. S. ALWAYS OFTEN IN THE LEAD TRY TO JOIN THE WTO IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE MOST DETAILED SET OF REQUIREMENTS OF ANY NUMBER TO POINT AT THAT TIME. THE EXCEPTION PACKAGE IF YOU CAN REDUCE TARIFFS. FOR IMPORTS OPEN UP TRADING RIGHTS TO POP COMPANIES. AND REDUCE RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IN MANY PARTS OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY. WITH WTO MEMBERSHIP AND INCENTIVES FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT INTO CHINA AND OF COURSE THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE AND WORK FORCE THE CHINESE ECONOMY GREW FROM ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE TO NEARLY ELEVEN TRILLION IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACCORDING TO THE WORLD BANK PER CAPITA GDP WENT FROM AROUND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN 200-012-18000 DOLLARS LAST YEAR. BUT JUST ONE PERSONAL NOTE. AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN LIVING IN CHINA ON AND OFF FOR TWENTY YEARS WHEN I FIRST LIVED IN CHINA IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. THE MOST PRIZED COMMODITY COFFEE BEANS BY FAR. WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD. AND WHEN I LEFT BEIJING LAST YEAR I WOULD SAY OUTSIDE THE US EMBASSY GATE ONE BLOCK AWAY THERE WERE FOR STARBUCKS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE -- AND FEAR NOT FOR THOSE OF YOU HANKER FOR A BAY AREA LOTS A IN CHINA TWENTY SEVENTEEN PETE'S OPENED UP A FLAGSHIP BRANCH IN SHANGHAI. ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE I'VE BEEN. RETURNING TO OUR WTO STORY THE CURRENT UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE USTR LASSITER PUBLIC HEISER. HAS PUBLICLY FOR AS FAR BACK AS TWENTY TWO AND THE VIEW THAT W. TWO MEMBERS SHOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED CHINA IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE AT THE MOST MACRO LEVEL HIS CRITICISM. THAT BY DROPPING STATE RESOURCES AND LIMITING THE ACTS OF FOREIGN FIRMS GOODS AND SERVICES. TO THE DOMESTIC MARKET THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP IS UNFAIRLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AN OPEN GLOBAL ECONOMY WHILE READING THIS TIME AT HOME. AND IN SPECIFIC SECTORS EVEN WHEN THE U. S. HAS PREVAILED IN WTO LITIGATION. AB IN THE MARKET OFTEN HAS REMAINED CLOSE TO PART COMPANY FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN TWO CASES THAT THE U. S. ONE YEARS AGO WHEN SECTORS IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA. ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS WHICH IS HE IS A MASTER CARD AMERICAN EXPRESS AND FILMS. ACTUALLY GETTING LICENSES TO OPERATE BASED ON WTO RULES AFTER W. RULING HAS PROVEN DEVILISHLY DIFFICULT. I ALSO HAD DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS FOR THE LACK OF LIBERALIZATION THE CHINESE ECONOMY OVER A DECADE. FROM IS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS TO THE RISE OF PRESIDENT XI JINPING. BUT THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US COMPANIES FEEL INCREASINGLY LESS WELCOME IN CHINA. WE NOW WITH US CHINA TRADE FRICTION LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DID A GREAT JOB OF OF SETTING THE GROUND WORK SO I WON'T COVER THAT AGAIN HERE. I WOULD JUST SAY AB AND IN PARALLEL TO INCREASING TRADE ON BOTH SIDES IT CAN CHRISTIAN TERRACE EXCUSE ME ON BOTH SIDES. AND INTERTWINED WITH THIS NARRATIVE OF THE TO PROTECT TERRACE. IS A PORTAL DE COUPLING OF THE U. S. AND CHINESE TECHNOLOGY MARKETS WITH SOME OF TERM IN NEW TECH COLD WAR. AND THERE'S A COTTAGE INDUSTRY IN WASHINGTON THESE DAYS YOU CAN COME UP WITH WHAT THE RIGHT PHRASE SHOULD BE OF US CHINA TRADE FRICTION. YOU'LL GET FAMOUS -- COOL WARS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BUT A SERIES OF CHINESE POLICIES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE PROMOTED DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT. TO THE DETRIMENT OF US PRODUCERS FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CHINESE BANKING REGULATOR EACH ISSUED NEW RULES PHASING OUT FOREIGN HARDWARE IN MOST NETWORK AND IT APPLICATIONS. IN APRIL TWENTY FOURTEEN JUMPING ON HELPFULLY PUSHED A NATIONALISTIC CYBERSECURITY POSTURE AND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE MADE IN CHINA TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MANIFESTOS EXPLICIT DOMESTIC MARKET GOALS. IN TEN HIGH TECH SECTORS FROM TRICK VEHICLES TO CLOUD COMPUTING. FOR ITS PART UNITED STATES AS THE TO READING CHINESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES CT AND HARD. ON THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S CITIES LET LIMITING THEIR ACCESS TO US COMPANIES FINANCING. ZZ WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME OPERATIONS WILL ALWAYS FATE REMAINS UNCERTAIN. ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE IN MARCH THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT LED COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THAT IT STATES WERE SERVICE. TOLL CHINESE GAMING COMPANY QUINLAN TO UNWIND ITS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ACQUISITION OF THE GAY DATING UP THERE AND APRIL SURFACE BLOCK MY KNEES ACQUISITION. THE U. S. HEALTHCARE PORTAL PATIENTS LIKE ME. BOTH OF THESE DECISIONS WERE OFFICIALLY TAKEN. ACT U. S. NATIONAL SECURITY. REQUIRED BY THE RELEVANT STATUTE WHICH IS KNOWN AS FROM. ON THE TRADE TALKS WHERE THEY SAID NOW. THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP AS A NUMBER OF YEARS OF SAID WOULD BE FOR RESULT IN A FACE TO FACE TALKS MY GUESS IS BEIJING WOULD BE THE NEXT. CITY I'VE BEEN AT THE PLACE OF THE HOSTED -- PROBABLY THE BEGINNING POINT WILL BE V. HUNDRED FIFTY PAGE DRAFT THAT THE TWO SIDES ARE WORKING ON WHICH WOULD ADDRESS US MARKET ACCESS CONCERNS. INCLUDE A BASKET OF PURCHASES AND CHIP AWAY AT SOME CHINESE INDUSTRIAL POLICY CONCERNS IN EXCHANGE THE TWO SIDES. OF TERRACE ON EACH OTHER'S GOODS THAT WOULD PRESUMABLY GRANT SOME SORT OF LIFE FLIGHT TOOK AWAY THAT SAID. WHATEVER AGREEMENT IS OR IS NOT REACH BETWEEN THE US AND CHINESE GOVERNMENTS IN THE COMING WEEKS OR MONTHS. BY TRADE AND DIPLOMATIC FRICTION IS HERE TO STAY AS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SAID THIS IS NOT SIMPLY A PHENOMENON OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL GO AWAY IN TWO OR SIX YEARS. IN WASHINGTON VIEW OF CHINA AMONG THE POLITICAL CLASS. BUSINESS LEADERS MILITARY STRATEGISTS AND IN MANY PARTS OF THE US GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY HAS SHIFTED. FROM THAT OF A DEVELOPING COUNTRY NEEDING TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THE GLOBAL ORDER TO A PREDATORY STATE BACK ON UP UP ENDING US LEADERSHIP. FROM FIVE G. STANDARDS TO NAVIGATION IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. FROM EXPORTING A MODEL OF A BETTER TERM CAPITALISM TO THE ONGOING CRACKDOWN IN XINJIANG UYGUR AUTONOMOUS REGION JING'S AMBITIOUS AMBITIONS AND METHODS. ARE SEEN AS CONFLICTING WITH LONG STANDING US GOALS IN THE REGION ACROSS THE GLOBE. SO. LEAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A CASUAL OBSERVER WORKING. THE US GOVERNMENT ON AND OFF FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES IN CHINA I WOULD SAY THAT CALIFORNIA BRAND IN CHINA AS THE STRONGEST OF ANY STATE THAT I'VE SEEN. I THINK IT ALSO HELPS THAT IN CHINESE YOU HAVE A VERY SIMPLE WORD FOR CALIFORNIA SOME STATES MY HOME STATE OF NEW JERSEY FOR EXAMPLE EXTREMELY LONG NUMBER OF CHINESE CHARACTERS. IN THE IN CHINESE CALIFORNIA JOE JOE'S JUST MUCH SIMPLER TO SAVE AND SOME OTHER STATES -- I'VE SEEN YOUR GOVERNOR'S TRIP WITH HEAD OF STATE LIKE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE DURING VISITS YOUR UNIVERSITIES ARE SOUGHT AFTER. BY THE BRIGHTEST MINDS YOUR PROPERTY MARKETS OUR FAVORITE DESTINATIONS FOR AND SPENT YOUR TECHNOLOGIES COVETED. INNOVATION SYSTEM IS CLOSELY STUDY AND YOUR CULTURAL IMPACT IS INDEED A FEW THOUGHTS CONCLUDE. FIRST. CALIFORNIA COMPANIES AND ENTREPRENEURS NEED TO BE ALIVE TO THE OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA. BOTH IN TERMS OF SELLING ITS MARKET AND ATTRACTING CHINESE COUPLE HERE. BUT IT WOULD BEHOOVE BUSINESSES THE GOLDEN STATE. TO BE MINDFUL OF THE RISING REGULATORY STRUCTURE IN WASHINGTON DC EXAMINING INBOUND IS INVESTMENT AND MONITORING UP ON EXPORTS TO CHINA. THE US GOVERNMENT IS AT THE MOMENT LOOKING AT TEN AREAS OF WORK EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR ADDED SCRUTINY AND COMPANIES OPERATING IN THOSE AREAS NEED TO MOVE WITHOUT A CAUTION. THOSE ARE IN THE AREA OF EXPORT CONTROLS SECOND. CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY AND REPRESENTED TO SPEAK UP IN WASHINGTON AND ACROSS THE US THE LEGISLATIVE AND WILL MAKING PROCESS REQUIRES PUBLIC INPUT AT ANY DIFFERENT STAGES. BEING PART OF THE CONVERSATION WILL HELP INSURE CALIFORNIA'S INTERESTS AND OUR BEST PROTECTED SO SUBMIT TESTIMONY APPEAR PUBLIC HEARINGS MAKE YOUR COLLECTIVE VOICE HEARD. UC BERKELEY CHAPTER CALLED GHOSTS LETTER IN FEBRUARY ELEGANTLY UP HELD THE VALUES OF ACADEMIC OPEN. AND ONE AGAINST DEMONIZING AMERICANS OTHER CALIFORNIANS TO SHE COULD DO THE SAME. THIRDS PICKUP IN AN AS WELL THAT IS FOR MARKET ACCESS CONCERNS OF YOUR COMPANIES DO NOT SELL CENTER A NUMBER OF FOLKS HAVE MENTIONED THAT CHINA HAS FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH AUSTRALIA AND CHILE AND CHILEAN WINE GETS ENTER INTO THE FREE. WELL CHINA COULD ENTERED COULD CHANGE THE TIRE OF THAT HAS ON ON U. S. ONE FOR EXAMPLE AND DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT. SO TO SPEAK UP FOR RESTRICTIONS FOR TRYING FOR CALIFORNIA EXPORTS OF SERVICES AND AT TRADE FRICTION AND BROKE YOUR BROADER GEOSTRATEGIC POSITIONING SHOULD NOT LIMIT NORMAL COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION OR EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES. CIVIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE AND CAN YOU TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CALIFORNIA ENGAGE WITH CHINA AND WITH THE PACIFIC. AMERICA IS A SPECIFIC MISSION AND THESE TIES WILL CONTINUE TO BEAR FRUIT FOR OUR COMPANIES ARE UNIVERSITIES. PEOPLE FOR DECADES TO COME WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU MISTER GREEN BUT WE'RE VERY.

KIND OF DANCED AROUND A LITTLE BIT. AND I MENTIONED IT IS BUT IT IS VERY. REAL PART OF THIS EQUATION WHICH IS THAT FOR A LONG TIME NOW CALIFORNIA COMPANIES AND COMPANIES. HAVE BEEN COMPLETE MEANING ABOUT THE STRENGTHS THAT THEY HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA AND I'M I UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. RECIPROCITY IS SOMETHING THAT THE CHINESE AND CHINESE CULTURE IS VERY MUCH VALUED. OUR SYSTEM IS VERY OPEN TO CHINESE INVESTMENT. OUR COMPANIES AS THEY ENDEAVOR TO DO BUSINESS CHINA -- HAVE FACE VERY SERIOUS CONSTRAINTS SENT OUT I KNOW DEPUTY CONSUL GENERAL SAID THERE VOLUNTARILY THERE YES THEY ARE VOLUNTARILY THERE BUT THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS VOLUNTARILY AT LEAST WHAT I WOULD CALL VOLUNTARILY. ABSENT NEEDING TO THE CONSTRAINTS SO -- US COMPANIES CAN AFFORD TO COMPANIES GOD I WILL TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS OFTEN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS NOT NECESSARILY INTERESTED IN PUBLICIZING THEIR COMPLAINTS ABOUT SOME OF THAT -- SOME OF THE THE BARRIERS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO DO IF THEY WANT TO OPERATE IN CHINA. I'M BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO ROCK THE BOAT THEY WANT TO TRY TO WORK IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES WELL I THINK IT'S REACHED A HEAD AND I THINK THAT AS A CHINA IT REALLY. HAS NOT JUST YOU KNOW HAD THIS ARC OF MATURITY IN THERE ARE INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALINGS BUT NOW ARE A FULL FULL HEDGED OBVIOUSLY MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL. A COMMUNITY THAT RECOGNIZING ON THAT. THAT NEGOTIATING ROUNDS SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT US COMPANIES HAVE COUNTERED IS SOMETHING THAT WILL. ULTIMATELY LEAD US TO A FRIENDLY RESOLUTION AT THIS CURRENT CONFLICT AND I HOPE. THAT BECAUSE OF NATURE I LIVE CALIFORNIA AND AT THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TRULY THIS SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP I BELIEVE. I BETWEEN EUROPE THIS SUB NATIONAL LEVEL AT WHICH PROFESSOR GREEN ALLUDED TO YOU KNOW. THAT OUR PERCEPTION OUR OUR CULTURE AT OPENNESS AS A SOCIETY. OUR ATTRACTIVE YES STUDENTS FROM CHINA WHICH WE HAVE A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE. HEIDI'S NATIONALS CURRENTLY OR IN OUR UC SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE AND MEETING WHICH ACTUALLY THE UC REGENTS IS MEETING I ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET GOING OVER THERE SOON -- BUT I HOPE THAT AS PART OF THAT PART OF THAT CONVERSATION WHICH REALLY IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR PIECE. OF MOVING THIS ALONG. AND GETTING BACK TO LOWERING AT THE TERRORISTS ON BOTH SIDES I HOPE THAT. CALIFORNIA COMPANIES AND INTERLOCUTORS WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT IF I TO SEAT AT THE TABLE ON THE FEDERAL SIDE AT LEAST. UNSEAT SOMEWHERE AT A CHAIR IN THE ROOM TO BE ABLE TO HELP THAT PART OF THE PROCESS ALONG. THANK YOU LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ALSO THANKS SO MUCH SPENDING SO MUCH TIME WITH US TODAY. SO SO IT SOUNDS LIKE PARTICULAR NOT ONLY DO WE HER. LOWER THE TERRORIST WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GOING. ON BOTH SIDES TO DOING BUSINESS. CALIFORNIA AND YOU IT'S DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF BARRIERS ENTRY FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. I'M THAT IS A KEY PROVISION OF YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY OF US TRADE WE WELCOME FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND WE OFFER A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. TO FOREIGN COMPANIES ALONG WITH US COMPANIES HERE I IT'S WHY WE ARE SO ATTRACTIVE ONE OF THE REASONS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY THE UNITED STATES IS IT ATTRACTIVE TO FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. SO MY HOPE IS THAT. THIS SAYS WILL BE SEEN AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHINA. TO RECOGNIZE THAT OPENING UP EVEN MORE I'M IS SOMETHING THAT ULTIMATELY WILL BE CAUGHT I FOR THE NINETIES ECONOMY AND FRANKLY. I'M WILL LET AGAIN AS THE CONSUL GENERAL MENTION DEVELOP THESE TRADE RELATIONSHIPS WHICH ULTIMATELY. AS FORM AND BASIS OF COOPERATION COLLABORATION FRIENDSHIP AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING I WHICH WILL BE TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR GENERATION AND FUTURE GENERATIONS AS WELL [INAUDIBLE] THEY SO -- TO CHOP YOU YOU HIGHLIGHTED. THERE ARE IN LOS ANGELES A LOT OF THE ISSUES AROUND -- MANUFACTURING OUR HOUSE DISTRIBUTION. MAYBE YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE. MORE ABOUT ONE SUCH MORE SPECIFIC IMPACTS BUT ALL OF REALLY WHAT WILL BE COULD BE IN BECAUSE THE THOSE ARE. WORKING CLASS JOBS THAT WE COULD EASILY BE THE LOSER. SO -- I ACTUALLY WANTED TO GET BACK OF WHAT THE LEAGUE HAD GOVERNOR WAS SAYING THIS WELL -- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MANUFACTURING ONE OF THE KEY SECTORS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GROW IN LOS ANGELES IS A CLEAN TECHNOLOGY SECTOR -- GIVEN THAT LOS ANGELES IN CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IN THE WORLD WE DON'T SHY AWAY FROM WE STEP UP WHEN THE PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY FROM THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENTS. THE CALIFORNIA AND THE LOS ANGELES REGION. BASICALLY SAID WE'RE GONNA DOCTOR ARE OF THAT THE PAST KIND OF GREEN ON THEIR OWN ACCORD AND WITH THAT WE ACTUALLY DO NOT STOP TO TALK WEEK CREATED PROGRAMS WE CAN ACTUALLY -- AT HERE TO THESE RELATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION INCLUDING LOS ANGELES CITIES OWN CLEAN -- GREEN NEW DEAL AS WELL A SOMETHING CALLED THE CLEANER ACTION PLAN THAT PORTABLE SENDS AS PART OF LONG BEACH WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE REDUCING BY MENTAL -- POLLUTION WHILE INCREASING POOR ACTIVITIES. AND THESE ARE. BACKED BY A FUNDING -- BOTH FROM THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE CAR MY LOOK MORE PROGRAMS AND OTHER GRANTS AS WELL. NOW WE'RE CREATING BRANIEWO TECHNO G. AND INCLUDING SHORTS I PLUG IN TECHNOLOGY -- ELECTRIFICATION OF THE PORTS -- ELECTRIC HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS THAT ARE ABLE TO MOVE -- OUR CARGO TO AND FROM LOS ANGELES REGION. WHAT BETTER WAY? AREA OR COUNTRY TO EXPORT OUR PRODUCTS AND TO CHINA AND WE'RE REALLY EAGER TO DO SO HOWEVER WITH SUCH AN ALLERGY WHETHER IT'S REAL OR WHETHER IT'S BURNED -- OR JUST SPECULATED A LOT OF OUR COMPANIES ARE VERY WARY ABOUT GOING INTO CHINA. WHICH FOR US AS THE ONE THAT ONE ROAD STRATEGIES MOVING FORD IS GOING CONNECTS SO MANY DIFFERENT MARKETS SO HAVING A PARTNER AND CHINA TO BE ABLE TO HELP US GET ACCESS. AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE COMPANIES WHETHER YOU'RE A MULTI NATIONAL CONGLOMERATE OR SMALL. AND MEDIUM SIZE FROM LOS ANGELES YOU HAVE EQUAL ACCESS EQUAL FOOTING WILL BE VERY VERY HELPFUL AND I KNOW THAT CHINA'S ARTI MOVING FORWARD WITH CHANGING SOME OF THE POLICIES IN TERMS OF AND IP PROTECTION. AND THAT WHAT WILL BE GREAT ALSO IS TO LOOK AT ENFORCEMENT SIDE AS WELL AND ALSO THE COMMUNICATION BACK TO OUR REGION SO WE UNDERSTAND CLEARLY HOW TO ACCESS THAT MARKET. AND THIS IS AGAIN TIED BACK INTO MANUFACTURING BECAUSE WE ARE NOW WILL BE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PROGRAMS LIKE THE CLEAN ASIDE THE LOSS I JUST THINK I CAN GET BETTER -- WE'RE PUTTING CITY RESOURCES AND AND REGIONAL RESPONSES INTO IT AND ONCE THESE COMPANIES ARE READY TO GO WERE REALLY BEING THAT CHINA WILL BE ONE OF THE MAJOR PARKS. GREAT THANK YOU. I MISSED YOU YOU YOU MENTIONED -- OF THE INTEREST OF CHINA COMPANIES COMING TO SAVE IT BUT ALSO TO THE BAY AREA THERE BEEN IMPACTS SINCE THE WAR ON ALL OF THAT INTEREST IF YOU SEEN ANY KIND OF DAMPENING OF OF THANK YOU SO. MUCH ASSEMBLYMAN TING FOR THE QUESTION IS A REALLY QUESTION AND TO BE QUITE HONEST -- I HAVE NOT SEEN OF A WALL IN AND DAY I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT LESS BUT I'D WITH CALLED TIRE KICKERS COMING THROUGH A TOWN NOW. STIRS CONTINUED A COMMA AND WHEN WE DO SPEAK TO INVESTORS. THEY ACTUALLY DO HAVE THE MONEY AND THEY'RE READY TO GO -- AND THEY'RE NOT AFRAID -- TO PIGGY BACK ALSO AND ON WHAT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SAID IN WHAT STEVEN SAID I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT -- EDUCATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR INBOUND INVESTORS -- AND ONE ONE TOPIC THAT IS OF MAJOR CONCERN AND I'M SURE. THE PROFESSOR COULD ALSO CONFIRM AS FIFTY AS HAS BEEN THE BIG ISSUE ESPECIALLY FOR AN INBOUND INVESTMENT WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO EMMA NAY WHETHER CAN HE FOR TECH COMPANY. OR EVEN MANUFACTURING OR EVEN REAL ESTATE -- BUT THE THING IS THAT WHAT WE STILL HAVE LEARNED IS THAT FOR MY EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN LESS THAN ONE OUT OF TEN COMPANIES ACTUALLY BEING STOPPED -- BECAUSE OF THE PS RULES -- WHEREAS YOU KNOW IF THESE COMPANIES WHO ARE LOOKING TO INVEST IN THE US IF THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEING EDUCATED OR THEY TALK TO MORE PEOPLE COMMUNICATION IS KEY. THE MORE THEY LEARN THE MORE PEOPLE THEY TALK TO THEY WILL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND AGAIN CALIFORNIA IS DEFINITELY OPEN FOR BUSINESS I TELL EVERYONE WE'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST OPEN STATES IN THE IN THE NATION -- BUT THE THING IS ONCE ONCE THESE FOREIGN COMPANIES UNDERSTAND THAT FIFTY IS IS AN ISSUE YOU SHOULD DECLARE. AND ACTUALLY A TEACH THEM HOW TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS IT WILL MAKE -- I THINK IN DOWN INVESTORS FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WHEN THEY'RE COMING TO YOU WITH GREAT THANK YOU -- IT IN. FOR YOU YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- REALLY THE IMPORTANCE IN CALIFORNIA IN CHINA. WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING IN TERMS OF -- RIDLEY ARE WITHIN THIS GREAT WAR. HOW WE AT THE STATE SHOULD BE ACTING -- I AGREE WITH THANK YOU -- PHILIP NOW AND I AGREE WITH THREATEN GUN AND I AND OTHERS SPEAKERS DODD TO COMMUNICATION THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT ON THE RIGHT TO OUR VOICE. BE HEARD AND CALIFORNIA FRIENDS WISE BE HEARD BY BOWS WASHINGTON AND BEIJING. YEAH -- INCLUDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL OF YOU THAT'S THE MEANT WE KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT PERFECT. CHINA -- A FEW DAYS AGO I MEANT TO THE CELL PRESIDENTE CABLES ALL OF SHANGHAI -- ABOUT CHAMBER THEY ALSO RAISES THE THEY USED TO ALL FOR MASTERCARD -- THE VISA CARD AND OPEN A SOUL FOUGHT CHINA AS FINANCIAL MARKET -- ON THE MOVIE. CONSULATE GENERAL HERE IS ALSO A CHANNEL WE WILL REPORT TO AND SO. DIFFERENT CHINA -- TO WASHINGTON TO BEIJING MORE COMMUNICATION A LADY AT HAVE A BETTER HONEST NATURE. AS MENTIONED THE BY -- MY COLLEAGUES TO ME. GREEN AS CLOSE TOGETHER IN BEIJING. BY THAT TIME THE STRATEGIC ON THE MAP ECONOMIC A DIALOGUE. IT'S A VERY GOOD SO MÙT COMMUNICATION -- WITH EACH OTHER AND DIALOGUE. LEGAL. FOURTEEN GREAT THANK YOU. THE MYSTERY YOU DUE TO THE LITTLE ABOUT. WE COULD. BE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS CALL SIR AND ABOUT IF THIS -- DOESN'T RESOLVED ANYTIME SOON. THANK YOU AGAIN WHAT WHAT IT WAS. WE KNOW WHAT'S WHAT ARE THE STAKES FOR CALIFORNIA. IS A MEMBER TING THANKS AGAIN VERY MUCH AND I JUST WANNA SAY AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN A DIPLOMAT ONSTAGE HAVING HIS. CHINESE THANK YOU A DIFFICULT STRUGGLE RUN IT'S IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO DO -- TO IT REPRESENT YOUR COUNTRY IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE SO THANKS FOR DOING THIS IN ENGLISH -- MAYBE I COULD HAVE A YEAR AGO -- I THINK THE THE BROADER CHALLENGE IT OFF ON THE CURRENT TRADE FRICTIONS THAT IT. MORPHED INTO SOMETHING MUCH LARGER THAT IT. WITH THE F. B. I. EMPOWERED TO GO AFTER WHAT THEY SEE AS THEFT OF US INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR AFTER CHINESE AMERICANS I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST -- KIND OF BROADER TRUMPS THE UNITED STATES IN US SOCIETY. I THINK ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE. IN THIS CURTAILING OF INVESTMENT ACROSS BOTH -- BUT ACROSS THE PACIFIC IS IS GOING TO BE WHAT FARMS -- IN SOME WAYS MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN TERRACE AND I THINK THEY'RE OTHER ODDS OF HIS CONCERNS AND I THINK THE US NEEDS TO BE ALERT TO THEM AS I SAID. BUT I THINK THE ONCE INVESTMENT PATTERNS REALLY CHANGE OVER YEAR SOME PEOPLE THINK WELL I DON'T KNOW ONE INVEST IN CALIFORNIA -- EITHER ONE OF US THE UNITED STATES I'M GONNA GO TO NEW ZEALAND OR AUSTRALIA THEN I THINK ONCE THAT MIND SETS WHICH IS THAT THAT'S THAT'S QUITE DANGEROUS. YEAH THE END AND AS YOU HAD MENTIONED BEFORE. THE WHOLE THING ABOUT. WHEN IS? AND IN CHINA THAT IS STRONG NOT ONLY IS CALIFORNIA'S BRIGHT TRONG. THE BRAND OF OUR CITIES FRANCISCO CHANGED. THOSE ARE ALL SEEN AS DESTINATION PLACES FOR INVESTMENT. IN A YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ONLY CAN THINK AGAIN THE COUNTRIES WERE COMPETING AGAINST OTHER STATES TO SOMETHING THAT IS. ALSO A CHALLENGE THAT WE ALL FACE THAT IT ARE. STATE A FAR. THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER PEOPLE WILL TURN. STEPPED IN TO THAT. I KNOW THAT THAT WAS MY OPEN TO ONE OF THE PUBLIC TO KIND OF HAPPEN OPINIONS OR ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC WE HAVE A MICROPHONE. ANYBODY WANTS. TO SAVE. WE HAVE OUR OUR CAT WOMAN FROM MILLBRAE WAY MUCH INTRODUCE YOURSELF. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS -- MERRILL WAYNE FROM THIS CITY NO BREAK. WE ARE AS A CAT. LOOKING INTO FORMING A TRADE OFFICE -- FOR REPORTERS WITHOUT THE CONSULTATION WITH A LESSER THANK YOU TONY. AND SO TURN CAN MAYBE WE CAN TAKE TURNS AWAY BUT WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES. TAX BREAKS. AND OTHER TYPE OF THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO HELP CHINESE ARE GOOD SIR OUR BUSINESS IS. TO PERFORM IN CALIFORNIA -- ONE THING ABOUT THE BAY AREA MOSTLY IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM LOS ANGELES AT WIMBERLEY SERVICE BASED. SO I'M WONDERING HOW THAT AFFECTS. OUR SERVICE BASED ECONOMY IN CHINA AND AROUND THE WORLD. THERE'S A SHIFTED TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THIS ISSUE AND AND AND WHY HEARD WAS ALARMING IS THAT. SOME COMPANIES TO STOP PRODUCING. PRODUCTS THAT ALSO INCLUDES SERVICES THANK YOU. GREAT ANYBODY WANNA. JUMP IN I COULD TRY TO TAKE A STAB AT THE TERROR OF QUICK IN -- AND I THINK IT'S FOR IT IF I COULD HAVE A KIND OF TERROR FREE ZONE. ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF THE WTO WHICH THE UNITED STATES SET UP AFTER WORLD WAR TWO FIRST IN THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE GATT AND THE WTO WAS. THIS IDEA THAT COUNTRIES SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE ON TERRORISTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THERE SHOULD BE MOST FAVORED NATION WHICH JUST MEANS A NORMAL HER FLAVEL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE SECTION THREE ONE TERRACE DO THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS ON IS AGAINST THE RULES OF THE WTO AND SO THOSE WTO RULES PROHIBIT CHINA SAYING. CALIFORNIA ALMONDS WILL HAVE ZERO TARIFF PERCENTAGE FOR YOU BUT ALMONDS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT HIGH UNLESS THERE'S AN EXCEPTION FOR A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT SO THAT'S WHY CHILEAN WINE. AND AUSTRALIAN LIKE IT'S COME INTO THE FREEZER SENATE'S HIGHER FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. SO UNLESS THE US AND CHINA HAD A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WE COULDN'T KIND OF BRING THE STARS DOWN. TO ZERO I THINK THE THE OF THE OTHER AREA THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT IS ON INVESTMENT THAT IS OFTEN TIMES A TRADE INVESTMENT KIND OF GO HAND IN HAND YOU HAVE A PROCESSING FACILITY THAT'S PROCESSING ALMONDS. AND IF YOU INVEST IN THAT THAT HELPS THE SALE OF IT AND SO. ARE. ABOUT CHANGING RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENT I THINK SOME OF THE CHINESE I COULD LOOK AT AND ON OUR SIDE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENT SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING MAYBE MORE SYMBOLIC ON THE CALIFORNIA SOUGHT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT ALL. ON INVESTMENT ZONES. RIGHT OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS THE AUDIENCE HELLO. THANKS EVERYONE. MATCHING I RESEARCH CHINA CALIFORNIA RELIGIONS THE QUESTION FOR LIEUTENANT THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY ON THE KEY ROLE OF THE STATE BERMAN AT WITH TECHNOLOGY RELATIONS. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HIM SO VALUABLE THE COMPANIES ARE RELIEVED NATIONAL AND GLOBAL COMPANIES AND SO THEIR RELATIONS WITH CHINA OFTEN ESCALATE VERY MUCH TO THE NATIONAL LEVEL OR THE KIND OF RUNNING THEIR OWN DIPLOMACY SOMETIMES. I'M WONDERING WHETHER YOU THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN HELPING NEGOTIATOR OR WORK OUT THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANIES GOOGLE FACEBOOK WHATNOT AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND CHINESE MARKET ACCESS AND RESTRICTIONS. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- I'VE BEEN IN MY JOB FOR SIX MONTHS WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR NEWSOME MOVES MAYOR. OF SAN FRANCISCO WHO HAS VERY CLOSE -- RELATIONSHIPS WITH THAT TECH COMPANIES MANY OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE CITY THAT HE WAS MAYOR -- BUT ALSO HE WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF AT TECHNOLOGY ON THE PUBLIC SQUARE DEMOCRACY TRYING TO READ WAS CALLED -- SOMETHING MARKETS GERMAN ANYWAY OUT BUT IT IS BY THE CITIZENS OF CITIZEN DAHLE THANK YOU. I'M AND SO I THE REASON THAT I'M SITTING HERE IN THIS CAPACITY IS THAT HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DESIGNATING ME HE REPRESENTATIVE FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. WE'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE HE ALSO ESTABLISH AN INTER AGENCY COMMITTEE WE USED TO HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HE WAS ELIMINATED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR KIND OF A LONG STORY. BUT THE WORK HAS NOT GONE AWAY AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT REGION'S LIKE LOS ANGELES I MEAN. NO THIS PRESENTATION TODAY I THINK CLEARLY EXEMPLIFIES THE THE ENGAGEMENT OF LA IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT I'M SAN DIEGO HAS SIMILAR INFRASTRUCTURE BAY AREA BERRY COUNSELED DURING THESE GROUP. HERE AS WELL -- THERE'S A LOT OF THIS REGIONAL ACTIVITY THAT'S KIND OF TAKEN THE PLACE OF THE STATE ROLL. I'M. BUT THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT STATE TILT CELL DOES I WILL TELL YOU A LOT OF IT. IS HAS BEEN NOW OVER THE LAST DECADE PLUS AROUND THE CLIMATE AGENDA. I'M AT THE SUB NATIONAL LEVEL THE STATE HAS A LOT MORE MORE ROOM TO ROAM MANEUVER AND SAT POLICY -- AS WELL AS DO MISSIONAL EXCHANGES AND I THAT KIND OF WORK. I'M SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REALLY ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED WITH FULL RESPECT OF THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS JURISDICTION HERE ON THINGS LIKE SETTING TERRACE. I'M AND THEN OF COURSE RAISING OUR VOICES. THANK HEY WE AGREE BROUGH WE AGREE WE NEED ACTION -- IN RESPONSE TO THE FREE A ONE DECISIONS I AND WE WANT TO BE PART OF THAT. CONVERSATION. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE WAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS GONE ABOUT THIS IS THEY'VE CREATED THE PRESSURE BY -- BY PUTTING THE TERRORISTS IN PLACE. BUT WE ARE OVER A YEAR INTO THIS AND THERE HASN'T BEEN. ANY MEANINGFUL AND AT LEAST ANY REPORTED MEANINGFUL I ADVANCES IN THIS CONVERSATION NOW AGAIN WE HEAR ANECDOTALLY THERE ARE MEETINGS THAT ARE GOING ON EVEN THIS WEEK. TO TRY TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD BY -- TWO IN THE MEANTIME. IT'S IT'S AFFECTING US IN A VERY SERIOUS WAY IN NOT. YOU KNOW AND SPECIFICALLY IN TECHNOLOGY IS ALL. SO WE'RE WORKING ON IT. GET YOU GET QUESTIONS OVER HERE HI. AND THAT FROM A DIXIE BUT AND I'M CO CHAIR OF A GLOBAL. YEAH WE HAVE HER DAY SOME OF THE BETWEEN THE US AND CHINA FROM A NATIONAL LEVEL. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY AS WE GO FARTHER DOWN AND HAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING GAUGED -- AND THEN CITY TO CITY INVOLVEMENT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE PEOPLE TO PEOPLE ENGAGEMENTS ARE WE CAN'T FORGET THAT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT HOW YOU KNOW WHERE WE SEE -- SOME OF THE GREATEST GAINS IN TERMS OF OPENING DOORS IS WHEN STUDENTS COME AND STUDY. FROM CHINA INTO THE US AND U. S. STUDENTS GO TO STUDY -- IN CHINA I THINK THAT'S THE YOU KNOW THE DIALOGUE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TOURISM HAS TO CONTINUE SO I THINK WE NEED TO BUILD THE BONDS OF THE PEOPLE TO PEOPLE. AND THE YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF AND FRANKLY I FEEL THAT THE ECONOMIC LARGER YOU KNOW BY NATIONALLY EIGHT INCH TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES SO I THINK IF WE FOCUS ON PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT IN THE END [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [INAUDIBLE] TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER TANK. AND AND THE CHILDREN HEY TO ALL. PARTICIPATE THIS. ONE MY NAME'S HIM MADE HIM. A WAS SO. CAN COMMISSIONER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. DURING THE YEAR. TO TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY THIRTEEN APPOINTED BY PULLED GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER THE GOVERNOR BROWN [INAUDIBLE] AND HI AM I BEING HEAVILY INVOLVED. IN THE CAN NO CHINA TRAINING SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE MAKE ABOUT OVER ONE HUNDRED TRIPS TO CHINA DURING THIS. LAST FOUR YEARS. ALL WELL REALIZE THAT WHEN YOU THIS SOLUTION -- TO SOLVE THIS. AND THE ARE LIKE. TO REQUEST A EXTRA OVER HERE. THERE MAY BE ALL THE ALTERNATE. IN ADDITION TO OF COURSE GIVEN THE PRESSURE. TO COME UP TO YOU A WERE PRESSED ON TO US YES OFFICE OR SCHOOL TO LAW. WHO OF COURSE THIS ASSUMES POSSIBLE [INAUDIBLE] SO MY SUGGESTION A PROPOSAL WILL BE BASED ON ANOTHER SIMILAR. CASE BACK TO THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE ON DECEMBER NINTH -- I WAS INVITED BY. STATE ASSEMBLY TO GIVE THE PUBLIC SPEAKING. LIKE THIS ONE AT THAT TIME THE CASE WAS WAS MUCH SMALLER SCALE. IT WAS IN THE SOLAR PANEL -- DISPUTE BACK TO THAT TIME. CAN FOUR S.. THAT'S ALL ASKING 43522100%. OF X. LARA IMPORT DO ONTO THE SOLAR RELATED PRODUCTS. SO BACK TO THAT TIME WAS VERY BIG IMPACT. CLEAN THE GREEN STREET SO -- IN THE PUBLIC HEARING. THAT I GAVE A FEW NUMBERS. AND THIS CAN BE A GOOD EXAMPLE HOW WE CAN POSSIBLY. WORK OUT ALL THE CURRENT HAVE TO TO TO TO CHOI ASIAN. SO BY THAT TIME I DO FEEL WHICH TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY IN A PUBLIC HEARING. THAT'S WHY EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR. WE SPENT ON THE SOLAR PANEL THAT TIME. ONLY 6% WAS ON BOTH MATERIALS. SOLAR CELL AND MODULES. THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN. PERCENT OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT BY OUR TAXPAYERS ON THE SYSTEMS LATE INSTALLATION SERVICE WARRANTY. SO. BY INCREASING THE THE ATTACKS OR INPUT WITHOUT TIME ACTUALLY INCREASE SEVENTY THREE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR. TAL TAXPAYERS MOM POCKET. THEREFORE EVERYBODY BELIEVE. THAT DECISION WAS VERY MEANINGLESS. SO TODAY'S MARCH [INAUDIBLE] SUGGESTION ORG. HI TO ALL THE EXPERTS HERE. IF WE CAN DO IT LISTEN TO TODAY'S SITUATION. ON THE IMPORT GO. IT THAT WE CAN DO AN INTERNAL -- INCREASE THE STATE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. LIKE WE DID BACK. TO TWENTY ELEVEN THAT WE OFFER. A TO SELL. THEM. KLEIMAN ON THE GREEN TICK BUDGET THAT TIME. AND SECOND THAT THE CITY. WHERE I LIVE FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS SEE THE FREMONT? THE WAY HE IMMENSELY IMPLEMENT. HE ALSO CALLED. ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TO INCORPORATE THAT SITUATION. THEREFORE WE DO NOT RELY ON TOO MUCH RAW MATERIAL OR OR DELIVERING TENNIS OF ASSEMBLY BRING STEP WOULD PUT EMPHASIS IS. ON THE SYSTEM ASSEMBLY INSTALLATION OTHERS SO THOSE SOMETHING I SURELY HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK OUT. TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS ON THE TAX EXEMPTION. IN THE OTHER ISSUE THAT CAN WE MENTION ANY. FROM A LOCAL LEVEL BABY I CAN GIVE THE EXAMPLE HOW WE WERE ABLE TO DO SOME OF THE ISSUES AS WELL. WITH KING AND IN TERMS OF AS THE STATE TERRACE ARE. AS IN HOW DO WE COUNTED AT IN LOS ANGELES AND PREVIOUSLY WE WE'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO BRING -- INTERNATIONAL FOREIGN INVESTOR COMING TO LOS ANGELES BEEN UP THEIR HEADQUARTERS AND WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE THEM INCENTIVES BUT WE CAN'T GIVE IT DIRECTLY TO JUST ONE COMPANY SO WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOKED AT THE SECTORS THAT WE WE WANT TO FOCUS ON WHICH IS CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. AND WE WORK WITH THE POOR LOS ANGELES -- PART OF LONG BEACH IT'S SPECIFICALLY PART OF LOS IS WAS ABLE TO REDUCE. AS FOR ALL -- ZERO ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE -- PROCESS THE PORT LOS ANGELES ONLY THROUGH THEIR THEIR OWN TAX STRUCTURE SO FROM A LOCAL LEVEL WAY TO DO THAT SAID I THINK -- IF WE CAN PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO A BIGGER AND SENSE OF THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL BUT NOT POINT WAS TO COME X. WHICH IS NEEDED MOVE QUICK SO WE DID AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- I'M SURE THAT YOU KNOW WITH LOS ANGELES CITY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY THEY HAVE SOME MORE RESOURCES AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES AND SMALLER COUNTIES. I THINK THAT'S WERE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE IT IS SET UP CALIFORNIA WILL BE VERY VERY USEFUL. GREAT -- ALSO HONORED TO BE TALK ABOUT MY SAN FRANCISCO COLLEAGUES SOME OF THEM DAVID CHIU JUST WANTED. TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY HELLO HELLO -- I WANT. TO THANK. MY COLLEAGUE IN THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF ON A WELCOME TO AND VERY MUCH LOOKS TO ENGAGEMENT AND HER LEADERSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE GEN. AND AND YOUR SHIP ON THIS AS WELL AS THE BUSINESS OWNERS WE HAVE HERE. MY APOLOGIES FOR BEING LATE I'VE DRIVEN ABOUT THREE HOURS TODAY TO GO SPEAK IN ANOTHER PART OF THE BAY AND COME BACK. UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUES SINCE YOU ALSO HAD HOURS OF DRIVING THIS MORNING SO -- HERE WE ARE. BUT THEN JUST SAY A FEW THOUGHTS ON ON ON THIS TOPIC -- AS A CHINESE AMERICAN -- I SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE. THAT THE TRAIN AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND CHINA AND CALIFORNIA AND TRYING TO HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY TO OUR COMMUNITIES. TO CONTINUING TO FOSTER THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT I THINK WE AND AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- THE TRAIN. THAT WAS STARTED BY THE OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN THIS REGARD AND HAS BEEN HELPFUL I AM OF THE PERSPECTIVES TRADE WARS. DO NOT. HELP ANYONE. IT TURNS FOLKS AND SECTORS AND INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES AND WORKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT WAR AND SO. IT IS. MY HOPE FROM THIS PARTICULAR DISCUSSION AND OTHERS IS THAT THERE ARE GOOD IDEAS THAT ARE COMING OF WHAT WE CAN DO. GIANT THE TRAY TAFT DISCUSSION ON TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD AN AGENDA THAT MAKES SENSE FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA. FOR TRADE IN GENERAL AND FOR OUR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY -- THAT WE CAN BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT AND AND AND I MY HOPE IS THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. ASSUME THE TERM SEND -- THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BE WELL POSITIONED TO MOVE FOR OUR ECONOMY ON THAT SO. I KNOW THERE'S ONLY BEEN GOOD DISCUSSION ON THAT BUT MY STAFF HAS BEEN HERE TAKING SOME NOTES ON HOW WE CAN HELP JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO TO OUR WORK TOGETHER ON THIS [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. WHAT WOULD JUMP BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ONE SECOND I DID HAVE A QUESTION TO FOLLOW UP ON? MR GREENS. RIGHT WHICH IS REALLY NOT PART OF OUR DISCUSSION BUT YOU WOULD AND YOUR CONCERN ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT. CHINESE AMERICANS NOT CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY ALL OVER THE U. S. B. AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. CHINESE AMERICANS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ANYBODY ELSE WANT. TO COMMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE STE IN ANY INCREASE IN TENSIONS ARE REALLY HAVE AN IMPACT. IN OUR COMMUNITY THERE. WELL I'M AS IT HAPPENS MIGHT THAT HIGH SCHOOL SON IS HERE AND HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THREE WEEKS -- THAT UNIVERSITY PROGRAM AS AN INTERN. I AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION BEFORE HE LAUGHED. TALKING ABOUT. LEAD THE CHANGE IN THE CLIMATE. AS A RESULT OF THIS. DISPUTE AND BEEN IN CHINA A FEW WEEKS BEFORE AND AS WAS MENTIONED. AND WE SPEND A BIT OF TIME I MEETING AND GREETING PEOPLE ONE HEARING CALIFORNIA FROM CHURCH AND OTHERS -- FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND THERE IS CHEST. IT CHANGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE CLIENT. YOU. FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE DEFENSIVENESS ON BOTH SIDES. YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE HOSTILITY. I AND IT I AGAIN. YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR WHAT. BECAUSE AS I'VE NOW SAID SEVERAL TIMES. THOUGH THE THREE A ONE COMPLAINTS AND AND DECISIONS ARE VERY VERY RECALL. WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER THE FOR ALL BY [INAUDIBLE] I NOW THAT THE PRESSURE OF THE TERRACE HAS BEEN CREATED. IT REALLY BEHOOVES NO. ONE TO ACCEPT THIS NEW STATUS QUO. I'M. GETTING TO SOME KIND OF AGREE SENATE RESOLUTION. AT THAT WE CAN QUICKLY GET BACK TO YOU FRIENDLY FEELINGS. I'M IS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND AS I MENTIONED I'M GONNA BE RUNNING OUT OF HERE AB OR REGENTS MEETING. AT PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT. 10% OF THE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE UC SYSTEM OUR FOREIGN NATIONALS FROM CHINA. I'M NOW WE HAVE A COURSE CHINESE AMERICANS AND ROLLED IN THE UC SYSTEM. OUT THERE AMERICANS THESE CHINESE NATIONALS WHO HAVE BEEN COMING HERE HAVE. I I CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING CULTURAL EXCHANGE COOPERATION IT'S IT'S A IT'S A FOUNDATIONAL I THINK WE HEARD YOU KNOW THE PERSON TO PERSON EXCHANGES HOW IMPORTANT FOR MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. I'M SO. I THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE HEARD ABOUT. IS REALLY ATTENTION OF TRADE. THAT TURNS INTO TENSION OVER OTHER THINGS. I'M AND AGAIN FOR WHAT I'M WE KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO GO WE KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO CATCH. I'M THE THE AT THE PARTIES HAVE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE I AM VERY HOPEFUL MISTER DEPUTY CONSUL GENERAL THAT YOU WILL DELIVER BACK. TO AT AT TO BEIJING THAT CALIFORNIA WANTS TO GET BACK TO YOU I HAVING AN ENVIRONMENT. SHARED MUTUAL COOPERATION. IT APPEARS THAT IT WILL REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF COMPROMISE -- RESOLUTION OF THE THREE OH ONE PLANES -- BUT IT IS MOST CERTAINLY AND ALL OF OUR INTERESTS FOR A MULTITUDE OF REASONS NOT LEAST OF WHICH I'M THE CLIMATE OF FRIENDSHIP. I THAT WE COME TO SOME KIND OF IT AND AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION OVER THERE IN THE BACK. ALEX. ALEX WITH [INAUDIBLE] SECOND. THANKS A GERMAN GERMAN TANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR THIS HEARINGS BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE AND IN VERY HONEST DISCUSSION. REALLY APPRECIATE IT -- MY NAME IS KERR GIBBS. ACTUALLY FROM THE CENSUS GO BAY AREA AND LIVING IN CHINA FOR MOST OF US TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR SO. I'M CURRENT THE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SHANGHAI. AND ACTUALLY AS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DASHES OUT OF THE ROOM I'M GOING TO MAKE THE FIRST TIME AT HER SON IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S IS THAT THE THE TENSION THAT'S BEEN CREATED -- VERY RECENTLY IS IS MOST DECIDEDLY NOT HELPFUL AND AND WE WANT TO PUT A PUT A QUICK STOP TO THAT -- I'LL JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE AMERICAN CHAMBER WE REPRESENT -- WE ARE FOUND IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN IN IN HI AND WE WERE -- OUR MISSION IS TO PROMOTE POSITIVE COMMERCIAL TIES BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND CHINA OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A VERY CHALLENGING -- ENDEAVOR RIGHT NOW WE REPRESENT WE CURRENTLY REPRESENT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS IN IN SHANGHAI THESE ARE AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT ARE. THAT ARE -- IN CHINA OF DOING BUSINESS FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY SUCCESSFUL AND AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE HEADLINES DON'T NECESSARILY CAPTURE -- BUT THE MOST OF OUR MEMBERS ARE PROFITABLE THEY ARE GROWING. AND THEIR CONTINUE TO INVEST I DO WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE THOUGHTS -- BEGIN W. CHART -- CONSUL GENERAL RAN YOU FOR TOLERATING MY COMMENTS THE OTHER DAY AND AND AND COMPLAINTS -- BUT AGAIN -- THE GOVERNOR'S CORRECT IN THAT THIS ISSUE IS ABOUT RECIPROCITY AND AND AND CALL GENERAL YOU ARE CORRECT ABOUT. THE RELATIONSHIP IS SHIFTED MUCH MORE TO SERVICES AND AND THAT HAS -- BEEN REFLECTED IN OUR MEMBERSHIP SHIFTING FROM MANUFACTURING OVER TO SERVICES. ASIAN SHIP DOES HAVE TO BE RECIPROCAL -- I THINK THAT -- AB CPAS TAKE EXAMPLE WHILE BROUGHT FORWARD -- BY MR GREEN WAS ABOUT OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS IN A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE THAT REFLECTS RIGHT HERE A FORM YOUR PAYPAL. SO PAYPAL ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AFTER THE CHINA MARKET FULLY EXPECTING TO TO ENJOY BY. RAMP UP ANY COMMERCE WITH CHINA. AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS WE'RE NEVER GRANTED A DOMESTIC LICENSE TO DO ARM BE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN CHINA. OUR TWENTY NINETEEN OF ALL THE PAY WE CHECK A ARE ENTERING CALIFORNIA ENTERING UNITED STATES WE WELCOME THAT ABSOLUTELY A GOOD THING. BUT IT'S A GLARING EXAMPLE OF OF LACK OF RECIPROCITY. I THINK CHINA WOULD DO WELL. TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE PS EXAMPLES AND WHAT I WOULD. CONSIDER LOW HANGING FRUIT -- PAYPAL TRONIC PAYMENTS VISA. THE THINGS THAT -- THEY CAN ABSOLUTELY BE DONE. BUT BUT BOTTOM LINE -- WE HAVE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS -- FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE MATTER IN THIS THIS TRADE CONFLICT. OF WE AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT IT DOES NEED A ROOT OF TO BE REBALANCED. WE DON'T AGREE WITH WITH THE WAY THAT IT'S BEING DONE -- THE TERRORISTS. THE TERRORISTS AND THE WAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS HANDLING THIS THIS IS NOT PRODUCTIVE. DRAGGING THIS ON FAR TOO LONG TERRORISTS DON'T HELP YOU. ONE AND WE'RE THERE IS DANGER OF UP DAMAGING. OF PERMANENTLY DAMAGING A RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS. BOTH FOR THE STATE'S AND FOR CHINA WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A UP A QUICK RESOLUTION TO TO THE CURRENT CONFLICT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING THIS VERY PRODUCTIVE SO I DID I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION. FOR FOR FOR YOU SINCE YOU MENTIONED THE WHOLE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT ISSUE I NOTICED WHEN I WAS IN CHINA LAST TO SEE HER. AS A TOURIST HOW. HOW FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY TO CASH? IT WAS WEIRD TO PRESCRIBE LIKE I I CAN'T GET THE PAY -- USE CHAPTER PAYS SO WE'RE FOR TOURISM HAVE YOU SEEN OR HAVE YOU HEARD COMPLAINTS FOR FOR TOURISTS. I FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU BUY THINGS HOW DO YOU PAY FOR THINGS. YEAH WE HAVE A BE THAT THAT IS SO THAT IS A COMMON COMPLAINT TO THINK CHINA IS. IS BECOMING MUCH MORE INWARD LOOKING AT THIS IS A POLITICAL QUESTION IT'S A DOMESTIC ISSUE WITHIN CHINA THAT THAT THEY NEED TO RESOLVE. AND THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW TIGHTLY INTEGRATED THEY WANT TO BE. WITH THE REST OF THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT -- IT IS DIFFICULT FOR TOURISTS AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR FOREIGN BUSINESSES OPERATING IN CHINA HAVING SAID THAT -- I WOULD ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF NEW WANTS TO WHAT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND HER SON OF MENTIONED ABOUT ABOUT THE MOOD IN CHINA WITH RESPECT TO AMERICAN BUSINESSES THERE. OVERALL ESPECIALLY AT THE LAW SCHOOL THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL AND PROVINCIAL LEVEL THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY VERY VERY WELCOMING OF AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND AMERICAN INVESTMENT. THE CONFLICT IS REALLY AT THE BEIJING WASHINGTON LEVEL AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC SECOND -- THE MOOD VERY MUCH SHIFTED POST WHILE WAY -- THE MOOD EARLIER SO IN OTHER WORDS THIS NEGATIVE SENTIMENT THAT THE TENANT GOVERNOR MENTIONED. FOR TWO WAS -- DID NOT START AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS THE SO CALLED TRADE WAR IT STARTED. MUCH MORE POST. A TENTH AFTER THE WALK AWAY AND CERTAINLY AFTER THE RESTORATION PUT AWAY ON THE END LIST. BEFORE THAT. I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF SUPPORT. THE CHINESE PEOPLE FOR LEGITIMATE REFORM WITHIN CHINA THAT WAS PROMPTED BY A REBALANCING OF THE RELATIONSHIP MOST PEOPLE MIGHT MY CHINESE FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES IN PEOPLE THAT I INTERACT WITH. AND EVEN AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WE'RE ACTUALLY SUPPORT OF A REBALANCING OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT ENTIRELY SHIFTED AFTER -- WHILE WE WERE PLACED ON ENTITIES LIST. BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHILE WAY IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE ONE IS. MAKING A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL SECURITY DECISION. TO TO RESTRICT WHAT PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE EMBEDDED IN OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ONE QUESTION. THE SECOND QUESTION IS AN EXISTENTIAL QUESTION ABOUT SHOULD WE ALLOW ONE WAY TO EVEN EXIST. AND BY PLACING IT ON THE ENTITIES LIST AND DOING IT IN SUCH SUCH AN OF AN AFFRONT.
