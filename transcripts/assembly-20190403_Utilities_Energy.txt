CALL TO ORDER THE YOU STILL IT UTILITY ENERGY AND COMMITTEE HEARING. A WE ARE SHORT OF A QUORUM AT THE MOMENT -- BUT WE WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THEN WHEN WE WILL. TRANSITION ONCE WE HAVE A A QUORUM PRESENT -- MISTER BIGELOW WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE YOU -- YOUR FILE ITEM. A NUMBER THREE BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE -- AND JUST FOR HOUSEKEEPING PURPOSES OF EDUARDO GARCIA IS ABSENT TODAY -- AND MAJORITY LEADER -- CALDERON WILL BE FILLING IN AND HAS A PLACE. AND THEN WE HAVE ONE ITEM. THAT SHOWS ON CALENDAR -- ITEM FOR A. B.. NINE EIGHTY THREE WARNER -- HORVATH -- THAT'S OFF CALENDAR AND THAT WILL BE HELD AS A TO YOUR BILL [inaudible] WITH -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT IS TO SHARE WITH EVERYONE AND SO -- WILL TURN TO YOU MISTER BIGELOW I WILL TAKE YOUR TESTIMONY. AND THEN WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM WE WILL -- WE GET A MOTION AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE THANK YOU FOR YOURS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT AB. EIGHT SIX EIGHT WHICH CODIFIES THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF PROTOCOLS DURING A VOLUNTARY DE ENTERED J. AT THE ENTERED CHAI'S STATION. HAT'S A BIG WORD. YEAH BY HANNAH LECTER CORPORATION AS WE ALL KNOW ELECTRIC UTILITIES ARE INCREASINGLY DE ENERGIZING ELECTRICAL GRIDS AS A WILDFIRE MITIGATION TOOL. WELL THE DE ENERGIZED STATION HAS PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE IT ULTIMATELY LEADS CUSTOMERS IN THE DARK LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY. MEMBERS THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILLHAVE PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE DURING THE A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. AS VOLUNTARY POWER SHUT OFF BECOME OUR NEW NORMAL IT'S IMPERATIVE OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES SCHOOLS HOSPITALS. AND MEDICALLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE PROVIDED CERTAINTY WITH CONSISTENT RELIABLE COMMUNICATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND THE STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES CONTINUED WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WITH ME MISTER CHAIRMAN TODAY IS MISTER BOB REAP. REPRESENTING THE ELDORADO IRRIGATION DISTRICT -- FOR SOME SUPPORT TESTIMONY OR HE HAS SOME WORDS -- PREPARED IF YOU'RE WILLING TO HAVE WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT BUT SINCE WE HAVE A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL ABSOLUTELY ESTABLISH OR SO. BROKE UP WITH HOLDEN. PRESENT PATTERSON [inaudible] BURKE [inaudible] CARILLO [inaudible] CHEN [inaudible] CUNNINGHAM [inaudible] EGGMAN [inaudible] CRISTINA GARCIA [inaudible] CALDERON [inaudible] MAYES [inaudible] MURATSUCHI. QUIRK HERE. REYES [inaudible] SANTIAGO. OKAY WE'LL HEAR FROM YOUR WITNESS MOVING THIS WONDERFUL BILL. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN US AS AMENDED SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BABRI BUT WITH READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF ELDORADO IRRIGATION DISTRICT THE SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE. LAST SUMMER WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WAS DISCUSSING -- THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF AS AND AS A PART OF THE BROADER ISSUES SURROUNDING WILD FIRE MITIGATION AND PREVENTION PLANNING. WE WE TRIED TO BRING FORWARD THE THE IMPACTS THAT FALL ON WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS AS A RESULT OF THE P. S. P. S. OCCURRENCES [inaudible] WE HAVE. ABOUT -- TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF SERVICE TERRITORY BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN FOUR THOUSAND FOOT ELEVATION IT'S UP IN THE FOOT HILLS TO THE EAST OF HERE. AND SO WE RELY ON A LOT OF LIVE STATIONS. THAT ARE. SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE SERVICE AREA WE ALSO RELY ON REFILLING OUR STORAGE TANKS -- THAT PUT PRESSURE INTO THE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORT FIRE HYDRANTS AND DRINKING WATER. WHEN THE POWER SHUT OFF WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM? NUMBER ONE THE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS DON'T OPERATE CAPACITY SO YOU CAN ONE CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST ON A HUNDRED AND TEN DAY THAT'S WHEN THE IN THE POWER GET SHUT OFF. WE LOSE DRINKING WATER WE LOSE THE ABILITY TO REFILL OUR STORAGE TANKS WE LOSE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THOSE FIRE HYDRANTS ARE OPERATIONAL. SIMILARLY ON THE WASTE WATER SIDE WHEN THE POWER SET OFF WE CAN'T LIVE THE SEWAGE. TO GET TO THE TREATMENT PLANT AND WHEN WE HAVE SEWAGE BACKING UP IT COMES OUT IN DIFFERENT. PLACES IN THE LOWER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM PEOPLE'S HOMES A MAN HOLES WEEK WE HAVE THE RISK OF OVER FLOWS INTO CREEKS AND RIVERS UP THERE. SO IT'S A REAL CONCERN FOR US WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SENDS A CLEAR SIGNAL TO THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH THE WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITIES. AND WORK ON PROTOCOLS AND AND WAYS TO EITHER AVOID OR MITIGATE THESE POTENTIAL PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACTS WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK AND REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I WILL TAKE -- JUST ME TUESDAY OUT IF WE COULD -- IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON NIKOLINA NONE OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC AS PART.

I WOULD SAY ABOUT A THIS RUBIO WELCOME -- WE'RE HERE -- TO HERE YOUR PRESENTATION ON A BEFORE. NINETY ONE THANK YOU I WAS NUMBER ONE IN ANOTHER COMEDIAN NUMBER ONE HERE TO SOLVE THE KITCHEN I APPRECIATE YOU BEING PATIENT -- I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOUR BILL HAS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS GOT IT. GOT IT. I DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU AVAIL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M PRESENTING ITS ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR NINETY ONE A MEASURE CANNELLA CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL USE OF HYDROGEN CONCENTRATION IN CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL GAS SYSTEM. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING -- THIS SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN OUR COMMENTS TO AND COMMENT FOR OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE. CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUOUSLY SET STANDARDS FOR REDUCING CARBON% EMISSIONS AND IS A LEADER FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION. WELL CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS IT IS ALL IT ALSO EMITS THE SECOND MOST TO GREENHOUSE GASES OUT OF ALL FIFTY STATES. REDUCING GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS WITH WITHOUT CRIPPLING OUR ENERGY SECTOR IS A DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX TAX. TASK THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY BEING ADDRESSED BY OUR SEATS -- BRIGHTEST MINDS OF THE PROMISING ENERGY SOURCES OF CARBON NEUTRALITY HYDROGEN HAS IMMENSE POTENTIAL AND REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. HYDROGEN IS A HIGHLY EN EL ENERGETIC MONOCLE MOLECULE THAT IS NOT ONLY CARBON FREE BUT ALSO RENEWABLE. I IN 201730% OF THE US ENERGY CONSUMPTION WAS DELIVERED VIA NATURAL GAS. NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED INTHE U. S. OVER DECADES OF INVESTMENT AND COMPLEX PLANNING. TO DEVELOP AN EQUIVALENT SYSTEM BY HYDROGEN WOULD BE EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE AND NOT REALISTIC WITH CURRENT MEANS TO PROVIDE HYDROGEN TO STATE TO A STATE OF MORE THAN FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. HOWEVER PROMISING RESEARCH HAS ALSO ALREADY BEEN STARTED AND IMPLEMENTED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN NATIONS DEMONSTRATING THE EFFICACY OF USING EXISTING NATURAL GAS LINES FOR HYDROGEN DISTRIBUTION UP TO CONCENTRATIONS OF 20%. BECAUSE NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY BY LOCATION. THE EFFECTS OF BLENDING IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRING ASSESSMENT BASE. AND THAT'S THAT'S MEANT BASED ON OUR EXISTING SYSTEMS AB FOR NINETY ONE WILL COME A WILL COMMISSION THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO PROCURE A STUDY THAT ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF BLENDING HYDROGEN. INTO EXISTING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE WITH CONCENTRATIONS UP WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TIM CARMICHAEL ON BEHALF OF SEMPRA ENERGY THE SPONSOR OF AB -- FOUR NINETY ONE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. GERALD IN A BRIEF STATEMENT A TIM CARMICHAEL SEMPRA ENERGY UTILITIES -- FIRST TO THANK YOU THE AUTHOR FOR CARRYING THIS MEASURE AS WE DISCUSSED WITH MANY OF YOU -- WE BELIEVE HAS CALIFORNIA INCREASES IT'S RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO -- THERE'S A GROWING AWARENESS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ADEQUATE ENERGY STORAGE CAPACITY WE THINK HUNDRED HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION. WE ALSO SEE A GROWING AWARENESS -- AND OUR COMPANY BELIEVES STRONGLY IN. EFFORTS TO DE CARBONIZED THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM AND WE SEE HYDROGEN PLAYING A ROLE IN THAT AS IT HAS IN EUROPE -- WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN GALLERY TO RELIVE Là HOST PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY. FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK. NEED A CUP FOR COALITION FOR ANY OF THE NATURAL GAS WE ARE SUPPORT ALSO SUSTAINABLE AND USES OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS INCLUDING AT THE PRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE HYDROGEN SO WE AT URGE YOUR SUPPORT TO A THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON GAS ELECTRICITY -- CRANKS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. I'LL HANDLE IT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF BLOOM ENERGY IN SUPPORT. HI ALLIGATOR ON BEHALF OF ENERGY WE ALSO SUPPORT. AND MICHAEL BOOKER ON BEHALF OF A CA WE ARE NOT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE ARE ALSO NOT IN OPPOSITION WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION. WE HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND TO THE SPONSOR WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE COST IMPLICATION LANGUAGE IN THE BILL BEEFED UP. NOT LOOKING JUST THE COST OF PRODUCING HYDROGEN BUT THE COST IMPLICATIONS FOR RATEPAYERS AS MANY OF YOU'VE ALL SEEN PROBABLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SO CAL GAS IS MADE SEVERAL ANNOUNCEMENT IT'S ABOUT BECOMING THE CLEANEST. GAS UTILITY IN THE COUNTRY BY PUTTING 20% RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IN THE PIPELINE BY. TWENTY THIRTY NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 20% HYDROGEN IN THE PIPELINE BOTH ARE IN G. AND HYDROGEN ARE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND SO THE COST IMPLICATIONS ON RATE PAYERS NEED TO BE WELL UNDERSTOOD. IT'S NOT SIMPLY ABOUT PUTTING THIS RENEWABLE GAS INTO THE PIPELINE IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR OUR LARGE AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS SO WE'D LIKE TO GET SOME FURTHER AMENDMENTS THAT TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE COST IMPLICATIONS THANK YOU. RESPECT THAT. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE WHO HAS A IN BETWEEN POSITION OR NO POSITION ON THIS BILL. SEEING NONE WILL TURN TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YES WE ARE MISTER. THE QUESTION WITH RESPECT -- TO THE COST THAT WAS JUST RAISED -- CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. A BET I MEAN I I I REPRESENT A LOT OF FOLKS THAT. OUR HI AG ELECTRICITY USERS -- BUTTON. HELP HELP US OUT UNDERSTANDING. THE COST QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED HERE. SO. WE ALSO CARE A LOT ABOUT THE COST IF IT IF IT DOESN'T PENCIL OUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEN IT'S NOT REALLY A VIABLE SOLUTION -- ONE OF THE BIG CHANGE IS HAPPENING IN OUR WORLD TODAY AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES IS WE NOT ONLY HAVE A A GROWING RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO WE HAVE EXCESS. RENEWABLE ENERGY BEING GENERATED AND THE VISION FOR COST EFFECTIVE HYDROGEN REALIZE QUITE A BIT ON THAT EXCESS RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO -- BEING AVAILABLE TO GENERATE VERY LOW COST OR FREE. ENERGY WHEN THE REST OF THE GREAT DOESN'T NEED IT. I WE SEE THAT AS A BIG PART OF THE COST CONTROL COSTS MANAGEMENT FOR THE HYGIENE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. ON FORMER ENERGY SECRETARY CHU ACTUALLY AS A PIECE OUT. TODAY OR YESTERDAY SPEAKING TO THIS ON A NATIONAL SCALE -- SO I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THE LEAD ON THIS IN A MINUTE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT OTHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE TAKING A GOOD LOOK AT IT [inaudible] TOO OKAY. APPRECIATE THAT SO IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL ON THEM -- I'M SORRY. FOR YOUR CALL FOR IN BETWEEN POSITIONS AND NO POSITIONS ARE NOT OPPOSITE MY APOLOGIES NO PROBLEM -- LAUREN CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE OPPOSE OF A. B. -- FOR NINETY ONE WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS CLIMB AND GREENHOUSEGAS REDUCTION TARGETS THE STATE MUST STOP RELYING ON ITS NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. THE IDEA OF USING HYDROGEN AN EXISTING NATURAL GRASS GRID HAS BEEN ANALYZED IN VERY STUDIES GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. THIS RESEARCH HAS ALREADY DISCLOSE THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH INJECTING HYDROGEN INTO THE PIPELINES HYDROGEN IS A SMALLER MOLECULES IN GAS GIVING IT A FASTER LEE COULD TRADE IN A MORE POTENT CORROSIVE EFFECT ON METALS. BLENDING HUNDRED AND CAN MATERIAL DEGREE MATERIAL THE TO GRADE PIPELINES DESIGN FOR NATURAL GAS THIS HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT OF THE PIPING LEADS TO A HIGHER RISK OF DANGEROUS LEAKS. WE DO NOT WANT TO EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH CALIFORNIA ITS ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE SUBJECTED TO PIPELINE LEAKS. AGAIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MUST PHASE OUT THE USE OF NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. TIME AND EFFORT SHOULD BE SPENT ON GETTING US OFF PUTTING GAS ENTIRELY WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE TRUE CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES LIKE WIND AND SOLAR IN ORDER TO MEET OUR TARGETS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THIS ROUTE -- THIS RECIPE. THANK YOU AND WITH THE COMMENTS FROM THE SIERRA CLUB I THINK OF A GREAT CONCERNED ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN. IS THIS THE THE THE IS A IN THEIR STATEMENT THEY TALKED ABOUT A HIGHER RISK OF CORROSION AND LEAKS. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN. WELL THAT'S THE POINT OF THE BILL THAT WE ARE -- COMMISSIONING THE CALIFORNIA C. COUNTY COUNCIL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO DO THE STUDY AND SO IF THAT'S THE CASE WE'RE NOT. IMPLEMENTING ANYTHING THIS IS JUST PACIFIC LEAD TO GET A STUDY TO SEE WHERE WE ARE YES THERE HAS BEEN OTHER. ACCORDING TO WHAT SHE SAID -- STUDIES ALL THIS STUDY WOULD GIVE US THAT INFORMATION OF CURRENT INFORMATION -- IN REAL TIME AND SO THIS IS JUST THE STUDY AND IF IT DOESN'T BOB. PENCIL OUT AND IT DOESN'T -- BUT THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR STUDY. IF IF I MAY UM IF A STUDY HAS BEEN DONE WOULD YOU WORK WITH SHARE CLUB TO SEE WHAT THE STUDY WITH THE SCOPE OF THAT STUDY WAS. TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY CAUSING A DANGER THAT WE WE STEER AWAY FROM THAT -- BECAUSE CERTAINLY NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THESE LEAKS IN THEIR COMMUNITY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. OF THIS MESSAGE THANK YOU -- I HAVE TO ADMIT I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT. TO HYDROGEN COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW HYDROGEN IS -- RENEWABLE. SO TODAY -- HYDROGEN IS PRODUCED IN AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT WAYS -- FROM FOSSIL NATURAL GAS BY YOU PUT IT THROUGH A PROCESS YOU MOVE THE CARBON AND YOU'VE GOT HODGEN. YOU CAN TAKE ANY -- ORGANIC BASED RENEWABLE GAS FROM A GETTING WAY STREAM COULD BE. ORGANIC MATERIALS COMING OUT OF URBAN AREAS COULD BE AGRICULTURAL ORGANIC WASTE SIMILAR PROCESS REMOVE THE CARBON YOU GOT HIGH JIM LEFT OVER. THE THIRD PROCESS WHICH HAS GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION RECENTLY IS WHAT'S CALLED ELECTROLYTIC -- HYDROGEN WHICH IS BACK TO OUR HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY CLASS WHERE YOU RUN ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH A A JAR OF WATER AND THAT CREATES OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN. YOU CAN DO THAT ON A ON A LARGER SCALE. BACK TO MR PATTERSON'S QUESTION ABOUT COST IF YOU'RE ELECTRICITY IS VERY LOW COST OR FREE THAT PROCESS STARTS TO BECOME. MORE AND MORE ECONOMICAL -- SO ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE IN PLAY TODAY AND WE AS A COMPANY AND AS A SECTOR. INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING HODGEN THINK THAT ALL THREE SHOULD. UNDERGO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. AND ALL THREE ARE EQUALLY AT THIS POINT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE. TODAY MOST HYGIENIST PRODUCED FROM A A FOSSIL GAS BUT IT'S THE SAME TECHNOLOGY. AND PROCESS. FOR PRODUCING IT FROM OUR NOBLE GAS AND ON THE ELECTROLYTIC IT IS. A EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF GROWING THAT TO SCALE FOR COMMERCIAL USE MORE THAN YOU KNOW TAKING BASICALLY FROM THE LAB OF THE PROJECT TWO YES WE CAN REPLICATE THIS ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IS FOR REAL YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.
