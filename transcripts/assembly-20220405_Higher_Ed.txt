THANK YOU DR CHOI. THANK YOU. SO MOVING BACK IN BILL FILE ORDER FILE ORDER NUMBER ONE. OF MISTER ROBERTS. WHENEVER YOU ARE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. WELCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- TODAY I'M PRESENTING AB BILL- SIXTEEN OH SIX- THIS BILL MAKES THREE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE COLLEGE FEE WAIVER FOR THE VETERANS DEPENDENTS PROGRAM THE FIRST CHANGE THE PROGRAM THE LOWER THE DISABILITY RATING REQUIRED FOR THE SPOUSE OF A COMBAT DISABLED VETERAN TO QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM FROM A 100% TO SEVENTY PERCENT. UNDER THE PROGRAM AS IT STANDS THE DEPENDENT CHILDREN OF A VETERAN DISABLED AT ANY RATING ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE WAIVER BUT SPOUSES HAVE TO MEET THIS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH STANDARD. AS WE KNOW NOT ALL FAMILIES LOOK THE SAME AND NOT ALL COUPLES HAVE CHILDREN. THIS EXCLUSION IS ARGUABLY DISCRIMINATORY AND EXCLUDES MANY DESERVING PEOPLE FROM WHOSE VETERANS SPOUSES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DISABLED. THE SECOND CHANGE WOULD ELIMINATE THE PROHIBITION AGAINST CONCURRENT RECEIPT OF FEDERAL EDUCATION BENEFITS FOR DEPENDENT SPOUSES. IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE FROM THIS BENEFIT WHEN WE HAVE ALREADY DEEMED THEM TO SERVING. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE RECEIVING A NOMINAL STIPEND OR OTHER SUPPORT AIMED AT HELPING THEM. COMPLETE THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION. THE THIRD CHANGE WHAT A MAN THE INCOME THRESHOLD FOR THE MEANS TESTED DEPENDENT CHILD WAIVER FROM THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO AREA MEDIAN INCOME. CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST ACCEPT EXPENSIVE STATE IN THE NATION AND THE FELLOW FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS SIMPLY TOO LOW A THRESHOLD TO USED TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE FROM SUPPORT. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CARLA SAY HOUSE WHOSE SPOUSE IS A 100% DISABLED. MISTER CHAIR OF BY WITNESS CAN BEFORE YES PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM CARLESS SAY HAAS FROM MERCED I AM A MILITARY SPOUSE MY HUSBAND SERVED TWENTY YEARS IN THE ARMY AS A MEDIC HE IS A COMBAT VETERAN WHO IS 1100% VA SERVICE CONNECTED DISABLED. I AM ALSO A PHD STUDENT AT UC MERCED I AM HERE AS AN INDIVIDUAL IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTY NO SIX WHICH AMENDS THE CALVET FEE WAIVER THAT CAN BE USED AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CSU OR UC. CURRENTLY UNDER PLAN A SPOUSES CAN ONLY BENEFIT FROM THE FEE WAIVER IF THE VETERAN IS DISABLED AND SERVE DURING A PERIOD OF WAR PLAN B. EXCLUDE SPOUSES AND SUPPORTS CHILDREN'S OF VETERANS WHO HAVE A 0% VA SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY RATING OR HIGHER AND DOES NOT REQUIRE WARTIME SERVICE. THIS DISCRIMINATES AGAINST MILITARY SPOUSES SPOUSES OFTEN PUT THEIR EDUCATION AND CAREERS ON HOLD WHILE THE SERVICE MEMBERS SERVED ON ACTIVE DUTY AB SIXTEEN OH SIX WILL GIVE SPOUSES THE CHANCE TO FURTHER THEIR EDUCATION IT ALSO PROVIDES A SOLUTION FOR SPOUSES RECEIVE CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE BENEFITS DUE TO THEIR VETERAN SPOUSE BEING 1100% VA SERVICE CONNECTED DISABLED. I PERSONALLY RECEIVED CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE BENEFITS TO THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION THAT AMOUNTS TO ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR WHICH IS THE MAX ALLOWED MEANT THIS BENEFIT IS FOR THIRTY SIX MONTHS CURRENTLY UNDER PLAN A OF THE CALVET FEE WAIVERS SPOUSES RECEIVE CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VA CANNOT ALSO USE THE CALVET FEE WAIVER. UNDER PLAN B. CHILDREN OF VETERANS ARE ALLOWED TO USE CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE BENEFITS AND THE CALVET FEE WAIVER AT THE SAME TIME THE AMENDMENT I WOULD SUGGEST BE ADDED TO AB SIX YOU KNOW SIX IS THE ABILITY TO USE THE CALVET FEE WAIVER AT ANY CSU OR UC EXTENSION PROGRAM CURRENTLY THIS IS NOT AN OPTION. A PLAN COMPLETION OF THESE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE COMMITMENT OF MONTHS NOT YEARS VETERAN DEPENDENTS CAN OBTAIN JOBS THAT PROVIDE THEM WITH THE LIVING WAGE WE MUST CREATE AN PASSED POLICIES WHICH DECREASE BARRIERS AND INCREASE SUPPORT FOR POST NINE ELEVEN. I FAMILIES. AB SIX- SIX WILL BE A BENEFIT TO ALL CALIFORNIA VETERAN FAMILIES ONCE PASSED. PLEASE VOTE YES AN ADVANCE AB SIXTEEN OH SIX THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

ANY OTHER TWEETERS IN ON THE LINE. NO OTHER LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME WE'LL GO TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR TRYING. THANK YOU CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS- I THINK THIS IS A VERY- SENSITIVE- AND THE QUINCY CONSIDERED BE ALL THAT YOU ARE PRESENTING- RB IN SUPPORT OF THAT UP BUT I HAVE A QUESTION I WONDER IF- THIS BILL IS A TARGETED- HELPING SPOUSES OR DISABLED ARE VETERANS- THEY SHOULD BE ALSO FULLY QUALIFIED THE FULL OR THE ALEXA- CAL GRAND MOFF APPS ARE. FEDERAL AND A STATE- RESOURCES UP MARK FROM MY UNDERSTANDING PLENTY OF THE NOT COVERED ENOUGH FOR- SO THAT THE YOU ARE A INTRODUCED THIS B. R. TO SPECIFICALLY. WAIVE THAT TUITION. HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO THAT THE RE THAT THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN SUFFICIENT. THE NECESSITATE THIS BEEN DID THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS WHAT IS MEANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THOSE DESERVING OF THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES ARE THERE THAT ARE QUALIFIED FOR OTHERS THE SPECIFICALLY THE- DEPENDENT CHILDREN OF- SOMEONE THAT'S DISABLED BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR SPOUSES ARE INCLUDED ALSO FOUGHT WITHIN THAT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO FURTHER THEIR EDUCATION IT ALSO LOOKS AT- LOW RISK THAT AREA FROM A DISABLED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE BEING ABLE TO GET THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES THAT WERE PROMISED- FOR THE SERVICE- THAT NOW HAS A DISABLED VETERAN. WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY. OKAY SO THIS BILL- WILL ONLY WAIVE THE TUITION AT THIS TIME. IT'S GEARED TOWARDS LEAD AND WE'RE EVEN EVEN EVEN IF WHEN THEY GET THIS SET TUITION WAIVER WHEN THEY PSTN ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR THE EXISTING GRAND SELF FROM THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL. IF I WITNESSES WANT TO BECAUSE OUT WHAT I WAS THE STAND IS THAT THEY HAVE A CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF WHEN THEY RECEIVE THE SCHOLARSHIPS OR GRANTS SO. THEY HAVE A SUDDEN CAPITAL. AND THAT THEY CANNOT GET THAT ANY FURTHER SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DISPUTE OR DISADVANTAGE- IT GIVE A MORE DISADVANTAGES THAN NOT HELPING THEM. I BELIEVE IT WOULD NOT BE A DISADVANTAGE IT WITH EXCEL THE BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT. I KNOW THIS IS A TARGETED FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE SO WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ARE IN THE LOW INCOME CATEGORY THEY ALREADY HAVE. A PLAN ANY OTHER SOURCES OF CURRENTLY EXISTING WITH THE- THIS IS A TUITION WAIVER FOR SPOUSES AND DISABLED THE- VETERANS CELL WHERE THE THAT WOULD. ARE ACTUALLY NOT- HARMS SOME HOME IN APPLYING FORCE. FOR THOSE- ALTHOUGH- SCHOLARSHIP WALK GRANT COUPLE JUNE EIGHTIES. SO THIS BILL IS GEARED TOWARDS THE MILITARY- PERSPECTIVE OF I WAS ABLE TO VETERAN THAT'S THERE AS FAR AS THE INCOME THERE'S ALSO A COMPONENT IN THE BILL THAT DEALS WITH THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL- ASPECT OF IT TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN RANGE AS FAR AS WHERE THEY THEY LAND ON THE ECONOMIC. IMPACT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING THE RESOURCES THAT UP TO THIS POINT HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR THOSE RESOURCES MOVING FORWARD. YEAH I WOULD RECOMMEND THE FOR YOU TO LOOK INTO THAT THE WITH THIS BE A LOT WOULD BE ACTUALLY- IN NOT NOT THE HARMING THEIR OR THE- IT GRANT OPPORTUNITIES SO FROM THIS BILL. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A AN EXAMPLE FROM MY WITNESS THAT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN IN THAT SITUATION. YES THANK YOU- DOCTOR CHOICE SO I AM CURRENTLY A FULL TIME PHD STUDENT AT UC MERCED MY HUSBAND AS I MENTION IS 1100% SERVICE CONNECTED DISABLED SO I QUALIFY TO USE THE CALVET FEE WAIVER. HOWEVER AS THE SPOUSE OF A SERVICE MEMBER WHO IS A 100% VA SERVICE CONNECTED DISABLED I ALSO AM ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE BENEFITS THROUGH THE VA ADMINISTRATION. WITH THE CALVET FEE WAIVER I CANNOT USE BOTH BENEFITS AT THE SAME TIME SO I RECEIVED THE MAX AMOUNT FROM THE VA WHICH IS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND BECAUSE I TO RECEIVE THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FROM THE VA I CANNOT USE THE CALVET FEE WAIVER SO THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR SPOUSES TO USE BOTH I DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT OR PELL GRANT BECAUSE I AM IN AND- DOING THAT A GRADUATE DEGREE NOT AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE. AND SO FOR SPOUSES THIS HINDERS US AND DOESN'T ALLOW US TO FURTHER EDUCATION BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ONE OR THE OTHER BENEFITS I'M ESSENTIALLY BEING- PUT IN A POSITION WHERE I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO HELP MY- HOUSEHOLD INCOME. OR A TUITION FEE WAIVER THAT WOULD HELP ME EXCEL MY EDUCATION. GLAD TO HEAR AS LONG AS THAT THIS BILL IS NOT WILL NOT DISQUALIFY YOU FROM WHAT THE ELIGIBLE RESOURCES. NO CURRENTLY IT'S ACTUALLY DISQUALIFIES ME FROM ACCEPTING OTHER- RESOURCES SO THIS WOULD HELP ME SO THAT I COULD USE MORE RESOURCES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS IS VIOLENCE. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD YOU KNOW I'M SUPPORTING OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M SORRY EXCUSE ME ARE- MILITARY ARE VETERANS THEIR SPOUSES AND CHILDREN- IS SOMETHING THAT WE OWE TO THESE FAMILIES TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY- I DO HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH KIND OF ABOUT- CLARIFICATION ON IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A- I COUNTY APPROACH INTO THAT TOO- DEFINING THE MEDIAN INCOME SO MIKE MY QUESTION IS DOES THE MEDIAN INCOME. INCOME OF THE APPLICANT APPLY TO WHERE THE APPLICANT IS FROM OR WHERE THEY WILL BE GOING TO SCHOOL AND THE REASON WHY I ASK IS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LIVING YOU KNOW IN BAKERSFIELD THE COST OF LIVING- AND THE COST TO GO TO A COLLEGE IN BAKERSFIELD IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO STATE I'M SO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PAIRED IT WILL WORK AND WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE GONNA DEFINE. WHO WOULD QUALIFY IN TERMS OF INCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND THAT CLARIFYING POINT AND WE WILL LOOK INTO AND YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT AS FAR AS WHERE- THE RESIDENT. IT IS AS AR AS THE MEDIAN INCOME USE THEIR- AND THE ACTUAL- IT HIGHER INSTITUTION THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE APPLYING FOR RATHER IT'S RESIDENTS OR OR- OUT OF RESIDENTS- TYPE COME. COMPLIANCE SO WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT BUT THIS IS GEARED TOWARDS- MAKING SURE THAT WE DO HONOR- THE FAMILIES AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE DISABLED VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THE AND THEIR AND THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR SPOUSES SO THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE- MISTER ROBERTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS AND DIALOGUE- I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL.

AN OFF CAMPUS HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS MORE EVER AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR EXEMPTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT'SSTUDENT HOUSING ARCHITECTURAL PLANS FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO RECEIVE APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES DGS AND THE DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT DSA.

IN ADDITION TO THE COST OF TUITION OUR STUDENTS FACE ADDITIONAL EXPENSES UP OFTEN BECOME FORMIDABLE BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HIGHER EDUCATION ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE WHO ARE NOT DISPUTED TYPICAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. OF THE PAST. DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS INCREASED DEMAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT AND WHILE ISSUE. THE STATE WIDE INVENTORY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AVAILABLE FOR OUR STUDENTS IS INADEQUATE. MORE AND MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE HOUSING INSECURE. CURRENT DEFINITIONS FOR STUDENTS ARE OUT OF DATE AND SHOULD BE UPDATED SO THAT MORE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN QUALIFY FOR HOUSING VOUCHERS AND GRANTS PROGRAMS. BASED ON RESURFACED AT COMING TO COLLEGE DISTRICTS SURVEY RESULTS VERY SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. AT EACH OF OUR CAMPUSES SURVEYS ALSO SHOW THAT 18220% OF STUDENTS WOULD CONSIDER FULL TIME ENROLLMENT IF I'M ON CAP ON CAMPUS HOUSING OPTION WHERE AVAILABLE TO THEM. MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WILL ADDRESS STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR COLLEGES GUIDED PATHWAYS HELP US TO BRIDGE OUR STUDENTS TRANSITION TO FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES ALL CARRIERS. RCC STUDENTS I'M NOT THE ONLY ONES AFFECTED BY SHORTAGE. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUES. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR WILL HELP US DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE STUDENT HOUSING POLICIES ACROSS THE STREET BY INCLUDING THE COLLECTION OF STUDENT HOUSING INSECURITY DATA AT EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO STUDENT PARENTS. LGBT Q.

IN START WITH A NINETEEN SIXTY THREE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MEMBERS ON THIS BILL SHOULD BE- VERY FAMILIAR TO ALL OF YOU I BELIEVE EVERYONE VOTED FOR THIS ALREADY- THIS BILL IS A RE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL THAT WE ALL VOTED ON. LAST YEAR- BUT THIS ONE ADDRESSES THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. AB DANCING SIXTY THREE- WILL ENSURE THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE PURCHASING GENE SYNTHESIS PRODUCTS FROM RESPONSIBLE ACTORS WHO TAKE BIO SECURITY. AND THE SAFETY OF OUR COUNTRY SERIOUSLY. AS SCIENTISTS HAVE SHOWN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT VIRUSES LIKE THE COMMON NINETEEN HANDY BOWLER BY USING MAIL ORDER. DNA THAT CAN BE PURCHASED THROUGH THE INTERNET FROM GENE SYNTHESIS COMPANIES. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS THAT GENE SYNTHESIS COMPANIES NEED TO SCREEN THEIR CUSTOMERS OR THEIR ORDERS TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NOT CRIMINALS WHO MIGHT BE PURCHASING GENE SEQUENCES. THAT COULD BE ASSEMBLED INTO A DEADLY PATHOGEN. A BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE THE STATE FUNDS MUCH OF THE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH ABOUT THE CS USING UC'S IT IS IMPORTANT THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SUPPORT REASONABLE GENE SYNTHESIS SYNTHESIS COMPANIES. WHEN THEY PURCHASE RESEARCH PRODUCTS FROM THEM- WITH THAT MR CHERRY DO HAVE- TESTIMONY WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF DR GIGI A SENIOR SCHOLAR AT JOHN HOPKINS. CENTER FOR HEALTH SECURITY. AND I BELIEVE I ALSO HAVE- DR GREGORY A COUPLE INCISORS HERE PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF THE BIODEFENSE GRADUATE PROGRAM AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY. BOTH BOTH ON THE LINE YES OKAY SO MISTER MODERATOR IF WE GO TO THE WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. ON THE LINE PLEASE. THANK YOU THOSE LINES ARE OPEN. EIGHT THIS IS YOUR GRANDPA CAN YOU HEAR ME YES AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR ENTRUSTING BIO SECURITY CONCERNS ABOUT GENE SYNTHESIS OF THE SPELL AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER MY SUPPORT- I'M HE GRUMBLED AND EFFECTIVE PROFESSOR AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS CENTER FOR HEALTH SECURITY IN THE BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH- I AM MY BACKGROUND IS AND- BIOSCIENCES NICER BONTA FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR NIH AND- MERGING BIOTECH AND SECURITY. AND ALSO SERVED AS A COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORT ON BIODEFENSE IN AGES THAT ECOLOGY AND WE CONCLUDED THAT ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING BY SECURITY WITH WE FACE. IS THAT A BAD ACTOR COULD USE GENE SYNTHESIS PRODUCTS CAN MAKE PATH THAT PROFESSIONALLY- SMALL VIRUSES SH AND THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE THAT- THAT ONLY RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES- THAT SCREEN ORDERS BE USED BY CUSTOMERS- UNDER THE BELT SO SHOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR NEFARIOUS ACTORS TO ACT AT THE GENETIC MATERIAL NEEDED TO BE- TO MAKE VIRUSES LIKE SMALLPOX. OR FULLER IMPORT THEM AND- WE KNOW ABOUT THE ON GOING BECAUSE THE NINETEENTH AND DEMOCRATS- WHAT THE CLEAR DEMONSTRATION THAT IS OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN AND BY THE AFFECTED BY HEALTH SECURITY CRISIS- MANY- COMMERCIAL JEAN CITIZENS COMPANIES ALREADYVOLUNTARILY SCREEN ORDERS BUT AS THAT COST MONEY THOSE. RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES LARGELY IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE IN THE WEST HAVE BEEN AT A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS DISADVANTAGED AND SUCH BUT THAT THAT LEGISLATION WILL LET LEVEL THE GLOBAL PLAYING FIELD BUT THAT ONLY HIGH QUALITY ORGANIZATION TAKE PART IN THIS EMERGING FIELD. IT'S MY HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY FOR U. S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO PUT REGULATIONS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT DNA SYNTHESIS PRODUCTS DO NOT FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS THANK YOU. THE COMMITTEE FOR INCLUDING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP TO GUARD AGAINST BY A SECURITY THREAT AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND MISTER MODERATOR. WE GO TO THE NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

CONFLICT MASS CASUALTIES HEY I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE SITE IS WORKING GROUP AND BIOLOGICAL CHEMICAL SECURITY AT THE CENTER FOR ARMS CONTROL NONPROLIFERATION DEDICATED TO PREVENTING THE MISUSE OF BIOLOGY CHEMISTRY. BIOLOGY'S A POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY THAT THE POTENTIAL RIGHT TO GIVE HIM BENEFITS. HOWEVER THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD ALSO ALLOW A MALICIOUS ORRECKLESS ACTOR GREAT THINKERS PATHOGENS SUCH AS SMALLPOX. FROM BEING MADE AT THE ORDER ONLINE. NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD INCLUDING UNITED STATES REQUIRES A COMPANY THAT SELLS THE PRODUCT IN A TO SCREEN THE CUSTOMER'S. ENTERTAINING ORDERS TO ENSURE THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING MATERIAL THAT CAN BE SUBMITTED INTO A DANGEROUS PATHOGENS. A GROUP OF COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE SYNTHETIC DNA HAVE CREATED THE INTERNATIONAL GENE SYNTHESIS CONSORTIUM OR IDEAS SEE. DOES RECORDSMEMBERS DISCRETE ORDERS AND CUSTOMERS TO PREVENT THE MISUSE OF THE PRODUCTS. HOWEVER THESE CUTS THIS GROUP REPRESENTS ONLY ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE COMMERCIAL GENE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY WORLDWIDE. THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPANIES ARE ABLE SOUTH POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS GENETIC MATERIAL TO THE PARISH ACTORS WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT. AB NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WHEN UP CLOSES BY SECURITY GAP BY REQUIRING CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. REQUESTING UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM TO ONLY PURCHASE GENE SYNTHESIS PRODUCTS FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF I JUST. AND EVELYN FIVE SKINNY SCREENING. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ENGAGING CUTTING EDGE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND THEIR LARGE PURCHASERS OF SYNTHETIC DNA GIVING THEM SIGNIFICANT PURCHASING POWER THAT CAN HELP PROMOTE BIO SECURITY. IN THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION THAT CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES MAKE TO THE GROWING BIOECONOMY AB NINETEEN SIXTY THREE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ESTABLISH A DE pFACTO NATIONAL FIVE SECURITY STANDARD PROCESS THAT BIOLOGY. I CAN OTHER ISSUE OFFICIALS SEE AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY COME AT LEADER THE FIELD BY SECURITY. BY BECOMING THE FIRST STATE TO REQUIRE THAT GENE SYNTHESIS COMPANIES WHICH DO BUSINESS WITH PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. DEMONSTRATE THE COMMENDED BY A SECURITY. MISTER SUPPORT AB NINETEEN SIX THREE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S BY SECURITY BY REQUIRING THAT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ONLY PURCHASE SYNTHETIC DNA.

B. NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. CORRECT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FIRST LET ME START BY SAYING THAT ARE WE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND WELL I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE BILL- PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE UCCS USE A COMMUNITY COLLEGES REPORT ON STUDENT OUTCOMES OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON THEIR CAMPUSES. AND HOW MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING IS BEING SPENT- THIS COMES BY WAY OF AN L. A. OVER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS A REPORT. THAT WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S THREE HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS ALLUC'S ALL CSU'S AT LEAST 75% OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES PROVIDE SOME FORM OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON CAMPUS. RECENTLY THE LEGISLATORS SUB SUPPLEMENTED HIGHER EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING SPECIFICALLY AND- THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET FIFTEEN POINT THREE MILLION WAS PROVIDED TO THE UC CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HAVE FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET THE AMOUNT HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY TO SIXTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS- THIS GROWTH IS IN RESPONSE TO THE GROWING CONCERN OVER STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH NATIONWIDE 60% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. FILL THE PANDEMIC MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION AMONG OUR STUDENTS AS INCREASED. ANXIETY HAS INCREASED AND THEIR ACADEMIC- PERFORMANCE HAS. DECREASED THE NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT MENTAL SPENDING IS BEING SPENT AND USE IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE STUDENT WELL BEING. AB NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REQUIRES THE YOU SEE THE CSU AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO SUBMIT A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT BY MARCH FIRST TEACHER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE USE OF FUNDS ALLOCATED FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- WITH THAT I DO HAVE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT I HAVE- MISS JASMINE PRASAD A STUDENT AT FOLSOM LAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT SENATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ONCE AGAIN- THE FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADVOCATING MORE FUNDING TOWARDS MENTAL HEALTH AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND SECOND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS FOR CONTINUING HIS ADVOCACY WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRULY LISTEN TO STUDENTS. MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT A NEW PARTY. IT'S A CONTINUING ISSUE THAT AFFECTS STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY. INCREASE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES DURING THE FIRST YEAR THE PANDEMIC. STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE CONSISTENTLY ASK FOR MORE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING. AND TO HELP DURING THE NEW ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS. ARE UNDER POPULATION OR MOST AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF ACCESSIBILITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC MY ANXIETY AND ADHD HAVE ONLY WORSENED MY PEERS CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME STRUGGLES. AND THEY OFTEN ASK HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED TO ADDRESS THE STRUGGLES. LIKELY I AM THANKFUL TO ATTEND A COLLEGE THAT HAS INCREASED AFFORDABLE RESOURCES TO HELP STUDENTS OBTAIN MENTAL INSTABILITY HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE SAME FOR EVERY CAMPUS. TRANSPARENCY ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE AND STUDENTS TO SEE WHAT SPECIFIC AREAS STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL AS HOW EACH COLLEGE IS WORKING TO ALLOCATE FUNDS APPROPRIATELY. STUDENTS ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN COLLEGES INCREASE THEIR LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN ORDER TO SEE OUR STUDENTS RE ENROLL IN HIGHER EDUCATION WE MUST SHOW NEED BASED DATA. AND FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I THOUGH ON AB NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. THANK YOU. MISTER SALAS YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS- ARE. NOT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ON THE LINE BECAUSE.

MONEY AT THE PROBLEM SO I LOVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK YOU'VE COVERED A LOT OF THOSE REALLY IMPORTANT METRICS WITH YOUR BILL THE ONE THING THAT OF THE EVENTUALLY WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MEASURE IS THE QUALITY OF THE COUNSELING THAT THE STUDENTS ARE. RECEIVING AND HOW YOU MEASURE TRUE OUTCOMES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED A TIMELY MANNER AND- YOU KNOW FOR THAT FOR THAT FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION. OF WHEN THEY NEED HELP THAT CITY IT WOULD BE NICE I THINK AND I MEAN NOT JUST FOR STUDENTS BUT ACROSS THE STATE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW HOW HOW MUCH IS THIS HOW MUCH IS ALL THE SPENDING OR DOING OF REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE THAT'S THAT'S A QUESTION WILL HAVE TO EVENTUALLY CANCER BUT IT'S- I'VE I'VE DEALT PRECIADO BRINGING FORWARD. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT YEAH WE BELIEVE IN ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCREASING THAT ACCOUNTABILITY THAN THE WE LIKE ALL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT EFFICACY AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE BEING TARGETED THE WAY THEY NEED TO SO THAT WE HAVE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE DESIRE.

IN AT AT THE TIME I WAS ALSO WORKING- ON AN HOURLY BASIS I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT THAT THE SAME PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING NOW- WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTORS WHO ARE HAVING TO WORK ON A PART TIME BASIS NOT EQUALLY PAID. WHETHER NOT COMPENSATED FOR OFFICE HOURS NOT COMPENSATED- TO MAKE SURE THE EDUCATION COMPLETE WHEN THEY'RE HELPING STUDENTS NOT COMPENSATED FOR- HELPING TO REVIEW- MATERIAL THAT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED AND OR PREP SO THERE IS A TERRIBLE AND AGREE NOT JUST ON PAPER BUT IN TERMS OF.

THANK YOU SEE WOMEN THANK YOU HAVE A FOR SUPPORTING OUR TOPICS EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK- EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINE PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TOOK A HISTORIC STEP IN PROTECTING AMERICAN WORKERS WHEN HE SIGNED UP BUILDING THAT THEY'RE FAIR PAY ACT THE FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION OF HIS ADMINISTRATION. YOU DON'T LAWS CAN CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE EMPLOYERS UNDERSTAND THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO HAVE THE AWARENESS AND TO TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTION TO CREATE POLICY IN PRACTICE FOR FAIR COMPENSATION. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE HEARING I'M GOING TO USE THE DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINE CHARACTER MAKES TO DEMONSTRATE OUR POINT. YES FABULOUS OF COURSE EITHER. BRAND ABOUT PASSING OR AVOIDED AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THE RELEVANT TIME IN CALCULUS IS INFLECTION POINT. AN INSPECTION POINT PLEASANT POINT ON THE CURVE THAT SEPARATES A CONCAVE UPWARD TROMBA COUNTY SANTA WENT AND VICE VERSA AS DEMONSTRATED ON THE HANDOUT YOU'VE RECEIVED. ALSO THE FOUNDED THE MOMENT CONNECTICUT CHANGE OCCURS OR MAY OCCUR. DOES AT COUNTY CORK. NUMBER DOCUMENT YOU RECEIVED WAS CREATED BASED UPON FROM THE WEBSITE CALLED MATHIS PHONE. SEPARATELY AND DISTINCTLY THIS HANDOUT MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TO A FULL TIME PROFESSIONAL AND A PART TIME PROFESSOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PROGRAM PROFESSOR GETS PAID TO TEACH STUDENTS IN A TWO HOUR LECTURE COURSE EACH WEEK ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THIS PLANT OUT. AND SO DOES A PART TIME PROFESSOR. FULL TIME PROFESSOR GETS PAID FOR THE TIME TO DEVELOP A LESSON PLAN AROUND THAT SENT OUT. A PART TIME PROFESSOR THAT'S NOT. THE FULL TIME PROFESSOR GETS PAID FOR THE TIME YOU TO DEVELOP ACTIVITIES STUDENT WORK AND WORKSHEET. ABSOLUTELY USED TO PRACTICE THE CONTENT ON THE TENT OUT. THAT PART KIND OF PENSIONS GETS PAID FOR THE TIME USED TO GREAT MID TERMS AND FINALS FOR THEIR CALCULUS COURSE. THE PART TIME PROFESSORS THE- PART TIME PROFESSORS WANT EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. TRANSACTION GOING ON UNDERSTANDING A. B. SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO TIMES ON THE DIFFERENCES DEMONSTRATED IN ONE SIMPLE CAPITALIST MUCH. BUT KEEP THE SAME LESSON IN THE SAME COURSE ON THE SAME. TWO DIFFERENT INSTRUCTORS ARE PAID IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. QUITE SIMPLY THAT PAID PRACTICE NEEDS TO SEE. THE TIME HAS COME FOR CALIFORNIA TO MAKE EQUAL PAY A REALITY FOR EDUCATORS IN THE LARGEST POST SECONDARY EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. I'M VERY DISCARDED AS UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY NOTHING. NOTHING COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IN ENSURING ALL WORKERS RECEIVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. NUMBER TWENTY TWO APPLICTION POINT. BROUGH BONTA SAID IT DEPENDS ON PARTICULARLY ACCERN INFLECTION POINTS IN HISTORY. RELATED WITH BIG CHANGES ARE HAPPENING AND EVERYTHING SEEMS UP FOR GRABS. NOW WE ALL HAVE LIVED IN A WORLD THAT HAS GEARED UP FOR GRABS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE SIMPLY WANT EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF MY STATEMENT I'M AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR TEACHING SERVICES AT LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE. UNLIKE THE CALCULUS PROFESSOR THE EXAMPLE. I AM ONLY PAID FOR THE TIME IN THE CLASSROOM PROVIDING DIRECT INSTRUCTION BUT NOT FOR ANY OTHER INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITY SUPPORT AND PROHIBITING THIS PRACTICE. BUT WE DESERVE EQUAL PAGE FOR EQUAL WORK.

UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT A COMMENSURATE- SIGNIFICANT BUDGET INCREASE WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL FIX THE PROBLEM THAT IS THAT FACES OUR INSTITUTIONS TODAY- RIGHT NOW. CALIFORNIA COLLEGES RECEIVE THE LOWEST PER PUPIL FUNDING RATE OF ANY EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE STATE. THAT FORCES HARD CHOICES FOR OUR DISTRICTS TO SATISFY BOTH LOCAL AND DISTRICT PRIORITIES. JUST SOME EXAMPLES FOR YOU- YOU KNOW WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN PAY OR INCREASE IN BUDGET- THIS WOULD FORCE A HARD DECISION ON YOU KNOW INCREASES AND CURRENT FACULTY PAY. HOW TO MEET PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR CURRENT STAFF- OTHER CATEGORICAL THAT DO BENEFIT- PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS IT WOULDN'T CREATE HARD CHOICES ON. PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW IF- STUDENT ENROLLMENT- AND CLOSE EQUITY GAPS- FOR EXAMPLE- FREE TUITION FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS- BASIC NEED FUNDING TO ALLEVIATE FOOD AND HOUSING INSECURITY AND JUST A LOT MORE- THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ALL I THINK AGREE ARE CRITICAL FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND STAFF.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I FORGOTTEN THE INTIMACY OF THIS ROOM SO IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY THREE WHICH WILL REQUIRE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA TAKE ANNUALLY TRAIN THEIR STUDENTS ON SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THE CRISIS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AT OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST UP TO ONE THIRD OF UNDERGRADUATE WOMEN EXPERIENCE NON CONSENSUAL SEXUAL CONTACT. STUDIES ALSO PROVE THAT SURVIVORS OF NON CONSENSUAL SEXUAL CONTACT OFTEN EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL EMOTIONAL ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL CONSEQUENCES. WELL EXISTING LAWS REQUIRE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAMMING. INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO TRAIN THEIR STUDENTS ON THESE TOPICS. WELL SOME INSTITUTIONS HAVE ADOPTED STRONG TRAINING REQUIREMENTS INDEPENDENTLY OTHER CAMPUSES AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT. IN ADDITION MANY TRAININGS FOCUS ON THE PREVENTION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE OR INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT TO DO AFTER AN INCIDENT OCCURS IS NOT A COVERED. LEAVING MANY SURVIVORS TO FEEL LOST ABOUT WHERE TO GO OR WHAT TO DO. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THESE TRAININGS TO NOT ONLY COVER THE TOPIC OF PREVENTION BUT ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND RESOURCES FOR WHAT TO DO AFTER AN INCIDENT OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE OCCURS. BETTER ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND EDUCATION WILL EMPOWER SURVIVORS TO TAKE ACTION INCREASE REPORTING OF INCIDENTS. THROUGH THIS TRAINING AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY THREE ONE SURE THAT THERE IS A BASELINE LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT STUDENTS HAVE REGARDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND pPROTECT THE SAFETY AND SUCCESS OF ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE SONYA DHARMA DIRECTOR OF ORGANIZING FOR CHEN UP COLLEGIATE.

SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN YES THANK YOU AND I PROMISES LAST TIME YOU HEARING FROM YOU TODAY- I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY THINKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL FOR ADVOCATING ON IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT CONTINUE TO RISE WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THAT SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND ASSAULT IS A SERIOUS MATTER. THAT CAUSES LONG TERM EFFECTS TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. 35% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT BY ANOTHER PERSON ON CAMPUS. WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF CLASS ONE OF MY CAMPUSES- CLASSMATES WARNED ME ABOUT A SPECIFIC SPORTS TEAM BECAUSE THEY WERE KNOWN FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. STUDENTS NEED A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE MEANING OF CONSENT AS WELL STOPPING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. AND OR HARASSMENT. 20% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TRANSFERRED TO UC AND THIRTY TWO TRANSFERRED TO A CSU. ESTABLISHING AN ANNUAL TRAINING IN EACH SECTOR ALLOW STUDENTS TO FEEL SAFE NO MATTER WHAT INSTITUTION FOR CAMPUS THEY ATTEND. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE ALWAYS STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. MANY COME BACK YEARS LATER. BECAUSE OF THIS THE STUDENT BODY OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS INTEGRATED THROUGHOUT ALL LEVELS OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE MAKING PROPER EDUCATION ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT. CRITICALLY ARE IMPORTANT. STUDENTS ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP STRENGTHEN TITLE NINE REGULATIONS TO ENSURE CAMPUS SAFETY. MY MANY VICTIMS ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK TO THE DRAMA THEY FACE IN THEIR LIFE. I POLITELY URGENT I THOUGH ON AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY THREE TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND EMPOWER SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT. IN DOING SO WE CAN ESTABLISH STRONGER PROTECTION SECURITY AND SUPPORT FOR OUR STUDENTS THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THE CHAIR. THIS YOUNG IN THIS GOVERNMENT PLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER READY. THANK YOU AT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND OBVIOUSLY- IN STRONG SUPPORT- AS MR- MEDINA IT PREVIOUSLY SAID THE BILL IS SIMPLY RAISING THE CAP ON. THE NUMBER OF HOURS A PART TIME FACULTY CAN WORK- IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM- THERE TOO MANY PART TME FACULTY WHO HAVE TO DRIVE FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT THE DISTRICT TO PIECE TOGETHER A FULL TIME LITTLE RIGHTIES FREEWAY FLYERS. WHO SPEND MORE TIME ON THE FREEWAY THAN THEY CAN A PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES FOR STUDENTS BY RAISING THE CAP OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE PART TIME FACULTY CAN SPEND MORE TIME IN THE CLASSROOM AND MORE TIME PROVIDING THOSE CENTRAL SERVICES. THAN DRIVING FROM ONE DISTRICT TO THE NEXT THIS IS A CRITICAL FOR ENSURING THAT WE'RE PROVIDING AS INADEQUATE SORT OF PART TIME FACULTY WORKS WORKS WHERE ARE YOU A FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS- AND ALSO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FAIRNESS AND EQUITY SO- WITH THAT I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS BILL. AT THE HEAD NO OPPOSITION BUT- WE ARE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR ISSUES AROUND ANY HEALTHCARE COSTS THAT COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL SO YOU COMBINE THAT WITH SORT OF THE COMMONSENSE REFORM THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO.

UNDER THE CURRENT 67% THRESHOLD MANY PART TIME FACULTY MUST AS MICHAEL JUST MENTIONED. TEACHING MULTIPLE DISTRICTS TO TRY TO PUT TOGETHER A FULL OR EVEN GREATER THAN FULL TIME SCHEDULE. THIS LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY IT LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SHARED GOVERNMENTS WERE CONNECTED SENATE. AND BE A RESOURCE TO STUDENTS. AND RURAL DISTRICTS WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO HIRE ENOUGH FACULTY THIS WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW COLLEGES TO OFFER MORE CLASS ACTIONS TO A SINGLE PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO CAN TO ADDRESS SOME MISCONCEPTIONS. BY COMPARISON THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS DO NOT HAVE A CAP IN PART TIME FACULTY HOURS. THIS BILL WOULD THEN ALLOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN. TO OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. THIS BILL ALSO DOES NOT AFFECT THE GRANTING OF TENURE TEN YEARS A PRINCIPLE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS. IT SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO ALL PROFESSORS REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS THEY TEACH. IT ALSO DOESN'T CHANGE THE NUMBER OF CLASSES TAUGHT BY FULL TIME FACULTY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE 7525% LINE ACTED BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. INCREASES THE NUMBER OF SECTIONS-TAUGHT BY FULL TIME FACULTY TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND HAS CREATED AN ARTIFICIAL CEILING WITH THE MANDATE OF A DISTRICTS FULL TIME OBLIGATION NUMBER OR FUND. THE FUND IS MEANT TO BE A FLOOR. OF ORDER MINIMUM NUMBER FACT FULL TIME FACULTY TEACH DISTRICTS. ALTHOUGH EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN A FIFTY SIX DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF FOR MORE FULL TIME FACULTY. IT DOES PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PART TIME FACULTY TO HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THE LIFE OF OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR SUCCESS.

MOVING TO THE LAST ITEM ON OUR AGENDA FILE ITEM FOURTEEN A. B. TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN MR HOLDEN WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. PART. THIS IS YOUR THANK YOU AND MEMBERS OF A BEATS TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN CONTINUES TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF THE COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS OR C. CAP FACT ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHICH FORMALIZES PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AND LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. IT WAS NOT LONG AGO THAT THE ONLY STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS HAD THE HIGHEST GPAS AND SOUGHT OUT THESE PROGRAMS AS ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES DURING THEIR SENIOR YEAR BEFORE HEADING OFF TO COLLEGE. HOWEVER DOING ROMAN IS NOW SEEN BY EDUCATORS RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS AS A CRITICAL PATHWAY TO HELP BROAD RANGE OF STUDENTS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOL. TO POSTSECONDARY CAREERS. TAKING A MOMENT TO REFLECT I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE PROUD OF HOW FAR WE'VE PROGRESSED ON DUAL ENROLLMENT IN THE FACT PAST FEW YEARS WE EVEN HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. UNDERSCORING HOW CRITICAL THESE PROGRAMS ARE MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD LIKE TO EITHER BEGIN OR EXPAND THEIR DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS BUT LACKS THE ABILITY TO DO SO. THESE CHALLENGES RANGE FROM ADMINISTRATIVE LIMITATIONS TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATING DUAL ENROLLMENT AND A COLLEGE WIDE STRATEGY. AB TWENTY SIX SIX TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN SIX TO ADDRESS THOSE LIMITATIONS BY PROVIDING FUNDING FOR NEW C. CAP PROGRAMS AND EFFECTIVE TEMPLATE THE COLLEGES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN USE TO ESTABLISH THEIR PARTNERSHIPS. THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES FUNDING FOR DUAL ENROLLMENT PARTNERSHIPS BASED ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES WHICH WILL INCREASE STUDENT ACCESS AND PROGRAM VISIBILITY. THIS BILL WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING TO COUPLE THESE DUAL ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH ROBUST STUDENT EVER ADVISING BECAUSE IT IS CRITICAL STUDENTS HAVE THE UPROAR CREATE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT THEIR COLLEGE CAREER. ANOTHER CHALLENGE WITH DUAL ENROLLMENT IS THE LOW REPRESENTATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN THESE PROGRAMS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE CONCRETE STEPS TO REACH OUT TO THE STUDENTS SO AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN SPECIFICALLY PROVIDES RESOURCES TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE DAHLE ROMAN OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE UNDERREPRESENTED. IN HIGHER EDUCATION. WE HAVE MET THE CHALLENGE BY ESTABLISHING DUAL ENROLLMENT AS AN EFFECTIVE PATHWAY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. NOMINEE MUST MEET THE NEW CHALLENGE OF BUILDING INTENTION AND TO DEAL IN ROMAN PROGRAMS AND POLICY.
