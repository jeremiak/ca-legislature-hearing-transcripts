FAIRLY NORMAL COURSE OF NORMAL

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:11.739
BUSINESS. THE HISTORY OF IT IS

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:13.308
WHAT I WAS GETTING IN MY

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:14.609
OPENING IS THAT THE OF THE

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:15.577
STATE MADE THIS DECISION

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:18.313
EFFECTIVE CAMPUS SEVEN MILES

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:19.514
ABOUT FOUR MILES OUTSIDE OF

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:21.783
TOWN SEVEN MILES FROM THE MOST

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:25.286
DEAD CENTER- PORTIONS OF TOWN.

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:27.255
AND THEY DID THAT BECAUSE THIS

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:28.823
LAND WAS DONATED BY THE-

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:31.726
BRITISH MISTRUST. AND BY CITING

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:35.563
THE LAND OUT THERE. COMBINED

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.165
WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.566
WENT INTO IN THE MID TWO

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:41.269
THOUSANDS THERE WAS- ESTIMATE

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:43.104
GROWTH TOWARDS THE CAMPUS NO

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:45.139
GROWTH COULD OCCUR AROUND THE

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:47.976
CAMPUS UNTIL THE CITY MEETS AS

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:48.776
I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:50.845
HAVING SERVED- INTO LAUGHTER

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:54.282
POSITION. SO IN ORDER TO

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:58.019
FACILITATE- GROSS NOW TO CREATE

01:25:58.086 --> 01:26:02.490
BOTH A CAMPUS LIFE AND ALSO

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:03.024
ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUE

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:03.558
BECAUSE ONE THING THAT WAS

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:04.425
TOUCHED ON BRIEF IN SOME OF THE

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:05.727
OPPOSITION COMMENTS IS KIND OF

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:07.128
THE FACT ON SOME THE OTHER

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:08.696
COMMUNITY SERVER SIDE. AMBER

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:12.333
SAID AS A 1% VACANCY RATE.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.635
RIGHT THAT LIKE MANY PARTS OF

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:14.936
CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH I THINK

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.337
PEOPLE OFTEN TIMES OVERLOOKED

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.439
US BECAUSE WERE RURAL- AND WERE

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:20.241
SMALL BUT WE'RE FACING THE SAME

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:22.243
HOUSING SHORTAGES IF NOT IN

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:24.345
SOME CASES WORST BECAUSE BEING

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:26.180
A COMMUNITY THAT'S WITHIN. YOU

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.649
KNOW A TWO TO TWO AND A HALF

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:29.918
HOUR DRIVE OF MOST PORTIONS THE

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:32.086
BAY AREA. LIVING IN THE BAY

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.655
AREA HAS BECOME SO

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:35.123
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE FOR

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:37.492
MOST WORKING CALIFORNIANS AS

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:38.493
YOU KNOW THE TAPE. OUT INTO

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.695
MASTER LOS BANOS MERCED CAN

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:41.996
IMPACT OUR HOUSING CRISIS EVEN

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:44.532
WORSE. ON TOP OF THAT WE ADDED

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:45.733
TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AS WELL

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.336
AS A SUPPORT STAFF AND FACULTY.

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:49.304
FOR THOSE TEN THOUSAND

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.573
STUDENTS. AND SO WE'RE REALLY

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:53.708
IN A BREAKING POINT ON HAVING

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:55.476
TO HAVE STUDENT HOUSING TO FREE

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:56.811
UP HOUSING FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.479
THE COMMUNITY. TO ALSO CREATE

01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:00.548
SOME CAMPUS LIFE. IT HAS BEEN

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.216
DIFFICULT OVER THE LAST DECADE

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:05.053
TO EVEN RECRUIT. FACULTY TO THE

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:07.221
CAMPUS COULD YOU BRING FACULTY

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:10.525
THE CAMPUS YOU'VE GOT. A BACK

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:11.926
YOU KNOW SOME CAMPUS LIFE ON A

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:14.829
SMALLER FOOTPRINT BECAUSE THE

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:15.897
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. AND

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:17.899
NOTHING GOING ON AROUND IT

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:19.033
MAYBE MAYBE MORE FIVE MILES

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.735
AWAY REMEMBER GRAY MAYBE I

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.103
DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION THAT I

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:24.639

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:39.320
I'M JUST MISSING THE NEED TO

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:41.623
COME HERE AS OPPOSED TO. LAUGH

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:43.224
GO IN THE BOARD APPROVING IT

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:43.725
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:45.393
UNINCORPORATED AREA IN. A

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.594
RECEIPT THE CITY SHOULD BE THE

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.563
RIGHT. I MEAN I WORK REALLY

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.598
HARD TO ANNEX. UNINCORPORATED

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:52.066

01:27:57.238 --> 01:28:00.508
I'M JUST MISSING THAT PART OF

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:01.776
THE STORY AND I APOLOGIZE THAT.

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:02.710

TAKE A POSITION- SUPPORT OR

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:09.751
OPPOSE. AND I THINK THE ANSWER

01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:11.085
TO SOME OF THE CITY IN THIS TO

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:12.553
BE MY FINAL POINT ON WHY WE ARE

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.189
WHERE WE'RE AT- IS THE POLITICS

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:18.459
OF CITY GOVERNMENT. LAUGH GO.

01:28:18.526 --> 01:28:24.666
AHEAD. THAT ALL TOGETHER AND

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:25.800
SOMETIMES YOU GET INACTION.

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.468
WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY STEPPED

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.270
IN. AT THE STATE LEVEL SAID

01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:31.139
WELL IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:33.341
COLLECTIVE INTEREST TO HAVE THE

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:34.609
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:36.144
THE STATE INVESTMENT MADE BY.

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:38.713
OUR INSTITUTION. ANNEXED INTO

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.448
THE CITY THE GROWTH THAT OCCURS

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:42.417
THEN AROUND IT FOLLOWING THE

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.852
RULES AND PROCEDURES OF.

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:47.655
LAUGHTER AND LOCAL ORDINANCES-

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:49.023

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.191
WE CAN WORK THROUGH THOSE

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:51.626
POLITICS BUT WE WORK. BASICALLY

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:54.862
HAMSTRUNG- IN MOVING FORWARD-

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:57.031
IS DIFFERENT YOU KNOW ENTITIES

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.100
HAD DIFFERENT OPINIONS FOR.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.468
SOME POLICY AND PROBABLY SOME

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:01.969
POLITICAL REASONS RIGHT SO THIS

01:29:02.036 --> 01:29:04.906
IS MY WAY OF SERVING- YOU KNOW

01:29:04.972 --> 01:29:06.340
THE STATE'S INTEREST AS WELL AS

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:07.408
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INTERESTING

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:10.278
KIND OF. SPURRING THAT ACTIVITY

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:12.313
TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU'RE SHOWING

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.815
LEADERSHIP ON ON A MAJOR

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:17.418
CONCERN. SO WHAT I'M MISSING AT

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:22.557
ALL IN WITH THIS QUESTION. IS

01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:23.858
AFTER THIS A PER ON THIS FLOOR

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:25.326
AND GOES TO THE GOV IS THE

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:26.260
GOVERNOR TO GET ALL A LETTER

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:29.097
AND MAY EVEN A THREAT OF LET.

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:31.165
FROM THE CITY OR FROM THE

01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:34.035
UNIVERSITY AND SAYING THIS THIS

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:36.804
IS NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER AND

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:37.939
THEY JUST KIND OF. THOUGHT

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:40.174
