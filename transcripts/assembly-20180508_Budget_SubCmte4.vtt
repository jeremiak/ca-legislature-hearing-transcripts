00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:14.960 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR WAS A TWENTY ERCENT

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:16.495 region:rollup2
INCREASE. WE WILL KNOW LATER

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.363 region:rollup2
THIS MONTH AND WE'RE HOPEFUL

00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:21.300 region:rollup2
THAT IT WON'T BE AS HIGH BUT WE

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:22.868 region:rollup2
ARE ACCEPTING THAT THERE WILL BE

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.270 region:rollup2
AGAIN MORE INCREASE.

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:26.872 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO MEET THESE

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.574 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND TO MEET THIS

00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:31.610 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:33.579 region:rollup2
AND IT IS IT'S A CRISES.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.147 region:rollup2
WHAT I'VE HEARD WE'VE TALKED

00:28:33.579 --> 00:28:35.981 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST

00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:37.449 region:rollup2
THAT?

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:40.719 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S IT'S NOT AN

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:42.487 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE IN ITS NOT A FIRE I

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:45.090 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A DISASTER.

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:48.226 region:rollup2
BUT I TRULY BEG TO DIFFER AND I

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:49.928 region:rollup2
THINK FOR EACH OF YOU AS YOU

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:51.830 region:rollup2
MOVE ABOUT.

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:54.333 region:rollup2
STEP OVER PEOPLE TO GET WHERE

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:57.102 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO GO THAT IT'S BECOME

00:28:54.333 --> 00:29:00.072 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S IN THE CITY IT.

00:28:57.102 --> 00:29:02.207 region:rollup2
HAS BECOME AMOST NORMAL BECAUSE

00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:03.809 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CANNOT SAFELY SLEEP AT

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:05.310 region:rollup2
NIGHT THEY SLEEP IN THE DAY IN

00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:07.212 region:rollup2
THEIR TENTS.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.647 region:rollup2
ON THE STREET IN THE BUSINESS TO

00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:10.215 region:rollup2
OUR.

00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:11.149 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE BUSINESS I SEE JEFF

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:12.584 region:rollup2
NODDING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:15.887 region:rollup2
MARKET ST.

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:17.489 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S NOT UNUSUAL AT ALL TO

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:19.124 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO THROUGH OUR AROUND

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:20.459 region:rollup2
THE TENT IN ORDER TO. EVEN

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:22.794 region:rollup2
CONDUCT BUSINESS

00:29:20.459 --> 00:29:25.364 region:rollup2
BUT MORE THAN THAT.

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:27.733 region:rollup2
IN AS WAS SAID US.

00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:29.901 region:rollup2
DATE THAT HAS

00:29:27.733 --> 00:29:31.937 region:rollup2
NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:35.440 region:rollup2
THE WORLD.

00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:37.009 region:rollup2
THERE. IS SUCH A NEED.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.944 region:rollup2
AND.

00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:41.647 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES

00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:43.382 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IMMEDIATELY.

00:29:41.647 --> 00:29:45.183 region:rollup2
WE'VE HOUSE THIRTY THOUSAND

00:29:43.382 --> 00:29:45.951 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OVER TIME

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:47.586 region:rollup2
MUCH THERE'S.

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:49.321 region:rollup2
.

00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:50.689 region:rollup2
I COULD GO INTO THE LITANY OF

00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:52.190 region:rollup2
EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND

00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:54.793 region:rollup2
I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO SO IF YOU

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.861 region:rollup2
LIKE. BUT THE POINT IS THAT. NO

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:57.663 region:rollup2
ONE

00:29:55.861 --> 00:29:59.698 region:rollup2
AND NO SYSTEM.

00:29:57.663 --> 00:30:03.201 region:rollup2
IN THIS STATE.

00:29:59.698 --> 00:30:04.836 region:rollup2
PREPARED FOR THE PERFECT STORM

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:07.039 region:rollup2
THAT CREATES THE INFLOW INTO

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:07.439 region:rollup2
HOPELESSNESS.

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:10.208 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE THE

00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:12.177 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY?

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:15.147 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WORK EVERYDAY BUT

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:16.748 region:rollup2
CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE. AND I

00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:18.350 region:rollup2
THINK IN LOS ANGELES NOW A ONE

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:20.185 region:rollup2
BEDROOM APARTMENT IS TWENTY FOUR

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.521 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND THAT

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:24.122 region:rollup2
IS NOT HIGH END THAT'S JUST

00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:25.390 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO. LIVE IN A

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:27.392 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:29.761 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:30.896 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE IN ADDITION TO THAT THE

00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:33.131 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE.

00:30:30.896 --> 00:30:36.201 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF.

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:37.436 region:rollup2
PROP FORTY SEVEN THE NUMBER OF

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:39.304 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THERE WAS A RECENT

00:30:37.436 --> 00:30:41.673 region:rollup2
STUDY THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:43.608 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD CONTACT.

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:45.844 region:rollup2
WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:47.512 region:rollup2
IN THIS COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IS

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:50.449 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO SIXTY FIVE.

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:52.417 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND AS A RESULT

00:30:50.449 --> 00:30:53.418 region:rollup2
SO MANY OF THE BARRIERS THAT

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:55.854 region:rollup2
PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:57.689 region:rollup2
HOUSING AND

00:30:55.854 --> 00:31:00.826 region:rollup2
CLAIM AT. ALL OF THOSE FOLD INTO

00:30:57.689 --> 00:31:02.427 region:rollup2
WHY WE NEED FLEXIBLE DOLLARS TO

00:31:00.826 --> 00:31:04.830 region:rollup2
ADDRESS PREVENTION.

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:07.632 region:rollup2
WE NEED FLEXIBLE DOLLARS TO BE

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:09.768 region:rollup2
ABLE TO LOOK AT.

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:11.970 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO BUILDING HOUSING

00:31:09.768 --> 00:31:13.972 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT EXISTING STRUCTURES

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.441 region:rollup2
AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:18.009 region:rollup2
TO RENOVATE TO NOT HAVE IT BE A

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:19.344 region:rollup2
HALF MILLION DOLLARS A UNIT IN

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:22.547 region:rollup2
THREE TO FIVE YEARS DOWN THE

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:24.883 region:rollup2
LINE. BUT TO REALLY MOVE PEOPLE.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:27.152 region:rollup2
OFF THE STREETS.

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:29.621 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND AND I TOTALLY AGREE

00:31:27.152 --> 00:31:31.156 region:rollup2
AND SO DOES THE MAYOR THAT THE

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:32.958 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICE IS PERMANENT

00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:34.292 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:36.027 region:rollup2
AND THE BEST PRACTICE FOR

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:37.462 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS.

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:39.297 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IS PERMANENT

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:42.801 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:44.102 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME.

00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:47.906 region:rollup2
AND I REPEAT THAT IN THE

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:50.742 region:rollup2
MEANTIME WE HAVE PEOPLE.

00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:53.178 region:rollup2
THE BARELY EXISTE.

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:55.580 region:rollup2
LIVING WITHOUT.

00:31:53.178 --> 00:31:56.915 region:rollup2
HI BASIC HYGIENE.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.417 region:rollup2
LIVING WITHOUT.

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:01.553 region:rollup2
WATER

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:04.890 region:rollup2
LIVING WITHOUT.

00:32:01.553 --> 00:32:06.858 region:rollup2
BOB THE ABILITY TO EVEN CARE FOR

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:09.728 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIES OR

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:11.630 region:rollup2
EVEN BE IN A POSITION TO GO. FOR

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:12.731 region:rollup2
TRAINING OR EMPLOYMENT

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.699 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE LIVING ON THE

00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:17.302 region:rollup2
STREET.

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:18.970 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY AND I

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:20.438 region:rollup2
REALLY BESEECH YOU TO THINK

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:23.675 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:26.344 region:rollup2
THIS AS THE CRISIS TO RESPOND TO

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:29.247 region:rollup2
IT AS WE WOULD A HURRICANE AS WE

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:31.183 region:rollup2
WOULD AN EARTHQUAKE AS WE WOULD.

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:34.019 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER NATURAL DISASTER

00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:36.254 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS A DISASTER.

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:37.789 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE RESULT OF ANY NUMBER

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:40.458 region:rollup2
OF CHOICES THAT HAVE COME

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:43.128 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN OUR SYSTEM.

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:46.398 region:rollup2
AND IN OUR CITIES

00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:48.800 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE IF WE HAD FUNDING

00:32:46.398 --> 00:32:50.735 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO STABILIZE

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.570 region:rollup2
TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS TO

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:54.339 region:rollup2
BE ABLE. TO.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:56.541 region:rollup2
.

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:57.809 region:rollup2
MOVE THE ENCAMPMENTS.

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:59.211 region:rollup2
IN A WAY WOULD THEN YOU COULD

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.112 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:03.381 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO MUCH MORE

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:06.418 region:rollup2
SYSTEMATICALLY.

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:08.520 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT IT IT

00:33:06.418 --> 00:33:10.188 region:rollup2
WOULD GIVE AND IT REQUIRES AN

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.057 region:rollup2
INFLUX OF RESOURCES

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:14.993 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AYE WHETHER IT IS

00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:17.662 region:rollup2

ANGELES OR SAN JOSE.

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:22.167 region:rollup2
IT IS CRIPPLING.

00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:23.835 region:rollup2
AND REALLY UNDERMINING.

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:25.303 region:rollup2
OUR NEW STATUS.

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:27.639 region:rollup2

INTERVENED WITHIN AN ASSERTIVE

00:34:56.294 --> 00:35:00.398 region:rollup2
AND CONSISTENT WAY.

00:34:57.963 --> 00:35:01.600 region:rollup2
TO BUILD THE TRUST THAT ALLOWS

THROUGH THE COUNTY PROPOSITION

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:15.513 region:rollup2
SIXTY THREE THE MEASURE I

WRAPAROUND SERVICES.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.690 region:rollup2
WHAT WE AND WE ARE WORKING HARD

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:27.525 region:rollup2
TOWARD BUILDING AN INVENTORY OF

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:29.427 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:30.095 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON EFFICIENCY HOMES?

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:32.664 region:rollup2
AND.

00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:34.232 region:rollup2
A AND AS MANY RENTAL UNITS AS

WE CAN BILL.

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:38.003 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:35:36.034 --> 00:35:40.672 region:rollup2
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WITHOUT

00:35:38.003 --> 00:35:42.607 region:rollup2

00:35:40.672 --> 00:35:44.275 region:rollup2

00:35:45.744 --> 00:35:49.014 region:rollup2
YOU NEVER GET PEOPLE

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:49.547 region:rollup2
FROM THE RIVER BANKS FOR THE

00:35:49.014 --> 00:35:52.317 region:rollup2

00:35:52.317 --> 00:35:55.787 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR.

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:56.721 region:rollup2
AND I MIGHT SAY THAT WALL THE

00:35:55.787 --> 00:35:58.857 region:rollup2

00:36:02.961 --> 00:36:07.732 region:rollup2

FIVE OF STATE FUNDING FOR.

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:12.103 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR CITIES TO

00:36:10.402 --> 00:36:13.438 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY WERE

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:14.906 region:rollup2

OUR COUNTY PARTNERS.

00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:19.444 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT.

00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:22.047 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:22.814 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT EITHER OR.

00:36:22.047 --> 00:36:24.682 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT.

00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:26.551 region:rollup2
WERE WERE MUCH BETTER OFF

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:28.219 region:rollup2

ADDRESS THIS CRISIS.

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:36.594 region:rollup2
BUT OUR PIECE OF IT WHICH WE

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:38.997 region:rollup2

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:41.032 region:rollup2

00:40:29.227 --> 00:40:33.231 region:rollup2
COMING IN AND OUT OF OUR CITY

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:34.799 region:rollup2
ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

00:40:33.231 --> 00:40:35.500 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY CISCO'S INVESTED I

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:37.235 region:rollup2
THINK WELL.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.503 region:rollup2
IN THIS ISSUE I MET DEPARTMENTS

00:40:37.235 --> 00:40:39.837 region:rollup2
BUDGET IS APPROXIMATELY TWO

00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:40.772 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:42.640 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:43.775 region:rollup2
AB JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.510 region:rollup2
MILLION OF THAT COMES FROM

00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:47.745 region:rollup2
COUNTY FUNDS.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:49.514 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A MORE PERMANENT

00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:50.515 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PRATAPADITYA

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:52.583 region:rollup2
THAN ANY OTHER CITY.

00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:53.518 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES OUT AND

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:55.053 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY

00:40:53.518 --> 00:40:56.821 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT OF THE BAY AREA'S

00:40:55.053 --> 00:40:58.456 region:rollup2
HOMELESS POPULATION WITH ABOUT A

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:59.857 region:rollup2
THIRD OF THE BAY AREA SHELTERS.

00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:01.693 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE ABOUT ALMOST FIFTY

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:02.527 region:rollup2
OR FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE

00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:04.295 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:07.065 region:rollup2
.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:08.166 region:rollup2
SO I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT.

00:41:07.065 --> 00:41:09.968 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICALLY WHAT WOULD WE DO

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:11.369 region:rollup2
WITH A INCREASED INVESTMENTS

00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:13.371 region:rollup2
FROM THE STATE ON A ONE TIME

00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:14.372 region:rollup2
BASIS AND I I APPRECIATE.

00:41:13.371 --> 00:41:16.074 region:rollup2
HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

00:41:14.372 --> 00:41:17.675 region:rollup2
THIS DISCUSSION AND I THINK THE

00:41:16.074 --> 00:41:19.477 region:rollup2
IDEA OF HAVING A FLEXIBLE PART

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:20.979 region:rollup2
OF FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:23.281 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DETERMINE

00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:25.049 region:rollup2
HOW TO USE A. IS VERY MUCH

00:41:23.281 --> 00:41:27.485 region:rollup2
NEEDED UP BY THE STATE.

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:28.986 region:rollup2
WE IN IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE WE

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:30.755 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SAY THIRTY MILLION

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:31.990 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:41:30.755 --> 00:41:33.524 region:rollup2
THAT WAS JUST ONE TIME.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.325 region:rollup2
WE COULD PREVENT A THOUSAND

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:35.960 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:38.463 region:rollup2
FROM BECOMING HOMELESS.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.698 region:rollup2
WE COULD HELP FIVE HUNDRED

00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:42.533 region:rollup2
PEOPLE UP PERMANENTLY EXIT

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:44.302 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS ARE THROUGH OUR

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:46.104 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY RENT SUBSIDY PROGRAM

00:41:44.302 --> 00:41:47.105 region:rollup2
CALLED RAPID RE HOUSING. AND WE

00:41:46.104 --> 00:41:48.406 region:rollup2
CAN PROVIDE SHELTER TO

00:41:47.105 --> 00:41:49.807 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED TO

00:41:48.406 --> 00:41:51.008 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE A YEAR.

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:52.677 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:54.345 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL

00:41:52.677 --> 00:41:54.746 region:rollup2
SHELTER FACILITIES WHICH WE WE

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:56.848 region:rollup2
DESPERATELY NEED.

00:41:54.746 --> 00:41:58.349 region:rollup2
.

00:41:56.848 --> 00:42:00.318 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.852 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT YOU DON'T.

00:42:00.318 --> 00:42:01.886 region:rollup2
ALL OF OUR CITIES ARE IN

00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:03.221 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PLACES.

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:04.522 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR

00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:05.990 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE.

00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:07.625 region:rollup2
AGAIN CENTER CISCO DOES HAVE

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.360 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT OF PERMANENT

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:11.162 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BUT WE HOUSE

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.563 region:rollup2
WE HELP FIFTY PEOPLE EVERY WEEK

00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:14.265 region:rollup2
EXIT HOMELESSNESS WHICH I'M

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:16.167 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY PROUD OF AND GRATEFUL

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:18.169 region:rollup2
FOR. A CITY THAT DOES SUCH

00:42:16.167 --> 00:42:19.537 region:rollup2
AMAZING WORK BUT EVERY WEEK.

00:42:18.169 --> 00:42:21.739 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:23.908 region:rollup2
FIFTY NEWLY HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:24.942 region:rollup2
IN SAN FRANCISCO SO WE KEEP

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:26.244 region:rollup2
RUNNING ON THAT.

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.778 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE KEEP OPERATING THE

00:42:26.244 --> 00:42:28.546 region:rollup2
SAME WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING

00:42:26.778 --> 00:42:30.481 region:rollup2
BUSINESS ON WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:32.550 region:rollup2
GET THE JOB DONE. SO I THINK

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:34.519 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.053 region:rollup2
TO USE THESE FUNDS TO FOCUS ON

00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:39.157 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND DIVERSION.

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:40.425 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS ON ADDRESSING

00:42:39.157 --> 00:42:42.193 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY SHELTER NEEDS.

00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:43.694 region:rollup2
AND TO FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE

00:42:42.193 --> 00:42:44.962 region:rollup2
RAPID RE HOUSING WHICH USE THE

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:46.931 region:rollup2
PRIVATE MARKET IN ORDER TO HELP

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:48.332 region:rollup2
HOMELESS PEOPLE FIND A PLACE TO

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:50.301 region:rollup2
LIVE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:51.202 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS. AND I KNOW THAT THE

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.070 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTION.

00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:53.337 region:rollup2
THAT SOME OF YOUR PROBABLY

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.839 region:rollup2
ASKING IT'S WE JUST KEEP

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:56.507 region:rollup2
THROWING MONEY AT THE PROBLEM.

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:58.443 region:rollup2
IS IT CAN GET BETTER.

00:42:56.507 --> 00:43:00.344 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO

00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:01.379 region:rollup2
GET BETTER BY THINK WE KNOW? YOU

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:03.815 region:rollup2
KNOW A LOT OF THINGS.

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:05.049 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IT

00:43:03.815 --> 00:43:06.184 region:rollup2
CRAFTING CREASED INVESTMENTS

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:07.718 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE AN IMPACT SOME OF ITS

00:43:06.184 --> 00:43:09.253 region:rollup2
SORT OF COUNTER FACTUAL LIKE WE

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:11.289 region:rollup2
KNOW THE FACT THAT. THE HUD

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:12.990 region:rollup2
BUDGET CUTS BUDGET AUTHORITY IS

00:43:11.289 --> 00:43:14.091 region:rollup2
A TWENTY PERCENT OF WHAT IT WAS

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.393 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:17.095 region:rollup2
CURRENT DOLLARS AND THAT

00:43:15.393 --> 00:43:18.796 region:rollup2
CORRESPONDS DIRECTLY TO THE RISE

00:43:17.095 --> 00:43:20.264 region:rollup2
OF MODERN DAY HOMELESSNESS IN

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:21.332 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES.

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:22.733 region:rollup2
BUT WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:24.001 region:rollup2
ALL DECREASE IN FUNDING FOR

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.970 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:27.505 region:rollup2
STARTING IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:29.006 region:rollup2
AND EIGHT AND THAT WE KNOW

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:30.608 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME WHERE WE HAD

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:32.443 region:rollup2
SEEN A DECREASE IN HOMELESSNESS.

00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:34.145 region:rollup2
FOOT FOR QUITE SOMETIME IN THE

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:36.781 region:rollup2
STATE AYE THAT SEEM TO HAVE LED

00:43:34.145 --> 00:43:38.282 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO A AN INCREASE AYE IN

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:39.083 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK OUR BUT

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:40.651 region:rollup2
OUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN THOSE ARE

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:43.020 region:rollup2
SORT OF A. COUNTER FACTUAL THING

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:43.254 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE POSITIVE I IMPACTS I

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.323 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:43:43.254 --> 00:43:47.091 region:rollup2
CAN BE SEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:48.993 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE A RECENTLY

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:50.862 region:rollup2
INCREASED OUR INVESTMENTS UNDER

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:51.696 region:rollup2
THE LEADERSHIP OF MERRILY. AND

00:43:50.862 --> 00:43:53.331 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOTHING TO WRITE

00:43:51.696 --> 00:43:55.199 region:rollup2
HOME ABOUT AYE WE SAW A ONE

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:56.300 region:rollup2
PERCENT DECREASE IN HOMELESSNESS

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:57.034 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.503 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

00:43:57.034 --> 00:44:00.538 region:rollup2
BUCKING THE TRENDS OF ALMOST

00:43:58.503 --> 00:44:01.572 region:rollup2
EVERY CITY ON THE WEST COAST AND

00:44:00.538 --> 00:44:03.007 region:rollup2
ALL THAT MOST EVERY CITY

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:04.542 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY AND CERTAINLY.

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:06.410 region:rollup2
BUCKING THE TRENDS AYE IN

00:44:04.542 --> 00:44:08.279 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND WHEN WE DUG DEEP

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:09.447 region:rollup2
INTO WHY THAT HAPPENED. OUT WE

00:44:08.279 --> 00:44:10.882 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT WORD WE INVEST IN WHAT

00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:11.949 region:rollup2
WERE THE OUTCOME SO WE FOUND

00:44:10.882 --> 00:44:13.818 region:rollup2
THAT THE AREAS WHERE WE

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:14.519 region:rollup2
INCREASED OUR INVESTMENTS AND

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:15.953 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HOMELESSNESS.

00:44:14.519 --> 00:44:17.188 region:rollup2
I IN FAMILY HOMELESSNESS AND

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:19.190 region:rollup2
VETERANS HOMELESSNESS SAW SOME

00:44:17.188 --> 00:44:20.691 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD I IMPACTS WE SOLVE

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.792 region:rollup2
OF BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:23.928 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO THIRTY

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:25.196 region:rollup2
PERCENT REDUCTION. AYE IN

00:44:23.928 --> 00:44:27.131 region:rollup2
CHRONIC VETERANS HOMELESSNESS WE

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:28.232 region:rollup2

IN YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IN A

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:31.502 region:rollup2
TWELVE PERCENT REDUCTION IN

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.970 region:rollup2
FAMILY HOMELESSNESS DUE TO THESE

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:34.338 region:rollup2
INCREASED INVESTMENTS AYE THAT

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.807 region:rollup2
WERE MADE. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:38.175 region:rollup2
OF MERRILY AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:40.144 region:rollup2
SIDE NATIONALLY.

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:41.212 region:rollup2

OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT WHEN

00:44:42.547 --> 00:44:46.951 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE SMART. TARGETED

00:44:44.649 --> 00:44:47.852 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS BASED ON AYE DATA

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:49.820 region:rollup2
AND BASED ON WHAT THE COMMUNITY

00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:51.923 region:rollup2
HAS IDENTIFIED BY ITS NEEDS TO

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.057 region:rollup2
BE A WE CAN WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS

00:44:51.923 --> 00:44:54.525 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE IN

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:56.193 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AND I'M I'M

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:57.428 region:rollup2

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

00:44:58.896 --> 00:45:01.566 region:rollup2

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:03.134 region:rollup2
STEINBERG IN YOUR TESTIMONY

00:45:01.566 --> 00:45:06.938 region:rollup2
MENTIONED FLEXIBILITY. NAM WAS

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:09.040 region:rollup2
THAT MEAN.

00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:11.175 region:rollup2
WELL FIRST OF ALL ANY PUBLIC

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.843 region:rollup2
MONEY OF COURSE NEEDS TO COME

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:14.512 region:rollup2
WITH A OUTCOME BASED

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:16.380 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO WE WOULD

00:45:14.512 --> 00:45:18.616 region:rollup2
EXPECT.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.151 region:rollup2
UPON RECEIPT OF THESE RESOURCES

00:45:18.616 --> 00:45:22.520 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE.

00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:25.423 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE USING THE

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.458 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY HELP GET.

00:45:25.423 --> 00:45:28.960 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OFF THE STREET.

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:31.229 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN I WENT WHAT WE MEAN BY

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.297 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IS THE ABILITY TO

00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:36.267 region:rollup2
USE THE MONEY.

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:38.369 region:rollup2
FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT

00:45:36.267 --> 00:45:41.038 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BRIDGE BETWEEN.

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:43.007 region:rollup2
THE OUT REACH.

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:43.841 region:rollup2
THE INTERVENTION.

00:45:43.007 --> 00:45:45.509 region:rollup2

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:54.478 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS BUT WE HAVE A AND

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.647 region:rollup2
THE MOST INTENSE HOMELESSNESS

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:58.916 region:rollup2
CRISIS REALLY IN OUR STATES.

00:46:56.647 --> 00:47:00.685 region:rollup2

IS A CO AUTHOR OF AB THIRTY ONE

00:47:00.685 --> 00:47:03.854 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE I VERY MUCH SUPPORT

TALKING ABOUT IN FACT I MIGHT

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:07.224 region:rollup2
SUGGEST.

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:09.026 region:rollup2
SINCE THE SENATE HAS A TWO

00:47:07.224 --> 00:47:10.261 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL I THINK

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:11.495 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY SHOULD HAVE A TWO

00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:13.297 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL I HAVE

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:15.232 region:rollup2
SOME THOUGHTS ON. A WHERE ELSE

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:16.767 region:rollup2
WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT SPENT

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:18.302 region:rollup2
SPENDING MONEY IN THIS AREA.

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:18.836 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID I I THINK THAT

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:19.637 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION I'M REALLY

00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:21.605 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN.

00:47:19.637 --> 00:47:23.741 region:rollup2
TO GET TO THE CHAIRS QUESTION

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:24.341 region:rollup2
IS IS HOW THIS MONEY IS GOING TO

00:47:23.741 --> 00:47:25.376 region:rollup2
BE USED IN AND LET ME SAY THE

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.677 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING.

00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:28.646 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST NOW SPEAKING FOR

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:29.647 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO WE SPEND ABOUT

00:47:28.646 --> 00:47:31.449 region:rollup2
OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION A

00:47:29.647 --> 00:47:32.983 region:rollup2
YEAR ON HOMELESSNESS WE'VE BEEN

00:47:31.449 --> 00:47:33.718 region:rollup2
SPENDING AT THAT LEVEL CORRECTED

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:35.052 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:47:33.718 --> 00:47:36.787 region:rollup2
INFLATION OVER TIME FOR FOR

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:40.725 region:rollup2
QUITE SOME TIME

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:40.725 region:rollup2
AND THROUGH SEVEN MAYORS WE HAVE

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:43.627 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DROP IN HOMELESSNESS

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.895 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE ONE PERCENT DROP

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:46.397 region:rollup2
THAT WE JUST HEARD. THAT WAS

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.398 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HEROIC DROP COMPARED TO

00:47:46.397 --> 00:47:48.899 region:rollup2
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS

00:47:47.398 --> 00:47:50.801 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:52.603 region:rollup2
SO JUST ARE SITTING ALONE WE

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:53.971 region:rollup2
SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:56.774 region:rollup2
AND YET WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:57.141 region:rollup2
BRING HOMELESSNESS DOWN AND SO.

00:47:56.774 --> 00:47:58.743 region:rollup2
I THINK FOR ME.

00:47:57.141 --> 00:48:00.244 region:rollup2
.

00:47:58.743 --> 00:48:02.713 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:03.881 region:rollup2
ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED FACT BASED

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:05.349 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TO HOMELESSNESS I

00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:08.652 region:rollup2
KNOW ALL THREE OF YOU KNOW.

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:10.955 region:rollup2
THE FIRST I HOUSING FIRST MODEL

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:12.957 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF PERMITS

00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:15.092 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND.

00:48:12.957 --> 00:48:16.160 region:rollup2
AND A DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:18.129 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT FOR

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.663 region:rollup2
CIVIL DOLLARS MEAN.

00:48:18.129 --> 00:48:22.633 region:rollup2
IN A SOMEWHAT AT THIS MOMENT A

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:24.068 region:rollup2
BIT UNDEFINED WAY VERSES WANTING

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:25.202 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS ON.

00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:26.937 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND LET ME

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:28.038 region:rollup2
SAY JUST TO BE CLEAR WHEN I

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:29.306 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:30.941 region:rollup2
I'M NOT NECESSARILY SAYING WE

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:32.777 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BUILD AND CONSTRUCT WITH

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:34.745 region:rollup2
THESE DOLLARS. BUT I THINK PAIN

00:48:32.777 --> 00:48:36.514 region:rollup2
FOR OPERATING COSTS FOR THE

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:37.848 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT RUN THIS LONG

00:48:36.514 --> 00:48:39.350 region:rollup2
TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE THESE ARE

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:40.684 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:42.386 region:rollup2
OVER TIME. TO ADDRESS

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:44.488 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS AND AND I'VE NO

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:46.624 region:rollup2
DOUBT THAT WHAT I'M ALSO HEARING

OF OTHER FLEXIBLE. SOLUTIONS

00:48:46.624 --> 00:48:50.594 region:rollup2
WILL ALSO HELP BUT.

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:53.097 region:rollup2

IT GIVES YOU A SENSE. OF THE

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:58.455 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WE'D LIKE TO TAKE.

00:50:57.221 --> 00:51:00.691 region:rollup2

NOT BEING AS HIGH AND IN THE

00:51:22.246 --> 00:51:26.183 region:rollup2
PAST WHICH CREATES THAT GAP

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:28.953 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE EXPECTATION OF THE

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:30.621 region:rollup2
FINANCING SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT

00:51:28.953 --> 00:51:32.156 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE ABLE TO PUT. FIFTY

00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:33.524 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS AND ANTICIPATING

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:35.693 region:rollup2
THE GAPS THAT WILL COME UP

00:51:33.524 --> 00:51:37.494 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT CHANGE THAT WE'D

00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:38.595 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO ADD ANOTHER TWO

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:40.597 region:rollup2

OUR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:47.738 region:rollup2
MILLION THOUGH THE LION SHARE OF

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:49.440 region:rollup2
IT WOULD GO TO TEMPORARY LEGAL

00:51:47.738 --> 00:51:50.374 region:rollup2
ACTION CAN ASK WERE QUICKER

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.876 region:rollup2

00:51:55.379 --> 00:51:56.680 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:51:55.946 --> 00:52:00.117 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:02.419 region:rollup2
REMODELING SOMETHING OR JUST.

00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:04.822 region:rollup2

00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:06.624 region:rollup2
UNITS WERE TALKING.

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:08.759 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FILLING GAPS

00:52:06.624 --> 00:52:09.827 region:rollup2
FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION THAT'S WHAT

00:52:08.759 --> 00:52:11.028 region:rollup2
I ASSUME FOR ONE LETTER THE

00:52:09.827 --> 00:52:12.196 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION WOULD BE FOR THAT

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:13.931 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:52:12.196 --> 00:52:16.700 region:rollup2
I TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVENTY

00:52:13.931 --> 00:52:18.535 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION WAS IDENTIFIED FOR.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.771 region:rollup2

BUT NO BUT BRIDGE HOUSING IN.

00:52:27.411 --> 00:52:31.582 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD ADD FOUR

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:33.717 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

00:52:31.582 --> 00:52:35.986 region:rollup2

PROBLEM NOT GET ANY BETTER.

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:20.023 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:21.792 region:rollup2
ANSWER AT LEAST PARTLY LIES IN

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:24.461 region:rollup2

TO SOME STATE RESOURCES ON THE

00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:27.397 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND EARLY

00:54:25.496 --> 00:54:29.633 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION SIDE.

00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:31.735 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS THE PIPE THAT THE

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:33.570 region:rollup2

MOM.

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:40.477 region:rollup2
THIS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAVE IS

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:42.679 region:rollup2
ONE BROKEN DOWN CAR.

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:44.448 region:rollup2
ONE RENT INCREASE

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:46.683 region:rollup2
ONE LOST JOB.

00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:48.152 region:rollup2
ONE INJURY.

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:50.621 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM GOING FROM BEING

00:54:48.152 --> 00:54:53.257 region:rollup2
HOUSED.

00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:55.459 region:rollup2
TO COUCH SURFING.

00:54:53.257 --> 00:54:57.227 region:rollup2
TO.

00:54:55.459 --> 00:54:59.830 region:rollup2
OVERCROWDED SHELTER.

00:54:57.227 --> 00:55:02.065 region:rollup2
TO THE STREET.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:03.667 region:rollup2
AND OF WE HAD SOME FLEXIBILITY

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:06.003 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY WITH THE RIGHT

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:07.771 region:rollup2
SORTS OF VERIFICATION TO.

00:55:06.003 --> 00:55:09.740 region:rollup2
PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM.

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:11.742 region:rollup2
BECOMING.

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.877 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT NEW COHORT.

00:55:11.742 --> 00:55:15.312 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:15.879 region:rollup2
TO SHOW A GREATER THAN ONE

00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:17.915 region:rollup2
PERCENT NET DECREASE IN OUR

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:20.184 region:rollup2
CITY.

00:55:17.915 --> 00:55:20.984 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL NUMBERS

00:55:20.184 --> 00:55:25.489 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT IN

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:27.090 region:rollup2
TIME COUNT.

00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:29.092 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR US SAW

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:30.827 region:rollup2
OUR QUESTION ABOUT S. B. THREE

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:32.362 region:rollup2
LOW WHICH WE APPROVED LAST YEAR

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:34.598 region:rollup2
THAT. IS GOING TO PUT A FOUR

00:55:32.362 --> 00:55:37.000 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR BOND TO ADDRESS.

00:55:34.598 --> 00:55:38.435 region:rollup2
ALMOST AS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.770 region:rollup2
IN FRONT OF VOTERS THIS YEAR AND

00:55:38.435 --> 00:55:40.971 region:rollup2
I THINK OF HISTORY IS A GUIDE

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:42.472 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS WILL PROBABLY APPROVE

00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:43.674 region:rollup2
THAT SO I WONDERED HOW THIS

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:45.709 region:rollup2
REQUEST FOR ONE AND A HALF

00:55:43.674 --> 00:55:47.611 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS. AYE INTERFACES

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:48.512 region:rollup2
WITH THAT IS THIS IS THIS IS IN

00:55:47.611 --> 00:55:50.247 region:rollup2
ADDITION COMPLEMENT OR REALLY

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:51.515 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS.

00:55:50.247 --> 00:55:52.549 region:rollup2
BUT ONE TIME MONEY WE'RE NOT

00:55:51.515 --> 00:55:53.951 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR ON GOING MONEY WHICH

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:55.986 region:rollup2
IS

00:55:53.951 --> 00:55:57.588 region:rollup2
I KNOW ONE OF THE CONCERNS.

00:55:55.986 --> 00:55:59.256 region:rollup2
FROM EVERYBODY IN THE

00:55:57.588 --> 00:56:01.058 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE BUT WHEN I WAS HERE

00:55:59.256 --> 00:56:02.125 region:rollup2
FROM GOVERNORS AND FOR MEMBERS

00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:03.894 region:rollup2
OF THE MINORITY PARTY BUT

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:05.529 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IS THAT.

00:56:03.894 --> 00:56:07.698 region:rollup2
AND YOU MAKE LONG TERM

00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:09.533 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS AND YOU KNOW IT

00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:10.968 region:rollup2
NEVER THEN GOES AWAY WE'RE

00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:12.302 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT ONE TIME MONEY.

00:56:10.968 --> 00:56:14.037 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN PURCHASE THE

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:16.707 region:rollup2
WAREHOUSE.

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:17.374 region:rollup2
FOR THE TRIAGE CENTERS SO THAT

00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:19.743 region:rollup2
WE CAN.

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:21.712 region:rollup2
SET UP A RENT STABILIZATION

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:22.880 region:rollup2
FUND.

00:56:21.712 --> 00:56:24.181 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.550 region:rollup2
TO NOTE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN ONE

00:56:24.181 --> 00:56:29.219 region:rollup2
TIME MONEY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:32.689 region:rollup2
FOR. EMERGENCY RESPONSE.

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:33.290 region:rollup2
AND ONGOING FUNDING.

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.758 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT PET BUT I DON'T THINK

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:36.226 region:rollup2
IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT IS PROBABLY

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:36.493 region:rollup2
THE REQUEST IS IN ADDITION TO

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.127 region:rollup2
THAT YES.

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:39.096 region:rollup2
.

00:56:37.127 --> 00:56:41.098 region:rollup2
THE.

00:56:39.096 --> 00:56:41.498 region:rollup2
AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU

00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:44.635 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS A AN

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:45.936 region:rollup2
EPIDEMIC.-CRISIS THAT'S KIND OF

00:56:44.635 --> 00:56:47.304 region:rollup2
EXISTENTIAL CRISIS THAT SPACE IN

00:56:45.936 --> 00:56:48.639 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:56:47.304 --> 00:56:49.273 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING HOMELESSNESS IN

00:56:48.639 --> 00:56:50.340 region:rollup2
PLACES WHERE WE'VE NEVER SEEN IT

00:56:49.273 --> 00:56:52.109 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.077 region:rollup2
THE.

00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:56.113 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS IS JUST

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:59.283 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF WE'RE NOT.

00:56:56.113 --> 00:57:00.450 region:rollup2
BEING OPEN TO ARE OPTIMISTIC

00:56:59.283 --> 00:57:01.919 region:rollup2
ABOUT OUR CHANCES OF SOLVING THE

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.220 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND A AND A IF I'M DOING

00:57:01.919 --> 00:57:04.054 region:rollup2
THE MATH RIGHT AND IF YOU HAD

00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:06.189 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THIS YEAR THAT

00:57:04.688 --> 00:57:09.026 region:rollup2

DOLLARS IN THIS REQUEST

00:57:09.693 --> 00:57:12.396 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND THEN IF YOU.

00:57:11.228 --> 00:57:13.697 region:rollup2
COMPARE THAT AGAINST THAT THE

00:57:12.396 --> 00:57:15.599 region:rollup2
HIGH END OF THE RANGE THAT YOU

00:57:13.697 --> 00:57:16.733 region:rollup2
MENTIONED WHICH IS AS MANY AS A

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:18.335 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND

LIES IN.

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:08.098 region:rollup2
THAT THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T A

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:09.733 region:rollup2
CURE BUT WE BELIEVE IN OUR

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:11.034 region:rollup2
CITIES.

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:12.536 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BEGIN TO

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:14.304 region:rollup2
SEE A DOWNWARD TREND IF WE FOCUS

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:16.273 region:rollup2
ON BOTH PREVENTION.

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:18.074 region:rollup2
EARLY INTERVENTION AND THE

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:20.010 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS OF THE CONTINUUM OF

CARE THAT WE HAVE DESCRIBED.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:23.113 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PROVEN TO WORK

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:24.180 region:rollup2
IF ONLY WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

BE ABLE TO.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.684 region:rollup2
TO DO MORE.

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:29.085 region:rollup2
MARK I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:30.620 region:rollup2
TEAM HERE AND YEAH I JUST WHAT

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:32.122 region:rollup2
MAKES SURE THAT WERE. THAT WERE

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.757 region:rollup2
TAKING A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:35.091 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM AND NOT JUST

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:36.293 region:rollup2
THROWING MONEY AT KNOW THAT YET.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:37.661 region:rollup2
CLINTON QUESTION FOR THE PANEL

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:39.896 region:rollup2
WE THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:42.799 region:rollup2
BALANCE BETWEEN EMERGENCY AND

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:43.533 region:rollup2
LONG TERM HOUSING FUNDING.

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.368 region:rollup2
HER SWORD LIKE ALAN'S NAY I

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.869 region:rollup2
THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.903 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY YOU KNOW QUITE

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:48.705 region:rollup2
FRANKLY.

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:49.806 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THEY ARE IN TERMS OF

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:51.875 region:rollup2
THEIR INVESTMENTS I THINK THE

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.542 region:rollup2
COUNTIES KNOW BEST WHERE TO PUT

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.978 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.580 region:rollup2
ADD. BEING THAT HOMELESSNESS AYE

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:58.114 region:rollup2
ISN'T ONLY AFFECTING PEOPLE WHO

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.816 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE STREETS IT'S ALSO

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:00.750 region:rollup2
AFFECTING OUR OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:02.085 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:04.654 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:05.989 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD OUTBREAKS OF OTHER

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:08.158 region:rollup2
DISEASES ENCAMPMENTS.

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:09.726 region:rollup2
THE CRIME ASSOCIATED WITH IT

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:12.062 region:rollup2
AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.862 region:rollup2
SO I THINK I CAN SAN FRANCISCO.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:14.698 region:rollup2
WE WOULD.

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:16.533 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THE

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:17.601 region:rollup2
MONEY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:18.868 region:rollup2
WE WOULD WANT TO FOCUS ON

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:20.937 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SHELTER.

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:22.472 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE INVESTED MUCH

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:23.840 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SHELTER FOR THE PAST

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:25.108 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.743 region:rollup2
INVESTING MOSTLY IN HOUSING

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:27.410 region:rollup2
OTHER COMMUNITIES MAY HAVE A

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.112 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.413 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO IT AND ALSO FOR US

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:32.515 region:rollup2
AS WE WANTED TO PLAY THE FUNDING

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:33.817 region:rollup2
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO RATHER

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:35.085 region:rollup2
THAN TRYING TO BUILD MORE

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:37.254 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:40.457 region:rollup2
MASTER LEASING OR USING. A RENT

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.457 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:43.326 region:rollup2
I THINK ARE ARE CRITICAL FOR

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:45.028 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO BUT IMAGINE THE

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:46.930 region:rollup2
SITUATION IS QUITE DIFFERENT AND

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:49.332 region:rollup2
IN SACRAMENTO IN LA.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:50.200 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW WE DO THIS FORMULA

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:52.235 region:rollup2
WISE.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.670 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:55.238 region:rollup2
BALANCE I RECOGNIZE A COUPLE

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.573 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:58.174 region:rollup2
PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:02:56.573 --> 01:02:58.708 region:rollup2
EFFORTS IN THE PIPELINE THAT NO

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.944 region:rollup2
PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:02.679 region:rollup2
WHICH.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:04.047 region:rollup2
I HOPE THE LEGISLATURE WILL.

01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:06.016 region:rollup2
SAID ESSENTIALLY POSITIVELY

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:08.685 region:rollup2
REFERENDA AND PUT ON THE BALLOT

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:10.887 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:13.690 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT TO PROPOSITION.

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:15.358 region:rollup2
WE GET THE HOUSING BOND AND

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:16.593 region:rollup2
HAVE A LAST YEAR'S PRODUCERS ALL

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:19.162 region:rollup2
GREAT WORK BY THE WAY.

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:20.930 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS THE BEGINNING

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.364 region:rollup2
THERE'S NEED FOR MORE PERMANENT

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.365 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:24.167 region:rollup2
.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:25.602 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:27.537 region:rollup2
I MEAN TO REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT

01:03:25.602 --> 01:03:29.105 region:rollup2
TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:31.841 region:rollup2
INTO TRUE.

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:34.477 region:rollup2
ONE FORMER KNOW THEIR OF TRIAGE.

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:35.979 region:rollup2
WE NEED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:37.180 region:rollup2
DOLLARS HERE STATEWIDE IN ORDER

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:38.682 region:rollup2
TO MAKE A REAL IMPACT AND CLOSER

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.784 region:rollup2
TO BILLION.

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:42.152 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE NEED. AND

01:03:40.784 --> 01:03:44.020 region:rollup2
I AM I HOPE THAT IN THE

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:44.421 region:rollup2
COMBINATION.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.989 region:rollup2
OF.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:47.891 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE SORTS OUT OF PLEA

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.726 region:rollup2
IN THAT SURPLUS IS LARGE.

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:51.494 region:rollup2
THAT JUNE THE CITIES AND THE

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:53.830 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT THERE CAN BE.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:55.565 region:rollup2
I'M INAPPROPRIATE DIVISION AND

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:57.300 region:rollup2
BALANCE THAT GIVES US THOSE

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:59.069 region:rollup2
KINDS OF RESOURCES EARTHLY PANEL

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.670 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY NUMBERS OUT THERE THAT

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:02.172 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY THE INTERVENTION ON

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:04.040 region:rollup2
THIS AND HOMELESSNESS VERSES OF

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:05.775 region:rollup2
THE SEASON WITH MILLION.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.409 region:rollup2
ALMOST LONGTIME THEIR NUMBERS

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:08.178 region:rollup2
THAT SHOW ALL YEAH.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:09.412 region:rollup2
.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:11.081 region:rollup2
AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE EXACT

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:12.015 region:rollup2
NUMBERS UP BE HAPPY TO SEND THEM

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:13.817 region:rollup2
BUT THE.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:16.519 region:rollup2
.

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:18.722 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU INTERVENE WITH SOMEONE

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:20.056 region:rollup2
WHO. IS EITHER ABOUT TO BE

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:21.024 region:rollup2
HOMELESS OR HAS ONLY BEEN

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:22.625 region:rollup2
HOMELESS FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:25.161 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:27.230 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR THE EXTENSIVE

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:29.866 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND THE COST ASSOCIATED

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:32.168 region:rollup2
WITH THAT IS GREATLY REDUCED

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:34.938 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU ARE. SORT OF.

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:38.308 region:rollup2
CATCHING THEM AS THEY FALL AND

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:40.510 region:rollup2
WITH SUPPORT IN THE SHORT TERM.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:42.645 region:rollup2
THEY CAN AND BECAUSE THE FACT IS

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:43.613 region:rollup2
IN LOS ANGELES WE PROBABLY HAVE

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:46.015 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE HUNDRED

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:47.183 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:48.618 region:rollup2
WHO CYCLE IN AND OUT OF

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:51.621 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:53.623 region:rollup2
MANY. AND MOST OF THEM SELF

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:54.224 region:rollup2
RESOLVE THEIR IN THEIR CAR

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.024 region:rollup2
COUPLE WEEKS AND THEN THERE'S

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.860 region:rollup2
THE PLACE THAT.

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:58.595 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS AND

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:02.198 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T SELF RESOLVE THIS

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:03.399 region:rollup2
SOONER THAT THEY ARE.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:05.769 region:rollup2
GIVEN ASSISTANCE.

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:07.971 region:rollup2
THE.

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:10.006 region:rollup2
CHEAPER IT IS TO HELP THEM.

01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:11.141 region:rollup2
AND THE GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:13.443 region:rollup2
THEY WILL NOT.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:16.012 region:rollup2
FALL BACK INTO HOMES.

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:17.847 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST.

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:19.382 region:rollup2
ED PUT IT THIS WAY MAYBE TO USE

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:21.084 region:rollup2
AN ANALOGY THEY'RE GOING

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:23.553 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS THAT WE HAVE A STAGE

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:25.155 region:rollup2
FOR SYSTEM.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:27.290 region:rollup2
RIGHT VULGATE CANCER.

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:30.493 region:rollup2
WHICH STATE FOR SYSTEM.

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:32.829 region:rollup2
AND WE SPEND BILLIONS TRYING TO

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:35.465 region:rollup2
CATCH OUR TAILS TO. ADDRESS THE

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:38.101 region:rollup2
FACT THAT WE HAVE AN INTERVENE.

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:39.269 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO STAGE FOR.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.004 region:rollup2
IF SOMEBODY IS HOMELESS FOR THE

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:42.939 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME.

THREE YEARS.

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:55.485 region:rollup2
OR GOD FORBID THREE DECADES.

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:57.420 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:59.456 region:rollup2
OF SUCCESS AND WE HAVE A MUCH

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.990 region:rollup2
BETTER CHANCE AT SAVING.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:02.258 region:rollup2
OF THOSE EXPENSIVE RESOURCES ON

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:04.527 region:rollup2
THE BACK AND.

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:06.029 region:rollup2
CHIU.

THANK YOU END UP I WANT TO THANK

01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:08.331 region:rollup2

ARTICULATING.

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:11.868 region:rollup2
Y. THE FLEXIBILITY SUPPORT

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.502 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THAT'S I THINK A

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:13.503 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT MANY OF US HAVE

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:15.472 region:rollup2
BEEN GRAPPLING WITH AND I THINK

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:16.806 region:rollup2
YOU CLEARLY. PUT IT IT'S TOO

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:18.408 region:rollup2
IT'S TO FOCUS ON RECENTLY

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:20.276 region:rollup2
HOMELESS.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:21.244 region:rollup2
FOLKS BECAUSE YOU THINK THERE'S

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:22.712 region:rollup2
A GOOD BANG FOR THE BUCK THERE

01:06:21.244 --> 01:06:23.913 region:rollup2
WHICH I I I I WOULD TEND TO

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:25.381 region:rollup2
AGREE. I I THINK ONE OF THE

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:27.050 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WERE ALL GRAPPLING

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:28.451 region:rollup2
WITH IS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:29.786 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE HOMELESS THERE'S

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.220 region:rollup2
SUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF

01:06:29.786 --> 01:06:32.055 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.456 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:33.723 region:rollup2
FOR WHOM WE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:34.991 region:rollup2
OF MONEY.

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:35.792 region:rollup2
TO.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.760 region:rollup2
TO.

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:38.561 region:rollup2
ECHO MISTER OBERNOLTE IS POINT

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.396 region:rollup2
WE KNOW IF YOU'RE CHRONICALLY

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:41.831 region:rollup2
HOMELESS ON THE STREETS IT MAY

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:43.566 region:rollup2
COST US FORTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:45.068 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A YEAR. BUT IF WE CAN

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:47.437 region:rollup2
GET THEM TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:48.738 region:rollup2
WE COULD HAVE THAT NUMBER. A AND

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:49.372 region:rollup2
BE MUCH MORE COST EFFICIENT

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.940 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IN SUPPORT OF I THINK

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:53.042 region:rollup2
WHAT I AM OR WE ARE ALTERNATE

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.843 region:rollup2
RAP WITH THIS POLICYMAKERS IS

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:55.778 region:rollup2
WHAT IS WHAT IS THAT RIGHT

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.981 region:rollup2
BALANCE. AND MY COMMITTEE WE DID

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:59.249 region:rollup2
AN ANALYSIS OF OF AB THIRTY ONE

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.617 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE AND OF AND A FEW

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:02.685 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE HAD SUGGESTED ARE

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:04.153 region:rollup2
ONE. OF SPENDING MONEY ON THE

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:06.122 region:rollup2
HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:07.891 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH IS THE ONLY STATE

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:09.959 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:11.327 region:rollup2
TRULY CHRONICALLY HOMELESS.

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:13.363 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT COHORT I JUST

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:14.697 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO WHO WOULD OTHERWISE

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.933 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN AND OUT OF

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:18.768 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOMS AND AND JAIL.

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:20.470 region:rollup2
AND AND JAIL FACILITIES IN

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:23.273 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:25.041 region:rollup2
COST US AN AWFUL LOT MORE THAN

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:25.642 region:rollup2
WE WOULD IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.442 region:rollup2
A WAY TO PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:28.077 region:rollup2
HEADS.

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:30.146 region:rollup2
I ALSO IF YOU'RE UP TO ME I

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:31.447 region:rollup2
THINK A LARGE PORTION OF THAT

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:33.616 region:rollup2
MONEY EVEN THREE QUARTERS OF

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:34.050 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING SHOULD GO TO MOVING

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:35.385 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:37.086 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:38.755 region:rollup2
INTO SUPPORT OF HOUSING IN A

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.989 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS PUMP

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:41.291 region:rollup2
BUT THAT BEING SAID IF I'M OPEN

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:42.625 region:rollup2
AND IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:43.960 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY MEANS I THINK IT. I

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:46.095 region:rollup2
THINK THE MORE INFORMATION WE

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.463 region:rollup2
HAVE FROM THE BIG ELEVEN CITIES

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.665 region:rollup2
ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE PLANS ARE

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:50.400 region:rollup2
SO THAT YOUR.

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:51.968 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN TEST THAT

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.468 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE LOT

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:53.636 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE WHAT POLICY

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:55.572 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES.

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:57.607 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN MANY MANY BUDGETS

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:59.542 region:rollup2
THROUGH MANY MANY POLITICIANS

01:07:57.607 --> 01:08:00.877 region:rollup2
AND HAVE SEEN SOME PROGRAMS WORK

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:03.346 region:rollup2
IN SOME PROGRAMS NOT AND AND

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:04.380 region:rollup2
THERE. THERE'S A DESIRE TO HAVE

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:05.815 region:rollup2
TO SPEND MONEY WHERE WE KNOW THE

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.317 region:rollup2
DATA SHOWS IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:08.418 region:rollup2
IMPACT AND YOU'RE PROPOSING.

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:09.752 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE NEW WAYS FOR US

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.521 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT WHICH VERY WELL COULD

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:13.022 region:rollup2
IMPACT THIS BUT I THINK IF WE

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:14.390 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT UP FRONT AND WE HAVE

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:15.692 region:rollup2
SOME METRICS UP FRONT THAT'LL.

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:17.860 region:rollup2
HELP MAKE EVERYONE FEEL MORE

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:18.661 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE ABOUT. ABOUT WHERE

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.396 region:rollup2
THIS GOES FAIR POINT.

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:21.331 region:rollup2
MANTIS

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:24.033 region:rollup2
AB ABSOLUTELY THAT.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:25.635 region:rollup2
.

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:27.337 region:rollup2
THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN.

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:29.572 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES OF

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:31.174 region:rollup2
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES BOARD OF

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:33.209 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS. TOTALLY AGREE AND

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:35.278 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE AND

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:38.281 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHY. ONE POINT TWO

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:40.483 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR BOND WAS PASSED.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:42.251 region:rollup2
FOR A CHRONICALLY HOMELESS HOUSE

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:44.587 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:47.423 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:49.258 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE PROB I MEASURE H.

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:53.463 region:rollup2
WAS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:55.498 region:rollup2
THAT. POPULATION WHILE SO USE IT

01:08:53.463 --> 01:08:57.200 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS AN INCREDIBLE

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:59.369 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AN ONGOING INVESTMENT

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.471 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE

01:08:59.369 --> 01:09:04.507 region:rollup2
OP. FUNDING FOR.

01:09:01.471 --> 01:09:06.709 region:rollup2
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:08.011 region:rollup2
SAID AND ANY NUMBER OF IS THAT

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:10.480 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE IS THAT SAME AS

01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:13.082 region:rollup2
WITH. A HOUSING FOR HEALTH AND

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.851 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:17.253 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ALSO?

01:09:14.851 --> 01:09:19.622 region:rollup2
POINT OUT IS THAT THAT IS

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:20.890 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT OF

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:22.925 region:rollup2
THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:25.795 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:28.531 region:rollup2
THAT THE OTHER.

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:31.034 region:rollup2
SIXTY SIX SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:33.369 region:rollup2
POPULATION. ARE THOSE PEOPLE

01:09:31.034 --> 01:09:33.703 region:rollup2
THAT ARE FALL IT BETTER IN THAT

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:35.905 region:rollup2
ARE HOMELESS.

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:37.106 region:rollup2
ARE NOT.

01:09:35.905 --> 01:09:39.108 region:rollup2
NECESSARY AND ARE NOT

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:40.943 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY MINT REGARDED AS

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:42.211 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL. BUT

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:43.813 region:rollup2
THE LONGER THEY ARE ON THE

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:45.748 region:rollup2
STREETS THE LONGER THE LID

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:48.017 region:rollup2
GREATER THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:48.551 region:rollup2
WILL BECOME THAT. PORTION OF THE

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.953 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT'S SO MUCH

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:52.288 region:rollup2
COSTLY.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.856 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:56.125 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:58.127 region:rollup2
WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT DO

01:09:56.125 --> 01:10:00.897 region:rollup2
ONE OR THE OTHER BUT TO DO BOTH

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:03.866 region:rollup2
AND IT WE COULD TACKLE THIS TO

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:05.835 region:rollup2
STABILIZE IN A WAY WHERE THEN.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:08.237 region:rollup2
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO.

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:10.440 region:rollup2
MORE ACCURATELY IDENTIFY SORT

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:13.076 region:rollup2
OF HOW MUCH GOES FOR CHRONICALLY

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:16.746 region:rollup2
HOMELESS VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE.

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:18.347 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SIMPLY HOMELESS BUT AT

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:21.184 region:rollup2
ANY EVENT IT'S

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:23.319 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WHERE THE INFLOW. HAS

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:27.156 region:rollup2
TO BE STEM IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:29.258 region:rollup2

LOOK AT THIS IS WHAT WE THINK

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:50.580 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAPPEN BUT I'M GONNA NEED

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:53.182 region:rollup2
TO HEAR FROM MY CITIES THAT.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.951 region:rollup2
BETTERS GRAPPLING WITH THIS AND.

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:56.319 region:rollup2
I'M STRUCK BY THE WHOLE IDEA

01:10:54.951 --> 01:11:00.156 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

01:10:56.319 --> 01:11:01.491 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION OP BECAUSE THEY.

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:03.059 region:rollup2
IT DIDN'T REALLY WHAT THAT WITH

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:04.727 region:rollup2
THE PREVENTION INTERVENTION GETS

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:06.395 region:rollup2
TO IS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WE

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:08.831 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH UNITS.

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:11.167 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE NOT AFFORDABLE.

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:12.635 region:rollup2
AND SO EIGHT THAT THAT'S BEEN IN

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:14.337 region:rollup2
INTRACTABLE PROBLEM IN OUR

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:15.771 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AS YOU KNOW ANYTIME

FACILITY FOR HOMELESS YOU GET

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:23.479 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS RESISTANCE FROM THE

COMMUNITY. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:27.049 region:rollup2
ON A REGIONAL BASIS TO TRY TO

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:29.185 region:rollup2
JUST ON.

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:30.553 region:rollup2

HOLDS THAT THERE ARE AND JUST

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:38.694 region:rollup2
BEING JUST TRYING TO GET OUT AND

WANTS.

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:49.438 region:rollup2
ANYBODY NEAR THEM AND SO ON SO

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:50.606 region:rollup2
THE DIFFICULT OF DOING THAT

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:52.241 region:rollup2
PREVENTION INTERVENTION WORK IS

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:53.442 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE THERE AND IT AND

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:56.045 region:rollup2
IT'S TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:57.613 region:rollup2
SO I'M STRUGGLING WITH HOW YOU

01:11:56.045 --> 01:12:00.383 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW IF YOU'RE GONNA GET

01:11:57.613 --> 01:12:00.850 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND ITS NEW RESOURCES

ACCOUNTABILITY HOW DO YOU SET UP

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:07.690 region:rollup2
THE METRICS SO THAT. THEN EVEN

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:08.691 region:rollup2
RURAL AND SMALLER COMMUNITIES

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:10.760 region:rollup2
ARE UTILIZING THE SAME

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:13.129 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY OR THE SAME SYSTEM

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.730 region:rollup2
OR SO THAT WERE ALL DOING THINGS

01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:16.199 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT REALLY IS GOING TO

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:18.534 region:rollup2
REACH AN OUTCOME. SO THAT WE

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:20.036 region:rollup2
DON'T PUT. TWO TWO BILLION HER A

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:21.771 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS OUT THE IN A

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:22.838 region:rollup2
YEAR AND THEN WE'RE IN THE EXACT

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:23.873 region:rollup2
SAME POSITION AND EVERYBODY

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:25.007 region:rollup2
COMES BACK THEN THEY REALLY

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:27.143 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS GOING TO

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.710 region:rollup2

SO WELL THAT I BUT I REALLY

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:31.981 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THIS DISCUSSION

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.015 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I REALLY HADN'T FOCUSED

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:34.517 region:rollup2
ON THE.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:36.519 region:rollup2
PREVENTION INTERVENTION PART OF

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:38.454 region:rollup2
IT WHICH IS WHICH IS THAT THAT'S

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.655 region:rollup2
A WHOLE ANALOGY OF PEOPLE.

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:40.656 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE STANDING AT THE RIVER

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:41.824 region:rollup2
AND THEY SEE BODIES FLOATING

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:43.359 region:rollup2
DOWN IN THERE TRYING TO FIGURE

01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:44.594 region:rollup2
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. GOING

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.995 region:rollup2

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.931 region:rollup2
IN THE FOR IN THE RIVER IN THE

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:50.867 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE AND THAT'S REALLY

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:52.001 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PREVENTION IS ALL ABOUT

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.636 region:rollup2
IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:54.804 region:rollup2
WE KEEP PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:56.539 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS?

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:57.073 region:rollup2
AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.408 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE AND THEY'RE THAT

01:12:57.073 --> 01:13:01.444 region:rollup2
CLOSE.

01:12:59.408 --> 01:13:02.678 region:rollup2
I HAD I HAD BOMB AND I KNOW THAT

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:03.613 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE SICK OF ME TELLING

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:05.214 region:rollup2
THIS TALE BUT I HAD A

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:06.515 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH THE WOMAN WHO

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:08.451 region:rollup2

A SERIOUS.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:25.695 region:rollup2
A STATE ISSUE.

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:27.663 region:rollup2
I I FEEL LIKE A MORE THAN HALF

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:30.366 region:rollup2
OF MY TIME HERE AT THE.

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:30.967 region:rollup2

DO IS.

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:37.840 region:rollup2
.

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:38.374 region:rollup2
IF WE PROVIDE THE ENOUGH MONEY

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.342 region:rollup2
OR THE SOLUTION WOULD BE.

01:14:38.374 --> 01:14:41.110 region:rollup2
.

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:42.611 region:rollup2
IN A FOUND.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:42.812 region:rollup2

IT IS JUST THE IN.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.490 region:rollup2

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:04.667 region:rollup2
HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL WE

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:06.635 region:rollup2

JUST ABOUT THE ON A DAILY BASIS

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:09.839 region:rollup2
BUT THAT JUST ACROSS THE STREET

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:10.673 region:rollup2
THE.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:13.309 region:rollup2

REDUCE THAT NUMBER.

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:19.849 region:rollup2
IT IS SO FULL OF SHAME FOR US

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:20.883 region:rollup2

AT THE EVEN THAT THE KEPT THEIR

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:34.296 region:rollup2
CD WE CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:36.465 region:rollup2
ARE AYE I HAVE A MAYBE. I THINK

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:38.000 region:rollup2
I THINK I CAN TALK HIM INTO MANY

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:41.470 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK ARE.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.173 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HEAR PREVENTION AND

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:45.608 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION COR LISTED ALL

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:48.744 region:rollup2
KINDS OF GOOD WORDS.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:53.549 region:rollup2
IN ALL MY WAY OF LOOKING AT THE

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:55.851 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS SO. WE ARE TRYING TO.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:57.219 region:rollup2
A PROVIDE I COME UP WITH SOME

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:59.088 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS SO TO THE PROBLEM BUT

01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:01.056 region:rollup2
THE.

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:05.161 region:rollup2
IS TO MORE THAN PREVENTION WHAT

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:07.063 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION Y. SUCH A PROBLEM.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:08.631 region:rollup2
IS SUPPOSED TO STING AND THE

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:09.265 region:rollup2
INCREASING.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:16.739 region:rollup2
NOT DECREASING I KNOW THIS IS A

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:18.407 region:rollup2
NOT US IMPROVE.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:20.843 region:rollup2
ANSWER.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:22.478 region:rollup2
OF HOWEVER.

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:25.714 region:rollup2
WHY DID IT BECOME THE YOU KNOW

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:26.782 region:rollup2

WITH NO MONEY RIGHT.

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:30.553 region:rollup2
WHY NO MONEY NO JOBS?

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:33.355 region:rollup2
WHY NO JOBS?

01:16:30.553 --> 01:16:35.691 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING PROCURER

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:37.460 region:rollup2
SO TOOL WE KNOW WHO MAY. ARE

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:38.694 region:rollup2
HIRE THEM.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:41.564 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE WE DO SEE

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE COST DOWN.

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:45.501 region:rollup2
AS YOU ARE KNOWN A WILL

CALIFORNIA IS SO KNOWN AS A

01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:49.872 region:rollup2
NOTORIOUS.

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:51.240 region:rollup2
BUSINESS REGULATIONS AND THE

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:53.909 region:rollup2

NO THOSE ARE THE DIRECTLY.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.997 region:rollup2
COORDINATED ISSUES.

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:16.292 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BY FOSTERING ON THE

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:18.093 region:rollup2
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT THAT THAT'S

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:18.827 region:rollup2
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SO I THINK

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:21.130 region:rollup2
APPLAUSE OF THE DEEP MORE

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:22.331 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE THINGS SO WE NEED

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:24.266 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT THE.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:25.100 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:28.370 region:rollup2
THAT WE CREATE THAT PROBLEM.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.572 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.805 region:rollup2
LOOK THAT DUST OF FRUSTRATION

01:18:29.572 --> 01:18:31.640 region:rollup2
INSIDE.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:33.776 region:rollup2
OF ME.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.979 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT'S MY. DUFF VENTING MY

01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:39.915 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION HERE'S MY QUESTION.

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:41.917 region:rollup2
ONE OF YOU CITIES. FOR ALL.

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:44.019 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:46.088 region:rollup2
SOME FRANCISCO WERE LA OR

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:48.924 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO.

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:51.060 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO. WORK A

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:53.696 region:rollup2
CREATE OF PROFIT.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:55.464 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP.

01:18:53.696 --> 01:18:57.233 region:rollup2
OUR FOR STARVING THOUGH ON

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:59.902 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS ISSUES THAT THERE

01:18:57.233 --> 01:19:02.504 region:rollup2
WAS SOMEONE. A BUSINESSMAN WHO

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:04.406 region:rollup2
APPROACHED ME FROM A CHINA.

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:06.709 region:rollup2
HE.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:09.111 region:rollup2
ONE HIS ARE LOOKING FOR A CITY

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:10.512 region:rollup2
OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAP OR. WHAT

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:13.649 region:rollup2
TONY?

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:14.283 region:rollup2
THAT THE GIVING THEM AUTHORITY

01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:15.050 region:rollup2
AND THAT GIVING THE PARTNERSHIP

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:17.453 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:19.154 region:rollup2
.

01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:20.589 region:rollup2
IF HE WERE TO SOLVE ALL THE

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:22.157 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS SO WE FEEL LESS THAN

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:24.627 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF THE GOVERNMENT

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:27.096 region:rollup2
OR WOULD HAVE COST.

01:19:24.627 --> 01:19:28.030 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT ARE I THINK THAT

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:30.266 region:rollup2
ONE OF TWO CONDITIONS.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:32.568 region:rollup2
IS SELF.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:33.736 region:rollup2
HELPING THEM FIND THE ZONING

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:35.604 region:rollup2
PLAYER.

01:19:33.736 --> 01:19:37.139 region:rollup2
.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:39.441 region:rollup2
THE FACILITIES AT THAT HOUSING

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:41.143 region:rollup2
CAN BE PLACED.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:43.078 region:rollup2
AND THE BUILDING PROMISE WOULD

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:45.247 region:rollup2
BE EXPEDITED.

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:46.949 region:rollup2
AND THEN EDUCATION ISSUES HEALTH

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:49.618 region:rollup2
ISSUES TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:52.454 region:rollup2
OF WHATEVER EDUCATION ISSUE SO

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:53.822 region:rollup2
THEY WERE. ARMED DEPARTMENT.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:55.424 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT ALISA AND THEN

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:57.593 region:rollup2
HELP THEM.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:59.795 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS IS SO IT GREEK

01:19:57.593 --> 01:20:01.664 region:rollup2
IDEA GOVERNMENT TRIED THAT CASE

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:04.166 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TRIED AND TRIED THE IT

01:20:01.664 --> 01:20:06.135 region:rollup2
HAS NOT WORKED.

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:07.670 region:rollup2
HAS ANYBODY APPROACH.

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:09.672 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROBLEM THE PUBLIC

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:11.573 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP APPROACH IF YOU HAVE

01:20:09.672 --> 01:20:15.010 region:rollup2
NOT THE WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:15.644 region:rollup2
LISTEN AND TALK TO THE PERSON.

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.412 region:rollup2
THAT AFFECTS ONE MAKING PROFITS

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:20.315 region:rollup2
DOT BEFORE ON THE BACKS OF

01:20:16.412 --> 01:20:21.050 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS IS IS THE CORRECT

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:22.851 region:rollup2
METHOD FOR THIS.

01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:24.086 region:rollup2
AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:25.587 region:rollup2
EARLY SADISM.

01:20:24.086 --> 01:20:27.723 region:rollup2
JOBS OBVIOUSLY MINIMUM WAGE JOBS

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:29.792 region:rollup2
IS NOT A FAVORITE AS A BIG ISSUE

01:20:27.723 --> 01:20:31.293 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TREE LA JOBS BUT

01:20:29.792 --> 01:20:32.361 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE JOBS DON'T PAY RATE

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:34.129 region:rollup2
WILL NOT BY YOU HOUSE.

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:35.531 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK YOU KNOW THE BIG

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:36.565 region:rollup2
GREAT PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:38.667 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS IN CERTAIN AREAS

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:39.601 region:rollup2
BUT FOR HOMELESSNESS AYE AYES

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.969 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS THE ONLY

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:42.571 region:rollup2
THING OF IT WHEN YOU REALLY

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:43.639 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IT. THE MOST

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:45.240 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMBAT

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:46.542 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS IS HROUGH FORM OF

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.044 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:50.312 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE COUNTIES THEMSELVES

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:51.780 region:rollup2
GENERALLY.

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:53.882 region:rollup2
DO NOT RUN THE PGA OR THE CITIES

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.485 region:rollup2
DON'T ACTUALLY RUN THE PROGRAMS.

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:58.087 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY WORK WITH.

01:20:56.485 --> 01:21:00.255 region:rollup2
MOSTLY NON PROFIT BUT THERE ARE

01:20:58.087 --> 01:21:02.458 region:rollup2
A FEW FOR PROFIT PROVIDERS WHO

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:03.292 region:rollup2
HAVE THE EXPERTISE.

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:05.461 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO.

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:09.331 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO HELP THE POPULATION

01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:11.266 region:rollup2
THE WAY

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:13.001 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY THE CAPACITY.

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:14.970 region:rollup2
BUILD OF THE COMMUNITY BASED

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:16.905 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:19.341 region:rollup2
THAT I SUPPOSE COULD INCLUDE.

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:21.210 region:rollup2
A FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:24.613 region:rollup2
THAT THAT DID THAT WORK. BUT

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:26.582 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE THE INFUSION OF

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:29.918 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INVESTMENT.

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:31.653 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER.

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:33.922 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE SECTOR IF YOU WILL

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:35.557 region:rollup2
OR THE NONPROFIT SECTOR TO BE

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:37.159 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO ONE OF THE WORKS I

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.827 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S OF IP INTEREST IN

01:21:37.159 --> 01:21:39.995 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION.

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:42.064 region:rollup2
OKAY YOU KNOW.

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:42.865 region:rollup2
AT JUST WHY NOT NOW THERE COULD

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:44.066 region:rollup2
BE A COOK THERE COULD BE A

01:21:42.865 --> 01:21:45.801 region:rollup2
KERNEL OF SOME THEIR.

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:47.069 region:rollup2
.

01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:48.537 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WE WOULD BE INTERESTED

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.904 region:rollup2
AS WELL AND WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:50.105 region:rollup2
EXPLORING.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.673 region:rollup2
.

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:52.174 region:rollup2
CREDIT TENANT LEASE FINANCING

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:53.842 region:rollup2
MODEL.

01:21:52.174 --> 01:21:55.477 region:rollup2
IN WHICH THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:57.012 region:rollup2
COULD CONSTRUCT.

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:58.380 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT COULD

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:59.848 region:rollup2
THEN BE LEAST BACK.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:02.050 region:rollup2
BY THE COUNTY.

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:03.986 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO CUT CONSTRUCTION

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:05.053 region:rollup2
COSTS AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT

01:22:03.986 --> 01:22:06.455 region:rollup2
TAKES TO BUILD HOUSING SO WE'RE

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:07.856 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY LOOKING AT AT

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:09.625 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE MODELS AND WOULD BE

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:11.093 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO. HAVE CONVERSATIONS

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:12.628 region:rollup2
WITH WITH ANYONE WHO'S GOT I

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:15.097 region:rollup2
KNOW ALREADY HAPPY TO MAKE THAT

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:18.500 region:rollup2
TO PREACH. AND AND AND NOT BASED

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:20.402 region:rollup2
UPON OUR WHAT I'VE READ HERE IS

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:22.070 region:rollup2
SUCH TRYING TO GET RID OF OUR.

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:23.939 region:rollup2
NOW FAITH THE BASTER COMMUNITY

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:25.808 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ARE I MEAN AND TO

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:28.043 region:rollup2
ME IT THIS HAS SO WRONG IN OUR

01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:30.179 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO SOMEONE'S CENTER.

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:31.780 region:rollup2
NOW THE HOUSING FIRST OR WHAT

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:33.682 region:rollup2
WOULD SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS SO

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:35.117 region:rollup2
ONE ENTITY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:36.819 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO THAT THOUGH IT

WOULDN'T IT WILL IT DIDN'T WORK.

01:22:36.819 --> 01:22:41.223 region:rollup2

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:42.858 region:rollup2
EITHER.

01:22:41.223 --> 01:22:44.526 region:rollup2
