APPOINTMENT- THIS IS MIKE MY

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.484
CONSCIENCE GUIDING ME IT HAS

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:06.953
NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY ONE

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:08.788
PARTICULAR PERSON. BUT IT

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:11.190
SPEAKS TO A REAL FACT THAT IF

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:13.192
WE ARE GOING TO WORK TO CHANGE

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.761
A SYSTEM THEN WE CANNOT PLACATE

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:19.398
IT BY REALLY ALLOWING PEOPLE.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.868
TO MOVE AROUND MY DECK CHAIRS-

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.570
ON A TITANIC YOU KNOW CDC ARE

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.272
IS A BROKEN SYSTEM AND IF YOU

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.507
HAVE READ ANY OF THE ARTICLES

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:30.877
IN THE RECENT WEEKS- PEOPLE ARE

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:33.946
LITERALLY DYING EMPLOYEES AND

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.849
INCARCERATED FOLKS. AND I THINK

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.284
WE NEED TO HAVE A VERY HONEST

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.786
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE RE

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.956
IMAGINE A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.859
FORCE FOLKS WHO WORK THERE. TO

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:51.330
KILL THEMSELVES OR. TO BEGIN TO

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:53.466
ENGAGE IN. HARMFUL ACTIVITIES-

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.135
OF SELF HARM SO THAT THEY CAN

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.204
CONTINUE WORKING I THINK WE

00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.705
HAVE TO HAVE A REAL DIALOGUE

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.707
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:05.378
OF THESE PRISONS. BECAUSE AT

THE END OF THE DAY THAT BLOOD.

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:12.084
THAT SPILLS. IS ON OUR HANDS SO

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.986

ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.161
BROKEN SYSTEM AND WE ARE ASKING

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.730
FOLKS TO STEP INTO IT. AND TRY

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:27.466
TO MAKE IT WORK. AND IT'S THE

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:31.370
WAY. I HAVE NO WORDS BUT I WANT
