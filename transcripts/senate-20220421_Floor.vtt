THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:10.040

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.425
TROUBLE IMPOSSIBLE NOW THE WHOLE

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:30.227
COUNTRY REALIZING THAT THE R. P.

00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:31.762
S. STANDARD IMPOSSIBLE NOW

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:33.097
WHAT'S HAPPENING AND EVEN UNDER

PRESIDENT NIXON UNDER THE CLEAN

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.501
AIR ACT IMPOSSIBLE WHEN I WAS

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:39.002
GROWING UP IN LOS ANGELES AND WE

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.937
HAD TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:43.207
DAYS. OF SMOG THAT ALERTS AND

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:44.007
NOW THERE'S BEEN NONE.

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:47.311
IMPOSSIBLE WE HAVE TO ENGAGE.

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:48.946
NOW THERE'S SOME ARGUMENTS THAT

00:45:49.012 --> 00:45:50.647
SAY THAT YOU CAN ONLY FLUSH THE

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:52.049
TOILET ONCE TODAY UNDER THESE

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:54.918
STANDARDS. ARE AND TAKE A SHOWER

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:56.086
EVERY OTHER DAY BUT THAT'S NOT

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:57.688
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT IS NOT

00:45:57.754 --> 00:46:00.557
FACTUAL IT IS GREAT FODDER FOR

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:02.392
TWITTER IN THIS SOCIAL MEDIA

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:03.460
WAR. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THE

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:05.896
TRUTH. WE BUILT IN FLEXIBILITY

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:07.064
IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE THE

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.832
INDOOR EFFICIENCY STANDARDS THE

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:10.601
SUBJECT OF THIS MEASURE. ARE

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:12.636
JUST ONE PART OF A TOTAL FORMULA

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.605
TO DETERMINE HOW WATER USAGE

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:17.441
MUST BE MADE. BETTER OVERALL

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:19.109
WATER JUICE OF THE ISSUE ON A

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:21.545
SYSTEM WIDE BASIS WE'VE ALREADY

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:23.313
SEEN SUCCESS OF OUR EFFORTS.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.448
WHICH IS PROOF THAT THE WATER

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:27.117
USAGE HAS BEEN ON A STEADY

00:46:27.184 --> 00:46:28.285
DECLINE THE CURRENT MEDIUM WATER

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:30.587
USAGES FORTY EIGHT GALLONS PER

00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:32.122
CAPITA DAILY. AND THAT IS WELL

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:33.790
BELOW THE TWENTY TWENTY STANDARD

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:36.059
WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN STATUTE.

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:38.862
SOME SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE

00:46:38.929 --> 00:46:41.031
COSTLY IS GOING TO COST THE TOP.

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:43.100
WELL THAT'S- LET ME. THAT

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:43.667
THERE'S NOTHING LESS. THAN

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:44.968
CONSERVATION THE SAME ARGUMENTS

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:46.803
ARE MET TIME AND TIME AND TIME

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.639
AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:50.607
RUN OUT OF WATERWHAT'S THE COST

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:51.808
WHEN YOU RUN INTO WATER TO

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.677
SOCIETY TO EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:56.146
OUR LIFE. WE HAVE TO SET THE

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.248
STANDARDS TOO CAN. TO CONSERVE

00:46:58.315 --> 00:47:01.585
GOING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE.

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:02.786
AND IF THE STATE DOESN'T SET

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:03.987
THOSE STANDARDS. AND WE DON'T

00:47:04.054 --> 00:47:05.455
DETERMINE WHAT CONSERVATION

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:07.591
OFFICIALS SHE MEANS AS I SUGGEST

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.326
WE WILL BE EVEN BIGGER TROUBLE

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:10.994
BECAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE HAS

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:12.696
THROWN ALL OF THE RULES OUT OF

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:15.532

WANT TO PUT. DAMS ON RIVERS AND

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:20.464
THAT'S FINE WE HAVE AN

THE PROP ONE BONDS BUT IT'S NOT

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.339

CAN USE THE WATER MORE

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.627
EFFICIENTLY. WE TALK ABOUT

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:53.297
CONCERT CONCERT CONSERVATION.

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:28.705
FOR THINGS. AND THEN NOT DOING.

00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:32.208
WE HAVE A HISTORY OF PUTTING

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:34.644
THINGS OUT TO THE VOTERS.

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.846
GENERATING THE PR IN THE

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:38.815
MACHINERY THAT WILL ALLOW THINGS

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:41.551
TO PASS AND THEN DELIBERATELY

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:43.686
USING THE INSTRUMENTS OF STATE.

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:45.989
DO NOT ALLOW THE WILL OF THE

00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:50.360
VOTERS TO BE AFFECTED. IN TWENTY

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:53.363
FOURTEEN PROP ONE WAS PASSED.

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:57.066
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE THEN

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:59.602
. IN THIS YET NOTHING WAS DONE.

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:01.671
THE GOAL POSTS HAVE BEEN MOVED

00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:04.274
BY THE RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.175
ON WHETHER OR NOT ENVIRONMENTAL

00:59:06.242 --> 00:59:09.646
CONCERNS OF TODAY ARE EXACTLY

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:11.848
LIKE THOSE BACK IN THE DAY WHEN

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:12.949
THAT THE MATTER WAS FIRST

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.951
REVIEWED SO IN SHORT THE

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.686
INSTRUMENTS AND DIVISIONS IN IN

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:19.088
ORGANIZATIONS OF THE STATE HAVE

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:21.758
FOUND WAYS TO OBFUSCATE THE WILL

00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:24.961
OF THE VOTERS. THIS IS A

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.996
CREDIBILITY PROBLEM WHEN

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:30.500
LEGISLATURES LIKE US. BANCED A

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:32.035
BILL IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF

00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:34.604
CALIFORNIANS PROBABLY KNOWING

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.906
THERE WILL NEVER BE AN AFFECTION

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:39.742
WE XIN OF THAT OUTCOME. THIS IS

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:42.178
DISHEARTENING IN THE GIVES US A

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.613
CREDIBILITY PROBLEM. NOW WE

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.049
HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR OF THIS OF

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:48.985
THIS BILL CONSERVATION IS

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:51.187
ESSENTIAL AND I WOULD I WOULD

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:52.455
VENTURE TO SAY CONSERVATION IS

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.991
DEFINITELY PART OF PART OF THE-

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:57.126
PART THE CALCULUS HERE. WE ALSO

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:59.295
HEARD THAT THE AVERAGE USAGES

00:59:59.362 --> 01:00:00.196
FORTY EIGHT GALLONS PER PERSON

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.231
PER DAY. WHICH IS BASICALLY IN

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:04.500
LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:05.301
WITH THIS NEW PROPOSAL RIGHT

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:08.204
NOW. SO I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT TO

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.372
WHAT EFFECT THIS WILL ACTUALLY

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:13.543
YIELD. BUT I WOULD CAUTION THE

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:15.645
AUTHOR IN IN SUPPORTERS THEY'RE

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.180

INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT. THEY

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.924
ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:29.959
YOU CAN'T CONSERVE OUR WAY OUT

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:33.763
UNLESS YOU BUILT. IN CONCERT.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.631
CENTER NIELSEN IT'S TO BE THE

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:37.433
CENTER FROM TO HIM AND I HAD A

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.003
BILL IT WAS SHOT DOWN THE FIRST

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:42.538
COMMITTEE AND IT WAS SIMPLY TO

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.107
GET A FACT TO MONEY THAT'S

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:45.842
ALREADY BEEN APPROPRIATED BY THE

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:47.577
VOTERS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:49.278
SITES RESERVOIR MOVES FORWARD AS

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:51.881
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WE

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:54.417
HAVE IN OUR VALLEY. HOW

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.451
INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST CAN WE

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:59.522
BE TO VOTE DOWN TO SOMETHING THE

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:02.091
VOTERS APPROVED. THIS IS THE

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:05.828
EPITOME OF HYPOCRISY. AND WE DO

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.997
OR WE DO OUR BEST TO BUILD

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:10.233
COLLEGIALITY IN THIS IN THIS IN

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.402

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.670
THAT OUR WORD MEANS SOMETHING.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:16.839
BUT MY CONCERN. AND IT'S NOT

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.808
THIS BILL IT IS THE TOPIC OF

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.411
WATER IN BILL THE LACK OF

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.279
COMMITMENT TO EFFECTUATE THE

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:26.215
WILL OF THE VOTERS IN THE NEEDS

OF OUR STATE FOR TODAY AND

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.952
TOMORROW. THAT WHEN WE ALLOW ME

SEGREGATE AND WE

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.390
COMPARTMENTALIZE AND WE

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:37.326
SEPARATE. WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:39.095
DYNAMIC ISSUE REQUIRING A

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.297
MULTISECTOR APPROACH THAT WE'RE

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:44.000

FERNANDO VALLEY. AND JUST GET

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.420
SOME FACTS STRAIGHT HERE ABOUT

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.855
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:37.026
WE'RE- MAKING PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:41.397
CREDIBILITY- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.065
THE FUTURE AS SOME FORM OF

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:45.034
NOSTALGIA THAT SUDDENLY

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:47.336
CALIFORNIANS GOING TO LOOK LIKE

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.405
IT USED TO. IN THE NEXT TEN AND

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.807
TWENTY YEARS WE'RE LIVING IN A

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:54.510
FANTASY WORLD. THE THOUGHT THAT

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:56.746
THE RAINS WILL JUST COME BACK

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.748
FOR BECAUSE IT WAS A AWAY YEAR

01:06:58.814 --> 01:07:00.883
LAST YEAR ALSO MEANS THAT THE

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.551
DROUGHT ISN'T HAMMERING OUR

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:05.154
COMMUNITIES. IS SO AT ODDS WITH

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.523
WHAT'S HAPPENING IT IS GOING TO

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:10.860
BE WIDER THAN FLOOD MORE. AND

01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:12.661
WE'RE IS GOING TO BE DRIER AND

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.263
WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE SEVERE

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.698
DROUGHTS THOSE TWO IN THIS

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:19.568
CLIMATE ERA THAT GREAT SNAPBACK

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:20.536
. IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:22.471
OUR EYES AND SO I JUST I'M SO

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:24.673
INCREDULOUS BECAUSE WHEN WE AS

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.542
URBAN WATER USERS GO TO TIGHTEN

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.544
OUR BELTS AND I THINK THIS IS AN

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:30.146
ENORMOUS ACT OF SELF SACRIFICE

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:31.380
FOR THE HEART OF URBAN WATER

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:33.849
USE. IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.384
TO BE STEPPING AND SAY WE'RE

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:36.786
GONNA DO OUR PART. WE WANT TO

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:39.221
PUT OUR EFFICIENCY ON THE TABLE

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:40.489
AND SAY WILL STEP UP. AND THOSE

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.457
WHO WANT SUPPLY ELSEWHERE

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.359
SAYING. WELL WHY WOULD YOU

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:45.528
TIGHTEN YOUR BELTS. THAT DOESN'T

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:47.596
MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.865
BUILDING A DAM SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.133
THAT'S NOT EVEN SHOVEL READY.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.035
BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:54.970
MORE SOBER ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.038
THE WATER CONVERSATION THIS

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.640
ISN'T A PLACE FOR POSTURE THIS

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.809
IS A LACE FOR DELIVERING. THE

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.110
SENATE DELIVERED LAST YEAR IN

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:02.211
ITS BUDGET ON ITS DROUGHT

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:03.779
PACKAGE AND WE'RE GONNA BE

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.815
DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT I

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:06.782
GUARANTEE YOU IT'S HAPPENING

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:07.850
THIS YEAR I HAVE. UTTER

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.952
CONFIDENCE IN MY COLLEAGUES TO

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:11.654
GET. THIS WORK DONE BUT I WOULD

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.122
CAUTION AGAINST ANY SOFTENING

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.524
HERE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.525
CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE WE

01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:17.893
STRUGGLE BECAUSE THIS BILL IS

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.296
ACTUALLY A COMPROMISE. THIS BILL

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.331
WALKS BACK WHAT WHAT LEGISLATION

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:24.033
LAST YEAR WOULD HAVE DONE IN

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:25.968
RATCHETING DOWN THE EFFICIENCY

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:29.004
STANDARDS IN URBAN USE. TO FORTY

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:30.739
EIGHT GALLONS PER DAY. THIS IS

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:33.409
ONLY FIFTY FIVE GALLONS PER DAY

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:34.610
WHAT CURRENT LOSSES UNTIL TWENTY

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:36.011
TWENTY FIVE. WE'RE NOT ASKING

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.681
ANYONE TO DO THIS WORK RIGHT NOW

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:39.548
BUT IF WE CAN'T SOLVE OVER OUR

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.350
WAY THROUGH SOME ADDITIONAL

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.018
SEWER GAS THAT GETS BUILT UP

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:43.953
BECAUSE WE'RE BEING MORE

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.988
EFFICIENT OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.356
UPGRADES WE NEED BECAUSE- MAYBE

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:49.825
YOU'RE NOT. PUSHING AS MUCH OUT

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:51.560
OF YOUR SHOWERS. OR YOUR HOUSES

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.995
THROUGH URBAN WATER USE AND IT'S

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:54.630
NOT GOING TO THE WASTE WATER

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:55.564
TREATMENT PLANT. THERE ARE

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.566
THINGS THAT CAN BE SOLVED HERE

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:59.335
WE CAN ENGINEER OUR WAY THROUGH

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:01.170
THIS BUT- IF WE DON'T EVEN HAVE

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:02.071
SPACE TO HOLD OURSELVES

01:09:02.137 --> 01:09:03.806
ACCOUNTABLE IN THE URBAN AREAS

01:09:03.873 --> 01:09:05.941
OF. OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.576
UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MOVE

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.111
FORWARD HERE SO. I RESPECTFULLY

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:11.113

AUTHOR BY IN EVERY HEADLINE THAT

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:26.595
HE I HAVE READ ON. IS VERY

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.497
CONCERNING VERY REAL AND I KNOW

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.533
THAT- WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO DO

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:33.636
SOMETHING ABOUT. THE CRISIS I

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:34.737
ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.839
WATER CONSERVATION AND SETTING

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.841
NEW STANDARDS ARE CRITICAL.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.644
HOWEVER FOR ME IT'S A LITTLE.

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.512
DIFFERENT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:09:43.579 --> 01:09:44.813
IN ORDER TO GET THIS DONE WE

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.882
HAVE TO. INVOLVE OUR LOCAL WATER

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:48.117
AGENCIES SO THAT'S WHERE MY

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:49.752
CONCERN LIES THAT WE'RE PUTTING

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:52.321
A TREMENDOUS BURDEN. FINANCIAL

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:53.522
BURDEN ON THESE LOCAL AGENCIES

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:56.091
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT GIVING ANYONE

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.860
A PASS BUT IT'S ABOUT GIVING

01:09:57.927 --> 01:10:00.396
THEM TIME AND ALLOWING THEM TO

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.298

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.335
ARE I WANT TO RECONSIDER THE

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.003
BILL LATER ON AS THE

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:09.705
CONVERSATIONS MOVE BUT- YOU KNOW

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:11.840
I UNDERSTAND AT A LOCAL LEVEL

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:13.709
HOW. MUCH THIS IS GOING TO PUT

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:16.879
ON THEM AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.347

ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THAT SITES

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.319
RESERVOIR IS NOT ALREADY BUILT.

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:58.654
YOUR FRANKLY I THINK THAT'S

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.689
GOING TO BE WHAT IS GOING TO BE

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:03.259

IT TWO DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.370

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:16.372
WHERE WE ARE NOW AND I WOULD

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:19.241
SAY. THAT WE ARE GOING FOR I

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:20.609

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.814
TO BLOW THAT AND NOT HAVE IT

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:28.083
HAPPEN I THINK IT'S ON ITS WAY.

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.885
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.620
WALK. TALK INTO GO AND DO

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:34.189
THINGS- ON THE OTHER SIDE

BELIEVE IN EXPLODING SQUIRRELS

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:57.613
BUT WHAT I DO BELIEVE IN IS THAT

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.882
WE HAVE A FINITE NATURAL

01:11:59.948 --> 01:12:03.852

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:10.292
REALITY ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE.

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:11.326
SO MY DISTRICT IS NOT AN

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:12.628
AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT AND I

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.563
ACTUALLY WASN'T PLANNING TO

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:17.466
SPEAK ON THIS BILL. BUT WE DO

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.635
USE WATER IN THE THIRTY S.

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:22.271
SENATE DISTRICT AND AS A STATE

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:24.440
WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:27.776
WATER USAGE CONSERVATION.

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:31.380

ALSO TALKING ABOUT MANAGING

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.555
CONSUMPTION THAT'S JUST A

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:42.925
REALITY. WE NEED A STATE WIDE

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:45.360

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:53.235
VARIES FROM THE TIP OF THE STATE

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:55.471
TO THE BOTTOM. BUT UNTIL WE GET

FROM- BIEBER SAID. IT IS IT'S

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:48.290
FRUSTRATING TO SEE THAT WE DON'T

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:50.292
HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:51.927
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:54.530
TO CONSERVE ON ONE HAND BUT THEN

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.098
ALSO TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.900
OTHER ISSUES THAT WILL ENSURE

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.768
THAT WE HAVE WATER. AND THAT

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.371
THAT OUR STATE CAN DROUGHT PROOF

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:04.773
ITSELF AND THAT WE DON'T END UP

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.941
PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:07.676
THE WATER WAR I'M SO THE BIG

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:10.412
PICTURE IS I THINK WE NEED- WE

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:11.613
NEED WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.149
OUT HOW WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO PUT

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:17.286
OUR RESOURCES INTO. RECYCLING TO

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:19.288
ABOUT CAPTURING THESE- FLOOD

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:21.857
YEARS THAT THAT HAPPENED IN IN

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.959
OUR REGION CREATE OPPORTUNITIES

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:27.296
TO TAKE THAT WATER AND- SAVE IT

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:30.766
UP BUT BUT I ALSO. AM FRUSTRATED

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.801
THAT WHEN THE STATE GETS TO A

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.436
DROUGHT THE DIFFERENT REGIONS

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:36.972
ARE ASKED TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.974
DESPITE THE FACT THAT TWO THIRDS

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:42.244
OF OUR RESIDENTS. TAKE WATER

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.812
FROM THE DELTA. SO IF TO OF OUR

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:45.547
TO OUR RESIDENTS ARE TAKING

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:46.915
WATER FROM THE DELTA AND WE HAVE

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.817
A DROUGHT THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:49.785
BE TOLD YOU YOU HAVE TO CONSERVE

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.653
AND THAT MEANS. PUTTING

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.956
MANDATORY CONSERVATION-

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:55.924
OBLIGATIONS ON EVERYONE AND TO

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.693
DO IT BY REGION TO ME JUST

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.394
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:00.629
FRANKLY IT ALWAYS ENDS UP

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:01.597
HITTING THE CENTRAL ALLEY THAT

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.599
YOU GOT IT. YOU GET NOTHING IN

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.234
YOU'VE GOT TO CONSERVE TO BUT IN

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.170
REGARDS TO YOUR PARTICULAR. BELL

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:09.905
HERE'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.540
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT ALL

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:13.542
THE WATER AGENCY OR ARE OPPOSED

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:16.011
AND I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:19.548
CONCERNS. IF YOU DO A PER CAPITA

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:23.518
- ANALYSIS THEN THE P. THE

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:26.655
RESIDENCES THAT TO AFFECT THE

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:29.191
MOST ARE THOSE THAT ARE THE

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.593
POOREST AND IT'S BECAUSE IF

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:36.231
YOU'RE POOR. AND YOU ON. BUT IN

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:37.666
MY REGION IF YOU'RE POOR AND

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.434
YOUR AN AGRICULTURAL WORKER YOU

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:43.472
USUALLY HAVE. MANY MANY ADULTS

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:45.908
LIVING IN IN THAT UNIT AND SO

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:47.276
THERE'S A SOME SHINS THAT THE

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:49.912
WATER COMPANIES USE THAT SAY

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.313
THERE'S TWO ADULTS AND TWO

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.915
CHILDREN RIGHT IN IT IN A TWO

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:56.451
BEDROOM. UNIT IN IN IN MY REGION

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:58.053
ARE EXPERIENCES THAT COULD BE

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.555
TEN ADULTS AND FOUR CHILDREN AND

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.724
SO YOU GET A WATER ALLOCATION

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:05.627
AND IF YOU IF YOU USE MORE THAN

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:07.529
THAT YOU GET. A PENALTY.

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:09.131
ANYTHING OVER THAT ALLOCATION

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:10.933
YOU PAY MORE FOR AND SO THE

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:13.368
REGION WHEN WE DID THIS PER

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:15.971
CAPITA ANALYSIS OR ARE IN

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:19.574
POSITION. THE LAST DROUGHT. IN

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:22.611
IN MY AREA THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.379
REALLY HURT WHERE WERE THE

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:27.149
POOREST AND SO I'M I'M VERY

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:29.284
CONCERNED WITH WITH HOW THIS

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:31.687
GETS- DETERMINED WE LEAVE IT UP

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:33.021
TO THE WATER WE TELL THEM THIS

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:34.656
IS WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO WE

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:37.292
LEAVE IT UP TO THE WATER COMPANY

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:38.860
AND IT WAS. ABOUT IN MY MIND IT

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:40.095
WAS- ABUSIVE ABUSIVELY USED

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:42.731
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY FOR

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:46.868
PEOPLE TO FILE A APPEAL. FOR TO

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.870
KNOW WHAT THEY COULD DO IF THEY

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.006
WERE ASSESSED A HIGHER WATER

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:53.408
RATES UP BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.477
THAT THE COMPANY HAD SET UP

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:57.479
THEIR PROGRAM. AND THE STATE

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.915
DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO GO BACK AND

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:01.383
TELL THEM YOU YOU DETRIMENTALLY

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.019
HURT POOR PEOPLE IN- IN

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:05.454
IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM AND SO

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.423
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT SO

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:09.358
THAT'S- AYE THAT'S MY BIGGEST

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:10.559
CONCERN ABOUT IT WE NEED TO BE

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:13.128
FAIR- AND HOPEFULLY THIS

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:16.264
LEGISLATURE WILL LOOK AT. MORE

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:21.703
BROADER SOLUTIONS. ABSOLUTELY NO

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.905
QUESTION WE HAVE TO CONSERVE-

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:25.841
AND SOME AREAS ARE DOING A

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.476
REALLY GOOD JOB BUT WE ALSO NEED

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:28.710
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:31.313
DIFFERENCES IN- IN RESIDENTIAL

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.781
YOU UNITS AND NOT ALL OF THEM

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:35.484
ARE EQUAL SO. THANK YOU WITHOUT

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.519
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT I BOUGHT

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:41.456
. THANK YOU SENATOR TARA. THANK

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:43.925
YOU MISTER CHAIR I TO WAS NOT

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:45.594
GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE BUT

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.262
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:48.830
WORKING ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:50.866
ALL THE IMPACTS THAT. AND THE

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:53.835
SHORTAGES OF WATER THAT WE HAVE

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:55.771
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND-

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.672
BILLION I WANT TO SPEAK TO IT.

01:17:57.739 --> 01:17:59.641
IN IN TERMS OF THE BIG PICTURE

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.543
RIGHT I THINK THIS IS. THE

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:03.345
GREATEST CHALLENGE FACING

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:06.481
MANKIND TODAY. WATER SCARCITY

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:09.618
WATER SECURITY. YOU SEE WATER

01:18:09.684 --> 01:18:11.620
SECURITY MEANS MUCH MORE THAN

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:15.223
JUST WATER AND WATER SECURITY IS

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.426
NOT JUST ABOUT CANALS OR STORAGE

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:22.097
ISSUES- EVEN THOUGH IT IS A HUGE

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.966
PART OF IT. OUR WATER SECURITY

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:28.904
IS ALSO A HUMAN SECURITY ISSUE.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.373
IMPACTS OF POOR WATER MANAGEMENT

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.075
IN CALIFORNIA THREATEN THE

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:35.077
SAFETY AND WELLBEING OF ALL

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:38.880
PEOPLE. I'M MORE CONCERNING IT

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:41.283
THREATENS OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:43.318
VERY OWN EXISTENCE. LET ME SAY

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:47.522
THAT AGAIN POOR WATER MANAGEMENT

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:50.325
THREATENS OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:54.196
VERY OWN EXISTENCE. WATER

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:57.666
INSECURITY CAN AND WILL LEAD TO

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.301
SOCIAL DISRUPTION IF LEFT

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:01.803
UNFIXED AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING I

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:03.371
JUST KIND OF THREW OUT THERE

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:05.273
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY. I

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.643
WAS PUT IN IN THE MOST RECENT-

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:13.081
IPCC REPORT BACK IN FEBRUARY.

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:15.484
AND SO WE MUST DO EVERYTHING

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:17.486
THAT WE CAN TO MAKE THIS MOMENT

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:19.020
. ABOUT WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:21.890
AT WATER BEYOND CALIFORNIA AND

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:24.059
YES CONSERVATIONISTS. BUT PART

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:26.895
OF IT. BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.597
LOOK AT THE OTHER WAYS THAT WE

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:30.165
MUST PROTECT THE LIMITED WATER

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:34.236
THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE THAT IS

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:35.971
ALSO ON THE LINE AND I WANT TO

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:38.573
BE ABLE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE ONE

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.375
OF THE REPORTS THAT CAME OUT

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.276
BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE. ON THE

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:44.012
GLOBAL WATER SECURITY- THE STATE

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.714
AT EIGHT IT CONFIRM THREE

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.949
DIFFERENT THINGS ONE WATER MAYBE

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:49.618
POTENTIALLY USED AS LEVERAGE

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:51.853
OVER NEIGHBORS TO PRESERVE WATER

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.890
INTEREST TO WATER MAY BE USED AS

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:56.024
A WEAPON WITH SOME UPSTREAM

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.559
NATIONS IMPEDING OR CUTTING OFF

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:59.794
DOWNSTREAM. FLOW TO PRESSURE

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:02.497
POPULATIONS OR SUPPRESS THEM.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.232
THREE WATER MAY BE USED AS A

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:06.268
FORM OF TERRORISM. PHYSICAL

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:09.204
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE DAMS WILL

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.106
BECOME TARGETS OF TERRORIST. NOW

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.874
I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE A

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:14.576
HOLLYWOOD. LIKE A SCARY

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.712
HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. BUT THE REALITY

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:20.282
IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.250
A VERY MUCH VERY MUCH A REALITY

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:26.955
HERE AT HOME. AND IT'S- SOMEWHAT

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:29.691
VIDEO TERRORIST ATTEMPTS ARE

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:32.460
ALREADY OCCURRING QUIETLY IN THE

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:35.130
FORM OF CYBER ATTACKS ON ALL

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:39.601
THINGS WATER. WATER IS BEING

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:42.003
USED AS LEVERAGE AT THIS POINT

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.838
AND I WANTED. EXPLAIN A LITTLE

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:49.144
BIT AND WHAT THAT MEANS. JUST

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:51.880
LAST YEAR THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:53.915
ONE OF OUR WATER TREATMENT

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:56.184
SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:57.552
THERE ARE CHEMICALS USED TO

01:20:57.619 --> 01:21:00.288
TREAT WATER WERE JUST TO DEBT

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.290
LEVELS BY A HACKER. FORTUNATELY

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:03.658
THAT THE ADJUSTMENTS WERE

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.894
NOTICED BEFORE ANYONE FELL ILL

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:08.730
AND WATER WAS CONTAMINATED. NOW

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.565
WITH THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:12.567
RUSSIA IS USING CYBER THREATS AS

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.970
A FORM OF LEVERAGE IN MY OPINION

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:20.008
THEY HAVE. ARE THERE WAS A- AB.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:21.676
THERE'S BEEN EFFORTS IN THE WE

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:23.612
GOT TO REALLY LOOK AT ALL THINGS

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:25.247
WATER WHEN IT COMES TO THE CYBER

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:26.948
ATTACK ATTEMPTS. AND I WANNA

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:29.417
GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN TWENTY

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:32.120
THIRTEEN IT. A UKRAINIAN HACKER.

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:35.423
ENTERED INTO THE COMMAND CONTROL

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:36.992
SYSTEM OF A DOWN IN THE STATE OF

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.027
NEW YORK. LUCKILY THE GATE HAD

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:41.296
BEEN MANUALLY DISCONNECTED FOR

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:44.132
MAINTENANCE THAT DAY. HAD IT NOT

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.801
THE DAM WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:21:46.868 --> 01:21:49.404
RELEASED SO WE TALK ABOUT WATER

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:52.140
CONVERT AT CONSERVATION I AGREE

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.609
WE REALLY NEED TO WE NEED TO

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:57.345
QUANTIFY WATER IN ALL SENSES

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:58.847
RIGHT AND INCLUDING THE

01:21:58.913 --> 01:22:00.915
CONSUMPTION THAT WE- THAT THAT

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:04.419
WE WANT TO USE IN OUR OWN HOMES

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.720
I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S PART OF

01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:09.291
IT BUT I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.959
BE VERY. CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:17.666
ABOUT. HOW WE APPROACH IT THE

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:19.534
ISSUES THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.102
WHEN IT COMES TO WATER BE WE

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:24.606
SHOULD BE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON.

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:25.874
THE LEAKAGES THAT ARE ALREADY

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.109
EXISTED AND THAT'S WHY I YOU

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:29.944
KNOW I SPONSORED SENATE BILL

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:31.179
FIVE FIVE NINE BECAUSE IT WOULD

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:32.480
ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL WATER TO GO

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:33.815
DOWN AND ACROSS THROUGHOUT THE

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.450
ENTIRE STATE. YES A RUN THROUGH

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:37.152
THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT THIRTY

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:38.420
ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS RELY ON

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:40.555
THAT THAT'S ADDITIONAL A FIX

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:42.524
THAT'S ADDITIONAL WATER MOVED

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.159
FOR MORE PEOPLE. FOR MORE

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:47.595
COMMUNITIES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.964
I SEE THAT AS A FORM OF

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:53.868
CONSERVATION. AND SO. I THINK

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:56.671
CYBER SECURITY ALSO IT'S

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:59.641
PREVENTATIVE RIGHT TO PROTECT

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:02.377
THE WATER THE VERY LIMITED WATER

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:03.578
THAT WE HAVE TODAY. I THINK WE

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:06.214
GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL THESE

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:08.917
THINGS BEFORE WE EVEN GO AND ASK

01:23:08.983 --> 01:23:11.453
. PAUL WHO ARE ALREADY LIMITED

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:14.356
ON WATER TO LIMIT EVEN MORE. AND

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:16.591
WE HAVE A AND I'M JUST THINKING

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:17.892
ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT I

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:19.027
REPRESENT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:20.195
WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:22.697
HUNDRED AND THREE DEGREES. SOME

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:25.367
COMMUNITIES GO WITHOUT WATER OUR

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.802
AND WATER IS JUST KINDA EIGHT

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:30.905
NEEDED TO LIVE AND TO SURVIVE SO

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:32.841
IMAGINE HAVING TO ASK A

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:34.075
COMMUNITY THAT HAS GONE WITHOUT

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.810
WATER OR HAS VERY LIMITED WATER

01:23:35.877 --> 01:23:38.446
IN THE EXTREME HEAT OF THE

01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:39.981
CENTRAL VALLEY. ASKING THEM TO

BE YOU KNOW TO- CONSERVE MORE I

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:44.686
JUST. I THINK IT COULD BE IT

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:46.554
COULD BE A LITTLE UNFAIR WE

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:47.722
GOTTA THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:49.557
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE MUST DO

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:52.227
MORE. AND I THINK WE CAN DO MORE

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:54.195
BUT WE GOT TO GET IT. WE GOTTA

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:57.098
GET IT RIGHT. SO I WILL BE NOT

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:58.800

ON THE FLOOR- IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:18.887

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:54.442
VERY CLEAN INDIVIDUALS THEY CARE

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:56.711
DEEPLY ABOUT THE WAY THEIR HOUSE

FROM FRESNO MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:15.930
HEMA PUT FORTH THAT BILL TO

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:18.032
ALREADY USE. WATER RESOURCES

01:27:18.099 --> 01:27:19.334
THAT WERE ALREADY ALLOCATED BY

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.135
THE VOTERS IN ORDER TO BUILD

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:24.238
WATER STORAGE IT WAS SHOT DOWN

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:24.906
IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE AS IT WAS

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:26.774
STATED EARLIER. I CAN TELL YOU

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:27.976
THERE'S NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:30.311
ON AL FLOWS INTO THE DELTA WERE

01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:31.546
MORE WATER CAN BE SENT TO THE

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:34.282
CENTRAL VALLEY- IN. THESE

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:36.351
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NOT HAPPEN

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:38.353
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER ALREADY

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:40.788
WOULD HAVE WATER. I CAN TELL YOU

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:42.457
THAT REPRESENTING. WITH MY

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:44.092
COLLEAGUES FROM FRESNO THE TOP

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:45.226
THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:48.296
THE WORLD THAT I REALIZE THIS IS

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:50.031
AN IN HOME ISSUE. BUT WE NEED

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.799
WATER TO GROW FOOD. TOP THREE

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:53.534
FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:55.503
ENTIRE WORLD AND LIKE I SAID I

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:56.804
KNOW THIS BILL DOESN'T AFFECT

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:58.640
THAT. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.341
ALL NEED CONSERVATION BECAUSE WE

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:01.876
CANNOT CONSERVE OUR WAY OUT OF

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:04.045
THIS SITUATION. SO ITMAKES ME

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:06.147
SICK TO MY STOMACH THAT WATER IS

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:08.750
JUST A VOLATILE POLITICAL ISSUE.

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.885
WE SHOULD ALL COME TOGETHER. AND

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.954
WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND MAKE SURE

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:15.356
THAT. EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:17.659
HAS A RIGHT TO WATER INCLUDING

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:18.660
THOSE IMPORTER BILL THAT HAVE

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:20.828
NOT HAD WATER IN ALMOST TWO AND

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:22.597
A HALF YEARS. THE GO TO THE

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:25.466
DITCH TO GET WATER TO BRING BACK

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:27.168
TO THEIR HOUSE TO WASH CLOTHES.

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:29.103
IF YOU WERE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.171
TO THE FARMWORKERS IN THE

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:31.706
CENTRAL VALLEY THOUSANDS OF THEM

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:33.641
WOULD TELL YOU. THAT THE BIGGEST

01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.109
STRUGGLE THEY HAVE IS SOME OF

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:37.045
THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:37.879
THIS BUILDING THAT CREATE MORE

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:42.150
COST FOR THEM. THIS BILL IS

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:42.784
EXACTLY LIKE THIS NO MATTER HOW

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:44.819
WELL INTO IT IT IS. WE

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:45.853
DEFINITELY WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.822
RIGHT ASK YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THE

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:48.890
BILL THAT WAS BROUGHT FORTH BY

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.091
MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:50.758
ENTERTAINMENT. SO THAT WE COULD

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.427
ACTUALLY LOOK AT ALLOCATING

AND CERTAINLY REFLECTING THE

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:34.135
IMPORTANCE OF THIS CRITICAL

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.704
ISSUE IN ALL CORNERS OF THE

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:38.539
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I KNOW

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:39.841
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT ARGUED

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.776
INVOLVING FIRES AND PROP ONE BUT

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:44.145
IS- CENTER FROM RIVERSIDE SAID

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:45.747
THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:48.015
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE HAD A

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:49.083
BILL UP. SO TO SPEAK DEALING

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:51.152
WITH MILES PER GALLON TO BE ABLE

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:52.019
TO INCREASE THE MILEAGE OF

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.788
AUTOMOBILES. THE FOLKS AND SAY

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:55.456
NO WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:57.291
GOT TO GET INTERNAL COMBUSTION

01:29:57.358 --> 01:30:00.027
ENGINES OFF THE- OFF THE ROAD.

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:02.597
CERTAINLY IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART

01:30:02.663 --> 01:30:05.333
OF THE LARGER CONTEXT BUT IT IS

01:30:05.399 --> 01:30:06.634
NOT THE CORE OF THIS BILL. THE

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:08.703
QUESTION I AS AND I WANT TO

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.938
JUST THE POVERTY ISSUE IN SOME

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:11.939
OF THESE OTHER ISSUES I THINK

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.040
ARE IMPORTANT BUT BASICALLY.

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:14.675
WHAT IF WE DIDN'T CONSERVE

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:17.011
VERSIONS WE GET CONSERVE WATER

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:18.980
FOR RIGHT PERSONS WERE WRONG.

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:21.549
YOU FOR ME FOR WRONG THE WORST

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.985
CASE SCENARIO IS. THAT WE HAVE

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:26.420
MORE WATER TO GROW MORE FOOD IN

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:28.022
THE STATE WHERE AGRICULTURE IS

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:30.725
SO IMPORTANT HE FOR WRONG WILL

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:31.859
HAVE MORE WATER FOR THE

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:33.628
ENVIRONMENT. THEN THE FISHY SO

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:35.029
MANY OTHER THINGS THAT MEET THE

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:37.131
DISCUSSION OF THE CHALLENGES

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.733
THAT WE FACE. OKAY WONDERFUL

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.836
RIGHT WHAT IF THIS WAS SUGGESTED

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:42.870
BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WE DO

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:45.139
RUN OUT OF WATER WE DON'T HAVE

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:46.741
ENOUGH THAT WE NEED TO GET AHEAD

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:49.010
OF THE GAME IS THE CHAIR OF THE

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:49.744
WATER COMMITTEE SAID TO GET

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:51.746
AHEAD OF THIS PROCESS AND TO BE

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.748
SMART ABOUT IT RIGHT SO WHAT IS

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:55.783
THE IMPACT WHAT ARE WE REALLY

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.251
TALKING ABOUT HERE IS BECAUSE WE

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:58.619
ARE MEETING THOSE GOALS LET ME

01:30:58.686 --> 01:31:00.688
LET ME JUST ADDRESS A COUPLE OF

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:02.423
ISSUES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEM

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.659
I WON'T TAKE TOO MUCH TIME OKAY

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:07.762
NUMBER ONE COST IMPACT ON PEOPLE

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.198
OF LESSER MEANS A TWO THOUSAND

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:11.199
EIGHTEEN STUDY BY THE ALLIANCE

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:12.967
FOR WATER EFFICIENCY FOUND THAT

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.335
THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.571
WATER AND POWER CONSERVE THE

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:19.006
CONSERVATION PROGRAM AVOID THE

01:31:19.073 --> 01:31:20.641
BILL ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.977
WATER COST CONSUMER BILLS

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:25.913
CUSTOMERS BILLS 426% LOWER THAN

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.315
THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:29.483
IN TERMS OF IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:33.254
LESSER MEANS WATER COSTS. SECOND

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:36.424
THE IDEA. OF LOOKING AT THIS

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:38.459
HOLISTICALLY AND SAYING LESS

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.194
WATER PER PERSON WHAT IS A

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:42.363
GALLON PER. PER CAPITA PER DAY

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:44.198
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:45.233
STANDARDS WHAT YOU'RE REQUIRED

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:47.602
TO LOOK AT HERE. IS IT'S NOT

01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:50.204
CHEST. URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:52.373
RETAIN THE EXISTING FLEXIBILITY

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.407
UNDER THIS BILL IT'S IMPORTANT

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:55.443
TO NOTE. O MEET THEIR WATER

01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:57.445
OBJECTIVES. CALCULATED BY THE

01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:59.413

ADJUSTMENTS WHICH IS

01:32:20.768 --> 01:32:22.036
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ORANGE

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:23.938
COUNTY WHICH IN MY JUDGMENT HAS

01:32:24.005 --> 01:32:25.873

FEET THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:34.015
BUSINESS. AND SO THE CHALLENGES

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:35.983
I WILL TALK TO THE SENATOR FROM

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.084
IRVINE ABOUT BECAUSE I'VE SPENT

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:38.986
A LOT OF TIME STUDYING THIS. SO

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.588
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:42.490
IN TERMS OF CONSERVATION CAN WE

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:44.725
DO IT. I WILL GO THROUGH THE

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:45.826
DETAILS BECAUSE WE'RE OUT OF

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.828
TIME BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS YES

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.730
WE CAN YES WE CAN. THE BOTTOM

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:53.000
LINE IS THAT. ARE THIS REALLY IS

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:55.236
ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION THIS

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.170
REALLY IS ABOUT YOUR

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.972
GRANDCHILDREN THIS REALLY IS

01:32:58.039 --> 01:33:00.107
ABOUT GOVERNING NOT FOR THE NEXT

01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:00.908
ELECTION. BUT FOR THE NEXT

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:02.710
GENERATION THAT IS WHAT WE'RE

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:05.313
TRYING TO DO HERE TO GET AHEAD

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.814
OF THE CURVE. FOR SOMETHING

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:08.316
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT IN THE

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:09.617
COMMUTER URBAN COMMITTEES I

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:11.352
REPRESENT LOS ANGELES THERE'S

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.119
NOT A NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL THAT

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:13.688
I CAN'T GO TO. THE DOESN'T TALK

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:15.356
ABOUT WATER BECAUSE WE IMPORT

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.224
WATER AND WE HAVE TO LOS

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:18.926
ANGELES. ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT'S

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:20.328
HAPPENING AT THE COLORADO RIVER

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:22.563
STE WE ALREADY OVER DREW OUR OUR

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:24.498
ALLOCATION BY NINE HUNDRED

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:26.067
THOUSAND ACRE FEET. TO REDUCE

01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:27.335
OUR DEMAND TO REDUCE OUR DEMAND

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.703
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR THE

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:33.808
ENVIRONMENT FOR AGRICULTURE SO.

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:34.842
IF WE DO REDUCE OUR DEMAND WE

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:37.144
HAVE A LARGER PICTURE. OF WHAT

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:38.779
WE'RE HERE. IT'S NOT A BAD THING

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:40.481
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:41.148
TECHNOLOGICALLY ISRAEL WHAT DID

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:43.484
THEY DO. GEISHA'S SYSTEM WHAT DO

01:33:43.551 --> 01:33:45.987
YOU DO IN AGRICULTURE RFID RADIO

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:48.222
FREQUENCY TAGS ACTUALLY THE TREE

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:49.690
AND TELL YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:51.492
NEEDS. TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.861
BRILLIANT ACROSS THE GLOBE TO BE

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.730
ABLE TO DEAL WITH WATER IN A

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:57.398
MUCH MORE ELEGANT WAY. THAN HOW

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:58.766
WE'RE DEALING WITH IT IT IS SO

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.701
IMPORTANT IS A HUMAN RIGHT IT IS

01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:02.303
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT A

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:05.139
MOLDED FOLKS TO STAND TODAY. AND

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:06.874
SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS AN

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:08.642
IMPORTANT BILL I THINK IT'S

01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:10.745
