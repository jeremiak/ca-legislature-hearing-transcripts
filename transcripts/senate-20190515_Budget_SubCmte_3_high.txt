I THINK YOU. ANYONE ELSE START SEE NO ONE ELSE AT THE MICROPHONE -- WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND THIS MOVE ON THE ISSUE NUMBER TWO RESTORATION OF THE 7% ACROSS THE BOARD REDUCTION. BY CONTINUING THE GOVERNOR'S A JANUARY PROPOSAL TO RESTORE THE THE 7% -- THERE'S ADDITIONAL MONEY REQUIRED AS A PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO GROW THE THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THAT 7% REQUIRES A SLIGHTLY MORE MONEY TO TO BUY IT OUT. AND AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO SUSPEND THE REDUCTION FROM ACTUALLY OCCURRING IN BUDGET YEAR -- REMAINS UNCHANGED. YOU L. L.. AS WAS NOTED IN THE AGENDA -- IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR DID PROPOSE IN ADDITION TO RESTORING IT IN THE BUDGET YEAR -- TO RESTORE THE SERVICE HOURS ON AN ONGOING BASIS HOWEVER IN MAY WHILE ON THE RESTORATION IS STILL TRUE IN THE BUDGET YEAR THE POLICY POSITION IS THAT IT WOULD BE TEMPORARY AND SUNSET -- JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO IT WOULD BE THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE RAISE GENERAL COMMENTS AROUND THIS APPROACH THAT WOULD APPLY TO ISSUES THAT YOU'LL HEAR LATER ON TODAY ABOUT THESE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY ONGOING COSTA NATURE'S PROGRAMMATIC COMMITMENTS -- AND GENERAL ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO THE BUDGET HERE MAY NOT REFLECT -- ONGOING ACTUAL COSTS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU FINANCE. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAYOR VISION PROPOSAL AS TO SUNSET THE RESTORATION DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS DUE TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED REVENUE. OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD AN ONGOING EFFORTS TO CONTAIN PROGRAM COSTS AS I AGE ASSESSES ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. HE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES CENTER STONE. YEAH [inaudible] HE I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SUNSET DATE TODAY. THERE'S A QUESTION WE HAVE A A GROWING NEED FOR HSS -- I'M A PART OF THE SILVER SONORA RIGHT NOW I DON'T FORESEE MYSELF I MEAN TO USE AYE HSS BUT THERE'S A GROWING POPULATION THAT NEEDS NEEDS THAT -- I THINK THAT THIS SUNSET -- SENDS A A LOT OF FEAR TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT. DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF KEEPING OUR SENIOR CITIZENS OUT OF COSTLY HOMES [inaudible] AND YES THAT THE REVENUE STREAMS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT -- TO COME IN. AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN CERTAINLY -- LOOK AT IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR BUT TO PUT THIS IN HERE I THINK IS SENDING A SHOCKWAVE. TO THE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. BASICALLY GET PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE. YOU KNOW. AND YOU KNOW. WHAT KIND OF A MESSAGE DOES THE GOVERNOR WANT TO SOUND TOO I. H. S. WORKERS WHEN WE HAVE A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR? WE SHOULD EVALUATE THE PROGRAM EVERY YEAR BASED ON IS MERITS BASED ON REVENUE COMING IN BASED ON THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES IN THIS POTENTIAL SAVINGS OF THE STATE TO INVEST IN I HSS. WHY ARE WE PUTTING THIS IN HERE AND BASICALLY CHECKING THE FOUNDATION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK TO LIVE AND WHY ARE WE JUST GONNA DRESSES NEXT YEAR IN IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I THINK WHITES GOVERNOR SETTING SUCH A SHOCKING MESSAGE TO A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE. GETTING AT THE LIGHTS TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE -- IN DESPERATE NEED OF THESE SERVICES. APOLOGIES I WOULD SAY DEAR QUESTIONS REALLY THIS IS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BUILDING A STRUCTURE AND BUDGET. AND I WOULD KNOW AND THIS BUDGET YEAR WE ARE PROPOSING TO CONTINUE RESTORING THE 7% TO THE TUNE OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. AND AS THIS IS AN OUT GOING OUT YEAR PROPOSAL THERE IS OPPORTUNITY. FARK ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. NO AND I UNDERSTAND AND THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING A BUDGET YEAR AFTER YEAR -- TO TO VALUE WAIT THE THE THE NEEDS OF A PROGRAM THE REVENUE COMING INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SEEMS AS THOUGH -- WE CUT. THE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE THE MOST NEEDED SERVICES INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIAN I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S NOT A VERY BOLD AMBITIOUS PLAN. HE WANTS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX IN IN THIS BUDGET AND HE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR IN THE STATE OF THE STATE THAT YOU WANT TO DO THE SAME THING FOR ALL AGES. IT IS -- HIS PHILANTHROPY. ARE WE NOT DOING IT ON THE BACKS OF PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE MOST HILL -- CONSTITUENTS. THE BUDGET IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PRIORITY. OF OUR NEEDS IN THE STATE AND IT REPRESENTS OUR VALUES HOW DOES THE GOVERNOR VALUE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN FIRM AT HOME AND NEED CARE. AGAIN I WOULD REITERATE THIS IS THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US WE ARE PROPOSING A BUDGET YEAR. TO RESTORE THE 7% AND THIS IS THE SITE PROPOSED ON SIZE PART OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN THIS IS NICELY BUT AYE AYSHA SAYS IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING PROGRAMS AND SAID THIS IS A WAY FOR US TO LOOK AT COSTS AND TO MAKE SURE. WE ARE HAVING A STRUCTURALLY SOUND BUDGET AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IF YOU'RE BALANCING WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE FUTURE BUDGETS ON THE BACKS OF THOSE THAT CANNOT CHAMPION THESE ISSUES FOR THEMSELVES. IN THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I'M GONNA BE QUIZZING YOU TODAY ABOUT A CENSUS BECAUSE OUR SUNSETS ON MANY PROGRAMS. THAT I CAN TELL YOU IN A BIPARTISAN WAY PEOPLE ARE VERY ANGRY ABOUT IT. AND WE NEED TO LOOK FOR THE GOVERNOR KNOW THAT. IT'S ABOUT TAKING CARE OF THOSE A CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND WE SHOULD BE PUTTING THESE ARBITRARY -- SUNSETS AND PROGRAMS AT IN FIGHTING FOR RESTORATION FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO COME. I'M NOT TRYING TO KILL THE MESSENGER ARTIST -- PROCEDURE SENDING MY MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNOR THAT I THINK IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. IS THERE STONE -- I TO SHARE CENTER SENS CONCERN IN LA IS CONCERNED -- IS REALLY APPRECIATE I RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THE BUDGET ITSELF IS A ONE YOUR DOCUMENT -- BUT I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK OUT AT OUT YEARS. BUT I WOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT -- ON THE 7% CUT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION. ALRIGHT SO. THIS IS THE RESTORATION OF THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WERE SAYING THAT WILL BE MADE THE CUT. WHEN I BRING IT BACK BUT THEN WE'RE GONNA CUT YOU AGAIN? ABOUT THE FUTURE TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCE OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WILL WHEN THAT TIME COMES. I STILL HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT BUT I'M NOT SURE YEAH I I DON'T AGREE WITH BUILDING IT IN. INTO THE MECHANISM CLEARLY YOU KNOW IN OUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BUDGET OF COURSE KNOWING TO LOOK AT THIS YOU WANNA SEE OUT YOUR IMPACTS -- BUT I THINK AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ONLY THE AGING POPULATION WE HAVE A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE LIVING -- WITH. DISABILITIES WHO NEED TO SUPPORT SO THEY CAN LEAD -- PRODUCTIVE AND LIVES WERE THERE -- THAT. THE IDEA THAT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. WORKING IN THE FIELD AND ALSO PEOPLE MIGHT CONSIDER WORKING IN THE FIELD RIGHT. NO THAT WE BUILT IN A 7% CUT. AND HAVING THE ISLANDS THAT UNCERTAINTY WHAT WILL REALLY HAPPEN I MEAN I THINK THEY HAVE BUT IT ALWAYS THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ASSUME OF THE BILL THE SEND THAT THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. RIGHT I MEAN WE MAY NOT ACTUALLY DO IT WHEN THE TIME COMES THE PENDING WHAT'S ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. END OF THE ECONOMIC SERVES AS A POOR ME MAY EVEN DECIDE HOPEFULLY NOT -- YOU'LL HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WHAT WE PRIORITIES WHAT ELSE WE YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE COTTON THE OTHER BIGGER CUTS THAT WE LOOK AT IN DIFFERENT PLACES -- BUT I AM YOU KNOW I I SHARE WITH LA IS CONCERNED AT THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S AN ONGOING PROGRAM IT'S IT'S NOT A ONE TIME SO THAT KIND OF TREATING THIS IS A ONE TIME. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY SENDS THE WRONG SIGNAL AND AND ACTUALLY UNDERMINES OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES BECAUSE WE'RE TELLING THE PEOPLE WHO. MAY BE GOING INTO THIS PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THE NEED FOR THE PROGRAM DOESN'T CHANGE AND YES IT IS ONE THE FASTEST GROWING PROGRAMS. I WOULD POINT OUT THOUGH THE ALTERNATIVES. THE ALTERNATIVE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS NOT THAT THE PEOPLE DISAPPEAR. NOTHING DID NEED DISAPPEARS IT GETS PUSHED AND OTHER PLACES IN FACT. I BELIEVE LA YOU LOOKED AT THIS RATE I MEAN THE ALTERNATIVE IS WE INSTITUTIONALIZE PEOPLE. AND THEN WHO PAYS FOR MOST OF THAT WELL ACTUALLY INTERESTING NO THOUGHT TO US AGAIN RATE NURSING HOME CARE AT THE DELTA KERR DAT UNDR MEDICARE AL. AND SO ACTUALLY [inaudible] IT. THE WHO'S US ACTUALLY TO FIGURE HOW WE SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM SO WE CAN NOT OF SO ACTUALLY IS A BUDGET EVEN DUMBER BUDGET COMMITTEE CELL I MEAN THERE'S A POLICY ISSUE EVEN FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT. I REALLY DO WONDER -- INURED LONG TERM ANALYSIS DID YOU FACTOR IN THE FACT THATOKAY WE DO A 7% CUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED THEN TO THE SERVICES. AND THEN HOW MUCH OF A SHIFT WE NOW HAVE FROM HSS TO OTHER PROGRAMS AT THE STATE ALSO TO PAY FOR AND HOW COST EFFECTIVE THOSE ARE -- SO I I CERTAINLY -- IN A WOULD APPRECIATE -- BEFORE I WOULD CERTAINLY EVEN ENTERTAIN LOOKING AT THIS -- AGREEING TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'D LIKE TO SEE AN ANALYSIS. THAT SHOWS THAT EVEN FROM A PURELY FINANCIAL PLAIN VIEW ALTHOUGH AGAIN THE SHE'S NOT JUST FINANCIAL AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES. EVEN FINANCIAL VIEW CAN YOU ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT THIS ACTUALLY WOULD WORK THIS ACTUALLY REDUCES OUR OUTGOING SPENDING MY GUESS IS IT MIGHT ACTUALLY NOT LET YOU PRETEND LIKE THIS. NEEDS TO STOP. YOU KNOW DISAPPEAR MAN I THINK THAT'S AN UNWARRANTED ASSUMPTION. SO -- HOPEFULLY -- THE A JOB FOR BY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR AND ALSO THE OVERALL IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT SUNSET ON ON GOING SERVICES I MEAN WITH A SEVEN OZ CONVERSATION WE WANT THE SERVICES OR NOT. YES WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE OF YOUR COSTS WOULD BE SO. OKAY. IS IT IS IT ANY OF BY WAYS ANY IN AND SUCH ANALYSIS BEEN DONE AND AND FOR THIS PROPOSAL. AS I SUGGESTED. ONE THE ANALYSIS WAS THE MAYOR REVISION FORECAST WHICH IS NOT PROTECTING A RECESSION BUT IN MY MIND RECESSION COVERS ALL AND REVENUE DECLINES OF NATURE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHIFT TO THEN THE COST SHIFT THAT COULD HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS. THEY'RE LIKE INSIST. THIS WAS PACIFIC PLAY FOR THAT I AND JUST LAST COST AND THOSE OUT YEARS OKAY SO SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE IN SILOS. WE'RE NOT RECOGNIZING THE PEOPLE HAVE NEEDS. YOU KNOW WE COULD MAKE A POLICY CHOICE NOT TO MEET THEM. RECOGNIZE RIGHT LET'S LET'S E HONEST WITH PEOPLE THAN OKAY WE COULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. HE CAN AFFORD IT WE'RE NOT TO PROVIDE IT. OR SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT ARE A POLICY PROPOSALS AND COME OUT AND SAY THAT OTHERWISE THEN MY AND SAY WELL WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS BUT WHEN I GO FIGHT THIS WAY. THEN WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE IT AND THE COULD TURN OUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO I HOPE WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT THINGS IN SILOS. AND WE'RE BEING HONEST ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE REALLY PROPOSING? INCIDENT IN THESE PROPOSALS I RECOGNIZE THOSE CONCERNS OKAY THANK YOU. YES SAYS THERE'S NOTHING I'M GOING TO FALL APART I'M NOT SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS THAT -- DO WE ARBITRARILY. CUT BACK ON THE 7% UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SOME PEOPLE. TWO SIX SERVICES AND MORE INSTITUTIONALIZED SETTINGS SO INSTEAD OF SPENDING TWELVE BUCKS AN HOUR. ON HAVING A FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND OR YOU DEDICATED HEALTH CARE. PROVIDER -- PROVIDE THE SERVICES WERE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE SPENT -- WHICH IS A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE -- AVENUE -- I HSS IS A ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM IS A NOT. IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM WHICH MEANS WERE MANDATED BY LAW TO GIVE IT. CERTAINLY IF WE DON'T FIND IT APPROPRIATELY. WE CAN RATION IT. BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO EARN A LIVING WAGE I DON'T SUGGEST THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO PAY PEOPLE EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR SO THEY CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE TO DESPERATELY NEED THEM. BUT I THINK THE QUESTION WAS HAS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DONE A ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS TO KNOW THAT IF WE CAN EMBARK ON BUT NOT RESTORING THE FEE PERMANENTLY. AND THAT RESULTS IN A LOSS OF SERVICE. TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL WITH THE ALTERNATIVE COST. INSTITUTIONALIZING THOSE BE -- HAS JUST AS DEPARTMENT FINANCE DENNIS STUDY IN IF YOU HAVEN'T HAS A PHILLY -- DONE THAT STUDY. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUDGETS ON A MULTI YEAR AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AND OUR ANALYSIS TO ENSURE THAT IN THESE OUT YEARS WE ARE PRODUCING A STRUCTURALLY SOUND BUDGET. I WOULD DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE LA OKAY **** BUT BUT YOUR ANALYSIS IS FLAWED BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED YOU LOOK AT HOW YOUR BUDGETS AS DECLINING. BUT YOU DON'T LOOK AT YOUR OUT YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE MAINTAINED SO YOU HAVE A FLAWED ANALYSIS IN MY VIEW DEPARTMENT OF LA -- CAN YOU RESPOND. GINNY GIVE ME GINNY FELLOW WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS DOCTOR PAN INDICATED WE DID LOOK AT THIS YEARS AGO ACTUALLY AND IF THE CONTEXT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT. THE PROGRAM WAS QUITE DIFFERENT AT THE TIME. BUT THE READ THE PROPOSED REDUCTION WAS NEARLY A COMPLETE ELIMINATION THE PROGRAM ABOUT IT WAS LIKE NEARLY 87% REDUCTION. SO WE WERE REALLY LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING THE PROGRAM AND NOT AND DID FIND THAT. IT WAS COST EFFECTIVE TO THE STATE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM. AND THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE THE COUNTIES ALSO HAVE A SHARE AND IT'S NOT JUST. AS YOU SAID IT'S TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT THE STATURE OF THAT IS ACTUALLY MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KICKING IN AND THE COUNTIES. SO WE DID LOOK AT THAT WE HAVE NOT LOOKED AT SORT OF THIS MARGINAL THE 7% DECREASE IN I THINK OF THAT IT'S A BIT. OF A TRICK YOUR ANALYSIS TO DO BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN ALL OR NOTHING SO ASSUMING SOMEONE HAS TO GO INTO INSTITUTIONALIZED CARE TODAY -- NUMBER ONE WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF COST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WITH COLLECTIVELY WITH THE FEDERAL CONTRIBUTION WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IT I'M NOT HOLDING TO A FIGURE IS THE AVERAGE COST PER DAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SPELL PER DAY I'M NOT SURE ABOUT PER DAY. I THINK THAT AND I'M NOT ARE MEDI CAL PERSON BUT I NOTICED THE FEDS PAY ROUGHLY ABOUT 50% pAND I THINK A NURSING HOME COST AS UPWARDS OF SIXTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TOTAL BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE CLIENT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT I AGES US IS THAT IS A BIGGER BANG FOR THE BUCK IT'S LESS MONEY THERE'S OTHER EVEN SOMEONE'S IN IN. HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THEY MAY BE RECEIVING OTHER OTHER SERVICES AS WELL WHICH IS ALSO WHAT SORT OF LAYERS ON TOP OF THE TRICK UNITS OF THIS ANALYSIS IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE I JUST HAVE COSTS BUT THEN THEY ARE GETTING OTHER SERVICES BUT BUT I THINK. THAT'S A THAT'S A FAIR COMMENT THAT ON AVERAGE A PERSON IN I JUST US VERSES IN A NURSING HOME IS CHEAPER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- PUBLIC COMMENT. RESEARCHER MEMBERS TO ANYONE WITH THE CSU CALIFORNIA AND STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS PROPOSAL -- THIS TO YOUR SON SAID IS DEFINITELY A STEP BACK FROM THE JANUARY PROPOSAL AND I THINK IT CONTINUES TO LEAD DIETERS AS PROGRAM AS A WHOLE KNOW THAT THE NEEDS OF BOTH THE PROVIDERS AND THE CLIENTS ARE JUST. NOT IMPORTANT -- TO THE STATE WE CONTINUE TO COME BACK HERE YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WE WOULD MAINTAIN THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A PERMANENT RESTORATION TO THE 7% AND WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU HIGHLY CONSIDER -- EXCEPT AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO PERMANENTLY RESTORE THE 7% REDUCTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MARTY EMOTO CALIFORNIA DISPLACING YOUR COMMUNICATION NETWORK ALSO FAMILY MEMBER MY FAMILY HAD TO DEAL WITH ALL THESE KINDS OF CUTS BACK IN EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHEN MY SISTER WAS STILL ALIVE. FIRST OF ALL ADVOCATES IN THE PUBLIC CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN JANUARY WE'RE TOLD. THAT THE 7% RATE RESTORATION WOULD BE ONGOING AND THEN TOLL IN DANCING IN MAY REVISED STATEN FACT IT ISN'T AN INSULT INADVERTENTLY PEOPLE WERE MISLED AND THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO TO MOVE FORWARD ON ON ON POLICY MAKING NUMBER. TWO THERE'S A RAINY DAY FUND. AND WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF A RAINY DAY FUND IF NOT TO PROVIDE A CUSHION IF TEMPORARY. FOR SAFETY NET SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION HAS THE TIME TO MAKE MORE CAREFUL POLICY DECISIONS ON ON THE IMPACT OF CUTS OR REDUCTIONS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY. TO YOUR OR THREE YEARS NOW. LASTLY NUMBER THREE WE SHOULD MAKE REDUCTIONS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO. AND IT SHOULD BE DELIVERED OF THERE SHOULD BE A PROCESS WHERE ADVOCATES THE STATE AND LEGISLATURE CAN LOOK AT THE CUTS. PROPOSED IN REAL TIME WE SHOULD MAKE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DO CUTS AS IT IS DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW TO DO INCREASES THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN AND SENATOR STONE -- ONE ALIGN MYSELF WITH THOSE COMMENTS -- CHRISTINE ABOUT HIM ALTON WITH YOU W. REPRESENTING I JUST AS WORKERS -- EVERYTHING THAT IT HAS BEEN SAID 1100% CORRECT I AM URGING THE COMMITTEE TO STAND STRONG ON% THIS DOCTOR PAN WE HEARD THIS ISSUE LAST MONTH -- THE I IT'S BEING HELD OPEN BUT WE ARE. ON BEHALF OF YOU W. PLEASE. VOTE FOR THE PERMANENT RESTORATION OF THE 7% I WOULD KNOW TWO THINGS. THIS IS. ATTEMPTING TO BY PASS THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IF A REDUCTION IS NECESSARY DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN TWO YEARS WE SHOULD DELIBERATE THAT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A VOTE AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NORMALLY DO FOR CUTS. AND NUMBER TWO IN RESPONSE TO THE OBSERVATION THAT I JUST AS IS THE FASTEST GROWING PROGRAM WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT'S TRUE THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM AND IN FACT I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO ALSO ADOPT THE REQUEST FOR THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN THE WORK OF CREATING A WAY. TO INTERVENE WITH MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND DOWN AND BECOME HSS RECIPIENTS SO LET'S THINK HOLISTICALLY HERE THAT IF WE ARE TRYING TO CONTROL I JUST AS BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT THAN JUST THE REDUCING. THE ACCESS TO SERVICES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WELCOME -- CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND WE WERE VERY -- DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THE RETREAT IN THE MAY REVISE HOW AND THIS ISSUE I THINK FOR ALL OF THE REASONS BOTH -- YOU AND SENATOR STONE AT HAVE POINTED OUT -- AND I I I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT -- MY COLLEAGUES ARE MAKING AS THIS CREATES A PRESUMPTION THAT THIS IS WHERE REDUCTIONS WILL HAPPEN. IN TWO YEARS I GET IT THAT IT'LL BE SUBJECT TO DISCUSSIONS BUT AT THE STARTING POINT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE FROM THE PRESUMPTION. THAT THIS -- THAT THE INCREASE -- ROLL BACK WOULD BE THE STARTING POINT FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND THEN ONE LAST POINT ON THIS THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT -- RETREAT FROM WHAT IS THE STATE'S ONSTAD -- OBLIGATION AND SO THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE KEPT IN MIND THAT -- THAT WE HAVE A BROAD OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT IN EVERY PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE THAT -- THE PARTICIPANTS ARE LIVING WITHIN THEIR AT LEAST RESTRICTIVE -- ENVIRONMENT AND AND IN THEIR HOMES AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME LIBBY SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH. THE REQUEST ON BEHALF OF SEIU AND YOU D. W. TO MAKE THE 7% CUT REPEAL PERMANENT AND REALLY WANT TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION TO BOTH DOCTOR PAN AND SENATOR STONE FOR RAISING THE LINE OF QUESTIONING. REGARDING THE COSTS THE REAL COSTS THAT ARE BORN BY CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS IF THIS CAUGHT ISN'T FULLY WORKED STORED IT'S NOT JUST THE DE HUMANIZING CHOICES THAT ALL CONSUMERS HAVE TO MAKE BECAUSE THE ALLOCATION OF OURS IS BASED ON A NEAT. SO WHERE TO THOSE 77% OF OURS COME FROM BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION COSTS WHICH AS THE LA -- APPROPRIATELY POINTED OUT OF BETWEEN SIXTY AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HIGH OUR CONSUMERS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOSPITAL IS A AND THOSE COSTS CAN BE LIMITLESS. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE REQUEST TO THE COMMITTEE TO PERMANENTLY RESTORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. NANCY CHANCE CHOICES PERSON CENTERED SERVICES -- I HAPPEN TO WORK IN ONE OF THE OTHER SILOS -- IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES PIECE OF THINGS AND I JUST WANTED TO ECHO WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS SAD BUT ALSO TO SAY I I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE'S GOING TO BE A SCHOLARSHIP BECAUSE THE MINUTE SOMEBODY LOSES. HOURS AND I HSS AND THEY'RE IN SUPPORTED LIVING THAT. SUPPORTED LIVING BUDGET NEEDS TO BE INCREASED IS TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. AND IT I THINK IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN NOT BY A LOT BUT IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE SO GATHER WILL BE CAUTIOUS NOT JUST INSTITUTIONALIZATION BUT ALL KINDS OF SCHOLARSHIPS -- SO I OPPOSE THE SUNSET ON THE 7% THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY SEEING NO ONE ELSE -- AT I JUST. STRATA COULD FIRST OF ALL I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR BUDGET IN THE MONEY. FOR THIS YEAR -- SO I WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR THAT -- THAT'S AND ALSO AGREEMENT WITH THAT. THE ISSUE IS. VIEWING THIS IS AN ONGOING. PROGRAM AND AN ONGOING COMMITMENT AND I THINK YOU HEARD FROM TESTIMONY AT EIGHT THIS IS ACTUALLY OF ROLL BACK FROM. JANUARY. AND THAT'S VERY CONCERNING -- AND THINK YEAH WE AND WE'VE -- HAD CONVERSATIONS IN THIS VERY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT THINK ABOUT HOW WE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE RIGHT WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION WE ALSO HAVE. A LARGER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO -- FORTUNATELY -- ARE ABLE TO THE OTHERS WHO HAVE DISABILITIES OR A WHO WHO WITH THANKS TO THIS PROGRAM OTHER PROGRAMS -- ARE ABLE TO LIVE. IN AND LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT AND IN INDIA FOR CONTRIBUTING AND BE ABLE TO WORK ON JOBS DOING LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL. AND THIS. PROPOSAL TO SENSUALLY SAY IN TWO YEARS WE'RE GOING TO BE REMAIN THE CUT UNLESS OTHERWISE. I THINK SENDS A VERY NEGATIVE MESSAGE AND ALSO. DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S VISION FOR EXAMPLE HE HAS AGING TASK FORCE RIGHT AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF OUR SAFETY NET FOR FOR AN AGING POPULATION -- AND SO FORTH SO IT JUST SEEMS SO INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT ELSE THE GOVERNOR'S DOING SO CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW WILL. WELL -- I I HOPE THAT TO AN ANIMAL ONE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S VISION THE BUDGET GOVERNOR BUDGING FOR THIS YEAR. SIDES NO ONE RECOGNIZE THAT. BUT I I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AS WE TRY TO INCLUDE IN THE FINAL BUDGET. AND CLEARLY I CAN TELL WEEK WE WE DISAGREE WITH THIS PROPOSAL WILL -- THERE'S SOME CONSIDERATION BY THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT. HOW THIS REALLY SEEMS TO CONFLICT WITH -- THE VISION EXPRESSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS. OKAY THANK YOU. HI SO WILL NOT HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. ISSUE NUMBER THREE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION COUNTY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING. FEATURING A WITH THE DEPARTMENT AGAIN. AS A RESULT A FEDERAL STATUTE THAT THERE WAS PASSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO NOW WE WE'VE HAD A LONG ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN THE IN THE AYE% EXERCISE PROGRAM TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE COMPLY. WITH IT WITHOUT REQUIREMENT -- AFTER A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THEM A LOT OF DISCUSSION WITH THEM -- WE WE'VE ADOPTED A COMPLIANCE MECHANISM THROUGH OUR EXISTING -- ELECTRONIC SERVICES PORTAL -- AND ALSO A TELEPHONIC -- WELL TO THAT. FOR FOLKS THAT THAT DON'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS. THAT WOULD LEAD TO COMPLIANCE ON THE THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN PROTOTYPE THEY'VE BEEN TESTED -- WE ARE NOW HEADED TO A JULY ONE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRST STEP THAT WILL BE -- NOTHING NOTHING DONE IN A LARGE PROGRAM IS DONE BIG BANG SO WE'RE STARTING WITH -- ONE SMALL PART OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THEM TO OF ALL THE TO BE VOLUNTEERING TO GO FIRST -- TO DO THE IMPLEMENTATION THEY'LL BE A PILOT PERIOD -- FOR THE COUPLE OF MONSTER TO WORK OUT BUGS. LOOKAT LOOK AT ENROLLMENT STRATEGIES THAT WORK AND DON'T WORK FOR PEOPLE WERE STARTING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY USING ELECTRONICS SERVICES PORTAL -- BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S EASIEST BUT THEN THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T YET USING NOT FUNCTIONALITY THAT WILL NEED TO BE REACHED. POINT BEING IN LA COUNTY IS STARTING FIRST WE THINK BY JANUARY WE SHOULD BE THROUGH MOST OF LA COUNTY. AND THEN A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTIES BEYOND BECAUSE WE MADE THE DECISION WITH WITH COUNTIES -- THAT LA WOULD GO FIRST -- WHO WE ARE BRINGING SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN MONEY THAT WE HAD PLANNED FOR BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE INTO THE BUDGET YEAR BECAUSE WE WILL LA ALONE IS 40% OF THE CASELOAD? SO. I WILL BRING SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION MONEY FROM THE OUT HERE INTO THE BUDGET YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE MONEY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU MILLION. BUTTONS FINANCE. MANY MEMBERS. PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MAKE WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE ADMINISTER THE AYE TO SAYS PROGRAM ON YOUR BEHALF. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT MONEY IN THE MAY REVISION WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE FUNDING IN THE MAY REVISION FOR COUNTY ADMINISTRATION. IS ONLY FOR EXISTING CLIENTS AND PROVIDERS THERE'S NO ONGOING MONEY FOR NEW -- CLIENTS A NEW PROVIDERS IN A PROGRAM WITH GROWTH AND TURNOVER -- THIS IS A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED A DIFFICULT PROCESS FOR CLIENTS IN PROVIDERS TO NAVIGATE. AND YET THERE'S NO RESOURCES FOR COUNTIES TO HELP EXPLAIN THE MORE COMPLICATED REQUIREMENTS OR TO HELP PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM HAVE. BEEN SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SO WE WOULD ASK. OUR MEMBERS HAVE ESTIMATED -- A NEED FOR A POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE AND PROVIDERS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY ON THE PROGRAM. LIBBY SANTOS ON BEHALF OF COPPER FOR HSS AS WELL AS AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA WANT -- TO ALIGN MYSELF. MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER MAC -- THERE'S APPROXIMATELY A 30% PER YEAR TURNOVER RATE IN A TRUST US AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE THE FISCAL YEAR -- ALLOCATION FOR ON BOARDING -- PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS INTO THE EEVEE PROGRAM BUT REALLY WE REALLY THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THE EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR OUT YEARS -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME GOOD MORNING MY THE GRAY REPRESENTING LESS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP IN ESTABLISHING THE EBV PROGRAM AND WANTED TO ALSO ASK FOR THE ONGOING FUNDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME PER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL AND WE JUST WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE ALL THE EFFORTS HAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH. IN BEING RESPECTFUL THROUGH THEIR PRINCIPLES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A U. V. V. N. AS WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES -- WE CERTAINLY SEE THAT WERE ON A MUCH BETTER PATH THAN THOSE OTHER STATES ARE ON IMPLEMENTATION SO WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL IN THE END TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THERE ARE THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR COUNTIES THAT WE'RE BRINGING THIS HOME IN THE WAY THAT I THINK WE WERE ALL INTENDING FROM THE BEGINNING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MCCARTY MOTOS HE CAN'T FAMILY MEMBER FIRST OF ALL PRE SHAPE THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION. OVER THE PAST A YEAR AND A HALF ON EVEY VIS I THINK THE STAFF FROM THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN SENSITIVE. ON THIS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE -- SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ARE ACTUALLY THE PROPOSAL OR THE CONCERNS RAISED BY FRANK MECCA. AND LASTLY THE ISSUE OF VVV AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL SUPPORT THE IDEA OF THE LA PILOT. BUT THE RESTORATION ISSUE REGARDING THE 7%. IT LIKE A LOT OF THINGS UNDERMINES THE CREDIBILITY THE TRUST. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TRIED TO BUILD UP WITH STAKEHOLDERS. URGING THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE IS NOT GONNA MOVE FOR WITH A POLICY THAT'S GOING TO BE INVASIVE AND TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHTS IN IMPLEMENTING THE V. THE BUT THEN. THE STATE GOES BACK ON ITS WORD ON THE 7% SO IT MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO TRUST. AND THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF POLICY MAKING IS NOT JUST MAKING POLICIES GOOD OR BAD IS BUILDING THAT TRUST WITH THE WITH CALIFORNIA'S THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- SO MAY MAYBE CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED -- REGARDING AN ONBOARDING SO PRECIADO THE THE WORK HERE PEACHES THE PARTNERSHIP ON DVD I KNOW IT'S BEEN A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE AND I THINK -- THAT REALLY APPRECIATE THE MINISTRATION WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND SOUNDING LIKE WERE YOU KNOW. LANDING ON A GOOD PLACE THERE BUT IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR pABOUT ON BOARDING AN ANTI WHAT CAN YOU PLEASE. THE OF A DRESS THAT YES CERTAINLY I I'M NOT PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE CALCULATION AROUND THE EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THAT THAT YOU JUST HEARD -- WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS THAT WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS BEING A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT PEOPLE HAVING THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE? I I WOULD SAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR TO A COUPLE OTHER AREAS IN THE BUDGET INCLUDING THE AND A CAL FRESH EXPANSION TO THE SSI POPULATION. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE REAL ACTUAL DATA ON IMPLEMENTATION AND THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF EFFORT THAT IT TAKES? ON AND WE HAVE OUR COMMITMENT YOU KNOW HERE AT THE AT THE TABLE THE IT'S AN ANNUAL BUDGET% PROCESS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. WHETHER THAT MONEY IS NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR OR BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE I I'D LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT -- BUT YOU KNOW CASA CASA WE WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND WE'RE OPEN TO REEVALUATING THE NEED FOR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INDEED FACTS SUCCESSFUL AT THE END OF THE DAY. OKAY OKAY ANY ANY FOR THE COMING FROM FINANCE ON THAT. I JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUE MADE ESPECIALLY AROUND THE FACT THAT AS WE ROLL OUT EBV WILL HOPEFULLY BE QUE A LOT MORE DATA AND INFORMATION AND THAT WAY WE CAN HAVE A INFORMED PICTURE.

AND APPRECIATE INCREASE STATE GENERAL FUND PROPOSED THE MAYOR VISION TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW PUTTING IN THE RESOURCES TO HELP -- WITH THE GREEN OF THE COUNTY SO. WE CAN JUST. NOT TRADE OF THE EXPIRED CUTS WE'D ALL BE HAPPY ARE EIGHT OKAY. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. ALL RIGHT -- OKAY. SO. NEXT UP IS -- BACK WE WE DON'T COUNT WORKS SO -- DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES CAO WORKS. WE GOT SOME. AS YOU'VE HEARD ME TO OBSERVE THAT AREA OR MANY PEOPLE AT THE TABLE HERE NO THANK YOU. OKAY WELL MAYBE WE'LL DO THE COOK NEW INTRODUCTION FOR THE PEOPLE THE TABLE ALEJO. GOOD MORNING TO AS ALAMO DEALIO. OKAY FINANCE HER WORDS OF FINANCE ALL RIGHT LET'S GO AHEAD BEGIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- AS YOU FOR ME TESTIFYING PRIOR HEARINGS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON REVISED ADMIN BUDGETING METHODOLOGIES FOR A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS -- IN CAL WORKS WE IN IN AMERICA'S AND IMPLEMENTED A DAY THE METHODOLOGY ARE AROUND THAT AND ALSO -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH -- COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION C. SACK IN AND COUNTIES ON A METHODOLOGY FOR THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES COMPONENT OF THE SINGLE ALLOCATION. THERE'S TWO PIECES HERE THERE'S THE COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER TIME TO ENGAGE WITH CLIENTS THAT AS WELL AS THEN THE FUNDING FOR DIRECT SERVICES THINGS LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT ENABLE PEOPLE TO GO TO WORK. THE MAY REVISION REFLECTS -- IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT ON THE TOP OF PGE SIX IN YOUR AGENDA CALLS OUT AND WE'RE ASKING FOR A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO TO IMPLEMENT THAT METHODOLOGY -- AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE PROPOSAL HERE. THANK. YOU COMMENTS. THANK YOU FROM. IN REVIEWING THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION PROPOSALS TO CONTINUE UPDATING COMPONENTS OF THE SINGLE ALLOCATION AND IN THIS CASE PARTICULAR TO THE THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES COMPONENT. ON THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED. TO PROVIDE -- BUDGETING FOR CASE WORKER LEVELS BASED ON THE BILL THE LEVEL OF NEED ESTIMATED -- THAT THE THE CAL WORKS PARTICIPANT NEEDS -- AND SO IN THIS SENSE IT'S A IT'S A MORE CUSTOMIZABLE BUDGETING METHODOLOGY AND AND FOR THAT REASON -- WE THINK IT'S A PROMISING STEP TOWARD ACCOUNTING FOR DIFFERENT NEEDS THAT THE DIFFERENT POWERS CLIENTS MAY HAVE -- ONE KEY OUTSTANDING QUESTION THAT THAT WE REYES HAS TO DO WITH IMPLEMENTATION -- THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY IS CALCULATED BASED ON THESE DIFFERENT NEED LEVELS. AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL -- SO THAT THE STATEWIDE DATA IS ASSESSED AND THE BUDGETING METHODOLOGY IS IS. DERIVED FROM THOSE NUMBERS AND THEN AS AS HIS HISTORICALLY THE CASE THAT APARTMENT INCOME CAN COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTIES DETERMINES HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT STATEWIDE. BLOCK WILL CALL IT OUT TO THE COUNTIES I'M IT'S NOT CLEAR AT THIS POINT IF. THAT ALLOCATION WILL BE MADE TO THE COUNTIES SIMILARLY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CASES THAT CUSTOMIZABLE LEVEL AT THE COUNTY. FOR FEDERAL BE ALLOCATED -- SORT OF BASED ON PRIOR YEAR LEVELS WITH SOME MORE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS -- SO WE THINK. AGAIN PROMISING STEP BUT BUT A QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S HOW CUSTOMIZABLE TO COUNTY LEVEL TO TO MAKE THE ALLOCATION. OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE. TALENTS OKAY YES SAYS ANDERSON I THINK IT WAS SURE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- REMAINING CASE WORK IS THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL THE CASES IN THE COUNTIES -- MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS GONNA CAR ABOUT TEN HOURS OF TIME VERSUS FIVE HOURS A TIME CAN YOU ARTICULATE. WHAT DATA YOU'RE RELYING ON THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE A? A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES ONE TO MAKE SURE THEY ABLE. TO SPEND THE APPROPRIATE TIME WITH THESE -- WHAT THESE PEOPLE? I I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE WE WERE JUST TALKING THAT WE DON'T LACKING PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT WE DID SURVEY COUNTIES WE TOOK THEIR DATA WE PROPOSED WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A LOGICAL YOU KNOW. THE HARDER CASES TAKE MORE TIME CASES TAKE CLASS I THINK IT'S A STARTING POINT FOR THAT CONVERSATION -- I UNDERSTAND THAT COUNTIES FEEL PRETTY STRONGLY THAT THE MOST INTENSIVE CASES TAKE TEN HOURS A MONTH -- I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD TELL ME THAT'S NOT TRUE OR THAT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT EITHER -- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION EITHER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS OR THROUGH THE LEARNING OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE GOING FORWARD. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU AND THE BUT STILL ALSO A FOLLOW UP ON SOME QUESTIONS THE LA -- HAD BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE INTENSIVE CASES RIGHT SO BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING. CLOSELY. SO IS A DIRECTORY OF A BELL SHAPED CURVE RATES OF INTENSE CASES OF PEOPLE AT THE END THE QUESTIONS FOR YOU CUT OFF HE CURVE AND THEN -- IS THAT THE AVERAGE OF THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS BEAT OUT LIARS AND THEN OF COURSE SMALLER COUNTIES WILL HAVE FEWER PEOPLE AVERAGE OUT SO YOU HAVE MORE VARIATION. SO I THINK CERTAINLY GETTING MORE DATA AND GETTING ACCURATE DATA. WOULD BE HELPFUL I DO APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH THE COUNTIES AND AND IN DOING THIS -- TO STAY WILL REMIND PEOPLE BEFORE -- THE THE THE THE DEPARTMENT THE COUNTIES EMBARKED ON THIS WE WOULD JUST WORKING ON A LINEAR MECHANISM WHICH ACTUALLY UNDERMINE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. DURING GOOD YEARS AND THEN WHEN. DAD YEARS CAME YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS PLAY CATCH UP SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS INVESTMENT AND AND THEN ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE PUT IN SOME MORE MONEY DURING THE GOOD YEARS -- TO MAINTAIN AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL THEN BE READY -- IF THE CASE LET'S GO UP WHEN -- ECONOMIC HARD TIMES A STRIKING PEOPLE NEED THE HELP SO I REALLY THINK -- THE PARCHMENT IN THE HARD WORK ON DOING THIS I THINK THIS -- METHODOLOGY CERTAINLY HAS PROMISED BY IF MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE AREAS QUESTIONS ABOUT SO WE CREATED FOUR CATEGORIES AND WILL HERE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM -- THAN PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE COUNTIES ABOUT THIS BUT EXACTLY AND ARE WE GOING TO EAT. FOR EACH COUNTY DO WE SAY WELL HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN EACH CATEGORY AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ALLOCATION IS TO TAKE STATE WIDE. DISTRIBUTION AND SAY WELL WE JUST DIVVY UP BY THE NUMBER OF CASES YOU HAVE SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT WHAT'S AND COUNTY SO WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE CURRENT DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF HOW YOU PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. FIRST LET ME START BY CLARIFYING OR MARKET I MADE EARLIER I MENTIONED THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES HAS TWO COMPONENTS THE CASE MANAGEMENT AND DIRECT SERVICES WE HAVEN'T DONE A METHODOLOGY ON THE DIRECT SERVICES PARTS I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT FINISHED EVEN THOUGH I SAID WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE METHODOLOGY. SO YOU KNOW THAT THAT SAID -- I I WOULD DâN THEN GO TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION MY ALLOCATION I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO TO REALLY HAVE HAVE PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO THAT -- HISTORICALLY -- LEFT THE FUNDING HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY CASELOAD FOR ACTUATION SINCE SO ESSENTIALLY WE'VE BEEN MARGINALLY BUDGETING AND BASED ON CASELOAD MOVEMENT IN CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNTIES ABOUT WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHO WEAR THAT CASELOAD IS GEOGRAPHICALLY MOVING WE'VE WE'VE ADJUSTED THOSE ALLOCATIONS. I THINK CONCEPTUALLY THAT'S A VERY LOGICAL THING HERE THE POINT IS NOT TO OVER BUDGET SOME PEOPLE IN UNDER BUDGET OTHERS WE WANT TO BUDGET WHERE THE CASELOAD FALLS -- THINGS LIKE AS AS YOU WERE JUST ALLUDING TO THE DEFINITION OF WHO FALLS IN WHICH MARKET IS STILL NOT SETTLED EITHER. SO I THINK THERE'S SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN FIRST -- CLICK. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN BEING UNFAIR TO ANYBODY AND EVEN IF WE BUDGET ACCURATELY BASED ON WHERE WE THINK THAT WORKLOAD IS GOING TO BE. THAT COULD BE A BIG OR A SMALL CHANGE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTY AND SO WE THINK ABOUT. RAMPS FOR THEM AND I OTHER THINGS THAT PLAY INTO AN ALLOCATION SO I I WOULD SAY THERE'S A LOT THAT STILL IN PLAY BEFORE I COULD TELL YOU HOW EXACTLY THIS IS GONNA BE ALLOCATED AND MANY MORE CONVERSATIONS WOULD NEED TO HAPPEN BASED ON THE FINAL BUDGET. AND JUST TO TO CLARIFY A BIT I THINK WE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WOULD BE PREMATURE AT THIS POINT IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAD. FULLY WORKED THROUGH -- THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WE RAISE THE QUESTION MORE OF A LONG TERM LACK -- AS WE EXTEND THIS NEW EMPLOYMENT SERVICES METHODOLOGY AND BRING IN THE DIRECT SERVICES COMPONENTS SO IT'S THE FULL METHODOLOGY SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE REEVALUATE JUST HOW FAR THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN GOING IN PURSUING THIS MORE CUSTOMIZABLE APPROACH -- IT'S IN NO WAY CRITICISM OF DSS WITH THE COUNTIES AT THIS POINT TO SOMETHING WE ONE FIVE AND I REALIZE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. AND I ACTUALLY JUST WANTING KNOWLEDGE APPRECIATE THE FACT WE'RE TAKING ON THIS WORK BECAUSE AT LEAST AND WE'LL HEAR VERY SHORTLY -- PLACE I THINK THIS IS A I MEAN THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT. TYPE THAT DON WHAT WE HAD BEFORE SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WE CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE THINGS EVEN MORE AND BUT I I HOPE THAT. WILL BE SURE WE KEEP THE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD I REALLY APPRECIATED MINISTRATION IN THE COUNTIES IN THE STAKEHOLDERS WORKING TOGETHER TO DO THIS FOR SO AT LEAST. MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT WILL HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM THAN WE HAD BEFORE. I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL AND I REALIZED ARE STILL ONGOING DISCUSSIONS THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO REFINE AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT'LL PROBABLY BE A MULTI YEAR DISCUSSION I MEAN ABOUT TO READ IN A MULTI YEAR DISCUSSION IT'S ALREADY BEEN. BUT IT'S BIG IT'S COMPLICATED STUFF IT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT A LOT OF MOVING PIECES AND YOU KNOW AGAIN NOT TO KEEP MAKING ANALOGIES TO THE CONFERENCE EXPANSION BUT WE'VE COMMITTED TO COUNTIES THAT ONCE WE HAVE SOME DATA ON THAT. WILL LOOK AT OVERALL HOW WE BUDGET TO CALPERS PROGRAM I THINK WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT A NEW METHODOLOGY IT'S KIND OF A BLACK A TORRID AND MAKE SURE IT'S WORKING THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED AND AND TO CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO ADJUSTMENTS GOING FORWARD. OKAY SO -- I'M SURE WERE. EAGER TO TELL US HOUSING GOING FOR YOUR AND OKAY WELCOME. PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MAY CAUSE YOU TO BE DAY AND I NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHEERS LEADERSHIP ON THE SINGLE ALLOCATION ISSUE AND SENATOR STONE SUPPORT -- OUR PROGRESS AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARMENT OF FINANCE HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT. ON THE SINGLE ALLOCATION AND WE'RE WE'RE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL. FOR THE PROGRESS IN THE GOOD FAITH AND SO -- WE'RE ABSOLUTELY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN THE COUNTIES ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. TO TO SENATOR STONE'S POINT THERE'S ONE SORT OF PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AREA OF DIFFERENCE AND IT'S HOW INTENSIVE CARE OF THE CASE OR DO YOU NEED FOR THE INTENSIVE CASES AND I SHOULD SAY WE AGREE ON WHO THEY ARE. THE METHOD OF STRATIFY AND THERE IS AGREEMENT IF IT'S AT SOMEONE THAT SUFFERING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR HOUSING AND SECURITY FOR EXAMPLE SO THERE'S NO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE DISAGREEMENT THERE. IT'S HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE A WORKER AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE ACTUALLY PULLED WE ASK COUNTIES TO PULL CASES. TAKE SORT OF IF THERE IS SUCH A THING OF THE TYPICAL INTENSIVE CASE. AND SHOW US WHAT YOU DID BASED ON OUR PRACTICE ENHANCEMENT PROJECT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON AND IT WAS CONSISTENT FROM PLASTER LOS ANGELES THOSE CASES WERE TAKING AT LEAST TEN HOURS. SO WE'D LIKE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER IS INTENT LANGUAGE THAT SAYS NOT IN BUDGET YEAR BUT I'M BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE WE WILL MOVE. TO I'D ATTEND OUR STANDARD FOR THOSE INTENSIVE CASES AND CONTINUE TO REFINE THE OVERALL ESTIMATE IN THE PROCESS THE SENSE OF URGENCY FOR US IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO IMPLEMENT THE CARROTS OUTCOMES AN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW. SO WE ARE ABOUT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW WE'RE DOING WITH THIS CASES AND SO. WE FEEL AN URGENT NEED TO AT LEAST PUT A MARKER DOWN AND GET SOME AGREEMENT ON WHERE WE'RE HEADED -- AS WE EMBARK ON BEING ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESULTS. THANK YOU WELCOME. SB SANTOS ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA ONE ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF MISTER MAC OF BOTH THE EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION BUT ALSO THE REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE TEN HOUR VERSUS FIVE HOUR DIFFERENTIAL -- MY WORKERS KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES AND THEY PUT THAT MUCH TIME IN AND SO WITHOUT THE BUDGET LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THAT IT WILL GO UP TO TEN HOURS THE CONCERN IS. IS THAT YOU KNOW THE RESPONSE WILL BE -- WORKERS ARE GETTING IT DONE WE DON'T NEED TED FUND IT MORE LATER ON IT'S REALLY IMPERATIVE BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES TAKE THAT MUCH TIME FOR THE INTENSIVE CASES THANK YOU.

BUDGET LANGUAGE A CAP ON THE INTENSIVE CASES DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN HOUR SET OR NOT. TIGER WOODS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING WE JUST NOTE THAT. BASICALLY WHAT THE WORK WE'VE DONE SO FAR IS THAT WE'VE SET UP THIS STRUCTURE AND ANSWER MAC I WAS TALKING ABOUT STRIVE FINING FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CASE INTENSITY AND WHAT. NEEDS ARE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THAT CAL OR PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE DATA AND SOME BETTER INSIGHT INTO WHAT THAT TRUE NEED IT'S A FOR THOSE ALRIGHT BUT JUST TO CLARIFY BUT WE PUTTING ANYTHING IS THERE PROPOSAL TO PUT INTO. BUDGET LANGUAGE -- INTO THE ACTUAL BUDGET A STATE LIKE YOU CAN'T BE HIRED AN EX NUMBER OF HOURS SO IT SO THERE'S THERE'S ELECTABILITY FOR YOU IF YOU SAY IT'S TEN HOURS NEW GREETS AND OURS WILL BE TEN HOURS. WE WE ESTIMATED CASELOAD TIMES NUMBER OF HOURS TO GET TO A DOLLAR FIGURE TO PUT IN THE BUDGET BUT THERE'S NO LIMITATION THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T SPEND MORE THAN FIVE HOURS ON AN INTENSIVE CASE IN. ANY OKAY. SO I GUESS THEY IS A BUDGET ASSUMPTION NADA POLICY LIMITATION OKAY THAT'S WHEN I CLARIFIED BECAUSE I'D SAY JUST TO THE WILL OF THE GIVE BE SURE THERE'S THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE ARE NOT BUILDING IN SOMETHING AND DOESN'T GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT CONVERSATION. SUIT TO AFTER YOU KNOW GOING BACK AND FORTH AND RECOGNIZING YOU MAY HAVE TO IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT YOU KNOW COME BACK -- BUT THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING INTO THE LAW IT INTO THE BUDGET A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF HOURS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SAID DISEASE POINT OUT YOU STILL HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS YOU'RE STILL COLLECTING DATA AND SO FORTH IT'S TOO EARLY TO CODIFY OKAY.

BUT YOU YOU PROBABLY ARE FAMILIAR THAN IN MOST OF OUR STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS WE HAVE TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY NOW FOR FOR VARIOUS REASONS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO GET INTO STAGE ONE THOUSAND AND PART OF THAT AND WE THINK IT'S TIME TO IMPLEMENT THAT POLICY IN STAGE ONE AS WELL. FAMILIES WHO ENTER STAGE ONE AND NEED STAGE ONE CHILD CARE ARE WHERE THEY ARE MOST VULNERABLE AND THIS IS CERTAINLY THE PLACE PERHAPS WORSE THAT STABILITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FIRST. THANK YOU AVAIL. WORD STILL REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL -- BUT AT AT FOR SORT OF FIRST GLANCE IT'S ONE OF THE MORE MAJOR -- BUDGET PROPOSALS IN THE COW WORKS WORLD FOR THE MAY REVISION -- IT WILL MAKE STAGE ONE CHILD CARE MORE LIKE STAGE TWO AND THREE IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM -- THE THE TO PURSUE THAT THE LARGEST THROUGH POLICY COMPONENT FROM PROGRAMMATIC STANDPOINT IN OUR VIEW IS -- A CHANGE. TO THE LENGTH OF DURATION -- THAT A FAMILY RECEIVES CARE IN STAGE ONE CHILD CARE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THAT WOULD GO TO TWELVE MONTHS -- UNDER CURRENT PRACTICE COUNTIES ARE THEMSELVES TO FIND WHEN A FAMILY IS STABLE AND AT THAT POINT THE FAMILY WOULD TRANSITION INTO STAGE TWO OF THEM A REVISION PROPOSAL THAT PERIOD CANNOT BE. SHORTER THAN TWELVE MONTHS SO WILL BE STANDARDISING THAT THAT TIME THE FAMILIES IN THE STAGE ONE PROGRAM. THANK YOU FINANCE. OKAY COMMITTEE MEMBER QUESTIONS OKAY PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MCCOURT CWD A WE SUPPORT THE TWELVE MONTHS CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY IMPACT OUR WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SENATOR MITCHELL IN THE ADVOCATES ON REFINING THE PROPOSAL FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND SO -- WE ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORTED IT WILL SIMPLIFY. THE RECEIPT OF CHILD CARE -- WE ARE ACTUALLY ASKING FOR A CHANGE AN ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED. TO SEPARATE CHILD CARE OUT OF THE REST OF THE CAL WORK SINGLE ALLOCATION SINCE THE INCEPTION OF CAL WORKS THE COMPONENTS OF OF THE SINGLE ALLOCATION HAPPENED FUNGIBLE. AND THE PROPOSAL WOULD SAY CHILD CARE IS NO LONGER PART OF THE SINGLE ALLOCATION ENOUGH FUNGIBLE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT POLICY. BUT TO IMPOSE IT WITH A MONTH AND A HALF LEFT BEFORE THE FISCAL YEAR STARTS FOR COUNTIES. IS AN UNDUE BURDEN ON US WE'VE ADOPTED OUR BUDGETS BASED ON THE TWENTY YEAR PRESIDENT THE FISCAL YEAR STARTS JULY ONE THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO HIRE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WORKERS. SO WE'RE ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE US A YEAR TO PHASE THAT IN A TIME CERTAIN. IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE BUT TO GIVE US A YEAR TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY. YOU FOR THIS REALLY SIGNIFICANT -- RULE OF THE GAME IN TERMS OF HOW WE FOUND THE OVERALL CAL WORKS PROGRAM. THANK YOU WELCOME.

COLOR IS THE COMPONENT OF THE COLORS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PREGNANT AND PARENTING TEENS -- INVOLVES AN EDUCATION COMPONENT AS WELL BT PART OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT WE ABIDE BY A CASE MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT'S ESTABLISHED BY. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL. IT'S A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT SHIFT -- THEY RECENTLY CHANGED THE MODEL THAT THERE AND HEARING TO IT KIND OF ALMOST DOUBLES THAT THE CASE ULTIMATE CASE MANAGEMENT COMPONENTS SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO ADD FUNDING. TO FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SO WE'RE PROPOSING THAT WE COMPLY WITH THAT STATUTE ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T PROPOSED TRAILER BILL ON THIS ISSUE. THAT THEIR FOOD WE WE KIND OF PHASE AND AND RAM ALLOW COUNTIES TO RAMP UP TO GET TO THAT STANDARD OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD -- AND AND SO THE THIS FUNDING REFLECTS NOT THE FULL COST OF DOING SO BUT JUST THE FIRST YEAR OF MEETING THAT NEW STANDARD.

THIS MENTIONS A BIG CHANGE BUT I THINK A VERY NEEDEDONE CELL DO APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON THE ISSUE NUMBER SIX DECREASED TEN OF FUNNY FOR CAL GRANTS -- I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS ONE WE GIVE A LOT OF MONEY TO THIS TO NAY COMMISSION EVERY YEAR TO FIND CAL GRANTS IT'S SOMETHING OF THAT WHAT WE CALL THE TENNIS BALANCER IN OUR BUDGET WE MAKE ALL THE CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS IN POLICY ADJUSTMENTS AND WE LOOK.

YEAR. THANK YOU L. L.. REVIEW THIS IS A TECHNICAL CHANGE WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST NO COMMENTS I THANK YOU FINANCE ALL RIGHT. COMMITTEE ANY. MEMBERS OF A PUBLIC COMMENT SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. AND THEN WILL ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT A CHILL BILL LANGUAGE SB SEVEN TWENTY SIX TERMINOLOGY CHANGING DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION. A LOT LAST YEAR WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR AND THEN THE SPONSOR OF THIS OF THIS LEGISLATION THIS IS THIS LEGISLATION THAT A COUPLE THINGS THAT RAISE THE OVERPAYMENT COLLECTION THRESHOLD FROM THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS -- SMALL DOLLARS ARE NOT COST EFFECTIVE FOR FOR GOVERNMENT TO GO BACK AND COLLECT -- SO THAT WAS ONE THING IT ALSO -- AUTHORIZE THE EXPUNGEMENT OF OLD DAD IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM IF YOU'VE BEEN. OFFERED FOR A WHILE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE COLLECTIONS IN A COUNTY COME BACK IN AND PUT YOU BACK IN -- AND SO THAT THAT PROVISION -- ALSO WAS THERE. IN THE DRAFTING OF THE BILL IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION -- THIS IS THE THE TERM EXPUNGE IS ACTUALLY COMMONLY USED WHEN WE DELETE OLD EXPIRED -- ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER BENEFITS OF THINGS THAT ARE LEFT ON USE ON CARDS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR ARE EXPUNGED. SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE FOR THE OVERPAYMENTS ISSUE TO THE WORD DISCHARGED FROM EXPANSION IS A FEW INSTANCES WHERE THAT CHANGES. THE THE OTHER THING THAT -- THAT WE DISCOVERED -- AND PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE REALIZED AT THE TIME WAS THAT -- THE WAY THAT WE WROTE THIS THE CALYX PROGRAM IS OF COURSE STATE WIDE CLIENTS MOVE AROUND THEY MAY BE SIR BY MULTIPLE OF THE SAUCE CONSORTIA DURING THEIR TIME ON AID. AND WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD STATEWIDE LOOK YET AT ALL THE DEBT THAT SOMEBODY HOUSE WITHOUT AN EXHAUSTED MANUAL EFFORT SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING. IS TO DELAY -- THAT EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS THE I'M SORRY THE DISCHARGE PROCESS. STILL LEARNING. TO THE TIME THAT WE HAVE THE CAL SAW SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT CAN PROVIDE THAT SINGLE STATEWIDE VIEW FOR PEOPLE IN A MUCH MORE ECONOMICAL FASHION. ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THE OVERPAYMENT COLLECTION THRESHOLD REMAINS AT TWO FIFTY WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO DELAY THE ENTIRE BILL JUST THE PIECES OF IT THAT MAKE IT AND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE SOONER THAN NOT.

AND THEN THAT REFLECTS A NET INCREASE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION IN TOTAL FUNDS OVER -- CURRENT YEAR -- SPECIFICALLY TO COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM WITH THEIR REGIONAL CENTRES WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR UPDATED POPULATION THAT IS NOW PROJECTED TO BE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND AND NINETY FOUR THIS REFLECTS A SLIGHT DECREASE -- JUST OVER OUR PURPOSE -- PROJECTED NUMBER FROM A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- HOWEVER WE DO REFLECT A PROPOSED AND A DATE A NUMBER OF SIX HUNDRED AND BURSTS. SIXTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION TOTAL FUN AND PURCHASE A SERVICE IN THIS IS PRIMARILY TO UPDATED NUMBERS RELATED TO PARTICULAR KIND OF SERVICE CATEGORIES SUPPORT SERVICES MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES -- IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING KIND OF THAT -- UPDATED NUMBER -- AS A DRIVER. FOR BUDGET YEAR PROJECTION WE'RE PROJECTING A CAT CONSUMER POPULATION WHICH IS REFLECTED AN UPDATE FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY ONE ALSO IN THE MAY REVISE IS PROPOSING -- FOR REGIONAL CENTERS A. A PROJECTED INCREASE OVER GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT. NINE MILLION -- OF TOTAL FUNDS AND AGAIN -- THAT IS -- COUPLE THINGS IS DRIVING THAT ONE IS THE RELATED TO THE CASE LOAD -- VARIANTS THAT IS PROJECTED AS WELL AS SOME OF THE SERVICE CATEGORIES IN WHICH WE HAVE UPDATED NUMBERS FOR EXPENDITURES ALSO REFLECTS THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT -- SUSPENSION A UNIFORM HOLIDAY -- AS SOME OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS -- FOR THE PROJECTED UPDATES STATE OPERATED -- ON THE AGENDA IS CORRECTLY REFLECTS THE PROJECTED -- RESIDENTS THAT WILL BE -- FOR CURRENT YEAR BUDGET YEAR AND THEN ALSO CORRECTLY REFLECTS THE PROPOSAL -- FOR THE TOTAL -- SPEND THAT IS UPDATED FOR MAY REVISE OF THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION TOTAL FUND FOR THE STATE OPERATING COMMUNITY FACILITIES WHICH IS REFLECTING. A NET INCREASE OF FOURTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION TOTAL FUN. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS RELATED -- TO THE PROJECTED -- POPULATION AND AND EXPENDITURES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU EL AL COMMENTS FINANCE. MEMBERS ALL RIGHT A PUBLIC COMMENT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO THE ENDING DODGING THAT WE HAVE A WE ARE INVESTING ADDITIONAL NUMBERS RECOGNIZE WE ALSO CASELOADS AND SO FORTH SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION -- OVERALL. OVER THE PREVIOUS BUDGET. I CAN AFTER READING ALL CENTERS YES. YES REGAL CENTERS OKAY I SHOULD NUMBER TWO PROVIDER RATE ADJUSTMENT. SO FOR THE PROVIDER -- RATE ADJUSTMENT I AM THERE'S A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO THAT ARE PROJECTED IN HERE FOR ME -- TO RESPOND TO AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS WE HAD PREVIOUSLY TALKED ABOUT THERE'S A PROJECTION -- FOR BUDGET YEAR -- AND AND AS FAR AS AN ANNUALIZED NUMBER THE PROJECTION FOR THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT IS TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND WHICH IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION THAT'S ANNUALIZED. BUT FOR NINETEEN TWENTY THE AGENDA CORRECTLY -- REFLECTS WHAT IS PROPOSED. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY SO REGARDING IT SO IT'S A HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION TOTAL FUND AND THE NINETY EIGHT MILLION -- WOULD BE FOR RELATED TO DDS I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE A PORTION OF THE TOTAL TWO HUNDRED JUST TO UPDATE THAT IS ALSO REFLECTS THE D. O. R. PORTION -- THAT YOU WOULD BE HEARING AND IN THE SUB COMMITTEE AS WELL. SO WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT JUST TO REMIND YOU WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT IT'S FOCUSED ON TARGETED AREAS -- THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED -- BUT AGAIN JUST TO REMIND YOU LOOKING AT COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS IN THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTED LIVING. AND SO THE QUESTION THAT WAS -- THAT WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS WAS TALKING ABOUT KIND OF THE THE GAPS YOU KNOW AND HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE RIGHT STUDY AS WE HAD DISCUSSED THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE METHODOLOGIES AND LOOKING AT THE PROJECTION FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT. THAT IT WAS RELATED AND INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDY SO WHEN WE WERE ARE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL -- RATE ADJUSTMENTS IT IS APPROXIMATELY 18% FOR THOSE TARGETED SERVICES. SO WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE TARGETED SERVICES AS IT COMPARES TO IF THE RIGHT MODELS WILL WERE FULLY IMPLEMENTED -- FULLY IMPLEMENTED COMPARED TO WHAT OUR CURRENT RATES ARE FOR THOSE TARGETED AREAS WE WERE ACTUALLY LET ME BACK UP. OUR OUR TOTAL -- GREAT STUDY AS COMPARED TO OUR CURRENT RATES SHOWS A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT 40% ON AN AVERAGE SO THAT'S A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW WITHIN THE DIFFERENT SERVICE CATEGORIES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS BUT ON AVERAGE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL AND WE INCLUDE THAT IN OUR TOTAL YOU KNOW VIEW OF OUR TOTAL RATE AS WE COMPARED TO THE RATE STUDY? THAT 40% IS THEN CHANGED TO A DIFFERENCE OF 23%. SO AGAIN IT IT IS FOR ALL OF OUR SERVICES BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT FOR YOU IS THAT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE TARGETED SERVICES WITH COMMUNICATOR FACILITIES. WITH SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT SERVICES THOSE ARE THAT THE SERVICES THAT DO YOU HAVE IN COMPARISON WITH THE RATE MODELS THE GREATEST KIND OF DELTA. IF YOU WILL BETWEEN CURRENT RATES AND THEN THE PROPOSED -- SUPPLEMENTAL RTES SO IT'S IT'S EVERYWHERE FROM ABOUT. 80% AND THEN LIKE FOR TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANT YOU KNOW IF THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE RIGHT MODELS IT WOULD BE LIKE AN ADJUSTMENT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND 5%. SO YOU DO SEE AND IN SOME OF THESE CATEGORIES IS THE GREATEST ELEMENT. I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THOUGH THAT IT'S NOT THE ONLY FACTOR WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT OUR TARGETED PROJECTIONS WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT KIND OF THE GREATEST GAP AS COMPARED TO THE RATE STUDY. WERE ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT FOR COMMUNICATOR FACILITIES THAT THAT IS THE AREA THAT WE ARE SEEN. THE REDUCTION OF ACTUAL PROVIDERS -- NOT ONLY RELATIVE TO THE CONSUMER POPULATION BUT JUST IN GENERAL WERE SEEN THAT REDUCTION AND IN THE ARM LEVEL PROVIDERS. WE ALSO ARE ARE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT MODELS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE H. CBS. COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE WE CAPTURE AND REIMBURSEMENTS. AND SO CERTAINLY WITHIN THOSE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THAT THEY ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH EIGHT CBS -- IT'S ALSO WITH OUR EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY WITH A SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT. THE OTHER PART THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANTTHAT THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE POINT OUT. IS REALLY MOVING THAT NEEDLE BETWEEN THE IN EQUITY BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE EXISTING RATES CERTAINLY PRESENT RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS. IS GOING TO FULLY SHRINK THAT GAP BUT IT IS DEFINITELY TAKING A LOOK AT HOW TO MOVE HAT NEEDLE FORWARD. SO -- AS FAR AS TAKING A LOOK AT THE QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR AGENDA ASKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE ADVOCATES PROPOSAL OF THE 8% I CERTAINLY CAN'T SPEAK TO KIND OF THE THEIR INTENT BEHIND THAT 8% BUT WHAT I CAN SAY. IS THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS A PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF OF CONTINUING TO PERPETUATE THE CONCERN OF THAT IN EQUITY BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND THE DIFFERENT SERVICES. THAT DOING AN ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS THE DOUBT WOULD WOULD CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE. THE CONCERN THAT WE WOULD HAVE IN KIND OF KEEPING THAT KIND OF STAGNANT WE WOULD NOT BE KIND OF FOCUS IN ON SOME OF THESE EFFORTS. NOT SUGGESTING BECAUSE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE IS THAT HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE GAPS FOR THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDING THE TARGETED. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT STILL SOME PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT ARE WITHIN KIND OF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM BUT AGAIN GETTING TO THE POINT OF SAYING LOOK WE DO NEED TO HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION AND AND REALLY OVER. THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS WE ARE GOING TO BE HAVING THAT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW A WHAT IS THE THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AS FAR AS ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. ORDER THE DRIVERS AS FAR AS OUR EXPENDITURES YEAH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT YEAR OVER YEAR KIND OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. WITH WITH REGIONAL CENTER -- PURCHASE A SERVICE EXPENDITURES WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INCREASE THAT WE ARE SEEN IN OUR EXPENDITURES AND AND THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED OVER THE MANY YEARS AND WE DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT. MORE FULLY SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF I MISSED ANYTHING AS FAR AS THE TARGETED QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AN AGENDA HAPPY TO DISCUSS THOSE WITH YOU. OKAY. ALEJO. A SONY PADDOCK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST WE WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT DOES USE SOME OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE RATE STUDY IN A BENEFICIAL WAY AS THE DIRECTOR JUST DESCRIBED FOR EXAMPLE TARGETING USING THE THE GAPS IN FUNDING IT COMPARED TO THE WHAT. THE RATE RATES WOULD BE WONDERFUL IMPLEMENTATION TO TARGET THE RESOURCES AS WELL AS TRYING TO REDUCE SOME OF THE INEQUITIES ACROSS PROVIDERS WHO PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICE IN THE SENATE IN A SIMILAR REGION -- HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME KEY CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND WE KNOW THAT IT MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDAMENTALLY BEGIN A RATE REFORM AND IN THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR. SO I'VE GOT KEEP -- FOR A PRIMARY CONCERNS. THE FIRST IS THAT THE FUND THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROPOSED IS RELATIVELY MODEST -- WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO THE RATE STUDIES IDENTIFIED FUNDING GAPS IF YOU WERE TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE RATE MODELS IN NINETEEN TWENTY IT WOULD INCREASE GENERAL FUND SPENDING BY ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS? WHERE IS THIS IS A A? TWO HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALIZED COST -- AND ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY BECAUSE OF THE HALF YEAR A PROPOSAL. SECOND AND YOU JUST DISCUSS THIS ISSUE -- IN THIS IN THE HSS ISSUE BUT THE PROPOSED SENSITIVE RATES RAISES CONCERNS AND I WON'T. GO OVER ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU JUST DISCUSSED BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THESE ARE SERVICES THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED -- SORRY CONTINUE TO BE NEEDED BY DDS CONSUMERS AND YOU TWENTY TWO IT'S NOT LIKE A ONE TIME. PROJECT THESE ARE REALLY ONGOING -- SERVICES -- SECONDLY ONE OF THE RATIONALES -- GIVEN FOR THIS READING CREASES TO STABILIZE RESIDENTIAL CAPACITY IN TO STABILIZE WORK FIRST CAPACITY ACROSS THE OTHER SERVICE CATEGORIES SO. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE THOSE AWAY IT'LL HAVE A DESTABILIZING AFFECT -- THIRD. WE NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL LIMITS THE SCOPE OF WHO BENEFITS FROM FISCAL RELIEF PROVIDED IN NINETEEN TWENTY WE ACTUALLY THINK THE WAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO TARGET THE INCREASES -- IS PROBABLY A MORE COST EFFICIENT APPROACH BUT IT DOES SORT OF LEAVE OUT A LOT OF THE OTHER PROVIDERS FROM ANY AMOUNT OF FISCAL RELIEF IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR. AND FINALLY WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL POSTPONES DOES -- DISCUSSION OF RATE REFORM -- I I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DIRECTOR NOTED THAT DISCUSSIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE OVER THE SUMMER -- BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL THE UPCOMING BUDGET IN NINETEEN TWENTY IT DOES NOT FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF RATE REFORM AND AS WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK OUR OFFICE HAD PUT FORTH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT FOR IDEAS. FOR EITHER DOING A STAGE ROLL OUT OF RATE MODELS OR AT LEAST PILOTING SOME OF THE RATE MODELS IN CERTAIN SERVICE CATEGORIES. THANK YOU FINANCE. ALL RIGHT -- HIMSELF PROVIDE MAKE DOES THAT WE SPENT BY MORE THAN TWO HOURS. DISCUSSING A LOT OF THE ISSUES -- SO. THE SO ANYWAY I'M NOT SAY THAT WE CAN'T BRING SOME OF THESE ISSUES UP AGAIN BUT IT JUST MIGHT OF MINE PEOPLE WITH. THREE TED PEARLY SENSE OF THAT I DID WANT TO ASK ONE CLARIFYING QUESTION I ASSUME CENTER STONE HAS SOME -- SOME COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS HE WANTS TO ASK SO I CAN JUST CLARIFY THAT. ONE SO THE SO UNDERSTAND IT YOU DECIDE TO DO TARGETED INCREASES THE INCREASES THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING ARE THE BEING PROPOSED BY ADMINISTRATION FOR THE SPECIFIC ISSUES. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE WHAT WAS RECOMMENDED RATE STATE DOESN'T RAISE IT FOR THESE FOUR ITEMS IS IT BRING IT ALL THE WAY UP TO WHAT THE RATE STUDY RECOMMEND THERE'S ONLY PARTIALLY? OUT. TWO IT DOES SO SO FOR THE ONES THAT YOU ACTUALLYARE PROPOSING INCREASES FOR RESIDENTIAL SERVICE SUPPORT SERVICE FOR EMPLOYMENT AND TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANCE IS THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED TO BRING. THE CLOSE THE ENTIRE GAP ONLY PARTIALLY CLOSE THE GAP THIS PURPOSE MENTION AND REYES STUDIED WILL. ON AN AVERAGE SO. I'LL HAVE MY COLLEAGUES KIND OF CLARIFY IF IF I'M NOT KIND OF CAPTURING THAT. SO AND GENERATE STUDY IT SAID THIS AND A NEW CENTER PERCENT OF THE RATE STUDY AND SO THE NOW RECOGNIZING THAT ALL OF THOSE SERVICES ARE AT DIFFERENT. LEVELS WITH IN THAT 100% SO AS I WAS SAYING THAT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT CCF IS THAT ABOUT 80% YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. YOUR TRIP YOU KNOW OR THEIR AS TO GET THERE IS LIKE AN 80% INCREASE TO GET TO SO YOU'RE YOU'RE PROBABLY AT A MUCH LOWER PORTION. THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THOSE SERVICES TOGETHER WOULD GET YOU TO ABOUT 60% OF IF IT WAS FULLY FUNDED IN THE RATE MODELS SO FOR THE TARGETED SERVICES THAT YOU IDENTIFIED FOR YOU ARGUED RECOGNIZE AS A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE NOT. INCLUDED. IT'S A PARTIAL IT'S A IT WOULD BE A PARTIAL IF THE RATE MODELS WERE FULLY IMPLEMENTED FOR EVEN JUST A SERVICES FOR THOSE SERVICES AND AND OF NOTE. THAT WHEN WE MEET. WITH WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL SO THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE IS THAT -- AS I HAD MENTIONED THAT -- THE THE RATE STUDY IF FULLY IMPLEMENTED ON AN AVERAGE WOULD BE A GIVE OR TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF ABOUT 40% INCREASE TOTAL OF ALL IN SCOPE SERVICES. SO WITH THE INVESTMENT OF THE SO THE RATE ADJUSTMENT THAT WE'RE PROPOSING THAT THAT WOULD THEN CHANGE THAT TO YOU YOUR YOUR DELTA WOULD READ WOULD BE REDUCED. HOWEVER YOUR THE SOME OF THE THE TARGETED -- SERVICES THAT I TALKED ABOUT CCAF TRANSPORTATION YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE SUPPORT SERVICES STILL ON TOTALITY WOULD BE. THE ONES THAT WOULD HAVE THE THE GREATEST INCREASE STILL THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO GET TO THE RIGHT STUDY. OKAY ABOUT IF THAT MAKES SENSE OF YOU CLOSING THE GAP CLOSING THAT GAP STILL HAVE A GAP IN THE GAP. UTILIZING THE GAFFE THAN IN SOME WAYS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IT IS IT'S MOVING THE NEEDLE IN THE SENSE OF TRIED OF IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A A PROPORTION OR A RELATIVE PERCENTAGE. AS IT IS BASED ON COMPARED IT TO THE RIGHT STUDY SO WE STILL SO WILD THOSE TARGETED AND GRANTED AND FHA. YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IF IT WAS FULLY AT THE RATE STUDY WAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THEY HAVE A SMALLER PERCENTAGE INCREASE THAT WOULD OCCUR. MORE YOUR LARGER ONES WOULD BE THE CCS AND SOME OF THE SUPPORT SERVICES AND SO WHAT I'M JUST SAYING IS THAT. YOU KNOW WITH THAT WITH THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE STILL AS COMPARED TO THOSE. SERVICES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL THEY STILL WOULD HAVE A GREATER DELTA BETWEEN. THEIR NEW RATE AND OKAY IF THE RIGHT STUDY WAS IMPLEMENTED AT OKAY. IF I MIGHT ADD -- WHEN WE WHEN WE SPOKE WITH THE DEPARTMENT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND THEY ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD COST ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION SIX HUNDRED PLUS? MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS GENERAL FUND FOR THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AUGMENT SO JUST PUT IT IN THE CAR OKAY. RIGHT SO WHAT AND THAT'S JUST FOR THE ONE CATEGORY THAT WE'RE JUST TAKING THE ONES OF THE BIGGEST ALT AND MAKING THE DELTA A LITTLE SMALLER. IN THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE OF CCF'S THAT IS ACCURATE. OKAY ALL RIGHT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT CENTER STONE AND FRY HAVE MORE COMMENTS LATER THANK YOU LETTERS SO SO. IF WE'RE TO FULLY FUND THE LAND FROM AN ENTITLEMENT ACT IN SPIRIT. IT WOULD COST US ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. IS MY UNDERSTANDING. AND YOU'RE PROPOSING. THAT WE USE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION THIS YEAR. WHICH LEAVES -- SIGNIFICAN DOT OF ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS. YOU CAN ENHANCE THE THESE FOUR CATEGORIES SO WERE REALLY UPSIDE DOWN. BUT WE'VE NEGLECTED. TO DO RATE INCREASES FOR OTHER SERVICES THAT. HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR DD COMMUNITIES -- THE ADVOCATES HAVE -- BEEN ASKING. IN LIEU OF YOUR FINAL COMMENTS ON THE RATE STUDY IN A PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE. WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE. BECAUSE WE'RE FINDING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES OUT OF OUR OUR REGIONAL CENTERS SO. ASSUMING THAT YOU. INCREASE THE FOUR CATEGORIES AS YOU HAVE PROPOSED IF YOU WERE TO ADD AN 8% INCREASE TO THE OTHER SERVICES. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT. KIND OF A BUDGET ENHANCEMENT YOU WOULD -- NEED I'M I'M HEARING ABOUT A QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS AND ABOUT RIGHT TO FIFTEEN FIFTY MILLION. OUR POLICY IS WE DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH US RIGHT NOW BUT IF -- THAT'S A QUESTION WE CAN GO AHEAD AD TAKE A LOOK AT AND PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU SO WE WE TASK YOU WHAT'S -- DURING A RAID STUDY. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE RATE STUDY WEST. TO PROVE THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR RATES TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET. THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND CERTAINLY DESERVE -- SIX SO WHY -- EVEN IN THE FOUR CATEGORIES TO CHOOSE -- ENHANCED WHY WOULD WE STILL SEE A DELTA. WE CAN'T CLAIM THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY COMING INTO THE TREASURY BECAUSE WE SEE OURSELVES HAVING TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN WE HAD BUDGETED. FOR SO WHY ARE WE FULLY FUNDING THESE FOUR CATEGORIES AND AUGMENTING THE OTHERS. I SEE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN THE BUDGET FOR ME AND I'VE BEEN. TUNING THE HORN FOR PROVIDER RATES TO BE INCREASE FOR THE PAST. FOUR YEARS AND I'VE BEEN HERE. AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF OUR REQUESTED FALLING ON DEAF EARS -- I WAS HOPING -- THAT TO THEIR NEW GOVERNOR THAT MAYBE HE WOULD SHOW MORE OF A SENSITIVITY. TO THIS VERY FRAGILE POPULATION -- AND KIND OF PUT. MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS AND WANTING TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THAT. REALLY DESPERATELY NEED SERVICES AND I THINK YOU'LL AGREE THAT. WE HAVE MORE OF A NEED THAT OUR ABILITY TO FUND SERVICES I THINK YOU WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH ME THAT. WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT ARE WAITING FOR SERVICES THAT ARE GETTING THEM. AND SO I STILL THINK THERE WERE GROSSLY UNDERFUNDING. ARE PROVIDERS -- I DO UNDERSTAND WHY IN THESE GOOD TIMES. THAT WE DON'T FULLY -- FUNDS BASED ON THE EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING STUDY THAT WE DID BUT AT A MINIMUM. WHY WOULD WE -- ADOPT THE 8% FOR THE REMAINING ITEMS SO THAT WE CAN GIVE SOME. CONFIDENCE IN THE IN THE COMMUNITIES AT ALL OF US SERVE THAT THE TV COMMUNITY IS GOING -- TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT THEY COULD SEE SOME LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. FOR MANY MANY YEARS OF CUTBACKS AND AND AND NON RESTORATION TROODON RESTORATION EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR THAT. COUPLE OF COMMENTS THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US WE REALLY DID. TAKE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES AND WHICH WE ARE GOING TO PUT FORWARD -- AS A PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT I HAD MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE COMMUNICATOR FACILITIES REALLY STABILIZING WE HAD HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT THIS IS A PARTICULAR AREA OF CONCERN SEEN YEAR OVER YEAR THOSE CHANGES. AND THEN TAKING A LOOK AT SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES AND THEN ALSO THOSE THOSE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE SO CRITICAL WE'RE INDIVIDUALS WITH WITH PRETTY COMPLEX NEEDS. NEEDING THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT PERSONAL ASSISTANE THE SUPPORT SERVICES AND TO RESIDENTIAL INTO DAY PROGRAMS AND ALSO INTO THE FAMILY HOMES. THOSE AND THEN TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT WE HAD HEARD THAT. YOU THERE'S THERE'S A OF A REAL CLEAR NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE PRETTY INDIVIDUALIZED AND SO FOCUSING ON THAT. SO WE WE FOCUSED ON THOSE AREAS THAT ALSO TOUCH KIND OF BROADLY IN IN MANY OF THE OTHER CATEGORIES WHILE MEDIAN MAY NOT HAVE BEEN DIRECT INTO THE SERVICES. WITH DAY PROGRAMS SOME OF THE OTHER SERVICES THESE WERE THE AREAS THAT WE SAW AS THE PRIORITY AREAS TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND THAT IS THE PROPOSAL -- WE'VE BEEN I I I I LOOK AT EVEN THIS ANALYZE -- NUMBER THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE YEAR OVER YEAR WHICH IS PART OF THE BENEFIT OF THE A. B. X. TWO ONE SOME OF THE OTHER WORK AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT. ISSUES OR PRESSURES AND I THINK WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL SAYING THAT THERE'S THINGS WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND TAKING A LOOK AT HOW TO ADDRESS IT. BUT WE HAVE HAD SUPPORT THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE IN LOOKING ANNUALIZED. YOU KNOW WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM FROM SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YOUR FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER PURCHASE A SERVICE I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT. SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED IN FUNDING OUR SERVICES WE HAVE A COULD WE HAVE A CONTINUED GROWTH IN CASELOAD WHICH YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO ALL WORK TOGETHER TO SAY HOW DO WE DELIVER THOSE SERVICES. YOU KNOW FROM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY LOOKING IN THAT HE PROJECTED GROWTH AGAIN OUR CASE LOW GROWTH IS GOING UP OUR EXPENDITURE GROWTH I OUTPACING OUR CASE LOW GROWTH. YOU KNOW AND AGAIN I'M I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF OUR SERVICES. BUT THAT'S WHY WE REALLY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT EVERYTHING IN TOTALITY. UNDERSTANDING IT BECAUSE EVEN FROM 718-192-1920 WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE. IN OUR PURCHASES SERVICES SO. REALLY DRILLING INTO SOME OF THOSE GROWTH TRENDS AND UNDERSTANDING ARE REIMBURSEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THOSE PIECES. THAT SAID YOU KNOW AGAIN AND YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY EXEMPTION PROCESS. IS NOT THE FAVORITE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT IT IS A SAFETY NET. IT IS SOMETHING IN THOSE INSTANCES IN OTHER SERVICES IF THERE'S A NEED FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE GETTING SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. THAT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY THOSE SAFETY NETS WERE ALSO SAYING THAT FOR THOSE THAT WITHIN THE RATE STUDY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROJECTED AS A RATE REDUCTION. THAT THOSE ARE NOT THINGS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING AT THIS TIME EITHER SO I I JUST WANT TO ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT THERE'S SOME REALLYIMPORTANT THINGS THAT WERE. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT TO STABILIZE WHAT WE'RE TARGETING ON THE THE SERVICE AREAS THAT THAT WE'VE TARGET IN OUR PROPOSAL. NO AND I APPRECIATE THOSE TARGETED AREAS A CHIU OF EVEN HAND SIDE. AND I'M SURE THAT -- MANY OF THE FIGHTERS ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU'VE YOU'VE PROPOSED BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE STILL LEAVING A LOT ON THE TABLE FOR A LOT OF OTHER NEEDS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET. AND HOW DO I HOW DO I A RESPOND -- TO VENDOR REQUEST WHEN I SAY YOU KNOW SENATOR WHY -- WHY CAN'T I SEE MY RATE INCREASE BECAUSE I'M HAVING TROUBLE THE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY? WHEN THE STATE IS BOASTING THAT THEY'RE JUST FLOODED WITH CASH YOU KNOW WHY ARE WE THE PRIORITY? SO. IN AND WHY DO WE DO STUDIES THAT IDENTIFY IN QUANTITATIVE EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE. AND YET WE DON'T PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF CASH WHEN WE HAVE THE CASH SO. IF NOT NINETEEN TWENTY LET ME ASK YOU. WHEN DO YOU SEE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE LANTERN MEN ACT AS A FULLY FUNDED ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM HELPING THE MOST DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? THANK YOU CENTER IT WE RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM AND WE HAVE OUR PROVIDING SERVICES WE ARE STILL MEETING. THEN THE NEED OF OF SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS HER WALKING INTO THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND NEEDING SERVICES. NOW AS WE TAKE A LOOK AND UNDERSTAND KIND OF WHERE THOSE GAPS ARE YOU KNOW WE STILL NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE SOME OF THOSE GAPS IN SERVICES. AND AGAIN THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU IS ADDRESSING MANY OF THOSE GAPS YOU KNOW ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS EVERYTHING TO DAY BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE SOME THINGS WE DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND. APPRECIATE AND AND AND REALLY VALUE -- THE INTEREST IN OUR OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. BUT THE PRIORITIES THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND SUPPORTING OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM. IS IS BEEN. RECOGNIZE I THINK THROUGH THE BUDGETS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD AND APPROVED AND RECOGNIZING THAT OUR CASE SO GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURE GROWTH HAS CONTINUED TO BE FUNDED. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HAVING AN IMPACT TO OUR SYSTEM. THE RATE STUDY IT WAS A VERY INFORMATIVE PROCESS FOR US IT IT LET US TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE -- CAPTURED. ADDITIONAL LIKE SERVICES TAKING A LOOK AT WAGES AND AND COMPENSATION LOOKING AT TRAINING LOOKING AT YOU KNOW HOW MANY HOURS IN THE COMMUNITY IN A PARTICULAR INSTANCE FOR DAY PROGRAM SO THERE'S DIFFERENT. PROJECTIONS THAT WERE WITHIN TE RATE STUDY -- THAT WAS INFORMATIVE AS FAR AS EVEN REGIONAL DIFFERENCES THAT HELPED INFORM OUR PROPOSAL. SO AS OUR PROPOSALS MOVING YOU KNOW IS IS BEFORE YOU IS THAT WE DIDN'T. PUT THAT ON A SHELF TO SAY THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE PART OF IT BUT IT IS YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE A BIGGER DISCUSSION TO HAVE -- BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OF WHEN WE'RE GOING -- TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT'S FOR FOR ALL OF HIS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS -- BUT TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND MAKE SURE THAT ANYBODY WHO WALKS THROUGH THE DOOR OF A REGIONAL CENTER IS RECEIVING SERVICES AND TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE GAPS ARE SO WE CAN HAVE. KIND OF THAT THAT BROADER DISCUSSION BUT WAS IN THE PURPOSE OF THE READ STUDY. IS TO IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS AND QUESTION THOSE CAPS AND THEN YOU LOOK AND FIND OUT THAT THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE THOSE GAPS OF BECAUSE CONTRACTORS ARE TAKEN THE WORK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WORK FOR NOTHING. AND SO IT'S LIKE WE'RE NOT LEARNING FROM THE STUDIES. AND WE'RE JUST GIVING LIP SERVICE SAYS -- TO IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AT LEAST IN AND STATEMENT ONLY BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE THE THE THE THE THE TIRE OR TIRES MEETING THE ROADS. PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE ALONG FUNDED APPROPRIATELY AND SO I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IN THE IN THE IN THE GREATEST REVENUE STREAM THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S EVER HAD. WHY DOES THE DEVELOPMENT A DISABLED GET THE BACKSEAT IN THE STATE BUDGET WHY ARE WE WORKING TO FULLY FUND THIS PROGRAM? AND SO. I KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB. AND I'M I'M SURE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES HEARING BUT I'M VERY DISSATISFIED AS A CALIFORNIA. THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT WE OVERSEE WHILE WE WERE ELECTED I DON'T THINK THIS IS THIS IS A PARTISAN ISSUE THIS IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE. THAT THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THE HELP THE MOST AREN'T GETTING IT. AND YOU HAVE THE CONTROL AND THE HELP IN WORKING WITH THIS GOVERNOR AND STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ATTENTION THEY'RE NOT GETTING WE SHOULD BE HAVING A PEACEFUL APPROACH TO PROVIDING THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS BUDGET THANK YOU FOR RESPONSES. OKAY CENTER CHAU. YOU KNOW I JUST. WANT TO REITERATE AND EXPRESS MY CONCERNS AND JUST ECHOING WHAT -- MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR STONE JUST OP EMPHASIZED AS WELL IS THAT I THINK. THAT WERE REALLY REALLY NEED TO FOCUS IN ON THOSE. POPULATIONS OUT THAT. NEEDED THE MOST AND WERE. POTENTIALLY LEAVING OUTRIGHT -- PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT -- TODAY AND YESTERDAY AND PHONE CALLS AND IN PERSON. AND THERE'S SOME REAL CONCERNS THERE AND EIGHTY THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY IN TERMS OF HOW. YOU KNOW THE PROPOSED RATES ARE YOU KNOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE PLACE GEOGRAPHICALLY AND I SAID THIS BEFORE AND JUST REITERATING AGAIN -- THERE ISN'T CURRENTLY INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHETHER THERE WOULD BE REGIONALIZATION OF THE NEW BASELINE RAY AND WHETHER. SUCH OF REGIONALIZATION -- BUT PROVIDED LOW RATE TO AREAS LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- YOU SENATE DISTRICT FOURTEEN OR SENATE-DISTRICT. TWELVE BY THE HAVE DEEMED LOWER COST -- SO. WANTED JUST TO RE EMPHASIZE MANDATE THAT. SO IS THAT HE IS A MEDIA WE WE HAD AN EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION AND PRAYER HEARING ABOUT THE THE GENERAL ISSUES THERE ARE FEW MORE SPECIFIC THINGS I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON SO FIRST OF ALL -- HAVE YOU SEE HER DISSATISFACTION WITH THE LEVEL RATE INCREASE BUT EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE BEING OFFERED HAVE A SUNSET DATE AND STAND CORRECT. SO I AM NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION AGAIN WITH THE PRIOR ITEM -- WITH THE PRIME SOCIAL SERVICES -- IF WE'RE SAYING THAT WE'RE TARGETING AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO BRING CLOSE SOME OF THE APS IN A TELL PEOPLE WELL IN TWO YEARS THAT'S GOING TO GO AWAY AGAIN -- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CONVINCE PEOPLE TO SAY WELL ACTUALLY NOW I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND YOU CONTRACT OF MORE HIRES WHATEVER IS. IT'S DESIGNED TO GO AWAY AND TWO YEARS NOW THE REALITY IS IS THAT YOU KNOW WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION WILL SEE WATER REVENUES LOOK LIKE HIM IN THE BUDGET TO WHEN YOUR DOCUMENT WILL WE BUT WE DO LOOK OUT MULTIPLE YEARS I THINK. THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING WE SHOULD BE DOING -- BUT THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD BUILD INTO OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT THE THIS THAT WHAT INCREASE THERE IS. WILL GO AWAY. I MEAN THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE TELLING EVERYONE WHO GETS THE INCREASE THAT YOU CAN'T COUNT ON IT AND SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO YOU KNOW I CAN SEE THE CHANGES IN. AND BEHAVIOR TO CHANGE OUT THAT THAT THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT YOU WANT TO SEE FOR ME ENTRIES BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY BOB RIGHT -- SO I I CERTAINLY HOPE -- THAT -- THE ADMINISTRATION WILL AGREE I BELIEVE. WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT I MEAN OTHERWISE THAT'S JUST UNDERMINES THE WHOLE PIECE SELL. SELL SIDE FROM HOW BIG YOU KNOW WE AND WE WENT OVER THIS BEFORE LET'S LET'S NOT SEND THE SIGNAL THAT WHAT INCREASE WE DO DECIDE TO ADOPT -- FIRST REALLY AN ONGOING SERVICE I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT THE NEED GOES AWAY I MEAN IT'S ONE THING IF YOU HAVE A NEED AND YOU KNOW FOR ONE TIME INFUSION THAT TAKES CARE OF IT. YOU KNOW THEN THAT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE ITEMS SO LET'S LET'S NOT. SO I HOPE I HOPE WE CAN AGREE ON THAT -- THE OTHER ISSUE IS IS IT I APPRECIATE IN THE LAST HEARING AND AGAIN NOT WOODLAND REITERATE. THAT THERE IS A PRETTY -- WITH THAT THERE'S A PROCESS THIS WAS I MULTIPLE YEARS IN THIS VERY SUBCOMMITTEE WE WERE TOLD THERE'S A RATE STUDIES THERE'S A RATE STUDY. THERE'S A RATE STUDY AND WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE RATE STUDY THE RATE STUDY IS HERE. SO I KNOW THAT NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE RESULTS THERE'S GONNA BE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH VERY STAKEHOLDERS AND SO FORTH. BUT I THINK YOU YOU HEAR YEAR IS THAT OBVIOUSLY WE ARE -- NOT JUST VERY INTERESTED -- WE ARE YOU KNOW WE WILL WE DOES NOT WANT THIS RATE SAY THIS SIT ON THE SHELF IT'S BEEN. MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES OF COURSE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO COME NOW THAT IT'S HERE. AND WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON IT AND IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE GOVERNOR PRIOR GOVERNOR AGREED. TO RIGHT THIS IS THE THIS IS BEST A WAY AND THERE ARE SOME IMPERFECTIONS WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION BUT THAT. THIS WAS I THINK. YEAH THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT WE WANTED TO TAKE RIGHT I MEAN THIS DOES THE DEPARTMENT THAT. WORK WITH THE VENDOR TO FIGURE THIS OUT IT CETERA. AND IT'S HERE AND IT'S SAYING THAT WE HAVEA BIG PROBLEM WE HAVE A BIG GAP. AND OBVIOUSLYIT'S UP TO US AS THE POLICY MAKERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CLOSE THAT GAP AND HOW WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE BUT I THINK THIS OF COMMITTEES VERY INTERESTED AND I BELIEVE -- MAC ADDRESS SPEAK FOR THE ALL MY COLLEAGUES BUT I THINK THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE OVERALL. DOESN'T WANT. DISTANCE JUST SIT ON THE SHELF SO -- I'D STATE WAS JUST FOR THIS WAY THE EXPECTATION WILL BE IS THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU MENTIONED PRIOR HEARINGS GOT DISCUSSIONS OVER THE SUMMER. AND SO FORTH AND I REALIZE HE'S DISCUSSIONS ARE JUST GONNA BE FOR ONE TIMES AND BUT WE WILL TRY ONE AN IN DEPTH EXAMINATION OF WHAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT ALSO CONVERSATIONS STAKEHOLDERS -- A PRESENTATION ABOUT THIS THAT PERHAPS EVEN SEPARATE FROM JUST REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT. SO I HOPE THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT -- YOU USE THAT -- YOUR DEPARTMENTS AND DIRECTOR I KNOW THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY OPEN TO WORKING WITH US AND AND AND AND AND ARRANGING -- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A DETAILED UPDATE ON WHAT THE PLAN IS. A WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THE RATE STUDY IN THE FINDINGS THAT CAME OUT FROM THAT AND WHAT THE THE TENDED. NOT PROGRESS WERE PLAIN TO MAKE YOUR TO TEXTURES BUDGET OBVIOUSLY CELL. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. AS ALWAYS WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SO LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOU YEAH -- BLOW HEALTH WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING WORD TO ADD THAT THERE'S A FOR BUT THE OBVIOUSLY I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO REACH OUT BUT THERE IS A L. THE SUBS AND IT'S NOT JUST CONVERSATION BUT THERE ARE SOME AT LEAST SOME INITIAL PLANNING BUT YES. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. OKAY LET'S SEE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. DOCTOR PAN A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- RICK ROLLINS -- REPRESENT HARKIS SO SHE SHOULD REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES FOR SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN YOUR PRIOR SUPPORT AND CURRENT SUPPORT FOR OUR POPULATION LIKE TO ALSO ASSOCIATE. OUR POSITION WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S AND EACH OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. SPECIFICALLY -- WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE THE INPUT OF FUNDING THIS YEAR BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH QUITE FRANKLY WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE SYSTEM IS IN CRISIS. ACROSS THE BOARD AND WE'VE BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF THE 8% TO STABILIZE IN -- FUNDING FOR OUR SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD THIS YEAR ON THE QUESTION OF THE OF THE SUNSET -- CLEARLY IT'S A DESTABILIZING IMPACT AND I THINK THE POINTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE ON THAT IN MY LAST COMMENT IS IF NOT NOW WHEN -- TWENTY YEARS AGO WE HAD A SIMILAR STUDY OF THE CITY GATES STUDY THAT CAME OUT AT A SIMILAR TYPE TIME IN OUR ECONOMY WHERE THINGS WERE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. ONLY TO SEE A QUICK DOWNTURN IN OUR ECONOMY AND THAT PARTICULAR RATE STUDY SHELVED WE'RE VERY CONCERNED OF COURSE HOW SENSITIVE THE SYSTEM IS NOT HAVING A GUARANTEE OF FUNDING BUT HAVING AN ENTITLEMENT. THAT WE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE MONEY AND HAVE THE TIME AND HAVE THE DATA TO SUPPORT WHAT THE SYSTEM IS GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW THAT WE TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. NANCY CHANCE FAMILY MEMBER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHOICES PERSON CENTERED SERVICES -- AND THE CALIFORNIA. THE PERSON CENTERED PARTNERSHIP. AND THE PATH FOR COLLABORATIVE OKAY. I JUST WISH I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASE OF FOR THE SERVICES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED -- WE FEEL THAT AN INDEPENDENT LIVING AND RESPITE SERVICES NEED TO BE INCLUDED WITH THOSE SERVICES AS THEY BOTH ARE H. U. B. S. COMPLIANT AND ALSO HELP PEOPLE TO REMAIN LIVING IN THEIR OWN HOMES INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW HAVING TO GO TO A MORE RESTRICTIVE -- ENVIRONMENT. I AM ALSO OPPOSED TO THE SUNSET OF THE RATE INCREASE AND LESS THAT SUNSET IS ACTUALLY TIED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OF THE RATE STUDY. SO I MEAN IT WAS TIED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION THEN THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY NOW TO GET THERE BUT THERE IS NO NO MENTION OF THAT SO THAT'S CONCERNING -- AS YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THESE HEARINGS ARE -- OVER AND OVER AGAIN MOST PROVIDERS BIGGEST CHALLENGES HIRING -- PEOPLE AND PROVIDING A WITH A LIVING WAGE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND QUITE FRANKLY I I I'M ACTUALLY IS. A SUPPORT LIVING PROVIDER I AM ALSO AN INDEPENDENT PROVIDER IN A DAY SERVICE PROVIDER BUT AS OF SUPPORT LIVING A PROVIDER AYE I'M NOT GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING SALARY OR RAISES. IF I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE HIM AWAY IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT SO THAT'S A PROBLEM IN WITH THE SUNSET -- I'M AGREE IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT. MANY OF WHAT THE LA -- THE THINGS THAT THE LA -- SAID AND I THINK WE SHOULD HELP ALL PROVIDERS IN SOME WAY LIKE PERHAPS FUNDING FULLY FUNDING THE MINIMUM WAGE. TEXTING THAT MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK THAT FULLY FUNDS THAT AND THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES THAT WOULD HELP EVERYBODY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME A THING THANK YOU MARTY MOTO FAMILY MEMBER AND PART OF ALL THE GROUPS THAT NANCY CHANCES MUST MENTION. FIRST OF ALL JUST WANTED. SHOW MY APPRECIATION TO THE DEPARTMENT I MEAN THEY HAVE BEEN GOOD AND WORKING WITH ALL OF US. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A BUT THAT SAID. IT'S JUST IMPORTANT FRAME THIS DISCUSSION RESTORATIONS WHEN THERE ARE MADE WHETHER HERE OR AND I HSS OR ELSEWHERE. THERE SUNSET IT AND WONDERING INCREASES MADE EITHER HERE OR ELSEWHERE. THEY'RE ALSO SUNSET IT AND THAT'S A REALLY A UP A REALLY TERRIBLE IN BALANCE IN POLICY MAKING THAT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. TO ADDRESS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATION. FIRST WE PREACHER WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES WITH IN GIVEN THE FRAMEWORK WOULD LIKE. TO INCLUDE OR ASKED TO HAVE -- I'LL LESS INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AND IN HOME RESPITE INCLUDED IN SOME OTHER SERVICES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED SECOND. WE BELIEVE TAT THERE NEED TO BE -- BUT THE LEGISLATURE DOT TRAILER BILL PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE. ADOPTING OR LOOKING AT MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND PUT THEM IN TRAILER BILL. IS IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE THIS DOES -- CONVERSATIONS WHICH WE WOULD APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE ACTION STEPS TIED TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. SOMETIME IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET YEAR ON SOME OF THE RATE MODELS THAT CAN WORK THAT CAN ADDRESS. PEOPLE IN CRISIS REDUCING DISPARITIES -- A COMPLIANCE OF A HOME COMMUNITY SERVICES FINAL RULE. AND YOU'D LIKE THE LA ALL SUGGESTED WE CAN TRY THIS AND IN VARIOUS PARTS OF STATES AND PILOTS. LASTLY I THINK ALSO INTO THE PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE A NEED TO BE A REQUIREMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND DEVELOPING AN OUTCOME TOOL -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT WE MEASURE UNITS OF TIME OR LENGTH OF OF PEOPLE IN A SERVICE BUT ALSO WE MEASURE QUALITY OF SERVICES. THAT CAN THEN TARGET RESOURCES THANK YOU THANK YOU. IN GROCERY BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION. WHAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DONE WE CAN'T? HELP BUT FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE BY DECIDING. WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE RATE STUDY WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO A CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND THE LIKE AND AND WE WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE ASK FOR A PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD? THAT OBVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTATION THE RAGE THAT HE WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON WHAT THE RESULT IS FOR THOSE RATES BUT NOW WHAT. WE'RE SEEING IS A CHOICE OF WHICH SERVICE CODE TO THE QUESTION WAS RAISED. IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT DESTABILIZATION THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT THIS APPROACH WILL DESTABILIZE IF YOU ARE A PROVIDER WHO IS PROVIDING SERVICES IN MULTIPLE SERVICE CODE YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES DOING THAT WORK. YOU TO GIVE A RAISE TO ONE EMPLOYEE IN CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ANOTHER. AND WHILE THAT MAY SEEN ALL MICRO PROBLEM IT'S A MACRO PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO HAVE A DESTABILIZING AFFECT ACROSS THE BOARD. SO THAT IS ONE OF OUR MAJOR OBJECTIONS YOU CANNOT LEAVE OUT THESE OTHER SERVICE CODES WHILE THOSE ARE STILL SERVICE CODE WE WILL FIND OUT THROUGH THE RATE STUDY WHAT HAPPENS THERE BUT THIS IS A BAD APPROACH. AS IT STANDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CENTER STONE STAFF JORDAN THE WITH THE RK CALIFORNIA NEW YORK UNITED THROUGH PULLED THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE. FIRST JUST WANNA ALIGN OURSELVES HOLY WITH THE STATEMENTS FROM THE LA -- AS WELL AS FROM THE STATEMENTS THAT WE HEARD TODAY FROM THE SENATORS. THANK YOU FOR THOSE -- IT SPECIFICALLY THE STATEMENTS REGARDING TO THE RATE STUDY WE REALLY REQUEST THAT SOME TYPE OF TBL BE INCLUDED THAT. MANDATES THAT GREAT CITY IS IMPLEMENTED IN THAT WE GET THEIR STARTING NEXT YEAR OF DISCUSSIONS HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO HAPPEN OVER THE SUMMER -- THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE SERVICES IDENTIFIED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DO NEED INCREASES IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES A HUGE CONCERN HOWEVER SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THEN SAYS. BY NOT INCLUDING OTHERS THAT THOSE AREN'T IN NEED THAT THE NINETY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO FOR EXAMPLE OR IN A DAY PROGRAM -- ISN'T IN NEED OF HUGE INCREASES AS WELL HOWEVER JUST IN CONVERSATIONS ON FRIDAY WITH -- A LARGE -- SERVICE WRITER RIVERSIDE ANOTHER ONE YESTERDAY IN SACRAMENTO WHO -- IT'S PROVIDE SERVICES FOR SOME THE MOST MEDICALLY COMPLEX INDIVIDUALS IN THE AREA -- HAVE ALREADY CLOSED SOME PROGRAMS AND IS SAID TO BE THE ONE SACRAMENTO TO MORE WOULD HAVE TO AS A RESULT BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A HUGE LOSS. AT THE CURRENT RATES BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS FOR INCREASED RATES FOR THOSE SERVICES AS WELL A PERSON'S LIFE IS BRAIDED WITH SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY RECOGNIZING HOW THEIR BRAIDED -- FINALLY WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO WAIT FOR THE RATE STUDY WAIT FOR THE RIGHT TO BE FOR THAT RIGHT STUDY RIGHT CITIES HERE AND ACTUALLY BEEN TOLD. AGAIN LET'S WAIT SOME MORE AND TALK SOME MORE WE CAN'T DO THAT IN A PERCENT MINIMUM FOR EVERYBODY IF WE WANT INCREASE FOR MORE FOR CERTAIN SERVICES FANTASTIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CARL LUNDEN HERE ON BEHALF THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH IBD -- I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDER WITH CENTER STONE RACE TODAY WHICH IS. AN 8% FOR EVERY PROGRAM OUTSIDE OF THE ONES INCLUDED IN THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THAT SAYS SUPPORTER OF COURSE BY THE STERN LETTER -- REQUEST IT'S NOW BEEN SIGNED BY HALF OF THE STATE SENATE -- AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU VIEW JUST SOME SACRAMENTO ICE OUT LAST NIGHT AS A BOARD MEMBER -- FOR AN AGENCY IN A THREE HOUR BOARD MEETING WHERE WE DISCUSSED VERY SPECIFIC LOWER BUDGET IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR FOR US TO IMPROVE OUR BUDGET. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE STAFF PRESENTED TO US THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE STAFF PRESENTED TO US WAS A CHART. SHOWING OUR STAFF IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS HOW MANY PEOPLE WE HAD WORKING IN THE AGENCY FROM SIX MONTHS AGO TELL TODAY. GUESS WHAT A DROP FROM FOUR HUNDRED NINETY DOWN. TO FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THE MAIN REASON IS MONEY WHAT THEY'RE BEING PAID THE STAFF SATISFACTION SURVEY WE ASKED THEM TO TAKE EVERY YEAR WHICH WE ALSO WERE PROVIDED LAST NIGHT. SHOW THAT 90% OF THE PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THEIR JOB THEY LOVE THE JOB THEY LOVE THE MISSION. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAVING THE NUMBER ONE REASON THEY'RE LEAVING IS BECAUSE OF MONEY HOW DOES THAT TRANSLATE IN OUR AGENCY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IT MEANS WE LOST SEVENTY STAFF PEOPLE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT ALREADY HAVE AN I PP IN THE LOCAL REGIONAL CENTER WHO WERE RECEIVING SERVICES. THAT MEANS OUR STAFF FOR NOW HAVE AND YOU OVER TIME TO COVER FOR THE LOS STAFF THAT WE CAN'T COVER ANYMORE THAT IS THE PICTURE. OF EVERY AGENCY STATEWIDE AND THE LAST THING I'D SAY ABOUT THAT AND STATEWIDE VIEW. IS THAT WE HAVE WAITING LISTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT IS NOT MEETING THE DEMANDS OF EVERY PERSON ON THE COMMUNITY AS A DIRECTOR SUGGESTED. IF WE HAVE A WAITING LIST ANYWHERE WE ARE FAILING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THAT PERSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WELCOME. IF ANYONE WITH A SAY YOU CALIFORNIA -- APPRECIATE THIS AS A FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT PICKS AND CHOOSES -- WHICH SERVICES IN WHICH NEEDS ARE ARE. MORE APPROPRIATE FOR RESOURCES WHEN THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THEY'RE ALL IN NEED -- OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO THAT'S WHY THE 8% ACROSS THE BOARD WOULD E MORE BENEFICIAL. AS THE CONVERSATION CONTINUED WE HOPE THAT THEY DO CONTINUE IN AT THE RATE STUDY -- IS EVENTUALLY ACTUALIZE -- IS A WE WOULD ASK FOR YOU TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. OKAY -- SO WHEN. CALL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- BUT WHATEVER WE END UP FINALLY AGREEING TO IN THE BUDGET -- I THINK THERE'S TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN AND FOLLOWING WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO -- AS KNOWLEDGE OF COURSE FOR THIS YEAR WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT -- BUT ALSO IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS AS WELL AND AND SO HOPEFULLY WE GET RID OF THE A FOLLOW UP ON THE THE RATE STUDY ITSELF AND WHAT WE PLAN TO D WITH IT WHAT THE PLANS ARE FOR THE DEPARTMENT IN THE CONVERSATION COMMUNITY ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF EITHER THAT OR WHAT RATE METHODOLOGY WE WILL BE -- THAT WE SPENT ALL THIS TIME AND EFFORT DOING THE STUDY WHAT KIND OF REFORM TO EVEN TEND TO DO SELF. CONSIDER THIS THING AND IS THERE SOME A FINAL COMMENT AND APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS -- I AGREE WITH YOU I AGREE WITH THE THE SPEAKERS AT AGAIN THE THE TWO YEAR SUNSET IS -- ANTI PRODUCTIVE -- MY AT MY CONSULTANT STAFFERS -- COME UP IN THE FIGURE THAT IF WE WERE. TO GIVEN A PERCENT INCREASE TO THE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT BEING ENHANCE THE FOR SERVICES THAT ARE REPORT -- THE COSTS THE STATE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. AND I I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN AND REASONABLE AMOUNT -- TO TO STICK BACK IN THE BUDGET -- AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME SO. OKAY THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WELL WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- NEXT ISSUES ISSUE NUMBER THREE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REGARDING REGIONAL CENTER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. YES THANK YOU -- TO WALK YOU THROUGH AND AND AGAIN AND IN THE AGENDA IT CORRECTLY OUTLINES THE CONCEPTS AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST BRIEFLY WALK YOU THROUGH EACH OF THOSE CONCEPTS THAT'S RELATED -- TO THE PROPOSAL TO HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT RELATED TO TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. SO THE FIRST -- THREE ITEMS REALLY IS AROUND -- A FOCUS ON THE AREA AFTER -- TRANSPARENCY THE FIRST ONE IS PERFORMANCE CONTRACT REPORTING THIS YEAR WE CURRENTLY HAVE -- PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS THAT -- REGIONAL CENTERS PRODUCE AND WORK WITH THEIR COMMITTEES AND DEVELOPING ON ANNUAL BASIS AND THEN THEY RECEIVE DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT -- TO PROVIDE A MEASUREMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE MEASURES ON A ANNUAL BASIS. THIS IS JUST ADDING TO THE REQUIREMENT OF PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS AS A WELL WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE CHANGING THE MEASURES TO BETTER INFORM KIND OF THIS THE THE SERVICE DELIVERY. BUT THIS WOULD REQUIRE THE GOVERNING BOARDS OF EACH REGIONAL CENTER DIRECTOR TO ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACT. TO THE DEPARTMENT -- AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE US A SUMMARY IS TO KIND OF THOSE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE THE ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE -- FOCUS THAT THEY COULD DO TO IMPROVE IN EACHOF THE AREAS THATTHEY BUT IDENTIFIED AS A NEED. THIS WOULD ALSO -- EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL. THE REGIONAL CENTER PROCESS FOR STANDARDIZATION. THIS IS A IS LOOKING AT IN THOSE AREAS THAT -- REALLY ARE KEY AND NOT GETTING AWAY FROM THE UNIQUENESS OF EACH OF THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. BUT TAKING A LOOK AT HOW TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY FROM FAMILIES AND CONSUMERS. IS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WALK AND TO EACH REGIONAL CENTER IF THEY'RE ACCESSING KIND OF HIM YOU KNOW INFORMATION ABOUT. BEING A REGIONAL CENTER I'M RECIPIENT OF SERVICES YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THOSE SERVICES THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO THEM. SO THIS WOULD BE -- AN AREA IN WHICH WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY STATEWIDE HERE'S AN INTAKE PACKET IF YOU WILL -- THAT WOULD BE TRANSLATED IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EARLY START AND FOR LETTERMAN SERVICES. ON TO OUTLINE WHAT IS A REGIONAL CENTER WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WHAT ARE THE SERVICES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND AGAIN EVERY PERSON WHO BE JOAQUIN OR ASKING FOR SERVICE THAT THAT INFORMATION WOULD HAVE THE SAME ACROSS THE STATE -- OUR INTENT THEN WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CAN BE PERSONALIZED WITH THE NEED TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS AS LONG AS THE CORE. CONTENT WAS CONSISTENT WE WOULD BE -- WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO GIVE INFORMATION TO HELP DESIGN WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE TO MAKE SURE IT WOULD BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE. ON THE NEXT ITEM IS REFORM IS DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS -- THIS WOULD JUST EXTEND THE DEPARTMENT'S DASHBOARD -- THAT EACH REGIONAL CENTER WOULD BE POSTING AND HAVE ON THEIR WEBSITE THEIR RELATIVES THEIR PARTICULAR REGIONAL CENTERS DASHBOARD I'M AND A LINK TO THE DEPARTMENT SO -- THEIR COMMUNITY WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THE ELEMENTS ARE IN MEASURING -- THE KEY TRANSPARENCY PIECES AT THAT REGIONAL CENTER AND THEN BE ABLE TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENTS TO DO A STATEWIDE COMPARISON. THEN IN THE IN THE NEXT SECTION IS ABOUT BOARD GOVERNANCE -- THERE ARE THREE ELEMENTS THAT WE HAVE THAT WOULD BE RELATED TO BOARD GOVERNANCE IS REALLY LOOKING AT THAT KIND OF THE BROAD MEAN THE RESPONSIBILITY AND AND GOVERNANCE OF OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS SO. AT THE BOARD GOVERNING BOARD MEETINGS -- FOR MEETING WITH THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE THE BOARDS TO MEET WITH THE DEPARTMENT UPON OUR REQUEST -- AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A NEED IN THE RARE EVENT THAT TO DO THAT WITHOUT ANY REGIONAL CENTER. STAFF THAT THAT WOULD BE MET BY THE BOARD UPON THE DEPARTMENTS REQUEST. THE NEXT ITEM IS THE GOVERNING WORDS -- EXPERTISE LOOKING AT ENHANCING THE EXPERTISE OF THE GOVERNING BOARDS RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR KIND OF THE FISCAL OR FINANCIAL EXPERTISE THIS WOULD BE ADDING THAT ELEMENT -- BUT ALSO THEN PROVIDING THE REGIONAL CENTERS THEY HAVE -- WITHIN STATUTE A REQUIREMENT FOR MANAGEMENT BUT IT WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO USE MANAGEMENT OR SOMEBODY WHO HAS -- EXPERIENCE IN -- BOARD GOVERNANCE. THE NEXT ITEM IS LEGAL COUNSEL REGARDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT WHEN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL ON THAT THAT COUNCIL IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SO. KIND OF EXTENDING SOME CONFLICT OF INTEREST MAKING SURE THAT WERE FREE OF CONFLICT AND THAT THERE IS -- AT REPRESENTATION TO THE GOVERNING BOARDS THAT IS DOES NOT HAVE THE CONFLICT TO BEING AN EMPLOYEE OF THE REGIONAL CENTER. THE NEXT ITEM IS FOR CONSUMER SAFETY -- LOOKING TO EXTEND BACKGROUND CHECKS -- WELL MANY OF THE LICENSE SETTINGS THEY ALL HAVE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO BACKGROUND CHECKS MANY OF THE NON LICENSE SETTINGS DO NOT. SO WITH THE RELATION WITH THE RATE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT EXTENDING BACKGROUND CHECKS TO THOSE -- SERVICES THAT ARE TARGETED FOR INCREASES THAT DON'T ALREADY HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS WITHIN THOSE TARGETED SERVICES -- WE HAVE THE FAMILY HOME AGENCY AND COMMUNICATE FACILITIES THAT DO HAVE -- EITHER STATUTORY OR REGULATORY -- REQUIREMENTS THAT SET THOSE BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS THIS WOULD EXTENDED TO SUPPORTED LIVING AND THEN ALSO TO SOME OF THE SUPPORT SERVICES. HEALTH AND SAFETY -- THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE DIRECTOR TO BE ABLE TO ISSUE GUIDANCE TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A NEED TO ESTABLISH A KIND OF A STATE WIDE HEALTH AND SAFETY. PROTECTION -- AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE IF THERE IS AN INSTANCE IF THERE'S A PROVIDER THAT IS A MULTIPLE REGIONAL CENTERS AND FOR SOME REASON THERE'S A NEED TO GO AHEAD AND SAY WE NEED TO HAVE SOME -- VISITS TO THE HOMES TO ASSURE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT COULD BE DONE FROM A DIRECTIVE AS AN APARTMENT -- TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE THAT STATE WHITENESS AS OPPOSED TO REGIONAL CENTERS -- CERTAINLY THEY'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE SAFETY IS THERE BUT THERE MAY BE TIMES WHEN THERE'S A ISSUE THAT'S OCCURRING WITH ONE REGIONAL CENTER IN THE NORTH THAT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTERS MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IT. THIS -- IS GIVING A BIG PICTURE -- VANTAGE POINT FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE AND ASSURING SAFETY FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY -- THE NEXT OE IS FOR SERVICE PROVIDER QUALITY IS THAT IN THE INSTANCE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE SUBMITTING CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO PROVIDERS FOR AREAS OF CORRECTION. THAT WE WOULD BE RECEIVING AS A DEPARTMENT THOSE COPIES -- WITHIN THEIR RE ORGANIZATION WE HAVE A NEW RISK MANAGEMENT QUALITY MANAGEMENT -- OFFICE IF YOU WILL AND THIS WOULD HELP INFORM THAT OFFICE AS TO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE WE CAN ENHANCE WHETHER IT'S TRAININGS ARE OTHER PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WERE AWARE OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE STATEWIDE SO WE CAN MOVE IMPORTANT POLICIES FORWARD. THE LAST ITEM IS NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS WE DO THE ANNUAL WE HAVE THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATOR SURVEYS AND DIFFERENT CYCLES AS FAR AS COHORTS -- IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE WE WOULD BE -- ASKING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS -- TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS OF DISCUSSION THAT WOULD BE PRESENTED AT THEIR BOARD. MEETINGS AND THEN THEY WOULD -- REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OUTCOMES OF THOSE MEETINGS AND THE PLAN TO ADDRESS ANY AREAS THAT THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED AS A REGIONAL CENTER COMMUNITY TO FOR AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT. THANK YOU EL AL. SENATE PETTITTE KALLIO -- THE THE LANGUAGE -- FOR THIS TRAILER BILL WAS JUST CAME OUT LAST NIGHT AND WE JUST SAW THE FACT SHEET THE OTHER DAY SO -- WE WE ARE STILL REVIEWING THIS BUT SOME OF OUR INITIAL COMMENTS I JUST LIKE TO MAKE FOUR POINTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AS WE AS WE ANALYZE THIS PROPOSAL BUT INITIALLY -- WE THINK THEY ADDED OVERSIGHT OF REGIONAL CENTERS IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA THERE A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS IN THIS IN THIS PROPOSAL TO HELP REGIONAL CENTERS BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE STATE. STATES FUNDS -- AND TO INCLUDE PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IT DOES INCREASE THE WORKLOAD OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS BUT IT COMES WITH A PROPOSAL. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS FOR THAT WORKLOAD SO THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING -- OUR THIRD POINT WOULD JUST BE THAT -- WITH THIS ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SOME IDEAS FOR HOW TO COLLABORATE WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS ON SOME OF THESE. YOU KNOW ISSUES THAT CROP UP AS PROBLEMS -- AND REALLY MAKE IT SORT OF IN IT -- IT INTEREST TO HAVE CONTINUOUS LEARNING PROCESS SO THAT IT'S NOT ALL PUNITIVE IT'S LIKE WORKING TOGETHER TO TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. AND THEN OUR LAST POINT WOULD BE THIS PROPOSAL ALSO COMES WITH SOME ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT IN JANUARY -- THE DEPARTMENT DID REQUEST FIFTY FOUR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TWENTY FIVE OF WHICH WOULD BE DOING OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS AS WELL WE UNDERSTAND THAT. THIS MIGHT BE NEW WORKLOAD BUT I'M OUR OFFICE IS STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT SOME OF THESE NEW TASKS COULD NOT BE ABSORBED BY A THOSE. NEW POSITIONS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY REQUESTED. OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE. QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS-- COUPLE QUESTIONS SIR COMMENTS SO FIRST OF ALL -- REGARDING THE THE PROPOSAL -- MENTION A DASHBOARD -- CONTRACT REPORTING -- IS THERE. ARE SO WAS THE LEGISLATURE EXPRESS IT'S A STRONG DESIRE TO SEE WE ADDRESS THE DISPARITY ISSUE AND I THINK THIS CONCERNS NOT SUFFICIENT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. ARE WE GOING. TO AND WE INCORPORATE -- STANDARDS -- FOR ADDRESS -- FOR THAT TO ELIMINATE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THIS [inaudible] ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE. YES SIR WHERE -- THE WE DO HAVE WITHIN -- OUR DASHBOARD AND WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT POSTING OF SOME OF THE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE FOR DISPARITY WE DO HAVE THAT IN THERE -- I'D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK BUT I'M PRETTY SURE WE HAVE -- WITHIN OUR DASHBOARD -- THE THE THE DISPARITIES PEACE AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN ENHANCE THAT AND BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. WE'RE DOING THE COMPARISONS AND THE MEASURES AND TRACKING OKAY ON THAT AS WELL AND A A VAIO IT DASHBOARDS AND MONITORING IS GOOD I POINTED OUT FOR SOME OTHER AGENCIES WE ALSO NEED MINIMUM STANDARDS PERFORMANCE. SO ARE WE GOING TO WORK ON THAT AS WELL SO IT'S I MEAN. THREE WERE MONITORING IN SOMEONE'S DOING POORLY AND WE GO ALL THEY'RE DOING POORLY. AND THEY'RE DOING POORLY AGAIN AND ARE DOING POORLY AGAIN SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE NEED. TO BUY CERTAINLY -- AGREE WITH LA -- FIRST APPROACH SHOULD BE WHAT CAN KIND OF ASSISTANCE WE CAN GIVE YOU TO IMPROVE BUT AN ORGANIZATION OF PERSISTENTLY DOES NOT IMPROVE. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CONSEQUENCES. OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER PIECES THAT. YOU KNOW IT AT A PREVIOUS HEARING -- WAS DISTURBED TO HEAR SOME PEOPLE INDICATE THERE'S SOME ISSUES AROUND PEOPLE THEN FEEL FREE TO EXPRESSED PROBLEMS -- SO AGAIN FOR ACCOUNTABILITY I DON'T KNOW WE NEED TO HAVE SOME MECHANISMS BY WHICH IF SOMEONE DOESN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE. REPORTING WHAT THEY PERCEIVE THE PROBLEMS AND AGAIN THAT NOW REQUIRES INVESTIGATION WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE REALITY IS. THAT THERE ARE WE HAVE THOSE MECHANISMS -- THE THAT SAID THEY'RE NOT JUST REPORTING TO THE SAME GET OUT THERE NOT COMPLAIN TO THE SAME CENTER TODAY NOW DEPENDENT ON FOR SERVICES ARE APPLYING FOR SERVICES FROM SO -- WITHERED AS MECHANISM FOR GOING THROUGH THE STATE -- ARE IN A BUG'S MEN TYPE SYSTEM WHERE BASICALLY THEY KNOW THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING TO IS NOT THE SAME PERSON WHO'S GONNA AND THEN ALSO HAVE CONTROL OVER. OUR IT HAS RELATIONSHIP DOWN THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEN MAKES THAT THE BASICALLY THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THINGS -- WITHOUT FEAR -- OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED WE DON'T TO STILL AT THAT AND THE FINAL THROUGH THE PROBLEM IS BUT I THINK AS FAR AS ACCOUNTABILITY -- I THINK SOUNDS IT SEEMS TO ME I'M HEARING A LOT AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT -- THAT THE PARTS DEPARTMENT ALSO LOOKING INTO. YESTERDAY AND CERTAINLY MANY OF THE POINTS THAT THAT THAT YOU HAD IDENTIFIED AS FAR AS AREAS OF CONCERN AND AND WE AGREED THAT. THE THE DISCUSSION THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY WITH REGIONAL CENTERS THIS COMES ALSO WITHIN THE REORGANIZATION IS REALLY KIND OF THAT. THAT MERRY BRINGING TOGETHER MERGING OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE WORKING WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE YOU KNOW CAN HELP IMPROVE. SHARE BEST PRACTICES THINGS THAT ARE GOING FORWARD BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHEN THERE ARE THAT THE THE PROBLEMS THAT CONCERNS OR A DRESSING. UP A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IF IF FAMILIES ARE FEELING INTIMIDATED TO ASK FOR HELP WHERE DO THEY GO. SO REALLY WITHIN CANADA THAT STEMS KIND OF THE THOUGHT OF DOING THAT INTAKE PACKET AS AN EXAMPLE IS THAT EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE INFORMATION AS TO WHAT THE SERVICES ARE. PHONE NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN CALL THAT IS BOTH WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER BECAUSE MANY TIMES. YOU KNOW THINGS CAN BE RESOLVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES IF NOT WHAT OF THOSE OTHER PHONE NUMBERS WHERE THE FAMILY OR THE CONSUMER CAN ACCESS. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT THAT CONVERSATION THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH SO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THEIR INPUT AS WERE DEVELOPING NOT. SO FROM THE FAMILY'S PERSPECTIVE WHAT IS KIND OF A HELPFUL. PACKET THAT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW FULL OF NICE PICTURES BUT IT REALLY IS INFORMATIVE TO HELP THEM BE ABLE TO GET TO SOME OF THOSE POINTS THAT WERE HEARING AS WELL. AND AND JUST ONE LAST THING ON THE PERFORMANCE PIECE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S PART OF THE CHANGES OF THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACT IS THAT CURRENTLY WE'RE REPORTING AN IMPROVEMENT FROM YEAR OVER YEAR. SO IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW A HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE -- COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND YOU HAVE A HUNDRED ONE THE NEXT YEAR THAT SHOWING PROGRESS SO TO SPEAK. WE WOULD BE CHANGING THAT AND SAYING THAT LET'S ESTABLISH A GOAL WHAT IS THE GOAL FOR THE YOU KNOW THAT NEXT YEAR SO IT'S A MEANINGFUL GOLD IT'S AN INFORMED GOAL AND THEN MEASURING TO TO THOSE PIECES SO WE WOULD BE. THOSE ALL OF THOSE AREAS ARE THE PIECES THAT OVER. THE IMPLEMENTATION THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACT IMPLEMENTING SOME STANDARDIZE PRACTICES IMPLEMENTING OUR OUR REORGANIZATION AND AND DOING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DURING THE CORRECTIVE ACTION BUT THEN ALSO SHARING BEST PRACTICES. IS GOING TO BE UP AT PRETTY IMPORTANT TIME RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THANK YOU AND YES ERTAINLY WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING VERY HARD FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS IN A REGIONAL CENTERS -- BUT I ALSO PERCEIVES -- THAT WE MAY HAVE -- AND UNDERLYING CHALLENGE WITH TYPICALLY PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE COMMUNITIES -- THEY'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM WE ALREADY KNOW THEIR STIGMA ISSUES AROUND DOLLY MENTAL HEALTH BUT DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES GET TIED UP INTO THAT -- THEN THERE'S LANGUAGE BARRIERS CULTURAL BARRIERS -- PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS AND SO FORTH AND WELL AND AND WE WE CAN'T JUST SIMPLY SAY WELL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT WE NEED WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SERVE THOSE FAMILIES I THINK THE DISPARITY ISSUE SHOWS SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES DOING THAT THEY DIED THEY DON'T. FEEL WELCOME DATE THERE AT SO. THIRD THAT CALLS FOR SOME CULTURE CHANGE NOT SAYING THAT CENTERS ARE WORKING VERY HARD. AND AND DOING THEIR BEST -- BUT I THINK THAT WE DO NEED TO LOOK STRUCTURALLY AT THE NATURE OF WHAT HOW THOSE INTERACTIONS HAPPEN WITH PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE COMMUNITIES DEFER YEAH AND AND AND DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND EXPERIENCES -- IN MANY WAYS ACTUALLY WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE THESE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES I DON'T SEE OUR UNIQUE BUT YOU KNOW WE TRY TO BE A LEADER -- BUT THAT ALSO MEANS PEOPLE COME FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE OUR EXPECTATION AND WE NEED. TO HELP EDUCATE THEM AND BE ABLE TO BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. YEAH AND AND AGAIN SENATOR WE WE SHARE THAT THE IMPORTANCE AND WE CAN'T SLOW DOWN ON OUR EFFORTS. ON THAT IMPORTANT TOPIC YOU KNOW AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE BEEN DOING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK AND AS FAR AS ADDRESSING. KIND OF INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES AND IT SAY A MARATHON. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AT AND PRIORITIZE AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO THAT WE STARTED YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE SOME SOME TRAINING BRINGING AND GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY WITH SOME EXPERTISE AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND LINGUISTIC. YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO DO THAT TRAINING WE DONE THE TRAINING WITH ALL REGIONAL CENTERS MANY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE EXTENDED THAT TO BRING THAT. TO THEIR SERVICE COORDINATORS TO TALK ABOUT THOSE REALLY KEY AND AND CRITICAL ISSUES ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THOSE CULTURAL BARRIERS -- SO WE WE DON'T PLAN ON LETTING UP THE GAS PEDAL ON THAT -- IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S A A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO TO WORK ITH OUR COMMUNITY ON THOSE IMPORTANT AREAS.

SO YEAH SO TO CLARIFY I'M I'M NOT STE I AM HAPPY TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH OUR OUR COLLEAGUE SAID AT DRC ABOUT THE THE CHILDREN IT IS NOT. AN ADMISSION FOR CHILDREN INTO CANYON SPRINGS AND I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IT'S NOT INCREASING THE CAPACITY. THAT IT ACTUALLY WOULD RETAIN OUR CURRENT BECAUSE CAPACITY WERE NOT ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR STAFFING ON THIS IS JUST ACTUALLY JUST A STATUTORY CHANGE TO ALLOW FOR ADMISSIONS. AGAIN IN THOSE RARE INSTANCES WHEN WE WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT. IT'S NOT ASKING TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND -- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN OUR STARS SERVICES STAIN AND STAR SERVICES PASSED THAT THIRTEEN MONTHS IT WOULD GIVE HOWEVER IN ANY OF OUR STARS WERE NOT TALKING IS AN ISOLATION AT CANYON SPRINGS IT COULD BE. NOR STARS SOUTH START OUR SOON TO BE CENTRAL STARK IF FOR CONTINUES STABILIZATION IT'S NEEDED. THAT THIS WOULD BE AN AREA IN WHICH WE COULD ACCESS AS FAR AS ADMISSION INTO CANYON SPRINGS BUT AGAIN IT DOES NOT INCREASE THE CAPACITY WE'RE NOT ASKING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE -- CHILDREN ADMITTED THERE THAT SAID WE DO REALIZE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE NEEDS FOR CHILDREN THAT WE HAVE WITH VERY COMPLEX NEEDS WITH CO OCCURRING. AND THERE'S THAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE THREE HOMES WE COMMITTEE CRISIS HOMES BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP MORE. SO WE WE DO HAVE YEAH THIS IS A PIECE OF MANY THINGS BUT IS AN ELEMENT THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TO HAVE. CURRENTLY TO SERVE A VERY SMALL POPULATION THAT THAT NEEDS SERVICES.

A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHER AND COMMITTEE STAFF -- I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES THE GENERAL FUND NEUTRAL PROGRAM. OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD WE PROPOSE TO FIND A STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM UTILIZING INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY REVENUES. COMPARED TO INITIAL ESTIMATE SURE TO CONVERSE BUDGET WE NOW ESTIMATE. ESTIMATE HELD ZERO NEWS -- OF APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION OVER THE THREE YEAR FORECAST PERIOD THIS IS ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION LESS THAN PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED -- SPECIFICALLY THE MEMBER VISION PROPOSES GENERAL FUND ALLOCATIONS OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION IN. NINETEEN TWENTY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO COMPARE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND PREVIOUSLY WAS -- TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO SIX ON A PERSONAL FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL -- THEY WERE ALSO PROPOSING SOME TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- BASED ON MODELING PROVIDED BY COVER CALIFORNIA WE ASSUME THIS PROPOSAL WILL RESULT IN EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING STATE ASSISTANCE. AND RESULT IN A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND NEW ENROLLEES AND NEARLY INDIVIDUAL NEWLY COVERED UNDER INSURANCE. ON AVERAGE WE ASSUME INDIVIDUALS BELOW 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WILL. RECEIVE MONTHLY SUBSIDIES OF ABOUT TEN DOLLARS. IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THEY ALREADY RECEIVE. ON AVERAGE WE ASSUME INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED SIX ARE PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. WILL RECEIVE MONTHLY SUBSIDIES OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED MILLION. OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH -- DENOUNCE MAY VERY SIGNIFICANTLY BASED ON INDIVIDUALS HEALTHCARE COSTS. TO TERMINA BY THE REGION AGE HOUSEHOLD SIZE AND INCOME. OF FOR COVERAGE EARS TWO ONE THREE WERE PROPOSING TO MODIFY THE PROGRAM DESIGNED. TO ROUGHLY MAINTAIN THAT AVERAGE MONTHLY PREMIUM AMOUNT FROM YOUR ONE INTO YOUR TO WHEN YOU'RE. THREE IF WE DO NOT MODIFY THE PROGRAM DESIGN YOUR TO WHEN YOU'RE THREE OF BASED OFF MAILLET PROVIDE A COVER CALIFORNIA WE ASSUME COSTS WILL GROW BY UP 230% FOR THE OVER POPULATION. THIS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED ATTRIBUTED -- TO THE INCREASE IN PREMIUMS. OUTPACED THE INCREASE IN PERSONAL INCOME GROWTH THEREFORE THE STATE SHARE OF COSTS FOR THOSE PREMIUMS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED INCREASE MORE RAPIDLY -- DUE TO THOSE DIFFERENT GROWTH RATES -- REGARDING THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA -- ONE PROPOSING THIS SUBSIDY PROGRAM WE INTENDED TO CREATE A BUDGET NEUTRAL PROGRAM. WHILE PROVIDING MEANINGFUL MEANINGFUL SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE NO FEDERAL ASSISTANCE SO INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN FOUR AND SIX ARE PERCENT THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. BASED OFF THE MODELING PROVIDE A COVER CALIFORNIA. WE HAD TO PROVIDE AT LEAST OF THE AVAILABLE REVENUES TO THIS POPULATION TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL BENEFIT -- IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WILL BE PAYING THE PENALTY WE ESTIMATE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WILL PAY THE PENALTY IN. NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEWER THAN IF THE FEDERAL PENALTY HAD REMAINED IN PLACE AND TWENTY TWENTY THAT NUMBER AGAIN. APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS PAY THE PENALTY. WHICH IS A HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEWER THAN IF THE FEDERAL PENALTY HAD REMAINED IN PLACE -- BEYOND THAT WE STILL PROPOSED TO SUNSET THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM AFTER THREE YEARS AND MAINTAIN THE PANEL THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY. ON GOING WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE PENALTY ITSELF HAS AFFECTS ON COVERAGE AND HELPS TO MAINTAIN AFFORDABILITY IN THE MARKET BROADLY. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU -- X. ANY COMMENTS FROM COVER CALIFORNIA. A MYTH OKAY HELLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF PROVIDE JUST A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS FIRST -- WE'RE STILL -- REVIEWING THE ADMINISTRATION'S AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE COUNTY REVENUE ESTIMATES -- HOPING TO RECEIVE -- SOME DETAILED. BACK UP ON WHAT THE ASSUMPTIONS WERE THAT WENT INTO THAT BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY -- CONCERNS THEY APPEAR GENERALLY REASONABLE AT THIS TIME -- BUT WOULD KNOW THAT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY -- ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT -- AS WE HAVE MENTIONED ON OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT INVOLVES SUNSETS. AND THIS DOES RAISE SOME CONCERNS -- IN PARTICULAR AND SUN SETTING THESE SUBSIDIES WHILE THE PENALTY REVENUES CONTINUE COULD. UNDERSTATE THE TRUE ONGOING COSTS -- OF THE PROGRAM AM GIVEN PRESSURES THAT THIS WOULD CREATE -- TO CONTINUE THEM. AND LASTLY WE JUST KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY AT THIS POINT TO PROVIDE ITS INPUT ON THE ALLOCATION OF THE THE COUNTY REVENUES SHOULD CHOOSE TO LIMIT THEM -- TO THE COUNTY REVENUES BETWEEN THE ABOVE 4100% BELOW 4% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL -- THRESHOLD SO PLEASURE COULD FOR EXAMPLE CHOOSE TO ALLOCATE RELATIVELY GREATER SHARE TO THOSE BELOW AND SHOULD IT SHOULD HAVE A PRIORITY. THANK YOU -- SO JUST TO THE HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF SO IN JANUARY -- THE IDEA WAS IS THAT YOU TAKE THE PENALTY MONEY AND THEN IF IT TURNS OUT YOU SPEND MORE YOU CALL SOMEBODY FOR THE FUTURE YEARS SAID -- IN THIS CASE WE'RE NOW PROPOSING A MORE CONSISTENT I MEAN I REALIZE THERE'S SOME PROTECTION THE FUTURE BUT A THERE'S GONNA BE MORE CERTAINTY ABOUT FROM YOU AT LEAST WELL FROM YEAR TO YEAR QUALITIES UNTIL SUNSET. OF THE LEVEL SUBSIDY CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT THE INTERNET THE PROBLEM PROVIDE THAT TEN DOLLAR AVERAGE MONTHLY SUBSIDY AND THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS AVERAGE MONTHLY SUBSIDY THROUGHOUT THE THREE COVERAGE PERIODS OF THREE YEARS. SO I I DO APPRECIATE ACT I THINK IT'S JUST TO TO HAVE IT SWING YOU KNOW AT THE NEEDS GREAT ONE THE GOOD YEARS BUT IF THE TAP AT SWING THAT BLACK PREDICTABLY I THINK WILL. BE PROBLEMATIC FOR TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO BUY INSURANCE IF THEY DON'T KNOW. HEALTH ONE YEAR IT'S NOT SO GOOD AND AND THEN THEY DROP OUT IT'S HARD TO ITEM -- YEAH NEXT YEAR GOT BETTER SO PLEASE COME BACK ON AND AND SO FORTH -- IS THERE AGAIN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE MODELING SORE GUESSING INTO THE FUTURE -- IF IF FOR FALLING A LITTLE SHORT. LET'S SAY OUR TO SEE MORE PEOPLE NEEDED SUBSIDIES GIVEN THAT THAT LEVEL THEN -- THE PENALTY CAME IN -- AGAIN I'D RELIGIOUS MORE ABOUT TENSIONS ANYTHING ELSE IS -- THE POLICY WISE THE GOAL STILL WOULD BE TO TRY TO MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL WILL FIVE C. F. F. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TO BE. THROWN A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY TO CLOSE THAT GAP OR WHATEVER CORRECT I BELIEVE THE INTENT IS TO MAINTAIN THAT AVERAGE TEN AREN'T AVERAGE ONE HUNDRED MONTH. DOLLAR MONTHLY SUBSIDY HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO THE INTENT TO MAINTAIN A BUDGET NEUTRAL PROGRAM OVER THE THREE OR FOUR EIGHT US PURITAN SO DEPENDING ON THE VARIATIONS WITHIN THE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE AMOUNT AND THE EXPANDERS ABOUT THAT MAY. REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS IN YOUR TO WHEN YOU'RE THREE AGAIN AS NOTED WE ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE ADJUSTMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AGAIN WE HAVE. THE THE INTENT IS TO MAINTAIN A BUDGET NEUTRAL PROGRAM OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO I I PRAY SHOULD JUST MENTION THAT -- THAT. I THINK -- I APPRECIATE THE THE PROPOSAL'S BETTER DOLLARS BEFORE OR ICE STILL THINK THAT WE SHOULD IT'S NOT -- SUFFICIENT -- THE LEVEL SUBSIDY WE SHOULD CONSIDER MORE BUT I APPRECIATE SO I CLARIFY WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS. AND THEN -- THEN OF AYE FROM I UNDERSTAND BASED ON THIS PROPOSAL -- WHEN YOU GO FROM RECOGNIZE THAT -- Là THE MONEY'S GOING TO THE PEOPLE OF FOUR HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED BUT SAME TIME THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE FEDERAL SUBSIDY I OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS SO YOU HAVE. STATES MAKING UP THE ENTIRE GAP. THEN -- BEFORE THE FIVE HUNDRED BASICALLY AT 17%. RIGHT SO BASICALLY CAM AT 70% INCOME AND THAT. AND THEN UP TO TWENTY TWO AND A HALF. AT 5100%. THE PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW IS A FOUR HUNDRED CAP AT NINE POINT 78% OF INCOME LIKE A FOUR HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CAP AT 17% OKAY NOT FIVE HUNDRED CAP AT TWENTY TWO POINT 5%. AND A SIX HUNDRED CAP AT 25% QUE ALL RIGHT SO SO WHAT DOES RECOGNIZE THAT -- WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF SOMEONE'S INCOME I APPRECIATE THE SUBSIDY HELPS -- IT'S A LOT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE. IN YOUR FIFTIES JUROR -- AT NO THE RATE SINCE THERE'S NO LIMIT RIGHT NOW JUMPS WAY OUT I MEAN THIS IS CERTAINLY BETTER MUCH BETTER BUT THEN JUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OF SOMEONE'S INCOME SO IT'S NOT A SMALL AMOUNT. FOR IN TERMS OF FOR A DESPITE THE SUBSIDY OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY OKAY AND THEN -- ALL RIGHT SO WELL ZERO PUBLIC COMMENT. A NEW THERE SOME PEOPLE COME UP ON THIS. I'LL BE DISAPPOINTED IF I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE COME UP ON THIS ONE OKAY WELCOME. WE WOULD AS WELL MISTER CHAIR BETH CAPELL ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS -- LIKE YOU MISTER CHAIR WE APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. IN SOME RESPECTS IMPROVED OVER THE JANUARY PROPOSAL BUT IN OTHERS -- NOT HAS NOT BEEN THE JANUARY WE APPRECIATE THAT THE MONEY THEY HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS RELATIVELY LEVEL AND THE HELP THAT CONSUMERS GET IS RELATIVELY LOW. LEVEL AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS SURE LEGISLATION DOES AS WELL AS HOWEVER THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS RATHER THAN ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS THE JANUARY PROPOSAL WAS THE JANUARY OR PROPOSAL WAS SERIOUSLY UNDER FUNDED. THIS IS EVEN MORE SERIOUSLY UNDER FUNDED THEY THE IDEA THAT ANYONE SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO SPEND 25% OF THEIR INCOME ON PREMIUMS IS SIMPLY ASTONISHING. IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR HEALTH ACCESS TO SAY THAT WE SUPPORTED A PROPOSAL. AS THE JANUARY BUDGET WOULD HAVE DONE THAT LIMITED PREMIUMS WERE KNOWS HOUSE TO SUPPORT SOMETHING WITH TWENTY AT 25% IS -- ASTONISHING WERE ALSO VERY TROUBLED THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT PROVIDE HELP BELOW 2100% OF POVERTY WE HAVE PEOPLE LIVING ON TWELVE HUNDRED OR IS FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ASKED TO PAY TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY DOLLARS FOR PREMIUMS. IF THEY WERE ON MEDI CAL THEY WOULD PAY NOTHING WE SHOULD HAVE BE ABLE TO HELP THE PEOPLE BELOW. TWO HUNDRED AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE ABOVE. WE ALSO REMAIN TROUBLED THAT THERE'S A SUNSET FOR THE AFFORDABILITY HELP BUT NOT FOR THE MANDATE. WE ALSO ARE PERPLEXED AT THE INSISTENCE ON RECONCILIATION FOR THOSE WHO TAX RECONCILIATION FOR THOSE ARE GETTING TEN DOLLARS A MONTH OF HELP. AND LIKE YOU MISTER CHAIR WE AGREE THAT INCLUDING HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IS IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND WE HOPE WE CAN GET THAT RESOLVED IN THE COMPANY IN THE TRAILER BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY BUT DE DO BELIEVE THE AFFORDABILITY IS. ASSISTANCE IS INSUFFICIENT PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS THOSE MAKING LESS THAN 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. UP ANY REINSTATEMENT OF THE PENALTY SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS THESE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. AS SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE PAYING THE PENALTY BUT RECEIVE NO STATE SUBSIDIES. IN ADDITION THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE PRICE SENSITIVE AND MORE LIKELY TO ROLL AND ROLE AND COVERED CALIFORNIA WITH ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. I WE SHARE THE CONCERNS RELATED TO THE SUBSIDIES SUN SETTING IN THREE YEARS BUT THE PENALTY CONTINUING IN PERPETUITY. AS WELL AS SHARE CONCERNS REGARDING THAT HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRIES. IN ADDITION WE ALSO -- WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT -- THERE BE -- THE THEY'RE NOT BE RECONCILIATION FOR RENDERING VISUALS MAKING ARE RECEIVING AND TEN DOLLARS A MONTH THOSE -- BY TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED AND AND ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO PAY THE PENALTY IN AREA BE PROVIDED AN APPROPRIATE REFINED. AND FINALLY IN TERMS OF THE INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM WHICH WE DO BELIEVE THE DEFINITION SHOULD INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SUBSIDIES TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO WRONG DOOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AUTUMN OGDEN SMITH WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK AND WE WE WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF YOU MISTER CHAIR AND HEALTHAXIS IN WESTERN CENTER -- YOU KNOW FROM THE CANCER PERSPECTIVE IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE BRING DOWN COSTS AS MUCH AS WE CAN. PATIENTS NEED ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOR THEIR MEDICATIONS AND THEIR TREATMENT AND WITH. 25% OF THEIR INCOME GOING TO THE TO THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IT'S IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO AFFORD ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT TO GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS FURTHER AND THE LEGISLATURE STORY LIBERAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS A WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A STATE BASED INDIVIDUAL SHARED RESPONSIBILITY REQUIREMENT -- IN USING THAT PROGRAM TO FIND ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES FOR ADDITIONAL POPULATIONS -- THIS WITH THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY AND HELP -- PROVIDING CERTAINTY IN THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN STABILIZES PREMIUMS -- AND AND MAKES HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE FROM OUR POPULATIONS UNIT WERE WELCOME TO BE A CONSTRUCTIVE PART OF ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT -- HOW THE SHEEP SABAH WERE WERE WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF OF GETTING THIS ENACTED AT THE STATE LEVEL THANK YOU? THANK YOU. WELCOME. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. AND WE ARE GENERALLY IN SUPPORT OF PREMIUM ASSISTANCE BUT WE DO SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT YOU OUTLINED EARLIER [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY SO -- SO FIRST OF ALL AGAIN WHAT THANK THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP -- ON AND THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE I REALIZE IT'S FIGHT BOUT THE MOST POPULAR PIECE BUT IT. IS THE COMPANION TO THE SUBSIDY TO ME THEY COME TOGETHER RIGHT AND THE PROBLEM IS IF WE DON'T GET MORE PEOPLE TO THE PULL THAT ACTUALLY TRIED TO PREMIUMS. PREMIUMS DRIVE UP THAT MEANS EVEN MORE MONEY WE HAVE TO FIND FOR SUBSIDIES RIGHT SO I MEAN THEY GO TOGETHER -- AND I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP ON THAT -- I A THE WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE THE ESSENTIALLY THE EXPIRATION DATE -- AND SO AND UNTROUBLED THE EFFORT OUT POSITION I'M. TROUBLED BY THAT AS WELL -- IN ME WILL BE COLLECTING -- BERKELEY COLLECTING A PENALTY -- BASED ON THE PEOPLE NOT INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THAT SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO HIS PROPOSED -- AT LEAST -- YELL TO HELPING PEOPLE GET INSURANCE -- AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE CAN PERSUADE THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY THE GREATEST SUCCESS WOULD BE IS THAT WOULD NO ONE ACTUALLY GETS PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL GONE INTO THE INSURANCE POOL. SO -- THAT DOES THAT WOULD BE THE IDEAL BUT BUT CERTAINLY IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WE'RE COLLECTING PENALTIES FROM I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD JUST. GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND AFTER CERTAIN DATES FOR JUST GET NOW WITH THAT. WASHED OUT -- I THINK THE OTHER PART AND WE LOOK AT THIS OF THE RECORD YOU KNOW CERTAINLY FOR THE 13322100% -- WELL CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE -- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT TO LOOK AT THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT AND THEN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE EXAMPLE THE TOP AND SO -- SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A FORTY FIFTY YEARS 17% OF YOUR INCOME UP 225% THE CENTER AND THAT'S JUST FOR PREMIUMS. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE. COST SHARE THAT THIRTY SO YOU PURCHASE THE INSURANCE. THAT'S THE PREVIOUS SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE DOING SOME SORT OF THESE ADS -- BUT LET US RECOGNIZE THAT A JURY SPENDING HAVE CANCER OR SOME OTHER CONDITION YOU'RE ALSO. THINK ABOUT YOUR SILVER PLAN IS. RIGHT. YOU PAINT 20% YEAH YOU GET YOU GET COST YEAR PART ON TOP OF THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUBSIDY FOR COST YEAR CORRECT IN THIS RIGHT SO THIS IS PURELY PREMIUMS. CLEARLY PREMIUMS ARE IMPORTANT BUT THIS. I THINK BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO USE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE AGAIN PEOPLE COVERAGE AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT YOU GOT YOUR COST YOUR PARTS OFYOUR EIGHTY TALKING ABOUT 25% FOR THE PREMIUM. NAY THROUGH THE CROSS YEAR ON TOP OF THAT I I THINK WE HAVE A CHALLENGE TELLING PEOPLE IT'S AFFORDABLE. SO I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND SAYING THAT BY THINK WE DO NEED TO DO MORE. ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE MARRYING THIS WITH THE THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE SELL -- SO AGAIN -- AS I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY THINK MORE ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT. WE'RE PUTTING IN OTHERWISE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING PEOPLE INTO A VERY. CHALLENGING POSITION. RIGHT AND THAT IN THAT REGARD. NO CHOICES 25% OF THE INCOME PAY THE PENALTY -- AND THEN IF THEY'RE NOT THE PULLED THEM OR US OR DEFEATING THE PURPOSE OF THE PENALTY IN THE FIRST PLACE RIGHT. SO I SELL AB -- SO CERTAINLY I HOPE SO I APPRECIATE THE SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS WE EE. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE ON THE SUBSIDY SIDE TO MAKE THE MANDATE SIDE MORE SUCCESS ONE IF WE SHOULD GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND I SUPPORT HIM. IN THAT AS WELL [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. I SHE COMMENTS ANY OTHER COMMENTS [inaudible] OBSERVERS AUTO. JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF CONVERTIBLE FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR AND HIS AND IS PLANNED -- BUT SPECIFICALLY I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED REGARDING FEES SUBSIDIES FOR THOSE UNDER. THE UP OVER THE TWO WAS A 2100% YEAH THE 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND I JUST OF THE COULD BE IN IT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NOT AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDIES THAT WOULD BE QUITE TO THAT COMMUNITY THERE. OKAY ANY. THE COMMENTS. IT IS THE ONLY COMMENT THAT I ADDRESSES THE CONSULATE TO PROPOSAL I THINK WE'VE THE EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF NOT HAVING RECONCILIATION INCLUDED IN THIS LANGUAGE. HOWEVER WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW WE COULD IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM WITHOUT RECONCILIATION FOR THE ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED POPULATE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FEEL POPULATION ALL BIFURCATING THE BELOW FOUR HUNDRED POPULATION OUT OF THOSE RECONCILIATION -- ACTIVITIES ESPECIALLY OF AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS 310050% F. FEEL WHEN THEY REPORT THEIR INCOME TO COVER CALIFORNIA AND ENDS UP WITH 41005% OF THE BILL INCOME IF YOU DON'T RECONCILE THE INDIVIDUALS PAYMENT. THEY MAY BE GETTING A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SUBSIDY THAN THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR OF COURSE THIS HAS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IF YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED TO ACTUALLY COMES IN. BELOW FOUR HUNDRED WE RECONCILE THAT PAYMENT LIKE THE RESULT AND OF A PRODUCTION ARE OF A PAYMENT TO THE STATE TO REPAIR THAT. THAT'S THE SUBSIDY OUR THAT PERSON WOULD STILL BE RECEIVING -- FEDERAL SUBSIDY WITHIN THEIR REFUND AND SO KIND OF OFFSET EACH OTHER SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE THE STICKING POINT THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH IS HOW CAN YOU. BY FOR KATE THAT RECONCILIATION PROCESS [inaudible] OKAY WELL -- WE WE HAVE SOME MORE WORK TO DO ON THIS ONE BUT AGAIN APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP -- THE ON THE BROADER POLICY BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN WE CAN. SOME OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS AND ALSO HOPEFULLY WE CAN AGREE ON A BOTTOM ON A BROADER SUBSIDY APPRECIATE I DO AGREE THAT WE USE THE PENALTY SHOULD GO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS OF THE BY THINK WHEN I DO MORE THAN JUST THE PENALTY SO. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BUDGETARY QUESTION SO WE CAN DEAL WITH OKAY ANYTHING ELSE ANY OTHER COMMENTS LA ONLY. COVERED CALIFORNIA NO OKAY THANK YOU FOR AGAIN WHAT THEY COVER CALIFORNIA FOR THE ANALYSIS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT.

AND LASTLY TO SUPPORT PRIMARY CARE PSYCHIATRY TRAINING AND FOR EMERGENCY AND PRIMARY CARE PRACTITIONERS -- THE STAFF ALSO ASKED US TO ADDRESS HOW THE WET FUNDING INTERACTS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. PROPOSE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET AND OTHER PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM BOTH PROPOSALS. SO THE KEY DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR HERE IS THAT THE WAY PLAN IS THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM -- WHERE AS THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE MORE BROADLY SO THERE ARE PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WOULD? BE MORE TARGETED TOWARDS PEOPLE WORKING OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR WHAT FUNDED PROGRAMS. AS THE KEYS FOR DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR [inaudible] HELLO. BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA L. -- MY DAD ONE OTHER SORT OF IMPORTANT DISTINCTION THAT WE THINK IS THERE -- THAT -- THEY'RE MORE SORT OF PIPELINE ACTIVITIES UNDER THE WEB PROPOSAL AS OPPOSED TO UNDER THE ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'D BE FOR EXAMPLE -- FUNDING FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCIES AND SO FORTH THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED UNDER THE THE HUNDRED DOLLAR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR WHAT PROPOSAL BUT NOT UNDER THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- SO WE FOLLOWING THE RELEASE THE MAY RELIGION -- REVISION -- RELEASED TO AN EMAIL ANALYSIS OF OF THE GOVERNOR NEWS PURPOSE AS GOVERNOR'S NEW PROPOSAL AND WE INTEND TO RELEASE A A POLICY POST IN THE COMING DAYS AS WELL -- THAT EXPANDS UPON THOSE COMMENTS AND IN OUR SYSTEM -- WE DO FIND THAT THERE IS MIXED EVIDENCE OF A STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGE -- SOME INDICATIONS AND PROJECTIONS TO SHOW SHORTAGE BUT OTHER DATA SUCH AS SALARY INCREASES IN RECENT YEARS AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH GRADUATES PARTICULARLY FROM -- NON PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND SO FORTH HAS INCREASED PRETTY MARKEDLY AND SO WE WE THINK WE FIND THE EVIDENCE OVERALL MIXED ON A STATE WIDE SHORTAGE. WE DO FIND HOWEVER REGIONAL DISPARITIES -- AMONG MENTAL HEALTH PRESS -- PROVIDERS SO ESPECIALLY IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY -- AND AS WELL AS THE INLAND EMPIRE THOSE ARE -- DO APPEAR TO BE EXPERIENCING MORE ACUTE SHORTAGES I SHOULD KNOW THAT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS WE DO FIND MORE EVIDENCE OF A OF A PSYCHIATRIC SHORTAGE -- WE ALSO FIND THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE EXTENT THAT EXISTING PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL -- ONE PIECE OF DATA THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS WHERE IN WHERE RECIPIENTS OF WET AWARDS WORK AFTER THEIR AFTER -- THEIR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COMPLETE AND FOUND THAT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN THE THAT WHERE THEY WORK AND WITH THE REGION'S THE STATE A QUICK SPINS THE MOST ACUTE SHORTAGES. FOR WE DO PROVIDE SOME OPTIONS AS WELL FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION FIRST WOULD BE TO TAKE PAUSE AND IDENTIFY THE STATE'S NEEDS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES -- FOR FOR ADDRESSING ANY STATEWIDE A REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. ANOTHER WOULD BE -- TO SCALE BACK FUNDING -- AND POTENTIALLY HERE REQUIRE LOCAL CONTRIBUTION HISTORICALLY -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED TO LOCALS -- FUNDED -- THE PREVIOUS WET PLANS -- WHEREAS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL IT WOULD INVOLVE ONLY STATE ADMINISTRATIVE DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER THE MHSAA SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER EITHER ALLOWING OR REQUIRING LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS. CURRENTLY UNDER THE IMAGE SAY THEY'RE ALLOWED -- TO DEDICATE UP 215% MAXIMUM -- TO MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AND SO THEY DO RECEIVE FUNDING ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO DO SO -- AND THEN ANOTHER OPTION WOULD JUST BE TO ESTABLISH A MORE DETAILED PARAMETERS ON HOW THE ALLOCATIONS ARE MADE SO IT'S TARGETED TO THE HIGHEST NEED AREAS TOWARDS THE HIGHER -- MOST HIGH NEED PROFESSIONS AND WE ALSO GIVE SOME OTHER EXAMPLES SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FINANCE. CLEAN CHANNEL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I WILL CONFINE OUR RESPONSE TO THE ALLO COMMENTS. REGARDING THE OPTIONS -- TO THE TO THE OPTIONS FOR DEALING A FUNDING AND REQUIRING A LOCAL CONTRIBUTION FROM -- AND DIVERT OUR COLLEAGUE THAT ARE SPREAD -- FOR THE WORK FOR SHORTAGE AND PROGRAM -- PROGRAMMATIC COMMENTS. US AND SEE WHAT PLAN FUNDING PROPOSAL ON FOOD STAMPS COSTS AND DOING FUNDING WOULD MEAN A PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES -- FOR THE WEB PLAN WOULD BE AN FUNDED AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THIS MAY PREVENT OFSHE BUT FROM. OF WORKING WITH AN HSA REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS ANOTHER KEY STAKE HOLDERS ON THE PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEXT FIVE YEAR PLAN. AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT A RE DIRECTING COUNTY -- AND THAT'S JUST A FEW DOLLARS A TO THE WEB PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE CHANGING STATUTORY LANGUAGE. AND AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. A TO CHANGE THE COUNTY ALLEGATIONS -- WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ON THE STATUE THAT DIRECTED THE COUNTY DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF WHAT -- HAS SUNSET AND COUNTIES NOT EXPECTING TO BE ASKED TO MATCH ANY NEW FUNDING -- AND COUNTIES HAVE LIKELY NOT BUDGETED FOR THIS CLASS AND THOSE DOLLARS MIGHT BE ALREADY EARMARKED FROM -- FOR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. UP SO ACTION IS SO IN TERMS OF OF WE'VE HAD WHAT. FOR WELL THE TEN YEAR HEALTH TOP TEN YEAR FIVE YEARS RIGHT SO THIS WILL BE THE THIRD FIVE YEAR PLAN STRAIGHT TO THE THIRD FIVE YEAR OKAY SO THAT YEAH SO -- AND I KNOW WE DID YOUR FAMILY OF SOME OF SO I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK -- VALUATIONS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND ACTUALLY LOOKING NOT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S MULTIPLE COMPONENTS IN HERE. LIKE SUB CONSERVE SO FOR EXAMPLE -- TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSERVED AREAS RIGHT. SORRY MY BACKGROUNDS AND WORK FORCE I DID WORKFORCE RESEARCH SO. CHALLENGES LIKE YOU FEEL SOMETHING AS YOU WILL SAY WELL LET'S JUST SHOVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN RIGHT INTO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE JUST HAVE A SHORTAGE BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE FOR DO THEY GO AND PUT A GO NOT SURPRISINGLY. IS DEPENDENT ON THE LABOR MARKET FOR THAT SO YOU CAN IF YOU DON'T IF IT UNDERSERVED AREAS DON'T HAVE POSITIONS. AND IT'LL HAVE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS COMPARED TO OTHER AREAS THEN PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO STAY EVEN IF YOU SELL. ANY YET RIGHT SO I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR A JOB AND YOU GO OKAY PAGE HERE AND THIS KIND OF YOUR LIVER HERE. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY MULTIPLE FACTORS GO IN PLACE SO -- AND SO I THINK. FOR EXAMPLE -- ONE LOOKS AT IN TERMS OF PLACEMENT -- WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW DO LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS FAIR RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS. USED TO PUT THE EMPHASIS ON SCHOLARSHIPS FOR THE PAID PEOPLE UP FRONT NAY REALIZE THAT ACTUALLY TO GET PEOPLE TO STAY YOU KNOW PEOPLE COME THEY DO THEIR APPLICATION WAS ACTUALLY TO GET LOAN REPAYMENT RIGHT. AND AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT BEYOND THE PIPELINE HOW THE PROVIDE THE KIND OF SUPPORTS FOR PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE AND THE MOST UNDERSERVED AREAS. SO SOLEMN HOPING THAT IS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS THAT THERE'S A SERVER. THIS BROADER COUNTY LOOKING AT THE KIND OF THAT THE AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE DATA ABOUT WHAT WILL WHICH PARTS OF THE PROGRAMMER. ARE MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL RAID SO I THINK LA -- JUST MENTION THE BILL FORTY PEOPLE INTO PRACTICING WHAT WHAT'S THE FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT RT RT PRACTICING IN THE UNDERSERVED AREAS ARE NOT. OF SOME OF THAT MAY REQUIRE SOME TIME IT'S FINE TUNING OF THE THE THE STRATEGY RIGHT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO PEOPLE PRACTICING IS THAT JOBS IS IT ACTUALLY SOMETIMES CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPOUSES. I MEAN THAT'S A FACTOR IN WORKFORCE MOST KNOWN PEOPLE GET MAIL. FORM RELATIONSHIPS MAYBE GET MARRIED THEY USUALLY NEED TO HAVE A CAREER FOR BOTH PEOPLE. AND SO HOW DO YOU TREAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT -- IT'S SO THAT COULD BE A DRIVING FACTOR -- WHAT KIND OF JOB SUPPORT SO WHAT IS IT HOW GOOD IS THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW AND FOR SEE HOW GOOD IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE? FOR HIRING PEOPLE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS RIGHT SO USE NOW YOU SPENT THE TIME YOU TRAIN YOUR SOCIAL WORKER YOU CHANGE PSYCHIATRISTS WHATEVER. IS IS THEIR COMPETITOR TO COMPETITORS ASIANS FOR THEM TO DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO AND UNDERSERVED AREAS SO. SO IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE TRAINING MORE PEOPLE -- THEN -- NOW SOMETIMES YOU'LL SAY WELL LOOK THERE'S A SHORTAGE IN THIS AREA -- AND THAT'S TRUE AND THEN THE QUESTIONS HOW YOU CAN HOW DO YOU RECRUIT AND KEEP PEOPLE THERE RIGHT -- SO IS SO I'M HOPING THAT. NO BRIGITTE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE BUT THAT. THERE'S AN ONGOING EVALUATION WE'VE HAD TEN YEARS FOR SAID SHOW US. WE'RE DOING WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO ANOTHER. SET HERE BY DOING BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IN THE END RIGHT. WE WANT TO BE SURE OF THE WE GET THOSE WE GET COMMUNITIES. SERVED RIGHT AND SO WE WILL I AM I THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE YOU KNOW HOW WE FINE TUNED OUR STRATEGY WORKERS TOWARD RESOURCES BEST DIRECTED TO GET THE KIND OF RESULTS WE WANT TO GET AND SO. THAT'S NOT JUST A VALUABLE PROGRAM BUT ALSO THE SUB PARTS OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT. THINGS HERE RADIO LOANS OPTIONS IF STATE AND AS YOU HAVE. IT SET RAIL TRAINING PROGRAMS ETCETERA SO -- SOME HOPING THAT WE CAN WE SHOULD BE ABLE CORPORATE THAT IS PART OF THE THE PROPOSAL TO BE SURE WE HAVE THE KIND INFORMATION AS WELL AS THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE HAD BEFORE. SO CURRENT. YES SO WE ARE WORKING ON MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION SYSTEM BUILT INTO THIS AS WELL AS I JUST SAID IT WITH THE LAST FIVE YEAR PLAN -- THE DATA THAT WE HAVE INDICATES THAT ACTUALLY 91% OF THE LOAN REPAYMENT RECIPIENTS REMAIN IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. I MEAN I I THINK THAT THAT ACTUALLY DOES SPEAK TO THAT THESE ARE AFFECTED PROGRAMS -- IN THE SHORT RUN I THINK. WAS THAT A LOT OF PAIN EIGHT EXACTLY AND TODAY THAT WE ARE OPEN TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS AND PART OF THE THE WAY THAT IS WHAT PLAN IS FRAME IS THAT REALLY IT'LL BE TAILORED TO THE REGIONAL NEEDS -- AS OPPOSED TO A ONE SIZE FITS ALL ACROSS THE STATE SO THERE'S THE FIVE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IN THE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WILL BE -- REALLY PUT IN -- THAT WE WOULD THEY WILL TAILOR THE THE FUNDING AND WHICH PROGRAMS GET EMPHASIZED -- TO MEET THEIR LOCAL NEEDS BASED OFF OF WHAT THEIR PARTICULAR WORKFORCE ISSUES ARE. AND TO THE RECENT ELECTABILITY BUILT INTO THIS THAT -- AND IS OPEN. TO CONTINUOUSLY RE EVALUATING ANNUALLY SO WE OBVIOUSLY WANT ME TO THINK OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY GOALS ARE HOW THAT MEETS DEPENDING ON THE READ REGION'S AND AND WHICH WERE PUTTING THE MONEY INTO SO WHICH PARTICULAR STRATEGIES ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON TYLER IN THE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- WE SUPPORT THIS INVESTMENT IN STATEWIDE ON MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES IN THE NEW -- BUT FIVE YEAR PLAN ON COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS -- AGREE THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL MOMENT TO STRENGTHEN OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORK FORCE COUNTIES ARE BOTH PROVIDERS AND ADMINISTRATORS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THE ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED WORKERS IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. COUNTIES ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO BUILD HIGH QUALITY PROVIDER NETWORKS TO MEET THE NEW WE IMPLEMENTED NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS UNDER THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE FINAL RULE. AND WE WELCOME TOOLS LIKE THIS STATEWIDE -- WET PLAN THAT CAN HELP US ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WE WOULD AGREE WITH THE LA -- IN THE CHAIRED TO TARGET -- WET ACTIVITIES TO THE AREA OF GREATEST NEED WE BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF WET -- REGIONAL COLLABORATED COOPERATIVES PROVIDED BY PROPOSED BY OFSHE BED CAN BE ONE EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR DOING THIS WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO YOU -- RIGOROUS EVALUATION OF THESE FUTURE WET ACTIVITIES TO HELP ASSESS THE IMPACT OF WHAT PROGRAMS AND CONTINUOUSLY REFINE OUR WORK FOR STRATEGIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M FAIR IMITATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE ARE SO BROADLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL -- I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM CBS SHE A AND ALSO SAY THAT -- WITH THE NETWORK ADEQUACY GOALS WE ARE FINDING THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WORKS FORCE -- WE HAVE COMPETING INSTITUTIONS AND SYSTEMS WHO ARE TRYING DAHLE HIGHER THE SAME PEOPLE AND SO WHATEVER I CAN DO -- TO ASSIST IN THIS WE THINK IT'S A WELL CRAFTED PLAN BUT AGREE THAT THERE COULD BE MORE TARGETING AND AS WELL AS EVALUATION IN THE LONG RUN. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK WELCOME. SO MY AND HER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THIS ALLOCATION FOR THE WET. PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. KELLY BROOKS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS AND ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAVE THE LOWEST PROVIDER TO POPULATION RATIOS IN THE STATE FOR ALMOST EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER -- WE WOULD REALLY URGE YOU TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FUNDING THIS YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY SEEN ON THE COMMENTS WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OKAY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO THE FARM HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THANK WITH SEVERAL UPDATES HERE. SOON BRINGING PEOPLE UP SO. FIRST OF EVERYONE INTRODUCE THEMSELVES FOR THE RECORD AND THEN -- WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS THE MEDIC HOW LOCAL ASSISTANT ESTIMATES SO. OR GO AND START WITH PRIMERICA SERVICES -- MERRY COUNTY DEPUTY FROM ABOUT HER SERVICE AVAIL AND JOHNSON LEO. PRIME WILL THE LA A SCIENCE. WELCOME AND A GUEST FINANCE. GLORIA FINANCE OKAY THANK YOU WELCOME SALAS MEDICAL LOCAL ASSISTANT ESTIMATE MAY REVISION UPDATE FOR SO -- FOR NINETEEN TWENTY THEM A REVISION INCLUDES A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND SIX BILLION -- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- A LITTLE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION OF THAT IS STATE OPERATIONS. THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWO BILLION TWENTY THREE MILLION OF WHICH IS GENERAL FUND -- IT'S A SLIGHT INCREASE FROM JANUARY OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND. WE ALSO HAVE -- REQUESTS FOR EIGHTEEN PERMANENT NEW POSITIONS IN THE CONVERSION OF THIRTEEN EXISTING LIMITED TERM RESOURCES TO PERMANENT. AND THEN JUST TO MENTION CASELOAD HAS CONTINUED TO HAVE A SLIGHT DECREASE SO WE ARE NOW JUST -- SLIGHTLY OVER THIRTEEN MILLION SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN IT WAS IN JANUARY -- ALL THE MAJOR CHANGES WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT LATER TODAY SO I WON'T LIST THOSE. THE ONE ADDITIONAL ITEM ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT PART OF THE BUDGET. ITSELF AT THIS TIME GIVEN THE IMPLEMENTATION TIME FRAME WE DID ALSO RELEASE ARE. FISCAL ESTIMATE FOR THE CARVE OUT OF THE PHARMACY SERVICES BACK TO FEE FOR SERVICE -- IT IS ESTIMATED AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION TO BE THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS -- I WILL NOTE THAT WE DID NOT ASSUME ANY SAVINGS RELATED TO THREE FORTY B.. IN THIS ESTIMATE JUST SO THAT IT'S CLEAN AND CLEAR AND I KNOW THERE HAD BEEN CONCERN PREVIOUSLY. THAT MOST THE SAVINGS WOULD BE COMING FROM THREE FORTY B. SO ESSENTIALLY AS A PART OF THIS ESTIMATE -- WE JUST AT THIS POINT ASSUMES. THE PAYMENTS WOULD STAY THE SAME OBVIOUSLY TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE THE FUNDING STILL FLOW THAT WAY THE LEGISLATURE. AND ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP SOME TYPE OF PLAN TO HAVE THE MONEY STAY WITH THEM -- IF OTHERWISE OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE SAVINGS FROM THREE FORTY B. AND THEN THE NUMBER WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN -- THREE NINETY THREE YOU HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE INCREASE IN THE SAVINGS -- FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS REALLY RELATED TO FOR ISSUES -- THERE WE'VE DELAYED REPAYING -- SOME TITLE -- TWENTY ONE FUNDS THAT WE A CLAIMS BEFORE AS WERE STILL WORKING WITH CMS. ON THEN EXCHANGING THAT FOR TITLE. NINETEEN WE DID HAVE INCREASED DRUG REBATES -- WE HAD FEWER DEFERRALS FROM CMS AND THEN WE DID HAVE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE TIMING OF RETROACTIVE MANAGED CARE RATE ADJUSTMENTS OKAY HELLO [inaudible] IT'S MILLION. RYAN WAS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS WE HAVE BEEN -- CAREFULLY LOOKING THROUGH AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION MEDI CAL ESTIMATE. AND DON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME -- HOWEVER WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE ESTIMATED SPENDING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS NOW ABOUT THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS LOWER. THAN AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR -- WHEN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT WAS APPROVED -- AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW -- VERY LARGE ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL BUDGET HAVE BECOME RELATIVELY COMMON -- IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAM -- AND THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO FORMULATE AND PURSUE LONGER TERM FISCAL PLANS IN ALIGNMENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES. AND ALSO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM -- WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE SOME OF OUR COMMENTS FROM EARLIER IN THE YEAR ON A PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD AND CONTINUES TO PROPOSE. THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING -- AND POSITIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BETTER TRACK -- CASH FLOWS AND AND ESTIMATES IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. AND ALSO TO CREATE A SPECIAL FUND THAT WOULD SMOOTH THE IMPACT OF DRUG REBATES. ON ON THE MEDI CAL BUDGET THE MAYOR VISION CONTINUES THAT AS WELL -- AND PROPOSES TO PUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS INTO THAT SPECIAL FUND -- WE CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. THOSE PROPOSALS AND KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE TOOK ACTION TO APPROVE THE CREATION OF THE SPECIAL FUND -- BUT WE FURTHER RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO SHARE KEY INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD BE GAINED FROM -- THESE NEW POSITIONS THAT ARE GONNA BE TRACKING -- MEDI CAL EXPENDITURES FOR EXAMPLE PERHAPS ADDITIONAL MADE YOUR UPDATES ON THE CASH FLOWS OF CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM THAT ARE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCERTAINTY. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A LONGER TERM PLAN WITH. MORE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT WOULD -- IMPROVE THE ESTIMATES OF THE MEDI CAL BUDGET IN AN INCREASE THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO OVERSEE THE PROGRAM. AND WOULD SUGGEST THAT PROCESS BE CREATED THAT WOULD -- GATHER INPUT FROM THE LA -- AND FROM OTHER LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND TO GENERATE IDEAS FOR HOW -- THAT PLAN COULD BE ASSEMBLED -- WITH WE THINK THIS WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE -- TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE PREDICTABILITY -- IN THE FUTURE AS AS SOME OF THESE COMPLEXITIES ARE ARE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU FINANCE. A QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER STONE THANK YOU SO -- THE AMOUNT OF A DRUG REBATES. FOR THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT RIGHT. I'M SORRY I'M NOT CLEAR WHAT THE QUESTION ARM ACIDIC REBATES SO WHAT WHAT'S OUR TOTAL GENERAL SAVINGS -- I DON'T KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP MEDICINE TO CLUE IT'S SOMETHING LOOKS TO BE A LOT HIGHER THAN THAT. YEAH. THREE TO FOUR THREE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. OKAY. ASSIST THIS HUGE SO. AS A PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR X. BUYING IS THAT. HAVE YOU BEEN GIVEN ANY DETAILS ABOUT HOW THAT CAN ENHANCE -- YOUR PROGRAM AND ENHANCE OF MONEY COMING BACK INTO THE STATE THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OUR ADMINISTRATION COLLEAGUES ON THE REPORTS THAT WE HAVE TO DO -- TO THE GOVERNOR AND SO THAT THOSE ARE STILL GOING UNDER WAY IN FACT THE DIRECTOR WAS HAVING A MEETING TODAY. HE'S NOT HERE -- SO IT'S FORTHCOMING BUT WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THOSE OKAY. WE'RE HOPING THAT THOSE -- EFFORTS ARE GOING TO BE FRUITFUL -- IN THE COMING YEAR AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR US NEXT YEAR AS WE ENTERED A THIS BUDGETS THANK YOU SO -- ACTUALLY BUT FOR DAILY -- SO BUT I APPRECIATE A YEAR THE THE THE PRESENTATION AND WE HEARD ALSO EARLIER IN THE YEAR. HOW DO WE? DO OVERSIGHT RATE. THAT A COW. IS WE SIT HERE AND WE HAVE ITEMS AS SMALL AS WELL LIKE WITH THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MILLIONS EVEN TENS OF MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. AND WE COME TO YOU MEDI CAL RIGHT AND WE HAVE A SWING OF WHAT TWO THREE BILLION RIGHT NOW THAT'S DOES A PERCENTAGE THAT'S ABOUT. TO ISSUE PERCENTRATE GIVEN THE HOUSE THAT DAY IT IS -- AND THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE CHALLENGING RIGHT BECAUSE I MEAN WE CAN FIND A LOT OF STUFF FOR TWO BILLION OF ITS THERE AND THAT THE TWO BILLION -- WE SPENT TWO BILLION MORE WE THOUGHT. THAT A LOT LESS MONEY THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT OF MAKE UP -- BUT I GUESS -- FOR WHAT'S THE SWING IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL FUND. THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT THE WHOLE BUDGET BECAUSE WE HAVE A FEDERAL MATCH AND ENDS AND EVERY LIGHTS Là MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT BUT IN TERMS OF OUR BUDGET MANAGEMENT. HOW MUCH OF A SWING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GENERAL FUND WISE? SO THE THREE POINT THREE BILLION NUMBER THAT I MENTIONED THAT IS GENERAL FUND OKAY AND IT IS IT'S ABOUT 14%. OF OF THE MASS THAT IS A PARTICULARLY LARGE. ADJUSTMENT AND IMPRACTICAL TERMS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME. WE WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT AN INCREASE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OVER THE PRIOR ESTIMATE AND THAT THEN HAD TO FACTOR INTO THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION MAKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT. WHAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO ALLOCATE TO VARIOUS PRIORITIES YEAH AND THEN IN JANUARY AND THEN UPDATING HERE IN MAY IT'S NOW SWUNG THE OTHER DIRECTION -- BY A VERY LARGE AMOUNT. AND I'M SURE THE ISSUE BECOMES EVEN MORE MAGNIFIED IN YEARS WHERE WE HAVE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES WERE CASE LET'S GO UP AND SO FORTH AS WELL IS THAT TRUE. THAT THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE A TRUE BUT A LOT OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE'RE SEEING HAVE MORE TO DO WITH -- THE TIMING OF PAIN KAY. RIGHT OKAY AND THE WAY WE DO THE ACCOUNTING FOR THAT RIGHT IS IT WE DO CASH RATE SO. SO DEL DEPENDS ON WHAT TIME WE HAVE TO PAY THE BILL IT'S AT DOES A FALL BEFORE OR AFTER. OKAY YES AND THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF SAY LIMITING GENERAL FUND GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM OVERALL BY ONE RELYING A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND ALSO RELYING ON A LOT OF THAT NON GENERAL FUND STATE REVENUES. THE TOLL THE GENERAL FUND CAN BE AT RISK FOR THE CHANGES IN THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM IN WHICH WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR A ANY FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S NOT COMING IN OR THE TIMING OF THESE. OTHER NON FEDERAL FUNDS AND SO TO SOME DEGREE THE RISK IS LARGER THAN JUST THE GENERAL FUND PROPORTION OF THE BUDGET THAT YOU SEE. AND SO I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT ESPECIALLY THE DRUG REBATE BECAUSE OF THAT I REMEMBER ONE YEAR WAS A HOSTILE ONE A HALF BILLION OR SOMETHING SWINGING AND DOES A MISCALCULATION THERE IS ANOTHER FEW BILLION LIKE YOU KNOW. LIKE WHICH THROUGH A FEW BILLION HERE FOR THE THEIR RIGHT -- WHICH IS THE THE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATIONS IS THE LA -- PLAN THE BABY PUT TOGETHER A MORE FORMAL REPORT ABOUT THIS THAT WE CAN USE AS A TEMPLATE FOR PURSUING AND UPS THE WE WILL WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS. TO TRY TO HOW HOW IN TERMS OF HOW WE BETTER MANAGE OBVIOUSLY DOES THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES MEDI CAL HOW CAN BETTER MONITOR THIS. AND AND MANAGE THESE. THESE SWINGS IN RISKS. THAT'S SOMETHING WE CERTAINLY COULD CONSIDER I THINK WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN -- WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO OURS FIVE WAYS THAT -- WE COULD GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED AND ALSO WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE WAY THAT WE MAKE OUR PAYMENTS THAT COULD. PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CERTAINTY -- FROM YEAR TO YEAR -- WE POTENTIALLY COULD PUT THOSE THINGS IN HER APARTMENT I THINK. WANTED JUST WORK INFORMALLY AND WITH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THESE ISSUES. A CLEAR TO ME AT THAT IS THAT WE ALL HAVE A MUTUAL INTEREST AND SO WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT POLICY GOALS OF A HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE A MUTUAL INTEREST AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE BETTER MANAGE THE BUDGET AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND SWINGS THAT WE HAVE. AND IN THE BUDGET. YES AND THE THE THE AT THE ONLY THING I THAT IS AT THIS REALLY CAME TO HAVE THE HEAD A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN THERE IS A LARGE SWING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. AND THE DEPARTMENT IS REALLY ENGAGED IN PROACTIVE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ITS OWN PROCESS SEES SOME OF ITS OWN IT SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH. AND SO I THINK AT THIS STAGE IT'S REALLY TIME -- TO START BRINGING THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE AS SORT OF OVERSEE IS OF THE BUDGET INTO THIS PROCESS TO IT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN OVERSIGHT BROADLY. WE DON'T JUST OVERSEE THE BUDGET WE ACTUALLY WRITE THE BUDGET. I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE SO I THAT SO I THINK -- YEAH SO WE WE SHOULD. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL THESE ISSUES HERE RIGHT NOW BUT I APPRECIATE THOSE PRESENTATIONS AND WE SHOULD BE. REALLY LOOKING AT AT SOME INITIAL STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND AND FED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THOSE BUT IT'S I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE NOT JUST CONVERSATION BUT THINK ABOUT ACTIONS WE WANT TO TAKE -- SO JUST TO BE CLEAR -- SO A AND THAT YOU'D MENTIONED AND AND I HAVEN'T SEEN BY UNDERSTAND MY STAFF AS THE FINANCIAL REPORT ON THE BULK PURCHASING. SO THE CARVE OUT SO -- SO WHEN. HE SAID THERE'S NO SAVING SEVENTY FORTY BE IN THE ACCIDENT AND AND AND THE ESTIMATES SO WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THREE FORTY BE THEN. RIGHT SO I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S NO SPECIFIC PROPOSAL ON HOW TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE IT NATURALLY AS A POLICY -- IF THE CAR ABOUT HAPPENED AND NOTHING NOTHING PROACTIVE WAS DONE BY THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION THERE WOULD THEN BE SAVINGS IN A THREE FORTY BE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE BEING PAID AT COST. WHICH THEY ARE NOT IN MANAGED CARE SO WE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE FEE FOR SERVICE POLICY BUT WE DIDN'T WANT SORT OF THE CONVERSATION TO GET CONFUSED ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE SAVINGS WAS FROM THAT VERSES ACTUAL SORT OF INCREASES IN REBATES AND OTHER. OTHER TYPES OF SAVINGS AND SO -- AS WE SAID BEFORE WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT WHAT ARE THOSE DOLLARS IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE FOR US TO ESTIMATED BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THREE FORTY PRICES ARE. ONLY THE COVERED ENTITIES DO SO. IT FELT. FUNNY TO JUST GAS WHAT IT WOULD BE AND SAID YOU KNOW I KNOW WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR SEASON AT COLLEAGUES THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING SOME WORK IN ESTIMATING ON WHAT IT WOULD BE. AND I THINK AGAIN WE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT ARE SOME OPTIONS -- IF IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION WANT TO CONTINUE HAVE THAT MONEY FLOW TO THEM OKAY AND THEN THE THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION YOU MENTIONED SO WHERE IS THAT COMING FROM. SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY ADDITIONAL REBATES AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE ALLOWABLE INGREDIENT COST -- BOTH IN FEE FOR SERVICE AND MANAGED CARE -- WE DO I THINKS SCOTT PROBABLY DOES HAVE THE WORKSHEET THAT LAYS OUT THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OF THE FISCAL [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. YES SIR SOUND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TOOK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- YOU KNOW BACK DURING THE RECESSION WE WE DELETED A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT SERVICES. FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS INCLUDING AUDIOLOGY SPEECH THERAPY. AND THE ONE THAT REALLY RESONATES WITH ME IS -- PODIATRY -- PODIATRISTS OFTEN -- THROUGH THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEET CAN. OFTEN -- DIAGNOSE CIRCULATORY PROBLEMS THAT EXIST WITHIN DIABETIC POPULATION. AND CAN ARE HELPFUL IN IN SCREENING THESE. THESE PATIENTS THAT ARE AT RISK OF AMPUTATIONS -- IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT -- FIVE OUT OF A THOUSAND DIABETICS. ARE. GETTING LIMBS AMPUTATED AND WE HAVE I HAVE THIS STUDY DONE BY. THE KAISER -- HEALTH NEWS -- QUOTING A PROFESSOR AT THE KECK SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THE U. S. C. IT'S IT'S AN EPIDEMIC WITHIN AN EPIDEMIC AND IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S TOTALLY IGNORED. IN CALIFORNIA WHERE DOCTORS PERFORMED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND DIABETIC AMPUTATIONS FROM SEVENTEEN AND PEOPLE THAT WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO ONE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY. THAN NON HISPANIC WHITES TO UNDERGO AMPUTATION RELATED TO DIABETES [inaudible] SO. THE HOUSE WITH MY COLLEAGUES MY STEAM FROM NOW DOCTOR PANEL TELL YOU -- THE COST OF LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S FEET TEN RESTORING THIS BENEFIT. IS PROBABLY MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT COSTS. THE AND TO PUT A PATIENT THROUGH AN AMPUTATION THAT CAN HAVE CERTAIN RAMIFICATIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO TO WORK AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES WHICH PROVIDES ANOTHER -- PROBLEM FOR A SOCIAL SERVICE NETWORK -- WHY -- HAVE THESE SERVICES NOT BEEN -- RESUME TO IF YOU WILL -- BEING THAT WE HAVE A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS IN THE FOR CUT. DURING -- VERY CHALLENGING TIMES. ESPECIALLY WHEN A UP A BUCK INVESTED MIGHT SAVE FIVE OR TEN DOLLARS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY -- PREVENT THEM THE MORBIDITY AND POTENTIAL MORTALITY OF OF DIABETICS THAT HAVE TO COPE WITH UNCONTROLLED DIABETES. GLORIA LET DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD AGREE THAT THERE ARE MANY -- SERVICES INVESTMENTS THAT COULD FURTHER BE MADE IN THE BUDGET BUT THERE'RE STILL A LIMITED NUMBER OF AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND THEIR MANY INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THIS IS I'M NOT ONE OF THEM BUT WERE HAPPY. TO WHERE WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN YOUR PRIORITIES. OKAY -- WELL. AND THESE WERE SERVICES THAT WERE CUT DURING SOME VERY CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES WHEN I WAS TAUGHT IN THE LEGISLATURE -- WE HAD MORE CASH FLOWING INTO THE COUNTY TREASURY THAN WE'VE EVER WITNESSED IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. AND WE HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANICS THAT ARE SEEING AMPUTATIONS OTHERWISE COULD HAVE BEEN SPARED HAVE THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE -- PARTY AFTER CAKES EMANATIONS OF THEIR FEET -- DO WE KNOW -- LA -- SIX OF THE BUDGET -- IF WE WERE. TO BEGIN TO FUND THIS AGAIN OR WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE IF YOU HAVE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. YES AND THE ANNUAL ESTIMATE IS APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FIFTY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS FOR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND OKAY. SO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- WE OFTEN HEARD THE TERM BUDGET DUST THAT'S REALLY BUDGET DUST. BUT THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS COULD MULTIPLY EXPONENTIALLY IF WE HAVE TO PROVIDE AMPUTATIONS. NOT TO MENTION THE THE THE TRAUMA THAT ONE WOULD HAVE TO THE DOOR KNOWING THAT THERE ARE MORE THEIR LEGS. OR FEET HAVE TO BE AMPUTATED -- I JUST BRING THIS UP FOR YOUR RECONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BUDGET THIS TO ME AS A AN ISSUE WHERE -- INVESTMENT IN THE DOLLAR CAN SPEAK COULD SAVE A HECK OF A LOT MORE IN THE FUTURE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE THING ELSE YES FINANCE. WELL OPEN MONDAY BECAUSE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SENATOR SOME BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ON DRUG REBATE IMPACT -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND SAVINGS OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION -- IN GENERAL FUND. OKAY -- IS YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT THIS ITEM. OKAY CAM THE ROCKS ON BEHALF OF KELLY BROOKS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS -- I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION YOU ALL JUST HAD -- AROUND HOW THE THREE FORTY BE SAVINGS ARE IMPACTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL ON THE PHARMACY BENEFIT -- I APPRECIATE MISS CAN'T ALL COMMENTS WE HAD NOT HEARD PREVIOUS TO THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS SAVINGS NUMBER DID NOT INCLUDE THREE FORTY B. AND WE'RE VERY OPEN TO CONTINUING TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD -- TO ADDRESS THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONCERNS ABOUT TRYING TO SAVE MONEY ON PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING BUT ALSO NOT ADVERSELY IMPACTING SAFETY NET PROVIDERS -- AND I THINK THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION PROBABLY CONCURS WITH THE REMARKS I JUST MADE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME ARE THE GIRL RIBS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND VERY SUPPORTIVE AND THINK OF FOR THE ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN POINT THREE MILLION A MEDICAL COUNTY ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. ANOTHER COMMON SO WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPENED AND LET'S MOVE ON TO THE FAMILY HEALTH ESTIMATES MAY REVISION UPDATE TOUR SO WE'VE HAD A PRETTY EASY -- IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND EXPENDITURES IN CASELOAD -- BOTH CCS NGH PP HAD A KEY SLOW DECLINE REALLY DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF AN ACTIVE CASES WE DID HAVE A INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES NGH PP -- AND THAT WAS REALLY RELATED TO A BACKLOG OF CASES WHERE THEY'VE NOW BEEN APPROVED IN CLAIMS HAVE BEEN PAID. WE ALSO DO YOU SEE -- AN INCREASE IN OUR EVERYWOMAN COUNTS -- EXPENSES AND THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE OF A SHIFT FROM A CONVENTIONAL MAMMOGRAPHY TO DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE. AND AS WELL WE'VE HAD SOME. CORRECTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING SO. FAIRLY MINIMAL BUT THOSE THOSE OF THE MAJOR ITEMS. ELIO WE HAVE REVIEWED THIS BUDGET AND DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. A FINANCE. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE'RE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FAMILY OF A SMITH. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL RIGHT TO A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. OKAY. RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE THE UPDATE I THINK AGENTS AGAIN I AND WE HAD A PRESENTATION ON CCS AND CERTAINLY G. H. P. P. IS A PART OF IT. WE WANT TO BE SURE -- OUR PATIENTS WHO HAVE RARE CONDITIONS -- THEY DON'T REALLY FIT WELL IN THEM AND THE OTHERS CURRENT MANAGED CARE PAIRED I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T DO MANAGED CARE BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE REGIONAL SYSTEMS OF CARE CELL. TRYING TO FIT THEM INTO A MANAGED CARE PLAN THAT IS NOT. THAT DOESN'T DEVELOPMENT DID THEY HAVE TO HAVE OF WIDER NETWORK THAN WHAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF THESE PATIENTS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT -- THESE PROGRAMS -- AND WE CERTAINLY HAD AN UPDATE ON THE OF THE HOTEL IS DOWN MILES ON THE HOTEL MODEL IN CCS SO WHERE -- WE WANNA KEEP. CLOSE LED A CLOSE CLOSE EYE ON THAT -- CG PEAS TWENTY TWO PEOPLE NOW. OKAY. RIGHT SO OKAY.

SURE SO ALL OF THE TO DO THE THE PRESENTATION AND ADDRESS THE FINAL QUESTION AND THEN WILL DEFER TO MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER. COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SO THE MAY REVISION CONTINUESTHE PROPOSALS THAT WE HAD IN JANUARY WHICH REALLY IS CONTINUING -- THE EXISTING DOLLARS -- THAT HAVE BEEN FLOWING IN THIS YEAR -- INTO THE BUDGET YEAR WE ALSO DO YOU HAVE FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED AS A RESULT OF SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WITH THAT THAT WE HAVE THAT'S ONE TIME IN NATURE -- AND SO THOSE. THOSE FUNDING -- TO SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL MONEY INTO THE VALUE BASED PAYMNT PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION -- I WILL I JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU HAD ABOUT THAT NOW -- WE ARE STILL FINALIZING THE THE METRICS AND HOW WE WANT TO USE THIS MONEY -- THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT. ISSUE FOR THE SECRETARY AND SO WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH HIM ON HOW DOES HE BETTER THINK WE CAN -- FOCUSES MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE REALLY HAVING INTEGRATION AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET SORT OF A FULL SCOPE OF CARE -- IN THE SAME LOCATION -- IN ADDITION TO THE SEVENTY MILLION THERE IS SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING SPREAD OVER THREE YEARS -- TO FUNDS PROVIDER TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE TRAUMA SCREENINGS -- I BELIEVE THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A PROVIDERS PROPERLY TRAINED -- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE THEN CONTRACT THAT SO THAT -- THE MONEY THEN ONLY FLOWS FOR A PROVIDER WHO'S TAKEN AN APPROPRIATE TRAINING SO WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL AND LOOKING AT CONTRACTORS TO WORK WITH US TO DEVELOP BUT A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING AS WELL AS OUR REACH -- AND MATERIALS FOR THE ENTIRE OFFICE NOT JUST THE PROVIDER AND AS WELL AS FAMILY SO THEY UNDERSTAND -- WHY THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED -- IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEING ADDED TO OUR LOAN REPAYMENT CALLED CAL HEALTH CARE'S. A HUNDRED MILLION FOR PHYSICIANS AND TWENTY MILLION FOR DENTISTS WE DID. HAVE THE FIRST APPLICATION PERIOD CLOTHES -- I THINK LAST WEEK NOW -- WE HAD TWELVE HUNT OVER TWELVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FOR THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM -- THE TOTAL AMOUNT REQUESTED WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION. SO WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR EVERYTHING BUT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THOSE APPLICATIONS IN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUNDING FOR THAT -- BY THE END OF JUNE SO THAT THAT MONEY CAN START TO FLOW. AND THEN FINALLY -- THE FOURTH ITEM. FUNDED DIDN'T FOURTH NEW ITEM FUNDED IS THE RESTORATION OF THE OPTICAL BENEFIT FOR ADULTS WORDS THE PROVISION OF GLASSES IN. AND ISN'T SO THAT NOT. DEFERRED MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE COLLEAGUES FOR THE OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ADDRESS BECAUSE THANK US DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE WANT TO BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING US UNDERSTANDS HUNDRED PAN YOUR BANK CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED EARLIER IN THE HEARING REGARDING THE SUNSETS. FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS SO WE WULD LIKE TO TAKE NOTICE COMMENTS AND LET YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL BE TAKING THOSE BACK FOR CONSIDERATION. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I BELIEVE IN THE AGENDA THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. IS THE AT FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER PAYMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE PURSUING. A ONE YEAR STATE PLAN AMENDMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT AN ANNUAL -- YEAR BY YEAR I SUB MIDDLE OF ANNUAL STATE PLAN AMENDMENTS ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION'S CIVIL FLEXIBILITY -- AS YOU REVENUES FOR THE THIS PROGRAM COMMENT ON ANNUAL BASIS WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ON FUNDING LEVELS SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THE US AND ABOUT EIGHTY LA -- COMMENTS SEVEN PRESENTED AT THAT WOULD. EXCUSE EXCUSE ME -- BEEN JUMPING IN WITH ELIO -- WE WE WROTE IN OUR ANALYSIS THAT WHILE WE FIND MAKING MOST OF THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PAYMENT INCEASES -- LIMITED TERM HAS POLICY MERITS TO ALLOW THEM TO BE -- EVALUATED BEFORE THEY WOULD BE MADE PERMANENT WE DO RAISE CONCERNS -- ABOUT SUN SETTING THEM FOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT REASONS AS WE FIND THAT ULTIMATELY IT IT UNDERSTATES THE TRUE ONGOING COSTS OF POLICY COMMITMENTS -- IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WHAT WERE THESE -- WAS IT WERE AN ANALYSIS TO TAKE PLACE FOR EXAMPLE FINDING THESE -- THESE PAYMENTS TO BE EFFECTIVE -- THE THE CURRENT PLAN WOULD STILL BE TO TURN THEM OFF AT MIDWAY THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO -- WE WE HAVE THOSE CONCERNS WITH THE SUNSET AS WELL -- WE ALSO PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROPOSAL AND OVERLAP WITH OTHER EFFORTS TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE IN MANAGED CARE BUT WE TOUCHED ON THOSE DURING A PREVIOUS HEARING HAPPY BUT I'LL BE I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES -- CONSIDERATION OF THE THE SUNSET -- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE MOST. IMPORTANT QUALITIES OF ELECTED OFFICIAL IS WHEN. THEY GIVE THEIR WORD AND THEY SAY SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR WORD -- THIS GOVERNOR IN JANUARY MADE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT PROP FIFTY SIX PROCEEDS WERE GOING TO GO AS THEY WERE INTENDED TO GO AND THAT WAS TO SUPPLANT -- ARM OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM -- IT. WE WITNESSED IN THE PAST WITH THE PRIOR GOVERNOR THAT PROP FIFTY SIX MONIES DIDN'T GO TO WHERE THEY WERE INTENDED AND ACTUALLY WENT INTO THE GENERAL FUND. FOR NON MEDICARE ALL NON HEALTH CARE RELATED ISSUES. SO. JUST BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE SUNSET RAISES A LOT OF SUSPICIONS -- AS TO WHY WE WOULD EVEN CONSIDER. THE NEWS FUND SOMEPLACE ELSE WHETHER BE THE GENERAL FUND OR ELSEWHERE. ESPECIALLY AFTER THE GOVERNOR MADE A COMMITMENT. A PUBLIC COMMITMENT -- AND THAT HE RECEIVED A LOT OF PRAISE. FOR THAT A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED FOR SO MANY YEARS WAS FINANCING SOME RELIEF. SO WHILE I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS -- I'M I'M AS ONE AND I THINK MY CAUCUS AS ANOTHER IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET. DOCUMENT AS A WHOLE. AND I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR MAINTAIN HIS WORD AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO WE CAN. WITH -- THE TAXES OF PEOPLE RELIED UPON TO ENSURE THAT THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IS IS IS WELL FUNDED AS WE POSSIBLY CAN MAKE. THANK YOU [inaudible] OTHER COMMENTS. SO YEAH I I'LL I WOULD -- ALSO JUST HAVE SAID REGARDING THE SUNSET -- THE VOTERS SO ASIDE FROM THE GENERAL MARKET MADE ABOUT SUNSETS ON PREVIOUS ITEMS I ALSO MENTIONED THAT. FOR IT'S A GOOD FOR PROP FIFTY SIX THE VOTERS VOTED FOR THIS. TAX IS REVENUE STREAM RIGHT. AND WITH THAT AND IN GETTING THE VOTERS THE VOTERS VOTED FOR THIS TO GO TO SPECIFICALLY -- IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICAL INCLUDES -- INCLUDING IMPROVING -- PAYMENTS BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT WAS A IT DOESN'T ISSUES I MEAN THAT DOUBLE THE CENTER I WAS PART OF THAT CAMPAIGN IS THE CENTERPIECE OF THE CAMPAIGN. AND SO I THINK THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD PUT A SUNSET I MEAN THE VOTERS ENOUGH VOTE FOR A SUNSET ON THE THE PROPOSITION. THE IT'S AN ONGOING PROPOSITION AND I THINK YOU KNOW -- TO HONOR WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED -- FOR THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD THEN PUT A SUNSET ON ON THOSE THINGS THANK IS IS EXTREMELY DISTURBING -- WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION WHEN IT FIRST PASSED AND PROPOSALS ABOUT HOW TO DIRECT THE MONEY -- I APPRECIATE THAT THIS GOVERNOR HAS MADE STATEMENTS THAT HE WANTS HONOR WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED FOR FOR PROP -- FIFTY SIX AND IT'S IN THEM WE APPRECIATE HIS. HIS EXPRESSIONS OF THAT AND I I THINK THAT AND SO PUTTING A SUNSET BASICALLY IMPLYING THAT AT THAT SUNSET DATE IS THE THE MONEY WOULD THEN REFER TO THE GENERAL FUND. AGAIN UNDERMINES THE TRUST OF THE VOTERS -- AND SO OF THOSE WE GO TRY IT YOU'LL BUILD TRUST WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT DO WE KEEP OUR PROMISES. WHEN VOTERS VOTE FOR THINGS DO WE CARRY OUT WHAT THEY DECIDE WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS ARE I MEAN WE CAN? PUT UP MIL WE CAN TRY TO BE LEGALISTIC BUT DURING THE TENSIONS ARE PROVIDE CLEAR. AND SO I THINK THIS REALLY SENDS THE WRONG SIGNAL TO THE VOTERS ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE TRUSTWORTHY -- AT THAT WE RESPECT WHAT THEY'VE TOLD US -- AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT OF COURSE IT ALSO HAS POLICY IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE AGAIN THAT. THIS IS A BIT OF REPETITION THE PREVIOUS. ONES BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU'RE TELLING OTHER PEOPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE YOU DON'T HIRE PEOPLE WITH THE INTENTION OF LAYING THE MáS IN TWO YEARS. RIGHT HI YOU DON'T TELL PEOPLE THAT WELL WILL -- WE'RE GONNA BRING YOU ON BOARD BUT THEN WE WON'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO I MEAN THAT THAT'S RIGHT OR WE'RE GOING TO CUT YOUR SALARY IN TWO YEARS I GUESS YOU COULD BECAUSE HE REALLY UP FRONT ABOUT IT BUT THEN YOU CAN THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IS IT TO RECRUIT. PEOPLE FOR THAT. SO -- SO I THINK IT HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ALSO IN THAT REGARD BUT IT FUNDAMENTALLY. THE IDEA THAT THE VOTERS SAID WE ARE PASSING THIS PROPOSITION FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THEN WE HEAR AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT WE ARE GOING TO PROPOSE TO SAY WELL. TOO BAD WE'RE GOING TO GO AND JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND THEN FOR SOMETHING ELSE OR JUST THROWN TO THE GENERAL POT. I THINK RELIEF SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE AND IT AND AS WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS TO TALK ABOUT OTHER PRIORITIES AND WE HAVE O PROVE OURSELVES TRUSTWORTHY OF THAT AND AS A EVERY TIME SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T. IMPLY IN ANY WAY THAT WE ARE NOT FIND INTENTIONS OF THE VOTERS. THAT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WENT AND CAMPAIGN FOR THE PROPOSITION SUCCESSFULLY. AND AND AND SAID THAT THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSITION WE NEED TO RESPECT THAT AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT -- THAT -- WE NOT SEND THAT WE NOT TELL THE VOTERS OTHERWISE SO. SO TO ME THAT AGAIN THE SUNSET SUNSET THE SUN SETS IN GENERAL THE PROBLEM THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC -- THE OTHER ISSUE I ACTUALLY WANT TO ASK ABOUT SO I DO APPRECIATE THE THE PROPOSALS -- IN TERMS OF THE AUGMENTATIONS -- THE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THE OPTICAL WAS SOMETHING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED BEFORE SO I REALLY DO IT -- THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WE'RE DOING THIS PREVIOUSLY I WOULD. COMMENT THAT -- ALSO -- EIGHT MY MY GOOD FRIEND HAS TALKED ABOUT THE DIET TREE IS WELL AND NOT TO THE SAFE IT'S AN FIFTY SIX BUT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE END COST BENEFIT RATIO RIGHT -- THE BUT THERE'S FINANCIAL ARE ALSO IN THE BUT THE OTHER FOR AND AND THE OTHER PIECE I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE I BELIEVE THE LAST TIME WE TALKED -- WITH. THE X. YES WAS STILL WORKING ON THE FAMILY PLANNING PIECE. AND WHERE AND I THINK WE EXPRESS THAT AT LEAST WHAT WAS BEING PROPOSED AND EVEN YOU AND THE DIRECTOR AT SAID THAT'S NOT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO -- AND THERE WAS -- SO WHAT WHERE ARE WE WHERE WHERE'S ADMINISTRATION ON THE FAMILY PLANNING -- FUNDS THOUGH I FULLY OWNED THAT THAT IS ALL MY FAULT THAT I HAVE NOT FINISHED THE PROPOSALS THAT WAS NO ONE ELSE IN WHO ELSE'S FAULT -- I AM HOPEFUL LEASE. NEXT WEEK WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT -- CAME PARENTHOOD HAS PROVIDED -- IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION -- AROUND SOME OF THE SERVICES -- I THINK LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE ARE YOU DE INSERTION AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS ARE GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE DATE IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT I'M I'M PRETTY CLOSE AT THIS POINT. OKAY SO AGAIN -- VISIT WITH THEM WON'T REITERATE WHAT WE SAID THE LAST HEARING ENTIRELY BUT BASICALLY WE WANNA BE SURE THE MONEY IS FOCUSED IN A WAY THAT NEWS THE NEEDLE ON ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING THAT'S WHAT I JUST STANLEY SPREADING IT AROUND. ABSOLUTELY WE TOTALLY AGREE OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NO COMMENT ALL RIGHT PUBLIC COMMENT FORCES PUBLIC COMMENT -- KELLY BE MY BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -- WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE INCREASE INVESTMENTS USING ONE TIME PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING OF TWO AND SIXTY THREE MILLION. INCLUDING PHYSICIAN AND OUT AS LOAN REPAYMENT VALUE BASED PAYMENT FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION AND PROVIDER TREATY. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE OTHER FUNDING -- SUCH AS THE MCO TAX OR OTHER REVENUE STREAMS OTHER THAN ONE TIME FUNDS WOULD BE BEST SUITED TO FIND THE RESTORATION OF THE OPTICAL BENEFIT. AND THE OTHER BENEFITS CUT DURING THE SESSION LIKE THE PODIATRY BENEFIT. PROP FIFTY SIX IS PASSED BY THE VOTERS AS YOU GUYS ALL TALKED ABOUT WAS INTENDED TO INCREASE ACCESS VIA PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS RATHER THAN THE BENEFITS -- COVERED OR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES COVERED BY MEDICARE. FOR THE SAME REASON WE OPPOSE THE USE OF PROPERTY SIX TO FIND GROWTH IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AFTER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SUNSET OF PROP FIFTY SIX INVESTMENTS -- ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE INSTEAD WE REQUEST THE SUBCOMMITTEE TAKE ACTION DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO APPROVE -- PROPERTY SIX AND BENT AT INVESTMENTS I'M UNDER A THREE YEAR STATE PLAN AMENDMENT. AND CREATE MORE CERTAINTY FOR PROVIDERS WHO WANT TO SERVE THE PROGRAM. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL IN THE COMING WEEKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. HI DARIA MCGREW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION -- BUT QUICKLY THIS IS A BOTH A ONE IN THREE COMMENT WE SUPPORT THE LA -- SUGGESTION OF MORE TRANSPARENCY PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE SUSCEPTIBLE. TO UNCERTAINTY FUNDS LIKE THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION EXTRA IN PROP FIFTY SIX IT'S LENS -- LENS LIGHT TO WHY WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY ON THE FUNDING -- IN IN PROP FIFTY SIX BIGGER -- ISSUE WE REALLY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING CONTINUITY NEED FOR CONTINUITY IN -- PROVIDER RESOURCE SAYS. WE ARE SEEING. REAL GAINS IN PROVIDERS AND ROLLING IN PROP IN THE DENTAL PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE WE'RE SEEING THE NUMBERS GO UP. IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS NINE HUNDRED NEW PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN ROLLED -- THIS IS A REAL POSITIVE CHANGE IN THIS PROGRAM. AS MENTIONED THE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM HAD TWELVE HUNDRED APPLICANTS WHO ARE WILLING TO COMMIT FIVE YEARS TO THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. SO CDA DOES NOT SUPPORT SUN SETTING -- THE PROGRAM AFTER TWO YEARS WHEN THERE'S SUCH A WILLINGNESS OF PROVIDERS TO COMMIT TO A LONGER TERM AND NEED THE SAME COMMITMENT FROM. FROM THE STATE. THANKS THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE DO APPRECIATE THE FUNDING TO RESTORE EYE GLASSES AND EYEWEAR -- DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS REGARDING THAT THE CHAIR THE CHAIRS CONCERN REGARDING THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THAT AND KNOW THAT -- IT IS A CONCERN TO TO GIVE A BENEFIT AND THEN TAKE IT AWAY TWO YEARS LATER -- WE ALSO NOTE -- AS CHAIR STATED THAT THE GOAL OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WITH TO INCREASE ACCESS TO MEDICARE I'LL -- WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH PROVIDER RATES INCREASE SERVICES AND OR ELIGIBILITY. BOB AND FINALLY WE DO SUPPORT THE NAY REVISION PROPOSAL TO RELATED TO THE VALUE BASED. PAYMENTS AS WELL AS PROVIDE AIR TRAINING FOR TRAUMA SCREENING THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON RENTAL COMING HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WHEN A LINE MY COMMENT TO BROWN THE INTENT OF PROPERTY SIX WITH -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR VALUE BASED PAYMENTS ALSO FOR THE INVESTMENTS FOR THE TRAUMA SCREENINGS. AND FOR OPTICAL BENEFITS ALTHOUGH WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE OPTICAL BENEFITS -- FOR THE ADDITIONAL -- SERVICES IN OPTICAL LAB SERVICES SHOULD CERTAINLY -- THIS BE SOMETHING THAT WE DO MOVE FORWARD INTO PERPETUITY AND NOT JUST HAVE A ONE TIME INVESTMENT FOR THAT THANK YOU. WELCOME. AFTERNOON ANDREAS SAN MIGUEL FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA -- I JUST WANT TO REALLY THINK THE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR COMMENTS TODAY -- ABOUT INSURING THAT THE ALLOCATION FOR FAMILY PLANNING IS SPENT IN A WAY THAT WILL -- GO TO A VARIETY OF SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY INCREASE ACCESS -- AND SO THAT THIS IS A I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE IT LISTED AGAIN AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT -- HAS BEEN DONE BY EVERYONE IN THE ROOM AND ALSO JUST KIND OF ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS ON WORK FORCE. FOR FOR ANY DISCUSSION OF A SUNSET SEVEN THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AMY BLOOMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES -- AND HAVE A GENERAL COMMENT RELATED TO PROP FIFTY SIX AS IT RELATES TO THE MAY REVISE WE REPRESENT THE HANDFUL OF PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES AND THE STATE THAT SERVE MEDICALLY FRAGILE PATIENTS. THAT ARE -- TECHNOLOGY DEPENDENCE THE WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE CONTINUATION OF PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS THAT THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED -- THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION -- SAVES MEDI CAL 500-100-0500 DOLLARS A DAY I'M TO MOVE THESE I AM VERY FRAGILE PATIENTS FROM NICK USE -- AN ICY USE TO THE PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE SO HOPE THE COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER -- FUNDING PROP FIFTY SIX FOR THEM THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SO I GUESS -- I DO HEAR THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE RESTORATION THE BENEFITS WHETHER THAT REALLY SHOULD FIGHT AND PROPERTY SIX ABRIL ARE NOT -- THINKS IT CAN BE RAISED BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION THE BIGGER QUESTION IS -- REGARDS. TO AND IT'S CERTAINLY BILL I SEE THAT HAPPEN -- IN REGARDS TO THE FINANCE TO TWENTY ONE YEAR. VERSUS. THREE YEARS WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED I MEAN I SO AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT. CERTAINTY AND AND AND AND BEING SURE THAT HELP PEOPLE WERE. IT TAKES TIME FEEL PEOPLE'S SIT BACK AND WATCH AND WE SAW THIS HAPPEN UNFORTUNATELY THE ACA WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT WAS A TEMPORARY BOMB. THREE YEARS -- FOR TO FOR MEDICAID FOR PEDIATRICS TO MEDICARE RATES -- PEOPLE POINT TO IT BEING UNSUCCESSFUL AND BUT I THINK THE REASON WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IS NOT BECAUSE THE RATES WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE THE PROBLEM WAS THAT PEOPLE KNEW WAS ONLY FOR THREE YEARS. THAT MANY TIMES -- FRANKLY EVEN IN THIS STATE THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF I MEAN WE WENT BACK WITH. PEOPLE DON'T PEOPLE INTEREST IN SIGNING UP TO GET YELLED AT UNDER PROMISE THAT THEY'LL GET BACK BILL GET BACK FILLED I DO WANT TO SEE IT RIGHT AWAY. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN WE SAY WELL TIME CERTAIN IT'S EITHER GOING TO END OR THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING ONE YEAR BY YEAR. THAT UNCERTAINTY. IS WHAT DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM FRANKLY FOR THEM TAKING A RISK RIGHT TO TO TO SIGN UP RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE. THERE PLENTY PATIENTS TO TAKE CARE OF THERE PLAY PATIENTS HILDA DIED AND DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO TAKE MEDI CAL PATIENTS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE BUT WE WANT THEM TO IN LA. PEOPLE WANT TO IT -- AND DAY ONE OF IN FACT WE SEE THE LEVEL OF INTEREST IN THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM. PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO UNDERSERVED AREAS THEY WANT TAKE YOUR MEDICARE PATIENTS. RIGHT THEY WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THAT'S PART OF NOT BECAUSE WE GET RICH DOING IT. IT'S BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STAY WITH THE REALLY TO PEOPLE I MEAN I'VE INTERACT WITH MEDICAL STUDENTS PRESENCE ALL TIME AND AND THAT'S IN -- DENNIS'S OF WHAT THEY THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE OR UNDERSERVED A DAY DON'T WANT TO SAY WELL WE DON'T TAKE IN THESE PATIENTS REALLY FIGURE THOSE PATIENTS. SO THE DESIRE IS THERE -- BUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WHEN THERE'S ALWAYS THIS UNCERTAINTY WELL HOW MUCH MAY GET PAID WELL IT SAID IT WAS I HAVE TO KEEP PRACTICE GOING [inaudible] RIGHT. SO WITH SO CAN WE TALK ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE MORE CERTAINTY. I MEAN ASIDE FROM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE THAT THE EXPIRATION DATE THE YES SUNSET BUT I MEAN TERMS OF THE PLAN AMENDMENT I MEAN A A REALIZE THAT YES WE YEAR TO YEAR BUT IS THIS IS WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THE OPPOSITION. TO DOING A LONGER PLAN AMENDMENT. I JUST THINK IT'S DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK AS WE WE NOTED EARLIER IT DOES -- ONE YEAR STATE PLAN AMENDMENT DOES GIVE THE DEPARTMENT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY -- AN INMATE ADMINISTRATION GENERAL ARE FLEXIBILITY FLEXIBILITY TO DO WHAT TO ELIMINATE THE PAYMENTS NO NOT THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WOULD HAVE LIKE CIVILIAN A CD NO NO CERTAINLY AND I'M NOT THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY IT IS A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE -- BEING A TOBACCO TAX ALL TOBACCO TAXES SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FLEXIBILITY TO REEVALUATE FUNDING LEVELS ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS. AN ANNUAL STATE PLAN AMENDMENT DOES A FACILITY THAT PROCESS. SO I GUESS. VAN THAT MAKES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT -- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SENDS A CLEAR SIGNAL AGAIN THE THE SUNSET THE FORTIES THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO THIS DOING THIS AN ON GOING BASIS. RIGHT I MEAN CLEARLY YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE DO BUDGET EVERY YEAR WE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND SO FORTH BUT THAT THE INTENTION AND COMMITMENT IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SUSTAINED EFFORT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE GET PEOPLE. TO GO AND BECOME MORE MEDI CAL PAIENTS IN PLACE LIKE FRESNO SACRAMENTO RIVERSIDE OR OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. SO SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT. THAT THAT HAS. TO BE EXPRESSED YOU HEAR AND SEE THE SUNSET CERTAINLY SENDS THE WRONG SIGNAL AND IT AND AND AND IT'S IF YOU'RE DOING YEAR BY YEAR YOU SAY BECAUSE YOU NEED FLEXIBILITY THAT'S TO BE VERY CLEAR WHAT KIND OF FLEXIBLE YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THE FLEX PLEASE NOT ABOUT. WELL WE'RE PLAYING THE PULL THE RUG FROM UNDER YOU WE WANT TO WE ARE WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THIS AND THE ONLY AT THIS IS A REVENUE STREAM YES IT'S A DECLINING ONE BUT IT'S THE ON THIS ONE IS. SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THAT'S NOT GENERAL FUND REVENUE RIGHT ONE AT THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT NOT TO TAKE PROPERTY SIX IN USE AT THE BACK FILL THE GENERAL FUND. I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED SAY. I REALIZE IT'S TRAVIS SOMEBODY HIGHER UP THE BUT I MEAN BUT I MEAN THAT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT KIND OF COMMUNICATION IF YOU GUYS SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT TRUST US. I MEAN IF WE CAN'T TELLING PEOPLE TRUST US. SOME PEOPLE GO HOME LET'S SEE. YES -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WHAT ABOUT MONDAY GETS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR COMMENTS AND WE'LL TAKE THEM BACK -- I DID WANT TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS EXPRESSED HIS COMMITMENT TO YOU KNOW BROADER -- HEALTH CARE -- DELIVERY SYSTEM CHANGES AND SO ON THIS WILL BE A PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS -- IN THE FUTURE SO JUST WANTED TO A POINT THAT POINT OUT AT THIS TIME WELL. AGAIN I IT WE NEED TO BE SURE ACTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH SO AGAIN THE SUNSET I KNOW HARPING ON THE SUNSET A BIT BUT YOU JUST SENT THE WRONG SIGNAL -- WITH THAT. SELF. BUT I THINK BEYOND EVEN JUST ELIMINATING THE SUNSET I THINK A STRONGER EXPRESSION -- THE WIZARD AS HELPFUL AND ACTUALLY THE THE DEEP BETTER ACTUALLY TO DO A THREE YEAR. PLAN AMENDMENT WOULD SET PLEASE SEND A SIGNAL THAT DEAL WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS SO BUT BUT CERTAINLY. IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE OTHER WAYS YOU SEND THAT SIGNAL SWELLED TO REALLY SELL [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE THAN RIGHT. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR FULL SCOPE MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR KNOCKED MANY YOUNG ADULTS MAY REVISION UPDATE. TORSO -- THE MAY REVISION AND DOES SHIFT IMPLEMENTATION DATE TO ONE THAT'S MORE REALISTIC WHICH IS JANUARY -- INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN AND AND CAL HERE'S IN SIZE AS WELL AS HAVING A CLEAR TRANSITION PLAN AND NOTICING AND ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO. THE MOST OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE FISCAL IS RELATED TO THE SIX MONTH SHIFT IN IMPLEMENTATION DATE. WE DID ALSO UPDATE THE THE ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT NUMBERS BASED ON MORE RECENT DATA AS WELL AS CORRECTING AN ISSUE THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE LA -- IN THE JANUARY ESTIMATE. IF THEY CAN THAT EIGHTY FIVE WITH THE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. MORNING MR CARE AND NUMBER GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. JENNY LIND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE NEIGHBOR VISION A SCENES GENERAL FUND SAVINGS OF FORTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. AND MAKE SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL FOR AB EIGHTY FIVE FIRST NOTING CONCERNS FROM COUNTIES ON THE DECREASE OF FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES. THE MAYOR VISION NO LONGER REFLECTS TO CHANGE THE REDIRECTION AMOUNT OF THE FOR COUNTIES REALIGNMENT REVENUES SECOND THE MAYBE REVISION REFLECTS YOLO COUNTY AT THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM COUNTY. AND LASTLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO WITHHOLD REALIGNMENT REVENUES FROM THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM BOARD. UNTIL THE BOARD'S TOTAL RESERVES REACHED A REASONABLE LEVEL EQUAL TO TWO YEARS OF TOTAL EXPENDITURES. AT THAT POINT THE WARTS REDIRECTION WILL BE REFLECTED AT AND WE HAVE HEARD CONCERNS ON THE REDIRECTION LEVEL AT 75% FOR THE SEEM AS KEYBOARD FROM FROM THE LA -- INSTEAD HOLDERS AND WE'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE WILL BE TAKING THESE CONCERNS BACK FOR CONSIDERATION [inaudible] OKAY AVAIL. ON THE NUMBER OF VICE ESTIMATES FOR THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE AL -- WE THINK A JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TIMELINE IS VERY REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF THE STATE'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE PREVIOUS EXPANSION TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN -- WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND -- REVISED CASELOAD ESTIMATES BUT DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. ON THE AB EIGHTY FIVE ISSUE -- WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE MAY STILL BE SOME SAVINGS IN THE FOR A NON CMS P. COUNTIES THAT WERE MENTIONED. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY REFLECTS A POLICY CHOICE TO ALLOW THOSE SAVINGS TO STAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR LOCAL PRIORITIES INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES. THAT'S A REASONABLE PRIORITY -- BUT ONE OF THE LEGISLATURE OF COURSE CAN CAN WEIGH AGAINST OTHER LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FOR GENERAL FUND RESOURCES -- WE ALSO THINK IT IS REASONABLE I'M AS WE NOTED BEFORE FOR THE STATE TO RE DIRECT. REALIGNMENT REVENUES FROM THE C. M. S. P. PROGRAM GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT RESERVE -- OVER TEN YEARS OF OPERATING EXPENSES -- BUT AS WAS NOTED -- WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT APPEARS THE IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MISTER SINCE PROPOSAL WOULD ADDITIONALLY -- ELIMINATE GROWTH FUNDING TO THE SAME AS P. PROGRAM. INDEFINITELY -- AND AT 75% -- WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN SEEM AS P. PROGRAM NOT RECEIVING. REVENUES EVEN AFTER ITS RESERVES GO DOWN TO A LOWER LEVEL. NOW OF COURSE GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF RESERVES OF THE PROGRAM HAS THIS WOULD ALL TAKE PLACE. YEARS IN THE FUTURE -- BUT WE WOULD KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A NEED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DEFINE. THE PARAMETERS OF ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE SAME IS BE PROGRAM. AT THIS POINT -- INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT. THAT THE REVENUES BE REDIRECTED AND FURTHER DIRECT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION -- COME BACK WITH -- ADDITIONAL -- INFORMATION LATER ON OR ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE THE ON GOING -- ROLE OF THE SAME AS P. PROGRAM GIVEN THAT THEIR CASE LET'S HAVE FALLEN SO SIGNIFICANTLY WITH WITH THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE. OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- ANY OTHER COMES FROM FINANCE OR EIGHT OKAY QUESTIONS COMPANIES COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES SIR TARA. SIR JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ARE FOR THIS PROPOSAL -- ONE OF MY COUNTIES KINGS COUNTY FALLS UNDER THE CMS P.. SO. I JUST WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF OF AN UNDERSTANDING AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THE CASELOADS HAVE FALLEN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THAT COUNTY IN IT YOU KNOW OTHER. COUNTIES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT -- THAT THE WOULD FALL UNDER THIS. AND SO WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT AT THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT SPECIFICALLY TO KINGS COUNTY AND OF COURSE A HUNDRED OF IF YOU HAVE NUMBERS ON THE ON THE CASELOADS. WE WE UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE AG COUNTY LEVEL INFORMATION I DON'T KNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS THAT HANDY -- IN IN GENERAL THE FUNDING FOR THE SAME AS P. PROGRAM IS IS AGGREGATED UP FOR ALL THE COUNTIES THAT PARTICIPATE -- OVERALL CASELOADS IN C. M. S. P. COUNTIES -- FELL I'M ABOUT 99% RELATIVE TO BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO THERE'S A VERY VERY SMALL RESIDUAL POPULATION RELATIVE TO THEY SERVE BEFORE -- AND THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE THE LARGE RESERVES HAVE HAVE BEEN -- AMASSED. SO WHAT ABOUT THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT [inaudible] ARE NOT -- WITH THINGS LIKE THAT THAT PERMISSION YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU KNOW AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THAT TO THAT. POPULATION THAT IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED HERE SO SO UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE CMS P. PROGRAM WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE CASE LAW THAT REMAINS INCLUDING IN KINGS COUNTY GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE OVER TEN YEARS WORTH OF RESERVES -- A LATER QUESTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL NEED TO ADDRESS AT SOME POINT IS WHAT IS THE ONGOING ROLE OF THE PROGRAM PARTICULARLY IF THERE ARE OTHER FUTURE EXPANSIONS OF COVERAGE -- SAY IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT FURTHER REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WHO NEED THE SERVICES AND WHAT THAT APPROPRIATE LEVEL FUNDING FOR CMS P. WOULD BE BUT HAT AGAIN THAT IS A LONGER TERM QUESTION. GIVEN THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RESERVES AVAILABLE TO THE PROGRAM TO CONTINUE THE SERVICES TODAY WHAT ABOUT POSITIONS. THE STATE DOES NOT -- HAVE BUDGET POSITIONS FOR FOR THE SAME SB THAT'S A LOCAL A LOCAL MATTER [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AND? GOOD AFTERNOON THAT MR TURN MEMBERS CAROLING ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES-PROGRAM GOVERNING BOARD HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE MERRY VISION AND ASKING FOR ALTERNATE. A PROPOSAL THAT WAS PUT BEFORE THE DEPRTMENT OF FINANCE AND MARCH WHICH WAS TO OFFER. A REDIRECTION OF TWENTY OF THE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE BOARD RECEIVES AND THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF PROGRAMMING. IN FACT THIS MSP COUNTIES NOTABLY THEY WERE WORKING EXTENSIVELY LAST YEAR TO DEVELOP A UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS HEALTH BENEFIT ALL THE WAY UP TO AGE SIXTY FIVE THAT PROGRAM IS LIVE NOW. AND THERE IS A CLINIC SYSTEM WITH ABOUT A LITTLE LESS THAN FIFTY CLINICS IN THE C. MUST BE COUNTY IS THAT WALL -- PROVIDE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING PRIMARY CARE DISEASE CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT. ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE RUNNING NOW THEY PROVIDED A PROPOSAL TO ADMINISTRATION TO EXPAND A SUBSTANTIALLY THE PROGRAMMING THAT THEY'RE OFFERING INCLUDING COVERING UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE WE WERE HOPING TO SEE THAT THAT PROPOSAL WAS INCLUDED IN THE MERRY VISION WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE RESERVE. A SIZEABLE AND OF CONCERN TO THE ADMINISTRATION PLEASE READ PLEASE NOTE THAT HALF OF THAT RESERVE AS A ONE TIME REPAYMENT FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. A IMPLEMENTATION THE SAME AS P. DID FOR A BIT THE THIRTY FIVE C. MUST BE COUNTY SO THAT IS IT'S NOT LIKE ALL THAT MONEY WAS ACCRUING EACH YEAR WAS. PART OF IT IS A VERY LARGE ONE TIME PAYMENT OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE OFFERING TO HAVE REDIRECTED AWAY THAT THEY COULD SUPPORT. WE COVERED THE EXPANSION TO THE UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING UP TO AGE TWENTY SIX INSIDE THE SAME MUST BE COUNTY SO WE THINK THAT'S A FAIR ALTERNATE PROPOSAL AND WE WOULD URGE YOU. TO PROVIDE SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON RONALD COLMAN HERE WE HAVE A HELP TAXES CALIFORNIA I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S -- EXPANSION PROPOSAL FOR YOUNG ADULTS -- CERTAINLY WE DO HAVE A NEW ONCE POSITION ON HOW IT IS FUNDED -- WE DO APPRECIATE THE CHANGES IN THE MAY REVISE FOR THE FOR COUNTY SPECIFICALLY SACRAMENTO SANTA BARBARA -- STANISLAUS IN PLASTER -- TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND PARTICULARLY FOR SACRAMENTO KEEPING THE MONEY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE ELIGIBILITY -- AVAILABLE FOR UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS WE ARE HOWEVER CONCERNED -- ABOUT THE COMPLETE ZEROING OUT -- AND THE SPEND DOWN OF THE RESERVE OF C. M. S. P. -- WELL WE UNDERSTAND THE RESERVE IS A FOCUS WE DO THINK THAT THERE STILL SHOULD BE SOME MONEY THAT IS REDIRECTED TO SAM S. P. -- BECAUSE THEY CERTAINLY ARE -- INVESTING IN -- THAT GAP IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS CERTAINLY THE PATHWAY TO HEALTH PROGRAM DOES PROVIDE SLOTS FOR UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WE HAVE SEEN PROPOSALS FOR C. M. S. P. WHERE THEY HOPE TO EXPAND TO THEIR PATHWAY TO HELP PROGRAM. TO GET MORE UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THE YEAR AND WE DO THINK THAT SOME MONEY BEING REDIRECTED TO THEM COULD BE HELPFUL IN -- A COMPROMISED -- APPROACH WITH THAT SAID -- WITH YOUNG ADULTS WE DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD INCLUDE SENIORS AS WELL IT'S ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS 2% OF THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR MEDI CAL SOME AYE HSS COSTS -- BUT WE DO THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO PRIORITIZE THAT FOR THIS PARTICULAR YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME.

THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. HI THIS IS I'M CARRIE BROWNSTEIN I'M THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER FOR SAM S. P.. I JUST WANTED -- TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AN UNCERTAIN REVENUE FLOW FOR C. M. S. P.. THAT PUTS YOU MUST BE IN A LITTLE BIT OF A POSITION OF ACTING MORE AS AN ENDOWMENT -- WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT IF IF WE HAVE A SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE IN OUR ONGOING REVENUE IN THE FUTURES ZERO IT'S HARD -- TO EXPAND AND THEN YOU KNOW CUT THINGS OFF AFTER THAT AND WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH THE STATE ON THIS AS WELL BECAUSE WE WE HAVE THIS NEW PATH TO HELP PROGRAM WE KNOW THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND. HEALTH CARE TO THE UNDOCUMENTED BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING THAT AGES. TWENTY ONE TO SIXTY FOUR IN OUR THIRTY FIVE COUNTIES WE LESS AS KAREN LÏNG MENTIONED WE HAVE. OVER OR BY ABOUT FORTY SIX TO FIFTY CLINICS RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOCUSING GO AND THEY GET ROLE ACTUALLY AT THE CLINIC. SO AS FAR AS GETTING CARE THEY GET CARE THAT DAY THAT DAY AND WE WANT TO EXPAND THAT TO AGES SIXTY FIVE PLUS. AND WE ALSO WANT TO EXPAND THE PRIMARY CARE BENEFIT FOR CMS P. MEMBERS SOME OF OUR SEEM AS P. MEMBERS MAY NOT BECOME A SIEMENS REMEMBER YES WE DROPPED VERY LOW. AFTER ACA IMPLEMENTATION THERE ARE LIGIBLES OUT THERE BUT IF THEIR SHARE OF COST IS REALLY HIGH THEY MIGHT NOT GO GET THOSE PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. SO WE'RE LOOKING ALSO AT DOING AN EXPANDED PRIMARY CARE. THANK YOU. YOU ARE MEMBERS COUNTY MUST FOR THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S -- EXPANDING COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED -- INDIVIDUALS. THANK YOU. SO -- SO FIRST OF ALL I KNOW THE SHE TO GOVERNMENT'S LEADERSHIP AND AND PROPOSING COVERED THE ANATOMY OF ADULTS I THINK WE'RE ALSO LOOKING SEE WHAT I CAN DO A LITTLE MORE -- I REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE ADMINISTRATION LISTING IN REGARDS TO THE COUNTY REALIGNMENT FOR THE FOR COUNTIES THAT REPRESENT ONE OF THEM SO I APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL. REGARDING CMS P. AND THE SO -- I YET I GET THE IDEA THAT OKAY. AND FROM THE C. M. S. V. FOLKS THAT WHILE THEY GOT FIRST OF ALL WE GOT ONE KIND OF LARGEST CHUNK OF MONEY BACK FOR THE ACA BUT THEY'RE SITTING ON TEN YEARS. RIGHT THAT'S WHY [inaudible] OKAY -- THE OPERATING RESERVE OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THEIR EXPENDITURES A. COULD BE MORE THAN TEN YEARS OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO. SO I GET THE IDEA YOU'RE SAYING OKAY WELL. AT AND MOST OF THE MONEY COMES FROM WHERE [inaudible] FROM. FROM -- THE REALIGNMENT RAVENOUS RIGHT NOW OKAY SO SO THAT SO THAT THAT IS SO AND SO ONE OF THINGS I HEAR THEM SAYING THAT DATED SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING OUT SOME POINT WE'VE. THE MONEY NEEDS THAT. THE ARTS WE KEEP IT SAID I HEARD SPEND DOWN THE TWO YEARS ROUGHLY. AND DESERVE PLAN THEN FOR THEM. TO TO THEN GET REVENUE AGAIN FOR THAT OR I MEAN I GUESS THAT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT'S COME UP SO BECAUSE OTHERWISE EFFECTIVELY YOU'RE NOT SAYING SPEND UNTIL TWO YEARS I MEAN IT JUST GOES DOWN TO ZERO CORRECT. SO -- AND I REALIZE THAT'S NOT THIS YEAR -- PRIVACY SEVERAL YEARS OUT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE THE THE THE AMOUNTS BUT IS. CAN CAN. AT ONE ALABAMA TO GUESS WHAT IT APARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO -- THE TERRIBLE IS FORTHCOMING ON THIS -- AND SO THE PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW IS AFTER WE DETERMINED THAT THERE'S A YOU KNOW A REASONABLE RESERVE -- WE WILL RIVER OR THE REDIRECTION AMOUNT WILL CHANGE 275% AND SO THAT'S THE POINT THAT THE ALLEY -- RAISED EARLIER THAT -- PERHAPS SAID 75% -- THEN THE THE REVENUE -- MAY STILL. MAY STILL BE ZERO AND SO THAT'S WITH MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED EARLIER THOSE ARE THE COMMENTS THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE BACK IN TERMS OF THE 75% VERSUS MAYBE PERHAPS ANOTHER LEVEL -- BUT THE PROPOSAL AS IT IS TODAY IS -- TO AFTER REASONABLE RESERVE. IS REACHED THEN WE WOULD -- INCREASE EVERY DIRECTION 275% OF THE VOTE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIT SO THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT JUST MENTION IS THAT -- IN A FEW CAN APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND TRYING TO GET MORE UNDOCUMENTED COVERED AND I THINK THERE'S SOME HOPE THAT WE CAN DO EVEN MORE OVER THE YEARS MAYBE WE'RE SO LUCKY WILL EVEN. GET EVERYBODY BEFORE THE THAT RUNS OUT AND AND RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE ON C. MYSTERIES NECESSARILY AND DOCUMENT EITHER SO THE PROGRAMS NOT JUST SERVING A DOCUMENT CORRECT. THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS -- UNDOCUMENTED AND FOLKS THAT JUST DON'T HAVE OTHER COVERAGE RIGHT OKAY SO I MEAN WE'VE DONE COVERAGE EXPANSIONS OF OTHER TYPES TO SELL. SO BUT THE ONE PART I ALSO WANTED SO EVEN IF WE OFFER COVERAGE TO ALL UNDOCUMENTED. THE THING I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP MY AT LEAST CURRENTLY WE HAVE. THERE'S A PUBLIC CHARGE ISSUE. AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE HAVING SOME CHALLENGES WITH SOME FAMILIES WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR SERVICES THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR AND WHILE CERTAINLY ONE CAN ARGUE THAT MIGHT ALSO APPLIED TO SOME OF THE CMS IT. I DO WONDER WHETHER SINCE SOME OFTHOSE ARE REALLY MORE DIRECTLY FRANKLY THAT IT DID DID IT IS THAT THAT IS A SERVER BACK UP TO EVEN IF WE SET SAY WE SAY WE'RE GONNA COVER EVERYBODY IN HERE YOU CAN GET MEDI CAL WILL YOUR DOCUMENT OR NOT. DURING THE PEOPLE AFRAID SIGNED UP JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC CHARGE NOW MAYBE THAT WILL CHANGE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY'LL CHANGE IN A FEW YEARS DEPENDS -- BUT A A DO WHAT IT DEALS THINK ABOUT. THIS IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE A GAP. EVEN IF WE CLOSE THE GAP R. COSTA SUBSTANTIALLY. AT LEAST IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS OUT -- DO WE NEED TO HAVE OF A A AND AND I DESERVE SOME DUPLICATION SERVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BACK UP BECAUSE DURING THE PEOPLE FRAYED SIGN UP ANYWAY JUST BECAUSE THEN WE SEE PEOPLE NOW. NOT WAY SIDE FOR WICKER SEEN PEOPLE NOT MY INSIDE FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND. GOING TO THE SEMIS FEWER DATES GO TO A CLINIC AND SHOW UP -- AND NOT HAVING TO SIGN YOUR NAME ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS MAYBE MORE THEY'RE OPEN MORE OPEN THAT THAT AND WE MAKES ONE THINK ABOUT THAT AS A POLICY THING TO CONSIDER. RIGHT AND IT IS WORKERS ARE MOVING FORWARD AS WELL. AND TELL MAYBE THINGS WILL CHANGE IN FUTURE YEARS AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT AS MUCH BUT RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING PEOPLE TO WORRY ABOUT. SO JUST WHAT THROW THAT IN THIS PART OF THE DISCUSSION OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. BUT AGAIN APPRECIATE -- THE ON GOING CONVERSATION OF THE CHANGES MADE SO FAR BUT I THINK FOR SERIOUSLY I MAY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING -- BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING. THEM AND I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT MOST OF THE MONEY IN ONE YOU KNOW THE ACA BUT IT. SELL. ALTHOUGH THE ONGOING CONVERSATION SURE OKAY ANY OTHER. ISLANDS OKAY SO WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE YEAR RUN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS MINDS. SURE SO I A I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE HEARD A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THIS SO I'LL JUST BE REALLY BRIEF WE ARE REQUESTING THREE POINT SIX MILLION AN IMAGE SAY FUNDS -- OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO CONTRACT WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO TO CREATE A STATEWIDE -- PEER RUN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS LINE SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING -- FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. OKAY THANK YOU ALEJO COMMENTS FINANCE NEW PERSON AT THE TABLE YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF. UNKNOWN CONFRONT IN FINANCE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WELCOME. BETWEEN AT THE LA GOES TOO MUCH PUBLIC COMMENT. TYLER ANY WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION -- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF PHAM PURE BASED PAPER HOUSE ON SERVICES IN GENERAL AND AGREE THAT PROVIDING CARE SERVICES THROUGH A CRISIS LINE CAN BE AN IMPORTANT WAY TO REACH MORE CALIFORNIANS. WERE EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES OR CALM CONDITIONS WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS HOWEVER ON HOW THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED -- WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME ASPECTS OF THE CRISIS LINE MAY BE DUPLICATIVE -- AS WE HAVE THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF SUICIDE PREVENTION AND CRISIS FIND OPERATED. BUT BY COUNTIES AND AT THE STATE LEVEL WHICH DOES INCLUDE PEERS AND PROVIDERS WITH FIVE TO EXPERIENCE -- ADDITIONALLY THERE SHOULD BE A QUALITY COMPONENT TO THIS AS A PART OF ON THE COUNTY'S OPERATION OF THESE LINES ALONG SIDE WITH -- APP BASED PEER RUN PLATFORMS COUNTIES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH RESEARCHERS IN ENSURING ONGOING QUALITY MONITORING AND ASSESSING OUTCOMES FOR THE SUICIDE PREVENTION POP FORMS -- FINALLY WE WOULD WANT TO ENSURE ON COORDINATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS OF CARE -- PEOPLE THAT WILL CALL THE CRISIS LINE WILL NEED REFERRALS TO ON GOING CARE -- AND SERVICES WITHIN THE PUBLICLY FUNDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT SYSTEM SO WHILE WE ARE AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS IN CONCEPT. I'M IT THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AT THE STATE THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW TO COORDINATE THE STRATEGY WITH EXISTING RESOURCES THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. PERSON. OKAY SO -- THANK YOU. AS CERTAINLY WHY MEASURE WE INTEGRATE WITH EXISTING SERVICES AS WELL OKAY ALL RIGHT SO WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN CREATORS COMMENTS OKAY ISSUE NUMBER SIX NOT A WHOLE PERSON CARE COUNTIES. FOR SERVICE PART OF THE JANUARY BUDGET -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO GO TO SUPPORT THE TWENTY FIVE WHOLE PERSON CARE. KILEY IT'S TO HELP CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A HOUSING SPECIFICALLY HOUSING SERVICES AND THOSE WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS -- AS WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE IN IN THIS COMMITTEE THE FUTURE OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND WHAT HAPPENS POST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROPOSED -- TWENTY TWENTY WE REALLY YEAR. THOUGHT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN THIS IS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN WHOLE PERSON CARE. TO REALLY HELP THEM -- SHRIMP GET TO A PLACE WHERE WHEN WERE IN A PLACE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO HOPEFULLY SPREAD -- MORE STATE WIDE THE THE GOOD PARTS OF HOLD POWER POLL PERSON CARE THAT THEY WON'T BE SORT OF BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT A PART OF THE THE INITIAL. PILOT PROGRAMS AND I SAY THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY COUNTIES MIGHT NOT HAVE -- PARTICIPATED IN WHOLE PERSON CARE ONE OF THEM BEING JUST THE LACK OF NON FEDERAL FUNDING -- AND SO THIS IS ESSENTIALLY GRANT FUNDING TO HELP THEM -- SORT OF GET IT GET READY [inaudible] FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE OKAY HELLO FINANCE. THE MEMBERS. JUST THE TWO CLARIFIED THE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING AND APPRECIATE WE'RE GOING FROM PILOT TO MAKE IT MORE SO APPRECIATE -- NOT JUST IN THE PILOT STAGE -- THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT IN ANY SORT OF LOCAL FUNDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH OKAY SO WHAT IS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD SO ARE WE STILL GOING TO HAVE A SITUATION WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOME ENTITIES ARE PUTTING LOCAL FUNDS AND OTHER ONES DON'T ARE WE GONNA THEN. ELIMINATE THAT FOR ALL THE COUNTY. THAT'S A CONVERSATION WILL HAVE TO HAVE. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- THE FUTURE HOLDERS IN CARE AND HOW WE BUILD THAT IN BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEED FOR A NON FEDERAL SHARE AND SO I THINK THAT CONVERSATION WILL HAVE TO HAPPEN -- AT THAT TIME FOR SOME INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THOSE WHO COULD NOT PUT IN FUNDING -- OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SO THAT THAT WE COULD GET TO A PLACE OF HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND WE ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO HAVE A STATE WIDE PROGRAM. OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE TRêN MOVED TO STATEWIDE PROGRAM I THINK. TO MOW YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT I THINK SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE. IS THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO CAME IN EARLY ARE CAME IN AS THE PILOTS -- THE ONE I'M GOING AWAY THINKING LIKE A WE GOT PUNISHED BECAUSE HE SAT FOR A PILOT BECAUSE THE ONES WHO FOLLOWED US NOW GOT EVERYTHING% PAID FOR WELL THEY DID GET A HUNDRED MILLION FROM IN JANUARY THAT WAS DOCTOR DID NOT REQUIRE MATCH I'LL JUST OKAY. SO THEY'RE EVERYONE'S GETTING MONEY WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT IN A MATCH. ALL RIGHT WELL I I JUST LOVE YOU SURE YEAH I IS THAT THIS IS MORE MECHANICAL SAYING BUT ALSO LIKE WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO I JUST SAID SO THE SURE THAT -- WE DON'T CREATE A SITUATION WHERE. BELIEVE ME YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THE WILL HEAR ABOUT IT TOO SO. I DECIDED UNDERSTAND.

SO THIS MONEY WE THINK IT'S JUST AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT AND WE LOOK FORWARD EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR SECURE NECESSARILY IS. WE THINK IT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT BECAUSE WE HAD GREAT OUT COMES A WHOLE PERSON CARE I DO WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LIKE WHICH WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR AS WELL FOR EXISTING PILOTS -- DTS DEVELOPED AN ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IN APRIL -- THAT HAS SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- WE WANT TO WORK WITH THEM TO WORK THOSE ISSUES OUT ONE IS THE TARGET POPULATION THE GOVERNOR INDICATES THAT THIS MONEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH IS -- A BIG INCLUDES MANY HOPE PERSON CARE AND RELEASE BUT EACH COUNTY SET THEIR TARGET POPULATION AND HOPE PERSON CARE SERVICE PEOPLE WITH JUST CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AS WELL. SO WE WANT -- TO HAVE THE MONEY MATCH THE TARGET POPULATION IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT AND IT'S THE IT'S DIFFERENT BY COUNTY -- SECONDLY AND LASTLY -- ON THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY. THERE -- IT'S THE GOVERNOR INDICATES HE WANTS IT FOR HOUSING SERVICES INCLUDING SHORT TERM OR LONG STERN TERM STAYS VOUCHERS SHELTER THINGS LIKE THAT WE NEED THE MONEY REALLY FOR TENANTS SERVICES SO THAT THE MONEY LIKE.

ON THERE WERE ALSO SUPPORT OF LEGISLATION MOVING FOR NOT DIRECTION AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO NO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE -- IN REGARDS TO DELEGATED ENTITIES IS THAT PART OF THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO THIS -- THIS WOULD COVER SORT OF THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THAT I THINK WE ARE WE HAVE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD SOME CONCERNING ISSUES SEVENTH POPPED UP IN THE RECENT YEARS. THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED AND SO WE HAVE BEEN INCREASING OUR OVERSIGHT OF DELEGATED AND SEASON GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT SO THIS WOULD SUPPORT THAT BUT IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY TIED TO THAT. OKAY SO I THE ESTATE A. THINK WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS IS THAT. JUST WON'T BE SURE THERE'S CLARITY SELF IT'S THEY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT DELEGATED ENTITIES BUT DO I MAKE SURE THAT AS YOU ARE ACTUALLY. DOING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY AND CLARITY. ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO -- TO BE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS PROCESS THAT THERE'S CLEARLY ALSO THEN. AGAIN WE ARE NEVER WON WE HOPE WE NEVER HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE WE EVER NEED TO DO THIS -- BUT THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AT LEAST THE HOURS THESE THE PLAN HAS TO HAVE. RESPONSIBILITY OVER DELEGATED ENERGY BUT THE PRIDE DEL THEY AGAIN WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERSIGHT OVER TO DELEGATE ANY DISCOUNTS CAN SIMPLY SAY NOT OUR PROBLEM. OKAY.

A.'S WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SO IN THE MAY REVISION IT DOES REFLECT A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING FROM THE PROP SIXTY FOUR ACCOUNT -- WE WILL BE PROVIDING TWELVE MILLION OF THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR SURVEILLANCE IN EDUCATION -- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WOULD BE GETTING A LITTLE OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND SLOTS FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES FOR AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER CARE PROGRAMS -- THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY WILL RECEIVE TWENTY ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL SUPPORT LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT EMPHASIZE PREVENTION AND EDUCATION THAT WOULD BE THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM. THAT PER THE PROPOSITION WE WILL NEED TO DEVELOP THE PARAMETERS FOR WITH A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT WE ARE PLANNING.
