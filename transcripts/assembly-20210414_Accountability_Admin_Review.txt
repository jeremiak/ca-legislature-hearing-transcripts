PURCHASE CALIFORNIA GROWN FOOD WHEN AVAILABLE AND WERE NOT AVAILABLE THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO US GROWN FOOD OVER FOREIGN FOOD CURRENT LAW DIRECTS OUR INSTITUTION INSTITUTIONS TO GIVE PREFERENCE FOR FOOD GROWN IN THE STATE WHEN THE PRICE OF CALIFORNIA PRODUCE DOES NOT EXCEED THE OTHER STATE PROGRAMS BY MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT HOWEVER CURRENT LAW EXEMPTS OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE AMONG THE LARGEST PUBLIC INSTITUTIONAL PURCHASERS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WHILE FEDERAL LONG TO THE BUY AMERICA PROVISION THAT REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PURCHASE DOMESTIC COMMODITIES AND PRODUCTS FOR SCHOOL MEALS LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO PURCHASE CHEAPER FOREIGN PRODUCTS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA GROWN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE THE SACRAMENTO BEE STORY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOUND THAT THE SACRAMENTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT PURCHASE CANNED PEACHES AND MIXED FRUIT FROM CHINA IN VIOLATION OF BUY AMERICA POLICIES EVEN THOUGH NEARLY ALL US CANNED PEACHES AND PLASTIC PACKAGE PEACHES ARE GROWN HERE IN CALIFORNIA FURTHERMORE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE STATE AUDITOR ISSUED A REPORT THAT FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS REVIEW REVIEWED HAVE ADEQUATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT BUY AMERICA LAWS AND THEY HAD TO PURCHASE FOREIGN SOURCE FOOD ITEMS BUT DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION TO JUSTIFY THOSE PURCHASES DESPITE OUR STATE AGRICULTURAL STRENGTH PRODUCERS FACE COMPETITION FROM NON DOMESTIC PRODUCERS IN CHINA MEXICO ANOTHER NATIONS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE SAME LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND QUALITY CONTROL AS WE DO SOMETHING THAT WE ARE EXTREMELY PROUD OF -- IN ORDER TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION SPEND NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY ON FOOD PURCHASING AND CALIFORNIA
