BILL DOES IS IT PROVIDES THE

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:45.363
SAME KINDS ALTHOUGH EVEN MORE

CONSTRAINED OF VETERANS

FIFTY STATES AND THE FEDERAL

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:51.669

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:53.671
GOVERNMENTAL HIRING. ALSO

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:55.440
PROVIDES SOMETHING THAT'S EVEN

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:56.341
MORE CONSTRAINED THAT WHAT

00:27:56.408 --> 00:27:58.109
EXIST IN THIRTY NINE OTHER

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:01.112
STATES- AND I APPRECIATE MR

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.081
BAKERIES RAISE CONCERNS AND-

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:04.983
IMPROVE THE BILL SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.317
AS I MENTIONED THE OPENING.

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:08.420
THAT ANYONE WHO WAS DISCHARGED

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:11.056
UNDER THE- PROVISIONS THAT

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:12.791
PROVIDED FOR DISCHARGE OF

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:13.992
INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:16.127
SEXUAL ORIENTATION THAT THAT

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:17.228
THEY WOULD BE TREATED AS A

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:19.497
VETERAN FOR ALL PURPOSES. UNDER

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:22.200
THIS BILL SO. THE CONCERN I

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:24.636
THINK OF THE ACLU IS IT HAS A

00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:26.438
DISPARATE IMPACT IN OTHER WORDS

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:29.307
OF THE UNIVERSE OF VETERANS IS.

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.975
A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MALE AND

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:33.411
HIS FEMALE- AND THERE HAVE BEEN

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:34.612
PAST DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:35.980
OF THE MILITARY ONE THE MOST

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:37.282
EGREGIOUS WAS DISCRIMINATING

00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:39.451
BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.653
YOUR- GENDER UP AFFIRMATION

00:28:41.719 --> 00:28:43.888
THAT KIND OF THING. BOB THAT'S

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:44.889
NOT THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:46.991
TODAY BUT THE QUESTION IS DO WE

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:49.961
BASICALLY NOT PROVIDE BUT FIFTY

00:28:50.028 --> 00:28:51.463
STATES ARE PROVIDING BECAUSE

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:52.464
THE PAST DISCRIMINATION

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.599
MILITARY I THINK NOT I MEAN I

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:55.700
THINK THE REASON PEOPLE THAT

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.202
THEY CAN DISAGREE. AND IT DOES

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:59.037
HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT IT HAS

00:28:59.104 --> 00:29:02.574
A DISK IT IS. GOING TO

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.375
DISCREETLY IMPACTED TINO'S

00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:06.277
BECAUSE LATINOS FORM A GREATER

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:07.779
PORTION OF THE MILITARY THAN

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:09.214
THEY DO THE GENERAL POPULATION

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.181
THE SAME THING WITH AFRICAN

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:12.083
AMERICANS IT'S GOING TO HAVE A

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.351
DISPARATE IMPACT BECAUSE

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.420
AFRICAN AMERICANS COMPRISE A

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:16.721
LARGER PORTION MILITARY THAN

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:19.657
THE GENERAL POPULATION. SO AND

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:22.460
I UNDERSTAND THAT- THERE'S AN

00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:24.462
ISSUE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSE.

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:29.100
OF POTENTIAL APPLICANTS- A

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:31.069
SKEWS MALE IT DOES SKEW MALE

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:32.770
IT'S CHANGING AS WAS POINTED

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:33.471
OUT WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:35.874
MILITARY WAS NOT. 8% FEMALE

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.777
NOW- IT'S 20% THE RECRUITS AND

00:29:39.844 --> 00:29:41.746
SO- WHAT THIS DOES IS IT DOES

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:43.515
IT RECOGNIZE THE SERVICE ALSO

YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT- THE

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:03.835
REASON WHY THIS BILL CAN NOT

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:05.537
EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT DISPARATE

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:06.604
IMPACT DISCRIMINATION IS

00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:08.006
BECAUSE YOU'RE A KNOWLEDGE

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:09.774

YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY THIS

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:20.685
PRINCIPLE YOU WOULD SAY THAT WE

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:22.320
SHOULD REVOKE THE PREFERENCE IN

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:24.489

VETERANS IT WILL NOT BE IN MY

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.268
LIFETIME I GUESS IT WON'T BE IN

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:38.903
ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES SO THE

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.072
QUESTION IS SO EIGHT EIGHT A

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.273
FEMALE WHO'S LEAVING THE

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.210
MILITARY FORCE TODAY. COMING

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:47.512
BACK- IS A DISPROPORTION BY THE

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.347
WAY VETERANS WHO. SUFFER

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:51.616
DISABILITY COMING BACK FROM

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:53.284

THIRTY NINE OTHER STATES- IN

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:01.492
THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE FIFTY

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:04.696
OTHER STATES. BECAUSE YOU'VE

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:07.599
GOT TO WAIT UNTIL THE RATIO IS

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:09.867
EQUAL. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:11.169
I THINK WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE

00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:12.704
THEIR SERVICE PROVIDE PRIVATE

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.473

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.276
GOVERNMENT PLAYERS. BUT IF I

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:21.045
MAY I MEAN. THE COMMITTEE

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:23.448
ANALYSIS DOES POINT OUT. THAT

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:25.083
THIS ISN'T JUST A MATTER OF

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:26.985
SPECULATION BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:30.521
THERE HAVE BEEN- FEDERAL AND

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:33.191
STATE CASES FEDERAL CASES. THAT

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:36.828

GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:04.208
THEY'RE TRAINED AND CONDITIONED

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:07.478
BY THE MILITARY. WHEN THEY GET

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:09.747

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:14.252
IN MY CASE NINE YEARS LATER.

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:17.088
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:18.556
TRANSITION AND IT'S VERY

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:20.758
DIFFICULT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:22.160

HIGHER SUICIDE RATE PER CAPITA.

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.881

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.850
EVEN MORE PROBLEMS TRANSITION

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:49.253
