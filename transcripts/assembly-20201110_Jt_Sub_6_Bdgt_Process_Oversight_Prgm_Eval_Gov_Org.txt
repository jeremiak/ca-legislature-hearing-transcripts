COMMENTS FROM AGAIN YOUKNOW WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE THE MIDDLE THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA HAS APPROACHING CLOSE TO ONE MILLION COVERT CASES IN NEARLY. EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DEATHS- WE IN PARTICULAR ARE DISCUSSING HOW WE APPROACH EMERGENCIES A TYPICAL EMERGENCY LAST FOR A FEW DAYS OR FEW WEEKS- THE ONLY EMERGENCY IN RECENT HISTORY THAT WENT ON FOR MORE THAN THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WAS THE STATE DROUGHT. IN OBVIOUSLY THE RESPONSE WAS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF RESPONSE WE ARE NOT USED TO HAVING AN EMERGENCY WHICH TOUCHES EVERY FACET OF OUR LIVES IN EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE ENTIRE STATE. SO DOING SO WHERE CAN WE WANT TO EXPLORE AND MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE AGAIN CONTINUING TO OPERATE A WALL IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY BUT WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND RUN THE STATE IN A DEMOCRATIC FASHION. WITH GREATER TRANSPARENCY MORE OPENNESS IN INVOLVEMENT- FROM THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. SO FOR OUR FIRST PANEL YOU YOU'RE RECEIVING AN UPDATE OVERVIEW. OF AVAILABLE IN ANTICIPATED STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS PROVIDED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. THE SECOND PANEL WILL REVIEW THE P. P. ET CONTRACT PROCUREMENT PROCESS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF PPE TO SECTORS. THAT ARE IN NEED. I THINK THE- OVERALL I KNOW THAT MYSELF AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES. WANT TO CAN STOP MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE PROPER LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME ENSURE THAT THERE IS A GREATER COMMUNICATION WITH THE- DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AS WELL AS- WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS AGAIN VERY VERY MUCH. TOP OF MIND FOR ALL OF US. SO LET US START WITH THE FIRST PANEL WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I LET'S BEGIN WITH THE. HELLO ARE YOU THERE. IF YOU JUST START TALKING THE YOU'LL COME ON SCREEN. FOR THE WHOLE WE HAVE MISS HOLLINGSHEAD AND MISS PETERS FROM THE LA OFFICE. OKAY OF MISS HOLLINGSHEAD OR MISS PETERS IF YOU COULD ON MUTE YOURSELF. AND THEN ONCE YOU START TALKING YOU WILL APPEAR ON SCREEN. EVERYONE ON THE WEBEX WE'RE HEARING A FROM WE HAVE AN ONLINE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY KICKED IT OVER TO YOU AND- SO IT'S JUST IT'S HARD TO HEAR YOU HAVE TO KIND OF HAVE A HEARING ON THE SIDE IT LOOKS LIKE BUT. PETERS FROM OUR OFFICE WILL BE THE FIRST PERSON TO SPEAK. OKAY PERFECT SO MISS PETERS. MORNING CARE MAINTAIN CHAIRMAN GREAT AND MEMBERS AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE THE HEARINGS I JUST WANT TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE IN HER EYES WE CAN WE CAN SEE AND HEAR YOU SO THANK YOU GREAT I WILL GOOD MORNING AGAIN I'M JUST COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'M IN THIS FIRST PANEL AND YOU'LL BE HEARING AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO THE COULD BE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND I AM GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW AT THE STATE'S EMERGENCY POWERS GENERALLY. SOME ISSUES AND OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF EMERGENCY POWERS DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I THINK ABOUT SINCE MAKE SOME. ABOUT PUTTING CHANGES TO THE STATE'S EMERGENCY LIGHTS. FOR THE FIRST HAVE EXTEND EMERGE APART THE GOVERNOR HAS BY AUTHORITY TO DECLARE AND- UNDER VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING AN EPIDEMIC. ONCE AN EMERGENCY IS DECLARED THE GOVERNOR'S GRANTED SIGNIFICANT POWERS TO RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY TO PROTECT THE LIVES AND. SAFETY OF PEOPLE AND PROPERTY IN THE STATE. MANY OF THESE CAN BE. TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE YES. THESE CARS PROVIDE ADMINISTRATION WITH MIKE'S ABILITY NEEDED TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. EIGHT HOURS PROVIDED DURING AN EMERGENCY INCLUDE ISSUING AN IMPROVING. FOR EVERY ELSE WAS ON THE WAY IF THEY COULD PLEASE MUTE OR MAKE SURE THEIR MUTED- THERE'S WE'RE HEARING SOME RESIDUAL NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND SO IF YOU COULD DO THAT PLEASE THANK YOU. PLEASE CONTINUE SPEAKERS. I WAS THE MAJOR POWERS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THEM INITIATIONDURING AN EMERGENCY INCLUDE ISSUING AND ENFORCING EMERGENCY ORDERS AND REGULATIONS. MMHM SAYS PENDING EXISTING REGULATIONS ARE LIVE DIRECTING THE ACTIVITIES OF STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING REDIRECTING FUNDING WITHIN DEPARTMENTS AND VARIOUS OTHER BROAD SPENDING AUTHORITIES THAT GET THE MINISTRATION ACCESS TO THE FUNDING NEEDED TO PAY FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. AT THE END OF AN EMERGENCY UNDER CURRENT LAW THE GOVERNOR'S REQUIRED TO PROCLAIM AN END TO THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE THAT CONDITIONS WEREN'T. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO HAS THE POWER TO END AN EMERGENCY OUT BY A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION. UNLIKE LOCALLY DECLARED EMERGENCIES IN THE STATE WHICH EXPIRE AUTOMATICALLY UNLESS A RATIFIED BY LOCAL GOVERNING BODY WITHIN SEVEN DAYS. ARE THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR AUTOMATIC EXPIRATION OF THE STATE DECLARED EMERGENCY. IN THOSE LOCAL EMERGENCIES AS WELL THE LOCAL GOVERNING BODY IS GRANTED THE AUTHORITY TO ANY EMERGENCY AFTER THEY RATIFIED IT. AND THEY HVE TO REVIEW THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION EVERY SIXTY. I'M JUST IN CONTRAST TO THE STATE FARM STATEWIDE EMERGENCY PROCESS. I'M DURING ITS STATE EMERGENCY R. O. YES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING OVERALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE BY STATE AGENCIES AND COORDINATING WITH FEDERAL AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND THROUGH THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. OTHER STATE AGENCIES CAN ALSO TAKE A MAJOR ROLE IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR EXAMPLE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC- THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR CD P. H. IS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES THE STATE WILL TAKE. AND YES OPERATE THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND WILL MISSION TSK DEPARTMENTS OR ASSIGNED DEPARTMENTS WITH. SPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITIES TAKEN. IN ORDER TO FUND THE COST OF STATE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COORDINATES OVERALL FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. IN RECENT EMERGENCIES INCLUDING THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES ISSUE BUDGET LETTERS WHICH ARE INSTRUCTIONS TO STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES REQUIRING THEM TO REPORT ON ALL EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES. STATE AGENCIES THAT REPORT THEIR EMERGENCY COST APART DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND APARTMENT OF FINANCE DETERMINES WHETHER EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE DEPARTMENT OR PAID FOR WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES BY REDIRECTING CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR WHETHER DEPARTMENT REQUIRES AN AUGMENTATION TO ITS OVERALL BUDGET. WHILE THE MINISTRY HAS MORE IN FOR AUTHORITY EVERY OTHER. AND THEY'RE SOMETIMES COMBINED TOGETHER IN PRACTICE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS FUNNELED EMERGENCY AUGMENTATIONS. THREE THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT KNOWN INJURY A LOT. STATE LAW LIMITS THE USE OF THREE I GENERALLY TO WITHIN ONE FISCAL YEAR OF THE START OF AN EMERGENCY. THIS IS BECAUSE STATE LAW ASSUMES THAT IF AN EMERGENCY WERE TO SPAN MULTIPLE YEARS ADMINISTRATION HAVE THE ABILITY TO PLAN FOR THE SECOND YEAR OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE COSTS TO THE STATE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. DRILL IS AVAILABLE THIS FISCAL YEAR UNDER EXISTING LAW WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE MINISTRATION NEXT FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOWEVER ADMINISTRATION STILL HAS VERY BROAD SPENDING AUTHORITIES AVAILABLE TO IT. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT AND THESE WILL REMAIN AVAILABLE AND TELL THAT. OF THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION HAS BEEN ADDED. IN GENERAL STATE LAW REQUIRES LITTLE IN THE WAY OF REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE ALLOCATIONS OF FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. HOWEVER IT'S COMMON PRACTICE FOR THE MINISTRATION TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE INFORMATION UPON REQUEST. EVEN IF IT'S NOT REQUIRED BY STATE LAW. FOR EXAMPLE THE MINISTRATION HAS AGREED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS TO PROVIDE UPDATES MONTHLY ON KOBE IT FISCAL AND SPENDING AND RESPONSE FUNDING. HOWEVER AT THIS TIME WE WOULD KNOW THESE REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED MONTHLY BUT IF INCOMING AND- LESS FREQUENTLY ON A PERIODIC BASIS. NEXT I WANT TO MOVE TO ISSUES AND OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE OVERALL RESPONSE TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE BRIDE EMERGENCY POWERS GRANTED TO THE GOVERNOR GIVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE MINISTRATION TO DETERMINE HOW TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. GIVEN THE ONGOING NATURE OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN EMERGENCY AND GIVEN THAT RESPONDING TO PANDEMICS IS MUCH LESS COMMON THAN OTHER TYPES OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE. UNDERSTANDING THE OVER ARCHING STRATEGY AND KEY ACTIONS ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTAND AS OVERSEAS THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO THIS EMERGENCY. WE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE OVERSIGHT. YOU MAY WANT TO ASK THE PANELISTS LEADER IN THIS HEARING OR AT FUTURE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS THIS FALL. ON THOSE QUESTIONS FIRST ON THE OVERALL STRATEGY THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING ITS ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPING. AN OVERARCHING PLAN TO RESPOND TO THE COPING NINETEEN PANDEMIC. A PLAN THAT WOULD INTEGRATE THE BLUEPRINT FOR SAFER ECONOMY. WITH EFFORTS TO EXPAND TESTING CAPACITY AND ALIGN WITH THE PACE AND SCALE OF PP OR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PROCUREMENT. AS WELL AS OTHER ACTIVITIES. I'M WHAT WOULD- YESS ROLE BE IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SUCH A PLAN AND TO THE EXTENT DEMONSTRATION HOW SUCH A PLAN IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I'M FOR- YES HOW ARE THEY BALANCING ON THE VARIOUS ROLES THEY HAVE TO MISSION TASK DEPARTMENTS WITH SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES. WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERALL COORDINATION- AND STRATEGIC PLANNING OF THEIR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE ACTIVITIES HAVE THE COPING NINETEEN RESPONSE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN TODAY AND EFFECTIVE. WHICH STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND HOUSE EFFECTIVENESS BEING MEASURE HAS- YES IDENTIFIED ANY GAPS IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE AND WHAT I'M STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO ADDRESS THOSE GAPS. AND ALSO INCORPORATING PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES EMERGENCY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR COMMONS AT WILDFIRE OTHER TYPE OF EMERGENCY WHERE THE RESPONSE IS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD. ON THIS RESPONSE IS COMPLEX AND HOW IS- YES I'M WORKING WITH CD PH TEN CORPORATION. AND THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA INTO THE STATE'S RESPONSE STRATEGIES. NEXT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME ISSUES IN OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS REGARDING THE STATE'S EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES. THIS STATE HAS VARIOUS EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES THAT GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION FLEXIBILITY TO REALLY SEND ANY AVAILABLE FUNDS TO RESPOND TO AN EMERGENCY. THESE SPENDING DECISIONS TAKE PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE'S THE REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME LEVEL OF LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY THAT SPENDING DECISIONS- ARE WHEN THEY'RE MADE THROUGH THE BUDGET OR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THESE. THE EXPANSIVENESS OF THESE EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES ALSO RAISES SOME ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. IN REGARD TO THE OVERSIGHT OF KOBE NINETEEN AS WELL AS MORE BROADLY FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES. SOME OF THE KEY OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED INCLUDE OVERALL SPENDING ON RESPONSE ACTIVITIES IS A LEGISLATURE SATISFIED WITH HOW THE SPENDING HAS BEEN ALLOCATED. SUCH AS BY PROGRAM AREA TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND THE GROUPS THAT ARE BEING STARVED. OUR OH YES AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COORDINATING TO DETERMINE PRIORITIES FOR FUNDING AND THE FUNDING LEVELS TO PRIDE FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. REGARDING THE MONTHLY UPDATES ADMINISTRATION HAS AGREED IN HEARINGS TO PROVIDE MONTHLY FISCAL UPDATES ON COVERED NINETEENTH RESPONSE SPENDING. THIS INFORMATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT ITS OVERSIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES. AND THEIR OVERALL RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER SO FAR THESE UPDATES HAVE ONLY BEEN PROVIDED IN MAY AUGUST AND NOVEMBER. WHAT CHALLENGES AS THE MINISTRATION FACING WITH PROVIDING MONTHLY REPORTS AND HOW CAN THESE CHALLENGES BE OVERCOMES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN PROVIDE REPORTS MONTHLY AS PROMISED. THEN LOOKING AT AUGMENTATIONS TO DEPARTMENTS BUDGET BUDGETS VERSUS READER ACTIONS HOW IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DETERMINING WHEN TO PROVIDE AUGMENTATIONS TO DEPARTMENTS. VERSES REQUIRING THEM TO REDIRECT RESOURCES INTERNALLY- OR ABSORB THOSE COSTS ARE THESE INTERNAL RE DIRECTIONS OF RESOURCES BEING TRACKED AND WILL THIS INFORMATION BE REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE SO LEGISLATURE. I'M AND THEN ALSO WITH THE OVERALL FUNDING AUTHORITY FOR NEXT YEAR AND AS I SAID THE DRILL AT THIRTY WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. HOW IS THE MINISTRATION PLANNING TO FIND COPING NINETEEN MARGINS THE RESPONSE IN THE NEXT FISCAL FISCAL YEAR GIVEN THAT. AND LASTLY I WANT TO SHARE SOME COMMENTS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL LONG TERM CHANGES TO THE STATE'S EMERGENCY LIFE. EXISTING EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT RESPUBLIKA NINETEEN SEVENTY. IT'S UNLIKELY THAT A SITUATION OF A LENGTHY ONGOING EMERGENCY. THAT BROADLY IMPACTS THE ECONOMY AND EVERYDAY LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. WAS NOT CONTEMPLATED WHEN THE ACT WAS WRITTEN. THE ONGOING NATURE OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN EMERGENCY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RESPONSE TO THIS EMERGENCY. RAISES QUESTIONS AROUND WHETHER THE STATE'S EMERGENCY LAW SHOULD BE CHANGED. YOUR STAFF HAS ASKED US TO PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON SUCH POTENTIAL CHANGES. THERE'S REALLY TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF THE TYPES OF AND CHANGES THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE STATE'S EMERGENCY LIGHTS. I'M IN ONE CATEGORY THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE CHANGES TO LIMIT THE ADMINISTRATION'S EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER THIS WOULD LIKELY LIMIT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO RESPONDING NIMBLY TO EMERGENCIES. I NEVER HAD A GREAT CHANGES THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED WOULD BE TO RETAIN HIS BRIDE EMERGENCY POWERS AND RETAIN ADMINISTRATION FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. WHILE ADDING IN CHECKS AND BALANCES TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF EMERGENCY DECISION. FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRING REPORTING ON EMERGENCY SPENDING WE GET THE LEGISLATURE INFORMATION NEEDED TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT. ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO EMERGENCIES. I WOULD ALSO AVOID CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS REQUESTED INFORMATION BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROVIDING IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. OTHER CHANGES COULD INCLUDE REQUIRING ADMINISTRATION TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE OF PLANNED ACTIVITIES BEFORE FUNDS ARE SPENT. OR PLACING LIMITS ON TOTAL SPENDING TO ENSURE THAT THE TOTAL SPENDING ON EMERGENCIES DOES NOT HAVE OVERALL BUDGETARY IMPACTS THAT COULD UNDERMINE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I AM HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME OR TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- AND HOLLINGSHEAD WHO HAS A PRESENTATION ON THE OVERALL FUNDING- PROVIDED FOR COVERS. MISTER TERRY I'M SORRY BUT WE ARE UNABLE TO HEAR YOU SO WE ARE UNCLEAR WHETHER YOU'RE ASKING US QUESTIONS OR WHETHER YOU WANT THEM TO MAKE HER PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO TO MISS HOLLINGSHEAD AND THEY WILL- AFTER WHAT THE PANEL'S SPEAKING THE WATER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND HAULING SAID AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I MEAN TO BE SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY FOR MY HAND OUT AND THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FOLLOWING ALONG AT HOME. YOU CAN FIND IT ON THE L. A. O. DOT CA DOC OF. SO JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES COMENTS ABOUT AUTHORITY I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT. WILL BE NINETEEN SPENDING. VERY BROADLY IN THE STATE BY BOTH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY HIGH LEVEL AND HOPEFULLY PRETTY QUICK BUT- I WILL FOCUS. A LITTLE BIT ON. THE AUTHORITY OF THE SOURCES OF AUTHORITY FOR VARIOUS. PARTS OF SPENDING. SO THIS WILL BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS SELLS TALK FIRST ABOUT THE FUNDS SOURCE M. AND FOCUS THEIR OWN AUTHORITY THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT. AND THEN I FINALLY CONCLUDED WITH PROGRAM AREA. SO ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. UP FRONT SOURCES RECALLED IN NINETEEN RELATED SPENDING SO AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS. THAT FIGURE AT THE BY FAR THE LARGEST SINGLE AMOUNT THAT HAS BEEN SPENT ON PUBLIC NINETEEN BY EITHER THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THESE ARE THE BENEFIT ENHANCEMENTS THAT WERE PASSED AS PART OF THE CARE IS ACTIVE AND THEN LATER PERSONALLY EXTENDED UNDER EXECUTIVE ACTION- BUT ESSENTIALLY PROVIDED MORE BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE TO YOU FOR YOU WHY. AND THEN ALSO EXTENDED YOU ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY INELIGIBLE INCLUDING THE SELF EMPLOYED. THE STATE REALLY DOES NOT HAVE. A ROLE IN DETERMINING HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED- THE STATE IS REALLY JUST KIND OF A PASSED THROUGH FOR THOSE FUNDS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE INCLUDED HERE. BUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE GRAPHIC THIS STATE HAS VARYING DEGREES OF AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO INFLUENCE HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT AND THE LEGISLATURE IN PARTICULAR- HAS SORT OF DIFFERENT ROLES DEPENDING ON WHICH PART OF MONEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT. EVEN WHEN WE FOCUS ON THE REMAINING IECES. THIS IS REALLY AGAIN MOSTLY AN OVERWHELMINGLY. MAJORITY FEDERAL MONEY. SO JUST GIVE A CALL OF EGGS THE- RELIEF I ARE C. ALFA. WELL PASSED AS PART OF THE CARE IS ACTIVE PROVIDED NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE. AND ON THE LEGISLATURE DID ALLOCATE SIERRA THREE WOULD BE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PROCESS. BUT THERE WAS ALSO CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROVIDED AS PART OF THAT ALLOCATION ALLOWING THE ADMINISTRATION TO RE DIRECT- GOT FUNDING IF IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE SPENT BY THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR WHICH IS THE DEADLINE. FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SET FOR AND SPENDING CRF MONEY. ANOTHER IS SORT OF- IMPORTANT EXAMPLE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT A THIRTY ON THE ROLE OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS THE STATE FUNDING PIECE AND THIS IS THE PIECE THAT SEAN AND BROWN. AN IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE I TALK ABOUT A THIRTY IS THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S LIFE THERE IS ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THE ACTUAL STATE GENERAL FUND IMPLICATION OF THAT IS GOING TO BE. PERHAPS A QUARTER OF THAT AMOUNT AND THE REASON THAT IT'S- THAT IT'S LOWER IS THAT THE STATE WILL EVENTUALLY BE. REIMBURSED ABOUT 75% BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THESE OUTLAYS BUT- THEY ARE STATE DIRECTED AND- THE STATE HAS. SORT OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND HOW TO SPEND THIS MONEY. SO THIS THIS FUNDING HAS REALLY BEEN ALLOCATED IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS BUT- PRIMARILY THROUGH- THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S DISASTER AND EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES THAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS SPEAKING TO EARLIER IN PARTICULAR- THE DISASTER RESPONSE IN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS A COUNTER JURY A LOT. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE. THIS GRAPHIC OR OR SET OF GRAPHICS SHOWS NINETEEN SPENDING BY PROFESSOR BY TYPE AND WE'VE DIVIDED IT INTO SIX DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THE LARGEST YOU SHOWN IN ORANGE AND THEN IN THIS SORT OF SEAFOAM GREEN ARE CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF CORPORATE NINETEEN WHICH IS ACTIVITIES LIKE MASK PROCUREMENT TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING ARE CONTROLLING THE SPREAD AND THEN FACILITATE PHYSICAL DISTANCING WHICH ARE OF COURSE RELATED ACTIVITIES BUT THE SUPPORTS THAT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO. STAY AT HOME OR OTHERWISE ISOLATED FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT INCLUDES ACTIVITIES LIKE DISTANCE LEARNING FOR STUDENTS- ACQUIRING HOTEL AND MOTEL BEDS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE TOP OF THE FIGURE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FIGURE SHOWING THE SAME DATA. BUT THE TOP IS DESTROYING THE PROPORTION FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES AND THEN THE BOTTOM IS SHOWING- SORT OF SINGLE EXPENDITURE AMOUNTS WITHIN EACH. AND AS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE LARGER AMOUNTS INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE MONEY THAT'S GOING TO SCHOOLS TO FACILITATE OUR DISTANCE LEARNING. OR PURCHASES OF PPP AND PROCUREMENT OF OTHER OF OTHER MEDICAL SUPPLIES. STE AND THEN TO THE FINAL PAGE THIS IS SIMILAR AT THE SAME PER BASIS OF DATA BUT BUT PROVIDED WITH THAT KIND OF DIFFERENT HI SO THIS IS SHOWING YOU BY PROGRAM AREA AND THEN BY THE SIX DIFFERENT- CATEGORIES THAT I THAT I HATE TO SPOKE ABOUT ON THE LAST PAGE SO AND THE LARGEST SINGLE PROGRAM AREA IN WHICH I THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE SPENDING MONEY pCOURSE HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. AND THEN THE SECOND LARGEST CATEGORY IS FOR EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE AND MOST OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO FACILITATE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND IN AND IN PARTICULAR THAT'S FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. pPERFORMANCE AND THE MISTER BASS. HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS THERESA KALRA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE STEVEN BENSON TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE OUR LATEST FISCAL INFORMATION RELATED TO KOBE IN NINETEEN AND TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE- I WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF TO ALLOW TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND AT THE END OF THIS PANEL- AND IN SOME IN AN EFFORT TO CONTINUE PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY IN PROVIDING REGULAR UPDATES POST BUDGET ACT. SAID DEPARTMENT FINANCES RELEASED IN THE US- BOTH RELEASED AN UPDATE IN AUGUST AND HAS JUST RELEASED ITS NOVEMBER FISCAL UPDATE THAT PROVIDES UPDATED FISCAL DETAIL AND INFORMATION RELATED TO EXPENDITURES IN VARIOUS PROGRAM CATEGORIES RELATED TO COPE IN NINETEEN- IN ADDITION IN SEPTEMBER FINANCE ALSO PROVIDED AN UPDATE. ON FEDERAL FUNDING. AT A FINANCE EARLY ESTIMATES. COMBINED TOTAL COSTS PRESIDENT NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEARS APPROXIMATELY NINE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WITH A CURRENTLY ESTIMATED THAT GENERAL FUND IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE BILLION. AT A HIGH LEVEL COMPARED TO THE AUGUST ESTIMATES THE TO YOUR COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION- THERE ARE TWO AT EXPENDITURE CATEGORIES WE HIGHLIGHT AS AS CONTRIBUTING TO. THIS INCREASED ON THE FIRST OF THE STATE LABORATORY TESTING. LABORATORY TESTING ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT A TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR VARIOUS TESTING EXPENDITURES I'M INCLUDING THE NEW IN STATE LABORATORY. CAPACITY THAT WILL EXPAND TO TESTING AVAILABLE IN THE STATE. IN ADDITION CONSISTENT WITH FUNDING PROVIDED AND- SB ONE FIFTEEN AN AMENDMENT TO THE BUDGET ACT- NOVEMBER COST ESTIMATE INCLUDES A LITTLE OVER SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS AND- GENERAL FUND FOR OUTREACH FOCUSED ON COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMIC SECTORS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY THE VIRUS AS WELL AS FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. M. AS ANOTHER POINT OF COMPARISON AND THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET REFLECTED A TOTAL OF EIGHT POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT EMERGENCY RESPONSE COSTS ACROSS THE SAME FISCAL YEAR SO- AS COMPARED FROM BUDGET ACT IN NOVEMBER IT'S AN INCREASE OF ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AND WE HAVE. ADDITIONAL COLLEAGUES HERE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AND FROM THE COMMITTEE AND- ARE AVAILABLE. AT THE END OF THE PANEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON. AND MR BENSON'S HERE FOR THAT THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THAT I AM. VERY GOOD THEN WE'RE GOING TO CHIU THIRTY DIRECTOR CURRY. IF FIVE CHIEF TO BE DIRECTOR CURRY COULD START SPEAKING- PERHAPS YOUR VIEW LOOKING ALL. YOU CAN WE SEE YOU. MISTER GREENE YES IF YOU COULD JUST START ALKING YOU'RE OKAY I THINK WE'VE GOT THAT WORKING. EXCELLENT WELL GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON'S IN GRAY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU AN UPDATE ON CALLOW YESS ROLE IN OUR SUPPORT. FOR THE OPERATIONAL EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO THIS ONGOING PANDEMIC I DON'T THINK I COULD SAY IT. BETTER THAN EITHER OF YOU TWO DID IN THE FACT THAT WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS- ARE MANAGING YOU KNOW SOMETHING JUST UNPRECEDENTED AND ONGOING AND OUR VIGILANCE AND ON OUR NEED TO STAY CONNECTED AND I KEEP THAT THE RESPONSE- GOING IS. SOMETHING THAT'S OF COURSE A TOP PRIORITY FOR OUR OFFICE AND FOR THE STATE AND SINCE EARLY IN TWENTY TWENTY WE BEGAN THIS YOU KNOW REALLY BACK TO JANUARY AND SO AND- THEN SUING MONTHS WE PLAYED A DIRECT ROLE IN COORDINATING THE STATE'S RESPONSE. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND MANY MANY OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE AS AS WE'VE CONTENDED WITH THIS RESPONSE IN THE MONTHS THAT HAVE ENSUED. THIS IS BEEN DONE FOR A SYSTEM THAT WERE ACCUSTOMED TO OR CUSTOM TO USING IT FOR OTHER DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES WITHIN CALIFORNIA EVERYTHING RANGING FROM THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER. TO SPECIALIZED TASK FORCES TO TACKLE- YOU KNOW HIGHLY COMPLEX AND TECHNICAL ISSUES AND AS WELL AS A UNIFIED COORDINATION GROUP AND THAT'S WHERE THE CABINET AGENCIES COME TOGETHER AND CONVENE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR EFFORTS ARE ALIGNED. OUR STATE OPERATIONS CENTER HAS BEEN ACTIVATED FOR THIS EVENT FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED DAYS NOW- IT IS NOT AND THE LONGEST ACTIVATION WE'VE HAD AS YOU MENTIONED SHERMAN TAKING THAT THE STATE DROUGHT WENT ON FOR YEARS. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY UNPRECEDENTED IN MANY WAYS AND I CERTAINLY REQUIRED US TO BE AT A LEVEL OF RESPONSE THAT IS A UNIQUE FOR SOMETHING THAT'S OF THIS DURATION IT'S ALSO A LAYERED SYSTEM SO WE HAVE EVERYTHING FROM TACTICAL OPERATIONS WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE WORKING DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL ORGANIZING IN THE RESPONSE. WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STRATEGIC LEVEL WITH THE DECISION MAKERS IN THE LEADERSHIP OF WORKING TOGETHER TO. DRIVE PRIORITIES AND- ND ENSURE THAT OUR RESPONSES EFFECTIVE. OUR OFFICE HAS A UNIQUE ROLE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES ARE ACROSS THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES- SOMETHING WERE AGAIN A CUSTOM TO BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT HAZARDS THAT WE FACE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THAT WE MANAGE ALL THE TIME- AND WE DEPLOY THOSE CAPABILITIES TO PROBLEM SOLVING AND TO MEET NEEDS IN THE TIME OF EMERGENCY DOES IT DISASTERS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE EMERGENCY PLAN THE STATE EMERGENCY PLAN IS WHAT OUTLINES. THE EMERGENCY ORGANIZATION AND CALIFORNIA THE PROCESSES THAT WE USE AND THE ROLES OF STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S A FLEXIBLE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WE TALK A LITTLE BIT LATER WITH ABOUT. ABOUT THE VACCINE PLANNING AND HOW THAT IS KIND OF RISING UP TO BE AT NEW AREA FOCUS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS ALL% THE OTHER AREAS. AS A FOCUS AND AT THE SAME TIME AS CASES ARISING IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GONNA BE CALLED BALANCING THE EFFORTS OF VACCINE PLANNING AND RESPONSE PERHAPS TO IN. IT NO NOT PERHAPS BUT TO INCREASE CASE RISING AND ALL THE THINGS THAT MIGHT ENSUE. WITH THE RESPONSE TO THOSE THINGS AND ALL THAT HAPPENS IN PARALLEL- JUST AREA THE FOCUS THAT WE'VE CORD ENDED THIS IS BY NOT NOT NOT AT ALL MEANS NON EXHAUSTIVE LIST BUT THINGS LIKE MEDICAL SURGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE EQUIPMENT FACILITIES. AVAILABLE TO HELP OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS A MEDICAL PROVIDERS. TO PROVIDE. CARE TO PEOPLE WITH THE COVERED NINETEEN ENFORCEMENT- THAT IS THERE'S BEEN OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CONTACTS MADE IN THE STATE FAMILY HAS COME TOGETHER- WITH EVERY AGENCY WHO AS A PART OF THIS TO NOT JUST PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO TO. LEVERAGE THEIR EFFORTS IN UNITY- TO PROVIDE ENFORCEMENT HOUSING AND SOCIAL SERVICES I THINK IT'S BEEN TOUCHED AND ALREADY MANY MANY. TYPES. OF PROGRAMS INCLUDING FOR HOMELESS. ON HEALTH WORKER SAID THAT THEY HAVE A SAFE AND SECURE. HOUSING AS THEY UNDERTAKE THIS TREMENDOUS JOB- AGRICULTURAL WORKFORCE AT CENTER ALL OF THAT TO EMPLOY. SAFETY MEASURES SO THAT WE ARE PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR CENTRAL. SERVICES CONTINUE. EMERGENCY FEEDING- ANOTHER AREA- FOOD BANK SUPPORT AT PROGRAMS LIKE GREAT PLATES WHERE THERE'S BEEN OVER FIFTEEN MILLION MEALS SERVED. TO A CALIFORNIANS AND THAT MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES PARTICIPATING. AND THEN GEOGRAPHIC BASED EFFORT TO WE'VE HAD MORE REAP OF LEAN DEN IF YOU WILL IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE THEY HAD VERY SPECIALIZED NEEDS CENTRAL VALLEY IS AN EXAMPLE IMPERIAL COUNTY- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN THAT'S BOTH T MAKE SURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE FULL. COORDINATED COHESIVE STATE SUPPORT BOTH ON THE PREVENTION SIDE AND TESTING CONTACT TRACING BUT ALSO ON THE RESPONSE SIDE. WITH THAT HELP WITH THEIR WITH THEIR MEDICAL RESPONSE NEEDS. AND THEN OF COURSE- IN A SECOND NEXT PANEL YOU'RE WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS LOGISTICS AND COMMODITY MOVEMENT IT'S BEEN A MASSIVE EFFORT- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION I THINK I'M- JUST IN THE LPP. MASS CATEGORY ALONE HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED SO FAR. SO IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONAL COORDINATION THE STATE PARTNERS OF ALSO ALIGNED IMPORTANTLY AROUND PUBLIC INFORMATION AND PUBLIC EDUCATION SO THAT WE HAVE REALLY A ONE STOP SHOP. FOR THE PUBLIC FOR DECISION MAKERS- AND ALL IT EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN TO SEE THAT YOUR DASHBOARDS AND DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT CASE RATES SO THAT- SO THAT THAT. IS IT IS IN A COHESIVE AND COORDINATED- YOU KNOW ONE PLACE FOR- FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN AND YOU KNOW JUST A- JUST A TREMENDOUS EFFORT ACROSS STATE FAMILIES NOT IT NOT UNLIKE WHAT WE DO WITH OTHER TYPES OF DISASTERS WHERE WE HAVE REALLY ONE VOICE TO THE PUBLIC. AND EVERYBODY'S ON AT UC COLLATING THEIR INFORMATION TOGETHER AND PRESENTING IT IN A UNIFIED FRONT. WERE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PART JUST LIKE IN RECOVERY FROM OTHER DISASTERS WE THINK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE-FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY. NOT ONLY TO GET FEDERAL RESOURCES FOR RESPONSE BUT ALSO ON THE FINANCIAL PIECE SO- CALLAWAY AS AS AS IT HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A STRONG ROLE IN. WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LEVERAGING THOSE PROGRAMS- IT TO THE EXTENT-POSSIBLE WE'VE DONE THAT WITH THE FEMA PROGRAMS IN WAYS WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. AND COLLUDING SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER FOR FEEDING AND HOUSING AND- YOU KNOW ALWAYS CONSTANTLY WORKING THROUGH TO SEE- BUT WE CAN- EMPLOY IN TERMS OF THE BRINGING IN THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIA THROUGH FEET FOR FEMA. AND THEN IN THE MIDST OF COVERED- AS WAS AS IT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA WE MANAGED A HISTORIC FIRE SEASON. THAT IS NOT OVER YET SO FAR JUST TO DATE FOR OVER FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNED- TRAGICALLY DIED NEARING TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES DESTROYED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY SEVEN. OVER FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES UNDER A FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION FOR WILDFIRE SO WHILE WE'RE CORD CONTINUING TO COORDINATE THE CO OF IN RESPONSE. YEAH I EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED THE WE ARE ALSO MANAGING THE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY FOR THESE WILDFIRES AND ARE ACTIVELY WORKING NOW ON. HELPING THOSE COMMUNITIES- START THE JOURNEY TO RECOVERY- RAPIDLY SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THEY ARE- YOU KNOW GETTING BACK. ON THEIR FEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE INCLUDING DEBRIS OPERATIONS ARE LOOKING OUT FOR WATERSHED IMPACTS FROM THESE FIRES AND HOW WE MIGHT RESPOND TO THOSE AS WELL AS EMERGENCY HOUSING RELATED TO THE WILDFIRES. SO ALL OF THAT'S HAPPENING AND IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER- BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING CASES RISE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO- WE HAVE THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE WE DEVELOP TO A LOT OF THINGS IN THE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS PANDEMIC IN THE MONTHS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE LEVERAGING THOSE SAME TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN QUICKLY MOBILIZE. ANTICIPATE WHAT THE NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE AND RESPOND TO EMERGENCY NEEDS GOING FORWARD. THE LATEST EFFORT WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS IN A LITTLE BIT IS VACCINE PLANNING AND AS I MENTIONED WE'RE GOING TO- YOU KNOW HAVE THAT EFFORT FILLED IN WITH THE OVERALL STATE RESPONSE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE WITH LEVERAGING OUR STATE RESOURCES TO. EFFECTIVELY PLAN FOR AND CARRY THAT OUT THAT IMPORTANT CRITICAL MISSION FOR CALIFORNIA. EVERY DISASTER PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND ADJUST AND WE'RE DOING THAT IN REAL TIME IN THIS IN THIS EVENT. AND CONTINUE TO APPROVE IMPROVE FOR WHAT COMES NEXT. WILL REMAIN VIGILANT AND RESPONSIVE IMPORTANTLY OUR STATE AGENCIES WILL REMAIN A COHESIVE ORGANIZATION TO CONTINUE SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER. AND OUR HEALTH CARE AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND OF COURSE OUR- CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES WHO CONTENDED WITH SO MUCH ALREADY IN TWENTY TWENTY. SO I'LL STOP THERE ON THE ON THE OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS I KNOW THAT WE'R GONNA. TALK ABOUT VACCINE PLANNING AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END AND ALSO COMMENT ON CALABASAS. ROLE IN THAT VACCINE PLANNING. THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE ONLY. IF YOU COULD. SHE'S ON THE PHONE YEAH SHE COULD JUST START TALKING I THINK IT SHOULD GO TO. CHIEF TO BE DIRECTED PEOPLE TO START TALKING IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE THAT'S FINE. THE LINE OF CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR HAS DROPPED FROM THE CALL WE ARE WAITING ON A CALL BACK. ONE ONE AFTER QUESTIONS. WE'RE WAITING FOR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ELLIE WHY DON'T WE USE THE TIME FOR SOME QUESTIONS. THE MYSTERY HAVE QUESTIONS WAS STRICTER THAN MR BLOOD. RESTAURANT. ALL BEGIN WITH CODE THE GENERAL QUESTION DIRECTED THE PANELISTS. IS ANYONE DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT DURING STATE FEDERAL EMERGENCIES EVERY CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT IS ACTING NOT POLITICALLY BUT TO THE NEEDS OF EACH AND EVERY CALIFORNIA THAT A FAIR STATEMENT. TELL. I'LL TAKE THE SILENCE THAT EVERYONE'S IN AGREEMENT. I WANT TO DIG INTO. I GUESS COMMITTEE EQUITY. OF THE FEDERAL- CARES ACT FUNDING HOW THAT'S BEEN DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE CAN ANYONE ON THE PANEL. TELL ME WITH CERTAINTY- HOW MUCH MONEY ACROSS ALL THESE DIFFERENT PARTS HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO EACH COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE. IS THAT IS THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE. ALL ASK THE L. A. L. TO THE INFORMATION FOLKS. S. THANK YOU AND MISTER GRAY WE- DO NOT HAVE THAT DATA IN FRONT OF US I THINK THERE'S SOME SORT OF SPECIFIC POTS OF MONEY WITHIN THAT TOTAL YOU KNOW HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR UNIVERSE THAT COULD BE EXAMINED IN THAT WAY BUT WE DON'T HAVE FIGURES FOR EVERY SINGLE COMPONENT OF IT. SO COULD WE IT WILL BE THE TIME FRAME TO GET A BREAK DOWN TO MY OFFICE OR IN FRONT OF THE MEMBERS IS COMMITTEE. ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS. TOTAL. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEIR STOCK ON THAT- FOR SOME OF THE FIGURES IT COULD BE RELATIVELY QUICKLY PROBABLY ALREADY HOT NUMBERS- AND BUT FOR OTHER PIECES OF THE PIE IT MAY BE- MUCH MORE TIME CONSUMING OR IN FCT IS NOT AVAILABLE WHAT APPRECIATE LEAST TAKING THE WHAT IS AVAILABLE TELLING IT UP ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS AND GET THAT INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE- AND- TO THE MEMBERS HERE TODAY- HOW MUCH MONEY WAS DIRECTLY ALLOCATED TO CITIES AND COUNTIES ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE CARE SECTOR. ALL SPECIFICALLY ASSET OF THE OHIO. FINANCE I THINK THEY PROBABLY HAVE THE FIGURES IN FRONT OF THEM. GOOD MORNING AT CHRISTEN CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE POPULATIONS ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR FIVE HUNDRED. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION RECEIVED- FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL. OKAY AND HOW MUCH MONEY WAS. DIRECTED TO THE STATE FOR AS KIND OF A PASTOR ALLOCATION TO STATE NEEDS. THE STATE RECEIVED NINE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT AMOUNT WE PASSED THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT WERE BELOW THE POPULATION THRESHOLD. SET BY THE US TREASURY SO IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY THE TWENTY TWO JURISDICTIONS IN THIS STATE CITIES AND COUNTIES ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND RECEIVE SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ALMOST SIX BILLION DOLLARS. THE STATE RECEIVED ALMOST TEN BILLION AND I'VE THAT PASSED AROUND TWO BILLION TO SMALLER TOWNS AND CITIES IS THAT. REASONABLY ACCURATE. AT THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY BETTER CERTAINLY ONE COMPONENT OF THE PASTORS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE ALSO DIRECTED AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO DATE TO CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS- WHICH IS A VERY HIGH RISK POPULATION IN RELATIONSHIP TO PREVENT AND WE HAVE FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY. SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE FUNDS WENT TO JURISDICTIONS OF A LOCAL LEVEL. OKAY BUT- IT WOULD BE FAIR TO POINT OUT THAT. SMALLER JURISDICTIONS GOT A PORTION OF THE NIGHT AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. ALONG WITH WHATEVER PORTIONS THAT MONEY WENT TO STATEWIDE INTERESTS. WILD LARGER JURISDICTIONS GOT THAT SAME BENEFIT FROM NINE HALF BILLION AND ADDITIONALLY AN ADDITIONAL SIX OR FIVE POINT SIX OR FIVE POINT EIGHT I CAN CALL THE NUMBER YOU CITED ON IT CERTAINLY AT FIRST BLUSH WOULD STRIKE THIS MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE. THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY ACTED WE DISTRIBUTE THIS MONEY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT PERHAPS SOME RURAL JURISDICTIONS WERE IN THE POSITION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS OR CERTAINLY AT THE- DISCRETION OF WHETHER NOT THE STATE WAS GOING TO PASS FUNDS DOWN THROUGH THEM- IF THEY ASKED FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN THINGS WHILE. LARGER JURISDICTIONS. WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR OWN FUNDING. THAT IS ANY PART OF WHAT I JUST SAID AND UNFAIR STATEMENT. D. B. DISTRIBUTION FAR LOCAL ENTITIES WAS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND WE FEEL THAT IT IS A VERY EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION BASED ON THE CONCENTRATION OF PUBLIC PLACES. IN OUR LARGEST POPULATION CENTERS. THAT WAS BASED ON THE DATA AT THAT TIME INTERESTING SO. TO FINANCE THIS ADMINISTRATION USE ANY EQUITY METRICS TO TARGET THOSE FUNDS TO AREAS OF THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE THAT HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF UNEMPLOYED OR PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY. THAT WOULD NOT BE ALLOCATION FORMULA THAT WAS AGREED UPON WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER AREAS OF FUNDING THAT CAN HELP AND KIND OF ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE HIGH NEED. AND WE DID SO IN SOME OF THE CDC FUNDING THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH STATISTICS. M. PURSUANT TO THE- FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WAS AVAILABLE. ONE LET ME DRILL DOWN FURTHER DID WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN ANY OF OUR METRICS THE DEGREE TO WHICH A WORK% FORCE IN ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION IS CONSIDERED. ESSENTIAL SUCH AS- IN MY DISTRICT- MY COLLEAGUE CECILY ARE ENCOURAGED DISTRICT WE HAVE A LOT OF AGRICULTURIST BY DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER AGRICULTURE WORKERS WHO HAD TO CONTINUE TO FEED THE STATE DURING THIS. ACADEMIC THIS EPIDEMIC AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE MISTER RANDALL FROM FRESNO APPRECIATES THAT ASPECT OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE TOO AND I'LL TELL YOU. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE REPRESENTING A ROLLER COASTER COMMUNITY I'VE HAD SOME COLLEAGUES. IN THIS INSTITUTION WHO HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO PONTIFICATE. AND BE ACCUSATORY. AND YET THEY DIDN'T SEND ANY OTHER P. P. FROM SAN DIEGO THEY DIDN'T SEND ANY THEIR MONEY FROM SAID. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE I REALLY FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IN RETROSPECT THAT WE MAKE SURE GOING FORWARD IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE. NOT THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENT WILL THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS OR THE ADMINISTRATION- PAST MONEY DOWN TO THEM BUT RATHER HAVE SOME MONEY TO DEAL AND ADDRESS SERIOUS ISSUES HAPPENING AT HOME BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WE GET A PASTOR SITUATIONS THERE ARE DELAYS THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS THERE IS BUREAUCRACY. AND HOPEFULLY WHEN ELLIE- GETS US SOME INFORMATION ON OR AT LEAST THE BEST INFORMATION WE HAVE OF HOW EQUITABLE THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN. WE CAN DEVELOP AUTOMATION SOME METRICS GOING FORWARD THEY WOULD MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TREATED. FAIRLY AS FUNDING GOES BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW NOT BEING PREPARED GOING INTO DISASTERS WHEN- WE'RE MAKING IT UP AS WE GO AND- THAT'SWHEN POLITICS% INSERTS ITS UGLY HEAD INTO POLICY AND WE END UP WITH. THE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE TO HAVE THE LARGEST POLITICAL POWER- GETTING THE LION'S SHARE THE RESOURCES ALL LIVE. IN MY TIME THAT THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT MEMBER. THANKS MISTER MONTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND. THERE HAS BEEN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS A LOT OF FRUSTRATION THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE LACK OF LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT IN DECIDING HOW THESE OF FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED AND- IN PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE. M. A. R. I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY CLEAR WHEN WE PASSED SB EIGHTY NINE A FEW MONTHS AGO. THE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY THAT WE WERE GIVING TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THERE WERE CERTAIN KINDS OF IS THE SPENDING AUTHORITY THAT WE RECOGNIZE LEGISLATIVE PRINT THE THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF RESPONSE FUNDING THAT WE WANTED TO BE A PART OF IT UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS REALLY NOT GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE THAT ROLE I MEAN WE'VE GOT A REPORTING REQUIREMENT. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS BEEN REPORTING THE LEGISLATURE WHEN SPENDING DECISIONS ARE MADE BUT NOT INVOLVING THE LEGISLATURE IN MAKING THOSE SPENDING DECISIONS SO THE L. A. ALWAYS LAID OUT SOME PRETTY STARK. OPTIONS FOR US WE COULD- WE COULD PASS A RESOLUTION TO END THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY THAT WOULD BE ONE THING WE COULD DO PRETTY DRACONIAN- WE COULD CHANGE STATE LAW TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE FUTURE EMERGENCY- BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. THE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW AND SO MY QUESTION FOR THE DELAY OFFICE DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE SO FRUSTRATED ABOUT THIS AND WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO BE MORE OF A PARTNER WITH YOU. IN MAKING SPENDING DECISIONS. ACTRESS HEATHER OR DEPARTMENT FINANCE AGAIN. AND WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING AND PROVIDING NOTIFICATION LETTERS AS NOTED CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW WE'VE ALSO BEEN PROVIDING FISCAL UPDATES- AS FAR BACK AS WHEN CONTROL SECTIONS OF. THIS WAS IN PLACE AND BEEN TRYING TO AGAIN PROVIDE AS- THE TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION BOTH FOR THE STATE EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL. IT AT. FUNDING UPDATES ARE PROVIDED IN SEPTEMBER- IN ADDITION WE CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON ONE OF OUR- CATEGORIES IN OUR LATEST FISCAL UPDATE HAS YOU KNOW I. TEETH DEEP ON THEIR ONLINE RELATED TO THE VACCINE TASK FORCE IS KIND OF. ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT IS PENDING THAT WE'RE NOT AT THE TO HAVE A FISCAL ESTIMATE ON BUT THAT WE WANT TO SIGNAL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND NOTING THAT THAT THAT IS BEING CONTEMPLATED AND CONSIDERED. SO AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PROVIDE D. THESE UPDATES AS WE HAVE THEM ON FISCAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC OKAY THANK YOU OF THAT I MEAN YOUR ANSWER ILLUSTRATES THE- THE PROBLEM OKAY BECAUSE- WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT. YOU HAVE BEEN DOING YOUR BEST TO TELL US WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DECIDED AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS OF DECIDING HOW TO RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY HOW TO DISTRIBUTE THIS FUNDING. AND I THOUGHT THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY CLEAR WHEN WE PASSED SB EIGHTY NINE IN ARTICULATING THE FACT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE INVOLVED SO ARE OF IT DID YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING THAT YOU'RE SAYING WE MAKE THE DECISIONS AND THEN WE TELL YOU WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE INVOLVED IN THOSE DECISIONS. BECAUSE WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL- A CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO NOT ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE SPENDING BUT IT. TO PERFORM OVERSIGHT OF THAT SPENDING. NO YES I AM I. HERE AND APPRECIATE THE CONCERN AND WE WILL AND WE WILL DEFINITELY MAKE NOTE AND- CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION WHICH I THINK. IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE DISCUSSIONS WE ARE HAVING IN THE SPRING TO AND WANTED TO ADD THE ADDITIONAL REPORTING THAT WE'VE BEEN. PROVIDING WITH THAT AT THE RESULT OF THOSE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS- AGAIN MARCH OF MORE TRANSPARENCY AND I'M MORE INFORMATION BEING PROVIDED OKAY WELL THANK YOU I MEAN I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE INTROSPECTIVE ABOUT BECAUSE- THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST TIME THAT WE HAVE. THE KIND OF EMERGENCY THAT REQUIRES THIS KIND OF SHARED OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK WE NEED TO WORK THESE KINKS OUT SO THEY WERE BETTER PREPARED NEXT TIME. BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATED ABOUT. ABOUT OUR LACK OF IN OF INVOLVEMENT IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS AND- AND REALLY FEELING LIKE- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO BE INVOLVED IN AND THEN THE KIND OF A SIMILAR QUESTION FOR THE- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE IF WE COULD GET MISS PETERS BACK ON- YOU OUTLINED SOME PRETTY- SOME PRETTY STARK. PATHS FOR US IS A LEGISLATORS THAT WE COULD TAKE TO TRY TO VOTE ENGAGE MORE IN THIS PROCESS- BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY ENDING THE DECLARATION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS REPERCUSSIONS BEYOND JUST THE- LEGISLATURES ENGAGEMENT AND- IN SPENDING AUTHORITY SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE ISN'T SOME KIND OF MIDDLE GROUND OBVIOUSLY CHANGING STATE LAW WOULD APPLY TO FUTURE EMERGENCIES NOT TO THIS ONE AND WOULD REQUIRE YOU KNOW THE CONCURRENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH- WOULD WHEN WE DO THAT SO ARE WONDERING IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT. THE L. A. O. HAS A HAS MAYBE THOUGHT OF. THAT WE COULD FIX THIS PROCESS AND MORE INVOLVED THE LEGISLATURE IN THOSE SPENDING DECISIONS. THANK YOU MR OBERNOLTE ADDRESS COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- SO JUST TO BE CLEAR WE WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE- USE ITS AUTHORITY TO AND THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION. I'M JUST SORT OF NOTING HOW THE STATE'S EMERGENCY LAWS WORK- OBVIOUSLY AS YOU POINT OUT THAT WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT REPERCUSSIONS pABLE TO RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AT AL. AND WE WERE ASKED TO SPEAK TO POTENTIAL LONGER TERM CHANGES- AND I THINK I'M GETTING AT SOME OF THE OVERSIGHT ISSUES AND QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE RAISED. IT'S REALLY THAT MIDDLE GROUND AREA- I'M FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT AT THIS POINT AND THE MINISTRATION HAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING MONTHLY REPORTING. THIS INFORMATION AND YOU JUST IT'S JUST LIKE A REPORT BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY VERY CRITICAL FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING. I'M IT REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE LEVELS AND THE TOTAL BUDGETARY IMPACTS AND- OF WHAT IS BEING- HAS BEEN DONE AND IT ALSO IS SHOWING THOSE PLANNED ACTIVITIES IN THE FUTURE. I AM GETTING THIS INFORMATION UPDATED ONLY PERIODICALLY REALLY IS LIMITING THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERSIGHT OF THIS RESPONSE TIME. AND ENSURING THAT THOSE REPORTS SHOW BOTH WHAT HAS BEEN EXPENDED ALREADY. THE WELL AS WHAT IS PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE I'M IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF INFORMATION THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE ABLE. TO ENGAGE MEANINGFULLY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH OVERSIGHT HEARINGS OR OTHER- AVENUES THAT YOU HAVE THAT WITHOUT HAVING THAT INFORMATION OF WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT AND WHAT THEY PLAN TO SPEND. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE BASE INFORMATION THAT- IS REALLY NECESSARY FOR- REALLY STRONG LEGISLATIVE ENGAGEMENT HI I'M IN THIS PROCESS IN A IN A REALLY IMPACTFUL MEANINGFUL CONSISTENT WAY. AND SO AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE RAISE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THESE ARE PER ON A MONTH BASIS. AND THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET YOU KNOW THEY'RE WORKING TOWARDS IT AND IT'S COMPLICATED BUT- I'M IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THIS- AND WATER THOSE CHALLENGES AND WHAT STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN. TO OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES ARE BECAUSE JUST HAVING THAT THAT BASELINE OF INFORMATION IS REALLY THE FIRST I'M NECESSARY STOP. I'M IN OVERSIGHT AND ENSURING THAT IT SHOWS WHAT THEY SPENT AND WHAT WHAT ARE SOME THE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. I JUST UNDERSTANDING THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW FOR A LOT MORE AND MEANINGFUL INVOLVEMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. I'M IN TERMS OF SECTION THIRTY SIX THAT YOU BROUGHT UP ON AND SORT OF ADVANCE NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE FUNDING IS CONSTRUCTED ON IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD THINK ABOUT GOING FORWARD. I'M EITHER CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF EMERGENCY SPENDING OVERALL OR CHANGING IT FOR JUST THIS PARTICULAR EMERGENCY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY AND I WOULD URGE EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE. TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT WHAT CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE TO IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH BECAUSE WE HAVE A- AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION TO FILL. THIS EMERGENCY IS NOT GOING TO BE OVER ANY TIME SOON AS YOU POINTED OUT THE TREE AUTHORITY IS GOING TO LAST UNTIL. NEXT JULY FIRST SO THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS AND- AS WE KNOW THE STATE'S GONNA REQUIRE LONGER TO RECOVER. THAN THAT- AND I REALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE A VALUABLE ROLE TO FULFIL HERE I MEAN WE'RE- IF IT'S NOT A ANOTHER GIVEN OVER WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY AND THE POWER TO SPEND MONEY- IT'S MORE OF A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HELP THE STATE RECOVER AND WEAR THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND WE'RE THE ONES WITH THE- CONNECTIONS INTO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE IN THE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS. THAT'S OUR FUNCTION AS REPRESENTATIVES AND I THINK THAT- WE'RE WE BETTER ENGAGED HERE WE DO WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB IN HELPING. SOMEONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CANDIDATE ANSWER THE QUESTION. CURTIS FAULCONER VICE. ON QUESTIONS OF COULD. MISS CALVERT- COMISKEY OF WHATEVER THE QUESTION IS WHY. DLF HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE THE MONTHLY REPORTS AND- IF SO WHEN THOSE MONTHLY REPORTS FOR. CURRENT. HI WE HAVE AN AS NOTED WE OBSERVE A AN AUGUST UP. YOU PROVIDED THIS NO UP WITH. WE ALSO A SHIFT UPDATE RELATED TO FUNDING SO WE DID NOT HAVE AN OCTOBER UPDATE AND THEN YES WE ARE OUR INTENT IS STILL TO PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES ON OUR EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES WE HAVE- SHIFTED THE WAY WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT OR CONTINUE TO TRY TO IMPROVE THAT APPROACH AND GATHER THE INFORMATION. AND RELAY FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES NOT ONLY IS IT THAT THE STATE BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES BUT- WORKING WITH OUR- OUR PUBLIC THAT YES ON. AND FEMA REIMBURSEMENTS AND MAXIMIZING THE ALLOWABLE FEMA REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS THE REPORTING ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIOUS FEDERAL FUNDS AND CRF MOST NOTABLY SO HOW CAN THIS INFORMATION IS- SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND REFINING. BUT AND JUST WANT TO POINT OUT WE DID PROVIDE AN AUGUST UPDATE AND WE PROVIDED THE SEPTEMBER UPDATE ON THE FEDERAL FUNDING SIDE- AND AGAIN ON NOVEMBER FISCAL UPDATE. WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION WE HAVE. SO LET ME JUST ASK MISTER STERN DURING CAN. CAN YOU SORT OF. THIS DISCUSS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE HAS IMPROVED. DURING THE TIME OF THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO- REITERATE SORT OF WHERE THE WHERE THE GAPS STILL REMAIN MISS PETERS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M SO I THINK AND THE INITIATION IS PROVIDING REPORTS AND THAT THEN MEAN WINDS IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE STATE'S- OVERALL DIRECT FINDING. HAVE COME INTO MAY AND AUGUST AND NOVEMBER THERE WAS- AN INTERIM SEPTEMBER- UPDATE PROVIDED THAT FOCUS JUST ON THE FEDERAL FINES. AND N. B. WHEN YOU PUT ALL THESE REPORTS TOGETHER IT CAN SHOW A HELPFUL PICTURE OF SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OVERALL SPENDING AND THE STATE'S RESPONSE. I'M ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT'S HAPPENING IS EACH TIME THESE UPDATES CALM AND THE OVERALL DOLLAR NOW AND ACTIVITIES ARE CHANGING AND THE IN SOME CASES BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND SO THINGS ARE OBVIOUSLY INVOLVING RICK VERY RAPIDLY AND AS- WE LEARN MORE ABOUT ON KOBE NINETEEN AND THE INITIATION OF FURTHER DEVELOPS ITS PLANS TO RESPOND. AND THAT WHEN THINGS CHANGED SO SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YOU KNOW ONE UPDATE TO THE NEXT. AND THAT SORT OF POINTS TO THE LEGISLATURE NEEDING MORE FREQUENT UPDATES AND MORE TIMELY INFORMATION AND THE OTHER THING IS IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. I'M IN THESE UPDATES IT'S COMBINING FUNDING FROM LAST FISCAL YEAR WITH PLANNED FUNDING FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THESE DOLLARS AND SPENT HOW REMAINS. I'M WHAT DOES ASK HIM IT'S HARD TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND THEN HOW DOES THAT TIE TO DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AND A LOT OF FINDINGS BEEN SPENT ON PROCUREMENT OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHICH OF TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT PANEL. BUT HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPENT AND WHAT WAS PURCHASED FOR THAT AND- HOW MUCH REMAINS AVAILABLE THOSE TYPES OF QUESTIONS IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR FROM THOSE UPDATES- AND SO GETTING FATTER INFORMATION AND HAVE FREQUENT ENOUGH MANNERS CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SYSTEMS PETERS IS IT FAIR TO SAY JUST WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU AS- YOU WANT A CERTAIN CONSISTENCY WITH THE REPORT SO THAT. YOU CAN COMPARE MONTH TO MONTH AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS LIKE THE DATA JOHN. A BIT OF ALL OF THE PLACE SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO. COMPARE WHAT ACTUALLY WAS EXPENDED SAY BETWEEN AUGUST AND NOVEMBER. YEAH IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT AMOUNT HAS BEEN EXPANDED VERSES WHAT PORTION OF THE TOTAL REFLECTS PLANNED EXPENDITURES TO GET THROUGH THE REST OF THE FISCAL YEAR SO THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IF WE SPENT WHAT DID THAT GET US WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED. COMING FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION AND YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE IN THESE VERSIGHT HEARING SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO DO FOR THE REST OF THE FISCAL YEAR WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES AND HAVE A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION OF THEM. INSTEAD OF NOT HAVING THAT BASIC INFORMATION. THANK YOU MISS PERU SYSTEM IS COVERED THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE. THAT WE HAVE- REPORTING THAT. IS CONSISTENT. FROM ONE MONTH TO THE NEXT TO THAT WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SPENT. IN THE INTERIM PERIODS AS WELL AS- WHAT IS- PROJECTED WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM DAILY HOURS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DISSECT THAT DATA IN ITS CURRENT FORMAT. YEAH I KNOW WHAT WE PROVIDE IS A PRETTY HIGH LEVEL WE REALLY TRIED TO SHOW THAT TYPE OF COMPARISON WE TRY TO SHOW YOU KNOW SINCE OUR LAST UPDATE ON THESE TYPES OF EXPENDITURES FROM AUGUST TO NOVEMBER. I'M KIND OF A SIDE BY SIDE OF WHAT THOSE ARE NOW I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE INTERIM THERE ARE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER UPDATES PROVIDED SO- ONE OF OUR MAIN DIFFERENCES. IN AUGUST TO NOVEMBER WAS THE INCLUSION OF AND THAT THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING BUT THERE WAS AN INTERIM UPDATE IN LATE AUGUST SENT- AT ON ON THIS MATTER SO IT'S NOT THAT AND DISCUSSIONS REN'T HAPPENING AND INFORMATION ISN'T BEING PROVIDED UNTIL THESE FISCAL UPDATES ARE PROVIDED THERE ARE- NOTICES BEING SENT. AND INFORMATION BEING PROVIDED IN THE INTERNET AS WELL RIGHT BIRTH PEOPLE WERE SAYING DISCOVERED IS. DATA IS BEING DUMPED. BUT AS AS YOU MENTIONED MAYBE IT'S- TO HIGH LEVEL NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH. IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT TO DISCERN. SO I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I MEAN WE COULD GIVE ANYBODY. YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS BUT FRANKLY IT DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY SYNTHESIZE IT AND CAN COMPARE- INFORMATION. SO IF YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE- HERE WE ARE WE HAVE A PROBLEM AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSITY. CALIFORNIA JUST GIVE EXAMPLE EVERY YEAR. THEY WERE PASS A BUDGET. BUT THEY NEVER. ENTERED THE REGENTS WHAT THE ACTUALLY SPEND MONEY ON TO EVERY YEAR THEY GO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WAS THIS AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WITH THIS BUT NO ONE EVER TOLD THEM WHAT. WHAT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SPENT. SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE- SAYING TO YOU IS- IN YOUR MIND YOU'RE GIVING US INFORMATION. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IT'S HARD TO COMMUNICATE IS THAT THE INFORMATION IN THE FORMAT IS PRESENTED MAY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR MEETING YOUR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T FOR FILL THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE DEMOCRATIC IN THE OPEN THIS OBLIGATION THAT WE HAVE AN OPEN SOCIETY. SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ASK IF YOU CAN WORK WITH THE L. A. O. TO. GET THE REPORT FORMAT THAT- IS A LITTLE MORE LOW LEVEL A LITTLE MORE INFORMATIVE IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS- MORE EASILY DIGESTIBLE. BECAUSE JUST AS AS I'M ON THE RECEIVING END OF THESE LETTERS THERE'S JUST SORT OF LIKE. DOES SHE JUST- IT'S JUST PAPER JUST COMING THROUGH THE DESK IT DOESN'T REALLY. MEANS THAT MUCH FROM AN OVERALL PICTURE. SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND WHAT WE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IN THE SPRING WE WERE STILL STRUGGLING JUST TO CONTAIN THINGS NOW THAT AT LEAST HAS THE STATE HAS HAD SOME SUCCESSES WOULD HAVE MANAGING AS BEST AS WE COULD THE PANDEMIC. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE TAKEN A LOOK BACK AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT WAS SPENT AND THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT WE PLAN ON SPENDING MOVING FORWARD. YEAH I KNOW WHERE I AM. ALWAYS ALWAYS HAPPY TO KEEP TALKING THE WITH THE L. A. L. WE HAVE I JUST I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT WE HAVE INVOLVED IN THE REPORTING SO WE DO HAVE- MORE. MORE LINES AND MORE SPECIFICITY THAN WHEN WE STARTED SO WE ALSO CONTINUE TO REFINE HOW WE PRESENT IT TO MAKE IT. AS USEFUL AS POSSIBLE AND FIND THAT BALANCE OF LIKE YOU SAID BE DIGESTIBLE- BUT ALSO HAVING THE INFORMATION THE FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR SO. AND WE'LL CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION DON'T CONTINUE- AS WE WORK ON IT HURT TO REFINE THAT FORMAT AND SEE WHAT. IS THAT AT A HELPFUL WAY TO COMMUNICATE THAT INFORMATION AND THEN IF IT IF YOU FOR THAT AGAIN. I MEAN WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT THESE CHANGES BE COMMUNICATED BETWEEN FINANCE AND L. A. ALL IN. THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE. IT OVERSIGHT HEARING I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF OUR FRUSTRATION IT FEELS LIKE- THINGS DON'T GET. TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY UNTIL WE START SCHEDULING OVERSIGHT HEARING SO. OUR PREFERENCES- YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE YOUR JOB. WE HAVE OUR JOB WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE FEEDBACK AND I THINK WE'RE ALL. RUN THE SAME TEAM WE WILL WE'RE ALL WORKING TO. MANAGE THIS PANDEMIC WE'RE ALL WORKING TO TRY TO SAVE LIVES- YOU KNOW ALL ACROSS THE STATE WORLD WE ALL HAVE EXACTLY. THE SAME GOAL THERE'S NO THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE IN GOALS I THINK WE ARE. JUST TRYING TO AGAIN DO DO OUR JOB JUST LIKE YOU ARE. SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU COULD. YOU COULD YOU COULD HELP US IF WE CAN HELP YOU IN THE- THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT WE NEED TO. I THINK WORK BETTER TOGETHER ON THIS- ON. HOW. WE ARE COMMUNICATING ON THIS PARTICULAR SHIP. SO DO WE HAVE MISTER DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FOR NOW. THAT THAT THE DOCTOR FINALLY. HE ASKED- THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU CAN GO AHEAD OF THEM WILL GO TO MISTER COOPER AFTER. GO AHEAD OF THE GREAT. OKAY GOOD MORNING TEARS A MEMBERS I'M SEASON FINALE GAP CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN THE STATE'S WORK IN PREPARING FOR PUBLIC VACCINE I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON OUR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLANNING. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC DATA AND SCIENCE HAVE GUIDED THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN WELL THERE IS NO FDA APPROVED VACCINE YET CALIFORNIA'S PLANNING PROCESS FOR THE EVENTUAL DISTRIBUTION AND MINISTRATION OF COVER NINETEEN VACCINATION IS GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES. ENSURING PREVENT NINETEEN VACCINE MEET SAFETY REQUIREMENTS ENSURING THAT THE VACCINE IS DISTRIBUTED AND ADMINISTERED EQUITABLY. AND ENSURING TRANSPARENCY BY BRINGING AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE OUTSET. TO VERIFY THE SAFETY OF THE COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE GOVERNOR NEWSOM RECENTLY NAMED A SCIENTIFIC REVIEW WORKGROUP COMPRISED OF NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED IMMUNIZATION PUBLIC HEALTH ACADEMIC AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FROM CALIFORNIA. SHORTLY FOLLOWING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WASHINGTON OREGON AND NEVADA JOINED OUR EFFORT WITH EACH STATE GOVERNOR I'M NAMING ADDITIONAL EXPERTS TO THIS WORKGROUP. WORKGROUP IS CHARGED WITH STAYING ABREAST OF VACCINE TRIALS EVIDENCE OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY AND OTHER INFORMATION TO INDEPENDENTLY PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE AND OUR VACCINE PLANNING EFFORTS AS WELL AS ENSURE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN VACCINE SAFETY ADVOCACY AND IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM ALSO ANNOUNCED TWO ADDITIONALKEY GROUPS TO ENSURE THE VACCINE IS DISTRIBUTED AND MINISTERED EQUITABLY. I DRAFTING GUIDELINES WORK GROUP COMPRISED OF IMMUNIZATION PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTHCARE AND ACADEMIC EXPERTS AND ETHICISTS CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR THE PRIORITIZATION AND ALLOCATION OF VACCINE WHEN SUPPLIES ARE LIMITED SO THAT INITIAL FACE. AN UPCOMING COMMUNITY ADVISORY VACCINE COMMITTEE THIS COMMITTEE WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE NOT YET BEEN NAMED WILL PROVIDE INPUT AND FEEDBACK TO THE PLANNING EFFORTS. AND THIS IS A DECISION MAKING FROM A BROAD ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS. WE CONTINUE TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO PREPARE FOR THE EVENTUAL DISTRIBUTION MINISTRATION OF THE VACCINE IN CALIFORNIA. PLANNING WILL INVOLVE CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND WILL LEVERAGE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A ROUTINE VACCINATION. CALIFORNIA'S COBA NINETEEN VACCINATION PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEVERAL PHASES- PRE VACCINE LIMIT DOES AVAILABLE- LARGER NUMBER OF DOSES ARE AVAILABLE IN THE-SECOND PHASE AND THEN. SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF A OF DOSES FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION. CALIFORNIA'S VACCINATION COMMUNICATION PLAN IS FOCUSED ON ENSURING EVERYONE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE TIMELY ACCURATE AND THE ACTUAL ACTIONABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE VACCINATION. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT VACCINATION FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY. WILL BE TRANSPARENT OUR COMMUNICATION AND FOCUS ON- FOR SAFETY AND EQUITIES AND WE WILL FOCUS ON THE ROLE AS A FAX EMAIL PLAN BRINGING AN END TO THE PANDEMIC. OUR COMMUNICATION EFFORTS WILL ALIGN WITH THE COVERT VACCINE DISTRIBUTION TIMELINE AND WE WILL BE M. AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN FOUR PHASES PRE VACCINE LIMITED DOSES AVAILABLE PHASE ONE LARGE NUMBER OF DOSES AVAILABLE FACE TO YOU AND SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF DOSES FOR THE ENTIRE OPULATION WHICH WOULD BE. A PHASE THREE COMMUNICATIONS PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION WILL ALSO ALIGN WITH THE STATE'S HEALTH EQUITY METRIC WHICH HELPS GUIDE CALIFORNIA'S COUNTY COUNTIES IN THEIR CONTINUING EFFORTS. TO MOVE MORE EFFECTIVELY FIGHT OVER NINETEEN THE EQUITY METRIC IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE CASES ON THE OST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED BY THE CENSUS TRACTS IN THE LOWEST QUARTILE OF THE HEALTHY PLACES INDEX- WITH LARGER COUNTIES AS DEFINED BY POPULATION AND GEOGRAPHY. OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN SMALLER COUNTIES- WHERE HAVE A DIFFERENT MEASURE AND AN EQUITY PLAN BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE A MEASURED IN CENSUS TRACTS. CALIFORNIA'S TAX COMMUTER PLANNING INCLUDES INPUT FROM SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS EXPERTS AND CRISIS COMMUNICATION. PUBLIC AFFAIRS IMMUNIZATION AND LEVERAGES HEALTHEQUITY WORK ALREADY UNDERWAY AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE VACCINATION PROGRAM REQUIRE TIMELY ACCESSIBLE AND EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE DEVELOP WIRING IMMUNIZATION TEAM AND HEALTH EDUCATION SPECIALISTS. ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH FEDERAL LOCAL PARTNERS TO CREATE. THE APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE MEDIA AND PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF THIS GUIDANCE THROUGH ALL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF UNKNOWNS ABOUT THE TIMING QUANTITY AND EFFICACY OF THE VACCINE. IN ADDITION THERE ARE SEVERAL VACCINES AT VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. AND TESTING- AND SO KEEPING ON TOP OF THAT AND UNDERSTANDING WHICH OF THE VACCINES WILL- COME OUT FIRST AND WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE. CALIFORNIA WILL LEVERAGE ITS WELL ESTABLISHED EXISTING IMMUNIZATION FRAMEWORK AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS BETWEEN STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL AUTHORITIES. THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT PARTNERS SUCH AS HOSPITAL SYSTEMS HEALTH CLINICS. APPLY IN THE STAGE OF THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLANT. WE'LL BE BUILDING ON LESSONS LEARNED FOR SEASONAL INFLUENZA EFFORTS AS WELL AS THOSE LEARNED DURING H. ONE AND ONE. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE CHANGING QUANTITIES TIME LINES THAT AND AVAILABILITY WHETHER OR NOT SUPPLIES ARE AND TRULY- PROVIDED BY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN COMMUNICATION NEEDS IN TERMS OF- DIFFERENT PHASES AND AVAILABILITY BOTH ON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDE. SEE PAGES IN THE EARLY PROCESS OF RECRUITING AND ROLLING VACCINE PROVIDERS IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OUR LOVE HALTH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ARE IMMUNIZATION COALITIONS AND STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS. WORK IS UNDERWAY TO ENSURE THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. IS ROBUST AND WILL MEET EXTENSIVE AND BRIDGET DATA REQUIREMENTS FROM CDC FOR EXAMPLES- PROVIDERS NEED TO REPORT A MENACE- DOSES WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS INTO THE DATA SYSTEM. SO THE STATE COMMAND REPORT TO CDC AT THIS TIME WE ARE LEVERAGING PURGING CURRENT SYSTEMS AND UPGRADE HARDWARE SERVERS AND REQUIRE. IN THE POSSIBILITY THAT A VACCINE IS AVAILABLE THIS YEAR YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT ANNOUNCED IT COULD BE AVAILABLE AS SOON AS- DECEMBER NINTH. AT THIS TIME- WE ARE WORKING ON AN END TO END SOLUTION THAT WE READY EARLY NEXT YEAR AS A TO ACCOMMODATE THE EXPECTED VOLUME AND DATA TRANSFERS NEEDED I SUPPLY- BECOMES MORE AVAILABLE. I JUST WILL DATA DRIVEN WAY AN EMPHASIS ON AT AND ALL PROTECTING VULNERABLE. WELCOME HEALTH. WILL BOTH MINISTER. AND ALLOCATE DOSES IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS TO OTHER PROVIDERS. ALLOCATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTIES IN ACCORDANCE TO A PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK. THAT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE MADE ADDITIONAL BASED ON GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SEE PAGE ONE CORPORATE NATIONAL PRIORITIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES AND THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE TO GUIDE PRIORITIZATION FOR CALIFORNIA. THE PROCESS FOR ABOUT JUST WANT A FOLLOW THE FEB GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE OUR- OF VACCINE TO EACH STATE. CALIFORNIA WILL BAN ALLOCATE VACCINE BASED ON THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK TO EACH COUNTY. SOME MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS. THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL THEN ALLOCATE TO THEIR PROVIDERS WHO IN TURN WILL PLACE ORDERS IN THE STATE SYSTEM. THE STATE WILL PROVE ORDERS AND SENT TO CDC FOR FILM AT VACCINE WILL BE SHIPPED DIRECT. FROM THE MANNER MANUFACTURERS OR FROM A FEDERAL DISTRIBUTOR TO THE PROVIDERS SO IT'S FROM THE FEDS TO THE PROVIDER THE STATE DOESN'T TAKE POSSESSION OF THE VACCINE. A PROVIDER WILL NEED STATE APPROVAL TO REDISTRIBUTE. THE VACCINE TO ANOTHER SITE. STORAGE ON HAND FRIENDLY ONE OF THESE. WHICH IS THE FIZER ONE REQUIRES. ORDER LOW. COLD CHAIN FREE QUIT AND- TRAINING FOR PROVIDERS. WE ARE WORKING DEVELOP STATEWIDE BACKUP SOLUTIONS FOR THE STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF THIS VACCINE- LARA PLANNING FOR THIS NEED WE ARE ALSO LAST QUARTER. SPINELLI BUT WITH CD WHO WITH A WORKING ON A SLEW FOR THAT HALF OF IF I COULD ASK YOU TO PLEASE WRAP UP. YES YEAH MY MOMMA VERY ON PEACE A SAFER EFFECTIVE NINETY VACCINE IS ONE OF THEM IMPORTANT INTERVENTION TO AND THE CLOVEN P. CALIFORNIA WILL BE CAREFUL ABOVE ALL ADEQUATE IN OUR AND BACKS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU GOING TO THE STRIP CLUB. HISTORY'S LARGEST INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS EVERYONE THOSE FOLKS THAT INDUSTRY IS AN ESSENTIAL WORKER. AND I THINK IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT IT AND THE COUPLE SPENT PER PERSON AND REALLY DRILL DOWN. INTO THE INTO THE COUNTY'S SPECIAL CENTRAL VALLEY YOU CAN SEE A BIG DISCREPANCY SLIDE I'M TOO INTERESTED ABOUT GETTING THAT INFORMATION WHERE THE MONEY CAME FROM- BUT NOW TURNING BACK TO MISS FANELLI. TELL ME HAS THERE BEEN ANY COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AS IT RELATES TO THE VACCINE PLANNING. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY. I'M I AM NOT SURE OF THAT OTHER THAN I'M WORKING ON TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT I THINK WE HAVE SENT TO AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OUR VACCINE PLAN WE POSTED IT ON OUR WEBSITE- OTHER THAN THAT I'LL HAVE TO CHECK WITH THE TEAM TO SEE WHAT OTHER ACTIVITIES HAVE HAPPENED. WITHIN HIS LEGISLATORS WE SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO YOUR WEBSITE TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY SHOULD BE REALLY AVAILABLE TO US- ALSO SURE- ONLY TALKED ABOUT A STAKEHOLDERS- HOW THEY'RE GONNA BE CHILLS OUT- WHAT COMMUNITIES OR GROUPS ARE YOU CONSIDERING CHOOSING. THE STAKEHOLDERS. I THANK ALL THE AND YOU READ READ SOME OFF EARLY THAT IS UNDER. WE CERTAINLY. WE CERTAINLY WANT TO A BROADER ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTED AND FROM A VARIETY OF AREAS AND INCLUDE. YELP IS CERTAINLY WORKERS AS WELL AS AND MANY OF THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU. ALL REPRESENT SO WE WILL- I THINK WE CAN PROVIDE. A LIST OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND CERTAINLY WOULD BE OPEN TO- SUGGESTIONS AND REVIEW THOSE AS WE TRY TO GET. AS REPRESENTATIVE OF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE AS WE CAN SURE I THINK WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU HAS REACHED OUT TO LIVE THAT IS STILL UNDER FORMATION. IF YOU TO REACH OUT TO THE TO THE MEMBERS THE ASSEMBLY BECAUSE WE REPRESENT CALIFORNIANS AND WE HAVE REALLY STRONG COMMUNITY TIES WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS OUT THERE AND ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITY GROUPS. ESPECIALLY THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I'M SURE. MY COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP YOU AND DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN- MY QUESTION IS WHEN WILL THE LEGISLATURE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO REVIEW THE ACTUAL VACCINATION PLAN IN DETAIL. PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND WILL THERE BE ANY OF. LET'S WITH THE TO WORKING GROUP'S AFFECTING WORKING GROUP'S. WORKING THAT. SO WE ARE HAPPY TO SHARE THE IT'S AN INTERIM PLAN SO IT WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND WE'RE OPEN TO YOUR FEEDBACK WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A COPY OF THE PLAN AS IT NOW EXISTS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE LEARN MORE ABOUT. THE VACCINE AVAILABILITY AND EFFICACY EVERY DAY AND SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE CHANGES TO THAT PLAN I THINK THE RUB IS THAT YOU KNOW WE- WE FEEL SHE REACHED OUT TO US TO BE A PARTNER IN THIS. AND NOT YOU KNOW OR VICE VERSA WE WANT TO BE ENGAGE WANT TO BE INVOLVED IT'S IMPORTANT TO US AND WE'RE IN A LOT. OF WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS AFFECTS OUR CONSTITUENTS SO. I WOULD HOPE THAT MAYBE FOR GOING FORWARD YOU CAN REACH OUT TO THE LEGISLATURE ONE ADOLESCENT SOME OF THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE. DEFINITELY GAUGING OF OFFICE. AND WE DO HAVE A COMMUNICATION PLAN. WE DO HAVE A COMMUNICATION PLAN THAT INCLUDES AN EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. AND ALSO A ON LEGISLATIVE OUTREACH GROUP SO. WE WILL BE DOING MORE OF THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AGAIN. OUR PLAN WAS JUST SUBMITTED IN TERMS OF A VERY QUICK TIMELINE. AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT WAS ON THE FIRST DRAFT SURE- SO WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS AS FAR AS WHEN THE PUBLIC WILL BE ADVISED. WHAT ABOUT THE PART OR PIRES IS ATION. OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES. AND HOW ARE YOU HOW DO YOU PLAN ON COMMUNICATING THAT. OUR MEETING. THAT WE DO HAVE A WHOLE COME. PLAN THE- I THINK WE'RE IN THE EARLY. AS WE LEARN MORE. I'M WE WILL AND CERTAINLY WANT TO BE AS TRANSPARENT WE KNOW THAT. WE HAVE TO BUILD TRUST WE HAVE TO IF THIS IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND WE NEED IT TO BE. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE EXTENSIVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC ON THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY. SO THAT IS ALL UNDER WAY WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE A COMMUNICATION PLAN AS WE- FINISH THAT UP AND GET YOUR INPUT. THANK YOU AND IT FINALLY WHAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO ADDRESS THOSE. REFUSE TO VACCINATE VACCINATED. INCLUDING BATH DEFINITELY. I'D THINK THERE ANY PLAN TO MAKE VACCINATION MANDATORY AND SO WE ARE HOPING THAT THROUGH EDUCATION AND THROUGH. OUR SAFETY ANALYSIS THAT WE CONVINCE CAN COMMENCE AS MANY PEOPLE- AND- CAN SAY WITH SOME CERTAINTY THAT IT IS SAFE AND THAT WE WOULD BE. ENCOURAGING THROUGH EDUCATION NOT AS MANY CALIFORNIANS GET VACCINATED AS POSSIBLE. SURE AND I WAS IMPLYING THAT WE FORCED VACCINATIONS BUT WE DO HAVE THAT SIGNAL A PUBLIC THAT. HAS THEIR DOUBTS ALUMINUM. DESERVED AND LET'S SEE IF THE PLANNING ON HOW YOU PLAN ON BRINGING THEM EXCESSIVELY. TO GET A CALL THERE IMMUNITY. WE WALKED LIKE TO GET ME PEOPLE VACCINATED. SO I'M RIGHT I THINK WE CAN PLAY A PART IN HELPING YOU. GET THAT MESSAGE OUT THERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER DOCTOR READY CERTAIN ON WANT US. GO GO GO AHEAD WITH ARE GOING PLEASE GO AHEAD TOUGH THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE SORT UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO- MAKE SURE THAT THE VACCINE IS SAFE WE NEED TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT WILL BE COUNTING ON ALL OF YOU TO HELP US WITH THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO MANY OF YOU TO DETERMINE WHY I WAS LOOKING INTO- PRESIDENTS WHO ARE ONE TERM BUT IF WE LOOK BACK TO SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION IT WAS PRECEDED BY HERBERT HOOVER. AND I WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT FDR BECAUSE HE HAD A QUOTE THAT I THINK IS PARTICULARLY APPLICABLE TODAY. THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD THE HOPE. THE BELIEF THE CONVICTION THAT THERE IS A BETTER LIFE A BETTER WORLD TO BE ON THE HORIZON. AS WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY I HOPE OUR STATE IS LOOKING TOWARDS THE HORIZON IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OVERARCHING PLAN. AND SO MY QUESTION FOR MR CURRY IS. AS WELL AS MISS FANELLI IS WHAT IS THAT OVER ARCHING PLAN ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING TOWARDS OUR ECONOMY AND FOCUSING ON RECOVERY. WALLET GEOLOGY THAT THE BEST WAY FOR US TO GET OUR ECONOMY UP AND RUNNING IS FOR US TO CONTROL THE VIRUS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INTEGRATING THE BLUEPRINT FOR A SAFER KANEMI INTO THIS OVER ARCHING PLAN AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE WILLING% TO SHARE IT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THE QUESTION IS FOR MR CURRIER MISS FINALE I BELIEVE. HI THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SORRY LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY ON THE TECHNICAL- ABSOLUTELY I THINK AS I ALLUDED TO WHEN I DISCUSS THEIR EMERGENCY ORGANIZATION THAT YOU KNOW NOT ONLY COMES TOGETHER WHEN WE HAVE DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES BUT- ALSO HAS COME TOGETHER FOR THIS EMERGENCY IS THAT ABSOLUTELY THE FOCUS AND REALLY AKA A CORE COMPONENT OF THE ORGANIZATION IS TO LOOK AHEAD- WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED ADVANCE PLANNING LOOKING DOWN THE HORIZON- I'M NOT TRYING TO. MINIMIZE OR MARGINALIZE THE INCREDIBLE IMPACT IN EVERY CORNER OF OUR SOCIETY THAT IS AFFECTED BY THIS DISEASE IN THE DECISION MAKING- THAT WE DO NOW AND HOW THAT AFFECTS LATER- BUT WE- ABSOLUTELY ARE ARE LOOKING AHEAD AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO- TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO TALK ABOUT TALK THROUGH THAT TOGETHER I KNOW WE'VE HAD. SEVERAL FORUMS AN UPDATE SPECIALIZED- DISCUSSIONS AND IF ENOUGH ADVANCE PLANNING IS ONE OF THEM THEN WE'RE OPEN TO- TO HAVING A DIALOGUE ABOUT THAT BUT- YOU KNOW ART OUR JOB BACK HELLO YES IS ALSO TO MANAGE THE RECOVERY FROM DISASTERS NOT JUST THE RESPONSE AND- MAYBE THAT MANIFESTS TRADITIONALLY AND THINGS LIKE WILDFIRES IN THE REBUILDING AND DEBRIS CLEANUP- BUT CERTAINLY IT COMES INTO PLAY HERE- IT IS JUST- NOT SOMETHING THAT IS TYPICAL AND BY ANY STRETCH AND LOOKING AT. THAT YOU KNOW ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND KEEPING THEM IN MIND ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE IN THIS TYPE OF EVENTS BEYOND THE HEALTH AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT OUR ROLE IS TO DRAW IN THE US THE ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF STATE GOVERNMENT- BRING IN THE FEDERAL RESOURCES AND IMPORTANTLY MOST IMPORTANTLY WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE WHICH ARE VERY UNIQUE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND DO THAT WORK IN REAL TIME AND ALSO LOOKING AHEAD SO- MAYBE THAT ISN'T SPECIFICALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW DOCUMENT A PIECE OF PAPER BUT- THE FACT THAT OF ADVANCE PLANNING A LOOKING AHEAD IT AT WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. DO IN ORDER TO ALTERNATELY OVER COMMON AND MOVE FORWARD FROM THIS. THIS PARTICULAR BAND IS AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT WE'RE DOING IN REAL TIME IMMEDIATELY TO RESPOND- TO THINGS ARE CHANGING EVERY DAY. IN TERMS OF CASES AND HOW WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES TO MANAGE THOSE SO. I'M JUST HAPPY TO. TO I TALK MORE ABOUT THAT AND HOW WE CAN AND DOES COMMUNICATE AND COORDINATE. IN THAT AREA IN THE FUTURE AND I DON'T KNOW SUSAN HAS ANYTHING TO ADD BUT SHE'S HERE IN THE- ROOM. WITH ME AS WELL. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE BLUEPRINTS IF. THAT THE BLUEPRINT THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IS DESIGNED TO HELP US TO. REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS AND TO LOOK AT. BOTH THE HEALTH AND- PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE IMPACTS ON SO AS WE LOOK THROUGH. THAT PLAN OF HOW WE- USE SURVEILLANCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND THAT DISEASE TRANSMISSION. AND PEOPLE COUNTIES MOVE FROM TIER FORWARD OR BACK BASED ON THAT TRANSMISSION CASE RATE AND- TEST POSITIVITY OF TWELVE WELL OTHER HEALTH EQUITY MEASURE. THAT THAT TYPE TRAITS THE ABILITY TO REALLY CONTROL ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE DISEASE AND AS YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING. A SLIGHT INCREASE IN AN INCREASE IN CASES AND HOSPITALIZATIONS RIGHT NOW. AND SO REALLY PLANNING FOR THAT AND REALLY PUTTING IN PERSPECTIVE- ALL OF THOSE PIECES THAT NEED TO BE IN PLACE FROM. THE APTIAN SURVEILLANCE TO TESTING TO CONTACT TRACING. AND THEN ON TO VACCINE PLANNING. WHEN I STARTED I HAD BROUGHT UP FDR BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE HE HELPED US THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION TO LOOK TOWARDS THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET AS- SOMETHING THAT HELPED OUR COUNTRY DURING TIMES OF THE DAY. AND SO MY QUESTION IF I CAN IS HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN FOR THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THAT WOULD GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SPECIFICALLY. WE HEARD TODAY HOW UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE NUMBER ONE COST DRIVER WITHIN. WHAT WE ARE SPENDING OUR RESOURCES ON. BUT THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE WE- TALKED OR THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR HOUSING NEEDS THEIR FOOD INSECURITY AND- OTHER SERVICES THAT THEY MAY HAVE NEEDS IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS. SO AT THINK WE ARE TRYING TO LOOK. WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE'VE HAD WE'VE ON IS TO HAVE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS ACROSS SOCIAL SERVICES IF YOU LOOK AT HOUSING TO LOOK AT DELIVERY OF FOOD FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS AND WE DO AGREE THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT POPULATIONS ARE HIT ON MULTIPLE FRONTS FROM PAY- YEAH PAY DISPARITY TO YOU KNOW HOUSING TO FOOD PROGRAMS AND IF WE KNOW THAT. IF WE WANT FOLKS TO GET THROUGH THIS AND ALSO TO ISOLATE QUARANTINE AS NEEDED IF THEY ARE EXPOSED OR IN FACT AT THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ONE OF THE CATALYSTS- INDEED FOR THIS WAS A HEALTH EQUITY MEASURE TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE- PROGRESS AND DO BETTER IN THE STATE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS DO BETTER AND NOT HEALTHEQUITY MEASURE WAS INSTITUTED FOR THAT VERY REASON TO LOOK AT THAT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. EARLIER ON OUR CHAIR HAD ASKED ABOUT WHAT GAPS EXIST AND I BELIEVE IT ASKED FINANCE ABOUT IT AND I WANTED TO GIVE BOTH THE PH AND- YEAH SO CHANCE TO. ANSWER WHAT. GAPS THEY'VE NOTICED IN OUR- DELIVERY OF CARE DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND- WHAT'S BEING DONE TO MEET THOSE GAPS. BETWEEN I THINK WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS EVERY GAP AS WE- WE HAVE NOTICED THEM I THINK THAT. CLEARLY ONE OF THE GAPS THAT WE CONTINUE TO GUARD AGAINST AS TRYING TO CONTROL DISEASE TRANSMISSION SO THAT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM STAYS- ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN FACT THAT AND SO I THINK THAT. NATIONALLY YEAH THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH STAFF IN- AND HEALTH CARE AND SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE TITRATE SORT OF OPENING UP SECTORS LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE DOING SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THE NUMBER OF FOLKS IN OUR HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS OR IN OUR HOSPITALS PARTICULARLY- YEP KEEP OUR HEALTH SYSTEM STRONG ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE EVERYBODY COMING IN. SO I GAP IF THIS GETS BIGGER IT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE HOW CLINICAL STAFFING AND SO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ADDRESS THAT BUT IT WILL BE A NATIONAL PROBLEM. SO I LOVE THE WAY THAT YOU ANSWER THAT AND IF I COULD I WOULD SAY WE'VE NEED A FEDERAL PARTNER TO HELP TO LEAD DURING THIS CRISIS AND REALLY WOULD. LOOK TO THEM TO HELP US TO MEET ANY GAPS THAT MAY EXIST. NOW SINCE YOU MENTIONED PROVIDERS. YOU KNOW I'M A RECOVERING POSITION I ACTUALLY. PROVIDED CARE MYSELF BUT HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE R. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. AND SO NOW I ACTUALLY LIKE TO THINK OF MY SISTER WHO STILL IS PRACTICING AND HI SIR SHE'S A NURSE EDUCATOR THERE. AND I THINK A LOT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC FIFTEEN. THAT THIS TAKES WEEKS IT TAKES MONTHS IT IS NOT EASY ON THOSE WHO ARE. WORKING IN THE MIDST OF THIS EVERY DAY AND SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR RESILIENCY. HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT WERE SUPPORTING THE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS WORKING ON PATHWAYS FOR FUTURE PROVIDERS. WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY TRYING TO SUPPORT THEM WITH STAFFING WITH. FOOD SO WE HELP THEM WITH STAFFING WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE WITH I'M ONGOING DIALOGUE SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND ANY GAPS OR PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE HAVING. ARE ON HEALTH. HEALTHCARE ACQUIRED INFECTIONS PROGRAM PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO OUR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES EVERY DAY WE HAVE ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH WEEKLY WEBINARS FOR BOTH SNAPS AS WELL AS- OUR HOSPITALS. AND RELATED MEETING WITH THE ASSOCIATION THE PROVIDER ASSOCIATIONS ON A ON GOING BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND. ANY GAPS WE ARE ISSUING GUIDANCE ON WEEKLY TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE WE HAVE ALSO YOU KNOW A LOT OF STAFFING WAIVERS FOR THOSE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE RUN INTO STAFFING- ISSUES- SO REALLY I THINK OPENING THAT DIALOGUE MAKING SURE WE'RE AWARE OF ANY OF TOSE GAPS AND THEN. WORKING WITH OUR PROVIDER ASSOCIATIONS AND OUR FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS. TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT COME UP. YOU KNOW I WIL AND- OUR PRESIDENT ELECT ACTUALLY REMINDED ME OF A SONG. HE SAID WEEPING MAY ENDURE FOR THE NIGHT BUT JOY COMETH IN THE MORNING. MANY OF US HAVE FELT LIKE THIS IS A NEW DAY FOR US HERE IN AMERICA AND THERE IS A LOT OF ENJOY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US HERE IN THE STATE BUT I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO AGAIN COMPLEMENT OUR GOVERNOR WHO I REALLY FELT TOOK THE BULL BY THE HORNS. DURING THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRISIS AND THAT THE ACTION HELPED TO SAVE LIVES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR CITY. AND SO REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE GOING FORWARD THERE WERE ACTUALLY MAKING A PLAN THAT'S GOING TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO ANSWER ASK QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR. THANK ARAMBULA I THINK. MISSED MISTER GRAY HAD. IF YOU QUESTIONS. FOR THE RECORD QUICKLY THOUGH NEED TO MOVE TO OUR FINAL PANEL BUT BOTH FOR OUR CUSTOMERS SERVICES AS WELL AS- DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED CAL REGISTED YEAH WE TALKED A NUMBER THE MEMBERS HERE HAVE TALKED. ABOUT THE- REALITY IN AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE THE NORM. AND THE LACK OF RESOURCES BOTH FINANCIALLY THAT HAVE MADE IT TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS- PP SUPPLIES TESTING ETCETERA. N. WITH THE PEAKS AND VALLEYS OF. INFECTION OUR IT SEEMS THAT I KNOW OF MY DISTRICT WE CAN ONE WEEKLY TALKING ABOUT CLOSING DOWN TESTING CENTERS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING UTILIZED. AND THE NEXT WEEK. TALKING ABOUT MOVING INTO YOU KNOW PURPLE TEAR- PROVIDERS- INFECTION RATES AND- THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY FRUSTRATING CHU HAS ANYONE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY. OF PUTTING TOGETHER A RAPID RESPONSE TEAM FROM DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND DOOR YES OR SOME COMBINATION OF. WHEN AN EMPLOYER IN AN AREA HAS AN OUTBREAK. RATHER THAN ALL THE BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS PONTIFICATING ABOUT HOW SOMEBODY SHOULD DO SOMETHING WE pTO THE EPIDEMIC RIGHT TO THE HOT SPOT AND DEAL WITH THAT WHEN I SAID RESOURCES I MEAN TESTING. EP SUPPLIES WHATEVER THAT EMPLOYER NEEDS I KNOW I'VE HEARD IN OTHER STATES THIS KIND OF AN APPROACH. IN MY EXPERIENCE CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL MY COLLEAGUES FROM MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN IN OUR STATE. WE'RE SIMPLY- KIND OF TELLING THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH THE SHOULD BE DOING BUT WHEN THEY SAY BACK TO US HEY. I CAN'T ACQUIRE THE RESOURCES OR YOU KNOW I CAN'T GET THE TESTING CAPACITY WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT- HAS THAT. TYPE OF A SEAL TEAM SIX CORONAVIRUS RAPID RESPONSE OCCURRED TO ANYONE. VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH SOME OF OUR NEW EFFORTS AS WE BRING ON THE PERKINELMER LAB AND WE BRING ON ON THIS MOBILE TESTING WE HAVE BEEN DOING SORT OF THE STRIKE FORCE TEAMS GOING INTO COUNTIES AND WORKING WITH THEM WE HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER CDFA THAT COUNTY HOW OSHA ARE AND- ALL THE DISK DIFFERENT ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES AS WELL AS THE EDUCATION- ENTITIES TO. TRY TO COME TOGETHER AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS AND DRESS THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES AND OTHER ESSENTIAL ON BUSINESSES SO I THINK IT IS THE EXACTLY ON OUR MINDS OF HOW TO DO MORE OF THAT AND AS WE NOW HAVE CONTRACTS TO BRING ON MORE MOBILE TESTING MORE RESOURCES FOR TESTING AND- WE WILL BE DOING MORE OF THAT AND WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS I THINK THAT. YEAH WE HAVE CONTINUED THAT EFFORT NOT ONLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE BOTTOM WITH IMPERIAL COUNTY STARTING AT AND NOW LOOKING AT A FEW SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WHERE THERE ARE ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYER AND WORKER ISSUES AS WELL SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT AND WE AGREE THAT THOSE STRIKE TEAMS AND NOT ALL OF GOVERNMENT REALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THE HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE- IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. TO DATE. WELL IT JUST FOR BREAK I'VE- EXPERIENCED CONVERSE. WITH PUBLIC HEALTH OR WITH WITH OH YES- WHERE WE'RE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS. AND THERE HASN'T BEEN A RESPONSE I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THAT'S OUT THERE. I'D LIKE TO BE. MADE IT'S REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF THOSE PLANS AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE PHONE NUMBER SO THAT I CAN CALL IT WHAT WE'RE FACING THESE ISSUES IN MY DISTRICT GET IMMEDIATE RESPONSE BECAUSE- MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. SO APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER BUT I DO WANNA. HAVE SOME OFFLINE FOLLOW UP ON THAT TOPIC. SURE WE'RE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP. A QUICK QUESTION FOR HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP. Q. SO MUCH A QUICK QUESTION FOR W. DIRECTOR FROM CURRY- I KNOW AS AS WE SORT OF STARTED OFF THE HEARING. ALL WE ASK IS USED TO WORKING IN A PARTICULAR FASHION AND WE APPRECIATE THAT GIVEN THE URGENCY IN THE NATURE OF EMERGENCIES. NOW THERE WILL BE A STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT IS INDEFINITE- ARE YOU HAVE HAVE YOU CHANGED OR WHAT PROTOCOLS HAVE YOU CHANGED. YOU KNOW AS YOUR OPERATING THIS PANDEMIC THAT HAS SUCH AGAIN AN EXPANSIVE VIEW YOU TOUCH EVERY PART OF THE STATE YOU TOUCH EVERY PERSON IN THE STATE- AND SO GIVEN THAT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN SAY A WILDFIRE OR EVEN A DROUGHT WORDS VERY SPECIFIC- SO WHAT PROTOCOLS HAVE YOU CHANGE AND HOW YOU'RE OPERATING IN REFERENCE TO THIS PANDEMIC I THINK IN PARTICULAR- OUR FRUSTRATIONS OF LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN- TRADITIONALLY THE LEGISLATORS WHOSE AREAS ARE IMPACTED- BY A PARTICULAR EMERGENCY WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE WE US THAT'S BEEN THE FEEDBACK WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW FOR MR GALLAGHER. OR FROM YOUR DOCTOR WORD ON THE FIELD JUST THEIR THEIR OR THEIR PARTNER IN THAT RESPONSE OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEGISLATORS THAT ARE TOUCH IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR EVERYBODY TO FEEL THAT SAME LEVEL OF OWNERSHIP AND OBVIOUSLY THE SCALE OF WHICH IS TO ME THAT YOU'VE NEVER PROBABLY IN YOUR LIFETIME NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH AND HOPEFULLY WE NEVER WILL HAVE TO YOU KNOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS. SORT OF SCOPE AGAIN CAN YOU. JUST WALK US THROUGH IT YOU KNOW. PLEASE OF WHAT WHAT CHANGE HAVE BEEN AWARE TO YOU PLAN MAKING TO. KIND OF ADAPT TO THE- SIZE OF A EMERGENCY. AND THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND ABSOLUTELY OUR SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED IT'S BEEN AROUND IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME KNOWING THAT WE HAVE. A MULTI HAZARD FOCUS AND- YOU KNOW AND IT WAS DESIGNED WITH IN MIND YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE FOR WHATEVER WE FACE BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S REALLY UNPRECEDENTED ICERTAINLY IN MY EXPERIENCE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT NOT ONLY REACHES WE'VE HAD DISASTERS THAT HAVE TOUCHED EVERY CALIFORNIA ALL AT ONCE WE'VE HAD FLOODS WE'VE HAD THOSE TYPE OF THINGS BUT THIS ONE- WITH THAT SO MANY FACETS OF IT. AND THAT ARE AFFECTING EVERY PART OF SOCIETY REALLY IS UNUSUAL AND- A CHALLENGE TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE COHESIVE AND COORDINATED AND- AS RESPONSIVE OR AM IN COMMUNICATING OUR RESPONSIVENESS. AS AS THE SAME WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO SUCCESSFULLY AS YOU MENTION AND WILD WILDFIRES AND EARTHQUAKES THINGS ARE LITTLE MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY CENTRIC- SO I CAN SAY THAT AND WE LEARNED A LOT- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS WAS UNPRECEDENTED WE DIDN'T KNOW WE DID THINGS DIDN'T GO PERFECTLY. AND HOPEFULLY WE'VE IMPROVED AND ADJUSTED I'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN JUST WITH A DIFFERENT FORMS THAT WE'VE- HAD WE YOU KNOW WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE COUNTIES WITH- ARE DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED- I THINK THAT- ANOTHER THING THAT IS- YOU KNOW KIND OF IMPORTANT TO SAY IS THAT WE ARE. ADJUSTING THEIR RESPONSE AND- BRINGING THAT STATE FAMILY TOGETHER TO ANTICIPATE AND THEN REACT TO IT IN IN YOU KNOW KIND OF A ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT THIS VERY COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN- DIFFERENT AGENCIES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS. ALL RESPONDING TO SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR WORLD AND THAT REALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT- THERE COULD BE TREMENDOUS OVERLAP OR CONFLICT THAT CAN ARISE WITHOUT WE'RE ALLOCATING OUR RESOURCES. AND WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT FROM EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER KINDS OF EVENTS OR FOR MANAGING MULTIPLE EVENTS ALL AT ONCE THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO CENTRALIZE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE UNIFIED IN OUR STATE SAID THAT WERE UNIFIED IN HOW RESPONDING TO YOU. AND TO YOUR CONSISTENT CONSTITUENTS SO I DO IN ORDER TO. SO MUCH. AS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE UNDERSTANDING IS EVOLVING AND WE'RE WILLING TO AND HAVE ADJUSTED. AS THIS PANDEMIC HAS EVOLVED AND- ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO A WHOLE NOTHER- COMPONENT OF IT TO THAT WILL BE A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS- ASSET IN GETTING PAST THIS PANDEMIC OR AT LEAST GETTING. IMPROVING THE- OUR ABILITY TO CONTEND WITH THAT WHICH IS THE VACCINE PLANNING. SO ALL OF THAT ADJUSTMENT HAPPENS IN REAL TIME- IT IS GOING TO REMAIN A CHALLENGE FRANKLY TO KIND OF KEEP THAT THIS- YOU KNOW EVERY CALIFORNIA AND EVERY ENTITY THAT. REPRESENTS THEM WHETHER IT'S PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR LAYERS OF GOVERNMENT- YOU KNOW POSSIBLY IN FRONT OF THE COMMUNICATION THAT. YEAH OKAY. OKAY I'M YET MEL. A COUPLE THIS IS OKAY FOLLOW. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT- MR GALLAGHER WHO'S ON VIRTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO. ASK A QUESTION MAKE A COMMENT MISTER GALLAGHER LET'S HOPE THIS WORKS. ARE YOU HAVE TO YOU YOURSELF. AND WE SEE WE SEE AN ICON ON SCREEN BUT YOU HAVE AND YOU TO YOURSELF YEAH. IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. SURE THE. MISTER CHAIRMAN THE- OUR COLLEGE SEEMS TO BE IMPERSONATING ME WITH MY INITIALS. WITH THE IT IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER HE WOULD HAVE THE SAME INITIALS. TO OKAY MISTER GALLAGHER YOU'RE ON MUTED- IF YOU TALK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU. SINCE SINCE WE KNOW USUALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM TALKING. TO ME I WOULDN'T KNOW NOW YOU'RE MUTED AGAIN. NO THAT'S THAT'S WITH CALIBER WE'RE NOT. MR GALLAGHER C. FIVE. BOB CHRISTIE JACKET DEAD JUMPER WITH THE NATIONAL CROSS OKAY MR GRECO ONE QUESTION WALL MISTER CALDERON SAVE WHAT YOU ON TO START TALKING AND WE'LL TRY TO GET TO YOU RIGHT AWAY. THE QUESTION REGARDING THE. ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH ON THE- SCIENTIFIC SAFETY REVIEW WORK GROUP AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE MISTER COOPER- MADE THE POINT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN WHAT ROLE WE PLAY IN THE WRONG VACCINE- I'M CURIOUS. IS THE VACCINE- SAFETY SIGN CONSIDER VIEW WORKERS THAT OU NEED TO CALIFORNIA IS THAT SOMETHING OTHER STATES ARE ALSO DOING. AND ESTABLISHING I GUESS KIND OF THE PROTOCOL REFER WORDY WITH WHICH TO THE ROLLOUT OR OR POTENTIALLY BLOCK ACCESS TO FDA APPROVED VACCINE. THAT'S LIKE A SPACE MAY LEGISLATION TO PLAY A ROLE OR MAYBE NOT- BUNKERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER. AWESOME A SCIENTIFIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I'M AND SO WE YEAH WE ARE WORKING WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON OUR COMMITTEE ARE ALSO WORKING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WE HAVE ACT THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO FTA INFORMATION REAL TIME WE EXPECT THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD. LIKELY COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSIONS AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE REVIEWED ALL OF THE DETAIL AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BUILD TRUST- WE HAVE OUR OWN CALIFORNIANS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALL OF THAT SAME. SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND WE HAVE ACTS LOOKING UP THAT. THE TUBE THAT TRUST AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ACTIVATION CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE BUT IT JUST KIND OF BRINGS I GUESS THE QUESTION I'M ASKING IS YOU CAN UNDER WHAT AUTHORITY CAN WE DO THAT CAN STATES- BONTA DOES THAT INVOLVE THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR CAN DO- UNILATERALLY- I'VE BEEN I WOULD HOPE THE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID IS TRUE WHICH IS FARTHER SELVES WHERE WE'RE COORDINATING WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE SOME WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF THESE PAST FEW YEARS BUT HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO SEE- HERE GOING FORWARD BUT IN THE CASE THAT WE DON'T ARRIVE AT THE SAME CONCLUSION. WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US. I THINK WE'RE EXPLORING THAT ARE ON AND WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF LEGAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO. I WE HOPE THAT WON'T BE THE CASE BUT IF THAT WERE TO ARISE I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE MORE ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF WHAT VACCINE WE THINK. IS SAFEST AND WHY AND WHO IT'S SAFE FOR. ON BUT I THINK THE LEGAL ISSUES ARE STILL ON. UNRESOLVED AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT HAPPY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION AS WE RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER GALLAGHER. CHAIRMAN PERFECT CAN YOU HEAR ME OK NOW. SO HOW MUCH ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- FIRST I JUST WANT TO AGREE WITH. THE REMARKS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM MERCED- WITH REGARD TO THE EARLIER PANEL- WE'VE SEEN GRABBED A GREAT DISPARITY. BETWEEN THE MONIES THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO MORE URBAN AREAS AND THOSE TO MORE RURAL AND I. I WANTED TO JUST ADD TO THAT WHAT WE ALSO SAW. WAS A DELAY IN THE MONEY GETTING SENT OUT TO THOSE RURAL COUNTIES AND THAT THAT MONEY WAS PARCELED OUT SLOWLY. AND IT WAS GIVEN BUT TO THE URBAN COUNTIES IT WAS GIVEN AS A COMPLETE- FUNDING EARLIER IN TIME. WHICH WAS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC- FOR RURAL COUNTIES WHO ARE ALREADY SUFFERING. THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND THE LOSS OF REVENUE. ALL THE SAME. NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT- THE URBAN PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE EXPERIENCED WE ALL EXPERIENCE THOSE THINGS- AND TO DELAY THE CARE IS ACT FUNNY NOW AS WAS DONE- WAS JUST COMPLETELY WRONG. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THERE IS SUCH A DISPROPORTIONATE DIFFERENCE. IN THE FUNDING. YOU'RE LISTENING TO THAT PANEL I THINK IT IS IT'S JUST BECOME VERY ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO ME. THAT THERE IS NO PARTNERSHIP WHATSOEVER. BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW. I MEAN WE'VE JUST HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO HEAR. FROM THE EXECUTIVES THAT FROM THE AGENCIES THAT THEY BASICALLY HAVE JUST GONE BEYOND THE AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THEM THAT THEY CONTINUE TO SPEND MONEY WITHOUT YOU KNOW GIVING THE PROPER NOTICE WITHOUT HAVING THE PROPER CONSULTATION. WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE CONTINUE TO DO IT THEY JUST TELL US HERE TODAY. WE'RE SORRY ABOUT THAT I WILL TRY TO DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE- BUT THERE THERE REALLY IS NO PARTNERSHIP WHATSOEVER THEY KEEP SAYING THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP. BUT THE REALITY IS SOMETHING FAR DIFFERENT AND IT'S I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO UTILIZE OUR POWER THE POWER OF THE PURSE WE CAN PULL FUNDING BACK AWAY FROM THEM WE CAN- ALSO. SIR OUR OUR POWERS TO RESTRICT HIS AUTHORITY UNDER THE EMERGENCY. SERVICES ACT- NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE CONTINUE TO SEE IS A COMPLETE ABUSE OF THE AUTHORITY AND THE MONEY IN THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN GRANTED AND WITHOUT THE PROPER CONSULTATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO ACT. NOW GET INTO THE SECOND PANEL I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS. YOU ARE MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO I WILL AGREE WITH HIM THAT THE INITIAL RESPONSE HERE. SAVE LIVES THE FLATTENING OF THE CURVE. RESPONSE I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES WAS THE RIGHT DECISION. AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WAS PREPARED FOR THE CASE IS THAT- THAT WE ALTERNATELY SIDE NOT THEN BUT IN JULY. JUNE JULY WHEN WE SAW THE SPIKE IN CASES WE FLATTEN THE CURVE. ONLY TO SEE THOSE CASES COME IN JUNE AND JULY. IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WAS BETTER ABLE TO HANDLE IT. NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS BLUEPRINT METRIC. AND I AND I AND I AND I JUST WANT TO JUST SHOW THIS SHOW THIS VERY CLEARLY FOR EVERYBODY. WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN THEY COUNTY GOES BACK TO PURPLE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GOOD WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A RISING CASES WHICH EVERYONE HAD TALKED ABOUT AND ANTICIPATED WE'RE GOING TO SEE A RISE IN CASES IN THE FALL NOBODY I DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY SAYING THAT WE WOULD NOT SEE RISING CASES THIS IS COMPLETELY ANTICIPATED. AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS READY TO PROVIDE FOR AND RESPOND TO THAT RISE. IN CASES. ONLY SEE THAT RISING CASES. MANY OF WHICH THE SOURCE OF THOSE CASES ARE PRIVATE GATHERINGS. THE RESULT OF GOING BACK TO PURPLE IS NOT TO GO FIND THE SOURCE OF THOSE CASES AND TO TRY TAKE MITIGATING EFFECTS TOWARDS THOSE ACTUAL CASES THAT WERE SEEN. NO THE ARBITRARY COMPLETELY ARBITRARY RESPONSES TO SHUT DOWN SMALL BUSINESS AGAIN. WHO'VE ALREADY BEEN WHO ARE ALREADY ON THE BRINK OF GOING OUT MANY OF THEM ALREADY HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF THE LAST- SHUT DOWN. AND TO SHUT DOWN CHURCHES. WHICH ALSO THERE'S BEEN NO SOURCES OF AN OUTBREAK DUE TO CHURCH SERVICES CERTAINLY HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN MY REGION. AND SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WEE SEEN. THIS ARBITRARILY SHUT DOWN THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO MEANWHILE EVERY HOOK EVERY LOAN LOWE'S AND HOME DEPOT- IN OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE SOMEHOW DEEMED ESSENTIAL KEEP GOING ON YOU KNOW FULL BLAST PEOPLE IN THEIR EVERYDAY SOMETIMES ARE MASSIVE TIMES OR NOT- YEAH THERE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION AND NEXUS TO. THE CONSEQUENCES OF MOVING BACK TO A PURPLE TEAR AND WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING ON THE GROUND. SO I KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THIS BLUEPRINT IT'S NOT SAVING LIVES IT'S ACTUALLY MORE FUNDAMENTALLY HURTING LIVES. BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING RISES IN IN SUICIDE WE ARE SEEING RISE IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH A 60% INCREASE IN BUTTE COUNTY AND USE USE NEEDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- WE ARE SEEING. PEOPLE NOT GOING INTO GET CARE- THAT THEY NEEDED AND IN HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES- THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS BLUEPRINT. METRIC FAR OUTWEIGH ANY BENEFITS THAT IS PROVIDING. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR I MEAN. ANYBODY IN PUBLIC HEALTH CAN TELL ME HOW IN THE WORLD. THAT IT MAKES SENSE THAT THAT THE THAT THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE TO SHUT DOWN SMALL BUSINESSES AND CHURCHES. AND THAT SOMEHOW THAT IS GOING TO MITIGATE. LEAVING EVERYTHING ELSE OPEN ESSENTIALLY LEAVING ALL OTHER THINGS OPEN- YES WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO GATHER PRIVATELY BUT THEY'RE STILL DOING IT- YOU KNOW SO. THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY GET PUNISHED ON YOUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES CHURCHES. YOUR NAIL SALONS- RESTAURANT THE RESTAURANT OWNERS THAT'S WHO ENDS UP GETTING AS A PRACTICAL MATTER SHUT DOWN INTO THE SYSTEM AND- AND FEEL THE FULL BRUNT OF THIS ARBITRARY RESPONSE MEANWHILE NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS CASES STILL GO UP- AND WE AND WE MANAGE THEM JUST LIKE WE DID LAST TIME. AND SOMEHOW THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPONSIBLE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS I'M SORRY I DON'T SEE IT AND NONE OF MY CONSTITUENCY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM PUBLIC HEALTH HOW IS IT I MEAN IT ALSO IS VERY BIASES OF EVENT COUNTLESS CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. BIASED AGAINST RULE AREAS- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW WORLD METRIC BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THIS% ARBITRARY NATURE. OF THE RESPONSE- AND HOW IT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS ONLY CERTAIN PARTS OF SOCIETY AND ONLY CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY REAL NEXUS TO. RESPONDING TO THE CASES THAT WERE SEEN ON THE GROUND. AND IS IT ANY WONDER WHY WERE SEEN PEOPLE JUST NOT FOLLOWING. I MEAN I WOULD LOVE ANY RESPONSE THAT MAKES ANY KINDOF SENSE- FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. AND AGAIN WE HAD NO WE AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF HAD ABSOLUTELY NO INPUT INTO THIS. AB HAVE NO ABILITY TO ESTABLISH A EVEN THOUGH THAT WE ARE THE LAW MAKING BODY OF THE LAND BUT- ONE GROUP OF BUREAUCRATS IN PUBLIC HEALTH. IS TO DECIDE THIS ISSUE FOR EVERYBODY. THROUGHOUT SOCIETY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION SO PLEASE. EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOUR METRIC MAKES ANY KIND OF SENSE. AND HOW ARE RESPONDING TO THIS CRISIS. SO I WILL START AND SAY THAT THE BLUEPRINT IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE A SLOW PROGRESSION FORWARD TO LIMIT THE MOBILITY ACROSS THE STATE WE ONLY HAVE SO MANY TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX OF WHAT WE CAN. DO TO SLOW THAT MOBILITY AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE WISH THAT EVERYBODY WOULD HE ADHERE TO THE M. HE EYES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE THE MASKING THE SOCIAL DISTANCING THE LIMITATION ON HOUSEHOLD GATHERINGS. BUT THERE ARE INDEED YOU KNOW THOSE ARE CAUSING TRANSMISSION BUT TRANSMISSION IS BEING CALLED IN SOME OF THESE OTHER SETTINGS AS WELL AND AS WE DO FURTHER AND FURTHER RESEARCH AND COLLECT INFORMATION ON OUTBREAKS THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF OUTBREAKS IN SOME OF THESE OTHER SECTORS AS WELL. RETAILERS THAT YOU HVE BUT I AM SOME OF THE RESTAURANTS AND OTHER THINGS SO WE'VE TRIED TO DO A RISK ANALYSIS AND LOOK AT WHERE WE CAN OPEN MORE SAFELY AND AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE TEARS. TO CONTINUE TO OPEN ON BUT AS YOU MOVE BACK WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT IS ESSENTIAL TO LIMIT THAT MOVEMENT SO THAT WE CAN KEEP TRANSMISSION DOWN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE- WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE THE SMALL COUNTY METRIC. NOVEL BUT LOOKS AT ON ACTUAL CASES RATHER THAN CASE RATE TO ALLOW A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN OUR RURAL COUNTIES WE HAVE LOOKED AT OBSERVATION PERIOD SO THAT WE COULD SEE IF DATA WAS TRENDING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE- WERE ON WE'VE WAITED A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE MOVING BACK TO THE SMALL COUNTIES- AND GIVE THEM TIME TO SORT OF. ADJUST TO MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN THEIR DATA SO WE ARE VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO A SLOW RE OPENING OF CALIFORNIA TO KEEP THE TRANSMISSION DOWN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE- YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS AT A ONE FOR ONE MATCH FOR EVERY SECTOR AND EVERY. TEAR AND EVERY BUSINESS NOW BUT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE LIMITING OF MOBILITY ACROSS THE SECTORS. DOES HELP TO REDUCE TRANSMISSION. FOLLOW UP ADD TO THAT. EVEN IF I'M FOLLOWING YOUR REASONING AND YOU'RE TRYING TO LIMIT MOVEMENT WHY JUST RESTAURANTS YEAH WHY JUST- BARBER SHOPS NAIL SALONS- I MEAN CERTAINLY THERE'S MOVEMENT IN LARGE BIG BOX STORES I MEAN. THERE'S NOTHING IN YOUR METRIC THAT SHUTS THEM DOWN. I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONTINUING TO TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND I'M HAND PLEASE I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU BECOME MORE RESTRICTIVE PLEASE DON'T READ THAT IN MY COMMENTS. AT ALL BUT IF THAT'S TRULY THE CASE HOW COME THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON ON TRAVEL- TO DIFFERENT. TO DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND LOOKING AT OTHER- SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY THAT ALSO RELY ON MOVEMENT. AND PEOPLE GATHERING IN IN CERTAIN PLACES- I GET IT IT MAKES NO SENSE YOU'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON ONE PART OF THE COMMUNIST IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT THE MOST. THROUGHOUT SINCE MARCH THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN MULTIPLE TIMES. AND I ARE GOING TO GO SHUT THEM DOWN ONCE AGAIN. I MEAN I HATE TO KEEP USING IT BUT LOWE'S AND HOME DEPOT OR OPEN RECORD YEARS. RECORD YEARS AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE ARE GETTING DESTROYED. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU KNOW HOW DID YOU MISTER GALLAGHER YEAH. WE DO HAVE TO HURRY UP SURGED IF YOU ASK A QUESTION PRECIADO IT AND THEN TRY TO GET OUT FROM THE SPINELLI. WELL I MEAN STOP THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS WHY DOES THIS APPLY TO. MANY OTHER SIMILAR TYPE OF INDUSTRIES ACROSS THE BOARD YOU'RE ONLY FOCUSING. ON RESTAURANTS NAIL SALONS SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT'S WHO HAS TO SHUT DOWN WE GO BACK TO PURPLE. AND YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE CAN GATHER IN THEIR CHURCH. EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THOSE THINGS AND MAKE CONNECTED OUTBREAKS. FIRST OFF START BY SAYING SOME OF THOSE THE EIGHT WE ARE SEEING EVIDENCE OF OUTBREAKS AND SOME OF THOSE FACTORS THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF OTHER SECTORS THAT CAN'T OPEN UNTIL WE GOT TO- EITHER THE ORANGE OR YELLOW TIER SO IT'S NOT JUST A FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES BUT- I'M WE AGREE THAT SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES ARE. DO POSE SOME RISKS WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T BE A MATH CAN'T NECESSARILY BE DISPENSED- AND THEN WE HAVE TO MEASURE AND BALANCE THAT WITH SOME OF OUR CENTRAL SERVICES WHERE PEOPLE DO NEED TO GET FOOD AND DO NEED TO GET OTHER THINGS JUST TO DO THAT TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT DAILY LIFE SO I THINK THAT. IT'S A BALANCING ACT THERE'S NO PERFECT ANSWER ON BUT WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN TO TRY TO- SLOW THE MOVEMENT AND TO SLOW TRANSMISSION AND SO WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED AND MORE THINGS AS WE LOOK AT THE RISK ADJUSTMENTS AND LOOK AT. HOW ON BUSINESSES HAVE COME TO US AND EXPLAIN HOW THEY CAN OPEN MORE SAFELY WE HAVE MOVED SOME THINGS BACK INTO PURPLE HERE AND ALLOW THEM TO OPEN ON ME AND SO I THINK IT'S A CONTINUING DIALOGUE ON AND WITH THE BUSINESS SECTORS WE'VE TRIED TO WORK VERY CLOSELY ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION. AND EACH OF THE BUSINESS SECTORS TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT THEY CAN PUT IN PLACE WHAT ON AND. CONTINUE TO MODIFY OUR GUIDANCE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR MISS AGUIAR-CURRY THE MEGA MOVES TO THE NEXT AND I'LL MAKE IT REAL QUICK AND THIS IS FOR- MISS FANELLI- ONE OF THE TOPIC THAT COMES UP. IN MANY OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES IS OUR- US SNIFFS IN THOSE- RESIDENTIAL HOMES THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE HIGHER RATES. THE THROW OFF OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES NUMBERS AND THEREFORE CLOSING SOME OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES- WHAT ARE WE DOING TO I MEAN. WE SEEM TO HAVE A HOT BED IN SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES FOR THOSE. AND NUMBER ONE- WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH- THOSE NUMBERS THAT DON'T AFFECT THE REST OF COMMUNITY. COLLEGE AND IF I AM SURE YOU'VE BEEN THIS IS FROM BROUGHT UP NUMEROUS TIMES BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE ONE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND YELLOW COUNTY THAT HAVE LIKE FIFTY CASES OF POSITIVE AND- REALLY THREW OFF THE ENTIRE COUNTY. AND I'M SURE THIS IS HAPPENING IN OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT- AGAIN- IF YOU COULD JUST KIND OF. ANSWER THAT AND THEN ALSO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU I KNOW THIS IS TOUGH. THESE THE THIS IS SOMETHING NEW TO ALL OF US AND WE HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS BUT- AS- SO MY COLLEAGUES SAID OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. ONE PLACE TO THE TABLE. AND SO WE'RE HERE. TODAY SO WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH ON OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ON OUR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES WE HAVE A- I HEALTHCARE ACQUIRED INFECTIONS TEAM INFECTION PREVENTION US THAT PROVIDE. ON A CONTINUING ON SITE HELP AS WELL AS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE VIRTUALLY. I'M WE DO LOOK AT EACH OF THOSE FACILITIES TRY TO WORK. ON MITIGATING THOSE OUTBREAKS WE PUT IN. PLACE A NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE SERIAL TESTING OF STAFF. TO TRY TO VERY QUICKLY GOT ON TOP OF- ANY YEAH WE KNOW THAT. THE TRANSMISSION IS HAPPENING LARGELY THROUGH STAFF COMING INTO THE FACILITIES. AND SO TRIED THAT TESTING OF STAFF GOT FROM EARLY INDICATOR OF- ANYBODY WHO IS IN FACT THAT- AND ALLOWS US TO COHORT AND- YOU HAVE- ISOLATE QUARANTINE THAT STAFF SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE TRANSMISSION. WE UNDERSTAND THAT- THOSE NUMBERS DO YOU SORT OF IMPACT A SMALL COUNTIES IN BIGGER WAYS. GIVEN THE NUMBERS THAT COULD BE AND IN FACT IT. I HOWEVER WE DO THINK THAT IT DOES LEAD TO COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION AND BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE THEY- THE STAFF PEOPLE AND OTHERS ARE BACK AND FORTH INTO THE COMMUNITY AND SO WE HAVE NOT- BEEN YET. SORT OF LOOKING AT WAYS TO AND TAKE THOSE NUMBERS OUT. BUT RATHER TO WORK TO VERY QUICKLY MITIGATE THAT IMPACT AND- ALTHOUGH IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON ON CASES FOR. A FEW DAYS OR A WEEK WE ARE HOPING THAT WE CAN GET THAT QUICKLY UNDER CONTROL AND BRING IT BACK. I'M TO GET THOSE NUMBERS BACK. WE DO HAVE AN ADJUDICATION PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE CAN MAKE A CASE. IF THERE'S A PARTICULARLY. IMPACTFUL SITUATION AND WE WILL EVALUATE. THAT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THANK YOU LET ME JUST THANK THE- PANELISTS FOR PARTICIPATING ALSO JUST THANK THEM ALL FOR THEIR HARD WORK WE REALLY DO. I MUCH APPRECIATED AND WE ALL. WORKING TOGETHER AND TRYING TO- YOU KNOW GET OUT GET A HOLD OF THE SITE PANDEMICS ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ONE COMMENTS. ARE WE ARE NOT GOING TO THE NEXT PANEL I'M GOING TO ASK THAT EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE ARE SHORT ON TIME. IF THEY COULD JUST LIMIT THEIR STATEMENTS TO TWO MINUTES MAXIMUM. AND THEN WE COULD MAKE SURE WE LEAVE ROOM FOR QUESTIONS SO WE HAVE W. DIRECTOR SHELL FROM DTS. THE B. DIRECTOR SHALL EITHER. AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND START YOU HEAR ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY IN THE INTEREST OF SAVING TIME- I WILL GO RIGHT TO THE QUESTION ABOUT- THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS FOR PROCURING- THE CRITICAL PP ITEMS THAT WERE NEEDED BY THE STATE- DGS PUT TOGETHER- DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE WERE DIRECTED TO PROCURE LARGE CACHES OF PP AND TARGET AMOUNTS WE DID PUT TOGETHER A SPECIAL BOOK PROCUREMENT TEAM THAT WILL FOCUS SOLELY ON PROCUREMENT OF PP- WE USED TO BE A COVERT NINETEEN WEBSITE- THE MEDICAL SUPPLY CONTRIBUTIONS PORTAL THAT WAS LAUNCHED ON APRIL FOURTH TWO VET VENDORS IN THE SYSTEM- IT WENT THROUGH MULTI PHASED PROCESS. AND ONCE THE LEADS WERE VALIDATED THEY WERE SENT TO THE BULK PROCUREMENT TEAM FOR FINAL PURCHASE. THE ONES THAT LEAD WAS FORWARDED TO THE PROCUREMENT TEAM THEY USE THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO DETERMINE IF A PROCUREMENT COULD BE EXECUTED. VENDORS WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE A QUOTE WITH PRICING DELIVERY SCHEDULES COPIES OF PRODUCTS SPECIFICATIONS AND DEPENDING ON THE BY CHAIN OF CUSTODY INFORMATION SUCH AS LOCATION THE MANUFACTURE. STORAGE FREIGHT FORWARDER FOR OUT OF COUNTRY PURCHASES AND ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NECESSARY VENDORS WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE A PAY DATA RECORD THAT INCLUDED BUSINESS INFORMATION SUCH AS FEDERAL TAX ID. BUSINESS ENTITY TYPE IN RESIDENCY STATUS. BYERS THEN TOOK THAT INFORMATION AND THEY EVALUATED QUOTES TO DETERMINE REASONABLE PRICING AGAINST BOTH TARGET PRICING AND PRICING OF OTHER VENDORS THAT WERE SELLING SIMILAR PRODUCTS. TIMELY DELIVERY SCHEDULES PRODUCTS MEETING SPECIFICATIONS AND WHETHER A CHAIN OF CUSTODY WAS ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED. BUYERS AND EVALUATED PAY DATA INFORMATION THROUGH REVIEW OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE WEB PORTAL FOR BUSINESSES IN GOOD STANDING. VERIFICATION OF WEBSITES FOR SUPPLIERS AND THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS OUT OF STATE BUSINESS PORTALS THAT COULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE STANDING OF THE VENDOR AND FISCAL INFORMATION FOR OUR EXISTING BUYERS. I'M SORRY VENDORS HE'S ME BUYERS ALSO ENSURED MANUFACTURERS AND PRODUCTS WERE ON THE FDA'S ESTABLISHMENT AND REGISTRATION DEVICE LISTINGS. BUYERS LEVERAGED HELLO YES IS HOMELAND SECURITY UNIT TO VET SUPPLIERS THAT REQUESTED UNUSUAL PAYMENT TERMS OR A VENDOR INFORMATION COULD NOT BE READILY VALIDATED. WE ALSO REACHED OUT TO OUR COUNTERPARTS ARE BECOMING COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES TO IDENTIFY EXPERIENCES THEY WERE HAVING WITH SIMILAR VENDORS. BUYERS THE NEGOTIATED WITH VENDORS ON PRICING PAYMENT TERMS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AND PURCHASE WORK PURCHASES WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER IN MOST INSTANCES INSTANCES BEFORE EXECUTION OF THAT PURCHASE. IF ANY OF THESE EVALUATIONS. WERE UNSUCCESSFUL THE BY WAS DECLINED. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF AVAILABLE PP CAPACITY WITHIN THE U. S. MOST OF THE PURCHASES WERE COMING FROM CHINA. MANY OF THESE WERE DEALERS OR BROKERS WHO ARE OFTEN ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES BUT NOT FORMALLY IN THE BUSINESS OF SELLING PP. CALIFORNIA COULD NOT GET ADEQUATE ACCESS TO CHINESE MANUFACTURERS TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THEM DIRECTLY. AS AN ALL STATE CONTRACTS THE VENDOR WAS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE PROCUREMENT FROM EXECUTION OF THE PURCHASE ORDER TO FINAL DELIVERY AN INSPECTION AT STATE WAREHOUSES. WHILE THE STATE WORK WITH VENDORS ENSURE PRODUCTS WERE PROVIDED AS COMMITTED TO VENDORS THAT COULD NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS HAD THEIR PURCHASE ORDERS TERMINATED OKAY IF YOU COULD DATE THE STATE HAS TERMINATED A TOTAL OF FIFTY THREE PURCHASE ORDERS. MICHELLE IF YOU COULD WRAP UP THAT BE GREAT IT WILL DOUBLE SURE WE WILL GET TO YOU GET FRESHEN. THANK YOU MUCH THANK YOU. I WE HAVE NOW. DIRECTOR MEDICAL WHICH. THANK YOU ARE- CHAIRMAN HOWARD GRAY AND CHAIRMAN CHANG IT'S A PLEASURE TO SPEAK WITH FOR YOU AND I'LL MAKE THIS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE I SIMPLY WANT TO ELABORATE ON MY COLLEAGUES- WORK THERE. THAT THEY DID IN THE PROCUREMENT SIDE HOUSEHOLD HERE AND THAT'S JUST PART OF THIS JOURNEY THAT WE ENGAGED IN. WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WOULD NOT ONLY BE BOUGHT THIS TO WE WERE HOW'S IT HOW DO WE DISTRIBUTED HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR. AND HOW DO WE SUPPORT ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS- TOGETHER IN A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH. WORKING TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY WITH NOT JUST WITH OUR STATE AGENCY PARTNERS BUT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS- OUR FEDERAL. PARTNERS AS WELL SO. ALL THIS IS A BEEN IN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING- BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT- WE HAVE OVERCOME THOSE OBSTACLES. AND PUT US IN A GREAT POSITION GOING INTO THIS NEXT WAVE- THOSE SHORTAGES THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN PP. 95% OF THOSE OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN PURCHASED AND PROCURED VETERANS STOCKPILE NOW. AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE LINE ITEM. WERE IN A VERY GOOD POSITION GOING INTO THE NEXT WAVE AND TO SUPPORT THE FLU- THE PROJECT SHELL TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE VETTED THESE THIS PROCESS BUT WE DID THIS. IN A TIMELY MANNER WITH. OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND. VENDORS AND FOLKS THAT WANTED TO COME TO US TO ACTUALLY- EITHER SELL THEIR GOODS OR PROVIDE DONATIONS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- ALL THE STONE WAS METHODICALLY DELIBERATELY. AND DONE IN A WAY TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY OF FOR ALL INVOLVED. I DO WANT TO SAY. THAT WE NOW ARE. A DISTRIBUTING- APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ITEMS A DAY IF YOU LOOK BACK ON THE HISTORY OF THE SITE- PANDEMIC WITH US WHEN WE MOVED OVER EIGHT OR NINETY THREE MILLION PIECES OF PP. TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES A WITH A THE STATE OF. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASKED WAS HOW DO WE WORK SCARCE RESOURCES AND I WANTED TO ELABORATE THAT WE DO THAT THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL A MULTI AGENCY COORDINATION GROUP. IT'S ESTABLISHED IT'S METHODICAL AS WELL THE USES A MATRIX IT'S MADE UP OF MULTIPLE MEMBERS AND THEY GO THROUGH AND LOOK AT A REQUEST IN DETAIL IN ADJUDICATE AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES WHEN THEY BECOME SCARCE. FOR FORTUNATE NOW THAT THAT- MAC GROUP HAS BEEN DEMOBILIZED THAT'SBECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ADDRESS SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS- IN OUR SYSTEM. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO GO TO MISS PETERS MISS PETERS WITH OIL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- I'LL BE BRIEF IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- IT WITH REGARD THE PP IS SIMILAR TO THE STATE'S OVERALL EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES ADMINISTRATION HAS CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY TO PROCURE. SUPPLIES AS IT RESPONDS TO EMERGENCIES. ON ANTI DO THINGS SUCH AS- SUSPENDING. EXISTING CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT I'M REGULATIONS AND LAWS TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO THE MINISTRATION. I'M AND SO WE HAVE JUST PUT TOGETHER SOME OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO ASKING YOUR REMAINING TIME ON FUTURE I'M HEARINGS. I'M LOOKING AT THE OVERSIGHT OF PP. SO AND IN THE INFORMATION. THAT I AM HAS BEEN BETWEEN. LAST YEAR AND PLANNED FOR THIS YEAR AN ESTIMATED FOUR PP. AND OTHER SUPPLY PROCUREMENT. IT'S UNCLEAR FROM THAT HOW MUCH IS FOR PP VERSUS OTHER TYPES OF SUPPLIES. AND SO EVEN JUST GETTING THAT AND SENSE OF A NUMBER OF WHITE WHAT EXACTLY AND HOW IS THE FUNDING AMOUNT FOR PP WILL BE IMPORTANT. HOW MUCH HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT VERSUS HOW MUCH IS PLANNED TO BE SPENT. ON AND WHAT AND WHAT DOES THE STATE HOPES TO ACHIEVE WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THAT IT HAS ESTIMATED FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. IN TERMS OF- NUMBER OF SUPPLIES AND TYPES OF SUPPLIES. HOW DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE CURRENT DEMAND FOR PP. I'M AND- I'M HOW HAS THE PP THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED AND DISTRIBUTED VERSUS HOW- ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I'M REALLY HOW REQUEST FOR PP ARE BEING EVALUATED AND PRIORITIZED- WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF SUPPLY AND IF THE SUPPLIES. CAN'T ARE UNABLE TO MEET TIME DEMANDS IF THERE'S REALLY GREAT DEMAND FOR PP. I'M HOW OLD PRIORITIZATION BE MADE. HAVE ANY REQUESTS. FOR PP BEEN DENIED TO DATE. I'M THANK. LIKE AND LIKE I SAID THE- AND- PP PROCUREMENT LIKE OTHER KIND. AWARDED DURING EMERGENCY CAN BE EXEMPTED FROM REGULAR CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER WERE AT THIS STAGE OF THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE WHERE THE MINISTRATION DOES HAVE MORE TIME TO PLAN. FOR ITS ACTIVITIES AND SO WHAT TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE STATE FOLLOWING REGULAR CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS. OR TRYING TO INCORPORATE ELEMENTS OF THOSE SUCH AS COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. I'M INTO ITS PURCHASE OF PP NOW THAT THERE'S MORE TIME TO PLAN FOR THESE PURCHASES. ON AND AGAIN WELL IT'S NOT REQUIRED BY STATE LAW- IS THE ADMINISTRATION GOING TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE IN ADVANCE OF MAJOR PP PURCHASE SAYS SO AT THAT THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S- PLANS ARE. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. THANK YOU. I WON'T NEED TO LEAVE IN A FEW MINUTES ARE GOING TO TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO MISTER GRAY WHO I THINK HAS SOME OPENING QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU- TO THE PANEL AND OUR PANELISTS FOR. BEING HERE WITH US TODAY. I WANT TO TOUCH FOR A MINUTE ON THE FOR FROM WHAT I UNDERSTOOD THEIR SUPPLY RESTRAINTS. HAVE BEEN RELIEVED. NOW IS THAT APPLIED JUST. TO P. P. E. AS AND MASKS AND GLOVES SUTTER- WHERE WE AT ON TE DISCUSSION AROUND FOR EXAMPLE VENTILATORS AND HOSPITAL CAPACITY RIGHT AND ARE WE PROPERLY UTILIZING- MAYBE KIND OF A BREAK IN THE ACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA FACE SIMILAR ISSUES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE- WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. OF ANYTHING. THEY START THEIR. I THINK THAT WOULDBE A GOOD QUESTION TO DIRECT TO- YES AND EGS IN TERMS OF THEIR PLANNING ACTIVITIES FOR ADDITIONAL- PEACE OF MIND. WELL PERHAPS WE CAN HEAR FROM- DEPUTY DIRECTOR THEY GIVE EACH. YES THANK YOU ADJOURNMENT- SO WE WORK HAND IN HAND IN CONCERT WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ON ANY THE MODELING THAT THEY HAVE AS WELL AS LOOKING BACKWARDS INTO WHAT. THE TOTAL NUMBERS OF COMMODITIES AND TYPES THAT WE DISTRIBUTED OUR PREVIOUSLY- IN IN THE PAST WAVE AND NEEDS TO FAX GIVE US OF PLANNING TARGET AND WHAT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS- SO I WILL SAY IS THAT- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH A METRIC AND THEN BY IN STOCKPILE TO THAT METRIC. SO THAT WE PUT OURSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE- SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES TO PUSH THROUGH THIS NEXT WAVE- THE ONLY- THAT WE'VE RECENTLY BEEN EXPERIENCING ANY CHALLENGES HAS BEEN AND GLOVES THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AGGRESSIVELY ON IT'S NOT THAT IT'S HURTING US. IN OUR ABILITY TO. MAINTAIN THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION IT IS NOT THAT IT HAS NOT MET OUR TARGET FOR LONG TERM STOCKPILING WITH THE ADVENT OF SB TWO SEVENTY FIVE WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO AND SEE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS. A PANDEMIC THAT WILL IMMEDIATELY ROLL OVER INTO THAT STOCKPILE AND PREPARES FOR ANY OTHER FUTURE HAZARD OR EMERGENCY THAT MAY TAKE PLACE- IN TERMS OF A VENTILATOR SO WHICH WAS BROUGHT UP- WE'VE ALSO PROCURED VENTILATORS ON BEHALF OF- EMSA. AND HAVE DONE SO IN A POSITION TO MEET OUR TARGETS THERE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT VIOLATORS- AND WE'VE ALSO PROCURED NECESSARY SUPPLIES TO BILLS SURGE CAPACITY FOR HOSPITALS THAT ARE. WOULD BE A PORTABLE IN NATURE WE WOULD ESTABLISH IN COLOCATION OF FOR THAT SURGE CAPACITY SO ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE LOGISTICS AND COMMODITY TASK FORCE IT'S A MULTI AGENCY TASK FORCE AND WE WERE CAN HEAD TOGETHER- TO DO THAT- I'M GONNA. LET A DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHALL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION REGARDING- PRICING AND. HOW THAT DOES WORK THERE SO STAND BY. THANK YOU. SO WITH RESPECT TO- THE PLAN GOING FORWARD- WE ARE WORKING ON A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENTS AT THIS TIME- WE'RE CURRENTLY EVALUATING FOR AWARD A COMPETITIVE MULTIPLE VENDOR PROCUREMENT FOR AND NINETY FIVE AND SURGICAL MASKS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL SUPPLY- THIS ITEM FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND UP TO TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE STOCK- ON HAND NEEDED TO RESPOND TO ANY THE CONTINUANCE OF THIS EVENT OR ANY FUTURE EVENTS THAT COME UP- WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON OTHER AREAS IN LOOKING AT GOING BACK TO. OUR COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT METHODS RECOGNIZING THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS AN EMERGENCY- PROCUREMENT OPERATION AND WE WANT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT AND GET BACK TO OUR NORMAL PROCUREMENT OPERATIONS. LET ME GO DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER AND- I WORK BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE VETTING THAT THERE WERE SOME REFERENCE TO. BROKERS AND SPECIFICALLY THE NEED TO ACQUIRE. SUPPLIES FROM OVERSEAS AND- THAT KIND OF THE BIGGEST COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING POST PANDEMIC OR OR IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC TO- FOR SURE THAT WE'RE NOT OVERLY RELIANT OVERSEAS IN THERE IS MANUFACTURING ON. THE SUPPLIES AND OTHER THINGS AND IMAGE FINDER ACCOUNTABLE WHAT WHAT THE- PROTOCOLS WERE. OUR SAFETY MEASURES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE- IN AROUND BROKERS FOR EXAMPLE COULD A BROKER YOU GET A CONTRACT WITH THE STATE TO ACQUIRE PP FROM CHINA AND AT THE SAME TIME- CONTRACT PP FROM. YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES AND THEN WHEN THE- SUPPLIES COME IN FROM CHINA JUST TAKE A WALK ON THE COMPANY THAT THEY PROCURED HERE LOCALLY- DO WE HAVE ANY OVERSIGHT THAT AREA BECAUSE IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE OUR RELATIONSHIP IS. MORE SAY EXCLUSIVELY BUT PRIMARILY WITH THE BROKER AND WHATEVER'S HAPPENING WITH THE SUPPLIERS- WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE NOT A CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR IS THAT A FAIR COMMENT. WE WHO WE CONTRACTED WITH ALL ALL START WITH WITHOUT LAST PORTION OF THE QUESTION. THE STATE. CONTRACTS WITH A SINGLE VENDOR- OR UNDER NORMAL PROCUREMENT OPERATIONS ARE ALLOWED TO BE JOINT VENTURES AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS- BUT IN THIS THIS EMERGENCY PANDEMIC WE ARE CONTRACTED WITH A SINGLE VENDOR THAT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A BROKER- BUT OUR EXPECTATION WAS THAT THAT. BROKER OR THAT BUSINESS ENTITY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL FACETS OF THE OPERATION FROM A SUBMITTING THE QUOTE TO IDENTIFYING THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY CUSTODY TO ENSURING THAT- THE GOODS WERE DELIVERED- TIMELY- TO THE LOCATION THAT WAS REQUESTED- INVOICES WERE SUBMITTED AND PAYMENTS WERE MADE- AND SO. TRADITIONALLY THE STATE AGAIN CONTRACTS WITH A SINGLE VENDOR AND IF THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO- THE FURTHER SUPPLY CHAIN AT THE STATE DOES ATTEMPT TO WORK WITH THOSE THOSE WHAT WE WOULD CALL PRIME VENDORS TO ENSURE. THAT THE PAYMENTS ARE BEING MADE VENDORS ARE BEING YOU KNOW RESPONSIBLE AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS- BUT AGAIN OUR OUR CONTRACT IS WITH- THAT SINGLE VENTURE VENDOR WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND IN THE CASE. BACK TO YOU KNOW WILL NOT RUNNING FOR STATISTICALLY RELIABLE DOWN OF NO I'M SORRY GIVEN INTERRUPTER AND ECHO FOR YOU'RE SAYING MAKE. TO WORK WITH SUPPLIERS BUT IN THE CASE WHERE. A CALIFORNIA COMPANY- CAME FORWARD SAID HEY YOU KNOW YOU GUYS CONTENT VENDORS THEY CONTRACT WITH ME THEY DIDN'T PAY ME- IS THERE ANY RECOURSE. FOR THAT COMPANY UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS. AGAIN BECAUSE THE STATE IS CONTRACTING DIRECTLY WITH A C. VAN THAT IS WHERE OUR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP LIES AND SO. IF WE HAD INSTANCES WHERE THERE WERE A LOT LOWER TIERED SUPPLY CHAIN VENDORS INDICATING THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN PAID WE IMMEDIATELY WORKED WITH THAT PRIME VENDOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE TAKING CARE OF. ALL OF THE VENDORS IN THE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENT AND ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE COME UP. OKAY THANK YOU. AND THEN ONE LAST QUESTION NUMBER TO MOVE ON IT MEMBERS- WHAT'S THE PROCESS. FOR VETTING THOSE. BROKERS. SO AS I TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT EARLIER IN LOOKING AT VETTING WE HAD SEVERAL STEPS THAT WE USED- IN TERMS OF VETTING OUR VENDORS- AND YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT THE INFORMATION. SUCH AS A CHAIN OF CUSTODY- YOU KNOW WHERE THEY IN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS EITHER IN OUR CURRENT OF FISCAL SYSTEM THE FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEM- IF NOT WERE THEY WHEN THEY SUBMITTED A- PAY DATA STATEMENT- DID IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR BUSINESS INFORMATION WAS WAS THERE A FEDERAL TAX ID- YOU KNOW WAS THERE A NON YOU KNOW TAT WHICH WOULD STILL BE A FEDERAL TAX ID BUT YOU KNOW SO SECURITY NUMBER VERSUS A AND F. B. I. AND- YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE TYPE OF BUSINESS ENTITY WORTHY IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE PORTAL- IF THEY WERE OUT OF STATE BY WERE WE ABLE TO VALIDATE IN OTHER STATES. SIMILAR PORTALS THAT YOU KNOW THEY WERE A REGISTERED BUSINESS IF THEY WERE OUT OF COUNTRY WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO GET DOCUMENTATION TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS IN AND OUT OF COUNTRY ELEMENT AS WELL- A LOT OF THESE ENTITIES THAT WE DID BUSINESS WITH- MAY HAVE BEEN BROKERS BUT THEY WERE ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES- BUT THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE PPP BUSINESS A LOT OF VENDOR STEPPED UP. TO TRY AND ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF NOT JUST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THE NATION AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL AND SO THIS STATE HAD TO DEAL WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF VENDORS THAT WE HAD NOT HEARD OF BEFORE SO WE DID DO THAT VETTING PROCESS AND WE DID MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THIS VENDOR- YOU TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTRACT AND BY AND LARGE WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT YEAH WE DID HAVE SOME VENDORS AS I STATED EARLIER THAT WE HAD TO TERMINATE. BUT IT WAS MOSTLY BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY COULDN'T MEET THE DELIVERY DEADLINES THAT WERE SO CRITICAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY COULDN'T MEET THEM BECAUSE THE SITUATION IN THE- THE SUPPLY CHAIN WAS JUST UNHEARD OF IT WAS IT WAS PEOPLE YOU KNOW SELLING OUT GOODS UNDERNEATH EACH OTHER IT WAS SUCH LIMITED SUPPLY- AND YOU HAD ASKED EARLIER AND ALL ALL ALL AND WITH THIS BUT YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT WHAT THE STATE WAS DOING TO TRY AND- AWAY FROM USING OUT OF COUNTRY- OR YOU KNOW JUST RELYING SOLELY ON CHINA. AND WE DID WORK WITH SEVERAL COMPANIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS AT- YES- AND GO BASE TO. SEE IF WE COULDN'T GET OTHER MANUFACTURERS OR VENDORS TO STEP UP AND RETOOL THEIR OPERATIONS. OR START SELLING- PP AND WE DID HAVE SOME INSTANCES. WHERE WE HAD OAKLEY STEP UP AND START PRODUCING FACIALS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HAD A COMPANY OUT OF LOS ANGELES YOU STRIVE. THAT STEPPED UP AND RETOOL THEIR OPERATION TO MAKE A CLOTH FACE MASKS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SO. WE DID HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU- THIS TIME REMOVED TO. A CELL NUMBER COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DEMAND EXCEEDS SUPPLY PP. IS THERE A PRIORITIZATION PLAN FOR PP DISTRIBUTION. AND WILL LEGISLATURE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT PLAN. YEAH I THANK YOU A MEMBER GRAVERT I WOULD SAY THAT- I KNOW HOPE IS NOT A METHOD BUT WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO FOR SELF THE POSITION I THINK WE'VE TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES IN OUR STOCKPILE- TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING- WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH LEGISLATURE- IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS- BUT RIGHT NOW LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE USE THAT MULTI AGENCY COORDINATION GROUP THE MAC GROUP. OF THAT LITERALLY TAKES A VERY DEEP DIVE WHEN REQUEST COMES IN AND ENSURES THAT THE REQUEST IS NOT A PADDED ANYWAY AS CRITICALITY- THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT REQUEST IS PROPERLY JUDICATA AND BY DOING SO THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OR GOOD DISTRIBUTION TO THAT TO THAT GROUP TO MEET THE- THE NEEDS OF CRITICALITY THAT NEEDS- AND THAT'S THAT'S CURRENT METHODOLOGY IS BEING USED IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO DATE- THERE ARE AND WITH THAT OF COURSE MEANS THAT A REQUEST YOU KNOW MAY COME IN TO BE REDUCED- TO MEET THEIR MOST CRITICAL FUNCTIONS ARE NEEDS MAYBE IT'S YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A THIRTY DAY SUPPLY. YOU GET A TWO WEEK SUPPLY OR MAYBE MEANS WE'LL GET A TO EXPLOIT WE GET A ONE WEEK SUPPLY WHILE  HANDLE OTHER CRITICAL AREAS. WOOD MISTER. OKAY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. WITH THAT ALL THANK OUR PANELISTS FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S HEARING- PRECIADO- NOT ALL YOUR ANSWERS TODAY BUT ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO ON BEHALF OF ALL THE NUMBERS.

WHERE ILLNESSES THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THESE TRIALS. PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WITHOUT MONTH SO YOU'RE GOING TO MANDATE A VACCINE. THAT'S NOT TESTED ON THE PEOPLE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE USED ON ANY MANDATE OF A COVERT VACCINE WOULD VIOLATE BODILY AUTONOMY. THIS IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY PEOPLE WHO DISSENT FOR SPEAK OUT ARE NOT GIVEN RESPECT AND ARE BEING CENSORED. WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT OF USING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST THE PEOPLE THEY ARE MEANT TO PROTECT. THE FORCED A VACCINE WITH ZERO LIABILITY I JUST IMPLORE USED ALL TO ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS.

ONE BIG JOKE OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AS ARE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS I SEE WHAT. WE CAN REFRAIN FROM YELLING IN THE CHAMBERS WILL GET TO THE FOLKS THAT WANT TO TESTIFY. HI HI GUYS I ENJOYED HEARING ME BUDGETING THE DISCUSSION OF BUDGETING- I JUST WONDER WHY DO WE NOT TALK ABOUT EIGHTEEN U. S. CODE TEN THIRTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN U. S. CODE TEN THIRTY EIGHT DEALS WITH FALSE INFORMATION AND HOAXES. IT TALKS ABOUT HOW IF INFORMATION PRESENTED. HAS A REASON TO BE BELIEVED LIKE. STATEWIDE MASS GUIDANCE- AND LOCKDOWNS FOR INSTANCE. BUT IS FALSE IN NATURE YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED FOR YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY LYING. MINIMUM YOU CAN BE FINED OR IMPRISONED IN PRISON FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS OR BOTH. IF BODILY HARM. IS CAUSED BY THE MISINFORMATION. THE SENTENCE GOES FROM FIVE YEARS TO TWENTY YEARS. SO LIKE THE PEPLE PASSING OUT FOR WEARING THE MASKS THE PEOPLE COMMITTING SUICIDE. OR THAT LOVELY FUTURE VACCINE THAT YOU GUYS CAN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT. LASTLY IT DOES OCCUR DURING THE VIOLATION OF CODE TEN THIRTY EIGHT YOU CAN EARN A LIFE SENTENCE IN PRISON. OH WAIT I REMEMBER THOSE SUICIDES THAT I MENTIONED UNDERNEATH OF SERIOUS BODILY HARM AND THE TWENTY YEAR IMPRISONMENT THAT'S PROBABLY BELONGS HERE NO PROBABLY BELONGS HERE IN MY OPINION SPREADING FALSE INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF A PANDEMIC SOUNDS LIKE TO THOSE THAT HAVE TAKEN THEIR LIVES THOSE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD LIKE ME THAT HAVE KILLED THEMSELVES IN THE LAST. EIGHT MONTHS. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HE'S ASSISTING THEM TO KILL THEMSELVES IF THEY'RE TERRIFIED OF SOMETHING THAT ISN'T HAPPENING. HOW MUCH SO HOW MUCH MONEY MY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO BUDGET FOR THIS. WHY ISN'T IT ON THE HANDOUTS HERE WHY IS IT ON THEIR OWN. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHY AREN'T YOU ALL IN HERE EVERY SINGLE ONE YOU BUY THE TABLE WHY AREN'T YOU IN HANDCUFFS FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IS GLOBAL SCANDAL. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND WHAT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BUDGET FOR IT. THANK YOU. OKAY WITH THAT WE'VE CONCLUDED OUR PUBLIC TESTIMONY TODAY. I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT YOU CAN SUBMIT ADDITIONAL COMMENTS VIA EMAIL WILL GIVE- THAT OPPORTUNITY ONE WHO WASN'T ABLE TO SPEAK IN TODAY WITH THAT MEMBERS OF THE- COMMITTEE MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
