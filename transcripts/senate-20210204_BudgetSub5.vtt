REQUEST IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:05.631
WITH THE WORKERS COMP COSTS AND

BENEFITS AS WELL SO THERE ARE

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:15.173
BASED ON DATA THAT OF

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.541
ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.276
WORKERS COMP CLAIMS THAT WOULD

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.812
BE FILED EACH YEAR AND THEY

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:22.581
LOOKED AT ME MINOR MODERATE AND

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:25.250
SEVERE CASES- TO COME UP WITH

TO THE TWENTY SEVEN

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:34.359
POSSESSIONS. SO THE REASON THAT

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:37.496
THIS IS A MULTI YEAR PROPOSAL

00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:39.197
IS BECAUSE THEIR NEW CLAIMS

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:44.169
THAT WILL BE FILED EACH YEAR-

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:46.271
ONCE. EVEN AFTER A CLAIM IS

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.407
FILED THEIR DISABILITY PAYMENTS

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:51.443
THAT WILL OCCUR IN ADDITION IT.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.111
AND AN EMPLOYEE NEEDS TO GET TO

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:55.447
THEIR MAXIMUM MEDICAL

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:57.215
IMPROVEMENT BEFORE LEGAL

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:59.551
SETTLEMENT OCCURS WHICH CAN

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:00.952
TAKE UP TO THREE AND A HALF

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:02.454
YEARS SO IT'S A LENGTHY

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.256
PROCESS. SO THERE WILL BE

00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:06.358
EXPENDITURES YEAR OVER YEAR BUT

00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:10.562
IT IS IT A TEMPORARY FUNDING.

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:11.430
AND ALL DEFERRED TO THE

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:12.998
DEPARTMENT- IF THEY'D LIKE TO

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:21.940
ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. OKAY I

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:24.609

YOU'RE ASKING FOR- EXPLAINED A

00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:37.889
LITTLE BIT MORE. BECAUSE WE

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:40.325
DON'T KNOW THE IMPACT WE DON'T

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:42.794

PLEASE. I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS

00:22:57.242 --> 00:22:58.744
JANELLE BROWN FROM CITY SIR

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.178
WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD SIX

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:03.148
MONTHS OF DATA- BETWEEN MARCH

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:05.117

OF DATA WAS RECEIVED BY US AND

00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.731
STATE FUNDS SO WE USE THAT DATA

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:22.267
TO EXTRAPOLATE- THE NUMBER OF

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:23.568

OR TWO YEARS- THAT IS COVERED

00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:30.041
BY THE STATUTE. AND THEN

00:23:30.108 --> 00:23:30.976
BECAUSE THE NORMAL AVERAGE

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:51.589
IT'S- INCUMBENT ON US TO GET

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:53.457
THE MAXIMUM SAVINGS THAT WE

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.292
SHOULD COME UP WITH A PLAN. SO

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:57.094
THAT WE COULD GET THE SAVINGS

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:59.330
AND MOVE ON TO A GREATER AND

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:01.465
BETTER USE OF THE FACILITIES

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:03.434
SO. I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO GET

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:05.503
THE ANSWER BUT- HOW DO WE COME

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:09.173
UP WITH THE- WHO. ON WHO'S GOT

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.242
THE RESPONSIBILITY. TO COME UP

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:13.844
WITH THE PLAN. BOB ON THE ON

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:15.613
THE LAND IN THE FACILITY AFTER

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.148
IT'S BEEN CLOSED I COULD JUST

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.883
SEE THE SORT OF. HANGING OUT

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:20.851
THERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.953
WERE WASTED A LOT OF MONEY. ANY

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.156
THOUGHTS FROM ANYBODY ON WHERE

00:40:25.222 --> 00:40:29.160
THIS ENDS UP AS FAR AS THE PLAN.

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:30.728
AFTER THE CLOSURE TO MAKE SURE

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:34.799
IT'S A CLOSER. I THINK HE WOULD

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:36.367
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING JUST TO

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:37.668
WAIT A LITTLE BIT SENATOR

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.570
DORADO. RESTRICTION DOESN'T

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:40.871
HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PLAN AT THIS

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:42.673
MOMENT THE ONE THING WE WANTED

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.108
TO FLAG IS THAT THERE IS A

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.743
NUMBER OF USES OF THIS FACILITY

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.744
IN THE LAND AND THAT NEEDS TO

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.345
BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

00:40:48.412 --> 00:40:50.147
MOVING FORWARD. PARTICULARLY AT

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:51.148
THE MOMENT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:52.216
THINGS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IS

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:53.617
KIND OF SPACE CONSTRAINTS AND

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.920
HOW WE UTILIZE SPACE AND IF

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:56.754
THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES I THINK

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.455
IT'S ONE OF THE IF. IT'S

00:40:58.522 --> 00:40:59.089
SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.724
AT IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.026
DISPOSITION FOR THE PROPERTY IS

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:04.161
AS WE SAID WE CAN'T AND THERE'S

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:05.596
NO PLAN AT THIS POINT OTHER

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:06.730
THAN MAINTAINING THE FACILITY

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:08.098
IN ONE SHOT DOWN BUT WE NEED TO

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:09.200
BE VERY THOUGHTFUL I THINK.

00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:10.901
MOVING FORWARD ABOUT WHAT WE

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:14.138
END UP DOING WITH THE FACILITY-

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:15.673
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MAXIMIZE

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:16.740
THE USE OF THE FACILITY IN THE

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:19.443

CERTAINTY THERE BUT- REGARDLESS

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:43.594

ULTIMATE DISPOSITION- DVI OR

00:43:28.405 --> 00:43:30.307

ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.928
MORE AND THE POPULATION IS

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:28.232
CURRENTLY VERY LOW AND TO

00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:29.600
ENSURE AWARE DUE TO. AB

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:31.368
RESPONSES THAT THE STATE HAS

THE PRISONS. SUCH AS THAT

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:37.174
DEFICIT SPENDING THAT INTAKE

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:39.343
FROM COUNTY JAILS. AND THOSE

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.045
ARE TEMPORARY MEASURES THAT

WILL EAT- BE REMOVED

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:47.317
EVENTUALLY. HOWEVER PREVIOUSLY

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.086
ENACTED AND PLANNED POLICY

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:51.555
CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE

00:44:51.622 --> 00:44:53.257
THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT INMATES

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:54.958
ARE REQUIRED TO SPEND IN PRISON

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:58.028

00:44:58.095 --> 00:44:59.897
POLICY CHANGES TAKE HOLD

00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:01.698
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BRING TO

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:02.866
PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE

00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:05.169
INMATE POPULATION SUCH THAT

EVEN AFTER THE TEMPERING CODE

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:09.573
RELATED MEASURES GO AWAY THE

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.008
POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO MAIN

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:12.776
RELATIVELY LOW REACHING AROUND

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:16.080
A HUNDRED THOUSAND BY TWENTY

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:17.314
TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS A COUPLE

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:19.650
TENS OF THOUSANDS LOWER THAN

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:23.353
PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. AND SO.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.422
PREVIOUS INMATE POPULATION

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:26.490
DECLINES HAVE BEEN ACCOMMODATED

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.358
BY REMOVING INMATES FROM

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:30.461
CONTRACT PRISONS BUT THE STATE

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.895
IS ON THE VERGE OF REMOVING THE

FINAL INMATES FROM CONTRACT

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:34.765
PRISONS THIS YEAR SO GOING

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:37.568
FORWARD- WHEN DECLINES

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:39.470
ACCUMULATE TO THE SIZE OF A

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.271
FROM TWO OF THE- CAPACITY OF

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:42.206
ONE PRISON ESSENTIALLY THE

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:43.273
STATE COULD ACCOMMODATE THE

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.476
DECLINE BY CLOSING PRISONS. AND

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:46.877
GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.278
DECLINE THAT'S PROJECTED WE

00:45:48.345 --> 00:45:50.647
ESTIMATE THAT THE STATE COULD

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:51.915
CLOSE AROUND FIVE PRISONS. OVER

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:53.550
THE NEXT THREE YEARS- THOUGH

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:54.718
THE ACTUAL AMOUNT COULD BE

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.453
HIGHER OR LOWER DEPENDING ON

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.589
THE SPECIFIC FACILITIES. THAT

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:01.191
ARE CHOSEN AND THE AND THE

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.393
CAPACITY OF THOSE FACILITIES.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.128
YOUR MEN I BELIEVE YOUR SECOND

00:46:04.194 --> 00:46:08.265
QUESTION. WAS HOW THE STATE CAN

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:10.434
INSURE THAT IT'S ON IT STAYS ON

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.936
A PATH TO CLOSING THESE PRISONS

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:16.907
WAS THAT CORRECT YES YES. SO S.

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:19.176
S. SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF THE

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:20.577
POPULATION DECLINE THAT'S

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:23.847
PROJECTED IS. HE PLANNED BUT

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:27.317
NOT YET IMPLEMENTED- EXPANSION

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:29.786
TO INMATE. TWO CREDITS WHICH

00:46:29.853 --> 00:46:32.756
ARE- TIME THAT INMATES CAN EARN

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:33.891
OFF THEIR PRISON SENTENCE FOR

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.526
MAINTAINING GOOD BEHAVIOR WHILE

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:39.329
INCARCERATED. AND THAT- WAS

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:40.864
SUPPOSED TO BE- WAS PLANNED TO

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:43.167
BE IMPLEMENTED JANUARY ONE OF

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:45.402
THIS YEAR BUT GIVEN THAT THE

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:47.271
ADMINISTRATION HAD TO SHIFT ITS

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:49.573
ATTENTION TO ADDRESSING COVET

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.075
THAT IMPLEMENTATION DATE HAS

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:55.212
BEEN PUSHED BACK TO MARCH- SO

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:56.780
TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT DATE

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:59.149
SLIPS FURTHER. THAT WOULD

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:01.652
LIKELY- IMPACT THAT POPULATION

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:03.387
DECLINING COULD DELAY THE

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:04.555
STATE'S ABILITY TO CLOSE A

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:05.689
PRISON SO ONE THING THE STATE

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:08.659
CAN DO IS SIMPLY- TRY TO

00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:09.693
PREVENT THAT IMPLEMENTATION

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.829
DATE FROM GETTING PUSHED

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:14.064
FURTHER BACK. AND THEN BEYOND

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.632
THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.534
POPULATION DECLINES DON'T

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:18.936
MATERIALIZE AS PROJECTED. THERE

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:21.338
ARE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:24.174
THE STATE HAS TO. PUT THE STATE

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:25.943
OR KEEP KEEP IT ON TRACK OF PUT

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.711
IT BACK ON TRACK TO CLOSING

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:28.912
THOSE PRESENTS AND THEY

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:30.047
GENERALLY FALL INTO THREE

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:32.649
CATEGORIES. THE FIRST IT WOULD

00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:35.219
BE TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:36.653
REDUCE THE INMATE POPULATION

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.922
WHICH- THAT COULD BE.

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:41.892
SENTENCING CHANGES FOR- OF

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:42.426
WHICH THERE'S A VARIETY OF

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.861
DIFFERENT OPTIONS. SECOND WOULD

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:47.998
BE TO HOUSE MORE INMATES. IN

00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:51.134
FACILITIES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:53.770
OWNED PRISONS FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:55.672
STATE COULD EXPAND YOU SAYS

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.241
IT'S ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY

00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:58.809
PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS CERTAIN

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:00.611
INMATES TO SPEND THE LAST YEAR

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:02.112
OF THEIR SENTENCE IN THE

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:03.814
COMMUNITY UNDER THE SUPERVISION

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.116
OF A PRO AGENT- AND THEN THE

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:08.819
THIRD OPTION WOULD BE TO.

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:11.888
REDUCE WIDER. I IS OFTEN CALLED

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:13.857
THE BUT FOR WHICH AND BY THAT I

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:16.593
MEAN THAT GIVEN A FEDERAL COURT

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.029
ORDER RELATED TO IN PRISON

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:21.231
OVERCROWDING THE STATE IS.

00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:23.767
LIMITED TO HOLDING NO MORE THAN

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:25.369
ABOUT A HUNDRED SIXTEEN

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:26.470
THOUSAND INMATES IN ITS STAND

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:30.307
STATE OWNED PRISONS. BUT AT

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:31.308
GIVEN THAT THERE CAN BE

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.210
FLUCTUATION IN THE POPULATION

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:35.779
THE STATE TYPICALLY SO IN PRE

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:39.983
CODE RED AND HOLDS- ARETE ABOUT

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.218
TWO THOUSAND INMATES FEWER THAN

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.519
THAT LIMIT IN ITS PRISONS IN

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.121
ORDER TO GIVE ITSELF SOME

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:46.089
BUFFER IN THE EVENT THAT THE

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:46.523
POPULATION INCREASES

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.725
UNEXPECTEDLY. SO ONE OPTION

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:51.795
WOULD BE TO SIMPLY HOT- OPERATE

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:54.865
A SMALLER BUFFER HOUSING SAME-

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.500
A THOUSAND INMATES FEWER THAN

00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:59.536
THE LIMIT- THE STATE WOULD

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:00.837
POTENTIALLY WANT TO HOWEVER

00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:03.006
TAKE OTHER ACTION TO MITIGATE

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:04.107
THE RISK OF VIOLATING THE COURT

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:05.876
ORDER. SUCH AS FORMING

00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:07.110
AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTY

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.779
SHERIFF'S TO DELAYED TRANSFER

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:10.580
OF INMATES IN THE EVENT THAT

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:14.685
THE POPULATION DOES APPROACH

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:17.287
THAT COURT ORDERED LIMIT. OKAY

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:17.854
EIGHT THOSE ARE GREAT

00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:19.056
SUGGESTIONS GREAT

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:21.758

FINANCE THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:33.503
RESPOND TO ADD TO THAT PART OF

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.105
THE ALLEY OWES RECOMMENDATION

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.707
SO AS WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:39.042
UNCERTAINTY CURRENTLY DUE TO

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.510
TEMPORARY POPULATION REDUCTION

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:43.246
AND JUST FUTURE ONGOING AB

00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:45.716
POPULATIONS ACTIONS IN THE

00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:48.118
EFFECTS OF KOVIN. M. CDCR NEEDS

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:49.486
TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:51.855
FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE THEIR

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:53.056
INSTITUTION POPULATION AS

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:54.691
SAFELY AS POSSIBLE DURING THE

00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:56.827
PANDEMIC AND EVEN AFTER THAT

00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:58.595
PANDEMIC SO THE ADMINISTRATION

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.564
BELIEVES IT'S- PREMATURE TO

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.299
IDENTIFY IT TIMELINE FOR FUTURE

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.934
PRISON PRISON CLOSURES BEYOND

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.170
THE SECOND CLOSURE PLAN FOR

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:07.671
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE.

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:09.439
ULTIMATELY THE POPULATION

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:10.674
CULVERTED AND OTHER FACTORS

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:13.176
WILL DICTATE. ANY FUTURE

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:15.412
CLOSURES BEYOND THAT SO

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:16.079
ALTHOUGH THE L. A. R. WAS

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:17.881
RECOMMENDING THREE ADDITIONAL

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.583
CLOSURES BEYOND THE TWO ALREADY

00:50:19.649 --> 00:50:21.351
PLANNED THEIR ADDITIONAL COURT

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:24.020
PRESSURES THAT EXIST THAT NEED

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:26.189
TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:27.557
EACH INSTITUTION CURRENTLY HAS

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:30.527
ISOLATION SPACE TO ALLOW. FOR

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:32.429
ANY OUTBREAKS OF COLD DEAD AND

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.830
EVEN ONCE EVERYONE IS

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:35.399
VACCINATED THERE COULD STILL BE

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:37.934
RISKS OF OTHER AIRBORNE ELLIS'S

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.636
WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO

00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:41.104
CONTAIN WITHIN A PRISON. SO

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:42.839
WE'RE STILL CONSIDERING

00:50:42.906 --> 00:50:44.241
DIFFERENT THE USE OF DIFFERENT

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:45.642
BANDS WHICH ARE POTENTIALLY

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.944
MORE AT RISK AND RIGHT NOW THE

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:49.379
COURTS ARE WATCHING AND LOOKING

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.847
AT HOW THESE ISSUES WILL BE

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:52.883
HANDED IN THE LONG TERM. SO

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:55.085
WERE RELUCTANT TO CLOSE ANY

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.520
ADDITIONAL PERSONS BEYOND THAT

00:50:56.586 --> 00:50:57.721
TO YOU BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.356
WHAT THE COURTS WILL DO SO

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:00.624
THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:05.495
MOVING FORWARD- JUST. BEYOND

CERTAINTY IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:24.514

ARCHING COMMENT AND

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.570
RECOMMENDATION THE FIRST

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:36.272
COMPONENT IS THE RESOURCES FOR

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:39.308
THE POST WHICH WE THINK WOULD

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.711
HELP THE DEPARTMENT AT OUR

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:43.546
EXCUSE ME SEACOAST BETTER MEET

IF LEGISLATIVE MANDATE SO WE DO

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:46.649
RECOMMEND APPROVING THOSE

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.618
RESOURCES BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:50.419
THAT THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:51.420
FACILITATE LEGISLATIVE

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.689
OVERSIGHT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:56.859
THE RESOURCES WOOD OUR HOPE HE

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.961
POST BETTER MONITOR METRICS

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:01.430
RELATED TO EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:03.532
AND TRAINING BUT THERE ISN'T A

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:06.002
PLAN TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.570
INFORMED OF THAT THOSE

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:10.940
FINDINGS. AND SO AND THIS IS OF

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:13.643
PARTICULAR CONCERN GIVEN THAT

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:17.913
THE- THERE'S BEEN SOME. I OF

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.982
VARIOUS PRISONS RELATED TO

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:23.286
STAFF MISCONDUCT- THAT COULD BE

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.187
TIED TO TRAINING DEFICIENCIES

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.022
SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:28.057
THE LEGISLATURE TO BE KEPT WELL

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:30.593

STAFF PERFORMANCE AND TRAINING.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:34.030
SO WE RECOMMEND PASSING TRAILER

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.865
BILL LEGISLATION REQUIRING C.

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:38.234
COST TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:40.636
LEGISLATURE BEGINNING JULY ONE

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.104
OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:44.540
RELEVANT DATA- CONCERNING

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.509
TRAINING OUTCOMES AND

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.543
CONCLUSIONS IT DRAWS FROM THE

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.145
DATA AS WELL AS- PLANS TO

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:52.048
ADDRESS ANY. CHALLENGES OR

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:54.917
CONCERNS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED.

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:55.918
THE SECOND COMPONENT APPROACH

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.520
OF THE PROPOSAL IS THE NEW

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:59.221
FACILITY FOR HANDS ON TRAINING

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.523
THAT WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:02.658
THE EXISTING ACADEMY FOR

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:03.359
TRAINING NEW CORRECTIONAL

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:05.194
OFFICERS AND WE THINK THAT

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:07.630
THIS- APPEARS WORTHWHILE TO

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:09.732
INSURING JEFF- THAT NEW

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:12.034
OFFICERS ARRIVE AT THEIR POSTS-

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:13.602
WELL PREPARED SO WE DO

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:15.338
RECOMMEND APPROVING IT. THE

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.006
THIRD COMPONENT IS THE NEW JOB

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:19.008
SHADOWING PROGRAM FOR OFFICERS

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:20.276
AFTER THEY GRADUATE FROM THE

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.877
CAN THE ACADEMY IN WHEN THEY

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:23.012
ARRIVE AT THE PRISON WHERE

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.747
WHERE THEY'LL BE WORKING.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.015
SIMILARLY TO THE HANDS ON

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.616
TRAINING FACILITY WE THINK THAT

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.352
THE GENERAL IDEA OF THIS ASPECT

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.153
OF THE PROPOSAL MAKES SENSE BUT

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.222
WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:35.157
SPECIFIC RESOURCES REQUESTED TO

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:37.360
SUPPORT IT- I WAS ALREADY

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:38.928
DISCUSSED WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.029
THE THIRTY THREE STARTING

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:41.097
POSITIONS SO I'LL JUST BE

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.666
BRIEF- SEVENTEEN OF THE

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.768
POSITIONS ARE RELATED TO THE-

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:46.535
WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:49.405
NEW JOB. SHADOWING PROGRAM BUT

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.140
THE REMAINING SIXTEEN ARE

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:54.176
DRIVEN BY IT AN INTENTION TO

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:56.846
RELIEVE EXISTING STAFF. OF

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:59.014
CERTAIN DUTIES SO THAT THEY CAN

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:00.883
FOCUS ON OTHER WORK THAT'S THE

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:03.619
DEPARTMENT REPORT ISN'T GETTING

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:05.087
DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:06.088
THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:08.424
TO. RIGHT ADEQUATE INFORMATION

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.393
TO JUSTIFY THE NEEDS FOR THOSE

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.928
SEVENTEEN POSITIONS- SO WE

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:14.196
WOULD EXPECT FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.765
DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE DATA

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.366
DEMONSTRATING THE EXTENT TO

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:20.803
WHICH WORKLOAD IS DELAYED AND-

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.538
A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:23.973
POSITIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.641
GET THAT WORK. DONE IN A TIMELY

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.743
MANNER. SO WE RECOMMEND

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:28.677
REJECTING THE SEVENTEEN

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:31.247
POSITIONS. AND ASSOCIATED TWO

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.415
POINT SEVEN MILLION IN ANNUAL

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:35.651
FUNDING. THE SECOND A RESOURCE

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.752
FOR THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.387
THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH IS

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.855
THE SIX POINT TWO MILLION TO

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:40.956
PAY THE NEW OFFICERS WHILE

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.358
THEY'RE ARTICIPATING IN THE

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.160
THREE WEEKS OF JOB SHADOWING.

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:45.494
AND NOT BECAUSE THAT NUMBER IS

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:46.662
BASED OFF AN ASSUMPTION THAT

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:50.166
CDCR WILL HAVE A ONE THOUSAND

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:50.699
EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:51.434
OFFICERS GOINGTHROUGH THE JOB

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.803
SHATTERING PROGRAM ANNUALLY BUT

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.204
AFTER DEVELOPING THE BCP THE

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.039
DEPARTMENT ASTON'S REVISED

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.340
THEIR ESTIMATE ON THE NUMBER OF

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:00.509
OFFICERS IT EXPECTS TO PRODUCE

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:03.446
IN THE BUDGET YEAR 210-004-0060

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.681
SIX. SO WE RECOMMEND REDUCING

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.584
THE FUNDING BY ONE POINT FOUR

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.352
MILLION TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS-

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:12.688
FEWER NUMBER OF OFFICERS THAT

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:16.192
ARE EXPECTED TO GO THROUGH THE

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:16.759
JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM IN THE

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.961
BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE MY

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.463
FINAL COMMENT IS AN OVERARCHING

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.731
ONE- AND THAT IS THAT PRISON

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:25.801
CLOSURES WILL REDUCE THE NEED

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.671
FOR NEW OFFICERS IN THE FUTURE-

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:30.406
IN THE YEARS WHEN. AROUND WHEN

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:31.841
THE PRISONS ARE CLOSED. AND

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.142
THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN A PRISON IS

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:35.110
CLOSED OFFICERS OUT THERE

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:36.245
PRISON HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:38.280
MOVE. TO FILL VACANCIES AT

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:39.715
OTHER PRISONS WHICH THEN

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.550
REDUCES THE NEED FOR CDC ARE

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:43.986
TO. PRODUCE NEW OFFICERS THERE

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:46.589
IT'S ACADEMY TO. FILL THOSE

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:50.025
VACANCIES. SO IN TYPICAL PEOPLE

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:55.030
ARE PAST YEARS- CCAR'S- NEED

01:08:55.097 --> 01:08:57.366
FOR NEW OFFICERS IS RELATIVELY

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.367
CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:00.102
AND SO IT'S BUDGET IS AN

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:01.704
ADJUSTED ANNUALLY BASED ON A

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.906
CHANGE IN THE NEED FOR NEW

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.342
OFFICERS BUT GIVEN THE

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.244
ANTICIPATED PRISON CLOSURES WE

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.912
THINK THAT THE EXISTING BASE

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.947
FUNDING AS WELL AS THE OUT YOUR

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:13.482
COMPONENTS OF FOR CERTAIN

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:14.016
ELEMENTS OF THE ARE YOUR

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:15.985
COMPONENTS- THAT ARE BEING

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.687
PROPOSED. HERE TODAY SUCH AS

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:21.757
THAT FUNDING FOR NEW OFFICERS

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:22.391
GOING THROUGH THE JOB SHADOWING

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:24.593
PROGRAM. WILL BECOME EXCESSIVE

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.296
SO WE RECOMMEND PASSING BUDGET

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.064
TRAILER LEGISLATION REQUIRING

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.399

OFFICERS. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS-

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.440

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:40.709
WAY THAT CDC ARE ALREADY

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:42.011

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:42.938
NOT CONVINCED THAT TRAILER BILL

LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY BUT WE

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.575
RESPECT THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:47.042

REASONABLE AS WELL AS ANY

POTENTIAL. FISCAL IMPACT OF

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:57.920
WHAT THAT MIGHT RESULT IN. IN

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.788
RESPONSE TO THE JOB SHADOWING

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:02.091
THE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:03.726
SERGEANTS. WE THINK IT'S

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:05.027
IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SERGEANT AT

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.862
EACH INSTITUTION DEDICATED TO

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.364
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JOB

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.965
SHADOWING PROGRAM EACH

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.100
INSTITUTION HAS A DIFFERENT

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.168
LAYOUT MISSION. INMATE

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:15.137
POPULATION AND ITS OWN UNIQUE

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.139
ATTRIBUTES SO WE THINK IT'S

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:18.941
CRITICAL FOR STAFF WHO OVERSEE

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.576
THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM TO

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:21.877
REALLY BE WELL VERSED IN THE

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.746
SPECIFICS OF THEIR INSTITUTION

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:24.747
SO THAT NEW CORRECTIONAL

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.415
OFFICERS REALLY RECEIVED THEIR

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:29.585
SITE SPECIFIC. TRAINING AND

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:30.753
THEY'LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:31.920
WORKING WITH THE STAFF TO

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:33.155
ENSURE THAT THE TRAINING IS

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.890

EXPERIENCE THERE. IN RESPONSE

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:44.800
TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE-

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.935
FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACADEMY

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.103
WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:49.571
CONSIDERADJUSTING THE OVERALL

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.874
ECONOMY RESOURCES THERE'S AND

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.375
NUMEROUS UNKNOWNS IN THE

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.743
FORESEEABLE FUTURE WHICH MAKES

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.645
IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THAT

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:57.546
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER IN THE

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.415
LONG TERM. THE ATTRITION RATE

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.183
ITSELF IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.451
FACTORS THERE'S BEEN ADDITIONAL

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:04.119
RETIREMENTS DUE TO COAL FED-

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.822
SALARY CHANGES AFFECT ATTRITION

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:09.391
AND JUST THE EFFECTS OF PRISON

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:10.125
PRISON CLOSURE IN THE FUTURE AS

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:12.795
WELL. SO EVEN IF THERE'S A

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:13.996
REDUCING IN THE SHORT TERM

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.631
THOUGH WILL BE CONTINUED

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:16.865
RETIREMENTS WHICH WILL NEED TO

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:19.568
BE BACK FELT. SO WE STILL NEED

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:20.803
THE ECONOMY INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.771
PLACE AS THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.773
TO BE READY FOR A LONGER TERM

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.875
CHANGES TO THEIR WORKFORCE.

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:28.110
HOWEVER WE WOULD CONSIDER

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.044
CONSOLIDATION WHEN IT'S

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:32.715
APPROPRIATE. BUT IT'S STILL

EXAMPLE I MIGHT. EXCEL AT

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:38.393
GEOMETRY BUT STRUGGLE WITH

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.696
ALGEBRA AND ANOTHER STUDENT

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:44.099
MIGHT. BE REALLY GOOD WITH-

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:45.634
ALGEBRA BUT REALLY STRUGGLE

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.636
WITH GEOMETRY. WITH THE LAPTOPS

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.571
WOULD DO IS IN THE CLASSROOM

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.606
ENVIRONMENT. ALLOW FOR OUR

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:53.241
TEACHERS TO PROVIDE TARGETED

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.876
INSTRUCTION TO THOSE STUDENTS.

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:57.112
OVER WHEN MOST OF THE CLASSROOM

01:16:57.179 --> 01:16:59.448
IS KIND OF READY TO MOVE ON TO

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:01.750
THE NEXT LASSEN. BUT A STUDENT

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:06.188
IS FEELING LIKE MAYBE. THEY

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:07.022
NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE PRACTICE.

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:07.656
A TEACHER WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:09.057
THE ADDITION PROBLEM THAT COULD

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:10.625
HAVE BEEN HEROES TOLD TO HELP

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.861
THEM. AND NOT IN THE CLASSROOM

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:13.829
WHERE THE TEACHER COULD BE

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:15.397
PROVIDING THEM WITH SUPPORT AND

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.865
FEEDBACK THINK OF IT KIND OF

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:19.201
LIKE A BREAKOUT GROUPS. AND TO

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.402
ALLOW FOR TARGETED INSTRUCTION

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.437
AND RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THOSE

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:23.405
DEVICES WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.974
THAT. ABILITY TO DO THAT KIND

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:26.742
OF TARGETED INSTRUCTION IN THE

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.810
SAME WAY. THIS WOULD DEFINITELY

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:30.012
SUPPORT OUR NEEDS IN THE

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:31.580
CLASSROOM HEY AND THEN THE

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.281
OTHER BIG BENEFIT IS THAT WOULD

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:34.950
ALLOW STUDENTS TO CONTINUE

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.018
THEIR LEARNING OUTSIDE OF THE

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:37.619
CLASSROOM. BUT WE CAN ASSIGN

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.187
ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS OR OR

01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:41.256
VIDEOS TO WATCH. SOMETHING YOU

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.691
CAN KIND OF FEEL LIKE HOMEWORK

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:44.693
OR ADDITIONAL PRACTICE PROBLEMS

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.227
THAT YOU MIGHT GET AND THE

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:47.062
COMMUNITY SCHOOL AND THAT WOULD

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:48.397
ALLOW STUDENTS SUPPORT THE

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:49.197
INSTRUCTION THAT THEY'RE

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:51.600
SEEING. FACE TO FACE AND ALLOW

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:52.968
THEM TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:55.470
KIND OF IN THEIR FREE TIME AND

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:56.171
WHERE THEY MIGHT WANT TO

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:58.373
CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH. THEIR

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.142
VARIOUS ASSIGNMENTS AND KIND OF

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:02.144
CONTINUE BUT BANDS WE THINK

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:02.878
THAT'LL REALLY HELP OUR

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:05.247
STUDENTS. AND I THINK THE OTHER

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:07.015
THING TO THINK ABOUT TOO IS.

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.117
FOR STUDENTS IN FEWEST YARDS

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:10.852
THERE'S A HUGE DIGITAL DIVIDE

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.754
RIGHT NOW. THEY DON'T HAVE

01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:14.523
ACCESS TO THE TYPE OF

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:15.724
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S REALLY

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.727
REQUIRED. FOR PROFESSIONAL WORK

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:19.761
WHEN STATE RETURN TO THEIR

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.763
COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE LAPTOPS

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:22.898
WILL REALLY HELP THEM TO BUILD

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.733
THOSE SKILLS THAT THEY'LL NEED

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.871
TO BE SUCCESSFUL ONCE. THEY

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:30.472
RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. I

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:30.972
HOPE THAT ANSWERS THAT

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.707
PARTICULAR. IF NOT I'M HAPPY

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:35.177

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.879
QUESTION ABOUT LITERACY. THIS

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:40.415
PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE DEVICES

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:41.683
TO ALL OF THE STUDENTS AND OUR

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.752

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:48.316
DEVICES WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:50.552
STUDENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS SO

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.420
THE WAY I THINK I KIND OF THINK

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.189
ABOUT THESE DEVICES WHEN IT

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:57.392
COMES TO CP IS. WILL USE.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.494

PROFESSIONAL TRAINING SO THAT

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:02.230
MAYBE A HAMMER IN SOME

WORKING ON AND IT IT REALLY

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:00.288
DEPENDS ON KIND OF HOW WE CAN

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:01.823
INCORPORATE THOSE SYSTEMS IT'S

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.258
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MAKE

YOU THANK YOU AFTER THE A

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:58.813
COUPLE OF COURSE TO ARM. THIS

01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.481
BEING INFORMATION THAT THE

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:01.916
SEVENTH- THIN CLIENT LAPTOPS

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:04.352
OUT OF CURIOSITY WHY THAT

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:06.288
NUMBER Y. THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND.

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:07.055
AND HOW YOU HOW DID YOU ARRIVE

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:10.625
AT THE- SURE ABSOLUTELY I CAN

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.294
ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.329
SO THE THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:15.397
ROUGHLY REPRESENTS THE NUMBER

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:16.798
OF STUDENTS THAT WE HAD IN OUR

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.933
PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW SO AS I

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:19.868
MENTIONED THAT'S ALL OF OUR

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:21.369
DEAR PIEPER GAMS ACADEMIC

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:23.038

AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:26.308
INTERVENTIONS. AND WE REDUCE

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:28.276
THE NUMBER SLIGHTLY FROM THE

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:30.011
OVERALL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:31.946
JUST TO REFLECT THAT YOU KNOW

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:34.482
FOLKS ARE IN TRANSIT OR MIGHT

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:35.884
BE OUT TO CORD OR A MEDICAL

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:36.951
APPOINTMENT OR THINGS LIKE

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:38.887
THAT. WE THINK THIS REPRESENTS

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:40.121
THE NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT WILL

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:41.923
NEED TO HAVE AVAILABLE I'M SURE

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.058
THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.959
THE ABILITY TO ACCESS ONE WHEN

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:46.661
THEY NEED IT. AND CAN YOU

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:47.729

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:51.599
PRIORITIZE AGAINST. DIFFERENT

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:52.901
KINDS OF EDUCATION SO MY

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:53.902
INSURANCE IS ABOUT TEN

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:55.737
THOUSAND. INMATES RIGHT NOW WHO

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.238
ENGAGE IN POST SECONDARY

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:58.239

PRIORITY OR OR IS THERE A

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:03.978
MATRIX FOR THAT SORT OF-

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:05.747
DETERMINATION. WE DO HAVE A-

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:06.781
FOR OUR ROLLING OUT THE

DEVICES- PRIMARILY THAT'S BASED

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:11.653
ON EACH. INDIVIDUAL LOCATION

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.788
EACH INSTITUTION RATHER THAN

SO THAT THAT. IN THE AGGREGATE

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.889
REPRESENTS A LOT OF MONEY- AND

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:01.823

IMPLEMENTED FOR SOME TIME AND

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:27.048

GETTING TOO MUCH INTO IT- IT

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:43.311
INVOLVES HAVING AN ENVIRONMENT

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.046
THAT CENTRAL SO WE CAN CONTROL

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:46.013
EVERYTHING THAT'S ON THE

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.749
ENVIRONMENT WE CAN CONTROL

THE STORES THAT THE IMAGE SHOPS

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:49.630

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:51.298

FROM THOSE CAMPAIGN. OVER THE

LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE CAMPAIGN

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:11.218
HAS REALLY INCREASED THE VOLUME

NOT ONLY OF SALES OF GOODS. AND

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.222
THAT IS MOSTLY DUE TO THE

INCREASE AND PRIVILEGE LEVELS

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.425

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.815
ALSO BROUGHT A LOT OF INMATES

01:38:41.882 --> 01:38:43.684

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:24.304
ANTICIPATE THAT THE SALARY

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:26.006
SAVINGS ARE TEMPORARY AND THEY

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:28.275
WON'T BE AVAILABLE ON GOING DCR

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:29.609
IS INCREASING THEIR HIRING

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:31.845
EFFORTS AND ALSO BE REDUCED-

01:47:31.912 --> 01:47:33.847
DUE TO THE TWO PERSON CLOSURES

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:35.482
THAT ARE THAT ARE FORTHCOMING.

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:37.184
AS THESE CHANGES TAKE PLACE IT

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:39.386
REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF THE

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:41.655
SALEABLE POSITION- I FEEL

01:47:41.721 --> 01:47:43.323
SALARY SAVINGS EXCUSE ME TO RE

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:47.894
DIRECT TOWARDS THE FOOD BUDGET-

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:49.529
SO AND PROPOSAL DESIGNATES.

01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:51.198
THAT SOME OF SAVINGS AS THE

01:47:51.264 --> 01:47:52.365
ALLEY ON MY WHICH IS WHY THE

01:47:52.432 --> 01:47:54.234
REQUEST IS ONLY THE DIFFERENCE

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:57.370
BETWEEN. THE FEEDING SPENDING

01:47:57.437 --> 01:47:59.039
PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:47:59.105 --> 01:48:00.407
THE HEALTHY MEN YOU KNOW-

01:48:00.473 --> 01:48:02.375
COMPARED TO THE NEW HEALTHY

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:08.381
MENU COSTS. I ALSO I THINK

01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:10.550
THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULTIES AB.

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:11.852
CURRENTLY JUST FILLING

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:13.320
POSITIONS DUE TO COVER IT SO

01:48:13.386 --> 01:48:14.888
AGAIN WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:16.323
SALARY SAVINGS WON'T BE

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:21.494
AVAILABLE ON GOING. OKAY OKAY

01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:23.496
THANK YOU I JUST HAVE A QUICK

01:48:23.563 --> 01:48:25.565
QUESTION ON THE A GOING BACK TO

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:28.802
THE CANTEEN RESOURCES ASKING

01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:34.374
FOR- SEVEN MORE POSITIONS OF

01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:36.476
HOW HOW WOULD YOU HOW DOES THAT

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:41.648
WORK. HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHERE

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:42.883
IN TERMS OF WORK WHICH

01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:45.185
INSTITUTIONS THOSE SEVEN

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:48.321
POSITIONS WILL WILL GO TO. HI

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:52.025
THIS IS ABCS- WE DIDN'T TAKE A

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:54.027
CLOSE LOOK AT THE OPERATIONS OF

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:55.929
OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WE HAVE

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:56.830
DETERMINED WHICH SEVEN THOSE

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:59.499
WILL BE- AND THE REASONS THEY

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:02.702
WERE CHOSEN WAS BECAUSE ONE OF

01:49:02.769 --> 01:49:04.671
THE BAG OUT FACILITY THERE'S

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:05.705
ONE THAT'S A COMPLETE BACKUP

01:49:05.772 --> 01:49:07.340
FACILITY AND THERE'S SEVERAL

01:49:07.407 --> 01:49:09.376
THAT HAVE BACKED OUT YARDS. AND

01:49:09.442 --> 01:49:11.378
WHEN YOU DO BAG OUT THERE'S A

01:49:11.444 --> 01:49:12.846
LOT OF WORK THAT GOES ALONG

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:14.014
WITH THAT YOU HAVE TO SEND OUT

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.415
SHOPPING LIST OF THE HOUSING

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:17.918
UNITS GIVEN BACK BAG UP THE

01:49:17.984 --> 01:49:20.420
ITEMS AND THEN DISTRIBUTE THEM

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:22.222
AND THAT REQUIRES LOADING

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:23.990
TRUCKS MOVING THEM TO SALLY

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:25.425
PORTS AND THEN DISTRIBUTING

01:49:25.492 --> 01:49:26.927
THOSE ORDERS. BUT I HOPE

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:29.362
PROCESS TAKES A LONG TIME SO

01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:29.963
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:31.464
WE CONSIDERED THE OTHER THING

01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:33.633
WE CONSIDERED WISE WHAT KIND OF

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:34.968
PROGRAMMING IS GOING ON IN

01:49:35.035 --> 01:49:35.869
THOSE INSTITUTIONS OR

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:38.371
VOCATIONAL TRAINING WHICH TAKE

01:49:38.438 --> 01:49:40.073
THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE OUT

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:41.942
INTO PROGRAMMING A MAJORITY OF

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:44.210
THE TIME AND SO WE WANT TO WE

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.779
HAVE TO KEEP THE CANTONS OPEN

01:49:45.845 --> 01:49:47.881
LONGER AT THOSE FACILITIES. THE

01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:50.116
ONE THAT CASE WE ALSO NEED MORE

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:52.419
STAFF TO RUN THE CANTEENS

01:49:52.485 --> 01:49:54.854
LONGER FOR THOSE WERE A COUPLE

01:49:54.921 --> 01:49:57.090
OF THE OTHER AND CONSIDERATION

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.358
WAS THE TYPE OF INMATE

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:00.794
POPULATION AT THE INSTITUTIONS

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:02.729

WERE HAPPENING AND WHAT OUR

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:23.837
SALES ARE- AND ALSO TRYING TO

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:25.071

SO I GOT A DEGREE WORK FOR ME

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.335
BUT I DO I DO I THINK. IT WOULD

01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:56.936
BE HELPFUL TO SEE HOW THOSE

01:52:57.003 --> 01:52:59.305
PRICES TO COMPARE SO THEY WILL

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:01.107

SAY AT THIS POINT- AND

01:53:18.224 --> 01:53:20.560
CERTAINLY THERE'S TIME FOR

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:22.428
FURTHER STUDY- I DON'T. REALLY

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:24.664
UNDERSTAND THE FULL EQUATION

01:53:24.731 --> 01:53:28.835

DECLINING OVERALL DECLINING.

01:53:34.707 --> 01:53:39.078
CENSUS OF POPULATION- IN

01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:40.880
INCREASING DEMAND BY THE

01:53:40.947 --> 01:53:44.450

MILLION DOLLARS- ANY IT ANY

01:53:57.697 --> 01:54:01.134
FURTHER. SORT OF BREAKDOWN OF

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:02.635
THAT MATH WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

01:54:02.702 --> 01:54:04.204
ME JUST UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT THE

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:06.206
