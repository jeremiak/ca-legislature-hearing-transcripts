OUR SHARED AMERICAN HISTORY IS

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:16.860 region:rollup2
RIDDLED WITH INJUSTICE AND

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:18.395 region:rollup2
EVENTS THAT LOOKING BACK.

CAN ONLY THINK.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:24.668 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE THE THINKING

HOW COULD THEY DO THIS?

01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:28.571 region:rollup2
THE RHETORIC OF THEN. IT'S NO

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:31.107 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN THE RHETORIC OF

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:32.542 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:35.045 region:rollup2
MUCH OF WHAT WE HEAR AGAINST

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:37.213 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS.

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:49.893 region:rollup2
BUT IN WHAT IS TODAY'S RHETORIC

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:51.227 region:rollup2
WE MUST LEARN FROM THE PAST.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:52.595 region:rollup2
WE MUST BE ON GUARD WHEN OUR

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:54.497 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT SEEKS IT TAKE AWAY

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:55.765 region:rollup2
THE FREEDOM OF ANY PERSON.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:58.001 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE A CITIZEN OF THE

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:59.836 region:rollup2
