DISPENSE THAT PRESCRIPTION FOR

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.443
OXYCONTIN. I HAVE TO LOOK AT A

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.312

PRESCRIPTION BACK AND SAY I'M

SORRY I'M NOT GOING TO FEEL

THAT PRESCRIPTION BY LAW. IF I

00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:11.096
FEEL THAT PRESCRIPTION. I COULD

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:11.697
HAVE A STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:14.399
INSPECTOR IN MY PHARMACY.

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:20.105

AN ACCUSATION MIGHT BE AGAINST

ME AND MY PHARMACY. AND THE

00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:26.278
POWER OF THE STATE BOARD OF

00:22:26.344 --> 00:22:26.912
PHARMACY IS IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:29.281
THE RULES. THEY COULD BE THE

REVOKE YOUR LICENSE. SO

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.989
QUESTION THAT ALL OF US HAVE.

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:40.225
IS WHY ARE WE EMPOWERING THE

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:40.826
MEDICAL BOARD TO POLICE THEIR

OWN. TO ME THIS OF ADMISSION.

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:48.500
BUT THE MEDICAL BOARD DOESN'T

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:49.935
EITHER WANT TO ENFORCE THESE

00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:53.305
PROVISIONS. OR THEY ARE

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:54.973
INCAPABLE OF ENFORCING THESE

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.544
PROVISIONS. BY NOW GIVING THE

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:01.713
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. THE

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.884
RESPONSIBILITY. OF REVIEWING

00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:07.119
WHAT THE MEDICAL BOARD COULD BE

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:08.487
REVIEWING IS BASICALLY TELLING

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:12.224
THOSE. THE ARE STRONGLY

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.792
CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.261
THEIR CHILDREN'S WELFARE IF

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:17.863
THEY HAVE TWO CHILDREN THAT

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:20.565
HAVE HAD ADVERSE REACTIONS TO.

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:21.500
IMMUNIZATIONS AND I'M NOT

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:22.968
TALKING ABOUT A RASH OF TALKING

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:25.370
ABOUT ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK. IF I

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:28.974
WERE A PARENT I WOULD SEEK. AN

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.509
EXEMPTION SO WHAT ARE THE

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:32.043
PARENTS GONNA DO NOW WHEN THE

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.213
ANSWER IS NO. THEY'RE GONNA

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.349
HAVE TO APPEAL TO A LARGE

00:23:37.415 --> 00:23:38.817
BUREAUCRACY AND HAVE TO DEAL

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:41.086
WITH A- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:43.088
OF VEHICLES PROCEDURE TO

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:45.090
SAFEGUARD THEIR CHILD. IF

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:45.724
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THEIR KIDS

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:50.095
IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL. AGAIN

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:52.931
FOLKS. I REALLY I BELIEVE IN

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:54.299
IMMUNIZATIONS I BELIEVE THEY

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:57.169
SAVE LIVES BUT THERE ARE RARE

00:23:57.235 --> 00:24:03.175
INSTANCES WHERE. A EXCLUSION IS

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:06.945
MANDATED NECESSARY. IF WE HAVE

00:24:07.012 --> 00:24:08.413
PHYSICIANS THAT ARE ABUSING

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.848
THEIR AUTHORITY IN WRITING

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:11.683
THESE EXEMPTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:16.388
WITH GOOD MEDICAL PRACTICE THE

00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:19.758
NOT MEDICAL BOARD TO STEP IN.

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:20.292
SUSPEND OR RE REVOKE THEIR

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:24.062
LICENSES. AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:26.198
THAT WILL CURE THE PROBLEM IF

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:27.732
YOU WILL OF INAPPROPRIATE

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:30.368
EXEMPTIONS BEING GIVEN. BUT

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:32.571
EVERY PATIENT THE GOES TO A

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:34.940
DOCTOR IS UNIQUE THE PRESENTS

00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:37.542
WITH VERY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:39.311
WE CAN'T DOCUMENT EVERY SINGLE

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:39.911
SIDE EFFECT THAT HAPPENS WITH

00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:42.347
EVERY DRUG. BUT WE HAVE AN

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:44.015
ANSWER TO BE READ THE ANSWER TO

00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:44.983

IT'LL SCARE YOU AS A CLAIMS

00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:49.788
OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE'S

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:50.355
LIVES. IN THE UNITED STATES

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:52.824
EVERY SINGLE YEAR. BUT IF YOU

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:53.425
TAKE A NUMBER OF THEM CONSIDER

00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:56.394
GIVEN. IN THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA. AND YOU ADVERTISE

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.799
THAT TO SEE WHAT THE OVERALL

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:03.835
HERD IMMUNITY. WOULD BE AS A

00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:06.705
RESULT. YOU STILL WOULD HAVE

00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:08.273
EFFECTIVE IMMUNITY. ARE

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.508
PROTECTING. OUR CHILDREN IN THE

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:14.613
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO. WHILE

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:15.714
I SUPPORT THAT WE GIVE

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.182
IMMUNIZATIONS TWO PEOPLE THAT

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:21.586
CAN. SAFELY RECEIVE THEM. MAYBE

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:25.724
SCATTERING. THE SCHEDULE

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.992
BECAUSE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE

00:25:27.058 --> 00:25:28.693
THAT GETTING TOO MANY

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.895
IMMUNIZATIONS AT ONE TIME CAN

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:31.863
OVERWHELM THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.732
THAT MAY BE THE CAUSE OF SOME

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:36.234
OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS BUT

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:36.801
MY FRIENDS WE SHOULD LET THE

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:39.704
MEDICAL BOARD. DO WHAT THEY

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:44.042
WERE APPOINTED TO DO. AND THAT

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:45.644
IS TO OVERSEE THE PRACTICE OF

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.545
MEDICINE TO ENSURE THAT QUALITY

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:49.381
HEALTHCARE IS BEING DELIVERED

00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:50.649
TO EACH AND EVERY PATIENT

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:52.250
WHETHER IT'S A CHILD OR AN

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:53.618
ADULT IN THE STATE OF

00:25:53.685 --> 00:25:55.820
CALIFORNIA AND THOSE PHYSICIANS

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:56.588
THE ABROGATE THOSE

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:59.257
RESPONSIBILITIES. AND CHARGE A

00:25:59.324 --> 00:25:59.991
FEE TO WRITE AN EXEMPTION

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:02.160
BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT THE

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:02.861
MONEY INSTEAD OF LOOKING OUT

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:03.495
FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:05.497
CHILD. THEN THEY SHOULD BE

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:07.065
DISCIPLINED BY THE MEDICAL

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:09.401
BOARD WE SHOULD BE HAVING THAT

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:10.869
RESPONSIBILITY OFF TO A THIRD

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:12.137
PARTY IN THE STATE OF

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:13.571
CALIFORNIA NAMELY THE

00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:15.407
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THAT'S AN

00:26:15.473 --> 00:26:17.175
ABROGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY BY

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:17.809
THE MEDICAL BOARD AND FOR THOSE

00:26:17.876 --> 00:26:20.645
REASONS. I THINK COULD VOTE

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:22.914

OF MY BREAKFAST ON THE WAY UP.

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:17.769
AND SO IT WAS A LITTLE

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:18.837
FRUSTRATING WHEN THEY WOULD

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:19.971
SAVE SORRY WE'RE NOT HANDING

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:22.073

OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING HAS BECAUSE

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES TO DO THAT

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:52.170

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:07.252

IN WASHINGTON. WE'VE SEEN IT IN

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:06.838
CALIFORNIA. BUT I TELL YOU THE

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:11.142
VIDEO IN COVERAGE THAT I SAW OF

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:14.111
HOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:16.714
SACRAMENTO WAS TREATED. HE'S

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:20.318
ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. IN

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:24.322
THIS THIS BODY CONVENES PRIOR

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:27.024

EVEN THOUGH MANY OF S DISAGREE

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:33.064
WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.266
THIS IS NOT HOW WE DO THE

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:38.269
PEOPLE'S BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:40.004
IF WE DISAGREED WITH A PIECE OF

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:42.740
LEGISLATION WE CAN PASSIONATELY

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:45.276
FINE VENUES TO EXPRESS THAT.

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:47.144
BECOMING PHYSICAL IN TRYING TO

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:49.580
INTIMIDATE OR LEGISLATORS IS

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:51.115
WHAT HAPPENS IN BANANA

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:53.818
REPUBLICS NOT IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:56.354
CERTAINLY NOT THE UNITED STATES.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.023
SO HAVING SAID THAT. I STILL

CONCERNS THAT I EXPRESS PRIOR.

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:14.872
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:17.008

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:23.381
REVIEWS TO A BUREAUCRATIC BODY.

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:25.383
WHEN THE MEDICAL BOARD IS THE

00:36:25.449 --> 00:36:27.351
BODY THAT HAS THE APPROPRIATE

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:30.454

WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN SCIENCE

POLITICS OF TODAY WE SEE THAT

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:49.393
AROUND CLIMATE WE SEE IT HERE

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.496
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TO SPEW

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:55.633
BASIC SCIENTIFIC FACTS AND WE

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.002
HAVE SEEN IT ON THE DEBATES

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:01.072

VACCINES WORKS AS A BULLY IN

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:10.448
MISINFORMATION IS CIRCULATED

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.516
ABOUT VACCINES AND WHAT THAT

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:16.253
DOES IS DESIGNED TO CAUSE FEAR

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.556
AND IT LEADS TO THE ATMOSPHERE

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:20.624
THAT WE HAVE SEEN AROUND THIS

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:22.860
BILL AND IT IS ON ACCEPTABLE WE

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:25.362
CAN PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:26.564

ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN STOCKS

00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:30.501
AND IT DIANNE IS CLEAR THAT

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.970
VACCINES WORK THAT MAKE OUR

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:35.005
COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE. THEY

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:38.342
SAVE ON ACCOUNTABLE LIVES HERE

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.411
AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT OUR

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:42.179
CHILDREN NEED TO BE BACK HERE

00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:47.885
AGAIN. SEIZE POTENTIALLY DEADLY

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:54.191
DISEASES. AS A THIS IS JUST A

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:55.459
BASIC MATTER OF SCIENTIFIC FACT

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:56.727
AN OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:57.528
COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE SEEN.

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.063
DIED AFTER SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN

00:39:59.130 --> 00:39:59.697
WAS PASSED THAT WHEN ALL THESE

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:01.699
BOGUS FRAUDULENT MEDICAL

00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:03.234
EXEMPTIONS WERE GRANTED WE

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.170
STARTED TO SEE MORE CASES OF

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:08.506
THE MEASLES. A DISEASE THAT WE

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:11.208
HAD EFFECTIVELY A RADIC HEATED

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:14.111
KEEPS MAKING A COMEBACK BECAUSE

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.714
OF THE MISINFORMATION AROUND

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:19.917
VACCINES. I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:21.252
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS

00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:24.321
BILL. BUT THIS BILL ONLY KICKS

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:25.623
IN WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SOME

00:40:25.689 --> 00:40:28.359
SORT OF INDICATION OF A PROBLEM

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:30.027
WHEN YOU HAVE A PHYSICIAN THAT

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.263
IS WRITING A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:38.769
THESE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. IF

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:39.937
THERE IS A HIGH VACCINATION

00:40:40.004 --> 00:40:40.704
RATE IN THE SCHOOL OR IF YOU

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.006
HAVE A PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:43.841
WRITING A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:45.576
EXEMPTIONS THIS BILL DOESN'T

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:49.046
EVEN KICK IN THIS IS ABOUT THE

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.882
BAD ACTOR PHYSICIANS. AND IT'S

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.083
ABOUT SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.953
SAFE. FOR THE CHILDREN WHO

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.789
ACTUALLY CAN'T BE VACCINATED

00:40:58.856 --> 00:40:59.757
AND THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICALLY

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.459
IMPORTANT POINT. FOR THE VERY

00:41:02.526 --> 00:41:05.396
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:09.567
ACTUALLY REQUIRE A MEDICAL

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.836
EXEMPTION INCLUDING BABIES.

00:41:11.902 --> 00:41:15.339
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GET. THE

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:16.807
MEASLES VACCINE WHEN YOU'RE A

00:41:16.874 --> 00:41:18.309
NEW BORN YOU HAVE TO WAIT. AND

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.577
SO THESE INDIVIDUALS WHETHER

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:21.111
SOMEONE WITH A MEDICAL

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:22.746
CONDITION YOU CAN GET BACK

00:41:22.813 --> 00:41:25.216
SENATE OR YOU HAVE A BABY.

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:28.018
VISIT PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED AND

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.954
WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.956
CHOOSING NOT TO GET VACCINES

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:33.858
AND DOCTORS WHO ARE WRITING

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:35.693
FRAUDULENT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS.

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.928
YOU ARE DIRECTLY PUTTING IN

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.597
DANGER THE PEOPLE AND THE

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:42.800
BABIES WHO CANNOT BE VACCINATED

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.268
THIS BILL DOES NOT GET RID OF

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.403
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IT SIMPLY

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.172
PUTS SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE SO

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.975
THAT PHYSICIANS CANNOT COMMIT

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:53.577
FRAUD. AND SO THAT WE DO NOT

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:57.514
SEE A RESURGENCE OF THESE

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:58.115
DEADLY DISEASES I ASKED FOR AN

00:41:58.182 --> 00:42:05.689
IPO. THANK YOU SENATOR MORROW.

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:08.125
THANK YOU HI COLLEAGUES THE OB

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:12.429
MAKE MY COMMENTS BRIEF BECAUSE

00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:13.163
I JUST WANNA PICKING OUT OF

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.598
BACK ON WHAT A- FEW OF MY

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.367
COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:20.237
BUT THE THING THAT I WANT TO

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:23.607
JUST MY MAIN POINT IS THIS SO

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:25.809
MANY THINGS THAT THIS BODY DOES

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:26.310
YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT THE

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:27.878
CONSTITUTION SPOTS BEING

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:28.846
LIMITED BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:29.446
BODY INSERTS ITSELF IN ALMOST

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:30.814
EVERY PART OF THE LIVES OF

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:35.552
AMERICANS TODAY. AND WE

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:40.457
OVERSTEP OUR BOUNDARY I THINK.

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:42.259
TOO OFTEN ESPECIALLY I IT IT

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:44.094
DOES WORRY ME THAT THIS BODY

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:45.729
BELIEVES WRAPS THEY KNOW MORE

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:47.731
THAN PERRANCE IN A DOCTOR. AND

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:50.367
SO WE NEED TO GET BACK LADIES

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:52.002
AND GENTLEMAN TO THE TO THE

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.903
PARENTS MAKING THOSE DECISIONS

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.204
AND CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:55.839
DOCTOR NOT A BODY OF

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:56.674
POLITICIANS THAT HAVE COME FROM

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.810
EVERY WALK OF LIFE. IN FEW OF

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:00.911
THEM THAT ARE IN THE MEDICAL

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:03.981
FIELD SO I RESERVE MY COMMENTS

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:05.749
SIR IT TOOK TO JUST THAT AND I

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:09.053
WILL BE A STRONG. IN OPPOSITION

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:11.889
TO THIS BILL THANKS FOR YOUR

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:12.523
TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:18.662
DALLY. THANK YOU MISTER

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.230
PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS AYE.

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:21.098
HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:22.499
SPEAK ON THIS BILL I WAS IN THE

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:24.735
ASSEMBLY WHAT WAS HER HERE AND

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.570
THEN I CAME TO THE SENATE. IS

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:28.572
MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY I WANT TO.

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:32.443
SHARE WITH THE BODY THAT. I'M

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:34.111
NOT SOMEBODY WHO IS A ANTI

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:35.379
BOXER I MY CHILDREN WERE

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:39.216
VACCINATED. BUT WE DID CONSULT

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:42.519
WITH A DOCTOR AND WE. WE

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:44.221
EXTENDED THE TIMES OUT WE

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:46.690
DIDN'T DO THE SECOND MMR UNDER

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:50.561
HIS GUIDANCE. AND BUT I THINK

00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:51.028
IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:54.999
VACCINATIONS. IT'S ABOUT. THE

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:57.001
FREEDOMS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THIS

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:59.770
STATE TO BE A PARENT AND HAVE A

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:02.072
CHOICE WHETHER THEY CHOOSE HOW

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.141
TO RAISE OUR CHILD AND WHETHER

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.743
THEY CAN GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.177
NOW YOU MAY SAY YES THEY CAN GO

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:09.079
TO THIS BOARD AND THEY CAN JUMP

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.080
THROUGH THE HOOPS TO GET WHERE

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.749
THEY WANT TO GO BUT IT'S A

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.717
REALLY DETERRING FACTOR FOR A

00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:16.687
LOT OF THE CONSTITUENTS I

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.689
REPRESENT WHO I SAW OVER THE

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.090
WEEKEND YOU RE CONTEMPLATING

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:22.226
LEAVING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE-

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:22.826
THEY DON'T LIKE THIS PIECE OF

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:26.997
LEGISLATION. SO IT'S THEIR

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:27.731
FAULT NAVIN YOU TO SOMEHOW GET

00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:28.332
THERE AND WE'RE ALWAYS AFTER

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:28.966
THE BAD ACTOR BUT IN THE TIMES

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:30.934
THAT WE GO AFTER THOSE BAD

00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:33.771
ACTORS OUT THERE. OR PEOPLE WHO

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:36.907
ARE ABUSING THE RIGHT. WE

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.742
CAPTURE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE.

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:42.446
THAT ARE TRYING TO BE.

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:43.480
RESPONSIBLE PARENTS AND

00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:46.150
SAFEGUARD THEIR CHILDREN IN

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.485
THROUGH THEIR CHOICES. TO ME

00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:50.521
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT WE DID

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:52.456
WE HAD SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.725
WHICH- WAS NARROWLY CRAFTED IN

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:59.063
AND GAVE A EASIER OPPORTUNITY

00:44:59.129 --> 00:44:59.696
FOR PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:01.932
THAT EXEMPTION. YOU KNOW IT'S A

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:03.133
CHOICE OF WHETHER YOU'RE GOING

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:03.867
TO GO TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL OR

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:04.802
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA HOME WHAT

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:06.036
WERE YOU GONNA DO WITH YOUR

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:06.970
CHILD AND THEY WANT TO GET

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.572
EDUCATION THEY PAY TAXES LIKE

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.040
EVERYBODY ELSE I WANT TO ACCESS

00:45:10.107 --> 00:45:11.408
TO SYSTEMS. FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:14.878
BUT THIS IS ABOUT PERSONAL.

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:18.182
ADAMS AND THE RIGHT OF A PARENT

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.349
THE BILL TO MAKE WHAT THEY

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:20.384
THINK IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR

00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:21.618
THEIR CHILDREN SO I THINK THIS

00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:23.854
BILL GOES TOO FAR I KNOW THERE

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.622
ARE EXEMPTIONS BUT THOSE

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:26.290
EXEMPTIONS ARE TOUGH TO GET

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:29.193
THROUGH. AND SOMETIMES I THINK

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:29.927
THAT THAT'S THE GOAL IS THAT

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:32.463
YOU MAKE IT SO HARD THAT IT'S

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.231
VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE LAY

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:35.132
PERSON TO GET THROUGH THE

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:37.534
PROCESS SO YOU END UP GETTING

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:38.302
THE GOAL WHERE YOU'RE

00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:39.837
BASICALLY. COMING TO SOCIAL

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:42.506
THREE TELLING EVERYBODY HOW TO

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:43.107
LIVE THEIR LIVES. AND I THINK

00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:47.077
THAT'S WRONG. WE WERE HERE THAT

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:48.545
WE'RE HERE TO. MAKE JUST LAWS

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:49.279
WE'RE ALSO HERE TO KEEP

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:52.683
PEOPLE'S PERSONAL FREEDOMS. AND

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:54.551
SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:57.855
IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

00:45:57.921 --> 00:46:02.359
THANK YOU CENTER CENTER WROTE.

FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED BY

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:11.068
MY COLLEAGUES AND IT'S AN HONOR

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:11.935
TO BE THE REPUBLICAN LEADER

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.437
WHEN THEY A SAND SO STRONG

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:15.272
AGAINST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:16.206
ARE BEING SPOKEN ON THIS FLOOR

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.341
TODAY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:20.177
BILL I DO HAVE A QUESTION THE

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:21.778
AUTHOR IF YOU WOULD SO KILEY

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:22.846
TAKE A QUESTION. WHEN WE TO

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:25.115
QUESTION FORCE I KNOW THAT

00:46:25.182 --> 00:46:26.917
OFTENTIMES AS WITH LEGISLATORS

00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:29.153
RIGHT LEGISLATION THERE IS AN

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:32.189
INTENT BEHIND THAT AND I WOULD

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:34.391
HOPE THAT YOUR INTENT IS NOT TO

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:35.225
STOP COMPLETE MEDICAL

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:37.828
EXEMPTIONS FOR FAMILIES THAT

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:40.097
NEED OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:42.299
MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN SO

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:44.101
IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESSES ARE

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:47.971
YOUR INTENT. WHAT WOULD IT BE A

00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:54.912
MEDICAL EXEMPTION. YOU MAY

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:56.647
RESPOND. SO I IF THANK YOU SO

MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION FIRST OF

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:59.316
ALL I'D SAY THE INTENT OF THE

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:01.952
BILL IS TO KEEP CHILDREN SAFE.

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:02.553
AND PARTICULARLY CHILDREN WHO

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:03.187
ACTUALLY NEED MEDICAL

00:47:03.253 --> 00:47:04.655
EXEMPTIONS. BECAUSE IF THEY

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:06.056
RECEIVE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:07.057
MEANS THEY'RE NOT FULLY

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:08.325
VACCINATED. AS OUT FULLY

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.494
VACCINATED THEY ARE VULNERABLE.

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:13.030
TO THOSE DISEASES SO WE DON'T

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:13.597
HAVE A HIGH IN A VACCINATION

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.832
RATE IN THE SCHOOL. FOUND THEM

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.167
THEY ARE AT RISK OF ACTUALLY

00:47:17.234 --> 00:47:17.734
GETTING EXPOSED AND CATCHING

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:20.938
THE DISEASE. NOW WHAT THE BILL

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:22.706
DOES AND I'M GONNA DRESS ALSO

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.141
THE AMENDMENTS IS THAT WE

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:26.443
ACTUALLY SAY THAT THE VALUATION

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.946
OF A MEDICAL EXEMPTION REQUEST

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:32.349
IS BASED ON GUIDELINES

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.218
INCLUDING THE STANDARD OF CARE

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:35.752
CENTERS CARES WHAT ANY

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.921
REASONABLE PHYSICIAN. WOULD

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:40.557
FIND THAT'S REASONABLE TO GRANT

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:41.658
A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IN FACT I

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.527
WOULDPOINT OUT THAT BEGAN MY

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:46.430
PRESENTATION OF THE AMENDMENTS

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:48.765
THAT WHEN THIS BILL LEFT THIS.

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:51.168
FLOOR WE TOOK A MENACE THAT

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:53.103
FIRST OF ALL SAID THAT NOT ONLY

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:54.471
DOES GET REVIEWED BY OUR PUBLIC

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:55.038
HEALTH WHICH WAS IN THE BILL

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:56.240
WHEN WE DEBATED HERE WE

00:47:56.306 --> 00:48:01.311
ACTUALLY CREATED A APPEALS.

00:48:01.378 --> 00:48:01.812
PANEL COMPOSED OF THREE

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:06.650
PRACTICING PHYSICIANS. BUT

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:07.251
THEY'RE NOT PLEASE OF THE PART

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:10.287
OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THREE

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:11.888
PRACTICING PHYSICIANS WHO

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:13.523
BASICALLY WILL APPLY STANDARD

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.725
OF CARE WHICH MEANS IF A

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:15.959
REASONABLE POSITION WOULD GRANT

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:16.693
A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IN THAT

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.761
CIRCUMSTANCE THEN THEY WILL

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:20.631
PROVE THAT EXEMPTION. AND I

00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:21.698
THINK THAT THAT'S A YEAH WE

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:24.201
TALK ABOUT DOCTORS AND THIS IS

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:25.168
A GROUP OF DOCTORS THAT

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:26.770
BASICALLY ARE GOING TO SAY YOU

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:27.638
KNOW WHAT THAT SOMETHING

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:28.872
REASONABLE POSITION WOULD DO

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:31.508
THEN THE EXEMPTION WILL STAND.

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:32.576
AND SO THAT IS THE STANDARD IN

00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:35.779
WHICHWE HAVE PLACED AND IN

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:39.883
THIS BILL. AND SO I WOULD JUST.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.685
NOTE THAT AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:42.552
THE BILL IS TO KEEP. PEOPLE

00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:45.289
SAFE. FOR KIDS SAFE IN SCHOOL

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:46.490
AND WE ARE GOING TO APPLY. A

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:48.325
STANDARD OF CARE WHICH IS AGAIN

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:49.826
WHAT A REASONABLE POSITION

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:51.828
WOULD DO. AND I THINK THAT IF

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.397
AN IF WE START TALKING ABOUT

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:54.197
UNREASONABLE ACTS AND THERE I

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:55.299
THINK ONE HAS TO ARGUE. THAT

00:48:55.365 --> 00:48:56.633
MAYBE WE DO NEED TO STEP IN

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.701
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE

00:48:57.768 --> 00:49:00.337
RIGHT YOU DON'T THE PRIVILEGE.

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:00.871
OF INJURING SOMEONE ELSE'S

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:05.375
CHILD. LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:06.009
WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:08.145
INJURE SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD.

00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:08.712
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:11.715
ABOUT. THANK YOU. SO I

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:13.550

BASICALLY. MY COLLEAGUES AND A

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:16.653
LOT OF THE PARENTS THAT THAT

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.823
OPPOSE THIS BILL I THINK THAT

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:20.457
THERE IS NO MANNER OR MECHANISM

00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:23.627
IN TWO. AT MEDICAL EXEMPTION

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:24.728

SAID WELL IN ADVANCE OF A VERY

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:31.688
RARE. CONDITION AND I WOULD SAY

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:34.057
IS THAT IF IT'S WITHIN REASON.

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:36.059

DISEASE YOU DON'T IF THERE'S

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:46.536
EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAD THE

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:49.105
DISEASE AND NOW YOU. THEN YOU

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.774
DON'T NEED TO GET THE MUSICIAN

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:51.475
FACT I MYSELF OF WRITTEN

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:52.409
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR THAT

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.478
VERY REASON. AND I'M CERTAINLY

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.346
NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BEING

00:51:56.413 --> 00:51:57.581
UNDER SCRUTINY BY THE

00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:58.915
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:00.484
I WOULD POINT OUT. THIS REALLY

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.651
IS A PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:02.385
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING TO

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.054
REVIEW DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.589
PUBLIC HEALTH THE ACTUAL REVIEW

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:07.791
OF. VACCINATIONS AND THE NEED

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:09.626
TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IS THE

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:11.294
VENUE IS THE CHARGE OF THE

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:12.929
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HOUSE. AND SO

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:14.097
AGAIN THOSE ARE JUST SOME

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.999
EXAMPLES TO ENSURE WE CAN COME

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.300
WITH MANY OTHER EXAMPLES AS

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:19.636
WELL. OF REASONS WHY SOMEONE

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:22.005
WOULD I GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:23.573
AGAIN THAT'S WE HAVE A THAT'S

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.941
WHY WE CREE HAVE THE FARM

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:27.043
PUBLIC HEALTH. WHO DOES CONTAIN

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.044
YOU KNOW DO HAVE EXPERTS THEIR

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:30.881
PHYSICIANS AND NURSES. WHO ARE

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.749
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT PUBLIC

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:34.484
HEALTH INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:44.027
FACT WE TRUST THEM. TO FOLLOW

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:51.334
PEOPLE WITH HIV WITH STDS.

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:51.835
OTHER KINDS OF CONTENT

00:52:51.902 --> 00:52:53.069
INFECTIOUS DISEASES THEY ARE

00:52:53.136 --> 00:52:54.170
THE ONES WHO ARE CALLED OUT TO

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:55.772
HELP OUT. IN OUTBREAKS WHETHER

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.541
IT'S HEPATITIS C. MEASLES. AND

00:52:57.607 --> 00:52:58.441
TYPHOID ANYTHING ELSE THEY ARE

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:00.076
VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THAT

00:53:00.143 --> 00:53:01.578
AND IF WE DON'T LIKE THEIR

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:02.279
DECISION TO GO SO BOARD OF

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:03.480
PRACTICING PHYSICIANS. WHO SAY

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:04.848
IS THIS A REASONABLE THING TO

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.082
DO. AND IF IT IS THEN THE

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:07.851
EXEMPTION WILL BE APPROVED AND

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:08.818
SO I THINK THAT. WE ACTUALLY

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:09.719
CREATE A FAIRLY BROAD

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:11.254
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:11.955
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IF DANGER

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.023
YOU I ONLY NEED ONE. I WOULD

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:13.723
POINT OUT THAT I ACTUALLY

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.225
BELIEVE THAT THE BOARD WILL.

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:16.426
ESSENTIALLY SAY THAT IF THERE'S

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:17.694
ANY QUESTION. THERE'S ANY

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:18.762
QUESTION SOMEONE NEEDS A

00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:20.297
MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND THAT THE

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:22.499
THERE'S A NICHE. THAT BASICALLY

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:24.167
A RULE IN FAVOR OF THE FAMILY.

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:26.069
RIGHT SB IF THAT IS SO YEAH

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:27.604
LET'S BE BLUNT. IF SOMEONE SAYS

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:28.505
WELL I WANT AMERICANS ACTION

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:29.706
BECAUSE MY CHILD HAS AUTISM.

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:30.373
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:36.546
BECAUSE WE HAVE. CONSIDERABLE

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:37.147
RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT THERE'S

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:41.418
NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE TWO.

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:42.018
HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE ANY IF

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:43.753
THERE'S EVEN A QUESTION THAT

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.655
THERE MIGHT BE AN ASSOCIATION

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:47.624
BETWEEN TWO. I THINK SIR THE

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.259
AYE. I THINK THE INCLINATION

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:50.093
WOULD BE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.662
THAT'S WHAT WE WILL WE WANT TO

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:53.263
OPERATE IN THE BENEFIT OF THE

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.765
PARENT AND THE CHILD. THANK YOU

00:53:55.832 --> 00:53:57.434
I JUST. WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.568
THE WHOLE FAMILY HISTORY OR IF

00:53:58.635 --> 00:53:59.569
YOU HAVE HIS STORY YOU'RE- A

00:53:59.636 --> 00:54:00.804
SPECIAL DISEASE CDC

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:01.705
CONTRADICTION IS NOT ALLOWED

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:02.272
UNDER STANDARD OF CARE FOR

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:03.340
MEDICAL HISTORY. SO I THINK

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:04.708
EVEN USING MEDICAL HISTORY. AND

00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:05.375
IF THAT'S NOT TRUE I'D LOVE FOR

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:06.610
YOU TO TELL ME WHAT IS TRUE

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:07.577
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:08.912
THE- I ASKED THE CDC AND HE

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:10.180
SAID. THAT IS NOT COVERED THAT

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:10.947
MEDICALLY STREETS NOT COVERED

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:12.115
AS THE CDC CONTRADICTION. WHICH

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:13.049
MAKES A LOT OF THE FAMILIES

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.784
VERY VERY NERVOUS. THAT ARE IN

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:15.986
THE BACK IN THE GALLERY AND

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:18.355
WATCHING ONLINE BECAUSE- IF

00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:20.423
THEY HAVE A CHILD THAT HAD AN

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.391
ADVERSE REACTION TO IT IS. TO A

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:24.561
VACCINE ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO.

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:25.729
THAT WE INJECT OUR CHILDREN

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:27.631
WITH THEM. SO WHEN WE HAVE

00:54:27.697 --> 00:54:29.766
THOSE VACCINES INJECTED AND YOU

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.101
HAVE A CHILD THAT HAS A MEDICAL

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:32.302
HISTORY. AND IS MEDICALLY

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:34.170

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:08.958

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:09.492
SURE WILL BE REVIEWED BY A

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.326
PHYSICIAN AND THEN AT THAT

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.029
POINT IN TIME IF THE PART OF

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:13.930
PUBLIC HEALTH SAYS THAT. THE

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:16.165

THE WAY I SHOULD ALSO MENTION

THAT WHILE IT'S GOING THROUGH

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:22.605
THIS PROCESS YOUR CHILD HAS

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:23.973

IT AND BY THE FALL YOU GET THE

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.714
MEDICAL SECTION. THEN WHAT

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.316
HAPPENS IS THAT IT IS REJECTED.

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:39.021
THEN YOU'LL BE NOTIFIED. AND

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:39.622

ADDITIONAL FAT INFORMATION TO

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:54.837
THE PANEL. AND THEN THEY WERE

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:58.207
REVIEW. AND IF THEY REVIEW THEY

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.041
SAY THAT SOMETHING VISIBLE

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.376
PHYSICIAN WOULD DO THEN THEY

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:01.344
WILL APPROVE IT. AND YOU'RE

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.046
SET. IF THEY ALSO DECLINE THEN

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.214

COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE AGREED ON

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:45.087
THE IMPORTANCE OF HOW WE ENGAGE

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.123
IN CIVIL DISCOURSE HOW WE

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.792

THEY FEEL TO BE BEST FOR THEIR

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:08.411

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:10.479
BUT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:11.047
AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE ON THE

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:14.617
FLOOR TODAY. BECAUSE THEY DO

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:19.121
NOT PREVENT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:21.490
THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US TODAY

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:23.626
DO NOT PRE VENT A MEDICAL

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:26.762
EXEMPTION. AND I DO WANT TO

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:29.232

INTERFERING WITH PERSONAL

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:35.371
FREEDOM. PERSONAL FREEDOM IS

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.807

YOU CAN'T EXCEED THE SPEED

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.318
LIMIT BECAUSE IT ENDANGERS

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:52.955
PUBLIC SAFETY. I HAVE

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:56.092
CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT.

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:58.094
HAVE SAID THEIR PERSONAL

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.763
FREEDOM HAS BEEN CHALLENGED

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:01.964
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CHILD WITH

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:04.200
AN AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE OR IN IN

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:07.203
THE PROCESS OF RECEIVING CANCER

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.770
TREATMENTS WERE THEIR IMMUNE

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.872
SYSTEM HAS BEEN. ADVERSELY

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:14.076
IMPACTED THEY CAN'T SEND THEIR

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:16.545
CHILD TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:18.614
THEIR TAXES ARE SUPPORTING

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:21.083
BECAUSE THE IMMUNE RATE THE

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:23.419
VACCINIA VACCINATION RATE AT

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.421
THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL HAS DROPPED

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:28.257
IN SOME CASES THE 70% OR BELOW

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:30.459
SO THEIR PERSONAL FREEDOM THAT

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:33.429
I WAS ALSO ELECTED TO PROTECT

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:34.530
IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH THAT I WAS

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.132
SELECTED TO PROTECT WE'RE

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:37.066
TELLING THEM YOU'RE PAYING

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:39.368
TAXES TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:42.405
THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT BECAUSE

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:42.972
OF THE EXERCISE OF PERSONAL

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:47.443
BELIEF. NOT MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:50.613
THAT CONSTITUENT IS HAVING

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.515
THEIR PERSONAL BELIEFS AND

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.750
THEIR RIGHT TO PUBLIC HEALTH IN

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:55.818
A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:58.054
CHILD TO BE EDUCATED THAT'S

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.390
BEING ABRIDGED THIS BILL SEEKS

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.892
TO FIND THAT BALANCE I BELIEVE

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.560
THE AMENDMENTS IN THE

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:05.661
ENGAGEMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:08.731

ARTICULATED BY THE AUTHOR.

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:14.937
PROVIDE A PATH. WHERE A FAMILY

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:17.840
IN THEIR PHYSICIAN CAN DISCUSS

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:20.743
WHETHER THEIR CHILD SHOULD BE

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.279
AFFORDED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:24.980
AND AS SOON AS THAT DR GRANT

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:29.185
SAT MEDICAL EXEMPTION. IT. IT

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:31.587
ENGAGES A FURTHER PROCESS WITH

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.789
OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:34.924
BUT THAT CHILD IMMEDIATELY HAS

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.159
THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:39.495
THERE'S CHECKS AND BALANCES

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:42.965
THEY INDEED PROTECT. PERSONAL

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:47.036
RIGHTS OF ALL CONSTITUENTS OF

PERSONAL BELIEF PROTECTIONS

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.744
COLLEAGUES. THEY ARE NOT

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:57.213
ABSOLUTE IF THE EXERCISE OF

01:06:57.279 --> 01:07:00.049
YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS. THE

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:02.952
BRIDGE IS THE RIGHT OF MY CHILD

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:05.521
TO GO TO A CLASSROOM THAT WE

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.990
HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT AS MUCH

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:09.525
AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE USE OF

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:13.095
SCIENCE. ANY USE OF

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:15.364
IMMUNIZATIONS TO MAKE OUR

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:18.100

INITIAL PASS. I ROSE IN SUPPORT

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:41.157
BUT WITH SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:42.958
SOME OF THE ISSUE THURMOND

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:43.492
DISCUSSION FOR HERE TODAY

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.861

AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS AND

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:52.034
WHETHER THE CDC GUIDELINES WERE

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:55.604
EXPANSIVE ENOUGH. FIRST OF ALL

WHO HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.961
BILL. SETTING SOME STANDARD

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:21.497
DECORUM HERE EVEN THE ADVOCATES

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.799
WHOSE SO VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE IT.

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:26.936
WE CAN'T ACCEPT VIOLENCE AS OUR.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.504
AS OUR CURRENCY IN OUR POLITICS

01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:33.275
WERE ABOVE THAT. BUT I DO WANT

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:33.742
TO THANK THE COUNTLESS

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:36.145
CONSTITUENTS WHO VISITED IN MY

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.714
OFFICE AND SAT WITH ME FOR MANY

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.117
HOURS IT EDUCATING ME ABOUT.

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:44.153
THEIR CONCERNS THEIR HOPES

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.387
THEIR FEARS INTRODUCING ME TO

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:47.723
THEIR KIDS. A LOT OF VERY

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:51.093
STRONG MOMS IN PARTICULAR.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.496
BEHIND THIS EFFORT AND IT'S

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:58.501
BEEN MOVING. BECAUSE OF SOME

01:08:58.567 --> 01:08:59.468
THAT EDUCATION I STILL DO HAVE

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.136
SOME CONCERNS AND WAS

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.005
ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT THE

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:03.939
GOVERNOR WILL BE ENGAGING ON

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.641
THIS EFFORT TO MAKE SOME

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.309
TECHNICAL CLARIFICATIONS THAT I

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:09.311
THINK WILL MAKE THIS BILL

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:10.312
WORKABLE AND MAKE SURE THAT NO

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.414
CALIFORNIAN IS FORCED TO

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.183
VACCINATE THEIR CHILD IF IT'S

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.919
GOING TO CAUSE THAT CHILD HARM.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.787
PERIOD THAT SHOULD NOT BE

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:19.455
SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT FORCES

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.824
UPON A PERSON HERE. AND I

01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:25.661
BELIEVE THAT IS YOUR INTENT DR.

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:26.929
I HAVE SOME. SOME OF THOSE

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.498
TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT. STILL

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:32.868
pBE ADDRESSED AS WE MOVE

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:36.272
FORWARD. THE TRIGGER OF FIVE

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.641
EXEMPTIONS PER YEAR FOR ONE

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:39.475
DOCTORED TO CALL THAT

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.744
EXCESSIVE. FEELS A LITTLE

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:45.714
ARBITRARY FOR ME. BUT I THINK

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:50.019
THERE'S ROOM TO WORK ON THAT.

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:51.554
THE 95% IMMUNITY RATE THAT

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.555
TRIGGERS THAT A THAT REVIEW I'M

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:53.889
I KNOW THERE ARE SOME SOME

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:55.457
TECHNICAL ISSUES TO WORK OUT

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.493
THERE. AND I KNOW THAT THIS

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.129
ISSUE STANDARD OF CARE IS

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:01.964
ACTUALLY QUITE A MEANINGFUL

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.333
ENHANCEMENT OF WHAT WE HAD

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.102
PRIOR BUT THERE IS STILL.

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:09.805
DISCRETION THAN THAT NOW CITY

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:10.439
PH WON'T HAVE CARTE BLANCHE TO

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:13.108
MAKE IT UP OR DOWN VOTE. ON A

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.577
FAMILIES VERY PERSONAL

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:19.815
DECISION. THAT THEY WILL. HAVE

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:24.820
NOW THE CONSULTATION OF DOCTORS.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:25.988
AND ABIDING BY SOME STANDARD

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.123
CARE THAT. EXCEEDS THE SORT OF

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.124
OBJECTIVE AND RIGID STANDARDS

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:33.495
SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.230
MEASURE TODAY BUT WITH THE

01:10:35.297 --> 01:10:38.133
HOPES THAT IT IN THE SUBSEQUENT.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.603
WE CAN HALF THAT WE'VE GOT HERE

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:41.971
THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME PROGRESS

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:44.840
IN REALLY REALLY FOLLOW THROUGH

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.075
ON THOSE ASSURANCES THAT WERE

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:47.443
MAKING A PARENTS AROUND THE

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:50.312
STATE. WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE.

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:55.284
CONCERNS AND WELL FOUNDED FEAR

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:55.884
WHEN THINGS COME IN SACRAMENTO

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.820
THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.288
THAT THE INTENT OF THIS

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:01.390
LEGISLATURE'S NOT TO GET

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:02.257
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR ARE

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:04.827
YOU AND YOUR CHILD IT'S TO MAKE

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:05.461
SURE THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY ARE

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:09.398
SAFE. WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:12.101
SERIOUS MEDICAL ISSUES. BUT

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.636
THAT A PREFERENCE IS NOT

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:19.008
ENOUGH. THAT A PERSONAL BELIEF.

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:19.642
IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THERE

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:21.944
HAS TO BE SOME MEDICAL BASIS.

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:24.313
SO I'M HOPING WE CAN FIND THAT

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.381
THAT LANDING SPOT I KNOW THIS

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:28.250
IS BEEN HARD. BUT MOST OF ALL I

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:29.451
JUST I APPRECIATE WITH THESE

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:30.486
BODIES DONE TODAY IN THE

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:33.122
DEBATE. AND CHECKING OURSELVES

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:34.556
IN MAKING SURE THIS A PLACE

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:36.992
WHERE WE CAN FEEL SAFE TO MAKE

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.094
GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. THANK YOU.

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:43.799
THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI.

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:44.533
THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.134
AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR I

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.035
INITIALLY DIDN'T SUPPORT THE

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:49.171
BILL BECAUSE I WANTED TO INSURE

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.305
THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF A

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:52.675
TEAM TASK FORCE. THAT WOULD BE

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:55.177
ABLE TO REVIEW APPEALS. I WILL

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.378
BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:58.647
BUT I WISH TO EXPRESS ONE LAST

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.516
CONCERNED THAT I DO THINK IS

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:03.018
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THE PART

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:04.853
THE AMENDMENT WITH REGARD TO

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.922
ADD A PHYSICIAN AND THAT HAS

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.224
FIVE OR MORE EXEMPTIONS. MY

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:13.328
FEAR IS THAT. THIS MIGHT CREATE

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.630
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I'M A

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.265
PHYSICIAN WOULD BE HAS A TENT.

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:18.634
TO GRANT AN EXEMPTION AND I

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:19.802
THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:21.904
IT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. MY

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:24.206
COUSIN IN ARIZONA IS A

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.542
PHYSICIAN WHO IS AN EXPERT. ON

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:28.777
VALLEY FEVER AND HE IS ONE OF

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.245
THE FEW IN THE NATION WHO HAS

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:31.747
STUDIED VALLEY FEVER FOR

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:33.515
DECADES IT HAS BEEN HIS LIFE'S

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:35.718
WORK. I BELIEVE THEY'RE

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:36.819
PROBABLY PHYSICIANS OUT THERE

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:40.122
WHO ARE. MUCH MORE EXPERT IN

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:43.358
THIS AREA THAN OTHERS ARE AND I

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:44.927
WOULD THINK THAT IF I WAS OF A

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:46.995
FAMILY APPARENT TO HAD A CHILD

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:48.530
THAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT. THAT

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:51.533
I WOULD SEEK OUT AN EXPERT. WHO

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.236
HAS MORE KNOWLEDGE IN THIS

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:56.238
FIELD THEN AN AVERAGE DOCTOR.

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:58.207
AND I THINK THAT THAT PARENTS

01:12:58.273 --> 01:12:59.775
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO SEE

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.944
THOSE EXPERTS AND I THINK THAT

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:04.079
THOSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE A. B.

01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:06.014
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO. DELVE

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:08.650
INTO THIS ARENA AND TO WORK

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:09.985
CLOSELY WITH THE FAMILIES. SO

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:15.290
THAT MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS ARE

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:15.891
MADE AND SO THAT WE DO BETTER

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:21.430
UNDERSTAND. THOSE SITUATIONS

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.298
THOSE MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS THAT

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:24.466
DEALING WILL EXIST AND I ASSUME

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:25.534
THAT THERE WILL BE SOME THAT WE

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:26.201
CAN'T PREDICT WITH THIS

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.169
LEGISLATION. AND THAT WE WILL

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.771
NEED TO RELY ON THE MEDICAL

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:31.073
EXPERTISE OF THOSE PHYSICIANS

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.975
WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO GRANT

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.977
MORE THAN FIVE EXEMPTIONS AND

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.612
WE SHOULD. MEET THEM WITH THAT

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.981
SPIRIT SO I WOULD ASK THAT

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:43.952
GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:48.524

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.095
JUST MAKE A FEW NOTES BASED ON

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:28.030
SOME THE COMMON PEOPLE MADE ON

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:29.264
THE BILL AND PARTICULARLY THE

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:30.666
AMENDMENTS SO FIRST OF ALL I

PROCESS FOR EXEMPTION I WOULD

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.538
MAKE NOTE THAT ALSO THAT

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.173
PROCESS ONLY ACTUALLY CHECKS

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.576
IN. IF THEY'RE ATTENDING SCHOOL

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:43.445
UNDER 95% OR THE PHYSICIAN HAS

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:45.714
WRITTEN MORE THAN FIVE

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:47.749
EXEMPTION SO IN OTHER WORDS IF

THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IRONTON

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:52.154
PLAY THEY WERE TO TURN

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.956
EXEMPTION AND EXEMPTION WOULD

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:55.424
NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND THAT

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.092
WOULD BASICALLY BE THOUSAND SO

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.126
IFYOU'RE ATTENDING A SCHOOL

01:14:58.193 --> 01:15:00.829
WHERE THE NIGHT YOU HAVE A 95%

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.197
OR ABOVE WHICH MEANS WE HAVE.

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:02.865
TO MEDIUM UNITY WE'RE NOT

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:05.400
WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY NOT A

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:07.169
PROBLEM RIGHT SO WHAT BUT IT

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.871
WON'T BE ME GOING THROUGH THE

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:14.643
WHOLE REVIEW. PROCESS THE OTHER

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.244
THING I WOULD MAKE NOTE AND I

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:25.921
APPRECIATE. BUT ALSO I KNOW MY

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:26.455
COLLEAGUES ARE THEY'RE NOT

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:30.359
AFRAID OF REVIEW. OKAY AND IN

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:31.693
FACT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.262
TERMS OF SPECIALISTS THE

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:35.197
ONCOLOGISTS TO ACTUALLY WOULD

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.365
BE IN A POSITION PERHAPS RIGHT

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:38.834
MORE THAN FIVE THE ALLERGIST

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:40.269
IMMUNOLOGIST TO TAKE CARE OF

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:43.205
SOME WITHOUT IMMUNE DISEASE

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:43.805
THEY SUPPORT THE BILL. THEY'RE

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:44.306
NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.742
SCRUTINY. THEY WELCOME IT.

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:48.443
BECAUSE IT'S THEIR PATIENTS WHO

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:49.912
ARE ENDANGERED WHEN SOMEONE

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.680
ELSE WRITES AN APPROPRIATE

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:52.881
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THAT'S WHY

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.249
THEY'RE FINE WITH IT. NOW WE

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.284
WANT TO REVIEW MY EXEMPTIONS

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:57.486
I'M GOOD WITH THAT. AND I THINK

01:15:57.552 --> 01:15:58.053
THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.455
KEEP IN MIND. I WOULD ALSO WAS

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:01.023
MENTIONED ABOUT THE MEDICAL

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:05.060
BOARD. THE MEDICAL BOARD WHAT'S

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:06.395
THIS BILL THEY HAVE VOTED TO

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:08.931
SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:09.798
UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:12.067
BEEN GIVEN THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:12.501
TO DO THE KIND OF

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:14.603
INVESTIGATIONS TO GO AFTER IS

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:15.871
PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE SAY THE BAD

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:16.805
DOCTORS OF THE DOCTORS ARE

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:19.174
ABUSING THEIR- AUTHORITY AND SO

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.210
THE MEDICAL BOARD WANTS US TO

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:22.744
PASS THIS BILL SO THEY CAN

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:25.881
ACTUALLY ACT AND DO THEIR JOB.

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.616
I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE OF THAT

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:32.854
YOU KNOW. WE ALL WANT FREEDOM

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.456
WE WANT TO FEED ON THE ABOUT BE

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.757
ABLE TO GO ABOUT OUR

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:36.625
COMMUNITIES IN THE SAFE NOT

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.694
WORRY ABOUT HAVING TO CATCH A

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.829
DANGEROUS DISEASE OURSELVES.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:44.666
OUR CHILDREN ARE BABIES. WE ALL

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.034
WANT THE FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:46.969
SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL AND

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:48.870
NO THEY'LL BE SAFE AND SO THIS

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.540
BILL AGAIN IS ABOUT BEING SURE

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:52.774
THAT THE CHILDREN WHO REALLY

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.343
NEED THE MEDICAL SENTIENCE AND

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.677
THEREFORE CANNOT BE VACCINATED

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:56.878
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IF THEY

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:57.980
HAVE THE PROTECTION OF THE

01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:00.215
OTHERS IN THE SCHOOL. AND SO I

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.483
THINK WE TALK ABOUT FREEDOM WE

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:03.452
NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FREEDOM

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:04.920
OF ALL FAMILIES AND ALL

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:07.189

MAKES IT MORE TARGETED. THAT

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:18.266
ADDRESSES MANY OF THE ISSUES

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.735
THAT PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT. I

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:22.170

01:59:43.276 --> 01:59:46.479
WAS A VERY IS A VERY

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:50.883
INTERESTING DEBATE. I DON'T

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:51.851
KNOW MUCH ABOUT CONVERSION

01:59:51.918 --> 01:59:54.554
THERAPY. ON THE AND I DO HAVE A

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:56.289
LOT OF FRIENDS WHO ARE MEMBERS

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:58.658
OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND

01:59:58.724 --> 02:00:00.059
THEY HAVE VERY STRONG MANY OF

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:01.594
THEM HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:04.196
ABOUT THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT.

02:00:04.263 --> 02:00:06.232
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE THEIR

02:00:06.299 --> 02:00:08.734
WORD ON THAT IT IS NOT BEEN

02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:11.237
HELPFUL BUT I WILL JUST SIMPLY

02:00:11.304 --> 02:00:13.306
ADD A WORD OF CAUTION. THAT

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:14.840
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS JUST A

02:00:14.907 --> 02:00:16.909
RESOLUTION IS NOT A SUBSTANTIVE

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:20.479
ON PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:23.649
WE ARE TREADING INTO FREEDOM OF

02:00:23.716 --> 02:00:24.550
SPEECH TERRITORY THAT I THINK

02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:27.086
SHOULD CONCERN ALL OF US. AND

02:00:27.153 --> 02:00:29.355
WHEN I SAY FREEDOM OF SPEECH

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:30.556
AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION THESE

02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:32.658
ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

02:00:32.725 --> 02:00:36.062
AREAS OF OUR OF OUR COUNTRY.

02:00:36.128 --> 02:00:38.764
THAT NGUYEN IN INDIVIDUAL SEEKS

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:40.666
THERAPY OR GUIDANCE ON BEFORE A

02:00:40.733 --> 02:00:43.135
RELIGIOUS LEADER OR A MEMBER OF

02:00:43.202 --> 02:00:44.704
A CONGREGATION WHETHER IT BE A

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:48.574
MOSQUE A TEMPLE OR CHURCH. THAT

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:50.543
THAT IS IN A PRIVATE SETTING IN

02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:53.379
THAT IT IS ALSO VOLUNTEER. AND

02:00:53.446 --> 02:00:56.382
LASTLY THE MEMBERSHIP IN THAT

02:00:56.449 --> 02:00:58.250
ON THAT CONGREGATION IS NOT

02:00:58.317 --> 02:01:02.088
CONDITIONS ON THE SEEKING FOR A

02:01:02.154 --> 02:01:03.656
POSITION OF THAT TREATMENT SO I

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:06.225
THINK WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ITS

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:07.560
VOLUNTARY NATURE IT'S

02:01:07.627 --> 02:01:12.665
CONFIDENTIAL NATURE. I THINK

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:13.265
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REMIND

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:18.771
OURSELVES THAT. WE'RE DEALING

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:20.006
WITH WITH THE FREEDOM OF

02:01:20.072 --> 02:01:22.041
EXPRESSION FREEDOM OF RELIGION.

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:22.842
AND TO DISALLOW OR CREATE THE

02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:23.976
PATHWAY WHERE WE TELL

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:24.543
INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY CANNOT

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:26.012
SAY CERTAIN THINGS. SHOULD GIVE

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:27.647
US PAUSE AND THAT'S ONLY REASON

02:01:27.713 --> 02:01:31.484
WHY WE HAD SUCH I THINK

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:34.754
STRENUOUS DEBATE IN JUDICIARY

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:35.354
ON THIS WAS PRIMARILY ON FIRST

02:01:35.421 --> 02:01:38.157

CONVERSION THERAPY A

02:01:56.976 --> 02:02:00.746
PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE IT IS IT

02:02:00.813 --> 02:02:02.948
HAS ABSOLUTELY NO LEGITIMACY

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:04.250
THERE'S NO SUPPORT FOR THE

02:02:04.316 --> 02:02:07.253
NOTION THAT SOMEONE CAN CHANGE

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:10.256
THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND

02:02:10.322 --> 02:02:13.059
THERE'VE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE ON

02:02:13.125 --> 02:02:16.228
WHO HAD BEEN. BADLY DAMAGED BY

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:18.998
THESE EFFORTS WHICH IS WHY WE

02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:20.599
BANDS CONVERSION THERAPY FOR

02:02:20.666 --> 02:02:23.135
CHILDREN BUT EVEN FOR ADULTS IT

02:02:23.202 --> 02:02:25.971
IS INCREDIBLY DAMAGING WE

02:02:26.038 --> 02:02:27.540
SHOULD NOT BE CONDONING IT WE

02:02:27.606 --> 02:02:30.209
SHOULD BE OPPOSING AT AND I

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:31.277
WILL KNOW THAT YET AGAIN

02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:34.346
RECENTLY YET ANOTHER LEADER IN

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:39.251
THE CONVERSION THERAPY MOVEMENT.

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:39.852
ACKNOWLEDGE A GUESS WHY HE'S A

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:44.790
GAY MAN. AND WE SEE THIS OVER

02:02:44.857 --> 02:02:46.292

02:02:46.358 --> 02:02:48.260
WHO STAR ADVOCATING FOR

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:49.295
CONVERSION THERAPY AND THEN IN

02:02:49.361 --> 02:02:50.229
THE YEAH AND A KNOWLEDGE THAT

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:50.796
IT DOESN'T WORK AND THEY'RE

02:02:50.863 --> 02:02:53.332
STILL LGBT. THIS IS

02:02:53.399 --> 02:02:55.868
PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE WE NEED

02:02:55.935 --> 02:03:00.072
TO REJECT THIS TERRIBLE THING.

02:03:00.139 --> 02:03:01.540
CENTER JACKSON. IT'S THANK YOU

02:03:01.607 --> 02:03:02.575

THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:05.845
JUDICIARY DO WANT TO RESPOND TO

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:07.413
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIM IT'S

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:08.848
A VERY INTERESTING ONE AND

02:03:08.914 --> 02:03:11.450
FRANKLY UNTIL RECENTLY THE

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:12.985
INTERPRETATION OF THE FIRST

02:03:13.052 --> 02:03:14.920
AMENDMENT WAS A ONE RELIGION

02:03:14.987 --> 02:03:16.522
COULD NOT IMPOSE ITSELF ON

02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:19.658
OTHER RELIGIONS. ARE SO IT TOO

02:03:19.725 --> 02:03:21.494
WOULD TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:23.162
THE RULE THAT ONE SHOULD HAVE

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.996
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:25.931
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OTHERS IS

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:27.366
A RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT AND

02:03:27.433 --> 02:03:29.068
HOPEFULLY ONE THAT IN THE

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:30.069
COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS

02:03:30.136 --> 02:03:32.738
WILL BE REJECTED. I IT IS

02:03:32.805 --> 02:03:35.641
ESSENTIALLY A FALSE NARRATIVE

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:37.843
THAT ONE RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVE

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:40.045
SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERMINE THE

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:41.447
PROTECTIONS IN THE RIGHTS THAT

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:43.115
WE HAVE GIVEN TO OTHERS WHO

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:44.483
DON'T NECESSARILY SHARE THAT

02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:46.852
PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS PART OF

02:03:46.919 --> 02:03:48.387
THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:51.490
DURING OUR- HEARING AND TO. THE

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:53.793
NOTION THAT. BY TRYING TO

02:03:53.859 --> 02:03:56.128
PROTECT MEMBERS OF THE LGBT

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:59.398
COMMUNITY FROM OF THE HORRORS

02:03:59.465 --> 02:04:01.433
OF THIS TYPE OF EXPERIENCE IS

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:03.803
NOT. A GRANT THING IT OR DO YOU

02:04:03.869 --> 02:04:05.805
SHOULD NOT BE I HATE TO USE

02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:07.640
WERE TRUMP BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:10.276
OF A BY THOSE WHOSE RELIGION

02:04:10.342 --> 02:04:13.078
SAYS THAT. THAT THOSE WHO ARE

02:04:13.145 --> 02:04:14.280
MEMBERS OF THE LGBT Q.

02:04:14.346 --> 02:04:16.415
COMMUNITY I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:18.317
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THAT WE

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:20.719
HAVE GRANTED THEM BECAUSE ONE.

02:04:20.786 --> 02:04:22.254
OTHER ANOTHER PERSON'S RELIGION

02:04:22.321 --> 02:04:24.690
DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT THE GOAL

02:04:24.757 --> 02:04:26.225
IS TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:28.928
PEOPLE IRRESPECTIVE OF ONE'S

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:34.600
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. AND WITHOUT

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:35.167
I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:42.975

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:05.030
HER SON AND SHE ACCEPTED HIM

02:05:05.097 --> 02:05:06.031
AND LOVED HIM AND HER LOVE

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:08.534
BROUGHT FORTH ACCEPTANCE FROM A

02:05:08.601 --> 02:05:11.370
LARGE ITALIAN CATHOLIC FAMILY

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:14.240

JUMPED TO TODAY AND THERE'S

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:20.880
ACTUALLY SOME. SCHOOLS PRIVATE

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:23.883
SCHOOLS THAT IN THEIR STUDENT

02:05:23.949 --> 02:05:26.318
HANDBOOKS AND PARENT HANDBOOKS

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:28.721
HAVE IT ACTUALLY IN THEIR HAND

02:05:28.787 --> 02:05:30.389
BOOK TO THIS DAY. THAT SAYS IF

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:32.825
A STUDENT FEELS THEMSELVES

02:05:32.892 --> 02:05:34.393
ATTRACTED TO A STUDENT OF THE

02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:36.962
SAME SEX. THAT THE PARENTS AND

02:05:37.029 --> 02:05:40.532
STUDENTS HAVE TO AGREE TO SEND

02:05:40.599 --> 02:05:41.066
THAT STUDENT TO MANDATORY

COUNSELING. THAT'S TODAY AND

02:05:47.172 --> 02:05:48.240
THAT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE AND SO

02:05:48.307 --> 02:05:49.008
WHEN WE DO RESOLUTIONS LIKE

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:50.276
THIS WE CONTINUE TO EDUCATE THE

02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:52.645
GENERAL PUBLIC THAT CONVERSION

02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:55.848
THERAPY IS A SHAM AND WE CAN'T

02:05:55.915 --> 02:05:58.083
FORGET THAT EVEN TODAY THERE

02:05:58.150 --> 02:06:00.085
ARE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

02:06:00.152 --> 02:06:02.788
FINDING SUBTLE WAYS TO SUBJECT

02:06:02.855 --> 02:06:04.123
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE

02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:06.058
LOVED LIKE MY BROTHER WAS LOVED

02:06:06.125 --> 02:06:08.861
BY MY MOM AND NOT FORCED INTO

OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.208
MENTAL HEALTH. I'D HAVE TO SAY

02:06:23.275 --> 02:06:25.844
THAT CONSIDERING THIS A MENTAL

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:28.614
HEALTH PRACTICE. I WOULD

02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:29.515
CONSIDER IT MENTAL HEALTH

02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:32.718
MALPRACTICE. AND I THINK THAT

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:36.422
JOB. WE SHOULD NOT A- COMPARE

02:06:36.488 --> 02:06:40.326
THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND OF

02:06:40.392 --> 02:06:42.461
FREEDOM OF RELIGION WITH

02:06:42.528 --> 02:06:45.664
MEDICAL APPROACHES THAT HAVE

02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:48.067
BEEN PROVEN TO BE DISREPUTABLE

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:50.736
AND WE SHOULD URGE ADOPTION OF

02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:52.004

WRONG DIRECTION SO I HEARD

THAT SEXUALITY IS A COMPLEX MIX

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:34.546
AND SO I BELIEVE IN THIS AREA

02:07:34.613 --> 02:07:36.248
WE'RE TALKING PERHAPS ABOUT TWO

02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:38.217

TALKING ABOUT SPIRITUAL

02:07:52.064 --> 02:07:54.400

02:07:56.101 --> 02:07:57.970

COLLEAGUE THAT THERE WAS A BILL

02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:59.631

02:24:27.658 --> 02:24:29.994
WHO ARE OTHERWISE LESS INCLINED

02:24:30.061 --> 02:24:32.663
OR ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THE GREAT

02:24:32.730 --> 02:24:34.532
OUTDOORS AND I WANT TO SHARE

02:24:34.599 --> 02:24:35.566
THAT THE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS

02:24:35.633 --> 02:24:38.503
WITH YOU. A REPRESENT AN AREA

02:24:38.569 --> 02:24:41.172
IN THE CITY OF VENTURA. WHERE

02:24:41.239 --> 02:24:43.141
IT'S- A VERY VERY POOR AND

02:24:43.207 --> 02:24:44.709
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY LIVES

02:24:44.776 --> 02:24:45.877
IT'S CALLED THE AVENUE OF INTER

02:24:45.943 --> 02:24:48.446
AVENUE MANY YEARS AGO I WENT

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:51.549
AND SPOKE TO THE- OF FOLKS WHO

02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:53.684
DO THE EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS

02:24:53.751 --> 02:24:55.153
THERE AND ASKED THEM IF THEY

02:24:55.219 --> 02:24:57.588
HAD. RESOURCES WHAT IS THE

02:24:57.655 --> 02:25:02.827
NUMBER ONE THING THEY WOULD. DO

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:03.428
WITH THOSE RESOURCES FOR THEIR

02:25:03.494 --> 02:25:10.268
KIDS. AND I FOUND THEIR ANSWER

02:25:10.334 --> 02:25:12.270
TO BE QUITE ASTONISHING. THEY

02:25:12.336 --> 02:25:12.837
SAID THEY WOULD TAKE A FIELD

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:17.275
TRIP TO THE OCEAN. A FIELD TRIP

02:25:17.341 --> 02:25:18.676
TO THE OCEAN THE OCEAN

02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:19.510
COLLEAGUES IS TWO MILES FROM

02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:21.879
THE SCHOOL. BUT BECAUSE THESE

02:25:21.946 --> 02:25:25.850
KIDS. HAVE NEVER HAD THE

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:28.286
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE THE

02:25:28.352 --> 02:25:30.254
OCEAN THEIR PARENTS ARE WORKING

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:31.322
SO MUCH THEY DON'T HAVE

02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:34.425
TRANSPORTATION THEY HAD NEVER

02:25:34.492 --> 02:25:37.028
BEEN TO THE OCEAN WHICH WAS TWO

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:40.665
MILES AWAY. SO I THINK THIS

02:25:40.731 --> 02:25:42.633
BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I

02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:44.202

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:45.369
THE EFFORTS THAT SOME ARE

02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:49.173

IS GIVING YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

02:26:27.044 --> 02:26:27.678

IT'S REALLY ABOUT ACCESSING

02:26:41.058 --> 02:26:42.326
THAT NUMBER TWO IS THAT THERE

02:26:42.393 --> 02:26:44.028
WAS A STUDY DONE RECENTLY THAT

02:26:44.095 --> 02:26:46.197
TALKED ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:48.633
BEING AROUND TREES AND I KNOW

02:26:48.699 --> 02:26:50.635
THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT TRITE

02:26:50.701 --> 02:26:52.803
BUT WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT IT

02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:56.107
THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE PART

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:59.043

THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE WAS

02:27:11.923 --> 02:27:12.924
LOWERED THEIR JOB THEY THERE

REALLY ABOUT IN A DAY AND AGE

02:27:19.497 --> 02:27:20.498

FROM THIS ASSAULT ON OUR

ENVIRONMENT WITH THAT I WOULD

04:30:21.271 --> 04:30:21.772
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE

04:30:25.642 --> 04:30:28.378

04:30:28.445 --> 04:30:28.979
THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT OF

04:30:29.046 --> 04:30:32.983
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. IN

04:30:33.050 --> 04:30:36.353
THE IDEA OF NEW LEASE IS THAT

04:30:36.420 --> 04:30:36.887
THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A

04:30:36.954 --> 04:30:41.592
RENEWAL. IF ANYONE KNOWS

04:30:41.658 --> 04:30:42.225
OTHERWISE I'D LOVE TO HEAR THAT

04:30:42.292 --> 04:30:44.695
BUT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING.

04:30:44.761 --> 04:30:46.964
AND SO I'M TRYING TO MAKE SENSE

04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:49.900
OF IF WE HAVE EXISTING DRILLING

04:30:49.967 --> 04:30:51.468
GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT LEASE

04:30:51.535 --> 04:30:55.339
IS IN PLACE. WHEN IT COMES UP

04:30:55.405 --> 04:30:55.973
FOR RENEWAL THIS WOULD DISALLOW

04:30:56.039 --> 04:30:59.009
THAT. SO I THINK WE WILL LAY

04:30:59.076 --> 04:31:01.979
THE DISCUSSION YESTERDAY ON THE

04:31:02.045 --> 04:31:04.014
FUTURE OF FOSSIL FUEL

04:31:04.081 --> 04:31:05.449
INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA AND

04:31:05.515 --> 04:31:06.350
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE

04:31:06.416 --> 04:31:08.785
IMPORTATION. FROM LESS THAN

04:31:08.852 --> 04:31:10.787
DESIRABLE COUNTRIES AROUND THE

04:31:10.854 --> 04:31:13.624
WORLD INTO OUR ECONOMY. BUT I

04:31:13.690 --> 04:31:14.825
THINK IF WE IF WE THINK THIS

04:31:14.891 --> 04:31:16.727
THING THROUGH. THIS COULD HAVE

04:31:16.793 --> 04:31:18.962
DIRE CONSEQUENCES IN COMPLETELY

04:31:19.029 --> 04:31:23.900
RUN OUT OF BUSINESS FOLKS IN IN

04:31:23.967 --> 04:31:26.970
THE FUEL INDUSTRY. SO THAT IS

04:31:27.037 --> 04:31:28.505
MY CONCERN AND I'D I'D I DON'T

04:31:28.572 --> 04:31:30.741
UNDERSTAND. THIS IS A

04:31:30.807 --> 04:31:34.811
RELENTLESS PUSH TO DRIVE THIS

04:31:34.878 --> 04:31:35.278
ENTIRE INDUSTRY OUT OF

04:31:35.345 --> 04:31:38.615
CALIFORNIA. BUT LITERALLY WE

04:31:38.682 --> 04:31:40.717
HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE LAW FUNDS

04:31:40.784 --> 04:31:42.519
ABILITY WE'RE GOING TO GET IT

04:31:42.586 --> 04:31:45.288
ELSEWHERE. AND I JUST DON'T I

04:31:45.355 --> 04:31:47.457
DON'T SEE THE MERIT IN THIS IF

04:31:47.524 --> 04:31:49.459
THEY'RE ABIDING BY THE RULES

04:31:49.526 --> 04:31:50.827
AND THEIR EXTRACTING IN

04:31:50.894 --> 04:31:52.529
CONFORMITY WITH OUR SAFETY

04:31:52.596 --> 04:31:53.930
PROTOCOLS IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

04:31:53.997 --> 04:31:55.532
CONCERNS WHY ARE WE ARE

04:31:55.599 --> 04:31:57.100
PUNISHING THEM AND FORCING THEM

04:31:57.167 --> 04:31:58.468
OUT OF BUSINESS. SO I THINK

04:31:58.535 --> 04:32:01.838
THIS IS OF GRAVE CONCERN EVEN

04:32:01.905 --> 04:32:02.305
THOUGH IT'S COUCHED IN

04:32:02.372 --> 04:32:05.909
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

04:32:05.976 --> 04:32:10.547
CENTER GIRL. THANK YOU MISTER

04:32:10.614 --> 04:32:12.182
PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION

04:32:12.249 --> 04:32:14.317
OF THIS BILL AGAIN YESTERDAY WE

04:32:14.384 --> 04:32:16.687
HAD A VERY BROAD DISCUSSION ON

04:32:16.753 --> 04:32:18.689
ON OIL AND CALIFORNIA'S

04:32:18.755 --> 04:32:20.090
CONSUMPTION INCREASES OF GONNA

04:32:20.157 --> 04:32:21.158
HAPPEN WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE A

04:32:21.224 --> 04:32:23.160
PLACE TO BUILD TO PRODUCE IT

04:32:23.226 --> 04:32:23.627
UNDER THE MAASTRICHT

04:32:23.694 --> 04:32:25.796
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY EVER WE

04:32:25.862 --> 04:32:27.931
HAD THAT CONVERSATION YESTERDAY

04:32:27.998 --> 04:32:30.467
BUT TO ADD TO THIS 45% OF

04:32:30.534 --> 04:32:31.735
CALIFORNIA IS OWNED BY THE

04:32:31.802 --> 04:32:33.236
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO YOU'RE

04:32:33.303 --> 04:32:34.271
BASICALLY ELIMINATING THE

04:32:34.337 --> 04:32:36.840
ENTIRE CENTRAL VALLEY AND ALL

04:32:36.907 --> 04:32:37.708
THE WAY AT THE CENTER OF

04:32:37.774 --> 04:32:39.676
CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU JUST TAKE.

04:32:39.743 --> 04:32:41.778
ON A MAP AND YOU TAKE THE

04:32:41.845 --> 04:32:43.380
OUTLINE OF THE COASTAL AREA

04:32:43.447 --> 04:32:44.581
ACROSS THE TOP OF CALIFORNIAN

04:32:44.648 --> 04:32:47.150
AND DOWN TOWARDS NEVADA ARIZONA

04:32:47.217 --> 04:32:47.684
AND THEN DOWN AT THE VERY

04:32:47.751 --> 04:32:50.287
BOTTOM SANDIEGO THAT'S

04:32:50.353 --> 04:32:52.055
EVERYTHING IN THE MIDDLE IS

04:32:52.122 --> 04:32:52.889
OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

04:32:52.956 --> 04:32:54.691
SO YOU WOULD BE LIMITING

04:32:54.758 --> 04:32:56.760
DRILLING AND PRODUCTION AGAIN

04:32:56.827 --> 04:32:58.128
UNDER THE SAFEST ENVIRONMENTAL

04:32:58.195 --> 04:33:00.497
QUALITY PER PRODUCED IN THE

04:33:00.564 --> 04:33:03.233
ENTIRE WORLD. IS A DEFINITELY

04:33:03.300 --> 04:33:06.403
THE NATION SO HOW MY COMMENTS

04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:08.939
OF A LINE WITH WHAT MY

04:33:09.005 --> 04:33:12.375
COLLEAGUE SAID FROM FRESNO THAT

04:33:12.442 --> 04:33:14.177
YOU KNOW WE HAVE LEASES AND

04:33:14.244 --> 04:33:15.412
WHEN THEY GO THROUGH PERMIT

04:33:15.479 --> 04:33:16.847
PROCESSING FOR THE DIVISION OF

04:33:16.913 --> 04:33:18.081
OIL AND GAS AND GEOTHERMAL

04:33:18.148 --> 04:33:20.317
RESOURCES A LOT OF THESE LANDS

04:33:20.383 --> 04:33:22.119
HAVE SURFACED RIGHTS AND

04:33:22.185 --> 04:33:24.121
MINERAL RIGHTS AND THEY BECOME

04:33:24.187 --> 04:33:26.389
TO DIFFERENT OWNERS SO MAYBE BE

04:33:26.456 --> 04:33:28.024
A LIMB IS THE SURFACE RIGHT ON

04:33:28.091 --> 04:33:29.493
BUT THE MINERAL RIGHT OWNER

04:33:29.559 --> 04:33:31.628
BELONGS TO AN EVEN BE NATURAL

04:33:31.695 --> 04:33:33.897
RESOURCES ARE A CHEVRON. THEN

04:33:33.964 --> 04:33:34.765
THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO GET A

04:33:34.831 --> 04:33:36.633
LOCAL DOCTOR APPROVAL AND TO

04:33:36.700 --> 04:33:38.168
GET APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL

04:33:38.235 --> 04:33:39.436
GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO DRILL

04:33:39.503 --> 04:33:41.571
ON THESE LANDS SO IT'S A DOUBLE

04:33:41.638 --> 04:33:44.508
PERMIT PROCESS AND AS WE

04:33:44.574 --> 04:33:45.976
DISCUSS DAGR YESTERDAY THERE IN

04:33:46.042 --> 04:33:47.978
INDUSTRY FUNDED ORGANIZATION

04:33:48.044 --> 04:33:49.713
THEY HAVE THE APPLICANT HAS TO

04:33:49.780 --> 04:33:52.582
APPLY FOR A PERMIT IN ORDER TO

04:33:52.649 --> 04:33:54.084
GET A DRILLING PERMIT AND THEN

04:33:54.151 --> 04:33:55.652
WHEN THEY GET A DRILLING PERMIT

04:33:55.719 --> 04:33:57.053
IT SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:33:57.120 --> 04:33:58.522
WATER RESOURCES FOR APPROVAL IT

04:33:58.588 --> 04:34:00.557
SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AND

04:34:00.624 --> 04:34:01.958
THE AIR QUALITY CONTROL BOARD

04:34:02.025 --> 04:34:03.460
FOR APPROVAL THEM BACK TO

04:34:03.527 --> 04:34:05.162
DOCTOR AND THEN THE APPLICANT

04:34:05.228 --> 04:34:07.197
HAS TO INDEMNIFY DAGR. WITH A

04:34:07.264 --> 04:34:10.934
BOND SO THAT WHEN THEY GET SUED

04:34:11.001 --> 04:34:11.535
BY THE- CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL

04:34:11.601 --> 04:34:16.473
DIVERSITY YOUR. THE

04:34:16.540 --> 04:34:17.407
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THAT. THE

04:34:17.474 --> 04:34:18.041
DOCTOR DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR

04:34:18.108 --> 04:34:18.642
THAT THE APPLICANT DOES WHEN

04:34:18.708 --> 04:34:19.276
THEY'RE DONE THEIR DUE PROCESS.

04:34:19.342 --> 04:34:19.943
THIS IS A BLATANT ATTACK ON THE

04:34:20.010 --> 04:34:20.977
OIL INDUSTRY AND- AGAIN WE AS

04:34:21.044 --> 04:34:23.013
CALIFORNIANS HAVE NOT STOPPED

04:34:23.079 --> 04:34:25.849
THE CONSUMPTION. WE CONTINUALLY

04:34:25.916 --> 04:34:27.617
INCREASE OUR USE OF CONSUMPTION

04:34:27.684 --> 04:34:29.753
ON OIL. BUT WE ARE IMPORTING

04:34:29.820 --> 04:34:31.688
THAT FROM FOREIGN NATIONS THAT

04:34:31.755 --> 04:34:33.256
ARE NOT BENEFICIAL TO AS

04:34:33.323 --> 04:34:35.325
EITHER. FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL

04:34:35.392 --> 04:34:36.960
STANDPOINT OR A CIVIL RIGHTS

04:34:37.027 --> 04:34:38.628
STANDPOINT. AND I WOULD JUST

04:34:38.695 --> 04:34:41.264
ASK THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE

04:34:41.331 --> 04:34:43.333
AMOUNT OF FEDERAL LANDS THAT

04:34:43.400 --> 04:34:44.768
ARE OWNED. BY THE FEDERAL

04:34:44.835 --> 04:34:45.936
GOVERNMENT AND WHERE THIS

04:34:46.002 --> 04:34:48.405
RESTRICTS US FROM BEING ABLE TO

04:34:48.471 --> 04:34:50.173
PRODUCE OIL AGAIN UNDER THE

04:34:50.240 --> 04:34:52.776
STRICTEST. MOST ENVIRONMENTAL

04:34:52.843 --> 04:34:54.744
QUALITY REGULATORY PROCESSES

04:34:54.811 --> 04:34:56.413
EVER. WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT

04:34:56.479 --> 04:34:58.882
BUNKER FUEL I BELIEVE. AND

04:34:58.949 --> 04:35:00.317
THOSE VESSELS THAT BRING THAT

04:35:00.383 --> 04:35:02.085
OIL TO US BECAUSE WE CONTINUE

04:35:02.152 --> 04:35:03.753
TO CONSUME IT WHEN IT WHEN IT

04:35:03.820 --> 04:35:05.155
ARRIVES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO

04:35:05.222 --> 04:35:06.623
BAY WE EXPORT A HUNDRED TWENTY

04:35:06.690 --> 04:35:09.292
MILLION DOLLARS. OFF OF THAT

04:35:09.359 --> 04:35:10.861
PARTICULAR VESSEL AND THE COST

04:35:10.927 --> 04:35:12.596
TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. AND NOT

04:35:12.662 --> 04:35:15.565
ONLY THAT COLLEAGUES THE BUNKER

04:35:15.632 --> 04:35:17.968
FUEL THAT IS USED TO BRING THAT

04:35:18.034 --> 04:35:19.502
FUEL TO S. HAS THE HIGHEST

04:35:19.569 --> 04:35:22.138
SULFUR CONTENT. OF ANY FUEL

04:35:22.205 --> 04:35:23.440
EVER AND IF YOU'LL MAYBE THEY

04:35:23.506 --> 04:35:26.343
JUST ONE OF THOSE TRIPS YOU TO

04:35:26.409 --> 04:35:27.544
ELIMINATE ALMOST EVERY TAIL

04:35:27.611 --> 04:35:28.678
PIPE IN THE UNITED STATES OF

04:35:28.745 --> 04:35:32.482
AMERICA. THE WEEK. AND SO I

04:35:32.549 --> 04:35:33.250
THINK IF WE LOOKED AT THIS FROM

04:35:33.316 --> 04:35:34.184
A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE AND WE HAD

04:35:34.251 --> 04:35:35.018
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE.

04:35:35.085 --> 04:35:36.519
DELEGATE PRODUCING JOBS IN

04:35:36.586 --> 04:35:38.388
CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE STRICTEST

04:35:38.455 --> 04:35:40.357
ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS THAT WE

04:35:40.423 --> 04:35:42.025
HAVE IN IF NOT THE NATION THE

04:35:42.092 --> 04:35:43.560
WORLD THIS WOULD BE BETTER FOR

04:35:43.627 --> 04:35:45.362
ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND ADDRESS

04:35:45.428 --> 04:35:50.467
GLOBAL SITUATIONS AS WELL. AND

04:35:50.533 --> 04:35:51.034
I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

04:35:51.101 --> 04:35:56.306
YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU IN

04:35:56.373 --> 04:35:59.776
ADDITION. IN ADDITION

04:35:59.843 --> 04:36:00.677
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS

04:36:00.744 --> 04:36:02.379
ITEM HEARING AND SEEING NINE

04:36:02.445 --> 04:36:02.946

04:36:03.013 --> 04:36:03.446
THANK YOU WELL I WHILE I

04:36:03.513 --> 04:36:04.047
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND

04:36:04.114 --> 04:36:04.648
LOOK FORWARD TO AT SOME POINT

04:36:04.714 --> 04:36:05.181
TALKING ABOUT OIL AND GAS

04:36:05.248 --> 04:36:06.616
EXPLORATION AND GLOBAL CLIMATE

04:36:06.683 --> 04:36:08.685
CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S GOALS

04:36:08.752 --> 04:36:10.487
THEY TRY TO REDUCE OUR USE ON

04:36:10.554 --> 04:36:11.855
OIL THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL

EIGHT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT IT

04:55:39.054 --> 04:55:41.056

FIRE I HOPE TO STAND CORRECTED

04:56:44.319 --> 04:56:45.387
IF THIS IS THAT THIS FACT IS

04:56:45.454 --> 04:56:47.523
NOT TRUE. THAT THERE HAS NEVER

04:57:37.272 --> 04:57:42.411
YOU SENATOR GROW THANK YOU

04:57:42.477 --> 04:57:43.912
MISTER PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN

04:57:43.979 --> 04:57:46.348
SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT

04:57:46.415 --> 04:57:48.884
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BEST A

04:57:48.951 --> 04:57:51.053
SOLUTION TO POVERTY AND BEING A

04:57:51.119 --> 04:57:52.254
JOB AND THEN THE BEST SOLUTION

04:57:52.321 --> 04:57:53.922
TO KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON

04:57:53.989 --> 04:57:55.090
IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE

04:57:55.157 --> 04:57:57.459
A JOB OF TO KEEP THEM OUT OF

04:57:57.526 --> 04:57:58.660
PRISON BECAUSE I THINK THAT

04:57:58.727 --> 04:58:00.929
SHOWS A SELF ACCOUNTABILITY

04:58:00.996 --> 04:58:03.265
THIS WORK IS NOT EASY IT'S HARD

04:58:03.332 --> 04:58:05.701
IT'S ON A FIRE LINE IT'S

04:58:05.767 --> 04:58:07.269
DIGGING TRENCHES IT'S

04:58:07.336 --> 04:58:10.672
SEPARATING BRASH IT'S NOT EASY

04:58:10.739 --> 04:58:12.741
WORK IT'S VERY HARD WORK. AND I

04:58:12.808 --> 04:58:13.875
THINK THAT WHEN THEY FINISH

04:58:13.942 --> 04:58:16.245
THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM THEY HAVE

04:58:16.311 --> 04:58:17.212
DEVELOP SKILLS THAT THEY WOULD

04:58:17.279 --> 04:58:19.114
NORMALLY NOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE

04:58:19.181 --> 04:58:21.483
EXCEPT FOR ON A JOB AND THAT'S

04:58:21.550 --> 04:58:23.018
GETTING UP SHOWING UP ON TIME

04:58:23.085 --> 04:58:24.620
BEING AT WORK ON TIME DOING A

04:58:24.686 --> 04:58:26.955
GOOD JOB AND IT ALSO I THINK

04:58:27.022 --> 04:58:28.223
GIVES THEM A SELF IMPORTANCE OF

04:58:28.290 --> 04:58:29.591
PROTECTING AND SERVING THE

04:58:29.658 --> 04:58:31.326
COMMUNITY BECAUSE WITH FIRE

04:58:31.393 --> 04:58:32.527
LINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEY

04:58:32.594 --> 04:58:34.730
PROTECT HOMES AND PEOPLE'S

04:58:34.796 --> 04:58:36.231
HOMES AND THEIR RESOURCES AND

04:58:36.298 --> 04:58:37.799
WHAT THEY REQUIRED TO BE TAKEN

04:58:37.866 --> 04:58:39.301
NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM

04:58:39.368 --> 04:58:40.102
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ACTUALLY

04:58:40.168 --> 04:58:41.470
GO OUT AND WORK ON THE FIRE

04:58:41.536 --> 04:58:44.406
LINE. AGAIN IT DOES IT PRESENT

04:58:44.473 --> 04:58:46.942
IT PREVENTS RECIDIVISM FROM

04:58:47.009 --> 04:58:48.210
PEOPLE RETURNING ACTUALLY GOING

04:58:48.277 --> 04:58:50.679
BACK TO PRISON AND SO I THINK

04:58:50.746 --> 04:58:52.147
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE

04:58:52.214 --> 04:58:53.715
OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

04:58:53.782 --> 04:58:55.851
AND IT'S A READ SPONSOR BULL

04:58:55.917 --> 04:58:58.387
PIECE OF LEGISLATION IT JUST

04:58:58.453 --> 04:59:00.355
DOESN'T ALLOW CRIMINALS OUT TO

04:59:00.422 --> 04:59:01.556
LET THEM RUN FREE AND DO

04:59:01.623 --> 04:59:04.226
WHATEVER THEY WANT AT ANY TIME

04:59:04.293 --> 04:59:06.328

04:59:09.464 --> 04:59:10.899
THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE PIECE OF

04:59:10.966 --> 04:59:13.368
LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE

04:59:13.435 --> 04:59:14.703
TO WORK IN A WAY AND DEVELOP

04:59:14.770 --> 04:59:19.007

BIG ISSUE ONE ILLEGAL DUMPING.

PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO DO IT

05:09:35.790 --> 05:09:36.791

05:09:36.858 --> 05:09:39.160

OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT WHILE IT

06:47:58.086 --> 06:47:59.454

06:47:59.521 --> 06:48:00.823
ELEMENTS OF PLANNING

06:48:00.889 --> 06:48:01.990
FUNDAMENTALLY THE ROLE OF

06:48:07.830 --> 06:48:08.330
NEVER BE TO FORCE PEOPLE TO

BEEN STRONG. AND SO FOLKS HAVE

06:50:29.805 --> 06:50:31.573
OPTED FOR PERSONAL

06:50:31.640 --> 06:50:33.442
TRANSPORTATION I THINK IN THE

06:50:33.508 --> 06:50:34.209

06:51:06.241 --> 06:51:07.542
WHAT WE NEED TO STRIVE FOR ITS

06:51:07.609 --> 06:51:08.677

WITH THIS WITH THIS SEEKS TO DO

06:51:37.339 --> 06:51:38.507
WITH THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS

06:51:38.573 --> 06:51:40.809
FOCUS ON. TRYING TO MEET OUR

06:51:40.876 --> 06:51:42.711
GREENHOUSE GAS AND TO AND

06:51:42.778 --> 06:51:44.846
POLLUTION REDUCTION GOALS. ARE

06:51:44.913 --> 06:51:46.148
I THINK ACTUALLY I DON'T CENTER

06:51:46.214 --> 06:51:46.782
SKINNER AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN

06:51:46.848 --> 06:51:49.084
WORKING QUITE A BIT ON TRYING

06:51:49.151 --> 06:51:50.585
TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE DO.

06:51:50.652 --> 06:51:53.555
MOVE INTO A TRANSPORTATION.

06:51:53.622 --> 06:51:54.823
REVOLUTION WITH THE GUARDS

06:51:54.890 --> 06:51:55.991
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND OTHERS

06:51:56.058 --> 06:51:58.360
WE DO SO MINDFULLY AND WE DO

06:51:58.427 --> 06:52:03.799
SO. IN A WAY THAT THE THAT

06:52:03.865 --> 06:52:05.934
SEEKS TO REDUCE POLLUTION AND

06:52:06.001 --> 06:52:07.135
THAT COULD BE DONE. BY MAKING

06:52:07.202 --> 06:52:09.871
SURE THAT THOSE VEHICLES ARE

06:52:09.938 --> 06:52:16.178
LOWER ADMITTING THAT THEY MADE.

06:52:16.244 --> 06:52:16.812
ELECTRIC THAT'S ALL PART OF THE

06:52:16.878 --> 06:52:21.950

06:52:22.017 --> 06:52:22.818

06:52:32.127 --> 06:52:32.527
SOMETHING I THINK WE

06:52:32.594 --> 06:52:35.730
