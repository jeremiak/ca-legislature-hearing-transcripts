A SETTLEMENT. WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I WANTED TO START BY FIRST ACCEPTING OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THE GOAL OF SB NINE FIVE EIGHT IS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX AND LIFE THREATENING ILLNESSES WHO NEED. SPECIAL TEA INFUSED OR INJECTED MEDICATIONS ADMINISTERED BY A DOCTOR OR NURSE. SUCH AS CHEMOTHERAPY CAN RECEIVE THE NECESSARY MEDICATION IN A SAFE AND TIMELY MANNER. THE PATIENTS TO RECEIVE THE SPECIALTY MEDICATIONS ARE OFTEN OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS SUCH AS CHILDREN WITH LIFE THREATENING ILLNESSES. OR FRAIL OR ELDERLY ADULTS. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO KEEP THESE MEDICATIONS IN STOCK SO THEY ARE AVAILABLE WHENEVER NEEDED. TRADITIONALLY A PATIENT SEES THEIR DOCTOR FOR ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS. AND BASED ON THE SAME DAY TESTING AND MEDICATION. IS ADMINISTERED BY THE DOCTOR. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SAME DAY TEST MAY LEAD TO THE DOCTOR TO CHANGE THE MEDICATION STRENGTH OR PRESCRIBED A DIFFERENT DRUG ALL TOGETHER. THIS PARTICULARLY APPLIES TO CHILDREN WHO FLUCTUATE IN WEIGHT AND ILLNESS PROGRESSION. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE POLICIES THAT RESTRICT PATIENT ACCESS TO THESE IMPORTANT MEDICATIONS INSTEAD OF ALLOWING. A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TO USE THE MEDICAID THE MEDICATION ON HAND THERE ARE POLICIES THAT REQUIRE DOCTOR TO CALL ON THE HEALTH PLAN. THANKS TO CALL THE HEALTH PLAN'S PREFERRED VENDOR. THE VENDOR THEN SHIPS THE MEDICATION TO THE WELL TO THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER LABELED. SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PATIENT FOR THIS PATIENT THIS PROCESS IS KNOWN AS WHITE BAGGY WHITE BACKING CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY DAY DELAYED TREATMENT WHICH MAY CUT THE PATIENT'S HEALTH AT RISK FOR EXAMPLE IF THE SAME DAY TEST REQUIRES. A DIFFERENT STRENGTH OR DIFFERENT MEDICATION THEN THE MEDICAL PROVIDER MUST RE ORDERED THE MEDICATION AND RESCHEDULE THE APPOINTMENT AS A RESULT THIS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY TREATMENT AND IMPACT. HEALTH OF THE PATIENT. SINCE PREPARE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY FOR V. DAY TREATMENT. THE ARRANGED THE IS THE ARRANGE TIME OFF WORK COORDINATE RIDES AND SCHEDULE BABYSITTERS REQUIRING THE PATIENT TO WAIT FOR THE HEALTH PLAN TO RANGE TO HAVE THE MEDICATION SHIPPED OR NEEDING TO RESCHEDULE THE WHOLE APPOINTMENT BECAUSE THE MEDICATION WAS NOT CORRECT OR DID NOT ARRIVE ON TIME NOT ONLY CAUSES UNDUE STRESS BUT IT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE OVERALL TREATMENT PLAN. WHILE SOME ALLEGE COST SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH WHITE BAGGING IT SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE IS NOT TANGIBLE SAVINGS BUT RATHER A COST SHIFT. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT WHITE BACKING COST HOSPITAL'S OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY. THIS IS BECAUSE WHITE BACKING POLICIES OFTEN REQUIRE PROVIDERS TO SPEND ADDITIONAL TIME COORDINATING COVERAGE WITH THE PATIENTS INSURERS PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER AND DISPENSING PHARMACY. IN ADDITION TO CORRECTING MEDICATION ISSUES AND DISPENSING MEDICATIONS. FINALLY THESE MEDICATIONS ARE SO SPECIALIZED BE REQUIRE COMPLEX HANDLING AND THERE HAVE BEEN EXAMPLES OF DRUGS NOT BEING SHIPPED PROPERLY SAT AND REFRIGERATED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHICH REQUIRED THE FACILITY TO THROW AWAY THE DRUG THAT PATIENT DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR CHEMOTHERAPY WHICH DELAYED CARE AND ALLOWED THE CANCER. AND ALLOW THE CANCER TO PROGRESS THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO PROHIBIT WHITE BAGGING COMPLETELY. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO PUT APPROPRIATE GUARDRAILS AROUND THE PRACTICE TO PREVENT DELAYED CARE. SUBOPTIMAL CARE PATIENT DISTRESS AND UNNECESSARY UNNECESSARY HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. THIS BILL HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT PROTECTING PATIENTS I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO STRIKE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE THAT PROTECTS PATIENTS TODAY WE HAVE MELISSA CHASE WITH VALLEYS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE AND DOCTOR AT DISNEYLAND LEAD A CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS AND RHEUMATOLOGY AT STANFORD IS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OKAY I'M HERE- AS AS YOU NOTED- MANY RESEARCHERS SANTIAGO I'M VICE PRESIDENT DRUG POLICY FOR A HIP- WE ARE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBERS PROVIDE COVERAGE OF HEALTHCARE AND RELATED SERVICES TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS EVERY DAY WE ALL DESERVE ACCESS TO OMPREHENSIVE QUALITY AFFORDABLE COVERAGE IN A HIP IS COMMITTED TO ADVANCING MARKET BASED POLICY SOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THESE GOALS. I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS TO SHARE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE FIFTY EIGHT THE PROBLEM HAS LONG BEEN AND STILL IS THE PRICE OF DRUGS THERE ARE MANY INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES BEING USED TO LOWER THESE COSTS FOR PATIENTS IN SO CALLED WHITE AND BROWN BAGGING. ARE SUMMONED IN THIS TEST EMAIL ADDRESS BRIEFLY BOTH THE SAFETY CONCERNS AND HOW THESE APPROACHES HELP PATIENTS AND PLAN SPONSORS SUCH AS PRIVATE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS UNION PLANS AND OTHERS BEFORE THESE HIGH PRICED MEDICATIONS FOR BACKGROUND LET'S LEVEL SET REALLY PER QUICKLY ON WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY. BEFORE WHITE AND BROWN BAGGING PROCESS BECAME AVAILABLE THE HOSPITAL CLINIC OR PHYSICIAN PURCHASES THE DRUG AND BILLS THE PATIENT'S INSURANCE THIS IS KNOWN AS BUYING AND BILL. WITH THEIR COMPENSATION BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE DRUGS COST WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN FURTHER IN A MOMENT. UNDER WHITE AND BROWN BAGGING PRACTICES THE HOSPITAL CLINICAL POSITION IS PAID ONLY FOR THE SERVICES. THEY PROVIDE NECESSARY TO ADMINISTER THE COSTS- ADMINISTER THE DRUG. AT IN A GROCERY TO RATE TO THE PATIENT BECAUSE THE DRUG IS PROVIDED TO THEM BY A SPECIALLY PHARMACIES SEPARATELY. SO CALLED BROWN BAG INVOLVED ESPECIALLY PHARMACY SHIPPING THE DIRECT ELECTRIC WHICH THE PATIENT. WITH EMBRACE THE BACK ASIAN TO THE PHYSICIAN FOR ADMINISTRATION. BOTH APPROACHES DISRUPT THE LONG ESTABLISHED BY A BILL PRACTICES THAT WERE. AT THE HEART OF THIS BILL. WHICH PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL ARE AIMING TO PROTECT AT THE EXPENSE OF PATIENTS AND PLAN SPONSORS. IT IS IMPORTANT UNDERSCORE THAT HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDERS YOU PATIENT SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT. AND WHAT PATIENTS TO TAKE THESE CRITICAL DRUGS AT THE TIME THEY ARE NEEDED. WE KNOW AS WELL AS ANYONE THE VALUE OF MAINTAINING OF MAINTAINING PATIENT ADHERENCE TO MEDICATION REGIMENS REGIMENS. AND WE WORK VERY HARD TO PREVENT ANY DISRUPTIONS IN CARE. OPPONENTS OF THESE PRACTICES ALLEGE SUCH PRACTICES ARE UNSAFE. THEY ALSO ASSERT THAT SHIPMENTS FOR SPECIALLY PHARMACIES PROVIDERS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO DRUG SECURITY I'M SORRY NEVER CHANGE SUPPLY OF SECURITY ACT. IN OTHER SEAFOOD SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THIS IS PATENTLY FALSE. I IN FACT HOUSEHOLDS GROUP PRACTICES ARE PROVIDED THEIR OWN STORE PRODUCTS IN THE SAME FASHION AND OFTEN DIRECTLY FROM THE SAME SPECIALTY PHARMACIES. DUE TO SAFETY FTA SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. IN OR MANUFACTURE LIMITED DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS. SO WHEN HEALTH INSURERS IMPLANT IMPLEMENT THESE KINDS OF POLICIES THEY ALSO HAVE EXCEPTION PROCESS IN PLACE TO ADDRESS CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVING QUALITY SAFETY MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OR KAREN RUSSIAN. TWO AND A HALF MINUTES YOU'RE TAKING TIME WITH ME OR THE WITNESS RIGHT OKAY MY OVER. YES OKAY WELL THEN I'LL WRAP UP AND SAY ALSO THAT LASTLY- THE OTHER REASON THAT- THISIS ESPECIALLY NECESSARY BECAUSE- THESE COSTS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THESE DRUGS ARE EXPENSIVE AND-THE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO PRICING. AND SPECIALLY PHARMACIES OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PLANS TO FOR DRUGS I OTHERWISE COULD NOT COVER THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVE ON TO BILL HEAD- FROM TE PHARMACEUTICAL CARE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION HIS ON THE PHONE UNFORTUNATELY A FIRST WITNESS ONLY LEFT YOU ONE MINUTE SO. THANK YOU FOR- COMMITTEE BILL THAT WOULD BE TO MAKE TRANSPORTATION PROPONENT THANK- CENTER LAMAR HER EFFORTS TO TRY TO WORK WITH US AND CRAPPIE LANGUAGE MAKES IT MORE PALATABLE APPROACHING THE- BOB. O'CLOCK THE HI ISSUE I THE PREVIOUS WITH THAT WHILE. MORE THAN FIFTY S. FOR THIS FROM IT'S LIKE. COMPLY WITH ALL STATE THE PHARMACY AND STATE FEDERAL LAW- AND IS IT. POSSIBLE THE MARINE. YOU KNOW SAFE QUALITY DRUGS. AND THIS IS. ABOUT SAFETY ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE BILL IMPOSES ON SESAME PHARMACIES SHOULD BE IMPOSED ON HOSPITAL PHARMACIES WELL. POSITIONED SIXTY SHOULD NOT STOP AT THE HOSPITAL. BUT WHATEVER PATIENTS PERCEPTIONS ARE THE REPLY TO THE SPECIALTY PHARMACY. SUPPLY PEOPLE READY TO. IT'LL PROPERTY AND WOULD HAVE. COMMITTEE IF ISN'T ABOUT PENSIONS. WHY WOULD WE NOT ADDRESS STATES MUST LONG MEADOW WRONG POPULATION MEDICARE OUTPATIENT. AND I FIVE FIVE SOME OF THE PART OF ME. WHAT WE CANNOT A ON THE IT'S NOT WITH THE USE SOME OF PLASTIC BUT WE CAN TO LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH. THE- THE BILL OFF. AND SOVEREIGNTY THERE ARE TO GET REGIONAL SOLUTION THANK FOR FRANK FACES MUCH ALL RIGHT WELL NOW MOVES TO THIS WITNESSES AN OPERA- ESPINO FIFTY EIGHT- PLEASE APPROACH. SEE ONE COMING BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE. IN LATE OPPOSE WHICH WE REGRET- BUT WE DO REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS WILLING TO WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU I WON SEVENTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. WHY. ONE SEVEN NINE. HELLO. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. GIVEN THE NUMBER FOR Q. AND I'M CALLING BECAUSE- AGAIN WE'RE IN OPPOSITION OF PANTS AND THAT THIS IS NOT TO RUN BILL- NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU I WON FIFTY ONE PUPIL ADDS. THE MIXTURE TO MADDEN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE I WAS ACTUALLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE SUPPORT GROUPS THAT ARE ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT I APOLOGIZE FOR JUMPING AND LATE I THANK YOU- ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE FIFTY EIGHT. THANK YOU I'M TO FORTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU KRISTIN YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO IT THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS WHILE COMMENTS. I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU MOVES NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CENTER ADMIN. THANK YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATE LONG FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. SOME OF THE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY STOOD OUT FOR ME FROM THE OPPOSITION IS THE FEAR THAT. THE PATIENTS WILL SUFFER FROM THIS AND THEN THE OTHER THING I HEARD VERY CLEARLY WAS PEOPLE APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS DO YOU SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT. PATIENTS HAVING ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS AND ARE YOU COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION SO IT'S BECAUSE OF MY CONCERN WITH PATIENTS ACT HAVING ACCESS TO MEDICATION THAT I'M RUNNING THIS BILL- AND SO I CERTAINLY SHARE THAT CONCERN AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS IS EVIDENCED IN THE COMMENTS TODAY. BUT ALSO IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT I'M TAKING I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION. THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL AT THE PROPER TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR EDMUND IS STILL. A CENTER RUBIO. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND CLARITY BASED ON. BOTH SIDES OF THE TESTIMONY IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HOUSE- AND I LIKE THE BOTH SIDES ARE. REALLY FOCUSED ON PATIENT SAFETY AND ACCESS BUT- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF I MAY ASK. I THINK IT'S OPPOSITION I KNOW THAT THE WORSE OUR CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT. OB PATIENT SAFETY AND DIAL. AND THE DELIVERY AND QUALITY CONTROL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THEY CAN GO A LITTLE FURTHER AND- HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE MECHANISMS THAT WE USE. THANK YOU. MMHM THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO SPECIALLY PHARMACIES ARE NO DIFFERENT A PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN OF ANY OTHER AS COMPARED TO OTHER SUPPLY CHAIN- MEMBER IN THIS INSTANCE THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME DRUG- TRANSLATION HERE TO ACT UP PROVISIONS AND CONGRESS THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO COVER- TO MEET U. S. P. UNITED STATES PHARMACOPEIA STANDARDS FOR A QUALITY AND PROCESSING OF PRESCRIPTIONS- THEY ALSO HAVE MULTIPLE ACCREDITATIONS THAT THEY MUST MAINTAIN- SO THESE ARE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ACCORDED ACCREDITATION BODIES. THAT EVALUATE AND GRANT CERTIFICATION OR ACCREDITATION FOR THESE- SERVICES SO THE NOTION THAT THESE KINDS OF THESE THESE VENDORS ARE SOMEHOW LESS SAFE IS FRANKLY UNTRUE BECAUSE IN FACT DEPENDING ON THE DRUG OFTENTIMES THE PROVIDERS AND THE HOSPITALS WILL BE ACQUIRING THEIR DRUG SUPPLY FROM THE SAME VENDOR FROM SPECIALTY PHARMACY THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT FTA REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN DRUGS. AND ALSO THE MANUFACTURERS MAY IMPOSE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS SO THEY MAY CHOOSE TO LIMIT THEM TO CERTAIN SPECIALLY PHARMACIES BECAUSE IN FACT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE THAT THE SPECIALLY PHARMACY THAT IS PROVIDING THE-PRODUCT EXPENSING THE PRODUCT IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAINTAIN QUALITY STANDARDS AND DISTRIBUTION- I CAN ALSO SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE HAVING VISITED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- FACILITIES THAT- THESE ARE JUST THROWN IN AN ENVELOPE OF THESE TRUCKS ARE NOT THROWN IN AN ENVELOPE AND SHIPPED TO A LOCATION- THEY ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED PROCESSES INVOLVED ESPECIALLY FOR- SHIPMENTS THAT ARE SENT FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY LIKE I THINK ANOTHER WITNESS HAD MENTIONED THE YORK- WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SPECIALLY PHARMACIES WHEN THEY RECEIVE AN ORDER. WILL RUN A SERIES OF SOPHISTICATED ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE. THE PATH OF TRANSIT. LITERALLY THREE OBVIOUSLY ERROR OR GROUND THEY WILL PACK ENOUGH- INSULATION AND OR OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES IN A PACKAGE TO ENSURE NOT ONLY WILL THE PRODUCT BE SAFE SAFE AND STABLE BY THE TIME IT ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION. BUT THAT IT WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND SITTING OUT IN THE ELEMENTS FOR. UP TO A COUPLE OF DAYS IN SOME CASES SO AGAIN IT'LL DEPEND ON THE DRUG BUT UTMOST CARE IS TAKEN HERE AND- ANOTHER THING I'LL MENTION AS PURCHASED SAFETY. IT IS VERY MUCH AGAINST THE INTEREST OF ANYONE INVOLVED ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY PHARMACIES TO RISK SPOILAGE OR WASTE OF THESE PRODUCTS THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. AND IF THE DRUG IS SOMEHOW COMPROMISED BY THE TIME AND RIGHTS THE- THE CLINIC OR THE PROVIDER. THE LOSS OF THAT PRODUCT IS ON THE SPECIALLY PHARMACY SO IT'S NOT A VERY SUSTAINABLE MODEL. FOR THEM TO OPERATE IF THEY'RE LOSING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DRUGS. ON A FREQUENT BASIS IT JUST IS NOT HAPPENING SO. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE. THANK YOU- AND I JUST WANT TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE SPECIALTY- PHARMACIES GET THE DRUGS AND THEN FROM MY TO HEARD. TESTIMONY SOMEONE SAID IT. AND IT GOES TO THE PATIENT AND THEN THE PATIENT. BRINGS IT TO THE HOSPITAL SO. CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT THE PATIENT. IS EQUIPPED TO HANDLE IT AND GET THE MEDICATION WHEN THEY NEED TO GET IT TO THE HOSPITAL'S. OF COURSE THANK YOU CENTER OF YOUR QUESTION. SO THE- THE HEALTH PLAN. WORKING WITH THEIR- SOMETIMES AS WITH AN INTEGRATED AS A PBM OR INTEGRATED SPECIALLY PHARMACY. WAR WITH THE SEPARATELY CONTRACTED ENTITY THAT WILL DO THAT FOR THEM- THEY- ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DATA. FACTORS WHETHER OR NOT CERTAIN PATIENTS ARE. BETTER CANDIDATES FOR EASY REFERENCE BROWN BAGGING WHICH IS WHEN THE DRUG IS SENT TO THE PATIENT A PATIENT PRESIDENT. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO RISK THE SAFETY OF THE PATIENT OR THE DRUG. TO USE THAT METHOD. IF THEY'RE NOT A GOOD CANDIDATE FORCIBLE CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS TO. KNOW ARE THEY PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF HANDLING IT IS THE DRUG SOMETHING THAT COULD BE KEPT IN THE REFRIGERATOR. NOT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS SPECIAL COLD CHAIN HANDLING- OTHER FACTORS ARE THEY MENTALLY COGNIZANT DEPENDING ON THEIR CLAIMS HISTORY ARE THEY- YOU KNOW THE COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED OTHER OTHER CAT FACTORS. SO THIS ISN'T APPLY TO JUST ANY PATIENT OKAY. IT'S ONLY APPLIED IN THE CASE OF BROWN BAG ESPECIALLY TO THOSE PAGES THAT ARE BEST POSITIONED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE WRONG MEDICATION. AS FOR WHITE BACKING. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IF THERE'S COOPERATION WITH THE PRESCRIBER. WHO WILL BE ACEPTING THE SHIPMENT AND THEN DISPENSING IT THE PICTURE WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE DRUG CAME FROM. IT SHOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER COMES FROM THE POSITIONS STOCK OR IF IT COMES FROM SHIPMENT. THAT CAME IN EARLIER THAT DAY OR THE DAY BEFORE. SO YOU SHOULD BE COMPLETELY SEAMLESS. THANK YOU L. YOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR THE DISCUSSION TODAY I MEAN I GUESS IT'S IMPORTANT IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT ICAN SEE WHY THERE IS A PRACTICE OF THIRD PARTY VENDORS AND IT HAS TO DO WITH WITH COST SAVINGS IN AND FOR ME THE COST IS A REAL BIG BIG CONCERN BUT- I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS GEARED TOWARDS REDUCING THE COST OF MEDICATIONS FOR PATIENTS I THINK TO ME THAT'S FROM STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE- AGAIN THAT'S THE REASON THEY USE THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NOT BE. FOR HOSPITALS AND MAY NOT BE FISCALLY FEASIBLE SINCE THEY HAVE SUCH GREAT OVERHEAD AND QUALITY CONTROL I GUESS IMPLEMENTATION AND THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY OUT SO I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE BRINGING THE COST DOWN- EQUAL TO THAT OF SPECIALTY PHARMACIES BUT I DO WANT PATIENTS TO WIN AND I THINK ALL OF US ARE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT PATIENTS TO WIN. AND SO- I'M NOT NECESSARILY SURE RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT THAT EITHER SIDE IS SATISFACTORY TO ME- ON ONE HAND WE HAVE THE PATIENT SAFETY IN TERMS OF LIKE STORING AND HANDLING AND MAKING SURE THAT PATIENTS GET THE MEDICATION. RIPPLED WITH YOU KNOW TIMELY ACCESS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE THESE HIGH PRICES THAT MADE ME FAMILIES. AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND IT'S A REAL CONCERN YOU KNOW WHEN THE PRICES CAN BE. EXTREMELY HIGH. END SOUL YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT THE- SENATOR. HER TESTIMONY SAYING THAT SHE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WITH THE WITH THE OPPOSITION. I MEAN I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND SOMEWHERE I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MIDDLE GROUND IS. BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD THIS BILL. AGAIN BUT I REALLY WANTED TO BE FOCUS ON HOW DO WE- PROVIDE THAT ACCESS BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT THE PRICING IS RIGHT AND THAT THESE FAMILIES. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. ARE NOT LEFT HOLDING THE BAG SO TO SPEAK- AND THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY CAN GET THIS MEDICATION AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA BREAK THE BANK CELL. I ALSO WANT TO THINK OUT THERE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS WHICH IS IMPORTANT. BUT AGAIN I THINK THERE'S STILL MORE CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE COLLABORATION ON BOTH SIDES. BUT I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT BOTH SIDES EQUALLY ARE HEARING THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND I WANT THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I WILL MOVE THE BILL IF IT HASN'T BEEN MOVED. TO HAS IT IS IT HAS BEEN MOVED THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. MEMBERS CASEY NINE US ARMY FOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH- COMMITTEE STAFF- AND TAKING THE AMENDMENTS- WE DID TRY TO STRIKE A MIDDLE GROUND. MAYBE IT'S NOT THE FINAL MIDDLE GROUND- WHERE. WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT ON ONE HAND AS YOU PRESENTED IN YOUR OPENING- AND WE HEARD FROM THE WITH ME WITNESSES SUPPORT WE WANNA BE SURE THAT PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS AND TIMELY ARE YOU HAVE SOMEONE. COMING TO US TO IN FUSION CENTER OR SOME OTHER PLACE RIGHT TO GET TREATMENT. AND THE MEDICATION IS NOT THERE. RIGHT- IT'S UP. TO THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT THAT SAYS THAT THE COST TO THE PATIENT THAT'S A COSTLY FOR MEMBERS FOR ME THAT THAT. THE COST OF THE PATIENT NOT JUST FINANCIAL BUT THEIR HEALTH RIGHT. AND SO THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEMS TRYING TO DRESS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. SAMETIME WE WANTED AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH- THE STAFF- WE WANTED. NOT OVERLY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF. THE PLAN AGAIN TO ADDRESS THE FINANCIAL COSTS TO. IF THEY CAN PUT. THE ACCOUNT OF THE PROVIDE THE MEDICATION IN. THE PREPARATORY MATTER TO SAFE MANNER THAT HE COULD AT. THAT THAT THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE SO THAT- SO THAT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE. THEY COULD USE ANOTHER PHARMACY AND SO WE TRY TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH- THE COMMITTEE. STAFF ON THIS AND I AM SURE YOU HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH US. THAT THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS. BUT AGAIN OF COURSE THE SUPPORTING THE BILL- AND- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU DOCTOR PEN I THINK YOU SAID THIS AT YOU KNOW YOU SUMMARIZED IN. WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FINANCIAL COST VERSUS THE COST. OF HEALTH. AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION FOR THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE STATE FOR A VERY LONG TIME- BUT YOU KNOW AT THE CORE OF THIS IS. IF SOMEONE IS REALLY SICK IF YOU HAD A TERRIBLE WEEK WITH LEUKEMIA. AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR WEIGHT HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST WEEK. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE MEDICATION THAT YOU'RE GETTING FROM A THIRD PARTY VENDOR. MAY NO LONGER BE APPLICABLES AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THAT MEDICINE. AT THE HOSPITAL SO WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSION OF WHERE TO GET THE MEDICINE THAT. SAVES YOUR LIFE DO YOU GET IT FROM THE HOSPITAL HA. PHARMACY OR DO YOU GET IT FROM A THIRD PARTY BY. IF YOU GET IT FROM THE THIRD PARTY MEN. IT MAY BE. BUT YOU WILL NOT ALWAYS GET IT AT THE TIME YOU NEED IT. AND THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT- CERTAINLY WE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE LOST. ON THAT AT THE END THIS BILL IS ABOUT PRIORITIZING THE HEALTH. OF THAT INDIVIDUAL AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT IF AT THIS WAS NOT AN ISSUE YOU WOULDN'T SEE SEVENTEEN STATES IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY'RE LOOKING AT GUARDRAILS ARE CURRENTLY HAVE GUARD RAILS. AND YOU WOULDN'T SEE DOZENS OF HOSPITALS AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ST WE NEED TO HAVE A CHANGE IN PRACTICE. IF THIS IS A MEDICINE THAT'S GOING TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL. HELP EXTEND THE LIFE ESPECIALLY INTEREST YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TO PASS AS AMENDED REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND POLICE WAS AT CENTER EGGMANTO. REMOVE THE BILL- CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HI CAN HI MELINDA'S. EGGMAN EGGMAN AYE GONZALEZ GROVE. FURTADO LEYVA I LEYVA AYE LEÃ“N HI LIMON AYE ROTH. ROTH AYE RUBIO. AYE RUBIO AYE WIENER AYE WIENER AYE.

WITH GREAT THANK YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING INTENSIVELY- WITH US ON THIS BILL- AND FOR COMING UP WITH SOME HAVING SOME STRONG AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS- IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS- COLLEAGUES ON THE SENATE BILL NINE TWENTY THREE- IS IMPORTANT- AND VERY TIMELY MEASURE- TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM- FOR- TRANSGENDER GENDER NON CONFORMING AND INTERSEX PATIENTS. TO ENSURE THE DAY- RECEIVED- APPROPRIATE- AND SUPPORTIVE SO I CARE AND THAT THEY ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST OR STIGMATIZED- IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ARE CURRENTLY THERE IS NO NATIONAL GUIDANCE ON TRANS INCLUSIVE CARE- AND SENATE BILL NINE TWENTY THREE WOULD SERVE AS A FIRST IN THE NATION MODEL- FOR TO ENSURE THE TGI PATIENTS OF QUALITY AND COMPASSIONATE HEALTH CARE FROM PROVIDERS ON THE AMENDMENTS- THAT WILL BE ACCEPTING FROM THE COMMITTEE WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT I DO WANT TO. STATE THEM PUBLICLY ON THE BILL RIGHT NOW MANDATES- TRAINING- INSTEAD OF THAT WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO CMA- INTO CONTINUING- EDUCATION AND WE'VE- THROUGHOUT- CME- IT WILL REQUIRE AN AMENDMENT WILL REQUIRE THAT- DEPARTMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED CARE- DODD TRACK AND MONITOR COMPLAINTS AND PUBLICLY REPORT FINDINGS- WITH OTHER DATA IN THEIR ANNUAL REPORT WEBSITE OR OTHER PUBLIC REPORTS- IT ONE EIGHT INS IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE- EXECUTIVES AND THE BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE GO TO THEIR HEALTH PLAN NETWORK DIRECTORY THEY KNOW. WHO PROVIDES GENDER AFFIRMING CARE- WE'RE GOING TO- NOT FOR THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT- IT'LL BE- ACCESSIBLE LINK FROM THE PLAN'S PROVIDER DIRECTORY- ANNEXED. ACCEPTABLE TO THE INSURANCE CALL CENTER- TIME A LIST OF IN FOR.% WHO PROVIDE JONES OR FOR CARE- IN ADDITION- THE- ALTIUM IN SERVICES- IS AND SEE WHAT CONVENE A WORKING GROUP INCLUDING TJ I PEOPLE- TO DEVELOP A- QUALITY STANDARDS. FOR PATIENT EXPERIENCE FOR TGI PATIENT EXPERIENCE- TO MAKE SURE THAT- PROVIDERS ARE PROVIDING APPROPRIATE CARE TGI PEOPLE. AND ALSO TO CREATE A CORPORATE TRAINING STANDARDS SO THIS WORKING GROUP. WILL MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AND THEN THESE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED- AND AGAIN CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE FIRST. STATE IN THE COUNTRY- TO DO SO- BECAUSE BIG PICTURE- HERE- pTERRIFYING. WHAT STATES LIKE TEXAS AND IDAHO- AND OTHER STATES ARE DOING RIGHT NOW- TO TRANS YOUTH AND THE TRANS PEOPLE IN GENERAL- WE HAVE STATES IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AND SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE. BETTER LITERALLY CLASSIFYING GENDER AFFIRMING CARE AS CHILD ABUSE- AND THREATENING TO TAKE TRANSYLVANIA WAY FROM THEIR PARENTS- AND PUT HIM IN FOSTER CARE AND THEN PUT THE PARENTS. IN IN PRISON- SIMPLY BECAUSE PARENTS ARE SUPPORTING THEIR TRANS GENDER- OUR CHILDREN. ARE WE HAVE STATES THAT ARE BANNING SIMPLY BANNING- HEALTHCARE FOR TRANS- CHILDREN MAKING IT ILLEGAL. CRIMINALIZING POSITIONS HAVE- STATES THAT ARE PROHIBITING- TRANSPORT FROM USING THE RESTROOM THAT CORRESPONDS TO THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OR BANNING TRANS YOUTH FROM PLAYING SPORTS AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON- THE MESSAGE THAT THAT SENDS TRANS PEOPLE PARTICULARLY TO TRANS YOUTH IS HORRIFIC- AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT. RATES OF SELF HARM OR HIGHER AMONG TRANS KIDS THERE'S NOTHING INHERENT ERRORS BECAUSE OF THE SOCIETY THE MESSAGE THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING FROM SOCIETY- THIS BILL WILL SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE CONTRARY- CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF IN SUPPORTING OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY- AND THIS BILL WILL KEEP US IN THAT. DIRECTION THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR TRANSGENDER EQUALITY REPORTS THAT ONE THIRD OF ALL TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS WHO SAW HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL IN A GIVEN YEAR HAD AT LEAST ONE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE RELATING TO THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. WITH EVEN HIGHER RATES FOR TRANS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND TRANS DISABLED PEOPLE INCLUDE AT TIMES BEING REFUSED TREATMENT ENTIRELY BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER IDENTITY BEING VERBALLY HARASSED- EVEN ASSAULTED- ARE HAVING TO TEACH IN THE PROVIDER ABOUT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE APPROPRIATE CARE. SOMETIMES IN THESE SITUATIONS ARE OR ABUSIVE AND INTENTIONAL IN OTHER SITUATIONS ARE PROVIDERS WHO MEAN NO HARM OR NOT. I HAVE NO ILL WILL BUT SIMPLY DON'T KNOW. DON'T KNOW HOW TO INTERACT APPROPRIATELY IN SUPPORT OF MATTER WITH TGI PATIENTS A TRACK. AT TRANSPERSONAL SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TEACH THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER HOW TO DO THAT. ON 23% OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE REPORTED THAT FEAR OF DISCRIMINATION CAUSED THEM TO POSTPONE OR NOT RECEIVE NECESSARY MEDICAL CARE BUT IT JUST WASN'T WORTH. THE TENSION OR THE AWKWARDNESS- OR OR OR OR JUST IT WASN'T WORTH GOING THROUGH THAT- AND NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO GO TO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE ONLY TO BE MISGENDERED HARASSED OR EVEN REFUSE TREATMENT- AND SAYS I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT ABOUT DEMONIZING PROVIDERS SO MANY PROVIDERS WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE PROVIDING SUPPORT IN TERMS OF TRAINING AND LEARNING AND KNOWING WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE- SO THAT THEY CAN DO WHAT SO MANY WANT TO DO WHICH IS TO TREAT PEOPLE. ACTIVELY AND WITH COMPASSION- BY ENSURING. THAT WE PERFORMANCE SPACE STANDARD. ALTERNATELY TRAINING- WE WILL HAVE A BETTER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FRANKLY NOT JUST FOR TGI PEOPLE BUT FOR EVERYONE- SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. STEP FORWARD IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BY TGI- INDIVIDUALS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY- MISTER CHAIRMAN ARE- REVEREND BENITA RAMSEY- AND ERIN POLLARD.

A SO WE WILL BE EVALUATING THE MOMENTS AND CIRCLING BACK WITH OUR MEMBERS AND- LOOKING AT THAT TIME TO RE EVALUATE YOUR POSITION BUT- WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US AND HOPE TO- KEEP. AN OPEN DIALOGUE THAT MOVING FORWARD I SHOULD IF THERE IS NEED TO. IRIS I FIGURE THINGS OUT. THANKS VERY THANKS FOR HAVING ME I'M CAT AND IDENTIFIED AS A TRANSGENDER MALE STARTING AT AGE THIRTEEN A MEDICALLY TRANSITION LATER AS AN ADULT AFTER YEARS OF STRUGGLING WITH GENDERDYSPHORIA ALONG WITH DIAGNOSED ANOREXIA BULIMIA ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION I THOUGHT THE PURSUING MEDICAL TRANSITION AND LIVING AS THE OPPOSITE SEX WOULD BRING ME HAPPINESS. I BELIEVE WE'RE TRANS ACTIVIST TOLD ME BUT TRANSITIONING WAS MY BEST OPTION IN THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT SUICIDE. I RECEIVED A PRESCRIPTION FOR TESTOSTERONE FROM THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD HERE IN SACRAMENTO AFTER ONLY A THIRTY MINUTE PHONE CALL WITH THE DOCTOR. NO BLOOD WORK NORTH THIRTY WAS REQUIRED. MY OTHER SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES AS WELL AS MY HESITATION DUE TO BEING UNSURE OF THE AFFECTS TESTOSTERONE WOULD HAVE ON MY SINGING VOICE. WERE OF NO CONCERN TO THE DOCTOR. I WAS A SEMI PROFESSIONAL SINGER AT THIS TIME. HER MOANS ABOUT NOT THERAPY WERE COVERED BY MY HEALTH INSURANCE. A SECOND PLANNED PARENTHOOD DOCTOR WROTE ME AN APPROVAL LETTER FOR A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY ALSO WITHOUT ANY IN PERSON MEETING OR RECOMMENDATION THAT I ADDRESS MY OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FIRST. AFTER FOUR MONTHS OF INJECTING TESTOSTERONE I SUFFERED HEATH SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDING HEART PALPITATIONS. STABBING PAIN IN MY RIGHT SIDE. NAUSEA VOMITING AND OEDEMA. I CORD OF LOCAL DISABILITY THAT MADE IT PAINFUL TO SPEAK OR SING. I WAS FORCED TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO STOP TRANSITIONING. ALTHOUGH MY HEALTH SYMPTOMS HAVE IMPROVED I STILL HAVE TROUBLE PROJECTING MY VOICE. AND CAN NO LONGER SING LIVE. I'M ONE OF A QUICKLY GROWING NUMBER OF THE TRANSITION EARNERS INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM TRANSITION NOT ONLY FAILED TO IMPROVE. BUT WORSEN THEIR SITUATION GENDER DYSPHORIA IS A SYMPTOM AND OFTEN TEMPORARY IN CONTRAST TRANSGENDER BODY MODIFICATION IS PERMANENT. KNOWN TO CAUSE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS AND THERE'S CURRENTLY NO PROOF IT IMPROVES MENTAL HEALTH IN THE LONG TERM. AFTER SPENDING OVER A YEAR HEALING FOR MY TRANSITION EXPERIENCE I HAVE COME TO ACCEPT MY BIOLOGICAL SEX. I AM A WOMAN AN ADULT HUMAN FEMALE AND THIS CAN NEVER BE CHANGED. OTHERS OTHER DE TRANSITION OURS WENT MUCH FURTHER IN THEIR TRANSITION I NOW REGRET HAVING BODY PARTS REMOVED OR FEEL DEVASTATED THERE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN. SENATE BILL NINE TWENTY THREE WOULD DENY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOMMEND TREATMENTS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PATIENT'S. GENDER AFFIRMING CARE HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO ALLEVIATE GENDER DYSPHORIA. CONSIDER HOW THIS LEGISLATION WILL PREVENT VULNERABLE GROUPS SUCH AS YOUNG PEOPLE AND THOSE WITH COMORBID MENTAL ILLNESSES.

SAN ANDREAS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I WANTED TO ASK CAPT IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND COMING UP TO THE MICROPHONE I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU THANK YOU. SO DON'T BE NERVOUS- I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY FEELS STRANGE STANDING BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS- I JUST WANTED TO HEAR A LITTLE MORE ABOUT. THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAD- YOU ONLY HAD YOU KNOW TWO MINUTES BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE. DECIDES THEY WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS TRANSITION AND IN YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU AID YOU STARTED OFF- THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD GAVE YOU. TESTOSTERONE WITHOUT WELL I WILL PUT WORDS IN MATH PLEASE IF YOU IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND TAKE YOUR TIME. YEAH SO I STARTED IDENTIFYING AS TRANS AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN AND- DUE TO WANTING 2% TO PURSUE SINGING AS MY CAREER- AND YOU KNOW JUST VARIOUS OTHER REASONS I DID NOT TRANSITION UNTIL I WAS AN ADULT BUT- AT THAT TIME I WAS NOT IN ANY THERAPY- I CALLED PLANNED PARENTHOOD MAINLY WITH THE AIM OF JUST- EXPLORING MY GENDER DYSPHORIA- I ASSUME THERE WOULD BE. SOME TYPE OF REQUIREMENTS LIKE A LETTER FROM A DOCTOR OR THERAPIST WHATEVER- BUT INSTEAD I WAS JUST IMMEDIATELY AFFIRMS AT- AS A TRANSGENDER MAN AND- I JUST TALK TO THE DOCTOR THERE FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AND I GOT MY PRESCRIPTION AND THEN BASICALLY THE SAME THING WHICH WAS TRUE FOR. MY TOP SURGERY LETTER WHICH I GOT APPROVAL FOR ABOUT A MONTH LATER ALSO FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD OVER THE PHONE. OKAY SORRY OKAY SO YOU SAID THERE WERE NO- I GUESS- PSYCHIATRIC- APPOINTMENTS THAT YOU WERE REQUIRED TO HAVE THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW- ADDRESS. HERE THE MINDSET AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH WITH THE DECISION THAT'S THAT'S THIS MONUMENTAL NO THERE ARE NO- THERE ARE NO APPOINTMENTS WITH THE PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST- REQUIRED AND I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THIS IS THE INFORMED CONSENT MODEL WHICH IS IT THIS IS WHAT TRANS ACTIVISTS ARE PUSHING FOR THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT EVERYWHERE- THEY WANT YOU TO JUST BE ABLE TO. GET IT ON YOUR AND GET GET THE HORMONES AND SURGERY- ON YOUR FIRST APPOINTMENTS. OKAY I SEE IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANTED TO SHARE WITH US TODAY THAT YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO SHARE IN YOUR FIRST- GO AT THE MICROPHONE NOW IS YOUR CHANCE. A WELL HOURS THANK YOU I WILL SHARE THAT ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS AS A D. TRANSITION OR IS IT- THERE IS ACTUALLY A LOT OF SUPPORT SET UP ALREADY FOR TRANSITIONING. ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT FOR DE TRANSITIONING- YOU KNOW MYSELF I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY CORRECTIVE SURGERY BUT MANY DO TRANSITION OR IS TO REQUIRE THAT AND- IT IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE LIKE TRANS SERVICES ARE- AND THERE'S A LACK OF SOCIAL SUPPORT. BY TRANSACTION THIS TEND TO IGNORE THE TRANSITION EARNERS- SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION TO BE AN AND ALSO THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN MY SITUATION IS RISING AND THIS THIS PUSH FOR AFFIRMATIVE CARE. AND INFORMED CONSENT MODEL IS ONLY GOING TO CREATE. MORE SITUATIONS LIKE MINE BECAUSE IT IT'S ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENTS- AND ALSO JUST I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE MORE THING AND THAT IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO LITERALLY CHANGE SEX AND- YOU KNOW THESE PROCEDURES THAT ARE. ARE BEING PRESCRIBED SO EASILY- THEY THEY DO THEY'RE DOCUMENTED TO LEAD TO HEALTH PROBLEMS. HI HIRE- INCREASED RISK OF HEART ATTACK STROKE CANCER- YOU KNOW THESE ARE KNOWN RISKS AND- SERVE YOU. CHANGE TAX AND BY TELLING THEM THAT THAT THEY CAN AND LEADING THEM DOWN THIS PATH- IT IS HARMING A LOT OF PEOPLE AND SO. I JUST WANT TO BRING SOME ATTENTION TO THAT SIDE OF THE ISSUE. OKAY THANK YOU CAN I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS I KNOW IT'S HARD TO. SHARE SOMETHING SO PERSONAL BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME- SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- SENATOR WIENER. SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHO WOULD PROVIDE THE EVIDENCE BASED CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING. TO HEALTH CARE STAFF IN THE THEIR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS. TO THE CENTER THANK YOU FOR THAT- QUESTION OF COURSE THE BILL IS BEING AMENDED SO IT'S NO LONGER GOING TO BE A STANDALONE- MANDATED. MULTI HOUR TRAINING FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER INSTEAD IT'S GOING TO BE WOVEN INTO THE EXISTING. CONTINUING EDUCATION- AND THAT'LL BE DONE THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS IN TERMS OF HOW CONTINUING EDUCATION- IS CRAFTED ON WHO WOULD BE PROVIDING THAT TRAINING THERE COULD BE. A LOT COULD BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE OR ORGANIZATIONS- YOU YOU COULD DEFINITELY THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE TRAINING ON- ON AUG ON THESE ISSUES AND YOUR CONTRACT WITH THEM. I MEAN IT COULD BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT- I CAN SEE SPECIFICALLY WHO'S GONNA BUT SO OKAY SO WOULD IT BE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD THAT WOULD DETERMINE OR DECIDE WHO PROVIDES THIS TRAINING. IT IS- AND DOCTOR PAN PROBABLY AROUND TERMS OF HALCION ME IS CRAFTED ON PERHAPS OFFER PAN COULDN'T COMMENT ON THE OUTSIDE. L. AS A PHYSICIAN RUBIO COMMENTS. AS A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROCESS THAT THE ME IS ACTUALLY. USUALLY SPONSORED BY. MEDIC MEDIC ORGANS EXAMPLE ACOSTA OR HEALTH- AND ACADEMICAL SENT. MEDICAL WITH- BASICALLY- WOULD SPONSOR CNN THEY WOULD SEEK OUT EXPERTS- IN THE FIELD- TO PROVIDE- THAT CONTENT AND TO TEACH THAT CONTENT AND OFTENTIMES THERE'S- THAT'S THE VERY VIGOROUS- REVIEW. OF THE SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY AND ALSO BY THE WAY- ALSO A CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS THAT ALSO REQUIRED IN FOR CME. NOW THIS IS I THINK- YEP THERE'S ALSO OTHER AND COURSE FOR THOSE OF US ON TV WE IF KNOWN I'VE ALWAYS BRING UP QUESTIONS ABOUT US CONTINUING EDUCATION- OF AGAIN- SOMETIMES SOMEBODY'S CONTINUE EDUCATION. COURSES ARE ALSO A DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR PROFESSION HEALTH PROFESSION AND MAY ALSO BE REVIEWED BY THE- OF. THE LICENSING BOARD AS WELL FOR APPROVAL. OKAY SIR THEN. THAT ARE DEVELOP. MEDICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES RELATED TO HEALTH CARE FOR TRANSGENDER PATIENTS DOES YOUR BILL REQUIRE THESE COMPETENCY TRAINERS TO BE MEDICALLY TRAINED. THE BILL REQUIRES CMA AS AMENDED THAT SEMI TAKEN TO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF TRANS GENDER NON CONFORMING AND INTERSEX PATIENTS THAT'S WHAT IT REQUIRES CELLS OR WHATEVER THE CME PROCESS IS- DOCTOR PENSIONS RIDICULOUS HAVING GONE THROUGH IT HIMSELF FOR MANY YEARS- THAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS HERE AGAIN. TO MAKE SURE THAT IN VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF HEALTH PRACTICE- THAT TRANSGENDER ARE CONFORMING INTERSEX PEOPLE- ARE BEING TREATED BY PROVIDERS WHO ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS WHO THEY ARE- AND THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. OKAY SO- THE BILL DOESN'T SPECIFY- WHO WOULD DO THE TRAINING WHO WOULD BE QUALIFIED TO DO THE TRAINING YOUR IT'S ESSENTIALLY WITH THE AMENDMENTS LEAVING IT UP TO. THE MEDICAL BOARD ESSENTIALLY THAT THE CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION. CHOI THERE'S BEEN CONTINUING MENTAL AS MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY YEARS ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS NO I UNDERSTAND I JUST RETURNING TO. WHERE THE RESPONSIBILITY LIES AND I AM NOT A POSITION BUT I IMAGINE SOME OF THOSE TRAININGS ARE BY. OTHER PHYSICIANS SOME OF THOSE TRAININGS MAY NOT BE BY PHYSICIANS BECAUSE OF PHYSICIANS AREN'T ALL IT YOU KNOW YOU COULD AS A LAWYER. WHEN I DID CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION SOMETIMES THERE WERE SUBJECTS THAT YOU THAT YOU DON'T NEED A LAWYER WASN'T RELEVANT THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IF SOMEONE'S COMING TO TRAIN YOU FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT YOU KNOW SAY SEXUAL HARASSMENT ISN'T THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. A LAWYER AND THE SAME IS TRUE IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AS A WHOLE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS AND IF A- YOU KNOW WITH SOMEONE WHO IS A- SAID TRANS PERSON. IS GOING TO TALK TO PHYSICIANS ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF TRANS PATIENTS AND HOW TO BE SENSITIVE AND SUPPORTIVE BUT DOESN'T NEED TO BE A PHYSICIAN FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY SAMPLE OF ONE COMPONENT. OF TRAINING. A SUMMONS AND THIS IS. THAT FOR. POSITIONS MIGHT WANT HEAR FROM THE- FROM PERSON ON THE PHONE. WITH A TERRIBLE X. RIGHT THAT HEARING ABOUT EXPERIENCES CAN BE HELPFUL IN SAYING SO THAT PHYSICIANS ARE MINDFUL. WHEN THEY TREAT TGI PATIENTS BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS YEAH I AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPRESSION I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS- IT YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE DOING THIS TRAINING WHERE- HERE IS THERE A NATIONAL. IS- CERTIFICATION PROCESSES ARE SOME ACCREDITATION PROCESS UNSETTLED GROUP SOME PEOPLE CAN YES TWO I AND I CENTER BECAUSE- LAUGHING BUT NO NO I IT'S BECAUSE SOCIETY HAS TRIED TO RACE. TGI PEOPLE FOREVER AND IN FACT IN THE TESTIMONY TODAY WE HEARD A THEME ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE NOT REALLY EXISTING AND WE LOOK AROUND THE COUNTRY RONALD THE RESTROOM STUFF IN THE SPORTS ETCETERA ETCETERA THE THEME IS THAT TRANS PEOPLE ARE ALSO SPEAKING AT AND THEY DON'T REALLY EXIST AND ARE TRYING TO PULL SOME SORT OF SCAM THAT'S- THE TEAM. THAT THAT THAT THAT HAS BEEN REFERRED TO TODAY AND WE HEAR IT AROUND THE COUNTRY SO BECAUSE OF THAT THERE THERE'S NO ACCREDITATION BODY FOR AS I SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO DO THIS. I'M PART OF THE REASON THAT THIS BILL- IT'S BEEN AMENDED PER WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE IS TO CREATE UNDER DMACC EXHIBIT WITH A RESEARCH US. A WORKING GROUP THAT WOULD NOT WOULD INCLUDE TGI PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO TGI PEOPLE WOULD INCLUDE ON EXPERTS IN AND PRACTICE AND- IN EDUCATION I TO COME UP WITH BOTH THE CURRICULUM- AS WELL AS- STANDARDS PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS- SO THAT THAT WERE THE FIRST IN THE NATION- TO DO THAT AND I'M PROUD THAT WE ARE. WELL OKAY SO I GUESS YOU KNOW FROM WHERE I SIT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A BIT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY IDENTIFIED WHO IS QUALIFIED TO DO THIS TYPE OF TRAINING OR WHO- WILL DO IT BUT THE BILL DOES. MAKE IT- A- TO NOT PROVIDE THIS I DON'T THINK IT'S A CRIME IT WOULD BE REFERRED TO PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE OF OR I DON'T WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WERE VOTING ON WHAT'S BEFORE SAYING I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE ANALYSIS SOMEONE AND THINGS IT'S IN THE ANALYSIS IS ON THE FACT THAT YOU YOU KNOW FM A PROVIDER COULD GET INTO SOME TROUBLE AND E FINE A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IF THEY DON'T PROVIDE- THIS TRAINING SO- WELL IF SOMETHING IS. WELL FIRST OF ALL AGAIN. WHAT OKAY AMENDED. BUT YES- WHAT WE DO MANDATE THINGS LIKE TRAINING YOU HAVE TO. DO IT AND THAT'S THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF A RIGHT BUT WE DON'T ENDORSE WE DON'T YET KNOW WHO'S QUALIFIED TO EVEN DO THIS TRAINING SO- MY FINAL. QUESTION WOULD BE- WHAT IF THE. MEDICAL PROVIDER HAS A DIFFERENT EVIDENCE BASED. OPINION DAN THE COMPETENCY TRAINERS LIKE WHAT IF WHAT IF THEY'RE NOT MATCHING UP WHAT I MEAN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE MEDICAL PROVIDER HAS TO DEFER TO THE OPINION OF THE COMPETENCY TRAINER EVEN THOUGH ONE HAS GONE TO MEDICAL SCHOOL THE OTHER LIKELY HAS NOT. SO ARE YOU REFERRING TO RELIGIOUS OBJECTIONS TO TREAT NO PEOPLE NO BY THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE- REFERRING TO BECAUSE WE HEAR THAT A LOT ABOUT- BY. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS DON'T WANT TO TREAT LGBTQ PEOPLE. AND SURVEYS THEREFORE THE PLAN- NO I'M NOT AN EXEMPTION WHICH I DON'T AGREE WITH. NO I'M STE- NO I DIDN'T MEAN SOMEBODY WHO- I MEAN YOU KNOW A PHYSICIAN WHO MEETS WITH THE PATIENT AND HAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT- ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSITIONING OR EVEN JUST IN THE INITIAL STAGES LIKE. THE WITNESS WHO TESTIFIED TODAY- THAT YOU KNOW THE PHYSICIAN MAY. LISTENED EVERYTHING AND THINK YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS PERSON IS- IS READY- TO MOVE PERHAPS TO THE NEXT STEP. SOME MORE- YOU KNOW DISCUSSION PERHAPS NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AND SO WHAT IF THE COMPETENCY TRAINER SAYS NO THANK THAT'S THAT'S NOT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS TO BE DONE I DON'T THINK SO THE COMPANY TRADE THIS COMPETENCY IF THERE. WAS ONE THERE ARE TRAININGS AND STANDARD WHEN THEIR MINDS ARE FORMULATED IT'S NOT ABOUT LIKE THIS IS HOW YOU PRACTICE MEDICINE IN TERMS OF LIKE YOU THIS IS WHEN YOU DO A PROCEDURE OR HOW YOU DO A PROCEDURE PHYSICIANS GET TRAINED AND PROVIDING GENDER AFFIRMING CARE AND NOT EVERY POSITION. IS TRAINED TO DO THAT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THE OTHER PART OF THIS BILL IS REQUIRING THAT HEALTH PLANS IN THEIR NETWORK DIRECTORIES IDENTIFY WHO WERE THE PHYSICIANS THAT PROVIDE GENDER AFFIRMING CARE TO TRANS PEOPLE- DON'T HAVE TO GAS AND DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A THOUSAND PHONE CALLS THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE HERE THE PEOPLE WHO AGREE TO THAT WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED- TO DO THAT. SO THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHEN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES- BUT THEY'RE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT UNDERSTANDS A TRANS PEOPLE EXIST A THIRD TITLE TO RESPECT THIS IS HOW YOU INTERACT. WITH THEM- AND SO FORTH- OKAY WELL- I THINK THAT'S- I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW THANK YOU RICHARD. SIR EDMUND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I KNOW LAST TIME I HAD TO DO MY CME FOR MY LICENSE- BY CONTINUING EDUCATIONS DISCOURTESY USE- WAS ON A BILL THAT WE DID HERE IN THIS IN THIS BODY HE WAS ON A SUICIDE AND SO- HI THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE DO RIGHT WE PASS BILLS ABOUT WHAT WE THINK PROFESSIONALS CAN KNOW ABOUT OF THE WE SHOULD THINK THEY SHOULD KNOW MORE. AND THEN WE TRUST- THEIR PROFESSIONAL BODIES TO DEVELOP THOSE AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA YOU ALSO BRING TOGETHER A GROUP TO LOOK AT IT SO CENTER WINNER MIGHT MY UNDERSTANDING RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING TO SPEAK TO A LITTLE. SOME OF THE WHAT WE HEARD. IS IN ORDER FOR SOMEONE TO RECEIVE MEDICATION OR TO BEGIN ANY KIND OF TRANSITIONING PROCESS THEY HAVE TO FIRST HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF GENDER DYSPHORIA. DOT AND AS AN ASSISTANT YOU DON'T YOU DON'T MAKE A DIAGNOSIS LIKE THAT WITHOUT A FEW VISITS FOR SOMEONE SO. TO SOMEONE WHO WENT TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND RECEIVE MEDICATIONS ALREADY HAD TO HAVE AN EVALUATION TO BE GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS OF GENDER DYSPHORIA. AS YOU UNDERSTAND IT. THIRD THIRD ROUND NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL AND I KNOW BUT I PREFER SITE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY. WILL BE HEARD A LOT TODAY- I KNOW. FIVE I KNOW AND REPRESENT A HUGE NUMBER OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE- I KNOW AN ENORMOUS NUMBER TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. WHO ARE. EXTREMELY HAPPY. THAT THEY HAVE NOW HAVE THE CORRECT GENDER GENDER IDENTITY BACK FORMS TO WHO THEY ARE- AND- THEY AND SO THIS WHOLE NOTION THAT. TRANSIT FATE CAN EVERYONE'S UNHAPPY IT IS DOES NOT IS NOT TRUE- DAY I ALSO IN SAN FRANCISCO WE'RE BLESSED TO HAVE MEDICAL PROVIDERS. WHO PROVIDE EXCELLENT CARE- AND LIKE THAT CARE IS WHAT IT IS AND YES THERE ARE I YOU KNOW I'M I'M- NOT WITH PEOPLE YOU. ABOUT THIS AND THERE ARE YES THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF PROTOCOLS AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF EVALUATIONS THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE- WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERING- TRANSITIONING. OF COURSE THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES NOT DEFINE. WHAT MEDICAL CARE IS DOES NOT- IT THIS BILL IS ABOUT ABOUT PROTOCOLS AND TRAINING AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY. THANK YOU AND I WOULD JUST TRY TO GET TO SEE SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD THAT MAY ALARM PEOPLE IS THAT PEOPLE JUST. CALLING ON THE PHONE AND GET PRESCRIPTIONS. SO DID SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE HERE'S WHAT I KNOW AS A LICENSED PERSON WHO'S TRAINED OTHER LICENSE PEOPLE. IN ORDER TO GET. THE DIAGNOSIS OF GENDER DYSPHORIA YOU HAVE TO HAVE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE MEETINGS FOR THE MOST PART- BEFORE THE DIAGNOSIS IS GIVEN AND THEN. IN ORDER FOR THE TRANSITION TO OCCUR. THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT IT'S BASED ON- SO- IN AND I AGREE WE HEARD WE HEARD TALKING ABOUT ABOUT PEOPLE DENYING PEOPLE'S EXISTENCE SAYING IT'S NOT REAL THING IT'S FAKE- AND I AND I GET THERE COULD BE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION BUT I THINK OUR JOB AS LEGISLATORS IS TO MAKE SURE OUR SYSTEMS ARE JUST- AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WE'RE TRYING TO DO- SO. THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MANDATING ANYTHING BUT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT- WHO THEY SEE ANNA AND I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. ACTUALLY SUPPORT YOUR BILL. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE CONVERSATION THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT SHOULDN'T BE SHOCKING TO A PHYSICIAN WHO WALKS IN. AND SEES SOMETHING HE MAY NOT. HE OR SHE MAY NOT EXPECT THAT IF WE HAVE CONTINUING EDUCATION SOMEBODY WOULD KNOW A BETTER WAY AND EVEN IF YOU YOU KNOW IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO NOT TREAT SOMEBODY. BUT AT LEAST TO BE ABLE TO BACK OUT OF A ROOM IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY. THEN HUMILIATING SOMEONE AND CAN CAUSING FURTHER HARM- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I KNOW THESE ARE YOU KNOW THAT IT IS A- IS A DIFFICULT PLACE TO SIT- WHEN PEOPLE. WANT TO DENY OTHER PEOPLE'S VERY EXISTENCE TONIGHT BY SHARED RECENTLY I BY BLUSTER FAMILY MEMBER. AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THE YOUNG PERSON WHO WANT TO TRANSITION. ERRANT'S AGAIN HEARING A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY. AND ANNA. OF THAT AND THEN. HEARING A LOT. OF ARE AFRAID FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND SAID NOW. THEN THAT PERSON THEN DECIDED TO PURSUE IT ON THEIR OWN AFTER THEY- WHEN THEY TURNED EIGHTEEN AND THE PARENTS AND LEAVE AND THEY DID. AND ENDED UP. OVERDOSING TWO DAYS LATER. SO IT IS A IT IS NOT SOMETHING FAKE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING MADE UP TO SEE WHO PEOPLE ARE. AND WE NEED TO FIND. EVERY WAY THAT WE CAN TO MAKE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. B. AS- INFORMED. TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE. AS HE CAN. SO WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIMES I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. POSTED BY SIR EDMUND TELEPHONE. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW AS IT IS A LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION AND ALL THE SIDES- PRESENT A THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT I'VE BROUGHT TO THIS COMMITTEE- THE BILLS THAT WOULD REQUIRE. ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND INCLUSION OF DIFFERENT TOPICS A LOT OF YOU KNOW I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME- AROUND THE ALZHEIMER'S SPACE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED TO- ABOUT BRINGING IN BEING A LEGISLATOR IN BRINGING BILLS FORWARD THAT WOULD INCLUDE THAT OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS. HAVE MORE TRAINING NOT LESS TRAINING IS THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY DICTATE. WHO DOES THE TRAINING BECAUSE THAT IS THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THAT DECIDES WHO IS THE RIGHT PERSON SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE X. PERSON OR THAT PERSON BE THE TRAINERS- BUT ALSO AS SOMEONE THAT'S WORKED WITH HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS- THROUGHOUT MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER UP THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS TO HAVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING REGARDLESS OF WHAT OUR CAREER IS- AND I THINK THAT. IT IT YOU KNOW INCLUDING A BROADER UNDERSTANDING I THINK IS THE RIGHT MEDICAL DIRECTION TO GO- NOT INCLUDING BLESS AND AS I READ YOUR BILL THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTOOD AT THE BILL TO BE DOING TO BE ASKING OUR MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO HAVE MORE UNDERSTANDING AND MORE AND ARE STANDING. IS BE INCLUSIVE TO OF EXPERIENCES A VARIETY OF INFORMATION IT ALSO NGUYEN SHORES- AND I THINK THAT SENATOR EGGMAN ALLUDED TO THIS WE HAVE TO DO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO GET TRAINING CONTINUOUSLY. AND THE REASON WE DO THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WE CAN LEARN AND IF WE ONLY DO IT YOU KNOW ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND NOT DO IT ONGOING- WE LIMIT HOW. WE CAN BE A TO EITHER FOR IN MY CASE IT WAS THE STUDENT BUT IN THE CASE OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IT'S TO THE PATIENT RIGHT. AND SO I'M GRATEFUL THAT THIS BILL HAS COME FORWARD- I UNDERSTAND AND I BELIEVE THAT MORE TRAINING AT IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GO TO BE INCLUSIVE OF THE MUCH INFORMATION THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD. TO BE A BETTER PROVIDER- AND I ALSO KNOW HOW HARD THESE BILLS ARE TO DEAL- BECAUSE CERTAINLY OUR MEDICAL COMMUNITY FEELS AT THAT. IN ADDITION TO BEING PRACTITIONERS THEY HAVE CONTINUOUS RIGHT LEARNING TO DEAL ON SO MANY ISSUES- SO I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO MOVE BILLS THAT INCLUDE. YOU KNOW MORE TRIP. THROUGH THE PROCESS- AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND WAYS. THAT OUR MEDICAL COMMUNITY FEELS MORE CONFIDENT TO BE YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO BEST SERVE- THE PATIENT AND THAT'S BY KNOWING MORE NOT KNOWING LESS. OKAY THANK YOU. SERAPH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OBVIOUSLY THIS ISSUE OF THE OVER ARCHING ISSUE OF- TRANSGENDER HEALTH CARE IS A CONTROVERSIAL ONE THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN HERE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME EVEN MORE THAN A MINUTE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT. BUT YOU KNOW IT SAYS SINCE IT SEEMS TO ME THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT. PROVIDING A DIRECTORY. FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING SERVICES. TEN PROVIDING TO THOSE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO HOLD THEMSELVES OUT AS PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES SOME TRAINING ON HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE. PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT SO I GUESS THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BUT I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SAYING NONE- FOR THAT- CENTER WINNER FIRST BY ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH ME IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF I KNOW WE'VE MADE SOME. SIGNIFICANT MAINTENANCE TO THE BILL- BUT I THINK IT'S IN THE SPIRIT OF- TRYING TO COPE OF ACTUALLY WANTING TO SET A HIGHER STANDARD FOR THE CARE OF- TGI PATIENTS AND- I SAY THE CARE OF THIS NOT JUST DIRECT PATIENT CARE BUT ALSO THE- OVERALL HEALTH CARE. EXPERIENCE AS WELL AND- I WOULD MAKE NOTES THAT- IS- A AS A PHYSICIAN WHO TO TAKE SENIOR MY SCENE REQUIRED- EVERY EVERY TWO YEARS EVERY TIME EVERY NEW MODEL. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS WE HAVE TO LEARN AND KEEP UP WITH- BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE TO ALL OF OUR PATIENTS AND INCLUDES OUR TGI PATIENTS AND- DID YOU MISS AS I HEARD FROM YOUR TESTIMONY AND THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESSES SAID. THAT TOO OFTEN IS NOT HAPPENING AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT- I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT- I KNOW THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT OVER WHO'S TEACHING WELL THAT'S ACTUALLY THERE IS OVERSIGHT OVER REALLY CERTAINLY. OVERSEE CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE MEDICAL SIDE- YOU HAVE TO DO YOU POINT OUT SENATOR- WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND THE BEST EDUCATORS WE CAN WRITE AND THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS ALL PHYSICIANS BUT THE- OVERALL PROGRAM IS HAS TO BE OVERSEEN BY THE SEAMY SPONSORS AND THERE'S ALSO ACCREDITATION INVOLVED. SAMETIME AND OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS AT FOR IT SOMETIMES THE BOARD IS INVOLVED SO DAMPEN THE NURSING BOARD ONE WEEK. OVERSEAS THEIR SEE AND OTHERS OR OTHERS MAY HAVE ACCREDITATION BIASES WELL SO THAT'S WELL ESTABLISHED THAT'S HOW WE DO SEE IT THAT'S HOW YOU DO CONTINUING EDUCATION- THERE ARE STANDARDS OUT THERE FOR THAT- AND- THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO SURE OF THAT- WE HAVE FIVE QUALITY. CD- THIS. OTHER PART AS WELL IT IN THE AMENDMENT THAT I. THAT I'M HOPING THEY'LL SIMPLY MOVE- THE PURPOSE YOU BILL FOR IS ACTUALLY- ESTABLISHING STANDARDS QUALITY CARE BECAUSE ALL. IT'S NOT ABOUT TAKING A CLASS. RIGHT AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE WHO THAT MAY NOT KNOW ENOUGH FOR CLASSES IMPORTANT AND- BUT A QUALITY STANDARD THAT ACTUALLY MEASURES THE QUALITY CARE TO PROVIDING TO THIS POPULATION AND FRANKLY- YOU KNOW- IF- WHEN- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES WHEN. THE RISK WHEN THE- SALT IT IS IT IS NOT SATISFACTORY YOURS AROUND YES- THEN THE PROVIDERS ALSO NEED TO KNOW THAT LIKE BECAUSE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE HOW DO YOU DO AS EVALUATION RIGHT. FOR GENDER DYSPHORIA IS SO WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE DOING SUBSTANDARD EVALUATIONS RIGHT- WE WANT TO BE SURE TO THIS IS THAT- IF THEY GET QUALITY OF CARE AND SO FORTH. BUT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AGAIN I THINK AS YOU SAID- CENTER WIENER AND THAT. IS THAT THE- THE TEACHER POPULATION NEEDS TO BE SEEN RIGHT NOW AND TO BE RECOGNIZED AND THAT IT'S REAL. AND CELLS ARE THAT THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WELL SO AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH ME I KNOW WE DO A LOT OF WORK BACK AND FORTH- AND- BUT I'M GLAD THAT THERE IS I THINK HE SAID I HOPEFULLY WE HAVE RESULT THAT WILL AGAIN. IT'S NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE WE WANT CALIFORNIA TO BE THE FIRST SAYS BE NICE OF OTHER STATES RECTOR HEAD OF US IN THAT REGARD- NOT BECAUSE- BUT- BECAUSE THAT MEANS AT LEAST DIRECTOR WHAT'S HAPPENING SOMEWHERE ELSE AT LEAST CALIFORNIA. POLICE IS SENDING A NEED A HIGHER BAR AND- AND HOPEFULLY OTHER OTHER STATES WILL FOLLOW US IN THAT SO CERTAINLY- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TAKING AMENDMENTS OF RESTORING. THE BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WITH YOU. VERY MUCH MUCH MISTER. YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE HISTORY. OF OUR CARE SYSTEM. IN THIS COUNTRY- THERE'S SO MUCH. OF THERE'S MUCH. THERE SOME LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED SO MANY ADVANCES. BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN B. THE UGLY SIDE. AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HELPED AND THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO BE HARMED. OVER LOOK HISTORICALLY YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT. BLACK COMMUNITIES OFTEN HAVE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WHICH THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT YOU LOOK AT TO SKI. OR OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS BADLY ABUSED- BLACK PEOPLE. AND SO WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED DURING COLLUDED. WHEN THERE WAS A LACK OF CONFIDENCE HESITANCY TO GET CARE AND THE DISPARATE IMPACTS AND HARMS. THAT WAS THE RESULT IT. WON'T LOOK AT. HELP HELP HEALTHCARE IS TREATED WOMEN OVER TIME WHETHER IT WAS INSTITUTIONALIZING. YOU KNOW WOMEN FOR BEING QUOTE UNQUOTE HYSTERICAL. THAT WAS. SEVEN FOR A LONG TIME UNTIL NOT THAT LONG AGO AND OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WOMEN HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF LGBTQ COMMUNITY WERE USED TO BE YOU WERE YOUR LGBTQ. YOU COULD BE. THE WATER SHOCK THERAPY. INSTITUTIONALIZE SIMPLY FOR BEING WHO YOU ARE THAT WAS TO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND THAT AND IT HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM DOESN'T SEE PEOPLE WHO THEY ARE AND TREAT THEM WITH BASIC RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT RECOGNIZES THEM AS FULL HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT IS THE CASE. WITH TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND GENDER NON CONFORMING PEOPLE INTERSEX PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY THEY ARE REAL THEY'RE NOT MADE UP CONTRARY TO SOME OF THE- TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD. TODAY AND SOME OF THE POLITICAL RHETORIC WE HEAR OVER AND OVER. HI IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THEY AND THEY NEED HEALTH CARE. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO GET HEALTH CARE IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE TREATED POORLY AND OR TREATED BY SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY IDEA. WHO THEY ARE OR HOW TO INTERACT WITH THEM. AND THAT'S BAD FOR EVERYONE. AT FOR EVERYONE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT FORCING ANYONE TO GET ANY KIND OF HEALTH CARE SOME OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY WHICH IS FRANKLY NOT ON POINT WITH WHAT THIS BILL. IS ABOUT THIS BILL IS MAKING SURE THAT IF YOU ARE TRANSGENDER. IF YOU ARE TGI THAT YOU CAN WITH CONFIDENCE GO SEE A MEDICAL PROVIDER AND GET APPROPRIATE CARE. THAT'S SOMETHING SO BASIC THAT SOMETHING SO MANY OF US. TAKE FOR GRANTED BUT YOU'RE GONNA GO TO A DOCTOR THE DOCTOR IS GOING TO SORT OF BE A PRETTY MUCH UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE. AND WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH APPROPRIATE CARE BUT TGI PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL AIMS TO ADDRESS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'VE YOU'VE ALL HEARD ME TALK ABOUT MY A BILL PACKAGE. AND THIS IS A ANOTHER TWO OF THOSE OF THIS FIRST ONE IS SB TEN THIRTY FIVE- AND DEALING WITH THE CONTINUATION OF THE WORK ON LAURA'S LAW WE'VE ALL BEEN A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH ME AS WE'VE CONTINUED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT LAW- IN THIS LAW. S. B. TEN THIRTY FIVE WOULD MAKE EXPLICIT THAT SELF ADMINISTERED MEDICATIONS CAN BE INCLUDED IN ORDER FOR A DUTY. OR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT WHEN THEY'RE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE TREATMENT PLAN. I'VE BEEN WORKING THIS LEGISLATION IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO A DUTY PROGRAMS IN TWENTY TWENTY WE DID AB SEPT NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH REQUIRED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A. O. T. UNLESS A COUNTY SUPPOSED TO OPT OUT OF IT. AND AT THIS TIME WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO REPORT OVER THIRTY COUNTIES NOW HAVE NOW ADOPTED THE PROGRAM. ENSURING THAT THIS EFFECTIVE AND SAFE COMMUNITY BASED APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE THOSE IN- LAST YEAR SB FIVE OH SEVEN UPDATED THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS BY ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS EXITING INVOLUNTARY. BENEFIT FROM THE CONTINUED SERVICES. THAT MAKE SENSE WHEN SOMEONE EXITED SERVICES THAT YOU WOULD SAY- NOW THEY'RE NOT APPROPRIATE AND. THEN HAVE THEM SPIRAL BACK. TO INTO A CRISIS. TODAY GONNA INCORPORATE AT THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE STATE AUDITOR ON MEDICATIONS- WHEN THEY LOOKED AT ALL THIS THE COURT THE COURT CURRENT LAW ALLOWS COURT ORDER TREATMENT PLANS TO INCLUDE COORDINATION AND ACCESS TO MEDICATION BUT IT DOESN'T EXPLICITLY SAY THAT COULD BE PART OF YOUR TREATMENT PLAN- TO DISCREPANCY WAS HIGHLIGHTED THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT ON THE L. P. S. ACT. IN ACCORD TO THEIR FINDINGS THE PREVAILING FACTOR THAT DETERMINES WHY INDIVIDUAL CYCLE BACK INTO MORE RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS IS NON MEDICATION NONCOMPLIANCE- IN THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORTING ON A. O. T. IMPLEMENTATION A NOTE THAT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO ENCOURAGE AND ENSURE TREATMENT PLANS COMPLIANCE MAY INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO INCREASE NUMBER UPDATE MEDICATION HEARINGS MEDICATION OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AND OR ASSESSMENT FOR POTENTIAL HOSPITALIZATIONS. WE KNOW THAT MEDICATION HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED IN THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT IT HEARINGS IS AN ESSENTIAL TOOL THAT ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUALLY TO STAY SAFELY IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND AGAIN SOMETHING YOU CAN CHECK THE PERSON COMES BACK TO BEGINNING TO EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS YOU CAN SAY HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING YOUR MDICATION AS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP PEOPLE ON TRACK AND AGAIN NOT TO CYCLE BACK INTO CRISIS- SO THIS AGAIN WILL CONTINUE TO BE PART OF KEEPING PEOPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE LEVEL OF CARE- AND WITH ME TODAY- OR PEOPLE TO TESTIFY IS THE HONORABLE THOMAS ANDERSON JUDGE IN NEVADA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. AND DR ALEXIS T. AN ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

MEDICATION ALONG WITH SAFE HOUSING IMPROVE THE PUBLIC BOXES SUCCESS AT EVERY COURT APPEARANCE WE ADDRESS MEDICATION COMPLIANCE HOUSING THROUGH THE SOCIAL ACTIVITIES. PORTUGUESE MANAGERS DELIVER MEDICATIONS DAILY TO SOME PARTICIPANTS THE REPORTS HELP TO ENSURE THEIR COMPLIANCE IN THE CASE MANAGERS CHECKING WITH THE PARTICIPANTS MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK TO ACCEPT COMPLIANCE THROUGH THE PERSON COMES TO COURT THE JUDGE HAS AN AWARENESS OF WHAT ISSUES INCLUDING MEDICATION COMPLIANCE- OF CONCERN TO THE TREATMENT PROVIDER TO THE PARTICIPANTS. HAVING A PARTICIPANT IN FRONT OF A JUDGE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE TREATMENT PLAN. THAT PROVIDES NOT. JUST SUPERVISION OF BOTH THE PARTICIPANT AND PROVIDER AND ALSO RESEARCHERS A PARTICIPANT OF THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED JUST. FOR STEP GIVES A MARKET TO VOICE CONCERNS. I THINK THE PROPOSAL WHICH IS SET.

IF YOU'RE HERE OKAY EXCELLENT- TO BE FAIR YOU CAN YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE FOUR MINUTES BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION GOT FOUR MINUTES SO THA YOU DON'T USE ALL OF IT YOU DON'T NEED TO BUT- I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF- AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS. MAC GALLAGHER- PERSON FOREMOST I DO WANNA THANK CENTER I MEAN FOR AMENDMENTS- THE SELF ADMINISTERED AMENDMENT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO US AND IT DOES ELIMINATE. SOME OF OUR OPPOSITION UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL OF IT- AND THAT'S FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST WE DO HAVE A FILL MEDICATION AN OUTPATIENT SETTINGS. ALL RECENT INDIVIDUALS IN AN OUTPATIENT SETTING THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE. CAPACITY TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR BODIES. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS OR MEDICATIONS WITH BLACK BOX LABELS. THAT HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND SOMETIMES INDIVIDUALS DON'T TAKE MEDICATION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF MISCOMMUNICATION WITH THEIR PSYCHIATRIST THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN. OR VARIOUS OTHER REASONS- ANOTHER CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS THE LACK OF A CLEAR FORTUNATE MECHANISM. WHEN THE STATE AUDITOR ISSUED ITS REPORT AND MADE THIS RECOMMENDATION THE AUDITORS SUGGESTED ALSO HAVE A CLEAR PORCELAIN MECHANISM FOR INDIVIDUALS TAKING OR- BE REQUIRED TO TAKE THESE MEDICATIONS. SPECIFICALLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS REQUIRED TO SELF EMISSIONS MANY MEDICATION AND CHOSE NOT TO DO SO. WITH A FACE ADDITIONAL COURT HEARINGS WHAT INDIVIDUAL SHOW UP TO THEIR HOUSE AND ASK THEM IF THEY'RE TAKING MEDICATION. WHAT EXACTLY WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE. THE BILL AS IT'S TODAY. WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT SINCE IT'S PART OF THE TREATMENT PLAN AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE. OUT OF THE ACCORD WITH THEIR TREATMENT AND THEN WOULD BE SUBJECT POTENTIALLY TO A FIFTY ONE FIFTIES OR VARIOUS OTHER PROVISIONS WHERE. THEY COULD BE COMBINED WITH THEIR TREATMENT PLAN THEY COULD BE GOING TO OTHER MEETINGS THAT COULD BE CHECKING IN THE COULD BE RECEIVING SERVICES BUT MEDICATION MAC MIGHT JUST BE THE ONLY ISSUE. AND SO I BRING THOSE CONCERNS TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CENTER EGGMAN ON THIS AND- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE- ARE STILL IN OFFICE. OPPOSITION THANK YOU CARD THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE TAKE ON ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HERE ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED SAYING NONE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR WITNESSES WHO SHOULD TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. TO SB TEN THIRTY FIVE NAME ORGANIZATION POSITIONALLY. HE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. OUR FIRST LINE IS NINETY RIGHT. AS A POINT OF VIEW- SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. LAKE DAYLIGHT IN STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. EXLINE IS ONE THIRTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. WHITE ONE THIRTY YEARS LATER IS OPEN. CAN YOU HEAR ME ME YES PLEASE THE NAME MORE EFFICIENT POSITION. YES MY NAME IS KATIE. AND I AM A STRONG OPPOSITION IS ITSELF THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THE POINT IS TO NINETY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS CAROLYN RUBIO I AM A FORMER- PATIENT. OF MENTAL HEALTH YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY GOTTEN OFF OF MEDICATIONS AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE SO I WRONGLY OPPOSED TO STOP THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MR HERE WE HAVE NO FURTHER IF YOU AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU MODERATOR BRING BACK MANY MANY QUESTIONS THE COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER ROCK THAT SEEN OTHER COMMENTS- CENTER EVEN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW IT'S A- WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION- SOME CHALLENGES BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET OUT. OF THE SYSTEM FOR NO PATIENT TREATMENT- WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND YES WE JUST HAVE SOME PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES. AND- AND THAT'S OKAY RIGHT THAT THAT THAT IS OKAY. AND I THINK THE JUDGE NORTH LAID OUT WHAT COMPLIANCE LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT NON COMPLIANCE LOOKS LIKE VERY CLEARLY I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF ANY MEMBERS WANTED TWENTY HERE AND GO THROUGH IT AGAIN- BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN AND I WILL JUST POINT OUT. IN IN IN CLOSING- NEVADA COUNTY WAS WHERE THIS BEGAN BOLLORE'S LAW BEGAN BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE LAURA WILCOX WAS SHOT AND KILLED. BY SOMEBODY WHO WAS WAS NON COMPLIANT. AND HOW WE'VE BEEN ADOPTED A. O. T. AND JUST SAY YES WELL SOMEBODY. IS NOT UNDER THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY THE THEY HAVE BEEN DEEMED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. SUN COMMITTEE CRIME IN THE GO TO JAIL WHICH IS. OUR LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY RIGHT NOW- THEY LOSE THAT RIGHT RIGHT AWAY. SO WE HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE I THINK WE SHOULD TREAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY- AT THE LOWEST LEVEL POSSIBLE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I THINK IF I COULD JUST AS YOU WERE SAYING. THIS IS TO CLARIFY BECAUSE YOU HEARD SOME COUNTIES ARE ALREADY DOING IT MARIN COUNTY ALREADY DOING A LOT OF COUNTIES ARE ALREADY DOING THIS. VERY SUCCESSFULLY THIS IS A CLEAR FIGHT FOR THE COUNTIES WHO HAVE BEEN. MORE HESITANT THIS IS PART IS BEFORE THE TREATMENT ORDER. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY SINCE SECOND BY CENTER ROCK. CONTROL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HANDS HIM FIND MELINDA'S EGGMAN HI EGGMAN I GONZALEZ GROVE HER TADO LEYVA HI LEYVA AYE LEE MON THE MOON I ROTH AYE ROTH AYE RUBIO WIENER OKAY THE BILL CURRENTLY HAS FIVE LITTLE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN S. B. TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN THE SECOND BILL AND PRESENTED TODAY AS PART OF THE R. EIGHT BILL PACKAGE SB TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN WOULD PROVIDE ONE ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAY PERIOD OF INTENSIVE TREATMENT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CONSERVATORSHIP PROCEEDINGS IF A PERSON CURRENTLY CURRENTLY RECEIVING CARE IS LIKELY TO RECOVER WITH IT JUST A LITTLE MORE TREATMENT AND STABILIZATION- WHEN REALIZE RIGHT NOW SOMEONE GOES IN YOUR DEEMED A DANGER PUT OFF FIFTY TO FIFTY HOLD. THEY CAN BE CERTIFIED FOR MORE INTENSIVE TREATMENT GENTLY THREE DAYS IS NOT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO STABILIZE SOMEBODY WHO'S IN A HUGE PSYCHOTIC- HAVING AN EPISODE SO THAT THEY CAN BE TREATED. FOR AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN DAYS. AFTER IF A PERSON FOUND TO REMAIN GREATLY DISABLED UNWILLING TO ACCEPT VOLUNTARY TREATMENT AT THAT POINT THE PERSON MAY BE CERTIFIED FOR ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF NOT MORE THAN. THIRTY DAYS OF INTENSIVE TREATMENT. DURING THOSE SAME PROTECTIONS AS WE HAD BEFORE. AGAIN AS A WAY TO KEEP FROM MOVING ON TO THE CONSERVATIVE PROCESS. AND THIS THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS LET'S GIVE ANOTHER ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS. AS A AS A POSSIBILITY IF IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WILL RECOVER ENOUGH AGAIN TO MOVE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF CARE AND NOT INTO A CONSERVATORSHIP. PROCEEDING TO THE THIRTY DAY INTENSIVE TREATMENT IS ONLY AN OPTION AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING IT. AT THIS TIME TWENTY THREE COUNTY HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS OPTIONS AGAIN AS A WAY TO SAY YOU CAN'T DO THIS WE KNOW SOME ARE DOING IT SOME ARE NOT. THIS IS TO MAKE MORE STANDARDIZATION ACROSS OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM- IN WITH ME TODAY IS- DOCTOR SAGAN AND RANDALL HAGAR ON BEHALF OF THIS PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- AND CEDAR BOTH BY PHONE RIGHT US SO THAT'S A- MODERATE PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE RANDALL HAGAR FROM THE PSYCHIATRIC AND PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU HAVE THE TWO MINUTES THE TOTAL FOUR MINUTES AND THEN FOLLOWED- AGAIN BY DR ALEXIS SEGAN- FROM UC IRVINE- SO- RANDALL HAGAR. DR PAN THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS RANDALL BAKER I REPRESENT THE PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE THING- CENTER EGGMAN FOR OBVIOUS LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS BILL AS WELL AS THOSE IN THE- TOP PACKAGE OF EIGHT BILLS THAT ARE EIGHT THAT'LL HELP REFORM PACKAGE. WHICH PSYCHIATRIC ALLIANCES WITH A SPONSORED BY TWELVE. TWENTY SEVEN IS AT THE END OF THE DAY ABOUT PROVIDING THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME TO SEVERELY ILL AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS. ALSO AWAY ABOUT CONSERVATORSHIP IN THE SENSE THAT FROM TWENTY SEVEN HELPS US TO AVOID CONSUMERS SHE SHIPS. WHAT IT TAKES TO DO SO CONSERVATORSHIP SAGER INTRUSIVE INVENTORY- RESTRICTIVE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND O WHEN WE CAN PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE LESS RESTRICTION WE SHOULD DO SO IN THIS TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS. I WILL SAY JUST IN SUPPORT OF- THOSE POINTS THAT WE CAN'T RUSH RECOVERY. RECOVERY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS OFTEN PROCEEDS AT ITS OWN PACE- SO IN THIS INPATIENT SETTING WOULD BE SOLD TOO MANY OF OUR PATIENTS SO THEY ARE SICKER THAN. DECADES PAST. ON THE SYSTEM LEFT. FOR A LONG THERE ARE PROBLEMS. BUT BASS USE COULD BE HEALTH ISSUES. THEY PERCENT MORE COMPLEX- IN- TO A GENERATION AGO. AND SO WE NEED MORE TO READ THESE ISSUES FOR THE PATIENTS AND FINING RIGHT MEDICAID TO UNDER THESE CONDITIONS CAN BE A LENGTHY PROCESS AND ALL THAT COULD TAKE TIME SO SB TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN HELPS US. WITH A FEW PATIENTS ARE NOT QUITE THERE YET WHICH MEANS THEY MAKE PROGRESS THEY LIKELY WON'T NEED A CONSERVATORSHIP THAT THEY NEED MORE TIME TO RECOVER. AND GET TREATMENT SO THEY CAN BE DISCHARGED SAFELY IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY NEED TO BE REFERRED TO A CONSERVATORSHIP SB TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN PROVIDES. THAT TO- SB FOUR TWENTY SEVEN PER SERVICE YOU PROCESS AND CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND EARLY HOLDS AND ON BEHALF PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. APPLY INSPIRED SUPPORT. THANKS NOW SPRING ON DOCTORAL C. FROM THE FIRST FIFTY C. IRVINE. HI OKAY THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SO I'VE BEEN AS YOU MENTIONED DR LAXITY CAN I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRISTS. SB TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT PROMISES TO BOTH IMPROVE TREATMENT OUTCOMES AND DECREASED SERVICE COSTS FOR ALL PATIENTS WITH A SEVERE MENTALITY IF THEY'RE CONCERNED OR NOT CONCERNED. TO WIN AN INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALIZED WE HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION REGARDING CONSERVATORSHIP EARLY ON WITHIN THE FIRST. TWO WEEKS PERCENT HOSPITALIZATION. LIFE APPOINTED THAT APPLE. IN ORDER HELP THE PERMIT THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND THAT'S OFTEN THE FOR TREATMENT THAT REALLY HAD A SUFFICIENT TIME TO TAKE A FACT. IT BILITY UTILIZED SECOND THIRTY DAY HOLD WOULD SPARE FOR CONSERVATORSHIP THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE NEEDS ARE MORE SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED THROUGH ADDITIONAL TIME FOR INTENSIVE INPATIENT THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION. AT THE SAME TIME SB TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN HAS. OTHER IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THOSE WHO REALLY DO NEED CONSERVATORSHIP AND IT GREATLY IMPROVES THEIR ACCESS TO NECESSARY CONSERVATIVE A CONSERVATIVE RELATED SERVICES IN TWO WAYS. FIRST BY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS UNNECESSARILY REFERRED FOR CONSERVATORSHIP IT FREES UP THE SECOND HALF OF THE FOR SERVICE INDIVIDUALS WHO CLEARLY REQUIRE COURT EVALUATION POTENTIAL PATIENTS THE PLACEMENT. BECAUSE OF THE OFTEN UNMET DEMAND FOR CONTROVERSIAL RELATED SERVICES THE PLACEMENT- INDIVIDUALS WHO REQUIRE THE SERVICES ARE TOO OFTEN. NECESSARILY DESTRUCTION HOSPITAL CARE BEFORE THE SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH LPS CODE. AND AFTER DISCHARGE THEIR EXPOSED AND VULNERABLE IT'S. DANGER FAILURE AND READMISSION. SECONDLY UNLESS HIGH BURDEN PLACE RESOURCE FOR NEW CONCERT PEOPLE MAY PEOPLE WHO REQUIRE BECAUSE- TOO OFTEN IN THE HIGH. AT ALL AND IT. DATE FOR WEEKS MONTHS AND SOMEHOW HE'S UP TO IT- OVER A YEAR WELL WE THERE'S OPENINGS HOSPITALS- AYE INDEED. THE SITUATION NOT ONLY ANTI THERAPEUTIC AND A DELAY OF TRANSFER TO LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING IT ALSO BURNS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND HOSPITALS FOR PROVIDING ADMITTEDLY NON MEDICALLY NECESSARY INPATIENT SERVICES. WHICH ARE OFTEN NOT REIMBURSABLE THREE EITHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INSURANCE SO IN ESSENCE. DISABILITIES RAPIDLY. IMPROVED OKAY. POLITY OF- QUALITY FOR CONSERVATIVE AND CONSERVATIVE. WHO EXISTING RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY AND AVOID POTENTIAL- REIMBURSABLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED ROSS BARKLEY ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO DECEMBER IN SUPPORT I THANK YOU MICROPHONE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR WITNESSES WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF S.

ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THE LPS PACKAGE TO EXPAND INAPPROPRIATE INDEFINITE AN INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT. WE THINK RESOURCES SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO HELPING PEOPLE. GET OUT OF IN PATIENT CARE OUT OF LOCKSTEP CARE. AND INTO COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT. ANALYSIS NOTES A CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH AND- AND IN ADDITION.

MANY PEOPLE SITTING UP HERE TODAY THINK WHAT WE CURRENTLY. HAVE IS OKAY- WE HAVE PUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR SYSTEM THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO. INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE PROVIDING CARE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THOSE THINGS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO RETURN PEOPLE SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY- AND JUST. AS AN ASIDE I WAS DISCUSSING MOST OF MY FORMER COLLEAGUES WHO ARE STILL ACTIVELY WORKING IN THE FIELD ABOUT THIS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO A BILL THAT WILL IMPROVE ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES FOR PEOPLE SEEKING AN ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA BARRIERS TO ABORTION STILL EXISTS EVEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE WHO SEEK ABORTION RELATED REPRODUCTIVE CARE ARE IN A VULNERABLE PLACE BURKE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE OBSTACLES THEY FACE SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION LODGING WAIT SUPPORT SICK LEAVE WHICH AND CHILD CARE FOR WOMEN OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SEEKING AN ABORTION THESE BARRIERS INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY. THIS YEAR THE US SUPREME COURT IS REVIEWING A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO ROE V. WADE SHOULD THE COURT OVERTURNED A LONG STANDING LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR ABORTION SERVICES. ACTED UNDER THIS MONUMENTAL DECISION TWENTY SIX EIGHT STATES ARE CERTAIN OR LIKELY TO GAIN TO BAN ABORTIONS IMPACTING AS MANY AS THIRTY SIX MILLION WOMEN. AND PEOPLE WHO MAY BE BECOME PREGNANT ACCORDING TO A RECENT GOOD MOTT MARKER INSTITUTE REPORT CALIFORNIA MAY SEE THREE A 3000% INCREASE IN PEOPLE DRIVING TO CALIFORNIA FOR ABORTION CARE IF A TOTAL BAN WOULD IT TAKE PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES. IF THIS IS THE CASE PATIENTS WON'T NEED ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION LODGING AND CHILDCARE ABORTION PROVIDERS CAN EXPECT TO SEE A RISE IN DEMAND AND IN OVERALL OVERALL WORKLOAD. SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO WILL IMPROVE ACCESS TO DIRECT AND PRACTICAL SUPPORT FOR ABORTION PATIENTS DIRECT SUPPORT SUCH AS RIGHTS TO HEALTH CARE FACILITY IS SOMETIMES A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEEKING CARE. AND NOT FOR DECADES ABORTION FUNDS LIKE ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE INDEPENDENTLY FUNDRAISE TO DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY SUPPORT CALLERS AND PATIENTS WITH THESE NEEDS. SOME WASHING CLINICS ALSO SISTER PATIENTS WITH PRACTICAL SUPPORT NEEDS TO GET TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS YET MANY UNMET NEED HOWEVER IS FAR GREATER THAN THAT RESOURCES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. SB ELEVEN FORTY THREE FORTY TWO WHAT CREATE A LANDING PAGE OF CENTRALIZED INFORMATION FOR WOMEN SEEKING CARE IN CALIFORNIA THIS WILL BOTH COME BACK MISINFORMATION AND PROVIDE PATIENT ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO ACCESS ALL KINDS OF REPRODUCTIVE CARE THE SITE WILL INCLUDE COMPREHENSIVE AND MEDICALLY ACCURATE INFORMATION. ABOUT ABORTION PROVIDERS PROCEDURAL SUPPORT OPTIONS INFORMATION ON THE TYPES OF SERVICES AVAILABLE INSURANCE INFORMATION ALONG WITH LANGUAGE SUPPORT SERVICES. THE STATES OF WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK ALREADY HAVE CREATED LANDING PAGES TO DIRECT INFILL INDIVIDUALS TO LINKS FOR ABORTION CARE POST OPERATION RESOURCES. AT FUNDS AND MORE THE GOAL IS TO STRENGTHEN PRACTICAL SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE BY PROVIDING ONE POINT OF ENTRY TO CONNECT A PATIENT WITH THE NEW ARRESTER MOST ACCESSIBLE. PROVIDER OBTAIN HEALTH COVERAGE OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE CARE AND OBTAIN ASSISTANCE RULED A LOGISTICAL NEEDS. AS A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE CALIFORNIA MUST BE PREPARED TO TREAT PATIENTS WHO ARE SEEKING KERR IN THE STATE NAVIGATE THEM TO THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE. SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO IS JUST ONE OF MANY STEPS TO STATE CAN TAKE TO HELP ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY.

THAN IT IS TODAY CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE IS ONLY AROUND TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE AT THAT TIME. AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION ILLEGAL ABORTIONS EVERY YEAR. THOSE UNSAFE ABORTIONS CAUSED AS MANY AS FIVE THOUSAND ANNUAL DEATHS SO YOU COULD IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD FACE TODAY. THE NUMBER OF DEATHS WE FACE TODAY IF. THAT RIGHT IS DENIED. OSMOSIS STATES OF US. NOW IN OUR OWN STATE CALIFORNIA WELL WE HAVE GOOD ACCESS. WE'RE HUGE STATE AND MANY OF US HAVE DISTRICTS IN MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT- CO AUTHORS DEFINITELY ONE THE GEOGRAPHICALLY VERY LARGE. BEYOND WHERE THE PERSON WHO NEEDS THE SERVICES WHILE WE HAVE GREAT ACCESS IT COULD BE VERY FAR AWAY IT COULD BE MORE THAN A DAY'S TRAVEL AND SO THE TYPE OF. BY CREATING ESTABLISHING A FUND LIKE THIS BILL WOULD DO THEY WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ANY PERSON WHO NEEDS THIS HELP WHETHER THEY ARE COMING FROM ELSEWHERE OR WHETHER THEY ARE IN OUR OWN STATE- WHAT SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO DOES IS SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE. THAT CALIFORNIA CANNON WILL ACT TO PROTECT A PERSON'S RIGHT TO ALL REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES INCLUDING ABORTION AND CONNECTING THEM WITH SAFE.

MY NAME IS ABBY FELLOW AND I'M A PATIENT STORYTELLER WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD ADVOCATES MARMONT. AT AGE TWENTY SIX BY IT SALES AND SO BEGINS THE WEEK OF SEVERE STRESS SHAME AND CONFUSION ABOUT TRYING TO ACCESS AN ABORTION. I KNEW IT ALL FANS ABOUT THE TIME I GO TO A DOCTOR I'D NEVER MET. SHE THAT MY PART IS ACT. FOR NEED EMERGENCY SURGERY TO STOP THE BLEEDING. I AM TERRIFIED SO I AGREED TO THE PROCEDURE IMMEDIATELY. WHEN I WAKE UP I LEARNED THE PREGNANCY WASN'T ACTUALLY I THOUGHT THANK BUT DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS THE DOCTORS PERFORMED AT THE END. I'M TOLD THIS MEANS THE PREGNANCY IS OVER AND I CAN MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE. HOWEVER MY ONE WEEK CHECKUP AND STILL PREGNANT SO I SPEND THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS DOING NOTHING EXCEPT TRYING TO GET AN ABORTION. AT FIRST THE DOCTOR GAVE ME A PRESCRIPTION FOR MEDICAL ABORTION AND SENT ME TO A PHARMACY. AND SOCIALLY AND WHEN THE PHARMACIST SHOT THAT THIS MEDICATION CAN ONLY BE ADMINISTERED AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. WHEN I CALLED THE DOCTOR EXPLAINS THAT SHE CAN'T GIVE ME THE ABORTION IN HER OFFICE AND SHE'S EMPLOYED BY CAP THE CALL. ALL NOW I AM PANICKING CONFUSE I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER DOCTORS IN LA TO GO TO. I WISH SOMEONE WOULD JUST GIVE ME AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR HOW DOCTOR FOR THE PORTION. I WISH SOMEONE WOULD EXPLAIN HOW TO TELL MY OLDER MALE SUPERVISORS I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK FOR A WEEK AND MIGHT NEED MORE TIME OFF. SOBBING I CALL CLINIC DOCTOR CLINIC BUT CAN'T GET AN ABORTION ANYWHERE FOR A FEW WEEKS. EVEN THOUGH I OFFERED A COMMENT ANYTIME AND DRIVE ANYWHERE. IF I HAD TIME OR TRANSPORTATION CONSTRAINTS I MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT MUCH. I IMAGINE HOME POSSIBLE SCHEDULING AS BUFFY FOR PEOPLE CARING FOR A CHILD OR ELDERLY RELATIVES. I EVENTUALLY GET THE ABORTION BUT THE EXPERIENCE CONVINCED ME THAT MAKING CALIFORNIA STATE FOR PEOPLE TRULY HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE REQUIRED INSURING ALL PATIENTS. WHETHER THEY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA- COMING FROM OTHER STATES AND ACCESS TO TIMELY ABORTION ARE SUPPORTED ABOUT PASTA MOSTLY AND LOGISTICALLY AND GET HELP NAVIGATING EDUCATIONAL AND FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES KICKING THAT OUT OF YOUR LIFE BACK.

ELEVEN OPPOSITION IN PERSON SO BEGIN WITH US SUSAN ARE NOW WITH THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE FOLLOWED BY MOLLY SHEEHAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE- YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES A TOTAL FOUR MINUTES BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU SO. YOU PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU SENATOR PAN MY NAME IS SUSAN ARNOLD I'M A CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY AND VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGAL AFFAIRS AT THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE AMERICA'S FIRST PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING FIFTY TWO MEMBER PREGNANCY HEALTH CLINICS CENTERS AND MATERNITY HOMES IN EVERY ONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRO LIFE VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO PROPOSES TO FUND A MYRIAD OF SERVICES TO SUPPORT ABORTION TOURISM ALL FUNDED THROUGH A FANCY STATE FINANCED WEBSITE THE BILL TOTALLY IGNORES FUNDING FOR CHILD BIRTH THE OTHER REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE BECAUSE S. B. ELEVEN FORTY TWO IS SO ONE SIDED IN ITS FUNDING MAKING NO ACCOMMODATION FOR FUNDING CHILDBIRTH SERVICES IT VIOLATES THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THE UNEQUAL FINANCIAL TREATMENT OF ABORTION AND CHILD BIRTH BY THE STATE IS CLEARLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACCORDING TO COMMITTEE TO DEFEND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS VERSUS MYERS IN THAT CASE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE PRO LIFE LEGISLATURE VIOLATED THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONSTITUTION BY FINANCIALLY FAVORING CHILDBIRTH OVER ABORTION WITH A QUOTE CONDITIONING OF PUBLIC BENEFITS FRAMEWORK. TODAY MORE THAN FORTY YEARS LATER PRO ABORTION LEGISLATORS ARE ADVANCING SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO FAVORING ABORTION OVER CHILD BIRTH THE BILL MANDATES FUNDING QUOTE DIRECT LOGISTICAL AND PRACTICAL SUPPORT BUT ONLY FOR ABORTION PATIENTS THESE INCLUDE QUOTE AIRFARE LODGING GROUND TRANSPORTATION GAS MONEY MEALS DEPENDENT CHILD CARE DUELA SUPPORT AND TRANSLATION SERVICES TO HELP A PERSON ACCESS AND OBTAIN. AN ABORTION ON QUOTE THE BILL OFFERS A STATE FUNDED ABORTION VACATION INCLUDING PAYMENT SUPPORT RESOURCES TO QUOTE HELP PEOPLE WITH THE COST OF THE ABORTION PROCEDURE ON QUOTE. S. B. ELEVEN FORTY TWO DOES NOT PROVIDE SUCH ASSISTANCE OR BENEFITS TO THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO MISSILE BIRTH WHY NOT ISN'T BIRTH A CHOICE TO S. B. ELEVEN FORTY TO BLATANTLY FAVORS ONE REPRODUCED GROUP REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE OVER ANOTHER AND IT IS CON CONSTITUTIONAL PLEASE REJECT SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO THANK YOU. VIEW SO WE NOW HAVE A BUY SHE HAD AND- SHE LEFT YOU A MINUTE AND I THINK FORTY FIVE SECONDS OKAY THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MOLLY SHEEHAN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF PRIVATE NONPROFIT SOCIAL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE WORLD AND EVERY SINGLE DAY OUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZER'S GO INTO THE HOMES OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES FAMILIES IN POVERTY AND THESE FAMILY STATE WE CANNOT SURVIVE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. POOR WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T HAVE TIME OFF WORK WHO DON'T HAVE SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR KIDS WHO ARE LIVING WITH AN ABUSIVE PARTNER WHO DON'T HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO PRENATAL APPOINTMENTS WHO CAN'T PAY FOR GAS OR HOUSING INSECURE THEY FEEL THEY HAVE NO CHOICES. YEAH THIS BILL WOULD OFFER THOSE SAME SOLUTIONS TO WOMEN WHO ARE OUT OF STATE COMING HERE FOR ABORTIONS. LOW INCOME MOTHERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA AND OTHER STATES DO NOT WANT TO TRAVEL TO HAVE AN ABORTION THEY DO SO ONLY WHEN THEY FEEL THAT THAT'S THEIR OPTION IN A SITUATION THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE SAME WITH CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WHO SAY LOOK WE'RE PUTTING OFF HAVING CHILDREN FOR NOT HAVING CHILDREN WE WANT TO HAVE WE HAVE CHILDREN AND WE'RE NOT THRIVING. IF YOU'RE HOMELESS AND PREGNANT CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T RECEIVE A PRIORITY HOUSING UNTIL YOU'RE SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT. THESE MOTHERS HAVE TO PAY FOR PRENATAL CARE DELIVERY PROTECTION ALL THE CARE THEY RECEIVED THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY OUT OF POCKET AND THERE'S NO EQUITY FOR CALIFORNIA WOMEN AND FAMILIES OFFERING ABORTION AS THE ONLY SOLUTION WITHOUT ADDRESSING THESE REAL NEEDS IS TANTAMOUNT TO COERCION. MOST LOW INCOME WOMEN SELF IDENTIFY AS PRO LIFE ACCORDING TO GALLUP AND THE LOW INCOME MOTHERS WE WORK WITH EVERY DAY DO NOT WANT MORE ABORTION THEY WANT HELP TO BE PERRANCE. CHANNEL AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO PAY RENT TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE TO FIND HOUSING ON THE LONG WAIT LIST FOR DAY CARE DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. FAMILIES DESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES YES AND TO BE SUPPORTED WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO BE PARENTS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN ISRAELIS.

THANK YOU I EIGHTY FIVE PLEASE GOING. BY EIGHT FIVE. I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH THEY'LL BRING THE SET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SO SENATORS SKINNER AND COVER YOUR- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A WEBSITE TO BE ESTABLISHED SO THAT IT CAN LIST WHERE ONE CAN ACQUIRE AN ABORTION AND IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A FUND TO ASSIST THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING AN ABORTION RIGHT THAT'S THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF IT. THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE PIECES AND ONE IS A WEBSITE AND ONE IN RIGHT ON THE FUNDING OKAY FOR THE FUNDING- PURSUANT TO THE LEGISLATURE MAKING THE PREPARATION FOR THE FUNDS- THESE FUNDS WOULD COULD BE ACCESSED BY WHETHER SHE'S A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT OR NOT IS THAT CORRECT THE STATE FUNDS- WELL THAT IT THERE IS IT IS WE ANTICIPATE A FUND THE FUND WILL WOULD INCLUDE STATE RESOURCES AND THEN THEY WOULD INCLUDE- PHILANTHROPIC RESOURCES INCLUDING DONATIONS FROM INDIVIDUALS- RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS AS IT AS IF WE NEED TO SEGREGATE THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES- AND IT'S OUR ANTICIPATION THE STATE FUNDS WOULD BE USED FOR STATE RESIDENTS IN THE PHILANTHROPIC- FUND WOULD BE USED FOR OUT OF STATE- FOR. ANYBODY WHO- IS ASKING THE FOR- SERVICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OKAY THAT IS NOT OUTLINED IN THE BILL THOUGH THAT IS CORRECT ARE YOU PLANNING ON AMENDING IT YES. WE'RE WORKING ON ON EXACTLY HOW WE HAVE TO SET UP THE FUNDS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH. STATE LAW OKAY SO AT THIS POINT YOU'RE NOT CLEAR AS TO HOW. HE WOULD DO THAT. NO THIS TO AT THIS TIME IT'S CLEAR HOW WE WOULD DO THAT IT'S A QUESTION OF EXACTLY WHERE THE FUNDS WOULD BE AND HOW THEY WOULD BE ALLOCATED- ACTUALLY OF THIS WEEK OKAY THAT AND UNLESS UNLESS SOMEONE'S ASKING ASKING ME FOR THAT SORRY. S. S. S. IS VERY COMMON IN MANY BILLS WHEN YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS OF IMPLEMENTATION IN BECAUSE OF OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BEEN MEETING WITH. YES FUNDS STATE AGENCIES TO. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STRUCTURE WAS EXACTLY RIGHT AND WE'VE NOT LANDED ON THAT BUT WE HAD FOR EXAMPLE MEETING TODAY ON THE QUESTION AND SO WE WILL BE AMENDING IT SO THAT IT OUTLINES EXACTLY WHAT THE THAT DIFFERENCE IN ANY OTHER DIFFERENCES WE NEED FOR THE FUND TO BE ESTABLISHED APPROPRIATELY SO CAN I ASK- WHAT'S THE RUSH I MEAN IT THIS SEEMS COMPLICATED ON HOW YOU MIGHT COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE FOR EXAMPLE- IF WE TAKES NOT A BELL STYLE NO IT'S NOT IN THE BILL YET BECAUSE- THE TODAY THIS THE FIRST HEARING ENDED. THAT'S WERE PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESSYOUR WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE STILL HAVE OTHER COMMITTEES THAT WILL HAVE TO BE VITAL INTEREST I IF I GET THAT IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OFTENTIMES BILLS ARE AMENDED ALONG THE WAY DISSATISFIED THE CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE- MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS BUT BUT GENERALLY THE BILL IS- YOU KNOW GOT MORE. IS MORE COOKED THAN THIS BUT- THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE- SO YOU TURN OF MY BILLS THAT STILL NEED IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS. SO THE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR- THOSE WHO COME TO CALIFORNIA FROM OUT OF STATE FOR- AN ABORTION. AND. I GUESS. RIGHT I KNOW YOU MADE MENTION DURING YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT- IT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF NATIONWIDE PRESS ON THIS BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE TEXAS ABORTION BILL IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS WITH HELD- YOU KNOW LEGALLY I MEAN THAT'S IT SO I AM YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE SUPREME COURT MAY RULE ON THIS BUT THEY HAVEN'T I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL AND COULD POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO- BUT- A- I GUESS IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT- RIGHT YOU KNOW I. I GUESS PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS PROBABLY VERY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO STAND TO BENEFIT THE MOST- THANKS TO THE TAXPAYERS IN ANY PHILANTHROPIC EFFORTS- BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT A BILL THAT. SEEKS TO SNUFF OUT THE LIFE OF A HUMAN BEING THAT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL- DIFFERENCE OBVIOUSLY NUMBER I ALSO DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE WOULD THAT THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA WOULD WOULD PAY FOR THAT I JUST I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THOSE THROUGH TWO THINGS COMBINED I'M SURE THIS COMES AS A SURPRISE TO YOU ON THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I JUST. I WILL END MY COMMENTS BY SAYING THAT- I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S STATEMENT THAT HE WANTED CALIFORNIA TO BECOME THE ABORTION SANCTUARY WHICH I CAN THINK OF MANY MANY THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE KNOWN FOR THAT IS NOT ONE OF THEM- BUT I YOU KNOW MY GUESS IS IT'S COMING FROM THAT AND THIS IS A WAY TO HELP IMPLEMENT HIS VISION- BUT IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO ASK- OTHER PEOPLE TO PAY FOR- SOMEONE ELSE'S ABORTIONS SO- I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU SIR MELENDEZ- CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- I THINK THE TAXPAYERS SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE SUPPORTING- PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE INCLUDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING ABORTION- AND I AND I WAS OTHER STATES- MOVED TO- EFFECTIVELY BAN ABORTION I THINK OKLAHOMA IS THE LATEST ONE- AS WE SEE THE TRAIN WRECK THAT. IS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT- I THINK I THINK IT'S CRITICAL AND LIFESAVING FOR CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME AND SEE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IF THEY'RE BANNED AND CRIMINALIZED- DOING SO IN THEIR OWN- IN THEIR OWN STATE I'M PEOPLE DO ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO FLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND GET A HOTEL ROOM AND PAY FOR CARE. NOT EVERYONE CAN DO THAT ABOUT THEIR PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO HAVE ACCESS SO I THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY. IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S TERRIFYING WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING THAT THEIR WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE LOW INCOME WOMEN PEOPLE WHO AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHO ARE AND WHO ARE GOING TO BE. EFFECTIVELY FORCED BY THE STATE THEY LIVE IN- TO CARRY A PREGNANCY TO TERM THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE AND DO NOT WANT TO CARRY TO TERM OR NOT. SO I'M IT IS LITERALLY. THEM COMMANDEER THEIR BODY AND TELLING THEM YOU MUST CARRY TO TERM. AND THAT IS NOT TO ME THAT'S NOT. AMERICAN THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT- THIS IS COUNTRY IS ABOUT. FREEDOM AND IT IS ABOUT- PEOPLE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES- AND SO- I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL- I NOTICED THAT THE- CO AUTHOR LISTS ARE- ALL ONE GENDER IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING- MALE CO AUTHORS I WOULD LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR IF NOT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND- AND- HUNDREDS. WE WOULD WELCOME YOU- YES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TWENTY MEMBERS FACING NONE- BUCKLEY IS EIGHT I THINK CENTER LEADER PROBABLY CAPTURED A LOT OF IN HIS REMARKS FOR AT LEAST FOR MYSELF AND PERHAPS RATHER'S AS WELL O- AND YOU'VE MADE OF I THINK YOU'VE PRETTY WELL PRESENTED THE ISSUES TWELVE SO- CERTAINLY GOING TO BE IN SUPPORT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WILL DROP TO THE CLOSING OF AB SENATOR WIENER AS MY CLOTHES AND I RESPECTFULLY. ASK YOUR AYE VOTE OKAY THANK YOU. WAS THERE A MO YEAH SO MOVED. HER EXPENSIVE FIGHT.

LEYVA EILEEN MOANED. ROTH ROTH AYE RUBIO AYE RUBIO AYE WIENER. AYE WIENER AYE RIGHT THAT'S CURRENTLY SIX ONE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY I SEE THAT WE HAVE SENATOR GLAZERS HERE- SO I THINK- TO THAT ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. SIR GLAZER. THANK YOU FOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. AND FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR ON THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE GOOD WORK ON THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- I'VE AUTHORED SB FOURTEEN THIRTY FIVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE A REGISTERED NURSE TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT OR AVAILABLE VIA TELEHEALTH FOR BLOOD DONATIONS. NATIONWIDE BLOOD CENTERS ARE FACING A BLOOD CRISIS. THE WORST BLOOD SHORTAGE IN OVER. A DECADE. DOCTORS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHO RECEIVES BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS. AND WHO WILL NEED TO WAIT UNTIL MORE PRODUCTS BECOME AVAILABLE. THIS PAST JANUARY YES JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS. HARBOR UCLA MEDICAL CENTER A PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CLOSE ITS TRAUMA CENTER FOR TWO HOURS BECAUSE IT RAN OUT OF BLOOD FOR PATIENTS. IN ADDITION THOUSANDS OF BLOOD DONATIONS ACROSS THE STATE ARE LOST EACH YEAR AS A RESULT OF BLOOD DRIVES CANCELED AT THE LAST MINUTE. TO DO OUR AND STAFFING CHALLENGES. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE. THAT MANDATES THAT A REGISTERED NURSE BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT AT ALL SITES WHENEVER BLOOD IS DONATED. TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE DURING THE PANDEMIC BLOOD BANKS WERE ALLOWED TO DEVIATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE REGISTERED NURSE TO BE AVAILABLE ON SITE. BUT A REGISTERED NURSE WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO BE ON SITE COVERAGE OF THAT BLOOD DRIVE OPERATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE UTILIZATION. OF A REGISTERED NURSE VIS A VIS TELEHEALTH. BASED ON DATA FROM THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE BLOOD DRIVE OPERATIONS WHICH COLLECTED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PLUS RED CELLS AND SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS. BOB PLATELETS UTILIZING OUR INTEL HEALTH SUPPORT. THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IF THEY ARE AND HAD TO BE AVAILABLE ONSITE. DATA ALSO SHOWS THE DONOR SAFETY WAS NOT IMPACTED DURING ANY OF THESE BLOOD DRIVES. THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT BLOOD IS COLLECTED SAFELY AND UNDER SUPERVISION OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR. OR THE PERSON IN CHARGE FOR THE TELEHEALTH NURSE IT WOULD PROVIDE FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO RURAL COMMUNITIES. IT WILL PROVIDE FOR INCREASED AMOUNTS OF BLOOD DURING CRITICAL PERIODS. AND IT WOULD REDUCE COSTS TO BLOOD BANKS. TELEHEALTH IS BEING USED FREQUENTLY IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THIS BILL WOULD PERMIT AND ARE AND TO BE AVAILABLE VIA TELEHEALTH. TO PROVIDE NECESSARY NURSING SKILLS AND EXPERTISE DURING THE DONATION PROCESS LIKE INTRODUCED DOCTOR HERRON THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AT THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. AND DOCTOR HUGHES THE SENIOR MEDICAL OFFICER AT VIOLENCE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU SO- DOCTOR AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO GIVE YOU TWO MINUTE WARNING AND THEN- AND THEN TOTAL FORM IS BETWEEN THE TWO SO YOU GO OVER THE DOCTOR HUGHES HAS LESS TIME SUCH AS- OKAY JERRY BEGAN IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- DR RUSS HERE AND DIVISIONAL CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR AMERICAN RED CROSS BY MEDICAL SERVICES. ALSO THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE AMERICAN RED CROSS THEME OF VIGILANCE PROGRAM. CAME OF AGE IN ITS THEM. IN A VALUATION OF BLOOD DONOR FIFTY IN PENN TRANSFUSION RELATED PATIENT SAFETY- THE AMERICAN RED CROSS STRONGLY SUPPORT SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. THE TOP PRIORITY OF THE RED CROSS TO SAFETY OF BLOOD DONORS AND SAFETY TRANSFUSED PATIENTS. WITHOUT READILY AVAILABLE BLOOD PRODUCTS AS SEEN WITH THE HISTORY MAKING NATIONAL BLOOD CRISIS. PHYSICIANS MUST MAKE DIFFICULT CRISIS STANDARDS OF CARE DECISIONS IN PATIENT CARE SUFFERS. DURING THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC EMERGENCY IN THE NATIONAL BLOOD CRISIS AVAILABLE BLOOD DONORS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DONATE BLOOD DUE TO CANCEL BLOOD DRIVES AN INABILITY TO SCHEDULE BLOOD DRIVES DUE TO STAFF SHORTAGES. IN WITHOUT THE USE OF EMERGING. TELL THIS. WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE. UPDATED FIGURES FROM MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TO MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO THERE OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED RED CROSS BLOOD DRIVES WOULD UTILIZE TELEHEALTH REGISTERED NURSE COVERAGE. THAT WAS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND BLOOD DONATIONS OF ALL BLOOD AND ABOUT NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DONATIONS OF PLATELETS. ARE AND STAFF SHORTAGES IN CALIFORNIA BUT A LONG TERM PROBLEM WE CONTINUE TO BE SO. IN CALIFORNIA THE RED CROSS HAS TWENTY THREE ARE IN POSITIONS CURRENTLY OPEN. THIRTEEN OF THOSE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR OVER ONE YEAR. IT CROSSES EXPERIENCE YOUR ISSUES AFFECT ACCESSING OUR ENDS WITH TELEHEALTH OPTIONS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MANY PRIOR YEARS EXPERIENCE OF ACCESSING RED CROSS DITIONS ROUTINELY BY TELEPHONE AND OTHER VIRTUAL MEANS. IN A RED CROSS- BUT REGIONS THAT HAVE HAD A DEDICATED PHYSICIAN STAFF AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. TO CONSULT ON ANY MEDICAL CONCERNS RELATED TO ANY OF THE PLEDGE DRIVES. BLOOD DONORS A HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXTENSIVELY SCREENED FOR DAR ELIGIBILITY AND THE RED CROSS MANAGES DONOR COMPLICATIONS ACCORDING TO PROCEDURES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED NATIONWIDE BY RED CROSS MEDICAL IRECTORS- REACTIONS ARE HANDLED BY THIS ALL. IN THE SAME MANNER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER REGISTERED NURSE OR UNLICENSED STAFF MEMBERS ASSISTING WITH THE COMPLICATION. HAS MENTIONED CALIFORNIA THE ONLY STATE THAT MANDATES THAT A REGISTERED NURSE BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT AT ALL SITES WHENEVER BLOOD IS DONATED TO MINUTES. DESPITE THIS REQUIREMENT RED CROSS DONOR HIM OF ITS AND STATUS- NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RED CROSS. REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER GREGIS NATIONWIDE- USING REAL WORLD DATA FROM THE UP BEFORE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND ALSO DURING THAT AND PANDEMIC EMERGENCY. WE'VE SHOWN- THAT USING OUR INTEL HEALTH CAN BE EFFECTIVE. FOR SAFETY AND AVAILABILITY THE RED CROSS STRONGLY SUPPORT SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE IT PROMOTES BLOOD AVAILABILITY FOR PATIENT CARE THAT'S PROMOTING PATIENT SAFETY. AND RETAIN THE HIGH STANDARDS OF DONOR SAFETY THEY'VE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CALIFORNIA. DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF WAR AND TELEHEALTH COVERAGE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND THE DOCTOR USUALLY BE NEXT. OKAY DR. HUSING LEFT TWO MINUTES TWENTY SECONDS.

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES RELATED TO INVENTORY AS WELL AS STAFFING CHALLENGES.

YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ENCOURAGE LINE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED NURSES IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE OPPOSE AT THE FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH WOULD IT AND THE REQUIREMENT. THAT THE BANKS HAVE A REGISTERED NURSE FIFTY PRESENT DURING BLOOD DRAWS AND OTHER PROCEDURES. INSTEAD WOULD ALLOW THE REGISTERED NURSES O MONITOR THE PROCEDURES TO BE A TELECONFERENCE NURSES ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT PATIENT SAFETY WILL BE PUT AT RISK BY THIS CHANGE. THAT IS AS IT HAS BECOME A PAINFULLY CLEAR FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS THE CONFERENCE SERVICES ARE FREE WE ON RELIABLE. THIS RISK WOULD BE- EVEN BE EXASPERATED AND RURAL AREAS LESS RELIABLE INTERNET OR PHONE SERVICE. AND THESE RURAL AREAS ALSO LIKE THE INVOLVED WATER TRAVEL TIME TO EMERGENCY CARE CREATING ADDITIONAL RISKS TO THOSE DONATING. HEALTHCARE WORKERS SIMPLY CAN'T INTERPRET SOMEONE'S PHYSICAL REACTION TO BLOOD BANK PROCEDURES OVER THE PHONE OR EVEN BY VIDEO CONFERENCING AS WELL AS CAN BE DONE AND- PERSON. THE COLLECTION OF WHOLE BLOOD FROM HEALTHY DONORS IS ONLY ONE PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN BURBANK SETTING OTHER PROCEDURES THAT INVOLVE A POTENTIAL FOR GREATER RISK INCLUDE AFTER REESE'S APRIL RECESS. DURING WHICH A PARTICULAR BLOOD COMPONENT IS OBTAINED FROM A DONOR AND SEPARATE OUT FOR COLLECTION AND THE REMAINING BLOOD IS RETURNED TO THE DONOR AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR CALIFORNIANS NURSES- MUST BE ON THE PREMISES FOR THIS AND OTHER PROCEDURES. ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TEENAGE BLOOD DONORS. COMPRISED A LARGE AND- BOB. A BLOW DON'T BLOOD DONORS IN THE STATES. ALTHOUGH BLOOD DONATION IS IF PROCEED. ADVERSE REACTIONS IN INJURIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF SEVERE REACTIONS AND INJURIES OCCUR AMONG TEENAGE WHOLE BLOOD DONORS COMPARED TO ADULT AREN'T DONORS ACROSS ALL AGE GROUPS. I HAVE INDICATE THAT THE PRACTICE OF TELEMEDICINE BOARD FISHING IN FACEBOOK COLLECTION ROB THE STATE IS SAFE NECESSARY IMPRACTICAL HOWEVER RESTRICTION DURING THE COPA PANDEMIC RESULTING IN A 52% DROP. IN COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL BLOOD DRIVE FROM THE PANDEMIC WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WHEN THE BLOOD DRIVE TO RESTART THIS TEENAGE POPULATION WILL BE AT RISK OF NURSES ARE NOT PRESENT ON THE PRINCES. PROPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE HAVE ALSO INDICATED THAT BY REMOVING THE RESTRICTION THAT NURSES SPECIFICALLY PRESIDENT AT A BLOOD FOR ALL THE LOVE TO MARRY THEIR INCREASES IN BLOOD. DONATIONS IF THE SORT OF BLOOD OR DONORS IN A IS A NATIONWIDE PROBLEM LEAD TO BE CAUSED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS. EVEN STATE THAT DO NOT REQUIRE ARMENIANS ARE ALSO SEEN DROPS IN DONATIONS IS NOT RELATED TO DIFFICULTY HIRING RN'S. LOUDLY IT IS NOT UNIQUE THAT CALIFORNIA'S THE LOAN STATE HOLDING UP SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR ITS CITIZENS MANY STATES ALLOW AYE FROM FOLKESTONE MINISTER MEDICATION AND PERFORM OTHER DUTIES THAT ARE PROBABLY FOR LIFE AND- PERSONNEL BUT THE DATA THAT DOES NOT MEAN.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU. OKAY WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU MISTER CHAIR- YOU KNOW I WANNA JUST BE RESPECTFUL OF BOTH SIDES HER DADDY'S THE COMMENTARY NINETY NINERS DOWN YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE IS AS PERSONAL FOR THE NURSES AND I ACTUALLY SAT DOWN I'M SORRY IT INTO TOWN I ZOOMED WITH THEM- TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND- BOB AND I KNOW I HEARD- THE CENTER SAY THAT IN FORTY NINE STATES- BUT THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE A REGISTERED NURSE SO I WILL AGREE WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO SAID AND I BELIEVE HE'S A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NURSES WHO SAID THAT. JUST BECAUSE OTHER STATES DON'T REQUIRE INTEREST DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO SEARCH IF IT IF IT YOU KNOW IF IT'S NOT SAFE FOR- FOR PATIENTS BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH I DID TRY TO FIND INFORMATION ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS YOU KNOW AND I DID INVITE THEM TO SHARE ANY INFORMATION I WOULD SAY AT ANY GIVEN TIME IF IT'S DANGEROUS AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR THE SAYS IT'S DANGEROUS I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT- WE ARE. GOING THROUGH SOME CHALLENGES AND CHANCES SHORTAGE THIS NOT ONLY NURSES BUT ALSO BLOOD DRIVES AND YOU KNOW I'M A DONOR SO YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR PATIENTS BUT AND I WANT TO BE RESPECT FOR THE FACT THAT I YOU KNOW GAVE IT EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THAT INFORMATION THAT. THAT SAID IT WAS DANGEROUS AND I STILL DON'T HOUSE DOT- I DO WANT TO- MAYBE SUCH US ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WAS THAT IN MAYBE RURAL AREAS IS MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THERE'S A LONGER WAIT TIMES IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING HAPPENS AT FOR AN AMBULANCE TO GET THERE ARE TO GET TO A HOSPITAL MAYBE IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO HAVE ABOUT. POSSIBLY BILLS EMOTE AREAS THAT MAY BE MORE DANGEROUS BUT NOT YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND SO I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL BUT- YOU KNOW I HOPE. THAT THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A CENTER WE WHAT THEY THOUGHT FOR BRING US FOR AND I DO SUPPORT- THIS BILL OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING BUT WE TO YOURSELF I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE BLOOD BECAUSE IT CAME OUT I AM BANNED FROM GIVING BLOOD BUT I- I FULLY- I DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLOWED TO GIVE BLOOD BUT TO DO SO AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PRETTY SEVERE. BLOOD SHORTAGE IN THE CAR VERY BAD- DURING THE PANDEMIC- AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE NEED SOMETIMES MOREFLEXIBILITY AND SO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE- WITH- WITH WITH- STI TESTING A DOCTOR POSITION TO SEE IT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE. PHYSICALLY THERE WALL STI TESTING IS HAPPENING BECAUSE WE WANTED TO EXPAND CAPACITY FOR STI- TESTING ON WE DID A BILL TO YOU KNOW EXPAND- ACCESS BY ALLOWING ATVS COUNSELORS TO ADMINISTER RAPID SYPHILIS TEST- THE- OBG LANDS OPPOSED- THAT- YOU WE MATT AND ULTIMATELY WE PASSED AS PART OF BOTH THE CHAIR KERRY. AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK EVERYONE WANTS PATIENT SAFETY AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK WE CAN HAVE PATIENT SAFETY WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT WE ARE- GETTING MORE BLOOD DONATIONS- WE DO NEED A LOT MORE NURSES AND THE NURSING PROFESSION- WAS ALWAYS HARD AND IT IS KIND OF BEEN REALLY HARD HIT BY THIS PANDEMIC AND- AND- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NURSES WHO CHOSE. TO LEAVE THE PROFESSION. BECAUSE OF THE- DOUBLE STRESS AND TRAUMA F THIS. AND WE NEED. TO READ TO HAVE MORE NURSES- BUT NOT FOR NOW- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AND- AND WE NEED FOR BLOOD DONATIONS SO- RESPECTFULLY TO THE OPPOSITION I SUPPORT. CENTER EGGMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER FOR BRING THIS FORWARD I MEAN THE ABILITY TO DONATE AND RECEIVE BLOOD WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED I THINK IS CRITICAL NOPE AND NOBODY ARGUES WITH THAT- I WOULD OLD JUST ASK THIS BILL IS PERMISSIVE RIGHT IT DOESN'T MANDATE THAT THERE NOT BE AN R. AND ON IT'S JUST PER MISSIVE THAT IF NECESSARY ONE CAN BE AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE TELLER MOTORS ARE CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY SO BECAUSE I'M THINKING LIKE IT'S IN THE ISSUES OF BEING OUT IN REMOTE AREAS PERHAPS THAT CLINIC WOULD OPT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS ALTHOUGH WE KNOW WHAT TELEHEALTH. ARBOR MODE AREAS THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO BEAUTIFULLY INCREASE PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO USE TELEHEALTH- IN MORE WAYS- AND JUST LIKE LOOK LIKE WE HAVE EXTENDED. THE THE MEAN PHYSICIANS. OVERSEE NURSE PRACTITIONERS. AND IT'S RIGHT RIGHT AND NEVER VERY RARELY IN PERSON. WE HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE OF TO BE REQUIRING A HIGHER LEVEL DEGREE BUT THAT PERSON NOT BEING ON SITE BUT THAT WORK IS GOING ON. NOBODY SAID LIKE THAT LIKE GENERAL HERE I WAS IN THE MILITARY AND I WAS A- A MEDIC- BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT PRACTICE IN THE MILITARY- IS QUITE DIFFERENT AND IT'S MORE LIKE WHAT WHAT YOU CAN DO YOU GET TO DO- SO. WE HAVE DONE FINE IN THE ARMED FORCES BEING ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION. OFTENTIMES BEING ABLE TO MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE- SO I WOULD YOU KNOW AT A DEEP RESPECT FOR THE NURSES IN THE PROFESSION. I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER STEP WE CAN TAKE FORWARD TO INCREASE ACCESS. AND I WOULD MOVED ABILITY PROTECT. OKAY BILLS AND MOVE AYE SIR EGGMAN. CHIRLA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING BILL FORWARD I WOULD ASK. THAT HE REDOUBLED HIS EFFORTS AND OF HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION OR TO WITH THOSE WHO STATED SOME OPPOSITION BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE DONOR SAFETY- AT LEAST IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE PERHAPS THE ROLLER IS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUES. I AM HEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT I. IF I HEARD MY YORK HER FRIENDS CIVILIAN LABOR TODAY INDICATE THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO FIX THAT BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THOSE OF US IN. ANOTHER COMMITTEE HERE IN THE SENATE HAVE HEARD TO THE CONTRARY THAT BY SOME IN THE PROFESSION AND SOME IN LABOR THAT THERE IS NO WORK TWENTY FOUR SHORTAGE. AND NO SHORTAGE OF NURSES IN THE STATE CURRENTLY IN IN FACT- TO HAVE UTILIZE THAT CERTAINLY IN THE PAST TO LIMIT THE PRODUCTION OF NURSES IN OUR NURSING SCHOOL SO. PERHAPS WE'VE NOW UNIFIED OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING. ON THE THOUGHT THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE AND WE WILL START CURING THAT. SHORTAGE BY THE PRODUCTION OF. VALUABLE NURSES TO WORK TO SERVE THE POPULATION OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN THAT SHORTAGE OF BATES- WE CAN PERHAPS REVISIT THIS ISSUE. OF HAVING ARE IN THIS- ED TO BLOOD DONATION SITES. BUT FOR NOW I SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK THE OTHER FOR BRING IT FORWARD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY FIFTEEN A SEVEN GLAZER- TO APPRECIATE- YOU BRING THIS BILL FOR A FULL DISCLOSURE OF BEFORE I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE DID SERVE ON A BOARD OF A BLOOD BANK- AND- POSITION AND OF COURSE THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE- SAFETY. PROTOCOLS THAT WERE INVOLVED. IN AND ALSO YOU KNOW FOR AGAIN MY FRIENDS AND- THE LABOR COMMUNITY I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED- BUT ULTIMATELY OF COURSE THOSE CONCERNS NEED TO BE BACKED UP BY DATA. AND SO I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE LIKE EVERY OTHER STATE- THAT- WERE. WE CAN BE UNIQUE- BUT THAT EXPERIENCE AND ALL THOSE OTHER STATES CAN HELP INFORM. WHETHER WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE OR NOT. AND I THINK AT LEAST AND I APPRECIATE THAT RUBIO'S COMMENTS LIKE I I'VE BEEN CHALLENGE IN FINDING THE DATA. SHOWS THAT DOING THIS IS. RAISES A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN OR EVEN A MINOR SAY CONCERN IN ADDITION THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS ACTUALLY UNDER COVERT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC OF BUT- AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT NOT ONLY OF COURSE AND DRESS THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO STEVEN HERE IN OUR STATE. I DO ACKNOWLEDGE AGAIN TESTIMONY OF. NURSES ASSOCIATION APPRECIATING THAT- NO IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE FOR FEWER PATIENTS SAID CETERA SO MAYBE IT'S LESS LIKELY WILL PICK SOMETHING UP BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THE SAFETY SIGNAL COMING UP SANDERS A- PERSON OF CONSENT TO CONCERN. I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR- THE OPPOSITION IS THAT IF YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IF THERE IS. A SIGN OF A SAFETY CONCERN THEN CERTAINLY WE WANT TO ADDRESS THAT AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE MITIGATE THAT AND WE WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN OTHER STATES IF THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROTECT HIS ADDRESS AT SAFETY. BUT THIS POINT HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED IN TERMS OF FINDING THAT CONCERN. AND SO WITH THAT- WILL BE SUPPORTING- THIS BILL TODAY AND- SENATE GLAZER WHICH I'D LIKE TO CLOSE THE TICKET AT CHAIR PAN AND MEMBERS FOR THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION. I AM THAT I AM ALSO A DONOR- MANY MANY MANY TIMES. I THINK PATIENTS TO SAFETY REALLY IS THE DRIVER FOR THIS AND ALL OF OUR HEALTH POLICY. AND IF THERE WAS SAID DATA PROVIDED THAT SHOWS THERE WAS ANY ENHANCE RISK I THINK WE WOULD ALL TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. BUT THERE IS NO DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A CONCERN- I WOULD NOTE THAT- IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS AND THANK YOU FOR THE STAFF FOR DOING AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS ON PAGE TWO. THE TALKS ABOUT THE CRITERIA FOR DONATIONS AND ONE OF THEM DEALS WITH IF THERE WAS TO BE AN ADVERSE REACTION THIS REPLY TO A RURAL AREA. THAT- THERE TO HELP THE NEED TO BE FILLED NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES AWAY. SO THAT STANDARD IS APPLIED APPLICABLES WHEREVER IT THAT DOES DONATIONS- ARE HAPPENING. AND I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD GO DOWN A LONG WAYS TO MAKING PEOPLE COMFORTABLE THAT- THAT THAT THE STANDARD WOULD BE IN PLACE. THAT SAFETY STAND WOULD BE IN PLACE- THE THESE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING BLOOD DONOR THE RED AND I THERE THEY'RE NOT PROFIT MAY GROUPS HERE THERE THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE FOR THE COMMUNITY FOR PATIENT SAFETY AND- I APPRECIATE THEIR LEADERSHIP AND AS WE ALL DO- THIS BILL REALLY IS BEST IS ABOUT MAKING SURE WE CAN HAVE LIFESAVING CARE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASTRONAUT VOTE. COULD THANK YOU- SO ACTUALLY IT'S ON SECOND THE BILL THING THIS. THE MOVE OF IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER OFTEN OKAY SO THE MOTIONS TO PASS ITS AMENDED- TAKEN BY CENTRE RAFI- CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL EGGMAN EGGMAN AYE GONZALEZ GROVE RICARDO HURTADO AYE LEYVA. LEAVE A NOTE LEÃ“N. ROTH ROTH AYE RUBIO AYE RUBIO AYE WIENER WIENER AYE OKAY THE BILL CERTAINLY- SIX ONE AND- WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU IF YOU AND I SEE CENTER VECTORS HERE- SO LET'S MOVE NOW ON TO ITEM NUMBER TEN SB FOURTEEN NINETEEN BY CENTER FACTORS. THANK YOU A CHAIR AND MEMBERS- PERSONALLY SIX AT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS LIST ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE. ANALYSIS ONE OF THE MOST SACROSANCT RELATIONSHIPS IN OUR SOCIETIES BETWEEN A PATIENT AND A PHYSICIAN. IN SUCH A RELATIONSHIP PATIENTS CAN CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN ON PRIVATE MATTERS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND RECEIVE A FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION AND HIGH QUALITY CARE. TAILORED TO THEIR NEEDS. OVER THE SHARING OF PATIENT HEALTH INFORMATION WITHOUT SUFFICIENT PHYSICIAN CONSULTATION AND PRIVACY PROTECTIONS CAN HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT. THIS CAN HAPPEN BECAUSE FEDERAL INFORMATION BLOCKING RULES REQUIRE PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO RELEASE PATIENT DATA AS SOON AS IT'S AVAILABLE. THANK FOR THE FEDERAL RULE DIFFERS TO STATE LAW HELLO CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO BALANCE THE GOAL PROVIDING PATIENT ACCESS INFORMATION WHAT PARTICULAR PRIVACY IN A HEARING TO THEIR WISHES. THIS BILL AS A NEW PATIENT PROTECTIONS IN A CALIFORNIA LAW THAT WILSHIRE PATIENTS RECEIVE CHALLENGING HEALTH INFORMATION. IN THE TIME AND MATTER THAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM. THE BILL SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND RECEIVE NO RICHARD OPPOSITION. I THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY. VIRGIN I VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU CENTER VECTOR- WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES- WENT IN PERSON AND ONE ON THE PHONE- I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO TAKE FIRST SERVICE GOT MCDONALD HERE IN PERSON OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO ITS FIRST BEGAN WITH US SCOTT MCDONNELL- WELCOME AND THEN YOU HAVE. TWO MINUTES AND THEN- TOTAL FOUR MINUTES BETWEEN THE TWO SO YOU RUN OVER THE TWO MINUTE WARNING YOU'RE TAKING TIME AWAY FROM THE OTHER WITNESSES SO WELCOME STATUS WELCOME BACK TO THE FINALS WILL TRY T BE RESPECTFUL THANK YOU. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SCOTT MCCONNELL TIME- GENERAL INTERNIST AND CLINICAL INFORMATICS IS ONE OF THE NEWEST MEDICAL SPECIALTIES. AND I WORK AT UC DAVIS IS THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF ELECTRONIC. HEALTH RECORDS. TO TESTIFYING TO OF THIS BILL TODAY NINE. AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN I DON'T REPRESENT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS CASE- I'VE BEEN ADVOCATE FOR SHARING PATIENT MEDICAL RECORDS WITH PATIENTS FOR MANY YEARS- AND SO I KNOW HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ONE TWO THREE FIVE ONE FOUR EIGHT VERY WELL- AS I'VE BEEN. HELPING IMPLEMENT IN OUR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM FOR MANY YEARS- THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN THE MOST COMPLEX OF THE WHOLE TIME AS WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THE FEDERAL INFORMATION BLOCKING REGULATIONS AND TRYING TO MARRY THOSE AGAINST THE CALIFORNIA STATE REGULATIONS IN THIS. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE- IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE PAST YEARS THAT CODE WAS SORT OF A BARRIER TO WHAT WE COULD A RELEASE TO PATIENTS WHEN WE WANTED TO SHARE INFORMATION INCREASINGLY CALIFORNIA ORGANIZATIONS ARE LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA STATE LINE TO HELP US CAV X. EXCEPTIONS TO NOT SHARE PATIENT DATA IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL INFORMATION BLOCKING RULE AND THAT RULE IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE STRICT LATER THIS YEAR WE'RE HAVING TO SHARE EVEN MORE INFORMATION WITH PATIENTS IMMEDIATELY. FOR THREE DIFFERENT ROUTES AS WELL. SO I REALLY DO STRONGLY FEEL THAT PATIENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS DATA BUT AS PHYSICIANS ALSO HAVE A DUTY THE SACROSANCT DUTY TO PROVIDE THEM CONTEXT MEANING IN SUPPORT- ALONG WITH THAT INFORMATION CERTAINLY WHEN IT'S INFORMATION THAT'S REALLY LIFE ALTERING TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE CURRENT LAW ADDRESSES CASES OF CANCER THAT TURN UP ON ISSUES ROUTINELY PROCESSED BY THE BIOPSIES AND PAP SMEARS IN THE LAKE. IT DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS- CANCERS THAT MAY APPEAR ON AN IMAGING SCAN- IT ALSO DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS GENETIC INFORMATION THAT CAN LEAD TO- THAT IT CAN ALSO BE LIFE CHANGING FOR FAMILIES- CARRILLO WAS INITIALLY WRITTEN BACK WHEN WE HAD DIAL UP INTERNET. COMPUTERS WERE BIG BEIGE BOXES. AND NOW MOST CALIFORNIANS HAVE SUPER COMPUTERS IN THEIR POCKETS AND ALWAYS INTERNET CONNECT LIVE CONNECTIONS AND THEIR- CONNECTIONS TO THE WORLD. IN THIS TRANSFORMATION AND HEALTH RECORDS BEEN NO LESS DRAMATIC WORRIES HAVE WALLS OF PAPER CHARTS- NOW WE HAVE REAL TIME ACCESS TO OUR OWN INFORMATION ACROSS THE INTERNET. AND ABLE TO HAVE- INTERACTIONS WITH OUR PROVIDERS AND RETAIN. DIRECTLY CLOSE TO REAL TIME SOMETIMES- ALSO ELECTRONIC SECURITY AND PRIVACY IS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF WHERE IT WAS BACK IN THE NINETIES WHEN THIS BILL WAS INITIALLY WRITTEN. SO I THINK IT'S TIME TO THOROUGHLY MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS PROVIDERS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS BY A CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA LAW TO PERMIT FLEXIBILITY FOR COMMITTEE HORATIAN IN OUR SYSTEMS. MARCIN MISUNDERSTAND WE CAN COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHILE ENSURING LIFE ALTERING INFORMATION RELEASES HAPPEN IN A TIMELY FASHION BUT STILL WITH THE GUIDANCE AND THE SUPPORT OF THEIR DOCTORS.

MY NAME IS SUSAN AREN'T ALL AS I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE I'M A CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY I'M WITH THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE WE ARE BASED IN LOS ANGELES. SB TWELVE FORTY FIVE ALTHOUGH FACIALLY NEUTRAL WILL DISPARATE LEE IMPACT MINORITIES AS THE BILL ITSELF STATES IT IS HOME 228% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. BUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALREADY ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF ALL ABORTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. MOST ABORTION FACILITIES IN L. A. COUNTY ARE LOW INCOME HI MY NORTE AREAS. AND GUTMACHER INSTITUTE STATISTICS SHOW THAT BLACKS AND HISPANICS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY THAN ANY OTHER RACE OR ETHNICITY TO HAVE AN ABORTION. WE AS A NATION CAN NOT AND SHOULD NOT IGNORE RACISM IN OUR HISTORY. PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S FOUNDER MARGARET SANGER WAS AN ADMITTED QUITE SUPREMACIST. HER STATED PURPOSE WAS TO PROMOTE BIRTH CONTROL AND ABORTION FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. SAYING A REFERRED TO BLACK AMERICANS IMMIGRANTS AND INDIGENOUS AMERICANS AND I QUOTE. AS HUMAN BEINGS WHO NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN BORN. I AM NOT SAYING AND I DO NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT THE AUTHORS OF PRO ABORT BILLS TRAVELING THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE ARE RACIST OR INTENTIONALLY PROMOTING A RACIST AGENDA HOWEVER. BY PLACING MORE ABORTION FACILITIES IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SB TWELVE FORTY FIVE UNDENIABLY FOLLOWS PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S EUGENIC ROOTS MARGARET SANGER WOULD BE THRILLED.

THANK YOU RYAN AT TWO THIRTY TWO PEOPLE HAVE. FIVE TWO THREE TWO. I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SESSION THE COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIRTY GROWTH. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. M. FIRST I DO AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE FIRST OF INDIVIDUAL IN OPPOSITION THAT YOU KNOW MARKET SINGER IF WE'VE LEARNED YEARS FOR YEARS THAT SHE WAS A WHITE SUPREMACIST AND SHE DID IT SHE DID FIFTIES ABORTION CLINICS IN BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT I KNOW YOU GUYS GOING TO PASS THIS BILL UP WITH FLYING COLORS- BUT THERE'S NO LACK OF ACCESS FOR ABORTIONS IN LOS ANGELES NOR IS THEIR LACK OF ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA. THE STATE ALREADY FUNDS ABORTIONS THROUGH TAX DOLLARS THERE'S OVER FOUR HUNDRED FACILITIES PERFORMING ABORTIONS. ABORTIONS ARE OFFERED BY NURSE PRACTITIONERS NURSE MIDWIVES FUSES PHYSICIANS' ASSISTANTS VIA TELEHEALTH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND THROUGH DOZENS OF SOURCES BY MAIL. AND TO DO A PILOT PROGRAM LIKE THIS TO USE ADDITIONAL TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR A STATE RESIDENTS IS- I WOULD SAY A SLAP IN THE FACE TO CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS DOLLARS- TAXPAYERS THAT. ARE OBVIOUSLY OVERTAXED AS IT IS BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE. AND I THINK IT'S AN INEFFICIENT USE OF OUR RESOURCES NOT ONLY FOR- THE- FISCAL PEACE BUT THE MORAL GROUND PLEASE SET THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR TARO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO- I KNOW THAT THE CONVERSATION HERE TODAY AROUND THIS BILL IS LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE PORTION COMPONENT WHICH YOU KNOW I THINK OVER A WOMAN'S OVER A WOMAN'S BODY. THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD HAVE A SAY OVER HER OWN BODY. AND SECOND- THE OTHER. COMPONENTS OF THE BILL THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE IS- THE INCREASE. APPROVING ACCESS TO THE FULL SPECTRUM OF SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH I MEAN LOOK WHAT WE'RE COMING OUT OF IT PANDEMIC CRYSTAL IN ONE RIGHT AND WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE. ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOW LET ME WE HAVE AN INCREASE IN GONORRHEA AN INCREASE IN SYPHILIS WE HAVE- JUST A NEED FOR. IMPROVING ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE CARE AS WELL AND SO. I KNOW THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE ABORTION PIECE BUT WE GOT A LOOK AT IT AS A WHOLE AND I THINK THIS BILL. WILL HELP WITH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WILL BE CONTINUING TO FACE SO. I SUPPORT THE BILL AND A LITTLE BIT AT THE PROPONENT VETERAN MOVER CENTER TILE AND OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER EGGMAN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CENTER CALLING FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- AND AT. IF TO ME ON THIS ON THIS DIET HAS TRIED ACCESS TO AN ABORTION IN A- IN THE MOST RECENT HISTORY THEN I GUESS THEY COULDN'T BEGIN. WITH VERACITY CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH ACCESS EARLIER BILL TODAY WE HEARD A VERY CLEAR PROBLEM WITH ACCESS THAT SOMEBODY HAD IN LOS ANGELES- SO MUCH LET'S JUST SAY THAT. AND I APPRECIATE A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE I MEAN AS WE SAID THIS IS AN ISSUE OF CHOICE AND ACCESS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSING TO OPPOSE. ON TAKING AWAY SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHOICE SEEMS TO BE THAN IMPOSING THEIR FEELINGS ON TO OTHER PEOPLE WHICH IS AGAINST- MOST THE THINGS. PEOPLE STAND UP FOR RIGHT FRIEDMAN CHOICE SELF DETERMINATION THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WHICH THIS BILL IS TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE YOU CAN'T HAVE A SELF DETERMINATION IF THERE. IS NO ACCESS. THAT'S LIKE SAYING THAT NOBODY'S HUNGRY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE GROW ALL THIS FOOD WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. WE KNOW EVEN THOUGH WE ARE A RICH AGRICULTURAL STATE WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM FOOD INSECURITY- SO I WOULD HAVE MOVED THE BILL IF IT WASN'T- ALREADY AND I JUST I ALWAYS HEAR IN MY IN MY MIND- THE WORDS OF. FLOORS WHERE TO WHO SAID WHO SAYSJUST BECAUSE I HAD ELEVEN KIDS DOESN'T MEAN I THINK EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO I WAS MY CHOICE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A SIMILAR THIS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SO. YOUR BILL. SAYS FUNDS MAY BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AND THEN IT LISTS AT SIX DIFFERENT THINGS HERE SO IT'S THE NOT LIMITED TO PART- THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE THAT'S BASICALLY OPEN ENDED THAT MEANS THIS MONEY CAN BE SPENT ON ANYTHING THAT THE L. A. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DECIDES IS APPROPRIATE THAT PERHAPS TO TAXPAYERS MIGHT NOT SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU TALK HERE IN YOUR BILL ABOUT BUILDING SECURE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN YOU DEFINE WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT. WELL SURE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE- ATTACKS MADE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WORK IN CLINICS AND FACILITIES WHERE ABORTIONS ARE ACCESSIBLE. AND PART OF IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS ARE SAFE WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO SEEK CARE IT COULD BE A PORTION CARE IT COULD BE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ON THE SPECTRUM. SO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING THERE IS BUILDING A FACILITY- THAT IS SECURE MUCH LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE IN RIGHT NOW. IS THAT CORRECT. SO THAT WOULD BE OPEN TO YOUR POINT THAT THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND A PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOS ANGELES AND THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE PILOT PROGRAM IS GOING TO RESOLVE. OKAY COUNTERING MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT OR WELL WE KNOW I HISTORICALLY THERE ARE- THERE'S PROPAGANDA AGAINST- CLINICS THAT OFFER ABORTION CARE OR ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE DOCTORS- OF THAT PROPAGANDA OR IS IT A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW WELL IT'S MISINFORMATION IF YOU SAY THAT X. OR Y. COULD HAPPEN IF YOU GO INTO THAT CLINIC THAT IS MISINFORMATION. OKAY WELL THAT'S OPEN TO INTERPRETATION- PROVIDING MEDICALLY ACCURATE INFORMATION TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. PROVIDING MEDICALLY ACCURATE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TOOLS TO THE COMMUNITY- WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE TO YOU PROVIDING MEDICALLY ACCURATE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TOOLS TO THE COMMUNITY IT LOOKS LIKE IN A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND SENSITIVE WAY MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION RELATIVE TO HOW THEY LIVE HOW THEY LOVE HOW THEY HAVE SEX HOW THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR BODIES HOW THEY ENSURE THAT THEY ARE HEALTHY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT ALREADY. IN SOME INSTANCES WE DON'T SOME COMMUNITIES MAY HAVE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF THOSE RESOURCES OTHERS COMMUNITIES MAY NOT OR IT MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT FOR EXAMPLE. WE DO NOT HAVE CONSISTENT ACCESS TO CARE ON OUR SCHOOL CAMPUSES FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS SOME COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT EIGHT HAVE. AN ABUNDANCE OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE HIGHLY RESOURCE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN CARE OTHER DISTRICTS MAY NOT. SO YOUR BILL THEN WOULD ALLOW FUNDING TO BE FUNNELED INTO THE SCHOOLS FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING ADEQUATE EDUCATION ON ATTAINING AN ABORTION I WAS USING AN EXAMPLE. ABOUT INCONSISTENCY AS IT RELATES TO ACCESS THIS IS ABOUT A PILOT PROGRAM FOR- ABORTION ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE NOT ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS WELL BUT I GUESS IT GOES BACK TO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION BECAUSE- IN THE BILL IT'S AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO. SO THE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO- SEND- EITHER MATERIALS OR PERSONNEL ORDERED YOU KNOW TRAINING VIDEOS OR WE KNOW WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE INTO THE SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO EDUCATE. KIDS ABOUT- ABORTION OR HOW TO GET IT OR WHAT'S MEDICALLY. I MEAN RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO. WELL I MEAN I'M NOT LIMITED TO COULD INCLUDE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS LIKE CREATING MATERIALS TO TELL YOU HOW YOU CAN GO TO MARS- BUT I WOULD POSIT THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. IT COULD INCLUDE YES A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. TO LET'S GO WITH YOUR EXAMPLE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO MATERIALS THAT TALK ABOUT STDS GONORRHEA SYPHILIS WHICH IS ON THE RAIMES I CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ALSO ON THE RISE YOU KNOW THAT YOUR BILL DOESN'T TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OR SYPHILIS IT TALKS ABOUT ABORTION. IT SAYS BRING IN THE VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH OF YOUR BILL IT TALKS ABOUT- INCLUDING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO BEAR TRIED OR TO CHOOSE TO OBTAIN AN ABORTION SO THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT. STDS OR ANYTHING ELSE THIS IT WAS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ABORTION WHIPS ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ACCESS INCLUDING ABORTION I JUST A TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THESE. THE FIVE OR SIX POINTS EXCUSE ME THAT YOU HAVE ENUMERATED IN YOUR BILL YOU KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THEY MEAN I THINK YOU PROVIDE ME SOME GREAT INSIGHT TODAY AS TO WHAT YOU ENVISION THAT LOOK LIKE I JUST WANTED CLARITY. ON THAT WELL THE CALL AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR AND YOUR YOUR CANDOR AND YOUR MINISTRY. SO IT WILL INCLUDE ACCESS TO SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND SERVICES INCLUDING ABORTION I'M NOT GOING TO SHY AWAY FROM THE FACT- THAT- THIS IS ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN. IF THEY CHOOSE HAVE ACCESS TO ABORTION SERVICES THANK YOU. L. COMMENTS ARE QUESTIONS TWENTY MEMBERS. OKAY I DON'T SEE ANY ALL RIGHT- SO- SORRY FROM OTHER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I THINK- YOU TO OTHERS IN NEED TO SURE AND YEAR AND ACTUALLY IN. THE CITY THAT YOU LEAST REPRESENT FOR YOUR IN YOUR DISTRICT- THE RESOURCES TO SHOW WE HAVE EQUAL ACCESS SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT IN MY CLOTHES RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THINGS YES AND IN FACT THERE WASN'T- OPINION PIECE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES I BELIEVE IT WAS- APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WRITTEN BY ALEXIS MCGILL WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHO TALKED ABOUT. MARGARET SANGER IN- DOES NOT EXCUSE THE HISTORY- OF HER AND IN FACT SHE WAS NT AGAINST- BLACK PEOPLE AND BROWN PEOPLE SHE WAS ALSO AGAINST OTHER IMMIGRANTS POLISH AND IRISH- AND I ALSO I'M NOT EXCUSING HER I THINK SHE WAS A PRODUCT OF HER TIME. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL WOMEN OF ALL COLORS AND ETHNICITIES AND RACES ARE HAVING ABORTION. ARE GETTING ABORTIONS. EACH AND EVERY DAY. WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR BODIES AND THIS IS A BILL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO ACCESS THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED BASED ON THE CHOICES THAT THEY MAKE WHEN WE HAD COBIT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAID WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING TESTING AND VACCINATIONS TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED- FROM HAVING UNDER RESOURCE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEN WE SAW NUMBERS OF ARTICLES AND TV REPORTS OF WHITE PEOPLE. IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES IN LINE GETTING THOSE TESTS AND GETTING THOSE VACCINATION SHOTS I WOULD SAYING THAT BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHERE SOMETHING IS LOCATED PEOPLE WHO NEED THE RESOURCE WILL MAKE THEIR WAY TO THAT FACILITY. I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT ALTERNATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S NOT SO MUCH IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO CARE. AND IT IS ALSO BEING VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY WOMEN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND FROM STATES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE MAKING THEIR WAY TO CALIFORNIA. TO FIND ACCESS TO CARE THAT IS BEING DENIED IN THEIR STATE. AFGHAN REFUGEES ASSAULTED AND RAPED BY THE TALIBAN WHO FIND THEIR WAY TO TEXAS PREGNANT WANTING AN ABORTION. ARE MAKING THEIR WAY TO CALIFORNIA. LATINA IMMIGRANTS LIVING ON THE BORDER IN TEXAS NOT ABLE TO ACCESS ABORTION CARE BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF CLINICS AND PHYSICIANS AND SAFE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE ARE MAKING THEIR WAY TO CALIFORNIA TO RECEIVE RESOURCES IF WE ARE GOING TO UPHOLD. THE DECLARATION OF THE GOVERNOR THAT SAYS THIS WILL BE A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN OWN UP TO THAT DECLARATION BY MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS WITH IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT THEY DESERVE AND WANT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT THROWING THEM ARE MARGINALIZING THEM BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO WORKING VERY HARD TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN EACH AND EVERY DAY WHO ARE DESPERATELY FINDING THEIR WAY. HERE AT THE END OF THE DAY. REGARDLESS OF IF YOU PASS THIS BILL OR NOT PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SEX. WE WILL CONTINUE TO GET PREGNANT PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THEIR BODY AND PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ABORTIONS. WE CAN CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE FOLKS ARE HAVING ILLEGAL UNSAFE DEADLY FATAL ABORTIONS OR WE CAN CREATE A SPACE WHERE WOMEN DO NOT HAVE TO DIE.
