00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:25.143
INCREASE IS DUE TO THE SUBSIDIES --

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.309
AND THOSE THAT UNSUBSIDIZED

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:13.177
PREMIUM RANGE VARIES.

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:15.379
BASED ON REGION AND ALSO BASED

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:17.415
ON AIDS EVEN THOUGH THE

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:18.916
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LIMITED HOW

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:20.818
MUCH PREMIUMS CAN VERY BASED ON

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.386
AGE OLDER PEOPLE --

00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:24.288
IS STILL CAN PAY UP TO THREE

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:27.125
TIMES MORE THAN THE YOUNGEST

00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:32.063
PEOPLE.

00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:34.532
SO WITH THE SUBSIDIES TO COVER

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:36.234
CALIFORNIA AND THE OTHER

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.302
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROTECTIONS

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:40.338
IN THE MEDI CAL EXPANSION --

00:35:40.404 --> 00:35:42.073
WE'VE SEEN AN INSURANCE DROP

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:43.608
SIGNIFICANTLY --

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:46.344
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.112
THE END THAT'S DUE TO

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:49.146
CALIFORNIA'S EFFECTIVE

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.882
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:52.550
CARE ACT AND ALSO THE STEPS THE

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:55.820
STATE HAS TAKEN --

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:57.421
TO HELP PROTECT THAT PROGRESS IN

00:35:57.488 --> 00:36:00.525
THE FACE OF A FEDERAL TEAMS AS

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:02.360
SO WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AN

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.661
INSURANCE RATE FOR THE NON

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:06.330
ELDERLY IN CALIFORNIA DROP FROM

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:09.166
AROUND SEVENTEEN POINT 6% BEFORE

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:11.168
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. TO TEN

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:14.672
POINT 4% IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:16.440
THAT AN INSURANCE RATE COULD

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:18.843
START CREEPING BACK UP --

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.945
TO TWELVE OR 13% IN THE NEXT FEW

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:23.214
YEARS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:25.883
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:33.424
BEINGS THERE ABOUT.

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.960
SO WE PROJECT THAT IN TWENTY

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.361
TWENTY FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:38.930
COULD BE UNINSURED WITHOUT

00:36:38.996 --> 00:36:40.765
FURTHER STATE ACTION AND THAT

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:42.066
COULD GROW TO FOUR POINT FOUR

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.635
MILLION BY.

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:45.336
TWENTY TWENTY THREE OF THOSE

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:46.571
FOUR MILLION UNINSURED

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:48.539
UNDOCUMENTED MAKE UP THE LARGEST

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:51.108
GROUP BUT THE NEXT LARGEST GROUP

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:53.444
IS THE MAIN APPROXIMATELY ONE

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:54.679
MILLION CALIFORNIANS I'VE

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:55.846
HIGHLIGHTED HERE.

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:58.249
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COVERED

00:36:58.316 --> 00:37:00.284
CALIFORNIA IT BUT WOULD NOT BE

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:02.119
ENROLLED UNDER OUR PROJECTIONS

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:03.821
AND HALF OF THEM?

00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:05.656
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:08.426
UNDER THE ACA AND HALF WOULD NOT --

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:17.068
BE ELIGIBLE DUE TO THEIR INCOME

00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:17.368
[inaudible]

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:18.769
IN.

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:21.205
AS SO THIS THIS AS DAVID JUST

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:23.374
SHOWS THAT THOSE WHO WOULD BE

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:24.942
UNANSWERED IN ELIGIBLE FOR

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.143
COVERED CALIFORNIA OR SPREAD

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:30.481
ACROSS A RANGE OF INCOME LEVELS --

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:32.650
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AS THE

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.752
REASONS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:36.454
ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE CALIFORNIA

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.823
REMAIN UNANSWERED --

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:39.824
IT.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:40.725
THE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:42.760
INTERVIEW SURVEY DATA SHOWS THAT

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.428
COST AS THE TOP REASON FOR

00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:46.230
LACKING INSURANCE AMONG THIS

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:46.897
GROUP.

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:49.200
AND THAT'S TRUE REGARDLESS OF

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:49.734
WHICH INCOME LEVEL YOU'RE

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:57.475
LOOKING AT SO AFFORDABILITY

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.710
CONCERNS NOT ONLY PERSIST FOR

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:01.979
THOSE WHO REMAIN UNANSWERED.

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:03.781
BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO FOR SOME

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:05.683
OF THOSE WHO HAVE ENROLLED IN

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.084
THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET.

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:08.853
AS THIS IS A FROM A SURVEY

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:10.421
CONDUCTED BY RESEARCHERS AT

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:12.590
HARVARD AMONG CALIFORNIA

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:15.793
INDIVIDUAL MARKET ROWLEY'S AND

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.728
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND AMONG

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:19.497
INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES

00:38:19.563 --> 00:38:21.599
ROUGHLY FOUR OUT OF TEN REPORTED

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.934
SOME OR A LOT OF DIFFICULTY AND

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:25.503
AFFORDING PREMIUMS.

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:27.438
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.306
TRENDS ARE ARE RELATIVELY

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:32.743
SIMILAR ACROSS INCOME LEVELS.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.445
ABOUT THREE OUT OF TEN

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.713
INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.049
REPORTED A DIFFICULTY WITH OUT

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.517
OF POCKET COSTS WITH THE

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.452
SLIGHTLY SMALLER SHARE OF THE

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.054
HIGHER INCOME --

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.389
AMONG THIS GROUP REPORTING THOSE

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:52.296
DIFFICULTIES.

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:53.964
SO THESE AFFORDABILITY

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:56.300
CHALLENGES CAN HAVE CONSEQUENCES

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.269
OF COURSE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE AN

00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:59.003
ROLES.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.171
FIRST -- THE

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:02.807
SAME SURVEY SHOWED THAT --

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:05.543
OF INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES.

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:07.878
WHO NEEDED CARE REPORTED THAT

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:09.947
THEY EITHER DELAYED OR DID NOT

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:12.450
GET CARE DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:14.118
COST?

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:16.087
A ALMOST A THIRD OF INDIVIDUAL

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:18.956
MARKET ENROLLEES IN --

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:19.824
TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORTED SOME

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.560
KIND OF FINANCIAL STRESS RELATED

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:25.129
TO THE COST OF CARE AS SOME

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:27.298
BORROWED MONEY TO PAY FOR CARE

00:39:27.364 --> 00:39:29.500
SOME CUT OTHER NECESSITIES LIKE

00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:31.736
FOOD OR HOUSING TO PAY FOR CARE.

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:33.170
AND SOME.

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:35.272
EXPERIENCED BOTH TYPES OF

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:42.279
FINANCIAL STRESS.

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:44.381
SO I WANT TO FOCUS FOR A MINUTE

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.484
JUST ON THE AFFORDABILITY

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.052
CHALLENGES FOR THOSE WHO ARE

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.820
ELIGIBLE FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:50.921
SUBSIDIES.

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:53.290
THIS GRAPH SHOWS.

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:55.192
HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:56.260
PAY UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:58.028
ACT ON PREMIUMS AS A SHARE OF

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.230
INCOME?

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:01.365
WHICH RANGES FROM AROUND 2% OF

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:02.600
INCOME AT THE LOWEST INCOME

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:05.503
LEVELS TO ALMOST 10% AT THE

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:06.670
HIGHER INCOME LEVELS --

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.339
WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH OUT

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:10.674
OF POCKET COSTS SOME PEOPLE WITH

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.643
TYPICAL HEALTHCARE USE CAN SPEND

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.645
MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR INCOME ON

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:15.980
HEALTHCARE COSTS?

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:17.248
AND PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST

00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:19.717
LEVEL OF MEDICAL USE CAN SPEND

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:23.154
UP 22230% OF INCOME ON

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.922
HEALTHCARE COSTS. TO TAKE ONE

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.124
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE AS SINGLE

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.527
PERSON EARNING THIRTY THOUSAND

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:30.728
DOLLARS WHICH IS.

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.463
ABOUT FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.764
FOR SOMEONE WORKING FULL TIME SO

00:40:33.831 --> 00:40:35.800
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.268
THE STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:39.069
SOMEONE EARNING THIRTY THOUSAND

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.571
DOLLARS WOULD PAY TWO HUNDRED

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:41.739
DOLLARS PER MONTH.

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:42.373
ON PREMIUMS --

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:46.110
FOR THE SEX OVER PLAN WHICH IS

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.745
THE THE BENCHMARK PLAN.

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:50.147
AND DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW HOW

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:51.015
MUCH THEY'RE PAYING FOR VINCE

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:52.583
AND WHETHER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.553
ARE THAT COULD BE CHALLENGING

00:40:55.619 --> 00:41:00.291
FOR SOMEONE AT THAT INCOME LEVEL.

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:01.458
SO THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:04.028
EXAMPLE OF THE A COUPLE.

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:06.764
AND WHO EARNS A LITTLE TOO MUCH

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:07.698
FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:12.136
SUBSIDIES SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE IT

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:13.070
TO FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLDS LIVING

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:16.273
IN SAN MATTEO AND EARNING ABOUT

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:16.907
SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:17.775
YEAR.

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:20.044
THIS COUPLE WOULD PAY A COMBINED

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.713
TOTAL OF OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.781
DOLLARS A MONTH IN PREMIUMS

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:25.616
THAT'S MORE THAN 20% OF THEIR

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:27.952
INCOME JUST ON PREMIUMS.

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:29.587
ON TOP OF THAT THEY'D HAVE TO

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:31.922
PAY THE FULL COST FOR ANY HEALTH

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.591
CARE THEY USE.

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:35.826
A IT ED BEYOND THE FIRST THREE

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.394
OUTPATIENT VISITS WHICH THEY

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:38.395
COULD THEY COULD GET WITH A

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:40.531
COPAY BUT BEYOND THAT THEY'D

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:41.832
HAVE TO PAY THE FULL COST OF

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:44.101
CARE UP TO THE SIXTY THREE

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:47.538
HUNDRED DOLLAR ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLE --

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:49.506
THAT APPLIES TO EACH OF THEM.

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:51.208
AT THE END SO THIS EXAMPLE IS

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:53.978
REALLY TO ILLUSTRATE THAT THE

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:54.812
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:55.913
AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.383
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE ABOVE 4100%

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.150
OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL

00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:03.487
WHERE THE ECA CLIFF ENDS ARE IS.

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:05.756
A AND ALSO ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:08.626
INDIVIDUALS WHO FACE HIGHER

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:10.327
PREMIUMS.

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:12.062
ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS EXAMPLE

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:13.998
IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:15.466
ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES ARE NOT

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:18.102
PROTECTED FROM THE RISING THE

00:42:18.168 --> 00:42:21.372
RAPIDLY RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS.

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:23.274
OF THE WITCHER PROBLEM ACROSS

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.809
OUR ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM --

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:28.345
BUT ALSO THE FACT TO A

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:40.724
INDIVIDUALS AT LIKE THIS EXAMPLE.

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:42.126
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD MENTION

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:43.994
IN INTRODUCTION THE HIGH COST OF

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:44.862
LIVING IN THE STATE.

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:45.763
ADDS TO THE AFFORDABILITY

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.164
CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE FACE WITH

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:47.765
HEALTHCARE WITH THE HIGH COST

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:50.567
THE MONEY LEFT OVER IN THEIR

00:42:50.634 --> 00:42:52.202
HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS --

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:53.804
FOR HEALTH CARE AFTER PAYING FOR

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:55.472
RENT IN CHILD CARE AND OTHER

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:57.408
EXPENSES --

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:59.009
IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:01.912
PREMIUM ASSISTANCE DOES NOT TAKE

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:03.747
INTO ACCOUNT COST OF LIVING.

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:05.849
AND WE ESTIMATE THAT FOUR TIMES

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:07.351
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHICH

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:09.086
IS THE UPPER INCOME LIMIT FOR

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:10.921
PREMIUM SUBSIDIES --

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:13.257
IS EQUIVALENT TO FIVE TIMES THAT

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:15.426
LEVEL ACROSS THE STATE AND SIX

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:18.095
TIMES THAT LEVEL AND A HIGH COST

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:19.530
REGION LIKE SAN FRANCISCO.

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:22.366
AND SO MORE ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED.

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.535
AT THE LOWER INCOME LEVELS AND

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:26.804
ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED UP TO A

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:31.275
HIGHER INCOME LEVELS.

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:33.644
SO TO SUM UP WE WE'VE MADE

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:35.546
SUBSTANTIAL GAINS IN CALIFORNIA

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:36.880
BOTH IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.615
MARKET ENROLLMENT LEVELS AND

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.384
AFFORDABILITY.

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.786
BUT THERE ARE MULTIFACETED --

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:44.555
CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN IN TERMS

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:46.623
OF AFFORDABILITY NOT ONLY FOR

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.393
THAT INST UNINSURED BUT ALSO FOR

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.694
THOSE WHO HAVE INSURANCE IN THE

00:43:50.761 --> 00:43:52.896
INDIVIDUAL MARKET --

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:54.331
FOR BOTH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:56.233
ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR AFFORDABLE

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.402
CARE ACT SUBSIDIES AND FOR

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.070
MIDDLE CLASS CONSUMERS WHO ARE

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:01.939
INTO MUCH ESPECIALLY OLDER

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.507
INDIVIDUALS.

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:04.742
AND TO THE AFFORDABILITY

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.243
CONCERNS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.045
PREMIUMS BUT ALSO OUT OF POCKET

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:09.213
COSTS.

00:44:09.279 --> 00:44:10.814
AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:13.350
CHALLENGES ARE AND NOT ONLY AN

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:16.120
INSURANCE BUT ALSO AND CAN

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:19.923
CREATE BARRIERS TO CARE AND

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.058
FINANCIAL AND SECURITY.

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:22.059
AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:22.693
IMPORTANT THE DISCUSSION WE'RE

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.228

50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:06.804

00:45:16.613 --> 00:45:17.614
REGIONALLY UNDER THE AFFORDABLE

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:18.215
CARE ACT --

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.921
GOVERNMENT --

AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.058
ENDED FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.726
THAT MECHANISM BUT WHAT THE

00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:31.195
STATE HAS DONE --

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.496
IT IT IS --

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:35.399
INSTRUCTED INSURERS --

TO CONTINUE TO PRIDE THAT THAT

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.669
COST SHARING ASSISTANCE BUT THE

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:40.904
COST OF THAT IS THEN ADDED TO

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:43.040

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.611
AND SINCE.

00:45:47.678 --> 00:45:48.979
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:50.180
ARE ENROLLING IN THE SILVER

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:51.615
PLANS TO COVER CALIFORNIA

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:54.051
RECEIVINGPREMIUM SUBSIDIES.

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:56.019
THE COST IS ULTIMATELY PAID VIA

00:45:56.086 --> 00:46:00.457
THE THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU.

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.892
AND I'M YOU KNOW THIS NUMBER WAS

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:03.327
SEEN BEFORE IN IT SO IT IT IT IS

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:03.927
A LITTLE MIND BOGGLING TO ME

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:04.728
STILL.

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.230
THAT WE STILL HAVE NEARLY A

00:46:06.296 --> 00:46:08.098
MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:09.633
FOR MEDICARE OUT THAT DON'T TAKE

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.069
ADVANTAGE OF IT --

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:13.871
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:16.306
WE HOW WE HOW WE CLOSE THAT GAP

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:17.174
YEAH.

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:19.510
AND IT IT IS A LARGE NUMBER AND

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.011
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:23.313
MORE INVESTIGATION INTO WHY

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.517
THEY'RE UNINSURED I MEAN --

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.485
TO EXPLANATIONS ARE SOME OF THE

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:29.920
MAY NOT REALIZE THERE AND THEN

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:31.855
SHARED A OTHERS.

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:34.391
MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ENROLLING OR

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:35.926
MAYBE UNANSWERED FOR SHORT

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:38.829
PERIODS OF TIME --

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:41.431
TO I THINK A WE SHOULD CONTINUES

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:44.101
INTO THE STRONG EFFORTS. TO TO

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.469
MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW WHETHER

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:47.004
ELIGIBLE FOR AND TO HELP THEM

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.472
AND RULE --

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:51.108
AND ALSO LOOK IT EFFORTS --

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:52.976
TO ENROLL PEOPLE IN IN MORE

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:54.545
AUTOMATIC WAYS WHEN THEY'RE

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:55.879
ENROLLED IN OTHER PUBLIC

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.915
PROGRAMS THAT AND INDICATE THAT

00:46:57.981 --> 00:46:59.883
THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL OR

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.885
WHEN THEY UNDERGO A CERTAIN LIFE

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:03.487
TRANSITIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:09.259
LIKELY TO ALSO EXPERIENCE A A

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:13.197
CHANGE IN HEALTH INSURANCE.

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:16.033
OTHER QUESTIONS RIGHT SO I HAVE

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:17.000
A COUPLE --

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.435
SO FOR FIRST OF ALL I AGAIN

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:18.969
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:19.469
PRESENTATION --

00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:23.974
IN IN TERMS OF WE'VE WE POINTED

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:24.274
I THINK --

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:24.875
SAID -- DOC

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:26.210
WOULD POINTED OUT WE HAVE

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:27.778
MILLION PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI

00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:29.513
CAL -- TO

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.582
AREN'T SIGNED UP WE ALSO.

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:32.616
KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:33.584
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THIS

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.919
CLIFF AT 4100% OF A THIRD PARTY

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.055
LEVEL BUT I ALSO NOTE THAT --

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:40.123
WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.858
THOUSAND YOU DO GET SUBSIDIES --

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:46.863
WHO HAVEN'T SIGNED UP EITHER --

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:47.898
SO MAYBE IT'S THE SAME ANSWER

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:50.033
BUT DO YOU WANT TO MAYBE THINK --

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.435
SPECULATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:52.169
THAT --

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:53.670
INVITATIONS THEY SPECULATE IF

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:54.538
THE DANNY DATA THAT'S OUT THERE

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:57.040
ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT AND

00:47:57.107 --> 00:47:57.274
IS IT --

00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:58.642
LACK A YOU KNOW THAT THESE

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.677
HEARING OUT OF THE MANDATE THAT

00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:03.447
MIGHT BE ARE OF WHAT WHAT ARE

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:04.781
SOME WELL ACTUALLY.

00:48:04.848 --> 00:48:07.484
WHAT WERE SOME THE THINGS THAT --

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:08.952
WE MIGHT DO TO ENGAGE --

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:11.455
THOSE THOSE FOLKS SURE SO FOR

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.290
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:13.790
FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:15.492
SUBSIDIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:18.195
SURVEY DATA AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:20.264
REMAIN ENROLLED ARE ASKED WHY DO

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.065
YOU REMAIN IN THE ROLE OF THE

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:24.368
COST IS DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:26.470
THREE WE DO PROJECTED THAT GROUP.

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:27.638
WILL GROW --

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:29.172
WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:32.242
PENALTY BEING ELIMINATED --

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:35.245
BUT AS FOR MANY THE THE

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:37.581
SUBSIDIES JUST ARE NOT ENOUGH --

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:40.917
AND AND AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:41.952
DO WITH COST OF LIVING AND

00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:45.455
FINANCIAL AND SECURITY AND NOT

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:46.857
HAVING THAT THE ROOM AND THEIR

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:49.993
FAMILIES BUDGETS TO TO PAY FOR

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.762
THOSE PREMIUMS --

00:48:51.828 --> 00:48:52.462
WOULD YOU SAY THAT IS PEOPLE ARE

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:54.197
GENERALLY HEALTHIER AND PERHAPS

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.733
USE HEALTH CARE SERVICES LESS

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.470
THAN PEOPLE WHO SIGN UP --

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:02.139
I'D I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR OUR

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.674
EXACT ESTIMATES ON THAT BIT

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.108
THERE CERTAINLY ARE PEOPLE WHO

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:06.977
REALLY NEED THE CARE AND MAY

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.712
HAVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS WHO ARE

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.847
AMONG THE UNINSURED --

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:13.917
AND AND SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN

00:49:13.984 --> 00:49:15.018
ASSUME THAT.

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:17.621
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING WITHOUT

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:20.357
INSURANCE --

00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:24.294
I DON'T NEED IT --

00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:28.198
OKAY AND AS FAR AS YEAH SO WHAT

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:29.366
ACTUALLY THE OTHER QUESTION I

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:29.900
HAD WAS --

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:32.736
OR DO YOU HAVE A TABLE WHERE YOU

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:35.939
LOOKED AT WE SURVEYED PEOPLE

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:41.111
ABOUT THE FIND THAT TABLE HERE --

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:43.980
EVERY PEOPLE ABOUT THE UPPER.

00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:45.582
PASSED THE THAT SEE HERE --

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:49.353
YES I THINK IT'S THE ONE ON PAGE --

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:50.287
EIGHT WHERE YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:51.588
PEOPLE SAYING THEY HAVE A

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:53.056
CHALLENGES WITH --

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:53.657
DIFFICULTY PAYING HEALTHCARE

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:54.458
COSTS.

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:57.594
AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT --

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:58.528
SO WE HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO GET

00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:01.365
THE SUBSIDIES THE TWO HUNDRED

00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:01.998
FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED AND THE FOUR

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.467
HUNDRED PLUS --

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:05.235
IN THOSE NUMBERS ARE AT LEAST

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:09.139
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IT'S NOT SO --

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:10.374
NOW WITHFOR CZ FOUR HUNDRED

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.274
PLUS THE CHALLENGES IS THAT IF

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:13.810
YOU'RE AT 8100% YOU MIGHT NOT BE

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:14.978
FEELING AS MUCH AS IF YOU'RE

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:16.179
CLOSER TO FORM SOME JUST ONE IN

00:50:16.246 --> 00:50:17.981
TERMS OF THE CLIFF THE FACT.

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:21.785
AND AND AND WITH THAT --

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:26.289
IN TERMS OF A SLIDE IN TERMS OF

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:27.457
THE SURVEY DATA I I KNOW WHAT

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:28.458
THERE'S A WAY SOMEONE ACTUALLY

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:29.626
DRILLED INTO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:31.161
CLOSER TO FOUR HUNDRED PLUS WHO

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:31.361
ARE.

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:33.196
CLOSER TO FOUR HUNDRED WHEN YOU

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:34.297
SEE FOUR HUNDRED PLUS VERSUS

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:36.066
PEOPLE WHO MAY BE MUCH FARTHER

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:38.168
AWAY FROM FOUR HUNDRED WHETHER.

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:39.035
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST OVER

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:41.104
THE BRINK --

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:42.639
WITH -- THAT

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.307
THEY WOULD PARTICULARLY HAVE A

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:46.810
GREATER CONCERNS ARE ISSUES WITH

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:47.878
THAT GETTING THE COVERAGE SINCE

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.546
THEY HAVE NO SUBSIDIES SO I KNOW

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:50.714
THERE'S A WAY TO LOOK AT THAT

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.315
SELL INSURANCE TERMS OF THIS

00:50:52.382 --> 00:50:53.984
FOUR HUNDRED PLUS EXACTLY HOW

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.585
FAR OUT YOU'RE TALKING FROM.

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:56.987
FOUR HUNDRED RATE AT SO THIS WAS

00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:58.054
A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY

00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:00.157
RESEARCHERS AT HARVARD AND AND

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:02.659
MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL --

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.027
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:06.129
THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THEM MORE

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:08.465
SPECIFICALLY IT GROUPS ABOUT

00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:09.833
4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.168
LEVEL BUT THIS.

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:13.970
IS THESE RESULTS WOULD INCLUDE

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:17.240
ALL INCOME LEVELS ABOVE A 4100%

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:18.575
OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:20.510
AND I GUESS ONE OTHER QUESTION

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:22.345
AND AND I NOTICED --

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:23.346
WOULD BE IS TO CERTAIN EXTENT WE

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:24.681
WERE SET CERTAIN STANDARDS RIGHT

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.183
FOR SUBSIDIES BASED ON A

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:27.984
PERCENTAGE OF INCOME THROUGH THE

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:34.090
ACA ETCETERA --

00:51:34.157 --> 00:51:36.126
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:38.128
THAT ONE TWENTY ON YOU THE WIND

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.396
SU HI HOW LOW JUST LINE HAVE TO

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:40.030
BE.

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:41.598
AT WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY WELL

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:42.466
YOU KNOW THE HEALTH CARE AND WE

00:51:42.532 --> 00:51:43.400
CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S TOO

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:44.835
EXPENSIVE AND ALL THAT BUT

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:46.803
CERTAIN POINT LIKE WHAT POINT DO

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.071
YOU SAY THAT --

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:48.672
THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU SHOULD

00:51:48.738 --> 00:51:50.941
EXPECT TO PUT IN YOUR INCOME TO

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:52.108
COVER HEALTH CARE --

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:53.043
I MEAN SOME PEOPLE SAY SHOULD BE

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:54.778
ZERO BUT I THINK --

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:57.013
BUT AT THE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.916
SAY WELL PEOPLE SHOULD BE

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:01.284
EXPECTED BASICALLY SOMETHING

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:02.185
INTO IT.

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:04.054
SO AT AT ANY SENSE OF WORD

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.355
INFLECTION POINT IS.

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:07.357
IT'S A REALLY GOOD IN HARD

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.159
QUESTION --

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:10.961
THE I THINK THE GENERAL

00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:12.963
STRUCTURE THAT THE AFFORDABLE

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:14.865
CARE ACT HAS SET UP IN TERMS OF

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:17.200
PEOPLE PAYING AS AS A SLIDING

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:18.969
SCALE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME.

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:21.338
IS IS A GOOD ONE AND I ALSO.

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:22.672
YOU KNOW THE RECOGNITION THAT

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.407
PEOPLE AT LOWER INCOME LEVELS

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:26.243
CAN AFFORD LESS IN TERMS OF OUT

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.411
OF POCKET COSTS BUT THE EXACT

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:32.282
LEVELS ARE ARE NOT AFFORDABLE

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:33.583
ENOUGH YET --

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:34.317
I I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:37.220
GOING TO BE ONE PERFECT STANDARD

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:39.456
OF BECAUSE OFFICE OF LIVING

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:40.657
VARIES EVEN WITHIN THE STATE AND

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:42.092
BETWEEN FAMILIES EVEN IN THE

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:43.793
SAME REGION BASED ON THE VARIETY

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.262
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:48.832
AS BUT I THINK AS LONG AS WE'RE

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.433
SEEING -- A

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.935
HIGH NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:54.738
PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE REASON

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.439
FOR THAT THEY NOT SIGNED UP IS

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:57.841
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT.

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:58.942
THAT WE STILL HAVE AN

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:00.477
AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM IN AS LONG

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:02.178
AS WE SEE PEOPLE REPORTING TO

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:03.146
SURVEYS THAT.

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:04.614
THEY'RE NOT ACCESSING CARE THEY

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.349
NEED BECAUSE THE OUT OF POCKET

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:07.784
COSTS ARE TOO HIGH I THINK IT'S

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.352
AN INDICATOR THAT WE STILL HAVE

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:10.921
A PROBLEM SO --

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:13.490
A I GUESS THE ANSWER IS I THINK

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:15.258
YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:17.327
TRIAL AND ERROR TO SEAMANS WE'VE

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:19.429
IF WE MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND SEE

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:20.764
IS THAT ENOUGH THEM BECAUSE

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.065
PEOPLE DO VALUE.

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:23.633
HEALTH CARE AND WANT TO BE

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.603
HEALTHY AND WHEN WHEN COST IS

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:31.675
NOT A BARRIER --

00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:33.877
I THINK THEY WILL IN WRONG.

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:36.012
OKAY ALL RIGHT --

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:39.349
SIMILAR FRAZIER.

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:41.151
CAN WE GO BACK TO THE SLIDE WORK

00:53:41.217 --> 00:53:53.496
SHOW THE THE ELDERLY --

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:55.031
YEAH SO WE HAVE THIRTEEN SIXTY

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:56.433
TWO A MONTH --

00:53:56.499 --> 00:54:00.704
IN THE U..

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:05.675
WELL OVER.

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:06.242
FIFTY FIVE SO THAT'S THAT'S

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:11.147
REALLY.

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:13.383
THE WORD ELDERLY.

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:14.718
SO.

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:17.454
THE DEFINITION I GUESS --

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.423
SO. THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO PER MONTH.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.325
THE LOOK AT A TOTAL OF COPAYS UP

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:22.892
TO SIXTY THREE HUNDRED WHICH

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:23.560
GOES TO ABOUT.

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:24.194
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND CHANGE

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.129
STORY.

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:26.763
TWO THOUSAND SIX FORTY FOUR AND

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:27.330
IF THEY MADE SEVENTY FOUR

00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:28.865
THOUSAND WERE 30% TAX BRACKET

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:31.568
YOU KNOW THE THINGS NINE TO

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:32.168
FIFTY ONE THOUSAND SO THE NET

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:32.769
ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:54:32.836 --> 00:54:33.169
YEAR.

00:54:33.236 --> 00:54:34.337
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:35.905
SO WHAT'S AFFORDABLE ABOUT THAT

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:37.741
YEAH THATTHAT'S WHY THIS GROUP

00:54:37.807 --> 00:54:40.877
REALLY NEEDS HELP --

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.646
IN THIS IS THAT IT WAS A FAIR

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:45.281
FOR EVERYBODY RIGHT THIS IS THE

00:54:45.348 --> 00:54:46.750
AT A IS NOT THE EVEN THE WORST

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:48.318
CASE EXAMPLE THIS IS A FIFTY

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:49.352
FIVE YEAR OLD COUPLE NOT A SIXTY

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:58.495
FOUR YEAR OLD COUPLE BUT THIS.

00:54:58.561 --> 00:54:59.629
YEAH I THINK I THINK THIS

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:01.097
DEMONSTRATES THE REASON WHY WHY

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:02.198
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POLICY

00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:04.401
OPTIONS TODAY TO IMPROVE

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.670
AFFORDABILITY FOR THIS GREAT.

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:11.041
YEAH ROSE INCOME VERSES.

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:13.643
ACTUALLY THAT WORSE IS THE CO

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.011
PAYS AND ALL OF OUT OF POCKET

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:18.948
EXPENSES AS INCLUDE PHARMACY HAS

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:23.653
A AS THE IF THE SIXTY THREE

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.321
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:27.490
THAT DOES I BELIEVE.

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:29.526
THAT DOES INCLUDE PHARMACY

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:29.826
[inaudible]

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:33.029
SO.

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:37.667
I GOT WORKABLE AND A HUNDRED YOU

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:38.668
KNOW THAT HAS SOME KIND A

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:41.905
MEDICAL BENEFITS BECAUSE I WOULD

00:55:41.971 --> 00:55:42.405
NEVER BE ABLE FOR THAT.

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:51.281
YEAH.

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:54.384
YES ARE CENTERED RAZA --

00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:55.185
I'M SORRY FIVE YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:56.486
MISSED THIS I MIGHT HAVE MISSED

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:57.520
THIS BUT WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:58.588
ANY DO YOU KNOW.

00:55:58.655 --> 00:56:00.123
ABOUT -- THE

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.357
NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:04.494
EMPLOYER COVERED HEALTH CARE.

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.930
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THE COST.

00:56:06.996 --> 00:56:08.398
ON EVERYONE ELSE MY

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:10.333
UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S IT'S

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.568
DECREASED.

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:12.368
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:14.471
ABOUT THAT.

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:15.705
IMPACT.

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:17.640
OVER ONE EVERYBODY --

00:56:17.707 --> 00:56:18.241
WELL IF YOU THINGS ABOUT THE

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.242
COMPARISON BETWEEN EMPLOYER

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.043
SPONSORED INSURANCE AN

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.244
INDIVIDUAL MARKET COVERAGE I

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.746
THINK IS YOUR QUESTION.

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:26.316
AS TAKE UP RATES ARE HIGHER FOR

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:27.984
EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE --

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:34.858
THE AT BUT LET ME LET ME THINK

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:35.959
ABOUT HOW TO SIMPLY SAY THIS

00:56:36.025 --> 00:56:37.460
THERE THERE HAS BEEN RESEARCH

00:56:37.527 --> 00:56:40.263
COMPARING FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.198
BUT SHARE OF THE MARKET PAYS

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:43.900
MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR INCOME ON

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:44.667
PREMIUMS.

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:47.270
AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET

00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:49.172
THAT'S A MUCH HIGHER SHARE

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.907
PAYING THAT HIGH COST BURDEN ON

00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:52.709
PREMIUMS THAN AN EMPLOYER

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:54.077
SPONSORED INSURANCE.

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:56.146
AND THEN ON THE OUT OF POCKET

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:59.482
COSTS SIDE OF THE THE

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:00.750
COMMONWEALTH FUND.

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:04.220
MEASURES UNDER INSURANCE OR OR

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.121
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:08.658
THAT COVER THEIR THEIR FINANCIAL

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.593
RISK WHEN THEY NEED CARE AND

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.462
UNDER INSURANCE IS MORE OF AN

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:26.195
EIGHTEEN A PRECIPITOUS DROP IN

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:26.829
ENROLLMENT.

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:27.630
THEY IN ESSENCE HAD ALREADY

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:32.034
PRICED OUT THE PEOPLE OF A ON IN

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.636
THIS LAST OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.772
THEY SAW AN ADDITIONAL 16% DROP --

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:38.474
WE IN CALIFORNIA SAW A BIGGER

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.276
DROP THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:41.510
LOT OF HEALTHY PEOPLE.

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:42.979
OUR CHALLENGES THE STATE IS TO

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:43.913
MAKE SURE WE DON'T FOLLOW IN THE

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.414
FOOTSTEPS OF OTHER STATES THAT

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.649
ARE PRICED --

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.184
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SUBSIDIZED

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.952
AND THAT ARE NOT SICK OUT OF

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:51.988
COVERAGE --

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:52.521
THAT'S WE SEEN REST OF THE

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:53.756
NATION.

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.024
WHAT DID WE SEE IN TERMS OF WHO

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:57.026
DID NOT SIGN UP WE DID ANALYSIS

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:59.028
BACKWARDS UPSIDE DOWN SIDEWAYS

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:00.963
AND FOUND A COUPLE THINGS --

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.565
FIRST SOME OF THE THEORIES OF

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.267
WHO MIGHT NOT IN ROLE DIDN'T

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.935
TURN OUT TO BE TRUE IT WASN'T

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.603
MORE LIKELY TO NOT A ROLE IF YOU

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:08.304
WERE YOUNGER.

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:09.505
IT TURNS OUT THAT --

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.140
YOUNG INVINCIBLE SO TO SPEAK OR

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:13.242
NOT YOUNG AND STUPID --

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:15.211
THEY ACTUALLY SIGNED UP IN OR

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.679
DROP COVERAGE OF THE SIMILAR.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.848
AS OTHER GROUPS OF THE TWO

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:21.784
GROUPS THAT WE SAW SUBSTANTIALLY

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:23.219
HIGHER.

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:24.220
DROPS IN ENROLLMENT WE'RE NUMBER

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.388
ONE PEOPLE TO SIGN UP FOR BRONZE

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.089
PLANS WHICH IS A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:29.625
PLANS WHICH WE HAVE SEEN.

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:31.060
BEING HEALTHIER POPULATION

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.862
GENERALLY PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY BY

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.563
THE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN --

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.165
THAT CAUSES GREAT CONCERN THE

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:37.800
OTHER IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.702
DROPS OF UNSUBSIDIZED

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:40.536
INDIVIDUALS --

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:42.505
NOT A SURPRISE BUT A A TROUBLING

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:43.239
NOTE.

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:44.640
THE OTHER THING WE DID SEE IS

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.642
SOME HIGH --

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.711
ENROLLMENT FROM NON ENGLISH

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.880
SPEAKERS SPANISH SPEAKERS KOREAN

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:51.981
CHINESE --

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.549
WE DON'T THINK THAT'S A FACTOR

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.483
FROM THE PENALTY --

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.718
WE THINK THAT'S A RELATED A

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.420
PUBLIC CHARGE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:59.422
QUESTIONS ON THAT LATER.

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:01.190
WE DID ABSOLUTELY SEE THOUGH

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.425
THAT THE REMOVAL OF THE PENALTY

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.060
BECAUSE PREMIUMS TO GO UP --

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.028
WE HAD AN EIGHT POINT 7% AVERAGE

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:07.330
PREMIUM INCREASE --

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:09.699
ABOUT HALF OF THAT WAS BECAUSE

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.100
SPECIFICALLY OF HEALTH PLANS

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:14.070
PRICING FOR THEIR EXPECTATION.

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.104
THAT THERE WOULD BE A DROP OF

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:17.440
ENROLLMENT AND HEALTHIER PEOPLE

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:18.307
WOULD DROP.

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:20.042
THEY ALL SAID AND WE NEGOTIATE

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:22.011
VERY ACT WITH OUR PLANS --

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.046
WE WANTED THEM TO PRICE RIGHT WE

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:25.948
DON'T UNDER PRICED OR OVERPRICED --

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.283
BUT THEY NOTED THAT THAT WAS THE

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.384
FIRST STEP DEPENDING ON WHAT

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:29.585
HAPPENS THEY WOULD BE NEEDED TO

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.487
LOOK AT THEIR PRICING FOR TWO

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:33.189
THOUSAND AND TWENTY AND TWENTY

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.724
ONE IN ROMAN GOES DOWN MORE NEXT

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.459
YEAR YOU'LL SEE A BIGGER PREMIUM

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:37.693
INCREASE.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.095
JUST BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH MIX

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:40.996
SO THAT'S WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:45.434
AND NINETEEN NEXT.

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:48.537

THAT THE PATH TO AFFORDABILITY.

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:26.709

POVERTY --

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:48.190

SPEND A MOMENT --

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.241
WITH THE TAKE AWAYS OF THIS IS --

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:41.610

THE BIGGEST EFFECT ON ENROLLMENT --

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.086

NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:57.159
BOTH NOD STE TO BUY COVERAGE AND

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.028
BECAUSE PREMIUMS WE LOWER WOULD

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:00.729
HAVE BY FAR THE LARGEST EFFECT

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:03.365
ON INCREASING ROLE.

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:05.834
OF THE OTHERS HAVE A BUILDING

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:06.669

IN TARGET DIFFERENT PEOPLE

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:09.471

POVERTY.

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.843
REMEMBER BELOW 40% OF POVERTY

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.912

ABOVE 40% THEY'RE GETTING

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:22.585
NOTHING.

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.119
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:24.987
BELOW 4% SO THAT THAT'S THE

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.455
TRADE OFF OF THE REPORT GOES

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:27.723
THROUGH.

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:30.759
SO -- I

PAGE THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY THREE

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.569
SPELL THESE OUT WITH A NUMBER OF

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:21.937
HYPOTHETICAL PEOPLE THEY REALLY

LOW COST AREA AND IT'S VERY

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:35.384
IMPORTANT IN A CALIFORNIA.

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:37.186
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:39.488
GENERALLY COST 30% MORE FOR

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.157
CALIFORNIA.

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:42.424
SO -- NOW

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:44.693
THAT'S A REALLY BIG ISSUE OTHER

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.627
DOCTOR WOULD YOUR NOTE ABOUT

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:48.030
COST CONTAINMENT WRIT LARGE IS A

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.331
VERY IMPORTANT MIND AT ALL OF US.

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:50.466
IT'S THE REALITY OUR CONSUMERS

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:55.304

THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL HE

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.776
GETS --

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.544
QUITE A BIT OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT --

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:04.913
HIS PREMIUM FOR THE SECOND

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.716
LOWEST SILVER PLAN IS THREE

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:09.218
FIFTY DOLLARS BUT HE ONLY PAID A

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:10.119
HUNDRED THIRTY SIX DOLLARS.

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:11.887
BUT IF YOU'RE MAKING TWENTY FIVE

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:12.588
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:14.423
PAYING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.258
DOLLARS CAN BE STEEP --

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:17.693
UNDER THE OPTION TO OF THE

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.761
COMPREHENSIVE WHICH IS THE

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:20.195
OPTION WITHOUT REINSURANCE WE

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:21.430
JUST PICK ONE IS A STRONG AND

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.766
WITHOUT GIVING YOU EIGHT HUNDRED

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:26.235
ROSE -- UPON

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:27.336
SO WE GET MORE FINANCIAL HELP

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:29.004
STILL SPENDING FORTY DOLLARS A

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.372
MONTH FOR THE SAME COVERAGE AND

01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:32.074
IT WOULD BE THAN 2% OF HIS

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.476
INCOME INSTEAD OF 7% SIX AND A

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:36.478
HALF PERCENT.

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.880
COULD MAKE SOME SENSE.

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:40.015
NEXT MODEL LET'S TAKE IT TO

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.483
AARON FRANCIS ON SIXTY TWO YEARS

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.184
OLD -- THEY

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.052
MAKE.

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:45.053
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT ABOVE

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.289
40% OF POVERTY NOT A LOT BUT A

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:48.690
GOOD BIT ABOVE I'M NOT NO ONE

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:51.426
WOULD SAY SOMEONE MAKING SEVENTY

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:52.427
FIVE THOUSAND IS A POOR PERSON.

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.996
NOW YOU LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO OR

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:55.731
TRYING TO RENT A HOUSE IT'S A

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:58.500
CHALLENGE BUT TO SEPARATE SO

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.269
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ABOUT 40%

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:00.502
POVERTY.

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:03.772
ON TO AFFORD.

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:04.373
A SECOND LOW SILVER PLAN IT

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:06.108
WOULD COST THEM TWO THOUSAND TWO

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.643
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:08.644
MONTH.

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:09.745
OKAY -- THAT

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:12.381
PLAN WOULD MEAN IT WOULD TAKE

01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:14.249
36% OF THEIR INCOME FOR THE

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:15.717
PREMIUM ALONE.

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:16.585
NOT INCLUDING THEIR OUT OF

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:19.121
POCKET COSTS THEN GETTING A

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.522
SILVER PLAN MEETING OUT OF

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.558
POCKET WOULD COVER MOST OF THEIR

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:23.625
HEALTHCARE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:24.226
PAY.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.727
OUT OF POCKET FOR A LOT BUT THEY

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:26.562
MIGHT HAVE.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:31.567
TO BUT JUST PREMIUM. 36% OTHER

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:31.733
IN.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.636
UP YET AS MISTER FRAZIER NOTED --

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:35.370
IT'S HARD TO CALL IT AFFORDABLE --

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.805
TO THAT FAMILY AND THERE ARE

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.340
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES LIKE THAT

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.609
IN PARTICULAR IN NORTHERN

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:43.846
CALIFORNIA IN ABOVE.

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:44.880
FRESNO ONE NORTH --

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:47.316
HAVING PREMIUM SUPPORT THAT GOES

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:48.350
ABOVE THAT.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.651
MIGHT MEAN DEPEND ON WHAT THE

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:51.854
LEVELS OF THESE ARE THEY STILL

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.622
BE PAYING SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS --

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.090
BUT IT WOULD MAKE IT FAR MORE

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:57.359
AFFORDABLE FOR THEM HAVING 9% OF

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:58.360
THEIR INCOME GOING TOWARDS

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.795
HEALTHCARE AND DOCTOR PAN YOUR

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:01.396
QUESTION WHAT'S THE RIGHT LEVEL.

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:02.664
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A MAGIC

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:04.299
ANSWER FOR THAT.

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:06.435
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAD A

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.804
GREAT DATED A GREEDY ASIANS ON

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:10.772
INCOME THAT STARTED AT BASICALLY

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:13.976
2% AND WHAT UP 29%. FOR PEOPLE

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.878
AT 40% OF POVERTY BUT THEN IT

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.680
WAS ZERO ABOVE 40% --

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.449
IT DOES MAKE SENSE TELL PEOPLE

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:21.884
EARN MORE HAVE A HIGHER

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.785
PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME.

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.387
THEY HAVE MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME --

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:28.190
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO FROM 9%

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:31.793
236% BY THE FACT OF A CLIFF --

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.129
THAT WAS A PROBLEM OF THE RITUAL

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.198
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IT'S LOOKING

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:39.701
AT TODAY --

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:40.836
LAST I WANT TO JUST VERY BRIEFLY

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:42.504
SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE OPTIONS

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:43.906
TO MAKE SURE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND.

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.274
THE COMMON PATIENTS THAT ARE

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.476
DESIGNED WE HAVE AND THE TWO

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.111
ELEMENTS ONLY UNDERSTAND IS --

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.946
YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT DEDUCTIBLES --

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:52.547
I'D REMIND YOU THAT FOR

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:54.216
EVERYTHING THAT SHADED IN BLUE

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:56.418
IS NOT SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE.

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:58.186
WHICH MEANS THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:15:58.253 --> 01:15:59.788
PEOPLE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:01.390
BOTH WITH COVER CALIFORNIA AND

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.025
THE BY DIRECTOR THEIR PLANS.

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.893
WHEN THEY GET A SILVER PLAN KNOW

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.662
OUTPATIENT SERVICES ARE SUBJECT

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:07.462
TO A DEDUCTIBLE?

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:08.931
BUT THAT STANDARD SILVER PLAN

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:12.200
MEANS YOU GO TO A PRIMARY CARE

01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:12.768
DOCTOR YOU'RE SPENDING FORTY

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:13.535
DOLLARS.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:14.569
IF YOU'RE LOWER INCOME FORTY

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:15.771
DOLLARS A LOT OF MONEY.

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:17.439
WHICH IS WHY THE COST SHARING

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.974
REDUCTION PLANS.

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:20.242
ARE SO IMPORTANT.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.144
AND DEPENDING ON YOUR INCOME YOU

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.779
WON'T SPEND FORTY DOLLARS TO SEE

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.914
A DOCTOR IF YOU'RE QUITE LOW

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:27.516
INCOME AT ABOUT A 150% OF

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:29.051
POVERTY IT'S FIVE DOLLARS IF YOU

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:31.019
MAKE MORE MAYBE IT'S THIRTY FIVE

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.621
OR FIFTEEN BUT THAT'S JUST TO

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:33.722
MAKE REAL THIS WHOLE COST

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:34.756
SHARING REDUCTION.

01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:36.091
SUBSIDIES IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:38.160
THING FOR THE PLANS IT IS NOT

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:38.994
FOR THE HEALTH PLANS.

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:42.965

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.099
MAKES IT AFFORDABLE SO IF YOU

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:45.167

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:49.838
DOLLARS A YEAR AND YOU'RE TOLD.

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:52.741
DOLLARS TO SEE A DOCTOR MANY

01:16:58.547 --> 01:16:59.348
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO THE DOCTOR

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.616
MORE SO THAT'S THAT'S OF THE

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.919
COST YOUR MCAT MECHANICS WERE --

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.587
LAST I WOULD JUST NOTE IN IN

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:06.788
CLOSE AND I LOOK FORWARD YOUR

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:07.856
QUESTIONS IS --

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.024
I DO THINK THAT --

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.759
IT'S NOT OUR JOB TO SAY WHICH IS

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.294
THE RIGHT.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.528
YOU KNOW PIECES TO PUT TOGETHER

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:14.930
HERE BUT I DO THINK THE

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:16.865
LEGISLATION THE GOVERNOR HAVE A

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:19.234
RIGHT BY THINKING OF PAIRING

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:20.635
PENALTIES AND SUBSIDIES.

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:21.737
THE ISSUES OF BEHAVIORAL

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:24.940
ECONOMICS NOBEL PRIZE TO

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:25.240
TAILORED --

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.141
CHICAGO.

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:27.743
A KNOWLEDGE MAKES SENSE A

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.411
KNOWLEDGE OF WORKS --

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.812
EVERYONE TO PAY MORE IN THE

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:32.247
ABSENCE OF THE PENALTY.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:33.915
ALSO PEOPLE ABOVE THE CLIP ON

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.751
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LEFT

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.519
THEM OUT AND IT'S AN ISSUE

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:39.388
THAT'S A CHALLENGING TENS OF

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:41.623
THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS --

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:42.791
THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:46.461
NOTE IS THAT MANY PEOPLE.

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:48.130
STILL WOULD NOT GET SUBSIDIES.

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:49.664
BUT BY HAVING A WORKING

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.199
INDIVIDUAL MARKET THAT HAS LOWER

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:52.834
PREMIUM INCREASES EVEN PEOPLE

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:54.936
THAT SUBSIDIES WILL BE ABLE TO

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.038
BUY AND STILL WILL BE BLIND SO

01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:58.040
IT BENEFITS EVEN PEOPLE HAVING

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:59.274
THE A PENALTY.

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.809
PEOPLE THE DOCKET SUBSIDIES WILL

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:02.878
BE PAYING LOWER PREMIUMS WITHOUT

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:04.112
SUBSIDIES BECAUSE THE PREMIUMS

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:05.847
GOING DOWN FROM HEALTHY RESPECTS.

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:07.149
SO WE ARE DONE --

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:08.417
WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:09.885
OUR WORK AT COVER CALIFORNIA IN

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.720
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOOK FOR

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:15.424
YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:21.163

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:23.732
FINANCE.

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:24.733
WELL I I THINK THAT MISTER LEE

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.501
AND THIS WAS THE DEFINITELY SET

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:27.135
THE STAGE FOR THIS DISCUSSION

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:27.803
TODAY SO I WON'T TAKE TOO MUCH

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:28.937
TIME.

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:29.371
TO DISCUSS --

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:32.107
THE FACTORS LEADING THE

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:34.209
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL --

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:35.710
BUT VERY VERY SORRY INTERJECT

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:37.279
AND HAD A QUESTION IT'S AN

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.680
APPROPRIATE TO ASK AT AT THE

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:40.215
GENERAL THAT PREVIOUSLY SPOKE

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.049
WITH THAT BE OKAY BEFORE WE MOVE

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:43.151
FORWARD ADDRESS IF WE CAN JUST

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:45.854
TWO QUESTIONS AT THE AFTER OKAY

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:46.555
THANK SOMEONE.

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:53.028
THINK YOU ALL ACROSS THE STATE.

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.262
BUT YEAH VERY BRIEFLY --

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:55.263
UNDER THE ACA CALIFORNIA MADE

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.364
SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN REDUCING

01:18:56.431 --> 01:18:57.833
THE UNINSURED RATE.

01:18:57.899 --> 01:18:59.701
AND THEN --

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:02.804
SLOWING THE GROWTH OF PREMIUMS --

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:04.706
AND YOU KNOW IT IN AND WHILE

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.041
IT'S DIFFICULT I THINK TO TO

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:08.143
SORT OF TEASE OUT EXACTLY WHAT

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:10.278
FACTORS THAT WOULD BE AS A

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:11.813
RESULT OF THE LOSS OF THE

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.582
MANDATE VERSUS OTHER THINGS THAT

01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:14.249
ARE HAPPENING IN THE HEALTHCARE

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:15.484
MARKET.

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:17.185
I THINK IT'S GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.054
THAT THE LOSS OF THE FEDERAL

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:21.389
MANDATE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:23.492
THE RATE OF THE UNINSURED --

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:24.860
IN SO THE ADMINISTRATION

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.995
PROPOSES --

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.363
TO REINSTATE THE MANDATE AT THE

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:33.768
STATE LEVEL BEGINNING IN --

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.203
TWENTY TWENTY THE MANDATE --

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.304
WOULD BE MODELED OFF OF THE

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.240
FEDERAL PENALTY WHICH IS EITHER

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:39.841
A FLAT AMOUNT OR A SHARE OF

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:41.543
INCOME MOST PEOPLE PAY THE FLAT

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.812
AMOUNT WHICH IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:46.414
WAS EQUAL. TO SIX HUNDRED NINETY

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:47.482
FIVE DOLLARS PER ADULT PLAN

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:48.717
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:49.784
DOLLARS PER CHILD UP TO A

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.120
MAXIMUM.

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:52.687
OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:54.756
DOLLARS --

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.158
WE EXPECTED THE MANDATE WILL

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:57.626
GENERATE ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED

01:19:57.692 --> 01:19:59.327
MILLION DOLLARS IN PENALTY

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.496
REVENUE WHICH WE DEDICATE. TO

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:03.398
PROVIDING SUBSIDIES --

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:06.401
IF YOU'RE COVERED CALIFORNIA --

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.637
SO RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:10.005

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.506
IN THIS HEARING --

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.008
BOTH FOR THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:14.809
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:16.845
BUT ALSO THOSE WHO --

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:18.813
HAVE INCOMES ABOVE THE THE CLIFF

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.515
THAT MISTER LEE DESCRIBED --

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:22.350
THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:24.419
MAKE THOSE SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE --

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:27.455

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.771
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:44.806
BUT AGAIN GOING TO THAT SORT OF

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:46.741

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.118
EXTENT.

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:38.353
OF THE IMPACT OF A STATE

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.821
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS UNCERTAIN

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.823
IT MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:44.092
EFFECTIVE TOOLS THE STATE HAS TO

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:46.161
INCREASE ENROLLMENT --

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.962

01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:50.098
THE COST OF OF COVERAGE IN THE

PROJECTIONS AND SHOW THAT A

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:57.539
STATE INDIVIDUAL ANDATE COULD

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:58.973
RESULT IN.

NEARLY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:01.810
THOUSAND ADDITIONAL --

PEOPLE ENROLLING IN COVERAGE AND

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:05.146
THAT --

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:06.681
ESTATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE COULD

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:08.850
ALSO LEAD TO A AVERAGE REDUCTION

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.418
IN MONTHLY PREMIUMS OF ABOUT

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.253

EFFECTS COMPARED WITH.

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:19.928
MOST OF THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:21.429

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.431
CALIFORNIA REPORT.

AND AT THE SAME TIME ESTATE

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:26.167
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:29.471
GENERATE REVENUES FOR THE STATE --

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:31.005
THESE WOULD LIKELY BE OFFSET TO

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:32.807
SOME DEGREE BY INCREASE STATE

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:34.809
COSTS AND MEDI CAL BECAUSE AS

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.411
HAS BEEN MENTIONED NOT EVERYONE

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.413
AND THAT'S ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.147
IS ENROLLED IN IT'S EXPECTED

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.515
THAT -- WITH

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.717
THE END OF THE FEDERAL PENALTY --

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:44.152
SOME --

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:44.986
PEOPLE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:46.354
MEDICARE WILL WILL LOSE THAT

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:47.722
WILL DROP THAT COVERAGE --

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:50.091
AND A STATE MANDATE WOULD

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:50.925
ENCOURAGE.

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:52.727
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO SEEK OUT AND

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.362
AND MAINTAIN THAT COVERAGE BUT

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:56.431
EVEN WITH THOSE OFFSETTING COSTS

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:57.899
AND A STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.000
IS IS VERY LIKELY --

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:00.702
COST EFFECTIVE --

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:01.636
APPROACH FOR THE STATE TO

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:02.904
CONSIDER FROM A STATE BUDGET

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:05.039
PERSPECTIVE.

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:06.608
THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:08.643
TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH STATE

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.711
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE --

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:12.213
COSTS OUTSIDE THE STATE BUDGET

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.915
IN PARTICULAR THE INDIVIDUAL

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.784
MANDATE WOULD RESULT IN SOME

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:17.952
INDIVIDUALS APPERSON COVERAGE

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:18.553
WHERE THEY ARE OTHERWISE WOULD

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.854
NOT HAVE --

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:21.756
ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:23.925
HAVING THAT COVERAGE --

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:26.928
BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY GENERATE

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:28.663
REVENUES FOR THE STATE AT THE

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:31.232
EXPENSE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:33.101
CHOOSE TO CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:34.302
COVERAGE --

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:35.837
PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DON'T VIEW

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:38.039
THE OPTIONS AS AFFORDABLE.

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:41.776
IN LIGHT OF THESE COSTS AND

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:42.544
SORRY IF I GET TO THAT ON

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:46.080
BALANCE AND CONSIDERING THE THE

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:47.849
DIFFERENT FACTORS A PLAY WE WE

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:48.950
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:51.186
GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:52.053
TO AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.488
PROPOSAL TO ENACT AN INDIVIDUAL

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:54.823
MANDATE.

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.357
BUT IN LIGHT OF THE COST THAT AN

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:57.659
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD IMPOSE

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:59.894
ON SOME HOUSEHOLDS WE DO MAKE WE

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:01.496
DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE.

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:02.263
AFTER THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:03.998
CONSIDER AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:05.567
IN CONJUNCTION WITH --

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:08.036
ADDITIONAL POLICIES THAT WOULD --

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:10.972
IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY.

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:11.372
I'M.

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:13.341
AS BEEN MENTIONED AT THIS POINT

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.009
RELATIVELY FEW DETAILS HAVE BEEN

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.211
RELEASED --

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:17.712
SO FAR ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:18.880
THE SUBSIDIES --

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.982
BUT IF THEY WOULD BE FUNDED FROM

01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:22.250
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:25:22.317 --> 01:25:23.218
DOLLARS ROUGHLY THE AMOUNT

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:24.719
ESTIMATED TO BE GENERATED BY THE

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.187
PENALTY.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:27.121
THEY WOULD BE RELATIVELY MODEST --

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:29.757
AND COMPARES THESE WHICH ARE

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:32.727
ESTIMATED TO BE OVER SIX BILLION

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.162
DOLLARS IN.

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.996
TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAVING SAID THEY

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:35.897
WOULD -- YOU

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.866
KNOW EASE COMPLIANCE WITH THE

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:39.534
STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE --

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:40.702
MAN AND THEREFORE WORTH

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:41.970
CONSIDERING --

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:42.904
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.405
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER --

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:45.273
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.841
SUBSIDIES IN THE CONTEXT OF AN

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:48.042
ARRAY OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:49.544
INCLUDING THOSE.

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:50.812
AT REFERENCE IN THE COVER

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.614
CALIFORNIA REPORT AND AND

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.782
DETERMINE WHICH SET OFPOLICIES

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:55.617
WOULD BEST A LINE WITH THE

01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:57.185
LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES.

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:59.220
AND DESIRES FOR FOR BUDGETARY

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:01.723
COMMITMENT --

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:05.994
WITH THAT I WILL MOVE ON TO SOME

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.061
COMMENTS ABOUT.

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:09.297
SOME POSSIBLE FUNDING SOURCES

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.266
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE.

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:14.802
AND TO PAY FOR POLICIES INTENDED

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:16.304
TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY.

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:18.606
BEGINNING ON PAGE.

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:21.075
FOUR AND THE HAND OUT LIST HAS

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:22.277
SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:23.411
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:25.480
KEEP IN MIND. FOR USING

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:26.481
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:28.983
REVENUES.

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:31.686
THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT THE

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:34.656
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE HAS A POLICY

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:37.659
GOAL OF ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.827
TAKE A COVERAGE OR CONVERSELY

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:40.995
DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM GOING

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:43.398
WITHOUT COVERAGE.

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:45.733
AND AND THIS POLICY GOAL IS AT

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.903
ODDS WITH A SECONDARY GOAL OF

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:50.872
CREATING REVENUES TO PAY FOR FOR

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.340
SUBSIDIES --

01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:52.807
IN OTHER WORDS IF THE

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:56.611
LEGISLATURE WERE THE POLICY GOAL

01:26:56.678 --> 01:26:58.146
THAT WOULD MEAN --

01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:59.514
LEADING TO AS FEW PEOPLE AS

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:01.649
POSSIBLE AT GOING WITHOUT

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:02.951
COVERAGE AND PAYING THE PENALTY

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:04.686
BUT THIS THEN WOULD RESULT IN.

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:05.987
LESS REVENUE AVAILABLE TO PAY

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.089
FOR THE SUBSIDIES.

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:09.490
ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:10.892
WITH AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:12.126
PENALTY.

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:14.796
IS TIMING AT REVENUES FROM A

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:16.431
STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY --

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:18.266
IF IT WAS MODELED ON THE FEDERAL

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:19.701
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE --

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:21.703
WOULD BE COLLECTED IN THE MONTHS

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:22.770
FOLLOWING THE YEARTHAT IT WAS

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.639
FIRST IMPLEMENTED THROUGH TAX

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:25.540
RETURNS.

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:27.609
AND IF THE LEGISLATURE WHICH TO

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.010
USE THOSE FUNDS TO COVER

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.179
SUBSIDIES BUT ALSO WISH TO MAKE

01:27:31.245 --> 01:27:32.647
THE SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE AT THE

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.015
SAME TIME THAT THE PENALTY WHEN

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:34.916
TO AFFECT.

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:36.651
IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:38.019
SOME UP FRONT FUNDING ON A ONE

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.254
TIME BASIS TO COVER THE FIRST

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:43.024
YEAR OF SUBSIDIES.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:48.763
TURNING TO PAGE --

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.798
FIVE AND THE HAND OUT --

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:52.100
ANOTHER.

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:54.535
POTENTIAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR

01:27:54.602 --> 01:27:56.237
AFFORDABILITY POLICIES IS.

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:57.939
A RENEWED AT MANAGED CARE

01:27:58.006 --> 01:28:01.376
ORGANIZATION OR MCO TAX PACKAGE.

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.211
BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AND THE

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:04.812
STATE CURRENTLY LEVEES ATTACKS

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:06.280
ON MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS OR

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:07.582
NCOS.

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:08.249
THAT ALLOWS THE STATE TO

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:09.984
LEVERAGE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:11.686
FUNDING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:12.754
AS PART OF THE CURRENT MCO TAX

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:16.124
PACKAGE THIS TAX REDUCTIONS TO

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:17.525
CERTAIN INSURERS.

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:19.293
TAKEN ALL TOGETHER THIS RESULTS

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.062
IN A NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT OF

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.930
ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:24.799
DOLLARS EACH YEAR.

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:27.068
THE CURRENT NCO TAX PACKAGE IS

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:29.337
GOVERNED BY STATE LAW AND ALSO

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:30.972
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROVALS.

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:32.707
AND IS SCHEDULED TO SUNSET AT

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:34.809
THE END OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:36.477
NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR.

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:38.046
THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT PROPOSED TO

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:40.348
EXTEND THE MCO TAX PACKAGE AS

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:41.916
PART OF HIS BUDGET.

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:43.418
HOWEVER RECENT FEDERAL APPROVAL

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:46.354
OF SIMILAR INSURANCE INSURANCE

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:47.989
TAX -- AT

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:50.825
POLICIES AND OTHER STATES AND

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:52.026
MEAN THAT IT'S LIKELY THAT THE

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:53.695
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD APPROVE --

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:55.363
A RENEWAL OF CALIFORNIA'S MCO

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:56.998
TAX.

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.833
IF THE STATE WERE TO RENEW THE

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.835
MCO TAX PACKAGE.

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:01.636
AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS WOULD

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:03.671
GENERATE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS OF

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:05.707
BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:08.743
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN --

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:09.277
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:10.545
POTENTIALLY AROUND ONE POINT

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:12.380
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:13.514
LATER YEARS.

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:15.783
AND THESE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.785
FREED UP RESOURCES COULD BE USED

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:18.953
TO FIND VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:19.787
PRIORITIES.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:25.093
INCLUDING AFFORDABILITY POLICIES.

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:27.628
TURNING TO PAGE SIX TIME WE

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:28.329
DISCUSS SOME.

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:29.897
CONSIDERATIONS FOR USING A

01:29:29.964 --> 01:29:32.500
SUGARY DRINKS TAX --

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:34.936
FIRST CONSIDERATION FOR A SUGARY

01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:36.304
DRINK TAXES THAT SIMILAR TO THE

01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:37.972
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE SUCH ATTACKS

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.073
WOULD HAVE --

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.110
BOTH A POLICY AND A FISCAL GOAL.

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:43.478
AT THE POSSIBLE THE SUGARY DRINK

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:44.746
TAX WOULD BE TO REDUCE

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:46.848
CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY BEVERAGES

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:49.550
AND POTENTIALLY LEAD TO IMPROVED

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:50.384
HEALTH.

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:51.486
AND THE FISCAL GOAL WOULD BE TO

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:54.522
RAISE REVENUES HE'S [inaudible]

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:59.527
AND AS WE NOTED IN A RECENT

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:00.895
REPORT -- ON

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.063
THIS SUBJECT IMPLEMENTING A

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.898
SUGARY DRINK TAX WOULD --

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:05.166
REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.802
SEVERAL KEY DESIGN DECISIONS --

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:09.804
SOME OF THESE DECISIONS INCLUDE

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.172
AT WHAT TYPES OF DRINKS TO

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.540
INCLUDE.

01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:14.208
IN THE BASE OF THE TAX --

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:17.512
WHETHER THAT TAX BASE WOULD AND

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:19.514
BE RELATED TO THE VOLUME OF

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:20.782
DRINK OR THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:22.183
THAT'S IN.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.452
THE DRINK OR SOMETHING ELSE AND

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:25.920
WHAT THE TAX RATE ON THIS WOULD

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:28.356
BE.

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:29.891
AND FINALLY LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.359
MANDATE PENALTY A SUGARY DRINKS

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:33.594
FISCAL GOAL OF RAISING REVENUE

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.163
COULD CONFLICT WITH THE POLICY

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:36.798
GOAL.

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:39.634
OF REDUCING CONSUMPTION --

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.835
A SUGARY BEVERAGE TAX COULD

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:42.370
POTENTIALLY DECLINE OVER TIME

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.405
SIMILAR TO SOME OTHER EXCISE

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:46.007
TAXES LIKE THE TOBACCO TAX.

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:47.375
AND IN THIS COULD CREATE A

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:49.443
MISMATCH BETWEEN THE REVENUES

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.846
GENERATED BY THE TAX AND THE

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:53.915
COST OF THE SUBSIDIES THAT.

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:57.985
THE TAXES INTENDED TO SUPPORT.

01:30:58.052 --> 01:30:59.587
ON PAGE.

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:00.321
SEVEN WE NOTE THAT THE

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:01.823
LEGISLATURE COULD USE EXISTING

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.191
GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:04.592
SUPPORT AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:05.893
BUT OF COURSE THIS WOULD REQUIRE

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.762
DIVERTING FUNDS.

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:09.197
FROM OTHER ON GOING --

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:10.531
PRIORITIES.

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:11.933
ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:13.835
COULD MAKE CHANGES TO INCREASE

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:16.504
REVENUES TO THE GENERAL FUND --

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:17.805
AS WE KNOW IT IN THE HAND OUT TO

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:20.241
HAVE THE THREE MAIN SOURCES OF

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:21.075
REVENUE FOR THE GENERAL FUND

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:23.077
INCLUDE THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.780
SALES AND USE TAX.

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:27.915
AND THE CORPORATION TAX.

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:29.851
ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO CONSIDER

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:31.385
WOULD BE TO DEPOSIT THE REVENUES

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:33.521
FROM ANOTHER REVENUE SOURCE SUCH

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:34.989
AS INDIVIDUAL.

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:36.457
MANDATE PENALTY OR SUGARY DRINKS

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:39.093
TAX INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.728
THEN USE THE GENERAL FUND. TO

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:43.531
SUPPORT THE AFFORDABILITY POLICY.

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:44.165
THIS WOULD HAVE AND THE

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:46.534
ADVANTAGE.

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:48.569
AND AVOIDING THE CONFLICT

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:50.972
BETWEEN AND THE THAT THE

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:52.707
MISMATCH BETWEEN THE REVENUES

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:54.342
COMING IN AND THE COSTS OF OF

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:56.744
THE POLICY.

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:57.311
AND IT WOULD ALSO GIVE THE

01:31:57.378 --> 01:31:59.146
LEGISLATURE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:01.616
THE DESIGN OF THE AFFORDABILITY

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:04.652
POLICY.

01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:09.190
LASTLY ON PAGE AIDS --

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:10.424
WE PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON THE

01:32:10.491 --> 01:32:12.193
POSSIBILITY OF USING POTENTIAL

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.228
FUTURE SAVINGS FROM INCREASED

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:15.863
EFFICIENCY.

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.765
IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:20.635
AND TO PAY FOR AFFORDABILITY

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:21.569
POLICIES.

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:23.204
AN AS IS BEEN NOTED IN RECENT

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:24.405
YEARS A LEGISLATURE AMONG OTHERS

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:26.040
HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:27.241
UNDERLYING COST.

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:30.244
AND EFFICIENCY AND ACCESS IN THE

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.846
STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:34.248
AND AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.182
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PACKAGE

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:38.119
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED --

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:40.254
TO MULTI YEAR EFFORTS INTENDED

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.890
TO EXPLORE AND ISSUES RELATED TO

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.058
THESE CONCERNS THE FIRST IS THE

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:46.327
HAVE FUNDING TO PLAN AND DEVELOP

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:47.662
A DATABASE THAT WOULD COLLECT

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:49.864
INFORMATION ON HEALTHCARE COSTS

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:50.998
AND UTILIZATION.

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:52.500
AND THE SECOND IS THE CREATION

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:54.168
OF A COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:56.604
DELIVERY SYSTEMS WHICH IS TASKED

01:32:56.671 --> 01:32:57.204
WITH PROVIDING THE LGISLATURE

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:58.039
WITH.

01:32:58.105 --> 01:32:59.807
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MORE

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:01.542
STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO THE

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:03.311
STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.079
THESE EFFORTS WILL TAKE TIME --

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:06.380
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:07.648
EFFICIENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED IT

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:09.684
IS POSSIBLE THAT AT SOME POINT

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.385
THE STATE COULD HAVE REDUCE

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:12.119
COSTS.

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:14.922
AND FOR HEALTH CARE INCLUDING

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:17.725
FOR HEALTH PROGRAM.

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.427
AND THE SAVINGS COULD --

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.362
BE USED --

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.097
TO FIND A VARIETY OF POLICIES.

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.598
HOWEVER THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:26.167
OF ANY POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.002
SUCH EFFICIENCIES ARE.

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:29.470
ARE VERY ANSWERED.

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:31.439
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:32.940
FOR THIS PANEL AND I'D ALSO

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:34.308
HAPPY HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:36.010
QUESTIONS ALSO NOTE THAT --

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:37.111
I HAVE SEVERAL COLLEAGUES HERE

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:37.712
FROM THE LA --

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:38.479
THEY HAVE MORE DETAILED

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:39.947
EXPERTISE AND SOME OF THE ITEMS

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:40.715
THAT WE'VE.

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:41.882
REVIEWED AS PART OF THESE

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:42.950
COMMENTS AND THEY'RE ALSO

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:45.086
AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY DETAILED

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:46.387
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE.

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.621
GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:50.524
VERY IMPORTANT PRESENTATIONS AND

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:52.193
WILL ALASKA ARE MY COLLEAGUES

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:54.095
WERE --

01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:54.395
QUESTIONS --

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:56.731
SENATOR RUBIO.

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:57.698
THANK YOU AND THIS WAS FOR THE

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:58.799
PREVIOUS GENTLEMEN --

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:00.301
I THINK I HEARD YOU I READ THE

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:02.103
THE REPORT AND YOU NOTED THE

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:04.572
DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT. FOR NON

01:34:04.638 --> 01:34:06.173
ENGLISH SPEAKERS AND I JUST

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.241
WANNA KNOW THERE'S I HAVE

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:08.676
SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO ONE IS

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:09.910
THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.512
DROP IN ENROLLMENT AND THE

01:34:11.579 --> 01:34:13.147
OUTREACH EFFORTS TO THOSE.

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:17.418
COMMUNITIES AND IS THERE ANY

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:21.155
PARIS AND DOLLARS SPENT OUT OUT

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.757
REACH PREVIOUS YEARS TEN NOW.

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.692
AND THIRD HOW DO WE PLAN TO

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:25.259
IMPROVE THOSE EFFORTS MOVING

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:28.162
FORWARD.

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.763
GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE

01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:30.231
QUESTION BUT ABSOLUTELY NO

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:31.232
CORRELATION OF CHANGES NOT REACH

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:33.234
WE HAVE FOR MANY YEARS BEEN VERY

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.403
INVESTED IN WE DO --

01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:38.672
PAID ADS IN LANGUAGE IN KOREAN

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:40.141
AND SPANISH IN --

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:41.075
CHINESE --

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:43.010
IN OTHER LANGUAGES WE DO --

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:44.712
MEDIA WORK IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:47.348
OUR HYPOTHESIS ON WHY WAS THERE

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:48.983
A DROP IN IN LANGUAGE.

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:50.418
IS CONCERNS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:52.953
ABOUT THE PUBLIC CHARGE PROPOSED

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.488
REGULATIONS THE FEDERAL LEVEL --

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:55.790
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRAVEL IN

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.224
THE STATE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:59.360
TALKING TO REPORTERS.

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:01.729
IN CHINESE TRANSLATED UP A VERY

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.030
GOOD CHINESE SPEAKER --

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:04.832
YEAH OTHERS SPEAKING IN SPANISH

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:07.535
AND AND KOREAN AND WAS QUITE

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.203
ANSWERING THE THAT.

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:10.337
I WAS ASKED RECENTLY ABOUT

01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:10.971
PUBLIC CHARGE I WAS NEVER ASKED

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:12.073
WHAT THE PENALTY --

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:15.176
SO THERE'S NO ZERO CORAL OUR

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:15.876
OUTREACH --

01:35:15.943 --> 01:35:17.645
BUT THE THE ONE THING WE

01:35:17.711 --> 01:35:18.512
IDENTIFIED THAT WE ALSO HEARD

01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:19.613
FROM --

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.215
COMMUNITIES.

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:22.850
THEY WERE WORKING DOING OUTREACH

01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:24.885
AND AGENTS WAS THAT CONCERNED --

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:27.788
NOW WHY DID THAT SHOW UP ONLY IN

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:29.590
IN LANGUAGE IN OUR DATA ANALYSIS

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.058
AND NOT FOR INSTANCE --

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:33.027
IN THI --

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:34.395
DIFFERENCE IN LATINO ENROLLMENT

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:37.398
DIDN'T SHOW UP THERE THE

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:38.666
DIFFERENCE IN THE DROP.

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:39.500
OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT YOU'RE

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.035
MORE APT TO HAVE PEOPLE SPEAK IN

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:41.635
LANGUAGE --

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:43.137
BE MORE CONNECTED TO THE RECENT

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:44.805
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND MORE

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:46.273
CONCERNED ABOUT --

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:48.742
THE INAPPROPRIATELY BEING SCARED

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:50.244
OFF FROM GETTING COVERS BECAUSE

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:51.812
THE PUBLIC CHARGE ISSUE --

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:54.381
AND SO I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK MORE

01:35:54.448 --> 01:35:55.916
ANOTHER TIME ABOUT OUR OUT REACH --

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:58.252
INVESTMENTS WE MAKE A LOT OF THE

01:35:58.319 --> 01:35:59.620
GETS REALLY IMPORTANT --

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:01.589
STAND THAT IN CALIFORNIA.

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:02.857
WE HAVE A STATE BASED

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:05.292
MARKETPLACE COVER CALIFORNIA IN

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:07.228
DOLLARS IN A FULL RANGE OF

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:09.196
ADVERTISING COMMUNITY OUT REACH

01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:10.764
NAVIGATOR AWARDS.

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.199
IN CONTRAST TO THE FEDERAL

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:13.834
GOVERNMENT WHICH SUPPORTS OUT

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.269
REACH FOR THIRTY NINE STATES

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:17.638
SPENDS TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON

01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:19.607
ADVERTISING --

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:20.141
AND ABOUT THE SAME ON THE

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:21.709
NAVIGATOR PROGRAM SO WE ARE

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:23.878
SPENDING A LOT WE THINK WE'RE

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:24.845
SPENDING IT WELL --

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:27.481
WE DID INVEST MORE THIS YEAR A

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:29.483
LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:31.051
OF THE PENALTY REMOVAL --

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:32.186
BUT THAT --

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:33.420
YOU KNOW ACROSS THE WHOLE RANGE

ANOTHER PIECE ON THE PRIOR PAGES

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.936
OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE LESS

01:43:29.002 --> 01:43:31.772
THAN 40% AND SO IT IT THE

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:33.273
COMBINATIONS OF THERE'S THERE'S

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.308
SHOT SORT OF A TWO BY TWO SQUARE

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:35.175
OF OPTIONS.

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:37.044
HOW MUCH ARE YOU FUNDING

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:38.211
FINANCIAL HELP CITIES THAT

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:40.414
PREMIUM TILL PEOPLE GET THEIR

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.115
COVERAGE?

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:43.317
AND IT'S ABOVE AND BELOW.

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:44.251
FOUR HUNDRED OR HOW MUCH YOU

01:43:44.318 --> 01:43:46.286
DOING FOR CULTURE RIGHT EACH OF

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:47.721
THESE OFFICE LAYOUT THOSE OFFER

01:43:47.788 --> 01:43:49.456
THAT'S EXACTLY I THINK.

01:43:49.523 --> 01:43:50.824
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT

01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:53.760
PLANTS OF LOOKING AT YEP IT IS

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:55.262
ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT.

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:55.629
YOU KNOW WITH.

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:58.098
THE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:43:58.165 --> 01:43:59.232
ISHQ.

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:02.669
TARGET TO USE FOR SUBSIDIES --

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.571
YEAH THE I MEAN THE THING THAT

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:06.306
IT'S IMPORTANT NOTICE BUT WHEN

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:08.809
YOU'RE DEALING WITH THOSE --

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:10.644
PEOPLE RIGHT ABOVE THE CLIFF.

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:12.045
NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN USE A LOT OF

01:44:12.112 --> 01:44:12.913
SUBSIDY DOLLARS.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.881
BECAUSE THEY ARE WAY UNDER WATER

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:16.617
TODAY -- SO

01:44:16.683 --> 01:44:18.352
BENEFITING --

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:20.520
THE NEW ENROLLMENT OF FIFTY

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:21.688
THOUSAND OR SO IS ACTUALLY

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:24.157
RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE THREE

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:24.791
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:44:24.858 --> 01:44:24.958
SO.

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:27.194
AS OPPOSED TO SPREADING SMALLER

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.529
NUMBERS ACROSS A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:44:29.596 --> 01:44:32.132
AT THAT TWO FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:32.799
WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:33.533
GET COVER --

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.369
IT WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE BUT

01:44:35.435 --> 01:44:37.704
SMALLER DOLLAR AMUNTS ON A PER

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:39.373
PERSON BASIS THAT SELF AND AGAIN

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:40.474
THAT THAT'S WHAT THE REPORTS

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:41.608
TRYING TO LAY OUT THE POLICY

01:44:41.675 --> 01:44:43.343
OUGHT TO GET FOR YOU RATHER SAY

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:44.111
HERE'S THE EXACT RIGHT FOR NOW

01:44:44.177 --> 01:44:45.612
OKAY I GOT THAT I THINK --

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:47.914
BUT I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT

01:44:47.981 --> 01:44:50.183
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO MUCH WE

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:51.718
WANT TO WORK WITH I THINK WAS

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.186
SUGGESTED WE MIGHT LOOK AT ELLIE

01:44:53.253 --> 01:44:54.554
IS SUGGESTED WE HAD OTHER

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:56.523
REVENUE SOURCES ARE.

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:57.758
ARE EVEN GENERAL FUND HOW MUCH

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:58.392
WE WANT TO PUT IN ESPECIALLY

01:44:58.458 --> 01:44:59.626
WE'RE GONNA DO AN INDIVIDUAL

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:02.396
MANDATE I THINK THERE'S ALSO --

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:03.764
I I GET THE IDEA IN TERMS OF

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:05.399
WELL HOW MANY PEOPLE WE CAN HELP

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:08.268
AND CERTAINLY SINCE THE BELOW

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:08.802
FOUR HUNDRED ALREADY HAVE

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:10.937
EXISTING SUBSIDIES FEDERAL

01:45:11.004 --> 01:45:12.839
CREDITS AT CETERA.

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:14.107
WE DON'T NEED TO PUT HIS.

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:16.510
FOOT AS MUCH PER PERSON RIGHT TO

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:18.078
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:20.147
ALSO A BIG NOTE THAT THE PEOPLE

01:45:20.213 --> 01:45:22.215
OVER THE CLIFF RIGHT I MEAN WE

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:22.783
MAY HAVE TO SPEND MORE PER

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:23.950
PERSON WE'RE ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT

01:45:24.017 --> 01:45:25.352
JUST TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE OVER

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:26.386
4100% WERE TELL YOUR PEOPLE

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:27.954
REFORM 2%.

01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:30.424
OR ESSENTIALLY ELDER LEVEL

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:33.260
ELDERLY CDL STUDY I WILL USE

01:45:33.326 --> 01:45:34.861
THAT ALL OTHER.

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:36.797
USEFUL --

01:45:36.863 --> 01:45:40.267
THE WHAT ADVANCED YOUTH MATURE

01:45:40.333 --> 01:45:42.569
ATTENDANCE PERSONALLY TALK AT

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:44.404
HAND RIGHT NOW.

01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:46.073
SAY BUT RIGHT.

01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:46.940
SO BUT I MEAN IT'S SO PEOPLE

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:48.408
BEFORE THEY CAN GET ON TO

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:49.409
MEDICARE RIGHT SO I MEAN THE

01:45:49.476 --> 01:45:50.677
REASON THAT THEY COST A LOT MORE

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:53.547
IS BECAUSE WELL.

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.348
AS BECAUSE THEY ARE AT HIGHER

01:45:55.415 --> 01:46:02.022
RISK OF GETTING SICK AND THAT'S

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:04.391
WHY WE THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH GO

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:07.961
OUT COMPARED TO YOUNG NO THAT IT

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:08.662
WAS THERE FOR THAT WE JUST ALLOW

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:10.664
THAT REALLY RUN IT WOULD BE EVEN

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:11.798
MORE EXPENSIVE.

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:13.834
SO THE THE CHALLENGE HERE THOSE

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:15.268
IT'S ALSO IN MANY WAYS WE TALK

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:16.737
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:18.105
INSURANCE THAT'S THERE WHEN YOU

01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:19.272
NEED IT RIGHT.

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:20.474
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:21.641
KNOW WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT HERE

01:46:21.708 --> 01:46:23.276
IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T THAT'S

01:46:23.343 --> 01:46:24.244
WHAT WOULD HAVE SHORT TERM PLANS

01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:25.779
IT'S UNDER A WE DON'T MAKE

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:26.713
PROMISES WE DON'T KEEP.

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.149
SO TO ME THAT AND EVEN THOUGH IT

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.484
MAY BE YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:33.053
FEWER PEOPLE HELPED PER DOLLAR --

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.921
THAT IS A POPULATION I THINK

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:36.723
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:37.657
FROM WHO HAVE.

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:41.194
A VERY LARGE NEEDS BECAUSE

01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:41.762
BASICALLY THEY'RE FACING THE

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:42.162
CLIFF [inaudible]

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:44.264
AND TRUE I'D AND I'M NOT SAYING

01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:45.966
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING LESS

01:46:46.032 --> 01:46:46.900
ARE NOT HAVING THEIR

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:48.268
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES BUT THEY

01:46:48.335 --> 01:46:49.402
BUT I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:46:49.469 --> 01:46:50.537
ABOUT -- I

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:52.939
NOW JUMP UP THAT NINE HUNDRED

01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:54.007
RIGHT I MEAN SIMILARLY DOUBLING

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:55.342
RIGHT FROM WHEN YOU'RE CROSSING

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:56.610
THE LINE --

01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:57.944
THIS FREEMAN'S AND GIVEN THAT

01:46:58.011 --> 01:47:00.714
THE HOW HIGH THIS PREMIUMS ARE --

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:04.918
FOR PEOPLE OF THAT AGE BRACKET --

01:47:04.985 --> 01:47:06.119
I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

01:47:06.186 --> 01:47:07.320
HOW TO HELP THEM RIGHT --

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:09.456
SO BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:10.757
BASICALLY SAY WALL BRADY GOT I

01:47:10.824 --> 01:47:11.792
DON'T GET SICK ARE MORE LIKELY

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:12.526
TO GET SICK.

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:13.727
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE THE PENALTY

01:47:13.794 --> 01:47:16.029
AND THEN GOD BLESS ME IF YOU

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:17.297
KNOW I A CREEL AT THAT DOES

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:19.299
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS AND I

01:47:19.366 --> 01:47:20.967
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT.

01:47:21.034 --> 01:47:22.736
ONE I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS THE

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.104
6100% I MEAN.

01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:25.472
REALIZE THAT TO YOUR WE WANT TO

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:27.040
TRY TO HELP PEOPLE OR LOWER

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:28.975
INCOME BETTER BUT ZERO REASON

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:30.377
FOR THE 6100% --

01:47:30.443 --> 01:47:32.479
DUTY WHAT A WHAT A AS OF WHAT

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:33.313
WITH WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.614
SOMEONE WHO LIVES AND IT WAS

01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:35.916
POINTED OUT EARLIER WHO LIVES IN

01:47:35.982 --> 01:47:38.285
THAT AREA I MEAN I REPRESENTS

01:47:38.351 --> 01:47:40.120
ACTING METTLE TO BUT I MEAN.

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:44.291
WHAT WHAT THE SIX IS AT THE

01:47:44.357 --> 01:47:44.891
SECOND PERCENT THE RIGHT PLACE

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:48.595
WE IS THAT THE RIGHT PLACE RIGHT --

01:47:48.662 --> 01:47:50.697
SO WE HAVE TALK ABOUT PREMIUM

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:51.731
HELP AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COST

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:52.399
OF IT.

01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:54.301
SO -- SO

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:55.202
THAT I MEAN I THINK WE NEED TO

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.937
POSE SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND

01:47:57.003 --> 01:47:59.139
LOOK AT SO WHAT IS THE I GUESS

01:47:59.206 --> 01:48:00.707
WE DO SOME SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:02.876
LOOK AT LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE YOU

01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:03.410
KNOW WHAT.

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:04.344
WHAT WHAT WHERE THE INFLECTION

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:06.346
POINTS ARE RIGHT THIS IS THAT

01:48:06.413 --> 01:48:07.714
HIGH ENOUGH OR IS THAT WE CREATE

01:48:07.781 --> 01:48:10.617
A NEW CLASS THAT --

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:13.553
WE'RE GONNA BE STRUGGLING WITH.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.355
IF I COULD TALK SEND THESE TWO

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.824
THINGS IN YOUR THE COMPREHENSIVE

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:20.527
MODEL HAS NO CLICK AT THE END

01:48:20.594 --> 01:48:21.561
PART THAT'S PART OF WHY IT'S

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:22.262
MORE EXPENSIVE --

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:23.663
BUT THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOMES

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:26.299
RISES AS IT GOES UP BUT IN BACK

01:48:26.366 --> 01:48:26.900
TO THE QUESTION AN INFLECTION

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:28.802
POINT IF YOU'RE THE PERSON OVER

01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:30.303
THE CLIP IT DOESN'T IF IT'S LIKE

01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:30.971
A INFLECTION MATTER WHAT.

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:32.005
BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DROPS

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:33.907
DRAMATICALLY AS YOU GO UP THE IN

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:36.543
COUNTRY BECAUSE OVER 6100%.

01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:39.446
GENERALLY PEOPLE MAKING THAT

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:43.016
MUCH MONEY HUGE PERCENT OF THEIR

01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:44.784
INCOME AND I JUST THINK THAT'S

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:45.585
AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE THE

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:47.020
OTHER TO NOTE IS THAT.

01:48:47.087 --> 01:48:49.256
IT IS ALSO.

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:50.790
AN ISSUE OF WHERE YOU LIVE IN

01:48:50.857 --> 01:48:51.791
YOUR HEALTHCARE COSTS SO

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:54.527
SACRAMENTO LIKE THE BAY AREA IS

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:55.695
2230% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN LA

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:57.964
THERE REALLY PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE

01:48:58.031 --> 01:48:59.633
FOR THE SAME COVERAGE --

01:48:59.699 --> 01:49:01.635
ARE SPENDING EIGHT HUNDRED

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:03.069
DOLLARS MORE A MONTH THAN THE

01:49:03.136 --> 01:49:04.804
EXACT SAME COVERAGE IN LOS

01:49:04.871 --> 01:49:07.007
ANGELES AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:08.441
THAT HAVING A JUST LIKE THIS

01:49:08.508 --> 01:49:08.875
THAT INCOME BASED.

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:10.644
AND BASED ON THE COST OF YOUR

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.979
HEALTH CARE WHERE YOU LIVE

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:14.481
ADJUST.

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:16.082
FOR OKAY AND THEN I ONE OTHER

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.850
QUESTION --

01:49:16.917 --> 01:49:18.451
AND IN THE REPORT I KNOW THAT WE

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:19.719
DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH ON IT HERE

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:20.520
YET -- I

01:49:20.587 --> 01:49:21.988
JUST MENTIONED REINSURANCE I

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:22.822
KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:24.858
CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE WAY

01:49:24.925 --> 01:49:26.893
THAT MADE THE OUR RELATIONSHIP

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.894
WITH THAT THE CURRENT

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:29.195
ADMINISTRATION --

01:49:29.262 --> 01:49:31.064
BUT CAN YOU AT THERE LOOKS LIKE

01:49:31.131 --> 01:49:32.232
THERE'S SOME POTENTIAL

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:33.967
OPPORTUNITIES PERHAPS IN THE

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:34.634
FUTURE IF --

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:35.835
WE HAVE --

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:36.636
CAN YOU JUST TOUCH ON THAT

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:38.305
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S AN

01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:39.906
OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW DOWN.

01:49:39.973 --> 01:49:42.242
A RESOURCES AS WELL WELL TWO

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:43.944
THINGS AT ONE THING I'D GO TO

01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:45.745
THIS IS WHERE I APPRECIATION FOR

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:48.281
THE LEGISLATURE CALLING WE

01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:50.016
DIDN'T JUST DELIVER IT TO YOU WE

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:51.785
DELIVERED IT TO CONGRESS --

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:53.219
AND OF THE CORD A MINISTRATION

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:55.088
IN MANY WAYS REINSURANCE I THINK

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:56.423
IS --

01:49:56.489 --> 01:49:58.959
ECONOMICALLY PHENOMENALLY SOUND

01:49:59.025 --> 01:50:00.727
INSTRUMENT BUT IT WAS IN PLACE

01:50:00.794 --> 01:50:02.195
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THE

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:02.862
FIRST THREE YEARS THE AFFORDABLE

01:50:02.929 --> 01:50:03.997
CARE ACT --

01:50:04.064 --> 01:50:05.031
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BRINGING

01:50:05.098 --> 01:50:07.334
IT BACK HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSION

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.735
AS PART OF BIPARTISAN

01:50:08.802 --> 01:50:10.670
DISCUSSIONS FOR STABILIZE AN

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:12.238
INDIVIDUAL MARKETS ACROSS THE

01:50:12.305 --> 01:50:13.373
NATION --

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.508
DOING IT ON A STATE BASIS WHERE

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:17.644
STATES FROM SOME OF THE MONEY

01:50:17.711 --> 01:50:18.979
SEVEN STATES HAVE DONE THAT --

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:20.146
BUT I THINK.

01:50:20.213 --> 01:50:21.648
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE THE

01:50:21.715 --> 01:50:24.317
MATCHES SO TO SPEAK TO LEVERAGE

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:25.218
FEDERAL FUNDS TO MAKE THERE'S

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:26.453
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THE

01:50:26.519 --> 01:50:28.388
ADMINISTRATION WOULD MATCH FUND

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:30.023
ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA RESURGENT

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:30.657
A PENALTY.

01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:31.825
AT THE SAME TIME IS A SOUGHT

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:33.893
REINSURANCE FUNDS --

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.795
FOR REINSURANCE SO I APPRECIATE

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:36.763
THAT I IF I WANT TO BE SURE WE

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.365
KEEP DOWN THE RADAR SCREEN AND

01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:39.299
ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:40.567
OPTION WE SHOULD CONSIDER

01:50:40.633 --> 01:50:42.769
EXERCISING AT SOME POINT --

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:44.971
SO PERHAPS AT A TIME WHERE --

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:46.873
THERE MAY BE A MORE REASONABLE --

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:47.974
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:49.976
FEDERAL MATCH WOULD BE AND I

01:50:50.043 --> 01:50:50.910
THINK THAT'S REPORT THE OTHER

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:51.878
THING I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE

01:50:51.945 --> 01:50:53.546
ALSO IS IS THAT THE DOLLARS WE

01:50:53.613 --> 01:50:55.448
SPEND ON HEALTHCARE --

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:56.850
JOE ONLY THEIR LOCAL THEY STAY

01:50:56.916 --> 01:50:59.119
HERE AND THEN THE PEOPLE THAT IS

01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:00.620
DOLLARS EMPLOYEE --

01:51:00.687 --> 01:51:03.256
THEN PAY TAXES SO THERE IS AN

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:04.224
ECONOMIC.

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:08.495
SO WE OF CLEARLY HEALTH CARE IS

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:11.498
A COST FOR SOMETHING WE NEED TO

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:13.433
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:13.967
SO SOME OF THE MONEY WE'RE

01:51:14.034 --> 01:51:15.001
PUTTING IN.

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:16.770
ACTUALLY IS SPECIAL WE CAN DRAW

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:18.538
THE MORE FEDERAL MONEY AND OF

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:19.706
THOSE THROUGH CREDITS OR OTHER

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:21.408
TYPES OF THINGS WILL ALSO COME

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:23.576
BACK TO OUR OWN ECONOMY HERE --

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:25.045
YEAH IT'S THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH

01:51:25.111 --> 01:51:26.212
OF HEALTH CARE THAT'S EXPORTER

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:28.314
IMPORTED FROM OTHER STATES OR

01:51:28.381 --> 01:51:29.649
OTHER OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST OF

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:31.518
ITS RIGHT HERE SO I WANT TO KEEP

01:51:31.584 --> 01:51:33.420
THAT IN MIND TOO WHEN WE'RE

01:51:33.486 --> 01:51:35.355
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE DO THE

01:51:35.422 --> 01:51:36.523
MONEY HALLETT.

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:38.291
CIRCLES AROUND AND ACTUALLY --

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:40.560
SHE BENEFITS CAN BENEFIT OUR

01:51:40.627 --> 01:51:42.796
ECONOMY TO THANK YOU.

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:43.696
HELLO JUST BE PUT ON THAT POINT

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:44.330

01:51:44.397 --> 01:51:44.631
THE REPORT.

01:51:44.697 --> 01:51:46.099
IS VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE OFFICE

01:51:46.166 --> 01:51:47.767
OF THE EXPAND COVERAGE EXPAND

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:49.869
FEDERAL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA

01:51:49.936 --> 01:51:50.804
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ADVANCED

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:52.472
PREMIUM TAX CREDIT WHEN YOU GET

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:54.741
INCREASED ENROLLMENT.

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:56.543
MANY THIS BILLION IN ROLES ARE

01:51:56.609 --> 01:51:58.111
GETTING FEDERAL.

01:51:58.178 --> 01:52:02.315
TAX CREDIT SO IT IT DOES HAVE

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:02.882
THAT EFFECT IT EVEN FROM US

01:52:02.949 --> 01:52:04.617
RIGHT HERE.

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:05.118
THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN --

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:08.021
FRAZIER.

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:10.490
THE THING MISTER OF HAS THERE

01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:12.392
BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION OF FOR

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:13.460
THE MAYBE THE INTELLECTUAL

01:52:13.526 --> 01:52:13.960
DEVELOPMENT.

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:16.096
DEVELOPMENTALLY --

01:52:16.162 --> 01:52:18.164
DECEMBER COMMUNITY IN FISCAL --

01:52:18.231 --> 01:52:19.232
OF DISABLED COMMUNITIES AS FAR

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:22.135
AS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:24.671
MEDICALLY FRAGILE THE OP

01:52:24.737 --> 01:52:27.207
OFTENTIMES IT --

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:31.010
THERE ARE COMPLETELY --

01:52:31.077 --> 01:52:32.712
GARNER BUT HEALTH AS WELL WE'RE

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:34.414
FOR AB AND ALL THAT I HAVEN'T

01:52:34.481 --> 01:52:36.116
SEEN ANYTHING THAT COVERS.

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:40.653
YOU KNOW THE IDT CHILDREN OR

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:43.690
ADULTS THERE ARE.

01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:45.692
EACH OF THEIR PARENTS --

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:46.860
I I ACTUALLY IN THIS IS --

01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:48.928
BUT A IN THE SCOPE MORE A DH CS

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:50.029
AND MEDI CAL IN THOSE RANGE OF

01:52:50.096 --> 01:52:51.364
PROGRAMS AND WITHIN COVERED

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:51.698
CALIFORNIA --

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:53.333
BECAUSE THE INCOME STANDARDS ARE

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:54.067
ABOVE.

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:55.268
A 130% OF POVERTY OFTEN DOESN'T

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:57.203
HIT THERE WE DO HAVE A RANGE OF

01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:59.973
THINGS THAT ARE PER EACH OTHER

01:53:00.039 --> 01:53:01.674
HEALTHCARE NEEDS DIRECTLY MET

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:02.876
BUT IF YOU'RE.

01:53:02.942 --> 01:53:03.510
ASKING INCREDIBLY GOOD QUESTION

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:05.278
IS SORT OF LARGELY OUT OF OUR

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:07.480
SCOPE OF OF WEARABLES LIKE IS.

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:09.516
THE REASON I ASK IS SOMETIMES

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:10.817
THERE ARE.

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:12.619
INDIVIDUALS IT DON'T GET DIRECT

01:53:12.685 --> 01:53:13.620
SERVICES.

01:53:13.686 --> 01:53:14.854
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:15.955
CALLED THE TWEETERS RIGHT.

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:17.590
AND SO HAVE WE TAKEN THAT INTO

01:53:17.657 --> 01:53:19.526
CONSIDERATION WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:20.827
AT THAT --

01:53:20.894 --> 01:53:24.697
POPULATION --

01:53:24.764 --> 01:53:25.565
SINGLE PARENT.

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:28.034
MAKES TOO MUCH MONEY BUT A LOT

01:53:28.101 --> 01:53:29.869
OF INVOLVEMENT WITH.

01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:32.505
OF MEDICALLY FRAGILE --

01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:34.207
FOR DUAL DIAGNOSIS.

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:37.277
SO I MEAN THERE'S A POPULATION

01:53:37.343 --> 01:53:39.979
THERE THAT THAT.

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:42.382
I THINK HAS BEEN MISSED.

01:53:42.448 --> 01:53:43.383
WELL I SURE HAVE A POLL OF THE I

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:43.917
DON'T THINK WE'RE MISSING

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:45.018
POPULATION BUT I THINK THAT YOU

01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:45.485
SHOULD KNOW THAT --

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:46.152
WITHIN COVERED CALIFORNIA AS AN

01:53:46.219 --> 01:53:48.087
EXAMPLE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.522
PORTION OF OUR AND ROLLED

01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:52.158
PARENTS HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE

01:53:52.225 --> 01:53:53.259
MEDICAL COVERAGE IS PART OF THE

01:53:53.326 --> 01:53:54.794
DYNAMICS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:56.763
ACT IS TO HAVE A LOWER.

01:53:56.829 --> 01:53:59.933
INCOME THRESHOLD FOR MEDI CAL --

01:53:59.999 --> 01:54:01.134
FOR CHILDREN THEY DO FOR PARENTS

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:02.702
SO WE ACTUALLY SPENT A LOT OF

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:05.004
TIME --

01:54:05.071 --> 01:54:05.238
WORKING.

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:09.042
VERY CLOSELY FAMILIES.

01:54:09.108 --> 01:54:10.009
HAVE ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:11.678
NEEDS MET EVEN THOUGH THERE IS

01:54:11.744 --> 01:54:12.912
ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THE A LOT OF

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.180
FAMILIES THAT HAVE.

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:16.216
DIFFERENT COVERAGE OF KIDS

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:16.816
VERSUS PARENTS.

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:20.320
AND THESE KIDS.

01:54:20.386 --> 01:54:20.954
TURN INTO ADULTS AND NEVER LEAVE

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.356
HOME.

01:54:23.423 --> 01:54:24.757
IF THEIR KIDS ARE LEAVING HOME

01:54:24.824 --> 01:54:25.892
THEY ARE THEY ARE I WOULD BET

01:54:25.959 --> 01:54:27.126
DOLLARS TO DOUGHNUTS THEIR

01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:28.595
COVERAGE WOULD CONTINUE AS

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:30.430
PERMANENT DISABLED AND UNDER A

01:54:30.496 --> 01:54:31.864
PUBLIC PROGRAM.

01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:33.866
NOT UNDER COVER CALIFORNIA'S --

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:35.335
SUBSIDIZE --

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:36.636
HEALTHCARE COVERAGE BUT SO SO

01:54:36.703 --> 01:54:37.904
THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE THE

01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:40.873
THE BATON GETS PASSED SO TO

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:41.441
SPEAK UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU.

ISSUE OF PREVENTION --

01:54:58.124 --> 01:55:00.093
HEALTH INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:02.161
BUT ONE OF THE DRIVERS OF IN

AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH

01:55:02.929 --> 01:55:04.530

01:55:04.597 --> 01:55:07.267
INCREASING AMOUNTS OF DISEASE IN

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:09.535
THE GENERAL POPULATION --

01:55:09.602 --> 01:55:11.604
ONE OF THE LEADING EXAMPLES OF

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:14.340
THAT IS --

01:55:14.407 --> 01:55:18.244

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:31.591
EXTRAORDINARY COST FOR EXAMPLE

01:55:31.658 --> 01:55:34.761

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:42.068
POTENTIAL FOR USING REVENUE FROM

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:44.037
THE SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE

01:55:44.103 --> 01:55:47.840

LEGISLATION FOR THE PAST TWO

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:53.980
YEARS AND THAT.

THE AUTHOR THIS YEAR AND IN FACT

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:58.284
THAT HE DOES TO GENERATE A

01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:00.586
CONSIDERABLE ABOUT OF REVENUE

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:03.156
AND IN IN OUR MODELING.

01:56:03.222 --> 01:56:05.024
BUT THE EXPENDITURE PLAN IS

01:56:05.091 --> 01:56:08.027
FOCUSED ON PREVENTION EFFORTS --

01:56:08.094 --> 01:56:10.563
AND AND SO IT JUST WONDERING IF

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:14.500
YOU CAN --

01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:15.668
DISCUSS HOW THIS FITS INTO THE

01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:16.869
OVERALL PLANNING BECAUSE

01:56:16.936 --> 01:56:18.905
OBVIOUSLY THE A DISEASE YOU

01:56:18.971 --> 01:56:21.341
PREVENT --

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:22.809
EVERY DISEASE THAT YOU PREVENT

01:56:22.875 --> 01:56:25.411
LOWERS THE OVERALL COST OF

01:56:25.478 --> 01:56:33.786
HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE --

01:56:33.853 --> 01:56:37.156
SECTORS IN THE SEC KIRSTINE WITH

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:39.158
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:40.226
QUESTION THROUGHOUT THE RESERVE.

01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:44.263
SO AS WE NOTED I THINK SO WE AT

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:46.933
LEAST REPORT IN --

01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:51.637
SUGARY DRINK TAXES AND CERTAINLY --

01:56:51.704 --> 01:56:54.507
SO AS A SORT OF A FIRST STEP IN

01:56:54.574 --> 01:56:56.008
THAT SORT OF ACT CHAIN OF

01:56:56.075 --> 01:56:59.278
CAUSATION THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING --

01:56:59.345 --> 01:57:01.180
WOULD BE --

01:57:01.247 --> 01:57:03.216
FOR THE TAX TO HAVE SERVED THE

01:57:03.282 --> 01:57:06.085
BEHAVIORAL AFFECT OF REDUCING --

01:57:06.152 --> 01:57:07.186
SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:09.088
CONSUMPTION IN AND WE DO

01:57:09.155 --> 01:57:10.656
ESTIMATE --

01:57:10.723 --> 01:57:11.891
IN THE REPORT AND IN OUR

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:15.495
ANALYSIS OF A SIMILAR INITIATIVE --

01:57:15.561 --> 01:57:16.562
LAST YEAR THAT --

01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:18.264
IT SAYS STATEWIDE TAX OF THE

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:20.066
MAGNITUDE UNDER DISCUSSION WOULD

01:57:20.133 --> 01:57:22.668
HAVE THIS A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT

01:57:22.735 --> 01:57:23.903
IN THAT REGARD --

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:27.006
THE QUESTION THEN IS --

01:57:27.073 --> 01:57:29.175
BASED ON THAT INITIAL RESPONSE

01:57:29.242 --> 01:57:31.778
GAUGING SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:57:31.844 --> 01:57:33.312
SUBSEQUENT --

01:57:33.379 --> 01:57:36.015
CHANGES IN AND HEALTH SUCH AS

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:37.650
THE CHANGE IN IN DIABETES THAT

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:39.051
YOU'RE REFERRING TO AND AND

01:57:39.118 --> 01:57:40.219
CERTAINLY --

01:57:40.286 --> 01:57:41.521
OF THAT SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF

01:57:41.587 --> 01:57:43.623
BEEN DISCUSSED IN CONTEMPLATED I

01:57:43.689 --> 01:57:46.292
THINK IN OUR WORK WE WEREN'T --

01:57:46.359 --> 01:57:47.794
JUDICIARY THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.061
OF THE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES THAT

01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:50.463
COULD OCCUR WE WEREN'T IN A

01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:52.331
POSITION TO TO QUANTIFY THAT AND

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:53.699
I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING

01:57:53.766 --> 01:57:54.934
CERTAINLY THAT IS --

01:57:55.001 --> 01:57:59.405
A POSSIBILITY.

01:57:59.472 --> 01:58:01.140
THANK YOU I WOULD JUST POINT OUT

01:58:01.207 --> 01:58:02.975

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:05.011
TWO CENTS PER OUNCE THE

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:06.646
PROJECTED REVENUE --

01:58:06.712 --> 01:58:07.547
FROM THE SUGAR SWEETENED

01:58:07.613 --> 01:58:09.715
BEVERAGE TAX WOULD BE SOMEWHERE

01:58:09.782 --> 01:58:11.417
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ONE POINT

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:13.019
EIGHT TWO TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:13.619
ANNUALLY --

01:58:13.686 --> 01:58:16.556
THAT'S A CONSIDER THAT HAS

01:58:16.622 --> 01:58:19.292
POTENTIAL --

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:20.226
FOR SCHOOL NURSES --

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:21.461

WOULD TAKE --

01:58:29.335 --> 01:58:31.103
OF THAT NATURE WOULD TAKE

01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:33.940
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE ON

01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:38.377
DIABETES PREVENTION FROM THE

MENTION THAT ABOUT 3% OF THE

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:14.780
INCREASE THAT WE SEE ON AN

01:59:14.847 --> 01:59:16.482
ANNUAL BASIS AND HEALTH CARE NOW

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:18.451

TO NOT HAVING THE MANDATE IS

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:22.555
THAT CORRECT.

01:59:22.622 --> 01:59:24.223

IN ONE YEAR SO WE THINK SOME OF

01:59:36.769 --> 01:59:38.404
THE PLANS PRICED A LITTLE BIT

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:39.539
FOR THE PRIOR YEAR THEY WOULD

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:40.940
PRICE MORE FOR NEXT YEAR THE

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.575
OVERALL ESTIMATES WE SEE

01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:43.976

02:00:46.606 --> 02:00:48.507
COACHELLA AREA --

02:00:48.574 --> 02:00:50.176

02:00:58.684 --> 02:01:01.287
EMPATHIZE WITH THE MATURE PEOPLE

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:03.255

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:04.924
WHICH I AM --

02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:07.360
WILL SET UP A FEW THINGS --

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:08.561
THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT CLIFF

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:09.895
IS A IS A STEEP CLIFFS YOU KNOW

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:10.463
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF SENIOR

02:01:10.529 --> 02:01:13.132
CITIZENS THAT --

02:01:13.199 --> 02:01:17.036
YOU KNOW ARE LIVING LONGER --

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:20.439
HEALTHIER --

02:01:20.506 --> 02:01:22.274
G. BUT OF THE PLANET THEIR

02:01:22.341 --> 02:01:23.743
FUNDING IS NOT THAT THEY PUT

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:24.910
AWAY FOR RETIREMENT ISN'T

02:01:24.977 --> 02:01:26.879
MATCHING THE THE LONGEVITY OF

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:27.913
THEIR LIVES.

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:29.181
SO.

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:30.416
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:31.951
COVER CALIFORNIA PLAN IS

02:01:32.018 --> 02:01:33.452
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT PUT --

02:01:33.519 --> 02:01:36.255
ARE.

02:01:36.322 --> 02:01:38.491
LITTLE PEOPLE TO MAKE LESS MONEY --

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:40.192
AND FINANCIAL PERIL TO THE POINT

02:01:40.259 --> 02:01:41.360
WHERE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GET

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:42.995
INSURANCE AND I CERTAINLY DON'T

02:01:43.062 --> 02:01:44.497
WANT TO PUT OUR SENIOR

02:01:44.563 --> 02:01:45.765
POPULATIONS --

02:01:45.831 --> 02:01:47.900
IN PERIL OF EXHAUSTING THEIR

02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:50.236
SAVINGS AND HAVING FINANCIAL

02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:52.204
DEVASTATION --

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:54.073
AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE THAT

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.242
THE HEALTH ATTRIBUTES OF A OF A

02:01:56.308 --> 02:01:58.310
SODA TAX --

02:01:58.377 --> 02:01:59.245

02:01:59.311 --> 02:02:00.179
TAXES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED

02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:01.614
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:02.415
THE PAST FOUR YEARS THAT I'VE

02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:04.116
BEEN HERE --

02:02:04.183 --> 02:02:05.484
HAVE BEEN VERY REGRESSIVE THAT

02:02:05.551 --> 02:02:07.720
THE THE LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS

02:02:07.787 --> 02:02:11.023

CONSTITUENTS.

02:02:18.631 --> 02:02:21.033
SO GETTING BACK TO I'M GOING I'M

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:22.268
GOING TO APPOINT YOU'RE JUST

STATE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR --

02:02:30.676 --> 02:02:32.378
AND AND IT WAS UNCLEAR ABOUT THE

02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:33.679
CLIFF IS NOT GOING TO HELP THE

02:02:33.746 --> 02:02:34.780
PEOPLE OF THE CLIFF.

02:02:34.847 --> 02:02:38.451
OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE.

02:02:38.517 --> 02:02:42.588
IF I COULD AND I THINK YOUR YOU

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.256

HELP PEOPLE ABOVE 40% OF POVERTY.

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:53.666
FAR MORE THAN WOULD HELP PEOPLE

BELOW 40% OF POWERS A BACK TO

02:02:55.034 --> 02:02:56.068

YOU PAY THE SAME AMOUNT THE TAX

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:07.580
CREDIT JUST GOES DOWN.

02:03:07.646 --> 02:03:09.281
IF YOUR ABOUT 40% OF POVERTY AND

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:11.417

02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:16.756
THAT THE THING IS THAT THE AND I

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:19.191
I ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THAT --

02:03:19.258 --> 02:03:21.160
FAMILIES IT'S LIKE YOUR BROCCOLI

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:22.595
NO ONE WANTS TO BE TOLD TO ROCK

02:03:22.661 --> 02:03:23.395
LIKE -- BUT

02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:25.297
THE PRIME BENEFICIARIES OF A

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:27.800
PENALTY ARE ONE THE PEOPLE WHO

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:29.101
ARE KNOWLEDGE TO GET INSURANCE

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:30.369
AND DON'T END UP IN THE HOSPITAL

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:31.537
HAVE A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:37.076
DEBT. TO THE ON SUBS RIGHT

02:03:37.143 --> 02:03:37.676
PEOPLE THEY'RE PAYING LESS AND

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:42.014
PRE BUT THE THE PRIME NON

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:43.115
BENEFICIARIES --

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:46.318
SO TO SPEAK FINANCIALLY BACK TO

02:03:46.385 --> 02:03:47.853
THE THE IT'S A NOT A REGRESSIVE.

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:48.320
GRAHAM BUT THEY'RE NOT

02:03:48.387 --> 02:03:51.257
BENEFITING FROM THIS BECAUSE

02:03:51.323 --> 02:03:52.925
THEY JUST GET A LOWER TAX RATE.

02:03:52.992 --> 02:03:53.726
THAT MAKES SENSE IT MAKES SENSE

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:54.593
AND SO OBVIOUSLY THE MORE

02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:55.895
BENEFICIARIES SO WE CAN GET INTO

02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:57.196
THE SYSTEM THE MORE ABOUT HIM

02:03:57.263 --> 02:03:58.063
ACTUALLY GETTING IT'S IT'S

02:03:58.130 --> 02:03:59.231
BETTER FOR EVERYBODY.

02:03:59.298 --> 02:03:59.865
SO THE LAST THING I'M GOING TO

02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:02.802
MENTION IS THAT --

02:04:02.868 --> 02:04:03.803
THERE STILL WILL BE AN IMPACT ON

02:04:03.869 --> 02:04:05.137
LOWER INCOME PEOPLE.

02:04:05.204 --> 02:04:07.439
AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR OUR

02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:09.208
GENERAL FUND ROUGHLY 50% OF IT

02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:11.811
IS MADE UP OF 1% OF OUR

02:04:11.877 --> 02:04:13.879
POPULATION THAT IS THE WELL TO

02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:15.080
DO -- THE

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:16.348
TOP BUT TAX RATE I THINK IN

02:04:16.415 --> 02:04:17.850
STATE CALIFORNIA KNOWS THIRTEEN

02:04:17.917 --> 02:04:19.618
POINT 3% WHICH REPRESENTS MAYBE

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:21.153
ABOUT --

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:23.522
FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS FORTY FIVE

02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:24.423
TO FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS AND

02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:24.790
ELECTED LA --

02:04:24.857 --> 02:04:26.725
TO MAYBE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:04:26.792 --> 02:04:28.427
FINANCE TO OPINE THAT IF WE

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:32.464
RAISE THAT THIRTEEN POINT 3%. TO

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:34.433
THIRTEEN POINT 43% ACCORDING TO

02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:36.335
MY CALCULATIONS I GUESS IS THE

02:04:36.402 --> 02:04:37.136
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:39.038
IF YOU INCREASE IT BY A POINT

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:40.306
AND A HALF GOING FROM THIRTEEN

02:04:40.372 --> 02:04:41.874
POINT.

02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:43.042
THREE TO THIRTEEN POINT FOUR

02:04:43.108 --> 02:04:45.578
FIVE IT RAISES A BILLION DOLLARS

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:49.348
AND WITH THAT SUFFICE SO THAT WE

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:50.716
DON'T HAVE.

02:04:50.783 --> 02:04:52.351
TO ENTERTAIN THESE THINGS TAXES

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:55.287
AT THE LOWER LEVEL THAT ARE.

02:04:55.354 --> 02:04:56.789
WHETHER THEY ARE REGRESSIVE

02:04:56.856 --> 02:04:57.356
THEY'RE PERCEIVED AS BEING

02:04:57.423 --> 02:04:58.190
REGRESSIVE.

02:04:58.257 --> 02:05:03.429
AND SATISFYING THE NEEDS OF

02:05:03.495 --> 02:05:06.665
MAKING THAT THE COVER CALIFORNIA.

02:05:06.732 --> 02:05:09.068
WORKABLE HOLE AND SAY FOR

02:05:09.134 --> 02:05:10.669
EVERYBODY TO FEEL THAT THEY CAN

02:05:10.736 --> 02:05:11.470
GET INSURANCE WITHOUT

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:14.406
BANKRUPTING THEMSELVES.

02:05:14.473 --> 02:05:15.574
CAROLINE TO THE LEGISLATIVE

02:05:15.641 --> 02:05:17.109
ANALYST'S OFFICE SO I'D HAVE.

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:18.410
TO GO BACK AND LOOK SPECIFICALLY

02:05:18.477 --> 02:05:19.311
AT THE FIGURES THAT YOU

02:05:19.378 --> 02:05:20.913
REFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:22.414
OF REVENUE RAISED.

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:23.215
BUT IN TERMS OF INCREASING --

02:05:23.282 --> 02:05:26.352
THE RE TAX THERE ARE THERE ARE A

02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:28.487
VARIETY OF WAYS TO INCREASE THE

02:05:28.554 --> 02:05:29.889
RATES THERE COULD BE AN ACROSS

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:32.358
THE BOARD INCREASED EVERY RATE.

02:05:32.424 --> 02:05:35.060
IF YOU INCREASED EVERY RATE --

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:37.529
BY -- POINT

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:38.931
007% YOU WOULD RAISE ABOUT A

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:40.332
BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN THAT

02:05:40.399 --> 02:05:42.268
SCALES FROM THERE ALTERNATIVELY

02:05:42.334 --> 02:05:43.836
YOU COULD PROPORTIONALLY RAISE

02:05:43.903 --> 02:05:45.437
ALL OF THE RATES --

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:46.705
TO RAISE A BILLION DOLLARS THAT

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:48.741
WOULD REQUIRE RAISING EACH RATE

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:52.177
BY 1% OF THAT RATE SO THE BOTTOM

02:05:52.244 --> 02:05:54.546
RATE IS 1% YOU WOULD RAISE IT TO

02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:56.982
ONE POINT 001% AND SO FORTH SO

02:05:57.049 --> 02:05:57.516
THEY ARE ALL TURN AS WAS

02:05:57.583 --> 02:05:58.817
ELOQUENTLY STATED THOUGH THE

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:00.486
HIGHER YOUR INCOME THE LESS OF

02:06:00.552 --> 02:06:01.487
AN IMPACT.

02:06:01.553 --> 02:06:02.888
THESE HIGHER --

02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:06.725
AMOUNTS ARE ON YOUR BUDGET SO

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:09.061
THE WEALTHY ARE YOU ARE THE LESS --

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:09.695
OF IN YOUR TENT --

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:12.831
THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE --

02:06:12.898 --> 02:06:14.800
AND THAT'S WHY I I PREFER

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:17.236
SPECIFICALLY LOOKED AT THE TOP.

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:18.938
INCOME EARNERS THAT YOU DON'T

02:06:19.004 --> 02:06:20.806
WANT TO RAISE THE STATE INCOME

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:22.341
TAX -- YOU

02:06:22.408 --> 02:06:24.243
KNOW PROP --

02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:25.244
THIRTY WE DIDN'T SEE A MASS

02:06:25.311 --> 02:06:26.278
EXODUS OUT OF THE STATE OF

02:06:26.345 --> 02:06:27.980
CALIFORNIA BY THE VERY WEALTHY

02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:29.548
THE LIKE THE SUNSHINE AND LOVE

02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:30.416
THE BEACHES AND I'M.

02:06:30.482 --> 02:06:31.583
WONDERING IF WE LIMITED IT TO

02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:35.754
THE WE'VE PUSHED A POINT HALF

02:06:35.821 --> 02:06:36.322
ABOVE.

02:06:36.388 --> 02:06:38.023
WOULD IT GET AS THE BILLION

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:39.591
DOLLARS THAT I HAVE CALCULATED

02:06:39.658 --> 02:06:40.926
IN MY MIND THAT WOULD COME TO

02:06:40.993 --> 02:06:42.161
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:43.295
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THAT

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:44.630
SPECIFICALLY I'M SORRY I DON'T

02:06:44.697 --> 02:06:45.931
HAVE THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME

02:06:45.998 --> 02:06:47.199
BUT JUST FOR A POINT OF

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:50.903
REFERENCE IF YOU SIMPLY RAISED --

02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:53.405
RATES ON THOSE MAKING OVER TWO

02:06:53.472 --> 02:06:54.073
HUNDRED THOUSAND SO THAT THAT IS

02:06:54.139 --> 02:06:56.008
GETTING INTO THE UPPER ECHELONS

02:06:56.075 --> 02:06:57.276
YOU WOULD ONLY NEED TO RAISE THE

02:06:57.343 --> 02:07:00.112
RATE BY POINT 22% TO GET A

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:01.547
BILLION DOLLARS [inaudible]

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:04.016
IN REVENUE.

02:07:04.083 --> 02:07:05.150
IF AT I'LL BE VERY GLAD I'M NOT

02:07:05.217 --> 02:07:06.752
GONNA SPEAK TO TAX AND REVENUE

02:07:06.819 --> 02:07:07.586
SIDE.

BUT ALMOST BIG TO TWO THINGS ONE

02:07:10.389 --> 02:07:11.657
BLOCK OF HEALTH COMMITTEE I WANT.

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:13.092
TO COVERED CALIFORNIA IS A

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:15.160
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OF THE

02:07:15.227 --> 02:07:15.761
INDIVIDUAL MARKET IT'S IT'S

02:07:15.828 --> 02:07:16.795
REALLY COOL WE TALK ABOUT WHAT

THEIR ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:21.266

THERE BY OUR BENEFIT DESIGN WE

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:29.008
NEGOTIATE OUR PRICES AND DAY

02:07:29.074 --> 02:07:30.609
BENEFIT THERE THE ABOUT THE FOUR

02:07:30.676 --> 02:07:31.777
HUNDRED UP ONE NUMBER --

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:33.178
TWO YOUR OBSERVATION ABOUT

02:07:33.245 --> 02:07:34.480
HEALTHIER IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:37.249
IN SOME WAYS WE CARE MORE ABOUT.

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:38.751
THAT PERSON MY AGE.

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:40.652

THINK I CAN MAKE AND THAT'S

02:07:56.368 --> 02:07:57.703
ABOUTFORMULA THAT THE FINAL

02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:58.737
THING.

02:07:58.804 --> 02:08:01.306
THAT I KNOW IS --

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.941

AND HAVING THIS PART OF THE

02:08:18.957 --> 02:08:22.461
MARKET BE STABLE IS PART OF THE

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:23.495
BENEFITS THE ENTIRE COLUMN.

THAT A LOT OF QUESTIONS A VERY

02:08:38.477 --> 02:08:39.611
GOOD ANSWER BUT I DO HAVE A

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:42.047
COUPLE OF A COUPLE IN ITS FIRST --

ON SOME LEVEL THOSE SAVINGS ARE

02:09:01.867 --> 02:09:04.703
AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION ACROSS.

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:06.738
THE STATE'S BUDGET AND IN THE

02:09:06.805 --> 02:09:08.907
PAST THERE HAS BEEN A CONNECTION

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:10.576
MADE BETWEEN.

02:09:10.642 --> 02:09:12.077
THE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS IN

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:37.102
IT'S NOT REALLY ALLOCATED TO ANY

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:38.470
PARTICULAR PLACES JUST SPREAD

02:09:38.537 --> 02:09:40.606
ACROSS THE BUDGET IT ALLOWS THE

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:43.108
STATE TO DO --

02:09:43.175 --> 02:09:45.010
MORE EXPENDITURES IN THAT AMOUNT.

02:09:45.077 --> 02:09:46.912
SO THAT WOULD LEAD ME TO MY

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:48.981
QUESTION TO MR MILLER.

02:09:49.047 --> 02:09:50.782
IT'S CLEAR IN THE BUDGET

02:09:50.849 --> 02:09:53.085
PROPOSAL THAT THE MCO TAXES NOT

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:54.419
BEING CONSIDERED FOR RENEWAL

02:09:54.486 --> 02:09:56.255
CONSIDERING THE ONE POINT FIVE

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:57.723
BILLION DOLLAR POTENTIAL HERE

02:09:57.789 --> 02:09:59.591
ACROSS THE GENERAL FUND.

02:09:59.658 --> 02:10:01.093
ALSO CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.861
MANDATE MONEY SHOULD IT SHOULD

02:10:02.928 --> 02:10:04.463
WE PASS A MANDATE WILL BE

02:10:04.530 --> 02:10:05.464
DELAYED.

02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:06.965
YOU'RE POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT A

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:08.600
TWO BILLION DOLLAR [inaudible]

02:10:08.667 --> 02:10:10.536
HIT HERE.

02:10:10.602 --> 02:10:11.670
IS THE ADMINISTRATION

02:10:11.737 --> 02:10:14.406
CONSIDERING THE MCO TAX AND AND

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:18.443
IF NOT WHY NOT.

02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:19.111
WELL AS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT PART

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:20.379
OF THE PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME WE

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:21.613
CONTINUE TO LISTEN FROM

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.649
STAKEHOLDERS AND IN THE IN THE

02:10:23.715 --> 02:10:24.850
MAY REVISE WE MAY HAVE A

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:28.353
PROPOSAL --

02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:29.521
I I BELIEVE TO MISTER WILL THESE

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:31.990
POINT OF ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE

02:10:32.057 --> 02:10:33.392
AT MCO TAXES TO DRIVE DOWN

02:10:33.458 --> 02:10:34.893
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DOLLARS IN

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.461
THOSE DOLLARS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:39.598
IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM --

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:40.699
ONE OF THINGS INITIALS WE ALSO

02:10:40.766 --> 02:10:44.570
MENTIONED EARLIER WAS THE THE

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:46.171
IDEA THAT.

02:10:46.238 --> 02:10:48.473
BECAUSE OF THE SOME OF THE

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:51.076
CHALLENGES OF I'LL OF HAVING THE

02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:54.313
ONLY REVENUE IN A SPECIAL FUND --

02:10:54.379 --> 02:10:54.580
THE LA --

02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:56.615
SUGGESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:10:56.682 --> 02:10:58.183
AND THE FUNDED OUT OF THE

02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:59.651
GENERAL FUND INSTEAD. ONE THING

02:10:59.718 --> 02:11:00.986
I THINK WE WOULD POINT TO IS

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:03.455
THAT YOU THEN ALSO HAVE THESE

02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:05.224
KINDS OF CHALLENGES THE MISTER

02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:06.925
WILL DELUDE TO WHAT THE MCL TAX

02:11:06.992 --> 02:11:08.460
THAT IS --

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:10.362
IT'S DIFFICULT IN THE GENERAL

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:12.231
FUND TO REALLY SAY WHAT THOSE

02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:14.132
DOLLARS ARE BEING USED --

02:11:14.199 --> 02:11:15.601
FOR AND AND AND WITH REGARD TO

02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:16.902
THIS PROGRAM IT WOULD BE

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:18.303
SIMILARLY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:20.372
THE PENALTY REVENUES ARE GOING

02:11:20.439 --> 02:11:22.241
FOR HOW MUCH IS YOU KNOW GOING

02:11:22.307 --> 02:11:24.109
TO BE USED FOR ONE THING OR

02:11:24.176 --> 02:11:25.344
ANOTHER ANYWAY --

02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:26.578
BUT I I GUESS MY POINT IS IS

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:28.247
BEING USED SOMEWHERE SO WE HAVE

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:29.848
A WE'RE GONNA HAVE POTENTIAL ONE

02:11:29.915 --> 02:11:31.617
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR LESS

02:11:31.683 --> 02:11:32.684
IT'S GOING TO BE USED.

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:34.219
ADD UP AND POTENTIAL IF WE ARE

02:11:34.286 --> 02:11:36.021
ABLE -- TO

02:11:36.088 --> 02:11:37.522
IF WE HAVE THE MANDATE --

02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:38.857
MONEY COMING IT'S STILL GONNA

02:11:38.924 --> 02:11:40.025
THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE A LAG SO

02:11:40.092 --> 02:11:41.493
THERE'S ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.995
MILLION DOLLARS POTENTIAL TWO

02:11:43.061 --> 02:11:44.696
BILLION DOLLARS HERE.

02:11:44.763 --> 02:11:45.530
THAT.

02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:48.000
WE WE ONLY HAVE SO BIG SURPLUS

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:49.868
SO -- AND I

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:51.403
GUESS FOR ME LEAVING FEDERAL

02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:53.338
MONEY ON THE TABLE --

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:54.806
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:11:54.873 --> 02:11:56.675
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SO SO I

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:58.677
GUESS I'M ONE ECHO --

02:11:58.744 --> 02:12:01.880
DOCTOR ARAMBULA WE WOULD REALLY

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:02.814
LIKE YOU TO TO TWO BILLION

DOLLAR A LOT OF MONEY AND AND

02:12:07.519 --> 02:12:08.987
ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT THERE'S

02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:10.389
FEDERAL MONEY OUT THAT WE

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:10.989
POTENTIALLY MIGHT LEAVE ON THE

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:13.892
TABLE.

02:12:13.959 --> 02:12:15.527
ANYWAY I KIND OF THAT I WILL AND

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:17.062
AND THEN MY FINAL QUICK MY FINAL

02:12:17.129 --> 02:12:18.697
THING IS NOT A QUESTION BUT A

02:12:18.764 --> 02:12:21.433
COMMENT MORE OR LESS --

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:23.602

OF A NEW COSTA INCREASES OF

02:12:28.707 --> 02:12:30.075
HEALTH CARE IN GENERAL.

02:12:30.142 --> 02:12:33.478
BEING AT 5% ROUGHLY A WHEN YOU

CONSIDER INFLATION BEING WELL

02:12:36.348 --> 02:12:38.083
BELOW THAT.

IT GOES BACK TO MY ORIGINAL CON.

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:40.352

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:41.920
FIND A WAY AROUND COST

02:12:41.987 --> 02:12:43.188
CONTAINMENT HERE WE CAN'T THIS

02:12:43.255 --> 02:12:45.657
IS UNSUSTAINABLE UNSUSTAINABLE

02:12:45.724 --> 02:12:48.360
GOING FORWARD SO ANYWAY I WILL.

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:49.428
LEAVE IT AT THAT AT THIS POINT

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:53.865

AND HOW CALIFORNIA CAN IMPLEMENT

OFFICE --

02:13:17.823 --> 02:13:18.557
FOR THIS PANEL I WILL BE

02:13:18.623 --> 02:13:19.191
PROVIDED SOME HIGH LEVEL

02:13:19.257 --> 02:13:21.326
COMMENTS ABOUT SOME --

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:23.295
CONCEPTUAL WAYS THAT IN

02:13:23.362 --> 02:13:24.730
PARTICULAR PREMIUM ASSISTANCE

02:13:24.796 --> 02:13:26.798
COULD BE --

02:13:26.865 --> 02:13:27.099
PROVIDED --

02:13:27.165 --> 02:13:31.269
CONTINUE NINE OF OUR HAND OUT WE

02:13:31.336 --> 02:13:33.472
HIGHLIGHT AND THREE POTENTIAL

02:13:33.538 --> 02:13:35.040
CONCEPTS THE FIRST.

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:37.142
IS A REFUNDABLE ADVANCE OF ALL

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:38.977
TAX CREDIT ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:40.779
THAT WOULD BE MODELED AFTER THE

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:42.547
FEDERAL ADVANCE PREMIUM TAX

02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:43.782
CREDIT --

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:45.183
JUST TO BRIEFLY RUN THROUGH HOW

02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:47.018
THIS WOULD WORK AND FOR EXAMPLE

02:13:47.085 --> 02:13:48.487
COVER CALIFORNIA COULD.

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:51.323
ESTIMATE HOW MUCH STATE --

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:52.858
CREDIT A PERSON WOULD BE

02:13:52.924 --> 02:13:54.459
ELIGIBLE FOR THE BEGINNING OF

02:13:54.526 --> 02:13:55.961
THE YEAR BEFORE COVERAGE STARTS.

02:13:56.027 --> 02:13:57.596
AND THEN THE CONSUMER COULD HAVE

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:59.064
THE OPTION TO ADVANCE SOME OR

02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:00.832
ALL OF THAT TO IMMEDIATELY

02:14:00.899 --> 02:14:02.868
REDUCE THEIR PREMIUMS THAT THEY

02:14:02.934 --> 02:14:03.402
PAY EVERY MONTH.

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:04.669
AND THEN --

02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:07.906
AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THEY

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:09.608
FILE THEIR TAXES THEY WOULD.

02:14:09.674 --> 02:14:10.842
FIND OUT HOW MUCH THEY WERE

02:14:10.909 --> 02:14:12.677
ULTIMATELY ELIGIBLE FOR IF THEY

02:14:12.744 --> 02:14:14.479
HAD CREDIT THAT WASN'T ADVANCE

02:14:14.546 --> 02:14:15.947
THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED --

02:14:16.014 --> 02:14:17.849
AS A REDUCTION IN THEIR TAX BILL

02:14:17.916 --> 02:14:19.251
OR REFUND.

02:14:19.317 --> 02:14:21.052
AND IF --

02:14:21.119 --> 02:14:22.521
THEY ACTUALLY WOUND UP BEING

02:14:22.587 --> 02:14:23.855
ELIGIBLEFOR LESS CREDIT THAN

02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:25.524
THEY HAD ADVANCED THEY WOULD

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:26.858
THEN HAVE TO MAKE A PAYMENT.

02:14:26.925 --> 02:14:28.727
AS PART OF OUR TAXES TO TRUE

02:14:28.794 --> 02:14:29.928
THAT UP.

02:14:29.995 --> 02:14:32.831
ANOTHER CONCEPT IS TO DO A

02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:35.066
REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT THAT WOULD

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:36.101
NOT BE ADVANCE BOWL.

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:37.702
SO IN THIS CASE --

02:14:37.769 --> 02:14:40.939
THE INDIVIDUAL BE ABLE TO

02:14:41.006 --> 02:14:42.107
ADVANCE THE ASSISTANCE TO

02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:44.676
IMMEDIATELY REDUCE THEIR MONTHLY

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:46.478
PREMIUMS UP FRONT BUT WHAT

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:47.612
INSTEAD.

02:14:47.679 --> 02:14:49.181
PAY THE FULL PREMIUM AND WOULD

02:14:49.247 --> 02:14:50.482
THEN -- BE

02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:52.117
ABLE TO CLAIM THE CREDIT.

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:54.319
AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN

02:14:54.386 --> 02:14:56.388
THEIR FATHER TAXES.

02:14:56.455 --> 02:14:58.657
A THIRD CONCEPT AND IS SOMETHING

02:14:58.723 --> 02:14:59.991
THAT IS USED IN SOME OTHER

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:01.193
STATES WHICH IS.

02:15:01.259 --> 02:15:03.895
A UP FRONT SUBSIDY THAT IS FULLY

02:15:03.962 --> 02:15:06.231
ADVANCED TO INSURERS TO

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:07.365
IMMEDIATELY REDUCE MONTHLY

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:08.800
PREMIUMS.

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:10.335
BUT WOULD NOT BE RECONCILED

02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:11.770
THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM AT THE

02:15:11.837 --> 02:15:13.104
END OF THE YEAR SON THIS SINCE

02:15:13.171 --> 02:15:15.273
IT'S NOT A TAX CREDIT.

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:16.741
LIKE THE OTHER TWO OPTIONS.

02:15:16.808 --> 02:15:19.578
AND THESE THREE CONCEPTS AND

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:21.146
WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT

02:15:21.213 --> 02:15:23.482
IMPLICATIONS FOR IT THE STATE'S

02:15:23.548 --> 02:15:25.617
ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY

02:15:25.684 --> 02:15:28.887
[inaudible] FOR THE STATE'S

02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:30.755
APPROACH TO PROGRAM INTEGRITY

02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:32.390
VERIFYING INFORMATION THAT

02:15:32.457 --> 02:15:33.892
HOUSEHOLDS PROVIDE IN MAKING

02:15:33.959 --> 02:15:35.494
SURE THAT THAT ASSISTANCE IS

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.128
GOING WHERE IT SHOULD.

02:15:37.195 --> 02:15:39.464
AND ALSO FOR THE LEVEL OF NEW

02:15:39.531 --> 02:15:41.333
ENROLLMENTS IN COVERAGE THAT

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:42.300
THAT THEY MIGHT INDUCE THEN I'LL

02:15:42.367 --> 02:15:43.635
JUST WALK THROUGH.

02:15:43.702 --> 02:15:45.971
HOW THESE THREE CONCEPTS COULD

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:47.873
BE DIFFERENT ON THOSE DIMENSIONS?

02:15:47.939 --> 02:15:49.040
FOR THE REFUNDABLE ADVANCE WILL

02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:50.775
TAX CREDIT THAT WOULD BE MODELED

02:15:50.842 --> 02:15:51.977
ON A PTC.

02:15:52.043 --> 02:15:54.379
THIS WOULD CREATE NEW WORKLOAD

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:55.447
FOR COVER CALIFORNIA

02:15:55.514 --> 02:15:57.415
SPECIFICALLY AS I SAID BEFORE

02:15:57.482 --> 02:15:58.483
ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF

02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:59.484
ASSISTANCE.

02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:01.953
AND THEN ALLOWING AND CONSUMERS

02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:03.655
TO ADVANCE THAT TO ENSURE IS

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:04.956
THAT THEY WOULD LIKE --

02:16:05.023 --> 02:16:06.224
COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD LIKELY

02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:09.127
ALSO ENGAGE IN ON GOING --

02:16:09.194 --> 02:16:10.662
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNT OF

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:12.831
ADVANCED ASSISTANCE --

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:14.466
TO REFLECT CHANGES IN HOUSEHOLD

02:16:14.533 --> 02:16:16.234
SITUATIONS THIS WOULD BE AND

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:20.705
PART. TO LIMIT THE EXTENT CAME

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:21.306
IN WITH THEIR TAXES AT THE END

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:24.209
OF THE YEAR --

02:16:24.276 --> 02:16:26.111
THIS OPTION WILL ALSO CREATE

02:16:26.177 --> 02:16:28.213
SUBSTANTIAL NEW RESPONSIBILITIES

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:29.714
FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD.

02:16:29.781 --> 02:16:32.551
AND WHICH WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE --

02:16:32.617 --> 02:16:33.818
FOR THE RECONCILIATION PART OF

02:16:33.885 --> 02:16:34.719
THIS THIS WOULD INVOLVE

02:16:34.786 --> 02:16:36.521
SIGNIFICANT INTEGRATION AND DATA

02:16:36.588 --> 02:16:39.157
SHARING WITH OTHER AGENCIES --

02:16:39.224 --> 02:16:40.492
FRANCHISE TAX WHERE WE NEED TO

02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:42.594
KNOW HOW MUCH --

02:16:42.661 --> 02:16:43.662
CREDIT WAS ADVANCED.

02:16:43.728 --> 02:16:46.231
AND INTO WHO AND THEN AND THEN

02:16:46.298 --> 02:16:48.033
WHAT WOULD NEED TO WORK THROUGH

02:16:48.099 --> 02:16:49.768
THAT PROCESS OF OF PROCESSING

02:16:49.834 --> 02:16:52.337
REFUNDS WERE NECESSARY IN MAKING

02:16:52.404 --> 02:16:54.439
SURE THAT'S ALL RECONCILED --

02:16:54.506 --> 02:16:55.240
FOR PROGRAM INTEGRITY IN

02:16:55.307 --> 02:16:56.575
VERIFYING INFORMATION THAT

02:16:56.641 --> 02:16:59.110
PEOPLE RECEIVE --

02:16:59.177 --> 02:17:01.246
IT'S LIKELY THAT --

02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:02.914
COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ABLE

02:17:02.981 --> 02:17:04.783
TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE SAME

02:17:04.849 --> 02:17:06.551
PROCESSES THAT ARE USED FOR THE

02:17:06.618 --> 02:17:08.086
ADVANCED PLAN TAX CREDIT --

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:10.455
SPECIFICALLY VERIFYING HOUSEHOLD

02:17:10.522 --> 02:17:12.190
INFORMATION AGAINST ELECTRONIC

02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:14.793
DATA SOURCES --

02:17:14.859 --> 02:17:16.494
AND THOSE SAME PROCESSES COULD

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:18.129
BE USED FOR ADJUSTING THE

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:20.865
CREDITS THROUGH THE YEAR --

02:17:20.932 --> 02:17:22.968
AND THEN AS ITS TAX CREDIT AND

02:17:23.034 --> 02:17:24.402
THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE WOULD

02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:26.504
BE TIED TO THE INCOME THAT'S

02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:28.607
REPORTED ON TAX FROM SO THAT'S

02:17:28.673 --> 02:17:29.074
AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF

02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:30.208
VERIFICATION.

02:17:30.275 --> 02:17:33.278
IN TERMS OF NEW ENROLLMENT IN

02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:34.879
HEALTH COVERAGE --

02:17:34.946 --> 02:17:37.015
IT'S LIKELY THAT RECEIVING THE

02:17:37.082 --> 02:17:38.984
ASSISTANCE UP FRONT AS A AN

02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:40.518
ADVANCED --

02:17:40.585 --> 02:17:42.787
CREDIT WOULD RESULT IN A

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.122
RELATIVELY GREATER IMPACT ON NEW

02:17:44.189 --> 02:17:45.490
ROMAN BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD BE

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:48.159
ABLE TO ACT ON HAVING THOSE

02:17:48.226 --> 02:17:50.829
LOWER COSTS IMMEDIATELY. FOR THE

02:17:50.895 --> 02:17:52.797
SECOND CONCEPT A REFUNDABLE NON

02:17:52.864 --> 02:17:53.665
INVENCIBLE TAX CREDIT.

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:56.701
AND THIS WOULD NOT --

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:58.803
NECESSARILY RESULT IN

02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:00.772
SIGNIFICANT NEW WORKERS RECOVER

02:18:00.839 --> 02:18:02.007
CALIFORNIA.

02:18:02.073 --> 02:18:02.741
THEY WOULD BE INVOLVED WITH

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.309
CERTIFYING THAT IN A HOUSEHOLD

02:18:04.376 --> 02:18:05.677
PURCHASE COVERAGE AND THAT THAT

02:18:05.744 --> 02:18:06.611
MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

02:18:06.678 --> 02:18:07.545
CREDIT THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE A

02:18:07.612 --> 02:18:09.214
NEED TO ESTIMATE THINGS

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.615
NECESSARILY ADVANCE ALTHOUGH.

02:18:10.682 --> 02:18:11.249
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:14.185
LOOKED AT AND JUST AS A TO GIVE

02:18:14.252 --> 02:18:14.853
HOUSEHOLDS --

02:18:14.919 --> 02:18:16.321
HEADS UP THAT THEY MIGHT BE

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:17.589
ELIGIBLE FOR SOMETHING --

02:18:17.656 --> 02:18:20.859
BUT IT IT WOULD STILL RESULT IN

02:18:20.925 --> 02:18:22.527
AB IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE LESS

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:24.229
INVOLVED BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE

02:18:24.295 --> 02:18:25.497
WOULDN'T BE THE NEED TO READ AND

02:18:25.563 --> 02:18:26.464
GET INFORMATION ABOUT ADVANCED

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:28.533
CREDITS BUT THERE IS STILL BE A

02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:29.901
LOT OF WORKLOAD FOR FTP.

02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:31.736
THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR --

02:18:31.803 --> 02:18:33.171
TO OTHER REFUNDABLE.

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:34.973
TAX CREDITS FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:37.275
STATE HAS A REFUNDABLE EARNED

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:38.443
INCOME TAX CREDIT.

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:39.944
AND FOR PROGRAM INTEGRITY YOU

02:18:40.011 --> 02:18:40.879
WOULD HAVE THE VERIFICATION

02:18:40.945 --> 02:18:43.548
THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM.

02:18:43.615 --> 02:18:46.084
AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THIS

02:18:46.151 --> 02:18:47.786
OPTION IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A

02:18:47.852 --> 02:18:50.055
RELATIVELY MORE LIMITED A FACT

02:18:50.121 --> 02:18:51.423
ON NEW ENROLLMENT.

02:18:51.489 --> 02:18:53.091
BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD NOT

02:18:53.158 --> 02:18:55.126
NECESSARILY SEE THAT REDUCTION

02:18:55.193 --> 02:18:57.028
IN THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:57.996
PREMIUMS UP FRONT THEY WOULD

02:18:58.063 --> 02:19:00.131
HAVE TO ESSENTIALLY FRONT THAT

02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:01.633
MONEY PAY THE FULL PREMIUM.

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:03.068
IN ANTICIPATION OF RECEIVING A

02:19:03.134 --> 02:19:04.169
REFUND AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO

02:19:04.235 --> 02:19:06.037
WE WOULD EXPECT RELATIVELY MORE

02:19:06.104 --> 02:19:09.040
LIMITED --

02:19:09.107 --> 02:19:11.209
CHANGES KNOWN ROLAND. FOR THE

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:12.210
FINAL --

02:19:12.277 --> 02:19:15.080
CONCEPT AND SIMILAR TO SOMETHING

02:19:15.146 --> 02:19:16.681
BASED ON THE PTC COVER

02:19:16.748 --> 02:19:18.650
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ESTIMATING --

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:22.053
CREDIT AMOUNTS WOULD BE UPDATING --

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:23.221
SIR NOT CREDIT NOT SUBSIDY

02:19:23.288 --> 02:19:24.255
AMOUNTS WOULD BE.

02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:25.590
UPDATING SAID THE AMOUNTS

02:19:25.657 --> 02:19:27.926
THROUGH THE YEAR AND AND A PTZ

02:19:27.992 --> 02:19:29.227
PROCESSES COULD PROBABLY BE

02:19:29.294 --> 02:19:30.628
LEVERAGE FOR THAT.

02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:31.930
BUT THIS WOULD NOT RESULT IN NEW

02:19:31.996 --> 02:19:35.567
WORKLOAD BOARD AND SINCE THERE

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:37.001
WOULD BE NO END OF YEAR

02:19:37.068 --> 02:19:38.536
RECONCILIATION.

02:19:38.603 --> 02:19:39.904
AND AS FAR AS PROGRAM INTEGRITY

02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:43.208
GOES THIS OPTION WOULD LACK THE

02:19:43.274 --> 02:19:44.976
FINAL RECONCILIATION THROUGH THE

02:19:45.043 --> 02:19:46.611
INCOME TAX SYSTEM WHICH MEANS

02:19:46.678 --> 02:19:47.212
THAT.

02:19:47.278 --> 02:19:48.713
SOME HOUSEHOLDS COULD WIND UP

02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:50.048
WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE OR A

02:19:50.115 --> 02:19:51.583
LITTLE BIT LESS ASSISTANCE

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:52.751
OVERALL THROUGH THE YEAR THAN

02:19:52.817 --> 02:19:53.785
THEY WOULD HAVE.

02:19:53.852 --> 02:19:55.286
IF THERE HAD BEEN THAT FINAL

02:19:55.353 --> 02:19:57.388
VERIFICATION --

02:19:57.455 --> 02:19:59.290
THIS WOULD TAKE ON PARTICULAR

02:19:59.357 --> 02:20:00.859
SIGNIFICANCE IF THE AMOUNTS OF

02:20:00.925 --> 02:20:03.561
THE ASSISTANCE WERE WERE LARGE

02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:06.164
AS OPPOSED TO RELATIVELY SMALL --

02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:07.565
AND FINALLY THIS WOULD HAVE

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:09.100
SIMILAR EFFECTS ON NEW

02:20:09.167 --> 02:20:11.269
ENROLLMENT AS AND A B. T. C.

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:13.471
LIKE OPTION WHERE THE ASSISTANCE

02:20:13.538 --> 02:20:14.706
IS PROVIDED UP FRONT.

02:20:14.773 --> 02:20:16.207
ULTIMATELY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:17.208
NEED -- TO

02:20:17.275 --> 02:20:18.943
AWAY THE TRADE OFFS PRESENTED BY

02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:20.578
THESE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS.

02:20:20.645 --> 02:20:22.781
AND AND DETERMINE WHICH OPTION

02:20:22.847 --> 02:20:27.385
BEST ALIGNS WITH ITS PRIORITIES.

02:20:27.452 --> 02:20:27.986
AND THAT'S ALL THE COMMENTS I

02:20:28.052 --> 02:20:32.724
HAVE ON THIS ISSUE.

02:20:32.791 --> 02:20:33.258
GREAT -- SO.

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:34.492
THAT [inaudible]

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:37.462
FIRST THE THE REPORT WE PROVIDED

02:20:37.529 --> 02:20:38.696
OUTLINED IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS

02:20:38.763 --> 02:20:39.898
A COUPLE THINGS IS TO STATE THE

02:20:39.964 --> 02:20:40.431
OBVIOUS.

02:20:40.498 --> 02:20:41.199
THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:42.834
POLICY AN OPERATIONAL ISSUES FOR

02:20:42.901 --> 02:20:44.369
IN PARTICULAR --

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:46.638
COVER CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX

02:20:46.704 --> 02:20:48.773
BOARD DEPEND ON THE POLICIES.

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.141
IN FOR HELP PLANTS [inaudible]

02:20:50.208 --> 02:20:51.643
THAT SAID.

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:52.877
THE PATHWAY TO MAKE THINGS

02:20:52.944 --> 02:20:54.546
DOABLE TO ACT QUICKLY IS TO

02:20:54.612 --> 02:20:56.815
BUILD ON EXISTING STRUCTURES

02:20:56.881 --> 02:20:58.082
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO

02:20:58.149 --> 02:20:59.551
THE EXTENT ANY POLICY OPTIONS

02:20:59.617 --> 02:21:00.285
WERE.

02:21:00.351 --> 02:21:02.220
DIFFERENT MORE VARIED IT WOULD

02:21:02.287 --> 02:21:04.722
MULTIPLY DRAMATICALLY BOTH THE

02:21:04.789 --> 02:21:07.091
COMPLEXITY INVITATIONAL JUST

02:21:07.158 --> 02:21:09.227
SUCH AS AN OVERALL COMMENT --

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:11.529
I THINK THE REVIEW YOU HEARD I

02:21:11.596 --> 02:21:13.198
THINK IT'S AGREE WITH VIRTUALLY

02:21:13.264 --> 02:21:14.432
EVERYTHING NOTED ALSO HIGHLIGHT

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:15.934
A COUPLE ELEMENTS.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:16.901
IS FIRST --

02:21:16.968 --> 02:21:21.906
BUT GIVEN THE VARIOUS TOOLS

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:22.540
OUTLINED IN A REPORT OF A COMMON

02:21:22.607 --> 02:21:24.709
ON EACH [inaudible]

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:25.677
PREMIUM SUBSIDIES.

02:21:25.743 --> 02:21:26.744
THE BIG ISSUE IS A DANCEABLE

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:28.012
VERSES REFUNDABLE THE REPORT

02:21:28.079 --> 02:21:31.349
ENTIRELY LOOKS AT ADVANCE OF ALL.

02:21:31.416 --> 02:21:32.016
END NOTES --

02:21:32.083 --> 02:21:33.551
IN THE REPORT OF LIMITATION IF

02:21:33.618 --> 02:21:34.752
THE INSTEAD THIS IS WHERE TO

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:37.021
MAKE THESE REFUNDABLE DISCOUNT

02:21:37.088 --> 02:21:38.723
DRAMATICALLY THE ENROLLMENT IT

02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:40.859
IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR BY ANY

02:21:40.925 --> 02:21:42.327
ECONOMICS OUT THERE THAT.

02:21:42.393 --> 02:21:45.663
THE YOU SAY YOU PUT MONEY UP

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.365
FRONT AND YOU GET IT BACK LATER.

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:49.067
THAT WOULD NOT BENEFIT LOWER

02:21:49.133 --> 02:21:50.602
INCOME PEOPLE AND HIGHER INCOME

02:21:50.668 --> 02:21:52.737
PEOPLE EVEN THEY WOULD BE LESS

02:21:52.804 --> 02:21:54.706
APT TO USE IT SO YOU THE WAS ON

02:21:54.772 --> 02:21:56.741
THE IMPLEMENTATION SIDE --

02:21:56.808 --> 02:21:58.910
THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN

02:21:58.977 --> 02:22:01.079
PLACE ROBUST VERIFICATION

02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:02.914
PROCESSES THAT WE COULD CLICK

02:22:02.981 --> 02:22:05.350
THE SWITCH AND DO THAT FOR ABOUT --

02:22:05.416 --> 02:22:07.185
FOUR HUNDRED INCLUDING UPDATES

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:08.653
ON CHAINS OF INCOME.

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.788
PUTTING IN PLACE RECONCILIATION

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:11.756
PROCESSES --

02:22:11.823 --> 02:22:13.324
WOULD TAKE MORE TIME --

02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:14.325
AND WOULD BE A MORE SIGNIFICANT

02:22:14.392 --> 02:22:16.527
BURDEN FOR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD

02:22:16.594 --> 02:22:19.297
OR FOR COVER CALIFORNIA --

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:21.633
ON COST SHARING OF ONE OF THE

02:22:21.699 --> 02:22:23.001
REASONS.

02:22:23.067 --> 02:22:24.502
TO SHARE WITH YOU EARLIER THE

02:22:24.569 --> 02:22:26.237
DIFFERENT STRUCTURE THE COST

02:22:26.304 --> 02:22:28.106
SHARING STRUCTURES IS --

02:22:28.172 --> 02:22:29.774
IF.

02:22:29.841 --> 02:22:32.176
SUPPORT FOR EXPANDED COST

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:34.045
HEARING WAS BUILT ON EXISTING

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:35.914
STRUCTURES.

02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:37.448
HEALTH PLANS COULD IMPLEMENT IT

02:22:37.515 --> 02:22:39.017
QUITE QUICKLY --

02:22:39.083 --> 02:22:40.585
WHICH MEANS IF YOU SAY WE'RE

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:42.754
GOING TO GIVE UP ADDITIONAL COST

02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:44.322
SHARING SUPPORT TO TAKE SOMEONE

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:45.857
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A SILVER

02:22:45.924 --> 02:22:47.392
PLAN TO A GOLD PLAN.

02:22:47.458 --> 02:22:49.227
PRETTY EASY TO DO BUT IF YOU'RE

02:22:49.294 --> 02:22:51.229
SAYING WE WANT TO GO TO A THING

02:22:51.296 --> 02:22:52.997
THAT DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW AND

02:22:53.064 --> 02:22:54.565
HAVE AN ACTUAL REAL VALUE OF

02:22:54.632 --> 02:22:55.934
EIGHTY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.036
WAY DIFFICULT SO THINK ABOUT THE

02:22:58.102 --> 02:22:59.671
STRUCTURES OF EXPANDING COST

02:22:59.737 --> 02:23:01.172
SHARING USING EXISTING

02:23:01.239 --> 02:23:03.741
STRUCTURES --

02:23:03.808 --> 02:23:04.776
ON THE PENALTY.

02:23:04.842 --> 02:23:07.612
THE CLEARLY THERE ARE ISSUES --

02:23:07.679 --> 02:23:09.213
EXPORT.

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:11.149
THERE'S ALSO ISSUES FOR POLICY

02:23:11.215 --> 02:23:12.717
MAKERS AND FOR US TO IMPLEMENT.

02:23:12.784 --> 02:23:14.419
TO THE EXTENT POLICIES ARE

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:15.887
DIFFERENT FROM THE FEDERAL

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:18.823
STANDARDS FOR WHO GETS A PENALTY

02:23:18.890 --> 02:23:19.490
HOW IT'S ADMINISTERED THE DOLLAR

02:23:19.557 --> 02:23:20.391
AMOUNTS.

02:23:20.458 --> 02:23:21.960
YOU'LL BE MORE COMPLEX BOTH TO

02:23:22.026 --> 02:23:24.128
ADMINISTER AND MORE COMPLEX IN

02:23:24.195 --> 02:23:25.330
THE EVENT.

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:27.465
THERE IS A RETURN TO THE FEDERAL

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:28.533
PENALTY.

02:23:28.599 --> 02:23:31.169
SO HAVING THINGS IN SYNC IS BOTH

02:23:31.235 --> 02:23:32.804
FASTER AND EASIER.

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:35.173
AND AGAIN I THINK MANY OF US

02:23:35.239 --> 02:23:35.840
THINK THERE MAY BE A DAY IN THE

02:23:35.907 --> 02:23:37.041
NOT DISTANT FUTURE WHEN THE

02:23:37.108 --> 02:23:38.676
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REINSTITUTE A

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:40.645
FEDERAL PENALTY SO THAT'S AN

02:23:40.712 --> 02:23:41.212
ISSUE ON THE A PETITION THE

02:23:41.279 --> 02:23:44.015
PENALTY --

02:23:44.082 --> 02:23:45.016
WE SPOKE ABOUT REINSURANCE.

02:23:45.083 --> 02:23:46.551
IF THE STATE WERE TO PURSUE

02:23:46.617 --> 02:23:48.152
REINSURANCE WOULD HAVE TO

02:23:48.219 --> 02:23:49.320
DEVELOP AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO

02:23:49.387 --> 02:23:49.787
WAIVER --

02:23:49.854 --> 02:23:52.090
THAT UNTO ITSELF IS A NOT

02:23:52.156 --> 02:23:54.425
INSUBSTANTIAL PROJECT --

02:23:54.492 --> 02:23:55.026
TO OBTAIN THE FEDERAL OFFSET

02:23:55.093 --> 02:23:56.894
FUNDING AND IT WOULD BE SUBJECT

02:23:56.961 --> 02:23:58.296
TO THE FEDERAL REVIEW OF THAT

02:23:58.363 --> 02:23:59.831
WAIVER PROPOSAL WITH

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:01.232
UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO WHAT

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:03.468
THAT GOT --

02:24:03.534 --> 02:24:04.869
IN TERMS THE STATE AGENCY

02:24:04.936 --> 02:24:08.006
RESPONSIBILITIES AGAIN THE I

02:24:08.072 --> 02:24:10.508
NOTED THAT THE TWO THE ENTITIES

02:24:10.575 --> 02:24:11.743
THAT WOULD BE MOST IMPACT WOULD

02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:13.344
BE COVERED CALIFORNIA --

02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:15.079
WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF BEING

02:24:15.146 --> 02:24:16.247
ABLE TO BE PRETTY NIMBLE.

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:18.149
THAT DOESN'T MEAN TURNING ON

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.117
ABSOLUTE DIME.

02:24:19.183 --> 02:24:20.218
ALTER WHAT TIME IS SECOND THE

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:22.053
OTHER WOULD BE THE FRANCHISE TAX

02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:23.388
BOARD -- THE

02:24:23.454 --> 02:24:25.490
OTHER ENTITIES IS HEALTH PLANS

02:24:25.556 --> 02:24:27.225
THEMSELVES.

02:24:27.291 --> 02:24:28.726
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT HEALTH

02:24:28.793 --> 02:24:28.960
PLANS.

02:24:29.027 --> 02:24:29.961
ARE ACTUALLY.

02:24:30.028 --> 02:24:33.164
STARTING PLANNING.

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:34.198
SO HEALTH PLENTY TO BE GIVEN

02:24:34.265 --> 02:24:35.933
SOME CERTAINTY --

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:36.868
IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS

02:24:36.934 --> 02:24:39.604
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.739
DEVELOP THEIR PRICES.

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:42.373
FOR TWENTY TWENTY SO THEY NEED

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:45.043
INSOFAR AS POLICIES WOULD.

02:24:45.109 --> 02:24:46.411
BE PUT IN PLACE TO AFFECT THEM

02:24:46.477 --> 02:24:48.379
FOR THE NEXT.

02:24:48.446 --> 02:24:50.915
PLAN YEAR OF THEY NEED THAT --

02:24:50.982 --> 02:24:53.484
BY SUMMER AND WE COULD TALK MORE

02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:54.419
ABOUT THE SPECIFIC TIME IN THE

02:24:54.485 --> 02:24:55.353
OTHER ENTITY THAT MIGHT BE

02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:56.954
AFFECTED DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE

02:24:57.021 --> 02:24:57.522
SERVICES MEDICAL.

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:58.990
BUT VERY IMPORTANT NOTE THAT ALL

02:24:59.057 --> 02:25:00.892
OF OUR ENROLLMENT PROCESSES ARE

02:25:00.958 --> 02:25:02.593
UNDER SOMETHING CALLED CAL

02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:03.461
HERE'S SOME OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR

02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:03.895
WITH.

02:25:03.961 --> 02:25:05.129
STERN YOU ARE FAMILIAR GILLARD

02:25:05.196 --> 02:25:06.030
ABOUT CAL HERE'S PART OF HEALTH

02:25:06.097 --> 02:25:08.699
COMMITTEE BUT ITS THE THE ON THE

02:25:08.766 --> 02:25:10.968
SYSTEM BY WHICH PEOPLE APPLY FOR

02:25:11.035 --> 02:25:12.036
FINANCIAL HELP.

02:25:12.103 --> 02:25:13.404
WHEN WE PEOPLE PEOPLE COME TO

02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:14.238
OUR DOOR THEY DON'T KNOW IF

02:25:14.305 --> 02:25:15.740
THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL OR

02:25:15.807 --> 02:25:17.141
COVER CALIFORNIA'S SUBS OR NOT?

02:25:17.208 --> 02:25:19.177
IT'S A COMMON SYSTEM WE SHARE

02:25:19.243 --> 02:25:20.611
WITH -- DHS

02:25:20.678 --> 02:25:22.747
FOR MEDICAL --

02:25:22.814 --> 02:25:25.850
IF WE ARE GOING TO NOT SOMETHING

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:27.685
THAT WAS IN OUR WORK PLAN.

02:25:27.752 --> 02:25:29.187
WE THINK WE CAN DO IT --

02:25:29.253 --> 02:25:31.322
BUT IT WOULD AFFECT PRIORITIES

02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:31.923
THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS

02:25:31.989 --> 02:25:32.356
THAT WOULD AFFECT.

02:25:32.423 --> 02:25:33.491
THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:35.059
SERVICES MEDI CAL AND THAT'S THE

02:25:35.126 --> 02:25:36.727
ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT

02:25:36.794 --> 02:25:38.196
TO THE OTHER IMPACTS ON TIMING

02:25:38.262 --> 02:25:39.430
OF LIMITATION.

02:25:39.497 --> 02:25:41.032
AS A STATE WE'VE SHOWN WE CAN BE

02:25:41.099 --> 02:25:43.534
NIMBLE MOVE FAST BUT THAT

02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:44.168
DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T RIPPLE

02:25:44.235 --> 02:25:45.436
EFFECTS [inaudible]

02:25:45.503 --> 02:25:47.371
THANK YOU.

02:25:47.438 --> 02:25:49.941
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES

02:25:50.007 --> 02:25:50.241
[inaudible]

02:25:50.308 --> 02:25:52.643
DR PAM.

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:54.979
ACTUALLY DID HAVE A QUESTION

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:56.147
WELL DIFFERENT AND WHAT BOTH OF

02:25:56.214 --> 02:25:57.381
YOU PERCENT ABOUT --

02:25:57.448 --> 02:25:59.083
SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT'S COME

02:25:59.150 --> 02:26:00.384
UP IN A CA FROM NATION

02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:02.520
NATIONALLY IS THE FAMILY GLITCH.

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:03.688
RIGHT.

02:26:03.754 --> 02:26:05.857
DO YOU SEE IN TERMS OF OUR OWN

02:26:05.923 --> 02:26:08.493
IMPLEMENTATION THAT --

02:26:08.559 --> 02:26:10.027
THINGS THAT WE MIGHT DO TO TRY

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:12.063
TO A DRESS THAT I MEAN WE TALK

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.197
ABOUT PROVIDING SOME OF THESE SO

02:26:13.264 --> 02:26:15.600
FORCE -- OF

02:26:15.666 --> 02:26:17.168
COURSE SO THE PRICE TAG OF THAT

02:26:17.235 --> 02:26:18.736
OF COURSE IS SOMETHING WE DON'T

02:26:18.803 --> 02:26:19.971
HAVE TO DISCUSS BUT NO WORDS

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:20.605
WERE HERE TRYING TO FIGURE HOW

02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:21.205
TO MAKE THINGS AFFORDABLE WE

02:26:21.272 --> 02:26:22.440
HAVE PEOPLE CAUGHT.

02:26:22.507 --> 02:26:24.408
IN THE FAMILY GLITCH THAT

02:26:24.475 --> 02:26:26.577
HAPPENED WITH THE NATIONAL EASE

02:26:26.644 --> 02:26:28.279
THE OVERALL ACA.

02:26:28.346 --> 02:26:32.116
SO MISTER THEM FOR NOW MY GUESS

02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:34.452
IS IN THE AUDIENCE. 17% OF

02:26:34.519 --> 02:26:35.620
PEOPLE NO THE GLITCH WELL THE

02:26:35.686 --> 02:26:36.420
OTHERS KNOW WHAT SORT OF OR

02:26:36.487 --> 02:26:36.888
DON'T KNOW WHAT --

02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:38.656
JUST TO REMIND YOU ALL WHAT THE

02:26:38.723 --> 02:26:39.857
FAMILY GLITCH IS.

02:26:39.924 --> 02:26:41.792
IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BAKED

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:43.594
INTO THE LAW.

02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:44.262
THERE'S INCOME STANDARD A WHEN

02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:45.329
YOU GET FINANCIAL HELP.

02:26:45.396 --> 02:26:46.797
HOWEVER THOSE INCOME STANDARDS

02:26:46.864 --> 02:26:49.967
HAVE A GLITCH RELATIVE TO IF ONE

02:26:50.034 --> 02:26:51.469
MEMBER OF A FAMILY HAS EMPLOYER

02:26:51.536 --> 02:26:53.004
BASED COVERAGE AND OTHER MEMBERS

02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:54.138
OF THE FAMILY DO NOT HAVE

02:26:54.205 --> 02:26:55.339
EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE THAT'S

02:26:55.406 --> 02:26:56.240
AFFORDABLE.

02:26:56.307 --> 02:26:57.808
THE STANDARD FOR DETERMINING HOW

02:26:57.875 --> 02:26:59.410
MUCH OF A SUBSIDY THEY'D GET

02:26:59.477 --> 02:27:00.511
ISN'T BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL

02:27:00.578 --> 02:27:01.913
AND ALL THE WHOLE FAMILY SO IT'S

02:27:01.979 --> 02:27:03.781
A IT IS A GLITCH IN THE LAW --

02:27:03.848 --> 02:27:05.449
WE DID NOT MODEL THOSE AYE WE

02:27:05.516 --> 02:27:07.652
ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE END IS TO

02:27:07.718 --> 02:27:08.519
THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE

02:27:08.586 --> 02:27:10.721
WAS GIVEN THE EXISTING STRUCTURE

02:27:10.788 --> 02:27:12.056
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHAT

02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:13.457
COULD WE DO IN CALIFORNIA.

02:27:13.524 --> 02:27:16.227
THE GLITCHES BAKED INTO THE ACA

02:27:16.294 --> 02:27:17.161
IS A WE CAN FALL THE TALK THE

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:19.964
MORE OFFLINE AND LOOK AT BUT

02:27:20.031 --> 02:27:20.498
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS

02:27:20.565 --> 02:27:20.998
RUNNING THE GOVERNOR.

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:23.334
SAID IN HIS LETTER TO CONGRESS

02:27:23.401 --> 02:27:25.169
IN DAY ONE IN OFFICE TO SAY.

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:26.871
GET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER SO TO

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:27.672
SPEAK.

02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:28.773
FIX THINGS THE AFFORDABLE CARE

02:27:28.839 --> 02:27:30.241
ACT INCLUDING THINGS YOU'RE

02:27:30.308 --> 02:27:31.075
LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IN

02:27:31.142 --> 02:27:33.377
CALIFORNIA THE FAMILY WHICH IS

02:27:33.444 --> 02:27:34.512
ONE OF THOSE.

02:27:34.579 --> 02:27:35.646
THANK YOU WELL CERTAINLY --

02:27:35.713 --> 02:27:36.614
IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S BAKED IN

02:27:36.681 --> 02:27:38.249
A NATIONAL I HOPE THERE'S

02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:40.885
FEDERAL ACTION ON THIS --

02:27:40.952 --> 02:27:42.920
I'M NOT TERRIBLY OPTIMISTIC AT

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:44.488
THE UNFORTUNATELY --

02:27:44.555 --> 02:27:45.656
BUT I WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT

02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:46.624
WELL WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:48.125
OPTIONS WE MIGHT HAVE TO AT

02:27:48.192 --> 02:27:50.428
LEAST MITIGATE SOME OF THAT --

02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:52.196
AS WERE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT

02:27:52.263 --> 02:27:53.664
AFFORDABILITY HERE IN OUR STATE.

02:27:53.731 --> 02:27:57.702
BUT I AGREE ULTIMATELY WE CAN'T

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:58.236
REALLY FIX IT HERE SB SIX

02:27:58.302 --> 02:27:59.237
FEDERALLY.

02:27:59.303 --> 02:28:00.238
IN IN SO FAR AS CALIFORNIA

02:28:00.304 --> 02:28:02.573
PROVIDES RICHER SUBSIDIES AT ANY

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:04.976
LEVEL UP PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:05.876
OTHERWISE AFFECT THE LET'S HAVE.

02:28:05.943 --> 02:28:07.078
MORE SUBSIDIES TO HELP SO TO

02:28:07.144 --> 02:28:08.846
SPEAK BUT IT'S STILL THE GLITZ

02:28:08.913 --> 02:28:10.381
DOESN'T GO AWAY IT'S JUST

02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:13.451
AMELIORATED SOME.

02:28:13.517 --> 02:28:17.521
THANK YOU OTHER COLLEAGUES.

02:28:17.588 --> 02:28:18.956
SEEING NONE I'D LIKE TO DRAW

02:28:19.023 --> 02:28:20.124
SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS THAT I

02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:22.026
THINK YOU'VE STATED BUT JUST

02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:23.761
WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE --

02:28:23.828 --> 02:28:25.796
CLEAR ON YOU BELIEVE IN BUILDING

02:28:25.863 --> 02:28:27.498
UPON THE EXISTING STRUCTURES OF

02:28:27.565 --> 02:28:28.699
THE ACA.

02:28:28.766 --> 02:28:30.234
AND THAT A REFUNDABLE ADVANCE

02:28:30.301 --> 02:28:31.936
BOWL TAX CREDIT WOULD BE MOST

02:28:32.003 --> 02:28:33.871
EFFECTIVE. TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:28:33.938 --> 02:28:35.606
WE'RE HELPING TO KEEP PREMIUMS

02:28:35.673 --> 02:28:38.109
DOWN THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

02:28:38.175 --> 02:28:40.911
DIRECTION THAT THE COMING

02:28:40.978 --> 02:28:46.584
CALIFORNIANS.

02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:48.552
BUT YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY JUST

02:28:48.619 --> 02:28:50.388
DEPENDS ON THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:28:50.454 --> 02:28:51.889
RELATIVE PRIORITIES FOR

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:54.659
COMPLEXITY VERSES --

02:28:54.725 --> 02:28:56.594
THE IMPACT ON ENROLLMENT VERSES

02:28:56.661 --> 02:28:59.530
AND OPPORTUNITIES TO VERIFY THE

02:28:59.597 --> 02:29:00.998
INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED AND

02:29:01.065 --> 02:29:02.433
THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS.

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.734
ARE STRONGER OR WEAKER ON THOSE

02:29:03.801 --> 02:29:05.269
DIFFERENT THINGS IF IF YOU WANT

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:07.171
TO EMPHASIZE --

02:29:07.238 --> 02:29:08.806
INCREASED ENROLLMENT THAN IT

02:29:08.873 --> 02:29:09.974
DOES APPEAR THAT IT WOULD BE

02:29:10.041 --> 02:29:11.275
CRITICAL TO PROVIDE THAT

02:29:11.342 --> 02:29:13.444
ASSISTANCE UP FRONT AS AN MISTER

02:29:13.511 --> 02:29:15.212
LEE MENTIONED --

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:16.781
ON THE OTHER HAND --

02:29:16.847 --> 02:29:18.149
YOU KNOW TRYING THINGS UP

02:29:18.215 --> 02:29:19.483
THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM COULD

02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:21.085
POTENTIALLY --

02:29:21.152 --> 02:29:23.120
PROVIDE SOME MARGINAL INCREASED

02:29:23.187 --> 02:29:24.588
PROGRAM INTEGRITY --

02:29:24.655 --> 02:29:25.723
BUT AGAIN IT'S GOING TO DEPEND

02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:27.291
ON THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDITS

02:29:27.358 --> 02:29:27.825
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

02:29:27.892 --> 02:29:29.860
WHETHER THAT SORT OF ADJUSTMENT

02:29:29.927 --> 02:29:31.495
IS IS WORTH IT.

02:29:31.562 --> 02:29:33.497
IN MAYBE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE

02:29:33.564 --> 02:29:35.566
TIME TO SAY WE CAN'T GET INTO

02:29:35.633 --> 02:29:37.735
THE SPECIFICS OF EACH OF THE

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:40.171
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT --

02:29:40.237 --> 02:29:43.341
US ON THE DíAS MAY BE OFFERING --

02:29:43.407 --> 02:29:45.176
CO AUTHORING.

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:45.743
BUT TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT A

02:29:45.810 --> 02:29:47.345
DOLLAR FIGURE IS NEEDED SO THAT

02:29:47.411 --> 02:29:49.180
WE CAN THEN WORK BACKWARDS TO

02:29:49.246 --> 02:29:50.448
FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF A SUBSIDY

02:29:50.514 --> 02:29:51.916
WE CAN PROVIDE.

02:29:51.982 --> 02:29:53.617
HOW MUCH OF A CARROT THERE IS

02:29:53.684 --> 02:29:55.052
AVAILABLE?

02:29:55.119 --> 02:29:57.088
IS NOT INHERENTLY DETERMINED BY

02:29:57.154 --> 02:29:59.090
WHAT TYPE OF PENALTY WE HAVE BUT

02:29:59.156 --> 02:30:01.158
RATHER WHAT WE WANT TO SEND THAT

02:30:01.225 --> 02:30:02.526
GOAL OUT THE FIRST YEAR.

02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:04.528
AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK

02:30:04.595 --> 02:30:06.564
WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:08.032
WE CAN HAVE THAT.

02:30:08.099 --> 02:30:09.900
DISCUSSION IN ADVANCE OF THE MAY

02:30:09.967 --> 02:30:11.402
REVISE WHICH IS COMING SO THAT

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:12.870
WE CAN --

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:15.539
MAKE SURE WERE --

02:30:15.606 --> 02:30:18.409
SUBSIDIES WE CAN.

02:30:18.476 --> 02:30:19.944
PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET.

02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:22.079
AND I KEEP COMING BACK TO YOUR

02:30:22.146 --> 02:30:24.582
POINT ABOUT 60% --

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:27.551
CPI GROWTH WITHIN HEALTH CARE.

02:30:27.618 --> 02:30:29.854

MEET THE EXPENSES OF HEALTH CARE.

02:30:35.659 --> 02:30:37.828
AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AS THE

02:30:37.895 --> 02:30:39.096
LEGISLATURE HOW TO BEND THE COST

02:30:39.163 --> 02:30:40.498

SUCH AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS

02:35:01.458 --> 02:35:03.293
ALTHOUGH WE WE WE DO RECOGNIZE

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:04.561
THAT -- THAT

02:35:04.628 --> 02:35:06.130
REVENUE SOURCE IS A DECLINING

02:35:06.196 --> 02:35:07.798
REVENUE SOURCE AND WE LOOK

02:35:07.865 --> 02:35:08.632
FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE

02:35:08.699 --> 02:35:10.434
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:35:10.501 --> 02:35:12.069
LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATIONS

02:35:12.136 --> 02:35:14.271
TO SEE WHAT THE PROPER SOURCES

02:35:14.338 --> 02:35:15.739
OF FUNDING AREN'T THERE ARE.

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:17.441
AS MENTIONED BEFORE

02:35:17.508 --> 02:35:19.176

02:35:23.247 --> 02:35:24.548
WITHOUT INSURANCE --

02:35:24.615 --> 02:35:25.949
MANY OF THOSE THAT HAVE

02:35:26.016 --> 02:35:28.252
INSURANCE STILL CANNOT AFFORD

02:35:28.318 --> 02:35:30.454
THE INSURANCE THAT THEY HAVE DUE

02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:31.488
TO FOOD COST RENT BECAUSE

TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND ANY

02:35:33.357 --> 02:35:34.992
OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES.

02:35:35.059 --> 02:35:36.293
AND WE KNOW THAT THE REMAINING

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:39.196
UNINSURED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TO

02:35:39.263 --> 02:35:40.097
SIX HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF THEM

02:35:40.164 --> 02:35:42.199
ARE UNINSURED EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:35:42.266 --> 02:35:43.233
ARE ELIGIBLE.

02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:45.903
FOR A FEDERAL SUBSIDIES TO HELP

EMPHASIZE LOOKING AT OPTIONS

02:35:57.081 --> 02:35:59.183
THAT WOULD DO ODD BOTH OF THOSE

02:35:59.249 --> 02:36:01.151
THINGS AND THEN LASTLY OUR GOAL

02:36:01.218 --> 02:36:03.287
CONTINUES TO BE TO SOME WITHOUT

02:36:03.353 --> 02:36:04.988

02:36:05.055 --> 02:36:07.391
WHAT INDIVIDUALS PAY 2% OF THEIR

HOW WE CAN SOLVE THIS

02:36:28.779 --> 02:36:32.182

FOR CALIFORNIA --

02:36:45.162 --> 02:36:45.496
THANK YOU SENATORS

02:36:45.562 --> 02:36:47.731

FOR GIVE ME THE EXTRA A FEW

02:36:48.532 --> 02:36:49.767
MINUTES -- I

02:36:49.833 --> 02:36:50.901
AM WANTING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY

02:36:50.968 --> 02:36:52.302
JUST REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT --

02:36:52.369 --> 02:36:55.472
WHO WE ARE A --

02:36:55.539 --> 02:36:56.006
HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

02:36:56.073 --> 02:36:56.907
CALIFORNIANS SUPPORTERS.

02:36:56.974 --> 02:36:58.342
OF WE ALSO --

02:36:58.408 --> 02:36:59.977
IF THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT

02:37:00.043 --> 02:37:01.845
ABOUT HOW MUCH CALIFORNIA IS

02:37:01.912 --> 02:37:03.413
ANGRY ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN'T

02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:05.415
AFFORD -- WE

02:37:05.482 --> 02:37:08.986
JUST HAD A POLL RELEASED UNIONS.

02:37:09.052 --> 02:37:10.821
ARE WILLING TO PAY INCREASED

02:37:10.888 --> 02:37:12.122
TAXES FOR SINGLE PAYER.

02:37:12.189 --> 02:37:14.258
ON THE SECOND POLE IS 51%

02:37:14.324 --> 02:37:16.226
CALIFORNIANS WANT TO DUMP

02:37:16.293 --> 02:37:18.295
PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR SINGLE

02:37:18.362 --> 02:37:19.196
PAYER --

02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:19.696
THIS JUST GIVES YOU AN

02:37:19.763 --> 02:37:22.166
INDICATION HOW ANGRY PEOPLE ARE

02:37:22.232 --> 02:37:23.834
I'M GOING BACK TO THE FORD

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:24.802
ABILITY HERE --

02:37:24.868 --> 02:37:27.204
I'M GLAD THAT UNDER INSURED WAS

02:37:27.271 --> 02:37:28.539
TALKED ABOUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO

02:37:28.605 --> 02:37:31.275
BE TALKED ABOUT JUST AS FAR AS

02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:32.810
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INSURED --

02:37:32.876 --> 02:37:34.111
I BELIEVE THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE

02:37:34.178 --> 02:37:36.380
UP RECENTLY --

02:37:36.446 --> 02:37:39.316
ABOUT ALMOST HALF THE POPULATION

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:40.017
IF THEY GET A FIVE HUNDRED

02:37:40.083 --> 02:37:41.151
DOLLAR BILL --

02:37:41.218 --> 02:37:42.186
THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT OR AT LEAST

02:37:42.252 --> 02:37:43.954
THEY ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIGURE

02:37:44.021 --> 02:37:47.057
OUT A WAY TO AFFORD SUCH A BILL --

02:37:47.124 --> 02:37:49.126
IT'S IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM THE

02:37:49.193 --> 02:37:50.661
NUMBERS THAT THEY HAD IN ARE

02:37:50.727 --> 02:37:51.895
ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT CORRECT --

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:53.964
I BELIEVE FROM THE TWENTY

02:37:54.031 --> 02:37:55.532
SIXTEEN STUDY I LAST SAW.

02:37:55.599 --> 02:38:00.070
IT AS FAR AS AFFORDABILITY WITH --

02:38:00.137 --> 02:38:03.907
PREMIUMS AND WE HAVE --

02:38:03.974 --> 02:38:08.011
TO I THINK LAW GETS LOST.

02:38:08.078 --> 02:38:10.280
AS FAR AS WHAT PEOPLE --

02:38:10.347 --> 02:38:10.747
PAY -- I

02:38:10.814 --> 02:38:13.784
BELIEVE THAT I EMPLOYER INSURERS --

02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:16.053
TO PEOPLE ARE PAYING ABOUT

02:38:16.119 --> 02:38:16.687
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR

02:38:16.753 --> 02:38:18.488
ON AVERAGE ON THE ON THE HIGH

02:38:18.555 --> 02:38:21.325
END -- IT IS --

02:38:21.391 --> 02:38:23.093
AND THAT IS GROWING AND WE ARE

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:25.028
TALKING ABOUT --

02:38:25.095 --> 02:38:28.065
THINGS ABOUT YEAH 8% 5%

02:38:28.131 --> 02:38:30.400
INCREASES IN PREMIUMS --

02:38:30.467 --> 02:38:32.502
THAT'S NOT GETTING BETTER --

02:38:32.569 --> 02:38:36.573
IF YEAR EVEN IF --

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:38.275
EVEN IF INFLATION IS 3% PEOPLE

02:38:38.342 --> 02:38:40.077
SALARIES DON'T EVEN GO UP 3% A

02:38:40.143 --> 02:38:42.112
YEAR SO THEY CAN'T EVEN AFFORD

02:38:42.179 --> 02:38:43.914
THAT IT'S IT'S EVEN WORSE --

02:38:43.981 --> 02:38:46.383
I I JUST ONE TOUCH ON PEOPLE

02:38:46.450 --> 02:38:48.318
TALK ABOUT PRIVATE INSURANCE AND

02:38:48.385 --> 02:38:49.953
HAVING BETTER CHOICES THE

02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:52.656
NETWORKS ARE SMALL AND IN FACT

02:38:52.723 --> 02:38:54.224
WHAT WE JUST SAW WAS SUTTER --

02:38:54.291 --> 02:38:54.758
THEY'RE CUTTING OFF THEIR

02:38:54.825 --> 02:38:56.660
NETWORKS --

02:38:56.727 --> 02:38:58.362
TO I BELIEVE IT'S BLUESHIELD IN

02:38:58.428 --> 02:39:00.063
MY CORRECT TONIGHT ANYWAY --

02:39:00.130 --> 02:39:00.831
SO THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF

02:39:00.898 --> 02:39:02.532
CUSTOMERS WE CAN'T EVEN GET TO

02:39:02.599 --> 02:39:04.234
THEIR DOCTORS THROUGH THAT --

02:39:04.301 --> 02:39:06.336
SF GENERAL SECRETARY GUESTS HAVE

02:39:06.403 --> 02:39:07.437
GENERALLY MIGHT OF HEARD ABOUT

02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:07.971
THAT --

02:39:08.038 --> 02:39:12.809
BILLION PATIENTS BALANCE BILLING

02:39:12.876 --> 02:39:14.645
AND HE'S --

02:39:14.711 --> 02:39:15.279
ON THE HOOK FOR NINETY THOUSAND

02:39:15.345 --> 02:39:16.446
DOLLARS.

02:39:16.513 --> 02:39:18.415
I'M SO HE'S INSURED AND THAT'S

02:39:18.482 --> 02:39:19.416
WITH INSURANCE.

02:39:19.483 --> 02:39:21.885
SO IT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE

02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:23.086
INSURANCE DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN

02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:25.022
ACTUALLY AFFORD --

02:39:25.088 --> 02:39:26.490
HOSPITAL ANYMORE --

02:39:26.556 --> 02:39:28.225
NOW WITH THE MANDATE IF YOU'RE

02:39:28.292 --> 02:39:30.294
GOING TO MANDATE SUCH A THING

02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:34.898
AND I BELIEVE THE THE IS IS IT

02:39:34.965 --> 02:39:36.900
THE BENEFIT WAS LIKE TWENTY FOUR

02:39:36.967 --> 02:39:38.302
DOLLARS --

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:40.037
IS THAT IF WE REINSTATE A

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:41.538
MANDATE WELL THAT'S RIDICULOUS

02:39:41.605 --> 02:39:43.840
WITH GIVE YOU JUST SAW THE THE

02:39:43.907 --> 02:39:44.841
GRAPHICS WITH WHERE THEY ARE YOU

02:39:44.908 --> 02:39:46.376
KNOW ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED

02:39:46.443 --> 02:39:48.578
DOLLARS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED

02:39:48.645 --> 02:39:48.812
DOLLARS.

02:39:48.879 --> 02:39:50.347
WAS TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS.

02:39:50.414 --> 02:39:51.982
ON THAT AND ASSIST THE PREMIUM

02:39:52.049 --> 02:39:53.216
THAT'S THAT DOESN'T COUNT THAT

02:39:53.283 --> 02:39:54.184
DOESN'T INCLUDE THEIR

02:39:54.251 --> 02:39:56.420
DEDUCTIBLES ARE OR THEIR CO PAYS

02:39:56.486 --> 02:39:58.288
TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS IS NOTHING.

02:39:58.355 --> 02:40:00.223
IF YOU TRY --

02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:01.124
TO IF YOU TRY TO REINSTATE THE

02:40:01.191 --> 02:40:01.591
MANDATE --

02:40:01.658 --> 02:40:03.427
WILL OPPOSE IT 1100% AT THIS

02:40:03.493 --> 02:40:05.228
POINT WE NEED TO HEAR MORE ABOUT

02:40:05.295 --> 02:40:06.863
HOW YOU GUYS YOU CAN MAKE IT

02:40:06.930 --> 02:40:08.465
AFFORDABLE.

02:40:08.532 --> 02:40:09.833
ON FOR THE REST OF THE PEOPLE

02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:10.233

02:40:17.607 --> 02:40:19.409
INSURANCE --

02:40:19.476 --> 02:40:20.811
WE BELIEVE THAT'S A SUBSIDY THAT

02:40:20.877 --> 02:40:24.014
ON THAT WE WILL FIGHT AS WELL IT

02:40:24.081 --> 02:40:26.116
SHOULD ONLY GO TO PUBLIC --

02:40:26.183 --> 02:40:27.951
INSURANCE ON IT OTHERWISE

02:40:28.018 --> 02:40:30.520
THEY'RE SOCIALIZING THEIR LOSSES

02:40:30.587 --> 02:40:31.822
AND THE PROFITS OF WE SEEM

02:40:31.888 --> 02:40:32.656

A THREE BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT --

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:38.628

02:41:31.715 --> 02:41:32.249
COUPLE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE

02:41:32.315 --> 02:41:34.217
LEARNED IN THEIR FIRST OF ALL

02:41:34.284 --> 02:41:35.519
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIFFS

02:41:35.585 --> 02:41:36.787
IN HERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:41:36.853 --> 02:41:37.054
WESTERN.

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:38.321
CENTER ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT IS

02:41:38.388 --> 02:41:39.890
THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL CLIFF AND

02:41:39.956 --> 02:41:40.991
THAT'S THE ONE WHEN YOU MOVE

02:41:41.058 --> 02:41:41.491
FROM MEDICAID TO COVER

02:41:41.558 --> 02:41:43.060

COVERAGE TO COVERAGE THAT HAS

02:41:46.596 --> 02:41:48.732
PREMIUM COSTS EVEN THOUGH

02:41:48.799 --> 02:41:49.699
THEY'RE LOW AND HAS COME.

02:41:49.766 --> 02:41:51.234
OUT OF POCKET COSTS EVEN THOUGH

02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:52.436
THEY'RE LOW IT'S STILL VERY

02:41:52.502 --> 02:41:53.570
DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES

02:41:53.637 --> 02:41:55.205
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

02:41:55.272 --> 02:41:56.673
IN DEEP POVERTY FOR YEARS.

02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:57.874
AND THEN END UP FINALLY GETTING

02:41:57.941 --> 02:41:59.509
A PAYCHECK THAT PUTS THEM OVER

02:41:59.576 --> 02:42:01.244
THE MEDI CAL LIMIT --

02:42:01.311 --> 02:42:02.345
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN

02:42:02.412 --> 02:42:04.081

ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT --

02:42:11.154 --> 02:42:13.056
SO WE WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE ANY

02:42:13.123 --> 02:42:14.991
PROPOSAL TO ALSO INCLUDE PEOPLE

POVERTY LEVEL --

02:42:18.695 --> 02:42:19.296
WHEN WE WORKED ON THE

02:42:19.362 --> 02:42:20.664
AFFORDABILITY WORK GROUP WE WERE

02:42:20.730 --> 02:42:21.932
ABLE TO SEE SOME OF THE MODELING

02:42:21.998 --> 02:42:23.900
THAT WENT INTO THIS AND SOME OF

02:42:23.967 --> 02:42:25.402
THE GOOD NEWS AS WAS REFERRED TO

02:42:25.469 --> 02:42:27.337
HERE IS THAT --

02:42:27.404 --> 02:42:28.605
IT IS CHEAPER TO HELP THESE

02:42:28.672 --> 02:42:30.006
PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE SUBSIDIES

02:42:30.073 --> 02:42:31.274
THAT ARE AVAILABLE --

02:42:31.341 --> 02:42:33.076
AND ALSO THE TAKE UP RATE IS A

02:42:33.143 --> 02:42:35.946
LOT HIGHER WE'RE GETTING OVER A

02:42:36.012 --> 02:42:36.546
HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:42:36.613 --> 02:42:37.481
ENTERING THE MARKET BASED ON

02:42:37.547 --> 02:42:38.482
SOME OF THE MODELING AT THESE

02:42:38.548 --> 02:42:39.983
LOWER INCOME LEVELS COMPARED TO

02:42:40.050 --> 02:42:41.017

02:42:42.185 --> 02:42:43.120

INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WE ARE

02:42:45.021 --> 02:42:45.856

THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN

UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:48:10.113 --> 02:48:13.583
ALONG WITH ADDRESSING COSCO

02:48:13.650 --> 02:48:14.951
SEEMS THAT CAME UP IN TODAY'S

02:48:15.018 --> 02:48:16.486
HEARING --

02:48:16.553 --> 02:48:18.421
DOCTOR CAN SAID EARLIER THAT WE

02:48:18.488 --> 02:48:20.857

02:48:20.924 --> 02:48:22.826
THAT WE CAN'T KEEP AS A STATE

02:48:22.892 --> 02:48:25.995
AND WE AGREE WE THINK THAT ONE

02:48:26.062 --> 02:48:27.430
OF THE PROMISES THAT'S NOT BEING

02:48:27.497 --> 02:48:29.098

BUT THEN THEY FIND AT THE END OF

02:48:35.271 --> 02:48:37.073
THE DAY THAT COVERAGE DOESN'T

02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:38.241
TAKE THEM ALL THE WAY THERE THEY

02:48:38.308 --> 02:48:40.243
CAN'T AFFORD TO ACTUALLY USE

02:48:40.310 --> 02:48:42.078
THAT THAT COVERAGE --

02:48:42.145 --> 02:48:44.214
WHEN THEY MOST NEED IT A STUDY

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:45.815
THAT CAME OUT --

02:48:45.882 --> 02:48:48.518
VERY RECENTLY WHICH TRYING TO

02:48:48.585 --> 02:48:49.118

02:48:59.729 --> 02:49:01.364
MIDDLE CLASS LARGELY BECAUSE

02:49:01.431 --> 02:49:03.132
LOWER INCOME FOLKS QUALIFY FOR

02:49:03.199 --> 02:49:04.234

PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING --

02:49:06.102 --> 02:49:07.937
TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY AND SO WE

02:49:08.004 --> 02:49:09.239
KNOW THAT COSTS ARE STILL A

02:49:09.305 --> 02:49:10.707
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN THIS IS

02:49:10.773 --> 02:49:12.308
EVEN IN STATES THAT EXPANDED

02:49:12.375 --> 02:49:14.744

CONTINUE TO POUR MONEY INTO
