ON CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY. AND I WANT -- TO WELCOME EVERYONE. WHO'S HERE TODAY -- TODAY IS A BUSY SESSION DAY SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE HEARINGS GOING ABOUT. AND THAT YOU'LL SPICY MEMBERS COMING IN AND OUT OF HERE BUT REST ASSURED -- THAT -- THAT COMMITTEE MEMBER STAFF FULL -- FOR FOLLOWS VERY WILL BE FOLLOWING THIS HEARING -- AND INFORMING THEIR MEMBERS SO I WILL POINT OUT TO JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE VERY BEGINNING OF CENTER HOLLY MITCHELL'S SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING ON SOCIAL TERMS OF CHILDREN'S WELL BEING ALSO A OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT HER OWN SELECT COMMITTEE IS. VERY MUCH ATTUNED TO THE TOUGH TOPICS WILL BE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS I AM TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN HER SELECT COMMITTEE EVEN THOUGH I WILL NOT BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT AT HER SORT COMMITTEE -- BUT BUT YOU CAN SEE IS ACTUALLY. CONSIDER WILL INTEREST IN. SHE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH -- THINKING ABOUT THAT'S LIKE COMPETE THE DRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BUT HERE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I KNOW THAT -- THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN HEALTH. RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN OUR STATE. IN THIS LAST ELECTION WHEN ARE YOU HEALTH IS ONE OF THE TOP CARE COVERAGE. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT FORGET THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. TO SUPPORT -- THE VERY THESE ARE TO KEEP US SAFE AND HEALTHY AND THAT ACTUALLY PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM ACTUALLY HAVING TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS OFTEN. THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOMETHING THAT WORKS HAND IN HAND IN FACT ACTUALLY IS ONE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF KEEPING OUR COMMITTEES HEALTHY. AND IN FACT -- WE THINK ABOUT A YOU WAS A FORMER -- COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN THE US PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE. THAT WAS ONE THE EARLIEST THINGS OUR COUNTRY DID WAS ESTABLISH A PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTHY WE NEED TO HAVE. A A A GOVERNMENT ROLE IN TRY TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASE. TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE OF ACCESS -- TO TO THE CLEAN AIR AND WATER AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE NEED. TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THERE AND SO THAT'S BEEN A CONTINUING ROLE AND GOVERNMENT HERE IN UNITED STATES PRACTICALLY SINCE OUR FOUNDING OUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT -- GEORGE WASHINGTON WHEN HE WAS COMMANDED REVOLUTIONARY ARMY ACTUALLY MANDATED INOCULATION WITH SMALLPOX TO ENSURE THAT HIS ARMY DIDN'T DIE OF DISEASE BEFORE THE BRITISH -- THE MET THE BRITISH ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND SO CLEARLY PUBLIC HEALTH IS PLAYED EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ROLE -- FROM THE BEGINNING OF OUR COUNTRY THROUGH -- MORE TALK ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE FLU PANDEMIC THAT AFTER WILDER ONE WHICH BY THE WAY KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN ALL THE SOLDIERS SAILORS AND AIRMEN THAT SERVED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR -- TO THE INNOVATIONS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED. IN THE PAST CENTURY AFTER -- WORLD WAR TWO TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY. SO -- WITH THAT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA OF WATER ALL THE COMPONENTS OF THAT WE OFTEN TAKE TOO MUCH FOR GRANTED OVER PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE SURE THAT A STRONG AND THAT AIN'T THIS A VERY VITAL PART OF OUR OUR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND A GOVERNMENT. SO I'M VERY PLEASED THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE HAVE -- HERE TODAY WE HAVE SEVERAL PANELS ONE WILL START OFF AT THE STATE LEVEL OVERVIEW THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. ROLE OF THE LOCAL HEALTH. DEPARTMENTS AND THEN -- ALSO FOCUS ON SOME PARTICULAR DISEASES ARE CONDITIONS THAT -- WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO THE ADDRESS THROUGH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ALSO DO WANTING KNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THE AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AS WELL BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANT ROLE. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AND HOW THEY ALL WORK IN CONCERT -- CERTAINLY IS CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY JUST HAD A HEARING ON THE CALIFORNIA FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND RECORD BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET OF THE CALIFORNIA BAR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTUALLY COMES IN FEDERAL GRANTS. IN FEDERAL FUNDS SO THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP THAT HAS TO WORK ACROSS ALL THESE LAYERS AND ALSO I POINT OUT THAT MANY DISEASES THEY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICAL BOUNDARIES DAY -- SO -- SO THAT'S WHY WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AND EVEN WITH THE WORLD -- AS WELL THE REST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. SO WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD BEGIN AND I'M A UNIFIED UPPER STATE LEVEL OVERVIEW OF VERY PLEASED TO HAVE OUR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA BAR PUBLIC HEALTH DOCTOR TERENCE SMITH. WE ALSO HAVE DOCTOR DEAL SHOP THIS IS DIFFIE DIRECTOR OF AT THE CENTER AND OF THE CENTER F TEXAS DISEASE AT THE PART F PUBLIC HEALTH. AND SUSAN -- FINELLI. IS ALSO CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF POLICY PROGRAMS THAT APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THEY'RE GONNA GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF BASICALLY THE DEPARTMENT VEHICLE DISEASES AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS -- AND INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO AN OVERVIEW OF THE CENTER FOR FAXES THESE ROLL. ROLE PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON SOME OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASE LIKE STDS AND T. B. AND THEN OF COURSE -- OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS IN EPIDEMICS AS WELL AT THE TO SERVING UP LIKE THE CAMPFIRE SO WELCOME AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU -- MISTER TURNER AND I AM A DOCTOR KAREN SMITH I'M THE CD PH DIRECTOR AND THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. AND I'VE ASKED TO BE ADDED TO PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT AND TO SHARE WITH YOU -- A CONCERN THAT I HAVE REGARDING PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. TO CITY PAGES FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES ARE EXTREMELY BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE ARE KEY ACTIVITIES IN SERVICE SERVICES INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM THE THREAT OF PREVENTABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. TO PROVIDING A GOOD RELIABLE LOCK AND PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICES AND INFORMATION ON HEALTH THREATS WE ALSO PROVIDE NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT TO LOW INCOME WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN -- WE SCREEN NEWBORNS IN PREGNANT WOMEN FOR GENETIC DISEASES AND WE ALSO WORK TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF FOOD AND BOTTLED WATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HELP REDUCE RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC DISEASES LIKE SMOKING AND DIABETES AND A AND OBESITY AND THEN TO PREVENT THE DISEASE'S THEMSELVES. WE ALSO PROTECT PATIENT SAFETY AND HOSPITALS AS YOU KNOW AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES MAINTAIN VITAL RECORDS FOR THE STATE AND RESPOND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AMONG OTHER MISCELLANEOUS ACTIVITIES -- SIOUX CITY PITCH IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY COMPONENT. OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH STRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH STRUCTURE PARTICULARLY ENCOMPASSES BOTH. THE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY DEPARTMENT TOGETHER. CITY PH RELIES ON LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO ACTUALLY CARRY OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE MAJORITY OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR AT THAT LEVEL -- EACH COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE AND THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE THE ONES HAVE THE BEST UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WHAT THEY'RE CHALLENGES ARE AND HOW TO ADDRESS THEM. WANT TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THE WORK OF GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH. AS I SAID WE HAVE WE DO MANY THINGS IN IN PUBLIC HEALTH BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN CORE FUNCTIONS -- OF GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH IN PARTICULAR THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS VERY LARGE INCLUDES OTHER PARTNERS BUT FOR GOVERNMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AS YOU POINTED OUT MISTER CHAIR. THIS WAS IN THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL. RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT HEALTH. WE HAVE A WE HAVE A LANGUAGE THAT WE USE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES THIS IS A SET OF SERVICES THAT WAS FIRST ENVISIONED BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE AND IN A REPORT A FEW YEARS AGO CALLED -- INVESTING IN A HEALTHIER FUTURE. THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE MINIMUM PACKAGE OF SERVICES THAT MUST BE AVAILABLE AT STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS EVERYWHERE FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEM TO WORK ANYWHERE. ANDTHEY INCLUDE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH MATERNAL CHILD AND FAMILY HEALTH AND WORKING WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO ASSESS AND CREATE HAVE LINKAGES TO CLINICAL CARE. BUT IMPORTANTLY EACH OF THESE. IS A FOUNDATIONAL SERVICES REQUIRE CERTAIN CAPABILITIES AND THOSE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE GATHERING ANALYZING PRIORITIZING REPORTING OUT ON DATA AROUND HEALTH RISKS. THIS IS STAINED ABILITY AND CAPACITY TROLL DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES. TO SERVE AS A PRIMARY AND EXPERT RESOURCE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC TO PROVIDE RISK COMMUNICATIONS. AND THE ABILITY TO CONVENE COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS IN AN AUTHENTIC FASHION TO TOGETHER WORK TOWARD HER PROTECTING HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS THE BASIC ADMINISTRATIVE CAPABILITIES. EACH OF THESE CAPABILITIES IS ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEY HAVE THEY NEED THOSE TO CARRY OUT THOSE FOUNDATIONAL SERVICES. AS WELL AS TO ADAPT TO THE EVER CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH FINDS ITSELF IN. AND THESE CAPABILITIES. RESIDE IN THE STAFF WHO WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH IN THEIR EXPERTISE AND THEIR EXPERIENCE. BUT IT'S THIS VERY INFRASTRUCTURE OF TRAINED SKILLED PEOPLE. THAT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY ERODED OVER THE PAST DECADE YES WE ALSO NEED OUR DATA SYSTEMS THE OTHER HARD CORE BUT THE REALLY AT THE HEART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT WORK AND I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY MY IN WHEN I WAS A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER. DURING THE RECESSION IN THREE YEARS WE HAD FOURTEEN ROUNDS OF BUDGET CUTS AND IT DIDN'T TAKE MANY ROUNDS TO GET DOWN TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE. AND THOSE THAT FUNDING AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE NEVER CAME BACK. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF OUR EXPERIENCE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A VERY REAL THREAT TO THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA. AND THERE'S NO READY SUPPLY OF TRAINED PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ARE EPIDEMIOLOGISTS OR COMMUNICATE DISEASE INVESTIGATORS SITTING AROUND WAITING FOR US TO CALL ON THEM IN THE CASE OF A CRISIS. AND IN FACT WE ARE IN A CRISIS OUR SURPLUS RATES AS YOU KNOW. OUR THE AT THE HIGHEST THEY'VE BEEN IN TWENTY THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ONLY INVESTIGATE A TINY FRACTION OF THOSE CASES AND CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS. ARE HIGHLY LIMITED BUT WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO STOP THE RISING CASES. TO TO MAINTAIN THE CAPABILITY IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THIS THE SERVICES THAT EVERY COMMUNITY NEEDS AND DESERVES. REQUIRES A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE THAT CAN BE INVESTED OVER TIME. IN AN EXPERIENCED WORK FORCE THAT CAN NOT ONLY RESPOND TO WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY BUT CAN ALSO WORK INTO THE FUTURE THANK YOU. ASK QUESTIONS AT THE END OKAY GO UP GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DR GIL CHAVEZ I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES. I AM I AM THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME THOUGHTS ON THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO ADDRESS INFECTIOUS DISEASE THREATS. LET ME START BY SAYING THAT INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE A MAJOR COST OF AN OF ILLNESS AND DEATH IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MICROORGANISMS IN OUR ECOSYSTEM WITH A KEEN ABILITY TO EVOLVE AND ADAPT. IN CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE AND TRAVEL. CREATE ONGOING AND NEVER ENDING THREATS TO OUR HEALTH AND CONTINUOUSLY TEST AND CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO PREVENT AND CONTROL DISEASE. THE NUMBER OF CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES REPORTED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. HOUSE INCREASED NEARLY 45% OVER THE LAST DECADE. EVERY YEAR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS REPORT NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES OF NOTIFIABLE INFECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS EQUATES TO ABOUT ONE CASE PER ONE HUNDRED PERSONS RESIDING IN CALIFORNIA. NOTIFY WILL INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. MANY INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT ARE NOT REPORTABLE ARE ALSO AFFECTING CALIFORNIANS AND REQUIRE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. OUR SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF REVIEWING AND RESPONDING TO ALL OF THESE THIS IS THREATS. MANY OF THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IN PUBLIC HEALTH ARE RARE. BUT HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. OTHERS HOWEVER. ARE MORE COMMON IN ACCOUNT FOR SIGNIFICANT ONGOING BURDEN OF THE SEAS. THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF INFECTIONS REPORTER IN CALIFORNIA ARE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES WHICH INCLUDE SYPHILIS GONORRHEA AND CHLAMYDIA. FOLLOWED BY BY -- HEPATITIS. RESTAURANT TESTING ALL INFECTIONS AND VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASES. VECTOR BORNE DISEASES SUCH AS WEST NILE VIRUS INFECTION. FUNGAL INFECTIONS SUCH AS THE VALLEY FEVER. AND INFECTIONS TRANSMITTED BY BODY FLUIDS SUCH AS HIV AIDS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT CAUSES OF MORBIDITY IN THE STATE SEASONAL INFLUENZA. CAN COSTS YEARLY WAVES OF INFECTIONS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR UP 27% OF ALL HOSPITALIZATIONS. DURING THE PEAK OF THE SEASON IN HOSPITAL VOLUNTARY REPORTING TO SEE THE PH. NOROVIRUS CAUSES AN ESTIMATED ILLNESSES IN THE STATE. ALL OF THESE THESE PIECES BECAUSE A GREAT DEAL OF SUFFERING AND DEATH. AND IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDENS TO THE STATE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS. NOW LET ME BRIEFLY DESCRIBE SOME OF THE WORK WE DO IN PUBLIC HEALTH. AT THE CORE OF OUR DAILY ACTIVITIES HE'S OUR BELIEF THAT WE EXIST TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. FROM THE THREAT OF REVENTABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THE DELIVERY OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL. HE'S ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A SOLID PARTNERSHIP OF FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WITH SUPPORT FROM CV PH. HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL INCLUDING RESPONDING TO POT BREAKS IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. ONE OF OUR JOINT KEY ACTIVITIES ENOUGH FOUNDATION TO ALL WE DO IS TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA FROM LABORATORIES. AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ON EIGHTY SIX INFECTIOUS DISEASE AS A PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE. THESE SURVEILLANCE FUNCTION IS ESSENTIAL. BY GIVING US INTELLIGENCE FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE THREATS. WE ROUTINELY PREPARE AND RESPOND TO SUSPECT CASES OF BIO TERRORISM AND OTHER EMERGES EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES A PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANT AN EMERGENCE AS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE INVESTIGATED AND BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS SUCCESSION OF HUNDREDS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALONE. CV PH RESPONDED TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY OUTBREAKS. MANY HUNDREDS MORE WERE INVESTIGATED AND ADDRESS LOCALLY WITHOUT SEE THE PH SUPPORT. THESE OUTBREAKS VARY IN SIZE FROM A HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUALS TO HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. IN VARIOUS SEVERITY FROM MILD TO VERY SEVERE. IN EVERY INSTANCE SWIFT PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION PROVED TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR CONTAINMENT [inaudible] OFTEN. PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES MUST PULL STUFF FROM ONGOING COMMUNICABLE DISEASE ACTIVITIES. SUCH AS TASTY THE CONTROL AND PROMOTION OF THE MANY SESSIONS TO ADDRESS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. THUS THE ADDED WORKLOAD OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT STRESS. ON ALL COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL EFFORTS. MAINTAINING AN EXPANDED THE CAPABILITIES TO PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES IS BOTH ESSENTIAL IN CHALLENGING. AS A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SEE THE PH FACE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AN OUTBREAK SO THE COMMUNITY LEVEL WE FIND OURSELVES CONSTANTLY CHALLENGED TO RESPONDING CARRY OUT OUR IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH WORK. I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY INITIATE A RESPONSE TO ANY SINGLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE THREAT. HOWEVER HANDLING MULTIPLE THREATS AT THE SAME TIME OR SUSTAINING A VERY LENGTHY AND PROTRACTED RESPONSE WITHOUT AFFECTING. OUR DAILY WORK WE CONTINUE TO PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SUSAN VALLEY I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY OF POLICY AND PROGRAMS IN OUR DEPARTMENT. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM -- PREPAREDNESS AND EMERGENCY THAT BREAKS SEE PAGE HAS RESPONDED TO AN INCREASING NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF OUTBREAKS -- OF DISASTERS SUCH AS WILDFIRES FLOODS EXTREME HEAT EVENTS EARTHQUAKES -- DROUGHT POWER OUTAGES YOU NAME IT -- AND MANY INFECTIOUS DISEASES FROM EBOLA EBOLA TO SEEK OUT THE H. ONE AND ONE AND HEPATITIS A UNDER THE STATE EMERGENCY PLAN THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EMSA SERVES AS A CO LEAD FOR EMERGENCY FUNCTION EIGHT PUBLIC HEALTH A MEDICAL. IN THIS ROLE WE WORK WITH THAT -- GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO COORDINATE PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE DURING AN EMERGENCY. I WE WORK WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHIN OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND WE CERTAINLY WORK WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED UNDER OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESPONSE STRUCTURE AND MATT AND ON IS ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE EMERGENCY PLAN. THE PURPOSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESPONSE SYSTEM IS TO BUILD A COP COMMON OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT EFFECTIVE INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE PARTNERS AND TO SUPPORT EFFICIENT RESPONSE WHEN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. THAT EXCEED THE LOCAL RESPONSE CAPABILITIES INCLUDING COORDINATION OF MUTUAL AID ACROSS JURISDICTIONS. THE PILLARS OF THIS RESPONSE SYSTEM ARE THE LOCAL MEDICAL AND HEALTH OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR. LOVINGLY CALLED THE MOHAWK PROGRAM WHICH HAS SEVENTEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL FUNCTIONS UNDER STATUTE. THE REGIONAL DISASTER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SPECIALIST CO SUPPORT IT BY -- IN EACH MUTUAL AID READ MS AGENCY AND THE STATE. AND THE STATE MEDICAL HELP COORDINATION CENTER AND OUR CENTERS AND PROGRAMS THIS STRUCTURE EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE IMPACT IT LOCAL JURISDICTION OR JURISDICTIONS. IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE THE STATE LOCAL ROLE I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE YOU JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW WE WORK TOGETHER IN EACH ONE AND ONE THE PANDEMIC INFLUENZA AND IN THE RECENT CAMPFIRE. AB SO IN EACH ONE AND ONE ONCE A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA IS VIRUSES IDENTIFIED SEE THE PAGE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COORDINATE ON HAND AND ENHANCED. LABORATORY SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES ON LABORATORYTESTING -- CD PAGE WORKS WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION PLAN BASED ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THAT THE DISEASE WITH IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE WORK TOGETHER TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE AND SUBSEQUENTLY REDISTRIBUTE BACK SCENE BASED ON ABILITY. AVAILABILITY AND NEED -- SEE PAGE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WORK TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR VACCINATION. SEE THE PAGE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WORK TOGETHER TO ASSESS AND RECOMMEND THE NEED AND TIMING FOR NON FORMER SUITABLE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS SCHOOL CLOSURES CANCELING MASS GATHERINGS AND SO MANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE DID DURING H. ONE ON ONE IN THE RECENT CAMPFIRE. WE WORK TOGETHER AND WE ACTIVATED OUR MEDICAL HEALTH AND COORDINATION CENTER TO COORDINATE PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESPONSE ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND WITH OUR LOCAL -- PARTNERS CREATING A COMMON OPERATING PICTURE WITH A DAILY SITUATION REPORT THAT INCLUDES ALL THE ACTIVITIES BOTH STATE AND LOCAL AND SHARE THAT OUT. WE MONITOR AND TRACK THE IMPACT TO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND THAT INCLUDES OUR OWN FACILITIES THAT WE LICENSE AS WELL AS AGGREGATING AND MAPPING ALL OF THE FILM FACILITIES THAT HAVE OVERSIGHT UNDER OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WE ASSIST THEM HEALTHCARE FACILITIES CAN YOU. TO HELP THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR OPERATIONS AND TO EVACUATE PATIENTS AND THAT IS A JOINT RESPONSIBILITY AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. I'M AND WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. WE ALSO -- PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND OFTEN INVOLVE THEM IN AND DEVELOPING THE GUIDANCE SUCH AS AIR QUALITY THE USE OF AN NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS DEBRIS REMOVAL AND HEALTH OFFICER EMERGENCY POWERS -- WE ALSO PROVIDE -- EPIDEMIOLOGIC SUPPORT EXPERTISE TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAFF TO ASSIST IN TRACKING THINGS LIKE THE NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK IN -- BE COUNTY SHELTERS AND IN SOME CASES WHERE THERE'S LIMITED STAFF AND THE STAFF ARE IMPACTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BY THE M. EMERGENCY WE IN THE CASE OF BUTTE COUNTY ALSO RE DIRECT AT SOME OF OUR STAFF. FROM OTHER PROGRAMS TO DEPLOY A INFECTION CONTROL TEAMS TO MANY SHELTERS IN BUTTE COUNTY -- IN PRIOR FIRES ARE BILL HAS REALLY BEEN MORE OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON INFECTION CONTROL BUT WE NOW RECOGNIZE THAT PRETTY CANYON SMALL COUNTIES HERE MAY BE A NEED. FOR THE EARLIER WE GOT AND INTO THE SHELTERS THE BETTER WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL INFECTION. I WE ALSO PROVIDE FACTSHEETS ON NOR OF SHELTER INTAKE KINDS OF THINGS SO AS I'VE TRIED TO DEMONSTRATE CRITICAL TO EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY RESPONSE IS THE EXPERTISE AND ACTIONS OF BOTH LOCAL AND STATE STAFF. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE BUILT WORKING TOGETHER WITHIN THE OVERALL PUBLICHEALTH AND MEDICAL RESPONSE STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE IMPACTED JURISDICTIONS SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TESTIFY TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- QUESTIONS. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO -- BLACKSMITH BLACKSMITH -- SO -- I MADE REFERENCE IN MY REMARKS ABOUT THE THE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGETS. YOU TALK ABOUT THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- AND IN THE PARTS OF THE SERVICE STAFF CAPACITY SO I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE BUDGET IS ACTUALLY FROM STATE FUNDS OR TO WHAT DEGREE ARE YOU DEPENDENT ON THE STATE FUNDS TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS OF BECAUSE THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND CENTER FROM GRANTS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE IS NOT JUST LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WROTE A BIG CHECK AND SAID HERE USES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH THEY HAVE. THEIR IT IT'S FOR VERY SPECIFIC THINGS. SO. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE ROLE OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND IN TERMS OF% MAINTAINING THAT CORE INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT CORPS STAFF. I MEAN -- ONLY JUST POSING AS A RELATED QUESTION THAT MAYBE CAN A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING PAID FOR FEDERAL FUNDS TO DO VERY SPECIFIC THINGS. WHAT THREE CAN YOU PULL PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING PAID TO DO TASKS FOR THE FEDERAL GET THAT THAT THAT FEDERAL FUNDS ARE PAYING FOR AND PULL THEM OUT OF THE THAT WORK AND SAY NO WE GOT WORK ON THIS STATE HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT WE HAVE? AND YANK THEM OUT OF AND HOW DOES THAT AND AND DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GO WELL GEE. THEY'RE NOT DOING THE WORK THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR THE FOR WHY WE STILL PAYING THEM RIGHT NOW SO A BABY THEY COULD SPEAK ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING STRUCTURE AFFECTS YOUR ABILITY TO BUILD THE KIND OF STAFF CAPACITY. YOU SAY THE STATE NEEDS. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE FEDERAL MONEY IS OVERWHELMINGLY THE MONEY THAT WE USE PARTICULARLY FOR THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE SHARE WITH LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH -- AND IT IS IN FACT QUITE SILOS BY DISEASE TYPE IT CETERA THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FUNDING STREAMS FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT ALLOWS US A LITTLE MORE LATITUDE PARTICULARLY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE ONE OF THOSE IS THE PREVENTION PUBLIC HEALTH FUND. WHICH IS A TYPE OF BLOCK GRANT -- IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WATCH MOST CAREFULLY IN CONGRESS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN UNDER ATTACK SINCE IT WAS FIRST CREATED AND SO THAT'S NOT A VERY RELIABLE SOURCE BUT WE USE THAT ALONG WITH FUNDING THAT WE HAVE THAT ALLOWS US -- TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN OUR DATA SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE AND OUR EPIDEMIOLOGY CAPACITY SO THAT WE CAN TRAIN PEOPLE ACROSS SERVICES. THE ISSUE OF REDIRECTING STAFF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T THIS WAS PART OF A CONVERSATION ACTUALLY WITH LOCAL AND AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS -- AFTER EACH ONE AND ONE AND AROUND THE THE PANDEMIC AND ALL HAZARDS PREPAREDNESS. FUND WAS AROUND. THERE ARE A THE YOU TO RE DIRECT STAFF PAID FOR WITH FEDERAL FUNDS UP 25% OF THEIR TIME. SO AS SOON DOCTOR CHAVEZ POINTED OUT POINTED OUT WE'RE VERY GOOD AT SMALL SHORT TERM THINGS WE BEGIN TO STRUGGLE WHEN IT REQUIRES A LONGER TERM. REDIRECTION OF STAFF AND WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THE OTHER WORKED SIMPLY DOESN'T GET DONE. AND AND OR WHAT EVERYONE WHO IS -- NOT ON AN HOURLY SCHEDULE MANAGERS AT CENTER I WORKED VERY VERY LONG HOURS TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK -- I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE DO BUT IT IS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE AND I WILL SAY THAT THAT VERY SAME STRUGGLE PLACE OUT. AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT MUCH OF THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE RECEIVE. ALMOST ALL OF IT IS ACTUALLY ALSO SIDELOAD LESS THAN 4% OF OUR BUDGET IS ACTUALLY FLEXIBLE ME[inaudible] OKAY. AND WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE THE I GUESS THE BLACK IS IT BASICALLY STAFF EXPERTISE WHY I MEAN BY THAT IS IS THAT IT'S NOT THE EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY THERE BUT JUST BE IT'S IT'S THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE EXPERTISE RIGHT IT'S NOT. I GUESS WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE. WE'RE NOT PAYING EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES TO SIT AROUND WITH THE ALARM THAT GOES OFF WHEN IT RIGHT THERE THEY'RE DOING EXISTING TASKS. WHICH WE COULD ALL RIGHT THIS IS A HAS THERE BEEN ASSESSMENT DONE IS TO SO WHAT IS THE SHORTFALL I MEAN I REALIZE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME JUDGMENT TO BE MADE WHAT WHAT HOW MANY WHAT IS THE WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE GOAL NUMBER BUT IT WHEN YOU SAY WE SO. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO HIRE PEOPLE OR WHEN THERE'S -- EVENTS THAT HAPPENED -- CAN R. V. LIKE A LITTLE SHORTER A LOT SHORTER -- WHAT FOR SALE LIKE WE COULD USE TWICE AS MANY AS WE HAVE NOW OR SOME SOME? ANALYSTS SAY THAT I DON'T THE I THINK THAT FOR SPEAKING FOR CPAS. I DON'T THINK THAT OUR SHORTFALL IS PARTICULARLY DRAMATIC AYE OUR CHALLENGE IS NOT SO MUCH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING AS THE WAY THE FUNDING COMES TO US. TO DO VERY VERY VERY CREATIVE IN ORDER TO SEARCH PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR THAT -- I WORRY ABOUT THE PANDEMIC THAT TAKES TWO YEARS -- WE WILL WE WILL BURN OUT WE HAVE NOT DONE A FORMAL ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FULLY FLESHED OUT WHERE IT BECOMES CRITICAL REALLY IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU HAVE. ONE OR TWO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES IT TOOK US TWO YEARS TO HIGHER WHEN I WAS IN AFFECT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TOOK US TWO YEARS TO HIRE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW OF THEM OUT THERE -- AND BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE MUCH MORE MONEY OBVIOUSLY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SO KEEPING THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE INVESTED IN THAT YOU'VE TRAINED IT IS NOT EASY TO DO A CONTACT INVESTIGATION WHETHER IT'S FOR TUBERCULOSIS OR NOROVIRUS WARS MEASLES. AND TO EXPECT US TO BE ABLE TO SORT OF JUST GO OUT AND HIRE NEW PEOPLE -- IS REALLY TAKES ABOUT TWO YEARS TO BECOME REALLY PROFICIENT AND THAT'S WHY WHAT WE HAVE FOCUSED ON DOING IS TRYING TO PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. AND SUPPORT AS LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TRY TO TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES. THE OTHER DISTURBING AYE ANECDOTALLY OF THERE COUNTIES WHEN DISCUSSING YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO CUT GENERAL FUND USUALLY COMMUNICABLE DISEASES BECAUSE IT IS LARGELY FUNDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BY COUNTY GENERAL FUND -- SAY WELL IT'S OKAY BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T RESPOND THE THE STATE WILL COME WE DON'T HAVE A A WORKFORCE THAT DOES BOOTS ON THE GROUND -- ANSWER THAT JUST HAVING TO DO THAT THE SHELTERS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHERE TO PULL FROM MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE DEPARTMENT. TO IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MOBILIZE A WORK FORCE TO GO IN AND DO A CONTACT AN INVESTIGATION AND IT COMMUNITY THAT WE DON'T KNOW. IS IT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC AND SO -- WE REALLY DO NEED THAT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ROBUST ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN. SO YOU YOU SERVE ANTICIPATE WHAT MY NEXT QUESTION WAS WHICH IS GOING TO BE IS THAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE A LOCALITY. THAT HAS INSUFFICIENT PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF TO DEAL WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AN OUTBREAK -- WELL WHAT DO IT WHAT DO YOU DO. ONE THING THAT HAS HAPPENED -- AND THAT THE THE BOTH -- THE CALIFORNIA COMFORTS OF LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND HEALTH OFFICERS ASSOCIATION CHECK HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT REACHING OUT TO OTHER COUNTIES THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER BY THE WAY IS MOSTLY ALWAYS ONE PERSON IN A SMALL COUNTY AND IT'S EXHAUSTING THAT SOMETIMES THEY'RE WORKING FOR A MILTON YOU'RE. GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU COUNTY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE AND SO OTHER HEALTH OFFICERS WE SHIPS FOR THEM WORK FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN A ROW AND HELP OUT. I'M THAT KIND OF MUTUAL AID IS AT THIS POINT RELATIVELY INFORMAL. BUT IN A IN A LARGE EVIDENT WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY ROBUST IN TERMS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY CAPACITY AT THE DEPARTMENT. SO I DON'T FORESEE A CIRCUMSTANCE -- WHERE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND IT'S GOING TO BE BORROWING FROM EACH OTHER AND POTENTIALLY AS HAS HAPPENED IN NATURAL DISASTERS BORROWING FROM OTHER STATES? PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO DO THE TECHNICAL PARTS PARTICULAR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE THIS HAVE TO DO THAT FRANKLY. AS SERVER SO YES PLEASE PLEASE YES ASSEMBLY. SO COULD YOU GO BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT IT'S NOT THE FUNDING IT'S THE WAY YOU RECEIVE IT. RIGHT SO I'M SPEAKING OUT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OKAY LEVEL WE GOT WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED SEPARATE FUNDING STREAMS ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THEM IS DISEASE OR CONDITION SPECIFIC. AND SO IF YOU HAVE TO DIABETES FUNDING YOU MAY HAVE AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST TO DO THAT. BUT THAT'S ALL THAT PERSON CAN WORK ON EXCEPT FOR THAT FEDERALLY ALLOWABLE 5% FOR EMERGENCIES OR DISASTERS. SO HOW DO YOU SUGGEST WE MAKE THAT BETTER FOR YOU. IT BUT I LIKE I WAS GOING CONVERSATION OKAY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON FRANKLY OKAY I I ALSO I DO THINK THOUGH THAT THERE IS A ROLE -- FOR FOR STATE FUNDING TO KIND OF BRIDGE GAPS -- POTENTIAL A BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE LOOKED INTO AND AT ANY ANY IN ANY DETAIL. IF YOU COMPARE THE DEGREE OF LOW IT GOES INTO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WITH THE AMOUNT OF STATE GENERAL FUND THAT COMES. TO THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT YOU'LL SEE THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER US CHAIR -- SO ACTUALLY THE IT. I ALSO WANT TO SO IN TERMS SO ACTUALLY THIS IS THERE BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS -- AND AND WE SERVE HAVE YOUR SEPARATE PANELS AND I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO THAT IS YOUR BEEN SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM LIKE THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS HAVE -- WHERE WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE -- BUILD UP SOME. I REALIZE THAT REQUIRES SOME RESOURCES BUT BUILD UP SOME BASICALLY SOME EXTRA CAPACITY AND CERTAIN LOCALITIES TO TRY. TO TAKE THAT ONE OKAY HEARD OF US ABOUT HOW THE MEDICAL RESPONSE STRUCTURE AND IN FACT WE DO HAVE A AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES HERE AND I KNOW THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE COUNTIES THAT REALLY JUMPS AND THAT WITH MUTUAL AID -- ASSISTANCE AND SO. PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE BUILT IS TO ALLOW WITHIN EACH REGION COUNTIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO USE EACH OTHER'S RESOURCES AND AND SOME -- REGIONS WE'VE AND DO HAVE AGREEMENT SOMEHOW THEY WILL PAY ONE ANOTHER WHEN THEY COME IN BUT IT IS. A FOR FOR A LONGER EVENT IT DOES REQUIRE DOLLARS BETWEEN. SO I I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS FIFTH TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO SHORE UP THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM BECAUSE THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH EXCESS COULD PASS. RIGHT NOT THE RIGHT WORD RIGHT BUT I MEAN HOW MUCH CAPACITY IS THERE. YOU CAN HAVE A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THAT IS OF VERY LITTLE CAPACITY TO MOVE AROUND I MEAN IT HELPS A LITTLE BIT YEAH SO HOW MUCH SO ANSWERS ESTIMATE ABOUT HOW MUCH. CAPACITY THAT V. L. OBVIOUS YEAH WE WE ALSO SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT OUTBREAK WILL HAPPEN EVERY YEAR BUT THIS YOU KNOW BETTER AND I I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON AT LEAST ONE OR TWO THAT SIGNIFICANT ONES NEARBY Là SMALLER ONES AS AS AS AS AS PRESENTED EARLIER BUT I WE SHOULD. BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT LEVEL OF THE PASSAGE WE HAVE OUT THERE THAT PERHAPS. YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTIES FOR YOU TO TO TO TO BE SURE TO USE THAT VOTE WHAT BASICALLY WHAT THE MINIMUM CAPACITY WE SHOULD HAVE TO OUR MUTUAL AID SAYS. SEVEN SOME ASSESSMENT OF THAT. THERE HASN'T FORMALLY THERE IS THERE A COUPLE OF AREAS WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN. WELL WHEN AREA WHERE WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE A FAIR AMOUNT OF PROGRESS AND THAT'S THE LABORATORY CAPACITY BECAUSE IN OUTBREAKS THOSE HAVE TO SEARCH. AND IN HISTORICALLY IT WAS ONE ONE COUNTY ONE LABORATORY AND THAT'S JUST IT'S WITH NEW LABORATORY TECHNOLOGY NOT FEASIBLE -- AND SO THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODELS OF REGIONAL LABORATORIES IN CALIFORNIA AND SOME OF WHICH ARE VERY -- VERY SUCCESSFUL TYPES OF SUMMER GPA IS SOME ARE -- CONTRACT IS AND ONE THAT'S A THAT'S ACTUALLYWE'VE BEEN. LOOKING AT THOUGHT MORE CONSISTENTLY TO SEE BECAUSE OURS COUNTIES DETERMINED THAT. IT MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH ARE THEY DO HAVE CERTAIN CAPACITIES THAT THEY MUST MAINTAIN. HOW DO WE MAKE THAT POSSIBLE AND SO THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS INTERMITTENTLY IN THE PAST AROUND? COULD WE DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH EPIDEMIOLOGY CAPACITY REGIONAL AS IT WE EVERY TIME THAT WE'VE HAD STARTED THOSE CONVERSATIONS I HAVE NOT BEEN AT THE STATE DURING THAT CONVERSATION BUT AS A LOCAL -- WE RUN INTO CHALLENGES WITH HOW IS IT PAID FOR BECAUSE THE FUNDING. FOR MANY OF THOSE ACTIVITIES COMES FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOES DOWN FROM US TO COUNTIES WE HAVEN'T WE NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE AND IN HOW WE CAN FIND AN ENTITY THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY LEGALLY EXIST LIKE A COLLABORATIVE. AND SO THAT I THINK IS BUT I ALSO THINK THERE'S AN APPETITE FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS OVER TIME. SO DO YOU A THE CITY HAVEN'T PERFORMED ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER DOING. I THINK THAT I AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT WOULD -- WHAT ARE THE CAPACITIES WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE PRESENT IN A CERTAIN RIGHT THE PAST YOU FOR PARTICULAR SPECIFICALLY FOR RESPONSE -- TO AN EVENT. AND I THINK THAT MULTIPLE. MULTIPLE IS YES WHICH IS TO OUR OUR NEW NORM ACTUALLY SO -- THAT IS ACTUALLY THAT SOMETHING I CAN TAKE BACK TO THE CAL FOR COMFORT OF LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS WHICH IS OUR ADVISORY BODY ON THESE ISSUES AND SEE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION -- OUT WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS AND THEN -- WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I THINK THAT IT'S IT IS A DURABLE CONVERSATION WELL I I WOULD TO AND WILL HAVE THE LOCAL HEALTH AUSTRALIA MAY INNER CITY THE AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW I WOULD SUGGEST THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT TO NOT ONLY A CONVERSATION? SO THIS WAY CERTAINLY HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE WE DEPEND ON YOUR EXPERTISE YOU KNOW YOUR EXPERTISE AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT THE EXPERTISE OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. WE NEED YOU TO COME TO US AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. I CAN TRY TO GUESS I CAN TRY SAY I WANT TO OFFER SOMETHING BUT AND I KNOW IT'S NOT THIS REALLY EASY BUT WE NEED YOU TO TELL US WHAT YOU NEED. YEAH WE GOT THE BALLOT SET OFF AGAINST A LOT OF OTHER THINGS BUT IF I DON'T HAVE SOMETHING IN FRONT OF ME TO SAY WELL THIS IS WHAT OUR HEALTH OFFICER SAID. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED THIS IS WHAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO DO WITH THAT RESOURCE WE HAVE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WE DON'T HAVE THEM. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO HELP YOU HELP ME OUT THAT YOU NEED I NEED YOU TO HELP ME HELP YOU SO WE CAN HELP THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA SO I WOULD SUGGEST HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT. YOU NEED. SO THAT WE CAN -- THE BILL TO DO OUR JOBS 8% AT THE END THE LEGISLATURE -- CAN DO THAT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT I I APPRECIATE YOU PERCENT ABOUT H. ONE AND ONE BECAUSE IN OUT A ROOMMATE THAT YOU THAT WAS WHICH HERE AGAIN WAS THAT. THE NINE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND I A REMEMBER -- AT THAT THE WHO'S HERE SECOND OKAY AT THE TIME I WAS NOT THE LEGISLATURE I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THAT MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE THEN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. I DON'T WILL GET ANYBODY IN TROUBLE THE FOR THE ALL THE OFFICER WHO TOLD ME -- THAT. BASICALLY -- THAT WAS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND TOLD AND ACTUALLY WHEN THE OUTBREAK WAS HAPPENING. THAT -- THE ONLY REASON SHE WAS ABLE TO MOBILIZE PEOPLE SHE COULD AT THE COUNTY. WAS A BECAUSE THAT HAPPENED THAT THAT THE EVENT TO THE H. ONE N. ONE THE ISSUE THAT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE. THOSE PEOPLE WHO SHE NEEDED TO USE WERE LAID OFF THEY ARE HAVE THE PINK SLIPS. JERRY HAD THEIR PINK SLIPS THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY OUT BUT THEY STILL HADN'T LEFT YET AND SO SHE SAID SHE WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO MOBILIZE A RESPONSE AND REACH OUT TO ALL THE SCHOOLS WRITERS Là READ SCHOOS THAT WERE INVOLVED AND SO FORTH. AND THAT IS THAT IS THAT THIS IT HAPPENED JUST A COUPLE MONTHS LATER. DO YOU KNOW IF YOU DO. I GUESS YOU A CALLED YOU UP AND SAID -- LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE SITTING AROUND RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT AND THAT'S AN ANYTHING THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE CLASS WAS ASKING THE QUESTION ABOUT I APPRECIATE YOU YOU DRESSED UP LIKE. IT IT THERE AREN'T LIKE IT WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE PEOPLE SITTING AROUND WAITING FOR THE NEXT THING TO HAPPEN AND THEY'RE BUSY DOING OTHER STUFF AND WEAK AND THE ACTORS IN THIS ARMY OF PEOPLE AT THE STATE WHO CAN STEP IN WHEN. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE CUT THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF RIGHT AND AND THAT'S A PARTICULARLY APT -- ISSUE BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER AS A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER SEC HAVING TO ARGUE TO KEEP MY MINIMAL IN MUSICIANS STAFF WHEN THE ARGUMENT AS WELL THEY CAN GET IT PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR IMMUNIZATIONS AT HEALTHCARE FACILITIES PRIMARY CARE CLINICS FQHCS. BUT FQHCS WORK AND WORK AT A MAXIMUM CAPACITY THEY HAVE NO SURGE CAPACITY IF WE LOSE PUBLIC HEALTH'S ABILITY TO SEARCH. THEN WE ARE REALLY GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM IF WE NEED TO VACCINATE PEOPLE OR DISTRIBUTE PILLS OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT COMES. TO THERE ARE WAYS TO WORK AROUND BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BE MAKING IT UP AT THE LAST MINUTE. SALINAS IS OPPOSED BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THAT PEOPLE SAID WELL YOU CAN THEY CAN GET IN OTHER PLACES SO WHAT IS THIS. WE TALK ABOUT SERGIO PASS THE I KNOW WE MAINLY TALK ABOUT GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY STATE LOCAL FEDERAL BUT WHAT IS IT MEAN TO WHAT DEGREE. THE DOES THE PRIVATE SECTOR RULES AND CLINIC. AND SO WHAT BETWEEN IT AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE BETWEEN. HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND PRIVATE ENTITIES ESSENTIALLY AND THEIR ROLE AND AND HELPING OUT WITH SURGERY OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. SO WE WE DO HAVE A ROOM A VOLUNTEER SYSTEM AND WE HAVE A SERIES OF MEDICAL RESERVE COURSE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ON WHO CAN STEP AND THEY TRAIN BUT IT'S ALSO WE'RE THEY ALL HAVE JOBS. TO RIGHT AND SO IF IT'S A SITUATION WHERE THE MEDICAL SIDE IS ALSO IMPACT IT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE NEEDED IN THEIR HOSPITALS OR THEIR CLINICS YOUR WORK SORT OF ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL -- AND SO ALTHOUGH WE DO TRAIN PEOPLE AND FOR SMALLER AMOUNTS AND SHORTER EVENTS I THINK YOU KNOW LIKE AT THE BUTTE COUNTY -- SHELTERS WHERE MANY. PEOPLE DID VOLUNTEER NOT ONLY THEM ARE SEES BUT HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY BROUGHT PEOPLE TO THE TABLE IN A SMALL OF AN TO SHORT TERM EVENT THAT IS THERE AND CAN BE HELPFUL. BUT I THINK WHEN LAST AND IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE INTO HEALTHCARE AND SURGING THERE IT'S DIFFICULT WITH A LOT OF RULES ABOUT WHO CAN AND CAN'T COME INTO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES DO YOU. PRACTICE BUT IT'S PRETTY LIKELY THAT IN ANY EVENT LIKE PAN BIKE A PANDEMIC THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF BAND WITH BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF THEIR OWN PATIENTS. THERE IS SINCE EACH ONE AND WHEN THERE'S A NEW PHENOMENON WELL NEW AS OF THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS I HAVE WHICH IS THERE ARE PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT DO SPECIFICALLY MASS VACCINATION SO THEY HAVE LARGE CADRES OF NURSES WHO WORK FOR THEM THAT CAN GO ANYWHERE. IN THE STATE THE THING IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TO HIRE THEM TO COME IN. BUT I HAVE DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUALLY. OKAY. AND ACTUALLY -- AT OUR CHAVEZ AID -- DID YOU TALK ABOUT THE INCREASING NUMBER OF REPORTS INFECTIONS I MEAN 45% -- HAS YOUR STAFF INCREASED BY 45% -- TO TAKE ALL THESE REPORTS ARE. HOW HOW'S THAT GOING -- ACTUALLY. YES THEY SAID YOU KNOW FIRST THOSE REPORTS FIRST COME TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT RIGHT THEY DO HAVE TO REVIEW EVERYONE OF THEM AND FREQUENTLY RESPOND TO WHAT THEY FIND. AND NOT HAVE THEY JUST NOT HADAN INCREASE BUT AS YOU HEARD ALMOST EVERYONE OF THEM HAS HAD A DECREASING PERSONNEL SO. I FREQUENTLY THAT TASK TAKES A BIG PART OF THEIR STOPPING JUST MAINTAINING WITH THE INCREASING NUMBER OF OF REPORT A WE SING A LAGAN RESPONSES THIS IS GOING ON WITH. THERE WERE REPORTS AND FEWER PEOPLE ANYWHERE HAVING DELAYS THAT WE ARE DOING THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN HELPFUL HIS IS LEVERAGING IT TECHNOLOGIES SO THAT WE CAN AUTOMATE AS MUCH OF THAT US AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. SO NOW WE HAVE A YOU KNOW AND ELECTRONICAL OVER ANOTHER TWENTY CLUB REPORTING SYSTEM -- FOR A REPORT FROM LABORATORIES TO COME ELECTRONIC GREEN TO OUR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MANUALLY. ENTER AND PROCESS THAT INFORMATION. I AND WE'RE MOVING ACTUALLY TOWARDS DOING THE SAME THING WITH ELECTRONIC CASE REPORTING SO THAT WE CAN MIND ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS SIMPLE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION OUT. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO HAVE PEOPLE FILL OUT SPECIFIC FORMS SO WE TRIED TO BE SMART TO USING NEW TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WE CAN COMPENSATE FOR THE OR THE LACK OF RESOURCES AND AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN ACTUALLY EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. AND CAN YOU SPEAK YOU MENTION TECHNOLOGY YOUR ABILITY TO YOUR DATA CAPACITY ABILITY TO INTERFACE WITH LIKE EHRS AND OTHER PRIVATE -- YOU KNOW LEAD DATA SETS -- TO HELP YOU ADDRESS ANY WHAT WHERE DID THE THE NEEDS TO FOR FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE ABLE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK SO OUR FIRST -- A PLAN TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE A STATEWIDE HEALTH SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO ANY GIVEN DISEASE BUT ACCESS CAPABILITY TO AS AS DOCTOR CHAVIS SAYS. REACH INTO EMR SIMPLE BECAUSE PASSIVE REPORTING OF THAT TIME IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EXPECTING PHYSICIANS ENTER DATA. RIGHT NOW WE'RE BUILDING THE COR CAPACITY FOR THAT AND WE'RE BUILDING IN OUR OPERABILITY WITHIN OUR MANY DISEASE REGISTRIES BECAUSE SOME OF THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IN PUTTING GOING INTO THESE LEGACIES. WE ARE CURRENTLY LEVERAGING -- OPIOID MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TRY -- TO ADVANCE THAT IT REQUIRES ENTERING INTO DO USE AGREEMENTS WITH A VARIETY OF ENTITIES. AND WE'RE JUST BEGINNING THAT PROCESS I THINK WE HAVE A VERY REALISTIC PLAN I'M CONCERNED THOUGH -- THE NEW AT THIS WE JUST GOT THE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE NEW OPIATE GRANT IS IT'S BEEN DECREASED-SUBSTANTIALLY -- SO IT'S AGAIN IT'S AN ISSUE OF SUSTAINED FUNDING I THINK THAT DOT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION PARTICULARLY WITH THE ADVANCED ANALYTICS CAPABILITY THAT WE'VE ALSO BUILT IN. IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL AND US FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WHAT CAPACITY DO WE ACTUALLY NEED -- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD OVER VIEW -- OF THE THE BIGGER PICTURE FRANKLY. AND I SHOULD ACT SERVICE I KNOW THAT YOU WERE VERY INVOLVED IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN MEASLES OUTBREAK -- KEY PERHAPS SPEAK THE AS AN EXAMPLE -- TO WHAT EXTENT PEOPLE GOT PULLED OFF OF RIGHT WHAT TASKS GOT. NAKED I'VE NEGLECTED MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT WORD BUT BASICALLY -- BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE PULLED TO TRUST THAT OUTBREAK -- WE KNOW THAT OVER A HUNDRED NINETEEN HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PEOPLE DIED FACT ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAD TO TOUCH IN ORDER TO CONTAIN THAT OUTBREAK AND DO YOU HAVE A ROUGH ESTIMATE I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SALUTE FOR BUT OF HOW MUCH THAT. ENDED UP COSTING THE STATE JUST RESPONDED THAT ONE OUTBREAK -- DICKEY KIKI WRAPS. AS AS A CASE EXAMPLE OF A I GUESS THAT WOULD BE WHAT AND A AND A LARGER MEDIUM SIZED -- EVENTS. US ACTUALLY A FAIRLY SMALL EVENT OKAY THAT'S A SMALL IT'S A HOW MUCH OF THAT INVOLVED OKAY IT'S A SMALL THAT BALANCE THAT INVOLVED AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MUCH MONEY ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF ON THE LAST. AS YOU KNOW MEASLES BEING ONE OF THE MOST A CONTAGIOSUM AFFECTIONS -- IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO IDENTIFY CASES AND TO PREVENT SUBSEQUENT CASE AND AND WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE MEASLES OUTBREAK. IN ORANGE COUNTY PARTICULARLY IS THAT. YOU KNOW FOR EVERYONE CASE THAT WE IDENTIFIED WE IDENTIFIED DOZENS AND DOZENS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE EXPOSED THAT AND HOW TO BE INTERRED FOUND AN INTERVIEW -- AND AND PROFIT LOCKED AND VERY QUICKLY JUST ARE JUST GOING INTO. A HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WE HAD ONE SITUATION JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THE COMPLEXITY OF DOING DAYS WHERE WE HAD -- IN A NEONATE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT -- THERE WAS -- THE DATA ONE OF THE MOMS WHO CAME TO VISIT THE GRANDSON. AND HE HAD MEASLES AS PART OF THE OUTBREAK -- AND SO THEN WE HAVE A NO NO JUST THE DODD BUTTON ENTIRE AN ICY YOU'LL BABIES -- EXPOSED AND AS YOU IMAGINE THEY'RE VERY HIGH RISK RIGHT OUR AND SO HE REALLY REQUIRED ALL HANDS ON DECK FROM THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT PERSPECTIVE AND THANKFULLY WE HAD. ZERO ADDITIONAL CASES FROM THAT EXPOSURE. BUT THAT MEANS THAT THE COUNTY BASICALLY HOW TO STOP EVERYTHING THEY WERE DOING -- BUT ON DAY TO DAY BASIS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND -- I KNOW WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION -- IN TERMS OF US NEEDING TO BE BETTER UP ACCOUNTING. FOR RESOURCES ARE SPENT ON THESE OUTBREAKS ARE PARTICULARLY TRYING TO DO A PRO PROSPECTIVELY SO THAT WE CAN BETTER ACCOUNT AND WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON ON THAT FOR FUTURE OUTBREAKS. YOUR THROAT AND A ROUGH NUMBER FOR HOW MUCH THAT MEASLES OUTBREAK COST I THINK SOMEONE. YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS ALSO FROM WHAT ANGLE YOU SEE IT I MEAN THE COSTS ARE AMONG THE STATE. AND LOCAL HEALTH YEAH I THINK THAT LOW YET COST FOR LOCAL HELP THE OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH PARTS OF STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NOT THE COST FOR HOSPITALIZATION FOR PEOPLE WHO GOT SICK AND SO FORTH JUST JUST THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH COST I THINK I DON'T HAVE IF. YOU'RE A NEW BUT I KNOW WE'VE DONE SOME ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE LOCAL YOU KNOW WHAT. GIVE ME A NUMBER A ROUGH NUMBER NOW I MEAN WE'RE TALKING MILLIONS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MILLIONS SO MILLIONS WERE TALKING OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THIS. SMALL USED TO SAID WITH A SMALL DENT. OKAY MILLIONS ALL RIGHT ALAMEDA COUNTY WHICH WAS NOT THE EPICENTER OUTBREAK ESTIMATED THAT IT COSTS THEM ON THE ORDER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN STAFF TIME. TO RESTORE MILLION IN ONE COUNTY THAT'S TRUE. WILD WRONG I WILL MAKE SURE THAT OKAY BUT THAT'S THE NUMBER THE STICKS IN MY MIND BECAUSE I GIVE A TALK ON THAT VERY THE VERY FACT HOW DESTRUCTIVE THE SET EPIDEMIC RIGHT ARE. BUT ALSO THINKING ADD THIS EVENT IN THE NICK YOU -- YOU SAID EVERYTHING STOPPED SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT S. T. D. ONGOING A CD PROBLEMS THAT MEAN PEOPLE GOT PULLED AWAY FROM DOING A CD WORK IN THAT COUNTY WHILE THIS MEASLES OUTBREAK HAPPENED. SO I MEAN THERE IS ONE RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING THAT THESE THINGS ARE INTERLINKED RIGHT WE HAVE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I MEAN THAT'S NOT THE THING THAT'S NECESSARY ON THE NEWS ALL THE TIME IT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS BUT YOU KNOW IT'S ON GOING. STD THING GOING ON THE PROBLEM GOING ON SO THAT MEANS PEOPLE GOT PULLED AWAY. TO TAKE CARE OF THIS THING PEOPLE GOT PULLED AWAY FROM OTHER TYPES OF NOLLIE DISEASE OUTBREAKS PROBABLY CHRONIC THAT. ENDING A GAP SO EVERYONE EVER GOT PULLED INTO BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T GET ON TOP OF THIS LIKE A FIRE RIGHT IF YOU DON'T JUMP ON TOP OF IT IT'S GOING. TO CONTINUE XCELERATED SPREAD. AND BUT MEANTIME THAT MEANS WERE NEGLECTING. NEGLECT IS NOT QUITE THE RIGHT WORD BUT AND YET PRIORITIZE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT MEANT THAT. WE HAD THE MORE VIDEO WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR CITIES WERE NOT TAKEN CARE OF MAYBE SOME NON VISITING PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE OTHER TYPES OF PREVENTION PROGRAMS [inaudible] OKAY WELL. SLIDE TO OKAY. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SO OUR NEXT PANEL IS OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ROLE INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES IN ADDRESSING OUTBREAKS AND WE'VE OF COURSE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE VERY IMPORTANT. NOT JUST VERY IMPORTANT ESSENTIAL ROLLER LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PLAY. AND SO WE HAVE -- SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR PANEL WE HAVE ROB TOLD HIM HIS THE FASTER COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR HIS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE LOOK. VASE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSIBILITIES LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS -- ADMINISTER AND HOW TO CONTRAST WITH THE STATE ROLE WE HAVE I KIM. SIR -- WITH HARLEY'S HELP THE PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY OKAY THANK YOU THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR WHO'S GONNA BE TALK ABOUT MERGERS HE PREPAREDNESS. AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT EACH OF YOU DO ALL THIS STUFF BY HAVING EACH OF YOU FOCUS ON PARTICULAR THINGS. WE HAVE ANY MILLARD THE BUTTE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE'S GOT TALK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE WILD FIRES AND SO WITH THE TIMER TO SEE AND THEN -- DOCTOR SHERRIN -- BALZER FROM THE LOS ANGELES APART PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR OF THE VISION COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL TALKING ABOUT HEPATITIS A WHICH OF COURSE HAS BEEN A THE ISSUE -- AS WELL SO -- WHAT WE GO AHEAD AND START OFF WITH DOCTOR OLDHAM TO GIVE A CERTAIN THE OVERVIEW ON THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IF YOU LOOK? AT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN PAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR ROB OLDHAM AND I'M THE HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR PLASTER COUNTY. AND ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS ARE C. SEELEY JOE AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THERE'S A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOR EVERY COUNTING KLAY LONG BEACH IN PASADENA. EACH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSURING THE SUCCESSFUL LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION OF CORE PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES. WHAT ARE SOME VARIATION BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS AS TO HOW WE FULFILL THIS RESPONSIBILITY IN ALMOST EVERY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT YOU'LL FIND SOME OF THE SAME QUIRK PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS? SO FOR EXAMPLE OF ITS WAS DESCRIBED EARLIER -- COMMUNITY DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS CAN TO CONDUCT SURVEILLANCE FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CASES AND OUTBREAKS SO IN PLASTER COUNTY. OUR TEAM OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF COMMUNITY THESE STAFF RECEIVE NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND CASE REPORTS EVERY YEAR. IDEALLY WE INTERVIEW EVERY PERSON SUSPECTED OF HAVING THE COMMUNITY DISEASE CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS IDENTIFY LIKELY SOURCES OF EXPOSURE TO THE ILLNESS AND OTHER PEOPLE EXPOSED THAT WE CAN RECOMMEND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. ANOTHER OUTBREAK CONTROL MEASURES HOWEVER DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES WE'RE OFTEN NOT ABLE TO DO AS IN DEPTH AND AND THAT INVESTIGATIONS WOULD LIKE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE AS WAS MENTIONED BY DOCTOR CHAVEZ BEFORE ABOUT -- SIX ACTUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS WE'VE SEEN DRAMATIC INCREASES AND THE RATES OF CASES IN RECENT YEARS. SOME OTHER PROGRAMS -- IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT TO LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SCHOOLS AND OTHERS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF SAFE AND AFFORDABLE VACCINES AND TO IMPROVE IMMUNIZATION RATES. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PROGRAMS PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF PARTNERSHIPS PLANS TRAININGS DRILLS AND EXERCISES. BUY RECORDS REGISTERS ALL BIRTH MATERNAL CHILD ADOLESCENT HEALTH PROGRAMS PROVIDE SUPPORT SUCH AS HOMEOWNERS HOME VISITS CASE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE LINKAGES. TO AT RISK FAMILIES. CRIME DISEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS WORK TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF DISEASES LIKE DIABETES HEART LUNG DISEASE AND OBESITY BY PROMOTING MORE HEALTHFUL LIFESTYLES AND COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTS. THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM PROVIDES DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT SERVICES MEDICAL CASE MANAGEMENT AND PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY TO CHILDREN WITH ELIGIBLE MELT MEDICAL CONDITIONS. THIS PROGRAM PROGRAM IS A GODSEND TO MANY FAMILIES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. THE CHILD HEALTH DISABILITY PREVENTION PROGRAM DELIVERS PERIODIC HEALTH ASSESSMENTS CARE COORDINATION OTHER SERVICES TO ASSIST CHILDREN FAMILIES WITH THINGS LIKE MEDICAL APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING AND TRANSPORTATION. THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE PROVIDES PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE EXPERTISE IN MEETING MEDICAL DENTAL MENTAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE -- SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT YOU'LL FIND IN ALMOST EVERY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. MANY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ALSO OVERSEE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH WERE ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM FOOD INSPECTIONS TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. SOME LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ALSO OPERATOR OVERSEE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS ANIMAL CONTROL SHELTERS PUBLIC HOSPITALS MEDICAL CLINICS JAIL MEDICAL SERVICES HOMELESSNESS SERVICES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION PROGRAMS. AND WHILE I KNOW YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM TO MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT FUNDING CHALLENGES LATER IN TODAY'S MEETING IT'S IMPORTANT AS A SAID BEFORE TO NOTE THAT MUCH OF THIS WORK IS DONE WITH LIMITED AND RESTRICTIVE CATEGORICAL FUNDING. THAT OFTEN IS NOT COVER THE FULL COST OF RUNNING MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS IS OFTEN NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THE UNIQUE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING NEEDS LOCAL. PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. OUR WORK REQUIRES A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH CITY PH -- HOWEVER THE ULTIMATELY UP TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO MEET THE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE -- C. PH HAS A FABULOUS CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES THE DOCTOR CHAVEZ LEADS -- THEY PROVIDE A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WITH EXPERT GUIDANCE AND CONSULTATION ON SOME OF OUR MOST CHALLENGING CASES SUCH AS CASES OF MULTI DRUG RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS. HOWEVER REMAINS UP TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE PERSON THE TV. OFTEN THAT MEANS LITERALLY GOING THE PERSON FOR WORK TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE TAKING THEIR MEDICATIONS AS PRESCRIBED NOT HAVING ANY ANY SIDE EFFECTS. IN A SIMILAR WAY -- C. PH HAS AN OUTSTANDING CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS AND INFORMATICS THAT HAS SPEARHEADED THE CREATION OF A CUTTING EDGE SYSTEM FOR BIRTH AND DEATH REGISTRATION. HOWEVER IT'S UP TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO ACTUALLY INTERACT WITH OUR LOCAL PARENTS FUNERAL HOME DIRECTORS HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS OFFICES TO MAKE SURE THE CORRECT INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY ENTERED IN THIS NEWS NEW SYSTEM. AND THESE RECORDS ARE THEN PROVIDED TO OUR RESIDENTS IN A TIMELY FASHION. SO IN SUMMARY OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SURVEY CRITICAL FUNCTION FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE. THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NOBODY ELSE REALLY DOES WHAT WE DO. THINGS ARE GOING WELL OUR WORK S LARGELY IN THE BACKGROUND TOO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE OFTEN SERVE SOME OF OUR NEEDIEST RESIDENTS OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY BENEFITS FROM A STRONG LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES RETAIN THESE VITAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES AND PROTECTIONS. ON EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION OF THE COMMITTEE FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING ON OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE THANKS THANK. HAVE TO OF THAT RIGHT NOW. YEP THERE WE GO OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR SENATOR LEYVA MY NAME IS KIM SORRY WHAT SORRY AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY. I SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER FOCUSING ON EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND I HELPED ESTABLISH AND LEAD THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND ADDRESSING OUTBREAKS IN PREPARING FOR EMERGENCIES. WHEN YOU CONSIDER OUR GLOBAL SOCIETY AND THE ABILITY OF DISEASES TO SPREAD WORLDWIDE IN A MATTER OF DAYS PREPAREDNESS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT? SINCE NINE ELEVEN AND THE ANTHRAX ATTACKS OF TWO THOUSAND ONE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HAVE WORKED TO DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO BIOTERRORISM. LARGE SCALE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND NATURAL DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE DEVELOPED A STATEWIDE OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR RESPONDING TO PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. YOUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO THE LYNCH PIN OF THE SYSTEM AND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH. WE SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME WRITING RESPONSE PLANS TRAINING STAFF AND PRACTICING HOW TO RESPOND TO LARGE SCALE DISASTERS. WITH THAT SAID AS YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE. THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF. INCLUDING WELL TRAINED DOCTORS NURSES EPIDEMIOLOGIST LABORATORY ENDS DISEASE INVESTIGATORS AND OTHERS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK. FUNDING SHORTAGES OF COST REDUCTIONS IN STAFFING LEVELS IN MANY AREAS WELL THIS IS HAMPERED OUR DAILY CAPACITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IT'S EVEN MORE CRITICAL WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF PANDEMICS. NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EMERGENCIES AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY LIKE IN MANY OTHER COUNTIES EVERYONE OF OUR HOSPITALS HAS A CACHE OF DISASTERS SUPPLIES THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WITH GRANT FUNDS. WE MAINTAIN A STOCKPILE OF ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTI BY RULES FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. WE HAVE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT GENERATORS VENTILATORS AND SUPPLIES FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO SEARCH TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND FOR PATIENTS. ALL THIS IN ABOUT A TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT WAREHOUSE. WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER TO COORDINATE ALL OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL ACTIVITIES. BUT THE SYSTEM IS REALLY IN PLACE TO HANDLE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED INCIDENTS THAT ARE RELATIVELY SHORT IN DURATION. FOR EXAMPLE IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER ORDERED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS AND STAFF BE TESTED -- AT A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL AFTER MULTIPLE STUDENTS AND BEEN EXPOSED TO TUBERCULOSIS. SO WE USE THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM STRUCTURE AND EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER TO COORDINATE RESOURCES AND THE TESTING WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED IN JUST TWO DAYS. WELL TRAINED PEOPLE CAN RESPOND TO ANY INCIDENT THE GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF STAFF THE LONGER THE DURATION OF THE INCIDENT. THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE TO HAVE A SUSTAINED AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSE. YOU ALWAYS HEAR FROM PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT WE NEED MORE MONEY FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO IMPROVE OUR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. WELL THIS IS TRUE THE REAL BENEFIT IS THAT THE PERSONNEL CAN BE TRAINED TO RESPOND TO SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCIES THAT STRETCH BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF OUR EXISTING STAFF. PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF WILL BE CALLED TO OPERATE BACKS NATION SITES. SUPPORT LOCATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE CONDUCTED SPECIMENS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF DISEASE. EVEN WITH ALL OF OUR RESPONSE PLANS ARE TRAINING IN OUR PRACTICE EXERCISES WE CANNOT PREDICT THE NEXT EMERGING DISEASE THAT WILL PRESENT NEW CHALLENGES AND INCREASE OUR WORKLOAD. DISEASE CONTROL STAFF SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS PREPARING FOR THE POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF DISEASES LIKE SECA ANY BOLEH AND THE RE EMERGENCE OF DISEASES LIKE MEASLES. OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PREPARED. YES THEY ARE PREPARED TO RESPOND WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TRAINING AND PASSION TO DO THE WORK. DO THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO A LARGE SCALE LONG TERM PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY NO NOT WITH OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THIS IS WHY CRITICAL ONGOING INVESTMENT INTO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE VITAL AND WE URGE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF STRENGTHENING THAT CAPACITY THE LOCAL LEVEL. THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR AND AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDY MILLER ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER FOR BUTTE COUNTY. I WAS INVITED HERE TO DESCRIBE OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO DISASTERS -- AND I'M GONNA USE THE EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD IN THE NOVEMBER EIGHT CAMPFIRE TO TRIED. TO SEDATE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES. I REALIZE THAT OUR COUNTY IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS -- AND DO THAT CAPACITIES MAY BE DIFFERENT AND IF ANYBODY WANTS A MORE EXHAUSTIVE LOOK INTO IT THERE ARE A GREAT DOCUMENTS OUT THERE. I THINK THE COMMITTEE HAS A ONE PAGE DOCUMENT FROM THE M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ACT&lt;/c&gt;</u> WHICH IS THE MEDICAL HELP OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR. DANIEL THAT DESCRIBES THE SEVENTEEN ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE MARK AND JUST TO OVER SIMPLIFY YOU CAN PROBABLY JUST SAY THOSE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES MOSTLY THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OVER YOU SEE. SOME OTHER ENTITIES INVOLVED SO I'M GONNA TALK QUICKLY ABOUT -- PUBLIC HEALTH IN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS DISASTER RESPONSE AND DISASTER RECOVERY WITH MOST OF THAT BEING IN RESPONSE. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS WHICH WOULD WARRANT AT ABOUT -- I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THE TIME TO TO GO IN GREAT DEPTH BUT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE RESPONSES LARGELY DICTATED BY THE PLANS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS. AND THE CREATIVE THINKING THAT TAKES PLACE DURING PREPAREDNESS PREPAREDNESS IS REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT WE RECEIVE FUNDING. FOR NOT FOR RESPONSE AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. SO IN DISASTER RESPONSE I'M GONNA GO QUICKLY THROUGH. OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IN EVACUATION SHELTERING INFECTION CONTROL ANIMAL SHELTERING AND SOME OTHER HEALTH RELATED ISSUES -- SO START WITH EVACUATION ON NOVEMBER EIGHT THAT -- AT EIGHT OO SEVEN IN THE MORNING. I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE ORIGINAL DISASTER MEDICAL HEALTH SPECIALIST ASKING FOR FIVE AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAMS TO COME INTO OUR COUNTY TO EVACUATE AND VETS ADVENTIST FOR THE RIVER HOSPITAL. THAT'S TWENTY FIVE AMBULANCES EACH STRIKE TEAM HAS. FIVE THAT WAS QUICKLY APPROVED AND THE DISCUSSION THROUGHOUT THE DAY BROUGHT IN AIR AMBULANCES AND A NUMBER OF OTHER. RESOURCES INTO THE COUNTY I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MALL ACT IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT ESSENTIALLY. TO REQUEST OUT OF STICTION WHEN IT COMES -- TO EVACUATION. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT I ASSISTED A GREAT DEAL IN HELPING LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND SNAPS NOW LEGALLY IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE A PLAN AND TO EVACUATE. BUT WE KNOW FROM PREVIOUS FIRES ESPECIALLY PREVIOUS FIRES IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE. THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE SO VERY QUICKLY THAT MORNING. WE CONTACTED ARE MAPPED. AND TOOK THE STATUS OF ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES AND ULTIMATELY -- SENT AMBLIN STRIKE TEAMS TO SIX OF THEM AND FORTUNATELY THROUGH THOSE EFFORTS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER EFFORTS-- NO LIVES WERE LOST IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES ARE SNIFFS IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE WHICH IS OUR ONE OF THE FEW SILVER LININGS. ADDITIONALLY WE GET INVOLVED IN THE EVACUATION OF ANIMALS WE HAVE TRAINED STAFF PEOPLE NOT LEAVE WITHOUT THEIR ANIMALS. SO WE'VE LEARNED WE NEED TO HAVE STRAINED TRAINED STAFF THAT ARE BEHIND. LAW ENFORCEMENT LINES AND FIRE LINE SOMETIMES WELL TRAINED IN ORDER TO REMOVE ANIMALS FROM THE AREA NEXT YEAR IS SHELTERING. ARE IN SHELTERS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN CONCERT WITH THE RED CROSS TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SUPPORT. AT THE AT KIND OF THE XENA IN FIVE OF FISH I'M SORRY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE IN FIVE OFFICIAL SHELTERS AND MANY MORE PEOPLE IN UNOFFICIAL SHELTERS. WE ESSENTIALLY PROVIDED STAFFING THAT WAS PHYSICIANS. NURSES AND LOGISTICS PEOPLE ARE FOR ALL OF THOSE SHELTERS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY FOR THREE MONTHS. I THAT INCLUDED PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF INITIALLY LOCAL VOLUNTEERS LOCAL DOCTORS COMING FROM ALL OVER PEOPLE WE KNEW FRIENDS WE KNEW CALLING THEM -- OTHER LOCAL VOLUNTEERS ARE ULTIMATELY MANY OUTSIDE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS AND MANY OF OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS AS YOU HEARD EARLIER. ADDITIONALLY FOR THOSE SHELTERS WE ARE SUPPLYING THEM AS IF WE ARE THEIR HOSPITAL SUPPLIER. WITH HELP BRINGING AN OXYGEN RESPIRATORY MEDICATIONS MET MEDICATIONS LOS DURABLE METAL MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WHEELCHAIRS WALKERS. AND JUST EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN A HOSPITAL OR A CLINIC HOW IS SENSUALLY STAFFED AND SUPPLIED A GROUP OF TWENTY FOUR HOUR URGENT CARE CLINICS FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS. WE ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR FEEDING AND HOUSING ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT COME IN TO HELP US. WHICH SHOWS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY HOUSING IN YOUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN BY FIRE AND AND OTHER HELPERS IS HARD. ANOTHER AREAS INFECTION CONTROL YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT NOROVIRUS THIS ALSO REQUIRE SHELTERING DURING THE INFLUENZA SEASON. LOTS OF WORK WAS DONE BY LOCAL AND STATE AND SOME FEDERAL RESOURCES TO TRY TO CONTROL THOSE WE HAD STAFF VISITING EACH SHELTER UPON ITS OPENING. AND PRETTY MUCH DAILY THEREAFTER TO HELP ENFORCE AND REINFORCE INFECTION CONTROL MESSER MEASURES WITH SOME STATE HELP I THE NEXT IS ANIMAL SHELTER SHELTERING IN BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; COUNTY&lt;/c&gt; ANIMAL CONTROL IS HOUSED IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AT ITS ZENITH WE WERE HELPING TEN THOUSAND ANIMALS. SIX THOUSAND OF THEM WERE SHELTERED IN PLACE IN FIRE AREAS FOUR THOUSAND IN SHELTERS WE HAD SIX HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS EACH DAY HELPING TO SUPPORT THOSE. ANIMALS TWENTY TONS OF ANIMAL FEED EACH DAY SEVENTY FIVE TEAMS IN THE FIELD FIFTY TEAMS WORKING IN SHELTERS REALIZE THAT OUR LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL STAFF IS. TWELVE AND MANY OF THEM LOST THEIR HOMES. SO THERE'S SOME OTHER HEALTH RELATED RESPONSE ACTIVITIES AIR QUALITY OF PUTTING OUT ADVISORIES WATER QUALITY TOXIC EXPOSURES AND GIVING ADVISORIES AS PEOPLE ARE MOVING BACK INTO BURN SCAR AREAS. SO NOW MOVES THE LAST IS DISASTER RECOVERY WHICH WERE STILL LEARNING ABOUT REALLY IN ALL HONESTY -- DEBRIS CLEANUP AS REQUIRED MORE AND MORE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH -- INVOLVEMENT AS THE RENTS HAVE GOTTEN LARGER AND AS A DIFFERENT REGULATORY. DEVELOPMENTS HAVE OCCURRED ONE IS THAT CALORIE ASSN FEMA HAVE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO BRING CLEAN UP CREWS IN AND TO PAY FOR THAT FOR THERE TO BE DECLARATIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. ARE AND ADVISORIES AND THAT ALL DISASTERS ARE ESSENTIALLY LOCAL AND THAT PEOPLE COME IN AND HELP BUT IT'S REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO GIVE FINAL APPROVAL. ON REBUILDING ON A LOT AND WE HAVE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM. I AND TO GET LEGAL RIGHT OF ENTRY FORMS AND WE HAVE ELEVEN OUT THOUSAND OF THEM SO FAR THEY HAVE BEEN PROCESSED. THE LAST IS HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH AGAIN WE ARE ONLY STARTING TO DEAL WITH WE LOST A HOSPITAL WE LOST MOST OF THE DOCTORS IN THE THAT WERE WORKING IN THAT HOSPITAL. WE LOST OUR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITY BEDS WE ARE NOT A LARGE COMMUNITY WE DON'T HAVE THOSE BETS. ARE THE HOSPITALS ARE HOLDING ON TO PATIENTS -- FOR ABOUT THIRTY DAYS TO TRY TO FIND PLACEMENT OFTEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS GIVE KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES DURING A DISASTER -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL THIS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY WORK IS DONE WITHOUT SPECIFIC BUDGETARY RESOURCE ALL ROUTINE PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS SUFFER FROM AN ATTENTION AS YOU'VE HEARD. DURING THESE EVENTS. THERE'S REALLY NO CHOICE I IN OUR COUNTY WE HAD TWO PEOPLE DEDICATED TO EMERGE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ONE OF WHOM LOST THEIR HOM. AND WAS MOVED OUT OF THE AREA AND WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN THE RESPONSE WE ESSENTIALLY HAD ONE PERSON. TO TRY TO DO THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE SO IS EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YOU THANK YOU. IN FACT ABOUT I THANK YOU MY NAME IS DOCTOR SHARON FALTER I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. AT THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SHARE THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED FROM THE RECENT HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK AMONG PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT THINGS TO THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF OUR STAFF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN STOPPING THIS OUTBREAK. BUT OUR RESPONSE SHOWED AREAS OF VULNERABILITY. IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WITH HUNDREDS OF CASES OF HEPATITIS A IN SAN DIEGO AND AN OUTBREAK IN SANTA CRUZ AND FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMELESS PERSONS IN OUR COUNTY. DPH WAS ACUTELY AWARE THAT WE WERE AT SERIOUS RISK OF AN OUTBREAK. HEPATITIS A IS A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS OF THE LIVER. IT SPREAD FROM PERSON TO PERSON THROUGH THE FECAL ORAL ROUTE. THE VIRUS CAN LIVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SURFACES FOR NEXT SPEND AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME HOWEVER IT IS PREVENTABLE WITH GOOD SANITATION AND VACCINATION. PERSONS LIVING IN HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ARE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEPATITIS C. OUTBREAKS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TOILETS IN HAND WASHING FACILITIES. RESIDENTS LIVE IN CLOSE QUARTERS AND RESPECT YOURS FOR EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SUCH AS DRUG USE CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPREAD OF HEPATITIS SAY. PRISONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS CAN ALSO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REACH AND PROTECT. OUR IN PART BECAUSE THEY HAVE OTHER MEDICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESSORS THE PREVENT THEM FROM SEEKING PREVENTIVE CARE WERE DELAY CARE WHEN THEY BECOME ILL. IN LA COUNTY WE BENEFITED FROM THE EARLY LESSONS IN SAN DIEGO AND SANTA CRUZ. EFFORTS TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY AND RESPOND IMPORTED TO THE COUNTY MAY HAVE BEEN KEY IN PREVENTING A SIGNIFICANT OUTBREAK. WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY OUTREACH ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKING WITH THESE PARTNERS DISTRIBUTED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND VACCINES. AND WORK TO IMPROVE THESE A SANITARY CONDITIONS IN THE ENCAMPMENTS WHICH MANAGED TO KEEP CASES TO A MINIMUM THIS TIME. THE OUTBREAK WHICH INCLUDED MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED CASES IN TWENTY ONE THE STATE WIDE HOWEVER ILLUSTRATES THE CRITICAL NEED FOR FUNDING. TO SUPPORT BASIC HUMAN NEEDS ADEQUATE HOUSING AND SANITATION. AMONG OUR HOMELESS CITIZENS THERE'S ALSO A NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND SOCIAL SUPPORT SERVICES. AT POINTS WE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR RECOUP PART OF CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS WHO WERE SOMETIMES DISCHARGED WHILE INFECTIOUS BACK TO ENCAMPMENTS WHICH POTENTIALLY FURTHER THE SPREAD OF INFECTION. OUR DEPARTMENT MOUNTED AN AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE BY MOVING STAFF FROM THEIR REGULAR POSITIONS TO EMERGENCY WORK FROM JULY OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THROUGH MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN DURING THIS TIME NON AS THE WORK SLOWED OR STOPPED ALL TOGETHER. A VERY SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCE WAS A DELAY IN BASIC PROCUREMENT WHICH LED TO SHORTAGES IN LABORATORY AND CLINICAL SUPPLIES LATER IN THE YEAR. THERE WAS AN EXTREME TOLL ON OUR WORKFORCE WHO WORKED OVERTIME FOR MANY MANY WEEKS IF WE'D HAD ANOTHER OUTBREAK AT THE SAME TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY VULNERABLE. ONE OF THE STRONGEST TOOLS IN ADDRESSING AN EPIDEMIC IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY WE FOUND TO DURING OUR HEPATITIS A RESPONSE THAT SOME HOSPITALS WERE BATCHING OR SENDING OUT. TESTS WHICH DELAYED CRITICAL DIAGNOSTICS SO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY STEPPED IN TO PROVIDE REAL TIME TESTING FOR THESE FACILITIES. FOR SOME DISEASES SUCH AS BOTULISM EBOLA ONLY THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY CAN DO THE TESTING. THE US PUBLIC HEALTH LABS MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH ADEQUATE FUNDING. ADDITIONALLY IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS PARAMOUNT AND THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF ELECTRONIC LABORATORY REPORTING EARLIER AND IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. HOWEVER DURING THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK OCCASIONS THE ENTIRE AEO OUR SYSTEM WENT DOWN AND WE DIDN'T GET IT. FOR SOME HOSPITALS WHICH AREN'T ON THE ELECTRONIC WEB REPORTING SYSTEM -- DELAYED THERE REPORTING FROM WHICH CRITICALLY DELAYED A RESPONSE IN CERTAIN CASES. SO AS THE WORLD MOVES FASTER AND FASTER AND WE FACE EVER MORE EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE THREATS WE NEED MORE OF A STABLE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DATA SECT SYSTEMS. AND INFORMATICS I'M URGENTLY IN CALIFORNIA AND THESE NEEDS AR ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE COMPLEX AS WE GO FORWARD. A STRONG PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE MEANS ADEQUATE EXPERT STAFFING AND RESOURCES TO ADDRESS COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN DETERMINE OUR OWN HEALTH BY INVESTING IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND STRENGTHENING OUR EXISTING SYSTEMS. SANITATION VACCINATION ELECTRONIC DISEASE IN CASE REPORTING LABORATORY CAPACITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF WHO ARE EXPERT IN RESPONDING TO ALL EMERGENCIES EVEN THE ONES WE HAVEN'T IMAGINED YET THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL QUESTIONS. OKAY. SO ACTUALLY LET ME START WITH THE DOCTOR BALTER SO YOU'RE IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HEPATITIS A YOU SAID YOU AT THE POLE PEOPLE -- YOU SAID NONESSENTIAL BUT I MY GUESS IS THAT WE SEE NONESSENTIAL NOT URGENT PRICE MORE ACCURATE -- THEN -- YOUR LA COUNTY THE BIGGEST COUNTY IN THE WHOLE STATE YOUR COUNTIES LARGER IN MANY STATES. CORRECT WE ARE LARGER THAN I THINK FORTY TWO AND AND HOW MANY CASES OF HEPATITIS A HAPPENED IN LA YOU ARE ACTUALLY ABLE WE THAT WE BELIEVE ARE RELATED TO THE OPERATOR. FIND RATE. WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP IT TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN BUT IT IT REQUIRED AN ALL OUT EFFORT BY EVERYONE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DON'T. WE'RE NOT ORDINARILY WORKING YOU KNOW TO TRACK DOWN PEOPLE IN THIS AGGRESSIVE WAY -- AND NOT REQUIRES A LOT A LOT OF PEOPLE SO SO SO I JUST. I MEAN I I GUESS I REALLY WANT TO POINT OUT SO WE HAD EIGHTEEN CASES TURN THOSE OLD ONLY EIGHTEEN CASES BUT THERE'S ONLY EIGHTEEN CASES BECAUSE YOU WORK SO HARD. RIGHT AT THAT RATE THAT MEANS THAT WE ALL RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE YEAH YOU'LL YOU'LL LEARN YOU'RE ABLE TO LEARN FROM YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT. A YOU KNOW AGAIN SAN DIEGO SANTA CRUZ WHO ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO LEARN THE LESSONS FIRST. RIGHT [inaudible] BUT EVEN LA COUNTY AS LARGE AS YOU ARE HAD TO PULL SO MANY STAFF THAT YOU COULD YOU ADD SLOWED THAT YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO GET TO OTHER THINGS SO THE ABSTAINED IT STOP IT AN IMPENDING OUTBREAK. AND THE AND SUCCESSFULLY LIMITED ONLY EIGHTEEN CASES. YEAH BUT HE DID IT HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON US AND I'D SAY CONTINUING OUT INTO THE YEAR WE HAD SHORTAGES OF LAB SUPPLIES CLINIC RIGHT WHY IS IT WAS IT. IT HAD TO BE AYE OKAY I THAT. OKAY JUST. BECAUSE I THINK LA SO BIG. YOU GOT EVERYTHING OKAY ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO YEAH OKAY -- SO [inaudible] ACTUALLY. I GOLDEN SINCERE THAT. ALSO THAT THE THANK YOU CHAIR PRESENT THE SEED I SO I YOU HEARD ME ASK FOR THE OUR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER -- ABOUT. DOING AN ASSESSMENT OF CAPACITY OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT JUST STATE THAT ALSO LOCAL IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK YOUR ORGANIZATION DE INTERESTED IN PURSUING -- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. I NEED YOUR EXPERTISE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I KNOW THE SEALY JOE AND SHE ACT OR HAVE WE HAVE. PASSED AND ASK FOR ACTUALLY SPECIFIC TO COMMUNICATE DISEASE CONTROL WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AT LEAST TO BEGIN TO FILL SOME OF THOSE GAPS PARTICULARLY WITH -- DECREASES IN REALIGNMENT ETCETERA -- WELL I THINK WE'RE WE'RE MEETING LATER I THINK THAT THAT'S IN THE WORKS FOR SURE -- BUT ALSO KIND OF DOING OUT FULL ASSESSMENT OF I THINK OFTEN THAT WE HAVE ARE VICTIMS OF LEARNED HELPLESSNESS AND SO -- THAT WE THINK WELL WE'LL GET BY BUT LOCALLY I KNOW I MEAN I I MENTIONED AT THE A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND SO IT'S WE WE WE ARE REALLY GOOD WITH. YEAH IT'S A DOCTOR SAYS THAT WE'RE REALLY GONNA GOING THROUGH BUDGET CUTS AND FIGURE IN PRIORITIZING AND SO IN SOME WAYS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WELL WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING WHAT AT WHAT ARE THE REALLY COR THINGS AND ABSOLUTELY WHAT THINK WE HAVE SOME -- GENERAL ESTIMATES OF WHAT IT WOULD COST I MEAN JUST TO GET US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE TEN YEARS AGO RIGHT AND THAT'S AN EASY. OF A RELATIVELY EASY CALCULUS BUT TO LOOK AT AS DOCTOR SMITH THE SAME WHAT ARE THE CORE THINGS THAT EVERY HEALTH DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE DOING AND WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN IN DOING THIS AS A THE CUT TOGETHER WITH THE PH. I APPRECIATE THAT THE WOULD MAKE NOTE SINCE I ALSO A MASTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH MYSELF. THAT SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE PUBLIC HEALTH WE'RE GOOD NUMBERS PEOPLE BUT SOMETIMES I THINK -- I WILL TELL YOU TIMING WISE -- BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE VERY THOROUGH AND BUT URGENCY IS ALSO THERE SO THE LONGER I EIGHT YOU WAIT TO GET US THE INFORMATION. THE LONGER IT TAKES FOR THEN THAT MEANS THAT WE CAN'T GET TO IT SO I WOULD. I HOPE I HOPE THAT -- THAT WE CAN WE CAN HEAR FROM YOU SEE -- SOONER THAN LATER SO WE CAN TRY TO HELP NOW -- ACTUALLY -- THE SERVER TO PAR YOU TALKED ABOUT NUMBERS APPEAR AS WE AYE AYE AT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF THIS OVERLAPS -- IT SEARCH CAPACITY SO -- WHICH WE DO THAT THIS IS THERE HOW IS A MENTIONED LIKE FIRE DEPARTMENTS HAVE STE NOW THEY'VE HAVE MUTUAL AID RIGHT -- IS THE DEED WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTUALLY THIS COULD BE AS FOR ANYBODY HERE -- SINCE YOU GOT YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE YOUR OWN COUNTIES -- AND AND SO. WE WE CURRENTLY HAVE SORT OF A SYSTEM -- AND BUT IS THE TO RE CREATE A MORE FORMAL SYSTEM SHOULD WE DO MORE OF MORE FORMAL SUSPEND AND TERMS OF NEW. PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND EPIDEMIOLOGISTS YOU KNOW AND SITTING AROUND IN THE WAR ROOM JUST WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING HAPPENING BY THE WEIGHT BUT AS YOU KNOW -- BUT BUT BASICALLY SAYING LOOK MAYBE THE WAY WE SHOULD APPROACH THIS IS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA CAPACITY THAT IS FUNDED TO SPREAD AROUND DIFFERENT PLACES THERE'S CERTAINLY PLENTY OF WORK TO DO BUT THEN -- INTO IT AND EVENTS -- WE'RE NOT SO THE THE DEPEND NOW PULLING PEOPLE OFF FROM THERE -- LESS URGENT ACTIVITIES AS MUCH THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CAN HELP OUT WITH ON GOING ACTIVITIES BUT THEN -- WOULD BE MORE AVAILABLE -- AND NOT HAVE TO STRESS THAT EXISTING ACTIVITIES SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT. ABSOLUTELY I THINK ALL OF YOU OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT SO SO IF YOU EXPLAINED IT EXACTLY RIGHT BUT WE REALLY NEED IS TO BUILD CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL. LEVEL TO TO DO A VARIETY OF THINGS AND IF WORD SUCCESS WITH OUR IMMUNIZATION EFFORTS AN STD CONTROL IN GENERAL DISEASE CONTROL THOSE STAFF CAN BE REDIRECTED DURING AN EMERGENCY. AND WE'LL HAVE MORE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DO THOSE ESSENTIAL SERVICES WHILE RESPONDING TO THE SEARCH THAT'S NEEDED. IN TERMS OF THE OFFICIAL SYSTEM -- IS SIMILAR TO FIRE SO FOR HOW WE REQUEST RESOURCES FROM OTHER TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS -- SO THAT THE SYSTEM IS THERE TO MAKE THOSE REQUESTS LARGER JURISDICTIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME RESOURCES THAT I CAN SPEAK FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY WE'VE WE TRY. TO PROVIDE RESOURCES WHENEVER WE CAN TO HELP OUR PARTNERS BECAUSE THEN HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE THERE FOR US WHEN WE NEED THEM -- AT AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR AMMO USED TO BE IN PLACE FOR EXAMPLE IN -- REGION SIX WERE RIVERSIDE IS SO RIVERSIDE SALMON DINO INYO MONO SAN DIEGO -- AN IMPERIAL COUNTIES WE'VE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO SHARE STAFF AND RESOURCES DURING AN EMERGENCY AND SO WE'VE ALREADY OUTLINED THE TERMS OF REIMBURSEMENT AND AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO SO I THINK THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SHARING RESOURCES IS THERE -- IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HAVING THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO SHARE AND THERE'S QUITE A DISPARITY BEING ABLE TO DO THAT BUT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THE STATE WILL PAY FOR SOME FIRE TRUCKS THAT COULD BE USED STRAIGHT AND THINGS LIKE SO WE WENT WITH THINK ABOUT. THIS WE TRIED OF ALL OF THAT -- HOW DO SAID DISAGREEMENTS ALSO WHERE SOME THE THINGS THAT SAMPLE YOU'LL SHOULD STATE PIGEON SOME RESOURCES RIGHT -- THAT THAT THAT THAT BE AVAILABLE -- DOCTOR MILLER MY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR AND YOUR TEAMS REALLY HARD WORK AND AND AND AND AND THEN THAT ACTUALLY. FORTY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IS IS THAT YOUR SUCCESS IS MEASURED BY THINGS THAT DON'T HAPPEN. RIGHT AND THAT THAT DOESN'T TEND TO MAKE THE NEWS AS MUCH -- BUT MAYBE IT'S OKAY. TO ANSWER AND UP YOU TELL ME LIKE HOUSE OF BUTTE COUNTY HOW HOW BIG WAS YOUR DEPARTMENT BEFORE. THE FIRES CAME HOW WOULD YOU START WITH THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE TOTAL -- AND THAT INCLUDES EVERYBODY THERE ARE PEOPLE DOING ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO THAT'S THAT'S THE SIZE. AND YOU KNOW WE WE GHOST UP THROUGH THE HIERARCHY THAT WAS JUST DESCRIBED AND ASK WITHIN OUR REGION I YOU KNOW EITHER FORTUNATELY UNFORTUNATELY FOR US WE'RE IN A PRETTY RURAL AREA SO THERE AREN'T MANY RESOURCES WE TEND TO BE. THE THE COUNTY IN THE AREA THAT SO WITHIN OUR REGION YOU KNOW WE NEED TO FOLLOW THAT HIERARCHY WHICH WE DO -- WE DID RECEIVE. HELP FROM FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA -- THERE WE RECEIVED FOR FOLKS FROM FROM ALL OVER AND STILL IT WAS DIFFICULT AND AND I'LL SAY THAT BECAUSE DISASTERS ARE LOCAL AND THERE'S OVERSIGHT THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE DONE LOCALLY. EVEN WITH ALL THAT HELP SOMETIMES JUST I CAN MANAGING ALL OF THAT HELP CAN BE AN ISSUE AND OF MY ANIMAL CONTROL DIRECTOR WE'RE HERE HE COULD TELL YOUR GREAT STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE COME IN AND WANT TO HELP ANIMALS. BUT REALLYMUDDYING THE WATERS SIGNIFICANTLY IN CAUSING ALMOST AS MANY PROBLEMS AS THEY HELPED TO TAKE CARE OF BUT YEAH SO FOR US REGIONALLY THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH HELP BUT BUT STATEWIDE AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE DEFINITELY SPACE. FOR MORE AGREEMENTS AHEAD OF TIME AND I THINK IN ALL HONESTY WE ALL HAVE TO FOSTER A AN ETHIC OF RESPONSE WHICH WE HAVE NOT REALLY HAD TO DO AS OF YET -- AND THAT'S AND AT EVERY LEVEL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT EVERY LEVEL AND REALIZE THAT WE ARE A PART OF THE RESPONSE BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT ETHIC IT'S EASY TO JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO YOU. AND CONTINUE YOUR DAY. AND I GUESS THE OF ONE OTHER QUESTION ACTUALLY. EACH OF YOU TO THINK ABOUT SO. WE TALK ABOUT FUNDING OR TALK ABOUT CAPACITY SO FOR A YEAR. WELL YOU'RE ALL COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS -- SO WHAT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH YOUR COUNTY DECIDES HOW MUCH RECENT HOW MANY RESOURCES YET SO -- CAN CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK SPEAK TO THAT. YES FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO THAT BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT NOW -- FOR YEAH THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- WELL. IT'S ACTUALLY STARTS CATEGORICAL OF FUNDING OFTEN WE CAN LOOK AT WILL WHAT AT THE FUNDING SOURCES THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE COMING AND WHAT HOW WE YOU KNOW PROJECT DOING PROJECTIONS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE SPENDING RIGHT NOW HOW'S THAT GOING THIS YEAR WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT FOR NEXT. YEAR AND THEN USING SOME OF THESE VERY LIMITED SOURCES OF DISCRETIONARY FUNDING TO KIND OF FILL IN THE GAPS AND RIGHT NOW I MEAN FOR PLASTER ITS IT'S NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT AND OF COUNTY GENERAL FUND MANY COUNTIES -- PUT IN YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE DON'T KNOW REALLY -- PUT A LOT OF COUNTY GENERAL FUND IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT -- I'M -- INVESTMENTS BECAUSE OF OUR WANING NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS GOING HEALTH REALIGNMENT -- HAS GONE DOWN JUST IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN THERE -- SIGNIFICANTLY AND IT'S CONTINUE TO GO DOWN SO -- SO EACH YEAR WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND ASK FOR MORE IT EITHER PULL MONEY FROM OTHER LIKE SOCIAL SERVICES REALIGNMENT FOR MORE MONEY FROM GENERAL FUND OR QUITE FRANKLY. LOOK AT AND WE JUST -- CLOSED OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LAB IN LAST YEAR -- AND HAD A CONTRACT WITH THE SURROUNDING COUNTY WE CLOSE OUR MEDICAL CLINIC SO THAT IN UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING WORLD TOO GOOD AT IS FIGURING OUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN GET MORE OFFICIAL CONTRACTING OUT. MUCH OF OUR TV WORK NOW TO THOSE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE WHERE WE'VE MADE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT FELT THAT AT THIS POINT WE'RE DOWN -- TO REALLY THE BARE BONES. IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WE ALSO ARE GOING TO THE BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT NOW -- AT AND WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY LOST COUNTY GENERAL FUND DOLLARS -- IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE LAST DECADE. NOT BECAUSE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ISN'T SUPPORTIVE OF PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE BUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE COMPETING PRIORITIES -- AND SO. WHAT HAPPENS IS THEN WERE FORCED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO FUND BECAUSE OUR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS ARE REALLY WHAT PROVIDE US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY? TO ADDRESS NEW RULES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND BUILD UP OUR CORE FUNCTIONS SO -- IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY BEEN A CHALLENGE WHERE. WE HAVE BEEN KEPT FLAT SAID NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE COUNTY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND LOOKS LIKE IT WILL STAY THAT WAY IN THE FORESEEABLEFUTURE SO IT'S REALLY A CHALLENGE. THEY ACTUALLY HOW MUCH CARE THAT'S A LAST YEAR HOW MUCH GENERAL FUND COUNTY GENERAL FUND MONEY DID YOUR DEPARTMENT GET DO YOU KNOW ABOUT -- YEAH ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF WE HAVE ABOUT A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR -- DEPARTMENTS TWO MILLION INVOICE POPULATION PLASTER COUNTY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND OKAY YOUR COUNTY SO ARE COUNTY POPULATIONS ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGETS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION AND WE GET ABOUT. ELEVEN TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND OKAY AM. DOCTOR MILLER YEAH DO I TELL ME ABOUT IT I REALIZE YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS RIGHT NOW. ACTUALLY -- DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION WHERE I CAN TELL YOU HOUSE LARGER COUNTY IS BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GENERAL FUND. MONIES ARE BROUGHT INTO THE DEPARTMENT. I DID IT OUT OF YOU KNOW FOR LA THESE ARE NOT YET THE DIRECTOR BUT I WILL SAY WE'RE GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS NOW AND IT HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR TO US THAT IN THE PAST APPARENTLY THERE WAS. MORE MONEY BUT AS YOU KNOW AS TIME HAS GONE ON THE COST OF LIVING IN LA IT'S SKYROCKETED THE STAFF. YOU KNOW SALARIES WHO HAD TO INCREASED COMMENSURATELY BUT THE FUNDING HASN'T INCREASED EITHER FROM. THE COUNTY OR THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO A LOT OF OUR FUNDING COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT DOES IMPACT I MEAN THE DIRECTORS BEEN CLEAR SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR STAFF IS LESS. THANK YOU I QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BUT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR TESTIFYING AND REALLY PRE ACTUALLY NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO. SECTION OF OUR PANEL UNDER TREATED DISEASES. AND WE HAVE -- FOR THIS PANEL [inaudible] NICHOLAS OF WE HAVE A DOCTOR -- LAURA DALTON AS CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD MAYOR MANTE HIS GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF S. T. D.'S HARRIS TI'S. WE ARE SEVENTIES AND HE SAID DAVIS -- DOCTOR NEED TO DAVIS -- THE HEALTH OFFICER FOR CITY OF LONG BEACH IS ALSO THE ADDRESS. THE ISSUE OF AS THE EYES AS WELL SO WE SERVE A AT PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. QUESTION ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE DOCTOR LOUISE MAGNET COUNTRY COST -- COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT AND DEPUTY HEALTH OPTIONS ARE ABOUT TO BURKE ELEUSIS. KAMALA KANNAN THIS FROM THE CURRENT PUBLIC COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. DEPARTMENT ASSISTED DIVISION DIRECTOR OF HEALTH SERVICES TALKING OF VALLEY FEVER AND ALSO HAVE MENACE MONTEREY COUNTY HEALTH DIRECTOR TO ADDRESS OF A CHRONIC DISEASE. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING CRIED DISEASE SO WELCOME EACH OF YOU AND THAT WILL GO HEAD START WITH DOCTOR DALTON. THANK YOU WELCOME. DOCTOR PAN AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR LAURA DALTON I AM THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD MORE MANTE THE LARGEST PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY. I AM THE CHAIR OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS FOR THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA OR P. PACK AND SERVE AS A CLINICAL VOICE FOR STATEWIDE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS ARE STI WORKGROUP. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE RATE OF CHLAMYDIA AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCREASED 9% FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND WAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE REPORTING BEGAN IN. NINETEEN NINETY THE CALIFORNIA RATES OF GONORRHEA INCREASE 16% FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND WAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA RATES OF SYPHILIS INCREASED BY OVER 21% COMPARED TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THIS IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE RATE OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS INCREASE FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR. CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IS SUPPOSE THAT IS TRANSMITTED FROM A PREGNANT INDIVIDUAL TO A FETUS AND SUBSEQUENTLY ANYMORE NEWBORN BABY. AND IT IS 1100% PREVENTABLE. CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CAN CAUSE SEVERE ILLNESS AND BABIES INCLUDING PREMATURE BIRTH. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. BIRTH DEFECTS BLINDNESS AND HEARING LOSS. IT CAN ALSO LEAD TO STILLBIRTH AN INFANT DEATH. THERE WERE THIRTY STILLBIRTH IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THREE TIMES THE NUMBER IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DELIVERED A BABY WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS DID NOT RECEIVE PRENATAL CARE. IN RESPONSE THE CALIFORNIA PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING CIVIL SCREENING FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR PREGNANCY. WE HAD A 58% INCREASE AND TESTING. ADDITIONALLY THE CALIFORNIA PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES HAVE STARTED ENCOURAGING COMPREHENSIVE STI SCREENING FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH A POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST. COLLECTIVELY WE HAVE SEEN AN EIGHT FOLD INCREASE AND TESTING OF THESE PATIENTS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN AN ALMOST 20% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WE ARE TREATING FOR SYPHILIS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE RISE IN OPIATE USE COINCIDES WITH INCREASING RATES OF THESE S. T. EYES. PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS HAVE ESTABLISHED A LINK BETWEEN OPIOID USERS TRANSITIONING TO METHAMPHETAMINE USE AND SUBSEQUENT RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOURS. WE CAN THEORIZE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE FEARFUL TO OBTAIN HEALTH CARE INCLUDING PRENATAL CARE. DUE TO FEAR OF LOSING RIGHTS OR CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILD. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS AND THE NEED FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF STI TESTING AND TREATMENT AND EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO CREATE PILOTS INVOLVING NEW TESTING AND TO IMPROVE AND UPDATE MESSAGING AND EDUCATION FOR OUR STAFF AND OUR COMMUNITIES. TITLE TEN FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY SUPPORTS OVER ONE MILLION LOW INCOME PATIENTS IMPROVING ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING PREVENTIVE AND EDUCATION SERVICES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NEW REGULATION PROJECT MANY PROVIDERS FROM THIS PROGRAM INCLUDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THE LHASA TITLE TEN SUPPORT WILL REDUCE ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE CARE AND THAT'S EXACERBATING STI CRISIS. AS PROVIDERS WE KNOW THAT WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES AND FUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD CAN DO MORE PREVENTION AND EDUCATION WHICH WILL LEAD TO HELP YOUR OUTCOMES ACROSS THE BOARD. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY CONGENITAL SYPHILIS PREVENTION AND EDUCATION. AND TITLE TEN ARE INTERRELATED. ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES IS AMUST IF WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE STI RATES [inaudible] THANK YOU. A DAVIS -- I'M DARK THEM ANYTHING DAVIS THE HEALTH OFFICER IN AS TO THE CONTROLLER FOR THE LONG BEACH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DISCUSS THE ROLE OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT -- IN ADDRESSING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME SLIDES AND I DON'T KNOW. HOW TO MAKE THEM [inaudible] ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ASKED ME TO SPEAK -- SEE. A DOCTOR DALTON HAS ARTICULATED THE MAGNITUDE OF THE S. T. D. EPIDEMIC NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE CITY OF LONG BEACH WE HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST RATE OF CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA AND WE HAVE THE THIRD HIGHEST RATES OF SYPHILIS REPORTED IN THE STATE. SHE ALSO HAS GONE OVER OUR CONCERNS AROUND CONGENITAL SYPHILIS -- IN LONG BEACH WE'VE ALSO SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE. IN. THE NUMBER OF BABIES BORN WITH THIS PREVENTABLE TRAGIC DISEASE. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA PROVIDE THE BACKBONE OF STD PREVENTION TREATMENT AND CONTROL WE HAVE THE LEGAL MANDATE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF STDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE INSURE THE PATIENTS ARE TREATED THAT THEIR PARTNERS ARE TESTED AND THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS HAVE THE TRAINING AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE GOOD CARE. THIS IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE. PREVENTING ONE CASE OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS REQUIRES A LOT OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND WORK -- HOMELESSNESS SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS FOR MANY WOMEN WITH SYPHILIS -- JUST RECENTLY WE HAD A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO IS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND USES METHAMPHETAMINES. SHE WENT TO HER LOCAL HOSPITAL -- AND DELIVERED TWIN BE PREMATURELY. THE MOM WAS DISCHARGED TO THE STREETS -- STILL NEEDING MORE TREATMENT. SO WE'VE HAD TO SEARCH FOR HER CONTACTING THE POLICE AND HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS CHECKING DMV A MEDIC COW RECORDS AND EVEN GOING DOOR TO DOOR INTO HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS TO TRY TO LOCATOR. WE ALSO MAY NEED TO PROVIDE -- TRANSPORTATION TO GET HER TO OUR THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS TO THE CLINIC TO FINISH HER TREATMENT. WE WILL NEED TO INTERVIEW HER TO FIND OUT TO OUR PARTNERS ARE AND THEN TRY TO TRACK THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY CAN -- AND TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO AN STD AND AND COORDINATE GETTING THEM TESTED. AND THEN WILL NEED TO OFF ALSO OFFER SUPPORT TO HER FOR HER SUBSTANCE USE AND HOMELESSNESS. HOUSING SITUATION. THE BABIES ARE STILL IN THE NICK YOU. AND COULD FACE ANY NUMBER OF DEVASTATING BIRTH DEFECTS FROM CONGENITAL SYPHILIS WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE BABIES ARE TREATED PROPERLY. AND WE'LL ALSO PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE. CASE INVESTIGATION SUCH AS THESE ARE THE GOLD STANDARD OF STD CONTROL IN THEIR VERY LABOR INTENSIVE. IN ADDITION TO CASE INVESTIGATIONS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PERFORM ANY OTHER PIVOTAL ACTIVITIES. TO COMBAT STDS. THE TSTING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE AND MANY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS HAVEN'T SEEN SYPHILIS BEFORE. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE TO COMMUNITY PROVIDERS. IF THIS PREGNANT PATIENT HAD HAD PRENATAL CARE AND SHE BEEN DIAGNOSED EARLIER THERE'S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED TO HELP GUIDE TREATMENT AND FOLLOW UP THE NEXT STEPS. SEVERAL COMMUNITY PROVIDERS ALSO DON'T CARRY THE REQUIRED MEDICATION TO TREAT SYPHILIS AND IN THAT CASE OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT STD CLINIC WILL TREAT THESE PATIENTS. IN THE MANY CALIFORNIA'S JURISDICTIONS THE DON'T HAVE STD CLINICS THIS IS NOT EVEN AN OPTION. WE'VE HAD TO DO ALL. WE'VE HAD TO DO ALL OF THIS WITH VERY LITTLE STAFF AND WE'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME HARD CHOICES. FEDERAL FUNDING FOR STD CONTROL EFFORTS DECREASED BY TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THIS IS A QUITE TO A 40% REDUCTION IN PURCHASING POWER WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. SO WHILE THE RATES OF STDS ARE AT ALL TIME HIGHS THE FUNDING IS AT ALL TIME LOWS. IN LONG BEACH ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES IN THE STATE WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING FOR ONE PERSON DEDICATED TO S. T. D. INVESTIGATION. BECAUSE OF THIS AND LONG BEACH AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION AND RESOURCES ON PREVENTING CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH. INVESTIGATING SYPHILIS CASES IN HETEROSEXUAL MEN AND MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN HAS SUFFERED. AND INVESTIGATING CHLAMYDIA AND MOST GONORRHEA CASES IS IMPOSSIBLE. WE'VE HAD TO REDIRECT STAFF FROM OTHER PROGRAMS JUST TO STAY BARELY AHEAD OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STD CASES NOT REALLY MAKING A DENT IN THE OVERALL LEVEL OF DISEASE. GETTING AHEAD OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE AND STDS IS POSSIBLE. IT WILL REQUIRE SUSTAINED FUNDING GOING TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO STAFF TRAIN AND RETAIN A DEDICATED AND EXPERIENCED WORKFORCE. WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE CAN STOP BABIES FROM BEING BORN WITH DEVASTATING BIRTH DEFECTS AND WE CAN TURN THE TIDE AGAINST STDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL THANK YOU SO MUCH ADEQUATE DID OKAY [inaudible] HI [inaudible] THIS WORKING [inaudible] BUT ON CUT NO -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN PAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME AND TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS LOUISE MAGNET I AM NOT CAMINO COOL DISEASE AND TRIBULUS CONTROLLER FOR CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT TUBERCULOSIS TODAY. SO TUBERCULOSIS IS THE NUMBER ONE INFECTIOUS DISEASE KILLER IT WORLD WIDE AND IT CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE U. S. -- ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OVER 20% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER F PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH TV IN THE ENTIRE US WERE CALIFORNIANS. THESE TWO THOUSAND FIFTY SEVEN RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE OUT NUMBER THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH TB IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS COMBINED. THE TWO STATES WITH THE SECOND AND THIRD HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES. TPS SKEWS ME TV IS A DISEASE THAT IS PASSED FROM PERSON TO PERSON THROUGH THE AIR. SO IF SOMEONE IS SICK WITH TUBERCULOSIS IN THEIR LUNGS WHEN THEY COUGH TALK LAUGHS SAYING THEY RELEASE TB BACTERIA IN THE AIR AND THE PEOPLE. WHO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM AND CLOSE THIRTY BACTERIA INTO THEIR BODY -- MOST PEOPLE WHO BREATHE IN THE BACTERIA WILL NOT GET -- SICK RIGHT AWAY BUT SOME PEOPLE WILL GET A LEAD IN FORM OF THE INFECTION THAT WE CALLED. THE IN TB INFECTION AND PEOPLE CAN HARPER. TB INFECTION FOR YEARS TO DECADES -- AND THEN WILL BECOME SICK LATER ON AND AND THEIR LIVES -- MOST PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH TV AND CALIFORNIA ARE MEMBERS OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS -- IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE OF COLOR. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM ALCOHOL AND DRUG OR DRUG ABUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED OR LIVING WITH HIV AIDS. OFTEN FOR PEOPLE IN THESE SITUATIONS TB IS NOT THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM. SINCE OFTEN HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT KEEPING A JOB WELL HAVING TO TAKE TIME OFF TIME OFF TO THEIR DUE TO THEIR ILLNESS. CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES CONCERNED ABOUT HOW HAVING TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE SERVICES MIGHT AFFECT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. CONCERNS ABOUT HIGHS HOUSING TRANSPORTATION CHILD CARE OR EVEN JUST FEEDING THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. ALL THIS IN THE FACE OF HAVING AN ELSE ILLNESS THAT OFTEN REQUIRES BEING ISOLATED IN THE HOSPITAL OR AT HOME FOR WEEKS TO MONTHS. TAKING MULTIPLE MEDICATIONS WHICH MAY CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS WHO SERIOUSNESS CAN RANGE FROM MILD. TO DEADLY. TAKING THESE MEDICATIONS DAILY FOR AT LEAST SIX TO NINE MONTHS ALONG WITH REGULAR VISITS THE DOCTOR FOR EXAMS. LAB TESTS AND TESTS X. RAYS HOW MANY OF US HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CLIP COMPLETED A USUAL COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS AT LAST SEVEN TO TEN DAYS. LET ALONE SIX TO NINE MONTHS -- OF MORE INTENSIVE TREATMENT. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TV CONTROL REQUIRE SUSTAINED AND PERSISTENT EFFORT. TB CONTROL PROGRAM STAFF AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MONITOR TREATMENT OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON DIAGNOSED WITH TB IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. ENSURING THAT PATIENTS TAKE EVERY DOSE OF THEIR TV MEDICATION EVERY DAY FOR THE SIX MIND. SIX TO NINE MONTHS IT TAKES TO COMPLETE TREATMENT. ENSURE THAT PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE AND THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT TO THE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS. THAT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT PREVENT THEM FROM COMPLETING TREATMENT AS ADDRESSED SOMETIMES THIS MEANS HELPING THEM FIND TRANSPORTATION. HOUSING CHILD CARE A JOB TO HEALTH SERVICES. EVEN IN ONE INSTANCE THAT I KNOW OF PROVIDING A TEMPORARY HOME FOR PATIENTS PAT. TV PROGRAM STAFF ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLETING A CONTACT INVESTIGATION FOR EVERY PATIENT WHO MIGHT BE INFECTIOUS. THIS INVOLVES IDENTIFYING ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE PATIENT WITH TB AND ENSURING THAT THEY GET APPROPRIATE EVALUATION AND TREATMENT AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY TV PROGRAM PROVIDEDCARE TO SIXTY SEVEN PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE TB. THIS IS CONSIDERED A MODERATE NUMBER OF CASES BY CALIFORNIA STANDARDS BUT COMPELS IN COMPARISON. TO JURISDICTIONS LIKE LA THAT HAVE FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED CASES. AND OTHER COUNTIES IN THE BAY AREA SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO ALAMEDA AND SANTA CLARA THAT HAVE ONE TO TWO HUNDRED CASES PER YEAR. PROVIDING CARE TO THE SIX SIXTY SEVEN RESIDENTS ARE COUNTY TO ENSURE THEY COMPLETED TREATMENT AND THAT TB TRANSMISSION WAS STOPPED. REQUIRED NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR HOME VISITS TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. MONITORING OF THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIX SIXTY FIVE AND JUSTIN'S OF TV MEDICATIONS. AND ENSURING THAT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE PEOPLE WITH POSSIBLE TV EXPOSURE WERE TESTED FOR TB AND TECH INFECTION AND TREATED APPROPRIATELY. IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH TV CONTROL PROGRAMS ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR US CITIZENSHIP COMPLETE THE REQUIRED TO BE MEDICAL EVALUATION. DUE TO CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT OCCURRED LAST FALL THIS GROUP HAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE NEW CAT CLASSES OF IMMIGRANTS. PRELIMINARY DATA FROM MY COUNTY SHOWS THAT THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS ENTERING OUR COUNTY NEEDING PUBLIC HEALTH FOLLOW UP ONE CREASE BY 3250% IN THE COMING YEAR. RESULTING IN ONE TO TWO REFERRALS TO OUR PROGRAM EACH DAY. WHAT ARE PROGRAM NEEDS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TB PREVENTION EFFORTS IN OUR COMMUNITY IS MORE STAFF? MORE STAFF TO REACH OUT TO PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO EDUCATE THEM ON HOW TO APPROPRIATELY EVALUATE AND TREAT PATIENTS WITH TB INFECTION BEFORE THEY GET SICK WITH ACTIVE. ACTIVE DISEASE. MORE STAFF TO ACT AS DISEASE DETECTIVES TO FIND PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO TB AND GET THEM INTO TREATMENT? AND MORE STEP TO FOLLOW UP WITH IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE MOST AT RISK OF BECOMING SICK WITH TB. AS LONG AS TV CONTINUES TO BE A THREAT GLOBALLY LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE THESE TIME INTENSIVE ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO PREVENT TB TRANSMISSION AND OUR COMMUNITIES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THIS HERNANDEZ OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR ON ALLOWING US TO COME SPEAK BEFORE YOU MY NAME'S CAN REALLY HERNANDEZ I AM THE ASSISTANT DIVISION DIRECTOR OF HEALTH SERVICES AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN KERN COUNTY. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK JUST FOR A MOMENT ABOUT VALLEY FEVER -- MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT VALLEY FEVER IS BUT IF YOU DON'T I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF VALLEY FEVER ONE A ONE IT'S KNOWN AS CUT VIDEO TO MYCOSIS IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY -- IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR A LOT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR **** E. FOR SHORT. BUT VALLEY FEVER IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE I GUESS THAT GROWS ON OUR SOIL. WHEN THE SOIL IS TO STORE THAT FUNGAL SPORES CAN BE INHALED AND THEY CAN INFECT THE LUNGS? YOU CAN DEVELOP A FEVER A COUGH A RASH OR A VARIETY OF OTHER SYMPTOMS. IN RARE CASES THE FUNGUS CAN SPREAD OUTSIDE OF YOUR LUNGS AND IN FACT OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS INCLUDING YOUR BONES AND YOUR BRAIN. ONE MEDICATION THERE ARE MEDICATIONS TO TREAT VALLEY FEVER AND SEVERE CASES MAY REQUIRE LIFELONG TREATMENT. PEOPLE CAN AND DO DIA VALLEY FEVER EACH YEAR. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE INFECTED WITH A HIGH FEVER NEVER KNOW IT THEY WILL HAVE VERY MILD SYMPTOMS OR MAYBE NO SYMPTOMS AT ALL. BUT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE SICK ENOUGH TO GO TO THE DOCTOR AND TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH VALLEY FEVER -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SAW THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES ABOUT A FEVER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HISTORY OF VALLEY FEVER AND THE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SUGGEST. THAT THE NUMBER IS GOING TO BE AS HIGH OR EVEN HIGHER. 40% OF CALIFORNIANS DIAGNOSE OF VALUE RELIVING KERN COUNTY. IT AFFECTS MY COMMUNITY MORE THAN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY IN THE STATE BUT EFFECTS SO MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S ONE BIG TOWN WHEN IT COMES TO VALLEY FEVER AND IT THAT'S IT'S A REGIONAL DISEASE. ON THE FUNGUS IS FOUND MAINLY IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES INCLUDING MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T LIVED HERE LONG OR IF YOU'RE A MEDICAL PROVIDER WHO WASN'T TRAINED IN THIS AREA YOU MAY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISEASE MAY BE VERY LIMITED. VALUE HAS VERY COMMON SYMPTOMS YOU CAN TALK ABOUT A FEVER A COUGH SHORTNESS OF BREATH TIREDNESS. ALONE OR IN COMBINATION THAT COULD BE A MILLION DIFFERENT DISEASES. SO MANY OF US AS PATIENTS AS PEOPLE WE WAIT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR -- SOME OF US WAIT SO LONG THAT WE END UP IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR WE HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED. WE MISS ANYWHERE FROM A WEEK OF WORK TO SIX WEEKS OF WORK ON AVERAGE. AND WE AS PATIENTS CAN BE OUR OWN WORST ENEMY IN REGARDS TO THE LIKE THE ROOM. EVEN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN AREAS LIKE KERN COUNTY WERE VALLEY FEVER IS VERY COMMON AND CAN BE MISINFORMED ABOUT THE DISEASE AND ABOUT THEIR RISK. SO ALL OF US WOULD BENEFIT FROM WHERE EDUCATION. AND THEN OF COURSE ONCE WE DECIDE WERE SICK ENOUGH TO GO TO THE DOCTOR -- WE DEPEND ON OUR DOCTOR TO KNOW ABOUT VALLEY FEVER AND TO TEST. FOR A STUDY THAT WAS IN ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO -- FOUND THAT IT TOOK AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY THREE DAYS FROM THE TIME THE PATIENT FIRST THOUGHT HEALTH CARE TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH VALLEY FEVER. 60% OF PEOPLE OR PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS THAT THEY DIDN'T NEED AND WOULDN'T HELP THEIR INFECTION OF VALLEY FEVER. IN KERN COUNTY WERE ALMOST EVERY COMMUNITY IN ART EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE MILES IS A FEDERALLY DESIGNATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SHORTAGE AREA. WE GET A LOT OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS I COME FROM FAR AWAY. YOU KNOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHO WOULD WANT TO COME TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHAT THAT MEANS IS THEY OFTEN WEREN'T TRAINED ABOUT VALLEY FEVER THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS A CONCERN IN OUR COMMUNITY -- AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW THIS. IS HOW CURATORS ARE WONDERFUL WE'RE GLAD THEY'RE HERE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY -- BUT WE WISH THAT THERE WAS A MECHANISM. TO BETTER EDUCATE THEM OR ENSURE THAT THEY WERE EDUCATED ABOUT VALLEY FEVER -- IT CAN BE DIAGNOSED OR RULED. WHAT WE HOPE FOR IS THAT ALL THE PATIENTS EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY -- IS AFFORDED THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE -- IN PARTICULAR FOR DISEASE LIKE VALLEY FEVER THAT ARE JUST UNDER AN NOT WELL KNOWN -- OUTSIDE OF THE AREAS WHERE IT'S PUBLIC. I'M AS MENTIONED VALLEY FEVER IS JUST ONE OF MORE THAN EIGHTY CONDITIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND IN MOST COUNTIES INCLUDING MINE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING BY FEVER ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR DOZENS OF OTHER DISEASES. AND AS VALLEY FEARS HAVE AS LIKE YOUR CASES OF CONTINUE TO RISE. I COUNTY AFTER COUNTY HAS FOUND THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FULLY INVESTIGATE THEM. BEGINNING JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR WE AS A STATE MOVED TO A CASE DEFINITION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE -- CASE PATIENT INTERVIEWS OR TO REVIEW MEDICAL RECORDS. AND THIS DECISION WAS MADE TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND TO CREATE A UNIFORM A DEFINITION ACROSS THE STATE. BUT IN DOING SO WE KNOW THAT WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO DETAILS ABOUT A PATIENT LIKE THEIR OCCUPATION THEIR SEVERITY OF ILLNESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE HOSPITALIZED. WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT OUTBREAKS OR DETERMINE IF EXPOSURES HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY RESIDENTS. BUT COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE FELT UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE NUMBER OF CASES AND WE AS A STATE DECIDED THAT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THE NUMBER OF CASES. IN TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL. IN AN IDEAL WORLD OF PUBLIC HEALTH WOOD WE INVESTIGATE EVERYONE OF THE NEARLY THREE THOUSAND CASES OF THE LIKE THE RING KERN COUNTY. ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S STILL SO MUCH WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS DISEASE AND WHO TO FAX. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT PREDICTS A GOOD YEAR OR A BAD YEAR FOR VALLEY FEVER. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BETTER EDUCATE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY KNOW HOW THEY CAN REDUCE THEIR RISKS. AND SO THEY KNOW THEY CAN SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND THAT WHEN THEY DO SEEK MEDICAL CARE THAT THEIR PROVIDER WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM. I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S A CLUSTER OF CASES SOMEWHERE SO WE CAN DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF EXPOSURE AND TAKES STEPS TO KEEP MORE. BEING INFECTED. BUT IN OUR CURRENT SITUATION I NEED MY LIMITED STAFF LIKE ALL THE OTHER HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND INTERVENTIONS IN OTHER DISEASES. WE ALL DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE SO I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER PUBLIC HEALTH AS YOU LIKE US SEEK TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. WE ALL KNOW THAT WITHOUT HEALTH THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE THAT MATTERS. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH MISS VENICE WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ALSO HUMANNESS AND I'M THE MONTEREY COUNTY HEALTH DIRECTOR. I'M HERE TO DISCUSS CHRONIC DISEASES AND OUR CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS THE PREVALENCE OF THEM IN OUR COMMUNITIES. DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS IN EXPANDING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CHRONIC DISEASES WHICH ARE PREVENTABLE STILL ACCOUNT 475% OF DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA. ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN ARE OVERWEIGHT. 46% OF ADULTS IN OUR STATE ARE DIAGNOSED WITH PRE DIABETES. THE BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE IS DISTRIBUTED UNFAIRLY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS LOW INCOME AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND MONTEREY COUNTY 9% OF OUR ADULT POPULATION HAD DIABETES. TWENTY POINT 6% WAS OBESE AND TEN POINT THREE HAD HEART DISEASE. ALTHOUGH THE PERCENTAGE OF MONTEREY COUNTY RED EIGHTIES WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE STATE. THE RATE OF MONTEREY COUNTY RESIDENTS HOSPITALIZED WITH PREVENTABLE LONG TERM COMPLICATIONS WAS GREATER THAN THE STATE RATE. THE PERCENTAGE OF MONTEREY COUNTY ADULT LATINOS DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES IS TWO TIMES MORE COMPARED TO WHITES. AND ONE IN FOUR MONTEREY COUNTY ADULT LATINOS ARBY'S COMPARED TO SIXTEEN POINT 1% OF WHITES. LOW INCOME LATINOS EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST HEALTH INEQUITIES DUE TO A LACK OF ACCESS TO STABLE HOUSING. HEALTHY FOODS OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTIVE LIVING SAFE COMMUNITIES AND PRIMARY CARE MONTEREY COUNTY HAS A HIGH NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WHO LACK ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE MANDATED TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES WE UTILIZE DATA TO INFORM US OF THE HEALTH STATUS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND BEST PRACTICES AND EVIDENCE BASED DREADED USED TO HELP US ADVANCE HEALTHEQUITY TO CREATE HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CAN SUCCEED OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ARE INFORMING THE WORK AND OF PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ARE FORMED. I WILL HIGHLIGHT JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES FROM MY COMMUNITY. OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT THROUGH OUR NUTRITION EDUCATION OF THE CITY PREVENTION PROGRAM HAS PARTNERED WITH WAKE AND EVERYONE'S HARVEST TO FACILITATE THE ISSUANCE OF VOUCHERS. FOR FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT FARMERS MARKETS LOCATED ARE WHAT CLINICS AND WE PARTNER WITH SCHOOLS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING AN ACTIVE LIVING. OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY OF MONTEREY COUNTY SECURED FUNDING FOR CREATING SAFE STREETS AND WALKABLE ENVIRONMENTS. INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAMMING SUCH AS WALKING SCHOOL BUSES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. COMMUNITY WIDE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EVENTS SUCH AS OPEN STREETS AND BIKE RODEOS HAVE BEEN HELD. SOME OF OUR HOME VISITATION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC DISEASES. AND WE'RE IMPLEMENTING EARLY SCREENING FOR JUST A TIONAL DIABETES TO HELP PREVENT OR MITIGATE CONSEQUENCES. THE ABSENCE OF FLEXIBLE SUSTAINABLE REVENUE AND CATEGORICAL GRANT FUNDING LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION STRATEGIES. MOST GRANTS REQUIRE SPECIFIC STRATEGIES TO BE IMPLEMENTED PREVENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FROM SELECTING STRATEGIES THAT MAY WORK ACROSS MULTIPLE CHRONIC DISEASES AN INJURY AREAS. THE SILOS ARE WORK IN ADDRESSING COMMON RISK FACTORS AND INDIVIDUALS AND ACROSS POPULATIONS. COMMUNITY MEMBERS OFTEN HAVE MORE THAN ONE RISK FACTOR AND FRAGMENTED APPROACHES ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT THE LEADING CAUSES OF CHRONIC DISEASES. ARE TOBACCO USE POOR NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL AND ACTIVITY. PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING MAY ONLY BE TOBACCO. ACCESSING USE. LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO COMPREHENSIVELY PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASES FURTHER WITH THE LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS AND LACK OF FUNDING TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS. CANNABIS PREVENTION SURVEILLANCE EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AND THE INABILITY TO USE PROP FIFTY FIFTH PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE SUBSTANCE. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE CHALLENGED IN IMPLEMENTING TRACK STRATEGIES TO REDUCE ACCESS AN EARLY INITIATION BY OUR YOUTH. WITH LIMITED RESOURCES BOTH AND DOLLARS AND STAFFING OTHER LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT MANDATE SUCH AS DISEASE OUTBREAKS TAKE PRESIDENT PRECEDENCE. AND SHIFT THE ATTENTION AWAY FROM UPSTREAM APPROACHES PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ARE BE DIRECTED AS YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER FROM THEIR DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONS. AND AN M. C. H. WHOLE PERSON CARE CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION. TO ADDRESS THESE DISEASE OUTBREAKS AT MONTEREY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE HAVE ABOUT TEN NURSES DEDICATED TO THESE PREVENTION EFFORTS AND WITH OUR RECENT OUTBREAK OF HEPATITIS SAY. THE THE STAFF MEMBERS WERE BE DIRECTED TO CONDUCT EDUCATION A VACCINATION SERVICES FOR AS MANY HOMELESS RESIDENTS AS WE COULD AND WE WERE ABLE TO VACCINATE ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. THUS KEEPING OUR OUTBREAK TO A TOTAL OF ELEVEN PREVENTION EFFORTS PARTICULAR THOSE FOCUSED ON POLICY SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT CHANGE. DON'T RESULT IN INSTANT SUCCESS BUT CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES COMMUNITIES NEED TO THRIVE ACROSS GENERATIONS FOR EXAMPLE. INJURIES RESULTING FROM VEHICLE CRASHES DID NOT DECREASE UNTIL LAWS MANDATING RESTRAINTS WERE PASSED SIMILARLY CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED A HUGE DECREASE IN TOBACCO USE AND EXPOSURE. BUT IT HAS TAKEN TWENTY PLUS YEARS TO GET WHERE WE ARE THESE EFFORTS CAN'T BE SCORED AS QUICK SAVINGS. SHOULD YOU WISH TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASES CONSIDERATION OF THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE GIVEN. SUSTAINABLE FLEXIBLE FINDING DEDICATED TO AGGRESSIVE ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES WILL ALLOW LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO TAILOR STRATEGIES TO MEET THEIR UNIQUE LOCAL NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE AN ONGOING ALLOCATION OF GFC COMMITMENT OR ESTABLISHMENT OF A WHILE THE STRESS WILL PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED TO BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES. SUPPORT FOR ADVANCING HEALTH ADVANCING HEALTHEQUITY THROUGH A FOCUS ON HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES RIGHT MARK. OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT INVOLVEMENT THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF GENERAL PLAN HEALTH ELEMENTS ADOPTION OF MULTI UNIT HOUSING SMOKE FREE TOBACCO FREE POLICIES AND TOBACCO RETAILER LE LET ME TELL LICENSE IN. I'M MORE INTENTIONAL FOCUS ON ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SUCH AS EXPAND IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SUPPORT AND EXPANSION OF NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP. AND OF COURSE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE INVESTIGATE. SO THAT WE HAVE THE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE NOT TO ONLY MEET DAY TO DAY NEEDS BUT IF WE WERE TO HAVE A BIG OUTBREAK. AND LASTLY AND THE KNOWLEDGE A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT INVESTING IN PREVENTION IS CRITICAL AND HELPS TO AVOID HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE FUTURE. INVESTING AND HELP YOUR COMMUNITIES IS THE SMARTEST WAY TO FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPED THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA. THE BENEFITS OF INVESTING IN BUILDING HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES CAN PREVENT ILLNESS INJURY AND AN EQUITABLE HEALTH CONDITIONS AND FAR OUTWEIGHED THE BENEFITS OF ACCESSING HEALTH CARE SERVICES ALONE. INVESTING TEN DOLLARS PER PERSON AND PREVENTION WITH TOTAL ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S LESS THAN ONE ONE THOUSANDTH OF WHAT WE SPEND ON HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA ANNUALLY. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR YOUR INTEREST IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL QUESTIONS A CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF. FOR THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING IN. PREVENTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOR THOSE ON THE PANL ON THE OTHER PANELS THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK EVERY DAY HIM FOR BEING HERE TODAY. ONE OFFER A SPECIAL WELCOME TO OUR MONTEREY COUNTY. COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER. MISSY MENACE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THE COMMON THREAD AMONG ALL OF THESE IS PREVENTION AND PREVENTABLE -- IN SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS I THINK ALL OF THEM. INVOLVE MORE RESOURCES MORE STAFFING. THE PROBLEM IS I SEE IT IS THAT. THERE'S NO PROFIT IN PREVENTION. AND WE HAVE A MEDICAL SYSTEM. THAT -- IS INVESTMENT. IS PLACE WHERE THERE CAN BE DERIVED PROFIT. SO LEAVES GOVERNMENT TO BE THE FIFTEEN IT -- IN THE WORK THAT YOU DO -- WITH GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN OUR LIMITED BUDGETS -- IF I MIGHT MISS HIM MINUTES YOUR FOCUS ON PREVENTABLE TYPE TWO DIABETES. IT AFFECTS OUR ENTIRE STATE. THE TRANS KEEP GOING UP IF WE HAD A BETTER WAY OF INVESTING IN PREVENTION. WE WOULD SAVE OURSELVES WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC NOT BY POLITICIANS THAT BYE. BY DOCTORS AND MEDICAL SCIENTISTS. SO -- MISSY MENACING YOUR WORK IN MONTEREY COUNTY -- IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THE AREAS OF FOCUS ON TERMS OF NUTRITION. EXERCISE LIFESTYLE -- THE RAW SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES IN BEING ONE OF THE LEADING SOURCES OF INCREASED. BAD CALORIC INTAKE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT EVERY YEAR IN ADVERTISING. IN TARGETING THE AT RISK COMMUNITIES THAT YOU DESCRIBED. WHAT IS MARIN COUNTY DOING IN WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS TO TRY? TO OFFSET THAT IMBALANCE. SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT I MENTIONED IS -- INCLUDE HAVING SOME OF OUR STAFF GOING TO THE SCHOOL SETTINGS AND OTHER SETTINGS TO EDUCATE CHILDREN AT AN EARLY AGE ABOUT. MAKING THE HEALTHIER CHOICE I WE'VE DONE SOME WORK AS WELL WITH OUR HIGH SCHOOLS TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW THAT. WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SODA VENDING MACHINES AND WE WORK WITH THEM TO GET THOSE OUT OF THEIR SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT WATER FOUNTAINS ARE IN WORKING CONDITION AND ATTRACTIVE TO KIDS -- IT'S WE'VE IMPLEMENTED RETHINK YOUR DRINK CAMPAIGN AGAIN FOCUSING ON KIDS HOPEFULLY SELECTING OUT WATER OVER ANY OTHER BEVERAGE AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE SYSTEMS THAT THEY RESIDE AND TO HOPEFULLY HELP THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. BE MORE READILY AVAILABLE FOR THE USE START EARLY ON AND KIDS ARE FIRST EXPOSED TO ALTERNATIVES. THAT THEY TEND TO GO FOR THE APPLE VERSES THE COOKIE IT'S IT'S ONCE THEY'VE BEEN INTRODUCED AND HAVE GAINED THAT APPETITE FOR THE SUGAR. THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO TWO TERMS SO AGAIN AND TESTING EARLY ON IN TRYING TO CREATE -- THE CHILDREN THAT WE NEED SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THE HEALTHIER CHOICE. THANK YOU AGAIN. SO MUCH OF THIS PARTICULAR IN THIS SERENE OF THE SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES IT'S DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH AND WHILE WE'VE. BANNED THE SALE OF SODAS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS -- THE CAMOUFLAGE OF SUGAR LOADED DURING SENT TO ENERGY DRINKS SPORTS TEAMS THAT CENTERS HOW THEY'VE. GOTTEN AROUND -- SOME OF THOSE YOU ALSO MENTION SUCCESSES IN REDUCING. TOBACCO ADDICTION IN YET -- WE'RE SEEING A HUGE INCREASE IN THE VAPING -- HOW ARE YOU APPROACHING THAT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER -- I ASSUME IN COMBINATION WITH THE SCHOOLS BUT IN TALK TO SOME OF OUR SCHOOL LEADERS AROUND THE STATE -- IT'S IT'S REALLY OUT OF CONTROL. IT IS DEFINITELY A REALLY BIG PROBLEM ACROSS CALIFORNIA PROBABLY ACROSS THE STATE -- WE ARE USING WHAT WE CAN WITH RESPECT TO OUR TOBACCO LIMITED TOBACCO FUNDING. TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY SINCE I'M GOING INTO THE SCHOOLS AND EDUCATING THE TEENS ABOUT THE HARMS OF TOBACCO USE ABOUT FAITH BEING. ABOUT REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S WHAT THEIR PURCHASING MANY KIDS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEIR PURCHASE SCENE -- WE'VE HAD A FEW INSTANCE INCIDENCES WHERE. KIDS HAVE -- BEEN EXPOSED TO AND OVERDOSED ON CANNABIS AND HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. SO WE ARE WORKING IN TERMS OF DOING EDUCATION WITH THOSE WITH THE STUDENTS AND ALSO WITH THE ADMINISTRATORS AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN MOVE TOWARDS -- WORKING WITH AND I'M IMPLEMENTING SOME POLICIES. SO THAT THERE'S OF RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN BRING ON CAMPUS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT RIGHT NOW THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH. HIDE BRING IT IN. THEY'RE SELLING IT AND AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO WORK ON ON ON ON DEVELOPING A POLICY AND THEN AND FORCING IT TO ENSURE THAT THAT KIDS AREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT ON CAMPUS THANK YOU. NINE AM APPRECIATE THAT YOU MENTION THE CANNABIS ISSUE IN YOUR EARLIERTESTIMONY AND THEN AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO THE VAPING PRODUCTS BECAUSE THAT'S AN INTERSECTION. WE HAD A RECENT HEARING ASIAN OF CANNIBAL [inaudible] IN IT'S THE LEFT AFTER WE HIT CERTAIN TARGETS. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHERS. THERE'S CAN OF THE FINAL -- BUCKET IF THERE'S MONEY THERE IS FOR EDUCATION AND PREVENTION AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE BUILT IN -- REQUIRED DIRECTIONS -- ON THE SO MISTER CHAIR JUST IF I COULD MAYBE YES ONE MORE QUESTION -- THANK YOU MISS HIM IN THIS FOR YOUR WORK -- IN THE STI -- CHALLENGE AGAIN. THE COST ONCE SOMEBODY'S INFECTED YOU GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE MOTHER WITH. DRUG ADDICTION IN. GIVING BIRTH PREMATURELY TO THE TWINS. WHAT'S THIS IF YOU HAD THE MAGIC WAND HOW DO WE GET ON THE FRONT END OF BETTER -- PREVENTION OF THE THE IT'S A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE HAVE. EDUCATION BUT OFTEN WERE RETIREMENT ASSETS AT RISK COMMUNITIES. THE TRENDS ARE GOING UP WHAT ONLY. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO REVERSE THE TRENDS? OF BOTH PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS SO PROVIDERS ABOUT THE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS HOW TO TREAT THEM HOW OFTEN YOU SHOULD BE SCREENING HOW TO TAKE A BASIC SEXUAL HISTORY FOR PATIENTS -- SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND THEN I THINK THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS WELL -- A LOT OF SIX SAID DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE IN SCHOOLS SO KIND OF REINSTITUTING THAT AND BEING REALLY OPEN AND FRANK ABOUT SEXUAL PRACTICES AND HARM REDUCTION AND AND MAKING BETTER CHOICES -- AND THEN HAVING ACCESS TESTING AND TREATMENT FACILITIES IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT. A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE GETTING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS HAVE -- ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND HAVE POOR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS -- AND SO I THINK LOOKING AT THAT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT -- AND HAVING REALLY GOOD REFERRAL SYSTEMS IN PLACE WHEN YOU ARE CHALLENGED WITH THOSE THINGS WILL BE IF THERE ARE WERE READY -- TO DEAL WITH THEIR THEIR SUBSTANCE USE FOR INSTANCE HAVING SOMEWHERE RIGHT NOW THAT WE COULD -- GET THEM TO I THINK THOSE ARE THE THINGS HAVING HOUSING RIGHT NOW THAT WE COULD HELP THEM WITH I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU IN. ON THINK PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR THE ROLE YOU PLAYING IN YOUR TEAMS AROUND THE STATE -- WITH. PART OF THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT --% FOR ANY OF YOU YOU PAUL MENTIONED AT RISK POPULATIONS HAS INCLUDING IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS. IN THE GIVEN THE CURRENT ATMOSPHERE OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- IN TARGETING IMMIGRANTS HAVE YOU SEEN A DECLINE IN PEOPLE ACCESSING. PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. BUT BECAUSE OF FEAR OF AN IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCE AREN'T -- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A DECLINE IN IN ELIGIBLE. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY NOT ACCESSING HEALTHCARE SERVICES ANY OF YOU. WE'VE WE'VE SEEN -- PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMIGRATING HERE -- UP TO BECOME MEET TO BECOME PERMANENT RESIDENTS ARE WITH SCENES THEY'VE BEEN MORE HESITANT ABOUT GOING TO GET THERE FOLLOW UP TO BE EVALUATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED THAT IF THE YOU SERVICES AT MY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY. TO APPLY FOR CITIZENSHIP LATER ON SO WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN -- AND PEOPLE AND OTHER KIND OF NON STEVE HERE WITH VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF VISAS BEING RELUCTANT ACCESS HEALTH CARE -- OR BEING RELUCTANT TO APPLY FOR FOR MEDICAL BENEFITS. THANK YOU I MEAN FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH POINT OF VIEW. GERMS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE TO NOT CHECK GREEN CARDS OR IMMIGRATION STATUS SO. REGARDLESS OF ANYBODY STATUS IN. MULTI GENERATIONAL CITIZENS ARE COMMUNITIES ENJOY BETTER HEALTH WHEN? EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAS ACCESS AND I KNOW I'M PREACHING TO THE CHOIR HERE BUT I THINK. FROM A GOVERNMENT POINT OF VIEW -- WE NEED TO TAKE CONSCIOUS STEPS TO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE FEARS AND MYTHS TO PROVIDE REASSURANCE -- FOR FAMILY MEMBERS TO TO SEEK. CARE AND TREATMENT THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM -- AGAIN I JUST APPLAUD THE WORK YOU'RE. IT'S OFTEN SAID ABOUT OUR BUDGETS THAT WERE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH WE CAN RARELY GET I SHARE THIS FRUSTRATION WITH OUR CHAIR WE WE WE COMMISERATE OFTEN THAT WHEN WE ASK. OUR FINANCE DEPARTMENT FOLKS OR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S FOLKS WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT MAKING A PARTICULAR INVESTMENT IN OUR BUDGET. AND THEY CAN RARELY TELLIS OUT YEARS HOW MUCH MORE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY IN IN ITS IN THIS ARENA ESPECIALLY. THAT OUR FAILURE TO INVEST ADEQUATELY. IN PREVENTION WE CAN GUARANTEE WE'RE GONNA SPEND MORE DOWN THE ROAD WITH. WITH TREATMENT BUT AGAIN I APPLAUD THE WORK YOU'RE DOING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER MONEY YES -- WHEN WE DO OUR BUDGETS -- SINCE AS A TO THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- THOUGH HE'S HAPPY TO TELL US HOW MUCH AN INTERVENTION WOULD COST THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST WITHOUT THAT INTERVENTION RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING I APPRECIATE CENTER MONEY BRINGING UP. AND ALSO LIKE SHE ACTUALLY -- JUST TO FOLLOW UP AND QUESTIONS FOR CEREMONY AND FOR DOC HURT PEOPLE BEING RELUCTANT TO SIGN UP FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES LIKE. YOU KNOW MEDI CAL OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS BUT YOUR TD CONTROL OFFICER SO YOU'RE GOING SAY YOU GOT TV AND WE'RE GOING TO COME BY YOUR HOUSE OR YOU COME TO OUR CLINIC -- SO WE CAN BE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR MEDICATION. HAVE YOU RUN INTO THAT PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE INTERFACE WITH THE WELL BUT YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT SERVICE SO I'M ANYWAY WE ARE WE HAVING PROBLEMS WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO AVOID ACTUALLY SEEN. PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE AND THEY WOULD -- AND AND THAT THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE ONLY. YEAH I'D I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN NOT SUCH OKAY AND BECAUSE WHAT WE DO ESPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE RECENTLY ARRIVING TO THE U. S. OR WHO ARE APPLYING FOR CITIZENSHIP. IS -- THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- AN EVALUATION THAT'S PRESCRIBED BY THE CDC AND SO THEY'LL SAY WELL I DON'T I DON'T. I DON'T WANT TO GO SEE A DOCTOR I DON'T WANT TO GET INSURANCE TO PAY FOR IT. SO EITHER THEY SAY YOU KNOW DO I REALLY HAVE TO DO IT OR THEY'LL TRY -- SEE IF THEY CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT -- OUT OF POCKET OKAY SO WHAT IS SO SO BASICALLY I'M JUST WRAPPING UP BECAUSE OF THE ONE IS THAT. IT BE KIND OF SCARY THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY YEAH YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING. TO PREVENT OTHER PEOPLE FROM CATCHING TB SO WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TRYING TO AVOID. THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE I MEAN WE KNOW THERE'S TO BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED THAT THE OF A PUBLIC CHARGE -- ALSO SOUNDS LIKE BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT PUBLIC CHARGE -- WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE THEM IN SOUTH DEPARTMENT ISN'T ALSO TRIED RIGHT EVERY HEALTHCARE SERVICE AVAILABLE RIGHT SO WE'RE DEPENDENT ON HEALTHY PEOPLE WILL GET COVERAGE AND BE ABLE TO GET -- BUT THEY CAN THE BASIC THAT'S AUSSIE SHIFTING MORE ACTIVITY. TO PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGETS WHERE IS MAYBE A CLINICA DE TAKING CARE OF SOME OF THIS -- SO THAT YOU YEAH -- IT'S IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY GOT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE VERSUS NOW SAYING WELL BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO TO A CLINIC BECAUSE I'M AFRAID IT'S GONNA BE PUBLIC SHARDS OF NOW. MORE CLINICAL ACTIVITIES GET SHIFTED ON TO PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE DEAD TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. YEAH WE ARE COUNTY IS A LITTLE BIT. UNIQUE IN THAT WE WELL WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A A WE DON'T HAVE A TV CLINIC THAT'S ON BY PUBLIC HEALTH -- BUT I COULD DEFINITELY SEE AND COUNTIES WHERE YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR PROVIDER YOU GO TO PUBLIC HEALTH I COULD DEFINITELY SEE THAT HAPPEN OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AND ACTUALLY -- SPENT AS AN IT ANSWER FIVE AND CENTER MONEY YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED 46% HAVE PRE DIABETES SO -- SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE EVENTUALLY BECOME DIABETIC. MAYBE I CAN ASK MY HEALTH OFFICE OKAY **** ALL RIGHT I THINK IT'S ONE IN FOUR I I KNOW TO ASK YOU THE QUESTION I KNOW THE ANSWER. TO SO SO SO SO THAT'S THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE RIGHT AND WE KNOW THERE'S INTERVENTIONS LIKE THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE THEM SEE -- DIETITIANS -- THAT CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THAT BY ABOUT HALF -- SO EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT AGAIN AND-AND THE OTHER I THINK I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU SAID IS IS THAT WHEN IT COMES. TO CHRONIC DISEASES LIKE OKAY CHRONIC DISEASES -- MAN THAT NOT AS URGENT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN I SAY NOT ESSENTIAL IS IT NOT AS URGENT AS PERHAPS AN OUTBREAK GOING ON AND SO WE I HEARD THAT VENTURE NURSES -- OF THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK WE HEARD FROM THE LA. I COUNTY AS WELL THAT HAPPENED -- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE CHRONIC CONDITIONS STOP WENT AWAY IT JUST MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING HELP AND I WOULD POINT OUT WE HAD A PREVIOUS HEARING WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT 40% OF CALIFORNIANS AT LEAST ONE CRY CONDITION THAT CARE COSTS. RIGHT SO WE'RE SPENDING WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE'RE SPENDING 70%. 7280% ON A HEALTHCARE SPENDING ON THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NOT DOING THE PREVENTION RIGHT RIGHT SO -- WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT BUDGETS AND TALKING ABOUT THINGS WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T DO THINGS -- AND IT WOULD IT HELP IF I MAY IT'S GOING TO TAKE INVESTMENT ON BOTH ENDS RIGHT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC CONDITIONS NOW THAT WE STILL HAVE TO CARE. FOR SO WE STILL HAVE TO KEEP INVESTING IN THAT LINE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN THE PREVENTION MORE HEAVILY SO THAT HOPEFULLY. YEARS FROM NOW. IT'S MORE BALANCED AND WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE. TO IT LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY PROMOTE WELL BEING AND THAT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO WALK FROM HOME TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN A SAFE COMMUNITY AND AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INVEST HEAVILY ON THAT PREVENTION SIDE IF I OR ELSE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THE HIGH. RATES OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW [inaudible] S. CI [inaudible] SURPLUS. I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT WHEN WE WITH THE VICTORIAN ERA. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A MULTI DRUG RESISTANT GONORRHEA. BY THE WAY YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE THE SURPLUS YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TO TRACK ON A RE ANYMORE. THEY REALLY DO SURPLUS. AND I WILL SAY YES TO ANSWER ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK BEFORE -- THAT STD CONTROL BRANCH I BELIEVE -- WAS THE LEAD BUT THEY'VE DONE AROUND STD -- WORK FOR SO I CAN'T TELL YOU. FOR THE CITY OF LONG BEACH WE SHOULD HAVE FIVE DISEASE INVESTIGATORS -- AND WE NEED ANOTHER DOCTOR AND WE NEED A SUPERVISOR DATA ANALYST SO AND YOU HAVE THAT. OKAY. SO THE LADY AT THE END AND AND I KNOW ES DE ACTUALLY. WE HAVE ONE WE HAVE ACTUALLY ONE PROVIDER PLANNED PARENTHOOD YEARLY OF PERCEIVED PUBLIC HEALTH BUT REALLY I MEAN IT IS THIS INTERFACE TO WRITE AS I LAY ASK IF ANY PLANNED PARENTHOOD WE HAVE. WE HAVE THE NEW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO CUT OUT CUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD BY THE KNEES. I CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'RE IN THE STATE WILL WE WON'T ALLOW THEM TO HAVE TO CLOSE ALL THE CLINICS BUT IF. THAT CAPACITY ONE AWAY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT. TO YOUR HEATH DEPARTMENT IF SUDDENLY ALL THE ALL THE CAPACITY OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD SAID WHAT SORRY WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE THAT WE'RE WE'RE SHUTTING THAT OFF. WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN -- FOR LONG BEACH OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD IFTHEY SEE ON MANY OF THE PATIENTS AND THEN -- IF THEY'RE POSITIVE AND THEY GET SENT TO THE HOME. SO I THINK THEY WOULD JUST COME DIRECTLY TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROBABLY -- I OFFEND PEOPLE FOR THAT RIGHT IT WOULD BE. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT I I THINK WE ALL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE ABLE TO HAVE AN ISSUE THE CLINIC IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND -- BUT IT IS I THINK YOU KNOW KIND OF A CORNERSTONE OF STD CONTROL -- TO BE ABLE TO GET PATIENTS IN WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO SO ANY FUNDING CUT OF ANY SORT WHETHER ITS TITLE -- TEN MEDICARE HOW WHICH IS ANOTHER BIG UNDER -- IS IS -- MAKING -- ALREADY KINDA TENUOUS SITUATION KIND OF FALL OFF THE CLIFF AND WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT WHAT'S DRIVING THE STI. A BREAK RIGHT. IT'S IT'S NOT JUST THAT -- SO AND I ACTUALLY WORKED IN A CLINIC WHERE THEY DID THEY THEY WERE THE ESSENTIALLY THE STI ARM FOR THE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT WASN'T HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT -- WELL IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT OKAY WELL WE DIAGNOSE YOU AN STI HERE'S THE TREATMENT NEAR THE ANTIBIOTIC AND TELL US WHO YOU CONTACTS ARE WE'VE GO AND TRY TO FIND THEM AND STUCK THEM AS WELL. WHAT'S DRIVING IT OR THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW -- SUBSTANCE USE POVERTY. OTHER TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND SO FORTH AND OUR TO RATIONS ARE SERRATION RIGHT SO ARE YOU ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL THE SERVICES IN THE AT THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. NO WE'RE NOT SO WE'RE ONE OF THE CITY HEALTH DEPRIVE CITY HOW THE PRICE IT'S A YEAH YOU'RE CITY EYES ARE -- NO AND I THINK NO ONE IS ABLE -- TO BUT I THINK WE ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF WORKING AND I DON'T DEPARTMENT AS WE HAVE HOMELESS SERVICES -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE COMMUNITY HEALTH WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WE HAVE CHRONIC JOURNEYS PREVENTION AND SO WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER AND WE BRING IN THE POLICE WE BRING IN YOU KNOW. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS A HEART TEAM WHICH WORKS IN HOMES COMMUNITIES SO WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REALLY ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS AND TO TRIGGER PEOPLE AND TO TRY TO DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT THING TO GIVE THEM BREAK THAT. FIX THEIR ISSUE RIGHT SO -- DR DALTON. TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I KNOW YOU DO MUCH MORE INDUSTRY STI IS SO CAN YOU TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT PERHAPS THE ROLE OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTUALLY COMPLAIN IN TERMS OF THESE THE THE THE THE THINGS DRIVING STI SO ASIDE FROM JUST. TREATING PEOPLE AS TI IS I MEAN WHY WOULD THE L. WIRES ON THE THINGS THAT YOU DO THAT HAVE PEOPLE COME IN RELATION TO BILL THE PATIENTS AND ALSO OTHER SERVICES YOU PROVIDE REFERRALS THAT YOU PROVIDE THAT HELP ADDRESS THIS. THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY I THINK -- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO COMMENT ALSO ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION -- REGARDING -- THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO TREAT FOR SYPHILIS SO WE HAVE SEVERAL COUNTIES WITH AND KIND HEARTED MARMITE TASTES REGION. ON THAT DOES NOT BUT DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TREAT INVERSE OF US AREN'T RELY ON OUR PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE THAT -- AT TEN PART AMANTE WE OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE SERVICES SO WE TREAT NEWBORNS TWO HUNDRED PLUS. WE OFFER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THAT IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR PRIMARY CARE MODEL -- GENDER AFFIRMING CARE SERVICES PRENATAL CARE SERVICES -- AFFECTED ME SERVICES -- AND THEN REFERRALS AS NEEDED TO OUR COMMUNITY -- RESOURCES FOR HOUSING AND FOOD NEEDS. I THINK -- SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT AS ONE OF THE EXPERTS AND SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ON THE GROUND. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO COLLECT A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA -- WHEN WE ARE FACING EPIDEMICS SUCH AS THE? AND IT WAS THE INFORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND COMPARED AMANTE THAT REALLY STARTED THE WORK. OF US CHANGING -- SCREENING OF PATIENTS FOR SYPHILIS. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT MORE -- AND IF THERE IS AN OPTION FOR US TO BE MORE INNOVATIVE AND FORMALIZE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS -- BECAUSE WE SEE THE PATIENTS WE HAVE THE DATA -- AND CAN WE NEED TO KIND OF WORK MORE FORMALLY WITH OUR LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE AN IMPACT BECAUSE I THINK. IN SOME OF THESE AREAS LIKE CONGENITAL SYPHILIS -- AN EPIDEMIC WE DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT IS CAUSING IT WE CAN DERIVE ALL THESE ISSUES WITH HOMELESSNESS -- AND DRUG USE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT COLLECTING DATA TO SAY WHAT'S WHAT'S NOT WORKING WITH OUR CURRENT -- SCREENING GUIDELINES THEN USING THAT DATA SO WE GET YES -- THE STATE ACTUALLY HE HAS HAVE SOME EXPANDED SCREENING GUIDELINES THAT ARE IN DRAFT FORM SO HOPEFULLY LATER THIS YEAR THEY'LL BE ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT. SHE'S DISCUSSING -- MAKING YOU KNOW TESTING MORE PEOPLE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PREGNANCY STATUS WHEN YOUR BEING SEEN. SO I MADE A I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- IS DESERVE THIS -- THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SERVE THE REST OF THE THE SERVER THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND DIFFERENT -- THE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THAT AND SO WE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS WHAT DEGREE CAN YOU -- AND IT'S IT'S GREAT WHEN PEOPLE CIVIL VOLUNTEER AND HELP YOU STILL NEED SOMEBODY ON THE HEALTH STAFF TO COORDINATE ALL THE VOLUNTEERS VOLUNTEERS OUT COORDINATE ARE USING. NOW TO CREATE CAN BE MORE CONFUSION ANYTHING ELSE IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF DIRECTION AND BUT ALSO ON THE ONGOING PEACE RIGHT WHERE THEY WERE TALKING STI IS -- TV CRACKED DISEASE AND ACTUALLY VALLEY FEVER AS WELL. AC WE CAN AYE -- TRENT HERNANDEZ ABOUT THE VALLEY FEVER YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE CONDITION AND AND THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO BUT HE'S TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S DOING WITH THE PROVIDERS TO YOU MENTIONED MANY OF THEM. NEVER HEARD OF VALLEY FEVER LOCAL DISEASE -- AND YOU KNOW I TRAINED ON THESE BECAUSE THERE WAS A VALLEY FEVER AND IT'S FOR TRANSYLVANIA TO MEDICAL SCHOOL IN BOSTON RIGHT IN MY RESIDENCY TRAINING SO. WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE ROLE OF? OF OF THE YOU KNOW OF PUBLIC HEALTH YOUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF EDUCATING BUT ALSO A TWO TYPES OF DIRECTION YOU GIVE TO YOUR ORDER -- TO TO YOUR LOCAL. DECISIONS AND OTHER HEALTH PROVIDERS TO BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION YOU NEED ON VALLEY FEVER TO WORK WITH THEM TO BE SURE THAT THEY'RE MAKING ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS YOU'RE ABLE. TO CONTACT OUR EVER TRACE KEEP TRACK OF THIS THE PURPOSE THE TEST TAKES I KNOW WE CHANGE THE DEFINITION IT CETERA BUT THE COLLABORATIONS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED A KERN COUNTY -- WITH WITH THE PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO KEEP YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AROUND VALLEY FEVER -- IN KERN COUNTY WE WERE WE'RE LUCKY THAT MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS IT YOU KNOW DO NO VALUE FOR A WHILE AND WE HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTORS -- WHO HELP SUPPORT THIS EDUCATION -- A LOT OF AYE FEVER IS DIAGNOSED IN PRICE IN PRIMARY CARE AND SO A LOT OF IT IS -- REACHING NEW PHYSICIANS -- WE WE HAVE A DEDICATED VALLEY FEVER WEBSITE IN KERN COUNTY AND THAT SPEAKS TO THE DATA TO THE DISEASE -- OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY -- WE'RE VERY LUCKY THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY DOES CLINICAL TESTING FOR VALLEY FEVER IN THE IN MY OPINION ARE THE BEST -- LAB VALLEY FEVER -- YOU KNOW IN THE NATION BUT THEY WE WE STRUGGLE IN REACHING A LOT OF PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEIR NEW -- AND WE DO HAVE SOME SYSTEMS OF WE USED A HAND TO SEND UP PROVIDER ALERTS TO REMIND THEM ABOUT THE LIFE HERE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT PREVENTION -- BUT IT'S HARD -- WE HAVE THE LIKE YOUR INSTITUTE AT COMMERICAL AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW IT HAS RECENTLY COME INTO FRUITION THEY ACTUALLY HOLDING A SYMPOSIUM -- FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS I AM IN A REACH OUT TO OUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND YOU KNOW INCLUDING. DOCTORS TO PRACTITIONERS ANY KIND OF PROVIDER AND TO TELL ABOUT THE IF YOU WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY ASK QUESTIONS TO KIND OF CREATE THAT RESOURCE BASE SO THAT -- IF THEY NEED TO DISCUSS TREATMENTS -- THAT THEY HAVE A POSITION TO HELP THEM WITH THAT -- AND SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF A LONG TIME COMING AND WE'RE WE'RE GLAD THAT THIS IS THE RELATIONSHIP IS DEVELOPING AND SO WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO REACH THEM. AND YOU KNOW THE THE TRICKIEST PART IS THAT WE DON'T CONTROL THE PRIZE THAT COME IN -- AND IF THEY ARE IN LARGE CLINIC GROUPS USUALLY THERE'S KIND OF THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM TO HELP THEM BUT WHEN THEY COME IN AS A PRIVATE PROVIDER OPEN THEIR NEW PRACTICE -- IF THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GO OUT ONE ON ONE TO EDUCATE PROVIDERS -- WE DO A BIT OF EDUCATION AS WE ARE RECEIVE THE LABORATORY RESULTS TO KIND OF TALK THROUGH I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS WE GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS SOMETIMES ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS ABOUT A PATIENT'S DIAGNOSIS IF THEY NEED TREATMENT OR NOT -- AND USUALLY HAS TO GET REFERRED TO A MEDICAL DOCTOR -- TO HELP THEM. TALK THROUGH IT SO THERE IS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR BETTER EDUCATION -- AND AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF CLINICAL STUDIES CLINICAL TRIALS THAT ARE GOING ON AND THROUGH THAT YOUR INSTITUTE IN ORDER TO HELP PROVIDE BETTER -- CLINICAL GUIDANCE ABOUT TREATMENT AND I'M ONE OF THEM IS IMPAIR TREATMENT -- OF VALLEY FEVER YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SUSPECT MANY PEOPLE ARE MISDIAGNOSIS BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA GIVEN ANTIBIOTICS THEN THEY EVEN TAKE ONE OR TWO COURSES SOMETIMES ANTIBIOTICS BEFORE IT BACK YEARS CONSIDERED -- VERSES IF WE KID CHIEF AMONG YOU KNOW STARTING WITH THE ANTI FUNGAL SLICKLY OUR TURNAROUND TIME IN KERN COUNTY IS VERY QUICK THAT IF THEY DON'T NEED WE TAKE THAT UP TAKE IT. TAKE THEM OFF OF IT RELATIVELY QUICKLY VERSES IF THEY DO NEED IT THEY'LL BE ON IT TWO WEEKS FASTER -- THAN IF THEY HAD STARTED EMPIRICALLY OKAY. SO -- YEAH LAST YEAR WE PUT INTO THE STATE BUDGET THANKS TO CENTER FULLER -- FUNDING FOR THE VALLEY FEVER INSTITUTE BUT I WHEN THAT THE ITEM CAME TO OUR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE A I DID ASK LIKE WHAT DOES THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT NEED RIGHT AND SO HE SAID YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE. TO DO SOME ONE ON ONE EDUCATION. OKAY AS A WELL WHAT ELL ME WHAT YOU NEED. I CAN'T PROMISE YOU ANYTHING BUT YOU KNOW THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS THE CAPACITY TO TRY TO ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE AS WELL AS YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE. AND NOW MORE DOCTORS YOU CAN AT AT AT THE MEDICAL CENTER TO DO THAT AND MORE RESEARCHERS AND LENA CAME FROM ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS SO I'D LIKE RESEARCH -- BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO BE SURE THAT CITY AS WELL. I DON'T THINK IT PIECE OF THAT IF I MAY IS -- LEARNING MORE ABOUT VALLEY FEVER ITSELF YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT TALK ABOUT TREATMENT OF PATIENTS BUT WE'RE REALLY MISSING A BIG PIECE OF THE PREVENTION OF VALLEY FEVER AS A COMMUNITY -- I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW FROM OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH STANDPOINT A LOT YOU KNOW CAL OSHA HAS PUT OUT SOME GUIDANCE -- AND A LOT OF EMPLOYERS CALL OUR OFFICE AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT CAN I DO YOU KNOW TO PROTECT MY WORKERS. AND WE UNFORTUNATELY HONESTLY DON'T HAVE GOOD ANSWERS WE HAVE KIND OF COMMON SENSE ANSWERS THAT SAY IF IT'S WINDY -- THEN YOU SHOULD MOVE YOUR WORKERS INDOORS OR STOP WORK BUT THEN THEY ASK HOW INDIA'S WINDY AND WE HONESTLY DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT IF IT'S FIVE MILES AN HOUR THAT PUT YOU AT RISK OR THIRTY MILES AN HOUR. AND SO THERE'S THERE'S A NEED -- FOR A COMMUNITY TYPE OF RESEARCH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GUIDE PEOPLE BETTER -- AND THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THE BIGGER PIECE OF IT OKAY WE HOPE TO SOMEDAY BE HOPE TO GET OUT AND I I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT A THAT I TALKED CENTER GROWTH WHO WHO REPRESENTS THE AREA AND THE CHALLENGES WITHOUT THE ANSWERS WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEN YOU. HAVE TO BE VERY CONSERVATIVE RIGHT WELL IT'S WINDY WELL THERE'S ANYWAY AND WHAT LIMIT PEOPLE NEED TO WORK WE NEED TO GET THINGS DONE IT'S AT IT SO. I HAVING THAT DATA SO WE CAN BETTER TAILOR MORE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND ALSO KNOW WHAT REALLY IS AS I THINK OF IMPORTANT -- FOR FOR CERTAINLY -- AREAS AFFECTED BY VALLEY FEVER APPRECIATE THAT. BOTH HELLO THANK ALL OF YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR TESTIFYING AND FOR SHARING WITH -- THE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- YOUR YOUR INSIGHTS THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT WE'RE MOVING ON TO OUR LAST PANEL WHICH IS BUT A VERY IMPORTANT ONE SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT PROBLEMS -- WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DIFFERENT IDEAS BUT THIS IS THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS IN INVESTMENTS. SO -- WE HAVE -- TRUDY RIMANDO FROM THE SAN BIRD ITO ASSEMBLY -- COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR -- IS GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT FUND I SEE HIS FOR THAT LAKE COUNTY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH -- HIS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE AND SCA USE SEVEN TWO ONE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS -- DR -- MEGAN CRUMPLER FROM THE ARCH COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY AT DIRECTOR SCOTT TALK ABOUT LAB CAPACITY AND HAITI THAT A DOCTOR HAITI DEBRETT'S YOLO COUNTY OF THE DVL JUST. TALKING ABOUT IN INFORMATION DATA AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SO WELCOME -- WHEN WE START WITH THAT AS THE DIRECTOR ROMAN? RIMANDO WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS UP MY NAME IS TUTOR MONDO AND THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR SALMON DINO COUNTY. AND THE IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE FUNDING CHALLENGES THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE INDOOR TO DATE -- BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY CONSIDERATIONS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. AS YOU LOOK TO BOLSTER PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE FUNDING FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. WHETHER THEY BE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL THE MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS ACTUALLY COME FROM EITHER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR THROUGH NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT. A REAL SORT OF RECENTLY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION COMPARED LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING MADE AVAILABLE TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO AS FAR BACK AS EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN WE CHOSE TO USE THE200-072-0008 AS A BASS LINE BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE TIME IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE GREAT RECESSION. AND I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SOON SEE AS UP THE FUNDING FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SINCE THAT TIME HAS NEVER TRULY RECOVERED. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WERE BUDGETED TO RECEIVE ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION IN TOTAL FUNDS LESS. THAN OUR TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUDGETS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THOUGH THAT THIS NOT AMOUNT ACTUALLY INCLUDES INCREASES AND FEDERAL AND SPECIAL FUNDS SO ULTIMATELY THE NET DECREASE IS THE RESULT OF A TOTAL DECREASE OF STATE GENERAL FUNDING. IN THE AMOUNT OF NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THREE KEY AREAS OF FUNDING. AT THE FIRST IS AROUND INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL IS BUDGETED TO RECEIVE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION MORE. IN FUNDING BUT WHEN YOU EXCLUDE THE CATEGORICAL FUNDING AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT RELATED TO HIV AND AIDS. THE ACTUAL FUNDING THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL GET. WILL BE EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN WHAT THEY RECEIVED IN 200-072-0008. CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION IS BUDGETED TO RECEIVE TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION MORE. ULTIMATELY THOUGH WHEN YOU REMOVE THE DRAMATIC CURRENT INCREASES AND TOBACCO FUNDING. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL RECEIVE FIFTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN WHAT THEY RECEIVED IN 200-072-0008. AND FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE BUDGETED TO RECEIVE TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION LESS THAN WHAT THEY RECEIVED IN 200-072-0008. I THINK AS YOU HEARD OF MUCH OF THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS CATEGORICAL FUNDING -- AND ULTIMATELY IS INFLEXIBLE AND CANNOT BE SHIFTED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. SO THOUGH IN MANY INSTANCES WHAT YOU MAY SEE ARE ACTUALLY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUDGETS IN TOTAL INCREASING THAT'S THE RESULT OF CATEGORICAL FUNDING. OFTEN THE FUNDING IS ALSO SO PRESCRIPTIVE IN NATURE THAT IT DOES NOT ALLOW US TO EITHER SUPPORT OR EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM ANY OF OUR CORE FUNCTIONS. NOR DOES IT ALLOW US TO SUPPORT ANY OF OUR CORE INFRASTRUCTURE. ALTERNATIVELY HOWEVER NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT IS SEEN BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AT THAT FLEXIBLE SOURCE. AND CONSEQUENTLY ENDS UP BEING EITHER THE PRIMARY OR SOLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR US TO PERFORM MANY OF OUR CORE INFRASTRUCTURE. YET IN COMPARISON WITH ALL OF THE DRAMATIC INCREASES YOU'VE SEEN IN CATEGORICAL FUNDING. CURRENT NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT FUNDING IS OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN IT WAS IN 200-072-0008. AND LASTLY. IT CERTAINLY IN RECENT YEARS NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT FUNDING HAS SEEN A LOT OF DIVERSIONS TO HELP FUND OTHER PRIORITY AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE IN SAMBHAR DINO COUNTY WHERE I'M FROM. OUR TOTAL NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WAS ROUGHLY FIVE MILLION LESS THAN WHAT RECEIVE WHAT WE RECEIVED IN 200-072-0008. AND I KNOW OVERALL THOUGH THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A VERY LARGE NUMBER. OF THAT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS 9% OF OUR TOTAL. CONVERSELY OUR POPULATION INCREASED BY 7% DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. ULTIMATELY THE INVESTMENT OF STATE DOLLARS TOWARDS BROAD COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL HAS DRAMATICALLY DIMINISHED. WITH VERY LITTLE **** FUNDING COMING FROM THE STATE. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LIKE MINE HAVE LOOKED TO HEALTH REALIGNMENT TO HELP. BACK FILL ALL OF THOSE NEEDS. HOWEVER OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DO SO HAS BEEN STYMIED BY THE FUNDS JUST ABSOLUTE INABILITY TO RECOVER FROM THE RECESSION -- AND IS EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT DIVERSIONS OF HEALTH REALIGNMENT. AND AS OF LATE THE COMMUNICATIVE THESE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED BY OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES THAT ALSO REQUIRE RESOURCES LIKE TO HAVE A BY A BREAK IN OUR HOMELESS POPULATIONS. FINALLY AND I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T EXPRESS SOME APPRECIATION FOR THE INCREMENTAL FUNNY THAT WE'VE SEEN. AS OF LATE. AND CERTAINLY WE WILL -- BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE NEED IS FUNDING THAT IS ONGOING SUSTAINABLE. AND FLEXIBLE THE ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS OF FUNDING ULTIMATELY JUST ALLOW US TO DO ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. IT ALLOWED US TO PURCHASE A SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES AND TO DO SOME EXPANDED OUTREACH AND EDUCATION BUT AGAIN IT WAS LIMITED AND FUNDING WHAT IT DID NOT ALLOW ME TO DO WHAT HIGHER CRITICAL STAFFING THAT I NEEDED. TO SCREEN TO TEST TO INVESTIGATE AND TO TREAT THE RISING CASELOADS WHAT I SEE ON MY DESK EVERY DAY. AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T DOING ANYTHING TO HELP SUPPORT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE NOR IS IT HELPING US TO SUPPORT -- AND IT FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COULD ADEQUATELY ADDRESS. ANY OF THE EMERGENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. SO I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR EXAMINING THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY. AND HOPING HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER ONGOING A FLEXIBLE INVESTMENTS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IT'S ONLY THREE SUSTAINED ONGOING INFLEXIBLE FUNDING THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WILL BE ABLE TO REBUILD OUR LOCAL CAPACITIES. AND STRENGTHEN OUR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE THANK YOU THANK YOU -- SAUCY WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. MY NAME IS JAMAICA AUSSIE ELEMENT EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY WORKFORCE AROUND FOUR THOUSAND PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTIGATORS. ANALYSTS PROGRAM PLANNERS. HEALTH EDUCATORS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS CLINIC STAFF LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES EPIDEMIOLOGISTS LAB TECHNICIANS CASE MANAGERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WHO WORK TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE POPULATION SIZE OF OVER TEN MILLION. THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE UNITED STATES. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE THE FRONT LINES OF ANY POSSIBLE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WHETHER IT IS A NATURAL DISASTER. PANDEMIC OR INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK. AS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE I HAVE THE JOB I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF DOING. YOU SEE I'M A SECOND GENERATION PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. AND I WAS INSPIRED TO ENTER THE FIELD BY MY MOTHER FREE ALLOWED A MORE. WHO WORKED FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES? FOR AS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. AS A GIRL I WOULD HEAR STORIES OF THE EXCITING WORK SHE DID AS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE IN THE FIELD. AS ALWAYS KNEW I DIDN'T WANT TO WORK IN AN ACUTE CARE NURSE FACILITY AT THE BAD SIDE. BUT INSTEAD MY CALLING WAS TO LEAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON MY COMMUNITY AS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. IT WAS WITH THIS CALLING THAT I WORK TO GET SPECIALIZED EDUCATION AND TRAINING NEEDED TO BECOME A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. FIRST GETTING MY BACHELORS BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN NURSING AND THEN MY PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING CERTIFICATION. IN ADDITION TO MY EDUCATION I HAVE BENEFITTED TREMENDOUSLY FROM THE ADDITIONAL ON THE JOB TRAINING I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. AS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE WITH THE COUNTY I'VE HELD VARIOUS ROLES. I STARTED MY CAREER AT THE DISTRICT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR REACH AND RESPONSE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WHO TESTED POSITIVE OR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. FOLLOWING UP TO ENSURE THEY AND THEIR PARTNERS TOOK APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD TO OTHERS AND TO SUPPORT HEALTHY DELIVERY FOR THEIR MOMS AND THEIR BABIES. IN MY CURRENT ROLE. I AM PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON BUILDING OUT THE FIRST EVER COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM PROGRAM AND THE WHAT'S COMMUNITY. BUT I WE'RE VARIETY OF HATS FOR EXAMPLE. I WORK EACH YEAR AS AN INFLUENCE THE COORDINATOR TO BRING FLU CLINICS TO WORKING COMMUNITIES WHO OTHERWISE WOULD FIND IT HARD TO GET OFF WORK. THEY MIGHT LOSE PAY. OR THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET A MANAGER'S PERMISSION TO LEAVE WORK. SO THESE WORKING COMMUNITIES HAVE COM. TO RELY ON ANNUAL FREE EVENTS OFTEN HELD ON THE WEEKENDS A COMMUNITY GATHERINGS AND HOUSES OF WORSHIP. MY PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENT TODAY CAME IN MY CURRENT ROLE AS AN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. COLLABORATING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FAITH GROUPS LOCAL BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND EFFORTS ENGAGING HIGH RISK COMMUNITIES AND EMERGENCY AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS EDUCATION AND TRAINING. AS A RESULT I WAS INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THREE TIMES. THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AS IN A WARRANTY AND FOR VARIOUS RECOGNITION EVENT. BUT THAT IS JUST MY SPECIFIC WORK. AS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE CALLED OUT TO SUPPORT THE CORE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT ACUTE. COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL OR AC DC PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES AROUND THE CLOCK DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC SAFETY. AT THE DROP OF A HAT A CDC EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND INVESTIGATORS AND CLINICIANS PROVIDE RAPID RESPONSE. TO ACTIVE AND EMERGENCY EVENTS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE A SUSPECTED FOOD BORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAK AN AREA HOTEL HOSTING A CONFERENCE. ASSESSING A FALSE ALARM ON A BIO HAZARD BREACH. OR HOSPITAL RELATED INFECTION ALARM OR EAT CALL OUTBREAK. PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE AT ACTIVELY SET UP TO SUPPORT THIS RAPID RESPONSE BY HELPING TO CONTAIN AN OUTBREAK. AND PREVENT A CRISES. BE IT AN EPIDEMIC. BE IT AN EPISODIC EVENT. OR INCREASE PER VALENCE OF MENINGITIS TYPHUS WHOOPING COUGH OR TUBERCULOSIS. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERABLY MORE TO NEEDS TO DO CONSIDERABLY MORE TO INVEST IN AND SUPPORT THE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF A DIVERSE. PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING WORKFORCE AS WE ARE LINED WITH AND SUPPORT SO MANY OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. WE ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED IN THE BROADER HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT CONVERSATION. DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE FACING A CRISIS LEVEL SHORTAGE OF TRAINED EXPERIENCED PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS. FOR EXAMPLE A RECENT STUDY FOR FOR HIS PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE IS EXPECTED TO RETIRE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. ANY HEALTHCARE WORKER WORKFORCE INVESTMENT EFFORTS OVER LET THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE ENTIRELY. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE WITH THE RECENTLY RELEASED REPORT FROM THE FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION WHICH CALLED OUT THE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. ALTHOUGH INVESTING IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DID NOT TAKE IT MAKE IT I'M SORRY TO INTO THE COMMISSION'S TOP TEN PRIORITY FOCUS AREA. THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE PIPELINE SIMPLY ISN'T THERE. ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES FACING THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING WORKFORCE IS THAT PRIVATE SECTOR AND ACUTE CARE NURSING JOBS PAY SO MUCH BETTER. EVEN THOUGH OUR NURSES AND STAFF OFTEN HAVE TO TAKE ON MORE STUDENT AT THE SPECIALIZED AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AND TO TOP IT OFF WERE CHARGED HIGHER LICENSING FEES BY THE BOARD OF RESTAURANT REGISTERED NURSING. AND OUR ROLES AS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ARE SPECIALIZED AND GENERALLY SPEAKING REGISTRIES DOWN STAFF PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO CONSIDER ITS INVESTMENT IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AS PART OF ITS PLAN TO ADDRESS THE START DISPARITIES AND HEALTH STATUS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC THAT CAN SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO WHILE THE COMMISSION MAY NOT HAVE MADE IT A PRIORITY I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT THIS COMMITTEE WANTS TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- DOCTOR COBBLER WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR PAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM MAKING CRUMPLER PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY DIRECTOR FOR ORANGE COUNTY. REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY DIRECTORS A NETWORK OF THIRTY ONE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OUR LABORATORIES PLAY AN ESSENTIAL AN IRREPLACEABLE ROLE IN PUBLIC SAFETY BY PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. THEY WERE ESTABLISHED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO BY FORWARD LOOKING COMMUNITY LEADERS AND RESPONSE TO OUTBREAKS OF TYPE. TYPHOID SMALLPOX AND IF THE AREA WHICH ARE FOR NOW CONSIDER DISEASES OF THE PAST. TODAY THEY CONTINUE TO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN COMMUNICABLE DISEASE DETECTION AND SURVEILLANCE. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY NETWORK IS COMPRISED OF A VARIETY OF LABS TAILORED TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITY AND REGION AS WELL AS PROVIDING SURGE CAPACITY TO ENSURE. CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS STATEWIDE. TOGETHER AS A NETWORK THE SYSTEM IS STRONGER IN ABLE TO PROVIDE A TIMELY AND COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE EMERGING THREATS WHICH ARE NOT JUST LIMITED TO INFLUENZA. MEASLES PROTEST THIS ZECA EBOLA AND BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL TERRORISM EVENTS. AS AN EXAMPLE DURING THIS EAGER RESPONSE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN OUR LABS FOR TESTING FOR ZEKE ON PATIENTS WITHIN SEVERAL WEEKS OF RECEIVING TEST KITS FROM THE CDC. IN COMPARISON IT TOOK CLINICAL LABS NEARLY A YEAR TO DEVELOP A AS HE COULD TESTING CAPABILITIES. THIS RAPID RESPONSE WAS DUE TO A WELL ORCHESTRATED COORDINATION BETWEEN THE CDC AND THE NETWORK OF FOURTEEN LOCAL LABS THAT ARE ALSO APPROVED MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL LABORATORY RESPONSE NETWORK. KNOWN AS THE ALR AN EACH COLOR AND LAB HAS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE RESPONSE CAPACITY FOR RAPID DETECTION OF AGENTS CAUSING DISEASES SUCH AS PLAGUE. ANTHRAX AND TOXINS SUCH AS RICE AND THE L. AROUND LABS RECEIVE AND TEST WHITE POWDERS LETTERS AND PACKAGES THAT ARE SENT TO MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. SUCH AS POLITICAL LEADERS AND LAW. FOR CLINICAL LABS ALSO PLAY A ROLE HERE FOR SUSPECTED BIO THREAT IS ISOLATED FROM ONE OF THEIR PATIENTS BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FACILITIES FOR TRAINING. OF AVAILABLE TO PERFORM CONFIRMATIONS ON THE SUSPECT ISOLATES ONLY THE ELLER AND LABS OF THIS UNIQUE CAPABILITY. IN ADDITION TO RESPONSE EFFORTS ARE LAB FOR FOR MANDATED SURVEILLANCE IN THE BACKGROUND UNBEKNOWNST TO MANY FOR DISEASES SUCH AS RABIES SALMONELLA ENTERED THE REGULAR BASIS. MAYBE IF SENIOR FAVORITE RESTAURANT TEMPORARILY CLOSED DUE TO FOOD BORNE ILLNESS INVESTIGATION ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY CLOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS ARE EXPERIENCE A DISEASE OUTBREAK. DURING THESE EXAMPLE EVENTS. STAFF AT OUR LABS WORK AROUND THE CLOCK IF NECESSARY. TO ISOLATE THE CAUSE OF THE OUTBREAK AND TO REDUCE ANY FURTHER SUFFERING BY PATRONS AND RESIDENTS. STAFF MAY EVEN GO OUTSIDE THE LAB TO PERFORM AND FIRE MENTAL TESTING TO ENSURE CONTAMINATED AREAS ARE NOW SAFE. LABS LOCAL LABS ARE IN CLOSE pCOMMUNITY WHICH ALLOWS FOR QUICK AND LESS COSTLY TRANSPORT OF SAMPLES TO OUR LABS FOR TESTING. FOR SOME OUTBREAKS SUCH AS MEASLES A QUICKLY REPORTED RESULT HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON HEALTH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE AND ULTIMATE STOPPING OF DISEASE SPREAD. OR THE RAPID RESPONSE THE TESTING A åENTIALLY ANIMAL THAT BIT A RESIDENT CAN pPATIENT AND REDUCE DEADLY COST RICK REDUCE COSTS OF THIS DEADLY DISEASE. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS TEN LOCAL LABS CLOSED DUE TO COST CUTTING ACTIONS OF THEIR LOCAL DEPARTMENTS OR SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS MAINLY LABORATORY DIRECTORS. TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT TEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE FORTY LABS IN CALIFORNIA WAS NOT PREPARED TO HANDLE THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE H. ONE AND ONE FLU PANDEMIC. OUR LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY REDUCTIONS IN LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL FUNDING. SUCH AS HEALTH REALIGNMENT FAB AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASE FUNDING IT WE ARE FACING INCREASING COST CONTINUED BUDGET REDUCTIONS ENCLOSURE OF LOCAL LABORATORIES WILL REDUCE OVERALL CAPACITY. TO RESPOND TO DISEASE OUTBREAKS IN A TIMELY MANNER AND EVIDENTLY CAUSING HIGHER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RATES AMONG CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. PRIVATE CLINICAL LABORATORIES CANNOT REPLACE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES THEY PERFORM DIFFERENT TESTS FOR DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. CLINICAL LABS ASSESS ONE PATIENT AT A TIME WE ASSESS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. FOR EXAMPLE THE CLINICAL LAB TESTED PATIENTS SPECIMEN FOR SALMONELLA. SO THAT THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CAN TREAT THE PAY SPECIMEN IF POSITIVE FOR SALMONELLA. IS SENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY FOR HIGHLY SPECIALIZED MOLECULAR TESTS TO DETERMINE IF THAT PARTICULAR SALMON ALLAH. IS SIMILAR TO OTHER STRAINS THAT ARE CAUSING LOCAL REGIONAL AND NATIONWIDE OUTBREAKS WE CAN ALSO TEST THE FOOD TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE OUTBREAK AS WELL AS CLEARING EMPLOYEES SO THEY CAN RETURN BACK TO WORK. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING SUCH AS THIS IS NOT PERFORMED IN CLINICAL LABS THEY HAVE NEITHER THE HIGHLY IT NEITHER THE EQUIPMENT OR HIGHLY TRAINED PUBLIC HEALTH MICROBIOLOGISTS YOU CAN DO THIS TYPE OF SURVEILLANCE TESTING. OUR LABS ALSO PERFORM INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE FOR THE DETECTION OF NOVEL FLU STRAINS BY PROVIDING DATA AND SPECIMENS OF THE WHL AND CDC TO HELP PREDICT. WHICH INFLUENZA STRAIN TO INCLUDE AND THE VACCINE FOR NEXT FLU SEASON. IN CLOSING TESTING PROVIDED BY PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES ARE NOT MERELY JUST A SERVICE BUT ACT AS A MECHANISM TO ASSESS THE HEALTH STATUS OF A COMMUNITY. IN THAT VIEW THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES MISSION IS TODAY AS IT WAS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH YOU KNOW MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A TV SHOW ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH LAB LIKE WE OFFER CSI. OKAY DOCTOR DIRECTS WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR HEART AND BY DOING TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME'S HAITI DAY BRICKS I'M NOT ONLY THE YOLO COUNTY EPIDEMIOLOGIST BUT I'M ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF LOCAL HEALTH DATA MANAGES AND EPIDEMIOLOGISTS. EMAIL SENATE CCLI STEAMY WHERE AN AFFILIATE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE LOCAL HELP OFFICES. I'VE BEEN WORKING IN PUBLIC HEALTH SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX AND IT YOLO COUNTY FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS. DURING THAT TIME THAT BEEN GREAT ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN LATE TWENTY TEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLEMENTED THE STATE WIDE ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM CALLED CAL READY. WHERE MANDATED REPORTABLE COMMUNICORP DISEASES AND CONDITIONS ARE SUBMITTED AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO TITLE SEVENTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE REGULATIONS? WITH THE PASSAGE OF A HIGH TECH ACT CALL HEALTH ACT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE HEALTH SYSTEMS WERE INCENTIVIZE TO OUGHT. TO ADOPT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS SO USING EHR ENABLES HEALTH SYSTEMS TO COMMUNICATE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND IN THEORY MAKES IT EASIER TO COME FOR THEM TO COMPLY WITH THEM MANDATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH. IN PRACTICE PROVIDERS ARE STILL RE ENTERING DATA FROM THEIR ELECT CHRONIC HEALTH RECORD INTO CAL READY FOR THE REPORTABLE CONDITIONS. AND ABOUT HALF OF THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE REPORTS THAT WE RECEIVE ARE SUBMITTED TO THE ARE SUBMITTED VIA FAX IN PAPER FORMAT STILL TODAY. THIS YEAR THE CALIFORNIA PALM PUBLIC HEALTH IS IN FINDING THE PILOT STAGE OF FOR A DOCTOR SHIP AS MENTIONED IS KNOWN AS ELECTRONIC CASE REPORTING OR ECR. WITH THE UC DAVIS HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS EFFORT IS PART OF A NATIONWIDE DIGITAL BRIDGE TO STREAMLINE COMMUNICABLEDISEASE REPORTING AND MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROMOTING INTER OPERABILITY ALSO KNOWN AS MEANINGFUL USE. VISIONS OF THE HIGH TECH ACT. SO THE OTHER TWO STATES PILOTING THIS ALL TEXAS IN UTAH. SO ELECTRONIC CASE REPORTING WILL AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT THE INFORMATION FROM THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD WHEN A REPORTER CALLED CONDITION LET'S SAY SYPHILIS IS RECORDED BY THE DOCTOR IN THAT PATIENTS RECORD. THAT DATE WOULD BE A SENT ELECTRONICALLY TO CAL READY AND THENCE TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THUS IT WOULD SAVE HUGE AMOUNTS OF TIME ON THE PROVIDER SIDE AS WELL AS ON THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT SIDE NOT HAVING TO RE ENTER ALL THAT. THAT PATIENT INFORMATION. IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE SPEED COMPLETENESS AND QUALITY OF DATA REPORTING -- OF THE LOCAL HEALTH POINT WHERE I WORK JUST FOR CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA SPENDS ABOUT ONE STAFF DAY PER MONTH TO REQUEST COMMUNICABLE DISEASE REPORTS FROM PROVIDE IS. BASICALLY WE GET ABOUT 60% OF OUR CANADIAN GONORRHEA REPORTS ARE RECEIVED FROM THE PROVIDE WITHOUT AN ASK BUT THE REST OF THEM WE HAVE TO REQUEST THAT WAS ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED FAXES ELECTRONIC FAXES IT WAS SENT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTRONIC CASE REPORTING WOULD ELIMINATE ALL THAT WORK. IT TAKES SIGNIFICANT I. T. INVESTMENT FOR A STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND OUR HEALTH SYSTEMS. TO IMPLEMENT MAJOR CHANGES LIKE LIKE. HEALTH SYSTEMS WILL NEED TO PURCHASE EXTRA SOFTWARE MODULES FOR THEIR EHRS THEY'LL HAVE TO TRAIN IT STAFF AND THEY'LL HAVE TO INTEGRATE THOSE MODELS INTO THEIR EHR SYSTEMS. THE OTHER ISSUE OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS GRAPPLE WITH IS SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE WHICH IS A COLLECTION OF DISEASE DATA FROM HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN REAL TIME. SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE ENABLES LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO OBTAIN DE IDENTIFIED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DATA FROM HOSPITALS IN THAT JURISDICTION'S AND QUICKLY DETECT AND RESPOND TO LOCAL DISEASE OUTBREAKS. CDC HAS MADE AVAILABLE PROGRAM CALLED BIO SINCE TO ANALYZE THESE DATA AND PROVIDES TRAINING FOR LOCAL STAFF TO ON BOARD. NOW MOST STATES NATIONWIDE IMPLEMENTED BY A STATE BY A SENSE AT THE STATE LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTY OR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OFTEN. AN ONBOARDING TAKES THREE TO FOUR MONTHS AND REQUIRES A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME. AND TRAINING MOST OF THOSE WHO WOULD BE COUNTY WE CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SIXTY ONE HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AS YOU HEARD EARLY ON ELEVEN OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY ON BY A SENSE. AND MOST OF THOSE WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN JOINING SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TIME TO SPARE. WE ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS INTO TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE A COUPLE WITH THAT WE ENCOURAGE INVESTMENTS IN HUMAN CAPITAL NEEDED TO SUPPORT THOSE SYSTEMS. THIS INCLUDES STRENGTHENING STAFFING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS YOU'VE HEARD MANY TIMES TODAY AND PROVIDING FUNDING FOR ON GOING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL SYSTEM ASSISTANCE FOR STAFF. DATA IS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT TO THE WORK WE DO AND AS YOU CONSIDER BUILDING AND INVESTING INTO THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION. YOU FOR THAT YOUR TIME. RIGHT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU OFFER YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- ACTUALLY -- MR WINDOW WITH IF YOU HAVE A COPY OF YOUR REMARKS WE'D LIKE TO BE SURE CAPTURE ALL THE NUMBERS YOU RATTLED OFF. THE FUNDING SO -- APPRECIATE THAT -- IN TERMS OF THE I. T. -- WORK -- ACTUALLY -- BUT IF YOU BE IMPORTANT TO CERTAIN SAME WAY ASKED ABOUT. THE ASSESSING CAPACITY AND AND AND THAT'S NOT LEAST WORKFORCE BUT ALSO OTHER THINGS BUT THE ABOUT LIKE. WHAT KIND OF I. T. PROPOSALS WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO BRING TO US SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AND THAT PERHAPS THE -- C. PH COULD HELP FIGURE OUT A AND WITH THE LOCAL HELP THERE'S AB THE A IN I. T. PACKAGE RIGHT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT BUT I KNOW WE LEAVING THERE'S LOTS OF IT PROJECTS THAT FLEW AROUND OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES BUT I THINK IT'D BE. GOOD TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR PERSONNEL -- ALSO I MEAN THAT'S WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE THAT AND CERTAINLY I THE DATA SYSTEMS WILL REPLACE YOU KNOW THE BUT I CAN CERTAINLY HELP IMPROVE EFFICIENCY THERE RIGHT I COULD DEFINITELY MAKE US DO MORE WORK FASTER YEAH. AND DINO TERMS OF OUR WORK FORCE EIGHT EIGHT THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S COME OUT FROM BOTH THIS PANEL IN THE LAST PANEL -- IT AS I AND THEN MAYBE PERHAPS -- THERE'S ALSO YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS IS THAT I NEED TO IT. IS IT'S GOT LIKE -- COMMITTEE POLICE WORK RIGHT I MEAN IT'S BOOTS ON THE GROUND TALKING TO PEOPLE -- IT DELAYED AND AND AND AND BUILDING THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE SO THEY'LL SHARE WITH YOU PRETTY SENSITIVE INFORMATION -- ABOUT THEMSELVES ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE THEY KNOW IN THE COMMUNITY HAVING THAT TRUST. AND SO FORTH AND AND AND REALLY THE GROUND THERE AND THE US SPEAK TO THAT I MEAN YOUR SECOND GENERATION -- SHOE LEATHER -- PUBLIC HEALTH -- YOU KNOW ABIGAIL WORKER SO YEAH. DEFINITELY -- EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT -- IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD RAPPORT WITH THE COMMUNITY -- THAT TRUST -- FOR SOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS IT TAKES TIME AND SO WHAT WE KNOW AS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES IS YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY. HELPS -- TO DELIVER THAT MISSION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DELIVER AND SO REALLY BEING OUT -- ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY ON A REGULAR BASIS BEING VISIBLE -- IN EL. BEING COMPETENT. AND WHAT WE DO OUR OUR NURSES ARE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE A LOT OF FEES THE NURSES THAT WE WANNA RETAIN IN THE DEPARTMENT. AND SO DEFINITELY -- SOMETHING THAT WE VALUE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU AND A VOICE SAID THAT -- YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH THE QUOTE SAME CREDENTIALS DEGREES WHATEVER ELSE BUT THAT RELATIONSHIP HAS VALUE AND SO THE PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE WHICH IS THAT CAN BE INTERCHANGED JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME OF THIS EVEN. SO WE CERTAINLY NEED TO BUILD A PIPELINE AND PEOPLE AND THERE IN THE YOU KNOW IT IN THE COMMUNITY IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO SWITCH PEOPLE OUT. WITH EACH OTHER RIGHT AT THE ANY TAKES. IT'S NOT JUST THE SKILL LEVEL IT'S ALSO THE RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS MATTERED AND AND AND HEALTHCARE. LABS I DISS SO TELL ME WHAT'S SO WE HAVE. CAN BE -- SO TELL ME WHAT THE LAB STRUCTURE ME YOU HAVE WE HAVE STATE THE ACCOUNT IS SO. WHAT'S RELATIONS BETWEEN THAT A COUNTIES AND THE STATE REGARDING LABORATORY SERVICES AND ALSO BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES ANY THE THE IT'S LIKE BECAUSE A QUESTION -- IS IT EFFICIENT FOR WELL LET'S SEE. EIGHT IT DOESN'T SOUND VERY EFFICIENT FOR EVERY COUNTY TO HAVE DROWNED LAB RIGHT NOT THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT WE SHOULD TO SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT MORE REGIONALIZATION WE WANT TO BE SURE IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH SO WE CAN GET SAMPLES TOO QUICKLY OR EIGHT BUT WE DO HAVE. VARIOUS MODES OF TRANSPORTATION -- BUT THE ONLY TALK ABOUT RARE CONDITIONS IN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU MORE CAPACITY SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THE WAY WE CURRENTLY HAVE STRUCTURED THE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES AND AND SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. THAT I I DON'T KNOW IT WAS THE THE THE LEVEL WE HAVE REGIONALIZATION MORE RECENTLY SOME LESS REGIONALIZATION. THE YOUR SO WE EACH COUNTY OPERATES IN THE INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER SO WE ARE ALL SEPARATED FISCALLY HOWEVER WE DO -- HAVE STATEWIDE NETWORKS THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN SO WE HAVE THE STATE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LABS -- THERE SEVERAL NETWORKS -- WHERE COUNTY LABS DO TESTING FOR THINGS LIKE INFLUENZA NOROVIRUS BECAUSE THERE'S LIMITED CAPACITY AT THE STATE AND WE TEST AT OUR AT OUR LOCAL LEVELS -- THERE ARE SOME WE DO HAVE SOME GREAT -- EXAMPLES OF LABS THAT HAVE. REGIONAL LABS -- WELL COUNTIES -- WHERE WE START TO SEE SOME -- SOME -- DROPS AND COVERAGE -- ARE IS AN R. L. OVER OUR ELLER EN PROGRAM SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ONE LABORATORY THAT SUPPORTING -- NINE NINE JURISDICTIONS -- BECAUSE OF SOME LABORATORY CLOSURES AND SO THIS AND FOR THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS WHERE YOU NEED ANSWERS IMMEDIATELY THERE ARE LARGE DISTANCES TO TRAVEL BY. A CAREER YOU KNOW TO GET THERE SO IT DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYS THE RESPONSE FOR FOR THOSE KIND OF FOR THOSE KIND OF EVENTS -- BUT I I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN -- WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND LOOKING OUT BUT YOU KNOW OVER ALWAYS SERVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE SON ORANGE COUNTY A SURF THREE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE. OF AND WE HAVE A LAB OF FIFTY STAFF THOUSAND TEST -- SO IT REALLY IS DEPENDENT ON THE LOCATION THAT GEOGRAPHY -- THE POPULATION OF THE THE REGION OR THE AREA THAT IS SERVED. THANK YOU.
