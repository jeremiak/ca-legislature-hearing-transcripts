AND TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT.

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:22.868
THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.671

EXEMPTIONS.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.489
IS THE LAST THING I'LL SAY.

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:44.923
YESTERDAY I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.425
AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.626
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:49.261
SPEAKING BROADLY ABOUT TIMBER

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.263
PRACTICES OUR DEPARTMENT IS

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.599
ENGAGE.

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.300
BUT IT'S I THINK.

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:57.035
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TRY TO CLEAR

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:59.471
UP ANY CONFUSION.

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:03.675
UNDER ASSEMBLY BILL.

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:04.176
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO OUR

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:05.777
DEPARTMENT IS GAUGED IN TIMBER

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:07.646
HARVEST REVIEWS.

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:09.414
IT'S TRADITIONAL WORK WE DO IT

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.683
WELL WE ARE CONSOLIDATING OUR

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.986
WORK WITH STATE AGENCIES.

00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:15.320
AND THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:16.989
WHETHER THE TREND LINES ON WORK

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:19.725
PRODUCT INEFFICIENCIES ARE GOING

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:20.993
UP OR DOWN.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:23.195
THE TIMELINESS IS FASTER OR

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.330
SLOWER.

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:27.699
AND I WENT BACK AND READ THE TWO

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:29.368
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN REPORT

00:19:29.434 --> 00:19:31.904
SUBMITTED BY OUR AGENCY TO THE

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.806
LEGISLATURE I THINK IN DECEMBER.

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:35.774
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THOSE TREND

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:38.310
LINES ON THE ALREADY EXISTING

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:39.978
RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:42.414
THEY'RE NOT ALL COMPREHENSIVELY

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:43.749
TRENDING DOWNWARD.

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:44.816
EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT PRE

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:47.286
HARVEST INSPECTIONS CONDUCTED

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.388
THAT METRIC FOR OUR DEPARTMENT

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:50.822
WAS ACTUALLY MUCH HIGHER.

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.658
AYE IN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.960
THAN THE PRECEDING TWO YEARS.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.162
SO ANOTHER METRICS YOU WOULD

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.430
FIND IN THAT RPORT IS.

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:01.300
WE STILL DO OUR OTHER PERMITTING

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.701
UNDER STREAMBED ALTERATION

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:03.535
AGREEMENTS.

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:04.603
AND IT'S ALL TAKE PERMITS IF YOU

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.407
LOOK AT WORKLOAD FOR SIXTEEN

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:09.775
HUNDRED AGREEMENTS AND SIXTEEN

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.476
HUNDRED X. INSPECTIONS.

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:12.911
THEY'VE ACTUALLY INCREASED.

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.480
OVER THE MOST RECENT REPORTING

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.316
PERIOD NOT DECREASE.

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.750
OF COURSE IN THIS REPORT YOU CAN

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:19.651
FIND SOME OTHER METRICS WHICH

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:21.386
SELECT THEY MAY BE GOING THE

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:22.854
OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:24.089
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:26.525
BUT FOR ME.

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:28.660
IT'S NOT A TOPIC ABOUT SENATE

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:32.097
BILL NINE A ONE SENATE BILL NINE

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:35.467
OH ONE COMES AFTER.

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:36.101
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO SENATE BILL

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:38.136
NINE A ONE IS ABOUT DEALING WITH

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:40.138
CATASTROPHIC FIRE RISK IT

00:20:40.205 --> 00:20:41.540
CREATES A NEW WORKLOAD.

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.041
BECAUSE OF THE USE OF IMPORTANT

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:44.776
EXEMPTIONS.

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.612
THE GET CAL FAR WITH SMALL

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:49.247
TIMBER OWNERS AND OTHERS OUT

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:50.716
REMOVING.

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:53.185
THINGS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THAT

00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:54.953
RISK THAT'S A NEW WORKLOAD.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.121
AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:57.155
DISTINCTION AND OUR BUDGET

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:59.558
CHANGE PROPOSALS ABOUT THAT NEW

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.126
WORKLOAD.

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:02.961
ANOTHER DOCTOR OKAY SO

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:03.261
[inaudible]

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:04.863
WE JUST.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.331
PART OF THE FUNDING MECHANISM

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.800
THAT WE HAVE FOR THE WORK IS THE

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:09.901
GREENHOUSE --

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:13.672
DATE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS WE

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.307
JUST FINISH THE THIRD OPTION AND

FOUR BILLION DOLLARS.

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:21.013
WHICH IS WHAT THIS BUDGET HAS IN

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:21.813
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.749
THERE APPEARS TO BE AN

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:27.052
AUGMENTATION COMING FOR FUNDS

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.720

ARENA.

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:36.194
I THINK SOME PEOPLE WOULD SUBMIT

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:39.498
THAT THE A ROBUST.

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:43.402
TIMBER REGULATION IN REDUCTION --

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:44.569
UP UP PROGRAM WILL BE ONE OF

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.004
THOSE VARIABLES THAT MAY HELP US

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:47.639
REDUCE GREENHOUSE.

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:51.843

00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:58.050
MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE ON

00:21:58.116 --> 00:21:59.651
DISCRETIONARY FUNDING.

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:00.852
SO WE COULD BE LOOKING AT A

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:02.087
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:04.523
AND AND THAT THE LIST IS IS.

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:07.859
ABUNDANT THE LEASE IN RESILIENCY.

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.728
THIS SEEMS TO BE A BIG.

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:11.930
BIG --

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:14.032

IN THE THREE POINT FOR THAT

00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:29.281
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING.

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:39.391
AUGMENTATION.

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:42.160
IS THAT DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WITH

00:22:42.227 --> 00:22:44.096

WE DO IN A PRE POSITIONING

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.900
RESOLUTION THEN YOU'RE GOING

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:50.202

THERE IS IN MY EXPERIENCE AN

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:58.910
IMMENSE AMOUNT OF COORDINATION

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:00.679
BETWEEN CAL FIRE [inaudible]

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:08.720
QUALITY CONTROL BOARD.

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:10.388
THAT INTEGRATION AND

00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:12.591
COLLABORATION MUST CONTINUE TO

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:14.226
EXIST TO BE SUCCESSFUL ANDERSON

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:16.928
A BILL NINE A ONE I THINK AN

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:19.097
IMPORTANT PART OF SENATE BILL

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:20.465
NINE A ONE AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:23:20.532 --> 00:23:23.535
IS A PATHWAY FOR THE SMALLER NON

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.419
REASONABLE REQUEST FOR THIS TIME

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:43.021
FRAME.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:45.357

TWO YEARS AGO I THINK WITH THE

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:21.253
LATEST DATA THAT WE HAD.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.255
WHERE IT LOOKED AT STAFF

I AND THEN NINE NINE A ONE I

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.124
THINK WHERE THE CONCERN.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.759
IS [inaudible]

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:03.428
IF.

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:05.563
THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION IF.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:06.164
FOUR THREE TIMBER FOLKS WE'RE

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:08.300
GONNA BE TAXING THEMSELVES THERE

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.735
WOULD BE --

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:12.771
A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TURN

00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:14.906
AROUND TIME. FOR TIMBER HARVEST

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:16.875
PLANTS.

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:18.510
AND IF WE'RE NOT SEEN THAT PLAY

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:19.411
OUT.

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:23.148
TAKING DOLLARS FROM. FOURTEEN

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:24.316
NINETY TWO TO BE ABLE TO COVER

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:26.484
OBLIGATIONS FOR NINE A ONE

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:29.087
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.655
BUT MEDIA TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:31.723
TO BETTER DETERMINE THAT IN THE

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.692
FOR ONLY TALKING TWO MILLION

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:34.559
DOLLARS [inaudible]

00:26:34.626 --> 00:26:36.895
THEN.

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:38.897
I AND I DON'T MEAN THAT USED TO

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:40.332
MILLION LIGHTLY.

00:26:40.398 --> 00:26:43.034
ARMED BUT BIG PICTURE.

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.602
LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:47.205

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:52.310
AND WOULD LIKE TO BE TO FIGURE

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:53.712

THIS AGAIN IT IS FAIR TO SAY.

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:04.889
THE TIMBER TAX WAS MEANT TO BE

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.391

NUMBER STAFF NO INJURIES AND

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:12.464
THEN TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.566
DOLLARS AWAY IF WE STILL HAVE

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:16.067

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:51.696
DEPARTMENT.

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:53.531
SHRUNK OTHER PERMITTING.

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:55.400
TIMELINE STRAIGHT AND WAS MORE

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:56.034
EFFICIENT SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:58.002
THE DATA.

00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:00.071
I WILL TELL YOU ALSO.

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:03.508
THAT UNDER SENATE BILL NINE A

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:05.477
ONE IN MY IMPRESSION THERE'S

00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:06.578
SOMETHING GOING ON HERE THAT

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:08.379
RELATES TO THE DATA YOU ARE

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:09.481
LOOKING AT AROUND OUR

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:13.151
TRADITIONAL WORK --

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:15.120
I THINK A THING THAT'S HAPPENED

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:17.755
IS EXEMPTION NOTIFICATIONS HAD

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:19.591
BEEN TRENDING HIGHER OVER THE

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:21.025
LAST REPORTED FOUR YEAR PERIOD

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:22.994
ANYWAY.

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:25.497
EVEN BEFORE YOU GET S. B. NINE A

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:27.665
ONE NEW EXEMPTIONS AND PLAY. FOR

00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:28.733
EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT TWO

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.735
THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN AS

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:33.104
I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE ONE

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:33.638
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.673
NINETY NOTIFICATIONS. FOR

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.442
EXEMPTIONS AND BY THE TIME YOU

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:39.644
GET.

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:40.278
TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:41.846
WERE.

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:42.447
THREE THOUSAND TEN NOTICES OF

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:43.114
EXEMPTIONS YOU'RE ALMOST GETTING

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.049
A DOUBLING OF EXEMPTIONS UNDER

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.184
THE OLDER.

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:48.653
AVAILABILITY NOW WE'RE ADDING

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.155
POTENTIALLY NEW EXEMPTIONS WE

00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:51.489
NEED TO EXPLOIT TO REDUCE

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:52.790
CATCHES FIRE RISK.

00:29:52.857 --> 00:29:54.225
SO I PROJECT THE NUMBER OF

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:56.261
EXEMPTIONS JUST KEEPS

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:57.829
ACCELERATING.

00:29:57.896 --> 00:29:58.897
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:01.132
PROMPTLY UTILIZE THOSE

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:03.434
EXEMPTIONS TO GET PEOPLE OUT

00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:04.669
REMOVING TIMBER.

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.104
AND THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:07.772
WHETHER ONE OF THE METRICS IS A

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.340
COURAGEOUS.

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:11.442
ARE YOU APPROVING MORE ACRES

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:13.545
UNDER T. H. PEAS WELL I'LL JUST

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:15.346
SAY IS WE'VE SEEN THIS SHIFT.

00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:17.348
ANY WAY.

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:19.217
TOWARDS EXEMPTIONS.

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:20.919
THAT NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS I JUST

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:22.153
MENTIONED IS INVOLVING MORE

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.255
ACRES.

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:25.857
IT'S ALMOST THREE POINT FIVE

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:27.158
MILLION ACRES IN THE LAST

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:29.027

IN AROUND EXEMPTIONS.

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:32.430
AND I THINK THOSE TRENDS WILL

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.566
CONTINUE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:36.234
SUGGESTING FIFTEEN PEOPLE.

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:37.735

UNDER FOURTEEN NINETY TWO UNDER.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.603

CURRENT LAW FOR THE USE OF THE

ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILL TO

FEDERAL IN FINANCE I I THINK

00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:46.057
THAT -- JUST

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:48.226
BECAUSE IT DOES DOESN'T MEAN

00:33:48.292 --> 00:33:50.895

THE FACT THAT IT WAS DEDICATED.

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.620
TO MAKING SURE WE HAD A ROBUST

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:24.555
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:26.257
TIMBER HARVESTING ACTIVITIES.

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:26.958
IS THAT HOW YOU GOT THE

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:28.159
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE TO THE

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:29.627
TABLE ON THIS ENTIRE BILL WHICH

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:30.895
WAS OTHERWISE REALY VERY

00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.697
FOCUSED ON YOU KNOW BENEFITS FOR

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:35.099
OF LANDOWNERS AND PROCESS.

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.567
THIS IS ALL HAPPENING AT A POINT

00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:37.068
WE'RE COMING OUT OF THE

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:40.104
RECESSION DURING WHICH TIME.

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:41.606
THE DEPARTMENT'S GENERALLY AND

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.140
FISH AND WILDLIFE IN PARTICULAR

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:44.909
WERE ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED.

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.143
I MEAN THE CUTS THAT HAPPENED TO

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.445
THE TIMBER HARVEST REVIEW TEAMS

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:50.915
THERE AND THAT ERA WERE JUST.

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.550
WIDELY OUT OF PROPORTION WITH

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:55.653
THE REST OF WHAT HAPPENED AND

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.621
THE IN STATE BUDGET.

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:58.990
SO THAT WAS WHY WE WERE SUPPORT

00:35:59.056 --> 00:36:01.792
OF OF AB FORTY NINETY TWO IT'S

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:02.927
NOT JUST ABOUT STREAMLINING

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.328
PERMITS THERE WAS LANGUAGE THERE.

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:07.265
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE --

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:08.766
PROCESSING TOMORROW'S PLANS MORE

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.635
EFFICIENTLY AND TRACKING THAT

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:11.302
GETTING THE RECORDS IN THE

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:12.870
NUMBERS ARE THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.138
PART OF IT.

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:15.473
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE HAVE AN

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.641
ASSESSMENT THESE AS ONE ON

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:19.176
LUMBER CONSUMERS IS TO MAKE SURE

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:19.777
WE HAVE A ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.012
REVIEW.

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:23.014
BUT AS ONE OF THEIR CORRECT THAT

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.016
CONTEXT A LITTLE BIT NOT HAPPY.

00:36:25.082 --> 00:36:28.286
TO FOLLOW UP WITH A NEW

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:32.890
SEPARATELY IF YOU'D LIKE.

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:34.992
I MEAN THAT YEAH.

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:35.459
HAPPY TO HELP.

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:36.227
ALL OF THEM BUT THEY WANNA COME

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:37.762
BACK AROUND TO THIS PARTICULAR

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:40.197
PROPOSAL --

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:43.234
SB NINE A ONE CONVERSATIONS SO

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:43.834
FOR STRESS AND OTHER THAN THE

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:44.969
NORMAL COMMUNITY WERE VERY

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:46.437
INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE.

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:47.905
THAT THE REVIEW TEAM AGENCIES

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:51.676
WE'RE GOING TO BE AT THE TABLE --

00:36:51.742 --> 00:36:53.077
WERE INVOLVED IN SOME.

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:54.211
MANNER AS BEST YOU CAN WITH A

00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:55.179
MINISTERIAL PERMIT AROUND THESE

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:56.681
EXEMPTIONS AND SO WE'RE VERY

00:36:56.747 --> 00:36:58.516
HAPPY TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:36:58.583 --> 00:36:59.750
IN A PROPOSED THE AUGMENTATION

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:00.585
FOR BOTH THE STATE WATER

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:02.653
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND THE

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.422
F. W..

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:05.790
MORE SPEAKING MORE BROADLY THAN

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:07.291
JUST ABOUT THESE EXEMPTIONS AS

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:08.859
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING ALL

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:09.927
THIS FUEL REDUCTION WORK.

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:11.862
LET'S NOT LOSE TRACK THAT FUELS

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:12.663
REDUCTION IS HABITAT

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:13.798
MODIFICATION.

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:15.066
AND THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:16.367
WE'RE DOING AND THAT CAN BE GOOD

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:18.002
THERE'S MANY MANY PLACES IN THE

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.303
FORESTS WERE GETTING INTO TAKING

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.471
A BUNCH OF TREES OUT.

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:21.706
AND TRYING TO RESTORE SOME

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:22.406
STRUCTURE IS EXACTLY WHAT WE

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:23.641
WANT TO BE DOING YOU CAN ALSO BE

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:26.844
BAD THAT'S WHY WE HAVE --

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:28.546
AGENCIES TO HELP WITH THE SORT

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:29.981
OF A OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE SO I

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:30.848
ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.149
THINKING ABOUT THIS MORE BROADLY

00:37:32.216 --> 00:37:34.051
THAN JUST WE ONE MIXER WERE

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:35.453
TRACKING ALL THE EXEMPTIONS.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.787
AND AS WE'RE TRYING TO SCALE UP

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:38.322
TO HALF A MILLION ACRES A YEAR

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:40.191
OF YOUR FUEL REDUCTION FORCE

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:42.560
RESTORATION ACTIVITIES ANNUALLY.

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:44.662
LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:46.063
DIFFERENT.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.932
RUSTY AGENCIES FULLY ENGAGED IN

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.133
SORT OF PLANNING THATRIGHT NOW

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.401
THERE ARE YOU KNOW OUT LOOKING

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:52.370
INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AS THEY

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:53.738
SHOULD AND WORKING WITH THE

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:54.805
OTHER REVIEW TEAMS --

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:56.240
YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT BUT

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:57.441
I THINK WE REALLY WANT TO BE

00:37:57.508 --> 00:37:59.877
MORE PROACTIVE ABOUT LOOKING AT

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:00.778
WHAT WE'RE DOING WHERE WE'RE

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:01.779
DOING AND THEY WERE GETTING THE

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.781
BEST BENEFITS BOTH FOR FIRE

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:04.448
REDUCTION AND HABITAT

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:06.884
RESTORATION.

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.719
ACROSS WATERSHED THANK.

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:11.255
NEXT AT THIS OF WILL THERE BE A

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:13.257
CONVERSATION ABOUT OTHER SB NINE

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:15.893
A ONE BCP'S AT SOME OTHER TIME

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.762
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:18.929
ABSOLUTELY [inaudible]

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:23.100
ABSOLUTELY.

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:23.834
YOUR SINGLE PICKY WITH A

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:26.003
CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION --

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.405
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME SERIOUS

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:28.639
CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO THIS

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:30.708
VCP LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.877
ABOUT A. B. --

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:33.511
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO PAUL MASONS

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:35.046
CORRECT THAT PART OF THE PURPOSE

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:36.580
OF FOURTEEN NINETY TWO WAS TO

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:37.515
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD THE

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:39.050
ABILITY TO DO.

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:41.185
A PROFICIENT REVIEW OF TIMBER

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:42.987
HARVESTING ACTIVITIES --

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:44.355
IN ADDITION TO THAT THOUGH TWICE

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:45.723
IN THE BILL IT STATES ABOUT

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.358
CREATING THE EFFICIENCES AROUND

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:48.993
THAT WORK SO EFFICIENCIES WAS

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.796
ABSOLUTELY A PART OF AB.

00:38:51.862 --> 00:38:52.396
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND THAT

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:53.998
SORT OF WHERE IT TIES INTO --

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:56.233
THE ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:56.901
THAT WAS MENTIONED BY SEVERAL OF

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:59.236
YOU UP HERE --

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:02.473
THE LAST REPORT WE SEEN WAS IN

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.007
TWENTY AS MISTER BONNER.

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:03.674
POINTED OUT --

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.843
WE HAVE WE'VE NEVER SEEN A

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:06.577
TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT AND WE

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:07.912
HAVEN'T SEEN A TWENTY NINETEEN

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:08.979
REPORT AND THAT WAS DOING

00:39:09.046 --> 00:39:11.015
JANUARY TENTH OF THIS YEAR --

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:13.184
AND THE TREND IN THE TWENTY

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.386
SEVENTEEN REPORT WAS THAT P. WHY

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:18.055
WENT UP BY --

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:20.057
TWENTY SUBMITTED TEACH PEACE WAS

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:22.526
DOWN THE INCARCERATED WAS DOWN

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:23.394
AND REVIEW TIME WENT UP BY

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:24.261
TWENTY DAYS.

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:26.130
SO FOR US THOSE NUMBERS ARE

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.765
GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION --

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:29.333
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.167
EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN REPORT

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:31.302
BECAUSE WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS THAT

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:33.104
TREND CONTINUING HOW WE REVERSE

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.371
THAT TREND AND THAT'S PART OF

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:35.906
THE PURPOSE OF THOSE AND OF THAT

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.241
ANNUAL REPORT --

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:38.743
AND IT'S ALSO THE TIED TO SB

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:39.877
NINE A ONE THE REQUESTING THE

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:41.579
MONEY FROM FOURTEEN NINETY TWO

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.981
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED.

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:44.415
TO SEE SOME OF THESE

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:45.416
EFFICIENCIES.

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:46.417
I THINK WE ALSO CONCERNED WITH

00:39:46.484 --> 00:39:47.752
THE TWELVE POSITIONS FUNDED

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.820
UNDER --

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.455
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO BECAUSE OF

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:53.157
THE BC PIECE STATES THAT.

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:55.025
SB NINE A ONE REQUIRES FISH AND

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:56.560
WILDLIFE TO REVIEW NOTICES OF

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.229
EXEMPTIONS I'M ACTUALLY IT

00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:00.231
DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO REVIEW A

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:01.332
NOTICE OF EXEMPTION.

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:03.534
IT'S AN EXEMPTION FROM HAVING TO

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:04.769
DO A TIMBER HARVESTING PLAN.

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:06.604
IT'S A MINISTERIAL DOCUMENT THAT

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.339
NEITHER REQUIRES THE REVIEW

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:09.540
NORTHERN APPROVAL --

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:11.976
IT IS NOT A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.277
WHICH THEY ARE PARTNERS WITH

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:14.912
VISION WHILE I AM SORRY WITH CAL

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:16.347
FIRE AT THE TABLE OF THE REVIEW

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:18.816
AGENCY --

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:19.383
CAL FIRE IS THE ONE THAT WE

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:23.554
SUBMIT THE TO CAL FIRE SOMEONE

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:25.689
TO DETERMINE IF THE NOTICE IS

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.091
COMPLETE AND ACCURATE.

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:29.126
AND THEN WE CAN SUBMIT WE CAN

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:30.361
START COMMENCING OUR WORK

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:32.163
EFFICIENT WILDLIFE IS INTERESTED

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:33.898
AND ADDING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:35.032
TO DO MONITORING.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:36.767
OF THE POST WORK TO ENSURE THAT

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:39.170
ALL THE FORCE PRACTICE RULES ARE --

00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:41.138
APPLIED WE DON'T NECESSARILY

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:42.940
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT WE

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:44.909
THINKTHAT THOSE POSITIONS

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:45.976
SHOULD BE FOCUSED WHERE THE MOST.

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:47.244
TIMBER HARVEST ACTIVITIES ARE

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:49.246
BEING ARE TAKING PLACE FISH AND

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.614
WILDLIFE DIVIDES THE STATE UP

00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:52.483
INTO SIX DIFFERENT REGIONS. TWO

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.819
OF WHICH ARE THE INLAND DESERT

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.387
AND THE SOUTH COAST REGION FISH

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:57.555
AND WILDLIFE IS SEEKING TO

00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.256
POSITIONS IN THOSE AREAS WE

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:00.925
LOOKED AT THE ACTIVITIES THAT

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:02.426
WERE DONE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:03.460
THOSE TWO REGIONS.

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:04.695
BETWEEN THOSE TWO REGIONS

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:08.399
TOGETHER WE HAD A TOTAL OF ONE

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:09.900
EXEMPTION. ONE LESSON THREE ACRE

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.435
CONVERSION AND ZERO TIMBER

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:13.537
HARVEST PLANS SO WE FAIL TO SEE

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:14.805
THE NEED TO HIRE TWO ADDITIONAL

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:17.208
STAFFERS FOR THAT ROBUST WORK

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:19.143

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:27.911
THE REGION THERE'S CERTAINLY A

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.412
LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING TO BE

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.981
GOING ON AROUND.

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:32.916
EDUCATION MANAGEMENT HABITAT

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:35.886
RESTORATION AROUND RESILIENCY SO

NEW APPROACHES ARE INTENT IS

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.201
ALWAYS JUST CRYSTAL CLEAR SO

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.537
THAT'S A DEAL WITH THE

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:59.543
CATASTROPHIC RISK FACTOR --

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.614
THINK IS TRYING TO SUGGEST

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:07.183
THERE'S NOT INDUSTRIAL TIMBER.

LANDOWNERS --

00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:27.537

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:29.072
GOVERNMENT HAS CONTROL OVER THE

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:30.440

THE THE CAR AND THE MENDOCINO

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:13.675
COMPLEX.

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:14.910
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:16.745
ALL SUMMER LONG AND SOME OF

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:18.747
THOSE SAME PEOPLE --

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.849
WATCHED THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.587
COUPLE WEEKS AGO TO TALK WITH

AFTER THE CAMPFIRE IN PARTICULAR

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:47.676
BECAUSE OF OF THE THE IMPACT IT

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:50.479
HAD TO OUR POLICE I THINK IT

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:52.314
IGHT BE USEFUL I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.116

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:01.323
THE TEAM MEMBERS.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.859
THE TECH CAN'T BE A GROUNDS FOR

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:07.729
RETALIATION OR LOSING AN

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:11.366

PROTECTING EMPLOYEES WHO ASSERT

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:21.510
THEIR RIGHTS NOT BEING SUBJECT

SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:30.118

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:34.476
THAT IS --

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:37.212
UNDER THE SEA --

THE START UP COSTS --

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.554
FOR THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM --

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.622
WE ARE IN WHEN WE'RE OUT WE WE

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:48.857
ARE AWARE THAT --

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:49.825
LA -- HAS

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.626
SOME CONTINUED QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:53.228
THAT STARTUP COSTS THAT I I

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.530
REFERENCED AND WE ARE WORKING WE

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:57.132
HAVE ONE OUTSIDE OUTSTANDING

01:18:57.199 --> 01:19:00.302
ITEM THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING --

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:02.571
TO SUPPLY THAT INFORMATION TO LA --

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:06.908
ON AND WILL THE REPORT BACK ONCE

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:08.510
WE HAVE --

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:11.546
FINALIZE THAT AND SO LISTER FOR

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.582
THE QUESTIONS THAT'S THE LA --

01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:17.586
HERE.

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:18.186
IF YOU DON'T FACT A ANALYST'S

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.187
OFFICE.

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:21.389
AND SO LOOKING AT THE AND ALL OF

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:22.924
THE PROPOSALS TOGETHER AS A

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.726
PACKAGE AND WE WE DO THINK THAT

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.461
IT IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE STATE

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:28.163
TO CONSIDER INCREASING ITS FIRE

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.465
RESPONSE CAPACITY RESOURCES.

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.234
AND GIVEN THAT THE SEVERITY OF

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.368
RECENT FIRE CONDITIONS IN THE

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.237
LIKELY HAD THAT THAT CONTINUES

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:36.438
WITH -- THE

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:37.472
ONGOING EFFECTS OF THE DROUGHT

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:39.040
BURKE BEETLE INFESTATION IN AND

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:40.876
OTHER CONDITIONS CLIMATE CHANGE

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:42.277
AS WELL.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.011
I AM AND SO WE THINK INCREASING

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:46.181
RESOURCES OVERALL IS REASONABLE --

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:47.849
WE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.951
REQUIRE CAL FIRE TO WORK WITH IT

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:51.720
WE ASKED TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.088
WHAT THEIR EXISTING FIRE

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:54.789
RESPONSE CAPACITY.

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:58.093
IS AND WHAT THE GAPS ARE AND TO

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.629
PRIORITIZE WEIGHTS AND WE'RE

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.397
RESOURCES COULD BE ADDED.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.132
ON AND WAIT AND IMPROVEMENT IN

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:05.300
GOALS AND OUTCOMES THAT WOULD

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:07.169
ACHIEVE AND WE THINK THAT THAT

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:11.173
WOULD HELP YOU TO AND EVALUATE.

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:11.973
FUTURE REQUEST THAT --

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.208
CAM GONNA COME IN THIS IT'S IT'S

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.342
LIKELY THAT THIS IS NOT THE

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:16.311
FINAL REQUEST FOR INCREASING AND

01:20:16.378 --> 01:20:17.579
FIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY YOU'VE

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:18.980
PROVIDED A LOT OF MONEY IN THE

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:19.948
CURRENT YEAR.

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:22.918
THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.153
IN THIS BUDGET ON AND COMING

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.221
YEARS AND SO WE THINK THIS

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:27.789
ASSESSMENT WOULD REALLY HELP

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:28.890
INFORM.

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:31.092
ON THE FUTURE DECISIONS THAT YOU

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.028
ARE LIKELY GOING TO NEED TO MAKE

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.996
TO ENSURE THAT INCREASE

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.164
RESOURCES ARE PAID AND THE

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:38.633
HIGHEST PRIORITY AREAS AND THE

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.135
INCREASES ARE DONE IN THE MOST

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:41.503
COST EFFECTIVE WAY.

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:44.639
THAT'S THE SORT OF OVERALL AND

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:47.042
WITH REGARD TO THE THE C. --

01:20:47.108 --> 01:20:48.677
ONE THIRTY TANKERS THAT THE

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.045

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.780
SOMEWHAT LACKING IN DETAIL AND

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:53.348
THAT WE WE TYPICALLY EXPECT TO

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:54.649
SEE WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:20:54.716 --> 01:20:56.952
COMPONENTS REALLY ESSENTIALLY

01:20:57.018 --> 01:21:02.157
INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS PACKED.

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.758
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:05.026
THIS HE WENT --

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:06.494
THIRTY TANKERS ON THAT THE

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.363
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.699
HELPFUL AND RESPONSIVE TO ASK IN

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:11.766
THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:14.069
HAD ACROSS THE VARIOUS I AM A

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:15.270

WOULD KNOW THAT THOSE THAT BACK

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.478
AND FORTH ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.080
PUBLIC AND SO.

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:26.147
FOR THE PUBLIC TRYING TO FOLLOW

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:28.049
LONGER FOLKS TRYING TO TO LOOK

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:32.954
ONCE ONCE THIS IS DONE.

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.589
AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:35.991
HAVE SOME OF THAT DETAIL IN

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.325
INFORMATION AND THAT'S ALWAYS

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.327
HELPFUL IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.229
WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK TO GET

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:43.598
THE QUESTIONS ANSWERED ON THE C. --

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.000
ONE THIRTY TANKERS --

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:45.900
WHAT WERE TALKING ADAM

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:47.869
INCREASING TO TENS OF MILLIONS

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.704
OF DOLLARS IN OUT YOUR COSTS

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:50.272
WHILE THESE PLANES WOULD BE

PROVIDED --

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:52.507
FOR FREE BY THE FEDERAL

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.944
SIGNIFICANT ON MAINTENANCE AND

01:21:56.011 --> 01:22:00.482
OPERATIONAL COSTS --

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:01.116
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THOSE

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:03.918
COSTS ALL IS THAT THE

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.287
LEGISLATURE RECEIVED AND THAT

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:06.688
THERE COULD BE A POTENTIAL

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.290
ADDITIONAL COSTS BEYOND THAT AND

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.824
SO WILL CONTINUE WORKING

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:11.359
HOPEFULLY THE NEXT TIME THIS

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.161
COMES UP ON THIS WILL HAVE MORE

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:14.562

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF DETAIL I'M

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:41.690

WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THIS

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.996
BETTER BUT NOTED FROM THE AGENDA --

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:50.298
THAT THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:52.400
REQUIRE CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE AN

OPERATIONAL NEEDS THAT IS A

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:05.246
FAIRLY SHORT TIME LINE

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.649
SPECIFICALLY AS WE KNOW FIRE

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:09.684
THEIR FIRE ACTIVITY IS GOING TO

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:11.086
BE RAMPING UP AND WILL CARRY

THROUGH DECEMBER INTO THAT JUST

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.122
DOESN'T SEEM.

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:16.091
LIKE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:17.759

LAST YEAR THOSE IN A INCREASED

01:30:04.465 --> 01:30:06.067
CAPABILITIES BUT THESE.

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:08.169
THE CCC CREWS ARE BACK FILLING

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:11.072
SOME OF OUR OUR CREWS THAT ARE

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:15.009
STARTING TO DUE TO LACK OF

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.444
INMATES --

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:18.379
AND THEN --

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:21.015
THE THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:22.450
IN HERE --

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:24.285
THOSE ARE AS A SWEET --

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:27.021
THEY'RE GETTING US TO WEAR OR WE

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:29.624
CAN REALLY MOVE FORWARD THIS

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.392
YEAR WITH A WITH A BETTER

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:33.127
RESOURCE TO DO SO --

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:36.063
AS FAR AS IF WE COULD DO MORE A

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:37.665
MINUTE TAKE YOUR YOUR SECOND

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:38.266
WILL.

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:40.468
COULD WE GET TO MORE THIS THIS --

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:41.936
THIS YEAR --

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:44.939
IF WE COULD DO MORE I WOULD SAY --

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.841
THERE IS PROBABLY.

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:49.343
MORE THAT WE COULD DO --

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.245
IT WOULD BE A TALL ORDER TO DO

01:30:51.312 --> 01:30:53.781
MORE THAN THE THIRTEEN I BECAUSE

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:54.816
OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RATE

01:30:54.882 --> 01:30:56.684
RAISED RELATED --

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.019
TO PURCHASING THE EQUIPMENT AS

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.692
TO OPERATE THAT EQUIPMENT.

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:06.794
AND PERMANENT AND HAVE THEM AS

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:09.330
PERMANENT EMPLOYEES --

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:12.300
BUT THE THE SUITE THAT WE HAVE --

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:13.935
IN FRONT OF US AND AND WE'RE

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:14.836
PRESENTING --

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:17.338
THROUGH THIS BUDGET IS IS --

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:21.409
KIND OF WHERE WE FEEL IS IS IS A

01:31:21.475 --> 01:31:24.745
NO REGRETS ASK AND THIS IS WHERE

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:27.048
WE WE ARE CURRENTLY --

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:32.520
RELATED --

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:33.154
TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVENTY FIVE

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:34.689
I I II -- I

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.724
UNDERSTAND THAT AND THE AND I

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.826
CAN'T DISAGREE THAT IN IN OUR

01:31:38.893 --> 01:31:41.329
MATH WE HAVE --

01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:42.864
TWENTY THREE LESS ENGINES THAN

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:44.565
WE DID AT THAT POINT TIME --

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:45.933
WE ACTUALLY HAVE LESS --

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.569
EMPLOYEES ON ENGINES BUT THAT

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:49.971
WAS A VERY SEASONAL FIRE

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:51.739

WHAT THE BALANCE IS BETWEEN

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:01.215
PERMANENT YEAR ROUND FIRE

NEEDS THESE THIRTEEN WILL ADD TO

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:08.756
OUR PEAK NEEDS --

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:11.325
WHERE BACK IN IN THE IN THE

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:14.962

BUT THERE IS NO BETTER TOOL TO

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:39.654
BE ABLE TO SOLVE WHAT I WILL

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.722
CALL CRISIS WITHIN THE RANKS OF

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:43.190

[inaudible]

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:11.285
AND BOTTOM LINE IS WE CAN.

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:12.920
ADVANCE WHICH WE SHOULD IN IS

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.288

I'M GONNA GO BACK TO TWO

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:21.362
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE STARTED

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.064
THE ANALYSIS ALREADY WITH THE

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:26.467

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:35.743
THIRTY OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:37.211
NOT KEEPING UP WITH A SEVERITY

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:39.347
FIRES THAT WE HAVE CAL FIRES

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:40.581
UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE

01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:42.049
SEVERITY FIRES THAT WE HAVE.

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:43.551
IN THE BEST TOOL THAT WE HAVE TO

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:46.287
BE ABLE TO COMBAT THE CRISIS

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:48.089
WHEN IT COMES TO MIDDLE HEALTH.

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:51.125
WITH FIREFIGHTERS BEING GONE TWO

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:52.360
THREE FOUR MONTHS AT A TIME IT'S

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:53.995
GETTING MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.096
AND WE CAN'T COMPARE THE

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:58.632
CONDITIONS HE'S THE CONDITIONS

01:33:58.699 --> 01:33:59.667
THAT WE HAVE HERE.

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:01.002
I KNOW I'M PREACHING THE CHOIR

01:34:01.068 --> 01:34:03.904

THE BULLET AND MAKE THE

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.142
INVESTMENT --

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:10.344
AND LONG TERM IF WE TAKE A LOOK

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:11.812
AT THE INSURED LOSSES THAT WE'VE

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.848
HAD OVER TWELVE BILLION.

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:16.150
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE A I

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:17.918
GREW TO CHAIR WE NEED TO BE ABLE

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:20.221
PREVENTION.

ON GETTING ADDITIONAL FOLKS ON

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:41.936

MORE EMPLOYEES FOR THE ENGINES

01:35:58.652 --> 01:35:59.854
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE BECAUSE

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.155
WERE STAFFED AT A DIFFERENT

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:03.190
LEVEL THAT WE WERE --

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:06.861

WE BELIEVE THAT --

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.688
THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS AS A

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.524
STANDALONE IT WAS IT WAS PUT

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:38.225

CONCERNS THAT THAT --

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:51.172
THAT IF WE DID SOMETHING UNDER

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:53.574
THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION OF OF

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.809

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:56.377
TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S

01:36:56.443 --> 01:36:57.344
THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT LONG

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:58.245
ENOUGH FOR US TO DO WHAT WE

01:36:58.312 --> 01:37:00.281
ACTUALLY NEED TO DO FOR ALL OF

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:01.615
THIS WE CAN DO FIRE ENGINES UP

01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:03.651
FRONT BUT IT'S A WHOLE SYSTEM AS

IT SHOULDN'T BE EITHER OR RIGHT

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:56.490
NOW.

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:57.758
AND THAT WERE UNDER SIZING THIS

01:39:57.825 --> 01:40:01.028
ENTIRE --

01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:02.363
PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET AND I

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:03.597

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:04.832
DECISIONS.

01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:05.899
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:13.841
CONSEQUENCES OF OF OF DOING LESS.

01:40:13.907 --> 01:40:17.077
THEY HAVE REAL HUMAN IMPACT --

01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:19.580

01:40:19.646 --> 01:40:21.148
THE MEN AND WOMEN WITHIN YOUR

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:23.684
RANKS WHICH I THINK WE ALL

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:25.753
STRUGGLE WITH.

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:28.589
THIS JARRING STATISTICS ABOUT.

01:40:28.655 --> 01:40:31.024
IN A SUICIDE RATES OUTPACING

MINA DUTY DEATH RIGHT NOW ON THE

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:34.561
FRONT LINES --

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:37.564
SOBERING --

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:40.734
SO MY I ACTUALLY APPRECIATED.

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:42.403
THE LA OWES.

01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:44.338
COMMENDATION WHICH WE TALKED

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:44.938
ABOUT A BROADER BUDGET HEARING

01:40:45.005 --> 01:40:47.608
ABOUT.

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.376
CONDUCTING AN ASSESSMENT TO IT --

01:40:49.443 --> 01:40:51.078
INFORM FUTURE BUDGET DECISION.

01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:51.712
I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S A

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:52.846
CRITICISM I THINK THAT'S A

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:53.547
THAT'S A CALL FOR MORE

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:55.349
CREATIVITY IN A LITTLE BIT

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.151
BIGGER THINKING HERE ABOUT.

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:58.619
WHERE DO WE END UP?

01:40:58.685 --> 01:40:59.887
YOU KNOW WE GO YEAR TO YEAR ON

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:01.422
WITHIN G. G. R. F. AND HAVE TO

01:41:01.488 --> 01:41:03.991
SORT OF FIGHT WITHIN THIS POT

01:41:04.057 --> 01:41:05.359
THAT.

01:41:05.426 --> 01:41:06.827
I DON'T THINK SHOULD BE THIS

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:08.061
THIS SMALL AND I THINK IT'S A

01:41:08.128 --> 01:41:09.329
LITTLE ARBITRARY I THINK WE

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:10.497
SHOULD ASSESS.

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:12.399
THE ACTUAL SCOPE OF THE NEED IT

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:14.468
MAY INCLUDE A C. ONE THIRTY AND

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:16.103
IT MAY INCLUDE BEEFED UP MENTAL

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:17.838
HEALTH AND IT MAY INCLUDE MORE

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:18.972
ENGINES IT IS.

01:41:19.039 --> 01:41:20.741
I ACTUALLY THINK MORE IS JUST

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:23.677
GOING TO BE THE ANSWER SO --

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.612
BUT WE HAVE TO KNOW NEED SO I I

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:27.714
WOULD I I APPRECIATE THAT POINT

01:41:27.781 --> 01:41:28.315
I HOPE I HOPE WE DO GET THERE

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:29.516
WERE.

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:32.453
WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND.

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:33.954
REALLY TRY TO EXPEDITE FUEL

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:35.355
MANAGEMENT DOING YOUR JOB

01:41:35.422 --> 01:41:36.690
THINKING AHEAD AND TRYING TO

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:38.025
COME UP WITH A STRATEGIC PLAN

01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.526
FOR THIS TRUCK OF THE BUDGET I

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:41.094
SEE NO REASON WHY IT SHOULD HAVE

01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:42.296
THE SAME STANDING AS ARE OTHER

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:43.897
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED ITEMS

01:41:43.964 --> 01:41:45.332
WITHIN THE G. G. R. F..

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:46.700
OR WE'RE LOOKING AT TRANSIT

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:47.935
INVESTMENTS --

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:49.570
THIS IS ALSO A LONG TERM

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:50.971
INVESTMENT AND PEOPLE ARE

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:57.611
AT A HIGH LEVEL.

01:41:57.678 --> 01:41:59.646

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:05.285
THE HUNGER.

FOR YET JUST NOT NOT UNDER

01:42:08.121 --> 01:42:10.157

BIT BEFORE WE GET THROUGH THIS

VERY METHODICAL COURSE --

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:13.687

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:22.642
THEY REQUIRE SAYS.

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:23.710
BEST THING WE DO IS ACTUALLY I

01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:25.178
CAPACITY COULDN'T AGREE MORE

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:28.048
RIGHT LESS STRESS OVERSTRETCHED.

OF FIREFIGHTERS ONLINE IT'S

01:46:29.316 --> 01:46:31.651
GOING TO LEAD TO HEALTHIER

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:35.055
HAPPIER FOLKS BUT IF I SEND IT

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:36.256
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SORT OF A THE

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:36.857
PUSH AND PULL OF SORT OF THAT

01:46:36.923 --> 01:46:37.791
OVERALL WELLNESS PROGRAM AND

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.526
THEN WHEN THINGS REALLY DO GET

01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:41.161
BAD HAD ACTUALLY UTILIZE IF YOU

AND INJURIES ARE JUST TO THE

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:46.600
BODY RIGHT THERE.

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:46.900
THAT.

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:50.170
YOU KNOW PSI'S IS ISRAEL --

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.171

DO YOU HOW DO YOU SORT OF SIZE

01:46:53.039 --> 01:46:53.774
THAT UP I SAW AN INCREASE

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.342
DEALING WITH A FEW WORKERS COMP

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:56.810
RELATED --

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:59.112
DISABILITY INDUSTRIAL DISABILITY

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:00.814
LEAVE -- HOW

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:02.482
DO YOU DO YOU DO YOU SEE UP TICK

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:03.950
COMING IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF?

01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:05.252
CLAIMS BEING FILED ON THAT FRONT

01:47:05.318 --> 01:47:06.186
I KNOW YOU TRY TO MITIGATE THAT

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.188
WITH THAT SORT OF BROADER

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:08.822
WELLNESS BUT CAN YOU COMMENT ON

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:09.856
THAT.

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:10.490
HI.

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:14.427
I DO SEE AN UPTICK IN WHAT I

01:47:14.494 --> 01:47:16.196
DON'T HAVE STATISTICS SHOW THAT --

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:19.032
BUT ANECDOTALLY I'M SEEING THAT

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:21.802
AND IS AS WELL AS I DO BELIEVE

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:24.104
THAT THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO

01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:25.138
REDUCE THAT.

01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:26.740
IN THE FUTURE IT'S GOING TO BE

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:28.842
DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY --

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:30.644
BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:32.479
ABLE -- TO

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:37.918
SAVE PEOPLE.

01:47:37.984 --> 01:47:39.486
KEEP THEM OUT OF THAT WORKERS

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:40.787
COMP.

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:42.255
A SITUATION KEEP THEM --

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:44.291
AS PRODUCTIVE --

01:47:44.357 --> 01:47:46.026
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHICH WE

01:47:46.092 --> 01:47:48.495
ALL NEED --

01:47:48.562 --> 01:47:50.997
AND SO OF BAD THAT'S KIND OF

01:47:51.064 --> 01:47:52.365
THAT THAT'S WHERE I AM AYE AYE

01:47:52.432 --> 01:47:55.001
AYE IT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:47:55.068 --> 01:47:56.536
DIRECTLY RELATED TO A IT'S

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:57.938
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT DIRECTLY

01:47:58.004 --> 01:47:59.840
RELATED TO THE OTHER ITEM IN

01:47:59.906 --> 01:48:02.843
HERE ABOUT THE INDUSTRY

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:05.745

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:10.517
COMEDY ODD.

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:12.252
THE THE IDEA OF THE ENHANCE

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:14.588

01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:46.279
DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE CAMERAS

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:48.615
THAT WE NEED CAMERAS --

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:50.350

HAZARDOUS WASTE WE HAVE SENSORS

01:51:13.266 --> 01:51:14.601
FOR AIR QUALITY WE HAVE WE HAVE

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:16.469
WEATHER STATIONS WE HAVE ALL

IT'S A GOOD ONE THAT MADE NEED

01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:46.633
TO BE AUGMENTED AS WE GO WHEN

01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:48.101
THEY'RE IN AS WE LOOK AT OUR

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:49.569

TO INSTALLATIONS ARE DIFFERENCE

01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:51.231
ARE INSTALLED AND AND SO WE WANT

01:52:51.297 --> 01:52:53.299
TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING

01:52:57.103 --> 01:52:59.405
THAT'S CORRECT IN IS THAT.

01:52:59.472 --> 01:53:00.840
OPERATION MAINTENANCE IS THAT

01:53:06.746 --> 01:53:07.981
SO BROADLY SPEAKING THERE'S A

01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:10.750
COUPLE OF COMPONENTS WITH IT NOT

01:53:10.817 --> 01:53:12.218
FIFTY MILLION SO THERE'S AND

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:13.653
THAT SORT OF THE COSTS OF OF

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:14.854
OPERATING THE ACTUAL PLANES

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:16.756
THEMSELVES AND THAT COMES DOWN

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:18.291
TO COSTS FOR PILOTS.

01:53:18.358 --> 01:53:23.663
I'M AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT IT AS

01:53:23.730 --> 01:53:24.764

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:56.229
CAPACITY WITHIN THE PROGRAM IN

01:53:56.296 --> 01:53:57.664
NONE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:58.198

01:53:58.264 --> 01:54:00.433
DOLLARS IN THE CREWS THAT ARE

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:04.737
BEING PROPOSED AND THIS IS IN

01:54:04.804 --> 01:54:05.772
THE WORLD DEAL WITH IN A BIT BUT

01:54:05.838 --> 01:54:07.273
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO.

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.541
WITH ANY --

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:09.175
PREPARING HIS HE WENT THIRTIES

THAT THIRTEEN MILLION IS

01:54:09.909 --> 01:54:14.047
STRICTLY FOR THOSE NEW AIRPLANES.

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:16.716
YES IT IS YEAH I'VE I'M JUST CAN

01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:18.785

WHICH I DO MAYES --

01:54:22.722 --> 01:54:24.791
PROPOSING THIS FACILITIES ARE

01:54:24.857 --> 01:54:25.558
PARA MAINTENANCE --

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:26.192
I WOULD SAY THAT THE PROBABLY

01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:27.827
THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:28.928
AT AT TELL FARES --

01:54:28.995 --> 01:54:32.232
TECH PIECES MORE BROADLY ARE

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:34.601
SORT OF IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:37.403
FACILITIES EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF

01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:37.937
WHERE THOSE DOLLARS TO BE

01:54:38.004 --> 01:54:39.372
DEDICATED.

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:40.607
RELATED TO THAT THIS THIS IS

01:54:40.673 --> 01:54:42.842
SPECIFIC TO THE C. ONE THIRTIES

01:54:42.909 --> 01:54:43.843
THIS REQUEST --

01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:46.579
WE WERE NOT RAPPING AND OTHER --

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:47.180
SPECIAL REPAIRS THAT WE MIGHT

01:54:47.247 --> 01:54:48.648
NEED -- AND

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:49.749
BUT THERE ARE --

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:51.050
MODIFICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE

01:54:51.117 --> 01:54:52.352
MADE.

01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:53.319
RELATED --

01:54:53.386 --> 01:54:55.288
TO PILOTS QUARTERS NEEDED FOR

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:56.956
HAVING THREE INDIVIDUALS A CREW

01:54:57.023 --> 01:54:59.225
OF THREE IT'S ONE PILOT AND AND

01:54:59.292 --> 01:55:00.793
THEN AND THEN ALSO --

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.462
SOME OF THE RAMP SPACE AND

01:55:02.528 --> 01:55:03.630
THINGS NEED TO BE EXPANDED

01:55:03.696 --> 01:55:04.831
BECAUSE IT'S A MUCH BIGGER

01:55:04.897 --> 01:55:06.833
AIRCRAFT AND AND JUST

01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:08.067
MANEUVERING IT AROUND --

01:55:08.134 --> 01:55:10.370
REQUIRES MORE SPACE AND SO

01:55:10.436 --> 01:55:13.473
THERE'S THOSE KIND OF COSTS FOR

01:55:13.539 --> 01:55:15.608
UTILIZING THIS TYPE OF AIR

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:16.576
TANKER.

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:18.044
IN THE FUTURE OF THIS INDEED

01:55:18.111 --> 01:55:21.180
HERE IN THIRTY SECONDS AND QUICK

01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:22.382

GENERAL IS THAT LOOK.

01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:24.384
I THINK MY BOTTOM LINE IS

01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:25.618
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S UP TO

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:26.252
LEGISLATURE NOW TO BE A C. FOR

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:27.220
GOING TO BE ABLE.

01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:28.154

01:55:31.791 --> 01:55:33.426
GOVERNOR.

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:34.327
AND I DO NOT THINK WE NEED A

STEP.

01:55:35.862 --> 01:55:37.530
YOU BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT WE

01:55:37.597 --> 01:55:38.965

ON ENGINES.

01:55:42.035 --> 01:55:42.635
I THINK WITH THAT SAID YOU SHOW

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:43.970
US IS.

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:45.471
HOW SHORT WE ARE?

01:55:45.538 --> 01:55:46.873
SO -- AND I

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:48.808
CANNOT IMAGINE THAT A STUDIES

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:51.844
GONNA COME BACK SAYING THAT WE

01:55:51.911 --> 01:55:52.745
ARE -- JUST

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.714
TWENTY THREE SHORT.

UP.

01:56:03.156 --> 01:56:04.357
THAT'S WHY  THINK THAT WE NEED

01:56:04.424 --> 01:56:06.392
TO BE ABLE TO GO FURTHER ON TOP

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:08.528
OF AGAIN THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM

01:56:08.594 --> 01:56:11.331

02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:06.906
FACILITY?

02:04:06.972 --> 02:04:09.809
THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION AND

02:04:09.875 --> 02:04:12.978
THESE ARE PUBLIC FACILITIES AND

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:15.581

BUT IN MY UPBRINGING I I

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:18.884
REMEMBER.

02:04:18.951 --> 02:04:21.620
A TIME WHEN --

02:04:21.687 --> 02:04:24.023

OTHER WAY TO ADDRESS IT WOULD BE

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:39.031
BY PUTTING IN A ONE TIME FINDS

02:10:39.097 --> 02:10:40.532

CAL FIRE WOULD GET SIX MILLION

02:10:55.514 --> 02:10:56.949
DOLLARS FROM THAT SO THAT'S

02:10:57.015 --> 02:10:58.483
GOING TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT

02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:59.985
BACKLOG THAT'S ACCUMULATED.

02:11:00.052 --> 02:11:01.153
THIS PROPOSAL --

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.154
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:03.188
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:05.357
REALLY PREVENT THE BACKLOG FROM.

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.459
I AM IN NO CONTINUING TO GROW IN

02:11:07.526 --> 02:11:09.161
THE FUTURE I WOULD HIGHLIGHT I'M

02:11:09.228 --> 02:11:10.395
ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

02:11:10.462 --> 02:11:11.396
PROPOSAL THAT ISN'T ON THE

02:11:11.463 --> 02:11:13.498
AGENDA FOR TODAY BUT WE DO HAVE

02:11:13.565 --> 02:11:15.234
A RECOMMENDATION THERE --

02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:16.401
TO ENSURE THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE

02:11:16.468 --> 02:11:17.769
REPORTING BACK ON WHAT'S

02:11:17.836 --> 02:11:19.238
HAPPENING TO THE SIZE OF THEIR

02:11:19.304 --> 02:11:20.639
BACKLOG AS WELL AS HOW THEY'RE

02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:21.707
SPENDING THESE OF THE OTHER ONE

02:11:21.773 --> 02:11:23.375
TIME FUNDS WHICH IS A SEPARATE

02:11:23.442 --> 02:11:24.843
PROPOSAL.

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:25.911
AND AND IT JUST THAT KIND OF

02:11:25.978 --> 02:11:27.312
INFORMATION WILL BE IMPORTANT

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:28.480
FOR YOU TO EVALUATE NOT ONLY

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:30.048
THAT PROPOSAL BUT THESE SORTS OF

02:11:30.115 --> 02:11:31.450
PROPOSALS WHERE.

02:11:31.516 --> 02:11:32.150
ARE THEY REALLY MEETING THE

02:11:32.217 --> 02:11:33.552
GOALS AT OF STOPPING THE

02:11:33.619 --> 02:11:35.554
INCREASE IN THE GROWTH OF THE

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:37.022
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND

02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:38.991
WHICH WOULD BE SORT OF THE GOAL

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:40.158
OF THIS TYPE OF A PROPOSAL.

02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:41.426
THIS SORT OF THING IS SOMETHING

02:11:41.493 --> 02:11:42.928
THAT OUR OFFICE HAS RECOMMENDED

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:45.197
THAT DEPARTMENTS DUE TO INCREASE

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:47.032
THEIR ON GOING FUNDING FOR IT

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:47.766
FOR FACILITIES MAINTENANCE SO

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:48.567
THAT.

02:11:48.634 --> 02:11:49.801
YOU DON'T END UP WITH A BACKLOG

02:11:49.868 --> 02:11:51.503
WHICH ENDS UP BEING MUCH MORE

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:54.439
COSTLY AND CAN LEAD. TO TURN THE

02:11:54.506 --> 02:11:58.744
SCENE -- NO

02:11:58.810 --> 02:11:59.344
IT'S NO LONGER MAINTENANCE NOW

02:11:59.411 --> 02:12:01.480
YOU HAVE TO DO MARX AND X.

02:12:01.546 --> 02:12:03.615
UNDERSTANDING AS A LOT OF THIS

02:12:03.682 --> 02:12:06.184
WORK IS AND YET NOT NOT THAT IT

02:12:06.251 --> 02:12:07.719
WOULD NECESSARILY EXCLUDE EIGHTY

02:12:07.786 --> 02:12:08.787
EIGHT WORK BUT A LOT OF IT WOULD

02:12:08.854 --> 02:12:10.222
BE AND YOU KNOW EACH BACK

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:12.858
REPAIRS AND ROOF REPAIRS AND AND

02:12:12.924 --> 02:12:13.425
JUST.

02:12:13.492 --> 02:12:15.327
GENERAL CONDITION OF THE

02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:16.495
FACILITIES.

02:12:16.561 --> 02:12:18.497
AND AND THAT THAT WOULD GO

02:12:18.563 --> 02:12:20.299
BEYOND THAT AND THAT THERE'S A

02:12:20.365 --> 02:12:22.467
LOT OF THOUGHT ACCUMULATED WORK.

02:12:22.534 --> 02:12:23.068
SURE I I ONLY WENT OUT IS IS

02:12:23.135 --> 02:12:25.203
THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY AT

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:26.638
EVEN TO ADDRESS THE IN ANY

02:12:26.705 --> 02:12:28.507
GROWTH IN THE IN THE BACKLOG IN

02:12:28.573 --> 02:12:30.008
THE FUTURE SO IT'S PUTTING IN

02:12:30.075 --> 02:12:30.976
THAT ONGOING MAINTENANCE FUNDING

02:12:31.043 --> 02:12:35.113
SO THAT TELL FIRES IN A POSITION

02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:36.214
TO DEAL WITH SORT OF THIS.

H. BACK BUT ALSO.

02:12:50.429 --> 02:12:52.164
MAKE SOME ELECTRICAL WORK IN --

02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:54.499
ON THE ENERGY SIDE OF YOUR

02:12:54.566 --> 02:12:56.368
SYSTEMS I KNOW.

02:12:56.435 --> 02:12:58.704
YOUR NOT A IMMUNE FROM AG THE

02:12:58.770 --> 02:12:59.771
GREAT ISSUES WE'VE BEEN HAVING

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:02.474
IN WE LOSE POWER PEOPLE GET HURT --

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:05.177
I I'M WONDERING HOW YOU'RE

APPROACHING.

02:13:06.978 --> 02:13:08.480
THAT ISSUE THE RESILIENCY OF

02:13:08.547 --> 02:13:09.981
YOUR FACILITIES --

02:13:10.048 --> 02:13:12.217
IT IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT KIND OF

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:12.784
PROJECTS WE COULD SEE GOING

02:13:12.851 --> 02:13:14.553
FORWARD.

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:16.722
IF I MIGHT ADD --

02:13:16.788 --> 02:13:18.490
NEAR THE ABILITY.

02:13:18.557 --> 02:13:19.591
FOR CAL FIRE AND FRANKLY ALL

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:21.126
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND

02:13:21.193 --> 02:13:22.561
THE STATE THAT HAVE CRUCIAL

02:13:22.627 --> 02:13:25.397
PUBLIC SERVICE NEEDS TO BE ABLE

02:13:25.464 --> 02:13:27.366
TO SURVIVE OFF CREATED. FOR DAYS

02:13:27.432 --> 02:13:28.934
ON END POTENTIALLY DURING THE

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:29.568
CYCLES.

02:13:29.634 --> 02:13:33.772
THIS IS A MAJOR PRAYER.

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:35.140
WHAT'S THAT IS THAT MISSION A

02:13:35.207 --> 02:13:37.042
PART OF HOW YOU ALL ARE GOING TO

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:40.612
BE UNDERTAKING THIS MAINTENANCE

02:13:40.679 --> 02:13:42.447
SERVER UPGRADE EFFORT.

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:43.348
COMMENTS.

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:44.149
BOB I WOULD SAY WE TAKE.

02:13:44.216 --> 02:13:45.417
TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

02:13:45.484 --> 02:13:46.985
SITUATION --

02:13:47.052 --> 02:13:48.587
WHENEVER WE CAN AND I'LL GIVE AN

02:13:48.653 --> 02:13:49.955
EXAMPLE --

02:13:50.021 --> 02:13:52.958
CHP WAS SURPLUS SING GENERATORS

02:13:53.024 --> 02:13:54.126
THEY BOUGHT TWO FOR EACH OF

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:56.261
THEIR FACILITIES --

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:57.796
ONE WAS A SPARE --

02:13:57.863 --> 02:13:59.264
THEY FOUND THAT THEY DIDN'T USE

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:00.665
THEM FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS SO

02:14:00.732 --> 02:14:03.001
THEY SURPLUS THEM SO WE WENT AND

02:14:03.068 --> 02:14:05.303
AND GATHERS MANY AS WE COULD SO

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:06.238
WE CAN PUT HIM AT FIRE STATIONS

02:14:06.304 --> 02:14:07.072
THE MAJORITY OF OUR FIRE

02:14:07.139 --> 02:14:08.473
STATIONS ARE NOT.

02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:11.076
GENERATOR SUPPORTED SO ALL THE

02:14:11.143 --> 02:14:12.544
NEW CAPITAL PROJECTS ARE --

02:14:12.611 --> 02:14:15.180
MOST OF OUR FACILITIES WERE BILL

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:19.751
PRIOR TO NINETEEN SIXTY SO --

02:14:19.818 --> 02:14:22.621
WHAT HOW WE REMAIN OP NO POWER

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:24.689
TO THE SITE BUT THERE'S POWER TO

02:14:24.756 --> 02:14:25.357
THE RADIOS AS FAR AS IN THE

02:14:25.424 --> 02:14:27.092
ENGINES --

02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:28.693
SO WE CAN STILL.

02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:30.629
MAIN CONTACT ON THAT AND IN ANY

02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:32.631
WAY POSSIBLE THEN WE'LL GO TO

02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:34.466
TEMPORARILY SET UP A GENERATOR.

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.435
I AND WE DO THAT AT THE CAMPFIRE --

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:39.471
AS WELL AND WE ALSO IDENTIFIED

02:14:39.538 --> 02:14:41.106
SUPPORT FUNDS --

02:14:41.173 --> 02:14:42.474
FOR I BELIEVE TWO STATIONS TO

02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:45.043
NOW HAVE GENERATORS UP IN

02:14:45.110 --> 02:14:46.077
PARADISE --

02:14:46.144 --> 02:14:47.913
I THE PARADISE AREA --

02:14:47.979 --> 02:14:49.314
SO YES THAT WERE TRYING TO

02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:50.782
NIBBLE AWAY AS BEST WE CAN

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:52.150
BECAUSE WE REALIZE WHAT OUR

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:53.919
RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:14:53.985 --> 02:14:54.953
I WOULD JUST ADD THOUGH MY

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.621
CONCERNS WE WENT THROUGH THIS

02:14:56.688 --> 02:14:58.657
THIS GENERATOR GAME.

02:14:58.723 --> 02:15:01.226
DOWN AND WE'LL SEE.

02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:03.195
FEEL THE PAIN IT TOO YOU'VE GOT

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:03.762
TO STOCKPILE FUEL.

02:15:03.829 --> 02:15:04.896
I'M WINNER WHEN WE GET PAST THIS

02:15:04.963 --> 02:15:06.998
DIESEL GENERATOR CHASING THE

02:15:07.065 --> 02:15:08.166
FUEL AND TRY TO GET THAN FUEL

02:15:08.233 --> 02:15:10.635
PASSED FIRE LINES AND BLOCKAGES

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:11.937
WE WE WE LITERALLY HAD T HAVE.

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:13.605
ENTIRE FUEL CONVOYS TRY TO FEED

02:15:13.672 --> 02:15:15.640
THEM THE GENERATOR BUT THE FIRES

02:15:15.707 --> 02:15:17.108
GOING AND THEN THERE'S BLOCKADES

02:15:17.175 --> 02:15:17.676
IN.

02:15:17.742 --> 02:15:18.944
AND I WENT WHY AREN'T WE

02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:21.146
REALIZING THE CLEAN ENERGY

02:15:21.213 --> 02:15:22.280
POTENTIAL AT ALL THESE

02:15:22.347 --> 02:15:23.915
FACILITIES IN TRYING TO GET

02:15:23.982 --> 02:15:25.650
OURSELVES GRADE RESILIENT.

02:15:25.717 --> 02:15:27.352
GOING TO BATTERY BACK UP LOOKING

02:15:27.419 --> 02:15:29.120
AT MY GROUP GRADES YOU KNOW ON

02:15:29.187 --> 02:15:31.923
SITE GENERATION THAT'S NOT GOING.

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:34.326
TO LIKE REQUIRE BUDGET DIESEL OR

02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:35.660
PROPANE TO GET SHIPPED IN IS

02:15:35.727 --> 02:15:37.229
THAT IS THAT SOME YOU'RE

02:15:37.295 --> 02:15:37.762
THINKING ABOUT --

02:15:37.829 --> 02:15:40.599
DEFINITELY --

02:15:40.665 --> 02:15:44.302
ACTUALLY DEPARTMENT WELL --

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:45.871
TRAINED AND THE WASTER --

02:15:45.937 --> 02:15:47.639
THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT OUR REMOTE

02:15:47.706 --> 02:15:49.808
LOCATIONS AS FAR AS CAMPS AND

02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:51.776
AND I'D SAY TO A LESSER EXTENT

02:15:51.843 --> 02:15:52.878
STATE FORCE.

02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:54.246
FOR A DEVELOPING --

02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:56.915
POWER OUT REMOTE AREAS TO TO

02:15:56.982 --> 02:15:58.183
ASSIST US --

02:15:58.250 --> 02:16:00.218
MOSTLY -- WE

02:16:00.285 --> 02:16:01.853
HAVE ONE FIRE STATION TECHNICAL

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:03.355
SERVICES --

02:16:03.421 --> 02:16:06.324
MY UNIT OUT OF READING --

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:08.093
PUT UP --

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:12.831
SOLAR AT AT THE FIRE STATION

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:14.132
JUST OUTSIDE READING.

02:16:14.199 --> 02:16:15.133
WE'RE TRYING TO COMBAT THAT

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:15.667
BECAUSE WE DO REALIZE IT

02:16:15.734 --> 02:16:16.935
SOMETIMES WERE WITHOUT POWER

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:19.004
RESOURCES WATER EVEN --

02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:20.338
FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME

02:16:20.405 --> 02:16:21.973
SO WE DO HAVE --

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:22.207
LARGE --

02:16:22.274 --> 02:16:25.377
STORY FUEL --

02:16:25.443 --> 02:16:26.144
THAT'S PRIMARILY FOR THE

02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:28.246
APPARATUS BUT WE CAN ALSO USE

02:16:28.313 --> 02:16:29.447
THAT FOR GENERATORS AND AIR

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:31.216
RESOURCES BOARD SOMETIMES WILL

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:32.517
NOT PERMIT THAT SO.

02:16:32.584 --> 02:16:35.287
WE'VE LOOK AT PROPANE --

02:16:35.353 --> 02:16:36.922
WE HAVE.

02:16:36.988 --> 02:16:37.923
TO I'LL ACTUALLY HAVE TO FIRE

02:16:37.989 --> 02:16:39.024
STATIONS --

02:16:39.090 --> 02:16:40.191
OR ACTUALLY IT'S A COMBINATION

02:16:40.258 --> 02:16:42.027
OF THREE AND THE THE CURRENT

02:16:42.093 --> 02:16:44.462
BUDGET THAT ARE OFF GRID --

02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:46.698
WILBUR SPRINGS HAMID ARE PERMITS

02:16:46.765 --> 02:16:50.302
SPRINGS AND SKULL CREEK THAT ARE

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:50.936
COMBINATIONS.

02:16:51.002 --> 02:16:52.103
WHICH THEY DO HAVE A SMALL

02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:53.972
GENERATOR BUT ITS BATTERY BACKUP

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:55.540
INSULAR.

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:57.475
SO THE ONE THEY'RE JUST ASK IS

02:16:57.542 --> 02:16:59.477
TO LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ALL AND

02:16:59.544 --> 02:17:01.246
PARTNERING TO GET CREATIVE ABOUT

02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:03.848
HOW TO MAKE THIS MONEY GO AS FAR

02:17:03.915 --> 02:17:04.149
AS WE CAN.

02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:06.251
BUT THERE IS IN A CREATIVE PPA

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:07.686
WHERE YOU GUYS ARE ABLE.

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:09.421
TO PULL PURCHASE CLEAN BACKUP

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:11.356
POWER EVEN MICRO GREENS FOR YOUR

02:23:37.842 --> 02:23:39.043
WHETHER IT WAS INDUSTRY THAT WAS

02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:41.245
BALKING AT IT BECAUSE THEY SELL

02:23:41.312 --> 02:23:42.747
SAFE AND SANE FIREWORKS IN THE

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:44.048
STATE AND THEY WERE GOING TO BE

02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:45.450
ASKED TO SUBSIDIZE ALL OF THE

02:23:45.516 --> 02:23:47.018
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY THAT WAS

02:23:47.085 --> 02:23:49.220
OCCURRING --

02:23:49.287 --> 02:23:52.023
AND THEIR CONCERNS WERE THE

02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:53.391
PRODUCTS THAT WERE BEING SEASON

02:23:53.458 --> 02:23:54.625
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'D BE ABLE TO

02:23:54.692 --> 02:23:56.027
SPEAK TO RESELL THEM.

02:23:56.094 --> 02:23:58.196
IN ANOTHER LOCATION AND RECOUP

02:23:58.262 --> 02:24:01.866
THEIR COST OR OR ABSORB SOME

02:24:01.933 --> 02:24:03.234
LIABILITY BECAUSE OF THAT.

02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:04.869
SO WE WORKED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:08.339
CYCLES TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A

02:24:08.406 --> 02:24:10.008
MODEL AND WE JUST COULD NEVER

02:24:10.074 --> 02:24:11.009
GET IT THROUGH.

02:24:11.075 --> 02:24:12.877
THE LEGISLATURE AS I RECALL IT

02:24:12.944 --> 02:24:14.245
ALSO EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN

02:24:14.312 --> 02:24:16.481
ABOUT RE PURPOSING OF OF THE

02:24:16.547 --> 02:24:18.449

02:24:23.388 --> 02:24:24.422
ATTEMPT.

WITH THIS --

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.796
PROPOSAL I IT SEEMS REASONABLE

02:24:31.863 --> 02:24:34.265
AND WE JUST KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T.

02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:35.700
FOR CLOSE THE OPTION FOR THE

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:38.236
LEGISLATURE AT A FUTURE TIME IF

02:24:38.302 --> 02:24:39.604
YOU DO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.205
FUNDING MECHANISM MORE OR WAY OF

02:24:41.272 --> 02:24:42.540
HANDLING THIS SO YOU COULD

02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:44.942
ALWAYS MAKE THAT CHANGE BUT THIS

02:24:45.009 --> 02:24:47.278
WOULD AT LEAST ADDRESS THE I'M

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:49.781

PROCESS LAST YEAR.

02:25:10.768 --> 02:25:12.537

02:25:12.603 --> 02:25:14.972
DISPOSAL ISSUE IN ANY CONCERNS

02:25:15.039 --> 02:25:16.474

I'D.

02:25:21.446 --> 02:25:22.313

02:25:23.648 --> 02:25:25.850

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:28.352
THE TRAIN IS STATE RIGHT NOW

[inaudible]

02:28:01.505 --> 02:28:04.141
COMMENT.

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:05.776
I'LL JUST NOTE THAT IN A WE'RE

02:28:05.843 --> 02:28:07.445
WE HAVE TO BE VERY STINGY

02:28:07.511 --> 02:28:09.280
HEARING GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS

02:28:09.347 --> 02:28:12.216
BECAUSE WE'RE STILL IN THE A. B..

02:28:12.283 --> 02:28:14.218
THIRTY TWO OUR ARENA I KNOW THAT

02:28:14.285 --> 02:28:15.653
WE PASSED SOME EXTENSIONS BUT

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:18.322
THAT BEGINS WITH THE OPTIONS IN

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.923
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THERE'S A

02:28:18.990 --> 02:28:20.458
VERY CLOSE NEXUS THAT HAS TO BE

02:28:20.524 --> 02:28:21.125
SHOWN.

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:23.027
ON THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE

02:28:23.094 --> 02:28:25.263
GASES FOR FUNDS TO TREAT MONEY

02:28:25.329 --> 02:28:27.231
CENTER USE FROM THE FUND AND

02:28:27.298 --> 02:28:29.300
THAT'S WELL THE TRAININGS FINE

02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:30.434
AND THERE'S OTHER.

02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:31.469
THERE'S OTHER JOB TRAINING

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:32.637
PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET

02:28:32.703 --> 02:28:34.639
THAT ARE IN THERE ONE OF THE

02:28:34.705 --> 02:28:39.810
THINGS THAT OUR OUR DUTY HERE IS

02:28:39.877 --> 02:28:41.512
TO AS WE SEE FROM THE AUCTION

02:28:41.579 --> 02:28:43.014
PROCEEDS SO.

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:45.916
THIS SHE'S IT'S IT'S IN THERE

02:28:45.983 --> 02:28:47.718
FOR AT A HUNDRED NOT VERY MUCH.

02:28:47.785 --> 02:28:49.820
AND FINANCE MAY HAVE A COMMENT

02:28:49.887 --> 02:28:50.588
ON THAT.

02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:51.689
SURE SIT IN THE AMOUNT THAT'S

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:53.157
INCLUDED IS REFLECTIVE OF SORT

02:28:53.224 --> 02:28:55.459
OF TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT THE

02:28:55.526 --> 02:28:56.761
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS PROGRAM

02:28:56.827 --> 02:28:59.063
SUPPORTS THE FIRE PREVENTION

02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:01.299
PERSONNEL THAT I CAL FIRE.

02:29:01.365 --> 02:29:02.967
WITHIN SORT OF CAL FIRES RANKS

02:29:03.034 --> 02:29:05.369
AND SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT AS A

02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:06.570
PART OF SUPPORTING THAT STAFF

02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:07.571
THERE WOULD BE A PORTION OF THAT

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:09.707
PROGRAM THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO

02:29:09.774 --> 02:29:10.474
THE OVERALL FUNDING MODEL AND

02:29:10.541 --> 02:29:11.042
THEN.

02:29:11.108 --> 02:29:12.710
JUST TO THE NEXUS BECAUSE OF

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:15.279
WHAT WE MAY TRAIN PEOPLE TO

02:29:15.346 --> 02:29:16.113
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES THE

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:18.049
CLEANING DOESN'T REDUCE THEM AT

02:29:18.115 --> 02:29:19.583
I MEAN I KNOW PEOPLE WHEN THEY

02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:20.351
GET THERE.

02:29:20.418 --> 02:29:22.386
BUT WE'RE STINGY HERE AS FAR AS

02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:24.455
SAYING ONCE THEIR TRAIN I GET

02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:29.126
THAT THEIR THEIR PARTNER THERE.

02:29:29.193 --> 02:29:31.362
HEY YOU KNOW STAFFING WILL

02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:32.530
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES.

02:29:32.596 --> 02:29:33.331
ALL I CAN SAY TO THAT IS IS THAT

02:29:33.397 --> 02:29:33.931
THIS IS A PROGRAM WITHIN CAL

02:29:33.998 --> 02:29:35.399
FIRE THAT SUPPORTS ALL OF

02:29:35.466 --> 02:29:36.767
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAMS AND SO

02:29:36.834 --> 02:29:37.968
FROM THAT SENSE.

02:29:38.035 --> 02:29:39.337
AND THEN THE OTHER COMPONENT OF

02:29:39.403 --> 02:29:41.639
THIS IS THE FACT THAT WE WE DO

02:29:41.706 --> 02:29:43.541
HAVE AND SORT OF THE THE NATURE

02:29:43.607 --> 02:29:44.508
OF THE BACK STILL OF THE SEA

02:29:44.575 --> 02:29:46.477
RESPONSIBILITY AREA FIRE

02:29:46.544 --> 02:29:48.446
PREVENTION FUND SAID THIS.

02:29:48.512 --> 02:29:50.014

CONSISTENT WITH CAL FIRE

02:29:58.222 --> 02:29:59.423
SPACEPLANE FUNDING MODEL.

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:00.758
AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE BACK

02:30:00.825 --> 02:30:02.660
FILLING IT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:30:02.727 --> 02:30:03.427
SUPPORTED THROUGH THE STATE

02:30:03.494 --> 02:30:04.695
RESPONSIBILITY AREA FIRE

02:30:04.762 --> 02:30:09.100
PREVENTION FUNDS WITH THE

02:30:09.166 --> 02:30:11.335
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND.

02:30:11.402 --> 02:30:13.003

OUTLAYS PROGRAMS CENTER MINING

02:30:24.849 --> 02:30:25.916
DC THE ITEMS WERE WERE WE'RE NOT

DOING THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:28.786
WERE ACTUALLY.

02:30:28.853 --> 02:30:30.521
PROPOSING TO REMOVE THESE

02:30:30.588 --> 02:30:32.690
OUTDATED OUR MOVE BEYOND THESE

02:30:38.496 --> 02:30:41.565
SO THE REQUEST IS --

02:30:41.632 --> 02:30:42.099
FOR FORTY JUST OVER FORTY

02:30:42.166 --> 02:30:45.035
MILLION DOLLARS --

02:30:45.102 --> 02:30:45.903
FOR FIFTEEN CAPITAL OUTLAY

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:48.406
PROJECTS INCLUDING ACQUISITION.

02:30:48.472 --> 02:30:50.341
PRELIMINARY PLANS A WORKING

02:30:50.408 --> 02:30:51.876
DRAWINGS --

02:30:51.942 --> 02:30:54.912
CONSTRUCTION AND MINOR PRICE.

02:30:54.979 --> 02:30:56.447
THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IN CAL

02:30:56.514 --> 02:30:59.049
FIRES FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE --

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:00.084
PLAN -- FOR

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:03.053
MULTIPLE YEARS IN SOME CASES --

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:04.355
SOME OF THEM --

02:31:04.422 --> 02:31:06.290
OVER THE YEARS HAVE FALLEN OFF

02:31:06.357 --> 02:31:08.926
OF THE PLAN --

02:31:08.993 --> 02:31:11.162
EVEN AFTER HAVING BEEN TO GO

02:31:11.228 --> 02:31:13.030
THROUGH THEIR PRELIMINARY

02:31:13.097 --> 02:31:14.732
FINDING A FOUR I MEAN FOR

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:17.802
FUNDING FOR PRELIMINARY PLANS.

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:21.105
AND SOME OF THE STUDY. FOR THE

02:31:21.172 --> 02:31:22.139
THOSE --

02:31:22.206 --> 02:31:23.207
FACILITIES --

02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:25.342
DUE TO THE GENERAL FUND --

02:31:25.409 --> 02:31:28.112
REDUCTIONS DURING THE RECESSION --

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:31.715
THAT THAT WAS MOST RECENTLY --

02:31:31.782 --> 02:31:33.717
MEAL AT TEN TWELVE YEARS AGO

02:31:33.784 --> 02:31:35.119
BEHIND US NOW.

02:31:35.186 --> 02:31:37.822
BUT WHAT I I WANT TO REFLECT IS

02:31:37.888 --> 02:31:40.357
WHILE THEY ARE SHOWN AS NEW

02:31:40.424 --> 02:31:42.126
FUNDING.

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:43.994
THEY ARE OLD TO THE PLAN.

02:31:44.061 --> 02:31:47.598
MOST OF THESE PAST AND NOW

02:31:47.665 --> 02:31:49.266
THEY'RE SHOWING UP AGAIN --

02:31:49.333 --> 02:31:50.501
BEFORE YOU.

02:31:50.568 --> 02:31:53.437
APPROXIMATELY 80% OF

02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:54.905
CALIFORNIA'S FACILITIES WERE

02:31:54.972 --> 02:31:58.242
CONSTRUCTED PRE.

02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:59.009
NINETEEN SEVENTY HAND THE

02:31:59.076 --> 02:32:01.378
OPERATIONAL LIFE CYCLE OF OF OUR

02:32:01.445 --> 02:32:03.848
FACILITIES IS IS ABOUT FIFTY

02:32:03.914 --> 02:32:04.415
YEARS.

02:32:04.482 --> 02:32:06.350
SO -- WE ARE

02:32:06.417 --> 02:32:07.785
AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE REALLY

02:32:07.852 --> 02:32:10.154
WORKING TO REPLACE --

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:13.123
WHAT WE CAN WHEN WE CAN --

02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:15.025
THE OLDER FACILITIES.

02:32:15.092 --> 02:32:16.927
ARE -- AN

02:32:16.994 --> 02:32:18.262
ISSUE FOR US --

02:32:18.329 --> 02:32:20.631
IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T FIT THE

02:32:20.698 --> 02:32:22.600
APPARATUS THE FIRE ENGINES AND

02:32:22.666 --> 02:32:23.934
EQUIPMENT THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

02:32:24.001 --> 02:32:25.703
USING -- AND

02:32:25.769 --> 02:32:28.672
THEN THEY ALSO WERE NOT BUILT.

02:32:28.739 --> 02:32:29.840
TO A BUILDING CODES THAT WOULD

02:32:29.907 --> 02:32:34.311
BE EXCEPT OF FURTHER --

02:32:34.378 --> 02:32:37.281
THEY ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF

02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:38.849
TODAY'S MODERN WORKFORCE --

02:32:38.916 --> 02:32:40.184
THEY ARE --

02:32:40.251 --> 02:32:42.820
VERY MUCH AND IN MANY CASES JUST

02:32:42.887 --> 02:32:45.022
OPENED BERWICK STYLE --

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:46.857
SLEEPING QUARTERS --

02:32:46.924 --> 02:32:49.894
WITH SINGLE SEX BATHROOMS AND

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:51.428
AND THE SAME FOR THOSE SLEEPING

02:32:51.495 --> 02:32:54.265
QUARTERS SO THIS WOULD ALLOW US

02:32:54.331 --> 02:32:55.699
TO MOVE THESE PARTICULAR

02:32:55.766 --> 02:32:57.234
PROJECTS --

02:32:57.301 --> 02:32:59.803
IT FORWARD AND CORRECT SOME OF

02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:00.971
THOSE CONCERNS.

02:33:01.038 --> 02:33:02.206
AND TO MOVE SOME OF THESE

02:33:02.273 --> 02:33:04.808
OBSOLETE FACILITIES TO BECOME

02:33:04.875 --> 02:33:06.377
STORAGE AYE WHEN I WAS GOING

02:33:06.443 --> 02:33:08.312
THROUGH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE

02:33:08.379 --> 02:33:08.913
THESE.

02:33:08.979 --> 02:33:10.948
PODS OF THIS OVER SIMPLIFICATION

02:33:11.015 --> 02:33:13.150
OF FIVE BUILDINGS AND SOME FROM

02:33:13.217 --> 02:33:15.286
OR STORED SOME FROM OUR BARRACKS

02:33:15.352 --> 02:33:19.356
OVER OUR PARKING FACILITIES.

02:33:19.423 --> 02:33:20.524
FOR THE VEHICLES --

02:33:20.591 --> 02:33:22.059
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME FLAVOR OF

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:23.827
WHAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE JUST

02:33:23.894 --> 02:33:25.896
HOST AND THEY JUST THEY'RE DONE

02:33:25.963 --> 02:33:27.865
AND IN SOME OF THEM THAT THEY'RE

02:33:27.932 --> 02:33:28.532
BEING.

02:33:28.599 --> 02:33:31.302
ARRESTED PER ORDERS REPURPOSED

02:33:31.368 --> 02:33:36.206
FOR MOVING FROM A FACILITY --

02:33:36.273 --> 02:33:39.476
OF SLEEPING FACILITY OR AGAIN I

02:33:39.543 --> 02:33:40.544
HAVE BROUGHT UP --

02:33:40.611 --> 02:33:42.346
MIKE DUGGAN TO ANSWER THAT

02:33:42.413 --> 02:33:45.049
QUESTION.

02:33:45.115 --> 02:33:46.517
I'D SAY WE DEFINITELY LOOK TO

02:33:46.584 --> 02:33:47.851
REPURPOSE ANYTHING THAT WE

02:33:47.918 --> 02:33:49.653
POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:51.388
THAT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY CYCLE --

02:33:51.455 --> 02:33:54.658
IS AT A MINIMUM --

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:55.259
FIVE YEARS.

02:33:55.326 --> 02:33:56.360
TYPICALLY --

02:33:56.427 --> 02:33:58.362
SO IF WE CAN REALIZE A STRUCTURE

02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:59.563
FOR STORAGE --

02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:01.065
WE DEFINITELY WILL HAVE YOU

02:34:01.131 --> 02:34:02.666
CHANGED THE OCCUPANCY OF THE

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:03.867
BUILDING THEN YOU HAVE TO BRING

02:34:03.934 --> 02:34:05.002
IT UP TO CURRENT CODE.

02:34:05.069 --> 02:34:06.737
AND IN SOME CASES THAT DOESN'T

02:34:06.804 --> 02:34:08.639
ALLOW US TO QUICKLY SWAP

02:34:08.706 --> 02:34:09.840
SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE IT WOULD

02:34:09.907 --> 02:34:12.242
POSSIBLY REQUIRE RE DOING ALL

02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:13.143
THE ELECTRICAL OR BRINGING IN.

02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:14.678
FIRE SPRINKLERS --

02:34:14.745 --> 02:34:16.213
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE --

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:18.949
ANY WATER TANKS ARE FIRE WATER

02:34:19.016 --> 02:34:19.850
FLOW.

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:22.753
HOW ABOUT THE CCC BECAUSE WE'RE

02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:24.421
TALKING ABOUT THE BERRICS THAT

02:34:24.488 --> 02:34:25.756
MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATED FOR

02:34:25.823 --> 02:34:26.957
PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS BUT

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:28.392
FIRST?

02:34:28.459 --> 02:34:29.493
HIGH SCHOOL --

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.528
YOUNG ADULTS THAT MAY BE

02:34:31.595 --> 02:34:34.198
APPROPRIATE ON AN INTERIM BASIS

02:34:34.264 --> 02:34:35.799
AND I'M THINKING ABOUT SOME.

02:34:35.866 --> 02:34:36.867
FACILITY THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO

02:34:36.934 --> 02:34:42.339
INCREASE. TWELVE INVENTOR --

02:34:42.406 --> 02:34:43.641
THE WEEK CONFERRED THE

02:34:43.707 --> 02:34:45.442
CONSERVATION CAMP TO A FREE

02:34:45.509 --> 02:34:47.745
PERSON FACILITY WHICH CAUSED

02:34:47.811 --> 02:34:51.248
MANY PROBLEMS IN THE SENSE OF

02:34:51.315 --> 02:34:53.784
THE THE I GUESS THE THEORY.

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:55.753
BEHIND THE TWO IS DIFFERENT IN

02:34:55.819 --> 02:34:57.388
OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED

02:34:57.454 --> 02:34:58.822
TO CONFINE PEOPLE AND IN THE

02:34:58.889 --> 02:34:59.990
FREE PERSON SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED

02:35:00.057 --> 02:35:01.692
TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THEY HAVE

02:35:01.759 --> 02:35:02.292
TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT THROUGH

02:35:02.359 --> 02:35:03.293
WINDOWS.

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.362
THROUGH DOORS --

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:06.764
CORRIDORS WE HAD THAT WE WE'VE

02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:07.398
LOOKED --

02:35:07.464 --> 02:35:09.600
MANY WAYS TO UTILIZE WHATEVER WE

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:12.069
CAN AND IN IN SOME CASES LOOKED

02:35:12.136 --> 02:35:13.671
OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO UTILIZE

02:35:13.737 --> 02:35:15.039
THEIR FACILITIES AND AND

02:35:15.105 --> 02:35:16.473
REPURPOSE THOSE --

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:21.278
THE SEAS I WOULD SAY ARE JUST AS

02:35:21.345 --> 02:35:23.447
CAN POSSIBLY UTILIZE THINGS I

02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:24.181
KNOW WHEN --

02:35:24.248 --> 02:35:25.182
THE CAMERI --

02:35:25.249 --> 02:35:26.417
FACILITY WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT

02:35:26.483 --> 02:35:28.352
DOOR TO THE VENTURA CAMP --

02:35:28.419 --> 02:35:30.120

02:35:30.187 --> 02:35:32.322
TO ACCOMMODATE US AND REQUIRE

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:33.323
MEMBERS.

02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:34.958
MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT COMES

02:35:35.025 --> 02:35:37.261
WITH THE HAVE FREE HEFTY PRICE

02:35:37.327 --> 02:35:38.495

SURPRISED TO TO LEARN HOW MANY

02:35:44.535 --> 02:35:46.203
OF THE FACILITIES ARE RENTED.

02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:47.371
AND THAT THERE'S THAT THE

02:35:47.438 --> 02:35:49.073
RELEASE THAT THE LEASES ARE

02:35:49.139 --> 02:35:53.444
COMING UP AND THEY'RE OBSOLETE

02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:55.312
AND NOW THE LANDLORD WHEN SICK.

02:35:55.379 --> 02:35:56.046
CHECK OUT THE BILL THE CHUCKY

02:35:56.113 --> 02:35:57.014
CHEESE WHATEVER'S WHATEVER'S

GOING ON WHAT.

02:35:59.616 --> 02:36:01.785
WHAT IS THE WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN

02:36:01.852 --> 02:36:02.519
GOING FORWARD --

02:36:02.586 --> 02:36:04.888
WE ACQUIRING SITES ARE WE

02:36:04.955 --> 02:36:06.690
LEASING OTHER SITES AND BUILDING

02:36:06.757 --> 02:36:09.893
UP PEOPLE PEOPLES --

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:12.296
OF REMOTE PROPERTIES.

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:14.765
I WOULD SAY ON A THE LARGEST.

02:36:14.832 --> 02:36:16.300
SCALE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

02:36:16.366 --> 02:36:19.603
WE REALIZE THE TIME AND FISCAL

02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:21.772
IMPACT ON THE STATE TO PRODUCE

02:36:21.839 --> 02:36:23.173
THESE FACILITIES.

02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:24.875
AND PROVIDING THEM ON A SHORT

02:36:24.942 --> 02:36:28.178
TERM LEASE OF MAYBE TEN FIFTEEN

02:36:28.245 --> 02:36:29.279
YEARS --

02:36:29.346 --> 02:36:31.148
WHERE ONCE WE COME TO THE TABLE

02:36:31.215 --> 02:36:33.984
AGAIN --

02:36:34.051 --> 02:36:36.086
THEY HAVE US OVER A BARREL --

02:36:36.153 --> 02:36:38.255
SO WE ARE LOOKING TO ACQUIRE

02:36:38.322 --> 02:36:39.823
WHAT WE CAN IN PLACES AND

02:36:39.890 --> 02:36:41.024
THERE'S SOME FACILITIES AND SOME

02:36:41.091 --> 02:36:42.793
OF THIS CAPITAL PLAN THAT WE

02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:44.094
HAVE TO LEASE THE FACILITY.

02:36:44.161 --> 02:36:45.696
ARE WE LEAST LEAST THE GROUND

02:36:45.763 --> 02:36:47.664
LIKE AT THE AIRPORTS WE CAN'T ON

02:36:47.731 --> 02:36:49.466
THE PHYSICAL GROUND --

02:36:49.533 --> 02:36:50.868
BUT THOSE ARE LONG TERM LEASES

02:36:50.934 --> 02:36:52.302
PREFERABLY --

02:36:52.369 --> 02:36:53.470
THE OTHER LEASES THAT WE DO HAVE

02:36:53.537 --> 02:36:54.772
OR WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT

02:36:54.838 --> 02:36:57.341
AGENCIES AND WE TRY TO GET THE

SERVICE AND CONSERVATION CAMPS

02:37:03.013 --> 02:37:04.882
AND OTHER FIRE STATIONS.

02:37:04.948 --> 02:37:07.484
AN MY FINAL QUESTION WHAT IS A

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:08.452
FIVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR

02:37:08.519 --> 02:37:09.953
KITCHEN AND TO HIM A COUNTY LOOK

02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:10.854
LIKE.

I WAS LOOKING AT THE EACH EACH

02:37:11.989 --> 02:37:15.993
E. IN CAMP REPLACEMENT KITCHEN I

02:37:16.059 --> 02:37:18.929

WELL --

02:37:21.165 --> 02:37:23.667
ACTUALLY HE WE TRIED --

02:37:23.734 --> 02:37:24.868
VERY CREATIVE METHOD

02:37:24.935 --> 02:37:25.169
[inaudible]

02:37:25.235 --> 02:37:26.436
IN [inaudible]

02:37:26.503 --> 02:37:30.407
AND IN IN THAT PROJECT WE HAD A

02:37:30.474 --> 02:37:32.276
FIRE THAT TOTALED THE KITCHEN AT

02:37:32.342 --> 02:37:33.243
THE CAMP.

02:37:33.310 --> 02:37:35.012
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT WE

02:37:35.078 --> 02:37:37.581
KNEW AT THE FACILITY IN

02:37:37.648 --> 02:37:39.716
SUSANVILLE CDC ARE HAD JUST

02:37:39.783 --> 02:37:42.019
PRODUCED THE PLANS. FOR A A

02:37:42.085 --> 02:37:44.121
KITCHEN THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO

02:37:44.188 --> 02:37:45.956
WHAT ARE NEED WOULD BE --

02:37:46.023 --> 02:37:48.625
WE HAD TO MODIFY IT A LITTLE BIT --

02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:50.694
JUST AS FAR AS THE COMPONENTS

02:37:50.761 --> 02:37:51.962
INSIDE BUT PRIMARILY WE WERE

02:37:52.029 --> 02:37:53.564
TAKING IT AS IS SO WE HAD A

02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:55.165
RATHER AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO

02:37:55.232 --> 02:37:57.634
UTILIZE THAT PLAN AND SITE

02:37:57.701 --> 02:37:58.569
LOCATED.

02:37:58.635 --> 02:38:00.437
AT TAMA COUNTY --

02:38:00.504 --> 02:38:06.276
A A CAMP KITCHEN IT'S DEFINITELY

02:38:06.343 --> 02:38:08.178
HAVE A LOT OF CODE --

02:38:08.245 --> 02:38:10.113
SITUATIONS WITH THAT --

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:12.015
BEING THAT IT'S AN INSTITUTION

02:38:12.082 --> 02:38:13.217
SO IT HAS TO MEET --

02:38:13.283 --> 02:38:14.885
CORRECTIONAL STANDARDS NOT

02:38:14.952 --> 02:38:18.288
REGULAR COMMERCIAL STANDARDS --

02:38:18.355 --> 02:38:19.723
IN.

02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:22.826
EDUCATE ME MORE ON YOUR MIND.

02:38:22.893 --> 02:38:25.462
I HAVE I'VE WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:38:25.529 --> 02:38:28.799
FACILITIES STATIONS --

02:38:28.866 --> 02:38:30.534
AND A LOT OF MONEY THAT GOES

02:38:30.601 --> 02:38:32.536
INTO THE PRELIMINARY PLANS IN

02:38:32.603 --> 02:38:35.305
THE WORKING DRAWINGS AND IT IT

02:38:35.372 --> 02:38:35.472
IT.

02:38:35.539 --> 02:38:36.907
IT SEEMS I DON'T WANNA TO DUMB

02:38:36.974 --> 02:38:39.109
DOWN THE FACILITIES BUT IT SEEMS

02:38:39.176 --> 02:38:40.978
LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE ONE

02:38:41.044 --> 02:38:41.778
MODEL.

02:38:41.845 --> 02:38:44.014
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE WHAT

02:38:44.081 --> 02:38:46.216
THE CAL FIRE STATION WHO.

02:38:46.283 --> 02:38:47.751
LOOKS LIKE AND FEELS LIKE IT'S

02:38:47.818 --> 02:38:49.219
SORT OF THAT SOME ARCHITECTS

02:38:49.286 --> 02:38:50.721
WOULD SAY HISTORICALLY WHEN YOU

02:38:50.787 --> 02:38:52.356
WALKED INTO A POST OFFICE YOU

02:38:52.422 --> 02:38:54.157
HAD THAT FEELING LIKE THIS WAS

02:38:54.224 --> 02:38:55.626
THE POST OFFICE BUT DIDN'T

02:38:55.692 --> 02:38:57.427

02:38:57.494 --> 02:38:57.861
YOU HAD.

02:38:57.928 --> 02:39:00.130
SO I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL

02:39:00.197 --> 02:39:01.531
GO TO ONE OF THESE.

02:39:01.598 --> 02:39:03.667
FIRE STATIONS IN A REMOTE AREA

02:39:03.734 --> 02:39:06.904
BUT IT SHOULD BE THE DORMITORY

02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:07.204
SHOULD BE.

02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:08.906
PRETTY.

02:39:08.972 --> 02:39:11.975
SIMILAR AT LEAST NINETEEN

02:39:12.042 --> 02:39:13.677
VERSION OF IT AND I JUST AS I GO

02:39:13.744 --> 02:39:15.379
THROUGH AND I LOOK AT THIS IS

02:39:15.445 --> 02:39:16.747
ANOTHER'S DRAWING FOR THIS IS

THAT THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

02:39:32.262 --> 02:39:33.297
I THINK YOU'RE GENERALLY SAYING

02:39:33.363 --> 02:39:35.065
HOW COME WE CAN'T COOKIE CUTTER

02:39:35.132 --> 02:39:36.800
THESE AND GET THEM OUT FASTER.

02:39:36.867 --> 02:39:38.735
THAT WOULD BE YET THAT WOULD BE --

02:39:38.802 --> 02:39:40.370
YEAH WE DEFINITELY LOOK INTO

02:39:40.437 --> 02:39:41.838
THAT -- AS

02:39:41.905 --> 02:39:43.874
FAR AS LIKE TO MACULA WHICH IS A

02:39:43.941 --> 02:39:45.142
PREVIOUS --

02:39:45.208 --> 02:39:47.644
PREVIOUS BUDGET AND ELSINORE --

02:39:47.711 --> 02:39:49.947
THOSE SHOULD BE --

02:39:50.013 --> 02:39:51.882
VERY SIMILAR IF NOT EXACT AS FAR

02:39:51.949 --> 02:39:53.884
AS THE STAFFING LEVEL THE

02:39:53.951 --> 02:39:55.852
CLIMATE LOCATION SO AND

02:39:55.919 --> 02:39:57.688
STRUCTURALLY AS FAR AS SEISMIC

02:39:57.754 --> 02:39:59.856
ZONE SO WE WERE LOOKING TO TRY

02:39:59.923 --> 02:40:01.458
AND UTILIZE THAT AND GET THAT.

02:40:01.525 --> 02:40:05.662
PROJECT OUT ONE OF THE I WOULD

02:40:05.729 --> 02:40:08.565
SAY GOALS OR PRODDING SAID WE'VE --

02:40:08.632 --> 02:40:10.167

EXECUTE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:40:14.137 --> 02:40:15.272
NOT --

02:40:15.339 --> 02:40:16.606
SPECIAL DESIGN.

02:40:16.673 --> 02:40:19.910
EACH INDIVIDUAL PROJECT SO --

02:40:19.977 --> 02:40:22.746
I BELIEVE IN THE C. --

02:40:22.813 --> 02:40:25.449
ONE THIRTY PROPOSAL OUR ISSUE --

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:26.249
WE'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING THE

02:40:26.316 --> 02:40:28.852
SAME BARRACKS IN ALL LOCATIONS.

02:40:28.919 --> 02:40:31.855

LOCATIONS WHICH IS SHOULD BE.

02:40:43.066 --> 02:40:45.669
OF QUITE SIMPLE BECAUSE AIRPORTS

THE ONLY CHANGE THAT WE COULD

02:40:52.242 --> 02:40:54.845
FOR SEE IS --

CONTRACT COUNTIES --

02:44:39.669 --> 02:44:41.871
WOULD GET OUT OF THAT SAME --

02:44:41.938 --> 02:44:43.807
FUNDING MECHANISM --

02:44:43.873 --> 02:44:47.978
AND NOT END UP WITH IN SOME

02:44:48.044 --> 02:44:49.579
YEARS AND MUCH LESS IN OTHER

02:44:49.646 --> 02:44:52.015
YEARS.

02:44:52.082 --> 02:44:54.351
I GUESS THE STAFF REPORT THIS IS

02:44:54.417 --> 02:44:55.986
THE SORT OF A GUESSTIMATE ON

02:44:56.052 --> 02:44:57.621
RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL

02:44:57.687 --> 02:44:59.222
REIMBURSEMENT THAT THEY'RE

02:44:59.289 --> 02:45:00.323
GETTING GETTING LA --

02:45:00.390 --> 02:45:01.992
DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT

02:45:02.058 --> 02:45:04.494
YEAH SO AND JUST.

02:45:04.561 --> 02:45:05.829
TO PROVIDE A LITTLE HISTORY AND

02:45:05.895 --> 02:45:07.264
THAT THAT THE STATE USED TO

02:45:07.330 --> 02:45:08.598
PROVIDE FUNDING A CONTRACT

02:45:08.665 --> 02:45:10.200

HAS NOT PROVIDED THAT FUNDING.

02:45:11.668 --> 02:45:13.603
SENSE --

02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:14.104
TWELVE THIRTEEN WITH THE

02:45:14.170 --> 02:45:15.105
EXCEPTION OF A VERY SMALL AMOUNT

02:45:15.171 --> 02:45:17.741
OF MONEY PROVIDING.

02:45:17.807 --> 02:45:18.942
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN I'M AND SO IT

02:45:19.009 --> 02:45:20.176
YOU KNOW AS YOU'RE WINNING YOUR

AND MEET YOU KNOW.

02:45:23.213 --> 02:45:24.347
REINSTATING THIS FUNDING IS

02:45:24.414 --> 02:45:25.915
REASONABLE CONTRACT COUNTIES ARE

DO THAT AS TO THE OVERALL

02:45:33.123 --> 02:45:34.724
CONCEPT IS REASONABLE THE

02:45:34.791 --> 02:45:36.326
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH JUST

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:39.362
REINSTATE THE I AM PRIOR FORMULA

02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:40.997
ON THE FORMULA THEY USE TO FIND

02:45:41.064 --> 02:45:41.865
THE SUPPORT.

02:45:41.931 --> 02:45:44.000
AND THAT THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT --

02:45:44.067 --> 02:45:45.902
WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT IT THE THE

02:45:45.969 --> 02:45:47.537
FORMULA THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:45:47.604 --> 02:45:49.506
THE CAPITAL OUTLAY SIDE AND NOT

02:45:49.572 --> 02:45:51.441
COMMENTING ON HOW THE SAME

02:45:55.712 --> 02:45:56.346
OUTLAY SIDE?

02:45:56.413 --> 02:45:57.981
IT'S NOT BASED ON WHAT THE

02:45:58.048 --> 02:45:59.182
CAPITAL OUTLAY NEEDS ARE.

02:45:59.249 --> 02:46:01.618
AND AND SO EASY BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:46:01.685 --> 02:46:03.053
REALLY TIED TO THE NEEDS YOU

02:46:03.119 --> 02:46:04.854
DON'T HAVE TO USE THAT FORMULA

02:46:04.921 --> 02:46:07.257
IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO

02:46:07.324 --> 02:46:08.625
RINSTATE THE FUNDING TEAM YOU

02:46:08.692 --> 02:46:14.464
MIGHT CHOOSE TO DO THAT --

02:46:14.531 --> 02:46:15.098
FOR CONSISTENCY'S SAKE WITH THE

02:46:15.165 --> 02:46:17.934
WAY WE HOW MUCH MONEY WANT TO

02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:19.336
GIVING GIVING THEM THAT AMOUNT

02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:20.570
EVERY YEAR --

02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:22.339
WE AND TOOK A LOOK BACK IN

THE LAST ROUGHLY A DECADE OR SO.

02:46:29.245 --> 02:46:30.146
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD

02:46:30.213 --> 02:46:31.514
BE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED

02:46:31.581 --> 02:46:33.049
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LOWEST

02:46:33.116 --> 02:46:34.984
YEAR AND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND

02:46:35.051 --> 02:46:36.453

02:46:39.089 --> 02:46:40.223
KIND OF BASICALLY NOTHING WHEN

02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:42.959
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THAT

02:46:43.026 --> 02:46:43.526
BUYS YOU IN TERMS OF CAPITAL

AGAIN THERE'S NO WE NEED TO TO

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:55.405
ACTUALLY USE THIS FORMULA

02:46:55.472 --> 02:46:56.639
BECAUSE IT'S NOT BASED ON WHAT

02:46:56.706 --> 02:46:58.308
THEIR ACTUAL NEEDS ARE.

02:46:58.375 --> 02:46:59.743
WE WE KIND OF RECOGNIZE THE BE

02:46:59.809 --> 02:47:01.244
PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO GET TO A

02:47:01.311 --> 02:47:02.846
PLACE WHERE YOU SAY WHAT THOSE

02:47:02.912 --> 02:47:04.247

02:47:04.314 --> 02:47:05.181
EXPENSIVE --

AND IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED

02:47:06.449 --> 02:47:07.884
QUESTION TO ANSWER AND TO

02:47:07.951 --> 02:47:09.386
CONTINUALLY UPDATE THE DATA AND

02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:10.587
SO WE THINK MAYBE JUST PICKING

02:47:10.653 --> 02:47:12.021
THEM OUT IS IS A SIMPLER

02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:13.456
APPROACH FOR YOU YOU COULD PICK

02:47:13.523 --> 02:47:14.057
THE AMOUNT.

YEAR AT THE THREE POINT THREE

02:47:16.659 --> 02:47:18.395
MILLION THE AVERAGE OF WHAT IT

02:47:18.461 --> 02:47:19.262
WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST

02:47:19.329 --> 02:47:21.097
TEN YEARS TO BE ABOUT TWO POINT

02:47:21.164 --> 02:47:21.898
TWO MILLION.

02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:23.133
THAT WE COULD PICK SOME OTHER

02:47:23.199 --> 02:47:23.867
AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE

02:47:23.933 --> 02:47:25.301
WITH THEN YOU CAN EVEN SET UP A

02:47:25.368 --> 02:47:28.872
PROCESS TO REVISIT THE AMOUNT

02:47:28.938 --> 02:47:29.706
OVER TIME.

02:47:29.773 --> 02:47:30.573
SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT WERE

02:48:05.708 --> 02:48:07.944
AND SAID THAT --

02:48:08.011 --> 02:48:10.747
THAT COMES DOWN TO THE NAY UPSET

02:48:10.814 --> 02:48:12.282

CERTAINLY REINSTATING THE OLD

02:50:53.810 --> 02:50:55.378
FORMULA IS ONE WAY TO DO IT BUT

02:50:55.445 --> 02:50:56.613
IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS SINCE

02:50:57.981 --> 02:50:59.949
COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE

ANOTHER LOOK --

02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:03.219

FIRE STATION IN MARIN AND THAT

02:51:04.921 --> 02:51:06.155

02:51:08.391 --> 02:51:09.659

02:51:15.898 --> 02:51:17.433
INTO THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SO

02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:18.968
