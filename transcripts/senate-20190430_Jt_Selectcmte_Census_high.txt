THE CENSUS. WHAT CENSUS DAY APRIL FIRST? TWENTY TWENTY LESS THAN A YEAR OUT SO LIKE LEMON MONTHS -- WE ARE NOW CONVENE OR SENT SECOND SENSES HEARING OF THE SESSION. I LIKE TO WORK ON MY COLLEAGUES -- CENTER I'M BIRD MY CO CHAIR IN THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE AND OTHER BERMAN I UNDERSTAND IS. OCCUPIED WITH A NOTE TO MAYBE IT WILL BE ON HIS WAY -- AND AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE OTHER MEMBERS OF SLICK COMMITTEES FOR BEING HERE AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO OUR SELECT COMMITTEES. IN OUR FIRST HEARING WE PROVIDE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S COMPLETE COUNT PROGRAM'S OPERATION PROGRAM OPERATIONS STRATEGY IN FUNDING THE DAY WILL THAT TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO ONE OF THE PARTICULAR. LEE CRUCIAL ASPECTS OF CENSUS OUTRAGE LANGUAGE ACCESS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT 44% OF OUR RESIDENTS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. AND WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION A READY APPROPRIATE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE FIFTY FOUR MILLION THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BY THE GOVERNOR -- WE ARE DEVOTING IMPRESSED A PRESENT RESOURCES ENSURING WE GET A COMPLETE COUNT. HOWEVER BE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE LANGUAGE ACCESS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT -- FOR MANY COMMUNITIES AND CERTAINLY -- FOR THE MY COMMUNITY EIGHTY I COMMUNITY TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PARTICIPATING. SO TODAY'S HEARING WE WILL FOCUS ON HOW RESOURCES ARE BEING LEVERAGED TO REACH LIMITED OF ENGLISH PROFICIENT HOUSEHOLDS AND HOW COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND A LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLAN TO DRESS LANGUAGE ACCESS -- IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO NOW. BUT MY COACH HERE CENTER OF BURKE IF YOU WISH TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS AND THEN THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AS WELL -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF WE HAVE ALREADY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE GET AN ADEQUATE COUNT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. UP IN TODAY WE'RE GONNA DRESS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN PARTICULARLY IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGE -- BETWEEN THE API COMMUNITY LATINO COMMUNITY AND MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD IMPLORE THE LEADERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE THE LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED. IS IT AS GROUPS COME TO YOU. AND COME TO US AND HAVE PROPOSALS TO REACH OUT. THE THAT WE ENSURE THAT. WE ADD TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I KNOW THIS IS BEEN. EMPHASIZED IN THE PAST. BUT I I HAVE A CONCERN I HAVE A CONCERN THAT UNLESS WE UP FRONT EMPHASIZE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND METRICS. TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF WHATEVER WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULT. SO I I WOULD JUST WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT TODAY -- AND THEN THINK AGAIN -- SENATOR PANTRY LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE YES SUMMER. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE TODAY'S HEARING THIS IS A TOPIC THAT -- I HAVE RAISED AS A MEMBER OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING WITH REGARDS TO THE CENSUS. MY APOLOGIES I NEED TO LEAVE IN A FEW MINUTES OF IT'S OKAY THEY'RE JUST A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AT MY HOPE IS. THIS HEARING WILL HELP SETTLE -- FIRST I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME SURPRISES ABOUT SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE BEING IMPOSED -- WITH REGARDS TO MONEY THAT CAME FROM THE R. P. AND I KNOW SOME QUESTIONS ABOT THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND I'M HOPING THAT IT WILL BE EXPLAINED -- AS WE GO THROUGH THE HEARING THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME INDICATIONS THAT THE CENSUS OFFICE WILL BE PROVIDING SOME NEW RESOURCES TO FACILITATE LANGUAGE ACCESS. MY HOPE IS THAT -- THAT WILL BE ELUCIDATED IN TODAY'S HEARING ON EXACTLY WHAT NEW RESOURCES. WILL BE PROVIDED BY A GIVEN THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A DEVELOPMENT OF A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN -- WE HAV RECEIVED A LOT OF CONCERNS FROM THE PUBLIC. WHO HAVE FELT? A BIT OUT OF THE LOOP WHEN IT COMES TO THAT PLANNING AND ARE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WILL BE IN THAT AND MY HOPE IS WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION ON WHAT THE INITIAL THINKING AS AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT A PROCESS WILL. BE ABLE TO GATHER ADEQUATE FEEDBACK FROM AROUND THE STATE ON THIS -- ONE THING I MENTION OF THE LAST ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON THIS TOPIC WAS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THERE IS A REAL MEDIA STRATEGY -- AROUND COORDINATING LANGUAGE ASSET ACCESS ISSUES AND I HOPE THAT THIS HEARING WILL ADDRESS THAT. I KNOW ALSO THEIR NUMBER OF HARD COUNT POPULATIONS WITH LOW LITERACY LEVELS FOR THAT COMMUNICATE PRIMARILY AND NON WRITTEN LANGUAGES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE PRESENTATION HOPEFULLY ADDRESSES THAT -- AND AND YOU KNOW AT A HIGH LEVEL -- WE CANNOT HELP BUT WE CAN WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXPECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WORK WITH CALIFORNIA ON THIS WE ARE ON OUR OWN. AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL PUT IN WHATEVER RESOURCES WE NEED TO WHATEVER COORDINATION WE NEED TO I AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT EVERY. UNITY -- REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THESE COMMUNITIES -- WILL BE ABLE TO OUT BE OUT REACH TO AND THAT WILL BE ABLE TO COUNT EVERYONE -- THIS I THINK POSSIBLY COULD BE THE NUMBER ONE BARRIER TO ENSURING THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL TWENTY TWENTY AND I DO HOPE TO THIS HEARING WILL BE ABLE TO UP TO WALK TO THESE THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THINK IT'S SIMILAR. TO OTHER MEMBERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK. OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS AT THE GETS HANDS UP AND THEN THAT SOME EVER KAMLAGER-DOVE. SOME OF RAMOS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND JUST -- RAISING. THE AWARENESS OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION I KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LANGUAGE AND AND ACCESS THIS THERE BUT ALSO -- THE HARD TO COUNT. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE INTERESTED TO HEAR HOW THE OUT REACH INTO THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS BEING ALSO DONE -- WITH THESE BEARS ARE FRONT OF US. THE MEMBER KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU -- I TO WILL HAVE TO LEAVE A VERY SHORTLY BUT I'M HOPING THAT IN THIS CONVERSATION. WE CAN GET A SENSE OF YEAH -- HOW YOU'RE COMMUNICATING WITH THE VARIOUS COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE I REPRESENT LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND OF COURSE IT IS THE LARGEST ONE IN THE STATE I'M SURE? THEY'RE BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE IN PROACTIVE IN THEIR PLAN BUT IF YOU CAN SHARE SORT OF OF THE CONSISTENCY WITH WHICH YOU'RE COMMUNICATING WITH THE COUNTIES -- ENTER CAM AID. IN CBO'S AND ALSO SOLICITING THEIR FEEDBACK AND INTEGRATING THAT FEEDBACK INTO THE PLAN. AND THEN ONCE AGAIN RECOGNIZING THE HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS -- AND HOPING THAT THERE'S NOT AN OVER RELIANCE ON WRITTEN MATERIALS WHEN WE KNOW THAT SOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNICATE AND RESPOND -- IN NON WRITTEN WAYS AND USING NON WRITTEN LANGUAGES THANK YOU. OF THE S. CENTER CHANGE. WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- I'M VERY VERY A HONOR TO BE ABLE TO JOIN YOU ON THIS PANEL -- I KNOW COMING FROM AND I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD FROM QUITE A FEW OF US FROM THE API COMMUNITY BUT ALSO -- FROM THE IMMIGRANT A. B. I. COMMUNITY WHO DEPEND ON ASIAN OR ETHNIC MEDIA -- TO TO RECEIVE INFORMATION -- I THINK THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IS SOMETHING THAT% WE DO NEED TO LOOK INTO AND EXPLORE BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL IS THE STIGMA. AS TO WHAT THE CENSUS WHAT THE INFORMATION FROM THE CENSUS IS GOING TO BE USED. FOR AND THERE'S A GENERAL FEAR -- AROUND THAT AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF WELL A SOME OF THE CONCERNS BY BEING MORE PROACTIVE SO I THINK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO LET'S SERVE GO AHEAD IT'S A MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST THAT WHILE PANEL OR ACTUALLY FOR SPEAKER. A PANEL OF ONE SO I WANT TO WELCOME. THAT IS SECOND TAG. WHO'S THE WHO IS DIRECTOR OF CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE WELCOME AND APPRECIATE YOUR SHARING WITH US SO WHAT THE PLANS ARE FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS -- FOR A NAY ON HERE YES. THE GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU SENATOR PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON DISK TARGET DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNTS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY OFFICE. YOU CAN SEE FROM MY BIO THIS IS MY THIRD TIME IN THIS -- SERVING IN THIS CAPACITY FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- AND ALSO SERVED AS CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RACE AT THIS THESE AND OTHER POPULATIONS ARE TO THE US CENSUS BUREAU. I WILL SAY THIS MAY THIRD AND IT IS DEFINITELY THE MOST CHALLENGING SO I REALLY APPRECIATE BEING INVITED HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANT ROLE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAYS AND REACHING OUR HARDEST ACCOUNT COMMUNITIES. JUST TO BE CLEAR THE FEDERAL OPERATION OF COURSE THE US CENSUS BUREAU WHICH YOU GUYS EVER HAND OUT THERE. ARE THERE ARE KNOWN ENGLISH LANGUAGE SUPPORT HANDOUTS OR INCLUDE YOUR PACKAGE IN THE RESULT FROM YEARS OF RESEARCH AND DATA ANALYSIS THEY'VE IDENTIFIED TWELVE LANGUAGES TO PRIORITIZE -- IN CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO EXPAND ON THAT NOTED THAT THERE TWELVE LANGUAGES ARE NOT THE HIGHEST A A TOP TROUBLING WHICH IS HERE IN THE STATE. SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX TOPIC AND OUR TEAM IS WORKED HARD OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS TO DEVELOP A REASONED APPROACH WHICH WE WILL SHARE AND I'LL DO MY BEST TO EXPLAIN THIS -- THIS TOPIC IN AND DIG INTO IT SO JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW I'VE BEEN ASKED TO COVER HIM FULL TOPICS SO ONE PROVIDE OVERVIEW AGAIN WHAT THE CENSUS IS RISK FEDERAL CENSUS RESPONSIBLE. FOR WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SENSE OF ACTIVITIES LOOK LIKE AN OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIANS LANGUAGE AS WE SPEAK WHAT IS LANGUAGE ACCESS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A STANDARD DEFINITION. HOW WILL PARTNERS BE EXPECTED TO APPROACH LANGUAGE ACCESS WHAT ARE THE TIMELINES AND REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH -- ARE IT REVISED PLANNED AND NEXT STEPS. SO JUST THE SEPARATION OF ROLES AGAIN THE RULE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SEPARATE FROM OUR ROLE THE CENSUS BUREAU IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENUMERATION PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES THE PROGRAMMING OF THE QUESTION HERE IN LANGUAGE ONLINE AS WELL AS PRINTING. THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE LANGUAGES THAT THE QUESTIONERS PRINTED IN OR PROGRAMMED SO THAT MAKES SENSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE IN THE SUMMER IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED THE PRINTING. AND CONTENT OF ALL OR BALLOTS -- SO WE DON'T CONTROL IT LIKELY WE CONTROL THE BALLOT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL HERE. SO THE STATE OFFICE WE ARE TASK CREATING THE STATE'S LARGEST OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO REACH ALL CALIFORNIANS AND OF COURSE OF COURSE GET THEM TO RESPOND. OF WE ARE SUPPLEMENTING WITH THE US CENSUS BUREAU IS DOING BUT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO SAID WE CANNOT DEPEND ON IT WE CANNOT DEPEND ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT RESOURCES. TO GET ALL CALIFORNIANS COUNTED. SO HOW WILL WE REACH HOW CALIFORNIA REACH THE HEART ACCOUNT FOR THOSE JUST TUNING IN REAL QUICK THE MISSION OF THE COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE ISN'T INSURER. ALL CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR FAIR SHARE FEDERAL RESOURCES AND CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION TO ENCOURAGE A FULL COUNT. LET'S GET ALONG WITH WE REALLY BOIL THAT DOWN WHAT IS THE ONE THING. THAT ALL OF US RELEASE MY TEAM NEEDS TO DO TO ENSURE SUCCESS. THAT'S A GOOD EVERY CALIFORNIA'S FOR THE FOR SIMPLE THEY DON'T PULL IT OUT. WE'RE GONNA COULD BE SUCCESSFUL WE NEED TO FILL IT OUT ACCURATELY AND COMPLETELY SO WE MUST WORK TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO FOLKS CAN EASILY TELL OF THE FORM. WE MUST PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AT THE RIGHT TIME. IN THE RIGHT PLACE BY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. SO BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED AND BEST PRACTICES WE INTEND TO DO THIS THROUGH QUESTIONER ASSISTANCE CENTERS AND KIOSKS SO I WILL NOTE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND WHEN WE DID THE OUT REACH PROGRAM. THE THE ACTUAL BUDGET LINE ITEM WAS NOT OUTRAGE IT WAS NONPROFIT QUESTIONER ASSISTANCE CENTERS BECAUSE WE KNEW IF WE PLACE THOSE DOLLARS IN THOSE HARD TO CONTRACTS. THEY WOULD HAVE RETURN AND THE DATA HAS SHOWN THAT THOSE AREAS WE HAD ACTUAL PHYSICAL BRICKS AND MORTAR QUESTION ASSISTANCE CENTERS HAD ALMOST TRIPLE INCREASE IN RESPONSE RATE FROM. NINETEEN NINETY SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CENTERS AND KIOSKS IS THAT CENTERS ARE STAFFED WITH TRUSTED MESSENGERS WHICH WILL PROVIDE IN LANGUAGE SERVICES TO ASSIST WITH THE SELF RESPONSE PROCESS. KIOSKS ALL SOARING LANGUAGE AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME CONTRACTORS AND COUNTIES HERE THAT ARE TALK ABOUT THEIR KIOSKS BUT THEY'RE ON STAFFED. SO WE WILL ALSO GOING TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF MANY STRATEGIES INCLUDING DATA DRIVEN TARGET OUT REACHING NO WE HAVE THIS QUESTION EARLY ON WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT INCLUDES PHONE BANKING AND CANVASSING BUT THE REASON WHY IT'S DATA DRIVEN. IS BECAUSE IF AN ORGANIZATION DOESN'T LOOK AT THE DATA AND THEIR FOR CALLING JUST **** SORT OF COLD CALLING THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE EFFECTIVE IN THIS COULD BE A WASTE. AND IF YOU USE DATA GOING OUT YOU CAN USE DATA COLLECTED IN SO YOU CAN MEASURE -- TO SERVICE CENTER -- BERG'S POINTYOU CAN MEASURE THE RESULTS BY DAILY IN AND DATA OUT WE ALSO ARE ENCOURAGING CONDUCTING OF EVENTS PUBLIC GATHERINGS. TOWN HALLS AND PROVIDING OF MATERIALS. SO WHAT IS LANGUAGE ACCESS LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS. IS EQUAL AND MEANINGFUL ACCESS FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IN THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND IN ACCESSIBLE FORMATS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HIGHLIGHT OF THAT IT'S ALSO FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND TODAY WE HAD. A WEAPON ARE HOPE YOU GUYS TUNED IN -- WITH THE HELP OF SOME KEY PARTNERS THAT FOCUSED ON THE INCLUSION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FOR THE SENSES IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE. AND WE HAD OVER TWO HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS SO LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES ARE PROTECTED CLASS UNDER FEDERAL STATE LAW. AND THE SENATE LANGUAGE ACCESS SHOULD BE PRACTICAL AND EFFECTIVE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND IT CAN BE READILY IMPLEMENTED. LANGUAGE ACCESS CAN HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS DEPENDING ON THE INDUSTRY WITH A RECORD TO HOSPITALS BUT AS OF TODAY. THERE IS NO STANDARD DEFINITION SO I APPRECIATE THIS HEARING TO HELP US ALLCOME TOGETHER WITH THE DEFINITION THAT MAKES SENSE PERCENT THIS OUTRAGE. SPEAKERS BY THE NUMBERS CENTER PAT HAD MENTIONED -- HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REPORTEDLY SO THERE'S TWO HUNDRED TWENTY LANGUAGES THAT ARE SPOKEN IN CALIFORNIA? RECENT ACS STATE INDICATES IT'S CLOSER TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BUT APPROXIMATELY 99% OF CALIFORNIA SPEAKS THE SET ROUGHLY THE SAME FIFTY LANGUAGES. SO HERE ARE OUR CALIFORNIA'S TOP TWELVE NON ENGLISH LANGUAGES I'VE DONE THE BIG SIX AND THEN THE OTHER ARE DOWN BELOW. THAT'S NINETY THREE POINT 2% OF ALL INDIVIDUAL ELLIE P. L. IN THOSE TOP LANGUAGES AND GET IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- THE CENSUS BUREAU THEIR TOP TOLD LANGUAGES DO NOT MATCH OURS. SO MOVING FORWARD SO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS. IN A WILL BE IN A IN THREE WORDS WE ALL ARE. SO I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE -- REPRESENT HIS REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL OF THESE AREAS HERE TODAY. SO SINCE WE PUBLISH THE REGIONAL LANGUAGE AXE LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS STANDARDS DRAFT IN MID MARCH WE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK FROM PARTNERS EXPERTS. ARE ADVOCATES AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND IN AN EFFORT TO CLOSE TO PROVIDE CLEAR DIRECTION TO ALL PARTNERS WE'VE USED THE VARIOUS THEMES WE HEARD TO IMPROVE OUR PLAN MOVING FORWARD HERE'S SOME OF THE THEMES WE HEARD AND FEEDBACK. THEY SAID ANY REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THEY SAID THERE WEREN'T ANY REQUIREMENTS IN OUR PREVIOUS DROPPED THEIR STANDARDS THEY SAID THEY SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF AN OPERATIONAL PLAN NOT JUST STANDARDS. TO ALLOW FOR PARTNERS TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE. STANDARDS THAT TARGET ONLY THE TOP SIX LANGUAGES WOULD EXCLUDE SMALLER LINGUISTIC COMMUNITIES WHEN WE HEARD THAT LOUD AND CLEAR. THE DRAFT DID NOT SPECIFY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS THAT WOULD RESULT IN GUARANTEED LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR THE HARDEST TO KILL POPULATIONS. WE ALSO HAD REQUESTED JUST AGGREGATE LARGE LANGER GROUPS IN THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGES WHICH WE DID NOT GET DOWN TO THE DETAILS OF THAT. THERE WAS ALSO CONFUSION AROUND REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS LANGUAGE ACCESS PLANS INCLUDING COSTS AND COORDINATION OF EFFORTS ACROSS ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND WHAT THE STATE MIGHT DO TO OFFSET AND LEVERAGE THOSE COSTS SO THOSE ARE BUT TO THE THEMES. SO AS A RESULT OF THAT FEEDBACK% WE'RE DEVELOPING THE FOLLOWING WERE USING LANGUAGE MICRO DATA. UP TO DEVELOP LANGUAGE SUPPORT TRIGGERS WHICH ALSO SPEAK ABOUT IN THE NEXT SLIDE WILL RELEASE A NEW LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS PLAN ON MAY SEVENTEENTH WHICH WILL ADDRESS THE FEEDBACK THAT WE HEARD AN OUTLINE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CONTRACTORS. THE REVISED PLAN WILL INCLUDE HOW THE STATE INTENDS TO SUPPORT LANGUAGE ACTORS ACTIVITIES WHICH WILL INCLUDE A DOT ORG WEBSITE TRANSLATED INTO THE TOP TWELVE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE LANGUAGES. AND TRANSLATED COMMON COLLATERAL TEMPLATES WHICH WERE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THOSE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRANSLATE THEM FIFTY TIMES. WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON USING CONSCIOUS OF CONTRACTORSTRATEGIC PLANS AND OUR REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS FACILITATING THE PARTNERS AND OUR UPCOMING SUMMER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WORKSHOPS TO IDENTIFY WHERE VARIOUS PARTNERS. ACTIVITIES INTERSECT AND WHERE THERE MIGHT BE GAPS. SO THIS NEXT SLIDE I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE MOST COMPLICATED SLIDE I HAVE. TO EXPLAINS A BEAR WITH ME I'LL TRY I'LL TRY TO GO I WON'T TALK IS FASTER THIS. THE QUESTION IS HOW WILL CONTRACTORS KNOW WHAT LANGUAGE TO FOCUS ON SO FIRST OF ALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COVER ENGLISH AND SPANISH. SO WE MODELED OUR APPROACH AFTER EXISTING LAWS WHICH YOU GUYS HAVE IN YOUR HAND OUTS. AND SO HERE GOES THE THE REALLY MORE TECHNICAL STUFF SO USING LANGUAGE MICRO DATA WE DEVELOPED LANGUAGE SUPPORT TRIGGERS WHEN I SING BECAUSE OF THAT MEANS IT'S AT THE THRESHOLD THAT TRIGGERS WHERE SUPPORT FOR A LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE -- IT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO PLACE -- WHICH INDICATOR CONTRACTORS WHICH LANGUAGES MUST BE SUPPORTED IN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC AREA. WITH THESE LANGUAGE TRIGGERS 93% OF ALL ELLIE P. INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE WILL BE COVERED AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THESE THIS WHOLE THING ALL TOGETHER. SO WE TOOK LA COUNTY OUT. TO EXAMINE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE THE SKEW ALL THE DATA. YEAH YEAH WE TOOK HIM OUT WE AND WE WE WILL EXPLAIN WHAT WE DO WITH THEM. BUT WE SAID THE LA COUNTY WOULD BE REQUIRED LOOK AT THEIR LANGUAGE TO COVER THE TOP TWELVE LANGUAGE GROUPS WHICH IS ACTUALLY FIFTEEN LANGUAGES. WHICH WILL COVER NINETY FIVE POINT NINE SIX UP PERCENT OF THEIR ELLIE P. AND IN SOME OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT -- BUT I WAS HEARTENED TO HEAR THEY SAID AND WE WANT TO DO MORE BECAUSE THEY GET IT THEY GET LIKE A 100% A BUT IT JUST COMES DOWN TO RESOURCES AND IUNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW COME STANDARD HOW MUCH WILL COUNT COUNT TO GET THAT LAST. 4%. SO FOR THE REMAINING GEOGRAPHIC DATA GROUPS WE SET A THRESHOLD OF FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT THAT WAS IS WE TOOK ORANGE COUNTY AT THE TOP THERE'S FORTY OF THESE -- DATA AND WE HAD SIERRA AND ABOUT A COUNTIES ON THE BOTTOM IN THE MIDDLE WAS FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND BETWEEN. UP ORANGE COUNTY HAVING OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND ELLIE P. AND ABOUT I COUNTY IT'S YEAR HAVING. NINETEEN HUNDRED AND SO FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND WAS A THRESHOLD OF ANY -- GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT HAD ABOVE FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND AND THE MEDIAN THERE IS THE TRIGGER IS 3% OR THREE THOUSAND SPEAKERS OF THE LANGUAGE. LET MAKES SENSE SO OF THEIR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. IF THERE LET'S JUST SAY -- AND ORANGE COUNTY THEY HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHICH THEY DON'T. BUT IF IF -- TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE SPOKE AS PARTICULARITY BELOW THAT THRESHOLD BUT ANY LANGUAGE THAT WAS ABOVE IT YOU KNOW IT OUT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND MAKING IT SIMPLE THEY WOULD HAVE THAT TRIGGER. OF AND FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PER POPULATION BELOW FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND WHICH IS SOME OF OUR SMALLER COUNTIES. THEY HAD COME A SAFE HARBOR OF A FIFTEEN HUNDRED PERSONS -- TRIGGER THAT MANY DIFFICULT THINKING ABOUT THIS IS MAKES SENSE. GIVE A QUESTION -- DID YOU WANT ME. TO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINESE MANDARIN AND CANTONESE. SO I KNOW THAT. THE WAY THE CENSUS BUREAU AND I'M NOT A SPECIFIC EXPERT IN THIS IS THAT SOME OF THE CALL SIMPLE I CHINESE ONES WRITTEN DID ONE ANSWER ONCE SPOKEN OKAY YES [inaudible] TO LEARN. SO ALL RIGHT WELL WELL I GUESS WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ALTHOUGH I'D LIKE TO THE BROADER QUESTIONS ARE LATER BUT IS SO. I MEAN WHEN WE LET'S ENTERTAIN YOU. YEAH WHY TO GO DO IT I I I COULD TRY TO ANSWER YOU CAN TRY TO ANSWER IT THAT YOU WANTED. TO ADD LIKE CANTONESE IS A DIALOGUE YEAH. THANK GOD. OF WELL. WHAT ABOUT THE CANTONESE AND MANDARIN CANTONESE AND MANDARIN OF BOTH DIALECTS OF CHINESE DIRECTLY OTHER DIALECTS BY THE WAY SO THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THOSE ARE TWO LARGEST DIALECTS? SO -- SO I'M NOT SURE WHY -- C. USUALLY C. IS YOU'LL SEE LIKE EITHER CHINESE PARENTHESES MANDARIN OR MANDARIN PRINTED THE CHINESE AND THE JAPANESE I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY'RE SEPARATED OUT AS WE HAVE LANGUAGE GROUPS AND THE LANGUAGES AND IS BASICALLY HOW THE AMERICAN COMMITTEE SURVEYS. DATACOM'S THOUGH RIGHT YEAH SO IT IS SO THE LISTING I'M NOT SURE HOW. CHINESE IS SEPARATE FROM MANDARIN CANTONESE NOW I'LL TELL YOU TO OTHER CHINESE DIALECTS SO THAT THE BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE THAT WOULD BE LISTED SEPARATELY. AND AND BY THE WAY TO JUST MAKE EVEN MORE INTERESTING -- THE CHARACTERS ARE ACTUALLY ALL THE SAME SO THE WRITTEN PART IS THE SAME YEAH WELL OKAY WELL THAT WE WILL GET LIVE I'LL GET INTO THAT. AT THAT BUT IT BUT THE DIAL EXORCISTS ARE DIFFERENT LINK WE OWN TERMS OF SPOKEN AND HEARD LANGUAGE RIGHT. YEAH THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WAS AND SAY BUT I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK ABOUT. A WIDE -- THERE'S ONLY ONLY GOING TO BE SIMPLIFIED CHINESE RATHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WHEN IT'S TRADITIONAL CHINESE THAT ENCOMPASSES. ALL OF THE CHINESE LIKE I CAN BE TRADITIONAL BUT NOT SIMPLIFIED. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S EVEN A IN ANSWER TO THAT OR HOW HOW. I THINK WITH OKAY SO YEAH SO YEAH SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE WRITTEN PART SO WE HAVE DIALECTS BUT THEN WE TALK ABOUT SIMPLIFIED AND AND I DO WANT TO GET TOO MUCH INTO THIS. SO HE CAN CONTINUE PRESENTATION BUT FOR EXAMPLE. PEOPLE FROM DEPENDING WHERE YOU'RE FROM PEOPLE FROM MAINLAND CHINA HAVE BEEN. DALY EDUCATE OUT ON SIMPLIFIED BUT FOR EXAMPLE YOUR FROM TAIWAN YOU WERE TRAINED AND TRADITIONAL SO. WE HAVE SOME WE MAY HAVE SOME ISSUES THERE WITH THAT SO THAT'S NOT A DIALECT THING BUT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO READ THE WRITTEN MATERIAL. RIGHT AND THEN I WOULD YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR PRESENTATION HERE FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU TO SEE WHICH ONE THERE YEAH. ONLY SOME OF THEM YEAH AND THAT WAS THEIR LANGUAGE DATA CRUNCHING IT. SO IMPORTANT THE FORMS AN ONLINE WILL BE ONLY IN THAT. YES WE DON'T CONTROL THAT BUT WE CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF OUR ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH. ARTS ARE NONPROFIT GROUPS WHO ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT THEY CAN COVER ALL THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS THAT MAKE SENSE SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING. THIS MUCH OF I CAN BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS VERY LIMITED YEAH. AND WE HAVEN'T TURNING IT IS CONCERNING HAVE TO ALLOW THAT ACCESS. THANK YOU TO MOVE ON FROM THE PUBLIC IS LIGHT. AT THE CENTER OF BURKE DEAL DID YOU I'M SORRY QUESTION. REMOVAL QUESTION IS IT IS WHAT I JUST HEARD WAS THAT -- TRADITIONAL CHINESE CHARACTERS. ARE USED BY THOSE WHO ARE. TAIWANESE IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. THE EDUCATED. ALL NOT ALL. YEAH BUT PREDOMINATELY. FROM CHINA AND TAIWAN THEY CAN READ TRADITIONAL. THAT'S THAT'S MY TAKE A GUESS IN TALKING TO A LOT IS JUST TO PUT A PIN IN THIS SEEMS LIKE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA. EN I I'D HEARD WHAT YOU SAID THAT THAT'S BEYOND OUR CAN HERE -- BUT HOW DO WE INFLUENCE AT THAT. SO WHAT IS IT IS WITH WITH THE ACTUAL FORM LIKE WE CAN'T CUT IT IT'S ONLY AND ACCORDING TO US CENSUS BUREAU IT'S GOING TO BE. IN SIMPLIFIED CHINESE YEAH THAT'S ALL. AROUND ME [inaudible] THE PHARMACY [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] THERE ARE. US CENSUS IS DOING [inaudible] QUESTION [inaudible] LATER. AND THEN PART [inaudible] WE CAN [inaudible] STATE AGENCY YOU TALK ABOUT WATER EVEN IN THE VERY VERY GRASS THAT ARE -- THAT IS YEAH YEAH YEAH. REGARDING WHAT THE US CENSUS HAS DECIDED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO OKAY. SO YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND THE TRIGGERS OF OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA RIVER -- REQUIRE OUR CONTRACTORS -- AND SO WE JUST GET THROUGH IS RECORDED WITH THE QUESTIONS SO THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE GOT FEEDBACK WHICH WAS ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A REQUIREMENT WHERE DOES THAT FIT IN. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A MEMBER TO HAD SAID WHAT ARE THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS SINCE NOVEMBER SINCE RE RELEASED. THE STRATEGIC PLAN REQUIREMENT SECTION ONE POINT FOUR AND SECTION ONE ONE ONE POINT SIX SIX ONE POINT FOUR WAS A QUESTION ASSISTANCE CENTERS WHICH AGAIN IS A CENTERING PIECE YOU GOT TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. AND YOU GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THE RIGHT LANGUAGES WHETHER BE SIMPLIFIED OR WHAT HAVE YOU AT THE RIGHT TIME TO GET THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE WERE SO LIMITED WITH WHAT THE CENSUS BUREAU IS OFFERING US. IN ORDER TO ANSWER -- SO WE REQUIRE WE'RE REQUIRING ALL OF OUR CONTRACTORS TO IDENTIFY THEIR QUESTIONS SYSTEM CENTERS AND THEY CAN DO THAT FROM THE HARD TO COME OUT. LIKE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT GONNA PUT A QUESTION IS IS THAT ARE IN THE SACK WHERE I LIVE THE SART ACCOUNT. SO THEY HAVE THOSE MAPS AND SO WE'RE WE ARE REGIONAL COMMANDERS ARE WORKING WITH THEM. THAT SECTION ONE POINT FOR THE SECTION ONE POINT SIX WAS IS LANGUAGE ACCESS WHEN THE LAVA COUNTRIES LIKE I'M NOT SURE IT IS TO DO WE'RE COMING OUT WITH ADDITIONAL. GUIDANCE WHICH IS TELL US WHAT LANGUAGES YOU'RE GONNA PUT THOSE QUESTIONNAIRES ISN'T CENTERS AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ACCESS IN THE LANGUAGE AT THE RIGHT TIME IN THE RIGHT PLACE STEP BY THE RIGHT EOPLE. AND THAT'S WHERE OUR COMMITTEE BASED GROUPS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM COME FORTH TO BE ABLE TO SAY I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS COMMUNITY AND THAT COMMUNITY AND I AM GOING TO BE ABLE MISSING I'M A PREVIOUS GROUP IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THAT OUR REAH THAT'S WHY THE MORE JORDY OF OUR DOLLARS ARE GOING OUT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES GROUPS SO THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FOR THE STRATEGIC PLAN ELEMENTS OF REQUIREMENT THAT'S COMING UP TO DO. MAY JUNE -- THE NEXT STEPS WE HAVE OR LANGUAGE DATA WHICH WE CONTROL THESE -- INTO INTO A SPREAD SHEETS WERE TO PUBLISH THAT ON OUR WEBSITE I HAVE SOME OF IT THEY'RE PRETTY LONG SPREADSHEETS BY COUNTY. ARE A MYSTERY CBO'S AND COUNTIES ARE GOING TO IDENTIFY THOSE QVC LOCATIONS WITH THE LANGUAGE SUPPORT CAPACITY TO INCLUDE IN THEIR STRATEGIC PLANS THAT WE GET THAT SOME REALLY BE LIKE. I KNOW I NEED SOMETHING HERE BUT I CAN'T STOP IT. AND SO THAT'S ABOUT HOW WE COORDINATOR I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A RESOURCE RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW IN JUNE BUT THAT'S WHAT JUNE JULY AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER ABOUT. IS MAKING SURE IN DURING OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WORKSHOPS THEY WERE BRINGING THE RIGHT FOLKS TO TO FILL THOSE SPOTS TO PROVIDE THAT ACCESS. SO RPM'S AND CONTRACTORS ARE GOING TO IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS AGAIN DO WE HAVE GAPS -- AND THEN OR LANGUAGE EDUCATION ACCESS PLAN THE WRITTEN ONE WILL BE OUT ON THE SEVENTEENTH BUT WE DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT BECAUSE THE DATA IS OUT THERE. AND WITH THE MAPS ARE OUT THERE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR SHE PLANTS. SO WITH THAT I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY SOME QUESTIONS PROBABLY SOME TECHNICAL ONES THAT I'M NOT ABLE TO ANSWER BUT HOW TO MOTIVATE US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SEMI BERMAN I KNOW YOU HAD CAME AND THEY DID YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME. INITIAL REMARKS FIRST BEFORE YOU LAUNCH INTO THE QUESTIONS I I DON'T THINK SO I THINK IT'S A NUMBER -- TWO KINDA YEAH GRAB MY REMARKS AND ENDING CORPORATE OF THOSE AND HIS -- JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YEAH -- ABILITY TOHAVE A DEEP DIVE ON IT WHAT'S WHAT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF CONCERNS AND FEEDBACK FROM FROM OUR COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT. AND ALL SAVE OTHER QUESTIONS. FOR THE PROCESS OKAY SO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY ROOM THIS SUMMER KAMLAGER-DOVE. THE GIANTS FOR OPENING UP THE HORNET'S NEST EARLIER. BUT I THINK IT BEGS THE QUESTION TRULY ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY I MEAN THERE ARE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS ARE SPOKEN IN LA UNIFIED. AND THAT SHOULD BE AN INDICATION -- YOU KNOW ON ITS OWN THAT HOW WE TACKLE THIS ISSUE -- NEEDS TO BE REALLY THOUGHTFUL AND EXPANSIVE BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS AND FACT ARE COMING OR COMING FROM OUR LIVING IN HARD TO COUNT. COMMUNITIES -- AND SO MEETING THEM WHERE THEY ARE EITHER THROUGH THE WORK WITH THE COUNTY OR DO THE WORK WITH THE A. CBO'S WILL BE CRITICAL -- AND RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NON WRITTEN LANGUAGES THAT ARE USED IN WRITTEN LANGUAGES. AND WHERE THAT MEDIUM IS SO CONTINUED KIND OF THOUGHT ON THAT IS -- WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME AND LA COUNTY IS GONNA BE PRESENTING AT THE EXPENSE OF OKAY. SO ACTUALLY -- I HAD SOME QUESTIONS WHY CLEAR FACTS A IN TERMS OF YOUR TESTIMONY THE FIRST OF ALL AND I KNOW THAT. SIMILAR TO RAN THROUGH A WHOLE BUNCH OF QUESTIONS I WANNA LOOP BACK AROUND TO CLARIFY -- SO WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME COUNTIES IN A CBO'S THAT THEY DID THAT THEY FELT. WELL THEY THEY EXPRESS THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW THERE'D BE ADDITIONAL. REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON THEM. RELATED WHEN THEY WERE OFFERED THE FUNDS ARE DISPLAYED FOR THE R. F. P.. SO -- REGARDING THE ON THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PIECE CAN CAN YOU [inaudible] SO IS. SO IS SO BASICALLY. I'M HEARING A BIT OF AN EXPECTATION OF OKAY WE WAITING FOR THE LANGUAGE PLAN WHICH DOES COME OUT IN MAY. YOU MENTIONED THERE IS DATA OUT THERE SO IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS IN THE R. F. P. ITSELF AN EXPECTATION FOR ALL THE PEOPLE SIGNED UP AND NOW YOU'VE SELECTED. OUR DAY SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE LANGUAGE ACCESS WITH THE RESOURCES THAT YEAR -- THAT THEY APPLIED FOR OUR DAY GOING TO GET ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ARE WAS THE EXPECTATIONS LOOK THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE FEW WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU HAD TO DO FOR THE MONEY YOU GOT AND YOU PRIDE IN READ WELL ENOUGH SO ARE I DON'T KNOW. IN ONE POINT FOUR INSTEAD OKAY ONE POINT SIX SIX ONE POINT FOUR IS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCES AND IT CLEARLY SAYS LAY OUT YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE ASSISTANCE CENTERS NOW IF THEY DECIDED THEY WERE GONNA ONLY DO IN ENGLISH. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE SECTION ONE POINT ONE IS WHO ARE YOUR HARD TO COUNT AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE HARD TO COUNT. RIGHT YOU GOT IT THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST THING IF YOU'RE GONNA APPLY FOR THESE DOLLARS YOU BETTER KNOW WHERE YOUR HEART ACCOUNT IS HERE OUR MAPS. SECTION ONE POINT SIX WAS CLEARLY LANGUAGE -- AND CAN A LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS PLAN AND IT LAID OUT TELL US WHAT STRATEGIES ARE GOING TO USE TO MEET THOSE FOLKS WHO. ARE NOT NOT ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT SO IT'S BEEN IN THERE SINCE NOVEMBER. LET ME JUST CLARIFY THIS THAT AND SO WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT YOU ASK THE APPLICANT'S QUESTIONS AND ASSUME THEY PROVIDED ANSWERS UNDER APPLICATION. THAT YOU COULD REFER. TO DATE BUT AND ALSO THE A CB ES YEAH AND THE C. B.. OKAY IN CVS. WHAT I'M NOT CLEAR ON IS THE DO YOU SAY EXPLICITLY IN ORDER THAT YOU WILL SO YOU SAID WELL WHAT'S% YOUR PLAN AND I DON'T? KNOW I EIGHT SECTION TODAY YEAH AND AND SO. THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAY THEY WERE GOING TO DO THIS WITH EXISTING MONEY AND THEIR RESPONSES OR DID YOU ARE AT SOME PLACE AND THE OUR FEE IT SAYS THE EXPECTATION IS IS THAT. IN YOUR PLAN THAT YOU PROPOSE YOU WILL COVER ALL OF THE LANGUAGES THE YOU KNOW AS YOU DESCRIBED HERE THAT MEET THOSE TRIGGER POINTS OR WHATEVER RIGHTS I JUST WANT TO GET CLARIFICATION ABOUT THAT DIDN'T PROVIDE TRIGGER POINTS BUT WE DIDN'T GO IT WE DIDN'T EXPECT WE DIDN'T GET. ANY PLANS AT SAID WE'RE ONLY GOING TO DO ENGLISH BECAUSE RIGHT BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WE'RE ONLY GOING TO DO ENGLISH AND DO YOU GOT TO COVER HOWEVER X. NUMBER OF LANGUAGES THAT MEET. THOSE STANDARDS AND YOU CAN HAVE A LOT THERE'S A LOT SPACE BETWEEN THAT POINT AND THAT POINT. AND AGAIN I'M NOT THE ONE WHO REVIEWED ALL THE APPLICATIONS BUT WHAT I HEARD YOU JUST SAY IS YOU POSE PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS THAT THEY NEED TO ANSWER IN YOUR APPLICATIONS IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY WROTE AND APPLICATIONS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE -- TO THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BASICALLY COVER ALL THE LANGUAGES THAT. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T EXPLICITLY EXPRESSED TO TRIGGER POINTS I AND I'M JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR EXPECTATION BECAUSE I DON'T WANT IN THE END. RIGHT THOSE WERE TRYING TO BUILD THIS AIRPLANE IS KIND OF FLIGHT ELEVEN MONTHS. IS THAT. YEAH WILLIAM ONE SHOT AT THIS AND SO -- IT FOR EVERY TEN YEARS AND SO. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THAT MORE JUST ENGLISH BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY ONLY HAVE. SIX LANGUAGES IN YOUR TRIGGER POINTS ARE FOR YOU KNOW TWENTY RIGHT. WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WHAT HAPPENS. SO WITH OTHERS YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE THERE'S COUNTIES WHO RAN THERE'S COUNTIES THEY APPLIED IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO OFTEN THEY DON'T OFTEN. CLEARLY IN THE PLANET SAID TELL US WHAT YOUR LANGUAGE ACCESS CAPABILITIES ARE FOR THE BASED ON WHO YOU'RE HARD TO COUNT OUR SO IF. I AND AGAIN THEY LAID THOSE OUT WE CAN SHOW YOU THOSE BUT THEIR STRATEGIC PLANS ARE DUE TILL MAY THIRTIETH AND SO THEY WERE LOOKING FOR US TO HAVE ADDITIONAL -- ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO AND WHAT TRIGGERS THAT WAS SO SO BASICALLY. THEIR STRATEGIC PLANS DO AND MAY THIRTIETH BUT YOU'RE NOT COMING OUT WITH YOUR PLAN UNTIL MAY SEVENTEENTH WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM OKAY IDENTIFY THOSE IN GETTING THEIR INPUT WE MET WITH OVER THIRTY ONE DIFFERENT ADVOCATES. AND COUNTIES IN PUBLIC IN TERMS OF GETTING THE FEEDBACK WE PUT OUT STANDARDS AND SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT CAME BACK FROM ADVOCATES WAS WE WANT REQUIREMENTS. YOU NEED TO REQUIRE SO WE SAID OKAY WILL WE GOT A REQUIRE THESE AGAIN THIS IS TWO YEAR WE DO STANDARDS WHICH IS KIND OF DOWN HERE OR DO WE REQUIRE DO REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS MUCH MORE CLOSER TO A MANDATE. SO THAT'S THE COUNTIES ON THE A CBO'S THEY DID APPLYING AND THERE WERE A NUMBER DIFFERENT CBO'S AND THEY SHOWED THEIR LANGUAGE SKILLS BASED AND THEIR COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATION ORGANIZING SKILLS. AND COVERAGE OF IT AGAIN THEIR STRATEGIC PLANS BECAUSE WE CHOSE THEM BECAUSE THEY SHOW THAT THEY HAD PROMISE. OR DO A LATER IN JULY JUNE JULY. SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THEMTO IDENTIFY BECAUSE WE GOTTA MASH THE COUNTIES -- AND THE A. CBO'S TO GET THAT COVERAGE IDENTIFY GAPS ARE NOT GOING TO BE DONE IN A VACUUM OR SUB OKAY SO I APPRECIATE YOU ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR CAPACITIES. I THINK PERHAPS PART OF THE REASON YOU'RE HEARING A LITTLE BIT AND AGAIN I'M NOTYELLED FROM PEOPLE ABOUT REQUIREMENTS IS IS THAT. SO PEOPLE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES. DO THEY ALL ADD UP. SUFFICIENTLY TO ACHIEVE. THE STANDARD THAT YOU'VE PUT OUT HERE I MEAN BECAUSE AND IN THE END -- YEAH PEOPLE MAY HAVE VARYING CAPACITIES AND I SURE YOU PICK PEOPLE WHO HAVE GREATER CAPACITIES BUT EVEN THAT AND THAT'S ALSO THE TEN OUR RESOURCES. SO THE QUESTION IS IS THAT. IN IN THE END ARE WE GOING TO HAVE. PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WHO CAN ACTION TO THOSE WHO HAVE THE LANGUAGE CAPACITY TO MEET THE VERY. DIVERSE NEEDS OF I CALIFORNIA RANGING FROM LOS ANGELES WITH ALL THE LANGUAGE HAS THAT YOU HEARD. SACRAMENTO I'M HEARING FROM PEOPLE THEY'RE VERY WORRIED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR DAY WON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT YOU HAVE ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND THOSE ARE VERY TWO VERY IMPORTANT LANGUAGES -- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES OUT THERE -- FOR VARIETY DIFFERENT GROUPS AND I'LL TELL YOU THE API COMMUNITY I'M HEARING A LOT OF CONCERN THAT. NAME THEIR LANGUAGES WILL BE YOURSELF THAT SOMEONE'S NOT THERE. WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. SO WE CAN YOU GUARANTEE ME TOO ME THAT SOMEBODY WILL BE THERE -- TO TO TO HELP THEM OUT SO THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE LET TO NEARBY TO ME BECAUSE WE DID A AMENDMENT TO THE RP FOR THEY CBO'S WE REQUIRE THE TOP SIX LANGUAGES. AND THE FEEDBACK WE GOT WAS THE TOP SIX LANGUAGES WOULDN'T. INCLUDE THE SMALLER LINGUISTIC COMMUNITIES -- BUT IT DID COVER IN SMALLER COUNTIES IT MADE THEM. THE COULD BARELY GET TO THE TOP SIX BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE. A TOP SIX LANGUAGE SO NEVADA COUNTY AND SIERRA -- THEY DO SPANISH BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR BREAKDOWN OF LANGUAGES IT GOES DOWN. TO YOU KNOW [inaudible] THE PHARMACY. GOES DOWN. TO ELEVEN PEOPLE SPEAKING GERMAN. OKAY THOUGHT WHAT WITH THE OKAY ALL RIGHT BUT BUT LET'S THE BUT WE HAVE LARGER COUNTIES YEAH. RIGHT AND SO THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT THE SMALL AREA AS WAS SMALLER COUNTY OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE THERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THEY REALIZE THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW. THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE COVERS MANY LANGUAGES. BUT YOU CAN'T SAY WELL BECAUSE WHICH COUNTY WHICH COUNTY YOU TALK TO VETERANS YES YOU DID BECAUSE SUTTER BASICALLY IF YOU GO DOWN THE SIX AND ELEVEN PEOPLE THAT YOU APPLY THE SAME STANDARD TO SACRAMENTO OR CERTAINLY TO LA. RIGHT THAT'S WHY WE DID THESE NEW TERMS BECAUSE ORIGINALLY THE TOP SIX WOULDN'T AND IT WAS ACTION THAT WAS LOW IT'S WHEN THEY'RE THE TOP SIX WASN'T EQUITABLE SO WE WENT BACK AND DID OUR RESEARCH. AND THAT'S WHY WE TOOK LA OUT OF THE MIX BECAUSE IT SKEWS IT AND WE TOOK THE MEDIAN OF THOSE FORTY GEOGRAPHIC WERE RE DUG DEEPER WITH THE MICRA DATA FROM. HOMES AND WE LOOKED AT IT AND WE SAID FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND IS THE MEDIAN AND EVERYBODY. THIS IS OF THAT -- SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS IS THAT THAT'S WHY I THINK PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WATER REQUIREMENTS RIGHT I MEAN SO I HEAR IS THAT YOU ASK PEOPLE TO DESCRIBE THE CAPACITY. AND THAT'S GREAT. AND I UNDER THAT RIGHT BUT IN THE END [inaudible] WHEN CENSUS? DAY COMES OUR SENSES MONTH APRIL. TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED TO BE SURE THE PEOPLE ARE PLACED AT LEAST MEET THE STANDARDS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED HERE TODAY AND CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF THE IF IT TURNS OUT THE TOWNIES AND THE AC VEAS AND I REALIZE THERE'S A BIT OF INTERWEAVING. ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET THAT STANDARD AND WE KNOW THIS IS THIS WE'RE HEADING INTO IT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO FILL IN THAT GAP BEFORE CENSUS DAY HAPPENS. SO WE ARE YOU KNOW LESS THAN A YEAR OUT. OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE THE COUNTIES AND THE CBO IS DO YOU HAVE THAT CAPACITY I CAN'T. LOOK AT MY COST BY HAVE TO ASK THEM DO YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY IN YOUR PLANNING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THAT CAPACITY BUT THEY HAVE TO START WITH WHERE THE MAP IS AND WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE. AND AS WE IDENTIFY THOSE THEN WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO OTHER PRIVATE FUNDING IS THE GOVERNOR'S CHIEF OF STAFF SAID WE EXPECT PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS TO PUT DOLLARS UP FRONT. TO FOR SOME OF THOSE MAJOR SMALLER LANGUAGES THAT ARE COVERED OKAY SO I A SCIENCE SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT I'M HEARING NOW IS THAT BECAUSE THE OTHER PART THAT'S GOING ON HERE THAT I THINK. MOST OF THE MEMBERS THE COMMUTER WHERE'S WE'RE GOING TO OUR BUDGET PROCESS RATES MAY WILL HAVE MAY REVISE AND PROBABLY COUPLE WEKS. AND THEN WILL PROVE A BUDGETS -- HOPEFULLY SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR BEFORE THE END OF JUNE -- SO BUT WHAT YOU JUST WHAT YOU JUST SAID IN MY CLEAR FIVE BE SURE THAT I HEARD IT CORRECTLY. THAT THE EXPECTATION IS IS THAT IF THAT WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS PLANNING IF THERE IS A GAP. THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS THE FIND THE RESOURCES TO COVER THAT GAP. I'M GAS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT COUNTY TO COUNTY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT A TOP LANGUAGE THAT'S OVER IT IN THEIR TOP ONE AND IT MAY NOT BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY I MEAN MAYBE AMONG IS ON THEIR TOP. 3% AND ABOVE BUT IS IT'S BELOW IN TERMS OF SACRAMENTO THEY HAVE THAT COVERAGE WE WANT TO MARRY THEM UP TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR DOING THAT CAN PROVIDE THE TRANSLATED MATERIALS AND SHARE THOSE. WILL BE SHARING ACROSS COUNTIES OKAY APPRECIATE SHARING. BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO BE SURE WE PROVIDE THAT LANGUAGE ACCESS I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND I AND MY COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES RIGHT NOW I'M NOT FEELING PARTICULARLY CONFIDENT FOR SOME REASON. I WANT TO AND HAVE THE REASSURED THAT WE WILL CLOSE THAT GAP BY APRIL. TWENTY TWENTY AND I DON'T DECIDE REALIZE THAT YOU SO I MEAN IT'S GREAT YOU'RE ASKING PEOPLE OUT-CAPACITY. BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I WANNA BE SURE AM OF PUTTING A LOT OF RESOURCES INTO THIS. AND OTHER HEARING BACK FROM PEOPLE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY AND ALSO THAT THERE MAY BE INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES. RIGHT OR THERE COULD BE ENOUGH RESOURCES THE FACT OF THE MATTER TO STAR JUSTIN HOW OUR GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY SO WE HAVE AN AND I'M PRESIDENT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ALREADY DEDICATED TO THIS EFFORT. AND AS WE GO THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT GAPS WHERE WE NEED MANY MORE MONEY I CAN'T TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. IF I NEED MORE MONEY OR IF WE IF WE HAVE ENUGH MONEY IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE AT THE STAGE WHERE WE'RE AT WE WILL NOT GET DOWN TO THAT LEVEL UNTIL WE'VE. FINISHED REALLY IN PARTICULARLY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION WORKSHOPS OVER THE SUMMER THAT'S WHERE WE'LL FIND THOSE GAPS THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW THE WHOLE INTENT. AND PURPOSE OF THE ART P. IN AS DEEP AS MENTIONED IS. EVERYTHING I CAME BACK FROM OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. WHO PUT AND PROPOSALS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO IDENTIFY WHAT TEIR LANGUAGE ACCESS PLANS ARE GOING TO BE FOR THE TOP SIX LANGUAGES AND THEIR REGION -- NOT ALL OF THEM DID THAT SO NOW TO COMBAT UPON US WITHIN THE CENSUS OFFICE AND OUR REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS TO TO TAKE WHAT THEY STARTED. AND N MOLD NEEDED TO BE WHICH IS TAKE THEIR DOLLARS AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO THE LOCATIONS. FOR A FOR PROVIDING THAT LEVEL OF LANGUAGE ACCESS ASSISTANCE AND THOSE LOW IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THOSE QUESTIONNAIRE SYSTEM CENTERS. NEED TO BE SUB THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING AS WE FINALIZE STRATEGIC PLANS AND THEN AS WE HEAD INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION WE GET INTO MORE GRANULAR DETAIL WHEN WHEN WE KNOW THIS THEN PUT WHEN WILL YOU FINISH THIS IS SAID. IN JULY INTIMIDATION LANNING WORKSHOPS YES WE'RE DOING APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM. COMMON THERE ARE HAVE DATA DAY LONG WORKSHOPS AND SO THEY GO THROUGH SEPTEMBER JUST BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO THEM ONE DAY AT ONE OR THE OTHER BECAUSE OF TRAVEL. OKAY WORKSHOPS ARE GREAT BUT WHEN WILL WE KNOW WHAT THE GAP IS ARE WE DONE I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE A GAP THAT'S GREAT. TO IMPLEMENTATION PLANS OR DO IN ORDER FOR THE CONTRACTORS TO GET THEIR REST THE MAJORITY OF THEIR DOLLARS -- WEDNESDAY OCTOBER FIRST AND OCTOBER FIFTEENTH AND SO THAT'S ONE WHAT WE'LL BE DOING THE GAP WE'RE DOING THE GAP ANALYSIS AS WE GO SOME REGIONS ARE FURTHER ALONG SOME. REGIONS CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY HOW MUCH THEY'RE CBO'S ARE GONNA SPEND PER PERSON. OKAY SAID UNTO OVER -- SO BASICALLY BY MID OCTOBER. WHAT THE HAVE THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS IN? AND IF YOU DEBT IF I GAPS WE SHOULD BE IDENTIFYING GAPS ALONG THE WAY RIGHT SO THEY'RE THERE FOR THEIR SPREAD OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER MONTHS SO RIGHT BE WILL BE HITTING EACH REGION AND WAVES AND STARTING WITH OKAY. AWAY DOWNTURN STATES. I THINK LA IS PROBABLY THE LAST ONE SO. SO SO YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK TO US BY MID OCTOBER THE STATUS. OF LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR THE CENSUS IN CALIFORNIA. WELL WE CAN REPORT BACK ON A ROLLING BASIS AS WE CLOSE OUT ON IMPLEMENTATION PLANS FOR VERY OKAY BUT WE'VE BUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE FOR THE WHOLE STATE WE SHOULD COMPLETE THAT BY MID OCTOBER. YEAH YES SHOULD AND THOSE COUNTIES IN A CBO'S CAN COME AND TESTIFY TO THE WET WEATHER MISSING. A AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM FILL [inaudible] TO OKAY. IT'S JUST ONE SOME DEADLINES. OKAY WE MAY FIGHT WE WILL TRY I WANNA OF WELL WE CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE A ROLLING UPDATE CERTAINLY WOULD. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. BECAUSE IN CASE WE DO NEED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. ARE WE NEED RESOURCES OR WHATEVER ELSE NOT TO SAY. A LOT OF THE OF THE CHURCH. HAVE THOSE TYPE THE DISK DISCUSSIONS AT ANY NUYS THE BUDGET IS -- COMING TOGETHER ON WHAT ARE SOME TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY -- PUT INTO PLACE WE NEED TO HAVE GAP COVERAGE OKAY NOW IS AGAIN I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM SOME OF THE COUNTIES AND THE CBO'S THAT -- THAT YEAH THEY FELT LIKE THAT THEY WE'RE NOT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE NOT CLEAR SO I THINK THAT I'M HOPING THAT THAT WILL GET RESOLVED AS WELL. THAT'S A YES OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT -- QUESTION SIT AT YOUR SYSTEM MEMORY MISS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN SOME OF OUR RESEARCHERS YOU'RE DOING IT AND REACHING OUT A LOT ABOUT THE COUNTIES IN THE CITY'S BEING ABLE COME FORWARD. WHAT ARE YOU ALSO REACHING OUT -- TO TRAVEL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO GET THEIR INPUT OF HOW BEST TO MAKE SURE THE CENSUS IS BEING DONE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ALSO. YES OF LAST YEAR WE HELD. THREE LESTER THREE TRIBAL CONSULTATIONS NORTH SOUTH AND CENTRAL -- TO GET THEIR INPUT ABOUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO ENGAGE THEM WE HAVE A TROUBLE -- UGH A TRIBAL LAYS SOMEONE AND DOING ADDITIONAL THREE OF TROUBLE CONSULTATIONS LATER I WOULD SAY. SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CALENDAR -- BUT WE'RE ALSO AND ENGAGING TROUBLE GOVERNMENT'S WE'VE ALSO FUNDED -- CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN VOTES PROJECT -- FORTY THOUSAND TO DO STATEWIDE OUTREACH AND ALSO -- CALIFORNIA INDIAN MANPOWER CORPORATION LORETTA SANCHEZ ALSO A FORTY THOUSAND GRANTS TO HELP DO STATEWIDE OUTREACH USING THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR THE BRING IN THAT DATA BACK I GUESS AS FAR AS THE THE THE CHAIRS ASKING TO AS FAR AS BRINGING THAT BACK WHILE. THINGS ARE BEING ROLLED OUT ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AN UPDATE AS FAR AS A OUR REGION MAYBE SOME AREAS THAT WERE MISSING. WITHIN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ALSO. I THINK SO WHERE DID DEVELOPING IN THIS IS THE OF THE TECHNOLOGY PIECE THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN STATEWIDE OUTREACH AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT ON WE'RE PARTNERING -- WITH A ORGANIZATION YOU GUYS ARE PROBABLY ALL FAMILIAR WITH HAVING RUN CAMPAIGNS -- PDI TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT DATA TO ACTUALLY SEE. ARE THE KNOCKING ON DOORS DID THEY GO TO AN EVENT HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT THEY TOUCH KNOW WHAT MEETINGS WHERE WERE THEY AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO MAP WHERE THEY ARE BECAUSE AGAIN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE MAP JUST NOT JUST A DISTRICT. TO TRY TO MEASURE ARE WE LOW IS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU KNOW DO WE NOT GET ENOUGH FEEDBACK AND THEN WHEN THE ACTUAL RESPONSE TIME COMES FROM. MARCH FIFTEENTH THROUGH JULY FIFTEENTH WATCHING SELF RESPONSE RATES FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU TO SEE OKAY THIS IS WHERE WE INVEST OUR DOLLARS IS WHERE THEY'RE DOING EVENTS. IS THE RESPONSE LOW OR HIGH AND DO WE NEED TO INCREASE YOU KNOW FOCUSED OUT REGION THAT AREA DURING THE RESPONSE TIME. SO WE'RE HOPING TO START START TO IMPLEMENT THE SUMMER THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY PIECE BILL NOTED THAT SOME AN AREA OF THE HARD TO COUNT. AND WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT THE FINANCIAL GAPS AND LOOKING TOWARDS -- SOME OF THOSE FINANCIAL -- AREAS THAT ARE THERE AND AND WHERE THOSE GAPS ARE AT LOOKING AT SOME PRIVATE FUNDING IN THOSE THINGS BUT I THINK STILL WE SEE THE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE NUCLEUS THERE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING ADEQUATE COUNT. IN TROUBLE -- GOVERNMENT SO WHEN HE DOES COME BACK TO THIS -- JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE HAD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM THOSE FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO TO TESTIFY AS FAR AS WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT WHAT IS IT. A B. GRADE AND I MISTER WHEN WE COME BACK THE CONTRACTORS THAT WE'VE ENGAGED WOULD HAVE A GOOD PLAN -- IN TERMS OF MEDIA I UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATE WIDE MEDIA ARE A FEW WILL BE AWARDED TOLD JUNE WHAT'S IS THAT IS. IN IN THE PLAN THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT IN MAY. CAN YOU CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK A LITTLE BIT THIS IS THE SCOPE OF THE PLAN IS IT GOING TO DEAL WITH MEDIA. IS OR IS IT JUST FOCUSED ON THE COUNTIES IN THE A CBO'S -- SO WHAT WHAT. IMPACT ACTUALLY THAT I BELIEVE THE THE THE THE LANGUAGE FAILS THAT'S COME OUT BEFORE THIS HEARING THAT'S WHAT WE TIME THE HEARING TO BE ACTUALLY AFTER. THE PLAN CAME OUT CLEAR THE PLAN IS NOT YET ALTID STILL COUPLE WEEKS OUT HE SPEAKS TO THE SCOPE OF THE A PLAN THAT WE SHOULD DISSIPATE -- SEEING IN ON MAY SEVENTEENTH. RIGHT SO THE MEAT WHILE THE THE MEDIA OR P. WE JUST COULD CLOSED pA NUMBER OF RESPONSES AND SO WE'RE BEGINNING OUR EVALUATION EVALUATION PROCESS. ON THAT BUT THE SKIPPER THERE IF YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT LATELY BUT IT DOES INCLUDE BOTH A SORT OF OVERALL STRATEGIC. OVERVIEW FOR COMMUNICATIONS INCLUDES -- CONNECTING WITH EARNED MEDIA IT INCLUDES CONNECTING WITH ALL OF OUR CONTRACTORS TO COURTNEY WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME COUNTIES THAT THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON MEDIA -- IT FOCUSES ON BRANDING I MEAN IT HAS THE WHOLE. LIKE KITCHEN SINK FULL OF STUFF THAT THEY'LL BE DOING -- TO CREATE THAT SURROUND SOUND BUT FOR ME. THE GOAL FOR OUR COMMUNICATIONS PLAN OR MEDIA PLAN IS TO DRIVE PEOPLE TO THIS QUESTION -- ASSISTANCE CENTERS TO DRIVE THEM TO EITHER SELF RESPOND ON THEIR PHONES ARE ON THEIR COMPUTERS OR TO DRIVE THEM TO AREAS WHERE THEY CAN GET THE HELP SO FOR EXAMPLE IN. TWENTY TEN AND IN -- TWO THOUSAND A LOT OF THE JUST TAKE IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THEY HAD QUESTION YOUR SYSTEM CENTERS THEY DID OF THROUGH -- CALIFORNIA BIKE MEDIA WE DID ONE PAGE YOU KNOW HUGE INSERTS IN THEIR PUBLICATIONS WHERE THEY PUT. HERE'S THE LOCATION OF IT HERE THE HOURS THAT THEY'RE OPEN AND WE DROPPED HIM OFF AT ALL AT THE CHURCHES. OF IN OTHER AREAS WHERE PEOPLE GET THEM WE EXPECT OTHER ETHNIC MEDIA TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE UP QUESTION YOUR ASSISTANCE CENTERS THAT ARE YOU TO RUN BY THE CBO IS OF THE COUNTIES. INSERTED INTO THAT ETHIC MEDIA SO PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO GO AND THAT'S PART OF YOUR V. D. R. E. YES OKAY AND AND ACTUALLY THE OTHER PART THE QUESTION WHICH YOU HAVE ANSWERED YET IS SO FOR THE MAY SEVENTEENTH LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN THE ONE THAT WE WERE EXPECTING YET. FOR THIS HEARING. WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THAT PARTICULAR -- REPORT GOING TO ENCOMPASSES IT DOES INCLUDE MEET THE LANGUAGE ASPECT OF MEDIA AS IT JUST FOCUSED ON THE COUNTIES IN THE A CBO ACTIVITIES. CAN JUST SPEAK TO WHAT WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING ON MAY SEVENTEENTH IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL. TO EXPECT IN THAT DOCUMENT I REALIZE THE DETAILS ARE STILL BEING WORKED OUT THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT OUT YET BUT WHAT WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THAT PARTICULAR DOCUMENT THE FOCUS WILL BE ON OUR CONTRACTORS THAT'S THE MEDIA -- CONTRACT IS STILL OUT FOR BID WE WANT TO WAIT TILL THAT COMES IN AND THEN WILL PROVIDE THAT SIMPLY TO THEM BECAUSE IT'S ONE CONTRACTOR. BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO HOLD THAT UP ALL IN TERMS OF THE COUNTY IN THE C. B. AS IN THE CBO. SO THAT MAY SEVENTEENTH LANGUAGE ACCESS PLANS JUST FOCUSED ON THE THE CBO'S AND COUNTIES OR THE GROUND PART OF THE ACTIVITIES OKAY. AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS IS THAT -- SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE TRIGGER. LANGUAGES HOWEVER I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- LEAST OUTSIDE OF LA COUNTY EVEN WITH LA COUNTY WERE AT 96% IT'S ONE EIGHT NINETY ONE POINT 3% SO THAT'S STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S A BIG STATE WHO STILL AREN'T COVERED. ARE THERE ANY EXPECTATIONS THAT. ARE A C. B. AS DO ANYTHING TO TRY TO COVER THAT REMAINING NINE PERCENT'S. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BRIDGE THE GAP -- ON ON THAT THINKING ABOUT SOME ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES -- TO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO I THINK THAT WE JUST YOU HAVE TO LOOK CLOSER THE DATA WHAT ARE THOSE ACTUAL LANGUAGES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE IN ROADS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE KIND OF LIKE SWISS GERMAN AND SO THOSE ONES YOU COULD PROBABLY. YOU KNOW THE WAY I SEE THE SOME OF THOSE LANGUAGES ARE GOING TO BE HIT NOT SPECIFICALLY THE LANGUAGE ACCESS THEY MAYBE HAD THROUGH SECTOR OUT REACH MAYBE HIT THERE ARE K. THROUGH TWELVE OR EDUCATIONAL AVERAGE. THE BABY HAD THROUGH OUR STATEWIDE OUTREACH SO. BUT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE. TWO OKAY WELL I I HOPE THAT THIS ITEM BE THERE MAY BE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES OTHER THAN SIMPLY PROVIDING GET OUT THAT LANGUAGE IT CETERA WHEN YOU LOOK AT BUT I HOPE THAT THERE IS A STRATEGY AN EXPECTATION THAT THERE SOME FORM OF OUT REACH. TO THOSE POPULATIONS BECAUSE OF THE RACE BASICALLY YOU'VE WRITTEN OFF TRYING TO GET ABOUT 9% OR EIGHT EIGHT POINT. 7% OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS NOT HOUSEHOLDS SO WE'RE NOT SURE IF THERE'S A HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD THAT MAY SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OR ENGLISH. SO THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THE DATA -- THAT WE HAVE TO DIG DEEPER IN DEBT AND I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT SOMETIMES WELL CERTAINLY ENGLISH'S SERVE THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND AND THIS. STATE SOME SOME OF THE OTHER LANGUAGES DEPENDING FOR EXAMPLE AND IF IT COULD BE THAT THEY MAY ACTUALLY NO NOT A T. I. LANGUAGE. THAT THAT MAY BE THE LINKING LANGUAGE SHOULD NOT ALWAYS ENGLISH IS BEING THE LANGUAGE MY MY DRIVE PEOPLE TO GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE US CENSUS WILL BE IN SOME OTHER LANGUAGES SO. YES -- SUMMER READY JONES SAWYER. HI IN IT. ANGIE YOU BROUGHT UP THE COMMUNICATION -- ASPECT IN AND AND I'M TRYING TO GET A GET A FEELING OF HOW FLEXIBLE THAT IS. IN THAT ARE PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS JUST BY EXAMPLE -- YES YOU MAY BE WORKING WITH THE LOS ANGELES SENTINEL WHICH IS AFTER AMERICAN NEWSPAPER IN LOS ANGELES -- AND YES THEY HAVE A REGULAR CIRCULATION BUT THEY ALSO HAVE -- SOME CALLED CASE TO SEOUL WHICH HAS ABOUT A HALF A MILLION AFTER AMERICANS MANY OF WHOM ARE IN MISS CALM WATERS DISTRICT -- FROM MY DISTRICT THAT SHOW UP -- BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DRIVING HIM. TO A CERTAIN PLACE AS OPPOSED. TO YOU NOW HAVE A HALF A MILLION AFRICAN AMERICANS IN ONE SPOT. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL THEM LEAVE HERE. TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO DO THE SENSES WHEN YOU COULD HAVE A CAPTURED GROUP OF PEOPLE RIGHT THERE. AND THEN HAVE CENTS WHATEVER THESE PEOPLE CALL THERE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT AS THIS. MEDIA PLAN THAT THAT FLEXIBLE ROBUST ENOUGH OR IS IT. YOU HAVE TO DO AN AT AND THAT'S IT ARE YOU HAVE. TO WEBSITE OR pAND YOU CAN'T. SO THE THE SITES WE HAVE BEFORE IS AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME BY THE RIGHT PEOPLE THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO TO A BRICKS AND MORTAR IT MEANS WE DID SOCCER TOURNAMENTS. WE DID YOU KNOW FOOTBALL GAMES WE DID WHAT A YOU KNOW. OF FESTIVALS THE VIETNAMESE YOU KNOW FAST BALLS SO ARE CBO'S ARE GOING TO AS AND THEY CAN FILL IT OUT YOU CAN BRING A CELL ON WHEELS TO FILL THESE THINGS OUT TO HELP THAT. SO NO ABSOLUTELY NOT EVEN THE MEDIA BUT EVEN THE CBO'S ARE IN TERMS OF THAT SORT OF SECOND LEG OF DOING EVENTS AND TELL HOLES AND GOING. WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE IT'S ABOUT BRING IT TO WHERE THEY ARE WHETHER THAT'S IN A HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITY IN A COMMUNITY CENTER WE'RE GOING TO THE THIS WONDERFUL EVENT AND SOUNDS LIKE WHERE PEOPLE GOING TO BE? AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE GO OUT AND MASS AND ARE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE TO RESPOND SO ABSOLUTELY SAID IN A BOOTH OR PAY FOR BOOKS AND ALL OF THAT IS PART OF IT OKAY. THE IN PERSON WE'DLOVE TO HEAR AN INTO MY DISTRICT THERE'S FESTIVALS ALL OVER THE PLACE OF WHAT I SEE A BIG FERRIS WHEELS LIKE. JUST SEVERAL TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE SHOWING UP I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH THAT THIS. IS ESPECIALLY THE LATINO PART OF MY DISTRICT WHICH IS HUGE AND OPEN A LOT OF WAYS AND SO THAT'S BEEN ONE OF MY MAIN. PROBLEMS THAT WE BECOME SO STATIC AND WHAT WE DO THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING OUT OF BOXES GOOD TO HEAR YEAH WE WANT TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE AND GO OVER THERE. OKAY CENTER I'M BURKE AND AND SO ON AND AND I REALIZE A SOUND LIKE A BIT OF A BROKEN RECORD BUT YOU MENTIONED THE MEDIA STRATEGY. SO CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF THE METRICS IN THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD. TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF THE MEDIA STRATEGY. THOUGH BECAUSE IT'S OUT TO BID RIGHT NOW I'D RATHER NOT COMMENT ON THAT -- BUT I THINK I'M NOT A MEDIA SPECIALIST BUT I WOULD ASSUME IMPRESSIONS LOOKING AT WHERE THEY'RE PUTTING OUT THERE -- ADVERTISING AFTER USING SOCIAL MEDIA CERTAINLY HAS REALLY GREAT -- YOU KNOW MEASUREMENTS -- BUT THE MEASUREMENTS WERE USING IN TERMS OF LIKE IN PERSON -- IS MORE LIKE THE SORT OF PD I AB OF KNOWING WHERE YOU'RE GOING. SO ON MEDIA I'M GOING TO KIND OF HOLD OFF ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE MIGHT BE DOING A A MEETING HER WILL HAVE MUCH MORE -- BACKGROUND ON WHAT THE NEW TOOLS ARE IN TERMS OF MEASURING -- GET A RADIO [inaudible] PAPER. SOCIAL MEDIA SO WHEN WHEN WE DO THE R. F. P. ARE WE ASKING THE RESPONDENTS TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN WHICH IS OKAY THEIR OWN METRICS AN ORAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN THEIR OWN. WHAT WHATEVER? ANALYSES OF OF EFFICACY OR WE PROVIDING THEM WE WANT TO SEE YOU DO THE FOLLOWING HOW'S THAT WORKING. I MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RP CLOSELY WASN'T ON THAT ONE BUT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT LIKE A ELECTION WE 1100%. SO BELOW I WILL HAT JUST I JUST ASKED THAT QUESTION EVERY TIME WE COME TO THE SUBJECT IS HOW DO WE MEASURE. WHAT ARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES WHAT OUR METRICS HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WERE BEING EFFICIENT SELF SO ARMY WITH ITS WITH VOTERS WITH THE LOW PREVENTS THE VOTERS HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM FIVE TIMES RATE? BUT WE DON'T KNOW IS BECAUSE THIS HAPPENS EVERY TEN YEARS AND WE DIDN'T COLLECT THIS TYPE OF DATA IN TWENTY TEN IS. HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO TOUCH A VERY HARD TO COUNT PERSON THE HAS ALL THESE DIFFERENT VARIABLES RATE? CAPS OF THREE TIMES FIVE TIMES TEN TIMES SO THAT'S THE TYPE OF THING IS WE DON'T HAVE. DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN OR TWO THOUSAND THAT SHOWS THAT AND I'M HOPING THAT. WE'RE PUTTING THESE COLLECTIONS IN PLACE AND THAT OUR PARTNERS WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE DATA TO GIVE US SOME INDICATION. THAT YOU KNOW IF WE HIT THIS AREA SO MANY TIMES THAT MAYBE IT INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY RESPONDED AND WE'LL SEE THE RESPONSE RATE FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU BUT WITHOUT THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW. DATA FROM TEN YEARS AGO THANK YOU. THE RIVER AGUIAR-CURRY HI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APOLOGIZE THERE ATTENDED LATE -- THE THING THAT CAME TO MIND ALL OF A SUDDEN WAS THAT WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE THEIR LIVES ILLITERATE. AND THEY ARE NOT I DON'T SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO TOUCH THOSE. I LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY WORKING WITH HOUSING AUTHORITIES TRYING TO GET INFORMATION GET PEOPLE TO GO TO MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS. AND WE DIDN'T GETTING ATTENDANCE AND REALIZED MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN READ. ENGLISH OR IN THEIR OWN NATIVE LANGUAGE SO IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON AND I KNOW THAT'S A CHALLENGE BUT SO FOR SOME OF THE INFOGRAPHICS I MEAN ARE ARE THE WAYS THAT MANY OF OUR SOCIAL SERVICES REACH OUT -- AND THEN IN PERSON REMAIN ME WE TALKED ABOUT FOLKS THAT DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THAT THERE ARE PERHAPS THE READING SKILLS ARE LOW -- AND OFTEN YOU ASKED WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE THIS IN WRITING WOULD YOU LIKE SOMEBODY TO TALK WITH YOU AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW. THEY WOULD IDENTIFY SO WE'RE HOPING AGAIN TO WORK WITH OUR COMMITTEES GROUPS OR HOUSING AUTHORITIES IN THE AREAS AND SOCIAL SERVICES. AND LASTLY I'M COMMITTED TO HELP WHATEVER MY DISTRICT OFFICES COMMITTED TO HELP OUT WHICHEVER WAY WE CAN TO HELP OVERCOME SO THE BEARS ON THE LANGUAGE. AND ARE WORKING WITH YOUR TEAM SO I JUST WANT TO SAY IS THAT. I THINK WE ALL OWE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE AT THE TABLE TO HELP YOU OUT SO. I'M ALL IN APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU THERE DRAWS A GOOD TO TALK TO GET IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK -- I JUST ONE IT'S NOT AS MUCH A QUESTION AS IT IS A CONCERN -- THAT AS YOU DO THE MEDIA PLAN IN PARTICULAR -- I THINK -- IT'S SAFE TO SAY THEY'LL PROBABLY BE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SOMEWHERE. IN THAT -- OF INVESTED BY THE STATE -- AND AS WE LOOK TO LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS ESPECIALLY. REALLY OUR MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT IN THE HARD TO COUNT. OF BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YOU'RE RIGHT HOW MANY -- EVERYONE ELSE WILL NEED HOW MANY REMINDERS BUT THE HARD TO COUNT IS OUR DIFFICULTY AND LA COUNTY HAS THE LARGEST HARD TO COUNT. AND NOT TO MENTION THE HEART THAT TRANSLATES INTO THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF HARD TO COME. BUT SPECIFICALLY WITH THE MEDIA -- I JUST WANT. TO RAISE MY CONCERN THAT I'VE SEEN. IN VARIOUS VENUES AND PROGRAMS -- THAT THE MONEY GOES [inaudible] TO ONE SORT OF COMPANY OR SOMEBODY IN CHARGE OF THAT. TO DOLE IT OUT -- AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE LOSE -- THAT MONEY GOING TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT. MOST NEED IT AND IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO SENATOR UMBERG IS IF WE'RE NOT CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT FROM THEM. AND I KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH ON YOUR PLATE. THAT -- YOU WOULDN'T GET INTO THE WEEDS. OF IT ARE BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE LOSE IT AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE HAD LOTS OF PROBLEMS IS. THAT THAT REALLY THAT THE RESOURCES REALLY DON'T GET DOWN. INTO THOSE -- LOW RESOURCE OR NO RESOURCE PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES IT DOESN'T GET INTO THE ETHNIC MEDIA THEY'RE NOT THE FANCY. YOU KNOW WELL KNOWN -- MEDIA ALL OR IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEIR THEY'RE HOMEGROWN SOMETIMES SO IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU HAVE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT TO REACH OUT. TO THE COMMUNITY BASED ON THE AREA BASED ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEIR TRUSTED. THE ETHNIC MEDIA IS TRUSTED BY THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARD TO COUNT [inaudible] UNLIKE ALLEGEDLY -- NEUTRAL YOU KNOW OUTLETS MEDIA OUTLETS WHICH I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SO NEUTRAL BUT MEDIA OUT AT THE MEDIA OUTLETS ARE TRULY. TRUSTED RABIN ADVOCATES FOR THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY SO. I'M GIVING THIS LONG ABOUT WAY OF JUST URGING YOU TO EXPECT MORE. AND TO DEMAND MORE FROM HOWEVER THOSE RESOURCES -- FOR YOU KNOW FOR IT THE MEDIA HOWEVER THEY GO OUT WE'VE GOT A PUSH AND SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE. RESPONSIBLE FOR PUSHING THAT DOWN INTO THESE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN -- A CONTINUE TO BE EVEN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. APPOINTED FOR ETHNIC MEDIA -- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY KNOW. THEIR COMMUNITIES BEST NOT EVEN LOOKING AT WHAT THE US CENSUS BUREAU WILL SEND US IN TERMS OF ADS FOR LIKE FOR THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY I CAN SHOW YOU PICTURES OF WHAT THEY SENT IT WAS. DID NOT LOOK LIKE. WHAT THE YUROK TRIBE WOULD LOOK AT YOU KNOW LOOK LIKE SOUTH DAKOTA SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING HERE -- AND AND TRULY COMMITTED TO AT THE MEDIA AND IT'S EVEN MORE HELPFUL AND THAT WE WILL PUSH THAT DOWN FOR ME TO HEAR FROM YOU WHO ARE THOSE TRUSTED. BECAUSE SOMETIMES ARE SO SMALL I REMEMBER IN TWO THOUSAND I GOT ON IT TONGUE IN TALK SHOW THIS THE COMBINE A WE HAVE. YOU KNOW NINETY MINUTES ON SUNDAY EVERY THIRD SUNDAY COME TALK TO US RATE AND IT DIDN'T HAVE PROBABLY THE NIELSEN SHARE THAT EVERY ELSE WOULD HAVE. BUT WE WENT ON THERE AND WE WERE ABLE TO REACH THAT COMMUNITY IN THAT VERY MIGRATORY GET AWAY SO WE TALK ABOUT MULTI MEDIA MULTI ETHNIC AND MICROTECH AT SO I REALLY. APPRECIATE THAT AND WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. FROM ALL YOUR OFFICES BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO THOSE OUTLETS ARE -- BECAUSE HE ANY FIRM IS NOT GOING TO KNOW ALL OF THEM SO. THIRTIES WILL COMMENT. IN OUR DISTRICT -- SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY FOUR WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST -- NUMBER WITHIN A SINGLE DISTRICT OR ONE OF THE LARGE NUMBERS OF DIVERSE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER ON NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES SO IT'S REALLY. DIVERSE AND A SINGLE DISTRICT GET TO KNOW. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY. RIGHT WELL THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WE LOOK FOR TO FOLLOW UP I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GONNA STAY FOR THE HEARING AND THEN GIVE US A REFLECTION BACK FROM THEIR NECKS SET OF PANELISTS SO WE HAVE -- AS WELL SO THANKS VERY MUCH RIGHT SO IT'S WE HAVE OUR NEXT PANEL SAID THE ADVOCATE INPUT ON RE REACHING THE HARD TO COUNT WITH THE ROBUST LANGUAGE ACCESS STRATEGY WE HAVE -- JUST OF BILLY Là. DIRECTOR POLICY OF THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND SANTOSH SERENE SENTADA LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WELCOME YOU. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SO I THINK -- OKAY. THREE GOOD AFTERNOON AS CHAIRMAN PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I'M CENTER SYRIAN SANTANA AND THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR WHICH CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WE ARE COMMUNITY BASED CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO'S CHINATOWN. AND SINCE OUR INCEPTION IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE WE HAVE WORKED ON EVERY DECENNIAL CENSUS FOR THE PAST FIVE DECADES THAT WORKS INCLUDES LAWSUITS FOR THE AGAINST THE FEDERAL CENSUS BUREAU. ADVOCATING AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR INCREASED CENSUS FUNDING AND ACTUALLY DOING DIRECT OUT REACH OUR TO OUR COMMUNITY FOR CENSUS. ALL RELATED TO CENSUS HAS REMAINED CONSTANT TO HELP PRODUCE A FAIR AND ACCURATE COUNT OF OUR HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES THAT SPEAK LITTLE TO NO ENGLISH. WE CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER IMMIGRANT RIGHTS GROUPS AND CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS SUBMITTED FOUR PAGES OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON MARCH TWENTY SECONDS. TO THE CENSUS STATE LEADERSHIP ON WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD MAKE A ROBUST. MEANINGFUL AND SUBSTANTIVE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN FOR THOSE OF OUR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT COMMUNITIES THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE DRAFT DOCUMENTS THAT THE THE STATE CENSUS OFFICE PUT OUT. SO I DID PREPARE REMARKS BUT GIVEN THAT OUR STATE CENSUS DIRECTOR SHARED -- WHAT WOULD BE IN THE SECONDITERATION IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND I WOULD LIKE -- TO ADDRESS SOME OF MY QUESTIONS AND SOME COMMENTS TO THAT -- SO. I'M REALLY GLAD THAT SHE'LL BE STAYING SO SHE COULD. RESPOND SO IN THE REVISED PLAN ON THE TALKS ABOUT TRIGGERS AND SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT. WHETHER YOU HAVE NUMERICAL TRIGGERS PERCENTAGE TRIGGERS A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES THAT YOU ARE GOING TO REQUIRE IN THE STATE'S LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN. A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH IS NEVER GOING TO HIT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SMALL. IT'S NEVER GOING TO HIT THE SMALL SOUTHEAST IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN COMMUNITIES IT'S NOT GOING TO HIT. OUR PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY LANGUAGES WHICH ACTUALLY HAS NO LANGUAGE SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL CENSUS -- AND IT'S NOT GOING TO HIT THE NON WRITTEN LANGUAGES THAT ARE SPOKEN IN OUR CENTRAL VALLEY WITH OUR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. SO. THERE IT NEEDS TO BE A BIFURCATED PLAN WHICH THE PLAN ADDRESSES THE LARGER LANGUAGE ACCESS GROUPS THAT HITS THESE TRIGGERS AND THEN ANOTHER -- PLAN. TO ADDRESS THE SMALLER GROUPS. THE STATE'S LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN SHOULD AFFIRM A COMMITMENT TO THE SMALLER GROUPS AND PUT MONEY BEHIND THAT AFFIRMATION AND MORE DETAILS AROUND IT. ARE THE SECOND THING I WANTED TO TOUCH ON WAS. YOU KNOW LAST WEEK. THE SUPREME COURT TOOK UP THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION. AND BY ALL REPORTS IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITY WITH A FIVE FOUR LEANING. THE STATE'S LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN HAS TO BE NIMBLE AND FLEXIBLE. TO ADDRESS IF A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IS ON THE CENSUS BECAUSE WE AS A COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE TO BE NIMBLE AND FLEXIBLE WHAT IS THAT CONTINGENCY PLAN LOOK LIKE FROM LANGUAGE ACCESS -- THIRD. IN MANY WAYS ARE WE ARE IN A HISTORIC MOMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND ONE OF THOSE WAYS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT OUR STATE'S BORDERS. SO WE HAVE A LARGE INFLUX OF REFUGEES ARE COMING TO CALIFORNIA AND IF THEY'RE HERE APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THEY SHOULD BE COUNTED. AND THEY SHOULD BE COUNTED AND OUTREACH TO IN THEIR LANGUAGE -- AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT TO THE STATE CENSUS OFFICE WORK WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THAT HAS A NEW COMERS PROGRAM THAT HAS DATA REGARDING WHAT THOSE LANGUAGES ARE [inaudible] AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE PLAN WILL BE OUT ON THE SEVENTEENTH. SO WE COULD GIVE FURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS -- IS NEEDED IS WHILE [inaudible] ARE A THEY RECOGNIZE THAT WE THE FEEDBACK IN TEAMS WAS A TO TRANSITION FROM STANDARDS TO AN OPERATIONAL PLAN. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SEE THAT THANK YOU IN. IN THE M. MAY SEVENTEENTH AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS WHICH LANGUAGE GROUPS WILL BE TARGETED THE AMOUNT THAT WILL BE SPENT ON THAT LANGUAGE OF THOSE LANGUAGE GROUPS. AND THE RECOMMENDED AND APPROVED METHODS FOR REACHING THESE GROUPS THE PLAN SHOULD STATE WHAT QUALIFIES AS A LANGUAGE ACCESS EXPENSE AND THERE MUST BE A MECHANISM FOR PARTNERS ALL THE STATE PARTNERS TO TRACK AND REFLECT. HOW THEY ARE SPENDING THOSE DOLLARS IN EACH GROUP I THINK IT GETS TO THE ISSUE OF METRICS AND COUNTING AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S TRANSPARENCY AND -- THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO WHERE THEY NEED AND THAT THE GAPS ARE REALLY BEING FELT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND THANK YOU -- AMERICANS JOSEPH JENNA DR POLICY NOT BECAUSE IT WOULD CHIRLA THE COALITION FOR HUMANE MEGAN RICE -- WE GENERALLY WHEN I ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SENT US IN REGARDS TO LANGUAGE ACCESS RESPONSE CHIRLA IS A NONPROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION THAT WAS FOUNDED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ADVANCE SAID THE HUMAN CIVIL RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANTS JILL HAS EIGHT OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE FROM LOS ANGELES DEPARTED BILLS SUMMER GUARDINO IN SACRAMENTO AND ALSO WE HAVE A NATIONAL OFFICE. POLICY OFFICE IN WASHINGTON DC FIRST ELECTED REELECTED TAKE THAT THEY LEADERSHIP OF THE SENATE ASSEMBLY -- AND THIS COMMITTEE FOR MOVING FOR US TO RELEASE TO PLANNING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE READY FOR THE CENSUS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY A RECOGNIZING THAT THESE STEPS ARE CRITICAL GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY STEPPING BACK. AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HER TO GO COMMUNITIES TO ACTUALLY ACCOUNT LASTLY ALSO REALIZING THAT CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PRIMARY ELECTIONS ARE GOING TO BE DOING THE SAME TIME. SO MANY OTHER ANY STATIONS ARE DOING GEO TV WORK WE'LL BE DOING ALSO. GET OUT OF THE ACCOUNT AB EFFORTS SETTING THIS IS A THIS HEARING SEE A PARTICLE IMPORTANT. WE ALREADY CHIRLA ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ONE COMMUNITY IN REGARDS TO TO THE FEARS THAT THEY HAVE FIRST OUR OUR HOTLINE IS GETTING pSIGNIFICANT I QUESTIONS NOT ONLY FROM CALIFORNIA BUT IT ALSO. OTHER STATES AS RELATES TO WHAT IS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION WILL MEAN. TO THEM FURTHER MORE A FEW DAYS OTHER EFFORTS BY THE ADMINISTRATION S. RELEASED TO PUBLIC CHARGE. TRYING TO CHANGE HOW PEOPLE BECOME LEGAL RESIDENTS LEGAL PRIMARY RESIDENCE. IN ADDITION TO INCREASE INTERIOR ENFORCEMENT THAT IS INCREASING THE FEAR OF IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND REFUGEES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURE THAT I WE DO OUR PART TO THAT IN THESE LAST YEARS WOULD BE PART OF THE SENSES POLICY NETWORK. I'M A A DIVERSE COALITION OF ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE WORKING TO EDUCATE POLICYMAKERS ABOUT MAKING INVESTMENT THE WORDS THE SENSORS. UP TO THAT IN THIS YEAR WE ALSO MADE A REQUEST TO THE BUDGET I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO CBO IS A REQUIRES WAS OF NINETY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FOR DIDN'T FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED CURRENTLY. THIS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING LANGUAGE ACCESS AS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE KEY ASPECTS OF THE CENSUS IS THAT THE PLAN IN REGARDS TO LANGUAGE ACCESS. TO THAT IN. A LEASE FOR US WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HGHLIGHT THOSE THOSE LANGUAGES THAT ARE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL FOR FOR US IMMIGRANT A REPUBLICAN ESPECIALLY THE CENTER VALLEY WE SEE A NUMBER OF LOW LITERACY IMMIGRANTS WHO WHAT THEY THERE'S A STEAK MASSIVE RELATES TO WHETHER NOT THEY COME OUT AND SAY LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE AND SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A PLAN AB FOUR DOES STOP FOR DOES LANGUAGES ESPECIALLY THAT ACCOUNT -- FOR FOR FOR INCLUDING A PADDLING WHICH IS ARE NOT TRADITIONAL -- I'M IN ADDITION TO THAT. WE ATTENDED I SEE YOUR LIST OF WHAT ATTENDED THE AB COMPLETE CAM COMEDIAN WHICH THE DRAFT ON LANGUAGE ACCESS WAS RELEASED. I WOULDPROVIDE SOME SOME INPUT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE PLAN AS I GET ALLOWING MYSELF WITH -- MY COLLEAGUE SUMMONS THAT WE NEED MORE DETAILS IN REGARDS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION AND MORE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES -- WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLANS A FILL THE GAP I'M AT THE STATE BUT THAT ALSO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR EXAMPLE HOW TO ADDRESS. THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANTS AGAIN THAT SPEAK ENGLISH -- BY THEY SPEAK A DIALECT -- IN THESE CASES THE CENTRAL VALLEY. FURTHERMORE WE ALSO URGE THE STATE. I DO HAVE A PLAN THAT IS FLEXIBLE TO COVER ANY LANGUAGES ANY OTHER LANGUAGE OR DIALECT WHOSE POPULATION MIGHT BE LOWER BUT ELLIE P. MIGHT BE HIGHER AND SO THAT THAT THAT THAT GOES INTO THE SHOULD THE TRIGGER. THAT IT HAS TO BE FLEXIBE ANY AND HAS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN FOR SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE -- THAT AGAIN THAT ANY PLAN CONSIDERS NOT RE LANGUAGES INCLUDING DIALECTS AND A PM LANGUAGES -- IMMIGRANTS COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THEM WHO ARE LOW LITERACY IS THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THEM AS WELL. IN REGARDS -- TO LANGUAGE ACCESS. LASTLY WE MIGHT HAVE A PERFECT PLAN OUT BUT HE CANNOT BE IMPLEMENTED EITHER AT THE READ THE RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT ALLOCATED SO FOR US WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR STATEWIDE A REGIONAL A CBO'S TO CARRY OUT. THEIR LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION -- ACCESS PLAN WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- AC AB A CBO'S ARE COMPENSATE. WILL PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THOSE CONTRACTORS IF THEY HAVE TO MEET A SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AXIS STRESSFUL OTHERWISE I WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED. AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMITTEE -- AND AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SO I EXT. SO IT WAS SUPPOSE THAT -- CERTAINLY -- AND THEN WE ASK THEM A QUESTION IN TERMS OF OKAY WELL -- THE TRIGGERS RIGHT THERE PEOPLE DON'T SPEAK THOSE LANGUAGES THAT -- REACH THE TRIGGER AND APPRECIATE YOU SAID WELL WE SHOULD STILL FIND A WAY TO DO IT. CAN BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT YOU PROPOSE -- HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING IT WE HEARD FROM -- THE DIRECTOR THAT WILD TO MAYBE OTHER STRATEGIES AND SO FORTH BUT CAN YOU BABIES. GIVE US SOME SUGGESTIONS -- SPECIFY HOW. HOW DO WE APPROACH -- ESSENTIALLY -- THE VICE MUCH SMALLER GROUPS IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE ACCESS -- SO THEY'RE NOT THEY SAID THEY DON'T NEED TO TRIGGERED AND READ THE NUMBER OR SAID WHAT WE STILL NEED TO REACH OUT TO THEM I MEAN I THINK CONCEPTUALLY WE ALL AGREE. HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT HOW WOULD YOU PROPOSE GOING ABOUT DOING IT WHAT KIND OF THING SHOULD BE REQUIRING COUNTY USERS THE CBO'S TO BE DOING OR WHAT ARE HOW WOULD YOU THIS IT WILL? TELL US HOW TO DO IT WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM. WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH STAFF AND WE APPRECIATE THEIR TIME AND EFFORT AND I DO BELIEVE THE STATE CENSUS OUT REACH STAFF -- ARE AWARE OF THE SAME CHALLENGES AND I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU GO ABOUT IT IS ACTUALLY -- IS TO HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS -- I DON'T KNOW IF STATE CENSUS HAS BROUGHT FOLKS TOGETHER FOR THOSE KINDS OF MEETINGS AND FOR THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED. WELL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE KNOW WHO ARE THE GROUPS THAT WORK WITH THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. UP IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN WHAT THOSE LANGUAGES ARE WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO REACH THEM SOME OF A MERE HERE AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM -- WE HAVE SEE RACH HERE WHO WORKS WITH THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN COMMUNITIES AND THEY CAN SPEAK TO THOSE -- COMMUNITIES AND WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HIDDEN WE KNOW THAT THE PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY THERE ARE NO. THERE ARE NO LANGUAGE SUPPORTS SO THESE ARE KNOWN ISSUES AND KNOWN CHALLENGES AND I THINK IT REALLY ACTUALLY INVOLVES A CONVERSATION WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES ABOUT WHAT THOSE LANGUAGE ACCESS. BARRIERS ARE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAYBE IT ISN'T A TRIGGER MAYBE TO TRIGGER WITH THE BIGGER -- ELLIE P. COMMUNITIES AND MAYBE IT'S JUST. WILL COUNT EVERYBODY IN THIS POPULATION MAYBE IT'S LOOKING AT THINGS IN IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY SINCE BEEN HAVING A BIFURCATED PLAN FOR THE BIGGER LET ELLIE P. COMMUNITIES AND THEN THE MUCH SMALLER ONES. SO -- THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK ABOUT. OKAY WELL LET'S SEE. SO -- HERE BY HER TO STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WHICH IS GREAT BUT I'M NOT HEARING SPECIFIC APPROACH TO HOW ARE. AND AND I GUESS OKAY LIKE THOSE OTHER QUESTION THEN. NO CALIFORNIA VERY BIG STATE -- YOU KNOW LA COUNTY ALONE IS BIGGER THAN MOST OTHERS THAN MOST OF THE STATE AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. ALONE. YEAH RIGHT YEAH LARGER FORTY TWO OTHER STATES SO YOU WOULD TAKE LA OUT RIGHT -- SO IS THIS SOMETHING WE SAY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TAKES PLACE AT THE STATE LEVEL WHICH COURSE WE HAVE A VERY LARGE STATE OR IS THIS SOMETHING WE HAVE REGIONAL A CBO'S IS A SOMETHING WE EXPECT THE A CBO TO DO SO THAT WE GET. NOW AND EVEN SOME OF THE CEOS ARE COVERING MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND SO FORTH. SO WHAT WHAT I MEAN TERMS OF YOUR EXPECTATION ABOUT IS THIS -- IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE REACH THESE MUCH SMALLER BECAUSE WE START TALKING ABOUT PARTICULAR OR LANGUAGES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PERHAPS MAYBE IT'S THE A% CBO WHOSE FOCUSING ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT SHOULD BE DOING THIS. PURSES -- SO THE DAY. WAY YOU PROPOSED WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST. WELL WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE DRAFT LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN. THEY HAD STATEWIDE CBO'S ON THE ROOF -- RESPONSIBLE FOR SPANISH AND ENGLISH THEY HAD THE REGIONALS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SIX LANGUAGES THEY HAD COUNTIES MAKING A REASONABLE EFFORT. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME COHESIVENESS ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT. WHO WHAT ARE THE TARGETED LANGUAGES YOU HAVE THE STATE PARTNERS? HAVE THEM DETERMINE WHERE HAVE THE SENSE STATE CENSUS MY DETERMINE. ARE THE REGION'S THE BETTER ONES ARE THE COUNTIES THE BETTER ONES ARE THE STATE WIDE CBO IS YOU HAVE PARTNERS USE THEM AND AND HAVE THERE BE SOME -- COHESION. IDENTIFY THE LANGUAGES IDENTIFY THE LANGUAGE GROUPS AND AND GO FROM THERE [inaudible] YES. SUBSIDY FOR US IS BOTH FRIDAY IS MAKING SURE MILLION ALIGN MYSELF WITH MY COLLEAGUE GETTING SOME OF THE COMMENTS BUT I THINK ALSO IS VERY REGIONAL AS SERIOUS AS THE A CBL HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A GUIDE AS AS HE RELATES TO THAT. BUT MORE IMPORTANT HAVE TO HAVE SOME RESOURCES THAN IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE SOME OF THAT THAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS. I DO FOR US WE KNOW. WE KEEP THAT THERE WAS THAT A SOME. I CLEAR EXPECTATIONS RELATES TO WHAT A CBO WHO IS GOOD AT DOING HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE CANADIAN WITH A STATEWIDE PARTNERS A CIVILIZED LANGUAGE ACCESS. THAT PLAN ARE GOING TO COME. YOU KNOW COME BACK IN THE FUTURE AND THAT IS GOING TO DETERMINE A LITTLE BIT HOW TO BE CORNY BUT I DO YOU FOR US THE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF EIGHTIES. HAVE CLEAR -- GUIDANCE FROM A STATE PLAN IN RELAYED THAT TO A CBO IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO REGIONALLY BUT THAT'S HOW IS THAT GOING -- TO COMPLEMENT THIS THEY WORK SETTING THE FACT THAT THE FIRST RAP HAD A LOT OF WE HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS. IT DID NOT ALLOW US TO DO ESSENTIALLY COME A WITH A WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS. TO IN SOME ASPECTS. OKAY. SO -- SO I SEE DIRECTOR HERE I GUESS WHEN YOU REFLECT SOUNDS SOUNDS LIKE I'M HEARING A LOT OF WE NEED CLEAR DIRECTION WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT -- AT AND WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AT SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE AND THEN I GUESS. ONE HEARING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST THE DRAFT LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN WHATEVER YOU SEEN SO FAR STILL RAISE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND IT WAS LACK OF CLARITY IS TO OF THIS TO THE EXPECTATIONS ARE AND I THINK THE QUESTION WITH THE ANSWER BECOMES LIKE WHAT'S THE OUTCOME OF THE PLANT. SO THAT WAS NOT NOT LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES RIGHT SO YOU KNOW I CALM YOU KNOW WHO WHO'S GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE DOES NOT COME OKAY. BUT THE RIGHT HAVING MORE MEETING THAT PLAN WOULD HAVE ADDRESS SOME OF THE THE QUESTION BUT OKAY YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW ALSO THIS IS A GOOD CONVERSATION -- BUT ALSO GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS OF CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE WAY LA KIND IS LEADING THE WAY MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB AND I THINK THIS CONVERSATION IS TIMELY. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL MONTHS TO FIGURE THIS OUT SO I DO WHEN I PROVIDE SOME -- SOME CREDIT TODAY TO THE COMPLETE CAM COMEDIAN AND AND THE EFFORTS OF EVERYONE BUT I THINK OUR HOPE IS THAT. YOU KNOW HIS GIVEN THAT TAX THAT WE SEE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE H. SEEKING TO UNDERMINE THE SENSES AND WE HAVE TO BE AT THE STEPS AHEAD OF OF THOSE OF THOSE WHO ONE ON THEIR MIND THEY AFFECT. OKAY OKAY. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION PRE ****. PERSPECTIVES FROM COUNTIES IN COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE THIRTY A PARK MANAGER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. THE COUNTY LARGER THAN FORTY TWO STATES OKAY. MAN DEEP SAYING A SAFE DIRECTOR OF CHIKARA MOVEMENT AND JUST COAL -- WITH DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATIONS FOR ORANGE COUNTY WELCOME. WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT COUNTIES IN AC VEAS NOW YOU GET TO SPEAK FOR YOURSELVES THE WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING WHAT YOU WERE TOLD WHAT YOU EXPECTED TO DO SURE [inaudible] SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BEHANAN CHAIRMAN BERMAN TO MEMBERS OF THE SENSES SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE MANAGER. FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART TODAY'S CONVERSATION ON INSURING LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. THE COUNTY OF LA APPRECIATES THE DEDICATED SUPPORT THAT THE STATE IS DEMONSTRATED FOR LOCAL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. AS YOU RECOGNIZED REACHING OUR ENTIRE STATE WHY POPULATION ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN THIS CRITICAL CENSUS EFFORT WILL BE CHALLENGING. AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE ANY POPULATION UNCOUNTED. TODAY WE ARE HERE TO FOCUS ON THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEARLY A QUARTER OF OUR RESIDENTS. ARE CHARACTERIZED HIS LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT OUR TOP TWELVE NON ENGLISH LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN LA COUNTY AS THE STATE MENTIONED. A REPRESENT 96% OF THIS POPULATION HOWEVER THE REMAINING PROFICIENT POPULATION REPRESENTS OVER NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT SPEAK OVER A HUNDRED LANGUAGES. THE EQUIVALENT OF THE SEVENTEENTH LARGEST CITY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AFTER COMPTON. WE NEED TO ALSO SERIOUSLY EVALUATE HOW WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. AN UNDERCOUNT OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT POPULATIONS CAN POTENTIALLY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM FISCAL IMPACT ON THEIR SERVICERS. THE COUNTY ESTIMATES THAT THE FUNDING FOR FEDERAL PROGRAMS GUIDED BY DATED DERIVE FROM THE CENSUS FOR THIS 4% CAP. OF OUR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT POPULATION COULD RESULT IN AN IMPACT AND NEARLY A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION. ANNUALLY OR ONE POINT FOUR BILLION OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. MANY OF OUR COUNTY DEPARTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCE ADDRESSING LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT POPULATIONS INCLUDING THE REGISTRAR RECORDER COUNTY CLERK. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES AND OUR COUNTY HOSPITAL SUCH AS RENTALS DOING A TOOLS AND STRATEGIES THAT ARE BEING EVALUATED BY THE COUNTIES SENSES TEEMING COMPLETE COMMITTEE. COMPLETE CAL COMMITTEE INCLUDE AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IDEAS. OF UTILIZING THE REGISTRAR RECORDERS LANGUAGE TARGETING SYSTEM THAT IDENTIFIES LARGE NUMBERS OF NON ENGLISH LANGUAGE SPEAKING RESIDENTS BY VOTING PRECINCTS. A NUMBER OF THESE PRECINCTS ARE IN ARE HARD TO COUNT. AREAS AND THE REGISTRAR RECORDER IS WORKING ON FORMATTING FAIR DATA TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH HARD TO COUNT CENSUS TRACKS. SO THAT IS ONE THING WE ARE WORKING ON ANOTHER THING -- WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF WHICH WAS MENTIONED BY DE THIS AS WELL DEVELOPING LOOK MULTI LANGUAGE WEBSITES CREATING TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR MULTI LINGUAL INTERPRETERS THAT WILL VOLUNTEER AT THE CENSUS ACTION KIOSKS. AND ASSISTED COUNTY EVENTS. OPENING A PUBLIC HOTLINE. THAT UTILIZES CONTRACTED INTERPRETER SERVICES AS NEEDED TO ASSIST IN RESPONDING TO THE CENSUS ENQUIRIES. TARGET TARGETING MULTI FACETED MEDIA WHICH YOU DISCUSSED A LOT HERE -- AND THE OUTRAGE OPPORTUNITIES IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES -- AND WE ALSO WILL BE USING UTILIZING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES BY LEGAL RESOURCE UTILIZATION DATABASE. THAT CAN X. ACCESS A LIST OF CERTIFIED BILINGUAL EMPLOYEES THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT. PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES FOR COUNTY LOS ANGELES ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF COUNTY RESIDENTS IN FORTY ONE LANGUAGES TODAY. UTILIZING ALSO WIRELESS VIDEO INTERPRETING SYSTEMS LIKE THE ONE DEVELOP IT RANCHO LOS AMIGOS HOSPITAL. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS PATIENTS TO SELECT FROM FIFTY LANGUAGES AND BE ROUTED TO AN INTERPRETER WHO CAN ASSIST THEM IN THAT LANGUAGE. THE NETWORK OF HEALTH WHERE HEALTH CARE FOR INTERPRETERS REMOTELY HAS ACCESS TO LOOK UP TOOLS. AND CAN HAVE FACE TO FACE EXCHANGES TO PROVIDE KHI SERVICES. THIS TOOL HAS AGREED INCREASED PATIENT ACCESS TO INTERPRETERS BY 50%. JUST AT RANCHO LOS AMIGOS. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES WHO OPERATES RANCHO LOS AMIGOS NOW USES THE CELLPHONE NOW. TO PROVIDE MEDIA IMAGE VIDEO INTERPRETER SERVICES WHICH FURTHER INCREASES FLEXIBILITY ACCESSIBILITY IN PROVIDING LANGUAGE ACCESS SERVICE THE COUNTY IS EXPLORING WHETHER THE ACTUAL MAY BE AN OPTION. THAT CAN BE USED FOR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE CONCEPT OF THE COUNTIES EXPLORING IT'S OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE EXAMINING OPTIONS WITH DEPARTMENTS. AS AN OTHER SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. THE STATE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS RECOGNIZES LA COUNTY NEEDS SUFFICIENT TIME TO DEVELOP OF US LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN. AND WILL INVOLVE COORDINATION AND WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PHILANTHROPY AS WELL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS UNIONS MUNICIPALITIES. IS THIS THE CHAMBERS AND OTHERS. TO ALLOW THE COUNTY TO PURSUE LANGUAGE AXIS ALTERNATIVE. STATE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS HAS AGREED TO ALLOW THE COUNTY SOME ADDITIONAL TIME TO PREPARE IS LANGUAGE ACCESS STRATEGIC PLAN. ADDITIONALLY COORDINATION BETWEEN THE COUNTY IN THE STATE IN THE US CENSUS BUREAU ON THEIR LANGUAGE ACCESS APPROACH WILL BE CRUCIAL TO COMPLEMENT EFFORTS AND AVOID DUPLICATION. FLEXIBILITY AND COLLABORATION WILL BE KEY TO THIS PROCESS INCLUDING SHARING TRANSLATED MATERIALS VIDEOS AND SOCIAL MEDIA. CONTENT FLEXIBILITY IN RESPONDING TO LANGUAGE ACCESS NEEDS DURING THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP. PARTICULARLY AS REAL TIME RESPONSE REYES AND ON THE GROUND FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY AND CEOS BECOMES. AVAILABLE. AND FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THE COUNTY WORKS WITH THE STATE MEDIA CONTRACT ON ETHNIC MEDIA BUYS BASED ON TESTED MESSAGING AND OTHER ELEMENTS RELATED TO LANGUAGE ACCESS. THIS UNDERTAKING WILL ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE STATE'S ONGOING SUPPORT AND WE APPRECIATE THE NINE POINT FOUR MILLION. THAT STATE THE STATE ALLOCATED TO OUR COUNTIES LOCAL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE. BY THE RECOGNIZING THE ENHANCE STATE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO AT LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR OUR LARGE LIMITED ENGLISH POPULATION AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO ADDRESSING DIFFERENT COUNTY POPULATIONS. AS WELL AS AN EMPHASIS ON COUNTY SUPPORTING US CENSUS BUREAU'S RECRUITMENT OF A NEWMAN ENUMERATORS WE CONTINUE TO SEE. THE STATE SUPPORT FOR A REQUEST OF AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION TO HELP ENSURE A ROBUST EDUCATION IN OUR CAMPAIGN INCLUSIVE OF ALL OUR PARTNERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GREAT I'M MY NAME IS MANDY PATINKIN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TWO CAR MOVEMENT I WANT TO THANK THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE TODAY -- SINCE THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS COME UP -- THAT'S A VERY MUCH I HOPE IN OUR EXCHANGE GUY GET TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MORE ABOUT THAT -- THE JAKARTA MOVEMENT WORKS IN TWELVE COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- LARGELY THE BEEN JOB IS A COMMUNITY ALL THE WAY FROM KERN UP TO YOU -- CENTER COUNTIES. THAT WE ARE PART OF THE THE CBO'S THAT ARE SORT OF IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CBO SPECIFICALLY IN REGION SIX WHICH COVERS THE KERN -- TO FRESNO COUNTY AS WELL AS REGION FOUR WHICH COVERS MADERA UP TO SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AND THAT WERE PART OF THE GROUPS SPECIFICALLY IN SACRAMENTO THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA WHICH IS REGION ONE AND REGION THREE THE BAY AREA SO HOPEFULLY. IT ARCHING THAT CAN PROVIDE YOU SORT OF SOME INFORMATION WHAT'S HAPPENING -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- SENSE OF TWENTY TWENTY UNDOUBTEDLY WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR REASONS FAR TO HUMAN -- IF THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IS INCLUDED AND AND BY ALL MEANS THAT APPEARS TO BE THE CASE ON TOP OF LONG STANDING STRUCTURAL ISSUES WITH THE NOW ADDED -- IS ANOTHER COMPONENTS OF A RELUCTANCE THE FOR PEOPLE O EVEN WANT TO PARTICIPATE ESPECIALLY DUE TO MISTRUST OF WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST TO LOSE AND IF I COULD BE A BIT PAROCHIAL THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS EVEN THE MOST TO LOSE -- AND AND FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN TERMS OF THE SHEER SIZE -- IT HAVE TO BE PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO HOW DO WE RECTIFY THE SITUATION I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A THEME THROUGHOUT THE DAY I SORT OF HAVE THIS -- STRANGE -- SERENITY PRAYER I DO WITH THE WITH THE CENSUS WHICH IS -- YOU KNOW PLEASE GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO DO WHAT I CANNOT TEAMS FEDERALLY AND THE COURAGE TO KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO HERE IN THE STATE AND THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE -- SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE WHAT WAS THE STANDARDS THAT WAS FOR SHARED AND ADDS IT'S GOING -- DIRECTLY TO ACTUALLY BECOMING UP A PLAN -- I I DO DOES SOMETHING I JUST WANTED TO CATCH NOTICE OF WE TALKED WE SPOKE SPECIFICALLY OF AROUND -- THE ISSUE OF CANTONESE MANDARIN IN CHINESE BUT ALSO IN THAT LIST WAS FILIPINO AND TAGALOG WHICH ARE -- SORT OF THE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LANGUAGE -- THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WE HAVE TO BE WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF ETHNOGRAPHIC INCLUDING THE LINGUISTIC EXPERTISE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE REDUNDANCIES. WHERE DOES THE RUBBER HIT THE ROAD I CAN TELL YOU SPECIFICALLY -- IN THE BEEN DOUBLY SPEAKING POPULATIONS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE NOT ACCOUNTED SO SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THE LANGUAGE OF THE JOB HE HAS NEVER BEEN REPORTED SEPARATELY. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE THIRD MOST SPOKEN LANGUAGE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL THE WAY FROM KERN COUNTY UP TO CENTER COUNTY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FRESNO WHERE ITS FOURTH -- BECAUSE AMONG COMMUNITY AND SACRAMENTO BECAUSE OUR LARGE CHINESE SPEAKING POPULATIONS. UP A JOB HE HAS NEVER BEEN REPORTED. AND THAT AND THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SO EVEN WHEN WE'RE DOING THE TOP TWELVE LANGUAGE -- AGGREGATIONS EVEN DOT AND AND I APPRECIATE THE STATE -- CENSUS HAS BEEN OPEN TO THAT TO THAT DIALOGUE TO ACTUALLY GET THEM TO USE NEW NUMBERS TAX RELIEF MAKE THAT THE EVEN IN THE TOP TWELVE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THOSE LANGUAGES -- SO YOU KNOW THESE THINGS MAY MAKE A HUGE HUGE DIFFERENCE -- IN TERMS OF HOW DOES THIS INFORMATION THEN GET CYCLE AND AND TO BE HONEST -- CENTER COUNTY TOOK A LOT OF MY STEAM BECAUSE THE THE EXACT QUESTIONS HERE YOU WERE ASKING WERE VERY MUCH THE CASE. HOW DOES THAT -- INFORMATION FROM WHAT WAS THE STANDARDS SECTION FROM THE PLAN HOW HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY FILTER I CAN GIVE YOU SOME FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF WHAT OF THE PRESENT CONVERSATIONS OF A CBO SOME THE CBO'S. BUT WE DO HAVE A CONVERT QUESTION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AS A SENATOR LATER THAT ALSO BROUGHT UP SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE STATE MEDIA CONTRACT WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC RELATIONS. THE R. F. P. DOES NOT HAVE AT LEAST IN THE LANGUAGE WHEN IT WAS INITIALLY PUBLISHED IN NOT HAVE ENFORCEMENT MAC MECHANISMS IN TERMS OF THAT IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED MECHANISMS. WELLBUT THE STANDARDS DID. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S BEING BRIDGE ESPECIALLY AS WE HAVE SOME YOU KNOW AS AS THIS INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE -- IS IS BEING FILTERED AND AND THE PRIMARY CONTRACTORS IT TO BE -- AWARDED SO THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT -- MUCH SO IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING WE'RE FIGURE OUT OUR CAPACITIES THE CAPACITY IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NEW STANDARDS AND ALL OF US WANT TO HIT THESE GOALS. BUT IT'S ALSO TO FIGURE OUT -- BOTH THE CBO'S AS WELL AS YOU DON'T I MEAN TO BE FRANK. EVEN WITHIN THE JOB IS SPEAKING COMMUNITY WHICH IS LIKE THE ONE OF THE TOP TEN IN THE STATE. THE CAPACITY IS EVEN OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT AND AND ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN THIS WORLD CAN BE SOMETIMES VERY LIMITED SOMETIMES COMMUNITIES FELT FORM THEIR OWN BUBBLES. BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF HOW THEY HAVE PERCEIVED STRENGTH HOW WE GET THAT AND AND THE STAKEHOLDERS REALLY HAVE TO BE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE HAS TO DO IT IF WE DO THAT THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL. BUT THE BUT THE HOW IS GOING TO BE A HUGE QUESTION THAT THAT THAT IF WE CAN HELP SORT OUT. AT ANOTHER -- THE ISSUE I WANTED I WANTED FOR A REYES AND THEY'RE IN THE REMAINING TIME WAS -- THE THE THE RIGHT UP THE WEEK WE WILL NEED A TRACKING SYSTEM SO THE STATE HAS A TRACKING A MEASUREMENT CALLED FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING. LIVE UPDATES TO HOW WE'RE DOING IT BUT TO HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE PDI BECAUSE WE WILL NEED TO TRACK HER HOUSEHOLD SO FOR INSTANCE IF OUR GROUP IS CANVASSING THE SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOOD. YES I CAN GO TO HIGH PERCENTAGE BUT DOBBY SPEAKING NEIGHBORHOOD BUT IF BUT IF THERE'S A PRINT AMONG SPEAKING PERSON I NEED TO BE ABLE TO INDICATE THAT FOR THE NEXT GROUP TO BE ABLE TO COME AND SPEAK TO THEM PERFECTLY SO -- IF WE GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE P. I. SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE FANTASTIC BUT TO MAKE SURE IT -- KEEPS TO WHAT THE SENSES REQUIRES WHICH IS NOT NAMES AND PER HOUSEHOLD THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THAT'S WHAT.

CENTER FOR ASKED WE ALSO THAT DOCUMENTS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD SO WE WILL NEED TIME FOR BOARD TO APPROVE -- BOTH OUR AD HOC IN OUR BOARD TO APPROVE -- OKAY STRATEGIC PLAN AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US FOR OUR ELECTED BOARD TO WEIGH IN AND REALLY AND I'D. BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT STRATEGIC PLAN WOULD THAT BE THE SAME IN LA AS WELL. THE WITH THE STATE LAST MONTH THAT -- WE WERE LOOKING -- TO MAYBE DO SOMETHING MORE COMPREHENSIVE BY THE NEXT QUARTERLY REPORT ON JULY FIRST -- BECAUSE THAT WOULD GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO GO THROUGH THESE PROCESS SEES AND BAD. A LANGUAGE ACCESS HEY AND SO -- I GUESS -- DIRECTOR CRAFTING COMMON WHEN SHE DOES A REFLECTION ON DOES THAT CHANGE THE TIMELINE FOR ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT -- SO. SHE'S SHAKING HER HEAD SO I THINK THAT'S A PRELIMINARY ANSWER -- SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS PART. YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT WE NEED FIVE MILLION MORE -- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE'VE THIS IS A HISTORIC LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN THE CENSUS I MEAN WHAT I DON'T THINK THE CITY CALIFORNIA THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S EVER PUT IN -- ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HAVE WE'RE PLANNING TO BUT WE VERY BALLOT HERE HUNDRED MILLION WERE. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ANOTHER FIFTY FOUR MILLION THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. AND THEN YOU'RE COMING BACK AND SAYING I NEED FIVE MILLION MORE SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS SPEND THE FIVE MILLION MORE ON THAT. AND THEN WE WHAT WE REALLOCATED WHAT NINE MILLION TO LA COUNTY SO. I REALIZE IT'S A VERY BIG COUNTY -- BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT TAXES I THINK IS ALLOCATED ZERO NEW YORK IS ALLOCATED TO MILLION. SO I MEAN THOSE ARE BIG STATES AND I REALIZE THAT WE SINCE WE'RE COMPARING LA TO STATES SO WE'RE GIVING YOU NINE MILLION. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH -- YOU REQUESTED TWELVE MILLION LAST OKAY WHICH YOU GAVE US NINE FOUR WHICH IS CRACK SO THERE'S THE TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR GAP THERE. AND THAT CAP DID DRESS LANGUAGE ACCESS SPECIFICALLY -- IN ADDITION THOUGH THIS STATE IS ADDED SOME NEW REQUIREMENTS ONE BEING THEY'RE ASKING US TO HELP THE US CENSUS BUREAU WITH RECRUITMENT FOR ENUMERATORS WE HAD TO ASSUME THAT THAT WAS THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU'S ROLE. AND WE WERE NOT ANTICIPATING BECOMING A JOB RECRUITMENT -- EFFORT FOR THE US CENSUS BUREAU WE HAVE BEGUN LOOKING AT HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT WE HAVE PULLED TOGETHER OUR DEPARTMENTS THAT DO YOU -- SINCE SUCH AS OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES PEOPLE THAT WERE WAITING CLIENTS. AND FOLKS IN OUR COUNTY WOULD POTENTIALLY BE ENUMERATORS BUT IN ORDER TO DO -- A ROBUST EFFORT AROUND ENUMERATOR RECRUITMENT THAT WILL REQUIRE RESOURCES SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA IN. TWENTY TEN THERE WERE ELEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ENUMERATORS FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND THAT WAS IN THE YEAR WHERE THERE WAS A LOT MORE UNEMPLOYMENT. WHERE RECRUITMENT WAS A LOT EASIER -- THEN WHAT WILL FACE GOING FORWARD IN THIS EFFORT. SO THAT'S ONE BIG AREA THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOBILIZE AROUND. THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHICH IS LA COUNTY HAS. AMONGST THE LARGEST OF THE LARGEST ALSO WHO ONE OF THE LARGEST NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES LA CITY. ALONE IS THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE NATION -- LA COUNTY BEING THE LARGEST COUNTY OF NATIVE AMERICANS -- SO AGAIN -- THERE'S INTEREST FROM OUR LOS ANGELES NATIVE AMERICAN COMMISSION TO DO A REQUEST EFFORT AROUND THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. SO THESE -- SOME OF THOSE -- OTHER AREAS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT INCLUDE -- ACCESS FOR DISABILITY SO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WAS NOT ADDRESSED ORIGINALLY -- LAST YEAR AND THAT IS NOW AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS -- THAT'S BEING ASKED OF COUNTIES TO CONSIDER AND INCLUDE IT'S NOT REALLY AN OPTION IS TO BE INCLUDED -- AND THEN ALSO -- BASICALLY IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THESE EFFORTS WORKING WITH OUR KENNY WHITE CENSUS ACTION KIOSKS AND GOODWILL AMBASSADORS TO TO MOVE THIS EFFORT OUT UTILIZING WHATEVER TOOLS WHETHER IT'S UNIONS A HIGHER EDUCATION WHATEVER METHOD WE CAN USE -- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO -- SOME APPS THAT WE ARE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT WE'VE BEEN -- ASKING THE STATE TO LOOK AT NEGOTIATING A STATEWIDE PLAN AND THEN. BASICALLY -- SPREADING THAT COST TO COUNTIES ON A PRO RATED BASIS WITH LA COUNTY PICKING UP MAYBE A LARGER SHARE BECAUSE WE ARE A LARGER COUNTY THEN. MAYBE A SMALLER COUNTY WHICH SHOULD JUST GET THE APP FOR FREE. I'M SO THINGS LKE THAT HAVE ALL BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] OKAY. RIGHT YES SENATOR ASA. MY QUESTION IS. I DO THINK. FOR MONEY SHOULD GO. TO YOU BECAUSE THIS IS OUR CHANCE FOR TEN YEARS -- WE CAN COME BACK LATER AND SAY WE SHOULD OF GOOD OF OF BUT THERE IS THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES ALREADY EXIST. AS FAR AS YOU VIEW BEACH. TALKED ABOUT THAT -- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS A NUMBER OF OF WAYS MY QUESTION IS -- WHAT ABOUT THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM? AS FAR AS BEING A TRUSTED -- PARTNER -- I RAISE THAT -- SEVERAL TIMES IN DIFFERENT MEETINGS AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME. THEY ARE ALREADY IN PLACE TALK ABOUT HAVING ACCESS. TO EVERY SINGLE. WHETHER IT'S TINY COMMUNITY LARGER DOESN'T MATTER. ALL OUR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL GO TO A SCHOOL. OF IT SEEMS TO ME IS A SO HOW WOULD YOU. DO YOU THINK THAT THE DURABLE PARTNER AND HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT GETTING THE MOST. OUT OF THE THE EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FROM. TEENY WEENY KIDS TO WRITE SO LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- LAUSD HAS PREPARED A PLAN FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS AND INCLUDES ALSO ADULT EDUCATION. AND THEY'RE ALREADY -- STARTING TO USE THE LOGO FOR THIS THAT THE STATE UTILIZES ON THEIR DOCUMENTS -- AND THEY HAVE THE WE ARE. ONE PROGRAM FOR THEIR DREAMERS AND THAT'S HOW THEY'RE PUSHING OUT THE PROGRAM. THAT PLAN WAS SHARED WITH LEGO. LAKE TAHOE IS UTILIZING OPTIONS FOR THE OTHER. SEVENTY NINE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER -- SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY ARTICULATED IN THE PLAN AND ARE AVAILABLE WE ALSO SENT THE PLAN TO THE STATE SO THAT THEY ARE ALSO AWARE OF WHAT -- THE LAUSD SCHOOL DISTRICT IS PLANNING TO DO AND PUSH OUT. IF I COULD -- REPRESENT A VERY DIFFERENT CASE STUDY SO I I'M ACTUALLY ON THE SCHOOL BOARD -- ESSENTIAL UNIFIED WHICH IS IN THE CITY OF FRESNO. AND TO BE FRANK PRESENT UNIFIED WHICH IS THE FOURTH LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE. THREE TO FIVE CLOVIS UNIFIED TO MY KNOWLEDGE NONE OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY REALLY ACTIVELY ENGAGED I I ABSOLUTELY AGREE IT'S IT'S A IT'S A HUGE POTENTIAL -- POINT -- TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND THIS COULD BE -- CORRECTED IS ONLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WAS CURRENTLY SET ASIDE FOR SCHOOLS SPECIFICALLY IN THE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET. BUT THOUGHT ABOUT MAYBE A PLACE AND HOW MUCH SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE EVEN AWARE OF THOUGHTS AND HOW MANY PIECES CAN BE CUT TO MILLION INTO. AS AS UP. FOR A DIFFERENT SORT OF CONVERSATION. IN AND WE'VE INVOLVED THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY WITHIN OUR COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE AND ARE REALLY LOOKING TO THEM TO HELP GIVE US SOME OF THOSE IDEAS AND AS TO HOW BEST TO REACH OUT. TO THE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. AND YOUNG ADULTS AND THEIR FAMILIES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS -- I'D STOW SO WHAT ELEMENT NODE THAT ESTABLISHES WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. THE WE WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT CDOS AND USING CVS STORE SAID MANAGED MESSENGERS ARE LEADERS A CBO'S AND SO FORTH BUT THE CAPACITY. THAT AND THE THE NEED TO PERHAPS INVEST IN SOME CAPACITY BUILDING. BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'LL FIND OURSELVES ON APRIL FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY AND THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE WELL WE'RE KIND OF BUSY DOING A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT ASIDE FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WHICH WOULD HAPPEN THE MONTH BEFORE BUT I MEAN JUST IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HOW TO REBUILD THEIR CAPACITY. TO ACCOMMODATE MORE THAT CLOSELY SURE IT MEANS SPECIFICALLY DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT OF OUR ETHNIC COMMUNITIES HERE JUST IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN HISTORIES HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OF OF ENGAGEMENT SO FOR OUR EAST ASIAN COMMUNITIES ARE YOU HAVE PROBABLY THE MOST ROBUST SYSTEMS BEEN A BEEN BUILT OUT THAT TOOK A CENTURY AGO CENTER TO HAVE TO WOULD THAT BE. SPECIFICALLY FOR CHINESE KOREAN AND JAPANESE COMMUNITIES -- FOR OUR SOUTHEAST ASIAN COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY FOR AMONG COMMUNITIES IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT IMMIGRANT HISTORY IN TERMS OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE FEDERAL AGO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SIDE RESETTLING COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN THE FRESNO AND SACRAMENTO AREAS. BUT HAVING DONE SO. HELPING TO BUILD SOME OF THE DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS SO WHAT BECOMES THE CAPACITY THIS COMMITTEES DIFFERENT NOW IN TERMS OF THE CAMBODIAN POPULATION. DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME LEVELS OF SERVICE SERVICES THE YEMENIS POPULATION DOES NOT HAPPEN THE SAME SERVICE. IN THE PUNJABI SPEAKING COMMUNITY YOU HAVE ABOUT NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. WE'RE PROBABLY THE ONLY CBO THAT DOESN'T DO LIKE CULTURAL DANCING RESPOND AS OFFICIAL RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION. SO YOUR CAPACITIES TO REALLY ENGAGE ARE STILL RELATIVELY LIMITED. THE CENSUS ISN'T GOING TO BE A STAR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UP BUT IT IS SOMETHING FOR FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES SENATOR RAZA YES. SURE YES WITH. THE IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GIVING SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO. ULTIMATELY THE CONTRACT. THANK YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD POINT IS WE'RE WE'RE REACHING OUT TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LET'S SAY WE DO. EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. AND THE CAPACITY ISN'T THERE IN CERTAIN HARD TO COUNT OUR TO ACCOUNT COMMUNITIES. WHAT CAN WE THINK ABOUT DOING A YEAR BEFORE? SO. IF I CAN GIVE YOU EXAMPLE IN REGION SIX WHICH IS OUR OUR KERN COUNTY TO TO FRESNO COUNTY COMMUNITY -- COMMUNION ALSO GIVEN EXAMPLE IN OUR REGION. FOR IT REGION SIXTY AWARD WAS GIVEN TO THE ZERO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HEALTH A FUND WHICH IS PART OF THIS YEAR HEALTH FOUNDATION NUMBER OF OTHERS ARE PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS. WHAT I CAN SAY IS AT LEAST IN THAT AREA BECAUSE THEY FIND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GROUPS THEY THEY HAVE? PROBABLY A SENSE BETTER THAN MOST OF WHAT ARE THE CAPACITY OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GROUPS ON THE GROUND. I CAN SAY THEY'RE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT IN A IN ALL LAKE MEANS I I BELIEVE THEY ARE AND AND TO BE HONEST EVEN ON THE STATE -- SIDE -- THEY HAVE A VERY POWERFUL TEAM I MEAN I'VE GOT TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS SO THE GAPS ARE KNOWN TO EXIST. NOW YOU'RE THE HARDER PART OF YOUR QUESTION IS HOW DO WE FEEL THOSE OUT. I I THINK IT'S JUST CONTINUE USING LIKE TRYING TO EXTEND OUR NETWORKS LARGER CASTLE LARGER NOT MAYBE THAT LOOKS LIKE A TOWN HALL IN IN IN A SPECIFIC AREA BECAUSE HOW DO WE DO KNOW THAT THAT GAPS EXIST AND ESPECIALLY IF THE PLAN IS GOING TO CALL FOR THAT. NEW FORMULA THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US THAT ABOVE -- FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND AS THE MEAN -- THE MEDIAN POPULATION THAT THAT WOULD BE AND THERE'S THREE THOUSAND LANGUAGE SPEAKERS AT THAT SHOULD THE TRIGGER. IT YEAH I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT EQUATION BECAUSE LIMIT LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE SO -- IN FRESNO COUNTY TO GO TO GARLIC WOULD NOT BE A PROBABLY IN OUR IN OUR POOL ON THE BOTTOM OF OUR TOP SIX POSSIBLY BUT NOT BUT IT WOULD TRIGGER THAT THREE THOUSAND MEASURE -- CURRENTLY AT THE TABLE DO WE HAVE A GROUP THAT FOCUSES ON FILIPINO AMERICAN COMMUNITIES NOW WE DON'T. AND SO WE HAVE GROUPS THAT -- GENERICALLY DO SORT OF A LARGER ASIAN AMERICAN POPULATIONS -- THE A AND AND AND EVEN WITHIN YOU KNOW BECAUSE ASIAN AMERICAN IS A IS A CONSTRUCT YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S A POLITICAL STRUCK CONTRACT THAT HAS A LOT OF POWER BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES DOWN TO SERVICES PROVIDED. YOU'LL GO TO WHO YOU KNOW AND AND AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW OTHER COMMUNITIES THINGS DON'T DON'T -- MESH OUT GOING AGAINST PACIFIC WE IN FRESNO -- THE NUMBER OF OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY FROM THE STATE OF OAXACA IN IN IN MEXICO ESPECIALLY SORT OF INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES -- SO THE AREA WERE I'M SCHOOL BOARD TRUSTEE AHA HUGE NUMBER OF MYSTICAL SPEAKERS AS A POLITICAL SPEAKERS. ARE THOSE CURRENTLY WE KNOW WE HAVE A GAP WE HAD NO ONE GROUP IN MADERA THAT THAT YOU KNOW HOW SOME [inaudible] IT WORKS. WE KNOW THE GAPS EXIST THE STATE ABSOLUTELY KNOWS THE GAPS EXIST AND THEY'RE PUSHING ON US. TOO BUT BUT IN A IN A IN A POSITIVE WAY WE'RE WE'RE PUSHING CHALLENGING EACH OTHER -- BUT ARE THESE ROBUST EVEN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES HIMSELF SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES NOT [inaudible] YEAH. HEY RIGHT WELL THANK IS ALSO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE INSIGHTS THAT YOU BROUGHT. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH RIGHT. RIGHT TWELVE BRING UP THE RECTOR YOU MAYBE YOU CAN. GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS AND REFLECTIONS ON WHAT YOU HEARD FROM OUR PREVIOUS TWO PANELS APPRECIATE YOU AGAIN STAYING FOR THE FOR FOR FOR BOTH OF THEM THE AND LISTENING TO TO THAT THAT SECTION. NO ABSOLUTELY THAT WAS -- VERY HELPFUL IN TERMS OF LISTEN TO THAT I WANT TO JUST CLARIFY ONE THING WHICH IS -- IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STRATEGIC PLANS THAT ARE DUE FOR OUR COUNTIES -- BY FORGETTING TO USE THE WORD OF THE NO ONE POINT FOUR ONE POINT SIX WERE DUE IN THEIR THING AND WE'RE NOT ASKING LAW RASKIN THEM. WHERE WE ARE QUESTIONS QUESTION YOUR ASSISTANCE CENTERS BE? AND OF COURSE THEY KNOW THEIR MAP AND AND YOU CAN OVERLAY WE HAVE THEY HAVE IT ON THE HARD TO COME OUT THOSE LANGUAGES. SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THAT FURTHER PLAN -- BUT WE'D LIKE THAT FOR THE PLAN THAT DOROTHEA. REGARDED IN JULY SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO FOR MAY THIRTIETH -- AND EACH OF OUR RPM'S CAN WORK WITH THAT SO THIS RECORD BY THAT -- SECONDLY I REALLY APPRECIATE HEARING -- MIGHT REACH TEAM LEADERSHIP IS HERE AND I'M SO GLAD THEY COULD HEAR THIS FIRST HAND -- I HEAR THAT THEY WANT CLEAR DIRECTION. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT SO THAT REALLY IS UPON MY TEAM UNDERSTANDING AMONGST ALL OF OURS IN EACH RPM IS TO HAVE THE SAME UNDERSTANDING -- AND TO CLEARLY BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE -- WE ALSO HEARD FROM ADDITIONAL COUNTIES -- LAST WEEK AND WE'RE SETTING UP ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION EFFORTS TO GET THE CALLS BECAUSE HE'S ACTION LONGER DOING THOSE CALLS WILL BE ONE INCREASE THAT. NOW IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF MULTI PRONG IN LEAVING PEOPLE OUT WE ALSO AWARDED NEARLY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO HANDLE THE STATE WIDE WHICH INCLUDES ME COPE WHICH DOES THE INTO HIS LANGUAGE HIS. WHICH INCLUDES -- AJ A WHICH LOOKS AT THAT SO NOT WE'RE NOT JUST PRESSING SO HARD ON THE REGIONAL AND THE COUNTIES WERE MAKING SURE THAT WE WANT TO DO SOME OF THAT COVERAGE IN TERMS OF GAPS -- TO SENT TOSCHES COMMENTS ABOUT THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE DO HAVE THAT IN PLACE -- WOMEN AND THINK IT'S YOU'RE SAYING IT'S A BIG STATE THESE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WORKSHOPS OR IN THE COMMUNITY IS AND BEING REGIONAL ALLIES AND WE WANT TO GET THAT RESPONSE BACK BUT IT. DOES TAKE AWHILE TO GET TO ALL OF THEM -- IN TERMS OF SENATOR UMBERG'S THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW DO YOU MEASURE THIS AND HOW DO AUTUMN ACCOUNTABLE I MEAN THE ONE THING WE DO HAVE. IS THE HOLDER FUNDING AND NOBODY WANTS TO HOLD THAT BACK BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE WORK DONE SO I APPRECIATE WHAT NON DEEP SAID IN TERMS OF WE WANT TO WORK GATHER WHO WANT TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES -- AND I JUST WANNA -- THANK YOU AGAIN -- FOR THE TIME TO HEAR EVERYTHING FROM PEOPLE. OKAY THANK YOU -- IF YOU KNOW AND AND ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SIR A BURKE. WE WANT TO HELP YOU TO DO AN OUTSTANDING JOB -- I WANNA PUTTING ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON YOU I KNOW YOU'RE FEELING IT ALREADY. BUT THIS IS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM YOU'RE ALL LEADERS IN THIS ROOM. AND WE'RE ALL ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A DECENT COUNT. THANK YOU. A YES CENTER BERMAN YEAH AND AND JUST -- THAT IN A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT A JUMP IN AND OUT ALL DAY AND THAT WASN'T FOR LACK OF QUESTIONS TO ASK BUT I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES TO THE GREAT JOB OF COVERING ALL THE GROUND BUT IT DID I I THINK WAS VERY IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO GET. EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM TOGETHER FROM THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS -- BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF FEEDBACK SOME FOLKS ARE VERY HAPPY SOME FOLKS ARE VERY FRUSTRATED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE BY NO MEANS IS A BOTTLE NECK STOPPING ANY OF OUR COUNTIES -- IN THE CBO IS FROM FROM GETTING WORK DONE AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE -- YOU KNOW REALLY PROVIDING THEM WITH ALL THE THAT THE TOOLS IN A TIMELY MANNER -- AND TRYING TO MAKE THINGS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE AND AND MINIMIZE THE CONFUSION SO -- THE ONLY WAY WE DO THAT IS BY KNOWING WHEN AND WHERE THEY'RE CONFUSED AND AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES AND UNITED STATES LUCKILY WE'RE GETTING STARTED EARLY AND AND THERE IS -- YEAH TIME TO GET THAT FEEDBACK AND AND KIND OF ITERATE AS WE GO -- WHICH I THINK TODAY WAS IT WAS A BIG ROLE IN TERMS OF GETTING THAT NECESSARY FEEDBACK. THANKS. HEY NEAR THERE. SO. I DID A REGIS SAYS THAT -- I SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR STAYING FOR THE WHOLE HEARING APPRECIATE YOUR INITIAL PRESENTATION. I THINK IS A I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM YOU I THINK -- YOU HEARD THE QUESTIONS YOU'VE HEARD -- THE COMMENTS FROM THE VARIOUS PANELISTS. HOW WE HAVE ELEVEN MONTHS AND I KNOW YOU THAT AND YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE SO AND -- WE HAVE A TIME LINE WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH BUT ALSO TO BE SURE THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK IT'S CENTER ON BURKE SAID IS IS THAT -- NO ALL IN THIS TOGETHER RIGHT AND WE'D WANT TO BE SURE WE GET EVERYONE -- COUNTED -- THE MATTER. AND WE'LL GET TO DO ALL THE RIGHT A DIFFERENT THINGS SOME OF WHICH WE CAN'T CONTROL. AS A POINTED OUT YOU KNOW WE AND BUT OTHERS WE CAN AND WE'RE MAKING I THINK IN A PRESS INVESTMENT IN MAKING THE SUCCESSFUL WILL BE SURE THAT -- THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SEE THAT THE INVESTMENT PAYS OFF AS WELL SO I KNOW YOU'RE YOU AND YOUR TEAM AT THE POINT A SPEAR MAKING THAT HAPPEN AND SO HE WE AND OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE NEED TO ALSO -- SURE THAT SO I THINK -- SOME GREATER CLARITY I THINK SOUNDS LIKE IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM PEOPLE -- SOME PERHAPS MORE DIRECTION NAY PRE SHEET THAT YOU PRIDE OF THE GRASSROOTS APPROACH A PRIDE GIVING PEOPLE A LITTLE MORE BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT. WE NEED SOME MORE FOCUS BEFORE THE TO KNOW WHAT'S EXPECTED TO DO SO THEY CAN KNOW WHAT TO EXECUTE. AND I THINK THAT -- THAT'S THESE SOMETHING THAT I'M HEARING A LITTLE BIT AND SO WE LOOK -- FOR TO FURTHER UPDATES IS THIS IS MISS FORD SO THANKS VERY MUCH AND LOOK FOR TO OUR CONTINUING A CONVERSATION SO.

CALIFORNIA IS LEADING AND INVESTING IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S SENSES COMPLETE COUNT -- IS HAPPENING ESPECIALLY WITH THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN -- AND ALSO THAT CALIFORNIA IS INVESTING FUNDING AND TO HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES -- I'D LIKE TO JUST LIFT OF THE SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE ALREADY MADE TODAY ONE IS ENSURING THAT THE SECOND ITERATION. OF THE PLAN IS OPERATIONAL WITH MEASURABLE EFFECTIVE AND IMPACTFUL OUTCOMES. SECOND IS REALLY TO YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE TRULY PRIORITIZING SMALL LANGUAGE GROUPS AND NON FOR IN LANGUAGES SO ONE OF THE COMMUNITY. TIMES AND THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN COMMUNITY IS THAT YOU ME AND POPULATION. AND SACRAMENTO -- WE HAD THE HIGHEST UNION POPULATION -- OUTSIDE OF ASIA. AND YOU KNOW I JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THEM RECENTLY% ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES TO DO SENSES OUT REACH AND THEY SAY NOW. THEY CONTINUE TO JUST DO OUT REACH ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM -- AND THEN ALSO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU ME AND COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO BE INVISIBLE RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE CENSUS DATA DOESN'T REPORT. ON THEIR ON THEIR DATA SO THAT THEY REMAIN UNDER COUNTY. AND THEN THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES ON TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THEN LASTLY I ALSO WANNA JUST REEMPHASIZE THE COMMENT AROUND REALLY INCREASING CAPACITY. FOR A CBO AND ALSO THE SUMP SUBCONTRACTED CDOS TO CARRY OUT THE NEW LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN WHEN IT COMES OUT -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM -- OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND MAYBE IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT SENATOR PAN HAS BEEN SAYING TO YOU.

A PARTNERSHIP OF ASIAN LAW CAUCUS AND SAN FRANCISCO IN ADVANCING JUSTICE LA ONE OF THE STATE WIDE A C. B. S.. IT IS OUR PRIORITY THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS ACCURATELY REPRESENTS ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES. WE CAN ONLY DO THIS BY ENSURING LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR THE SMALLER LANGUAGE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HISTORICALLY UNDERCOUNTED IN LEFT OUT WHICH WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY LANGUAGE SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL. CENSUS BUREAU. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE STATE PRIORITIZING LARGE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT POPULATIONS WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO SEE MORE CONCRETE MECHANISMS. FOR ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF SMALLER ETHNIC GROUPS -- AS PRESENTED TODAY. WHICH HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY I ELLIE P. POPULATIONS WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT POPULATION SUCH AS TONGANS SAMOAN AND MARSHALLESE. NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN ALL OUR REACH **** CONSIDERATIONS AS THEY HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY AND IGNORED AND THEIR NEEDS. PERHAPS THEY WILL BE TRIGGERED BUT PERHAPS NOT BECAUSE THE VERY NATURE OF THE CENSUS IS TO DO THINGS THAT WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. THAT IS TO INSIST ON COUNTING EVERY INDIVIDUAL ESPECIALLY THOSE HARD TO COUNT AND THOSE ONLY EXPOSED THROUGH THE WORK. OF PEOPLE ON THE GROUND -- EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN THE STATE THAT FAILS TO BE COUNTED REPRESENTS HUNDREDS OF NOT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. OF LOST FUNDING AND EFFECTS REDISTRICTING AND REPRESENTATION ON A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL AND WE ALSO ADVOCATE FOR WORKING ITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN THE REGION'S THE COUNTIES IN THE CBO'S.
