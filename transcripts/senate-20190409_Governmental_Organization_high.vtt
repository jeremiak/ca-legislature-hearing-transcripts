00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.102
MORNING.

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:04.737
SO THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WAS

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:06.872
VERY DIFFICULT TO GRASP IN TERMS

A GREAT STARTING POINT BUT I

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.662

OVER THE COURSE OF TIME.

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:04.149
PUBLIC SAFETY HAS BECOME A VERY

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:05.417
RELIANT UPON THE MERCY

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.286

AND ALTHOUGH -- IT IS.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.871
BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.406
TECHNOLOGICALLY BASED SYSTEM --

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:28.740
AND CERTAINLY.

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:30.309
HAS.

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:32.211
THE POTENTIAL FOR GOING DOWN --

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:34.413
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE -- TO

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.081
UNDERSTAND WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:37.216

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:55.100
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT'S AN

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.935
IMPORTANT THING IT WOULD HELP US

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:58.537
UNDERSTAND THE LANDSCAPE THAT

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:00.272
WERE OPERATING IN AND IT JUST

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:01.573
OUR APPROACH TO NOTIFYING

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.941
EVACUATING PEOPLE.

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:06.044
MUCH MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY AND

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:07.479
MUCH MORE QUICKLY.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.614
I KNOW DURING THE COURSE OF OUR

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.114
PRELIMINARY AN ONGOING

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.517
EVALUATION OF THE RESPONSE IN

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:12.784
OUR EFFORT TO NOTIFY PEOPLE.

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.019
THE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION WE

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:15.754
HAVE AT THIS POINT IS THAT -- WE

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:19.091
SENT OUT -- OVER TWENTY NINE

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:20.025
THOUSAND ALERTS THROUGH OUR

MANY OF THEM GOING -- TO PEOPLE

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.298
WITH CELL PHONES.

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.933
UNFORTUNATELY IT LOOKS LIKE

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.634
THERE WAS A FAILURE RATE OF

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.335
ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND THAT

00:19:30.402 --> 00:19:32.571
BEGAN AROUND NINE O'CLOCK IN THE

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:33.305
MORNING.

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:35.040

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:40.846
TWELVE I WOULD HOPE THAT HAD WE

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:42.314
BEEN ARMED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.683
EARLIER IN THE DAY -- WE COULD

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.419
HAVE ADJUSTED OUR APPROACH -- TO

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:49.321
COMMUNICATING WITH HE COMMUNITY

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.790
pTHAT HOPEFULLY WOULD HAVE

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:52.958
REACHED PEOPLE I THINK THAT THIS

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.560
BILL WILL CERTAINLY GO A LONG

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:55.260
WAY TOWARDS DOING THAT.

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:57.930
ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:58.230
STREAMLINE.

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.432
THE COMMUNICATION OF CRITICAL

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:02.334

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:03.168
ARE ON THE GROUND.

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:07.005
HOW -- TO NOTIFY PEOPLE OF

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:09.007
DANGERS AND TO ALERT THEM TO THE

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:11.009
RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION I THINK

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:12.311
IS IMPORTANT.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.346

DO THAT WHICH IS WHY I'M IN

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:17.316
SUPPORT OF IT WHICH I THINK --

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.750

THIS AS A COMPLIMENT TO YOUR

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.622
THREE WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANT I

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:04.856
THINK THAT WAS FAR MORE

00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:06.525
DIFFICULT AND GETTING TRAINING

00:22:06.591 --> 00:22:08.260

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:10.295
IT DOES A LARGE CAN GET OUT

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.997
EARLIER OVER OUR NETWORKS BEFORE

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.098
THEY BURNED OUT.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.499

NETWORKS OUT LATER ON BUT I

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:22.374
THINK THERE IS IF YOU LOOK AT

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:23.842
THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT HAVE

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:25.877

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:26.912
ONE OF THE COUNTIES LAKE COUNTY

ACTUALLY WAS VERY STRATEGIC AND

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.849
INNER ALERTS UP VERY EARLY AND

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:32.851
HAD A FORMER POSITIVE IMPACT.

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:35.087

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:37.389

00:27:56.474 --> 00:27:58.476

REFERRED TO THE FIRE IS THE HAIR

BRUSH FIRE.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.142
OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE MISLEADING

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:33.578
FOR A FIRE THAT BURNED ALMOST

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:34.479
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES.

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:35.747
AND YET FOR SPANISH SPEAKING

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:37.949
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T ACTUALLY LOOK

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.651
OUT THE WINDOW AND SEE THIS

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:42.087
HORRIFIC FIRE BURNING.

BRUSH FIRE.

00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:46.224
SO WE REALIZE THAT.

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.860
WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE AND WHILE

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:49.861
THESE EFFORTS HAVE MADE

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:51.629
SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN THE RIGHT

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:53.665
DIRECTION MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE

00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.433

00:28:58.703 --> 00:29:00.071
PLANNING.

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:01.539
THE POINT WAS MADE EVIDENT

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.508
INDEED DURING A HEARING THAT THE

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:04.809
JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:10.548
WHICH EXAMINED HOW RECENT

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.951
LEGISLATION HAS INDEED IMPROVED

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:15.420
EMERGENCY ALERTS IN CALIFORNIA

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:16.754
THE AHA MOMENT THOUGH FOR THIS

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:18.556
BILL CAME WHEN WITNESSES

00:29:18.623 --> 00:29:20.725
DESCRIBE HOW FOR NON ENGLISH

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.793
SPEAKING COMMUNITIES.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.528
COUNTIES HAVING A STAFF MEMBER

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.964
PROFICIENT IN THE LANGUAGE OF A

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.532
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY IS SIMPLY

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.968
NOT ENOUGH. TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE

00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:31.302
STREAM OF COMMUNICATION WITH

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:32.170
THEM.

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:34.105
IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE COUNTY

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:36.040
HAVE COMPLEMENTARY COMPREHENSIVE

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:38.143

COMMUNITY IT'S CULTURAL

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.649
COMPETENCE SO THE QUESTION IS IF

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:46.017
PEOPLE GIVEN NOTICE.

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:47.552
WERE THEY GIVEN NOTICE SO WHAT

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:48.553
ARE THEY GIVEN NOTICE ON THERE

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.788
SOME COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:51.689
ACCESS TO CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.496
TO HOW ARE THEY LIKELY TO REACT

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.498
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY

00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:02.133
TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN

CIRCUMSTANCES SO THIS COMP A

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:13.378
CONCEPT OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE.

00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:15.146
REALLY TRANSCENDS LANGUAGE

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:17.248
BARRIERS TO ALSO APPLY TO

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:18.082

BETWEEN SCIENCE AND POLICY

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.780
THROUGH A SUITE OF SERVICES THAT

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:07.816
WE BRING TO YOU BRIEFINGS

AND WE SEE THAT THERE'S A STRONG

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:18.927
DESIRE IN FACT AN UNENDING NEED

01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:19.928
FOR SCIENTISTS TO COMMUNICATE

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:22.430
WITH WITH AUDIENCES OF ALL

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:25.467
LEVELS. TO SHOW WHO SCIENTISTS

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:27.435
ARE AND THE BRING THE VALUE OF

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:30.438
SCIENCE TO ALL OF THE PROBLEMS

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:31.940
THAT WE FACE AS A SOCIETY.

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:34.142
SO IT'S PUBLIC RESEARCH THAT WE

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:37.178
RELY ON TO SOLVE THESE COMPLEX

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:38.847
ISSUES THAT CALIFORNIA FACES

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:40.648
IT'S ALSO PUBLIC OUTREACH BY

01:23:40.715 --> 01:23:42.250
SCIENTISTS THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.219
COMPONENT TO OPENING THE DOORS

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:46.287
TO STEM CAREERS WE NEED THIS

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.256
PIPELINE OF THE SCIENCE SAVVY

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.557
STUDENTS.

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:50.291

THESE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE AS A

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:53.261
SOCIETY?

01:23:53.328 --> 01:23:55.663
AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.265
THE STUDENTS GET TO MEET

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.933
SCIENTISTS FIRST HAND AND IT'S

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.535
WHEN THEY MEET THE SCIENTISTS IN

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.904
PERSON THEY SEE THAT ANYONE CAN

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:03.772
BE A SCIENTIST.

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.173
AND THAT SCIENTISTS CAN DO

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.442
ANYTHING WHETHER AS A HIGH

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:09.077

THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE.

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.718
SO WE KNOW THAT OUR REACH TAKES

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:18.887
TIME IT'S OFTEN PRO BONO IT'S

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:20.622
OFTEN UNRECOGNIZED AND

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:22.590
UNSUPPORTED THAT'S WHY US DUMB

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:26.995
LAURIE IT IS THE TYPE OF

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.329
POSITION THAT REALLY.

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.397
ELEVATES THE ROLE OF SCIENCE AND

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:30.165
GIVES SCIENCE OF VOICE TO

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.466
INSPIRE THOSE WHO ARE COMING UP

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:32.200
AND WHO WILL BE OUR FUTURE

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:33.134
LEADERS.

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:34.636
THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:36.504

THE LEGISLATION AND I'VE GREW UP

02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:25.484
AROUND THE COW PALACE IN THE

02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:27.186
SINCE IT'S ABOUT SIX YEARS OLDER

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:30.656
THAN I AM -- AND SINCE I'M I

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:32.157
WILL BE RETIRING IN A YEAR AND A

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:33.359
HALF OR TWO YEARS FROM THE THIS

02:05:33.425 --> 02:05:35.227
IT MAY BE TIME TO RETIRE THE

02:05:35.294 --> 02:05:37.329
CALCULUS AS WELL BUT IT IN

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:40.466
SAYING THAT IT. TO ME THE

02:05:40.532 --> 02:05:42.234
ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS BEEN

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:44.036
CRAFTED IN CREATED AROUND THE

02:05:44.103 --> 02:05:46.305
CAL POLISH IS THE CHALLENGE AND

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:51.810
THAT'S HISTORICALLY -- HAS BEEN.

02:05:51.877 --> 02:05:53.412
SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT FIT INTO

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:54.179
THAT COMMUNITY WHEN IT WAS

02:05:54.246 --> 02:05:56.615
CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN FORTY

02:05:56.682 --> 02:05:58.517
ONE I'M SURE IT DID IT FIT.

02:05:58.584 --> 02:06:01.587
INTO OPEN A NEW COMMUNITY THAT

02:06:01.654 --> 02:06:03.455
WAS GROWING IN TRYING -- TO TO

02:06:03.522 --> 02:06:05.491
DEVELOP BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS

02:06:05.557 --> 02:06:07.259
THAT THE COMMUNITIES OF STRUGGLE.

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:07.826
IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE

02:06:07.893 --> 02:06:09.862
STRUGGLED AND HAD A VERY

02:06:09.929 --> 02:06:12.598
DIFFICULT TIME OF OF PROGRESSING

02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:14.133
TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN --

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:15.467
THEY CAN SUCCEED.

02:06:15.534 --> 02:06:17.403
IN THE CRIME ESPECIALLY IN THE

02:06:17.469 --> 02:06:19.071
SAN FRANCISCO SIDE IN NOW IN THE

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:21.307
DALY CITY SIDE -- HAS BEEN

02:06:21.373 --> 02:06:24.743
CHALLENGING I THINK AS THIS BILL.

02:06:24.810 --> 02:06:26.679
AND I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS.

02:06:26.745 --> 02:06:28.280
I THINK THAT WILL TAKE IT IN A

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:30.816
DIRECTION THAT -- THAT I DIDN'T

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:32.618
FOR COMFORTABLE WITH.

02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:34.353
BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS ALLOW

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:35.154
FOR THAT CONVERSATION TO MOVE

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.855
FORWARD.

02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:38.724
AS TO WHAT THE COW PALACE YOU

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:41.527
SHOULD BE TO THAT COMMUNITY WHAT

02:06:41.593 --> 02:06:42.928
IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THAT

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:44.129
COMMUNITY.

02:06:44.196 --> 02:06:45.664
AND WHAT IT COULD.

02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:48.133
WHAT WHAT IT COULD GROW INTO I

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.401
DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS TO

02:06:49.468 --> 02:06:52.738
DISCOURAGE OR ELIMINATE -- SOME

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:53.973
OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:55.174
OCCURRING AT THE AT THE COW

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.575
PALACE BUT THERE MAY BE A WAY OF

02:06:56.642 --> 02:06:57.843
DOING THAT.

02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:59.945
IN A WAY OF ALSO ALLOWING FOR

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:02.748
OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT AND

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:04.650
GROWTH WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY.

02:07:04.717 --> 02:07:06.085
IF IT'S HOUSING OR IF IT'SSOME

02:07:06.151 --> 02:07:07.586
OTHER AMENITIES THAT ARE

02:07:07.653 --> 02:07:09.321
NECESSARY FOR STRUGGLE UP FOR

02:07:09.388 --> 02:07:11.056
WHAT IS A STRUGGLING COMMUNITY

02:07:11.123 --> 02:07:12.658
INTO A THRIVING COMMUNITY.

02:07:12.725 --> 02:07:13.826
SO I I THINK THIS IS AN

02:07:13.892 --> 02:07:16.462
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE THAT

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:17.429
NEXT STEP HAVE THOSE

02:07:17.496 --> 02:07:19.798
CONVERSATIONS AND PERHAPS I MEAN

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:20.699
THE ONE THING ABOUT THE CAL

02:07:20.766 --> 02:07:22.101
POLICIES IS NOT THE MOST

02:07:22.167 --> 02:07:23.469
ATTRACTIVE BUILDING.

02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:25.204
AT EIGHT ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN I

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:26.739
MEAN IT IS IT IS AN EYESORE IN

02:07:26.805 --> 02:07:28.741
THE COMMUNITY -- AND PERHAPS

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:31.777
THAT CAN BE RE DONE IN A WAY --

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:33.645
THAT COULD DEVELOP THE COMMUNITY

02:07:33.712 --> 02:07:35.080
AND STRENGTH IN THAT COMMUNITY

02:07:35.147 --> 02:07:36.582

FORWARD AND HAVING THOSE

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:40.619
CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK A

02:07:40.686 --> 02:07:43.489
CRUCIAL. TO THE FUTURE OF DALY

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:45.024
CITY AND IN THE FUTURE OF THAT

02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:48.827
SOUTHERN AREA OF SAN FRANCISCO.

GO AHEAD PROCEED.

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:06.445
YES GENERALLY YOU KNOW THIS IS A

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:07.546
REALLY TOUGH ISSUE FOR ME

02:08:07.613 --> 02:08:09.148
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:12.317
LOCAL ELECTED SINNERS STRUGGLES

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:14.653
WITH THE COMMUNITY AND AND THERE

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:16.088
ARE SO THERE SEEM TO BE

02:08:16.155 --> 02:08:18.323
UNFORTUNATELY SOME CONFLICTS

02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:19.958
BETWEEN THE OF THE COMMUNITY

02:08:20.025 --> 02:08:22.261
STATE FAIR AND DOES DOES I THINK

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:23.996
NEED. TO BE CORRECTED DAYS THEY

02:08:24.063 --> 02:08:25.497
NEED TO BE ROUTED OUT.

02:08:25.564 --> 02:08:26.432
BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED THIS

02:08:26.498 --> 02:08:28.133
BILL TO DO THAT I THINK THE LAW

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:29.568
ALREADY ESTABLISHES FOR THE

02:08:29.635 --> 02:08:30.969
RELOCATION OF FAIR.

02:08:31.036 --> 02:08:33.138
POSES A HARM OR THREAT TO THE

02:08:33.205 --> 02:08:34.807
COMMUNITY AND MY HOPE.

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:36.942
IS NOT THAT WE JUST -- UNDUE

02:08:37.009 --> 02:08:39.745
AFFAIR BUT IF IF IT NEEDS TO BE

02:08:39.812 --> 02:08:41.814
RE RE LOCATED OF IT HE LOOKED

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:42.347
THE FAIR WAS OUR FIRST THE

02:08:42.414 --> 02:08:43.382
COMMUNITY.

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:45.984
DEVELOPED AROUND IF THEY DID

02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:47.653
FIND A WAY TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

02:08:47.719 --> 02:08:48.520
THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A FAILURE

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:50.122
ON ON THE LOCAL CITIES THEY THEY

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:51.857
SHOULD HAVE PLANNED A AROUND

02:08:51.924 --> 02:08:52.658
THAT.

02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:54.059
THE DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE FIRST

02:08:54.126 --> 02:08:59.264
HAVE PLANNED ACCORDING. TO A A

02:08:59.331 --> 02:09:00.032
RESOURCE THAT'S ALREADY THERE

02:09:00.099 --> 02:09:01.733
AND IF THEY DIDN'T DO THAT WELL

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.334
THAT'S SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO

02:09:02.401 --> 02:09:03.769
DEAL WITH.

02:09:03.836 --> 02:09:06.205
BUT IF THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH

02:09:06.271 --> 02:09:08.373
THAT IS -- TO TO CLOSE ON THIS

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.541
FOR I HOPE THEY IT'S READ

02:09:09.608 --> 02:09:10.843
LOCATED.

02:09:10.909 --> 02:09:11.944
AND I HOPE THERE'S A REAP A

02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:14.179
PROCESS TO RELOCATE WITHIN THAT

02:09:14.246 --> 02:09:15.447
COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:16.982
SHAME TO LOSE.

02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:18.684
ON IN A RESOURCE LIKE THIS FROM

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:20.219
MY PERSPECTIVE THE WAY I LOOK AT

02:09:20.285 --> 02:09:21.653
IT I HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.989
WITH OUR OUR STATE FOR SAN DIEGO

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:26.125
AND IMPERIAL AND IN SACRAMENTO I

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:27.659
HAVE -- SUPPORTED EVENTS IN

02:09:27.726 --> 02:09:29.561
SACRAMENTO AND I'VE GOTTEN THEM

02:09:29.628 --> 02:09:31.396
TO DO THINGS.

02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:32.831
THAT I THINK ARE JUST MARVELOUS --

02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:33.966
FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE I

02:09:34.032 --> 02:09:36.335
WOULD HATE TO DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE

02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:37.636
OF OUR STATE OF THAT RESOURCE.

02:09:37.703 --> 02:09:40.606
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAPPENS

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:41.607
AT THESE FAIRS.

02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:44.376
ESPECIALLY TO THE BACKBONE WHICH

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:45.911
ARE A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES THAT

02:09:45.978 --> 02:09:47.146
TRY FROM THERE NOT ONLY.

02:09:47.212 --> 02:09:48.947
THE TWO THEY GO TO THEIR FOR BUT

02:09:49.014 --> 02:09:50.449
THEY ALSO SERVE MY FARED SAN

02:09:50.516 --> 02:09:52.618
DIEGO AND IMPERIAL AND

02:09:52.684 --> 02:09:54.853
SACRAMENTO SO -- THIS IS REALLY

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.455
TOUGH ONE OUT ON THE LAY OFF THE

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:57.890

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:04.229
WITHIN THE GOVERNOR AND THE

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:06.899
LEGISLATURE WHO WE APPOINT THERE.

02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:08.400
ARE WE SUPPORTING THE FARES THE

02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:09.968
OTHER QUESTION I THINK WE SHOULD

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:26.451

BE USED FOR A HIGHER USE THAT

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:05.924

IT'S NOT DOING THAT ANYMORE.

02:14:35.033 --> 02:14:36.935
BUT IS INSTEAD OF TO TRY TO

02:14:37.002 --> 02:14:37.836

TO SIMPLY AUTHORIZES THE SALE.

SENATOR CAME TO MY OFFICE.

02:15:21.613 --> 02:15:23.181
I WAS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND

02:15:23.248 --> 02:15:25.417
BASICALY THE REASON WHY I WAS

02:15:25.484 --> 02:15:27.486
OPPOSED TO THE BILL WAS IT WAS A

02:15:27.552 --> 02:15:29.454
GIFT IN MY VIEW THE WAY THE BILL

ACCEPTED WILL BE ADDRESSED IN

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:44.503
PUBLIC SAFETY I THINK THAT'S

02:15:44.569 --> 02:15:46.705
APPROPRIATE.

02:15:46.771 --> 02:15:48.206
EXCUSE AT THOSE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:50.008
WAS GOING TO NEXT.

02:15:50.075 --> 02:15:52.611
IT IS REPORTED STRIPPERS FOR IT

02:15:52.677 --> 02:15:53.645
YET.

02:15:53.712 --> 02:15:56.448
SO SO AT ANY RATE -- THAT'S WHY --

02:15:56.515 --> 02:15:57.983
YOU KNOW.

02:15:58.049 --> 02:15:58.617
THAT'S WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING

02:15:58.683 --> 02:16:00.018
THE BILL TODAY.

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:01.953
SO WITH THAT CALL THE ROLL

FILE ITEM WHAT SORRY WE HAVE

02:16:05.257 --> 02:16:07.626
DOCTOR -- WANTED TO BUT WAS VERY

02:16:07.692 --> 02:16:08.927
BRIEFLY WHEN I WITH RESPECT TO

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:10.028
CENTER GLAZERS COMING WITH THE

02:16:10.095 --> 02:16:10.762
OTHER TWO AMENDMENTS I ACTUALLY

02:16:10.829 --> 02:16:11.897
DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

02:16:11.963 --> 02:16:12.697
WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS AT ALL BUT

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:13.698
IF IT WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:16:13.765 --> 02:16:14.699
PROBABLY A SIGNIFICANT SUM OF

02:16:14.766 --> 02:16:19.170
MONEY -- AND I TO ME IT IT

02:16:19.237 --> 02:16:20.272
DOESN'T MATTER FOR PREPAY.

02:16:20.338 --> 02:16:21.706
INTO THE GENERAL FUND OR STAYS

02:16:21.773 --> 02:16:23.141
WITH THE FAIRS BUT THAT'S A

02:16:23.208 --> 02:16:25.310
DECISION THAT I THINK.

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:29.915
NEEDS TO BE. FIVE FIVE MADE AND

02:16:29.981 --> 02:16:31.049
I DON'T I DON'T CARE WHICH WAY

02:16:31.116 --> 02:16:32.651
THAT THAT FALLS BUT I THINK THAT

02:16:32.717 --> 02:16:33.718
THAT DOESN'T BILLION A BIGGER

02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:34.753
ISSUE BECAUSE IT WILL BE ABLE.

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:36.087
TO TOUCH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY

02:16:36.154 --> 02:16:36.988
AND IN TERMS OF THE

02:16:37.055 --> 02:16:39.824
REIMBURSEMENT OF THE OF THESE

02:16:39.891 --> 02:16:42.260
YES FOR ANY EXPENSES -- I HAVE

02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:43.728
NO PROBLEM WITH THAT EITHER --

02:16:43.795 --> 02:16:46.264
ANY DEAL WILL INCORPORATE THAT

02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:47.666
BUT IF THAT GOES INTO THE BILL I

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:48.600
DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT

02:16:48.667 --> 02:16:50.468
BUT WE HAD DECIDED THAT WE WOULD

02:16:50.535 --> 02:16:51.903
TAKE THOSE BOTH UP AND

02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:55.574
APPROPRIATIONS INSTEAD OF HERE.

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:58.209
BUT I'M NOT OBJECTING TO EITHER --

02:16:58.276 --> 02:17:00.378
ONE AND THEN I JUST TO BE A FEW

02:17:00.445 --> 02:17:02.180
THINGS THAT WERE SAID -- TO

02:17:02.247 --> 02:17:04.249

FIRST THE DALY CITY WAS THERE.

02:17:07.519 --> 02:17:09.254
FIRST AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE

02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:10.655
THEY HAVE STRUGGLED WITH FOR A

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:12.891
LONG TIME -- THESE LOCAL ELECTED

02:17:12.958 --> 02:17:14.426
OFFICIALS AND LEADERS SUPPORT

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:16.094
THIS BILL THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:18.563

ALL THESE DECADES THEY REFUSE TO

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:34.279
GET RID OF HIS GUN SHOWS BUT

02:17:34.346 --> 02:17:35.647
EVERYONE MONEY ARE GONE -- AND

02:17:35.714 --> 02:17:36.514

LEGISLATURE AND THEY JUST

02:17:38.016 --> 02:17:39.317
