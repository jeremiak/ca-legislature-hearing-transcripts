00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:26.265

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.981
ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT I BELIEVE WE

CARRY OUT THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:46.118
VERY WELL. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:47.954
TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE STATE

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.524

THESE TOPICS. THERE ARE

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.917
CONSEQUENCES WHEN FACILITIES DO

OVERVIEW OF THIS BUT JUST AT A

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.794
VERY HIGH LEVEL JUST TO.

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:51.197
REITERATE THE KEY POINTS- STATUE

00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:53.065
REQUIRES THE SEC PERFORM THREE

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:55.634
ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE TO MAINTAIN

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:57.469
OUR THREE MAIN IT MIGHT MEAN

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:58.571
ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO THIS

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:00.206
PROGRAM WHICH ARE TO MAINTAIN.

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:01.640
THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:02.608
FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.144
OPERATION I INSPECT FACILITIES

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:06.612
ON A REGULAR BASIS RELATIVE TO

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:11.217
THOSE STANDARDS- AND REPORT ON

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:12.251
COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS. AND

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:15.454
WE NOTE THAT. THE FCC DOES NOT

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.591
HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO-

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:21.827
DIRECTLY ENFORCE THE STANDARDS.

00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:24.663
MOVING ON TO PAGE THREE WE ARE

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.365
DESCRIBED BRIEFLY THE

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:28.000
MODIFICATIONS AND THE SEC HAS

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.902
BEEN MAKING IN RESPONSE TO THE

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.338
GOVERNOR'S DIRECTIVE FROM THAT

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:35.407
EARLY TWENTY TWENTY. AND I ALSO

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.376
WON'T GO INTO MUCH DETAIL ON

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.511
THESE GIVEN THAT- MISS HOWARD

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.113
ALSO DESCRIBES SOME OF THESE

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.549
CHANGES BUT- GENERALLY WE THINK

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.184
THAT THERE ARE A STEP IN THE

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.986
RIGHT DIRECTION BUT PROBABLY

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.887
DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH. ANNA REED

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:51.056
REASONING FOR THAT- CONCLUSION

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.658
SHOULDBECOME CLEAR IN MY

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:53.859
DISCUSSION OF OUR ASSESSMENT

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:57.563
WHICH ALL RIGHT- COVER PAGE FIVE

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.031
I'M IN REALLY IT'S VERY PRETTY

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:00.933
SIMPLE ASSESSMENT AT ITS HEART

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.269
WITH ME- AND THAT IS THAT WHEN

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:05.771
WE LOOK AT ANY PROGRAM WE ASK

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:06.405
WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF THE

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:08.340
PROGRAM AND IS IT MEETING THOSE

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.708
GOALS. AND WE FOUND IN THIS CASE

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:12.444
THAT THE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:13.279
CLEAR STATUTORY MISSION OR

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:16.148
GOALS- AND THIS LEAVES

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:17.549
SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION TO THE

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:22.821
ADMINISTRATION IN DEFINING. THE

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:23.355
MISSION AND GOALS OF THE

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.490
PROGRAM. THERE IS SOME CONCERN.

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:26.625
THAT THE INFORMAL MISSION

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:28.494
CURRENTLY OF THE PROGRAM IS

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.361
ESSENTIALLY TO PROMOTE LEGAL

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:30.929
HUMANE AND SAFE CONDITIONS

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:31.730
INSIDE LOCAL DETENTION

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:33.265
FACILITIES NOTHING. WOULD

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.100
PREVENT THE ADMINISTRATION FROM

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:36.635
OPERATING UNDER DIFFERENT

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.771
INFORMAL MISSION IN THE FUTURE.

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:40.406
IN ADDITION THE LACK OF CLEARLY

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.408
DEFINED GOALS. LEAVES

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:45.244
SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION FOR SEC

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.279
TO DETERMINE HOW WHATEVER AN

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:49.581
INFORMAL MISSION IT ADOPTS IS

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:52.284
ACHIEVED SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:54.453
B. B. C. C. FOR EXAMPLE DECIDED

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.622
THAT- IT WANTED TO FOCUS ON

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:58.891
PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY AROUND

00:15:58.957 --> 00:15:59.658
CONDITIONS INSIDE DETENTION

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.593
FACILITIES. THEN ONE WOULD

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.228
EXPECT THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:05.531
TO BE FULFILLED BY- REPORTS THAT

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:06.932
ARE VERY ACCESSIBLE TO LAY

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:09.001
PERSON AUDIENCES IN CONTRAST TO

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.936
THE EXTENT THE STC CHOSE TO

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:14.239
FOCUS INSTEAD MORE NARROWLY ON-

00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:15.841
PROVIDING A SERVICE TO LOCAL

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:16.408
DETENTION FACILITY

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:19.611
ADMINISTRATORS- IT WHAT ONE

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:20.479
WOULD EXPECT THE REPORT

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.081
REASONABLY EXPECT THE REPORTS TO

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.917
CONTAIN JARGON AND- BE WRITTEN

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:27.453
FOR MORE FOR A FACILITY

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.921
ADMINISTRATOR. AUDIENCE AND THEN

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:31.090
FINALLY THAT LACK OF A CLEAR

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:33.058
MISSION AND GOALS UNDERMINES

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.059
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.761
PROGRAM. AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.097
IT'S- IT'S SIMPLY WITHOUT CLEAR

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.531
GOALS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.166
WHETHER THE PROGRAM FOR FILLS AN

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:43.402
IMPORTANT STATE FUNCTIONS THAT

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:44.403
IS CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.605
PRIORITIES- WHETHER IT'S

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:47.139
APPROPRIATELY STRUCTURED A

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:49.675
RESOURCE. AND WHETHER IT IS

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.143
OPERATING EFFECTIVELY AND

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.012
ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. WHICH

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.681
MOVING ON TO PAGE FIVE OF THE

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.549
REST OF MY COMMENTS AND HAND OUT

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:59.385
PERTAINING TO OUR

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:00.419
RECOMMENDATIONS IN LIGHT OF THIS

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:02.388
ASSESSMENT AND A HIGH LEVEL WE

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:04.590
HAVE THREE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:06.458
WHICH ARE TO ONE SIDE A CLEAR

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.160
MISSION AND GOALS IN STATUTE FOR

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:10.496
THE PROGRAM. TO ALIGN THE BOARD

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.431
MEMBERSHIP WEST THAT MISSION AND

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:15.567
GOALS AND THREE TO REQUIRE BSE

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:17.102
SEAT TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:18.837
LEGISLATURE ON HOW IT WILL ALIGN

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:21.507
THE PROGRAM WITH THE MISSION AND

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:22.307
GOALS. YOU'RE GOING INTO A

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.843
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON ON

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.345
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR FIRST

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:28.547
RECOMMENDATION AS I MENTIONED IS

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:29.415
TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR PROGRAM

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.250
MISSION AND GOALS AND OF COURSE

00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:32.518
THE LEGISLATURE COULD CHOOSE ANY

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:34.319
MISSION AND GOALS THAT IT DEEMS

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:35.788
APPROPRIATE BUT WE DO RECOMMEND

00:17:35.854 --> 00:17:39.158
SOME SPECIFIC MISSION AND GOALS-

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.826
AND ON A MISSION WE RECOMMEND IS

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.861
TO PROMOTE LEGAL HUMANE AND SAFE

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:43.862
CONDITIONS INSIDE LOCAL

00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:46.031
DETENTION FACILITIES. AND TO

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.000
FURTHER THAT MISSION WE

00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:49.902
RECOMMEND FOR SPECIFIC GOALS.

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:51.637
WHICH ARE TO ONE MAINTAIN

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:53.172
STANDARDS THAT HELP LOCAL

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.973
LEADERS DETERMINE AND MEET LEGAL

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.942
REQUIREMENTS WHICH CAN BE

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.510
COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:01.814
TRANSLATE- INTO PRACTICE TO

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.449
FACILITATE TRANSPARENCY AND

00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:05.617
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC-

00:18:05.684 --> 00:18:09.288
AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THROUGH

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:11.423
STANDARDS AND INSPECTIONS. THREE

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.825
TO PROMOTE EQUITABLE PROVISION

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:15.294
OF LEGAL HUMANIST- AND SAFE

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.365
CONDITIONS. AND FOR TO PROVIDE

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.500
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.035
STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP TO

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:25.537
FACILITATE SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:26.905
. AND AS I NOTED OUR SECOND

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:30.008
RECOMMENDATION- WHEN IT IS TO

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.844
ALIGN THE BOARD MEMBERSHIP WITH

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.045
THE MISSION WHATEVER MISSION AND

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:34.947
GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE SELECTS

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.748
AND BASED ON OUR RECOMMENDED

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:38.917
MISSION AND GOALS WE THINK THAT-

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:40.452
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO BALANCE

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.854
THE BOARD MEMBERSHIP IN ORDER TO

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.056
FACILITATE MORE OF AN OVERSIGHT

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:46.058
ROLE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.993
BOARD CURRENTLY- HAS NO MEMBERS

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.761
WITH PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE IN

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:51.230
EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF DETENTION

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:54.266
FACILITIES AS OF JANUARY TWENTY

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.567
TWENTY TWO BEFORE RECENT VACANCY

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.703
OPENED UP ON THE BOARD- SEVEN OF

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.171
THE THIRTEEN B. SEC BOARD

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:00.439
MEMBERS WERE ADMINISTRATORS OF

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.040
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:05.944
WHICH- OPERATED FACILITIES THAT.

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:07.112
WERE INSPECTED BY THE PROGRAM.

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:09.047
SO THE BOARD HAS NO SHORTAGE OF

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:11.450
IMPORTANT EXPERTISE ON OPERATION

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.085
OF LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:15.354
BUT IT LACKS EXPERTISE. ON

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.455
EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF SUCH

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:18.323
FACILITIES WHICH WE SEE AS A

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.192
DIFFERENT FORM OF EXPERTISE THAT

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:23.262
IS IMPORTANT- GIVEN THE THIS IS

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:26.131
A KEY ELEMENT OF THE BOOK AT THE

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:28.300
BOARD'S MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:31.370
AND THEN WE ALSO RECOMMEND- THAT

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:32.671
THE LEGISLATURE INCREASING

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:34.206
NUMBER MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:35.874
LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY ONLY

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:37.509
CURRENTLY TEN OUT OF THIRTEEN

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:38.410
BOARD MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED BY

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:40.913
THE GOVERNOR. WE THINK HAVING-

00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:43.081
MORE BOARD MEMBERS APPOINTED BY

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:45.384
THE LEGISLATURE COULD- ENHANCE

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.085
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE OF

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:49.087
THE BOARD OVERALL AND THE

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.589
PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR. AND

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:54.693
MOVING ON PAGE SEVEN. HERE WE

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.929
DID TELL THE- THIRD

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.730
RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:00.866
REQUIRE A PLAN TO- REQUIRED THE

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:02.401
SEC TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:03.902
LEGISLATURE ON HOW IT WOULD

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:07.172
ALIGN THE PROGRAM WITH ITS WITH

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:08.907
THE NEW MISSION AND GOALS. AND

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.409
WE THINK THAT HAVING THIS PLAN

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.044
WOULD ENABLE THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.612
DETERMINE WHETHER ANY STATUTORY

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.348
CHANGES ARE NEEDED- OR WHETHER

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:17.749
THE SEC NEEDS ANY ADDITIONAL

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:19.718
RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.253
IT WOULD ALSO FACILITATE FUTURE

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.021
EVALUATION OF PROGRAM

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:25.324
EFFECTIVENESS. AND TO GUIDE THE

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.992
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PLAN WE

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.927
RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT THE

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:31.430
PLAN DESCRIBED HOW THE SEC WOULD

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:33.899
ACHIEVE FIVE KEY OUTCOMES. WHICH

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:36.068
ARE ONE THAT THE PLAN SHOULD

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:37.369
OUTLINE HOW THE STANDARDS WILL

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.538
BE REVISED TO BE MORE SUSPICIOUS

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:40.806
SPECIFIC SUCH THAT THEY

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:42.874
EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WHAT

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:44.576
LEGAL HUMANE AND SAFE CONDITIONS

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.578
ARE. AND ENSURE THAT THE

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.113
STANDARDS ARE EQUITABLY ADDRESS

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.216
THE SPECIALIZED NEEDS OF ALL

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:53.218
INMATES AND IT CAN YOU- TO THE

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:54.152
PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE

00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:55.721
CONSIDERATION OF KEY INFORMATION

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:57.556
SUCH AS REPORTED STANDARDS

00:20:57.623 --> 00:21:00.425
VIOLATIONS. BY THIRD PARTIES

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:03.061
ESSENTIALLY- BOARD ESSENTIALLY

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:05.163
REPORTS THAT ARE NOT- JUST

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.598
DISCOVERED BY DSCC INSPECTORS

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:08.467
BUT YOU KNOW COULD BE REPORTED

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:10.135
BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- AND

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:12.404
NOT BE A CC COULD USE THIS FOR

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.873
EXAMPLE AS A WAY TO ADD MORE

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.109
STRATEGICALLY TARGET INSPECTIONS

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:19.177
- AND THEN THREE THE PLAN SHOULD

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:20.379
INDICATE HOW THE SEC WILL

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.647
DEVELOP CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:24.116
BENCHMARKS FOR INSPECTIONS- IS

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:25.817
SUCH AS- GUIDANCE. FOR

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:26.885
INTERPRETING SUBJECTIVITY IN THE

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.854
STANDARDS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.889
PROCESS TO INSURANCE SECTORS

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.492
MEET THESE BENCHMARKS. FOUR THE

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:34.960
PLAN SHOULD OUTLINE HOW THE SEC

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:36.361
WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ITS

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:38.930
REPORTING ON THE RESULTS OF

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:42.134
INSPECTIONS- AND I WOULD NOT BE

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.069
SEC HAS MADE SOME SOME CHANGES

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.270
IN THIS RESPECT WHICH HAVE BEEN

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:47.139
HELPFUL BUT I THINK WE THINK

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:49.207
THAT DATE THAT- THE FTC COULD GO

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:50.642
FURTHER SUCH AS BY. ISSUING

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:51.843
SPECIAL REPORTS TO HIGHLIGHT

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.713
CERTAIN- SEVERE CONCERNS ARE

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.715
TIME SENSITIVE ISSUES- AND

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.650
NUMBER FIVE- THE PLAN SHOULD

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:00.052
GIVE CONSIDERATION TO PROVIDING

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.586
LONGER TERM MORE COMPLEX

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:03.055
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:04.923
FACILITIES TO HELP ADDRESS- MORE

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.426
INTRACTABLE ISSUES THAT CAN TAKE

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:08.927
LONGER THAN SIX THE CURRENT

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.096
SIXTY DAY. COMPLIANCE PERIOD TO

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.432
ADDRESS AS WELL AS HOW THE FCC

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:15.133
CAN HELP- HELP HIGHLIGHT AND

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.102
PROMOTE PROMISING PRACTICES TO

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.671
FACILITATE. CONTINUOUS SYSTEMIC

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:21.273
IMPROVEMENT IN DETENTION

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:22.541
FACILITY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:24.643
STATE. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO THE

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.611

EACH US WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:55.440
OFFICE AND I WAS THE PROJECT

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:57.809

OCCURRED AT A SAN DIEGO JAILS

00:23:04.483 --> 00:23:05.383
AND WE FOCUS ON THREE MAIN

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.120
AREAS- WE FOCUSED ON THE CARE

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:10.922
THAT'S PROVIDED. THE SAFETY THAT

00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:13.725
THAT THAT THEY PERFORM AND ALSO

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:15.560
HOW THE RESPONSE TO THESE DEATHS

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:17.129
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT ISSUES

00:23:17.195 --> 00:23:19.264
ACROSS ALL OF THESE AREAS WE

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:20.365
HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:24.436
HOW. TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS-

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:25.670
ALSO TOOK A STEP. AND LOOK AT

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.439
THE STATE AS A WHOLE AND WE

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:29.007
NOTED THAT THE NUMBER OF IN

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:31.243
CUSTODY DEATHS OVER THE PAST

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:32.244
FIFTEEN YEARS HAVE BEEN

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.780
INCREASING. AND WE LOOK FOR WE

00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:36.648
LOOK AT WAYS THAT PROTECTION THE

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:38.950
STATE COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:41.686
DEATHS. AND WE LOOKED AT STATE

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:42.988
STANDARDS AND TRY TO IDENTIFY

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:45.290
SOME GAPS. AND SO WE LOOKED AT

00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:46.391
THE BORDER CITY COMMUNITY

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:49.594
CORRECTIONS THE BSE. AND WE

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:51.563
REVIEW THE REGULATIONS AND TRY

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.431
TO SEE WHAT OTHER CHANGES THAT

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:54.766
COULD THEY COULD MAKE THAT WHEN

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:56.434
THE FACTS ARE THAT WHERE MOST OF

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:57.803
THE INDIVIDUALS ARE HOUSE IN

00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:58.703
CALIFORNIA COURTS FOR YOU

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.505
BECAUSE OUR HOUSE CALIFORNIA. TO

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:01.740
MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO PREVENT

00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:03.341
THIS FROM OCCURRING AND WE FOCUS

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:07.179
ON THREE MAIN AREAS BASED ON OUR

00:24:07.245 --> 00:24:08.780
FINDINGS ON THE AUDIT. INTAKE

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.816
HOW ARE THE SCREENING-

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:11.716
INDIVIDUALS WHEN THE INTERFACE

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:13.819
SIMILARLY TO IDENTIFY MENTAL

00:24:13.885 --> 00:24:16.154
HEALTH NEEDS SO THAT THEY CAN

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:18.089
MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE CARE

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:19.291
THAT THEY NEED. THE SECOND PART

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:21.059
WOULD BE SAFETY. HOW ARE THE

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:21.993
CHECKING ON THE SAFETY OF

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.994
INDIVIDUALS NOW YOU DO THE

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:25.730
HOURLY ROUNDS THAT- DEPUTIES

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:28.033
PERFORMED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:29.668
INDIVIDUAL IS ALIVE AND WELL.

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:31.703
AND LASTLY TRAINING. ARE THE

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.738
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:35.774
THE STATE OF OUR STATE

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:36.474
CORRECTIONS OFFICERS AT LOCAL

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:37.976
DETENTION FACILITIES.

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:39.978
APPROPRIATE SO THAT THEY HAVE

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:41.379
THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. IN

00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:43.348
ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:45.650
RESPOND TO MEDICAL EMERGENCIES

00:24:45.717 --> 00:24:48.787
AND OTHER CRISES THAT EIGHT IN

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.755
THERE BY PREVENTING THESE DEATHS

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:53.725
. NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE DOT

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:56.461
BSE STANDARDS ARE MINIMUM

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:59.764
STANDARDS. AT EITHER DESIGNED SO

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:01.600
THAT ALL FACILITIES I WOULD BE

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:03.802
ABLE TO MEET THEM SO WHETHER

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:05.070
YOU'RE A LARGE FACILITY OR SMALL

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:06.371
ONE. THAT'S WHEN WE PERFORMED

00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:08.240
OUR ARTISTS AND WE LOOKED AT

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:09.274
MULTIPLE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.876
IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:12.377
WAS A MARKED A LOT OF

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:15.080
INCONSISTENCY- IN THEIR POLICIES

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:16.414
. SO WE DEVELOP SOME

00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:17.082
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE

00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:18.550
THAT STANDARDS NEED TO BE

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:19.551
ELEVATED AT LEAST FOR THE LARGER

00:25:19.618 --> 00:25:21.186
FACILITIES IN ORDERSO THAT

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:22.354
THERE'S A STANDARD OF CARE

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.990
PROVIDED. THAT THAT PROTECTS.

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:27.359
THE INSIGNIFICANT JORDY OF THE

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:27.859
INCARCERATED POPULATION

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:31.096
CALIFORNIA. SO FOR THE FIRST

00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:34.132
PART INTAKE- STATE REGULATIONS

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:35.767
DO NOT REQUIRE A MENTAL HEALTH

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:37.068
PROFESSIONAL TO SCREEN

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:39.671
INDIVIDUALS AT INTAKE. AND THUS

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:41.306
A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS MAY

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:44.609
GO UNDETECTED AND THE MAY I GET

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:45.310
THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY GET

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:47.345
INTO THE FACILITY. I'M IN SAN

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:49.447
DIEGO WE FOUND THAT HAPPENING

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:51.583
MULTIPLE TIMES WE BELIEVE. AND

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.686
WE'RE RECOMMENDING DOCKS- THE

00:25:54.753 --> 00:25:57.722
REGULATIONS BE UPDATED TO

00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:58.556
REQUIRE FOR LARGER FACILITIES.

00:25:58.623 --> 00:25:59.758
THAT A MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN

00:25:59.824 --> 00:26:02.127
EVALUATES INDIVIDUALS AT INTAKE

00:26:02.193 --> 00:26:03.428
SO THAT THEY COULD MOST

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:05.697
PROPERLY- I IDENTIFY THESE MEN

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:07.299
HEALTH NEEDS AND TO THIS DAY

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:09.834
THEY RECEIVE ON THAT CARE THAT

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:11.069
THEY NEED. THE SECOND PART

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:14.339
RELATES TO SAFETY CHECKS. NOW

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.107
AND IT DOES STATE REGULATIONS AT

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:17.676
THE TIME OF OUR AUDITS REQUIRED

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.411
THAT THE SAFETY CHECKS WHEN

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:20.345
YOU'RE PERFORMING THESE ARE THE

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:23.315
ROUNDS. ONLY ARE PERFORMED USING

00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:25.617
DIRECT VISUAL OBSERVATION BUT

00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:27.852
THEY DON'T REALLY EXPANSIONIST

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.287
RUN THE NOW. AND AS A RESULT WE

00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:31.222
SAW THE WIDE VARIATION BETWEEN

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:33.058
HOW DIFFERENT APARTMENTS ARE A

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:34.960
CHEF'S APARTMENTS ARE CHECKING

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:37.262
ON THE STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS- IN

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:38.964
SAN DIEGO IN PARTICULAR WHAT WE

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.565
FOUND IS WE LOOK AT HOURS OF

00:26:40.632 --> 00:26:42.600
VIDEO. AND WE FOUND THAT

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:44.703
OFFICERS WOULD WALK DOWN THE

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:45.403
HALL STOCKLEY TIME'S WITHOUT

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.205
BREAKING STRIDE BARELY GLANCING

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:49.274
MISSILE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.308
INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN DEAD FOR

00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:53.478
HOURS AND NO ONE. NO ONE NOTICED

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:55.213
. SO WE'RE REQUIRING THAT A

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.982
WRITTEN RECOMMENDING THAT THERE

00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:59.284
BE A CC UPDATES REGULATIONS. SO

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:01.086
THAT DAY IS SPECIFICALLY

00:27:01.152 --> 00:27:03.722
REQUIRES THAT YOU'RE CHECKING TO

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:04.956
MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:06.691
ALIVE. AND IN FACT THIS IS

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.593
ACTUALLY CONSISTENT WITH- THE

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.830
WAY C. C. R. POLICIES ON SAFETY

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:14.199
CHECKS AND THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:15.300
YOU CHECK MAKE SURE THAT

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:16.668
INDIVIDUALS LIVE. AND LASTLY

00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:19.604
TRAINING. WE LOOK AT COMPARABLE

00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:23.241
PROFESSIONS- AGAINST THAT COULD

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:24.576
LOCAL CORRECTION OFFICERS AND WE

00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:26.311
LOOKED AT PROBATION OFFICERS AND

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:27.379
YOU LOOK AT JUVENILE DETENTION

00:27:27.445 --> 00:27:29.381
OFFICERS AND WE LOOK AT THEIR

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:30.648
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND WE

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:33.251
FOUND OUT THAT THE CAR WAS FOR

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:34.619
COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND

00:27:34.686 --> 00:27:35.620
JUVENILE DETENTION OFFICERS WERE

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:39.391
HIGHER THAN THEY ARE FOR LOCAL.

00:27:39.457 --> 00:27:40.458
DETENTION OFFICERS. GIVEN THE

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:42.494
PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW IN THE

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.562
COURSE OF SAN DIEGO ON IT IN A

00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:45.730
REVIEW OF ALL THE SHARES

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.065
FACILITIES. RELATED TO HARDLY

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:48.133
MISSED RESPONDING TO MEDICAL

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:49.534
EMERGENCIES HOW ARE YOU

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.102
PERFORMING SAFETY CHECKS IT ONLY

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:54.305
MAKES SENSE. THAT THAT DESTROYED

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:55.907
ENVIRONMENTS ARE INCREASED TO

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:57.776
ALIGN WITH SIMILAR PROFESSIONS.

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.310
AND ESPECIALLY SINCE THE NUMBER

00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:01.813
OF DEATHS HAVE BEEN INCREASING

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.114
OVER TIME AT THESE FACILITIES.

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.682
AND WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT A

00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:06.651
PORTION OF THESE DESTROYING MEAN

00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:07.719
SHOULD BE RELATED TO MENTAL

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:12.323
HEALTH. AND GOING FORWARD.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.492
BECAUSE BCC'S REGULATIONS- DO

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:16.861
TOUCH ON NUMEROUS HEALTH AND

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:19.464
SAFETY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IT

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:20.765
IT ALL ENDS GIVEN THE ISSUES

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:22.734
THAT WE FOUND AT SAN DIEGO AND

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:24.436
AS PART OF OUR AUDIT IT ONLY

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:26.738
MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO ADD TO

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:28.973
THEIR BOARD A MEDICAL AND MENTAL

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.575
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHETHER

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:32.510
DEVELOPING THESE REGULATIONS THE

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:34.846
R. CORPORATION BEST PRACTICES.

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:37.282
TO ENSURE SO THAT- SO- SHIFT

00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:50.695
PARMA'S PROCESS STATE.

CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. OUR

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:27.632
ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.524
MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:56.628
VARIOUS COURT DECREES- AND- ALSO

00:29:56.694 --> 00:29:59.564
INTERNAL REGULATIONS OF THE

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:01.332
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. PART

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:03.234
OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN- TO

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:05.203
INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS IN COUNTY

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:09.607
JAILS. AND AS THE AGENDA SETS

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:13.444
FORTH- ELEVEN COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.547
SUED BY US OR OTHER FIRMS

00:30:15.613 --> 00:30:17.081
SEEKING STATEWIDE INJUNCTIVE

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.383
RELIEF IN CLASS ACTIONS IN

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:20.351
FEDERAL COURT. BECAUSE THE

00:30:20.418 --> 00:30:24.055
CONDITIONS IN THE JAILS ARE- WAY

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:29.427
BEYOND- CONSTITUTIONAL- MINIMUM

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.396
- I THINK THAT FACT ALONE IS

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:33.965
PROOF THAT THE DSCC IS NOT

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.034
EFFECTIVELY ACCOMPLISHING WHAT I

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.435
BELIEVE IT SHOULD IT'S CALL

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:40.605
SHOULD BE. WHICH IS TO PROVIDE

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:43.575
OVERSIGHT AND TO ENSURE THAT-

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:44.909
THE CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTY

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:47.312
JAILS TO MEET OUR STANDARDS SET

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:50.014
FORTH WHAT MAKES STANDARDS THAT

00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:51.482
ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:54.285
CONSTITUTION AND OTHER LAWS-

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:56.487
BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE AND

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:59.991
OTHERS EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:02.827
THAT- MOST OF THE COUNTY JAILS.

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:05.196
IN CALIFORNIA PROBABLY ARE

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.331
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ONE

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:08.066
CONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS IN AT

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:10.702
LEAST SOME RESPECTS EVERY SINGLE

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:11.903
ONE THAT WE'VE INSPECTED WE

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.939
FOUND SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND I

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:20.211
DOUBT THAT THAT'S- HEY ABNORMAL

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:29.520
SITUATION. SO- IN TERMS OF THAT

00:31:29.587 --> 00:31:32.357
WHAT THE BSE SEES ROLE IS AND

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:34.425
WHAT IT HAS DONE IN THE PAST I

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:37.996
CAN SAY- AMPLIFY WHAT- THE OTHER

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:40.365
PANELISTS HAVE HINTED AT BEFORE

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:42.967
WHICH IS THAT THE REGULATIONS

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.104
DRAFTED BY THE B. SEC- ARE NOT

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.941
VERY HELPFUL- THEY ARE. THE

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:52.944
REGULATIONS AND OFTEN REQUIRE

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:57.148
JUST A WRITTEN POLICY- THEY NEED

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:59.517
TO BE INSTEAD THEY NEED TO BE

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:00.351
VERY SPECIFIC AND SET FORTH

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:01.886
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS WHICH THEY

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:04.389
DO NOT DO FOR EXAMPLE I'LL GIVE

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:08.359
YOU TWO EXAMPLES- SECTION ONE OH

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.461
FIVE THREE REQUIRES A POLICY FOR

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:11.562
ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION WHICH

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:16.000
IS A EUPHEMISM FOR SOLITARY

00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:16.834
CONFINEMENT-THAT REGULAR.

00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:17.735
DOESN'T SPECIFY THE

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:19.537
CIRCUMSTANCES ANSWERS WHICH CAN

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.139
RESULT IN PLACE ANOTHER PERSON

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:23.141
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HOW LONG

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:26.210
HERE SHE- SHOULD BE IN THAT

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:28.746
SITUATION IT DOESN'T PROVIDE FOR

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:31.349
THE EXCLUSION- PEOPLE WITH

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:33.551
MENTAL ILLNESS FROM BEING HOUSED

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:35.320
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AS IS

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:37.522
REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION.

00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:40.425
AND DOESN'T REQUIRE- AND DOESN'T

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:44.562
REQUIRE. WRITTEN REGULATIONS

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:47.231
ABOUT HOW SOMEBODY CAN GET OUT

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:49.701
OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. ANOTHER

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:51.969
EXAMPLE IS SECTION TWELVE ELEVEN

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:53.404
WHICH MERELY STATES THAT THERE

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.939
SHALL BE WRITTEN POLICIES AND

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:56.474
PROCEDURES WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.142
DAILY SICK CALL CONDUCTED FOR

00:32:58.209 --> 00:33:01.145
ALL INMATES WERE PROVISION MADE

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:02.547
THAT ANY INMATE REQUESTING

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:04.515
MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:06.551
ATTENTION BE GIVEN SIX TENSION.

00:33:06.617 --> 00:33:09.020
HERE AGAIN THERE ARE NO DETAILS-

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:10.855
THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT WHO SHE

00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:13.458
CONDUCTS THE CALL HOUSE THE

00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:14.992
CALLS REQUEST SHOULD BE

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:16.794
PROCESSED. THERE'S NO

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.529
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CLINICIAN

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:19.897
TO SPEAK WITH THE PATIENT MUCH

00:33:19.964 --> 00:33:21.432
LESS A TIME FRAME IN WHICH A

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.134
REFERRAL SHOULD BE MADE

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.969
DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:27.238
COMPLAINT ALL OF THESE THINGS.

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:31.509
ARE REQUIRED I BELIEVE BY THE

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:33.311
CONSTITUTION. AND THE

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:34.812
REGULATIONS DON'T EVEN COME

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:38.716
CLOSE TO PROVIDING THAT KIND OF

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:42.053
LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY. SECONDLY

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.589
THE DSCC PROCESS HASN'T WORKED

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:46.991
VERY WELL BECAUSE THE JAILS NEED

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:48.593
TO HAVE ADEQUATE AND RELIABLE

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:51.963
DATA TO SHOW. AS FAR AS I KNOW

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:55.900
THERE IS NO SUCH REQUIREMENT.

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:59.170
THIRD- THE INSTRUCTIONS AS I

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:01.072
UNDERSTAND THEM I'M NEVER SEEN

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:03.207
ONE BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:06.144
LOOK AT WRITTEN POLICIES AND I

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.412
TAKE CARE OF THE EXECUTIVE

00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:09.547
DIRECTOR'S WORD FOR IT THAT

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.382
THEY- WALK AROUND THE

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.018
INSTITUTION AND- TALK TO PEOPLE

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.387
BUT I. DOUBT THAT THEY HAVE DONE

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:19.257
THAT IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL IN

00:34:19.323 --> 00:34:22.427
ORDER TO- DETERMINE ALL THE

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:24.162
ISSUES THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.531
JAIL AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:29.267
CORRECT THEM. TO DO THAT THE

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:30.535
INSPECTORS HAVE TO REVIEW LOTS

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.003
OF RECORDS INTERVIEW STAFFS

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:33.271
MAYBE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:36.574
INCARCERATED IN THE JAILS. AND

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:38.443
DETERMINE WHETHER THE POLICIES.

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:42.380
YOU ARE ACTUALLY. BEING FOLLOWED

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:45.883
AND PROVIDE DATA TO SUPPORT THAT

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:49.687
. PROBABLY OUR ONE OF THE MORE

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.923
IMPORTANT GOSH DEFICIENCIES IN

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.858
THEM THE SEC PROCESSES BEEN

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.860
ALLUDED TO BY THAT- PRIOR

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:57.528
PANELISTS AND THAT'S THE FACT

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.730
THAT THERE ARE REALLY NO DIRECT

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:01.866
CONSEQUENCES BESIDES SHOWING UP

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:04.702
AT A MEETING OF THE BOARD- FOR.

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:06.671
NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:12.243
INADEQUATE REGULATIONS- THIS IS-

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.178
WITHOUT SOME CONSEQUENCES

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:16.514
IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD THESE SHARES

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:18.483
IN THE COUNTY'S ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:35:18.549 --> 00:35:20.017
THE POOR CONDITIONS AND THAT

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.886
DOESN'T PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:23.221
THEM TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:25.389
ARE NECESSARY. WHICH I THINK HAS

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.458
RESULTED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:30.528
CONDITIONS THAT WE'VE DISCOVERED

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:31.829
ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. AND THE

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:34.165
OTHER- ISSUE ABOUT THE

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:36.634
INSPECTIONS IS AS I UNDERSTAND

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:39.971
THE INSPECTORS ARE OR- ARE NOT.

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:44.275
EXPERTS SUCH AS PHYSICIANS- WE

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.143
ROUTINELY AND IT SAID IT WOULD

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.746
BE IN MY VIEW- I'M NOT PRACTICE

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:51.749
NOT TO EMPLOY. EXPERTS IN

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.851
SUBJECT MATTER AREAS DURING THE

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.920
INSPECTIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.289
OR NOT- CERTAIN THINGS ARE

00:35:58.356 --> 00:35:59.690
ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE FOR

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:01.425
EXAMPLE AND MEDICAL CARE TO

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:03.427
VALUATE THE MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:07.131
YOU NEED TO HAVE. A PHYSICIAN.

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:09.200
FOR A NURSE AND OR A NURSE-

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:11.102
EVALUATE WHETHER THE PATIENTS

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:13.971
ARE GETTING APPROPRIATE CARE AND

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:16.607
I DON'T THINK THAT SIDE AS WELL

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.709
. FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S

00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:20.611
REALLY NOT AN EASY PROCESS TO

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.747
CHANGE THE POLICIES PROCEDURES

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:24.115
AND IN SOME CASES THE CULTURE

00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:27.451
OF- CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION IT

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:29.854
TAKES A LOT OF TIME CERTAINLY

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:32.156
SIXTY DAYS THIS. WAY IS VERY

00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:34.225
INADEQUATE OUR- OUR CONSENT

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:38.863
DECREES LAST YEAR'S- NOT DAYS OR

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.366
OUR MINDS- IT TAKES CONSTANT

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:44.769
OVERSIGHT IT TAKES TIME IT TAKES

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:47.538
DEDICATION. A DEDICATED

00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:49.173
ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS BY BOTH

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.509
THE INSPECTORS AND- THE

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:53.511
MANAGEMENT OF THE FACILITY IT

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:54.946
TAKES A WILLINGNESS TO CHANGE

00:36:55.012 --> 00:36:59.884
AND- MOST IMPORTANTLY- IT TAKES

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.752
IT USUALLY TAKES MORE FINANCIAL

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:03.988
RESOURCES AND IN EVERY CASE THAT

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:05.222
WE'VE HAD AGAINST THE COUNTY

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:08.759
JAIL THAT'S BEEN THE CASE-

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:12.897
WITHOUT. WITHOUT OUR- ADVOCACY

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:16.867
AND LITIGATION- IS THERE'S EVERY

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.502
REASON FOR THE COUNTIES NOT TO

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:21.305
PROVIDE- THE MONEY IT TAKES

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:23.975
RISKS SAY FOR EXAMPLE HEALTH

00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:25.776
CARE IN ORDER TO IN ORDER TO.

00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:28.312
NEED APPROPRIATE- CLINICAL AND

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:35.152
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS. SO I

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:36.654
BELIEVE THAT ARE ROLLED OUT OF

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:38.823
THE PRISON LAW OFFICE IN THE

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:41.592
STATE HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE- AND

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:43.794
SUMMERS IN SOME LIMITED RESPECTS

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:46.597
THE OVERSIGHT THAT THE BSE C.

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:49.100
SHOULD PROPERLY BE PERFORMING-

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.234
AND THAT SETTING APPROPRIATE

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:51.702
STANDARDS THAT ARE CONSISTENT

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.070
WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND OTHER

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:57.141
LAWS SUCH AS THE AMERICANS WITH

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:59.310
DISABILITY ACT. AND RIGOROUSLY

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:01.045
MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:04.215
STANDARDS- IT SEEMS TO ME HAT

00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:05.282
THE STATE HAS A CHOICE IT CAN

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:07.685
IMPROVE THE B. SEC REGULATORY

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:09.854
PRACTICE. AND I WOULD AGREE

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.189
THAT- THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.891
LAST YEAR ARE A GOOD FIRST STEP

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:15.693
IN THAT DIRECTION. OR I CAN

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.928
MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO- WHICH

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.530
WILL MEAN THAT MORE COUNTIES

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:22.099
WILL BE SUBJECT TO COSTLY AND

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.968
TIME CONSUMING LITIGATION IN THE

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:28.939
FUTURE SO. I VERY MUCH URGE. YOU

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:31.642
ALL TO. HE HAD SOME OF THE

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:32.276
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE MADE

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:35.179
BEFORE SPECIALLY- MAKING SURE

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:39.350
THAT THE REPRESENTATION. AND- ON

IMMERSED IN THESE ISSUES- ON THE

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.369
LOCAL JAIL SEEN FIRST HAND FOR A

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:56.072
LONG TIME. THAT SAID- I WANT TO

LINDSAY POLAND HOME BECAUSE I

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:20.530
THINK THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:22.599
PROBLEM IN AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:23.767
HERE IS THAT WE'RE STILL

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:26.236
TREATING. OF MENTAL HEALTH

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:29.105
ISSUES BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES-

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:31.641
ON A CRIMINAL PLATFORM. IN I

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.276
THINK THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:35.812
CALIFORNIA ALONE IS GUILTY OF I

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.414
THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BEEN GOING

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.215
ON SINCE ALEXANDER THE GREAT-

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:42.953
BUT- THE CALIFORNIA COULD BE THE

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:45.922
FIRST DATE. THAT MAKES THE SHIFT

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:50.627
- FROM TREATING MEDICAL ISSUES

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:51.227
TO TREATING MEDICAL ISSUES HAS

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:53.229
MEDICAL ISSUES AND CRIMINAL

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:55.398
ISSUES AS CRIMINAL ISSUES. IN

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:59.502
OUR COUNTY- HELLO IS MR

PROSPECTOR KNOWS A CAME IN AND-

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:04.407
AND I THINK ULTIMATELY DID. A

00:54:04.474 --> 00:54:06.209
GOOD THING IN TERMS OF OPENING

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:08.645
UP. THE TRANSPARENCY AROUND WHAT

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:10.914
WAS GOING ON IN THE JAILS. PART

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:14.284
WAY THROUGH PILLOWS ANALYSIS

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:16.519
WITH THE DEATH OF. A YOUNG MAN

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:21.424
NAMED MICHAEL TYREE WHO WAS IN

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:23.660
JAIL ACCORDING TO THE JUDGE WHO

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:26.062
. WHO SENT HIM THERE FOR ONE

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:27.263
REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.366
BECAUSE HE HAD A MENTAL HEALTH

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:33.269
CONDITION- IN THERE WERE NO BEDS

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:34.571
. AND SO THE JUDGE THOUGHT

00:54:34.638 --> 00:54:35.839
PUTTING HIM IN JAIL WAS OPENED

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.907
AND PUT HIM ON THE STREET ON A

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:41.945
SHORT TERM BASIS. INITIAL OPENLY

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:44.280
WASN'T EQUIPPED NUMBER ONE TO

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.549
DEAL WITH HIM. IN HIS CONDITION

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:48.318
AND NUMBER TWO. IN THAT

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:52.789
PARTICULAR CASE- THE GUARDS

00:54:52.856 --> 00:54:54.991
THEMSELVES WERE WERE SENTENCED

00:54:55.058 --> 00:54:56.226
ON THAT WAS UNPREDICTABLE

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:58.495
SENTENCED FOR MURDER IN THAT

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.864
CASE. BUT WHAT'S WHAT WAS

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.866
PREDICTABLE I THINK IS AFFECTED

00:55:02.932 --> 00:55:04.401
IN A JAIL SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:05.902
THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE

00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:07.103
BOARD WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THAT

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:12.575
WORK. 49% IN IN OUR SYSTEM. OF

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.944
49% OF THE INMATES. WITH THE

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:17.714
CURRENT CENSUS OF TWENTY FOUR

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:19.249
HUNDRED IN THE JAILS DOWN THERE

THINK TO. COMPORT WITH THE

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:32.095
CONSENT DECREE THAT WAS. SECURED

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:35.398
BY PRISON OFFICE- BUT WAS EVEN

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.701
MORE STRIKING IS. THAT AND I

00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:39.369
THINK IT WAS BROUGHT UP ON THE

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:40.437
LAST PRISONER I THINK OUR STATE

00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:43.106
SYSTEM IS STILL GEARED. TOWARD

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:44.774

FINDING. A CREAM HELLO GRANT

00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:56.286
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:58.588
GOVERNMENT SOMEONE TO BUILD

00:55:58.655 --> 00:56:01.091
ADDITIONAL JAIL SPACE- TO DEAL

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:03.293
WITH. THE CENTURY BOTH

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:07.030
POPULATIONS- CRIMINAL UNDYED

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:09.299
MOST POPULATION IN THIS

00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:11.301
POPULATION THAT. I WOULD SAY

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:12.702
FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THERE

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.671

OR TOOL DIAGNOSED WITH FROM

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.310
OTHER BUILDER HOPING HERE HEALTH

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:25.515
ISSUES. LIKE DRUG ALCOHOL- SO I

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:28.218
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YEAH I HEARD

00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:30.320
AND APPRECIATED ASSISTED

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:32.956
EVERYONE. WHO SPOKE. IN

00:56:33.022 --> 00:56:36.192
DISABILITY RIGHTS STARTED GOING

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:38.695
DOWN THIS PATH OF I THOUGHT OF.

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:41.231
YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD.

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.832
COULD PUT SOME MORE SIGNIFICANT

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:45.435
GUIDELINES IN PLACE- WHEN I LOOK

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:49.172
AT BSE SEE HERE THE REPORT SAYS

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.207
THAT IF WE INCREASED. YOU KNOW

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:54.244
JUST RECENTLY AS TWENTY TWENTY

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.645
ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. FOURTEEN

00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:57.113
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS SO THAT

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.549
INSPECTIONS COULD BE DONE AT

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:01.718
LEAST ANNUALLY. AND I DON'T KNOW

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:04.187
I GUESS ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:06.456
THAT THE CAPACITY OF BSE SEE

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.858
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE- SORT OF

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.260
JUST CHASING OUR TAILS OF WE'RE

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:13.396
GONNA SAY PSEC NEEDS TO DO MORE

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:14.497
AND THEY NEED TO HAVE MORE. MORE

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:17.033
GUIDELINES AND- IN A FEW MORE

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.669
SEATS ON THE BOARD AND- IN THEY

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:21.604
JUST THEY JUST NEED TO PAY MORE

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:22.205
ATTENTION WHEN THEY'RE DOING

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:23.373
THESE INSPECTIONS. OF THE ONLY

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:27.143
HAVE. ANOTHER PEOPLE TO DO ONE

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:30.380
INSPECTION A YEAR. WITH WIND

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:32.215
CHILL CONDITIONS ARE THIS BAD.

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:35.018
IT THEN THE MODEL ITSELF IS A

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:37.921
FAILURE IN IT AGAIN I DON'T

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:39.522
CRITICIZE I'M NOT CRITICIZING

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:41.457
PSEC IN THE LEADERSHIP THERE I'M

00:57:41.524 --> 00:57:43.193
SAYING THIS THIS MODEL WAS SET

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:44.928
UP IN A WAY OBVIOUSLY THAT

00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:47.130
DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. TO

00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:49.132
COME ANYWHERE NEAR THE OVERSIGHT

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:50.900
NEEDED FOR THE PROBLEM I THINK

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:54.404
WE'RE HEARING THAT TODAY BUT-

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:57.140
ARE WE JUST GONNA SORT OF. WAIT

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:59.042
AND SEE IF THESE FOURTEEN

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:00.143
POSITIONS TURN THE WHOLE SYSTEM

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.212
AROUND. I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:05.114
GOING TO DO IT. IN IN A CERTAIN

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:06.649
CITY DISABILITY RIGHTS YOU KNOW

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:08.218
TALKING ABOUT GUIDELINES AS A

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:10.687
WAY THE LEGISLATURE COULD COULD

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.155
GUIDE. A TRANSITION TOWARD

00:58:12.222 --> 00:58:13.890
REDUCING CAR SERRATION HOW ABOUT

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:16.526
FUNDING IN OUR GREATESTPOWER

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:19.896
IS. IS THE BUDGET HERE AND- THE

00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:21.631
END IT WOULD POSE A QUESTION I

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.266
JUST THE MONKS OR COLLEAGUES AND

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.567
YOU COULD TAKE IT AS A

00:58:24.634 --> 00:58:27.103
RHETORICAL QUESTION FOR NOW I

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.572
DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE WILL

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.007
RESPOND TO IT- I THINK. MR

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.008
LINDSAY POLAND HAS ALREADY

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:33.676
RESPONDED TO A DEFENSE BUT WHY

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:37.280
AREN'T WE HI WHY ARE WE SHIFTING

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.916
BUDGET DOLLARS IS QUICKLY AND A

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:41.951
SIGNIFICANT WE SEE AS WE CAN

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.386
THAT WOULD GO DOWNSTREAM FOR

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:45.154
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD MENTAL

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:46.656
HEALTH TREATMENT CENTERS INSTEAD

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:47.423
OF JAILS IN OUR LOCAL

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.759
COMMUNITIES- IN WHY WOULDN'T WE

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:52.195
DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY COULD

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:53.496
TO DIS INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES.

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:54.898
LIKE SANTA CLARA COUNTY WAS JUST

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.132
APPROVED ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:59.736
BED. ALL TEN MILLION DOLLAR

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:03.640
JAIL. FOR A POPULATION THAT IS

00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:05.942
ALMOST 50% MENTAL HEALTH

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:10.146
PATIENTS- IT'S AUTOMATICALLY AN

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:12.248
ADA VIOLATION I THINK TO TREAT

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:13.349
SOMEONE FOR A MENTAL HEALTH

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:16.419
CONDITION IN A JAIL HEY I JUST

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:17.921
DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND

00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:20.556
THAT. SO- ANYWAY I GUESS AS THEY

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:22.258
SAY THAT'S HOW I REALLY FEEL-

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:24.027
BUT GIVEN THAT WE'RE A BUDGET

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:26.195
COMMITTEE I DID WANT TO JUST PUT

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:27.630
THIS LARGER ISSUE OUT THERE I

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.966
THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S- THE

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:33.002
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. WHAT ARE

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:35.705
WE DOING OR WHAT ARE WE GOING TO

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:37.206
DO- TO DRAMATICALLY SHIFT

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:40.343
FUNDING TO REALLY REPRESENT- THE

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:43.446
POPULATION. OR IF YOU WORK WITH

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:46.249
THE INTAKE OF THE POPULATION THE

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.217
INTAKE OF THE GILLS NOW A

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:49.886
BLESSING I WANTED TO SAY WAS

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:53.690
RELATIVE TO. THE EXAMPLE OF MY

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:57.327
OWN HOME COUNTY. THE NUMBERS

00:59:57.393 --> 01:00:00.229

REGULATED WE TRIED TO AND

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.536
INFLUENCE THE REGULATIONS WHEN

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:06.629

KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO GET OVERLY

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.506
OVERLY GRANULAR BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:20.042

CONCERNING PEOPLE BEING WOKEN

MULTIPLE TIMES AS PART OF A

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.517
SAFETY CHECK TO DETERMINE THAT

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:30.419
PEOPLE ARE ALIVE I MEAN YOU HAVE

TO FIND A BALANCED. AND

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:34.323
REASONABLE SPOT TO LAND. PURPOSE

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.425
OF THIS FEATURE IS. THE SAFETY

THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING. WE

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:46.936

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:49.372
NOT IN DISTRESS IS NOT HAVING A

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:50.539
MEDICAL ISSUE OR ANY OTHER

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:51.874
METHOD MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:52.908
ISSUES THAT COULD NEED

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:56.746
IMMEDIATE. ATTENTION SO- I WOULD

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:59.048
SAY. FIRST COUPLE OF THOUGHTS

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:00.783
ARE WE ABSOLUTELY WORK

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:01.951
EXTENSIVELY WITH SUBJECT MATTER

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.652
EXPERTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.855
UPDATES TO OUR REGULATIONS. ONE

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:06.756
OF THE OTHER POINTS MISTER

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:08.257
SPECTER TALKED ABOUT WAS THAT

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.792
THERE SHOULD BE SUBJECT MATTER

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:10.459
EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:11.794
INSPECTIONS THEMSELVES. AND IT

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:12.995
COMES TO THE DELIVERY OF THE

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:14.964
HEALTH CARE OF THE JAILS IT I

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.465
THE COUNTY HEALTH. DEPARTMENT

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:18.067
THAT CONDUCTS AN ANNUAL

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:20.636
INSPECTION SO. SOME OF THE OF

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:21.637
THE INFORMATION HAS BEEN

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.706
PROVIDED- HERE TODAY DOESN'T

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:26.509
SQUARE. WITH ACTUAL PRACTICE.

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:28.611
THE OTHER THING- THERE THERE'S A

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:30.179
LOT MORE THAT WE SHOULD SAY BUT

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:32.014
I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR ONE OTHER

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.516
ITEM OF CONFUSION WE DID INCLUDE

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:35.885
THIS IN OUR- OUR RESPONSE LETTER

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:37.753
TO THE AUDIT. I BELIEVE THE

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.422
AUDITOR HAS A MISUNDERSTANDING

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:41.323
WHEN IT SAYS THAT THE CDC ARE

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.427
REGULATIONS. ON SAFETY CHECKS

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:46.128
REQUIRES THE PERSON DOING THE

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:48.330
INSPECTION TO DETERMINE THAT THE

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:50.599
PERSON IS ALIVE. THE SPECIFIC

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.234
CITATION THAT THEY MADE COMES

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:53.836
FROM THE CDC OUR OPERATIONS

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:56.172
MANUAL. AND THAT SECTION IS NOT

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.673
PERTAINING TO SAFETY CHECKS

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.508
INSTEAD IT'S PERTAINING TO DOING

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.911
AN ACTUAL COUNT. OF THE NUMBER

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.379
OF PEOPLE IN FACILITY AND IT'S A

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:06.182
REGULATION THAT SAYS. THAT THEY

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:08.017
ARE TO COUNT BOTH LIVING

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.985
BREATHING INDIVIDUALS AND SOME

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:11.887
OF THE STUFF IS REALLY. HARSH TO

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:13.489
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT THAT

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:14.490
MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T COUNT DEAD

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:16.392
PEOPLE IN THE POPULATION YEAH

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.260
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT IS IT

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:19.829
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH THE

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.230
SAFETY CHECK. SO OBVIOUSLY IS A

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:23.432
VERY DIFFICULT SET OF ISSUES-

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:25.234
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE SPECIFIC

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.102
ISSUES I WANTED TO MENTION A

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:29.271
THOUSAND IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND-

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:37.079
TALKING ABOUT. SOME OF THE

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.214
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON OUR

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.114

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:51.873
LEGITIMATE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO. ARE

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.276

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.766
CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT WAS

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:21.036

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:45.694
THE- TESTIMONY OF THE VARIOUS-

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.863
PANELISTS WHO WERE HERE TODAY

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:48.930
THEY CERTAINLY RAISE ALL THESE

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:51.466
ISSUES OUT OF CARE AND CONCERN

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:54.269

THE STAFF OF THE FACILITIES

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:02.010
BECAUSE NOBODY SHOULD FEEL THAT

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:05.480

AND YET. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:24.366
I THINK THIS IS A LOT STRONGER

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.768

EFFICIENCIES- SECOND THE WE

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.203
UNDERSTAND BASED ON

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:09.170
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:10.638
ADMINISTRATION THAT IT DIDN'T DO

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:13.575
A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF. THE

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:15.910
INMATE REHABILITATION AND HEALTH

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:17.312
CARE NEEDS AS IT IDENTIFIED

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.447
PROJECTS SO WHILE THERE ARE SOME

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:21.416
THERE ARE A FEW PROJECTS IN THE

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:23.485
TEN YEAR- LIST OF PROJECTS THAT

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:29.691
APPEAR THAT THAT SAY- REFLECTS

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:31.226
REFLECTIVE OF A COMPREHENSIVE

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:33.661
ANALYSIS OF PROJECTED NEED AND

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:39.234
THOSE- IN THOSE AREAS- AND THEN

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.102
WHILE THE S. R. L. DID NOT

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:43.438
DIRECTLY REQUIRE CDCR TO

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:44.439
CONSIDER THE INTERSECTION

FUTURE POTENTIALLY- AIRBORNE

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:54.215
DISEASES- SIXTY EIGHT WE KNOW

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:57.819
THAT THE PLAN DOES NOT CONSIDER-

01:25:57.886 --> 01:25:58.953
THAT ISSUE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:02.957
CONCERNS- AND- LOCAL EXPERTS

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:05.393
HAVE TESTIFIED IN COURT THAT THE

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.661
ARCHITECTURE IN PARTICULAR AT

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:07.529
SAN QUENTIN HAS BEEN

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.097
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC DURING

KOBE AND- AND- OTHER PRISONS.

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:12.634
WELL THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.068
SCRUTINIZED AS CLOSELY AS SAN

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:15.937
QUENTIN COULD HAVE SIMILAR

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:19.440
CONCERNS- AND SO THE MAIN POINT

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.543
HERE THE MAIN TAKEAWAY WHETHER

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:22.944
WHETHER OR NOT ONE VIEWS A

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.812
SUPPORT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION- IT DOES

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:29.584

INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ON THE

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:37.158
ONE HAND MAY INCLUDE PROJECTS

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:39.427
THAT WON'T ALTER THAT ULTIMATELY

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.829
BE NEEDED BECAUSE- THOSE

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:42.797
PARTICULAR FACILITIES MAY

ULTIMATELY BE CLOSED DUE TO

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.167
DECLINE IN THE NEED FOR PRISON

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:49.203

PROJECTS THAT WILL BE NEEDED-

01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:55.176
GIVEN THAT IT DIDN'T- GET OUT

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:56.511
THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T CONDUCT A

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:59.547
SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF.

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:01.649
CERTAIN ISSUES THAT HAVE KEEN

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:04.452

THE NOTES NOTE THAT HERE WE HAVE

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:32.447
THIS KIND OF ISSUE CATCH TWENTY

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:33.247
TWO WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:34.716

TO. GO OUT WITH THAT THERE ARE

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:44.392
PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE OR CLOSE

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.027
CERTAIN FACILITIES SO I GUESS MY

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.997
QUESTION FOR. THE BELLAGIO HOW

YOU ASKING FOR HOW DO YOU AVOID

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.713
APPROVING. SORT OF A PLAN FOR

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.182
HOW TO AVOID APPROVING EDS

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:11.019
PROJECTS YES AND HOW DO WE GET

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:12.987
TO SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE- YOU

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.658
WE'RE NOT HAVING THE SAME

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:17.325
CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR- WELL WE

01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:19.827
HAVE. RECOMMENDED IN THE PAST

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:21.396
THAT THE LEGISLATURE. WRITTEN

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:23.631
DIRECTED DEPARTMENT TO REQUIRE

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:25.566
TO REPORT A LIST OF PRISONS THAT

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.802
IT VIEWS AS- STRONG CANDIDATES

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:30.338
FOR CLOSURE- AND WE'VE SUGGESTED

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:31.873
CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT THE

01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:33.508
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IN.

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:34.842
DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:28:34.909 --> 01:28:36.110
REPORT THAT LAST A LITTLE BLOOD

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:38.212
SUGAR COULD OF COURSE- DEVELOP

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:40.848
ITS OWN CRITERIA- DOT HAS NOT

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:44.252
RESULTED IN- THE MINISTRATION.

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:47.989
PROVIDING PRISONS OR OR EVEN

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:51.092
INDICATING- SORT OF A STRATEGY

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.161
WITH RESPECT TO. WHETHER IT

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:55.363
INTENDS TO CLOSE PRISONS VERSES

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:57.832
CLOSE PORTIONS OF PRISONS AS IT

01:28:57.899 --> 01:28:59.934
HAS IT HAS IT DONE BOTH IN

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:02.970
RECENT YEARS- ANOTHER OPTION OF

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:04.272
THE LEGISLATURE COULD PURSUE

01:29:04.338 --> 01:29:06.674
COULD BE TO- IDENTIFY PRISONS

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:08.242
THAT IT THINKS. ARE STRONG GET

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:09.644
CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE AND THEN

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:11.379
SIMPLY NOT APPROVED-

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:14.248
SIGNIFICANT- YOU KNOW- OR LONG

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:16.484
TERM. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:19.120
AT THOSE PRESENTS- WE HAVE

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:23.491
IDENTIFIED PRISON AT WHICH I.

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.426
TEST ON LAST YEAR WHICH WERE

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:26.994

CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:39.674
AS STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:43.277
BASED ON THEIR- PRIMARILY THEIR

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:44.779
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE WHAT WAS

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:47.949
THAT PRIOR TO THIS REPORT- VERY

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.117
SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:52.587
CURRENT NEEDS ADDS ESTIMATED BY-

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:53.755
AN EXTERNAL CONSULTING FIRM

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:56.524
KITCHELL- AS WELL AS THEIR

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:58.259
OPERATIONAL COSTS PER INMATE-

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:00.628
CDCR DOESN'T THINK BASED ON THIS

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:02.296
REPORT THAT THE STATE WILL

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:04.332
ULTIMATELY NEED TO INVEST MAKE

01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:05.199
INVESTMENTS IN THE

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:08.169
INFRASTRUCTURE- ON THE SCALE

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:10.271
THAT CONTROL RECOMMENDED. BUT

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:12.406
NEVERTHELESS THESE FACILITIES DO

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:15.977
SEEM TO HAVE ON BALANCE SOME

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:16.377
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:18.980
INFRASTRUCTURE- ISSUES. SO

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:20.214
THAT'S ANOTHER APPROACH THE

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.649
LOGISTIC LEGISLATURE COULD

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:26.187
CONSIDER. AM I ANSWERING YOUR

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.322

THE PREMISE OF THE B. ELLIE OWES

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:39.834
ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS HOW HOW

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:42.170
SHOULD WE THE LEGISLATURE BE

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:44.639
THINKING SMARTLY ABOUT THIS.

01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:46.174
WE'LL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.875
THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE YOU MAKE

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.177
THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS ARE

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:52.980
PROJECTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR

01:30:53.047 --> 01:30:55.783
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND.

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.385
NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS TO TRY TO

01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:00.788
IMPACT THERE BUT I THINK THAT-

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.924
THEY WORK THE REPORT IS

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.692
DISCUSSING A LOT OF THE

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.893
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AT THESE

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.729
PRISONS BUT I THINK CDC OURS-

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:10.498
ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT IS AT C.

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:12.567
C. R. DOES NOT FEEL THAT THE

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:13.467
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE THE

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:15.536
DRIVER OF ANY FUTURE PRISON

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:18.940
CLOSURE DECISIONS- THE CDCR

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:20.942

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:30.718
CONSIDERATIONS- THE ABILITY TO

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.486
STAFF PRISONS IT'S MUCH MORE

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:34.922
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATION FOR

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:36.123
THAT RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:38.526
WOULD BE DRIVEN BY A PRIMARILY

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:40.628
INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED REPORT

01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:43.331
REPORT- AND I WOULD JUST SAY

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:45.433
IT'S NOT- THAT NOT NECESSARILY

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:46.601
UNDER MY PURVIEW BUT I THINK

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.703
THAT APARTMENT HAS. TESTIFIED

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:50.271
AND IN MAY THE POSITIONS IN THE

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:54.008
PAST THAT IT HAS- IT IT DOES NOT

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:55.710
AGREE WITH THE CONCEPT OF

01:31:55.776 --> 01:31:57.645
PUTTING OUT A LIST OF PRISONS TO

01:31:57.712 --> 01:31:59.447
CLOSE- OR THAT COULD BE

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:00.648
CONSIDERED FOR CLOSURE- DUE TO

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:01.549
WHAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:02.617
DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS THAT WOULD

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:04.051
OCCUR AT THOSE PRISONS-

01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:06.153
REGARDING STAFFING AND OTHER

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.723
CONSIDERATIONS. SO I GUESS WHAT

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.591
I WANT TO GO BACK TO IS LANGUAGE

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:12.660

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:14.729

LONG TERM STRATEGY AND HERE WE

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:14.815
ARE- A YEAR LATER. WOULD

FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME

01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:19.286
QUESTIONS- THIS IS DEJA VU- SO

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:21.022
SIMILAR TO THE DISCUSSION THAT

PRISONS TO BE CLOSED. WE ARE

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:34.168
ASKING TO HAVE A PLAN A

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:37.438
STRATEGY- SO THAT WE CAN FILL

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:39.774
OUR RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE WE DO

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.476
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. NOT ONLY

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:43.077
TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

INCARCERATED- MAKE SURE THAT

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:46.414
THEY HAVE SAFE CONDITIONS BUT

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.284
ALSO TO THE INVESTMENTS OF THE-

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:54.388
THE TAX DOLLARS. THAT WE MANAGE-

01:34:54.455 --> 01:34:56.357
THE POPULATION OF THE PRISON

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:58.659

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:02.229
WHAT THOSE TRENDS ARE- WE NEED

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:03.230
TO LOOK AT THOSE AND MAKE

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:06.934
INFORMED DECISIONS- ARE YOU YOU

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:09.403
MAKE PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE SIZE

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:11.405
FOR EXAMPLE AND OF. CERTAIN

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:13.874
GROUPS THE AGE DISTRIBUTION THE

KINDS OF HEALTH NEEDS- THERE'S

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:20.214
SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT.

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:22.249
FRANKLY MANY ALL DEPARTMENTS

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:24.185
ACROSS OUR OUR STATE AND

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.086
GOVERNMENT ARE ASKED TO MAKE

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:29.657

THAT DOESN'T WANT TO PROVIDE

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:38.165
THAT VISION ON THE PLAN TO US.

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:40.668

US WELL WE'RE IN THIS REACTIVE

01:35:43.704 --> 01:35:46.607
