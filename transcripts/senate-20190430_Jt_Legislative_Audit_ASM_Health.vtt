DIAGNOSED AND TREATED AS EARLY

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:20.418
AS POSSIBLE. ONE KEY REASON THAT

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:21.553
CHILDREN DO NOT RECEIVE

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:18.583
STUDY THAT WAS DONE BACK IN.

TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:20.852
UTILIZATION RATES OVER THE FIVE

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:21.886
YEAR WINDOW THAT WE LOOKED AT

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:24.989
WAS WHICH WAS FISCAL YEAR.

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:26.257
TWELVE THIRTEEN THROUGH

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:27.125
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT RANGED

00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:29.026
BETWEEN FORTY EIGHT AND 50% SO

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:32.029
STILL A LOW PERCENTAGE --

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:33.965
UTILIZATION RATE FOR CALIFORNIA

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:37.134
CHILDREN -- WHAT THAT EQUATES TO

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:38.603
FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE IN MEDI CAL

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:40.071
IS ON AVERAGE THERE ARE TWO

00:35:40.137 --> 00:35:41.672
POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN AT

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:43.574
ANY PARTICULAR YEAR LOSS FIVE

SERVICES SOME OF THOSE CHILDREN

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:52.483
MAY READ BE RECEIVING SOME

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.751
SERVICES BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:55.086
FULL BREADTH.

00:35:55.152 --> 00:35:56.354
OF SERVICES ARE PREVENTIVE

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.855

CHILDREN -- AS YOU.

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:02.527
IF YOU COULD TURN TO PAGE TWO ON

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:04.161
THE HAND OUT WE HAVE A MAP THAT

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:05.663
IS SHOWN IN THE AUDIT REPORT WE

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.198
WE HAVE JUST A FEW GRAPHICS THAT

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:08.766
ARE EXCERPTS FROM THE PORCH WHAT

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.334
THIS GRAPH SHOWS YOUR THIS

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:11.135
PICTURE OF THE STATE OF

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:11.836
CALIFORNIA.

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:13.337
IS THE UTILIZATION RATES BY

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:15.806
COUNTY AND AS YOU CAN SEE.

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.975
EASTERN A CALIFORNIA RURAL

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:19.577
COUNTIES REALLY HAVE A MUCH

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:21.679
LOWER UTILIZATION RATE -- THEN

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:24.015
COUNTIES AND MORE URBAN AREAS

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:25.816
COASTAL AREAS IT'S CENTER BUT

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.451
STILL THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT --

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:31.155
ISSUES WITH RESPECT UTILIZATION

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:31.656
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:31.956
CALIFORNIA.

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.925
SO WHY IS THAT WE WERE LOOKING

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:36.427
TO DETERMINE ACCESS TO CARE SO A

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:37.895
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE LOOKED

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:39.564
AT WITH RESPECT -- TO

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.166
ACCESSIBILITY AND TWENTY

AFTER GUIDANCE CAME OUT FROM THE

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:46.437
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.372
TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.774
SPECIFIC STANDARDS THAT A

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.143
MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE NETWORKS

00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:53.010
ARE SUPPOSED.

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.979
TO MEET THAT ARE SHOWN ON PAGE

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:55.780
THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT IT'S A

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:58.215
TABLE THAT THAT BASICALLY LAYS

00:36:58.282 --> 00:37:00.017
OUT FOR PRIMARY CARE IT USUALLY

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:01.519
WITHIN TEN MILES OR THIRTY

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:04.689
MINUTES. FOR A A BENEFICIARY

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.257
HAVE TO TRAVEL TO GET CARE.

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:07.925
THROUGH MANTA THROUGH A MANAGED

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:09.860
CARE PLAN OR A NETWORK -- WHAT

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:12.229
WE FOUND IS THAT CERTAINLY

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.264
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:15.399
PUT THAT THE THE THOSE --

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:16.801
STANDARDS OUT THERE FOR

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:19.337
PROVIDERS TO TO TRY TO MEET --

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.538
BUT THERE WAS ALSO STATE LAW

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:22.740
THAT ALLOWED PROVIDERS MANAGED

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:25.610
CARE PLANS EXCUSE ME TO SEEK

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:27.612
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT PARTICULAR

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:28.479
STANDARD.

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:31.148
ARMS AND AND WHAT WE SAW AND I

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:32.883
THINK HEALTH CARE SERVICES WOULD

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:33.751
WOULD.

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:35.086
TESTIFY TO THEY WERE QUITE

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:35.953
SURPRISED BECAUSE THEY GOT A

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.055
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF REQUEST

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:40.257
FOR EXCEPTIONS IT WAS UPWARDS OF

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:40.858
EIGHTY THOUSAND MANY OF THOSE

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.526
WERE IN COMPLETE SO THEY THEY

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.328
WEREN'T REALLY EVEN CONSIDERED.

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:45.730
BUT DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES

00:37:45.796 --> 00:37:48.265
APPROVED NEARLY TEN THOUSAND OF

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:49.433
THESE EXCEPTIONS THAT PLANS

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.668
ASKED.

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:52.503
FOR AS FAR AS WE CAN'T MEET THAT

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:53.871
PARTICULAR STANDARD WE HAVE AN

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.906
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD THAT

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:57.241
WE WOULD LIKE THE DEPARTMENT TO

00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:59.910
APPROVE -- AND OF THOSE TEN

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:04.015
THOUSAND THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:04.548
ABOUT.

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:05.182
SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED WITH RESPECT

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:05.783
TO PROVIDERS WHO ARE PROVIDING

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.917
SERVICES FOR CHILDREN SO YOU'RE

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.419
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:09.820
ACCESS STANDARDS THAT DON'T

00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:11.088
NECESSARILY MEET.

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.356
THE ONES THAT WERE ESTABLISHED

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:14.125
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CERTAINLY A

00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:15.793
PROCESS THAT THAT WAS YOU KNOW

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.361
AUTHORIZED IN LAW BUT THERE WAS

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:19.030
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:21.065
ACCESS STANDARDS THAT. FOR WHICH

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.767
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS NOW THE

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.135
CONCERN WE IDENTIFIED IN THE

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:26.437
REPORT -- IS THAT SOME OF THESE.

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.706
ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS WERE VERY

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:30.441
EXTREME AN EXCESSIVE OFF FOR

00:38:30.508 --> 00:38:32.610
PARTICULAR TYPES OF SPECIALTIES

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:35.079
OR EVEN FOR PRIMARY CARE WHERE

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:37.314
BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE EXPECTED

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:39.650
TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES --

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:41.919
POTENTIALLY HOURS JUST TO GET TO

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:44.955
A PARTICULAR -- PROVIDER TO GET

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.991
CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND SO

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.392
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:38:48.459 --> 00:38:50.227
SERVICES WAS REALLY FOCUSING ON

00:38:50.294 --> 00:38:51.128
DID THE PLAN.

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:52.630
DO ITS DUE DILIGENCE IN TRYING

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:55.566
TO FIND PROVIDERS THAT COULD --

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:56.934
PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE

00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:59.303
CHILDREN WITHIN THE EGG THE THE

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.571
TYPICAL STANDARDS THAT THAT --

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:01.939
THIRTY MINUTES TEN MILES IF THEY

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.407
COULDN'T DO THAT THEN DID THEY

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:06.510
PUT TOGETHER -- A PROPOSAL THAT

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:10.481
SEEMED REASONABLE -- THAT MET

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:11.882
THE REQUIREMENTS BUT AND I

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:12.683
CORRECT MYSELF THE

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.984
REASONABLENESS SO THEY WEREN'T

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:15.419
REALLY LOOKING TO SEE OKAY THEY

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:16.854
PROPOSED AN ALTERNATIVE STANDARD

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:17.521
THAT.

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:19.523
WE HAVE TO DRIVE THREE HUNDRED

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.826
FIFTY MILES TO TAKE MY CHILD TO

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.694
A PARTICULAR SPECIALIST IS THAT

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:25.663
REASONABLE THAT THAT WASN'T

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.198
REALLY THE FOCUS OF THE

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.399
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:30.301
DECISION MAKING WHEN APPROVING

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:31.435
SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:32.703
STANDARDS SO EVEN THOUGH THEY

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.338
WERE PROVED AGAIN AND AND

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:37.041
BENEFICIARY WHO'S IN MEDI CAL.

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:38.442
GETTING SERVICES FROM PROVIDERS

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:39.543
ARE TYPICALLY LOW INCOME

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:40.778
FAMILIES THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:42.847
ABILITY TO DRIVE THREE HUNDRED

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:44.348
MILES OR THEY MAY HAVE MAY NOT

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.617
HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO THAT.

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:48.085
SO UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THOSE

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:50.087
CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:53.824
TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT THEY

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.626
NEED -- THE OTHER THE OTHER

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.694
ISSUE WE HAD WITH RESPECT TO

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:57.762
THIS IS THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.597
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE.

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:01.432
A PLAN WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:03.501
ALLOW THAT BEEN IF YOU SHARE IN

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:05.069
THAT CHILD TO SEEK.

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.504
CARE FROM A PROVIDER WHO'S OUT

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.372
OF PLAN SO MAY NOT BE IN THE

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:10.307
NETWORK BUT MAYBE MUCH CLOSER

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:11.609
THAN WHAT THAT ALTERNATIVE

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:13.477
STANDARD IS SUGGESTING MUCH

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:14.278
CLOSER THAN THE THREE HUNDRED

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:15.045
MILES.

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.680
THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE --

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.382
THE PLAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO AND

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.717
SHOULD.

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:21.285
NOTIFY THOSE BENEFICIARIES WE

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:22.253
DON'T HAVE A PROVIDER IN OUR

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:24.255
NETWORK BUT WE HAVE ONE CLOSE BY

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:25.723
WHERE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHILD.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.458
AND AND DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.859
SERVICES WAS NOT ENSURING THAT

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:31.028
THE PLANS WERE NOTIFYING AND

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.797
LETTING THOSE BENEFICIARIES KNOW

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:34.498
THAT YOU DO HAVE OPTIONS.

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.801
RATHER THAN DRIVING THREADED

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:38.702
MILES YOU CAN GET CARE -- CLOSER

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:39.303
BY.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:39.904
NOW SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.705
THAT WE LOOKED AT WITH RESPECT

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.207
TO ACCESS TO CARE AND AND MISTER

00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:44.308
SALAS TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.210
BIT IN HIS OPENING COMMENTS IS

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:47.812
THE SUPPLIER PROVIDERS.

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.180
WHY DON'T WE HAVE AS A STATE OF

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:51.882
CALIFORNIA HAVE MORE PROVIDERS --

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.217
WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN MEDI

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:55.653
CAL -- IN PART OF THE CONCERN NO

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:56.754
SURPRISE TO MEMBERS A

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.022
LEGISLATURE THE REIMBURSEMENT

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.356
RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE QUITE

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:01.258
LOW SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:03.494
COUNTRY -- THERE ARE ONLY

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:05.029
ACCORDING TO A STUDY DONE BY

00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:06.697
KAISER BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:07.498
THERE WERE ONLY TWO OTHER STATES

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:09.033
THAT HAVE LOWER REIMBURSEMENT

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.401
RATES.

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:11.936
THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:12.803
NOW WE HAVE TO SAY THE

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.171
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:16.240
IS TRYING -- TO HAS DEVELOPED

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.441
THE RECRUITING PROGRAM AN

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:19.210
INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO TRY TO GET

00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:20.544
PHYSICIANS.

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:22.279
AND PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA TO

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:24.148
PARTICIPATE IN -- THE MEDI CAL

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.483
SYSTEM BY PROVIDING SOME TUITION

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:29.019
RELIEF -- AND SO THAT'S A GOOD

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.788
THAT'S A GOOD STEP FORWARD THEY

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:33.290
ALSO BE AN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.458
USING PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY TO

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.093
BACK OF TAX MONEY. TO ALSO

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.162
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:40.164
PROVIDERS THE CONCERN WE HAVE

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:41.465
WITH THE PROP FIFTY SIX IT'S A

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:43.634
GREAT STEP IT'S A GREAT OPTION.

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.336
BUT THAT FUNDING STREAM IS NOT

00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:47.538
NECESSARILY A STABLE CONSISTENT

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:49.707
RELIABLE FUNDING STREAM SO SOME

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:51.175
PROVIDERS MAY BE RELUCTANT. TO

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:52.610
PUT AGAIN PARTICIPATE IN MEDI

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.578
CAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T VIEW THAT

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:59.083
AS A A RELIABLE.

00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:00.484
SOURCE OF FUNDING.

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:01.485
I'M ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:02.286
WE WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.854
SOME OTHER STATES USE PAY FOR

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.923
PERFORMANCE -- TO INCENTIVIZE

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.425
PROVIDERS -- TO PRO PROVIDE

00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:10.761
ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO CHILDREN --

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:13.497
AND TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:15.499
THEY AREN'T NECESSARILY HOLDING

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:17.301
PLANS ACCOUNTABLE THIS IS THE

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:18.369
DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:18.836
AGAIN.

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:20.504
WE HAVE TO PAY FOR PERFORMANCE

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:21.238
AND THE PLANS ARE UNDER

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:23.207
PERFORMING THEN WE'VE GOT TO

00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:24.541
HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:27.244
PARTICULAR EXPECTATIONS.

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:28.679
SO THAT FIRST SECTION OF THE

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:31.215
REPORT WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:33.417
CARE UTILIZATION RATES -- THAT

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:34.919
THE NEXT STEP THAT WE LOOKED AT

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.787
IS OKAY WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:37.988
DOES DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.890
SERVICES PROVIDE WHAT TYPES OF

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:40.824
OVERSIGHT.

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:42.526
ACTIVITIES ARE THEY PERFORMING

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:43.894
TO MAKE SURE THAT MANAGED CARE

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:46.530
PLANS AND PROVIDERS ARE ACTUALLY

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:48.232
PROVIDING SERVICES TO CHILDREN

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:50.067
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.402
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS.

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:52.202
AND WE THANK THE DEPARTMENT

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:53.537
HEALTH CARE SERVICES COULD DO A

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:56.006
BETTER JOB OF MAKING CLEAR THE

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:58.142
EXPECTATIONS OF THE STATE OF

00:42:58.208 --> 00:43:00.177
CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT.

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.445
TO THE TYPES OF PREVENTIVE

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:04.014
SERVICES THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:05.149
RECEIVING THAT IT'S IT'S A

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:06.583
SCHEDULE CALL BRIGHT FUTURE

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.352
SCHEDULE WHICH LAYS OUT

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:10.254
IMMUNIZATION SCREENINGS OTHER

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:12.222
TYPES OF SERVICES PREVENTIVE

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:13.557
SERVICES THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.292
RECEIVING THAT PROVIDER SHOULD

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:15.459
BE.

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:18.662
OFFERING TO BENEFICIARIES -- AND

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:19.697
WHAT WE SAW AS A DEPARTMENT

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:21.398
HEALTH CARE SERVICES MAY HAVE

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.800
LAID OUT THOSE EXPECTATIONS BUT

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:24.335
THEY WEREN'T CLEAR.

00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:26.337
NOT ONLY TO THEIR PLANS BUT ARE

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.905
NOT CLEAR TO THE PROVIDERS SO

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:29.473
THERE NEEDS TO BE A BETTER JOB

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.976
OF INFORMING BOTH PLANS AND

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.844
PROVIDERS AND WHAT IS EXPECTED --

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:35.212
WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES FOR

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:36.213
CHILDREN THROUGH THIS BRIGHT

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.983
FUTURES -- SCHEDULE.

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:40.317
IN ADDITION THERE IS A REPAIR

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:42.086
THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:43.520
STATE HAS TO ANNUALLY AND FORM

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:45.322
FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WHO HAVEN'T

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:47.324
USED.

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.226
EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING -- E.

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:51.061
P. S. T. D. T. R. SCREENING

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:53.197
DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT IF IF

00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:54.431
THERE ARE BENEFICIARIES IN THE

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:55.899
MEDICAL SYSTEM THAT ARE NOT

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:56.633
AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THOSE

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.369
TYPES OF SERVICES THERE'S A

00:43:58.435 --> 00:44:00.070
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE STATE. TO

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:01.405
INFORM FAMILIES THAT THESE

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:04.041
SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.943
AND THAT YOUR CHILDREN SHOULD BE

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.911
ABLE TO TO GAIN ACCESS TO THOSE

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.446
PARTICULAR SERVICES SO THE STATE

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:10.948
IS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB.

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:13.050
OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.151
BEING COMMUNICATED TO

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:15.586
BENEFICIARIES WHEN WE TALK TO

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:16.453
THE DEPARTMENT THEY SAID WELL

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.356
WE'RE DEFERRING TO THE PLANS TO

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:21.225
INFORM THE BENEFICIARIES WELL WE

00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:22.593
TALKED TO SOME OF THE PLANS

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:24.028
DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT.

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:25.129
AND NONE OF THE PLANS THAT WE

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:28.599
SPOKE WITH ACTUALLY ARE DOING

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:29.733
THAT MAY CAN SURE THAT

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.267
BENEFICIARIES ARE AWARE.

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:31.335
OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.037
AVAILABLE TO THEM.

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:35.506
NOW ONE THING WE DID FIND THAT

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:39.710
WE THINK IS -- INDICATIVE OF

00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:40.210
AWAY THAT THE STATE OF

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:41.678
CALIFORNIA -- DEPARTMENT HEALTH

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:42.913
CARE SERVICES ARE THE STATE CAN

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.615
ACTUALLY INCREASE UTILIZATION

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:47.117
RATES ON PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:48.652
OUT THERE IS A GRAPHIC THAT WE

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:49.953
HAD IN THE AUDIT REPORT.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.755
THAT REALLY DEMONSTRATES AS YOU

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.524
CAN SEE AGES THREE THROUGH SIX

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.025
WHERE WE PUT A BOX AROUND THOSE

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:56.126
AGES.

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:58.996
THOSE ARE SPECIFIC AGE GROUPS

00:44:59.063 --> 00:44:59.630
WHERE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:00.330
SERVICES.

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:02.132
REALLY EXPECTS AND THEY HAVE

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.767
DEVELOPED PERFORMANCE METRICS

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:05.903
FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO MEET

00:45:05.969 --> 00:45:07.738
AND TO REPORT ON SO WHEN THINGS

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:10.007
ARE BEING MEASURED ACTIVITY IS

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:11.308
IS HAPPENING.

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.776
SO YOU CAN SEE THE UTILIZATION

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.311
RATES FOR CHILDREN IN THOSE AGE

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:16.447
GROUPS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:17.414
THAN MOST OF THE OTHER AGE

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:20.050
GROUPS ACROSS THAT SCALE --

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:21.185
CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME THERE

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:23.754
PARTICULARLY LOW AGE -- TO VERY

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:26.323
VERY LOW BUT BUT THE METRICS AND

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.759
IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE FIVE THIS IS

00:45:28.826 --> 00:45:31.061
A TABLE THAT SHOWS.

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:33.263
THE VARIOUS TYPES OF SERVICES

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.498
THROUGH BRIGHT FUTURES I WAS

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:35.933
REFERRING TO AND YOU CAN SEE THE

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.434
COLUMN THAT HAS THREE TO SIX

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:38.102
YEARS.

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:39.636
THEY ARE CHECKING THEY HAVE

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:41.371
ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE MEASURES

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:43.073
FOR THAT AGE GROUP FOR ALL OF

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:43.774
THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:45.843
SERVICES AND IN AND LOOKING BACK

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:47.244
ON THE ON THE GRAPH THE PRIOR

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.079
PAGE YOU CAN SEE THE UTILIZATION

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.614
RATES. FOR THOSE PARTICULAR

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:53.317
CHILDREN ARE MUCH MUCH HIGHER --

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:56.220
THAN ANY OF THE OTHER AGES --

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:57.955
ZERO THROUGH THROUGH.

00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.389
TWENTY SO WHAT THAT DEMONSTRATES

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.624
IS IF YOU ESTABLISH THE METRICS

00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:02.092
AND YOU HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:03.861
THEY AND PROVIDERS WILL PROVIDE

00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:05.329
THOSE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN IN

00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:06.964
CALIFORNIA.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.166
WE ALSO LOOKED AT ANNUAL AUDITS

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:10.434
THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.269
SERVICES CONDUCTS TO DETERMINE

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:13.704
WHETHER OR NOT PLANS ACTUALLY

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.405
HAVE THE UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT

00:46:15.472 --> 00:46:17.774
PROGRAM -- MANY OF THE PLANS DO

00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:19.510
BUT WHAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:20.577
NOT INSURING.

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:21.845
IS THAT WHETHER OR NOT THESE

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:24.481
PLANS ARE TAKING THE ACTIONS

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.382
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SO

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:26.550
THEY HAVE A UTILIZATION

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:27.684
MANAGEMENT PLAN THEY WANT TO

00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:28.519
INCREASE.

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.053
ACCESS TO CARE THEY WANT TO

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.722
INCREASE UTILIZATION HEALTH CARE

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:33.223
SERVICES IS NOT HOLDING THOSE

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:34.758
PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO WHAT

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:36.393
SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GOING TO DO

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.529
TO ADDRESS THE LOW UTILIZATION

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:40.364
RATES THAT YOU'RE PROVIDERS.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:44.134
ARE YOUR DATA DEMONSTRATES.

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:45.202
IN ADDITION RELATED TO EARLY

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:48.005
PERIODIC SCREENING -- SERVICES

00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:49.540
FOR CHILDREN D. D. H. U. S.

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:51.141
HEALTHCARE SERVICES JUST BEGAN

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:53.777
AUDITING AND LOOKING AT THOSE

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:56.180
TYPES OF SERVICES JUST LAST FALL

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:57.848
FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.283
AGAIN WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.184
PROCEDURES THEY'RE REVIEWING A

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.919
VERY SMALL NUMBER OF THE SERVICE

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.220
IS NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:03.420
ALL.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.422
OF THEM AND LOOKING AT A VERY

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:07.157
SMALL NUMBER OF CHILDREN SO WE

00:47:07.224 --> 00:47:07.791
THINK THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:10.093
JOB -- IN CONDUCTING THAT WORK

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.862
AS WELL SO REALLY TRYING TO HOLD

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:13.997
PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO TRY TO GET

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.199
THEM.

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:16.700
TO INCREASE PROVIDE SERVICES AN

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:19.102
INCREASE UTILIZATION RATES FOR

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.237
CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA.

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:22.172
A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES RELATED

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:23.607
TO ACCESS AND PROVISION OF

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.776
SERVICES -- ANOTHER QUESTION

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:27.544
THAT MR WOOD HAD WAS RELATED TO

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.646
CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS SO

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:31.548
WHAT ARE THE PLANS DOING TO MAKE

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.250
SURE THAT BENEFICIARIES WHO

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.185
SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE --

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:36.720
ARE FROM A DIFFERENT CULTURE

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:39.323
REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:41.558
BRIGHT FUTURES THE AVAILABILITY

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.093
OF SERVICES THE AND THE THE

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.761
ELIGIBILITY THAT THEIR CHILDREN

SO THEY HAVE THE DATA BUT THE

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:21.131
PLANS ARE REALLY NOT FOLLOWING

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:23.166
UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:24.735
DOING ANYTHING ABOUT.

00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:26.036
THOSE PARTICULAR.

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.104
BENEFICIARIES WHO MAY HAVE A

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.306
LANGUAGE BARRIER AGAIN THEY'RE

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:31.375
RELYING ON THE PROVIDER -- TO

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:33.010
EITHER PROVIDE LANGUAGE SERVICES

00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:34.144
OR THEY'RE EXPECTING THE

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:36.580
BENEFICIARIES TO ASK FOR A

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:38.115
TRANSLATION -- TRANSLATOR

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:39.650
SOMEONE TO ASSIST SO THERE AND

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:40.951
WHAT THE STATE IS NOT REALLY

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:45.122
BEING PROACTIVE IN MAKING SURE

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:48.158
THAT PLAN AND AND PROVIDERS ARE

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:48.892
ARE ADDRESSING THOSE THOSE

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.093
CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.861
THE LAST SECTION OF THE REPORT

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:52.362
TALKS ABOUT SOME INCENTIVES --

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:53.664
WE LOOKED AT SOME OTHER STATES

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:54.431
THAT ACTUALLY HAVE SOME

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:55.866
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE

00:48:55.932 --> 00:48:57.467
THOUGHT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL TO

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:58.769
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE THINK

00:48:58.835 --> 00:48:59.336
THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:00.404
SERVICES.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.172
SHOULD LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE ONE

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:03.840
OF THOSE IS IS A STATE THAT

00:49:03.907 --> 00:49:05.575
INCLUDES -- THE BRIGHT FUTURE

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:06.943
SCHEDULE AND SOME OF THE

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.645
PAMPHLETS OR THE INFORMATION

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:10.347
THAT'S PROVIDED TO BENEFICIARIES

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.948
SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:13.083
DIFFERENT INCENTIVES THAT WE

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.284
THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.820
SHOULD LOOK AT I'M IN ADDITION

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:18.855
TO THAT THERE'S A REVIEWS THAT

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:20.490
ARE DONE BY AN EXTERNAL QUALITY

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.291
REVIEW.

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:22.993
TEAM IT'S A REQUIREMENT AND THEY

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.861
THEY LOOK AT ACCESS TO CARE THEY

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:26.663
LOOK AT QUALITY OF CARE WHAT WE

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.298
FOUND IS THOSE REVIEWS ARE BEING

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:29.833
DONE BUT AGAIN THE FOLLOW UP

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.568
ISN'T HAPPENING TO MAKE SURE

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:32.002
THAT.

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:33.437
ANY ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:35.138
IDENTIFIED IN THOSE REVIEWS ARE

00:49:35.205 --> 00:49:36.773
BEING ADDRESSED AND HOPEFULLY

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.408
RESOLVED SO WE CAN GET THE

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:40.310
UTILIZATION RATES UP -- AND HAVE

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:41.945
CHILDREN GET ACCESS TO

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:43.880
PREVENTIVE CARE THAT THEY NEED.

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.382
SO THAT IS A KIND OF AA QUICK

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.884
OVERVIEW OF OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:49.353
WE IDENTIFIED IN THERE AND THE

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:50.420
AUDIT REPORT WHAT MISTER HOOPER

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.888

THE LEGISLATURE.

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.628
AND THEN SOMEBODY ADDITIONAL

00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:00.697
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:01.531
THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE

00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:12.142
ISSUES IN THE REPORT -- AND WE

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:12.909
MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:14.978
THOSE ISSUES -- WE HAVE A

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:16.680
SUMMARY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.682
ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT.

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:19.983
WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BOTH

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.220
OF THE LEGISLATURE AND TO DH CS.

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:24.621
WE MADE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:25.889
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:27.391
THE FIRST ADDRESSES THE ACCESS

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.392
ISSUE.

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:31.361
BY REQUIRING DH CS TO MODIFY THE

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:32.929
CRITERIA THAT IT USES FOR

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:34.631
APPROVING ITS ALTERNATIVE ACCESS

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.800
STANDARDS. TO CONSIDER THE

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:39.770
REASON ABILITY OF THOSE -- OF

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.972
THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS

00:50:42.038 --> 00:50:43.306
STANDARDS.

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:46.643
THEN IF A PLAN IS UNABLE TO MEET --

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.512
REASONABLE ACCESS STANDARDS. TO

00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:50.680
REQUIRE THOSE PLANS TO ALLOW OUT

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:52.516
OF NETWORK ACCESS.

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:55.352
NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE A DH CS

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:56.720
SHOULD REQUIRE THOSE PLANS TO

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:57.988
INFORM THE MEMBERS THAT ARE

00:50:58.054 --> 00:51:00.223
AFFECTED THAT THEY CAN ACCESS

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:01.925
THESE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS.

00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:02.859
AND IT SHOULD REQUIRE THE

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:04.161
PROVIDER OR THE PLANTS

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:06.797

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:09.065
MEMBERS IN.

00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:10.967
IN FINDING THOSE PROVIDERS.

00:51:11.034 --> 00:51:12.035
OUR SECOND LEGISLATIVE

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:13.937
RECOMMENDATION ADDRESSES THE

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.806
REIMBURSEMENT RATES ISSUE.

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.808
BY HAVING BY DIRECTING DH CS

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:19.109
IMPLEMENT A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:20.544
PROGRAM THAT SPECIFICALLY

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.846
TARGETS THE UTILIZATION

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.448
CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE SERVICES.

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:26.183
TO THE EXTENT THAT.

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:28.518
DHS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT'S

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:29.252
GOING TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:30.654
FUNDING.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.022
IT SHOULD I'D ASK THE

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:33.523
LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE FUNDING

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:37.194
SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PURPOSE.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.696
WE ALSO HAD RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:40.297
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:41.398
SERVICES.

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:43.233
OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION IN THE

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.703
SUMMARIES -- TO I'D USE THE

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.271
TOOLS THAT DH CS ALREADY HAS

00:51:48.338 --> 00:51:50.006
THIS WITH THE BY THE TIME WE

00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:51.575
ACCESS STUDY.

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:52.742
AND THE THE DATA THAT IS

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.077
COLLECTED FROM THOSE ALTERNATIVE

00:51:54.144 --> 00:51:57.314
ACCESS STANDARDS REQUESTS TO

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.648
IDENTIFY AREAS IN THE STATE.

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.016
WHERE IT SHOULD TARGET ITS

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:01.718
RECRUITING EFFORTS AND AS THE

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:02.786
STATE AUDITOR SAID?

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:04.387
DTS IS ALREADY WORKING USING

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:07.924
PROPS FIFTY SIX FUNDING OF FOR

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:09.292
SOME RECRUITMENT EFFORTS.

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:11.127
BUT THOSE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS

00:52:11.194 --> 00:52:11.728
ARE.

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:14.464
NOT TARGETED TO CHILDREN'S

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:16.299
PREVENTIVE SERVICES -- AND THEY

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:21.505
AREN'T UTILIZING -- CONSISTENT

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:23.607
LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE.

00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:25.008
THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION TO

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:25.575
TAKE PART IN OF HEALTH CARE

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:28.245
SERVICES -- IS THAT IT SHOULD

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.914
UTILIZED -- PERFORMANCE MEASURES

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.282
FOR ALL AGE GROUPS AND NOT JUST

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:33.817
THOSE SPECIFIC AGE GROUPS THAT

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:36.152
WE SAW -- ON PAGE FOUR OF THE

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.454
HAND OUT THERE.

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:40.156
WE'VE SEEN THAT THE I

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:42.158
PERFORMANCE MEASURES WHAT YOU

00:52:42.225 --> 00:52:43.894
MEASURE IS WHAT GETS IMPROVED

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.828
AND SO SINCE THERE IS A

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.396
SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:48.031
INCREASED UTILIZATION AND THOSE

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:49.432
PERFORMANCE MEASURES WE

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:51.301
RECOMMENDED THAT DH CS IMPLEMENT

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:53.270
THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES. FOR

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:55.772
CHILDREN OF ALL AGES.

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.040
WE'VE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT DH

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:59.309
CS SHOULD EXPANDED IT'S AUDIT

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.544
PROCEDURES IN ITS ANNUAL MEDICAL

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.879
AUDITS TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:04.481
CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE SERVICES

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.383
CONSISTENTLY AND FOR ALL

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:08.251
CHILDREN.

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:10.820
WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:11.354
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:12.255
SERVICES.

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:14.791
SHOULD UTILIZE THE PROVIDER

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:16.893
DIRECTORY SYSTEM.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.828
WHICH CURRENTLY IT IT --

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:20.096
CURRENTLY IT'S VALIDATION

00:53:20.163 --> 00:53:22.065
PROCESS FOR THOSE PROVIDER

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:24.467
DIRECTORIES IS LACKING.

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:28.605
DH CS WILL -- WILL APPROVE A AND

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:30.507
PLANTS PROVIDER DIRECTORY

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:30.807

WITH -- A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:35.378
ERRORS IN IT AND UTILIZING A LOW

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:36.880
CONFIDENCE RATE.

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:39.115
WE RECOMMENDED THAT IT INCREASE

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:40.951
THE CONFIDENCE INTERVAL.

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:43.420
MAINTAIN ITS -- MARGIN OF ERROR

00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:47.157
AND INCREASE THE ACCURACY -- SO

00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:48.892
THAT DH CS CAN.

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:50.894
ADDRESS ACCESS FOR THESE

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:51.795
FAMILIES.

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.096
IN A METHOD THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:54.631
THE ADDITION OF A SINGLE NEW

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:57.334
PROVIDER.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.802
WE'VE ALSO RECOMMENDED THE DH CS

00:53:58.868 --> 00:53:59.502
WOULD REQUIRE PLANS TO TAKE

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.338

CONDUCTED BUT THE OUR

00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:20.223
RECOMMENDATION IS FOR DHS TO

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.158
HOLD THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:23.793
ADDRESS WHAT IT'S FINDING IN

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:23.994
THOSE.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.295
ASSESSMENTS.

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:26.997
THAT OUR LAST RECOMMENDATION ON

00:54:27.063 --> 00:54:29.165
THE SUMMARIES FOR DH CS. TO

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:30.133
MONITOR AND IDENTIFY THE

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.935
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT PLANTS

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:33.670
ARE DOING AT THE PLAN LEVEL. TO

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:34.738
IDENTIFY THOSE THAT ARE MOST

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.973
SUCCESSFUL AND THEN TO SHARE THE

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.175
RESULTS OF THOSE -- OF THOSE

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:42.312
PROGRAMS WITH ALL THE PLANTS.

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.848
SO THAT CONCLUDES MY TEST ON

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:46.850
WE'RE OPEN TO QUESTIONS AT THIS

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:50.220
TIME.

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:52.422
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:53.423
APPRECIATE THE APPRECIATE THE

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.492
PRESENTATION AND APPRECIATE THE

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:57.594
WORK ON THE AUDIT -- SO I I DO

00:54:57.661 --> 00:54:59.262
HAVE SOME SOME KIND OF BASIC

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:02.932
QUESTIONS SO -- BIGGEST IN YOUR

00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:06.236
OPINION WAS YOU FEEL LIKE THE

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:07.570
ACS IS YOU KNOW.

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:08.571
LIVING UP TO THE STAND IT LIVING

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:11.041
UP TO THE ALTER OF ACCESS

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:14.044
STANDARDS AS THEY ARE OTHERS AS

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.513
THEIR PRESCRIBED.

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:18.415
WELL I I WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:19.049
ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS THE

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.116
CONCERN THAT WE HAD IN THAT WE

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:21.584
RAISED IN THE REPORT IS.

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:23.787
THERE THEIR FOCUS WAS PRIMARILY

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:25.555
ON WHETHER OR NOT A PARTICULAR

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:27.524
PLAN DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY MADE

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:30.427
EFFORTS TO FIND PROVIDERS.

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.528
BUT THEN WHEN THEY APPROVE THE

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:33.763
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD AS

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.498
WE SHOW IN THE REPORT SOME OF

00:55:35.565 --> 00:55:36.766
THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:38.168
STANDARDS ARE REQUIRING

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:39.836
BENEFICIARIES AS I SAID TO

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.471
TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES SO.

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:44.441
THERE NEEDS TO BE -- A DIFFERENT

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:48.445
FOCUS SO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN.

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.747
CONDUCTED EFFORTS ARE DID IS DUE

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:51.381
DILIGENCE IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:53.116
A PROVIDER WITHIN ITS OWN

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:54.350
NETWORK.

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.186
BUT THEN REALLY LOOK AT THE

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:57.320
REASONABLENESS OF THE

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:59.389
ALTERNATIVE THAT THAT PARTICULAR

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:00.957
PLAN IS SUGGESTING.

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.692
KEEPING IN MIND WHO THEIR THEY

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:05.061
BENEFICIARIES ARE AND THEN MAKE

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:06.429
A DETERMINATION NO THAT'S NOT

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:09.032
THAT'S NOT A REASONABLE STANDARD

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:10.834
AS AN ALTERNATIVE WE WE YOU KNOW

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.334
WE KNOW YOU DID YOU DUE

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:12.202
DILIGENCE.

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:13.036
BUT YOU'VE COME UP WITH AN

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:14.571
ALTERNATIVE THAT STILL IS NOT

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:16.940
REASONABLE FOR BENEFICIARIES IN

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:19.375
CALIFORNIA THEREFORE -- PART OF

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:20.643
IT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION TO

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.912
ALLOW OUT OF PLAN BUT ALSO WE

00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:24.347
DIDN'T REALLY SEE PLANS.

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:26.549
INFORMING BENEFICIARIES THAT YOU

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:28.918
KNOW IF THIS IS JUST TOO ARDUOUS

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:30.353
TO TAKE YOUR CHILD THREE HUNDRED

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.755
MILES FOR SERVICE THEN WE'RE

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:33.556
GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO GO TO WIN.

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:35.558
AN OUT OF PLAN PROVIDER SO -- IN

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:36.893
A NUT SHELL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.194
IS I THINK DEPARTMENT HEALTH

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:40.096
CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO DO MORE

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:41.531
WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATE ACCESS

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:43.299
STANDARDS AND NEEDS TO BE HAVE.

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:45.668
A MORE STRINGENT ANALYSIS OF

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:47.704
THOSE ALTERNATIVES THAT PLANS

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:49.305
ARE SUGGESTING.

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:50.406
SO YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE

00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:52.475
LIKE I BELIEVE SIXTY EIGHT

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:56.746
HUNDRED THAT WERE APPROVED.

00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:57.280
HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE FOR

00:56:57.347 --> 00:57:00.216
PRIMARY CARE?

00:57:00.283 --> 00:57:03.086
TEAMS OF THE HEAD.

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:03.686
I DON'T HAVE I DON'T HAVE THE

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:04.287
NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE BUT I

00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:05.522
KNOW THAT THE 70% OF THE TEN

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:06.156
THOUSAND THAT WERE APPROVED FOR

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:07.657
SPECIFIC -- TO PROVIDERS FOR

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:09.392
CHILDREN -- SO SOME OF THOSE

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:10.727
WERE PRIMARY CARE AND SOME OF

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.662
THOSE WERE SPECIALISTS I CAN GET

00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:14.097
YOU THOSE EXACT NUMBERS I GUESS

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.398
WHAT I'M I GUESS WHAT I'M

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:17.267
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT YOU KNOW

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.169
I I I KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:20.170
PRIMARY CARE COMMUNITY.

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:21.905
PROVIDERS IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.807
COMMUNITY OUT THERE.

00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:25.975
SO IF IF THERE'S REQUEST FOR

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:27.243
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS FOR

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.913
PEOPLE HAVE TO GO LONG DISTANCES.

00:57:29.979 --> 00:57:31.080
I KIND OF WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.949
OF THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THAT

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:34.284
THAT ISN'T THAT IS AN

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.752
UNACCEPTABLE BURDEN I BELIEVE.

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:38.855
AND SO YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:41.090
CASES YOU KNOW.

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.325
THE STATE YOU KNOW IF STATE LAW

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:42.759
PREVENT PER PERMITS

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:43.927
BENEFICIARIES TO GO OUT OF

00:57:43.993 --> 00:57:44.961
NETWORK YOU KNOW.

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:45.595
COULD SHOULD THAT BE HAPPENING

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:47.197
SO THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE TO

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:48.832
TRUCK TRAVEL IN IN SOME CASES

00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:50.266
MAYBE IS ONLY A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:52.936
MILES BUT UNDER FIFTY MILES IN

00:57:53.002 --> 00:57:53.670
MY DISTRICT.

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:56.539
AS AN ADVENTURE RIGHT -- AND AND

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:57.874
THAT'S AND I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH

00:57:57.941 --> 00:57:59.342
I THINK THAT'S AN ONEROUS BURDEN

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:00.476
ON ON PEOPLE.

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:03.813
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE --FOR

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.349
A QUALIFIED FOR THE SERVICES --

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:09.452
SO -- THERE SEEM TO BE -- QUITE

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.154
VARIATION IN THE NUMBER OF

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:13.256
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS BY

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:15.925
PLAN -- IT DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.594
THOUGHTS ON ON THAT YEAH WE

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.262
FOUND THAT THAT WHEN YOU TOOK

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.397
THE TOTAL POPULATION OF PRIMARY

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:23.233
CARE PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE.

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:24.467
AND AND YOU DIDN'T ISOLATE

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.469
DIDN'T HOLD PEOPLE SPECIFIC TO

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:28.638
ONE PLAN THAT THERE IS A GREATLY

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:30.807
INCREASED ACCESS SO ALLOWING

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.809
THIS OUT OF NETWORK ACCESS.

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:34.277
REALLY WILL MAKE A BIG

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:41.451
DIFFERENCE -- TO TO MEMBERS ALL

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:43.319
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:58:43.386 --> 00:58:44.587
BUT IT'S NOT.

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:46.055
BEING REALLY UTILIZED.

00:58:46.122 --> 00:58:46.723
THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:47.490
CONCERNS WE HAD IN THE REPORT

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:48.157
THAT THERE THAT IS AN OPTION BUT

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:48.791
IT'S NOT BEING SHARED WITH THE

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:50.093
BENEFICIARIES THEY AREN'T BEING

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:51.861
INFORMED OF ALL OF THEIR OPTIONS

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:53.463
WITH RESPECT.

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:54.797
TO GETTING ACCESS TO CARE FOR

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:56.733
THEIR CHILDREN AND THEN ALSO

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.501
DOCTOR WOULD WE WE HAD AS YOU

00:58:58.568 --> 00:58:59.869
KNOW WHAT TABLE IN THE REPORT

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:01.404
WHERE WE WERE LOOKING AT

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:03.306
UTILIZATION RATES AND SO THOSE

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:04.908
PARTICULAR PLANS THAT HAD VERY

00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:06.709
LOW UTILIZATION RATES FOR

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:07.644
CHILDREN.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.345
GETTING PREVENTIVE CARE ARE THE

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.113
ONES WHO ARE GETTING THE HIGH

00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:12.148
NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE ACCESS

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:13.950
STANDARDS APPROVED SO THEIR

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.485
UTILIZATION RATES ARE ALREADY

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:17.220
LOW AND NOW YOU'RE EXPECTING A

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:19.822
BENEFICIARY. TO TRAVEL YOU KNOW

00:59:19.889 --> 00:59:21.591
POTENTIALLY HUNDREDSOF MILES TO

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:23.826
GET ACCESS TO THAT CARE WHEN.

00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:26.129
THEY'RE THERE MAY VERY WELL BE A

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:27.563
PROVIDER WHO'S OUT OF NETWORK

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.365
RELATIVELY CLOSE FOR THAT

00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:30.800
BENEFICIARY.

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:32.135
WAS THERE ANY COMMON TO COULD

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:33.036
YOU DETECTIVES ARE A COMMON

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:36.239
DENOMINATOR IN THOSE REALLY LOW

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:38.574
PERFORMING [inaudible]

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:41.144
IN THE YEAH I'M SORRY IN THE LOW

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.645
PERFORMING PLANTS YEAH EXACTLY

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:43.246
IS THERE A COMMON DENOMINATOR

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:43.479
THERE.

00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:44.714
WE DID SEE THAT IT WAS MORE

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.449
COMMON -- IN THE EASTERN PARTS

00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:48.718
OF THE STATE AND IN RURAL PARTS

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:51.654
OF THE STATE -- EVERY EVERY PLAN

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:53.656
IN EVERY GEOGRAPHY ESPECIALLY

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:55.658
CALIFORNIA'S DIFFERENT -- BUT WE

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:58.161
DID SEE SOME COMMONALITIES IS

00:59:58.227 --> 00:59:58.795
ESPECIALLY THAT HAD TO DO WITH

00:59:58.861 --> 00:59:59.696
THEM.

00:59:59.762 --> 01:00:04.334
URBAN VERSUS RURAL AND YOU KNOW

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.635
WESTERN VERSUS EASTERN.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.437
AND THE NORTHERN.

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.706
A PART OF THE STATE ALSO SHOWED

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:12.942
SOME -- SOME STRUGGLING TO MEET

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:16.079
THE ACCESS STANDARDS

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:16.379
[inaudible]

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:21.250
SO -- AS YOU STARTED DOING YOUR

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:24.120
AUDIT DID DID DCS SEEM A

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.888
SURPRISED BY YOUR WEB BY WHAT

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:27.523
YOUR QUESTION IN OF YOUR

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.691
FINDINGS OR WAS IT WAS.

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.593
NOT AT ALL I THINK DHS IS VERY

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.528
AWARE -- BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:36.165
THE ACCESS ISSUE IN THE STATE --

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:37.467
DATE BUT AS THE STATE AUDITOR

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:41.371
SAID THERE IS A LOT MORE THAT

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:42.805
THEY COULD BE DOING.

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:43.439
SO THEY'RE AWARE OF IT BUT THERE

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:44.173
WASN'T THEY'RE NOT REALLY

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.274
PUSHING THE PLANS ARE NOT

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.710
PUSHING FOR AND ANYTHING TO

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:51.047
HAPPEN IT'S BUT THAT'S THEIR

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:52.148
AWARE OF IT AND THERE'S THERE'S

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:54.250
MORE THAT THEY COULD DO.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.518
THAT'S CORRECT YEAH.

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.020
RIGHT AND AND MISTER WHAT I

01:00:57.086 --> 01:00:58.221
THINK WHAT WE WITH THE SCENE IN

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.756
THE REPORT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:00.990
HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAVE REALLY

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.425
DELEGATED A LOT OF THEIR

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.561
RESPONSIBILITY. TO THE PLANTS TO

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.163
MAKE SURE THE PROVIDERS AND THE

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.198
BENEFICIARIES ARE INFORMED OF

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.267
EXPECTATIONS.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.202
AND ANTI NOT HAPPEN TITLE MAN

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:14.670
BUT WHAT BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:16.939
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE AND WHAT OUR

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.241
CONCLUSION IS IS THAT BERMAN

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:19.842
HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.611
STEP UP NOT ONLY GUIDANCE.

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.346
BUT OVERSIGHT THEY HAVE DEFERRED

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.281
AND DELEGATED TO MUCH TO THE

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.650
PLANS AND PROVIDERS THEMSELVES.

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:28.785
SO THAT THEY DEFERRED AND

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.154
DELEGATED SO IS THERE SO THERE

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.322
REALLY ISN'T ONE SET DELEGATION

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:34.490
AND REFERRALS HAPPEN THERE IS IT

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:37.527
ISN'T.

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:38.394
ISN'T THE OVERSIGHT THAT.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:39.595
THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING UP TO MAKE

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:40.897
SURE THAT THOSE THINGS THAT THE

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:42.565
ALLIGATOR ARE HAPPENING.

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:43.866
SO ACT LIKE SO CONSEQUENTLY

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:44.901
BASED ON THE FINDINGS THEY'RE

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:46.669
NOT HAPPENING.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.838
THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S WHAT WE

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.507
FOUND SO -- SO RIGHT BEFORE THE

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:53.609
AUDIT WAS RELEASED -- DESIST DAC

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.011

POINT WE'LL HAVE MORE TO SAY ON

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.970
THAT.

THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.710
QUESTIONS AS WELL MAYBE I'LL

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.078
JUST FOLLOW UP ON WHAT -- DOCTOR

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:30.580
WOULD WAS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:33.449
OF THE AMOUNT OF MILES THAT.

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.517
FAMILIES HAVE TO TRAVEL RIGHT

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.384
AND YOU SAID IN SOME CASES OVER

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:36.385
A HUNDRED MILES.

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.721
YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS -- PRETTY

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:40.990
EGREGIOUS SO WAS IT IN YOUR

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.358
FINDINGS WAS A LACK OF

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.593
INFORMATION TO THE FAMILIES

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:44.794
LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.262
ACTUALLY GO TO OUT OF NETWORK

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.430
PROVIDERS.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.398
SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:50.466
TRAVELING THIS GREAT DISTANCES.

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.768
BUT IN IN SOM CASES IT'S NOT

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:53.970
INFORMING OF FOLKS THAT THEY

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.972
HAVE ACCESS TO OUT OF NETWORK

01:02:56.038 --> 01:03:00.910
PROVIDERS -- UP MORE OFTEN --

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:02.245
IT'S NOT INFORMING FAMILIES THAT

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.012
THEY ACTUALLY.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:06.115
CAN GET HELP GETTING TO THOSE

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:09.352
LONG DISTANCES -- BUT IT'S IT'S

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.953
MORE THAN JUST THE DISTANCE IN

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.622
THE TRAVEL TIME IT'S IT'S THE

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:15.625
TIME OFF WORK AND IT'S THE NO

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:18.895
IT'S GETTING THESE FAMILIES. TO

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:19.929
TO HAVE A LITTLE.

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:22.598
FAITH IN THE SYSTEM -- THAT THAT

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.267
THIS THAT.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.234
ACCESS IS A REAL THING FOR THEM.

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.470
HI SO IT HAS TO DO WITH

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:28.104
INFORMING BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DO

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:28.704
WITH.

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:31.040
IMPROVING THAT CONDITION THAT

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.442
HAS LED TO THESE ON REASONABLE

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:34.944
STANDARDS.

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:36.879
SO WE SAY ACCESS TO HELP WITH

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.447
THE HELP SUCH AS ONE THERE'S

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.650
TRANSPORTATION HELP THE DH YESES

01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:44.820
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE.

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:48.591
MR SALAS SIMILAR TO THE THE

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.660
DISCUSSION WE HAD EARLIER AGAIN

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:52.061
THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE THE

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:53.329
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:54.397
IS REALLY.

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:56.065
DELEGATING OR OR YOU KNOW

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:57.900
EXPECTING THE PLANS TO INFORM

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.569
PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE PROVIDERS

01:03:59.635 --> 01:04:01.103
ARE INFORMING BENEFICIARIES.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.104
AND DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.340
SERVICES IS NOT MAKING SURE THAT

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:05.675
PLANS ARE DOING THAT SO THAT.

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:07.810
BENEFICIARIES ARE EVEN AWARE

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.680
THAT THEY CAN POTENTIALLY TAKE

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:12.014
THEIR CHILD TO AN OUT OF NETWORK

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.549
PROVIDER TO GET THOSE SERVICES

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.384
RATHER THAN TRYING TO EITHER

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:17.386
ARRANGE FOR TRANSPORTATION TO

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:19.689
TAKE THEIR CHILD HUNDRED FIFTY

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:20.323
TWO HUNDRED MILES.

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.225
SO AGAIN IT'S IT'S THE

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.459
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.128
NEEDS TO HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:28.164
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.600
INFORMING BENEFICIARIES OF THEIR

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.435
RIGHTS IN THE ELIGIBILITY FOR

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:33.769
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES AND

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:37.640
WHO CAN OR SHOULD BE PROVIDING

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:38.007
THOSE SERVICES.

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:39.842
GOT IT.

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:40.443
NO I UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:41.444
THAT LEADS TO MY NEXT QUESTION

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:42.778
WHICH YOU KNOW IN YOUR HANDOUTS

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:46.349
PAGE -- FOR AND THEN THE ON IT

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:51.220
FIGURE TWO ON PAGE.

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:52.054
FIFTEEN THE SAME BECAUSE THE CHS

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.956
HAS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THE

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:56.325
BOXES YOU VIOLATED IS A JUST

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:56.926
THREE TO SIX BUT IT'S REALLY

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:57.860
HIGH.

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:01.397
BUT I LOOK AT YOU KNOW FROM ZERO

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.866

FIRST YEAR AND ROUGHLY 25% FOR

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:10.339
TWO YEAR OLDS.

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:12.174
DID YOU FIND A REASON WHY THE

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.543
HUGE DROP OFF IS IT BECAUSE OF

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.946
THE LACK OF PERFORMANCE

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:17.713
STANDARDS.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.148
IT IT'S PARTLY DUE TO THE LACK

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:20.650
OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS IN THAT

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.618
SOMETHING THAT DH CS CAN DO

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.687

REASONS FOR THAT THAT MAY BE.

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:37.500
BEYOND DHS CSS CONTROL -- SUCH

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:40.269

BUDGET -- THE NEXT LARGEST

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:14.390
MEDICAID PROGRAM IN THE NATION

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:16.192
IS NEW YORK AND WEIRD MORE THAN

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:17.726
TWICE AS BIG AS NEW YORK SO JUST

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:20.129
FOR PURPOSES OF COMPARISON.

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:21.597
WE AS THE AUDITOR NOTED HAVE

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:22.865
ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF MILLION

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.334
CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAM TODAY --

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.136
OUR CASELOAD CURRENTLY STANDS AT

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.671
ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION --

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:30.940
INDIVIDUALS ALL TOLD WE COVER

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.107
HALF THE BIRTH IN THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA WE COVER TWO THIRDS

OF THE NURSING HOME STAYS -- AND

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:39.315
SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.317
SIGNIFICANT COMPLEXITY OF WHAT

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.152
WE DO AND HOW INDIVIDUALS GET

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:49.391

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:50.326
OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO DELIVER

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:51.560
WHAT IS AN ENTITLED SERVICE TO

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.761
ENTITLED BENEFICIARIES -- WE WE

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:53.529
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:54.997
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SENIORS AND

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.332
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AS

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:57.800
WELL AS I NOTED WITH CALIFORNIA

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:58.934
CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

01:08:59.001 --> 01:08:59.935
WE HAVE CHILDREN THAT HAVE

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:02.171
BECOME -- CCS ELIGIBLE UPON

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.472
THEIR BIRTH AND WILL REMAIN WITH

US FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:07.042
LIVES AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:09.211
CONTINUING TO IMPROVE AND ALWAYS

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:11.146
STRIVE TO DO BETTER WHEN WE

01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:13.415
DELIVER CARE TO OUR VULNERABLE

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:15.518
POPULATIONS -- SOME OF THE

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.520
THINGS I THINK THAT WE ARE --

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:19.822
BOTH PROUD OF THAT CONTINUE TO

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:22.258
PROVIDE SERVICES TO KIDS TODAY --

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:23.726
INCLUDE AND IMPROVE DENTAL

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:26.228
PROGRAM I KNOW THAT I STOOD

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:28.631
BEFORE DOCTOR WOULD AND OTHERS I

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.032
WHEN I FIRST STARTED AT THE

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.700
DEPARTMENT BACK IN.

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:32.334
TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAVE HAD AN

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:33.569
AUDIT DONE BY THE STATE AUDITOR

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.337
AROUND THE UTILIZATION OF

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.705
SERVICES BY CHILDREN AND OUR

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:37.840
DENTAL PROGRAM.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.475
AND WE SAID WE WILL DO BETTER

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.876
AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.378
THAT AND I THINK THAT FOUR YEARS

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:44.179
LATER -- WE CAN SAY THAT WE HAVE

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:45.714
MADE PROGRESS I WOULD SAY THAT

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:47.516
WE'RE NOT DONE BUT CERTAINLY WE

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.518
HAVE INCREASED OUR UTILIZATION

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:51.954
AND THAT HAS BEEN AS A RESULT OF

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:53.556
THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE HAD

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.624
WITH BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:56.892
THE LEGISLATURE AT THE

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.661
STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PROVIDERS --

01:09:58.727 --> 01:09:59.862
SO THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:01.096
THAT IS CONTINUING TO BOTH OF

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:02.665
ALL OF AND IMPROVE BUT CERTAINLY

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:04.667
SOMETHING THAT -- WE HAVE SEEN

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.402
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BEING MADE

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:08.270
IN TERMS OF DELIVERY OF SERVICES

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.973
TO CHILDREN -- A LITTLE KNOWN --

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.908
PROGRAM THAT WE STARTED A COUPLE

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.209
OF YEARS AGO IS KNOWN AS WHOLE

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:16.211
CHILD MODEL -- THESE ARE

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:17.913
CHILDREN THAT -- RESIDE IN

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.481
COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.984
COUNTY SERVICE AREAS -- THEY ARE

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.319
CHILDREN THAT STRADDLE THE CCS

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:24.920
PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE MEDICAL

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.589
PROGRAM AND THEY WERE HAVING

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.624
THEIR SERVICES -- DISJOINTED

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:29.992
BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT DELIVERY

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:32.261
SYSTEMS AND SO WE HAVE AN ROLE

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:33.996
THESE CHILDREN IN VERY SPECIFIC

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.598
COUNTIES -- INTO WHAT IS KNOWN

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:36.999
AS THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL SUCH

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.801
THAT ALL OF THEIR SERVICES ARE

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:39.768
BEING DELIVERED BY THE FACT

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:40.803
COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM.

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:42.538
AND CAL OPTIMA THE ORANGE COUNTY

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.807
MODEL WILL BE THE LAST COUNTY --

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:48.377
THAT WE BRING LIVE STARTING ON

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:50.913
JULY -- ONE SOME OF THE ITEMS --

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.914
WE'RE STATE THAT OPERATES LARGE

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:53.082
MEDICAID WAIVERS WITH THE

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:54.617
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SO WHEN I

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:55.784
TALK ABOUT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.186
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THEY

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:58.721
CONSTITUTE ABOUT SIXTY BILLION

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:00.990
DOLLARS OF OUR HUNDRED BILLION

01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:03.659
DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET -- WE HAVE

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.227
A SIGNIFICANT WAIVERS WITH THE

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:06.228
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.230
DEMONSTRATE CERTAIN THINGS IN

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.432
THE STATE AND ONE OF THOSE IS --

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:11.767
WHOLE PERSON CARE WHICH I HINK

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:13.135
NOT NECESSARILY FOCUS ON

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.503
CHILDREN BUT CERTAINLY SOME OF

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.738
THE INNOVATIVE.

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:17.239
TYPES OF DELIVERY CHANGES THAT

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:18.774
WE AS A STATE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:20.476
COLLECTIVELY WITH PROVIDERS AND

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.645
COUNTIES AND ADVOCACY GROUPS TO

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:25.748
TRY AND BRING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:26.949
LIFE ALTERING.

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:28.417
OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:29.251
ARE STRUGGLING WITH EITHER

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:30.753
MENTAL ILLNESS OR HOMELESSNESS

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:33.088
OR CHRONIC DISEASE -- THE DENTAL

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:35.290
TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE -- IS

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:37.726
ALSO A SIGNIFICANT -- INVESTMENT

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.028
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:40.629
HELPED US MAKE AND IN TERMS OF

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:42.231

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:45.067
DTI IS FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.635
CHILDREN AND MEDICAL CHILDREN IN

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:48.771
THE DENTAL PROGRAM -- WE HAVE

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.339
WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE DENTAL

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:52.675
ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS PROVIDERS

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.977
SCHOOLS MOBILE CLINICS TO

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.478
INCREASE AND ENHANCE THE

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:57.813
SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.981
TO CHILDREN IN TERMS OF

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.317
PREVENTIVE CARE I THINK WE HAVE --

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:03.118
HEARD QUITE WELL FRIEND THE

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.586
STATE ORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:06.989
DOCTOR KUMAR THAT IF YOU DO NOT --

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.557
PROVIDE THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:10.659
TO THE CHILDREN AT THE BEGINNING --

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:13.762
THEIR ADULT DENTAL DISEASE -- IS

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:14.897
IS M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; OR DRIVE DRAMATIC AND&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:16.198
MORE COSTLY AND SO WE HAVE

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.734
CERTAINLY -- BEEN EXCITED TO

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:19.735
EMBRACE AND SEE THE RESULTS OF

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:23.872
THAT DENTAL TRANSFORMATION

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:24.473
INITIATIVE THROUGH OUR FEDERAL

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.974
WAIVER -- LASTLY I KNOW THAT THE

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:26.608
AUDITOR SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:28.777
TIME TOUCHING ON THE PROPOSITION

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.312
FIFTY SIX FUNDS -- I WILL

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:33.248
CERTAINLY PUT A PLUG IN TO SAY --

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:35.217
THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN -- BOTH

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.519
INCREASINGLY HELPFUL AND

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:39.254
REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL I BELIEVE

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:40.856
IN THE THREE YEARS THAT WE HAVE

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:43.058
BEEN I USING THEM -- OBVIOUSLY

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.126
IN COOPERATION WITH THE

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.394
LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE ANNUAL

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.563
BUDGET PROCESS LAST YEAR WE

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.398
ADDED THE PREVENTIVE -- SERVICE

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.433

SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR THAT --

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.476
SERVICE WHETHER THEY'RE IN FEE

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:01.143
FOR SERVICE OR IN MANAGED CARE

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.578
AND I THINK THAT THOSE FUNDS

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.146
HAVE CERTAINLY AND WHAT WE HOPE

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.014

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:06.388
A LOT OF REASONS FOR THIS BUT WE

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:10.525

WAS WONDERING ARE THERE

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:50.692
ADDITIONAL WAYS TO TO PROVIDE

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:51.793
THAT INFORMATION TO FAMILIES

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:53.027

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:54.328
AT THE RATES AND WHAT THE HONOR

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:55.163
TO POINT IT OUT.

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:56.831
YOU KNOW YOU SEE THIS THIS LACK

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:58.766
OF UTILIZATION AND I'M JUST

01:28:58.833 --> 01:28:59.867

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:12.647
RIGHT.

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:13.948
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:17.785
THAT -- WHAT WE HAVE FOUND -- AT

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:19.287

HISTORY WITH THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:24.125
YOU CANNOT RELY ON A SINGLE --

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.594
INTERVENTION TO AFFECT A CHANGE

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:28.763
IN OUR PROGRAM IT IS SIMPLY --

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.765
TOO BIG -- THERE ARE TOO MANY

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:33.868
DIFFERENT -- PLACES IN WHICH

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:35.103
POPULATIONS ARE DIFFERENT AND

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:40.975
NEEDED TARGETED INTERVENTION I

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:42.643
THINK THAT WE HAVE A S. A SERIES

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:43.644
OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WOULD

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:44.512
LIKE TO HAVE WITH OUR

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:46.013
STAKEHOLDERS -- THROUGH AND WE

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:46.581

GROUP AS WELL AS A BROADER

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:49.784
STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:51.119

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:52.553
LEGISLATURE IN THE CONVERSATIONS

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.722
THAT WE HAVE -- IN A POLICY

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:55.923
BASIS.

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.725
WE LIKE TO GO AND SAY WE'RE

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.227
STRUGGLING -- WHAT'S HEALTH

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:01.129
DISPARITIES FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:03.264
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DATA AND

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:06.167
WHILE I'M HISPANIC CHILDREN --

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.735
HAVE A HIGHER VACCINATION RATE

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:09.437
WE'D REALLY LIKE TO UNDERSTAND

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:11.906
WHY ANOTHER ON POPULATION IS NOT

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:13.841
SEEN THAT SAME KIND OF

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.143
ACCEPTANCE AND ADOPTION OF THE

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:16.277
VACCINE.

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:19.180
AND SO -- SOME OF THE WORK

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.615
AROUNDS -- TARGETING

01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:21.949
INTERVENTIONS REALLY COMES FROM

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:23.951
FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.953
CLOSER TO THE GROUND IF YOU WILL

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.289
IN TERMS OF PROVIDERS COMMUNITY

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:29.757
BASED ORGANIZATIONS LEGAL

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:32.260
ADVOCATES -- TRADE ASSOCIATIONS

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:33.361
AND CERTAINLY THE HEALTH PLANS

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:34.662
BECAUSE THEY ARE DELIVERY

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:36.631
SERVICES IN THAT REGIONAL AREA

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:39.100
AND SO -- SOME OF THE WORK

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:41.369
AROUNDS INCREASING UTILIZATION

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:43.571
WILL COME AS A RESULT OF YOU

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:44.138
KNOW DOING THE TARGETED OUT

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:45.106
REACH.

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.041
MAKING THE PLANS -- MORE

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:49.310
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FOLLOW UP

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:51.212
AND FEEDBACK ON TO THERE MEMBERS

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:52.213
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR MEMBERS

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.614
ARE ACCESSING SERVICES THERE'S

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:56.484
CERTAINLY A CONVERSATION AND AND

01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:57.652
LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S THAT

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:58.786
NEED TO TAKE PLACE WITH THE

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.388
PROVIDERS THEMSELVES.

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:03.524
I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THE

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:04.091
DOCTOR WOULD.

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.227
BE IN A PROVIDER CAN CERTAINLY --

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.495
APPRECIATE AS WELL AS FROM WHAT

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:09.230
WE HEAR ANECDOTALLY IS WHEN YOU

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:10.198
HAVE.

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:12.667
A FULL PRACTICE -- AND YOU HAVE

01:31:12.733 --> 01:31:14.068
A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:15.670
WITH A PATIENT YOU MAY JUST BE

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:16.904
TREATING THE PATIENT FOR WHAT

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:18.272
THAT COMPLAIN AS TODAY AND YOU

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:20.908
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THE TIME.

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.443
TO KIND OF LOOK AT THE FULL --

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:23.744
ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT THEY

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.146
SHOULD BE GETTING BUT THEY MAY

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:27.582
NOT BE -- USING AND SO I THINK

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:28.549
SOME OF THE VALUE BASED

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:30.518
PURCHASED SCENE -- INITIATIVES

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:33.321
THAT WERE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:34.355
IS REALLY GETTING AT THE

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:36.324
PROVIDER LEVEL IN THE PROVIDER'S

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:39.093
OFFICE TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.528
LOOK AT THAT -- CHILD IN A MORE

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:42.496
COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO SAY YOU

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:43.030
MIGHT BE HERE FOR AN EAR

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:44.732
INFECTION -- BECAUSE THAT YOUR

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.267
CHIEF COMPLAINT TODAY BUT I'M

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.935
ALSO NOTICING THAT YOU'RE ABOUT

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.604
READY TO START SCHOOL -- HAVE

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.739
YOU RECEIVED YOUR VACCINES OR

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:53.207
YOU KNOW HAVE YOU EVER YOU KNOW

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:57.144
RECEIVED A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:58.746
SCREEN OR YOU KNOW LET'S TALK

01:31:58.813 --> 01:31:59.814
ABOUT YOUR DENTAL YOUR LASTED TO

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:00.214
LOOK SAM AND SO.

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:00.815
THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.016
INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:04.051
COMMITTED TO TO INCREASE

01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:06.220
UTILIZATION BUT I DON'T BELIEVE

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:08.322
THAT THERE'S ONE THING THAT WILL

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:10.124
BE THE SILVER BULLET TO HELP. TO

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:11.459
HELP DRIVE THOSE UTILIZATION

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:12.460
RATES IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A

01:32:12.526 --> 01:32:14.729
BROAD SPECTRUM OF THINGS.

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:16.330
AND IN ADDITION YOU KNOW I THINK

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:17.265
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:18.299
HAVE PRIMARY FOR THE OR THE

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:19.400
PHYSICIAN OR WHOEVER THEY'RE

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:20.835
GOING TO GO SEE.

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:21.602
YOU KNOW ASK FOR THOSE

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:22.770
ADDITIONAL SERVICES I THINK

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:26.173
THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO DO IT --

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.408
POLITICOS POINTED OUT AND

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.277
THOUGHT IT ALSO WAS A THE

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:32.747
PERFORMANCE METRICS.

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:34.348
RIGHT WHEN I THINK THAT WAS.

01:32:34.415 --> 01:32:36.250
SO THE THINGS THAT WE MEASURE --

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:38.152
ARE ARE OKAY AND THE THINGS THAT

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:39.453
WE ARE NOT MEASURE EIGHTEEN ARE

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.389
NOT SO GREAT AND SO I THINK THAT

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:44.592
THAT -- WAS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:45.660
ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE GOING TO

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:47.995
BE ADDING ALL OF THE CHILD AND

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.864
ADULT COURSE THAT MEASURES --

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:51.232
THAT IS AN ACCELERATION OF WHAT

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.935
A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT IS AND SO

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.036
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WILL HAVE

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:56.671
THOSE AND WE WILL BE MEASURING

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:59.173
FOR ALL OF THOSE MEASURES.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.574
YOU WILL CERTAINLY -- AND THIS

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:02.510
IS OUR HOPE -- YOU WILL SEE THAT

01:33:02.576 --> 01:33:03.844
UTILIZATION INCREASE A BECAUSE

01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:05.046
WE'RE GOING TO BE HOLDING THE

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.614
PLANS ACCOUNTABLE AND MEASURING

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:07.014
IT.

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:09.150
BUT IT ALSO -- COULD BE AND I

01:33:09.216 --> 01:33:10.685
KNOW THAT -- YOU WOULD ASK THIS

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:12.954
OF THE PREVIOUS PANEL IT MAY

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.822
ALSO BE A DATA CHALLENGE AND

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:16.190
THAT IF YOU HAVE A ONE YEAR OLD

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:17.725
AND THEY'RE IN THE DOCTOR MORE

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:18.592
OFTEN.

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.928
IT IT COULD ALSO BE A DATA ISSUE

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:21.862
FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT THE

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.531
PHYSICIAN IS JUST BUILDING A

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:24.932
EXAM CODE.

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:26.767
AND NOT A WELL CHILD CODE AND SO

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:28.469
I THINK THAT IS ALSO SOME OF THE

01:33:28.536 --> 01:33:29.603
WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING AS

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:30.972
A DEPARTMENT WHICH IS HOW DO WE

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:32.206
IMPROVE.

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:34.141
ENCOUNTER DATA SO ENCOUNTER DATA

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:35.943
FLOWS FROM THE PHYSICIAN TO THE

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.079
PLAN TO THE STATE AND SO THAT IS

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:39.347
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:41.215
BEEN DASH FOURTEEN AND PLAN TO

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:43.417
MAKE AVAILABLE -- PUBLICLY IS

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:44.618
THE ENCOUNTER DATA THAT THE

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:46.654
PLANTS GET FROM THE PROVIDERS

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:48.189
AND I THINK THAT WILL ALSO HAVE.

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:50.224
SOME IMPACT NOT A SIGNIFICANT

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.258
BUT A BOWL HAVE SOME

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:52.760
DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ACTUALLY

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:55.229
CHANGE SOME OF THE DATA IN THOSE

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:56.697

YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE

01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:03.064

LEGISLATURE.

01:35:03.964 --> 01:35:05.666
IN OBVIOUSLY THREE TO SIX YEAR

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.301
OLDS SEEM LIKE THINGS ARE GREAT

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:09.437
BECAUSE THERE'S A PART FOR THE

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:11.072
PERFORMANCE METRICS ARE THERE.

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:11.939

OTHER AGE GROUPS AND YOU SEE THE

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:14.608
LACK OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:15.910

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:16.844
YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:18.579

FOR FOR TO THAT ALSO -- ONE OF

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:25.986
THE ITS EXIT MENTIONED

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:26.821
ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL AREAS TO

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.600
WHICH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS YOU

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:41.168
OUTLINED WHERE THEY MIGHT NOT BE

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.470
ACCESSIBLE THERE BUT ARE WE

01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:44.238
LOOKING AT DOING THINGS LIKE

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:45.906
TELEMEDICINE.

TO PROVIDE THOSE ARE MAYBE SOME

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:48.476
OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:51.979
MIGHT BE A LOT CLOSER SURE SO --

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:55.316
A COUPLE THINGS SO TELEMEDICINE --

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:56.817
BUT WE THINK IT'S CERTAINLY.

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:58.853
BOTH HELPFUL AND AND A RURAL AND

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:00.588
IN AN URBAN AREA -- ESPECIALLY

01:36:00.654 --> 01:36:03.023
AS IT PERTAINS TO SPECIALTY CARE

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:06.760
IT HAS -- BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED --

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:10.498
WITH OUR FQHCS APPAN THE HI

01:36:10.564 --> 01:36:12.399
NORTHERN AREAS I KNOW THAT --

01:36:12.466 --> 01:36:14.335
SHASTA HAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:16.837
TELEMEDICINE -- PROGRAM THAT

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:18.572
THEY USE WITH UC DAVIS IN TERMS

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:19.773
TO TELL US LIKE HIGH ENTRY SO

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.342
PLANS ARE ABLE TO USE

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:24.145
TELEMEDICINE AND TELE CONSULS --

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:25.946
IN SOME CASES TO HELP MEET SOME

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:28.816
OF THEIR NETWORK REQUIREMENTS --

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:30.317
I THINK THAT.

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.786
THE LOAN REPAYMENT OF A

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:36.023
APPLICATIONS THE PHYSICIANS FOR

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:37.758
A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IS DOING%

01:36:37.825 --> 01:36:40.060
THE INITIAL KIND OF REVIEW OF

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:41.228
THE APPLICANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:42.530
THEY'RE ELIGIBLE RIGHT THEY HAVE

01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:43.898
TO BE WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:46.433
RESIDENCY -- OR HAVE JUST

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.401
GRADUATED FROM TO AMEND MEDICAL

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:49.003
OR DENTAL SCHOOL WITHIN THE LAST

01:36:49.069 --> 01:36:50.371
FIVE YEARS THEY'RE DOING THAT

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:53.541
KIND OF INITIAL CUT AND THEN WE

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:54.275
DOWN.

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:56.210
AND SAY YOU KNOW WHO ARE THESE

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.745
DOCTORS -- WHERE DO THEY

01:36:57.811 --> 01:37:00.481
PRACTICE -- LET'S TRY TO BALANCE --

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:02.583
CENTRAL VALLEY NEEDS WITH HI

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:04.585
NORTHERN AREA WITH SPECIALTY

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:05.719
TYPE I MEAN IT'S A REALLY

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:08.055
EXCITING PROCESS FOR US I THINK

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:12.860
WE ARE.

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:15.229
REALLY -- CONVINCED THAT BY

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:16.764
TAKING THE DEBT -- CALCULATION

01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:17.698
OUT OF A PROVIDERS -- MIND WHEN

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:18.732
THEY GRADUATE THAT THEY DON'T IF

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:20.167
THEY DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:20.734
HOW MUCH DEBT THEY HAVE TO

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:22.703
REPAIR THEM CHANGE THE NATURE OF

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:23.971
THE PROFESSIONAL.

01:37:24.038 --> 01:37:25.372
PLACE IN WHICH THEY PRACTICE AND

01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:27.942

MEDICAL PROGRAM LONGER THAN FIVE

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:33.881
YEARS -- SO I THINK THERE'S A

01:37:33.948 --> 01:37:35.583
LOT TO BE SAID FOR THE NORTHERN

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:37.117
AREA AS WELL CENTRAL VALLEY

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:38.852
WHICH WE HAVE HEARD CONSISTENTLY

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:41.689
STRUGGLE -- I COME FROM I GREW

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:43.057

PATEL CALIFORNIA POPULATION.

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:47.628
SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THE

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:48.762
ELEVATION IS HIGHER THAN THE

01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:51.365
POPULATION -- THERE ARE PLACES

01:37:51.432 --> 01:37:53.000
IN OUR STATE AND I KNOW THAT --

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:54.735
THE AUDITOR CERTAINLY USED --

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:57.137
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE IN WHICH

01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:58.939
CERTAIN SPECIALTY -- TYPES

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:00.474
ESPECIALLY PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:04.311

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:05.679
MILES AWAY -- THERE ARE ONLY

01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:07.681
PROBABLY A HANDFUL OF PEDIATRIC

01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:09.216
NEURO OPHTHALMOLOGIST IN THE

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.584
ENTIRE STATE.

01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:12.253

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:21.395
OPHTHALMOLOGIST THAT'S JUST KIND

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:24.164
OF THE WAY IT IS I THINK THAT --

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:25.266
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:28.235
PROVIDERS CLOSER BY THAT CAN

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:30.137
SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE CHILD'S

01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:32.006

THIS BY THE CHILDREN'S SPECIALTY

01:38:35.976 --> 01:38:37.811
CARE COALITION ALL THE TIME IS

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:40.180
PEDIATRIC -- SPECIALISTS ARE

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:41.382
VERY DIFFERENT THAN ADULT

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:42.983
SPECIALTY SO A ADULT

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:44.585

SPECIALISTS I THINK WE HAVE SEEN

01:38:54.628 --> 01:38:55.963
EVEN IN THE INITIAL DATA THAT

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:57.231
THE PLANS HAVE BEEN DOING THAT

01:38:57.298 --> 01:38:58.332
AND SO WE EXPECT THOSE

01:38:58.399 --> 01:39:00.267
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS REQUEST TO BE

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:01.635

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:28.255
THE TELEMEDICINE POLICY THAT WE

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:30.257
RELEASED IN THE FALL IT WAS

01:40:30.324 --> 01:40:32.126
ACROSS MANAGE CARE FEE FOR

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:34.461
SERVICE -- OUR MENTAL HEALTH --

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:37.498
DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WELL AS ON

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.400
FAMILY PLANNING AND ANY PLACE IN

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.268
WHICH WE HAVE PROVIDERS THAT ARE

01:40:41.335 --> 01:40:42.770
BILLING SERVICES ACROSS THE

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:44.972
DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS -- WE

01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:46.440
WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT VERY

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:48.475
CLEAR THAT A CONSULTATION THAT

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:49.977
WOULD TAKE PLACE -- IN A

01:40:50.043 --> 01:40:51.979
PROVIDER'S OFFICE THAT COULD BE

01:40:52.045 --> 01:40:53.046
DONE VIA TELEMEDICINE THERE'S

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:54.415
SOMETHING THERE SOME SERVICES

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:55.282
THAT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE BE TELL

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:56.950
US AND OBVIOUSLY BUT TO THE

01:40:57.017 --> 01:40:58.252
EXTENT THAT IT COULD BE DONE.

01:40:58.318 --> 01:40:59.553
THAT THEY COULD BILL FOR IT AND

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.054
HOW TO DO THAT AND SO WE

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:02.856
PROVIDED PRETTY EXPLICIT --

01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:05.092
INSTRUCTIONS THROUGH ALL OF THE

01:41:05.159 --> 01:41:06.760
DIFFERENT ON THE PROVIDER MANUAL --

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:08.429
OUR PROVIDER BULLETINS -- AND

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:09.763
THINGS LIKE THAT SO I'M HAPPY TO

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:11.198
PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:12.399
TECHNICAL AS TO SEE HOW WE SAID

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:14.001
IT COULD BE DONE BUT IT WAS OUR

01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:15.636
INTENTION TO MAKE SURE.

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:18.305
THAT IF IT'S APPROPRIATE -- THEN

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:19.173
THE CONSULTATION SHOULD TAKE

01:41:19.239 --> 01:41:23.243
PLACE VIA TELEMEDICINE AND YOU

01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.844
WOULD BILL IT AS YOU NORMALLY

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:26.146
WOULD.

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:28.682
WELL I WOULD JUST SAY I GUESS IT

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:29.917
THAT'S DOESN'T APPEAR.

01:41:29.983 --> 01:41:32.219
FROM THE PLANE'S PERSPECTIVE

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.620
THAT IS WORKING THAT WELL -- AND

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:35.088
THE COULD WE IN OTHER WORDS YOU

01:41:35.155 --> 01:41:36.590
COULD BE DOING MORE WITH THAT I

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:37.724
THINK THAT'S THE IMPLICATION

01:41:37.791 --> 01:41:42.563
THAT'S GREAT FEEDBACK -- SO.

01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:43.864
BEEN LISTENING TO THE OUTSIDE OF

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:44.665
THE AUDITOR THEY SAID THAT.

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:45.933
THE DA SAYS WASN'T PARTICULARLY

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:47.568
SURPRISED BY.

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:48.168
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:50.437
WERE POINTING OUT ARE ASKING --

01:41:50.504 --> 01:41:51.738
I GUESS IT WOULD HAVE AND A HALF

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:53.073
MILLION PEOPLE IN MANAGED CARE

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.475
AND YOU KNOW TWO AND A HALF

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:56.210
MILLION KIDS THAT ARE NOT

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:58.745
GETTING CARE ON A REGULAR BASIS.

01:41:58.812 --> 01:42:01.915
HOW LONG THE JUNO?

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:03.283
UP ABOUT THIS.

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:04.218
AND AND WHAT IT WHAT IT WHAT'S

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:05.486
BEEN GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:07.588
I KNOW YOU KNOW THERE'S A NEW

01:42:07.654 --> 01:42:10.023
DASHBOARD THIS BEEN GOING ON BUT

01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:11.692
THIS IS THIS ISN'T SOMETHING

01:42:11.758 --> 01:42:13.026
THAT JUST APPEARED OVERNIGHT.

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:15.496
HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW OR OR MAKE

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:16.697
ME THAT'S NOT A FAIR QUESTION

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:18.098
HAVE YOU BEEN ACTIVELY WORK HAS

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:19.166
THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY BEEN

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:20.868
REALLY WORKING ON THIS?

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:23.136
BECAUSE I WILL SAY THAT FROM MY

01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:25.105
PERSPECTIVE WHEN I SAW THE AUDIT

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:28.242
I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED -- IT'S

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:29.676
PRETTY HARD TO MISS PLACE TWO

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:31.578
AND A HALF MILLION KIDS.

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:34.815
SURE I THINK -- A COUPLE THINGS.

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:37.184
THE ADDITION OF THE PREVENTIVE

01:42:37.251 --> 01:42:40.187
SERVICE CODES -- IN LAST YEAR'S

01:42:40.254 --> 01:42:41.889
BUDGET WHEN WE ADDED THOSE TO

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:43.423
THE PROP.

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.125
FIFTY SIX CERTAINLY REFLECTED --

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:46.226
BOTH OUR INTEREST IN

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:49.296
UNDERSTANDING THAT -- PROVIDERS

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:51.932
IF INCENTIVIZE TO BILL.

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.967
AN EXAM CODE A STANDARD EXAM

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:56.136
CODE WOULD BY PASS THE

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:58.005
APPROPRIATE CODE THAT THEY

01:42:58.071 --> 01:43:00.007
PROBABLY SHOULD BE -- BILLING I

01:43:00.073 --> 01:43:01.408
THINK WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:03.176
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:05.846
HAS BEEN -- NOT NECESSARILY

01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:07.981
IGNORING CHILDREN BUT WE HAVE

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:09.416
BEEN BUILDING THE BASE

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:11.318
INFRASTRUCTURE -- TO EVEN HAVE

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:12.619
THE DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:14.321
HAPPENING AT A MORE AND MORE

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:18.125
GRANULAR LEVEL -- OUR PLANS HAVE --

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.093
MEDICAL GROUPS THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.896
YOU KNOW A PLAN WILL CONTRACT

01:43:22.963 --> 01:43:24.298
WITH.

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:25.465
A CERTAIN IPA OR CERTAIN MEDICAL

01:43:25.532 --> 01:43:27.801
GROUP AND SO THE DATA QUALITY

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:30.404
THE MORE THAT IT GETS DELEGATED --

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:32.039
THE HARDER IT IS FOR THAT DAY TO

01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:34.007
COME BACK IN A BETTER WAY AND SO

01:43:34.074 --> 01:43:35.075
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:36.610
PLANTS AROUND THE PROVIDER FILES

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:37.311
THAT WE GET.

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:38.512
AROUND THE ENCOUNTER DATA

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.514
SUBMISSIONS -- SOME OF THOSE

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:44.051
THINGS -- HAVE TAKEN AND A WHILE

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:46.053
TO BOTH -- IMPLEMENT AND THEN

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:47.988
ONCE YOU HAVE THE DATA COMING IN

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:48.555
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT SAYING

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:50.324
ALRIGHT WHAT A MY SCENE HERE IN

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:52.059
TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT SUMMARY.

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:55.062
I THINK THAT -- IT WAS CERTAINLY

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:57.464
NOT OUR INTENTION TO TAKE OUR

01:43:57.531 --> 01:44:00.233
EYE OFF THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.936
THE PROGRAM BUT I THINK THAT --

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:04.838
AS I SAID THERE HAVE BEEN --

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:07.341
SIGNIFICANT OTHER INITIATIVES

01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:09.209
UNDER WAY IN OUR DEPARTMENT --

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:10.677
THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WORK MANAGE

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:13.380
CARE ALSO ARE WORKING ON

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:14.314
ACCORDING TO CARE INITIATIVE

01:44:14.381 --> 01:44:17.084
WHICH IS OUR DUAL -- INITIATIVE

01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:18.852
TO BLEND CARE BETWEEN MEDICARE

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:20.520
AND MEDICAID SERVICES FOR

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:21.955
INDIVIDUALS THAT SIT IN BOTH

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.924
PROGRAMS HE WAS JUST HAD A LOT

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:25.459
OF DIFFERENT COMPETING DEMANDS

01:44:25.525 --> 01:44:26.793
AND SO I THINK THIS AUDIT WAS A

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:29.363
REALLY GOOD -- REMINDER FOR US

01:44:29.429 --> 01:44:31.665
TO REFOCUS -- ON SOME OF THE

01:44:31.732 --> 01:44:34.067
BASIC -- UNDERPINNINGS OF WHAT

01:44:34.134 --> 01:44:35.602
THE PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:37.004
DOING IN TERMS OF PREVENTIVE

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:38.672
SCREENINGS AND THAT'S NOT JUST

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:40.340
CHILDREN RIGHT -- WE'RE ADDING

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:41.908
NOT ONLY THE CHILD METRICS BUT

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:44.945
ALSO THE ADULT MEASURES AS WELL

01:44:45.012 --> 01:44:46.847
TO THE EXTERNAL KIND ABILITY SET --

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:48.815
WE'RE RECOGNIZING THAT WE SERVE

01:44:48.882 --> 01:44:50.550
A LOT OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

01:44:50.617 --> 01:44:52.386
NOT JUST CHILDREN THIS AUDIT

01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:54.321
CERTAINLY PUT A VERY STRONG

01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:55.355
EMPHASIS AND HIGHLIGHT ON

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:56.923
CHILDREN IT IS CONSISTENT WITH

01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:58.325
THE GOVERNOR'S -- INTEREST IN

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:00.327
DOING ON A LOT OF WORK TO

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:01.561
IMPROVE SERVICES IN THIS AREA

01:45:01.628 --> 01:45:03.096
BUT WE ARE ALSO A PROGRAM THAT

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:04.197
SERVES.

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:04.965
SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH

01:45:05.032 --> 01:45:06.133
DISABILITY AND SINGLE CHILDLESS

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:08.568
ADULTS AND SO -- A LOT OF THE

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:09.903
AUDIT IS GOING TO HAVE

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.638
RAMIFICATIONS FOR US MORE

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:12.806
BROADLY IN TERMS OF HOW WE HOLD

01:45:12.873 --> 01:45:14.174
THE PLANTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR A

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:20.313
VARIETY OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:23.350
NOT JUST RELATING TO KIDS -- I

01:45:23.417 --> 01:45:26.853
KNOW THAT -- CORRECT I GO TO A

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.355
VARIETY OF THINGS HERE BUT I WE

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:29.423
ALSO ALSO HAVE ANOTHER PANEL.

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:31.725
TO OTHER STATES SEEM TO BE DOING.

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:32.859
THEY HAVE INCENTIVES SAY THAT

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:33.960
BUT YOU KNOW STATES LIKE IOWA --

01:45:34.027 --> 01:45:34.628
HAWAII LOUISIANA.

01:45:34.695 --> 01:45:36.263
ARE WE GOING TO IMPLEMENT SOME

01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:37.964
SORT OF INCENTIVES OR ARE WE

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:39.666
GONNA DO SOMETHING PROACTIVE. TO

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.702
GET OR OR OR IS THIS GOING TO

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:45.505
CONTINUE TO DELEGATE TO THE

01:45:45.572 --> 01:45:46.306
PLANS TO DO THAT TO ME.

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:46.840
I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:49.776
AUDITOR WAS THAT THE PLANS.

01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:53.080
DID WHAT THEY WERE BEING.

01:45:53.146 --> 01:45:54.481
YOU KNOW CHECKING ON THERE BUT

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:55.849
THAT WAS AND THAT WASN'T THE

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:57.651
FULL PICTURE SO WE'RE GONNA

01:45:57.718 --> 01:45:58.518
CHECK ON MORE THINGS THAT'S

01:45:58.585 --> 01:46:01.088
GREAT BUT BUT IS THERE ANY AYE

01:46:01.154 --> 01:46:02.923
IN ANY AND LOOK AT IT OTHER WAYS

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:03.657
TO BE.

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:10.764
MORE CREATIVE AND I JUST.

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:12.999
YES SIR SORT OF A SORT OF A LACK

01:46:13.066 --> 01:46:13.834
FOR FOR UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:15.001
SO FAR BEHIND THESE OTHER STATES%

01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:18.305
SO I THINK SOME OF THE INCENTIVE --

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:20.640
AND INNOVATION IS COMING THROUGH --

01:46:20.707 --> 01:46:22.476
VALUE BASED PURCHASING -- WE

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:24.144
HAVE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE AND

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:25.812
SO ON YOU KNOW AS THE GOVERNOR'S

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:27.114
PROPOSED IN THE LEGISLATRE

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:29.149
STILL NEEDS TO AGREE WITH HIS

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.751
PROPOSAL -- AROUND THAT

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:32.686
INITIATIVE -- THAT IS IN SOME

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:34.654
CASES OUR INTEREST IN

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:36.289
INCENTIVIZING CHANGES AT THE

01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:38.625
LEVEL IN WHICH THE PATIENT CARE

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:42.395
IS DELIVERED -- WE HAVE BEEN.

01:46:42.462 --> 01:46:43.830
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PLANS

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:46.333
AROUND DIFFERENT WAYS TO CHANGE

01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:49.035
THE RATES IN TERMS OF SURE SAY

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:51.772
BEANS OR ALLOWING THEM TO KEEP A

01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:55.542
PORTION.

01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:57.277
QUALITY OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT I

01:46:57.344 --> 01:46:59.346
THINK SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT

01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:00.547
WE ARE SEEKING TO MAKE IN THE

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:03.416
PROGRAM CONSISTENT WITH THE

01:47:03.483 --> 01:47:05.452
RENEWAL OF OUR WAIVER -- OUR

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:06.887
ENTIRE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM IS

01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:08.288
IN THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:10.123
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:12.325
BELIEVE -- THAT WILL COME AS A

01:47:12.392 --> 01:47:13.560
PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WE'RE

01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:14.628
CHANGING THE RATE YEAR WE'RE

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:16.163
DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:17.130
TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:18.799
ACROSS THE DIFFERENT.

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.700
MEDICAL MANAGE CARE MODELS -- WE

01:47:20.767 --> 01:47:22.169
HAVE A PLAN PROCUREMENT THAT'S

01:47:22.235 --> 01:47:23.804
COMING UP STARTING NEXT YEAR

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:25.939
THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES IN WHICH

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:27.140
WE ARE.

01:47:27.207 --> 01:47:29.276
KIND OF MARCELINE -- AN

01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:30.410
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A

01:47:30.477 --> 01:47:30.977
CONVERSATION WITH THE PLANS

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:32.946
ABOUT PLAN INCENTIVES VERSUS

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:34.214
PROVIDERS CENTERS AND THOSE ARE

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:37.450
VERY DIFFERENT AND FOR NOW WE'VE

01:47:37.517 --> 01:47:39.186
CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON THE PROVIDER

01:47:39.252 --> 01:47:41.254
INCENTIVES -- AND THE PLAN

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:42.355
INCENTIVES ARE A CONVERSATION

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:43.790
THAT WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN AS A

01:47:43.857 --> 01:47:45.492
RESULT OF THE WAIVER RENEWAL AND

01:47:45.559 --> 01:47:49.396
THE CHANGES THAT WERE MAKING IN

01:47:49.462 --> 01:47:51.097
MANAGED CARE MORE BROADLY.

01:47:51.164 --> 01:47:52.032
SO WHAT WHAT WHAT'S REASONABLE

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:52.599
FOR US TO EXPECT IN THE NEXT

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:55.468
YEAR. TWO YEARS.

01:47:55.535 --> 01:47:58.171
I MEAN WHAT WE GONNA SEE.

01:47:58.238 --> 01:47:59.139
WHAT METRICS ARE YOU GONNA PUT

01:47:59.206 --> 01:48:00.407
IN PLACE SO WE CAN MONITOR HOW

01:48:00.473 --> 01:48:01.508
WELL YOUR YOU GUYS ARE DOING AS

01:48:01.575 --> 01:48:03.310
A DEPARTMENT -- I WOULD HAVE TO

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:05.846
TELL YOU AFTER THIS WHEN I GO

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:07.013
BACK AND CHECK WITH THE TEAM IN

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.316
TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY WE WOULD BE

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:12.319
ABLE TO PROVIDE -- DATA AND

01:48:12.385 --> 01:48:14.654
INITIAL FEEDBACK ON WHAT THIS

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:15.488
MEASUREMENT YEARS GOING TO LOOK

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:16.223
LIKE.

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:17.791
RIGHT SO THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:18.825
MAKING TO THE PLAN

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:21.328
ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALL OF THE

01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:22.963
ADDITION OF THE CHILD AND ADULT

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:24.030
COURSE THAT MEASURES.

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:25.432
ON IS IN THIS CURRENT MEASURE

01:48:25.498 --> 01:48:27.634
YEAR I'M NOT SURE ONCE THAT DATA

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:29.202
IS SUBMITTED TO US HOW LONG IT

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:32.105
TAKES FOR US TO KIND OF

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.707
AGGREGATED IN A RAW FASHION TO

01:48:33.773 --> 01:48:34.908
KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:36.109
NOT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT

01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:37.577
CHANGES OR NOT.

01:48:37.644 --> 01:48:39.679
I THINK I'M WEIRD LIKE I SAID

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:41.815
I'M AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE A

01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:43.783
EVOLVING AND CONTINUING REGULAR

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:45.252
CONVERSATION WITH YOU AROUND

01:48:45.318 --> 01:48:45.752
WHAT WERE SEEN AROUND

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:46.987
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:48.455
REQUEST WE THINK THAT THAT'S

01:48:48.521 --> 01:48:49.556
GOING TO CHANGE.

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:50.690
IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MANNER

01:48:50.757 --> 01:48:53.960
THIS YEAR EVEN FROM LAST YEAR --

01:48:54.027 --> 01:48:55.495
SO I THINK WHAT YOU WILL HEAR

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:56.796
FROM US IS AN OPENNESS AND

01:48:56.863 --> 01:48:58.732
WILLINGNESS TO HAVE AN ONGOING

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:00.300
DIALOGUE IN TERMS OF THIS IS THE

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:02.435
DATA THAT WE SEE -- THESE ARE

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:04.004
THE MEASURES THAT WERE --

01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:05.505
STRUGGLING WITH IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:49:05.572 --> 01:49:07.007
THE PLANS ARE STRUGGLING WITH --

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:08.308
SUMMER BETTER THAN OTHERS RIGHT

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:09.776
WE HAVE A DASHBOARD OUR PLANS

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:11.511
FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW -- WE

01:49:11.578 --> 01:49:12.979
CHOOSE DIFFERENT QUALITY

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:15.015
MEASURES EVERY QUARTER AND THOSE

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:17.884
DASHBOARDS REFLECT PLANS -- AND

01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:19.586
IN EACH AREA AND SO YOU CAN SEE

01:49:19.653 --> 01:49:20.720
THE PLANS THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY

01:49:20.787 --> 01:49:22.322
RANKED AT THE TOP YOU CAN SEE

01:49:22.389 --> 01:49:23.723
PLANS THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY NOT

01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:25.926
AT THE TOP -- AND I THINK THAT

01:49:25.992 --> 01:49:27.360
IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD --

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:28.962
BOTH WELCOME A DIALOGUE WITH AS

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:30.263
WELL AS WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE

01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:32.032
THE DATA TO YOU IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:33.566
WE'RE SEEN AND WHAT.

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:35.435
THE PLAN PERFORMANCES AND THEN --

01:49:35.502 --> 01:49:36.736
LIKE I SAID THERE'S A LOT OF

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:38.405
INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE KIND

01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:39.606
OF UNDER WAY TO KIND OF IT.

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:42.208
CHANGE SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES.

01:49:42.275 --> 01:49:43.510
BUT CERTAINLY IN AND

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:45.679
UNDERSTANDING AND OPENNESS TO

01:49:45.745 --> 01:49:49.783
HAVE AND CONTINUE DATA WITH --

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:51.751
DATA SHARING WITH YOU.

01:49:51.818 --> 01:49:52.786
WHEN I LOOK AND I LOOK FOR TO

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:53.353
THAT ACTUALLY FOR TWO MORE

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:53.853
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:54.688
TELEMEDICINE PART OF THIS I

01:49:54.754 --> 01:49:55.155
THINK ESPECIALLY IN?

01:49:55.221 --> 01:49:56.923
REMOTE RURAL AREAS I THINK

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:58.058
THAT'S A REALLY VALUABLE TOOL

01:49:58.124 --> 01:49:59.426
BUT MY IMPRESSION FROM THE PLANS

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:00.260
IS THAT.

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:03.096
THAT THAT THERE IS A DISCONNECT

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:04.164
THE TERROR THAT THAT.

01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:05.765
THE DEPARTMENT IS SLOW AND

01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:09.436
MOVING ON ON ON IMPLEMENTATION --

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:11.237
THAT'S MAYBE I'M PARAPHRASING SO

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:12.973
THAT BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE

01:50:13.039 --> 01:50:15.175
IT'S IF THIS IS NOT A WELL OILED

01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:16.876
MACHINE HERE ON THAT PART NOT

01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:17.944
EVEN CLOSE.

01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:19.946
IT APPEARS I WILL I HAVE I HAVE

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:22.082
NOTED THAT IT WILL GO BACK.

01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:23.450
AND AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:25.685
TALK -- BECAUSE WE CAN PULL.

01:50:25.752 --> 01:50:27.153
DATA FROM OUR DATA WAREHOUSE NOW

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.155
AND TELL YOU HOW MANY ENCOUNTERS

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:29.589
HAVE BEEN BUILDING A

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:32.158
TELEMEDICINE -- BUT SAM MODIFIER

01:50:32.225 --> 01:50:33.660
SO WE'RE HAPPY TO EVEN JUST TELL

01:50:33.727 --> 01:50:35.395
YOU WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND TELL

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:36.796
YOU WHAT WE HAD LAST YEAR AND

01:50:36.863 --> 01:50:38.465
SEE WHETHER THAT HAS CHANGED

01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:39.933
INCREASED REMAINED FLAT.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.735
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IF WE NEED TO

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:44.104
RE ITERATE THAT CHANGE IN POLICY

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:46.406
WITH THE PLANS -- AND SEE IF

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:48.475
THAT CHANGES THE LEVEL OF BOTH

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:49.909
ACCEPTANCE ADOPTION AN

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:51.711
INTERVENTION -- THAT SOMETHING

01:50:51.778 --> 01:50:52.846
THAT WERE WHAT CAN YOU DO

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:54.080
BECAUSE WE THINK IT MAKES --

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:55.749
SINCE BILLS FOR THE PROVIDER AS

01:50:55.815 --> 01:50:57.150
WELL AS FOR THE BENEFICIARY IN

01:50:57.217 --> 01:50:58.184
WHICH CASES.

01:50:58.251 --> 01:51:00.286
OFTENTIMES IT'S MOST BENEFICIAL

01:51:00.353 --> 01:51:02.288
FOR THE BENEFICIARY.

01:51:02.355 --> 01:51:02.889
DOES THE DEPARTMENT EVER MEANS

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:04.491
ARE EVER IS YOU HAVE GUIDELINES

01:51:04.557 --> 01:51:05.291
AND AND THINGS THAT YOU FOLLOW

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:07.894
IS THERE EVER FLEXIBILITY TO

01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:08.294
REFLECT.

01:51:08.361 --> 01:51:10.764
THE THE UNUSUAL OR OR

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.565
CHALLENGING NATURE OF CERTAIN

01:51:12.632 --> 01:51:14.434
GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OR THESE ARE

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:19.472
THE GUIDELINES THIS IS WHAT WE

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:20.774
HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN.

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:21.908
BUT WAIT A SECOND.

01:51:21.975 --> 01:51:23.009
I'M IN SISKIYOU COUNTY AND YOU

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:24.644
KNOW.

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:25.879
IT'S ACCESSING CARE IS REALLY

01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:26.746
REALLY DIFFICULT.

01:51:26.813 --> 01:51:29.015
ARE WE ARE WE BOUND BY THIS IS

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.550
THIS IS THIS IS THE GUIDELINE

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:31.751
AND THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:35.221
THERE IS NO ABILITY -- TO LOOK

01:51:35.288 --> 01:51:37.223
AT AN ALTERNATIVE HERE WITH

01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:38.792
RESPECT THE FACT THAT.

01:51:38.858 --> 01:51:39.692
WE DON'T HAVE SOME ALTERNATIVE

01:51:39.759 --> 01:51:40.860
THIS PERSON'S GONNA HAVE TO

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.695
TRAVEL FIVE OR SIX HOURS AND WE

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:43.997
MAY BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH

01:51:44.064 --> 01:51:45.999
TELEPHONE TELEMEDICINE OR ARE WE

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:47.767
KIND OF BOUND BY THESE

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:49.169
GUIDELINES I THINK YOU KNOW

01:51:49.235 --> 01:51:52.272
OBVIOUSLY AS A DEPARTMENT -- WE

01:51:52.338 --> 01:51:56.409
WERE WE TRY REALLY HARD TO BOTH --

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:57.610
WE TRY TO BALANCE FLEXIBILITY

01:51:57.677 --> 01:52:00.380
WITH -- RESPONSIVENESS AND

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:03.483
ACCOUNTABILITY -- AND SO AND I

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:05.218
KNOW THAT THE AUDITOR SAID THIS

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:06.252
IN HER PREVIOUS COMMENTS AND

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:08.488
THAT -- SHE FELT THAT WE

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:10.056
DELEGATED TO MUCH TO THE PLANS --

01:52:10.123 --> 01:52:12.358
IN SOME CASES WHEN WE DELEGATE

01:52:12.425 --> 01:52:14.060
TO THE PLANS WE ARE OFTEN SAYING

01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:15.829
WE IN SACRAMENTO DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:17.664
IS HAPPENING AND SISKIYOU COUNTY

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:19.165
AND SO IF THE PLAN IS SAYING.

01:52:19.232 --> 01:52:21.067
HEY I'VE GOT BENEFICIARIES THAT

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:24.070
IT'S CHEAPER EASIER AND FASTER

01:52:24.137 --> 01:52:25.905
FOR ME TO HAVE THEM GO TO NEVADA --

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:27.307
AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEND

01:52:27.373 --> 01:52:29.142
THEM TO NEVADA INSTEAD OF TO

01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:31.544
SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DO

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:32.912
DEFERRED OF THE PLANS BECAUSE

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:34.147
THEY ARE ON THE GROUND AND

01:52:34.214 --> 01:52:36.749
UNDERSTANDS TRAVEL PATTERNS AND

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:37.884
PROVIDER ARRANGEMENTS IN

01:52:37.951 --> 01:52:40.420
CONTRACTING -- THAT BEING SAID

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:42.856
SO WE WE VALUE FLEXIBILITY WHEN

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.224
WE CAN PROVIDE IT WHEN IT IS

01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:45.959
BENEFICIAL TO THE BENEFICIARY

01:52:46.025 --> 01:52:47.293
AND WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.462
IF THE FLEXIBILITY MEANS THAT IT

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:50.797
IS NOT ACCRUING TO THE

01:52:50.864 --> 01:52:52.732
BENEFICIARIES.

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:54.300
BENEFIT THEN NOW -- YOU KNOW WE

01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:55.568
DON'T WANT TO BE FLEXIBLE IN

01:52:55.635 --> 01:52:57.504
THAT AREA AND SO FOR

01:52:57.570 --> 01:53:03.042
TELEMEDICINE PURPOSES -- WE LOOK

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:05.178
MAKE THINGS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:07.347
THEM AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT

01:53:07.413 --> 01:53:08.882
HELPS THE PLAN ALSO MADE ITS

01:53:08.948 --> 01:53:11.751
NETWORK -- STANDARDS THAT AS A

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:13.419
AS ADDITIONAL BENEFIT BUT THAT'S

01:53:13.486 --> 01:53:14.387
NOT THE REASON THAT WE'RE DOING

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:15.755
IT WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE WE

01:53:15.822 --> 01:53:17.290
WANT THE BENEFICIARY TO BE ABLE.

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:18.691
TO RECEIVE IT IN THE MOST

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:20.793
CONVENIENT WAY POSSIBLE -- IF

01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:22.462
TELEMEDICINE'S THE CASE GREAT IF

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:23.930
IT'S NOT THEN IT'S SOMETHING

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:26.299
ELSE -- THE CHANGE IN THE

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:27.934
TRANSPORTATION BENEFIT A COUPLE

01:53:28.001 --> 01:53:29.836
OF YEARS AGO WAS DONE FOR A

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:32.238
REASON -- THE PLANS NOW HAVE

01:53:32.305 --> 01:53:33.106
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:35.708
TRANSPORTATION BOTH MEDICAL.

01:53:35.775 --> 01:53:36.743
NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL

01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:38.545
TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS NON

01:53:38.611 --> 01:53:43.316
MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION THE TWO

01:53:43.383 --> 01:53:45.018
WERE DIFFERENT -- FOR ALL OF

01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:46.286
THEIR MEMBERSREGARDLESS OF THE

01:53:46.352 --> 01:53:46.886
SERVICE THAT THEY'RE GETTING

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:47.554
WHETHER OR NOT THAT SERVICES THE

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:48.621
PLANT'S RESPONSIBILITY OR NOT.

01:53:48.688 --> 01:53:49.889
OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:51.257
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:52.692
TRANSPORTATION TO DENTAL

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:54.394
SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE OR TO

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.762
SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:56.596
SERVICES.

01:53:56.663 --> 01:53:58.298
AND SO THAT WAS REALLY OUR

01:53:58.364 --> 01:54:00.934
EFFORT AN INTENTION TO MAKE IT

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.402
EASIER FOR THE BENEFICIARY TO

01:54:02.468 --> 01:54:03.570
GET TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY

01:54:03.636 --> 01:54:04.904
NEED AND IF TRANSPORTATION WAS

01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:06.839
THE PROBLEM THAT WE WERE PUTTING

01:54:06.906 --> 01:54:08.474
THE PLANS FULLY IN CHARGE OF

01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:09.976
PAYING FOR THAT TRANSPORTATION

01:54:10.043 --> 01:54:11.377
AND THAT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A

01:54:11.444 --> 01:54:11.778
BENEFIT.

01:54:11.844 --> 01:54:13.479
THAT WE HAVE HEARD -- AND WE

01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:15.682
WILL SEE CERTAINLY IN OUR RATE --

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:17.650
TEMPLATE THAT THAT HAS BEEN USED

01:54:17.717 --> 01:54:19.219
IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WAY AND

01:54:19.285 --> 01:54:20.587
THAT WAS THE INTENTION IS WE

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:22.121
WANT TRANSPORTATION USED IF IT

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:23.656
IF THAT'S THE CHANGE THAT NEEDS

01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:25.091
TO HAPPEN.

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:27.227
SO I THINK -- THERE'S A LIKE I

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:28.061
SAID EACH.

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:30.263
EACH -- CHALLENGE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:31.731
IN OUR PROGRAM REQUIRES

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:33.533
INTERVENTIONS AT DIFFERENT

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.068
LEVELS AT DIFFERENT TIMES FROM

01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:36.236
DIFFERENT ENTITIES IN DIFFERENT

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:39.205
PLACES BUT WE TRY REALLY HARD TO

01:54:39.272 --> 01:54:41.441
BE REASONABLE AND A PLANE COMES

01:54:41.507 --> 01:54:42.542
WORKING FOR ME.

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:45.845
AND I NEED YOU TO MAKE THIS

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:47.213
MODIFICATION.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.448
TO THE CONTRACTOR THE BENEFIT --

01:54:48.514 --> 01:54:49.882
WE TRY REALLY HARD TO DO THAT IF

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:51.684
IT MAKES SENSE -- WE HAVE PLANS

01:54:51.751 --> 01:54:53.886
THAT HAVE.

01:54:53.953 --> 01:54:56.656
UNIQUE FEATURES -- YOU KNOW I

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:58.324
LIKE TO USE -- HEALTH PLAN OF

01:54:58.391 --> 01:55:00.760
SAN MATTEO WHICH IS A GREAT PLAN --

01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:03.329
THEY PAY FOR ANTI PSYCHOTICS

01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:04.397
EVEN THOUGH NO OTHER PLAN IN THE

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:05.965
STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

01:55:06.032 --> 01:55:07.200
PROVISION OF ANTI PSYCHOTICS

01:55:07.267 --> 01:55:08.701
IT'S A CARVED OUT BENEFIT TO FEE

01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:09.969
FOR SERVICE.

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:11.638
DON'T ASK ME WHY HEALTH PLAN SO

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:13.539
MATTEO PAYS FOR ANTI PSYCHOTICS

01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:15.241
AND DON'T ASK ME WHY WE AGREED

01:55:15.308 --> 01:55:16.776
TO ALLOW THEM TO PAY FOR ANTI

01:55:16.843 --> 01:55:17.744
PSYCHOTICS BUT THEY DO.

01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:18.711
AND THERE'S PROBABLY SOME

01:55:18.778 --> 01:55:22.849
HISTORY AS TO WHY THAT OCCURRED --

01:55:22.915 --> 01:55:24.751
SO WE DO THERE'S TONS OF THOSE

01:55:24.817 --> 01:55:26.319
LITTLE EXAMPLES BURIED IN OUR

01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:27.820
PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE MADE

01:55:27.887 --> 01:55:29.155
ALLOWANCES AND CHANGES AND

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:31.157
FLEXIBILITY -- SOME OF THAT MAY

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:32.959
NEED TO CHANGE JUST GIVEN THE

01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:35.328
BROADER GOALS THAT WE HAVE BUT

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:36.929
WE DO LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES

01:55:36.996 --> 01:55:38.965
AS TRYING TO DO RIGHT BY THE

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:42.035
BENEFICIARY WHEN SOMEONE COMES

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:45.104
AND ASKS FOR US TO DO THAT.

01:55:45.171 --> 01:55:46.105
AND FINALLY I APOLOGIZE I KNOW A

01:55:46.172 --> 01:55:47.273
LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S JUST

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.075
MY NATURE -- ARE THERE TIMES I

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:50.209
MEAN YOU YOU SAID I WAS THE

01:55:50.276 --> 01:55:52.211
PLANS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:54.714
PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION -- TO

01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:56.916
CERTAIN KINDS OF APPOINTMENTS --

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:58.084
AT THE BELIEVE I'VE HEARD ENOUGH

01:55:58.151 --> 01:55:59.552
I'M AND I'M NOT I DON'T BELIEVE

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:00.620
IN MAKING THIS UP BUT THERE ARE

01:56:00.687 --> 01:56:02.422
TIMES WHEN THE PLAN PAYS MORE IN

01:56:02.488 --> 01:56:03.523
TRANSPORTATION.

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:05.124
IN THE CONSULTATION WOULD HAVE

01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:07.894
COSTED -- AND SO.

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.265
HOW OFTEN DOES THE PLAN HAVE THE

01:56:12.332 --> 01:56:14.867
ABILITY TO THEN -- CONTRACT WITH

01:56:14.934 --> 01:56:15.935
SOMEONE LOCAL SO THAT THAT THAT

01:56:16.002 --> 01:56:17.470
IF ISSUE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

01:56:17.537 --> 01:56:18.938
AND WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A

01:56:19.005 --> 01:56:20.873
MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF DOING

01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:23.643
THINGS SOMETIMES -- SO DID IT

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:25.912
DEPENDS RIGHT SO IT DEPENDS ON

01:56:25.978 --> 01:56:27.413
THE CONSULTATION -- IF A

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.916
BENEFICIARY NEEDS TO BE SEEN BY

01:56:29.982 --> 01:56:31.617
A CERTAIN SPECIALTY PROVIDER AND

01:56:31.684 --> 01:56:34.821
THAT SPECIALTY PROVIDER IS.

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:36.522
A HUNDRED MILES AWAY THEN THE

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:38.658
PLAN HAS TO PAY FOR THAT BENEFIT

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:40.360
SURE TO GET THERE IF THEY

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:41.027
OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE.

01:56:41.094 --> 01:56:42.528
TRANSPORTATION TO DO THAT EVEN

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:44.163
IF IT COSTS MORE TRANSPORTATION

01:56:44.230 --> 01:56:46.566
BECAUSE THE PLAN IS RESPONSIBLE

01:56:46.632 --> 01:56:47.300
TO MAKE SURE.

01:56:47.367 --> 01:56:48.634
THAT THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:50.470
SERVICE -- IS DONE BY THE

01:56:50.536 --> 01:56:52.739
APPROPRIATE PROVIDER IF SOMEONE

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:54.374
NEEDS TO SEE A CARDIOLOGISTS.

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.509
THEN THE PLAN HAS TO PAY TO GET

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:58.411
THEM TO SEE THAT CARDIOLOGISTS --

01:56:58.478 --> 01:56:59.645
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THEM

01:56:59.712 --> 01:57:01.381
TO SEE A G. P. -- WHEN A

01:57:01.447 --> 01:57:03.082
CARDIOLOGISTS IS THE INDIVIDUAL

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.983
THAT NEEDS TO BE SEEN THAT

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.318
PATIENT AND SO IT REALLY KIND OF

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:07.186
DEPENDS ON A PATIENT BY PATIENT

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:09.989
BASIS BUT -- THE PLAN IS

01:57:10.056 --> 01:57:11.691
RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTATION --

01:57:11.758 --> 01:57:13.359
BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A RATE

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:16.062
PROCESS AND WHICH PLANS ACCOUNT

01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:16.996
FOR THE COSTS.

01:57:17.063 --> 01:57:18.297
AND THE AND PROVIDING THOSE

01:57:18.364 --> 01:57:19.766
VARIOUS SERVICES AND THEN OUR

01:57:19.832 --> 01:57:23.136
ACTUARIES INCORPORATE THAT INTO

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:24.270
THE RATE GOING FORWARD.

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:25.571
SO THERE'S A THERE'S AN

01:57:25.638 --> 01:57:28.641
ACCOUNTING FOR THAT COST -- IN

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.810
THEIR RATE TEMPLATES.

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:31.944
SO THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS REQUIRED

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:35.782
TO EAT THE LOS THAT'S CORRECT.

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:39.452
OKAY WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF

01:57:39.519 --> 01:57:40.052
YOUR AS WELL AND I APOLOGIZE I

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:41.854
THOUGHT THAT WAS -- THAT THAT

01:57:41.921 --> 01:57:42.755
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WHEN THE

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:44.857
BENEFICIARY IS TRAVELING TO A

01:57:44.924 --> 01:57:46.526
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:47.727
THEY'RE HAVING TO DO THAT.

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:48.761
THEY HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:50.296
THAT THERE ARE PRIMARY CARE

01:57:50.363 --> 01:57:52.231
PROVIDERS ALONG THE WAY -- BUT

01:57:52.298 --> 01:57:54.167
THAT DOESN'T FEEL VERY HELPFUL

01:57:54.233 --> 01:57:56.969
TO THE BENEFICIARY -- SO WAS THE

01:57:57.036 --> 01:57:59.138
PLAN THAT JUST READ THE IS IS IT

01:57:59.205 --> 01:57:59.739
UP TO THEM TO SAY WE'RE JUST

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:00.973
GONNA TRY TO WE WERE NOT GOING

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.408
TO CONTRACT WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE

01:58:02.475 --> 01:58:04.243
GOING TO SEND THAT PERSON WITH A

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:06.279
CONTRACT -- WE WE CAN'T CONTRACT

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:08.214
BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET THE RATES

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:10.416
THAT WILL BRING THAT PROVIDER ON

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:12.018
YEAH AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO

01:58:12.084 --> 01:58:15.621
THE SPECIFICS OF THE GEOGRAPHY --

01:58:15.688 --> 01:58:17.156
YOU KNOW.

01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:17.957
WERE ALWAYS CLEAR TO SAY --

01:58:18.024 --> 01:58:19.258
PLANTS HAVE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:22.428
ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES

01:58:22.495 --> 01:58:25.131
I DO THE APPROPRIATE PROVIDER --

01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:26.632
AND THAT'S BOTH PRIMARY AND

01:58:26.699 --> 01:58:28.935
SPECIALTY CARE -- THEY DON'T

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:31.204
HAVE TO GUARANTEE ACCESS TO A

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:32.872
PARTICULAR PROVIDER SO IF A

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:35.675
BENEFICIARY SAID I REALLY LIKE --

01:58:35.741 --> 01:58:38.110
DOCTOR BOB HE'S FANTASTIC AND I

01:58:38.177 --> 01:58:39.846
WANT TO SEE DOCTOR BOB AND IF

01:58:39.912 --> 01:58:41.614
THE PLAN DOESN'T HAVE A CONTRACT

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:42.982
WITH DOCTOR BOB.

01:58:43.049 --> 01:58:43.950
THE PLAN HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:58:44.016 --> 01:58:45.184
THE BENEFITS SURE HAS ACCESS TO

01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:49.489
A PROVIDER OF EQUAL -- SPECIALTY

01:58:49.555 --> 01:58:50.923
EXPERTISE BE IT.

01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:52.225
YOU KNOW WHATEVER DOCTOR BOB IS

01:58:52.291 --> 01:58:53.359
BUT IF TALK ABOUT REFUSES TO

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:56.195
CONTRACT -- THAN THE PLAN

01:58:56.262 --> 01:58:57.897
DOESN'T HAVE TO SEND THE

01:58:57.964 --> 01:58:59.098
BENEFICIARY THERE UNLESS.

01:58:59.165 --> 01:59:00.399
IF DOCTOR BOB IS THE ONLY

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:02.802
PROVIDER OF THAT SPECIALTY TYPE

01:59:02.869 --> 01:59:04.203
IN WHICH THE PATIENT HAS TO BE

01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:05.905
SEEN BY HIM BECAUSE THERE IS NO

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:07.173
ONE ELSE THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:07.740
THAT.

01:59:07.807 --> 01:59:11.777
THEN THE PLAN HAS TO SEND THE

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:12.378
BENEFITS YOU THERE AND PAY OUT

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:14.280
OF NETWORK GREAT.

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:15.281
THAT'S THE WAY THE CONTRACT

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:16.115
WORKS AND THAT'S THE WAY THE

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:16.716
ACCESS WORKS.

01:59:16.782 --> 01:59:17.316
SO THE PLAN HAS TO MAKE SURE

01:59:17.383 --> 01:59:18.117
THAT ALL THE SERVICES ARE

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:20.219
AVAILABLE -- THEY TRY VERY HARD

01:59:20.286 --> 01:59:21.754
OBVIOUSLY TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:23.523
IN NETWORK BUT FOR INSTANCES IN

01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:24.790
WHICH PROVIDERS REFUSED TO

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:27.059
CONTRACT -- THEN THEY HAVE TO

01:59:27.126 --> 01:59:28.761
SEND THE BENEFICIARY REGARDLESS

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:30.730
FOR PRIMARY CARE -- I WOULD SAY

01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:32.231
I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS

01:59:32.298 --> 01:59:33.900
OF AN ISSUE JUST BECAUSE THE

01:59:33.966 --> 01:59:36.035
BACKBONE OF OUR PRIMARY CASH

01:59:36.102 --> 01:59:38.437
CARE SYSTEM IS THROUGH FQHCS AND

01:59:38.504 --> 01:59:40.439
RURAL HEALTH CLINICS AND SO.

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:43.342
EVEN IN AREAS -- SUCH AS YOURS

01:59:43.409 --> 01:59:45.011
THAT THEY THERE SO THEY STILL

01:59:45.077 --> 01:59:46.779
MAY NEED TO TRAVEL BUT THE

01:59:46.846 --> 01:59:49.215
LIKELIHOOD OF AN FQHC BOTH

01:59:49.282 --> 01:59:50.616
CONTRACTING AND TAKING THOSE

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.985
PATIENTS IS IS PROBABLY NOT AS

01:59:53.052 --> 01:59:54.620
MUCH OF AN ISSUE AS IT WOULD BE

01:59:54.687 --> 01:59:57.557
LIKE A SPECIALTY PROVIDER THAT

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:58.157

RIGHT THANK YOU I ORDERED A MOVE

02:00:04.864 --> 02:00:07.033

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:13.205
THANK YOU MISTER.

02:00:13.272 --> 02:00:14.373
JUST THAT THAT YOU MAY ALREADY

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:15.708
COVERED THIS I APOLOGIZE FOR

02:00:15.775 --> 02:00:17.076
COMMINGLED.

02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:18.644
WITH WITH A WONDERFUL AFTERNOON

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:21.347
CALENDAR HELLO BUT HEAVY HELLO

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:22.481
MISS CAN'T HOW ARE YOU GOOD HOW

02:00:22.548 --> 02:00:27.753
ARE YOU I'M PLUGGING ALONG -- I

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:29.622
I CERTAINLY CAL OPTIMA BOARD AN

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:31.023
ORANGE COUNTY FOR FOUR YEARS AS

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:32.091
WELL BACK IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:33.793
WE HAD TO WAIT FOR THE BUDGET.

02:00:33.859 --> 02:00:35.861
TO BE APPROVED LIKE IN AUGUST

02:00:35.928 --> 02:00:37.830
SEPTEMBER SOMETIMES OCTOBER.

02:00:37.897 --> 02:00:40.066
BUT A ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS IS

02:00:40.132 --> 02:00:40.700
THAT -- MANY FAMILIES DO NOT

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:41.801
HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTH

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:43.169
CARE PROVIDERS DUE IN PART TO

02:00:43.235 --> 02:00:45.871
LOW MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:48.374
SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE NATION

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:48.975
AND SO WE EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN

02:00:49.041 --> 02:00:50.643
THERE WAS A BUDGET CRISIS SERVE

02:00:50.710 --> 02:00:52.478
RECESSION.

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:54.447
THE THE THE THE DOCTORS WOULD

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:56.148
GET A 10% CUT IN JUST SEEM LIKE

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:57.717
THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE TIMES I'M

02:00:57.783 --> 02:00:58.517
JUST WONDERING SINCE THE

02:00:58.584 --> 02:00:59.819
RECESSION HAVE.

02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:02.488
THOSE CUTS BEEN RESTORED AND AND

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:05.625
AND HAVE WE GOTTEN BACK UP.

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:07.426
TO STATE. TWO THOUSAND FIVE

02:01:07.493 --> 02:01:09.962
LEVELS AND WHAT ARE THE BUDGET.

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:12.331
PROPOSALS THAT YOU'LL BE MAKING

02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:12.932
TO MAYBE RAISE THE RATES SO WE

02:01:12.999 --> 02:01:14.367
CAN.

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:15.901
COMPENSATE OUR MEDICAL

02:01:15.968 --> 02:01:17.703
PROFESSIONALS A LITTLE BETTER

02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:20.406
SURE THAT'S A IT IS A MULTI --

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:22.475
STAGE QUESTIONS SO I WILL I WILL

02:01:22.541 --> 02:01:25.478
TRY AND ADDRESS AT ALL -- SO THE

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:27.813
AB NINETY SEVEN CUT THE 10% --

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:28.381
PHYSICIAN CUT HAS NOT BEEN

02:01:28.447 --> 02:01:31.417
RESTORED -- SO THAT IS STILL --

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:34.620
IN A FAX -- IN FEE FOR SERVICE

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:37.256
AS WELL AS THERE'S A WE CARRY

02:01:37.323 --> 02:01:39.959
THAT THAT -- REDUCTION IN THE

02:01:40.026 --> 02:01:41.193
MANAGED CARE RATES BUT IT'S IT'S

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:42.461
TREATED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:43.195
SO LET ME ADDRESS THAT

02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:46.465
SEPARATELY -- THE AB NINETY

02:01:46.532 --> 02:01:48.167
SEVEN CUTS HAVE BEEN RESTORED IN

02:01:48.234 --> 02:01:50.436
CERTAIN AREAS -- THE LEGISLATURE

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:51.971
MOST NOTABLY RESTORED THE DENTAL

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:52.905
CUT.

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:56.142
IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY

02:01:56.208 --> 02:01:56.809
SIXTEEN SO THAT WAS RESTORED BUT

02:01:56.876 --> 02:01:58.611
IN THE PHYSICIAN SIDE THAT HAS

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:02.715
NOT YET BEEN RESTORED -- WHEN

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:04.316
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MEDICARE RATES

02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:05.418
BEING SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE

02:02:05.484 --> 02:02:06.552
COUNTRY THEY'RE USUALLY

02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:08.421
REFERRING TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:10.723
SCHEDULE -- SO IN FEE FOR

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:12.825
SERVICE WE HAVE RATES ESTABLISH

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:14.126
FOR CERTAIN CODES AND THEY LOOK

02:02:14.193 --> 02:02:16.062
AT THOSE CODES AND THEY SAY IT'S

02:02:16.128 --> 02:02:17.730
YOU KNOW STANDARD EXAM CODE IS.

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:20.066
FIFTY DOLLARS AND SO THEREFORE

02:02:20.132 --> 02:02:22.501
THAT SLOWER THAN ANY OTHER STATE --

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:25.004
IN MANAGED CARE THE MANAGED CARE

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:27.473
PLANS AND THE ACTUARIAL RATES

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:29.408
THAT WE SET ARE NOT TETHERED OR

02:02:29.475 --> 02:02:31.143
TIED IN ANY WAY TO THE FEE FOR

02:02:31.210 --> 02:02:32.712
SERVICE RATE SCHEDULE.

02:02:32.778 --> 02:02:35.848
SO PLANS HAVE -- RATES THAT ARE

02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:38.050
BUILT ON THEIR ENCOUNTERS THEIR

02:02:38.117 --> 02:02:39.618
COSTS THEIR UTILIZATION OF

02:02:39.685 --> 02:02:43.089
SERVICES -- AND THOSE DO NOT

02:02:43.155 --> 02:02:45.291
REFLECT NECESSARILY WHAT THE FEE

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:46.826
FOR SERVICE RATES ARE SO PLANS

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:49.228
AND I HAVE BEEN IN THIS --

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:50.262
COMMITTEE ROOM ONE PLANS OF

02:02:50.329 --> 02:02:52.331
TESTIFIED THAT THEY PAY A 100%

02:02:52.398 --> 02:02:54.233
OF MEDICARE OR THEY PAY ABOVE

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:56.035
MEDICARE RATES FOR CERTAIN

02:02:56.102 --> 02:02:57.603
SERVICES WITH CERTAIN PROVIDERS.

02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:00.906
AND THAT IS FINE -- WE ALLOW IT --

02:03:00.973 --> 02:03:03.776
WE ACCOUNT FOR IT WHEN THEY TURN

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:06.445
IN THEIR RATE -- DATA TO US AS

02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:07.813
WE BUILD THEIR RATES ONGOING WE

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.281
OBVIOUSLY HAVE MITIGATION

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:11.751
STRATEGIES AND PLACE SUCH THAT.

02:03:11.817 --> 02:03:13.252
A PLANE COULDN'T JUST SAY I'M

02:03:13.319 --> 02:03:14.687
GOING TO BE.

02:03:14.754 --> 02:03:16.322
REALLY GENEROUS AND GIVE.

02:03:16.388 --> 02:03:18.124
YOU KNOW 4100% OF MEDICARE TO

02:03:18.190 --> 02:03:19.525
EVERYONE BECAUSE WE DO SOME

02:03:19.592 --> 02:03:21.193
COUNTY ADJUSTMENTS AND WE HAVE

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:23.095
SOME OTHER THINGS -- IN PLACE

02:03:23.162 --> 02:03:25.564
BUT PLANS HAVE TO MAINTAIN AN

02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:26.866
ADEQUATE NETWORK AND IN ORDER

02:03:26.932 --> 02:03:28.234
FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:29.502
NETWORK THEY HAVE TO PAY RATES

02:03:29.568 --> 02:03:30.636
AND WHICH PROVIDERS ARE WILLING

02:03:30.703 --> 02:03:31.804
TO CONTRACT WITH THEM.

02:03:31.871 --> 02:03:36.075
THAT IS IN NO WAY -- BEING

02:03:36.142 --> 02:03:36.942
IMPACTED BY THE FEE FOR SERVICE

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:38.477
RATE SCHEDULE AND SO THOSE TWO

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:40.079
ARE HANDLED VERY DIFFERENTLY AS

02:03:40.146 --> 02:03:41.547
AS WE SAT RATES AND SO.

02:03:41.614 --> 02:03:42.948
I'M HOPING THAT THAT ADDRESSES

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:45.050
YOUR QUESTION IN SOME PART JUST

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:47.253
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A PLAN AND

02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:47.787
YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH

02:03:47.853 --> 02:03:48.854
PROVIDERS.

02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:50.556
THE NEGOTIATION AND THE

02:03:50.623 --> 02:03:52.625
CONTRACTS AND THE FINANCING THAT

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:55.928
FLOWS IS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN --

02:03:55.995 --> 02:03:56.662
OTHER PARTS OF THE OF THE

02:03:56.729 --> 02:03:57.563
PROGRAM.

02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:59.665
SO WE'RE AT ENJOYING MAYBE A

02:03:59.732 --> 02:04:02.234
BUDGET SURPLUS AND SO OUR NEW

02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:02.568
GOVERNOR IS.

02:04:02.635 --> 02:04:04.470
FOUND A LOT OF PLACES TO PUT

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:05.070
TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:06.806
DOLLARS I'M JUST WONDERING DID

02:04:06.872 --> 02:04:08.040
YOU WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:10.309
FINANCE IS A EIGHT WE'VE GOT TO

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:10.709
START [inaudible]

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:12.178
HELPING.

02:04:12.244 --> 02:04:13.779
OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS SO THAT WE

02:04:13.846 --> 02:04:15.080
CAN MEET.

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:17.783
NO GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:20.052
ONE IN FIVE THEIR EVERY LEVEL.

02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:21.654
THIS IS THIS WOULD BE A GOOD

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:22.888
PRIORITY WAS WILL WAS THAT DONE

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:26.625
YEAH SO THERE'S SEVERAL PLACES --

02:04:26.692 --> 02:04:29.728
THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH --

02:04:29.795 --> 02:04:30.529
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE

02:04:30.596 --> 02:04:31.697
ADMINISTRATION MORE BROADLY

02:04:31.764 --> 02:04:33.432
AROUND THE APPLICATION OF THE

02:04:33.499 --> 02:04:35.935
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS --

02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:38.704
SO -- THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE

02:04:38.771 --> 02:04:40.639
FUNDS AS AN ADDITIVE AND A

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:43.609
SUPPLEMENTAL AMOUNT COMPARED TO

02:04:43.676 --> 02:04:44.510
THE BASE FUNDING THAT THE

02:04:44.577 --> 02:04:46.478
GENERAL FUND PAYS -- FOR CANNOT

02:04:46.545 --> 02:04:47.780
BE UNDERSTATED RIGHT THEY HAVE

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:50.616
BEEN TARGETED THEY HAVE BEEN --

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:52.518
AIMED AT PLACES IN THE PROGRAM

02:04:52.585 --> 02:04:54.220
THAT WE FELT NEEDED THE MOST --

02:04:54.286 --> 02:04:55.788
HELP SO NOT ONLY FOR PHYSICIANS

02:04:55.855 --> 02:04:58.457
AND DENTISTS BUT PROPOSITION

02:04:58.524 --> 02:04:59.425
FIFTY SIX FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:01.694
FOR HIV AIDS WAIVER AGENCIES FOR

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.429
INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR

02:05:03.495 --> 02:05:05.197
THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED.

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:06.999
FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES FOR

02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:08.701
PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE -- THERE

02:05:08.767 --> 02:05:10.469
WERE SOME TARGETED FUNDS LAST

02:05:10.536 --> 02:05:12.171
YEAR PROVIDED FOR SEA BASS

02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:15.307
DISABILITIES AND OTHERS AND SO --

02:05:15.374 --> 02:05:20.179
WE HAVE A BIG PROGRAM AND WE

02:05:20.246 --> 02:05:21.247
LARGELY LOOK AT AREAS IN WHICH

02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:23.883
WE FEEL -- ACCESSES --

02:05:23.949 --> 02:05:25.551
PROBLEMATIC LAST YEAR THERE WAS

02:05:25.618 --> 02:05:28.220
A HOME HEALTH -- RATE INCREASE

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:30.189
FOR HOME HEALTH AGENCIES A 50%

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:32.424
RATE INCREASE THAT WAS -- BOTH

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:34.026
PROPOSED AND APPROVED BY THE

02:05:34.093 --> 02:05:35.094
LEGISLATURE.

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.997
SO I WOULD SAY THAT THOSE ARE --

02:05:38.063 --> 02:05:41.567
THE DEPARTMENTS -- AREAS IN

02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:43.435
WHICH WE HAVE BOTH SIDES AND HAD

02:05:43.502 --> 02:05:44.536
AGREEMENT THAT RATE

02:05:44.603 --> 02:05:46.772
AUGMENTATIONS AND INCREASES WERE

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:48.274
APPROPRIATE AND SO THAT IS ALL

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:50.242
ACCORDING TO THE BENEFIT OF THE

02:05:50.309 --> 02:05:51.510
BENEFICIARY ULTIMATELY.

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:53.479
GREETING JUST A COUPLE QUICK

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:56.482
QUESTIONS -- YOU HAVE SOFTWARE

02:05:56.548 --> 02:06:00.152
TO MONITOR ALL OF I WILL LIKE TO

02:06:00.219 --> 02:06:03.756
SOFTWARE.

02:06:03.822 --> 02:06:05.724
I SO WE HAVE LOTS OF SOFTWARE WE

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:08.060
HAVE IS. TO TO HANDLE THE JOB

02:06:08.127 --> 02:06:08.827
BECAUSE WE GET SO MANY.

02:06:08.894 --> 02:06:11.330
SAD STORIES ABOUT SOFTWARE SO

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:12.398
I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOUR IDEAS

02:06:12.464 --> 02:06:12.598
YES.

02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:19.705
YES MY CHALLENGES -- IT

02:06:19.772 --> 02:06:21.006
KNOWLEDGE MEANT -- EARLIER -- WE

02:06:21.073 --> 02:06:22.007
HAVE CHALLENGES AND THE

02:06:22.074 --> 02:06:22.908
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AREA --

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:24.877
WITHIN OUR ENTERPRISE AT THE

02:06:24.944 --> 02:06:26.578
DEPARTMENT WE HAVE OVER A

02:06:26.645 --> 02:06:29.481
HUNDRED DISTINCT IT SYSTEMS --

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:33.485
AND SO THE CONTINUED EVOLUTION

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:35.120
OF THOSE SYSTEMS -- AND THE

02:06:35.187 --> 02:06:37.356
PROCESS BY WHICH THAT GETS DONE

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:40.859
IS CHALLENGING -- IT IS LONG --

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:43.762
SOMETIMES IT HAS OVERSIGHT BY

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:45.297
BOTH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY

02:06:45.364 --> 02:06:47.333
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AND

02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:48.834
THEN WE BECAUSE WE'RE MEDICAID

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:50.569
AGENCY WE HAVE TWO AND WE'RE

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:51.937
USING FEDERAL FUNDS WE HAVE

02:06:52.004 --> 02:06:53.038
OVERSIGHT PROVIDED BY THE

02:06:53.105 --> 02:06:54.340
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR I. T.

02:06:54.406 --> 02:06:55.174
PROJECTS.

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.142
SO I KNOW THAT -- WE HAVE A LOT

02:06:57.209 --> 02:06:59.278
OF SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:06:59.345 --> 02:07:01.981
NEEDS THAT -- NEED TO BE UPDATED

02:07:02.047 --> 02:07:03.816
SOME OF THOSE ARE IN PROCESS SO

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:05.784
MEDS IS OUR DATABASE OF RECORD

02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:07.686
IT'S OVER FORTY YEARS OLD IT'S A

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:09.121
COBALT DATABASE.

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:10.889
AND IT IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:13.792
ENTIRE PROGRAM -- AND SO.

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:15.527
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO INDULGE A

02:07:15.594 --> 02:07:17.930
JOKE ON MEDS I LIKE TO SAY THAT

02:07:17.997 --> 02:07:20.666
IT IS -- EXTRAORDINARILY SAFE

02:07:20.733 --> 02:07:23.902
BECAUSE NO ONE HAS FIGURED OUT

02:07:23.969 --> 02:07:26.505
HOW TO HACK A COUPLE -- AND THAT

02:07:26.572 --> 02:07:27.072
WHEN WE NEED PROGRAMMERS WE

02:07:27.139 --> 02:07:28.007
RECRUIT RECRUIT FROM SKILLED

02:07:28.073 --> 02:07:30.876
NURSING FACILITIES SO THERE'S MY

02:07:30.943 --> 02:07:34.346
MEDS DATABASE JOKE BUT I. T. IS

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:35.481
A CHALLENGE FOR US AND THAT IS

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:37.549
SOMETHING THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:39.251
AND WE WISH WE WERE FASTER.

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:40.486
AT BEING ABLE TO MODIFIER

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:42.554
SYSTEMS -- SOME OF THAT IS JUST

02:07:42.621 --> 02:07:44.890
THE NATURE OF STATE LARGE STATE

02:07:44.957 --> 02:07:46.825
I. T. PROJECTS -- THAT YOU KNOW

02:07:46.892 --> 02:07:49.695
ARE SIGNIFICANT IN NATURE AND SO --

02:07:49.762 --> 02:07:51.063
THE PROGRAMMING AROUND RATE

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:52.531
INCREASES HAS CERTAINLY BEEN

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:55.134
SLOW -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A AGAIN

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.769
A SYSTEM THAT DOES OUR CLAIMS

02:07:56.835 --> 02:07:58.003
FOR FEE FOR SERVICE AND

02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:59.204
PROGRAMMING THAT SOME TAKE

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:00.806
SOMETIMES TAKES UP TO A YEAR.

02:08:00.873 --> 02:08:02.307
IN ORDER THE MONEY'S GOOD IT

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:04.143
FLOWS BACK TO THE DATE THAT THE

02:08:04.209 --> 02:08:05.844
RATE INCREASE WAS PROVIDED BUT

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:08.280
IN SOME CASES THAT LACK HAS BEEN.

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:10.215
YOU KNOW SIX NINE TEN MONTHS AND

02:08:10.282 --> 02:08:12.918
SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND WEIRD.

02:08:12.985 --> 02:08:15.387
WE HAVE THAT ON ON THE SCHEDULE

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:16.855
TO IMPROVE AND AND MODERNIZE

02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:18.023
THAT SYSTEM.

02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:21.460
SO LAST QUESTION AND MAYBE FIFTY

02:08:21.527 --> 02:08:22.494
WORDS OR LESS.

02:08:22.561 --> 02:08:24.696
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION OR OF OF

02:08:24.763 --> 02:08:30.402
THE AUDIT -- YOU KNOW I DON'T

02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:32.204
LIKE GETTING OUT IT'S LIKE THIS --

02:08:32.271 --> 02:08:34.006
I LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR PROGRAM

02:08:34.073 --> 02:08:36.141
IS CONSTANTLY IMPROVING -- THIS

02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:38.577
WAS CERTAINLY -- AUDIT IN WHICH

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:40.612
WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND NEED TO DO

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:42.948
BETTER -- AND SO WE'RE COMMITTED

02:08:43.015 --> 02:08:45.584
TO DOING THAT -- IN SOME CASES I

02:08:45.651 --> 02:08:49.354
THINK THAT -- IT WAS A FAIR --

02:08:49.421 --> 02:08:51.123
ASSESSMENT OF THE DATA AND SO

02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:52.458
YOU CAN'T.

02:08:52.524 --> 02:08:54.393
YOU CAN'T FAULT THE DATA AND SO

02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:56.228
WE ARE LOOKING AHEAD AS TO HOW

02:08:56.295 --> 02:08:59.231
WE IMPROVE HOW WE HOLD OUR PLANS

02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:00.899
ACCOUNTABLE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

02:09:00.966 --> 02:09:02.267
THAT SERVICES ARE ARE BEING

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:03.535
DELIVERED TO THE FAMILIES AND

02:09:03.602 --> 02:09:05.471
THE CHILDREN THAT WE SERVE AND

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:07.372
WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING BETTER.

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:08.941
THANK YOU MS THANK YOU MISTER

02:09:09.007 --> 02:09:12.344

THANK YOU AND TERM OR LACKEY ONE

02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:15.247
OF THE THINGS IN THE US ABOUT

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:15.848
THE BUDGET EARLIER. ONE OF THE

02:09:15.914 --> 02:09:17.583
THINGS I FOUND FASCINATING AND

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:18.984
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET COMPARED TO A

02:09:19.051 --> 02:09:20.686
PREVIOUS YEARS BUDGETS AS ALL

02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:22.254
THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX MONEY

02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:24.089
RIGHT NOW IS ALLOCATED ACTUALLY

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:25.824
TO HELP TOWARDS -- MEDICARE

02:09:25.891 --> 02:09:27.526
REIMBURSEMENT RATES WERE BEFORE

02:09:27.593 --> 02:09:28.527
IT WAS DIVVIED UP.

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:31.263
SO TO YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION

02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:33.699
WHAT THAT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:34.299
WOMAN WATER.

02:09:34.366 --> 02:09:35.033
THANK YOU I'M JUST REALLY

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:36.768
BRIEFLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:09:36.835 --> 02:09:41.540
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY OF

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:43.075
MINE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT --

02:09:43.142 --> 02:09:44.409
CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN WITH

02:09:44.476 --> 02:09:46.111
VARYING ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS --

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:47.412
THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE ABLE TO

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:49.014
ACCESS CARE.

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:50.949
IN NAVIGATE A VERY COMPLEX

02:09:51.016 --> 02:09:53.952
SYSTEM THAT EVEN FOR US WITH

02:09:54.019 --> 02:09:56.922
INSURANCES HARD TO NAVIGATE --

02:09:56.989 --> 02:09:58.657
AND TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:00.626
DISPARITIES YOU KNOW BETWEEN

02:10:00.692 --> 02:10:03.262
ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS AND ACCESSING --

02:10:03.328 --> 02:10:05.797
HOW YOU KNOW BEYOND MAILINGS TO

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:07.199
THEM AND IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.634
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.335
EVEN GET THAT INTO THE HANDS OF

02:10:10.402 --> 02:10:12.404
THE ACTUAL CARE GIVER -- WHAT WE

02:10:12.471 --> 02:10:14.606
IS COULD THAT BE IMPROVED AS FAR

02:10:14.673 --> 02:10:16.208
AS BEING ABLE TO TARGET?

02:10:16.275 --> 02:10:19.378
YOU KNOW -- COMMUNITIES OR

02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:21.513
PEOPLE WHO NEED TO ACCESS CARE

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:22.848
WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT CRAP

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:26.118
EARLIER THE DROP OFF IN A YEAR

02:10:26.185 --> 02:10:27.019
ONE AND YEAR TWO WE WERE SAYING

02:10:27.085 --> 02:10:28.120
WELL OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THOSE

02:10:28.187 --> 02:10:29.721
YEARS IN BETWEEN BEFORE THEY

02:10:29.788 --> 02:10:31.056
START PRESCHOOL.

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:32.291
YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S KINDA KICKS

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:33.992
BACK UP WAS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:37.129
AT YEAH I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:39.231
WAS BORN WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF.

02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:42.000
IN THE MAIL FROM YOU KNOW EVEN

02:10:42.067 --> 02:10:44.136
YOU KNOW PAMPERS OR JANE JAY OR

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:45.237
WHATEVER WOULD SEND US WITH

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:47.206
SAMPLES AND THEY ALWAYS INCLUDE

02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:48.740
THE VACCINE SCHEDULE OR MAKE

02:10:48.807 --> 02:10:50.642
SURE YOU HAVE YOUR WELL BABY.

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:52.244
BUT THEN AFTER THAT IT KIND OF

02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:53.645
DROPPED OFF.

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:55.180
UNTIL WE START SCHOOL IN IN THIS

02:10:55.247 --> 02:10:57.616
MORE OF A SOCIAL NETWORK YOU'RE

02:10:57.683 --> 02:11:00.185
EVEN TO THE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OR

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:01.620
DAY CARE OR WHATEVER.

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:03.655
HOW WHAT WAYS CAN THAT IMPROVE

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:04.856
THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT

02:11:04.923 --> 02:11:07.226
ACTUALLY SEEING THE PRIMARY CARE

02:11:07.292 --> 02:11:09.094
OR A PEDIATRICIAN?

02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:09.795
THAT.

02:11:09.861 --> 02:11:10.996
THERE'S A WAY TO COMMUNICATE IN

02:11:11.063 --> 02:11:12.831
THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY KNOW SO

02:11:12.898 --> 02:11:14.700
THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY.

02:11:14.766 --> 02:11:15.701
NAVIGATION AND YEAH SO I THINK

02:11:15.767 --> 02:11:17.236
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK

02:11:17.302 --> 02:11:18.837
THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:21.106
WORKING WITH OUR OTHER SISTER

02:11:21.173 --> 02:11:22.407
DEPARTMENTS -- YOU KNOW

02:11:22.474 --> 02:11:23.609
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS

02:11:23.675 --> 02:11:25.077
IT PERTAINS TO THE BLACK INFANT

02:11:25.143 --> 02:11:26.311
HEALTH PROGRAM.

02:11:26.378 --> 02:11:28.046
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:29.648
WHICH SERVES A LOT OF CAO WORKS

02:11:29.715 --> 02:11:31.717
FAMILIES AND HOME VISITING -- I

02:11:31.783 --> 02:11:34.119
THINK THAT -- DEPENDING ON THE

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:35.554
DISPARITY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:39.057
ADDRESS -- THERE ARE SOMETIMES --

02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:42.694
APPROPRIATE AND IS CRITICAL --

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:43.795
INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE

02:11:43.862 --> 02:11:46.598
PROVIDED THROUGH LIKE -- THERE

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:54.673
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOULAS --

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:56.708
TO HELP IMPROVE -- BIRTH RATES

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:57.209
IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:11:57.276 --> 02:11:58.877
COMMUNITY FROM A TODAS -- IN THE

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:00.846
LATINO COMMUNITY -- CERTAINLY

02:12:00.912 --> 02:12:02.414
AROUND -- ASTHMA DIABETES

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:05.550
SOMETIMES THE CULTURAL -- DIVIDE

02:12:05.617 --> 02:12:07.719
BETWEEN A A BENEFICIARY AND THE

02:12:07.786 --> 02:12:10.022
PHYSICIANS OFFICE IS JUST TOO

02:12:10.088 --> 02:12:11.189
SIGNIFICANT AND THEY'RE NOT

02:12:11.256 --> 02:12:12.691
COMFORTABLE TALKING TO THEIR

02:12:12.758 --> 02:12:14.359
PROVIDER AT OR AND WE'VE REALLY

02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:15.827
BEEN STRUGGLING IN THE MENTAL

02:12:15.894 --> 02:12:16.395
HEALTH AREA RIGHT THERE ARE

02:12:16.461 --> 02:12:17.262
CERTAIN.

02:12:17.329 --> 02:12:18.397
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE JUST NOT

02:12:18.463 --> 02:12:21.099
COMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGING OR

02:12:21.166 --> 02:12:22.801
SEEKING MEDICAL OUR MISSILE

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:25.437
HEALTH CARE AND SO I THINK --

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:27.806
OUR INTEREST AS A PROGRAM IS

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:30.409
LOOKING AT BOTH TRADITIONAL

02:12:30.475 --> 02:12:31.743
PROVIDERS THAT SERVE THAT

02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:33.679
COMMUNITY -- AS WELL AS

02:12:33.745 --> 02:12:35.213
ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS THAT CAN

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:36.682
HELP ASSIST IN TERMS OF MAKING

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.317
BENEFICIARIES FEEL COMFORTABLE

02:12:38.383 --> 02:12:39.351
ARE HELPING DO.

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:41.253
PATIENT AT EDUCATION NAVIGATION

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.422
SUPPORT AND SO DEPENDING ON THE

02:12:43.488 --> 02:12:46.124
DISPARITY THAT YOU'RE TRYING --

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:47.793
TO ADDRESS THERE'S DIFFERENT

02:12:47.859 --> 02:12:49.628
WAYS IN WHICH WE WOULD DO IT BUT

02:12:49.695 --> 02:12:50.929
I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IT'S A

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:52.764
IT'S A MUCH MORE LOCAL COMMUNITY

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:54.199
BASED ORGANIZATION APPROACH AND

02:12:54.266 --> 02:12:55.634
IN MY MIND I DON'T THINK IT'S A

02:12:55.701 --> 02:12:57.936
STATE -- BASED WAY IN THE END

02:12:58.003 --> 02:12:59.271
UNLESS WE'RE JUST PAIN TO HELP

02:12:59.338 --> 02:13:03.141
SUPPORT THAT EFFORT AT A LOCAL

02:13:03.208 --> 02:13:06.078
LEVEL.

02:13:06.144 --> 02:13:06.845
THANK YOU.

02:13:06.912 --> 02:13:08.313
AND IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:09.715
THAT QUESTION SO WOULD DCH US

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:11.950
THEN BE REQUIRING THE PLANS TO

02:13:12.017 --> 02:13:12.984
COME UP WITH.

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:14.586
A WAY TO GET AT THESE CULTURAL

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:15.520
DISPARITIES THAT WERE OUTLINED

02:13:15.587 --> 02:13:17.389
IN THE AUDIT YOU KNOW I KNOW

02:13:17.456 --> 02:13:17.989
BACK HOME YOU MENTIONED IT TO

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:19.491
YOU -- THE FROM WITHOUT US RIGHT

02:13:19.558 --> 02:13:20.158
THAT'S A GOOD PROGRAM THAT I SEE

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:21.493
THAT GETS OUT THERE TO TRY TO

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.929
GET SOME OF THIS INFORMATION --

02:13:23.995 --> 02:13:24.996
BUT IS THIS SOMETHING IN THE

02:13:25.063 --> 02:13:26.365
FUTURE S. IS NOW MOVING TOWARDS

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:27.733
MORE TALKING ABOUT --

02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:29.067
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS OR MAYBE

02:13:29.134 --> 02:13:32.070
REQUIRING -- THE THE PLANTS TO

02:13:32.137 --> 02:13:33.805
DO THIS YES SO I THINK PART OF

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:36.108
THE MULTITUDE OF THINGS THAT

02:13:36.174 --> 02:13:37.542
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE PLANS ON

02:13:37.609 --> 02:13:39.678
TO HELP ADDRESS THESE -- AREAS

02:13:39.745 --> 02:13:42.080
AROUND THE AUDIT WAS THE THERE'S

02:13:42.147 --> 02:13:44.750
A HEALTH DISPARITIES REPORT AND

02:13:44.816 --> 02:13:46.385
PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO DO GROUP

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:48.286
NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THEY

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:49.654
DEVELOP THEIR OWN SPECIFIC

02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:52.691
EVALUATION REPORT I THINK THAT.

02:13:52.758 --> 02:13:54.659
EACH PLAYER AS A PART OF THEIR

02:13:54.726 --> 02:13:57.229

PROJECTS AND SO SOME OF THE

02:14:00.732 --> 02:14:02.401
THINGS THAT -- WE'RE TALKING

02:14:02.467 --> 02:14:04.369
ABOUT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:05.771
PLANS IN THE PAST AND I THINK WE

02:14:05.837 --> 02:14:06.905
WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT

02:14:06.972 --> 02:14:08.173
ENCOURAGE -- AND HOLD THEM

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:09.641
ACCOUNTABLE TO DO MORE OF THAT

02:14:09.708 --> 02:14:11.376
IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU ADDRESS

02:14:11.443 --> 02:14:13.011
DISPARITIES WITHIN YOUR OWN PLAN

02:14:13.078 --> 02:14:14.413
SO WE'RE REQUIRING THE PLANS TO

02:14:14.479 --> 02:14:15.514
LOOK AT THEIR MEMBERSHIP AND SAY

02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:19.217
WE SEE DISPARITIES IN --

02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:20.852
MEDICATION MANAGEMENT FOR

02:14:20.919 --> 02:14:23.288
HYPERTENSION AND BECAUSE WE SEE

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:27.092
THAT -- THAT YOU KNOW -- Là

02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:27.859
MAKING THIS UP -- YOU KNOW OUR

02:14:27.926 --> 02:14:30.162
POPULATION WITHIN THIS PLAN THE

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:31.930
AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION IS

02:14:31.997 --> 02:14:37.202
NOT CONSISTENTLY -- KEEPING UP

02:14:37.269 --> 02:14:37.836
WITH ITS MEDICATION MANAGEMENT

02:14:37.903 --> 02:14:38.336
THE SAME WAY THAT OTHER

02:14:38.403 --> 02:14:38.937
POPULATIONS ARE WE WOULD BE

02:14:39.004 --> 02:14:39.538
LOOKING TO THE PLAN TO BOTH

02:14:39.604 --> 02:14:41.139
IDENTIFY THAT AS A NEED AND THEN

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:42.207
TO COME TO US WITH A VERY

02:14:42.274 --> 02:14:43.809
SPECIFIC WAY AND HOW THEY WANT

02:14:43.875 --> 02:14:44.843
TO ADDRESS THAT.

02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:46.244
IS SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KIND

02:14:46.311 --> 02:14:48.713
OF QUALITY -- BOTH OUTCOMES AND

02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:50.248
FOLLOW UP THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:51.316
WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE BUT WE'RE

02:14:51.383 --> 02:14:52.284
LOOKING TO BE BOTH MORE

02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:54.085
CONSISTENT AND MORE INTENTIONAL

02:14:54.152 --> 02:14:57.923
AND HOW WE FOLLOW THE PLANS AS

02:14:57.989 --> 02:14:58.490
THEY DO THOSE ACTIVITIES ON

02:14:58.557 --> 02:14:59.491
THEIR OWN.

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:00.492
YEAH AND I APPRECIATE THAT

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:01.059
BECAUSE I REMEMBER A LOT OF

02:15:01.126 --> 02:15:02.194
REPORTED EVEN TALK ABOUT AFRICAN

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:04.196
AMERICANS ONLY BEING AT 40%

02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:07.032
UTILIZATION. FOR FOR SOME THINGS

02:15:07.098 --> 02:15:08.166
ARE REFERENCING RIGHT WHAT THAT

02:15:08.233 --> 02:15:10.569

YOU JUST MAY JUST SOMEONE JUST

02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:17.275
KIND OF PUT A RED FLAG UP ON ME

02:15:17.342 --> 02:15:18.910
IN THAT WAS THAT -- YOU HAVE

02:15:18.977 --> 02:15:21.046
NUMEROUS SOFTWARE SYSTEMS THAT

02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:22.514
YOU ARE WORKING WITH.

02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:24.783
AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:26.518
INTEGRATION OF ALL THOSE.

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:27.352
IT MIGHT BE WORKING FOR YOU

02:15:27.419 --> 02:15:28.086
TODAY.

02:15:28.153 --> 02:15:29.554
I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S

02:15:29.621 --> 02:15:31.156
GONNA LOOK LIKE IN FIVE YEARS.

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:33.158
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN WE LOOK AT

02:15:33.225 --> 02:15:35.126
SOFTWARE -- AND UPGRADES AND

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:36.027
CHANGES IS A SUMMER

02:15:36.094 --> 02:15:38.797
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE PEOPLE

02:15:38.864 --> 02:15:39.164
WILL BE LIVING.

02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:40.732
RETIRING.

02:15:40.799 --> 02:15:41.666
AND I ALWAYS AND FEARFUL WHEN I

02:15:41.733 --> 02:15:42.834
HEAR THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO

02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:44.302
WAIT AND THAT'S NOT.

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:45.871
A TOP PRIORITY RIGHT AWAY A

02:15:45.937 --> 02:15:47.539
MAYBE IT IS BUT I'M CONCERNED

02:15:47.606 --> 02:15:49.508
THAT THE LONGER WE WAIT THE

02:15:49.574 --> 02:15:51.243
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS GONE.

02:15:51.309 --> 02:15:52.544
TO ACTUALLY HELPED IMPLEMENT A

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:54.379
GOOD SOFTWARE SYSTEM IT'S GOING

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:56.381
TO BE RUN AND RUNNING AND ROBUST.

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:59.985
FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO -- DO YOU

02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:01.486
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT OR

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:03.421
THANK YOU -- AND AND MY CHAU

02:16:03.488 --> 02:16:05.123
SEARS ARE PROBABLY BURNING AS I

02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:08.860
INVOKE HIS NAME -- SO THERE IS --

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:10.128
A POLICY THAT THE FEDERAL

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:12.330
GOVERNMENT HAS PUT FORWARD TO

02:16:12.397 --> 02:16:13.865
MEDICAID AGENCIES IN PARTICULAR

02:16:13.932 --> 02:16:16.468
AROUND -- ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:19.771
SO -- MY TO IS THE MEDICAID

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:21.339
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL

02:16:21.406 --> 02:16:23.975
ARCHITECTURE -- AND WE ASA

02:16:24.042 --> 02:16:25.443
STATE WHEN WE ARE CLAIMING

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.779
ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDS TO DO

02:16:27.846 --> 02:16:29.214
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS.

02:16:29.281 --> 02:16:30.682
IN THE PROCESS OF SEEKING THOSE

02:16:30.749 --> 02:16:33.385
ENHANCED FUNDS -- WE HAVE TO

02:16:33.451 --> 02:16:35.587
BASICALLY DEMONSTRATE THE

02:16:35.654 --> 02:16:38.823
BROADER APPLICABILITY TO LARGER.

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:39.691
AND LARGER PORTIONS OF OUR

02:16:39.758 --> 02:16:40.759
ENTERPRISE MEANING THEY DON'T

02:16:40.825 --> 02:16:42.294
WANT US TO COME AND JUST SAY I'M

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:43.295
LOOKING.

02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:45.397
TO DO ONE SYSTEM FOR THIS ONE

02:16:45.463 --> 02:16:46.498
THING THEY WANT TO SEE A A

02:16:46.565 --> 02:16:48.300
BROADER -- PROPOSAL THAT

02:16:48.366 --> 02:16:50.702
INCORPORATES -- LARGER PARTS OF

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:52.637
THE PROGRAM AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:54.406
WE'RE NOT JUST -- SILO IN ALL OF

02:16:54.472 --> 02:16:56.541
THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY.

02:16:56.608 --> 02:17:04.115
AND SO -- THOSE FOR FUNDS ARE

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:05.517
SUCH THAT IT IS -- HARD FOR

02:17:05.584 --> 02:17:06.585
STATES TO NOT DO THAT IT'S A

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:08.787
NINETY TEN MATCH SO -- WE HAVE --

02:17:08.853 --> 02:17:10.288
A SERIES OF CONSISTENT --

02:17:10.355 --> 02:17:10.922
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT WE'RE

02:17:10.989 --> 02:17:12.757
DOING -- TO LOOK MORE BROADLY I

02:17:12.824 --> 02:17:14.926
WOULD -- NOTE THAT THE COUNTIES

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:17.395
HAVE THREE CURRENT --

02:17:17.462 --> 02:17:19.130
ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS THE

02:17:19.197 --> 02:17:21.166
CONSORTIUM AND THE FEDERAL

02:17:21.232 --> 02:17:22.701
GOVERNMENT HAS SAID -- AND THEY

02:17:22.767 --> 02:17:25.303
ARE ON TRACK TO DO THIS BY

02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:25.837
TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS TO

02:17:25.904 --> 02:17:27.539
CONSOLIDATE THOSE INTO A SINGLE

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:28.740
SYSTEM FOR THE STATE SO THERE

02:17:28.807 --> 02:17:30.275
WILL BE A SINGLE STATEWIDE

02:17:30.342 --> 02:17:31.810
COUNTY CONSORTIUM SYSTEM --

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:34.312
WHICH IS A LOT OF WORK -- IT'S

02:17:34.379 --> 02:17:35.947
GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF CHANGE

02:17:36.014 --> 02:17:37.782
THEY HAVE REALLY -- EMBRACED IT

02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:39.384
AND WE ARE KIND OF MOVING

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:40.285
THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF HOW DO

02:17:40.352 --> 02:17:41.953
YOU TURN THOSE SYSTEMS INTO A

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:44.089
SINGLE SYSTEM BUT YOUR POINT IS

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:45.824
ABSOLUTELY WELL TAKEN AND I

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:47.325
THINK IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

02:17:47.392 --> 02:17:48.627
THAT I REALLY EMBRACE WHEN I WAS

02:17:48.693 --> 02:17:52.197
THE DIRECTOR -- WHEN I FIRST

02:17:52.263 --> 02:17:52.931
STARTED TWENTY FIFTEEN IS?

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:53.698
THERE'S ADMINISTRATIVE AND

02:17:53.765 --> 02:17:55.433
OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:58.003
HAS TO BE BUILT IF THE PROGRAM

02:17:58.069 --> 02:18:00.271
ITSELF IS GOING TO BE STABLE.

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.506
TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW

02:18:01.573 --> 02:18:03.508
AND SO -- IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY

02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:05.043
EXCITING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.811
I ACTUALLY HAVE SPENT A FAIR

02:18:06.878 --> 02:18:09.080
AMOUNT OF TIME -- ON I. T. JUST

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:10.682
BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THAT IT

02:18:10.749 --> 02:18:13.151
EXISTS LONG AFTER ANY OF US ARE

02:18:13.218 --> 02:18:20.125
IN THESE POSITIONS BUT RISK AND

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:21.760
SO I THINK A LOT OF US -- SPEND

02:18:21.826 --> 02:18:23.228
A LOT OF TIME WORKING IN THAT

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:24.863
PARTICULAR AREA.

02:18:24.929 --> 02:18:26.131
WELL AS WE KNOW WE'VE HAD

02:18:26.197 --> 02:18:28.500
PROJECTS WITHIN THE STATE THAT

02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:30.001
HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL OF HIM.

02:18:30.068 --> 02:18:30.935
UPGRADES AND CHANGES THE

02:18:31.002 --> 02:18:33.672
SOFTWARE I I DON'T WANT TO BE

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:34.572
ONE OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS YEAH.

02:18:34.639 --> 02:18:36.007
I DON'T EITHER BUT I JUST THINK

02:18:36.074 --> 02:18:37.575
WE NEED TO BE REALLY VISIONARY

02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:39.344
AND TO FACE THE FACT THAT THESE

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:40.645
THINGS TAKE SOME TIME.

02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:41.813
ON THE SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT MUCH

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:43.548
TIME BUT YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONAL

02:18:43.615 --> 02:18:44.683
KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T ALWAYS WANT TO

02:18:44.749 --> 02:18:45.984
GIVE OUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE.

02:18:46.051 --> 02:18:47.686
AND IT SLOWS DOWN A PROJECT AND

02:18:47.752 --> 02:18:49.587
I'VE BEEN -- INVOLVE SOME OF

02:18:49.654 --> 02:18:51.222
THOSE PROJECTS IN THE PAST AND

02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:53.391
IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING SO --

02:18:53.458 --> 02:18:54.292
THE SOONER WE GET THOSE PEOPLE

02:18:54.359 --> 02:18:56.828
THAT THINK TO GET ON BOARD TO

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.897
HELP BEFORE THE GUN -- RETIRE

02:18:58.963 --> 02:19:00.365
WHATEVER THAT WOULD BE VERY

02:19:00.432 --> 02:19:02.033
HELPFUL BUT I HAVE TO ONE WOMAN

02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:03.568
IN MY I. T. SHOP WHO HAS BEEN

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:08.206

02:20:07.065 --> 02:20:08.900
AUDIT REPORT -- DO YOU THINK YOU

02:20:08.967 --> 02:20:10.001
SAID IT WAS FAIR.

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:12.170
BALANCED AND SO LOOK FOR THAT

02:20:12.237 --> 02:20:14.139
MISTER WHAT HAS THE COUPLE

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:16.107
QUESTIONS YEAH -- CLOSE PANEL

02:20:16.174 --> 02:20:18.843
THAT YEAH AS AS TALK AS

02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:19.778
QUESTIONS GET ANSWERED IT IT'S

02:20:19.844 --> 02:20:21.246
THAT SPURS OTHER THOUGHTS AND

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:22.781
AND OTHER QUESTIONS AND ONE WAS

02:20:22.847 --> 02:20:24.449
YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT

02:20:24.516 --> 02:20:26.050
OBVIOUSLY PLANS HAVE THE ABILITY

02:20:26.117 --> 02:20:27.786
TO NEGOTIATE WITH SOME OTHER

02:20:27.852 --> 02:20:29.387
PROVIDERS FOR FOR SOME THESE

02:20:29.454 --> 02:20:30.388
CONTRACTS.

02:20:30.455 --> 02:20:31.790
AND THEN YOU SAID YOU THAT COMS

02:20:31.856 --> 02:20:34.192
BACK AS PART OF A REVIEW.

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:39.230
OF LATER ON SO.

02:20:39.297 --> 02:20:40.865
DOES THE DEPARTMENT SAY WELL YOU

02:20:40.932 --> 02:20:41.466
GUYS BEEN PAYING TOO MUCH AND

02:20:41.533 --> 02:20:42.367
JUST TO PUT THE THUMB ON THE

02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:44.736
SCALES THERE -- OR HOW DOES HOW

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:46.938
DOES THAT WORK -- IN IN THAT

02:20:47.005 --> 02:20:48.706
ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THOSE ARE

02:20:48.773 --> 02:20:50.074
RATES THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY HIGHER.

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:52.243
THAN THAN WHAT THE TYPICAL

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:53.711
ALLOWANCE WOULD BE SO.

02:20:53.778 --> 02:20:54.712
I'M GONNA GET MYSELF INTO

02:20:54.779 --> 02:20:57.182
TROUBLE -- AND MY RATES PEOPLE

02:20:57.248 --> 02:20:59.117
WILL PROBABLY.

02:20:59.184 --> 02:21:00.051
TAKE UMBRAGE AT THIS.

02:21:00.118 --> 02:21:01.753
SO THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:04.155
OF DATA THAT COME TO US -- AND

02:21:04.222 --> 02:21:05.190
THE RATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

02:21:05.256 --> 02:21:07.325
FROM THE PLANS -- ACROSS A

02:21:07.392 --> 02:21:09.961
VARIETY OF AREAS HOSPITAL

02:21:10.028 --> 02:21:11.262
OUTPATIENT PHARMACY.

02:21:11.329 --> 02:21:12.964
DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT ALL

02:21:13.031 --> 02:21:15.633
THE DIFFERENT RATE AREAS -- AND

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:18.269
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT PLANS ARE

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:20.905
SEEN INCREASED UTILIZATION OR

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:22.006
INCREASE COSTS.

02:21:22.073 --> 02:21:23.708
THAT IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE

02:21:23.775 --> 02:21:25.577
RATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IT

02:21:25.643 --> 02:21:27.912
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ACCEPT IT --

02:21:27.979 --> 02:21:29.914
AT FACE VALUE AND JUST SAY --

02:21:29.981 --> 02:21:31.749
YOU KNOW YOU PAID YOU DECIDED TO

02:21:31.816 --> 02:21:33.818
PAY A PROVIDER US I MAKING THIS

02:21:33.885 --> 02:21:35.086
UP A THOUSAND DOLLARS A

02:21:35.153 --> 02:21:36.721
CONSULTATION -- AND SO WE'RE

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:37.555
JUST GOING TO BUILD THAT INTO

02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:39.123
YOUR RATES AND THAT'S GOOD WHAT

02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:42.927
WE DO IS E HAVE A WAY IN WHICH

02:21:42.994 --> 02:21:43.928
WE LOOK AT THAT AND SAY.

02:21:43.995 --> 02:21:45.797
YOU KNOW FOR SIMILARLY SITUATED

02:21:45.864 --> 02:21:47.665
RATES AND OTHER AREAS ARE YOU

02:21:47.732 --> 02:21:49.667
PAYING YOUR PROVIDERS A THOUSAND

02:21:49.734 --> 02:21:50.635
DOLLARS A CONSULTATION ARE YOU

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:52.537
PAYING THE FIVE HUNDRED YOU KNOW

02:21:52.604 --> 02:21:53.538
AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE OTHER

02:21:53.605 --> 02:21:55.273
PLAN IN WHICH YOU KNOW MOST OF

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.008
OUR PLANS HAVE OTHER PLANS IN

02:21:57.075 --> 02:21:58.610
THE SAME SERVICE AREA.

02:21:58.676 --> 02:21:59.477
YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THEIR

02:21:59.544 --> 02:22:01.079
COSTS ARE AND IF THERE COSTS ARE

02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:02.413
SIMILARLY SITUATED YOU'RE SAYING

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:04.282
WELL THAT'S JUST WHAT THE MARKET.

02:22:04.349 --> 02:22:06.150
IS IF YOU ARE AN OUT LIAR AND

02:22:06.217 --> 02:22:07.452
YOU'RE PAYING A THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:22:07.518 --> 02:22:08.686
FOR A CONSULTATION AND THE OTHER

02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:10.488
PLANS ARE PAYING TWO HUNDRED

02:22:10.555 --> 02:22:12.090
REPUBLICAN AND NUDGE THAT DOWN.

02:22:12.156 --> 02:22:13.458
BECAUSE YOU'RE CLEARLY DOING

02:22:13.524 --> 02:22:15.493
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT IN KEEPING

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:16.361
WITH THAT.

02:22:16.427 --> 02:22:17.929
SO WE DO AVERAGING WITHIN THE

02:22:17.996 --> 02:22:19.898
PLAN AND WE DO AVERAGING FOR

02:22:19.964 --> 02:22:21.566
PLANS AGAINST EACH OTHER AND

02:22:21.633 --> 02:22:26.804
THEN WE HAVE OTHER TYPES AS LIKE

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:28.539
IN IN PHARMACY WE HAVE --

02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:31.376
PHARMACY EQUIVALENCY -- I'M NOT

02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:33.144
USING THE WORDS CORRECTLY BUT WE

02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:34.345
HAVE WAYS IN WHICH WE SAY IT

02:22:34.412 --> 02:22:36.114
LOOKS LIKE YOU SHOULD BE USING

02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:37.382
MORE GENERICS AND YOU'VE BEEN

02:22:37.448 --> 02:22:38.650
USING HIGHER BRANDS YOUR

02:22:38.716 --> 02:22:39.918
PHARMACY COSTS ARE NOT IN

02:22:39.984 --> 02:22:40.752
KEEPING WITH WHAT WE WOULD

02:22:40.818 --> 02:22:41.920
EXPECT THEM TO BE AND SO WE'RE

02:22:41.986 --> 02:22:42.453
GOING TO ADD.

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:45.223
A FACTOR TO THAT TO KIND OF

02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:46.591
DRIVE IT DOWN INTO FORCE THE

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:49.027
PLAN. TO TO MODIFY THAT SO THE

02:22:49.093 --> 02:22:50.194
RATE PROCESSES.

02:22:50.261 --> 02:22:51.429
FAR MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT

02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:52.797
MAKE IT SOUND BUT IT IT DOESN'T

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:53.865
JUST SAY THAT WE TAKE THEIR

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:55.033
COSTS AND THEN WE JUST BUILD

02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:57.568
INTO THE RATE THERE ARE WAYS IN

02:22:57.635 --> 02:22:59.037
WHICH WE EITHER SMOOTHS THE DATA.

02:22:59.103 --> 02:23:00.805
TREND IT OR WE LOOK AT IT IN

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:03.675
COMPARISON TO OTHER DATA THAT WE

02:23:03.741 --> 02:23:05.877
HAVE TO SEE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE.

02:23:05.944 --> 02:23:06.477
SO I GUESS THAT WITH THAT WITH

02:23:06.544 --> 02:23:07.312
THAT STARTED ME THINKING ABOUT

02:23:07.378 --> 02:23:09.547
IS THAT -- OBVIOUSLY THE FEE FOR

02:23:09.614 --> 02:23:11.883
SERVICE PORTION OF THE

02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:13.284
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AROUND.

02:23:13.351 --> 02:23:15.553
MEDI CAL IS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:17.755
THAT IS SMALLER NOW THAN IT WAS

02:23:17.822 --> 02:23:19.257
IN AND GETTING SMALLER GETTING

02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:21.225
SMALLER SO KNOWING THAT WE NEED

02:23:21.292 --> 02:23:22.560
MORE PROVIDERS OUT THERE AND

02:23:22.627 --> 02:23:23.828
THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE AND THAT

02:23:23.895 --> 02:23:26.097
FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT THAT

02:23:26.164 --> 02:23:27.298
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO IT.

02:23:27.365 --> 02:23:28.900
BUT WE HAVEN'T RESTORED EVEN THE

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:31.269
10% CUTS.

02:23:31.336 --> 02:23:34.072
AND AND IN YET THAT THERE ARE

02:23:34.138 --> 02:23:35.473
PROVIDERS WITH THE MESSAGE THE

02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:36.841
MANAGED CARE SYSTEMS THAT ARE

02:23:36.908 --> 02:23:38.643
GETTING MORE MONEY IF I'M A FEE

02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:39.911
FOR SERVICE PROVIDER OUT THERE.

02:23:39.978 --> 02:23:41.612
AND I'M LIVING UNDER THE 10%

02:23:41.679 --> 02:23:43.147
CUTS THAT HAPPENED AND WE'RE IN

02:23:43.214 --> 02:23:45.783
A ROBUST ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'VE

02:23:45.850 --> 02:23:47.151
GOT RESERVES.

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:49.053
AND OTHER PROVIDERS ARE GETTING

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:50.455
MORE AND AYE I WANT TO BE ABLE

02:23:50.521 --> 02:23:51.956
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE BUT I'M

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:56.194
pERA.

02:23:56.260 --> 02:24:00.064
FEES WHY ARE WE NOT USING

02:24:00.131 --> 02:24:01.499
RESOURCE SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES.

02:24:01.566 --> 02:24:05.236
OR ARE WE RELY SOLELY ON PROPS

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:06.471
FIFTY SIX TO HELP WITH THE

02:24:06.537 --> 02:24:07.372
PROVIDER INCREASES WHY.

02:24:07.438 --> 02:24:08.506
WOULD THOSE SHOULD BE

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:09.974
ENHANCEMENTS ON TOP IN MY

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:13.344
OPINION ENHANCEMENTS ON TOP OF

02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:15.580
THE RESTORATION OF THE RATES

02:24:15.646 --> 02:24:17.248
THAT WERE CUT.

02:24:17.315 --> 02:24:18.383
SO.

02:24:18.449 --> 02:24:19.817
WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE BIG

02:24:19.884 --> 02:24:21.452
TICKET ITEMS THAT WERE WE'RE

02:24:21.519 --> 02:24:23.421
LOOKING AT IN OUR BUDGET GOING

02:24:23.488 --> 02:24:25.957
FORWARD THIS IS NOT PARTICULARLY

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:27.859
HUGE AND SOME OF THE BIG ONES?

02:24:27.925 --> 02:24:30.395
SO IS THE DEPARTMENT.

02:24:30.461 --> 02:24:34.499
OPEN TO THAT OR IS THIS IS THIS.

02:24:34.565 --> 02:24:36.467
OR FOR IS THAT FEE FOR SERVICE

02:24:36.534 --> 02:24:38.269
MODEL THAT'S THAT'S GRADUALLY

02:24:38.336 --> 02:24:39.804
DWINDLING.

02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:42.106
DESTINED TO NOT BE SUPPORTED AND

02:24:42.173 --> 02:24:44.308
AND GO AWAY ALL TOGETHER YEAH --

02:24:44.375 --> 02:24:46.110
SO COUPLE THINGS -- SO WE WILL

02:24:46.177 --> 02:24:47.712
ALWAYS HAVE TO MAINTAIN A FEE

02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:51.182
FOR SERVICE SYSTEM IN THE STATE --

02:24:51.249 --> 02:24:53.484
DUAL ELIGIBLES -- IT USE IT TO

02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:54.552
THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:24:54.619 --> 02:24:57.522
ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE --

02:24:57.588 --> 02:25:00.291
UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS FOR

02:25:00.358 --> 02:25:02.193
LIMITED SCOPE SERVICES I'M WE

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:03.394
HAVE CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAT

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:04.829
ARE EXEMPT FROM MANAGED CARE

02:25:04.896 --> 02:25:06.798
FOSTER KIDS FOR EXAMPLE -- AND

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.299
THEN INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:25:08.366 --> 02:25:10.168
FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID BUT

02:25:10.234 --> 02:25:12.036
ARE IN THE CHOICE PERIOD FOR

02:25:12.103 --> 02:25:13.771
MANAGED CARE'S PLAN SELECTION

02:25:13.838 --> 02:25:14.839
THERE IN ROLLED IN FEE FOR

02:25:14.906 --> 02:25:15.807
SERVICE WILL THEY MAKE THEIR

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:17.241
PLAN CHOICE SO.

02:25:17.308 --> 02:25:18.943
WE WILL NEVER GET RID OF FEE FOR

02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:20.978
SERVICE IT WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE

02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:23.881
TO EXIST -- TO THE EXTENT THAT --

02:25:23.948 --> 02:25:25.249
SO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:25:25.316 --> 02:25:27.452
NOT PROPOSED -- AB NINETY SEVEN

02:25:27.518 --> 02:25:29.420
RESTORATION THE PHYSICIAN SIDE I

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:30.788
THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:31.756
LEGISLATURE AND THE

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:33.057
ADMINISTRATION THROUGH BUDGET

02:25:33.124 --> 02:25:34.459
NEGOTIATIONS WHICH OBVIOUSLY

02:25:34.525 --> 02:25:35.426
WILL PROBABLY.

02:25:35.493 --> 02:25:38.062
COMMENCE MORE -- AFTER THE MAY

02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:40.364
REVISION -- THAT WOULD BE A

02:25:40.431 --> 02:25:41.899
CHOICE BETWEEN THE THE

02:25:41.966 --> 02:25:44.368
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:25:44.435 --> 02:25:45.603
LEGISLATURE AS TO WHETHER THAT

02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:46.838
WAS A PRIORITY.

02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:47.972
RESTORATION THAT THEY WANTED TO

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:50.875
MAKE IN LIGHT OF OTHER YOU KNOW

02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:52.110
SIGNIFICANT.

02:25:52.176 --> 02:25:53.711
FISCAL CHOICES THAT THEY WOULD

02:25:53.778 --> 02:25:55.446
OTHERWISE WANT TO SPEAK TO HAVE

02:25:55.513 --> 02:25:57.648
THAT MANY USE.

02:25:57.715 --> 02:25:58.649
FOR I GUESS I JUST WONDER FOR

02:25:58.716 --> 02:26:00.017
GOING BACK TO YOU EXPAND

02:26:00.084 --> 02:26:02.420
COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE YES EXPECT

02:26:02.487 --> 02:26:04.288
THE FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL TO

02:26:04.355 --> 02:26:05.890
HAVE THE SAME RATES.

02:26:05.957 --> 02:26:07.725
I'M NOT SURE HOW WE'RE GOOD EVER

02:26:07.792 --> 02:26:09.193
GOING TO HAVE THE PROVIDERS TO

02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:11.062
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WHAT WE NEED

02:26:11.129 --> 02:26:12.130
IF WE CAN'T ADEQUATELY

02:26:12.196 --> 02:26:13.698
REIMBURSED PEOPLE YES THAT'S

02:26:13.764 --> 02:26:14.999
THAT'S REALLY THE AND I THINK A

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:16.400
LOT OF THE FEE FOR SERVICE

02:26:16.467 --> 02:26:17.702
PROVIDERS TO BE HONEST.

02:26:17.768 --> 02:26:18.870
SERVE BOTH WORLDS THEY'RE

02:26:18.936 --> 02:26:19.737
SERVING FEE FOR SERVICE AND

02:26:19.804 --> 02:26:21.139
THEY'RE ALSO CONTRACTED WITH

02:26:21.205 --> 02:26:22.607
WITH MANAGED CARE SO THEY'VE GOT

02:26:22.673 --> 02:26:23.674
THEY'VE GOT AREAS IN WHICH THERE

02:26:23.741 --> 02:26:27.545
STRADDLING BOTH DELIVERY SYSTEMS

02:26:27.612 --> 02:26:28.212
A LOT BUT NOT ALL.

DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS EARLY ON

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:05.676
PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS IS A

02:28:05.743 --> 02:28:07.178
FOUNDATIONAL PART OF THE FEDERAL

02:28:07.245 --> 02:28:08.546
MEDICAID BENEFIT PACKAGE THAT

02:28:08.613 --> 02:28:09.880

DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT BENEFIT.

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:16.320
THE EPS ET BENEFIT IS -- IS AN

02:28:16.387 --> 02:28:18.055
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL PART OF THE

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:19.323
SERVICES THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS

02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:20.691
AGREED TO DELIVER WHEN THEY

02:28:20.758 --> 02:28:22.059
SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH DH CS AND

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:23.461

02:28:23.527 --> 02:28:24.462
PAYMENT RATES.

02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:26.197
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PREVENTIVE

02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:27.999
CARE FOR KIDS IS A KEY PART OF

02:28:28.065 --> 02:28:28.699
WHAT KIDS NEED TO THRIVE

02:28:28.766 --> 02:28:30.368
THROUGHOUT CHILDHOOD AND GROW UP

02:28:30.434 --> 02:28:31.535
TO BE HEALTHY ADULTS.

02:28:31.602 --> 02:28:32.903
I'M HEALTHY ADULTS ARE NOT A

02:28:32.970 --> 02:28:33.804
SURPRISE WE CREATE THEM EVERY

02:28:33.871 --> 02:28:35.973
DAY WHEN WE FAIL TO DELIVER

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:37.141
PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS.

02:28:37.208 --> 02:28:39.076
IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE TO LET

02:28:39.143 --> 02:28:39.677
CHILDREN CONTINUE TO BEAR THE

02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:40.211
COST.

02:28:40.278 --> 02:28:41.646
OF THE SYSTEMIC FAILURES OF THE

02:28:41.712 --> 02:28:43.014
MEDICAL PROGRAM THEY'RE

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.315
HAPPENING AT EVERY LEVEL.

02:28:44.382 --> 02:28:45.683
KIDS MUST BE MADE A PRIORITY

02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:46.984
MEDI CAL BECAUSE PREVENTIVE CARE

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:51.856
SO IMPORTANT AND HAS LASTING

02:28:51.922 --> 02:28:53.190
IMPACTS INTO THEIR ADULTHOOD.

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:54.225
BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CHILDREN

02:28:54.292 --> 02:28:54.992
NOW IN OUR PARTNERS AT THE FIRST

02:28:55.059 --> 02:28:55.793
FIVE ASSOCIATION FIRST START

02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:57.261
ENQUIRING ABOUT MEDI CAL

02:28:57.328 --> 02:28:58.062
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING RATES IN

02:28:58.129 --> 02:28:59.697
EARNEST WE DIDN'T THINK BACK

02:28:59.764 --> 02:29:01.098
THEN THAT IT WOULD BE SUCH A

02:29:01.165 --> 02:29:02.266
LONG AND TROUBLING WROTE.

02:29:02.333 --> 02:29:03.501
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS

02:29:03.567 --> 02:29:04.602
LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED

02:29:04.669 --> 02:29:06.037
A RESOLUTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:29:06.103 --> 02:29:06.871
STONE.

02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:08.039
THAT'S A CLEAR CHILDREN'S

02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:09.040
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS

02:29:09.106 --> 02:29:10.541
REFERRAL AND EARLY INTERVENTION

02:29:10.608 --> 02:29:12.310
AS A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE.

02:29:12.376 --> 02:29:13.844
AND YET AS A PROGRAM MEDICAL WAS

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:15.613
NOT RESPONSIVE AND WAS IN FACT

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:17.415
UNDER DELIVERING ON THE SCREEN

02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:19.150
EVEN THOUGH POLICY DICTATED THAT

02:29:19.216 --> 02:29:20.751
SCREENING SHOULD BE HAPPENING.

02:29:20.818 --> 02:29:22.486
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE EXTERNAL

02:29:22.553 --> 02:29:24.088
QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION EACH

02:29:24.155 --> 02:29:25.589
EURO RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENTAL

02:29:25.656 --> 02:29:27.358
SCREENS BE ADDED AS A MEDICAL

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:28.993
QUALITY MEASURE BUT THE STATE

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:30.461
AGAIN DID NOT TAKE ACTION.

02:29:30.528 --> 02:29:31.862
THE STATE HAS A DUTY TO ENSURE

02:29:31.929 --> 02:29:32.663
THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE THE

02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:33.464
PREVENTIVE CARE THAT THEY'RE

02:29:33.531 --> 02:29:35.166
ENTITLED TO THE EPS THE TEAM

02:29:35.232 --> 02:29:36.734
TITLE IS MORE THAN A REQUIREMENT

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:38.269
TO COVER AND PAY FOR SERVICES.

02:29:38.336 --> 02:29:39.337
BUT RATHER AN AFFIRMATIVE

02:29:39.403 --> 02:29:40.771
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROMOTE

02:29:40.838 --> 02:29:43.074
EDUCATE AND SURE CHILDREN ARE

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:44.742
RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES.

02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:46.077
SO FIRST MEASUREMENT IT'S

02:29:46.143 --> 02:29:47.144
COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHAT

02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:48.813
GETS MEASURED MATTERS AND IN

02:29:48.879 --> 02:29:49.914
FACT AUDITOR'S INVESTIGATION

02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:51.482
SHOWS THAT UTILIZATION RATES

02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:52.283
WERE HIGHER FOR SERVICES WERE

02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:52.516
THERE.

02:29:52.583 --> 02:29:53.718
WHERE WHERE THERE WERE

02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:56.153
PERFORMANCE MEASURES -- RATHER

02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:56.821
THAN FOR SERVICES THAT THEY WERE

02:29:56.887 --> 02:29:57.221
NOT.

02:29:57.288 --> 02:29:58.756
SO THE STATE MUST SEND A SIGNAL

02:29:58.823 --> 02:29:59.924
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF YOU PST

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:01.225
PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR KIDS BY

02:30:01.292 --> 02:30:03.127
ROUTINELY AND ROBUSTLY TRACKING

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:04.095
IT ALONG THE WAY.

02:30:04.161 --> 02:30:05.062
DATE ON PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:06.364
IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING IN

02:30:06.430 --> 02:30:08.099
ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES

02:30:08.165 --> 02:30:08.699
THAT WE KNOW EXISTING SERVICE

02:30:08.766 --> 02:30:10.234
DELIVERY AND THAT COULD BE

02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:11.502
EXACERBATED WITHOUT.

02:30:11.569 --> 02:30:13.904
CONCERTED INTENTIONAL EFFORTS TO

02:30:13.971 --> 02:30:15.039
ADDRESS THEM.

02:30:15.106 --> 02:30:15.573
RELATED TO MEASUREMENT IS

02:30:15.639 --> 02:30:16.540
ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:30:16.607 --> 02:30:17.575
THE STEPS TO TEACH YES HAS

02:30:17.641 --> 02:30:18.376
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AROUND THE

02:30:18.442 --> 02:30:19.310
QUALITY MEASURES AND

02:30:19.377 --> 02:30:20.378
ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS ARE AN

02:30:20.444 --> 02:30:21.445
EXCELLENT FIRST STEP TO

02:30:21.512 --> 02:30:22.813
AMELIORATE SOME OF THE

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.215
LONGSTANDING DEFICIENCIES AND

02:30:24.281 --> 02:30:25.616
DATA AND OVERSIGHT.

02:30:25.683 --> 02:30:27.485
THE STEPS ARE CLEARLY A PART OF

02:30:27.551 --> 02:30:29.086
GOVERNOR NUISANCE PARTY FOCUS ON

02:30:29.153 --> 02:30:30.554
EARLY CHILDHOOD AND ARE

02:30:30.621 --> 02:30:32.256
SUPPORTED BY THE PROPOSED BUDGET

02:30:32.323 --> 02:30:32.890
INVESTMENT IN MEDICAL PROVIDER

02:30:32.957 --> 02:30:34.058
RATES.

02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:35.259
HOWEVER THESE EFFORTS WELL

02:30:35.326 --> 02:30:36.994
SIGNIFICANT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT

02:30:37.061 --> 02:30:38.396
TO INCREASE CHILDREN'S RECEIPT

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:40.264
OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES.

02:30:40.331 --> 02:30:42.366
AS NOTED IN READING YESTERDAY BY

02:30:42.433 --> 02:30:42.900
THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

02:30:42.967 --> 02:30:43.768
FOUNDATION.

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:45.269
MEDICAL MANAGED CARE OVERSIGHT

02:30:45.336 --> 02:30:46.904
SHOULD MOVE BEYOND COMPLIANCE

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:47.705
INTO EXCELLENCE AROUND

02:30:47.772 --> 02:30:50.508
CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

02:30:50.574 --> 02:30:51.342
CARE.

02:30:51.409 --> 02:30:52.076
IN ADDITION TO ESTABLISHING A

02:30:52.143 --> 02:30:53.978
QUALITY STRATEGY OR GENDER FOR

02:30:54.044 --> 02:30:54.478
KIDS.

02:30:54.545 --> 02:30:54.979
THE STATE COULD BETTER

02:30:55.045 --> 02:30:56.480
CLARIFYING GUIDANCE IN CONTRACT

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:57.615
THE SPECIFIC EPS D. T.

02:30:57.681 --> 02:30:58.716
REQUIREMENTS THAT HEALTH PLANS

02:30:58.783 --> 02:31:00.217
ARE DELEGATED TO PROVIDE.

02:31:00.284 --> 02:31:02.953
AND TIE THEM TO SPECIFIC QUALITY

02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:04.121
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.

02:31:04.188 --> 02:31:05.556
NOTABLY THE STATE HAS AN

02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:07.091
UPCOMING OPPORTUNITY TO MORE

02:31:07.158 --> 02:31:08.859
STRONGLY OUTLINED THE EPS D. T. --

02:31:08.926 --> 02:31:10.528
ENTIRELY SPECIFICATIONS IN

02:31:10.594 --> 02:31:11.929
CONTRACTS AS MEDICAL IS

02:31:11.996 --> 02:31:14.498
INITIATING THE RIVER FROM A

02:31:14.565 --> 02:31:15.900
PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE NEXT YEAR.

02:31:15.966 --> 02:31:17.601
AND FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:31:17.668 --> 02:31:18.669
OUR REGION EDUCATION.

02:31:18.736 --> 02:31:20.471
SO AS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER MORE

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:21.338
NEEDS TO BE DONE TO CLEARLY

02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:22.773
COMMUNICATE TO FAMILIES AND

02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:24.074
PROVIDERS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

02:31:24.141 --> 02:31:25.676
OF AND RULES AROUND PREVENTIVE

02:31:25.743 --> 02:31:27.044
CARE AND IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY

02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:29.280
BOTH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

02:31:29.346 --> 02:31:31.348
SERICES AND BY HEALTH PLANS.

02:31:31.415 --> 02:31:32.850
SO ASSUMING THAT PROVIDER

02:31:32.917 --> 02:31:33.751
NETWORKS ARE ADEQUATE AND

02:31:33.818 --> 02:31:34.919
THEY'RE NOT UNREASONABLE TRAVEL

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:36.353
TIMES ARE DISTANCES.

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:37.421
AND IF PROVIDER DIRECTORIES ARE

02:31:37.488 --> 02:31:39.457
UPDATED ENOUGH WHERE A PARENT

02:31:39.523 --> 02:31:40.224
CAN EASILY IDENTIFY NEARBY

02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:41.692
PROVIDER THAT WILL MEET THEIR

02:31:41.759 --> 02:31:42.593
CHILD'S NEEDS.

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:43.727

02:37:11.588 --> 02:37:14.691
RECENT -- EXPERIENCE WITH THAT --

02:37:14.758 --> 02:37:16.093
AND IN ADDITION I THINK THE LAST

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.494
THING IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT

02:37:17.561 --> 02:37:19.830
THERE ARE SOME BUILDING IN OF

02:37:19.897 --> 02:37:21.965
SOME PROGRESS AND INTERIM

02:37:22.032 --> 02:37:23.333
PROCESS POINTS RIGHT SO THERE'S

02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:24.635
AN OVERALL OUTCOME OF COURSE

02:37:24.701 --> 02:37:25.602
THAT YOU WANT.

02:37:25.669 --> 02:37:27.304
OF A QUALITY LEVEL OF THAT

02:37:27.371 --> 02:37:28.872
YOU'RE REACHED ACROSS THE STATE

02:37:28.939 --> 02:37:30.307
FOR ALL FOR ALL CHILDREN

02:37:30.374 --> 02:37:32.276
BENEFICIARIES BUT OF COURSE

02:37:32.342 --> 02:37:33.110
THERE ARE.

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:34.511
THERE ARE POINTS IN BETWEEN THAT

02:37:34.578 --> 02:37:35.712
YOU THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY HIT AS

02:37:35.779 --> 02:37:36.747
WELL TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE MAKING

02:37:36.814 --> 02:37:38.115
SOME PROGRESS TO WEAR THAT

02:37:38.182 --> 02:37:39.449
OVERALL OUTCOME.

02:37:39.516 --> 02:37:42.820
AND US HAVING ACTUALLY DONE THAT

02:37:42.886 --> 02:37:44.254
AND IN IN OUR INTERACTION WITH

02:37:44.321 --> 02:37:45.923
THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WE WE

02:37:45.989 --> 02:37:46.890
TOOK.

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:48.892
OUR QUALITY LEVEL FROM THE YOU

02:37:48.959 --> 02:37:51.328
KNOW HITTING A 54% LEVEL TO A

02:37:51.395 --> 02:37:52.296
94% LEVEL FOR MINIMUM

02:37:52.362 --> 02:37:53.797
PERFORMANCE LEVEL WITHIN A FEW

02:37:53.864 --> 02:37:55.332
YEARS BUT INCREMENTALLY YOU

02:37:55.399 --> 02:37:56.767
COULD SEE OVER EACH YEAR WE

02:37:56.834 --> 02:37:58.135
REPORTED IN HOW THE IMPROVED

02:37:58.202 --> 02:38:00.204
OVER TIME -- AND HOW THAT

02:38:00.270 --> 02:38:00.871
REFLECTED THEN THE

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:02.573
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT I WAS

02:38:02.639 --> 02:38:03.273
TO DISCUSS.

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:04.341
SO I THINK THAT OF BUILDING IN

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:05.409
SOME OF THOSE THINGS WOULD ALSO

02:38:05.475 --> 02:38:06.643
LEAD TO A REALLY HELPFUL

02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:07.878
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PLAN

02:38:07.945 --> 02:38:09.847
ACTUALLY EXECUTING WHAT IS THE

02:38:09.913 --> 02:38:11.882
STATE IS IS PUTTING IN -- AT

02:38:11.949 --> 02:38:13.717
THIS POINT -- I DO HAVE A FEW

02:38:13.784 --> 02:38:15.419
EXAMPLES OF SORT OF OTHER THINGS

02:38:15.485 --> 02:38:17.387
THAT WE LEARNED -- TO WHILE WE

02:38:17.454 --> 02:38:18.155
WERE DOING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:38:18.222 --> 02:38:20.123
BUILT -- THAT ARE MORE CONCRETE

02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:22.526
EXAMPLES SUCH AS CLINIC DAYS

02:38:22.593 --> 02:38:27.064
THOSE THOSE -- ENTITLED SOME

02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:28.298
PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR BETTER

02:38:28.365 --> 02:38:29.766
QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS -- AND

02:38:29.833 --> 02:38:31.735
WE WENT FROM HAVING YOU KNOW A

02:38:31.802 --> 02:38:33.937
FEW A YEAR AND THAT VERY FIRST

02:38:34.004 --> 02:38:35.305
YEAR -- THAT WE WERE

02:38:35.372 --> 02:38:36.940
IMPLEMENTING INTO LAST YEAR

02:38:37.007 --> 02:38:39.443
HAVING YOU KNOW OVER FIFTY AND A

02:38:39.509 --> 02:38:40.043
LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS

02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:42.613
WITH A LOT OF FQHCS IN ORDER TO

02:38:42.679 --> 02:38:45.249
AGAINST -- INCREASE THE SCARE

02:38:45.315 --> 02:38:46.950
AND AND THE SCOPE AS WELL AND

02:38:47.017 --> 02:38:48.051
AGAIN THOSE ARE JUST THINGS THAT

02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:49.486
DEVELOP OVER TIME BUT ONCE YOU

02:38:49.553 --> 02:38:50.520
STARTED AND YOU GET A GOOD

02:38:50.587 --> 02:38:52.389
TEMPLATE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SCALE

02:38:52.456 --> 02:38:53.023
IT AND ACTUALLY HAVE MUCH MORE

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:54.024
IMPACT.

02:38:54.091 --> 02:38:54.925
IN ADDITION I TALKED ABOUT OUR

02:38:54.992 --> 02:38:56.326
PRACTICE CONSULTANTS WE STARTED

02:38:56.393 --> 02:38:58.095
OUT WITH A FEW WE HAVE MANY MORE

02:38:58.161 --> 02:38:59.196
OVER THE STATE AS WELL THAT ARE

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:00.764
WALKING PRACTICES THROUGH

02:39:00.831 --> 02:39:01.698
EXACTLY HOW TO REACH THESE

02:39:01.765 --> 02:39:03.634
METRICS HAD ACCOUNT FOR THEM AND

02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:04.968
HOW TO DELIVER THAT HERE.

02:39:05.035 --> 02:39:07.437
ON ALL KINDS OF EDUCATION POINTS

02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:09.406
AND THEN ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE GOT

02:39:09.473 --> 02:39:10.807
TO PUT THOSE TOGETHER OVER TIME

02:39:10.874 --> 02:39:12.309
WE SAW A SYNERGISTIC EFFECT.

02:39:12.376 --> 02:39:13.343
BECAUSE WE BUILD THOSE

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:14.811
RELATIONSHIPS AND ACTUALLY

02:39:14.878 --> 02:39:16.613
ENACTED EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING IN

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:19.049
THOSE AREAS -- WE SAW PEOPLE

02:39:19.116 --> 02:39:21.551
ASKING US TO THEN PARTNER ASKING

02:39:21.618 --> 02:39:23.587
US TO DO IN A INNOVATIVE PROGRAM

02:39:23.654 --> 02:39:25.289
THAT ALSO THEN -- GAVE A BOOST

02:39:25.355 --> 02:39:26.323
TO THE OVERALL QUALITY

02:39:26.390 --> 02:39:28.125
PERFORMANCE THAT WE HAD --

02:39:28.191 --> 02:39:30.394
ACROSS THE WHOLE NETWORK AND SO

02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:32.462
IT JUST THINK -- HAVING AN IN AN

02:39:32.529 --> 02:39:33.463
INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE

02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:34.998
NEEDS AND HAVING ACTED THEM JUST

02:39:35.065 --> 02:39:37.267
RECENTLY -- AND SHOWN REALLY

02:39:37.334 --> 02:39:38.902
GREAT OUTCOMES JUST USING SOME

02:39:38.969 --> 02:39:40.504
OF THOSE LESSONS LEARNED TO SAY

02:39:40.570 --> 02:39:42.139
HOW WE WOULD ACTUALLY ALSO APPLY

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:43.206
THOSE TO THE NEW METRICS THAT

02:39:43.273 --> 02:39:45.475
ARE FAIRLY COMING IN -- AND

02:39:45.542 --> 02:39:47.277
BEING INTRODUCED -- TO BALANCE

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:48.845
OUT AS WELL -- WHAT WE'RE

02:39:48.912 --> 02:39:52.049
MEASURING FOR CHILDREN ACROSS

02:39:52.115 --> 02:39:56.653
THE NETWORK?

ORGANIZE HEALTH SYSTEM.

02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.164
THAT SERVES SANTA BARBARA AND

02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:07.831
SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTIES AND WE

02:40:07.898 --> 02:40:10.801
HAVE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

02:40:10.867 --> 02:40:11.401
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEDI CAL

02:40:11.468 --> 02:40:12.803
RECIPIENTS.

02:40:12.869 --> 02:40:14.004
SO I'M HERE TODAY NOT ONLY ON

02:40:14.071 --> 02:40:14.871
BEHALF OF SOME CALVET ALSO THE

02:40:14.938 --> 02:40:16.340
LOCAL HEALTH PLANS A CALIFORNIA

02:40:16.406 --> 02:40:18.976
WHICH IS THE ASSOCIATION OF THE

02:40:19.042 --> 02:40:19.509
SIXTEEN PUBLICLY SPONSORED

02:40:19.576 --> 02:40:20.577
HEALTH PLANS.

02:40:20.644 --> 02:40:23.613
THAT -- CIRCA MEDI CAL

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:25.682
POPULATION.

02:40:25.749 --> 02:40:26.316
AND WHEN THIS REPORT CAME OUT I

02:40:26.383 --> 02:40:27.317
THINK I SPEAK SPEAK FOR THE OUR

02:40:27.384 --> 02:40:27.918
ENTIRE ASSOCIATION WITH SO WE

02:40:27.985 --> 02:40:28.485
ALL.

02:40:28.552 --> 02:40:33.156
A REDDIT CLOSELY AND TOOK THE

02:40:33.223 --> 02:40:34.925
CONCLUSIONS SERIOUSLY.

02:40:34.992 --> 02:40:38.295
OBVIOUSLY -- SOME AREAS -- WE

02:40:38.362 --> 02:40:39.997
DID FAIRLY WELL SOME AREAS WE

02:40:40.063 --> 02:40:42.232
DIDN'T AND AND THIS IS A GOOD

02:40:42.299 --> 02:40:45.569
SNAPSHOT FOR US -- TO TO SEE

02:40:45.635 --> 02:40:47.504
EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE AT THIS

02:40:47.571 --> 02:40:48.705
PARTICULAR POINT TIME.

02:40:48.772 --> 02:40:50.107
AND I THINK.

02:40:50.173 --> 02:40:52.009
ALL THE PLANS OF A LOCAL PLANTS

02:40:52.075 --> 02:40:52.909
HAVE ALL ACTION ACTUALLY

02:40:52.976 --> 02:40:54.878
UNDERTAKEN REVIEW OF OKAY WHAT

02:40:54.945 --> 02:40:56.279
ARE WE DOING WELL WHAT ARE WE

02:40:56.346 --> 02:40:58.782
DOING NOT WHAT. TO START MY SO

02:40:58.849 --> 02:40:59.983
WHAT CAN WE DO TO START

02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:02.919
IMPROVING ON AND SOME OF THE

02:41:02.986 --> 02:41:04.554
AREAS WHERE WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T

02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:06.456
SCORE SO WELL.

02:41:06.523 --> 02:41:08.825
AND I THINK WERE -- VERY --

02:41:08.892 --> 02:41:11.395
WILLING AND ANXIOUS TO WORK WITH --

02:41:11.461 --> 02:41:13.296
DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES

02:41:13.363 --> 02:41:16.299
LEGISLATURE OF PEOPLE THIS PANEL --

02:41:16.366 --> 02:41:18.402
TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT

02:41:18.468 --> 02:41:21.805
WHAT EXACTLY ONE ACCOMPLISH AND

02:41:21.872 --> 02:41:22.472
HOW BEST TO ACCOMPLISH IT

02:41:22.539 --> 02:41:22.773
[inaudible]

02:41:22.839 --> 02:41:25.809
AND WHILE A DOCTOR WHILE I WAS

02:41:25.876 --> 02:41:28.245
TALKING ABOUT KIND OF THE

02:41:28.311 --> 02:41:30.480
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND I

02:41:30.547 --> 02:41:31.114
ALWAYS HAS BEEN TOUCHED UPON BUT

02:41:31.181 --> 02:41:32.649
I A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY'S

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:35.085
ALSO BEEN ON THE ACCESS TO

02:41:35.152 --> 02:41:36.620
PROVIDERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS.

02:41:36.686 --> 02:41:39.122
AND I THINK IN OUR SIXTEEN

02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:40.757
HEALTH PLANS THERE IS A VAST

02:41:40.824 --> 02:41:42.292
DIFFERENCE IN THE CHALLENGES WE

02:41:42.359 --> 02:41:44.528
MAY FACE ABOUT BUILDING AND

02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:46.263
MAINTAINING PROVIDER NETWORKS --

02:41:46.329 --> 02:41:47.831
THE CHALLENGES THAT.

02:41:47.898 --> 02:41:49.199
WE MAY HAVE IN SANTA BARBARA SAN

02:41:49.266 --> 02:41:51.134
LUIS OBISPO ARE NOT THE SAME

02:41:51.201 --> 02:41:54.438
THAT WOULD BE -- IN MOST URBAN

02:41:54.504 --> 02:41:56.406
AREAS.

02:41:56.473 --> 02:41:59.376
AND I THINK THIS IS BEN -- ALSO

02:41:59.443 --> 02:41:59.943
TOUCHED UPON.

02:42:00.010 --> 02:42:00.777
FIRST FOR OUR EXAMPLE OUR

02:42:00.844 --> 02:42:02.312
SERVICE AREA WE HAVE A HANDFUL

02:42:02.379 --> 02:42:03.980
OF SMALL CITIES AND GREAT

02:42:04.047 --> 02:42:05.782
DISTANCES BETWEEN THEM.

02:42:05.849 --> 02:42:07.217
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR RURAL

02:42:07.284 --> 02:42:09.519
AREAS SO ARE CHALLENGES WITH THE

02:42:09.586 --> 02:42:11.521
PROVIDER NETWORK REALLY REVOLVE

02:42:11.588 --> 02:42:14.091
AROUND THE LACK OF PROVIDERS NOT

02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:15.926
WHETHER THEIR CONTRACTOR NOT WE

02:42:15.992 --> 02:42:17.761
ACTUALLY CONTRACT WITH THE VAST

02:42:17.828 --> 02:42:19.729
MAJORITY OF ALL LICENSED

02:42:19.796 --> 02:42:21.731
PHYSICIANS IN OUR SERVICE AREA.

02:42:21.798 --> 02:42:22.332
BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT WE STILL

02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:24.668
HAVE TO SUBMIT SIXTY SEVEN OF

02:42:24.734 --> 02:42:27.704
THE ALTERNATE ACCESS --

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:28.972
STANDARDS.

02:42:29.039 --> 02:42:31.441
AND THEY WERE ALL DUE TO EITHER

02:42:31.508 --> 02:42:32.976
A SIMPLE LACK OF PROVIDERS HAVE

02:42:33.043 --> 02:42:35.112
A COUPLE EXAMPLES -- PEDIATRIC

02:42:35.178 --> 02:42:36.179
ENDOCRINOLOGY PEDIATRIC

02:42:36.246 --> 02:42:37.881
CARDIOLOGY THERE AREN'T ANY OF

02:42:37.948 --> 02:42:38.849
THOSE AND SO MOST BASEBALL

02:42:38.915 --> 02:42:40.484
COUNTY SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO

02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:41.618
TO SANTA BARBARA COUNTY.

02:42:41.685 --> 02:42:44.921
OR PERHAPS MEMBERS THAT LIVE IN

02:42:44.988 --> 02:42:46.590
REMOTE AREAS OR NO THERE ARE NO

02:42:46.656 --> 02:42:48.792
POSITIONS OR FACILITIES

02:42:48.859 --> 02:42:50.093
HOSPITALS NEARBY.

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:52.562
WHEN WE DO RUN INTO?

02:42:52.629 --> 02:42:55.765
ISSUES WITH PROVIDERS --

02:42:55.832 --> 02:42:57.200
ESPECIALLY -- THAT.

02:42:57.267 --> 02:42:59.169
THEIR SKILLS ARE IN HIGH DEMAND

02:42:59.236 --> 02:43:02.305
WE HAVE NEGOTIATED HIGHER RATES --

02:43:02.372 --> 02:43:04.141
AS NEEDED -- TO YOU KNOW

02:43:04.207 --> 02:43:05.542
RESPONSE TO THE MARKET AND WE'VE

02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:06.877
BEEN OTHERWISE IT'S CREATIVE AND

02:43:06.943 --> 02:43:08.979
FLEXIBLE AS WE CAN TO MAKE SURE

02:43:09.045 --> 02:43:10.580
THAT.

02:43:10.647 --> 02:43:13.517
WE HAVE IS FOR COMPREHENSIVE A

02:43:13.583 --> 02:43:15.585
PROVIDER NETWORK IS LOCALLY AS

02:43:15.652 --> 02:43:19.189
POSSIBLE -- AGAIN IN.

02:43:19.256 --> 02:43:22.492
IN OUR SIXTY SEVEN CASES --

02:43:22.559 --> 02:43:24.227
THERE WAS JUST THERE IS JUST NO

02:43:24.294 --> 02:43:24.828
NONE OF THESE PROVIDERS IN THE

02:43:24.895 --> 02:43:26.796
AREA.

02:43:26.863 --> 02:43:28.231
AND MY EXPECTATION IS WE'VE

02:43:28.298 --> 02:43:29.599
TALKED ABOUT TO CENTER VALLEY

02:43:29.666 --> 02:43:31.234
TALK ABOUT NORTH OF SACRAMENTO

02:43:31.301 --> 02:43:34.304
THOSE ARE THE AREAS -- AND SO I

02:43:34.371 --> 02:43:35.405
THINK IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:37.741
SOLUTIONS. TO THAT WE HAVE TO

02:50:01.624 --> 02:50:02.559
IMPORTANT WORK.

02:50:02.625 --> 02:50:03.426
CALIFORNIA STANDING NEAR THE

PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES TO A

02:50:07.597 --> 02:50:09.232
POPULATION THAT COMPRISES OVER

02:50:09.299 --> 02:50:11.401
HALF THE CHILDREN THE STATE.

02:50:11.467 --> 02:50:12.569
WHICH IS FLATLY UNACCEPTABLE.

02:50:12.635 --> 02:50:13.870
PREVENTIVE CARE INCLUDING WELL

02:50:13.937 --> 02:50:15.672
CHILD VISITS SCREENINGS LIKE

02:50:15.738 --> 02:50:16.773
THOSE THAT CAN PREVENT THE

02:50:16.839 --> 02:50:18.441
TERRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF LEAD

02:50:18.508 --> 02:50:20.343
POISONING IN CHILDREN AN INMATE

02:50:20.410 --> 02:50:21.377
IMMUNIZATIONS ARE THE

02:50:21.444 --> 02:50:22.979
CORNERSTONE OF GOOD HEALTH FOR

02:50:23.046 --> 02:50:24.414
DEVELOPING CHILDREN AND YOUTH.

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:25.982
WE LOOK FOR TO PARTNERING WITH

02:50:26.049 --> 02:50:28.451
THE STATE THE PLANS THE FAMILIES

02:50:28.518 --> 02:50:30.086

ACCESS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE AUDIT

02:50:37.193 --> 02:50:37.994
REPORT.

02:50:38.061 --> 02:50:39.028
WE'VE HEARD TODAY THAT THERE ARE

02:50:39.095 --> 02:50:40.697
MANY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO

02:50:40.763 --> 02:50:42.231
CALIFORNIA'S CLEAR NEED TO

02:50:42.298 --> 02:50:43.333
IMPROVE ITS PROVISION OF

02:50:43.399 --> 02:50:46.903
PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES TO

02:50:46.970 --> 02:50:48.638
CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICARE.

02:50:48.705 --> 02:50:49.138
PERSONS EXPERIENCE THESE

02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:49.672
CHALLENGES EVERY DAY AS WE

02:50:49.739 --> 02:50:50.373
STRIVE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE THAT

02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:51.541
CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWING

02:50:51.608 --> 02:50:53.009
HEALTH OF THIS GREAT STE.

02:50:53.076 --> 02:50:55.411
STATE'S POPULATION WE AGREE THAT

02:50:55.478 --> 02:50:56.446
A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH IS

02:50:56.512 --> 02:50:58.181
NEEDED THEREFORE WE ENDORSE AND

02:50:58.247 --> 02:50:59.315
STRONGLY SUPPORT THE STATEMENT

02:50:59.382 --> 02:51:00.717
MADE MY CHILDREN NOW.

02:51:00.783 --> 02:51:02.418
INCREASED AND MORE TRANSPARENT

02:51:02.485 --> 02:51:04.253
DATA COLLECTION MONITORING

02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:05.788
ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

02:51:05.855 --> 02:51:07.857
OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AS WELL

02:51:07.924 --> 02:51:10.093
AS ENHANCE CARE COORDINATION IN

02:51:10.159 --> 02:51:11.260
THE FORM OF STANDARDIZED

02:51:11.327 --> 02:51:12.795
CLINICAL CARE MEASURES.

02:51:12.862 --> 02:51:14.397
AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE ALL

02:51:14.464 --> 02:51:15.832
ESSENTIAL TO CLOSING CARE GAPS

02:51:15.898 --> 02:51:17.033
THAT ARE EXTREMELY COSTLY TO THE

02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:19.769
STATE AND DETRIMENTAL AND EVEN

02:51:19.836 --> 02:51:21.437
DEVASTATING TO FAMILIES.

02:51:21.504 --> 02:51:22.905
AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PREVENTION

02:51:22.972 --> 02:51:24.574
EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT

02:51:24.641 --> 02:51:26.342
ARE MISSED WONDERFUL RARE

02:51:26.409 --> 02:51:28.111
FACTORS MUST BE ADDRESSED I WILL

02:51:28.177 --> 02:51:29.579
FOCUS BRIEFLY ON THE LACK OF

02:51:29.646 --> 02:51:30.847
ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF PHYSICIANS

02:51:30.913 --> 02:51:32.315
CARING FOR MEDI CAL CHILDREN IN

02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:33.683
BOTH URBAN AND RURAL.

02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:35.351
AREAS IN THE STATE NOT ONLY

02:51:35.418 --> 02:51:36.352
BECAUSE THAT'S MY AREA OF

02:51:36.419 --> 02:51:38.087
EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE AND

02:51:38.154 --> 02:51:39.188
THAT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF

02:51:39.255 --> 02:51:40.490
PEDIATRICS.

02:51:40.556 --> 02:51:41.524
BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS CALLED

02:51:41.591 --> 02:51:42.892
OUT IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT

02:51:42.959 --> 02:51:44.460
LOUDLY AND REPEATEDLY.

02:51:44.527 --> 02:51:45.828
USING TERMS SUCH AS THE KEY

02:51:45.895 --> 02:51:47.196
REASON AND MAJOR COST OF

02:51:47.263 --> 02:51:48.931
CALIFORNIA'S DISMAL STANDING IN

02:51:48.998 --> 02:51:49.966
PROVIDING PREVENTIVE CARE

02:51:50.033 --> 02:51:51.601
SERVICES TO CHILDREN UNDER MEDI

02:51:51.668 --> 02:51:52.135
CAL.

02:51:52.201 --> 02:51:53.536
THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS NOTABLE

02:51:53.603 --> 02:51:55.371
DEFICIENCIES IN BOTH THE NUMBER

02:51:55.438 --> 02:51:56.839
AND LOCATION OF PROVIDERS.

02:51:56.906 --> 02:51:58.408
FORTUNATELY A MAJOR SOLUTION

02:51:58.474 --> 02:51:59.776
PROVIDED IN AUDITOR'S REPORT TO

02:51:59.842 --> 02:52:01.778
POOR PHYSICIAN AVAILABILITY IN

02:52:01.844 --> 02:52:05.415
MEDI CAL IS NOT COMPLICATED IT

02:52:05.481 --> 02:52:06.449
IS CLEAR.

02:52:06.516 --> 02:52:07.283
BY THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THE ONLY

02:52:07.350 --> 02:52:08.151
POLICY TOOL ASSOCIATED WITH AN

02:52:08.217 --> 02:52:09.952
INCREASE IN PROVIDERS ACCEPTING

02:52:10.019 --> 02:52:11.521
MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES AS

02:52:11.587 --> 02:52:12.822
MEDICAID PAYMENT RATES.

02:52:12.889 --> 02:52:14.190
AS STATE MEDICAID RATES

02:52:14.257 --> 02:52:16.392
INCREASED THE PERCENTAGE OF

02:52:16.459 --> 02:52:17.427
PHYSICIANS ACCEPTING MEDICAID

02:52:17.493 --> 02:52:18.795
PATIENTS INCREASE.

02:52:18.861 --> 02:52:20.463
PAYMENT RATES WERE THE ONLY

02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:21.898
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR THAT HAD AN

02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:24.233
IMPACT ON PROVIDE A WILLINGNESS

02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:25.601
TO ACCEPT NEW MEDICAID PATIENTS.

02:52:25.668 --> 02:52:26.836
ME AND SEVERAL OF MY CLOSE

02:52:26.903 --> 02:52:28.104
COLLEAGUES GREATLY ENJOYED

02:52:28.171 --> 02:52:29.405
CARING FOR THESE PATIENTS

02:52:29.472 --> 02:52:31.541
BECAUSE WE CAN MAKE A TRUE AND

02:52:31.607 --> 02:52:33.076
LASTING DIFFERENCE IN THESE

02:52:33.142 --> 02:52:35.378
PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- ESSENTIALLY

02:52:35.445 --> 02:52:37.246
VERY LOW HEALTH LITERACIES BUT

02:52:37.313 --> 02:52:39.949
SOMETIMES AND BASED ON MEDICAL

02:52:40.016 --> 02:52:41.684
SCHOOL DATA AND MYRIAD OF OTHER

02:52:41.751 --> 02:52:43.252
FACTORS WERE UNABLE.

02:52:43.319 --> 02:52:45.755
TO GOING TO A PRACTICE THAT --

02:52:45.822 --> 02:52:47.223
PROVIDES CARE ONLY FOR THEM.

02:52:47.290 --> 02:52:49.158
SO AND THEN ALSO A COMPOUNDING

02:52:49.225 --> 02:52:50.193
FACTOR IS THE LACK OF

02:52:50.259 --> 02:52:51.527
INCOHERENCE TO ACCEPTABLE TIME

02:52:51.594 --> 02:52:52.862
AND DISTANCE STANDARDS AS

02:52:52.929 --> 02:52:54.731
EXHIBITED BY THE OVER AND EIGHTY

02:52:54.797 --> 02:52:55.465
THOUSAND EXCEPTION REQUEST

02:52:55.531 --> 02:52:56.833
SUBMITTED BY MEDI CAL MANAGED

02:52:56.899 --> 02:52:58.234
CARE PLANS.

02:52:58.301 --> 02:52:59.669
WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY DH

02:52:59.736 --> 02:53:01.704
CS APPROVED OVER TEN THOUSAND OF

02:53:01.771 --> 02:53:03.539
THOSE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

02:53:03.606 --> 02:53:04.040
SEVENTEEN IN SOME CASES

02:53:04.107 --> 02:53:05.441
RESULTING IN FAMILIES NEEDING TO

02:53:05.508 --> 02:53:06.909
TRAVEL MANY HOURS.

02:53:06.976 --> 02:53:08.377
AND HUNDREDS OF MILESIN ORDER

02:53:08.444 --> 02:53:10.012
TO SEE AN IN NETWORK PHYSICIAN

02:53:10.079 --> 02:53:11.547
IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT MANY DID

02:53:11.614 --> 02:53:13.149
NOT FOLLOW THROUGH EVEN WHEN

02:53:13.216 --> 02:53:13.916
THEY WERE ABLE TO GET AN

02:53:13.983 --> 02:53:14.684
APPOINTMENT.

02:53:14.751 --> 02:53:16.285
WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL WELL

02:53:16.352 --> 02:53:18.121
CHILD CHECK WERE SUBSTANTIAL

02:53:18.187 --> 02:53:19.622
SUBSPECIALTY APPOINTMENT.

02:53:19.689 --> 02:53:22.391
THIS ACCESS ISSUE IN LIGHT OF

02:53:22.458 --> 02:53:22.992
THE RESURGENCE OF MEASLES AS

02:53:23.059 --> 02:53:24.727
WELL A DEADLY VACCINE

02:53:24.794 --> 02:53:29.432
PREVENTABLE DISEASE -- SHOWS

02:53:29.499 --> 02:53:30.533
JUST -- A LARGE PROBLEM WITH THE

02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:32.201
ACCESS THAT WE'RE FACING SO THE

02:53:32.268 --> 02:53:33.836
PICTURE PAINTED OF LACK OF

02:53:33.903 --> 02:53:34.971
ACCESS TO THE MOST BASIC

02:53:35.037 --> 02:53:36.105
IMPORTANT HERE.

02:53:36.172 --> 02:53:37.406
IS NOT WHEN ANY OF US WOULD WANT

02:53:37.473 --> 02:53:40.176
TO ENTER FOR ANY PERSON'S CHILD

02:53:40.243 --> 02:53:41.944
NIECE NEPHEW OR GRAND CHILD.

02:53:42.011 --> 02:53:43.346
THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PDF OF

02:53:43.412 --> 02:53:45.181
PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA STRONGLY

02:53:45.248 --> 02:53:46.749
URGES THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE

02:53:46.816 --> 02:53:48.284
POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS.

02:53:48.351 --> 02:53:49.585
IN OUR PREVENTIVE CARE NUMBERS

02:53:49.652 --> 02:53:51.187
BY SUPPORTING DH CS AND THE

02:53:51.254 --> 02:53:52.922
PLANS TO ALLOCATION OF STABLE

02:53:52.989 --> 02:53:53.890
FUNDS.

02:53:53.956 --> 02:53:56.425
INCLUDING THE ONES -- FOR LOAN

02:53:56.492 --> 02:53:57.160
REIMBURSEMENT WHICH WOULD

02:53:57.226 --> 02:53:59.562
ENCOURAGE YOUNG PHYSICIANS TO

02:53:59.629 --> 02:54:00.696
CARE FOR THESE PATIENTS

02:54:00.763 --> 02:54:02.598
EXCLUSIVELY AND WHILE THEN

02:54:02.665 --> 02:54:04.100
SUPPORTING THEM AFTER THEY'VE

02:54:04.167 --> 02:54:05.468
PAID OFF THEIR LOANS.

02:54:05.535 --> 02:54:06.736
WHICH WOULD HELP TO MAINTAIN AN

02:54:06.803 --> 02:54:08.371
ADEQUATE PROVIDER NETWORK THAT

02:54:08.437 --> 02:54:09.906
CAN OFFER A TRUE MEDICAL HOME TO

02:54:09.972 --> 02:54:12.175
THESE CHILDREN WHETHER IN PERSON

02:54:12.241 --> 02:54:12.842
OR THROUGH TELEMEDICINE

02:54:12.909 --> 02:54:13.910
INITIATIVE.

02:54:13.976 --> 02:54:16.212
MY COLLEAGUES AND I AND EIGHT P.

TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS

02:54:20.249 --> 02:54:21.784
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PIECES TO

02:54:21.851 --> 02:54:23.019
THE SOLUTION BEING IDENTIFIED

02:54:23.085 --> 02:54:23.920
TODAY.

02:54:23.986 --> 02:54:25.254
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN DESERVE

02:54:25.321 --> 02:54:28.958

YOU HAS HEARD THE TESTIMNY

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:36.365
PREVIOUSLY OF DCH US IN THE

02:54:36.432 --> 02:54:38.901
AUTHORED SEEMS LIKE NOBODY'S IN

02:54:38.968 --> 02:54:40.703
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE AUDIT

02:54:40.770 --> 02:54:41.771
FINDINGS.

02:54:41.838 --> 02:54:43.072
AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

02:54:43.139 --> 02:54:44.674
CAME OUT FROM IT I THINK FROM

02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:45.641
EACH YEAR TESTIMONIES THINK

02:54:45.708 --> 02:54:48.010
YOURS ARE TOUCHING ON DIFFERENT

02:54:48.077 --> 02:54:50.012
ASPECTS.

02:54:50.079 --> 02:54:52.014
OF THAT BUT LET ME JUST ASK.

02:54:52.081 --> 02:54:53.649
WHO COULD DO THIS FAIRLY QUICKLY

02:54:53.716 --> 02:54:56.752
AND JUST KIND OF RUN DOWN --

02:54:56.819 --> 02:54:58.020
READ DOWN THE LINE IS LIKE. FOR

02:54:58.087 --> 02:55:00.990
THE IF YOU CAN ADD A

02:55:05.461 --> 02:55:07.330
STANDARDS.

02:55:07.396 --> 02:55:08.998
AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHAT WOULD

02:55:09.065 --> 02:55:10.933
THAT BE TO HELP GET TO MAKE SURE

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:11.567
THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING CHILDREN

02:55:11.634 --> 02:55:13.836
BEHIND AND IN RECEIVING THESE

02:55:13.903 --> 02:55:17.373
PREVENTIVE SERVICES.

02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:18.574
I COULD JUST SAY BROUGHT BE

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:21.677
LOOKING FOR A BROAD AND STABLE --

02:55:21.744 --> 02:55:23.813
FORM OF FUNDING FOR INCREASED

02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:25.548
FROM THE FUNDING -- FOR

02:55:25.615 --> 02:55:28.784
PROVIDERS WHO WANT CARE FOR MEDI

02:55:28.851 --> 02:55:30.319
CAL PATIENTS.

02:55:30.386 --> 02:55:31.721
LIKE THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT

02:55:31.787 --> 02:55:33.623
RATES WHICH WE GET THROUGH

02:55:33.689 --> 02:55:35.691
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX ARE BUT ON

02:55:35.758 --> 02:55:36.826
TOP OF THAT AS WELL [inaudible]

02:55:36.893 --> 02:55:39.929
YES.

02:55:39.996 --> 02:55:41.264
YOU WERE SPECIFICALLY ASKED

02:55:41.330 --> 02:55:43.900
ABOUT PERFORMANCE MEASURES YES --

02:55:43.966 --> 02:55:45.735
I THINK I THINK THAT THE COURSE

02:55:45.801 --> 02:55:47.470
THAT THAT WERE ADOPTED IS AS A

02:55:47.536 --> 02:55:49.138
MORE ROBUST SET -- IT'S KIND OF

02:55:49.205 --> 02:55:51.040
AN ONGOING DISCUSSION NATIONALLY

02:55:51.107 --> 02:55:52.375
ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT MEASURES

02:55:52.441 --> 02:55:53.309
ARE BUT I THINK TO THE POINT

02:55:53.376 --> 02:55:57.446
THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE MADE HAVING.

02:55:57.513 --> 02:55:58.014
MAKING SURE THAT THEIR SOME

02:55:58.080 --> 02:55:59.448
MINIMUM PERFORMANCE AND THAT

02:55:59.515 --> 02:56:03.019
THERE'S ROOM FOR GROWTH AND THAT --

02:56:03.085 --> 02:56:04.053
THERE'S SORT OF A A PATH TO

02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:05.988
IMPROVEMENT AND SO HAVING SOME

02:56:06.055 --> 02:56:07.356
OF THOSE -- CHECKPOINTS ALONG

02:56:07.423 --> 02:56:09.792
THE WAY -- SO THAT THERE CAN BE

02:56:09.859 --> 02:56:10.626
COURSE CORRECTIONS IF NEEDED

02:56:10.693 --> 02:56:11.994
WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:56:12.061 --> 02:56:14.096
HELPING PLANS DELIVER GOT IT AND

02:56:14.163 --> 02:56:15.564
I THINK WE'RE GONNA LOOK FORWARD.

02:56:15.631 --> 02:56:17.066
TO THAT FROM THE CHS OF THE

02:56:17.133 --> 02:56:18.534
INTERNAL CHECK INS WITH THE

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:19.468
STATE AUDITOR ON THE

02:56:19.535 --> 02:56:21.904
RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED.

02:56:21.971 --> 02:56:22.538
THANK YOU.

02:56:22.605 --> 02:56:22.939
PLEASE.

02:56:23.005 --> 02:56:24.073
I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH AND

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:24.674
THE THINGS THAT ALREADY WERE

02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:26.309
SAID I I DO THINK SPEAKING TO

02:56:26.375 --> 02:56:27.743
RATES MATTER BUT I THINK IT'S

02:56:27.810 --> 02:56:29.779
OVER IT'S THE OVERALL FUNDING IT

02:56:29.845 --> 02:56:31.080
IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS.

02:56:31.147 --> 02:56:32.682
OPPORTUNITY SOME FOR SOME

02:56:32.748 --> 02:56:34.083
FLEXIBILITY TO INCENTIVIZE SOME

02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:35.518
OF THE THINGS THAT.

02:56:35.584 --> 02:56:37.086
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AS MUCH IT

02:56:37.153 --> 02:56:38.921
HERE TOO THAT THAT REQUIRE A

02:56:38.988 --> 02:56:40.356
MORE HERE IT'S AND AND ACTUALLY

02:56:40.423 --> 02:56:41.190
BUILDING IN SOME OF THE

02:56:41.257 --> 02:56:42.425
INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE

02:56:42.491 --> 02:56:43.426
THOSE METRICS ARE.

02:56:43.492 --> 02:56:45.194
FOLLOWED CAPTURED AND REPORTED

02:56:45.261 --> 02:56:46.796
IN -- AND THAT THE AND THAT THE

02:56:46.862 --> 02:56:48.464
PLANTS CAN ACTUALLY PARTNER WITH

02:56:48.531 --> 02:56:49.832
WITH OUR PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO

02:56:49.899 --> 02:56:50.933
DO THAT AND AND WORK WITH THE

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:52.201
STATE AS WELL.

02:56:52.268 --> 02:56:53.736
ON THAT AND THEN ALSO AS WELL

02:56:53.803 --> 02:56:54.270
BUILDING IN SOME OF THOSE

02:56:54.337 --> 02:56:56.038
PROCESS OUT COMES TO MAKE SURE

02:56:56.105 --> 02:56:56.539
WE ARE HEADED THE RIGHT

02:56:56.605 --> 02:56:58.507
DIRECTION AND SOTHEIR INTERIM

02:56:58.574 --> 02:56:59.942
WAYS TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE

02:57:00.009 --> 02:57:02.511
ACCOUNTABLE IN BETWEEN -- BEFORE

02:57:02.578 --> 02:57:04.814
JUST -- SANCTIONING FOR NOT

02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:05.881
MEETING OVERALL OUTCOME.

02:57:05.948 --> 02:57:06.649
SO WOULD THAT BE LIKE

02:57:06.716 --> 02:57:09.919
PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MAYBE

02:57:09.986 --> 02:57:11.821
ALLOCATING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS.

02:57:11.887 --> 02:57:13.155
BASED ON OUTCOMES.

02:57:13.222 --> 02:57:14.523
IT COULD BE ATTACHED TO THAT AS

02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:15.725
WELL I I WOULD ARGUE THAT

02:57:15.791 --> 02:57:17.727
SOMEONE IT IS ACTUALLY ALLOWING

02:57:17.793 --> 02:57:19.795
FOR AN APPROPRIATE TIME LINE FOR

02:57:19.862 --> 02:57:21.263
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD AND

02:57:21.330 --> 02:57:23.099
FOR THOSE METRICS. TO BE

02:57:23.165 --> 02:57:24.367
CAPTURED REPORTED CORRECTLY SO

02:57:24.433 --> 02:57:27.169
FOR EXAMPLE THE AT PRESENT TIME

02:57:27.236 --> 02:57:28.204
THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

02:57:28.270 --> 02:57:30.039
SANCTIONS TO START NEXT YEAR FOR

02:57:30.106 --> 02:57:31.273
THE WHAT IS BEING MEASURED THIS

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:32.541
YEAR AND THOSE EXTRA METRIC OR

02:57:32.608 --> 02:57:34.143
ALREADY PUT IN JUST FOR THIS

02:57:34.210 --> 02:57:34.477
YEAR.

02:57:34.543 --> 02:57:37.213
RIGHT SO TO HAVE THAT SORT OF

02:57:37.279 --> 02:57:39.315
LARGE DICK PUT ON JUST ONE YEAR

02:57:39.382 --> 02:57:41.317
AFTER ADDING IN NEW METRICS THAT

02:57:41.384 --> 02:57:42.084
ARE JUST HAVE NOT BEEN BUILT

02:57:42.151 --> 02:57:43.285
INTO.

02:57:43.352 --> 02:57:44.286
THE NORMAL REPORTING STRUCTURE

02:57:44.353 --> 02:57:46.889
AND A STANDS -- I WOULD I WOULD

02:57:46.956 --> 02:57:49.492
ARGUE IS IS -- MORE SEVERE AND

02:57:49.558 --> 02:57:50.426
ACTUALLY WOULD PROBABLY LEAD TO

02:57:50.493 --> 02:57:51.927
A DID A DIS INCENTIVIZING SOME

02:57:51.994 --> 02:57:53.696
OF THE BEHAVIOR I ALSO WANT TO

02:57:53.763 --> 02:57:54.230
KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE THAT

02:57:54.296 --> 02:57:55.297
SANCTION MONEY GO BECAUSE

02:57:55.364 --> 02:57:56.966
THEORETICALLY YOU WANT THAT

02:57:57.033 --> 02:57:59.602
MONEY TO BE USED -- TO FIND

02:57:59.668 --> 02:58:05.307
ACTUALLY MEETING THOSE METRICS

02:58:05.374 --> 02:58:06.542
AND MAKING SURE THOSE PROVIDERS

02:58:06.609 --> 02:58:07.143
ARE CONSISTENTLY DOING SO AND

02:58:07.209 --> 02:58:07.810
EMPOWERING ALL THE ENTITIES THAT

02:58:07.877 --> 02:58:08.511
ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT

02:58:08.577 --> 02:58:10.980
HAPPEN -- SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT

02:58:11.047 --> 02:58:13.215
YOU KNOW YOU YOU WOULD HAVE -- A

02:58:13.282 --> 02:58:14.784
GREAT IS SCHEDULE AND AND

02:58:14.850 --> 02:58:16.452
ACTUALLY HAVE SOME.

02:58:16.519 --> 02:58:17.987
SOME IN A ROOM I'M STEPS THAT

02:58:18.054 --> 02:58:19.555
NEED TO BE MET TO MEET THAT

02:58:19.622 --> 02:58:21.290
OVERALL OUTCOMES -- AT AS RIGHT

02:58:21.357 --> 02:58:22.491
NOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS JUST TO

02:58:22.558 --> 02:58:24.460
JUMP FROM 25250% MINIMUM

02:58:24.527 --> 02:58:26.095
PERMISSIBLE ON ALL METRICS

02:58:26.162 --> 02:58:27.696
INCLUDING ALL THE NEW METRICS.

02:58:27.763 --> 02:58:31.133
AND FOR A PLAN LIKE OURS THAT --

02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:33.169
SERVICE TWENTY NINE COUNTIES --

02:58:33.235 --> 02:58:35.071
THAT IS IT THAT'S A THAT'S A

02:58:35.137 --> 02:58:37.006
LARGE CHANGE IT AT ONE TIME NOT

02:58:37.073 --> 02:58:37.773
ONE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PUSHING

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:39.041
BACK ON YOU KNOW WITH THE

02:58:39.108 --> 02:58:40.476
INTENTION AND THAT IT SHOULD BE

02:58:40.543 --> 02:58:41.777
DONE IT'S JUST THAT.

02:58:41.844 --> 02:58:44.013
WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IT TAKES

02:58:44.080 --> 02:58:44.914
TO TO TO ACTUALLY MEET THOSE

02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:46.449
METRICS AND AND HAVE THAT HAPPEN

02:58:46.515 --> 02:58:47.950
IN THAT TIME LINE IS A LITTLE

02:58:48.017 --> 02:58:49.952
BIT MORE THAN JUST.

02:58:50.019 --> 02:58:52.621
NEXT YEAR FOR SANCTIONS.

02:58:52.688 --> 02:58:53.289
THANK YOU.

02:58:53.355 --> 02:58:53.522
PLEASE.

02:58:53.589 --> 02:58:55.958
I WOULD OFFER A FEW SUGGESTIONS --

02:58:56.025 --> 02:58:57.660
I THINK FIRST DOCTOR LOWEST

02:58:57.726 --> 02:58:59.361
POINT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE FOR I

02:58:59.428 --> 02:59:01.097
THINK WE SHOULD WE NEED IS PLANS

02:59:01.163 --> 02:59:03.132
VERY VERY SPECIFIC AND WELL

02:59:03.199 --> 02:59:04.333
DEFINED WHAT WHEN A NEW

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:05.868
MEASUREMENTS WOULD BE.

02:59:05.935 --> 02:59:07.770
AND ALSO THE TIME ALLOWED TO SET

02:59:07.837 --> 02:59:10.139
UP -- WHATEVER SYSTEMS ARE

02:59:10.206 --> 02:59:11.740
PROCESSES THAT WE CAN.

02:59:11.807 --> 02:59:13.943
GO TO ATTACK THOSE MEASURES FOR

02:59:14.009 --> 02:59:14.977
EXAMPLE.

02:59:15.044 --> 02:59:18.647
IF OUR PLAN WAS TO DECIDE TO WAY --

02:59:18.714 --> 02:59:20.449
TO HELP INCREASE DEBT LEVELS

02:59:20.516 --> 02:59:21.784
WOULD BE TO ALTER OPPOSITION

02:59:21.851 --> 02:59:23.619
INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO REWARD

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:25.054
PHYSICIANS FOR GETTING MEMBERS

02:59:25.121 --> 02:59:26.255
AND TO MEET THESE.

02:59:26.322 --> 02:59:27.790
NEW GUIDELINES THAT WORKED

02:59:27.857 --> 02:59:29.492
COLLECTED BEFORE WE NEED TIME TO

02:59:29.558 --> 02:59:31.727
SET THAT UP AND CHANGE PROVIDER

02:59:31.794 --> 02:59:33.829
CONTRACTS AND ALL THAT SO -- I

02:59:33.896 --> 02:59:35.731
DON'T THINK BY AS WAS STATED

02:59:35.798 --> 02:59:36.799
EARLIER THAT WERE ALREADY

02:59:36.866 --> 02:59:38.968
TOMORROW WILL BE AND FOUR MONTHS

02:59:39.034 --> 02:59:40.536
INTO THE YEAR AND WE DON'T EVEN

02:59:40.603 --> 02:59:42.404
HAVE THINGS FINALIZED I DON'T

02:59:42.471 --> 02:59:43.839
THINK NEXT YEAR'S RESULTS.

02:59:43.906 --> 02:59:48.144
CAN BE A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT

02:59:48.210 --> 02:59:50.212
THAN THIS YEAR'S -- AND THEN THE

02:59:50.279 --> 02:59:50.813
SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IS AS

02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:52.414
WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE SPECIFIC

02:59:52.481 --> 02:59:55.050
THINGS I WOULD DRILL DOWN AS TO

02:59:55.117 --> 02:59:55.885
ON THIS SPECIFIC AREAS FOR

02:59:55.951 --> 02:59:56.685
EXAMPLE.

02:59:56.752 --> 02:59:58.854
YOU KNOW ZERO FIVE FOR THE MOST

02:59:58.921 --> 03:00:00.322
PART TO READ THE RESULTS ARE ARE

03:00:00.389 --> 03:00:02.892
PRETTY WELL PRETTY GOOD IT'S THE

03:00:02.958 --> 03:00:04.760
ADOLESCENCE THAT ALWAYS BEEN

03:00:04.827 --> 03:00:05.895
DIFFICULT AND THAT THEY HAVE

03:00:05.961 --> 03:00:06.795
ADOLESCENT WELL VISITS HAVE

03:00:06.862 --> 03:00:08.430
ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT NAY BEEN

03:00:08.497 --> 03:00:09.798
HE JUST MEASURE FOR A LONG TIME.

03:00:09.865 --> 03:00:12.234
IT IS CONCEALING DIFFICULT TO

03:00:12.301 --> 03:00:14.537
GET THESE KIDS IN TO THE

03:00:14.603 --> 03:00:16.038
DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND I THINK

03:00:16.105 --> 03:00:19.208
THERE NEEDS TO BE -- EITHER AT A

03:00:19.275 --> 03:00:22.945
KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT OR I'LL

03:00:23.012 --> 03:00:24.446
FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN --

03:00:24.513 --> 03:00:25.080
COLLECTIVELY FIGURE OUT WAYS TO

03:00:25.147 --> 03:00:26.682
DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK GETTING

03:00:26.749 --> 03:00:28.150
ADOLESCENT WELL DOES IT'S UP

03:00:28.217 --> 03:00:29.084
250% WILL BE AN EXTREME

03:00:29.151 --> 03:00:30.653
CHALLENGE OTHERWISE I THINK WE

03:00:30.719 --> 03:00:32.588
NEED TO LOOK AT VERY SPECIFICS

03:00:32.655 --> 03:00:34.857
AND AND TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS AND

03:00:34.924 --> 03:00:38.994
SO AND TO HOW WE CAN BEST OBTAIN.

03:00:39.061 --> 03:00:40.029
WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING?

03:00:40.095 --> 03:00:40.963
FOR AND TO THOSE POINTS DO YOU

03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:42.798
SEE THAT HAPPENING SOLELY

03:00:42.865 --> 03:00:44.366
THROUGH EDUCATION OR IS IT TOO

03:00:44.433 --> 03:00:45.601
YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

03:00:45.668 --> 03:00:48.437
TESTIMONY AS WELL -- INCREASED --

03:00:48.504 --> 03:00:49.705
YOU KNOW MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT

03:00:49.772 --> 03:00:51.340
RATES ARE INCREASED REACH FOR

03:00:51.407 --> 03:00:52.841
THOSE DOCTORS ARE PROVIDING THE

03:00:52.908 --> 03:00:53.475
SERVICES OF THE HARD TO SERVE

03:00:53.542 --> 03:00:54.343
AREAS.

03:00:54.410 --> 03:00:55.778
I SEE IT IS THAT LIKE A PUSH

03:00:55.844 --> 03:00:57.346
PULL STRATEGY WHICH IS AFTER

03:00:57.413 --> 03:00:58.781
HOPEFULLY PROVIDERS AT THE

03:00:58.847 --> 03:01:00.416
REWARDED I WOULD DO IT IN A

03:01:00.482 --> 03:01:02.084
SENTENCE.

03:01:02.151 --> 03:01:03.152
BUT THEY WOULD BRING A MAN.

03:01:03.219 --> 03:01:04.887
TO BRING A MAN WE AND WE PUSH

03:01:04.954 --> 03:01:07.223
OUT -- MEMBER NOTIFICATIONS OR

03:01:07.289 --> 03:01:08.190
YOU KNOW TO THE MEMBER

03:01:08.257 --> 03:01:09.658
NEWSLETTERS OR FOR I KNOW

03:01:09.725 --> 03:01:11.360
THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT USING

03:01:11.427 --> 03:01:14.730
TEXTING PROGRAMS -- GETTING TO

03:01:14.797 --> 03:01:17.166
MEMBERS AT AS MICRO LEVEL AS

03:01:17.233 --> 03:01:18.601
POSSIBLE THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT

03:01:18.667 --> 03:01:19.702
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THE

03:01:19.768 --> 03:01:21.170
INFORMATION WE HAVE ON THEM.

03:01:21.237 --> 03:01:22.705
IT'S NOT ACCURATE CELL PHONE

03:01:22.771 --> 03:01:24.773
NUMBERS ON ACKER THEY'VE CHANGED

03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:26.275
SO WE GET TO THE MEMBERS

03:01:26.342 --> 03:01:27.643
THEMSELVES OF THEIR HEAD OF THE

03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:29.211
HOUSEHOLD OF THE PARENTS.

03:01:29.278 --> 03:01:31.247
IS ARE ON A MICRO LEVEL IS VERY

03:01:31.313 --> 03:01:32.848
DIFFICULT I MEAN WE'RE A SMALL

03:01:32.915 --> 03:01:34.316
PLAN WE HAVE. HUNDRED THOUSAND

03:01:34.383 --> 03:01:36.919
KIDS -- SO IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE

03:01:36.986 --> 03:01:38.354
BUT I WOULD DO THAT I WOULD I

03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:40.122
WOULD FOCUS ON THE MEMBER SITE

03:01:40.189 --> 03:01:41.624
PUSHING OUT GETTING.

03:01:41.690 --> 03:01:43.993
IS MUCH INFORMATION OUT AS WE

03:01:44.059 --> 03:01:45.561
CAN BUT THEN ENCOURAGE THE

03:01:45.628 --> 03:01:47.196
PROVIDERS ON THE OTHER END TO

03:01:47.263 --> 03:01:48.998
HELP ENCOURAGE AND TO PULL THEM

PREVIOUS COMMENTS REGARDING MORE

03:02:04.780 --> 03:02:05.714

SPECIFICALLY THINKING UP THE

03:02:10.552 --> 03:02:12.488
BLOOD LEAD TESTING REQUIREMENT

03:02:12.554 --> 03:02:14.523
FOR ALL MEDI CAL CHILDREN AGE

TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR MONTHS.

03:02:16.792 --> 03:02:18.427
AND THE THE THE REALLY ABYSMAL

03:02:18.494 --> 03:02:20.129
RATE OF OF TESTING AND SO THIS

03:02:20.195 --> 03:02:21.497
IS BEEN A LONGSTANDING

03:02:21.563 --> 03:02:24.533
REQUIREMENT -- PLANS -- DATA CAN

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:27.503
RANGE FROM LESS THAN A HALF TO A

03:02:27.569 --> 03:02:30.773
QUARTER OF CHILDREN -- RECEIVING

03:02:30.839 --> 03:02:33.008
THE ACTUAL TESTING AND SOAK

03:02:33.075 --> 03:02:35.344
CERTAINLY GREATER OVERSIGHT

03:02:35.411 --> 03:02:37.146
ACCOUNTABILITY IF NEEDED -- AS

03:02:37.212 --> 03:02:39.782
WELL AS EDUCATION TO TO

03:02:39.848 --> 03:02:41.817
PROVIDERS AS THIS IS SPECIFIC TO

03:02:41.884 --> 03:02:43.319
TO MEDI CAL CHILDREN OTHER

03:02:43.385 --> 03:02:44.420
CHILDREN ARE.

03:02:44.486 --> 03:02:47.356
ARE NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED --

03:02:47.423 --> 03:02:48.857
TO AT TO HAVE THIS THIS BENEFIT

03:02:48.924 --> 03:02:50.225
THERE IS THE RECOGNITION THAT

03:02:50.292 --> 03:02:52.728
LOW INCOME CHILDREN LIVE IN

03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:54.029
OLDER HOUSES ARE MORE.

03:02:54.096 --> 03:02:56.131
SUSCEPTIBLE TO TO LEAD POISONING

03:02:56.198 --> 03:02:57.099
AND SO THIS IS A REQUIREMENT IN

03:02:57.166 --> 03:02:58.267
SO I WOULD SAY GREATER

03:02:58.334 --> 03:03:01.637
ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL AS

03:03:01.704 --> 03:03:07.176

THERE'S A I REQUEST OR SOME

03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:11.747
LEGISLATION ON THAT POINT

03:03:11.814 --> 03:03:12.648
EXACTLY.

03:03:12.715 --> 03:03:13.816
SO AND I THINK THAT'S MOVING

03:03:13.882 --> 03:03:15.551
FORWARD AND YOU KNOW THERE'S

03:03:15.617 --> 03:03:16.385
SOME OTHER SOLUTION DR WOODS GOT.

03:03:45.481 --> 03:03:47.383
BROKE ONE OF FOCUS HERE FOR A

03:03:47.449 --> 03:03:49.585
MINUTE -- WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP

03:03:49.651 --> 03:03:51.987
YOUR NETWORK -- PROVIDERS -- YOU

03:03:52.054 --> 03:03:53.422
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY

03:03:53.489 --> 03:03:54.823
YOUR PROVIDERS.

03:03:54.890 --> 03:03:56.191
WHAT'S THE STARTING POINT FOR

03:03:56.258 --> 03:03:57.693
NEGOTIATIONS WERE YOU START YOU

03:03:57.760 --> 03:03:59.962
START AT THE MEDICAL RATE DO YOU

03:04:00.028 --> 03:04:01.897
STARTED A COMMERCIAL RATE I MEAN.

03:04:01.964 --> 03:04:03.766
IT'S OBVIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO GET

03:04:03.832 --> 03:04:06.502
PROVIDERS -- IN IN SOME OF THESE

03:04:06.568 --> 03:04:09.138
PLANS SO WHERE DO YOU START.

03:04:09.204 --> 03:04:10.639
WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE PROVIDER

03:04:10.706 --> 03:04:12.674
CLASSIFICATION FOR PRIMARY CARE

03:04:12.741 --> 03:04:14.443
PROVIDERS WE WE CAPITATE THEM

03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:16.378
AND THE CAPITATION RATES BASED

03:04:16.445 --> 03:04:18.046
ON THE ACUITY OF THEIR THEIR

03:04:18.113 --> 03:04:20.149
PATIENTS SO WE CAN GO UP OR DOWN.

03:04:20.215 --> 03:04:22.618
AND THEN WE ALSO -- DO A

03:04:22.684 --> 03:04:23.919
POSITION IN CENTER PROGRAM WORK

03:04:23.986 --> 03:04:26.088
GROUP THAT REWARDS THE

03:04:26.155 --> 03:04:28.824
PHYSICIANS FOR DOING ACTIVITIES

03:04:28.891 --> 03:04:32.461
THAT WE SUPPORT LIKE HAVING --

03:04:32.528 --> 03:04:34.797
LATE HOURS OR OR BEING OPEN THE

03:04:34.863 --> 03:04:36.231
WEEKENDS SENATE ON THOSE LINES

03:04:36.298 --> 03:04:37.766
AND THAT'S FAIRLY STANDARD --

03:04:37.833 --> 03:04:40.536
IT'S IT'S AN ACTUAL I ARE BASED

03:04:40.602 --> 03:04:43.405
ON THE SPECIALISTS -- IT'S

03:04:43.472 --> 03:04:44.940
BASICALLY A CALM IT'S A

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:47.409
COMBINATION OF HOW MUCH.

03:04:47.476 --> 03:04:51.947
IN DEMAND THEY ARE AND SO WE PAY

03:04:52.014 --> 03:04:53.916
OFF THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE.

03:04:53.982 --> 03:04:56.118
AND DEPENDING ON HOW -- MUCH

03:04:56.185 --> 03:04:58.187
BELOW OR ABOVE THEN IT DEPENDS

03:04:58.253 --> 03:04:59.955
ON THE SCARCITY OF THE PROVIDER

03:05:00.022 --> 03:05:01.523
AND DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES.

03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:05.928
IT ALSO INVOLVES THE DESPITE THE

03:05:05.994 --> 03:05:07.329
THE SPECIALTY MEANING WE CAN

03:05:07.396 --> 03:05:12.901
CERTAINLY PAY A NEUROLOGIST MORE.

03:05:12.968 --> 03:05:14.436
BECAUSE WE DON'T USE THEM.

03:05:14.503 --> 03:05:16.004
HIS OFTEN THEY WOULDN'T BE SHE

03:05:16.071 --> 03:05:17.473
SAID SHE WOULD LIKE AND BUT I

03:05:17.539 --> 03:05:17.739
WILL BE.

03:05:17.806 --> 03:05:20.209
SO IT'S IT'S BASED ON THE DEMAND

03:05:20.275 --> 03:05:21.009
FOR THEIR SERVICES --

03:05:21.076 --> 03:05:23.579
COMPETITION.

03:05:23.645 --> 03:05:28.116
AND THEN -- YEAH THE THOSE TWO

03:05:28.183 --> 03:05:28.984
THINGS IN THERE AND WE WE'RE

03:05:29.051 --> 03:05:31.386
WE'RE PRETTY FLEXIBLE IN TERMS

03:05:31.453 --> 03:05:32.988

TO NEGOTIATE UPWARD.

03:05:53.041 --> 03:05:54.977
DEPENDING YES DEPENDING ON HOW

WHEN YOU DO THAT WHAT'S THE

03:06:01.416 --> 03:06:03.051
RESPONSE FROM THE STATE AS THEY

03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:07.656
YOUR EXPERIENCE AS WELL?

03:06:07.723 --> 03:06:09.658
MY EXPERIENCE AND I'M NOT -- I

03:06:09.725 --> 03:06:11.159
DON'T DEAL WITH THE THE RATE

03:06:11.226 --> 03:06:12.561
PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY MY

03:06:12.628 --> 03:06:15.163
EXPERIENCE AS THEY LOOK AT OUR

03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:17.966
PHYSICIAN COSTS IN TOTALITY.

03:06:18.033 --> 03:06:18.600
AND THEY MAY LOOK AT DIFFERENT

03:06:18.667 --> 03:06:20.869
SPECIALTIES -- INDIVIDUAL DOWN

03:06:20.936 --> 03:06:22.538
USUALLY THEY'LL SAY HEY HOW COME

03:06:22.604 --> 03:06:24.039

03:06:24.106 --> 03:06:25.107
NEUROSURGEON SO MUCH AND ALSO

MILES -- AND AND THEY HAVE A

03:06:29.578 --> 03:06:30.846
FULL WAITING ROOM.

WITH OR WITHOUT MEDI CAL

03:06:32.314 --> 03:06:34.383
PATIENTS SO THIS IS WHAT WE HAD

03:06:34.449 --> 03:06:36.184
TO DO TO ENSURE ACCESS AND

03:06:36.251 --> 03:06:38.487
THAT'S USUALLY SUFFICIENT -- I

03:06:38.554 --> 03:06:41.223
THINK IF IT WAS ON A A BROAD

03:06:41.290 --> 03:06:43.458
BASIS WHERE YOU'RE -- THAT I

FEE SCHEDULE SO YOU WOULD YOU

03:06:53.101 --> 03:06:55.137
WOULD LIKELY GET MORE IN DEPTH

03:06:55.203 --> 03:06:59.474
QUESTIONS -- INTEREST

03:06:59.541 --> 03:07:00.943
INTERESTING SO.

PHYSICIANS AND NUMBERS OF

03:07:10.185 --> 03:07:12.387
PHYSICIANS THAT SORT OF THING --

03:07:12.454 --> 03:07:13.689
IS IT THE SPECIALIST THAT YOU

03:07:13.755 --> 03:07:15.991

YOU KNOW AS FAR AS GETTING

03:07:17.793 --> 03:07:20.462

OR NO FRAUD JUST OR SOMETHING

03:07:26.168 --> 03:07:27.803
YOU KNOW OR NEUROLOGISTS

03:07:27.869 --> 03:07:29.504
SPECIFICALLY AROUND PEDIATRICS

03:07:29.571 --> 03:07:30.739
THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT

LEAD THE CLINICAL ARM MOSTLY AT

03:07:45.487 --> 03:07:46.989
THE PLAN AND SO I PURPOSEFULLY

03:07:47.055 --> 03:07:48.657

CARE IS NOT IS NOT TYPICALLY

03:08:00.302 --> 03:08:01.470
THE ISSUE IT IS MUCH MORE

03:08:01.536 --> 03:08:02.471
THE SPECIALTY CARE AND EVEN

03:08:02.537 --> 03:08:04.272
THE SUB SUB SPECIALISTS FOR

03:08:04.339 --> 03:08:06.475
PARTICULAR COMPLEX CONDITIONS

03:08:06.541 --> 03:08:08.477
-- AND THINGS THAT NEED A

03:08:08.543 --> 03:08:10.145
NO TERTIARY CARE SETTINGS

03:08:10.212 --> 03:08:12.014

03:08:15.917 --> 03:08:17.219
HARDER TO FIND IN THAT VERY

03:08:17.285 --> 03:08:18.820
MUCH VARIES INDEFINITELY IS

03:08:18.887 --> 03:08:19.988

WE HAVE LESS PROBLEM FINDING

03:08:23.425 --> 03:08:25.027
THAT IN LOS ANGELES OBVIOUSLY

03:08:25.093 --> 03:08:26.895
THAT ANY OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES

03:08:26.962 --> 03:08:28.363
AND SO THOSE THINGS GO INTO

03:08:28.430 --> 03:08:29.598
ACCOUNT WHEN WHERE YOU KNOW

03:08:29.665 --> 03:08:33.135
