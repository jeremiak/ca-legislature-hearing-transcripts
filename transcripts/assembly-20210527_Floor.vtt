01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:40.594
MEASURE- IN THE LAST TWO

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:41.094
ELECTIONS WE HAD SPECIAL

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:44.898
ELECTION. ONE IN DISTRICT

01:46:44.965 --> 01:46:45.732
SEVENTY NINE WONDER DISTRICT

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:48.602
FIFTY FOUR. DISTRICT SEVENTY

01:46:48.668 --> 01:46:51.972

THEY'RE ALL MAIL BALLOTS THERE

01:46:53.573 --> 01:46:55.842
ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:57.644
MAIL BALLOTS SENT OUT. AND

01:46:57.711 --> 01:46:59.045
THOSE BALLOTS COST TWO DOLLARS

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:00.480
AND FIFTY CENTS APIECE TO SEND

01:47:00.547 --> 01:47:03.917
OUT. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:07.020
BASICALLY WITH. WHERE IF YOU'RE

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:09.222
LOOKING AT THESE THESE NUMBERS.

01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:11.391
IS FOR- FOR THE SEVENTY NINE TH

01:47:11.458 --> 01:47:15.262
DISTRICT. SEVENTY NINE OUT OF A

01:47:15.328 --> 01:47:16.630
HUNDRED BALLOTS GOT THROWN IN

01:47:16.696 --> 01:47:19.566
THE TRASH. THAT MEANS THAT

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:23.770
MEANS. CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED

01:47:23.837 --> 01:47:24.271
THOUSAND DOLLARS OF OUR

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:25.906
TAXPAYER DOLLARS WENT DIRECTLY

01:47:25.972 --> 01:47:28.308
IN THE TRASH. FOR THE FIFTY

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:29.509
FOURTH DISTRICT IT WAS EVEN

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:34.981
WORSE. IT WAS 14% 14% THAT

01:47:35.048 --> 01:47:39.519
MEANS. EIGHTY SIX OF A HUNDRED

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:41.454
BALLOTS WENT IN THE TRASH

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:43.623
THAT'S OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. SO

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.325
IT APPEARS THAT WHILE THIS MAY

01:47:45.392 --> 01:47:47.627
WORK WELL IN SOME ELECTIONS IT

01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:49.763
DOESN'T WORK WELL IN OTHERS AND

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:53.200
SO IF WE WANT TO REFORM. THIS

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:57.137
BALLOT ALSO IN ORDER TO GIVE

01:47:57.204 --> 01:47:59.039
PEOPLE GREATER ACCESS IT

01:47:59.105 --> 01:48:00.307
DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THIS IS THE

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:02.542
ONLY ANSWER AND WHAT I THINK WE

01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:04.377
NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO PUT A

01:48:04.444 --> 01:48:06.780
COMMISSION TOGETHER STUDY THIS

01:48:06.847 --> 01:48:10.383
FIGURE OUT WHAT WILL CREATE A

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:13.119
MORE JUST AND IN A BETTER

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:15.488
SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE. AND

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:17.490
AND THEN ENACT LAWS THAT WILL

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:20.093
DO THAT. BECAUSE THIS PIECEMEAL

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.429
APPROACH IS NOT WORKING. IT IS

01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:24.497
NOT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

01:48:24.564 --> 01:48:27.467
BALLOTS BEING RETURNED IN THESE

01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:28.501
PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BALLOTS AFTER

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:30.604
HOUSE THEY COULDN'T MARK ONE

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:33.306
SPOT AND SEND IT IN. SO THAT IS

01:48:33.373 --> 01:48:35.108
NOT ACCESS TO BALLOTING IS NOT

01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:37.444
THE PROBLEM HERE. WE NEED TO

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:38.478
LOOK AT THAT MORE CAREFULLY

01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:40.547
FIND OT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

01:48:40.614 --> 01:48:43.250
AND FIX THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:00:36.128 --> 02:00:37.730

US YEAR. AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR

02:00:40.399 --> 02:00:43.669
OF ABJECT FAILURE AT THE EDT WE

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:45.237
EVENTUALLY GET A STATE AUDIT

LEGISLATION AND THEN HOPEFULLY

02:00:54.614 --> 02:00:56.315
WE'LL BE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE

02:00:56.382 --> 02:00:58.751
EDT IT'S REALLY BORING THE LINE

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:00.553
BETWEEN LEGISLATION AND

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:01.354
MANAGEMENT THE WAY THAT IT

02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:03.189
OUGHT TO WORK IS THAT WE OUGHT

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:23.175
MANAGEMENT AT THAT AGENCY IS A

02:01:23.242 --> 02:01:24.677
PART OF THE PROBLEM AND THE

02:01:24.744 --> 02:01:26.178
FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE HAVE

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:28.981

A MORE MODERN- AND EFFECTIVE

LARGER TARGET ON THE BACK OF

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:20.858
EVERY JEWISH STUDENT. BUT THE

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:24.095
ANTISEMITISM. IS JUST ONE

02:28:24.161 --> 02:28:26.497
MANIFESTATION OF WHAT IS SO

FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. WITH THIS

02:28:28.532 --> 02:28:30.501
PROPOSED CURRICULUM. AND IT'S

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:31.802

02:28:35.573 --> 02:28:38.309
IMPOSE A PARTICULAR WORLD VIEW

02:28:38.376 --> 02:28:40.511

SOMEHOW IN SERVICE OF EQUITY.

02:28:56.494 --> 02:28:57.662
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT

02:28:57.728 --> 02:29:00.798
EQUITY IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM

02:29:00.865 --> 02:29:03.067
IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATION.

02:29:03.134 --> 02:29:05.236

STANDING COMPARED TO THE REST

02:29:20.551 --> 02:29:22.586
OF THE COUNTRY. AND THE

02:29:22.653 --> 02:29:25.156
SITUATION WAS SO BAD THAT YOU

02:29:25.222 --> 02:29:27.792
HAD A LAWSUIT BROUGHT. BY

02:29:27.858 --> 02:29:29.527
STUDENTS AGAINST THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA FOR VIOLATING THEIR

02:29:32.697 --> 02:29:35.533
CIVIL RIGHTS. BASED UPON THEM

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:37.501
NOT BEING TAUGHT HOW TO READ

02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:39.070

WHEN I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE.

02:30:01.192 --> 02:30:02.493

02:31:12.163 --> 02:31:13.597
AND YET THERE'S A STILL MORE

02:31:13.664 --> 02:31:16.066
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE. AS

02:31:16.133 --> 02:31:18.202
CURRICULUM LIKE THIS CURRICULA

02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:20.204
LIKE THIS ARE BEING PROPOSED

02:31:20.271 --> 02:31:22.306
NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN

02:31:22.373 --> 02:31:23.407
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:25.976
WELL. IN SOME CASES THEIR WELL

02:31:26.043 --> 02:31:27.711
INTENDED ANOTHER CASES THEY'RE

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:31.415
NOT. BUT IN ALL CASES. IT IS

02:31:31.482 --> 02:31:33.250
EXPLOITING WHAT I BELIEVE IS A

02:31:33.317 --> 02:31:36.987
VOID. THAT HAS COME TO EXIST IN

02:31:37.054 --> 02:31:38.322
PUBLIC EDUCATION NOT JUST IN

02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:39.323
THE STATE BUT ACROSS THE

02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:40.324
COUNTRY AND THAT IS WE'VE LOST

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:42.426
TOUCH. WITH WHAT EDUCATION IS

02:31:42.493 --> 02:31:44.395
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:31:44.462 --> 02:31:47.064
THE UNIFYING THREAD. OF

02:31:47.131 --> 02:31:49.733
EDUCATION THIRTY SECONDS. YOUNG

02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:52.169
PEOPLE TO BE CITIZENS TO BE

02:31:52.236 --> 02:31:53.003
ACTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS

02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:55.039
OF SOCIETY. THAT'S WHAT BOUND

02:31:55.105 --> 02:31:56.874
EDUCATION TOGETHER IT WAS THE

02:31:56.941 --> 02:31:58.108
LINCHPIN OF SELF GOVERNMENT

02:31:58.175 --> 02:31:58.909
BILL WE DON'T REALLY THINK

02:31:58.976 --> 02:32:00.945
ABOUT EDUCATION THAT WAY

02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:02.480
ANYMORE AND SO I THINK A

02:32:02.546 --> 02:32:03.514
CURRICULUM LIKE THIS IS COMING

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:05.349
ALONG. AND IS TRYING TO FILL

02:32:05.416 --> 02:32:07.151
THAT VOID IT'S LIKE THE ANTI

02:32:07.218 --> 02:32:09.620
CIVICS. RATHER THAN HAVING THE

02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:11.188
UNIFYING THREAD OF EDUCATION

02:32:11.255 --> 02:32:12.623
THE BUILDING COMMUNITIES UP

02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:14.158
IT'S TEARING COMMUNITIES DOWN

02:32:14.225 --> 02:32:15.092
SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:16.861
OPPOSE THIS MEASURE TODAY. AND

02:32:16.927 --> 02:32:18.295
WE NEED TO HAVE A RENEWAL IN

02:32:18.362 --> 02:32:21.799
THIS STATE OF THE TRUE CIVIC

02:32:21.866 --> 02:32:25.870
PURPOSE OF EDUCATION THANK YOU.

THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE THAT

02:32:52.596 --> 02:32:54.298
ARE BEING CONFLATED. THERE WAS

02:32:54.365 --> 02:32:55.933
A MODEL CURRICULUM IN INITIAL

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.334
DRAFT OF WHICH CAME OUT THAT

CONTROLLING MANIPULATE THE

02:33:05.209 --> 02:33:06.076
MEDIA THINGS THAT OUR

TO THE TABLE WE ENGAGE WITH

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:13.551
STAKEHOLDERS. THERE WAS A

02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:14.985
ROBUST PROCESS THAT THE

02:33:15.052 --> 02:33:15.986
INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY

02:33:16.053 --> 02:33:17.354
COMMISSION. APPROVED BY THE

02:33:17.421 --> 02:33:18.556
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION WE HAD

02:33:18.622 --> 02:33:21.525
<u> CURRICULA MODEL CURRICULUM.</u>

02:33:21.592 --> 02:33:22.159
THERE WAS VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUSLY

02:33:22.226 --> 02:33:24.061
ADOPTED. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:25.496
CAME TOGETHER THAT SAID THAT.

02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:26.564
THE PEOPLE INSTRUCTIONAL

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:27.932
QUALITY COMMISSION LIKE OUR

02:33:27.998 --> 02:33:28.999
FORMER COLLEAGUE DR SHIRLEY

02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:31.135
WEBER. PRAISE THAT THAT THE

02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:32.403
LORD SWEAR TO PRAISE THAT

02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:33.704
LEADERS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY

02:33:33.771 --> 02:33:35.706
STOOD UP AND PRAISED. NOW THERE

02:33:35.773 --> 02:33:37.274
ARE VOICES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:38.976
SOME THAT THAT ARE STILL

02:33:39.043 --> 02:33:40.411
CONCERNED ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES

02:33:40.477 --> 02:33:41.779
THAT STILL. HAVE OBJECTIONS TO

02:33:41.845 --> 02:33:44.381
IT. BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

02:33:44.448 --> 02:33:46.417
JEWISH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

02:33:46.483 --> 02:33:48.185
THAT HAVE LARGER MEMBERSHIP

02:33:48.252 --> 02:33:49.787
THAT SPEAK FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:50.854
ARE PROUD OF WHAT'S IN THE

02:33:50.921 --> 02:33:52.222
MODEL CURRICULUM. THEY

02:33:52.289 --> 02:33:53.057
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

02:33:53.123 --> 02:33:54.625
INCLUDES LESSON PLANS ON ON THE

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:56.694
JEWISH AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. WE

02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:57.595
APPRECIATE THE APPROACH THAT IT

02:33:57.661 --> 02:33:59.697
TAKES. AND SO WE ARE GOING TO

02:33:59.763 --> 02:34:00.631
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THIS

02:34:00.698 --> 02:34:02.733
CONVERSATION BUT I LOOK FORWARD

02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:03.801
TO VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY I

02:34:03.867 --> 02:34:05.836
WANT TO COMMEND. THE AUTHOR FOR

02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:06.937
THE SENSITIVE WAY THAT HE HAS

02:34:07.004 --> 02:34:08.105
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT

02:34:08.172 --> 02:34:10.007
SOMEONE UP COMMAND A LOT OF OUR

02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:10.808
COLLEAGUES TO COME UP AND ASK

02:34:10.874 --> 02:34:12.509
ME ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE THESE

02:34:12.576 --> 02:34:13.644
ARE THE KIND OF TOUCH THINGS

02:34:13.711 --> 02:34:14.945
THAT CAN START OUT AND USUALLY

02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:16.914
BE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS. BUT I

02:34:16.981 --> 02:34:18.182
THINK WITH THE MODEL CURRICULUM

02:34:18.248 --> 02:34:20.017
WE HAVE SET THIS IN A DIRECTION

02:34:20.084 --> 02:34:21.919
THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:23.287
OF CALIFORNIANS CAN FEEL GOOD

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:24.488
ABOUT. SO WHAT I WOULD

02:34:24.555 --> 02:34:25.789
RESPECTFULLY ASK IS THAT IF

02:34:25.856 --> 02:34:27.157
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE

02:34:27.224 --> 02:34:28.759

JEWISH CAUCUSES THAT COME TALK

02:34:30.127 --> 02:34:31.629
TO US. WE DON'T NEED ANYBODY TO

02:34:31.695 --> 02:34:33.297
SPEAK FOR US WE CAN SPEAK FOR

02:34:33.364 --> 02:34:35.032
OURSELVES AND SO WITHOUT

02:34:35.099 --> 02:34:37.534
RESPECTFULLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES

SUPPORT OF AB ONE OH ONE AS A

02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:51.315
PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS VERY

02:34:51.382 --> 02:34:54.118
IMPORTANT MEASURE. WHEN I WAS

02:34:54.184 --> 02:34:56.120
IN SCHOOL I WAS TAUGHT THAT

02:34:56.186 --> 02:34:58.288
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS DISCOVERED

02:34:58.355 --> 02:35:00.824
AMERICA. AND THAT THE ONLY

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.026
THING SIGNIFICANT AND BLACK

02:35:02.092 --> 02:35:05.062
HISTORY WAS THE I HAVE A DREAM

02:35:05.129 --> 02:35:05.629
SPEECH GIVEN BY MARTHA KING

VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT BLACK

02:35:12.436 --> 02:35:14.371
HISTORY. SO I LEARNED MY

02:35:14.438 --> 02:35:16.373
HISTORY FROM THEM AND FROM THE

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:18.976
MANY HOURS I SPENT AS A CHILD

DIFFERENT RACIAL AND ETHNIC

02:35:39.863 --> 02:35:40.964

ONLY UNDERSTAND THOSE

02:36:06.557 --> 02:36:09.126
DIFFERENCES. BUT ALSO CELEBRATE

02:36:09.193 --> 02:36:12.262
AND EMBRACE THEM. AT THE MOST

02:36:12.329 --> 02:36:13.397
ONE OF THE MOST FORMATIVE TIMES

02:36:13.464 --> 02:36:16.200

IRATE RICE AS A MATH TEACHER

02:36:56.173 --> 02:36:58.776
FOR THIRTEEN YEARS- BUT THEIR

02:36:58.842 --> 02:36:59.610
CREDENTIAL AND A LOT OF

02:36:59.676 --> 02:37:02.112
PRACTICE- IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

02:37:02.179 --> 02:37:03.814
SAY WE WERE IN THE CLASSROOM TO

02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:05.282
SPEAK FOR ALL TO YOURSELF THERE.

02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:06.617
BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS I WAS

02:37:06.683 --> 02:37:07.918
A MATH TEACHER BUT I KNOW THIS

02:37:07.985 --> 02:37:09.987
MIGHT SAID OF MY STUDENTS SAW.

02:37:10.053 --> 02:37:11.622
THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THEIR

02:37:11.688 --> 02:37:12.389
SCHOOLS THEY WOULD'VE BEEN MUCH

02:37:12.456 --> 02:37:14.224
MORE EXCITED TO COME TO SCHOOL

02:37:14.291 --> 02:37:15.159
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH RIGHT

02:37:15.225 --> 02:37:16.160
HAD IT TO DO THE WORK THAT WE

02:37:16.226 --> 02:37:18.162
ASK THEM TO DO OUT THERE. WHEN

02:37:18.228 --> 02:37:19.029
WE TEACH THEM ABOUT THEIR

02:37:19.096 --> 02:37:20.097
HISTORY TEACHER ABOUT THEIR

02:37:20.164 --> 02:37:21.298
STRENGTH WITH THE TIME ABOUT

02:37:21.365 --> 02:37:23.100
THE RESILIENCY WE TEACH THEM

02:37:23.167 --> 02:37:24.434
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T

02:37:24.501 --> 02:37:25.736
ALWAYS BEEN STRUGGLING AND THAT

02:37:25.803 --> 02:37:27.070
THIS WITH ONCE OUR LAND.

02:37:27.137 --> 02:37:28.505
ANYTHING THAT PRIDE IS WHAT WE

02:37:28.572 --> 02:37:29.606
MIGHT BE TO CARRY FORWARD IN

02:37:29.673 --> 02:37:32.576
pTHERE. AND SO IF WE'RE GONNA

02:37:32.643 --> 02:37:34.378
STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN

02:37:34.444 --> 02:37:36.713
MATH AS WE ELEVATES THEM OUT

LEARNING THT. ON LAND THAT WAS

02:39:20.684 --> 02:39:22.719
THEN BELONGING TO THE COUNTRY

02:39:22.786 --> 02:39:24.288

HERE IN NEVER BEING TOLD THAT

02:39:32.896 --> 02:39:33.397
THIS WAS ONCE THE COUNTRY HE

02:39:33.463 --> 02:39:36.934
CAME FROM. THESE ARE REAL

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.001
THINGS THAT STUDENTS GO

02:39:38.068 --> 02:39:41.338

STUDIES PROVE IT. IT IS

02:40:16.506 --> 02:40:19.176
SHAMEFUL THAT FOR SEVEN YEARS

02:40:19.242 --> 02:40:21.011

02:40:21.078 --> 02:40:22.946
ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES. IN IT

02:40:23.013 --> 02:40:24.348
SHAMEFUL THAT IT'S BECOME

02:40:24.414 --> 02:40:26.083
WEAPONIZED IN A WAY THAT WE SAW

02:40:26.149 --> 02:40:28.285

ISN'T EVEN ABOUT SOME SPECIAL

02:40:40.330 --> 02:40:42.699
CATEGORICAL HISTORY THIS IS THE

02:40:42.766 --> 02:40:44.534
HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE

02:40:44.601 --> 02:40:46.903
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES IT

02:40:46.970 --> 02:40:48.338
IS THE TRUTH AND WHY WOULD WE

02:40:48.405 --> 02:40:51.074
EVER FIGHT TEACHING CHILDREN.

02:40:51.141 --> 02:40:53.877
ABOUT THE TRUTH ABOUT HISTORY.

02:40:53.944 --> 02:40:55.078
WHETHER IT'S TALKING ABOUT OUR

02:40:55.145 --> 02:40:56.780
FOUNDING FATHERS IN THE FEET

02:40:56.847 --> 02:40:58.615
THREE FIFTHS COMPROMISE THAT

02:40:58.682 --> 02:41:00.150
THAT SAID THAT BLACK

02:41:00.217 --> 02:41:02.185
INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT WORTHY OF

02:41:02.252 --> 02:41:04.888
A FULL PERSON AT A FULL VOTE OR

02:41:04.955 --> 02:41:06.490
THEIR WHETHER TALKING ABOUT OUR

02:41:06.556 --> 02:41:08.625
BEAUTIFUL CATALINA ISLAND WHICH

02:41:08.692 --> 02:41:10.293
BY A TREATY ACTUALLY TODAY

02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:12.496
STILL BELONGS TO MEXICO BUT WAS

02:41:12.562 --> 02:41:15.465
TAKEN. BY CAPITALIST WHO

02:41:15.532 --> 02:41:17.367
DECIDED HE COULD PURCHASE IT.

02:41:17.434 --> 02:41:20.670
THAT IS THE TRUTH IT'S HISTORY.

02:41:20.737 --> 02:41:22.172
IT'S NOT JUDGMENTAL IT'S

02:41:22.239 --> 02:41:24.141
SOMETHING PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT

02:41:24.207 --> 02:41:26.209
TO LEARN AND OUR KIDS AND OUR

02:41:26.276 --> 02:41:27.344
STUDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:41:27.411 --> 02:41:29.279
LEARN IT NOT EVERY STUDENT

02:41:29.346 --> 02:41:31.448
PUBLIC SCHOOL HAVE THE BENEFIT

02:41:31.515 --> 02:41:33.050
OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM SAN

02:41:33.116 --> 02:41:35.318
DIEGO. I DIDN'T HAVE THAT

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:36.753
BENEFIT TO SIT THROUGH ETHNIC

02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:38.922
STUDIES CLASS IN COLLEGE I DID

02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:39.890
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A MOTHER

02:41:39.956 --> 02:41:41.358
WHO CARED SO DEEPLY ABOUT ME

02:41:41.425 --> 02:41:42.592
UNDERSTANDING MY HISTORY THAT

02:41:42.659 --> 02:41:43.727
SHE DID HER BEST TO TEACH ME

02:41:43.794 --> 02:41:45.629
DESPITE. HAVING NEVER TAKEN

02:41:45.695 --> 02:41:47.297
ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS HERSELF.

02:41:47.364 --> 02:41:49.299
BUT WHEN I GOT STANFORD AND I

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:50.834
WAS ABLE TO TAKE COURSES THAT

02:41:50.901 --> 02:41:52.169
SPECIFICALLY TALK TO THE

02:41:52.235 --> 02:41:54.571
HISTORY OF MY PEOPLE OF MY

02:41:54.638 --> 02:41:56.973
IMMIGRANT FATHER OF MY MOTHER

OF MY CLASSMATES AND MY

02:41:58.775 --> 02:42:01.178
COLLEAGUES. AWAKENING THAT

02:42:01.244 --> 02:42:04.581
CAUSES AN A STUDENT TO WANT TO

02:42:04.648 --> 02:42:07.551
LEARN MORE. TOOK TO DESIRE TO

02:42:07.617 --> 02:42:09.219
CHANGE THINGS TO MAKE THINGS

02:42:09.286 --> 02:42:11.088
BETTER FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.

02:42:11.154 --> 02:42:12.856

02:45:08.331 --> 02:45:10.934
EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE. BUT

02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:12.902
THERE IS NO GRAVER CHALLENGE

02:45:12.969 --> 02:45:15.772
ACROSS THE GLOBE. THEN THE

02:45:15.839 --> 02:45:18.875
ABILITY OF PEOPLE. TO LOOK AT

02:45:18.942 --> 02:45:20.744
OTHERS NOT LIKE THEM WITH

02:45:20.810 --> 02:45:24.281

UNDERSTANDING. WE ARE SEEING

02:45:27.951 --> 02:45:29.819
THIS THIS IS THE MOMENT A

02:45:29.886 --> 02:45:30.854
HISTORY WHICH WERE STANDARD

02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:32.422
WHERE WE HAVE BROADENED

02:45:32.489 --> 02:45:34.758
CONNECTIONS THE GLOW. BUT WHAT

02:45:34.824 --> 02:45:37.394
WE SEE IS A GREAT OUTPOURING OF

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:39.596
HOSTILITY AND DIVISION FOCUSED

02:45:39.663 --> 02:45:42.232
ON DIFFERENCES. AND YES OUR

02:45:42.299 --> 02:45:48.438

USING ONLINE TOOLSOTHER SORTS

02:45:50.674 --> 02:45:53.443
OF THINGS THIS IS A PROFOUND

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:56.813
IRAQ. FOR THE EXPERIMENT IN

02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:58.148
DEMOCRACY THE START WITH OUR

02:45:58.214 --> 02:46:01.151
NATION. TO SEE HOW IT WILL END

02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:04.854
DOOR IN AN ERA OF SUCH DIVISION

02:46:04.921 --> 02:46:07.123
OF SUCH HOSTILITY OF SUCH A

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:08.892
READINESS TO CASTIGATE AND

02:46:08.958 --> 02:46:13.029
DENIGRATE. OTHERS WHO MAY BE

02:46:13.096 --> 02:46:17.267
DIFFERENT. I THINK FOR US IN

EMPATHY. IT IS INDEED A

02:46:28.345 --> 02:46:30.980
RESPONSE TO WHAT IS A PROFOUND

02:46:31.047 --> 02:46:33.216
ACCIDENTAL STRESS EXISTENTIAL

02:46:33.283 --> 02:46:35.719
THREAT TO DEMOCRACY AND IF I

02:46:35.785 --> 02:46:37.087
MAY BRING IT HOME SEVERAL

02:46:37.153 --> 02:46:39.689
DECADES AGO. RON THE TIME OF MY

02:47:00.777 --> 02:47:03.680
THAT. THEY WERE ALWAYS HAPPY

02:47:03.747 --> 02:47:05.782
WITH THE EDUCATION THEY GOT

02:47:05.849 --> 02:47:06.716
THEY HAD GRIPES ABOUT THE

02:47:06.783 --> 02:47:08.785
SCHOOLS BUT THEY TOTALLY

02:47:08.852 --> 02:47:11.087
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE BETTER

02:47:11.154 --> 02:47:12.689
EQUIPPED TO GO INTO THE

02:47:12.756 --> 02:47:14.424
WORKFORCE IN THE MODERN WORLD.

02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:15.825

02:47:17.494 --> 02:47:19.596
RESPECT OTHERS TO FUNCTION AMID

02:47:19.662 --> 02:47:22.465
DIVERSITY. SO I FEEL THAT THIS

02:47:22.532 --> 02:47:24.801

PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY

02:50:28.051 --> 02:50:29.619
