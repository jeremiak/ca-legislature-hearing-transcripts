PUT SOMEONE INTO A T. WHEN IT IS

IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FACING

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:04.610
ESPECIALLY MANY OF OUR MAJOR

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:05.845
CITIES.

EFFORTS TO ASSIST US IN

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.219
ADDRESSING -- WHAT WE KNOW IS A

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:15.788
REAL CRISIS A CRISIS AROUND

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.491
HOMELESSNESS A MENTAL HEALTH --

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:20.526
CHALLENGES AND SUBSTANCE USE

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.728
DISORDER AND THERE ARE A NUMBER

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.230
OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE KNOW WHO

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:25.798
ARE SUFFERING FROM A COMBINATION

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:28.634
OF ALL THREE WHICH IS WHAT

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:30.603
BRINGS US HERE TODAY. FOR PEOPLE

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.772
WHO ARE EXPERIENCING JUST ONE OF

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:34.640
THESE PARTICULAR SYMPTOMS IT IS

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.575
CHALLENGING ENOUGH BUT FROM

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:39.412
SOMEONE WHO'S EXPERIENCING ALL

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:41.147
THREE IT IS BEEN A REAL PROBLEM

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.882
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:45.217
THE REALITY IS SAD REPEATING THE

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:46.852
CYCLES WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.721
ON THE STREETS CYCLE GOING IN

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.289
AND OUT OF OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS.

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:53.492
AND IN AND OUT OF OUR JAILS OVER

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.061
AND OVER AGAIN.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:56.362
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.964
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH AND

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.198
WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.766
OF SUPERVISORS THERE WERE A

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.768
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT.

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.337
THAT WE SPECIFICALLY TRIED TO

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:07.473
HELP WITH VERY LIMITED TOOLS TO

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.275
ADDRESS WHAT WE KNOW IS A REAL

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.643
CHALLENGE ONE GENTLEMAN IN

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.777
PARTICULAR.

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.512
HE WAS WELL KNOWN TO ALL THE

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.414
NEIGHBORS ALL THE MERCHANTS ALL

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:17.283
OF US THE POLICE WE ALL DID OUR

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.785
VERY BEST TO TRY AND ASSIST HIM.

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.954
BUT SADLY HE'S STILL OUT IN THE

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.223
COMMUNITY HE STILL CONTINUES TO

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.192
STRUGGLE AND IN FACT WHEN HE

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.360
GETS IS TACK AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:28.761
THE MONTH HE HAS MONEY GETS

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:30.596
TAKEN BY SOME OTHER INDIVIDUALS

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:31.630
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.933
HE HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND THIS

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.768
PARTICULAR BILL I'M FIGHTING

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.470
REALLY HARD BECAUSE I WANT TO

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:38.471
SEE HIM GET THE HELP AND THE

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:41.240
SUPPORT THAT HE NEEDS -- BUT THE

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.476
REALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:46.746
THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.447
HELP THEY DON'T NECESSARILY.

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:49.181
HAVE THE GUARDIANS THEY DON'T

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:50.883
NECESSARILY MAYBE HAVE THE

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.753
FAMILY SUPPORT -- AND SO WE WERE

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.121
VERY LIMITED AND GETTING THIS

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:57.423
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.892
SO THE ISSUES THAT HE WAS

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:01.560
CLEARLY STRUGGLING WITH WENT

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:03.529
UNTREATED AND IS CONTINUING HIS

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.431
CONDITION CONTINUES. TO

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.799
DETERIORATE.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.567
IT'S BEEN HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.536
IT WAS CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT'S

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:12.304
INVOLVED THAT HE NEEDED HELP.

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:14.206
AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO USE

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:16.042
ANYTHING THAT EXISTS IN TERMS OF

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:18.144
THE LAW TO HELP HIM OTHER THAN

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.781
WHAT WE'RE HOPING -- WILL HELP --

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.282
IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL TODAY.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.484
THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY WITH

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:27.053
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE CITY AND ITS

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.587
ON HEALTHY AND IT DOES NOT

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:29.655
ADDRESS.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:32.024
THE ROOT CAUSES AB PLAY IT

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.559
ALLOWS THEIR CONTINUED

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:34.794
CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.062
DETERIORATE.

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:37.997
AND IT PLACES A TREMENDOUS

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:41.033
FINANCIAL RESTRAINTS ON OUR

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.802
RESOURCES IN THE CITY.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:45.171
NOW WE KNOW THAT SB TEN FOUR

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:46.172
FIVE HELPS ADDRESS A CRITICAL

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:47.873
NEED IN SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE IT

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.342
DOES OFFER A WAY TO HELP SOME OF

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.411
OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS.

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:54.947
THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANY OF OUR

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.682
FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS OR

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:58.951
OURSELVES AT ANY GIVEN TIME BUT

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:00.853
OUR CURRENT LAWS MAKE IT NEARLY

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.655
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THOSE

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:05.091
INDIVIDUALS STABILIZED.

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:07.593
AND HEALTHY FOR THE LONG TERM

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.361
AND I KNOW THAT IF IT WERE ME

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.464
STRUGGLING WITH SEVERE MENTAL

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.965
ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.067
DISORDER I WOULD WANT SOMEONE TO

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.535
STEP IN AND HELP.

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:18.971
ME GT THE SUPPORT THAT I NEED

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.940
AND THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS AS

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:24.243
WE'VE WORKED ON IMPLEMENTING SB

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.544
TEN FOUR FIVE WE'VE IDENTIFIED A

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:26.912
FEW AREAS OF THAT BILL.

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:28.814
THAT NEEDS SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.317
TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SERVE THE

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:33.519
POPULATION THAT THE ORIGINAL

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.254
BILL WAS INTENDED TO SERVE.

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:37.523
SB FORTY ADVANCES THOSE

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.292
ADJUSTMENTS AND TO BE CLEAR SB

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:41.660
FORTY DOES NOT EXPAND THE

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.796
POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:46.999
ELIGIBLE FOR A HOUSING

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:48.567
CONSERVATIVES.

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:49.435
IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT NUMBER

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.637
WOULD REMAIN THE FIFTY TO

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.372
SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE THAT WE WANT

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.807
TO HELP INCLUDING THIS

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:56.575
INDIVIDUAL THAT I AM SO

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:58.410
DESPERATE TO ENSURE.

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:00.446
THAT HE GETS THE SUPPORT AND THE

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.414
HOUSING THAT HE NEEDS TO THRIVE

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:03.883
IN OUR CITY.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.584
RATHER THIS BILL REINFORCES THE

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:08.687
ORIGINAL INTENT OF SB TEN FOUR

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:09.822
FIVE THERE'S A CORE POPULATION

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:12.158
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WE CAN'T HELP

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.894
TODAY WE WANT TO HELP THROUGH A

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.362
HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP.

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:18.631
AND SB FORTY WILL HELP ENSURE

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:20.933
THAT WE CAN REACH THEM AS

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.769
DRAFTED TODAY AS BE TEN FOUR

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.171
FIVE WOULD ALLOW US TO HELP

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:26.839
FEWER THAN.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.707
FIVE INDIVIDUALS NOW I

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:31.277
UNDERSTAND THAT THE OTHER PILOT

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:33.179
COUNTIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SIMILAR

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:35.981
SMALL NUMBERS AND OUR CITY HAS A

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:37.216
LONG HISTORY.

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.718
OF PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE CARE

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.220
AND I DON'T TAKE.

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:44.056
YOU KNOW THE LIGHTLY THE IDEA OF

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.591
LIMITING SOMEONE'S CIVIL

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.426
LIBERTIES AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.527
YOU DON'T TAKE THAT LIGHTLY

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:49.595
EITHER.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.297
WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO HELP

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:53.365
PEOPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.800
WAYS AND IT IS OUR MORAL

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:57.303
OBLIGATION TO DO JUST THAT.

00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:58.637
BUT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T ACCEPT OUR

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.973
HELP AND THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.242
THEY MAY DIE ON OUR STREETS THEN

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:06.011
IT'S REALLY OUR OBLIGATION TO

00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:07.112
STEP IN.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.247
I'M HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE A

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:09.949
CHANCE TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:11.550
DIFFERENCE BY PROVIDING MUCH

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:14.086
NEEDED SERVICES TO OUR HARDEST

00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:16.982
CITIES WHERE YOU CAN GET THE

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.751
PERSON TO ACCEPT SERVICES.

00:20:19.818 --> 00:20:21.219
WE ALSO CAN'T SAY THE PEOPLE ARE

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:22.688
INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SERVICES

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:24.890
WHEN WE KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:26.391
NOT BEEN OFFERED SERVICES.

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:27.626
AND SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.361
OFFERED SERVICES HAVEN'T BEEN

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:30.829
OFFER THEM IN A COORDINATED WAY

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.297
IF YOU GET OUT OF A SUBSTANCE

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:33.465
USE PROGRAM BUT YOU STILL DON'T

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:35.200
HAVE HOUSING HOW ARE YOU GOING

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:36.535
TO BE ABLE TO STAY OFF DRUGS WE

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.103
DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.037
FOR PEOPLE.

00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:40.238
WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:41.840
CUTS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.508
AND THOSE NEED TO BE RESTORED WE

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:44.943
NEED TO BE PUTTING OUR MONEY

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.511
INTO VOLUNTARY SERVICES.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.647
BEFORE WE PUT MONEY INTO AN

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:50.082
EXTRA ADMINISTERED

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:53.752
ADMINISTRATIVE PROGRAM LAKE THIS.

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:54.953
WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF SERVICES

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.321
ARE NOT AVAILABLE IT'S

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:57.756
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET CAN SERVICE

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:59.891
PEOPLE INTO SERVICES WITHOUT

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.427
DISPLACING OTHERS WHICH MAKES IT

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:03.795
IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:04.997
SAN FRANCISCO.

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:05.964
THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.432
SUPERVISORS HAS NOT VOTED TO

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.735
IMPLEMENT SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.169
SO WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO

00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:13.739
LOOK AT AMENDING IT WITH SB.

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:15.040
FORTY WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED WITH

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.608
THE INCREASED INVOLVEMENT OF

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:18.377
POLICE AND BY TYING

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.612
CONSERVATORSHIP TO THE FIFTY ONE

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:21.980
FIFTY PROCESS THERE'S A LOT OF

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.382
ANTI HOMELESS SENTIMENT IN SAN

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:24.549

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:25.884
DESIRE TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.319
STREETS.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:28.387
AND THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO DO

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.122
IT WE DESPERATELY NEED SOME

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:32.557
PROTECTIONS AND SB TEN FORTY

AND ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.531
TREATMENT IS ONE OF THOSE WE

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:40.932
DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:42.668
CHANGE THE PROCESS WHERE THE

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:44.770
CITY CAN DECLARE THAT A PERSON

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:45.871
DOESN'T FIT A. O. T..

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:47.673
RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:51.043
PROCESS SO WE URGE YOU TO TWO

00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:53.111
POTS ON THIS LET SAN FRANCISCO

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:54.379

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:55.981
SURE PEOPLE GET THE SERVICES

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:57.115

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:01.720
AND IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:03.321
LONG RUN THAN INVOLUNTARY

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:37.562
MEMBERS -- THAT WAS A LOT OF

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:38.897
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE BILL

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:41.633
WAS LAST YEAR WE'VE MADE --

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.867
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:44.836
COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE AUTHOR

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:46.838
AND VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.239
THERE HAVE BEEN.

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:50.241
SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO

00:26:50.308 --> 00:26:52.844
THIS LEGISLATION TO TRY TO

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:53.511
PROTECT.

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:55.847
OF IN TO PRESERVE THE LPS

00:26:55.914 --> 00:26:56.982
PROCESS WHICH IS

00:26:57.048 --> 00:27:00.752
CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED -- THE

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:02.554
CONCERNS ABOUT THE LOWER IS LAW

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.422
IN THE A. O. T. EFFORT I THINK

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:06.825
WE HAVE ADDRESSED AT LEAST IN

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.827
MAJOR PORTION AND I DO KNOW THE

00:27:08.893 --> 00:27:09.694
AUTHOR IS.

00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:10.929
PREPARED TO CONTINUE THE

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:13.665
CONVERSATIONS HERE THE BILL ADD

00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:15.633
SODIUM MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.068
WHICH ARE NOW ACTUALLY

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:19.004
INCORPORATED INTO THE BILL.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.039
ADD AN OBJECTIVE STANDARD IF THE

00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:22.707
COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:25.510
DIRECTOR DOES NOT SEEK A QUARTER

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:28.646
FOR THE FOR NAY -- T. -- AND

00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:31.149
AGAIN THAT IS A PREREQUISITE TO

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:33.485
A HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP UNDER

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:35.220
SB.

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:36.021
TEN FORTY FIVE THE PRIOR VERSION

00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:37.622
OF SB A FORTY WOULD HAVE LET THE

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:39.224
DIRECTOR MAKE A DETERMINATION

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.992
WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY THAT

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:42.727
WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE SO WE'VE

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:47.265
ADDED OBJECTIVE FACTORS TO THAT.

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:48.433
I THAN COULD GO INTO DETAIL ITEM

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.402
BY ITEM BY ITEM -- LET ME JUST

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:52.203
SUGGEST THAT THIS IS STILL A

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.372
WORK IN PROGRESS BUT I WOULD SAY

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:56.341
THAT -- THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT

00:27:56.408 --> 00:27:58.143
HAVE BEEN TAKEN THE WORK THAT'S

00:27:58.209 --> 00:27:58.977
BEEN DONE I THINK.

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:00.912
WE'LL PUT THIS IN A POSITION

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:03.948
THAT IT DOES -- ADEQUATELY

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:07.152
ADDRESS LPS ISSUES AND LIKE SO

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:09.120
MUCH OTHER WONDERFUL WORK WE DO

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:11.189
IT IF THE OPPOSITION ISN'T

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:12.757
PLEASE WITH THAT THEY'LL.

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:13.925
THEY'LL BRING.

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:15.360
IN ALL SUIT AND WILL END UP

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:17.262
PERHAPS AGAIN WITH THE STATE

00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:18.696
SUPREME COURT MAKING THAT

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:21.399
DECISION BUT I THINK UNDER THE

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:24.936
CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'VE DONE A A

00:28:25.003 --> 00:28:26.738
VERY FINE JOB MAKING THIS.

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:28.706
A MUCH LESS HARPER AND THEN I

00:28:28.773 --> 00:28:30.475
FELT LAST YEAR WHEN WE DID AGREE

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.210
TO MAKE THIS A PILOT BUT I THINK

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:33.244
THIS DOES.

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:36.414
IMPROVE UPON IT AND A WE HAVE A

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:37.749
MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.250
CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.

00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:40.819
AS FAR AS THE COMMENTS ABOUT

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:41.920
MENTAL HEALTH AND I APPRECIATE

00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:42.887
HER FOR THE MAYOR SAY THE SAME

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:43.521
THING.

00:28:43.588 --> 00:28:45.323
WE'RE NOT DOING AN ADEQUATE JOB

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.691
ON DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:47.492
PERIOD.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.927
WHETHER IT'S OUR YOUNGSTERS WHO

00:28:48.993 --> 00:28:50.929
ARE OUT THERE ARE EXPRESSING

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:54.199
SUICIDAL IDEATION AT THE AGES OF

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:55.366
NINE TO THOSE WHO ARE IN THEIR

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:57.068
EARLY AND PRETEEN YEARS

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:58.803
COMMITTING SUICIDE.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.472
A TO OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:03.741
THOSE OF OUR YOUTH THE THE WHOLE --

00:29:03.808 --> 00:29:05.043
MENTALITY.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.946
ALL OF OUR POPULATION HIT HIS

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:09.414
SUFFERING FROM SEVERE.

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:11.716
STRESS AND AND EVEN MENTAL

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:13.384
HEALTH ISSUES AND IT IS.

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:14.953
ABOUT TIME WE TOOK THIS IS A

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.688
VERY VERY SERIOUS A PUBLIC

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.223
HEALTH PROBLEM.

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:19.824
THAT BEING SAID THOUGH THERE ARE

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:22.894
SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW TRULY AT

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:24.596
THAT DANGEROUS TIPPING POINT AND

00:29:24.662 --> 00:29:26.564
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.967
TRIES TO ADDRESS -- WE DO KNOW

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:30.768
THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.971
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS COME

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:35.240
OUT OF I THINK IT WAS --

00:29:35.306 --> 00:29:38.510
PROPOSITION -- SIXTY THREE THAT

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:41.412

FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:44.616
AND I AM CONFIDENT SAN FRANCISCO

00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:46.951
IS -- IN THE FOREFRONT ON THAT

00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:48.987
LOS ANGELES HAS AN ENORMOUS

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:50.722
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT.

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:52.290
IS SITTING THERE WE HAVE TO ASK

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:54.392
WHY THAT IS BUT THAT'S NOT THE

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.927
BILL HERE TODAY -- WHAT WE'RE

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:59.164
LOOKING AT HERE'S HOW TO TAKE

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.266
THE MOST SEVERELY -- MENTALLY

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:02.901
ILL FOLKS AND GIVE THEM

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:04.836
TREATMENT OR PUT THEM INTO SOME

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:07.405
KIND OF PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:09.040
TO TRY TO HELP THEM.

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:11.609
AND SO ARE YOU -- AGAIN WANT TO

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:13.444

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:20.318
OF FOR WORKING VERY VERY HARD ON

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:22.754
THIS BILL I GENERALLY I DON'T

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.856
LIKE TO CHANGE SOMETHING BEFORE

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:26.457
IT'S EVEN BEEN PUT INTO PLAY.

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:28.593
BUT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND I

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.361
THINK THIS WAS ONE OF THEM -- SO

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.197
I I WANTED TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.731
BECAUSE WE DID TRUST AMEND THIS

00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:35.867
BILL LAST WEEK IT IS IN PRINT

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:36.768
HOWEVER.

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:38.937
GIVEN THE PUBLIC AN OPPORTUNITY

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:41.873
TO SPEAK AND I THINK THERE ARE A

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.840
LOT OF CONCERNS.

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:44.409
THAT ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:46.477
THAT -- WE CAN CAN TRIGGER

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:48.413
CONTINUE TO TRY TO ADDRESS GOING

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:49.647
FORWARD AND I HAVE EVERY

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:51.182
CONFIDENCE SENATOR WINNER HE

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:52.951
WILL DO THAT SO -- IF THERE ARE

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.819
ANY QUESTIONS WE'LL START WITH

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:57.388
SENATOR BORCHARD SHIN AND TO

00:30:57.455 --> 00:31:00.892

THIS TO OUR ATTENTION IS A VERY

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:09.467
CHALLENGING ISSUE.

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.401
WOULD YOU CONSIDER GETTING

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:12.804
ORANGE COUNTY AS FOR THE PILOT

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:13.071
PROJECT.

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:13.571

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:14.739
SAID THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.708

WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED AS BE

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:20.378

SAN DIEGO -- AND SO -- WELL I

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:40.565
THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:42.900
REASONABLE CONVERSATION TO HAVE

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.602

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:46.104

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:53.211
COUNTIES -- AND YES I IT'S A

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:54.846

ORANGE COUNTY AND I'M NOT

00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:05.657
PREPARED TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:06.524
THE AGREEMENT.

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.393
THAT WE STRUCK WITH THE

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:10.895
COMMITTEE LAST YEAR TO NARROW IT

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:16.668
TO NOT BE OFFICE THAT IS AT A

00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:20.004
MAYBE -- NO.

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:22.040
YOUR AYE AYE I'M NOT PREPARED TO

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:25.009
MAKE THAT AMENDMENT -- SENATOR.

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:25.677
WELL A PART OF THE PROBLEM IS SO

00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:26.344
THAT THE BILL THAT WE NEED BY IN

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:26.944
FROM THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:27.612
WE ARE ASKING THEM TO DO A LOT.

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:28.212
AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:30.048
EXPEND THE RESOURCES AND WHAT WE

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:31.616
WANTED TO DO IS FIRST.

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:33.384
SEE IF THIS IF THIS COULD WORK

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:35.787
THIS IS A AN ELEGANT I THINK

00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:38.756
EFFORT TO TRY TO THREAD A NEEDLE --

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.725

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.998
IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL IT WILL

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:49.734
EXPAND AND SHOULD EXPAND.

THAT WERE.

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.856
THAT WERE MADE NOT BY THE

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:14.225

HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES.

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.166
THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS NO DOUBT

00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:23.968
ABOUT THAT THE SAFETY NET IS NOT

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.036
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.

BUT TO TO TO SUGGEST WALKING

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:28.406

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:30.041
YOU CAN'T GET THOSE VOLUNTARY

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:31.175

IN SAN FRANCISCO ON IT IS THAT

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:36.080
THAT IS SO IT'S INACCURATE IN

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.148
THE EXTREME.

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.249
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:39.784
TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.185
MOST IN CRISIS.

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:42.653
PEOPLE WHO RIGHT NOW WE ARE

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.222

THEIR CYCLING THROUGH OUR

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.759
EMERGENCY ROOM ON A REGULAR

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:49.660
BASIS CYCLING THROUGH OUR JAILS.

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:51.396
THE VOLUNTARY SERVICES ARE

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:52.997
AVAILABLE FOR THIS SMALL

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:54.999
UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.968
BUT THEY ARE NOT CAPABLE OF

00:33:57.034 --> 00:33:58.369
ACCESSING IT BECAUSE OF THE

00:33:58.436 --> 00:33:59.804
CONDITION THAT THERE AND O I

TAKE ISSUE.

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:02.340
WITH THAT STATEMENT BUT THIS IS

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:03.708
JUST WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:07.512
CONCERT PEOPLE CONSERVATORSHIP.

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:11.048
THE LAST RESORT -- I ALSO --

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:12.850
THERE THERE WAS A SUGGESTION

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:14.352
THAT E SHOULD.

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:15.520
THAT BECAUSE THE SAN FRANCISCO

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:17.088
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HASN'T

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:19.457
VOTED TO OPT ANYA THAT WE SHOULD

00:34:19.524 --> 00:34:21.559

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:27.999
THE TEMPORARY.

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:30.668
FIVE IS BECAUSE IT ONLY AFFECTS

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.437
A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND SO

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:33.838
IT'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR US TO

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.573
ACTUALLY OFTEN AND SO NOW WE'RE

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.741
TRYING TO FIX IT SO THAT IT WILL

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:38.443
REACH THE UNIVERSE THAT WE WANT

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:39.277
TO REACH AND THEN THEY COME UP

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:40.278

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:05.703
THEIR PEERS.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:06.570
ALSO ALTHOUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:07.371
LIMóN STILL FROM LAST YEAR WAS

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:08.239
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THAT IT

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:09.306
CLARIFIED.

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.574
CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW THAT

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:11.375
THE SPACE COULD NOT BE A

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:13.244
BATHROOM IT SIMPLY DID NOT GO

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.445
FAR ENOUGH.

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.579
INDEED AS A COMMITTEE NOW SAYS

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.581
POINTED OUT IT WAS ALREADY A

00:40:17.648 --> 00:40:18.649
FEDERAL LAW THAT COULD NOT BE A

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.584
BATHROOM AND WE THINK WOMEN

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:21.886
DESERVE MORE SUPPORT FROM THAT.

00:40:21.952 --> 00:40:22.987
AT LEGAL AID AT WORK WE HAVE A

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:24.054
WORKING FAMILY HELP LINE WHERE

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:25.156

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.858
STRUGGLING WITH THESE ISSUES AND

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:28.492
I JUST WANT TO SHARE THE STORY

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.628
OF ONE SHE WAS A SERVER IN A

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:31.662
RESTAURANT.

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:33.197
WHEN SHE RETURNED TO WORK SHE

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.532
ASKED FOR LACTATION COMBINATIONS

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:35.866
THE ONLY PLACE THEY OFFERED HER

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:37.568
IT WAS A STORAGE AREA WHEN NO

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:38.869
PLACE TO SAY?

00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:40.638
NO PLACE TO PUT THE BOMB TO PLUG

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:42.072
IN THE PUMP -- SO WHEN SHE

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.874
TALKED TO EMPLOYER AND ASK FOR

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:45.276

RISKING HER FINANCIAL SECTOR

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:49.914
SECURITY BY LEAVING.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.915
NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO MAKE

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:52.416
THAT CHOICE AND SB ONE FORTY TWO

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:53.784

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:54.618
REALITY.

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:28.499
YES GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN

SEVEN OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR.

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:34.805

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:48.619
TRUE TODAY.

00:44:48.685 --> 00:44:49.987
I'M NOT ONLY DOES THIS BILL

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.255
REQUIRE EXTREME BUILDING CODE

00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:53.123

BETWEEN THIRTY THOUSAND AND A

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:55.592
HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:56.827
DOLLARS FOR AN EMPLOYER -- AS

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:57.861

THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:01.165
MAINTENANCE IT ALSO IS

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.533
UNNECESSARILY DUPLICATIVE OF

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.501
PROTECTIONS ARE ALREADY PROVIDED

00:45:04.568 --> 00:45:05.035
UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:06.270
HOUSING LAW.

00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:07.304
WITH REGARD -- TO RECORD

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.640
DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:11.508
FOR LACTATION LACTATING MOTHERS.

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:12.576
AND THE CONCERN THERE IS THAT

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:13.310
THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.778

FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT AND

00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:20.617
THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR TO

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:21.985
ESSENTIALLY -- DIFFERENT

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:23.287
PREPARED DIFFERENT

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:25.389
ADMINISTRATIVE -- AUTHORITY ON

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:26.890
THIS SO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:27.624
COULD COME OUT WITH THEIR OWN

00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:29.059
AUTHORITY ON THIS AS WELL AS THE

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:29.660
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:31.361
HOUSING AND EMPLOYERS WOULD NOT

KNOW WHICH ONE THEY NEED TO

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:32.930
FOLLOW.

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:34.631
ADDITIONALLY IT EXPANDS EMPLOYER

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:36.600
CIVIL LIABILITY AND THERE'S ALSO

TO CREATE THAT FLEXIBILITY AND

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.527
WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:12.896
COLLABORATIVELY TOGETHER -- DAY

YOU'RE BUILDING OR RENOVATING

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:24.107
ABOVE A CERTAIN SQUARE FOOTAGE.

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:26.877
YOU HAVE TO PLAN FOR IT -- THE

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:29.479
ONLYDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BILL

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:30.146
THAT'S BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:32.749
TODAY -- AND WHAT WAS VETOED

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:34.885
LAST YEAR IS THE BUILDING

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:36.987
CORPORATE SENATOR SMALL MINOR

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:40.056
TECHNICALS -- DIFFERENCES BUT

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:40.857
THAT WAS NOT IN THE BILL THAT

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:42.225
WAS VETOED IT WAS TAKEN OUT IN

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:43.827
THE COURSE OF LEGISLATION LAST

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.128
YEAR AS WAS DEPRIVE RIGHT OF

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:45.629
ACTION.

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:46.897
WITH BOTH OF THOSE BACK IN

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:48.765
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THEM -- THE

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:49.699
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS NOW

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:51.935
OUT AGAIN -- BUT THE BUILDING

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.837
CODE IS STILL AN BUT EVERYTHING

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.972
ELSE AND I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:58.108
BY THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE IT --

00:52:58.174 --> 00:52:59.409
IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT THIS IS

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:00.810
SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT BILL

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:02.479
OTHER THAN HAVING THE BUILDING

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:08.685
CODE THANK YOU FOR THE

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:09.653
CLARIFICATION IN.

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:11.054
MADAM CHAIR MADE REFERENCE TO A

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:11.588
MAN ON THE MOON WITH THIS

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:12.856
PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION FOR FEMALE

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.925
ASTRONAUT SIR IS THAT UNDER

00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:15.892
FEDERAL LAW ONLY.

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:16.426
WELL THAT MIGHT READ MEET

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:16.960
RESISTANCE FROM THE SAME

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:18.495
OPPONENTS HERE BUT HOPEFULLY BY

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:19.396
THAT TIME.

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:21.431
WE WILL HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:22.866
DAY THAT THIS IS NOT THAT

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.834
DIFFICULT IT'S JUST A QUESTION

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:26.603
OF PRIORITIZING WOULD HAVE TO

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.939
NEGOTIATE WITH NASA ON THAT ONE

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:32.242
I THINK IT'S TRUE IS NASA STILL

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:34.778
IN EFFECT AND AT ANY RATE --

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:36.813
THANK YOU AND QUESTION CENTER

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.781
WHITE CASKET.

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:38.415
THE I THINK THE TRIGGER ON THE

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:39.416
REMODEL IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:40.550
DOLLARS CAN YOU GIVE ME THE

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:42.552
BENEFIT OF YOUR THINKING ON DAD

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:44.120
SINCE MY WIFE AND I JUST

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:46.056
REMODELED OUR HOUSE ACROSS IS A

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:46.823
QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.626
SO MY CONCERN IS THAT FIVE

00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:50.994
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:52.829
OFFICE BUILDING IS.

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:55.065
I AM JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:58.902
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING AS YOU KNOW

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:02.439
I THINK WE THE TERM WHICH WE

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:03.173
WERE TRYING TO DO IS BALANCE

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:05.208
THAT THERE IS THERE IS A COST

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:07.911
INVOLVED -- AND SO THERE'S A

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:10.580
CERTAIN -- A THRESHOLD AND ONE

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:12.616
COULD ARGUE IT SHOULD BE FOUR

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:14.050
HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SIX HUNDRED

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:14.951
THOUSAND AND I'M LOOKING IS A

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:17.721
MAGIC NUMBER -- BUT WE THOUGHT

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:20.190
THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS A

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:21.191
SIGNIFICANT IN OFFICE --

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:22.158
RENOVATION THAT WOULD BE

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:24.361
APPROPRIATE TO DO AND AGAIN IT'S

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:28.298
NOT.

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:30.600
IT'S NOT LIKE A MONUMENTAL.

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.035
THING THAT HAS TO BE BUILT INTO

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:32.936
IT IT'S JUST.

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:34.971
WHILE YOU'RE DOING -- NEARLY

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:36.840

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.711
MAY PUT ONE AND IT'S FOR THE

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.146
REQUIREMENTS IS BILL.

AND NEARBY RUNNING WATER WHICH

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:48.585
COULD BE A SINK NOT EVEN A FULL

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:50.120
BATHROOM NEARBY RUNNING WATER

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:51.321
NEARBY.

REFRIGERATOR WHICH COULD BE A

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.624
SMALL LITTLE MINI FRIDGE --

00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:57.360
SERVICE AND PRIVACY SO YOU THIS

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:59.062
IS NOT.

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:01.998
A COMPLICATED.

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:05.001

THAT SAYS PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB.

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:17.414
I MEAN THIS THIS IS NOT THE

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.883
ROCKET SCIENCE TO PUT A A WOMAN

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:00.890
COMPLEX.

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:02.392

BLOCKING A CALL THAT WE SHOULD

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.541
HAVE OTHERWISE THROUGH.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.510
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE A

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.345

AGGRESSIVELY AT THE FEDERAL

LEVEL AS THE ANALYSIS YOU KNOW I

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:40.496

CAN BE USEFUL SO WE HAVE TO BE

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.141
CAREFUL.

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:53.376
THAT IT THIS SAYS THIS

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.077
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GOING TO BE AN

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.979
EXACT SCIENCE -- IT IS AN

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.215
ALGORITHM WHERE OF SAY OKAY IT

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:01.050

THE CUSTOMER SHOWS ABOUT THEIR

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.990
PHONE THAT THIS IS PROBABLY A

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:10.926
SCAM CALL -- AND THE CUSTOMER

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.695
WILL THEN NOT TAKE THE CALL AND

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.063
IS MS MCINTYRE INDICATED

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.631
SOMETIMES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.966
CREATE A PROBLEM.

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:19.135
WE ARE WORKING WITH A TECHNOLOGY

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:24.206

THE END OF THIS YEAR -- THERE

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:31.113

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.084
PEOPLE.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.652
IT WOULD CREATE A PATCHWORK OF

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:37.953
STATE LAWS AND ENFORCEMENT ON A

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.655

FOUND A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:29.184
AND CANADA IS IS LEADING THE

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:30.419

THAT DATE?

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.628
I DON'T KNOW WHY AREN'T THE

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.063
WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING IT NOW

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:15.330
WITHOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT I DON'T

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:16.765
KNOW EITHER.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:20.703
IF 40% OF EVERY CALL BEEN ISSUED.

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:22.471
A BEING BEING TRANSPARENT OUR

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:23.439
PHONES.

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:25.207
IS NOT SEEN AS AN ENORMOUS

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:26.842
PROBLEM.

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:28.210

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:35.851
IF I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST

A AND AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:38.887
CAN LOOK INTO THIS FOR YOURSELF

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.689
IF I THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD NOT

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:41.990
DO THIS.

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:45.894
BY -- JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:46.695
KNOW I WOULD NOT PLAY BUT HE'S

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.130
SUCH A HARD DATE BUT THIS IS

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.032
SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY OUT

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.834
THERE AND THEY'VE EVEN COUNTED

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:52.334
WHAT Y..

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:53.569
SHAKEN AND STIRS ARE ALREADY

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:55.938
DEVELOPING BETTER TECHNOLOGIES

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:57.606
AND SAKE SHAKEN SERVE WELL

01:12:57.673 --> 01:12:59.408
THAT'S IN THE BILL.

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:00.375
SHAKEN -- SERVERS OR SOMETHING

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.544
MORE EFFECTIVE.

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:06.315
AND AGAIN OF I UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:07.716
ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES THEM TO

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:09.685
DO ANYTHING IS NOT SOMETHING

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:10.619
THEY'LL AGREE TO IN ANY

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:13.155
CIRCUMSTANCE EVEN IF IT'S

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.623
SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD.

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:15.157
YOU KNOW I JUST.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.359
I I I THEY'RE NOT OPPOSE I DON'T

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.627
THINK THEY'RE OPPOSED TO TO

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:19.528
DOING THIS THEY'RE JUST SUPPOSED

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:20.395
TO HAVE BEEN A LAW.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.464
IN THE BOOKS THAT THEY SEE AS A

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:24.366
LIABILITY TO THEM AND I

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:25.801
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW IF.

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:26.702
IF I WERE IN THEIR SHOES I'D

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:29.972
PROBABLY DO THE SAME THING I I'M

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:31.874
NOT CRITICIZING THEM AT ALL.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.543
BUT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.245
THEY'LL THEY'LL HAVE TO DEAL

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:36.645
WITH.

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:38.147
IT IN. FOR US TO BASICALLY

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:41.416
ACHIEVE SOME LEVEL OF SANITY.

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:43.318
IN OUR IN OUR PHONE SYSTEM THIS

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.220
IS A MAJOR ISSUE WHEN PEOPLE

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:47.022
START TO IGNORE PHONE CALLS AT

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.157
THE RECEIVING.

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:50.626
OR REQUEST WERE IGNORING CALLS.

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:52.928
FROM -- LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THEIR

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.229
SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY HAVE OVER

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.464
THERE FREIGHTED IT.

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.299
IT JUST CREATES THIS THIS CHAOS

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.034
AND OUR PHONE SYSTEM IT'S

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.502
LITTERED WITH UNCERTAINTY IT

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:03.138
REDUCES THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:04.506
IN A TECHNOLOGY THAT.

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.442
HE IS IS ONE OF THE IS BECOMING

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.510
ONE OF THEIR LARGEST MONTHLY

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:09.845
BILLS.

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:11.113
AND I JUST THINK WE CAN DO.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.881
SOMETHING BETTER IN CALIFORNIA

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:19.521
IF CANADA IS DOING THE-SUCCESSFULLY WHY CAN'T WE TRY.

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:20.923
BUT CERTAINLY THE LARGEST

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.392
MONTHLY BILLS WOULD MEAN WELL OF

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:24.626
THE YOUR YOUR LEFT CELL PHONE

01:14:24.693 --> 01:14:26.862
BILLS ARE ARE PRETTY LARGE.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.063
CELL PHONE BILLS ARE BECOMING

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.631
VERY VERY BIG BECAUSE MOST

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:32.000
PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE CONDUCTING

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.703
THEIR RIGHT OKAY BUSINESS.

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.138
ON PHONES -- A PHONE IS NOT JUST

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.607
A PHONE ANYMORE IT'S YOU KNOW

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.108
IT'S IT'S A C. P. U. OF OUR

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.577
LIVES.

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:43.312
AND AND IT'S BECOME ALMOST

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:46.715
ESSENTIAL TO EVERYBODY'S.

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:48.050
DAILY LIVES AND AND HAVING 40%

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:49.785
OF EVERY I JUST CAN'T GET OVER

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:50.652
THAT NUMBER.

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:52.454
WE CAN DO BETTER WE SHOULD TRY

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.257
AND I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:58.193
BUT THE IDEA IS THIS CAN BE DONE

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:58.827
WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT WE WE

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.262
HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS BUT

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.631
I JUST LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:03.165
ATTENTION AND WE'LL GO TO

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:03.799
SENATOR STERN.

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:07.169
THERE WAS A SUGGESTION OF BY I

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:09.538
FORGET WHAT PART OF THE INDUSTRY --

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.974
THAT THEY HAD TO CONCERNS ONE IS

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.175
THEY DON'T REALLY LIKE THE P.

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.576
YOU SEE DOING THIS AND I'M NOT

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:15.644
SURE THIS ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:18.080
IS OVERWHELMINGLY DELIGHTED WITH

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:18.447
THE WORK THAT.

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:20.015
YOU SEE THESE DAYS WOULD YOU

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:23.252
WOULD YOU CONSIDER OR OR A

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.887
PLEDGE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:28.624
SOME ALTERNATIVE ON ENFORCEMENT.

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.325
AND THEN ALSO ADDRESS AND I'D BE

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:30.926
GLAD TO WORK WITH YOU AS WELL

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:32.094
GREAT AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.962
THE LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.231
IMPROPERLY BLOCKED CALLS WOULD

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:37.733
YOU ALSO AGREE TO CONTINUE

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:38.867
WORKING.

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:41.103
ON ON THAT TO THE TO THAT

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.404
THERE'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:43.805
MIGHT NEED TO MEET.

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.908
ANYBODY THE BILL PERFECT I

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:47.042
THOUGHT THERE WAS A REAL

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:49.111
LIABILITY OF THEM BLOCKING CALLS

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.479
THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:52.681
BLOCKING AND THAT'S AGAIN OKAY

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:54.449
THEIR MESSAGE JEAN.

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:57.019
IS IS IS I UNDERSTAND TO CONFUSE

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:58.687
AND SO IF THAT'S SO THEN THAT

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.956
ISN'T AN ISSUE BUT I THINK THOSE

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:01.423
WERE.

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.692
TO IT WAS CONSIDERED CONCERNS

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.127
THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE I THINK

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.695
SOME RESIDENTS HERE AND IF YOU

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:08.163
KEEP WORKING ON THAT THAT'S ALL

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.798
THAT'S ALL I'D ASK A WORKING

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:10.699
SOLVE IN ANY PART OF THE BILL.

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.100
BUT I WON'T WORK ON SOLVING A

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:13.302
PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST I

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:23.946
THAT SENATOR STERN

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:25.480
MANAGER MAYBE JUST BUILDING ON

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:27.282
THAT.

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:28.183
WHAT WHAT ARE THE LIGHT WHAT

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.051
WOULD THEY BE LIABLE WHAT WITH

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:30.419
THE TELL BECAUSE BE LIABLE FOR

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:31.687
UNDER THIS LIKE HOW HOW DO HOW

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:32.321
DOES THE ENFORCEMENT WORKERS I'M

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:33.555
SEEING?

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:34.456
I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.157
IT'S AUTHORIZING.

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:37.225
THE AG TO PROSECUTE ACTIONS FOR

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:38.694
VIOLATIONS AND THEN THERE'S

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.162
HANDLE TEAS.

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:42.030
SO THE THE ENFORCEABLE COME FROM

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:44.132

WOULD ENFORCEAND WHAT WE TRY.

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:48.337
TO TRIGGER THAT ENFORCEMENTCAN

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.572
YOU NOW AGAIN THE BILL ALL THE

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:53.442
BILL DOES IS REQUIRE THEM.

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.177

IDENTIFICATION AUTHENTICATION

01:16:57.813 --> 01:16:58.747
SYSTEM.

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.015
THAT.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.516
IT DOESN'T SAY.

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:02.584
THAT IT HAS TO AFFECTED REALLY

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:05.554
BLOCK EVERY SINGLE CALL DOESN'T

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.689
SAY THAT BUT IT IS THAT --

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:14.029
SHAKEN STIRS IS IS TO FIND.

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:15.263
AND IT IT'S ALREADY -- THEY'LL

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.398
EVEN SAY WERE WERE USING SOME OF

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:19.701
THESE PROGRAMS ALREADY -- AND

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:21.003
AND SOME ARE AVAILABLE TO

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:23.472
CONSUMERS CHICKEN SISTERS AS A

CALLER I. AUTHENTICATION

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:26.475
PROTOCOL THAT USES COMPUTER PRAG

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.477
PROGRAMMING. TO DETERMINE IF THE

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.812
CALLER HAS BEEN SPOOFED THE

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:32.514
PROGRAM IN THE PROGRAMMING IS

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.182
EMBEDDED INTO TELECOMMUNICATION

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:35.751
NETWORK CONTROLS.

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.786
AND USES INFORMATION ABOUT THE

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:41.423
WHICH THE CALL IS LIKELY SPOOFED.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.958
THE SOFTWARE CAN DETERMINE THE

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:43.859
FOLLOWING.

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:48.463
THE CALLER ID IS FULLY VERIFIED --

A CALLER ID IT IS REGISTERED

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:55.037
WITH THE A CARRIER FROM WHICH IT

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.805
IS PLACING THE CALL -- THE

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:59.741
SOURCE OF THE CALL IS IDENTIFIED.

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:01.510

CALLER IS AUTHORIZED TO USE A

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.846
CALLER ID SO FREQUENTLY.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.314
THIS OCCURS WHEN BUSINESSES HAVE

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:07.482
MANY INTERNET PHONE LINE TO

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:10.118
SHARE THE SAME TELECOM TRUNK FOR

THE THE PROBE IT GOES ON TO KIND

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:15.023
OF DESCRIBE.

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.258
THAT.

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:18.660
ARE THERE IT THERE IS A SYSTEM

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.362
FOR TRYING TO SEPARATE CALLS

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:23.398
THAT HAVE BEEN DIGITIZED AND

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:23.632
BETTER.

01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:25.200
SO.

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:26.101
THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS FOR SURE

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:29.204
AND ALL THE BILL REQUIRE.

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:29.771
IS THAT THEY IMPLEMENT THIS

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:31.773
TECHNOLOGY.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.241
SIMPLE SO THEY'D BE THEY'D BE

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:33.742

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.377
WOULD IF THEY DIDN'T TAKE A SHOT

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.179
AT IMPLEMENTING IT RIGHT THEY'RE

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.414
NOT LIABLE IF IT'S BASED ON THE

BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL A GOOD

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:39.446
YEAR.

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:40.681
BASICALLY TO THAT SHOW.

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:42.516
WHAT HAPPENS IS WE'VE GOT THIS

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.618
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:46.754
PROCESS WHEN SOMEBODY -- IS A

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:49.423
WHISTLE BLOWER AND THE NUMBER OF

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:51.325
DAYS IT TAKES IT HAS TAKEN

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:52.660
HISTORICALLY FOR THEIR CASES

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:54.461
EVEN BE HEARD THE IMPACT ON THE

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:01.335
OR SAFETY ISSUE ON THE JOB?

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:02.936
IS PUT IN HARM'S WAY THEIR

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:04.371
FAMILY WITHOUT.

01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:05.973
OFTEN WITHOUT PAY AND SO A

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.508
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE DID A

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:09.543
MEASURE IN THIS HERE THAT

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:11.512
BASICALLY DID TOO BROAD THINGS

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:12.946
ONE GAVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF POWER

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:14.248
WHERE THERE WAS OVERWHELMING

01:39:14.315 --> 01:39:16.450
EVIDENCE FOR THE LABOR

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:18.352
COMMISSIONER TO PROCEED.

01:39:18.419 --> 01:39:20.020
AND SECONDLY TO OUR GAVE THE

01:39:20.087 --> 01:39:21.689
LABOR COMMISSIONER POWER TO

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:23.757
ISSUE CITATIONS AND PENALTIES

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:25.359
DIRECTLY TO ENFORCE.

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.261
RETALIATORY CLAIMS WERE

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:28.429
WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS.

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:29.930
BUT IN THE PROCESS AND THE

01:39:29.997 --> 01:39:31.332
REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY IS

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:33.000
OFTEN THE CASE IN.

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.335
THE LAWS ALL OF WHEN THE HOME

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:36.503
SAYS THE LIFE OF THE LAW HAS NOT

01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:37.871
BEEN LOGIC IT'S BEEN EXPERIENCE.

01:39:37.938 --> 01:39:38.872
AND THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE

01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:40.507
LEARNED IS THAT THERE'S KIND OF

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:43.544
A HOLE IN THAT PROCESS THE THE

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:44.445
CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW THE

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:45.312
LABOR COMMISSION OF THE LABOR

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:46.447
COMMISSIONER DETERMINES.

01:39:46.513 --> 01:39:49.116
SECTION NINETY EIGHT POINT SEVEN

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:50.317
FOUR AFTER INVESTIGATION THAT

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:51.885
THERE'S A VIOLATION.

01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:53.120
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER SHOWER

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:55.122
WITH REGIONAL POMPOUS ISSUE

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.923
CITATION.

01:39:55.989 --> 01:39:57.491
THERE IS A RIGHT IN THIS BILL

01:39:57.558 --> 01:39:59.159
FOR SOMEONE TO REQUEST A HEARING

01:39:59.226 --> 01:39:59.860
WITHIN THE CASE WHERE THEY

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:00.527
HAVEN'T.

01:40:00.594 --> 01:40:03.030
THIS IS WHERE THIS BILL FILLED

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:03.997
THE WHOLE.

01:40:04.064 --> 01:40:05.099
IT SAYS IF NO HEARING IS

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:06.133
REQUESTED TO PURSUANT TO

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.334
PARAGRAPH ONE TO WHICH I JUST

01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:23.550
REFERRED

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:32.459
.

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:33.694
A CERTIFIED COPY THE CITATION

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:34.928
MAY BE FILED WITH THE LABOR

01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:36.096
COMMISSIONER IN THE OFFICE OF

01:40:36.163 --> 01:40:38.031
THE CLERK OF THE SUPERIOR COURT.

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:56.316
THEN THERE COULD BE AND IN FORCE

01:41:21.308 --> 01:41:22.443
WE BELIEVED AND STILL BELIEVE

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:23.877
THAT WE DO WE REALLY NEED TO

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:24.445
TAKE SOME GREATER STEPS TO

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:25.746
BETTER PROTECT WORKERS FROM

01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:28.449
RETALIATION -- THE PROCESS BY

01:41:28.515 --> 01:41:30.384
LARGE WORKS WELL BUT IT TAKES A

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:31.752
VERY LONG TIME MAKE IT TAKES UP

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:33.787
TO ABOUT THREE YEARS FOR WORKERS.

01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:34.855
TO GET ANY KIND OF RELIEF WHEN

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.590
THAT RETALIATION HAPPENS

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:37.724
FOLLOWING IN THEIR DECISION TO

01:41:37.791 --> 01:41:39.126
REPORT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:42.162
AND WHILE WE DO STAND BY THREE

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.729
OH SIX IT DID TURN OUT THERE

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:43.497
WERE A FEW AREAS IN THE BILL

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.599
THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM SOME

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:46.967
GREATER CLARITY.

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:49.102
HERTZBERG COVER THOSE -- IT ALSO

01:41:49.169 --> 01:41:50.704
WE THINK MAKES IT PRETTY BUT WE

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:51.672
THINK IT'LL IN SOME WAYS REDUCE

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:52.906
THE LITIGATION IN THE SYSTEM

01:41:52.973 --> 01:41:55.142
BECAUSE THE THE PROCESS

01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:56.710
ENVISIONED BY SB.

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:57.678
THREE OH SIX DIDN'T GIVE ALL OF

01:41:57.744 --> 01:41:59.847
THE THE WORKERS A DEAL IS

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:01.548
EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED TO JUST

01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:02.616
ENFORCE THE CITATION AS IT

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:04.751
STANDS IT LIKELY REQUIRES THE

01:42:04.818 --> 01:42:05.919
FILING OF A LAWSUIT WHEN THAT'S

01:42:05.986 --> 01:42:07.421
NOT REALLY NECESSARY AND SO WE

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:08.322
THINK.

01:42:08.388 --> 01:42:09.189
THIS BILL WILL TAKE A LOT OF

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:11.024
THAT UNNECESSARY LITIGATION OUT

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:12.493
OF THE SYSTEM -- IT MAKES A FEW

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:13.660
OTHER CHANGES THAT WE THINK

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:15.362
WE'LL BOTH PROTECT DUE PROCESS

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:16.630
FOR EMPLOYERS BUT MAKE IT

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:17.898
SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE A LITTLE

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:18.899
BIT MORE FAMILIAR WITH IT LOOKS

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:19.399
LIKE.

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:21.034
THE PROCESS THAT EXISTS FOR

01:42:21.101 --> 01:42:22.035
OTHER TYPES OF CLAIMS BEFORE

01:42:22.102 --> 01:42:24.805
DEAL ESSIE AND OVERALL WE THINK

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:26.473
IT IS A LOT OF CHANGE IT

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.307
PRESENTS A LOT OF CHANGES THAT

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:31.545
WE THINK MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:33.046
BETTER WE URGE OUR SPORT.

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:34.248

EVEN AS I TRY MY HARDEST TO

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:44.384
THOUSAND AT NO POINT HAVE I HAD

01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:45.718
THE FUNDS TO PAY THIS JUDGMENT.

01:53:45.785 --> 01:53:46.686
MY ACCOUNT WAS FIRST LOVE IT I

01:53:49.022 --> 01:53:49.589
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED IN THE ACCOUNT

01:53:49.656 --> 01:53:50.623
WAS TAKEN.

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:51.991
AN ADDITIONAL FEE WAS ADOPTED SO

01:53:52.058 --> 01:53:53.927
I HAD TO PAY THE BANK FIFTY

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:55.195
DOLLARS BEFORE I CAN EVEN ACCESS

01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:56.529
MY ACCOUNT AGAIN.

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:58.231
THE LOSS OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED WAS

01:53:58.298 --> 01:53:59.799
UNTHINKABLE AND MAN I COULDN'T

NOW THE LOSS OF FIFTY DOLLARS

01:54:03.136 --> 01:54:03.970
MEANS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:54:04.037 --> 01:54:05.371
WHETHER OR NOT I CAN AFFORD

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:06.406
GROCERIES.

01:54:06.472 --> 01:54:07.473

AS RESULT OF THE STRESS.

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:13.680
I DECIDED TO CAREFULLY READ

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:15.014
THROUGH ALL THE PAPERWORK AND

01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:16.249
REALIZE THAT MY MONEY MIGHT BE

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:18.184
EXAM BECAUSE I RECEIVE PUBLIC

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.919
ASSISTANCE WITH MY HOUSE AND THE

01:54:19.986 --> 01:54:23.289
NEXT STEPS I HAD TO TAKE WERE

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:24.958
UNCLEAR.

TO GET MY MONEY BACK I WAS ONLY

01:54:36.536 --> 01:54:37.704
ABLE TO PAY MY BILLS DURING THIS

01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:39.872
TIME BECAUSE I BORROWED MONEY

01:54:39.939 --> 01:54:40.940
FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

01:54:41.007 --> 01:54:42.475
I WAS ABLE TO RECOVER THAT MONEY

TAKEN IN CHARGE THE BANK FEE

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.552
PREVENTING ME FROM HAVING

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:35.662

A PERSON KNOWS THAT THEY'RE

01:55:39.532 --> 01:55:40.800

THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A NOTICE --

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:52.312

01:58:22.295 --> 01:58:23.963
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:26.766
THE NATURE OF THE EXEMPTION.

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:27.733
IS THAT IT IS AUTOMATIC.

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:30.102
AND IT IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY

01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:31.904
DIFFICULT TO PREVENT DEBTORS AND

01:58:31.971 --> 01:58:33.406
OTHER BAD ACTORS FROM USING

CONVERSATION AND PERHAPS

02:04:52.551 --> 02:04:55.221
AMENDING THE BILL OBVIOUSLY NOT

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:57.089
TODAY.

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:58.490
BUT AT SOME POINT YEAH I MEAN.

02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:00.993
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:01.927
I I I I I YOU.

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:03.462

META AN AMOUNT THAT'S LIMITED

02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:13.005
WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO CHANGE THE

02:05:13.072 --> 02:05:15.574
LOSS TO THE LOWEST INCOME FOLKS.

02:05:15.641 --> 02:05:18.611
ARE ARE PROTECTED BUT YOU TAKE

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:20.446
THAT. 75% OF YOUR PAYCHECK AND

02:05:20.512 --> 02:05:22.114
YOU PUT IN THE CHECKING ACCOUNT

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:24.216
THE LEVY A CURSE THEY GET TODAY

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:25.150
IT TO LEVY ALL THE AMOUNT SO

02:05:25.217 --> 02:05:26.986
IT'S WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THE

02:05:27.052 --> 02:05:29.154
OF THE WAGE GARNISHMENT A

02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:33.325
LIMITATION THE WAGE GARNISHMENT --

02:05:33.392 --> 02:05:34.793
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT WE IT'S

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.595
IT'S IT'S IN OUR THINK TANK HI I

02:05:36.662 --> 02:05:39.064
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT -- WHO

02:05:39.131 --> 02:05:41.867
HAVE A MEANS TEST Là ON THE

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:42.201
BANK ACCOUNT?

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:49.074
YOU KNOW -- I I THINK I THINK --

02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:50.009
IN A WESTERN CENTER IS REALLY

02:05:50.075 --> 02:05:51.577
PROUD TO AND I THINK THAT THE

02:05:51.644 --> 02:05:54.446
LEGISLATURE IS -- TWO OF THE

02:05:54.513 --> 02:05:55.447
WAGE GARNISHMENT PROJECTIONS WE

02:05:55.514 --> 02:05:56.649
PUT IN PLACE AND THEY'VE BEEN

02:05:56.715 --> 02:05:58.484
WORKING WELL DESPITE THAT

02:05:58.550 --> 02:06:00.085
COMPLAINS THAT THEY WOULDN'T.

02:06:00.152 --> 02:06:02.354
AND THE CHARGES THAT IT WOULDN'T

02:06:02.421 --> 02:06:04.023
BE ABLE TO BE WORKABLE SEEMS TO

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:05.824
BE WORKING FINE AND PROTECTING

02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:11.897
LOW INCOME WAGE EARNERS -- THE

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:14.700
WE HAVE LOWERED THE AMOUNT.

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:16.769
THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IT

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:17.636
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S HOW

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:19.305
MUCH WE THINK PEOPLE CAN SAVE

02:06:19.371 --> 02:06:20.806
EVERY MONTH AND HAVE THIS LIKE

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:22.174
SITTING IN THE BANK THIS IS

02:06:22.241 --> 02:06:23.709
ACTUALLY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IS

02:06:23.776 --> 02:06:26.245
WHAT SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE EARNED --

02:06:26.312 --> 02:06:28.180
LIKE IT IN A AND A CASH PAYMENT

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:29.748
LIKE THAT A CONSTRUCTION WORKER

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:30.649
ONE OF MY CLIENTS WAS A

02:06:30.716 --> 02:06:32.618
CONSTRUCTION WORKER AND SO HIS

02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:34.019
PAYMENTSWENT INTO THE BANK

02:06:34.086 --> 02:06:34.687
ACCOUNT.

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:36.388
AND THAT WAS WHAT WAS LEVY AND

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:38.357
HE GOT A NOTICE OF THAT LEVY

02:06:38.424 --> 02:06:39.858
WHILE HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND

02:06:39.925 --> 02:06:42.094
HIS WIFE WAS HAVING A

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:42.761
MISCARRIAGE.

02:06:42.828 --> 02:06:44.229
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY WERE

02:06:44.296 --> 02:06:44.964
GOING TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT

02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:48.634
DAY -- AND AND TWO THOUSAND

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:50.302
DOLLARS IF YOU'RE LIVING JUST A

02:06:50.369 --> 02:06:53.305
PAYCHECK TO TO RENT PAYMENT IS

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:54.740
NOT THAT MUCH MONEY.

02:06:54.807 --> 02:06:56.342
ARE WE ARE WE ARE SPONSORS

02:06:56.408 --> 02:06:58.310
PREPARED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

02:06:58.377 --> 02:07:02.014
ABOUT LESS -- YOU KNOW I I THINK

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:02.848
THAT'S BECAUSE SPONSORS WE'RE

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:04.550
WILLING TO TO BE WITH OUR OUR

02:07:04.616 --> 02:07:06.385
CHAMPION AND AND TALK ABOUT IT

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:08.220
BUT WE WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

02:07:08.287 --> 02:07:09.922
THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:10.789
AMOUNT.

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:12.458
AND AND AND THE AND THE

02:07:12.524 --> 02:07:14.226
CONVERSATION THAT IT'S YOU KNOW

02:07:14.293 --> 02:07:15.461
THE ASSERTION THAT IT'S OKAY

02:07:15.527 --> 02:07:16.762
WELL FIRST OF ALL THAT MEDICAID

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:18.430
AS IN ANYBODY'S BANK ACCOUNT.

02:07:18.497 --> 02:07:20.232
IS NOT TRUE AND SO TO BE HERE ON

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:21.867
TESTIMONY AND SAY THAT YOU LOOK

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:22.701
AT THEIR BANK ACCOUNT FOR THE

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:23.469
MEDICAID.

02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:24.837
IS IS IT A FALSE STATEMENT AND

02:07:24.903 --> 02:07:26.572
SO IT OPENS UP A QUESTION AS TO

02:07:26.638 --> 02:07:28.540
WHETHER ANY OF THE STATEMENT HAS

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:31.877
BEEN TRUE OKAY I BUT I THINK IF

02:07:31.944 --> 02:07:34.513
WE WANT TO TIME WE CHOSE.

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:35.080
EXCUSE ME THE CLUTCHES FOCUS%

02:07:35.147 --> 02:07:35.748
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE SOME CONCERNS

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:37.483
ABOUT THE AMOUNT IN THE IN THE

02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:41.286
ANALYSIS ON PAGE -- SEVEN IT THE

02:07:41.353 --> 02:07:43.355
IT DISCUSSES THE FACT THAT --

02:07:43.422 --> 02:07:44.656
THERE ARE SIXTEEN OTHER STATES

02:07:44.723 --> 02:07:47.426
THE CURRENTLY PROVIDE EXEMPTIONS.

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:49.862
ON THE HIGH END MISSISSIPPI AND

TENNESSEE PROTECT TEN THOUSAND

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:53.532
DOLLARS.

02:07:53.599 --> 02:07:55.167
ON THE LOW END YOU HAVE --

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:56.402
ARIZONA IN PENNSYLVANIA THIS

02:07:56.468 --> 02:07:59.905
PROTECTIONS THREE HUNDRED AND WE

02:07:59.972 --> 02:08:01.240
HAVE STATES LIKE MASSACHUSETTS

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:03.108
IN NEVADA WHERE THE EXEMPTION

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:04.910
APPLIES AUTOMATICALLY.

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:06.345
AS WITH THIS BILL SO WITH SO

02:08:06.412 --> 02:08:09.281
WHICH THIS IS NOT OFF THE WALL

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:09.681
IN TERMS OF ITS.

02:08:09.748 --> 02:08:10.416
YEAH.

02:08:10.482 --> 02:08:11.984
THE QUESTION IS IS IS NOT THE

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:13.919
AMOUNT THE QUESTION IS HOW IT'S

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:15.854
APPLIED IN AND I TAKE YOUR POINT

02:08:15.921 --> 02:08:17.256
THAT FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKER

02:08:17.322 --> 02:08:18.524
WHOSE SPOUSES IN THE HOSPITAL

02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:19.625
HAVING A BABY.

02:08:19.691 --> 02:08:21.427
WHO HAS ZERO OTHER MEANS THAT

02:08:21.493 --> 02:08:22.861
THAT THAT TWO THOUSAND DOES NOT

02:08:22.928 --> 02:08:24.630
ENOUGH BUT BUT THERE ARE SOME

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:26.231
SCOFFLAWS AND WE DON'T NEED TO

02:08:26.298 --> 02:08:27.132
GET INTO IT?

02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:28.834
WHO WHO DO?

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:30.803
INAPPROPRIATELY BENEFIT BUT THE

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:33.038
THE NEXT QUESTION IS WITH

02:08:33.105 --> 02:08:34.273
RESPECT TO THE NOSE OF EXEMPTION

02:08:34.339 --> 02:08:36.942
BECAUSE OF EXEMPTION GOES AFTER

02:08:37.009 --> 02:08:37.242
LEVY.

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:39.478
THIS IS SOMEWHAT OFF TOPIC BUT

02:08:39.545 --> 02:08:40.813
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS

02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:42.147
IT THE NOTICE OF EXEMPTION

02:08:42.214 --> 02:08:43.849
OFTENTIMES.

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:45.751
THAT CONSUMER DEBT -- THAT THE

02:08:45.818 --> 02:08:47.553
JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AS WELL AS

02:08:47.619 --> 02:08:48.921
A AS A DEFAULT JUDGMENT.

02:08:48.987 --> 02:08:50.089
AND SO AT THAT POINT TIME THE

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:51.657
DEFAULT JUDGMENT HAS BE SERVED

02:08:51.723 --> 02:08:53.492
UPON THE DEBTOR.

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:55.027
IT POINT TIME AT THAT POINT TIME

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:56.995
IT WOULD SEEM LOGICAL TO PROVIDE

02:08:57.062 --> 02:08:57.863
THE DEBTOR THE LIST OF

02:08:57.930 --> 02:09:06.105
EXEMPTIONS RATHER THAN LATER ON

02:09:06.171 --> 02:09:07.072
DOWN THE ROAD OF BECAUSE OF THE

02:09:07.139 --> 02:09:07.873
DEBTORS PROVIDED THAT LIST OF

02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:08.540
EXEMPTIONS AT THAT POINT IN TIME.

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:09.041
THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:09.641
ACTUALLY FILE FOR ONE OF THE

02:09:09.708 --> 02:09:10.275
EXEMPTIONS ANYWAY SOMETHING FOR

02:09:10.342 --> 02:09:11.009
YOU TO CONSIDER IS IS PART OF

02:09:11.076 --> 02:09:11.977
THE PART OF THE BILL OF

UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THE

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:15.481
PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT.

02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:17.549
OF THOSE WHO DESERVE PROTECTION

02:09:17.616 --> 02:09:18.917
IS DEBTORS.

02:09:18.984 --> 02:09:22.354
SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:22.788
ALL RIGHT.

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:24.590

THERE IS THERE ARE A VARIETY

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:43.342
WAYS THE CREDITORS CAN COLLECT

02:09:43.408 --> 02:09:45.511
ON THEIR DEBT IF WE'RE FOCUSING

COUSIN FROM LAST YEAR THAT WE'VE

02:10:31.957 --> 02:10:33.058
TRIED TO WORK WITH THE

OPPOSITION AND TRY TO BE

02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:36.028
REFLECTIVE OF MEMBERS WHO HAVE

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:37.496

A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY GO BY

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:56.782
DEFAULT IN THE GOES THE WRONG

AND THIS BILL UPDATES AND

02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:33.892
STRENGTHENS OUR GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:15:38.797 --> 02:15:40.432
SO TEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA

PROGRAM WITH VAN.

02:15:43.768 --> 02:15:46.271
A SIMILAR FEAR IS A. B. EIGHTEEN

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:47.138

RECOGNIZE THREE KEY THINGS FIRST

02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:52.944
OF ALL THE CLIFORNIANS ARE

02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:55.080
SOMETIMES I KNOWINGLY EXPOSED TO

HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS.

02:15:57.182 --> 02:15:58.617
I IN THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE.

02:15:58.683 --> 02:15:59.885
TO THAT THE STATE HAS AN

02:15:59.951 --> 02:16:01.887
IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTING --

02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:03.522
CALIFORNIANS IN THAT IN THAT IN

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:04.623
THAT SENSE.

02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:05.891
AND THREE THAT USING THE BEST

02:16:05.957 --> 02:16:07.125
AVAILABLE SCIENCE IN A CLEAR

02:16:07.192 --> 02:16:10.128
TRANSPARENT REGULATORY PROCESS

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:11.463
IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS.

02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:13.798
SO THE DEPARTMENT TALK SUBS

02:16:13.865 --> 02:16:14.866

DEVELOP THE FIRST OF ITS KIND

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:20.705
SEE FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:22.274
PROGRAM IN THIS PROGRAM -- FIRST

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:24.643

CHEMICALS MAY BE AFFECTING USERS --

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:31.783
THEN DGSE SUPPOSED TO CALL UPON

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:32.984
MANUFACTURES TO FORM AN

02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:34.719
ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS. TO FIND

02:16:34.786 --> 02:16:35.186
CHEMICALS THAT CAN BE

02:16:35.253 --> 02:16:37.155
SUBSTITUTED TO KEEP FOLKS SAFER

02:16:37.222 --> 02:16:38.557
WHILE STILL PROVIDING THE

02:16:38.623 --> 02:16:40.625
PRODUCTS THAT THEY WANT AND NEED.

02:16:40.692 --> 02:16:41.493
THE GOALS OF THE FREE MARKET TO

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:42.460
SEE FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:16:42.527 --> 02:16:44.329
PROGRAM ARE COMMENDABLE THE WHAT

02:16:44.396 --> 02:16:46.464
BRINGS ME HERE TODAY -- IT TO

02:16:46.531 --> 02:16:48.466
PRESENT SB THREE NINETY TWO IS

02:16:48.533 --> 02:16:49.768
THE PROGRAM'S TIMELINE.

02:16:49.834 --> 02:16:51.069
HERE'S THE SHOCKING THING AND WE

02:16:51.136 --> 02:16:55.707
HAD THIS PROGRAM FOR TEN YEARS

02:16:55.774 --> 02:16:57.275
NOW AND TODAY.

02:16:57.342 --> 02:16:58.476
NO CHEMICAL NOT SING NOT ONE

02:16:58.543 --> 02:16:59.945
SINGLE CHEMICAL HAS HAD AN

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:01.112
ALTERNATE ANALYSIS COMPLETED

02:17:01.179 --> 02:17:01.846
UNDER THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:02.347
PRODUCTS PROGRAM.

02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:04.950
AND NO REGULATIONS HAVE RESULTED.

02:17:05.016 --> 02:17:06.217
SO OUR GREAT PROGRAM OF THE

02:17:06.284 --> 02:17:09.154
BOOKS NOT HELPING ANYBODY OUT

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.755
YET TEN YEARS IN.

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:12.023
AND IN FACT -- THE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:17:12.090 --> 02:17:13.725
INSTITUTE I TOOK A LONG HARD

02:17:13.792 --> 02:17:16.227
LOOK AT THE PROGRAM -- LOOKING

02:17:16.294 --> 02:17:17.062
AT YOUR GREEN CHEMISTRY TEN

02:17:17.128 --> 02:17:17.896
YEARS IN.

02:17:17.963 --> 02:17:19.164
AND AND WE'VE GOT A COPY OF IT

02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:21.600
HERE SOMEWHERE AND AND

02:17:21.666 --> 02:17:22.834
EFFECTIVELY.

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:24.502
BASICALLY LOOKED AT THE AT WHAT

02:17:24.569 --> 02:17:25.103
WAS GOING ON WITH THE PROGRAM

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:26.237
WAS SLOWING IT DOWN WHAT WAS

02:17:26.304 --> 02:17:27.839
WHAT WAS THE REASONS WHY.

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:30.942
WE HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE ANALYSIS

02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:33.278
COMPLETED INTO THE PROGRAM IN NO

02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:33.845
REGULATIONS.

02:17:33.912 --> 02:17:35.580
SO MY MY BILL BASICALLY COMES

02:17:35.647 --> 02:17:36.848
OUT OF THAT REPORT IT TAKES SOME

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:38.416
OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:39.284
THE REPORT.

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:40.852
SO IS TO STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM

02:17:40.919 --> 02:17:41.553
AND ALLOW IT TO ACHIEVE ITS

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.688

REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION THIS IS

02:18:08.179 --> 02:18:09.447
THE TERM OF ART IN THIS AREA.

02:18:09.514 --> 02:18:11.549
TO REFER TO A SUBSTITUTE

02:18:11.616 --> 02:18:12.550
CHEMICALS THAT ACTUALLY MAY

02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:14.452
CAUSE MORE HARM THAN THE

02:18:14.519 --> 02:18:15.754
CHEMICAL THEY WERE SUBSIDY --

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:17.188

02:19:26.324 --> 02:19:27.726
CHILDREN SLEEP MAPS.

02:19:27.792 --> 02:19:29.794
MASS THIS IS BUT ONE EXAMPLE OF

02:19:29.861 --> 02:19:31.663
WHY THE PROGRAM MUST WORK TO

02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:32.831
PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE

02:19:32.897 --> 02:19:34.766

LEGISLATION IN THE PROGRAM.

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:07.499
SO THAT WE CAN FIX BARRIERS AND

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:08.800
HOLES THAT WILL MAKE THIS

02:20:08.867 --> 02:20:10.468
CRITICAL PROGRAM WHEN IT NEEDS

02:20:10.535 --> 02:20:11.069
TO BE.

FOR PRODUCTS PROGRAM IS AN

02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:50.742
ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:52.310
ADDRESSING TOXIC CHEMICALS

02:20:52.377 --> 02:20:54.112
BEFORE THEY BECOME A PROBLEM.

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:55.046
THAT IS FOCUSING ON PREVENTING

02:20:55.113 --> 02:20:56.548
TOXIC EXPOSURES IN THE FIRST

02:20:56.614 --> 02:20:58.216
PLACE RATHER THAN CLEANING UP

MY COLLEAGUE BILL AALIYAH AND

02:21:04.055 --> 02:21:05.256
THE SENATOR HAVE OUTLINED BY THE

02:21:05.323 --> 02:21:06.291
IMPORTANT ROLE THE SAFER

02:21:06.357 --> 02:21:07.892
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IN

02:21:07.959 --> 02:21:10.128
PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE

02:21:10.195 --> 02:21:11.629
SLOW PACE OF THE PROGRAM TO DATE.

02:21:11.696 --> 02:21:13.565
A RECENT TEN YEAR RETROSPECTIVE

02:21:13.631 --> 02:21:14.833
OF THE CENTER OUTLINED --

02:21:14.899 --> 02:21:16.334
OUTLINED THE TREMENDOUS PROMISE

02:21:16.401 --> 02:21:17.669
OF THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO THE

02:21:17.735 --> 02:21:19.170
STRUCTURAL FACTORS THAT ARE

02:21:19.237 --> 02:21:20.004
HOLDING IT BACK.

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:21.372
MAKING A SERIES OF

02:21:21.439 --> 02:21:22.841
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT.

02:21:22.907 --> 02:21:24.843
SB THREE NINE TWO ACTS ON THOSE

02:21:24.909 --> 02:21:25.844
RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD REMOVE

02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:27.612
SEVERAL THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS

02:21:27.679 --> 02:21:29.047
HOLDING THE PROGRAM BACK. ONE

02:21:29.113 --> 02:21:30.715
KEY ISSUES THE PROGRAM'S LACK OF

02:21:30.782 --> 02:21:32.450
ACCESS TO PRODUCT INGREDIENT

02:21:32.517 --> 02:21:32.917
DATA.

02:21:32.984 --> 02:21:34.586
PROGRAM STAFF HAVE HAD TO RESORT

02:21:34.652 --> 02:21:35.787
TO GOOGLE SEARCHES AN

02:21:35.854 --> 02:21:37.689
UNSUCCESSFUL VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY

02:21:37.755 --> 02:21:41.292
REQUESTS TO GET INFORMATION

02:21:41.359 --> 02:21:42.260
PRODUCT INGREDIENTS.

02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:43.194
THE RESULT HAS BEEN LONG DELAYS

02:21:43.261 --> 02:21:44.629
AND HESITATION TO CONSIDER ALL

02:21:44.696 --> 02:21:47.031
THE PRINCIPAL INGREDIENTS.

02:21:47.098 --> 02:21:48.800
THE RESULT HAS BEEN US APARTMENT.

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:49.968
AS BETWEEN NINE TO PROVIDE THE

02:21:50.034 --> 02:21:51.836
DEPARTMENT CLEARER STRONGER DATA

02:21:51.903 --> 02:21:53.238
COLLECTION AUTHORITY THAT WILL

02:21:53.304 --> 02:21:54.439
PRESERVE THE TRADE SECRET

02:21:54.505 --> 02:21:56.507
PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN THE GREEN

02:21:56.574 --> 02:21:57.509
CHEMISTRY Là.

02:21:57.575 --> 02:21:58.509
THE SECOND ISSUE IS A LACK OF

02:21:58.576 --> 02:22:00.945
DEADLINES AND CLEAR REQUIREMENTS

02:22:01.012 --> 02:22:02.580
FOR THE PROGRAMS OUTLINED TIME

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:03.648
LINES FOR ACTION.

02:22:03.715 --> 02:22:05.316
WHICH A PRIVATE TRANSPARENCY AND

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:06.551
ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:22:06.618 --> 02:22:07.752
THE CURRENT THREE YEAR WORK

02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:09.287
PLANS ARE VAGUE.

02:22:09.354 --> 02:22:10.355
AND NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO BE

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:11.689
MEANINGFUL.

02:22:11.756 --> 02:22:12.957
THEY FACILITATE THE LENGTHY

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:13.791
DELAYS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:22:13.858 --> 02:22:15.193
UNFORTUNATE FEATURE OF THE

02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:16.461
PROGRAM TO DATE.

02:22:16.527 --> 02:22:17.962
SB THREE NINE TWO WOULD REQUIRE

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:19.364
THE AGENCY TO DEVELOP A WORK

02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:21.065
PLAN TO ADDRESS FIVE PRODUCT

02:22:21.132 --> 02:22:22.767
CATEGORIES AND SUBCATEGORIES IN

02:22:22.834 --> 02:22:24.135
FIVE YEARS.

02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:25.637
IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THEM TO

02:22:25.703 --> 02:22:26.838
DEVELOP TIMELINE FOR THE VARIOUS

02:22:26.905 --> 02:22:29.240
STEPS INVOLVED.

02:22:29.307 --> 02:22:29.974
IT WOULD REQUIRE THE

02:22:30.041 --> 02:22:31.576
CONSIDERATION OF ALL CHEMICALS

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:33.378
OF CONCERN THAT SERVE THE SAME

02:22:33.444 --> 02:22:34.879
PURPOSE A FUNCTION DISS SO THAT

02:22:34.946 --> 02:22:36.681
WE WILL HAVE THE SITUATION OF

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:38.149
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION AND

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:40.919
HAVE THE PRODUCT COME BACK TO

02:22:40.985 --> 02:22:41.486
THE AGENCY A COUPLE OF YEARS

02:22:41.552 --> 02:22:44.923
LATER.

02:22:44.989 --> 02:22:46.658
YES I PUT UP THANK YOU

02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:48.259
ABSOLUTELY -- LAST FACTOR IS A

02:22:48.326 --> 02:22:49.894
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND

02:22:49.961 --> 02:22:51.362
WE CREATE A FAST TRACK -- THE

02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:53.631
APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THAT --

02:22:53.698 --> 02:22:55.733
THAT WHEN THERE IS EXISTING

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.135
STUDIES IN PLACE THOSE SUDIES

02:22:57.201 --> 02:22:58.803
CAN BE RELIED UPON BY THE AGENCY

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:01.072
TO ACT AND NEED NOT REQUIRE A

02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:03.007
LENGTHY YEARS LONG PROCESS OF

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:05.109
INDIVIDUAL ALL TURNS ANALYSES BY

02:23:05.176 --> 02:23:06.044
COMPANIES.

02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:07.512
THIS COULD NOT ONLY SPEED UP THE

02:23:07.578 --> 02:23:09.113
PROCESS A COULD SAVE RESOURCE

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:10.982
STRAPS SMALLER COMPANIES MONEY.

02:23:11.049 --> 02:23:12.383
AND THE SB THREE I DO FINALLY

02:23:12.450 --> 02:23:14.485
PROVIDES PROVISIONS TO REMOVE

02:23:14.552 --> 02:23:17.288
REDUNDANCIES IN THE PROCESS AND

02:23:17.355 --> 02:23:19.090
WOOD -- BOSSES THANK YOU PROGRAM

02:23:19.157 --> 02:23:21.192
FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE ARE

02:23:21.259 --> 02:23:26.264
DRIVES I IS VERY NICE TO ME SHE

02:23:26.331 --> 02:23:27.398
ADDED.

02:44:08.338 --> 02:44:10.207
UNDERMINING CALIFORNIANS ABILITY

THOSE FEARS SEEM RATHER

02:44:36.199 --> 02:44:37.567

02:45:21.611 --> 02:45:23.246
IN THE WAKE OF THE ENACTMENT OF

02:45:23.313 --> 02:45:25.282
THE CCPA THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

02:45:25.348 --> 02:45:27.584
SENT A LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE.

02:45:27.651 --> 02:45:29.219
WARNING THERE THERE WERE SERIOUS

02:45:29.286 --> 02:45:31.788

02:45:43.967 --> 02:45:46.169
AGREEING THAT ENFORCEMENT IS KEY

02:45:46.236 --> 02:45:48.471
AND THAT THE CCP A LACKS PROPER

02:45:48.538 --> 02:45:50.774
MECHANISMS I HAVE PARTNERED WITH

02:49:59.923 --> 02:50:01.758

02:50:01.824 --> 02:50:03.092
TOO MANY BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

02:50:03.159 --> 02:50:04.827

02:50:04.894 --> 02:50:06.362
THAT SELF REGULATION CAN NO

INNOVATE NOT VIOLATE.

02:50:42.599 --> 02:50:44.267
IT IS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT TO

IN THE HE INTO INFORMATION

02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:10.193
HEARING THAT WE HAD JUST A FEW

WEEKS AGO WE HAD PEOPLE COME

02:51:12.495 --> 02:51:14.430
FORWARD WHO FOR WHOM PRIOR --

02:51:14.497 --> 02:51:16.733
PRIVACY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY AND

02:51:16.799 --> 02:51:18.301
HOW THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:20.803
INNOVATE AND CREATE OPERATE.

02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:23.306
COMPANIES THAT PROMISE PRIVACY

02:51:23.373 --> 02:51:24.474
AND THAT THEIR COMPANIES ARE

02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:26.009
FLOURISHING.

02:51:26.075 --> 02:51:28.444
IT IS POSSIBLE IT IS DOABLE AND

02:51:28.511 --> 02:51:29.679
WITH CONSTITUTIONAL A

02:51:29.746 --> 02:51:31.080
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IT IS

02:51:31.147 --> 02:51:34.050

AND WHILE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY

02:51:38.321 --> 02:51:39.589

GREAT BENEFIT TO SOCIETY THERE'S

02:51:41.824 --> 02:51:42.825
NO ARGUMENT THERE.

02:51:42.892 --> 02:51:44.527
SOMETIMES IT IS THE GOVERNMENT

02:51:44.594 --> 02:51:46.129
THAT NEEDS TO STEP IN AND ENSURE

02:51:46.195 --> 02:51:47.630
THAT THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE

02:51:47.697 --> 02:51:49.399

02:51:50.566 --> 02:51:52.402

03:09:35.964 --> 03:09:37.265
FAIRLY CLEAR AND IF THERE ARE

03:09:37.332 --> 03:09:38.166
ANY PROBLEMS.

03:09:38.233 --> 03:09:40.602
BE FURTHER DISCUSSION TO TRY.

03:09:40.669 --> 03:09:42.104
TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT WILL

03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:43.405
GIVE THE APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE TO

03:09:43.472 --> 03:09:46.475
THESE COMPANIES BUT RIGHT NOW

03:09:46.541 --> 03:09:47.509
THERE IS A RIGHT TO CURE.

03:09:47.576 --> 03:09:49.344
AND SO THE THE QUESTION WOULD BE

03:09:49.411 --> 03:09:51.847
HOW IS THAT TO FIND IF IF YOU'RE.

03:09:51.913 --> 03:09:54.382
THE JUDGE HOW DOES ONE DECIDE

03:09:54.449 --> 03:09:55.217
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN

03:09:55.283 --> 03:09:57.319
ADEQUATE COMPLIANCE THERE

03:09:57.385 --> 03:09:59.054
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A STANDARD --

03:09:59.121 --> 03:10:00.388
WHETHER IT'S SUBSTANTIAL

03:10:00.455 --> 03:10:03.692
COMPLIANCE WHETHER IT IT IS YOU

03:10:03.759 --> 03:10:04.760
KNOW ABSOLUTE.

03:10:04.826 --> 03:10:05.927
THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM

03:10:05.994 --> 03:10:07.462
WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF THE

03:10:07.529 --> 03:10:08.864
BILL BUT I'LL DEFER TO THE

03:10:08.930 --> 03:10:10.332

PRIVACY UNIT AT THE AG'S OFFICE.

03:10:16.171 --> 03:10:17.806
SO LET ME JUST BE CLEAR AND JUST

03:10:17.873 --> 03:10:19.641
DISCUSS THE RIGHT TO CARE BUT

03:10:19.708 --> 03:10:20.275
THERE'S A RIGHT TO CARE

03:10:20.342 --> 03:10:22.611

03:10:26.581 --> 03:10:28.416
THAT THE AG THAT ASIDE I PUTTING

03:10:28.483 --> 03:10:29.251

GREAT OKAY SO THERE'S AN

03:10:30.819 --> 03:10:32.020

PROVISION IN THIS FINAL LIGHT

03:11:41.957 --> 03:11:43.491
LOSS OF A COULD SEVENTEEN NINETY

REGARDING A RIGHT TO CARE FOR

03:12:10.886 --> 03:12:11.853
EXAMPLE.

03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:13.054
CIVIL CODE SECTION FIFTY FIVE

03:12:13.121 --> 03:12:14.522
POINT FIFTY SIX ENUMERATE THAT

03:12:14.589 --> 03:12:16.358
TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS OF THE ADA

03:12:16.424 --> 03:12:19.361
FOR EXAMPLE THAT BEFORE A SMALL

BUSINESS -- CAN.

03:12:22.564 --> 03:12:23.999
BE SUED FOR A VIOLATION OF THE

ADA FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS

03:12:26.034 --> 03:12:26.835
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE

03:12:26.902 --> 03:12:29.871
OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT WITHIN

03:12:29.938 --> 03:12:30.939
FIFTEEN DAYS SO THERE AND

03:12:31.006 --> 03:12:33.675
THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES TO HAPPY

03:12:33.742 --> 03:12:35.076
TO DISCUSS FURTHER.

03:12:35.143 --> 03:12:37.479
ILLUSTRATE MY POINT MY POINT IS

03:12:37.545 --> 03:12:38.113
IS THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE

03:12:38.179 --> 03:12:39.948
YOU SAID THAT THERE'S AT LEAST

03:12:40.015 --> 03:12:41.516
THREE DEFINITIONS FOR CURE.

03:12:41.583 --> 03:12:44.019
AND SO FOR BUSINESS TO MEET

03:12:44.085 --> 03:12:45.787
WHATEVER STANDARD THAT EMBODY

03:12:45.854 --> 03:12:47.656
HERE AND I GET IT IT WAS THE

03:12:47.722 --> 03:12:49.224
BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR.

03:12:49.291 --> 03:12:51.593
I WAS IN HERE BUT FOR SOMEONE TO

03:12:51.660 --> 03:12:53.261
BE ABLE TO COMPLY IN THE CURE

03:12:53.328 --> 03:12:54.663
THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE

03:12:54.729 --> 03:12:57.098
STANDARD MIGHT BE.

03:12:57.165 --> 03:12:58.033
AND THEY NEED TO KNOW.

03:12:58.099 --> 03:12:59.467
YOU KNOW IT IN ESSENCE HOW MUCH

03:12:59.534 --> 03:13:01.169
TIME AND I I THINK I GOT THE

03:13:01.236 --> 03:13:02.304
THIRTY DAYS IN HERE.

03:13:02.370 --> 03:13:03.605
BUT WHAT DOES THAT WHAT DOES

03:13:03.672 --> 03:13:05.206
THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY

03:13:05.273 --> 03:13:07.842
NEED TO DO SO I I WOULD.

03:13:07.909 --> 03:13:12.213
SUGGEST THAT THE THAT THERE

03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:13.615
NEEDS TO BE AT THE VERY LEAST.

03:13:13.682 --> 03:13:14.783
A FURTHER DEFINITION OF CURE ANY

03:13:14.849 --> 03:13:15.850
STANDARD THAT THE JUDGE CAN

03:13:15.917 --> 03:13:17.519
EMPLOY.

03:13:17.585 --> 03:13:19.387
SO WHEN WHEN SHE LOOKS AT THIS

03:13:19.454 --> 03:13:22.490
SHE CAN SAY YES THEY HAVE MET.

03:13:22.557 --> 03:13:24.459
SUBSTANTIALLY.

03:13:24.526 --> 03:13:25.427
AND I THINK SENATOR AND

03:13:25.493 --> 03:13:27.395
APPRECIATED REFERRING TO THE

03:13:27.462 --> 03:13:29.631
JUDGES SHE I DID CATCH THAT --

03:13:29.698 --> 03:13:32.033
DAY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ARE AYE

03:13:32.100 --> 03:13:36.571
ONE IS FINE -- BUT I THINK ONCE

03:13:36.638 --> 03:13:38.206
WE GET THE REGULATIONS.

03:13:38.273 --> 03:13:40.208
WILL BE ABLE THEN TO PUT THE TO

03:13:40.275 --> 03:13:41.676
DEFINE RIGHT TO CURE BECAUSE

03:13:41.743 --> 03:13:42.477
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T EVEN IF

03:13:42.544 --> 03:13:44.546
REGULATIONS AS TO WHAT THEY NEED

03:13:44.612 --> 03:13:46.181
TO DO IN ORDER TO BE COMPLYING

03:13:46.247 --> 03:13:47.849
BUT I DO AGREE I THINK THAT'S AN

03:13:47.916 --> 03:13:49.684
IMPORTANT POINT.

03:13:49.751 --> 03:13:50.452
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:13:50.518 --> 03:13:51.786
THAT.

03:13:51.853 --> 03:13:53.455
THAT THAT WILL IN FACT.

03:13:53.521 --> 03:13:55.290
BE CLEAR ENOUGH BECAUSE IF THE

03:13:55.357 --> 03:13:56.992
IF THERE IS FOUNDER PRIVATE

03:13:57.058 --> 03:13:58.793
RIGHT OF ACTION RIGHT TO CURE --

03:13:58.860 --> 03:14:00.662
IT IT HAS TO HAVE SOME

03:14:00.729 --> 03:14:02.330
PARAMETERS TO IT RIGHT NOW THERE

03:14:02.397 --> 03:14:03.765
AREN'T ANY PARAMETERS BECAUSE OF

03:14:03.832 --> 03:14:05.000
THE THE AG IS STUCK CHILLS

03:14:05.066 --> 03:14:09.104
PUTTING THESE REGULATIONS

03:14:09.170 --> 03:14:12.140
TOGETHER.

03:14:12.207 --> 03:14:13.641
SO PUTTING THAT ASIDE OF PERHAPS

03:14:13.708 --> 03:14:15.043
WE COULD HAVE OUR ANOTHER MEMBER

03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:17.579
THE AG'S OFFICE HAVE A SENATOR --

03:14:17.645 --> 03:14:19.481
I THINK THE THE DIFFERENT

03:14:19.547 --> 03:14:21.082
EXAMPLES OF READY CARE WHERE

03:14:21.149 --> 03:14:22.250
THEY EXIST IN THE LAW WE

03:14:22.317 --> 03:14:24.719
RESEARCH THEM AND JUST TO SEE

03:14:24.786 --> 03:14:25.820
THE RANGE.

03:14:25.887 --> 03:14:28.390
OF HOW THIS ISSUES APPROACHED IN

03:14:28.456 --> 03:14:30.158
VARIOUS PLACES REPAIRS ON THE

03:14:30.225 --> 03:14:31.493
LINE NOW.

03:14:31.559 --> 03:14:33.161
AND AND IT PROVIDES A BASIS FOR

03:14:33.228 --> 03:14:35.163
DISCUSSING IN FINE TUNING THIS

03:14:35.230 --> 03:14:37.298
FURTHER I THINK WHAT WE SEE IS

03:14:37.365 --> 03:14:40.001
FOR EXAMPLE IN.

03:14:40.068 --> 03:14:41.569
SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO THE RECORD

03:14:41.636 --> 03:14:42.237
SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO YOU HAVE AN

03:14:42.303 --> 03:14:44.139
APPROACH WHERE THEY DEFINED HERE

03:14:44.205 --> 03:14:45.940
AS AN APPROPRIATE CORRECTION

03:14:46.007 --> 03:14:47.575
REPAIR REPLACEMENT OR OTHER

03:14:47.642 --> 03:14:48.810
REMEDY.

03:14:48.877 --> 03:14:50.412
THEY TRY TO DEFINE AND WORD FROM

03:14:50.478 --> 03:14:52.113
THAT THE IN IN IN A DIFFERENT

03:14:52.180 --> 03:14:55.283
SECTION -- FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

03:14:55.350 --> 03:14:57.852
LABOR CODE -- THEY TAKEN

03:14:57.919 --> 03:15:01.256
APPROACH OF PROCEDURAL A

03:15:01.322 --> 03:15:03.892
PROCEDURAL APPROACH THAT WILL IN

03:15:03.958 --> 03:15:04.526
TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE [inaudible]

03:15:04.592 --> 03:15:06.528
THE COULD.

03:15:06.594 --> 03:15:07.962
WORD SMITH MAYBE WE DIRECTLY

03:15:08.029 --> 03:15:09.898
WHAT CURE MEANS CURE MEANS ONE

03:15:09.964 --> 03:15:11.466
THING TO ANOTHER PERSON BUT BY

03:15:11.533 --> 03:15:13.501
CREATING GREATER DUE PROCESS

03:15:13.568 --> 03:15:15.503
AROUND THIS PROCEDURE WHERE IF

03:15:15.570 --> 03:15:16.738
YOU.

03:15:16.805 --> 03:15:18.573
HAVE A DISPUTE OVER WHETHER

03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:20.675
SOMETHING IS CURATOR NOT FRIED

03:15:20.742 --> 03:15:22.243
YOU ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES.

03:15:22.310 --> 03:15:24.212
AND DUE PROCESS INTO GETTING TO

03:15:24.279 --> 03:15:25.747
A RESOLUTION THERE THAT WAY.

03:15:25.814 --> 03:15:29.250
NO ONE IS AND FAIRLY HARMED BY A

03:15:29.317 --> 03:15:31.553
WHAT I GET ALL THAT I I GET THAT

03:15:31.619 --> 03:15:32.620
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS

03:15:32.687 --> 03:15:34.189
PROVIDE A MECHANISM SO THAT

03:15:34.255 --> 03:15:36.057
BUSINESSES YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME

03:15:36.124 --> 03:15:37.192
OF THE ADA SO THAT BUSINESSES

03:15:37.258 --> 03:15:39.694
ARE UNFAIRLY SORT OF BOTH

03:15:39.761 --> 03:15:41.596
FETTERED AND AFFECTED BY.

03:15:41.663 --> 03:15:44.165
BY THIS LAW MY CONCERN IS THOUGH

03:15:44.232 --> 03:15:46.668
IS IMMATURITY CREATES ALL SORTS

03:15:46.734 --> 03:15:48.169
OF CHALLENGES AND SO.

03:15:48.236 --> 03:15:49.304
LET ME LET ME JUST PUT THAT

03:15:49.370 --> 03:15:51.473
ASIDE FOR A SECOND I THINK THE

03:15:51.539 --> 03:15:52.941
MANAGER THANK YOU YOU ALREADY

03:15:53.007 --> 03:15:54.576
AGREE THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE.

03:15:54.642 --> 03:15:55.477
AND I AND I'M NOT SURE

03:15:55.543 --> 03:15:58.213
REGULATIONS QUITE RESOLVE IT A

03:15:58.279 --> 03:15:59.314
COURTS CONNECT APPLIES THE

03:15:59.380 --> 03:16:02.550
SECOND QUESTION IS IN THIS IS --

03:16:02.617 --> 03:16:04.119
TO THE THE FOLKS IN THE AG'S

03:16:04.185 --> 03:16:06.087
OFFICE IS THAT THERE IS ANOTHER

03:16:06.154 --> 03:16:07.856
MECHANISM FOR ENFORCEMENT AND

03:22:55.963 --> 03:22:57.665
ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE

03:22:57.732 --> 03:23:00.368
IMPLEMENTED AND I I REALLY --

03:23:00.434 --> 03:23:02.803
APPRECIATED THE I I HAVE READ A

03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:03.838
LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN

03:23:03.905 --> 03:23:06.173
EUROPE AND I REALLY APPRECIATED

03:23:06.240 --> 03:23:08.075
THE FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE

03:23:08.142 --> 03:23:09.210
ADVICE WARNINGS AUDITS AND

03:23:09.277 --> 03:23:10.611
FINANCE I JUST THINK THAT THAT.

03:23:10.678 --> 03:23:12.313
ANYWAY ANY TIME THAT YOU'RE

03:23:12.380 --> 03:23:14.582
LOOKING AT A NEW -- A NEW

03:23:14.649 --> 03:23:15.383
STRUCTURE AND WHAT THE

03:23:15.449 --> 03:23:17.251
OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

03:23:17.318 --> 03:23:18.553
ARE THE MORE THAT YOU CAN TRAIN

03:23:18.619 --> 03:23:20.721
AND GET PEOPLE TO VOLUNTARILY DO

03:23:20.788 --> 03:23:22.156
IT THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO

03:23:22.223 --> 03:23:22.990
BE SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:23:23.057 --> 03:23:23.691
THAT.

03:23:23.758 --> 03:23:24.725
THAT IT'S CLEAR I'M TALKING

03:23:24.792 --> 03:23:26.093
ABOUT START UPS AS WELL AS SMALL

03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:27.128
BUSINESSES AND THEN THE

03:23:27.194 --> 03:23:29.297
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A A

03:23:29.363 --> 03:23:31.098
PIZZA PARLOR BECAUSE I DON'T

03:23:31.165 --> 03:23:35.102
THINK THAT THAT THAT THIS -- AB

03:23:35.169 --> 03:23:37.271
REQUIREMENT OR THAT THIS --

03:23:37.338 --> 03:23:39.407
LEGISLATION WAS INTENDED TO

03:23:39.473 --> 03:23:41.175
CAPTURE ALL OF THOSE ARE GOING

03:23:41.242 --> 03:23:42.677
TO NOT NOT AT ALL NOR NOR THE

03:23:42.743 --> 03:23:44.178
START OFF I THINK ONCE WE SET

03:23:44.245 --> 03:23:45.813
SOME BASIC PARAMETERS.

03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:50.251
COMPANIES WILL FOLLOW THEM AT

03:23:50.318 --> 03:23:50.851
AGAIN.

03:23:50.918 --> 03:23:51.118
OF A WIN.

03:23:51.185 --> 03:23:52.420
MR SOCCER BERG SAYS WE NEED MORE

03:23:52.486 --> 03:23:54.789
REGULATION AND AND THE GOAL IS

03:23:54.855 --> 03:23:56.657
NOT TO CONFUSE PEOPLE THE GOAL

03:23:56.724 --> 03:23:59.393
IS TO SET SOME PARAMETERS THAT

03:23:59.460 --> 03:24:01.329
EVERYBODY CAN UNDERSTAND -- SO

03:24:01.395 --> 03:24:02.563
THAT WE CAN PROTECT.

03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:04.632
PRIVACY RIGHTS AND AT THE SAME

03:24:04.699 --> 03:24:06.667
TIME I SHARE WITH YOU AND I

03:24:06.734 --> 03:24:08.369
IMAGINE AT THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:24:08.436 --> 03:24:13.507
SUPPORTING INNOVATION I THINK WE

03:24:13.574 --> 03:24:15.109
CAN DO BOTH.

03:24:15.176 --> 03:24:15.776
THANK YOU I CENTER MINING.

03:24:15.843 --> 03:24:18.813
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I WANT

03:24:18.879 --> 03:24:20.314
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

03:24:20.381 --> 03:24:22.550
THIS FORWARD AND THE ATTORNEY

03:24:22.617 --> 03:24:24.485
GENERAL AND I THINK.

03:24:24.552 --> 03:24:26.153
THE OPPONENTS DID NOT RACIST

03:24:26.220 --> 03:24:28.389
AFFIRMATIVELY BIT IN ARGUMENTS

03:24:28.456 --> 03:24:30.257
LEADING UP TODAY WE'VE HEARD --

03:24:30.324 --> 03:24:32.126
WHEN WE MADE A DEAL BEFORE THE

03:24:32.193 --> 03:24:36.564
END OF SESSION AND -- HOW CAN WE?

03:24:36.631 --> 03:24:38.899
CHANGE THE TERMS OF A DEAL THAT

03:24:38.966 --> 03:24:40.234
WAS AGREED.

03:24:40.301 --> 03:24:41.602
TO WELL THE DEAL THE RESERVE A

03:24:41.669 --> 03:24:43.337
TWO POINTS OUT.

03:24:43.404 --> 03:24:44.839
MAYBE THE BENEFITS AND MAYBE THE

03:24:44.905 --> 03:24:47.441
DOWNSIDES OF THIS SHORT WINDOW

03:24:47.508 --> 03:24:48.943
OF TRYING TO KEEP A BALLOT

03:24:49.010 --> 03:24:50.544
MEASURE OFF THE BALLOT.

03:24:50.611 --> 03:24:52.580
IN TRYING TO COME UP WITH

03:24:52.647 --> 03:24:55.983
LEGISLATIVE -- ALTERNATIVE BUT I

03:24:56.050 --> 03:24:57.685
WOULD POINT OUT THE BENEFIT OF

03:24:57.752 --> 03:24:59.286
THE LEGISLATIVE ALTERNATIVE IS

03:24:59.353 --> 03:25:00.988
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK

03:25:01.055 --> 03:25:02.089
TO THE BALLOT TO FIX SOMETHING

03:25:02.156 --> 03:25:04.392
THAT'S TERRIBLY COMPLEX.

03:25:04.458 --> 03:25:06.293
AND IF IT'S PASSED ON THE BALLOT

03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:08.062
THE ONLY WAY YOU FIX IT IS TO GO

03:25:08.129 --> 03:25:09.263
BACK TO THE BALLOT.

03:25:09.330 --> 03:25:13.634
SO AS AS MESSY OR AS UNDESIRABLE

03:25:13.701 --> 03:25:15.569
AS THIS PROCESS MAY SEEM I THINK

03:25:15.636 --> 03:25:16.871
IT'S BETTER THAN HAVING TO GO

03:25:16.937 --> 03:25:18.472
BACK TO THE BALLOT.

03:25:18.539 --> 03:25:20.474
IN ONE OF THE BIG CHANGES FOR ME

03:25:20.541 --> 03:25:22.209
THAT THAT SUGGESTS THAT WERE NOT

03:25:22.276 --> 03:25:24.812
SOMEHOW VIOLATING OUR WORD.

03:25:24.879 --> 03:25:26.714
IS THAT WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT

03:25:26.781 --> 03:25:28.816
OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WE TASK

03:25:28.883 --> 03:25:30.351
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

03:25:30.418 --> 03:25:31.886
WITH ENFORCEMENT.

03:25:31.952 --> 03:25:34.555
OF THE BILL THAT WE PASSED IN

03:25:34.622 --> 03:25:35.389
THE ELEVENTH HOUR.

03:25:35.456 --> 03:25:36.991
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NOW COMES

03:25:37.058 --> 03:25:38.859
BACK AND SAYS YOU'VE TASK ME WAS

03:25:38.926 --> 03:25:40.828
SOMETHING THAT WERE OT RESOURCE

03:25:40.895 --> 03:25:43.497
FOR THAT WE DON'T THINK WE CAN.

03:25:43.564 --> 03:25:45.733
PERFORM THESE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS

03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:49.203
OF ADVICE AND COUNSEL OF RIGHT

03:25:49.270 --> 03:25:51.005
TO CURE AND THEN POTENTIALLY

03:25:51.072 --> 03:25:54.141
PROSECUTION -- SO I HAVE A

03:25:54.208 --> 03:25:55.843
COUPLE OF OTHER COMMENTS IN THIS

03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:59.480
WILL LEAD TO SOME QUESTIONS ON

03:25:59.547 --> 03:26:01.315
WHEN WE LOOK AT EUROPE AND THAT

03:26:01.382 --> 03:26:02.316
WAS.

03:26:02.383 --> 03:26:05.720
GUIDING FOR MUCH OF WHAT WAS WAS

03:26:05.786 --> 03:26:07.054
INCLUDED.

03:26:07.121 --> 03:26:09.890
IN IN THE BILL THAT WE PASSED --

03:26:09.957 --> 03:26:11.258
IT WAS.

03:26:11.325 --> 03:26:13.461
CONSIDERED AN GUIDED IN SEVEN

03:26:13.527 --> 03:26:15.763
YEARS OF WORK BY -- THE PRIOR

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:20.267
ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC --

03:26:20.334 --> 03:26:22.403
TO ME THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS

03:26:22.470 --> 03:26:23.003
THAT.

03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:25.706
OUR LAW REQUIRES A CONSUMER TO

03:26:25.773 --> 03:26:28.409
OPT IN TO BE PROTECTED.

03:26:28.476 --> 03:26:30.377
I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THAT

03:26:30.444 --> 03:26:32.346
ASPECT OF THIS BILL.

03:26:32.413 --> 03:26:35.282
WE HAVE 94% OF CALIFORNIANS

03:26:35.349 --> 03:26:36.851
SAYING THEY WANT PROTECTION.

03:26:36.917 --> 03:26:38.018
THING THEY BELIEVE THEY SHOULD

03:26:38.085 --> 03:26:40.187
HAVE A RIGHT TO ENFORCE THEIR

03:26:40.254 --> 03:26:41.889
RIGHTS IN THEIR PROTECTIONS AND

03:26:41.956 --> 03:26:43.390
YET WE FORCE THEM TO TAKE AN

03:26:43.457 --> 03:26:46.227
AFFIRMATIVE ACT TO BE PROTECTED.

03:26:46.293 --> 03:26:47.862
TO ME THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW

03:26:47.928 --> 03:26:49.463
IN WHAT WE PASSED IT'S A

03:26:49.530 --> 03:26:50.998
FUNDAMENTAL FLAW AS WE MOVE

03:26:51.065 --> 03:26:52.700
FORWARD.

03:26:52.767 --> 03:26:54.802
BUT I REALIZE THAT'S NOT WHAT IS

03:26:54.869 --> 03:26:55.302
IN FRONT OF US BUT LET'S

03:26:55.369 --> 03:26:56.804
REMEMBER.

03:26:56.871 --> 03:26:59.206
I COME AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS.

03:26:59.273 --> 03:27:01.909
OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS.

03:27:01.976 --> 03:27:03.611
AND THAT DOESN'T DIMINISH MY

03:27:03.677 --> 03:27:04.979
RESPECT MY CONCERN FOR

03:27:05.045 --> 03:27:07.314
BUSINESSES WHO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT

03:27:07.381 --> 03:27:08.716
AND GRAPPLE WITH THIS.

03:27:08.783 --> 03:27:10.718
ITEM I THINK WE NEED SOME

03:27:10.785 --> 03:27:12.686
BREATHING SPACE AND ONE REASON

03:27:12.753 --> 03:27:14.121
I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY IS

03:27:14.188 --> 03:27:15.422
BECAUSE OF THE AUTHORS

03:27:15.489 --> 03:27:16.991
COMMITMENT AND THE ATTORNEY

03:27:17.057 --> 03:27:18.993
GENERAL TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS

03:27:19.059 --> 03:27:20.361
WITH THE CONCERN OF PROTECTING

03:27:20.427 --> 03:27:21.629
SMALL BUSINESSES.

03:27:21.695 --> 03:27:24.398
WE CAN CREATE SOME CATEGORIES IN

03:27:24.465 --> 03:27:25.633
HERE IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT

03:27:25.699 --> 03:27:27.401
TERMS OF BOTH OBLIGATIONS AND

03:27:27.468 --> 03:27:28.536
DUTIES.

03:27:28.602 --> 03:27:29.870
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

03:27:29.937 --> 03:27:33.040
BETWEEN GIANT MULTINATIONAL

03:27:33.107 --> 03:27:35.776
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.

03:27:35.843 --> 03:27:37.745
IN A SMALL START UP THAT MAYBE

03:27:37.812 --> 03:27:39.280
ONCE BILL TO SWIPE.

03:27:39.346 --> 03:27:40.614
A CREDIT CARD AT THEIR RETAIL

03:27:40.681 --> 03:27:42.116
BUSINESS.

03:27:42.183 --> 03:27:43.984
WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT WE CAN

03:27:44.051 --> 03:27:46.020
BUILD IN SOME CATEGORIES NINE

03:27:46.086 --> 03:27:47.855
INVITE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO

03:27:47.922 --> 03:27:48.355
BE.

03:27:48.422 --> 03:27:50.357
PARTNERS IN DOING THAT I THINK

03:27:50.424 --> 03:27:51.792
WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT [inaudible]

03:27:51.859 --> 03:27:55.796
ON I ALSO.

03:27:55.863 --> 03:27:57.832
I THINK THE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

03:27:57.898 --> 03:28:03.204
ACTION QUESTION -- THE REASON

03:28:03.270 --> 03:28:04.738
THAT'S IMPORTANT IN FRONT OF US

03:28:04.805 --> 03:28:07.174
TODAY IS BECAUSE THE NEW

03:28:07.241 --> 03:28:09.610
INFORMATION IS THE ENFORCEMENT

03:28:09.677 --> 03:28:11.545
ENTITY INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL

03:28:11.612 --> 03:28:12.980
BILL SAYS WE DON'T THINK WE HAVE

03:28:13.047 --> 03:28:15.082
THE CAPACITY. TO DO IT SO SOME

03:28:15.149 --> 03:28:17.785
OTHER IDEAS OF COME UP THE

03:28:17.852 --> 03:28:19.253
SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED APPROACH

03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:21.422
COMPARING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.

03:28:21.488 --> 03:28:23.123
CITY ATTORNEY'S BUT EVEN WITHIN

03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:24.758
THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION OF

03:28:24.825 --> 03:28:27.194
CONSUMER IN IN THAT AREA WE

03:28:27.261 --> 03:28:29.797
COULD CREATE SOME CATEGORIES AS

03:28:29.864 --> 03:28:29.997
WELL.

03:28:30.064 --> 03:28:33.400
IN TERMS OF DAMAGE LIMITS BASED

03:28:33.467 --> 03:28:35.970
ON THE TYPE OF A BREACH -- OR

03:28:36.036 --> 03:28:38.272
VIOLATION ON AND HAVE SOME

03:28:38.339 --> 03:28:39.907
CATEGORIES THERE TO WHAT TYPE OF

03:28:39.974 --> 03:28:41.942
BREACH WE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER

03:28:42.009 --> 03:28:43.244
SOME DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN.

03:28:43.310 --> 03:28:46.614
PERSONAL DATA BEING COMPROMISED

03:28:46.680 --> 03:28:47.715
OR EXPORTED.

03:28:47.781 --> 03:28:49.884
VERSES YOU BEEN HACKED AND

03:28:49.950 --> 03:28:51.619
THERE'S A DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT

03:28:51.685 --> 03:28:52.686
YOU'VE BEEN HACKED AND MAYBE

03:28:52.753 --> 03:28:54.421
THEY WEREN'T APPROPRIATE CYBER

03:28:54.488 --> 03:28:56.190
PROTECTIONS.

03:28:56.257 --> 03:28:59.526
BUT LET'S REMEMBER FOLKS. ONE OF

03:28:59.593 --> 03:29:02.263
THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES HERE.

03:29:02.329 --> 03:29:04.632
IS THE WHOLESALE VIOLATION OF

03:29:04.698 --> 03:29:06.600
OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND POTENTIAL

03:29:06.667 --> 03:29:08.736
MEDICAL INFORMATION BEING

03:29:08.802 --> 03:29:10.638
SIPHONED CREDIT INFORMATION

03:29:10.704 --> 03:29:12.273
BEING.

03:29:12.339 --> 03:29:14.341
OBTAINED AND NEW SOCIAL SECURITY

03:29:14.408 --> 03:29:16.277
NUMBERS CREDIT CARD NUMBERS THIS

03:29:16.343 --> 03:29:18.045
IS WHERE WE CAN FACE VERY

03:29:18.112 --> 03:29:20.047
SERIOUS DAMAGES AND IT'S HARD TO

03:29:20.114 --> 03:29:22.683
PUT THE GENIE BACK IN THE BOX.

03:29:22.750 --> 03:29:25.252
IF IF MY CREDIT INFORMATION'S

03:29:25.319 --> 03:29:26.754
BEEN COMPROMISED FOR MY MEDICAL

03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:28.155
INFORMATION.

03:29:28.222 --> 03:29:29.089
WHAT'S THE RIGHT HOW DO YOU CURE

03:29:29.156 --> 03:29:31.258
THAT.

03:29:31.325 --> 03:29:32.993
YOU CAN'T PUT THAT GENIE BACK IN

03:29:33.060 --> 03:29:35.429
THE BOTTLE SO AGAIN I THINK WITH

03:29:35.496 --> 03:29:37.064
A LITTLE WORK WE COULD HAVE SOME

03:29:37.131 --> 03:29:38.766
CATEGORIES OF THE TYPES OF

03:29:38.832 --> 03:29:40.935
BREACH.

03:29:41.001 --> 03:29:43.103
AND POTENTIAL WOMEN'S ON SOME

03:29:43.170 --> 03:29:46.173
REMEDIES OR OR NOT.

03:29:46.240 --> 03:29:51.178
ON OTHER TYPES OF BREACHES -- SO.

03:29:51.245 --> 03:29:53.347
TO TURN ON THIS LONG COMMENTARY

03:29:53.414 --> 03:29:55.082
INTO A QUESTION.

03:29:55.149 --> 03:29:57.184
LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU

03:29:57.251 --> 03:30:02.990
AGREE WITH WHAT I'VE JUST SAID.

03:30:03.057 --> 03:30:03.924
YEAH.

03:30:03.991 --> 03:30:07.828
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU -- CAN ON A

03:30:07.895 --> 03:30:08.662
MORE SERIOUS NOTE HI.

MEETING TODAY AND I'VE HAD LONG

03:33:03.871 --> 03:33:05.372
CONVERSATIONS WITH -- WITH FOLKS

03:33:05.439 --> 03:33:06.473
ON BOTH SIDES OF CLEAN THE

03:33:06.540 --> 03:33:08.175
AUTHOR AND ALSO -- THE ATTORNEY

03:33:08.242 --> 03:33:10.010

03:33:10.077 --> 03:33:10.878
MYSELF VERTICALLY WITH THE

03:33:10.944 --> 03:33:12.646

HERE THERE THERE'S THERE'S A LOT

03:33:18.285 --> 03:33:20.154
A TO UNPACK WITH THIS -- WITH

03:33:20.220 --> 03:33:21.722
THIS ISSUE -- CENTER MONEY GOT

03:33:21.788 --> 03:33:22.322
SEE RIGHT THIS ULTIMATELY IS

03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:24.057
ABOUT CONSUMERS AND PROTECTING --

03:33:24.124 --> 03:33:24.992
GOOD CONSUMERS OF THE STATE OF

03:33:25.058 --> 03:33:26.393
CALIFORNIA THE ONLY THOUGH

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:27.928
COURSE LET'S REMEMBER THE REASON

03:33:27.995 --> 03:33:29.663
WHY WE HAVE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT

03:33:29.730 --> 03:33:31.932
PRIVACY ACT IN THIS AREA IN THE

03:33:31.999 --> 03:33:32.332
NATION.

03:33:32.399 --> 03:33:34.935
IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT --

03:33:35.002 --> 03:33:36.370
THIS MEASURE WAS BROUGHT FORWARD

03:33:36.436 --> 03:33:37.771
AS A POTENTIAL BALLOT MEASURE

03:33:37.838 --> 03:33:40.307
AND THE DEAL WAS STRUCK -- THAT --

03:33:40.374 --> 03:33:42.943
LED US TO THIS CURRENT ACT BOTH

03:33:43.010 --> 03:33:44.745
SIDES OF COURSE ARE NOW ENGAGING

03:33:44.811 --> 03:33:46.180
IN TRYING TO MAKE CHANGES. TO

03:33:46.246 --> 03:33:47.581
THE ACT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ALL

03:33:47.648 --> 03:33:50.250
A VERY DIFFICULT AN INTERESTING --

03:33:50.317 --> 03:33:51.919
BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT --

03:33:51.985 --> 03:33:53.654
THAT THAT THAT STRIKING A DEAL

03:33:53.720 --> 03:33:55.189
AS A PREFERABLE WAY OF MAKING

03:33:55.255 --> 03:33:57.391
POLICY IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF

03:33:57.457 --> 03:33:57.958
THE FACT THAT WHEN SOMETHING

03:33:58.025 --> 03:33:59.426
GOES THE BALLOT.

03:33:59.493 --> 03:34:01.328
EVEN IF IT PASSES IT AND HAS TO

03:34:01.395 --> 03:34:02.129
BE YOU CAN ONLY BE CHANGED WITH

03:34:02.196 --> 03:34:03.297
THE BALLOT MEASURE AND LET'S

03:34:03.363 --> 03:34:04.398
REMEMBER.

03:34:04.464 --> 03:34:06.500
THERE'S A REASON WHY BOTH SIDES

03:34:06.567 --> 03:34:07.701
DECIDED TO STRIKE THE DEAL

03:34:07.768 --> 03:34:09.303
PULLING OFTENTIMES SHOWS GREAT

03:34:09.369 --> 03:34:11.205
NUMBERS ON WONDERFUL PROGRESSIVE

03:34:11.271 --> 03:34:12.873
MEASURES AND GO DOWN TO DEFEAT.

03:34:12.940 --> 03:34:14.608
AFTER L. HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

03:34:14.675 --> 03:34:16.376
OF MONEY IS SPENT IN A BRUISING

03:34:16.443 --> 03:34:20.914
CAMPAIGN AND AND SO ALL SORTS OF

03:34:20.981 --> 03:34:23.083
THINGS CAN END UP -- YOU KNOW

03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:24.484
NOT WHERE WHERE THE ORIGINAL

03:34:24.551 --> 03:34:25.052
AUTHORS OF THOUGHT THEY WERE

03:34:25.118 --> 03:34:26.119
GOING TO BE -- WAS AND GOES TO

03:34:26.186 --> 03:34:26.787
THE MEASURE NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE

03:34:26.853 --> 03:34:27.387
BALLOT I THINK THAT'S PART OF

03:34:27.454 --> 03:34:28.889
WHY THE FOLKS WHO BROUGHT THE

03:34:28.956 --> 03:34:29.723
BALLOT MEASURE FOR IN THE FIRST

03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:31.325
PLACE -- WILLING TO STRIKE THE

03:34:31.391 --> 03:34:32.859
STEEL AND THE THING THAT YOU

03:34:32.926 --> 03:34:34.194
HEAR FROM EVERYBODY WAS INVOLVED

03:34:34.261 --> 03:34:35.395
IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.

03:34:35.462 --> 03:34:36.630
AND THE REASON WHY I THINK

03:34:36.697 --> 03:34:38.732
EVERYONE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE

03:34:38.799 --> 03:34:39.299
ISSUE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

03:34:39.366 --> 03:34:42.069
ACTION IS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE

03:34:42.135 --> 03:34:44.805
ABSOLUTE DEAL BREAKER -- FOR THE

03:34:44.871 --> 03:34:47.374
FOLKS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE AND

03:34:47.441 --> 03:34:49.276
THAT THE THE ONLY WAY WE WERE

03:34:49.343 --> 03:34:51.111
ABLE TO STRIKE A DEAL HERE AND

03:34:51.178 --> 03:34:55.115
AVOID A RIDICULOUS BATTLE --

03:34:55.182 --> 03:34:56.450
COME ELECTION TIME THAT COULD

03:34:56.516 --> 03:34:57.684
HAVE GONE AND YOU EITHER WAY AND

03:34:57.751 --> 03:34:59.219
WITH A CERTAINLY INVOLVED A TON

03:34:59.286 --> 03:35:02.689
OF MONEY SPEND THEN -- A LOT OF

03:35:02.756 --> 03:35:03.690
A DIFFICULT POLITICS.

03:35:03.757 --> 03:35:04.992
THE ONLY REASON WHY IS BECAUSE

03:35:05.058 --> 03:35:06.260
OF THE FACT THAT THIS PRIVATE

03:35:06.326 --> 03:35:07.261
RIGHT OF ACTION WAS STRIPPED.

03:35:07.327 --> 03:35:08.562
NOW.

03:35:08.629 --> 03:35:10.297
I UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE OTHER

03:35:10.364 --> 03:35:11.531
SAYING I UNDERSTAND THE ATTORNEY

03:35:11.598 --> 03:35:13.066

OFFICE UNDER THIS MEASURE --

03:35:18.705 --> 03:35:20.607
THOUGH I WILL SAY PART OF THE

03:35:20.674 --> 03:35:22.075
ANSWER TO THAT IS NO ONE WE JUST

03:35:22.142 --> 03:35:23.677
GIVEN MORE RESOURCES SO WE CAN

03:35:23.744 --> 03:35:25.579

03:36:31.111 --> 03:36:32.579
HONORED THAT THE PEOPLE WHEN

03:36:32.646 --> 03:36:34.147
THEY WHEN THEY COME TO NEGOTIATE

03:36:34.214 --> 03:36:34.948
HERE.

03:36:35.015 --> 03:36:39.252
pUNDER THAT THERE'S A SENSE THAT

03:36:39.319 --> 03:36:40.887
A DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK AND

03:36:40.954 --> 03:36:42.656
APPROVED BY OUR LEGISLATURE WILL

03:36:42.723 --> 03:36:44.524
ACTUALLY HAVE SOME MEANING -- IN

03:36:44.591 --> 03:36:46.560
THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE DEAL

03:36:46.626 --> 03:36:49.696
BEING STRUCK AND THEY DID THAT I

03:36:49.763 --> 03:36:51.231
THINK THAT BETTER PUBLIC POLICY

03:36:51.298 --> 03:36:53.600
WILL COME OUT OF THAT PROCESS AS

03:36:53.667 --> 03:36:55.736
A RESULT -- I I DO THINK THAT

03:36:55.802 --> 03:36:58.138
THE THE THE BALLOT ENDS UP BEING

03:36:58.205 --> 03:36:59.206
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT.

03:36:59.272 --> 03:37:00.807
YOU KNOW REMEDY IT'S IMPORTANT

03:37:00.874 --> 03:37:02.909
LEVER BUT BUT IT'S A TOTAL CRAP

03:37:02.976 --> 03:37:04.211
SHOOT AND IT ENDS UP --

03:37:04.277 --> 03:37:05.946
OFTENTIMES REWARDING THE FOLKS

03:37:06.012 --> 03:37:12.419
WHO ARE WILLING TO SPEND THE

03:37:12.486 --> 03:37:13.720
MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY AND MAKE

03:37:13.787 --> 03:37:14.621
THE MOST -- FRIGHTENING OF

03:37:14.688 --> 03:37:15.889
CLAIMS TO THE VOTERS AND VOTERS

03:37:15.956 --> 03:37:16.490
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE ENDED UP

03:37:16.556 --> 03:37:21.361
BEING SWAYED EVIDENCE OF THAT.

03:37:21.428 --> 03:37:23.897
SO I I ALSO UNDERSTAND THIS IS

03:37:23.964 --> 03:37:26.032
REALLY EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND

03:37:26.099 --> 03:37:27.634
I AND YOU KNOW I REALLY DO

03:37:27.701 --> 03:37:29.269
RESPECT THE CHAIR AND I RESPECT

03:37:29.336 --> 03:37:31.204
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- FOR

03:37:31.271 --> 03:37:32.406
THEIR WORK IN TRYING TO MAKE

03:37:32.472 --> 03:37:34.674
SURE THAT WE DO EFFECTUATE THE

03:37:34.741 --> 03:37:37.043
THE THE THE THE THE RIGHTS THAT

03:37:37.110 --> 03:37:38.845
ARE ENSHRINED IN THE C. C. PA I

03:37:38.912 --> 03:37:40.480
I AGREE DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN

03:37:40.547 --> 03:37:41.381
THE DAY AND I AGREE WE OUGHT TO

03:37:41.448 --> 03:37:42.416
BE A LOT MORE LIKE EUROPE.

03:37:42.482 --> 03:37:43.683
WHICH REALLY DOES HAVE A A

03:37:43.750 --> 03:37:46.553
ROBUST REGULATORY MECHANISM --

03:37:46.620 --> 03:37:47.454
YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOU

03:37:47.521 --> 03:37:48.688
HAVING MORE REGULATION FOR ME

THAT INVOLVES REALLY EMPOWERING --

03:37:51.258 --> 03:37:53.160
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN

03:37:53.226 --> 03:37:55.162

03:38:49.983 --> 03:38:51.218
ROAD EVEN TO GET TO THIS VERY

03:38:51.284 --> 03:38:52.385

THE POSSIBILITY OF ON WINDING

THE DEAL I THINK THERE'S JUST A

03:39:11.004 --> 03:39:13.073
LOT OF DOWNSIDES TO THAT.

03:39:13.139 --> 03:39:14.641

03:39:19.079 --> 03:39:20.413
LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD AND

03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:21.681
AND AND SO THAT THOSE ARE MY

03:39:21.748 --> 03:39:23.717
THOUGHTS ON THIS BILL.

OF THE CONCERNS AND SOME OF THE

03:39:38.498 --> 03:39:42.202
ENCOURAGING -- WORDS -- I HAVE A

03:39:42.269 --> 03:39:43.403
BIT OF A LIBERTARIAN STREAK IN

03:39:43.470 --> 03:39:44.971
ME YOU KNOW I WANT TO MAKE

03:39:45.038 --> 03:39:46.840

THAT WE PROMOTE ENTERPRISE --

03:39:48.708 --> 03:39:50.076
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN

03:39:50.143 --> 03:39:51.645
THAT INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR

03:39:51.711 --> 03:39:53.980
PRIVACY -- ARE LOOKED AFTER IN A

03:39:54.047 --> 03:39:55.482
CREDIBLE WAY.

03:39:55.549 --> 03:39:57.684
AND AS I'VE MENTIONED IN THIS

03:39:57.751 --> 03:39:58.184
COMMITTEE AND IN OTHER

03:39:58.251 --> 03:40:00.086
COMMITTEES THERE TENDS TO BE A

03:40:00.153 --> 03:40:02.222
BALANCE BECAUSE I THINK GOOD

03:40:02.289 --> 03:40:03.890
POLICY TENDS TO WAY.

03:40:03.957 --> 03:40:05.625
OF BOTH THE THE DOWNSIDES IN THE

03:40:05.692 --> 03:40:08.328
BENEFITS APPROPRIATELY.

03:40:08.395 --> 03:40:09.763
AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD -- THERE

03:40:09.829 --> 03:40:12.098
ARE A NUMBER OF BALANCING ACTS

03:40:12.165 --> 03:40:13.533
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:16.803
PROPOSED LEGISLATION -- THAT ARE --

03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:19.706
THAT HAVE MERIT -- I'M NOT

03:40:19.773 --> 03:40:21.041
CERTAIN THAT THERE IS THAT THE

03:40:21.107 --> 03:40:22.976
EQUILIBRIUM HAS BEEN ACHIEVED

03:40:23.043 --> 03:40:23.310
YET.

03:40:23.376 --> 03:40:25.745
AND SO I THINK -- WE HEARD IT --

03:40:25.812 --> 03:40:27.814
ADROITLY FROM -- CENTER ALLEN AT

03:40:27.881 --> 03:40:29.849
THAT -- THERE WAS A DEAL THAT

03:40:29.916 --> 03:40:31.418
WAS PUT FORWARD AND IT'S IN THE

03:40:31.484 --> 03:40:33.119
BEST INTERESTS OF THIS

03:40:33.186 --> 03:40:35.855
INSTITUTION TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

03:40:35.922 --> 03:40:37.724
INDIVIDUALS AND THAT MAKE

03:40:37.791 --> 03:40:40.126
ARRANGEMENTS -- WITH POLICY

03:40:40.193 --> 03:40:42.228
MAKERS -- HAVE THE CREDIBILITY

03:40:42.295 --> 03:40:45.131
TO CONTINUE MAKING -- THOSE

03:40:45.198 --> 03:40:47.834
TYPES OF NEGOTIATED OUTCOMES

03:40:47.901 --> 03:40:49.836
BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN IT WILL

03:40:49.903 --> 03:40:52.038
MAKE FOR BETTER POLICY -- IN

03:40:52.105 --> 03:40:53.239
THIS SITUATION I'M A LITTLE

03:40:53.306 --> 03:40:55.342
CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE

03:40:55.408 --> 03:40:59.713
ENFORCEMENT.

03:40:59.779 --> 03:41:00.614
BEFORE INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:41:00.680 --> 03:41:01.448
AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF

03:41:01.514 --> 03:41:03.149
THE FOLKS WHO TESTIFIED THAT

03:41:03.216 --> 03:41:03.984
THIS IS AN ART.

03:41:04.050 --> 03:41:07.187
COMING ONTO THE SCENE IN TILL.

03:41:07.253 --> 03:41:08.521
TWENTY TWENTY THAT WAS DESIGNED

03:41:08.588 --> 03:41:10.423
LAST YEAR FOR THIS PERIOD OF

03:41:10.490 --> 03:41:13.660
TIME ON THESE TWO YEARS -- FOR

03:41:13.727 --> 03:41:14.661
IT.

03:41:14.728 --> 03:41:17.330
THE MEAT TO BE PUT ON THE BONES.

03:41:17.397 --> 03:41:18.665
SO WE DON'T EVEN NECESSARILY

03:41:18.732 --> 03:41:21.468
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE

03:41:21.534 --> 03:41:23.770
YET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING.

03:41:23.837 --> 03:41:26.139
SLEDGE HAMMERS NGUYEN MAY BE A

03:41:26.206 --> 03:41:28.274
SMALLER DEVICE MIGHT BE MORE

03:41:28.341 --> 03:41:29.042
APPROPRIATE.

03:41:29.109 --> 03:41:30.810
I THINK THE IDEA THAT A

03:41:30.877 --> 03:41:34.481
REGULATOR CANNOT BE AN ENFORCER.

03:41:34.547 --> 03:41:36.816
DOESN'T GEL WITH HOW OUR SYSTEM

03:41:36.883 --> 03:41:38.818
ACROSS THE STATE IN THE NATION

03:41:38.885 --> 03:41:40.754
WORK WE HAVE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES

03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:41.354
WHERE.

03:41:41.421 --> 03:41:43.723
REGULATORS ARE INDEED ENFORCERS

03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:45.558
WHETHER BEYOND WALL STREET OR

03:41:45.625 --> 03:41:47.227
WHETHER IT BE WITH THE F. PPC

03:41:47.293 --> 03:41:48.728
YEAR.

03:41:48.795 --> 03:41:52.732
IT'S IT'S EVERYWHERE -- I

03:41:52.799 --> 03:41:55.001
PERSONALLY THINK THAT.

03:41:55.068 --> 03:41:57.170
THERE MIGHT BE A WAY FORWARD --

03:41:57.237 --> 03:41:59.105
WITH COMPLIANCE THAT DOES NOT

03:41:59.172 --> 03:42:01.408
CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

03:42:01.474 --> 03:42:03.843
BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED AS CENTER

03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:05.078
ON BURKE AND OTHERS HAVE

03:42:05.145 --> 03:42:06.246
DESCRIBED.

03:42:06.312 --> 03:42:08.415
THIS IS RED MEAT FOR TRIAL

03:42:08.481 --> 03:42:10.183
LAWYERS.

03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:11.418
AND THIS IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:42:11.484 --> 03:42:14.154
ON CLOGGING THE AG'S OFFICE WELL

03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:15.689
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

03:42:15.755 --> 03:42:17.257
CLOGGING THE JUDICIARY.

03:42:17.323 --> 03:42:18.725
THIS IS GOING.

03:42:18.792 --> 03:42:21.895
TO ALLOW FOR A RAVENOUS FRENZY --

03:42:21.961 --> 03:42:23.730
IF IT'LL IF IT MOVES FORWARD IN

03:42:23.797 --> 03:42:26.332
THIS TYPE OF FORM BUT GOING BACK

03:42:26.399 --> 03:42:28.034
TO WHAT YOU STATEDA CENTER

03:42:28.101 --> 03:42:28.835
JACKSON.

03:42:28.902 --> 03:42:32.305
YOUR INTENT IS NOT TO GO AFTER

03:42:32.372 --> 03:42:34.107
THE LITTLE GUY IT IS TO GO AFTER

03:42:34.174 --> 03:42:36.242
THE BIG GUY BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT

03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:38.044
YOU WANT TO DO.

03:42:38.111 --> 03:42:40.080
IS ACHIEVE CMPLIANCE NOT

03:42:40.146 --> 03:42:41.448
PUNISHMENT.

03:42:41.514 --> 03:42:42.415
AND SO IF THAT IS THE TRUE

03:42:42.482 --> 03:42:44.417
SPIRIT OF THIS PROPOSED

03:42:44.484 --> 03:42:46.853
LEGISLATION I THINK THERE'S A

03:42:46.920 --> 03:42:47.921
WAY FORWARD.

03:42:47.987 --> 03:42:51.458
OUR TO TO TO ACHIEVING THAT --

03:42:51.524 --> 03:42:53.226
ONE OF THE IDEAS IS THAT IF WE

03:42:53.293 --> 03:42:55.228
HAVE A THIRTY DAY -- REMEDY

03:42:55.295 --> 03:42:58.398
PERIOD -- ONE OF THE THINGSTHAT

03:42:58.465 --> 03:43:00.100
I'VE HEARD IN THE HALLWAYS WHICH

03:43:00.166 --> 03:43:01.801
IS NOT INITIALLY ABOUT IDEA IS.

03:43:01.868 --> 03:43:04.204
WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT.

03:43:04.270 --> 03:43:06.406
IN A PERFECT WORLD EXCEPT FOR ME

03:43:06.473 --> 03:43:07.073
THAT THERE'S NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF

03:43:07.140 --> 03:43:07.941
ACTION.

03:43:08.007 --> 03:43:10.844
UNTIL THERE'S A MOMENT IN TIME

03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:12.779
WE'RE COMPLIANCE HAS PROVEN

03:43:12.846 --> 03:43:15.782
ITSELF TO BE UNACHIEVABLE.

03:43:15.849 --> 03:43:18.218
NOW THAT'S NOT IN THIS PROPOSAL

03:43:18.284 --> 03:43:19.519
RIGHT HERE.

03:43:19.586 --> 03:43:21.354
THE OTHER THING IS I'M TERRIBLY

03:43:21.421 --> 03:43:24.824
CONCERNED THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL.

03:43:24.891 --> 03:43:27.494
OFFICER ORY DEPARTMENT WITHIN

03:43:27.560 --> 03:43:29.262
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:43:29.329 --> 03:43:31.064
HE'S PREEMPTIVELY [inaudible]

03:43:31.131 --> 03:43:33.133
SAYING THAT.

03:43:33.199 --> 03:43:35.135
THAT DEPARTMENT SHOULD NOT BEAR

03:43:35.201 --> 03:43:36.903
THE RESPONSIBILITY.

03:43:36.970 --> 03:43:39.572
OF DOING WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE

03:43:39.639 --> 03:43:41.241
TASKS IT TO DO.

03:43:41.307 --> 03:43:43.643
LAST TIME I CHECKED THAT'S NOT A

03:43:43.710 --> 03:43:47.080
THAT'S NOT A A A IN AN AUCTION

03:43:47.147 --> 03:43:48.515
NORMALLY GIVE INTO DERRY'S

03:43:48.581 --> 03:43:50.016
DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT.

03:43:50.083 --> 03:43:52.652
OF FOR FOR IN THIS CASE THE AG'S

03:43:52.719 --> 03:43:54.854
OFFICE AGES DOESN'T SEEM

03:43:54.921 --> 03:43:56.356
APPROPRIATE THAT A GOVERNMENT

03:43:56.422 --> 03:43:58.291
DEPARTMENT SAYS THIS IS TOO

03:43:58.358 --> 03:44:00.126
COMPLEX BURDENSOME POLITICALLY

03:44:00.193 --> 03:44:00.994
COSTLY.

03:44:01.060 --> 03:44:02.829
AND I DON'T WANT MY HANDS DIRTY

03:44:02.896 --> 03:44:05.465
BY IT I THINK THAT IS BAD POLICY

03:44:05.532 --> 03:44:07.133
IF WE ALLOW THAT TYPE OF

03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:08.268
PREEMPTION.

03:44:08.334 --> 03:44:10.270
DIS TO WEIGH IN ON OUR POLICY

03:44:10.336 --> 03:44:12.071
MAKING IT SHOULD BE BASED ON THE

03:44:12.138 --> 03:44:13.072
MERITS.

03:44:13.139 --> 03:44:15.742
AND OFF ALL CONCLUDE WITH WITH

03:44:15.809 --> 03:44:18.244
WITH THIS THAT.

03:44:18.311 --> 03:44:19.379
CENTER MONNING BROUGHT UP A

03:44:19.445 --> 03:44:20.647
COUPLE OF VERY GOOD POINTS.

03:44:20.713 --> 03:44:22.982
THAT GOING TO THE BALLOT IS MUCH

03:44:23.049 --> 03:44:24.250
MORE CUMBERSOME THAN GOING TO

03:44:24.317 --> 03:44:25.819
THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE'S AND

03:44:25.885 --> 03:44:27.220
THERE'S AN APP OPPORTUNITY TO

03:44:27.287 --> 03:44:28.555
REMEDY.

03:44:28.621 --> 03:44:30.824
THAT'S MORE EASY TO RELATE TO

03:44:30.890 --> 03:44:32.959
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAN THE

03:44:33.026 --> 03:44:34.060
BALLOT THAT IS VERY TRUE.

03:44:34.127 --> 03:44:36.029
I ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY

03:44:36.095 --> 03:44:38.131
THIS IS THE BEGINNING PIECE OF A

03:44:38.198 --> 03:44:39.799
PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

03:44:39.866 --> 03:44:41.935
I'VE HEARD THAT NOW GOING ON

03:44:42.001 --> 03:44:43.703
THREE MONTHS IN MY LIMITED

03:44:43.770 --> 03:44:45.138
TENURE HERE IN THE SENATE.

03:44:45.205 --> 03:44:47.407
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE.

03:44:47.473 --> 03:44:48.508
I BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BE

03:44:48.575 --> 03:44:51.411
BETTER SERVED IF.

03:44:51.477 --> 03:44:53.546
YOU WOULD CONSIDER BRINGING THIS

03:44:53.613 --> 03:44:56.349
ITEM BACK IN A REVISED FORM TO

03:44:56.416 --> 03:44:57.784
THIS VERY BODY.

03:44:57.851 --> 03:44:59.252
BECAUSE MOVING THIS ON TO THE

03:44:59.319 --> 03:45:01.688
NEXT COMMITTEE I THINK IS GOING

03:45:01.754 --> 03:45:05.124
TO SEND A SIGNAL AND FULLY IRATE.

03:45:05.191 --> 03:45:07.060
INDIVIDUALS THAT -- IT PROBABLY

03:45:07.126 --> 03:45:08.528
SHOULD BE OUR PARTNERS NOT

03:45:08.595 --> 03:45:10.096
NECESSARILY OUR ADVERSARIES I

03:45:10.163 --> 03:45:11.431
DON'T KNOW IF THAT SOMETHING

03:45:11.497 --> 03:45:12.565
THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER.

03:45:12.632 --> 03:45:14.567
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL

03:45:14.634 --> 03:45:17.237
MOVING THIS ITEM FOR TODAY BUT

03:45:17.303 --> 03:45:19.672
IF THERE WERE SOME SOME CHANGES

03:45:19.739 --> 03:45:21.875
MADE -- I THINK IT'S I THINK

03:45:21.941 --> 03:45:23.509
IT'S GOT REAL LEGS I THINK IT

03:45:23.576 --> 03:45:25.078
COULD BE DONE IN A TRULY

03:45:25.144 --> 03:45:29.382
pA THAT'S UP TO YOU NOT TO MOVE

03:45:29.449 --> 03:45:31.384
THIS FOR BUT TO BRING THIS ITEM

03:45:31.451 --> 03:45:32.785
BACK WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE --

03:45:32.852 --> 03:45:35.421
OF FORETHOUGHT WELL OBVIOUSLY I

03:45:35.488 --> 03:45:37.824
APPRECIATE THAT -- THE AS SHE

03:45:37.891 --> 03:45:41.327
WILL FIND OUT -- AGENCIES WAY IN

03:45:41.394 --> 03:45:43.796
ALL THE TIME ABOUT WHAT THEY

03:45:43.863 --> 03:45:45.798
THINK THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO FOR

03:45:45.865 --> 03:45:46.966
BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

03:45:47.033 --> 03:45:49.235
OF FREQUENTLY WE LISTEN TO THEM

03:45:49.302 --> 03:45:50.637
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR LIMITS

03:45:50.703 --> 03:45:52.005
BETTER THAN WE DO WHETHER THEY

03:45:52.071 --> 03:45:53.439
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PERSONNEL

03:45:53.506 --> 03:45:55.742
WHETHER IT SEEMS TO BE BEYOND

03:45:55.808 --> 03:45:57.677
THEIR EXPERTISE.

03:45:57.744 --> 03:46:00.113
AS FAR AS MY GOAL IS TO CONTINUE

03:46:00.179 --> 03:46:01.814
TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD.

03:46:01.881 --> 03:46:04.050
AND IT WILL GO TO A NUMBER OF

03:46:04.117 --> 03:46:07.453
OTHER COMMITTEES IN THE PROCESS --

03:46:07.520 --> 03:46:10.089
WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO

03:46:10.156 --> 03:46:13.226
CONSIDER IT -- TO CHANGE IT --

03:46:13.293 --> 03:46:15.461
AS APPROPRIATE I AM COMMITTED TO

03:46:15.528 --> 03:46:17.530
NEGOTIATING FURTHER AND TO I'M

03:46:17.597 --> 03:46:19.899
OPEN TO THE SUGGESTIONS THAT

03:46:19.966 --> 03:46:22.435
WE'VE HEARD TODAY -- I THINK

03:46:22.502 --> 03:46:24.304
THAT -- I KNOW THAT TO FOR SOME

03:46:24.370 --> 03:46:26.172
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

03:46:26.239 --> 03:46:29.642
WE EXPAND THE PUBLIC -- OF

03:46:29.709 --> 03:46:32.478
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM -- I DON'T

03:46:32.545 --> 03:46:33.947
SHARE WITH YOU THAT VIEW THAT

03:46:34.013 --> 03:46:35.381
WITH THIS WILL JUST SIMPLY BE

03:46:35.448 --> 03:46:37.083
RED MEAT AND AT THE COURTHOUSE

03:46:37.150 --> 03:46:38.651
DOORS WILL FLY OPEN.

03:46:38.718 --> 03:46:40.453
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS

03:46:40.520 --> 03:46:42.488
ENOUGH CONCERN HERE SO THAT I AM

03:46:42.555 --> 03:46:44.490
VERY OPEN TO FINDING OTHER

03:46:44.557 --> 03:46:51.264
ALTERNATIVES IF THAT IN FACT IS.

03:46:51.331 --> 03:46:53.099
IS A CONCERN THAT IS EXPRESSED

03:46:53.166 --> 03:46:53.533
BY.

03:46:53.599 --> 03:46:54.500
A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES BUT I

03:46:54.567 --> 03:46:55.501
DO WANT TO FIND THE ALTERNATIVE

03:46:55.568 --> 03:46:56.803
I DO WANT TO FIND THE WAY YES.

03:46:56.869 --> 03:46:58.504
YOU ARE CORRECT MY GOAL IS

03:46:58.571 --> 03:46:59.872
COMPLIANCE.

03:46:59.939 --> 03:47:01.441
MY GOAL IS PROTECTING THE

03:47:01.507 --> 03:47:02.542
PRIVACY RIGHTS OF ALL

03:47:02.608 --> 03:47:06.245
CALIFORNIANS AND SOMETIMES THAT

03:47:06.312 --> 03:47:07.513
HAPPENS WHEN YOU SIT DOWN WITH

03:47:07.580 --> 03:47:08.715
THE OF PEOPLE.

03:47:08.781 --> 03:47:11.451
BUT WE KNOW THAT IN THE IN THE

03:47:11.517 --> 03:47:13.553
THE WORLD OF FACEBOOK -- FOR

03:47:13.619 --> 03:47:15.421
EXAMPLE -- THERE HAVE BEEN

03:47:15.488 --> 03:47:18.558
PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES

03:47:18.624 --> 03:47:20.193
BROKEN EVERY STEP OF THE WAY

03:47:20.259 --> 03:47:22.495
INCLUDING SUCH OUTRAGEOUS THINGS

03:47:22.562 --> 03:47:24.664
AS A PULLING IN FOR IT IN

03:47:24.731 --> 03:47:27.300
INFORMATION -- THAT YOU OR THAT

03:47:27.367 --> 03:47:28.368
DOES SOME OF THE WOMEN I WILL

03:47:28.434 --> 03:47:30.737
USE THAT IN THAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE

03:47:30.803 --> 03:47:34.607
IT'S SO FOR OFFENSIVE BUT IT IS

03:47:34.674 --> 03:47:35.942
SO REAL.

03:47:36.009 --> 03:47:36.909
SO IS THERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE.

03:47:36.976 --> 03:47:38.111
WHO ARE IN THEIR CHILDBEARING

03:47:38.177 --> 03:47:39.245
YEARS?

03:47:39.312 --> 03:47:41.481
WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

03:47:41.547 --> 03:47:43.049
INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF

03:47:43.116 --> 03:47:45.451
PREGNANCY AND SO ON A FITBIT

03:47:45.518 --> 03:47:46.719
THEY WILL TAKE IN THEY WILL PUT

03:47:46.786 --> 03:47:48.588
IN THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND THE

03:47:48.654 --> 03:47:50.890
FITBIT WILL BE ABLE TO ADVISE

03:47:50.957 --> 03:47:53.092
HIM AS TO WHEN THEY'RE OVULATING?

03:47:53.159 --> 03:47:54.527
THAT INFORMATION IS NOW MADE

03:47:54.594 --> 03:47:56.829
AVAILABLE TO FACEBOOK.

03:47:56.896 --> 03:47:58.631
AND FACEBOOK KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE

03:47:58.698 --> 03:47:59.532
OVULATING.

03:47:59.599 --> 03:48:01.534
WHEN YOUR OVULATION STOPS THERE

03:48:01.601 --> 03:48:03.036
FOR YOU ARE PREGNANT AND IT

03:48:03.102 --> 03:48:04.804
STARTS FEEDING INFORMATION TO

03:48:04.871 --> 03:48:07.340
WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT WHO MAY

03:48:07.407 --> 03:48:11.344
NOT EVEN HAVE FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS?

03:48:11.411 --> 03:48:13.112
FIVE INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT

03:48:13.179 --> 03:48:15.048
POLITICAL POINTS OF VIEW ON HOW

03:48:15.114 --> 03:48:16.182
TO RAISE CHILDREN.

03:48:16.249 --> 03:48:18.217
OF PRODUCTS TO BUY IN THIS IS

03:48:18.284 --> 03:48:19.619
COMING TO PEOPLE WITHOUT EVEN

03:48:19.685 --> 03:48:22.188
HAVING THIS THE FAINTEST CLUE.

03:48:22.255 --> 03:48:24.123
THAT THEIR INFORMATION MOST

03:48:24.190 --> 03:48:25.925
PERSONAL INFORMATION.

03:48:25.992 --> 03:48:27.927
HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A COMPANY THAT

03:48:27.994 --> 03:48:29.862
THEN USES IT TO THEIR FINANCIAL

03:48:29.929 --> 03:48:31.664
ADVANTAGE AND THAT IS THE KIND

03:48:31.731 --> 03:48:33.166
OF THING THAT WE'RE SEEING.

03:48:33.232 --> 03:48:35.368
AND SO THERE IS A BALANCE THERE

03:48:35.435 --> 03:48:37.070
SOMEWHERE I HOPE AND I ALSO

03:48:37.136 --> 03:48:38.971
SHARE A SORT OF LIBERTARIAN

03:48:39.038 --> 03:48:40.206
STREAK WITH YOU.

03:48:40.273 --> 03:48:42.608
TO US SO I AM COMMITTED I AM

03:48:42.675 --> 03:48:47.246
COMMITTED -- TO TO BRINGING A

03:48:47.313 --> 03:48:48.681
TOGETHER I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

03:48:48.748 --> 03:48:50.316
THE STAKEHOLDERS COME HERE AND

03:48:50.383 --> 03:48:52.251
TALK I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW

03:48:52.318 --> 03:48:54.821
THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING -- AND

03:48:54.887 --> 03:48:57.323
WANTED TO SAY -- TO SENATOR

03:48:57.390 --> 03:48:58.091
ALLEN.

03:48:58.157 --> 03:48:59.459
I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER I DON'T

03:48:59.525 --> 03:49:00.426
KNOW IF YOU WERE IN THE ROOM

03:49:00.493 --> 03:49:03.729
THAT THERE ARE ANYWHERE FROM

03:49:03.796 --> 03:49:05.898
EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BILLS.

03:49:05.965 --> 03:49:06.499
EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BILLS

03:49:06.566 --> 03:49:08.835
CURRENTLY IN THE LEGISLATURE BY

03:49:08.901 --> 03:49:11.070
THE INDUSTRY'S TRYING TO CHANGE

03:49:11.137 --> 03:49:13.206
THIS DEAL. TO SET THIS

03:49:13.272 --> 03:49:14.774
SACROSANCT DEAL.

03:49:14.841 --> 03:49:16.342
THEY DON'T LIKE IT AND SO THEY

03:49:16.409 --> 03:49:17.910
WANT TO CHANGE IT.

03:49:17.977 --> 03:49:20.246
AND MICHAEL HERE'S SIDE AS I

03:49:20.313 --> 03:49:21.347
SAID.

03:49:21.414 --> 03:49:22.482
IT IS NOT TO CHANGE THE

03:49:22.548 --> 03:49:23.983
SUBSTANCE BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT%

03:49:24.050 --> 03:49:26.018
WE ACTUALLY CAN ENFORCE THIS

03:49:26.085 --> 03:49:28.087
ARRANGEMENT -- SO I APPRECIATE

03:49:28.154 --> 03:49:30.223
YOUR CONCERNS I AM COMMITTED TO

03:49:30.289 --> 03:49:33.126
CONTINUING TO WORK THIS MEASURE.

03:49:33.192 --> 03:49:36.429
AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- AND

03:49:36.496 --> 03:49:37.964
WOULD LIKE TO ALSO REMIND THE

03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:39.599
GOOD SENATOR WE HAD TO I THINK

03:49:39.665 --> 03:49:42.034
OUR FIRST OR SECOND BILL TODAY

03:49:42.101 --> 03:49:43.669
WHICH FEELS LIKE IT WAS --

03:49:43.736 --> 03:49:46.105
STARTED YESTERDAY MORNING -- WAS

03:49:46.172 --> 03:49:47.740
A BILL THAT COMPLETELY --

03:49:47.807 --> 03:49:49.442
MODIFIES A MEASURE THAT WE

03:49:49.509 --> 03:49:51.110
PASSED IN VOTED ON ANDALL

03:49:51.177 --> 03:49:53.579
AGREED TO LAST YEAR BY SENATOR

03:49:53.646 --> 03:49:54.981
WIENER.

03:49:55.047 --> 03:49:56.215
BROUGHT BACK A BILL.

03:49:56.282 --> 03:49:59.852
ON THE LPS ISSUE -- BECAUSE HE

03:49:59.919 --> 03:50:00.920
DIDN'T LIKE THE BILL THAT

03:50:00.987 --> 03:50:02.255
HAPPENED LAST YEAR.

03:50:02.321 --> 03:50:04.657
AND WE HEARD HIM TODAY AND WE

03:50:04.724 --> 03:50:06.859
MADE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND WE

03:50:06.926 --> 03:50:08.728
PASSED OUT THE BILL BECAUSE IT

03:50:08.794 --> 03:50:10.396
WAS BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD.

03:50:10.463 --> 03:50:11.797
AND I THINK THAT IF WE KEEP THAT

03:50:11.864 --> 03:50:13.366
IN MIND.

03:50:13.432 --> 03:50:15.001
AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN GOOD FAITH

03:50:15.067 --> 03:50:17.036
TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS REALLY

03:50:17.103 --> 03:50:18.804
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM -- THAT IS

03:50:18.871 --> 03:50:20.773
TAKEN OVER WE CAN COME TO A

03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:24.644
RESOLUTION THANK YOU SENATOR

03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:26.979
JACKSON'S -- WHAT CASKEY?

03:50:27.046 --> 03:50:27.547
WE HAVEN'T HAD MANY.

03:50:27.613 --> 03:50:29.081
WE HAVEN'T HAD MANY ISSUES ON

03:50:29.148 --> 03:50:30.483
THE BALLOT BECAUSE IT'S JUST

03:50:30.550 --> 03:50:32.718
BEEN VERY RECENTLY THAT WE HAVE

03:50:32.785 --> 03:50:33.653
THAT.

03:50:33.719 --> 03:50:35.755

THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE

03:55:06.459 --> 03:55:08.894
SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS RATHER THAN

03:55:08.961 --> 03:55:10.262
EFFORTS JUST TO KILL THE BILL.

03:55:10.329 --> 03:55:11.730

THERE -- BUT BY VIRTUE OF THE

03:55:51.203 --> 03:55:52.771
WAY THE INDUSTRY IS BEHAVING NOW

03:55:52.838 --> 03:55:54.740
THEY CLEARLY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT

THEY WERE GOING TO COMPLY WITH

03:55:55.441 --> 03:55:56.909

ANTICIPATION OF ESTIMATED THREE

04:00:51.770 --> 04:00:53.238

THREE POSITIONS THAT WOULD.

04:01:40.819 --> 04:01:41.386
NO YOU'RE RIGHT OKAY THAT WAS

04:01:41.453 --> 04:01:41.620
RIGHT.

04:01:41.687 --> 04:01:43.589
ON THE TWENTY THREE POSITIONS

04:01:43.655 --> 04:01:45.290

PA.

04:01:54.099 --> 04:01:56.335
AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL - A

04:01:56.401 --> 04:01:57.736
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE

04:01:57.803 --> 04:01:59.805
DOING ON GOING REGULATIONS

04:01:59.872 --> 04:02:01.740
BECAUSE THE CCPA AUTHORIZED

04:02:01.807 --> 04:02:03.642
TRAIN GENERAL TO DO REGULATIONS

04:02:03.709 --> 04:02:05.444
ON AN ONGOING BASIS NOT JUST IN

04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:07.312
ORDER -- TO PROMULGATE

04:02:07.379 --> 04:02:09.047
REGULATIONS.

04:02:09.114 --> 04:02:11.683
UNDER POINT.

04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:12.284
ONE EIGHT FIVE FIVE DIED JULY

04:02:12.351 --> 04:02:14.319
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE WAS

04:02:14.386 --> 04:02:15.954
A WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LOOKING

04:02:16.021 --> 04:02:17.756
AT YOU KNOW A MULTITUDE OF

04:02:17.823 --> 04:02:24.630
RESPONSIBILITIES AT THAT THE CPA --

04:02:24.696 --> 04:02:25.764
ENTERS IN THE AG IN TERMS OF

04:02:25.831 --> 04:02:26.531
MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN

04:02:26.598 --> 04:02:28.100
ADEQUATELY ENFORCE.

04:02:28.166 --> 04:02:29.101
IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR

04:02:29.167 --> 04:02:31.069
QUESTION -- I THINK THE THE

04:02:31.136 --> 04:02:33.438
ISSUE HERE IS THAT THERE'S FORTY

04:02:33.505 --> 04:02:34.940
MILLION CALIFORNIANS.

04:02:35.007 --> 04:02:37.876
AND THE SCOPE OF BUSINESSES THAT

04:02:37.943 --> 04:02:39.511
THE CZ P. APPLIES TO IS

04:02:39.578 --> 04:02:40.846
SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE.

04:02:40.913 --> 04:02:46.485
AND SO IN ORDER -- TO TO TO HAVE

04:02:46.551 --> 04:02:47.920
THE RESOURCES AND THE NEED TO

04:02:47.986 --> 04:02:49.955
AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THAT

04:02:50.022 --> 04:02:50.856
BUSINESSES ARE COMPLYING WITH

04:02:50.923 --> 04:02:52.491
THE LAW ON BEHALF OF ALL THOSE

04:02:52.557 --> 04:02:53.892
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

04:02:53.959 --> 04:02:55.894
IT WOULD BE CAN A CONSIDERABLE

04:02:55.961 --> 04:02:58.530
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE POWER RIGHT TO

04:02:58.597 --> 04:02:59.498
MAKING SURE THAT.

04:02:59.564 --> 04:03:00.999
THAT.

04:03:01.066 --> 04:03:03.402
THAT THERE'S RESPONSES TO PUBLIC

04:03:03.468 --> 04:03:05.037
COMPLAINTS OR WHISTLE BLOWERS OR

04:03:05.103 --> 04:03:05.938
YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT

04:03:06.004 --> 04:03:07.105
INVESTIGATIONS THAT MIGHT TAKE

04:03:07.172 --> 04:03:08.307
PLACE AND FIND OUT THAT

04:03:08.373 --> 04:03:09.708
COMPANIES ARE SELLING

04:03:09.775 --> 04:03:11.209
INFORMATION WHEN WHEN.

04:03:11.276 --> 04:03:12.644
CONSUMERS HAVE OPTED OUT FOR

04:03:12.711 --> 04:03:14.479
EXAMPLE AND SO I THINK THAT THAT

04:03:14.546 --> 04:03:16.248
THE THE THE REASON THAT THE

04:03:16.315 --> 04:03:18.183
PEORIA SO IMPORTANT HERE IS

04:03:18.250 --> 04:03:19.685
BECAUSE IT PROVIDES CRITICAL

04:03:19.751 --> 04:03:21.253
ADJUNCT. TO DO WORK AT THE

04:03:21.320 --> 04:03:22.387
ATTORNEY GENERAL SO YOU KNOW

04:03:22.454 --> 04:03:24.456
THERE IT WOULD WORK IN PARALLEL

04:03:24.523 --> 04:03:26.158
IN TERMS OF NSURING THAT THE

04:03:26.224 --> 04:03:29.261
LAW IS ENFORCED AND IT ALSO OAK

04:03:29.328 --> 04:03:30.495
PROVIDE FOR THAT THIS

04:03:30.562 --> 04:03:31.396
GROUNDBREAKING LAW THAT

04:03:31.463 --> 04:03:33.198
CONSUMERS NOW HAVE THE ABILITY

04:03:33.265 --> 04:03:34.166
TO CONTROL.

04:03:34.232 --> 04:03:36.134
HOW THEIR INFORMATION IS USED

04:03:36.201 --> 04:03:38.236
AND AND WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY --

04:03:38.303 --> 04:03:39.638
CAN RETAIN INFORMATION BY

04:03:39.705 --> 04:03:41.506
FACTORING THE RIGHT TO DELETE

04:03:41.573 --> 04:03:42.040
AND WHATNOT.

04:03:42.107 --> 04:03:44.576
YOU KNOW TO PROVIDE THOSE RIGHTS

04:03:44.643 --> 04:03:45.644
AND THEN STATE BUT YOU CAN FORCE

04:03:45.711 --> 04:03:47.245
THEM IF IF A COMPANY DOESN'T

04:03:47.312 --> 04:03:48.447
COMPLY YOU KNOW THAT IS JUST

04:03:48.513 --> 04:03:50.248
ALSO ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS

04:03:50.315 --> 04:03:50.749
AS WELL.

04:03:50.816 --> 04:03:53.318
SO JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF

04:03:53.385 --> 04:03:56.021
OF MORE -- COLOR TO WHAT THE

04:03:56.088 --> 04:03:56.922
TWENTY THREE POSITIONS ARE THAT

04:03:56.989 --> 04:03:58.890
WE'RE SEEKING -- TO THAT THAT'S

04:03:58.957 --> 04:04:01.126
IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY.

04:04:01.193 --> 04:04:02.627
AND AND ALSO I JUST I DO WANT TO

04:04:02.694 --> 04:04:03.495
POINT OUT THAT AND I MAY BE

04:04:03.562 --> 04:04:05.464
WRONG I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON GPR

04:04:05.530 --> 04:04:06.765
I'M SURE THAT.

04:04:06.832 --> 04:04:07.632
THERE ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN

04:04:07.699 --> 04:04:09.267
THIS ROOM THAT PROBABLY COULD

04:04:09.334 --> 04:04:11.403
SPEAK TO IT BUT I I THINK THAT

04:04:11.470 --> 04:04:12.437
IN IRELAND IF I'M CORRECT THAT

04:04:12.504 --> 04:04:13.972
THE DPA IS A HUNDRED AND TEN

04:04:14.039 --> 04:04:16.842
PEOPLE FOR FOUR POINT EIGHT

04:04:16.908 --> 04:04:18.310
MILLION POPULATION SO THAT THAT.

04:04:18.377 --> 04:04:20.178
BACK PRESHOW INTERNET IN ITSELF

04:04:20.245 --> 04:04:22.314
WAY UNDERSTAFFED WE AND OUR

04:04:22.381 --> 04:04:23.181
STAFF HERE.

04:04:23.248 --> 04:04:25.550
AND SO IS THERE ACTUALLY CAN YOU

04:04:25.617 --> 04:04:27.119
FLESH THAT CAN ONE OF YOU FIRST

04:04:27.185 --> 04:04:27.786
THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAD EXPERIENCE

04:04:27.853 --> 04:04:30.055
WITH G. D. P. R. IMPLEMENTATION

04:04:30.122 --> 04:04:31.223
YES.

04:04:31.289 --> 04:04:38.930
SO IS IS IS THE TRAINING

04:04:38.997 --> 04:04:39.564
GENERAL'S OFFICE RIGHT IN TERMS

04:04:39.631 --> 04:04:40.565
OF JUST.

04:04:40.632 --> 04:04:41.733
LEVEL OF WOMAN AND MAN POWER

04:04:41.800 --> 04:04:43.902
BEING THROWN IT IMPLEMENTATION

04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:44.569
RIGHT FEET THERE IS AN

04:04:44.636 --> 04:04:45.537
INVESTMENT IN AN INCREASE IN THE

04:04:45.604 --> 04:04:46.671
NUMBER THE DATA PROTECTION

04:04:46.738 --> 04:04:47.305
AUTHORITY PROVIDES THREE THIRTY

04:04:47.372 --> 04:04:49.141
OFFICES TO INCREASE STAFF. TO

04:04:49.207 --> 04:04:50.742
DEAL WITH -- GPR AND AND AND

04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:51.777
AGAIN THAT'S LED TO THE

04:04:51.843 --> 04:04:52.511
COMPLAINTS CULTURE THAT THEY ARE

04:04:52.577 --> 04:04:54.112
INCULCATED IN EUROPE WHERE

04:04:54.179 --> 04:04:55.747
COMPANIES CAN GET THE NOTICE THE

04:04:55.814 --> 04:04:56.481
ADVICE.

04:04:56.548 --> 04:04:58.817
THE GUIDANCE THAT THEY NEED TO

04:04:58.884 --> 04:05:00.285
BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW

04:05:00.352 --> 04:05:01.853
BECAUSE THEY ULTIMATELY THE GOAL

04:05:01.920 --> 04:05:04.022
IS TO COMPLY AND TO ARRIVE AT A

04:05:04.089 --> 04:05:05.624
POINT WHERE THERE WE REACH A

04:05:05.690 --> 04:05:07.092
COMPLIANCE CULTURE AS IT RELATES

04:05:07.159 --> 04:05:08.026
TO THESE TOPICS.

04:05:08.093 --> 04:05:09.728
GUIDANCE IS NEEDED PARTICULARLY

04:05:09.795 --> 04:05:12.197
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ENTIRE

04:05:12.264 --> 04:05:13.331
INFRASTRUCTURE NEW BUSINESS

04:05:13.398 --> 04:05:14.699
SYSTEMS THAT NEED TO BE PUT IN

04:05:14.766 --> 04:05:16.968
PLACE ON AN ENTERPRISE WIDE

04:05:17.035 --> 04:05:18.370
LEVEL GLOBAL LEVEL.

04:05:18.437 --> 04:05:20.405
SO THESE ARE AS IMPORTANT STEPS

04:05:20.472 --> 04:05:22.307
TO TAKE TIME AND COMPANIES ARE

04:05:22.374 --> 04:05:23.241
GOING THROUGH IT VERY

04:05:23.308 --> 04:05:24.876
THOUGHTFULLY I AS I MENTIONED IN

04:05:24.943 --> 04:05:27.179
MY OPENING I TRAINED OVER

04:05:27.245 --> 04:05:27.779
FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUSINESS AGAIN

04:05:27.846 --> 04:05:28.480
EXECUTIVES.

04:05:28.547 --> 04:05:30.048
AT CONFERENCES ACROSS THE

04:05:30.115 --> 04:05:31.616
COUNTRY THEY ARE FLOCKING TO

04:05:31.683 --> 04:05:33.085
UNDERSTAND THIS LAW AND TO

04:05:33.151 --> 04:05:34.820
FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT

04:05:34.886 --> 04:05:36.154
AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE

04:05:36.221 --> 04:05:38.323
TEAMS HAVE SEVENTY PEOPLE IN OUR

04:05:38.390 --> 04:05:39.491
PRIVACY DATA SECURITY GROUP AT

04:05:39.558 --> 04:05:40.592
AT PERKINS COOLEY.

04:05:40.659 --> 04:05:42.160
WE HAVE TEAMS OF US TRYING TO

04:05:42.227 --> 04:05:43.562
UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE

04:05:43.628 --> 04:05:44.996
INTRICACIES TO THE SO THAT WE

04:05:45.063 --> 04:05:46.731
CAN PROPERLY ADVISE CLIENTS NOT

04:05:46.798 --> 04:05:48.900
AS A WAY TO GET AROUND THE LAB

04:05:48.967 --> 04:05:50.869
IS A WE TO COMPLY IN THE SPIRIT

04:05:50.936 --> 04:05:52.304
OF CULTURAL COMPLIANCE.

04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:53.805
THEY WERE DISCUSSING AND AND

04:05:53.872 --> 04:05:54.706
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I'M

04:05:54.773 --> 04:05:56.408
ACTUALLY I'M NOT EVEN WORRIED

04:05:56.475 --> 04:06:02.214
ABOUT THOSE FOLKS I'M WORRIED

04:06:02.280 --> 04:06:02.848
ABOUT THE FOLKS WHO CAN'T AFFORD

04:06:02.914 --> 04:06:03.482
YOU.

04:06:03.548 --> 04:06:04.583
EXACTLY AS HE MAKES IT WORSE FOR

04:06:04.649 --> 04:06:05.584
THEM SO YOU KNOW TO CREATE THE

04:06:05.650 --> 04:06:06.251
GUIDANCE THAT GUIDES CAN BE USED

04:06:06.318 --> 04:06:07.953
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS

04:06:08.019 --> 04:06:09.354
TO LEARN UNDERSTOOD SO.

04:06:09.421 --> 04:06:11.289
JACKSON I JUST HEARD MADAM CHAIR

04:06:11.356 --> 04:06:13.258
I'M SORRY -- I KNOW USE YOU

04:06:13.325 --> 04:06:14.326
EXPRESSED OPENNESS ON THIS THIS

04:06:14.392 --> 04:06:16.795
OTHER STRATEGY CITY ATTORNEY.

04:06:16.862 --> 04:06:18.763
D. A THAT SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED

04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:20.632
CONCEPT THIS REGULATORY APPROACH

04:06:20.699 --> 04:06:22.968
THOUGH AND MAYBE IT'S NOT IN D.

04:06:23.034 --> 04:06:25.170
O. J. PER SE I MEAN I I'VE BEEN

04:06:25.237 --> 04:06:27.572
THINKING ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF

04:06:27.639 --> 04:06:30.041
BUSINESS OVERSIGHT.

04:06:30.108 --> 04:06:31.409
IS THEIR OPENNESS.

04:06:31.476 --> 04:06:32.043
TO THINKING ABOUT THAT ARE YOU

04:06:32.110 --> 04:06:33.912
ARE YOU WON'T.

04:06:33.979 --> 04:06:36.014
IS YOUR SORT OF PREMISE THAT --

04:06:36.081 --> 04:06:36.948
THERE NEEDS TO BE A SORT OF A

04:06:37.015 --> 04:06:39.050
LITIGATION BASE FRAMEWORK TO

04:06:39.117 --> 04:06:40.952
REALLY MAKE INFO FOR CEMENT WORK

04:06:41.019 --> 04:06:43.455
HERE MY MY PREMISE AND MY GOAL

04:06:43.522 --> 04:06:45.657
IS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.

04:06:45.724 --> 04:06:47.792
AND SO IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN

04:06:47.859 --> 04:06:49.694
DO THAT FOR EXAMPLE OFFICE OF

04:06:49.761 --> 04:06:52.464
BUSINESS OVERSIGHT I CAN ASSURE

04:06:52.531 --> 04:06:53.265
YOU DOESN'T HAVE.

04:06:53.331 --> 04:06:55.467
DOESN'T HAVE THE THE ABILITY TO

04:06:55.534 --> 04:06:57.769
DO THIS BUT AND IN TO CREATE A

04:06:57.836 --> 04:07:01.540
NEW -- THE A NEW MECHANISM MAY

04:07:01.606 --> 04:07:03.708
BE DOABLE OR NOT.

04:07:03.775 --> 04:07:05.243
BUT WE DO HAVE CERTAIN THINGS

04:07:05.310 --> 04:07:06.845
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN

04:07:06.912 --> 04:07:08.513
TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US

04:07:08.580 --> 04:07:09.848
NOW.

04:07:09.915 --> 04:07:11.483
THAT I WANT TO EXPLORE BOB

04:07:11.550 --> 04:07:13.952
BECAUSE ENFORCEMENT IS

04:07:14.019 --> 04:07:15.587
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I SUSPECT

04:07:15.654 --> 04:07:18.857
MANY COMPANIES DO WANT TO COMPLY --

04:07:18.924 --> 04:07:20.859
BUT LIKE ANYTHING IF YOU DON'T

04:07:20.926 --> 04:07:22.794
HAVE.

04:07:22.861 --> 04:07:24.162
THE INCENTIVE.

04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:26.464
OR AND AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE

04:07:26.531 --> 04:07:28.366
CONSEQUENCES MOST BUSINESSES

04:07:28.433 --> 04:07:30.535
OPERATE ON A RISK ANALYSIS.

04:07:30.602 --> 04:07:34.639
IS THERE A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

04:07:34.706 --> 04:07:37.576
MY NOT COMPLYING -- IN IF THE

04:07:37.642 --> 04:07:38.643
ANSWER IS NO THEN WE'RE NOT THIS

04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:40.178
LIKELY TO GET COMPLIANCE AS WE

04:07:40.245 --> 04:07:42.747
ARE IF THERE IS A LEGITIMATE

04:07:42.814 --> 04:07:44.216
RISK IN THAT RISK WOULD BE.

04:07:44.282 --> 04:07:46.284
LITIGATION THAT RISK COULD BE

04:07:46.351 --> 04:07:48.153
REGULATION WHICH I THINK WE'RE

04:07:48.220 --> 04:07:50.322
GOING TO GET ANYWAY THE AGE SHE

04:07:50.388 --> 04:07:51.957
IS WORKING ON REGULATION.

04:07:52.023 --> 04:07:54.593
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE

04:07:54.659 --> 04:07:57.362
WILD WEST -- BUT I'M CERTAINLY

04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:59.464
OPEN TO AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO

04:07:59.531 --> 04:08:01.933
TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT A

04:08:02.000 --> 04:08:04.236
METHOD THEY FEEL WOULD GET US TO

04:08:04.302 --> 04:08:06.004
THE GOAL WHICH IS TO GET

04:08:06.071 --> 04:08:07.205
COMPLIANCE.

04:08:07.272 --> 04:08:08.640
AND I'M NOT JUST FOR THE BIG

04:08:08.707 --> 04:08:12.177
GUYS RIGHT I MEAN NO NOT FOR THE

04:08:12.244 --> 04:08:13.812
NO NO NO NO NO.

04:08:13.878 --> 04:08:15.247
SO SO I CAN TELL YOU WE'VE DONE

04:08:15.313 --> 04:08:16.848
THIS I I WILL USE AS A SIMPLE

04:08:16.915 --> 04:08:18.950
ANALOGY WHEN I DID MY

04:08:19.017 --> 04:08:22.087
LEGISLATION ON EQUAL PAY.

04:08:22.153 --> 04:08:22.887
THERE WAS THIS BIG CONCERN WHAT

04:08:22.954 --> 04:08:24.256
IS SHIP MEAN WE'VE GOT ALL THESE

04:08:24.322 --> 04:08:26.057
DIFFERENT RULES AND WE'VE GOT

04:08:26.124 --> 04:08:27.125
DIFFERENT CRITERIA.

04:08:27.192 --> 04:08:28.226
WE BROUGHT TOGETHER ALL THE

04:08:28.293 --> 04:08:30.996
STAKE HOLDERS AND WE NOW HAVE A

04:08:31.062 --> 04:08:33.898
A WORKING OF VIABLE.

04:08:33.965 --> 04:08:36.601
A PROCEDURE BY WHICH COMPANIES

04:08:36.668 --> 04:08:38.303
BIG AND SMALL.

04:08:38.370 --> 04:08:41.640
CAN GET THATKIND OF DIRECTION

04:08:41.706 --> 04:08:43.174
THROUGH EGGS EXISTING.

04:08:43.241 --> 04:08:44.976
OF AN EXISTING FRAMEWORK THAT

04:08:45.043 --> 04:08:46.678
WAS CREATED WITH THE

04:08:46.745 --> 04:08:48.813
STAKEHOLDERS COMINGTOGETHER --

04:08:48.880 --> 04:08:51.249
WITH A A NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT --

04:08:51.316 --> 04:08:52.417
BUSINESS SHOULD COMMUNITY THE

04:08:52.484 --> 04:08:54.286
CHAMBER GOT INVOLVED IN IT AND

04:08:54.352 --> 04:08:54.519
OTHERS.

04:08:54.586 --> 04:08:56.621
AND I LIKE I LIKE THAT IDEA TO

04:08:56.688 --> 04:08:58.456
WORKING AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO

04:08:58.523 --> 04:09:00.959
CONSIDER THAT BUT THERE IS ALSO

04:09:01.026 --> 04:09:03.028
AN ILL -- AND IMPLEMENTATION

04:09:03.094 --> 04:09:05.196
MECHANISM THAT EXISTS IN PERHAPS

04:09:05.263 --> 04:09:07.065
THAT'S WHERE WE LOOK AT CITY

04:09:07.132 --> 04:09:09.367
ATTORNEYS AND DH THERE HAS TO BE.

04:09:09.434 --> 04:09:11.636
THERE HAS TO BE A VIABLE WAY TO

04:09:11.703 --> 04:09:12.671
ENFORCE.

04:09:12.737 --> 04:09:14.139
AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

04:09:14.205 --> 04:09:15.340
LOOKING AT HERE I ALSO WANT TO

04:09:15.407 --> 04:09:16.408
POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW THE

04:09:16.474 --> 04:09:18.243
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THE

04:09:18.310 --> 04:09:19.244
PRIVACY UNIT SITS IN THE

04:09:19.311 --> 04:09:20.378
CONSUMER THE CONSUMER LAW

04:09:20.445 --> 04:09:21.479
SECTION.

04:09:21.546 --> 04:09:24.316
THAT WE ARE WERE TASKED WITH

04:09:24.382 --> 04:09:26.718
ENFORCING STATE AND FEDERAL.

04:09:26.785 --> 04:09:28.253
CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AS IT

04:09:28.320 --> 04:09:30.555
RELATES TO CALIFORNIANS PRIVACY

04:09:30.622 --> 04:09:32.157
AND ALTHOUGH.

04:09:32.223 --> 04:09:34.159
I SUPERVISE A A SMALL TEAM OF

04:09:34.225 --> 04:09:35.960
MODEST TEAM WITHIN THE UNIT --

04:09:36.027 --> 04:09:38.196
YOU KNOW WE HAVE BROUGHT ACTIONS

04:09:38.263 --> 04:09:39.764
AGAINST COMPANIES FOR VIOLATING

04:09:39.831 --> 04:09:41.199
THOSE RATES -- SINCE THE

04:09:41.266 --> 04:09:43.101
INCEPTION OF THE OF OF THE UNIT

04:09:43.168 --> 04:09:44.803
WAS CREATED AND SO ENFORCEMENT

04:09:44.869 --> 04:09:48.306
IS A A VERY IMPORTANT WAY OF

04:09:48.373 --> 04:09:50.241
ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES DO

04:09:50.308 --> 04:09:52.310
COMPLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW -- THAT

04:09:52.377 --> 04:09:55.146
DAY THEY ARE THEY IT PROVIDES

04:09:55.213 --> 04:10:02.354
FOR BRIGHT LINE RULES I AGREE

04:10:02.420 --> 04:10:02.987
THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED YOU TO DO

04:10:03.054 --> 04:10:05.156
IT.

04:10:05.223 --> 04:10:06.858
THAT'S WHY WE ARE.

04:10:06.925 --> 04:10:09.861
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

ANTICIPATED RALLY THESE THREE

04:10:11.996 --> 04:10:13.064
CASES A YEAR.

04:10:13.131 --> 04:10:13.898
IS.

04:10:13.965 --> 04:10:14.733
IS THAT BASED ON WHAT DID YOU

04:10:14.799 --> 04:10:16.000
BASE THAT ON DO YOU THINK THERE

04:10:16.067 --> 04:10:17.502

04:10:32.884 --> 04:10:35.353
ESTIMATE BASED ON HOURS --

04:10:35.420 --> 04:10:36.788
LOOKING BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF

04:10:36.855 --> 04:10:38.356
WHAT THE HOURS THAT WE SPENT ON

04:10:38.423 --> 04:10:39.724
SIMILAR CASES AND FORCING

04:10:39.791 --> 04:10:42.560
STATUTES THAT THIS TYPE OF SCOPE

04:10:42.627 --> 04:10:44.496
AND BREATH.

CONTEMPLATED HERE BECAUSE I KNOW

04:10:55.373 --> 04:10:56.107

04:10:56.174 --> 04:10:57.809
WHAT WE ALL AGREED TO IN THE C.

04:10:57.876 --> 04:11:01.679

DO YOU THINK WILL CAPTURE HERE

04:11:23.535 --> 04:11:24.436
THE BEYOND.

04:11:24.502 --> 04:11:26.204
BREACH AT THERE WERE SOME

04:11:26.271 --> 04:11:27.272
ANECDOTES MENTION ABOUT.

04:11:27.338 --> 04:11:29.441
THAT WELL THERE ARE INSTANCES

04:11:29.507 --> 04:11:30.742
WHERE FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE --

04:11:30.809 --> 04:11:33.144
THERE'S THEIR OPT OUT PROVISIONS

04:11:33.211 --> 04:11:35.113
ARE OFTEN PROVISIONS WHAT IF

04:11:35.180 --> 04:11:37.282
THEY'RE NOT IF THE COMPANIES ARE

04:11:37.348 --> 04:11:39.584
IGNORING THOSE -- THOSE

04:11:39.651 --> 04:11:41.319
REQUIREMENTS FOR SOMEONE OP

04:11:41.386 --> 04:11:43.221
SOUTH NAY STILL CONTINUE TO USER

04:11:43.288 --> 04:11:45.557
INFORMATION OR THE YOU KNOW

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT.

04:11:47.425 --> 04:11:49.861
ASPECTS TO THIS AND WHAT THE THE

04:11:49.928 --> 04:11:51.596
GOAL IS TO PUT THE BREACHES ARE

04:11:51.663 --> 04:11:52.997
ONE THING AND THEY'RE COVERED

04:11:53.064 --> 04:11:54.966
AND AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S

04:11:55.033 --> 04:11:55.166
ANY.

04:11:55.233 --> 04:11:57.635
THAT IT THOSE ARE WHAT THEY ARE

04:11:57.702 --> 04:11:59.204
THE THE QUESTION IS ALL THE

04:11:59.270 --> 04:12:00.505
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NON BRIDGE

04:12:00.572 --> 04:12:03.074

04:12:05.944 --> 04:12:07.445
CONSUMERS ARE ASSURED WHEN THEY

04:12:07.512 --> 04:12:14.285
DO IN FACT OPT OUT THAT THEY ARE

04:12:14.352 --> 04:12:16.387
IN FACT OPTED OUT.

04:12:16.454 --> 04:12:17.121
AND AND THAT THOSE AREN'T

04:12:17.188 --> 04:12:19.557
NECESSARILY EASY THINGS. TO TO

04:12:19.624 --> 04:12:21.159
ASSURE HAND AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO

04:12:21.226 --> 04:12:22.560
RESPECT THE WHEN CONSUMERS

04:12:22.627 --> 04:12:24.796
ACTUALLY DO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS

04:12:24.863 --> 04:12:27.699
THEY HAVE TO BE RESPECTED.

04:12:27.765 --> 04:12:28.299

ALREADY APPROACH THAT'S

04:16:51.295 --> 04:16:53.598
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM

04:16:53.664 --> 04:16:54.365
SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED WHICH IS

04:16:54.432 --> 04:16:55.933
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM --

04:16:56.000 --> 04:16:58.102
SHOULD A G. P. R. STYLE DPA

04:16:58.169 --> 04:16:59.504
APPROACH.

04:16:59.570 --> 04:17:02.039
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M VOTING ON

04:17:02.106 --> 04:17:02.240

04:17:02.306 --> 04:17:05.443
WELL.

04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:07.712
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE VOTING ON IS

04:17:07.779 --> 04:17:09.347
THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU WITH

04:17:09.413 --> 04:17:10.948
A COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL

04:17:11.015 --> 04:17:12.717
CONTINUE TRYING TO WORK TO

04:17:12.784 --> 04:17:13.818
CREATE.

04:17:13.885 --> 04:17:16.354
AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT IS

04:17:16.420 --> 04:17:17.955
GOING.

04:17:18.022 --> 04:17:19.957
TO MEET THE THE EXPECTATIONS ON

04:17:20.024 --> 04:17:22.560
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL.

04:17:22.627 --> 04:17:23.494
AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

04:17:23.561 --> 04:17:24.328
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GAIN

04:17:24.395 --> 04:17:26.631
THE SUPPORT OF AT LEAST TWENTY

04:17:26.697 --> 04:17:28.733
ONE PEOPLE ON THE SENATE SIDE.

04:17:28.800 --> 04:17:30.668
AND AT LEAST FORTY ONE PEOPLE AS

04:17:30.735 --> 04:17:31.836
IT GOES THROUGH WHATEVER

04:17:31.903 --> 04:17:33.738
ITERATIONS IT WILL GO THROUGH IN

04:17:33.805 --> 04:17:35.840
THE ASSEMBLY SIDE WE HAVE TO

04:17:35.907 --> 04:17:37.708
KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING WE

04:17:37.775 --> 04:17:39.510
NOW HAVE SOMETHING THAT THE

04:17:39.577 --> 04:17:40.144
EIGHT WITH THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO

04:17:40.211 --> 04:17:41.712
THE AG THE AG SAYS IT ISN'T

04:17:41.779 --> 04:17:43.881
WORKABLE. FOR FOR HIM TO DO ALL

04:17:43.948 --> 04:17:45.850
THESE VARIOUS THINGS BUT THE AGE

04:17:45.917 --> 04:17:47.819
SHE IS ALSO WILLING TO LOOK AT

04:17:47.885 --> 04:17:49.520
OTHER OPTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT

04:17:49.587 --> 04:17:51.022
WE'RE GONNA DO THAT'S THAT'S A

04:17:51.088 --> 04:17:52.290
COMMITMENT I MAKE.

04:17:52.356 --> 04:17:53.558
AND I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

04:17:53.624 --> 04:17:55.860
IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE THIS

04:17:55.927 --> 04:17:57.161
FORWARD SO THAT WE END UP.

04:17:57.228 --> 04:17:59.564
MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OF 94%

04:17:59.630 --> 04:18:02.767
OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WANT THEIR

04:18:02.834 --> 04:18:05.002
PRIVACY RIGHTS PROTECTED.

04:18:05.069 --> 04:18:08.806
AND AND WITH THAT I WOULD TO SO

04:18:08.873 --> 04:18:09.440
I THINK THE START CENTER STERN.

04:18:09.507 --> 04:18:10.374
YEAH THAT WAS JUST THE ONE LAST

04:18:10.441 --> 04:18:11.876
POINT IS I'M WITH THAT 94% I

04:18:11.943 --> 04:18:14.679
THINK THE DISCUSSION IS HOW BEST

04:18:14.745 --> 04:18:15.179
TO DO IT.

04:18:15.246 --> 04:18:15.880
AND AND THE THING THAT WOULD

04:18:15.947 --> 04:18:16.981
MAKE ME A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE

04:18:17.048 --> 04:18:18.549
TAKING A VOTE IS TO HEAR FROM

04:18:18.616 --> 04:18:20.918
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHAT WHICH

04:18:20.985 --> 04:18:22.553
APPROACH IT IS.

04:18:22.620 --> 04:18:25.456
HE WANTS TO PURSUE IF IT SEEMS

04:18:25.523 --> 04:18:28.392
LIKE THIS IS THE POSITION OF HIM

04:18:28.459 --> 04:18:30.494

THAT WE'RE GOING.

04:18:31.696 --> 04:18:33.598

THANK YOU AND I JUST HAVE A

04:21:31.642 --> 04:21:33.210
QUESTION.

04:21:33.277 --> 04:21:36.280
YEAH AS DRAFTED.

04:21:36.347 --> 04:21:38.449
THE BILL REQUIRES A CONSUMER TO

04:21:38.516 --> 04:21:40.918
OPT IN. TO RECEIVE CERTAIN

04:21:40.985 --> 04:21:42.253
PROTECTIONS.

04:21:42.319 --> 04:21:45.956
IF THAT CONSUMER IS DAMAGED.

04:21:46.023 --> 04:21:47.725
IN HIS NOT OPTED IN TO BE

04:21:47.792 --> 04:21:49.293
PROTECTED.

04:21:49.360 --> 04:21:54.065
DO THEY HAVE ANY REMEDY.

04:21:54.131 --> 04:21:55.666
SO WE TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

04:21:55.733 --> 04:21:56.934
DIFFERENTLY WE DON'T WE DON'T

04:21:57.001 --> 04:21:59.336
THEY OFTEN WITH A REQUEST TO OPT

04:21:59.403 --> 04:22:00.337
OUT AND AND IT'S IT'S A LITTLE

04:22:00.404 --> 04:22:00.671
BIT.

04:22:00.738 --> 04:22:03.474
THUNDERBOLT BUT AT THIS POINT

04:22:03.541 --> 04:22:05.076
THE CONSUMER COULD NOT.

04:22:05.142 --> 04:22:07.711
BRING A PRIVATE ACTION UNLESS

04:22:07.778 --> 04:22:09.513
THERE IS A INVOLVING A BREACH OF

04:22:09.580 --> 04:22:10.581

04:22:10.648 --> 04:22:12.450
SPECIFICALLY TIED TO CERTAIN

04:22:12.516 --> 04:22:13.651

04:22:13.717 --> 04:22:15.853
AND THAT THE THE CONSUMER WOULD

04:22:15.920 --> 04:22:18.856
HAVE TO SHOW -- THAT THAT BREACH

04:22:18.923 --> 04:22:21.392
WITHIN DUE TO NEGLIGENCE.

04:22:21.459 --> 04:22:22.393
THE MECHANISM FOR ENFORCEMENT

04:22:22.460 --> 04:22:25.729
WOULD BE ALTERNATIVELY IF THE AG

04:22:25.796 --> 04:22:28.032
WERE LOOKING AT THE COMPANY TO

04:22:28.099 --> 04:22:29.066
SEE IF THEY HAVE VIOLATED THE

04:22:29.133 --> 04:22:31.735
LAW AND SO IN THAT RESPECT.

04:22:31.802 --> 04:22:33.237
THE WOULD NOT HAVE TO SHOW

04:22:34.638 --> 04:22:35.506
HARM.

04:22:35.573 --> 04:22:37.975
SO THE CONSUMER ONLY HAS REDRESS

04:22:38.042 --> 04:22:40.744
WITH RELATION TO PREACH IN A

04:22:40.811 --> 04:22:43.447

FOR ADULTS AND THEN FOR CHILDREN

04:23:09.340 --> 04:23:10.508
BUT COMPANIES ARE PROHIBITED

04:23:10.574 --> 04:23:12.209
FROM A CLASS SELLING INFORMATION

04:23:12.276 --> 04:23:13.577

THE CONSUMER HAS TO TAKE AN

04:23:24.955 --> 04:23:26.690
AFFIRMATIVE STEP TO OPT OUT

04:23:32.129 --> 04:23:33.898
HONORED BY COMPANIES THAT IS

04:23:33.964 --> 04:23:38.536
DIFFERENT THAN THE EUROPEAN

04:23:38.602 --> 04:23:40.671

MOVE FORWARD IN A SUSTAINABLE

04:24:31.021 --> 04:24:33.958
WAY -- I THINK THERE ARE FAR TOO

04:24:34.024 --> 04:24:35.960
MANY UNCERTAINTIES THEY'RE FAR

04:24:36.026 --> 04:24:38.429
TOO MANY FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES

04:24:38.495 --> 04:24:40.097
THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL

04:24:40.164 --> 04:24:41.865
LEGISLATIVE.

04:24:41.932 --> 04:24:44.935
EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS -- I WOULD --
