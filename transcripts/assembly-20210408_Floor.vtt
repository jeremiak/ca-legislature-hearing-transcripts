ALL OF YOU KNOW IT'S SAYING A

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:50.947
LOT. AND SHE WAS ONE OF THE

00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:52.115
MOST LOVING PEOPLE I EVER KNEW

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:57.220
IT. AND I'M STANDING HERE TODAY

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:59.189
BECAUSE ON NOVEMBER NINTH

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:00.791

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:15.005
OFFER AND THEY WENT THAT

00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:15.572
EVENING DRESSED UP AND THEY

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:16.873
WENT TO THE OPERA. AND SO THEY

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.476
WERE ROUNDED UP. AND THEY FOUND

00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:22.179

00:51:30.387 --> 00:51:32.689
MEANS TO FIND A WAY OUT. THE

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.959
NEW SOMEONE OCEANS AWAY THAT

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:38.161
WOULD SPONSOR OUR FAMILY. AND

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:39.996
MUCH IS MADE OF SCHINDLER AND

00:51:40.063 --> 00:51:41.998
THE OTHERS WHO DID SO MUCH WITH

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:44.568
SUCH BRAVERY. TO SAVE LIVES

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:46.770
DURING THE HOLOCAUST BUT I

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:47.370
THINK WE ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:49.806
THE PEOPLE. WHO LIVES OUTSIDE

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:52.542
THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS WHO

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.678
WOULD BE SHOWERED IN THE ASH OF

00:51:54.744 --> 00:51:56.446
THOSE THAT WERE BEING BURNED IN

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:57.080
THE EVENTS IN THEIR OWN

00:51:57.147 --> 00:52:02.385
NEIGHBORHOODS THEY DID NOTHING.

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.354
AND WE HAVE A CHOICE EVERY TIME

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:07.557
HEAT RISES UP. TO BE THE OSKAR

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:10.093
SCHINDLER'S. OR TO BE THE

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.329
PEOPLE WHO ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:13.763
SWING ON SWINGS THAT'S COVERED

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:16.132
IN ASH OF THE LIVES OF THOSE

00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:19.269
WHO ARE BEING BURNED. AND WE

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:20.971
HAVE STEPPED UP MEMBERS TO BE

00:52:21.037 --> 00:52:22.906
LEADERS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:25.041
OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. AND

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.343
WE MUST REMEMBER OUR SOLEMN

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:28.712
OBLIGATION THE OBLIGATION THAT

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:29.679
ARE CALLING FROM SANTA MONICA

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.748
JUST SPOKE ABOUT. TO STAND UP

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:33.617
TO HATE IN ALL OF ITS FORMS.

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:35.552
BECAUSE THE HOLOCAUST DIDN'T

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:36.152
START WITH PEOPLE BEING BURNED

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.921
IN OVENS. THAT WAS ITS

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.990
CULMINATION. IT STARTED WITH

00:52:40.056 --> 00:52:44.594
PROPAGANDA IN HEATS. AND MY

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:45.629
GRANDMOTHER BEING KICKED OUT OF

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:47.030
SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WAS NO

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:49.599
LONGER WORTHY TO BE EDUCATED.

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:51.167
AND THEN IT ENDED IN THE LIVES

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:52.602
LOST THAT WE SPEAK ABOUT TODAY

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:54.804
YOU SEE SITTING ON YOUR DESKS.

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:57.207
AND SO WE MUST STAND UP AT THAT

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.409
FIRST MOMENT WHEN WE HEAR

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:01.945
PROPAGANDA TO SAY NO WE KNOW

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.980
WHERE THIS CAN LEAD. AND IT

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:07.150
JUST RECENT YEARS WE SON ****

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:07.684
MARCHING IN THE STREETS OF

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:10.887
AMERICA. MY GRANDMOTHER WAS

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:14.925
ALIVE TO SEE THAT. WE MUST BE

00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:17.627
OF THE FORCE THAT STOPS THAT.

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:20.797
AND SO WE SPOKE RECENTLY ABOUT

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:21.598
THE ANTI ASIAN HATE THAT IS ON

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:24.768
A RISE WE TALK ABOUT THE ANTI

00:53:24.834 --> 00:53:26.870
SEMITISM THE CONTINUES TO RISE

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:28.338
AND I AM FOR EACH AND EVERYONE

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.640
OF YOU TO USE TODAY TO REMEMBER

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:33.076
OUR OBLIGATION TO STOP IT TO

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.511
SPEAK OUT AND TO NEVER BE

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:36.713
SILENT SO THIS. NEVER HAPPENS

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.183
AGAIN. SO ONE'S LIFE DOESN'T

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.784

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.752

MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH SONQOR

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:51.640
COMMANDO AT AUSCHWITZ USED TO

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:53.676

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.005
SOMETHING TO ALWAYS REMEMBER.

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:23.839
THEY WERE THE DAUGHTERS OF

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:24.974
