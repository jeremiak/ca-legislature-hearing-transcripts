MR ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WE'RE ANXIOUSLY LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION THEY CAN SHARE. MEMBERS WE'VE BEEN. THROUGH PROBABLY EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE IN ONE WAY SHAPE OR FORM- HIT BY THE WILDFIRE DISASTERS- AND SURPRISE THE WORK IS NOT DONE EVEN THOUGH WE WRAPPED UP LAST SESSION AFTER A FEW FLURRY OF WORK. WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES A DEFENSIBLE SPACE RIGHT AROUND THE HOME% ZERO TO FIVE FEET THAT SEEM LIKE NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL COMPARED TO THE MAGNITUDE OF. FORCE THAT NEED TO BE- A WILD LANDS ARE SORT OF INTIMIDATING LEE LARGE LANDSCAPES WHEN YOU GO DOWN TO THE SMALL WHICH IS JUST. RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR ALL ALONG YOUR HOUSE. BOB YOUR GARAGE ON THE VENTS OF YOUR WINDOWS. THOSE ARE THE LIFE AND DEATH MAKE OR BREAK PLACES THAT. TRULY FROM A FIRE SIZE PERSPECTIVE. WILL MAKE US RESILIENT- IN ADDITION TO ALL THE NATURAL AND MANAGEMENT WE NEED TO DO IS A THIS BILL. IS TRYING TO. PULL OUT A PIECE OF A OF LEGISLATION THAT IT WORKED ON LAST YEAR DILIGENTLY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AS PART OF A BIGGER PACKAGE THAT WAS VETOED- YOU FEEL THOUGH THAT. THE MINIMUM. THE COMPONENT SEVEN THIRTY NINE ARE SORT OF NO BRAINER AS WE GET THAT MAY THERE MAY BE SOME CONTROVERSY ALTHOUGH I STILL THINK. THAT WAS A VERY SOLID WELL THOUGHT THROUGH MEASURE BUT- THERE'S SOME SENSITIVITIES AROUND. ENFORCEMENT OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE- AND EXACTLY HOW YOU FINANCE SOME OF THIS IN THE IMPACT AS AN INSURANCE MARKETS SO WHAT WE KNEW WHAT WE DO TO. PEOPLE THIS IS A MAJOR OWN CAN DO AND IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS THE RIGHT DATE ON IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY ARE COUNTIES ARE FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE THE RIGHT DATA ON. IT TAKES EYES AND EARS FIGURE OUT- PEOPLE GASKET THEIR FENCE OR THEIR GARAGE OR DONE SWEPT UP THE LEAVES UNDER THE EAVES EASIER. MAYBE WE GET TO AN AERO. SOMEHOW ALL BE EXACTLY OR- ECOLOGICALLY SOMEHOW SENSED BUT RIGHT NOW IS GONNA BE A PEOPLE PEOPLE POWER ISSUE AND SO THIS BILL IS RELEASE. WAS TO GIVE A CONDUIT TO WAKE UP COMMUNITIES TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. AND THIS IS IN- I DON'T I DON'T THINK THIS IS POLITICAL OR EVEN IF YOU'RE PASSED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT OR IF YOU IF YOU THAT DOESN'T REALLY WAKE YOU UP IN THE MORNING- IF YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF YOUR COMMUNITY I THINK I TOOK ME LIKE. CHATSWORTH IN YOU KNOW THE- THE VETERANS THE SENIORS ARE OUT THERE DOING NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH. RIGHT THERE MAKING SURE THERE'S I'M ON THE STREETS AND THAT'S WITH FOCUS ON THEY'LL THINK M. AS AN OPERA ABOUT. CHANGE BUT THEY ARE WORRIED. THEIR NEIGHBORS HOUSES IN DOWN JUST A RICH FIRE. WE CAN ONLY DO SO ENGAGEMENT THROUGH THE KIND OF TRAINING IS CONSERVE THIS BILL MAY WE CAN ACTUALLY START TO- GET COMMUNITIES DOING THE HARD WORK ON THE GROUND OF WORKING WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS TO MAKE SURE THEIR HOUSES ARE SAFE AND THEIR NEIGHBORS NEIGHBORS HOUSE ARE SAFE BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS BROUGHT TOGETHER IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU JUST. FOR YOUR HOME NOT ENOUGH YOUR NEW HOME AS WE ARE IN TWO AND YOUR- THAT IS YOUR ALL IN IT TOGETHER SO I DON'T WANT TO OVER HYPE THE BILL AND SAY THIS IS A SOME SORT OF FIX TO CIVIC LETHARGY THAT WE ARE. OUR SYSTEM BUT I DO THINK. SOME SO I'M HAPPY AGAIN TECH DETAILS BUT THAT'S THE BILL AND I'VE MUCH SMARTER- TECHNICALLY TRAINED FOLKS AND I ARE HERE TO SUPPORT US WE WIDE WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS PORT BUT THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS HERE AND THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AS WELL- TO GIVE A SORT OF SNAPSHOT OF. A WHY THIS BILL SO THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE. THANK YOU. AT MY NAME IS KAREN BERGER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS. AND WE'RE HERE A REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SB SEVEN THREE NINE WE FEEL LIKE IT WILL HELP CALIFORNIA IN OR IN THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY ALREADY DO A TO HELP COMMUNITIES AND LANDOWNERS. BE FIRE SAFE IN BOTH HAVING THE TOOLS AND INFORMATION THEY NEED- THE NINETY FIVE ARE CITIES IN THE STATE- HAVE BEEN PARTNERING WITH CAL FIRE FOR DECADES TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK. AND AS THE FOLKS THAT SAID AT THE INTERSECTION AGRICULTURE CONST AND OUR COMMUNITIES. EVERY DAY WE'RE HEARING FROM LANDOWNERS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THIS IS A REALLY PRESSING ISSUE FOR THEM. THAT'S WHY WE THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY THE OUR CITIES HAVE TAKEN ON THIS WORK FOR THE- LAST ADD. YOU KNOW. DECADES ONE REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING IS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY- WHERE THE OUR CITY IS WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH A FIRE SAFE OR THE FIRE LOCAL FIRE AGENCY IS THAT WHEN THEY DO GO OUT AND DO INSPECTIONS- THEY HAND OVER THE INFORMATION FOR IT OUR CD AND OUR CD THEN GOES OUT AND WORKS THAT LANDOWNER TO FIND GRANTS TO SECURE RESOURCES AND TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE LANDOWNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY ABLE TO IMPLEMENT BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A CORRECT WAY. IT'S IMPORTANT PARTNER. WE BUT A- STATEWIDE EFFORT TO STANDARDIZE THIS HOME HARDENING INDEFENSIBLE SPACE. WILL REALLY HELP US IN BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR LANDOWNERS. AND WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO HELP CAL FIRE IN ADVANCING THE GOALS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN WORKING SO HARD ON. SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ON BOB RAN CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I IN A BEEN WORKING WITH BUILDING CODES FOR CLOSE TO FOUR DECADES NOW. NORMALLY TAKES A COUPLE OF DECADES TO ACQUIRE PHIL DATA SHOW THAT A CERTAIN SET OF BUILDING STANDARDS REACHING THE GOALS THAT- BUT WE'RE DESIRED WHEN THEY WERE FIRST DVELOPED AND ADOPTED THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH THE WILDLAND URBAN FIRE SAFETY RAKES WITHIN JUST A COUPLE YEARS. OF THEIR MPLEMENTATION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- WE HAD GOOD SHOWING THAT A WORDS ARE MORE IMPORTANTLY THE COMBINATION OF WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE BUILDING STANDARDS EIGHT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION SENSIBLE SPACE IS BASIC. BOX ALL WAITED TO FIGHT THIS AND WE NEED BOOTS ON THE GROUND. AND THIS BILL GETS UP MOVING FORWARD A KEY PART HERE IS A EELOPING TRAINING WE NEED THAT FROM SAN DIEGO TO YUBA CITY TO EUREKA- AND THAT'S HOW WE HANDLE BUILDING CODES AND SO INDUSTRY IS READY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS. AND ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE THANK YOU. THE WITNESSES. IF YOU CAN STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION PLEASE. DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. IN MANY NIKOLINA NONE IS A SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IS IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS FROM THE DIET SENATOR BOARD JUST. AJ WANTED THANK A CENTER STERN ON THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I THINK A- WE HAVE ALL COMPOSITE OF DIFFERENT BILLS THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND FIRE PREPAREDNESS STUFF LIKE THAT. I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT A FORMER LIFE THE AREA THAT ABUTTED THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER A LOT OF HOMES AROUND THERE AND I CREATED SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE. PROTOCOLS ARE NOT ONLY FOR THE PRIVATE- HOMEOWNER BUT ALSO GUIDANCE ON PUBLIC LANDS. AND I'M WONDERING DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON TO DO. TO PRIVATE LAND. GIVE A THOUGHT ON THE GLANDS THAT ABOUT THIS AREA IN MAYBE DO NOT ALLOW FOR THAT FULL I GUESS HUNDRED FEET. DEFENSIBLE SPACE. WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS BE APPLICABLE TO PUBLICLY. I THINK THROUGH THE INSPECTION PROCESS YOU PROBABLY START TO GET TO THE TENSION POINTS IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY SO YEAH THE PRIVATE LANDOWNER GOES DOWN THE HILLSIDE CUTS OFTEN THAT IT FILTERS INTO PARKER BLM OR CONSERVANCY RIGHT. IN THEORY I THINK YOU'D YOU'D SIR X. ALL THOSE ARE ATTENTION POINTS. THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT THE MONEY PART OF IT- BUT THE FACT IS THAT WHAT WOULD. HE INJURED ABILITY TO REALLY GO AFTER THE PUBLIC LAND SIDE AS THE IN M. BUDGET. FOR A PARKS CONSERVANCY I THINK WE CAN GET THROUGH THE RIGHT WHATEVER REGULATORY ANXIETY THERE MIGHT BE SAY LIKE ME WHEN WE WERE IN MALIBU YOU HAVE SOME ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE HABITAT THAT WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRYING TO PREVENT A MUD SLIDE AND YOU NEED TO PUT QUE RAILS AND- DEPARTMENT. IF YOU IF YOU'RE TALKING LIKE LIFE AND DEATH. FOR THAT KIND OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE A MAINTENANCE BUT- WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE THE RESOURCE QUESTION I THINK AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE GO FIND IT SO I GUESS THIS IS THE GO FIND IT PART. I'M NOT PROMISING THAT. CHALLENGE BUT I DO THINK WE'LL FOR WILL FIND THOSE SPOTS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA JUST HAFTA WERE THROWN SO I APPRECIATE BRING THAT UP AND NEVER APPROPRIATE AND I'D CERTAINLY MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS FORWARD- IF THERE IS AN- FEDERATION WHERE THAT'S CALLED. A CONTEMPLATED. I THINK THERE NEED BE SOME CAN. OF THE CROSSOVER TERRITORY- BUT AS A FIRST STEP FANTASTIC THANK YOU CENTER WHICH WAS ON THIS POINT I'VE GOT TWO OTHER SPEAKERS AT WHAT ON THAT QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY REGARDING THE ANSWER THE BILL SAYS THE. THE TRAINING PROGRAM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE INDIVIDUALS TO CONDUCT DEFENSIBLE STATE ASSESSMENTS IN STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. SO IT'S NOT JUST ON PRIVATE PROPERTY IS THAT CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT INTERJECTION. I THINK OBVIOUSLY TO EMPOWER PEOPLE IS VERY IMPORTANT DURING THESE FEEL HELPLESS WHEN A FIRE COMES OR WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO ANTICIPATE FIRE SEASON SO I DO APPRECIATE THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO. REITERATE THE OBSERVATION BY THE ANALYSES THAT. IT'S I THINK THE KEY TO THIS IS MAKING SURE THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT IS ULTIMATELY DEVELOPED IS ONE THAT DOESN'T GIVE PEOPLE SOME FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. AND GIVE THEM FALSE BUT THEY EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING. AND TO IN THIS THOSE VIEWS ON WHAT. IS AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT SHOWS GIVES PEOPLE ARE THE INFORMATION IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HELPFUL AND SO I THINK THERE'S OF THERE'S A FINE LINE TO THAT- BUT I DO THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE KNOW. WHAT STEPS ARE AVAILABLE I KNOW HAVING GONE THROUGH THE FIRES IN MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A NUMBER IN YOURS WE'VE ALL I THINK PROBABLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE EXPERIENCE THESE- THAT THE- HAVING INFORMATION AND BEING EMPOWERED TO ACT. IS VERY VERY CRITICAL TO GET THROUGH THESE. DISASTERS AND ALSO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR HOMES AND OUR FAMILIES WHICH IS REALLY. THE ALMOST EXCLUSIVE CONSIDERATION WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS SO I WOULD CHOOSE- LIKE TO REITERATE. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ADDITIONAL KILEY GUIDANCE AND TIMELINESS FOR THE SAD PARTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CLEAR METRICS AND WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO EDUCATE PEOPLE TO KNOW AND TO. AND TO BE ABLE TO DO- AND TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT BACK SO WE FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING. THAT I WOULD HAVE MOVED BILL IF IT. AND EVER REALLY MOTIONS HEY. THESE TAKE NOTE WE'VE MOVED A BILL TO GET. IT IS A KNOWS THEIR FIRST AND IS A NOTE- YEAH YEAH I GUESS I HAVE A TWO PARTS TO IT AND- AND I'M I'M REALLY FOLLOWS UPON SOMETHING THAT SENATOR JACKSON'S TALKING ABOUT- AND THERE'S IT'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT SME RESOURCES TO. HELPING PEOPLE FIGURE OUT HOW TO HARDEN. AROUND THEIR HOMES BUT. BUT IN DOING THAT THE QUESTION BECOMES. WHAT HAPPENS ONCE. THE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING AROUND IN YOUR TALKING TO PEOPLE I AM ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE COLLECTING INFORMATION ON HERE'SWHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO HARDEN YOUR HOME WHO GETS THAT INFORMATION IS AT THE LOCAL COUNTY THAT GETS IT IS IT A STATE. AGENCY THEY GET THAT. ARE WE GONNA AT AND THIS MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF ANOTHER BAYLOR GONNA HAVE- GRANTS FOR HOMEOWNERS. SO THAT THEY CAN COME IN AND SOME OF IT IS VEGETATION BUT SOME OF IT IS THE- IS ARE THE VENTS AND THE THINGS THAT WILL COST HOMEOWNERS MONEY. YEAH AND- AND THEN ARE THERE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS IN OTHER WORDS YOU BETTER DO IT OR ELSE AND WHO WILL WHO IS WHO'S DOING THE ARE OR ELSE. AND ARE THEY GET IN A PERIOD OF TIME IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND THEN PART OF THAT I THINK I WOULD THINK. PART OF THE ANALYSIS HAS TO BE. LOOKING FOR AND ENFORCEMENT AND I'M LOOKING FOR. WE JUST ALL IT CLICK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE SITTING UP AT. YOU KNOW UPON YOUR ON THE- GO OUT. I LEARNED NOT. TO ME. BETTER SOMETHING UP AND TO WHO IS LOOKING AT LANDSCAPING BECAUSE I WAS. WE HAVE. THIS INTERFACE IN MANY COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE. AB. FOLIAGE THAT IS NOT NATIVE TO CALIFORNIA THAT WE'VE PLANTED THAT. THAT IT CAN BE- IS VERY FIRE PRONE I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT- PALM TREES LIKE UP LIKE ROMAN CANDLES WHO KNEW RIGHT BUT IT'S LIKE HELLO IT'S FULL OF OIL AND SO. AND EUCALYPTUS IS BUT WE THEM LINING MANY STREETS AT PARTICULARLY AS YOU COME DOWN OUT OF THE FOOT HILLS AND SO- IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO BE SMARTER ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING THINGS BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A NEW NORMAL AND WITHOUT AT. IT WE ALSO OUGHT TO HAVE LANDSCAPING AND ADVICE IN TERMS OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE DANGEROUS TO HAVE CLOSE TO YOUR HOME AND I A- I AM A VIDEO. AIR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAPPEN TO BE CLOSE TO WHERE MY FOLKS WHERE AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND- THE CAMERA WAS JUST LOOKING UP THE HILLS AND A ROMAN CANDLE IN THE PICTURE LET UP THERE WAS NOTHING CLOSE TO IT IT JUST LET AT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT BIRDS ARE FLYING. AND IT WAS A SHOCK TO ME BECAUSE LINE OF MY FOR MY PARENTS HOUSE SO I MEAN WE'RE GONNA SING WAS HE WAS YOU TAKE AN AMBER JUMPING THE ONE O. ONE FREE WAY. IT THAT'S A YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW TAKING A FIVE HUNDRED FOOT JUMP BINGO HALF MILE JONES RIGHT I MEAN SO IT'S NOT LIKE A THE FIRE ITSELF IS BURNING PERHAPS. IS THAT WHAT IT SLIPS THROUGH HITS THAT ONE IGNITION POINT. I KNOW ARAMBULA DIRECT RESPONSE TO THAT AND BOTH THE STAFF ANALYSIS IN THE OPENING COMES TO SENATOR MADE. UP AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN INDEED GOT GOT VETOED- IT WAS PROPOSING TO DO- FOUR FIVE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS ALL OF WHICH WE SUPPORTED- BUT THIS BILL. THAT IS SORT OF TAKING ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS ARE IS LOOKING AT THE- MOMENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM CERTAIN ONLY. I WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND GUARDS TO WEAR THIS GETS APPLIED YES IT'S TAILORED FOR SRBS- BUT IN THE BUILDING CODE WORLD ONE SH. THAT DONE THE WORK'S DONE AND WE CAN EXPAND TO JUST ANYTHING. AND SO. THE POINT IS A GETS THAT FRAMEWORK IN RIGHT. THAT WE GET IN A PIGGY BACK ON TOP FROM ELSEWHERE AND THAT'S THE KEY POINT ONCE YOU GET THE- AND TO TACK ON A THAT GOES TO IF THERE IF YOU'RE NOT COMPLIANCE. YOUR FIRE DEPARTMENT SO AND JUST A MACINNES INS FOR FIRE DEPARTMENT WITH- COMPETING LEVELS I WOULD SAY OF COMPLIANCE ONCE THEY COME IN TACK THAT THAT NOTICE TO YOUR DOOR OR TO YOUR GATE I WOULD SAY IN VENTURA COUNTY WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT JUST. A HOP TO. HE WON COUNTY OVER YOU KNOW IT GETS MORE COMPLICATED BUT I. AT LEAST THAT DATA WILL GO BACK TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND SAVE THEM SOME TIME AND MONEY SO THEY GO. TO PINPOINT THOSE HOUSES.
