THIS IS ON ITEM NUMBER ONE SP FOUR THREE FIVE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT THE SENATE BILL FOUR THIRTY FIVE WHICH WILL CREATE A FIRST IN THE NATION LAW TO EMPOWER VICTIMS OF DIGITAL TRAFFICKING TO BRING CIVIL ACTION AGAINST. ANY PERSON OR ONLINE PLATFORM TO DISTRIBUTE CERTAIN SEXUAL MATERIAL THEM WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND I SHOULD ADD THE BILL IDENTIFIES- THE VERY SPECIFIC PRESCRIBED- THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT'S NOT CONSENSUAL THIS BILL STEMS FROM A TRAGEDY. THAT TOOK PLACE IN MY DISTRICT. BUT WERE TEENAGER TOOK HER OWN LIFE AFTER HER ASSAILANTS DISTRIBUTED PHOTOS OF HER SEXUAL ASSAULT. ADDITIONALLY THE TRAFFICKING OF DIGITAL SEXUAL MATERIAL HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY PERVASIVE NIGHT NATIONWIDE. CONTENT THAT IS UPLOADED TO THE INTERNET EACH DAY INCLUDES RAPE CHILD RAPE REVENGE **** AND OTHER FORMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN TWENTY TWENTY SIXTY NINE MILLION ONLINE VIDEOS AND OTHER CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL WAS REPORTED TO FEDERAL AUTHORITIES THE COURSE AS JUST WHAT WAS REPORTED. IN OPINION COLUMNIST FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES RECENTLY PROFILED VICTIMS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE. WHO ARE MONETIZED AND EXPLOITED THROUGH WEBSITES THAT ALLOW THIS MATERIAL GENERATED ADVERTISING IMPRESSIONS FROM IT. WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT OF WITHOUT GUARDING CONSENT WITHOUT ANY CONSENT ONCE THIS CONTENT IS UPLOADED TO AN ONLINE PLATFORM IT CAN BE DOWNLOADED BY THE USERS OF COURSE. AND EVEN IF THE PERFORMER REMOVE SOME MATERIAL ANYONE WHO PREVIOUSLY DONE ALL OF THE MATERIAL CAN SIMPLY RE UPLOAD IT. LEADING TO THE DIGITAL TRAFFICKING OF THE MATERIAL- ON THE NET SO AGAIN REPEAT TRAFFICKING ONE MIGHT SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN- WHICH IS A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM UNDER SB FOUR THIRTY FIVE. IF THE MATERIAL IN WHICH THE VICTIM IS DEPICTED HAS NOT CEASED DISTRIBUTION. WITH TWO BUSINESS DAYS- TWO BUSINESS DAYS AFTER LEGAL NOTIFICATION AS DESCRIBED IN THE BILL. THE VICTIM CAN SEEK DAMAGES OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THE SMALL DOUBLES TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF VICTIM IS A MINOR. THE BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW A PARENT OR GUARDIAN OF A MINOR TO BRING ACTION ON THEIR BEHALF. IN THE LAW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TAKE ACTION- BUT ONLY IN THE CASE OF REPEAT OFFENDERS. SP FOUR THIRTY FIVE ALSO PROVIDES INSTANCES OF NO LIABILITY FOR THE DISTRIBUTOR UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. INCLUDING IF THE IMAGE WAS CREATED. IN AGREEMENT. THAT IT IS FOR PUBLIC USE OR DISTRIBUTION. TWO IF THE PERSON POSSESSING THE IMAGE HAS PERMISSION TO PUBLISH IT. FROM THE PERSON IN THE IMAGE. THREE OF THE PERSON THE IMAGE HAS NO REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. OUR LAWS NEED TO BE UPDATED TO INCLUDE PENALTIES THAT MATCH THE TIMELINE AND FINANCIAL SKILL. BUT THE REALITIES OF THE DIGITAL AGE. ALTHOUGH AMENDMENTS ARE NOT IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. I COMMIT TO MAKING THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE BILL. A NUMBER ONE AND THERE WHAT TYPE OF CONDUCT THE BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. NAMELY LIMITING THE BILL TO DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIONABLE MATERIAL- THE WORD OBTAIN FOR EXAMPLE- WILL BE STRICKEN TO ADDRESS FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS INCLUDING THROUGH CAL THROUGH CLEAR COURT TESTED DEFINITIONS AND NECESSARY. EXCEPTIONS. THREE ZERO THE APPLICATION TO BUILD A CERTAIN PARTIES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUTSTANDING SECTION TWO THIRTY CONFLICTS IN FOR CLARIFY THE ONLY VICTIM OR THE GUARDIAN IF THERE ARE MINOR CAN BRING A CIVIL ACTION NOT ANY PERSON IN APPRECIATE US SO MY COLLEAGUES ASSISTING- THEY'RE LETTING US KNOW OF WHERE THOSE AMENDMENTS NEED TO BE A PARTICULARLY THE LAST ONE- I VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE HELP OF COMMITTEE STAFF IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE- OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEAR. AND NOT ONLY TO WORK THROUGH POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT I SUGGESTED TODAY- BUT ALSO- IT TO HELP US JUST GENERALLY NARROW THE BUILD TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE LAW THAT THAT WILL WORK PROPERLY IN THE REAL WORLD I'D LIKE TO THINK- OF THE IN ADDITION- THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S LAW CENTER THE AUDREY POP FOUNDATION. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH VOTER PROJECT EQUALITY NOW IN MANY MANY MORE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED THE BILL TO DATE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ISSUE APART WITH THE AUDREY POTTSTOWN DACIAN LET ME SEE I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS POTTER YOU US. YES MA'AM ALL RIGHTS OF CLOSURES COMPOUNDER V. AUDREY POT FOUNDATION AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BECOME PART OF IT WELL. MY DAUGHTER AUDREY CAUGHT WITH A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON SOUTH PARK THERE TONIGHT WELL. SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS SHE RESTRICTED HER CLOTHES AND PHOTOGRAPHED NAKED. WITHOUT A LANGUAGE WRITTEN ON HER BODY. ELECTRONIC IMAGES WERE SHARED ON CAMPUS AND AMONG HER PEERS. THE AFTERMATH OF THE FACT OF THE ASSAULT INCLUDED BULLYING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND BY A TEXT AND FOUND THE OFFENDERS TRIED TO COVER UP HE CRIME. MY DAUGHTER FOUND HER REPUTATION WAS RUINED AND IN HER OWN WORDS THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS. UNDERSECRETARY FOR JUST EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE ASSAULT. BREACH OF PRIVACY CAN BE DEVASTATING TO SOMEONE WHO FEEL THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE FURTHER DISTRIBUTION OF THE IMAGE THAT. THE CURRENT CIVIL ACTIONS AVAILABLE DON'T OFFER ANY TIMELY REMEDIES TO VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES. BILL WOULD ALLOW THOSE MEDIA PLATFORMS TO REMOVE THESE IMAGES IN A TIMELY MANNER CAN MITIGATE THE DAMAGE TO VICTIMS. I FURTHER FEEL THAT IT COULD DISCOURAGE THE SHARING OF PHOTOS THAT WERE POSTED IN A MOMENT OF ANGER OR HATE. IT IS OFTEN JUVENILES THAT MAKE THESE MISTAKES THAT CREATE LIFELONG DAMAGE TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS WE COULD CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR REMOVAL AND POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES. I SUPPORT THIS BILL IN THE INTEREST OF PRESERVING PRIVATELY AND SAVING YOUNG LIVES LIKE MY DAUGHTERS. I HOPE YOU WILL AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BEFORE WE- HAVE THE NEXT- PERSON TESTIFY I NEED TO ANNOUNCE THAT DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MEANS TO TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME ALLOW TO PRIMARY WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ALLOWED TO PRIMARY WITNESSES SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL EACH PRIMARY WITNESS WILL BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK FOR.

APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE- UNFORTUNATE THIS TIME WE'RE STILL OPPOSE THE BILL IN PRINT- AND THERE IS A NUMBER OF SERIOUS CONCERNS. OUR MEMBERS WERE TO REMEMBER CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL AND REVENGE PORN- EXCHANGING NOT ALLOWED. ON OUR OUR PLATFORMS- HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THANK YOU FOR THIRTY FIVE WHICH FRUSTRATE ONGOING EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AND REMOVE- THAT'S THE GENERAL BUT THAT'S REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AND EMPLOYMENT. BY INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES. FIRST THE BILLS OKAY TREE- TROUBLE BE USED TERROR THE PAIR AND WITH PORN. AND BANNER I EVEN THIS DECEMBER FOR HANDLING DUE TO HIGHLY SENSITIVE. STATUSES PUNCH. AND FOR THE REQUIRED- EXAMPLE THE BILL REQUIRES ALL COPIES OF THE ACTUAL MATERIAL SHOULDN'T BE DESTROYED OR RETURNED TO OPERATE US. RETURNING CCM EVEN SO THE VICTIM WOULD BE A TOTAL CARD- THE STRANGERS THAT WOULD SIMILARLY VIOLATED FEDERAL FORTY ONES WHICH ALSO REQUIRE PRESERVATION. DEPARTMENT BUT WOULD ALSO CRITICALLY AND EFFORTS TO DETER AND REMOVE ON. RIGHT HANDED PITCHER. ADDITIONALLY THE TWO DAY WINDOW TO JUST OR RETURN ACTUAL MATERIAL THEY'RE INTENDED TO INSPIRE QUICK ACTION COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. CURRENTLY THE BILL REQUIRES COMPANIES JACKSON TWO DAYS NOTICE- FROM THE VICTIM FACE SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES HOW ARE COMPANIES RESPONDING TO YOUR REPORT COMPILING OF CONTENT IN TIME OF POSSESSION FROM NATION OF VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE RECORDER. AS WELL AS I DID APPLY AND REMOVE THE OPTIONAL MATERIAL. FURTHERMORE OUR COMPANY TO GET CHANGE TRYING TO DISCERN IF THEIR CONTENT WAS THE PRODUCT OF COLLISION OR ANOTHER CRIME AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE SUBJECT IN THE VIDEO OR IMAGE WAS VERY.

THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND I WILL- I WILL GO QUICKLY- THANK YOU MANY OPPORTUNITIES JUSTIFYING THIS ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEDIA COALITION IS AN ASSOCIATION THAT PROTECTS THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO THE MAINSTREAM CREATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF. OF CONTENT- WE APPRECIATE THE SPONSOR AND THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURES CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLICATION OF CERTAIN PHOTOS WITHOUT CONSENT- THE HARMFUL PUBLICATION BUT WE THINK THIS BILL. STILL GOES TOO FAR WE REMAIN FOR NOW AT LEAST. RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. WE DID SUBMIT A MEMO IN OPPOSITION- EARLIER BUT I'M GONNA DO WHAT I'M GONNA SPEAK ABOUT IS THE BILL AS PUBLISH THE AMENDED VERSION IS PUBLISHED. BY JANUARY THIRD WE THINK THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT WERE MADE IN AND WE APPLAUD THEM APPRECIATE THEM THE ADDING THE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY ELEMENT TO THE EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY FOR EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY OR FREEIMAGES AND TAKE IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND ALSO THOSE. RELATED TO A MATTER OF PUBLIC CONCERN WHICH OFFERS SOME PROTECTION. FOR THE NEWS MEDIA PARTICULAR. AGAIN WHILE WE SUPPORT THESE CHANGES WE DO REMAIN- OPPOSE IT THIS TIME- PURCHASES A CONTENT BASED RESTRICTION ON SPEECH WE THINK IT'S VERY URGENT YOU KNOW VERY ESSENTIAL THAT IT BE DRAFTED SPECIFICALLY AND CAREFULLY TO- FIRST AMENDMENT WE THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL. KEY PROBLEMS AT THE FIRST IS THE LACK OF DEFINITIONS OF KEY TERMS NUDITY SEXUAL IN NATURE AND ALTER ALL ON DEFINING COULD. COULD REALLY BE INTERPRETED VERY BROADLY OR NARROWLY DEPENDING ON DIFFERENT CORDS- THERE'S A LACK OF AN ADEQUATE OR EVEN ANY KNOWLEDGE STANDARD IN THE PUBLICATION. KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHETHER THE IMAGES WERE OBTAINED HOW THEY WERE OBTAINED OUT THEY WERE CAPTURED- WHETHER IN FACT THE PERSON AND I CAN SEND IT ALL IF IT'S A IF IT'S AN INNOCENT REPUBLICATION OF AN IMAGE NOT BEING AWARE THERE WAS NO CONSENT IT LACKS ANY INTENDS OR- TO HARM ELEMENT- AND WE BELIEVE THE NOTICE PROVISION IS UNCLEAR AND CONFUSING.

NAKED AND SEXUAL I HAVE A COPY OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE DATED ONE TEN TWENTY TWO AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. ALL ALL REFERENCES TO NAKED AND SEXUAL HAVE BEEN DELETED AND- REPLACED WITH OBSCENE I DO HAVE YOU BEEN READING IT QUICKLY HAVE I MISSED ANY OF THAT. ACTUALLY ON THE- THANK YOU FOR SHARING THANK FOR THE QUESTIONS OR WHAT BECAUSE HE- BUT THE GOAL WITH SP THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE CURRENTLY AS OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT- ON JANUARY TENTH THIS DIVIDE- VICTIMS. THE REMEDY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THE CIVIL REMEDY BUT WHILE COMPLYING WITH LEGAL PRECEDENT BUT USING OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DEFINITION OF OBSCENITY WHICH YOU KNOW YOU'RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH AS AN ATTORNEY UNDER MILLER V. CALIFORNIA- THAT IS NOT PROTECTED SPEECH BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT- AGAIN BY DEFINITION AND- BY YOU US SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. AND SOLD TO CLARIFY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF IMAGES WITH GUNS DIRECTLY TO THE SUPREME COURT'S. IN THIS DEFINITION OF OBSCENITY SAYS AS REPLACEMENT FOR THAT LANGUAGE- THERE'S- LET ME STOP THERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT I THINK I SEE THAT'S THAT DEFINITION IS CAPTURED IN AMENDMENT NUMBER NINE WHICH IS IN. SECTION THREE LARGE CITY I GUESS MY QUESTION GOES TO AMENDMENT NUMBER SIX OR ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS. IT LOOKS IS THAT FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION IT READS TO THE CIVIL ACTION SHALL NOT SHALL NOT BE BROUGHT AGAINST AN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER OR AN ONLINE SERVICE OR INTERNET WEB SITE. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FOR PUBLISHING REPUBLISHING CONTENT CREATED BY THIRD PARTY UNLESS THE INTERNET PROVIDER ON LINE SERVICE. OR INTERNET WEBSITE EXPLICITLY ENCOURAGE SOLICITED AND INDUCED A THIRD PARTY. TO DISTRIBUTE THE ACTIONABLE MATERIAL. I DON'T KNOW I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT THE- CHECK WOULD NOT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD FALL IN THERE WHAT WHAT WOULD CHECK NEED TO DO TO ENCOURAGE. OR INDUCE A THIRD PARTY TO DISTRIBUTE THEM THAT THE PAPER IF THEY WERE JUST WILLFULLY. WILLFULLY WHICH IS PUTTING THINGS ON THE INTERNET WITHOUT REGARD WITH THAT. EXCLUDE THEM FROM A CIVIL CAUSE OF ACTION THE- CENTRE CORTESE HOPE YOU KEEP THAT QUESTION IN MIND FOR JUST A SECOND I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING- A NEW SERVER KELSEY REFERRED TO AMENDMENTS THERE THERE ARE. NO AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON THE FLOOR- AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND SENATOR CORTESE CAN RESPOND TO THIS THAT CENTER CORTESE IS COMMITTED TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AND IT'S NEXT COMMITTEE- AND SO THAT THERE'S NO. MISUNDERSTANDING AMONG MEMBERS OR THE PUBLIC THAT THAT THESE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN PRINT TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE BY THE COMMITTEE. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION CENTER CORTESE YOU KNOW FOR APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION AND- WANTED TO SAY THAT. VERY VERY CLEARLY. SHOULD ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THE NEW LANGUAGE- CITING SUPREME COURT CASES REPLACEMENT LANGUAGE- SO THAT'S A THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT TO CROSS THOSE AMENDMENTS GOING FORWARD- IN. SECTION TWO THIRTY FEDERAL SECTION TWO THIRTY IS REALLY. THE OTHER ISSUE BESIDES THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT REQUIRES NAVIGATION WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO COME IN AND PROTECT VICTIMS LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL CENTER WACO SKI- IN. RECENT CASE LAW. PUBLISHED OPINIONS- YOU KNOW SITE FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL SAN FERNANDO VALLEY VERSES ROOMMATES .COM- SAYS VERY VERY SPECIFICALLY IN IN IN THAT RULING. THAT THAT LANGUAGE THAT YOU JUST READ A REGARDING INDUCEMENT- SORT OF THE PROMOTIONAL NATURE OF ONLINE PLATFORMS THAT ARE INDUCING FOLKS- TO BRING CONTENT FORWARD- IS- IT HAS BEEN. RULED IN THAT CASE- TO NOT BE PROTECTED UNDER SECTION TWO THIRTY THAT SECTION TWO THIRTY DID IN FACT CONTEMPLATE A MORE PASSIVE- INTERNET BACK IN THE DAY. WHERE THE KIND OF PROMOTIONS THAT WE SEE. WITH ONLINE PLATFORMS TODAY WHICH ARE- ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO PAY A FEE AND UPLOAD CONTENT. REALLY DIDN'T EXIST UP BACK IN THE IN THE DAY WHEN SECTION TWO THIRTY WAS WAS CREATED BY OUR UNITED STATES CONGRESS SO SINCE THAT TIME THE COURTS HAVE. HAVE FINALLY. BEGUN TO- IF YOU WILL- BRING FORWARD RULINGS- THAT START TO PARSE OUT OF WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT INTERNET PLATFORM ISN'T. ACTUALLY PASSIVE IT ISN'T JUST THE PUBLIC SQUARE IT IS ACTUALLY A COMMERCIAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROCESS IN AND THEN AGAIN- AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THIS MOST RECENT CASE- THAT IS NOT PROTECTED. IN THEREFORE WE'VE GONE MUCH LIKE WE DID WITH THE SECURE SPRING COURT LANGUAGE ON OBSCENITY JUST LIFTED UP LANGUAGE STRAIGHT OUT OF THE PUBLISHED OPINION- AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO PUTTING THAT IN THE BILL- WHICH IS A PRETTY SEVERE LIMITATION ON THE BILL FRANKLY COMPARED TO WHERE IT WAS. IN PRINT JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. OKAY I'LL LEAVE IT THAT RESEARCHERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH BECAUSE HE I MEAN LET ME CLARIFY A FEW THINGS HERE FIRST WE'LL SEND A QUICK EASY I KNOW YOU WORK QUITE A BIT ON THIS BILL. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO CALIFORNIANS AND I KNOW THAT THAT WE ARE SOMEWHAT CONSTRAINED BY FEDERAL LAW HERE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT WE CAN. DO WHAT WE CAN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN AND SHOULD- YOU READ THE ANALYSIS IS LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL- WITH RESPECT TO THAT INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE FEDERAL LAW SECTION TWO THIRTY AND WHAT WE CAN DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA- OF. THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU AND I HAVE HAD OUR RESPECTIVE STAFFS OF HEAD. I KNOW YOU BIG KNOWLEDGE THAT AND- I'M CONCERNED WITH PASSING A BILL THAT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THESE ISSUES ADDRESSED HERE. BUT I KNOW YOU'VE COMMITTED YOU'VE COMMITTED AND AS IS I THINK CENTER WHAT CALCULUS TRADED. THAT YOU'VE DONE WORK TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS- CONCERNS CONCERT BUT WITH RESPECT TO NEARING NARROWING THE TYPE OF CONDUCT. THE BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS NAMELY LIMITING THE BUILD A DISTRIBUTION OF ACTION WITH MATERIAL. ADDRESSING THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS. INCLUDING CLEAR DEFINITIONS AND CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS AND EXCEPTIONS THERE ARE THE APPLICATIONS OF THE- HE'S IN ORDER TO ADDRESS. OUTSTANDING SECTION THIRTY ISSUES INCLUDING LIMITING LIABILITY FOR ONLINE SERVICES AND PLATFORMS TO WHERE THEY HAVE. EXPLICITLY ENCOURAGE SOLICITED OR INDUCE THE THIRD PARTY CONTENT CREATOR TO DISTRIBUTE. THE ACTUAL MATERIAL I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT CENTER CORTESE. YES AGAIN WE'RE COMMITTED TO- TO ACTUALLY- CROSSING THOSE MAMMOTH SPRING FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS- MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOU THOSE SO THAT I CAN COMMIT TO- TO THAT SPECIFIC DIRECTION GOING FORWARD. AND HE AND FRANKLY IT'S IN OUR INTEREST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL IS OPERATIONAL IN AND WORKS AND IT DOESN'T SET PEOPLE UP FOR FAILURE THROUGH THE LGAL SYSTEM AND IN ORDERTO DO THAT- THOSE CHANGES WOULD BE HAVE TO BE MADE- IN ADDITION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ANOTHER PROCEDURAL ISSUES THAT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION JUST THIS MORNING- THAT WE NEED TO GET A LITTLE MORE CLEAR. ON WHO HAS STANDING IF THE INTENT IS THAT VICTIMS AND ONLY VICTIMS HAVE STANDING. YOU KNOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW CIVIL ACTION CREATED UNDER UNDER THIS BILL BUT WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IN THE BILL- SO WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES SO THAT THERE'S NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THANK YOU I THINK THAT THIS. IS A- PIECE OF WORK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE MAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IT AGAIN HERE AND IN SENATE JUDICIARY SO THANK YOU SIR CORTESE FOR THOSE COMMITMENTS. OTHERS WISHING TO COMMENT I SEE SENATOR WIENER'S MICROPHONE UP CENTER WINNER. IF THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- THESE ARE MUCH LOUDER THAN THEY USED TO BE- AND I WANT TO THANK THE- AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT. ISSUE THE IDEA OF- PEOPLE HAVING- SEXUAL IMAGES AND VIDEOS OF THEMSELVES- POSTED WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT MAYBE YOU. DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THAT. THAT THE VIDEO OR THE- OR THE PHOTO EXISTED AT ALL IT'S POSTED- AND I AGREE THAT. THERE CURRENTLY IS NOT ENOUGH IN TERMS OF REMEDY TO GET. THIS MALICIOUS. ARE REALLY DESPICABLE. OUR CONTENT- DOWN. AND GET IT DONE QUICKLY- AND SO I FULLY SUPPORT WHAT THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS. ARE TRYING TO DO HERE. AND I COMMEND THEM FOR TAKING ON WHAT IS A VERY VERY THORNY DIFFICULT ISSUE AND WE- HEARD ABOUT THE SORT OF THORNY. ISSUES AROUND A CALL IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND AROUND. A FEDERAL LAW- AND I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR WILL BE WORKING TO RESOLVE. THE ISSUES ON THE SPECIFIC- CONCERN THAT I HAVE WHICH I'VE SPOKEN TO THE AUTHOR- ABOUT HAS TO DO WITH- THE IMPACT OF THE BILL ON SEX WORKERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE. MAKING THEIR LIVING- ONLINE AND AS A TOLL OF PERFORMERS- AND- THE CONCERN IS THAT WITH- THERE'S A HUGE INCENTIVE FOR PLATFORM SYSTEM TO REMOVE. CONTENT IF COMPLAINTS ARE FILED- AND- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A WHOLE ARMY OF. RIGHT WING ANTI**** PEOPLE WHO RUN AROUND JUST FLOODING EVERYTHING- BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY PENALTIES AND THE DIFFICULTY OF- ASCERTAINING WITHIN TWO DAYS OF SOMEONE HAS OCCURRED HAS CONSENTED. ON YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THE SEX WORKERS IT'LL PERFORMERS BE. HARMED AS A RESULT I THINK THAT THAT'S A CONCERN- AND SO IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH FOR ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- I WILL SAY THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE OPPONENTS. OF THE BILL- SOME OF THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WHO WE WORK WITH ARE REGULARLY- AND ALSO- WHO ARE NOT CATEGORICALLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL THEY THEY ALSO WANT TO- ADDRESS DID REALLY REAL HARM THAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO GET I THOUGHT A CATEGORICAL OPPOSITION- THEY WANT TO SEE SOME. CHANGES IN THE AUTHOR HAS ALSO EXPRESSED TO ME THAT HE'S ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO WORK WITH- AND I'VE COMMITTED AT ALL I TRY TO FACILITATE- THOSE CONNECT THEM WITH- A WAY I CAN THE COMING MONTHS- AND SO I ANTICIPATE THIS BILL WILL BE MOVING FORWARD TODAY- BUT LIKE I SAID IT'S TOUGH FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT. IN THE CURRENT FORM GIVEN SOME OF THESE CONCERNS- BUT I AM VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THIS COULD TO THE POINT WHERE I WILL BE ABLE TO THROUGH THE OPTICALLY SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER- ANY OTHERS WISHING TO COMMENT OR HAVE A QUESTION. SEEING NO MICROPHONES RAISED. UP ONLINE WE HAVE A- QUESTION OR COMMENT. FROM A SENATE SENATOR STERN GO AHEAD SENATOR STERN.

CENTER WHY CASKEY AND- THE AUTHOR- THE AUTHOR WOULD MIND CLARIFYING- YEAH WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED. ED CHANGES I APPRECIATE SORT OF THE- YEAH A LITTLE BIT THE DETAIL WAS GIVEN ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THE MECHANICS WORK OF A CIVIL REMEDY THROUGH- THROUGH THIS CHANGE FROM. DAY TO OBSCENITY ARE THERE OTHER ELEMENTS BESIDES THAT. SWITCH TO OBSCENITY. IF I'M THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- SECRETARIES YOU DO WANT TO ADDRESS THOSE IN YOUR CLOTHES OR WOULD YOU PREFER AT THIS POINT LET ME SEE IF I CAN DO A QUICK SUMMARY I KNOW WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE CLOSE BUT- JUST IN CASE THERE'S ANY FOLLOW UP- I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH SENATOR STERN PARTICIPATING IN THE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS THAT YOU- THAT YOU AUTHORIZED- MISTER CHAIR DURING A RECESS IN. OF I KNOW THEREFORE HE'S QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THESE ISSUES AROUND THE SECTION TWO THIRTY AND SOME OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES THAT WERE DRESSES. PURSUANT TO YOUR OWN QUESTION- IT AT THAT HEARING CENTER STORE AND WE'RE- YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT OBSCENITY IS NOT PROTECTED SPEECH UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT- WE REALLY WANTED TO GO RIGHT TO THAT DEFINITION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NEARLY TEARING THE BILL IN THAT REGARD. UGH WHEN THE ISSUES BUT NUMBER ONE THE BILL NARROWS WHAT TYPE OF CONDUCT THE BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS NAMELY LIMITING THE BILL TO DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIONABLE MATERIAL- DISTRIBUTION NOT. PASSIVE FOR EXAMPLE. A TWO ADDRESS COST. CONCERNS CLEARER DEFINITIONS AND NECESSARY EXCEPTIONS THAT WOULD INCLUDE- THE EIGHT THE OBSCENITY LANGUAGE IN MILLER VERSUS CALIFORNIA THAT I TALKED ABOUT A MINUTE AGO- NO LIABILITY FOR DISTRIBUTORS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TYPICALLY MANY OF THOSE WOULD BE- PROTECTIONS FOR. OUR CLASSIC NEWS- SERVICES WHICH- MAY OR MAY NOT END UP WITH IMAGES- WITHOUT CONSENT- FOR EXAMPLE WITH NO EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. AND THEN A MEMBER SUBSCRIBER THE LANGUAGE IN SECTION ONE A. RELATING TO MAKING IN OBTAINING THE TO FIND ACTIONABLE MATERIAL. STRIKING THE WORD MAKING WILL PREVENT A SITUATION WHERE DEFENDANT CAN FILE A COUNTERSUIT. IF A PLAINTIFF ORIGINALLY MADE THE MATERIAL- IF SOMEONE TAKES A NUDE PHOTO OF THEMSELVES FOR EXAMPLE AND SENDS IT TO THEIR PARTNER WHO LATER DISTRIBUTED. IN THE NEXT SINCE THE POSSESSION OF CHILD **** IS ALREADY ILLEGAL WE ARE STRIKING THE WORD OBTAINING IN THE SECTION AS WELL. THE DEFINITION OF ACTUAL MATERIAL IN. SUBPART H. E. I. ALREADY INCLUDES MATERIAL THAT IS OBTAINED BY TRICKERY OR SUB PROVIDERS. WERE STOLEN. AND THEN THIRD AND LASTLY NARROWS THE APPLICATION OF THE BILL TO CERTAIN PARTIES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUTSTANDING FEDERAL SECTION TWO THIRTY ISSUES- YOU ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THAT- IN THE DIALOGUE- BACK AND FORTH WITH SENATOR WHAT KASKI- SO THAT PRETTY WELL SUMMARIZES WHERE WE'RE AT AND I JUST INDICATED THAT WE CERTAINLY EXPECT THERE WILL BE.

MMHM THANK YOU- THE CENTER SERVES IN SANTA CRUZ BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR THEY'RE NOT AMENDMENTS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME THAT THAT YOU AND I HAD A COLLOQUY ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENTS TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD BUT I DON'T WANT TO CREATE ANY CONFUSION THAT THERE THAT THE BILL IS ACTUALLY. EITHER AMENDED OR THAT WE ARE VOTING ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT'S CORRECT RIGHTS AND ACCORDING TO THIS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN OUR WHAT I JUST READ THROUGH IS JUST AS A SUMMARY OF DRAFT AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ARE NOT ON THE FLOOR TODAY A BETTER COMMUNITY BY THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU- SENATOR STERN DIDN'T INTERRUPT WE FINISHED NO NO I'M TRYING TO DIGEST HERE- THAT WAS A LOT SO I TRIED TO TAKE NOTES- LOT OF MOVING.

THANK YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS- THIS IS BILL SB THREE OH ONE WHICH DEALS WITH ONLINE. RETAIL THEFT USING OUR ONLINE MARKETPLACES SO I WANT TO START WITH THAT I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS WHICH REMOVES THE PREEMPTION CLAUSE THEY CREATE A NEXUS TO SALES IN AND INTO CALIFORNIA. OF THE WHICH ADDRESSES THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE ISSUE AND CLARIFYING AN AMENDMENT THAT CONSUMER REPORT FEATURE IS FOR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY OF THIRD PARTY SELLERS AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT THOSE OF THE AMENDMENTS ON COMMON FIVE ON PAGE TEN ANALYSIS YES THEY ARE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. SO- WHAT I WANTED. WE HAVE SEEN LOTS OF PRESS REPORTS ABOUT RETAIL THEFT BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY SEEING IS A GROWING NUMBER OF ORGANIZED CRIME RINGS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN VERY- ORGANIZED IN LARGE SCALE RETAIL THEFT. IN THERE SO THESE ARE NOT THE TYPE OF- STEPS THAT ARE THEN- YOU KNOW FENCING OUT OF A FLEA MARKET OR- YOU KNOW THE BACK OF A CAR WHATEVER. INSTEAD MANY TIMES WE ARE SEEING THAT THEY ARE USING ONLINE MARKETPLACES TO IN EFFECT FENCE THE STOLEN GOODS. AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED BILLION IN STOLEN AND COUNTERFEIT ITEMS ARE SOLD ON ONLINE MARKETPLACES ANNUALLY. THIS IS HARMFUL NOT ONLY TO RETAILERS BUT ALSO TO CONSUMERS BECAUSE CONSUMERS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE KID THE PROTECTIONS RELATED TO THOSE GOODS WHEN THEY ARE- STOLEN WHETHER IT'S HEALTH PROTECTIONS OR OTHERS- THE PURPOSE OF SP THREE OH ONE IS TO HELP COMBAT THE SALE OF STOLEN GOODS ON ONLINE MARKETPLACES. BY PROVIDING HIGHER STANDARDS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND IDENTITY VERIFICATION FOR SELLERS WHO USE SUCH MARKETPLACES SO REQUIRE SELLERS WITH OVER FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR IN SALES TO ANNUALLY REPORT VERIFICATION INFO TO THE MARKET PLACE- FOR EXAMPLE BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER BUSINESS TAX DOCUMENTS CONTACT INFORMATION. AND IT REQUIRES THE PLATFORMS TO PROVIDE A LINK FOR CONSUMERS FOR REPORTING POTENTIAL FRAUD. OF OR SALE OF- BEST STOLEN OR COUNTERFEIT GOODS AND IT PROHIBITS SELLERS FROM ENGAGING IN SALES IF THEY FAIL TO PROVIDE VERIFICATION AND I'D LIKE TO ASK MY WITNESSES MARGARET LAST SEEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. AND CHRISTINE'S ORDERED TO BURY WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PROSECUTOR'S ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER AND IN THE SAME GROUND RULES APPLY THIS BILL AS OTHERS- EACH SIDE WILL HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT WITH TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES EACH HAVING TWO MINUTES. FOLLOWED UP BY THOSE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION JUST GIVING US THEIR NAME THEIR AFFILIATION AND THE POSITION ON THE BILL SO- MISS CLASS IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. PLEASE PROCEED HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WILL PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB THREE ON ONE. THANK YOU YOUR SCANNER SCANNER PRINTER MAKING SPENCER AND HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. THE RECENT RISE IN ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME IS DRIVEN BY MULTIPLE FACTORS ONE OF THE KEY UNDERLYING CAUSES THE RELATIVE EASE WITH WHICH KEYS IN ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME RINGS CAN SELL STOLEN GOODS OR ONLINE MARKETPLACE ACCOUNT. EVEN COUNCIL NOW OVERSEE RINGS BEHIND BEHIND PHONY UNVERIFIED BUSINESS NAMES AND OPEN UP A GLOBAL MARKET ABOUT SUSPECTING CUSTOMERS. WITHOUT THE LIMITATIONS IN SENTENCING ITEMS IN PERSON OUR C. BECOMES EVEN MORE PROFITABLE. INVESTIGATORS BUSTING OVERSEEN WORKS LIKE FINDING. HELP ON MULTIPLE ONLINE MARKETPLACE. FOR MORE THAN A DECADE RETAILER AND SHOT LET. TO TURN CRIMINAL. ON MARKET PLACE. SOME OF THE HAVE BOMB SOME PLACE HAVE BEEN. INCREASED THEIR THE TURKOMAN BECAUSE- ON THE SITE HOWEVER THIS ACTIVITY IT UNFORTUNATELY STILL PREVALENT WITH XCELERATED GROWTH IN BULK ONLINE RETAIL IN ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME INDUSTRY WIDE STANDARD IF NEEDED IN LAW. SB THRILL ONE MORE COMPLEX THREE SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT THINGS IT WILL PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH CLEAR VERIFIED INFORMATION ABOUT THE INTERNET SELLERS. DETER INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DEFENSE STILL NINE ANSWER COUNTERFEIT ITEMS USING ONLINE MARKETPLACES BY ELIMINATING THE ABILITY TO CONCEAL THEIR IDENTITY AND PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE ABILITY TO CONTACT OWNERS ONLINE ACCOUNT MAY BE CONFUSED OR COUNTERFEIT PROPERTY. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FEDERAL SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IF CONGRESS FAILS TO ACT IN THAT CURRENT SECTION WE ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS SHOULD TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE AND PROTECT CONSUMERS BY PASSING THIS BILL. THIS IS ONE IMPORTANT STEP IN CURBING ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME. I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS HONESTLY THREE A LAND. THANK YOU MISS CLASS STEEN ALL ARE ON THE- IS- MISS CHRISTY SO TO BURY. MISSILE BERRY ARE YOU AVAILABLE CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN. RIGHT I'M CHRISTINE SO THERE'S A VERY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PROSECUTOR'S ONLINE THE CALIFORNIA AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT WE WORK WITH ALL PRIORITIZED INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF RETAIL ORGANIZED RETAIL. IN THE- FOR THE GOVERNOR C. H. P. TASK FORCE WAS LAID BY REGIONAL INVESTIGATIONS THAT ORIGINATED IN AFRICA AT THE AGE SHOWN THAT LARGE SOPHISTICATED OPERATION ARE BEHIND SOME OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS. BUT PERSONALLY HE CAUGHT ON VIDEO STEALING FROM THE STORE IT'S OFTEN A SMALL PLAYER IN A MUCH LARGER MUCH MORE LUCRATIVE SCHEME THE PEOPLE TRULY PROFITING AND DIRECTING THE OPERATIONS ARE PEOPLE THANKING THE STOLEN GOODS AND RESELLING THEM OFTEN FROM BEHIND A COMPUTER SCREEN. IN THE SAN FRANCISCO DA'S OFFICE PARTICIPATED IN THE MULTI AGENCY IN. ADDITION I'M COVERING SELLING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN STOLEN GOODS YOUR ONLINE MARKET PLACE. THERE'S A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN MILLION INSTALLING PRODUCTS. FOCUSING ON THE HIGHER END OF THE PROBLEM YIELD MUCH GREATER RESULTS. BUT WE CAN SHRINK THE MARKET PLACE FOR THE STOLEN GOODS WE WILL SEE A REDUCTION IN RETAIL AFTER. A SIMILAR APPROACH WAS TAKING A CELLPHONE ROBBERIES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WHEN WE PROPOSED IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL REQUIRING. KILL SWITCH AND BE INSTALLED UNCLE. WE SAW A 50% READ. IN OR TELEPHONE MY PLACE OUT. AND PROSECUTORS WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS THE DRIVERS OF ORGANIZED RETAIL. INCLUDING THE EASE WITH WHICH STOLEN GOODS CAN BE ANONYMOUSLY SOLD ONLINE. THE THRILL ONE WILL HELP REQUIRING MICHAEL PLACES TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION WILL DISCOURAGE ORGANIZED RETAIL OPERATIONS AND WILL FACILITATE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION. COLLECTING BANKING INFORMATION WILL ALLOW US TO COORDINATE THE FREEZING OF FUNDS BUT THOSE THAT ARE CONDUCTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WELL THERE'S- CALIFORNIA CAN LEAVE NOW.

SIXTY THREE CENTER SKINNER CLOSURES THANK YOU SO MUCH CHEER MEMBERS I'M- PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU. OUR RESOLUTION ON THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT RULING IN ROE VERSUS WADE AND I'LL START WITH ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENT THERE WAS A GOOD- LANGUAGE ADJUSTMENT ACCEPTING THAT- JUST USE THAT ON THE EROTIC BUT I WILL PLEASE. JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE ON THE SAME SHEET OF MUSIC MOMENTS IN COMMENTS SIX ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS YES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. OKAY COM SO AS I MENTIONED FORTY NINE YEARS AGO. THE US SUPREME COURT RULED IN ROE VERSUS WADE THAT A WOMAN HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THAT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY INCLUDES HER RIGHT TO ABORTION. BEFORE ROE VERSUS WADE AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT TWO MILLION WOMEN IN THE U. S. EVERY YEAR. RESORTED TO AN ILLEGAL ABORTION. END EACH YEAR. AMONGST THOSE UNSAFE ABORTIONS COST AS MANY AS FIVE THOUSAND DEATHS. NOW LOW INCOME WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AT RISK BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS ABLE TO TRAVEL TO AN AREA OF THE COUNTRY WERE SAFE PROCEDURE WAS BEING PERFORMED WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THEM MONETARY RESOURCES. TO PAY FOR A DOCTOR AND DOCTORS AND THEN EVEN WHEN IT WAS ILLEGAL THERE WERE DOCTORS WHO OFFERED THE PROCEDURE BUT FOR VERY HIGH COST. SIX SEVEN. EVEN WITH THAT PROBLEM OF THE ILLEGALITY BEING FIXED BY THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING IN ROE V. WADE STATES HAVE CONTINUED TO CHIP AWAY AT OUR ACCESS TO LEGAL LEGAL ABORTION AARON TO THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT WE NEED. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO TEXAS DEALT A BLOW TO ROW WHEN THEY PASSED S. B. H. AND IT WENT INTO EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE A HUNDRED AND SIX RESTRICTIONS WERE PASSED BY VARIOUS STATES AND OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED. NEW STATE LEVEL RESTRICTIONS WERE ENACTED. AND AFFECTING ALMOST FORTY PERCENT. OF THE ROUTER ACCOUNTING 440% OF ALL THE RESTRICTIONS SINCE THE ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION. NOW FOR SUPREME COURT DECIDES TO OVERTURN ROE OR ALLOWS STATE BANDS TO REMAIN. IT WILL RESULT IN OVER HALF OF THE STATES IN THE US. TO BASICALLY DENY ABORTION CARE ACCESS WHICH MEANS THEN THAT THE POPULATION OF THOSE STATES WOULD BE DENIED THAT CARE. STUDIES SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA COULD SEE A- SIGNIFICANT CLOSE 23000% INCREASE IN OUT OF STATE PEOPLE TRAVELING HERE TO GET THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THEY NEED. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SO ACCURATELY STATES S. R. SIXTY THREE REAFFIRMS CALIFORNIA'S STRONG SUPPORT FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING THEIR OWN PREGNANCY AND THEIR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. AND IT URGES THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO SUPPORT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION SPECIFICALLY AS WELL AS OUR ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. NOW I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES MOLLY ROBESON FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND RBC FLED FROM THE BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER- MISS MOLLY ROBSON. WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD. PLANNED PARENTHOOD ARE YOU AVAILABLE. GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. HI MY REFERENCE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP OTHERS. CALIFORNIA I WANT TO THANK SENATOR SKINNER FOR HER LEADERSHIP OFFERING THE CONVOLUTION AND CELEBRATING ACCORDING TO HER STORY ABOUT HISTORIC ROE V. WADE SUPREME COURT DECISION WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHT TO ABORTION IN THE UNITED STATES. WE CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY EVERY YEAR BUT THIS YEAR AS YOU ALL KNOW IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THERE IS CURRENTLY A CASE BEFORE THE US SUPREME COURT BETTER ACTUALLY CHALLENGES THE LEGAL PROTECTION GRANTED EN ROUTE. PLANNING THE DECISION FROM THE SUPREME COURT IN THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE STATED THAT TWENTY SIX STATES ARE LIKELY TO BAN OR SEVERELY RESTRICT ABORTION. I WANTED TO MENTION ABOUT HALF OF THE STATES IN THE UNITED STATES POTENTIALLY LOSING ACCESS TO ABORTION WHICH COULD IMPACT THIRTY SIX MILLION ONE AND MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE BECAUSE PREGNANT. WE'LL BE WAITED JUST A FLOOR AND WE'RE FORTUNATE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA WITH LEADERS. AND BE PRODUCTIVE FREEDOM ORGANIZATION I KNOW I UNDERSTAND ABORTION HEALTH CARE AND THAT ANYTHING LESS THAN EQUITABLE ACT THAT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD ACCESS TO CARE I LIVE IN RURAL AREAS OF OUR STATE. WE WILL NOT STOP FIGHTING TO PROTECT THE RIGHT PORTION AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACCESS BOTH FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THOSE WHO ARE FORCED TO SEEK CARE STATE. THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING AND THANK YOU CHAIR FOR HEARING US TODAY- AND BRINGING AWARENESS TO THE PUBLISHED AND COMPARATIVE PRODUCTS. R. S. R. SIXTY THREE.

I LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR SCANNER AND THE COMMITTEE FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION THAT AFFIRMED AGAIN THAT CALIFORNIA IS A STATE THAT HONORS AND RESPECTS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE. WHEN AND HOW PEOPLE WANT TO CREATE FAMILY. BUT IN THIS TIME I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. IN OUR STATE AND IN AND IN OUR COUNTRY. NO MATTER WHERE CAN BE THAT THERE WELL I LOOKED. OVER V. WADE. WHAT ALREADY STATED THAT OVER. OF FEET LOOK ARTICLE TO END UP. OR COULD BARELY OF ONE ACCESS. A MOMENT THAT WE WILL KNOW **** LOW INCOME AND WOMEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY HARD. BUT IN THESE MOMENTS IS WHERE CALIFORNIA CAN BE A BEACON OF HOPE. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REIMAGINE WHAT FULL ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE TO LOOK LIKE. GROUNDED IN THE REPRODUCTIVE DOCTOR THE VALUES THAT'S IN OUR DIGNITY. THAT WE COULD SAY THAT RELATIVE OR NOT THE FEELING. THAT WE COULD DO MORE TO ADDRESS THE INTERSECTIONAL AND MULTI. FACTOR EVE THE THIRTEEN FOLKS. EATING BLUEPRINT NOT ONLY WHAT IT LIKE THAT. HIM DOUBLE. ACCESS BUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS TWEETS AT ITS CORE. THANK YOU ACTUALLY THE ISSUES THAT ARE LEGAL ABORTIONS LIKE HOUSING FAIR PAY CRIMINAL. AND CHILD CARE. THE FULL ABORTION MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING. ABORTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO. BE PREGNANT AND NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE A STATE HAVE. THE APPS FAIL TO PROVIDE THE SPEAKING FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. UNDERSTAND THE LAST MOMENT AFTER THIS BODY TO LOOK AT THIS RESOLUTION ABOUT SALLY **** RALLY ALL. ON HOW WE CAN CHALLENGE OURSELVES INTERSTATE THE REDEFINED TWINS WITH DIGNITY AFTER DINNER. THE BOLDLY AND COURAGEOUSLY B. ON AUG UNAPOLOGETIC IN OUR DEDICATION ON ANY.

ANYONE IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE MY MATTER MODERATOR. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT LET'S TURN THE OPPOSITION- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BEGINNING WITH MYSTERIES OF BRENNAN OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. MISBRANDING YOUR PRESENT HERE IN THE CHAMBER GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN- BURKE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM THERESA BRENNAN PRESIDENT OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE AMERICA'S FIRST PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION FOUNDED IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. I AM NOT HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE BABY IN THE WOMB I AM HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT WOMEN. THE TRUTH IS MANY WOMEN SEEK ABORTIONS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. MILLIONS OF WOMEN ARE SUFFERING DEEPLY BECAUSE THEY CHOSE ABORTION AND REGRETTED IT. THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR MIND AND BRING THAT CHILD BACK TO LIFE SO IF IT IS A DECISION THEY ARE MAKING A CRISIS IT MAY BE A DECISION THAT HAUNTS THEM FOR EVER. LAND PARENTHOOD DOES NOT PROVIDE COUNSELING SERVICES FOR WOMEN DEVASTATED AFTER ABORTION WE DO. WE SEE FIRST HAND HOW HEART BREAKING THE AFTERMATH OF ABORTION CAN BE. THAT MARKER INSTITUTE STATISTICS SHOW THAT ABORTION ARE AT OR BELOW POVERTY LEVEL 75% AND THE MAJORITY ARE MINORITY WOMEN. S. R. SIXTY THREE IS A TRAVESTY. ABORTIONS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY PERFORMED ON LOW INCOME MINORITY WOMEN WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NO VOICE. CALIFORNIA IS OFFERING THEM FREE OF PORTION WHICH HAS A HEAVY DISPARATE RACIAL IMPACT RATHER THAN GIVING THEM THE HELP THEY NEED TO MAKE THE CHOICE THEY MAY ACTUALLY PREFER TO HAVE THEIR CHILD. MANY WOMEN WHO ARE AVAILING THEMSELVES OF WHAT YOU CALL A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. ARE NOT DOING SO BECAUSE THEY VIEW IT AS THEIR BEST OPTION THEY ARE DOING SO BECAUSE THEY VIEW IT AS THEIR ONLY OPTION. LET'S FIX THAT TOGETHER NOT BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO ABORTION BY PROVIDING HELP MOTHERS NEED TO MAKE THE DECISION THEY MAY ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE NOT THE ONE THEY FEEL IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS IS THEIR ONLY OPTION. THANK YOU MISS BRANDON NEXT WE HAVE. A WIN AT SILLS THE CALIFORNIA FOR LIFE ORGANIZATION. HELLO GO AHEAD WHEN IT IT'LL- THANK YOU MY NAME IS WHEN IT SOLD A SERVICE A DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS FOR LIFE I AM CALLING TODAY FROM THE PUBLIC SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF OUR COUNTRY'S LARGEST ABORTION BUSINESS PLANNED PARENTHOOD. ABORTIONS ARE DONE HERE EVERY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AFTER TWENTY WEEKS OF PREGNANCY WHICH IS HAPPENING AS I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY THIS IS A GRUESOME BARBARICTO DAY PROCEDURE WHICH REQUIRES THE DISMEMBERMENT AND DECAPITATION OF THE CHILD IN THE WORLD. S. R. SIXTY THREE WAS CELEBRATING THE DISMEMBERMENT AND DECAPITATION OF SO CALLED. ONE THIRD OR INCONVENIENT HAPPY RESOLUTION SURELY WOMEN AND CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER THAN ABORTION I HAVE MET THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE ARRIVED HERE THINKING THAT THEIR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SO DIFFICULT THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING ENDING THE LIFE OF THEIR CHILD. YET MANY WOMEN WILL CHANGE THEIR MIND WHEN GIVING GIVEN LOBBYING HELP ASSISTANCE RESOURCES AND ENCOURAGEMENT IN FACT A BABY WAS SAVED HERE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO WHILE I WAS ON HOLD. JUST THINK WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SURPLUS COULD DO TO ACTUALLY HELP WOMEN SOLVE. THESE OFTENTIMES FIXABLE PROBLEMS RATHER THAN JUST PROMOTING MORE AND MORE ABORTIONS. WE DON'T END POVERTY BY KILLING POOR CHILDREN WOMEN COME OUT OF THIS BUILDING WALKING WOUNDED FROM HURTING SO BADLY THEY ARE BARELY ABLE TO GET TO THEIR CAR. LEAVING MANY WOMEN WOMEN TO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION ANXIETY PANIC ATTACKS NIGHTMARES DRUG ALCOHOLIC ADDICTION AND THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE. FOR YEARS TO COME ESPECIALLY WOMEN WHO ARE LIED TO AND TOLD QUOTE IT'S JUST A COMPLEX- WE HERE FOLLOW THE SCIENCE WELL SCIENCE PROVES THAT HUMANITY OF THE CHILD IN THE WOMB. EVERYONE HAS HEARD THE SOUND OF A BABY'S HEART BEAT WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF A BABY MOVING HER ARMS AND LEGS HER FATE. ALL OF WHICH ARE D. UNDENIABLY HUMAN.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN OUR COLLEAGUES SP TWO SEVENTY ONE- EXPANDS- THE SOURCES OF PERSPECTIVE FEDERAL JURORS TO INCLUDE STATE TAX FILERS TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE JURY POOL COLORS YOU MAY REMEMBER- SEVERAL YEARS AGO I AUTHORED AND WE GOT SIGNED INTO LAW SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY TWO WHICH EXPANDED OUR STATE JURY ROLLS- TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE TAXPAYER ROLE. IN AND NOT JUST LIMIT THE JURY POOL TO DMV AND VOTER REGISTRATION FILES OF THIS BILL SIMPLY ALSO ALLOW THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO PROVIDE. TAXPAYER LIST TO THE FEDERAL COURTS TO THE FEDERAL COURTS CAN ALSO EXPAND THEIR JURY POOL- WE KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE A FAIR JUSTICE SYSTEM WE NEED A JURY POOL THAT REFLECTS THE COMMUNITY- THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF DRAWING OUR JURY POOLS FROM ONLY DMB AND VOTER REGISTRATION OUR- VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASES- DOES NOT CREATE A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT BROAD ENOUGH. AND INCLUDING ALL TAXPAYERS- WILL MAKE OUR JURY POOL MUCH MORE REPRESENTATIVES- SO AGAIN WE ENACTED THIS REFORM- WITH PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OF COURSE- FOR OUR STATE- SUPERIOR COURT- JURIES AND THE FEDERAL COURTS THEN CAME TO US AND ASKED TO BE INCLUDED- BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE FEDERAL COURTS TECHNICALLY HAVE THE POWER TO COMPEL THE STATE. TO PRIVATE INFORMATION- THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND THEY WOULD RATHER ODD THE STATE SIMPLY AGREED TO DO IT- AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS ASKED FOR STATUTORY. AUTHORIZATION TO DO THAT THE BUILDER CREATE PROTECT. ARE RULE SERVICES ON IMPORTANT STEP IN OUR QUEST FOR. FAIRER AND FAIRER JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER I VOTE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY- IS JUDGE WILLIAM ALSUP A SENIOR DISTRICT JUDGE. EMMA IN THE US DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ANALYSTS KNOW WHERE WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF. OPERATIONS. ALSO FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ALTHOUH UNLIKE JUDGES WERE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS I AM PROUD TO DISCLOSE THAT THE JUDGE ALSO BUT I WERE PARTNERS ON THIRTEEN YEARS AGO- JUDGE ALSO FOR YOU AVAILABLE. WE'RE GETTING HIM ON THE LINE WITH THE BLUES NOWHERE. ALL RIGHTS IS WELL WHEN WE GO AHEAD WITH THIS KNOW WHERE IF SHE'S ON THE LINE. OKAY THANK-YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I ENLIST NOWHERE AND I OVERSEE JURY SERVICES FOR THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND- ALTIMETER WEINER SAID WE APPROACHED HIM WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT AFTER BEING THE BILL THAT HE WAS ABLE TO PASS THE BENEFITS REPORT THROUGHOUT-CALIFORNIA- IT WILL SIMILARLY BENEFIT THE STATE BY MAKING A FEDERAL JURY IS MORE CLOSELY REPRESENT THE INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY- CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THAT THIS COURT AND ALL FEDERAL COURT SIR- JUDGE OFTEN WILL GET INTO THIS A BIT MORE BUT I JUST WANT TO MENTION VERY BRIEFLY BUT THERE HAS BEEN RESEARCH STUDIES SHOWING THAT RACIALLY. DIVERSE JURY. IN A BROADER ARRAY. OF ISSUES IN THEIR DELIVERY AND YOUR ACTUAL AIR SO THAT'S ONE REASON AMONG MANY THAT ARE. UNDER JUDGE ALL THE LEADERSHIP AND- INCREDIBLY DEVOTED TO INCREASING THE REPRESENTATIVE NESS OF. OUR JURY. WHEN THIS COURT ADDED THE DMV LISTS TO OUR REGIONAL SPORTS LEFT WHICH WITH THE VOTER REGISTRATION BACK IN THE NINETIES WE SAW AN IMMEDIATE pREPRESENTATIONS OF BLACK LATINOS AND ASIAN AMERICANS. IN A QUALIFIED JURY POOL. WE RECENTLY HAD EXPERTS. FROM THE CENTER FOR JURY STUDIES A NATIONWIDE EATING THE ISSUE ANALYZER JURY POOL AND THEY FOUND THAT INCLUSION OF ANOTHER FORKLIFT WOULD BRING IN THE COURT EVEN CLOSER TO ITS GOAL OF PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY AND THIS IN TURN INCREASES PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE VERDICT RENDERED BY OUR JURY. THERE'S A PARTICULAR REASON WHY THE LIST OF HIGH FILERS FROM THE FTP WILL BE SO HELPFUL ABOUT 20% OF THE SUMMONSES THAT OUR COURT SENDS OUT- RETURNED UNDELIVERABLE. HE'S UNDELIVERABLE PROMISES COME FROM THE MORE MOBILE CALIFORNIA NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHO ARE TYPICALLY RENTERS AND TEND TO BE MORE MINORITY AND LOW INCOME. BECAUSE MOST CALIFORNIANS ARE REQUIRED TO INTERACT WITH THE F. T. B. ANNUALLY WE BELIEVE THE ADDRESSES FROM THE FTP WILL BE FRESHER THAN THOSE FROM VOTER REGISTRATION OR THE DMV AND I THINK COMMUNITIES WILL BE EQUALLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO REACH THEM WITH PEOPLE FREQUENTLY CONCERT I'M SORRY. OUR FINDINGS MANY CALIFORNIANS DON'T THANK YOU YEAH WE'RE ALL RIGHT- SHOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE. THE MONEY HERE ALL RIGHT JUDGE GO AHEAD. YES TWENTY ONE WILLIAM ALL CLUB FROM A JUDGE.

I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU. ALREADY THANK YOU- ANYONE WISH TO S. COMMENT OR QUESTION CENTER BORCHERS. THANK YOU GERMAN. AFTER REVIEWING THIS MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS IS THERE AN ISSUE AND I THINK THERE IS- I WANTED TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR- IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS THAT- RELY ON CONVENING JURIES IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE REFLECTIVE. OF THE COMMUNITY HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND IF IT HASN'T GONE UNNOTICED. THAT I AM COLD. EVERY SINGLE STATUTORILY AVAILABLE TIME PERIOD IN THE ODDS OF THAT ARE JUST YOU IT DOESN'T WORK AND THE REASON WHY EVEN AFTER I'VE CONSULTED WITH- WITH FOLKS IN THE CLERK'S OFFICE IN THE COURT SYSTEM IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T RESPOND THEY HAVE BAD ADDRESSES AND THE POOL FROM WHICH THEY MUST DRAW IS FAIRLY LIMITED AND THEY JUST KEEP ON CHURNING AND RECIRCULATED. AND SO I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY OPTION THAT EXISTS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE MORE UP TO DATE INFORMATION TO EXPAND THAT JURY POOL BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE NOT FULFILLING THE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE UNDER OUR COURT SYSTEM WITH THE- A JURY OF OUR PEERS SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. THANK YOU CENTER BOARD IS OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS AND WHAT CAL SKI RESEARCHER I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT NO THE GENTLEMAN FROM SANTINI AND I ARE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT WERE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY PASSED OUT A BILL THAT WOULD INCLUDE PERMANENT RESIDENTS THAT ARE LEGALLY HERE OUR COUNTRY TO BE INCLUDED IN THE JURY POOL AND THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT TEN PERCENT. OF OUR POPULATION NOW IN CALIFORNIA IT NO FOR ALEC BEST. ABOUT IT BUT THE JURY ABOUT A POOL THAT WE THE COMMUNITY WE LIVE IN I WOULD HOPE THAT FOLKS WITH. WHAT WE VETOED BY GOVERNOR FOR PAPER IT'S IN IDEA WE WANT TO. HERE SO I MOVED THE BILL. THANK YOU KUDOS TO CENTER WHAT CAL CONSIDER. ALL RIGHT- ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO COMMENT- CENTER WHAT COUNTS HE HAS MOVED THE BILL- WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE AND WE- I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ITEM. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND CHIEF COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL. YES THIS IS SENATE BILL TWO SEVENTY ONE BY SENATOR WIENER. WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATION. NUMBER I. UMBERG BY GORGEOUS GORGEOUS I HAVE A ZERO. DEDUCTIBLE GONZALEZ. L. AS SP TWO SEVENTY ONE BY WINNER HI HERTZBERG I JONES JONES I LAYERED WHERE'D I STERN. WHITE HOUSE SKI WHY CASKEY I MEAN- WINNER I. SO FAR YOU HAVE EIGHT ZERO WITH MEMBERS MISSING ALL RIGHT PUT BILL ON CALL OUR LAST AND FINAL BILL IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM'S BILL AB ONE TWO SIX TWO BIT UNUSUAL TO HAVE AN ASSEMBLY BILL BUT WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE A MEMBER OF THE OTHER HOUSE HERE WITH US TODAY. ALL RIGHT. SOME REMEMBER CUTTING HIM THANK YOU MR CHAIR THANK YOU SENATORS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT A B. TWELVE SIXTY TWO AND I WILL START BY THINKING THE CHAIR AND HIS EXCELLENT EXCELLENT STAFF IN PARTICULAR CHRISTIAN FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THEY PUT INTO MAKING THIS A BETTER WORK PRODUCT. AB TWELVE SIXTY TWO SIMPLY PUT WOULD PROHIBIT ANY RECORDINGS OR TRANSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED OR RETAINED THROUGH A VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE. OF A SMART SPEAKER DEVICE FROM BEING SHARED WITH OR SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY. UNLESS THE USER HAS PROVIDED AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. THE BILL CATEGORICALLY EXEMPT STATED THAT IS THE IDENTIFIED AS DEFINED IN THE CCPA. THE POWER INNOVATION OF TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY HAS TRANSFORMED THE LIVES OF NOT ONLY PEOPLE IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY BUT EVERYDAY CONSUMERS OF THESE PRODUCTS. HOWEVER SMART SPEAKERS POSE UNIQUE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER PRIVACY. THESE DEVICES ARE IN OUR HOMES THERE ARE BEDROOMS AND OUR KIDS ROOMS IN THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOMS AND A CAPABLE OF RECORD BOTH RECORDING AND INSTANTLY TRANSMITTING. RECORDINGS AND DATA TO CLOUD SERVERS. THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE CHANGED OUR WORLD FOR THE BETTER THERE IS NO DOUBT AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. BUT THESE NEW SAFEGUARDS THAT THIS BILL WOULD PUT INTO PLACE WOULD ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF THE NEW TECHNLOGY. WHILE PRESERVING IMPORTANT CONSUMER PRIVACY. HOW WE WILL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS MOVING FORWARD PROCESS THAT DO THE FOLLOWING THINGS IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR GROUPS AND INDUSTRY AND THE MANUFACTURERS OF THESE PRODUCTS WITH A THIRD PARTY TO THE EXTENT THAT INFORMATION IS NECESSARY TO EXECUTE A FUNCTION OR PROVIDE A SERVICE SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED BY THE USER. PER PROVIDE USERS WITH AN OPTION TO REVOKE THEIR CONSENT FOR DATA SHARING AN INTERFACE FOR THE DELETION OF RECORDINGS OR TRANSCRIPTIONS AND AN OPTION TO DO SO AUTOMATICALLY. ALLOW MANUFACTURERS TOPROMPT THE USER TO CHANGE YOUR SETTINGS ONCE A MONTH. OR WHEN THE USER ATTEMPTS TO EXECUTE A FUNCTION THAT REQUIRES DATA SHARING. WHICH GIVES INCREASED CONSUMER CHOICE MOVING FORWARD ALSO REMOVE THE PROHIBITION ON FIRST PARTY ADVERTISING. AND MAKE IT SO THAT ONLY SELLING OR SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES WOULD REQUIRE THE AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT FROM THE USER. THAT ALSO ALIGN THE DEFINITIONS OF SELL AND SHARE WITH THE EXISTING DEFINITIONS IN THE CIVIL CODE THAT WAS ADDED BY THE CCPA. AND FINALLY THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ADDRESS THE FALSE WAKE WORD ISSUE BY ALARM COMPANIES TO KEEP RECORDINGS UP TO FIFTEEN SECONDS LONG WHEN REASONABLY NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE DEVICE. AND WITH THAT I'D BE AT MY WITNESS. JUST NOTIFIED US FIVE MINUTES AGO THAT HE HAD A FAMILY MEDICAL EMERGENCY SO HE WILL NOT BE JOINING US BY PHONE. SO TO BE CLEAR- SO NUMBER. THERE ARE NO PRIMARY WITNESS IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT ALL RIGHT. ARM ARE THERE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE AS I SEE. NO ONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IN THE GALLERY ON AB ONE TWO SIX TWO- WHEN THIS IS ON THE PHONE. OR OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE TWO SIX TWO ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE TO SIX TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO APPETITE. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S NOW TURN THE OPPOSITIONIST AND WE HAVE. TO ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION MISTER MOHAMMED FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND MR HOFFMAN FROM TECHNET- THIS ROBERT ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES I AM THE FUTURE OUR PLEASURES. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD HERE TODAY MORNING SHOW UP ON THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND- WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IF YOU DO INTEND TO REGULATE THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SMART SPEAKER MARKET TO CREATE INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE VOTER APPROVED CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT TWENTY TWENTY. CPR A PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE OPT OUT PRIMARK YOU DATA CURRENT LAW ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF THE FILTER DATA UNDER CPR A REGARDLESS OF THE HARDWARE OR PLATFORM NOT BY WHICH THE DATA COLLECTED. HELLO THINK YOU'RE INVITED YOU TO CONSUMER DATA REGARDLESS OF THE DEVICE MAYBE TWELVE TO GET. SMART SPEAKERS ONLY IN INTO DOING IT REVERSES THE PARENTS OPT OUT FRAMEWORK FOR THIS LIKE A HARDWARE IN THIS WAY AT TWELVE SIXTY TWO COULD STILL BENEFIT FROM ON THING- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOICE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF AND HARDWARE WITHIN THAT TECHNOLOGY IS HOUSE. SIMILAR THERE'S ALSO A LACK OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN VOICE RECORDING THEMSELVES IN THE TRANSCRIPTION- THAT THEY RETURNED ATTACKED IN THE BILL- THEY TREAT THEM OUT EFFECTIVELY DEPENDING UPON THE MIDDLE TO THE BACK OF THE PRODUCTSBEING REGULATED HERE HAVE ONLY. ONE FUNCTION. CONSUMERS ARE JUST SPEAKERS ARE ARE UNDER NO. OF WHAT THE- DO. HAVE THE GENERAL DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE. THE CORE FUNCTION OF THE DEVICES IF THE TREE. WITH AND CONSUMERS BY DEFAULT. FOR THE PURPOSE UNDER CURRENT LAW. CONSUMERS ALL ENJOYED FELL OFF OUT OF THE SALE INFO. RIGHT DELETE RIGHT THAT. AND MORE UNDER. AT FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECT OPPOSE THE TWELVE SIX TWO AND ACCORDING. WITH YOU. STOP AS WE- THE PROPOSAL. FROM THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MUHAMMAD FOR OBSERVE THE TIME LIMITS THAT IF WE WERE TO EVER GIVE AN AWARD FOR MOST WORDS WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME. YOU WOULD CERTAINLY BE A CONTENDER THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OF MISS HOUGH MR HOFFMAN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SENATE BILL HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF TECHNIC- WE'RE ALSO RESPECTED BECAUSE THE TWELVE SIXTY TWO WE CAN APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN TO AND ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS. HAVEN'T BEEN BEEN ABLE TO CIRCULATE THE LATEST DIMENSION FOR MEMBERS BUT LOOK FORWARD TO. PROVIDING THAT FEEDBACK- SPEAKING OF THE BILLING PRINT I THINK IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE WITH THE TWELVE SIXTY TWO IS THAT IT KEEPS TRYING TO REINVENT MANY EXPECT PRIVACY PROTECTION- APPROVED BY VOTERS WITH PROPERLY FOR NPR A FROM ONE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY- IT DOES WELL IT AT. TECH MAN. IF YOU TOLD SIXTY TWO SHORT FOR RESPONSE SPEAKER- CAN ARE HAVE A RIGHT KNOW. AND WE THE PERSONAL. POINTS FOR TRANSFER. ADDITIONALLY AT TWELVE SIXTY TWO COMPLEX WITH EXISTING OPT OUT REGIME BURGERS. RIGHT HER CONSUMER STOPPED AND- OFTENTIMES FOR THE DEVICES. THANKS THERE. AS MR MENTIONED IN ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH TRANSCRIPTION RECORD- THIS WAY WE BELIEVE THIS ONE DR AND- THE COMPLEX OF I'M TRYING TO COMPLY THE BILL- AND WHILE THE TRIES TO ADDRESS. ACT ACT BLISSFUL WAKES REQUIRES CONSUMERS TOPPED TO ALLOW COMPANIES TO USE. CAN PRETTY ACCURATELY. HOW WE CAN'T GET WHETHER A WEEK WAS ALL ABOUT RETAINING AN ANALOG- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THIS TECHNICAL ISSUE- IN ORDER TO MATCH. THE VILLAGE THING AFTER STATED INTENT. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE ANY TWELVE SIXTY TWO HERE AT THE VICTIM. CARDS OR CONSPIRATORIAL THE REMAINING ISSUES WITH THE AUTHOR AND OFFICE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR HOFFMAN UP BEFORE WE TURN WELL IT LET'S LET'S TAKE OTHER OPPOSITION- SAYING NO ONE IN THE GALLERY WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. MADAM MODERATOR. IF WE COULD TURN TO THE PHONES. THANK YOU YOU WISH IF IT OUT. TO A ONE TWO SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE IF N. ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO COMMON THINGS Q. IT'LL JUST BE ONE MOMENT FOR THE FIRST COMMENT.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON NUMBERS CHENEY HOP WITH THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M THIRTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MORE WELL BEING OF THE CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BETTER MODEL YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT ALL RIGHT- BEFORE WE TURN TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE FLOOR- THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER CUNNINGHAM I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH OUR STAFF AND WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND I ALSO KNOW YOU TO BE A PERSON OF YOUR WORD AND YOU KEEP YOUR COMMITMENTS BUT JUST TO. REVIEW SOME OF THOSE COMMITMENTS AS THIS BILL MOVES FOR THESE ARE NOT AMENDMENTS BE TAKEN TODAY THESE ARE SIMPLY COMMITMENTS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO. ASSUMING IT IT MOVES OF THIS COMMITTEE TO PREPARATIONS. THAT THE- PROHIBITION. OF WILL BE REMOVED ON USING RECORDINGS AND TRANSCRIPTS FOR ADVERTISING ENTIRELY AND THEREFORE- SUCH USE WOULD NOT REQUIRE AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT FROM THE USER. AND THEREFORE IT'S SUPERSEDES AN AMENDMENT THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED CONCERNING- A- MORE RESTRICTIVE USE OF ADVERTISING IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING. THAT'S CORRECT MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. N. ALSO INSERTS- CERTAIN DEFINITIONS OF SELL AND SHARE THE TRACK WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. YES MISTER CHAIR THAT'S CORRECT WE WANT TOTAL ALIGNMENT BETWEEN EXISTING DEFINITIONS PUT IN THE CODE BY C. C. P. A. IN THE DEFINITIONS THAT ARE. USED HERE FOR SELINGER OKAY AND THEN ALSO ALLOW COMPANIES TO RETAIN RECORDINGS FROM FALSE WEEKS FOR UP TO FIFTEEN SECONDS. THAT'S THE LENGTH OF THE ACTUAL RECORDING- AS IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE- DEVICE IS THAT RIGHT YES MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THAT CAME OUT OF A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS AND MEETINGS OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT SEEMS TO BE. THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE RECORDINGS ANALYZE THEM PUT IN PUT THEM THROUGH. MACHINE LEARNING DIFFERENT DEVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY IS USING A SMART SPEAKER THAT MAY HAVE AN ACCENT OR SPEECH MPAIRMENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN STILL ACCESS THE FEATURES OF THE DEVICE. AND I'M ALSO AWARE THAT THERE THERE'S STILL SOME OTHER ISSUES TO WORK OUT BUT- GIVEN YOUR COMMITMENT I I'M- GOING TO VOTE ALL RIGHT TODAY- OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I SEE SENATOR BORJAS MICROPHONE RACE AND A BOY JUSTIN AND SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU. IT SEEMS LIKE A PRIVACY IS NEVER IN EASY ISSUE TO TACKLE AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR SPEARHEADING THIS EFFORT FIVE WHEN YOU WHEN I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHAT. I HAPPEN TO HAVE AN ALEXA DEVICE I WAS SHARING THIS WITH YOU YESTERDAY. AND IT'S VERY CONVENIENT YEAH I'M IN THE KITCHEN JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE AND I YELL OUT YOU KNOW PLAY THIS TYPE OF MUSIC ALEXA TURNS ON AND PLAYS THE MUSIC. THE PROBLEM THAT I RAN INTO IS THAT MY SON'S NAME IS A LECCO. SO IMAGINE HOW MUCH INTERFERENCE THERE IS IN MY HOUSEHOLD- EVERY TIME I YELL AT MY KID- YOU GIL ACROSS THE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY ALEXIS STALLS OUT REINTERPRETS AND- I NEED TO- CHANGE ALEXIS NAME TO SOMETHING LIKE BARBARA ROOM MARGARET OR SOMETHING TO GET MORE PALATABLE IN OUR HOUSEHOLD- MY FATHER'S NAME. I BRING THIS UP IS BECAUSE. IT'S A LITTLE EERIE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE THESE SPONTANEOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT COME THROUGH- THE SMART SPEAKER PROGRAMMING. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE ON BEFORE BOMB OR ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRICE OF BROCCOLI AND NEXT THING YOUKNOW- THROUGH VARIOUS MEANS YOU FIND OUT THE BROCCOLI'S ON SALE. AT OTHER LOCATIONS. THESE ARE THE THESE ARE THE BY PRODUCTS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND OF COURSE PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES- PROFIT FROM THEM AND THE DATA SHARING THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT- MY FATHER IS ELDERLY. AND ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS DEVICE IS THAT HE CAN YELL INTO THE DEVICE. AND PLACE AN ORDER FOR FOOD OR ASK FOR ADVICE ON SOMETHING OR GET A TELEPHONE NUMBER. PRIVACY IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND THERE IS A PRIVACY DRAWBACK AND THERE'S A BALANCE THERE IN SOMEWHERE IN IT CHANGES ALL THE TIME ON IN ANY GIVEN SCENARIO. THAT'S WHY PRIVACY SUCH A STICKY WICKET- WE'VE SEEN IT IN TWENTY NINETEEN- WHEN WE WERE DEALING WITH ALL THESE LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN JUDICIARY AND ON THE FLOOR AND THEN OF COURSE THERE AFTER PRIVACY IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT. WE SHOULD EMBRACE- AS THE- A LEGISLATIVE SPACE BECAUSE SO MUCH IS CHANGING SO QUICKLY WE NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THE GOOD ACTORS IN THOSE- THAT MAY NOT FIT THAT BILL AS WELL. I BELIEVE THAT- THE AUTHOR HERE IS DOING. A YEOMAN'S JOB OF TRYING TO CREATE A BALANCE THAT LOOKS AFTER. THE INDUSTRY'S NEEDS. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DANCING TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE ALLOWING A. I. TO BECOME AN EVERYDAY COMPONENT OF OUR LIVES. AND LORD KNOWS IF YOU'RE A COMPARISON TO CHINA FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT'S THE FURTHEST REACHES. OF HOW AI IS BEING USED. IN THE MORNING VARIOUS WAYS. WE'RE NOT IN THAT SITUATION WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AFTER. THE- PERCEIVED RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTED RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE IDEAS OF PRIVACY IN THE HOME. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT ACTION I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. KNOWING THAT IT IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. THERE ARE STILL NEGOTIATIONS ARE THAT ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN ON THE FINE TUNING OF ALL THESE ISSUES AND I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE AUTHOR. WE'LL CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK THAT IS DONE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW SOME OF THESE CAN BE RESOLVED MAYBE SOME CAN BE BE SOME CANNOT. BUT I THINK THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WE NEED TO GO THROUGH NORMALLY I DON'T LIKE SUPPORTING BLLS THERE'S THAT STILL HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO. BUT IN THE PRIVACY WRONG I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CHOICE. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY- ON AND LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT. THE CONVERSATIONS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS YIELD DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT THE FINAL PRODUCT CONDOLENCES TO YOUR SON ON BEING RECORDED CHANGES FIRST NAME ALL RIGHT. CENTER WINNER. I FIGURE AS THE CHAIRMAN I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR- WORKING ON A IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY IS VERY POWERFUL AND BRINGS A LOT OF BENEFITS. TO PEOPLE- BUT ALSO HAS POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES AND SUCH DECISIONS TAKE HERE A GOOD FAITH STOP- TRYING TO- AMELIORATE THOSE DOWNSIDES AND I KNOW THAT IT'S ON THE TO WORK IN PROGRESS AND THE ALTAR IS COMMITTED TO SOME GOOD AMENDMENTS SO- HAPPY TO SUPPORT AND I MOVED THE BILL HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN THE CCPA THE C. P. R. A. N. THE LIKE IN THIS IS INDEED A VERY CHALLENGING ISSUE BECAUSE PRIVACY IS I'VE OFTEN SAID USED TO BE A PEEPING TOM LOOKING OVER THE FENCE AND TODAY. WHO KNOWS WHAT IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION THAT FOLKS CAN HAVE AGAINST YOU I WANTED TO RAISE MY MICROPHONE FOR A COUPLE REASONS FIRST. WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING SKETCHES OUT. FOR THE NINE DELICIOUS SPEAKERS IN THIS ROOM THAT'S HIS GUTS CALL ME LIKE CRAZY HE'S BEEN ON IT HE'S BEEN VERY DILIGENT AND I THINK THAT CHALLENGING PROBLEM AND I'M HOPING THAT AS THE- PRIVACY BOARD GETS TOGETHER MORE OF THESE KINDS OF ISSUES ARE OFFLOADED TO THE JURISPRUDENTIAL FRAMEWORK THAT WILL BE CREATED BY THE PRIVACY BOARD. RATHER THAN IN THESE LEGISLATIVE TASKS AND I JUST WANTED TO ECHO WITH THE QUESTIONS AND MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE WITH THE CHAIRMAN SAID CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BACK AND FORTH IN TERMS OF THESE AMENDMENTS. I WASN'T PLANNING ON VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY. AND I DID SO BASED UPON THE FACT THAT I WAS ASSURED THAT THESE AMENDMENTS AS EXPRESSED BY THE CHAIR I DON'T NEED TO REVIEW THEM AGAIN. WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING AN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. AND THE LS I HEARD SOMETHING DIRECTLY INDIRECTLY- SEVEN MEMBER THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT WILL TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS IN APPROPRIATIONS CORRECT ABSOLUTELY OKAY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK APPRECIATE. YOUR YOUR GOOD LEGISLATOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I SUGGEST THAT YOU CLOSE NOW. SEVEN MEMBER CUTTING HIM ON THAT NOTE. I HAD ANYONE ELSE NO OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT. BUT AGAIN I WANNA THANK EVERYBODY FOR WORKING SO HARD TO TRY TO MAKE THIS SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS I THINK HANDLED THE FALSE WAKE WORD ISSUE. SO THAT. YOUR SON IS A CONFUSED FOR ALEXA FOR THE REST OF HIS NON LIFE AS LONG AS YOU KEEP IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD I THINK THAT WE'VE- MOVED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION ON THAT ISSUE I THINK WE DO HAVE IS THE OPPOSITION HIGHLIGHTED SOME ISSUES TO WORK ON. STILL WITH RESPECT TO TRANSCRIPTION VERSES AUDIO RECORDING NOW WE DEFINE CERTAIN THINGS BUT I HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TODAY AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THAT. AND AGAIN YES SENATOR HERTZBERG THANK YOU- I AM COMMITTED TO TAKING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED BY THE CHAIR IN APPROPRIATIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FINE TUNE THIS I THINK WE CAN GET THERE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE WORLD WERE DEVICE AND PUT IT IN THEIR BEDROOM THE KITCHEN INTEGRATE THEIR HOME WITH THESE WONDERFUL SPEAKERS- THAT THEY CAN DO SO. WITH THE FULL CONFIDENCE. THAT THE RECORDINGS ARE GOING TO BE- THE RECORDINGS THAT CAN BE DONE OF THEM WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND NOT TO BE SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES. WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT I THINK.
