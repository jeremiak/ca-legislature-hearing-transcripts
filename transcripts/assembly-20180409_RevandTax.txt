WE'RE GONNA START TODAY'S ROBIN TAX COMMITTEE HEARING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL TO THE COMEDIAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE HAVE THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM BUT WE ARE GOING TO START WITH ITEM NUMBER NINE. AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY TWO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AB ONE THIRD AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY TWO WOULD GIVE. PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION FOR RENTAL HOUSING UNITS DESIGNED FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE SO CALLED MISSING MIDDLE AYE IN HIGH COST PARTS STATE. I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT STATE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS A BILL TO ADDRESS THE PLIGHT OF MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN THE SO CALLED MISSING MIDDLE. POOR IN A TOUGH SPOT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE OF MODERN INCOME UNABLE TO AFFORD MARKET RATE HOUSING BUT WHO EARN TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED. LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AMONG OTHERS THE MISSING MIDDLE INCLUDES TEACHERS FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS HEALTHCARE CHILDCARE OR RETAIL WORKERS WHO ARE ALL CRITICAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES THERE OFTEN COMMUNITY EXHAUSTING HOURS IN GRIDLOCK TRAFFIC EVERY WEEK. FROM THE LOWER COST AREAS TO HIGH COST JOBCENTRE. THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE A PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION TO NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS TO BUILD RENTAL HOUSING FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. DEFINED AS THOSE MAKING BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT AM I. THE SAVINGS FROM THE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION TO NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS WOULD BE USED TO REDUCE RENTS TO MODERATE INCOME LEVELS. DEVELOPERS WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO CHARGE TENANTS THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR RENT. AND IN ADDITION THE RATE OF RED WOULD BE AT LEAST TEN PERCENT BELOW THE FAIR MARKET RENT. AS DETERMINED BY HIDE AND A RENTS ARE ALREADY LOW BECAUSE THEIR SET EVERY FIVE YEARS AND DO NOT REFLECT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS BILL WOULD NOT TAKE AWAY RESOURCES FROM LOWER INCOME UNITS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD RECEIVE FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE ARE AND THE CHAIR FOR SUGGESTING A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. AT THIS TIME ARE UNPREPARED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD LIMIT THE EXEMPTION TO NEW MULTI FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. ALSO THE EXEMPTION THAT WOULD BE LIMITING TO MULTI FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS A WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS. I AND I AM ALSO PREPARED TO ACCEPT AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP TO ENTER INTO WHAT IS KNOWN AS QUOTE. OTHER LEGAL DOCUMENTS TO SELF IMPOSED WENT OCCUPANCY RESTRICTIONS. RATHER THAN MARRYING THE LANGUAGE IN THE EXEMPTION FOR LOW INCOME UNITS. ONE ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS AND I KNOW NOW THAT THERE IS INTEREST AND THINKING ABOUT HOW. THIS BILL MIGHT BE SUNSET ED IN THE LONG HAUL SO THAT THERE IS A LONG TERM LIMITATION ON THE VALUE OF THE EXEMPTION OVER TIME. WE JUST HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AN HOUR AGO A I'M HAPPY TO WORK ON THIS I'M VERY OPEN TO THIS. HOPEFULLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS BUT I DO THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR NEW POLICY. MOVING FORWARD AGAIN TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. AND DEALT WITH THAT. LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR OUR SUPPORTERS AND SPONSORS ARE STARTING FIRST WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM AND MARINA WHITE. THINK YEAR OLD GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARINO WENT CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WE ARE IN A NON PARTISAN ADVOCATE FOR THE PRODUCTION PRESERVATION OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. REPRESENTING THE BUILDING DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ON PUBLIC SECTORS UNITED IN THEIR GOAL THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAVE A SAFE AFFORDABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. LAST YEAR I LEGISLATURE STEPPED UP TO INVEST IN THE TOOLS IN FUNDING. TO START ADDRESSING OUR HOUSING CRISIS BUT THERE'S SO MUCH WORK AHEAD TO KEEP. STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS AND AFFORDABLE HOMES AS MANY OF YOU NOTED OVER THE PAST YEAR THE HOUSING CRISIS IS SO SEVERE THAT MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. ON THE WORKING PROFESSIONALS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO ARE STRUGGLING TO AFFORD HOUSING AND AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY TWO IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF NEW RENTAL HOUSING UNITS. IN HIGH COST AREAS SO THAT OUR SEATS VITAL MISSING METAL CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY WORK. EXISTING PROPERTY ALREADY ALLOWS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR WELFARE EXEMPTION IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING UNITS OCCUPIED FOR A LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY TO CREATE A SIMILAR EXEMPTION FOR RENTAL HOUSING UNITS THAT RESTRICT RENTS A THIRTY PERCENT OF MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THAT IS HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN EIGHTY AND HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT OF THE AREA MEDIAN TIME SO LONG AS THOSE UNITS ARE IN THE HIGH COST COUNTIES AND THE RENTS ARE IS STILL AT LEAST TEN PERCENT BELOW. MARKET RATES IN THE GOAL HERE IS TO ENSURE THAT ANY PROPERTY TAX REDUCTION IS BEING USED TO MAINTAIN THE AFFORDABILITY OF THOSE UNITS. WITHOUT THIS TOOL TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSING UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AT THE MARKET AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. AND GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIR BURKE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS AMY CHAN AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR'S OFFICE OF HOUSING. AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND ON BEHALF OF OUR OFFICE AND WE WANT EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI THIRTY ONE FIFTY TWO AND THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR MODERATE MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES I AM TO STAY IN CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. THEY MAKE UP A VERY DIVERSE SET OF OUR WORK FORCE AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS MENTIONED THEY ARE TEACHERS. ARE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE FIREFIGHTERS AND YET HIGH COST CITIES ARE NOT MEETING THE NEED TO HOUSE MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES BETWEEN EIGHTY TO HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT OF ON THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. IN SAN FRANCISCO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE MARKET IS SERVING REALLY HOUSEHOLDS AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF AND MY AND ABOVE. WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF RENTS ARE AN AVERAGE TWO BEDROOM HAS BEEN AS HIGH AS FORTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH? WEARS A FAMILY OF THREE MAKING EIGHTY PERCENT OF AM I CAN ONLY AFFORD TO PAY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. OR FAMILY OF THREE MAKING HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT OF AM I CAN ONLY AFFORD TO PAY THIRTY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT LEAVES A HUGE AFFORDABLE AFFORDABILITY CAP FOR OUR MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES ON AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES A STEADY DECLINE AND MODERATE INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS ON LEAVING THE CITY AND WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING IS TEACHERS LEAVING OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AT AN ATTRITION THE SAN FRANCISCO IS ACTUALLY INVESTED. EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR MODERATE INCOME PRODUCTION THROUGH A HOUSING ON HOUSING BOND THAT WE PASSED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. BUT THESE FUNDS ARE LIMITED AND I'M WOULD ONLY GENERATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED UNITS TOTAL. AND WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS WE NEED TO HOUSE MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES. ACCORDING TO OUR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT. SO WE ARE IN DIRE NEED OF MORE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THAT MISSING MS THIS MISSING METAL. AND EXPANDING THE WELFARE TAX EXEMPTION TO SERVE THESE HOUSEHOLDS UP TO ONE TWENTY PERCENT EVERY OF AIR IN MEDIAN INCOME WOULD BE A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR US. AND THIS EXEMPTION WANTED INCENTIVIZE GREATER PRODUCTION A MODERATE AND MIDDLE INCOME UNITS BY REDUCING THE OPERATING COSTS FOR THESE UNITS AND IN TURN ALLOWING OUR HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO LEVERAGE MORE REVENUE IS SMALL. AND GIVEN THAT THE EXEMPTION IS ONLY LIMITED TO CERTAIN ELIGIBLE ENTITIES AND ONLY APPLY TO UNITS IN HIGH COST CITIES WHERE THE RENTS AT EIGHTY TO HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT OF AND MY. AND SHOWN TO BE BELOW THE FAIR MARKET RENT. IN COMPARISON WE JUST SEE A TREMENDOUS. PUBLIC BENEFIT IN CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR A MODERATE AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES AND SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THINKING. OTHERS WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION INCLUDING. ITS NEWEST MEMBER AND. AND AND THOSE OF YOU WHO UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES OF THE HOUSING CRISIS WERE AND. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS RIGHT NOW THIS IS HOUSING THAT IS NOT BEING BUILT SO THERE ARE NO PROPERTY TAX REVENUES TO BE COLLECTED. BUT IF WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN EXEMPTION. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS HOUSING THAT COULD BE CREATED TO ADDRESS A VERY SIGNIFICANT. SHORTAGE THAT WE HAVE NOW FACING OUR MIDDLE CLASS AND ARE WORKING FAMILIES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I DO THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ASKED OF US BY THE COMMITTEE WERE WERE REASONABLE. AYE AND.

IF WE TAKE THEM PROJECTS WILL PENCIL OUT AND WE WILL HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT BUT ALSO DO YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE.

AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY TWO TRIES TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT WE SAW. DURING THE WILDFIRE AS SEASON HERE IN IN IN THIS SUCH ISSUE IS. IS RIGHT NOW IN THE CURRENT LAW WHEN YOU. ASK FOR A DIFFERENT TAXES. YOU YOU HAVE TO DO SO BASICALLY. MAKING THE CLAIM THAT YOUR DAMAGE A DURING A NATIONAL DISASTER WAS AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. AND IN SOME CASES A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW THE EXACT EXTENT OF WHAT THEIR DAMAGES AND SO THEY GET PUT INTO A PLACE WHERE. AND IF AND IF YOU MAKE A BAD FAITH CLAIM FOR THIS DEFERRAL YOU CAN YOU COULD FACE PENALTIES. SO PUTS A LOT OF TAXPAYERS IN THE SITUATION WHERE. THEY MAY NOT MAKE THAT CLAIM. OUT OF FEAR THAT THEY COULD BE CONSIDERED NOT GOOD FAITH. AND SO. A WEEK OR OR THEY JUST DON'T APPLY AT ALL. AND WOULD RATHER HAVE PEOPLE APPLYING FOR THESE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'VE BEEN FACE OF THE DEVASTATING DISASTER LIKE WILDFIRE. HAS TO AB THREE THIRTY ONE TWENTY TO ENSURE IS THAT INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS. LIKE THE RECENT WILDFIRES ARE PUT IN THAT POSITION SPECIFICALLY THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT PAYMENT OF PROPERTY TAXES CAN BE DEFERRED. UNTIL THE ASSESSOR HAS DETERMINED A PROPERTY IS NOT ELIGIBLE SO IF ONCE THE ASSESSOR DETERMINES NO THERE'S LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND OR ITS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SOME OTHER REASON. THEN THERE WERE THEY WOULD GIVE NOTICE TO THE TAXPAYER. AND PER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHICH WE ARE TAKING. FROM THE DATE OF THAT MAILING. ON THE. NOTICE THAT THE TAXPAYER WOULD HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO.

THE CLAIMS THAT WERE COMING IN BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY ACROSS THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AS FAR AS I WHEN THEY WERE TWO AND THEN IF IF ITWASN'T EVIDENT REACHED AS. THRESHOLD WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO MAIL TO THEM TO LET THEM KNOW THEY STILL TO PAY THEIR TAXES SO THIS SOLVES THE LONG STANDING PROBLEM THAT WAS BROUGHT INTO SHARP RELIEF. AND THE FALL WITH THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT BURNED IT WAS JUST A MUCH BIGGER. APPLICATION PROCESS THAT THE OUTRAGE TAX LATER SAW THIS YEAR AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT WILL. ON IN THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE IN SOMEONE'S HOME BURNS ON TO THE FUTURE.

SOME PRODUCTS ELIGIBLE FOR AN EXEMPTION OR SOAKER DRIP IRRIGATION HOSES WHETHER BASED IRRIGATION CONTROLLERS AS WELL AS WATERSENSE CERTIFIED PRODUCTS. LIKE SHOWER HEADS LOW FLOW TOILETS AND FAUCET AERATORS. BASED ON INFORMATION FROM THE U. S. EPA WATERSENSE LABELED IRRIGATION CONTROLLER CAN SAVE AN AVERAGE HOME NEARLY EIGHTY EIGHT HUNDRED GALLONS OF WATER ANNUALLY. INSIDE THE HOME REPLACING INEFFICIENT FAUCETS WITH AND AERATORS WITH WATERSENSE LABEL PRODUCTS CAN SAVE ONE HOUSEHOLD SEVEN HUNDRED GALLONS A YEAR. AS I'VE SPENT THE LAST YEAR WORKING ON THE LONG TERM EFFICIENCY BILLS I REALIZE THAT THE STATE ALSO NEEDS TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO CONSUMERS IN ORDER TO MEET OUR GOALS TO MAKE TO MAKING CONSERVATION A WAY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M AWARE THAT THIS BILL MIGHT HAVE AN IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND I'M WILLING TO TAKE LANGUAGE PROPOSED BY THE COUNTIES TO ALSO ENSURE THAT THE LOCAL RATE AND CHAIR OF THE STATE. ARM PORTION REMAINS INTACT. THIS BILL IS BASED ON A TEXAS LAW THAT PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT PROVIDED A MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION FOR THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS. PROVIDING AN ANNUAL SALES AND USE TAX A TAX EXEMPTION FOR A THREE DAY PERIOD WILL CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO IMPLEMENT MORE AFFORDABLE WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

SCOTTS MIRACLE GRO SURVEYED RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY FIFTEEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE DROUGHT AND FOUND THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS WERE WILLING TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CONSERVE WATER.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M EXCITED TO PRESENT YOU TODAY A BILL THAT HAS FOURTEEN CO AUTHORS. AND FOLLOWS SIX OTHER STATES ARE RED AND BLUEMIX OREGON MONTANA LOUISIANA ALABAMA MISSOURI AND IOWA. IN SENSIBLY REFORMING OUR TAX CODE. NOW TAX REFORM IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NOTORIOUSLY INTRACTABLE ISSUE. BUT RECENT EVENTS HAVE PRESENTED A RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS. AS YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR'S FEDERAL TAX REFORM BILL CAPPED THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. COMMONLY KNOWN AS SALT. MANY OF OUR STATE LEADING ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. FOR EXAMPLE FORMER SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM KEVIN DE LEóN HAS STATED THAT HAPPENED THE SALT DEDUCTION AMOUNTS TO QUOTE DOUBLE TAXATION. HE ADDED THAT THE LOSS OF THE SALT DEDUCTION HURTS CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND HURTS THE MIDDLE CLASS. IN ADDRESSING THE LOSS OF HIS BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS GOVERNOR BROWN IS CALLED THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION A MONSTROSITY AND EVIL IN THE EXTREME. CONSEQUENTLY SENATOR DELEON HAS DESCRIBED THE NEED TO QUOTE MAKE TAXPAYERS HOLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IS FULLY WITHIN OUR POWER AS THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO DO JUST THAT. TODAY'S BILL ANSWER SENATOR W. OWNS CALL TO MAKE TAXPAYERS HOLE BY RESTORING IT THE FULL BENEFIT. OF THE SALT DEDUCTION FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. TO RESTORE THE FULL BENEFIT OF SALT. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS TO DEDUCT THEIR FULL FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY ON THEIR STATE TAX WHICH. JUST LIKE SALT JUST THE OTHER WAY AROUND. NOW MATHEMATICALLY THIS IS THE SAME AS SALT FOR THE TAXPAYER. DEDUCTING FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON A STATE RETURN LEAVES THE TAXPAYER IN THE SAME POSITION AS DEDUCTING STATE INCOME TAXES. ON A FEDERAL TAX RETURN. WHAT CALLING IT THE NEW DEDUCTION THE PEPPER DEDUCTION? IT WOULDN'T SENATOR W. OWNS WORDS MAKE TAXPAYERS HOLE AND BENEFIT MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WELL ELIMINATING ANY CONCERNS. ABOUT DOUBLE TAXATION. BUT THERE'S MORE. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR WILL ALSO BRING A MUCH NEEDED DOSE OF STABILITY. THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET. THE NONPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS REPEATEDLY SOUNDED THE ALARM ABOUT THE WILD VOLATILITY OF STATE REVENUES WHICH ARE AT THE MERCY OF THE STOCK MARKET. AND ONE OFF EVENTS. GOVERNOR BROWN RAISE THE SAME CONCERN IN DISCUSSING THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SAYING CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY VOLATILE TAX SYSTEM. IT MEANS THAT MONEY COMES IN VERY GENEROUSLY AND BUT WE ONLY BUT IT GOES OUT THE SAME WAY. MY PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE VOLATILITY FORTIFYING STATE FINANCES AGAINST THE INEVITABLE NEXT RECESSION. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF TAXPAYERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE IS SHAUN WORSE WITH THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FROM LEWIS OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN SUPPORT AS AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR WOULD BRING MUCH NEEDED TAX RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND WORKING FAMILIES IN THIS VERY HIGH TAX STATE. AS THE AUTHOR ALREADY VERY ACCURATELY COUNTED. IT'S NO SECRET THAT WE ARE IN THE HIGHEST TAXED STATE IN THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX THE HIGHEST INCOME TAXES THE HIGHEST STATE SALES TAX AND ONE OF THE HIGHEST. GAS TAXES IN THE NATION IT'S NO SECRET OR NO SURPRISE THAT ARE. BUSINESS TAX CLIMATE INDEX HOW RINK DOES AT FORTY EIGHT OUT OF FIFTY JUST LAST YEAR. SO JUST LAST YEAR THOUGH. NFIB DID STRONGLY SUPPORT FEDERAL TAX REFORM ON THAT WE GOT LAST YEAR AND THOUSANDS OF OUR MEMBERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND MILLIONS OF OTHER SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE BENEFITTING. FROM TAX REFORM A READY. BUT PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA HAVE VERY HIGH STATE TAXES ARE BUSINESS OWNERS ARE STILL STRUGGLING. SO STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH HIGH STATE TAXES. HAD A NUMBER OF OPTIONS TO CONSIDER WHEN THE SALT DEDUCTION WAS CAPPED AT TEN THOUSAND. A SIMPLE SOLUTION WE WOULD LOVE AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE IS THE SYMBOL REDUCTION OF STATE TAXES ANDWE DO SUPPORT THOSE MEASURES AS WELL. BUT WE KNOW THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE SO AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES ANOTHER VERY GREAT OPTIONS PROVIDE THAT KIND OF RELIEF BY ALLOWING TAXPAYERS TO FULLY DEDUCT THEIR FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY. ON THEIR STATE TAXES SULTAN RIVERS TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND HOPE FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL. AND. MATTERS BUT ALSO JOINING ME IS DAVID WOLF WITH THAT HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WILL FOOT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND AS MISTER WERE SAD I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WITH THE HAVE FEDERAL TAX REFORM PASSING LAST YEAR. YOU KNOW THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THIS COULD OBVIOUSLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT HIGH INCOME EARNERS AND I DO THINK THAT IS THE REASON AND THE RATIONALE. BEHIND THIS BILL. EN EVEN AS MR ALWAYS MENTIONED I THINK IN A PERFECT WORLD RATHER YOU KNOW THAN THIS BILL OR EVEN IN ADDITION TO THIS SPELL. COMING UP WITH LOWER TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD TO OFFSET CALIFORNIA'S EXTREMELY HIGH INCOME TAXES VERY PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAX SCHEDULE. EIGHT BRACKETS MEMBERS. IN CALIFORNIA REGARDING OUR INCOME TAX FAR AND AWAY MORE BRACKETS THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION OBVIOUSLY HIGHEST INCOME TAXES IN THE NATION. THAT IS REALLY THE ULTIMATE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM IS CREATE A FIGHT TAX SYSTEM CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EQUITABLE. FOR TAXPAYERS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILL YOU KNOW BEGINS THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT WERE ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT OF IT THINKING. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DARKER. MY GOOD FRIEND. YOU KNOW WHAT I. LOOK AT TWENTY SEVEN BILLION IS A LOT TO LOSE. I THINK THIS IS. DEFINITELY GOING TO GO INTO APPROPRIATIONS. THE PROBLEM WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS THERE ARE XPENSES ARE VERY HIGH WE HAVE A LOT OF KIDS AS RESULT. EVEN THOUGH WE GIVE MORE STATE MONEY TO SCHOOLS THEN IN TERMS PERCENT OF THE BUDGET FORTY PERCENT TO K. TWELVE. ANOTHER TEN PERCENT TO HIGHER EDUCATION. ARE WE STILL DO NOT FIND A HIGHER EDUCATION AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. AND WERE AMONG THE LOWEST IN PER CHILD. AND SO IT YOU KNOW THAT TWENTY SEVEN BILLION BASICALLY HALF WOULD COME OUT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND K. TWELVE. I'M WONDERING IF YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AT AS PART OF THE SPELL TO COME UP WITH THE REPLACEMENT FOR THE MONEY WE'RE LOSING. WELL I I THINK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION NOW DOCTOR CLERK I WILL JUST A BRIEF CORRECTION SO TWENTY SEVEN BILLION THAT IS OUT AND EIGHTEEN MONTH PER PROJECTIONS SO I AN ANNUALIZED. LEVEL REVENUE LOSS WOULD BE MORE ON THE ORDER OF EIGHTEEN BILLION AT LEAST INITIALLY WHICH MIGHT SOUND LIKE A LOT. BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY. WOULD ONLY BRING US BACK ABOUT TWO YEARS TO WHAT THE STATE BUDGET WAS TWO YEARS AGO. AND SO. I THINK A PRETTY GOOD METHODOLOGY. FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT WOULD BE TO LET'S LOOK AT. WHAT THE MAIN COST DRIVERS HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN? FIRST TOOK OFFICE I THINK THE BUDGET'S GONE SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SINCE THEN. AND LET'S LOOK AT TACK ON A WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN IN RETURN FOR THAT SPENDING OUR THEIR MEASURABLE. IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS AND HERDS OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HEARD OF EDUCATION OUTCOMES. IN TERMS OF THAT AT YOU KNOW INCOME LEVEL OR PURCHASING POWER AND WE DON'T SEE ANY IMMEASURABLE. IMPROVE AND OUT COMES A LINK TO THE INCREASE SPENDING. THEN WE CAN REMOVE THAT SPENDING AND I THINK TO BE VERY EASY TO ACTUALLY I GO BACK JUST TO AGAIN WHERE WE WERE AT. AYE TWO YEARS AGO NOW I WILL SAY THAT IF YOU KNOW COSTS ARE CONCERNED HAS YOU. ACCURATELY NOTE THIS WILL HAVE MORE HURDLES TO GO THROUGH IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND OF COURSE ALL THIS CAN BE NEGOTIATED US SO I THINK YOU CAN CONSIDER TODAY'S BELL. I SIMPLY A VOTE TO ENDORSE THE PRINCIPLE I THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DEDUCTIBILITY WHICH I THINK BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. SEEM TO AGREE ON THAT I YOU KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE SAME ARE YOUR TOTAL INCOME SHOULDN'T BE. ASSEMBLY. MISTER KILEY THIS WAS IN FACT ADOPTED ORIGINALLY TO PROTECT STATES RIGHTS THEIR ABILITY TO. ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES AND I DON'T. JUST JUST SEEMS A CONTRARY TO THAT I'D I'D BE CURIOUS TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE BATES RIGHT SINGLE ARE CONCERNED ACTUALLY THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF FEDERALISM IS THAT SOME STATES ARE LIKE THE ONES I LISTED OUT WERE AGAIN MONTANA LOUISIANA ALABAMA MISSOURI. AND IOWA DO IN FACT HAVE. THE TAX POLICY THAT I'M PROPOSING AND I AND OTHERS DON'T AND IT'S WITHIN THE THE POWER OF EACH STATE TO DECIDE THEIR APPROACH AND I'M SAYING THAT WE SHOULD JOIN THESE OTHER STATES IN ANDTAKING THE APPROACH OF ALLOWING. FEDERAL TAXES TO BE DEDUCTIBLE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS WITH ME. SEEING NO ONE JULY TO CLOSE. OUT. I WE WE HAVE A QUORUM WE'RE GONNA HOLD CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. CLERK IT'S SHOULD PAT OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM. AT THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES BOTTOM ROW THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER FOUND ASTHMA MENTION CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST INCOME TAXES IN THE COUNTRY. AND YET WE ALSO HAVE MORE OF OUR CITIZENS LIVING IN POVERTY THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING IN ONE OF THE LOWEST PERFORMING STATE GOVERNMENTS BY JUST ABOUT ANY METRIC. WORST OF ALL WE SEE MORE AND MORE OF OUR PEOPLE ACROSS ALL INCOME LEVELS LEAVING FOR OTHER STATES BECAUSE ADULT DOESN'T MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE TO LIVE HERE. OR BECAUSE THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO. FEDERAL TAX REFORM IS PRESENTED CALIFORNIA WITH A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. AND WE SHOULDN'T WASTE IT ON THE SAME GIMMICKS AND CAN KICKING DECLINE TO THE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES. INSTEAD WE SHOULD SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH A BLUEPRINT FOR FISCAL STABILITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT WILL RENEW THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. SO AYE AND THAT THE AS CHAIR I HAVE A NO RECOMMENDATION ON THIS EIGHT. I UNDERSTAND YOUR NEED FOR STABILITY I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT CREATING STABILITY THE WAY TO START WITHOUT IS TO BUY BY BLOWING A TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR HOLE INTO OUR GENERAL FUND. I ALSO DON'T THINK THE CREATING STABILITY IS BY ASKING FOR A CALIFORNIA GENERAL FUND TO BORE THE BRUNT OF. WHAT OTHER PROPOSALS DO NOT REQUIRE? WITH THAT IN MIND I MEAN IT'S A CUTE NAME PEPPERS ADORABLE BUT. AS FAR AS TAX REFORM BILLS GO AS FAR AS TAX FROM BILLS GO I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE AN ANALYSIS THAT SHOWS EXACTLY WHO WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE NEW TAX REFORM POLICIES. IN UNTIL YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE TO TAKE OF TO BITE OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND AT THE TO THE TUNE OF TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. I FULLY AGREE SAW DEDUCTION LIMITS IT SOMETIMES WILL HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED BUT WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE WE DO IT. WITH THAT THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL SECOND.

APPLE IS OUT OF. WE'RE GONNA FILE ITEM EIGHT AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN MR ACOSTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO WELL. WHAT I MEAN? THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF. THE EMPLOYMENT RATE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IS WELL OVER EIGHTY PERCENT. MOST EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS POPULATION CAME THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFITS THAT SEEK EMPLOYMENT AND CORDONS WITH THE CONSUMERS INDIVIDUALIZED. PROGRAM PLAN HAS ESTABLISHED WITH AN ASSIGNED REGIONAL CENTER. CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK LETTERMAN ACT AND ENTITLES PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO SERVICES INCLUDING HELP IN FINDING AND KEEPING EMPLOYMENT. SUPPORTED BY THE STATE PERSONS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES RECEIVE VARIOUS SUPPORTS INCLUDING JOB COACHING. WHILE EMPLOYERS PAY THEIR WAGES. IN ADDITION UNDER THE FEDERAL LABOR STANDARDS ACT OR FLSA PERSONS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MAY BE PAID LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. IF THEY'RE EARNING OUR PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY IS IMPAIRED BY A DISABILITY MOVE THE BILL. UNDER A FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATE PRODUCTIVITY MUST BE MEASURED EVERY SIX MONTHS WITH AND WAGES ADJUSTED USING THE PREVAILING WAGE FOR THE JOB IS A STANDARD. AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN WOULD CREATE AN OFFSET OR CREDIT BETWEEN THE MINIMUM WAGE AND WHAT THE PERSON WE PAID USING FSL A PRODUCTIVITY MEASUREMENTS. THROUGH YOU BASED PROGRAMS WILL PROVIDE SUPPORTS INCLUDING PRODUCTIVITY MEASUREMENTS THAT WOULD SERVE AS THE BASIS OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT ALLOWED FOR THE EMPLOYER AND CONTINUE TO MEASURE THE EMPLOYEES. DOUG GROWTH IN JOB RELATED TASKS. AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN. YOU SEEM. AB THIRTY ONE TO TWENTY SEVEN STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN ALLEVIATING THE HIGH RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND NOT OVER BURDENING THE EMPLOYER WITHOUT OF EXPENSES. THIS BILL CREATES ANOTHER EMPLOYMENT OPTION THAT DOESN'T PLACE CONSUMERS IN THE POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN A SUB MINIMUM WAGE JOB. OR NO JOB AT ALL. I HAVE CARL LONDON WITH ME TODAY REPRESENTING THE SPONSOR THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I MEAN THIS ISN'T SUPPORT. DAPHNE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. CARL LONDON HERE ON THE HEALTH ALLIANCE SPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WHEN I THINK A FOR SOFT MR ACOSTA FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE. FORWARD. AS HE SAID THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR PEOPLE IN THIS POPULATION IS WELL OVER EIGHTY PERCENT I. I WAS THINK ABOUT THIS IN ANOTHER CONTEXT WHICH IS IF WE COULD THINK OF ANY OTHER. POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAD THAT KIND OF UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WHAT WOULD WE DO AND. THE FIRST THING IS PUBLIC DOMAIN THIS BILL IN THE PROBABLY BLOW RIGHT OFF. WE HAVE SOME KIND OF RESPONSE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE PASSED A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH CALL FOR EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY FOR THIS POPULATION IN OTHER WORDS THE VERY FIRST THING THAT WE LOOK AT. FOR ANYBODY IN IS POPULATION IS A JOB IN TRYING TO HELP THEM GET TO WORK YET WE STILL HAVE THAT EIGHTY PERCENT. OF PLUS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. THERE IS SOME CONTROVERSY AROUND. THE USE OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE FOR THIS POPULATION. AS THE SORT OF PHILOSOPHICAL DIVIDE GOING ON RIGHT NOW AMONG PEOPLE THAT SERVE THIS POPULATION SOME BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT ALL. OTHERS HAVE SEEN VERY CORRECTLY I THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP SOME PEOPLE GET INTO THE. WORKFORCE AND AT THE SAME TIME. GIVES EMPLOYERS. THE VALUE THEY NEED WHEN THEY'RE SORT OF AYE WAITING THERE BOTTOM LINE THIS BILL KIND OF MARY'S. BOTH CONCEPTS VERY CAREFULLY. BY BASICALLY SAYING THAT ALL YEAR LONG IF AN EMPLOYER DECIDES TO PAY A PERSON WHO WAS ELIGIBLE FOR SUB MINIMUM WAGE. AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE THEY COULD ENJOY AT THE END OF THE YEAR A TAX CREDIT FOR PUTTING THAT PERSON WORK. WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING ABOUT THE FEDERAL LAW AND FOURTEEN SEE IS THAT. PEOPLE EMPLOYED UNDER THE US GET REEVALUATED EVERY SIX MONTHS MOST OF US YOU GUYS EVER. I GUESS IN EVERY TO YOUR REVIEW BY YOUR VOTERS MOST PEOPLE HAVE AN ANNUAL REVIEW WITH A LOOK AT BY THEIR EMPLOYER WE LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THEY DID A GOOD JOB. YOU KNOW WHAT DOT. DESPITE RELATION GETS IN EVERY SIX MONTHS MANDATORY REVIEW SO. IF THEY'RE FOUND DURING THAT TIME TO GET BETTER AT THEIR JOB. THEN THEIR WAGE GOES UP UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW MEETING THIS TAX CREDIT WOULD GO DOWN. SO WHICH IS IDEAL. THE COUPLE THINGS WE'VE DONE HERE WE'VE SUNSET AT THIS TO REQUIRE THAT ONLY GOES FOR A TIME LIMITED PERIOD. AND THEN REQUIRES A REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE SO WE CAN SEE HOW WELL THIS WORK. I CONTINUE FIRSTHAND WE HAVE TALKED TO MANY EMPLOYER GROUPS THE RESTAURANTS. THE GROCER'S CAL CHAMBER. ARE ALL LIKE THIS CONCEPT. IT'S EASY FOR THEM AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO GET OUR POPULATION WORKING WITH THEM BUT THE SUPPORTS THAT MR ACOSTA DESCRIBED. IN ELECTORATE DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THINK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SPORT. TRUTH ANDERSON WITH ARKIN UCP CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON VERY JUTTING FROM THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEN ON QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE DUCK CREEK. ARM. SO MY CONCERN IS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONCE THE PROGRAM GETS STARTED. AND ESSENTIALLY WHY WOULDN'T A GROCER. GIVE THE PERSON THE FULL MINIMUM WAGE WHEN THE STATE'S PAYING A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE DIFFERENCE. I WOULD THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED. AND YOU GET TO THAT TEN MILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE. MY CONCERN THOUGH IS THAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS. AS WAS BROUGHT UP BY YOUR SUPPORTER. IS THE. EIGHTY PERCENT. AND SO FAR AS I CAN SEE THIS DOES NOTHING FOR THE EIGHTY PERCENT WHO ARE EMPLOYED IT GIVES MORE MONEY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE THAT'S IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT. I. I APOLOGIZE BUT. THAT'S THAT IS MY VIEWPOINT. WELL I APPRECIATE THE THE THE COMMENTARY THERE I THINK WHAT WE'VE HEARD AND I LET MY OF THE SPONSOR ACTUALLY RESPOND AS WELL IF IF THAT THE CHAIRS INDULGENCE BUT. VERY BRIEFLY OF WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM A COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS IS THAT. THEY WOULD LIKE TO HIRE EITHER A MORE OR BE ANYONE FROM THIS COMMUNITY IF THEY CAN GET THE PENCIL OUT AND GIVEN THE SITUATIONS WHERE. WE HAVE CHALLENGES. WITH EMPLOYMENT IN THIS AREA ARENA EIGHTY PERCENT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE THE TWENTY PERCENT YOUR CONCERN IS A TWENTY PERCENT GETTING MORE MONEY. BUT THEY'RE THERE THIS IS STILL A RELATIVELY SMALL POPULATION SO THE EIGHTY PERCENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE VERY EASILY ADDRESSED FROM WHAT I'M SEEING OUT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL EMPLOYERS IN AND NOW MY DISTRICT THAT HIGHER ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY THIS POPULATION. SO IT'S NOT SO SO MUCH DIRECTED IN THEIR DIRECTION IT'S MORE DIRECTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RESTAURANTS THE GROCERS THE OTHER FOLKS THAT COULD. THAT COULD GET THESE FOLKS SAN AND HAVE A PENCIL OUT AND THEN BE ABLE TO GET THEM TO A POINT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE LEANING LESS ON SOCIETY AND MORE ON THEM. FOR THE EMPLOYER TO MAKE THAT LEAP OF FAITH AND NOT EVERYBODY WOULD LOVE EVERYONE FRANKLY TO MAKE THAT LEAP OF FAITH. THE UNKNOWN OFTENTIMES WE FOR THAT IN THIS BUILDING IN AND AND ON THE FLOOR OF OUR CHAMBER. AND THE FEAR THE UNKNOWN SOMETIMES CAN BE A STE A ROADBLOCK AND HINDRANCE FOR THE EMPLOYER AND IF WE CAN TAKE AWAY ONE MORE BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR THIS EIGHTY PERCENT OF THIS POPULATION. HEADING IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT'S GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND AS HE SAID AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED AND I'M STEALING CENTER PROBABLY. THAT IS AS AS THE POPULATION ARE THE EMPLOYEES. GAINS MORE SKILL AND IS BETTER MORE PROFICIENT AT THEIR JOB EVERY SIX MONTHS THEY'RE GOING TO BE. WE A RE RE EVALUATED AND AND HOPEFULLY AND POTENTIALLY THE GOAL AS IS THEN TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE ON THE JOB. AND AND DECREASE THE INCENTIVE BUT I I I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. SUMMER QUIRK AND NINETY IN RESPECTFULLY HOPE THAT MAYBE MY. MY SO THE SPONSOR HERE WILL LEVEL CHANGE MINE BUT THAT HE WOULD NOT ADDRESSING THAT. WIENER. MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY UM MISTER GORE QUE SO. JUSTIN DEBATE THIS A LITTLE BIT OF WE PASSED COUPLE YEARS AGO ON THE BUDGET THAT THING CALLED. COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE. PUMPED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWO OUT OF THE STATE BUDGET INTO FINDING JOBS AS POPULATION WHERE IN THE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SUBSIDIZE THE JOBS WITHOUT MODEL. YOU GUYS ALL AGREED IN THE BUDGET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SUBSIDIZE IN THIS CASE WE GO OUT TO IN THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYERS. AND WE SAY TO THEM LOOK WE KNOW YOU HAVE A PERSON UNDER FEDERAL LAW YOU COULD PAY LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. BUT IF YOU AGREED TO GO AHEAD AND AT LEAST PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH HELPS THAT PERSON AS A CONSUMER AND APPROACH SPADE IN THE MARKET. AND THE ECONOMY IF YOU'LL LEAST DO THAT. WILL HELP YOU WITH A TAX CREDIT TO OFFSET THE SORT OF PRODUCTIVITY LOSS YOU'RE PROBABLY GETTING OUT OF THAT. AND AGAIN AS WAS SAID THE PERSON WILL GET BETTER AT THAT JOB WHICH MEANS THE TAX CREDIT WILL GO DOWN GIVING WE'VE DONE HERE. LOOK AT IT AS A PILOT PROJECT IT'S IT'S GOTTA LIMITATION ON TIME IT WON'T BE REAUTHORIZED UNLESS THIS WORKS AND WILL SHOW VERY CLEARLY THAT PEOPLE GOT JOBS THIS WAY. BUT YOU HAVE A MODEL THAT THEY WERE YOU HUNDRED PERCENT SUBSIDY AS THIS ONE SAYS. WILL HELP THE EMPLOYERS HAVE THEY SUBSIDIZE. A DECENT PORTION OF IT ALL YEAR LONG BEFORE THEY GET ANY KIND OF CREDIT. WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANCE WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM EMPLOYERS THE COMMUNITY RIGHT AND THE PER ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT NO ONE NOW HAS AN INCENTIVE TO GIVE. SOMEONE A MERIT RAISE BECAUSE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM THE STATE. AND THERE'S JUST NO I CAN SEE NO WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE HIRING MORE PEOPLE I WOULD SPEND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE THIS TEN MILLION DOLLARS I DON'T THINK DOES THAT. AND I WILL REVIEW TO THE CHAREST AYE I THINK I'VE SAID ENOUGH. AND I QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE. I'M. GOOD ME VERY TOUCHED ON IT BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. THIS IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT. IT TO HIRE THESE THE SOME FOLKS AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO FOR THIS POPULATION. TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE BUDGET IS NOT. SOME TRIVIAL AMOUNT ON A FRANKLY WELL FOR ITS A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S ALSO. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THAT'S I REQUEST SOLELY ACT ASK YOUR I THINK YOU. AND I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR I DO I UNDERSTAND ART RECORDS CONCERNS HOWEVER IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT WE NEED ANY TOOLS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EMPLOY. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SO IMMEDIATE IF THIS GETS PEOPLE OVER THE HUMP LIKE YOU SAID A LEAP OF FAITH WHATEVER WE CAN DO DO THAT IS IMPORTANT AND. AND IT'S GREAT THAT WE ALL HAVE IDEAS ON. OTHER WAYS TO DO THAT AS WELL AND HOPEFULLY THEY COME THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE WITH THAT. ERICA'S DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WITH THAT. THE COLOR OF. MOTION IS TO POUNCE TO APPROPRIATIONS BURKE. BURKE EYEBROW. ROLE AYE BONTA. CHU GRAY. GRAY AYE MCCARTY. MELENDEZ MULLIN. MULLIN AYE QUIRK. NOT VOTING WORK NOT VOTING VOEPEL.

EXEMPTION UNDER CURRENT THE UNDER EXISTING LAW PARCEL TAXES ARE ASSESSED ON INDIVIDUAL PARCELS OF PROPERTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY EXEMPT SENIORS AND SEVERELY DISABLED HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE TYPICALLY ON FIXED INCOME. FROM PAYING PARCEL TAXES UNFORTUNATELY MANY SENIORS IN SEVERELY DISABLED HOMEOWNERS ARE UNABLE TO FIND THE INFORMATION AND HOW TO APPLY FOR PARCEL TAX EXEMPTION. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO CONSISTENT OH UNIFORM PRACTICE IN PLACE LEAVING SENIORS AND SEVERELY DISABLED HOMEOWNERS FRUSTRATED THAT THEY COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXEMPTION THAT IS OFFERED THEM. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS TO ADDRESS THIS OVERSIGHT AND AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY EIGHT REQUIRES COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR'S TO POST ONLINE INFORMATION ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICT PARCEL TAX EXEMPTIONS AVAILABLE TO SENIOR AND DISABLED TAXPAYERS? AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY EIGHT ALSO REQUIRES THE WEB ADDRESS OF THE TAX COLLECTORS HOMEPAGE TO APPEAR ON THE PROPERTY TAX BILL WHICH IF ASSESS LINKS TO INFORMATION ON HOW TO APPLY. FOR PARCEL TAX EXEMPTION. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY EIGHT ONLY APPLIES TO COUNTIES WOULD SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THAT BOTH IMPOSE PARCEL TAXES AND OFFER AN EXEMPTION FROM THOSE PARCEL TAXES. I'M PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH SPECIFY THAT THE EXEMPTION INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE TAX COLLECTOR BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PROVIDE A ONE YOU DELAYED EFFECTIVE DATE TO HELP FACILITATE COMPLIANCE.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THEY NEED TO SERVICE WITH THAT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO PUT ON THE WEBSITE THAT'S A REALLY CRITICAL LINK FOR US OTHERWISE WE DON'T HAVE ANY. AYE INFORMATION THE OTHER THING WE WOULD OBSERVE IS THAT THE TAX ROLLS CLOSE OUT ON JULY ONE. AND SO WILL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MAKE SURE THAT TAXPAYERS UNDERSTAND% THAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED TIMELY. EVEN THOUGH THE TAX BILL COMES OUT IN OCTOBER IN ISN'T DUE UNTIL DECEMBER FOLKS THAT SEND IT IN AN AUGUST MIGHT NOT BE VERY HAPPY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE NOT EXEMPT FOR THAT YEAR AND THERE'S NOTHING REQUIRING US TO.

HE HAS EXPERIENCE AS A FOUNDER OF FOUR DIFFERENT COMPANIES HE'S REYES A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. I AN EASEL CAPITAL WHICH IS THAT THE BASISOF THIS LEGISLATION AND HE'S REYES APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN VENTURE CAPITAL. IN ADDITION TO SERVING AS A C. E. O. HE'S ALSO AN ANGEL INVESTOR WITH INVESTMENT ACTIVITY IN TWENTY PLUS COME COMPANIES. I HE'S ALSO THE OTHER VICE CHAIR OF THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP WHICH IS THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY.

A JAMES BELIEVE US THIS ASSEMBLY BILL IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO STIMULATE MORE START UP CAPITAL ESPECIALLY AMONG DIVERSE TEAMS IN FOUNDERS WERE COMMITTED TO INNOVATION AND JOB CREATION.

MY CONCERN IS YOUR CALLING THESE ANGEL INVESTORS THERE'S ONE OTHER PART OF AN ANGEL INVESTOR AND I DON'T THINK IS DISCUSSED. WHEN THE BELL LOW MAYBE I'VE MISSED SOMETHING WHICH IS. GENERALLY SPEAKING IT IS THOUGHT THAT ANGEL INVESTORS ARE TAKING ANY KIND OF MONEY OUT OF THE COMPANY. AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THEM IS THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR MINIMUM AND I ACTUALLY HAD THE BILL. WHICH. I BASICALLY COULDN'T GET A GOOD DEFINITION FOR SO IT WAS. JOINTLY WITH THE ALLEN WHICH WOULD HAVE SAID FOR AN ANGEL INVESTOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THAT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO ANYWAY MY CONCERN HERE IS PERHAPS YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT FROM ANGEL INVESTOR TO SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE. COULD IF I'M UNLESS I'M READING THE BILL WRONG WHICH I MIGHT BE. THESE PEOPLE COULD BE MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THEIR INVESTMENT. AND. AND I THINK THAT OUR HOPE IS THAT THEY'RE MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY I IN IN THEIR INVESTMENT AT SOME POINT I THINK OUR REAL CONCERN HERE IS THAT AND WE WILL. CHECK AND SEE IF ANGEL INVESTOR IS THE PROPER TERM TO BE USED HOWEVER I BELIEVE IT IS. BUT. AS ARE REPORT SHOW AS THAT. MY NAM OUR OWN BUSINESSES ARE GETTING TWENTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HOURS COMPARED TO MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES ARE GETTING NINETY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM SECURE CAPITAL. AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO DO HERE IS MAKE SWORE THAT UNDERREPRESENTED. AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE PRIORITIZED AND SECURE FINANCING AND SO IF ANGEL MASTER IS NOT THE CORRECT TERM I WILL MAKE SURE WE FIND THE CORRECT TERM BUT I BELIEVE IT IS. TO SHOW MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. SEEING NONE OF THERE WAS A MOTION BY MISTER VOEPEL SECOND BY. MISTER GRAY MADAM CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECT LOW ACTUALLY YEAH CAO PRE RECEIVES FIFTY THREE.
