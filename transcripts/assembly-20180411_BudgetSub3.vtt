WHETHER WE HAVE TO.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.879 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE ASSETS TO BE USED

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.080 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY BY AMTRAK AND THAT'S

00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:23.149 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.251 region:rollup2
ANALYZING IN REAL TIME AND I'D

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:25.784 region:rollup2
INDICATED A PRIOR HEARING WOULD

00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:28.087 region:rollup2
BE REPORTING BACK TO THE

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:30.589 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. AT OUR PROJECT

00:21:28.087 --> 00:21:33.025 region:rollup2
UPDATE REPORT IN MARCH.

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:35.594 region:rollup2
WHAT?

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:38.063 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE IN THE. PLAN.

00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:40.833 region:rollup2
IN DESCRIBING.

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:42.201 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED YET THAT IT INITIAL

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:44.603 region:rollup2
OPERATING SEGMENT.

00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:45.905 region:rollup2
HAS CHANGED IT THAT THE LANGUAGE

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:47.339 region:rollup2
TO DESCRIBE IT USED TO BE HIGH

00:21:45.905 --> 00:21:49.074 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL.

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:51.243 region:rollup2
THIS BUSINESS PLAN DESCRIBED IT

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:52.812 region:rollup2
AS HIGH SPEED RAIL READY.

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:55.347 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:57.783 region:rollup2
THE TWO WELL ULTIMATELY THE.

00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:59.151 region:rollup2
WE WILL HAVE A A SYSTEM THAT IS

00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:00.519 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY A HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.987 region:rollup2
SYSTEM CONNECTING BAKERSFIELD

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:03.956 region:rollup2
AND SAN FRANCISCO.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:05.591 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE INDICATED IN THE PLAN

00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:07.159 region:rollup2
AND IN PRIOR HEARINGS OF WE

00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:09.361 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE FULL FUNDING FOR

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:10.329 region:rollup2
THAT AT THIS TIME SO SIMILAR TO

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.997 region:rollup2
WHAT DID THIS PROJECT IS NEVER

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:13.632 region:rollup2
HAD FULL FUNDING.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:16.202 region:rollup2
OF FOR ALL OF ITS.

00:22:13.632 --> 00:22:17.970 region:rollup2
OUR OPERATIONS AND SO WE ARE

00:22:16.202 --> 00:22:20.372 region:rollup2
PROPOSING TO BUT BUILT IT

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.774 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL STAGES THE FIRST IS

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:23.108 region:rollup2
MEET OUR FEDERAL COMMITMENT IN

00:22:21.774 --> 00:22:25.044 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO GET SOME

00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:25.778 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL USE OUT OF THE

00:22:25.044 --> 00:22:27.880 region:rollup2
ASSETS WERE BUILDING THEIR.

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:29.515 region:rollup2
A LOT WE WANT TO EXAMINE AND I

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.783 region:rollup2
WON EXAMINE WHETHER HIGH SPEED

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:32.785 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFY TRAINS COULD BE

00:22:30.783 --> 00:22:35.154 region:rollup2
INITIALLY USED THEIR TO CUT DOWN

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:36.555 region:rollup2
THE TRAVEL TIMES NOW. WHAT IS

00:22:35.154 --> 00:22:37.823 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE THE AMTRAK SERVICE?

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.991 region:rollup2
AND ON THE WEST SIDE WE WANT

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:40.326 region:rollup2
EXTEND THE ELECTRIFICATION OF

00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:42.328 region:rollup2
CALTRAIN.

00:22:40.326 --> 00:22:43.896 region:rollup2
FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE

00:22:42.328 --> 00:22:45.364 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY TO GILROY.

00:22:43.896 --> 00:22:47.199 region:rollup2
THAT WILL MEAN THAT CALTRAIN

00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:49.001 region:rollup2
WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO USE

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:50.936 region:rollup2
DIESEL TRAINS FROM GILROY. A

00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:52.471 region:rollup2
GOING NORTH AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:53.706 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ELECTRIFIED IT WOULD BE

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:55.407 region:rollup2
READY FOR US AND WE ARE

00:22:53.706 --> 00:22:56.909 region:rollup2
EXAMINING WHETHER WE CAN PUT.

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:58.444 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFIED SERVICE

00:22:56.909 --> 00:23:00.012 region:rollup2
IN THERE AS AN INTERIM BASIS AS

00:22:58.444 --> 00:23:00.880 region:rollup2
EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY SIX OR

00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:02.014 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.549 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE PLAN

00:23:02.014 --> 00:23:05.684 region:rollup2
WERE DOING THE ANALYSIS NOW AND

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:07.720 region:rollup2
WILL REPORT BACK. TO LEGISLATURE

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:10.122 region:rollup2
IN THE PUBLIC ON ON HOW WE CAN

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.224 region:rollup2
PUT THAT INTO PLAY. A AND MARK

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:15.561 region:rollup2
THAT MORNING OPERATING SEGMENT.

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:17.296 region:rollup2
WILL RUN TRAINS OF SOME KIND.

00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:19.565 region:rollup2
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN MADERA

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:20.933 region:rollup2
AND BAKERS YEAH I WEEKTHAT'S A

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:22.234 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT WE HAVE WITH OUR

00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:23.869 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT TODAY.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:25.271 region:rollup2
THAT WE PUT THAT AND YOU WE PUT

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:29.208 region:rollup2
THOSE ASSETS INTO USE YOU YOU

00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:31.377 region:rollup2
CANNOT SAY TODAY THAT.

00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:32.611 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BE HIGH SPEED TRAINS

00:23:31.377 --> 00:23:34.013 region:rollup2
THEY BUT THEY MAY VERY WELL BE

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:35.948 region:rollup2
SLOW SPEED TRAIN.

00:23:34.013 --> 00:23:37.583 region:rollup2
OUR ASSETS INITIALLY ARE GOING

00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:39.184 region:rollup2
TO ARE NOT SORRY OUR ASSETS FOR

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:40.586 region:rollup2
THE TIRE ABOUT DEVELOP BEFORE

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:42.154 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED TRAIN SERVICE.

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:43.555 region:rollup2
ONCE WE COMPLETE ALL OF THE

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:45.491 region:rollup2
SYSTEM INCLUDING THE TUNNELING

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:46.825 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE PROJECT WILL PASS.

00:23:45.491 --> 00:23:48.928 region:rollup2
THAT'S STRETCHING THE CENTRAL

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:49.528 region:rollup2
VALLEY IN GOING WEST WILL TRAVEL

00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:50.729 region:rollup2
IN EXCESS OF TWO HUNDRED MILES

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:51.964 region:rollup2
PER HOUR.

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:54.066 region:rollup2
A WHEN WE GET TO THE SILICON

00:23:51.964 --> 00:23:54.667 region:rollup2
VALLEY WILL TRAVEL SPEEDS OF

00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:55.601 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY HUNDRED TEN MILES PER

00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:57.169 region:rollup2
HOUR.

00:23:55.601 --> 00:23:59.738 region:rollup2
THE IN THAT CORRIDOR.

00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:01.073 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT WE

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:02.341 region:rollup2
ALTERNATE WILL BUILD WE DON'T

00:24:01.073 --> 00:24:03.409 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL THE FUNDING IN HAND FOR

00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:05.077 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT NOW WE LIKELY HAVE A

00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:05.911 region:rollup2
FUNDING GAP.

00:24:05.077 --> 00:24:07.546 region:rollup2
THAT'S ABOUT THE COST OF THE

00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:09.448 region:rollup2
TUNNELS FOR THAT.

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:10.816 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE INTERIM WE DO WANT TO

00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:12.718 region:rollup2
PROVIDE MOBILITY BENEFITS WHERE

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:13.285 region:rollup2
WE CAN AND IF WE CAN PUT

00:24:12.718 --> 00:24:15.054 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFIED SERVICE IN THE

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:16.221 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY. SOONER

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:17.356 region:rollup2
CONNECTING WITH AMTRAK.

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:18.724 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK WE REDUCE THE

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:20.292 region:rollup2
AMTRAK TRAVEL TIME BY NINETY

00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:21.260 region:rollup2
MINUTES AND MAY BE ABLE TO

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:22.928 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE STATE SUBSIDY FOR

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.630 region:rollup2
THAT SYSTEM.

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:26.098 region:rollup2
THAT ANALYSIS IS UNDERWAY NOW

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.299 region:rollup2
AND WILL COME BACK A WITH THE

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:29.902 region:rollup2
PROJECT UPDATE REPORT FOR ALL OF

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:32.504 region:rollup2
YOU YOU DO RECOGNIZE THE SIZE

00:24:29.902 --> 00:24:35.074 region:rollup2
AND THE.

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:36.675 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT NATURE OF ATTAINING

00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:38.944 region:rollup2
THE GAP FUNDING.

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:41.380 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE TITLES.

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.981 region:rollup2
BUT I DO I DO A AND ONE OF THE

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.316 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT.

00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:45.784 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I WANNA ISOLATED ON ON

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:46.885 region:rollup2
ON THE TUNNELS I THINK.

00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:48.253 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MY VIEW IS ONCE YOU

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:49.988 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME SERVICES RUNNING ON

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:51.890 region:rollup2
EITHER SIDE. OF THE TUNNEL

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:52.858 region:rollup2
BECOMES AN OBVIOUS ELEMENT IN

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.727 region:rollup2
CONNECTING THE TWO.

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:56.695 region:rollup2
BY FOCUSING ON THE TUNNEL.

00:24:54.727 --> 00:24:58.163 region:rollup2
IN BRINGING IN SOME EXPERTISE

00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:59.331 region:rollup2
ON INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FUNDED.

00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:00.599 region:rollup2
AND ENGAGING OUR FEDERAL

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:01.934 region:rollup2
PARTNERS GOING FORWARD I THINK

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.501 region:rollup2
WE CAN.

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:04.103 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:05.671 region:rollup2
FIND AWAITING. WAY TO GET THERE

00:25:04.103 --> 00:25:06.905 region:rollup2
ON THE SPECIFIC ASSET THAT WILL

00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:08.240 region:rollup2
HAVE OBVIOUS MOBILITY BENEFIT

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:10.376 region:rollup2
WITH THE ELECTRIFICATION.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.578 region:rollup2
.

00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:14.279 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT GILROY TO SAN JOSE M..

00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:15.214 region:rollup2
.

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:17.383 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LONG.

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:19.752 region:rollup2
UNION PACIFIC.

00:25:17.383 --> 00:25:21.987 region:rollup2
LINES CORRECT DO YOU HAVE

00:25:19.752 --> 00:25:23.956 region:rollup2
PERMISSION.

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:25.657 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PURPOSE AS WE INDICATED

00:25:23.956 --> 00:25:27.025 region:rollup2
IN THE PLAN WE ARE NOT WE ARE

00:25:25.657 --> 00:25:28.527 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN TALKS WITH YOU P..

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:31.930 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THOSE

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:33.599 region:rollup2
TALKS POSITIVE?

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.834 region:rollup2
BUT YOU YOU YOU THINK THAT UNION

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:37.536 region:rollup2
PACIFIC WILL EVENTUALLY AGREE

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:38.370 region:rollup2
WHAT ALLOW YOU ACCESS BECAUSE I

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.738 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE IN THE

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.974 region:rollup2
ROOM IT'S A NEGOTIATION.

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:43.842 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. A

00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:45.744 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT IN AND WHAT WE WOULD

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:47.279 region:rollup2
DO IS USE THAT A RIGHT AWAY TO

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:49.114 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFY TWO TRACKS THAT ARE

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:50.149 region:rollup2
FOR PASSENGER RAIL AND MAINTAIN

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:52.017 region:rollup2
A FREIGHT TRACK FOR THEIR USE.

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:54.153 region:rollup2
OF IN THE RIGHT AWAY IT IS THE

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:55.754 region:rollup2
LEAST IMPACTFUL WAY. A TO GET

00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:57.656 region:rollup2
INTO THAT THAT SECTION THAT

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:58.557 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WE WILL NEED. AND WE

00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:59.658 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM IN

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:01.126 region:rollup2
GOOD FAITH HE ON TRYING TO GET

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:02.694 region:rollup2
THAT UP THE THE.

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:04.997 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR BUSINESS PLAN

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:05.264 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATES A RATHER.

00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:07.132 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:08.634 region:rollup2
.

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:09.768 region:rollup2
A DUBIOUS APPROACH TO THE

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:11.403 region:rollup2
FINANCING WHICH IS THE CAP AND

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:13.439 region:rollup2
TRADE.

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:14.239 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIRES EXTENSIONS AND

00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:16.141 region:rollup2
THAT AND THE LIKE AND.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:17.409 region:rollup2
ARE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:19.111 region:rollup2
OFFICE WHO SAID THAT A COMPLETE

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:20.979 region:rollup2
UNVIABLE FUNDING PLAN DOES NOT

00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:22.347 region:rollup2
EXIST.

00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:24.349 region:rollup2
FINDING IT IN THE BUSINESS PLAN

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:26.018 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO.

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:26.218 region:rollup2
I'M RELY ON EXTENDING CAP AND

00:26:26.018 --> 00:26:28.220 region:rollup2
TRADE.

00:26:26.218 --> 00:26:31.757 region:rollup2

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.825 region:rollup2
FROM YOUR BUSINESS PLAN YOUR.

00:26:31.757 --> 00:26:34.460 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING TO PROHIBIT THE

00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:35.394 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FROM RESTRICTING

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.829 region:rollup2
REDISTRIBUTE OR IMPAIRING THE

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:46.004 region:rollup2
AND GUARANTEED THAT THE

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.005 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WILL BACK FILL ANY

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:48.006 region:rollup2
SHORTFALL OF CAP AND TRADE

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:50.342 region:rollup2

IS GOING TO REQUIRE A VOTE OF

00:26:57.082 --> 00:27:00.419 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE.

00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:01.887 region:rollup2

STREAMS DEDICATED THE PRICE.

00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:34.119 region:rollup2
TO THE PROJECT IT WILL BE

00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:36.688 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO STAY ON SCHEDULE.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:38.524 region:rollup2
IN SO JUST AS WE SAID IN TWENTY

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:39.825 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN WE WANT TO TRY TO. BE

00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:41.827 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BRING FORWARD SOME OF

CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:45.264 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT.

00:27:44.196 --> 00:27:47.699 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE

00:27:45.264 --> 00:27:48.901 region:rollup2
MECHANISM AND SO. INDUSTRY HAD

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:50.469 region:rollup2
GIVEN US IT OUT HERE THREE

00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:53.906 region:rollup2
THINGS YOU LOOK FOR FOR THE

00:27:50.469 --> 00:27:56.508 region:rollup2
HIGHEST INVESTMENT GRADE.

00:27:53.906 --> 00:27:57.943 region:rollup2
THAN INVESTMENT GRADE STATUS OF

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:59.378 region:rollup2
A FINANCING YOU WANNA HAVE NOT

00:27:57.943 --> 00:28:01.446 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT YOU WANT TO HAVE A

00:27:59.378 --> 00:28:02.848 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO TWENTY FIFTY.

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:03.982 region:rollup2
ANYONE HAVE A FLORA FUNDING.

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:05.250 region:rollup2
I DON'T I CAN'T WE DON'T KNOW WE

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:07.119 region:rollup2
CAN GET ALL THOSE THINGS BUT

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.221 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A GO OR NO GO WE NEED

00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:10.889 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO. FINANCE AGAINST IT

00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:13.192 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE IS STRONGEST AS IT

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:13.692 region:rollup2
COULD BE DE BACK COMMITMENT TO

00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:15.160 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE CAN DO THE

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:17.896 region:rollup2
FINANCING.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.265 region:rollup2
AND EH HOWEVER STRONG IT IS IN

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:20.999 region:rollup2
STATUTE AND AND ARTICULATED IN

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:23.402 region:rollup2
THE LAW.

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:24.770 region:rollup2
WE WILL GET A IT WILL REFLECT

00:28:23.402 --> 00:28:25.871 region:rollup2
OUR RICH ARE RISK OR COST OF

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.105 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:28.607 region:rollup2
SO WITH THESE THREE ELEMENTS

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:30.576 region:rollup2
WITH HAVE THE VERY CHEAPEST CASA

00:28:28.607 --> 00:28:31.877 region:rollup2
CAPITAL WITH ELEMENTS THAT ARE.

00:28:30.576 --> 00:28:33.378 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SHADES OF GRAY ON IT TO

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:34.813 region:rollup2
THE BECAUSE CAPITA MICHAEL

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:36.014 region:rollup2
HIGHER BUT WE WOULD STILL YOU

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:38.717 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S THERE'S.

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:39.952 region:rollup2
LARGE SORT OF SWINGS IN IN WHAT

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:43.488 region:rollup2
YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BASIC

00:28:39.952 --> 00:28:44.289 region:rollup2
FINANCING WATER POINT IS.

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:45.857 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO FINANCE THE REVENUE

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:47.593 region:rollup2
STREAM TO BRING THE DOLLARS FOR

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:48.193 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE CAPITAL COSTS AT THE

00:28:47.593 --> 00:28:49.294 region:rollup2
TIME WE HAVE THEM TO BUILD THE

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:50.395 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:51.930 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING WE SAID

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:54.132 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SOMETHING

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.767 region:rollup2
WE'RE REPEATING TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:57.736 region:rollup2
AGAIN I WANT TO.

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:59.871 region:rollup2
I REALLY DO WANT TO FOCUS YOU

00:28:57.736 --> 00:29:02.107 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE MADE SOME SPECIFIC.

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:03.775 region:rollup2
CONTINGENCIES IN THE PLAN TO

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:04.876 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:06.712 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:08.180 region:rollup2
AND.

00:29:06.712 --> 00:29:11.016 region:rollup2
ARE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:13.151 region:rollup2
ADVISED US THAT ONLY A VOTE OF

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:15.487 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE CAN REQUIRE. A FUTURE

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:17.689 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO COMMIT FUNDS OR

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:20.158 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT A FUTURE LEGISLATURE

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:23.328 region:rollup2
FROM CHANGING AN APPROPRIATION.

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:24.896 region:rollup2
ARE YOU AWARE AND DO YOU CONCUR

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:26.531 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT IS IN YOUR BUSINESS

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:29.368 region:rollup2
PLAN REQUIRES A VOTE OF THE

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:30.235 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:29:29.368 --> 00:29:31.703 region:rollup2
I DON'T NECESSARILY CONCUR WITH

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:31.937 region:rollup2
THAT YET

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:34.439 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:35.540 region:rollup2
I DON'T.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.708 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.143 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE CAP AND TRADE

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:39.478 region:rollup2
REVENUE STREAM I THINK.

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:41.046 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE A CONTINUES

00:29:39.478 --> 00:29:42.714 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION IF WE ARE GIVEN

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:44.583 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO REVENUE

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:45.917 region:rollup2
BOND OFF THAT APPROPRIATION. OF

00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:46.785 region:rollup2
BUT WE CAN'T DO THE IMPAIRMENT

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:48.387 region:rollup2
WOULD STILL GO FORWARD WITH

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.821 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FINANCES.

00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:51.189 region:rollup2
MAYBE WITHOUT THE IMPAIRMENT IN

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:53.792 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:55.160 region:rollup2
HAVE AS HIGH RATED. A OF A

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:56.862 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL STRUCTURES POSSIBLE

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.796 region:rollup2
BUT IT CONTINUES APPROPRIATION

00:29:56.862 --> 00:29:59.765 region:rollup2
IS PRETTY GOOD WHICH WE ALREADY

00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:01.600 region:rollup2
HAVE. OF AN AUTHORITY TO ISSUE

00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:03.735 region:rollup2
REVENUE BONDS OFF THAT'S THAT

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.270 region:rollup2
STREAM IS HELPFUL. A WE WOULD IT

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:06.805 region:rollup2
WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE SOME

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.706 region:rollup2
FLOOR OF A COMMITMENT IN THERE.

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:09.308 region:rollup2
BUT WOULD THAT UNDER THE LAW

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:10.309 region:rollup2
TODAY IS A CONTINUES THE

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:11.710 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATED MATTER WE HAVE

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:13.245 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.046 region:rollup2
A IF THAT'S IF THERE'S A FLOOR

00:30:13.245 --> 00:30:16.114 region:rollup2
THAT'S TIED TO THAT.

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:17.349 region:rollup2
IT WOULD HELP US FINANCE THE

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:18.617 region:rollup2
AGAINST THAT REVENUE STREAM BUT

00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:19.951 region:rollup2
IT.

00:30:18.617 --> 00:30:21.753 region:rollup2
BUT FOR FOR THIS MEMBER IT SEEMS

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:22.821 region:rollup2
PRETTY PRETTY CUT AND DRIED THAT

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:24.322 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IN THE

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:25.757 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN IS GOING TO

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:28.694 region:rollup2
REQUIRE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IF.

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:30.162 region:rollup2
YET DUBBED BECOMES A EVIDENT.

00:30:28.694 --> 00:30:31.797 region:rollup2
THAT IN ORDER TO ACTUALIZE THE

00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:35.467 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN.

00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:37.202 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU BE ARE GOING TO GO TO

00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:40.172 region:rollup2
A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT AN

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:41.373 region:rollup2
OPTION. AS YOU CONSIDER.

00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:43.775 region:rollup2
AT LEAST THE BUSINESS PLAN IN

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:46.111 region:rollup2
FRONT OF THIS WHICH I THINK AT

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:46.812 region:rollup2
AT DOES ACTUALLY REQUIRE.

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:48.413 region:rollup2
AT LEAST OF A CHANGE IN THE

00:30:46.812 --> 00:30:49.581 region:rollup2
STATE CONSTITUTION

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:50.482 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE

00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:51.416 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF VOTE OF THE PEOPLE

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:53.118 region:rollup2
HERE TO LET YOU DO WHAT YOU ARE

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:55.220 region:rollup2
PLANNING TO WE WE WE PUT IN THE

00:30:53.118 --> 00:30:56.121 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN. AND AS WE TOUTS

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.556 region:rollup2
THE THREE THINGS YOU NEED FOR

00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:58.957 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST INVESTMENT GRADE

00:30:57.556 --> 00:31:00.826 region:rollup2
FINANCING WE OUTLINED WHAT THE

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:01.693 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY GAVE US IS THESE ARE

00:31:00.826 --> 00:31:03.061 region:rollup2
THE THREE THINGS YOU NEED.

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:04.629 region:rollup2
I LOOK AT IT HAVING COME FROM

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:06.398 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND SAID AND

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:08.233 region:rollup2
LOOK AT AND SAY. GIVE THOSE ARE

00:31:06.398 --> 00:31:09.534 region:rollup2
THREE THINGS THAT THE INDUSTRY.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:10.669 region:rollup2
POINT OUT AS THE HEIGHT BEST

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:12.270 region:rollup2
THINK YOU NEED FOR AN INVESTMENT

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:13.105 region:rollup2
GRADE RATING.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.140 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW YOU CAN GET ALL

00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:17.642 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS AND BUT I DO THINK

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.144 region:rollup2
YOU CAN STILL FINANCE WITH LEFT.

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:20.112 region:rollup2
AND WILL THEN WHAT WE SAID IN

00:31:19.144 --> 00:31:21.279 region:rollup2
THE PLANS WOULD WORK WITH THE

00:31:20.112 --> 00:31:22.681 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:24.349 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ON EXACTLY WHAT THE

00:31:22.681 --> 00:31:26.618 region:rollup2
FINANCING AUTHORITY LOOKS LIKE.

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:27.686 region:rollup2
TO GO FORWARD SO I DON'T HAVE A

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:29.287 region:rollup2
PLAN RIGHT NOW TO GO THE VOTER

00:31:27.686 --> 00:31:30.522 region:rollup2
PEOPLE I'M NOT SURE WE NEED TO

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:31.923 region:rollup2
GO TO VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. OF

00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:33.959 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK AT THAT AND WE WILL

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:34.993 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW

00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:36.461 region:rollup2
WE CAN BEST DEFINE HOW WE CAN

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:37.662 region:rollup2
FROM FINANCE AGAINST THE REVENUE

00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:38.463 region:rollup2
STREAM ALREADY COMMITTED TO THE

00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:40.232 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:41.500 region:rollup2
AND OUR HOPE IS TO.

00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:43.535 region:rollup2
GETS SOME KIND OF FINANCING SO

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.503 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE WE CAN

00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:45.537 region:rollup2
DELIVER THE PROJECT IN THE

00:31:44.503 --> 00:31:47.806 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT SOONER

00:31:45.537 --> 00:31:49.674 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN LATER.

00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:51.843 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE NEED OR

00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:52.778 region:rollup2
PUSH FOR THE FINANCING IS JUST.

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:53.011 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE CAN BE CAPITAL

00:31:52.778 --> 00:31:54.780 region:rollup2
COSTS IN

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:56.515 region:rollup2
I.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.216 region:rollup2
THEN AGAIN I I.

00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:59.384 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS OPINED

00:31:58.216 --> 00:32:01.820 region:rollup2
ON THIS AND I THINK THAT'S A

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:03.054 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT THE OPINION AM I

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.689 region:rollup2
THINK IT NEEDS TO BE PAID

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:06.525 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TOO HIGH AT. OUT

BEFORE YOU RESPOND WITH NOW.

00:32:06.525 --> 00:32:09.227 region:rollup2
KIND OF.

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:12.998 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:13.265 region:rollup2
SEVERAL TIMES I THINK WE GET IT.

00:32:12.998 --> 00:32:17.068 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:19.004 region:rollup2
.

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:21.439 region:rollup2
I'M GENERALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:32:19.004 --> 00:32:23.842 region:rollup2
WHAT IS PLAN B. IT IT ALMA

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:24.309 region:rollup2
SURFACE UP THIS DOES NOT LOOK

00:32:23.842 --> 00:32:26.178 region:rollup2
LIKE IT'S GOING TO GET

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:27.512 region:rollup2
COMPLETED.

00:32:26.178 --> 00:32:29.347 region:rollup2
I KNOW YOU YOU YOU ARE

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:30.816 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTIC AND YOU WANT TO BE

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:33.151 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE AND AND ALL OF THAT.

00:32:30.816 --> 00:32:34.820 region:rollup2
BUT THE BUT ECONOMIC GRAVITY HAS

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:36.688 region:rollup2
REALLY KICKING IN HERE.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.523 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE IS A

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:40.525 region:rollup2
PLAN B..

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:42.394 region:rollup2
IT IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU JUST

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:42.928 region:rollup2
SIMPLY.

00:32:42.394 --> 00:32:45.664 region:rollup2
A CANNOT BUILD THE ENTIRE

00:32:42.928 --> 00:32:47.632 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:32:45.664 --> 00:32:49.501 region:rollup2
A ARCTIC ARE YOU CONSIDERING A

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:51.937 region:rollup2
PLAN BE IS THERE A CONTINGENCY

00:32:49.501 --> 00:32:53.305 region:rollup2
PLAN OF SOME KIND.

00:32:51.937 --> 00:32:54.406 region:rollup2
WELL MISTER PATTERSON I AGAIN I

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:56.141 region:rollup2
GUESS I'D SAY THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:32:54.406 --> 00:32:57.476 region:rollup2
A CONVERSATION THAT'S A BROADER

00:32:56.141 --> 00:33:00.579 region:rollup2
THAN JUST OFFICES CAN INVOLVE

00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:01.713 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND US OF. IT

00:33:00.579 --> 00:33:04.382 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD I YOU KNOW.

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:06.585 region:rollup2
I'VE STEPPED INTO THIS AND I

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:08.353 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT I HAVE.

00:33:06.585 --> 00:33:09.688 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT IT SHORT OF WHAT

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:11.656 region:rollup2
WE NEED IN THE PROJECT HAS

00:33:09.688 --> 00:33:12.691 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BEEN IN THAT CONDITION

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.725 region:rollup2
SINCE THE DAY THE VOTERS APPROVE

00:33:12.691 --> 00:33:14.826 region:rollup2
THE RITUAL PONDS.

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:16.194 region:rollup2
THEY'VE NEVER HAD ALL THE MONEY

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.729 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO GO.

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:19.231 region:rollup2
AND SO THE AUTHORITY ADOPTED A

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:20.899 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE THAT SAID WITH THE

00:33:19.231 --> 00:33:21.967 region:rollup2
FUNDING WE HAVE WE WILL BUILD

00:33:20.899 --> 00:33:23.401 region:rollup2
INCREMENTALLY TO PROVIDE

00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:25.370 region:rollup2
BENEFITS EARLY.

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:26.171 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY LINKING ALL OF THE

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.905 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS WE MAKE FOR THE FULL

00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:28.907 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:33:26.905 --> 00:33:30.642 region:rollup2
AND.

00:33:28.907 --> 00:33:32.043 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE

00:33:30.642 --> 00:33:32.644 region:rollup2
WAY TO GO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:34.279 region:rollup2
EVERY DOLLAR YOU NEED FOR THE

00:33:32.644 --> 00:33:36.882 region:rollup2
FULL SYSTEM.

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:39.017 region:rollup2
SO I'M PROPOSING A BUSINESS PLAN

00:33:36.882 --> 00:33:41.453 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHAT I KNOW WE HAVE.

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:43.054 region:rollup2

I TOOK THIS JOB I DO THIS

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:54.466 region:rollup2

THAT WE HAD AT THEIR OR. I WAS

00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:57.322 region:rollup2
ONE OF KIND OF GO AND KIND OF A

00:35:56.121 --> 00:35:58.990 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DIRECTION WHICH IS.

00:35:57.322 --> 00:36:02.394 region:rollup2
THE F. ORTIZ AGREEMENT WITH THE

00:36:02.394 --> 00:36:03.294 region:rollup2
ALL THE WORK IN THE CENTER

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:03.962 region:rollup2
VALLEY PORTION.

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:05.563 region:rollup2
THE COMPLETED BY DECEMBER THIRTY

00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:06.731 region:rollup2
FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHAT

00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:08.633 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IF THE AUTHORITY FAILS

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:10.035 region:rollup2
TO MEET THAT DEADLINE.

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:11.936 region:rollup2
WELL A COUPLE THINGS ONE.

00:36:10.035 --> 00:36:13.438 region:rollup2
WE PROBABLY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN

00:36:11.936 --> 00:36:14.939 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF NEGOTIATION OF THE

00:36:13.438 --> 00:36:17.042 region:rollup2
UPPER A FOR AN EXTENSION IF

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:17.442 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:20.345 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD SAY.

00:36:17.442 --> 00:36:20.578 region:rollup2
THERE YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE

00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:21.479 region:rollup2
OPEN TO.

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:23.415 region:rollup2
.

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:25.383 region:rollup2
REPAYMENT PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL

00:36:23.415 --> 00:36:26.785 region:rollup2
FUNDS BUT AGAIN I THINK TIPPIT

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:28.620 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.

00:36:26.785 --> 00:36:30.288 region:rollup2
IS THAT WAS ONCE AN EARLIER

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.823 region:rollup2
DEADLINE THAT WAS RENEGOTIATED

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:32.424 region:rollup2
SOMETIME AGO WELL BEFORE I GOT

00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:33.691 region:rollup2
HERE OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:36:32.424 --> 00:36:35.827 region:rollup2
SO.

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:38.163 region:rollup2
WE WORK WITH THE FRA ó ALL THE

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:39.931 region:rollup2
TIME ON A WEEKLY DAILY BASIS AND

00:36:38.163 --> 00:36:41.299 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD OF PROBABLY BEING

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:42.634 region:rollup2
DISCUSSES IT WITH THEM WELL IN

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:44.102 region:rollup2
ADVANCE OF THE DEADLINE ABOUT

00:36:42.634 --> 00:36:45.370 region:rollup2
SHOULD IT MOVE BUT ARE. A

00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:47.872 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY OUR INTENTION IN MY

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:49.441 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE TODAY IS TO MEET THOSE

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.808 region:rollup2
DEADLINES AS WE ARTICULATED THE

00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:51.376 region:rollup2
BUSINESS

00:36:49.808 --> 00:36:52.811 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THERE

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:54.446 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REPAYMENT IF WE DID

00:36:52.811 --> 00:36:55.413 region:rollup2
MEET THAT DEADLINE MINUTES ABOUT

00:36:54.446 --> 00:36:57.482 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES. IT'S THEORETICALLY

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:58.083 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH I THINK IN

00:36:57.482 --> 00:36:58.850 region:rollup2
PRACTICE AS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN

00:36:58.083 --> 00:37:00.218 region:rollup2
WE'VE

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.454 region:rollup2
WE'VE WORKED WITH THE OPERATE

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:03.588 region:rollup2
RENEGOTIATE DATES

00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:05.323 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST CONCERN

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:06.124 region:rollup2
AS I AS I HEAR YOU ANSWER

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:07.459 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:37:06.124 --> 00:37:09.894 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PASSIONATE AND TO AND

00:37:07.459 --> 00:37:11.996 region:rollup2
TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE IS UP.

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:14.132 region:rollup2
WE HEAR PHRASES LIKE UNFUNDED

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:16.101 region:rollup2
ASSETS MISSING LINK. UP FUNDING

00:37:14.132 --> 00:37:16.801 region:rollup2
GAPS AND AT WHAT POINT IS THIS

00:37:16.101 --> 00:37:19.104 region:rollup2
PROJECT

00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:20.672 region:rollup2
COST HIM.

00:37:19.104 --> 00:37:23.875 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS THERE THAT ASSESSMENT

00:37:20.672 --> 00:37:25.343 region:rollup2
THAT YOU THAT YOU WOULD MAKE.

00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:26.711 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:28.680 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN THE MOBILITY.

00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:30.482 region:rollup2
THE BENEFITS THAT IT WOULD

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.749 region:rollup2
BRING. THERE WERE SOME WORK DONE

00:37:30.482 --> 00:37:32.650 region:rollup2
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:34.185 region:rollup2
SAID YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WOULD

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.754 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO DO TO PROVIDE THE

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:37.188 region:rollup2
SAME LEVEL OF MOBILITY BENEFITS.

00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:37.956 region:rollup2
THROUGH HIGHWAY EXPANSIONS

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:39.724 region:rollup2
AIRPORT EXPANSIONS AND OTHER

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:40.859 region:rollup2
THINGS YOU KNOW IT'S ROUGHLY

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:41.893 region:rollup2
DOUBLE THE COST OF OUR BASELINE

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:43.728 region:rollup2
COST ESTIMATES.

00:37:41.893 --> 00:37:46.131 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:47.265 region:rollup2
THAT THAT LINE IS BUT THAT THAT

00:37:46.131 --> 00:37:47.599 region:rollup2
DATA IS OUT THERE TO BAIL BONE

00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:49.200 region:rollup2
IT'S PUBLIC.

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:51.336 region:rollup2
.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.570 region:rollup2
A I.

00:37:51.336 --> 00:37:54.072 region:rollup2
BOB MY OBJECTIVE IN WHAT WE THAT

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.440 region:rollup2
OUTLINE OF THE BUSINESS PLAN IS

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:57.509 region:rollup2
TO PROCEED IN A WAY WHERE WE DO

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.743 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE. STRANDED ASSETS WITH

00:37:57.509 --> 00:37:59.844 region:rollup2
THE ASSETS WE BUILT WE PUT INTO

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:02.180 region:rollup2
USE.

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:03.615 region:rollup2
A WE DO HAVE UNFUNDED PORTION

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.682 region:rollup2
THE VALLEY TO VALLEY AND WE'RE

00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:06.918 region:rollup2
GONNA FOCUS EFFORT AND TIME ON

00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:09.020 region:rollup2
THAT. UP BUT THE STRANDED ACID

00:38:06.918 --> 00:38:10.588 region:rollup2
ISSUE IS ONE THAT I. WOULD PUSH

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.056 region:rollup2
BACK ON LIGHTLY JUST BECAUSE OUR

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:13.858 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE IS TO INVEST IN A WAY

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:14.993 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT HAVE STRANDED ASSETS

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:15.960 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD BUT THINGS ARE

00:38:14.993 --> 00:38:18.062 region:rollup2
BEING PUT INTO GIVES.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.031 region:rollup2
SO JUST JUST THERE REWRITE IT

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:21.366 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO POINT THERE IS NO

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:23.535 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD THAT.

00:38:21.366 --> 00:38:25.803 region:rollup2
IF THE COSTS CONTINUE TO GROW OR

00:38:23.535 --> 00:38:27.305 region:rollup2
EXPAND THAT YOU WOULD NOT AFFORD

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:29.107 region:rollup2
NO MATTER WHAT NO PUN INTENDED

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:30.341 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO POINT.

00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:31.576 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD THINK THAT THE THE

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:32.877 region:rollup2
PROJECT WOULD BE WE KNOW THAT WE

00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:34.813 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO REASSESS AND

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:37.882 region:rollup2
THAT THIS PROJECT MAY NOT BE THE

00:38:34.813 --> 00:38:38.950 region:rollup2
WAY TO. GO.

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:40.652 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS RIGHT

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.387 region:rollup2
NOW TODAY I I THINK YOU KNOW

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:44.489 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'M BUILDING SOMETHING.

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:45.557 region:rollup2
WITH AVAILABLE REVENUES I HAVE

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:47.292 region:rollup2
BEEN INCREMENTAL WAY WE HAVE A

00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:48.793 region:rollup2
COST ESTIMATE THAT WERE. UP FOR

00:38:47.292 --> 00:38:50.295 region:rollup2
THE VALUE VALLEY SECTION THAT I

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:52.096 region:rollup2
THINK WILL BE A VERY USEFUL A.

00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:54.132 region:rollup2
SEGMENT

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:54.732 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE THAT

00:38:54.132 --> 00:38:57.235 region:rollup2
WERE YOU KNOW.

00:38:54.732 --> 00:38:58.469 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T WE CAN CLOSE THE GAP

00:38:57.235 --> 00:38:59.370 region:rollup2
ON I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT OF GOING

00:38:58.469 --> 00:38:59.537 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.506 region:rollup2
SO.

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:02.740 region:rollup2
.

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:04.843 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T HAVE A BETTER ANSWER

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.410 region:rollup2
THAT TODAY ON THAT I'M I'M

00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.945 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON TRYING TO GET IT

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.847 region:rollup2
DONE.

00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:10.448 region:rollup2
AND AS THE MY LAST QUESTION

00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:10.682 region:rollup2
SINCE MAYES CERTAINLY VISIT.

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:13.284 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

00:39:10.682 --> 00:39:13.885 region:rollup2
THIS TRAP BUSINESS PLAN HAS

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:15.453 region:rollup2
EVOLVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF

00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:17.655 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT.

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:19.090 region:rollup2
YOU DO NOT SEE A POINT WHERE THE

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:23.394 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER SAY

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:24.195 region:rollup2
ON THIS PROJECT.

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:26.698 region:rollup2
I MEAN I IT AGAIN.

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:28.466 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:31.202 region:rollup2
OUR I'M HERE TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:32.937 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS WILL AND AND TO ME.

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:35.039 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WENT TO THE VOTERS

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:37.075 region:rollup2
AND ASK FOR ONE FIFTH OF THE

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:38.476 region:rollup2
THEN. ESTIMATED COSTS AND THEY

00:39:37.075 --> 00:39:40.879 region:rollup2
APPROVED IT.

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:41.613 region:rollup2
AND I'M SEEING NUMBERS IT

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:43.414 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS ARE STILL GENERALLY

00:39:41.613 --> 00:39:44.382 region:rollup2
THAT SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT IN MY

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.850 region:rollup2
JOB IS TRIED TO IMPLEMENT WHAT

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:48.119 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.954 region:rollup2
AND AND I'M FOCUSED ON THAT AND

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:52.257 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. AND.

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:54.892 region:rollup2
LA I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:56.828 region:rollup2
BEYOND A USING THE AT THE

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:57.829 region:rollup2
RESOURCES I HAVE TO TRY TO

00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:59.264 region:rollup2
DELIVER THE PROJECT AS BEST I

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:01.432 region:rollup2
CAN AND THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT

00:39:59.264 --> 00:40:01.1000 region:rollup2
MY FOCUSES BUT WOULD YOU SAY

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:03.468 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU AGREE THOUGH THAT

00:40:01.1000 --> 00:40:05.637 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:40:03.468 --> 00:40:07.905 region:rollup2
WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED ONLINE?

00:40:05.637 --> 00:40:09.807 region:rollup2
IMPROV WHEN A WHEN WHAT THE

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:11.843 region:rollup2
PROJECT IS TODAY HAS CHANGED NOW

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:13.645 region:rollup2
FOR ARE NOW I WOULD SAY THAT OUR

00:40:11.843 --> 00:40:15.647 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE IS TO BUILD THE ONE A

00:40:13.645 --> 00:40:17.115 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO BUILD IT

00:40:15.647 --> 00:40:18.349 region:rollup2
INCREMENTALLY. AND WAY TO BUILD

00:40:17.115 --> 00:40:18.983 region:rollup2
AN INCREMENTALLY BECAUSE WE

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:20.985 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ALL THE MONEY WE NEED

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:22.687 region:rollup2
TO BUILD ALL AT ONCE.

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:24.956 region:rollup2
AND SO BUT OUR BUT WHAT WE WILL

00:40:22.687 --> 00:40:25.490 region:rollup2
BUILD WILL BE THE ONE A PROJECT

00:40:24.956 --> 00:40:26.858 region:rollup2
BUT THE BUSINESS PLAN HAS

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:28.059 region:rollup2
CHANGED.

00:40:26.858 --> 00:40:29.961 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST BUYERS OF ALL IF THE

00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:32.130 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN. EVERY TWO YEARS

00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:33.598 region:rollup2
IS A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE THIS IS I

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.500 region:rollup2
THINK THIS BUSINESS PLAN HAVE

00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:36.968 region:rollup2
SOME CONTINUITY WITH THE TWENTY

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.003 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN IN TERMS

00:40:36.968 --> 00:40:40.171 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE. AND

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:41.472 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PRINCIPLES R. THAT WE

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:43.141 region:rollup2
BRING. THERE ARE IMPORTANT

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:43.708 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOW WE

00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:44.375 region:rollup2
PRESENT THOSE THINGS IN THE

00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:45.643 region:rollup2
PAST.

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.945 region:rollup2
AND HOW I PRESENT THEM TO YOU

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:48.913 region:rollup2
ALL TODAY.

00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:50.248 region:rollup2
AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:51.816 region:rollup2
HAVE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISK THAT

00:40:50.248 --> 00:40:53.584 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:55.186 region:rollup2
AND IT MAKES IT HARD TO BUILD A

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:56.754 region:rollup2
MATE THAT MAKE A PROJECT.

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:57.188 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:59.557 region:rollup2
WE WERE YOU KNOW.

00:40:57.188 --> 00:41:01.225 region:rollup2
IT'S.

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.826 region:rollup2
A CANDID DESCRIPTION OF WHAT

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:04.028 region:rollup2
THOSE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISKS

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:04.996 region:rollup2
ARE. AND OUR APPROACH IN THE

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:05.163 region:rollup2
FACE OF THOSE THINGS.

00:41:04.996 --> 00:41:07.098 region:rollup2
AND.

00:41:05.163 --> 00:41:08.1000 region:rollup2
.

00:41:07.098 --> 00:41:11.369 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY I FEEL LIKE I'M

00:41:08.1000 --> 00:41:13.604 region:rollup2
OBLIGATED TO PRESENT TO YOU ALL.

00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:14.906 region:rollup2
AND LAY OUT A STRATEGY FOR HOW

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:18.042 region:rollup2
WILL GO FORWARD. AND.

00:41:14.906 --> 00:41:19.811 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE.

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:22.180 region:rollup2
WAS I I I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR.

00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:24.248 region:rollup2
.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.884 region:rollup2
YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK THAT AS

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:28.152 region:rollup2
WE REVIEW THE BUSINESS PLAN.

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:29.754 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THERE ARE SITES

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:30.922 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THAT DIED THAT THE

00:41:29.754 --> 00:41:31.856 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THERE'S UNCERTAINTIES

00:41:30.922 --> 00:41:33.992 region:rollup2
IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:35.293 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THERE IS GOING

00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:37.328 region:rollup2
TO BE A POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING

00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:38.796 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO DECIDE.

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:40.565 region:rollup2
THROUGH REALISTICALLY AND

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:42.367 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVELY AND LOOKING AT THIS

00:41:40.565 --> 00:41:43.434 region:rollup2
WITH LL THE FACTS.

00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:45.003 region:rollup2
AND FRONT OF US THAT WHETHER

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:47.739 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD

00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:49.774 region:rollup2
AT ALL. AND AND I HOPE THAT THE

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:51.776 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY WOULD.

00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:52.276 region:rollup2
DO THAT DO THE SAME THING.

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:54.345 region:rollup2
AND SAY IS THIS FEASIBLE

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:56.948 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:58.783 region:rollup2
IF THE GAPS EXIST AND WE CAN'T

00:41:56.948 --> 00:41:59.951 region:rollup2
CONNECTED TO IT BUT TAKE A PASS

00:41:58.783 --> 00:42:01.319 region:rollup2
ISN'T BUILT WE HAVE TO STRANDED

00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:02.453 region:rollup2
LINE.

00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:04.689 region:rollup2
THAT MAY FUNCTION.

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:06.824 region:rollup2
ON ITS OWN BUT THEY NEVER

00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:08.192 region:rollup2
CONNECTIN SO IF THE IF THE

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:09.394 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT IS WE'RE GONNA WE'RE

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.762 region:rollup2
GONNA DO THIS NO MATTER WHAT BUT

00:42:09.394 --> 00:42:12.497 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MY.

00:42:10.762 --> 00:42:13.731 region:rollup2
FROM I THINK WE HAVE THAT WE

00:42:12.497 --> 00:42:14.532 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE A REAL ASSESSMENT

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:15.767 region:rollup2
OF WHETHER THAT'S.

00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:16.801 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE SHOULD GET YOU DOWN

00:42:15.767 --> 00:42:18.236 region:rollup2
THAT PATH SO I THINK YOU MAY

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:19.470 region:rollup2
MOVE WE WILL CERTAINLY ENGAGED

00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:20.772 region:rollup2
IN THAT CONVERSATION GOING

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.639 region:rollup2
TOWARD ABSOLUTELY FOR ME

00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:23.775 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY.

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:25.843 region:rollup2
I.

00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:27.345 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE THE BENEFITS OF

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:28.613 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT.

00:42:27.345 --> 00:42:30.515 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:32.250 region:rollup2
SO IMMENSE THAT IN MY TIME DOING

00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:34.085 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION POLICY I HAVEN'T

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.020 region:rollup2
SEEN A. SINGLE PROJECT THAT

00:42:34.085 --> 00:42:36.554 region:rollup2
OFFERS AS MUCH MOBILITY AND

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.588 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:40.124 region:rollup2

USE IT SO YOU GET IT OUT FAST.

00:48:13.524 --> 00:48:16.394 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AS A

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:17.795 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THAT WE WERE WE WERE

00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:19.430 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

00:48:17.795 --> 00:48:20.898 region:rollup2
SHOVING A LOT OF MONEY INTO

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:22.767 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION WHEN WE DID NOT

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:23.634 region:rollup2
HAVE PROPERTY.

00:48:22.767 --> 00:48:25.202 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT HAS BEEN A

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:27.438 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:29.607 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO COST.

00:48:27.438 --> 00:48:31.475 region:rollup2
AND DELAY.

00:48:29.607 --> 00:48:32.977 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOMEWHERE IN

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:36.213 region:rollup2
SOME OF YOUR EARLY.

00:48:32.977 --> 00:48:37.882 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND MAYBE IN THE MEDIA.

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:39.650 region:rollup2
THAT YOU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THAT

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:40.684 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.654 region:rollup2
YOU CHARACTERIZED IT AS WE WE

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:44.388 region:rollup2
DIDN'T.

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:46.190 region:rollup2
WE COULD NOT BUT WE DIDN'T.

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:49.326 region:rollup2
REALLY.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:52.062 region:rollup2
PRICE IN AND ANALYZE THE COST

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:52.997 region:rollup2
AND DELAY RISKS OF.

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:55.166 region:rollup2
THOROUGHLY AND THAT KIND OF

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:58.235 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:59.770 region:rollup2
NOW THAT YOUR AT THE HELM OUR

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:01.639 region:rollup2
WILL THAT BE A.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.774 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED APPROACH

00:49:01.639 --> 00:49:05.576 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WORDS.

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:08.345 region:rollup2
YOU PUT THE MONEY OUT WHEN YOU

00:49:05.576 --> 00:49:08.879 region:rollup2
GOT THE PROPERTY AND NOT BEFORE.

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.114 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION.

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:11.482 region:rollup2
.

00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:13.617 region:rollup2
CHAPTER FOUR OF OUR BUSINESS

00:49:11.482 --> 00:49:14.185 region:rollup2
PLAN GOES INTO GREAT DETAIL ON

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.553 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE AND YOU'RE RIGHT

00:49:14.185 --> 00:49:16.787 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:49:15.553 --> 00:49:18.355 region:rollup2
.

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:19.356 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WERE

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:21.025 region:rollup2
MADE AVAILABLE HAD AN

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:23.260 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE DEADLINE ON THEM.

00:49:21.025 --> 00:49:24.762 region:rollup2
TO SPEND BY SEPTEMBER TWENTY

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:27.431 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

00:49:24.762 --> 00:49:28.666 region:rollup2
UP SO OF THE AUTHORITY WAS QUICK

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:31.368 region:rollup2
INTO GOING TO CAN CONSTRUCTION

00:49:28.666 --> 00:49:32.603 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS AND. A YOU KNOW IT'S A

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:34.472 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF A DOUBLE EDGED

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:35.973 region:rollup2
SWORD ARE ON THE ONE HAND. THE

00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:37.041 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN THE VALLEY HAVE

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:39.176 region:rollup2
PAID OFF.

00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:40.744 region:rollup2
WITH SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE

00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:42.179 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC OUTPUT NUMBERS BY

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:43.881 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT CONSTRUCTION GOING

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:45.683 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE STRUCTURES AND

00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREA.

00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:49.386 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ALL EXTRAORDINARILY

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:50.488 region:rollup2
POSITIVE ON ON THE DOWN ON THE

00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:52.022 region:rollup2
FLIPSIDE.

00:49:50.488 --> 00:49:53.591 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RIGHT THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:55.693 region:rollup2
ALL THE RIGHT AWAY IN HAND A

00:49:53.591 --> 00:49:56.627 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO GOING A RELEASING THOSE

00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:57.461 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS WHICH

00:49:56.627 --> 00:49:59.196 region:rollup2
MEANS.

00:49:57.461 --> 00:50:02.233 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE RISK.

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:03.801 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED IN MITIGATED AND.

00:50:02.233 --> 00:50:05.135 region:rollup2
AS A MATTER PRACTICE GOING

00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:06.337 region:rollup2
FORWARD OF WHAT I'VE SAID IN

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:08.172 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NOTED IN THE BUSINESS

00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:10.107 region:rollup2
PLAN IS THAT MOVING FORWARD.

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:11.475 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOT REPEAT THAT. THAT

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:13.043 region:rollup2
APPROACH WE WOULD DATA.

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:14.678 region:rollup2
WE WOULD SORT OF HAVE ALL THE

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:16.046 region:rollup2
ALL THE THINGS IN THE BOX KNOWN

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:18.916 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED IN MITIGATED TO THE

00:50:16.046 --> 00:50:20.317 region:rollup2
BEST OF OUR ABILITY BEFORE WE GO

00:50:18.916 --> 00:50:22.519 region:rollup2
TO CONSTRUCTION CUT THAT HAS CUT

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:23.153 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING AND AND.

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:24.421 region:rollup2
.

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:26.357 region:rollup2
COMMITTING BEFORE PROPERTY HAS

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:28.192 region:rollup2
HAS ALSO LED.

00:50:26.357 --> 00:50:30.694 region:rollup2
BUT AT LEAST I'M AWARE OF ONE

00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:31.161 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT THERE MAY BE MORE WITH

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.897 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE SMALL.

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:34.431 region:rollup2
.

00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:36.200 region:rollup2
BOB BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HAD THE

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:37.668 region:rollup2

CONCERN OVER.

00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:44.742 region:rollup2
THEN NOT GETTING PAID ON TIME

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:46.810 region:rollup2
THAT THERE THAT THEY REALLY NEED

00:50:44.742 --> 00:50:49.046 region:rollup2
TO BE GETTING PAID ON TIME BUT

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.613 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT. WHERE THE LEAST ONE

00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:51.649 region:rollup2
MAYBE TWO?

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:52.650 region:rollup2
LAWSUITS MAKE MAYBE MORE ARE

00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:54.752 region:rollup2
ARE WITH.

A MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.924 region:rollup2
FOR UTILITY MOVEMENT AND THAT

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:01.525 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY HAD FIVE OR SIX

00:50:59.924 --> 00:51:02.893 region:rollup2
PARCELS THEY WERE ABLE TO.

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:04.194 region:rollup2
COMPLETE A COUPLE OF THEM HE DID

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:06.096 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE BALANCE

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:08.132 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:09.800 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT THEY HAVE.

00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:10.434 region:rollup2
UTILIZED ALL OF THEIR.

00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:28.218 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT COME

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:30.554 region:rollup2
CONNECTS BACK TO.

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:33.324 region:rollup2

THE ASSETS THAT THAT ARE

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:57.067 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BUT.

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:58.802 region:rollup2
YOU SAID EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TRADE

00:53:57.067 --> 00:54:00.471 region:rollup2
WILL QUOTE CRAP LABORS ARE OUT

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:02.306 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THE JOB TODAY A THAT

00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:04.241 region:rollup2
NUMBER WILL GROW AS WE GET IT

00:54:02.306 --> 00:54:06.009 region:rollup2
EXPANDED CONSTRUCTION SITES.

00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:07.411 region:rollup2
GOING TO FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:09.480 region:rollup2

STATE.

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:15.352 region:rollup2
AND I THINK BY ONE ESTIMATE

00:54:14.151 --> 00:54:16.053 region:rollup2
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE JOB

THIS PROJECT SO VERY PROUD OF

00:54:21.492 --> 00:54:24.361 region:rollup2
THAT AND THEN THINK THAT THERE'S

00:54:22.793 --> 00:54:26.430 region:rollup2
NO DOUBT IT IS HAD THIS GREAT

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:27.998 region:rollup2

.

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:53.784 region:rollup2
THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S VERY

00:55:52.416 --> 00:55:55.185 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINED IN.

00:55:53.784 --> 00:55:56.987 region:rollup2

THE ABILITY TO EXPAND. HIGHWAYS

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.925 region:rollup2
FURTHER IN SOME PLACES THE

HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES

00:59:56.927 --> 01:00:00.464 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLANS AS YOU MAY KNOW.

00:59:59.396 --> 01:00:03.033 region:rollup2
THE PEER REVIEW GROUP WAS

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:04.935 region:rollup2
CREATED AND PROPOSITION ONE A

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:06.903 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT OF

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.504 region:rollup2

BUT WE ALSO HAVE COMMENTED ON

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:17.447 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS THAT THE AUTHORITY

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:18.248 region:rollup2
IS DOING. THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.450 region:rollup2
BE OF INTEREST TO THE

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:22.352 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WE HAVE THUS FAR

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:24.321 region:rollup2
WRITTEN FIFTEEN LETTERS TO THE

LEGISLATURE ON ONE OR THE OTHER

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:28.391 region:rollup2
TOPICS MANY OF THE BUSINESS

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:30.126 region:rollup2
PLANS BUT. OTHER TOPICS THAT WE

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:31.261 region:rollup2
HAVE THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.996 region:rollup2
WE SENT A LETTER TO THE

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:35.298 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE COMMENTING ON THE

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:37.234 region:rollup2
DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.735 region:rollup2
PLAN ON MARCH THE THIRTIETH.

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:40.504 region:rollup2
I WANT TO SUMMARIZE YOUR

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:42.973 region:rollup2
COMMENTS HERE TODAY THEY FALL

01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:44.508 region:rollup2
INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE IS THE

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.775 region:rollup2
POLICY CHANGES.

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:47.043 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER OR SOME

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.577 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS THAT WE

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:49.746 region:rollup2
HAVE ON THE BUSINESS PLAN

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:51.748 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:53.149 region:rollup2
A POLICY ISSUES I BELIEVE ARE

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:54.918 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:56.987 region:rollup2
DETAIL COMMENT SO I WANT TO

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:58.555 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THEM FIRST.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:00.023 region:rollup2
THE GROUP BELIEVES THAT THE HIGH

01:00:58.555 --> 01:01:01.892 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL PROJECT HAS NOW

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:03.927 region:rollup2
REACHED A POINT WHERE DIFFICULT

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:05.862 region:rollup2
DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE ABOUT

01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:07.731 region:rollup2
THE PROJECTS FUTURE SCOPE IN

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:10.066 region:rollup2
FUNDING. QUITE SIMPLY.

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:11.701 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF COST INCREASES IN

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:13.436 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN FUNDING SOURCES.

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:14.938 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY CAN NO LONGER

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:16.940 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THE LINK FROM THE

01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:18.742 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY TO EITHER THE LA

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.610 region:rollup2
BASIN OR SAN JOSE AND THE

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:22.145 region:rollup2
PENINSULA.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:24.214 region:rollup2
THE US AS IT STANDS TODAY THERE

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:25.882 region:rollup2
IS LITTLE PROSPECT OF THE SYSTEM

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.817 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD GENERATE ENOUGH CASH

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:29.686 region:rollup2
FLOW. PICTURE HERE CONTRIBUTE TO

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:31.121 region:rollup2
FUTURE INVESTMENT.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:33.223 region:rollup2
THIS BILL LIMIT DOES NOT COME AS

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:34.624 region:rollup2
A SURPRISE IT HAPPENS NEARLY

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:36.960 region:rollup2
EVERY TIME WHEN WE TRY TO

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:38.128 region:rollup2
TRANSLATE A MEGA PROJECT FROM A

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.497 region:rollup2
GRAND VISION.

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:42.532 region:rollup2
INTO A WORKING SYSTEM AND IS NOT

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:44.000 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A REFLECTION ON THE

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.101 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE HER HONESTY OF THE

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.903 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO RUN THE

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:48.572 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:50.640 region:rollup2
THE CRITICAL QUESTION THOUGH IS

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:52.342 region:rollup2
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.611 region:rollup2
THE DRAFT PLAN DOESN'T REALLY

01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:55.946 region:rollup2
DISCUSS OPTIONS IN ADDRESSING

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:56.713 region:rollup2
THIS QUESTION OF MISTER

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:58.181 region:rollup2
PATTERSON YOU RAISED THIS

01:01:56.713 --> 01:02:00.116 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:01.551 region:rollup2
THE GROUP PLAYED OUT FOR VERY

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.953 region:rollup2
GENERAL OPTIONS IN OUR LETTER

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.721 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T PRETEND THAT THESE

01:02:02.953 --> 01:02:05.288 region:rollup2
ARE THE ONLY ONES ARE THAT

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.890 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COULDN'T COME UP WITH

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:08.925 region:rollup2
BETTER ONES.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.860 region:rollup2
THE FIRST OPTION IS WE COULD

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:11.861 region:rollup2
JUST STOP AND GO HOME PAYOFF

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.363 region:rollup2
WATER WE HAVE TO PAY OFF IT

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.764 region:rollup2
STOPPED.

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:15.265 region:rollup2
THE SECOND IS WE COULD COMPLETE

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:15.799 region:rollup2
THE WORK IN THE CENTRAL

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:18.068 region:rollup2
VALLEY-ALONG WITH WHATEVER

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:18.635 region:rollup2
CONTRACT

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.837 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS WE HAVE ON THE

01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:22.505 region:rollup2
BOOKENDS.

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:23.840 region:rollup2
THE THIRD WE COULD ADOPT WHAT IS

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.508 region:rollup2
IN EFFECT THE PROPOSAL IN THE

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.210 region:rollup2
DRAFT PLAN.

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:28.578 region:rollup2
ANNA ANNA CONNECTION TO GILROY

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.547 region:rollup2
IN BAKERSFIELD AND APPROVE THE

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:32.182 region:rollup2
LA UNION STATION WHILE AWAITING

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:33.984 region:rollup2
BETTER COMMAND OVER THE DESIGN

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:35.118 region:rollup2
AND COST OF BETRAY CHO PASSED

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:37.687 region:rollup2
PANELS.

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:39.022 region:rollup2
MORE FOURTH WE COULD RE COMMIT

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:40.624 region:rollup2
TO THE FULL PHASE ONE WITH THE

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:42.525 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT SUCH A

01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:44.861 region:rollup2
DECISION WOULD HAVE TO BE BASED

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:45.395 region:rollup2
ON ADOPTION OF A CREDIBLE LONG

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:47.631 region:rollup2
TERM. PLAN TO FINANCE THE

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:49.566 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:51.901 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:54.070 region:rollup2
SYSTEM COSTS MIGHT WELL COMMAND

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:55.839 region:rollup2
AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:58.375 region:rollup2
WE DON'T DO THE FIRST OPTION

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:59.542 region:rollup2
SIMPLY STOPPING AS CREDIBLE.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:01.244 region:rollup2
IT WOULD LEAVE CALIFORNIA WOULD

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:02.312 region:rollup2
NOTHING USEFUL AND THE STATE

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:04.080 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE TO PAY BACK THE

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:05.949 region:rollup2
FEDERAL MONEY.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.751 region:rollup2
THE SECOND OPTION STOPPING WITH

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:08.852 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL VALLEY PLUS THE

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:10.654 region:rollup2
EXISTING BOOKEND IMPROVEMENTS

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:11.821 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.922 region:rollup2
BUT IT WOULD ELIMINATE THAT IT

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:14.724 region:rollup2
WOULD IT WOULD LIMIT THE VALUE

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:16.393 region:rollup2
OF THE RESULT.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:18.795 region:rollup2
THE THIRD OPTION IS IN THE DRAFT

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:20.597 region:rollup2
PLAN. PROBABLY MAKES THE BEST OF

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.132 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING SITUATION

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:23.833 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN BRINGING NEAR TERM

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.968 region:rollup2
BENEFITS TO THE MILLIONS OF

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.836 region:rollup2
CURRENT PASSENGERS. ON THE

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:28.371 region:rollup2
BOOKENDS.

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:29.406 region:rollup2
BUT IT LEAVES THE STATE SHORT OF

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:31.474 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM THAT WILL BE ABLE TO

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:33.410 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO FINANCING OF THE

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.878 region:rollup2
REMAINDER OF THE SYSTEM.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:37.080 region:rollup2
THE FOURTH OPTION COMPLETING

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:38.314 region:rollup2
PHASE ONE AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.850 region:rollup2
MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:42.819 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE A. BUT CANNOT BE

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:45.055 region:rollup2
DONE WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:46.756 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS AND SOURCES.

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:48.758 region:rollup2
SIMPLY PUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:50.627 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS FAIR OR CREDIBLE ANY

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:53.029 region:rollup2
LONGER TO ASK MANAGEMENT TO

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:55.098 region:rollup2
DELIVER A LONG TERM PROJECT OF

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:56.166 region:rollup2
THIS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY. WITH

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:57.701 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF FUNDING BETTER

01:03:56.166 --> 01:04:00.670 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE IN TOTAL AND

01:03:57.701 --> 01:04:02.906 region:rollup2
UNRELIABLE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:05.308 region:rollup2
IF THE PROJECT IS TO GO AHEAD

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:06.810 region:rollup2
BEYOND ESSENTIALLY DISHONORABLE.

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:08.478 region:rollup2
THE STATE WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.012 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT IS UP TO

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:11.114 region:rollup2
THE TASK THIS IS NOT A NEW

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:14.117 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:04:11.114 --> 01:04:15.185 region:rollup2
IT WAS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FUNDING

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:17.554 region:rollup2
GAP OF SUCH AS LOVE. MISTER

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:19.589 region:rollup2
KELLY SAID AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:21.424 region:rollup2
IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:23.326 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT THERE WAS A GAP. THAT

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:24.728 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO BE FUNDED IN ORDER

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:26.730 region:rollup2
TO BUILD A SYSTEM TO THE POINT

01:04:24.728 --> 01:04:28.798 region:rollup2
WHERE IT COULD BEGIN TO GENERATE

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.933 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL INVESTMENT FROM THE

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:32.569 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:34.270 region:rollup2
WHAT IS NEW IS INCREASING SIZE

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:35.872 region:rollup2
OF THE GAP ALONG WITH THE CLEAR

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:37.340 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED TO

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:40.543 region:rollup2
MAKE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:41.311 region:rollup2
FUNDING STABLE AND PREDICTABLE?

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.113 region:rollup2
THEIR OBVIOUS WAYS TO FILL THE

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.947 region:rollup2
GAP

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:45.648 region:rollup2
INCREASED THE CAN'T SHARE OF CAP

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:47.550 region:rollup2
AND TRADE RECEIPTS GOING TO THE

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:49.385 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY. AND GUARANTEE THE

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.354 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES INCOME.

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:52.589 region:rollup2
A TAX ON FUELS OUR SALES TAX WAS

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:54.424 region:rollup2
PROPOSED IN THE TWO THOUSAND

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:55.759 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN.

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:58.161 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES THAT

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:58.762 region:rollup2
MIGHT EMERGE LIKE FUTURE FEDERAL

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:06.736 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAMS FEDERAL PROBLEM

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:08.171 region:rollup2
WILL NEED TO BE

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:09.305 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:10.874 region:rollup2
IF EVEN THE THIRD OPTION IS TO

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:12.976 region:rollup2
BE COMPLETED.

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:14.010 region:rollup2
IN PARALLEL WITH DEALING WITH

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:15.678 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR AN IMPROVED

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:18.314 region:rollup2
APPROACH THE FUNDING ESPECIALLY

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:19.783 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S ROLE BECAUSE THE

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:20.250 region:rollup2
STREETS ROLE IS LIKELY TO GROW.

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:21.818 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:25.121 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE RE VALIDATE THE

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:25.855 region:rollup2
PRIORITY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:26.823 region:rollup2
THE LIGHT OF THE COMPETING

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:29.092 region:rollup2
THEY'LL USE ELSEWHERE IN

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:37.567 region:rollup2

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:39.536 region:rollup2
WELL SUITED TO CARRY OUT FOR THE

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:49.879 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD INCLUDE INPUTS FROM

NEARLY OPERATOR WE HAVE

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:53.917 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED FOR MANY YEARS AND

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:55.852 region:rollup2
THE EARLY OPERATOR WOULD BE ABLE

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:59.989 region:rollup2
TO ADVISE THEM ON HOW TO BUILD

AND IT EXPLANATION OF THE

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:10.266 region:rollup2
BUSINESS MODEL.

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:11.968 region:rollup2
IT MAY LOOK LIKE THIS IS A

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:13.603 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT RIGHT NOW

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.737 region:rollup2
AND IT IS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:16.139 region:rollup2
IS LONG RANGE THEY'RE ACTUALLY

THEMSELVES IS NOT AT. ALL CLEAR

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:27.217 region:rollup2

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:28.418 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:29.853 region:rollup2
ON DEVELOPING DETAILED

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.621 region:rollup2

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:36.693 region:rollup2
THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE NOT

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:37.727 region:rollup2

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:38.561 region:rollup2
REALLY NO HOW'S IT GOING TO

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:40.063 region:rollup2

WORK TOGETHER.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.534 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO DEVELOP A LONG

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:45.969 region:rollup2
RANGE PROGRAM FOR ADDRESSING

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:48.938 region:rollup2
GREAT CROSS

01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:51.474 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE SECTION

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:52.542 region:rollup2

AND HIGH SPEED TRAINS DON'T MIX

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:01.551 region:rollup2
WITH GREAT PRICE.

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:02.685 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO CLARIFY THE

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:04.020 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM AS

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.555 region:rollup2

CALCULATIONS AND SCHEDULED

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:08.591 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE STRUCTURE OF THE

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:09.893 region:rollup2

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:11.761 region:rollup2
THEREFORE HOW WILL IT OPERATE

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:12.495 region:rollup2
AND FUTURE.

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.963 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO CONTINUE THE

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:15.598 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS ON SHOWING THEIR

PROJECTION AS RANGERS RATHER

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:19.369 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY. THERE IS NO POINT

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.905 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE THAT THE THERE'S A HIGH

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.840 region:rollup2

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:26.009 region:rollup2
ALL KINDS OF OUTCOMES IN BETWEEN

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:13.836 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION

01:16:12.535 --> 01:16:15.704 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. AND THE DRAFT PLAN

01:16:13.836 --> 01:16:17.106 region:rollup2
ASSUMES A FUND BECOMES AVAILABLE

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.574 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THOSE COSTS

01:16:17.106 --> 01:16:20.342 region:rollup2
WHILE THE PLANT IS NOT IDENTIFY

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:21.343 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC FUNDING SOURCES AND

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:23.179 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS IT DOES DISCUSS THE

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:25.548 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL OPTIONS INCLUDING A

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.182 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF FEDERAL SOURCES.

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:27.116 region:rollup2
WE'RE BORROWING AGAINST THE NET

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:32.321 region:rollup2
OPERATING REVENUES OF THE

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:33.656 region:rollup2
INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT.

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:34.990 region:rollup2
THE PLAN RAISES SEVERAL ISSUES

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:36.492 region:rollup2
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:38.394 region:rollup2
THE FIRST BEING THAT THE ACTUAL

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:38.994 region:rollup2
PROJECT COST COULD BE EVEN

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:40.663 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN THE SET FOR COST

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:41.931 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE INDICATES.

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:43.032 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING THE

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:44.166 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY NOW INTRODUCES COSTS

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:45.367 region:rollup2
ANY RANGING THAT IS AN

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:47.102 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IN THIS PLAN IS MORE

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:48.838 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT ON THE FULL

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:50.573 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION.

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:54.410 region:rollup2
IT DOES MEAN HOWEVER THAT.

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:55.644 region:rollup2
PHASE ONE COULD COST AS MUCH AS

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.378 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:57.480 region:rollup2
HAS PUT THE SEVENTY SEVEN

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:58.447 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CENTRAL

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.948 region:rollup2
COST ESTIMATE.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:16:59.982 region:rollup2
SECOND THERE SIGNIFICANT

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:02.351 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING FUNDING

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:02.985 region:rollup2
TO COMPLETE THE IOS.

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.986 region:rollup2
A LARGE PORTION OF THE FUNDING

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.820 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED FOR THAT PROJECT

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:06.622 region:rollup2
WOULD COME FROM BORROWING

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.256 region:rollup2
AGAINST FUTURE CAP AND TRADE

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.190 region:rollup2
AUCTION REVENUES THROUGH TWENTY

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:09.158 region:rollup2
FIFTY.

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.292 region:rollup2
THE US WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:11.927 region:rollup2
ACTION TO EXTEND THE CAP AND

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.828 region:rollup2
TRADE PROGRAM.

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:15.431 region:rollup2
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THOSE FUNDS

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:16.298 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AVAILABLE.

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:17.266 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEVEL OF

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:19.135 region:rollup2
OXEN REVENUES ASSUMED IN THE

01:17:17.266 --> 01:17:20.336 region:rollup2
DRAFT PLAN DO NOT MATERIALIZE

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:22.171 region:rollup2
WERE THE PROJECTS COSTS ARE MUCH

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:23.472 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED.

01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:25.040 region:rollup2
THE STATE WOULD ALSO NEED TO

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:31.247 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY OTHER FUNDS WERE TO TO

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:32.781 region:rollup2
HELP FINANCE THE I WAS INCLUDING

01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:33.582 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY THE GENERAL FUND.

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:34.683 region:rollup2
THIRD THERE'S NO COMPLETE

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:35.818 region:rollup2
FUNDING PLAN FOR THE REMAINDER

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:37.086 region:rollup2
OF FEES ONE WHILE THE PLAN

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:37.620 region:rollup2
DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:38.354 region:rollup2
SECURE TYPE THING THE NET

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.955 region:rollup2
OPERATING REVENUES OF THE

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:40.556 region:rollup2
INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT. THERE

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.257 region:rollup2
ARE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES THIS

01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:42.291 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:42.791 region:rollup2
FIRST IT'S UNCLEAR THAT INITIAL

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.860 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WILL GENERATE AN

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:46.529 region:rollup2
OPERATING SURPLUS.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.263 region:rollup2
SECOND YOU FORTUITOUS PIZZA

01:17:46.529 --> 01:17:47.796 region:rollup2
SECURITIZED IN THE NECK CASH

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:49.965 region:rollup2
FLOW WOULD MAKE ADDITIONAL

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:51.567 region:rollup2
FUNDING AVAILABLE NO SOONER THAN

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:52.868 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY TWO. EVEN THOUGH

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:55.871 region:rollup2
FUNDS WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:56.939 region:rollup2
EARLIER TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE BY

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:58.107 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY THREE AT THE SUIT.

01:17:56.939 --> 01:17:59.241 region:rollup2
THIRD THE PLAN ESTIMATES THAT

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.442 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT CAN

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:02.144 region:rollup2
BE GENERATED WOULD FALL

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.912 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY SHORT OF THE LEVEL

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:05.314 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:06.782 region:rollup2
DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY

01:18:05.314 --> 01:18:08.217 region:rollup2
HOW THAT SHORTFALL.

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:11.120 region:rollup2
BE THAT.

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:12.288 region:rollup2
IF YOU OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE OUR

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.922 region:rollup2
FOURTH ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATIONS

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:15.524 region:rollup2
MORNING IS THAT IF WILL FUNDING

01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:16.926 region:rollup2
PLAN. IS CRUCIAL FOR THE HIGH

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.927 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL PROJECT SUCCESS

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:18.494 region:rollup2
AND AT THIS TIME IT COMPLETE

01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:20.763 region:rollup2
VITAL FUNDING PLAN DOES NOT

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:25.167 region:rollup2
EXIST.

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:26.702 region:rollup2
HAPPY DAY ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS.

I WANNA VISIT THAT THAT THE

AND I'M READING FROM THE PLAN.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:45.754 region:rollup2
.

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.388 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT THE LEGISLATURE FROM

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:47.690 region:rollup2
RESTRICTING RE DISTRIBUTING OR

THIRTY YEARS.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:53.696 region:rollup2
EXTENSION OF THE CAP AND TRADE

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:54.997 region:rollup2

AND GUARANTEE THAT THE

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:57.967 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WILL BACK FEEL ANY

01:18:56.599 --> 01:19:01.604 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE IF CAP AND TRADE

01:18:57.967 --> 01:19:01.870 region:rollup2
AUCTIONS BRING IN LESS REVENUE.

01:19:01.604 --> 01:19:02.004 region:rollup2
ARE THEN.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:03.539 region:rollup2
.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:05.741 region:rollup2
PROJECTED.

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:07.610 region:rollup2
EARLIER AYE AYE AYE QUESTIONED

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:09.979 region:rollup2
NO. WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:11.447 region:rollup2
VIABILITY OF DOING THIS WITHOUT.

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:13.515 region:rollup2
THEY VOTE OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:14.917 region:rollup2
OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:17.419 region:rollup2
ADVICE PARTICULARLY THAT.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:18.053 region:rollup2
.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.655 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THE PEOPLE GOING TO BE

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:21.657 region:rollup2
REQUIRED.

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:22.491 region:rollup2
WHO FUTURE LOOK BUT THE

01:19:21.657 --> 01:19:23.959 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO COMMIT CRIMES OR

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:25.060 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT?

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:27.429 region:rollup2
A FUTURE LEGISLATURE FROM

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:29.765 region:rollup2
CHANGING AND AN APPROPRIATION.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:31.100 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:33.335 region:rollup2
FINANCE PLAN WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:36.138 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:37.206 region:rollup2
IS IS I THINK VERY MUCH IF.

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:37.706 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING TO

01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:39.775 region:rollup2
REQUIRE.

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:40.609 region:rollup2
.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.744 region:rollup2
BUT A VOTE BECAUSE THE

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.078 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION I THINK IT'S PRETTY

01:19:41.744 --> 01:19:44.947 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT YOU YOU JUST CAN'T DO

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.648 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:47.483 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT.

01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:48.684 region:rollup2
LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE THE

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:50.719 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OVER A LONG PERIOD

01:19:48.684 --> 01:19:52.187 region:rollup2
OF TIME.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:55.090 region:rollup2
DO YOU CONCUR THAT THAT

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:56.425 region:rollup2
FINANCING PLAN DOES HAVE A.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.892 region:rollup2
AND ELEMENT TO IT THAT'S GOING

01:19:56.425 --> 01:20:00.929 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE OF A VOTER

01:19:56.892 --> 01:20:01.997 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT.

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:04.366 region:rollup2
IT COMES DOWN TO THE SPECIFICS

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:07.136 region:rollup2
OF THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL.

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:07.803 region:rollup2
PACKAGE AND WE HAVEN'T CONFERRED

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:08.337 region:rollup2
WITH COUNSEL THIS TIME SOME NOT

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.405 region:rollup2
POSITION GIVE A DEFINITIVE

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:10.339 region:rollup2
ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT IT

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:11.407 region:rollup2
WOULD CERTAINLY DEPEND ON ON THE

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:12.775 region:rollup2
DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:14.943 region:rollup2
FINANCING. IT'S NOT

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:16.078 region:rollup2
INCONCEIVABLE THAT IT WOULD BUT

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:17.613 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED WITHOUT

01:20:16.078 --> 01:20:19.114 region:rollup2
CONFERRING WITH COUNSEL IT CAN'T

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.348 region:rollup2
SEE ANYMORE. WITH RESPECT TO

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:20.449 region:rollup2
USING.

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:22.685 region:rollup2
IN CAP AND TRADE REVENUE OVER

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:24.453 region:rollup2
AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:26.255 region:rollup2
.

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:27.823 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THE PRESUMPTION WITH

01:20:26.255 --> 01:20:29.525 region:rollup2
RESPECT A CAP AND TRADE THAT

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:31.126 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THAT IT WAS GOING TO

01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:32.995 region:rollup2
DECLINE OVER TIME AS.

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:34.296 region:rollup2
THE THE REQUIREMENT TO THE

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.698 region:rollup2
PURCHASE AND AND TRADE THESE.

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:38.701 region:rollup2
.

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:40.402 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES WILL IN FACT CHANGE

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:43.305 region:rollup2
OF BEHAVIOR AND THAT.

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:44.506 region:rollup2
CO TWO WOULD IN FACT DECLINE

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:47.009 region:rollup2
OVER TIME AND THAT.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:49.611 region:rollup2
BUT ULTIMATELY.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:50.446 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE SHOULD FULFILL ITS

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:52.981 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:54.049 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS ON ESSENTIALLY AT

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:55.117 region:rollup2
SOMEPLACE GO AWAY.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:57.186 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'RE

01:20:55.117 --> 01:20:57.820 region:rollup2
ASKING.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:59.988 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INVESTMENT PEOPLE THE

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:02.491 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITERS.

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:04.660 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A SIGNIFICANT RISK WITH

01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:06.328 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF FINANCING.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:09.098 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE IS A.

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:12.835 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEAR BOND REQUIREMENT.

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:13.769 region:rollup2
WITH A FLATTENING OR DECLINING.

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:15.170 region:rollup2
STREAM OF REVENUE TO PAY

01:21:13.769 --> 01:21:18.207 region:rollup2
PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:19.908 region:rollup2
THAT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:21.377 region:rollup2
TO BE A.

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:23.345 region:rollup2
STREAM OF REVENUE THAT CANNOT BE

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.880 region:rollup2
COUNTED ON OVER TIME.

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:26.148 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU CONCUR WITH THAT IS

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:31.653 region:rollup2
THAT A RISK FACTOR IN THIS KIND

01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:33.222 region:rollup2
OF FINANCING.

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:34.690 region:rollup2
CROSS BROWN WITH THE LA EL

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.524 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN A MEMBER PATTERSON

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:36.291 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THERE IS.

01:21:35.524 --> 01:21:38.394 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:39.395 region:rollup2
AROUND FUTURE CAP AND TRADE

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:42.064 region:rollup2
REVENUES WE'VE DONE SOME LOOKS

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:42.731 region:rollup2
OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY BUT

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.399 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE EVEN LOOKING

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.134 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT THERE'S EVEN GREATER

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:50.706 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THAT

01:21:45.134 --> 01:21:52.775 region:rollup2
REVENUE STREAM WOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:21:50.706 --> 01:21:53.409 region:rollup2
I THINK ARGUE AT LEAST IN THE

01:21:52.775 --> 01:21:55.511 region:rollup2
MEDIUM TERM IT'S NOT ENTIRELY

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:56.145 region:rollup2
CLEAR ON THE LONG TERM BUT IN

01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:57.513 region:rollup2
THE MEDIUM TERM THERE A COUPLE

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:59.314 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT COULD.

01:21:57.513 --> 01:22:01.216 region:rollup2
AFFECT THE REVENUE SOME OF THEM

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:02.951 region:rollup2
HAVE SORT OF A.

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:05.087 region:rollup2
DOWNWARD PUSH ON THE MATTER

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:06.655 region:rollup2
REVENUE AS YOU MENTIONED THE

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:11.260 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES PERHAPS

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:12.761 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SOLD IS DECREASING.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.729 region:rollup2
THAT'S OFFSET AND TO SOME EXTENT

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.597 region:rollup2
IT MAY BE EVEN MORE THAN OFFSET

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:18.434 region:rollup2
BY POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:25.974 region:rollup2
PRICES OF THOSE ALLOWANCES. SO

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:29.211 region:rollup2
LEAST THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY YOU

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:29.645 region:rollup2
CAN SORT OF SEE WHERE THOSE

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:32.114 region:rollup2
MIGHT.

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:33.849 region:rollup2
BALANCE EACH OTHER OUT AND SO

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:36.452 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT A

01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:37.085 region:rollup2
DECLINE IN REVENUE STREAM. BUT

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:44.393 region:rollup2
YOUR POINT ABOUT BUT I BUT ALSO

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:46.428 region:rollup2
IT IS IT.

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:47.262 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T IT BE TRUE THAT ANY

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:48.530 region:rollup2
EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE WILL

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:49.631 region:rollup2
HAVE TO REACH THE TWO THIRDS

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:55.170 region:rollup2
VOTE THRESHOLD NOT MERELY A

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:57.072 region:rollup2
MAJORITY VOTE.

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:57.873 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT SURE WE COULD SORT

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:59.007 region:rollup2
SAY WITH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT

01:22:57.873 --> 01:23:00.209 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY I THINK AT THE VERY

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:01.410 region:rollup2
LEAST F.

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:03.378 region:rollup2
AN EXTENSION WERE APPROVED WITH

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:06.048 region:rollup2
A MAJORITY VOTE THAT WOULD BE A

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:08.617 region:rollup2
LOT OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY AROUND.

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:09.518 region:rollup2
YET THE ABILITY TO DO THAT IN

01:23:08.617 --> 01:23:10.853 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM AND SO YOUNG AND

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:13.155 region:rollup2
THAT CREATES POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

01:23:10.853 --> 01:23:15.290 region:rollup2
FOR TRYING TO FINANCE BASED ON

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:18.160 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:19.361 region:rollup2
SO YOUNG THAT I THINK THAT'S A

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.862 region:rollup2
LEGAL QUESTION THERE WHERE

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:23.465 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT HER PRESENT

01:23:19.862 --> 01:23:24.333 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY BUT CERTAINLY TWO

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:25.601 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE WOULD.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.468 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A LOT MORE UNCERTAINTY

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.236 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FUTURE PROGRAM AND

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:29.104 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'M I'M I'M BASICALLY

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:30.472 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS.

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:31.073 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE VIABILITY OF A

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:31.874 region:rollup2
FINANCE PLAN THAT HAS THESE

01:23:31.073 --> 01:23:33.075 region:rollup2
KINDS OF UNCERTAINTIES. AND

01:23:31.874 --> 01:23:34.009 region:rollup2
THOSE KINDS OF UNCERTAINTIES

01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:35.811 region:rollup2
INVESTORS GOING TO KNOW ABOUT

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.478 region:rollup2
AND THE RATING AGENCIES ARE

01:23:35.811 --> 01:23:37.145 region:rollup2
GOING TO KNOW ABOUT THIS AND YOU

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:37.479 region:rollup2
YOU JUST CAN'T HIDE THIS KIND OF

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:38.380 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY.

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:41.416 region:rollup2
AND SO I DO THINK IT'S A RATHER

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:42.184 region:rollup2
DUBIOUS APPROACH.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:42.551 region:rollup2
TO THE BIG PICTURE FINANCE AND

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:43.352 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK.

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:44.720 region:rollup2
.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:47.122 region:rollup2
IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED HERE.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.657 region:rollup2
THAT SOONER OR LATER THIS

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:50.292 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO DECIDE

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:51.727 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S GOING TO FULLY FUND

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:53.362 region:rollup2
THIS OR WHETHER IT IS NOT.

01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:54.997 region:rollup2
AND THAT I BELIEVE IS GOING TO

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:57.299 region:rollup2
REQUIRE A A A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE

01:23:54.997 --> 01:23:59.301 region:rollup2
WE COMMITTED TO CERTAIN THINGS

01:23:57.299 --> 01:24:01.036 region:rollup2
AND CERTAIN. TIMELINE CERTAIN

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:02.771 region:rollup2
SPEED CERTAIN COSTS.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:05.073 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO REALLY.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:05.841 region:rollup2
A.

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:09.912 region:rollup2
PUT MONEY WHERE ARE OUR OUR

01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:12.114 region:rollup2
MOUTH IS IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE.

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:13.615 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ACTION BY THE THE BUT AT

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:14.249 region:rollup2
AND THE AND THE PEOPLE STATE

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:16.118 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA GOING HAVE TO WEIGH

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:18.754 region:rollup2
IN ON THAT DAY. THEY WERE THEY

01:24:16.118 --> 01:24:19.388 region:rollup2
VOTED ON THIS INITIALLY.

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:20.923 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:22.758 region:rollup2
MAKE.

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:24.526 region:rollup2
HUGE AND CAN AT AND AND AND DEEP

01:24:22.758 --> 01:24:26.295 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN HOW IT'S FINANCED.

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:27.629 region:rollup2
A AND THE RISK FACTORS INVOLVED

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:29.831 region:rollup2
IN IT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THE

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:30.966 region:rollup2
SAME KIND OF TRANSPARENCY OPEN

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:31.767 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL TO THE

01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:33.101 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION DEBATE AND I THINK A

01:24:31.767 --> 01:24:34.202 region:rollup2
VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.370 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WHICH I THINK WE SHOULD

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:36.939 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP OUGHT TO REALLY

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.639 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS IN A

01:24:36.939 --> 01:24:39.675 region:rollup2
SERIOUS SERIOUS PLACE.

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:41.176 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:43.512 region:rollup2
ASKING THE VOTERS.

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:45.280 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

01:24:43.512 --> 01:24:46.582 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT BUILDING WHAT WE WE

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.083 region:rollup2
SAID WE WERE GOING TO BILL IT

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:50.018 region:rollup2
ISN'T GOING TO.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:51.820 region:rollup2
PRODUCE THE SPEEDS THE TIME.

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:53.956 region:rollup2
THE COSTS ARE.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.023 region:rollup2
VERY EXCESSIVE AND HERE'S HOW

01:24:53.956 --> 01:24:56.592 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING HAVE TO FUND I THINK

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:58.226 region:rollup2
WE OWE TO THE PEOPLE TO ASK THEM

01:24:56.592 --> 01:25:01.063 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:02.364 region:rollup2
UNDER THESE. WITH THESE COSTS

01:25:01.063 --> 01:25:03.999 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T WE ASK THE PERMISSION

01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:05.200 region:rollup2
A AT THE BALLOT BOX IF WE'RE

01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:06.468 region:rollup2
GOING TO CHANGE A HUGE

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.036 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DATA.

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:10.005 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT OF GENERAL FUND MONEY

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:15.944 region:rollup2
OR OR A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND

01:25:10.005 --> 01:25:17.312 region:rollup2
MONEY FOR FOR THESE PURPOSES.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.647 region:rollup2
MISSION THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:20.248 region:rollup2
MISTER PASS AND THEY ASK FOR A

01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:20.716 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION FROM YOU MISTER

DID YOU INDICATE THAT THERE'S A

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:25.687 region:rollup2
WRITTEN OPINION FROM.

.

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:28.824 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S.

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:29.958 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY NOT.

01:25:28.824 --> 01:25:30.626 region:rollup2
IT'S IT AT.

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:31.693 region:rollup2
THE OPINION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO US

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.294 region:rollup2
INFORMALLY.

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:32.594 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE ASKING THAT IT BE.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:33.795 region:rollup2
FORMALIZED.

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:35.330 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:37.232 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST THIS.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:39.134 region:rollup2
ASK.

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:40.669 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.303 region:rollup2
ASK OUR LEGAL COUNSEL ABOUT AT

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:41.670 region:rollup2
DON'T THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE SAME

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:44.506 region:rollup2
ANSWER THAT THEY

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:46.408 region:rollup2
TO US.

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:48.844 region:rollup2
I WILL BE SURE TO DO THAT.

01:25:46.408 --> 01:25:51.380 region:rollup2
UPON.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:52.648 region:rollup2
I OPTED.

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:54.282 region:rollup2
I THINK IF WE JUST WERE I I

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.384 region:rollup2
GUESS MY MY FOCUS I GUESS IS TO

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:56.585 region:rollup2
TRY TO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:59.054 region:rollup2
FOR ALL OF US OPERATE ON THE

01:25:56.585 --> 01:26:00.889 region:rollup2
SAME INFORMATION. SO I'M HEARING

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:04.226 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE GAP IN THE FUNDING

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:05.961 region:rollup2
GAP HAS GROWN OVER OVER TIME

01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:10.666 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE CURRENT FUNDING GAP.

01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:11.233 region:rollup2
IF IF.

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.267 region:rollup2
TO TALK TO THE LA HOW COULD

01:26:11.233 --> 01:26:14.236 region:rollup2
ANSWER THAT.

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:16.304 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE HAVE NOW

01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:19.408 region:rollup2
AND HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE NEED?

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:21.376 region:rollup2
YET SO.

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:22.878 region:rollup2
OUR LOOK AT THE.

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:24.780 region:rollup2
PRESENTLY AVAILABLE REVENUE

01:26:22.878 --> 01:26:25.681 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED THE AUTHORITY MIGHT

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.115 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEONE WORTH OF TWENTY ONE

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:28.817 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:30.052 region:rollup2
THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY IF YOU IF

01:26:28.817 --> 01:26:32.054 region:rollup2
YOU INCLUDE CAPTURED REVENUES AT

01:26:30.052 --> 01:26:33.355 region:rollup2
THEIR. DESTINATION ABOUT SEVEN

YEAR THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY.

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:40.262 region:rollup2
THIRD POINT THIRTY AT.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.663 region:rollup2
TO FUND CONSTRUCTION OF INITIAL

01:26:40.262 --> 01:26:43.999 region:rollup2
OPERATING SEGMENT AS YOU SEE THE

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:45.333 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN THE EXPECTED

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:45.867 region:rollup2
CAPITAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION IS

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:46.902 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO THIRTY

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:47.469 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:26:46.902 --> 01:26:47.836 region:rollup2
SO I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH A

01:26:47.469 --> 01:26:51.506 region:rollup2
FUNDING GAP OF.

BILLION PETER I DON'T I GET YOU

RIGHT NOW OF THE TWO TO TWENTY

01:26:55.477 --> 01:26:58.146 region:rollup2
THIRTY IDENTIFIED IDENTIFY

AUTHORITY.

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:03.018 region:rollup2

01:27:03.018 --> 01:27:05.987 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT BILLION THAT'S

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:07.522 region:rollup2
REALLY WHOLE FEES ONE CORRECT

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:09.324 region:rollup2
PHASE ONE ALRIGHT SO THEY HAVE

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:10.392 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS NOW.

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:12.027 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THE WHOLE COSTS IS ANY

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:14.362 region:rollup2
SEVEN TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION.

01:27:12.027 --> 01:27:16.331 region:rollup2
SO THE SO THE DELTA IS LARGER.

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:18.033 region:rollup2
THAT EIGHT BILLION IT'S.

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:20.235 region:rollup2
THE SIX

01:27:18.033 --> 01:27:22.637 region:rollup2
IF I AM FIFTY SIX BILLION TO.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:26.108 region:rollup2
.

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:28.143 region:rollup2
SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION.

01:27:26.108 --> 01:27:30.045 region:rollup2
YES I WAS AFRAID TO TALK PRETTY

01:27:28.143 --> 01:27:31.780 region:rollup2
SEGMENT NOTHING. SO THE SO THE

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:32.881 region:rollup2
INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT JUST

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:33.748 region:rollup2
TO GET IT DONE IS EIGHT BILLION.

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:35.484 region:rollup2
BUT DON'T TO FINISH THE WHOLE

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:36.084 region:rollup2
THING IT'S FIFTY SIX TO SEVEN

01:27:35.484 --> 01:27:37.018 region:rollup2
SEVEN DIED THAT'S RIGHT IS

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.987 region:rollup2
MISTER KELLY INDICATED THAT'S

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:41.423 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY THE IDENTIFY POSSIBLE TO

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:42.724 region:rollup2
TAKE A PASS.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:44.593 region:rollup2
TOTALING SEGMENT AND SO YEAH BUT

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:45.260 region:rollup2
IT WOULD TAKE A PASS AS THAT

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:46.628 region:rollup2
ABOUT MONEY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:49.097 region:rollup2
THAT'S MISSING.

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:49.931 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT.

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:52.934 region:rollup2
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE PROJECT

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:54.436 region:rollup2
A PASSING A COST.

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.904 region:rollup2
THERE IT CENTER COST ESTIMATES

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:56.538 region:rollup2
ARE SOMEWHERE IN THAT BALLPARK

01:27:55.904 --> 01:27:58.440 region:rollup2
AROUND A BILLION BUT I DEFERRED

01:27:56.538 --> 01:27:58.740 region:rollup2
VIEW FORTY TO GIVE YOU A BETTER

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.242 region:rollup2
NUMBER. OF.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:02.944 region:rollup2
SO.

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:04.946 region:rollup2
SO IF I WAS GONNA IF IF.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:07.015 region:rollup2
TO THE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:08.283 region:rollup2
WE NEED SAID THAT THE SIX OR

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:10.519 region:rollup2
SEVEN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:12.487 region:rollup2
FINISH THIS WHOLE PROJECT.

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:13.922 region:rollup2
WHAT WITH WITH UNDERSTANDING

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:15.190 region:rollup2
STIPULATING THAT THE AT THE

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:17.626 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY HAS IDENTIFIED TWENTY

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:18.660 region:rollup2
ONE BILLION DOLLARS?

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:21.296 region:rollup2
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:22.864 region:rollup2
AND THEN IN.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.798 region:rollup2
TO TO MISTER THOMPSON YOU YOU

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:23.965 region:rollup2
YOU SPOKE TO SOMETHING THAT PART

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:26.134 region:rollup2
BY.

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:27.802 region:rollup2
.

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:29.805 region:rollup2
I GUESS THAT I DIDN'T ADDED KNOW

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:31.373 region:rollup2
THIS BUT YOU MENTIONED BEFORE

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:33.742 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE PREVIOUS BUSINESS

01:28:31.373 --> 01:28:35.811 region:rollup2
PLAN THERE WAS THAT. THERE WAS

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:37.045 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION OF A SALES TAX OR

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:38.680 region:rollup2
TAX ON FUELS.

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:40.148 region:rollup2
TO FINISH THIS PROJECT CAN YOU

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.184 region:rollup2
ELABORATE ON THAT THE TWO

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:44.219 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DISMISS PLAN

01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:45.820 region:rollup2
FIRST ONE ó WAS TO BE FINANCED

01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:47.122 region:rollup2
WITH THE SALES TAX.

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:49.391 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS EVER

01:28:47.122 --> 01:28:50.959 region:rollup2
MENTIONED A SALES TAX ON FUELS

01:28:49.391 --> 01:28:52.894 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF THE BUSINESS PLAN

01:28:50.959 --> 01:28:53.995 region:rollup2
OKAY BUT YOU YOU YOU IDENTIFIED

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:55.797 region:rollup2
AS A POTENTIAL LONG TERM REVENUE

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:58.099 region:rollup2
STREAM.

01:28:55.797 --> 01:29:00.435 region:rollup2
AMONG A LOT OF OTHERS OKAY.

01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:00.802 region:rollup2
WELL IT RIGHT FEDERAL FEDERAL

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:04.306 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO MEET.

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:04.606 region:rollup2
.

01:29:04.306 --> 01:29:07.008 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

01:29:04.606 --> 01:29:11.346 region:rollup2
.

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:12.314 region:rollup2
I GUESS IF IF IF THE GAP IS.

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:12.948 region:rollup2
IF THE DELTA IS FIFTY SIX

01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:13.849 region:rollup2
SENATOR BILLION.

01:29:12.948 --> 01:29:14.683 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO COMPLETE FUNDING

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:16.685 region:rollup2
PLAN NOW.

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:18.620 region:rollup2
.

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:19.120 region:rollup2
AS YOU INDICATED IN ON PAGE

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.721 region:rollup2
EIGHT OF YOUR ANALYSIS.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:22.691 region:rollup2
.

01:29:19.721 --> 01:29:23.325 region:rollup2
THEN IT.

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.826 region:rollup2
THEN HOW SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE

01:29:23.325 --> 01:29:29.264 region:rollup2
PERSON.

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:30.432 region:rollup2
AND AND ASSESSING THIS PROJECT.

01:29:29.264 --> 01:29:31.900 region:rollup2
BUT THE QUESTION FOR THE

01:29:30.432 --> 01:29:33.235 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DECIDED THERE MANY

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:35.770 region:rollup2
OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU IS

01:29:33.235 --> 01:29:37.906 region:rollup2
THERE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AS.

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:38.506 region:rollup2
YOUR THOUGHTS NEGATED. BAD FOR

01:29:37.906 --> 01:29:40.775 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT SPRING TO MIND

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:42.143 region:rollup2
INCLUDE GOING INTO THE PROJECT.

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:43.912 region:rollup2
BUT TRICKING THE SCOPE OF THE

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:44.846 region:rollup2
PROJECT PURSUING THAT.

01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:46.781 region:rollup2
PROJECT AS IDENTIFIED IN THE

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:48.717 region:rollup2
DRAFT EIGHTEEN PLANNER FUNNY WAY

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:49.784 region:rollup2
TO COMMIT SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:51.453 region:rollup2
COMPLETED THROUGH TO THE END OF

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:51.987 region:rollup2
PHASE ONE AND.

01:29:51.453 --> 01:29:52.988 region:rollup2
A VARIETY OF OPTIONS ARE

01:29:51.987 --> 01:29:54.389 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IN THAT RESPECT AS

01:29:52.988 --> 01:29:56.358 region:rollup2
WELL INCLUDING ADDITIONAL

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:57.993 region:rollup2
DEDICATED TAXATION REVENUES.

01:29:56.358 --> 01:29:59.394 region:rollup2
EXPAND OUTREACH ALLOCATION TO

01:29:57.993 --> 01:30:01.096 region:rollup2
THE PROJECTS ADDITIONAL BONDING

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:02.497 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY WERE ALLOCATING

01:30:01.096 --> 01:30:04.332 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND MONIES TO TO

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:06.001 region:rollup2
PROJECT OKAY BUT IN TERMS OF

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:06.568 region:rollup2
WHAT THE AS OUTLINED IN THE JEFF

01:30:06.001 --> 01:30:08.203 region:rollup2
THIS IS PLANNED.

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:10.438 region:rollup2
AS I IF I'M UNDERSTANDING

01:30:08.203 --> 01:30:13.275 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY EVEN BONDING AGAINST

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:15.577 region:rollup2
UNCERTAIN A CAP AND TRADE

01:30:13.275 --> 01:30:17.178 region:rollup2
REVENUE STREAM THAT. EVENT JACK

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:19.914 region:rollup2
CREATES EVEN MORE UNCERTAINTY

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:21.449 region:rollup2
RIGHT EVER IF IF IF WARY BUT IF

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:22.350 region:rollup2
WE ARE FORCED TO LOOK AT THE

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.118 region:rollup2
DRAFT IS HIS PLAN.

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.319 region:rollup2
IF IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING

01:30:23.118 --> 01:30:27.088 region:rollup2
CORRECT IS THAT IS THAT THE

01:30:24.319 --> 01:30:29.024 region:rollup2
CREDIT THE CORRECT ASSESSMENT.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:29.457 region:rollup2
I'M NOT QUITE SURE

01:30:29.024 --> 01:30:31.393 region:rollup2
SURE.

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:33.061 region:rollup2
I I MEAN I THINK CERTAINLY

01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:33.962 region:rollup2
THERE THERE'S NO AS AS WE

01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:34.996 region:rollup2
DISCUSS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:30:33.962 --> 01:30:36.598 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY AROUND FUTURE CAP

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:38.400 region:rollup2
AND TRADE REVENUES. THEIR

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:39.534 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL WAYS TO STRUCTURE IT

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.236 region:rollup2
WHERE PERHAPS THERE'S A LITTLE

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:42.103 region:rollup2
BIT LESS UNCERTAINTY FOR THE

01:30:41.236 --> 01:30:43.605 region:rollup2
PIECE THAT WOULD MAYBE GOT HIGH

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:46.141 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL FOR EXAMPLE RATHER

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:46.708 region:rollup2
THAN THE. PERCENTAGES A FIXED

01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:48.510 region:rollup2
AMOUNT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:51.880 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:53.548 region:rollup2
YET CAP AND TRADE IS IS ANYA AS

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.483 region:rollup2
IT STANDS RIGHT NOW IS IS

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:55.850 region:rollup2
UNCERTAIN.

01:30:55.483 --> 01:30:56.651 region:rollup2
FORMA REVENUE.

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:58.019 region:rollup2
IN.

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:59.421 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF THE.

01:30:58.019 --> 01:31:01.289 region:rollup2
THE LOOKED A BUSINESS PLAN AND

01:30:59.421 --> 01:31:02.857 region:rollup2
IF I LOOK AT THE FOUR OPTIONS.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.726 region:rollup2
BUT OUTLINED BY THAT PEER REVIEW

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:05.527 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON A PATH.

01:31:04.726 --> 01:31:07.262 region:rollup2
TO CREATE TWO SEGMENTS THAT

01:31:05.527 --> 01:31:08.396 region:rollup2
DON'T CONNECT

01:31:07.262 --> 01:31:09.230 region:rollup2
AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE IT'S OF

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:09.831 region:rollup2
THE BECAUSE A FUND OF THE

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:12.167 region:rollup2
FUNDING GAP IS THAT CORRECT.

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:13.735 region:rollup2
YES.

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:15.236 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE

01:31:13.735 --> 01:31:17.339 region:rollup2
SPEEDS BECAUSE OF THE BLENDED

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:18.807 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. THERE ARE CERTAIN PORT

01:31:17.339 --> 01:31:20.408 region:rollup2
PARTS PORTIONS OF THE HIGH SPEED

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:20.942 region:rollup2
RAIL SYSTEM THAT WON'T BE AS

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:26.247 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED.

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:27.515 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:29.551 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT PLANS WOULD BE

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:31.386 region:rollup2
EXPAND IN AFFECTED CALTRAIN

01:31:29.551 --> 01:31:33.154 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO GILROY THAT SECTION

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:34.222 region:rollup2
FROM SAN JOSE TO GILROY WOULD BE

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:36.358 region:rollup2
OPERATED AT A HUNDRED AND TEN

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:37.826 region:rollup2
MILES AN HOUR.

01:31:36.358 --> 01:31:42.364 region:rollup2
SOME HIGHER SPEED YES OKAY THANK

SOME COMMENTS.

01:56:56.076 --> 01:56:57.878 region:rollup2
YEAH PUDDLE THIS KEY WITH THE LA

01:56:57.711 --> 01:57:00.213 region:rollup2
SO.

01:56:57.878 --> 01:57:02.182 region:rollup2
UNDER SB ONE A LOT OF THE

01:57:00.213 --> 01:57:04.017 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS ALLOCATED PURSUANT TO

01:57:02.182 --> 01:57:05.385 region:rollup2
FORMULAS TO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

01:57:04.017 --> 01:57:07.087 region:rollup2
ON BUT THERE'S ONE. THREE OF

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:08.688 region:rollup2
PART OF OF FUNDING THAT SUBJECT

01:57:07.087 --> 01:57:10.524 region:rollup2
TO THE BUDGET ACT AND THAT'S HOW

01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:11.758 region:rollup2
YOU ALLOCATE FUNDING BETWEEN.

01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:13.827 region:rollup2
THE HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

01:57:11.758 --> 01:57:15.262 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE SHOP PROGRAM THE

01:57:13.827 --> 01:57:16.897 region:rollup2
SHOP PROGRAM PERFORMS.

01:57:15.262 --> 01:57:18.865 region:rollup2
A MORE EXTENSIVE REHABILITATION

01:57:16.897 --> 01:57:20.233 region:rollup2
WORK ON HIGHWAYS.

01:57:18.865 --> 01:57:22.002 region:rollup2
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN HE

01:57:20.233 --> 01:57:23.770 region:rollup2
ALLOCATES A SOMEWHAT MORE

01:57:22.002 --> 01:57:25.405 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO SHOP VERSUS THE

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.339 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM.

01:57:25.405 --> 01:57:27.807 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD

01:57:26.339 --> 01:57:30.543 region:rollup2
CONSIDER MODIFYING.

01:57:27.807 --> 01:57:31.344 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL TO WAIT THE

01:57:30.543 --> 01:57:32.145 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION IN THE OTHER

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.880 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

01:57:32.145 --> 01:57:35.081 region:rollup2
BOTH PROGRAMS HAVE LARGE BACK

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:36.583 region:rollup2
LOTS OF PROJECT IN FUNDING

01:57:35.081 --> 01:57:37.717 region:rollup2
SHORTFALLS.

01:57:36.583 --> 01:57:39.519 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S THREE REASONS WHY WE

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:41.555 region:rollup2
THINK THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM.

01:57:39.519 --> 01:57:42.522 region:rollup2
MIGHT MERIT MORE FUNDING AND

01:57:41.555 --> 01:57:43.924 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE FIRST.

01:57:42.522 --> 01:57:45.225 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE CAN SAVE

01:57:43.924 --> 01:57:47.027 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT MONEY IN THE LONG

01:57:45.225 --> 01:57:47.928 region:rollup2
RUN THROUGH PREVENTION.

01:57:47.027 --> 01:57:49.329 region:rollup2
CALTRANS ESTIMATES FOR EACH

01:57:47.928 --> 01:57:51.064 region:rollup2
DOLLAR OF MAINTENANCE WORK SAVES

01:57:49.329 --> 01:57:54.067 region:rollup2
BETWEEN FOUR AND TWELVE DOLLARS

01:57:51.064 --> 01:57:55.969 region:rollup2
BY POSTPONING SHOT PROJECTS.

01:57:54.067 --> 01:57:57.504 region:rollup2
AND SECOND AS I MENTIONED THE.

01:57:55.969 --> 01:57:58.972 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT THE FUNDING

01:57:57.504 --> 01:58:01.274 region:rollup2
SHORTFALL FOR MAINTENANCE A

01:57:58.972 --> 01:58:02.642 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN FOR SHOP.

01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:03.843 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY MENTIONS PROJECTS

01:58:02.642 --> 01:58:05.078 region:rollup2
DON'T REQUIRE AS MUCH DESIGN AND

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:06.579 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING WORK AND SO THEY

01:58:05.078 --> 01:58:07.414 region:rollup2
COULD BE COMPLETED MORE QUICKLY

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:11.785 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT TO SEE.

01:58:07.414 --> 01:58:13.853 region:rollup2
RESULTS FROM SB ONE FASTER.

01:58:11.785 --> 01:58:16.456 region:rollup2
THANK YOU A ADDRESS DEPARTMENT

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:17.891 region:rollup2

RESPOND TO COMMENTS ABOUT THE

01:58:21.995 --> 01:58:24.898 region:rollup2
SPLIT BETWEEN THE SHOP AS A.

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:26.600 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE FUNDING.

01:58:24.898 --> 01:58:27.968 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO DO BOTH WE NEED TO

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.369 region:rollup2
SPEND MONEY ON THE SHOP AND ON

01:58:27.968 --> 01:58:30.370 region:rollup2
THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AS I

01:58:29.369 --> 01:58:31.371 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

01:58:30.370 --> 01:58:33.907 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN ASSET

01:58:31.371 --> 01:58:34.407 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT GUIDES ARE

01:58:33.907 --> 01:58:35.475 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN THE IN THE

01:58:34.407 --> 01:58:37.277 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:38.979 region:rollup2
AND AFTER YEARS OF UNDERFUNDING

01:58:37.277 --> 01:58:40.914 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM HAS

01:58:38.979 --> 01:58:42.482 region:rollup2
DETERIORATED BEYOND THE POINT

01:58:40.914 --> 01:58:44.250 region:rollup2
THAT THE MAINTENANCE PROP UP

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:46.219 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WILL. ARE A VIABLE

01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:47.454 region:rollup2
OPTION SO WE LOOK AT EACH

01:58:46.219 --> 01:58:48.888 region:rollup2
SEGMENT THE NEEDS REPAIRS WE

01:58:47.454 --> 01:58:50.623 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE

01:58:48.888 --> 01:58:52.926 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO DO A SHORTER TERM

01:58:50.623 --> 01:58:53.994 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE FIX. OR THE BIGGER

01:58:52.926 --> 01:58:56.029 region:rollup2
SHOP OF THE PROJECT

01:58:53.994 --> 01:58:56.596 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:58:56.029 --> 01:58:59.366 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LONG TERM.

01:58:56.596 --> 01:59:00.867 region:rollup2
NEGLECT OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE

01:58:59.366 --> 01:59:02.502 region:rollup2
WE START WITH THE THAT WE FEEL

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:05.872 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE MIX

01:59:02.502 --> 01:59:07.040 region:rollup2
OF SHOPPING MAINTENANCE DOLLARS.

01:59:05.872 --> 01:59:07.641 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:10.210 region:rollup2

AND MAYBE IT MAYBE IT'S THAT

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:23.089 region:rollup2
THE THAT WENT WITH THAT YOU

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:24.557 region:rollup2
COULD ANSWER ME WITH ELIO AS

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:25.825 region:rollup2
MORE FOR MISSION BUT. DO YOU

01:59:24.557 --> 01:59:27.360 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:30.463 region:rollup2
SKETCHES OF AN ASSESSMENT ON THE

IS.

01:59:45.979 --> 01:59:50.116 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ASKING IF WE'VE ESTIMATED

01:59:47.681 --> 01:59:51.518 region:rollup2
THE AFFECT OF AN INCREASE IN

01:59:50.116 --> 01:59:53.553 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL GAUGE YET IS A.

01:59:51.518 --> 01:59:55.088 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT ANALYSIS

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:57.023 region:rollup2
RECENTLY I DON'T KNOW IF THE

01:59:55.088 --> 01:59:59.125 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION HAS THE PART OF

01:59:57.023 --> 02:00:00.393 region:rollup2
FINANCE DOES YES. SO BY TWENTY

EXCISE TAXES ARE ESTIMATED TO

02:00:01.461 --> 02:00:05.699 region:rollup2
BRING IN ABOUT EIGHT POINT THREE

BILLION DOLLARS.

02:00:05.699 --> 02:00:07.467 region:rollup2
AND AYE INTHAT YEAR AND OF THAT

02:00:06.332 --> 02:00:09.536 region:rollup2
NOT BE THREE BILLION WILL BE

02:00:07.467 --> 02:00:10.603 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTABLE TO SP ONE.

02:00:09.536 --> 02:00:12.338 region:rollup2
RIGHT ACROSS THIS UGLY AT THE AS

02:00:10.603 --> 02:00:13.273 region:rollup2
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE

02:00:12.338 --> 02:00:14.607 region:rollup2
WOULD DISPLACE A SMALL AMOUNT OF

02:00:13.273 --> 02:00:15.742 region:rollup2
THAT REVENUE BY REDUCING THE

02:00:14.607 --> 02:00:17.143 region:rollup2
CONSUMPTION KATHLEEN THAT WOULD

02:00:15.742 --> 02:00:18.745 region:rollup2
HAVE REDUCED THAT BY ABOUT FORTY

02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:20.880 region:rollup2
MILLION HOWEVER.

02:00:18.745 --> 02:00:22.382 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE THERE IS A THAT THE

ITS IT DEVICES I'M NOT THAT

02:08:09.282 --> 02:08:12.818 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:14.921 region:rollup2
THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE WORKING

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:16.322 region:rollup2
ON A MORE COMPLETE PLAN FOR TO

02:08:14.921 --> 02:08:18.024 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE REPLACING

02:08:16.322 --> 02:08:19.292 region:rollup2
THE DEVICES AS COST EFFECTIVELY

02:08:18.024 --> 02:08:20.326 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE.

02:08:19.292 --> 02:08:21.994 region:rollup2
I MEAN THEY'RE GONNA START WITH

02:08:20.326 --> 02:08:23.729 region:rollup2
THE AUGMENTATION FROM WASHER

02:08:21.994 --> 02:08:25.198 region:rollup2
JUST REPLACING BLUNTS AT

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:27.033 region:rollup2
GREATEST RISK OF FAILURE.

02:08:25.198 --> 02:08:27.767 region:rollup2
THEY THEY WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE

02:08:27.033 --> 02:08:29.268 region:rollup2
THAT PLAN WHICH IS WHY THE

02:08:27.767 --> 02:08:30.670 region:rollup2
REQUESTING THAT TWO MILLION

02:08:29.268 --> 02:08:32.638 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THEY DETERMINED THAT

02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:33.239 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD NEED TO HIRE.

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:34.607 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS TO HELP THEM WITH

02:08:33.239 --> 02:08:36.175 region:rollup2
IT.

02:08:34.607 --> 02:08:37.476 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU HEARD THEY WANT A

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:38.778 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THE PLAN IN EIGHTEEN

02:08:37.476 --> 02:08:40.313 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

02:08:38.778 --> 02:08:41.814 region:rollup2
BUT IN ADDITION I ALSO HAVE THE

02:08:40.313 --> 02:08:43.516 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO START SPENDING

02:08:41.814 --> 02:08:44.283 region:rollup2
MONEY TO IMPLEMENT IT.

02:08:43.516 --> 02:08:45.318 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT'S A LITTLE

02:08:44.283 --> 02:08:47.053 region:rollup2
PREMATURE WE THINK THAT THEY

02:08:45.318 --> 02:08:48.354 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO THE PLAN IN EIGHTEEN

02:08:47.053 --> 02:08:49.288 region:rollup2
NINETEEN FIRST SO WE THINK THEY

02:08:48.354 --> 02:08:51.090 region:rollup2
SHOULD APPROVE THE TWO MILLION

02:08:49.288 --> 02:08:52.959 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR THAT. AND THEN HAVE

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:53.593 region:rollup2

02:08:52.959 --> 02:08:56.662 region:rollup2
REQUEST FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE

02:08:53.593 --> 02:08:57.396 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:08:56.662 --> 02:09:01.434 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN

02:08:57.396 --> 02:09:02.635 region:rollup2
LOSE BERMAN.

02:09:01.434 --> 02:09:04.236 region:rollup2
I AVAIL THINK OF HILLARY

02:09:02.635 --> 02:09:05.137 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED MYSELF TO ASSIST THE

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:07.106 region:rollup2

LAST YEAR YOU THAT THE

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:09.942 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED.

02:09:08.107 --> 02:09:11.077 region:rollup2
OVER SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:09:09.942 --> 02:09:13.512 region:rollup2
WORTH OF EQUIPMENT THAT IS

02:09:11.077 --> 02:09:15.181 region:rollup2
PASSED IT'S FAR PAST IT'S IT'S A

02:09:13.512 --> 02:09:15.615 region:rollup2
TIME TO BE REPLACED.

02:09:15.181 --> 02:09:17.550 region:rollup2
AND.

02:09:15.615 --> 02:09:19.352 region:rollup2
IN DOING SO LAST YEAR WE PUT

02:09:17.550 --> 02:09:20.620 region:rollup2
TOGETHER THE. ONE FIFTH OF A

02:09:19.352 --> 02:09:22.154 region:rollup2
TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST

02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:23.589 region:rollup2
FOR THE EQUIPMENT THAT HAD THE

02:09:22.154 --> 02:09:24.056 region:rollup2
HIGHEST CRITICALITY.

02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:26.592 region:rollup2
AND.

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:27.093 region:rollup2
THE THE MOST OF THE POTENTIAL

02:09:26.592 --> 02:09:28.194 region:rollup2
TO CAUSE PROBLEMS NOT BE

02:09:27.093 --> 02:09:29.228 region:rollup2
REPLACED.

02:09:28.194 --> 02:09:30.363 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THAT STILL LEAVES YOU

02:09:29.228 --> 02:09:32.365 region:rollup2
KNOW CLOSE TO FIFTY MILLION

02:09:30.363 --> 02:09:32.898 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT THAT IS YOU

02:09:32.365 --> 02:09:33.933 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT HAS BEEN ALREADY

02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:36.202 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED.

02:09:33.933 --> 02:09:36.736 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT DID CREATE A

02:09:36.202 --> 02:09:38.771 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:09:36.736 --> 02:09:40.673 region:rollup2
UP PLAN FOR HARDWARE.

02:09:38.771 --> 02:09:42.241 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT.

02:09:40.673 --> 02:09:43.142 region:rollup2
AND IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING

02:09:42.241 --> 02:09:45.144 region:rollup2
THAT PLAN.

02:09:43.142 --> 02:09:47.480 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IS PART OF REVIEW

02:09:45.144 --> 02:09:49.181 region:rollup2
THAT PLAN WE WE WANTED TO THEN

02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:50.149 region:rollup2
EXTEND.

02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:51.951 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT.

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:53.252 region:rollup2
.

02:09:51.951 --> 02:09:54.053 region:rollup2
IT'S SORT OF A SYSTEM WIDE SO

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:56.322 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST A HARDWARE

02:09:54.053 --> 02:09:57.823 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT PLAN BUT A PLAN FOR

02:09:56.322 --> 02:09:58.691 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH

02:09:57.823 --> 02:09:59.992 region:rollup2
THE I. T..

02:09:58.691 --> 02:10:01.327 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO WHAT'S GOING TO BE

02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:02.428 region:rollup2
STORED IN THE CLOUD WHAT YOU

02:10:01.327 --> 02:10:03.529 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT

02:10:02.428 --> 02:10:04.997 region:rollup2
OPTIONS HOW DOES THIS.

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:05.898 region:rollup2
HOW DID THESE HARDWARE

02:10:04.997 --> 02:10:08.134 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT?

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:09.635 region:rollup2
PLANS PALACES HEART REPLACEMENT

02:10:08.134 --> 02:10:11.837 region:rollup2
PLAN FIT IN WITH THE OVERALL IT

02:10:09.635 --> 02:10:12.805 region:rollup2
PLANTS SO. THIS TWO MILLION

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:14.874 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

02:10:12.805 --> 02:10:16.342 region:rollup2
HERE IS ESSENTIALLY TO LOOK AT

02:10:14.874 --> 02:10:18.678 region:rollup2
THAT PLAN IT'S A IT'S A

02:10:16.342 --> 02:10:19.545 region:rollup2
PROGRESSION FROM THE PLAN THOSE

02:10:18.678 --> 02:10:20.379 region:rollup2
RD PUT TOGETHER REGARDING THE

02:10:19.545 --> 02:10:23.015 region:rollup2
HARDWARE.

02:10:20.379 --> 02:10:25.217 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR PROPOSAL IS TO IT NOT

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:26.385 region:rollup2
UNTIL THAT PLANET DEFIES TO

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:28.354 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THIS THE HARDWARE

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:29.722 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THAT WE WANT TO

02:10:28.354 --> 02:10:31.991 region:rollup2
REPLACE. IS.

02:10:29.722 --> 02:10:33.292 region:rollup2
IS PART OF THE FUTURE PLANS

02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:35.494 region:rollup2
OVERALL SO THE WE'RE NOT

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:36.295 region:rollup2
REPLACING THINGS THAT WE'RE THEN

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:37.930 region:rollup2
GOING TO TURN TURN AROUND AND.

02:10:36.295 --> 02:10:38.798 region:rollup2
USE A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY OR

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:39.665 region:rollup2
USE A DIFFERENT.

02:10:38.798 --> 02:10:43.202 region:rollup2
TYPE OF.

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:44.704 region:rollup2
IF IT IT UP PLAN.

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:46.439 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL NOT.

02:10:44.704 --> 02:10:47.807 region:rollup2
CONTINUE WITH THE REPLACEMENT

02:10:46.439 --> 02:10:49.909 region:rollup2
OF ANY ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT

02:10:47.807 --> 02:10:50.476 region:rollup2
UNTIL THAT PLANET TO IS IS

02:10:49.909 --> 02:10:51.310 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED SO THAT'S WHY WE

02:10:50.476 --> 02:10:53.112 region:rollup2
WANTED TO HAVE.

02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:54.547 region:rollup2
OF UPON IDENTIFICATION OF THAT

02:10:53.112 --> 02:10:55.481 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO STILL REPLACE THE

02:10:54.547 --> 02:10:56.749 region:rollup2
TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

02:10:55.481 --> 02:10:58.317 region:rollup2
HARDWARE BECAUSE.

02:10:56.749 --> 02:10:59.251 region:rollup2
WE'VE IDENTIFIED FAR GREATER

02:10:58.317 --> 02:11:00.786 region:rollup2
THAN THAT THAT'S GOING TO MEET

02:10:59.251 --> 02:11:02.855 region:rollup2
DE TO REPLACE.

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:04.790 region:rollup2
AND ANY DELAY JUST.

02:11:02.855 --> 02:11:09.495 region:rollup2
THE STATE AT RISK ON THIS

02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:10.129 region:rollup2
IT'S ON A FAILURE ON MY TEETH.

02:11:09.495 --> 02:11:12.131 region:rollup2
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT

02:11:10.129 --> 02:11:13.432 region:rollup2
OR HAS BERMAN AND. I HAD A

PROJECTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

02:28:26.364 --> 02:28:29.701 region:rollup2
ON A NET PRESENT VALUE THE STRAP

02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:31.803 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD BE.

02:28:29.701 --> 02:28:33.271 region:rollup2
THAT ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT MORE

02:28:31.803 --> 02:28:35.407 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE THAN PAY GOES TO PAY

02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:37.008 region:rollup2
GOES WOULD BE PREFERRED. BUT THE

02:28:35.407 --> 02:28:39.844 region:rollup2
COST OF A MULTI YEAR DELAY WOULD

02:28:37.008 --> 02:28:41.546 region:rollup2
ALSO. INCREASE THE PROJECT BY

02:28:39.844 --> 02:28:44.983 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OR SO.

02:28:41.546 --> 02:28:45.917 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NOTE THAT THESE REVENUE

02:28:44.983 --> 02:28:47.619 region:rollup2
AND THAT SHOULD BE A COMMON

02:28:45.917 --> 02:28:50.422 region:rollup2
MECHANISM FOR FINANCING CAPITAL

02:28:47.619 --> 02:28:52.123 region:rollup2

UTILITY OF OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS

02:28:58.496 --> 02:29:04.002 region:rollup2
A BY HOWEVER MUCH LIGHTER WEIGHT

02:29:01.466 --> 02:29:04.502 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THAT THE REASON WHY. THE

02:29:04.002 --> 02:29:04.769 region:rollup2
OLD OFFICERS NEED TO BE

02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:05.503 region:rollup2

SIX MINUTES.

02:29:27.459 --> 02:29:29.994 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WHO GUARANTEED REPRESENT

HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS.

02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:33.798 region:rollup2
OF WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE OF

02:29:32.864 --> 02:29:35.133 region:rollup2
FUND CONDITION THAT WAS PART OF

02:29:33.798 --> 02:29:38.536 region:rollup2
YOUR CONVERSATION WITH THE AND

02:29:35.133 --> 02:29:41.472 region:rollup2
THE A IT IS PARIS FLEA. LOW A

02:29:38.536 --> 02:29:42.373 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THEY DO BOND FINANCING.

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:44.742 region:rollup2
THE BALANCE THE IN YOUR

02:29:42.373 --> 02:29:46.344 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS WHICH IS VERY WELL

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:47.779 region:rollup2
WRITTEN AND RESEARCHED.

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:49.180 region:rollup2
A SHOWS HITS LIKE THREE HUNDRED

02:29:47.779 --> 02:29:51.015 region:rollup2
MILLION AND CHANGE.

02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:53.284 region:rollup2
A AND IF THEY DO THE BOND

02:29:51.015 --> 02:29:54.886 region:rollup2
FINANCING THAT THAT LEVEL STAYS

02:29:53.284 --> 02:29:55.954 region:rollup2
BUT IF THEY DON'T THEN IT'S LIKE

02:29:54.886 --> 02:29:57.822 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY. MILLION OUT

02:29:55.954 --> 02:29:59.791 region:rollup2
OF.

02:29:57.822 --> 02:30:01.326 region:rollup2
THAT HOW MANY BILLION IS A TOTAL

02:29:59.791 --> 02:30:03.027 region:rollup2
OF THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION. I

02:30:01.326 --> 02:30:04.929 region:rollup2
CAN'T DO THE PERCENTAGESIN MY

02:30:03.027 --> 02:30:07.065 region:rollup2
HEAD BUT IT'S A PRETTY LOW

02:30:04.929 --> 02:30:07.832 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE TO HAVE AS A. BUFFER.

02:30:07.065 --> 02:30:10.635 region:rollup2
ALL BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SO MANY

02:30:07.832 --> 02:30:11.469 region:rollup2
EMERGENCIES THAT REQUIRE THE CHP

02:30:10.635 --> 02:30:12.003 region:rollup2
TO EXPEND FUNDS THAT THEY DIDN'T

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:17.175 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE SUCH AS THE BIG

02:30:12.003 --> 02:30:19.043 region:rollup2
FIRES.

02:30:17.175 --> 02:30:20.845 region:rollup2
IN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:22.380 region:rollup2
VENTURA FIRE THIS THOMAS FIRE

02:30:20.845 --> 02:30:23.915 region:rollup2
THE TUBS FIRED ALL THE OTHERS SO

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:24.616 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S COSTS THAT THEY

02:30:23.915 --> 02:30:26.451 region:rollup2
CAN ANTICIPATE.

02:30:24.616 --> 02:30:28.453 region:rollup2
SO WE WE KNOW THAT THE FUND

02:30:26.451 --> 02:30:29.454 region:rollup2
CONDITION IS IS SHAKING.

02:30:28.453 --> 02:30:30.555 region:rollup2
AND WHO YOU KNOW FINANCES TRYING

02:30:29.454 --> 02:30:31.890 region:rollup2
TO.

02:30:30.555 --> 02:30:33.091 region:rollup2
PATCHES AS BEST THEY CAN WITH

02:30:31.890 --> 02:30:34.659 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA REVENUE BONDS BUT I'M

02:30:33.091 --> 02:30:36.127 region:rollup2
NOT SURE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO.

02:30:34.659 --> 02:30:37.529 region:rollup2
FINANCE BECAUSE AND YOU HAVE

02:30:36.127 --> 02:30:39.364 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF OF

02:30:37.529 --> 02:30:41.132 region:rollup2
FINANCING COSTS THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:30:39.364 --> 02:30:43.201 region:rollup2
BEAR SO ONE WHERE ANOTHER

02:30:41.132 --> 02:30:44.936 region:rollup2
REPAYING. BUT IN THE LONG RUN IF

02:30:43.201 --> 02:30:46.037 region:rollup2
YOU FINANCE YOUR PAYING MORE.

02:30:44.936 --> 02:30:48.373 region:rollup2
A SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT

02:30:46.037 --> 02:30:49.874 region:rollup2
COMMENT A URINALYSIS ALSO POINTS

02:30:48.373 --> 02:30:52.377 region:rollup2
OUT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DONE

02:30:49.874 --> 02:30:54.112 region:rollup2
WHERE A I KNOW DMV SELLS

02:30:52.377 --> 02:30:55.813 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO INSURANCE

02:30:54.112 --> 02:30:57.081 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ON DRIVERS RECORDS.

02:30:55.813 --> 02:30:59.083 region:rollup2
AND THAT MONEY IS NOT PROTECTED

02:30:57.081 --> 02:31:00.752 region:rollup2
BY ARTICLE NINETEEN SO THERE'S

02:30:59.083 --> 02:31:03.354 region:rollup2
EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

02:31:00.752 --> 02:31:05.523 region:rollup2
THIS COLLECTED BUT THOSE MONIES

02:31:03.354 --> 02:31:06.925 region:rollup2
ARE SENT TO THE GENERAL FUND.

02:31:05.523 --> 02:31:08.660 region:rollup2
AND THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IT'S

02:31:06.925 --> 02:31:10.695 region:rollup2
A POSSIBILITY TO CONSIDER

02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:12.497 region:rollup2
KEEPING THAT IN THE NBA CAO

02:31:10.695 --> 02:31:14.065 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF SENDING OUT IT'S ONLY

02:31:12.497 --> 02:31:15.233 region:rollup2
BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT. A

02:31:14.065 --> 02:31:17.168 region:rollup2
ACCORDING THE ANALYSIS SINCE

02:31:15.233 --> 02:31:19.704 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWELVE A A COURSE WE HAD

02:31:17.168 --> 02:31:21.673 region:rollup2
SOME SERIOUS BUDGET OF PROBLEMS

02:31:19.704 --> 02:31:23.608 region:rollup2
BACK IN THOSE YEARS SO MY

02:31:21.673 --> 02:31:25.610 region:rollup2
CONSIDER RETAINING. THAT EIGHTY

02:31:23.608 --> 02:31:27.545 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION THAT LEGITIMATELY

02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:28.646 region:rollup2
IN THE NBA BUT IT'S NOT

02:31:27.545 --> 02:31:30.081 region:rollup2
PROTECTED BY ARTICLE NINETEEN

02:31:28.646 --> 02:31:31.849 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS A SALE OF

02:31:30.081 --> 02:31:33.251 region:rollup2
INFORMATION RATHER THAN. A

02:31:31.849 --> 02:31:33.685 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION FEES.

02:31:33.251 --> 02:31:35.753 region:rollup2
SO I POINT THAT OUT.

02:31:33.685 --> 02:31:38.389 region:rollup2
.

02:31:35.753 --> 02:31:39.857 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I WOULD MENTION

02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:40.959 region:rollup2
IT IN I SENT AS WELL AS THE

02:31:39.857 --> 02:31:42.427 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT HE ASSOCIATION SENT A

02:31:40.959 --> 02:31:45.430 region:rollup2
LETTER FOR FUTURE HEARING IS

02:31:42.427 --> 02:31:47.599 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. A THE

02:31:45.430 --> 02:31:48.166 region:rollup2
STAFFING OF THE HIGH WITHDRAW

02:31:47.599 --> 02:31:48.900 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING FORTY

02:31:48.166 --> 02:31:49.934 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:51.002 region:rollup2
AND STAFFING HAS BEEN AN ISSUE

02:31:49.934 --> 02:31:53.338 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH FOR ALL FORTY OF

02:31:51.002 --> 02:31:55.940 region:rollup2
THOSE YEARS. AND THEY DON'T

02:31:53.338 --> 02:31:58.076 region:rollup2
COMPLAIN AND THEY TELL ME OKAY

02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:59.277 region:rollup2
IN ORDER DON'T RAISE IT WILL

02:31:58.076 --> 02:32:01.012 region:rollup2
JUST KEEP DOING THE BEST WE CAN

02:31:59.277 --> 02:32:02.914 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT. AND THAT'S

02:32:01.012 --> 02:32:05.249 region:rollup2
HOW THEY ARE PRETTY SSUE FLARED

02:32:02.914 --> 02:32:06.284 region:rollup2
UP AGAIN THIS YEAR AT A BOARD

02:32:05.249 --> 02:32:09.320 region:rollup2
MEETING COMMISSIONER STANLEY WAS

02:32:06.284 --> 02:32:11.122 region:rollup2
HERE AND HE HAD TO DEAL WITH. A

02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:13.591 region:rollup2
PRETTY HOSTILE QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:32:11.122 --> 02:32:15.193 region:rollup2
STAFFING IS SO LOW. AND IN IN

02:32:13.591 --> 02:32:17.161 region:rollup2
THE LETTER POINT OUT THAT IT'LL

02:32:15.193 --> 02:32:18.730 region:rollup2
INCREASE WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB

02:32:17.161 --> 02:32:21.065 region:rollup2
ONE. A BECAUSE THERE'S MORE

02:32:18.730 --> 02:32:22.967 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECTS AND

02:32:21.065 --> 02:32:25.570 region:rollup2
THEY PRESIDE PER PROVIDE THAT

02:32:22.967 --> 02:32:27.472 region:rollup2
PROTECTION IN CONSTRUCTION ZONES

02:32:25.570 --> 02:32:27.739 region:rollup2
AND WILL SCRATCH THE STAFF EVEN

02:32:27.472 --> 02:32:29.107 region:rollup2
FURTHER.

02:32:27.739 --> 02:32:31.476 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:32:29.107 --> 02:32:33.878 region:rollup2
THEIR STAFF IS LOW WITHOUT SP

02:32:31.476 --> 02:32:35.647 region:rollup2
ONE IF YOU TAKE THAT OUT THERE

02:32:33.878 --> 02:32:37.548 region:rollup2
STILL VERY VERY LOW IN WE HAVE

02:32:35.647 --> 02:32:39.283 region:rollup2
CHARTS IT WILL SHOW THE NUMBER

02:32:37.548 --> 02:32:40.551 region:rollup2
OF OFFICERS PER ONE HUNDRED

02:32:39.283 --> 02:32:42.520 region:rollup2
THOUSAND LICENSED DRIVERS. PER

ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:46.057 region:rollup2
VEHICLES AND MAYBE MORE

02:32:43.154 --> 02:32:48.326 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY. PER MILLION MILES

02:32:46.057 --> 02:32:49.727 region:rollup2
OF VEHICLE TRAVEL WE CALL VMT

02:32:48.326 --> 02:32:52.463 region:rollup2
VEHICLE MILES OF TRAVEL.

02:32:49.727 --> 02:32:54.599 region:rollup2
AND THE RATIO OF OFFICERS DAHLE

02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:57.101 region:rollup2
THOSE WORKLOAD INDEXES HAS GONE

02:32:54.599 --> 02:32:58.836 region:rollup2
DOWN. A WE WRITER.

02:32:57.101 --> 02:33:00.538 region:rollup2
STRONG GUESS STRENGTH

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:01.939 region:rollup2
WHEN REAGAN WAS GOVERNOR

02:33:00.538 --> 02:33:04.175 region:rollup2
SO FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS

02:33:01.939 --> 02:33:05.610 region:rollup2
WE'VE STEADILY GONE DOWN.

02:33:04.175 --> 02:33:08.579 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WITH THE CHARTS SHOW

02:33:05.610 --> 02:33:09.914 region:rollup2
OF IN ITS HITS SOMETHING THAT.

02:33:08.579 --> 02:33:11.315 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO RAISE YUSHIN

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:13.551 region:rollup2
