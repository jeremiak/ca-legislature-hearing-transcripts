ANALYSIS OF A WHERE PROPOSITION

00:53:31.008 --> 00:53:33.510 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT HAS BEEN OVER THE

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:35.279 region:rollup2
YEARS. AND THOSE OF THE BLUE

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.814 region:rollup2
BARS IN ADDITION THAT PINK LINE

00:53:35.279 --> 00:53:37.915 region:rollup2
SHOWED YOU WERE REVENUES ARE SO

00:53:36.814 --> 00:53:39.917 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR THE MOST

00:53:37.915 --> 00:53:40.718 region:rollup2
PART OF HISTORICALLY THROUGH THE

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:41.952 region:rollup2
YEARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT.

00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:43.420 region:rollup2
HAS

00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:45.122 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY TRACKED WITH

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.458 region:rollup2
INCREASES AND DECREASES WITH IT

00:53:45.122 --> 00:53:48.926 region:rollup2
WITH REVENUES.

00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:50.094 region:rollup2
I'M I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT OF THE

00:53:48.926 --> 00:53:51.929 region:rollup2
MAJOR DROPPED THE YOU SEE AN

00:53:50.094 --> 00:53:53.464 region:rollup2
ELEVEN TWELVE WHICH IS LIKE THE

00:53:51.929 --> 00:53:54.498 region:rollup2
END OF THE THE RECESSION.

00:53:53.464 --> 00:53:56.033 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WAS

00:53:54.498 --> 00:53:58.068 region:rollup2
SENT FUNDED AT FORTY SEVEN POINT

00:53:56.033 --> 00:53:59.203 region:rollup2
THREE BILLION DOLLARS ON AND THE

00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.971 region:rollup2
PER PUPIL SPENDING ON ELEVEN

00:53:59.203 --> 00:54:01.438 region:rollup2
TWELVE WAS THAT SEVEN THOUSAND

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:03.474 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER STUDENT.

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:05.409 region:rollup2
UP.

00:54:03.474 --> 00:54:06.543 region:rollup2
FROM THE LOW POINT ELEVEN TWELVE

00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:08.412 region:rollup2
ON THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE GROW

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:10.114 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY PRIMARILY AGAIN TO

00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:12.249 region:rollup2
THIS INCREASE IN REVENUES.

00:54:10.114 --> 00:54:13.817 region:rollup2
AND WHERE WE ENDED UP TWO

00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:14.351 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS AT

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:16.286 region:rollup2
SEVENTY EIGHT POINT THREE

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:17.554 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE PER

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.922 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SPENDING IS ELEVEN

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:19.890 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS SO

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:21.725 region:rollup2
THAT THE FORTY SIX HUNDRED

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:23.527 region:rollup2
DOLLAR INCREASE IN THAT TIME

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:25.529 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

00:54:23.527 --> 00:54:26.964 region:rollup2
SO IN FIGURE TWO OF THIS JUST

00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:28.765 region:rollup2
SHOWS YOU THE THREE YEAR WINDOW

00:54:26.964 --> 00:54:30.267 region:rollup2
OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOT

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:32.503 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE THAT'S IN THIS BUDGET.

00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:34.571 region:rollup2
OF THE FIRST AGAIN WERE SEEN

00:54:32.503 --> 00:54:36.106 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN A. GENERAL FUND

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:37.341 region:rollup2
REVENUES COME IN ADDITION WERE

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:39.009 region:rollup2
SEEN SOME NOTABLE INCREASES IN

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:40.611 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX.

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:41.912 region:rollup2
IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE

00:54:40.611 --> 00:54:42.880 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE WITHOUT

00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:44.948 region:rollup2
REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM OUR

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:46.817 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS ESTIMATE. AND IT

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:48.018 region:rollup2
REVENUES DROP JUST SLIGHTLY BUT

00:54:46.817 --> 00:54:49.553 region:rollup2
THE MOOD OF THE THE BIGGER

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:51.421 region:rollup2
PICTURE REALLY IS AN INCREASE IN

00:54:49.553 --> 00:54:53.223 region:rollup2
REVENUES. ARE THESE REVENUES RE

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:54.892 region:rollup2
UP PROPERTY TAX REVENUES REFLECT

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:56.160 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY OTHER CONTROLLERS

00:54:54.892 --> 00:54:57.928 region:rollup2
REPORTED AMOUNTS.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.129 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THE

00:54:57.928 --> 00:55:00.164 region:rollup2
ASSESSED VALUES A PROPERTIES

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:01.965 region:rollup2
CAME A LOT HIGHER THAN OUR

00:55:00.164 --> 00:55:03.233 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL ESTIMATE.

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:04.635 region:rollup2
NOT THAT INCREASE CARRIES

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:07.004 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO ALL THREE YEARS AND

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:08.305 region:rollup2
SO WE SEE THE BENEFIT OFFSETTING

00:55:07.004 --> 00:55:09.973 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND FOR ALL THREE

00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:11.408 region:rollup2
OF OUR ESTIMATE YEARS.

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:13.010 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OF THE

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:14.311 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE I CAN WAS

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.846 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A ONE

00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:17.814 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:19.683 region:rollup2
REVENUES A MINIMUM GUARANTEE

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:20.617 region:rollup2
ENDS AT SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE POINT

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:21.752 region:rollup2
TWO BILLION IN THIS CURRENT

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:23.420 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE WHICH IS SIX HUNDRED

00:55:21.752 --> 00:55:25.122 region:rollup2
EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION HIGHER THAN

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.723 region:rollup2
OUR LAST FORECAST.

00:55:25.122 --> 00:55:28.392 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY IN TWO THOUSAND

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:29.993 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RECEIVED A

00:55:28.392 --> 00:55:31.495 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND REVENUES ABOUT

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:33.197 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR POINT SIX BILLION.

00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:34.832 region:rollup2
ON THAT'S NEARLY SIX BILLION

00:55:33.197 --> 00:55:36.433 region:rollup2
DOLLARS MORE THAN OUR REVISED

00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:37.834 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ESTIMATE AND

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:39.436 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT AGAIN THE MINIMUM

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:41.605 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE IS ESTIMATED TO BE

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:43.173 region:rollup2
THREE POINT ONE BILLION MORE

00:55:41.605 --> 00:55:44.508 region:rollup2
THAN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN REVISED.

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:45.843 region:rollup2
AND WE LANDED THE SEVENTY EIGHT

00:55:44.508 --> 00:55:47.477 region:rollup2
POINT THREE BILLION THAT I

00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:49.079 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER. IN TWO

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:50.147 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AWARE

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:51.281 region:rollup2
NOT CHANGING TESTS FOR

00:55:50.147 --> 00:55:53.350 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO BE ON THE TEST

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:54.818 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR HOWEVER WE ARE VERY

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.886 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO MOVING INTO THE HAS TWO

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:57.387 region:rollup2
WHICH JUST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

00:55:55.886 --> 00:55:58.355 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS WILL WILL BE IN A

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:59.790 region:rollup2
TEST TO YEAR.

00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:01.024 region:rollup2
SO I'M AND I AND I MENTION THAT

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.492 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER THING

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:03.994 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD KINDA LIKE TO NOTE.

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:06.430 region:rollup2
IN THIS PROCESS AS WE MOVE

00:56:03.994 --> 00:56:07.965 region:rollup2
TOWARD ME REVISION ANY INCREASES

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:09.433 region:rollup2
IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE WILL NOT

00:56:07.965 --> 00:56:10.701 region:rollup2
IMPACT THE GUARANTEE THAT YOU'VE

00:56:09.433 --> 00:56:12.169 region:rollup2
SEEN IN THE PAST.

00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:13.904 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE FACTORS

00:56:12.169 --> 00:56:15.305 region:rollup2
SIR ARE SET UP THE MAJORITY OF

00:56:13.904 --> 00:56:16.773 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE THE REVENUE IT'S

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.708 region:rollup2
GONNA BE LIMITED TO THE BALANCE

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:19.042 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IS ON THE MAIN ITS

00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:20.143 region:rollup2
FACTOR BALANCE.

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:22.145 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ABOUT TO TURN TWENTY

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:22.746 region:rollup2
MILLION AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:24.314 region:rollup2
AND ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:26.416 region:rollup2
MILLION.

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:27.618 region:rollup2
AND I EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO THERE

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:30.020 region:rollup2
ARE A FEW OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN

00:56:27.618 --> 00:56:31.955 region:rollup2
CHANGE HOW WE DON'T. ANTICIPATE

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.856 region:rollup2
THEM INTO CHANGING TOO MUCH BUT

00:56:31.955 --> 00:56:34.057 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TURNOUT

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:35.892 region:rollup2
AND AND I KNOW THE LOT OF

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:37.127 region:rollup2
REPORTS ABOUT THE RECENT RECENT

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:38.695 region:rollup2
REVENUE FORECAST JUST SO YOU

00:56:37.127 --> 00:56:40.230 region:rollup2
KNOW IN EDUCATION. THERE MAY NOT

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:42.099 region:rollup2
BE A BENEFITS THAT.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.667 region:rollup2
THE NO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S PER

00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:45.636 region:rollup2
HOW YOU'D SCORE IT. VERSES IN

00:56:43.667 --> 00:56:46.403 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT BUT.

00:56:45.636 --> 00:56:48.405 region:rollup2
WHAT IT DOES DAHLE BE?

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:50.807 region:rollup2
?

00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:51.975 region:rollup2
MORE ONGOING THAN ONE TIME

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:53.343 region:rollup2
PERCHED TOO LATE EARLY TELL

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:55.279 region:rollup2
THEIR AT MINIMUM GUARANTEE WOULD

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:57.381 region:rollup2
NOT WILL NOT INCREASE VERY MUCH

00:56:55.279 --> 00:56:58.382 region:rollup2
AT ALL SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU

00:56:57.381 --> 00:57:00.017 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FUNDS THAT ARE

00:56:58.382 --> 00:57:01.351 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE. AND AND YOU KNOW NOT

00:57:00.017 --> 00:57:02.119 region:rollup2
CALCULATED THE MEN AND GUARANTEE

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:03.887 region:rollup2
YOU CHRIS MOVE THE MINIMUM

00:57:02.119 --> 00:57:05.455 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED BAR UP THE FOLLOWING

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:08.358 region:rollup2
YEAR BUT. NO WE REALLY I'M AND I

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:09.092 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THE LA AGREES ON THIS

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:10.460 region:rollup2
POINT WITH ARE FACTORS THAT.

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:11.828 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.997 region:rollup2
PROBABLY MAXES OUT AROUND TWO

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:15.932 region:rollup2
TWENTY AND AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:17.334 region:rollup2
AND A THREE HUNDRED MILLION.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:18.635 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF IF THE REVENUES GO

00:57:17.334 --> 00:57:22.205 region:rollup2
UP SIX BILLION IT'LL.

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:23.473 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE THE INCREASE.

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:24.508 region:rollup2
SO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:25.876 region:rollup2
MIGHT BENEFIT RETURN MENTIONED

00:57:24.508 --> 00:57:26.910 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT.

00:57:25.876 --> 00:57:29.880 region:rollup2
THEY WERE GETTING A OF THIS

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:31.281 region:rollup2
FUNDING OKAY I'M SO UP. ON THE

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.016 region:rollup2
SECOND PAGE ON IS WHERE I GIVE

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.550 region:rollup2
YOU A PROVIDE YOU WITH THE

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:35.652 region:rollup2
DETAILS OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:37.521 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

00:57:35.652 --> 00:57:39.289 region:rollup2
FIGURES THREE I JUST SUMMARIZES

00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:40.424 region:rollup2
THE VALUABLE FUNDING SOURCES OF

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.725 region:rollup2
THE FIRST YEAR THEY AND CHANGES

00:57:40.424 --> 00:57:43.727 region:rollup2
IN THE GUARANTEE THAT I HAD

00:57:41.725 --> 00:57:45.595 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED ON THE OTHER PAGE.

00:57:43.727 --> 00:57:47.364 region:rollup2
ON THEN ADDITION I'M IN A PROP

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:48.999 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT WE HAVE ONE TIME

00:57:47.364 --> 00:57:49.533 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT BECOME AVAILABLE

00:57:48.999 --> 00:57:50.734 region:rollup2
I'M WHEN WE SPEND ONE TIME

00:57:49.533 --> 00:57:52.102 region:rollup2
MONEY.

00:57:50.734 --> 00:57:54.004 region:rollup2
SOME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:57:52.102 --> 00:57:56.239 region:rollup2
SAVINGS ALSO ON THOSE TOTAL

00:57:54.004 --> 00:57:57.941 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:59.343 region:rollup2
IN TOTAL AVAILABLE RESOURCES.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.593 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE OUTSTANDING MANDATE.

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:51.194 region:rollup2
ADAM BALANCES THE IT WOULD BE

HE NEXT TO RELATED TO A SPECIAL

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:03.673 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PROPOSAL. AS I'M SURE

THE THINGS THAT THAT BECAME

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:10.680 region:rollup2

PACKAGE.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:30.206 region:rollup2
AS YOU HEARD THE KEY FACTOR IN

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.441 region:rollup2
THE INCREASES IN THE SEVENTEEN

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:33.610 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:34.711 region:rollup2
GUARANTY IS OUR THE REVISED US

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:36.046 region:rollup2
REVISED ESTIMATES. UPPER

DIVISION THIS TO GENERAL FUND

REVENUE.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.451 region:rollup2
I WANT OTHER KEEFE FACTOR WE

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:42.552 region:rollup2
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WAS KEY

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:44.020 region:rollup2
TWELVE ATTENDANCE AT THE

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:45.355 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND PREVIOUSLY

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.524 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED A SMALL ATTENDANCE

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:49.059 region:rollup2
INCREASE HEARD A DECLINE IN

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:50.260 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. ARE

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:51.461 region:rollup2
THEY NOW ESTIMATE A SMALL

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.230 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:55.932 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S. A REALLY SIGNIFICANT

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:58.134 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ON.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:04:00.437 region:rollup2
EVEN A MINOR ATTENDANCE INCREASE

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:01.438 region:rollup2
IN ONE YEAR AYE TRIGGERS A HOLD

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:03.940 region:rollup2
HARMLESS PROVISION IN THE STATE

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:05.675 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION. AND THAT PROVISION

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.910 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY CANCEL THE EFFECT OF

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.378 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE DECLINES DURING THE

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.379 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING TWO YEARS

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:10.680 region:rollup2
SO EVEN THOUGH ATTENDANCE IS

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:12.415 region:rollup2
PROJECTED TO DECLINE THREE

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.684 region:rollup2
TENTHS OF A PERCENT. OF A

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:15.985 region:rollup2
PERCENT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:17.520 region:rollup2
SMALL INCREASE IN SEVENTEEN

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:18.555 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN COUNCILS THAT.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.590 region:rollup2
AFFECTING THE CALCULATION OF THE

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:22.292 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:23.760 region:rollup2
BOB I THINK YOU ALSO HEARD ABOUT

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:25.195 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S MAINTENANCE FACTOR

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.396 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION AS YOU NO MAINTENANCE

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.430 region:rollup2
FACTOR IS REALLY THIS

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:28.898 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT TO

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:31.167 region:rollup2
MAKE CATCH UP PAYMENTS TO

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:32.635 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS. A TO MAKE UP FOR

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:34.738 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS DURING TIGHTER FISCAL

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:36.773 region:rollup2
TIMES I SIX YEARS AGO THAT

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:38.575 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION STOOD AT RIGHT AROUND

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:39.876 region:rollup2
TEN POINT SIX BILLION. SO

01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:41.578 region:rollup2
REDUCING IT NOW TO WITH GOING TO

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.846 region:rollup2
TWENTY MILLION AT THE END OF

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:45.415 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I THINK AS A

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:45.949 region:rollup2
MARKER OF THE STATE'S A FISCAL

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:48.551 region:rollup2
PROGRESS OVER THE PAST SIX

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:50.754 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:52.288 region:rollup2
I JUMPING AHEAD TO PAGE THREE.

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:54.023 region:rollup2

EIGHT DOLLARS PER STUDENT IN

EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THAT'S AN

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:01.464 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF AROUND FOUR PERCENT

01:04:59.796 --> 01:05:02.999 region:rollup2

PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:20.710 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:22.278 region:rollup2
AND I'VE REALLY COMPARE ABILITY

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.745 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION SHEET JUST

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.948 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED A LITTLE BIT

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:26.115 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY.

01:06:24.948 --> 01:06:28.418 region:rollup2
I TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN IN OUR

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:29.419 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT I THINK OVERALL WHAT

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.888 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:33.256 region:rollup2
REFLECTS A GOOD MIX OF ONE TIME

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:35.258 region:rollup2
AND I'M GOING SPENDING.

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:36.459 region:rollup2
I THE IMPORTANCE OF RESERVING

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:38.061 region:rollup2
SOME FUNDING FOR ONE TIME

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:40.330 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES IS NOT ALWAYS

01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:42.198 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS AND GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.966 region:rollup2
LIKE THE STATE IS AND HOW.

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:44.434 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE STATE WERE TO

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:46.569 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE A DOWNTURN IN THE

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:47.737 region:rollup2
NEXT FEW YEARS I THAT APPROACH

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:48.938 region:rollup2
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:51.207 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP THE STATE AVOID THE

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:53.276 region:rollup2
NEED FOR REDUCTION STILL CFF FOR

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:54.510 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER ONGOING PROGRAM.

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:56.112 region:rollup2
I TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.447 region:rollup2
PREVIEW OF SOME OF OUR. OTHER

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:58.882 region:rollup2
MESSAGES TO HEAR OVER THE NEXT

01:06:57.447 --> 01:07:00.783 region:rollup2
FEW HEARING THIS.

01:06:58.882 --> 01:07:02.085 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION I

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:03.553 region:rollup2
DESERVE SOME CREDIT FOR IT

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.087 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING A GOOD SET OF

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:05.121 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES AND THIS YEAR'S

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:07.123 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:09.092 region:rollup2

ON.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:14.264 region:rollup2
GOT A SUPPORTING LOW PERFORMING

DISTRICT THESE ARE ALL ISSUES

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.533 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF YOUR

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:18.234 region:rollup2
QUITE PRIORITIES FOR A NUMBER OF

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:20.003 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:22.505 region:rollup2
I THINK AYE MAIN CONCERN IS THAT

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:24.474 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS I

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:25.775 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:28.344 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS IN THOSE

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:29.879 region:rollup2
AREAS AND SO IN FOR EACH OF

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:32.181 region:rollup2
THOSE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS TO HEAR

ALTERNATIVES TO YOU TO CONSIDER

HOW THAT MIGHT TRY TO GET OUT

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:39.555 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE WHO ISSUE.

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:40.957 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN WE THINK THIS

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:42.659 region:rollup2
YEAR'S BUDGET AND THIS IS AN

01:07:40.957 --> 01:07:44.394 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO RETIRE THE K.

AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

MILLION. AND THE GOVERNOR'S

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:51.901 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE THAT

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:53.369 region:rollup2
AMOUNT WE ESTIMATE BY LESS THAN

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:54.704 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED MILLION.

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:56.205 region:rollup2

FINAL AMOUNT

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:59.142 region:rollup2
A FOR THE BACKLOG THAT COULD BE

01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:00.343 region:rollup2
THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION THE

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:02.512 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR PROPOSES COULD BE A

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:04.247 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AMOUNT.

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:06.482 region:rollup2
AND THEN DISTRIBUTE AYE THAT

AMOUNT ON A PER STUDENT BASIS

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:09.619 region:rollup2

GUARANTEE OUR OVERALL WE'RE

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:23.066 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT THAT DIFFERENT IN OUR

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:24.767 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES OF THE MINIMUM

COMPARED WITH OUR NOVEMBER

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:29.439 region:rollup2

01:08:41.384 --> 01:08:44.620 region:rollup2
VERY CLOSELY LIKELY AVAILABLE

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:45.955 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.191 region:rollup2
SEE IF THAT HOLD HARMLESS

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:50.159 region:rollup2
PROVISIONAL APPLY. IF IT DOESN'T

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:50.693 region:rollup2
THE EATING NINETEEN GUARANTEE

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:52.362 region:rollup2
COULD ACTUALLY DROP A FEW

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:53.730 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION. I WILL BE

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:54.764 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT CLOSELY AND

01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:57.367 region:rollup2
KEEPING YOU UPDATED ON THAT

01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:58.801 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS.

01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:59.535 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.170 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION'S LOCAL

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:02.639 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX ESTIMATES AND

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:04.407 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN A BIT OF A

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:05.675 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN OUR.

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:06.909 region:rollup2
I NUMBERS IN THE PAST

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:08.144 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS A LITTLE BIT

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:10.780 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN WHERE WE WERE IN

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:12.582 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER BUT WE THINK OVER ALL.

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:14.217 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBERS ARE REASONABLE IN

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:17.387 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR

01:09:14.217 --> 01:09:18.988 region:rollup2
YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS.

01:09:17.387 --> 01:09:20.456 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.324 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND REVENUE IS LIKELY

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:23.092 region:rollup2
TO BE HIGHER THAN THE

01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:24.394 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES PERHAPS

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:25.595 region:rollup2
THREE BILLION OR MORE OVER

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:27.697 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:28.998 region:rollup2
NINETEEN. ABBOTT CONSISTENT WITH

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:30.199 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU AYE KRYPTONIAN

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:31.601 region:rollup2
MINISTRATION EVEN A REALLY LARGE

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:33.503 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:34.737 region:rollup2
THREE BILLION OR MORE ISN'T

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:36.506 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO INCREASE THE GUARANTEE

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:38.408 region:rollup2
IN EITHER YEAR ON BY MORE THAN A

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:40.076 region:rollup2
FEW HUNDRED MILLION.

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:40.877 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:42.412 region:rollup2
THE AD THAT YOU HAD THE

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:44.013 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S SAY A FEW

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:45.481 region:rollup2
WEEKS AGO. THAT.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.949 region:rollup2
OF ANY NEW REVENUE MATERIALIZING

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:48.484 region:rollup2
IN MAY MOST OF THAT WILL BE

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:50.420 region:rollup2
DISCRETIONARY WILL BE AVAILABLE

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.988 region:rollup2
FOR ANY OF YOUR PRIORITIES.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.656 region:rollup2
UNLIKE IN PAST YEARS WHERE IT'S

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:55.058 region:rollup2
BEEN DEDICATED A.

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:56.359 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS THROUGH PROPOSITION

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:57.727 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:10:00.329 region:rollup2
AS SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:09:57.727 --> 01:10:02.165 region:rollup2
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:03.900 region:rollup2
SURE I CAN CAN YOU SPENT SOME

01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:05.201 region:rollup2
MORE TIME THAT THE LAST POINT

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.003 region:rollup2
THAT YOU JUST MADE AND WHAT

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:09.072 region:rollup2
FINANCE SAID EARLIER.

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:10.606 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS YOUR YOUR THAT MAC

01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:11.874 region:rollup2
TAYLOR PROJECTIONS WHAT YOU

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:13.576 region:rollup2
CATCHING US NOW IF THERE IF

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:15.211 region:rollup2
THERE THREE BILLION HIGHER COME

01:10:13.576 --> 01:10:17.213 region:rollup2
MAY REVISE.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:18.614 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL OF IT.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.749 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WOULD BE WHEN BE

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:22.085 region:rollup2
CALCULATED IN THE PROP NINETY

01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:23.352 region:rollup2
EIGHT GUARANTEES THAT'S RIGHT SO

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:25.188 region:rollup2
ARE AT NOVEMBER.

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:26.489 region:rollup2
FISCAL OUTLOOK ESTIMATED THAT

01:10:25.188 --> 01:10:27.990 region:rollup2
ACROSS SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:29.525 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN STATE REVENUE

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:30.193 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THREE POINT TWO BILLION

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.461 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN WHERE THE

01:10:30.193 --> 01:10:33.529 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS NOW ACROSS

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:35.498 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO YEARS.

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:36.365 region:rollup2
A SENSE THAT TIME.

01:10:35.498 --> 01:10:38.067 region:rollup2
SO FAR THE PRELIMINARY DATA

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:39.402 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:41.270 region:rollup2
HOW ABOUT SOME INCREASED LOOKS

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:43.005 region:rollup2
LIKELY AYE JANUARY TAX

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.340 region:rollup2
COLLECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WERE

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:45.875 region:rollup2
ALREADY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION.

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.343 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN THAT JANUARY BUDGET

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:48.878 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES.

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:49.445 region:rollup2
ON HIM WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:51.247 region:rollup2
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:52.381 region:rollup2
THE.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.915 region:rollup2
RECENT TURBULENCE IN THE STOCK

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:54.383 region:rollup2
MARKET SORT OF CHANGES OUR

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.485 region:rollup2
OUTLOOK.

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:56.919 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T THINK IT DOES AT

01:10:55.485 --> 01:10:57.854 region:rollup2
THIS POINT AYE EVEN AT ITS

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.455 region:rollup2
LOWEST POINT OVER THE PAST FEW

01:10:57.854 --> 01:11:00.790 region:rollup2
WEEKS.

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:01.624 region:rollup2
THE STOCK MARKET IS STILL ABOVE

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.693 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL THAT WE HAD ASSUMED WE

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:05.595 region:rollup2
DID OUR NOVEMBER OUTLOOK.

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:07.630 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IF THE MONEY'S COMMAND.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:10.933 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:12.902 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR.

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:14.937 region:rollup2
AND IT THERE ONE TIME MONIES

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:17.607 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD IT GOING TO THAT.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:19.008 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT ONE TIME. LEDGER.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:20.143 region:rollup2
SO THAT PREDICT THE GUARANTEE

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:21.644 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN COULD

01:11:20.143 --> 01:11:23.045 region:rollup2
INCREASE PERHAPS AROUND TWO

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:23.880 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:25.381 region:rollup2
MILLION SOMETHING ALONG THOSE

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.783 region:rollup2
LINES THAT'S PROBABLY SORT OF

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.251 region:rollup2
THE BEST CASE FOR THE MINIMUM

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:29.552 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:30.887 region:rollup2
AND THAT INCREASE COULD ALSO

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:32.388 region:rollup2
CARRY FORWARD INTO EIGHTEEN

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:34.323 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN COULD

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.858 region:rollup2
BE A FEW HUNDRED MILLION HIGHER.

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:37.627 region:rollup2
I THAN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:38.594 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES AND IN THAT CASE IT

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:39.762 region:rollup2
WAS AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YOU

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:41.697 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:43.633 region:rollup2
ONGOING MONEY TO WORK WITH.

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:45.234 region:rollup2
AND BUT IT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:47.136 region:rollup2
THE DYNAMIC THAT WE HADN'T SAY

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:48.271 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WITH A GUARANTEE

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.472 region:rollup2
WERE STATE REVENUE INCREASED

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:51.174 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.707 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE WAS GOING ESSENTIALLY

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:54.243 region:rollup2
DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WITHOUT

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:55.778 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:58.181 region:rollup2
OKAY. AND THEN.

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:59.749 region:rollup2
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE

01:11:58.181 --> 01:12:03.252 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOME

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:04.854 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ONE. HAD.

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:06.255 region:rollup2
YEAH I TO ISSUES THAT WE HAVE.

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:07.890 region:rollup2
BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT ARRIVING

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:09.525 region:rollup2
HEARING ON I THINK NEXT WEEK IS

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:11.627 region:rollup2
A SPECIAL ED AND A FEW WEEKS AGO

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:13.696 region:rollup2
WE HAD A HEARING ON. THAT THE

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:14.597 region:rollup2
TEACHER SHORTAGE AND SO SEEING

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:16.666 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL WHERE YOU KIND OF

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:16.833 region:rollup2
FAT. MERE THOSE TWO ISSUES WITH

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.302 region:rollup2
THE.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.803 region:rollup2
WITH THE TEACHER RESIDENCY IDEA

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:23.472 region:rollup2
HERE WE WE HAD HEARINGS LAST FEW

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:24.974 region:rollup2
YEARS AND IN SOME OF THE MOST

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.141 region:rollup2
PROMISING IDEAS CAME FROM.

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:27.743 region:rollup2
THE.

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:29.445 region:rollup2
LP I LEARNING POLICY LIGHTS BUT

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:31.647 region:rollup2
THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM SO

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.215 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN EMBRACED FOR. FOR GOT%

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:34.617 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ED. BUT IS IS THERE

01:12:32.215 --> 01:12:36.018 region:rollup2
ALSO.

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:37.353 region:rollup2
AND OPENNESS TO LOOK AT THE

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.821 region:rollup2
IDEA AS.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:40.389 region:rollup2
THAT EDUCATION AS A WHOLE

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:41.891 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAD TO HAVE A TEACHER

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:43.492 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE IN.

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:45.294 region:rollup2
ALL THE AREAS ACROSS THE BOARD

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:46.662 region:rollup2
NOT JUST A SPECIAL AND.

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:48.231 region:rollup2
AND THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:50.132 region:rollup2
UNIQUE BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:51.767 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS HAVE TO PAY UP. THERE

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:53.402 region:rollup2
THEIR PIECES WELL AND YOU THINK

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.936 region:rollup2
AND GROW THEIR OWN SO IT'S BEEN

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.938 region:rollup2
ABOUT PROMISING ON SEVERAL

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:57.440 region:rollup2
FRONTS.

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:59.775 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO DIRECT MY COLLEAGUE

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.544 region:rollup2
SHE'S OUR EXPERT IN.

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:03.279 region:rollup2
HI KIM LADY WITH THE DEPARTMENT.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:04.814 region:rollup2
A FINANCE

01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:07.450 region:rollup2
SOME DON'T LAST FEW BUDGETS HAVE

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:09.252 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:11.120 region:rollup2
A STEM BILINGUAL AND SPECIAL

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:12.121 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.423 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF THE.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:15.191 region:rollup2
GRANTEES HAVE MOVED FORWARD

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:17.293 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:20.263 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS AND PROJECTS THAT

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:22.865 region:rollup2
WILL EMBRACE STEM AM BILINGUAL

01:13:20.263 --> 01:13:24.400 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND YET WE WE TEND TO

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:26.269 region:rollup2
SEE THAT THERE'S STILL A

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.837 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR SPECIAL

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:29.705 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND SO THESE THESE

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:30.606 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS ARE FOCUSED.

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:32.475 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW ONLY ON SPECIAL

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:33.943 region:rollup2
EDUCATION

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:36.512 region:rollup2
I GET THAT BUT WHAT BY WHAT I

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:37.913 region:rollup2
ASKED IS. THE DEED THE BROADER

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:40.149 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS FOR THE RESIDENCY

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:42.952 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WHERE. WHERE THERE ARE

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:43.519 region:rollup2
ON ON ALL AREAS AND IF REVENUES

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:45.254 region:rollup2
WERE AVAILABLE IS THAT IT IS

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:46.489 region:rollup2
THE?

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.156 region:rollup2
?

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:48.958 region:rollup2
THIS ADMINISTRATION OPENED IT TO

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:49.926 region:rollup2
THESE APPROACHES AS WELL HOW

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:52.128 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.696 region:rollup2
THAT. TEACHER RESIDENCY IDEAS IN

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:55.564 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR WE HAVE JUST A NEW

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:57.400 region:rollup2
WANTS ONE FOR THIS TOPIC.

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:58.267 region:rollup2
BUT BUT OVERALL FOR ALL ALL

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.734 region:rollup2
SUBJECT AREAS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.303 region:rollup2
YOU THINK.

DEFICITS A YEAR OR TWO OUT WITH

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:10.626 region:rollup2
A RAPIDLY INCREASING COSTS

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:12.328 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF

HEALTHCAR COSTS.

01:17:14.597 --> 01:17:18.667 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT IS THE YEAR THE END

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:21.036 region:rollup2
IN ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:23.305 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY HERE IS IS THAT? THE

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:24.406 region:rollup2
THE BASE GRANT IS INADEQUATE AS

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:26.809 region:rollup2
AS PART THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:28.444 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA. OF BECAUSE THAT

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:29.545 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY PORTION THAT IF

01:17:28.444 --> 01:17:31.146 region:rollup2
THERE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:17:29.545 --> 01:17:32.948 region:rollup2
USED ON THOSE.

01:17:31.146 --> 01:17:34.350 region:rollup2
RAPIDLY ESCALATING COST

01:17:32.948 --> 01:17:35.718 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:36.252 region:rollup2
WAY WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.653 region:rollup2
FINANCE ITS POSITION AS TO

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:40.422 region:rollup2
THEIR.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:41.757 region:rollup2
VIA.

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:43.259 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE APPARENT REALITY THAT

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:44.393 region:rollup2
THEY WILL ONE DAY IF IF THE

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:45.294 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FINANCE DOES AGREE

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:46.695 region:rollup2
THAT IT THAT THERE ARE.

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:48.631 region:rollup2
.

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:49.865 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS SCHOOL

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:51.600 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT ARE PROJECTING

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:53.502 region:rollup2
DEFICITS A EVEN IN THIS COULD

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.669 region:rollup2
BUDGET TIED TIMES INTO WHETHER

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.837 region:rollup2
WE.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:56.672 region:rollup2
WHERE WAY WHAT IS THE

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:57.673 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROPOSED

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:59.708 region:rollup2
TO?

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:01.911 region:rollup2
WAY WITH THESE THAT WAY WE WENT

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:03.612 region:rollup2
WITH THIS CHALLENGE.

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:04.346 region:rollup2
TRIP UP AARON IDIOT DEPARTMENT

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:06.582 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE AND.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:08.017 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WOULD CERTAINLY

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:09.285 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:11.020 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:13.189 region:rollup2
INCREASING COSTS JUST LIKE MANY

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.924 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET ARM I

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:17.092 region:rollup2
CAN'T SPEAK TO.

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:18.260 region:rollup2
V. THAT YOU AS YOU MENTIONED

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:19.562 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WRECKING

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.763 region:rollup2
DEFICIT STUFF I JUST HAVEN'T I

01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:23.065 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T SEEN IDEA PERSONALLY.

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:23.832 region:rollup2
I THINK OUR RESPONSE THOUGH

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:26.035 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:27.002 region:rollup2
SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THOSE IF

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.870 region:rollup2
F..

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:29.071 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE LISA MENTIONED THAT

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:30.039 region:rollup2
SINCE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE'VE

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:31.941 region:rollup2
NOW WITH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:33.475 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BUDGET AND HAVE A TOTAL

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.944 region:rollup2
OF TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF NEW

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:36.111 region:rollup2
ON GOING MONEY THAT SCHOOL

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:37.346 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AND NOT CHARTER

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:39.014 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BE

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:40.883 region:rollup2
RECEIVING UNDER THE LC FF AND.

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:42.418 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.986 region:rollup2
.

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:45.120 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BASS

01:18:43.986 --> 01:18:46.922 region:rollup2
GRANT TWO VERSES SUPPLEMENTAL

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.856 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION GRANTS I I THINK I

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:49.592 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST POINT OUT AS WELL

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:50.659 region:rollup2
THAT. STATUTE DOES IT IT'S IT'S

01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:52.194 region:rollup2
NOT SO MUCH A SPENDING

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:53.896 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT AS A REQUIREMENT TO

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:54.430 region:rollup2
INCREASE IMPROVE SERVICES SO

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:56.298 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOME.

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:57.733 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW POTENTIAL FOR

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:59.535 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:01.170 region:rollup2
YOU'D BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:02.538 region:rollup2
THEIR EL CAP THROUGH THAT'S YOU

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.906 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THE INTENT THROUGH THE

01:19:02.538 --> 01:19:05.407 region:rollup2
COMEDIAN GAUGE AND PROCESS THAT

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:07.876 region:rollup2
PAY HERE'S HOW WE'RE IMPROVING.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:09.578 region:rollup2
SERVICES FOR THE STUDENTS IT

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:11.580 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:12.982 region:rollup2
SITUATION IT MIGHT NOT BE I

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.749 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE KNOW

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:15.818 region:rollup2
WHAT THE INTENT WITH LOCAL

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.952 region:rollup2
CONTROL IS SO THAT THEY CAN LOOK

01:19:15.818 --> 01:19:18.988 region:rollup2
AT THEIR ALL OF THEIR.

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:21.790 region:rollup2
COST PRESSURES WHATEVER THOSE

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:22.658 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE AND BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:23.559 region:rollup2
THEM IN A WAY THAT SADDAM.

01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:25.227 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NOT HAM STRINGING THEM

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:26.528 region:rollup2
AS I THINK WE WE WOULD VIEW THAT

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:28.530 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS YOU KNOW PRE LCF

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:29.665 region:rollup2
HAVE A STRUCTURE IS WHERE THEY

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:31.367 region:rollup2
DO JUST HAD.

01:19:29.665 --> 01:19:32.935 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL WASN'T SPECIFIC WAYS

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:34.570 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE YOU KNOW HAD TO.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:36.305 region:rollup2
DIRECT THOSE FUNDS AND NOW THEY

01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:38.240 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:39.008 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO SAY SIT BACK AND YOU

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.709 region:rollup2
KNOW BE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:42.077 region:rollup2
BE AT THE THE COMMUNITY

BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:45.681 region:rollup2
THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR FOR THEIR

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:46.949 region:rollup2
NEEDS

01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:48.350 region:rollup2
SO IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.818 region:rollup2
FINANCE SUGGESTING THAT.

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.453 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:52.755 region:rollup2

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:54.456 region:rollup2
PENSION COSTS AND. SPECIAL

01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:55.557 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BECAUSE.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:57.026 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD ARGUE

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:58.427 region:rollup2
THAT SPECIFICALLY AS THE

01:19:57.026 --> 01:20:00.029 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT WHEN I

01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:01.096 region:rollup2

I WAS ME SAY.

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:07.269 region:rollup2
BUT THE SPENDING REQUIREMENT IS

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:07.870 region:rollup2
THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:10.105 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION DOLLARS GO ONLY

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:12.708 region:rollup2
