MAINTENANCE.

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:08.266
COSTS AND IN SOME CASES THE ONE

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.901
TIME INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:11.703
INVESTMENTS I NEED TO GO IN OF

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:14.940
DRINKING WATER.

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:15.874

YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM

00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:18.343
OUR WITNESSES THAT THERE ARE

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.445
OVER MILLION CALIFORNIANS UP AND

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:21.713
DOWN THE STATE.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.381
IRRESPECTIVE OF COMING FROM

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.283
RURAL OR URBAN AREA -- THERE ARE

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.252
WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.454
EVERYWHERE AFFECTING.

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:31.122
FAMILIES IN THE HOUSEHOLDS AND

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:33.525
SCHOOLS WERE OUR CHILDREN SPEND

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.560
THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME -- THE

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:37.062
WAY WE STRUCTURED THIS BILL.

00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:39.331
AS I MENTIONED HAS TAKEN A

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:41.166
NUMBER OF IDEAS HAVE BEEN

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:42.500
DISCUSSED BY.

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:44.936
NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS.

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:47.105
AND ONE IN PARTICULAR TO HELP US

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:49.641
FUND -- THE NEED IS BY

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:51.343
ESTABLISHING THE AGRICULTURAL

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:53.111
FEES THAT MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:55.413
BEEN FAMILIAR WITH.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.315
IN THE EFFORTS THAT UP ASSEMBLY

00:26:57.382 --> 00:26:58.516
MEMBER OR SENATOR MONEY PUT

00:26:58.583 --> 00:26:59.451
FORWARD.

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:00.785
THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY RAISE

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:02.754
CLOSE TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.289
AND THAT -- FEED THAT WOULD

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:07.993
BEGIN IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.127
AT THIS AMOUNT WOULD BE PAID

00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:11.830
ANNUALLY -- TO THE SECRETARY BY

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:14.866
A PRODUCER THAT OWNS MORE THAN.

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:16.401
ONE NON DAIRY CONFINED ANIMAL

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:19.270
FACILITY -- AND SO THE OTHER

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:21.740
APPROACH IS A FERTILIZER FEED.

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:23.675
THAT ALSO WOULD ESTABLISH ITS

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:26.811
COLLECTION AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:29.047
AND AGAIN VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:31.649
WAS SEEN AND SENATE BILL I

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:36.187
BELIEVE. SIX TWO SIX SIX TWO

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:37.522
THREE WE'VE ALSO TAKEN THE IDEA.

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:39.557
THAT MANY WATER AGENCIES HAVE

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.659
PUT FORWARD AND THAT IS THIS

00:27:41.726 --> 00:27:43.528
IDEA OF A FUN.

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:45.897
A REFERRED TO AS A TRUST FUND

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.265
ASKING THE GOVERNOR.

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.167
GIVEN THAT HE HAS MADE THIS

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:51.302
ISSUE A TOP PRIORITY. FOR TWO

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:52.837
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:53.805
NEXT FIVE YEARS.

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:56.474
ARE ALLOWING US TO INTEREST TO

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.109
COLLECT CLOSE TO THIRTY FIVE

00:27:58.176 --> 00:27:59.577
MILLION DOLLARS HELPING US GET

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:02.080
CLOSER TO THAT ONE HUNDRED AND

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:03.681
FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR -- TARGET

00:28:03.748 --> 00:28:08.787
NUMBER -- THERE'S ALSO A CHARGE

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:10.855
TO WATER AGENCIES THAT WE'RE

00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:12.390
REFERRING TO AS THE PUBLIC

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:14.092
BENEFIT WATER FUND.

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.761
THAT WOULD BE IN THE AMOUNT OF

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:19.197
FIFTY CENTS TWO QUARTERS. TWO

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:21.800
PER MONTH PER MONTH PLEASE YES

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:22.400
THANK YOU FOR FOR EMPHASIZING

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:23.968
THAT.

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:26.404
AND WE'VE ALSO INCORPORATED.

00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:28.573
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.675
BECAUSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:33.478
TRUST FUND DISCUSSION -- THAT

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:34.245
HAS BEEN PUSHED BY WATER

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:37.382
AGENCIES -- IT HAS BEEN SAID

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:37.982
THAT WE SHOULD JUST FUND THIS

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:38.950
ISSUE.

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:40.051
THAT IN THAT MANNER USING

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:41.753
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AND I THINK

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.088
THE MAP SAYS THAT.

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:44.689
IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE ONE

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:45.623
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.225
DOLLARS THAT'S NEEDED. FOR THIS

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:49.060
ISSUE YOU HAVE TO PUT A DOWN

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:50.728
PAYMENT INTO THE TRUST FUND IN

00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:51.296
THE AMOUNT OF THREE BILLION

00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:52.597
DOLLARS.

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.299
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:55.366
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IS

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:57.202
COMMITTEE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:58.403
THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.738
HOWEVER.

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:02.874
IN THE BILL WE'VE ADDED SUNSET

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.075
LANGUAGE.

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:06.010
THAT IF IN SOME WAY.

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.779
THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY WAS PUT

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:09.848
FORWARD FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLEAN

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:12.283
WATER THAT WE WOULD SUNSET THESE

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.252
WATER FEES THE TWO QUARTERS.

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:15.820
THAT -- WERE ASKING YOU KNOW

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:18.456
CALIFORNIANS TO PUT INTO THIS

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:19.858
PUBLIC BENEFIT WATER FUND.

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:21.359
IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.328
CLEAN WATER FOR OVER A MILLION

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:24.462
PEOPLE.

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.164
WE'VE ADDED A SECTION IN THE

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.499
BILL.

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:28.833
THAT LOOKS AT THE PROBLEM

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.401
REGIONALLY.

00:29:30.468 --> 00:29:32.370
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE NOT

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.806
JUST CONCENTRATING OUR EFFORTS

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:36.508
ARE INVESTMENTS IN ONE PART OF

00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:37.775
CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:39.878
ENTIRE STATE.

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.446
AS I MENTIONED THIS PROBLEM.

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:44.282
IS OCCURRING IN URBAN AS WELL AS

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:46.918
RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:47.819
NEED TO ENSURE.

THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND TEN

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:10.107
WATER SYSTEMS LOS ANGELES COUNTY

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.777
SOME OF THEM STARTED WHEN THE I

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.011
DEVELOPMENT WOULD COME FROM NO

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:15.546
WHERE AND THEY WOULD.

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:17.181
DEVELOP THE COUNTY WATER SYSTEM

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:18.883
JUST OF A COMMUNITY OR

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.085
HOMEOWNERS VERSION OF A MUTUAL

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:22.653
WATER COMPANY.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.890
I NOW OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND TEN

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:26.657
SIXTY FOUR HAVE A CONCERT

00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:28.159
CUSTOMER BASE WITH THE MEDIAN

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:30.928
HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN 80%.

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:33.631

60% OF MEDIAN INCOME.

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:40.204
THEY CANNOT AFFORD WATER RATES

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:42.073
THAT WILL KEEP THEIR SYSTEM

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:42.840
RUNNING.

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:45.009
AND IF THEY END UP IN AN

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.544
INDEPENDENTLY OWNED UTILITY.

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:48.713
THEY OFTEN GET THEIR WATER SHUT

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:53.518
OFF BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOOD WATER

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:55.987
BUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THEM.

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:56.854
THIS THIS THIS THE SYSTEMS HAVE

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:57.722
A TOTAL OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:58.289
EIGHTY THOUSAND CONNECTIONS

00:35:58.356 --> 00:35:59.790
WHICH ROUGHLY AMOUNTS TO A

BEFORE OR TRY TO GET A HANDLE ON

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.902
THIS SO THE NUMBERS ARE BIG THE

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:11.936
NUMBERS ARE BIGGER.

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.504
THEY'RE CLUSTERED IN TWO PARTS

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.139
OF THE COUNTY WERE POVERTY IS

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:16.807
CLUSTERED IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY.

00:36:16.874 --> 00:36:18.676
IN THE SOUTHEAST SOUTHWEST

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:21.445
REGION OF THE OF THE THE OLDER

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:22.380
PART OF TOWN.

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:24.315
CAPITAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:25.483
OWN AND FUNDING ARE KEY TO ANY

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.652
SOLUTION SO I HAVE. THREE

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:29.086
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU.

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:31.088
THE FIRST IS THAT SOMEWHERE IN

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:33.658
THIS LEGISLATION THAT YOU YOU

00:36:33.724 --> 00:36:35.092
ASKED THE STATE BOARD TO

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:37.895
DETERMINE DAK WATER SYSTEMS.

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:40.431
ON A COUNTY WIDE BASIS RIGHT NOW

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:41.899
THEY LOOK AT CAP AT DETERMINING

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:44.035
ELIGIBILITY WHEN AN ENTITY COMES

00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:45.102
INTO RISK.

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.704
APPLY FOR A GRANT.

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.005
AND THAT'S EASIER TO DO IN A

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:49.807
RURAL AREA THAN IT IS IN URBAN

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.075
FOR A WHOLE LOT OF REASONS.

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:52.610
BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE MOST

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:54.378
ACCURATE PICTURE OF URBAN

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:56.547
SYSTEMS AND IN FACT MOST URBAN

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:58.115
TAX SYSTEMS DON'T KNOW THAT

00:36:58.182 --> 00:36:59.884
THEIR DECK ELIGIBLE YOU HAVE

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.352
ABOUT TEN SECONDS OKAY.

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:02.753
SO I THINK WE THAT SHOULD HAPPEN

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.056
THEY SHOULD INCLUDE THE FUNDING

00:37:05.122 --> 00:37:07.091
SHOULD INCLUDE WORK MONEY FOR

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:08.793
LOCAL AGENCIES TO DO REGIONAL

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.194
DAK ASSESSMENTS AND GOVERNMENT

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.228
STRATEGIES.

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:14.265
AND THE TEN THOUSAND PERSON CAP

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:15.433
FOR ELIGIBLE DAX SYSTEMS NEEDS

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:18.169
TO BE RAISED BECAUSE SMALL IS

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:21.505
BIGGER IN URBAN AREAS.

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:22.873
THANK YOU.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.309
ALL RIGHT UP SO WE HAVE.

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:26.911
JUST TO BE CLEAR OUR WE'RE

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.412
TALKING THE AMENDMENT WE'RE

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:31.682
TALKING ABOUT IS TO ADD -- FIFTY

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.351
CENTS A MONTH.

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:36.354
THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.955
NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS.

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:42.393

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.107
THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:59.043
ADJUSTMENT LATER ON THE NUMBER

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.177

ON THE PART OF THE BILL THAT IS

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:33.577
A NEW PROPOSAL IT'S A DIFFERENT

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:34.444
VERSION OF A WATER TAX.

00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:36.013

ELABORATE ON THAT IN A SECOND.

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:40.217
BUT I I FIRST WANTED TO THINK

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:41.752
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA FOR

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:43.420

EARLIER.

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:48.959
ON BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN WILLING

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:51.628
TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT IDEAS AND

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:53.563
WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.799
AND FOR EXAMPLE AWKWARD IN THE

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:57.701
CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.736
ASSOCIATION ARE SPONSORING A

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:02.172
BILL THIS YEAR SB SIX SIX NINE

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:04.107
BY SENATOR CAFIERO WHICH WOULD

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:05.709
CREATE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:06.710
TRUST.

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.545
AND WIN THE AUTHOR LEARNED ABOUT

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:11.048
THIS PROPOSAL HE WAS INTERESTED

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:13.550
IN IT AND INCLUDED THE OF AN

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.585
IDEA FOR THE TRUST IN THIS BILL

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:19.723
SO WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.992
THE WE THINK THE TRUST PROPOSAL

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:24.094
COMPLIMENTS EXISTING FUNDS

00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:26.730
FEDERAL FUNDING AND BOND FUNDING

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:28.932
IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE AVAILABLE

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.334
FOR CAPITAL COSTS.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.769
AND I THINK WITH THIS BILL IN IN

00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:34.738
LARGE PART IS AIMING TO DO IS

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:36.907
FILL WHERE THERE'S REALLY A GAP

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:38.208
IN THE ABILITY TO FUND THINGS

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.776
AND THAT'S WE CALL IT THE TOUGH

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:41.511
NUT TO CRACK IT'S THE OPERATION

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:43.280
AND MAINTENANCE COSTS YOU CAN'T

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:44.581
USE THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR THAT.

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:46.149
YOU GENERALLY CAN'T USE BOND

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:49.586
MONEY FOR THAT SO WORLD YOU KNOW

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:50.520
TRYING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:52.489
IN OUR VIEW THE TRUST IS

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:56.059
INTENDED AS OF A MECHANISM TO

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:58.328
REPLACE THE WATER TAX IT'S AN

00:49:58.395 --> 00:50:00.230
ALTERNATIVE TO THE WATER TAX WE

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:02.966
WERE INTENDING TO ADD THAT TO

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:03.900
THE WATER TAX.

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.869
SO I I JUST WANTED.

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:08.372
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLEAR

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.407
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:12.109
CIVIC COREY OF OUR OPPOSITION

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:13.877
AGAIN GOES TO THE WATER TAX PART

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:16.346
OF THE BILL WE THINK IT'S NOT.

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:19.149
GOOD POLICY FOR THE STATE TO TAX

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:20.751
SOMETHING LIKE PEOPLE'S TAP

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:23.653
WATER THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.555
WE HAVE A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:27.324
POLICY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:28.892
FOR SAFE WATER BUT IT'S ALSO FOR

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:30.660
AFFORDABLE WATER.

00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:33.497
IN USING A TAX TO FUND A SAFE

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:35.399
DRINKING WATER PROGRAM WILL ADD

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:37.234
TO THE COST WATER ACROSS THE

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.237
STATE IT WILL WORK AGAINST WATER

00:50:40.303 --> 00:50:41.438
AFFORDABILITY.

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.407
THIS WOULD ALSO BE THE PRESIDENT

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:45.175
FOR A STATE TAX ON WATER AND

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:47.911
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER -- INTO

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:49.846
TEASE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:51.615
ALREADY TALKING ABOUT IDEAS THAT

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:52.616
THEY WOULD LIKE TO FIND WITH

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:55.752
ATTACKS ON WATER AND THIS WOULD

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.320
BE THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT.

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:59.089
NO THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:01.291
THE LANGUAGE WE OUTLINED SOME OF

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:02.058
THOSE IN THE LETTER I'M NOT

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:04.494
GONNA CUT TO EVERYONE THAT WE

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:06.630
EXPLAINED IN THE LETTER BUT I'LL

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:08.698
MENTION ONE OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE.

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:11.134
THE BILL AS CURRENTLY AMENDED

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.503
WOULD ALLOW THE USE OF FUNDING

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.205
FOR SYSTEMS THAT HAVE SAFE

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:16.373
DRINKING WATER.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.508
BUT THEIR RATES EXCEED A

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.210
THRESHOLD IN A YOU WATER BOARD

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:22.312
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DOCUMENT

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:25.482
THAT THRESHOLD IS ONE POINT 5%.

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:29.252
OF THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME.

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:31.221
AND YOU HAVE THAT PROVISION IS

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.656
WELL INTENDED.

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:35.292
BUT AS WE SPEAK THE STATE WATER

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:38.528
BOARD IS WORKING ON A A PROGRAM

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:41.264
IT'S THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:42.966
FOUR ONE BY A VENN ASSEMBLY

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.534
MEMBER DIED NOW SENATOR DODD.

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:45.969
WE HAD A MEETING AT THE WATER

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:48.405
BOARD THAT WENT FROM NINE TO

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:50.907
THREE ON FRIDAY ABOUT THIS.

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.576
THE PROGRAM AT THE WATER BOARD.

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:55.111
WOOD THE INTENT OF THAT IS TO

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:57.414
END UP WITH A SUBSIDY FOR WATER

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:59.249
CUSTOMERS AND IT WOULD SUBSIDIZE

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:01.618
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE HOUSEHOLDS

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:02.786
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:04.287
SO THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT'S UNDER

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:06.590
DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW WE SUGGEST

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:08.024
THAT THIS PROGRAM THIS BILL

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:10.560
FOCUS ON WHERE THERE ISN'T SAFE

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:11.862
DRINKING WATER.

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:16.166
SO THAT'S ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE --

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:18.335
JUST CUTTING TO THE CHASE AGAIN

00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:19.503

OTHER THINGS A SOLUTION COMING

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.648
TOGETHER.

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.517

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:55.732
THE START TENSION I MEAN I THINK

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:58.101
WE ALL WANT CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE

00:58:58.167 --> 00:58:59.602

WITH A SHARED GOAL -- ONE QUICK

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:02.805
ONE TECHNICAL QUESTION ON THE

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.040
TRUST IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:05.441
THE LA -- PUT OUT A REPORT

00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:06.910
SAYING THAT THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:08.444
US TO PUT THREE TO FOUR BILLION

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:11.381
DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND MONEY

00:59:11.447 --> 00:59:11.981
AWAY FOR THE TRUST TO WORK IS

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:13.216
THAT RIGHT.

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:16.953
THAT IS CORRECT OKAY -- SO.

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.154
I HAVE CONCERNS FIRST OF ALL THE

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.022
YOUR BILL AND MISTER BLOOM

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:21.024
SPELLER SEPARATE BECAUSE I THINK

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:22.058
THAT.

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.326
THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD NOT

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.862
BOTH COME TO BE LAW WOULD BE.

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.130
SEVERELY PROBLEMATIC THE

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:28.531
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:30.099
MISTER BLOOM SPELL IS.

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:32.769
I THINK NECESSARY TO THIS BILL

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:33.369
AND SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM

00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:35.738
BECOME ONE BILL AND SO WE KNOW

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:36.839
THAT THAT OVERSIGHT

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:38.574
ACCOUNTABILITY WILL GO HAND IN

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:40.576
HAND WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE I

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:42.178
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- THIS

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.079
DIMENSION WEEK.

00:59:43.146 --> 00:59:45.014
HE CAN CONSIDERED JOINING THE

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:47.016
BELLS IRAQ IT'S GOOD FOR THEM TO

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:50.053
BE SEPARATE BUT WE COULD JOIN

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:50.687
THEM WE'LL SEE IF THAT HAPPENED

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:51.054
OKAY [inaudible]

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:51.888
AND I'M.

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:55.792
SO ONE OF MY MAJOR CONCERNS WITH

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:57.627
THIS IS THAT.

00:59:57.694 --> 01:00:00.196
THE UNCLEAN WATER IN MAJORITY OF

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.130
THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.132
FOCUSED ON IS THE RESULT OF

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:04.167
POLLUTION.

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:07.103
IS THE RESULT OF POLLUTION.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.571
DIRECT POLLUTION INTO OUR WATER

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:10.106
SOURCES AND SECONDARILY

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:12.608
RESULTING FROM DRAWING DOWN OUR

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:13.943
GROUNDWATER TO SEVERELY.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.478
AND THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT WE

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:16.779
DRAW DOWN THAT GROUND WATER THAN

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.481
I TRADE BALANCE GETS OFF AND

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:19.782
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IS

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:20.683
HAPPENING HERE.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.852
SO IT IS ACTORS CAUSING THIS

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:24.887
PROBLEM.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.422
AND SO ALTHOUGH.

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:28.091
I WOULD YOU KNOW I WANT TO SEE

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:29.892
CLEAN DRINKING WATER THROUGHOUT

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:32.362
CALIFORNIA I ALSO QUERY IS IT

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:33.930
RIGHT TO HAVE THE RATE PAYERS A

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:36.299
CALIFORNIA PAYING FOR THE

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.066
ACTIONS.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.969
OF THE POLLUTERS AND SO I ALSO

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.504
WONDER IF 30% IS THE RIGHT

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.506
NUMBER -- IF WE REALLY LOOK AT

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:44.874
WHAT ACTIONS ARE CAUSING THIS IS

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.209
IT MORE THAN THAT AND I THINK WE

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.410
NEED TO MAKE SURE THE

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.978
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE.

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:50.413
BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.415
ACTIONS IN THAT THEY ARE -- THE

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.950
ONES RESPONSIBLE TO CLEAN IT UP

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:56.452
AND SECONDARILY I THINK WE NEED.

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:58.087
TO I DON'T WANT US TO JUST BE

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.889
CLEANING DRINKING WATER.

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:01.357
LETTING PEOPLE POLLUTE AND

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:02.658
CLEANING DRINKING WATER WE NEED

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.460
TO ALSO BE WORKING TO STOP THE

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.328
POLLUTION.

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.263
SO THAT MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.598
LAST PROBLEMS WITH CLEAN

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:09.699
DRINKING WATER.

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:11.734
AND SO ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:12.568
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO CLEAN OUR

01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:14.237
WATER I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:16.005
THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE AND AS A

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:18.741
BODY ARE LOOKING VERY HARD AT

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:19.742
WHAT WE ARE DOING THAT IS

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:20.543
CAUSING THIS PROBLEM IN THE

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.078
FIRST PLACE AND GET TO THE ROOT.

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:24.914
CAUSES AND WE'RE PASSING BILLS

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.550
TO FIX THOSE PROBLEMS AS WELL.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:27.717
I'M.

01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:30.620
YOU KNOW I I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.121
AND TO SEE THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.489
AND THE GROWERS ON THE SAME SIDE

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:35.358
IS PRETTY AWESOME SO -- YOU KNOW

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:36.893
THAT'S GOOD TO SEE AND IT'S PART

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:37.727
OF WITH MAKING ME.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.629
I'M MORE COMFORTABLE WITH US

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:40.496
MOVING FORWARD IN THIS

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:41.264
CONVERSATION BECAUSE I KNOW

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.098
YOU'RE WORKING WITH ALL

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.166
INTERESTED PARTIES TO MAKE SURE

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.534
WE GET TO A PLACE.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.204
WHERE THIS BILL IS GOOD -- BUT I

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:50.239
ALSO WANT TO ECHO MAKING SURE

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.908
THAT AS WE HAD IF WE HAD TOWARDS

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.743
APPROPRIATIONS THAT WE GET THE

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.011
NUMBER RIGHT I MEAN WHEN I HEARD

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:56.679
FROM THE CITY'S A MAYBE A THIRTY

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:57.647
TO FIFTY MILLION BUT WE HAVE A

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:58.781
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.316
AGAIN BACK TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.819
THAT WE ARE NOT OVER SUBSCRIBING

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.220
HERE WE'RE REALLY USING THE BOND

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:05.655
MONEY WHERE WE CAN.

01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:08.124
AND ONLY AND USING THESE FUNDS

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:09.058
WHERE WE ACTUALLY NEED THEM FOR

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:09.559
ON GOING.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:13.262
CLEANING -- SO THERE'S A LOT

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:13.963
LEFT TO BE WORKED OUT.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.965
WHICH IS VERY CLEAR AND SO I

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:16.532
THINK THAT YOU KNOW.

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:18.434
I'M.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.769
I WANT IT TO BE CLEAR THAT ANY

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.104
SUPPORT TODAY IS CONTINGENT ON

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.438
THIS STUFF BEING WORKED OUT AND

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:23.639
THEN WE GET TO A SOLUTION THAT

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:26.042
LOOKS TO THE FUTURE OF CLEAN

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:27.844
WATER IN A MUCH BROADER SENSE.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.379
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:32.748

VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES -- WOULD

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.586
BE ALRIGHT IF THEY ANSWER THOSE

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.054
IN THE CLOTHES.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:43.693
EXTENT THAT WE CAN -- ANSWER OUR

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.428
QUESTIONS IN THE CLOTHES UNLESS

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:38.881
BEEN ONGOING WE KNOW THAT THIS

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:40.349
HAS BEEN THE ISSUE BUT I WANT TO

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.817
POINT OUT SOME.

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.219
SOME CLEAR FAX.

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:45.188
SO I HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:47.690
THERE ARE MILLION -- RESIDENTS

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.625
OF CALIFORNIA HAVE.

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.027
AND SPIT DRINKING WATER AND

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.628
THAT'S A FACT WE KNOW THAT

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:54.130
THERE'S IS NITRATES AND AND

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:56.065
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE I AGREE WITH

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:57.700
YOU ON THAT BUT THERE THIRTEEN

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.068
EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SAFE

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:00.136
AFFORDABLE.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:01.070
SOMEWHAT AFFORDABLE DRINKING

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.572
WATER AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:03.539
YOU ALSO THAT.

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:05.408
WE HAVE PASSED A LOT OF

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:08.644
LEGISLATION IN BONDS TO ADDRESS.

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:10.012
THESE ISSUES I MEAN I CAN'T I

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:11.747
SHOULD HAVE GOT A LIST OF SAFE

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.516
DRINKING WATER BOND THE EIGHT

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.184
PROPERTY FOR I CAN GO BACK

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:16.586
TWENTY YEARS AND THE PUBLIC HAS

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:18.387
BEEN PAYING.

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.289
MAYBE NOT ON AN A ON A TAX ON

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.257
WATER.

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:22.458
BUT THEY'VE BEEN PAYING THROUGH

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.327
BONDS WHICH IS THE COMES OUT THE

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.895
GENERAL FUND WHICH IS PAID BY

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:26.896
TAX DOLLARS.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.631
AND SO I'M SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.866
WITH THE FACT THAT WE CONTINUE

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.435
TO COME BACK AND AND FOR MAYBE

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:33.869
IT'S JUST MAYBE FOLKS ON OUR

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:34.804
SIDE OF THE AISLE THAT

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.172
CONTINUALLY YOU ARE ASKED THE

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.006
QUESTION IS.

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.908
YES WE HAVE ISSUE BUT HOW DO WE

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:40.743
SOLVE THAT ISSUE AND HOW DO WE

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.478
ACTUALLY ADDRESS IT WITH.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.680
THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.649
AND DROPPING THE RATE THIS IS

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.551
THIS IS TALKING ABOUT TAXING

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.653
EVERY SINGLE. TO ME DRINKS AND

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.354
AND THE STATE THROUGH WATER

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.090
SYSTEM THAT IS AN ALSO PRODUCERS

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:56.192
LIKE MYSELF WHO USE FERTILIZERS

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:57.493
I'M GONNA BE IT'S ALREADY TAX

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.161
AND WE'RE GONNA ADD TO THAT TAX

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.763
IN THIS LEGISLATION SO.

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.164
IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD FOR ME

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:04.133
TO SWALLOW THIS KNOWING ALL THE

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.401
WHILE THAT I'VE ACTUALLY RAN

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:07.403
PIECES OF LEGISLATION.

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.338
THE LOUD POINT OF USE.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.707
FILTRATION OF WATER AND THE

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.376
BILLS GET KILLED.%

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:14.477
BUT SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:15.711
GROUPS WHO ARE STANDING HERE

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:17.680
SUPPORTING THIS TAX.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.148
WHEN I KNOW THAT THAT WOULD HELP

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:20.983
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.718
AT THE SOURCE AT THEIR HOUSE TO

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.320
GIVE SAFE DRINKING WATER? TO

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:25.988
CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.791
ARE HUNDRED AND FORTY IMPAIRED

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:30.326
WATER SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:32.194
I'M AWARE OF THAT THERE MAY BE

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.596
MORE THAT ARE REALLY NEED.

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.564
SOME FOLKS ON THAT'S WHAT WE

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:35.898
SHOULD FOCUS.

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.166
AND SO.

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:38.401
AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS.

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:40.836
BEEN TAXED A LOT IN THE STATE

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:41.470
AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:41.937
THE STATE.

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:43.306
QUITE FRANKLY WHEN EVERYTHING IS

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:45.274
THE COST OF LIVING IS GOING UP.

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:48.210
AND I JUST DON'T HAVE A A HIGH

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:48.778
LEVEL OF TRUST FOR THE WATER

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:50.012
BOARD.

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.314
NUMBER ONE IN IMPLEMENTING

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.848
WHATEVER PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.517
GETS PUSHED OUT.

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.352
IN A FASHION THAT WILL ACTUALLY

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:57.720
AFFECT THE THOSE THOSE

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:58.888
CONSTITUENTS WHO NEED THEIR

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:00.356
WATER SUPPORTED AND WE'VE SEEN

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:01.891
THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHERE

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:02.591
WE'VE HAD.

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:04.360
LEGISLATION THAT SUPPOSED TO FIX

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:05.861
SOMETHING AND THE MONIES GET

01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:07.363
DIVERTED OFF INTO.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:08.397
ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS THAT

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.332
NO FIX THE PROBLEM AND I'LL GIVE

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:11.567
YOU TWO EXAMPLES THAT ARE JUST

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.469
BLARING IN OUR FACE RIGHT NOW WE

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.137
DID A THERE WAS A TAX FROM

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.839
BATTERIES LAST YEAR FOR EXCITED

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:17.907
MY GOOD FRIEND.

01:06:17.973 --> 01:06:19.342
CRISTINA GARCIA.

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.910
WHO WORKED ON THAT LEGISLATION

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.311
TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.512
WITH THE THE?

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.314
LEAD ISSUES LOOK AT WHAT

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:26.982
HAPPENED DTS TOOK THE MONEY AND

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:29.018
EXPANDED THEIR OFFICES AND IS

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:30.653
NOT GOING TO THE GROUND WHERE WE

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.188
NEED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:32.955
SO I HAVE.

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.290
VERY JUST A LOT OF DISTRUST FOR

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:37.760
THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.129
WHAT WE ASK THEM TO DO NUMBER

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:41.697
TWO WE PASSED HEAVILY USED

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.499
TRACKS ON TRUCKS.

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.000
MANY MANY YEARS AGO TO FIX OUR

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:46.602
ROADS. TO THE TUNE OF A BILLION

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:47.937
DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.305
AND THAT MONEY GOT DIVERTED TO

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.506
THE GENERAL FUND AND TO THIS DAY

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:51.774
IS STILL CONCERT CONVERTED TO

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.409
THE GENERAL FUND.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:54.910
IT IS NOT FIXING OUR ROADS AT

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:55.945
THE SAME TIME CAME BACK TO US

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.880
AND SAID WE NEED TO PASS A TAX

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.582
FOR FUEL WE CAN FIX THE ROADS.

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:02.017
SO I'M JUST I AND I KNOW THAT

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.919
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIX A PROBLEM

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:04.520
THAT IS IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT I

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:05.654
JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH THE

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:07.189
FRUSTRATION THAT.

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:08.691
MANY FOLKS HAVE IN THIS BUILDING

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.659
THAT JUST CAN'T JUST TRUST US

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:11.694
THIS TIME.

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:12.762
WELL I DON'T TRUST YOU THIS TIME

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:15.998
BECAUSE I I HAVE A LIST OF TIMES

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.233
THAT WE'VE BEEN TAX AND DRIVING

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:18.868
UP THE COST TO CALIFORNIANS AND

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:20.569
IT DOESN'T FIX THE PROBLEM.

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:22.972
SO I COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING UP

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.140
FOR I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:25.741
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SPECIAL

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:26.909
INTEREST EVERYWHERE OUT THERE

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:28.144
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY.

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:28.944
WE WANT TO BUILD THE TRUST WITH

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.746
THE PUBLIC OF CALIFORNIA WHEN

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:32.448
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO PAY AGAIN.

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:34.183
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE MONEY

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.584
ACTUALLY FIXES THE PROBLEM AND

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:37.486
IT AND WE FIX IT.

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:38.854
SO THAT IT DOESN'T COST.

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:40.389
MORE THAN IT SHOULD AND IT

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:41.957
THERE'S BEEN SOME OBVIOUSLY

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:43.292
MISSED TALKING SOME OF THE OTHER

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:45.895
ONES HAD SUGGESTED THAT -- MAYBE

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:47.463
WERE WERE GET WE'RE TAXING TOO

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.198
MUCH FOR THE ACTUAL PROBLEM THAT

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.199
NEEDS TO BE FIXED SO I SHARE

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:51.434
THAT WITH YOU I'M GONNA HAVE A

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.102
DIFFICULT TIME SUPPORTING ANY

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.136
LEGISLATION UNLESS.

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:55.438
THERE'S SOME SAFEGUARDS IN IT

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:56.572
THAT SAYS.

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:57.807
THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:59.241
AND THIS IS HOW IT'S GONNA FACT

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:01.677
BECAUSE THE TRACK RECORD OF THIS.

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.412
LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE WHO

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:05.381
IMPLEMENT THE LAWS WE PASS IS

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:06.549
HORRIBLE.

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.584
SO IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL I AGREE

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:09.718

BUT THIS IS IT.

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:10.679

SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:38.374
I THINK THAT -- WITH THIS PIECE

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.576
OF LEGISLATION THERE HAS TO BE

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:43.178
SOME DIRECT THE OVERSIGHT OF

COMMUNITIES ARE -- THE TYPES OF

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.384
PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING PUT

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.686
FORWARD THE COST -- THE TIME

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:52.788

CAN WE PUT THESE BILLS TOGETHER

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:05.434
ABSOLUTELY WE THINK THOUGH -- IT

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:06.835
AT THE CURRENT TIME IT'S IT'S AN

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:08.237
EASIER.

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.672
TASK TO WORK ON THESE IN

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:12.141
PARALLEL -- SO THAT WE CAN DEAL

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:13.876
WITH THE RESPECT STAKEHOLDERS AS

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.444
IT RELATES TO THE MECHANISM AND

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:17.580
THEN OF COURSE THE ACTUAL

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:19.648

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.852
EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUE RELATED TO

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:26.088
ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE -- MONEY

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:28.324
THAT WAS DEDICATED FOR ONE THING

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.792
AND EVENTUALLY ENDED UP IN THE

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:32.261
GENERAL FUND -- YOU OR I WERE

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:34.263
HERE.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.364
MY AND SO WE CAN'T BE HELD

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:37.466
RESPONSIBLE BUT WE ARE

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:38.934
RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW.

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:42.705
THIS NEW FREE ON GAS.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:45.140
IS UTILIZED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:46.609
INVESTMENT AND THE VOTERS ALSO.

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.243
HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:49.378
WEIGH IN ON THAT.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:52.081
AND THEY'RE SAYING WE TRUST YOU

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.415
FOR NOW.

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:55.250
AND STAY THE COURSE AS IT

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.252
RELATES TO IMPROVING OUR ROADS

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:58.387
AND INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THAT

01:10:58.454 --> 01:10:58.587
FEAT.

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:01.390
THE VOTERS SPOKE -- AS IT

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:04.693
RELATES TO THE EXCITED I THINK.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.362
THAT IS A GOOD EXTREMELY

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:07.329
CONCERNING.

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:10.933
AND I HAVE -- FULL CONFIDENCE IN --

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.135
MY COLLEAGUE -- CRISTINA GARCIA

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:16.005
AND I WILL SUPPORTER -- TO TAKE

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:18.340
THE OPIATE COURSE OF ACTION TO

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:20.309
ENSURE THAT THAT MONEY ENDS UP

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:21.810
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE RIGHT.

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.312
LET'S GET BACK TO THE SUBJECT AT

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:25.247
HAND.

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:27.049
YOU MENTIONED BONDS.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.018
WE KNOW THAT BONDS.

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:30.753
ARE NOT ALLOWABLE FOR THE

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:31.754
PURPOSE OF OPERATION AND

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.922
MAINTENANCE.

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:35.924
OF THIS PROBLEM.

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:37.159
WHICH IS WHY IN ALL THE WE

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:39.128
HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:42.264
CONSOLIDATION CONTINUES TO BE.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:44.433
A NUMBER ONE OPTION.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.068
AS IT RELATES TO THE SMALLER

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.003
SYSTEMS THAT CAN NO LONGER BE

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:49.938
SUSTAINED ON THEIR OWN.

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.840
BUT THOSE LARGER SYSTEMS THAT

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:52.775
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:53.876
THE MON [inaudible]

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:56.779
WE'LL NEED. TO HAVE SOME

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:58.514
INCENTIVE.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.383
RIGHT SOME RESOURCES TO BE ABLE

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:02.851
TO TAKE ON THAT OPERATION AND

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.620
MAINTENANCE COSTS.

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:05.154
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS FUND

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.390
FOCUSES ON SO I AM WITH YOU BY

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:11.160
WE WERE THE AUTHOR OF THE LAST

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:11.694
WATER PARK BOND.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.428
THAT.

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:13.929
DIRECTED SOME MONEY FOR WATER

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.632
INFRASTRUCTURE CLEAN WATER BEING

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:17.733
ONE SECTION OF THE BILL BUT IT'S

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.702
NOT ENOUGH.

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:20.669
THE PRIOR WATER BOND WASN'T

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:22.071
EITHER.

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:24.006
IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.374
WAS SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS.

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:27.810
THAT GOES TOWARDS INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:30.179
IMPROVEMENTS AND NOT SO MUCH THE

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:30.846
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE THAT'S

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.715
WHY WE ARE PROPOSING THE TWO

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:34.616
QUARTER.

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:37.386
PUBLIC FUND BENEFIT.

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:39.455
FEE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:42.524
ISSUE -- THAT'S BEFORE US ALL

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:45.527
TURNED TO TO OUR CALL THE GAL

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:45.994
WHO.

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.097
SAYS MANY OF HIS CONCERNS ARE

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.231
ARE.

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.800
DIRECTLY TIED TO HIS POWER CON

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:54.903
AND THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:56.672
WERE THAT -- POLLUTERS SHOULD BE

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:57.940
HELD ACCOUNTABLE I THINK THE

01:12:58.006 --> 01:13:01.076
WATER BOARD IS DOING THAT.

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:03.512
YOU CAN TELL ME IF I'M WRONG --

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.781
IT THE WATER BOARD IS ON TOP OF

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:07.082
THIS ISSUE COULD THEY DO MORE

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.884
MOST DEFINITELY.

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:10.986
AND THE REASON WHY I THINK.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.722
THE AG COMMUNITY IS AT THE TABLE

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.958
WITH US IS BECAUSE THE WATER

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:17.960
BOARD IS THREATENING TO DO MORE.

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:18.894
AS IT RELATES TO HOLDING THEM

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:20.829
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.465
SO -- I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.533
FACT THAT WE ARE APPROACHING

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.969
THIS IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY.

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:28.303
AND WHETHER OR NOT.

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.005
YOU KNOW AG OR ANY OTHER

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.474
INDUSTRY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:36.378
PORTION -- THE NUMBER WAS 30% IF

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:37.446
IT'S MORE THAN IT SHOULD BE

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:40.149
REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNT THAT'S

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:42.017
BEING PUT ON THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.853
CLEAN THIS UP BUT BUT ULTIMATELY.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.522
YOU KNOW I WANT TO SAY THAT I

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:48.023
DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE COMMENTS

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:48.957
THAT WERE MADE.

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:50.726
AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:52.895
THAT CONVERSATION TODAY WE HAVE

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.463
HANDFUL OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:57.366
HAVE ACCEPTED -- TO THEN MOVE ON

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.301
TO IDENTIFYING THE ACTUAL.

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:00.702
AMOUNT.

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.838
OF THE PROBLEM AND ULTIMATELY

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:04.473
HAVE APPROPRIATIONS.

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.842
HELP US BEGIN NARROWING DOWN THE

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:09.845
SCULPTOR -- BUT THE COMMENTS ARE

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:12.548
WELL TAKEN WELL NOTED AND AS WAS

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:13.382
MENTIONED EARLIER.

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:15.651
ON WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.886
WITH EVERYONE WHO HAS STOOD UP

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:20.122
IN OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL AND

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:21.190
I KNOW THAT.

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:23.692
YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME WATER

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:24.860
AGENCIES.

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.528
WHO WILL GO ON NAME WHO HAVE

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.063
COME TO MEET WITH US AND HAVE

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.233
PUT FORWARD SOME IDEAS SOME

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.768
SOLUTIONS AS IT RELATES TO

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:35.370
MECHANISMS ON HOW TO ADMINISTER?

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:38.307
COLLECTED AND SEND THE FEEDBACK.

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:40.042
TO THE STATE IN ORDER FOR IT TO

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:42.444
END UP IN THE FUN -- TO CLEAN UP

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.146
THESE WATER SYSTEMS IN SPECIFIC

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:47.516
PARTS OF THE STATE SO WE ARE.

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:49.084
HEARING YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.452
AND YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN MENTIONED

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.855
THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL OR OR A

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:53.188
TOUGH ISSUE.

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:55.624
IT SHOULDN'T BE.

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.693
THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.094
IN SCHOOLS -- THAT DON'T HAVE

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.963
CLEAN DRINKING WATER THAT SHOULD

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.331
NOT BE CONTROVERSIAL OR A TOUGH

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.166
ISSUE.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.567
WHEN WE USE THE WORD TAX OF

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.970
COURSE IT SCARES US IN?

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.872
FOLKS -- ON WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.640
WE CAN SUPPORT THIS OR NOT THIS

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.842
IS A OF FEET. TO BENEFIT THE

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:15.177
PUBLIC.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.612
RIGHT AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:18.981
BETWEEN THE TAX AND AND THE FEE

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.115
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:24.152
TAXES FOR GENERAL SERVICES A

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:25.354
FEES WERE SPECIFICALLY.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.489
ADDRESSING A SPECIFIC NEED IN

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:30.125
AREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAYING

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.927
THE FEE AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:34.296
FOR SOMEONE TO SAY I DON'T HAVE

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.497
THIS PROBLEM IN MY DISTRICT I

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.599
KNOW -- THERE ARE.

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:39.034
STANDARDS.

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:41.136
THAT TO CONTINUE TO BE ELEVATED

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.271
AT THE WATER BOARD.

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:44.873
THAT ARE PUTTING SYSTEMS OUT OF

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.576
COMPLIANCE EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:49.378
AND THAT REQUIRES.

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:51.747
RESOURCES TO BUILD THE ADEQUATE

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:53.382
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY.

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:55.017
AND MAYBE IT'S THE TEMPORARY

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:57.486
APPROACH OF USING POINT OF USE

01:15:57.552 --> 01:15:59.454
FILTRATION SYSTEMS AS WE DO IN.

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:01.156
THE COACHELLA VALLEY TO ADDRESS

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:02.524
THE ISSUE OF ARSENIC.

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:05.160
BUT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION IS TO

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.061
CONNECT THEM TO CENTRALIZE

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.497
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.065
SO THAT EVERYONE.

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.601

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:14.269

WITH PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.397
INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL TWO

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.398

ON THE POLLUTION ISSUE THAT WAS

01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:25.907
RAISED EARLIER WE A 100% AGREE

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.176
THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTY SHOULD BE

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:34.016
ON THE TRUST ISSUE OF THE NUMBER

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:35.951
OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.120
CAME UP EARLIER I AM THAT WAS A

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:39.321
NEW NUMBER TO ME.

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:40.889
LAST YEAR THE NUMBER WAS A

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:41.757
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION I

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.592
THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:45.127
WAS TRYING TO RAISE BUT

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:46.895
REGARDLESS.

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:49.564
AS OUR MISTER KWOK WHO TESTIFIED

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.033
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCES ON

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:52.868
THE MONEY THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.069
AT APPROPRIATIONS.

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:56.071
BUT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE MOST

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:58.006
RECENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT THE

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.275
STATE WATER BOARD IS ISSUED --

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:01.743
FOR IN M. FOR NITRATE AND OTHER

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:04.179
CHEMICALS IT WAS FORTY THREE

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:06.281
POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS YOU

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.916
ADD MONEY FOR CONSOLIDATION

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:10.919
MAYBE YOU GET TO FIFTY MILLION --

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:13.055
THAT TRANSLATES TO A TRUST OF

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:15.223
ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.225
THAT COULD BE FUNDED OVER ONE

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:19.161
TWO OR THREE YEARS FOR EXAMPLE

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.729
SUGGESTIVE GET THAT INFORMATION

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:22.130
OUT THERE.

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:23.632
AND FINALLY.

01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:26.134
THE WAY THE NEW ON THE BE

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.203
MECHANISM THAT'S BEEN REFERRED

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:32.707
TO IS WRITTEN IT IS A TAX UNDER

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:34.342

YOUR NUMBERS AGAIN -- THAT WILL

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:40.248
BE DETERMINED IN APPROPRIATIONS

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:42.250
ARE WE JUST LOOKING AT POLICY

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:45.120
HERE -- SO MISTER MURATSUCHI I

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:47.355

IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT AS FAR

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.005
AS I'M CONCERNED IT'S NOT

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:04.940
CONTROVERSIAL.

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:06.141
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SAFE

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.877
DRINKING WATER FOR ALL SO THE

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:11.480
QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THERE --

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:14.483

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:34.136
DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF THE

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:34.636
AMOUNT.

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:37.572
NEEDED INTO THAT THE DOLLARS ARE

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.007
WELL SPENT.

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:40.242
YOU KNOW ALONG THE LINES OF

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:40.842

SPENT I I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:46.148
THE AS BARRACK QUE AND THAT --

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:47.382

SO MR GARCIA.

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:32.661
BY ON THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:34.629
MAKING SURE THAT THE POLLUTERS

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:38.099
YEAH YOU YOU RESPONDED THAT TO

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.267
THAT THE WATER BOWL BOARD IS

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.403
HOLDING THE POLLUTERS

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:44.606

WE HAVE -- THEY ARE THE

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:52.180
REGULATORS.

01:20:52.247 --> 01:20:53.815
AND WE PASSED POLICY THAT THEN

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:56.284
THEY IMPLEMENT.

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.953
RIGHT AND SO THEY ARE --

01:20:58.019 --> 01:21:01.323
RESPONSIBLE DIRECTLY FOR

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:03.959

THAT ARE OUT OF STATE COMPLIANCE

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:09.998
REGULATIONS -- THAT'S THE THE

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:12.867
BASES OF MY MY STATEMENT.

01:21:12.934 --> 01:21:15.237

ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROBLEM

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:22.544
FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WE ARE

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:24.813
ESTIMATED IN THIS BILL THEN THIS

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.348
BILL OUGHT TO REFLECT THAT.

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:27.782
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:30.085
OKAY -- SO ALONG THOSE LINES I

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:33.121
MEAN I I I I I AM ALL FOR WHAT

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:33.722

CORRECTED CONTINUES TO BE ONE

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:49.698
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:49.931
DOLLARS.

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:51.599
TOM.

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:52.467
COULD THE NUMBER CHANGE IT COULD

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:53.535
FROM NOW.

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:54.769
TO THE APPROPRIATIONS BASED ON

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.104
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.372
WATER BOARD.

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.873
THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER SYSTEMS

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.142
AND OTHER PLACES OF THE STATE --

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.177
THAT NEED TO BE INCORPORATED

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:05.080
INTO THIS EQUATION THIS IS BASED

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.382
ON THE MOST RECENT AND AVAILABLE

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:10.251
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE -- AKA

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:11.453
REPRESENTATIVE HAS MENTIONED

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:13.188
THAT THE ESTIMATE AT ONE POINT

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:15.056
WAS IN THE FORTY FIFTY MILLION

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:17.525
DOLLARS CONSIDERING THE CLEAN UP

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:19.627
OF NITRATES -- AND THE

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:23.131
CONSOLIDATION -- WHAT WE WANT TO

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:25.633
MAKE SURE IS THAT -- NOT

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.702
EVERYONE HERE NOT EVERYONE IN

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:30.739
CALIFORNIA IS FACING THE SAME

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:32.374
PROBLEM WITH NITRATES -- THERE

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.842
ARE SCHOOLS IN DIFFERENT PARTS

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:35.777
OF CALIFORNIA THAT FACE THE

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.645
PROBLEM OF LET.

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:39.514
THERE ARE OTHER RURAL

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:41.082
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T FACE THE

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:42.283
ISSUE OF NITRATES BUT HAVE HIGH

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.953
LEVELS OF ARSENIC AND CHROMIUM.

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.821
SIX AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:49.124
THAT IF WE'RE ASKING.

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.425
ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PITCH IN TO

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:51.526
THIS PROBLEM.

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:52.627
THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:55.063
OPPORTUNITY TO TAP INTO THIS FUN.

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.265
AND ADDRESS THEIR CLEAN WATER

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.767
PROBLEMS IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD.

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.935
OKAY SO ALONG THAT POINT THE DO

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:02.404
YOU HAVE.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:05.807
DATA INDICATING WHAT PERCENTAGE

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.844
OF THESE -- NOW.

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.880
OPERATIONAL MAINTENANCE COSTS

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:14.082
ARE AND ACT AND IN AN

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:15.650
AGRICULTURAL AREAS VERSUS URBAN

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:16.885
AREAS.

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:19.254
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ON

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.889
ME I I DON'T HAVE THAT OKAY THAT

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:22.757
WE WILL FOLLOW UP ON ALL RIGHT

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:25.260
SO -- BAG I I I APPRECIATE.

RESPECT THAT -- BUT THAT'S GOING

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:34.936
TO BE ONE OF THE THE THE THE

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.171
QUESTIONS THAT I'M GOING TO BE

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:37.539
LOOKING.

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:40.008
FOR IS -- YOU KNOW I MEAN I I I

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.176
SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.477
MR DOLLY HAS I WANT TO I WANT TO

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:45.013
MAKE SURE THAT THE THOSE DOLLARS

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:45.613
ARE BEING WELL SPENT THAT IT'S

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.481
NOT JUST.

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:47.715
TO A POLITICAL PITCH TO THROW IN

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:49.417
LA COUNTY AND AND TALK ABOUT HOW

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:51.152
THIS IS URBAN PROBLEM RATHER

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:53.421
THAN JUST ROLL PROBLEM.

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:56.090
OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW.

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:58.026
AGAIN I I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

01:24:58.092 --> 01:25:00.028
IN IN VOTING FOR ATTACKS IF IF

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:01.129
IF FIND.

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:02.530
IN A SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:08.236
COULD BE WELL SPENT -- THE SO SO

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:10.839
YOU KNOW IN IN IN IN IN TERMS OF

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.373
MAKING SURE THAT POLLUTERS PAY A

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.509
MEANING.

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:15.543
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WITH

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:18.480
JACKING UP WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:20.181
FOR FOR THE YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:21.616
THE FOR THE DAIRY FOR THE

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:24.219
FERTILIZER FOR FOR AGRICULTURE.

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:26.521
IF THAT'S GOING TO YOU KNOW MAKE

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:27.922
SURE THAT THEY ARE PAYING THEIR

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:29.891
FAIR SHARE I I THINK THAT'S THE

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:31.493
THE THE THE THE DRIVING

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:32.927
PRINCIPLE THERE ARE ARE THEY

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.996
BEING ASKED TO TO PAY THEIR FAIR

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:37.665
SHARE -- SO THAT AGAIN RATE

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:40.034
PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS ARE.

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:41.436
ARE ARE ARE NOT YOU KNOW.

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:42.604
PAYING FOR THE POLLUTERS AND

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:43.771
THAT THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.673
THAT I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING --

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.242
FOR AS AS AS I'M GOING TO AS

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:55.250
THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD -- I

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:56.918
TALKED ABOUT -- HOW I GOT A --

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.553
BE LOOKING -- FOR YOU KNOW

01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.387
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:01.623
RELIABLE SET OF COSTS THAT.

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:03.258
TO THAT AND THAT THIS BILL IS IS

01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:07.362
IS BEING BASED ON AND I'M YOU

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:10.498
KNOW I I I WANT TO SHARE -- THE

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.600
CONCERNS OF IT MISS TALK IN IN

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:13.902
TERMS OF THIS BEING A PRECEDENT

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:15.570
I MEAN IT IT IT BOTHERS ME THAT

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:17.005
WE'RE AT YOUR SETTING A

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:18.573
PRECEDENT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.710
TAXING WATER -- AND AND THAT'S

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:24.212
WHY AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.346
THAT YOU KNOW THEY THE

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:26.714
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL.

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:27.916
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.417
DOLLARS ARE BASED ON SOLID

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:32.320
NUMBERS -- AND THAT AGAIN --

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:34.088
WHERE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TO

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:38.426
PAYING FOR THE POLLUTERS -- SO

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:39.460
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.195
THAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THANK

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:47.235
YOU THANK YOU.

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:49.037
OKAY A SETTLEMENT -- HOLD HOLDEN

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:50.138
HAS SOME QUESTIONS I BELIEVE DID

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.005
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD MISTER

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:52.507
GARCIA BEFORE ONE OF OUR ONE OF

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:53.775
OUR WITNESSES WANTED TO KINDA

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:54.876
OKAY I I'M SORRY MR HOME WOULD

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:57.078
YOU MIND HOLDING ON AND LETTING

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.279
HER DRESS SOME OF THOSE THANK

01:26:58.346 --> 01:26:58.479
YOU.

01:26:58.546 --> 01:26:58.813
THE MANAGER.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.081
I LIKE TO JUST ADD I THINK IT'S

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:01.516
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.384
UNDERSTAND THAT DRINKING WATER

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:04.986
CONTAMINATION HAS A VARIETY OF

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.287
DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS.

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:08.022
AND I WILL SAY THE FACT THAT

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.491
WE'RE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT --

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:11.759
TAXING AGRICULTURE AND THERE AT

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.661
THE TABLE THEY RECOGNIZE THEY'VE

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.730
CONTRIBUTED TO CONTAMINATION.

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:16.731
AND THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:17.632
SOLUTION WHICH IS REALLY

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.100
HISTORIC.

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.134
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:21.035
RECOGNIZE THAT AND THE

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:21.703
CONTAMINANT THAT'S PART

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:23.071
PRIMARILY A BIGGEST SOURCE OF

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:24.172
CONTAMINATION FROM THE INDUSTRY

01:27:24.238 --> 01:27:25.573
IS NITRATES.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.041
NOW THAT SAID NEDRY DOES NOT THE

01:27:27.108 --> 01:27:28.910
ONLY CONTAMINANT THAT WERE FACED

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.144
WITH SO SOME OF THOSE FEES A

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.446
WILL COME FROM THE INDUSTRY WILL

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:31.646
HELP.

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:33.414
SOLVE THE STE THE PROBLEM WHERE

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:34.749
WE DO HAVE NITRATES.

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.417
THE REALITY IS THAT AS WAS

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:37.485
MENTIONED BY OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:38.620
GARCIA IS WE HAVE OTHER

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:42.323
CONTAMINANTS THAT WE ALSO HAVE

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.058
TO ADDRESS.

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.526
SUCH AS ARSENIC ONE TWO THREE T.

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:47.028
C. P. URANIUM BACTERIA PER

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:47.929
GLORIA IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:49.097
AND FOR THOSE CONTAMINANTS WE TO

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.431
FIGURE OUT A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:52.500
OF FUNDING. FOR THE OPERATION

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:54.002
AND MAINTENANCE MAINTENANCE OF

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:54.469
THIS CONTENT ARE THESE

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:55.637
CONTAMINANTS.

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:56.938
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:59.007
RECOGNIZE THAT YES WE PASSED A

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.475
LOT OF FUN A BOND FUNDING BUT

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.176
NONE OF IT GOES TOWARDS THE

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.112
BIGGEST GAP WHICH IS OPERATION

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:04.779
AND MAINTENANCE AND THIS IS WHAT

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:07.281
THIS BILL WILL HELP ACHIEVE.

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:08.583
I ALSO JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:10.051
THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT SHORT TERM

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:13.321
SOLUTIONS LIKE THESE POINT OF

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:14.088
USE DEVICES.

01:28:14.155 --> 01:28:14.856
I'M VERY CAUTIOUS WITH THAT

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:16.391
BECAUSE WHEN YOU INSTALL A

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:18.092
FILTER IN SOMEONE'S HOME.

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.127
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:20.962
PERSONS MAINTAINING THE FILTER

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.363
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MAINTAIN

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.964
THOSE FILTERS THE FILTRATION

01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:24.932
DEVICES IT ACTUALLY INCREASES

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:26.100
THE CONCENTRATION.

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.301
NOW I WILL SAY THAT WERE

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:28.536
ACTUALLY TESTING SOME PRIVATE

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:30.738
WELLS AND THE CENTRAL COAST AND

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:33.174
I'M SEEN SIX TIMES THE LEVEL OF

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:34.542
NIGHT TREATS THAT ARE THAT ARE

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:35.910
LIMITED IN OUR DRINKING WATER.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:36.944
THERE'S CLEARLY NO CERTIFIED

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:39.380
DEVICE TO REDUCE THAT LEVEL OF

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.715
CONTAMINATION.

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:41.883
THERE'S OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE WE

01:28:41.949 --> 01:28:43.518
HAVE MULTIPLE CONTAMINANTS LIKE

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:45.720
PER GLORIA AND NITRATES THERE'S

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:47.455
NO SOARED BY POINT OF USE THAT I

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:49.390
KNOW OF THAT CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:50.625
THAT LEVEL OF CONCENTRATION NOW

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:52.293
I JUST WANT TO SAY.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.530
THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:58.800
HAVE THE NEED GAS -- CLINICS

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:00.501
WERE MEMBERS GOAL IN THE CLINICS

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:01.969
IN THEIR WATER FOUNTAINS.

01:29:02.036 --> 01:29:03.771
WE HAD TO INSTALL A POINT OF

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:04.305
USED DEVICE BECAUSE WE HAD

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:04.939
ARSENIC SO YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:05.773
TO GET BETTER BUT THE FOUNTAIN

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:06.708
AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE HAS

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:07.608
ARSENIC.

THAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:05.927
ACCOMPLISH.

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:07.061
WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS -- IN

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.930
THE MANY ANALYSIS.

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.264
WHERE IT IS ON PAGE TWELVE

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:12.433
REFERRING TO POTENTIAL

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.868

AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE.

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.494
THAT MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.196
ALREADY TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS --

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:50.298
TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:51.565
CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:52.767
CALIFORNIANS IN.

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:55.202
SOME OF THE BALLOT MEASURES THAT

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:59.573
HAVE BEEN PASSED -- WE JUST.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.942
WITH THAT LAST YEAR WE JUST

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:02.810
PASSED THE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:04.912
SOME OF THESE WATER -- DISTRICTS

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:06.013
TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THEY

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.214
WEREN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE CLEAN

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:09.784
DRINKING WATER SINCE THAT TIME

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:12.420
SINCE THE BILL WAS PASSED. ONE

01:33:12.486 --> 01:33:13.788
HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED.

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:16.624
THAT'S IT SO WHEN ASSEMBLYMAN

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:18.392

01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:20.695
MISTRUST OF HOW THIS PROCESS IS

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:21.862
GOING TO PLAY OUT I HAVE TO

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.597
AGREE AND I THINK EVERYONE IN

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:24.198
THIS ROOM SHOULD BE A LITTLE

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.266
SUSPECT.

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:26.600
OF YOU KNOW I MIGHT START OFF

01:33:26.667 --> 01:33:28.169
WITH GREAT INTENTIONS BUT IN THE

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:31.305
END DOES IT TURN OUT THE WAY WE

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:35.810
EXPECTED -- THERE'S DISCUSSION

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:38.512
ABOUT IS THAT IT IS A TAX IS A

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:42.850
FEE -- IT'S A TAX.

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:44.251
IT'S A TAX IN AND I AND I DON'T

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:45.786
KNOW HOW.

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:47.521
THIS MAY PLAY OUT ON THE COURT I

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:48.923
DON'T KNOW WATER IS IN THIS IS

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:50.458
IT IS A HUMAN RIGHT.

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:52.660
RIGHT DON'T WE WE AGREE ON THAT

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:55.229
WATER IS A RIGHT SO I DON'T.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:56.464
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:57.598
RATIONALIZING THIS IN MY HEAD

01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:59.800
HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAX SOMETHING

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:01.335
THAT IS A RIGHT -- HOW THAT

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:04.672
THAT'S NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL --

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:05.573
WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M SURE

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:06.841
YOU'VE CONTEMPLATED AND I'M SURE

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:07.742
YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS

01:34:07.808 --> 01:34:09.110
PROCESS BUT I WILL TELL YOU FROM

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.378
MY OWN PERSPECTIVE.

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:12.213
EVEN NOW I'M SURE YOU MAY ASSUME

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:13.381
THAT JUST BECAUSE I'M A

01:34:13.447 --> 01:34:14.949
REPUBLICAN EVERY TIME I HEAR THE

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.283
WORD TAX THAT.

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:17.785
YOU KNOW MY BLOOD STARTS TO CURL

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:20.087
THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT I WILL TELL

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:22.490
YOU THAT AS A AS A AS A SOMEONE

01:34:22.556 --> 01:34:24.025

YOURS. TO DEFEND THE TAXPAYERS

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:28.029

THIS SERIOUSLY AS TO WHETHER OR

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:32.666
NOT IT'S TAX -- FEE AND NOT GET

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:34.602
BATTLE AND LET THE COURTS DECIDE

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:37.538
WHAT THE INTENT WAS AND WHAT

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:38.506
THIS ACTUALLY IS [inaudible]

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:39.907
I'M.

01:34:39.974 --> 01:34:43.077
I MEAN ASK YOU STRAIGHT OUT.

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:44.779
BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD RUMORS IN

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:46.647
THEY MAY JUST BE THAT RUMORS BUT

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:48.315
I HAVE HEARD RUMORS THAT.

01:34:48.382 --> 01:34:49.884
AT SOME POINT.

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:51.185
THIS BILL IS GOING TO CHANGE AND

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:53.020
SOMETHING WILL BE INSERTED THAT

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:55.322
WILL EXEMPT -- LOW INCOME

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:57.158
CALIFORNIANS FROM PAYING THIS

01:34:57.224 --> 01:34:59.393
TAX OR FEE WHICH EVERYONE A

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.795
COLLEGE IS THAT YOUR INTENTION.

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:03.030
SO WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:04.298
MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE ARE

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.466
MECHANISMS.

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:08.936
THE WEEK IN INTEGRATE INTO THE

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:10.271
BILL TO PROTECT DOLE'S.

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:13.441
WHO COULD LEAST AFFORD TO PAY?

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:15.309
WHAT DO SO AND WILL USE POVERTY

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.444
LINE?

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:18.379
UP PERCENTAGES RIGHT UP BUT I

01:35:18.446 --> 01:35:19.713
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT.

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.449
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HEARD FROM

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:27.321
TODAY IN THAT CATEGORY -- AS IT

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:30.257
RELATES -- TO INCOME LEVELS.

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.793
AND THEY'RE HERE SAYING THAT

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:33.360
WE'RE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:36.330
ALREADY. FOR DIRTY WATER.

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:37.698
AND WE DON'T MIND PAYING TWO

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:40.734
QUARTERS -- IF THE GOVERNOR DOES

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:42.069
HIS PART AND PUTS DOWN THE BIG

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.305
DOWN PAYMENT.

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:45.806
AND THEN INDUSTRY.

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:47.475
DOES THEIR PART AND PAY THOSE

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:48.275
FEES.

01:35:48.342 --> 01:35:49.543
OF THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:52.046
PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT I GUESS.

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:53.547
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT'S NOT

01:35:53.614 --> 01:35:56.617
A RUMOR WE ARE EXPLORING --

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:58.819
LANGUAGE MECHANISMS THAT WOULD

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:01.422
CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:03.257
US CERTAIN POPULATIONS ARE FROM

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:46.793
POISONS.

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:47.961
THE EFFECTS OF ANTI COAGULANT

01:52:48.027 --> 01:52:48.761
ARE INSIDIOUS.

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:50.330
ANIMALS AFFECTED SLOWLY LOSE BUT

01:52:50.396 --> 01:52:51.564
THEY'RE A SMALL WOUND OR INTO AN

ORDER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

01:52:55.068 --> 01:52:56.236
WHICH MEANS THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:52:56.302 --> 01:52:57.570
PATIENTS ACTUALLY MAKE IT TO MY

01:52:57.637 --> 01:52:59.539
EXAM TABLE LIKELY FAR

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:01.174
UNDERESTIMATES HOW MANY.

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:02.976

01:53:03.042 --> 01:53:04.210
IN THE WILD.

01:53:04.277 --> 01:53:05.712

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:10.850
THE LAST PIECE I RELEASE WAS AN

ON A TOE THAT WAS LESS THAN FIVE

01:53:17.323 --> 01:53:18.258
MILLIMETERS LONG.

01:53:18.324 --> 01:53:20.093
ONCE YOU PRESENTED TO ME SHE WAS

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.661
TOO WEAK TO STAND OR EVEN OVER

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:22.595
OPEN OUR EYES.

01:53:22.662 --> 01:53:24.564
SADLY IN MY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:27.467

POISON AND RESTORE CAN THE

01:53:37.076 --> 01:53:38.244
STATE'S US.

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:39.412
I'VE SEEN ANIMALS BLEED INTO

01:53:50.089 --> 01:53:52.192
PERMANENT DISABILITIES.

01:53:52.258 --> 01:53:53.226
HOWEVER THE FULL EXTENT TO WHICH

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:54.227
THIS POISON HAS IMPACTED

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:55.195
WILDLIFE IS LIKELY

01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:56.362
UNDERESTIMATED.

01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:57.163
WHAT KIND OF WAR SUCH AS BOBCATS

ANTICOAGULANTS?

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:01.801

A VERY CAREFUL EVALUATION OF

02:06:52.237 --> 02:06:53.906
WHAT TO THE CAUSE OF BEEN AND

02:06:53.973 --> 02:06:56.041
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME --

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.476
WE'VE DEALT WITH A FIRST

02:06:57.543 --> 02:06:59.411
GENERATION AND AND AND NOW

02:07:12.424 --> 02:07:13.993
OF MADAM VICE CHAIR.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OKAY

02:07:15.494 --> 02:07:17.062
SO I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:19.398
QUESTIONS FOR YOU YOU GUYS --

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:22.634
YOU SAID THAT YOU YOUR ISSUES

02:07:22.701 --> 02:07:24.937
WITH THE STRATEGY.

02:07:25.004 --> 02:07:26.672
WHAT DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY?

02:07:26.739 --> 02:07:27.973
THE YEAH JUST THAT'S CORRECT SO

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.074
THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN

02:07:29.141 --> 02:07:32.411
REQUIRES TO AGENCIES TO SIGN OFF

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:35.247
BEFORE -- THESE RED INSIDES ARE

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:37.750
EMPLOYED IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:39.018
AND THAT'S THE THE COUNTY

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:40.419
COMMISSIONERS AND ALSO THE

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:41.720
PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY.

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:43.789
AND SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:45.224
NEITHER OF THESE AGENCIES.

02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:46.759
ARE -- THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:48.660
LANGUAGE THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE

02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:50.062
THE DETERMINATION.

02:07:50.129 --> 02:07:51.463
THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFF THEY

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:53.298
NEED TO MEET THE VOLUME BECAUSE

02:07:53.365 --> 02:07:54.133
THEY'RE COULD LITERALLY BE

02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:55.968
HUNDREDS OF CALLS PER DAY AT

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:57.302
LEAST PER WEEK.

02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:59.004
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING

02:07:59.071 --> 02:08:00.139
FOR THE STAFF THAT WOULD THEY

02:08:00.205 --> 02:08:01.874
WOULD NEED FOR THE INCREASE OF

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:02.474
THIS AND THAT'S WHY I SUSPECT

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:03.876
THAT THE THAT THE AG

02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:05.144
COMMISSIONERS ARE HERE WITH US

02:08:05.210 --> 02:08:07.579
AT THE TABLE SO -- THE THE OTHER

02:08:07.646 --> 02:08:08.480
ISSUE WE HAVE WITH THIS

02:08:08.547 --> 02:08:10.582
PARTICULAR STRATEGY IS IT'S FULL

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:12.317
OF EXEMPTIONS FOR AGRICULTURE

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:13.786
AND AREAS.

02:08:13.852 --> 02:08:15.721
AND WE FEEL LIKE THE

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.756
REEVALUATION COULD -- ENACT

02:08:17.823 --> 02:08:20.092
SOLUTIONS IN THE FIRST SIX TO

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:22.394
TWELVE MONTHS WITH THE

02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:22.928
INTERMEDIATION.

02:08:22.995 --> 02:08:23.462
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THESE

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:24.763
RESTRICTIONS I THINK WE'LL HAVE

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:25.664
BETTER SOLUTIONS COMING OUT OF

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:27.766

CAN THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN GO

02:08:40.312 --> 02:08:41.880
BUY IT.

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:43.048
AT THIS POINT AND THE ANSWER IS

02:08:43.115 --> 02:08:43.382
NO.

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:45.050

DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE

02:08:46.852 --> 02:08:49.321
REGULATION ON IS -- IS ONLINE

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:51.123
INTERNET SALES -- BECAUSE THEY

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:54.793
THAT IS -- THAT'S AN UNREGULATED

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:57.463

THIS PERSON PROPOSAL AND I'M

02:45:35.325 --> 02:45:37.460
STOPPING THERE AND SEATING IF

02:45:37.527 --> 02:45:40.430
POSSIBLE MY IT'S TIME.

02:45:40.497 --> 02:45:43.033
TO ANNA RATE -- GOOD AFTERNOON

02:45:43.099 --> 02:45:45.468
CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU --

02:45:45.535 --> 02:45:46.036
MY NAME IS ANNA READ I'M A

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:46.603
SCIENTIST WITH THE NATURAL

02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:48.438
RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL.

02:45:48.505 --> 02:45:49.773
SCIENTISTS AND HEALTH OFFICIALS

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:51.274
AROUND THE WORLD -- HAVE

02:45:51.341 --> 02:45:52.776
EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THIS

02:45:52.842 --> 02:45:54.344
CRYING CLASS OF SYNTHETIC

02:45:54.411 --> 02:45:56.379
CHEMICALS FOR SEVERAL REASONS

02:45:56.446 --> 02:45:57.814
THEY'RE VERY PERSISTENT WHICH

02:45:57.881 --> 02:45:58.815
MEANS THEY DON'T BREAK DOWN THE

02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:00.617
HIGHLY MOBILE WHICH MEANS THAT

02:46:00.684 --> 02:46:01.551
THEY SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR

02:46:01.618 --> 02:46:03.019
ENVIRONMENT VERY QUICKLY.

02:46:03.086 --> 02:46:03.887
AND THE ONES THAT WOULD HAVE

02:46:03.953 --> 02:46:05.188
BEEN STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A WIDE

02:46:05.255 --> 02:46:06.890
VARIETY OF HEALTH -- ADVERSE

02:46:06.956 --> 02:46:08.458
HEALTH EFFECTS INCLUDING CANCER

02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:10.226
HARM TO DEVELOPING FETUSES

02:46:10.293 --> 02:46:15.865
INFANTS AND CHILDREN -- AND HARM

02:46:15.932 --> 02:46:17.434
TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM -- ALTHOUGH

02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:18.068
WE DON'T HAVE HEALTH INFORMATION

02:46:18.134 --> 02:46:19.269
ALL FORTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:46:19.336 --> 02:46:19.903
CHEMICALS WITHIN THIS CLASS WE

02:46:19.969 --> 02:46:22.272
DO KNOW IS THAT -- MORE COMPLEX

02:46:22.339 --> 02:46:23.707
CHEMICALS WITHIN THIS CLASS

02:46:23.773 --> 02:46:27.977
BREAK DOWN INTO -- OR OR INTO A

02:46:28.044 --> 02:46:29.779
SMALL SUBGROUP OF THESE

02:46:29.846 --> 02:46:31.481
CHEMICALS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:33.316
INFORMATION ON AND IN TERMS OF

02:46:33.383 --> 02:46:35.185
THEIR TOXICITY -- AND THAT'S WHY

02:46:35.251 --> 02:46:36.986
THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF DTS THE

02:46:37.053 --> 02:46:38.321
EXPLAINED IN A STATE HEARING

02:46:38.388 --> 02:46:40.023
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT ALL ROADS

02:46:40.090 --> 02:46:41.691
LEAD TO P. FAA'S WHICH IS THE

02:46:41.758 --> 02:46:42.892
SMALL SUBGROUP.

02:46:42.959 --> 02:46:44.728
OF P. FAST THAT WE NOW ARE

02:46:44.794 --> 02:46:47.397
ASSOCIATED WITH -- ADVERSE

02:46:47.464 --> 02:46:48.331
HEALTH EFFECTS -- AND WHY THE

02:46:48.398 --> 02:46:49.833
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM

02:46:49.899 --> 02:46:51.301
IN CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING AT THE

02:46:51.368 --> 02:46:54.671
ENTIRE CLASS OF THESE CHEMICALS

02:46:54.738 --> 02:46:56.506
IN CARPET -- UNDERSTANDING THE

02:46:56.573 --> 02:46:57.640
EXTENT OF PEANUTS CONTAMINATION

02:46:57.707 --> 02:46:59.175
IN CALIFORNIA DRINKING WATER.

02:46:59.242 --> 02:47:00.810
IS AN AND ENTERING THE IMPORTANT

02:47:00.877 --> 02:47:01.945
STEP IN OUR PROTECT IN

02:47:02.011 --> 02:47:04.114
CALIFORNIANS FROM EXPOSURE TO

02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:05.749
THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS.

02:47:05.815 --> 02:47:07.250
ARE BASED ON NATIONAL MONITORING

02:47:07.317 --> 02:47:09.119
FOUR YEARS AGO -- THEIR

02:47:09.185 --> 02:47:10.387
APPROXIMATE THREE POINT FIVE

02:47:10.453 --> 02:47:12.288
MILLION CALIFORNIANS ABOUT 10%

02:47:12.355 --> 02:47:13.056
OF OUR POPULATION THAT ARE

02:47:13.123 --> 02:47:14.424
DRINKING P. FAST CONTAMINATED

02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:15.592
WATER.

02:47:15.658 --> 02:47:17.527
HOWEVER THIS IS ACTUALLY --

02:47:17.594 --> 02:47:19.929
LIKELY A UNDERESTIMATE -- OF THE

02:47:19.996 --> 02:47:21.931
THE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION OF

02:47:21.998 --> 02:47:23.333
OUR DRINKING WATER THIS IS

02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:25.869
BECAUSE NATIONAL TESTING -- HAS

02:47:25.935 --> 02:47:27.771
SEVERAL LIMITATIONS THEIR

02:47:27.837 --> 02:47:29.172
REPORTING LIMITS WERE VERY HIGH

02:47:29.239 --> 02:47:30.840
HIGHER THAN LEVELS THAT ARE OF

02:47:30.907 --> 02:47:31.741
HEALTH CONCERN.

02:47:31.808 --> 02:47:33.576
ARE THERE WERE ONLY A FEW P.

02:47:33.643 --> 02:47:34.644
FAST TESTED.

02:47:34.711 --> 02:47:36.012
FOR TOM AND IT FOCUSED ON LARGER

02:47:36.079 --> 02:47:39.082
SYSTEMS OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:40.417
START.

02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:41.351
WHICH MEANS THAT THERE COULD BE

02:47:41.418 --> 02:47:42.018
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE I

02:47:42.085 --> 02:47:42.986
CALIFORNIANS DRINKING PEOPLE'S

02:47:43.052 --> 02:47:44.487
CONTAMINATED WATER THAN WE KNOW

02:47:44.554 --> 02:47:47.624
NOW. FOR REFERENCE -- WHEN

02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:49.426
MICHIGAN EXPANDED -- IT'S

02:47:49.492 --> 02:47:50.727
TESTING FOR BEFORE US IN ITS OWN

02:47:50.794 --> 02:47:51.694
WATER.

02:47:51.761 --> 02:47:53.062
THEY FOUND ESTIMATES FOR

02:47:53.129 --> 02:47:54.697
AFFECTED POPULATION WENT FROM

02:47:54.764 --> 02:47:56.166
UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:47:56.232 --> 02:47:57.434
PEOPLE TO OVER ONE POINT FIVE

02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:58.968
MILLION PEOPLE.

02:47:59.035 --> 02:48:00.370
THERE'S A HANDOUT THAT -- WAS

02:48:00.437 --> 02:48:03.206
SENT OUT -- IF THERE'S TIME I

02:48:03.273 --> 02:48:04.340
CAN GO THROUGH A QUICK OR CAN

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:05.742
SKIP YOU HAVE ANOTHER.

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:08.478
MINUTE AND FIFTEEN SECONDS.

02:48:08.545 --> 02:48:09.112
BASICALLY IT SHOWS IN THE AND

02:48:09.179 --> 02:48:11.181
THE THE FIRST MAP SHOWS THE

02:48:11.247 --> 02:48:11.915
RESULTS FROM THE NATIONAL

02:48:11.981 --> 02:48:12.849
TESTING.

02:48:12.916 --> 02:48:14.551
THE SECOND MAP SHOWS FROM WHEN

02:48:14.617 --> 02:48:15.552
CAP A MICHIGAN DID THEIR OWN

02:48:15.618 --> 02:48:16.953
TESTING WHERE THEY TESTED ALL OF

02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:18.354
THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS.

02:48:18.421 --> 02:48:19.088
AND THEY ALSO DID SITE

02:48:19.155 --> 02:48:20.356
INVESTIGATIONS BASED OFF OF

02:48:20.423 --> 02:48:22.559
SITES WHERE -- THEY THOUGHT THEY

02:48:22.625 --> 02:48:24.461
WOULD BE RISK OF CONTAMINATION

02:48:24.527 --> 02:48:26.095
THEY FOUND OVER -- FIVE FORTY

02:48:26.162 --> 02:48:27.697
CONTAMINATION SITES NUMBER

02:48:27.764 --> 02:48:30.800
HUNDRED THEIR PUBLIC WATER

02:48:30.867 --> 02:48:32.435
SYSTEMS WERE AFFECTED -- THIS

02:48:32.502 --> 02:48:33.303
COMPARISON REALLY HIGHLIGHTS HOW

02:48:33.369 --> 02:48:34.337
IMPORTANT COMPREHENSIVE TESTING

02:48:34.404 --> 02:48:36.139
IS FOR UNDERSTANDING -- THE

02:48:36.206 --> 02:48:37.574
CONTAMINATION EXISTS IN OUR

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.175
WATER -- THAT WE AND OUR

02:48:39.242 --> 02:48:41.544
FAMILIES DRINK EVERY DAY -- AND

02:48:41.611 --> 02:48:43.112
TO WRAP UP AS THE THIS BILL

02:48:43.179 --> 02:48:44.447
MOVES FORWARD WE SUPPORT THE

02:48:44.514 --> 02:48:46.816
CONCEPT OF EXPANDED MONITORING

02:48:46.883 --> 02:48:47.450
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT

02:48:47.517 --> 02:48:51.120
THE FOCUSES ON THE ENTIRE CLASS

02:48:51.187 --> 02:48:51.721
NOT JUST ONE CHEMICAL AT THE

02:48:51.788 --> 02:48:54.424
TIME -- THAT THERE IS A ANNUAL

02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:56.326
TESTING OF ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

02:48:56.392 --> 02:48:58.027
WATER SYSTEMS AT TO COMPLEMENT

02:48:58.094 --> 02:48:59.229
THE SITE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE

02:48:59.295 --> 02:49:00.930
GOING ON WITH THAT BY THE STATE

02:49:00.997 --> 02:49:02.432
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD.

02:49:02.499 --> 02:49:03.533
AND THAT THE MOST CURRENT

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:05.869
TESTING METHODS ARE USED.

02:49:05.935 --> 02:49:07.270
TO CAPTURE THE GREATEST NUMBER

02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:09.772
OF PEOPLE US -- AT HEALTH

02:49:09.839 --> 02:49:11.975
RELEVANT LEVELS ON THANK YOU AND

02:49:12.041 --> 02:49:12.942
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

02:49:13.009 --> 02:49:17.213
THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE

02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:17.780
COMMITTEE AS THIS BILL MOVES

02:49:17.847 --> 02:49:19.349
TOWARD.

02:49:19.415 --> 02:49:22.352
ALL RIGHT -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

02:49:22.418 --> 02:49:23.152
NGUYEN COMMISSAIRE CLUB

02:49:23.219 --> 02:49:26.122
CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT.

02:49:26.189 --> 02:49:31.060
ANY IN OPPOSITION.

02:49:31.127 --> 02:49:34.397
ALL RIGHT WELL -- THE NEXT ITEM.

02:49:34.464 --> 02:49:38.501
WILL BE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS

02:49:38.568 --> 02:49:38.801
[inaudible]

02:49:38.868 --> 02:49:40.270
BEAR.

02:49:40.336 --> 02:49:42.005
I WAS GONNA MAKE SIMPLY MEMBER

02:49:42.071 --> 02:49:49.245
BAUER CA HAGEN LEON -- YOU MADE

02:49:49.312 --> 02:49:51.147
A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND

02:49:51.214 --> 02:49:51.447
[inaudible]

02:49:51.514 --> 02:49:53.983
ALL RIGHT.

02:49:54.050 --> 02:49:55.618
ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A

02:49:55.685 --> 02:49:59.222
SECOND -- QUESTIONS.

02:49:59.289 --> 02:50:01.391
SO WERE WERE RAT DEALING WITH

02:50:01.457 --> 02:50:02.725
THE P. FAST [inaudible]

02:50:02.792 --> 02:50:04.360
SO.

02:50:04.427 --> 02:50:06.262
OUR FIRST OF ALL THEIR NUMBER OF

02:50:06.329 --> 02:50:08.164
SORT OF DRAFTING SORTS OF ISSUES

02:50:08.231 --> 02:50:10.266
THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE LIST

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:10.900
AND I KNOW YOU WORK WITH US AND

02:50:10.967 --> 02:50:14.704
THOSE -- AND THIS IS A QUESTION

02:50:14.771 --> 02:50:17.106
FOR THE TECHNICAL EXPERT.

02:50:17.173 --> 02:50:19.809
SO WHAT THE WATER BOARD DO IS

02:50:19.876 --> 02:50:21.611
DOING RIGHT NOW IT'S TESTING FOR

02:50:21.678 --> 02:50:23.713
TO CHEMICALS.

02:50:23.780 --> 02:50:26.716
THERE IS A METHOD. TO TEST FOR

02:50:26.783 --> 02:50:29.419
SIXTEEN OTHERS.

02:50:29.485 --> 02:50:32.021
IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME WHY WHEN

02:50:32.088 --> 02:50:33.389
THERE WAS ACTUALLY WITH THE TIME

02:50:33.456 --> 02:50:35.158
IT WAS DONE IT WAS ONLY TWELVE

02:50:35.224 --> 02:50:36.626
OTHERS BUT THERE'S COMING UP A

02:50:36.693 --> 02:50:37.493
NEW.

02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:38.828
A NEW TEST WHICH SHOULD LAST

02:50:38.895 --> 02:50:39.896
SIXTY NOW THERE'S BUT WE DON'T

02:50:39.963 --> 02:50:41.564
KNOW WHEN THAT'LL BE CERTIFIED

02:50:41.631 --> 02:50:42.098
SO THE POINT IS THERE ARE

02:50:42.165 --> 02:50:45.702
THERE'S NOW [inaudible]

02:50:45.768 --> 02:50:50.139
ON YOU THINK WHY IS IT IMPORTANT

02:50:50.206 --> 02:50:52.008
TO LOOK AT THE CLASS IS A WHOLE

02:50:52.075 --> 02:50:53.776
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A METHOD OF

02:50:53.843 --> 02:50:55.478
DOING THAT.

02:50:55.545 --> 02:50:56.679
SO WHAT WE MEAN BY LOOKING AT

02:50:56.746 --> 02:50:58.681
THE CLASS AS A WHOLE IS TO TAKE

02:50:58.748 --> 02:51:00.316
A CLASS BASED APPROACH SO TO

02:51:00.383 --> 02:51:02.285
THINK ABOUT THE CLASS AS A WHOLE.

02:51:02.352 --> 02:51:05.088
CLASS CONCERN OBVIOUSLY WORKING

02:51:05.154 --> 02:51:07.256
WITH IN THE TECHNICAL

02:51:07.323 --> 02:51:08.591
FEASIBILITY IS THAT WE HAVE NOW

02:51:08.658 --> 02:51:11.094
SO -- ACTUALLY THE WATER BOARD

02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:12.996
IN ITS SITE INVESTIGATION SO

02:51:13.062 --> 02:51:14.397
IT'S DURING A PHASE FRIGHTENED

02:51:14.464 --> 02:51:15.365
OF MASTICATION ONE THAT MEANS IS

02:51:15.431 --> 02:51:16.599
THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT SITES

02:51:16.666 --> 02:51:18.001
WHERE WE THINK WE KNOW THERE'S

02:51:18.067 --> 02:51:19.335
KIND CONTAMINATION.

02:51:19.402 --> 02:51:22.205
BASED OFF OF PREVIOUS USE SO FOR

02:51:22.271 --> 02:51:23.306
INSTANCE NEAR.

02:51:23.373 --> 02:51:25.041
DOT SITES -- AND WHAT THEY'RE

02:51:25.108 --> 02:51:26.275
GOING TO BE DOING IS ACTUALLY

02:51:26.342 --> 02:51:27.710
TESTING.

02:51:27.777 --> 02:51:29.145
FOR THAT THE WHAT WITH THE EPA

02:51:29.212 --> 02:51:30.413
METHOD WHICH WOULD BE FOURTEEN

02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:32.315
P. FASTER NOT JUST LOOKING AT

02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:35.551
THE FILE MP FAST -- FOR PUBLIC

02:51:35.618 --> 02:51:36.619
WATER SYSTEMS THEY HAVE

02:51:36.686 --> 02:51:38.421
NOTIFICATION LEVELS ARE IN TERM

02:51:38.488 --> 02:51:39.822
NOTIFICATION LEVELS FOR JUST

02:51:39.889 --> 02:51:41.924
THOSE TWO AND THAT'S BECAUSE

02:51:41.991 --> 02:51:44.293
THEY WERE ASKED -- TO THAT

02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:45.361
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP THAT THEY

02:51:45.428 --> 02:51:46.596
COULD TAKE RATES OF THE WATER

02:51:46.663 --> 02:51:49.232
BOARD ASK THEM WHAT WOULD BE ARE.

02:51:49.298 --> 02:51:51.067
ASKED WE HOW WHAT WOULD BE IN

02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:53.069
TERM LEVELS FOR THESE TWO BASED

02:51:53.136 --> 02:51:54.537
OFF OF WHAT THE OTHER

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:56.673
INFORMATION OUT THERE AND THEY

02:51:56.739 --> 02:51:57.807
BASED IT OFF NEW JERSEY'S.

02:51:57.874 --> 02:51:59.409
RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT THAT

02:51:59.475 --> 02:52:01.110
THEY'VE ALREADY DONE -- WE HAS

02:52:01.177 --> 02:52:03.546
NOW DOING ITS OWN ASSESSMENT OF

02:52:03.613 --> 02:52:05.648
THOSE TWO CHEMICALS BUT THE

02:52:05.715 --> 02:52:07.950
WATER BOARD -- CAN ASK THEM TO

02:52:08.017 --> 02:52:10.787
DO THAT AT SET IN TERM LEVELS --

02:52:10.853 --> 02:52:12.321
A NOTIFICATION NOVELS FOR THE

02:52:12.388 --> 02:52:13.690
OTHERS AS WELL SO BUT THE

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:16.192
QUESTION IS -- WHAT IS THE

02:52:16.259 --> 02:52:24.767
ADVANTAGE OF REQUIRING THE --

02:52:24.834 --> 02:52:25.435
WATER UTILITIES TO TO ALSO TEST

02:52:25.501 --> 02:52:27.103
FOR THE OTHER CHEMICALS CAN BE

02:52:27.170 --> 02:52:28.571
DETECTED RAINY OTHER.

02:52:28.638 --> 02:52:29.272
TWELVE THE SITE INVESTIGATIONS --

02:52:29.338 --> 02:52:30.573
WILL LOOK AT WHAT WE THINK WILL

02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:32.041
BE USED AREAS OF CONTAMINATION

02:52:32.108 --> 02:52:33.476
BUT FROM LOOKING OUR MICHIGAN

02:52:33.543 --> 02:52:35.078
DID -- BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE THE

02:52:35.144 --> 02:52:36.279
MOST COMPREHENSIVE TESTING IN

02:52:36.345 --> 02:52:38.648
THE NATION -- WHAT THEY FOUND

02:52:38.715 --> 02:52:40.383
WAS THERE THE TWO DON'T ALWAYS

02:52:40.450 --> 02:52:42.452
MATCH UP SO BASED OFF OF

02:52:42.518 --> 02:52:43.619
HISTORICAL INFORMATION THEY WENT

02:52:43.686 --> 02:52:44.987
INSIDE INVESTIGATION FROM THE

02:52:45.054 --> 02:52:46.055
FOUND OVER FORTY PLUS

02:52:46.122 --> 02:52:48.157
CONTAMINATION SITES WITHIN STATE?

02:52:48.224 --> 02:52:50.359
WHEREVER THERE ARE SOME -- AND

02:52:50.426 --> 02:52:51.527
THEN BUT THEY ALSO SURVEYS ALL

02:52:51.594 --> 02:52:53.196
OF THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND

02:52:53.262 --> 02:52:54.363
WHAT YOU SEE IS THERE ARE SOME

02:52:54.430 --> 02:52:58.067
PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT DON'T

02:52:58.134 --> 02:52:59.902
HAVE CONTAMINATION -- BUT THERE

02:52:59.969 --> 02:53:01.170
ARE SITES WITHIN THAT AREA THAT

02:53:01.237 --> 02:53:02.705
ARE CONTAMINATED NOTS PROBABLY

02:53:02.772 --> 02:53:04.440
BECAUSE THAT PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM

02:53:04.507 --> 02:53:05.842
HAS A SOURCE THAT ISN'T

02:53:05.908 --> 02:53:07.577
NECESSARILY AFFECTED BY A YET

02:53:07.643 --> 02:53:10.279
BUT THAT AREAS SERVED BY -- WELL

02:53:10.346 --> 02:53:12.281
WATER.

02:53:12.348 --> 02:53:15.017
AND THEN VICE VERSA -- THERE ARE

02:53:15.084 --> 02:53:17.053
WORDS PUBLIC WATER CONTAMINATION

02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:18.254
UP PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM

02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:19.722
CONTAMINATION THAT WASN'T

02:53:19.789 --> 02:53:21.924
PROTECTED BY AT A SITE SO FOR

02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:23.726
INSTANCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP

02:53:23.793 --> 02:53:26.162
YEAH BUT THE QUESTION IS.

02:53:26.229 --> 02:53:27.597
I THAT'S ALL FINE BUT YOU'RE NOT

02:53:27.663 --> 02:53:29.599
ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHY.

02:53:29.665 --> 02:53:31.567
WE WOULD ASK THE PUBLIC WATER

02:53:31.634 --> 02:53:35.104
COMPANIES. TO TEST.

02:53:35.171 --> 02:53:36.305
FOR FOURTEEN RATHER THAN TO AND

02:53:36.372 --> 02:53:39.342
REPORT ON TO RATHER THAN

02:53:39.408 --> 02:53:39.876
FOURTEEN RIGHT WHAT IS THE

02:53:39.942 --> 02:53:41.778
ADVANTAGE OF GOING IT WILL THIS

02:53:41.844 --> 02:53:43.813
SHOW SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT IS

02:53:43.880 --> 02:53:45.314
REALLY THE QUESTION.

02:53:45.381 --> 02:53:46.949
RIGHT SO WHAT WE SEE AS BAD AND

02:53:47.016 --> 02:53:49.318
PEOPLE'S BLOOD THERE ARE THAT

02:53:49.385 --> 02:53:51.788
WE'VE SEEN -- AT LEAST FOUR

02:53:51.854 --> 02:53:53.656
DIFFERENT BE FAST THAT ARE

02:53:53.723 --> 02:53:55.324
COMMON THROUGHOUT -- PEOPLE'S

02:53:55.391 --> 02:53:56.993
BLOOD IN IN NATIONALLY SO THAT

02:53:57.059 --> 02:53:57.794
MEANS WERE BEING EXPLORED

02:53:57.860 --> 02:54:00.797
EXPOSED TO MORE THAN JUST THOSE --

02:54:00.863 --> 02:54:02.165
TWO ALSO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT A

02:54:02.231 --> 02:54:04.734
LOT OF THESE CHEMICALS AYE OCCUR --

02:54:04.801 --> 02:54:06.335
TOGETHER AND WATER THEY DON'T

02:54:06.402 --> 02:54:07.336
IT'S NOT THAT IT'S RARE THAT

02:54:07.403 --> 02:54:08.638
THERE'S ONLY P. PHí

02:54:08.704 --> 02:54:09.739
FOSS AND WATER.

02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:13.075
AND ALSO -- THE CDC HAS -- COME

02:54:13.142 --> 02:54:14.443
UP WITH NUMBERS FOR MORE THAN

02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:15.478
JUST BE PHONE BEFORE US IN TERMS

02:54:15.545 --> 02:54:18.114
OF HOW OKAY SO I STILL HAVEN'T

02:54:18.181 --> 02:54:19.682
HEARD FOR A REASON AND I WHY WE

02:54:19.749 --> 02:54:21.083
NEED TO TEST.

02:54:21.150 --> 02:54:22.785
AND GET REPORTS ON THE OTHER

02:54:22.852 --> 02:54:24.754
DOESN'T I I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD

02:54:24.821 --> 02:54:28.958
THAT FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:54:29.025 --> 02:54:29.959
SAYING THAT.

02:54:30.026 --> 02:54:31.527
THE THING IS HER.

02:54:31.594 --> 02:54:32.762
IN ARE THE SAME.

02:54:32.829 --> 02:54:34.864
THE SAME THINGS OCCUR.

02:54:34.931 --> 02:54:37.133
THAT P. FOSS BE FAST.

02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:38.868
THESE OTHER CHEMICALS ARE LIKELY

02:54:38.935 --> 02:54:40.269
TO BE THERE TOO SO WHY DO WE

02:54:40.336 --> 02:54:43.339
NEED TO TEST THE OTHER.

02:54:43.406 --> 02:54:44.473
FOURTEEN THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:45.308
QUESTION I'M TRYING TO GET AN

02:54:45.374 --> 02:54:46.909
ANSWER TO BECAUSE THE RATIOS ARE

02:54:46.976 --> 02:54:48.611
ALWAYS THE SAME SO THE LEVELS OF

02:54:48.678 --> 02:54:50.213
CONTAMINATION BETWEEN SO THERE

02:54:50.279 --> 02:54:51.814
ARE SITES WHERE THERE WILL BE

02:54:51.881 --> 02:54:53.149
MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SHORT CHAINS

02:54:53.216 --> 02:54:54.016
THEN LONG CHAINS THAT WILL

02:54:54.083 --> 02:54:55.852
CHANGE THE TYPE OF TREATMENT

02:54:55.918 --> 02:54:56.953
THAT NEEDS. TO BE USED.

02:54:57.019 --> 02:54:58.454
ALSO IT GIVES US A BETTER IDEA

02:54:58.521 --> 02:54:59.655
OF THE TYPE OF CONTAMINATION

02:54:59.722 --> 02:55:00.890
THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH AND WHAT

02:55:00.957 --> 02:55:02.058
CHEMICALS WOULD NECESSARILY BE

02:55:02.124 --> 02:55:03.593
MORE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS BASED

02:55:03.659 --> 02:55:04.594
OFF OF THE EXPOSURES THAT WAY

02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:06.028
OKAY AND YOU WOULD GET THIS BY

02:55:06.095 --> 02:55:07.930
LOOKING AT THESE OTHER TWELVE

02:55:07.997 --> 02:55:09.131
CHEMICALS.

02:55:09.198 --> 02:55:09.332
OKAY.

02:55:09.398 --> 02:55:11.934
THANK YOU.

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:14.070
MR MATHIS THANK YOU ITS

02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:15.771
DISSOLUTION THE DISCUSSION WHEN

02:55:15.838 --> 02:55:17.540
IT MAKES SENSE TO TEST THE TO

02:55:17.607 --> 02:55:19.842
WIN AND IF IT DOES COME UP THEN

02:55:19.909 --> 02:55:22.411
DO FURTHER TESTING.

02:55:22.478 --> 02:55:24.113
VERSUS SPENDING THE MONEY.

02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:25.381
IN ENFORCING THE LOCALS A SPEND

02:55:25.448 --> 02:55:26.883
THE MONEY TO TO TEST.

02:55:26.949 --> 02:55:28.818
SEVERAL WHEN WE KNOW OKAY IF WE

02:55:28.885 --> 02:55:30.720
JUST USED TO IS AS YOU SAID IN

02:55:30.786 --> 02:55:31.520
YOUR STATEMENT.

02:55:31.587 --> 02:55:34.390
THAT OFTEN THE OTHERS ARE THERE

02:55:34.457 --> 02:55:36.626
STILL.

02:55:36.692 --> 02:55:40.162
LIKE I SAID BEFORE -- THERE ARE.

02:55:40.229 --> 02:55:41.364
ALL CONTAMINATION SITUATIONS ARE

02:55:41.430 --> 02:55:43.366
NOT THE SAME SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:55:43.432 --> 02:55:44.767
IT INTO THE DETAILED DATA ON IN

02:55:44.834 --> 02:55:46.669
MICHIGAN THERE ARE SOME SITES

02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:49.405
WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT OF OTHER

02:55:49.472 --> 02:55:50.940
TYPES OF THE FAUCET NOT P. FILL

02:55:51.007 --> 02:55:52.008
MP FOSTER'S.

02:55:52.074 --> 02:55:53.276
TO AND THEN THERE'S OTHER SITES

02:55:53.342 --> 02:55:54.577
WORK FOR DOMINATED BY PEOPLE ON%

02:55:54.644 --> 02:55:56.312
THE FAUCET NOT THE OTHERS AND

02:55:56.379 --> 02:55:57.747
THE REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT IS

02:55:57.813 --> 02:55:58.648
BECAUSE THE TREATMENT IS

02:55:58.714 --> 02:56:00.483
DIFFERENT. FOR THE DIFFERENT

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:02.585
TYPES OF P. FIVE NINE WE'VE DONE

02:56:02.652 --> 02:56:06.889
WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE THE

02:56:06.956 --> 02:56:08.291
TREATMENTS ARE DIFFERENT IT'S

02:56:08.357 --> 02:56:10.693
GONNA HAVE CONTAMINATION AND

02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:11.294
WE'RE TESTING FOR TWO TYPES.

02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:12.428
THAT WE KNOW OKAY NOW IT'S

02:56:12.495 --> 02:56:13.429
CONTAMINATED WE HAVE TESTS TO

02:56:13.496 --> 02:56:14.897
SEE WHAT ELSE IS IN THERE.

02:56:14.964 --> 02:56:16.065
IN A ONE TRIGGERS THE OTHER.

02:56:16.132 --> 02:56:17.366
BUT YOU YOU'RE SAYING TO GO

02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:18.567
AHEAD AND JUST.

02:56:18.634 --> 02:56:20.436
THERE WOULD LIKELY THERE WOULD

02:56:20.503 --> 02:56:21.037
BE SITES WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:22.271
YOU BETTER SPEAK INTO THE

02:56:22.338 --> 02:56:23.706
MICROPHONE BECAUSE WE'RE

02:56:23.773 --> 02:56:26.075
RECORDING THIS AND I KNOW.

02:56:26.142 --> 02:56:29.178
YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE PERSON

02:56:29.245 --> 02:56:29.712
IS AND I HAVE A QUESTION.

02:56:29.779 --> 02:56:31.914
HE CAN HEAR YOU AND THE AUDIENCE

02:56:31.981 --> 02:56:34.150
AND THE PEOPLE WHO IN THE

02:56:34.216 --> 02:56:35.751
AUDIENCE AND THE GROUP THAT'S

02:56:35.818 --> 02:56:37.219
LISTENING TO THE BROADCAST

02:56:37.286 --> 02:56:38.788
CANCER JUST TALK INTO THE

02:56:38.854 --> 02:56:39.956
MICROPHONE.

02:56:40.022 --> 02:56:41.023
RIGHT SO THERE ARE WITH THEIR

02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:42.158
WILL THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE

02:56:42.224 --> 02:56:43.993
WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE ARE OTHER

02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:44.660
TYPES OF P..

02:56:44.727 --> 02:56:46.896
COSTS WITHIN THE FOURTEEN ARMED

02:56:46.963 --> 02:56:48.631
THAT HAVE SHOWN UP BUT NOT WOULD

02:56:48.698 --> 02:56:55.004
NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY -- HE FELL

02:56:55.071 --> 02:56:56.739
AND THE FAST THE TO OKAY

02:56:56.806 --> 02:56:57.039
[inaudible]

02:56:57.106 --> 02:56:59.041
ALL RIGHT.

02:56:59.108 --> 02:57:00.943
WHAT WAS THAT AND SHE SAID WHAT

02:57:01.010 --> 02:57:03.946
I WAS GONNA SAY [inaudible]

02:57:04.013 --> 02:57:06.482
OKAY -- ALL RIGHT.

02:57:06.549 --> 02:57:09.251
OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:57:09.318 --> 02:57:12.021
MADAM VICE CHAIR DO WANNA

02:57:12.088 --> 02:57:13.322
ANYTHING -- WHITE.

02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:13.923
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M

02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:14.824
JUST I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH

02:57:14.890 --> 02:57:16.292
THE FACT THAT THERE IS -- A

02:57:16.359 --> 02:57:17.660
CUSTOMER WARNING IF YOU WILL

02:57:17.727 --> 02:57:18.427
IT'S REQUIRED UNDER THIS BILL

02:57:18.494 --> 02:57:21.197
EVEN THOUGH THE LEVEL MAY NOT.

02:57:21.263 --> 02:57:22.965
RISE TO THE LEVEL OF IN A

02:57:23.032 --> 02:57:25.968
WARNING. FOR FOR HEALTH REASONS

02:57:26.035 --> 02:57:27.937
AND I'M JUST

02:57:28.004 --> 02:57:28.704
TRYING TO IT.

02:57:28.771 --> 02:57:30.239
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT YOU

02:57:30.306 --> 02:57:31.807
KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE BECAUSE

02:57:31.874 --> 02:57:33.476
SOME PARENTS TO PANIC.

02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:34.677
OUT THERE THANK YOU AS SO IT'S

02:57:34.744 --> 02:57:36.379
ONLY IF IT TRIGGERS THE

02:57:36.445 --> 02:57:38.314
NOTIFICATION LEVEL SO WE HAVE IN

02:57:38.381 --> 02:57:40.049
OUR NO THEY GET NOTIFICATION A

02:57:40.116 --> 02:57:40.816
LIST RIGHT NOW UNTIL WE HIT

02:57:40.883 --> 02:57:41.650
THOSE LEVELS.

02:57:41.717 --> 02:57:42.885
THAT'S WHEN WE DO BE DISCLOSED

02:57:42.952 --> 02:57:44.720
IN THE SAME WE HAVE OTHER

02:57:44.787 --> 02:57:46.222
CHEMICALS THAT ONCE A YEAR YOU

02:57:46.288 --> 02:57:47.656
GET IN YOUR BILL AT DISCLOSURE

02:57:47.723 --> 02:57:49.158
OF WHAT WAS TRIGGERED TO WHAT

02:57:49.225 --> 02:57:50.459
EXCEEDED A CERTAIN LEVEL IF WE

02:57:50.526 --> 02:57:51.260
ARE GETTING.

02:57:51.327 --> 02:57:52.395
SO THAT'S WILL BE TRIGGERED IN

02:57:52.461 --> 02:57:53.996
THIS CASE TO SAID THE ENRON

02:57:54.063 --> 02:57:55.297
LEVEL WOULD HAVE TO BE TRIGGERED

02:57:55.364 --> 02:57:59.969
FOR YOU TO GET THE NOTIFICATION.

02:58:00.036 --> 02:58:01.871
OKAY THANK YOU.

02:58:01.937 --> 02:58:03.139
ALL RIGHT UP IF THERE KNOW WHAT

02:58:03.205 --> 02:58:04.507
THE QUESTIONS ARE I'D LIKE TO

02:58:04.573 --> 02:58:05.975
ASK YOU TO CLOSE YES -- I WANT

02:58:06.042 --> 02:58:07.343
TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR

02:58:07.410 --> 02:58:08.744
WORKING WITH AS OF THE CHAIR AND

02:58:08.811 --> 02:58:10.046
I HAVE A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE

02:58:10.112 --> 02:58:11.881
TO WORK ON THIS CLOSELY AND MAKE

02:58:11.947 --> 02:58:13.049
SURE THAT HIS CONCERNS ARE

02:58:13.115 --> 02:58:13.616
ADDRESSED BEFORE WE GO ANY

02:58:13.682 --> 02:58:17.053
FURTHER -- AND I APOLOGIZE FOR

02:58:17.119 --> 02:58:19.055
MY LACK OF ENTHUSIASM BUT THIS

02:58:19.121 --> 02:58:20.790
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL -- I

02:58:20.856 --> 02:58:22.224
STARTED TO LOOK AT EXCITED WHICH

02:58:22.291 --> 02:58:24.593
LED TO AN ARTICLE ABOUT PLANT

02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:26.195
WHICH LED TO AN ARTICLE ABOUT
