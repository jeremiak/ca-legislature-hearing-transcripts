OPPOSITE WHERE WE'RE GRANTING

THESE ASSESSMENT APPEALS

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:34.225

INCLUDED BECAUSE I THINK- YOU

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.910
KNOW I THINK IT'S KIND OF A-

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:54.278
RATHER THAN BEING FLEXIBLE WITH

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:55.379
WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS IT'S

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:57.882

RECESSION TO THE PREVIOUS

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:22.506
RECESSION WHICH IS AROUND TWO

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:23.607

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:37.888
HIGHER THAN THE NORMAL. IN

MOSTLY. THAT COMPLEX PROPERTY

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:47.031

COUNTIES WERE PREPARED AND

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:09.286
GIVEN THAT THIS RECESSION

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:13.090

DIFFERENT COUNTIES- I BELIEVE

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.331

SIGNIFICANT OUT OF DATA- IT'S

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:52.863

TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR IT'S

00:51:43.567 --> 00:51:44.701
VERY LIKELY THAT WOULD HAVE TO

ELEAZAR DURING THE NINETEEN.

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:13.430

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.365
THE ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGES

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:17.267

ISSUE IN THE JUNE BUDGET AND I

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:38.728
COMMUNITY THAT'S GOT A BIG

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:39.496
DEVELOPMENT FROM BURY PEOPLE

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:41.564
COMING OVER AND- THEY'RE

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:42.766
ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE POPULATION

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:43.900
OR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS GOING

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:45.969
FROM LIKE THREE THOUSAND TO

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:46.936
SOME LIKE SIX THOUSAND MEALS

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:48.838
NUMBERS ARE CORRECT. IN THE

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:51.608
NEXT YEAR AND WHEN 95% OF

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.143
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASKED US YOU

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:54.277
KNOW COBIT NINETEEN IS

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:56.679
HAPPENING THE SKY IS FALLING.

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:59.315
JUST HOLD HARMLESS CAPPER EDA

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:00.784
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE TODAY

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:01.818
INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF CHARTER

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:02.952
SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.988
SAME ISSUE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:06.156
SCHOOL THEY'RE STAYING HOME

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:08.324
SOMEONE A CAP. EIGHTY EIGHT SO

00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:09.793
WE MADE THE TOUGH CHOICES FARMS

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:11.461
OKAY WE'RE GONNA CAP WE'RE

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:12.362
WE'RE WE'RE GONNA FREEZE IT

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:13.663
FREEZE YOUR FUNDING IT TO DRAW

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:14.898
A LINE IN THE SAND SO YOU HAVE

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:16.666
TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE. IT

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:20.904
WASN'T TO HAVE SOME PLOY TO

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:21.604
HARM THESE OTHER ENTITIES

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:22.705
THAT'S WHERE WE WORK WHERE WE

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:28.077
WORK LAST MARCH APRIL AND MAY.

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:28.711
WE ADOPTED THE BUDGET IN JUNE.

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:29.312
AND WE KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:30.713
SCHOOLS ARE FRANKLY DISTANCE

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.848
LEARNING INCLUDING THESE THESE

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:34.617
THESE CHARTERS BUT- 95% OF

00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:37.353
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHAT ARE AND

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.322
ARE IN DEEP DEEP TROUBLE AND-

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:41.791
WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND I THINK

00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:43.293
WE FIX THE BIGGEST ISSUE HERE

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:44.561
WITH THIS WITH THIS PLAN

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:47.463
GROWTH- AND SO I THINK THAT

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.365
IT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE. IT

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:51.935
HOLDS- THAT THE DISTRICTS-

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.703
HARMLESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.205
THAT ARE IN GREAT FINANCIAL

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:57.841
PERIL. AS NOTED BY THE

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.843
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SOME OF

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:01.911
THESE- ENTITIES THAT ARE ASKING

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:03.713
FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS. THERE IS

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.315
A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO THEY

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:07.283
RECEIVE THESE MAJOR PPO AWARDS

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.018
THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:10.620
AVAILABLE TO GET TO SO THAT'S-

00:58:10.687 --> 00:58:12.155
NOT INTO CONSIDERATION HERE SO

00:58:12.222 --> 00:58:13.623
I DON'T THINK IT'S- NECESSARILY

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.092
A PUNITIVE. PEACE GOING AFTER

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:19.062
ONE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY FOCUSED

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:22.098
ON- YOU KNOW THAT THE LARGER.

00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:23.499
PICTURE AS FAR AS HOLDING OUR

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:25.802
OUR SCHOOLS. AND IN A VIABLE

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.470
PLACE TO GET THROUGH THIS

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:29.472
PANDEMIC- WITH THAT I THINK

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:31.441
THAT IT WAS A FAIR COMPROMISE.

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:32.709
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:35.945
OUTLINED IT. AS WELL- I JUST I

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.814
DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE UC

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:40.116
THING- I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.252
NOT A THREE PARTY AGREEMENT AND

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:43.386
SO CERTAINLY THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:44.921
HAS THE RIGHT TO BLUE PENCIL

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:47.957
THIS AT THE END- BUT IT I GUESS

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:49.893
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. IS

00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:52.896
THIS JUST A- FURTHERANCE OF OUR

00:58:52.962 --> 00:58:56.499
OF OUR PRIOR ACTIONS AS FAR AS-

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:58.501
CONTRACTING OUT THE NEAREST TO

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.436
CALIFORNIA OR JUST A NEW. IS

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:06.609
THERE ISTHIS A NEW- KIND OF

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:11.481
OBLIGATION ON TOP OF THAT. OKAY

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:12.982
SO THE PROCESS THE WOULD BE

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:15.485
ESTABLISHED- IN THE TRAILER

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:18.054
BILL IT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND-

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:20.523
WHAT IS CURRENT LAW AND THE

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.691
CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:26.229
AGREEMENT- BETWEEN- YOU SEE AND

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:31.267
THEIR PARTNERS. YEAH. GOTCHA SO

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:33.736
THIS PROBABLY QUIT WENT TO WHAT

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:36.706
WAS IN HAD IT BEEN- HAD BEEN

00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:38.074
SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATURE PUT ON

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:40.009
THE BALLOT WAS THE CA FOURTEEN

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:43.079
THAT RIGHT. I THINK THEY'RE

00:59:43.146 --> 00:59:44.514
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- THE

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.516
LANGUAGE CERTAINLY AN ACA

00:59:46.582 --> 00:59:47.617
FOURTEEN VERSES THAT THE

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:49.519
LANGUAGE IN SB EIGHT TWENTY ARE

00:59:49.585 --> 00:59:55.692
VERY DIFFERENT. OKAY. AND THEN

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:58.227
LASTLY I'M SORRY I DID HAVE A

00:59:58.294 --> 00:59:58.828
NOTE HERE WANT TO GO BACK TO

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.396
THE K. TWELVE CAN YOU CAN YOU

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.864
ANSWER THE QUESTION BECAUSE

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:03.366
SOME OF THESE I KNOW WE HAD

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.635
THIS FIFTEEN OF FIVE AND THE

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:08.271
BOOK OF THE LAW ON THE GROWTH

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:09.238
FROM NON CLASSROOM BASED

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:11.407
CHARTERS BUT IF THERE ARE

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:13.943
EXISTING- NON CLASSROOM BASED

GOING TO TAKE AS A RESULT OF

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.979
THE CROSSFIRE CHRIS CRISIS AND

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.414
THEIR BILLS PENDING IN BOTH

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.014
CHAMBERS BUT THE BILL THAT'S

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.482
PENDING IN THE SENATE

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:28.851
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES STATES

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.387
NOT TO PENALIZE CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:32.522
IN RESPECT TO TRADITIONAL

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.757

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.426
THAT FEDERAL AID SO DO DO YOU

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:37.994
WORRY THAT SHOULD THIS BUDGET

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:40.163
TRAILER BILL PASSED THEN-

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:42.498
CALIFORNIA WILL YOU WILL LOSE

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:43.032

BECOMES LAW. THANK YOU I CAN'T

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.372
REALLY COMMENT ON- PENDING

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:51.607
LEGISLATION HOWEVER- I WOULD

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.676
NOTE THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING-

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.111
WHAT. IS HAPPENING AT THE

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:57.513
FEDERAL LEVEL VERY CLOSELY- FOR

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.482
NUMBER OBVIOUSLY OF REASONS-

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.951
AND AT THIS POINT WE FEEL VERY

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:02.518
COMFORTABLE IN THE POSITION

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:04.987
THAT RAT. WELL I DON'T. AND I

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.090
THINK A NUMBER OF US DON'T. AND

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:09.325
THE REASON IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.794
LONG TRADITION IN THE STATE OF.

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:12.795
ALLOWING FUNDING TO FOLLOW THE

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:14.797
STUDENT. AND WE HAVE A LARGE

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:16.399
NUMBER OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.067
ARE CHOOSING NON CLASSROOM

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.002
BASED CHARTERS TO WHETHER THIS

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:22.672
CRISIS- I FULLY SUPPORT THE

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:26.576
DECISION. TO COMPENSATE OUR

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:27.710
TRADITIONAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.679
FOR LOSS OF ENROLLMENT THAT'S-

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:31.114
THAT'S- OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.015
THE- THE EPIDEMIC I THINK THAT

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.150
MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND WE DID

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.319
TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE SCHOOL

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:38.020
DISTRICTS ARE READY WILLING AND

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:40.223
ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:40.756
WHEN THEY COME BACK INTO

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.692
TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS- SETTINGS

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:44.460
BUT- BUT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.362
SENSE TO ME. TO REFUSE TO

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:49.532
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR- THE

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.766
SETTINGS THAT THESE PARENTS ARE

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:51.634
CHOOSING TO SEND THEIR THEIR

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.402
STUDENTS INTO SO I RE I'M

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.104
REALLY HOPING THAT. SURE THIS

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.106
MOVE FOR THAT- WE RECONSIDER

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:58.341
THAT PORTION OF IT AND- NOT THE

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.575
LEAST OF WHICH IS BECAUSE I

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:00.943
THINK IT PUTS A SERIOUSLY IN

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:03.980
DANGER. OF LOSING OUT ON THOSE

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.648
FEDERALLY DOLLARS. I'M JUST

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.717
TALKING ABOUT THE UC ISSUE I'M

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:09.485
IN A KIND OF STRUGGLING TO

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:11.654
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS. WHY

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:12.388
THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE TALKING

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.990
ABOUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT A

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:15.158
QUESTION FOR THE L. A. JUST TO

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:17.994
MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. SO IF

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:18.828
WE IF WE HAVE TO GIVE YOU A

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.096
REAL WORLD EXAMPLE FROM MY

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:22.031
LOCAL YOU SEE. IF WE'VE GOT

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:23.399
SOME BUILDINGS. WITH ELEVATORS

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:26.569
AND THEM. AND THOSE ELEVATORS

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.037
NEED TO BE PERIODICALLY

01:03:28.104 --> 01:03:30.072
MAINTAINED DOES THAT MEAN THAT.

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:33.709
THE SCHOOL HAS TO EMPLOY. A FOR

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:36.312
A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE JUST TO DO

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:38.214
A LOT FOR ELEVATOR MAINTENANCE.

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:40.149
THE END AND THEY GET THEY'RE

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:40.716
NOT ALLOWED TO CONTRACT OUT

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.385
THAT- THAT LABOR. EVEN THOUGH

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.153
THERE'S ENOUGH FULL TIME WORK

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.589
FOR- FOR AN ELEVATOR

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.991
MAINTENANCE REPAIRMAN IS THAT

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.960
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT RIGHT.

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:52.795
THIS IS JENNIFER. WITH THE

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.797
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.098
AND WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.000
ANALYZE THE BILL BUT OUR

01:03:58.067 --> 01:03:59.835
UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS- I CAN

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:19.021
SERVICE AS FINANCE MENTIONED

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.757

RECESSION IN A PANDEMIC WE

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.368
WOULD CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.503
THAT IS INCREASING COSTS FOR.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.738
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:09.972

DOLLARS THAT WE GIVE THEM AND

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:19.248
IF THEY CONTRACT OUT MADE IT'S

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:19.882
ONLY BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:27.056
WORK CORPORATE PART OF THE LAW

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:28.858
REQUIRES THEM TO DO IN FACT.

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:30.326
THERE'S A CURRENT POLICY THAT

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:05.855
RANGES FROM ABOUT THREE AND A

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:08.557
HALF HOURS- FOR THE YOUNGEST

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:11.093
CHILDREN- TO MORE THAN. I HAVE.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.194
I THINK IT'S FOUR AND A HALF

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:14.397
HOURS FOR THE OLDER CHILDREN- I

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:15.364
I'LL GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ON

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.599
THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN BE A

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:18.267
LITTLE BIT OFF ON ON THIS-

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:20.736
HOWEVER AND S. B. AT EIGHT

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.805
TWENTY. DOES PROVIDE IT DOES

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:23.939
INCLUDE SOME LANGUAGE THAT IS

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:26.342
SPECIFIC TO SCHOOL. A FEW

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:28.277
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO- HAD

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.146
PREVIOUSLY BEEN APPROVED FOR

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.415
FOUR DAY SCHOOL WEEKS- AND SO

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:33.482
THE LANGUAGE IN SB TWENTY

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.651
THAT'S REGARDING- AT THOSE

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.787
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AS SPECIFIES

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:41.424
FEWER REQUIRED DAYS- BECAUSE OF

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:46.328
THEIR PREVIOUS AT THAT APPROVAL

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.464
FOR A FOUR DAY SCHOOL. SO OKAY

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:49.632
IN ADDITION SO YOU'RE SAYING

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:51.901
THAT. THAT THE MINIMUM NUMBER

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:55.070
OF- BASICALLY FOUR AND A HALF

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:57.673
HOURS A DAY IS WHAT WE CONSIDER

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.308
THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE'RE

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.010
GOING FOR FIRST FOR ALL THE-

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:03.145
FOR A FULL SCHOOL DAY IS FOUR

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:03.746
AND A HALF HOURS IS THAT WHAT

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.114
YOU'RE SAYING. YEAH IT IT

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:08.150
RANGES DEPENDING ON- THE GREAT

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:09.418
AND AGAIN I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.353
TO YOUR OFFICE ON THAT EXACT

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.588
NUMBER FOR LIKE HIGH SCHOOL

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.723
IT'S HIGHER FOR HIGH SCHOOL-

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:17.293
BUT IT'S- IT RANGES FROM LIKE I

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.127
SAID ABOUT THREE AND A HALF

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:21.964
HOURS FOR- KINDERGARTEN- UP. AS

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:23.332
YOU GO THROUGH THE GREAT AND

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.334
WE'RE JESTING THAT YOU SAYING

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.770
THAT'S CHANGING. NO THAT'S THAT

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:28.938
IS BEING MAINTAINED IT'S THE

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.306
TOTAL NUMBER OF MINUTES

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.874
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.642
THAT WE'VE PROVIDED FLEXIBILITY

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:34.944
BUT THAT THE REQUIREMENT ON

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.179
MINIMUM DAYS. I'VE BEEN ON DALY

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:38.714
MINUTES IS THE SAME AS IT WAS

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.583
CREE COVE IT AS WELL AS THE

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:41.884
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR NUMBER

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.420
OF DAYSIN A YEAR. AND SO THE

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:47.523
ADJUSTMENT WOULD OCCUR BECAUSE

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.090
THE SCHOOLS DECIDED TO FOUR

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:48.691
DAYS INSTEAD OF FIVE IS THAT

01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:50.559
CORRECT. YES THE LANGUAGE IN

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:51.994
SPM EIGHT TWENTY IS VERY

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:53.896
SPECIFIC TYPE OF I BELIEVE IT'S

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:55.865
THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AT WHO

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:57.633
HAD. WHO HAD PRIOR TO CO THAT

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.335
ALREADY BEEN APPROVED FOR FOUR

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:01.103
DAY SCHOOL WEEKS BECAUSE THEY

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.772
ARE AN EXTREMELY RURAL- AND SO

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.140
THIS THAT THE BILL JUST

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.909
SPECIFIES THAT BECAUSE THEY

01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:10.045
WERE NOT. L. ARE NOT REQUIRED

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.413
TO HAVE A MINIMUM A NUMBER OF

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.815
SCHOOL DAYS THAT SIMILAR TO

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.283
OTHER SCHOOLS PARTICLE BUT THAT

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.018
THAT CONTINUES DURING CODE.

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:17.520
OKAY AND SO IT DOESN'T AFFECT

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:18.888
THE OTHER SCHOOLDISTRICTS SO

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:21.156
AT ALL NO IT DOES NOT IT DOES

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:23.759
NOT GOOD TO KNOW- I TO- HAVE

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.628
CONCERNS OF THE FACT THAT WE

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.463
HAVE SEPARATED OUT. OUR PUBLIC

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:28.731
SCHOOLS BECAUSE I CONSIDER

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:29.965
CHARTER SCHOOLS PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.367
AND THEY ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:32.234
WITH THE FUNDED BY PUBLIC

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.403
DOLLARS. SO BUT WE SEPARATED

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.038
THEM OUT THE TYPICALLY THOSE

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:39.108
THAT ARE- OF WHO DO A DISTANCE

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:40.976
LEARNING- WHO DON'T HAVE

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:42.778
PHYSICAL CLASSROOMS- A NON

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.046
BASED CLASSROOM CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.881
WE'VE SEPARATED THEM OUT. AND I

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:46.916
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:47.983
THOSE IN THE STATE BUT IT'S

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.418
QUITE A FEW. I KNOW I HAVE

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:50.619
ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE IN MY

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:53.956
DISTRICT- THAT WILL PROBABLY-

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.358
YOU KNOW FIND THEMSELVES IN A

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.593
POSITION TO BE THE RIDGE- AFTER

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.528
HAVING ACCEPTED KIDS. PUTTING

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.931
KIDS OUT OR- OR SOMETHING OF

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:02.731
THAT NATURE BECAUSE OF THE LOSS

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:04.767
OF FUNDING. THIS MAY BE THE

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:05.868
FIRST TIME CALIFORNIA HAS NOT

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:08.504
FUNDED ITS CHILDREN IN OTHER

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:09.538
WORDS EVERY JOB THAT COMES IN

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:14.777
THE DOOR GET STATE FUNDING- AND

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:15.344
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. THE

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:16.078
SCHOOLS FUND BUT NOT AT THE

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.046
LEVEL OF THE STUDENTS OUT OF

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:19.281
THE YEAR- AND THEN OTHER THIS

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:20.883
OTHER SCHOOLS WHO MADE. MY

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.985
EXPERIENCE THE CLASS- ONCE THEY

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.653
GET TO SINCE HIS DATE. OF WOULD

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.854
OBVIOUSLY BE WE WOULD BE

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:27.356
FUNDING SCHOOLS CHILDREN THAT

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:28.557
DON'T EXIST IN THE CLASSROOM

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.392
SO. I MEAN THAT THAT I THINK

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:31.794
THAT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.696
FOR A CHARTER SCHOOLS TO. TO

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.497
TAKE. BECAUSE WE SEPARATED THEM

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:38.267
OUT IN TERMS OF FUNDING. AND

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:39.301
GROWTH WHICH IS THE MOST

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.670
UNFORTUNATE FOR THEM- AND MOST

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:43.172
UNFORTUNATE FOR FAMILIES

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:43.806
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PARENTS AS

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:45.874
THE- HAVE MADE CHOICES. ABOUT

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.042
WHERE THEY WANT THE KIDS TO GO

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.477
SOMETIMES BASED ON WHAT HAS

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:49.712
HAPPENED THIS PAST YEAR THEY

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:51.847
WANT. AND THEY WANT TO IF

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:52.581
THEY'RE GOING TO DO SOME

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:53.549
DISTANCE LEARNING THAT WE WANT

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.317
A DIFFERENT. STRUCTURE FOR

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:56.685
DISTANCE LEARNING OR SOMETHING

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.454
OF THAT NATURE SO. IT SEEMS

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.823
RATHER- SAY PUNITIVE BUT IT

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:01.957
SEEMS SOMEWHAT PRIMITIVE THAT.

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:03.459
THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE NOT BEING

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:07.997
ADEQUATELY FUNDED- AS WE FUND

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:08.764
EVERYBODY ELSE. M. AND WE

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:10.232
SEPARATED DID NOT CLASSROOM.

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:11.166
BUT WE HAVE A SEPARATED NINE

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:12.635
CLASS. IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:13.802
SETTING. BECAUSE THEY WILL

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:15.237
PROBABLY A LOTS OF NON

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.106
CLASSROOMS OF SCHOOLS. OUT

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:20.142
THERE BE OPENING NEXT WEEK. AND

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:21.343
I THINK THIS AS A RESULT OF

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.812
THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE FUNDING-

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.981
AT AT AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:26.715
IN TERMS OF STUDENTS BUT WE'VE

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:29.051
CHOSEN TO. BASICALLY NOT ALLOW

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.186
THOSE OTHERS TO BE FUNDED THIS

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:33.288
IS AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION. AS

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:34.890
SOON AS CONVERSATION OCCURRED

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:35.491
IN SOME BUDGET HEARING

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:38.227
SOMEWHERE. OF THAT OF. THAT

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.828
OBVIOUSLY I WASN'T PART OF

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:40.329
BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THAT

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:41.964
COMMITTEE BUT NONETHELESS. IT

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:42.965
AFFECTS ALL OF US INTO THE

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:44.500
AFFECT OUR MEMBERS AS WELL AS

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:45.567
THEY GO BACK TO TRY TO EXPLAIN

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:47.636
TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. BY

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:50.105
CERTAIN SCHOOLS ARE NOT BEING

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:52.474
ADEQUATELY FUNDED. SO I'M NOT

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:54.476
SURE. HOW THESE DECISIONS ARE

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:56.278
MADE I SHOULD KNOW BUT I DON'T.

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:58.213
IN SOME ROOM SOMEWHERE- WE'RE

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.848
OBVIOUSLY MEMBERS AND I'VE HAD

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:01.550
SEVERAL MEMBERS ASKED ME ABOUT

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:02.885
THE NOT THE FUNDING OF NINE

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.953
CLASSROOMS IN THIS NEW PROPOSAL

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:05.821
THEY WERE UPSET OVER THE FIRST

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:07.423
RIPPLES OF SO WE'VE MADE SOME

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.625
PROGRESS IN TERMS OF. A DEAL

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:10.292
WITH A BRICK AND MORTAR KIND OF

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:11.994
SET UP SITUATION WHAT THE NEEDS

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.395
ARE EQUALLY GREAT AND I THINK

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:15.397
AS AS A STATE WE RECOGNIZE AND

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:16.231
SOMETIMES WE THINK THAT

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:17.933
DISTANCE LEARNING IS. IS NOT AS

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.168
RIGOROUS AND THAT IS

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:20.636
SIGNIFICANT BUT I THINK WE

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:21.637
PROBABLY LEARNED THAT IN THE

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:24.139
LAST. FOR THREE FOUR MONTHS AS

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:24.807
WE HAVE ENGAGED IN DISTANCE

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:26.875
LEARNING THAT TO DO IT AND TO

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:28.744
DO IT RIGHT IS IT TAKES A LOT

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.579
OF TIME AND ALLOW STAFF TIME. A

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.047
LOT OF RESOURCES AND YET WE'RE

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.949
CUTTING OFF THE RESOURCES TO A

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:35.884
METHOD OF ALL INSTRUCTION THAT

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.653
WE AS A STATE HAVE EMBRACED OUT

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.621
OF NECESSITY. AT THIS POINT AND

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:40.489
PROBABLY WILL HAVE MORE OF OUR

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.690
KIDS NOT IN THE CLASSROOM AND

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:42.725
IN THE CLASSROOM TIS YEAR AND

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:44.059
IT WOULD NOT FUNDING TO TRY TO

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.327
SCHOOLS. WHO ARE DOING THIS

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:47.162
HARD WORK- I THINK AS A AS A

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:48.630
COMMITTEE WE SHOULD RETHINK

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.365
THIS PROPOSAL THAT'S COMING TO

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:52.234
US NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:54.536
NOT IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA. COULD

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.138
NOT FUND THE SCHOOLS. IN

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:57.339
CALIFORNIA ALWAYS FINDS ITS

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:59.274
KIDS EVEN IF IT EVERYBODY GETS

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.676
A MORE OUT THEY GET THAT THEY

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:04.012
GET THE FUNDING THEY KNOW WHAT

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:09.785
IT IS. SO. THANK YOU DON'T WANT

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:12.621

JUSTICE ISSUES AND CURRENTLY-

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:23.765
WITH THE REALIGNMENT OF DJJ THE

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.300
STATE IS FUNDAMENTALLY GETTING

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:26.768
OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF JUVENILE

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.104

TOWARDS MAKING SURE THAT YOUTH

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.525
ARE GIVEN AS MUCH CHANCE AS WE

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:53.027
CAN TO REHABILITATE AND BELIEVE

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:56.431
THERE IS A LOT OF LOGIC BETWEEN.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:57.832
PUTTING IT UNDER HEALTH AND

01:23:57.899 --> 01:24:00.802
HUMAN SERVICES THAT I'M- TRYING

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:02.771
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:04.806
THAT OCCURRED AND I'M SORRY FOR

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:05.874
IT BUT THE BILL THAT AMENDED

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.442
YESTERDAY AND WE'RE SITTING

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:08.576
HERE TODAY ASKING SOME

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.577
QUESTIONS ON IT WE'RE GOING TO

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:11.613
BE ASKED TO. VOTE ON THIS HERE

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:13.348
SHORTLY AND I REALLY WANT TO

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:13.915
MAKE SURE WE'RE KICKING THE

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.750
TIRES BECAUSE I DON'T

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:17.118
UNDERSTAND WHAT A TRANSITION

01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:18.820
LOOKS LIKE SURE AND DOCTOR

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.989
ARAMBULA- THE OFFICE OF YOUTH

01:24:21.055 --> 01:24:22.991
JUSTICE WILL BE CREATED UNDER

01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:25.193
THE HHS UMBRELLA- WITH THE

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.595
LEADERSHIP OF THE EXPERTISE

01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:28.930
THAT'S IN THAT AGENCY AND I

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:34.135
THINK THAT'S- A- BOTH SENTIMENT

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:35.503
AND A PRIORITY THAT THE

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.038
LEGISLATURE HAS EXPRESSED URINE

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:38.306
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:39.307
THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:40.775
THAT'S THE MOST. APPROPRIATE

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:44.813
ENTITY TO PROVIDE KIND OF THE

01:24:44.879 --> 01:24:45.980
STATE LEVEL GUIDANCE GUIDANCE.

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:50.418
WHAT WE- IT LIKE A- AS LUCAS.

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:52.854
IF IADD ON ABOUT TRANSIT AREA

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:55.390
ED I THE AS EIGHT TWENTY THREE

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:57.826
THAT TRANSITION BE WHAT THE

01:24:57.892 --> 01:25:00.295
CLOSURE OF THE WOULD NOT HAPPEN

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:00.862
TWENTY TWENTY THREE BOTH FOR

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.363
THE SUBJECT UNTIL AND THEN FOR

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.599
THE FINAL CLOSURE IN DECEMBER

01:25:04.666 --> 01:25:05.934
AND THE REASON FOR THAT DELAY

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.369
IS TO GIVE COUNTY SOME TIME TO

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.205
DEVELOP THAT OUR RESOURCES SO

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:11.806
THAT THEY ARE PREPARED FOR THIS

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:13.107
TRANSITION BEFORE THE TAKE ON

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:15.810
RESPONSIBILITIES- IT DOES ALSO

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.179
INCLUDE. FUNDING FOR COUNTIES

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:19.514
IF THEY CHOOSE TO WITHDRAW

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:21.883
COUNTIES BUT WITH ALL USED ONLY

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.151
WITHIN THAT DATE AND SO THEY

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:26.154
ARE PREPARED TO DO SO THEY

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:26.754
WOULD BE ABLE TO START DRYING

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:27.989
DOWN SOME OF THAT FUNDING THAT%

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:29.424
BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE USED TO

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:35.864
HELP. OFFSET THE COST. THANK WE

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:38.733
THAT CAN ARE. LET ME ASK IT

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.702
DIFFERENTLY WHAT STEPS THE IN

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:43.204
TAKE TAKEN TO COLLABORATE WITH

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:44.439
KEY STAKEHOLDERS FOR THIS

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:45.840
PROPOSAL HAVE WE TALKED WITH

01:25:45.907 --> 01:25:46.975
COUNTY IS ABOUT THEIR

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:49.444
WILLINGNESS TO RECEIVE THIS

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:55.350
RESPONSIBILITY. ALL YES WE HAD

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:58.586
A SIGNIFICAN COLLABORATION WITH

01:25:58.653 --> 01:25:59.621
THE COUNTY PROBATION

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:02.056
DEPARTMENT'S ASSOCIATION AND-

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:05.226
THAT COUNTY ASSOCIATION AS WELL

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:07.395
ON THE PROPOSAL I THINK THAT

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:08.963
THE TWO MAIN ELEMENTS HERE THAT

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.098
HAVE IT MAKE US FEEL

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:10.965
COMFORTABLE WITH THE

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:13.201
REALIGNMENT IS THAT- THERE WAS

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.003
A SIGNIFICANT REALIGNMENT DONE

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:16.037
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OF

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.672
JUVENILES AND APPEARS TO HAVE

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:20.542
BEEN- VERY PRETTY SUCCESSFUL

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:22.210
THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT YOU-

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:23.978
STAYING CLOSE TO HOME ACTUALLY

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:26.080
HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES- BECAUSE

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:28.116
OF REENTRY SERVICES BEING

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.918
CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILY- TO KIND

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:31.185
OF ILLUSTRATE SORT OF WHAT'S

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:32.253
HAPPENED IN THE JUVENILE

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.489
SYSTEM. SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:36.024
SEVEN THERE WAS ELEVEN THOUSAND

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.625
YOUTH IN JUVENILE DETENTION

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:40.995
FACILITIES LOCALLY NOW THERE IN

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:41.596
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IF THERE

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.064
WAS THIRTY SIX HUNDRED A

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:45.733
DECREASE OF ALMOST 70% SO IT'S

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.268
THOSE THINGS IN MIND- IN

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:49.137
ADDITION TO OUR- YOU KNOW

01:26:49.203 --> 01:26:51.272
SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION HERE

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:52.206
WITH THOSE ENTITIES THAT HAS A

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:53.408
STILL COMFORTABLE THAT THEY ARE

01:26:53.474 --> 01:26:55.209
READY TO TAKE IT ON UNDER OUR

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:57.445
PROPOSAL- I BELIEVE THEY'RE

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:59.047
THEY'RE IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.148
LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL AS A

01:27:00.214 --> 01:27:06.254
RUSE AS CONSTRUCTED AND SB.

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:06.854
EIGHT EIGHT TWENTY THREE CELL

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:09.023
YES JENNIFER COMMITTEE COME

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.858
INTO THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:12.527
CONTRARY THAT WE'RE HEARING A

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:14.495
PROPOSAL THAT THE SEEMS LIKE

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:18.199
THE COUNTIES ARE IN OPPOSITION

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:20.935
TO. THIS IS SO THE K. HAVE

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.103
WEIGHED AND I THINK THEY'VE

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:23.738
PROVIDED CRITIQUE ON BOTH

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.974
PROPOSALS- PART OF THE REASON

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.376
WHY WE CROSS THE BILL WAS THAT

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:29.477
WE CAN HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.980
AND WE'VE- LET THEM KNOW THAT-

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:34.782
NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING- SO WE

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:35.383
ARE INCORPORATING THEIR

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:37.585
FEEDBACK. ON THE JUVENILE COURT

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:39.621
JUDGES ASSOCIATION DID SUBMIT A

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:41.122

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:42.957
LEGISLATURE SUPERBOWL PUZZLES-

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:44.859
ARM SAYING THAT WAS A BALANCED

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.027
APPROACH AND IT ACTUALLY

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.295
PROVIDES A TIMELINE THAT'S

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:49.497
WORKABLE- TO IMPLEMENT THESE

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:51.532
CHANGES ONE OTHER THING I'D

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:53.468
LIKE TO ADD IS THAT CURRENTLY.

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:55.470

OFFENSES- WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM

01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:05.413
ELIGIBLE FOR DJJ. ONLY TWO

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.714
HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:07.782
TWENTY FIVE ARE ACTUALLY SENT

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.951
TO DJJ SO COUNTIES ARE ALREADY

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:12.987
KEEPING ABOUT 97% OF THE YOUNG

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:16.424
PEOPLE- LOCALLY AND SO-

01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:17.558
CONSIDERING HOW SMALL THE

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:20.094
POPULATION IS- I THINK WITH THE

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:22.163
RIGHT RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.097
WE FEEL THAT COUNTIES WOULD BE

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:25.099
EQUIPPED- TO TAKE ON THIS

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:26.968
POPULATION. HOW WILL BE

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:28.970
ADMINISTRATION THEM PLAN TO

01:28:29.037 --> 01:28:30.438
WORK WITH COUNTIES THAT DO NOT

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:34.075
HAVE CAPACITY. FOR THE

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:37.278
APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF YOUTH.

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.480
SO I THINK- THAT WE WOULD ALLOW

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:41.749
COUNTIES TO SORT OF WORK

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:43.384
AMONGST THEMSELVES TO FIGURE I

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.186
DETERMINE THE BEST SITUATION

01:28:45.253 --> 01:28:46.387
FOR THEMSELVES TO FIND

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:48.256
TREATMENT SERVICES FOR YOU I

01:28:48.322 --> 01:28:49.791
THIS IS AN EXISTING PRACTICE

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:52.160
TODAY- AND THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:54.395
AREAS OF OUR PROPOSAL- THAT WE

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:56.264
ORIGINALLY HAD CONTEMPLATED A

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.533
LOT MORE STRUCTURE TO AROUND.

01:28:58.599 --> 01:28:59.467
SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT IN

01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:00.935
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN THIS

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:02.470
YOU KNOW STOP WATCHING THIS-

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:04.839

SPECIFIC SORT OF FUNDING

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:08.543
STREAMS AND CRITERIA AROUND

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:09.877
THAT BUT AFTER A LOT OF

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:10.545
DISCUSSION WITH THE

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:12.180
STAKEHOLDERS IT WAS YOU CAN

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.415
CLEAR THAT- THEY NEED THAT

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:16.050
FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:17.985
WORKS BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY

01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:20.788
AND SOMETIMES MAYBE EVEN NOT.

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:23.224
THAT THE- SORT OF. FEELING THE

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.959
NAME OF BEING AHUB- BUT

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:26.360
FINDING THOSE COUNTIES THAT

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:28.496
HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:29.464
THE CAPACITY THAT HAVE THE

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.065
INTEREST IN PUTTING THAT ON AND

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:32.200
THEN ALLOWING THEM TO TRANSFER

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:33.668
MY FUNDS AMONGST THEMSELVES

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:37.171
ABOUT. HOW TO PROVIDE THOSE

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:38.206
SERVICES LOCALLY. WELL I THINK

EARLIER AND SO I'M JUST TRYING

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:44.979
TO. MAKE SURE WE HAVE A ROBUST

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.014
CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:47.682
TALKING ABOUT A REALIGNMENT

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:49.817
BLOCK GRANT. HOW HOW WILL WE

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:50.718
MAKE SURE THAT THIS FUNDING

FORMULA ENSURES AN EQUITABLE

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.256
DISTRIBUTION THE COUNTIES.

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:55.723
BASED ON WHAT WAS JUST

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:58.459

THE TOTAL EDUCATION FOR H.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.016
ELIGIBLE IT WOULD ALSO

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:24.185
GUARANTEE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF

FUNDING- THE OTHER GRANT

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.661
PROGRAMS IT WOULD ALSO HELP

COUNTY THERE WOULD ALSO BE

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:48.643
ALLOWED TO. CONTRACT WITH OTHERCOUNTIES AND COULD THEY COULD

COVER THOSE COSTS. I TO BE

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:00.955
CLOAKED BUT SOMETIME I CAN'T MY-

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.156
THIS FEEL LIKE A PUTTING THE

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:04.458
BEFORE THE HORSE. AND I WONDER

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:07.261
SOMETIMES HOW WE- MAKE SURE THE

01:31:07.328 --> 01:31:08.729
POLICIES ARE WELL VETTED BEFORE

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:12.233
WERE. HAVING TO EVALUATE THEM

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.734
ASK QUESTIONS AND VOTE ON I'M

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:16.270
IN THE MATTER OF HOURS. AND SO

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.672
I'M WONDERING AGAIN IF I CAN

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:19.407
START WITH MY FIRST QUESTION.

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:21.175
WHAT'S THE URGENCY AND RUSH TO

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.476
DO THIS SINCE THE EXECUTIVE

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:24.478
ORDERS PUSH THIS OFF UNTIL NEXT

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:27.048
YEAR. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:29.116
HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.818
ASK THE APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:33.688
HAVE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:36.157
HAVE DELIBERATIONS BECAUSE- IF

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:38.159
IT CAUGHT ME A LITTLE BIT BY

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:40.928
SURPRISE AND FEEL. FEELS A

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.997
LITTLE CONCERNING TO ME THAT WE

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:44.832
DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:47.335
READY AND THAT- WE COULD

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:49.804
BENEFIT FROM MORE TIME WORKING

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:51.239
ON THIS PROPOSAL AND SO WOULD

01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:54.041
LIKE TO. SEE IF YOU HAVE A-

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:56.177
SLIGHTLY CHANGE RESPONSIBLE.

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:58.279
I'M SO JUST TO KIND OF

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.248
REITERATE REITERATE THAT THE

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:01.515
PROPOSAL ORIGINALLY CAME FROM

01:32:01.582 --> 01:32:03.150
THE GOVERNOR I WILL SAY THAT IN

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.719
OUR SUB COMMITTEE AND I THINK

01:32:04.785 --> 01:32:06.754
IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE POLICY

01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:08.456
PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. THERE

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:10.391
HAVE BEEN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:12.159
ABOUT THE CLOSURE OF THE

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:13.194
DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:15.162
AND REALIGNMENT SO DID THIS

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:17.265
CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ONGOING

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:19.133
FOR AT LEAST A DECADE- AND I

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.336
THINK PART OF THE REASON- THAT

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:24.372
WERE READY TO HAVE IT NOW IS

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:25.740
THAT THE POPULATION HAS GOTTEN

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.808
SO SMALL. UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:31.379
MOST RECENTRECIDIVISM REPORT-

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:33.347
THAT I HAVE ACCESS TO STILL

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:36.918
SHOWS AND OVER 73% RECIDIVISM

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:38.586
RATE AND THE STATE CURRENTLY

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.721
SPENDS APPROXIMATELY THREE

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:41.289
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:42.924
YOUNG PERSON STATED THERE MAY

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:44.392
HAVE BEEN SOME FISCAL REASONS

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.560
AS TO WHY THE GOVERNOR- CHOSE

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:49.163
THIS MOMENT- TO DO THE

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.065
REALIGNMENT- I DON'T WANT TO

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:53.367
SPEAK. ON THEIR BEHALF BUT I

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:55.169
WILL SAY FOR- SOME OF THE OTHER

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:56.404
STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:58.873
INVOLVED THIS IS A POLICY THAT

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:03.311
HAS BEEN KIND OF CRAFTED OVER

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.279
THE YEARS. AND SO THERE ARE

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:06.647
PIECES OF IT THAT HAVE BEEN

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:10.785
VETTED- FOR SOME TIME. I WOULD

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:12.286
JUST TO SORT OF CARE THAT TO

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:14.855
SUGGEST JUST THIS WAS FIRST

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:15.990
BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE NISS

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:18.259
MINISTRATION IN JANUARY OF LAST

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:19.961
YEAR AND THE FIRST BUDGET- NOT

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:21.529
EXACTLY IN THIS FORM WITH THE

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:25.599
MOVING OF DJJ SO WE HAD A YEAR

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:26.167
LONG DISCUSSION LAST YEAR'S

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.269
BUDGET- WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:33:28.336 --> 01:33:29.937
REACH. AGREEMENT WITH SOME OF

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:31.872
THE DETAILS BUT DID AGREE TO

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:36.177
MOVE THE AGENCY THIS YEAR THEY

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:38.145
CAME BACK WITH A- REVISED

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:40.381
PROPOSAL TO NOT MOVE IT TO THE

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:42.583
AGENCY BUT THEN. MOVE IT TO THE

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:47.221
COUNTIES IN SO AT LEAST. L.

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:49.490
WITHIN THIS CAN. THERE'S BEEN A

01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:52.193
PER SICK. AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:55.029
ON ON THIS ON THIS IDEA WITH

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:57.465
THIS ADMINISTRATION FOUR I

01:33:57.531 --> 01:33:59.400
THINK THE BETTER PART OF ALMOST

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:02.203
TWO TWO YEARS- I THINK YOUR

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:04.739
POINT IS WELL TAKEN. BUT I WILL

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:05.639
JUST SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE WE

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.775
HAVE. GREATER STAKEHOLDER

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.243
ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:09.910
WILL HAVE STAKEHOLDER

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:13.481
AGREEMENT. AND SO- AND YOU'RE

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:14.615
WELL AWARE OF THAT FOR MANY OF

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:17.184
THE ISSUES THAT THE COMPLICATED

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:17.785
ISSUES YOU DO WITHIN YOUR SUB

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:21.522
COMMITTEE- AND SO I WOULD SAY-

01:34:21.589 --> 01:34:23.457
I KNOW THAT THIS- THERE'S A LOT

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:27.028
OF DETAIL COMING OUT. ON A FOR

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:28.162
YOU TO DIGEST BUT I WILL SAY

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:30.731
THIS IS THIS HAS BEEN- HERE THE

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:32.166
COMMITTEE HAS SPENT AN ENORMOUS

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:34.568
AMOUNT OF TIME ON THIS. WITH

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:37.838
ALL THE VARIOUS- STAKEHOLDERS

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:39.774
HAS BEEN TRYING TO ENGAGE. I

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.143
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION- THIS

01:34:42.209 --> 01:34:44.378
WAS AGAIN- BASED ON THEY WERE

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:45.713
TRYING TO PRESENT TRY TO HAVE A

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.648
RESOLUTION. ON THEIR ORIGINAL

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.250
JANUARY PROPOSAL THERE MAY

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:51.118
REVISION PROPOSAL IS SOMETHING

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:52.319
THAT WE COMMITTED T TRY TO

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:57.458
RESOLVE BUT- BEFORE WE- CLOSED

01:34:57.525 --> 01:34:59.360
OUT IN A BOX. AND I AM PLEASED

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:00.628
TO THE TIME AND WILL ALLOW TO

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:02.096
HAVE QUESTIONS THAT I WILL JUST.

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:05.666
AND OPINING. HISTORICALLY OUR

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.201
STATE GONE THROUGH DISCUSSIONS

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:08.936
REGARDING REALIGNMENT IN YEARS

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:11.238
AFTER A CENSUS. AND IT SEEMS

01:35:11.305 --> 01:35:13.040
THAT THIS TYPE OF DISCUSSION IF

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:13.974
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:16.143
REALIGNING. RESPONSIBILITIES

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:17.978
AND FINDINGS BETWEEN STATE AND

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:19.847
COUNTIES. THAT THIS DECISION

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:21.482
AND DISCUSSION COULD BENEFIT

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.584
FROM A TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR.

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:25.886
BUT THAT'S- A CONVERSATION FOR

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:28.989
ANOTHER DAY SIMPLY JUST WANTED

HERE VERSUS IN THE VALLEY WHERE

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:50.538
YOU MAY NOT GET MUCH OF

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:54.208
pOF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:55.342
DISPARITY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:56.443
REASONS WHY WE FEEL OVERSIGHT

WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THESE

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:23.103
DIFFERENCES OUT WITH

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:38.152
ADVOCATES AND FLUSH IT OUT AND

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:40.955
THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE FOR OUR

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:42.856

NUMBERS. THAT'S THE THING

01:41:40.561 --> 01:41:42.663
PEOPLE DON'T FIGURE OUT OUT TO

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:44.364
GOT KIDS IN THERE THAT ARE

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:45.232
COMMITTEES ADULTS A SIXTEEN OR

01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:46.834
SEVENTEEN. YOU TALK ABOUT

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.837
HAVING KIDS BEING ALLOWED IN

01:41:49.903 --> 01:41:51.004
THERE TWO OR TWENTY THREE OR

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:51.872
TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD HOW DO WE

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:53.106
DO THAT SEPARATE YOU UNITS

01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:54.908
STAFFING THEY'RE NOT MANY GIRLS

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:56.443
IN THERE SO OBVIOUSLY IF YOU

01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:57.878
HAVE GIRLS IN THERE YOUR COSTS

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:58.278
ARE GOING TO RISE

01:41:58.345 --> 01:42:00.113
EXPONENTIALLY. BECAUSE BECAUSE

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:01.415
A LOT MORE STAFFING THEIR VERY

01:42:01.482 --> 01:42:06.553
TIME INTENSIVE WITH THAT. SO IT

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.187
I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:09.189
QUESTIONS ABOUT IT DEJECTED

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.691

TREATMENT A LOT OF THINGS THAT

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:30.911
EFFECTIVE SO IF ANYBODY THINKS

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:33.146
THEY'RE GOING TO COUNTIES IT'S

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:34.982
GOING TO BE A BETTER PROGRAM

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:36.617
YOU HAD EXAMINED YOUR FRIGGIN

01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:38.418
CRAZY IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AT

01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:41.154
ALL LIKE I SAID IT AND ALSO

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:42.422
LOOK AT THE COUNTY WILL HAPPEN

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:44.424
AB ONE OH NINE THEY'VE BEEN

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:46.059
SUED BY THE PRISON LAW OFFICE

01:42:46.126 --> 01:42:48.095
THEY'VE ALL BEEN SUED OVER

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:49.196
MEDICAL CONDITIONS WHICH SEES

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:50.697
THE AUGUST TWO FOUR AND BUILT A

01:42:50.764 --> 01:42:53.667
HOSPITAL STOCKTON. CONDITIONS A

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:55.435
WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS THAT C.

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:56.637
C. WENT THROUGH FOR MANY MANY

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:58.372
YEARS. THAT ACCOUNT IS GOING

01:42:58.438 --> 01:43:00.474
THROUGH. THE PROCESS POPULATION

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:02.876
IN JUVENILE HALL. IT'S THE SAME

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:06.146
THING. IT'S FAILURE IF I GO

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:08.715
BACK LOOK AB ONE ONLINE WHAT

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:09.316
WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T WORK NO

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:11.385
ONE'S DONE THAT. ESPECIALLY AT

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:12.419
THIS TIME RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.221
TO TAKE THREE YEARS THIS IS.

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:14.855
INCREMENTALLY TWENTY THREE WILL

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:17.424
GUESS WHAT. THIS BUDGET CRISIS

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:18.892
WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. IS GOING

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:20.193
OFF THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS MAYBE

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.996
NEXT THREE YEARS. SO IT'S JUST

01:43:23.063 --> 01:43:24.598
IT'S THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS.

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:26.366
YOU KNOW AND IT REALLY BECOMES

01:43:26.433 --> 01:43:28.101
THESE KIDS WE CAN JUST DROP

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:30.370
KIDS ON THE DOORSTEP WITH A BAG

01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:32.739
OF CASH AND WALK AWAY. IN ALL

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:33.941
COUNTIES AHEAD OF THE CURVE

01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:35.609
WHEN IT COMES TO ADULT AND

01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:38.045
JUVENILE REHABILITATION. SO

01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:40.380
IT'S I MEAN SO I GUESS FOR

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:45.419
FINANCE. WITH ALL THE ACCOLADES

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:48.155
DJJ HAS GARNERED OVER THE YEARS.

01:43:48.221 --> 01:43:50.424
HOW DO YOU CORRELATE THE TWO

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:50.958
WITH THE DROP OFF GOING TO

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:56.263
COUNTIES. CAN YOU TELL ME THAT.

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:58.198
YEAH I THINK THAT THE

01:43:58.265 --> 01:44:01.535
MOTIVATING FACTOR HERE OR WAS

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:04.071
TWO FOLD EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:05.639
THAT YOU'D DO BEST WHEN THEY'RE

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:07.608
LOW CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILIES AND

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:09.843
THEIR COMMUNITIES- AND THEN

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.012
SECOND PULLED WAS THE SUCCESS

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:13.914
THAT COUNTIES HAD IN THE FIRST

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:16.883
JUVENILE- REALIGNMENT FROM THE

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:20.320
STATE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:21.054
AND AS I DISCUSSED THAT

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:23.323
JUVENILE. DID POPULATION FROM

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:26.126
ELEVEN THOUSAND IN 200-072-3600

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:28.261
AND- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

01:44:28.328 --> 01:44:31.832
ALMOST A 70% DECLINE- MO COUNTY

01:44:31.898 --> 01:44:33.300
PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S ACTUALLY

01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:34.801
HANDLE ALMOST THE ENTIRE

01:44:34.868 --> 01:44:37.070
JUVENILE SYSTEM NOW WE ONLY

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:38.605
HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:40.440
YOUTH LEFT AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:41.642
AND IT WAS JUST IT WAS THINKING

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:43.610
ABOUT IT. IS IT BEST FOR THE

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:45.245
STATE TO HOLD ON TO THOSE YOU

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:47.514
OR LET THE COUNTIES WHO FOR

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:48.782
AREN'TDEALING WITH ALMOST ALL

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:49.716
THE YOUTH IN THE STATE AT THIS

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:51.518
POINT YEAH WELL TO EXPAND THEIR

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:53.654
CAPACITIES AND INTAKE ON

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:57.090
INCREMENTALLY A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:44:57.157 --> 01:44:57.724
AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN AND

01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:58.291
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE

01:44:58.358 --> 01:44:59.192
DEMONSTRATED THAT I AND I THINK

01:44:59.259 --> 01:45:01.662
THAT MAKES US FEEL COMFORTABLE.

01:45:01.728 --> 01:45:02.262
THAT THEY ARE THE APPROPRIATE

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:04.197
TO TAKE OUT THE THAT WORK ON

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:05.065
AND SO I THINK THERE'S A

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:06.733
THERE'S A TWO PRONG THING HERE

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.635
THAT- YOU KNOW IT WAS THE

01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:10.370
TIMING OF KOBE THINKING ABOUT A

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.805
FISHING USES A RESOURCE BUT

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:13.507
ALSO A LOT OF SUCCESS THAT

01:45:13.573 --> 01:45:15.342
WE'VE SEEN IN SEEING THAT USE

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:16.877
CAN BE- TO BETTER AT THE LOCAL

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:19.012
LEVEL AND AS IT RELATES TO. YOU

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:20.747
KNOW EVERY COUNTY HAVING REALLY

01:45:20.814 --> 01:45:22.115
SPECIALIZED TREATMENT PROGRAMS

01:45:22.182 --> 01:45:23.550
WE DON'T ENVISION THAT I DON'T

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:24.518
THINK THE COUNTIES ENVISIONED

01:45:24.584 --> 01:45:26.553
THAT IT'S DAY ENVISION ACTUALLY

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.654
HAVING YOU KNOW SORT OF

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:29.056
REGIONAL PLACES WHERE THEY WILL

01:45:29.122 --> 01:45:30.691
GO AND HAVE THAT SPECIALIZED

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.325
TREATMENT- THEY JUST DIDN'T

01:45:32.392 --> 01:45:33.894
WANT THAT PRESCRIBED IN STATE

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.328
LAW AND HOW THAT WOULD BE BE

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:37.197
PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE- DIFFERENT

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:37.898
COUNTIES HAVE DIFFERENT

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:39.733
RESOURCES. AND THEY WANT TO BE

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.001
ABLE TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:42.803
TO DO WHAT WORKS BEST BASED ON

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:44.905
WHAT THEY HAVE SO THOUGHT THAT

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:46.573
THAT WAS THE THINKING THERE-

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.809
AND I YOU KNOW WE I THINK IT

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:50.444
DEREK THERE IS MERIT TO THE

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:51.611
PROPOSAL WELL THE THINKING

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:53.480
SLIDE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:59.453
TWO. DJJ THE KIDS ARE THEY THAT

01:45:59.519 --> 01:46:01.188
THE NUMBER SMALL. BUT ALSO THE

01:46:01.254 --> 01:46:01.888
MOST VILE. PEOPLE THAT THE

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:02.856
ADDRESS THAT'S THAT'S THE-

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:04.758
ANALYSTS SAY BUT THAT'S- HIGH

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:07.060
PROFILE PEOPLE BETTER THEIR

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:08.261
SOUL AND IT IS PUSHED UP THE

01:46:08.328 --> 01:46:09.563
COUNTIES THE COUNTIES ALL HAVE

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:12.666
THE SAME RESOURCES IT'S LIKE AB

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:15.535
ONE ONLINE. FOR STATE PRISONS.

01:46:15.602 --> 01:46:16.470
IT'S ALL OVER THE BOARD WITH

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:19.673
THAT. SO THE CATTLE HAD DIDN'T

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:20.140
HAVE THE MONEY OF THE

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.942
CAPABILITIES TO DO IT. THAT'S

01:46:22.008 --> 01:46:24.878
THAT WE DON'T GET THAT. LIKE I

01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:25.712
SAID YOU KEEP GOING BACK TO

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:27.547
SMALL POPULATIONS ALL OVER ALL

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.549
OVER THE STATE. THOSE COUNTIES

01:46:29.616 --> 01:46:30.751
ARE GONNA HIRE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:32.753
EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:35.355
SALARIES YOU PAY A LOT OF SONGS

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:36.957
FOR CLINICIAN. FOR A- THE-

01:46:37.023 --> 01:46:39.359
PSYCHOLOGIST. IN THOSE PROGRAMS

01:46:39.426 --> 01:46:40.360

01:46:40.427 --> 01:46:42.162
PROGRAMS. LOOK AT THE MONEY AND

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:44.731

01:46:48.502 --> 01:46:50.137
THE IN THE POPULATION HIGH

01:46:50.203 --> 01:46:52.439

THEY CAN DO IT IS REALLY

01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:58.645
DISINGENUOUS. EVEN TO SERVICE

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:00.514
TO THE CITIZENS AND THOSE KIDS

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.883

YEARS TO GET THERE TO MAKE DJJ

01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:08.588
THAT WAY. BECAUSE OF LAWSUITS

01:47:08.655 --> 01:47:09.089
BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:11.124
HAPPENED. IF YOU GO BACK TO THE

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:12.659
COUNTIES THE SAME THING COULD

01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:14.227
HAPPEN. IT'S LIKE IT'SLIKE A

NOW. THE NUMBERS ARE LOW. IT

01:47:21.935 --> 01:47:24.070
WORKS IT'S EFFECTIVE THESE KIDS

01:54:28.261 --> 01:54:30.964
THE LIST INCLUDES- OF PUBLIC

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.166

PAY THE FEE AND MY CONCERN IS.

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:02.428
THAT BY ELIMINATING THE COURT'S

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:03.563

THAT REVENUE WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:10.236
DOING IS WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THE

PEAS FEES. ON THE MUCH. THE

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:53.212
LITTLEST WAS MUCH LONGER- AND

01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:54.781
THESE WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING

01:55:54.847 --> 01:55:58.418
THE MOST KIND OF EVERY DAY- UP

01:55:58.484 --> 01:56:00.320

POVERTY. IS NOT SOMETHING

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.629
THAT'S CRIMINALIZED. BUT THE

01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:10.897
WAY YOU DO THAT IS TO FIGURE

01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:12.131

JUST TO MAKE THE POINT. WE HEAR

01:56:29.349 --> 01:56:30.883

LEGISLATURE EXPRESSED AN INTENT

01:56:51.771 --> 01:56:52.438
TO DO THAT AND THEN FAILED TO

01:56:52.505 --> 01:56:55.007
DO IT AND SO. I HAVE A FURTHER

01:56:55.074 --> 01:56:57.977

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:14.340
WHAT OUR UNDERSTANDING BEHIND

THAT'S A BIG ISSUE A LOT OF

02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:20.373
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS I THINK

02:01:20.439 --> 02:01:21.774
LIKE I SAID I THE PURPOSE OF

02:01:21.841 --> 02:01:23.109
THE BILL I CAN ACCEPT TO HELP

02:01:23.175 --> 02:01:24.510
PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE A LOT OF THE

02:01:24.577 --> 02:01:26.445
DEVIL'S REALLY IN THE DETAILS.

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:28.014
ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS.

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.281
NOW AS FAR AS VICTIM

02:01:29.348 --> 02:01:30.750
RESTITUTION HAS THAT FULL THAT

02:01:30.816 --> 02:01:32.585
GO AWAY. WE'RE THE FALL LINE

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:40.226
WITH THAT. IN OUR REVIEW OF

02:01:40.292 --> 02:01:42.361

THAT ARE IMPACTED RESTITUTION

02:01:43.829 --> 02:01:45.765
WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS

02:01:45.831 --> 02:01:49.001
TRAILER BILL. OKAY WE ALSO JUST

02:01:49.068 --> 02:01:50.336
SO YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE COME IN

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:51.170
AND DO THESE THINGS WITH

02:01:51.237 --> 02:01:52.104
SOMEONE THAT CAME IN IN THEIR

02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:53.205
OWN WORK PROJECT WAS A

02:01:53.272 --> 02:01:54.540
COMMANDER THERE AND THEY WERE

02:01:54.607 --> 02:01:55.708
UNEMPLOYED YET THAT PERSON HAD

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.576
A TRUST FUND SO OBVIOUSLY SOME

02:01:57.643 --> 02:01:58.811
OF THE TRUST FUND CAN AFFORD TO

02:01:58.878 --> 02:02:00.680

02:02:00.746 --> 02:02:03.215
DRIVING SO- THAT'S ONE THING I

02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:04.483
MEAN LIKE SAID WE CAN GET THERE

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:06.118
WITH THOSE PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE

02:02:06.185 --> 02:02:07.753
SOME FOLKS THAT CAMPAIGN SHOULD

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:10.189
PAY LOOK AT THE CELEBRITIES

02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:11.290
THAT HAVE GOTTEN PROFESSIONAL

02:02:11.357 --> 02:02:12.925
ATHLETES THAT HAVE GOT ARRESTED

02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:15.561
FOR DRUNK DRIVING. SO THAT'S

02:02:15.628 --> 02:02:17.329
KIND OF THE RUB WHERE UNDER

02:02:17.396 --> 02:02:20.132
THIS PROPOSAL THOSE FOLKS THAT

02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:23.402

GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. IS THAT

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:28.140
IS THAT CORRECT. THEY'RE

THE SAME GROUP. CORRECT. IT

02:02:41.053 --> 02:02:42.421
WOULD ELIMINATE ACROSS THE

02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:45.324
BOARD AND THE ABILITY TO ASSESS

02:02:45.391 --> 02:02:49.995

02:02:50.062 --> 02:02:51.764
MY BIG ISSUE WITH THAT AXE. AS

02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:54.033
A NIGHT INSTEAD OF THE STATE.

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:55.201

02:02:55.267 --> 02:02:57.603
POOR THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT

02:02:57.670 --> 02:02:59.071

WHOLESALE AND RETAIL PRICE OF

CANNABIS. CD TFA DETERMINES

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.061
WHETHER IT WILL ADJUST THE MARK

UP RATE EVERY SIX MONTHS ONCE

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:34.533
IN JANUARY AND ONCE IN JULY.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:35.868
THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:37.236
DEPARTMENT FROM ADJUSTING THE

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:38.904
MARK UP RATE. THAT WOULD

02:04:38.971 --> 02:04:41.307
OTHERWISE OCCUR INJANUARY

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:42.208
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF DOING SO

02:04:42.274 --> 02:04:44.276
RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE

EXCISE TAX RATE. FUTURE

02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:47.279
ADJUSTMENTS HOWEVER WOULD

02:04:47.346 --> 02:04:49.315
REMAIN IN PLACE. ULTIMATELY

02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:50.316
THIS WOULD EITHER HAVE NO

02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:52.451
EFFECT ON THE TAX RATE WERE

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:55.688
TEMPORARILY REDUCE. IN ADDITION

02:05:02.962 --> 02:05:04.430
CULTIVATION TAX RATE ANNUALLY

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:06.765
IN JANUARY TO ACCOUNT FOR

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:08.767
INFLATION THIS BILL WOULD

02:05:08.834 --> 02:05:10.669
PROHIBIT THEM FROM MAKING THAT

02:05:10.736 --> 02:05:11.604
ADJUSTMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY

02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:13.873
ONE. UNLESS IT IS TO ACCOUNT

02:05:13.939 --> 02:05:15.241
FOR A NEGATIVE INFLATION RIGHT

02:05:15.307 --> 02:05:17.076
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNLIKELY

02:05:17.142 --> 02:05:18.110
WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:19.311
DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT OF THE

02:05:19.378 --> 02:05:20.779
RIGHT HOWEVER FUTURE

02:05:20.846 --> 02:05:22.214
ADJUSTMENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:24.149
TAKE PLACE THE BILL WOULD ALSO

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:26.085
LIMIT THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO

02:05:26.151 --> 02:05:28.621

02:05:28.687 --> 02:05:29.822
YEAR OF A VIOLATION. RATHER

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:31.290
THAN TO AS A RESULT THE

02:05:31.357 --> 02:05:32.758
CULTIVATION TAX RATE WOULD

02:05:32.825 --> 02:05:34.994
NEVER CATCH UP OR COMPENSATE

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:37.162
FOR THE MISSED ADJUSTMENT IN

02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:39.365
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND AN

02:05:39.431 --> 02:05:39.965
ONGOING REDUCTION WOULD RESULT

02:05:40.032 --> 02:05:41.967
WOULD RESULT. LET ME NOW TURN

02:05:42.034 --> 02:05:43.869
TO THE CHANGES RELATED TO THE

02:05:43.936 --> 02:05:44.370

HOWEVER UNDER THIS BILL THAT

I APOLOGIZE. YEAH NOTHING

02:07:02.314 --> 02:07:03.449
FURTHER FURTHER TO HAVE THANK

02:07:03.515 --> 02:07:15.894
YOU. OKAY MISTER MONTE. ALL

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:19.331
RIGHT ACT. TO THE L. A. L. I. I

02:07:19.398 --> 02:07:22.167
JUST HAVE TO ASK. WHAT DOES

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:25.838
THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE BUDGET.

02:07:25.904 --> 02:07:30.342
ALL THIS IS- THIS HAS TO DO

02:07:30.409 --> 02:07:32.244
WITH IMPLEMENTING THE ARMS

02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:34.947
TAXES- THAT ARE ASSUMED IN A

02:07:35.014 --> 02:07:36.448
**** BUDGET SO THIS IS

02:07:36.515 --> 02:07:38.350
BASICALLY. IMPLEMENTING SOME

02:07:38.417 --> 02:07:41.954
TAX CHANGES- THAT ARE A PART OF

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:45.357
THE OVERALL BUDGET PACKAGE OKAY.

02:07:45.424 --> 02:07:46.925
SO I'M NOT FOR THE RECORD I

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:48.027
AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT WE'RE

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:49.094
DOING IN THIS BILL ACTUALLY

02:07:49.161 --> 02:07:51.897
BUT- IT'S UNUSUALLY BLATANT IN

02:07:51.964 --> 02:07:53.365
THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO

02:07:53.432 --> 02:07:54.433
DO WITH THE BUDGET USUALLY WE

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:55.801
AT LEAST THROW IN OUR

02:07:55.868 --> 02:07:57.936
PREPARATION OR TWO AS A TOKEN

02:07:58.003 --> 02:07:58.971
SO THAT WE COULD WAVE OUR HANDS

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:01.173
AND SAY IT'S A BUDGET BILL. BY

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.174
YOUR ARGUMENT WE SHOULDN'T EVEN

02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:03.842
HAVE A COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:06.178
TAXATION BECAUSE WELL ALL OF

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:07.046
THAT SHOULD GO THROUGH THE

02:08:07.112 --> 02:08:08.013
BUDGET COMMITTEE INSTEAD OF

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:09.415
THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE

02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:11.283
AND THE SHAME OF IT IS. THERE'S

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:12.384
NO NEED FOR THIS TO BE A BUDGET

02:08:12.451 --> 02:08:13.419
TRAILER BILL BECAUSE IT'S

02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:15.254
ALREADY A TWO THIRDS BILL

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:18.457
BECAUSE IT CHANGES A U. MA. AT

02:08:18.524 --> 02:08:20.659
THE END AS YOU KNOW A POLICY

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:21.760
THAT THE ONLY ADVANTAGE OF

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:22.594
HAVING SOMETHING BE A BUDGET

02:08:22.661 --> 02:08:24.563
BILL THIS SO THAT IT CAN TAKE

02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:25.864
IMMEDIATE EFFECT WITHOUT A TWO

02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:26.965
THIRDS VOTE IT'S GOING TO BE A

02:08:27.032 --> 02:08:29.168
TWO THIRDS BILL ANYWAY SO THIS

02:08:29.234 --> 02:08:29.701
THIS BILL SHOULD HAVE GONE

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:31.503
THROUGH POLICY COMMITTEE- AND

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:34.273
I'M I'M- I'M SORRY THAT IT DID

02:08:34.339 --> 02:08:38.177
NOT- ANOTHER QUESTION IF YOU

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:39.578
WERE. TESTIFYING ABOUT THE

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:40.879

THE RATIONALE FOR PUTTING

02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:44.950
DIFFERENT RESIDENCY

02:08:45.017 --> 02:08:48.220

DIFFERENT BODIES. I WOULD HAVE

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:54.526
TO DEFER THAT QUESTION AS TO

02:08:54.593 --> 02:08:56.695
WHAT THE- THE ORIGINAL TENT WAS

02:08:56.762 --> 02:08:57.663
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE ORIGINAL

02:08:57.729 --> 02:09:00.165
TIME WAS BUT- I WOULD DEFER THE

02:09:00.232 --> 02:09:01.366

LAST PROVISION IN SB EIGHT

02:10:59.918 --> 02:11:00.819

ONE SCHOOL YEAR. THE LANGUAGE

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:09.561
PRESENTS SERIOUS EQUITY ISSUES

02:11:09.628 --> 02:11:11.930
AND HIRES A VERY STUDENTS WHO

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:12.531
ARE ALREADY FACING SIGNIFICANT

02:11:12.598 --> 02:11:14.566
DISADVANTAGES INCLUDING LOW

02:11:14.633 --> 02:11:16.368

CHILDREN ARE CURRENTLY IN

CLASSROOM BASED SETTINGS BUT

ARE CURRENTLY AND DISTANCE

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:25.544
LEARNING RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THE

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:26.912
TYPES OF DISADVANTAGES THAT A

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:28.981
PLUS SERVICE IT SCHOOLS ARE IN

02:11:29.047 --> 02:11:30.449
CONSTANT POSITION OF PLANT

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:32.651
GROWTH SO THEIR PLAN GROWTH

02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:34.820
AVERAGES ABOUT 10220% ACROSS

02:11:34.886 --> 02:11:37.055
ITS NETWORK REGARDLESS OF THE

02:11:37.122 --> 02:11:39.958
CULPRIT PANDEMIC SO AB FIFTEEN

02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:40.959
OH FIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

02:11:41.026 --> 02:11:42.694
THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT'S

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:44.196
ABOUT SCHOOLS AND TWO YEARS

02:11:44.263 --> 02:11:45.998
THERE ARE NO SCHOOLS WERE TALK

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:46.565
ABOUT EXISTING SCHOOLS THAT

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:48.233
NEED TO BE FUNDED NOW. WE

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:49.301
THOUGHT WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:50.702
SIGNED THE SB NINETY EIGHT BILL

02:11:50.769 --> 02:11:51.770
THAT HE WOULD TALK ABOUT

02:11:51.837 --> 02:11:53.538
FUNDING ALL TARGETED SOLUTIONS

02:11:53.605 --> 02:11:54.840
FOR ALL STUDENTS BUT

02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:56.408
UNFORTUNATELY- SB EIGHT TWENTY

02:11:56.475 --> 02:11:58.543
MISSES THE MARK AND AS A RESULT

02:11:58.610 --> 02:11:59.711
IT'S GOING TO UNDER FUND A LOT

02:11:59.778 --> 02:12:00.412
OF STUDENTS WHO ARE NON

02:12:00.479 --> 02:12:02.414
CLASSROOM BASE SETTINGS WE WAS

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:04.349
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT AS A

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:07.252
SOLUTION. FUND THE 10% GROWTH

02:12:07.319 --> 02:12:09.021
THAT IS ALREADY AVERAGE FOR THE

02:12:09.087 --> 02:12:11.456
SCHOOLS ON A TYPICAL SITUATION

02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:12.691
THAT WOULD BE A COMPROMISE IN

02:12:12.758 --> 02:12:14.359
OUR OPINION BUT THE NOT TO

02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:15.894
EXCLUDE THEM FROM TOTAL FUNDING

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:17.562
IS REALLY JUST MISSING THE MARK

02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:18.797
AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE THE

02:12:18.864 --> 02:12:19.998
