BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER THREE AND- I'LL BE CHAIRING POLKA TODAY'S HEARING BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK CHAIR OF ASTM COMMITTEE CANNOT BE WITH US TODAY. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE E. S. T. M. LEGISLATIVE HEARING THAT WAS SCHEDULED FOR ONE THIRTY IS CANCELED. THOSE BILLS WILL BE HEARD AT THE STM COMMITTEES NEXT LEGISLATIVE HEARING. AND NEXT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL TO THIS JOINT HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS COMMITTEE AND THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER THREE. TODAY WE ARE GATHERED TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF A ROBUST PESTICIDE REGULATORY PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA AND TO RECEIVE AN INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW. OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION OR DPR. PESTICIDES ARE UNIQUE FROM OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES WHILE MOST ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS ARE AN UNWANTED BY PRODUCT OF ANOTHER PROCESS SUCH AS AFFLUENT FROM A MANUFACTURING PLANT OR EMISSIONS FROM AN AUTOMOBILE ENGINE ENGINE. PESTICIDES ARE CHEMICALS DESIGNED TO HARM A TARGET PASSED AND ARE PURPOSEFULLY PURPOSELY INTRODUCED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT TO MANAGE VIRUSES BACTERIA INSECTS WEEDS RODENTS AND OTHER PESTS. PESTICIDES UNFORTUNATELY CAN ALSO HARM PEOPLE ANIMALS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WHILE PESTICIDES CERTAINLY CAN BE USEFUL AND ARE AT TIMES ESSENTIAL. AS SUBSTANCES WITH INHERENT TOXICITY THE BENEFITS OF PESTICIDE USE MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST TE RISKS TO PUBLIC HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND NON TARGET ORGANISMS. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TASKED DPR WITH PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT BY REGULATING PESTICIDE SALES AND USE AND BY FOSTERING REDUCED RISK PEST MANAGEMENT. WHICH IS THEIR MISSION. OVER THE NEXT YEAR MY COMMITTEE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY COMMITTEE PLAN TO HOLD A SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS AND POTENTIAL HEARINGS ON WHETHER AND HOW DPR IS EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACHIEVING ITS MISSION. THIS HEARING IS THE FIRST OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND IS MEANT TO PROVIDE BACKGROUND AND A BROAD OVERVIEW OF PESTICIDE USE AND REGULATION IN CALIFORNIA AND A DPR. SO THIS IS THE OVERVIEW HEARING. BUT FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WILL INCLUDE A MORE CRITICAL LOOK AT THE PR'S EXECUTION OF ITS MISSION. AND AT HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT THEM AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH FROM THE IMPACTS OF PESTICIDES. TELL THAT TO THAT END TODAY WITH US ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S LEADING RESEARCHERS TO COME BEFORE US TO GIVE A BRIEF PRESENTATION ON HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PESTICIDES WE'VE ALSO ASK HOW E. P. A. NDP R. TO DISCUSS THEIR VISION. ON PESTICIDE REGULATION IN CALIFORNIA TO DESCRIBE THEIR PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS AND EXPLAINED HOW THEIR ACTIONS SAFEGUARD OUR PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENT AND SUPPORT A TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. BEFORE WE GET STARTED I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES THAT WE HAVE WITH US HERE TODAY WHO HAVE TRAVELED TO THE CAPITOL TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY OF THE ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AND I MUST SAY IT'S VERY NICE TO HAVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. PREPARED TO TESTIFY INSTEAD OF- HAVING AT- OVER- OF THE- AUDIO VISUAL LINKS THAT WE'VE HAD FOR SO MANY MONTHS NOW SO IT'S A NICE- TRANSITION- I UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL PROBABLY STILL CONSISTS TEN YEAR TO HAVE- SOME OF BOTH KINDS OF- OF- TESTIMONY. BUT IT IS NICE TO SEE THE TRANSITION. PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SHARE THEIR VIEWS AT THE END OF THE HEARING EITHER IN PERSON OR OVER THE PHONE LINE. WE WILL BEGIN WITH. OF. EXPERTS. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH FOR A SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY SECRETARY JARED BLUMENFELD IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY. IN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN HERE SIR. IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AT CHAD MEMBERS THANK YOU- J. AND- AND- REPORT- MICHAEL THANK- SAYS ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS CHAIRWOMAN HEY AT NOW IS NOT NOW WE GOT MICROPHONE YES YEP PERFECT. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE IT MY NAME IS CHAIRWOMAN HELD I'M THE SECRETARY OF CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS DPR. IS ONE OF THE SIX BOARDS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES ON THE COUNTY PA- AS SECRETARY AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM- WITH SUPER PROUD OF THE WORK HAPPENING AT DPR. TO FURTHER ITS MISSION TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS A CRITICAL PART OF OUR BROADER WHACK AT COUNTY PA TO SOLVE MANY OF THE PRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES IN OUR STATE. THAT ARE BEING EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE ENSURING THAT WE'RE PRIORITIZING EQUITY THROUGHOUT OUR WORK IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY COUNTY PA'S BOARDS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES. SIX F. M. THAT WE'RE HAVING TRANSLATES NATIONALLY IS OTHER STATES AND FEDERAL AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOK TO CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES. DPR AS ROBUST PESTICIDE REGULATORY SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE SAFE APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES. TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AB AND PEST PRESSURES AND TO SUPPORT. FOOD SUPPLY STABILITY. ONE THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S VEGETABLES AND TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY'S FRUITS AND NUTS ARE GROWN IN OUR STATE. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTES AN ANNUAL FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. AND DPR OVERSEES THE STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT OF PESTICIDE USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH ARE ENFORCED LOCALLY BY THE STATE'S FIFTY FIVE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PR. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO FOSTERS THE USE OF SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND PRACTICES. DPR AS NEW DIRECTOR JULIE HENDERSON- SPEAK IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF LACK OF VISION FOR THE UTURE IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF EFFECTIVELY REGULATING PESTICIDES IT IS TO ACCELERATE A SYSTEM WIDE TRANSITION TO SAFER. MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT FIT FULL THE DEPARTMENT AS WE TRANSITION TO THIS NEW FUTURE. SHE'S NOT ONLY AN INCREDIBLY CAPABLE MANAGER- HAS A REALLY CLEAR VISION OF WHERE SHE WANTS TO GO. BUT ALSO HAS AN INCREDIBLY GOOD LISTEN- AND WHETHER THAT PHAM GROUPS OR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY THERE'S A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER INTEREST IN THE TRANSITION THAT YOU ALL I'M HEARING TODAY. WITH A CHANGING CLIMATE WHICH IS LIKELY TO BRING NEW AND DIFFERENT PEST PRESSURES IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ACCELERATE THIS TRANSITION TO ADVANCE EQUITY IN PUBLIC HEALTH. FOR POLLINATOR AND SOIL HEALTH FOR CLEAN AIR AND WATER THE RECENSION TWELVE STATES AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN CURTAILING THE USE OF HIGH RISK PESTICIDES. AT THE CLOSE OF TWENTY TWENTY WE ENDED VIRTUALLY ALL THE USE OF CHLORPYRIFOS. A DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROTOXIN ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS IN CHILDREN AND OTHER SENSITIVE POPULATIONS. CALIFORNIA'S ACTION WAS FOLLOWED BY THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BANNING THE USE OF CHLORPYRIFOS AND FOOD CROPS YOU TO RESET SHARING THE LINK TO NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE IN CHILDREN. AND DPR JUST PROPOSED COMPREHENSIVE REGULATIONS TO LIMIT THE USE OF FOR NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE PESTICIDES TO REDUCE RISK TO POLLINATORS. THE DEPARTMENT HAS AVOIDED RESEARCH AND OUTREACH GRANTS TO EXPAND THE SUITE OF AVAILABLE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND PRACTICES. AND TO ACCESS THEM TO PROVIDE CRADLES OF CRITICAL SUPPORT TO THIS TRANSITION. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN A KEY PARTNER IN THAT SHIFT THROUGH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH TO INCREASE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES AND ENSURING THAT THE RESEARCH IS TRANSLATED INTO PRACTICE. AS A RESULT OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS DPR OPENED FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY NEW INNOVATIVE AND REDUCE RISK PAST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN BOTH AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN SETTINGS. ONE SPECIFIC WAY WITH FOCUSING ACROSS SET OUT FOSTERING CROSS SECTOR COLLABORATION FOR BROADER ADOPTION OF SAFER ALTERNATIVES ACROSS THE STATE IS THROUGH TE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WHAT GROUP. WHICH WE CONVENING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THE GROUP'S CHARGES TO IDENTIFY A ROADMAP AND AMBITIOUS MEASURABLE GOALS FOR ACCELERATING A SYSTEM WIDE TRANSITION TO SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT IN AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN SETTINGS. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER EQUITY IS A CRITICAL PRIORITY FOR CALLIE PA AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT. FOR DPR THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE MOVE TO SAFER PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR MOST BURDEN COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDING THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT PESTICIDES APPLIED AROUND THEM. WE'RE EXCITED BY THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE PESTICIDE APPLICATION NOTIFICATION SYSTEM WHICH IS NOW UNDERWAY. APPROVAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS SHOWS YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER AS THAT WORK CONTINUES. DIRECTOR HENDERSON WILL BE PROVIDING MORE DIGITAL DETAILS IN HER REMARKS WE'RE EXCITED TO CONTINUE COLLABORATING WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ALONG WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE P. R. HASTHE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO FULFILL ITS MISSION TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND PROVIDES THE STATE'S TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THREE OH SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT LAUNCH LAST MONTH A STUDY ON ITS LARGEST REVENUE SOURCE THE MIDDLE ASSESSMENT. ENSURING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS A SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE THAT INCENTIVIZES THIS TRANSITION IS CRITICAL. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS. CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR MARCIN WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON THE MIDDLE ASSESSMENT AND THE DEPARTMENTS MIL STUDY IN HER REMARKS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND YOUR INTEREST. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. BURKE YOUR. THERE WE GO THANK YOU SECRETARY- APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR SECRETARY BLUMENFELD. SEEING NONE WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND THANK YOU. RECEIVE NOW TO HEAR FROM DR KIM HARLEY OF UC BERKELEY GO BEARS. DR HARLEY IS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT UC BERKELEY AND WE'VE ASKED HER TO SPEAK TO US TODAY ABOUT WHY DO WE AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PESTICIDE REGULATORY PROGRAM. IN CALIFORNIA. WELCOME. THANK YOU THIS IS NOT. GOOD AFTERNOON AS YOU'VE HEARD I'M A PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND KIM HURLEY PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT UC BERKELEY AND I AM A LEAD RESEARCHER ON THE JAMARCO STUDY WHICH IS THE LONGEST RUNNING LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY OF THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN- OF CALIFORNIA FARMWORKERS I HAVE SPENT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF MY CAREER RESEARCHING HOW MOTHERS AND CHILDREN IN AGRICULTURE COMMUNITIES ARE EXPOSED TO PESTICIDES AND HOW THIS IMPACTS THEIR HEALTH. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF TWO DIFFERENT DE PR WORKING GROUP'S I SERVED ON THE CLIP YOUR FILES AND CLICK HERE FASSEL TURNED HIS WORKGROUP AND I'M NOW ON THE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP THAT SECRETARY BLUMENFELD JUST MENTIONED- WHICH IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO DEVELOP A ROADMAP FOR SAFER SUSTAINABLE PESTICIDE PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA WHILE STILL SUPPORTING OUR VIBRANT AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHY WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT PESTICIDE REGULATION IN CALIFORNIA- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A FEW REASONS- FIRST THE PESTICIDES THAT WE PUT ON FIELDS DON'T STAY THERE. THEY END UP WASHING INTO SURFACE WATERS LIKE RIVERS AND STREAMS WHERE THEY CAN IMPACT QUICKLY AND OUR DRINKING WATER. ARE THEY ALSO DRIFT INTO THE AIR INSIDE PEOPLE'S HOMES AND EVEN INTO OUR BODIES. SO AIR MONITORING SYSTEMS TELL US THAT AFTER PESTICIDES ARE USED ON FEELS THEY CAN LATER BE DETECTED IN- ERR UP TO TWO TO FIVE MILES AWAY DEPENDING ON THE COMPOUNDS AND HOW IT WAS APPLIED- IN OUR WE FOUND THAT 98% OF HOMES HAD DETECTABLE PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN THEIR HOUSE DUST. IN THE LEVELS WERE HIGHER WHEN PEOPLE LIVE CLOSE IN A FIELD WHERE PASS THESE PESTS AS WE USED. WE ALSO DETECTED PESTICIDES IN PEOPLE'S BODIES FOR EXAMPLE WE TOOK URINE SAMPLES FROM PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIVING IN A FARMWORKER COMMUNITY. AND FOUND THAT ALL OF THEM. HAD DETECTABLE PESTICIDES IN THEIR URINE. WE'VE ALSO FOUND PESTICIDES IN THEIR BLOOD SAMPLES AND EVEN IN BREAST MILK. SO WE KNOW PESTICIDES ARE GETTING INTO PEOPLE'S BODIES WHEN THEY LIVE NEAR FIELDS OR WHEN THEY LIVE WITH PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE FIELDS ARE BRINGING PESTICIDES HOME ON THEIR CLOTHING OR OTHER PATHWAYS. THE SECOND REASON I THINK PERSONALLY THE MOST CRITICAL REASON. IS THE PESTICIDE THE PESTICIDE REGULATION IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE HAVE VERY STRONG EVIDENCE THE PESTICIDE USE IMPACTS BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN LIVING IN AGRICULTURE COMMUNITIES. OUT ONE OF THE CLASSES OF PESTICIDES THAT ARE JAMARCO STUDY HAS BEEN RESEARCHING FOR MANY YEARS. IS THE CLASS CALLED ORGANIC PHOSPHATES WHICH ARE POTENT NEUROTOXINS- CLIP YOUR FAUCET YOU JUST HEARD MENTIONED. BY THE PESTICIDE THAT WAS BANNED BY DPR IN TWENTY NINETEEN IS AN ORGANOPHOSPHATE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE ORGAN OF FACETS- AND THE WAY WE'RE GONNA FOSSEY'S WORK IS THE EFFECTIVELY SHUT DOWN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM EVENTS IN SACKS. AND THEY CAN DO THE SAME THING IN MAMMALS INCLUDING HUMANS. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ADULTS IS WHEN AN ADULT IS POISONED BY ORGANIC PHOSPHATE PESTICIDES IT CAUSES CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE THAT CAN LEAD TO PARALYSIS AND EVEN DEATH. BUT WHEN WE STARTED OUR RESEARCH TWENTY YEARS AGO WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE EFFECTS. OF CHRONIC LOW DOSE ON GOING EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES WORDS ON THE DEVELOPING BRAIN OF CHILDREN WHO LIVE NEARBY. SO IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND WE ENROLLED SIX HUNDRED PREGNANT WOMEN LIVING IN FROM MARKET COMMUNITIES IN THE SALINAS VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE FOLLOWED THESE WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS THE KIDS ARE YOUNG ADULTS NOW. AND WE SEE THEIR CHILDREN EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS AND CONTRACT SORRY ONE TO TWO YEARS AND CONDUCT DETAILED HEALTH EXAMS AND NERD OF ELEMENTAL TEST BATTERIES ON THEM MOTHERS WHO HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF AGAIN A FAUCET MUSCLE METABOLITES IN THEIR URINE DURING PREGNANCY. HAD CHILDREN WITH MORE ABNORMAL REFLEXES AT BIRTH. POOR VERBAL ABILITY IS H. THREE N. H. FIVE. LOWER IQ AT AGE SEVEN- AND SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE COMPARED KIDS WHOSE MOMS HAD THE HIGHEST LEVELS WERE GONNA FAUCETS IN THEIR BODIES TO THOSE WITH THE LOWEST LEVELS. WE SAW A DIFFERENCE ABOUT SEVEN I Q. POINTS AND TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT TO THAT. THAT'S ABOUT WHAT WE SEE WITH LEAD POISONING KIDS WITH LEAD POISONING WE SEE ABOUT A SEVEN POINT DROP IN IQ ON AVERAGE. SO THIS IS A REAL CONCERN FOR US. OF COURSE IF IT IS A CONTROL GROUP THE CHEF OF THE THING AND- THE SECOND PART. YES THE NEXT QUESTION. OUR OUR STUDY POPULATION IS OFTEN THE SALINAS VALLEY THEY'RE ALL LIVING IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THEY ARE ALL LOW INCOME MOST ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS THAT WE HAVE IS A VERY HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION. BUT THEY BUT THEY ARE WHERE THEY DIFFER IS THEIR PESTICIDE LEVELS IN THEIR BODIES WE ALSO CONTROL FOR OTHER FACTORS LIKE MATERNAL IQ AT PARENTAL EDUCATION WE CONTROL FOR A BUNCH OF THINGS. SO BUT- THAT'S A EXCELLENT QUESTION- WE ALSO SEE IN THE SAME POPULATION THAT MOTHERS EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATE AND PREGNANCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH ADHD AUTISM LIKE BEHAVIORS AND EVEN DECREASED BRAIN ACTIVATION ON BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES AND THEIR KIDS- SO AT THIS POINT- THERE IS A VERY STRONG BODY OF LITERATURE FROM OUR STUDY AND ALSO FROM SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES. SHOWING ASSOCIATIONS ORGANIC PHOSPHATE PESTICIDES WITH DELAYS AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS CALIFORNIA PLANT BANNED CHLORPYRIFOS IN TWENTY NINETEEN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THE FEDERAL EPA BANDIT- BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THE CLIP PURPOSES JUST ONE OF AN ENTIRE CLASS OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES AND WE HAVEN'T BANNED THE OTHERS. AND THEY CAN STILL BE USED IN AGRICULTURE- EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE SOME OF THE SAME MANY OF THE SAME HEALTH CONCERNS- AS CLIPPERS HAS CLICK HERE FOR US. ON THE PLUS SIDE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE USE OF AGAIN A FAUCET PESTICIDES HAS DECREASED CONSIDERABLY- OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO- BUT- OVER THAT TIME. AGAIN OF FACETS OF BEEN REPLACED BY NEWER CLASSES OF PESTICIDES LIKE PYRETHROIDS THAT ARE LESS ACUTELY TOXIC TO HUMANS. BUT IT TAKES A WHILE FOR OUR RESEARCH TO CATCH UP SO WE'RE NOW STARTING TO SEE EVIDENCE THE PYRETHROIDS MAY ALSO HARM CHILDREN'S INNER DEVELOPMENT. IN IN OUR STUDY POPULATION WE SAW LOWER I CUES AND CHILDREN WHOSE MOTHERS LIVE CLOSE TO FIELDS WERE PYRETHROID PESTICIDES REPLIED DURING THE PREGNANCY. AND THERE IS OTHER RESEARCH THAT'S STARTING TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY THESE FINDINGS ALSO. I'M SO EVEN AS WE REPLACE ONE PESTICIDE CLASS WITH ANOTHER WE HAVE REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE NEW COMPOUNDS- OVER THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS OR SO WE'VE SEEN BROAD TRENDS AND PESTICIDE USE THE DDT OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND SIXTIES. WHICH WAS HIGHLY PERSISTENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT- AND ALMOST MADE A BALD EAGLES EXTINCT WAS REPLACED BY ORGANIC PHOSPHATES THE DIDN'T PERSIST IN THE ENVIRONMENT BUT WE'RE NEUROTOXIC TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS. AS AGAIN OF FACETS OF FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR WE'VE NOW SEEN THE RISE OF PYRETHROIDS AND NOW THE NEONICOTINOIDS ANOTHER OTHER PESTICIDES. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE THIRD REASON WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT PESTICIDE REGULATION. WHICH IS IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH NEONICOTINOIDS APPEAR TO HAVE FEWER HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS. THEY'RE VERY PERSISTENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY BUILD UP SYSTEMICALLY INSIDE PLANTS AND A VERY TOXIC TO INSECTS. MOST NOTABLY THE NITTANY OWNIK INSECTICIDES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CRASHES AND HONEY BEE AND OTHER PUBLIC POLLINATOR POPULATIONS. THEY ALSO GET INTO OUR STREAMS AND RIVERS. LEADING TO DECREASES IN THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES WHICH CAN THEN IMPACT FISH AND BIRD POPULATIONS THAT RELY ON THEM FOR FOOD. AND EVEN THOUGH WE THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFE FOR HUMANS WE ARE NOW STARTING TO HAVE CONCERNS. THAT THE NEW NEXT MAY ALSO IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH INCLUDING INCREASED RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS. THE HUMAN RESEARCH ON THE NEONICOTINOIDS IS STILL VERY NEW. AND WE'RE JUST STARTING TO LEARN THE FULL IMPLICATIONS- LASTLY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IN CASE YOU'RE NOT AWARE THAT A LOT OF THE BEST RESEARCH IN THE WORLD OF PESTICIDES IN THEIR IMPACTS- IS DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE RICH PESTICIDE USE REPORTING DATA THE TPR COLLECTS. IN CALIFORNIA WERE ABLE TO MAP ALL PESTICIDE USE DOWN TO THE SQUARE MILE AND WHEN IT WAS APPLIED WHICH IS A HUGE BECAUSE WE CAN'T LEARN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES. IF WE DON'T HAVE DATA ABOUT WHAT IS BEING USED IN WHERE IT'S BEING USED- SO. ADJUSTED TO SUM UP IM SH AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW REGULATING PESTICIDES IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING BALANCE OF PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND ECOSYSTEMS WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING AND PROTECTING. OUR VITAL AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY- AND I HOPE AS YOU TALK MORE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ABOUT HOW PESTICIDE REGULATIONS CONDUCTED IN CALIFORNIA. YOU ALSO TO CAN. CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT- INCLUDING PROTECTING THE BRAINS AND THE HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN THEIR LIVING NEAR FIELDS- THE FARMWORKERS WHO ARE PICKING UP FOOD. AND BIODIVERSITY IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR- INTERESTING TESTIMONY WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER ALI AWAY IT. IN THE STUDY IS THEIR DIVERSIFICATION BETWEEN THE APPLICATION OF THE PESTICIDE. FIRST LIKE SPRAY VERSUS PALLETIZED IN A WITH A LOT OF CROPS ESPECIALLY WITH CLLR FOR FOSTER. THEY'VE COMPLETELY GONE AWAY FROM THE SPRAY THEY JUST TO THE PALLETIZED THE DUDE THE SIGNAGE THEY DO THESE OTHER THINGS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE STAYING AWAY IN THAT IT ON THE GROUND SO THERE'S NOT AN AIR TRANSMISSION. QUALITY SO I JUST DOES THAT IS THERE DISTINCT VACATION WITH TAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW AGRICULTURE'S GONE A LONG WAY. TO GET AWAY FROM MANY THINGS SO THAT WAY IT IS SAFER YEAH NO I WOULD HAVE WOULD SAY THAT THAT THINGS HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH SINCE WE'VE SINCE WE STARTED THEIR STUDY. IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WHAT WE DO IS WE MEASURE THE LEVEL OF PESTICIDES INSIDE THEIR BODIES SO WE'RE TAKING URINE SAMPLES OR BLOOD SAMPLES WHERE WOMEN WERE WERE AND GEO CODING WHERE THEY LIVE RELATIVE TO THE FIELD. BUT BUT ONE OF THE MEASURE THE LEVELS INSIDE THE BODY WE CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL WAT YEAH IT FOUNDER AND VIDEO. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DISTINGUISHING. IF YOU'RE POPULATION BASE AND SAY THEY'RE DOING A SPRAY PROCESS. VERSES THE PALLETIZED PROCESS WITH THE NEWER PROCESS. NEEDS TO BE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT BECAUSE THIS REYES DEFINITELY GONNA CARRY WHICH IS WHY THEY SWITCHED OVER. TO THIS OF THE RESEARCH INDUSTRY FLAG THOSE CHANGES. IN I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT A WITHIN THE BODY'S WHAT'S IN THE HOME THAT THAT'S VITAL- ON. TO THOSE POPULATIONS EXPRESSLY. AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE THINGS BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALSO NOTING IF THE NEARBY PHARMACY BRAIN. VERSUS IF THIRD MOVEMENT TO THE PALLETIZED MODEL TO KEEP. THAT DRAFT THERE. FOR AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT REFER IF WE LOOK AT WHAT HOW BEING APPLY WHICH IS THAT REFLECT IN WHAT'S INTO THEIR HOMES AND SCATTERED ABOUT APPS BUT IT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE PRACTICE IN THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE CAN SHOW THE LEVELS OF GONE DOWN SINCE WE SWITCHED TO PALLETIZED THAT NEEDS TO BE NOTED AND I AGREE. VERY MUCH SO. YEAH I AGREE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BETTER. QUICK QUICK. QUESTION IN YOUR FIRST STATEMENT HE SAID THAT THEY FOUND PESTICIDES IT DID TOO. WE KNOW THESE PESTICIDES GET INTO PEOPLE'S BODIES AND THEY FOUND. IT ARE WE FOR. DO WE HAVE A CONTROL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE FARMWORKERS- THAT ARE. GETTING THE US VERSUS. PEOPLE ARE NOT FARMWORKERS ANISUR SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE IN ENGLAND A PESTICIDE. THE EASIEST WAY FOR US TO MAKE THAT COMPARISON. IS THAT WE NEED THESE BIOMARKERS OF. OF DIFFERENT PESTICIDES ARE ALSO MEASURED- NATIONALLY. SO THE CDC HAS A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE POPULATION IN THE ENHANCE HAND STUDY AND WHEN WE COMPARE WITH THE NATIONAL. POPULATION WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVELS. OF INNOCENT ISRAELI POPULATION. FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MATHIS WITH THAT OBVIOUSLY OUR CULTURE IN THE SALINAS VALLEY IS DIFFERENT SAY THAN IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN EVEN DIFFERENT BETWEEN EAST AND WEST NORTH AND SOUTH SO I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT OTHER CONTROL GROUPS SHE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. VERSES THE IMPERIAL VALLEY WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THOSE PRACTICES ARE VERY MUCH DIFFERENT AND I THINK. UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS. ESPECIALLY WITH THE DIFFERENT CROPS. OF COURSE DIFFERENT CROPS DO THINGS QUITE DIFFERENTLY- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA STRAWBERRIES VERSUS CITRUS- VERSUS PEPPERS. YOU KNOW SO I THINK GETTING MORE INTO THAT AS WELL- YOU KNOW SALINAS VALLEY'S IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT'S THE SALAD BOWL- BUT UNDERSTAND IT WHAT SAY HAPPENS IN THE CITRUS BELT YEAH BECAUSE FEAR PROCESS HOW IT TIES APPLICATIONS BEING DONE. IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE LEVELS ARE THERE- VERSUS SOMEWHERE THAT THAT IT HISTORICALLY SPRAYED IN NOW IS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT THOSE DISTINCTIONS ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT- IN GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US GOING FORWARD AS WE DECIDE WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE. I COMPLETELY AGREE AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE RESEARCH ON WHAT THE PESTICIDE MIX AND WHAT THE EXPOSURE LEVELS ARE LIKE AND HOW THAT DIFFERS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA. I THIS IS BEEN IT'S SUCH AN IN DEPTH EXTENSIVE STUDY OVER TWENTY YEARS OF MORE THAN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO CONDUCT IT AND IF WE COULD DO MORE RESEARCH LIKE THIS AND OTHER LOCATIONS. I THINK MY CONCERNS FIRST MISTER CHAIRMAN IS THAT IF WE JUST HONE IN ON THE SALINAS VALLEY. AND WE HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT IS VERY AND- BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE DIFFERENT AREAS ESPECIALLY AGRICULTURE ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT. DIFFERENT COMMODITIES THAT ARE BEING GROWN I MEAN THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY. DIFFERENT APPLICATION PROCESSES DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING- SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- TAKE THAT INTO CONCERNED. BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST SAY OKAY THIS. SALINAS VALLEY IS YOU KNOW MAYBE TWENTY OF THOSE FOR EXAMPLE NAY AMHERST ON TWENTY OTHERS A NUMBER. BUT WHEN YOU REALLY BREAK IT DOWN THEY'RE STILL FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHT DIFFERENT COMMODITY CROPS. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. AND SO THAT THAT'S A VAST DIFFERENCE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION I'M HEARING CUT DR HARLEY SAY IS- THAT WE HAVE SOME TOPLINE DATA THAT INDICATES THAT- HI THERE ARE IMPACTS ON- YOUNG CHILDREN THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WE NEED TO DRILL DOWN FURTHER TO UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW HOW THAT BREAKS DOWN OF IT FOR NOW OPERATES IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND IF I COULD JUST MENTION THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES BESIDES OUR STUDY THAT HAVE LOOKED MORE STATEWIDE LOOKING REALLY AT WHAT'S BEEN APPLIED AND CHILDREN LIVE NEARBY AND WE'RE SEEING SOME VERY SIMILAR FINDINGS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATE THAT Y. DATA IT'S NOT THE SAME. LEVEL OF DETAIL IS WHAT WE GET IN OUR SMALL POPULATION BUT IT'S SORT OF REPLICATED WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT A LOT MORE STATEWIDE POPULATION CORRECT WHICH IS. AGAIN WHY THE I THINK KNOWING THE APPLICATION PROCESS. IN THE DIFFERENT RECENT REGIONS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT THESE FAMILIES ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF IT IS VERY VITAL. FOR OUR IMMIGRANT AG FARM COMMUNITIES THAT THESE THINGS ARE BEING DONE BUT WE HAVE TO KNOW YOU KNOW HOW HOW ARE THEY DOING IT WHAT'S THE COMPARISON AND HAVE. THE CORRELATING DATA. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. VERY INTERESTING AND- I UNDERSTAND WE'RE JUST GETTING A SUMMARY TODAY BUT- APPRECIATED NONETHELESS. NEXT UP WE HAVE- OUR NEWLY APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF DPR JULIE HENDERSON. TOO MANY PEOPLE THE WORK OF DPR SEEMS SO VERY FAR REMOVED FROM THEIR DAILY LIVES BUT- THE REALITY IS THE PR'S PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS NOT ONLY IMPACT THE FOOD THAT WE EAT. BUT THE AIR THAT WE BREATHE. THE WATER WE DRINK. THE PRODUCTS WE USE IN OUR HOMES. AND MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES NO PRESSURE HENDERSON TO EXPLAIN TO US WHAT EXACTLY IT IS THAT THE P. R. DOES WHAT THE HECK IS IT THAT YOU DO- AND TO- HOW- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS ALIGNED WITH DVRS MISSION OF. HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE TRANSITION TO SAFER PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. ON THE SINCE A- DIRECTOR MORRISON. I EXCUSE ME SINCE- THE FOLLOWING WITNESS- KAREN MORRISON WILL DISCUSS DVRS FUNDING SOURCES AND HOW THOSE FUNDS SUPPORT THEIR PROGRAMS. MEMBERS MAY WISH TO HOLD THEIR QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER WE'VE HEARD FROM BOTH OF THESE WITNESSES AND WITH THAT OF A LOT WELCOME JULIE ANDERSON. THANK YOU SO MUCH- CHERRY BLOOM AND- GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS JULIE HENDERSON AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION I'VE BEEN IN THIS ROLE SINCE JULY OF LAST YEAR FIRST AS ACTING DIRECTOR AND THEN- AS OF DECEMBER APPOINTED DIRECTOR- BEFORE TAKING THIS ROLE I WAS A DEPUTY SECRETARY AND THERE ARE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS WITH THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT ON PRIORITY POLICY ISSUES IMPACTING BOTH DPR AND WE HA. AND AMONG THOSE- WERE AT SOME OF THE PRIORITIES THAT I SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MENTIONS THEY AT TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. AS WELL AS PESTICIDE APPLICATION NOTIFICATION- ONE OF THE FIRST PROJECTS I WORKED ON WHEN I CAME TO DPR TO CALLIE PA AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN- WAS THE DEPARTMENT'S REEVALUATION OF POOR PURIFY US BASED ON THE HUMAN HEALTH RISKS THAT DR HARLEY MENTIONED- AND AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED- DPR TOOK ACTION TO CANCEL. THE CORPORATE BUS REGISTRATION AND ALL OF THE USE OF CHLORPYRIFOS ON OR VIRTUALLY ALL OF IT ENDED AS OF THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. I'M REALLY EXCITED- TO BE IN THIS ROLE- BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE IN THE VISION- BUT THE NEW SEMESTER ADMINISTRATION AND SECRETARY. OF IDENTIFIED OF MOVING AWAY FROM HARMFUL PESTICIDES AND TOWARD SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. I THINK IT'S DR HARLEY MENTIONED- YOU CAN UNDERSTAND PESTICIDES ON A RISKY AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO TO TRY TO MOVE TO SAFER PRACTICES- THE BETTER WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT. I'M ALSO REALLY EXCITED TO BE IN THIS ROLE BECAUSE AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED IT REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF COLLABORATION AND- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DPR TEAM- WITH THE SECRETARY MY COLLEAGUES THAT KELLY PA. OUR SISTER AGENCIES- AND ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND OF COURSE YOU THE LEGISLATURE. AND TO REALLY SEE THAT VISION BECOME A ALITY. OUR MISSION AT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL IS REGULATING PESTICIDES- AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR USE IS SAFE ON BOTH FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN NOT IT'S ALSO FOSTERING THE USE OF SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES AND NOW WE REALLY HAVE TO ACCELERATE THAT TRANSITION. WE'RE COMMITTED IN BOTH OF THESE ROLES TO EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ON AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED. AND A KEY PART OF THAT IS ENGAGING MEANINGFULLY WITH COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES AND CONCERNS ABOUT PESTICIDE USE AND WORKING TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. A SECRETARY BLOOMFIELD LUNCHEON CALIFORNIA IS OFTEN SOUGHT OUT AS A LEADER IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH MATTERS AND WE SEEK THAT LEADERSHIP ROLE AS DPR BOTH AND ARE REGULATORY EFFORTS. AS WELL AS OUR EFFORTS TO MOVE TO SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED AND AS I NOTED THIS REQUIRES A LOT OF COLLABORATION ACROSS ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND IT'S NOT EASY WORK- BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT OF SO MANY OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE JOINED. THE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP AND ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A ROADMAP AND GOALS FOR GETTING US THERE. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATORY WALL AS IT STANDS TODAY. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT ROLE EVOLVES OVER TIME- AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT NEW SCIENCE AND SUCH AS BOTHERED DR HARLEY MENTIONED. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING UP WITH SCIENCE AND PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT. SO AS QUICK BACKGROUND- ON PESTICIDE REGULATION THE STATE PASSED ITS FIRST. PESTICIDE A LAW IN NINETEEN OH ONE AND UNTIL IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WAS RESPONSIBLE. FOR REGULATING PESTICIDES- DPR WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF CALLIE PA. FOLLOWING THE AGENCIES ESTABLISHMENT- BY GOVERNOR WILSON THAT SAME YEAR. SO THE WAY WE MANAGE POTS AFFECTS PUBLIC HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT- AS DR HURLEY NOTED PASS CAN INCLUDE AND SOCKS- ANIMALS LIKE INSECTS AND RODENTS UNWANTED PLANTS LIKE WEEDS. AND ALSO MICRO ORGANISMS LIKE PLANTS DISEASES AND VIRUSES THAT CAUSE DAMAGE ECONOMIC DAMAGE OR TRANSMIT DISEASE. THEY CAN BE MANAGED WITH CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL CULTURAL AND PHYSICAL TOOLS AND PRACTICES. I'M STATE AND FEDERAL LAW TO FIND PESTICIDES AND SUBSTANCES THAT ARE INTENDED TO CONTROL DESTROY REPEL OR ATTRACT PASS. AND ALTHOUGH WE OFTEN THINK OFAGRICULTURE WHEN WE THINK OF PESTICIDES- MANY COMMON HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS ARE ALSO PESTICIDES ON ANT SPRAY IS- MY STATE I. AM DISINFECTANTS ON PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED TO COLD MOLD AND MANY A LOT AND GOT HIM PER CARTON PRODUCTS AS WELL AS- SWIMMING POOL CHEMICALS. SO ACCELERATING THE USE OF SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES- REQUIRES CONSIDERING WHAT WE USE HOW WE USE AND WHEN WE USE THOSE TOOLS AND PRACTICES. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT IS AN ECOSYSTEM BASED STRATEGY THAT FOCUSES ON THE LONG TERM PREVENTION OF PAST. AND THEIR DAMAGE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF TECHNIQUES USING THE LEAST TOXIC EFFECTIVE METHOD. TO CONTROL PASSED TO MINIMIZE RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. DPR REGULATES THE USE OF PESTICIDES IN CALIFORNIA IN A REGULATORY PROGRAMS PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT WORK BEGINS WITH EVALUATING EVERY PESTICIDE BEFORE IT'S USED IN CALIFORNIA. ALL PESTICIDES USED IN THE US HAVE TO BE EVALUATED AND REGISTERED BY THE USEPA AND ALL PESTICIDES USED IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO BE EVALUATED AND REGISTERED IN THE STATE BEFORE USE. OUR REGISTRATION CONSIDER CONSIDERS CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC CONDITIONS LIKE WEATHER AND SOIL AND CAN OFTEN CONTAIN MORE SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS ARE MORE PROTECTIVE RESTRICTIONS ON THE U. S. EPA REGISTRATIONS. OUR SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION THAT PROCEEDS REST REGISTRATION AND ALSO CONTINUES AFTER REGISTRATION IS DRIVEN BY EMERGING SCIENCE AND IS AT THE CORE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S STRICT REGULATORY AND OVERSIGHT WORK. BEFORE MAKING A REGISTRATION DECISION DPR SCIENTISTS EVALUATE AND ASSESS PESTICIDES HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE RISKS CAN BE MITIGATED. WE WILL NOT REGISTER A PESTICIDE IF THERE'S RISKS CAN'T BE MITIGATED CAN INCLUDE DESIGNATING A PESTICIDE AS A RESTRICTED MATERIAL AS A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. AND ALSO LIMITS ON HOW THE PESTICIDE IS USED. THOSE RESTRICTED MATERIAL PERMITS- ARE VERY SPECIFIC WITH RESPECT TO TIME AND PLACE AND INCLUDE PRACTICES THAT REDUCE ADVERSE A FAX. LOCAL AYE COMMISSIONERS WHO GIVE THE PERMITS CAN ALSO DENY PERMITS AND ALSO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR USE BASED ON LOCAL CONDITIONS. THE DEPARTMENT CAN ALSO DESIGNATE PESTICIDES AS TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CONTROLS BASED ON THE USE OF THOSE PESTICIDES. IN ADDITION TO THOSE TWO FORMS OF RESTRICTION THE DEPARTMENT MAY ALSO APPLY RESTRICTIONS TO OTHER PESTICIDES LIMITING THEIR USE. AS I MENTIONED ONCE WE REGISTER A PESTICIDE THAT IS NOT THE END OF OUR EVALUATION WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ALL PESTICIDES FOLLOWING THAT REGISTRATION TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EMERGING SCIENCE WHICH AS YOU CAN TELL FROM DOCTOR HARLEY'S PRESENTATION IS REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE THE SCIENCE OF FALLS IN CHANGES. WE REGULARLY MONITOR AIR SURFACE WATER SOURCES LIKE CREEKS AND GROUNDWATER WELLS FOR THE PRESENCE OF PESTICIDES AND TAKE ACTION TO RESTRICT USE WHERE PESTICIDE LEVELS EXCEED THOSE THAT ARE DEFINED BY HEALTH STANDARDS. OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WE'VE OPERATED AIR MONITORING STATIONS AND MORE THAN TWO DOZEN COUNTIES. EVALUATED SURFACE WATER AND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY LOCATIONS AND SAMPLED OVER FOUR THOUSAND UNIQUE WELLS. THE DEPARTMENT'S AIR MONITORING NETWORK WHICH ALLOWS US TO MEASURE EXPOSURE FROM THIRTY ONE DIFFERENT PESTICIDES HAS LED TO INCREASED RESTRICTIONS INCLUDING THE USE OF TARPS FOR FUMIGANT APPLICATIONS TO REDUCE PESTICIDE EXPOSURES. ARE WELL MONITORING HAS RESULTED IN THE DESIGNATION OF A NUMBER OF PESTICIDES AS RESTRICTED MATERIALS. WE ALSO TRACK PESTICIDE USE ILLNESS AND INJURY REPORTS ADVERSE EFFECTS REPORTS AND NEW SCIENTIFIC STUDIES DATA AND FINDINGS FROM RESEARCHERS OTHER AGENCIES AND NGOS. IF WE IDENTIFY RISKS DURING THOSE EVALUATIONS WE CONSIDER POTENTIAL MEDICATION OPTIONS THOSE INCLUDE AS THEY DO WITH THE REGISTRATION STAGE. DESIGNATING PESTICIDES AS WERE TO RESTRICT MATERIALS OR TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS REQUIRING YOU USE CONDITIONS WERE CANCELING THE PRODUCT AS WE DID IN THE CASE OF CORPORATE BOSS. RE CONTINUOUS EVALUATION- RECENTLY LED TO- FORMAL REEVALUATION OF THE ADVOCATES MY PESTICIDES AS SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MENTIONED. THAT FOLLOWED A SERIES OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT NEONICOTINOIDS CAN CAUSE HARM TO POLLINATORS. LAST MONTH WE PROPOSE REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS NEONICOTINOID RISKS TO PESTICIDE TO POLLINATORS. THIS COMPREHENSIVE REGULATIONS FOLLOW AND NUANCED TIERED APPROACH TO LIMITING AGRICULTURAL SETTINGS. TO LIMITING USE IN AGRICULTURAL SETTINGS. BASED ON PROPER TRACKED ADMITS TO BE IS. OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE DEPARTMENT EVALUATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS AND EFFORTS TO FOSTER REDUCE PRESS PEST MANAGEMENT HAVE HELPED LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS AND PESTICIDE USE. INCLUDING ORGANIC PHOSPHATE PESTICIDES LIKE CHLORPYRIFOS HAVE DECREASED BY SEVENTY NINE PERCENT. GROUNDWATER CONTAMINANTS HAVE DECREASED BY AND BIRTH DEFECTS HAVE DECREASED BY SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. AND ON THE SAFER SIDE ALTERNATIVE BIO PESTICIDE USE HAS INCREASED BY SEVEN HUNDRED AND 20% IN ADDITION TO EVALUATING AND REGULATING PESTICIDES WE ALSO HAVE A KEEN FOCUS ON WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WELL AS COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SAFETY. DPR WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS PROTECT WORKERS WHO HANDLE OR WORK NEAR PESTICIDES FROM POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS EXPOSURES. THE STATE'S COMPREHENSIVE STATE WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS HELPED SHAPE THE FEDERAL WORKER SAFETY PROTECTION STANDARDS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE NATIONALLY IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. WE PARTICIPATE REGULARLY AN OUTREACH AND EDUCATION EVENTS TO PROVIDE SAFETY INFORMATION TO PESTICIDE HANDLERS AND FIELD WORKERS. THIS OUTREACH SUPPORTS PESTICIDE SAFETY TRAINING THAT EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO DEVELOPED AN ELECTRONIC REPORTING TOOL WHICH WE CALL CASPER CALIFORNIA SYSTEM FOR PESTICIDE INCIDENT REPORTING. TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO REPORT PESTICIDE INCIDENTS AND HONESTLY ON THEIR PHONES. SINCE THE DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHMENT THE NUMBER OF REPORTED PESTICIDE ILLNESSES AMONG WORKERS HANDLING PESTICIDES FOR AGRICULTURAL USE AND STRUCTURAL PEST CONTROL HAS DECREASED BY 87% IN ADDITION TO OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES THE DEPARTMENT ALSO CONDUCTS COMMUNITY OUTREACH TO PROMOTE BROADER PESTICIDE SAFETY OVER THE PAST DOZEN YEARS WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND COMMUNITY EVENTS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PESTICIDE REGULATIONS AND PESTICIDE SAFETY. WE'VE ALSO BROADCAST MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON SPANISH AND INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE RADIO STATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE PESTICIDE SAFETY INFORMATION. INCREASING ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT PESTICIDE APPLICATIONSAND IMPROVING COMMUTING GAUGE RENT ARE CRITICAL TO THE PARCHMENTS MISSION OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. THE SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MENTIONED HOW WE RECEIVE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE PESTICIDE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM TO PROVIDE COMMUNITIES WITH ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS HAPPENING NEAR THEM. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THAT STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT WILL ENABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO TAKE SIMPLE PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT THEIR HEALTH. LIKE BRINGING CHILDREN INDOORS STAYING AWAY FROM FIELDS CLOSING WINDOWS SPRINGING IN LAUNDRY AND TOYS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS AND HAVE BEEN GATHERING FEEDBACK ON THE DESIGN OF THAT SYSTEM AND PLAN TO HOLD A WORKSHOP LATER THIS SPRING. LAST MONTH AT FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS ANNOUNCED PILOTS AND COUNTY LOCATIONS- TO PILOT NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS THAT WILL PROVIDE INPUT INTO THE DESIGN OF OUR STATEWIDE SYSTEM. THOSE LOCAL PILOT PROJECTS- WILL LAUNCH OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS AND IN FACT ONE WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK- IN RIVERSIDE- THE OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED IN SANTA CRUZ STANISLAUS AND VENTURA COUNTIES OTHERS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THEIR LOCAL I. COMMISSIONERS HE WILL THEN PROVIDE THAT FEEDBACK TO US TO HELP US WITH THE DESIGN OF OUR STATEWIDE SYSTEM. OUR COMMUNITY FOCUS ALSO INCLUDES CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS. AS DR HURLING NOTED CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO IMPACTS OF PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AND ARE FOR THAT REASON A SPECIFIC FOCUS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. WE OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATIONS THAT PROVIDE MINIMUMDISTANCE STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS NEAR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND ALSO CHILD CARE CENTERS. AND THEY REQUIRE ANNUAL REPORTING OF ANTICIPATED PESTICIDE APPLICATION AROUND THE SITES. OUR CURRENT PESTICIDE REPORTING REGULATIONS DON'T PROVIDE THE FINE LEVEL OF DETAIL TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY TRACK COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE HAVE PROVIDED GUIDANCE. TO AG COMMISSIONERS TO PROVIDE TO GROWERS TIP MORE REFINED THEIR REPORTING SO THAT WE CAN BETTER TRACK COMPLIANCE AND WE'RE ALSO CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THAT WOULD HELP REFINE REPORTING AND ALSO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE TRACKING. SIR SHIFTING TO- PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS AS IT RELATES TO FOOD RESIDUES- THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS THE NATION'S LARGEST PESTICIDE RESIDUE MONITORING PROGRAM OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PRODUCE. WE CONDUCT INSPECTIONS AT SUPERMARKETS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND FARMERS MARKETS ACROSS THE STATE AND CONTRACT WITH CDFA IS A LOB TO ANALYZE THE SAMPLES. WE ALSO INSPECT STORES THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR UNREGISTERED PRODUCTS SALES AND ALSO TRACK INTERNET SALES OF PESTICIDES NOT REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA. EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE STATE'S PESTICIDE USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS OF COURSE ESSENTIAL I'M TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR REGULATORY PROGRAMS. THAT ENFORCEMENT DUTY IS SHARED BETWEEN DPR AND THE LOCAL COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS. WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR STATE WHAT ENFORCEMENT AND THE OVERSIGHT OF OUR STATEWIDE PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THE LOCAL PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS. COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR STAFF OF APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED INSPECTORS AND BIOLOGISTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE STATE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. THEY PROMOTE COMPLIANCE WITH PESTICIDE USE LAWS REGULATION THROUGHOUT REGION EDUCATION AND NEARLY ALL AND CONDUCT NEARLY ALL OF THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AGAINST PESTICIDE USE VIOLATIONS. WE PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE AYE COMMISSIONER I THROUGH THEIR ACTIVITIES THROUGH OUR WORK PLANS THAT WE WORK WITH ON THEM. OVERSIGHT INSPECTIONS TRAINING FOR REGULATION IMPLEMENTATION RESTRICTED MATERIAL PERMITTING. INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS WE ALSO MEET AND ENGAGE REGULATE WHETHER AYE COMMISSIONER PARTNERS. THEIR LOCAL ON THE GROUND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE PESTICIDE USE LAWS IN THE STATE AND KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. DPR AND AYE COMMISSIONERS INVESTIGATE PESTICIDE RELATED COMPLAINTS AND THE COMMISSIONERS CONDUCT INSPECTIONS TO ENSURE ALL PESTICIDE APPLICATORS COMPLY WITH PESTICIDE PRODUCT REGISTRATION AND LABELING REQUIREMENTS. ON AVERAGE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS COMMISSIONERS HAVE CONDUCTED OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ANNUAL INSPECTIONS. WE HAVE A AYE COMMISSIONERS ARE JOINTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL PESTICIDE RELATED ILLNESSES OR INJURIES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY PESTICIDE DRAFTS EXPOSURE OR EXCEEDING PESTICIDE CONCENTRATIONS IN AIR. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AYE COMMISSIONERS HAVE CONDUCTED AN AVERAGE OF OVER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED ANNUAL INVESTIGATIONS. AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING LATER THIS MONTH ABOUT OUR ENFORCEMENT BUDGET REQUEST- BUT I WANTED TO GET JUST A QUICK PREVIEW OF OUR REQUEST- WELL LOCAL I. COMMISSIONER ENFORCEMENT A PESTICIDE VIOLATIONS IS APPROPRIATE AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS INCLUDING MULTI JURISDICTIONAL VIOLATIONS PROGRESSIVE STATE LEVEL ENFORCEMENT IS APPROPRIATE. WE'RE PROPOSING CHANGES TO OUR ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO RESTORE THE AUTHORITY THAT SUNSET IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND ARE ALSO PROPOSING INCREASES AND CRIMINAL CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FINE LEVELS AN INCREASE FUNDING FOR STATE LEVEL ENFORCEMENT. FINALS FOR PESTICIDE USE VIOLATIONS HAVE REMAINED LARGELY UNCHANGED FOR DECADES AND NEED TO BE MODERNIZED TO EFFECTIVELY DETER VIOLATIONS. AND ACCOUNT FOR YEARS OF INFLATION AND KEEP PACE WITH FEDERAL PESTICIDE ENFORCEMENT PENALTIES. AS AN EXAMPLE I RECALL CHAU COMMISSIONERS FOUND AN AERIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATOR ADMINISTRATIVELY LIABLE FOR PESTICIDE USE VIOLATIONS INCLUDING DRIPPED ONTO A SOCCER FIELD AND LEVY PENALTIES ON NINE SEPARATE OCCASIONS IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES. HIGHER FINES FOR EARLIER VIOLATIONS MAY HAVE SERVED AS A BETTER DETERRENT. REPEAT VIOLATIONS LIKE THIS REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT TOOLS AND ADDITIONAL PENALTIES TO DETERMINES CONDUCT. ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND INCREASE PENALTIES WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S LICENSING VIOLATION ACTIVITIES. DPR REQUIRES TRAINING PROFESSIONAL LICENSES AND CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR COMMERCIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATORS WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN THIRTY THOUSAND LICENSES AND PROVIDE TRAINING MATERIALS TO OVER TEN THOUSAND FOR OVER TEN THOUSAND ANNUAL EXAMS AND THIRTY TWO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES COVERING PESTICIDE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF PESTICIDES AN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT. THIS TRAINING EXAMINATION AND LICENSING PROCESS PROMOTES PROFESSIONAL AND SAFE PEST CONTROL CONDUCTED BY QUALIFIED AND RESPONSIBLE LICENSEES. DPR ALSO CERTIFIED PESTICIDE APPLICATORS WHO USE OR SUPERVISE THE USE OF RESEARCH MATERIAL PESTICIDES AND ALSO LICENSES BUSINESSES THAT SELL OR APPLY PESTICIDES OR USE PEST CONTROL METHODS OR DEVICES FOR HIGHER. OVER THE PAST SEVENTEEN YEARS WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN OVER LICENSES THAT WE ISSUED WITHOUT INCREASING FEES OR ADDING STOPPING TO ACCOMMODATE THE RELATED INCREASE IN WORKLOAD. WE'RE REQUESTING FUNDING THIS YEAR TO COMPLY WITH NEW FEDERAL CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND TO ADD STOPPING SO THAT WE CAN TIMELY RENEW LICENSES. AND PROVIDE GREATER LANGUAGE ACCESS AND VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION TEN EWING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. I'M GOING TO SHIP NOW FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATORY ROLE TO ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN FOSTERING AND NOW ACCELERATING THE USE OF REDUCED RISK PESTICIDES. AND MORE SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE BEST PRACTICES. WE'VE CARRIED OUT OUR ROLE TO DATE AND SUPPORTING AND FOSTERING THE USE OF REDUCE RESPONSE MANAGEMENT BY PROMOTING THE USE OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BUT USE THE LEAST TOXIC. EFFECTIVE METHODS TO CONTROL PEST PROBLEMS. OUR DEDICATED INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT BRANCH ADMINISTERS INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT RESEARCH GRANTS THAT INCENTIVIZE INNOVATION. IN OUR REGION EDUCATION GRANTS. THAT HELP TO PROMOTE THE USE UP AND EXPAND THE USE OF IBM ADOPTION. WITH THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THOSE GRANTS HAVE TOTALED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS PROMOTE I PM LEADERSHIP THROUGHOUT THE STATE. JUST LAST MONTH WE CELEBRATED OUR ANNUAL IPM ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS WHICH RECOGNIZE ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT USE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSE PEST MANAGEMENT NEEDS IN AGRICULTURE AND NON AGRICULTURAL SETTINGS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ONE OF OUR AWARDS WENT TO THE IPM PROGRAM AT ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND SCHOOLS. THE DISTRICT'S PROGRAM FOCUSED ON AND I GET INNOVATIVE NON CHEMICAL TOOLS SUCH AS RAFTER PERCHES THAT ATTRACT RAPTORS TO CONTROL RODENTS. THE DISTRICTS IPM PROGRAM ELIMINATED THE USE OF RODENTICIDES AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE USE OF INSECTICIDES ACROSS TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT SCHOOL SITES. LAST YEAR WE CELEBRATED MICHAEL BY ASKEY A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER REBECCA BAUER K. HANDS DISTRICT WITH THE DISTRICTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S FIRST LIFETIME IPM ACHIEVEMENT AWARD WE RECOGNIZED HIS CAREER LONG ADVOCACY AND EDUCATION BY PM PRACTICES. AND IS EXPANSION OF IBM RESEARCH IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. ACCELERATING A SYSTEM WIDE STATE WIDE TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. REQUIRES MORE THOUGH WE NEED BROADER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND COMMITMENT AND AMBITIOUS TARGETED GOALS SO SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MENTIONED IN HIS REMARKS WE IN CFA CONVENE THE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP. TO IDENTIFY PATHWAYS AND TO SET TARGETED MEASURABLE AMBITIOUS GOALS TO HELP GET US TO THAT PLACE. THE WORK GROUP INCLUDES TWENTY SIX MEMBERS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING DR HARLEY- AS WELL AS GROWERS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES ACROSS THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. ADDITIONAL UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES AND COMMUNITY AND TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES WHO BRING BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL JUSTICE AND FARMWORKER PERSPECTIVES. WE EXPECT THE WORKGROUP TO ISSUE ITS DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS AND PATHWAYS ANGLES LATER THIS SPRING. AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER COORDINATION ACROSS STATE AGENCIES IS REALLY CRITICAL TO OUR WORK- THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM THE USE OF PESTICIDE REQUIRES DEDICATED COLLABORATION WE ROUTINELY COORDINATE WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO ENSURE CONSISTENT AND COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH TO PESTICIDE REGULATION. AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL KEY STATE PARTNERSHIPS AND EXAMPLES OF JUST SOME OF A COLLABORATIVE WORK. OUR AIR MONITORING PROGRAM STAFF WORK WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON STUDIES TO MEASURE PESTICIDE AIR CONCENTRATIONS. WE ALSO ARE PARTNERING WITH CARB ON A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN TO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TOOK ADDRESS PESTICIDE EXPOSURE RELATED CONCERNS. THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT PROVIDES REVIEW CONSULTATION AND COMMENTS ON THE DEPARTMENT'S EVALUATION OF THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. AND WE ALSO COORDINATE WITH THE WE HA AND WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS INCLUDING THE MEDICAL SUPERVISION PROGRAM WHICH PROTECTS AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHO REGULARLY HANDLE HIGHLY TOXIC PESTICIDES. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ON OUR WELL SAMPLING WORK. AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS AND MUNICIPALITIES ON A STATEWIDE EFFORT TO GENERATE DATA ON PESTICIDES AND URBAN RUNOFF AND WATER WAYS TO SUPPORT FUTURE MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. WE COORDINATE AND DANGEROUS SPECIES ACTS PROTECTION STRATEGIES WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE CULTURE AS WELL AS WITH AG COMMISSIONERS. IN ADDITION TO ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTION WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ON OUR PESTICIDE USE MITIGATION EFFORTS AND AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE KEY PARTNERS IN CONVENING THE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP. OUR WORK PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT IS SUPPORTED BY THE CONDITION OF OUR FUNDING SOURCES. AND SO I'D NOW LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR ACTING CHIEF DEPUTY CARE MORRISON. TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES THAT HELP US CARRY OUT OUR MISSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WELCOME DOCTOR MORRISON. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAPLAIN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY MY NAME IS KAREN MORRISON. AND I'M ACTING CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT TPR. DR HENDERSON PROVIDED A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENTS WORK TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY. ADDRESS PASS PRESSURES. AND I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW WE FUNDS THIS WORK. OUR CURRENT YEAR BUDGET IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WITH THIS WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT CRITICAL WORK OF FOUR HUNDRED STAFF ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE TWO LOCATIONS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA ONE IN FRESNO COUNTY AND ONE IN ORANGE COUNTY. AS WELL SUPPORTING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS. DEPARTMENT'S CORE SOURCES OF ON GOING FUNDING COME FROM THREE MAIN FUNDS THE MELISSA SPENT OUR PESTICIDE REGISTRATION FEES AND OUR LICENSING FEES. AS WELL AS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS AND FEDERAL FUNDS ALL OF THESE TOGETHER ARE MANAGED WITHIN OUR DPR FUNDS. IN RECENT YEARS DPR IS ALSO SEEN AN INCREASE IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. APPROPRIATIONS TO HELP SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND TOOLS AND OTHER EMERGING PROBLEM PROJECTS FOR THE DEPARTMENTS. AS IS THE MENTION THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT IS OUR MILITIAS WHICH PROVIDES 75% OF THE REVENUE IN THE DPR FUND AND SUPPORTS A BROAD RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS. THE MILLER SAYS MAN IS LEVIED ON THE SALE OF ALL PESTICIDES BOTH AGRICULTURAL AND NON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AT THE FIRST POINT OF SALE IN CALIFORNIA AND IS CURRENTLY SET AT TWENTY ONE MILLS. AND THEY'LL IS EQUIVALENT TO ONE TENTH OF ONE SENSE AND SO IN PRACTICE FOR EVERY HUNDRED DOLLARS OF PESTICIDE SALES WE COLLECT TWO DOLLARS AND TEN CENTS OF REVENUE FOR THE DEPARTMENT. CANNELLA ASSESSMENT WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE TO CREATE AN INDUSTRY SUPPORTED FEE STRUCTURE. THAT WOULD FUND THE ACTIVITIES OF A GROWING PESTICIDE REGULATORY PROGRAM. THIS WAS SIMILAR TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM FUNDING STRUCTURES. THE MILLISECOND STATUTE AND WAS LAST ADJUSTED EP IN TWO THOUSAND FORWARD TO INCREASE THE CAP THE MELISSA SMITH FROM SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE. TO TWENTY ONE MILLS. OF THE TWENTY ONE MILLS COLLECTED DVRS I'M ALLOCATE TO THE STATUTORILY SET. SEVEN POINT SIX MILLS TO THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS TO CARRY OUT AND ENFORCE PESTICIDE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. LAST YEAR AT THIS AMOUNTED TO THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO THE COMMISSIONERS OF BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF PESTICIDES APPLIED IN THE COUNTY THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED MATERIAL PERMITS ISSUED AND OTHER RELATED WORK. HOWEVER THE PROVIDED MELISSA SMITH IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO FULLY REIMBURSE THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS WORK AROUND PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT SUPPORTING LESS THAN HALF OF THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS. THE REMAINING FUNDING FOR THE LOCAL PROGRAMS COMES FROM A VARIETY OF OTHER FUNDS THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT ARE COUNTY GENERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS UNCLEAN GAS TAX THAT'S APPROPRIATED TO THE COUNTY IS. THERE ALSO SUPPORTED BY COMMISSIONER IMPOSED FEES AND PENALTIES AS WELL AS MISCELLANEOUS PAYMENTS FROM DPR TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY ONE MELISSA CEMENTS THAT SUPPORTS CPR'S PROGRAMS AND THE WORK BY THE COMMISSIONERS A SEPARATE THREE QUARTER MILLIGAUSS MINTS ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS SUPPORTS PESTICIDE RELATED PROGRAMS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AG. DIMENSIONAL LEVEL OF THE ASSESSMENT HAS REMAINED THE SAME FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS AND FOR THE FIRST TEN OR SO YEARS DPR COLLECTED ENOUGH REVENUE FROM THE MILLICENT TO SUPPORT ITS PROGRAMS. BEGINNING IN TWENTY THIRTEEN DPR IS FUNDED MOVED INTO A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE MEANING THAT WE WERE EXPENDING MORE AT THE END OF THE REVENUES THAT WE WERE COLLECTING. SEVERAL FACTORS LED TO THE COST PRESSURES THAT HAVE BEEN FACED BY DPR AND THESE INCLUDE ONGOING EXPANSION IN THE SCOPE OF PROGRAMS FOR AT THE DEPARTMENTS. AND IN SOME CASES THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN STAFFING LEVELS TO KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGING IN INCREASING DEMANDS ON CPR. WE AND MANY OTHERS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ALSO SEEN AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE SUPPORTED OUT OF OUR FUNDS. WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION THREE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE TO PAY DOWN A SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT LOAN OF APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE GENERAL FUND. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A POSITIVE FUND BALANCE INAPPROPRIATE RESERVE DPR REDUCE ITSEXPENDITURES IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY ON A ONE TIME BASIS BY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS PROMPTED CLOSE CONSIDERATION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET SITUATION AND AS A RESULT LAST YEAR TPR PROPOSED INCREASING AND CHANGING ITS MELISSA SMITH STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE DEPARTMENT STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. AS WELL AS TO INCENTIVIZE SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. OF THAT PROPOSAL DID NOT GO THROUGH AS A PART OF BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS DPR RECEIVED ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO CONDUCT THE STUDY WITH THE HELP OF AN OUTSIDE VENDOR. TO IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE SOURCES AND LEVELS OF FUNDING THAT WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE TO FILL ITS MISSION AND VISION. THE STUDY WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE CURRENT AND FUTURE FUNDING NEEDS THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH AND ENFORCEMENT OF PESTICIDE LAWS. AND REGULATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. THE GOALS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO IDENTIFY HOW TO SUSTAINABLY SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA'S PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IS KEY TO THIS PROCESS AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS YOU AND YOUR STAFF AT LEAST AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE CITY PROCESS. CONSIDERING OUR CURRENT BUDGET DPR IS FUN BALLOTS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A PRUDENT RESERVE IN LINE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES GUIDANCE OF 325% OF OUR OPERATING BUDGET. THIS IS IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE INCREASED MIL REVENUE FROM LAST YEAR. A MAJORITY OF WHICH WE ASSOCIATE WITH THE INCREASE IN SALES OF DISINFECTANTS AS A RESULT OF THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. TO GET PUT SOME NUMBERS TO THAT WE COLLECTED TEN MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAN WE HAD IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. I'M AWARE IS ARE MORE TYPICAL YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES ONE TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS. HOWEVER AT THIS TIME WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT TO CONSIDER THIS FUNDING SUSTAINABLE OR TO COUNT ON THIS LEVEL- TO MAINTAIN IN FUTURE YEARS AND TO ADDRESS THE IMBALANCE. IF THE LEVEL OF THE ASSESSMENT IS NOT CHANGE IT IS LIKELY THE FUND BALANCE WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE TO THE POINT. WHERE SUPPORT FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES IS SEVERELY COMPROMISED AND SO WE'RE LOOKING TO THE SMALL STUDY. TO REALLY PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S TRANSITION. TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. DPR IS TO OTHER DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC FUNDING SOURCES ARE FEE BASED REVENUES THAT SUPPORT THE PARENTS REGISTRATION AND LICENSING PROGRAMS. THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THESE FEES THROUGH REGULATION IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. FIRST IS THE PESTICIDE REGISTRATION FEES WHICH ACCOUNTS 416% OF THE REVENUE COLLECTED IN THE DPR FUNDS. AND SUPPORTS PESTICIDE PRODUCT EVALUATION AND REGISTRATION- WE RAISED THIS FEE IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL PROGRAM MANY OF THE COST PRESSURES I MENTIONED EARLIER ALSO APPLIED TO THIS PORTION OF OUR FUNDING. AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA PESTICIDE ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION TRACKING SYSTEM OR CAL PASSED ON THIS IS A NEW SYSTEM TO ALLOW US TO STREAMLINE OUR PAPER BASED REGISTRATION SYSTEM WHILE MAINTAINING OUR RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION PROCESS TO SUPPORT THE INNOVATION OF SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS. AS WELL AS A DECREASE REGISTRATION TIMELINES- AND WE'RE KICKING OFF DEVELOPMENTS AS WE SPEAK AND ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. OUR LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION FEES ACCOUNT 42% OF THE REVENUE COLLECTED IN THE DPR FUND. AGAIN THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON THE EXAMINATION AND LICENSING FOR THOSE WHO SELL APPLY COMMERCIALLY OR CONSULT ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES. WE ARE ALSO CONSIDERING THE FEE INCREASE FOR THIS PROGRAM IN THREE YEARS PENDING APPROVAL OF THE P. C. P. THAT'S UP FOR CONSIDERATION THIS YEAR. THE REMAINING SOURCES OF ONGOING FUNDING FOR DPR ARE A MIXTURE OF OTHER REGULATORY FEES MANAGED BY OTHER ENTITIES. THIS INCLUDES A CANNABIS TAX FUND ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND AS WELL AS PENALTIES A SMALL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND COLLECTIVELY THESE ACCOUNT 47% OF OUR DPR FUNDS. THEY MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE IN RECENT YEARS RECEIVED MORE SUPPORT FROM ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS- OF THE BIGGEST OF WHICH OF THESE CAME IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. WHERE WE WERE ALLOCATED OR WHERE THIRTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED OVER TWO YEARS TO SUPPORT ONE TIME INVESTMENT THAT DPR. CDFA UC AND CSU TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION TOWARD SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE TOOLS AND PRACTICES. WHICH IS A TREMENDOUS PRIORITY FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION. RESOURCES RECEIVED FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR HAVE AUGMENTED GRANT FUNDING FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE EXPLORING PESTICIDE ALTERNATIVES AND SUPPORTING THEIR BROADER ADOPTION THROUGHOUT REGION EDUCATION. AND THE ONE TIME FUNDS OF ALSO PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DPR TO ENHANCE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING ACTIVITIES AND CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES GENERAL SUPPORT HAVE GONE TOWARD THE NOTIFICATION WORK THAT DIRECTOR HENDERSON MENTIONING HER REMARKS AS WELL AS SUPPORTING THE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP PROVIDE GOALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THIS TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. AND REALLY TOGETHER ALL OF THESE FUNDING SOURCES ARE ALLOWING US IN THE SHORT TERM TO BUILD ON OUR CORE REGULATORY WORK AS WELL AS TO REALLY MOVE THE DEPARTMENT TOWARD ITS VISION FOR THE FUTURE. SO THAT I'LL HAND IT BACK TO DIRECTOR HENDERSON FOR QUICK CLOSE AND THEN HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- AND THANK YOU ALL- I THINK HOPEFULLY YOU ARE TAKING AWAY- FROM OUR PRESENTATIONS THAT. THE MOVE TO A SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IS REALLY CRITICAL TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS OUR ENVIRONMENT- BUT IT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT- IN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ENFORCEMENT. AS WELL AS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN OUR MISSION AND OUR WORK- AND ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE- PRETTY DETAILED TEST SUMMARY OF ALL THE IMPORTANT TO- WORK THAT YOU DO AND- FISCAL UNDER PENDING SEC- THAT TO HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE- CHAIR OF- THE- BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES ALL OF THE SIDE BEEN WELL AWARE FOR QUITE SOMETIME THAT THEIR- STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND- HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT OF THIS YEAR- WILL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS NOW AND I'VE GOT A- A COUPLE OF KICKED THINGS OFF WITH ONE. OF IS A QUESTION THAT- THAT- CHAIR- QUIRK TEXTED ME AND ASKED- THAT I- I ASKED THE QUESTION OF A- DR. HARLEY BUT I'LL PARAPHRASE THAT- AND- DIRECTOR PERHAPS- YOU CAN- GIVE US SOME INSIGHT- DOCTOR COURT CUT- OBSERVES THAT TO- ALL OF THE ORGANIC FAST PHOSPHATES HAVE THE SAME CHEMISTRY AS A CORPORATE. PLUS AND WE'VE ONLY ELIMINATED- THAT TO- ONE- THAT- PRODUCT. DO WE HAVE PLANS TO GO BEYOND THAT OR IS THERE INVESTIGATORY WORK THAT'S SAID THAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU IN AND I WILL- I'LL TAKE- THE FIRST STAB AT THAT ANSWER AND THEN- I WILL ENGAGE DOCTOR MORRISON WHO IS A SCIENTIST. TO HELP OUT WITH THE RESPONSE BUT AS I MENTIONED- I SHOULD START BY SAYING WE HAVE THE GREATEST CONCERN- FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND RECOGNIZE- THE DANGEROUS EFFECTS OF ORGANIC PHOSPHATES. ON THEIR HEALTH- WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE NEW SCIENCE AND STUDIES THAT COME OUT- THAT IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL RISKS AND HARMS. FOR ALL PESTICIDE PRODUCTS INCLUDING ORGANIC PHOSPHATES- AND AT ANY ONE TIME WILL WILL HAVE A NUMBER OF PESTICIDES AND REEVALUATION- BUT ALSO TURNED OVER TO KAREN TO TALK ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC- ORGANIC PHOSPHATE RELATED- EVALUATIONS. YES THANK YOU IT SAID DR GRACE IS A VERY FAIR POINT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAPPING CHEMISTRY IS WITHIN THE ORGANIC PHOSPHATE CLASS AND SO WE LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF THAT USE RECORDS THAT WE HAVE WHICH ARE SHOWING AN OVERALL DECREASE IN USE OF THOSE PRODUCTS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. AS WE'RE CONSIDERING OUR EVALUATIONS- AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TOWARD AND AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE ACTION CORPORATE BOSS ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT WE HEARD WAS A DESIRE TO REALLY THINK. HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THE SYSTEM AND WHAT TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE AND SO I'M ARE ANTICIPATING THAT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE SAMPLE PEST MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP AND OTHER PLACES ARE GONNA BE HELPFUL AS WERE THINKING HOLISTICALLY ABOUT WHAT TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO MANAGE AND SEX AND HOW THAT FITS IN WITH THE RISKS IDENTIFIED. FORGET ABOUT STATES. GREAT THANK YOU- NOW- BURKE EVERYONE OF OUR WITNESSES TODAY INCLUDING YOURSELF HAVE MENTIONED. A FOCUS ON CHILDREN WHICH I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE- IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- A DOCTOR HARLEY- SPOKE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT- THE IMPACT ON. BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU ARE DEFINING THE CATEGORY OF CHILDREN WHAT AGES- ARE YOU ACTIVELY LOOKING AT- UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A- LARGE. BODY OF RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE THAT- BRAIN DEVELOPMENT- DOESN'T END WITH CHILDHOOD IT CONTINUES ON INTO. ADOLESCENCE AND EARLY ADULTHOOD OVER TO KAREN I THINK I JUST AGAIN GOING BACK. AND LOOKING OUT ON THE PROCESS OF CONTINUOUS EVALUATION SO WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AND I AM LOOKING NOT JUST ON CHILDREN BUT AS YOU MENTIONED- SHARPLY ON THE AFFECTS OF- OF ON ON BRAIN HEALTH OF ADULTS AS WELL- SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THAT THOSE. ALL SENSITIVE POPULATIONS ARE PART OF- OUR REVIEW- BUT ALL TURNED OVER TO DOCTOR MORRISON TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW WE DEFINE CHILDREN SO WE DEFINE CHILDREN AS AS MINOR SEVEN SEVENTEEN AND UNDER OUR EVALUATIONS TEND TO FOCUS ON- THE MOST SENSITIVE POPULATIONS WHICH IS OFTEN. ON WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE AS WELL AS CHILDREN AGE TO IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN FOR THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES AS WELL AS WHERE I'M THERE'S KEY MILESTONES IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BUT AGREE THAT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY TIME WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND SO. ON THAT EVALUATION HAPPENS ON A PESTICIDE BY PESTICIDE CASE DEPENDING ON WHAT DATA IS AVAILABLE. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT ANALYSIS. THANK YOU. MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTIONS GO TOWARDS- YOU BROUGHT UP THE CAL PASS SYSTEM- SO JUST KIND OF THE BRIEF ON ON HOW IT'S GOING AND THEN YOU KNOW THE MILES STONES DATA YOU ARE USING TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS BEING COMPLETED AS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED WITH THE BUDGET BECAUSE WE KNOW IN THE PAST THESE ELECTRONIC PROGRAMS OF STRUGGLED IN A FAILED SO WHAT WHAT IS BEING DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON TRACK THAT WE'RE MEETING THE MILESTONES AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS- THERE'S A CHALLENGE FOR ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS WITH THE STATE AND CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM AS WELL. WHAT WE'VE DONE IN APPROACHING- THE SYSTEM IS REALLY LEARNING FROM OUR PAST EXPERIENCES WITH DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS LOOKING AT OTHER. AND SSTEMS TO REALLY TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT RISKS FROM SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS ADDRESSING STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS WITH THAT SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT WERE ADOPTING THAT ARE THERE NEW TO OUR DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. ONE IS A WORK TO RATHER THAN BUILD UP TO A SINGLE SYSTEM RELEASED AT THE END OF DEVELOPMENT WE'RE LOOKING TO HAVE MODULES RELEASED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE NEXT. ON TWO TO THREE YEARS THAT THERE ARE- SO THEY ARE STAKEHOLDERS ARE SEEING THAT DEVELOPMENT ABLE TO START. MOVING AWAY FROM OUR PAPER BASIS IN THIS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS WELL. PAYMENTS WHICH WILL ALSO COME WITH THE SYSTEM WE KNOW IS A KEY CONCERN. AND WE HAVE AT LEAST QUARTERLY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT WERE WORKING TO SCHEDULE TO BE ABLE TO. TEST OUT THE SYSTEM RECEIVE FEEDBACK PROVIDE UPDATES ON THE CURRENT STATUS. I'M AND ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OVERSIGHT ELEMENTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON TRACK WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING SO WE'VE GOTTEN TO CONTRACT I BELIEVE LAST MONTH. ON AND ARE WORKING ON STARTING TO DEVELOP AND SORE EXPECTING TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE MILESTONES OF NEW PRODUCTS RELEASED LATER THIS YEAR. THANK YOU I'M WORKING ON WITH SIMILAR- SALAS ON ON A- TECHNOLOGICAL BILL FOR THE STATE TO KIND OF. GET OUR SYSTEMS UP TO DATE. SO IT'S KNOWING HOW THESE THINGS ARE GOINGCOMING ALONG. ALSO GOES TO THE TO THE VAN OF THAT BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN IT NOT JUST YOUR AGENCY BUT ACROSS THE WHOLE. THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO GET CAUGHT UP- BUT ON THIS ONE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO. OUR PARTNERS AGRICULTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEMS WORKS OTHER SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH. THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM- JUST TO HIGHLIGHT OUT OF OUR FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES HOW MANY ARE IN THE ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT. I HAVE TO CONFIRM THE NUMBER WHEN I GET BACK TO MY OFFICE I WANNA SAY IT'S BALLPARK SEVENTY FIVE BUT I CAN CONFIRM AND GET BACK TO THE BILL ONE OF MY DOCTORS OF. THE IN THE MEDIA REPORTS HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE FAILURE DE PR. AND THE HEALTHY SCHOOL ACT. TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN WHICH WE JUST SPOKE ABOUT. AND NOTIFYING THE PARENTS. WHAT HAS THE DEPARTMENT DONE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. SO IS THE ERROR I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION NUMBER SMITH- SO IS THIS RELATED TO THE COMPLIANCE WITH- THE RESTRICTIONS ON APPLICATIONS AROUND SCHOOLS HOME I JUST GOT A REPORT THAT THE NEWS MEDIA IS REPORTING THAT THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT FOR THE- SO I SO THE CHALLENGE THAT- WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING. AS WITH THE REFINEMENT IN THE LEVEL OF REPORTING THAT WE REQUIRE THROUGHOUT REGULATION SO- IT REQUIRES REPORTING FIVE APPLICATIONS ON FIELDS AND THE SCHOOLS REGULATIONS- LIMIT CERTAIN APPLICATIONS WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A SCHOOL. AND SO THE REPORTING THAT REPORTS ON A FIELD THAT STRADDLES THAT QUARTER MILE. BUFFER ZONE AND- THE AREA OUTSIDE OF IT- ISN'T SUFFICIENTLY REFINED TO TRACK COMPLIANCE AND SO WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AG COMMISSIONERS TO GUIDE THEIR GROWERS TO BETTER TO REPORT. WHAT APPLICATIONS ARE HAPPENING- WITHIN THAT QUARTER MILE IN AT WHAT TIME SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE WHETHER THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TIMING RESTRICTIONS ON APPLICATIONS. AND THEN WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT. REVIEWING OUR REGULATIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT POTENTIAL CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS COMPLIANCE TRACKING. IN ORDER FOR MORE IS THERE ANY.
