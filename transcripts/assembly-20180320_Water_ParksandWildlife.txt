IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THEIR TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND JUNIOR HUNTERS IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT NUMBER HAS DROPPED TO JUST FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED. DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE. IN LARGE PART DEPENDENT ON THE REVENUES GENERATED BY OUTDOOR SPORTING ACTIVITIES TO FUND VITAL CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. IF THE NUMBER OF HUNTERS IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO PLUMMET. THESE REVENUES WE PUT SIGNIFICANT JEOPARDY THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO MAKE HUNTING MORE AFFORDABLE FOR YOUTH. WHO WE NEED FRANKLY TO BECOME THE NEXT GENERATION OF HUNTERS? ONE OF THE LARGEST BARRIERS FOR CALIFORNIANS INTERESTED IN THIS TRADITION. IS THE UNNECESSARILY HIGH PRICE USED BIG GAME TAX. WHERE'S CALIFORNIA JUNIOR HUNTERS PAY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR HELP TAG YOUTH IN MONTANA COLORADO PAY TEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THIS DIVIDE BY GIVING JUNIOR HUNTERS ACCESS TO LOWER COST TAGS. FOR ANTELOPE ELK BAIRD BIGHORN RAM. THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE NUMBER OF TOTAL TAX ON OFFER WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE BASED ON BIOLOGICAL FACTORS. BY KEEPING THE BILL LIMITED TO THE SPECIES WE REMOVE FINANCIAL BARRIERS FOR JUNIOR HUNTER PARTICIPATION WHILE KEEPING IN MIND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE BIG GAME MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT. THE BILL HAS AN ESTIMATED PRICE TAG OF JUST OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND PER YEAR FROM ACCOUNT WHICH RECEIVES ONE AND A HALF TO TWO MILLION IN REVENUE ANNUALLY.

TWENTY THREE THIRTY NINE THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE THIRTY NINE. WHICH SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE WATER. SERVICE FOR CALIFORNIANS MANY CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVE THEIR DRINKING WATER FROM SMALL PUBLIC ON SYSTEMS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN. THESE TROUBLED SYSTEMS LACK THE RESOURCES TO FUND THE ONGOING COST OF MAINTENANCE NEEDED TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. SMALL WATER SYSTEMS CAN OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES BY CONSOLIDATING WITH THEIR NEIGHBORING SYSTEMS CONSOLIDATION. OF WATER SYSTEMS CAN BE TO SHARE COSTS AND PROVIDE A BETTER WATER SERVICE ECONOMY OF SCALE. ALTHOUGH SOME CITIES MAY WANT TO VOLUNTARILY CONSOLIDATE THEIR TROUBLED WATER SYSTEM. THEY HAVE TO OVERCOME THESE PARTICULAR BARRIERS ONE VARIAS THE COST OF HOLDING A FULL BLOWN ELECTION TO APPROVE THE SALE OF A SMALL WATER. SYSTEM. UNDER EXISTING LAW EVEN IF THEY CITY HAS WATER SYSTEM WITH ONLY TEN CONNECTIONS. A COMPLETE ELECTION ON THE WATER SKIS ONE OPPONENT ON THE A COMPLETE ELECTION. OF WOULD BE NEEDED BEFORE THE SALE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE WHILE THE COST OF HOLDING AN ELECTION. IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT TO LARGE CITIES HOWEVER IS VARIOUS A SIGNIFICANT AND EXPENSIVE TO TAXPAYERS OF SMALL COMMUNITIES. THEREFORE THIS BILL SEEKS TO MODIFY THE ELECTION REQUIREMENTS AND ALLOW CITIES TO SAY OUT THERE SMALL PUBLIC A WATER SYSTEMS IF IT'S IS IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE A PARTICULAR CITIES OR JURISDICTIONS. I'M NOT TO OPERATE. THESE CHANGES PROVIDES MORE CALIFORNIANS WERE CLEANER AND SAFER DRINKING WATER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OF TODAY OF THIS BILL SUPPORTED. BY.

I AM THE MAYOR OF MONTEBELLO IN LA COUNTY MY NAME IS VANESSA BUT YOU HAVE THOUGH AND I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE SPELL. OUT WE ARE ONE OF THE AFFECTED CITIES AND WE HAVE A VERY SMALL WATER SYSTEM ONE OF FIVE THAT HAS SIXTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY CUSTOMERS WE'VE HAD TO INCREASE RATES. A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE LAST THREE YEARS FOR THIS WORKING CLASS AREA. AND WE STILL RUN A DEFICIT. SO WE ARE ASKING TO BE ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE WITH ONE OF THE OTHER PROVIDERS. AYE WE ARE ALSO FACING FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE SO COSTLY FOR THE SPORT SIXTEEN HUNDRED. CUSTOMERS TO ABSORB SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AN URGENT MESSAGE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MMBERS I'M JACK TALKS BAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER SAYS HE ASIAN. YOUR CALL I TESTIFIED BEFORE YOU. ABOUT. TWO MONTHS AGO PONDA ED THE ON EARLIER VERSION OF THIS BILL. YOU'LL RECALL THAT AFTER IT THAT PASSED OUT OF WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE WAS HELD BY OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. SO THAT THERE WOULD BE. ADDITIONAL THAT COULD BE ADDITIONAL REVIEW BY THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL A GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE IN ADDITION TO THIS COMMITTEE. THE. BUT A AS A RESULT OF THAT HEARING. AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY NINE HAS A NUMBER OF CHANGES. THAT CAME AS A RESULT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMITTEE IN AMONG THOSE CHANGES ARE. THAT THE. POTENTIALLY SUBSUMED THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED WATER PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. MUST BE WHOLLY WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE. MUNICIPALITY. IF. AS YOU JUST HEARD IF OF RATE INCREASES NECESSARY TO BRING THE SUBSUMED ACQUIRED SYSTEM. OUT OF THE DISREPAIR AND BRING IT UP TO STANDARD. THOSE RATES THOSE INCREASES WITHIN BE PHASED IN OVER TIME IT WOULDN'T BE ONE BIG. RATE SHOCK AT EL ALL AT ONCE. THAT'S A NEW. PROVISION IN THE BILL. THERE'S NOW A FORTY FIVE DAY ALLOWANCE FOR A PROTEST PERIOD UPON THE. APPROVAL OF THE A RESOLUTION FROM FROM THE. THE MUNICIPALITY. AND. THE. THEY HEARING FOR THAT RESOLUTION. MUST BE PUBLISHED OR NOTICED. BEFORE THE. A RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND. THE. THE RESOLUTION MUST STATE THE CITY'S INTENDED USE OF THE. OF THE PROCEEDS AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S A TIME OUT PROCESS. SUCH THAT IF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE OTHER VOTERS APPROACH. OF THE INTERESTED PERSONS AS ITS STATE IN THE BILL PROTESTS. OF IN THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR SO THEIR NUMBER OF CHANGES. TO THIS BILL BUT THE BY AND LARGE IT'S IT'S WHAT YOU HEARD BACK IN JANUARY AND. WE WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT. THE WITNESSES. WHICH IS BIG IN FAVOR OF THIS MEASURE. ST AT NO ONE ANY. THERE'S A MOTION BY MISTER THANK YOU CHIU SECOND AND SHE GALLAGHER ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. IS MEASURES SEEN NO ONE. I QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TOTALS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GIPSON THINK FOR THIS MEASURE OBVIOUSLY. THE WAY I SEE IT IS AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IT'S JUST THE OPTION OF THE SMALLER. DISTRICTS IF THEY WISH TO CONSOLIDATE WHICH USUALLY LEADS TO A LOWERING OF THEIR WATER RATES BECAUSE OF THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE. I DO APPRECIATE IN THE BILL AND READING IT I THE LEGISLATION THAT TALKS ABOUT. THE ABILITY TO STILL TRIGGER AN ELECTION. SHOULD THERE BE AN ISSUE WITH THE RATE PAYERS. THEY CAN THEY STILL HAVE THAT OPTION MOVING FORWARD AS WELL THERE'S CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU WITHOUT ALL SUPPORT THANK YOU ISABELLA. I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE LEGISLATION AND I THINK THINK THE AUTHOR I'M. FOR FOR WORKING WITH ME THIS I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL. TO HAVE BEEN AND I I THINK ADDING IN THE THE PROVISIONS. THAT ALLOW THE VOTERS TO TRIGGER A VOTE IF IF ENOUGH PEOPLE PROTEST THE DECISION YOU MAKE PUTS US MORE IN LINE WITH PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN AND HELPS PROTECT. AND THE INTEREST OF TAXPAYERS ON. BUT ALSO I MEAN THAT I THINK THAT THE LARGER ISSUE IS IT IS AS MADAME MAYOR YOU POINTED OUT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HAVE I COME AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT MYSELF. AS I KNOW AND AS THE AUTHOR. AND HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS AND SIMILAR SITUATION. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE WE HAD A VERY SMALL. SYSTEM THEY SEE HUNDRED USERS IN A VERY RURAL COMMUNITY. AND. WITH REALLY NO OTHER OPTIONS OTHER THAN TO RAISE RATES AT SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. VERY SIGNIFICANTLY TO DO THAT CLEAN UP TIED TO DO AND. INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. AND REALLY IF THEY'RE ABLE TO MERGE WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM. ECONOMIES OF SCALE THERE FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS JUST MADE A LOT OF SENSE AND SO HAVING THIS TOOL OUT THERE I THINK IS. UNIT AND IS VERY MUCH NEEDED AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE REALLY JUST KINDA STRANDED. ON THEIR OWN AND. YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE. WITH THAT SYSTEM IN PLACE RIGHT NOW REALLY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO IT OTHER THAN TO RAISE RATES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. AND SO I THINK. HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET THIS THIS MEASURE THROUGH AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S HARD WORK ON THIS. AND. I WILL BE VOTING IN IN FAVOR THANK YOU. QUESTION BUT ADOPTED. YEAH PART QUESTION. UP I WOULD SUPPORT DODD DESPAIR LA. BUT THUS MORE QUESTION IS THAT DON'T WIN NOT MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF LA OF REST AND SO. A PROTESTER. AND UP WILL TEST MEANS THAT IN THE FORM OF A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE MEETINGS SEWER IN THE FORM OF. SIGNATURE GATHERING. AND. A IF THAT HAPPENED IS. THE MONEY SPUR GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR. IF THE SECOND YEAR SIMPLY HAPPENED SO OR BE ANOTHER YEAR DELAY. Y. HA HOW LONG DOES IT HAVE TO REPEAT THAT THAT PROCESS. WHAT WHAT YEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH? IT'S IT'S ONE YEAR BUT IF THAT'S IF THAT'S THAT MUCH OPPOSITION I THINK THAT KILLS. KILLS THE THAT THE SALE. NOT OPPOSITION MONTH SO. IF IT'S THAT MUCH OPPOSITION BASING YOUR EXAMPLE I THINK THE MESSES ROW CLEAR IT'S NOT A FIRST OF ALL IT STOPS IMMEDIATELY THEN AWAITS A ONE YEAR. THEN AS YOU DESCRIBE IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN A SECOND YEAR AND THEN A THIRD YEAR I THINK THE MESSAGE IS VERY CLEAR. TO THE GOVERNMENTAL BODIES THAT THERE'S STRONG OPPOSITION TO IT. BUT IT STOPPED FOUR YEAR. AND THAT'S HOW WE GONNA COUNT TO FIFTY PERCENT OR MORE BROUGH GRAYSON SUPPORT IN ESTA. IN THE SIGNATURE PHONO THROUGH ITS PRESENCE OR OR WRITTEN. OF THE PROTESTS.

THANK YOU THAT DON'T MOTION SECOND TO AND THE. DISAPPOINTMENT BREVITY HERE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HYPO. OKAY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED CERTAINLY MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DAVID EBENEZER I'M WITH RURAL COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE CORPORATION BE PROVIDED THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES. TO. MAKE SURE THEY HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CURRENTLY THE STATE LAW ALLOWS. WATER AND WASTEWATER PROJECTS THAT SERVE DECIDED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. TO RECEIVE A. FUN AT THAT PRECEDE FUNDING UNDER THAT. INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN FUNDING. TO THE QUESTION ADVANCES UP TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PROJECT. IF THERE PROJECT COSTS ARE ONE MILLION ARE LESS. IF THE PROJECT BECAUSE EVEN A DOLLAR MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR. OF THE ADVANCES A AND FREQUENTLY THERE ARE LONG DELAYS IN. THE REIMBURSEMENT OF UP. EXPENSES TO THE SMALL COMMUNITIES SO PUT OF CASH FLOW BURDEN ON. THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THAT THEY INCUR PENALTIES AND ADDITIONAL PROJECT COSTS FROM. CONTRACTORS. ALSO A S. B. TOOL EIGHT ONLY ADDRESSED. THEIR URBAN PROJECTS. NOW THERE'S SIMILAR COMMUNITIES UNDER. RECEIVING FUNDING UNDER THE PROP PROPOSITION ONE FUNDING. AND. THEY ARE FACING SIMILAR CHALLENGES. SO. WE. RECENTLY RECEIVED TO. LINE OF CREDIT REQUESTS FROM FOR A TO SMALL COMMUNITIES BOLIVAR DE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT AND PIXLEY PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT.

BRIAN AGAINST ON BEHALF OF THE OF SELF HELP ENTERPRISES IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT. ANY OPPOSITION. I'D SEEN UNDER WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I KNOW ONE THING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP MISTER CHAIRMAN DISTANT FROM OUR ANALYSIS WAS THAT THIS ALSO REMOVES DESCENT EXISTING SUNSET. I HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW SAID A JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE. YOU KNOW HAVING THE SUNSET THEIR LEAST ALLOWS SOME REVIEW OF THE PROGRAM TO SEE HOW IT'S WORKING. AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. YOU. CONSIDER IS A JUST BE. MAYBE SOME COMMENT ON THAT AS MUCH IT WOULD BE MY QUESTION. SO IT SO WE KNOW THAT. THE PROGRAM IS WORKING IT'S GUYS GOT SOME CHALLENGES FOR SOME OF THESE ECONOMIC NEED IT'S ABOUT COMMUNITIES. CASH STRAPPED THEM. AND OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE. TYPICALLY CARRIED OUT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND SO. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS. I CERTAINLY WOULD CONSIDER A ANOTHER TYPE OF FOR A REVIEW PROCESS THAT WOULD DETERMINE. EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE REYES WHICH IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS WORKING I'M NOT BUT I THINK. THE PROGRAM IS WORKING IN GENERAL BUT CERTAINLY HAS SOME BARRIERS AT. WE'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL. NOW MR SAUCE. THANK YOU THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN. CHAIRMAN. SO I UP A YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A BUNCH OF A RURAL COMMUNITIES AND OBVIOUSLY ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS IS. ONE OF PARAMOUNT CONCERNS. BUT I WAS LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW SO WHO REMOVE THE CAP THAT'S YOU NO WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT HOW DO WE PREVENT LIKE BAD ACTORS IN THE FUTURE. CITED NO IF YOU HAD SAW. TO WE PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AROUND AWARDING THE FUNDS TO THOSE ENTITIES THAT CAN PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL AND THAT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO. ADMINISTER THESE FUNDS OR DO YOU SEE THAT BEING SPELLED OUT IN THE LEGISLATION. AS THIS BILL MOVES FURTHER ALONG. THAT PUBLIC. SOME MAN UP TO TAKE A LOOK AT IN FURTHER DETAIL I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT. I THINK SOMETHING TO. FOCUS ON IS THAT YOU KNOW ELIMINATE THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR CAP ON PROJECTS. OR FIFTY PERCENT OF THE GRANT AWARD WOULD CHIPPER'S LESS IS REALLY KIND HOW WE. SAID IT SO THAT IT DOESN'T EXCEED. BE CAP. THAT THAT YOU REFERRED TO. BUT IN TERMS OF THE DETAILS THAT. TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. DICK YOU'RE WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS SIMILAR TO EXISTING LAW. WHICH OF ALREADY PROVIDES PROTECTION FROM THEFT AND OTHER. UNFORTUNATE EVENTS COTTON SO. MIGHT BE FREE WE ALL BE DOING ITS LIMIT IN A CHANGING THAT THE CAP THE CAP EVERYTHING ELSE DAIS. THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT PIECE YOU'RE LOOKING AT KENNETH TIGHTER OVERSIGHT IS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT IS A MAKING SURE THAT. THERE ISN'T.

REALLY VALID CONCERNS THAT WE JUST PUT THIS IN PLACE AND IN. AND SO HERE WE ARE COUPLE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN THE FULL WRATH OF. ACTUAL RESULTS MERELY JUST BECAUSE OF THIS WE'RE SEEING SOME SOME ACTION SO MAYBE IT DOES WARRANT SOMETHING.

AB TWENTY SIXTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THE INTEGRATED REGIONAL MANAGEMENT PROCESSES ARE WORKABLE FOR SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. UNDER EXISTING LAW DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE AN ADVANCE PARA OF UP TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE GRANT AWARD TO THE INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES THIS ADVANCED PAYMENT PROCESS HAS BEEN WORKING WELL BUT IT DOES NOT FULLY ADDRESSED THE CASH FLOW PROBLEMS THE SMALL ORGANIZATIONS. EVICTING WITH VIC EXPERIENCE. UNDER TRADITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT MODEL A TWENTY SIXTY FOUR ENSURES THAT THE SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE AN ADVANCE PAYMENT FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE GRANT AWARD. SIMILAR IN THE MANNER FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE AWARD. I APPRECIATE GREATLY THE INSIGHTS OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND I COMMIT TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES RAISED ANNOUNCES. PACIFIC WE WORKING WITH AN AYE INCORPORATING ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT APPLY TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE ADVANCE GRANT PAYMENT THIS IS CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE FIRST HALF AGO ADVANCE GRANT PICKED PAYMENT.

JOINING THIS MORNING AT TWO WITNESSES GLENN FARROW WITH THE CITY OF COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY AND MARK STADLER FROM SAN DIEGO INNOVATIVE REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT ADVISORY GROUP I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER GURIAN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AYE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GLENN FOR A WITH THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY. THE INTERPRETER REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS ONLY AS STRONG AS ITS MEMBERSHIP. WE BELIEVE THAT A GREAT REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE ARE. AT BEST. FUNCTIONING WHERE AND MOST PRODUCTIVE MOST SUCCESSFUL MOST CREDIBLE WHEN THERE'S ROBUST PARTICIPATION FROM THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. WATER AGENCIES MUNICIPALITIES WATER COMPANIES TRIBES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS ANOTHER COMMITTEE INTEREST GROUPS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER ENTITIES. NOW WE WANT TO RESOLVE THOSE SO THAT THOSE I'M IN A GOOD REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT GROUPS REMAIN ROBUST. PRODUCTIVE INCREDIBLE ON THEN IN THAT REGARD WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE. PARTICIPATION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY GROUPS AND AND PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT THE INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM DOES. IN FACT PROPOSITION ONE THE NEW GRANT PROGRAM FOR OUR W. M.. REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST TWENTY PERCENT OF THE GRANT FUNDS GO TO PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. CURRENTLY THE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE SECOND HALF OF A GRANT. FOR DISADVANTAGED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY HAS TO BE. BUT PUT PUT FORWARD ON A. TRADITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT BASIS CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE CASH FLOW ISSUES AND REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO FRONT THE STATE SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AT A TIME. AYE AND WAIT TO GET REIMBURSED SO. AB TWENTY SIXTY FOUR WOULD REMOVE THAT ROADBLOCK FROM THE PATH OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY REQUIRE PARTICIPATION. AND I RESPECTFULLY IT'S A REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. I THINK YOU DISH NO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND ALSO IN SUPPORT. JACK WALKS CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT.

WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM WE HAVE A. COUPLE OF PANELISTS IT ALREADY READY TO GO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO CALL ROLE FOR THIS ONE. THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US AND THAT'S GET US STARTED WE HAVE AMONG LOOKING DENTAL CHAIR OF THE. CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION CAROL BAKER VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION. CITY TUCKED. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES MAURICE ALSO SEE IT. VICE PRESIDENT OF WATER. FOR THE ECOSYSTEMS PROGRAM OF I'M A DEFENSE FUND WE'RE GONNA LET EVERYONE DO THEIR PRESENTATION. AND THEN NOW WE WILL BEGIN THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AND OPEN TO HAVE. A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH YOU ALL THIS WHILE. AND THEN TAKE SOME OF. PUBLIC COMMENTS AFTER THAT SO WE'LL START IN THE ORDER MISTER KING THEY'RE WELCOME. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MET MY LOOKING TOTAL AND. MORNING TOLD ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND EVERYONE WHO IS JOINING US THIS MORNING. A THE CALTRANS WATER COMMISSION CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN THE ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE TO SECURE CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT GOAL. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING KEY STEPS THIS SUMMER AS A PART OF THE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. WELL AS YOU KNOW THE BROWN ADMINISTRATIONS CALIFORNIA WATER ACTION PLAN CALLS FOR INVESTMENTS IN ABOVE AND BELOW GROUND WATER STORAGE. TO HELP PREPARE FOR THE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN FUTURE DROUGHTS. THE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM FUELED BY THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FROM THE VOTER APPROVED PROP ONE. PROPOSITION ONE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO KICK START. VITAL PROJECTS BY PROVIDING FUNDS FOR SPECIFIED PUBLIC BENEFITS RICHER ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED PROJECTS. THE COMMISSION DEVELOPED THE PROGRAM WITH EXTENSIVE INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND BY THE CLOSE OF THE APPLICATION PERIOD IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'D RECEIVED TWELVE APPLICATIONS SEEKING A TOTAL OF FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING. FOR BOTH SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE. COMMISSION STAFF AND TECHNICAL REVIEW TEAMS CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ELEVEN OF THOSE APPLICATIONS AND THE COMMISSION MEMBERS ARE SET TO BEGIN MAKING INITIAL FUNDING DIRK DETERMINATIONS THIS SUMMER. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT NO FUNDING DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE COMMISSION AT THIS TIME. AND ALL PROJECTS REMAIN ACTIVE IN POTENTIALLY VIABLE IN THIS PROCESS. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS PROCESS WILL RESULT IN DOLLARS GOING OUT THE DOOR TO QUALIFY IN PROJECTS LATER THIS YEAR. ONLY TO COVER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS AND WHY WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC BENEFITS OF THE PROJECTS. AND THAT IS A PROPOSITION ONE WHICH IS PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. WAS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR WATER STORAGE CAN BE USED. THE MEASURE STATES THAT THE COMMISSION MAY ONLY FUND THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH WATER STORAGE PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE THE OPERATION OF THE STATE WATER SYSTEM. ARE COST EFFECTIVE AND PROVIDE A NET IMPROVEMENT IN ECOSYSTEM IN WATER QUALITY CONDITIONS. WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM FUNDS ARE FOR THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC BENEFITS. SPECIFIED IN LANGUAGE IN THE LANGUAGE OF PROPOSITION ONE CHAPTER EIGHT. THOSE ARE ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. FLOOD CONTROL EMERGENCY RESPONSE RECREATIONAL PURPOSES IN THIS ALSO INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT FOR PROJECTS TO SHOW A MEASURABLE ECOSYSTEM IMPROVEMENT TO THE DELTA. OR TO ITS TRIBUTARIES. THERE'S A QUOTE THAT I RAN ACROSS IN THE DAY WHICH I REALLY LIKED AND APPLIES VERY MUCH THIS PROGRAM. IN THE QUOTE IS IN GOD WE TRUST BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE WE NEED DATA. AND SO UP FUNDING THESE PUBLIC BONTA BENEFITS IS INTENDED TO HELP LOCAL PROJECT PROPONENTS COMPLETE THE FUNDING PICTURE OR FOR THEIR PROJECTS. IN DOES NOTED WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE EVALUATION PROCESS OF THE PROGRAM. STAFF IS REVIEWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY APPLICANTS APPEALS TO THE ADDITIONAL INITIAL TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO. WATER COMMISSION STAFF AND SUBJECT AREA EXPERTS MET WITH ALL PROJECT PROPONENTS IN PUBLIC MEETINGS IN FEBRUARY TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS AND TO CLARIFY INFORMATION THAT WAS NEEDED IN THE APPEAL PROCESS. AND ALL OF THESE INTERVIEWS ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE AT THE WATER COMMISSION WEBSITE. IN MAY COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BEGIN OUR PUBLIC DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOCUSED FIRST ON DETERMINING A FINAL PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO FOR EACH PROJECT. AND THEN THE REMAINING COMPONENTS SCORES FOR EACH PROJECT. ARE THE VICE. CHAIR BAKER WILL ELABORATE MORE ON THE NEXT STEPS IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. GENTLEMAN COVERED WITH. NOT JUST MENTION A FEW MORE THINGS BEFORE IT HANDED OVER TO CAROL. OR VICE CHAIR BAKER. ARE THE CHRISTIANS WORKED SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP ONE FOR TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROCESS. WE DEVELOPED THE STATUTORY REQUIRED REGULATIONS TO A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT INCLUDED APPLICANTS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PUBLIC. THESE REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED IT WAS A TWO YEAR PROCESS AND THESE REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION IN TWELVE IN DECEMBER FOURTEENTH TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH CONSISTENT WITH THE STATUTORY DEADLINE. THE REGULATIONS WERE APPROVED BY O. A L. IS INITIALLY SUBMITTED BY THE COMMISSION. AND THE APPLICATION SOLICITATION BEGAN ONE WEEK AFTER THE REGULATIONS PRINT WERE IN EFFECT AND THE APPLICATION COULD REMAIN OPEN FOR FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS WITH PAUL STAFF AVAILABLE FOR APPLICANT CONSULTATION ON THEIR APPLICATIONS. THIS IS ALMOST SIXTY PEOPLE FROM DOM STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD FISH AND WILDLIFE AND DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ALL SUBJECT AREA EXPERTS WHO COULD ASSIST APPLICANTS WITH THEIR PROJECTS. VICE CHAIR BAKER. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE HERE I'M CAROL BAKER VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION. AS THE CHAIR INDICATED WERE ABOUT TO MOVE INTO OF THE COMMISSION DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THE FIRST. THE THREE THREE DAY OF MEETINGS THE FIRST BEING IN MAY WHERE THE COMMISSION WILL. MAKE A DETERMINATION UP ON THE PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO. IN JUNE OF WILL BE MAKING THE COMMISSION WILL BE MAKING A DETERMINATION ON PROJECTS SCORES. AND IN JULY. BOTH THE COMMISSION WILL BE DETERMINING THE MAXIMUM CONDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY FOR FUNDING. AND FUND IT AND EARLY FUNDING AWARDS. THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO APPROPRIATE. PRODUCTIVE INTERFACES WITH APPLICANTS DURING THE PROCESS DURING THIS PROCESS. IT'S A VERY COMPLEX PROCESS. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO BEING RESPONSIVE AND TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF. THE REGULATIONS ALLOWED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE SUBMITTED. DURING THE BEEN A BASIC ELIGIBILITY INCOME COMPLETENESS SPACE. A WHICH OCCURRED LAST FALL. AND THE APPLICANT APPEAL PHASE WHICH OCCURRED IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR. THE COMMISSION ALSO RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL INTERACTIONS. A THERE WERE A DID AT. WE ADDED THE THIRTY THREE HOURS OF APPLICANT MEETINGS. IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR. WERE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR STAFF TO CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL INTERACTIONS. A IN THE REMAINDER OF THE PROCESS. FUTURE INTERACTIONS NEED TO A NEED TO BE A BALANCE. IF YOU. THE FUTURE INTERACTIONS NEED TO BALLOTS PURPOSE INEFFECTIVENESS IN TRANSPARENCY. FAIRNESS EFFECTIVENESS AND TIMELINE. THE COMMISSION REMAINS DEDICATED TO MOVING THE MONEY OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. TRANSPARENCY AND. PUBLIC DECISION MAKING. ADDED. A ADDITIONAL TIME TO THE PROCESS. AT WE HAD OVER FIFTY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS DURING THE REGULATION DEVELOPMENT. ONCE THE REGULATIONS WERE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION THEY MOVED ON TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. WHERE THEY WHEREBY THEY HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS FOR THEIR? REVIEW OF OUR REGULATIONS AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED. AND AS I JUST DESCRIBED WE HAVE A. STEP WISE THREE DAY. THREE THREE DAY MEETINGS. FOR OUR DECISION DECISION MAKING PROCESS. AFFECTING THIS OF THE PROCESS RELIES ON THE COMMISSION'S DECISIONS THE SUMMER. HOWEVER. IT ALSO RELIES ON APPLICANTS EFFORTS TO MEET THE STOCK IT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE BAR. THE JANUARY EXCUSE ME THE JULY COMMISSION PLUMERI DECISIONS ARE CONDITIONAL. AFTER WE DO OUR PART. THE APPLICANTS HAVE SEVERAL OTHER KEY STEPS A IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS THE. APPLICANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING OF THE FOLLOWING. I'M PLEADING FEASIBILITY STUDIES. COMPLETE ALL ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION. OBTAIN ALL OTHER FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL APPROVALS. SECURE FUNDING. NOT COVERED BY THE. WITH PROGRAM IT'S REQUIRED IN PROP ONE. FOR THOSE PROJECTS WITH LONG PRE A. PRE CONSTRUCTION TIME LINES. THOSE PROJECTS MUST MEET. A NOT ONLY MEAT THEY FOR MENTIONED REQUIREMENTS BY JANUARY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY STE TO THERE ARE SEVERAL EXCEPTIONS. THEY'LL HAVE TO HAVE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDING COMMITMENT. FOR NON PROGRAM COST SHARES. AND A PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT. TO BE. IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY AND THE COMMISSION OUT RETAINS THE DECISION MAKING. IN THE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. AND ES INVESTORS AND PARTNERS OF THE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROJECTS. THE COMMISSION HAS ENTRUSTED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO INVEST THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR MEASURABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND TO ACHIEVE WATER RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY AS ENVISIONED IN THE GOVERNOR'S WATER ACTION PLAN. ADDITIONALLY THE FUNDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE ALLOCATED IN THE COMPETITIVE. FAIR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS AND THIS IS A UNIQUE AND COMPLEX PROGRAM. WERE ALL PAIN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO THIS AS IS OUR APPLICANTS IN MUCH LIKE OUR APPLICANTS. THE COMMISSION IS EAGER TO OBLIGATE THE FUNDS AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES IN THIS PROGRAM. WE HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT THIS PROCESS RESULT IN FUNDING BEING AWARDED TO. ELIGIBLE PROJECTS THAT OFFER THE BEST RETURN ON THE PUBLIC'S INVESTMENT. AND WE VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND CAROL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL GOING TO NEXT WEEK I KNOW I HAVE COLLEAGUES WHO ARE READY TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT WHAT WILL CONCLUDE WITH A. FOURTH SPEAKER AND THEN WILL WILL JUMP RIGHT IN. GREAT THINK FUTURE GARCIA IN MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HEARD TODAY CINDY TALK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. AQUA REPRESENTS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TOGETHER THEY PROVIDE ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE WATER THAT'S DISTRIBUTED FOR THE PUBLIC FOR AG IN FOR BUSINESS. I'M IN MY COMMENTS TODAY IN UNIT HARDCOVER FOUR POINTS ONE SOME BRIEF HISTORY ON PROP ONE WHICH IS RELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY. TWO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STORAGE FUNDING THREE AND PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IT'S ON COULD PROCESS STEPS THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST. AND FOURTH A LINK TO FEDERAL FUNDING WHICH IS GOOD TO HAVE IN MIND. SO ON THOUGH HISTORY ON PROP ONE IN MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS FIRST HAND. BY PROP ONE WASN'T WRITTEN IN. ALL IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT GOES BACK TO THE PACKAGE FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE. THAT BILL ON IT WAS BY A SENATOR COG DEAL AND THAT WAS ELEVEN POINT ONE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND. THAT GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED. AND AFTER TWO THOUSAND NINE WE WERE IN THE RECESSION IN THERE WERE DECISIONS MADE BY I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS THAT. VOTE ON THE BOND SHOULD BE DELAYED AND SO IT WAS DELAYED UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TRIM THE BOND DOWN FROM AT ELEVEN POINT ONE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND TO THE SEVEN POINT FIVE OR SO BILLION DOLLAR BOND. THAT WENT TO THE VOTERS. SOTHAT YOUR AND I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THE ASSEMBLY VOTED SEVENTY SEVEN TWO TWO. AND ON THE SENATE VOTED THIRTY SEVEN TO ZERO GOVERNOR BROWN IMMEDIATELY SIGN THE BILL FOR US THAT WITH A VERY EXCITING DAY WE HAVE A PICTURE ABOUT UP IN THE OFFICE. IN IN IN THE OF COURSE THE KEY EVENT IS THAT IT WENT TO THE VOTERS AS PROP ONE IN THE PAST BY SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT. I GO THROUGH THAT JUST TO SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACTOR. THE GOVERNOR ACTED THE VOTERS ACTED IN THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE MONEY WHEN YOU PASS A BOND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE MONEY WILL BE ALLOCATED AND SO WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR THAT. VERY POSITIVE STATEMENTS OF THE THE COMMISSIONERS THIS MORNING. SO THAT'S THE HISTORY. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE. PROF WHEN STORAGE MONEY. UP THE CHAPTER EIGHT LANGUAGE FOCUSES A LOT ON PUBLIC BENEFITS IN IN PARTICULAR. ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS ARE IT ECOSYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. AND WHY IS THAT. AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT STORAGE IS REALLY IMPORTANT FROM A WATER SUPPLY MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT AND FLOOD PROTECTION. THAT'S STILL VERY TRUE TODAY BUT WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT WE HAVE STORAGE TO HELP PROVIDE WATER FOR THE ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS SUCH AS SENSUAL SEASONAL FISH FLOWS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANTED TO MENTION IN CHAIR QUINN PARA ALREADY MENTIONED THE PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT ARE IN THE LOT SO I'M NOT GOING TO. KEEP THAT. SO NOW I COME TO THE PROCESS AT THE COMMISSION. AND I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT WHEN THE PRE APPEAL DETERMINATIONS CAME OUT FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIOS. THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN AND AQUA WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE FACT THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE REVIEWERS AT THE STATE AND THE APPLICANTS. AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMISSION HELD ADDITIONAL MEETINGS THEY WERE. INTERACTIONS WITH THE APPLICANTS BUT THEY WERE TRANSPARENT IT WAS ARE EXCELLENT PROCESS STEP WHETHER WE WITH FURTHER COMMUNICATION TO INFORM THE APPEAL PROCESS WE THINK THAT WAS CRITICAL. WE BELIEVE THAT SIMILAR FUTURE INTERACTIONS ARE IMPORTANT I HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD HAPPEN BUT FOR THE KEY MILESTONES THAT ARE COMING UP SO THAT THEY CAN INFORM THE PROCESS SO THAT IF STATE REVIEWERS HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE SUBMITTED THEY CAN ASK A QUESTION. THIS IS A A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S OF IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT IN OUR STORAGE THERE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BE A DISCUSSION BACK AND FORTH. AND AGAIN WE SUGGEST THAT THE ADDITIONAL PROCESS STEPS BE BEFORE THE KEY MILESTONES. SO THAT'S THE THE THIRD POINT. IN AN THE FOURTH POINT IS ON A COMMON ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING. THE COMMITTEE MAY ALREADY BE AWARE BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC ARE AWARE. THAT. CONGRESS ACTUALLY GOT IT TOGETHER NOT TOO LONG AGO AND PASSED A. NEW LAW ON WATER IT'S CALLED THE WIN ACT. WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE NATION'S ACT. AND THAT INCLUDES MONEY FOR STORAGE. AND ON THE KEY IS THAT FOR CALIFORNIA PROJECTS IT SPELLS OUT THAT THEY HAVE TO. SHOW THAT THE OUT BY AND I THINK THE COMMISSION ACTUALLY HAS TO DETERMINE THAT THEY MEET THE PROP ONE TESS. SO FUND THIS YEAR ARE UNDERSTANDING THE BUDGET PROCESS IS THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR WILL ACT WILL BE DOING EVALUATIONS. AND THEY WILL PROVIDE THEIR INPUT TO CONGRESS ON THIS IN AUGUST SO THE TIMING TO GET THESE DECISIONS. ARE ALLOCATION DECISIONS ON DONE THE SUMMER IS VERY IMPORTANT WE THINK THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY. AND WITH THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE PROVIDE COMMENTS AND WE'LL BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU WILL WANT TO NEXT WEEK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. CHAIRMAN GARCIA VICE CHAIR GALLAGHER OF MEMBERS OF COMMUTING GAS. REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC. MY NAME IS MAURICE HALL I LEAD TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND'S WESTERN WATER PROGRAM. AND OUR WORK IS FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR WATER SYSTEM IS RESILIENT TO MEET OUR CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR SOCIETY AND NATURE. ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND MORE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I'M WATER RESOURCES ENGINEER HYDROLOGIST IN A LAWSUIT LICENSED PROFESSIONAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF CALIFORNIA WATER FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND. AND WORKED IN OTHER ISSUES AND OTHER STATES BEFORE THAT. I REMEMBER WELL THE NEGOTIATION DROUGHT POP ONE HAS MISTOOK IS. AND. DESCRIBED IT WAS A LONG DELIVER TO PROCESS. THAT LED. TO EVENTUALLY THE ALLOCATION OF TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS. ASSOCIATE WITH WATER STORAGE PROJECTS AND IN CHAPTER EIGHT THE MEASURE. IN AT THAT TIME A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS. RECOGNIZE THAT. WE NEED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT. DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S INTENSE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR WATER RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR ECONOMY AND OUR FUTURE AND OUR WAY OF OUR FARMS AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. AND THE NEED FOR INVESTMENT HAS EVEN INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS AS WE'VE EXPERIENCED SEVERE DROUGHTS AND FLOODS INCLUDING. BETWEEN THE TIME WE FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT A BOND AND THE TIME IT WAS EVENTUALLY I GOT TO THE VOTERS. TWO OF OUR MOST SEVERE DROUGHTS ON RECORD OCCUR. BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE IN OUR HISTORY DEALING WITH DROUGHTS IT WAS CLEARED UP POLICYMAKERS AND AS I SAID A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS WORKING ON PROPOSITION ONE THAT. MORE WATER STORAGE IS NEEDED. FIRST MAJOR POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS. THAT. THIS IS A NEW VENTURE THAT WE ARE ON. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE INNOVATIVE NATURE. OF WHAT SOME OF YOU AND YOUR PREDECESSORS DID IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN NOW. THIS WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE WAY WE HAVE APPROACHED WATER STORAGE FOR MOST. OF OUR HISTORY. IN MOST OUR HISTORY ARE WATER STORAGES BEEN DESIGNED TO MEET THREE BASIC NEEDS THE FEW OTHERS AROUND THE EDGES BUT PRIMARILY FLOOD CONTROL WATER SUPPLY. AND HYDROPOWER GENERATION. AND THEN ONLY AFTER PROJECTS WERE BUILT LARGELY FOR THOSE PROCESSES THE FOR THOSE WHO. BENEFITS. WE TRIED TO CONSTRAIN THE OPERATIONS IT'S JUST HOW WE OPERATED IT CETERA TO IMPROVE THINGS LIKE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND MITIGATE FOREIGN BAR. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IMPACT EFFICIENT WHILE I. STILL A MAJOR FUNCTION OF THE RESERVOIRS. AND THE STORAGE HAS BEEN FOR FLOOD CONTROL WATER STORAGE IN A POWER GENERATION. IN CONTRAST THIS PROGRAM TURNS THAT A LITTLE BIT ON ITS HEAD AND SAYS THAT WE WILL PROACTIVELY. THINK ABOUT HOW TO USE STORAGE TO PROVIDE WATER BENEFITS. FOR THE PUBLIC INCLUDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOSYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE ACT. THE KEY PART OF THIS OF COURSE IS THE PRO ACTIVE. ASPECT OF IT DELIBERATELY PUTTING THE STORAGE TO USE. TO ME. PACIFIC PUBLIC NEEDS INCLUDING AS DESCRIBED IN THE LAW AND OTHERS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED ECOSYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. WATER QUALITY PRINTS IN THE DELTA FLOOD CONTROL. EMERGED RESPONSE AND RECREATION. THIS NEW AND AND I ACTUALLY THINK THE VISIONARY STEP. TO LOOK AT STORAGE PRESENT SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. WE HAVE A LONG LEGACY OF PROCESSES AND STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR. DEVELOPER MARMI CORBIN HERE'S BUREAU OF RECLAMATION AND OTHERS AROUND THE WORLD TO BUILD STORAGE DRUGS FOR WATER SUPPLY AND POWER GENERATION BUT. FOR ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS AND OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS AS PRESCRIBED IN THE LAW. THE ESTABLISHED PRACTICE IS NOT SO CLEAR. NO WE'RE NOT COMPLETE STARTING COMPLETELY FROM SCRATCH BUT WE DON'T HAVE. THAT IS WELL ESTABLISHED WAYS OF CHARACTERIZING HOW THE PROJECT STORAGE PROJECTS CAN BE OPERATED TO PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS. QUANTIFYING THOSE BENEFITS PRIORITIZING THEM AND MONETIZING. TO DO THIS THE WATER COMMISSION AND THEIR STAFF OF HAD TO BREAK NEW GROUND. LOTS OF NEW GROUND IN FACT. AND BY CRITIQUING THE PROJECTS. AND THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE PROPONENTS THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB. IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT IT'S TAKEN AWHILE. AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT IT HASN'T GONE ALL THAT SMOOTHLY AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HICCUPS. THAT'S NOT SURPRISING IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING FOR THE WATER COMMISSION THEIR STAFF. AND ADMITTEDLY FOR THE PROJECT PROPONENTS. AND FRANKLY WE ENVIRONMENTALLY ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY OUR OUR BIT NERVOUS. I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING STORAGE. CAN BE OPERATED PROACTIVELY FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS. OCCLUDING ANVAR ECOSYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. IS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL TOOL. BUT I THINK MOST OF US ARE SOMEWHAT NERVOUS THAT. IF IT ISN'T DONE RIGHT WE COULD END UP WITH AN EVEN WORST WITH EVEN WORSE CONDITIONS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE TO DEPEND ON OUR WHAT RIVERS AND STREAMS AND WETLANDS. AND OUR INNOVATIVE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS. WILL HAVE GONE FOR NOW. AND SET A POOR PRECEDENT. FOR THIS POSSIBLY VISIONARY A TRANSFORMATIVE WAVE USING STORAGE. NOW FOR THOSE WHO ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THE WATER SUPPLY BENEFITS OF NEW STORAGE. AND MAYBE HAVE LESS. LESS INTEREST ARE LESS FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC BENEFITS. I ALSO THINK THOSE INTEREST SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THIS PROCESS DONE RIGHT. IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS INNOVATIVE QUEST. IF THE WATER MADE AVAILABLE FOR% PUBLIC BENEFITS CAN REALLY DELIVER. AND HELP RESTORE THE AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS OF THE BAY DELTA WATERSHED. AND WE WILL REDUCE CONFLICT. AND THE WATER USERS WIN AS WELL. A MORE RESILIENT WATER SYSTEM AND ADAPT WATER SYSTEM MEANS THAT OUR WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM WORKS BETTER FOR ALL OF US. SECOND POINT ONE MAKE IS THAT AS AS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. BY OTHER SPEAKERS IN INCLUDING A COMMISSIONER CAN TARA. VICTOR WITH THE. ALTHOUGH THE TAPPED RATE HASN'T NEW AND INVENTIVE INNOVATIVE APPROACH WATER STORAGE. IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE PROJECT WOULD BE SELECTED BY THE COMMISSION THROUGH COMPETITIVE PUBLIC PROCESS. AND. AS DESCRIBED EARLIER THE CHAPTER I DO NOT GUARANTEE EARMARKED. FOR ANY SPECIFIC PROJECT. WELL I I THINK IT WAS A WISE DECISION BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SUBSEQUENTLY BY THE VOTERS IN APPROVING IT THAT. THAT ALLOWS FOR THE BEST PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD. AND INDEED SEVERAL OF THE PROJECTS THAT AM COMPETING FOR FUNDING CAN MAKE. IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S WATER STORAGE NEEDS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. IN ADDITION THERE IS ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND ALL OF THESE PROJECTS. AND SO IT IS ONLY SENSIBLE. THAT THOSE PROJECTS WITH THE MOST PROMISE FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE SELECTED FOR FUNDING. THERE ARE NUMEROUS VERY PROMISING PROJECT PROPOSED HOME ESPECIALLY IMPRESSED WITH SOME OF THE INVADING GROUND WATER PROJECTS. SOME OF WHICH PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IN PLACE. AND ALSO INCREASE WATER SUPPLY BUTA FOR HUMAN USES DURING DROUGHT YEARS. AND SOME OF THE GROUNDWATER PROJECTS ARE DESIGNED TO WORK IN CONCERT WITH EXISTING. AND POTENTIALLY FUTURE SERVICE TOWARDS RESOURCED TO INCREASE WATER SUPPLY RELEASE RESILIENCY. AND PROVIDE DIRECT PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR PATIENT WHILE. IN FACT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PROMISES OF THE WATER SYSTEM STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS THE POSSIBILITY OF OPERATING A COMBINATION OF NEW PROJECTS. IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND CONCERT WITH EXISTING STORAGE PROJECTS GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER TO MULTIPLY THE BENEFITS. BEYOND WHAT WOULD BE ACHIEVABLE WITHIN A SINGLE PROJECT. I HOPE THE COMMISSION CAN INCORPORATE CONSIDERATION OF THESE SYNERGISTIC BENEFITS IN THEIR EVALUATIONS TO ENSURE THE SELECTION OF A PORTFOLIO OF PROJECTS. THAT MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC. A THIRD POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS IS MORE PROCEDURAL AND REFLECTS OF WHAT. WHAT DONE MISTOOK DESCRIBED AND THAT'S ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT? VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE. CAN YOU TRANSPARENCY OF THE WATER COMMISSION AND IT APPEARS TO BE AND I'M AN EMPHASIS OF THE COMMISSION. AND. THE COMMISSION THOUGH AS I'VE NOTED AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE AND AND EMPHASIZED. HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE TO DO THIS QUICKLY. PROGRESS IS IMPORTANT AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SEETHE COMMISSION COMPLY WITH THE SCHEDULE LAID OUT THE LAW AND TO ENSURE THAT. THE DOLLARS DO GO TO FIND PROMISING PROJECTS. HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WITH A STAKE. AS A REASONABLE CHANCE TO FOLLOW AND ASSESS THE PROCESS. THE CURRENT SCHEDULE LAID OUT OF MY MY BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. HAS ALLOWS ONLY TEN DAYS BETWEEN THE COMMISSION STAFF ANNOUNCEMENT OF THEIR REVISED PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIOS WHICH IS. ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR PROJECTS ELECTION. A BETWEEN THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE COMMISSIONERS COMMISSION'S HEARING ON MY FIRST. TO MAKE A DECISION ON RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO REASONABLY ALLOW FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO DIGEST THE RECOMMENDATIONS AT PRESENT CLEAR IMPORTANT POINTS FOR THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER. FOR SOME OF US SOURCE REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL TWO WEEKS IN THAT WINDOW AND I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE QUEST. REQUEST GIVEN THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT DECISION THAT IS BEING MADE NINE COURAGE THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER THAT REQUEST. TO A CONCLUSION. I WOULD URGE YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE. SUPPORT AND PERHAPS BE A BIT PATIENT WITH THE WATER COMMISSION IN THEIR PROCESS AS THEY CARRY OUT THE LEGISLATURE'S AND THE PUBLIC'S MANDATE. ANOTHER PART YOU PROPONENTS ARE ANXIOUS TO GET A RESOLUTION AND IN SOME CASES MOVE FORWARD. CASES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR PROJECTS IN FACT WE ARE ALSO ANXIOUS. TO GET SOME OF THESE PROJECTS OPERATING SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN REALIZING THE PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT THEY OFFER. BUT THE QUICKEST OF THESE PROJECTS. SOME THE GROUNDWATER PROJECTS WILL TAKE FIVE YEARS. TO BE IMPLEMENTED UP TO FIVE YEARS TO BE IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THE SERVICE STORAGE PROJECTS TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS. AND SO AND WE'RE SPENDING TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. SO IF IT TAKES ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO EVEN IF THE SCHEDULE SLIPPED A LITTLE THIS IS ACCEPTABLE. WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT. I PUT CALIFORNIA'S WATER SYSTEM AND A TRAJECTORY TOWARD RESILIENCE. ALL THIS IS TO SAY. FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO STORAGE PROJECT FOR PUBLIC PUBLIC BENEFITS IS NEW AND IT'S TOUGH. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT. WE ALL HAVE FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE PROJECT WITH THE PROCESS. BUT LET'S BE PATIENT GET IT RIGHT. AND WE WILL ALL WATER USERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. BE BETTER OFF IF WE DO IT WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU BUT TO BOTH THE ALL FOUR OF YOU WHO LIVE. S. INITIATED THE DISCUSSION I KNOW MR AND SOLACE WANTED TO JUMP RIGHT IN. ASKING SOME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY APPRECIATE. EACH OF YOUR TESTIMONY ESPECIALLY THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT. EVEN WITH MY PREDECESSOR. A BIG PART OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS REMEMBERING ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS I THINK A LOT OF US. HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE WERE. FOUR OF THE TWENTY FOURTEEN BOND. BUT YOU KNOW I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK IN ONE OF THE THINK OF THE COMMISSION AS WELL FOR ALLOWING IT LEAVES ONE TWO THREE FOUR OF US. AT LEAST ON THIS DIETS WERE AT THE COMMISSION MEETING AND PROVIDED TESTIMONY. OF THEIR NAY AND I DON'T WANT TO REHASH EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID THERE I THINK IT WAS. PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WAS COMING FROM AND. AND THE REQUEST THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM OUR CONSTITUENCY KNOW OBVIOUSLY I THINK SEVERAL OF YOU GUYS HAVE MADE COMMENTS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE. THE INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS. ARE ISSUED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED ASK BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE APPLICANTS AND THE APPLICANTS BEING ABLE TO BE PROVIDED THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO CLARIFY THEIR APPLICATIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW NEARLY. ALL OF THE APPLICANTS. THAT APPLIED OF APPEALED. AND THAT. ITS BEEN VERY PUBLIC CAME AND THEIR SCORES AND AND WHAT NOT BUT YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD. YOU KNOW TODAY'S MARCH TWENTIETH AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE PILLS WILL BE ONLINE ON APRIL TWENTIETH SO OF A MONTH FROM NOW I BELIEVE IS IS PROCESS. THEY'RE ACTUALLY ONLINE NOW OKAY. AND THEN SO ON. SO RESPONSES TO THE PILLS WILL BE POSTED ONLINE ON APRIL TWENTIETH. SO BUT WITH THAT. WITH THAT SAID AND I REMEMBER AT THE COMMISSION MEETING IT WAS STATED THAT. COMMISSION STAFF WAS GOOD BE WORKING WITH THE APPLICANTS AND SIT DOWN WITH THEM TO GO OVER THESE A TO GO OVER THEIR APPEALS. BUT. SINCE THAT COMMISSION MEETING AND GIVEN THE APRIL TWENTIETH I BELIEVE IS THE NEXT BIG DEADLINE. ARE THERE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR. THOSE PEOPLE. BETTER FAR IN THIS APPEAL PROCESS. TWO WORK WITH COMMISSION STAFF OR TO REQUEST ON A NEED BASIS IF THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH STAFF TO GO OVER THOSE PARTS OF THEIR APPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT NOT BE CLEAR TO COMMISSION STAFF IN TERMS OF. OTHER PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO. LIKE YOU'VE JUST TO LOOK AT YOUR QUESTION TO ME JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT TO EVERYONE AND THAT IS THAT. WHEN WE OPEN THE APPLICATION PERIOD WHICH WAS FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS WE HAD OVER SIXTY STAFF AVAILABLE THAT ENTIRE TIME FROM FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES AND STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND THE STAFF THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH APPLICANTS WERE ALL THE SUBJECT AREA EXPERTS IT WILL BE DOING THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THE EVALUATIONS OF THESE. APPLICATIONS ARM. FOUR HAVE MONTHS THEY WERE THERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS PEOPLE WERE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS. COMPLEX APPLICATION PROJECTS PROCESS WHICH WE ALL ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZED. WHAT UP WHEN WE GOT THE APPEALS FROM THE APPLICANTS WE RECEIVED OVER NINE THOUSAND FILES AND UPDATE THEIR APPLICATIONS? WE POSTED ALL OF THOSE APPLICATIONS TWO DAYS AFTER RECEIVING THEM ALL OF THOSE ARE ONLINE ON THE WATER COMMISSION SITE NOW FOR INDIVIDUALS TAKE A LOOK AT. I WOULD HOPE THAT ANYONE WITH SPECIFIC INTEREST IN ANY SPECIFIC PROJECTS CAN GO AND JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE PRESENTING. ARM AND. PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT AS A COMMISSION. OPEN PLEASE IS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS WERE LISTENING VERY CAREFULLY TO EVERYBODY WHO'S PRESENTING TO ALL OF THE STAKE HOLDERS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. WHO ARE? FOCUSED ON THESE PROJECTS AND WE'RE LISTENING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS. I KEEP. THE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AND ALLOW EVERYBODY ACCESS AND. WHERE STE WHERE WE HAVE NOT MADE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT BUT WE'RE WATCHING YOU KNOW WHAT WERE ALL ANXIOUS TO GET THE NEW? PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIOS IN FRONT OF US AND MEAN THAT THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN ME YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAID. SHORTLY OR I WAS SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING TO ME ABOUT THIS EFFORT HAVE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO PUT IT. AND THAT WAS WHAT YOU GUYS DID WAS YOU HANDED THE HOMEWORK BACK AND SAID WE NEED. WE NEED TO HELP YOU WITH THIS AND WE WANT TO GET THE RIGHT ANSWERS BECAUSE WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS AND GET THE BEST ANSWERS POSSIBLE SO. I HAVE TO SAY THINK THAT OUR PROCESSES ITERATIVE AND WE REALLY WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL OF THIS WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO DO THAT GOT IT SO THAT YOU GIVEN THE HOMEWORK BACK. IF STUDENT OR THE APPLICANT HAS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND THEY CAN STILL WORK WITH COMMISSION STAFF ON A NEED BASIS WELL I THINK I I DON'T KNOW MY GUESS IS THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT EXCEPT THAT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HANDLE THAT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THE INFORMATION THAT COMES UP IN THAT END UP BECAUSE I HOPE. THAT IN THE APPEAL PROCESS AND I'VE LISTENED TO MOST OF THE MEETINGS WHICH WERE POSTED THEY'RE ALL AVAILABLE ONLINE THE ONE HOUR MEETINGS. AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IN SOME OF THEM YOU CAN WRITE AWAYS HERE RIGHT AWAY YOU HEAR THE PROJECT OPPONENTS SUBJECT AREA EXPERTS TALKING AND. ABSOLUTELY CONNECTING WITH THE STAFF FROM THESE THREE AGENCIES ARE GOOD OKAY NOW WE GET IT SO HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO IN THAT AND. IT'S LANGUAGE OF A LOT OF US TO UNDERSTAND BUT THERE'S CLEARLY CONNECTIONS THERE AND IT AND ACTUALLY I HAVE TO SAY THAT THOSE MEETINGS VARIED I THINK IN THEIR SUCCESS WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT GOES. AND IS THE COMMISSION STILL LOOKING TO OBLIGATE ALL THESE FUNDS BY THE SUMMER ALTHOUGH THE ONLY THING AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT WE CAN OBLIGATE THIS SUMMER IS THE EARLY FUNDING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT SOME OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION FOR THE PROJECTS. THAT'S IT WILL BE ABLE TO. TO DECIDE IT. JULY. AND IN JULY WILL ALSO BE DETERMINING THE MAXIMUM. CONDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY OF OF FUNDING SO. THAT MEANS. BASED ON THE SCORES THE PROJECT SCORES AND HOW THEY ARE RANKED AND. IN THE THREE DAY A. MEANING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE LIE WILL. BASED ON THAT INFORMATION. A. DETERMINE ALL I'LL SAY THAT THE CEILING OF THE FUNDING BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S CONDITION ALL AND IT'S BASED ON. THE APPLICANT'S COMPLETING. OF A. FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM CERTAIN DOCUMENTATION AND AT THAT IT'S REQUIRED IN THE BOND. GOT IT. OKAY AN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THAT NUMBER IS AT THIS POINT. THEY'LL HAVE TO COMPLETE THE EACH APPLICANT WHO. WHO HAS QUALIFIED FOR? THE VAN. IF OUR SORRY SIGIL ON TERM. THE MAXIMUM CONDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY A. DETERMINATION OF FUNDING. OF. THE FINAL WILL BE. DEPENDENT ON THEM COMPLETING ALL THE OTHER STEPS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN BONDS. SO IF I HAD THE. I'M SORRY. CUP COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS IF IF I HAD THAT CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY VERY INTERESTED IN WATER POLICY IN MY AND MY PART OF THE DISTRICT. AND IF THEY WERE TO ASK ME SO WHEN DO WE ANTICIPATE THIS TWO POINT SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS OF CHAPTER EIGHT MONEY TO BE FULLY ALLOCATED WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD RESPONSE WHEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVES THE ASSURANCES AND DOCUMENTATION. THAT. GIVES US THE CONFIDENCE TO. TWO AND LET THE MONEY THERE TO. DIRECT MONEY TO THE PROJECT. SO WE'LL BE DOING GO GO AHEAD YEAH NOT SO THAT WOULD MEAN THEN NOT. NECESSARILY THE SUMMER BUT HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR I MEAN OR WHAT WHAT'S THE GOAL THAT THE COMMISSION AND EVERYONE IS WORKING TOWARDS TO ACTUALLY. OBLIGATE THE TWO POINT SEVEN SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE IT START GOING TOWARDS PROJECTS AND AND THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN CAN POINT TO AND SAY THAT'S BEING DONE. I HOPE THAT COULD IT GO HIT CARE. I THINK THAT. THAT THAT MAY VERY. A PENDING UPON THE PROJECT. YOU KNOW EACH PROJECT HAS THEIR OWN TIMELINE RIGHT. SO. OF I THINK OF. WHAT WHAT ONE THING IT THOUGH IS AS I INDICATED BEFORE THAT? THAT FOR THESE PROJECTS THAT HAVE LONG. PRE CONSTRUCTION. TIMELINES. THEY NEED TO COMPLETE. CERTAIN ELEMENTS. OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE DEEMED. A CERTAIN DOCUMENTS OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE DEEMED INELIGIBLE BY JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. AND THAT'S STATED IN THE BOND NO. YET EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE PROGRESS BEING MADE ON ON WHAT IS BEING ALLOCATED. YET IT'S EASIER FOR ME TO GO BACK TO TALK TO. FOLKS AND SAY OKAY. OF THE TWO POINT SEVEN THESE ARE THE PROJECTS I GOT PICKED THIS IS WHAT'S BEING DONE. OBVIOUSLY IF NO PROGRESS IS BEING MADE THEN YOU REEVALUATE THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO USEFUL FOR I KNOW FOR MYSELF AND PROBABLY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO GO BACK AND SAY. OKAY THIS IS WHAT'S BEING DONE THIS IS THE TIMELINE THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE WORKING TOWARDS YOU KNOW GIVEN EVERYBODY. A PLATE SO PROCESS AND TURNS THAN OTHER PEOPLE WORKERS THEIR HOMEWORK USING YOUR ANALOGY. SHOWING THEIR WORK. A SO SO TO SPEAK THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN POINT TO AND SAY THIS IS THE GOAL OF THIS IS WHAT'S BEING DONE AS OPPOSED TO. YOU KNOW I GET A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED AT NOT A SURLY WITH WHAT. WITH ANSWERING THE COMMISSION HERE BUT ALSO WITH OTHER AGENCIES IN THIS SAY OKAY IT'S ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE BUREAUCRACY AND. NOTHING'S BEING DONE WE PASS THIS YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO IN. YOU KNOW HOW HOW CAN WE SEE THE SIX COME TO FRUITION. AND SO. WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL IN AND GETTING THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR MYSELF AND. PROBABLY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL. I AM OMIT MENTION OF A MISTER HALL MENTIONED IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT THIS BEING A NEW PROGRAM IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY. AND SO WE'VE CUT SUBJECT AREA EXPERTS FROM FISH AND WILDLIFE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD NDW ARE WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST BECAUSE AS YOU SAID. MAURICE. NEED OF THIS IS CARBON A NEW PATH FORWARD AND AND SO IT IS TAKING I THINK MORE WORK THAN WHAT WE ALL EXPECTED BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY CRITICAL I THINK IN TERMS OF. OF. GOING. I THINK FUTURE PROCESSES HOPEFULLY WE'LL LEARN WE WILL LEARN A LOT IN THIS PROCESS AND MAKE FUTURE PROCESS SMOOTHER. YOU KNOW AND. AND I THINK OF IT ALSO IS AYE ICE SERVICE ELECTED MEMBER OF A BORDER OF WATER PROGRESS LIVE. AND IF WE WERE TO BUILD OUR OWN WATER STORAGE PROJECT WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO MEET STATE REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF DOWNSTREAM ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. AND SO. OUTSIDE OF OF THESE FUNDS ANYBODY WHO'S DOING A WATER STORAGE PROJECT HAS TO COMPLY WITH THESE SORTS OF CONDITIONS. BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE INVESTING IN THAT PART OF THE PROJECT THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS. THIS WHOLE PACKAGE TO IS THAT IF IF ANY OF YOU WERE UP THE IN IF YOU SERVED ON A IF YOU WERE PART OF A A WATER UTILITY. WE'RE GONNA BUILD WATER STORAGE YOUR CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE WHOLE THING. INCLUDING THAT DOWNSTREAM. BENEFIT THAT YOU WOULD BE STORY IN THIS CASE IT'S THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S GONNA STEPPED IN AS A PARTNER AND OFFSET THAT PART OF THE COST THEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO BELIEVE ME THAT DAY AND WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE OUR ABILITY. TO PORT THESE PROJECTS THAT NON I APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THE WATER COMMISSION HEARING MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN HELPING. CORRECT THE SHIP I GUESS SO TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF. MAKE SURE THAT THE APPLICANTS WERE HEARD THAT PROCESS IS ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD AND SO. I DO APPRECIATE THAT IT AND YOU TAKE IN OUR TESTIMONY INTO ACCOUNT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT AS WELL. YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW. YOU JUST MENTIONED AND MISTER HART TALKED ABOUT IT TO THAT EVEN ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SEVENTY ONE DIDN'T HAVE SPECIFIC EARMARKS IN TERMS OF. PACIFIC PROJECTS I KNOW IN THE CHAPTER EIGHT LANGUAGE WE DID. OUTLINE AND WE DID REFERENCE I THE CAL FED DATA BAY DELTA PROGRAM RECORD OF DECISION. I DATED AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH. AND SO IN A CHAPTER EIGHT ADULTS AND PROVISION A SECTION TWO SEVEN NINETY SEVEN POINT ONE PAGE TWENTY TWO. SO I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE LOST AS WELL. AND I THINK I'VE SAID THE COMMISSION UNDER. AS SUCH THANK YOU THINK YOU SAW US I I THINK THAT THE QUESTION YOU ASK. ABOUT TIME LINES ISN'T UP A HYPOTHETICAL ONE IT IT'S A REAL QUESTION THAT. THAT WAS JUST ASKED OF ME BY THE MEDIA RIGHT FOR YEARS. IN THE MAKING CLEARLY. IT IS A NEW. ARENA THAT THAT WE ARE WORKING IN BUT. I THINK. HIGHER LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY IN. ALLOWS FOR INSIGHT TO BOTH THE PROCESS IN THE PROGRESS. AND WHY WITHOUT A DOUBT THE INCLUSIVENESS OF STAKEHOLDERS I THINK. MINIMIZES THE LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION AND ANXIETY RITE OF. ALONG THIS IS BAD TAKEN I KNOW OF MISA TALK THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO ADD TO THAT YES I WANNA GO BACK VQ TO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOLACE FIRST QUESTION YOU WERE NOTING THAT THE RESPONSES TO THE APPEALS WOULD BE ONLINE ON APRIL TWENTIETH IS THE SCHEDULE FOR THAT. YOU WERE ASKING WOULD THERE BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INTERACTION ARE ABOUT. AND. I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION THE BECAUSE OF THE ORIGINAL DISCONNECT BE. ALONE WE WERE SO GLAD THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR APPEALS AND NOW AS WAS MENTIONED A LOT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND THE REVIEWERS ARE REVIEWING THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SO WE THINK ONE OF THE FUTURE INTERACTIONS THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS REGARDING THAT. NEW INFORMATION THAT'S COME IN AND WE ARE SUGGESTING THAT THERE BE A MEETING IN EARLY APRIL ON FOR THAT PURPOSE AND I THINK I THINK. I KNOW THAT THE COMMISSION AND THE STAFF ARE LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE RIGHT PROCESS WE APPRECIATE THEM LOOKING AT THAT BUT THAT'S ONE OF THOSE INTERACTIONS THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE. THE OF THE FINAL ON DECISIONS ON THE PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIOS ARE POSTED AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT FACT THAT COMMENT I BELIEVE I JUST HEARD FROM THE COMMISSION TO THAT THEY WERE GOING TO ALLOW THAT ON THE NEED BAY SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN'T CONNECT MAYBE BEFORE THE APRIL. TWENTIETH SO IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED ARE CLARIFIED THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT IS A. CORRECT YOU KNOW WHAT I MAY BE BACK TO CORRECTLY IF IT'S OKAY I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER JOE YOUNG UP TO TALK ABOUT THIS AS WELL BECAUSE HE LISA EATEN DAY TO DAY MANAGEMENT OF STAFF ON. RIGHT. MORNING MY NAME'S JOEY ON THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION. SO THERE'S SCRIPT TO QUESTIONS THAT SEEM TO BE GOING AROUND THAT I WANTED TO FIRST AND GO BACK AND MAYBE ADDRESS THE. MEMBERS ALICE'S QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT'S THE TIMELINE IN WHAT WHAT CAN WHEN CAN WE TELL PEOPLE WHAT IS HAPPENING. SO THAT THE WAY THE STATUTE IS WRITTEN. THE COMMISSION CANNOT ALLOCATE FUNDS EXCEPT FOR THE EARLY FUNDING AND TELL ALL THE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET IN SEVEN AND SEVEN FIVE ONE. AND SO THAT PRESENTED A PROBLEM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE IT PUTS YOU ON IN IN A LITTLE BIT OF A DO LOOP THEY CAN'T GET THERE ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND SEVEN NINE SEVEN FIVE ONE IS A HUNDRED PERCENT COMMITMENT FOR THE NON PROGRAM FUNDING. AND SO INTEL FOLKS UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STATE WOULD MIGHT BE ABLE TO COMMIT IT'S HARD TO GO DO THAT. AND SO IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM WHAT WE DID IS WE CREATED THIS AWFUL TERM. MAXIM CONDITIONALS ABILITY DETERMINATION WHICH IS REALLY IT PUT PRELIMINARY COMMITMENT TO PLAN A DECISION BY THE COMMISSION IN JULY. TO SAY GETTING ALL YOUR REQUIREMENTS TOGETHER IS THIS SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO BUT HERE IS WHAT WE WOULD BE WILLING TO COMMIT SHOULD YOU GO DO THAT SO THAT ALLOWS THE APPLICANTS THEN TO ENTER INTO. INTO A BETTER SELF PACED. TIME PERIOD WHEN THEY CAN GET ALL THOSE. REQUIREMENTS DONE AND THEN COME BACK TO THE COMMISSION FOR THE FINAL WORD SO IN JULY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT THE COMMISSION WILL BE MAKING THOSE PRELIMINARY DETERMINATIONS AND SO AT THAT POINT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PROJECTS WOULD BE A HAVE WHICH FUNDING AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT THEY NEED TO GO BACK AND DO THE THINGS THAT THAT THE STATUTE REQUIRED THEM TO DO FIRST. AND COMMISSION STAFF WILL BE WORKING WITH THEM TO TO CLARIFY THAT. RIGHT SO AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS THEY WILL BE THEY WILL HAVE TO COME BACK AYE AFTER JULY FIRST OR GIVE THE COMMISSION THE. PROGRESS REPORTS OF SO THAT THE COMMISSION UNDERSTANDS THAT WHAT PROGRESS THEY'RE MAKING IN THE COMMISSION HAS THE DISCRETION TO SAY IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK OUT. PERMIT THE WATER RIGHT WHATEVER. THAT THE COMMISSION CAN SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA CHANGE YOUR MIND ANY TO GO FARTHER DOWN THE LIST SIR JOHN TAKE AS MANY BASS OF INDIRECT RESPONSE TO WHAT MISS TACK HELPED OUTLINE. WILL APPLICANTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN CRAPS EARLY APRIL TO WORK WITH COMMISSION ON THIS SO THEN TO GO BACK INTO THE QUESTION THAT THAT THE. CITY TOOK WAS WAS TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT ARE THE INTERACTIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE HAVING WITH APPLICANTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE'VE WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD. A LOT ABOUT WANTING TO HAVE THOSE INTERACTIONS I'M SUPPOSED BE TALKING TO THE COMMISSION TOMORROW AT THE MEETING ABOUT WHAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE. IT'S VERY I THINK THE PRE APRIL TWENTIETH A SUGGESTION THAT APPLICANTS HAVE MADE. CREATE SOME PROBLEM FOR US IN TERMS OF OF WHAT I CALL PLIGHT FAIRNESS. I THINK WHAT EVERYONE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN TERMS OF THE FAIRNESS THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND THEREFORE IT BE A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO EVERYONE THAT WISHES TO PURSUE IT. PICNIC WE CAN OFFER IT EIGHT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO COME IN ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS THAT'S TRUE I THINK. THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE PRE TWENTIETH MEETING. IS. THE INTERACTION THAT EVERYBODY LIKED SO MUCH WAS AFTER WE HAD A PUBLIC DOCUMENT RELEASED IN FEBRUARY WHEN WE COULD TALK ABOUT. WHAT THE STAFF HAD DONE YEAH? WHAT IT DIFFICULT PROBLEMATIC FOR US BECAUSE NEARLY ALL OF THE APPLICANTS NOW GONE TO APPEAL AND EVERYBODY WAS UPSET BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T CLEAR ON THE PROCESS AND SO? YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING AGAINST UP HERE. SO THE DID WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE APPLICANT SIDE IS THAT. THEY WOULD LIKE. STAFF TO ASK THEM CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR THE TWENTY OF. SO IF STAFF ASKED ONE APPLICANT A CLARIFYING QUESTION AND HAS NO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF THE OTHER APPLICANTS. AND THEN THE ALL THE OTHER APPLICANTS DO WORSE ORG. THAN THE ONE THEY ASKED THE QUESTION TWO IS THAT IT IS THAT. IS THAT FAIR TO ALL APPLICANTS SOME ALMOST STUCK IN THAT PLACE OF SAYING HOW DO I ASK QUESTIONS OF EVERYBODY IF I DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS OF EVERYBODY AND IS IT FAIR FIREHOUSES QUESTIONS. WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE OUTCOME FROM THE STAFF REVIEW AND SO WE CAN RAISE SOME UNFAIRNESS QUESTIONS. ARE SOME. UNFAIRNESS ISSUES WITH THAT RUBRIC AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF WHEN IS IT TIME TO TO ALLOW FOLKS TO COME IN AND WHEN DO WE HAVE. THE DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK IT'S EASIER FROM THE COMMISSION SIDE. TO BE ABLE TO BE ASK QUESTIONS BY APPLICANTS BY STAKEHOLDERS AND US TO EXPLAIN. WHAT STAFF IS DOING? MY ABILITY TO DO THAT BEFORE I RELEASE A PUBLIC DOCUMENT IS VERY LIMITED. IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE MOVING UP MY RELEASE DATE. AND SO THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH. AND I WOULD LIKE TO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A A. A MEETING. AND INTERACTION. SHORTLY AFTER THE TWENTIETH NOT BEFORE TO PREPARE FOLKS FROM WHAT THEY MAY BE COMING INTO THE COMMISSION TO TALK ABOUT WHERE THE DECISIONS CAN BE REALLY MADE. THAT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE YEAH AND AND YOU KNOW AND FROM YOU KNOW MY STEP POINT I'M JUST IF EVERYONE'S GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TO. TO SIT DOWN WITH STAFF. THAT'S AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO EVERYONE TO ME THAT SEEMS. SEEMS FAIR BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY I WANT EVERY APPLICANT TO FILL THAT THEY HAD EVERY TOOL AVAILABLE TO THEM. TO MAKE THE STRONGEST APPLICATION THAT THEY CAN MAKE. MOVING FORWARD SO. NO MATTER HOW THE COMMISSION DECIDES TO DO THE AWARDS. AT THE END OF. THE END OF THE SUMMER AND THE AND THE YEARS CONTINUES TO PROGRESS. EVERYONE AT LEAST BILLS THAT. THEY HAD THE DUE PROCESS. THEY HAD ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY COULD A PROVIDED TO IT HAVE THE STRONGEST APPLICATION MOVING FORWARD. AND SO. I'D LIKE. I WOULD THINK YOU'D BE. IT WOULD BEHOOVE THE COMMISSION I THINK JUST TO HAVE PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO THE APPLE CANCEL THE CAN FILL THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE STRONGEST. APPLICATION UNDER THE CRITERIA THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE OPPORTUNITIES TASSELS QUESTIONS AS WE CONTINUE TO PROGRESS. AND SO THAT'S WHY I WAS THINKING AND YOU KNOW AS OUTLINED THINK MISTOOK. FOR THE APRIL TWENTIETH AND THAT'S A PART OF THAT PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. IN A OF APPRECIATE THE THE SUGGESTIONS AND I THINK WE ARE WE ONLY TO LOOK AT PURPOSE OF THE MEETING AND HOW THAT WOULD THAT BE RUN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S FAIR AND IT IS HELPFUL. TOOK TAL PARTIES THEN THAT'S REALLY WHERE WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THIS AND COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT WE THINK MAKES MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU MISTER SOLACE WE HAVE A A NUMBER OF FOLKS ONE ASK QUESTIONS GALLAGHER FOLLOWED BY MISTER BIGELOW MISS LEVINE. IMAGE RUBIO. I WAS. FIRST WHY DO YOU WANT TO THANK ED THE COMMISSIONERS. FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND AND AS I SAID WHEN WE IT WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU THAT. YOUR PUBLIC HEARING I I APPRECIATE ALL THE THE HARD WORK THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS PROCESS. AND AND YOU KNOW HOW SERIOUSLY YOU'VE TAKEN EVEN YOU KNOW. COMING OUT OF PUBLIC MEETINGS UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND TO HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW SOME OF THEIR VERY REAL CONCERNS ABOUT WATER SUSTAINABILITY WATER RELIABILITY. AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS RIGHT. AND I'VE HEARD THAT SEVERAL TIMES. FROM PEOPLE HERE SO I I APPRECIATE THAT. A YOU KNOW THAT THAT CONCERN AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS HAS BEEN THERE. MIGHT MY CONCERNS REALLY REALLY RELY AROUND AND. ENSURING THAT THE STATUTE THAT WAS PASSED. AND THE BOND THAT WAS VOTED ON AND PASSED BY THE VOTERS. THAT IS IS TRUTH IS IS TRULY AND ACCURATELY CARRIED OUT. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE AND. I THINK WHAT I'LL START BY IS BECAUSE I STILL DON'T FEEL I'VE HEARD A COMMITMENT. AND I WANT TO HEAR COMMITMENT THAT BETWEEN. THE DATE OF THIS HEARING. AND APRIL TWENTIETH WHEN THE REVIEWERS COME BACK WITH THEIR RESPONSES THERE WILL BE A MEETING. WITH THE STAFF AND THE APPLICANT. AT A ONE IS NOT A SUGGESTION. IT'S. WILL THERE BE A MEETING WITH APPLICANTS SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND. AND THEN THEY HAD THAT MEETING PRIOR TO THE APRIL TWENTIETH COMING BACK. IS IT GOING TO BE ONE OR NOT. YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE THIS AYE FROM THIS COMMITTEE I WANT TO HEAR THAT THERE WILL BE. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. I DON'T KNOW WITH THE SCORES ARE GOING TO BE COME A NO I'M NOT ASKING FOR THE SCORE TO A NO THERE WILL BE A MEETING. WITH THE APPLICANTS PRIOR TO. THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE COMING BACK. BUT ARE WE HAVE A COMMISSION MEETING TOMORROW WHEN THE ENTIRE COMMISSION WILL BE TOGETHER BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW. NOW I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL MY FELLOW COMMISSION MEMBERS AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT AS A COMMISSION. AND TAKE THAT QUESTION VERY SERIOUSLY DON'T HAS BEEN. AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH THEIR EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND STAFF AROUND THIS AND SO. WITHOUT. WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS ARE THE VOICES OF MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS I DON'T. FEEL LIKE I CAN. ANSWER THAT. COMPLETE BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BELIEVE ME WE HEAR IT. RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN EMPHASIZE MANY TIMES SO I JUST. WELL THE SYNTHESIZER GUINNESS THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN I THINK IT CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT'S TRANSPARENT AND ALL THOSE THINGS EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED ABOUT BUT THERE NEEDS TO HAVE THAT MEANS EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHERE THEY'RE AT AND WHAT OTHER INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PROVIDE. PRIOR TO THESE OFFICIAL RESPONSES COMING BACK ON APRIL TWENTIETH. NOW I'M NOT GO TO MY SECOND PART IS MY ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS HERE IS THAT I THINK WERE A LOT OF THIS FRUSTRATION IS COMING FROM. IS THAT ATTORNEYS AND STAFF. TO ME. MAY BE SORT OF HIJACKING THIS PROCESS A LITTLE BIT. I AM AND. YOU KNOW THAT. NO THEY NEED TO BE TRUE TO WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS AND WHAT THE REGULATIONS SAY. AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ALSO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING ON THESE AT THE APPLICANTS AND THE TEAMS THAT ARE PART OF THESE APPLICATIONS. ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS THEIR PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE STUFF AND I PROVIDING VERY DETAILED. INFORMATION AND DATA. AND. INTO AND WHAT I'M HEARING IS IS THAT IN SOME CASES THEY'RE KINDA BE MET WITH THE BLOCKADE. AT THE STAFF LEVEL SAY NO THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ACCURATE. EVEN EVEN ONE EXAMPLE BEING THE EARLY ON STAFF SAYING YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER A SMALLER PROJECT. WELL THAT'S NOT THERE THAT'S NOT THEIR DETERMINATION. TO MAKE ABOUT WHETHER WHAT THE APPLICATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND YOU KNOW THE AND PROJECTS SHOULD BE. THERE IS TO TRULY AND ACCURATELY APPLY THESE THE STATUTE IN THIS LANGUAGE. TO THE APPLICATION. YOU KNOW DOES IT MEET THESE THINGS IS THAT ONE OF THESE FIVE THAT. FOR CRITERIAS A CALVET PROJECT THERE'S A REASON WE CALLED UP THE CAL FED PROJECTS. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN STUDIED FOR YEARS AND EVERYBODY IS IDENTIFIED THEM AS BEING NEED RIGHT. WHO ALSO CALLED UP GROUND WATER PROJECTS WE ALSO CON CALLED OUT REGIONAL PROJECTS THAT HAVE? THE PUBLIC BENEFITS RIGHT. THE PROJECT PASSED HAVE MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DELTA. PERIOD. THAT'S GONNA ACTUALLY THAT'S A HARD THING FOR GROUND WATER PROJECTS TO MEET. BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD A WHOLE LOT OF PUSH BACK ON THAT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ACCURATELY. AND TRULY CARRIED OUT IT HAS TO HAVE A NET IMPROVEMENT. TO THE ECOSYSTEM THAT DOESN'T MEAN WHAT SOMEBODY WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. NO AND OVER ABOUT THAT NET BUT ACTUALLY WHAT IS THE EXISTING CONDITIONS OUT THERE TODAY. YOU KNOW AND DOES IT PROVIDE A NET IMPROVEMENT TO THOSE THAT'S BEING VERY CLEARLY SPELLED OUT ITS IN THE STATUTES IN THE REGULATIONS. BUT I'M STILL HEARING OF STAFF SAYING. THINGS LIKE WELL NO WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT REALLY YOU KNOW MEETS OVER AND ABOVE THE STANDARD THAT WE WANT TO PRY AND THERE'S EVEN MAY BE MOVING SAID I'M HEARING THAT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE. IS THAT THERE'S THERE'S ALMOST A A MOVING STANDARD AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES. NO NOT IMPROVEMENTS IN AND ALL THAT GOES TO. I THINK YOUR JOB WHICH IS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY. YOU HAVE TO. ENSURE THAT THE STAFF AND THE ATTORNEYS AND WHOEVER'S LOOKING AT THIS. ARE ACCURATELY INTERPRETING THIS STATUTE AND APPLYING IT. FAIRLY AND TRULY TO THE PROJECTS. AND SO THAT'S ME ON MY. NO HAVE YOU HAD SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS HAVE. WELL OUTLINE BECAUSE THERE'S A TRANSPARENCY ON THE OTHER SIDE TO. THERE'S A TRANSPARENCY FROM THE APPLICANT THAT ALSO WANT TO SEE TRANSPARENCY ON THE STAFF SIDE. AND MAYBE SOME OF THE. IN THEIR PREJUDICES PREJUDICES ARE BIASES THAT THEY'RE BRINGING. TO THE TABLE AS WELL AND THAT THAT IT IS IT'S NOT LIKE PUBLIC. AS EMPLOYEES AND AND PEOPLE WHO ARE REVIEWING THIS DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN. BIASES IN MAY BE TALKING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS AS WELL. THAT AREN'T APPLICANTS BUT THEY'RE DEATHLY HAVE AN AGENDA. AND NO TO ME THAT'S A CONCERN SO I MEAN IS IS THAT MAYBE MAY IF YOU CAN ADDRESS. IS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT HAVE OF I'M NOT RAISE A COUPLE DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE BUT MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE. YOU KNOW A COUPLE THINGS ONE OF THEM IS DURING ITS READING MEETINGS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL THE OTHER AGENCIES THERE THAT ARE DOING THE EVALUATION SO THAT THEY CAN. PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS WITH APPLICANTS AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THOSE THINGS ARE GOING. I KNOW THE I AM NOT. I'VE LOOKED AT ALL THE REVIEWS. AND A LOT OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN OR MET MUCH OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN HAS BEEN. A DISCONNECT IN TERMS OF DEFINITIONS AND OUTCOMES AND IT WILL GIVE YOU YOU KNOW AN EXAMPLE. THAT. DO YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. SOMEBODY SAID DO YOU KNOW PER APPROACH PROPONENTS IS THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE BENEFITS FOR FISH BY PROVIDING COLD WATER FOR SO MANY DAYS. WHAT TURNS OUT THAT? AND I'M GONNA USE A FICTITIOUS NUMBER HERE BUT LET'S SAY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE COLD WATER THEIR PROJECT WILL PROVIDE COLD WATER FOR THIRTY DAYS. BUT WHAT FISH AND WILDLIFE NEEDS ACTUALLY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF FISHES. SIXTY DAYS AND SO THEN THERE'S A NEGOTIATION THEIR OF SO HOW DO WE DO THIS AND SO THAT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP. AND ALSO. WHEN THE APPLICATION OUT WHEN REGULATIONS WERE PUT TOGETHER THEY WERE PRETTY CLEAR. I'M IS PRETTY CLEAR GUIDANCE IN THE REGULATIONS IN TERMS OF MODELS IT NEEDED TO BE USED UP CLIMATE. CLIMATE IMPACTS AND THOSE WERE USED IT FAIRLY DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW THE APPLICATIONS AND SO PART OF WHAT'S HAPPENED. IS THE. I THINK THAT THE. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE ALREADY HELD WITH THE PROJECT APPLICANTS WERE SIGNIFICANT. AND THEY WENT THROUGH A LOT OF THOSE SORTS OF MISS YOU KNOW MISSED UNDERSTANDINGS. ARE OPEN AND. TO. AGAIN WE. I M. CONFIT WITH THE STAFF THAT HAS BEEN THE STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY UP PRESSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING I KNOW THAT THE. INTO THE DIRECTOR OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN HIS COVER LETTER FOR THEIR EVALUATIONS IS VERY CLEAR THAT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT. WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE GOING TO BE THEY CAN ONLY REACT TO THE INFORMATION THEY'RE BEING GIVEN? AND WITH THE. THEY'RE APPLYING THE STANDARDS THAT ARE UNDERSTOOD IN THE IN THOSE INDUSTRIES AND SO. YOU KNOW I I I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT. YOU KNOW THAT SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS ON BEFORE APRIL TWENTIETH. RIGHT WELL I GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST AND WITH IS OKAY I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT MEAN HAPPENS BEFORE THE TWENTIETH SO THAT WE MAY. SO ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARE CLEARED UP THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OFFICIAL MEETING. AND THEN. BUT WHAT I WOULD DISTRESS TO THE COMMISSION IS IT LOOK THIS HAS BEEN PLACED IN YOUR HANDS AND REALLY IN YOUR HANDS ALONE. TO MAKE THESE ULTIMATE DETERMINATIONS. AND. AS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE STATUE YOU CAN LOOK AT THESE RAGS AND WHAT I WHAT I THINK IS SOMETIMES HAPPENING IS JUST A DIFFERENCE IN OPINION. A ABOUT WHAT THAT WHAT THAT MEANS IN ANY SAY THEY'RE THEY'RE APPLYING STANDARDS WILL. THE PROBLEM IS SOMETIMES THE STANDARDS CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO. AND. AND SOMETIMES THEY MIGHT BE APPLYING A STANDARD THAT. SOMEONE ELSE IS ALSO VERY WELL VERSED IN THIS DISAGREES WITH YOU KNOW AND SAYS NOW LOOK AT THE DATA. WE CAN SHOW YOU THAT THIS SUCH AND SUCH AS COLD WATER ACTUALLY DOES HELP FISH. YOU KNOW AND IS IT JUST THAT HEY EFFICIENT WILDLIFE SAYS NO THAT'S JUST THE BOTTOM LINE. YOU KNOW AND EVEN IF THERE IS DATA THAT SHOWS IT'S NOT SO. WE I MEAN THAT CAN'T BE THE ANSWER IS THAT JUST THEIR THE END ALL BE ALL. ULTIMATELY I THINK WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE YOU IS YOU MAKE THE DECISION. YOUR COMMISSION MAKES THAT DECISION AND SAYS NO. WE'VE SEEN THE DATA WE SEEM WITH THE SAP COMMITS SIN IS SUBMITTING AND WE AGREE THAT IT MEETS THE CRITERIA OUTLINED IN HERE CRITERIA THAT WE ALL HELP SET UP. AND THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO IMPLEMENT RIGHT. I JUST DON'T WANT BE THE OPINION OF SOME WELL. PUT SOME STAFF PERSON AND THAT IS THE END ALL BE ALL AND IT'S NOT ULTIMATELY THE COMMISSION'S DECISION. NO AT ON SOME THESE ITEMS BECAUSE I'M JUST HEARING THAT THERE'S SOME. THERE IS SOME OF. THERE IS SOME DISPUTE WELL AS SOME OF THESE THINGS. REASONABLE DISPUTE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALSO WOULD WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT IS THAT THE SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS WITH THE COMMISSION. AND THE PROJECT OPPONENTS AND. IN MAY JUNE AND JULY WILL INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL OF THESE AGENCIES IN THE COMBAT THAT'S THE POINT AT WHICH THE COMMISSION IS GONNA BE ABLE TO ASK. AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES AND SCIENTISTS LIKE WAIT A MINUTE HOW DID YOU DO THAT AND SO DID THE COMMISSION'S JOB TO REALLY DELVE INTO THOSE THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP IN THE PUBLIC FORUM. ON EACH OF THESE ELEMENTS BECAUSE ITS NOT A SITUATION WHERE THE COMMISSION IS JUST GOING TO ACCEPT. SCORES AS THEY ARE HANDED TO US BY STAFF. SO THAT IS GOING TO BE CONTINUING DISCUSSION UP THROUGH AN UNTIL JULY. AS WE COME UP WITH THE WITH THE FINAL DETERMINATIONS AT THAT POINT. THANK YOU WAS GALLAGHER. I THINK I AYE ARE BE RECOMMENDING TO THIS COMMITTEE. THAT THAT WE DRAFT THE LETTER TO THE COMMISSION. PERHAPS EVEN FOR TOMORROW'S MEETING AT RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING. OF THE. POTENTIAL GATHERING. A PRIOR TO THE APRIL TWENTIETH A AND HOPEFULLY THAT WOULD THAT BE TAKEN TO SEARS CONSIDERATION BY THE ENTIRE COMMISSION. AND I THINK THAT AMONGST THE STAKEHOLDERS CAN DETERMINE HOW BEST TO A STRUCTURE. THAT CONVERSATION WITHOUT THE LEADING TO ANY AB. UNFAIRNESS OR YOU KNOW HINDERING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF YOU KNOW. I YEAR SCORING. BUT THAT CERTAINLY THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO WELCOMED THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO SIGN ON. TO THAT LETTER THAT WILL BE SENDING TO THE COMMISSION. NEXT A MISTER. A BIGELOW FOLLOWED BY MISS LEVINE AND THAT MRS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN YES I'D BE WILLING TO SIGN ON TO THAT LETTER I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT. FACTOR. AGAIN THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE. PRESENTERS HERE TODAY. TAKING TIME TO COME HERE AND SHARE WITH US YOUR. YOUR UNDERSTANDINGS IN YOUR THINKING. I THINK. AT WORST LISTENING HERE WERE LEARNING. I LOT MORE ABOUT THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WHAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING. I THINK THE REAL CRUX OF THE ISSUE LEAST I'M TAKING AWAY RIGHT NOW. IS THERE'S BEEN A. WELL OPEN DIALOGUE. AND INFORMATION SOMEWHAT GOING BACK AND FORTH THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCONNECT. I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THAT. PEOPLE SITTING ON THE COMMISSION SIDE. AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE APPLICANTS. WE'RE SO FAR APART. I FIND IT HARD. TO UNDERSTAND WHEN. JUST USING ONE PROJECT OUT THERE THAT SAYS. FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED. IT WILL RETURN A PUBLIC BENEFIT OF TWO DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SIX THAT. BUT ESCORTED ZERO. WHAT INFORMATION? WAS LACKING. SO I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE. MAYBE ALL THE INFORMATION. WASN'T FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYBODY. BECAUSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WAS SPENT. MILLIONS. GETTING APPLICATIONS. ROCK PORT ONLY SCORED ZERO. EXPERTS ON BOTH SIDE CAN'T BE THAT FAR APART. SO I I ACTUALLY COME BACK TO WHAT MR SOLVES IS SAYING WHAT MR GALLAGHER SAYING. I THINK THERE'D THAT DOES NEED TO BE A WINDOW AND I UNDERSTAND. WHY MR YA? THAT. HE WANTED SILOS SO IT WAS A FAIRNESS ISSUE. BUT HIS SYSTEM OR THE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT. I SOMEHOW BROKE DOWN. SO THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING PROJECTS AS. WELL PRESENTED AND SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. THE HAVE ACROSS THE BOARD ZEROS. SAYS IT WAS BAD INFORMATION OUT AND THAT INFORMATION IS. WE START WITH THAT INFORMATION. YOU'RE GONNA END WITH THAT INFORMATION. I WILL BE CONSISTENT. SO WE'VE GOT A FIX THAT I THINK THAT'S INCOME BUT UPON THE COMMISSION. TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY. WON'T ALLEY. WE HAD A PROBLEM. AND WE CAN FIX IT. I THINK YOU AS A BODY CAN STEP UP YOUR STAFF. AND SAY LOOK. YOU NEED TO WORK WITH THESE FOLKS. SHE GALLAGHER WANTS A COMMITMENT I THINK LETTER NOW FROM THE CHAIRMAN IT'S GOING TO BE ASKING FOR. FOR THAT. THEN AND I'M SUPPORTIVE THAT. IS IT POSSIBLE. FOR US TO HEAR SOME. SOME TAILORED DID POINT THAT SAYS. YEAH WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT GIVING AN OPEN. OPPORTUNITY FOR APPLICANTS. STAFF TO GET MORE CLARIFYING INFORMATION. SO THAT'S PROJECTS CAN BE LOOKED. NOT IN A PARTISAN WAY WITH FAVORITISM BUT WITH AN AYE OF. TRUE BREATH OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT EACH WAS SAYING AND MOUNT. A POSSIBLE TO HAVE THAT. SO AS MISTER HALL WAS SAYING. YOU COULD HAVE A SUCCESSFUL AND WELL PRESENTED PROJECT. CAN WE DO THAT. THAT'S A QUESTION SOME YOU KNOW I'LL ó SAY THAT. DURING THE APPLICATION PERIOD AND AS ONE AND JUST PUT THIS IS A ONE OF THE TENT STAKES AND THAT IS DURING THE APPLICATION PERIOD JUST FOR HAVE MONTHS ALL OF THESE SUBJECT AREA EXPERTS WERE AVAILABLE FOR STAFF I MEAN WERE AVAILABLE FOR APPLICANTS. AND THAT. I THINK THAT COULD HAVE BEEN. TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF MEN A MUCH BETTER WAY THAN IT WAS AND THAT WAS PART BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEXITY WE WERE DEALING WITH THEM IN IN THE TWO YEARS OF HEARINGS THAT WE HAD AND DEVELOPING THE REGULATIONS. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION OVER KEY POINTS THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE REGULATIONS. SO WAS CLEAR THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE THE NEED FOR. CLEAR COMMUNICATION THAT'S PART OF WHY THE APPLICATION PERIOD WAS SO LONG AND SO. BE DEAFENING WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS TOMORROW IS WAS WHAT I CAN SAY AND THAT AND IT IS THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN. WHICH YOU BRING UP IS NOT A TOPIC THAT'S NOT BEEN. ROOM ON OUR LAPS THIS WHOLE TIME IT'S LIKE HOW DO WE DO THIS HOW DO WE GET THE APPLICANTS. TO DO THE BEST POSSIBLE PROJECT IN APPROACH PROPOSALS SO AND THAT IN PART OF THE AND. YOU KNOW AND PART OF IT IS THAT WE ARE ALSO TOLD THIS IS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. SO. DINA AND THAT'S THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE CHALLENGE FOR US RIGHT BUT I GUESS MY REAL ULTIMATE IS. YOU'RE THE CONTROLLER OF THE KEY RIGHT. IF THESE FOLKS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE KEY MATT. THEY WERE NEVER DESTINED TO HAVE SUCCESS. THEY WERE DESTINED TO HAVE FAILURE. KEY IS THAT PAUL COMPONENT OF SUCCESS. AND YOU HOLD THE KEY. KEY MUST BE FIXED. BEFORE THESE APPLICANTS CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH ANYTHING THAT'S GONNA. GIVE THEM A RATING. THAT WILL BE SEEN AS ACCEPTABLE. SO IT'S IT'S IT'S AT YOUR LEVEL. BUT YOU NOW MUST RISE TO THE OCCASION. AND DIRECT YOUR STAFF DIRECT OTHERS THAT NEED TO BE DIRECTED. TO ACCEPT THIS AND SAY FOLKS. EVERYBODY CAME AWAY WITH NOTHING. WE MESSED UP. WE NEED TO FIX THIS AND FIX IT FAST. WE PLEASE DO THAT. VICE CHAIR CARE OF MAKE WANTED TO MENTION SOME. JUST AS A CLARIFICATION I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. WHAT THE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIOS THAT? WERE RELEASED AND. FEBRUARY. THOSE WERE INITIAL OF. OF REGION OF P. BR'S. AND. SO THAT GAVE THE THE APPLICANT'S AN INDICATION OF WHERE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN ISSUES AND. ALSO THERE WERE OF. A STAFF OUR STAFF AND THE REVIEWING AGENCIES SAT DOWN WITH THE APPLICANTS IN FEBRUARY TWO GOAL FOR THOSE AND. AND AGAIN THOSE ARE INITIAL OF. OF OF PBR HAS. AND. AS THE CHAIRMAN INDICATED WE IN WE GOT NINE THOUSAND FILES. IN RESPONSE AND SO IT'S OF. OF. SO SO I'M I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT WE HAVE TAKE YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO. OF HABIT A DIALOGUE WITH WITH THE APPLICANTS THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX OF. PROGRAM. AND AT LEAST IN MY OWNS A. STATE EXPERIENCE OF. THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE GRANT PROGRAM AND AND. THAT'S NOT TO TAKE AWAY FROM. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING MISTER BIGELOW BUT? BUT IT IS IT IT'S. IT'S KIND OF AN ODD DUCK IN IN THE. STATE GOVERNMENT YES BUT AT AT THE SAME TIME. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A RECOGNIZE THAT WERE LEADING. CHARITIES GO BY. WE CAN'T SQUANDERED THAT ANYMORE WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS SAID. AT UP AT PINNACLE POINT OF POTENTIALLY FAILING AS. AND IF WE DON'T FIT START TAKING ACTION NOW. AND AS WE HEARD FROM MISTER HOLLAND FROM YOU AND OTHERS. IT'LL TAKE MANY YEARS TO GET MANY OF THESE PROJECTS COMPLETED. AND WE CONTINUE TO MARCH DOWN A PATHWAY OF. IF HAVING. NO SUCCESS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TALK. TO LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S HERE. AND THIS OPPORTUNITY IS THAT YOU AS YOU ARE JUST ARTICULATED. LEVERAGE WHAT PROJECTS WHATEVER WAS. THAT ALL DIDN'T MEET MUSTER. NOW YOU GOT NINE THOUSAND CORRECTIONS. NINE THOUSAND CORRECTIONS. THAT CLEARLY ARTICULATES THAT THERE WAS. SOMETHING AMISS IN THE KEY. VESTED TWICE. ARE YOU WILLING AT THE COMMISSION S. COMMISSIONERS. TAKE THIS CHARGE FIX THIS. SITUATION WELL WE'LL CERTAINLY TAKE IT UP SERIOUSLY WERE HAVING A MEETING TOMORROW. I APPRECIATE THAT LEVEL OF COMMITMENT. TO TAKE THAT OUT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL. FIND A WAY TO REMEDY THIS SO THAT THEIR CAN BE THIS OPEN DIALOGUE. BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT ARE AFFECTED WHO ARE THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ALL SERVE. AND WANT TO GET ENOUGH ACTIVE OR EFFECTIVE PROJECTS MOVED FORWARD SO I'LL TAKE THAT. AS A POSITIVE. AND AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN WHATEVER YOU CAN DO. AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE TO HELP. SURE THAT THIS HAPPENS. I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND DELIVERING THAT THANK YOU. THAT WE HAVE UP MISS LEVINE FOLLOWED BY MRS RUBIO AND THEN THE DOCTOR. WILL YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT I'M JUST KIDDING. WE. I I WANT TO THANK MISTER CAN TEAR OWN THIS BAKER. FOR THE TESTIMONY IN AND FOR YOUR SERVICE WITH THAT YOUR OTHER COMMISSIONERS. THIS IS NOT YOUR DAY JOB. AND DIE AND FOR FOR MANY OF YOU THIS ISN'T EVEN YOUR YOUR YOU KNOW FIRST VOLUNTEER ASSIGNMENT FOR A COMMUNITY. THAT THAT YOU SERVE. TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU ALSO FOR FOR MISS TALK AND. MISTER HALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THE THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF. LAMENTING IN DEMANDING. YOU KNOW PLEASE THAT I'M HEARING. ARE REALLY TO ME. GEARED TOWARDS THE APPLICANTS ON BEHALF OF APPLICANTS. AND APPLICANTS AS I SEE OF RIGHT NOW. THEY MAY NOT SEE IT THIS WAY. AND SO ANYONE EDUCATE ME BUT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE. A SEAT AT THE TABLE IN NEGOTIATING WITH YOU. AND THEY HAVE THE APPLICATIONS INTO YOU. AND I JUST WANNA SAY WHEN WE PASSED EIGHTY FOURTEEN SEVENTY ONE. THE THERE WAS INTENSE BY THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE REGULATIONS. WERE WERE CIRCUMSPECT THAT THAT THERE WAS IT A PROCEEDINGS TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WORKED WELL FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA THAT THERE WASN'T A RUSH. TO GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR WHILE WE WERE IN. I DROUGHT AND PEOPLE REALLY WANTED TO GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR WE SAID WE'RE PUTTING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PUBLIC MONEY. ARE INTO SOMETHING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT SPENT WELL. AND ALSO IT IS FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT. I THINK THAT. WHAT WAS LOST IN A LOT OF THAT? WAS. I THAT MANY PEOPLE JUST WANTED THE MONEY TO HELP THEM FIND THEIR. PROJECTS. AND. IN THE PROCEEDINGS WERE WHERE THAT PUBLIC BENEFIT RIGHT REGULATIONS WORD GENERATED. THAT. YOU PERHAPS. THE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU SAW DIDN'T FULLY. ARE. DIE JASTER COMPREHEND THE FACT THAT THERE REALLY WAS AN EXPECTATION OF PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT THIS MONEY ISN'T RELLY JUST FOR THEM TO FINANCE THEIR THEIR PROJECTS PERIOD. AND IT TAKES A LOT OF EDUCATION FOR THAT. BUT ONE OF THE POINTS THAT MR HALL HAD MADE AND IN HIS WAS MORE IN IN I THINK THE. THE THE APPEALS PROCESS ABOUT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BUT. DO YOU. DO YOU THINK THAT. PERHAPS IF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WERE ENGAGED IN AND YOU KNOW THE CONSERVATION NGOS BY THINK THAT THERE WERE OTHER. STAKEHOLDERS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ENGAGE EARLIER ON IN THE DEVELOPMENT. OF THE REGULATIONS THAT. MAYBE THAT. PUBLIC EDUCATION OF BOTH APPLICANTS BUT ALSO PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS. OF WHAT THE COMMISSION WAS LOOKING FOR OUT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEARLY COMMUNICATED. IN I I THINK WE TRIED TO ACHIEVE THAT I THINK. YOU KNOW AS AS WAS STATED EARLIER COMMISSIONERS AS COMMISSIONERS WE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE STATE IN HOLDING PUBLIC MEETINGS AND GETTING INPUT. FROM EVERYONE AND WE ACTUALLY HAD TO CONSISTENT AND. REGULARLY PRESENT. UP PARTICIPATION BY NGOS. PENA A ETFS INTO SIERRA CLUB. AQUA HAD REPRESENTATIVES PRESIDENT PRESENT AT ALL OF THE MEETINGS. AND THERE WAS A THERE WAS A LOT OF. IT WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION THERE ARE ALSO A LOT CLEARLY THEY WERE. THERE WERE A LOT OF SORT OF CAMPS ABOUT WHAT THIS MONEY WAS TO BE USED FOR AND THAT. ARM THAT REMAINED AS MUCH AS WE TRIED TO SAY HERE'S HERE'S THE SIDEBOARDS OF WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH. YOU KNOW. WE CONTINUE TO HEAR STORIES ABOUT HOW THIS MONEY FROM INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS HOW THIS MONEY IS SUPPOSE TO BE SPENT. ALBUM AND WE REALLY TRIED TO COMMUNICATE THAT LOOK WE'RE WE'RE HANDED THIS TASK. OF CREATING A COMPETITIVE PROCESS THAT HAS TO DO WITH PUBLIC BENEFITS AND I THINK THAT IT. YOU KNOW AS MISTER HALL MENTIONED IN THAT THIS WAS THIS IS A UNIQUE BEAST AND THAT SHIFT IN THINKING. ARM IS REALLY TOUGH AND I THINK EVEN FOR FOLKS WHO WORK WITH WATER UTILITIES A FAIR AMOUNT IT WAS IT WAS A TOUGH THING TO THE TIP. MANAGE AND SO. I I KNOW THAT WHEN WE WERE IN THE LAST DAYS OF WORKING ON THE REGULATIONS IN EVERYBODY CAME UP MY MEMORY IS THAT EVERYBODY YOU CAME UP TO COMMENT.ꞯ PROCESS OF THE TWO YEAR PROCESS OF CREATING REGULATIONS WE HAD POSITIVE COMMENTS FROM THE WATER INDUSTRY WE HAD POSITIVE COMMENTS FROM. THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND FROM TRIBES AND FROM. OF THE WATER UTILITIES AND ONE THING THAT I REMEMBER HEARING IS EVERYBODY SAID YOU KNOW THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD IT'S NOT EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED. BUT THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD AND SO I THINK THAT. I MEAN I THINK THAT STAFF. AND THE COMMISSION WE TRIED OUR OUR BEST TO TO CREATE THAT LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING. BUT IT. WE HAD CONTINUED HAVE WORK TO DO MARK YEAH I IT'S YOU KNOW THERE'S NO. ASTROLOGY ONE IN THE COMING ABOUT THAT. IT JUST COUPLE COMMENTS SAID THERE ISN'T A LOT OF. IMPORTANT POINTS AND THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING US RIGHT I DON'T WANT TO. DIMINISH THE URGENCY OF IT BUT I THINK. WE ARE CERTAINLY DEALING WITH. A SITUATION AS I DESCRIBED WHERE WE'RE BREAKING NEW GROUND WE ARE FIGURING THINGS OUT AS WE GO AND. IF IF WE WERE. LOOKING TO BUILD WATER STORAGE PROJECTS THAT MET SOME SPECIFIC POWER GENERATION NEED. THERE'S AB RECIPE AND SOME ENGINEERING BOOK SOMEWHERE THAT SOMEONE WOULD LOOK TO AND CLICK THROUGH AND SAY HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AND SO. I'D AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF MY IN JAIL COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED ALONG THE WAY PROVIDING INPUT. WE FELT THAT THE STAFF HAS BEEN QUITE RESPONSIVE TO OUR INPUT AND THE AND THE COMMISSION'S MEMBERS SPONSOR BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN AND THERE THAT. THAT OUT IN THE REGULATIONS FOR INSTANCE THAT I DIDN'T SEE YOU BUT. I'M SURE THEIR NEIGHBOR EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AND PROBABLY HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THOSE. I DO THINK. YEAH IF I HAD HAD THE CHANCE TO DO IT I WOULD PROBABLY DO IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BUT I PROBABLY ALSO CAN'T. BE CERTAIN THAT THE WAY I THINK IT WOULD'VE WORKED ANY BETTER AND I'M CERTAIN THAT WE WOULD'VE HAD KINKS TO WORK OUT AND PROCESS SO. ARE ALL THAT TO SAY. I THINK THERE IS. GOOD REASONS THAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH S.. OVERALL I. ENCOURAGE THE COMMISSION TO. THAT IT DO THEIR BEST TO BE RESPONSIVE IN THE IN THE TIME FRAME GIVEN AND AND. AS I INDICATED EARLIER IT DOESN'T SEEM REASONABLE TO ME THAT. TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY GOES AGAINST. THE PREFERENCES OF SOME OF THE OTHER. AYE INTEREST INVOLVED. OF BUT I DO THINK IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THERE HAVE BEEN BLIPS AND. VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE US ALL TO TO. TRY TO PROVIDE INPUT TO MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD IN A. IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY I APPRECIATE THAT MR HALL AND AND I'M VERY COMFORTABLE. WITH FAR YOU KNOW IRONING OUT ANY WRINKLES IN THIS PROCESS WE WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT. ON I I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY REASON TO. TO. YOU GIVE A PASSING GRADE ON HOMEWORK THAT'S INCOMPLETE OR DIDN'T TAT FOLLOW THEIR THEIR THAT REGULATIONS. THAT WERE PUT OUT AND I WOULD. WARNED THE COMMISSION NOT TO DO THAT IF IT YOU KNOW FELT THAT THERE WAS ANY PRESSURE TO DO IT I'M ONLY HERE. FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE WANT TO SAFEGUARD THIS MONEY. AND THEN WE WANT TO GET THE BEST WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT OUR LIMITED RESOURCES CAN GET US AND MAXIMIZE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND THAT'S YOUR CHARGE. SO I'M GLAD THAT WHAT I'M HEARING IS YOU TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT. I'VE READ COMMITTING TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IS A GOOD THING MAKING SURE THAT NO THERE ARE NO SECRETS HERE YOU'RE NOT HIDING THE BALL TO THE APPLICANTS. THEY THAT MAY HAVE THE REGULATIONS THAT IF THEY HAVE IF YOU KNOW THEY NEED. TO GO WIN FOR US SOME AFTER CLASS TUTORING PERHAPS THE WATER COMMISSION SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE MAYBE NOT EVEN NECESSARILY. TO ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM FOR THE APPLICANTS BESET THE APPLICANTS CAN GO OVER THERE APPLICATIONS DIRECTLY. WITH THE COMMISSION SO THEY CAN GET SOME CLEAR GUIDANCE AND IF THAT IN FACT MEANS. THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE TOLD YOU KNOW WHAT THIS APPLICATION JUST IS NOT APPROPRIATE IT DOES NOT MEET. OUR NEEDS THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY FOR THEM TO HEAR THAT AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN THEN MOVE ON AND ALSO THAT THE COMMISSION CAN FOCUS ITS WORK IN ITS LIMITED RESOURCES ON THE BETTER APPLICATIONS. THANK YOU PUT. SOME MEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU I'M I'M THE NEWEST MEMBER. HERE HOWEVER SINCE YOU GUYS OPEN UP THE. TEACHING ANALOGIES I AM A TEACHER AND. THE WHOLE OTHER CAN OF WORMS ARE JUST OPEN BY THE WAY. IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE LOOK LET ME BACK UP WHEN I GIVE HOMEWORK. THIS I GIVE CRITERIA AND I GIVE THE RUBRIC AS TO WHAT THE HOMEWORK. SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND WHEN IT'S TURNED IN THESE ARE THE EXPECTATIONS AS OUR RUBRIC. AVAILABLE TO THE APPLICANTS BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE IF YOU'RE DOING THIS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AS OPPOSED TO. THEIR SOME RUBRIC THAT I CAN GO LOOK UP AND THEN I CAN SAY OKAY DOES MY PROJECT IT HERE BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE. A LOT OF THIS IS BEING. LOOK THAT ON THE. APPLICATION BASIS AND THEY'RE BEING. GOV FAIRNESS PART IS LOST BECAUSE THERE IS NO CLEAR RUBRIC SO FIRST YOU HAVE A GROUP THAT IDEA LIKE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE PRIMARILY SPENT THE TIME ON IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGULATIONS WAS IDENTIFYING THOSE RUBRICS VERY CLEARLY INCLUDING MODELS THAT NEEDED TO BE USED HAVING TO DO. WITH CLAY THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES IT APPLICANTS HAD TO INCLUDE CLIMATE CHANGE MODELING. IN THEIR. AS A PART OF THEIR. APPLICATION FOR THESE SORTS OF FUNDS I MEAN THERE WERE THERE WAS NEW IT WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY NEW THINGS THAT FOLKS HAD TO DO WITH REGARDS TO THESE MONEY SO. THAT IS WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE SET UP TO DO IS TO. CLARIFY RUBRICS INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS OF WHAT KIND OF STUDIES YOU COULD USE TO SUPPORT. THE UNIT SUPPORT THE NUMBERS THAT YOU ARE PUTTING IN. IN YOUR APPLICATION AND SO THEN YOU CREATED WE WE CREATE THE APPLICATIONS RIGHT BUT THEY WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW RIGOROUS THE APPLICATIONS ARE WHEN WE CREATED THEM. I MEAN SO IF YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I GIVE HOMEWORK. YOU KNOW I CAN'T SAY ALONE THOUGH THE HOMEWORK SO HARD WHEN I CREATED THE HOME. FIRED THE HOMEWORK IS SO HARD TO CORRECT WHEN I'M THE ONE THAT DEVELOPED THE HOMEWORK AND SO IT'S CONTRIBUTED A IT SEEMS CONTRADICTORY TO ME. THAT WE CREATED THE THE THE APPLICATION PROCESS BUT NOW WE'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW RIGOROUS AND DIFFICULT THAT IS WHEN WE CREATED. AND SO IF YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT A CAN YOU IMAGINE THE APPLICANTS HOW THEY FEEL BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT TO REFER BACK TO THE KEY THAT MISTER BIGELOW WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU CREATED THE KEY AS WELL. AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS SO DIFFICULT WHEN YOU GUYS OR WE WERE THE ONES THAT CREATED THE WHOLE PROCESS. AND SO IS THERE A WAY TO. TO CLARIFY AND REALLY GIVE. AGAIN MY PICK MY WHAT I'M HEARING RIGHT NOW IS THAT. ONE APPLICATION IS VIEWED ONE WAY ANOTHER ONE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THAT'S NOT MY. UNDERSTANDING OR IT'S MORE ABOUT WHAT I HEARD WAS DIED YOU KNOW IF THERE'S AYE AS SUCH AND SUCH EXPERT THEIR VIEWING AND I THINK. MISTER HALL MADE THAT COMMENT DIED. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENGINEERS LOOKING AT THIS AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT WAYS WELL THERE'S A RUBRIC IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT DIFFERENTLY. YEAH I AGREE AND I THINK THAT PART OF WHAT THAT THE ONE HOUR MEETINGS RICHER YOU CAN LISTEN TO THEM ONLINE YOU CAN HEAR THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WHAT HAPPENS WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING IN THOSE MEETINGS. IS THAT YOU HEAR ENGINEERS FROM THE APPLICANT SIDE AND FROM THE STATE SIDE SAYING ó. WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND COMING TO AN UNDERSTANDING WHICH I I HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE A FAIR AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE SUBSEQUENT FILES THAT WERE SUBMITTED. AND THE UPDATED APPLICATIONS ARE GONNA BE. ALL LOT CLOSER TO THE MARK IN THIS FIRST ONE. AND. THEN THE FIRST BOMB DEADLINE AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WAS. I GUESS IN THE IN THE ANALOGY OF HOMEWORK THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY NEW COURSE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY NEW NEW CHALLENGES AND SO THAT'S WHY ALSO WE HAD THE APPLICATION PERIOD OPEN FOR FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS WITH STAFF EQUIPMENT BUT THEN THE COMITATO ALSO WAS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS. COMPONENT OF THAT IS THAT IF YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK TO YOU KNOW ONE APPLICANT FOR EXAMPLE THEY MIGHT BE PERCEIVED BY ANOTHER APPLICANT AS UNFAIR WELL IF YOU HAVE DIRECT GUIDELINES AND CRITERIA THAT FAIRNESS% QUESTION SHOULDN'T COME INTO PLAY. BECAUSE YOU HAVE DIRECT. YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY THE REASON I'M TALKING TELL THIS PERSON IS BECAUSE OF THIS. YOU KNOW EXPLAINS THE. THE SOLES SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT PART ABOUT WHY IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. IF THE INFORMATION IS CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT THEN THERE SHOULD BE NO QUESTION AS TO THE FURNACE BECAUSE IT'S ALL WRITTEN IN THE APPLICATION ORINDA AND THE STATUTE WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT AND. MY MY CALLED EXECUTIVE OFFICER UP AGAIN. YOU WOULDN'T MIND JOE. WHAT I? PART OF WHAT HAPPENS PRESS IS BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE BEEN HANDED IS THAT THIS HAS TO BE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. IT'S HOW DO WE KEEP HOW DO WE KEEP THAT COMPETITIVE. PART OF THE PROCESS IN PLACE AT THE SAME TIME THAT WERE ASSISTING APPLICANTS AND THAT'S BEEN THE JUNGLE I THINK THAT'S PART THE JUNGLE FOR US. AND. AND THEN THE THE OTHER PRESSURE OF COURSE IS MEETING THE TIME AND AGAIN. BELIEVE ME I I THINK WE ALL WOULD OF LOVED TO HAVE SEEN THESE PROJECTS COME THROUGH THE DOOR WITH ME WITH THEM REFUNDABLE PROPOSALS. ON BUT WE ALL ALSO RECOGNIZES THE FIRST TIME WE'VE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND SO. WELL AND AND JUST. I EIGHT AGAIN THIS IS MY LIFE YOU KNOW KIND OF MY MY. FIRST TIME GETTING MY FEET WET IF YOU WELL BUT BUT WHAT I ALSO HEAR FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THIS IS JUST STRICTLY FROM THE OUTSIDE IS THAT YOU MAKING THE CRITERIA SO DIFFICULT TO. ACHIEVE BAD AND AND THIS IS JUST AN ANALOGY BY FOR EXAMPLE I WHEN I TURN IN AN APPLICATION IF IT'S MISSING A COMMA YOU DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S MISSING A COMMA. AS OPPOSED TO HE LET ME HELP YOU THERE'S ACCOMMODATES MISSING HERE SO THAT WE CAN. I LOOK AT THAT PROJECT OBJECTIVELY IT AS AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT THE COMMA. IT SOLD SO AND THIS IS JUST AGAIN OUTSIDE. INFORMATION THAT I'M GETTING IS THAT IT'S. THEY'RE GIVING DING ON REALLY. COMMENTS FOR EXAMPLE RATHER THAN THE PROJECT AS AS YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC BENEFIT OR THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK THAT IF YOU. LIST IF YOU TO LISTEN TO A COUPLE OF THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE APPLICANTS. IT'S NOT ABOUT COMMAS IT'S ABOUT. THE WOODS YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN YOU APPLY THAT INFORMATION TO THIS FORMULA THAT WASN'T THE INFORMATION YOU NEEDED TO USE YOU NEED TO USE THIS INFORMATION OVER HERE. SO WAS NOT. IT'S A I WORK AT A UNIVERSITY AND I WORKED WITH GRANTS AND SO I DO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES YOU THE WRONG FONT IN YOUR APPLICATION GETS KICKED OUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH THESE APPLICATIONS IN FACT. I THINK EVERYBODY IS REALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING THESE PROJECTS GO FORWARD BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY. EVERYBODY WHO'S INVOLVED IN THIS FISH AND WILDLIFE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD NDW ARE ALL RECOGNIZE BENEFITS FOR THE PROGRAMS AND. PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY EXIST IN THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAM OR AND THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE HOW MANY APPLICATIONS HAVE YOU RECEIVED AND HOW MANY HAVE BEEN REJECTED OR HOW MANY ARE. ARE NOT UP TO OUR WE RECEIVED TWELVE ONE APPLICATION DIDN'T EVEN MEET THE BASIC CRITERIA. AND SAID THAT ONE DIDN'T CONTINUE BUT NOW WE HAVE ELEVEN WHICH ARE GOING FORWARD. AYE GOING FORWARD. AS IS OR GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE THE NINETY THOUSAND CORRECTIONS NINE THOUSAND NINE THOU DOESN'T FILED NINE NOW THEY KNOW HOW THEY. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE JUST SO THE ELEVEN HAVE NINE THOUSAND FOR YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH I HAVE STAND THAT HOW CAN YOU HAVE NINE THOUSAND CORRECTIONS ON TWELVE ARE AROUND ELEVEN APPLICATIONS IF THEY CUT IT JUST. IT DOESN'T. AND I WILL I THINK WE WE GET THE POINT WHAT AND I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THE PROBLEMS WERE ALL DIFFERENT IT WASN'T LIKE EVERY APPLICATION AT THE SAME. THAT THE SAME DISCONNECT IT WAS IT WAS. IT WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT ON ISSUES AND AND BELIEVE ME I REALLY DO FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY IS INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS WANTS IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE WANT MONEY TO GO OUT THE DOOR AND WE WANT TO GET OUT. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I MIGHT ADD WITH CONFIDENCE AND THAT'S I THINK THE THING THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARDS THE CONFIDENCE. THAT THE CONFIDENCE FOR THE APPLICATION RIGHT IN AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE WORKING HARD AGAIN I THINK WHERE MY. MY HEAD THAT KEEPS GOING BACK TO IS. I'M. IF WE CREATED THE PROCESS SHOULD BE THAT COMPLICATED TO BE ABLE TO TO CHECK THE HOMEWORK. BECAUSE IF WE CREATED THAN WE KNOW WHAT THE CRITERIA SHOULD BE WHEN YOU GO TO A CLASS YOU GET ON. RIGHT AWAY YOU GET THE INFORMATION FROM THE PROFESSOR AS WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THAT CLASS IN EIGHT SOMEHOW IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT THE CASE HERE. AND SO WE CAN GO ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND. BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS. IS IS. ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO FOR US TO KEEP UP YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO TO THE SAME THING IF IT WAS WE WOULDN'T HAVE NINE THOUSAND. ARE CORRECTIONS I GUESS AND I PLEASE YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT IT JUST MIGHT JUST I ALSO SAY THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE REGULATIONS WAS COLLABORATIVE. YOU KNOW REALLY WERE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN IN THE PUBLIC. IN THE PUBLIC ARENA. EVERYBODY PARTICIPATED AND IT HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN A VERY OPEN PROCESS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M ABOUT THE PROCESS IS OPEN BUTWE HERE WE ARE. I MEAN AND SO I REALLY DIDN'T AND SO BY TWO THAT I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THAT HE NEEDED ELSEWHERE QUESTIONS I WILL BE ASKING MORE QUESTIONS BUT THE ABSOLUTELY SIGN ME UP ON THAT THAT LETTER BECAUSE THIS IS. IT. AS A AS A VOTER. WHEN YOU VOTE FOR SOMETHING AND IT'S TAKING FOUR YEARS FOR A TO COME TO FRUITION AND IT'S A KIND OF I'M. KIND OF. LEAVES ME SHELLSHOCKED ABOUT VOTE FOR SOMETHING ELSE IF IT'S NOT IF WHAT I INTENDED. I. WHEN I VOTED WAS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. I'M NOT ENCOURAGED TO VOTE ON ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEN THEN THAT'S WHERE WE GET THE REPUTATION OF ALL THE BURKE BUREAUCRACY AND. YOU KNOW YOU YOU FILL IN THE BLANKS AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SUPPORT OTHER. BONDS IF THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. TAKE SOME MEMBER WE HAVE DOCTOR BUT I'M BLUFF FOLLOWED BY. SOME MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M GOING TO ASK TWO QUESTIONS TODAY I'M GONNA START WITH MISS TALK AND THEN MOVE ON TO CHAIRMAN CAN TARA. FIRST YOU KNOW BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I WAS AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR AND WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES IN AN AREA THAT. I'M QUITE PROUD OF OUR AGRICULTURAL ROOTS. AND ITS NOT LOST ON ME THAT MANY OF THE PLAYERS WHO YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT WE WERE NOT INCLUDING. THOSE WHO ACTUALLY WORKED IN THE FIELDS AND THOSE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A VOICE. AND I BELIEVE IT'S MY OBLIGATION TO COULD BECAUSE YOU WORK QUITE ADAMANT ABOUT. BRAG ABOUT YOUR PICTURE OF THE SIGNING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND I HAVE FOUND IN THIS BUILDING THAT PEOPLE ARE. QUICK TO TAKE PICTURES AND RIBBON CUTTINGS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATIONS OF THE LAWS THAT ARE DULY IMPORTANT. SO I WANT TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING FROM YOU EXPLICITLY IF I CAN. WHAT WAS THE INTENT OF SPEAKING ABOUT CONVEYANCE? IS THERE A CHANGE IN WHAT WAS VOTED ON IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. WITH. ANY NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAY COME. FORWARD FROM HERE ARE WE CONSIDERING CONVEYANCE IN OUR CURRENT APPLICATIONS AND WHAT ROLE DOES THAT PLAY INTO. WHO IS SELECTED? SECOND QUESTION IS GOING TO BE FOR YOU CHAIRMAN CAN TEAR. AND I. REALLY. ENJOYED MUCH OF WHAT YOU SAID AND. I'M YOU KNOW I'VE I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT QUOTE BEFORE IN GOD WE TRUST AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE WE NEED DATA. I'VE HEARD IT DESCRIBED THAT WATER IS A MATTER OF FAITH. I COME FROM THE VALLEY AND FOR US I'D ACTUALLY LIKE MARK TWAIN'S QUOTE THERE LIES DAMNED LIES AND STATISTICS. YOU HAVE SAID THAT THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN DEFINITIONS AND OUTCOMES YOU'VE SAID THAT. WERE APPLYING THE STANDARDS AS THEY ARE UNDERSTOOD. BUT AS WE ARE CARVING A NEW PATH FORWARD. HOW? CAN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THIS PROCESS AS IT'S CURRENTLY BEING. PUT FORWARD IF THIS WAS A NEW COURSE. AND WE'RE HAVING NEW CHALLENGES SHOULD WE CONTINUE THIS COURSE. EVERYONE FAILED THE FIRST TEST. IS THAT ON THE APPLICANTS OR ON THE PERSON GIVING THE TEST. SO HOW CAN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE MOVING FORWARD THAT WERE PERFORMING TO THE UP MOST OF OUR ABILITIES. SO TO THE FIRST QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. ON THE CAN ON CONVEYANCE AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONVEYANCE IN THE VALLEY NOT. NOW I'M NOT TALKING ACROSS THE DELTA SO OKAY. I'M CONCERNED THAT WE MAY SELECT SITES THAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO POTENTIALS FOR CONVEYANCE WITHOUT JUDGING WHAT WAS PUT IN FRONT OF THE VOTERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DECISIONS ARE REFLECTIVE OF ONE VOTERS INITIALLY VOTED ON IT AND NOT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONVEYANCE IN THE DELTA OKAY. ON WHICH IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION I THINK I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WAS. VERY CAREFUL BOTH ON BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BUT I. WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THEY WERE VERY CLEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING WASN'T. GOING FOR FOR EXAMPLE THE TUNNELS PROJECT AND AND THAT WAS AN EXPLICIT PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS AND I BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE. THAT WAS RESOLVED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. SO CAN WE SAY THAN THAT. ANY POTENTIALS FOR WATER FIX OUR NOT BEING CONSIDERED AND. APPLICATIONS ARE WE EXPLICITLY EXCLUDING. THAT AS A DECISION FACTOR. IS IT BASED ON WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF US IN TWENTY FOURTEEN OR IS THIS A MOVING TARGET. I I DEFER TO THE COMMISSION ON THAT IT WAS BASED ON WHAT WAS IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE LEGISLATION TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT WE CAN FOLLOW WE DON'T HAVE NEW TARGETS OR IDEAS. THAT ARE BEING PRETTY. THEY SHOULD. MAYWEATHER CRAFTERS OF ALL THIS. GOOD OR BAD THAT THE PROJECTS WERE LIMITED TO ONLY THE. PROJECTS OF RECORD A DECISION. FOR THE CHAPTER A CONSIDERATION SO WHATEVER WAS IN THE RECORD. DECISION IS WHAT PROJECTS. WE'RE ABLE BE STUDIED AND UTILIZED AND RECOGNIZED. VOTED FOR YOUR ANSWER. SO IT IT MAY HAVE BEEN EXPANDED SINCE THEN BUT TECHNICALLY THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE. A SEPARATE DISCUSSION. THAT'S NOT BEING DISCUSSED HERE TODAY. AND. THE REASON WHY I BRING IT UP AS I KNOW THIS IS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND WHILE I MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH MY VICE CHAIR ON EXACTLY WHERE THE STORAGE PROJECTS ARE. I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SAID THAT TWO THIRDS OF OUR WATER RESTORED NORTH OF THE DELTA. AND IF WE LACK CONVEYANCE NOW. HOW ARE WE CONSIDERING FUTURE PROJECTS NORTH OF THE DELTA SHOULDN'T WE LOOK AT AS A STATE WHAT'S NECESSARY? FOR OUR CURRENT STATE OF CONVEYANCE AS WORD DECIDING MAJOR PROJECTS LIKE THIS SO THAT WAS REALLY MY INTENT OF THAT FIRST QUESTION. BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET A SENSE OF I CAN HOW DO WE HAVE CONFIDENCE. HOW DO WE LOOK AT THIS PATH FORWARD AS BEING ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLICATED? THAT IS WORTHY OF US WHEN WE HAVE AS MANY QUESTIONS AS WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHERE MID PROCESS RIGHT NOW SO WE HAVE NOT WE HAVE NOT REACHED THE POINT OF? OF DECISION MAKING HERE AND I THINK WE ARE ALL HOPING FOR WERE REALLY SIMILAR OUTCOMES I MEAN I THINK THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TO OUTCOMES IT. THAT HOME WE ARE ALL PLEASED WITH IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS BUT WHERE MID PROCESS RIGHT NOW IS ONE THING THEY DON'T SAY. THE OTHER THING THAT YOU MENTIONED IS ARM. IN THE MEETINGS THAT WE HELD AROUND THE STATE WE ABSOLUTELY INCLUDED THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES AND THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND WE TOOK MEETINGS TO FRESNO. AND TO. OTHER AREAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY UP TO SACRAMENTO TO CHICO. AND WE HAD A LOT OF REPRESENTATION IT AT THE THOSE CONVERSATIONS FROM THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. IN FACT THAT WAS I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF TESTIMONY FROM LONG TIME FAMILIES. FROM CALIFORNIA WHO'VE BEEN. BUT WE'RE AGRICULTURE IS THEIR HERITAGE. ON THE COMMISSION ITSELF JOE DEL BOSQUE WOULD OF OUR MEMBERS IS A IS MAJOR RANCHER FROM THAT LOS BANOS AREA. WE ALSO HAVE A COMMISSION MEMBER. MUDDY AT ADAM WHO IS FROM BY CELLULAR WORKS WITH SELF HELP ENTERPRISES AND IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH COMMUNITY ISSUES. THEY'RE SO THAT HAS BEEN THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN ALWAYS ON THE TABLE IN THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE SUCCESS. OF THESE PROGRAMS THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM AND HOW TO BE. AUTUMN. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE EVALUATE THEM I. THE THE PROCESS THAT WE CAME UP WITH WAS A COLLABORATIVE ONE SO WE TOO WERE SURPRISED. YOU KNOW IT WAS NOT A GAME OF US TRYING TO YOU KNOW OUT WITH ANYBODY AND AND DISADVANTAGED AN APPLICATION OR ADVENT GIVEN OUT ADVANTAGE WAS ANY CERTAIN TYPE OF APPLICATION. I'M WILL BELIEVE ME WE ALL WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD SAN OKAY LET'S GET ON WITH THIS SO. ARM I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A PART OF OUR PROCESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AND HEARING FROM YOU. BUT I I CAN SAY THAT THEY THE STAFF OF THE COMMISSION. AND THE PROFESSIONALS FROM WITHIN THESE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WE ARE ALL LOOKING FORWARD. TO. ACTIONS THAT TAKE US ON THE SMART PATHWAY FORWARD FOR WATER IN CALIFORNIA. LET ME JUST THEN ADD MY TWO CENTS IF I CAN. NO WE HEARD ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR THE SYNERGISTIC BENEFITS OF THE PROJECTS AND. YOU KNOW IT. IT'S. COM. IT'S SAD IN A WAY THAT I WAS NOT HERE TO HELP AT A VOICE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING IMPACTED BY THE DECISIONS THAT ARE HERE RIGHT NOW. WORKING IN AN ER I SAW PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WERE SHORTENED BECAUSE OF THIS DROUGHT. AND I AM DOWN. A BIT DISTURBED TO SAY THAT. WE'RE NOT CONSIDERING THEIR VOICES AND REALLY LISTENING TO WEAR PROJECTS NEED TO HAVE STORAGE IN TERMS OF BENEFITING. THOSE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DISADVANTAGES. NOT EVERYONE HAS A VOICE OR CAN COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS. BUT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE HEARD AS WELL AND I HOPE WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS THAT YOU TRULY DO. CONSIDER ALL OF CALIFORNIANS INSTEAD OF. AND. SIMPLY. BUT BEFORE US RIGHT NOW SOME. WITH THAT I. LOOK FORWARD TO THE END OF THIS COURSE. BUT WE AS THE LEGISLATURE. PROBABLY SERVE IN THE CAPACITY OF DETERMINING IF WE RENEW YOUR COURSE FOREST FUTURE ONES. AND WOOD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO. FOLLOWED THE PROCESS AND ALLOW US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE. END GOAL MEETS WHAT IS A BEST USE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU DOCTOR WE HAVE. SO MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING UP KNOWN. AND LEARN A LOT FROM YOUR PRESENTATION AND AND THINK TO COMMISSIONER FOR YOUR. OF HARD WORK AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO TO MAKE IT RIGHT. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE. TELL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND AND WHEN WHEN I HEAR THAT YOU WERE SMALL NINE THOUSAND INCLUDING USE A PILE. OF HOW TO FILL UP THAT APPLICATION I FILLED I WAS. BUT THE. THAT DEFINITELY SOMETHING DAD. DID THE DEPARTMENT CAN. THEN I MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENT ON. SHE SHOULDN'T BE DOT COM COMPUTING I KNOW IT IS A VERY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT. ISSUE BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW AGES REFILE BALL WHEN I LEARNED THERE WITH THAT DAMN MANY OF QUESTIONS. IT AND I'M A. QUESTION IT IT JUST SCHEDULE HERE. IT'S A PRETTY FIRM OR WOULD JUST A MATTER. CONTAGION. NO I SCHEDULE. THE BASIC IT WAS BASICALLY OUTLINED IN THE STATUTE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING IS THAT THE VARIOUS STEPS THAT WE HAD TO TAKE AND WE WERE TRYING TO BE. BUT YOU KNOW AS EFFICIENT WITH THAT TIME IS POSSIBLE OR YOU KNOW AN EMPTY BY EFFICIENCY I MEAN DO A GOOD JOB. WITH THE CHAT WITH THE CHARGE IN IN FACT IT WAS LAID OUT THAT. WE COULDN'T BE. THAT WE WERE GONNA HAVE A TWO YEAR PROCESS TO DEVELOP THE RAKES IT SAW IT WAS ALL LAID OUT AND STUFF YOU KNOW I'M JUST UNDER. NO ME REPHRASE THE QUESTION OF THE PIG PIECE OF PAPER I GOT HERE. IN THE END OF THE HOUSE ON DATE ON THAT. ARE WE GOING TO HOLD FIRM ON THOSE STATE. THAT'S OUR INTENTION. INCREMENTED IS OUR INTENTION AND WE AND. SO WHERE DO. WERE NOT SURE DAD CHO WOO WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REALLY HOLD FIRM ON THIS DATE. AND I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING. OKAY YEAH I'M TAKING A LOOK AT WHICH. YEAH THAT'S BEEN THE PUBLIC SCHEDULE OF THE COMMISSION. FOR THE DECISION MAKING STEPS AS WE'VE BEEN GOING FORWARD ON THIS OKAY HAVE WE EVER MOVE TO THE DATE BEFORE. DURING THE DAILY NEWS CHECKED IT TWO YEARS PROCESS. WELL WE DID. WE DID OPEN IT UP FOR THE A AT FOR THE APPEALS FROM APPLICANTS. AND SO THAT WAS A CHANGE THAT WE MADE AND AGAIN AS A COMMISSION AND AS A BODY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE. YOU KNOW THE PHASES THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND SPEAKING ABOUT IT IN THE PUBLIC FORUM IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS AND SOLUTIONS ARE TO. THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE ENCOUNTER MAHOGANY AGAINST MY OF. A MESSAGES SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN NO ONE WOULD HAVE A SCHEDULE KNOWING HOW CHALLENGE. THE DIFFICULT HOW DIFFICULT IT THE TASK MAY BE. I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN STICK WITH THE GOOD GOOD GOOD. A APRENDER SCHEDULE. AND A AND YOU KNOW THAT'S THEM REFLECTION OVER WHEN YOU. MAKE THE SCHEDULE YOU HAVE ALSO TAKEN INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF HOW DIFFICULT A TASK IS HOW CHALLENGED THE TASK IS. CLOSE SO AND GOOD BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY MY ASK WHY WE DO THE TRYING YOU KNOW WE WOULD PUT OUR. A BASKET. ALL OF THE ASSN WENT AND AND IMPALA SCHEDULE LESS HOME WANT TO AND I THINK THAT'S IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. WILL HELP US TO GAIN SOME PUBLIC TRUSTEES SO KEEP MOVING THE SCHEDULE. AT AND TALK I. QUICK QUESTION DO YOU KNOW FROM MICE THE STAFF. WHO OF FOR A A MISS TALK IN THE TO OF PRECISE TO MEET HIM BEFORE APRIL TWENTIETH? WHAT AUDIT MEETINGS HAVE YOU REQUESTED? TO ACQUIT USE HAS BEEN TALKING WITH THE COMMISSION STAFF ABOUT OF BASICALLY THREE MEETINGS. AND ON ONE OF THEM WOULD BE A MEETING IN EARLY APRIL. TO. TALK ABOUT THE. APPEALS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED CLARIFICATIONS ON THOSE APPEALS WITH ALL THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED. AND THEN WERE SUGGESTING ANOTHER MEETING IN EARLY MAY. IN THIS WULD BE ON THE OTHER COMPONENT SCORE ISSUES THERE'S INTO THE PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BUT THERE ARE OTHER COMPONENTS SCORES. AND THIS WOULD BE. YOU KNOW THE APPLICANTS HAVE PROVIDED THEIR APPLICATIONS THE REVIEWERS ARE REVIEWING THAT RELATIVE TO THE OTHER COMPONENTS BUT BEING ABLE TO FOR A REVIEWER AT STATE WATER BOARD FOR EXAMPLE TO ASK A QUESTION. RELATIVE TO THOSE OTHER COMPONENT SCORES WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. SO THAT WOULD BE. A SECOND MEETING WERE SUGGESTING. ON. YOU KNOW PRIOR TO MAY TWENTY FIFTH FOR THAT. AND THEN OF THE THIRD MEETING WERE SUGGESTING IS DURING THE WEEK OF ON JUNE FOURTH TO EIGHTH HAVE A MEETING TO. ON THE JOB DEBRIEF ON THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT SCORES. AND ON TO INFORM. A PROCESS BECAUSE THE COMMISSION BE HAVING A MEETING JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH TWO TWENTY NINTH SO THERE'S THREE PARTS WE HAVE SHARED THIS WITH THE COMMISSION STAFF. WE. DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE IS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS IN THE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE FAIR BUT WE THINK THESE MEETINGS CAN BE HELD IN A TRANSPARENT WAY AS THE COMMISSION DID IN FEBRUARY WHICH WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AND THAT CAN HELP THESE KINDS OF. INTERACTIONS CAN REALLY HELP THE PROCESS. WHERE DOES MEETING OF REQUIRE SKINNER GRANTED BY THE COMMISSIONER ARE WAS TO? HE TALKS. SO WE WE SUBMITTED THEM TO THE STAFF AND I BELIEVE THERE'S GOING TO BE A DISCUSSION AT THE MEETING TOMORROW. ABOUT THESE AND THE PUBLIC MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL MITCHELL LIKE A REASONABLE REQUEST AND HOPING THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO. BY HELP THOSE MEETING. INCOME PLACE AND WE THINK A GOOD PROCESS ON THIS HELPS EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE EARLY. DEFINITE INDUCES SOUNDED BY POVERTY ON A DIFFERENT. AS. A HEARING YOU KNOW I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW. HOW WE CALL IT A OUR THE PROGRESS OF HOW WE SPENT THE OF THE REST OF THE SEVEN POINT FIVE? BILLION DOLLARS IN OH ON THIS CHART YOU HAVE THE BOND THAT A FULL POINT A BILLION DOLLARS IS ON THE WEBSITE OR SOME INFORMATION THAT I CAN. I CAN THAT I RECEIVED IT THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE. FOCUSED ON IS THE COMMISSION IS THE TWO POINT SEVEN THAT VOTED TO HAVE EVEN TOUCH YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE BILL AS ARE OTHER AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE MANAGING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE FUNDS OKAY. SO. WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND ARE IGNORED DISCOURAGE ABAJO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK THANK YOU SOME MEMBER THE. NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE PANELISTS AND MAY BE. IT KIND OF CLOSING COMMENTS PERHAPS THE MINUTE CLOSING COMMENTS EACH ONE OF YOU. AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THINGS A BEAVER TODAY IN. HOPEFULLY SOME OF THE TAKE AWAYS DATA YOU KNOW WE WILL FOCUS ON. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE WILL BE DRAFTING A LETTER. THAT THAT MAY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST OF THE COMMISSION. LET ALL THREE OF THOSE MEETINGS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED AND OPEN THAT THE COMMISSION WILL. SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. ADDING TO THAT LEVEL OF. A TRANSPARENCY INCLUSIVENESS THAT THAT ALREADY HAS TAKEN PLACE BUT. IN THE INTERESTS OF MAKING SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS. I WHAT WAS DRIVING. TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. JUST ONCE MORE. RIGHT SO WHAT MR GIVE THAT ALL START WITH YOU AND WE'LL GO AROUND TO ALL OF THE PANELISTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH ALL OF YOU AND I THINK I CAN SAY THAT THE COMMISSION IS ABSOLUTELY HAS BEEN AND IS ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED. ON THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM. AS I'VE SAID EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE IS TRANSPARENT. I IT'S BEEN A TRANSPARENT PROCESS WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN EX PARTE POLICY WHERE COMMISSIONERS ARE NOT TALKING WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE OF PUBLIC MEETINGS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT. ANY CONFUSION THAT THERE MAY BE SOME HAND SHAKE DEAL OR ANYTHING SO WERE ALL. VERY FOCUSED ON THAT AND. AND I DO THINK THAT. THIS LEGISLATION REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MANY STEPS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE GOING FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. AROUND WATER THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT AND AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS BE TRUE TO THE LANGUAGE IN THE LEGISLATION OUR GUIDANCE AND DO REALLY. TO DO THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE AND I ACTUALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE STAFF. OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION WHO HAS JUST WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD ON PULLING TOGETHER. THE SUPPORT IN THE INFORMATION TO MAKE. OUR EFFORTS SUCCESSFUL AND I REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO. ACCESS COME JULY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TO. BUT I THOUGHT IT I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD I JUST WANNA. THANK THANK THINK Q. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ON THE PROP ONE STORAGE MONEY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION HUGE. INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY FUTURE AND FOR HOME IMPROVING ECOSYSTEMS WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT THE COMMISSION STONE ALL THE PROCESS TO DATE. STAFF WORKING ON THE WORK OF THE OTHER AGENCIES THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK. ON FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND THEN FINALLY WE AS YOU'VE HEARD WERE RECOMMENDING THREE FUTURE INTERACTIONS WE THINK THAT CAN BE TRANSPARENT AND IT CAN HELP THIS PROCESS BE SUCCESSFUL. THINKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR YOUR ATTENTION OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE OF SOME REALLY INTERESTING AND HELPFUL ARE QUESTIONS I THINK TODAY. I JUST OUR I THINK TO ITERATE REITERATE SOME OF THE POINTS I MADE EARLIER AND RESPONDING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME REAL CONTENT CHALLENGES THAT. THE WATER COMMISSION STAFF OF HAD TO DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE HOW DO YOU COMPARE WHICH IS BETTER TO HAVE SOME FLOW. IN THE SPRING FOR THIS SPECIES VERSES WATER IN THE GROUND FOR THIS RIPARIAN HABITAT. REAL CHALLENGING THINGS THAT. TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO'S COMMENTS UP. IT IS CHALLENGING TO DEFINE A REAL CLEAR RUBRIC ON THAT AND SO IDEA I THINK IT'S NECESSARILY ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS. AND. THAT SAID I VERY MUCH. ENCOURAGE THE. THE COMMISSION TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A. OF A TRANSPARENT PROCESS I THINK. HOPE THEY WILL CONSIDER YOUR POINTS TODAY AS AS THEY MOVE FOR AND MAKE THESE DECISIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WOULD BLOW OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND. THOSE OF YOU WHO. WILL BE SPEAKING IF YOU COULD USE A STATE YOUR NAME. YOUR AFFILIATION AND DUCK PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO. A MINUTE OR SO THANK YOU. AT GOOD AFTERNOON HOW JONES THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS PROCESS AND I THINK I'VE BEEN ATTENDING MEETINGS AT THE WATER COMMISSION FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW WORKING THROUGH THE REGULATIONS AND NOW WORKING UP THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR APPLICANTS. I'M AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT BOB CALIFORNIA'S WATER IS NOTORIOUSLY VOLATILE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE TO PLAN. FOR THE FUTURE LOOKING AT HYDROLOGY AS IT CHANGES AND AS WE'VE SEEN IT CHANGE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE OUR HOW DO WE DO WITH THE MELTING SNOWPACK. HAD WE DON'T PROJECTS THAT MAYBE CAN MEET PERFORMANCE STANDARDS IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THEM THIS YEAR BUT. MAYBE NOT IN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. SO IT IS VERY NEW PROGRAM THAT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN UNDERTAKING AND THEY ARE. BEING REALLY INNOVATIVE AYE IN ITS APPROACH AND I THINK THAT DOES EXPLAIN A LOT OF SOME OF THE HIT UPSET ABOUT HAPPENING. ITS ENTIRELY NEW. AND IT'S IT'S FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HADN'T SEEN IT BEFORE OB I THINK. AYE AYE I AGREE THAT. AFTER LISTENING INTO THOSE OF THOSE MEETINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING IN FEBRUARY THAT THE PROCESS WILL NOT IMPROVE OVER THE INITIAL PUBLIC BENEFIT. ROB RATIOS ARE AND SO WE ARE YOU KNOW CONCERNED ABOUT. ADDING EXTRA MEETINGS IF YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE WE'RE GONNA BE CONCERNED ABOUT AT HOWARD THERE'S GOING TO HELP IN THE PROCESS MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE DOING. APPROPRIATE THINGS. AND NOT JUST BY HAVING STATE AGENCIES PROVIDING. UNNECESSARY. ATTENTION TO PROJECTS OR GIVING THEM EXTRA HELP THAT THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE FAIR I'M WE THINK THE STATE AGENCIES DO HAVE A JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE BENEFITS MATERIALIZE THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE SPENT EFFECTIVELY. AND AND AND FOR BENEFITS THAT BUT A CREW AND ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND ARE JUST ON PAPER. THAT BEING SAID I DID MONEY. JUST MENTION THAT. I AND SECOND THE ASK OF MR HALL THAT. WHEN THE REVIEWERS COME OUT WITH THEIR SCORES ON APRIL TWENTIETH THERE'S ABOUT TEN DAYS BETWEEN THAT AND THE FIRST MEETING FROM THE COMMISSION. ARE THAT INCLUDES A WEEKEND SO FROM NUMBERS THE PUBLIC IT'S GOING TO BE KIND OF HARD FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GET OUR COMMENTS AND ON TIME ON HOW THOSE. SCORES HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME AND I THINK IF IF THAT IS POSSIBLE TO MOVE THEM THAT THE COMMISSION COME OF THE MEETING BACK IN MAY. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE PUBLIC TO HAVE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMENT MORE EFFECTIVELY DURING THAT MEETING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO. SPEAK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M GARY BOB OF THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT THE BANDS TO TO. NO I THINK THAT ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT THERE'S A HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. UP CONSTRUCTING WATER PROJECTS THAT WERE JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF OF VERY GREAT BENEFITS THAT. THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO CREW WHICH DID NOT OCCUR. YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE BIG WATER PROJECTS WERE IN LARGE PART JUSTIFIED A BY THE INTENT TO REDUCE A GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT. HOW THAT WORKED OUT? A PREVIOUS BONTA MONEY HAS BEEN DIRECTED IN LIKE IN PROP THIRTEEN PROP FIFTY TOWARD PUBLIC PROJECTS OVERSEAS BUT TOWARD PROJECTS WERE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE PUBLIC ABOUT MONEY FOR FOR BENEFITS BUT WE NEVER REALLY DEFINE WHAT THOSE BENEFITS WHERE. THERE'S SOME QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE REALLY GOT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WERE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE A AND THAT MEANS IT'S A IT'S A BIGGER LEFT AND THE COMMISSION TO ITS CREDIT IS ACTUALLY DEFINED. WHAT PUBLIC BENEFIT MEANS IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A TOUGH JOB AND WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IS CHALLENGING BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE? AND PREVENT OF THE. WASTE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON PROJECTS THAT A LOVE FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT MIGHT BE JUST ICING ON THE CAKE FOR SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD PAY FOR THEMSELVES SO. YOU KNOW IT'S EXCITING GUT SINGS GO THROUGH THIS IT'S CHALLENGING BUT WE HAVE TO DO THIS AND WE HAVE TO STICK A YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO STICK WITH THE PROCESS THAT WE'VE DONE. DESIGNED. THE OTHER POINT I'D MAKE A AND THIS IS A TWO TO REINFORCE WHAT POINTS OF MISTER JONES JUST MADE. IS THAT. I I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE AN OBJECTION TO IMPROVING THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN APPLICANTS IN THE COMMISSION BUT REMEMBER THIS IS A COMPETITIVE PUBLIC PROCESS. LET ME REPEAT THAT A COMPETITIVE PUBLIC PROCESS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THE APPLICATIONS TO REVIEW THE RATINGS TO REVIEW THE APPEALS TO UNDERSTAND THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE APPLICANTS AND COMMISSION IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS AS THE OTHER PARTS. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE TIME ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE. I AND SO AS WE LOOK AT ON. SCHEDULE MORE MEETINGS YOU KNOW FIDDLING WITH PROCESS DON'T FORGET THAT PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. PART BECAUSE IF YOU TINKER WITH THE PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE TO ALSO TINKER WITH THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ELEMENT OF IT THANK YOU THANK YOU. SINGER NO ONE ELSE OPIATES PLEASE COME FORWARD. AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OUT JUST WHAT TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS VERY QUICKLY FIRST AND FOREMOST. ONE DAY YOU'RE GONNA BE A PATH LEGISLATOR LIKE ME. AND WATCH BILLS THAT YOU MOVE THROUGH ITS ONE TWO THOUSAND NINE WE WROTE THIS. THE LANGUAGE IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME IF NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AND BACK IT IS THE SAME IN THIS PARTICULAR SECTION. WHEN THEY'RE STEINBERG IN THE LEGISLATURE CAME BACK AND REWROTE IT. AND THE ISSUE WAS A HAIRCUT. AND A HAIRCUT OCCURRED FROM ELEVEN BILLION DOWN TO SEEN POINT BLANK. I'VE IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THIS SECTION I WAS THE LEAST IMPACTED. SO EDUARDO EVERYTHING WAS CUT A AT THE END THE DAY IT CAME DOWN TO. HAVING THE REQUISITE REPUBLICAN VOTES. TO BALANCE THE PACKAGE THAT WOULD GET THE SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN THAT WAS DONE. BUT I THINK WHAT IS CONCERNING TO ME AND I JUST WANT THE NEWER MEMBERS PARTICULARLY AT THINK MISS RUBIO HIT IT RIGHT ON THE HEAD IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING YOU JUST CAN SEE IT. YOU CAN SMELL IT IT'S THE REASON YOU'RE ELECTED OFFICIALS YOU HAVE INSTINCTS. AND YOUR INSTINCTS ARE SUPPOSE TO BE USE FOR THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR OVERSIGHT STE STANDS RIGHT HERE. SO I WILL SAY THAT. LEGISLATORS PASS BILLS OF THERE ARE WONDERFUL BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH IF THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT TO SEE IF THOSE BILLS YEARS LATER. ARE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT SO I WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS FOR ASKING THE REAL TOUGH QUESTIONS. THE KEY TO THIS IS TO STAY ON IT. I TELL YOU TO HAVE OVERSIGHT CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS TILL THAT MONEY IS ALLOCATED. AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK OF THIS BOND IT'S FUNNY THAT SOME OF THE MONEY NOW IS NOT ONLY GONE BUT IT'S OVERSUBSCRIBED SO HE LOOKED RECYCLED WATER LOOK AT THE OTHER PIECES OF THIS. YOU SEE THAT MONEY HAS GONE OUT THE DOOR VERY QUICKLY. I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE DID THIS WEEK GAVE THIS AUTHORITY TO THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION AND NO SLIGHT TO RECRUIT MEMBERS ARE WONDERFUL BUT IT WAS A VERY SLEEPY LITTLE COMMISSION. AND WAS SLEEPY BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT WE GAVE IT TO STATE WATER RESOURCES. THAT STAFF WAS GOING TO DO EXACTLY WHAT OCCURRED HERE. AND WE KNEW THE SENATE TO THE W. OUR STAFF IS GOING TO DO EXACTLY WHAT IT DID HERE. AND THE GOAL OF THAT WATER COMMISSION WAS TO GET NINE STRONG MEMBERS THAT WOULD GET STAFF TO GET THIS MONEY OUT THE DOOR. PERIOD. WHAT OUT IN SOME SENSE GOING SO DEEP? THAT WE HAVE FORGOTTEN. THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE. AT THIS PARTICULAR BOND WAS STORAGE. THE ONLY THINGS YOU DO YOUR OVERSIGHT AND THE STAFF CONTINUES TO MOVE THROUGH THEIR PROCESS THAT I APPRECIATE IT LEAVE AFTER THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD I KNOW REGULATION IT WILL MAKE. BUT AT THIS POINT. S. RUBIO SAID WITH FOUR YEARS DOWN THE LINE AND A BIG STORM COMING AND TODAY. WITH VERY LITTLE PLACES TO STORE IT. WITH ANTIOCH REFERS ALL OVER THE STATE BELOW GROUND. SOME SENSE TO ME THIS IS A VERY TIMELY HEARING. AS IS VERY BIG STORM OCCURS AND I WOULD JUST SAY PUT THE LEGISLATORS. TEN YEAR OVERSIGHT IT TRULY IS. THAT STRONGEST POWERS YOU HAVE. PERIOD BECAUSE IF YOU'LL PASS BILLS AND LEAVE AND YOU MIGHT BE SITTING HERE LIKE I AM. SHAKING YOUR HEAD WONDERING AT SOME POINT IN TIME. WHEN THAT BILL IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE. SUCH WANT THANK YOU CONTINUE MISTER CHAIRMAN YOUR YOUR GOOD WORK AND AND FRANK AND OTHERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO MEMBER RUBIO I JUST HOPE YOU STAY ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT OVER. THANK YOU SENATOR AND AGAIN THANK ALL THE PANELISTS ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THAT. TENDED TODAY'S HEARING AYE WE WILL ADJOURN AT THIS MEETING THANK YOU
