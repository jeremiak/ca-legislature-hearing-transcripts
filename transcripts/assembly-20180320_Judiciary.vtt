00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:09.940 region:rollup2
COMMENTS TODAY ON THE PRAGMATIC

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:11.475 region:rollup2
REASONS WHY THIS IS SO.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.977 region:rollup2
EVEN BEFORE THE NEED FOR AN

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:14.478 region:rollup2
APPEAL ARISES ACCESS TO A

00:50:12.977 --> 00:50:16.013 region:rollup2
VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT IS

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:17.248 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE

00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:18.816 region:rollup2
LITIGANTS AT THE TRIAL LEVEL.

00:50:17.248 --> 00:50:21.185 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY

00:50:18.816 --> 00:50:22.720 region:rollup2
APPEARING ON THEIR OWN BEHALF?

00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:24.488 region:rollup2
FIRST VERBATIM RECORDS ARE

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.090 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO CRAFT ACCURATE POST

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:27.591 region:rollup2
HEARING RESTRAINING ORDERS OR

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.293 region:rollup2
CHILD CUSTODY IN BUSINESS

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:29.793 region:rollup2
VISITATION ORDERS THAT LAW

00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:31.896 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAN

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:33.230 region:rollup2
ENFORCE.

00:50:31.896 --> 00:50:34.632 region:rollup2
SECOND VERBATIM RECORDS ARE

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:36.300 region:rollup2
NEEDED BECAUSE CUSTODY AND

00:50:34.632 --> 00:50:38.002 region:rollup2
VISITATION CASES ARE FREQUENTLY

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.603 region:rollup2
LITIGATED. AND REVISITED OVER

00:50:38.002 --> 00:50:41.071 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS.

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:42.806 region:rollup2
COURT NEEDS A CLEAR RECORD OF

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:44.375 region:rollup2
PAST PROCEEDINGS TO DETERMINE

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:46.243 region:rollup2
WHETHER CHANGE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:47.845 region:rollup2
REQUIRE ALTERING CUSTODY OR

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:50.180 region:rollup2
VISITATION SCHEDULES.

00:50:47.845 --> 00:50:51.815 region:rollup2
MORE OVER FAMILY JUDGES OFTEN

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.151 region:rollup2
ONLY SERVED ONE OR TWO YEARS SO

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:55.753 region:rollup2
LATER JUDGES ASSIGNED TO A CASE

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:57.888 region:rollup2
NEED A CLEAR RECORD OF WHAT HAS

00:50:55.753 --> 00:51:00.024 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY HAPPENED IN THE CASE

00:50:57.888 --> 00:51:01.659 region:rollup2
TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE CASE.

00:51:00.024 --> 00:51:03.160 region:rollup2
A VERBATIM RECORD IS ESPECIALLY

00:51:01.659 --> 00:51:04.995 region:rollup2
CRITICAL ON APPEAL.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.697 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT LAW THE APPEAL IN

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:08.065 region:rollup2
MANY CASES WILL BE DISMISSED OR

00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:09.466 region:rollup2
DENIED WITHOUT A REPORTER'S

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:10.734 region:rollup2
TRANSCRIPT.

00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:12.102 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:14.138 region:rollup2
GRANTED REVIEW IN THE CASE

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:15.873 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE JAMESON

00:51:14.138 --> 00:51:17.641 region:rollup2
VERSUS DOSTA WHERE THE APPELLATE

00:51:15.873 --> 00:51:19.376 region:rollup2

00:51:19.376 --> 00:51:22.980 region:rollup2
THE REPRESENT OUR THE LITIGANT

REPRESENTING HIMSELF FROM

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:27.318 region:rollup2
ATTAINING A REVERSAL OF THE

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:29.153 region:rollup2
GRANT OF A MOTION FOR NON SUIT.

00:51:27.318 --> 00:51:30.654 region:rollup2
DUE TO THE LARGE VOLUME

00:51:29.153 --> 00:51:32.323 region:rollup2
UNLIMITED JUDICIARY SOURCES

00:51:30.654 --> 00:51:35.159 region:rollup2
WRITTEN OPINIONS ARE THE EXCESS

00:51:32.323 --> 00:51:36.660 region:rollup2
XIN AND FAMILY VIOLENCE CASES.

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:38.128 region:rollup2
AND EVEN WHEN THEY EXIST THEY

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.797 region:rollup2
OFTEN DO NOT SET FORTH THE

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:41.632 region:rollup2
FINDINGS THAT SERVICE THE BASIS

00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:43.100 region:rollup2
FOR AN APPEAL.

00:51:41.632 --> 00:51:45.069 region:rollup2
IN MOST OF FAMILY VIOLENCE THE

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.971 region:rollup2
PILOT PROJECTS CASES EVIDENTIARY

00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:48.872 region:rollup2
OR TESTIMONIAL ISSUES NOT

00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:50.708 region:rollup2
CONTAINED IN A WRITTEN ORDER.

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:52.242 region:rollup2
ARE THE ISSUE ON APPEAL.

00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:53.911 region:rollup2
SINCE THESE APPEALS ARRIVE IN

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:55.846 region:rollup2
CASES INVOLVING FACT INTENSIVE

00:51:53.911 --> 00:51:57.548 region:rollup2
REQUESTS FOR RESTRAINING ORDERS

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:59.416 region:rollup2
AND CUSTODY TERMINATIONS.

00:51:57.548 --> 00:52:00.818 region:rollup2
THESE FACTOR TERMINATIONS AND

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:02.753 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING OR

00:52:00.818 --> 00:52:04.955 region:rollup2
CONTRADICTING THEM WILL NEARLY

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:06.690 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BE AT ISSUE ON APPEAL.

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:08.659 region:rollup2
MORE OVER AGREED OR SETTLED

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.860 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS ARE NOT A REALISTIC

00:52:08.659 --> 00:52:11.195 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE FOR THE GREAT

PILOT PROJECTS CLIENTS.

00:52:13.097 --> 00:52:16.300 region:rollup2
AN AGREED STATEMENT REQUIRES THE

VICTIM TO COLLABORATE WITH THEIR

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:21.038 region:rollup2
