BEGINNING OF HOW IT WILL CHANGE THE ECONOMIES OF CALIFORNIA THE UNITED STATES AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN FACT NUMEROUS STUDIES AND EARLY APPLICATIONS OF FIVE G. AT ITS HIGHEST BAND WITH HAVE INDICATED THAT IT IS NOT MERELY USEFUL FOR STREAMING MOVIES. SHOWS OR PLAYING GAMES EIGHT PROMISES ALSO TO FUNDAMENTALLY REVOLUTIONIZED THE POTENTIALS OF EVERY INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE POTNTIAL OF HIGH BAND FIVE G. IS UNLOCKED AT A HOSPITAL ITS ABILITY TO TREAT PATIENTS IS GREATLY ELEVATED EIGHT ASSURING IS ABLE TO HAPPEN INSTANTANEOUSLY BETWEEN AMBULANCE VEHICLES AND E. R. ROOMS TIONS CAN BE MONITOR FROM THEIR HOMES TELEHEALTH APPOINTMENTS BECOME PRACTICAL FOR MORE PATIENT NEEDS AND FIELDS OF PRACTICE THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF HOW FIVE G. CAN IMPROVE HEALTH CARE YOU MAY ALSO CHANGE OTHER CRITICAL FEELS LIKE MANUFACTURING RETAIL TRANSPORTATION CONSTRUCTION UTILITIES EDUCATION AND OTHERS. SO HOW WOULD THESE INDUSTRIES AND OUR ECONOMY BE AFFECTED THOUGHT BY FIVE G. FINALLY IMPLEMENTING AND BUILDING OUT FIVE G. NETWORKS ALSO INVOLVES AND RELIES ON WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. INCLUDING THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN ITS ROLLOUT TO THAT END WE AS LEGISLATORS WANT TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF FIVE G. ITS CAPABILITIES AND ALSO WORK WITH THESE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS WHEN IT COMES TO DEPLOYING AND IMPLEMENTING FIVE G. I'M CONFIDENT THAT OUR PANELISTS WILL PROVIDE ALL OF THOSE. WITH THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND FIVE G. AND ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I RAISED EARLIER. WITHTHAT INFORMATION MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TOWARD DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS FOR FIVE G. RELATED ISSUES THAT THE LEGISLATURE SEEKS TO ADDRESS AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO A ROBUST AND INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION SO WITH THAT- LET ME INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL. THE FIRST PANEL WILL HELP DISCUSS THE SUB TOPIC FEATURES OF FIVE G. AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND DATA WE HAVE DOCTOR TIGER AW MAN UP GOAL PAUL ACTING DEPUTY DIVISION DIRECTOR AT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION. AND DR KIRTI GUPTA VICE PRESIDENT OF ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND CHIEF ECONOMIST AT QUALCOMM INC. SO WELCOME AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. SOMETHING AND SHALL BE THE APPRECIATE GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO- NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND COME AND BRIEF- THIS AUGUST BODY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF FIVE G. I. DID TAKE THE LEAD ON THE PRODUCT OF FOLLOW ME ON THE ON THE FEATURES OF FIVE G. AND HIS IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND THE DATA I OF YOU ALL AGREE THAT WIRELESS ACROSS THE JUST THINK IT'S BECOME AT THE SAME COM OF SOCIETY AND IT AND- THE LAST DECADE HAS SHOWN THAT. ENTIRELY NEW SERVICES THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS OF COME ABOUT. BECAUSE OF THE SLACKNESS COMMUNICATION NETWORKS BUT SO MUCH STARTED OFF AS- A SIMPLE CALIFORNIA SERVICE. GREW UP INTO. THREE G. WHICH BROUGHT US TEXT MESSAGING BLACKBODY THE NINETIES. AND LATE NINETIES AND THEN. THE LAST OF THE LAST TEN YEARS YOU HAVE REALLY MOVED ON- AND SEEN A TRANSFORMATION BY THE ADVENT OF. SMART PHONES WHICH ARE USED THAT. ARE PRESENT HIGH SPEED COMMUNICATION NETWORKS A DEEP CUTS AFFECT US FOR G. UNLEASHING A RANGE OF SERVICES JOBS. AND MULTIBILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES THAT ARE ON HURDLE THAT DIDN'T EXIST JUST ADVOCATE RIGHT SO THIS IS THE FAULT OF CONSUMMATION. THAT WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY AS DELIVERED AND IT'S NOT JUST WITHIN THE US GLOBAL GLOBAL CONSUMMATION OF INDUSTRIES. AND THE WHOLE PEOPLE PERCEIVE AND COMMUNICATE OVERALL. SO BE MORE DISTINCTLY NEARLY. NOW THE PAST YEAR DEL ENDEMICI SHOWN THOSE- CRITICAL ACCESS TO INTERNET IT'S- AN ESPECIALLY WIRELESS BOXES BECAUSE- THAT IS A- VERY VERY VERY MUCH 99% OF PEOPLE I'LL LEARN TO USE THE INTERNET. EVEN A SMALL TO WIFI RIGHT. THE NEW OWN MARKETS DOING ALL WHAT A WIRED CONNECTION NEEDS FOR ALL THE DAY PROBABLY. HAD NEVER SEEN I PRETTY MUCH ALL SECTORS OF SOCIETY RIGHT RELATED GOOD INTO MY AND DATA TO UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE THEIR LIFE DURING THE OF AND IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE DEMAND FOR FOSSIL COMMITTEE THIS NOT GONNA GO ALL RIGHT AND THIS IS ALL GOING WHAT I MENTIONED BELIEVES EARLIER IN THE REMARKS GOVERNOR TO GIVE HIS NAME ARE GOING TO BE ON MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOT GOT USED TO SEEING- IMPORTANT THIS IS WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ON THE OUT TO BE A LAW TO HELP EXTREME PLAYED A LITTLE EASEMENT AN IS GOING TO HAPPEN JEANETTE IS WE ARE GOING TO SEE TO OUR DATABASE ECONOMY THAT ARE GONNA BE DRIVEN BY ONE OF US IS GOING FABRIC THAT IS PROVIDED BY THESE NEGATIVE RG AND IT IS GOING TO BRING US SPEED IT IS GOING BRING A MUCH LOWER LATE MY ACCOUNT OF COMMUNICATION DELAYS AND IT IS GOING TO HELP US CONNECT MORE DEVICES THE BEST TEAM AND ME SAID DEVICES NOT JUST PEOPLE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SENSORS CAMERAS AUTONOMOUS CARS AND OTHERS LIKE A WHOLE HOST OF DEVICES THAT YOU NORMALLY WOULDN'T THINK OF USING A NETWORK BUT ALL OF THESE ARE GOING TO BE CONNECTED. AND THAT ENTIRE ECOSYSTEMS GOING TO CHANGE HOW WE ALL ARE GONNA GET ARTICLES VERY MANIFESTING IN CYBER SECURITY IS GOING TO BE- EVOLVE EVOLVING OVER TIME. RIGHT NOW AT THE KEY PART FOR MANY OF YOU ARTICLES AUDIENCE HERE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND DID I GUESS THAT IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO START TRANSFORMATION THE DIFFERENT SECTORS. BUT ONE OF THE KEY PLAYERS AND IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IS BECAUSE FIGHT IN THE COURTS ARE GOING TO COST. LOWER IN ORDER TO GET BY THE BRITISH WIRELESS NETWORKS MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE BALLOT SHIFT IN HOW THESE OF UNDERHOOKS I'M GOING FORWARD WHERE HARDER HOUSTON HIS BIG CUSTOMERS BOB THAT RUN BY ESTATE FUEL THAT HAD TO GET THESE COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THIS WOULD INCREASE COST OF DEPLOYING A INTERNET AND IF I MANY ALL WOULD NOT A GOOD THE NEXT FORWARD BECAUSE AFTER THE REVENUE JUSTIFY THE HIKE OF INVESTMENT THEY ROB AND. HI JAMES SWITCHING TO MODEL GRADE SCHOOL TO SUCK FOR SOME DEFINED NETWORK AND LOOKS WHAT IS OUR CAR KEEP DO CONSERVE THAT ARE UNDERLINE FAIR PLAY ACROSS BUT AND THEY'RE ALSO OPENING THE NECK THE NATIONAL RELAXES NETWORK IS ALSO US TO AB BUT DEFINED INTERFACE THAT ANYBODY CAN COME ON THE US OFFICE FOR THE PIECES THE NETWORK IS STILL THE DALLAS PART THE VERY CAN OF IT LAST WEEK NOT YOU KNOW INCOME PEOPLE TO GET UP AND VP RIGHT YOUR CYLINDRICAL GETS PROBABLY ONE TO BE CAN YEARS OR WANT TO DO FIGHT IT. BECAUSE THAT CYCLE AND SPEED WE CAN GET FOSTER UPDATES A SOFTWARE BASED IT BRINGS MORE VALUE OKAY IT'S CLERK NEXT BE PLUGGED CAN BE A PROBLEM ALL THEY'LL OPEN NETWORK AND IF YOU A TO SEE THAT I DON'T YOU CORRECT YOU CAN WRITE SOFTWARE THE PLUG THOSE HOLES AND THIS NECKLACE MODEL AND SECURE. SO GOD ALL ON THOSE BEING SOFT BASED ON THOSE LAWS TO GET BECAUSE FINDING IT AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE HOSPITALS EXCUSED ARE FOR AS FAR ARE HAVING A SMART BECAUSE BUSINESS OR AND IF YOU BILL NETWORK SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TO DOWNLOAD BY ADDING A SOFT BUSINESS PUBLIC WHICH REDUCES THE BAY TO ENTRY BY LOOKS HEALTHCARE WELCOME ON ALSO CALL LOWER BUT SO THAT IS THE BIG IMPACT ON SOCIETY THE DEADLINE TO SEE I'M FINDING THAT OUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW OF THIS WHEN I SAY SOCCER DEFINING IS ALL PART OF OUR MOST READ FORM WILL GET AND TO BOOKS ON JUST GOING TO BE BAKING THIS FROM THE DESIGN MAKING DESIGNS. NOT MANY THE PIZZA I THINK MOST OF YOUR HEALTH FOR FIVE G. NETWORK BENEFITS IN TERMS OF I AM SPEEDS LOWER LATER LARGER OF DEVICE THIS START OF A YOU KNOW ALL DID WAS DRUG THAT MAKES IT THEN I SPEED UP THERE SEEING BIG OR IN THE CAR FUNDS BUT THE OTHER I GO WITH A NICE GUY OVER TIME AND HE'S FOR THAT IS IT IS NOT ONE STAR YOU NEED TO DO TO LEAST ONE DAY OUTSIDE HE GETS G. IT IS AS IT'S AN EVOLUTION EVERY. WE ARE. ANYTHING MORE OF THIS FEATURE BENEFITS OF FIVE G. ALSO THAT IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE REALIZED OVER TIME AS THE STANDARDS THEMSELVES- ONE CAR MORE OFFICE FEATURES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLIC ABOUT US FIND BENEFITS OKAY BUT THE KEY IS BECAUSE SOFTWARE THESE YEAH EVEN SOMETHING TO BE DEPLOYED TODAY AND BE A FAN QUICKLY TO NEW OUR STAFF AND MUCH LOWER THE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT HERE INTERESTS TIDBIT THAT WOULD LIKE TO POINT THAT THIS IS THE SUSPECT IMPACT ON THESE BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. RIGHT THE NUMBER OF BOB ARE YOU CONNECTED THINGS THAT USED TO SELECT WORK THE WIRELESS INTERNET TO PAY ARE YOU INTERNET UP THAT I SENSE CAN I CAN ONLY A CAR LAUNCH SINCE. THEY HAD EXCEEDED THE OF HE BEINGS THE PLANET AND NUMBER IS GOING TO KEEP TROUBLING IN THE NEXT YEARS THANK THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER OF THERE WAS AS WELL IN SOME THE TRUCK FROM THESE DEVICES IS GOING TO. A MATTER OF THAT SMARTPHONE AND THE COME AND BEINGS I G. NETWORK AND OTHER LIFE NETWORKS AND ALL THAT ARE GOING BE THE CONNECTING BACK THAT HE DID INFORMATION FROM FLOWS NOT THE MACHINES TALKING ABOUT OF IT THEY ARE TRYING TO. PROVIDE INCOME SO THAT IT. HOW DO WE AND MACHINE AND I HAVE CAN DATA STREAM FROM DEVICES I AND ALSO PROVIDING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CONNECTED RIGHT SO I CAN LOOK AT PHARMACY CAN I CAN LOOK AT A SAY BETTER THERE'S A WATER PROBLEM I NEED TO THERE'S A RIGHT I GET ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THE IS GETTING CUT VALENTINE I AND I COULDN'T STOP LOOKING AT THIS COULD POLLUTION SAID WHAT KIND OF TO NEED TO IN REAL TIME SO ALL OF THE INTO IS TO HELP THE INTO KEEP COMPANIES TWO THREE A GAIN AGREE OF A OF ON REACT MANY QUICKLY ENOUGH DEPLOYED PROPERLY RIGHT THESE NETWORKS LOOK AND THOUGH DIGITAL QUITE AND THEY CAN BRING ABOUT MORE EQUITY AND INCLUSIVE IN THE SOURCE SAID OUTCOMES THAT GO HOPEFUL RIGHT I JUST DON'T BECAUSE THESE SENSORS ARE GOING TO BE GENERATED SO MUCH ON DATA CAN BE NEEDED FAST BECAUSE ALL FOR PROCESS IT DRY QUESTION OF WHO OWNS THESE HOLE IN OKAY THIS GET A BACK BE L. WHAT HAPPENS PURPOSE OF FUEL WORRY WHAT AND THESE ARE THE TO THE NEW TO BE AT AS SPOTS I DON'T CAN BE IF LONG AND PICK MAS'S BUT TO GET. IN ORDER ALSO PROJECT TO BE FUNDED GOOGLE'S INTENT- I. FIVE UTILIZAM GETTING MORE WIDER SPECTRUM TO DELIVER THE HIGH SPEEDS AND THAT IS CURRENTLY ACHIEVED BY TURNING SPENT WITH OTHER INCOME WELL WHO HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED THAT COULD SPECTRUM BANDS AND STUFF MOST MOST SHOWED WASN'T GOING UP OVER MY SUCH PROGRAMS THAT S. FUNDING OF LAST EIGHT YEARS AND MANY PRO THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT NAY FIVE G. ON USE OF PEOPLE HE'S COMMITTED EARLIER THIS WHICH WAS USED ASKED ABOUT SOLUTION FOR I DID IT BY SUCH AS AT STUFF CAL SANTA BARBARA AND YOU NEED AND WHAT YOU MEMBERS THROUGH S. OF THAT SO UP AGAIN WENT BACK TO THE DATA OUR MOST OF PRIVACY HOW COME ON DATA ON WHY THINK THE PRIVACY OF IN A BIG PROBLEM AND WHAT DONE NEXT WAS SUPPORTED BY AN S. ATTACHED LETTER DOLLAR OF THE NOR UP HALLMARKING ENCRYPTION IT'S ALL THOSE YOU TO WORK DATA VIDEO THAT YOU GET OUT FROM UNDER ASPECTS OF THE SO THE F. TO BE A CRITICAL OF I DO CLOSEST I I'M NOT GONNA SB- FORMA COMPANIES GOOGLE ALL COME AND YOU KNOW ARE HARD TO DO A THING TO YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT THE JAPANESE THE GET AND THE FOR THAT DOES NOT THE COMMITTEES GOING FACE AS TO BUY MATURE I KNOW OVER SO NOW I'M GOING TO MY OKAY FROM QUALCOMM AFTER UP. SOMEBODY CANNOT WOULD APPRECIATE THAT BUT LET ME PROCEED WITHOUT. SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HELP. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO MAKE THAT WORK BUT- IN THE MEANTIME YOU FEEL LIKE TO PROCEED FEEL FREE TO DO SO PLACE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S- IT'S WORKING NOW IS WORKING OUT OKAY. OKAY CAN YOU SEE THIS HONECKER YES YES WE CAN YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE GET GREAT IT ALWAYS HAS TO HAVE A VISUAL CUES I'M A VISUAL LEARNER AND I BELIEVE WE'LL START SO I THINK YEAH I GUESS SAID YOU KNOW IT'S THERE ARE WONDERFUL THAT YOU'RE HAVING THIS HEARING AT A VERY ABOUT MARTINEK TIED OR THE FIVE GW TO TAKE PLACE AND JUST ABOUT BLAKE AND EXPECT AND AS EXPLAINS WELCOME BEING IN THE BUSINESS OF DOING WIRED INSIDE INCEPTION WE B. R. THE WILD COMPANY AND IT'S AN IDEA AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN IT SINCE TWO THE G. BUT FEEDING YOU G. AS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER GENES ARE GENERATIONS OF FIRE NEXT IN THE PAST. BOB BECAUSE IT'S A PADDED AND SHIPPED WHILE FROM ONE G. TO MG TO THREE G. FOUR G. B. DESIGN THE SYSTEM FOR CONNECTING PEOPLE TO PEOPLE FIVE G. IS DESIGNED TO CONNECT. THINGS TO THINGS AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S NOT AN OVERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT FIVE G. SO WE CAN BE PART OF THE DRIVE EVERY WHO WON'T BE EVENT EVERY APPLIANCE WE USE EVERY. DEVICE YOU IT IS GO TO BE A COMMUNICATE BRAG FOR MODEL AND THEREFORE THEY COULD TELL RENEWALS REALLY ROADS WATER AND ENERGY OFF KIND OF OFTEN NATION BECAUSE THAT IS THE KIND OF STRUCTURE AND PEOPLE ASK US WHAT A FIVE G. LET ME QUICKLY DOWN TO THREE BASIC THINGS THAT IS FINE FOR THE INDUSTRY WHAT IS FIVE G. AND EVERYTHING FLOWS DROPPED NUMBER ONE IT'S ENHANCED MORE BY IT BROADBAND FASTER SPEEDS THAN YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE MAKING YOUR VIDEOS STREAM NOT DRESSED IN OUR VIDEO CHAT BY BEING ABLE TO STREAM GAMES AND LYFT IN STADIUMS HAVING ACTUAL CAPABILITIES FOR AUDIO- BARBARA BUSH HAVE VIRTUAL REALITY AND AUGMENTED REALITY ON YOUR GAS HAS BEEN NOW DELAYS WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS SEAMLESS EXPERIENCES- IT ALSO MEANS MASSIVE INTERNET OF THINGS EVERYTHING CONNECTED ABBIE THEY'RE SMALL SENSORS IN ELECTRICAL GRIDS IN HOSPICE AND MANUFACTURING STATIONS THAT CAN CONNECT TO- THAT CAN CREATE DENSE NETWORKS IN SMART CITIES AND PARKING LOTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY MISSION CRITICAL SERVICES VERY NO DELAY I'M GONNA ONE SECOND THAT'S LESS THAN THE FLASH OF A CAMERA TO TRANSMIT ONE PACKET FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER VERY YOU VERY HIGH RELIABILITY SIX NINE NINETY NINE POINT NINE NINE NINE NINE NINE NINE PERCENT. WHICH MAKES POSSIBLE USING THIS COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY PARTY ANY CRITICAL FEED SERVICES LIKE FACTORY AUTOMATION OUR REMOTE HEALTH CARE AND SYNERGY ARE CONNECTED CARS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT MODERATE. ANY LOSS AND ANY DELAY. IN THOSE APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH SAFETY M. DOT IS FIVE G. BAQI WELL FUNDAMENTAL REVOLUTION THAT A MASSIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT NOW AND WELCOME IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ACCENTURE WE TRIED TO ARTICULATE WHAT IS THAT ECONOMIC IMPACT BY STUDY PROBLEM SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES ARE GOING TO DRAWS FROM FROM MANUFACTURING TO HEALTHCARE TO RETAIL ETCETERA. AS FIVE G. IS TAKING BEING TAKEN UP AND ADOPTED BY THESE INDUSTRIES AT THE IMPACT IS IT'S TO SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS JUST IN SALES FORCE STARTED TRACKS AIMED AT US GDP ONLY IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN A POST PANDEMIC ECONOMY ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OFF NEW GDP AND UP TO SIXTEEN MILLION ADDITIONAL JOBS ARE AND- THAT CAN BE EITHER CREATED OR TRANSFORM AS BETTER JOBS WE ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD BE THAT IMPACT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AND WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION FOR BREAKDOWN OF CALIFORNIA IF DESIRED. BUT AS YOU CAN SEE BOTH IN TERMS OF THE GDP IMPACT AND JOBS NOT SURPRISINGLY THE IMPACT OF ON CALIFORNIA IS LIKELY TO BE THE HIGHEST AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR ECONOMY IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST IT'S OUR HIGH TECH ECONOMY IT HAS MANUFACTURING AGRICULTURE. RETAIL AND MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY FIVE G. CONCENTRATED IN CALIFORNIA AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF INDUSTRIES BY ARE THEY LEVEL UP IMPACT THAT WE ARE SEEING ARE YOU TALKING TRIED G. AS IT TRANSFORMS THESE INDUSTRIES OF COURSE PRIMARILY INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY YOUR DEVICES BY DEVICES ERP ARE CLASSES THAT SET UP. ANOTHER BIT OF THOSE AND I WOULD BE ALSO READ A FACT IS NOT A FAR BEHIND MARCH MANUFACTURING IS DESIRED BY FACTORY FLOORS BACK WANT GO WIRELESS IN THEIR AUTOMATED FLOW SO THAT THERE'S LESS DOWNTIME WHEN DID RECONFIGURING THEIR FLOORS REALLY NEEDING TO SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC GAINS AND BETTER HIGHER THAN JOBS- FOR THOSE WORKING IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR I AGREE TO GO PROFESSIONALS VIA ESTATE ORDER FINANCE HEALTH CARE CALL CONSTRUCT IN AGRICULTURE EVERYTHING EDUCATION IS SEEING AN IMPACT . AS RIGHT HE'S TRANSFORM. I'M GOING TO CHECK WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY BUT LET ME ALSO SHARE WITH YOU SOMETHING NEAR AND DEAR TO US IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE STANDARD BENEFITS OF FIVE G. GIVE LOOKED HARD AT THE DATA AND YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED AT LENGTH WITH ENGINEERS. WHO DESIGNED FIVE G. AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY IS TRYING TO USE LESS ENERGY FOR MORE OUTPUT FOR MORE OPTIMIZATION SO WE HAVE SEEN THAT BE I REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH ADMISSIONS AND POLLUTION AND INCREASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS MORE AND MORE DEVICES MORE TO FIVE G. EVERYTHING OUT OF ME. COMPARED TO FORTY AND PREVIOUS. NEXT LET'S NOW I IN TERMS YOU DEMAND WHAT IS IT THAT TESTING WHAT DO THEY WANT ME COME DOWN IT COMP SURVEY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES YOU AND THE REASON WE DIDN'T IS PEOPLE TO WONDER IS FOR G. IMPACT AND IS IN POST WILL BE TO CONTACT ME AND THEY FOUND THE ON TO BE OVER VENDING CONNECT IS THE ANY OF THE FRONT EXPECTATION IT IS SEEN AS CENSURE IN OPPOSED WILL BE KANEMI PEOPLE ABOUT FROM AND SOMETIMES NEED TO EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN I CONSUMERS AREN'T ONE THEY NEED AND OF THEY WANT SMALLER THEY THEY THEY HAVE WIREIMAGE ARE FLOW. HAVING THE CONNECTIVITY IN AND OUT THE AND EVERY TO PAY FOR IT AND YOU WOULD CONSUMERS RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A YOU TO DO THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDER AND I THINK G. HAS OF YOUR THEIR SO QUICKLY YOU KNOW R. AS CONNECTED DRILLINGS NOT ONE A CITY NINETY SO PERCENT OFF PEOPLE ONE GOING TO IN THE HOME AS OPPOSED 279% I THE THAT IS COMPARED TO THE PAST AND ENOUGH WILL SPEND ANY SO INTER DOES NOT A CRITICAL AT THIS WANT TO BE TO TRY HOME OUR CONSUMERS THERE NUYS THEIR THERE ISN'T YOU TO DO BOTH IN- ORDER TO ADD. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND I THINK FIVE YEARS OF YOUR IS THERE DONE MANY STUDIES TO WONDER BECAUSE UNIFIED D. HAS ABILITY TO PUT REMOTE AND DO NOT AND WE MADE LEAGUES ANTENNAS THE ARE NOW THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT TWO MINUTES I THANK REPEAT AND MAYBE RIGHT G. THE PROGRAM EIGHT. INTERNET REMOTE AREA I DON'T START PERCENT LOWER THAN FIXED SOLUTIONS WHY NEED TO BE DONE AND. NEXT GENERATION CONNECTIVITY BEING UP PATRIOTIC IF YOU'RE FOR MOST CONSUMERS. THEY'RE DOING THIS AS- AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR OUR COUNTRY TO HAVE. A LEAD AND INFLUENCE AND CONTROL OVER NEXT GENERATION OF CONNECTIVITY SO I'M I'M GOING TO SKIP A COUPLE OF SLIDES BECAUSE THAT'S READING TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND WHAT DID YOU WHAT THE MOST IMPORTANT GETS GETS ITS FOR FIVE G. THANK YOU TO. HE'S ON HEALTHCARE OR MANUFACTURING. AND WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES THAT THEY DID AYE FROM FIVE G. LIKE MANUFACTURING THINGS. AT INDUSTRY SECTORS SEES THAT THEY WANT TO SEE A ONCE THEY MOVE TO FIVE G. AND THURMOND. CONSORT OF- METRICS THAT HE CAME UP WITH AN FOR FIVE G. IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS INDUSTRIES. I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO END WITH. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN TO ME EVALUATION A REALITY. TO MAKE THIS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TRANSITION IN FIVE G. ACROSS ECONOMIES AND INDUSTRY SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA. NUMBER ONE. YOU MUST RECORD THAT BRANDY IN IN THESE TECH YEAH HARD INDEED INTENSIVE WITH FRIENDS BECAUSE ATTENDEES AND ENTER PROPERTY ME TO BOND TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE THIS ARE IN THE IN GOING BECAUSE YOU NEVER WE ARE A MARKET DRIVEN ECONOMY BEYOND GETTING CAUGHT IN THE FUNDING- FROM STATE SUBSIDIZED- GRANTS FOR THE MOST PART WE ARE FINDING OURSELVES BASED ON DECEIVING. ARE A MONETIZATION FROM LICENSING OUR INTELLECTUAL ASSETS ACROSS THE IN BE MUST ENSURE THAT THE WIRELESS THE STUDY THE SEMI CONDUCTOR INDUSTRY REMAINS RESILIENT THE SUPPLY CHAIN SHOCKS RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY HAS HEARD OF SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGES ACROSS INDUSTRIES MORE BY IS THE LARGEST USER OF SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS IF THERE IS A GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN DESTRUCTION THAT WOULD CRIPPLE RIGHT AND WE'RE GOING TO THE FIVE YEAR ADDITION NUMBER NETWORK NEED TO BE DEPLOYED AND BENT OUT NOT JUST TRADITIONAL NETWORKS OF TRONG YOU DON'T TAKING A ONE STOP SHOP FROM LONG BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS BUT ALSO EMBRACING A REVOLUTION THAT IS HAPPENING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIES WHAT OPEN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE NOT HIS NECKLACE THAT IS ABLE TO CREATE AN ECONOMY OF THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT COMPONENT PROVIDERS. THAT CAN SUPPLY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS FOR CREATING THE FIVE G. NETWORKS AND THEREFORE NEED NOT RELIGION AND I THINK THE FIVE G. INFRASTRUCTURE ECONOMY. I WILL STOP HERE AND HOPE THAT BIG THIS WAS INFORMATIVE AND THAT THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS FROM THE. ASSEMBLY FOR. OKAY THANK YOU VERY FOR YOUR LET US NOW GO TO COURT YOU A BUT I INITIALLY THAT PART OF MY INITIAL- REMARKS- WAS NOT PICKED UP BY THE AUDIO SO I'M GOING TO REPEAT SOME OF WHAT I SAID EARLIER- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE TO CALL IN- PLEASE- THEIR NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN. AGAIN THE PUBLIC COMMENT LINE IS. 877-692-8957 AND- SO WITH THAT LET'S OPEN UP THE QUEUE IN A- PORTION. I THINK THAT THE INFORMATION HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND YOU KNOW IT PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT THE PANEL IS. PROVIDED AND THAT NUMBER IS STAGGERING AND THE THESE EXAMPLE DAD THAT WAS GIVEN WAS THAT THE NUMBER OF A MOBILE DEVICES OR I'LL I'LL TWO DEVICES- IS GOING TO EXCEED. THE NUMBER OF HUMAN BEINGS ON THIS WORK ON THIS- EARTH AND- THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO TRIPLE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THAT THAT'S SO VERY STAGGERING NUMBER. SO THAT GOES TO SHOW HOW IMPORTANT- IT YOU KNOW IT IS TO FORCE TO BRICK BUILD A FRAMEWORK SO WITH THAT IN MIND I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS FOR THE PANELISTS. FIRST QUESTION BEING THAT DUE TO THE PREDICTED ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS FORESHADOW A LINEARIZED IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OR IS IT MORE OF A CURVED. AND EVEN RICE ANY OF THE ANY OF THE PALACE SO FEEL FREE TO CHINA. DID YOU WANT TO THE POST AB I BELIEVE THAT WITH EVERY G. THE RISE IS NOT YOU SEE THAT EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT BE FREE BUT HAVE SKEPTICISM AND THAT IS SOME TENTS AND BUILDING OUT ACTORS THAT IS SOME BARRIERS TO- THE INITIAL EXAM COSTS BUT MONTHS SPENT EVERY GENERATION WE HAVE SEEN THIS ONCE THAT. OUT IN THE SHOWS TRUMP IS OVERCOME YOU SEE AN EXPONENTIAL RISE AND BULLETS THE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT HAVEN'T HAD MENTIONED INCREASED- SO MUCH THAT IT EXCEEDED THE BARD POPULATION IN THE LAST FEW YEARS JUST SMARTPHONES AND YEAH I KNEW IT WAS AND THEREFORE GROWTH I BELIEVE THAT BEARD TO SEE THE SAME THING THAT FIVE G. BUT I DOES WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO TOUCH MANY MORE INDUSTRIES THAN ANY PREVIOUS GENERATION I WILL CALL WHAT. A CONTESTING AND I THINK THAT WHAT I SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE I DO NOT BEING A SINGLE STANDARD AT SOUTHERN UTAH ON THE SWITCH ON AND SEVENTY HAPPENS THE SAME PART OF PART OF THAT DESCRIPTION WHAT IS PART IS FIVE G. C. STANDARDS AND- HE'S TALKING SOMETHING FUTURE AND SOME FEATURES THAT ARE GOING TO. A NEW SENSE OF THAT BILL DOES FEATURES ARE ASSEMBLY ON THE AND I ARAMBULA TALK A LITTLE OF WATER IN THE NEXT SESSION BUT YOU KNOW THAT. LAYING ON OF HANDS RIGHT BEYOND WHAT NETFLIX BECAUSE OF THE POINT RIGHT ARE YOU VIDEOS WE DON'T KNOW DO YOU PLAY MORE OF THE BETTER SPEEDS YES YOU CAN CONNECT PEOPLE MIGHT BE CAN GET MORE WORK SO BUT IT DOES NEED TO IMMEDIATE BUT THE OTHER FEATURES OF FIVE G. THE DALLAS IN THE NEXT TO THREE STAND. DODD WILL NEED WHICH SO WHAT MAY SEE LIKE WHAT BE SETTING IT JUST YEAR'S THIRTY OR SOMETHING ELSE TO GO CONCERNED HUGE AND THEN WOULD BE COME ABOUT VENDORS APPLICATIONS ARE TESTED AND VIDEO ON THE ROLE ENOUGH THAT COULD SUDDENLY BECOME MUST MARKET RIGHT AND IT ALWAYS SO I CAN GO TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT ACCESS AND DON'T FORGET NAY DO WE SEE GAINES GOING THE PARTS OF SOCIETY EQUITY RIGHT TO DIE IS IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE I THINK THE BILL BIG FIVE G. IS TO THE COST OF BROAD IS GOING TO BE A PART OF THE MORE TO GO OVER SOME OF BROADBAND THE BAKER BE A EQUITY ARE INTENSE WANTS CHRISTMAS ALL SIX OF THE POPULATION HAVE TO SERVICE AND BUILD ON THIS GOING TO BE. FIVE. THANK YOU VERY THE SECOND I TO DEAL SO SOMETHING THE PARA HAS STILL I TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT AND QUESTION BEING THAT WITH G. NOT K. OF VASTLY MORE MORE DATA THAN BEFORE HOW DO FIVE G. C. ENSURE THEY'RE SICK I THINK THAT MENTIONED THE PRIME ISSUE IS AN HAS BEEN CHALLENGING IT'S CHALLENGING ONE SO I'M WONDERING WHETHER YOU COULD DOUBT YOU KNOW TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT EVEN MORE. ABOUT SECURITY AS WELL AS PRIVACY THANK YOU. I'LL TAKE A PASS THIS MONTH- IF YOU CAN MAKE. SURE SO. I THINK ASPECTS TO SECURITY YEAH RIGHT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. SECURING THE NETWORK MOST OF SECURING THE DATE. THANKS FOR THE NETWORK ITSELF IS THE PART THAT. MAKES. YOU IN PLACE ASIANS THE SERVER IN THE BACK OF RIGHT AND THAT BACK AND FOR IS FORM SECURE AND I THINK PART OF THE ART MANY SECURITY OUT THAT HAVE BEEN IN PREVIOUS GENERATION OF NETWORK AND WHAT FIVE G. HAS DONE IS TO AGREE A MUCH ROBUST DESIGN. MULTIPLE OPTIONS TO ACHIEVE REALLY DEBATE TITLED A SINGULAR SOME OF THOSE THINGS JOBS COME A COST OF BUT FAR ENOUGH INTO IN THE US I USED NETWORK I THINK FIVE G. IS ONE THOSE CAN THAT IS GOING BE MUCH MORE SECURE IS DEEPLY OPTICAL TO THOSE PLACE OPTION ANY GENDER MEDICAL GET SEEN WITH RIGHT NOW ALL THE BAR ABOUT WHAT THE DAY SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE TO THANKS BYE IS WHY I WOULD THINK ABOUT US POLICY REQUEST OUR PRIVACY OF DATA A HOW DO THESE STORE ARE SECURE THAT DATE IT MAY NOT HAVE ANYTHING THE NEXT ITSELF RIGHT AND MAYBE MORE OF WELL I DON'T THINK AND- PEOPLE LIKE IN THE GET ON OTHER SIDE SO THAT'S THE TYPE A DIFFERENT BUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EARLIER WE LOOKED AT MAP OF ALL THIS IN IN THE IN THE COUNTRY ARE WHEN IT COMES TO DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES WELL I GUESS OF THE FIRST IS HOW HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES COME STACK UP AGAINST LET'S SEE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES TO A DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. YOU KNOW WE HAVE NOTICE OF FROM THE FROM THE GROUT THAT CALIFORNIA IS BASICALLY IN THE BASICALLY THE FRONT RUNNER- COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND THEN I ALSO PRESUME THAT- YOU KNOW THIS DEPLOYMENT IS A MAJOR PART OF THE- WITHOUT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. AND IS VERY COMPETITIVE IN CARING CALIFORNIA'S BUT BUT THE QUESTION BEING THAT YOU KNOW HOW HOW WELL THIS UNITED STATES A STACK UP AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES WHEN IT COMES TO DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. GREAT QUESTION. THAT DROP THANK YOU ALL SAW OF THE UNITED STATES ACROSS STATE WAS AN ESTIMATED POTENTIAL ECONOMIC GAIN. ACROSS STATES. IF FIVE G. IS DEPLOYED IN A TIMELY MANNER FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY. FIVE IT MAY NOT HAPPEN. IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE IT HAPPEN APPLAUSE DIFFERENT NATIONS- US IS IN THE LEAD RIGHT NOW FOR DEPLOYMENT BUT CHINA AND EUROPE AREN'T FAR BEHIND IN CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES LIKE MILLIMETER RADIUS B. HAVE A LEAD AND AN EXACT AGE AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY I IT'S LIKELY BASED ON OUR PROJECTED ESTIMATE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A LEAD IN THAT ECONOMIC ATTRACT ACROSS INDUSTRIES. JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE AND SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY AND INDUSTRIES. I'M GLAD THAT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MARKET BASED ECONOMY MEANS THAT ENTERPRISES AND COMPANIES IN THE SPACE I HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE TO STAY UP IS UP TO PAR EVEN TRIED TO BEAT THE COMPETITION. LOCALLY THANKS AGAIN GOT ON THE U. S. A. IN BULK AND PACKAGED. YES OTHER COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO THE OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE TRYING REALLY HARD TO- TO CATCH UP OUR TITLE OR BE THE LEAD BUT THE FIRST STEP IN ADVANTAGE OF ENTERING A MISSION. THAT I YEAH AND THE CHEMICALS THAT IS THE US BENEFITS HERE VERY GOOD THANK VERY MUCH OUR TO THANK THE TWO SO FOR YOUR PRESENTE AND LET'S NOW GO TO OUR SECOND PANEL. FOR THAT DATA. ARE WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HOW LONG JOINING US AGAIN DR NANDA GOPAL- THE TOPIC OR SUB TOPIC IS EMERGING TRENDS IN FIVE G. AND SPECIFIC USE CASES JOINING DR UNETHICAL PAUL. ARE ALSO- WE HOW BY THE OF THE RUDY RAY S. VICE PRESIDENT AND ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE WESTERN. WITH FOR THE WEST REGION AT VERIZON. AND THE THIRD PANEL AS WE HOW THIS CHRIS BOYER WHO IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL SECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY AT A. T. AND T. SO WELCOME AND IF YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PLEASE BEGIN LET'S START AGAIN WITH THE DOCTOR NOW LOCAL PAUL THANK YOU AGAIN AWESOME JOB AGAIN PRIVILEGED TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS OTHER IN THAT TOPIC THIS IS SOMEWHAT EMERGING TRENDS IN FIVE G. AND SPECIFIC USE USE CASES. I MENTIONED IN THE EARLIER PART OF THE GETTING BACK THE KEY FEATURES OF FIVE G. R. INCREASED DATA SPEEDS. REDUCE DELAYS INCREASED NUMBER OF DEVICES. THAT CAN CONNECT TO THE NETWORK AND THIS IS CALLED CONNECTION DENSITY ALL THE ALREADY HAD A LISTING THE INCREASED IT HAS BEATS- WOULD BE OUT IN THE US DOES NOT ON AUGUST MORE GOING HAPPENED IN FIVE G. UNDER TO. UP IN THE DATA AND THE CONNECTION DENSITY OF. ALL OF THE TWO. I BELIEVE- THE ACTION DENSITY ESSENTIAL THE SUPPORT LAW NUMBER OF INTERNET OF THINGS DEVICES THAT ARE GOING TO BE AND PROVIDING A WITH THIS OF THAT NEXT FROM THAT INCREASED HELLO SYNCING MONITORING THE WITH THIS DEVICE. ALL IN TERMS GIVING CHANGE RIGHT I THINK OF WHAT THE ULTRA LOW LEADER REALLY DEBT COLLECTION IS GOING TO BE A GAME CHANGER AND INCOMES MORE BY FAX DAY SURGERY ARE AUGMENTED CAN OF PUBLIC THIS SOME THAT SOCIETY HAS SEEM BEFORE I'M NOT ARE NOT TO THIS IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO. BE PHYSICALLY PRESS OR HOW TO FEEL OF BEING PRESS AND IT IS NOT LOCATION AND BEING ABLE TO AND THE DOLLAR THE I'M NOT LAW THAT YOU'VE VERY IN THAT SPACE WHEN YOU PUT ON A PERSONAL DATA HEALTH SO IT'S NOT A FUTURE AND CAN BE ENABLED BY THIS SO MICRO LONGER LATE ARBITERS ARE DUMB AND GIVE FEATURE THAT IS IDEAL SPREADING TO AND THAT WAS TAKING STE FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO. I'M NOT WE'VE DONE THE NEXT START TO ALSO START BY. TWENTY IS C. A. ACTION THE SEE EXAMPLES FIND SECOND WHICH WOULD THEN NEED TO SNAP AND I DO BY IS IN MY IN ONE OF THE DEFINING TREND THAT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO PERSON THAT'S GOING TO CHIU HOW BE YOU IN PERCEIVED THESE AND RELEASED ON NEW APPS THAT NETWORK UP WITH. THERE ARE MANY OTHER NORMAL USE CASES MIGHT OFMY ESTEEMED FELLOW BY ABILITY SHEDDING AS I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT THUNDER THEY'RE I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH SPECIFIC USE CASE OF HIGH G. WHICH THE PASSED UP ON BRIEFLY IN EARLIER IN THE DAY SESSION HI THIS IS DUONG HELP THE UNCONNECTED THANK THIS THE IMPORTANT OF BROAD ACCESS. BE STILL HAVE MILLIONS ALSO AROUND THE I'M IN THE STATE OF LACK ACCESS TO OF THE IS FOR DOUBLE HI SPEED WHY OF RIGHT AND THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE LARGEST LET'S THE SPENT SO THIS IS A SIGNAL CHALLENGES SPANS BOTH URBAN AND RURAL REGIONS OF STATE I ONE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WHY IS THIS A FOR IN ONLY OTHER JUST IT'S THE COUNTRY BUT I THINK THE REAL CHIU IS THE LACK OF BLOOD INFRASTRUCTURE IN MANY OF THE REGIONS THE BIG A BARRIER I'M IS THAT LACK OF BROADBAND ZERO IT IS TO DEPLOY I THOUGHT I SAID TODAY GONNA AND AGAIN I DON'T OF THIS THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR GO A MUCH THAN THAT OF BECOMES NATURAL BARRIER SOMETIMES YEAH AND DOESN'T HAVE MONEY CAN TO SO I KNOW BUT I MENTIONED EARLIER FUTURE FIVE NETWORKS THANK SO D. D. WOULD BE MUCH INCOME BIG BY VIRTUE OF SO BASED AND ALSO BEING CHEAP TO ALL AND RUN GIVES A LOT FOR. I MEAN ASPECT OF TECHNOLOGY ASK THAT IT IS ABOUT FOUNDER IS NOTIONAL INTENDED I AND BACK NO BY ONLY WHILE NETWORK IS CONNECTED BY A Y. ON THE BACK MORE. THAN NOT A TWO OFFEND UP CABLE FOR. THAT COMES A LITTLE BIT THE BEST ACTION THE MOBILE PHONE THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF THE NOW THE RUNNING OF YOU NEED TO GET RID CROSS AND CONFIRM IT NOT THAT'S A THAT IS THAT IT MAKES ME THE COST THE X. DEPOSITS NETWORKS ONE FIVE NETWORK STANDARDS ARE TRYING TO DO IS GET TO BE INCORPORATED OF THE TO ACCESS AND LET WAY BACK CALL IT SEVEN FIVE THINK CAN BE THANK YOU CAN BE THE LIGHT CAN BE FOR WHAT PROTECTING YOURSELF DIRECTLY AND ALSO YOU HAVE THIS TO STOCK. OTHER BITS. THE SCHOOL WE HAD TO ADDRESS. THE CHALLENGES OF BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY. PROVIDED LOTS OF BAKER GLANCED ONTO TEAMS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND CITY LEADERS TO REACH THEM USING SOME OF THESE SERVICES NOW BY JESUS THE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DEPRIVED OF TO BE DEPLOYED BE HARD- BEGIN IS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE. ENABLE ON THAT POINT. OR SOME OF THE COLLECTIVE CHANCE MIGHT BE TO SEE SIMILAR GAINS AGAIN. REGIONS THAT ARE EXTREMELY RUDE AND ALSO TRYING TO THE BEST SO FOR EXAMPLE. BE FUNDED A PROJECT OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA WELL THE TRYING TO PROJECT WHICH TRIES TO BRING FOSTER ROBIN HOOD ACCESS USING A RANGE OF SPECTRUM BANDS THAT TRADITIONALLY ARE NOT USED. FOR OTHER REGULAR FOOD UNIT. RIGHT I THINK FIVE G. NETWORKS ARE GOING TO BE INCORPORATING MANY OF THOSE ASPECTS BOSTON SHEDDING USING WHITE SPACES AND- YOU KNOW OUR ADVICE AXLES SO IN THE NAME A FEW TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SPECTRUM OF THEIR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA THAT CAN BE CARRIED ON THE STATE'S. ALL OF SARDO OF THE CHALLENGE IS DOUBLE WHAT HAS BEEN OF MORMON I MENTIONED THE BACKLOG THE NEXT LOCAL SO CAN BE BACK OF THE NAY BOOK IT'S CAN BE LETTER LINKS WE NEED IN TO ALLOW WHICH ON THAT ME RIGHT SO ONE MAY I WHY DID TAKE SO LONG TO FIGURE TO GET THAT WHAT BACKHAUL WHAT NOT HAVE FOR G. I DON'T HAVE A GOOD. DAY BYE HE'S JUST MAKING A I G. B. ONE B. TWO THAT ARE MORE OPTIONS WE HAVE STAFF BEEN A BE A MINI THIS OPTIONS ARE COMING. SB GOING TO BE TESTING A RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON- STONES PRECISION AGRICULTURE- INPUT CROP AND LIVESTOCK. FARMS AND THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE LOOKING AT EDUCATION- OTHER OPTIONS IN THE WORLD YES. WHAT KIND OF ADVANCED AFFORDABLE BROADBAND OPTIONS THAT MAY HELP SO AND I THINK AS I MENTIONED BEFORE AN EMERGING USE SB SENATE HAS NOTHING LIKE THE COLOR NO MATTER WHAT KIND USED AS WE COME UP WITH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE EXTREME DISRUPTIVE BUT DOESN'T TAKE US ALL BACK TO THE STUDENTS RIGHT A LESSON THAT I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY FROM HOW TO CONSOLIDATE YOU HAVE CITY WAS IF YOU WHEN YOU LOST POWER. BUT THREE DAYS BEAVER HELLO AND THIS WAS LIKE CAN YEARS AGO AND NOT IN THE IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING TODAY AND THE STATE OF OUR OFFENSE MAY. BE ONE DOLLAR NETWORKS TO BE EXTENDING HIS LEAD AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PIECE OF A FIVE G. AND WHATEVER COMES NEXT. AND THE LAUNCH OF THE JUST LAUNCHED A NEW PROGRAM IN THE REGION NEXT EXISTENCE PROGRAM ALL GRAINS WHICH IS TRYING TO ISOLATE ASSAD'S WILL HELP MAKE OUR NETWORKS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY RELIABLE AND RESILIENT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AND YET THE L. PARTNERSHIPS MANY COMPANIES THAT ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS WILL X. AND- TO NAME A FEW I AM THE END B. OVER AND THE ARE HOPING TO SOME OF SIERRA UP I'LL JUST I'M UP WITH INTO OPTIONS MAKE A IDEA SYSTEMS EXPERIENCE AND RESILIENT SO THEY CAN DO ON THE PROMISE THAT THE OFFERING US SO VP THAT THE EMERGENCE UP JUST GIVE OF G. R. ALL GOING TO COME OVER THROUGH A STRONG OF BY WORKING WITH AND COURSE I'LL LOOKS LIKE AND NO TRYING TO HOPE THAT AS I CAN BECAUSE AND THE THING THAT THEY CAN HELP SIGNATURE IN FACT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL REMEMBER TO MAKE IT TO REMEMBER THE UNDER GET AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE I'VE BEEN GOING ALL THESE THE ADMISSION OF THE THERE ARE ALL OF CITY EQUITY ACCOUNTED. I AM GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS PANELS ABOUT FIVE G. USE CASES I AM GOING TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE CALL THE EIGHT CURRENCIES ARE FIVE G. WHAT MAKES IT SUCH A TECHNOLOGY SO POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIONAL ACROSS A RANGE OF. CONSUMER BUSINESS ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS. I DON'T WANT TO BURY THE LEAD. AND I WANT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS THE ASSEMBLY. WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY. IS POISED TO SOLVE. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THE LAST MILE PROBLEM IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS. IN LARGE PART. AND THIS HAS BEEN A GOAL. OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY. SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT. WHERE CONGRESS AND POLICYMAKERS DREAMED OF A TIME. WHEN THE MAJOR CARRIERS AND TECHNOLOGIES WOULD COME TOGETHER. AND BE ABLE TO COMPETE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. TO ACTUALLY SERVED- UBIQUITOUSLY. AND I SAY THAT WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY IS POISED TO SOLVE THE LAST MILE. WORKS TO SERVE- ARE OUR CITIZENS AND OUR OUR PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND AMERICA- D. BROADBAND PROVIDERS. FOR THE LAST YOU KNOW TWELVE YEARS OR LONGER. HAVE BEEN AT OR NEAR THE TOP. OF THE PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE'S AMIR AMERICAN INVESTMENT HEROES LIST THE COMPANIES THAT ARE INVESTING THE MOST CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN AMERICA- IT'S VERY COSTLY TO DIG UP THE STREETS THE SIDEWALKS TO DEPLOY THE FIBER- AND GET THESE- RADIO ACCESS NETWORKS BUILT. UBIQUITOUSLY AND SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO LOWER THOSE COSTS TO SO THAT WE CAN PUSH BROADBAND OUT TO EVERYONE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GOAL- TELECOMMUNICATIONS AT LEAST SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT. AND TRADITIONALLY- WE YOU KNOW WE DEAL WITH THE INCUMBENTS RIGHT WE DO IT WITH YOU NOW WITH THE INCUMBENT TELEPHONE OR INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER YOU KNOW BUILDING- FIBER- YOU KNOW- WHETHER IT'S TO THE CURB TO THE PREMISE- YOU DO IT THROUGH THE CABLE COMPANY WHICH BUILDS COAXIAL. CABLE AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO- WIRE THAT ALL THE WAY TO THE END USERS PREMISE RIGHT THE HOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESS OR THE LARGE ENTERPRISE. SO THE BIG- THE BIG DEAL HERE IS THAT WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY. WITH FIVE G. IS NOW POLL TO ALLOW US TO DELIVER THAT LAST MILE STREET THE SIDEWALK. THE LAST MILE TO THE CUSTOMER'S PREMISE WIRELESSLY. OKAY NOW YOU MIGHT SAY HEY I COULD DO THAT TODAY WITH FOUR G. AND YES THAT'S TRUE FOUR G. REALLY PAVED THE WAY FOR FIVE G. TAKE YOURSELF BACK TEN YEARS AGO WHEN FOUR G. WAS IN ITS INFANCY PRIOR TO TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE STILL MAILING DVDS TO NETFLIX. OR AMAZON WAS JUST BEING BORN AS A COMPANY AS AN ONLINE SHOPPING PORTAL RIGHT IT REGIONALLY SOLD BOOKS NOW WITH FOUR G. AND THE MEGABIT LEVEL CONNECTIVITY THAT IT GIVES YOU ANYWHERE THERE IS A SIGNAL YOU COULD STREAM NETFLIX WHEREVER YOU COULD ORDER AMAZON WHEREVER AMAZON WEB SERVICES HAS. THRIVED IT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY ORGY IS TRANSFORMED OUR LIVES FIVE G. IS GOING TO TAKE THAT TO THE NEXT LEVEL SO AND THE OTHER PART ABOUT FOUR G. IS THE CAPACITY OF FOUR G. NETWORKS IS LIMITED AND ITS CONSTRAINT. SO WHILE TODAY YOU CAN GET YOUR BROADBAND FROM LTE FOUR G. LTE THERE'S ONLY SO MANY LANES ON THE HIGHWAY RIGHT WHICH IS WHY WE NEED SMALL CELLS TO BUILD OUT THE CAPACITY ABOUT NETWORK AND BUILD MORE LANES TO THE FOUR G. LTE HIGHWAY. AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE USE THEIR SMARTPHONES FOR VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING BUT STILL THERE ARE DATA CAPS THERE ARE LIMITS THAT THE NETWORK PROVIDERS HAVE TO PUT ON THE CAPACITY OF THAT NETWORK SO THAT IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. CALLED NETWORK MANAGEMENT FIVE G. WHAT MAKES IT SO TRANSFORMATIONAL IS THE SPECTRUM AND I'M GONNA GO TO THE CURRENCIES THAT WERE USING PLASTIC FIBER TRANSPORT IT BACK CALL UPGRADES THAT ARE NEEDED. ARE GONNA MAKE THOSE DATA CAPS OF THING OF THE PAST. SO WITH FIVE G. EVERYONE'S ASKING RIGHT WHAT'S THE KILLER APP GOING TO BE FOR FIVE G. IS GOING TO BE SMART CITIES IS GONNA BE A. R. B. R. IS GOING TO BE. BE ME UP SCOTTY. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT THE TRUE KILLER APP FOR RIGHT NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THIS TIME. IS BROADBAND FIVE G. IS GOING TO DELIVER A THIRD HEIGHT IF YOU WILL. FOR HOME AND SMALL BUSINESS BROADBAND. IN COMPETITION WITH THE INCUMBENT TELEPHONE IN THE INCUMBENT CABLE COMPANIES. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE TRANSFORMATIONAL POWER OF FIVE G. AND THE REASON WHY IT'S A TRANSFORMATIONAL ARE BECAUSE OF WHAT WE CALL THE EIGHT CURRENCIES A FIVE YEAR THE CAPABILITIES OF FIVE G. SO. I YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT THIS SPECTRUM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIMETER WAVE HIGH BAND SPECTRUM OF MID BAND SPECTRUM. IT'S NOT NEW WE HAVE BEEN USING- MICROWAVE TRANSPORT. FOR GENERATIONS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO TRANSPORT LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER WHERE IT'S REALLY HARD TO BUILD FIBRE LIKE OUT IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES- ALONG. THREE NINETY FIVE- UP IN NOR CAL OR ALONG THE COAST- UP IN NOR CAL- BUT- AS A LAST MILE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS WHERE FIVE G. IS REALLY TRANSFORMATIONAL. SO THE SPECTRUM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH FIVE G. BOTH THE MID BAND SPECTRUM. WHICH IS THE SUBTEXT GIGAHERTZ AND THEN THE HIGH BAND SPECTRUM THE MILLIMETER WAVE SPECTRUM. HAS EIGHT CAPABILITIES- THAT ALSO DEPEND ON HAVING A ROBUST FIBER. BACKHAUL AND TRANSPORT YEAH SEVEN NOT MATT HOW THIS SIGNAL GETS TO YOU IT'S JUST THE LAST MILE THAT IS WIRELESS THE MIDDLE MILE AND THE FIRST MILE IS ALL FIBER MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF FIBER SO WE USED TO DEPLOY FIBER CABLES AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR CARE BUT LIKE. REALLY TINY NOW IF YOU IF YOU WALK BY ANY INSTALLATION WHERE WE'RE PUTTING FIBER WE'RE PUTTING A THOUSAND HAIR FIBER. CABLE YEAH THAT'S THE LARGER THAN THE FIRST INTER CONTINENTAL C. CABLE THAT TRANSPORTED ALL THE DATA FROM NORTH AMERICA ASIA RIGHT IT'S HUGE AND REPORTING THAT AND EVERYWHERE TO BACK UP ITS NETWORK. BUT FOR FIVE G. WHAT MAKES FIVE G. WIRELESS RADIO FREQUENCY SPECTRUM SO I'M BASING ARE THE EIGHT CURRENCIES WE CALL IT AND SO I'LL GO THROUGH THEM REALLY QUICKLY YOU'VE ALREADY CUT. YOU KNOW HEARD IT FROM THE PRIOR PANEL BUT- THE THROUGHPUT OR THE SPEEDS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH FIVE G. SO THINK OF THE FOUR GLT IS GIVING YOU MEGABIT LEVEL CONNECTIVITY WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD YOU COULD STREAM NETFLIX RIGHT YOU CAN. DO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE. FIVE G. IS GOING TO GET. GIGABIT LEVEL CONNECTIVITY AND SOME OF YOU MAY SAY WELL I'M REALLY NEED TO GET TO MY PHONE. AND YEAH THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE FOR RIGHT NOW. BUT PEOPLE NEED A GIG TO THEIR HOMES OR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT'S AGAIN THE KILLER APP FOR FIVE G. PEOPLE THINK OF FIVE G. AS MOBILE RIGHT. YES IT'S MOBILE BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO ENABLE FIXED WIRELESS ACCESS INSTALLING A NODE MUCH MUCH SMALLER THAN A SATELLITE DISH LOOKS LIKE A WIFI BOX ON YOUR ROOF. OR YOUR WINDOW AND THAT ALLOWS THE FIVE G. SIGNAL TO BE PROPAGATED ARE BEAMED TO YOUR HOME OR SMALL BUSINESS. THAT'S THE LAST MILE AND TALKING ABOUT SO YOU GET GIGABIT LEVEL SPEEDS. FIVE G. HOME- OR FIVE G. SMALL BUSINESS- THE PRIOR PANEL TALKED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL- IT- THE GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS SO THE SERVICE DEPLOYMENT IS THE SECOND CAPABILITY. OF FIVE G. IT'S ALSO CALLED NETWORK VIRTUALISATION. SO THINK OF IT IS INSTEAD OF IF SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THIS FAST RADIO ACCESS NETWORK THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD THE TO CONNECT EVERYBODY. SOMETHING HAPPENS WAY OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD TAKE SOMETIMES MONTHS FOR THE ENGINEERING TEAM TO GO OUT. AND FIND A HARDWARE THAT IS CAUSING THAT PROBLEM. WITH FIVE G. SERVICE DEPLOYMENT AND NETWORK VIRTUALISATION BACK IT HAPPENED BY THE SOFTWARE CAN HAPPEN ELECTRONICALLY. SO WHAT WOULD IT TAKE MONTHS. WOULD NOW TAKE DAYS OR EVEN HOURS TO FIX THE PROBLEM IN THE NETWORK SOMEWHERE SO YOU HAVE THAT AMAZING SERVICE DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITY. THE THIRD CURRENCY IS MOBILITY RIGHT SO WE EXPECT YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT FIXED WIRELESS ACCESS FIVE G. HOME BEING THE KILLER APP- MOBILITY- IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR- SAFETY AND ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE. WHEN YOU'RE GOING ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA USED TO GO TO TAHOE LIKE IT'S GOT ZERO BARS NOW WE GO TO TAHOE AND I GET FOUR BARS IF YOU'RE HIKING YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO CALL NINE ONE ONE. MOBILITY FIVE G. IS GOING TO ENHANCE THE SPEEDS THE COVERAGE IN THE CAPACITY OF THE MOBILE NETWORK. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO WORK AT FIVE HUNDRED KILLER KILOMETERS PER HOUR OR THREE HUNDRED TEN MILES PER HOUR SO THINK OF. HIGH SPEED TRAINS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS FIVE G. I VERY HIS YOURSELF. GOING AT HIGH VERY HIGH SPEEDS THIS CURRENT IS DATA BAR OR THE CUT I TALKED ABOUT THE LAW ON A RIGHT SO YOU HAVE COVERAGE DO I HAVE COVERAGE IN THIS AREA RIGHT YES I'M IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT NOW YES I HAVE COVERAGE. BUT IF EVERYONE GETS ON THE NETWORK AT THE SAME TIME THAT DOES THE BECOME A COVERAGE PROBLEM APPLICANTS THE CAPACITY PROBLEM. IS BY GETTING IN AN ELEVATOR THERE'S ONLY SO MANY PEOPLE THAT CAN GET IT. SO WITH WITH FIVE G. THE CAPACITY OF THE DATA VOLUME IS TEN TERABYTES PER. SECOND PER SQUARE KILOMETER THAT'S HUGE IF YOU THINK OF THE PRIOR PANEL TALKING ABOUT EVERY PAYING WITH A CHIP IN IT. BEING CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET GOING FORWARD. MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF THE VOLUMES BEING CONNECTED TO THE TO THE INTERNET AS WE GO FORWARD WE HAVE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THESE NETWORKS. AND THIS RESPECTABLE OUT THAT THAT HAPPENED. THE SEVENTH. AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CAPABILITY OUR CURRENCY OF FIVE G. IS THE ULTRA LOW LATENCY. LATENCY ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A GAMER OR IF YOUR KIDS ARE GAMERS. YOU MIGHT HEAR THEM GLITCHED OUT OR THEY PUSH THE BUTTON TO FIRE AND THEN A SECOND LATER IT FIRES ARE YOU HAVE A OUR VR GOGGLES ON. IF YOU DON'T HAVE VERY VERY LOW LATENCY WHICH IS THE TIME IT TAKES FOR YOUR DEVICE TO YOU PUSH YOUR DEVICE TO DO SOMETHING AND IT DOESN'T IT NEEDS TO BE BLINK OF AN EYE OR IF YOU HAVE THAT AS A OUR VR GOGGLES ON YOU'RE GONNA GET KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE LIKE. WAY OUT OF WHACK SO THE EXTREMELY LOW BLINK OF AN EYE LATENCY IS THE CAPABILITY OF FIVE G. AND THEN OF COURSE THE EIGHT CURRENCY THAT WE HAVE. IS ULTRA HIGH SERVICE RELIABILITY AND WE TALKED YOU KNOW THE PANEL TALKED ABOUT HOW IT CREDIBLY IMPORTANT. NETWORK RESILIENCY AND RELIABILITY IS AS WE DEPEND ON THESE NETWORKS FOR EVERYTHING TO LIVE TO WORK TO ACCESS PUBLIC SAFETY. TELEHEALTH AND DISTANCE LEARNING. SO I HOPE THAT PROVIDED A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR UP TO FIVE G. THE KILLER APP IS BROADBAND. AND THE WORK CHAIRMAN THAT YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR DID. TO DELIVER THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR BROADBAND PACKAGE IS. GOING TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL. IF WE CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK WITH OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GET THOSE PERMITS THROUGH. IT THE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. WE DON'T WANT THAT MONEY TO BE WASTED TO GET SHOVELS IN THE GROUND WE ALSO NEED LOCAL WERE FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MYSTERY AS FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- YES MANY OF US HERE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAST MILE. OF PROBLEMS AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT FIVE G. COULD BE IT OR IS THE SOLUTION TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM. I WITH THAT- LET US GO TO OUR LAST PANELIST AND- FOR THIS PANEL. DO WHICH IS UP MR CHRIS BOYER WHO IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL SECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY. WITH A TNT SO MISTER BOYER. FLOORS YOURS. YES SOME OF THE NUMBER OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY- I'M CHRIS WHERE WITH EIGHTEEN T. AND- MY EXPERTISE IS REALLY ON THE SECURITY SIDE OF FIVE USE SOMEONE TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT SINCE. OUR PANEL IS ALSO FOCUSED A LITTLE BIT ON A DIFFERENT USE CASES AND- AROUND FIVE YEAH I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST START OUT START OFF BY TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE USE CASES WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. HERE IN WASHINGTON WITH VARIOUS ASPECTS F THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO- I THINK SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS- DR- NOT A COUPLE AND OTHERS- AND RUDY ALSO SPOKE ABOUT THIS ISSUE BUT THE REAL BENEFITS OF FIVE G. R. THE LOWER LATENCY THE MASSIVE CONNECTIVITY IN THE FASTER SPEEDS ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS COMBINED. ARE WHAT REALLY MAKE UP THE USE CASES AND THE BENEFITS ARE GOING TO SEE WITH FIVE G. IT'S A DEPEND UPON- THE USE CASE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS. BUT I THINK I THINK THE MAIN POINT HERE IS THAT FIVE G. IS REALLY NOT ABOUT- JUST A CONSUMER GETTING YOU KNOW FASTER ACCESS TO THEIR FAVORITE VIDEO STREAMING SERVICE RIGHT THERE FOUND IT'S REALLY ABOUT. A LOT OF THESE APPLICATIONS THAT CAN BE ENABLED BY THAT COMBINATION OF SPEAKING ACTIVITY AND- AND LATENCY- AND SO YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT FOUR G. I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY- A MAGIC IN THAT. THE KILLER APP FOR FOUR G. WOULD BE THINGS LIKE THE GIG ECONOMY OR UBER BUT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF APPLICATIONS THAT WE REALLY SAW TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE FASTER SPEED BEFORE CHEATING AND SO WITH FIVE G. WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT A LOT OF THESE- APPLICATIONS MIGHT BE ESPECIALLY IN THE ENTERPRISE SPACE BUT I THINK ON THE CONSUMER SIDE. YOU KNOW THE- FIVE G. WILL DO IS IT'LL JUMPSTART. A WAVE OF THE UNFORESEEN INNOVATION THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO PREDICT RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TODAY- SOME COUPLE GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE. YOU AT AND T. WE OPENED UP A FIVE G. INNOVATION STUDIO- APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUT THAT'S REALLY INTENDED TO DO IS XCELERATED PATH. TO MARKET FOR NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN IN OTHER IT IS I JUST A COUPLE OF THE OF USE CASE THAT WORK LOOKING AT AND AT RIDICULOUS INTERVENTIONS ONE IS IDEA OF A DRONE CAN SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MICROSOFT AS YOUR- YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR THAT MEASURE IT'S THE MICROSOFT CLOUD PLATFORM- IN THE DRONE COMPANY EVA- TO EVALUATE HOW OUR FIVE G. NETWORK COMBINED WITH EDGE COMPUTING. CAN ALLOW FOR NEAR TIME DRONE CONTROL EVEN EVEN BEYOND VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT TO COULD YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FIVE G. NETWORK TO CONTROL DRONES. BEYOND THE VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT IN THIS IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING EIGHTEEN T. BECAUSE- WE HAVE A LOT OF PUBLIC SAFETY CUSTOMERS WE HAVE TO USE DRONES AND- THE PAST RECOVERY SITUATIONS AND MONITORING THE NETWORK SO- I UNDERSTAND HOW IT USED THE FIVE G. NETWORK TO CONTROL DRONES IS AN ISSUE THAT- IS IT IS THE USE CASE THAT WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN- ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS HOLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS- THIS IS REALLY A CONSUMER APPLICATION BUT- YOU KNOW IN DECEMBER. EIGHTEENTH IN ERICSSON WE WORK TOGETHER ON. THE RAINY. ET HEARSE OF HOLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION WITHOUT THE TYPE OF HARDWARE THE TECHNOLOGY TYPICALLY REQUIRES SO WE CAN USE. THE COMBINATION OF FIVE G. A. I. IN SOME OF THE- MOBILE AND COMPUTING FUNCTIONALITY- THE DOCTOR NEED TO CALL TALK SPOKE ABOUT. YOU KNOW WITH THE- STANDARD FIVE G. SMARTPHONE TO DELIVER. YOU KNOW HOLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION ARE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES SO THAT'S- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE JUST TESTING IS VERY MUCH IN THE- INITIAL STAGES BUT WE DO THINK THAT SOMETHING IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR. A MASS CONSUMER ADOPTION SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD- ALSO WORKING ON SMART MANUFACTURING AND SO- YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THINGS- IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING THAT REALLY TRANSFORMS THAT- YOU KNOW WE KEEP WE CAN COMBINE. YOU KNOW FIVE G. WITH EDGE COMPUTING FUNCTIONALITY- TO PROVIDE SMART SAFETY DEVICES FOR MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A- A SMART FIVE G. A MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IN AUSTIN WITH WITH- WITH SAM SONG IT'S A GREAT. DEMONSTRATION OF FIVE G. MANUFACTORY I SEEN DIED THAT ILLUSTRATE HOW CAN LIVE BECAUSE YOU COULD PUSH THE COMPUTE FUNCTION FIVE G. WITH ALL THAT YOU KNOW CLOSER TO THE YOU CAN ACTUALLY UP WITH THAT WHERE FOR EXAMPLE THE CRITICAL DATA THAT USED TO RUNA MANUFACTURING PLANT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY. IS SELF CONTAINED ON THE PREMISE YOU CAN PUT THE COMPUTE FUNCTIONALITY ON TREND. IN THE CALL YOU KNOW IN A CALL IN A AN ON PREM SERVER CLOUD ENVIRONMENT WE AN KEEP THAT DATA. CONFINED TO THE TO THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND ONLY ALLOW YOU KNOW THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY LIKE LET'S SAY AN EMPLOYEE WANTS TO GO CHECK THEIR EMAIL OR SOMETHING. AND THEY HAVE TO GO ON THE PUBLIC INTERNET THAT YOU CAN REALLY START TO. DO THINGS TOO- DIVIDE UP TRAFFIC AND ENSURE THAT SEEKS THAT REALLY- IMPORTANT TRAFFIC NEVER LEAVES THE- MANUFACTURING LOCATION BY LEVERAGING A COMBINATION OF FIVE G. AND OTHER. TECHNOLOGIES SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING HERE- THAT WE THINK WILL BE- YOU KNOW REALLY CHANGE HOW MANUFACTURING WORKS- IS IMMENSE AND SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON. IN ON THE CONSUMER SIDE YOU KNOW I MENTIONED HOW THE GRAPHICS BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER APPLICATIONS. YOU KNOW GAMINI E. SPORTS TRAVEL APPLICATIONS ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU WILL KNOW WHEN WE SEE IT RIGHT A LOT OF THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN. OVER TIME- NETWORKS GOING TO BE BUILT OUT AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL SEE IS A LOT OF THE INNOVATORS FRANKLY- YOU KNOW I SPENT THREE YEARS IN. SILICON VALLEY WORKING FOR EIGHTEEN T. AND- YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF THE INNOVATORS THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WILL ULTIMATELY. BE WORKING ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO ON TOP OF. THE BENEFITS THAT RECEIVE A FIVE G. TERMS OF BROADBAND. AND LATENCY- THAT'S KIND OF JUST WILL RESPECT ON YOU TO BE OUR YES HERE TO SEE SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ENTIRE LIFE BASED WORKING ON SECURING ISSUES FIVE G. NETWORKS- YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FIVE G. SECURITY. YEAH WHEN I THINK ABOUT SECURITY IS NOT JUST THE NETWORK RIGHT NOW I THINK- SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS TOUCHED ON THIS. SECURITY IS REALLY ABOUT EACH ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE NETWORK RIGHTS SO. THE NETWORK IS NOT JUST LIKE THE PART THAT WE MADE CHANGES EIGHTEEN T. BUT IT INCLUDES THE DEVICES. IT INCLUDES THE APPLICATION LAYER THAT'S IN THE CLOUD. SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO SECURE ALL OF THAT- BUT AT. THE BOTTOM LINE FOR FIVE G. IS THAT IT WILL BE. THE MOST ADVANCED OUR MOST SECURE NETWORK. OUR GENERATION OF WIRELESS THAT WE'VE DEPLOYED TODAY- AND THAT'S PREDOMINANTLY BECAUSE FIVE G. IS BEING DESIGNED WITH SECURITY IN MIND. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE PAST INSECURITIES BEEN WORKABLE TIME- BUT I THINK STARTING WITH WITH FOUR G. LTE NOW SPECIFICALLY WITH FIVE G. THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON FIRE ON SECURITY- YOU KNOW. IN THE ECOSYSTEM IN THE STANDARDS BODIES THEMSELVES SO. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT. FIVE G. SECURITY IS BEING ADDRESSED AT THREE GP THREE GPP IS THE- IS THE STANDARDS BODY THAT'S OFFICIALLY DEVELOPING THE STANDARDS FOR FIVE G. THEY HAVE A DEDICATED WORKING GROUP FOR FIVE G. SECURITY. CALLED THREE GPP AS A THREE. SB WHAT IT'S DOING ITS TACKLE YOU KNOW KI&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOR. IN THE STANDARD AND&lt;/c&gt; LESSONS FROM SO THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS PROCESS IS VERY. URGENT SO WHEN SECURITY ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED YOU CAN TAKE IN THREE GPP. STANDARDS BODY WILL WORK ON. A NEW STANDARDS IN DIFFERENT- SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE PUT IN PLACE TO- TO IMPROVE FIVE G. SECURITY. AND THEN THEY CAN UPDATE THE STANDARD SO EFFECTIVELY. YOU HAVE YOU KNOW FIVE G. SECURITY. BUILT INTO THIS INTO THE FIVE G. WIRELESS STANDARDS THEMSELVES- SO THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR THE INDUSTRY AND WE THINK THAT THAT LEADS TO. A SUBSTANTIAL SECURITY BENEFITS OVER TIME. THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF- ARCHITECTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FIVE G. AND FOUR G. THAT IMPACT THE NETWORK IT WILL GIVE US NEW SECURITY CAPABILITIES- SO I THINK- I THINK ON SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS TOUCHED ON THIS BUT- YOU KNOW FIVE G. REALLY INTRODUCES THE NEW NETWORK SEGMENT THE MOBILE ADS. THAT WILL ENABLE YOU NEXT GENERATION I MISS IS ALSO LEASING HAVING WITH APPLICATIONS BUT- THE NETWORK GETS REALLY INCLUDES SOME OF THE COMPUTE FUNCTIONALITY. THAT WAS TRADITIONALLY PART OF THE CORE PARTS OF THE NETWORK YOU CAN THINK OF A TRADITIONAL WIRELESS NETWORK YOU HAD. YOU HAVE THE DEVICE THAT CONNECTS TO A CELL TOWER. TO CELL TOWER HAS FIBER BACKHAUL THAT GOES TO- YOU KNOW A CENTRALIZED LOCATION WHERE THE CORE NETWORK RESIDES. NOT IN THAT COURT NUMBER CONNECTS TO THE INTERNET. YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE PAST A LOT OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT WERE. THAT WERE RIGHT ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE. WE'RE ALL COMING OFF THE INTERNET YOU CONNECTED TO THE CORE. IT'S SO THE COMPUTE FUNCTIONALITY ALL RESIDED IN THE CORE OR EVEN ON THE INTERNET ITSELF ON THE PUBLIC INTERNET SO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE NETWORK. YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET TO. WHERE THE APPLICATION IS BEING RUN- YOU KNOW WITH MOBILE EDGE COMPUTING YOU NOW ARE RUNNING THOSE APPLICATIONS CLOSER CLOSER TO THE EDGE. SO BY SHORTEN THAT DISTANCE THE AMOUNT OF. THE AMOUNT OF- THERE THE DISTANCE THAT THE- DEVICE HAS TO TRAVEL TO GET TO THE COMPUTER. KNOWLEDGE THAT'S WHAT'S GOOD THAT'S WHAT GIVES YOU. THE LOWER LATENCY BENEFITS. THAT YOU SEE WITH FIVE G. BUT THERE'S OTHER BENEFITS THAT IS WHY AS THE BEST NAKED FUNCTION CLOSER THE EDGE WE CAN NOW DO YOU THAT WE SHOULD BE DID IN THE OF THE NET FIRST WE CAN NO THOSE FUNCTION HAS SOFTWARE IN THE EDGE OF THE NETWORK SO. FOR EXAMPLE WE DO A LOT OF- DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK DETECTION- WE CAN LOOK FOR THINGS LIKE EXFILTRATION EVENTS OF DATA- THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE MONITOR THE NETWORK FOR. JUDICIAL RECORD THE NETWORKS OF MORE FURTHER BACK IN THE NETWORK NOW WE CAN SHIFT A LOT OF THAT CAPABILITY. CLOSER TO THE EDGE. WORKS WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE SOME OF THE ATTACKS HAPPENING. YOU KNOW CLOSER TO THE USER WHICH ALLOWS US TO- YOU KNOW PINPOINT EARN ARE NARROWED DOWN THE SCOPE OF THESE ATTACKS. AND REALLY TRY TO ADDRESS THEM CLOSER TO THOSE USERS BEFORE THEY GET BACK INTO THE BROADER PARTS OF THE NETWORK. OR WE CAN MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF DATA. THAT'S BEING DISRUPTED THERE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY AFFECTING A SMALL SET OF USERS RECEIVE GETTING BACK INTO THE CORE PART OF THE NETWORK. WHERE IT REALLY AFFECTS OF A MUCH BROADER BASE OF THE TRAFFIC- SO THAT SO I THINK THAT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN ARCHITECTURE BY MOVING THAT. THAT FUNCTIONALITY CLOSER TO THE USER TO THE ADS. ACTUALLY GIVES US- QUITE A BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO BUILDING SECURITY. INTO THE NETWORK ITSELF- THERE'S ALSO SOME ENHANCEMENTS TO SECURITY AND FIVE G. I CAN IMAGINE A LOT OF THIS IS COMING THROUGH THE STANDARDS. SO ONE OF THEM IS. IT IS ARE ALL NETWORK IF YOU CAN STOP JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE'S OTHER THINGS GOING ON WITH DEVICES. AND APPLICATIONS BUT NOT REPEAT ITSELF LIKE EIGHTEEN TO HEAR OTHERS MANAGED. OTHER SOME VERY SPECIFIC THINGS ARE HAPPENING SO- THE THREE GPP. STANDARDS CALL FOR- STRONGER ENCRYPTION OF THE OVER THE AIR INTERFACE- THAT WILL ENHANCE SECURITY BETWEEN. THE FIVE MOBILE DEVICE TO THE NETWORK SO IN THE PAST- A LOT OF THE DATA SENT BETWEEN THE MOBILE DEVICE IN THE NETWORK LIKE WHEN YOUR DEVICE IS AUTHENTICATING. ON THE NETWORK AND TRANSMITTING DATA BETWEEN YOUR PHONE. AND THE TOWER- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THAT DATA WAS SENT IN THE CLEAR- THIS WILL NOT BE ENCRYPTED- SO WHAT'S CALLED THE IN THE- INFORMATION ON THE WIRELESS NETWORK WITHOUT. BEING CORRECTED SO. THAT OVER THE INTERFACING WITH THE FIVE G. STANDARD THAT FIVE G. INTRODUCES THE NEWS ADDS ARE PROTECTION CALLED AS PPO SEVERAL THAT PROTECTS ROLE MEAN FOR. SO THAT THAT RELIEF THE ACTUALLY BETWEEN THE BY WHEN THEY WERE ACROSS AND THAT WILL ALLOW US TO IN THIS NEW PROTECTION PROXY WILL ALLOW US TO INTRODUCE- NEW BETTER MITIGATIONS AGAINST WHAT ARE CALLED SIGNALLY ATTACKS OF THINGS LIKE SS SEVEN AND DIAMETER TAX. SO IS HIS WHERE IS A ROAMING BETWEEN CARRIERS NETWORKS- FIVE G. ALSO INTRODUCES A SUBSCRIBER IDENTITY PRIVACY- YOU SEE THE SUBSCRIPTION- CONCEALED IDENTIFIER WHICH REALLY DESIGNED- TO CONCEAL AND PROTECT A FIVE YEAR SUBSCRIPTION AND IN A FIRE WHICH COULD HELP MITIGATE THE VULNERABILITY IN THE CATCHER SO I DON'T A LOT OF TECHNICAL. PROBABLY GET BUT IF YOU THINK BUT WE DIDN'T THE CATCHER IS BASICALLY A SCENARIO WHERE- YOU THINK OF LIKE I'VE EVER HEARD OF A BICYCLE THE STING RAY WHERE SOMEONE CAN COME IN AND KIND OF- SPOOF THE NETWORK AND TRY TO GET YOU TO CONNECT TO THE STINGRAY DEVICE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOUR DATA- BY BY CONCEALING THOSE IDENTIFIERS IN THE COMBINATION OF SOME OF THE- OVER THEIR INTERFACE YOU COULD IMAGINE. PREVIOUSLY WE CAN EFFECTIVELY FOR WORKS- THE USES OF SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF DEVICES. IN THE COUNTRY'S GOING FORWARD WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE WE FOLLOW- MOBILE SECURITY- WITHOUT ABILITY- THERE'S ALSO INCREASED HOME NETWORK CONTROL- FOR AUTHENTICATION ON THE FIVE G. NETWORKS AND VERIFYING THAT DEVICE IS PRESENT THE REQUESTED SERVICE FROM THE NETWORK- AND THEN THERE'S A ADDITIONAL FRAMEWORK IS BEING PUT IN PLACE TO FACILITATE THE USE OF. SIMILAR AUTHENTICATION METHODS FOR THREE D. P. P. AND NON THREE GPP THAT WORKS SO LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CELLULAR AND WIFI AS THE DEVICE JUST ACROSS DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT TYPES O WIRELESS NETWORKS SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WAS GOING ON IN FIVE D. REALLY AROUND AUTHENTICATION ENCRYPTION- AND- AND HOW THE DEVICE CONNECTS TO THE NETWORK AND TRANSMITS DATA. ALL OF THESE THINGS SHOULD BE- SHOULD REALLY HELP MANAGE THE SECURITY ISSUES AROUND FIVE G. AND THEN WHEN YOU COMBINE THOSE ENHANCEMENTS WITH THE MENTIONED EARLIER WHICH THE IN THE A LOT OF IT A LOT OF THE CORE FUNCTIONALITY CLOSER TO THE EDGE. AND THEN YOU LAYER ON TOP OF THAT SOME OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE THAT WE'RE NOW SEEING. YOU KNOW REALLY FAST LIKE MACHINE OUR AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ANDCLOSELY BOTTOM THOSE ALL COMBINE ONE ANOTHER WILL CREATING SECURE AND IT WILL BE SEATED IN NETWORK I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT'S A IS GONNA BE PERFECT AND WE ALL KNOW IT'S A INTEREST WERE COST MAKING TO IMPROVE SECURITY- BUT WOULD YOU THINK THAT THE FIVE G. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING COMBINED WITH THESE OTHER TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES. WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE US GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND BETTER CAPABILITY. ULTIMATELY DEAL WITH SECURITY THREATS AS WE SEE THEM NO AS WE GO TO FIVE YOU CAN BE ALL. SO THAT HAPPENED TO QUESTIONS I YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP. WITH THE PANELISTS THE FIRST QUESTION. ARE MOST INDUSTRIES AT A PLACE WHERE THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT TO WHICH A FIVE G. NETWORKS CHANGES THEIR- RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES. OR IS THERE STILL A GREAT DEAL OF UNKNOWNS ANY ANY PALACE SO WE FEEL LIKE THE CHINA. I CAN TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT OF THE PERSPECTIVE OF MANY. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT BE TALKED TO- AND I THINK OF ME AS A LARGE COMPANIES TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL OF FIVE G. MANY SMALL COMPANIES ARE AT SIXTY EIGHT AND HOLDING BACK ON I THINK THEY ARE EAGER TO REALIZE THE BENEFITSTHAT THEY HAD A LOT. OF ARE THERE ARE CERTAIN THE ALBERTA CRIMELINE THEN THEY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN AND THEY HAVE TO AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM INCOME STUFF- UTILIZING THOSE FEATURES. ASSISTANCE ON THIS BECAUSE OUR ORIGINAL CREATING THE OPTION OR CUSTOMIZED REYES SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NOT EVEN FAMILY AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE A STRUGGLING THE GUY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEN TO ACTUALLY TAP INTO THOSE OPTIONS SO I'LL I'LL DEFER TO MY PARENTS. WHO COULD NOT BE MORE THAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ANSWER I SAW LIKE A AVERAGE FOR AND WAS BUT FOR IN HIS HEART WITH THE AND WEB SERVICE TO DO SOMETHING CALLED MOBILE EDGE COMPUTE AND MOBILE EDGE COMPUTE COMBINED WITH FIVE G. AND THE MASSIVE FIBER- BACKHAUL AND TRANSPORT IT IS NECESSARY. IT THINK OF IT AS BUILDING MANY CLOUDS CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE NETWORK SO- AMAZON HAS ALREADY. TRANSFORMED OUR LIVESBY BUILDING THE CARPET YOU KNOW HELPING BUILD A CLOUD ONE OF THE CLOUD PROVIDERS. WHERE CONTENT CAN BE STORED SO THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE STORED ON YOUR DEVICE. BUT IT HAS STATE AT ALL THAT CONTENT HAS TO GET OVER THE NETWORK SO IF YOU COULD BUILD. MANY CLOUDS CLOSER TO THE EDGE OF THE NETWORK. BACK FURTHER WITH THE EIGHT CURRENCIES A FIVE G. REALLY IT CAN DELIVER- MASSIVE TAG KRUGMAN'S FOR INDUSTRY AND I JUST SAW A COMMERCIAL. I TALK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT. A W. S. AT MOBILE EDGE COMPUTE. ARE ATTACKING PEOPLE'S LIVES RIGHT NOW I MEAN THIS IS FOR THE OTHERS THAT WOULD RESULT THERE'S THEY BECOME MISSOURI ABOUT AT COMPUTING WHICH YOU WERE WERE PARTNERING WITH MICROSOFT YOU WERE WHICH IS A COMPETITOR TO AMAZON BUT THERE KIND OF OFFERING VERY SIMILAR FROM SO MOVING THAT COMPUTE FUNCTIONALITY CLOSER TO THE EDGE WHICH WILL ALLOW ALL OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS ALL THE THREE NATIONAL CARRIERS WILL BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE A LOT OF THAT FUNCTIONALITY I THINK. I THINK- AND WANTED TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER FOR THAT BUSINESS I THINK OVERALL I KIND OF AGREE WITH- TECHNICAL FALL HERE THAT YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT WE'LL SEE IS A LOT OF ENTERPRISE FIVE G. ROLLOUT AND THEN ULTIMATELY AS THOSE APPLICATIONS REDUCE THE STRUCTURAL DOWN DOWN MARKETS OTHER. OTHER SEGMENTS YOU KNOW I THINK- YOU KNOW YOU SEE SOME OF THESE USE CASES EMERGE AND THEN USERS WILL WILL PICK UP ON THIS TEAM SAID IN A LITTLE START AFFECT OTHER. OTHER ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS BUT SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE NOT NECESSARILY JUST LIMITED ENTERPRISES RIGHTS TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MEASURE EARLIER LIKE LIKE DRONES ARE USED IN A LOT OF APPLICATIONS ARE NOT JUST ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS AS OUR- SO THESE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE. ULTIMATELY HOW THAT ROLLS OUT BUT I THINK MOST BUSINESSES ARE SURELY THE ENTERPRISE SPACE WE GET TONS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FIVE G. AS IN MY- YES I WOULD SAY THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON THERE- YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS. OUT IS THAT THESE THINGS REDUCE I THANK YOU FOR. MUCH BELIEVE I HEARD THE TERM SMART SIT BE BEING MENTIONED BY ONE OF PANELISTS THE QUESTION IS IN THE CREATION OF SMART CITY TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DEVELOPED. TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT INDIVIDUALS. HOW DOES. THE FIVE G. TECHNOLOGY ADDRESS ISSUES LIKE BIASES. ARE WHETHER IT IS RACIAL BIAS. OR AGENDA BIAS OR ANY KIND OF- BIASES. I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM OF PIZZA- I AND DONALD I DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO THAT GIVE IT TO US. I THINK THE FIGHT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING THE DETECTION PRACTICES. WELL I NINETEEN BECAUSE. IT THESE SCHOOLS THAT ARE PROVIDED AND I THINK IN BEFORE OCTOBER INTELLIGENCE MAY LEARNING I ARE GOING TO BE FEATURED HEAVILY IN TRYING TO DRIVE USE FROM THAT THAT IS BEING RIGHT WHAT WE HAVE TO BE SEVERAL OF HIS OFFICE THE NUMBER BEAGLE OR THE UNDER THE BE UNDER I RECORD AND I AND THE EXTRA I POTENTIAL THE MIGHT BE THAT NO ONE PLACE IDEA THAT THIS IS RUNNING FIVE G. IS A DOESN'T LOOK UP TO ME ALSO BY CLOSE REELING ON AUG YEAH I AND MACHINE LEARNING TO HELP OPTIMIZE THE BILL'S GOING TO THEY CAN BE BY THEMSELVES AND SOME FRIENDS YOU COULD SAY I DON'T SEE I THINK IN THESE AREAS THAT SELECT ME BUT IS MADE HAVE COME AND IS OF THE HERE TO TALK DOES THE UNDER SO COMMUNITY BY ABOUT NOT GONNA PEOPLE THE QUOTE THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE I JUST DON'T NIGHT SO TO THAT CAN COME UP YES THEREFORE I THE KIND OF BIASES THAT NEED BE PRESENT IN DATA THAT THE C. IF FOREST TRAINING THEM OUR RECORDS BUT I BUT RECOGNITION IS THE FOR PART AMERICAN ON THE HUMANS OF THIS TO. THE SITE INTO MUST BE DISMISSED AND MAKES THE DENTIST THAT LICENSE MAY LIST AND LEARN TO LOOK FOR THEM BEFORE THAT I RELEASED FROM THE TRAINING OTHER THAN SOME OF THE DATA I THINK YOU WILL BE IN A MUCH PLACE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OKAY GREAT I WOULD JUST I WOULD IS THAT THE YOU KNOW THERE I DON'T THINK IT'S A UNIQUE FIVE G. BUT I THE IDEA OF A AYE AM IN THE YOU OBVIOUSLY RAISES THE OF AND THERE'S BEEN A THERE'S BEEN ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT I'LL CALL THE ETHICAL YOU OF AI IN THIS TIMES TO CHECK SOMETHING I KNOW EIGHTEEN WE HAVE A DON'T I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR BUT THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP THE COMPANY HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS ARTIFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW AS WE THOSE OF FROM THE FISHING SEASON THE NETWORK AND I MENTIONED EARLIER YOU KNOW ONE OF THE USE CASES FOR AI AND ML IT IS SECURITY- IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT IT DOCUMENTS SECURE UNETHICAL MANNER SO. I THINK THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION HERE IN DC ABOUT EXACTLY HOW HOW TO DO THAT I KNOW IT'S AN ONGOING CONCERN A LOT OF IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO FIVE G. IT'S KIND OF A COMPASS IS ALL OF THE USE OF A. I. AND ALL WHICH REALLY IS. YOU KNOW SPANS FIVE G. BUT ALSO CLOUD NETWORKS AND APPLICATIONS ETCETERA SO- IT'S AN ONGOING DISCUSSION AND I THINK SOMETHING THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE. REALLY A KEY CONCERN. FOR ALL THE COMPANIES INVOLVED HERE GOING FORWARD THANK CHRISTMAS CHAIRMAN I ADD IT FROM FROM A DEPLOYMENT ASPECT- YOU KNOW I TALKED ABOUT- FIVE G. TECHNOLOGY BEING POISED TO. SOLVE THE LAST MILE PROBLEM IN LARGE PART. NOW YOU KNOW. ALL THERE ARE GOING TO BE POCKETS. OF OUR STATE. THAT ARE SO REMOTE AND SO CHALLENGING. THAT A HUNDRED PERCENT- BUILD OUT- IS NOT GOING TO BE- POSSIBLE BUT- IN LARGE PART. UBIQUITOUS DEPLOYMENT. IS THE GOAL. AND IS THE INTENTION OF THESE. NETWORKS UTILIZING BOTH. THE HIGH BAND AND- THE MID BAND SPECTRUM IN COMBINATION WITH. THE MASSIVE FIBER- BACK CALLS I. AND TRANSPORT I WOULD SAY THAT. THESE DEVICES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT THEY ARE AGNOSTIC TO THE USER RIGHT THE NETWORK. WHEN YOU'RE GOING AROUND JUST TO SEE IS THAT THERE IS A DEVICE REQUESTING ACCESS TO IT. AND SO WHAT ARE ENGINEERS DO IN BUILDING OUT THE RADIO ACCESS NETWORK IS THEY BUILD WHERE WIRELESS GOES WHERE THE PEOPLE GO RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO BUILD BASED ON THE DENSITY OF OF USAGE. AND I THINK THAT AS WE BUILD OUT THESE NETWORKS I WOULDUNDERSCORE THE URGENCY OF YOUR QUESTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE'RE BUILDING OUT NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF LOWER INCOME AND SOCIO ECONOMICALLY- DEPRESSED COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF RACIAL EQUITY THERE IS A COMPONENT IF YOU LOOK AT. THE DATA YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT WHERE THE LOW INCOME- PEOPLE ARE YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK FOR MY CRITICAL RACE A PERSPECTIVE. WHERE ARE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT THESE NETWORKS DO GET DEPLOYED UBIQUITOUSLY BUT THE DEVICES THEMSELVES ARE TOTALLY AGNOSTIC TO WHO THE USER IS IT'S JUST DEVICE TRYING TO CONNECT TO THE NETWORK GOT IT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE ONLY QUESTIONS OUT THAT I HAVE AT THIS POINT- SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT PANEL. OF THE TOPIC OF THAT IS BUILDING AND IMPLEMENTING FIVE G. NETWORKS- ADJOINING THE PANEL OR THREE OUR SPEAKERS SO WE START WITH US MISIA PARKER WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF NETWORK ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS WITH T. MOBILE- JEFF NEAL LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE WHICH CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. AND ROBERT TRIP MADE A THIRD MANAGING PARTNER OF TELECOM LAW FIRM PC SO WITH THAT- MISS PARKER. HOW WOULD YOU PLEASE SELECT THE START YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE NETWORK- FROM THE CARRICK'S PERSPECTIVE OBVIOUSLY I'M TO COME FROM THE KERRIER PERSPECTIVE- AS MANY OF YOU MIGHT BE WELL VERSED. ABOUT NEXT NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR WIRELESS FACILITIES IN GENERAL I JUST WANT TO TOUCH UPON- KIND OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT FIVE G. ANY UPGRADES THAT ARE NEEDED TO THE NETWORK- SO OUR WIRELESS FACILITIES CONSISTING OF BASE STATIONS ANTENNAS RADIO OUR AND BACK ALL ALONG WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT AND- THE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE ALREADY EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE. IS AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO UPGRADE- THE FACILITIES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND IN SOME CASES IN LOCATIONS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE FACILITIES WE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD NEED TO- PLACE THE NEW FACILITY BUT FOR THE MOST PART. WHEN IT COMES TO THE FIVE G. UPGRADES A MANY OF THE CARRIERS ARE LOOKING TO UPGRADE EXISTING FACILITIES- AND THAT WOULD CONSIST OF- ANTENNA ADS. RADIO ADS AND B. STATION- UPGRADES- ALONG WITH SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY GOOD THAT RUDY ADDED IN THE LAST PANEL- WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER- BACK CALL WHEN WE'RE DOING THESE UPGRADES TO FIVE G. AND RUDY I'M NOT GONNA TOUCH TOO MUCH ON THAT LAST NOW BECAUSE I THINK HE DID A VERY NICE JOB IN. COVERING THAT- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT- WHEN WE'RE DEPLOYING FIVE G. AND EVEN FORTY- BACK CALL IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER AND WE NEED TO UPGRADE ALONG. THE WAY- ONE OF THE THINGS I IS IMPORTANT TO. OUT AND TO ADD IN IT JUST TO WHAT HE HAD STATED THAT NOT ALL CARE YOUR HAVE THEIR OWN BACK CENTER IN SOME THEY ARE ADEPT ON THIRD PARTIES- TWO WEEKS STEP BACK CALL FROM. AND SO- THAT CREATES A NEED FOR US TO HAVE SOMETIMES HAVE TO DEPEND ON- PERMITTING JERSEY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS- AND WE CAN IN THE FUTURE DO SMART PLANNING DECISIONS THAT HELP HELP WITH THAT SO I'LL EXPLAIN THAT IN A SECOND BUT IS FAR FIVE GT- NETWORKS AND CARRIERS- LOOK AT DOMINATION OF THE SITE IN THERE NOW SO FOR THE MOST PART- WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED THE MATTER SITE- LARGER DEPLOYMENTS WE HAVE SMALL CELLS THAT AND SOMETIMES ARE FOUND IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY. AND THEN WE HAVE DASCOM'S THAT ARE FOUND IN OUR EVENT SPACES- WE NEED WHEN WE'RE DECIDING WHAT TO EAT- DEPLOYED IN THOSE APPLICATIONS WE LOOK AT THE COVERAGE AND CAPACITY NEEDS AND READING ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE LAST PANEL WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GOOD. THEN WHEN WE'RE DECIDING ON HOW TO DESIGN THE NETWORK OR WHAT TO DEPLOY WE'RE LOOKING AT POPULATION DENSITY AND ALSO AT THE USERS THAT MIGHT BE ON THE NETWORK WHEN WE'RE MAKING THOSE. DECISIONS- WHEN WE'RE UP THESE AT THIS THANK BE IN VARIOUS LOOKING SOME ARE OBVIOUSLY LOOK IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS COMMERCIAL AREAS AND AS I MENTIONED EVENT SPACES- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- AS FAR AS NETWORK AND FIND A FIVE JEAN DOING EXPEDITIOUSLY. AND THAT WE CAN CONSIDER GOING FOR IN FUTURE IS SMART PLANNING SO LOOKING AT WHERE WE WANT. THE TECHNOLOGY TO GO INTO THE CHURCH AND MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR PLANNING AND WORK- SUBMITTING TO JURISDICTIONS ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT. WE COULD DO YOU TO ANTICIPATE WHAT IS COMING NEXT AND THAT COULD BE- UNDER A SMART PLAY ANY MODEL WHERE YOU PARTNER WITH JURISDICTIONS TO DETERMINE. WHAT COULD BE PROVIDED IN ADVANCE OF THE TECHNOLOGY BEING ADDED TO THE SITE SO THAT IT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE TIME THAT WE TAKE TO GO THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS- ANOTHER THING THAT WAS MENTIONED ON THE PANEL THAT I THINK IT'S- IMPORTANT TO REITERATE. IS THAT- FIVE G. IS IT CANCER MOBILE BROADBAND RIGHT. SO- INTENTIONALLY ONE HAPPEN OF OVER NETWORK WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO PRETTY MUCH HAVE BOB AND AT THE DISPOSAL AS THE TRAVELED THROUGHOUT DAY WITH DEVICE THEY HAVE SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT AND UPGRADE OUR NETWORKS TO SUPPORT ALL THE ADDITIONAL USERS RP YOU. BETTER BE ABLE TO USE OUR SERVICES FOR MANY MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF LIFE HELLO THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO TOUCH UPON YOU- IN THE CONVERSATION OF THE NETWORK UPGRADES IS THAT- SPIKY SPEEDS ARE FASTER AS MENTIONED BEFORE- LATENCY ISN'T IMPROVED AND SO ASK PEOPLE TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THEIR DAY- THERE OBVIOUSLY USING YOUR DEVICES FOR MANY THINGS. AND SO OF THE NETWORK AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE NETWORK HAS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ALL THE PIECES BACK ON PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY HAVING- THAT ARE USING FOR THEIR DEVICES SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT- WE ARE SUPPORTING THE NETWORK UPGRADES WERE DOING IT QUICKLY AND WE'RE BEING ABLE TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS DEMANDS. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT I'M KIND OF HOW- THE MOBILE AND THEN OTHER CARRIERS ARE LOOKING AT WHAT FIVE G. LOOKS LIKE FOR THAT. SO AS MENTIONED I THINK ON OTHER PANELS- MANY YEARS HAVE DECIDED TO DEPLOY FIVE G. AND A LOW BAND MID BAND AND- HIGH BAND SPECTRUM AND FOR T. MOBILE AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THERE WAS A- A RECENT MERGER WITH SPRINT THAT GAVE US THE ABILITY TO HAVE ACCESS. TO TWO POINT FIVE OR MID BAND SPECTRUM. OF MID BAND SPECTRUM IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL CHARACTERS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE AND TO ADD ON INTO YOUR INTO. THE FIVE G. PLAN FOR THE FUTURE SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ALL CARRIERS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THOSE THREE LAYERS AND FOR T. MOBILE THE MERGER PROVIDED US ACCESS TO THE TWO POINT FIVE. MEGAHERTZ AS WE CONTINUE TO GO DOWN THE PATH TO FIVE G. WE ARE GOING. OBVIOUSLY NEED THE SUPPORT AT AS YOU KNOW AT THE SPECTRUM BACK WE NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DEPLOY A FIVE G. G. TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND ALL PLACES AND THAT SPECTRUM. OBVIOUSLY WE GET FROM OPTIONS BUT I WANTED TO MENTION THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A LAYER APPROACH TO FIVE G. DEPLOYMENTS AND NETWORKS AND SO IT'S A LOW BAND BIG BAND AND- HIGH BAND PLAY THERE ARE WHEN WE- ARE DEPLOYING THESE NETWORK UPGRADES- WE OFTEN TIMES HAVE TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND ALTHOUGH- THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CLARIFIED AND HAS MODIFIED A KEY ELEMENTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION OBVIOUSLY AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS WE NEED THE SUPPORT OF AS OF. LEGISLATION AT THAT LEVEL ND PULSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ORDINANCE- CHANGES AND CONSIDERATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DEPLOY A FIVE G. EXPEDITIOUSLY I'M SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE LOOK AT AS THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE DEPLOY. QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IS- WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BALANCING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AGAINST THE NEEDS OF THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DEPLOY QUICKLY- SOME AREAS IN WHICH WE'VE SEEN THAT IT'S THEIR VERY IT'S VERY POSITIVE. FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY IS MIND JURISDICTIONS CONSIDER OBVIOUSLY FROM AN AESTHETIC IMPACT THAT CERTAIN FACILITIES ARE ALREADY CONCEALED ARE ALREADY ARE BEHIND SCREENING- AND THEREFORE AND THE POINT QUICKLY THROUGH HAVING A- SHORTENED REVIEW PROCESS IS VERY HELPFUL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO. GET FIVE G. MARKETS INTO MARKET AS FAST AS WE CAN SO PARTNERING WITH JURISDICTIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO HAVE GOOD FACILITIES THAT ARE ALREADY- IN IN THE JURISDICTIONS AND THAT THE UPGRADES THAT WERE ASKING FOR ARE GOING TO JUST BE A MINOR UPGRADES AND NOT. DO NOT HAVE AN AESTHETIC IMPACT AND SHOULD BE DEPLOYED QUICKLY- I'M ALSO LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE SMART I THINK IT'S A GREAT OUR NUMBER JURISDICTIONS I THINK IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO DEPLOY FIVE G. AS FAST AS WE CAN AND THAT WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT IN ADVANCE STEP UP AS THE TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO GROW ON THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT WE PLANNED- FOR MAYBE. CALL. AND- THAT THE STREET MAYBE WITH STREETS OVER UP YOU KNOW STREETS WE DETERMINED THAT THERE MY BE AND I FOR US TO PROVIDE THE FACT HALL THERE WERE IN THE IS A SMALL CELLS ATTEND ARMS OWNED EACH WE HAVE COSTS FACT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BY GETTING BACK IN FIRST READY FOR- WHAT WILL BECOME YEAH NOW AND THOSE ARE SOWAYS TO PARTNER WITH THE LOCAL ENTITIES TO ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO W. G. TECHNOLOGIES BUT HIS AND IN SOME CASES- ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THAT THINGS CHANGE- AND WE ALL HAVE TO BE AGILE- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WORK WITH THE SOMETIMES IT'S THINGS IT'S GOOD TO PARTNER THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT NEW RULES AND POLICIES QUICKLY- SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DEPLOY AS FAST AS YOU CAN FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY AND ALSO TO GET THE FULL BENEFITS OF WHAT FIVE G. CAN OFFER TO ASK. SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN POINTS THAT I WANTED TO HIT ON ON THIS FAR AS- THE- DEPLOYMENT FOR FIVE G. THANK YOU MUCH PARKER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION LETTUCE- NEXT GO TO MR JEFF NEAL- LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THERE'S NO FOR THE SPARE CARE MEMBERS JEFF MIGLIOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. FIVE TWO MAIN POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE FIRST WE'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE MANY BENEFITS FIVE G. WILL BRING TO CALIFORNIANS AND SAY COUNTIES ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW POSSIBILITIES FIVE G. WILL BRING FOR PROVIDING GOVERNMENT SERVICES. M. BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING AS THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS HAVE THAT THESE BENEFITS CAN ONLY BE REALIZED IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FIBER AVAILABLE ALL INTERNET CONNECTIONS WHETHER WIRED OR MOBILE COME BACK TO FIGHT FOR. THE RIGHT NOW THOUGH MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE WITHOUT ANY ACCESS TO BROADBAND FOR THAT EXACT REASON A LACK OF FIBER SO WHILE DEPLOYED IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY CONNECTED IS A GOOD THING. WE SHOULD KEEP THOSE BENEFITING IN CONTEXT. I IT IS AN ISSUE JULIE YOU IN RURAL AREA AND WELL AS URBAN THAT ARE ALL ACT JUST AND HISTORICALLY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF DISCRIMINATION. SB ONE FIFTY SIX THOUGH WHICH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED EARLIER THIS SUMMER WILL GO A LONG WAY EQUALIZING ACCESS BY BOTH- PROVIDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SUBSIDIES. FOR HIGH SPEED LAST MILE FIBRE INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT ALSO CRITICALLY BY BUILDING A STATE OWNED MIDDLE MILE FIBER NETWORK I THAT WILL BE OPEN TO ALL PROVIDERS ON NON DISCRIMINATORY TERMS. AND WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COST AND THE TIME FOR THEM TO BUILD OUT THEIR NETWORKS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS I THE OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO. IS THE QUESTION OF HOW TO BALANCE THE DESIRE FOR QUICK EXPANSION OF FIVE G. INFRASTRUCTURE WITH WITH BOTH THE LAND USE AUTHORITY IN PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS OF THE COUNTIES AND CITIES THAT ARE CHARGED WITH THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES- AND ALSO WITH OUR GENUINE DESIRE FOR COMMUNITIES. AT ALL OF THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED SERVICE BY CONNECTING FIVE G. WITH THE POLICY LOOKING BACKWARD AS FAR AND THE PROVIDE BUILDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE HIM IS SIMPLE PROMISE THAT THAT ADAM THESE EFFORTS AND VISIBLY THAT PERMIT STREAMLINING AND REDUCE REGULATIONS WILL LEAD NOT ONLY TO FASTER DEPLOYMENT BUT TO MORE WIDESPREAD DEPLOYMENT. AND SPECIFICALLY ROOT CANAL PER AREA THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED YOU HEARD IT TODAY AT THAT FIVE G. WILL SOLVE THE LAST MILE PART OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO DO THAT THE DENSITY OF SMALL CELLS NECESSARY FOR FIVE G. TO WORK IS MUCH GREATER THE ARGUMENTS FOR UNFETTERED ACCESS TO UTILITY POLES AND TRAFFIC LIGHT POLES PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL AGENCIES. BUT INCREASE DENSITY DOESN'T EXACTLY LEND ITSELF TO DEPLOYMENT IN AREAS WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT DENSELY SO WHAT WILL FIVE G. BE THE ANSWER TO YOUR BIG WHAT IS BROADBAND IN RURAL AREAS OR AND OR OR SUBURBAN AREAS THAT ARE NOT DENSELY POPULATED M. AS THE PREVIOUS BALANCE THAT THE FCC HAS PROMULGATED REGULATIONS ONCE THE STATE IS AS EXPAND OURS CONSIDERING FURTHER EXPANSION OF. THE INCIDENT REDUCE MARKET BARRIERS AND INCENTIVIZE THE DEPLOYMENT OF A WIRELESS AND CABLE COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES THE FCC RULES PROVIDE FOR STRINGENT TIME LIMITS ARE SHOT CLOCKS THE CITING OF WIRELESS FACILITIES BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND IT REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ALLOW NON DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY- A TO AN UNPRECEDENTED DEGREE I'M SO I THINK THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO KEEP IN MIND GOING FORWARD IS WHETHER THE DEREGULATION THAT HAS BEEN GRANTED IN FACT RESULTS IN IMPROVED CONNECTIONS FOR THE- GROW AREAS FOR ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED WORK ON THE CONTRARY IF. WHETHER DEPLOYMENT IS LARGELY CENTERED IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY WELL CONNECTED WITH ANY OTHER AREAS EVEN FARTHER BEHIND BECAUSE- FRANKLY WHEN CARD IS EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS IN THE PAST WE HEARD OF FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE PASSAGE OF OBJECT THAT THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE A COMPETITION ACT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. AND THE RESULTS DID NOT EXACTLY LIVE UP TO THE PROMISES AND UBIQUITOUS ACCESS CHEAPER SERVICE AND MORE COMPETITION. IN SO IF FIVE G. DEPLOYMENT FOLLOWS THE SAME PATTERN WE'VE SEEN BEFORE AFTER THE PREVIOUS ROUNDS OF IMPROVED MOBILE COVERAGE AND FIBRE BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT THAT WILL WHAT POLICY MAKERS HAVE LOST THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO USE PERMIT STREAMLINING AS AN INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE WORK REQUIRE. EQUITABLE DEPLOYMENT BECAUSE ONCE THE FACILITIES ARE REPORTED IN THE MOST LUCRATIVE AREAS THAT LEVERAGE WILL BE GONE SO TO SUMMARIZE FIRST THAT THE BENEFITS OF FIVE G. ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE FIBER AND THE NEWLY APPROVED A STATE OWNED OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF FIBRE DECREASE THE COST OF EXPANDING. LAST MILE NETWORKS FOR ALL PROVIDERS SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE POLICIES IMPLEMENTED WITH THE PASSAGE SB ONE FIFTY SIX. SECOND THE DEREGULATION PERMIT STREAMLINING ALREADY AND ALL ALLOW PROVIDERS UNPRECEDENTED INEXPENSIVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO MONITOR- IMPORTANT WHETHER THIS DEREGULATION IN FACT LEADS TO A MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO BROADBAND WITH IT NEARLY LOWERS. THE COST TO DEPLOY THE IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY IN AREAS THAT ARE WELCOME. WE CERTAINLY HAVE HIGH HOPES THAT THIS NEW GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY WILL RESULT IN A MORE CONNECTING CALIFORNIA. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO BOTH PROVIDE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD AND TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I HEALTH A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL. IF I MAY OUR. OKAY SORRY. BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS SO LET'S GO TO AUTHORED PANELISTS TO MR ROBERT TRIP ME THE THIRD. THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIR CHAU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I HAVE THE UNENVIABLE POSITION OF STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR LUNCH BUT I ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF BATTING CLEANUP SO. I LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT THESE TEAM MEMBERS OF THE PANEL THAT CAME BEFORE ME SO. FIVE G. HAS A LOT OF PROMISE AND THERE ARE LOTS OF ELEGANT SOLUTIONS TO DIFFICULT PROBLEMS THAT PLAGUE. OUR NETWORK CONNECTIVITY OR NETWORK SECURITY AND OUR SOCIAL ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES THAT HAVE BECOME ESSENTIALLY A UTILITY WHAT I'M HERE TO DO TODAY IS TALK ABOUT SOME PRACTICAL IMPACTS- THAT ARE EXPECTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AT THE DEPLOYMENT STAGE SO. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HEARD- AT THE FIRST PANEL AND I THINK IT WAS DR GUPTA WHO SAID. THAT ADOPTION IS LUMPY WELL DEPLOYMENT IS LUCKY TO. AND IT'S PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF LIMITED REGULATORY WHIPLASH SO WE'VE HAD A DECADES OLD REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT AND WE'VE HAD RECENTLY AS OF TWENTY NINETEEN A LOT OF CHANGES COMING FROM THE FCC ABOUT HOW FAST WERE SUPPOSED TO ADOPT CERTAIN REGULATIONS. HOW QUICKLY WERE SUPPOSED TO APPROVE CERTAIN PERMITS AND HOW MUCH MONEY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN CHARGE FOR THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS. AND THAT CREATES SOME PROBLEMS NUMBER ONE. IS A RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROBLEM. WIRELESS IT IS IMPORTANT ROBIN AND IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT THEREARE LOTS OF OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FACE AND MANY PLANNING OR EVEN PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE HAVE ONLY MAYBE ONE. MEMBER OF THEIR STAFF. AND ONE HUNDRED NETWORKING UP ON TOP OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OTHER TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT OUR LEGISLATIVE AGENDA SO IF WE WANT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY- THEY NEED TO BE PROPERLY STAFFED. AND THAT ALSO REQUIRES TIME BECAUSE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE HANDS AVAILABLE TO MOVE THESE APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE PROCESS WE'VE GOT TO BE READY WITH THOSE HANDS. FIND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NECESSARY TO A CABLE ACCEPTING THESE APPLICATIONS REVIEWING THAT PROCESSING THEM MAKING A RECOMMENDATION ABOUT APPROVAL IT IT ALSO REQUIRES TIME ON THE FRONT SO THERE'S A BIT OF A WIND UP WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGING HOW WE PROCESS THESE APPLICATIONS WE WENT FROM ZONING HEAVY TYPE OF REVIEW PROCESS BEFORE TWENTY NINETY. TO A MORE ADMINISTRATIVE LESS HEARING HEAVY TYPE PROCESS AFTER TWENTY G. AND IN MANY CASES THE TIME IT TAKES TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION UNDER WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALLED SHOT CLOCK CAN BE LONGER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES I'M SORRY SHORTER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES. TO ADOPT NEW REGULATIONS AND ALLOW CITIES TO PROCESS THESE APPLICATIONS ON ADMINISTRATIVE BASIS SO GIVING US TIME AND RESOURCES WOULD HELP IN ADAPTING TO THE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND REGULATION THAT WE'RE SEEING. FROM THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL AND FROM PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY INPUT TO THAT PROCESS AND I HEARD FOR EXAMPLE MISS PARKER FROM T. MOBILE TALK ABOUT THE SMART PROCESS AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT. A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE ADOPTED. PROCESS SEES WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR AUTHORITY BECAUSE MUCH OF THEIR THIRTIES BEEN TAKEN AWAY BUT WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR AUTHORITY. TO CREATE WHAT THEY CALL PRE APPROVALS. RIGHT IF THE CARRIER WANTS TO COME IN AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT A DESIGN THAT IS REPLICABLE. THROUGH COMMUNITY I AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT TAKES AWAY A LOT OF THE THOUGHT PROCESS THAT GOES INTO THE NORMAL REVIEW. THAT WE WANT TO. WORK WITH THEM SHOULD A STABBER STYLE AND THEN MOVE THAT FORWARD AS A PRE APPROVAL THAT COULD BE REPLICATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN REALLY STREAMLINING THAT PROCESS BUT THAT. STILL TAKES TIME THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION WAS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT REALLY ELEGANT SOLUTIONS ABOUT. AVOIDING THE EXPENSE AND TIME THAT IT TAKES TO DEPLOY FIBER. IN AREAS THAT ARE HARD TO REACH. AND THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM- THESE ARE PRIVATE ENTITIES. THE ANSWER TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND SO IT'S NOT. GOING TO GIVE THEM A RETURN ON INVESTMENT TO SEND FIBER OR INVESTMENT DOLLARS OUT TO RURAL AREA THEY JUST WON'T DO IT AND WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN I THINK. MISTER NEAL MADE THAT POINT PRETTY WELL. UP THERE ARE. WIRELESS BACKHAUL OPTIONS THAT I THINK MAKES SENSE. WHAT'S POWER WAS STILL AN ISSUE. AND IN URBAN AREAS WHERE THERE AREDIGITAL DIVIDES. THERE ARE STILL FIBER OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE CARRIERS TO CUT UP THE STREETS. AND CUTTING UP THE STREETS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INSTEAD IS A LOT OF HARPER- NOT JUST BECAUSE- OF SOMETHING YOU READ IN YOUR PACKET ABOUT THE MORATORIUM WATER SAYING THAT WE CANNOT. PROHIBIT THE DEPLOYMENT OF THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES THERE ARE SOME AGAIN ELEGANT SOLUTIONS LIKE MICROSTRATEGY INC THAT REDUCE THE IMPACT ON THE STREETS. BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT A HALF DOZEN OR A DOZEN ENTITIES AT ALL ONE MICRO TRENCHING THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE STREET. THE FACT THEY'RE DOIN TWELVE INCH CUTS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU COULD BE DOING ONE LARGE STRETCH IT WE CAN'T FORCE THEM INTO THAT SITUATION. SOWE ARE DEALING WITH- THE EXTERNALITIES OF PHYSICAL ONE. AND IT DOESN'T JUST AND THAT WELL HOW MANY DIFFERENT CUTS READ HAPPENED STREET ENDS ALSO WITH. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STREET IF THERE ARE IMPROPER. CONSTRUCTION METHODS SO I'M REPRESENT A LOT OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA I'M NOT HERE SPEAKING FOR ANY ONE OF THEM BUT I CAN TELL YOU. THAT THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF LAWSUITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW HOW DO YOU FIND TO CLOSE. GOING OVER THE HANDLEBARS BECAUSE THEY RAN INTO A TRENCH THAT FAIL AND FOR A CITY THAT DEALS WITH THAT KIND OF ISSUE IT CAUSES THEM TO POSIT THE DEPLOYMENT STAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT INSURANCE AND THEN WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT INDEMNITY FOR ISSUES ABOUT CONSTRUCTION THAT WE CAN'T SAY YES OR NO WHERE WE ARE I'M SORRY WE CAN'T SAY NO TO WE HAVE TO SAY YES TO THESE TYPES OF DEPLOYMENTS IN MANY INSTANCES. AND THEN WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE EXTERNALITIES LATER THESE ARE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENTS THAT WERE POTENTIALLY FACING HERE SO. I THINK STREAMLINING LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCESS SEES IS CERTAINLY PART OF THE EQUATION. BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AND USED THE SITE. TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT MAKES SENSE THAT THAT DOES REQUIRE TIME AND RESOURCES. WE ALSO HAVE TO REDUCE THOSE EXTERNALITIES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MIGHT HAVE TO OTHERWISE ASSUME OR AT LEAST FACE. THE POSSIBILITY OF LIABILITY FOR WHEN IT COMES TO CUTTING UP THE STREETS FOR ALL THE POWER AND FIBER THAT'S REQUIRED TO. GET HOW LIGHT UP THESE FACILITIES UP BEYOND THAT I THINK THAT THE REST OF THE PANEL IS THAT A VERY GOOD JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING WHAT THESE THINGS ARE GOOD FOR. ALL RIGHT I'LL JUST MOMENTS BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GENERALLY IN FAVOR OF THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION THEY SEE THE BENEFITS THAT COULD COME TO THEM DOWN THE PIPELINE WHAT WE HAVE A HARD TIME WITH IS UNDERSTANDING HOW WE CAN PARTICIPATE WITH SO MANY OF US ARE ARE- LEVERAGE WITH THE LOWER EAST OR PROPERTY RIGHTS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM US MOSTLY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THESE DAYS. BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS ON THE INDUSTRY SIDE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THE GOALS HAVE BEEN TALKED HERE TODAY AND SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE AT THAT LEVEL WE CERTAINLY OPEN TO. I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DO HAVE A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS IF I MAY. OF FIRST OF ALL THIS IS THE SOMEWHAT OF A TWO PART QUESTION. ARE IS THERE SOMETHING AS- AS A SATURATION POINT WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. NETWORK AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS POLICY IN FIVE G. RELATED ISSUES OKAY WE OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE NEXT GENERATION WILL REQUIRE. MORE CELLS IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER WHETHER IT'S URBAN OR RULE OR OTHERWISE. I THINK I CAN TAKE A SHOT AT THAT SURE- I THINK THE- AS FAR AS IS THERE A SATURATION POINT- I DON'T KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW THAT THERE IS RIGHT. ESPECIALLY FIVE G. BEING DEPLOYED AS A NEWER TECHNOLOGY- WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THERE'S A SATURATION POINT THERE HOWEVER I DO YOU- WANT TO KIND OF POINT OUT SOME THINGS THAT ACTUALLY- ARE USEFUL WITH THE FIVE G. TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE CAPABILITY WITH FOUR G. M. WE'RE ABLE TO. SLICE OF SPECTRUM AND BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK A FURTHER AND LONGER IN THE WRK WITH- FOR JEEP WHICH END UP HELPING US IN HOW AND WHERE WE DEPLOY FIVE G. AND- WHICH SITES WE DECIDED TO UPGRADE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY SO I THINK IT ACTUALLY IS MORE HELPFUL THE WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO- PIECE OF. THE SPECTRUM THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AVAILABLE FOR USE AND MAKE IT ACTUALLY WORK FURTHER FOR US ADDITIONALLY I THINK OF WHEN I WAS HAVING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT LOW BAND MID BAND AND HIGH BAND I WANTED TO EXPLAIN THAT LOW BAND- THAT TECHNOLOGY- HELPED US A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH INDOOR AND INTEGRATION. MID BAND- IS HELPING US WITH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR PENETRATION BUT IT'S FOR. A LONGER DISTANCE AND THEM HI B. AND IS VERY SHORT DISTANCES OF THE LINE OF SIGHT TO THE NEXT SITE HAS TO BE PRETTY CLEAR WITH NO OBSTRUCTION THERE SO- PART OF THAT LAYERED APPROACH THAT I. TALKED ABOUT THAT MOST CARRIERS ARE ARE SEARCHING FOR AS A STRATEGY IS TO HELP TO KIND OF BRIDGE THE GAPS BETWEEN THOSE THREE OBJECTIVES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND SO THERE BY. IT WILL IT. MAY NOT RESULT IN HAVING HAVE A SAY EVERY I THINK A LOT OF THE IS THAT WE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A SITE AND OTHER RIGHT AND BY AGAIN THAT TECHNOLOGY GIVES US THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS- WHERE IS INTO IT AND IT'S NOT THE SAME EVERYWHERE RIGHT BASED ON WHAT WE ALREADY HAPPENED OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION GREAT THANK YOU OTHER PANELS SO IF WE'RE CHINA FOR LIKE. WELL I'LL JUST I'LL JUST ADD THAT PERHAPS SOMEBODY WITH THE HONORIFIC DR IN FRONT OF THE NEXT PROBABLY IF YOU'RE BETTER THAN I CAN THERE'S A LIMITED CAPACITY OF SPECTRUM- THAT IT IS ABLE TO TRANSPORT DATA. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS MISS PARKER WAS TRYING TO HARP ON IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE SOFTWARE- BEHIND THE PHYSICAL HARDWARE THAT CREATES EXCESS CAPACITY DOESN'T NECESSARILY PART OF THE SAME KINDS. OF SOLUTION AND SO FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO USE YOU MISS PARKER IS THE EXACT T. MOBILE USES. STRAND MOUNTED ANTENNAS TO OFF LOAD CAPACITY ON TWO OF A FROM THEIR NETWORKS FOR SMALL CELLS INSTEAD OF MASSIVE DEPLOYMENTS OF. THINGS ON PAUSE YOU STILL DO THINGS ON POLLS TOO BUT I IT'S THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TOOLS IN THE BOX AND SO IN TERMS OF THE SATURATION POINT IT MAY NOT BE A POLE IN FRONT OF EVERY TIME WAY- BUT IT CERTAINLY- IS DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF THE INDUSTRY TO. DETERMINE NEW SOLUTIONS FOR GETTING HIGH CAPACITY THROUGH THEIR PIPES I THINK FIBER IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ANSWERS TO THAT BECAUSE THE MATTER WHERE YOU GO. THAT DATA HAS TO FLOW BACK TO THE REST OF THE NETWORK AT SOME POINT AND SO FIVE OR TO THE POINT. OF CONNECTION. IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE RESOLUTION GREAT THANK YOU. I THINK I HEARD THE TERM FOUR GB MENTION A COUPLE TIMES- BY VARIOUS PANEL AS THE QUESTION IS ARE THERE ANY ASPECTS OF THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF FIVE G. NETWORKS THAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF MOBILE NETWORKS WILL CERTAINLY- RENDER OBSOLETE RENDER THIS ONE OBSOLETE. ANY TAKERS BUT I QUESTION. I MEAN I I'M GONNA TAKE A STAB AT IT I DON'T KNOW WEEK SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SIX GENERATION NEXT LOOKS LIKE YET I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE RENDERED OBSOLETE IN THE FUTURE HOWEVER WHAT I CAN SAY WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE. IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PLAYERS IN OUR- INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS INCLUDING- YOU YES WHICH WAS THIRD GENERATION. INSTEAD OF YOUR YOUR STOCK YES SO IT'S FAR THAT'S GETTING TO THE OBSOLETE POINT I DO THINK IT TAKES TIME AS AS THE TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES TO DETERMINE WHEN WE WILL GET TO THAT. POINT I DON'T KNOW THAT FOUR G. WILL WOULD BE OBSOLETE ANYTIME IN THE IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THAT. AS CUSTOMERS THAT WE HAVE IN ALL OF THE DEVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMERS AND WHEN WE'RE PLANNING OUR NETWORK WE DO CONSIDER THAT IN. OF WHAT TECHNOLOGY NEEDS TO BE ON EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE SO IF YOU HAVE A FOUR G. DEVICE CAPABLE DEVICE AND YOU'RE NOT YET MOVED ONTO THE FIVE G. CAPABLE DEVICE WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO STILL SERVE THE CUSTOMER. THAT WE HAVE- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT- AS WE KEEP MOVING TECHNOLOGY FORWARD- AND WE GET A CHANCE TECHNOLOGY THERE WILL BE. SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PAST WILL BE RENDERED USELESS BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET LEAD TO THAT POINT AND I WORK FOR MORE THAN EIGHTY IT SB THAT T. MOBILE WORKED FOR. EIGHTEEN T. IN THE PAST SO I'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT NETWORKS AND KIND OF HOW THE- THE INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS AND I THINK. WE'RE NOT AT THAT POINT YET BUT HE COULD BE THERE IN. IN THE FUTURE SHOULD BE SOME OTHER TECH THAT IT BOB THAT HOUSES CAN GET RID YEAH ANOTHER AND OTHER WE CURRENTLY HAVE THANK I'LL JUST ADD THE CLIENT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME WHEN SATELLITES ARE GONNA REPLACE TERRESTRIAL SYSTEMS FOR LIKE THE LAST FIVE SIX SEVEN. AND THE ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE ANYTIME SOON MOSTLY BECAUSE AS MISS PARKER SAID. PEOPLE ARE STILL USED AND DEVICES ARE STILL USE OLDER TECHNOLOGIES AND SO LONG AS THOSE ARE PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM MANY ECONOMY THEY'LL STILL BE SUPPORTED WHICH REQUIRES SUCH RATIONAL SYSTEM. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ANY TIME SOON WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOSS OF PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN. EITHER IN OR OUTSIDE RIGHT THANK YOU EARLIER HURT WE HURT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT- A WE HAVE WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. OF THE MEAT POSED THIS QUESTION I'M WONDERING WHETHER. COUNTIES AND FAX CITIES FOR THAT MATTER. AW HOW CURRENTLY HAVE THE LATITUDE TO STUDY THE SAFETY AND HEALTH ISSUES. ALL WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF CELL TECHNOLOGY I THINK- PROBABLY. A QUESTION SHE GO TO MISTER NEAL AND WARM- STRIP MAYES FOR ANYONE OF THE PANELISTS IN FACT I'M HAPPY TO. TAKE A START AT EIGHT AM I DON'T KNOW THAT THE ROLE OF COUNTY'S NECESSARILY IS TO EXAMINE SPECIFICALLY THE HEALTH EFFECTS ON ON INDIVIDUALS I THINK. A LOT OF THE TAXES THAT WE TALK ABOUT THAT WE WORRY ABOUT WITH DEPLOYMENT pOF WAY ARE THE PUBLIC SAFETY ASPECTS OF- YOU KNOW TRAFFIC CONTROL PLANS- YOU KNOW BAN- WHEN WERE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT ARE OF A POLL IS EVIL PHYSICALLY ABLE TO TAKE THE WEIGHT OF A SMALL SALARY YOU KNOW IN THE NUMBER OF ATTACHMENTS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY- YOU KNOW COMPANIES WILL WANT TO DEPLOY IN PARTICULAR AREAS THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY HOLES WHAT ONE COMPANY MIGHT NOT HAVE TO DEPLOY ON EVERY OTHER POLL. AND IF YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CARRIERS ALL ONE TO PROVIDE AT YOU KNOW MISTER IN THE SAME AREA AT SOME YOU NEED MORE LANES AS MR REYES WAS SAYING EARLIER AND SO SOME OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S ROBERT WAS SAYING SOME OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY ASPECTS LIKE THAT. BICYCLISTS RUNNING INTO TO TRENCHES YOU KNOW IT WHAT'S OUR ABILITY TO. REGULATE THE DEPLOYMENT AND THAT WAY THANK ARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT. WE YEAH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I ON THE CITY SIDE OF THE DAY TODAY CONCERNED IS. OR IS IT A POINT SIX. IS A CONSTRUCTION SAVE IS THE ACTIVITY GOING TO DISRUPT THE OTHER USES OF THE RIGHT OF WAY THAT KIND OF THING- BUT YOUR QUESTION WAS MORE GENERALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF RADIOFREQUENCY EMISSIONS. AND SO NDER THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT THE LAST TWENTY SOME ODD YEARS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER TO APPROVE OR DENY AN APPLICATION FOR AN ANTENNA A LITTLE LESS THE ANTENNA IS DEMONSTRATED SHOULD NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS SET BY THE FCC SO THIS DOESN'T MEAN NECESSARILY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN'T CONSIDER THIS ISSUE BUT IT'S A SEPARATE ONE FROM THE PHYSICAL DEPLOYMENT OF PARTICULAR SITE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE ONLY GIVEN MAYBE SIXTY DAYS TO RUBIO APPLICATION WE DON'T NEED OR NECESSARILY HAVE THE TIME. TO GO THROUGH A FULL REVIEW OF ALL THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE WE ARE LEGALLY RESTRICTED TO JUST WHETHER THE APPLICATION WOULD COMPLY WITH THE FTC'S LIMITS ARE NOT. CITIES CAN AND DO TAKE ISSUE WITH THIS AND ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE RECENT CASE OF THE DC CIRCUIT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TRUST USES FCC WHERE THE PETITIONERS WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE DC CIRCUIT STRUCK DOWN THE FCC'S CLOSING OF A NOTICE OF INQUIRY INTO CHANGES TO THE TO THE ERROR FEDERAL LIMITS SO IT IS NOT A CLOSE QUESTION BY ANY MEANS BUT ON INDIVIDUAL SIDE BY SIDE SPACES IT IS A MUCH NARROWER IN KOREA JUST COMPLIANCE. WITH THE SEC'S. STANDARDS THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS THERE ANY POTENTIAL FOR INVESTMENTS IN STREAMLINING EDUCATION TOWARDS JOBS. THAT INVOLVE THE DEPLOYMENT MAINTENANCE AND USING A FIVE G. TECHNOLOGIES. WELL I'LL I'LL TAKE THIS ONE JUST TO START OFF BUT BECAUSE I THINK I MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT IT EARLIER- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE FCC'S MOST RECENT RULEMAKINGS ON SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES. WELL AS THE OBLITERATION OF THE DISTINCTION OF MUNICIPAL PROPERTY RIGHTS VERSUS THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY. AND THAT DISTINCTION WAS ONE OF THE BASIS ON WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY AT LOCAL- SO FOR EXAMPLE A. J. EXPEDITED- LEASING PROCESS USE OR REDUCE LEASING FEES AND EXCHANGE FOR IN KIND CONSIDERATION BY FOR EXAMPLE. GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES DEVICE IS A SMALL BUSINESSES NATURE. BECAUSE ALL OF AT PROPRIETARY AUTHORITY HAS BEEN GRANTED WE'VE SEEN A KIND OF. BOTTOM FALL OUT OF THOSE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS BEING HI THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF TRYING TO PARTNER WITH THE INDUSTRY BUT THEY'RE JUST BECOMING SMALLER AND SMALLER FROM THE PERSPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS SO WE'D CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN HEARING CLEAN INDUSTRY ABOUT WHERE THEY THINK THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE. I GUESS THAT WAS BROUGHT BACK MY WAY I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER AND I THINK THAT- I ONLY CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF T. MOBILE BUT I DO THINK THAT INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER OR NOT A JURISDICTION SPECIFICALLY IT'S ASKING FOR US TO PARTNER THERE ARE WAYS AND PROGRAMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED THAT ALLOW FOR THAT TO HAPPEN ANYWAY- FOR INSTANCE- T. MOBILE HAS A PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT CAN BILLION RIGHT WHERE IT DOES- PARTNER WITH A LOCAL. MUNICIPALITIES AND ALSO SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO AT YOU KNOW AT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES SO I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN CREATIVE WAYS THAT ARE STILL THAT STILL EXIST RIGHT THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED AND I THINK THE KEY- I. CALL YOU TRIPS SO I'M GONNA CLEAN THE KEY IS TO HAVE THOSE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY- INCLUDED IN SOME OF THE CONCERNS ALONG THE WAY- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ON IN SOME OF MY COMMENTS I THINK THAT THAT. IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO. GET TO A POINT WHERE ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT MIGHT BE WITHIN THE COMPANY ARE- EXPLAINED AND PRODUCED AND SO THAT WE CAN COME TO PARTNERSHIPS ANYWAY BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT SOME COMPANIES ARE DOING THAT INDEPENDENTLY ANYWAY FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE THEY MAY NOT JUST BE- SOMETHING THAT WE MAY BRING TO THE TABLE AND USUALLY WHEN BURGEONING APPLICATIONS ARE ASKING TO BE PLACED ON A- YOU KNOW WOOSTER STREET WRITER POLL BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY THERE AND I KNOW FOR T. MOBILE WE HAVE SEPARATE PROGRAMS- I RECENTLY WENT. OUT ABBACY INDIGO WE HAD- A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT DEALT WITH THE MILITARY WHICH WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS OF INTEREST TO. THE CITIES HERE AND SO THEY WOULD ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND IT WOULD OPEN UP THE DIALOGUE SO THAT WE CAN SAY OF. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE AVAILABLE THAT COULD BE DISCUSSED A NUMBER ON THE TABLE- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PARTNERING. BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT MAY NEVER MISS A MINUTE VALUE SERVER ALSO THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OUR CUSTOMERS RIGHT SO WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT. IT'S A VALUE TO IT. SO I THINK ALL CARRIERS WOULD SAY THE SAME THING. THAT THEY HAVE THOSE- SHIFTING PROGRAMS IN THE FOR USE MISTER CHAIRMAN IS RUDY RANSOM VERIZON IF IT IF IT PLEASES YOU ARE LOVE TO HEAR MR MADE QUITE HOWEVER SO A YES I DID YES- I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU STILL WITH US THANK YOU GO AHEAD PLEASE SURE YEAH NOT BEEN WITH A GREAT- INTO TO THE SO BUT RYZEN IN THE INDUSTRY STAND READY TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GETTING THIS NETWORK BUILT- IT DOESN'T JUST REQUIRE A CHANGE OF LAWS AND LOCAL REFORM IT REQUIRES A PARTNERSHIP BUT I CALL SMALL P. PARTNERSHIP. WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE WORK THAT THE FCC AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MANY CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE DONE TO- STREAMLINED THEIR RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE NOT DONE AT THE EXPENSE OF PARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY I THINK AT AND I'LL I'LLTELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE RISE IS VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR PARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY WHAT WE SEE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE MANY GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING MY HOMETOWN OF SAN FRANCISCO WHICH SAY WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE HOLDING A GUN TO THE HEAD OF INDUSTRY STANK OR. WE WON'T COMPLY WITH THE LAW THAT'S NOT PARTNERSHIP THAT'S COOL SO WHAT WE NEED IS COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW AND THE PARTNERSHIP TO GET THIS NETWORK BELT AND WE ABSOLUTELY WE PARTNERED WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO THE CITY OF SAN JOSE THE CITY OF LONG BEACH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO CITIES ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND WE ABSOLUTELY ARE READY TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT WE NEED THE OTHER SIDE TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH AND AGREED. TO FOLLOW THE LAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M AFRAID THAT THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HOUSE. OF FOR THE PRESENTATION SO BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THIS TIME I WANT TO THANK LL THE PANELISTS. FOR JOINING US AND ALSO FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERTISE WITH US AND- WE ARE VERY MUCH IN FORM AFTER THE HEARING SO I WANT TO THANK YOU. ARE NOW LET'S TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND- FOR THOSE PANELS WHO LIKE TO STAY ON FEEL FREE TO DO SO. AND I. BELIEVE WE HAVE ALL FUND NOBODY HERE IN THE AUDIENCE- IN PERSON- TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS SO LET ME GO TO THE PHONE LINES. IN ASK THE CALL IS TO- MAKE THEIR COMMENTS AND REMARKS- AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT YOU LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO ALL ONE MINUTE- APPROXIMATELY IF POSSIBLE SO WITH THAT. LET ME GO TO THE PHONE LINES. THANK YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO STAY PUBLIC COMMENT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE AND THEN ZERO FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE WILL GO TO LIE IN TWENTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. ONE TWENTY ONE IS THAT ME AND MY IN COMMITTEE. I YES YOU ARE PLEASE GO AHEAD. EXCELLENT YOUR YOUR PHONE. SYSTEM SOMETIMES HAS SOME DIFFICULTY AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT SINCE YOU HAD SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THE VOLUME YES MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT THAT WE LOST PART OF THE AUDIO BEGINNING SO I APOLOGIZE AND- AND I'LL REPEAT SOME OF THE COMMENTS ARE. FUNNY THIS IS A THIS IS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND YET WE ARE DEFINITELY EVEN LIVING EXAMPLES RIGHT NOW OF THE LIMITATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY. SO THAT BEING SAID I WANTED TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT I THINK IT IS QUITE TELLING AND FRANKLY REALLY SUSPECT THAT MANY OF THE WITNESSES AND SUPPOSEDLY EXPERTS TODAY- REPRESENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND THEIR INTERESTS ADDITION YOU WHAT LEADERS ARE ALREADY CALIFORNIANS WITH EDT THE CPUC THEWATER SHORTAGES AND BACK AND BASICALLY JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU TOUCH AND NOW YOU CERTAINLY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SOMEHOW SUCCESSFULLY GET INTO THE BUSINESS. OF DISPENSING FIVE G. FOR CALIFORNIANS AND IN THIS HEARING WE LISTEN TO YOUR SUPPOSED EXPERTS FOR OUR- WHILE YOU'VE BEEN WHAT THE PUBLIC FOR ONE MINUTE YOU KNOW WHERE PEOPLE GOING GOVERNMENT WE DESERVE TO HAVE OUR VOICES HEARD FRANKLY SIXTY SECONDS FOR A TOPIC OF THIS MAGNITUDE IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE YOU SHOULD HAVE AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS SPEAKING IN THE HEARING NOT SIMPLY COMMUNICATION EXPERT A. K. A. YOUR SPECIAL INTERESTS I FIND THIS SHAMEFUL AND NOT BEING SAID I WILL ALSO READ FROM A SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN ARTICLE OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN CITING THIS LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE PUBLISHED PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH ON THE BIOLOGIC AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF NON IONIZING ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS EMF. SIGNED THE INTERNATIONAL EMF FINANCES THE PEEL WHICH CALLS FOR STRONGER EXPOSURE LIMIT HE'LL MAKE THE FOLLOWING NUMEROUS RECENT SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT YOU'RE NOT AFFECTS LIVING ORGANISMS OUT LEVELS WELL BELOW MOST INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL GUIDELINES THE FACTS INCLUDE INCREASED CANCER RISK CELLULAR STRESS INCREASE IN HARMFUL FREE RADICALS. GENETIC DAMAGES STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM LEARNING AND MEMORY DEFICITS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON GENERAL IN. THE WELL BEING OF HUMANS DAMAGE GOES BEYOND THE HUMAN RACE AND THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE OF HARMFUL EFFECTS ON BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE SINCE FIVE G. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THERE IS A NARROW RESEARCH ON HEALTH EFFECTS SO WE'RE FLYING BLIND QUOTE A U. S. SENATOR. AND I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT YOU'VE ALREADY GIVEN ME MORE TIME I SUSPECT THERE'S MORE PEOPLE IN Q. WHO WANTTO SPEAK. AND PLEASE NEXT TIME WITH YOUR HEARING LITTLE BETTER FOR THE OF THE P. BECAUSE AFTER ALL IT IS A WE THE P. NOT ARE THE GOVERNOR THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL THE NEXT CALLER PLEASE THANK YOU AND WE WILL GO TO LINE AT SEVENTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YEAH MY NAME CAPTURE MUCH BROADCASTER COUNTY RESIDENT YOU DISCUSS THE OPPORTUNITY. OF YOUR FIVE G. BUT LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT THE CHALLENGES. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BY G. ADAM HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS THEIR TECHNOLOGY BEING ROLLED OUT WITHOUT PRE TESTING PER SHORT OR LONG TERM HEALTH EFFECTS. IS OBVIOUS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN THE PALACE WHERE THE DOCTOR SPEAKING OUT ISN'T HEALTH CONCERN BUT HE'S PROVEN HEALTH HAZARD BECAUSE FORTY THREE G. TWO G. FREQUENCIES UP ALL SHOWN ARE FOR HARMFUL BIOLOGICAL ATTACK. IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THE LARGEST ROUTE THAT HE EVER FUNDED IN THE USA AND P. P. THIRTY CONCLUDED THAT TWO G. EXPOSURE ALONE IS ENOUGH TO CAUSE BRAIN HEART LIVER CANCERS AND OTHER TUMORS. ANOTHER TIME STUDY OF EAGLE KALE STANDING STOP ON EXPOSURES HAVE ALSO MADE SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS AND TYPE OF CANCER AND ALL THE SAME ORGANS AT ALSO EXPOSED TO ONLY TWO G. RADIATION WHY DO WE KNOW BUDGET THAT BECAUSE- IT IS THE RELEASE OF THE ENTIRE MICROWAVE SPECTRUM WHICH WILL CONTINUE. TO INCLUDE THE FORGIVENESS ON IT FORTY THREE G. TWO G. NONE OF IT'S GOING AWAY BUT THE ENTIRE. STAFF IS BEING. AUCTIONED OFF LIKE WITHOUT OVERSIGHT A REGULAR YOU SEE THAT THE THING THE RESULT DOOR BE AND GOT THE PURPOSE OF FIVE G. ALONG WITH ALL THE NEEDS BRING ON THE OF THINGS CREATING A WORLD WHERE ALL THINGS ARE CHIPPED CAPABLE TO WAY TRANSMISSION TO ALL LIVING AND NON LIVING THINGS. ARE COUNTED FOR CONTROLLED SURVEILLED AND DATALOG INTO GLOBAL MAIN MAINFRAME ALL DONE WIRELESSLY USING ALL THE G. TO COME THAT SHE'D NEED GOAL OF CALL SURVEILLANCE DOWNLOAD THE BILL OF BERMAN THEY YOUR DWELLING WITHIN THESE WITH THE WRAPPING MICROWAVE RADIATION TECHNOLOGIES BEING HIGH FREQUENCY MILLIMETER WAVE GIVES OFF THE SAME DOSE OF RADIATION AND AIRPORT GUARANTEE SAME MILLIMETER WAVE HAVE BEEN USED BY THE U. S. ARMY AS CROWD CONTROL THE BURKE THE WEAPON CALLED ACTIVE DENIAL SYSTEM THE COMBINATION OF THE NEW FIVE G. MICROWAVE TECHNOLOGY ALONG WITH SMART METERS MIGHT JUST BE. BECOME AN ALL IN ONE WEAPONS AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IF I CAN. ASK YOU DIRECTLY IS NOT IT'S ALWAYS BETTER IN THE CAN MARICANN AND LIFE AS WELL THE- OF BEES HAVE BEEN DEAD AND NINE EIGHT CHILDREN WITH THEIR ACCOUNTS YOURSELF PHONE TOWERS NEXT TO THE WE'RE NEXT TO THE TOWER TRANSCENDED HUNDREDS OF PEER REVIEWED STUDIES AROUND THE WORLD THE LIST LINKED IF NON IONIZING FORMS ELECTROMAGNET THE EIGHT MINUTE RADIATION TO CANCER DNA DAMAGE INFERTILITY LEARNING AND MEMORY DEFICITS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GENERAL WELL BEING IN HUMANS FOLLOW THE SCIENCE THE RISK OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINETY HOUR WORK FOR HIM ON THE- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE THANK YOU WILL GO TO LINE TWENTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. I'M GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MELISSA MCCARTHY I'M IN SHOCK THE COUNTY- I'D LIKE TO- SAY THE GENTLEMAN THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IT WASN'T UP TO COUNTY LEVEL. TO THE FIVE FIVE G. FIVE G. DECISIONS AND I WOULD DISAGREE. I WOULD SAY YES ABSOLUTELY IS UP TO LOCAL LEVEL POLITICS NOT ABOUT AND WHERE WE CAN ONLY BE HEARD- I WANT TO READ THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH FOLLOW SUIT FOR MANY YEARS LARGE GROUPS WITH A DIFFERENT BALL AROUND THE REAL WORLD INCLUDING IN ANOTHER HAVE BEEN WORKING TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF ELECTRO MAGNETIC FIELDS AND RADIATION AND ARE CONSTANTLY ASKING THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR CITIZENS. IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE AS ANOTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD THERE PLEASE GO UNANSWERED SO THAT IS MY FEAR THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN HERE AS WELL. ON THE PRETEXT OF- JUST HAVING FASTER INTERNET AND NOT BEING BEHIND OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA. AND JAPAN ALSO FROM TRACTOR DOT DOT COM SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY PARENTS BELIEVE RADIATION FROM A FIVE G. CELL TOWERS CAUSING CANCER IN SCHOOL CHILDREN DOCTORS HAVE DIAGNOSED AT LEAST FOR KIDS FROM THE COUNTY BELUM ENTRY CONSISTENT. PARENTS BELIEVE THAT ONE SPECIFIC CELL TOWER POSES THE BIGGEST HEALTH CONCERNS. WE HAD A DOCTOR TELL US THAT IT'S A 100% ENVIRONMENTAL THE KIND OF TUMOR THAT HE HAD SAID MONICA THOROUGHLY. FROM CVS SACRAMENTO SO THAT IS MY COMMENT AND I TO OUT OF ANECDOTE WHEN I INTO A HOUSE THAT I WAS BRANCHING AT ONE TIME. I HAD BOUGHT ENOUGH RADIATION INSTRUMENT TO GAUGE BECAUSE I LIVED UNDER- TELL TELLER LINE AND IT'S NOT THE ACTUAL POWER THAT HOLDS THE LINE BUT THESE ARE JUST YOUR REGULAR LINE- OR- YOU KNOW FOR ENERGY BUT IF THE LINES THEMSELVES THAT YOU CAN HEAR. YOU CAN HEAR THE ELECTROMAGNETIC. FIELDS AND SO I HAD THE EMF RADIATION METER AND I WALKED OUT THERE AND IT WOULD BE VERY HIGH IN THE HIGHER LEVELS FOR EMF AND RF RADIATION SO THANKS THAT'S NOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING. YOUR- YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU NEXT CALL A PLACE THANK YOU A LOT MOVED TO LINE OF EIGHTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN YEAH HI MY NAME STANDS ON THIS AND I WORK FOR EIGHTEEN FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AND HAD STARTED SPICING CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT WHILE TO SILICON VALLEY AND I'VE SEEN. THE SAME TECHNOLOGY TWENTY YEARS AGO STILL GOING INTO THE GROUND IN THE VALLEY YEAH I'LL ACTUALLY I HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THE SOCIAL CONTRACT OR COMMITMENTS MADE TO RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE PROOF OF THAT IS THE DISMAL FAILURE OF ONLINE LEARNING MANY GIRL CHILDREN THE POOR SIGNAL QUALITY OF THOSE WIFI HOT SPOT IN THE LACK OF ANY OTHER OPTION. BECAUSE ACTUALLY CAUSED THE DEATH OF NEURAL PATHWAYS BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO LEARN IN SOME CASES THEIR CHILDREN THAT I'M AWARE OF THEY ACTUALLY COMMITTED SUICIDE FIVE G. IS A MYTH. LIKE SEEDING THE CLOUDS ARE THE LOW ORBIT SATELLITES- BASICALLY THAT WILL TAKE A GENERATION OR MORE TO DEPLOY. AND IT WILL HAVE IT WILL BE ANOTHER GENERATION OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE TO SUFFER WHILE THEY WAIT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE MEANTIME YOU CAN DEPLOY FIBER NOW. THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE IS THAT THEY COULD FOR THE AMOUNT OF FIBERS THAT I'VE SEEN GOING INTO THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. WHICH ARE AS YOU SAID THOUSAND FIBER CABLES. AND WITH THE WITH THE- THE GLOBAL. SUPPLY CHAIN. TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEHIND WHICH THE CEO OF A TNT THANK HE ADMITTED RECENTLY. YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO PUT ALL THOSE CHIPS AND CHIPSETS AND CIRCUIT BOARDS AND FIBER IN TERMINALS AND EQUIPMENT IN THE GROUND FOR FIVE G. WELL I WILL COMMUNITIES WAIT. FOR A COUPLE OF MILES THE BY DO YOU COULD LIGHT UP A RURAL COMMUNITY WITH WITH THE OPTICAL FIBER TO THE NODE OR TO THE PLAN. NOT MANY FARMWORKERS HAVE FIVE PEOPLE INTO SELF DRIVING CARS THAT'S THAT TOTALLY JUSTICE IN GOTTA STOP WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TURN IT AROUND NOW BUT WE HAVE TO FIND LEGISLATORS AGAIN I. CAN'T HAVE THE FORTITUDE TO DO SO TO OPPOSE THE INDUSTRY I'VE SEEN THE SMALL CELL- FIVE THREE THREE THREE OR THE- QUIRK MILK BLANK. TOLD THE COMMITTEES. WITH NO OPPOSITE IT'S JUST LIKE WHEN DIRECT BY SEVERAL YEARS AGO OR YEARS AGO WITH VIA AND UNDER SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO DO SO THANK IS AN ORIGINALLY THE LEGISLATURE LET LET THAT FLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL NEXT CALL A PLACE THANK YOU AND WE WILL GO TO LINE OF TWENTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD HELLO MY NAME IS TANYA AND I'M CALLING FROM SAN JOSE. PLEASE DO NOT PUT ANY MORE FIVE G. IN CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT WANT TO BE IRRADIATED BY ELECTROMAGNETIC FREQUENCIES THAT ARE HARMFUL TO HELP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL YEAR OLD I'M NOT DONE OKAY PLEASE CONTINUE. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CALL OR NEAR RESIDENTIAL AREAS AT THE MORAL WE WOULD BE HARMING PEOPLE EXPENSES TO BE. IMPLEMENTED HAVE IT BE IMPLEMENTED FAR AWAY FROM PEOPLE AND OPPOSE IT ALTOGETHER WELL BETTER GAS THANK YOUNG THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER COLOR THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OUR LAST CALL FOR ANYBODY HERE IN THE ROOM.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US- INCLUDING- THE PANELISTS AND THE CALLERS AS WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERTISE AND- ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE LOSS OF AUDIO- IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PRECEDING SOUL WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS TO- PERHAPS REPEAT WHAT I. BRIEFLY WHAT I SAID EARLIER WHAT I SAID WAS THAT THAT CALIFORNIA IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF BOTH INNOVATION AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA CAN AT TIMES HAVE A PROFOUND. IMPACT ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND HOW IT ADDRESSES TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AND I'VE THERE'S ONE THING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM OUR ROLE. IS ELSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TOP TECH HUBS IN THE WORLD IT IS THAT INNOVATION BRINGS WITH IT- THE ABILITY TO TACKLE ISSUES AND- THEY'RE ALSO CHALLENGES NOW THE INTENT OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO LEARN ABOUT SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. AND CHALLENGES OF FIVE G. TECHNOLOGY BY GAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS ITS ECONOMIC POTENTIAL THE EMERGING TRENDS DRIVEN BY IT AND WHAT GOES INTO THE BUILDING- IN IMPLEMENTING THESE NETWORKS AND LET ME UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT THIS HEARING IS. AN INTRODUCTION INTO FIVE G. AND MAY BE FOLLOWED UP WITH ADDITIONAL HEARINGS TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS AND SPECIFIC ISSUES OF FIVE G. FOR CALIFORNIA AND AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATION I HOPE TO CONTINUE TO. HOLD THESE TYPES OF HEARING IN THE FUTURE IN ORDER TO DO A DEEPER DIVE INTO A MORE- RODNEY ONCE THOSE SITUATIONS- AND SURELY THIS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE AMONG VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND I DO ENCOURAGE ALL PARTICIPANTS. ARE TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME AND IF YOU HAVE ANY WRITTEN TESTIMONIES PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SEND IT OVER TO US I WILL BE SURE. TO RECEIVE IT AND I REVIEW THE I'M SO WITH I AGAIN YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION INCLUDING THE STAFF HERE IN THIS ROOM AS WELL AS ALL THE- STAFF MEMBERS WHO HELPED MAKE THIS A REALITY SO WITHOUT DOUBT.
