PORTION.

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.301
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.036
THAT FOR AN ONLINE SALE.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.805
THE CITY AND COUNTY THAT ARE

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.006
ENTITLED TO THE BRADLEY BURNS

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:58.774
PORTION DEPENDS ON THE PHYSICAL

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.510
LOCATION OF WHERE THE SALE TOOK

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.145
PLACE SO FOR RETAIL SALES IT'S

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:03.479
VERY CLEAR IF YOU BUY SOMETHING

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:04.814

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.823
THE PEOPLE THAT GET THE ON THE

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.358
BARELY PRINCE PORTION OF THE

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:17.160
LOCAL SALES TAX IS DEPENDS ON

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.261
WHERE THEY ARE.

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:19.929
SHIPMENT ORIGINATES FROM NOT

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.330
WHERE TO SHIP TO SO WHAT WE'RE

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.666
SEEING IS CITIES WITH LARGE

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:24.767
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.169
STATE ARE GETTING ALL OF THIS

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:27.803
TAX REVENUE BACK AT STARVING THE

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.272
CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT DON'T

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:30.273
HAVE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WITHIN

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:31.007
THEM.

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.708
SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:33.342
CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR MADE A

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:35.111
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE ADDRESS

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:36.946

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:37.547
THAT YET.

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:39.115
BUT IT'S CAUSING TERRIBLE

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:40.416
BEHAVIOR WE'RE SEEING CITIES AND

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:41.817
COUNTIES THAT ARE ENTERING INTO

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.286
AGREEMENTS WERE THE REBATE AS

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.855
MUCH AS 90% OF THAT TAX BACK TO

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.523

LOCATING THESE ONLINE CENTERS.

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.493
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO I THINK

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.861
WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS THE

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.829
SITUATION AND GET THAT REVENUE

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:54.964

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:57.767
CITIES AND COUNTIES WHERE IT

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:58.601
