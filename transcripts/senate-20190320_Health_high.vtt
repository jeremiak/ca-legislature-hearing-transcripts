EXPERIMENT --

00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:00.231
I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:01.899
FOR FOUR YEARS AND STARTING MY

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:05.269
SECOND TERM AND ONE OF MY MY

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.637
ISSUES.

00:35:06.704 --> 00:35:08.139
BIG ISSUES IN THE STATE HAS BEEN

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:09.073
WITH THE MEDICAL PROGRAM.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.908
THAT --

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.944
DURING THE 200-082-0009

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.479
RECESSION --

00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:16.514
WE GAVE SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO THE

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:18.449
PROGRAM 10%.

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:19.784
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.486
REINSTATED WE WE'VE HAD SOME

00:35:21.552 --> 00:35:22.820
PROPOSITION MONEY THIS BEEN BACK

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:24.755
FILLING --

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:26.557
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT.

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:27.892
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PHYSICIANS

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:29.293
THE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.728
MEDICARE PROGRAM PUTTING MANAGED

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.330
CARE ASIDE.

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:34.532
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T PAY.

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:35.500
AN APPROPRIATE FEE FOR THEM TO

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:37.768
PARTICIPATE [inaudible]

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:42.406
AND SO.

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:44.742
THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:47.345
JUST RE RELEASED A REPORT --

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:48.379
IT WAS JUST THIS LAST WEEK

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.881
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN THE

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:50.781
MEDICAL PROGRAM WERE NOT

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.617
RECEIVING PREVENTATIVE HEALTH

00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:54.752
SERVICES AND I KNOW THAT THE THE

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.554
CHAIRMAN UNDERSTANDS AS BEING --

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:59.624
IN THE STEAM THE PEDIATRICIAN.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.926
AN AVERAGE AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:02.927
TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.362
ARE ENROLLED IN THE MEDICARE ALL

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:05.596
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND NOT

00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:06.964
RECEIVED ALL OF THE PRESENTED

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:09.200
PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:09.800
THAT THE STATE IS COMMITTED TO

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:11.068
PROVIDE THEM.

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.703
THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.038
AND PREVENTION PROVIDE CHILDREN

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.373
WITH AN ANNUAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:16.407
SERVICES SAVES THOUSANDS OF

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:18.009
LIVES A REDUCES FUTURE HEALTH

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.610
COSTS BY THE THOUSANDS OF

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.412
DOLLARS PER CHILD.

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:24.115
SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS SENATOR IS

00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:26.484
THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF HEALTH

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.119
CARE DELIVERY.

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:29.487
THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN.

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:31.022
BUT HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERING THE

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:33.491
SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN PROMISED.

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:35.026
TO THE BENEFICIARIES AS THEY

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.695
EXIST TODAY.

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:40.698
BY INCLUDING THIS POPULATION --

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:41.799
WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDING A

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:44.168
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:47.772
THE MEDICAL ROLES --

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:49.240
AT SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE I KNOW

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:50.474
THERE'S BEEN NO --

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:51.876
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THIS IS

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:53.678
GONNA COSTS IN THE IN YOUR BILL

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.146
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S IN EXCESS OF

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:56.781
TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE

00:36:56.847 --> 00:36:58.449
ALL UNDOCUMENTED IS WITH --

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:01.018
MEDI CAL OF SERVICES AND YOU CAN

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:01.586
CORRECT ME CERTAINLY IF I'M

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:02.587
WRONG.

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:04.355
BY ADDING AT THIS NUMBER OF

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:06.357
PEOPLE TO THE EXISTING.

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.792
ROLES THAT ARE GOING TO BE SEEN

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:09.727
BY.

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:11.429
THE FEW POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:13.064
IS GOING TO EVEN FOR THE DELUDE.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.198
THE AVAILABILITY OF PHYSICIANS

00:37:14.265 --> 00:37:16.100
TO SEE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:17.535
SYSTEM TODAY.

00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:20.471
SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS.

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:21.472
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:23.040
TO GET THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN

00:37:23.107 --> 00:37:24.842
SHAPE SO THAT WE CAN REALLY SAY

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.310
THAT IT IS HEALTHY TO ACCEPT

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:31.115
MORE PATIENCE NUMBER ONE NUMBER --

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:33.117
TWO DO YOU AVE ANY IDEA IF

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.486
YOU'RE GOING TO CAP THE NUMBER

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:36.320
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE

00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:37.722
ENROLLED IN THIS PROGRAM OR

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:39.023
YOU'RE GOING TO CAP.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.491
THE AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURE IN

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.627
THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE I'M GONNA

00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:44.462
SUGGESTED OPINED THAT IF WE PASS

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:45.696
THIS IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNS AND

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.198
AS HE'S INDICATED THAT HE

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.299
PROBABLY WILL.

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:49.400
THAT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT WE ARE

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.068
GOING TO SEE MORE IMMIGRANTS

00:37:51.135 --> 00:37:53.137
COMING INTO CALIFORNIA TO SEEK

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:55.072
THE SERVICES THAT --

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:56.674
SO WE DON'T HEAR SOME OF THE

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:59.176
TERRIBLE STORIES THAT WE WE SEE

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:00.811
SO.

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:03.347
IF YOU CANCEL QUESTIONS HERE.

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:05.249
WELL LET ME START WITH THE LAST --

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:05.883
ONE I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY ADULT

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.817
LIFE.

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:07.985
WITH --

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:10.054
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND IMMIGRANT

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:11.055
WORKERS.

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.823
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.091
THAT THE REASON THEY COME TO

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:14.659
THIS COUNTRY IS NOT FOR THE

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:15.559
HEALTH [inaudible]

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:17.228
HEALTH CARE.

00:38:17.294 --> 00:38:19.530
ON THAT IS NOT WHAT DRIVES THEM.

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:21.265
WHAT DRIVES THEM IS WHAT PUSHES

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:23.167
THEM OUT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.436
COUNTRIES? EIGHT LIVE IN

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:27.438
ABSOLUTE.

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.440
LIFE AND DEATH POVERTY THAT IS

00:38:29.507 --> 00:38:30.941
WHY THEY RISK THEIR LIVES THAT

00:38:31.008 --> 00:38:33.711
IS WHY HUNDRED DIE EACH YEAR.

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.312
CROSSING THE BORDER.

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:38.349
SO AT THAT KIND OF CLARITY OR

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:41.252
THEY FACE ENORMOUS VIOLENCE.

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:42.687
IN WHICH THEY CAN.

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:43.921
EVERY DAY MEMBERS OF THE

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:45.256
FAMILIES FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:46.624
ARE GETTING KILLED BECAUSE OF

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.025
THE VIOLENCE SO.

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:50.795
I ASSURE YOU AFTER MANY DECK

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.263
COMMUNITY.

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.831
HEALTH INSURANCE OR HAVING A

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:55.099
DRIVER'S LICENSE OR ANYTHING

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:57.435
LIKE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.636
WHAT DRIVES THEM THEY WOULD

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:00.805
PREFER TO STAY IN THEIR HOME

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:02.206
COUNTRIES.

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:06.477
ARM WITH REGARDS --

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:07.945
TO YOU KNOW I AM NOT YET AN

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:10.314
EXPERT ON MEDI CAL SO I I

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:11.882
COULDN'T PRETEND TO ANSWER SOME

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:13.451
OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND THERE MAY

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:14.652
BE OTHERS.

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.187
HERE BUT I WOULD SAY.

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:18.089
OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS AN

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:19.590
EFFICIENT SYSTEM.

00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:21.792
AN EFFICIENT SYSTEM THAT GIVES

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:24.195
HEALTH CARE. TO ALL.

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:26.731
IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:29.767
TO RESORT. TO ONLY EMERGENCY

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:31.635
SERVICES --

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:34.672
AND I THINK WE SHOULD GET MORE

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.440
OF THOSE NUMBERS.

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:38.542
BABY TO TERM FOR ME TO REALLY

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:41.579
BACKED THAT UP BUT I KNOW HAVING

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:45.116
BEEN INVOLVED WITH HEALTH CARE --

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:47.651
PLANS. FOR OVER DECADES.

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:52.189
THAT AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:53.791
NEGOTIATE WITH THE PROVIDERS AND

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:56.160
TO SAY KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:57.895
EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THE COST

00:39:57.962 --> 00:39:59.563
IS SO HIGH.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.565
AND RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:03.467
IS WE'RE PUSHING THEM TO THE

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:05.536
EMERGENCY ROOMS WE'RE STILL

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:07.738
PAYING CALIFORNIANS ARE PAIN FOR

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:09.640
THOSE EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:12.309
WE'RE PAYING FOR LAST MINUTE.

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:14.044
UP VISITS --

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:16.680
SO IT'S NOT LIKE THERE THERE AND

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:19.083
WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUT ANY MONEY

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.551
RIGHT NOW WE'RE PAYING.

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:21.819
QUESTION FOR US IS DO WE HAVE A

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:24.522
SMARTER PLAN. TO COVER THEM AT

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:26.457
THE GIVEN THE ATTENTION.

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:28.993
WE IF WE DO NOT GIVE IT IT'S NOT

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.661
JUST THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.329
MEMBERS WHO SUFFER.

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.598
BUT IMAGINE THE PREVENT THE

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.001
PREVENTION OF DIABETES THE

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:39.737
PREVENTION OF RESPIRATORY.

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:42.206
AILMENTS THERE'S SO MANY THINGS

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:44.475
THAT COST US.

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:46.477
BILLIONS I CAN GUARANTEE YOU

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.245
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:49.914
SO WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.048
SMARTER.

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.082
ABOUT THINKING THAT SOMEHOW

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:54.351
WE'RE SAVING MONEY WHEN IN FACT

00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:55.786
WE'RE SPENDING MORE.

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:57.388
SO -- I'M

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:59.156
SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.458
NUMBERS FOR YOU AND WE'LL WORK

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:02.226
ON IT MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE HERE

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.260
WHO.

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:04.929
CAN PROVIDE THAT --

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:07.898
BUT THAT'S THE WAY I'VE SEEN.

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:09.200
THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE MY

00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:10.601
WHOLE LIFE I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:12.136
ANSWERS AND AND I APPRECIATE

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:14.738
YOUR COMPASSION AND I APPRECIATE

00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:17.708
YOUR PASSION. FOR WHAT YOU'RE

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:19.844
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE TODAY --

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.111
I'M UNFORTUNATELY NOT GOING TO

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:23.113
GO TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.415
NOT LET ME EXPLAIN WHY.

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:25.983
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE WE

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.918
ARE NOT A COMPASSIONATE STATE I

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.587
THINK WE ARE COMPASSIONATE STATE

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:31.188
WHEN I USE MY PERSONAL MONEY.

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:32.957
HI I DONATE TO CAUSES THAT HELP

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:34.325
UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN MY

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:35.793
DISTRICT --

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:36.794
BUT WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.095
TAXPAYER MONEY.

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.663
AND USUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.800
BILLS YOU HAVE TO MAKE A NEXUS

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:43.801
TO THE BUDGET OF THE STATE.

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.536
AND SO THIS IS GOING TO BE --

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:48.105
A VERY EXPENSIVE --

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.273
LAW.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.075
IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:52.810
MAYBE MORE AS YOU PROBABLY SAID.

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.879
SO IT BASICALLY COMES TO A

00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:56.347
MATTER OF PRIORITIZATION IN THE

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.282
STATE BUDGET.

00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.583
AND WE ARE A STATE THAT HAS SOME

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.752
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WE HAVE A

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:03.821
SIGNIFICANT HOMELESS ISSUE.

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:06.023
WE HAVE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:06.590
THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE THE

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:07.524
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:09.526
PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.462
STATE PER CAPITA --

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:13.430
WE HAVE --

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:15.032
VETERANS THAT ARE IN DIRE NEED

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.301
OF OF HELP --

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:19.270
WE HAVE SENIOR CITIZENS THAT ARE

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:19.837
STRUGGLING TO STAY IN THEIR

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:24.975
HOMES -- SO.

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.844
AS WE LOOK AT BILLS LIKE THIS WE

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:28.979
GOT TO TAKE IT IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:31.949
PRIORITIZING THE THE NEEDS OF OF

00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:32.216
THE STATE.

00:42:32.283 --> 00:42:35.519
AND IF IF MONEY WAS LIMóN LESS

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.354
I WOULD BE JOINING YOU 1100% THE

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.889
MONEY IS NOT LIMITLESS IT IS

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:39.690
FINITE.

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:40.691
AND BASED ON THE NUMBERS ARE

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:41.926
COMING INTO THE STATE COFFERS

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.160
THESE DAYS --

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:44.662
WE'RE SEEING --

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.196
MAYBE A DOWNWARD TREND IN OUR

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:47.131
PROJECTIONS.

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.966
SO IN THAT WILL LIMIT WHAT ARE

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:50.267
SPENDING CAN BE.

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:51.735
BUT I THINK THAT THESE OTHER

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:54.104
NEEDS AND AND OUR CHILDREN --

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:55.372
THAT WE'VE BEEN APART PROVIDE

00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:56.807
EARLY HEAD CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:59.209
ALL THESE PROGRAMS HAVE PRICE

00:42:59.276 --> 00:43:00.144
TAGS.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:03.380
AND I THINK IN MY MIND THOSE

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:04.982
ALREADY RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:06.283
CITIZENS THAT ARE HERE.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.252
THAT ARE DOCUMENTED AND THEN WE

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.954
HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY THAT WE

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.189
CAN AFFORD TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.425
POPULATIONS IN AND PHILANTHROPIC

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:15.726
AND CHARITABLE WAYS I WON HER

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.294
PERCENT BEHIND IT.

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:18.696
BUT AT THIS POINT TIME I CREDIT

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:19.697
ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:20.564
HAVE IN THE STATE THEY WERE

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:21.966
HAVING TROUBLE FINDING THESE

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:22.700
THESE DAYS AND AT BUT IT

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:44.722
MY OPINION THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:45.589
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:47.324

A DEEP CONCERN THAT IF THE STATE

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:22.779
THIS POPULATION CURRENTLY

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:24.047
RECEIVE SERVICES.

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:25.682
SO I WOULDN'T WANT US TO PULL

00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:27.251
DOLLARS BACK FROM THOSE AREAS

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:29.052
WELL WE DON'T GET THE UP TAKE A

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:31.955
MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT OUT OF FEAR.

00:46:32.022 --> 00:46:33.657
YOU FOLLOW ME.

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:36.126
WHAT WHAT SAY YOU [inaudible]

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:38.162
WELL --

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.429
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FINAL

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:40.597
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:42.733
FINAL DECISION WILL BE ON PUBLIC

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:43.734
CHARGE.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.369
WE DON'T KNOW HOW BROAD OR HOW

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.638
DEEP THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.973
CHARGE COULD BE ARE IN FACT IT

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.275
COULD BE.

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:53.277
FOR GETTING A FREE MEAL.

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:54.378
ALL IN SCHOOL.

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:56.747
IF IF THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE

00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:59.316
EVIL ENOUGH TO PUT THAT FORWARD.

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:01.518
I DON'T THINK THEN THAT SHOULD

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:04.087
PUSHES BACK FROM.

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:06.657
CONTINUING TO PROVIDE THE NEEDS

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:08.392
OF THIS COMMUNITY I THINK THIS

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.160
COULD BE A NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:11.728
PARTICIPATE AT EVERY LEVEL.

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:14.031
I'D I WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED

00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:17.034
ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY --

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.670
BY THE GOING FURTHER UNDERGROUND.

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:22.139
ON A ON A LOT OF OTHER LEVELS

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:23.941
AND IT IS A BIG CONCERN.

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:25.375
I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD HOLD

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:28.445
US BACK THAT WERE THEIR

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:29.680
UNDERGROUND MAYBE IF WE PUT

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:31.315
RESOURCES AND THERE WE COULD GET

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:33.150
MORE INCOME TO THE STATE LIKE

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:34.351
WAY TO THE LEFT.

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:35.819
ALL WAGE THEFT --

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:38.021
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BILLIONS OF

00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:41.158
DOLLARS ALL BY ITSELF COULD PAY

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:43.160
FOR THIS AND MORE HEALTH CARE.

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:45.295
SO MAYBE IF WE INVESTED OUR

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:47.130
RESOURCES THE RIGHT WAY NOT ONLY

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.066
WOULD WE ADDRESS WAGE THEFT AND

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.801
BRING IN MORE MONEY BUT WE WOULD

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.169
BEGIN TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:53.837
UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY.

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:55.239

PROTECTIONS ACROSS THE BOARD IN

I'M SURE THERE IS A MORE

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.050

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:54.570

LET'S TALK A LOOK TOPICAL LIQUID

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.240
THAT IS SIMPLY BRUSHED ON TO THE

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.147

TREATMENT IS NOT OPTIMAL.

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:03.806
ADDITIONALLY IT REQUIRES

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.523
I'M SUPPORTIVE BUT I JUST TO

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:28.791
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:30.859
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE. ONE OF

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:32.761
THE INCENTIVES HERE'S THAT IT'S

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:35.965
LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A TREATMENT

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:37.333
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THE CAUSE

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.134
MEDIC IMPACT IS THERE ANY

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.669
DISTINCTION MADE BY A TREATING

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.305
DENTIST FOR A CHILD IF IT.

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:44.340
TO BACK TO THROUGH HER FRONT

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.275
TOOTH IN TERMS OF THE COSMETIC

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:46.575
[inaudible]

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.477
IMPACT.

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:49.845
I KNOW THE BABY TEETH FALL OUT

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:53.549
BUT STILL FOR A THE KINDERGARTEN --

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.017
FIRST GRADER --

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:58.687
HE COULD TIAS STIGMATIZING --

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.523
TREATMENT SELECTION.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.658
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:03.792
THAT QUESTION --

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:04.793
SO CERTAINLY WHEN THE CONCERNS

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.929
ABOUT THIS TREATMENT IS IS THAT

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:08.097
DOES CAUSE A DISCOLORATION TO

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:10.299
TOOTH CAUSES IT TO THAT THE DARK

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:11.834
IN COLOR WHERE IT'S APPLIED.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.904
AND ONE THING I'D MAKE NOTE IS

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:17.306
MEANT AND THAT'S WHY WITH WE'VE

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:19.108
PARTICULARLY TARGETED --

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.743
THESE THREE POPULATIONS AND IN

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:23.612
INTERMS OF OFTENTIMES THESE ARE

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.713
PATIENTS WHERE.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.483
DID PATIENT MAY NEED SEDATION OR

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:29.084
OTHER TYPES OF WHICH MAY BE NOT

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:30.719
AS READILY ACCESSIBLE AND SO

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.588
IDEALLY IF PATIENTS ABLE TO

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.890
TOLERATE AND RELEASE AS FULL WE

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.725
WOULD JUST GO AND DO THE FILLING

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:37.893
RIGHT AND GET AND GET IT DONE

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.094
RIGHT TAKE CARE TAKE CARE OF THE

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:39.328
DENTAL.

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:41.330
CARIES HOWEVER --

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:42.998
IN OUT IN THOSE OTHER CASES THE

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:44.099
ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT THIS

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:45.601
TREATMENT ALSO DOES IT THE REST

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.969
THE FURTHER PROGRESSION SO WHAT

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.337
HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE A DENTAL

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:49.571
CARIES RIGHT.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.407
AND IT'S AND YOU SAY WELL I

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:52.207
CAN'T TREAT IT NOW BECAUSE I

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:53.876
CAN'T PUT HIM UNDER SEDATION I

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:56.879
DON'T HAVE THE THE AND THEN WHAT

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:58.013
HAPPENS USING THIS TREATMENT

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.048
ACTUALLY ARRESTED FOR THE

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:00.315
PROGRESSIONS WHAT I SEE IS A

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:01.750
PEDIATRICIAN AS I HAVE A PATIENT

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:02.818
COMES AND WHO HAS A DENTAL.

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:04.553
CARIES AND THEN WILL HAPPEN IS

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.121
THAT BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET HIM

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.623
INTO THE OTHER FACILITY.

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.224
IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND I'LL

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.826
TELL YOU THAT BY THE WAY HOW WE

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.394
TALK ABOUT BABY TEETH YOUR ADULT

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:14.096
TEETH RIGHT BEHIND SO WHEN YOU

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.664
KNOW YOUR CHILD ISN'T A BABY

01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:16.632
TEETH YOU KNOW THE DAHLE TEETH

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:17.166
COMING STREET.

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:19.735
RIGHT BEHIND AND ACTUALLY IF YOU

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.838
CAN'T THE CAT THE CAVITY OR

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.473
DENTAL CARIES WILL GO STRAIGHT

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.307
THROUGH THE BABY TEETH IT

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.775
ACTUALLY AFFECT THE ADULT TO

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:28.477
BEFORE EVEN POPS OUT.

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:29.712
SO THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.313
THIS IS AN OPTION TO HOPE THAT

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.815
PROGRESSION I THINK IT'S

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.116
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT'S ONE

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.517
THE REASONS WHY I THINK THIS IS

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:36.452
SO IMPORTANT WE MAKE THIS A

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:37.553
COVERED ENTITY I APPRECIATE THE

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.088
CLARIFICATION I STILL THINK

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:42.157
THERE'S A BIT OF AN ECONOMIC --

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:44.660
DETERMINANT HERE I UNDERSTAND

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:47.296
SEDATION RAISES OTHER POTENTIAL

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:49.164
MEDICAL RISKS AND YOU GOTTA SEE

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:51.800

FOR THAT IT SET TREATMENT --

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.004

PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE SO

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:57.960

SEE WHAT THE AFFECTS ARE AND AND

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:25.354
THEY'RE PRETTY SEVERE THINKING

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.321
OF A CHILD THAT STARTS

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.323
KINDERGARTEN GOES TO FIRST GRADE

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:29.324
AND STOREHOUSES.

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:31.693
DISCOLORATION WHICH IS AGAIN IN

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.395
MY OPINION PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SO

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:34.329
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:35.931
DENTISTRY BUT I WANTED TO JUST

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.566
GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM YOU.

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.268
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY MY

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:40.769
QUESTION WOULD HAVE BEEN AS

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:43.272
THERE MEMORY AS IT PERTAINS TO A

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.440
DECADE BEFORE THE TWO FALLS AND

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:46.642
THEN THE TWO K..

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.143
AFTER WHEN THE NEW ONE FALLS IN

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.111
I THOUGHT I JUST HEARD YOU SAY

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:49.444
THAT.

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:50.545
THAT IS.

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:51.813
THE ONE THAT'S COMING OUT IS

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.682
COMING RIGHT AFTER THAT

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:55.450
SOMETIMES THERE'S IMPACT TO THE

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:57.219
NEW TOOTH CRACKED YES IT WOULD

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.453
DOUBLE TO WHAT HAPPENS OF COURSE

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.155
THE DENTAL CARIES IS A CUT CALL

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.790
CAVITIES HOLE IN THE TOOTH RIGHT

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.325
TO THE BACK TO SPEEDING THROUGH

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.493
THE TOOTH.

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:07.396
AND IF YOU HAVE A BABY TWO SETS

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:09.064
HAS AN ADULT TO PUT WE'LL BE

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:10.299
RIGHT BEHIND IT IF IT ACTUALLY

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:11.433
EATS THROUGH FAR ENOUGH IT WILL

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.302
THEN START ON THE ADULT TO

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:14.703
SWITCH IS RIGHT.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.538
BEHIND THE THE BABY TOOTH SO YOU

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:18.040
COULD ACTUALLY HAVE IF YOU DON'T

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:20.075
STOP THE KERRY SOME CONTINUING.

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:21.777
I CAN GO STRAIGHT INTO THE ADULT

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:25.514
TO STEPPED THAT DID THAT'S GOING

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:26.448
TO COME OUT --

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:27.516
MY OTHER QUESTION IS AND I KNOW

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:27.749
THAT --

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:28.383
EVENTUALLY THAT THEY WILL FALL

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:29.651
OUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:31.486
STUFF WHAT HAPPENS BUT ANOTHER

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:33.055
QUESTION FOR ME IS IS THERE

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:34.323
ANOTHER WAY WERE MAYBE THEY CAN

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:36.558
PULL OUT THE TEETH IN THE REASON

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:37.192
I SAY THIS BECAUSE I WOULD HATE

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:38.160
TO SEE HIM.

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.494
CHILDREN THAT NEED IT THE ONES

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:40.929
THAT CAN AFFORD IT ALL WALKING

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:42.631
AND NOT ALL BUT WALKING AROUND

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:43.699
WITH DISCOLORED TEETH AND THEN

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.167
THE ONES ARE MORE AFFLUENT THAT

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:45.901
COULD AFFORD A WALKING AROUND

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:46.668
WITH.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.003
BETTER TEETH IT JUST YOU KNOW

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.237
SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU START THAT

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:51.773
THE DIVISION IN TERMS OF EQUITY

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.975
IN ECONOMICS --

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.343
I JUST WANT TO KNOW THERE'S ANY

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.345
OTHER OPTIONS FOR THAT LIKE

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:59.348
PULLING OUT A TEETH IS IN THERE

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.516
AN EASIER WAY FOR A CHILD.

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:02.884
I'M NOT A DENTIST SO I JUST KIND

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:03.151
OF WANT.

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:04.019
TO GET OUT ON THE MARKET SO

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.088
THERE ARE --

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:07.789
FIRST IF THE THE TWO THIEVES

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.925
STAINED BLACK WITH STF THERE ARE --

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:11.360
METHODS AFTER THE TOOTH IS

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:13.061
STABILIZED --

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:14.830
TO GO IN AND PUT IN A WHITE

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:17.632
FILLING OR PUT ON A VENEER --

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:20.669
SO THAT WE'VE STOPPED FIX THE

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:22.037
COLORATION UNTIL THE BABY TO

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:23.705
FALLS OUT --%

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:27.242
IN TERMS OF OTHER OPTIONS.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.678

HAVE TO GO IN AND DO SOME SOME.

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.853
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DENTISTRY TO

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:40.522
PUT CAPS ON AND SO THE PARENT

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:41.823
MIGHT DECIDE.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:42.891
MAKE THE DECISION WITH THE

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.160
DENTIST I'D RATHER AND AND WE

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:45.694
SEE THIS A LOT.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.796
REGARDLESS OF ECONOMIC STATUS

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:49.231
THE PARENTS AND THE DENTIST

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:50.999
HAVING A CONVERSATION AND SAYING

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:52.868
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D RATHER HAVE A

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:56.138
BLACK STAY IN THAN HAVE --

01:17:56.204 --> 01:17:58.440
THAT HAVE TO HAVE THEM YOU KNOW

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.875
UNDERGO --

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.309
SIGNIFICANT DENTISTRY OR UNDERGO

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:03.512
ANESTHESIA AND ON TOP OF THAT

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:05.147
YOU YOU WOULD DEFINITELY NOT

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:06.581
WANT TO PULL OUT A TOOTH THAT

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:08.283
COULD BE STABILIZED OTHERWISE

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.351
BECAUSE THEN.

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:11.620
THE TEETH MOVE OR THE IT DAMAGES

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:12.754
THE BONE SO --

01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:13.989
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:16.091
STABILIZE THE TWO FIRST BEFORE

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:18.393
YOU WITH THE LAST.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.027
DITCH EFFORT WOULD BE TO PULL IT

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.062
OUT.

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.329
OKAY SO SEE FASTER MY QUESTION

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:22.364
HE'S STILL A LITTLE BIT

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:23.932
CONCERNED ONLY BECAUSE I SAW TO

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:26.768
ME THE SEVERITY OF THAT THE

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:28.603
DISCOLORATION BUT BUT I YOU KNOW

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:29.738
ACT.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:30.305
GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.339
ABOUT HIM.

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:33.275
AND NOW MORE SOMETHING TO TO

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.743
MINIMIZE THE THE STAIN I MEAN

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.144
THEY'RE STILL COST ATTACHED TO

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:37.279
ITSELF.

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.547
MY OPINION MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:41.450
PARENTS WERE NOT TO HAVE

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:43.618
SOMETHING COVER THE STING BUT

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:44.653
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOR

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:45.620
SURE IN AYE AYE I HAD A LITTLE
