DID EXCELLENT WORK ON THIS BILL I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL AID TO THE AMENDMENTS ARE SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THREE YEARS AGO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED SP TWO FOUR SIX WHICH HAD AN OVER ARCHING GOAL OF ADDRESSING THE LACK OF A COOPERATIVE COORDINATED APPROACH THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION. BETWEEN THE STATE OUR REGIONS AND LOCALITIES LOOKED AT HER AND OTHER. LOCAL ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA SO WE DID THREE THINGS IT CREATED THIS INTEGRATED. CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND AYE RESILIENCY PROGRAM I CARP WHICH IS REFERENCED IN A. THE STAFF REPORT WHICH IS DESIGNED TO DEVELOP A COHESIVE AND COORDINATED RESPONSE TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ACROSS THE STATE TO PROVIDE FOR THE CREATION OF THE STATE CLIMATE ADAPTATION CLEARINGHOUSE. AND CONVENE THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY A COUNCIL TO PARA PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ON CLIMATE CLIMATE ADAPTATION I TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH SO. THIS BILL SP TWO SIX TWO BUILDS UPON AND CODIFIES THE GOOD WORK AT THE A. A OPR HAS BEEN DOING PURSUANT TO I SP TWO FOUR SIX A BY ENSURING THAT WE CONTINUE. BEYOND THIS ADMINISTRATION INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE TOOK THAT MAKE SOME ACHIEVEMENTS WE FORMALIZE DEAD TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND WE CALLED THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY. WE GIVE THE CCAR THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION CLEARING HOUSE WE REQUIRE THE CC A ARE TO OVERSEE THE AYE CARP.

A WIN THE STATE STARTED THINKING ABOUT ADAPTATION MANY YEARS AGO THERE WASN'T A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OR CONFERENCE OF LAW THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. BY THE. GOVERNOR THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH VARIOUS BILLS HAS TRIED TO PUT THAT PROGRAM TOGETHER. WE THINK THIS IS ANOTHER AT A EXCELLENT ADDITION TO THAT BODY OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE BREAKING DOWN SILOS IF THERE'S A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO HOW.

OKAY FOR SURE CENTER MONEY. WELCOME SIR. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER TWO SP TEN SEVENTY NINE. SO UNDERMINE THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON. I LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT SUGGESTING COMMENT THREE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ADDING PRIVATE FOR FOREST LANDOWNERS. TO THE BILL. SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY NINE AUTHORIZES THE DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE TO ALLOW ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR THE FORCED HEALTH GRANT IN FIRE PREVENTION FUND. GRANT PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING LARGER MORE INTENSE WILD FIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CAL FIRE HAS CHANGED ITS POLICY TO REQUIRE NON PROFITS SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT RECEIVE FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS TO BE REIMBURSED. BECAUSE REIMBURSEMENTS GENERALLY TAKE BETWEEN SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS A DELAYING AND FINANCIAL HARDSHIP CAN BE CREATED. S. B. TEN SEVENTY NINE IS TIMELY AS CAO FIRES CURRENTLY DISBURSING. APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT PROGRAM FUNDS. I HAVE WITH ME CAMBER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. I THINK YOU. THANK YOU. THANKS HI MY NAME IS KAREN BURN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND THE NINETY EIGHT OR CITIES AROUND THE STATE. SAID OF THE INTERSECTION CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE DOING LOCAL WORK ON STATEWIDE MISSIONS. AND WHERE I'VE REALLY EXCITED THAT WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE TODAY A WHEN I DO TALK TO MY MEMBER DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE THIS IS ONE OF THEIR NUMBER ONE CONCERNS IF NOT THEIR NUMBER ONE CONCERN. AND. AS YOU KNOW I WILD FIRES A CRITICAL RESOURCE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE AND THERE'S A REALLY SIGNIFICANT LOCAL AND ASPECT TO THIS THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH LOCAL GROUPS LIKE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND OTHER FOLKS WORKING AT THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND SO WE FEEL LIKE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF THIS WORK TO REMAIN LOCAL HOWEVER WHEN WE DO FACE AND. THE CHALLENGES OF I'M HAVING TO IS AS. YOU REFERENCE BEING ABLE TO AND. A CASH FLOW THE STATE ON THESE PROJECTS WE CAN SOMETIMES GO AS MUCH AS I ONE TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS I THAT WERE CASH FLOWING FOR THE STATE. AND THAT PURSUIT CREATES A REALLY SERIOUS HARDSHIP. FOR THE LOCAL CONSERVATION DISTRICTS IN FOR THE OTHER FOLKS THAT THEY TAKE ON THIS MONEY. AND WE THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH THE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS DO WITH HOW LITTLE MONEY THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT'S ALWAYS KIND OF AMAZING TO ME. I YOU KNOW REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE IS THAT WE RECENTLY RECEIVED AT THE TAHOE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT. RECENTLY RECEIVED A FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A SMALL. AS STRATEGIC PLANNING GRANT AND TURNED THAT INTO A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR EASEMENTS IN WHICH THEY'RE GONNA DO ALL THE RESTORATION PROJECTS ON JUST THAT FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE TYING UP. YOU KNOW ONE TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF THEIR ASSETS WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IS THAT. THE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AREN'T ABLE TO DO THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY'RE CHARGED WITH DOING NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IF THEY DO DO THAT WORK THEY OFTENTIMES HAVE TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE MEANS OF PAYING FOR IT WHICH MIGHT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE CONTRACTORS IN A TIMELY WAY WHICH THAT HURTS LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND LASTLY THERE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS REALLY TO TAKE ON AND LOANS WHICH THEN RUN THEM ANOTHER INTEREST RATE THAT GOES ON TOP OF THAT. AND WHEN THEY'RE ONLY BEING PAID SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO PERCENT AND FIFTEEN PERCENT OF OVERHEAD YOU OUT OF THREE FOUR FIVE PERCENT LOAN ON TO THAT AND IT MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET THE WORK DONE. SO THIS ISSUE IS SO CRITICAL TO LOCAL CONSERVATION AND SO CRITICAL TO THE WORK THAT WE ALL DO LOCALLY THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL COMING FORWARD. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS BILL DOES ENJOY A SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.
