WITH SUPPRESSED CODED TRANSMISSIONS THE LOWEST POSITIVITY RATE IN THE NATION AND A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF VACCINATED RESIDENTS WE ARE SEEING GREAT PROGRESS STILL OUR WORK IS FAR FROM DONE COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND OTHER DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES REQUIRE OUR CONTINUED FOCUS. AND ATTENTION. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE A SECTOR OF THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY THAT'S WORKING TO SERVE THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND THAT HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO HELP OUR STAKE IT THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND THAT'S OUR HOSPITALS. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO OVER FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS WHICH TOGETHER PROVIDED CARE TO OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS WITH COPD AT NINETEEN. PATIENTS THAT WERE OFTEN THE SICKEST AND MOST VULNERABLE. FACED WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE OUR HOSPITALS ROSE TO THE OCCASION. THEY SUSPENDED NON ESSENTIAL PROCEDURES THEY ACQUIRED MASS QUANTITIES OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. I HARD TO DIGITAL STAFF AND ESTABLISH NEW WAYS TO MOVE IN CARE FOR PATIENTS. THEY ADDED NEGATIVE PRESSURE ROOMS TO ISOLATE COBIT PATIENTS. THEY CONSTRUCTED TEMPORARY STRUCTURES AND PARKING LOTS AND CAFETERIAS THEY LEAST CLOSED HOSPITALS% CONVENTION CENTERS AND SPORTS ARENAS. CREATED EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTERS AND SO MUCH MORE. AND BECAUSE THE LIFE DID NOT PAUSE HOSPITALS KEPT THEIR DOORS IN THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS OPEN TO CARE FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM HEART ATTACKS. SERIOUS INJURIES AND OTHER CRITICAL ILLNESSES. HOSPITAL STAFF AND THEIR ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAD CONCERNS FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR OWN FAMILIES. THEY STILL SHOWED UP FOR US.

OF THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE EXPERIENCED AND SO I RISE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION AND THOSE OF MY CONSTITUENTS. FOR OUR WONDERFUL HOSPITALS FOR THE EXECUTIVES FOR THE DOCTORS AND NURSES IN THE WONDERFUL STAFF THAT HAVE STEPPED INTO THE FRONT LINES- IN SUCH A AMAZING INTO ROADWAYS.

SENATOR DODD HERE'S TO BE READY SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL FIVE FIFTY SIX BY SENATOR DODD AND ACTUALLY DID COMMUNICATIONS CENTER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS SP FIVE FIVE SIX WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA INTO CONFORMANCE ITH EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SEEKING TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. DEMAND FOR RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER THAN IT IS TODAY. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS ONLY ELEVATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH BROADBAND ACCESS ACCESS SKEWS ME HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL FOR PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY IN EVERY ASPECT OF MODERN SOCIETY. YET TO MANY HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE STATE CAN'T EVEN ACCESS BROADBAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT AVAILABLE OR THE SIGNAL WHERE THEY LIVE IS SO WEAK. AS LEARNING HAS SHIFTED ONLINE STUDENTS STRUGGLED TO KEEP MAY STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP ADULTS AND COMMUNITIES WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS MAY NOT ABLE TO BE ABLE TO SEARCH OR APPLY FOR JOBS. WORK REMOTELY START BUSINESSES OR ACCESS EDUCATIONAL SOCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED TO THRIVE IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. THAT'S THREE FIVE FIVE SIX WILL ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS BY CONFORMING CALIFORNIA LAW WITH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FCC FEDERAL REGULATION IN ORDER TO EXPAND F. G. FIVE G. EXCUSE ME FIVE G. DEPLOYMENT AND CONTRIBUTE TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THIS BILL REQUIRES LOCALITIES TO GIVE ACCESS TO THEIR STREET LIGHTS AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES IN ORDER FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO ATTACH THEIR WIRELESS FACILITIES. THE BILL FOCUSES ON ENSURING THAT ACCESS TO THESE POLLS IS PROVIDED AT A NON DISCRIMINATORY COST BASED RATES. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE FCC ISSUED AN INFRASTRUCTURE ORDER THAT REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE A COST BASED RATE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO ATTACH THESE FACILITIES. HOWEVER MANY LOCALITIES ARE INTERPRETING THE INTERPRETING THE FEDERAL ORDER INCONSISTENTLY. THERE'S BEEN WIDESPREAD RESISTANCE NON COMPLIANCE IN CONTINUING LITIGATION OVER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ORDER. GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE AMONG STAKEHOLDERS IN MY TEAM. WELL I'VE TAKEN A MA'AM IT'S ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS THE LEAGUE OF CITIES SUCH AS ATHLETICS AESTHETIC STANDARDS AND SAFETY AND TIMING I KNOW THERE'S MORE TO WORK ON SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA OF EQUITY ISSUES. IN A DEAL FOR ME WE ARE WORKING WITH THE LEAGUE- AND SEEING THEIR OPPOSITION AT THE VERY BEGINNING ON THIS BILL WHICH WAS SO. EXPANSIVE IN TODAY I TALKED TO HIM YESTERDAY THE BIG ISSUES WERE EQUITY MAKING SURE THE COMMUNITIES REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THIS. BROADBAND AS ANYBODY ELSE IN WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES AND I PLEDGE TO WORK MY TAIL OFF AS THIS THING GOES FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT GETS THAT THOSE ISSUES GET TAKEN CARE OF IN IN IN THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE ON THIS CRITICALLY. NEEDED LEGISLATION THANK YOU SENATOR DODD- MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE WILL RECOGNIZE. SENATOR HERTZBERG FIRST. THINGS PRESIDENT JUST VERY BRIEFLY. WE'RE GOING TO REVOLUTION AND THIS PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED AN EXTRAORDINARY WAY TO EXPRESS ITS IMPORTANCE WHETHER IT'S ACCESS FOR KIDS WHO STUDY IN. SCHOOLS AND THAT'S THE BACKBONE THE INTERNET THE BROADBAND FOR G. AND THIRTY OF THE STATE HAVE OUR HAD THE SUCH A WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE QUICKLY I AM SEEN THIS IN MIKE'S TRY A THE WORLD WERE CUT HAVE A DA IN THE END IT ON SPEED IN THE LIKE MY BROTHERS RETIRED FROM THE CARRIES OVER IN THAILAND HE TELLS ME HIS. BROADBAND IS FASTER THAN IT WAS HERE WHEN HE WAS HERE IN CALIFORNIA JUST SOME WEEKS AGO SO I JUST TELL YOU THAT I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS I'VE STOOD UP IN COMMITTEE BEFORE AND WILL STAND UP AGAIN WE NEED TO MODERNIZE OUR SYSTEM THE IMPACT THE ECONOMY IS EXTRAORDINARY IT IS TIME TO MOVE FORWARD AS FAST RELIABLE THANK YOU CENTERS PERSON- PAN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR WIENER CENTER PANEL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT CENTER SITE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SP FIVE FIVE SIX ONE THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM NAPA FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SMALL CELL CAN DEPLOYMENT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY IN MY DISTRICT AND I'M PROUD THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AND YET THIS PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED HIGHLIGHTED JUST HOW MUCH WE NEED THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN GET RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY. IT WAS A PHYSICIAN AND A PARENT I SEE HOW. MUCH WE'RE DEPENDING ON THIS NETWORK TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS AND WE NEED CONNECTIVE ANY UPDATE ON BOTH ENDS CONNECTIVITY DOES NOT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ON THE DOCTOR AND IT'S ON THE PATIENT AND- WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS DON'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY- THOSE PATIENTS CANNOT GET. FAIR AND THEN THINK ABOUT ALL THE KIDS WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON DISTANCE LEARNING- AND AS AN OPTION AS WELL. AND THEN OF COURSE- DURING COVE AND WE'VE SEEN HOW. AT LEAST FOR SOME JOBS- HOW WE CAN TRY TO ALSO DO MORE DISTANCE WORK AS WELL REMOTE WORKING. AND CERTAINLY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL. SO IT'S SO VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE BUILD OUT. THIS NETWORK THAT WE HAVE IN THIS DISCUSSION WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO REMEMBER HOW CRITICAL THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS TO- PROVIDING. HEALTHCARE LEARNING AND WORK. AND SO- BELLS. I THINK THAT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE BE BUILT OUT THAT WE HAVE CONSISTENT. RULES FOR THAT- AND- CERTAINLY- WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CARING THIS BILL BECAUSE WE CAN'T WE CAN'T JUST KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS- WE NEED TO MAKE AN ACTIVITY A REALITY. AND THIS BILL SIMPLY CODIFIES FCC REGULATIONS TO BE SO WE CAN BE MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT FILLING IN THE DIGITAL DESERT'S AND MAKING SURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS. TO THIS. ESPECIALLY BASIC NEEDS THAT WE NOW HAVE IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY I- TONIGHT THANK. YOU THANK YOU SIR PAN SENATOR WIENER. OKAY YOU MR ROSE I RISE IN SUPPORT. OF SB FIVE FIVE- SIX. ONE THANK YOU- THE AUTHOR FOR BEING WILLING TO WORK- WITH STAKEHOLDERS- I THINK AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM COLLEAGUES ON THE NEED FOR FASTER ACCESS BECOMES MORE MORE. NOT JUST IMPORTANT BUT ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION IN MODERN DAY LIFE- AND THE PANDEMIC ONLY. MAGNIFIED THAT NEED BUT EVEN AFTER THE KIND OF AMERICA THAT NEED IS STILL. WITH US. AND THE REALITY IS THAT IT IS FRANKLY EMBARRASSING IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE STATE- HELLO. HELLO THE POOR INTERNET ACCESS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE. HAVE WHEN YOU COMPARE INTERNET SPEEDS IN THIS COUNTRY TO OTHER COUNTRIES. IT'S EMBARRASSING- AND THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR CITIES AND RURAL CALIFORNIA- AND OTHER AREAS THAT LACK GOOD ACCESS AND SO WE NEED. THIS INFRASTRUCTURE- AND UNFORTUNATELY I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND I SPENT YOU KNOW A LOT OF MANY MANY HOURS. LISTENING TO APPEALS OF THIS OF THE SIGHTING OF CELL. TOWERS I KNOW OTHERS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO WERE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THIS BODY. HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE- AND UNFORTUNATELY JUST GOT SO TIED UP- IN IN A NEIGHBORHOOD POLITICS THAT WE NEED A STREAMLINED. APPROACH AND I THINK THAT THIS HELPS- TO PROVIDE THAT- AS WITH- THE SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO'S BILL A% FEW YEARS AGO WHICH IS A BROADER VERSION OF THE SPELL FRANKLY- THIS BILL CONTINUES IN THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO ME. BACK A FEW YEARS AGO AND IS IMPORTANT NOW CONTINUES TO PROVIDE CITIES. WITH FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF DESIGN STANDARDS- AND IN TERMS OF THIS PRECISE CITING. SO THAT IF THE CITY BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE A QUICK NOD IN THIS AREA BUT ACROSS THE STREET OR THIRTY FEET AWAY THIS IS TOO CLOSE TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE. BUT SARAH. THE CITY. STILL HAS THE FLEXIBILITY. I FOR THAT'S- CITING PLUS THE DESIGN STANDARDS SO I THINK IT'S A BILL WORTHY OF SUPPORT. I DO WANT TO SAY THIS IS ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IN TERMS OF. ENHANCING THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WE ARE BEHIND ON AND WE NEED TO CATCH UP- BUT IT'S NOT THE WHOLE SOLUTION WE SAID WE NEED MORE COMPETITION. BYE IN TERMS OF INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE STILL TOO MANY PARTS OF THE STATE. WHERE THAT PEOPLE AFFECTED WE HAVE ONLY ONE OPTION OR MAYBE TWO- AND THERE ARE SMALLER START UPS THAT WANT TO PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS THAT FRANKLY. PROVIDE BETTER AND FASTER INTERNET ACCESS BUT THEY ARE BLOCKED FROM EVEN ENTERING THE MARKET SO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL BUT THIS IS A GOOD STEP AND I SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER CENTER DRAWS A. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I'M REALLY GLAD THAT THE AUTHOR- TOOK UP THE ISSUE OF- EQUITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES I AGREE WITH STREAMLINING I AGREE WITH MOVING FORWARD I AGREE WITH MODERNIZING THOSE ARE ALL GREAT CONCEPTS BECAUSE IN A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS IT'S A CONCEPT THEY HAVE NO CONNECTIVITY. IN LOS ANGELES IS ONE EXAMPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS HAD NO CONNECTIVITY. NOT EVEN NUMBER OF PRODUCTIVITY THAT YOU SHOULD MODERNIZE WE SHOULD GET A YOU KNOW A SPEED HIGHER SPEED THAT HAD NO CONNECTIVITY. SO HOW DO WE REALLY LIVE UP TO THE THESE TERMS THAT WERE USING THE MODERNIZING AND MOVING FORWARD WELL WE ARE EXCLUDING. WE ARE EXCLUDING ENTIRE COMMUNITIES FROM HAVING THE BASIC CONNECTIVITY ARE YOU KNOW THE TERMS ARE USED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IT DOESN'T MEAN-ANYTHING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT YOU KNOW I REALLY GO TO TOWN ON THE AUTHOR- TO LIVE UP TO THIS COMMITMENT- BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THERE IS A STATEWIDE- OF THE SYSTEM OR WE WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT IT'S LEVEL STATEWIDE AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO STREAMLINE BUT IN SOME WAYS WE ARE TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO. PRESS FURTHER TO MAKE SURE THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE INCLUDED SO AGAIN I'M COUNTING ON THE AUTHOR TO MOVE THIS AND WHEN HE SAYS MOVE FORWARD THAT THAT MEANS EVERYBODY ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS A SENATOR RUBIO FOLLOWED BY SENATOR GROVE SENATOR RUBIO. I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I ALSO AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD. I YOU KNOW I MEAN TO- ONE ONLINE MY COMMENTS WITH ALL OF THE COMMENTS ALREADY STATED BUT IN PARTICULAR YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE NEED RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY IS NOW A MUST IS NO LONGER A LUXURY- I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOW THE COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES THAT. THE EQUITY PIECE IS STILL SOMEWHAT MISSING BUT I'M VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS THAT HE CONTINUES TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL VOICES ARE HEARD AND HE CONTINUES TO MAKE THIS MEASURE EVEN BETTER. SO I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT HE'LL GET THERE ARE BUT I DO WANT TO JUST SHARE THAT YOU KNOW I ALSO COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ONE POSING THIS MEASURE ON THE BASIS THAT I DO BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL. NONE THE LESS- AS THE DOCTOR STATED WE- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN EVOLUTION AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT WE MOVE FORWARD CONSIDERING THAT YOU KNOW THIRTY ONE OTHER STATES ARE ALREADY THERE. IT'S TIME THAT WE ALSO CATCH UP AND DIE IN GENERAL WE'VE LEARNED NOT TO THIS PANDEMIC IT'S BECOME A NECESSITY IN OUR JOBS IN OUR HOMES AND EDUCATION AND THE DISPARITY STILL THERE AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE. THE EQUITY PIECES. THERE AND THAT WE ALSO CAN YOU TOO AND THAT LOW CAN. IS THERE AND SO I DO KNOW THAT THIS HOUSE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF. DESIGN STANDARDS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IT ALSO HAS- FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF LOCATION AND I KNOW THAT IT WILL BECOME A BETTER MEASURE AS IT WAS FOR SO I ALSO STAND IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I TOO- RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FIVE SIX EIGHT WHICH WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE. NON DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO LOCALLY- OWN STREET LIGHTS POLES AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES. WHAT I MEAN BY NON DISCRIMINATORY AS ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALREADY ALLOW UTILITIES TO BE ON THESE POLLS SO MINE AT THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN EXTEND BROADBAND. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT REALLY- KIND OF FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS DURING COVERT WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT SERVICE AVAILABLE. AT THE EQUIPMENT IS ALREADY BEING USED FOR UTILITIES LIKE I SAID THERE'S ALSO A SAFE HARBOR IN THE BILL WHERE THE- LOCAL. GOVERNMENT CAN CHARGE MORE BUT THERE'S A SAFE HARBOR OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS PER- PULL FOR THEM TO MOUNT THAT EQUIPMENT. IN THE PAST YEAR WE'VE SEEN A GREAT NEED. FOR ACCESS TO BROADBAND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING. WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CITIES AND TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT BRINGS ALMOST EVERY CITY OFF OF THIS BILL AND I THANK HIM FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT SPECIFICALLY MAKES MY CITIES- FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE. IN THEIR LOCAL CONTROL OPTIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE CENTER WAY SO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EQUITY ON THIS- MEASURE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW. A LOT OF US WANT TO SEE EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY EVERYONE IN THE STATE WE COVERED AND YOU HAVE ACCESS TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNET SERVICE. AND IT AND IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO A LITTLE BIT WHY AND WHY THIS BILL. WOULD MAKE THE PROCESS BETTER. AND BECAUSE I'VE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS THROUGH OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SIDE OF MY COMMITTEE FOR MANY YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN PUSHING. FUNDS THAT HELP. CREATE ACCESS TO BUT BY BRINGING BRINGING MORE ANTENNAS TO COMMUNITIES ARE NORMALLY. UNDER SERVED SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU HAVE A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY THAT'S VERY LOW INCOME. TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN OUR COUNTRY ARE PRIVATE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE PUBLIC RUN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALL THE POLLS INFRASTRUCTURE. IS OWNED PRIVATELY. AND THEY HAVE DECIDED WHERE THEY WANT TO PROVIDE SERVICE- JUST BY THE- REGULAR MARKET DEMAND PROCESS. AND OVER THE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE COME IN TO TRY TO GET THEM TO GO INTO AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T WANT TO GO BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY TO BE MADE IN FACT THEY MIGHT EVEN LOSE MONEY. THEY GO INTO THOSE AREAS SO WE HAVE. CREATED A SYSTEM WHERE WE SUBSIDIZE THE PLACEMENT OF ANTENNAS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS SO THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN GET ACCESS. EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE FULL COST OF THE SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED. UNDER UNDER THIS BILL AND UNDER PREVIOUS ACTIONS WE'VE TRIED TO FIND WAYS TO. DEMOCRATIZE OR THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE BUT ALSO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND TRY TO ENCOURAGE THESE COMPANIES TO GO OUT TO THOSE AREAS HAS BEEN VERY HARD. OFTEN TIMES WE HAVE HEARD STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE IN CERTAIN AREAS NOT HAVING ACCESS. AND AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY DO HAVE ACCESS BUT THEY JUST THEY'RE JUST NOT CONNECTED AND WE HAVE PROGRAMS TO CONNECT THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY KNEW THESE PROGRAMS EXISTED. SO THERE'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH THIS BILL. WE WILL TRY TO REGULATE WITH THIS BUT WE'LL TRY TO REGULAR PRICE- THE WAY WE DELIVER SERVICE AROUND THE STATE. AND I CAN GIVE SOME EXAMPLES FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME MARKETS THAT HAVE A LOT OF SUBSCRIPTION. THEY'RE CHARGING UP TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND PER ANTENNA PER MONTH. AND SOME HAVE LAUNCHED A SUBSCRIPTION THEY'RE CHARGING. SOMETIMES SEVENTY TO A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ANTENNA AND THIS IS WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GET. THIS IS WHAT ALL REPAIRS AND A PAIN SO IF YOUR REPAIR IN FRESNO OR IMPERIAL COUNTIES OR IN VERY UNDERSERVED AREAS. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE BEING CHARGED BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BEING PAID. IN THE IN THE AREAS LIKE LA AND SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY. WHERE TEY'RE GETTING MORE MONEY PER UN TENA. AND OFTEN TIMES THAT IS NOT FAIR AND IT ADDS COST TO THESYSTEM AND ARE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND THOSE FUNDS ARE COLLECTED BY CITIES DO NOT GO TOWARD MAKING. THIS UP MORE ACCESSIBLE TO UNDERSERVED AREAS YET THE STATE DOES HAVE PROGRAMS. AND WE HAVE A PROGRAM SET. BY BY VIRTUE OF A STATE LAW. THAT MAKE THESE THESE- FACILITIES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SO THE STATE IS REALLY DOING THE BRUNT OF THE WORK OF MAKING SURE LOW LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. ARE ARE GETTING ACCESS THE LOCALS ARE NOT AT ALL YET THE LOCALS ARE GETTING PAID FOR THE ANTENNAS THE STATE IS NOT. N. AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO CORRECT IF WE ARE REALLY CHAMPIONING THE CAUSE. OF THE UNDERSERVED AND WE WANT TO CREATE AN EQUITABLE SYSTEM AND WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES GET ACCESS WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY. TO REGULARIZE THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING PAID MORE THAN THAN THAN THAN. POORER COMMUNITIES- THE AND IT KIND OF ADDS TO THE INEQUITY OF HOW WE HAVE VERY SOME VERY AFFLUENT POCKETS IN OUR IN OUR STATE AND SOME THAT ARE VERY POOR IT CONTINUES TO ADD TO THAT EQUITY WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE AUTHOR OF TAKING THIS BILL LAN. AND THE ALL THE ALL THE VARIOUS WORK THAT HAS COME OVER THE YEARS TO DO THIS BUT I ALSO WANT TO CURSE ALL OF YOU MEMBERS PLEASE WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE IN YOUR DISTRICTS AND PEOPLE NEED PHONES AND THEY NEED INTERNET WE HAVE INTERNET SERVICE TO THAT INCIDENT IN ALL COMMUNITIES OF STATE ESPECIALLY LOW IN COMMUNITIES. WHERE FAMILIES CAN BE IT'S TEN DOLLARS A MONTH FOR INTERNET SERVICE THEIR SPECIAL PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THE REAL EVEN GIVE FAMILIES A FREE PHONE FREE PHONE SERVICE LOW THE INTERNET SERVICE SOME SOME CASES IT'S POSSIBLE TO SET P A FREE SERVICE IN CERTAIN POCKETS. AND I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND MOVE FORWARD TO IMPROVING THE DELIVERY SERVICE ALSO GET INFORMED OF ALL THE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN OUR STATE. TO HELP LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES BECAUSE- IF WE PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS. MORE PEOPLE GET ACCESS WE'VE HAD. WE'VE HAD CLINIC WE'VE HAD THESE FARES IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE WE GO OUT THERE. AND INFORM PEOPLE D. THAT YOU QUALIFY FOR PHONE SERVICE AND INTERNET SERVICE AND PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED. THEY NEVER HAD A PHONE OR SERVICE AND ARE SHOCKED TO FIND THAT THEY QUALIFY FOR ONE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AVAILABLE. BUT UNSUBSCRIBED AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP FAMILIES AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO. WORK ON THAT AS- THE AS YOU DO ALL THE WONDERFUL WORK THAT YOU DO YOUR DISTRICTS TO INCLUDE THAT AS PART OF IT. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT FOR LET ME GO ON AND FOR THE AUTHOR FOR THE WORK THE STUFF ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO MEMBERS IS THERE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON SB FIVE FIFTY SIX. THE CENTER COPYRIGHT. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES A FEW WORDS AND I HAVE A STATEMENT AND THEN AT A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR FIRST I WANT TO SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM NOT BUT THE WORK THAT HE'S DONE AND THE AMENDMENT SAID HE'S TAKEN I THINK IS BILL HAS MOVED IN IN. A DIRECTION THAT IS THAT'S REALLY POSITIVE AND I WANT TO SAY FROM THE FROM THE GET GO THAT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT YOU KNOW PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS THAT THE FCC IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASICALLY HAVE PREEMPTED LOCAL THE STATE FROM REGULATING BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES AND THOUGH THEY GIVE US THE PARAMETERS AROUND HOW WE CAN. HOW WE CAN INTERACT WITH THE COMPANIES AND THEIR THEIR THEORY IS THAT THIS IS AN ENTERTAINMENT- FORUM AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THIS IS NO LONGER ENTERTAINMENT THIS IS A NECESSITY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S A NECESSITY FOR OUR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO GET AN EDUCATION IT'S A NECESSITY FOR US BECAUSE WE WERE SNT HOME AND WE HAD TO- ZOOM OUR MEETINGS FROM HOME AND IT'S A NECESSITY FOR A BUSINESS COMMUNITY BECAUSE FRANKLY MANY OF THEM WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED. BUT FOR INTERNET OPPORTUNITIES AND SO- IF THIS BILL WITHOUT QUESTION IS GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS AND AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS- I'M NERVOUS AND I AND IT WORRIES ME TO BE TAKING AWAY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL BECAUSE THE LAST TIME WE DID IT WE ENDED UP I THINK WITH PORTER CABLE SERVICE- AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT DO THAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET SOMETHING IN RETURN. AND SO WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO GET IN RETURN IS AN INSURANCE AND ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE BROADBAND ACCESS TO DISADVANTAGED AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN DIEGO ON IN MY COMMUNITY THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF PAYING- A GETTING A DISCOUNT ON YOUR INTERNET IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF BEING ABLE TO- TO GET THIS SIR. BUT IT'S NOT. WHAT WANT THERE IS JUST NO SERVICE PERIOD. AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO. PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PUT THESE SMALL CELLS AND TO BE ABLE TO TELL LOCAL GOVERNMENT OKAY YOU'VE GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO DETERMINE. WHETHER WHERE THEY'RE GONNA GO AND WHETHER THEY'RE APPROPRIATELY PLACED IN THERE. THEN I THINK WE GOT IT ABSOLUTELY DEMAND THAT WE START THE KIND OF COVERAGE WHICH IS HIGH SPEED. INTERNET AT A REASONABLE COST FOR RURAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT I WANT I WANT A COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHOR THAT THESE ARE. ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO HIM AND FRANKLY THAT FRANKLY THAT THEY'LL BE REFLECTED IN THE BILL. BUT THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT TERE ARE A NUMBER OF INTERNET BILLS AND I HAVE A FEELING THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT. THE PIECES TOGETHER SO THAT WE GET EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED. BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS MOVING TODAY THAT'S THE KIND OF COMMITMENT I NEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR COVER CONSIDER COVER YOU OPENED WITH US SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION DID YOU WANT TO ASK A DIRECT QUESTION OR WOULD YOU PREFER FOR THE AUTHOR JUST ADDRESS SO HE CAN HE CAN ADDRESS IT IN THIS BECAUSE I'M OKAY WITH THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR HOW YOU'RE APPRECIATE THAT- ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS SIDE OF MEMBERS ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING NONE SENATOR DODD WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THAT MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ON THE FLOOR- I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THIS ISSUE OF EQUITY TALK TO THE SENATOR FROM A LOS ANGELES ABOUT THAT IN THE COMMENTS AND EVERYTHING REFLECTIVE OF THE SENATOR FROM SALINAS ARE SPOT ON I MIGHT ADD THAT- AS I SAID I THINK IN IN IN MY FLOOR SPEECH. THAT WE WILL I DON'T THINK A LOT OF THE CITIES HAVE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON EQUITY ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO CELL SERVICE THE ISSUES OF MOSTLY BAD WHAT ARE YOU GONNA PAY ME FOR IT. YEAH WHAT IS THAT YEAH HOW ARE YOU GONNA HANG THIS ON THE PULL OF THE AESTHETICS ALL THOSE THINGS. AND THE LAST TME THIS BILL WAS HERE THOSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THIS WAS ADDRESSED WELL ENOUGH SO THAT'S WHAT WE FOCUS MOST. IF NOT ALL OF OUR TIME ON KIND OF GETTING TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY MY COMMITMENT IS HOLY TO. REALLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN THIS BILL- I HAVE NOT EVEN HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMUNICATION AMONG THE CLEAR- ON THAT TODAY TO DATE. BUT THIS IS NOT- AT ISSUE JUST FOR SALINAS OR LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S FOR NAPA AND FAIRFIELD AND VACAVILLE AND ALL THE KIDS WOULD LINE AND ALL THE COMMUNITIES.

THIRTY FIVE LOOKS LIKE CENTER GROVE'S READY SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE RESOLUTION THIRTY FIVE BY SENATOR GROWTH RELATIVE TO CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SR THIRTY FIVE COMMEMORATES MAY FIFTEENTH AS PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY. MAY FIFTEENTH IS A COMBINATION OF A WEEK OF REMEMBRANCE AND FELLOWSHIP EVENTS HONORING THE LIVES OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO DIED IN SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT ONLY RECOGNISE BUT UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITIES HAZARDS AND IMMENSE SACRIFICES LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BEAR EACH AND EVERY DAY. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE LEVEL ONES THAT HAVE GUIDED ENCOURAGED AND SUPPORTED THEM ALONG THE WAY. TODAY OUR POLICE OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS FACE A GREAT AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY THEY'RE SUBJECT% TO MATCH GREEN TEA AND CONDEMNATION YET THEY CONTINUE TO PROTECT AND UPHOLD THE LAWS THAT BENEFIT ALL INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE AGAINST THEM. IN A SINGLE DAY AN OFFICER MAY RESPOND TO CALLS FOR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT DEADLY CAR ACCIDENTS OR A PERSON ON TOP OF THE BRIDGE CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE. WHEN AN OFFICER RESPONDS TO A CALL PULL SOMEONE OVER KNOCKS ON THE DOOR OR ENTERS A SCENE. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SCENARIO AWAITS THEM. AND THEY MUST BE READY AT ALL TIMES TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES THE DUTIES OF A POLICE OFFICER ARE ARD TO DEFINE WITH SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY IN THEIR DAY NOT ONE DAY IS THE SAME AS THE NEXT. FROM TIME TO TIME THEY PUT THEIR UNIFORM ON AND THEY LEAVE THEIR HOMES THEY HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RETURN HOME TO THEIR FAMILY THAT EVENING. THEY WORK WEEKENDS CHRISTMASES AND MOST ALL HOLIDAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ENJOY SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITY. OUR COMMUNITY HOLDS POLICE OFFICERS AT A HIGHER STANDARD AT ALL TIMES EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY TAKE THEIR UNIFORM IN THEIR BADGE OFF AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN RETURNING HOME. THE DUTY TO SERVE IS NEVER LAID TO REST. OUR PEACE OFFICERS HAVE A JOB SECOND IN IMPORTANCE TO NINE AND IT'S A JOB THAT IS DIFFICULT AS DANGEROUS AND DANGEROUS AS IT IS IMPORTANT. OUR CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE WORKED DUTIFULLY AND SELFLESSLY ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF THE PERIL AND THE HAZARD TO THEMSELVES. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THEIR SACRIFICE. WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WITHIN OUR POWER TO HONOR THEMEMORY AND THE LEGACY OF OUR FALLEN OFFICERS. WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS REMEMBER THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR OUR SAFETY. AND EXPRESS EXPRESS APPRECIATION TO THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO MAKING CALIFORNIA SAFER PLACE TO LIVE AND RAISE THEIR FAMILIES. WE THINK THE POLICE OFFICERS AND OUR PEACE OFFICERS WHO SERVE TODAY AND THOSE WHO DIED GIVING THEIR ALL AND DIED DURING THE SERVICE OF THEIR COMMUNITY. ON MONDAY SHERIFF MIKE BOUDREAUX TULARE COUNTY INVITED ME TO BE THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE SHERIFF MY CELL AND THE CHIEF OF THE TO TELERI COUNTY ARE SKEWED ME TO LEARN POLICE TO. ALSO SPOKE AND WE STOOD BEFORE A MARBLE WALL THAT ON THAT WALL AXED FROM EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE TO TWENTY TWENTY WERE NAMES OF OFFICERS THAT HAD LOST THEIR LIFE. THE TWO OFFICERS THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY HONORED ALL WERE HONORED AND REMEMBERED BUT THE TWO SPECIFICALLY THAT LOST THEIR LIVES IN TWENTY TWENTY. WERE FLANKED FRANKLIN LUTHER ARNOLD. FROM THE OFFICE OF PROTECTIVE SERVICES INTO WATCH DATE WAS JANUARY TWENTY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND DEPUTY FRANK G. HOLD DEAN THE THIRD. TELERI COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT INTO WATCH WAS JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BOTH OF THESE DISTINGUISHED OFFICERS THAT PROTECTED THAT COMMUNITY DIED OF COMPLICATIONS OF COPD NINETEEN.

JUSTICE YOU KNOW SO WOULD PULL OUT BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SIX ZERO SIX EIGHT. AND HE WOULD READ THAT CODE OUT LOUD AND REMIND THEN TOM GRAY GO IN SINCE OTHERS AND I HAVE. EMBARKED ON THAT PRACTICE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO REFERENCING JUSTICE. READ ALSO IN STREET. READ THE L. THE PROVISION OF THAT BECAUSE WHICH I READ HERE NOW. THE ONE SENTENCE THAT WAS PRETTY IN THAT HE EVERY NEW ALLOY. TO EXPRESS OB. IS BEING A LAWYER. AND THAT PROVIDES SECTION H. SAYS NEVER TO REJECT IT IS THE DUTY OF AN ATTORNEY TO DO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING EACH. NEVER TO BE CHECKED FOR ANY CONSIDERATION PERSONAL TO HIMSELF OR HERSELF THE CAUSE OF THE DEFENSELESS OR THE- PRESSED. AS HE TOOK AND GAVE THE OATH OF OFFICE TO EVERY NEW LAWYER HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH IN THIS HAD THAT SEED IN THEIR MIND. AND I TOOK THAT GUIDANCE FROM HIM AND HAVE DONE THE VERY SAME THING EACH TIME LITERALLY TWO WEEKS AGO IN HIS NAME I WANT TO ADJOURN HIS MEMORY HE IS A GREAT. GREAT GREAT CUT CONTRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA AND A GREAT HUMAN BEING. THANK YOU SIR HERS BERG SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I HAD THE DEEP HONOR OF WORKING WITHTHEM FOR JUST THREE NOW SO- BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE DURING A VERY VERY DIFFICULT PERIOD. WITH THE COURT UNDER SIEGE. THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY UNDER SIEGE- AND JUSTICE RIGHT NOW SO ALONG WITH HIS COLLEAGUES ON THE COURT- UNDER SERIOUS RECONFIRMATION. ELECTION AND EVEN DURING THE PRESSURES OF THAT MOMENT- HE EXUDED AT SUCH A CALMNESS OF HIS PLACE IN LIFE AND- IN CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE HAD. DONE EVERYTHING THE RIGHT WAY. AND THAT HE HAD FULFILLED HIS OBLIGATIONS WITH INTEGRITY. AND WITH INDEPENDENCE AND THAT THE POLITICAL WINDS OF THE DAY. DIDN'T DRIVE HIS INSISTENCE ON FOLLOWING HER JUSTICE WOULD LEAD. ONE OF THE- MANY UNTOLD STORIES OF THAT TIME- WAS AS ELECTION DAY APPROACHED. AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT HI CHIEF JUSTICE ROSE LIZABETH BIRD WAS NOT GOING TO BE CONFIRMED THAT SHE TOOK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM HER ACCOUNTS AND GAVE IT TO JUSTICE RIGHT NOW SO THAT HIS VOICE COULD STILL BE HEARD- AT THE END OF THAT VERY DIFFICULT. PROCESS HE WAS A TRAILBLAZER AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT BY HIS DEMEANOR. HE EXHIBITED SUCH HUMILITY AND THE WORK THAT HE WAS DOING. BUT HE WAS A PROFOUND. TRAILBLAZER FOR OUR STATE AND FOR SO MANY OF US WHO ADMIRED HIS SERVICE. AND HE WILL BE DEEPLY DEEPLY MESSED AND IT IS MY HOPE IS WE RECOGNIZE HIM AT HIS SERVICE THAT WE AS LEADERS IN THIS STATE CAN FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO RECOGNIZE SUCH GREAT. MEN AND WOMEN AS JUSTICE RIGHT NOW SO IN THE WORKINGS OF OUR STATE. HE IS DESERVING OF GREAT THE MEMORY THAT WE REFLECT ON HERE TODAY CAN CONTINUE ON WITH A RECOGNITION OF HIS NAME IN PLACES OF OUR WNDERFUL GOLDEN STATE. AND WITH THAT I. PAST THAT WE ADJOURN IT IS WONDERFUL MEMORIES.
