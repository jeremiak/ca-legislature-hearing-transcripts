EXPOSURE TO TOXIC AIR

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:07.037
CONTAMINANTS AND PROVIDING

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:08.539
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:11.275
COMPLYING WITH AIR POLLUTION-

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:12.676
AND LATER WE WERE GIVEN THE

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:15.045
TASK OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:18.516
EMISSIONS AS WELL SO. MANY WITH.

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:20.885
THE PARTS THAT HAVE PRODUCED OF

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:23.120
THE FIRST ONE THE CRITERIA. AIR

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:25.823
POLLUTANTS- LIST FOCUSES

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.058
PRIMARILY ON KNOCKS DOCTOR CHEN

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.994
OXIDES WHICH ARE THE MOST

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.563
IMPORTANT INGREDIENT OF SMALL

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.598
THAT WE WORK ON TO TRY TO.

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.601
PREVENT OZONE FORMATION AND- OF

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:40.871
NOT. NOT IS ALSO A AGREE GAS

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:43.007
WERE SO. TURNS OUT THAT OUR

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:45.242
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN- MOVING IN

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:48.179
THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR THAT AS

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:51.148
WELL. THE TERM HERE SHOWS A

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:53.417
PROGRESS SINCE TWO BUT REALLY

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.919
YOU COULD GO ACK TO THE

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:57.354
NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND SHOW-

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:59.390
CONTINUE WILL- A STEADY

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:01.826
DECREASE DUE TO MULTIPLE

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:03.427
REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:07.598
BEEN ADOPTED OVER TIME- BY CAR

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.533
OF COURSE AND ALSO- BY THE US

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.437
EPA AS WELL- THE MOBILE SOURCES

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:15.773
ARE. RESPONSIBLE FOR BY FAR THE

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.174
LARGEST SHARE OF KNOCKS

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:19.143
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.744
BECAUSE OF OUR- ENGINE

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:23.380
STANDARDS AS WELL AS OUR WORK

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:26.116
TO CLEAN UP FEELS AND TO- TURN

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.751
OVER THE FLEET WHICH IN RECENT

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.687
YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO.

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:32.890
QUITE A LOT THROUGH- INCENTIVE

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:35.359
FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED-

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.694
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TOXIC AIR

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.929
CONTAMINANTS IN THIS IS A SMALL

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:41.899
ISHE CHART BUT IT HAS SIX OF

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:44.668
THE- NASTY S. OF THE- ACCESS

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:47.638
THAT WE DEAL WITH- AGAIN IT'S A

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:51.342
IT'S A GOOD STORY GOOD PICTURE.

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:59.516
AND IT'S IS THE REALLY. A

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:00.618
PRIMARILY A RESULT OF CHAIN IN

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:02.853
THE FUELS AND THEN THE

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.255
EMISSIONS VIA. ALTHOUGH IN I

00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:05.522
FEEL THESE CASE WE ALSO HAVE

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.558
VERY SOURCE BUT REGULATIONS

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.760
WITH BURKE FLORA FLAME WHICH IS

00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:12.596
USED IN THE DRY. INDUSTRY

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:14.365
PRIMARILY SOUTH BUT IF YOU LOOK

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.833
AT DIESEL PARTICULATE WHICH IS

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.501
BY FAR THE MOST TOXIC AND IT'S

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:19.103
THE ONE OVER IN THE LOWER RIGHT

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:20.871
HAND CORNER THAT'S PROBABLY

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.806
BEEN FOCUS OF MORE OF OUR

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.475
EFFORTS IN RECENT YEARS.

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:28.078
BECAUSE THE EXPOSURE IS SO WIDE

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:31.649
SPREAD- THROUGHOUT COMMUNITIES.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:35.152
IN ALL OF THESE EFFORTS- NOW

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.955
WE'RE LOOKING TOWARDS THAT THE

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:40.090
OVER ARCHING IMPORTANCE OF

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:41.926
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SINCE

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.394
TWO THOUSAND SIX. HARVEST HAD

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.628
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:47.164
PREPARING SCOPINGPLANS AND FOR

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:49.333
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING- MOST OF

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.201
THE REGULATIONS THAT COME UNDER

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:54.104
THAT- UNDER THE SCOPING PLANTS

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.373
AND WE'RE- VERY PROUD OF THE

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.075
FACT THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE

00:42:58.142 --> 00:43:00.911
ACTUALLY ACHIEVED OUR TWENTY

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:02.579
TWENTY TARGET WHICH IS UNUSUAL

00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:03.514
TO HAVE EXCEEDED THAT OF

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.116
EXCEEDED OUR- REQUIREMENTS-

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:09.553
BUT- WE WERE- HELPED. A LOT BY

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.056
OTHER FORCES PARTICULARLY I

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:14.425
WOULD SAY- THAT TRANSITION OF

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:16.794
THE UTILITIES TO CLEANER

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.230
RENEWABLE LECTRICITY THE

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:21.265
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:22.399
WHICH IS THE ONE THAT WERE

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:25.269
OPERATING UNDER NOW-CONTINUES

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:27.071
THE APPROACH THAT WE HAD FROM

00:43:27.137 --> 00:43:29.673
THE BEGINNING. OF USING A MIX

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.841
OF DIFFERENT MEASURES INCLUDING

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:34.011
DIRECT REGULATIONS INCENTIVES

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:37.014
AND THE MARKET BASED MECHANISM

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.583
CALLED IN TO AID AS OF PUTTING

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.286
THOSE TOGETHER TRY TO WHICH IF.

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:45.356
BALANCE AND TO A GOALS AT THE-

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:47.124
AT THE LOWEST COST FOR

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:49.727
CALIFORNIANS OVERALL- IN

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.295
ADDITION TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:54.498
GAS EMISSIONS SEVERAL THE

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:57.034
STRATEGIES THE SCOPE AND

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:58.202
PLANTS. ARE ALSO A LOT THIS

00:43:58.268 --> 00:44:01.238
PART AFTER TO MEET NASH. BE AN

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:03.574
ERROR THE STATE STAND AT IN

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.744
WORDS FOR SEPT IN THE LOW. FUEL

CLEAN FUEL AND ENERGY AS WELL

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:15.052
AS THE IN CLEAN CAR PRO. WHICH

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.887
PUT MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION

CLEAN VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THE

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:22.159
SUSTAINABLE ACTION PLAN THAT IS

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.395
MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS ITS ACT

00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:26.163
IMPLEMENTATION THAT WILL RESULT

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.132
IN CLEANER SYSTEMS FOR MOVING

00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:33.937
GOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND.

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:36.774
OF COURSE WE HAVE THE AT FOR

NUMBER OF THESE ARE HAVE BEEN

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.115
MODIFIED ALONG THE WAY FOR TO

SAME TIME ASSURING COMMUNITIES

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:54.324
THAT ARE PROGRAMS- WILL DELIVER

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:57.528

00:44:57.594 --> 00:45:00.230
ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE CONTINUE

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:02.132
TO MONITOR ALL OF THESE

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:05.569
DEVELOPMENTS AND IN YOUR HAND

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:06.203
OUT YOU HAVE A LIST OF ALL THE

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.072
DIFFERENT- REPORTING AND

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:09.807
OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:11.508
PUBLIC AS WELL AS THE

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:13.477
LEGISLATURE TO SEE WHAT'S GOING

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.345
ON WITH THESE CLIMATE PROGRAMS

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:17.781
AND TO FOLLOW WHAT'S WHAT'S

00:45:17.848 --> 00:45:19.316
HAPPENING. THEY JUST WANT TO

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:21.018
SPEND A FEW MINUTES TALKING

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:23.454
ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.023
BECAUSE TRANSPORTATION IS FAR

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:31.161
AND AWAY THE MOST IMPORTANT.

00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:31.995
SOURCE OF BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS I

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:40.070
AM. MISSION SHE YOU THE SHARE

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:42.539
IT EACH OF THE FOR A OF THESE

00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:46.110
TYPES OF A AND IT'S TO CONTINUE

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:48.645
TO BE THE BEARER WHERE WE I WAS

00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:51.381
MOST OF A BECAUSE IT IS

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:54.718
DOMINATED BY- NOT ONLY OUR

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.220
PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION BUT

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:59.056
ALSO- THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:01.058
INCLUDING TRUCKS BUSES FREIGHT

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:03.160
EQUIPMENT LOCOMOTIVES MARINE

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:05.062
VESSELS AND OTHER OFF ROAD

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.930
EQUIPMENT SOME OF WHICH ARE

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:09.366
REALLY ONLY ATTAINABLE BY THE

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:10.701
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:13.370
HAS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:14.671
RAILROADS FOR EXAMPLE THAT

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:16.039
REMAIN ONE OF OUR MOST

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:18.675
DIFFICULT- PROBLEMS TO TRY TO

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:21.778
ADDRESS- AND BECAUSE DIESEL

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:24.381
PARTICULATE MATTER MAKES UP 30%

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.250
OF ALL THE PARTICULATE MATTER-

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:28.252
FROM- THE TRANSPORTATION

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:31.822
SECTOR. THIS IS- NOT A CRITERIA

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:34.458
POLLUTANT IT'S ONLY LISTED AS A

00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:36.693
TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT BUT WE

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.229
HAVE HAD- CONTINUAL

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:40.797
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.533
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE- THE

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:44.801
PIONEERING COMMUNITIES IN OUR

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:47.971
AB SIX SEVENTEEN AT PROGRAM AND

00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:49.940
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:51.742
COMMUNITIES AND A VERY CLEAR

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:55.379
VOICE THAT THEY WANT TO SEE US-

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:59.116
MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF ZERO

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:01.285
EMISSION VEHICLES A SOLUTION

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:03.053
NOT FOR GLOBAL WAR BUT FOR THE

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.056
GROUND LEVEL POLLUTION THAT THE

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:08.425
EXPERIENCE THERE IN THE IN. THE

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:11.995
INTERIM SALUTE THEM FOR ME

00:47:12.062 --> 00:47:14.865
TECHNOLOGIES THEY WILL TO SEE A

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:25.776
ARE THEY WANT TO SEE US MAP. SO

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:28.946
WITH THAT IN MY- HI I THINK

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:31.315
WHAT I TO SAY IS WE ARE HAVE TO

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:33.750
PURSUE SOME NEW AND MORE

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:34.718
AGGRESSIVE STRAY. THAT RAPIDLY

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:36.720
A IS THERE EMISSION TECHNO. AND

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:38.589
ALSO TO RE MOBY PATTERN TO RID

00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:40.224
THE ONE TRAVELED FOR AS LONG AS

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.226
WE CAN TO HAVE COMBUSTION THE

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.895
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THE

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.029
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:48.332
REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET OUR

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:50.701
SB THIRTY TWO CLIMATE CHART

00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:53.604
TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY AS WELL

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.673
AS- TO GET TO THAT CARBON

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.910
NEUTRALITY GOAL OF THE STATE IS

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:03.747
SET FOR TWENTY FOUR AND FIVE.

00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:06.750
SIX AT THAT LETTER BE REQUIRED

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:09.653
NOT THAT WE CAN GET. OUT

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.054
BUSINESS AT HE WAS SO. IN ORDER

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:13.056
TO GET THAT LOVE OF. WE'RE NEED

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:14.091
TO ASSURE THAT EVERYBODY AND

00:48:14.157 --> 00:48:15.993
CAL. HAS ACCESS TO ZERO

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.328
EMISSION VEHICLES IN ONE FORM

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.464
OR ANOTHER AS WELL AS

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.199
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THOSE AB

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:25.502
FUELS ROADS AND COMMUNICATIONS

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:26.870
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO WORK TO

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:29.006
BUILD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:30.607
THAT IMPROVE PEOPLE'S TRAVEL

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:33.176
CHOICES AND REDUCE THE VEHICLE

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:36.380
MILES TRAVELED OR VMT. WE'VE

00:48:36.446 --> 00:48:41.084
MADE PROGRESS AS MY CHARTS HAVE

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:47.491
SHOWED DESPITE THE LACK OF. IN

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:49.726
THE COMPLETE ACTION ON TRADE SO

00:48:49.793 --> 00:48:52.829
LIKE SHIPS. AND TRUCKS AND WELL

00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:54.364
AS THE END IN V. MY TRAVELED

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:56.033
WHICH MEANS TRANSIT EMISSIONS

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:58.001
ARE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE

00:48:58.068 --> 00:49:00.370
WRONG DIRECTION AND OUR JOB IS

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:01.972
GOTTEN HARDER BECAUSE OF THE

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:04.775
FEDERAL SAFE FOR ALL THAT- TOOK

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:07.277
AWAY CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY TO

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:09.713
REQUIRES ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.215
OR TO REGULATE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:15.152
EMISSIONS FROM- MOTOR VEHICLES.

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:16.420
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

00:49:16.486 --> 00:49:18.088
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'VE ALSO

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:21.258
BEEN SO WILLING TO RESTORE OUR

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:24.428
A RIGHT TO THE ACT- BUTEVEN

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:27.798
WITH FULL COOPERATION FROM THE

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.599
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:30.834
WE WOULD STILL NOT HAVE.

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:32.703
EVERYTHING WE NEED WE HAVE TO

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:35.372
DOUBLE DOWN ON TRANSPORTATION

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.374
AND STRIVE FOR A FUTURE WHERE

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:38.842
EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA CAN

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:42.846
ATTAIN THE KINDS OF- TOTALLY

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:46.717
EMISSIONS FREE- LIFE THAT. IS

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:48.518
WHAT IS WHAT IS NEEDED YOU

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:50.754
KNOW. I CAN'T HELP BUT SAY

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.390
THAT- IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:55.492
THAT CALIFORNIA'S AND WORKING

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.127
TO DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS AND

00:49:57.194 --> 00:49:58.195
DURING THAT TIME IT'S

00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:00.097
IMPRESSIVE WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:00.664
TO AND WE'RE LOOKING TO BUY

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:02.165
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:05.001
BECAUSE OF THAT. YES BUT IT

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:07.337
TOOK. FIFTY TO DO IT IN A WAY

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:10.273
THAT ALSO MAINTAINED ECONOMIC

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.310
GROWTH AND I'M AND WE'VE KNOWN

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:16.046
FOR ALMOST LOG THAT THE SAME

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:18.682
AMBITIONS WHICH ARE COST BY

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:22.085
BURNING UP. FEEL ARE ALSO WERE

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.087
IS BECAUSE THEY ARE TO WARM

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:25.455
THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT NEW

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:29.292
INFORMATION THATWE SOME SAVE

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:32.596
AND DEALT WITH. KING AND THEN

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:37.701
IN NUMBER OF SAM TO. CAN TO

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:41.304
WILL A- STILL MAINTAIN OUR PA%

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:44.007
GROWTH OUR ACTON GROWTH. AND

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:52.716
THOSE ARE. BUT. WE'RE NEVER

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:54.284
GOING TO REACH OUR GOAL OF THAT

00:50:54.351 --> 00:51:00.056
PACE. VACATION AND TECHNOLOGIES

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:02.826
THAT WE KNOW ARE ALWAYS WHAT'S

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.561
GOING TO BE NEEDED AND WE'RE

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:05.462
GONNA HAVE TO ENLIST THE

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:08.265
SUPPORT OF EVERYBODY WHO HAS A

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:10.634
ROLE- INCLUDING NOT ONLY THE

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.935
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:14.204
PRIVATE SECTOR BUT THE PUBLIC

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:15.872
AT LARGE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:17.607
IN PARTICULAR. WE ARE SEEING A

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:19.743
LOT OF ACTIVITY IN INTEREST IN

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:21.711
THOSE AREAS. TO ACHIEVE THIS

00:51:21.778 --> 00:51:24.314
NEW PARADIGM WE'RE GONNA NEED A

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:27.751
NUMBER OF NEW- TYPES OF

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:29.286
INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING

00:51:29.352 --> 00:51:31.955
WIDESPREAD ELECTRIFICATION WITH

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:34.391
A 100% OF A LECTERN PASSENGER

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:36.092
VEHICLE SALES BY TWENTY THIRTY

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:38.094
FIVE. AND A COMPLETE TURNOVER

00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:41.131
OF VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC BY

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:42.432
TWENTY FORTY FIVE THESE ARE

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:45.268
JUST WHAT THE MODEL SHOT WITH

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.604
SOME OF THE- ON A GOAL THAT WE-

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:48.505
MADE UP BECAUSE IT WE THINK

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:49.473
IT'S NOW TO. IT'S A GOAL THAT

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:51.374
MAY. OUR SHOWS ONLY WAY THINK

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:52.976
WE CAN MEET THE STANDARDS THAT

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.811
HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET. WE NEED

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.980
TO HAVE SUSTAINED INVESTMENTS

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:59.583
AND POLICIES THAT WE CAN-

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:03.019
MAINTAIN OVER TIME- AND WE

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:05.055
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE. VERY CLOSE

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.189
TO A TIPPING POINT FOR

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:08.191
COMMERCIALIZATION FOR ZERO

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:09.793
EMISSION VEHICLES IN A NUMBER

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.162
OF AREAS WHERE TECHNOLOGY COSTS

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:14.397
AND DECLINING AND AS

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:16.600
INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANDS WE ARE

00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:18.401
ALREADY WITH. ARE BEGINNING TO

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:20.837
SEE THE TRAJECTORY TO REACH

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:22.272
ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.307
SYSTEM BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE BUT

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:26.343
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK STILL

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:28.278
NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND IT SURE

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:29.746
THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CUT

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:32.549
ACROSS MULTIPLE MODES OF TRAVEL.

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:34.618
IT'S GOING TO. BE THAT A BIG

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:37.020
PART OF THE TASK BUT TECHNOLOGY

00:52:37.087 --> 00:52:39.990
ALONE IT'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH

00:52:40.056 --> 00:52:40.857
TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:42.726
GOING TO BE A LOT OF. INTERNAL

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:44.995
COMBUSTION ENGINES OUT THERE IN

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.062
SOME SOURCES WHERE THEY'RE

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:48.064
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO-

00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:50.166
TO REPLACE SO. INVESTING IN

00:52:50.233 --> 00:52:54.104
ALTERNATIVES- INCLUDING. GREAT

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.873
MUCH GREATER ACCESS TO TRANSIT

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.943
IS ALSO VERY CLEAN- COMPLETE

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.511
STREETS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:03.480
SUPPORTS A WALKING AND BIKING

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:05.181
AS WELL AS PROGRAMS TO REDUCE

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:07.050
THE NEED TO COMMUTE. ARE ALL

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:08.852
THINGS THAT THAT HAVE TO BE

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:10.287
DONE AND AGAIN PROVIDE A MORE

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:11.955
INTEGRATED DO SEND

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.423
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.125
PLANNING THAT INCREASES AT

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:17.761
THAT. I MEAN THAT WILL INCREASE

00:53:17.827 --> 00:53:18.261
THE RANGE OF AFFORDABLE

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:19.763
HOUSING. AND TRANSPORTATION

00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:22.632
OPTIONS THESE THINGS ARE

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:23.934
INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO EACH

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.769
OTHER AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:31.308
ASKING- COLLEAGUE. EVEN CLIMATE

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:32.842
ADVICE. KATE CORD TO TALK MORE

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:35.111
THAT IN A BIT BUT AT THE HEART

00:53:35.178 --> 00:53:37.347
OF A LOT OF THIS IT REMAINS THE

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:39.616
INEQUITIES THAT KEEP PEOPLE

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:42.319
FROM- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:44.754
NEWEST TECHNOLOGIES OR FROM A

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.156
FORTY HOUSING AND PLACES THAT'S

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:47.924
CLOSER TO WHERE THEY WORK AND

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:49.593
TOO- OTHER KINDS OF RESOURCES

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:51.795
THAT. YOU NEED AND SO PUTTING

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.997
IN PLACE HIGH QUALITY TRAVEL

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.899
AND HOUSING OPTIONS FOR ALL

00:53:55.966 --> 00:54:03.340
CALIFORNIANS WILL BE NECESSARY.

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:08.411
I FELT REALLY GOOD. SORRY OKAY

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:12.682
GOT IT- I AM A I MISIDENTIFIED

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:14.751
TWO WOULD BE SPEAKING FOR A OPR

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.920
ACTUALLY IS IT WILL BE RELEASED

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:19.823
BACK WORTH- SO I JUST WANT TO

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:21.224
QUICKLY SAY BECAUSE I KNOW

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:21.825
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE QUESTIONS

00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:23.293
FOR ME AND I THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.095
WORDS ON THESE PAGES THAT WITH

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:26.696
THE EASE THAT GO WITH THESE

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:29.165
LIGHTS- THAT AMONG THE THINGS

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:31.167
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITHIN

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:33.269
THE PURVIEW OF WHAT A RB IS

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:35.839
ALREADY. ABLE TO DO OR IS

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.941
REQUIRED TO DO INCLUDE

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:40.110
STRENGTHENING OUR GUIDELINES

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:42.512
FOR EVALUATING. THE OUT PLANS

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:44.414
THAT COMMUNITIES DEVELOP UNDER

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:47.150
SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE- THIS IS

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:49.653
GOING THROUGH THE- AND PO'S.

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:50.854
WE'RE DEVELOPING ARE CLEAN

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.390
MILES STANDARD REGULATION UNDER

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:55.659
SB TEN FOURTEEN WHICH IS

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.227
DESIGNED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:59.129
GAS EMISSIONS FROM RIDE HAILING

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:02.332
COMPANIES. LIKE UBER AND LEFT-

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:03.967
BY GETTING THEM INVOLVED IN

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:06.636
ELECTRIFICATION AND PULLING AND

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:08.772
OTHER MEASURES. AND WE ARE

00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:11.007
LOOKING OUT WHERE EVER WE HAVE

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:12.909
DISCRETION IN FUNDING. TO

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:14.210
INCREASE THE CLEAN

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:15.879
TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THAT ARE

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:18.114
AVAILABLE AND DISADVANTAGED CAN

00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:20.116
TODAY'S INCLUDING A NEW PILOT

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:22.318
PROJECT THIS YEAR. CALL THE

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:23.687
SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:26.656
EQUITY PROJECT OR STEP. THAT

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:27.991
WILL PROVIDE PLANNING AND

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:30.460
IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS. TO FUND

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:33.163
INTEGRATED LOW CARBON

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:34.297
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:37.333
ADDRESS COMMUNITY. NEEDS BUT-

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.436
CARP OBVIOUSLY CANNOT DO THIS

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:42.005
ON ITS OWN. IT WE HAVE TO BE OR

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:44.007
DATING ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:45.709
AND ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.877
WELL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:49.345
PARTICULAR ARE KEY TO

00:55:49.412 --> 00:55:52.615
INFLUENCING HOW COMMUNITIES ARE

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:53.316
BUILT AND WHAT TRANSPORTATION

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:56.486
OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. SO

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:59.556
LOOKING TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:01.191
REQUIRE THAT TRANSPORTATION

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:03.526
PROJECTS IN PLANS. WILL

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:04.961
DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY MEET

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.396
COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN WAYS THAT

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:10.366
REDUCE OVERALL NEEDS TO DROP

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:13.203
FIVE AND THE SENATE. HOUSING IN.

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:14.170
FILL YES THAT'S CLOSE TO

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:18.308
TRANSIT AND JOB UNDER. WELL AS

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:24.347
LOOK AT WAYS TO IMPROVE. THEIR.

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:31.087
ABILITY AS A AS A AS- AN- YEAH.

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:31.721
WE NEED TO LOOK WE EVEN BE ON

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:33.289
THE ACT THAT WERE TAKING NOW

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:34.758
TOWARDS THE GOAL OF CARBON NEW

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:36.459
AND THAT IS SO A STEP. WHAT

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:39.496
MOST OF OUR EXISTING PLANS AND

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:42.365
PROGRAMS HAVE THOUGHT TO DO-

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.334
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO STABILIZE

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.003
CLIMATE THE CARBON DIOXIDE AND

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.205
OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.673
THAT ARE GENERATED NOT JUST BY

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.108
VEHICLES BUT ALSO BY POWER

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:54.377
PLANTS INDUSTRIAL PROCESS SEES

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:57.747
AS WELL AS BY- ARE ARE NATURAL

00:56:57.814 --> 00:57:00.683
AND WORKING LANDS MUST BE LESS

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.952
THAN OR EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.954
CARBON DIOXIDE THAT IS REMOVED

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:07.423
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. THERE WAS

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.492
OUR SPECIAL REPORT ISSUED IN

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:11.628
LATE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY THE-

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:14.364
YOU AND I. P. C. C. PANEL

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:17.233
SHOWED THAT IN ORDER TO LIMIT

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.536
GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASES TO

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:22.572
ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.207
WE WOULD NEED TO ACHIEVE CARBON

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:26.309
NEUTRALITY GLOBALLY TO AVOID

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.811
THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:30.280
CHANGE I IT'S VERY SAY THAT FAR

00:57:30.346 --> 00:57:33.316
FROM. AND GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:36.152
MAY OTHER OF WORLD THE CALL

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:40.657
THESE KIND OF MAY NOW AS THOUGH

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:45.895
THEY BE OUT OF OUT OF REACH I

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:49.499
WE KNOW THAT WHEN IN CAL ARE

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:53.903
PULLED. DEMONSTRATE THE

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:56.306
AVAILABILITY OF AT. AND TO SHOW

00:57:56.372 --> 00:57:57.106
THEY CAN BE TO. IN WAYS THAT

00:57:57.173 --> 00:57:58.408
ARE. FOR AND ACTUALLY GENERATE

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:01.244
I CAN INVESTMENT THAT WE CAN

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.012
LEAD THE WAY AND GET OTHERS TO

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:05.181
JOIN WITH US IN THESE IN THESE

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:07.283
KINDS OF ACTIVITIES. I WANT TO

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.952
MENTION IN THAT REGARD A COUPLE

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:10.687
OF THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:11.955
WITH RESPECT TO CARBON CAPTURE

00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:14.290
AND SEQUESTRATION AS WELL AS

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:17.794
DIRECT AIR CAPTURE OF CO TWO

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:20.330
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THE

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:22.232
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ON

00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:23.867
NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AS

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:27.470
WELL- FIRST OUR BOARD ADOPTED A

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:30.206
PROTOCOL FOR USE IN THE LOW

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:31.975
CARBON FUEL STANDARD THAT IS

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:33.376
ALREADY BEGINNING TO ATTRACT

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:36.346
SOME ATTENTION FROM- INDUSTRIES

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.081
THAT ARE LOOKING TO.

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:39.048
DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE'S

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:42.886
TECHNOLOGY TO CAPTURE AND STORE

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.154
CARBON FROM- OIL REFINERY OR

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:47.390
CEMENT AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:50.426
FACILITIES. ARE THERE A NUMBER

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:52.695
OF VERY SMALL AT THAT MOMENT

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:58.067
PILOT PROJECTS. LOOKING AT RACK

00:58:58.134 --> 00:59:00.236
AIR TOP CO TWO BUT AGAIN THIS

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:00.870
TO BE A LAW OF WORK NEEDS TO BE

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:01.371
DONE TO MAKE THIS TECH.

00:59:01.437 --> 00:59:03.773
SCALABLE AND ECONOMIC WE NEED

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.441
TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF

00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:06.776
LOOKING AT THESE TECHNOLOGIES

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:09.145
AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN-

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:11.648
PIONEER SOME OF THEM. AND AGAIN

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:13.917
OUR NATURAL LANDS ALSO NEED TO

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:16.052
BE GIVEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:19.155
ATTENTION TO BECOME- THE KIND

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.691
OF CARBON SINKS THAT THEY NEED

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:23.426
TO BE THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:25.728
WE'VE BEEN. TALKING ABOUT AND

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:28.531
WORKING ON BUT AS YOU KNOW THE

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:30.500
ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE OBVIOUS

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:32.835
EFFECTS OF OUR AT CURRENT

00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:36.639
LEVELS OF- OF A BUILDUP OF

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:38.174
GREENHOUSE GASES HAS BEEN. THAT

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.476
WHERE MORE FIRE PRONE AND THAT

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:43.246
OUR FIRES ARE LARGER AND MORE

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:44.781
DESTRUCTIVE THAN THEY USED TO

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:47.984
BE- WE AT A R. B. HAVE SPENT A

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.752
LOT OF TIME. THINKING ABOUT A

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:51.621
LOOKING AT FIRE AND THE ROLE OF

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:53.690
CO TWO FROM BUYERS. AT ONE OF

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:55.725
THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECTS OF

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:58.161
FIRES IN NEAR ANY COMMUNITY

00:59:58.227 --> 00:59:59.829
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:01.364
DIRECTLY IN THE LINE OF THE

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.633
DESTRUCTION IS THE EFFECT OF

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.934
SMOKE AND WHAT IT DOES TO

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.502
PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO BREATHE.

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:10.707
IT'S SCARY AND IT'S AWFUL- WE

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.041
NEED TO FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.844
SAFELY ALLOW FOR BURNING ON

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.913
LANDS WHERE THE ONLY WAY TO

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.948
STORE THE HEALTH OF THE FOREST

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:21.584
IS TO ALLOW BURNING A PAST

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:22.885
COMBINED OTHER. BETTER

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:25.355
MANAGEMENT OF FIRES BUT I WANT

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:27.457
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:29.625
UNDERSTAND THAT LEVY A PART OF

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:32.695
OUR JOB IS BEING TO FIND WAYS

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.331
TO ALLOW FOR THERE TO BE. THE

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:37.066
KIND OF MEANING THAT THE TWO

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:40.003
BANDS CATASTROPHIC. WHAT FIRES

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.304
DURING THERE'S A LOT OF

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.806
INFORMATION IN THE HAND OUT

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.842
ABOUT FIRE I THINK I'M GOING TO

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:47.877
SKIP. READING THIS PART OF THE

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.579
TESTIMONY BECAUSE IT'S EASIER

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:51.881
FOR YOU TO READ IT FOR YOURSELF

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:55.585
THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANTED

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:59.455
TO TOUCH ON IN THIS THAT YOU

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:03.526
VAST. IS ISSUE OF ACCOUNTING.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.660
BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA WHERE

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:07.997
FRANKLY IS A IN THE WORLD- WHEN

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:11.100
IT COMES TO. HAVING A RIGOROUS

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.302
AND CREDIBLE SYSTEM FOR

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.371
ACCOUNTING FOR EMISSIONS AND

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:16.973
THAT IS THE BEDROCK UPON WHICH

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.908
ALL OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS NEED

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:20.943
TO REST BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.979
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY FOR

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.580
REGULATED INDUSTRY OR OTHER

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.682
STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.418
THAT THE REDUCTIONS THAT WERE

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:30.253
GENERATING BY OUR PROGRAMS ARE

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:33.022
REAL SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.758
FOR DECADES NOW TO USE SCIENCE.

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:38.161
TO PURSUE POLICIES AND PUT IN

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.063
THE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:41.964
OUR ACCOUNTING IS ACCURATE A

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:45.401
AND VERIFIABLE BOTH AB THIRTY

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:47.804
TWO AND SB THIRTY TWO FOCUSED

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.138
ON REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM THE

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.974
FOSSEL SECTOR AND THOSE

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.510
INVENTORIES ONLY INCLUDE ENERGY

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.579
TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRIAL

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:59.215
EMISSIONS WE AT CARP HAVE

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.950
SEPARATELY PUBLISHED A NATURAL

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:02.819
AND WORKING LANDS GREENHOUSE

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.687
GAS INVENTORY WHICH INCLUDES

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.589
THE WILDFIRE EMISSIONS THAT

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.391
ARE. DEPICTED ON THE SLIDES

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.793
THAT YOU HAVE BUT GREENHOUSE

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.662
GAS EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM A

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:15.832
NATURAL DISASTER LIKE WILD

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:19.001
FIRES SHOULD NOT BE MEASURED

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:22.438
OR- POOLED TOGETHER WITH

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.874
EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM- THE

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:27.343
SOURCES THAT ARE ANTHROPOGENIC

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.278
THAT WE CAUSE URSELVES NATURAL

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.647
DISASTERS THAT A BIT GREENHOUSE

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.516
GASES SUCH AS WILD FIRES AND

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.184
FOREST FIRES. HAVE BEEN

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:37.386
OCCURRING SINCE LONG BEFORE

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:40.189
CLIMATE CHANGE WAS NOTICED AND

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:41.757
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.793
CLIMATE CONTINUES TO CHANGE AND

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.862
WILL PERSIST EVEN IF WE WERE

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.730
ULTIMATELY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:49.999
OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO WHILE

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.901
SCIENCE CAN NOW CONCLUSIVELY

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:54.270
ATTRIBUTE INDIVIDUAL EXTREME

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:56.372
ADVANCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.708
DETERMINE WHAT TYPES OF EVENTS

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.209
ARE MADE WORSE BY CLIMATE

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:03.779
CHANGE SUCH AS HURRICANE SIX.

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:05.014
BOTH MARTIN TO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:07.116
SOME OF THESE OF ARE A SYMPTOM

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:09.552
OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ARE NOT

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:13.656
TO BE- INCLUDED- WHEN IT COMES

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:14.690
TO FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE GOING

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:16.526
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:18.327
OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS OF

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:19.829
CLIMATE SCIENTISTS IS THAT

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:22.899
CLIMATE CHANGE IS ANTHROPOGENIC

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.800
MEANING THAT WE HUMANS HAVE

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.002
BECAUSE THESE EIGHT

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:28.371
CONCENTRATIONS TO INCREASE AND

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:31.741
THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:33.743
FOR THE AVERAGE GLOBAL

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:36.112
TEMPERATURE INCREASES AND THE

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.713
MORE EXTREME VERSION OF EVENTS

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.716
THAT THIS CAUSES SEC SO. THIS

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.418
IS WHERE WE INTEND TO KEEP ON

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.754
PUTTING OUR ENERGY AND WHERE WE

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.755
THINK WE CAN MAKE THE BIGGEST

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:50.059
DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA SO- IN

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:52.428
CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO THANK YOU

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.963
FOR YOUR INTEREST AND

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.898
WILLINGNESS TO CONVENE OF ON

01:03:55.965 --> 01:04:00.937
THIS SECOND ANNUAL REPORT OF AB

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:03.372
ONE NINETY SEVEN AND- TO JUST

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.841
TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN THE

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:08.611
LEGISLATURE FIRST ADOPTED AB

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:11.113
THIRTY TWO AND TWO THOUSAND SIX

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.848
AS WELL AS THE RENEWABLE

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.884
ORTFOLIO STANDARD LEGISLATION.

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:16.586
THERE WERE WALKS PREDICTIONS

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:18.354
THAT THOSE GOALS WERE NOT

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.922
ACHIEVABLE AND THAT THEY WOULD

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:22.091
BE TO COST AND SEND THE FATE OF

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:25.261
THE WRONG DIRECTION NOW WE KNOW

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:30.132
I'M ONLY A FEW SHORT YEARS LATE.

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.934
THAT THOSE PROJECT THIS WRONG

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:32.535
THAT WE WERE RIGHT TO CONTRA.

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:35.871
IN THE ABILITY OF OUR OUR

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:38.241
SCIENTISTS AND ARE INVENTORS

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:42.278
AND OUR OUR CITIZENS- TO. MAKE

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.914
PROGRESS AND TO UP PUT THEIR

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.149
MINDS TO SUCCEEDING AND WE'VE

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.918
DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:51.921
INCREASE- TO IT THE CARBONIZED

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:54.223
OUR ELECTRICITY GOAL AS WELL AS

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:55.458
TO CONTINUE OUR WORK ON

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.326
REDUCING OUR AIR QUALITY

01:04:57.393 --> 01:05:00.696
CHALLENGES. BUT FRANKLY I THINK

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:03.165
WE WOULD BE WRONG TO RELY ON

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:06.168
THE PAST SUCCESS TO ASSUME THAT

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:08.004
WE CAN MAKE IT TO OUR TWENTY

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.805
THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:12.141
CLIMATE GOALS. BECAUSE THESE

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:14.644
ARE MUCH HARDER TO ACHIEVE AN

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.846
AUNT BECAUSE FRANKLY DONNELLY

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:18.981
IN WASHINGTON BUT IN OTHER

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:21.384
MAJOR EMITTING COUNTRIES AROUND

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:24.487
THE WORLD THE POLITICALWILL TO

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:26.455
ACT IS NOT. EVIDENT IN FACT

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:27.089
THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:29.125
PEOPLE ARE LESS WILLING TO

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.926
COLLABORATE AND COOPERATE THAT

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:34.096
SEEM TO BE. WHEN WE MET LEAD

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:35.564
MEETINGS THE COUNTRIES OF THE

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:38.401
WORLD MET. IN PARIS IN TWENTY

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:41.137
FIFTEEN- EVEN IF WE ARE

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:43.873
SUCCESSFUL IN BEATING BACK THE

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:44.573
ATTACKS ON CALIFORNIA'S

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.542
AUTHORITY WHICH WE BELIEVE WE

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.744
WILL BE AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULD

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:50.680
EIGHT NEVER THE LESS WE CAN'T

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:53.549
JUST DO IT BY OURSELVES SO. I

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:58.521
THINK THAT OUR GREATEST HOPE

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:03.392
LIES IN MAKING OURSELVES. IF

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:06.462
YOU. TRAIN OUR SYSTEM TO ONE WE

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.698
BUILD AROUND A RE

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:12.068
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND- THE

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:14.704
HOUSING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:17.540
THAT SIMPLY DOWN IN THAT

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.508
GREENHOUSE GASES AT ALL AND

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:22.511
THAT WE FIND WAYS TO TAKE THE-

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:25.047
ACCESSES THAT WE KNOW ARE GOING

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.115
TO EXIST BECAUSE THERE WILL BE

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:28.551
ACTIVITIES THAT AN ARRAY CO TWO

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:33.155
OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE I

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.925
THINK WE SHOULD GOOD IN THAT

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:38.928
REGARD. HE MADE OF. OTHER TIME

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.696
WHEN YOU KNOW HE HAVE FACED

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:43.532
REALLY EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:48.037
AND DANGERS AND RECOGNIZE THAT-

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:53.008
SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT- CONTINUE

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.910
TO HOLD OFF AND TWO HALF

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.946
MEASURES THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.180
ACTION THAT HAS REAL

01:06:58.247 --> 01:07:00.049
CONSEQUENCES SO. THIS IS A

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:02.752
CHALLENGE THAT IS BEFORE ALL OF

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:05.054

AND THE I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:28.277

SEEM TO KEEP- UNFOLDING- AND WE

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:16.258
WENT THROUGH IT ALL OVER THE

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:19.962
FALL- IN VERY REAL TIME.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:20.496
PEOPLE'S COMMUNITIES KEEP

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:23.032
BURNING DOWN AN- HOUR GOES OFF

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:25.501
FOR. HOW MANY MORE KIDS WENT TO

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:26.969
THE DOCTOR BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:30.639
ASTHMA. WE KNOW THESE IMPACTS

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.575
WELL BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:35.044
IN MY MIND TO. QUANTIFY THE

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:36.912
TRUE FISCAL RISK AROUND THEM

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.514
EITHER AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:39.315
COSTS IN THE STATE OF

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:40.416
CALIFORNIA APPRECIATE SOME OF

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:41.283
THE AIR STUDIES THAT HAVE COME

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:42.852
OUT OF. TWENTY EIGHT BILLION

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:44.753
DOLLARS WE FACES STATE IN ALL

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.155
THESE COSTS BUT I'M HOPING THIS

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:48.424
YEAR WE CAN. REALLY SCREW UP TO

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.926
THE FISCAL RISK THAT CLIMATE

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.161
POSES TO THE STATE AND OUR

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:55.197
BUDGET AS A WHOLE- I WANTED TO

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:59.301
ASK YOU JUST BRIEFLY. YES TWO

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:02.805
CENTRAL QUESTIONS- ONE OF THE

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:06.275
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:08.444
WHETHER YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:11.347
THE STATE OF THE MARKET THERE-

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.781
YOU KNOW EL CFS IS DRIVING A

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:14.350
LOT OF THE BEHAVIOR ON THE

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.318
TRANSPORTATION SIDE RIGHT NOW.

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.020
BUT I STILL I MEAN WHEN THE

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:19.188
PUBLIC AT LEAST LOOKS WHO

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:20.923
AREN'T TRADERS AN ART TRADE OF

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.925
UP TO SPEED ON. THE ALLOWANCE

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.193
ALLOCATION SCHEMES WHEN THEY

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.961
SEE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.930
DOLLARS A TON. AND WHERE THE

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.331
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND I

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:31.867
THINK WAS SOCIAL COST OF CARBON

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.903
THEIR STUDY THIRTY FIVE OR

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:34.637
FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A TIME AND

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:37.072
NOW I THINK MOST RECENT NOW SEE

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:38.107
SHOW ABOUT SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:41.377
TON- IS OUR PRICE ON CARBON

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:44.947
ACCURATELY REFLECTING. THE TRUE

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:45.481
SOCIAL COSTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:47.750
RIGHT NOW. THE PRICE OF

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:49.885
ALLOWANCES SO THE FLOOR PRICE

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:51.754
EVEN WITH THE ADDER THAT THE

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.656
MARKET IS NOW PUTTING ON AT

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:55.257
BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER TRADING

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.359
AT JUST THE FLOOR OR WHERE IT

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:59.562
CONSISTENTLY. A BIT ABOVE THE

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:02.398
FLOOR- IN- THE OPTIONS THAT

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:04.633
WE'VE BEEN HOLDING- DOES NOT

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.035
REFLECT THE SOCIAL COST OF

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:07.970
CARBON AND RECENT WORK THAT'S

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.905
BEEN DONE. ON THAT ON THAT

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.675
ISSUE INDICATES THAT PROBABLY

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.009
THE NUMBERS THAT THE OBAMA

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.611
ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING OUT

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:18.847
ARE ALSO LOW- BECAUSE THE- THE

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:20.282
MODELING AND THE CURRENT

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:22.017
INFORMATION CLEARLY I SHOWING

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:24.486
THAT. THE BUILD UP OF GASES AND

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:27.122
THE- DAMAGE BEING CAUSED IS

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:29.124
GREATER IT'S COMING FASTER I

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.793
GUESS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO PUT

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.161
THAT THE THINGS THAT. PEOPLE

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:33.295
WERE PREDICTING WHAT HAPPENED

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.797
BY THE END OF THE CENTURY ARE

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.765
HAPPENING EARLY IN THE CENTURY

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:39.935
INSTEAD SO- THERE'S NO REASON

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:41.003
TO THINK THAT TWENTY DOLLARS OF

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.406
THàNH IS THE RIGHT. PRICE FOR

01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:47.676
CARBON THE REASON WHY THE SET

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:51.614
THE PRICES AS WE DID IT AT THE

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.850
TIME KNEW THAT THAT THE BY TO

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:58.921
BE. REAL THE FOR CALL OF THE

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:03.225
DAY OUT JEFF OUR- OF GLOBAL WAR.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.727
FOR MANY. WAS THE WE WERE TO

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:07.296
SHOW. COULD HAVE A CAP ON TO

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:10.466
THIS THE ALL NO THOUGHT OF THE

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:13.335
TIME. THAT WOULD PERTAIN. OF

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:17.172
PRODUCE UP OUR PRO. WHERE YOU

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:29.151
WOULD HAVE ACT. READ OF.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.653
EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:31.920
MARKETS WAS ASKING QUESTIONS

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:34.390
ABOUT HOW STATE COULD EVEN DO

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:36.959
SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO OUR GOAL

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:39.928
WAS TO. CREATE A SYSTEM WHICH

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:43.699
WAS- DURABLE AND- COULD BE

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:47.236
IMPLEMENTED. AND THAT- FRANKLY

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:48.570
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUBJECT TO

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.873
IT WHICH SHOULD MAINLY WAS THE

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.941
REFINERS ON THE POWER PLANTS

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:56.245
AND- AND DRIVERS WHO. BY

01:11:56.311 --> 01:11:58.981
GASOLINE- COULD LIVE WITH THAT

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.482
IT WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD HAVE

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.884
RESULTS IT WOULD WORK BUT IT

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:05.487
WOULDN'T. BE SO- ONEROUS THAT

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:07.389
IT WOULD EITHER DISADVANTAGED

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.192
CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVELY OR OR

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:12.161
HEARD OUR CONSUMERS AND I THINK

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:15.197
WE DROVE DOWN A LINE THERE-

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:18.000
AND- AND WE DID IT I FEEL LIKE

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.802
WE DID IT VERY WELL AND THE

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:21.036
FACT THAT WE'VE HAD THIS. ROBOT

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:23.839
SYSTEM WITH A CALLBACK ALTHOUGH

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.641
THAT'S ALSO BEING CHALLENGED BY

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.609
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW HAS

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.411
ALSO BEEN A PROOF THAT WE CAN'T

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:31.780
EVEN DO THIS THE CRUX OF. THE

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.650
BUT INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY BUT

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:37.252
HAVING SAID THAT. WE ARE GOING

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:38.921
TO MOVE FORWARD AND YOU THE CAP

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:41.390
AND TRADE SYSTEM TO DROP FIVE

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:46.328
MORE REDUCTIONS. WE'RE GOING TO.

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.764
TAKE TO SEE THAT GOES UP THERE

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:49.331
ARE OTHER WAYS YOU COULD DO

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:49.965
THAT YOU CAN PUT A ON. THROUGH

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.867
ATTACK IT OF THAT'S A BEEN AN

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:52.501
IDEA THAT MEN PEOPLE THE YEARS

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:54.303
HAVE HAVE THOUGHT WAS A BETTER

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:57.940
FAIRER SYSTEM. SO YOU KNOW WE

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:59.842
ALL AND I THINK IT'S ALSO

01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:01.910
IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE- WE

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:03.779
LOOKED AT THE CARBON I JUST- IN

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.881
IN REGARD TO THE CAP AND TRADE

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:08.283
PRICE THAT. WE SAW THAT IS

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.220
BEING ADDED ON TO THE COST OF

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:14.656
THAT- CONSUMERS WOULD BE PAYING

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:17.459
TO MEET OUR OTHER REGULATORY-

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.261
PROGRAMS AS WELL SO THIS MIXED

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:21.530
PROGRAM THAT WE HAD. WITH THE

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:22.831
EMISSION STANDARDS FOR THE

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.333
VEHICLES AND THE LOW CARBON

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:26.702
FUEL STANDARDS ETCETERA IT ALL

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:29.571
AGAIN TOGETHER SO. AGAIN YOU'RE

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:30.773
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE COST OF

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:34.076
CARBON BUT- A WE CHANGE OR IF

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:36.345
AND WHEN WE CHANGE THE CAP AND

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.046
TRADE SYSTEM AS THE MAN TO

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:40.215
CLOSE TO BECAUSE I THINK. IS A

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:41.650
THAT CAN HAVE TO DISCUSS AS WE

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:45.687
DEVELOP THE NEXT COPING. IS FOR

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:47.022
THAT I THINK THROUGH THE- THIS

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.490
OAK POPPING UP EVEN THROUGH THE

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.092
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS I

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.126
KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:52.661
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CLIMATE

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:54.396
BUDGET HEARING THE SENATE. OR

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.731
ST TWO WEEKS EVERY TEN DAYS OR

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.733
SO. SO WE'LL PROBABLY BE

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.368
TRAILING DOWN ON THAT FURTHER

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:00.502
AND NOT TO SAY THAT THE PURPOSE

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:02.104
OF. OUR EMISSIONS TRADING

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.872
PROGRAM IS TO GENERATE REVENUE.

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:06.742
IT'S BEING LOOKED AT THAT THAT

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:10.345
WAY BUT IT'S IT INTENDED TO.

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:13.649
BUILD CERTAINTY AND- SOME KIND

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.384
OF BACKSTOP ON THE SYSTEM BUT

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:15.951
WE'RE GONNA BE RELYING ON A

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.686
MORE AND MORE. COURT THAT THE

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:20.055
MODELS ARE RIGHT- TO DRIVE

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.023
BROADER EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:23.358
SO. LOOK FOR ENGAGING WITH YOU

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:24.593
ON THAT THE ONE OTHER THING I

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:29.331
WANT TO ASK- IS THE- STRUCK BY

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:31.400
YOUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:34.770
ANALYSIS. AND I'M WONDERING

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:38.941
WHERE WE WOULD BE IN TERMS OF

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:39.541
THE TRAJECTORY TO HITTING OUR

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:41.109
SB THIRTY TWO GOALS IF WE

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:43.245
ACTUALLY DID ACCOUNT FOR

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.614
EMISSIONS FROM THE NATIONAL IN

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:48.383
WORKING LAND SECTOR SO SAVING

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:51.086
INVENTORY WAS. WHAT I WOULD

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.554
CONSIDER COMPLETE CONSIDERED

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:54.523
SORT OF A IT'S ONE IT'S ONE

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.792
SLICE OF THE INVENTORY RIGHT

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:57.392
NOW BUT IF WE SAID OKAY WE'RE

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.328
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT. FUGITIVE

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:02.097
EMISSIONS NETWORKING LANCE. HOW

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:05.167
ARE WE HOW FAR. BEHIND ARE WE-

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.402
IF WE LOOK AT THINGS. THROUGH

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:08.570
THAT LENS AND AGAIN I DON'T

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.205
WANT TO BE A DOWNER HERE TO ONE

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:13.308
WELL IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EQUAL TO

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:14.743
BUT IT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.845
NUMBER IT'S A BIG NUMBER-

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.348
CLOSER TO. WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.350
TARGETING WITH THE EXISTING

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:23.952
REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND THAT'S

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.454
ONE OF THE REASONS OF COURSE

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.556
WHY I'M- EMPHASIZING SO MUCH

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.424
YEAH THEY NEED TO GET AFTER.

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:32.861
WAYS TO CAPTURE AND RE USE OR

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:35.063
STORE KERR BUT CAN WE COUNT THE

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:37.199
SAME WAY I KNOW I BECAUSE I

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:38.567
KEEP THINKING. OKAY WE NEED A

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:41.370
THE- EARLY STAGE INVENTORY LIKE

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:43.238
BYRON SHEER DID THAT THEN LED

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:44.139
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME KIND

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.841
OF MARKET. IS THAT THE WRONG

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.175
WAY TO BE THINKING ABOUT

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:48.210
SOLUTIONS IN THE NATURAL

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.378
WORKING LANCE BASS OR DO YOU

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:50.846
THINK THE SCIENCE IS SOLID

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:52.381
ENOUGH THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:54.683
GET. AN ACCURATE INVENTORY SO

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.885
WE KNOW. YOU KNOW WHEN WE

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:58.053
INVEST IN THIS WETLANDS

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.389
RESTORATION PROJECT OR A RICE

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.190
FIELD CONVERSION OR A FORCE%

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:04.426
MANAGEMENT PROJECT THAT. WE'RE

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:05.727
GOING TO HAVE AT LEAST. SOME

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:07.729
ACCURATE BASELINE THERE AND

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:09.731
SOME CERTAINTY I WOULD JUST SO

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:12.067
YES AND NO MY SIMPLISTIC ANSWER

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:15.804
TO THAT IS. WE PROBABLY- OVER

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.839
CREDIT HAVE CERTAIN WE ARE

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.675
ABOUT EMISSIONS FROM WHAT WE

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.677
THINK OF AS CONVENTIONAL

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.779
SOURCES COMBUSTION THAT FUELS.

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.981
BUT WE CAN'T PUT ON THE MONITOR

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:27.916
ON A STACK AND ACTUALLY MEASURE

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:29.985
THE CO TWO COMING OUT OF THAT

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:32.187
SACK. AND YOU CAN YOU CAN HEAR

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:36.024
THAT UP WITH- THE FUEL THAT'S

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:41.763
GOING INTO THE THAT SAME. CALL

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:45.133
IT AND THE CARBON. OF THE FUEL.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.568
ROB VERY WELL SO WE CAN FEEL

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:47.836
QUITE CONFIDENT THAT WE KNOW

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.604
WHAT THOSE EMISSIONS ARE WHEN

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:53.008
IT COMES TO- FUGITIVE EMISSIONS

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:55.844
BURNING- IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT

01:16:55.911 --> 01:17:00.115
ESTIMATING- BUT THE TECHNIQUES

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:02.851
FOR EXAMPLE- MEASURING THAT IT

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:06.822
USING- INFRARED TECHNOLOGY TO

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:08.623
MEASURE WHAT'S GOING ON OVER A

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:11.360
WHOLE FOREST AREA- HAVE

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:14.129
IMPROVED REALLY DRAMATICALLY SO

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:16.565
THAT- I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:17.899
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.634
MORE THAN JUST A GAS OR A-

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.136
ORDER VALUE TO THAT WE'RE YOU

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.637
KNOW. WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:24.439
POINT WHERE YOU COULD

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:27.442
APPROPRIATELY SAY A PARTICULAR

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.911
REGULATION OR A PARTICULAR-

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:33.749
TYPE OF- CREDITING PROGRAM FOR

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:35.851
IMPROVE FOREST PRACTICES WOULD

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.919
ACHIEVE RESULTS AND YOU'D BE

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:40.088
PRETTY YOU'D BE ABLE TO SAY

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.156
WHAT THOSE WERE WITH A

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:44.092
REASONABLE DEGREE OF ACCURACY.

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:45.861
SO I'LL JUST WRAPPED THEN WITH

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:47.996
THIS WAY TELL ME IF I'M I'M

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.598
UNDERSTANDING YOUR COMMENT

01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:52.534
RIGHT. WE CAN SPEND A LOT OF

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:54.469
TIME WORKING ON POWER FUELS

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:56.405
BUILDINGS SORT OF THESE

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:58.673
TRADITIONAL DIRECT GREENHOUSE

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.709
GAS EMISSIONS SOURCES BUT IF WE

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:03.712
LEAVE. NATURAL WORKING LANDS

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:06.748
FUGITIVE MISSIONS THAT SECTOR

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.116
WE'RE REALLY ONLY TALKING ABOUT

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:11.186
ROUGHLY HALF OF THE PROBLEM IS

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:13.622
IT I MEAN ROUGH ROUGHLY HALF.

OF IMPACTS AND COSTS IN YOU

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:47.189

IN THE NEXT SCOPING PLAN.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:51.126
WHAT'S THE TIMETABLE FOR THAT

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:54.963
IN. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:57.165
CARP HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

01:18:57.232 --> 01:19:00.469
ADJUST THE PRICING ON THESE

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:01.970
ANNOUNCES THAT IT DOESN'T

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:03.805
REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:07.709
THAT ACCURATE YES YES- I THINK

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:10.645
THAT- THE WORKSHOPS THAT ARE

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.614
UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW THE CARD IS

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:15.016
CONVENING ARE ALREADY AT

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:18.487
ELICITING A LOT OF RESPONSE.

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:21.189
AND IDEAS FROM REGULATED

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:23.191
INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS FROM

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:25.660
SCIENTISTS AND ACADEMICS AND A

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:27.129
AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:28.730
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY AND

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:30.699
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ABOUT WHAT

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:31.933
IDEAS THEY'D LIKE TO SEE

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.768
PURSUED IN THE NEXT PLAN

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.504
CLEARLY WE DO NOT HAVE THE

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:37.572
AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE A TAX THAT

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.674
IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE

01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:43.345
COULD DO- AND PRICING. UNDER

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:45.514
THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM IF WE

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.582
WERE TO RAISE THE FLOOR PRICE

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:50.552
WE WOULD HAVE TO- GO THROUGH-

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.821
YOU KNOW HOLE I NOTICE AND RULE

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:55.457
MAKING PROCEEDING AND WE'RE

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:56.958
TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE HOPE IS A

01:19:57.025 --> 01:20:00.695
DECLINING POOL. OF ENTERED

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:01.997
THERE AND PART OF WHAT THE

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:04.199
DILEMMAS I THINK BECAUSE EVEN

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:06.168
THOUGH IT'S A QUOTA ECONOMY

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:08.170
WIDE TO CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:20:08.236 --> 01:20:11.039
IT REALLY DIRECTLY IMPACTS ONLY

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:12.274
THE PEOPLE WHO AFTER BY

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.843
ALLOWANCES AND THAT'S A SEVEN

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.579
HUNDRED. ENTITIES ROUGHLY IN

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.447
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IT'S

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:21.316
NOT LIKE I HAVE TO GO BUY

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:24.085
ALLOWANCES WHEN I- TURN ON MY

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.021
GAS WATER HEATER WHICH I STILL

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:27.389
HAVE YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:30.025
THIN SO IF WE WERE TO STARTED

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.927
TO ROLL DOWN. TOGETHER AT THE

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:35.764
SMALLER- SOURCES- WE WOULD HAVE

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:38.700
TO ALSO EXPAND THE COVERAGE OF

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:39.768
THE PROGRAM AND THE WAY THE

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:40.969
PROGRAM OPERATES SO THAT'S AN

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.771
OPTION YEAH BUT IT MAY NOT BE

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:45.507
THE ONLY ONE. THANK YOU. AND I

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.742
THINK THE OVER ARCHING THEME OF

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:49.678
YOUR PRESENTATION IS. THE

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:52.647
INCREASED URGENCY OF THE CRISIS

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:56.785
OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS- AND-

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:58.053
WELL WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE IN

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:01.289
CALIFORNIA. AS CALIFORNIA. WE

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.191
NEED TO DO MORE THAN WE'RE

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:06.127
DOING NOW. I THINK IT'S- IN

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.495
YOUR TESTIMONY AND IT'S KIND OF

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:09.297
COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT WERE.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:10.799
DOING A RELATIVELY GOOD JOB ON

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:13.602
RENEWABLES IN AND DEVELOPING.

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:16.238
THOSE RESOURCES AND MARKETS BUT

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.539
IT'S ON THE VEHICLE MILES

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.407
TRAVELED WHERE WERE FACING OUR

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:23.111
CHALLENGE YOU ALSO REFERENCED.

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:28.917
LITTLE BIT ON THAT NEXUS OF HOW

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:31.586
WE GET PEOPLE OUT OF CARS AND

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:34.122
HOW DOES THAT LINK TO HOUSING

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:38.193
POLICY AND- WHAT ROLE. WHAT

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.761
NEEDS TO BE DONE IT'S NOT BEING

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:42.998
DONE TO INCENTIVIZE IN WHERE

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.934
NECESSARY REQUIRING MANDATE-

01:21:56.878 --> 01:21:57.646
THEY'RE ALL LINKED AND IT'S

01:21:57.712 --> 01:21:59.180
HARD TO KNOW WHICH IS THE

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:02.117
CHICKEN AND WHICH IS THE AG- IF

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:03.985
THERE ISN'T AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:05.954
PEOPLE WILL LEAVE THE STATE

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:08.456
ULTIMATELY IF THEY CAN'T FIND A

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:11.559

PRODUCTIVITY AND WE'RE ALSO

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:25.640
INCREASING EMISSIONS AS THEY-

CONNECTS BACK TOGETHER AGAIN

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:04.279
AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:05.880
IT. IS OUR KIND OF OVER ARE

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:08.116
BEING NATURE OF WHETHER WE'RE

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:10.218

TURNING OVER THE VEHICLE PLATE

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:21.996
I COULDN'T REALLY ANSWER THE

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:24.165
QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK WE

IT IS OPTION IT I THINK. IN MY

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:33.108
WE HAVE A HUGE PERCENT OF WERE

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.310
FORCE DRY IN LITERALLY HOURS

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.045

TO JOB IN A WITH UNATTAINABLE

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:41.883
IN ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THE

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:44.586
OTHER PIECE OF THIS COMPLICATED

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:48.590
MATRIX INCLUDES PUBLIC TRANSIT.

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:50.024
IF THERE WERE AN INCREASE IN

01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:52.394
ALLOWANCES THAT GENERATED EVEN

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.296
A EVEN A RELATIVELY MINOR

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.399
INCREASE THAT WOULD GENERATE

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.601
MORE MONEY THAT WE OUR VISION

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:03.271
IS TO INVEST THOSE REVENUES IN

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:05.974
CARBON REDUCING. ACTIVITIES

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.175
SOARING LEVELING THE PLAYING

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:10.044
FIELD FOR PEOPLE WHETHER IT'S

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:13.047
TO ACCESS SEWER ON. HAS ANYONE

01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:15.216
GIVEN THOUGHT TO PROVIDING FREE

ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT IT'S

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.497
NOT A SPECIFIC MEASURE THAT

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.032
WE'VE LOOKED AT BUT IT'S BEEN

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.934
DISCUSSED OVER TIME I THINK-

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.202
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:36.204
THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT EVEN

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:39.073
GIVING FREE PASSES TO PEOPLE TO

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.508
USE TRANSIT DONE. DON'T

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.110
NECESSARILY ACCOMPLISH THE

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:43.945
RESULT IF THE BUS DOESN'T COME

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.080
NEAR WHERE YOU WHERE YOU HAVE

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:48.016
TO GO YOU KNOW WE HAVE PEOPLE-

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:50.552
OF LOS ANGELES WHO HAVE TO.

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:53.054
CALL A LIFTER RIGHT UBER CAR

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:55.190
WHEN THEY GET OFF THEIR JOB YOU

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:57.292
KNOW ON THE LATE SHIFT AND THE

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:59.127
BUS STOPS TOO FAR AWAY FROM

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:00.295
THEIR HOUSE AND IT'S TOO

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:02.363
DANGEROUS TO GET FROM WHERE THE

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.332
BUS STOP IS TO WHERE THEY'RE

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:06.835
GOING HOME. I'D I DON'T MEAN TO

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:09.838
SOUND AS GLOOMY ABOUT THAT-

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:12.740
OPTION SO MUCH AS TO SAY THAT I

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.709
THINK WE REALLY DO NEED A SORT

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:17.812
OF A- OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:20.448
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- THE

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.884
PERSON WHO IS A COMMUTING FROM

ANOTHER WORLD OF HURT IF

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:33.862
THEY'RE ALSO RUNNING THE RISK

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:35.063
OF HAVING THEIR PLACE BURNED

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.731
DOWN BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S TOO

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.700
CLOSE TO THE FIRE AREA SO IT'S

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:40.835
LIKE. WHERE DO YOU WHERE DO YOU

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:42.470

SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY THAT'S A

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:49.577
LOW CARB AND COMMUNITY AND THEN

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:52.780

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:24.546
TO CHALLENGE IT AND BRIEFING IS

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:27.081
GOING ON THE ROLE THAT OF THE

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.850
SECOND PART OF THAT RULE WHICH

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:31.452
IS THE ONE THAT. CHANGES THE

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:33.388
OBAMA STANDARDS AND EITHER

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:34.856
FREEZES THEM MORE MAKES THEM

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:37.525
MUCH LESS STRINGENT IS DUE OUT

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:40.295
ANY DAY NOW AND WE THINK THOSE

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:41.362
ARE PROBABLY END UP GETTING

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:43.431
LITIGATED TOGETHER THE THANK

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:45.300
YOU AND THEN. JUST FINAL ON

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:48.069
THAT. SOME OF THE AUTO

01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:49.571
MANUFACTURERS WHO HAVE

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.239
NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE OF

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:53.541
CALIFORNIA WHO WON EMBRACE THE

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:55.677
LOWER EMISSION STANDARDS. THOSE

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:57.312
HAVE BEEN BILATERAL

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:58.947
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.782
OF CALIFORNIA IN THE-

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:03.284
INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURERS YES WE

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.452
HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:06.321
THAT BECAUSE- NOBODY WANTS TO

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:08.556
RUN A FILE OF. ANTI TRUST LAWS

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:11.793
BUT- WE AS REGULATORS CAN WORK

01:27:11.859 --> 01:27:13.928
DIRECTLY WITH THE REGULATED.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:17.131
COMPANIES TO COME UP WITH-

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:19.734
ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE PATHS

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.235
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:26.975
FORD- VOLKSWAGEN HONDA AND BMW.

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:29.744
AND I THINK THAT. THAT YOU KNOW

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:30.778
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF SWIRL

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:32.447
GOING ON ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:35.850
WHEN THE WHEN THE- EPA COMES

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.152
OUT WITH THEIR FINAL ROLE BUT-

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:39.187
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:41.322
COMPANIES. EITHER SIGNING ON TO

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:44.292
THOSE AGREEMENTS OR VOLUNTARILY

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:46.594
SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:47.061
BETTER THAN WHAT THOSE

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:48.630
STANDARDS. THANK YOU I

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:50.031
APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.399
THAT AND I DID JUST WANT TO

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:52.066
GIVE YOU A CHANCE ON THE

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:54.302
RECORD. TO CONFIRM THAT THESE

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:55.470
ARE THE RESULT OF BILATERAL

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:58.940
NEGOTIATIONS THANK YOU THANK

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:01.309
YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU AT A

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:04.312
SERIES QUESTIONS. ARE WE YOU

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:05.013
KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:06.714
TRUMPETED STATION SECTOR YOU

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.282
TALKED ABOUT THE- NEED FOR

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:10.284
WIDESPREAD ELECTRIFICATION ARE

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:14.122
WE ON TARGET TO MEET OUR GOALS

01:28:14.188 --> 01:28:16.658
BY THIRD TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE ON

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:17.892
THE PATH BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.227
DON'T WE DON'T SEE THE END IN

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:20.895
SIGHT YOU KNOW I THINK THE

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:23.031
TRAJECTORY. IS GENERALLY

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:26.200
CORRECT BUT IT NEEDS TO BE-

01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:28.069
BAND TO THE CURVE NEEDS TO BE

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.103
BENT FURTHER TO MAKE TWENTY

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:31.406
THIRTY. AND I FELT WORKING ON A

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:34.542
NEW PLAN. A I MEAN SO WHAT ARE

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:35.943
SOME OF THE PROPOSED AS HE

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.879
TALKED ABOUT THE GOAL OF. CAP

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:40.381
AND TRADE AND- I WANT TO PUT

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:41.816
WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT IT'S ON

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:43.084
THE LIKE CAP AND TRADE THEN

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.420
ISN'T GONNA HELP GET US THERE-

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:48.122
IT'S SOME SORT OF A- MODEL OR

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:49.457
SAMPLE YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE TO

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:50.758
LOOK AT BUT- YOU KNOW HOW HOW

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.827
ARE REALLY GOING TO REDUCE THE

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:55.063
PETROLEUM. DEMAND THAT'S OUT

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:56.264
THERE BOTH THE YOU KNOW FROM

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:57.765
OUR OUR CARS BUT ALSO FROM

01:28:57.832 --> 01:29:00.034
REFINING FROM. PRODUCTION AND

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:03.171
SO FORTH. SO OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:08.376
PRIMARILY ON- THE DEMAND. SIDE

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:10.144
TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR.

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:14.082
PETROLEUM TO BE- TO BE PRODUCED

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:16.918
STORE REFINED IN CALIFORNIA. BY

01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:18.720
REDUCING THE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.788
BUY THIS STUFF. BY A- INSISTING

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:22.390
THAT THE CARS BE MORE EFFICIENT

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:23.858
AND THAT THEY WERE PRODUCED

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:26.094
LESS GREENHOUSE GASES. AND

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.929
RAPIDLY INCREASING THE NUMBER

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:29.697
OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAT

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:33.868
ARE OUT THERE- THERE ARE. AS

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:36.604
YOU KNOW- WAYS IN WHICH YOU

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.206
COULD SIMPLY. BAY AND

01:29:38.272 --> 01:29:40.141
PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM OR AT

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.043
LEAST DRIVE IN THAT DIRECTION.

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:44.645
BUT UP UNTIL NOW THE POLICY HAS

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:47.014
BEEN TO SAY. AS LONG AS WE'RE

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:48.983
STILL BUYING THIS STUFF. IT

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.384
WOULD BE PUTTING US AT AN

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:51.919
ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE IN

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.821
CALIFORNIA. IF WE WERE TO

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.156
REQUIRE THAT EVERYBODY WHO

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.158
NEEDED TO PUT GAS IN THEIR CAR

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.326
HAD TO BUY GAS THAT WAS

01:29:58.392 --> 01:30:00.061
IMPORTED. FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:01.829
SO. THERE'S A YOU KNOW WE AE

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:04.799
WE'RE PART OF A LARGER. MARKET

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:06.834
HERE FOR- FOR PETROLEUM

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.903
PRODUCTS. BUT AS WE LOOK

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:10.004
TOWARDS THE FUTURE TOWARDS A

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.707
REALLY ZERO EMISSION FUTURE.

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.108
THEN WE HAVE TO START THINKING

01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:16.210
ABOUT WHAT THE ROLE OF-

01:30:16.277 --> 01:30:17.712
PETROLEUM VERSUS ALTERNATIVE

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:20.815
FEELS IS GONNA BE. AND HOW WE

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:21.549
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.684
FUEL FOR THE KIND OF CARS THAT

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:25.019
WE WANT TO SEE DRIVEN AND I. I

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:27.522
SAY CARS BUT REALLY IT'S

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:30.258
EVERYTHING IT'S THE TRUCKS- AND

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:32.794
IF THE BUSES AND- ALL THE OTHER

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.862
OUT. OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT WERE

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:41.769
OPERATING AS- BUT IF WE NEED TO

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:45.807
HAVE A PER. YOU SALES OF. MAY

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:47.074
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE BE ELECT.

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:48.576
AND WERE NOT ANTI TO MEET THOSE

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:51.679
GOALS ARE SHOULD WE NOT BE

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:53.881
TALKED ABOUT HOW LEAVE REDUCE

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:56.284
EMISSIONS ARE PETROLEUM DEMAND

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:57.852
IN OTHER WAYS INCLUDING MAYBE

01:30:57.919 --> 01:31:01.022
RACING THE FLOOR. OF CAP AND

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:05.259
TRADE ALLOWANCES. I DON'T THAT

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:07.195
WOULD BE A SORT OF AN INDIRECT

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:09.463
WAY OF GETTING ABIT- THERE ARE

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.766
OTHER WAYS I THINK THAT WE CAN

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:14.202
SEE THE MARKET WHICH REALLY IS

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:16.270
GROWING ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:20.474
ALREADY- IMPROVE QUITE RAPIDLY

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.076
I DON'T MEAN TO PLACE TOO MUCH

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:23.945
EMPHASIS ON ADS AT THE

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.813
SUPERBOWL BUT I THINK THE FACT

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:28.616
THAT- EVEN GENERAL MOTORS WHICH

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:29.951
IS ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT%

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:32.520
SUING US OVER OUR AUTHORITY

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:35.189
CHOSE TO USE THEIR- HOWEVER

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.791
MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:38.426
COSTS THEM FOR THEIR YOU KNOW

01:31:38.492 --> 01:31:40.461
FEW SECONDS IN THE GAME TO

01:31:40.528 --> 01:31:42.530
ADVERTISE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:44.232
ELECTRIC CALMER MAYBE THAT'S

01:31:44.298 --> 01:31:45.533
WHAT THEY- THAT'S WHERE THEY

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.801
THINK THEIR FUTURE IS BUT

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:49.604
WHATEVER IT WAS. THAT'S THAT'S

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:52.073
WHAT THE INDICATES TO ME THAT

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:53.941
THEY BELIEVE THIS ISN'T JUST A

01:31:54.008 --> 01:31:56.077
MATTER OF- YOU KNOW DESIRE ON

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:56.978
THEIR PART BUT THEY THINK

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:58.279
THAT'S WHERE THE MARKET IS

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.181
GOING ALREADY SO IT'S MORE A

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:01.282
QUESTION I THINK OF WHAT WEEK

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:04.285
AS A STATE OF THAT HAS HIGHWAYS

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.354
UNDER OUR JURISDICTION THAT

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.055
THAT DOES TAXES THAT DOES A LOT

01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:09.357
OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHAT ARE

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:11.626
THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE- I MEAN

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:13.160
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADD SOME

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:15.463
CITIES ARE ALREADY LOOKING AT A

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:16.697
LOS ANGELES I KNOW IS LOOKING

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:20.701
AT TO CREATING ZONES- BY THE

01:32:20.768 --> 01:32:22.270
TIME OF THE OLYMPICS COMING TO

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.438
LA. ARE YOU COULDN'T GO INTO

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:27.108
THAT AREA WITHOUT ZERO EMISSION

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:29.310
VEHICLES SO THERE ARE THERE ARE

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:30.978
OTHER TOOLS AND I THINK IT'S

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:33.214
IMPORTANT TO COMPARE THEM WITH

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.882
EACH OTHER- AND SEE WHICH OF

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:36.484
THEM GET A STATE WE NEED TO GET

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:39.153
OUT AS COST EFFECTIVELY AS

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:45.192
POSSIBLE. WE JUST. WITH A- LEO

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:45.793
RIVER THAT HAVE COME OUT ABOUT

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.595
OUR- OUR PARK AND WHETHER OR

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.162
NOT WE'RE GOOD TO MEET OUR-

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:50.665
THIRD GOAL. AND WE HAD THE

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:52.133
TRANSPORTATION ONE THAT'S COME

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:53.367
OUT WE'VE HAD THE ENERGY SECTOR

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:54.468
HAS COME OUT WE'VE HAD A NUMBER

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:56.170
OF OTHER REPORTS THEM BY.

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:58.205
INDIVIDUAL GROUPS ARE SEPARATE

01:32:58.272 --> 01:32:59.140
FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:00.174
THEY'RE ALL POINTING TO THE

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:01.909
FACT THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:04.211
ARE GOING TO BE MEETING. ARE

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:05.112
TWENTY THIRTY HOLES RIGHT AND

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:07.515
SO WHILE THE MARKET MIGHT BE

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:08.649
SHIFTING AS A SHIFTING QUICKLY

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:10.718
ENOUGH AND IS NOT OUR JOB AS WE

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.053
TALK ABOUT CAP AND TRADE OR

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.988
CARPET TAX OR ANYTHING ELSE TO

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:15.589
HELP ME TO THE MARKET GETS

01:33:15.656 --> 01:33:16.791
THERE BY THE TIME WE NEED IT.

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:18.159
WE SET A GOAL OF TWENTY THIRTY

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:19.827
AND GET AND THAT WHAT WE

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:20.761
THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AT

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:21.529
THE END OF THE CENTURY IS

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:23.297
HAPPENING NOW WITH THAT GOAL

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:26.667
EVEN. WITH THAT TOO FAR AWAY DO

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:27.234
WE NEED MORE IMMEDIATE. ME

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:29.303
IMMEDIATE ACTION NOW AND SO YOU

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:31.539
KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:34.809
TO REVISIT WHAT THE PURPOSE OF

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:37.278
CAP AND TRADE IS. A LONG WAY IN

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:40.314
IT JUST TO CAN. THE COSTS

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:41.549
BRENDA. I SHOULD WE BE TALKING

01:33:41.615 --> 01:33:43.117
ABOUT SOCIAL COSTS ARE WHAT'S

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:43.851
GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR ECONOMY

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:45.152
WE DON'T ACT QUICKLY ENOUGH AND

01:33:45.219 --> 01:33:46.954
I THINK FOR MYSELF THIS IS

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.022
SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

01:33:48.089 --> 01:33:49.256
AT THIS ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:50.458
COMMITTEES THAT ARE THE MOST

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:51.659
BIRD AND WHERE HEALTH IS AT

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:54.662
RISK- EVEN MORE EVERY DAY THAT

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:55.830
SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE THAT

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:58.099
WE HAVE THERE. ON INTO YOUR

01:33:58.165 --> 01:33:59.834
THOUGHTS ABOUT. THE GOAL OF

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.102
CAPTAIN TRADING STATED A GOAL

01:34:01.168 --> 01:34:02.803
OR TO THEM TO THAT CONTINUE TO

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:04.372
BE OUR GOAL OR IS THAT

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:05.006
SOMETHING THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:07.341
BE THIS THAT. I THINK IT'S A-

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.442
THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:10.144
SCOPE A PLAN THAT WILL TAKE US

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:11.679
TO TWENTY THIRTY. THAT IS A

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.347
STATE WHERE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:15.149
THE- MISSION OF EVERYONE OF

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:17.318
THE- MEASURES THAT'S INCLUDED

01:34:17.385 --> 01:34:18.552
IN THE PLAN IS AND THAT

01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:20.654
INCLUDES CAP AND TRADE. AS I

01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:22.623
SAID WHEN WE DID THE ORIGINAL.

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:25.326
SCOPING PLAN GOING BACK TO TWO

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:27.028
THOUSAND AND EIGHT. WE SAW CAP

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:29.096
AND TRADE AS BEING. A WAY TO

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:30.598
PUT A CAP. WHICH WAS THE MOST

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:32.400
IMPORTANT FEATURE TO SAY. HOW

01:34:32.466 --> 01:34:33.701
MANY TOTAL EMISSIONS ARE

01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:35.870
ALLOWABLE. AND THEN TO CREATE A

01:34:35.936 --> 01:34:38.172
CREDIBLE SYSTEM. WHICH INCLUDED

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:40.541
A RECOGNITION OF THE FACT. THAT

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:41.842
OUR OTHER REGULATORY PROGRAMS

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:43.144
WERE GOING TO BE DRIVING DOWN

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.845
THE EMISSIONS. SO IT WOULD BE

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:46.814
MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE WHO

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:49.550
HAD TO. HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:52.153
THE PROGRAM. IT IS IN A SENSE

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:53.621
IT'S IN THIS WAS SO CLEARLY

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:55.423
DISCUSSED WHEN THAT. THE

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:57.892
LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THIRTY

01:34:57.958 --> 01:34:58.893
TWO YOU COULD LOOK AT CAP AND

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:00.961
TRADE AS BEING A TYPE OF CARBON

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:03.164
TAX IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:05.433
OF DOING IT WHERE. YOU KNOW THE

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.635
TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALLOW AND SAYS

01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:10.538
AND THE PRICE CAN VERY UNDER.

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:13.174
UNDER A CARBON TAX YOU SAT AT

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.943
AMOUNT OF PRICE- H. THàNH OF

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:19.113
CARBON AND- THEN PEOPLE CAN

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.448
CHOOSE HOW MUCH OF IT THEY WANT

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:22.817
TO USE. OR NOT. USE AND EITHER

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.518
ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF SYSTEMS

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:26.253
HAS PRINT SEVERAL CONSEQUENCES

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.955
TO IT. THE CAP AND TRADE

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:30.091
PROGRAM IS MORE. INDIRECT

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:33.894
PEOPLE DON'T SEE- AND- THAT

01:35:33.961 --> 01:35:35.229
SOMETIMES THAT'S FRUSTRATING TO

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:36.797
THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ARE

01:35:36.864 --> 01:35:38.432
SUBJECT TO THESE PROGRAMS. BUT

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.868
THE FACT IS THAT IT'S A THIS IS

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:43.737
A POLICY. CHOICE THAT THAT NEED

01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:45.539
TO BE MADE AND I THINK IT'S A I

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:46.640
THINK IT REALLY IS A CHOICE OF

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:49.043
THE- LATER ITSELF NEEDS TO.

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:52.179
NEEDS TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:55.816
IN. A I AGREE THAT WE AS LIST

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.218
JOURNEY TO BE THIS TEAM WERE

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:58.986
WERE AT WITH. WITH CAPTAIN AND

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:00.254
IF GIVEN THE NEW INFORMATION WE

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:01.956
HAVE AND THAT IS WHERE WE-

01:36:02.022 --> 01:36:03.657
CONTINUE ARE NOT I ALWAYS SAW

01:36:03.724 --> 01:36:04.959
IT AS- A WAY TO CLOSE THE

01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:07.228
DELTA- AND LOOKING AT THE

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:08.362
DIFFERENT REPORTS THE YOU KNOW

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:10.798
WE KNOW THAT OUR PS. IS I'VE

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:13.033
HAD A POSITIVE. EFFECT ON OUR

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.669
GOALS TOWARDS OUR WILLS ARE. WE

01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:17.605
THERE'S A FEW A FEW ITEMS OUT

01:36:17.671 --> 01:36:18.806
THERE THAT WE KNOW ARE YOU ARE

01:36:18.873 --> 01:36:19.907
YOU LEADING US IN A GOOD

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:20.808
DIRECTION BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.543
THINGS THT ARE NOT. ON AND SO

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:25.379
I THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT- CAP

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:28.516
AND TRADE AND IF WE NEED TO BE

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:29.583
TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE- IN.

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.652
POSSIBLY CHANGE. ARE THOSE THE

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:32.820
PRICING THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:36:32.887 --> 01:36:34.522
IS CHANGING BEHAVIOR AS WELL.

01:36:34.588 --> 01:36:35.823
WELL IT AND GET IT I THINK YOU.

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:37.658
MENTIONED THE FACT THAT- WHEN

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:38.926
IT WAS DESIGNED IT WAS NOT

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:40.761
INTENDED AS A REVENUE RAISER I

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:42.763
REALLY WANT TO UNDERSCORE. THAT

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.565
POINT. OF THE FACT THAT THERE

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:45.432
WAS A SMALL NUMBER OF

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:46.667
ALLOWANCES THAT THE STATE

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:49.170
DIDN'T JUST. VOLUNTARILY GIVE

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:50.337
TO THE SUBJECT TO THE PARTY

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:52.406
SUBJECT TO IT. WAS A THAT WAS

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:54.208
CONTROVERSY- BUT WE SAID. WE

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:56.143
NEED SOMETHING IN ORDER TO.

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:57.778
BASICALLY BE AND MAKE SURE

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:59.146
THERE'S TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:00.247
PRICE THAT PEOPLE WILL

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:01.815
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRICE IS.

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:03.484
AND AS IT TURNED OUT IT RAISED

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.352
A- SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:06.954
REVENUE WHICH IS THAT WE USE-

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:08.923
IT FOR VERY GOOD PURPOSES AND-

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:09.957
I MEAN I THINK YEAH IT'S BEEN

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:11.258
A- REALLY THAT HAS BEEN A

01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:13.093
BRILLIANT SUCCESS. BUT THE

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:16.230
PROGRAM WAS NOT DESIGNED WITH I

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:18.032
WAS ALMOST AN AFTERTHOUGHT.

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:20.034
YEAH NOW AFTER THE THAN I HAD

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:22.836
BECOME AND- THAT. PROGRAM OUT

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:24.738
THERE RIGHT SO DEFINITELY- LET

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:26.640
ME ASK YOU A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:37:26.707 --> 01:37:29.410
DIRECTION- BUT BUT TIED TO THE

01:37:29.476 --> 01:37:30.778
SAME DISCUSSION WHEN WE DID CAP

01:37:30.844 --> 01:37:32.379
AND TRADE WITH THAT AB SIX

01:37:32.446 --> 01:37:33.681
SEVENTEEN AND YOUR WEAPONS THAT

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:35.115
IN IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOUR

01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:36.417
EARLIER PART OF YOUR-

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:39.453
PRESENTATION- AND THE GOAL OF.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.622
OF THE OF CARDS YOU KNOW TO

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:43.390
HAVE CLEANER AIR OUT THERE IS

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.458
ALL THE OTHER PARTICULAR

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:45.459
MATTERS HE SHOWED US IN THE

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:47.795
FIRST HALF OF YOUR PRESENTATION

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:50.397
BUT IN THE BUDGET- THAT WAS

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:51.632
JUST PRESENTED IN JANUARY BY

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:54.902
THE GOVERNOR. THE COP TO AB

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:56.403
SEVENTEEN OUT THERE AND THE

01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:57.671
DISTRICT IMPLEMENTATION

01:37:57.738 --> 01:37:59.607
FUNDING- OTHERS TO CUT TO THE

01:37:59.673 --> 01:38:00.941
INCENTIVES FOR CLEAN CARS AND

01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:02.977
TRUCKS AND SO IT SEEMS TO BE

01:38:03.043 --> 01:38:05.346
KIND OF. COUNTRY TO SOME OF OUR-

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:06.814
AS WE LOOK AT THE PICTURE

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.148
HOMELESS. THE HAVE. INPUT ON

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:13.220
THAT OR- COMMENTS. I REALLY

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:14.855
COULD ONLY COMMENT THAT I THINK

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:16.991
THE BUDGET- REPRESENTS THE

01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:18.392
BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:20.728
WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL BE HAVING

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:22.997
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. YEAH

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:25.432
I MEAN. DEFINITELY AS LIZ WE'VE

WE'VE JUST OF FINISH THE FIRST

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.470
YOUR PLANS AND WE HAVE SELECTED

01:38:29.536 --> 01:38:30.204
THAT MAKES A HANDFUL OF

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:32.339
COMMUNITIES- IT IS A LITTLE

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:34.074
TROUBLING BUT WHEN WE THINK OF

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:35.009
THE GOVERNOR SCHOOL OF JUSTICE

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:37.311

ARE ONLY. TOOL THAT WE NEED IT

01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:43.384
IS ONE THAT IS ACTUALLY DRAWING

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:44.818
DOWN TO LOCAL LEVEL FOR MAKING

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:45.919
SURE HAT WE HAVE JUSTICE FOR

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:47.488
ALL. THAT'S SPECIFIC TO A

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:48.722
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY SAYS WE'RE

01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:49.723
LOOKING HOLISTICALLY AT THE

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:51.325
SYSTEM WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.060
THOSE SAME EMISSION TRANSIT WE

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:54.228
SORRY ON THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:55.029
REALLY PROUD OF HIS OF THE

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:56.697
STATE. CAN BE FELT BY ALL

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.565
CALIFORNIANS AND NOT JUST SOME

01:38:58.632 --> 01:39:02.036
CALIFORNIANS. OUT THERE. SO

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:04.705
THANK YOU FOR THAT I- FOR THE

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.373
SAKE OF. A SICK INTO MY OWN

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.276
TIMELINE. GOING TO GOING TO

CONTINUED DISCUSSION TO THE

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.816
BUDGET TO DO ADDITIONAL

01:39:15.883 --> 01:39:21.021
HEARINGS. AND I DIDN'T GET TO

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:22.990
ASK YOU ABOUT OUR TOPICS

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:24.224
RELATED TO THE SECOND PART OF

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.893
THE PRESENTATION I DO APOLOGIZE

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:29.863
I SAY JUST REALIZED- I LOST

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:30.798
TRACK OF MY HEALTHCARE- I WAS

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:32.199
SO BUSY WITH CAP AND TRADE IN

AB SIX SEVENTEEN. SO ACTUALLY.

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:38.539
IN THE SECOND HALF WE'RE GOING

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:40.274
TO BE THIS GUY ABOUT

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:40.808
OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:42.776
NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND I DIDN'T

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:45.012
GET TO ASK ANY OF YOUR OPINIONS

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:46.313
YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION DO

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.081
YOU WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:50.117
SAY ANYTHING WELL WE ARE

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:52.386
EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:54.288
HERE AS I MENTIONED WE DID

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.190
DEVELOP AN ACCOUNTING PROTOCOL

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:58.826
FOR- CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:00.794
SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS AND

01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:02.596
WE'RE AWARE NOW THAT DOWN

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:04.898
THERE'S A MOVEMENT TOWARDS

01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:06.667
BRINGING FORWARD AT LEAST ONE

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:09.203
PROJECT THAT. WOULD HOPE TO GO

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:10.404
THROUGH THAT KIND OF A NEW

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:11.805
SYSTEM AND WE THINK THAT WILL

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.907
BE A BIG INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:17.077
TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO DO IT-

01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:18.746
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING ON

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:21.348
THAT SAID- BEING FUNDED BY

01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:22.850
FOUNDATIONS AND OTHER

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:25.586
INSTITUTIONS WE DON'T HAVE A

01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:27.821
BUDGET RELATE TO BE INVOLVED IN

01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:29.189
THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:31.592
AREA THERE BUT WE'RE VERY KEEN

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.560
ON- I'M FOLLOWING WHAT'S

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:35.529
HAPPENING AND IF WE CAN FIND

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:39.900
WAYS THAT WE CAN- FURTHER.

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:42.603
INDUCE MORE PEOPLE TO- TO BRING

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:44.271
FORWARD AND EXPAND ON THESE

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:45.572
KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES WE THINK

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:47.341
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO WE

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:50.511
WILL BE TRACKING- GHG REDUCTION

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:52.379
SEPARATELY FROM GHG NEGATIVE

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:55.182
EMISSIONS OF WE WILL HAVE THAT

01:40:55.249 --> 01:41:01.355
YES. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:02.222
WELL THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

IN THE.

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.988
OKAY I THINK IS THAT WE

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:37.925
HAVE OUR SECOND PANEL. COMING

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:38.992
UP WHERE WE HAVE IMPACTS AND

01:41:39.059 --> 01:41:40.060
OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:42.296
NEGATIVE EMISSIONS OUT INTO

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:43.997
THAT COULD HAVE THOSE PANELISTS

01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:59.646
COME UP HERE PLEASE. AND SO TO

01:41:59.713 --> 01:42:01.715
THEY WERE HAVE GEORGE PERIOD AS

ABOUT THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:07.488
EMISSIONS ARE REACHING OUR

01:42:07.554 --> 01:42:08.956
STATE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS.

YOU FOR THE TIMELY INVITATION

01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:53.267
TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:54.768
GEORGE BURIED US. AND I'M

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:55.903
DELIGHTED TO REPRESENT THE

01:42:55.969 --> 01:42:57.471
LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.306
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE

01:42:59.373 --> 01:42:59.873
TOPIC OF NEGATIVE EMISSIONS

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.175
INTENTLY. ON THE LAST WEEK WE

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:04.344
RELEASED A COMPREHENSIVE FIRST

01:43:04.411 --> 01:43:05.112
OF ITS KIND REPORT THAT

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:07.781
OUTLINES. REALISTIC PATHWAYS

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:09.149
THAT ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO

01:43:09.216 --> 01:43:10.951
ACHIEVE ITS MID CENTURY CARBON

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:13.320
NEUTRALITY GOAL. WE FOUND THAT

01:43:13.387 --> 01:43:16.356
BY REMOVING CO TWO FROM THE F.

01:43:16.423 --> 01:43:17.658
THE STATE CAN ACHIEVE ITS GOAL

01:43:17.724 --> 01:43:19.526
AT A COST THAT IS LESS THAN

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:21.128
WHAT WE CURRENTLY SPENDS TO

01:43:21.194 --> 01:43:24.031
MANAGE TRASH. TODAY HUMM EAGER

01:43:24.097 --> 01:43:24.998
TO SHED SOME OF A OF THE

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:26.466
DETAILS OF WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED

01:43:26.533 --> 01:43:28.168
THE REPORT WAS CO AUTHORED BY

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:30.237
APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SCIENTISTS

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:32.205
ACROSS A TO RENOWNED CITIZENS.

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:33.340
AND ORGANIZATIONS AND MADE

01:43:33.407 --> 01:43:35.576
POSSIBLE THROUGH THE GENEROSITY

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.778
OF THE CLIMATE WORKS FOUNDATION.

01:43:37.844 --> 01:43:38.745
CALIFORNIA HAS ESTABLISHED

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:40.280
ITSELF AS AN INDISPUTABLE

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:41.848
LEADER IN CLIMATE CHANGE

01:43:41.915 --> 01:43:42.382
TECHNOLOGIES AND POLICIES

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:45.152
GLOBALLY. AND LATELY IS HAS

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:46.753
STEPPED UP ITS AMBITION LEVEL

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.121
CONSIDERABLY THROUGH GOVERNOR

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:49.790
BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THE

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:52.593
CALLS FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS

01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:55.262
TWO ZERO. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE.

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:56.897
REMOVING CO TWO FROM THE AIR IS

01:43:56.964 --> 01:43:58.999
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BE CERTAIN

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:00.701
TO ACHIEVE THIS FILE GOAL.

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.302
DOING SO IS NEITHER A LICENSED

01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:04.571
TO CONTINUE POLLUTING. NOR

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:05.539
LUXURY THAT WE CAN DO AWAY

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:07.674
WITH. THE PRECIPICE

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:08.909
UNFORTUNATELY REALLY IS BEFORE

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:11.044
US. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE CAPITOL

01:44:11.111 --> 01:44:13.680
STEPS TO REDUCE AND MANAGE OUR

01:44:13.747 --> 01:44:16.316
RISK OF FAILURE. WHEN I WAS A

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:18.785
TAKING AVALANCHE TRAINING I WAS

01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:19.786
STRUCK BY SOMETHING THAT'S THE

01:44:19.853 --> 01:44:21.755
NOLLIE. MOUNTAINEERING RANGER

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:24.157
DAVE WEBER SAID. HE SAID THAT

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:25.859
ALL HOPE IS A HORRIBLE RISK

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:28.095
MANAGEMENT TOOL. AND THE WHEN

01:44:28.161 --> 01:44:29.463
WE WERE LONG ON HOPE TO KEEP US

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.031
SAFE. WE ARE PROBABLY IN HARM'S

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:33.667
WAY. I AM PROUD TO LIVE IN A

01:44:33.734 --> 01:44:35.268
STATE THAT ENABLES ME TO HAVE

01:44:35.335 --> 01:44:37.270
SOLAR PANELS ON MY ROOF AND TO

01:44:37.337 --> 01:44:39.306
DRIVE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE. BUT

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:40.841
SINCE WE CANNOT CONFIDENTLY

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:41.908
TELL OUR CHILDREN TODAY THAT

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:43.944
OUR EFFORTS TO USE ENERGY MORE

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:45.479
EFFICIENTLY GENERATE POWER FROM

01:44:45.545 --> 01:44:48.048
RENEWABLE SOURCES. AND PUT

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:48.615
CLEAN IT BECAUSE ON THE ROAD

01:44:48.682 --> 01:44:50.584
ALONE. WILL REDUCE OUR

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:53.387
EMISSIONS TWO ZERO BY TWENTY

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:54.821
FORTY FIVE. WE SIMPLY CANNOT

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.323
OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:57.224
THAT CAR STRATEGIES WILL

01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:59.626
SUFFICE. WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:00.661
THAT THE EQUATION FOR REACHING

01:45:00.727 --> 01:45:02.996
THAT ZERO MAKE CHANGE AND

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.998
REQUIRE AN EVEN BIGGER EFFORT.

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.100
IT IS CLEAR THAT'S TO SOLIDIFY

01:45:07.167 --> 01:45:08.335
CHANCES OF ACHIEVING THEGOAL

01:45:08.402 --> 01:45:09.636
WE MUST THAT IN YOU STRATEGIES

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:11.672
TO THE MIX. THE PHYSICALLY

01:45:11.738 --> 01:45:14.341
REMOVE CO TWO FROM THE AT. AND

01:45:14.408 --> 01:45:16.209
REPORTS WE SET OURSELVES A

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:17.210
CHALLENGE OF SEEING IF

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.413
CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE A

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:20.814
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE. MILLION

01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:23.150
TONS PER YEAR. OF NEGATIVE

01:45:23.216 --> 01:45:24.818
EMISSIONS. USING ONLY

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:27.287
TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES THAT

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:29.022
ARE RIGHT TO BE SCALED UP TODAY.

01:45:29.089 --> 01:45:30.057
THIS NUMBER REPRESENTS THE

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:31.591
LEVEL OF RIGID RESIDUAL

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:32.893
EMISSIONS THAT WE REALISTICALLY

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:35.062
EXPECT TO REMAIN BY MID

01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:36.830
CENTURY. DESPITE ALL OTHER

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:39.066
MITIGATION EFFORTS. I'M HAPPY

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:40.701
TO REPORT THAT IN GETTING TO

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:42.636
NEUTRAL OPTIONS FOR NEGATIVE

01:45:42.703 --> 01:45:44.705
EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. WE

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:46.707
FIND SAID THAT THE STATE'S CAN

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:47.274
DO THAT'S USING THREE MAIN

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.543
APPROACHES. HARNESSING THE

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:51.845
POWER OF MOTHER NATURE. PUTTING

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:53.847
WASTE BIOMASS TO WORK AND

01:45:53.914 --> 01:45:54.981
PHYSICALLY SCRUBBING CO TWO

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:57.918
FROM THE AIR. OUR FIRST

01:45:57.984 --> 01:45:59.252
APPROACH ENTAILS STORING MORE

01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:01.488
COMMON FORESTS WETLANDS

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:03.490
GRASSLANDS AND SOILS. THROUGH

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.192
RESTORATION CHANGES TO THE WAY

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:06.760
THE CALIFORNIA MANAGES ITS

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:08.695
NATURAL WORKING LANDS WE COULD

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:10.931
STORE AN ESTIMATED TWENTY FIVE

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:13.033
MILLION TONS OF CO TWO PER YEAR

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.868
WHILE BENEFITING OUR ADD WATER

01:46:14.935 --> 01:46:15.669
AND THE RESILIENCE OF THE

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:17.070
SYSTEMS TO CHANGES IN OUR

01:46:17.137 --> 01:46:19.606
CONDITIONS. UNFORTUNATELY

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.208
NATURE CAN ONLY DELIVER UP TO A

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:23.510
FIFTH OF THIS TARGET. THE

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:24.811
SECOND LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:26.079
NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND TELLS

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:27.681
PUTTING CALIFORNIA SUBSTANTIAL

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:29.750
WASTE BY MASS RESOURCES TO WORK

01:46:29.816 --> 01:46:31.151
CONVERTING THEM INTO RING YOU

01:46:31.218 --> 01:46:32.786
WILL TRANSPORTATION FUELS WHILE

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:34.287
APPARENTLY REMOVING AND STORING

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:35.989
THE CARBON. THE BIOGENIC

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:38.759
PORTION OF URBAN TRASH RESIDUES

01:46:38.825 --> 01:46:39.292
FROM AGRICULTURE AND FORCE

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.628
THINGS. THAT THE STATE WILL BE

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:42.996
REMOVING FOR FIRE RISK

01:46:43.063 --> 01:46:44.197
REDUCTION CAN BE CONFERRED

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:45.899
CONVERTED INTO COMMON NEGATIVE

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.734
TRANSPORTATION FUELS. THESE

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:49.569
ALSO IMPROVE OUR QUALITY BOTH

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:51.238
BY DOING AWAY WITH THE CAR IN

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:53.039
PRACTICE OF BURNING WOOD. AND

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:55.142
ALSO BY DISPLACING FOSSIL FUELS

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:57.277
FROM THE WROTE. A REPORT FINDS

01:46:57.344 --> 01:46:58.278
OF THE STRATEGY COULD COULD

01:46:58.345 --> 01:46:59.846
DELIVER BETWEEN EIGHTY AND

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:00.881
NINETY MILLION TONS OF CO TWO

01:47:00.947 --> 01:47:04.017
PER YEAR. OF NEGATIVE EMISSIONS.

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:05.352
FINALLY THE THIRD APPROACH AND

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:07.487
FALSE USING MACHINES A SCRUB CO

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:08.722
TWO FROM THE AD IN A PROCESS

01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:10.524
CALLED DIRECT TAKE CAPTURE.

01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:11.558
THIS CAN BE APPLIED AND WHETHER

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:13.493
WE HAVE GEOTHERMAL HEAT ON

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.662
NATURAL GAS. AND WE CAROLINE

01:47:15.729 --> 01:47:18.965
THE STRATEGY TO MAKE AS LARGE.

01:47:19.032 --> 01:47:19.566
A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR GOAL AS

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:20.967
WE CHOOSE. NONE OF THESE

01:47:21.034 --> 01:47:22.469
STRATEGIES RELYING ON

01:47:22.536 --> 01:47:24.070
TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:24.571
MOST OF THEM ARE READILY

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:27.174
AVAILABLE. AND OTHERS WILL

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.743
NEEDS HELP. SIMPLY TO REDUCE

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:32.879
COSTS. THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:34.214
THE NUMBERS WHERE A PLEASANT

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:36.449
SURPRISE TO US THIS COMBINATION

01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:37.284
OF APPROACHES IS EASILY

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:39.753
AFFORDABLE AND COSTS RANGE

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:40.387
BETWEEN A FEW DOLLARS PER TONNE

01:47:40.453 --> 01:47:43.623
OF CO TWO. AND LESS THAN TWO

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:44.891
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TONNE OF CO

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.159
TWO FOR DIRECT I CAPTURE AFTER

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:49.596
A MODEST AMOUNT. OF LEARNING.

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:51.832
THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE IS LESS

01:47:51.898 --> 01:47:53.700
THAN TEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:54.801
LESS THAN WHAT CALIFORNIA

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:56.503
SPENDS ON MANAGING ITS TRASH

01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:58.038
AND ONLY ZERO POINT FOUR

01:47:58.104 --> 01:47:59.506
PERCENTS OF THE STATE'S CURRENT

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:02.209
GDP. YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING

01:48:02.275 --> 01:48:03.910
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CARBON THAT

01:48:03.977 --> 01:48:06.413
WE REMOVE- THAT ISN'T STORED IN

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:07.881
NATURAL SYSTEMS SYSTEMS WHAT IS

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:10.817
I GO. WELL IT'S GOES RIGHT BACK

01:48:10.884 --> 01:48:12.552
WHERE IT CAME FROM IT CAN BE

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:13.553
STORED IN THE SAID IMMENSELY

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:16.122
ROCKS THAT HAVE HELD WATER GAS

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:18.258
AND OIL FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:19.693
AND WELL WE DUG UP THE CARBON

01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:21.161
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:23.196
CALIFORNIA'S TRULY BLESSED WITH

01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:25.465
EXCEPTIONAL GEOLOGY. AND BASINS

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:26.967
THAT CAN STORE LIQUID CO TWO

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:29.336
SAFELY AND PERMANENTLY. AND WE

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:30.904
ALSO HAVE THE WORLD'S NEWEST

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:32.639
INSTRUCTORS REGULATIONS THAT

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:34.841
GOVERN CO TWO INJECTION. THANKS

01:48:34.908 --> 01:48:36.176
TO THE VISION RE EFFORTS AND

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:37.244
THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:39.079
UNDER CHEN NICHOLS COMPLETED

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:41.114
JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. WHEN IT

01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:42.916
COMES TO CLIMATE MITIGATION

01:48:42.983 --> 01:48:44.918
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO

01:48:44.985 --> 01:48:47.454
MUCH OR TOO FAST. WE NEED ALL

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.557
SAFE APPROACHES ON THE TABLE.

01:48:50.624 --> 01:48:52.659
THE URGENCY IN MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:53.560
PROBLEM SIMPLY DO NOT AFFORD US

01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:55.295
ANY WIGGLE ROOM THE NEGATIVE

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:56.763
EMISSIONS PATHWAYS THAT WE HAD

01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:58.465
DONE TO FIND IN A IN THE

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.567
REPORTS. A WELL WITHIN THE

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:01.635
STATE'S REACH AND ARE AN

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:03.370
IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTS TO THE

01:49:03.436 --> 01:49:05.105
MITIGATION TOOLS A CALIFORNIA

01:49:05.171 --> 01:49:06.940
HAS ALREADY CHAMPIONS. WHAT'S

01:49:07.007 --> 01:49:07.974
MORE THESE APPROACHES WILL

01:49:08.041 --> 01:49:09.643
CREATE JOBS IN THE STATE WHERE

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:11.845
THEY ARE MOST NEEDED. THEY WERE

01:49:11.912 --> 01:49:13.980
DISPLACED ALSO FUELS IT WOULD

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:16.049
HELP CLEAN UP AND WATER AND

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:17.951
THAT WOULD PROTECT LIFE AND

01:49:18.018 --> 01:49:18.485
PROPERTY THROUGH WILDFIRE

01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:21.554
PREVENTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:23.590
STATE HAS REACHED ITS NIKE

01:49:23.657 --> 01:49:25.892
MOMENTS AND CLIMB IN MITIGATION

01:49:25.959 --> 01:49:28.495
IT IS TIME TO JUST DO IT. AND

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:30.697
SIGNED A TEAM STAND TO HELP-

01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:32.032
STAND READY TO HELP IN ANY WAY

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:39.272
THAT WE CAN. THANK YOU. THANK

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:39.839
YOU WILL BE THE NEXT

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:41.975
PRESENTATION I'LL ASK QUESTIONS

01:49:42.042 --> 01:49:45.545
AT THE END OF ALL. THANK. HI MY

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:46.880
NAME'S BLAKE SIMMONS- DIVISION

DIRECTOR OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:49.249
AND ENGINEERING AT LAWRENCE

01:49:49.316 --> 01:49:51.217
BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY.

01:49:51.284 --> 01:49:53.119
GET THE SLIDES UP AND- BY

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:55.555
MINUTES. I WILL GIVE YOU A BRO

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:56.890
WHEN HIGH LEVEL TOUR OF A

01:49:56.957 --> 01:49:58.658
VARIETY OF PROJECTS THAT. DON'T

01:49:58.725 --> 01:50:01.995
FEEL VERY NICELY WITH THE- THE

01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:02.595
REST OF THE PRESENTATION THAT

01:50:02.662 --> 01:50:04.831
YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. AND SO-

01:50:04.898 --> 01:50:05.899
WITH A FOCUS ON THOSE THAT

01:50:05.966 --> 01:50:07.133
REALLY ENABLE A CIRCULAR

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.469
ECONOMY AND ALSO HAVE THE

01:50:09.536 --> 01:50:10.804
POTENTIAL FOR NEGATIVE CARBON

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.272
EMISSIONS. AND JUST PUT IT IN

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:13.873
CONTEXT ABOUT THIS NOTION OF A

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.742
CIRCULAR ECONOMY- THIS IS A

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.944
WASTE NOT WANT NOT- TYPE OF

01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:19.546
APPROACH FOR CARBON MANAGEMENT

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:21.348
AND FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. WHERE

01:50:21.414 --> 01:50:23.883
YOU BASICALLY HAVE AN ECONOMY

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:25.251
THAT IS BASED ON MULTIPLE

01:50:25.318 --> 01:50:26.953
PASSES OF THE SAME CARBON.

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:28.455
THROUGH ALL OF THE STEPS THAT

01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:31.024
YOU SEE HERE OF OUTLINED HERE.

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:32.726
ON THAT CHART ON THE RIGHT- THE

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.327
BIO CONNIE IS A PART OF THAT

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:36.196
AND THE BIO COM UNITED STATES

01:50:36.262 --> 01:50:37.297
IS ROUGHLY ONE TRILLION DOLLARS

01:50:37.364 --> 01:50:39.566
A YEAR NOW. SO IT'S NOT A-

01:50:39.632 --> 01:50:40.834
INSIGNIFICANT THING THAT WE'RE

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:41.935
TALKING ABOUT THE NOTHING ON

01:50:42.002 --> 01:50:43.303
THE FRINGES IT IS VERY.

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:45.205
MAINSTREAM AND CALIFORNIA'S AT

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:47.107
THE FOREFRONT OBVIOUSLY OF

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:49.275
LEADING THE WAY TO THE TO PAINT

01:50:49.342 --> 01:50:51.077
THE WAY FOR. A CIRCULAR CONNIE

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:53.380
AND- GERMAN NICHOLS POINTED OUT

01:50:53.446 --> 01:50:55.815
THESE- SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES

01:50:55.882 --> 01:50:56.416
THAT COULD BE OPERATING ON THE

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:59.652
CIRCUIT. I MEAN WHERE YOU BASS

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:05.425
HE REVIEWS RE UTILIZE AND RICK.

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:06.726
THE CALIFORNIA CAR RESOURCES

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:08.595
ARE DISTRIBUTED- AS WAS

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:09.462
MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:11.431
UNIQUE GEOGRAPHIC AND NATURAL

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:13.533
RESOURCES THAT ARE STRATEGIC TO

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:14.968
VOTE THE ECONOMY INTO THE

01:51:15.035 --> 01:51:16.169
ENVIRONMENT IN THE STATE.

01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:17.337
OTHERS ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:18.772
MILLION BONE DRY TIMES THAT ARE

01:51:18.838 --> 01:51:20.507
AVAILABLE TO CONVERT INTO

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:22.542
SOMETHING. EACH YEAR. AND THE

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:24.244
QUESTION IS NOT WHAT. YOU KNOW

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:26.079
CAN WE MAKE NOT LOOKING FOR A

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:27.647
SILVER BULLET. BUT REALLY

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:29.282
LOOKING AT A PRIORITIZE WAY TO

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:30.517
MANAGE THAT RESOURCE

01:51:30.583 --> 01:51:31.951
APPROPRIATELY EFFECTIVELY.

01:51:32.018 --> 01:51:33.486
SECOND HAVE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:35.655
TO THE ECONOMY THE ENVIRONMENT

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:37.791
AND HUMAN HEALTH. BY

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:39.426
MANUFACTURING THIS IS THE VERY

01:51:39.492 --> 01:51:40.660
SIMPLE CARTOON OF WHAT I'M

01:51:40.727 --> 01:51:42.295
TALKING ABOUT. IS YOU HAVE

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:43.730
MULTIPLE INPUTS THAT ARE COMING

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.698
INTO SOMETHING THAT CAN REPLACE

01:51:45.765 --> 01:51:46.833
MANUFACTURING THAT WE KNOW

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.201
TODAY IN A CONVENTIONAL SENSE.

01:51:48.268 --> 01:51:49.636
AND THESE COULD BE SUGARS THAT

01:51:49.702 --> 01:51:50.804
ARE LIBERATED FROM THE MISSILE

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:52.906
AS A BIOMASS TREES GRASSES WHAT

01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:54.641
HAVE YOU- THEY CAN BE LINK THEN

01:51:54.707 --> 01:51:55.909
FROM THOSE SAME RESOURCES AND

01:51:55.975 --> 01:51:58.211
THEY CAN ALSO BE WASTE STREAMS

01:51:58.278 --> 01:51:59.979
BE THEY FROM FORESTRY FROM

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:02.549
AGRICULTURE INCLUDING MUNICIPAL

01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:04.084
SOLID WASTE. AND THE POINT IS

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:05.485
THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE ALL THESE

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:07.554
CARBON INPUTS AND PUT THEM INTO

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:09.489
AN APPROACH RE CAN GENERATE

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:11.624
MULTIPLE OUTPUT GET OFF OF

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:14.694
EVERY ASPECT PETROLEUM. WHY THE

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:16.429
JOB FOR CHEMICAL COMPANY OR

01:52:16.496 --> 01:52:17.897
FUELS AND DO SO IN A

01:52:17.964 --> 01:52:19.432
SUSTAINABLE WAY THAT MAXIMIZES

01:52:19.499 --> 01:52:21.401
THE IMPACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT

01:52:21.468 --> 01:52:25.271
THE HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY. ONE

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:25.905
EIGHT. OF THAT IS TRANSITIONING

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:27.240
OR WAY FROM GREEN GAS SOURCE

01:52:27.307 --> 01:52:28.508
THE SINK IN THIS WAS ALLUDED TO

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:30.543
IN THE EARLIER TALK. ABOUT THE

01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:32.679
MANAGE AN ACTIVE LANDS THAT THE

01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:33.680
PRACTICES AND LAND MANAGEMENT

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:34.547
PRACTICES THAT CAN ACTUALLY

01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:36.749
GENERATE A CARBON SINK OUT INTO

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:38.985
THESE MANAGE LANDS. AS A WE CAN

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:39.686
INCREASE THE QUANTITY OF BOMB

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:40.854
MASSIVE REQUIRES THIS

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:42.222
MANAGEMENT CONVERSION WE'VE

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:43.289
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT ACCOUNTING

01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:45.892
STANDARDS IN TERM NICHOLS TALK.

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:46.559
BUT ALSO INCREASE THE

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:48.394
GENERATION OF BY PRODUCTS SUCH

01:52:48.461 --> 01:52:50.396
AS DIGEST STATES COMPOST AND BY

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.665
WHICH ARE. THEY CAN BE USED

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:53.199
WITH THE VANCE PLAN MATTER

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:55.201
PRACTICES THE DRIVE THAT CAR.

01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:56.369
FORWARD THE MAXIMIZE THE

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:57.871
BENEFIT AND TRANSFORM WHAT IS

01:52:57.937 --> 01:53:00.306
CURRENTLY A POLLUTANT SOURCE OF

01:53:00.373 --> 01:53:02.041
CALL IN AND TURN IT INTO A SINK

01:53:02.108 --> 01:53:04.444
THAT CAN BE USED TO ENABLE. THE

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:06.746
STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:08.281
REDUCTION TARGETS. THE ROLE OF

01:53:08.348 --> 01:53:10.416
BIO TURNED JUST SAY THE NET

01:53:10.483 --> 01:53:12.352
ECONOMY IS HERE AND THE NUMBERS

01:53:12.418 --> 01:53:13.820
ARE. ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE BUT

01:53:13.887 --> 01:53:16.189
WE COULD OVER TIME BASICALLY

01:53:16.256 --> 01:53:18.057
ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:19.192
GREENHOUSE GAS MEDIC A

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:20.894
EMISSIONS. A IF YOU TAKE IT

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.395
OVER SEVERAL DECADES AND SO

01:53:22.462 --> 01:53:24.330
THIS IS A VERY. INTERESTING

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:25.899
APPROACH THAT IS CAN BE VERY

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:26.900
EFFECTIVE IN VERY SIMPLE TO

01:53:26.966 --> 01:53:28.601
IMPLEMENT. AND DOVETAILS NICELY

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:29.969
WITH THE POLICY REQUIREMENTS OF

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.638
YOU WERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT.

01:53:31.704 --> 01:53:32.972
THERE'S ALSO THE NOTION INITIAL

01:53:33.039 --> 01:53:34.407
SOLID WASTE AS A BIOLOGY

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:36.142
FEEDSTOCK IN SO IN RURAL AND

01:53:36.209 --> 01:53:38.344
URBAN AREAS IN PARTICULAR-

01:53:38.411 --> 01:53:40.947
THERE IS A LOT OF WAYS THAT IS

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:41.848
GENERATED THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY

01:53:41.915 --> 01:53:43.149
BEING. BALLERUP ISN'T ANYTHING

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:45.118
USEFUL FOR. ME TO BENEFIT THE

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:46.386
ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH.

01:53:46.452 --> 01:53:47.987
AND SO THERE'S A PROJECT THE

01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:49.589
THAT WAS A JOINT ONE BETWEEN I

01:53:49.656 --> 01:53:50.390
DON'T NATIONAL LABORATORY

01:53:50.456 --> 01:53:52.292
SANDIA NORTH BERKELEY. WHERE WE

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:53.760
DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES TO DO

01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:54.994
BLENDING OF MUNICIPAL SOLID

01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:56.496
WASTE STREAMS AND CONVERT THEM

01:53:56.563 --> 01:53:58.031
INTO BILE FEELS ABOUT PRODUCTS.

01:53:58.097 --> 01:54:00.033
THAT COULD GO INTO THE ECONOMY

01:54:00.099 --> 01:54:02.101
AND BE OF NET BENEFIT. TO BOTH

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:05.772
IN. AND HUMAN HEALTH. AS WHEN

01:54:05.838 --> 01:54:07.507
HE TAKE A LOOK AT THE FOOD. AND

01:54:07.574 --> 01:54:10.143
PAY WAY. I CAN VAL RISE THOSE

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:12.078
ARE. LEASE IN FILE FEELS ABOUT

01:54:12.145 --> 01:54:13.279
PRODUCTS AND WON'T. GET INTO

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:14.647
LIKE THE NEED TO BE HERE ON THE

THROUGH WILD FIRES. AND DEPLOY

01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:49.382
A TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED

01:54:49.449 --> 01:54:50.717
AT THE NATIONAL LABS IN

THEM INTO BILE POWER BIO FUELS

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:56.215
AND BIO CHART. AND THIS COULD

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:57.350
MINIMIZE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:59.218
EMISSION BY ABOUT 90% IT'S

01:55:59.285 --> 01:56:00.420
SIGNIFICANT SNIFFING THE

THIS PROGRAM. AND SO THIS WORK

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:22.989
IS HAPPENING AND ALL DIFFERENT

01:59:23.055 --> 01:59:25.658
SCALES FROM THE VERY LARGE-

01:59:25.725 --> 01:59:27.827
FROM FOREST SCALE RANCH SCALE

I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:59:31.397 --> 01:59:33.132
ABOUT THAT SMALLER SCALE WORK

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:34.233
WHICH I THINK REALLY HELPS TO

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.002
IN BED. AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE

01:59:36.068 --> 01:59:38.437
CAN PROMOTE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS

01:59:38.504 --> 01:59:40.806
ALONG SIDE COMMUNITIES

STAKEHOLDERS AND PEOPLE AND I

01:59:42.742 --> 01:59:44.277
THINK YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THESE

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:47.480
IDEA AS ACTUALLY START TO BE

01:59:47.547 --> 01:59:50.483

GRAMS PER SQUARE MILE OR LESS

02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:08.768
INTENT TO MAKE IT IT'S A TRICK.

02:00:08.834 --> 02:00:13.172
THAT'S MEANT TO CATTLE. ENGINE

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:19.211
MOST ANISH THREE. POINT IT'S BY

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:22.515
A COMMUNITY RATED THEN AT SOME

02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:27.386
IS KEEP CO RATE AND OKAY SO THE

02:00:27.453 --> 02:00:32.825
NIKKEI MAY. THINKING WORKS TO.

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:39.398

RID TO REACHES ZERO NET ENERGY.

02:04:48.848 --> 02:04:50.549
AND THEN OF COURSE REDUCING

02:04:50.616 --> 02:04:55.955
LOCAL HER HEAT I. WELL I. IN

02:04:56.021 --> 02:05:00.693

BETWEEN US IN DOING THAT IN IS

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:46.625
IT HAPPENING OR WHAT ARE THE

EXISTING AUTHORITIES IN

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:56.728
JURISDICTIONS BUT HAVE NEVER

02:08:56.795 --> 02:08:59.731
BEEN ATTEMPTED. TO BE BONDED

02:08:59.798 --> 02:09:01.767
TOGETHER AS A AS A UNIQUE CHAIN

02:09:01.834 --> 02:09:04.069
SO YOU NEED TO. PERMITS WOULD

02:09:04.136 --> 02:09:06.071
ADD DISTRICTS WITH THE US EPA

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.739
FOR THE INJECTION WHILE WITH

02:09:07.806 --> 02:09:10.542
CITIES WITH COUNTIES WITH-

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:12.010
POSSIBLY STATE LANDS COMMISSION

02:09:12.077 --> 02:09:13.479
IF YOU GONNA BE BUILDING A

02:09:13.545 --> 02:09:14.713
PIPELINE SO IT'S A IT'S A

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.116
CONVOLUTED. REGULATORY PICTURE

02:09:17.182 --> 02:09:18.383
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:20.385
LOOKED AT IMPLEMENTATION

02:09:20.452 --> 02:09:22.588
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

02:09:22.654 --> 02:09:25.491
HAVE YOU DONE ANY MODELING ON

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:27.426
OUR CURRENT CAP AND TRADE

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:29.661
GETTING US THERE VERSUS. A

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:32.731
CARBON TAX OR OTHER MEANS OF.

02:09:32.798 --> 02:09:35.968
MAKING THIS PENCIL OUT IN AGAIN

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:38.337
KEEPING IN MIND THE URGENCY. OF

02:09:38.403 --> 02:09:40.639
THE CRISIS WE CAN'T WORK

02:09:40.706 --> 02:09:42.274
BACKWARDS AND SAY WE DIDN'T GET

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:43.642
IT RIGHT WE CAN NEED TO GET IT

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:45.511
RIGHT SKINNER RATHER THAN

02:09:45.577 --> 02:09:49.114
LATER. YEAH WE FULLY SECOND THE

02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:50.082
IN THAT SENSE OF AND- SO MOST

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:52.151
OF THE- IF YOU SEE THE BIG

02:09:52.217 --> 02:09:53.785
PILLOW WAS. TURNING BY

02:09:53.852 --> 02:09:55.587
MESSENGER FUELS TRANSPORTATION

02:09:55.654 --> 02:09:59.291
FUELS SO ADD WASTE- FITTINGS

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:01.527
FROM FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS.

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:04.329
AND THE GREEN PORTION OF THE BY

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:05.731
JENNY PORTION OF TRASH

02:10:05.797 --> 02:10:10.402
MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE. THE BEST

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:12.437
THING TO DO WITH THOSE IS.

02:10:12.504 --> 02:10:13.305
MOSTLY TO TURN THEM INTO

02:10:13.372 --> 02:10:14.640
TRANSPORTATION FUELS NOT TO

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:16.775
GENERATE ELECTRICITY SO THE

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:19.278
NATURAL MATCH OF POLICY

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:20.646
INSTRUMENT THE CALIFORNIA

02:10:20.712 --> 02:10:22.481
ALREADY HOUSE IS THE LOW CARBON

02:10:22.548 --> 02:10:24.850
FUEL SAN. AND THIS IS THE OF

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:25.884
THE HIGH VALUE PROPOSITION

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:27.252
RIGHT NOW FOR DEVELOPERS AND IT

02:10:27.319 --> 02:10:29.388
ALSO HAPPENS TO BE WHERE THE-

02:10:29.454 --> 02:10:30.989
THE MOST STUBBORN SOME OF THE

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:32.357
MOST AUBURN EMISSIONS HAPPEN

02:10:32.424 --> 02:10:33.892
TO. TWO WEEKS SO WE THINK THAT

02:10:33.959 --> 02:10:36.128
THIS IS THE BEST USE FOR THAT

02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:42.301
RESOURCE. THANK YOU. SO I HAVE

02:10:42.367 --> 02:10:45.037
A NUMBER OF A QUESTION FOR THE

02:10:45.103 --> 02:10:47.439
FOR THE FIRST ONE IS. ARE WE

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:51.810
LOOKING AT. NEGATIVE EMISSIONS

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:54.012
AFTER COMPLIMENTS OR AS A

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:55.681
REPLACEMENT TO SOME OF OUR

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:58.917
REDUCTION POLICIES WE HAVE NOW

02:10:58.984 --> 02:11:02.020
YES MISTER PRESS NO ABSOLUTELY

02:11:02.087 --> 02:11:03.822
AS A COMPLIMENTS WE NEED TO GO

02:11:03.889 --> 02:11:05.691
FLAT OUT ON ALL THE ON GOING

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:07.559
MITIGATION EFFORTS AND AS MISS

02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:09.928
JANET GOALS OUTLINED WE NEED TO

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:11.697
COME UP WITH NEW WAYS TO

02:11:11.763 --> 02:11:13.332
ACCELERATE AND DEEPENED THOSE

02:11:13.398 --> 02:11:15.601
MITIGATION EFFORTS. THE

02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:16.735
NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AT SOME OF

02:11:16.802 --> 02:11:18.704
THE WE PRESENT OUR WHAT WE

02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:20.973
THINK WILL BE NEEDED ON TOP SO

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:23.408
THIS IS BY NO MEANS SETTLED THE

02:11:23.475 --> 02:11:24.476
CHECK THE CLOSE THE DOW IS WHAT

02:11:24.543 --> 02:11:26.678
WITH LOOKING JUST TO BE CLEAR

02:11:26.745 --> 02:11:30.249
HELLO FOLKS GET OURSELVES HERE

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:31.516
NATALIE. THANK YOU SO THEN THE

02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:32.884
OTHER PART ABOUT YOUR REPORT

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:35.220
TALKS ABOUT THE COOL BENEFITS

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:36.922
TO OUR QUALITY OUT THERE WHICH

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:37.923
IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN

02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.890
LOOKING OUT FOR A LONG TIME I

02:11:38.957 --> 02:11:40.626
LIVE. UP IN I LIVE IN ONE OF

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:41.660
THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:11:41.727 --> 02:11:43.829
WHERE I'M- 5% MOST POLLUTED

02:11:43.895 --> 02:11:47.199
ERA. OF THE- OF THE STATE AND I

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:48.700
HAVE THE LUXURY OF MY OPEN

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:51.236
SPACES THE RIVER BED THAT'S OF

02:11:51.303 --> 02:11:52.771
CONCRETE JUNGLE NEXT TO THE

02:11:52.838 --> 02:11:54.806
FREEWAY. I'M NOT ALWAYS SURE

02:11:54.873 --> 02:11:56.108
GOING FOR A WALK IS THE

02:11:56.174 --> 02:11:57.109
HEALTHIEST FOR ME EVEN THOUGH I

02:11:57.175 --> 02:11:58.910
NEVER SEEM TO GET ENOUGH THAT

02:11:58.977 --> 02:12:02.414
SENT. TO MAKE HERE AND SO CAN

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:04.583
YOU QUE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:07.052
ABOUT AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:11.456
TASTE IS THAT. WHAT BY THAT. IN

02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:13.959
THE I GET THIS CALL THE- NO

02:12:14.026 --> 02:12:15.694
IT'S THIS POINTS BUT WE SEE THE

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.963
VERY CLEARLY THE- BIO FUELS WE

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:20.265
CREATE FROM THE WAIST BY MASS

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:22.901
WOULD REPLACE FOSSIL FUELS ON

02:12:22.968 --> 02:12:24.369
THE ROAD SO IF YOU'RE REPLACING.

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:26.772
DIESEL FOSSEL THE WITH

02:12:26.838 --> 02:12:28.740
HYDROGEN. THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE

02:12:28.807 --> 02:12:30.509
EQUITY BENEFIT THE ROAD FROM

02:12:30.575 --> 02:12:33.078
HEAVY TRUCKING. IF WE CAN DO

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:34.012
AWAY WITH THE PRACTICE OF

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:35.914
BURNING WOODS WHICH HAPPENS IN

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:39.017
BOTH AGRICULTURAL AREAS BUT

02:12:39.084 --> 02:12:40.719
ALSO AS A RESULT OF. EITHER

02:12:40.786 --> 02:12:45.590
INTENTIONAL OR A WILDFIRE THAN.

02:12:45.657 --> 02:12:46.958
WE'VE SEEN WHAT THOSE DAYS CAN

02:12:47.025 --> 02:12:48.727
ACTUALLY DO IN IN THE FALL FIVE

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:50.662
SEASON IF WE CAN TAKE THAT.

02:12:50.729 --> 02:12:51.396
THAT BURNING AWAY TO SOME

02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:53.865
EXTENT AND STERN AND TO CLEAN

02:12:53.932 --> 02:12:56.068
TRANSPORTATION FUELS AGAIN WE

02:12:56.134 --> 02:12:57.402
SEE A DIRECT BENEFIT.

02:12:57.469 --> 02:12:59.004
SYLLABUSES BE TRUE WERE

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:01.406
DISABILITIES. WOULD BE LOCATED

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:03.108
IN THESE COMMUNITIES THEY ALSO

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:05.944
SEE. IMPROVEMENTS ARE WHERE

02:13:06.011 --> 02:13:07.279
THEY CONTINUE TO. MAYBE WILL

02:13:07.346 --> 02:13:09.414
CONTINUE TO CARRY AN UNDUE

02:13:09.481 --> 02:13:11.550
BURDEN FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

02:13:11.616 --> 02:13:13.518
ABSOLUTELY SO THE HAVE THE BY A

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:14.986
CONVERSION FACILITIES THAT WE

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:16.588
HAVE TALKING OF BEEN NO

02:13:16.655 --> 02:13:19.691
RELATION TO THE- BIOMASS PLANTS

02:13:19.758 --> 02:13:21.560
OF THE PAST THE WE'VE COME TO

02:13:21.626 --> 02:13:22.327
KNOW ALL TOO WELL IN WHICH

02:13:22.394 --> 02:13:24.763
BECAUSE A- VERY MARKET IMPACT

02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:26.665
ON ON THAT QUALITY. THIS IS A

02:13:26.732 --> 02:13:27.733
COMPLETELY NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:29.534
DOES NOT SUFFER FROM THE- FROM

02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:31.903
THE SAME POLLUTION PROBLEMS AND

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:36.208
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. A

02:13:36.274 --> 02:13:37.609
GENERATION OF PLANTS THAT HAS

02:13:37.676 --> 02:13:43.949
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. SO

02:13:44.015 --> 02:13:45.917
YOU WOULD EXPECT SEE YOU EXPECT

02:13:45.984 --> 02:13:48.019
THAT WE WOULD HAVE. SEEN OUR IN

02:13:48.086 --> 02:13:49.788
DC DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:51.256
WIDE THAT COOL BENEFITS

02:13:51.323 --> 02:13:53.692
EXPECTED. BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:56.194
SURE YET I THOUGHT BECAUSE WHEN

02:13:56.261 --> 02:13:57.729
WE DID AB THIRTY TWO. WE SAID

02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:59.231
THAT WE WERE GONNA GET CLEANER

02:13:59.297 --> 02:14:00.699
AIR AND TEN YEARS LATER WE SAW

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:01.967
THAT THAT WASN'T TRUE AND SO

02:14:02.033 --> 02:14:03.435
WHAT WE ACCEPT A LOT OF GREAT

02:14:03.502 --> 02:14:05.537
CALL BENEFITS. THIS WEBER FELT

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:07.806
IT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE- BUT

02:14:07.873 --> 02:14:09.875
WE WERE WE ALL PAY INTO THE

02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:11.843
SYSTEM ON AND SO I JUST AMONG

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:13.745
ALL THE LITTLE HAS A TEN OF

02:14:13.812 --> 02:14:15.914
ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE NOT

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:17.816
QUANTIFIED. RELEASES THIS

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:21.253
ADVICE COMMUNITIES OUT THERE.

02:14:21.319 --> 02:14:22.587
SO IT WOULDN'T LOOK NO ANALYSIS

02:14:22.654 --> 02:14:24.423
THE ERROR THE WOODS. IMPROVED

02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:26.591
OUR A FREEWAYS SO HEAVY ROADS

02:14:26.658 --> 02:14:29.161
TRY. AND PASSENGER CARS. AND

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:31.029
ALSO AREAS WHERE FARMING IS

02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:31.963
PREVALENT SO THE CENTRAL

02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:33.865
VALLEY. WOULD BE A DIRECT BEEN

02:14:33.932 --> 02:14:34.666
OFFICIALLY IN THESE HAPPEN TO

02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:37.736
COINCIDE. PRETTY WELL WITH THE

02:14:37.803 --> 02:14:40.705
MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:42.541
AND FROM THE PILOTS AYE AYE A

02:14:42.607 --> 02:14:43.975
MAYBE MY KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED

02:14:44.042 --> 02:14:45.844
BUT I'VE I'VE LOOKED INTO THE

02:14:45.911 --> 02:14:46.745
CARBON CAPTURE AND

02:14:46.812 --> 02:14:47.979
SEQUESTRATION AT DIFFERENT

02:14:48.046 --> 02:14:50.081
TIMES AND WE'VE HAD DIFFERENT

02:14:50.148 --> 02:14:51.516
SMALLER SCALE PILOTS BUT WHERE

02:14:51.583 --> 02:14:52.684
I'VE SEEN IT HAS I'VE SEEN IT

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:55.587
IN CONJUNCTION WITH. BILL AND

02:14:55.654 --> 02:14:57.522
HAS BEEN OF RECOVERY AND WHICH

02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:59.524
SEEMS TO BE CONTRARY TO WHAT WE

02:14:59.591 --> 02:15:00.358
WANT TO FOUR FOUR ARTICLES

02:15:00.425 --> 02:15:05.230
HERE. ON AND SO. IS SCALABLE IT

02:15:05.297 --> 02:15:06.264
HAD AND CAN WE AFFORD THIS IS

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:07.899
IT SEEMS TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:09.367
TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD AND SO I

02:15:09.434 --> 02:15:11.102
THINK THOSE BACK TO MR MUNNINGS

02:15:11.169 --> 02:15:12.871
QUESTION JUST TRYING TO FIGURE

02:15:12.938 --> 02:15:15.240
OUT. YOU KNOW HOT. HOW DO WE

02:15:15.307 --> 02:15:17.142
GET THERE HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT.

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:18.677
YES SO THIS IS BY NO MEANS

02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:21.513
PREDICATED ON ANY REVENUES FROM

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:23.048
INJECTING CO TWO AND GETTING

02:15:23.114 --> 02:15:25.717
ADDITIONAL ALLOWS. THE CAPACITY

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:27.118
ESTIMATES THAT WE PRODUCED IN

02:15:27.185 --> 02:15:29.654
OUR REPORT. THE SOLELY AND

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:32.224
ROCKS- INDEPENDENT OF ANY OIL

02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:33.725
GAS PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA

02:15:33.792 --> 02:15:35.594
HAS BEEN BLESSED WITH IN A

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:37.529
TRULY EXCEPTIONAL. DEEP YOUNG

02:15:37.596 --> 02:15:39.464
BASINS THAT OF. THE RIGHT

02:15:39.531 --> 02:15:41.199
PROPERTIES TO TRAVEL CO TWO AND

02:15:41.266 --> 02:15:43.168
A LOT OF SPACE MANY CENTURIES

02:15:43.235 --> 02:15:45.904
WORTH OF SPACE. TO KEEP ITS AND

02:15:45.971 --> 02:15:47.873
ACTUALLY THE- TRANSPORTATION AN

02:15:47.939 --> 02:15:48.807
INJECTION COSTS IS A IS A VERY

02:15:48.874 --> 02:15:50.809
SMALL FRACTION. OF THE TOTAL

02:15:50.876 --> 02:15:51.843
WITH THE WITH THE REAL

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:54.012
EXPENDITURES WAS REQUIRED AS

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:55.914
AND BUILDING THE BY MASS

02:15:55.981 --> 02:15:58.116
CONVERSION PLANTS NOT.

02:15:58.183 --> 02:16:01.620
TRANSPORTING THE CO TWO ASTORIA.

02:16:01.686 --> 02:16:15.267
THERE. OKAY WELL THEN IT LOOKS

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:16.167
LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE WORKED

02:16:16.234 --> 02:16:17.402
REALLY HARD WITH ME THANK YOU

02:16:17.469 --> 02:16:20.539
TO GET A START AT THIRTY FIVE

02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:21.106
FOUR TWENTY SEVEN OZ SO WITH

02:16:21.172 --> 02:16:23.008
THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL

02:16:23.074 --> 02:16:23.909
FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION I LOOK

02:16:23.975 --> 02:16:25.877
FORWARD TO THE ONGOING

02:16:25.944 --> 02:16:27.679
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE DIRECTION

02:16:27.746 --> 02:16:30.148
WE MOVE IN IS AND ALWAYS CARE

02:16:30.215 --> 02:16:31.550
BUT THE SENSE OF URGENCY AT

02:16:31.616 --> 02:16:32.751
THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ALL OF US

02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:34.019
IN THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO BE

02:16:34.085 --> 02:16:35.787
CREATIVE AND HAVE A HOLD. OF A

02:16:35.854 --> 02:16:38.323
SUITE OF ITEMS THAT WE LOOK AT-

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:40.926
ALONG THE WAY WITH REDUCTIONS-

02:16:40.992 --> 02:16:42.527
BEING OUR ULTIMATE GOAL HERE SO

02:16:42.594 --> 02:16:44.396
WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU

02:16:44.462 --> 02:16:45.997
WE WILL BE HAVING A SERIES OF

02:16:46.064 --> 02:16:47.265
HERE HE'S HEARINGS THROUGHOUT

02:16:47.332 --> 02:16:48.466
THE YEAR THAT WILL BE LOOKING

02:16:48.533 --> 02:16:51.636
AT DIFFERENT TOPICS ALL THANK

02:16:51.703 --> 02:16:53.471
YOU PUBLIC COMMENT ON. I THINK.

02:16:53.538 --> 02:16:55.440
COMMENT I APOLOGIZE. YOU HAVE

02:16:55.507 --> 02:16:56.675
ALL THE TIME YOU NEED DON'T

02:16:56.741 --> 02:16:58.777
COLLECT AND I NEED TO CUT YOU

02:16:58.843 --> 02:16:59.311
OFF I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:01.513
BEING. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:02.814
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO THE

02:17:02.881 --> 02:17:03.682
AYE LEVIN WITH THE BIO ENERGY

02:17:03.748 --> 02:17:05.083
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND I

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:06.451
WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR

02:17:06.518 --> 02:17:08.286
HOLDING THE HEARING AND THE-

PANELISTS FOR THE GREAT WORK

02:17:08.954 --> 02:17:10.555
THAT THEY'RE ALL DOING. IT

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:11.723
MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE

02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:12.724
REPRESENTING THE BUYER WINTERS

02:17:12.791 --> 02:17:13.792
HE SAYS HE'S IN CALIFORNIA BUT

02:17:13.858 --> 02:17:15.060
I JUST WANNA SAY UP FRONT THERE

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:17.295
ARE GOOD AND BAD PROJECTS. INTO

02:17:17.362 --> 02:17:19.731
YOUR QUESTION MADAM CHAIR. AND

02:17:19.798 --> 02:17:20.832
THERE ARE WAYS THAT BIOENERGY

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:22.334
CAN PROVIDE MUCH GREATER

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.468
BENEFITS FOR AIR QUALITY AND

02:17:23.535 --> 02:17:24.769
CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOCAL

02:17:24.836 --> 02:17:26.771
COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. AS WE

02:17:26.838 --> 02:17:28.306
MOVE FORWARD TO GET TO THE

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:29.341
HUNDRED ARE SORRY EIGHTY THREE

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:30.742
MILLION METRIC TONS THAT MISTER

02:17:30.809 --> 02:17:32.077
PERRY DOS TALKED ABOUT THE BIO

02:17:32.143 --> 02:17:33.678
ENERGY. CAN PROVIDING CARBON

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:35.714
NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. WE NEED TO

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:36.982
FOCUS ON COMMUNITY SCALE

02:17:37.048 --> 02:17:39.150
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY BIOENERGY

02:17:39.217 --> 02:17:41.119
THAT'S ONLY USING ORGANIC WASTE

02:17:41.186 --> 02:17:42.621
WE SHOULD BE GROWING FOOD.

02:17:42.687 --> 02:17:46.191
CROPS THE PURPOSE OF ENERGY

02:17:46.257 --> 02:17:46.958
PRODUCTION WE SHOULD BE TAKING.

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:50.895
HELP THREE. BREAST PRODUCTION.

02:17:50.962 --> 02:17:51.963
WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH WASTE

02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:52.530
THEY WERE EITHER BURNING OR

02:17:52.597 --> 02:17:54.132
LAND NOW THAT CAN BE USED FOR

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:55.900
ENERGY WE ALSO SHOULD BE

02:17:55.967 --> 02:17:57.168
FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY SCALE

02:17:57.235 --> 02:17:59.004
FACILITIES THERE'S NO REASON TO

02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:00.405
HAVE ENORMOUS UTILITY SCALE

02:18:00.472 --> 02:18:01.940
FACILITIES THAT REQUIRE

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:03.775
TRANSPORTING ORGANIC WASTE OVER

02:18:03.842 --> 02:18:05.277
LONG DISTANCES USUALLY WITH

02:18:05.343 --> 02:18:07.412
DIESEL POWERED TRUCKS- AND

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:08.413
FINALLY WE SHOULD BE USING

02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:10.081
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

02:18:10.148 --> 02:18:12.150
COMBUSTION BURNING LOGS SHOULD

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:14.452
HAVE GONE OUT WITH CAVEMEN WE

02:18:14.519 --> 02:18:15.987
HAVE MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:17.355
THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE

02:18:17.422 --> 02:18:19.557
IN USE IN CALIFORNIA NOW SO IF

02:18:19.624 --> 02:18:20.925
IT'S FOOD WASTE TO PROCESSING

02:18:20.992 --> 02:18:22.827
WAY STARING THE NEWER WE SHOULD

02:18:22.894 --> 02:18:24.129
BE USING ANAEROBIC DIGESTION

02:18:24.195 --> 02:18:25.797
WHICH ALSO CAN PRODUCE DIGEST

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:27.332
DATE. WHICH CREATES THE HIGHES

02:18:27.399 --> 02:18:28.800
VALUE CLEANEST COMPOST

02:18:28.867 --> 02:18:31.603
AVAILABLE IF IT'S WOODY WASTE

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:33.271
REMOVED FOR WILDFIRE REDUCTION

02:18:33.338 --> 02:18:34.906
OR AGRICULTURAL WASTE WALNUT

02:18:34.973 --> 02:18:36.608
SHELLS THINGS THAT HAVE NO

02:18:36.675 --> 02:18:38.043
OTHER ALTERNATIVE VALUE OR THE

02:18:38.109 --> 02:18:39.010
WOOD WASTE CURRENTLY GOING TO

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:41.112
LANDFILLS WE CAN GAS OF AYE IT

02:18:41.179 --> 02:18:42.681
AND PRODUCE BOTH ENERGY AND BIO

02:18:42.747 --> 02:18:43.581
CHAR WHICH CAN PROVIDE

02:18:43.648 --> 02:18:46.051
PERMANENT CARBON SEQUESTRATION

02:18:46.117 --> 02:18:47.352
THESE ARE MUCH CLEANER MORE

02:18:47.419 --> 02:18:48.887
EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES WITH A

02:18:48.953 --> 02:18:50.822
LOT OF BENEFICIAL BY PRODUCTS

02:18:50.889 --> 02:18:51.990
THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO MOVE TO

02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:54.659
DO THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:56.528
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SMALL SCALE

02:18:56.594 --> 02:18:59.431
BY WHAT SHE PROGRAMS IS THE BIO

02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:00.632
MAT PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATE A

02:19:00.699 --> 02:19:04.569
STATE LET'S JUST TEN SB. ELEVEN

02:19:04.636 --> 02:19:05.136
TWENTY TWO. IT REQUIRES TO

02:19:05.203 --> 02:19:06.104
FIFTY MEGAWATT. SMALL BY

02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:07.505
WINNERS FACILITIES BUT

02:19:07.572 --> 02:19:08.740
CALIFORNIA'S TECHNICALLY

02:19:08.807 --> 02:19:10.141
AVAILABLE ORGANIC WASTE COULD

02:19:10.208 --> 02:19:11.810
BE PRODUCING FIVE TO SIX

02:19:11.876 --> 02:19:12.977
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. OF NEW

02:19:13.044 --> 02:19:15.046
SMALL SCALE BIOENERGY SO WE

02:19:15.113 --> 02:19:16.414
NEED TO INCREASE THAT.

02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:17.482
REQUIREMENT AND WE NEED TO

02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:18.550
SPREAD IT NOT JUST AMONG THE

02:19:18.616 --> 02:19:19.751
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT

02:19:19.818 --> 02:19:20.719
SINCE MORE MORE OF OUR

02:19:20.785 --> 02:19:21.986
ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM

02:19:22.053 --> 02:19:23.555
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS.

02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:25.190
AND PUBLIC UTILITIES ALL

02:19:25.256 --> 02:19:26.191
ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDER

02:19:26.257 --> 02:19:28.126
SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SHARE IN

02:19:28.193 --> 02:19:30.395
THAT PROGRAM. AND WE NEED TO

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:31.663
ACCELERATE INTERCONNECTION IT'S

02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:33.465
WAY TOO HARD TO GET NEW

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:35.100
BIOENERGY EVEN SMALL SCALE

02:19:35.166 --> 02:19:37.435
BIOENERGY. THAT'S CRITICAL EVEN

02:19:37.502 --> 02:19:38.570
UTILITIES IS THAT IT'S CRITICAL

02:19:38.636 --> 02:19:39.938
TO MAKE MICROGRAPHS MORE

02:19:40.004 --> 02:19:42.140
RESILIENT AND LONGER DURATION.

02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:43.508
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:45.543
PUT IT IN THE PIPELINE AND ON

02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:47.112
THE TRANSMISSION LINES IT TAKES

02:19:47.178 --> 02:19:48.847
YEARS TO CONNECT THESE NEW

02:19:48.913 --> 02:19:50.682
SMALL SCALE BIOENERGY PROJECTS.

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:51.916
TO THE ELECTRICITY GRID ON THE

02:19:51.983 --> 02:19:54.252
PIPELINE GRIT. AND WE SHOULD BE

02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:55.320
PUTTING MORE FUNDING INTO THESE

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:57.655
PROGRAMS. AND THERE IS JUST NO

02:19:57.722 --> 02:19:58.523
WHERE NEAR ENOUGH FUNDING

02:19:58.590 --> 02:20:00.391
CONSIDERING THESE ARE NOT ONLY

02:20:00.458 --> 02:20:01.359
CRITICAL TO ACHIEVE OUR

02:20:01.426 --> 02:20:02.894
CHEMICALS BUT ACCORDING TO THE

02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:03.895
LA THEY'RE ALSO THE MOST COST

02:20:03.962 --> 02:20:05.597
EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS. AS MANY.

02:20:05.663 --> 02:20:08.233
OF ANY OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:10.101
REDUCTION FUNDED PROGRAMS. THE

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:11.402
BIO ENERGY RELATED PROGRAMS ARE

02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:12.904
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE ON

02:20:12.971 --> 02:20:16.141
AVERAGE INTENT. COST OF ALL

02:20:16.207 --> 02:20:18.777
TIME. I THE STATE. SO THEY MAY

02:20:18.843 --> 02:20:20.145
FROM EVERY SEMI THE LAST THING

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:21.012
I WANT TO MENTION IS COMMUNITY

02:20:21.079 --> 02:20:22.580
RESILIENCE I KNOW THAT'S A BIG

02:20:22.647 --> 02:20:24.516

LEGISLATION- ON BOND. WINNER

02:20:28.319 --> 02:20:30.722
GEE IF IT'S LOCAL ORGANIC WASTE

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:33.525
GOING TO LOCAL ENERGY SUPPLIES

02:20:33.591 --> 02:20:36.227
CAN REALLY REAL INCREASE LOW

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:38.997
COMMITTEE RE. AND PROVIDE

02:20:39.063 --> 02:20:41.966
THIRTY WITH NOT A LEVEL NGUYEN.

A PILOT IT RIGHT NOW ALL THE

02:21:06.691 --> 02:21:09.194
RESEARCH IS BEING DONE- MOBILE

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:12.997
SCALABLE- BIO ENERGY THAT CAN

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:14.899
CREATE AND SEQUESTER BIO CHAR

02:21:14.966 --> 02:21:17.202
IN THE FOREST ON THE AG LANDS

02:21:17.268 --> 02:21:19.370
AND EVEN YOUR LANDFILLS IS

02:21:19.437 --> 02:21:21.372
AVAILABLE TODAY THERE ARE FIVE

02:21:21.439 --> 02:21:23.541
EXISTING PROJECTS UNDER THE NET

02:21:27.278 --> 02:21:28.346
CAN DEVELOP MORE THROUGH BIO

02:21:28.413 --> 02:21:30.481
MAT DO MORE THROUGH THERE YOU

02:21:30.548 --> 02:21:32.550
CAN EXPEDITE CITING BY USING

02:21:32.617 --> 02:21:34.352
THE NAM PROGRAM BUT WE NEED TO

02:21:34.419 --> 02:21:35.820
BE LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE

02:21:35.887 --> 02:21:38.356
SOLUTIONS AND AGAIN BALANCING

02:21:48.132 --> 02:21:49.234
BE IN CITIES AND ELSEWHERE TO

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:51.769
THAT REDUCING THE THERE WE HAVE

02:21:51.836 --> 02:21:53.972
TO ENSURE THE HEALTH OF THOSE

02:21:54.038 --> 02:21:56.741
LANDS THE PROJECTS ARE WHAT

02:21:56.808 --> 02:21:57.609
WHAT DOES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY

02:21:57.675 --> 02:21:59.310

ABOUT FOUR YEARS NOW OUT OF LA

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:05.777
ACTS- THERE'S GREAT DEMAND

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:07.378
AMONG THE AIRLINES FOR THOSE

02:23:07.445 --> 02:23:08.846
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

02:23:08.913 --> 02:23:11.249
TRULY CONTRIBUTE. TO THE ACTION

IS THERE'S A LOT OF A RONI

02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:05.502
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FORCE

MANAGEMENT BEING BANDIED ABOUT

02:39:07.004 --> 02:39:10.007
HERE- THERE'S A- HIGH DEGREE OF

02:39:10.073 --> 02:39:12.476
AMNESIA. FORGETTING WHAT'S

HAPPENED TO CALIFORNIA'S

02:39:13.043 --> 02:39:15.379
FOREST'S. SEEMS TO BE A TOTAL

02:39:15.445 --> 02:39:16.947
ABSENCE TO REMEMBER IN THE PULP

02:39:17.014 --> 02:39:18.148
MILLS FOR INSTANCE THAT WERE ON

02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:19.316
HUMBOLDT BAY THAT I GREW UP

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:23.086
WITH. AND THE DEVASTATION THAT

02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:23.654
OCCURRED IN THE FORCE IN THE

AND CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE TREAT.

02:39:27.791 --> 02:39:31.361
AS FEEDSTOCK. FOREST DEBRIS

02:39:31.428 --> 02:39:33.897
MATTERS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IF

02:39:33.964 --> 02:39:35.666
IT IS THAT WE WANT TO TAKE CARE

02:39:35.732 --> 02:39:37.067
OF OUR FORCES THAT THEY SERVE

02:39:37.134 --> 02:39:38.502
US IN RESPONDING THE CLIMATE

02:39:38.568 --> 02:39:40.037
CRISIS WE NEED TO STORED OUR

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:42.072
FORCE SO FOR INSTANCE THE FACT

02:39:42.139 --> 02:39:44.875
THAT RAINBOW RIDGE GOT LOGGED

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:46.877
LAST SUMMER. AND RAINBOW RIDGE

02:39:46.944 --> 02:39:49.413
OF COURSE PROPERTY THAT BELONGS

02:39:49.479 --> 02:39:50.714
TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:51.949
STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL

02:39:52.015 --> 02:39:54.651
HUMBLED REDWOOD COMPANY. THIS

02:39:54.718 --> 02:39:57.454
HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO THAT

02:39:57.521 --> 02:39:58.889
THERE WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR

02:39:58.956 --> 02:40:01.491
FORCE. BUT I DO WANT TO BRING

02:40:01.558 --> 02:40:02.659
UP ANOTHER TOPIC THAT'S REALLY

02:40:02.726 --> 02:40:04.661
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S IN MY ROLE

02:40:04.728 --> 02:40:05.762
THE BIO FEEL WATCH I

02:40:05.829 --> 02:40:07.898
PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERNATIONAL

02:40:07.965 --> 02:40:09.466
COALITION CALLED HANDS OFF

02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:11.601
MOTHER EARTH. THERE'S A NUMBER

02:40:11.668 --> 02:40:14.171
OF GROUPS AND THE GLOBAL SOUTH-

02:40:14.237 --> 02:40:15.872
THE CLIMATE JUSTICE ALLIANCE

02:40:15.939 --> 02:40:16.573
FROM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES

02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:19.977
IS INVOLVED. WE'RE WORKING WITH.

02:40:20.043 --> 02:40:20.577
FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD ON

02:40:20.644 --> 02:40:22.713
THIS. AND WHAT HASN'T BEEN

02:40:22.779 --> 02:40:24.948
MENTIONED HERE BASICALLY IS A

02:40:25.015 --> 02:40:25.983
GREAT DEAL OF WHAT WE'VE

02:40:26.049 --> 02:40:27.451
DISCUSSED TODAY IS GEO

02:40:27.517 --> 02:40:30.787
ENGINEERING. DIRECT AIR CAPTURE

02:40:30.854 --> 02:40:34.124
IS SPECIFICALLY A GEO

02:40:34.191 --> 02:40:36.727
ENGINEERING TECHNIQUE BIO

02:40:36.793 --> 02:40:39.596
ENERGY WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND

02:40:39.663 --> 02:40:40.831
SEQUESTRATION BETTER KNOWN AS

02:40:40.897 --> 02:40:43.567
BACKS. IS GEO ENGINEERING. AND

02:40:43.633 --> 02:40:45.335
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SAY

02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:47.371
THAT TODAY AND IT'S I THINK

02:40:47.437 --> 02:40:48.438
IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S

02:40:48.505 --> 02:40:49.539
BEEN HAPPENING AT THE AIR

02:40:49.606 --> 02:40:51.341
RESOURCES BOARD AS WELL IT

02:40:51.408 --> 02:40:51.942
HAPPENED AT A NUMBER OF THE

02:40:52.009 --> 02:40:53.977
CARBON NEUTRALITY WORKSHOPS

02:40:54.044 --> 02:40:56.079
LAST YEAR. A THESE REFERENCES

02:40:56.146 --> 02:40:57.414
THESE EUPHEMISMS TO ARTIFICIAL

02:40:57.481 --> 02:40:59.016
SEQUESTRATION OF MECHANICAL

02:40:59.082 --> 02:41:02.953
SEQUESTRATION AND DIRECT. IT'S

02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:05.255
LIKE THESE MACHINES THAT WANNA

02:41:05.322 --> 02:41:06.556
BE INVENT THIS IS GEO

02:41:06.623 --> 02:41:08.859
ENGINEERING AND SO WE NEED TO

02:41:08.925 --> 02:41:12.229
BE TRANSPARENT AND SPEAK AND

02:41:12.295 --> 02:41:13.897
LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THE

02:41:13.964 --> 02:41:14.498
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:16.566
ENTERTAINING THE IDEA. OF

02:41:16.633 --> 02:41:21.304
EMBARKING UPON GEO IN NEARING.

02:41:21.371 --> 02:41:22.672
SO I BELIEVE. YOU KNOW I THINK

02:41:22.739 --> 02:41:23.874
THAT'S RISK. OF ELECTED

02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:25.442
OFFICIALS TO ENSURE THAT WERE

02:41:25.509 --> 02:41:27.644
BEING FULLY TRANSPARENT. WITH

02:41:27.711 --> 02:41:29.179
THE PUBLIC- THERE'S A LOT OF

02:41:29.246 --> 02:41:29.813
DANGERS WITH THESE

02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:32.949
TECHNOLOGIES- ALONG WITH THESE

02:41:33.016 --> 02:41:34.718
TECHNOLOGIES FOR INSTANCE THE

02:41:34.785 --> 02:41:36.953
CREATION OF SALE OF CELLULOSIC

02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:38.755
BIO FUELS WOULD BE THE

02:41:38.822 --> 02:41:40.791
SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY THAT'S

02:41:40.857 --> 02:41:42.192
REQUIRED TO COULD BE EVEN IN

02:41:42.259 --> 02:41:44.327
GENETIC LEE MODIFY TREES. OR

02:41:44.394 --> 02:41:45.962
ALSO WITH THE MICRO ORGANISMS

02:41:46.029 --> 02:41:48.198
THAT ARE REQUIRED SO THESE

02:41:48.265 --> 02:41:49.066
THESE ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT

02:41:49.132 --> 02:41:50.267
TOPICS THAT CAN GET TOUCH UP

02:41:50.333 --> 02:41:52.202
TODAY SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:41:52.269 --> 02:41:54.271
THAT AS YOU MOVE FOR TALKING

02:41:54.337 --> 02:41:55.872
ABOUT. NEGATIVE EMISSIONS WHICH

02:41:55.939 --> 02:41:57.007
ARE REALLY NEGATIVE EMISSIONS

02:41:57.074 --> 02:41:58.375
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'RE

02:41:58.442 --> 02:42:00.143
TRANSPARENT AMONGST OURSELVES

02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:01.411
AND WITH THE PUBLIC THE

02:42:01.478 --> 02:42:03.447
CALIFORNIA IS NOW ENDEAVORING

02:42:03.513 --> 02:42:08.285
TO. EXPLORE GEO ENGINEERING AS

02:42:08.351 --> 02:42:08.819
A RESPONSE TO THE CLIMATE

02:42:08.885 --> 02:42:15.459
CRISIS. GET AFTER MADAM CHAIR

OBVIOUSLY THE CENTER FOR

02:42:27.637 --> 02:42:28.805
BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OUR

COMMITTEE TO START TACKLING

02:42:41.551 --> 02:42:44.154
THOSE INDIVIDUAL PIZZAS. MANY

02:42:44.221 --> 02:42:46.690
OF THEM HAVE. BENEFITS

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:47.357
POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR

02:42:47.424 --> 02:42:48.892
COMMUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUAL

02:42:48.959 --> 02:42:51.595
HOMES AND FOR OUR NATURAL ON

02:42:51.661 --> 02:42:53.964
WORKING LANDS THE ALL THAT HAVE

02:42:54.030 --> 02:42:56.466
THEN ADDITIONAL CO BENEFITS FOR

02:42:56.533 --> 02:43:00.003
THINGS LIKE WILDLIFE WATER

02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:01.938
ETCETERA. MANY OF THOSE ARE NO

02:43:02.005 --> 02:43:03.206
REGRETS IN THAT WE SEE THOSE BY

02:43:03.273 --> 02:43:04.474
HAVE AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE

02:43:04.541 --> 02:43:07.377
WAYS THAT- THAT THE PLANTING

02:43:07.444 --> 02:43:09.946
MORE TREES ON OUR ON OUR

02:43:10.013 --> 02:43:11.781
STREETS ARE NOT GOOD AND ALL OF

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:12.682
THE BENEFITS OF SPRING ARE

02:43:12.749 --> 02:43:13.817
GOING TO HAVE NEGATIVE

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:16.753
CONSEQUENCES THAT HAVE TO- BE

02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:17.888
CONSIDERED. IN ORDER TO

02:43:17.954 --> 02:43:20.290
DETERMINE WHAT THE CARBON

02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:23.326
IMPACT IMPACTS ARE. FORREST

02:43:23.393 --> 02:43:25.095
SOURCED WOODY BIOMASS IS NOT

02:43:25.162 --> 02:43:27.464
ONE OF THOSE NO REGRETS-

02:43:27.531 --> 02:43:29.833
ISSUES. FOR SERVICE WITH THE

02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:32.569
BIOMASS CARBON IMPLICATIONS ARE

02:43:32.636 --> 02:43:34.971
VERY PROJECT SPECIFIC SITE

02:43:35.038 --> 02:43:38.008
SPECIFIC AND PROCESS SPECIFIC.

02:43:38.074 --> 02:43:40.143
AND SO. THOSE A SUMP BE

02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:41.311
ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT BE

ARCHING- CONCEPTS OF THE OF THE

02:43:48.218 --> 02:43:50.554
GENERAL SCALE. ARE NOT GOING TO

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:51.721
NECESSARILY APPLY AT THE

PROJECT LEVEL THAT YOU HAVE THE

02:43:56.493 --> 02:43:59.796
ACTUAL CARBON IMPACTS SO WE

02:43:59.863 --> 02:44:01.731
LOOK FOR TO MANY HERE ON MANY

DIVERSITY. ALSO WE ALSO BELIEVE

02:44:23.186 --> 02:44:24.821
IT IS TIME TO DISCUSS NEGATIVE

02:44:24.888 --> 02:44:26.556
EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES WHILE THE

02:44:26.623 --> 02:44:27.857
STATE CONTINUES TO PUSH FOR

02:44:27.924 --> 02:44:29.226
REAL CARBON. PRODUCTION

02:44:29.292 --> 02:44:30.994
REDUCTIONS. THERE'S A STRONG

02:44:31.061 --> 02:44:32.128
POTENTIAL TO CONTINUE TO

02:44:32.195 --> 02:44:33.430
SEQUESTER AND ENHANCE

HAVE WITH A COUPLE OF

02:44:47.877 --> 02:44:49.145
TECHNOLOGIES MENTIONED IN THE

02:44:49.212 --> 02:44:50.847
CARBON I GET A REPORT. FIRST

02:44:50.914 --> 02:44:52.482
WITH THE REPORT IS FAR TOO

02:44:52.549 --> 02:44:53.583
GENEROUS TO THE BY MASS

02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:55.752
INCINERATION INDUSTRY. TODAY

THE EXISTING INDUSTRIES NET

02:44:56.987 --> 02:44:58.955
EMITTER OF CARBON AS WELL AS A

02:44:59.022 --> 02:45:00.323
SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LOCAL AIR

02:45:00.390 --> 02:45:02.125
POLLUTION INCLUDING IN SOME. IN

02:45:02.192 --> 02:45:03.860
SOME OF THE MOST POLLUTED

02:45:03.927 --> 02:45:04.828
PLACES IN THE STATE.

02:45:04.894 --> 02:45:06.029
ADDITIONALLY BIOMASS

02:45:06.096 --> 02:45:07.464
GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY IS

02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:09.099
BARELY DEVELOPED IS NOT I CAN

02:45:09.165 --> 02:45:12.102
MAKE ALL THE- ALTHOUGH A LOWER.

02:45:12.168 --> 02:45:13.403
THAN CONVENTIONAL BYPASS AND

02:45:13.470 --> 02:45:18.341
CENTER. IT WILL BE A- FOR THE

02:45:18.408 --> 02:45:20.377
STATE PURSUE A QUE. OR MORE.

02:45:20.443 --> 02:45:21.177
ONE PULL ALL. EXIST FOR

02:45:21.244 --> 02:45:23.113
HANDLING FORCED WASTE. WE HAVE

02:45:23.179 --> 02:45:24.781
PRODUCED A REPORT AVAILABLE ON

02:45:24.848 --> 02:45:26.116

THE DIRECTION OF CARBON CAPTURE

02:45:33.456 --> 02:45:34.858
AND STORAGE THAT REQUIRE

02:45:34.924 --> 02:45:36.293
INJECTION AS PROMOTED IN THE

REPORT WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN

02:45:37.827 --> 02:45:39.262
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T

02:45:39.329 --> 02:45:41.431
JUST BECOME AN OFFSET. TO ALLOW

02:45:41.498 --> 02:45:42.699
OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS IN THE

STATE TO CONTINUE BUSINESS AS

02:45:44.401 --> 02:45:46.136
USUAL. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE

02:45:46.202 --> 02:45:47.570
SURE THAT CARBON INJECTION IS

02:45:47.637 --> 02:45:49.172
NOT LINKED TO SEISMIC EVENTS

02:45:49.239 --> 02:45:50.440
AND WE NEED TO INJURE ENSURE

02:45:50.507 --> 02:45:51.808
THE ANY INJECTION OR AIR

PRODUCE CLEAN ELECTRICITY. FOR

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:01.631
EVEY CHARGING STATIONS IN THE

02:49:01.698 --> 02:49:03.366
STATE- THERE'S ANOTHER PERIL

02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:04.667
HERE AND THE DAIRY INDUSTRY'S

02:49:04.734 --> 02:49:07.036
PART OF THAT CIRCULAR ECONOMY-

02:49:07.103 --> 02:49:08.037

RECYCLERS OVER 40% OF THE FEED.

02:49:13.643 --> 02:49:14.911
WE USE IN THE CALIFORNIA THEIR

02:49:14.978 --> 02:49:16.746
INDUSTRY TODAY. COMES FROM

OTHER AGRICULTURAL BYPRODUCTS

02:49:18.615 --> 02:49:19.482
ALMOND HOLES ARE A GREAT

02:49:19.549 --> 02:49:22.218
EXAMPLE WE EAT THE NUTS. THE

02:49:22.285 --> 02:49:24.153
SHELLS CAN GO FOR BIOMASS THE

02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:25.922
HOLES ARE GREAT CATTLE FEED.

02:49:25.989 --> 02:49:27.090
AND ALLOW US TO REDUCE OUR

02:49:27.156 --> 02:49:29.726
CARBON FOOTPRINT SIGNIFICANTLY-

02:49:29.792 --> 02:49:31.628
UC DAVIS IS WORKING ON A-
