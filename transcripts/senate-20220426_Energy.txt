BEFORE WE HEAR THE PRESENTATION ON THE BILLS- WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE RIGHT INTO- OF PRESENT A PRESENTATION OF BILLS- WORKING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. OF THE COMMITTEE. IN ORDER TO HEAR TESTIMONY ON THE BILLS SO WE WILL BEGIN BY AT LEAST. TRYING TO ESTABLISH. BY BY- TAKING THE ROLE OF CLEAR COULD YOU CALL THE ROLL OF. WESSEL PRESENT WAS A PRESENCE DOLLY. DAHLE THE PRESENCE BAKER GONZALEZ. GROW HERTZBERG MCGUIRE HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR FROM SENDER LAYERED ON ITEM NUMBER ONE S. B. TEN TWENTY WELCOME SENATOR BEGIN. WHEN YOU'RE READY MEMBER- I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE- FOR THEIR WORK AND COMMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS ON THIS BILL AND COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE PENDING APPROVAL TODAY CLEAN ENERGY JOBS AND AFFORDABLE AFFORDABILITY ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THIS IS A BIG BILL AND I AM GOING TO TAKE TIME TO DESCRIBE. ITS JOINT WE AUTHORED BY THE SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM SENATORS CABALLERO AND ARE ALSO AND MYSELF TO GIVE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC. CLIMATE COMMITMENTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME TO PLACE RATE PAYER AFFORDABILITY ARE AT THE CORE OF OUR ENERGY POLICY. S. B. AT TEN TWENTY CONTAINS SEVERAL KEY ELEMENTS TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES. FIRST THE BILL WOULD ADD INTERIM TARGETS TO THE POLICY FRAMEWORK OR- QUESTION. R. BY SENATOR DAY WE OWN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN UNDER SB ONE HUNDRED THE STATE'S COMMITTED TO ACHIEVE A 60% RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO BY TWENTY THIRTY TO CREATE NEW AND STATE JOBS AND TO REQUIRE THAT A SUPPLIED BY ZERO CARBON RESOURCES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. S. B. TEN TWENTY ADS TRUMP TARGETS TO REQUIRE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCES TO SUPPLY 90% OF ALL RETAIL ELECTRICITY SALES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND 95% OF ALL RETAIL ELECTRICITY SALES BY. FORTY ME JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN AT LEAST ONE LETTER THAT SAYS THIS ACCELERATES GOALS. THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING GOALS THIS JUST SETS IN TERM GOALS TO MARK HOW WE ARE GOING TO STEP UP TO THEM SO THERE'S NO ACCELERATION. OF BUT IT IS INTRAMURAL AND THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH THE INTEGRATED RESOURCES PLANNING GOALS RECENTLY ADOPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THE RESULTS OF SB ONE HUNDRED MODELING PERFORMED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ENERGY COMMISSION AND CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THE INCLUSION OF INTRUM TARGETS WILL ENSURE THAT THE STATE MAKE STUDY AND ACCOUNTABLE PROGRESS TOWARD FULL DECARBONISATION OF CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY GRID. SECOND THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE ALL STATE AGENCIES TO RELY ON A CARBON RESOURCES. TO SERVE THEIR OWN FACILITIES BY TWENTY THIRTY AGENCIES AT THE FOREFRONT OF EFFORTS O DECARBONIZE THE GRID AND DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP BY EXAMPLE. IT ALIGNS WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES- TO OBTAIN A 100% CARBON FREE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY NO LATER THAN TWENTY THIRTY AT A MINIMUM CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES SHOULD MATCH ANY COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD NOW TO. IT ALSO ALIGNS WITH COMMITMENTS MADE BY CALIFORNIA'S TWO LARGEST A PUBLIC UTILITIES ARE SMUD AND THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER SO UNDER S. B. TEN TWENTY STATE. BE ENCOURAGED INSTALL URBAN RESOURCES ON LEISTER ON BUILDINGS AND TO WORK WITH THEIR LOAD SERVING ENTITIES SECURE CLEAN RESOURCES DEVELOPED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. THIRD THE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A CLIMATE AND EQUITY TRUST FUND TO ADDRESS RISING ELECTRICITY RATES THAT THREATEN THE AFFORDABILITY OF BASIC SERVICE AND OUR MIND THE ECONOMICS OF BENEFICIAL BILL TRANSPORTATION BACK FOR CASH. TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY AND DECARBONISATION COMMITMENTS ARE NOT AT CROSS PURPOSES WITH AFFORDABILITY SB TEN TWENTY WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW STRUCTURE FOR CHANNELING FUNDING FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES. OFFSET A VARIETY OF COSTS CURRENTLY COLLECTED IN UTILITY RATES. OCHI CONSIST WITH THE JOINT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES I MENTIONED THE ENERGY COMMISSION PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AN INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. CONTAINED IN A SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR. IT ALSO TRACKS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS PRESENTED BY A WIDE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS AT THE PUC'S RECENT AFFORDABILITY ON BALK. THE TRUST WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AFFORDABLE DECARBONISATION AUTHORITY A NEW NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION WITH DISBURSEMENTS REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION FOR PUBLICLY OWNED. UTILITY SERVICE TERRITORIES AND THE OF PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY SERVICE TERRITORY. THE CREATE TRUST WOULD DEMONSTRATE A LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO LOWER ELECTRICITY RATES ESPECIALLY FOR MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WHO STRUGGLE TO PAY THEIR MONTHLY BILLS ONCE THE TRUST IS ESTABLISHED IT SHOULD BE ENDOWED WITH LONG TERM FUNDING COMMITMENTS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. AND THE LAST THE BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE BETTER INFORMATION SHARING AND COORDINATION ON TRANSMISSION PLANNING TO AUTHORIZE THE PC AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL AND USUALLY MARKET INFORMATION TO THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. IN ORDER TO SPEED UP AND STREAM CITING AND CONSTRUCTION OF TRANSMISSION. THE PER WAS. AN S. ONE HUNDRED JOINT AGENCY RECOMMENDATION. TAKEN AS A WHOLE- OF THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO BRING NEW TERM RIGOR TO CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK ELECTRICITY SECTOR CLEAN ENERGY AND ZERO CARBON TARGETS TO FOCUS ON THE AFFORDABILITY OF MEETING TARGETS AND TO MAKE OTHER CHANGES TO LAW NEEDED. STATE SCHOOLS BOB IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE ENVIRONMENT BY ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA TURNED THE CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN THE CENTER FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY AND NUMEROUS OTHER GROUPS HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS DAN JACOBSON FROM ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA AND MATTHEW FRIEDMAN FROM TURN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU AND WILL- ALLOW- NINETY SECONDS FOR EACH- SPEAKER BEGINNING WITH DAN JACOBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAN JACOBSON A SENIOR ADVISER TO ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA WE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THE S. B. TURNED TWENTY AND WANT TO THANK OUR THE AUTHOR AND ALL THE OTHER AUTHORS WHO HAVE JOINED ON IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. FIRST AND FOREMOST CLEAN ENERGY IS HERE AND IT LOOKS WHEN SENATOR SURE PASSED THE FIRST SB TEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE CALIFORNIA WAS GENERATING LESS THAN 3% OF ITS ELECTRICITY FROM CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES. NOW THANKS TO THE HARD WORK THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN OTHERS THE STATE IS ON A PATH TO A 100% CLEAN ENERGY IT WAS WIDELY REPORTED ON APRIL THIRD OF THIS MONTH. THE CALIFORNIA WAS GENERATING NINETY SIX POINT 7% OF ITS ENERGY FROM CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES AND IT WAS ONLY FOR A FOR A FEW BRIEF MOMENTS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE HOW MUCH ENERGY AND HOW MUCH- PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE ON THIS. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT AS THE SENATOR HAS POINTED OUT WE'RE NOT ACCELERATING THE R. P. S. YEAR WE'RE JUST SHUDDERING INTERIM TARGETS AND THE REASON THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE IT ADDS CONSISTENCY AND IT MAKES FOR AN ORGANIZED PROCESS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE STEPS IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT FINAL GOAL OF GETTING TO HONOR. PERCENT YOU WOULDN'T ALL OF YOUR RETIREMENT MONEY FOR THE LAST YEAR OF YOUR WORK TO TRY TO SAY LET'S GET IT ALL IN THERE YOU HAVE THE SAME KIND OF BENCHMARKS AND THE SAN. AND FORWARDED THIS BILL. EXACT I'M KIND OF CLEAR THINKING EXTRA QUESTIONS TO BE ABLE TO. THIS REASON AT THIS BILL IS SHOWING. IS BECAUSE THE STATE AGENCIES TO SORT OF WALK THE TALK IF CALIFORNIA'S GONNA LEAD ON THIS ISSUE. WE NEED THE STATE AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING. AND FINALLY SETTING UP THIS CONNECTION OF CREATING AFFORDABILITY AND CLEAN ENERGY IS CRITICAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TOP THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS NOW WILL MOVE- TO. MATTHEW FRIEDMAN NINETY SECONDS ON THE CLOCK PLEASE SIR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATT FRIEDMAN I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE UTILITY REFORM. I'M HERE TODAY TO OFFER. SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL TEN TWENTY. WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE SENATE CLIMATE WORKING GROUP AND SENATOR LAYERED. TO DEVELOP A PACKAGE OF CLEAN ENERGY DECARBONISATION AND AFFORDABILITY POLICIES THAT WILL CEMENT AND EXPAND CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP. THE BILL BRINGS TOGETHER SEVERAL IMPORTANT POLICY ELEMENTS INTO A SINGLE PACKAGE. AND ESTABLISHES THE PRINCIPLE THAT CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO CLEAN ENERGY AND A DECARBONISE. USKO AND IN IT. FOR THE FIRST TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE ALIKE. RATES FOR CAL. CAN SB TWENTY FEELS IMPORTANT GAPS IN THE SB ONE HUNDRED ZERO CARBON POLICY FRAMEWORK BY ADDING INTERIM BENCHMARKS OF 90% BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. 95% BY TWENTY FORTY. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO ACHIEVE THE 100% ZERO CARBON TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY. ESTATE AGENCIES ARE ALREADY OBLIGATED UNDER EXISTING LAW AND THEY REPRESENT ABOUT 324% OF STATEWIDE ELECTRICITY USE. I'M AND AS NOTED BY SENATOR LAYERED THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN'S OWN COMMITMENT THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WILL GET THERE BY TWENTY THIRTY. FINALLY SB TEN TWENTY ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL CHALLENGE OF KEEPING ELECTRICITY RATES AFFORDABLE IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS OF AFFORDABILITY THAT IS BEING FACED BY CUSTOMERS TODAY. SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC AND SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAVE SEEN THEIR RATES GO UP BY FIFTY PERCENT. IT'S BEEN ABOUT A 30% INCREASE IN JUST THE LAST TWO YEARS. THESE HIGH RATES HOW ARE HUGE CRUSHING BURDEN ON CUSTOMERS THEY ALSO HAVE ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE THEY SLOW CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS ON BUILDING A TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION THANK YOU. SO FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT THE CLIMATE EQUITY TRUST CONCEPT AND WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT COME UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU GO TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR COMMENTS AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE JUST TAKE A POSITION.

WE ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES FROM FOOD AND WATER WATCH THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. TO BE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS HOWEVER YOU MUST FIRST. CLOSE AT TWENTY UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO ADDRESS THE CONTINUED INCLUSION AND ENTRENCHMENT OF ENERGY GENERATED FROM GLUTEN DAIRY AND DAIRY. AS A RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCE AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCE. YOU CAN EXPECT INSTRUMENTS WITH THE INCLUSION OF DIGEST GOT. ELIGIBLE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCE SPECIFICALLY AND ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE CLEAN ENERGY SOURCE GENERALLY. ARE CONCERNED AREGROUNDED IN THE EXPERIENCE OF READING FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. JERRY YOU WERE LOOK TO CONCENTRATE. ENERGY PER FROM DERRY. THE PRODUCT OF THE DUST JERRY IF THEY WANT VALLEY WHICH CONTAMINATE THE AIR AND WATER UP LOW INCOME-COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WHAT WHAT MINORITY REACHES INTO INTO GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATING DRINKING WATER SOURCES FOR GENERATIONS TO COME I JUST KNEW WERE APPLIED TO LANDFALLING DIGESTION CONTAINS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MY TRADE AT THE NEW YORK CREDAI JOSH. I JUST CAPABLE PRODUCER AIR POLLUTION AND GREEN GAS EMISSIONS. WHILE GAS PRODUCTION DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF AIR POLLUTION FROM GARY'S NOR THE METHANE FROM ENTERIC COMMISSION. IN ADDITION COMMUNITIES NEAR CAPE COAST TALK ABOUT THE TOWEL OPENERS AND FLIES THAT THE IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE IN THEIR HOME. IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS BIOGAS PRODUCTION DOES NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. INCLUDING THE DOCTOR GOT THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCE AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCE HAVE PAVE THE WAY WE WILL CONTINUE TO POLICIES THAT INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF METHANE IN THE FORM OF WEAPON IN YOUR- CURRENT POLICY ENCOURAGES PRODUCTION. DIED AFTER GOSSIP RESULTING IN THE CONCENTRATION OF HOUSING THE NEWER AND FEED RT POLLUTION BURDEN COMMUNITIES. THROUGHOUT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY GARY HERBERT'S ARE CONCENTRATING AROUND AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE DIGESTIVE JOSH WHICH IS THE OBVIOUS CONSEQUENCE OF INCLUDING PRODUCTION. OF THIS DROP. ONE POLICY. WE'RE REVIEWING THE TRUCK FUND COME OF BE TEND TO YEAH SOME QUESTIONS AND SOME CONCERNS BUT WE ARE NOT TAKING A POSITION ON THAT PORTION OF THE BILL. THAT WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE OFFERS TO ENSURE THE PURSUIT SB TEN TWENTY LAUDABLE GOALS. DO NOT DOUBLE DOWN ON A PROGRAM THAT INCENTIVIZES FURTHER CONCENTRATION JERRY HERDS. ALREADY POLLUTION BURDEN COMMUNITIES AND MONETIZES PRODUCTION OF METHANE. TOGETHER WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE ENERGY WE RELY ON TO REACH CALIFORNIA CLEAN ENERGY GOAL. IS IN FACT CLEAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR PARK TO PARTICIPATING. NOW WILL GO TO- OPPONENTS ON HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION HERE. THAT LIKE TO- OPPOSING PERSON. GO TO THE PHONE LINES NOW MODERATOR PLEASE QUEUE. OPPONENTS TO SB TEN TWENTY. THANK YOU TO STATE OPPOSITION TO SB TEN TWENTY ME PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE. MS FOR OPPOSITION THE TERM TWENTY. WE HAVE ONE LINE WITH AN OPERATOR WE JUST A LITTLE. LINE THREE OH NINE THREE OH NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS RICHARD MARX AND FOR THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION BUT UNDER THE LAYERS GONZALEZ DID NOT EXPLAIN SEVENTY FIVE. THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS MANDATE. WE'D LIKE TO WORK FOR THE PATIENT THAT. LANGUAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ARE SPEAKER. THANK YOU KNOW FOR THE LINES AND IN OPPOSITION. OKAY- NOW WILL- COME TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENT. MY ONLY COMMENTS ARE I SUPPORT POLICY GOALS OF THIS BILL I'D BIKE THE DIRECTION IT'S MOVING. AND IF IT IS. AT ALL THE- YOUR DECISION I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A AS A CO AUTHOR FEED SO CHOOSE- DOWN THE LINE IS AS YOU MOVE FOR WITH THE BILL- DO WE HAVE ANYBODY IN THE COMMITTEE ELECTIONS. OKAY WHAT DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. I DO ACTUALLY THAT OKAY. SO LOOK THERE'S A LOT IN THIS BILL AND I. HAVING A BEER WHEN THEY PASSED SB. WHAT ONE HUNDRED I THINK IT WAS DALY OWNS BILL AND SO. TWO QUESTIONS ONE HOW THE FOR ABILITY PIECES SOMETHING THAT I AM VERY FOCUSED ON BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE CAN'T LEAD IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVE ENERGY RATES ARE FOR WHICH WE DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE FORMAL INVIGORATES IN AND IT'S- DESTROYING. THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOMES OR- HOURLY WAGE EARNERS RIGHT NOW THAT'S THAT'S THE CASE. AND SO- WHAT IT WAT'S YOUR VISION FOR HOW IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO. YOU KNOW STABILIZE OUR- OUR ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY RATES THE VISION HAS AND ONLY FOR RESIDENTS ARE NOT NOT ONLY FOR RESIDENTIAL BUT FOR COMMERCIAL BECAUSE COMMERCIALS. WERE WE CAN'T CMPETE- IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN CLOSE WITH OTHER STATES AND WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF THAT MANUFACTURING IN THOSE TYPES OF JOBS OUT OF OUR STATE AND THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. WELL THE OF THE FOCUS AT THIS POINT IS ON RESIDENTIAL BUT WE WILL HAVE CONVERSATIONS OVER TIME THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT WE'VE PUT A LOT OF THE EXPENSES OF FORTY CARBONATE SESSION ON TO THE ELECTRICITY RATES. AND SO THE IDEA OF THE TRUST IS THAT WOULD LOWER RATES. ARE FOR EVERYONE BUT ESPECIALLY DO AN EXTRA. A PIECE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE AT LOWER MODERATE INCOMES AND THE IDEA IS TO EASE EXACTLY THE CONCERN THAT YOU RAISED. AND THIS WOULD NEED TO BE FUNDED IN THE PROJECT BUT IT REALLY EXPRESSLY SAYS THAT IT CAN COME FROM ANY OF A NUMBER OF SOURCES WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL FUNDS. ARE- THE G. GRF FUNDS TO GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THE GENERAL FUND OF THAT WE CAN TRY TO GET THERE WITH ANY FUNDING SOURCE THAT IS POSSIBLE TO FUND THE TRUST. AND AN APPLIED. TRY THEN THAT IF THERE WERE OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF DECARBONISATION IT COULD FIT WITHIN THE TRUST BUT ARE THE PRIMARY FOCUS AT THIS POINT IS ON THE RICH. SO I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SPOT I DON'T. NOT A BILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL I THINK THAT THE AND REASON BEING IS THAT. WE DON'T WE BASICALLY. HAVE PASSED OFF THE WE'VE WE'VE FOR STABILIZED IF YOU CAN SAFELY SAY THAT WORD THE RESIDENTIAL RATE ON THE BACKS OF THE COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL RATE THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING CALIFORNIA AND IF YOU'RE TAKING A PART OF MONEY TO HELP STABILIZE THOSE. LOWER INCOME FOLKS IT'S STILL A PART OF ME THAT COMES FROM SOMEWHERE TO TAX BASE OR IT'S A IT'S A V. SOMEWHERE ELSE WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING INTO THE FUNDS SO. I'M TRYING TO GET MY MIND AROUND HOW WE ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST TAKEN FROM ONE POT PUT INTO ANOTHER THEN THAT'S HOW I ENVISION THIS HAPPENING IS I'M TRYING TO GET WHAT YOUR GOAL I MEAN I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO. RATE LOWER THE RATES AT THE SAME TIME DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. I UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF IT BUT THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS OF ACTUALLY OUT THAT. HAPPENS AND WHERE THE WHERE THE MONEY FLOWS FROM HONG KONG THAT'S- WHY I WAS TRYING TO GET MORE CLARIFICATION BUT- YOUR SPIRIT SOUPS TO FIFTIES. SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY SAYING THAT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. INDUSTRIAL RATES OR COMMERCIAL RATES. YOU'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT RESIDENTIAL RATES. SEVEN ANALYSIS THE QUESTION I'M ASKING IS ONLY BECAUSE YOU LET YOUR DRESS AND YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS IF YOU WILL. THAT'S OKAY UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES YOU CAN WE CAN JUST CUT YES SO WE CAN- WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE TABLE AND I'D LIKE YOU TO MAYBE ANSWERS QUESTION YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS SHOULD BE SEARCHES THANK YOU ARE TWO MAJOR THINGS AND CLOSE. A. N. THAT IS NOT REARRANGING THE PIE ON THIS IS BRINGING NEW RESOURCES TO THE ELECTRIC RATES TO DEAL WITH IT AND WE WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK OVERTIME TO SEE WHERE THAT GOES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS A PRIORITY WE DEAL WITH WITH INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR ELECTRICITY RATES. AND THEN WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT AS IT MOVES ALONG BUT BUT IT IS BRINGING REVENUE INTO THE HELP WITH THE RATES TO DOESN'T EXIST NOW SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE ARE RANGING FROM ONE PERSON OR ONE ENTITY A BOOK WILL. OVER THIS IS THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THE COURT WILL WHERE IS THAT MY- THE SAYING COMES FOR. WHO WEARS THAT POT IT'S FROM IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DESCRIBED IT IS. GENERAL FUND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FEDERAL MONEY ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WE CAN GATHER IT TO DO WHICH IS SOME WE'VE NEVER DONE SO THIS IS THIS WHICH IS WHY I DECIDE. ASIDE FROM THE- I THINK WHAT WAS IT THE TWO BILLION THAT WE SET ASIDE TO HELP WITH THE- OR WAS IT. SOMEBODY CORRECT ME TWO BILLION. THAT WAS TO HELP PEOPLE THAT WERE STRUGGLING WE HIGHWAYS LITTER UTILITY BILL THAT'S FIRST TIME STATE TO RETURN THAT. THAT I KNOW OF. AT EAST IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS OR- IF EVER. SO. IT'S A GOOD THING THAT WERE ABLE TO HELP A LOT OF STRUGGLING FAMILIES IT COULD AFFORD BILLS. BUT IT'S A BAD THING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DO BECAUSE OUR RATES ARE HIGH SO THIS BILL ATTEMPTS. TO ADDRESS. THE RATES AND ALSO RAISE MONEY- ON THE TRUST FUND TO HELP WITH THAT SO. LAUDABLE GOALS DID YOU WANNA ARE I HAD A SECOND POINT IN MY CLOSE IN THE SECOND POINT WHEN YOU SPEAK TO THE TESTIMONY R. K. AS DEALS THE GOALS AND ESTABLISHING A- OF. OUR CLIMATE TRUST DEALING WITH ELECTRICITY RATES IT AND DEALING WITH CITING TRANSMISSION IN AN EASIER WAY. AND THERE WAS A CONCERN. THAT THE UNDERLYING POLICY WITHIN SB ONE HUNDRED SHOULD BE CHANGED AS PART OF THIS. A TO DEAL WITH DAIRIES AND IT'S OUR THIS DOES NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. WHAT QUALIFIES. IN THE EXISTING Y. AND IF IT IF THERE'S A DESIRE FOR THAT CHANGE THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR ANOTHER BILL THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS BILL. AND THIS BILL DOES ADDRESS SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS. THAT THAT- PART OF THOSE NONPROFITS REALLY WANT TO DO WHICH IS GET A CARBON OUT OF THE AIR AT LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. GETTING MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE LOWER MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE ON ELECTRICITY RATES. AND IT'S THAT HIGH LEVEL BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. ITS MAJOR BILL ARE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WE- BOB. MOTION WE HAVE A CORE WE HAVE INSTEAD A QUORUM SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BILL. I THOUGHT ITEM NUMBER TWO S. B. TEN TWENTY SIX BY CENTER WILL KOWSKI. WELCOME SIR THIS IS A BILL RELATING TO RESIDENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AND A DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. AND MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS THE MISTER CHAIRMAN OUR COLLEAGUES I WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON- SB TEN TWENTY SIX- AND THINK THE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THAT THAT DEALS WITH YEAH I- USE AND THE PRIVACY CONCERN THAT WE HAVE SO THAT'S THAT'S- OUT. OF THE BILL. SO WHEN CONSUMERS ARE SEEKING GET A NEW APARTMENT AND THEIR- GOING AROUND THEY HAVE SOME IDEA OF FIXED. GENERAL BUDGET BUT THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW ONE THING WHEN TEY FIND THE APARTMENT IS WHAT THE ENERGY COSTS IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE IT SETS. THE THAT'S JUST NOT KNOWN SO UNDER CURRENT LAW- INTO YOU MAKE THAT COMMITMENT ON YOUR NEW APARTMENT- YOU GENERALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE BUDGET FOR. HOW WHAT THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS OF THE STRUCTURE WHETHER IT'S BEEN INSULATED WHETHER- THEY'VE GOT. SINGLE PANE WINDOWS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE- THE STAFF ANALYSIS I'M BUT- THE FIND OUT QUICKLY AND BECAUSE LANDLORDS DON'T PAY THE POWER BILLS THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THE LANDLORD TO MAKE THESE ENERGY AND SAVING EFFICIENCY UPGRADES WELL THE TED HAS NO. INCENTIVE TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS TO REPLACE AN OLD REFRIGERATOR BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TAKE THEM WITH THEM WHEN THEY LEAVE AND THIS IS WHAT THE STAFF ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT THIS SPLIT INCENTIVE PROBLEM SO THIS TRIES TO DRESS IT SO. IT EMPOWERS CONSUMERS WITH THE BASELINE INFORMATION ON WHAT THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS OF A POTENTIAL RENTAL UNIT THAT THEY HAVE- THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE BASIC ENERGY EFFICIENCY DISCLOSURE FORM BY THE LANDLORD AT THE TIME OF THIS IN THE LEAST SIMILAR TO THE REQUIREMENTS- FOR ALL RUN LEASE EXPLAINS WHY THIS THE OTHER SAYS YOU GET SINGLE PANE WINDOWS ARE INSULATED ALL THE BEST THE FURTHER IT CHARGES THE ENERGY COMMISSION WITH CREATING A RATING SYSTEM FOR LABELING OR SOME SYSTEM BY WHICH CONSUMERS WOULD KNOW IF THE RENTAL UNIT MEETS OR EXCEEDS OUR FAILS THE BASIC TENETS OF MODERN ENERGY EFFICIENCY. LEAVE THAT WILL HELP LIVE AND HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE LANDLORDS- TO SEEK OUT CALIFORNIA'S NUMEROUS ENERGY EFFICIENCY UP GRANTS AND PROGRAMS. I'M AYE RICHER AYE VOTE TODAY AS I SAID. ACCEPTING THAT. COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU AVE- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT WILL GIVE A MESSAGE. NINETY SECONDS TO GIVE THEIR PRESENTATION SUPPORT I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE ON THE PHONE LINE SO WE'LL GO WITH GREG- WHAT THE CALIFORNIA FISH TO SEE DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL FIRST IF HE IS ON THE LINE. OPEN UP THE LINE FOR MISTER WIKLER. YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GREG MCLEAN AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FISHING SCENE DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL I'M HERE IN ORDER SENATE BILL. TWENTY SIX. SO. GIVE ME A COUPLE OF THE NINE UTILITY TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING MORE THAN FIFTY COMPANIES TO DESIGN IMPLEMENT MAINTAIN AND EVALUATE ENERGY EFFICIENCY DEMAND RESPONSE WHEN EMPLOYED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WITH AN ESTIMATE BUT THAT NUMBER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE EMPLOYED IN THE INDUSTRY THAT WE REPRESENT SB TEN TWENTY SIX WOULD CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS. THE VISION P. BY GIVING SPECT. RESIDENTIAL HOUSING BRENNER. USED INFORMATION ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND POTENTIAL ENERGY COSTS AT THE PROPERTY BEFORE SIGNING A LEASE. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO CREATE AN ENERGY EFFICIENCY SIX CLOSURE FORM. REQUIRED TIME OF SIGNING OF THE LEASE AND ESTABLISHING ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO FURTHER INFORM RENTERS AS THEY MAKE HOUSING CHOICES HIS ACTIONS WILL HELP MOVE THE RENTAL MARKET SEGMENTS OR GREATER LEVELS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY LOWERING THE BILL'S. AND FURTHERING THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOAL THAT'S A GOOD THING GIVEN THAT THIS SEGMENT IS A STARKLY NOT ISSUED AT THE CONNECT AGAINST ANARCHY EFFICIENCY POTENTIAL- TEN SB TEN TWENTY AT TEN TWENTY SIX WILL HELP OPEN THE RENTAL MARKET TO GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY INCREASING TENANT. AT THE END. MISSION AND THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD REALIZING MUCH OF THIS POTENTIAL AND THAT'S HELPING IT THE CALIFORNIA SHE THAT AMBITIOUS CARBON REDUCTION GOALS. FOR THESE REASONS I ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS WILL GO NOW TO STEPHAN PABLO SOMEBODY PASS.

AT THIS NEW POLICIES. ELEVEN THERE ARE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION WHO SETS ARE POINT STANDARDS TO SET A STANDARD MORE QUICKLY ONCE THEY FIND A GOOD CAUSE KING THAT THE EX. OF A TECH. IT'S SUBSTANTIATES WHITES WARRANTED I'M SO BASICALLY THE ENERGY COMMISSION WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A GOOD FINDING BECAUSE THAT THE- STANDARD SHOULD BE EFFECTIVE SOONER THAN A ONE YEAR- DATE THIS LOT AS THEY- ASKED.

OKAY WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOW FOR MEMBERS OF ANY COMMENTS SENATOR DODD YEP- THE CENTER SKINNER CAN CAN YOU CAN HELP ME OUT WITH WHAT A GOOD BECAUSE FINE COULD BE. AS A COULD FIND IT. YOUR COULD BE DRY KIND OF SIFT THIS OUT YES- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE- SO. LET'S SAY THERE WAS A NEW ADVANCEMENT IN OUR MANY YEARS REFRIGERATION NOT BECAUSE- I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. BUT IF WE TAKE JUST THE CHANGE. IN APPOINT STANDARDS FOR TRADERS WHICH THE ENERGY COMMISSION PUT IN THE SEVENTIES THAT ALONE. DROPPED KEPT AND WE WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS CALIFORNIA'S DONE ALL THIS LEADERSHIP WHETHER IT'S IN RENEWABLE ENERGY- THERE SO THAT THE FACT THAT WE STILL USE PER CAPITA LESS ELECTRICITY. THAN WE DID IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IS BECAUSE FARPOINT STANDARDS SIMPLY NOW AS WE ADVANCED AND WE TRIED TO GET ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES AS WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT THEIR SUPER MORE BAND ON THE HEAD AND- I'M- TEND TO BE LESS. WE WANT TO GO. RELY SO WE GOTTA HAVE NICK WALKS WE AGREED WE HAVE TO REDUCE OUR USE BUT WHY SHOULD WE BE GOING AROUND TELLING PEOPLE JUST UNPLUG YOUR STUFF NO. IF THERE IF THERE ISN'T B. SPENT IN A PARTICULAR POINT THAT BRINGS ITS ELECTRICITY DRAWDOWN 25% JUST LIKE THAT AND WE'VE SEEN THAT NOW. MANY OF OUR OUR CELL PHONE CHARGERS NOW ARE HAVE CUT THEIR USAGE OR LAPTOPS. WE HAVE THAT IF WE CAN MOVE IT AND GET IT ON THE MARKET FAST. THEN IT HELPS. AND RELIABILITY. WITH ALL OUR SCHOOLS NO I COULD WATERIS A BETTER EXAMPLE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE QUITE THE SAME ANALOGY. BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE HORRIBLE DROUGHT RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE ASKING RESIDENTS TO GO BACK TO REDUCE IT JUST TURN OFF FOR YOUR WATER OR WHAT IF. ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT DEVICES JUST USED 25% LESS WATER BUT WERE JUST AS EFFECTIVE. THEN IT WOULDN'T JUST BE ON OUR MEMORY TO TURN THIS OR THAT OFF RIGHT. SO THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF A BILL LIKE THIS IS IF AND WE'VE SEEN. ADVANCEMENTS COME VERY FAST AND IF THEY DO AND THEY CAN HELP US ADDRESS A CRITICAL PROBLEM OTHERS ARE DROPPED. THE GRID RELIABILITY YOU NAME IT AND WE WANT TO USE. I REQUEST THEN. WHEN COMPANY COMES OUT WITH THE- ADVANCE WELL LET'S SAY IT SAVES 45% OF THE ENERGY RIGHT. I MEAN. I GUESS I GUESS THE ONE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IF YOU STARTED THE STATE- YEAH IF THE CC WHAT THROUGH THAT PROCESS RIGHT IT SAID HEY WE NEED TO DO THIS AND YOU ONLY HAVE ONE MANUFACTURER IF YOU READ OTHER MANUFACTURERS THAT- WERE CUT OUT OUT OF THE MARKET MAYBE THAT'S HEY YOU KNOW YOU SNOOZE YOU LOSE. BUT I'M INTERESTED YOUR THOUGHTS ARE WELL USUALLY IT'S NOT. ON USUALLY IT'S A REFINEMENT IN SAY. I'VE BEEN GOING TO STRUGGLE HERE IT'S THREE IT'S A REFINEMENT IN. THE PART OF THE- IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT THE SINGLE COMPANY WHO MANUFACTURES SAY THE- BIG SCREEN TV OR THE REFRIGERATOR COMES UP WITH IT IT'S THAT THE INNOVATORS IN WHATEVER THAT TECHNOLOGY IS BATTERY TECHNOLOGY STATE OR CHARGING TECHNOLOGY THEY COME UP WITH THE INNOVATION AND THEN IT SUPPLIED TO STAND TO IT'S THE STANDARD THEN APPLIED. SO BECOMES PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE. OKAY I JUST WANTED A COMMENT I THINK THIS BILL UP I THINK THERE A LOT OF BILLS LIKE THIS THAT- ON'T POTENTIALLY SEND MARKET SIGNALS SEVERAL COURAGE PEOPLE TO INNOVATE. IF THEY REALLY KNOW THEIR THEIR PRODUCTS WILL WILL GET TO. A BETTER POSITION WITH CONSUMERS AND I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL. I THINK IT'LL REALLY HELP IN THAT REGARD AND BENEFITS BUT NO NO HARM DONE RIGHT SO- BUT I. DEFINITELY HAVE POTS. POSITIVE X. MARKET AND- HELP US GET TO WHERE WE'RE HEADED SO- IF THEY'RE NO FOR THE CALMEST ONE MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS ON. I THINK WEAVER WE'VE JUST HAD A GOOD LOCATION SO I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR AND I DEFINITELY WILL TALK CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS AND WHATEVER CONCERNS THEY- THE RIGHT. THE COMMISSION YOU KNOW THE THEY WOULDN'T JUST BE MAKING SURE FINDING AND JUMPING AHEAD TO THE POOR PEOPLE CAN'T MEET IT WILL MOVE ITS ITEM FOR NOW IS B.

SHIP IF YOUR VEHICLE TO FOR TO FUEL THE OPERATION SUPPORTS IT'S A VERY FLEXIBLE FUEL. OUT WE'VE HAD DIFFERENT. I MEAN YOU KNOW GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER WAS A HUGE OUT OF HYDROGEN BUT AT THAT POINT WE'RE PRODUCING MOST FOR HYDROGEN FROM FOSSIL FUELS DID NOT REALLY GIVE US MUCH. BETTER I'M IN PORT. EVEN IN THEIR- IF YOU WHEN YOU THOUGHT ABOUT. WHAT ITS INPUT WAS. NOW WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN FROM WE'RE ALREADY WE'RE NOT POLLUTING JUST IN THE PRODUCTION AND THEN IN THE USE OF IT THE BRILLIANCE OF IT IS LIKE TO SAY IT'S IT REPLACING DIESEL IN A LONG TRUCK. IN GOOD MOVEMENT AND WE DON'T HAVE PARTICULAR DON'T HAVE THAT POLLUTION THE DETAILS BUT WE NEED TO SEND THE RIGHT MORE SIGNALS TO BRING DOWN THE PRICE. TO GET THE INNOVATION THAT WE KNEW SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS IT OF ISIS OR RATHER IT VANCE'S GROUP. BY THE NEW MONIES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MAKING AVAILABLE WHERE THERE WHERE IF WE WANT TO APPLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THESE HYDROGEN INVESTMENTS AND CREATE A REGIONAL HYDROGEN HUB WE HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY ON THE TABLE TO SO IT IS STUCK HIS DICK IN HYDROGEN HUB FUND TO PROVIDE STATE MATCHING MONEY TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE COMPETITIVE AND IT DIRECTS STATE AGENCIES TO ADOPT GREEN HYDROGEN INTO THEIR TO DEVELOP A ROAD MAP FOR HYDROGEN ROLL OUT IN CALIFORNIA AND THESE ARE THE TYPE OF SIGNALS THAT WILL HELP US GET THE TYPE OF RESPONSE FROM TECHNOLOGY INNOVATORS RESEARCHING DEVELOPERS YOU NAME IT AND HELP US BRING THAT PRICE DOWN AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT GEN.

ELEVEN OH NINE WHICH WILL INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF THE REMOVAL OF FOREST WASTE FROM CALIFORNIA'S BURN AREAS AND ECOLOGICALLY STRESSED PURPOSE AS WELL AS- AGRICULTURAL WASTE. SOME AMOUNT BENEFICIAL RE USE FACILITY WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL AND I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THERE ARE THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED MILLION. BONE DRY TONNES OR BT TEASE A FIRE KILLED FOREST WOULD WASTE IN CALIFORNIA LEAVING EXCESS BORIS WASTE AN OVERGROWTH MATERIAL IN THE STATE'S ECOLOGICALLY STRESSED FOREST LEAVES THE FOREST AT HIGH RISK OF MASSIVELY DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IMPEDES THE FUNCTION OF WATERSHEDS DIMINISHES WILDLIFE HABITAT AND HAS OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT TO SAY NOTHING OF THE PEARLS. OF A PROPERTY AND- THIS WOULD WASTE DECAYS AND PRODUCES CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH ACCELERATES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE CAN BE PROACTIVE IN PROTECT OUR FORESTS IN NEARBY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BY REMOVING FOREST FUELS TO PROCESS AND BIOMASS FACILITIES OR WE CAN WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT WILDFIRE BURNS IT AWAY. NEGATING THE AIR EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT COULD BE GAINED ANY EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT COULD BE GAINED- SOLUTION TO OUR DEAD END UP. BUT ALL ALSO OFFERS MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS RENEWABLE BIOMASS ENERGY PRODUCTION HOPES LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS BY REDUCING EMISSIONS OF CRITERIA POLLUTANTS BY PREVENTING OPEN AIR BURNING OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST. FORESTRY WASTE EACH YEAR BIOMASS PLANTS CUT CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS BY UP 298% COMPARED WITH OPEN BURNING IN THE AGRICULTURAL. WHEN YOU WENT PARKS THE SIX TIMES PER DAY OF PM TWO POINT FIVE RICHARD THAT FINE PARTICULATE MATTER WERE PRODUCED BY OPEN AGRICULTURAL BURNING STATEWIDE THESE EMISSIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY FORTY ATTEMPT TO MEET AIR QUALITY STANDARDS BUT ALSO FOR THEIR IMPACTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE SAN JOAQUIN ERR DISTRICT HAS. IT FROM BURNING. IN FIVE. THE GROUP POLLUTION BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT AGRICULTURAL WASTE CONVERTING AGRICULTURAL MATERIAL TO BIOMASS POWER GENERATION IS A SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE TURNITIN TO OPEN AIR BURNING AND QUITE FRANKLY IT PRODUCES ENERGY AT IT. WHICH IS US THE FLEXIBILITY ON OUR GREAT TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE IT WHEN WE NEED IT THE MOST. TO THIS END AS AMENDED S. B. ELEVEN OH NINE WILL EXTEND EXISTING BIRAM CONTRACT FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS NEW CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE A FIVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR TIME FRAME. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL REQUIRES ANY BIOMASS PLANT WITH THE NEW TEN YEAR CONTRACT TO SATISFY AIR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS AS WELL THESE PLANTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE.

AND THROUGH REGULAR FUEL REPORTING TO THE STATE AGENCIES WE KNOW THAT THESE EXISTING FACILITY. ABOUT ONE THREE. TONS WHAT WHAT LAST YEAR ALONE MUCH OF THAT IS FORCED WASTE. AND THEY'RE DOING THIS BY CUTTING CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS UP 298% WITH HIGHLY CONTROLLED EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES COMPARED WITH OPEN BURNING. AND THE BEAUTY OF USING BIO ENERGY FOR THIS PURPOSE IS THE STATE THEN GETS THE ADDED EXTRA BENEFIT CLEAN RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY ONLINE THAT BALANCES OUT OTHER RENEWABLES HELPING THE FOLLOWING SHAPE THE LOAD.

ON NEAR BURNING THE AIR IS YOU CAN SEE THE ERROR AND YOU CAN CERTAINLY FEEL IT IN YOUR LUNGS AND THAT IS THAT IT DOESN'T JUST GO AWAY JUST BECAUSE WE STOP BIOMASS THIS YEAR YOU CAN'T ALL THAT STUFF BORN OF A WAY TO MAKE ANY OF MONEY SO IT'S GOING TO BE LOCAL. I JAPAN'S WITH YOUR- BUT SERTOLI WELL I WANT TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR HAD A SIMILAR BILL A FEW YEARS BACK FOR BILL I AND THEN SB NINE A ONE WEEK WE DID SOME WORK IN THAT AS WELL I JUST SAY THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE UTILITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE PUSHING BACK ON THE BIRAM. BIOMASS IS NOT JUST. THE SWEETNESS FROM THE NINETY EIGHT PERCENT- SAVINGS OF THE MISSIONS THAT COME FROM FIRES BUT IT'S ALSO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THIS YEAR'S BEEN THE POOREST AREAS SUPPLY TO CALIFORNIA A GROWING FOR SEQUESTERS CARBON. AND BY THINNING OUT. LIVE TREES WE ARE ABLE TO LET FIRE BACK INTO OUR ECOSYSTEM AND ACTUALLY THE TREES GROW FASTER AND THE SEQUESTER CARBON AT THE SAME TIME WHEN FIRE DOES COME INTO THE AREA IT LAY DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND PARCEL- AND LEAVE THESE THE WILDLIFE THERE TO THE WAY AND I COULD DO FOR MILAN BEFORE WE SEE. THE FOR ALL THESE NOT SHE LUCK ON THIS BILL I WILL LIVE. I WOULD CO AUTHOR IF YOU'D LIKE THAT IF NOT IT DOESN'T MATTER BUT I WILL HELP YOU GET. UP TO GET A POOR I MIGHT NOT BE A HELP BUT I DO- REALLY WANT TO SEE. HOUSE IT IS REALLY A BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC- BECAUSE THE WHAT THE INCREASED WATER AS WELL WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE WATER SUPPLY I MEAN I KNOW THAT YOU. DO YOUR GEISHA DISTRICTS ARE DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THE INTERVIEW PART OF IT BUT THEY SURE LIKED WHAT DID STEVE SO WE HAD THE- FIRE LAST YEAR. ALMOST A MILLION ACRES OF DISTRICT. NOW WATERSHED IS DESTROYED FOR FIFTY TO SIXTY YEARS A MILLION YEARS. TENTERDEN FOR ACRES IS WHERE MY- SO YOU CAN DO. MATH OF HOW MANY SQUARE MILES AND ONE FIRE. WAS DESTROYED AND THAT'S THE WATERSHED THAT GOES INTO OR BILL- LAKE- WHICH WE WILL SEE FOR THE NEXT FIFTY SIXTY YEARS WE WILL BE GETTING GONE BUT- FIND THAT COMES. THE CELL. THIS BILL TO HELP PREVENT THOSE. TYPES OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE- TONIGHT THOUGH. OKAY VERY WELL DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS BY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER TURNER G. HONORED TO HAVE YOU SENATOR DOLLY- CO AUTHOR- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE GET CAUGHT UP IN TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT SOLUTION. AND WHEN I COME TO LEARN OVER THE YEARS. IS THAT EVEN EVEN MY OWN IDEAS FOR PERFECT SOLUTIONS BY MAKE A VERY MORNING I THINK I GOT THE PERFECT SOLUTION. WELL BRING TO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. ON WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS WE HAVE A- AN ENERGY GRID THAT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. AND WE HAVE A POWER PLANT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING OFF LINE IN JUST A FEW YEARS THAT PRODUCES 10% OF OUR ENERGY. SO OUR GRID WILL BE EVEN MORE UNSTABLE AND ON MY WATCH I DON'T WANT. US TO HAVE BLACKOUTS OR BROWNOUTS. WHERE ENERGY CEASES TO FLOW. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T MADE PLANS NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IT HAPPENS DURING THE HOTTEST OR THE COLDEST TIME OF THE YEAR. AND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NUMBER NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS. WE HAVE TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT FOR THINGS TO BE GREENER. AND PART OF THAT IS THAT THAT THE EXCEPT TECHNO. MAY PERFECT BUT IT'S BETTER WHAT WE RIGHT NOW AND- THE BURNING I HAVE TO. WITH SENATOR EGGMAN. WHEN OPEN AIR BURNING IS IT OCCURRING YOU CAN TASTE IT YOUR I. IT BURN AND YOU CAN FEEL IN YOUR- AND- DOESN'T. WAIT AND SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE WEIGHT THE- NEW. AND. BIOMET US WITH AN- TO ENTERED AND WE NEED IT WHEN THE WIND MAY NOT BE BLOWING AND THE SUN MAY NOT BE OUT. AND TO BE ABLE TO GET RID OF WASTE THAT THAT IS A PART OF A LIVING ON THIS EARTH AND SO IF WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY. THAT UPS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE USING BARCODE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE- CLEANING AND SCRUBBING THAT THAT THE RESIDUE THAT'S COMING UP AND THEN WILL BE DOING BETTER THAN WE DID BEFORE AND SO- WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY WE'RE GONNA OF. ASK FOR MOTION WE HAVE A QUORUM SO FOR NOW WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT BILL WERE SINGLE FUNCTIONING AS SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE- COMMITTEE ON ENERGY POLICE TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL. ASK FOR THE NEXT SPEAKER AN ITEM SIX S. B. ONE ONE. ONE NINE CENTER EARLY MONTHS THANK YOU TERM MEMBERS AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. SB ELEVEN NINETEEN SIMPLY CONFIRMS THE AUTHORITY OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO REQUIRE AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR GAS PROJECTS THAT ARE NOW BEING SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED THE P. YOU SEE CURRENT. S. IS FOR ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A REAL MAKING TO APPLY A SIMILAR PROCEDURE TO GAS PLANTS. THESE GAS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THEM IN MY DISTRICT INVENTOR FTER A GAS COMPRESSOR STATION HAS RAISED ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS AND- THE COMMUNITY AND THE GAS UTILITY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME TOGETHER TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS TO HAVE PUBLIC FORMS- MANY PEOPLE WERE UNAWARE. THAT THE PROJECT OF THE PROJECT UNTIL AFTER IT WAS APPROVED BY THE PUC'S. BY AUTHORIZING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO REQUIRE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR A NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY FIVE GAS PROJECTS WE CAN PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND MAKE SURE COMMUNITIES HAVE. AT THE TABLE. TODAY THAT'S WE HAVE HERE SO BE IT WELCOME. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB OPEN NINETEEN. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT- MARIJUANA US ON THE PHONE LINE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. MERRY YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN WELCOME ALL RIGHT WONDERFUL ROLE GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AND MY NAME IS SOPHIA ONE FEATHER AND I AM THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF VENTURA. AND I AM HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN NINETEEN BECAUSE- THE REASON PROJECT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION. TO A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPRESSOR STATION HAS CREATED A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR OUR CITY GOVERNMENT AND FOR OUR RESIDENTS. BECAUSE IN FIFTY FIVE OF PROJECT DOES NOT REQUIRED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. IS REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS NO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS TYPE PROJECT. BECAUSE WE AS A CITY GOVERNMENT HAVE TO PERFORM E. I. R. ALL THE TIME FOR OTHER TYPES OF PROJECT. FOR EXAMPLE A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE CREATING OUR BOTANICAL GARDENS WITH. PLANTS IN DOUBT DROUGHT TOLERANT PLANTS WE WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM E. R. AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO OUR COUNCIL WAS HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE LAW THANKS. SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY A GAS COMPRESSOR STATION. CAN DO SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. AND I MUST SAY I LIVE ABOUT A HALF MILE AWAY FROM THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. AND I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THIS PROCESS WAS GOING ON. WE WERE NEVER INFORMED AS RESIDENTS. BUT TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE WE WERE ACTUALLY NEVER INFORMED AT THE CITY. OR DEPARTMENTS WERE NEVER INFORMED THAT THIS TYPE OF WORK WAS GOING TO BE HAPPENING. AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO REQUIRED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS. BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING A LOT OF OTHER. PROJECTS GO. BUT NOT. THE STATIONS OR OTHER THE GAS MARKET SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL NO LONGER AFFECT MY CITY BECAUSE IT'S NOT RETROACTIVE SO THERE UNFORTUNATELY IT WON'T REALLY HELP US IN OUR SITUATION BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS TYPE OF SITUATION IF. IN OTHER COMMUNITIES SO THAT IS WHY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOUNG MAYBE NOT IN THE SYSTEMS BUT A FUTURE INSTANCES. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS WILL GO TO ANY SPEAKERS HERE IN THE ROOM IN SUPPORT. WE'LL GO TO THE PHONE LINES NOW MODERATOR IF YOU CAN Q. Q. SUPPORTERS IN SUPPORT OF S. B. ELEVEN NINETEEN.

CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT YES WE FEEL THAT IT IS NEEDED- WERE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE PC SO AS WE YELL AT IT THIS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL AND I THINK I THINK THE IMPORTANT PIECE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT CLARITY IS A GOOD THING IN ORDER TO AVOID THESE SITUATIONS WERE HAPPENING WE JUST DON'T WANT THIS TO KEEP YOU KNOW TO HAPPEN AGAIN. I'M IN OKAY IF YOU ARE OF THE MIND THAT IF YOU SCAN ALREADY THIS THEN I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE WHY THAT YOU OPPOSE THE BILL. BECAUSE FOR US IT'S JUST REASSURING LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'LL HAVE A AN ABILITY TO WEIGH IN- AS HAS BEEN SAID STATED IT'S NOT GOING TO IMPACT MY DISTRICT IN THE SITUATION THAT HAPPENED BUT IT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO. WAIT A MINUTE I AM. OKAY YOU. WE CAN MAKE A MOTION- BECAUSE WE'RE- AGAIN WE HAVEN'T STOPPED SCORM SO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS. AT WHAT JUST LIKE YOU KNOW I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION- CERTAINLY WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE. AT TO KIND OF GO OVER THAT LANGUAGE- AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY BUT- OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW I. THANKS FOR COMING BY TODAY. CAN. EIGHT THIS BILL THE BILL- IT'S ON CONSENT. BETTER NOT FULLER EITHER YOU BETTER NOT PULL IT THANKS TO A REPRESENTATIVE. WE HAVE FOR A POLICE. FIVE BILLS TO. WE'RE WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO HOLD YOUR BILL. I REMEMBER SEVEN S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO CENTER ALAN. THE BILL RELATED TO PETROLEUM PRICING WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE MEMBERS I LET LET ME JUST START BY ACCEPTING- THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO AND I JUST WANNA THANK YOUR STAFF FOR. WORKING OUT WITH US IN RECENT WEEKS- VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EVERYONE ON POTENTIAL FOR THE REFINEMENTS OF THIS POLICY. THE BILL MOVE FOR TODAY. SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE COST TO PRODUCE GASOLINE SOLD IN OUR STATE. I REQUIRES THE REFINERIES TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE AVERAGE MONTHLY PRICE THEY PAY FOR CRUDE OIL AND THE PROFIT MARGINS THAT ARE MAKING ON THE GASOLINE THAT THEY REFINE. AND SELL AND THEN COMBINING THIS INFORMATION WITH OTHER PUBLICLY THEY'RE MISSING DATA WILL PROVIDE US WITH A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHO IS PROFITING OFF OF GASOLINE SOLD IN THE GOLDEN STATE OF MAKING AND ALSO- EVALUATE MANY THE CLAIMS ARE BEING MADE BY BOTH. LOVERS AND HATERS OF THE OF THE OIL HISTORY. SO I KNOW THAT- FOLKS FAMILIAR YOU HAVE REACHED OUT TO MY STAFF AND I THE CERTAINLY REACH OUT TO YOU- I KNOWS WELL DONE YOU KNOW- THERE THERE WAS A FOUR PAGE STILL SPACE OPPOSITION THAT WE READ VERY FOR YOU. I'M AT THE- BUT YOU KNOW IN THE END OF THE DAY- YEAH THAT FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS IN THE BILL MISSED THE MARK I I'LL SAY I'M HAPPY DELETE THEM THAT'S GOING TO HELP. I THEY'VE ALSO CLEAN THAT THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INVESTIGATIONS ON OIL PRICES IN THE AND THERE'S BEEN NOTHING FANTASY- THEY'VE ARGUED THAT THE COST FOCUSES ON COST INFLATION. THOSE ARE THE BILL FOCUS ON COST INFLATION IT'S REALLY MORE THE FAULT OF GASOLINE RETAILERS- THEY'VE ALSO ASSERTED- TO STAFF- THAT- CALIFORNIA DRIVERS PAY MORE AT THE PUMP MOSTLY BECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT REQUIRES CLEANER. GASOLINE AND HAS HIGHER TAXES AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEES IN NEIGHBORING STATES. SO I'M I THINK THERE IS ABSOLUTE TRUTH TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE ARGUMENTS. OUT BUT WE ALSO KNOW WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN. THAT DOESN'T THOSE ARGUMENTS DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. RIGHT WE CAN QUANTIFY THE GAS TAX WE CAN QUANTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OUR COST INFLATION- R. AS IT WILL IT WILL BE BECAUSE WE CAN COMPARE OUR PRIDE OUR OUR PRICES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN MATCH THEM UP TO. THE HIGHER COST HERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND IN THE END OF THE DAY WE STILL KNOW THAT THERE'S A PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHEN YOU WE TAKE ALL THOSE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT THERE'S STILL A PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE PAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT FOLKS PAY ENOUGH BATES AND NO I AM I CONTINUE I REMAIN UNCONVINCED. THAT I THINK SOME SUNLIGHT ON REFINING PRICING AND PRACTICES- IS GOING TO THREATEN THE PUBLIC. I THINK THERE IS THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE HAVE A LOT TO GAIN FROM TRYING SOME MORE LIGHT ON THE ON THE PRICING STRUCTURE WHICH MEANS SO MUCH TO EVERYDAY PEOPLE. SO I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE- THAT THAT I THINK IS AT THE HEART OF THIS. DOWN INTO MY NECK OF THE WOODS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IT WAS A BIG EXPLOSION. AT THE TORRANCE REFINERY IS ONLY ABOUT SIX OR SO REFINERIES THAT ARE PRODUCING. THE SPECIAL BLEND OF GAP WE USE HERE IN SILICON. AND AND THE PRICES WENT UP SO YOU'RE BECAUSE THAT REFINERIES OFFLINE. THE PRICES WENT UP ABOUT A BUCK FIFTY A GALLON. IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE REFINERY. OUT BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS- YOKOHAMA'S PREDICTED THAT ONCE. THE REFINERY WAS BACK UP AND RUNNING THE PRICES WOULD JUST RETURN EXACTLY BACK TO NORMAL COURSE YOU'RE CORRECT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL. FLUCTUATION IN PRICES. OUT BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS. THE PRICES STATE INFLATED THEY CAME DOWN. BUT THEY NEVER CAME DOWN IT WENT UP ABOUT A BUCK FIFTY THEN THE PRICE CAME DOWN A LITTLE LESS THAN A DOLLAR. I AND FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW THE PRICES HAVE HAVE STATED. BAITED SO THIS BILL. AMONG OTHER THINGS WILL PROVIDE A CLEAR PICTURE JUST WHO'S PROFITING. AND TO WHAT EXTENT. I WOULD PROVIDE MORE SUNLIGHT IN AN INDUSTRY THAT WE KNOW IS MAKING REALLY STRONG PROFITS ALL YOU COULD DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR END. REPORTS WE'VE ALSO. VIEWING NO OPPONENTS OF ALSO FORCEFULLY ARGUED THE INFORMATION THAT WE WANNA MAKE PUBLIC WOULD ESSENTIALLY PUT. CONSUMERS AT RISK THAT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT THEY'VE BEEN MAKING. I KNOW- THEY CLEAN THAT THE DATA IS TO MARKET SENSITIVE- AND IT COULD BE USED BY CLEVER COMMODITIES TRADERS TO DRIVE UP THE COST OF GAS EVEN MORE I DON'T DISMISS THESE CLOUT THESE CLAIMS HAPHAZARDLY- BUT I WOULD KNOW IF YOU THINGS. WITH REGARD TO THIS ARGUMENT THE PRICING INFORMATION IN THE BILL. IS DATA THAT THE OIL COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY SHARED IN THE PAST WITH IN CALIFORNIA. IT STATED THERE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES ARE YOU DISCLOSE. HOLDERS IT'S ALSO DATA THAT IN VERY FORMATS OIL COMPANIES ALREADY PUBLICLY DISCLOSED IN A NUMBER OF OTHER AMERICAN STATES. I IN AND OF COURSE IT'S ALSO DATA SHARED THE WAY AFTER THE FACT IS WHEN YOU CAN ENGAGE IN VERY EFFECTIVE ARBITRAGE IF YOU HAVE REAL TIME ACCESS TO DATA. WITH REGARD TO PRICING BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MONTH OR SO AFTER THE FACT. I AND OF COURSE IT DISCLOSURE THE STATE REALLY IS THAT RISKY WE AS LEGISLATORS TO TRUST THAT ARE REGULATED IN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES TELECEL- BUT I'VE PERSONALLY SPOKEN TO LEADERSHIP BOTH THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. ARE DIRECTLY THE TRAIN GENERAL ALSO LEADERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- THEY HAVE NOT ASKED ME TO ABANDON THIS PATH AND DROP THIS BILL- IN FACT- SOME OF THE- CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. THAT THAT WE YOU KNOW THAT IF THE FOLKS OVER IN BOTH OF THOSE AGENCIES. ARE AT. WHAT DO YOU DO. REGIS CAN. DISAGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT. THAT THAT THEY'VE BEEN AT THE- OF THE TOOLS THEY NEED. I TO BE EFFECTIVE WATCHDOGS. TO ENSURE THAT THAT CONSUMERS ARE BEING ADEQUATELY PROTECTED- FROM FROM POTENTIAL PRICE GOUGING. SO- ANYHOW. KING ISSUE IT'S- IS MY AT THIS IS THE ONLY ALL ABOUT TRY TO PROVIDE SOME LIKE TO TRANSFER ON ON TO SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS OF GRAVE INTEREST TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE DRIVING PAYING MORE THAN EVER THANK YOU PEERS YOU HAVE TWO SPEAKERS AND THE DATES OR ANY COURT NICE PRESENTATIONS THAT ARE JIMMY CARTER ON THE PHONE LINE GOT IN THE CAR CONSUMER DARGAN GENE. GEN THANK STRONG WITH CALPERS YES IF UP IF- JAMIE COURT IS ON THE LINE. YOU HAVE A NINETY SECONDS I AM. PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PAYING A DOLLAR FIFTY MORE PER GALLON THAN IN- THE U. S. AND ONLY SIXTY CENTS OF THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OR FEES AND TAXES A DOLLAR FIFTY MORE PER GALLON AND THE AVERAGE COST FOR THE U. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS INFORMATION THAT WOULD PREVENT THAT WOULD ALLOW MARKET MANIPULATION IF THERE WAS THEY WOULD BE PUTTING THIS OUT TO THEIR INVESTORS IN OTHER PLACES. THEY'RE NOT GOING IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY'D BE EMBARRASSED AFTER AT AT HOW MUCH THEY'RE MAKING WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE CHARGING US FOR A DOLLAR A HUNDRED DOLLAR A BARREL CRUDE OIL FROM MANY OF THEIR LONG TERM CONTRACTS OR FOR MUCH LESS AS LOW AS FIFTY DOLLARS A BARREL FOR CRUDE OIL. AND THAT WOULD ADD UP TO A DOLLAR TWO DOLLARS ABOUT A DOWN AND PROFITS IF THAT CAME OUT THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING THE SHE THAT'S THE FOR APPRECIATE COMMENTS CIRCLE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE A THE NAY SPEAKER CHEN ANGST WITH CALLED GIVE NINETY SO.

GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS THAT CLEAR ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. RESPECTFULLY TAKEN UP OPPOSITION TO THE SP THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO OF THE BILL IS SEEKING DATA THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ANALYZED BY THE CDC AND FOUND NOT TO BE THE CAUSE OF ENERGY PRICE INCREASES IN CALIFORNIA- WE BELIEVE. THIS BILL THE NECESSARY BECAUSE DATA COLLECTION AND- STATUTORY OVERSIGHT ALREADY EXISTS IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED PYRO THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY INFORMATION REPORTING ACT. WHAT ARE- WHO'S ON THAT WAS ONLINE. KEEP KEEP UP HIS SPEAKING. TO ALLOW THE CC TO ANALYZE AND RESPOND TO SHORTAGES OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS IN THE PETROLEUM- MARKET- AND THEN POWER ALSO ALLOWED CC TO HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY ALL THE DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED WAS COLLECTED UNDER- CONFIDENTIALITY AS TO NOT GIVE A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE THE COMPANIES THAT WERE ACTUALLY SUBMITTING THE DATA AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC- THE AG HAS EXISTING AUTHORITY TO GO AFTER ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AND- TO. MARKET SPECULATORS. FOR THE FIJI CURRENTLY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PURSUE THESE CASES- SENATOR- REFERENCE THAT THIS HASN'T BEEN ANALYZED THE CDC DID ANALYZE THIS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN AT THE CALL OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM THEY CONCLUDED IN THAT REPORT AND ACT OF QUOTA HERE WITH LITTLE OR NO GROWTH DIFFERENCE IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA REFINER MARGINS WHICH IS WHAT SB THIRTY THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO IS GOING AFTER. THE CVC CONCLUDES THAT REFINER MARGINS ARE NOT THE CAUSE OF RESIDUAL PRICE INCREASES IN CALIFORNIA. OF FOR THOSE REASONS WE MIGHT MISS A RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO TO THE NEXT SPEAKER IT'S- DAVID HACKETT WITH STILLWATER ASSOCIATES. I BELIEVE IS ON THE PHONE LINE MR HACKETT YOU HAVE NINETY SECONDS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MANY MEMBERS MY NAME IS DAVID HACKETT ON THE GERMAN STOCK WATER ASSOCIATES LLC. THE TRANSPORTATION ENERGY CONSULTING COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN ARMONK ENERGY SPACE INCLUDING TWENTY FOUR YEARS LEADING STILLWATER. YOUR REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES LIKE THE CALIFORNIA MISSION- RESOURCES FOR CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL AGENCIES FROM A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES AS WELL AS US DEPARTMENT ENERGY IN THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CALIFORNIA CHOI MARK BARGER COMMITTEE. WITH REGARD TO TODAY'S ISSUE. THE GASOLINE SPOT MARKET IN CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER AND MORE VOLATILE THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THIS IS A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM IT'S BEEN WORKED OUT MANY CAR. HI SPOT PRICES DRIVE UP BOTH WHOLESALE AND RETAIL PRICES. TAXES AND FEES ARE A LOT HIGHER HEARING CALIFORNIANS AND THE DRAFT OUTRAGE. FURTHER CALIFORNIA DRIVERS HAVE PEER LOCATIONS TO FILL OUT SOME DRIVERS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO THE STILL WATERS ANALYSIS THERE ABOUT TWICE AS MANY DRIVERS PER STATION IN CALIFORNIA THE US AVERAGE. IN THE GASOLINE STATION POPULATION THE QUAN. ONE EXPECT THE HIGH PRICES WOULD ATTRACT NEW MARKET ENTRANTS WHY TALK OUT OF STATE RETAILERS LIKE WAL LONG SHE SAID. WHAT COMING TO CALIFORNIA I THINK ALL THE POINTS BECAUSE OF OUR STATE UNFRIENDLY BUSINESS CLIMATE. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IT ISN'T THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH AFTER CALIFORNIA'S. KNOCKS NOT LIKELY TO STICK TO CHANGE. THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. WILL NOW OPEN IT UP TO ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE GALLERY OR HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. ANYONE WILL GO TO THE MIND SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO. TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU HAVE A LINE OF NOT BETTER IN JUST A MOMENT PLEASE. OUR OPPOSITION COMMENT COMES FROM LINE FOR SIXTEEN. JERRY MEMBERS JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON THE UP CALIFORNIA GOLD COAST- CALIFORNIA WILL BE CONVENIENT CLIENT ALL THESE BUT I GET A LETTER AND ON BY BUT WE ARE BOTH NEXT BECAUSE- NO FOR THE LINES IN HERE. OKAY THANK YOU- YOU KNOW JUST THAT WOULD WHEN I FIRST BECAME CHAIR OF ENERGY HERE IN THE SENATE THERE WAS THE EXPLOSION IN TORRANCE WE DID ACTUALLY GO THERE AND DO AN INVESTIGATION THERE WE ALSO CONDUCTED- AND INVEST IN A GAS PRICES STATEWIDE TOUR MET WITH OF PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY AND I AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW- IT. YOU KNOW PERSONALLY IT WAS IT WAS A DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE- IT'S VERY HARD TO GET INFORMATION IS CHAIR OF ENERGY HERE IN THE SENATE. VERY HARD TO GET DEFINITIVE ANSWERS ABOUT WHERE THE PRICES- OF THE COSTS WILL ACTUALLY COME FROM. THAT WAS IN AND ENCOURAGE JEAN- EXPERIENCE I DID I CAME TO MY OWN CONCLUSIONS BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT THOSE CONCLUSIONS. WERE ACCURATE BECAUSE WE THAT NO REAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED- TO EVEN LEGISLATORS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. WE KNOW THAT WHEN THERE'S A DROUGHT AFFECTS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WE KNOW. THAT THERE'S A SUPPLY AND DEMAND WE KNOW WHEN WE I THINK WE'RE WE'RE TELEVISIONS UNDERSTAND SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF THAT AFFECTS OF. PRICES BUT- BUT THE I HAVE FOUND THAT ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX MARKETS IN THE UNIVERSE IS PROBABLY EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH PETROLEUM BECAUSE IS SO SECRET. AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT- YOU KNOW SOME OF OFTEN THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH RISING GAS PRICES. R. O. RESULT ACTUALLY ROCK OR A RESULT OF THOSE CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT'S NOT A FUNCTION OF WEATHER PATTERNS IT'S NOT A FUNCTION NOT EVEN OF WARS I MEAN WE KNOW THAT EVEN DURING WARS. OF THE IN SOME CASES I MEAN I UNDERSTAND IF THEY START PLAYING FIELD TONIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT IF- EXTRACTION IN CERTAIN AREAS COMPLETELY COME TO A HALT. AND IF THAT'S MEASURABLE THAT WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE AN IMPACT. ON ON ON DEMAND ON A SUPPLY. BUT WHEN NOTHING IT IS SIX AFFECTING THE SUPPLY CHAINS IT SEEMS TO JUST TO HAVE A THIS VERY CAPRICIOUS EFFECT ON PRICES AND I THINK PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS ESPECIALLY WHEN MANY. ARE COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THIS RESOURCE FOR THEIR DAILY LIVES THIS IS- AT ONE POINT IN HUMAN HISTORY SALT WAS CONSIDERED ON AN ISSUE OF NATIONAL SECURITY I'VE- BEEN TROLLED HIM. HIS IS ONE OF THOSE COMMODITIES THAT IS THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF NATIONAL SECURITY WE FIGHT FIGHT WARS OVER IT THERE ARE. CONFLICTS RELATED TO ACCESS UNIT. ABOUT FOR THE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE MANY ARE DEPENDENT UPON THIS FUEL SOURCE TO CONDUCT THEIR DAILY LIVES AND THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY NO ALTERNATIVES FOR MANY PEOPLE. AND SIMPLY ASKING A DISCLOSURE I DON'T THINK WOULD AFFECT- COULD COME COMPETITION BETWEEN. OIL COMPANIES AND IF IT DOES LET'S LET'S INVITE A HEALTHY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. IF IT I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T BUY THAT ARGUMENT I THINK IT'S A SIMPLY A FUNCTION OF- AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS A PROTECTED STATUS IN TERMS OF. DISCLOSURES OF A OF A OF A COMMODITY IS A SO IMPORTANT. TO THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR OF OUR STATE THE NUMBER COUNTRIES SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS AT ALL- AN EXTREME BILL I THINK IT'S- A VERY REASONABLE BILL WE WE'VE HAD TESTIMONY SAID IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE IF IT'S- IF IT'S BEEN DONE LET ME SHARE IT WITH THE PUBLIC LIFT PEOPLE. OF THE COMMUNITY MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS AND LET THEM UNDERSTAND WHERE WHERE OF THIS. THIS THESE CHARGES ARE COMING FROM IT'S JUST BEEN- THE SADDEST THING FOR ME TO EXPERIENCE THIS DEBATE ABOUT OIL PRICES BEING ALL ABOUT TAXES YET TAXES. CONTRIBUTE TO THE COSTS. DEFINITELY BUT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO TAXES IT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO EVERYTHING ELSE. WENT WHEN THE COST IS. FIVE TO SIX DOLLARS A GALLON AND TAXES NEVER INCREASED HAPPENED IN OUR STATE AND WHO IS BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND CAN CONSUMERS- WHO WHO CAN CAN CONSUMERS GO TO ASK FOR SOME KIND OF HELP- RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN AMERICA AND THERE'S NO WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE DEPENDENT ON THIS. A RESOURCE AND- I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THIS IS A COORDINATED EFFORT I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IT IS BY THE OIL COMPANIES BUT AT THE SAME TIME. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THAT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR. THAT IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A SITUATION THAT'S HAPPENING WORLDWIDE. AND WHILE PEOPLE ARE COMING TOGETHER AND- RALLY IN. AS AS AS A COUNTRY BEHIND. AN EFFORT. BEHIND THE INITIATIVE SO IMPORTANT TO US TERMS OF FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY OR FIGHTING FOR. A NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY ACROSS THE WORLD I MEAN PEOPLE ARE STEPPING UP AND I JUST SEE THAT. WELL COMPANIES ARE NOT THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION IT SEEMS THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE. IT MAY NOT BE IN IF IT'S NOT WE'D LOVE TO HEAR WITH THAT EXPLANATION IS THAT WE ALWAYS GET. THE SAME EXPLANATION THAT THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE ON THE SUBJECT I'LL I'LL I'M SURE EVERYONE WANTS TO MAKE A COMMENT I'LL START WITH SENATOR MEN. AND IF THERE'S ANYONE OUT OF HAND SO I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK- OKAY I WAS RIGHT. SO WE'LL GO TO CENTER BECKER CENTER DOLLY CENTER BURGESS AND I FOR STUFF. YES OKAY- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BEFORE I APPRECIATE THE GOALS OF THIS BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS- MENTIONED. TRY TO GET THE- SENATE. YES IMPORTANT GOAL BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILLS THAT EXPRESS THE AUTHOR. I STARTED MY CAREER AS AN ATTORNEY FOR SPENT ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION- AND I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE DANGERS OF COMMODITIES MARKET MANIPULATION. I HAVE CONCERNS IT'S THIS AT A PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO THE SPOT MARKETS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- BOUGHT HOUSING LOC SUGGESTS AS AS THE LAWSUIT OF A TALL AT ALL SUGGESTS. I THIS IS A VERY PARTICULAR AS MARKET IT'S A SOMEWHAT THIN MARKET IT'S ARE CLEARLY VULNERABLE TO PRICE MANIPULATION. IN SOME OF THE DATA THAT THAT MIGHT BE DISCLOSED THEIR AT THE CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT. IT COULD ALLOW FOR- YOU KNOW. PERHAPS LESSEN SCRUPULOUS. OUTSIDE TRADERS TO TRY TO MANIPULATE THESE MARKETS- AND SO I THAT CONCERNS RAISED ME I WOULD I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IT SENATOR AND THAT YOU'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO TRYING TO. ADDRESS THIS AND I KNOW SOME OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS HELP IN THAT REGARD I'M A KEEP AN EYE ON THIS- AND I WANT TO LISTEN THE REST OF THE BAIT- I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO THE RIGHT THING BUT I JUST WANT EXPRESSED THAT CONCERN THAT I HAVE. BECAUSE YEAH WE HAVE TO BE CARE. THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A BILL LIKE THIS AND- IF IT ENDS UP LEADING TO MORE MARKET MANIPULATION. THAT THAT CLEARLY IS NOT WHAT WE WANT. NO QUESTION. DID JUST RESPOND AMERICA WHAT YOU. BEFORE YOU GOT HERE. WE DID TALK ABOUT HOW- HOW THIS THE DAY THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN THIS BILL IS DATED OF THE FIFTY WELL COMPANIES. SHARED IN THE PAST WITH THE STATE CALIFORNIA AND STOPPED HE STATED THAT THEY DISCLOSE TO THEIR- SHAREHOLDERS LIKE THE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES AND IT'S ALSO. DATA THAT IN VARIOUS FORMATS WELL COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY SHARING AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSING A NUMBER OTHER AMERICAN STATES. AND AS YOU MENTIONED I DO THINK THE- DEMANDS- HERE TO HELP WITH WITH. WITH WITH WITH IN CONFORMITY WITH AND MARKET BUT TO CONCERNS NOT BUT I PREFER COMMENTS AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO THIS IS TRICKY RIGHT THIS IS VERY TRUE. FEELINGS ZERO DOCTORS THOUGHT WITH THE GOING TO THE THIS. WE'RE JUST TRYING TRYING LIGHT ON IT AND- TRYING TO. GET THIS IN A PLACE WHERE. WHERE TAX GONNA GET TO THE- THE GOALS AND NOT CONTRIBUTE TO MARKET MANIPULATION. OKAY SIR DALY. WELL FIRST I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT- GOSH WERE START THIS THIS IS A BIT COMPLICATED PERSONAL NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO I THINK THAT. I MEAN ANYBODY THAT IS RUN A BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THAT. THERE'S NOT  LOT OF LEGISLATORS THAT DO A PAYROLL EVERY TWO WEEKS AND ACTUALLY. MANAGE A BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA SO I WANT TO SHARE SOME FACTS WITH YOU IN THIS THIS IS. JUST ACROSS THE BOARD. CALIFORNIA HAS THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX THOUSAND REGULATIONS. BUT NOT FOR OIL WAIT UP FELLOW YEAH THERE'S A LOT FOR AND THE CLOSEST STATE TO US IS NEW YORK WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND LESS SO. THAT'S THE THAT'S THE START OF THE END BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND THOSE OF THOSE REGULATIONS RULES COMES OUT OF. THIS LEGISLATURE OVER. EVERY YEAR THERE'S A THOUSAND A THOUSAND NEW LAWS PASSED THE SEMI GONNA DEAL WITH. SO WE TALK ABOUT OIL IN CALIFORNIA AND GASOLINE AND WE HAVE- SPECIAL BLENDS. WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE TAKING ALL THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. BUT ALSO SET ON SUB TO. WHERE WE HAVE WE TALK ABOUT A THOUSAND WELLS SITTING AT CAL CHEN READY TO BE PERMITTED THAT THE OIL COMPANIES ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE REGULATORS TO OUT REGULATE. AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING RATE THEY'RE NOT GETTING OPENED UP. SO WE START TALKING ABOUT OIL AND FOR SOME REASON. OIL IS LIKE. THE ANTI CHRIST AROUND HERE. CABALLERO CAME IN FRONT OF OUR COMMITTEE WE CAN GO TRYING TO DO CARBON CAPTURE AND THEY WANT TO SAY NOPE YOU WE CAN DO EVERYTHING BUT OIL. WHAT SO I KNOW AND WE'VE SEEN IT IT THE PRESIDENT UNITED STATES IS TALKING ABOUT COMPANIES ARE GOUGING BECAUSE INFLATION IS GOING UP THAT'S B. S. THE REASON WE HAVE INFLATION IS COULD WE STOP TROOP FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS INTO OUR ECONOMY. AND YOU YOU IF YOU'RE GONNA PLACE AND WHEN YOU DO THAT. NATIONWIDE I'M IN BUSINESS I AM GETTING THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF. THE INFLATION IS DRIVING UP AND I HAVE TO PASS THAT COST ON AND THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING UP EVERYTHING IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY ANYTIME SOON NO MATTER. WHO'S MAKING PROFITS ARE NOT. SO I THINK THAT WE NEED IS YOU KNOW FOCUS MORE ON HOW DO WE ACTUALLY DRIVE THE COST DOWN. WE DON'T PRODUCE MORE THE WAY YOU. THE WAY IT HERE AT HOME. THE WAY YOU DRIVE THE COST DOWN TO SUPPLY AND DEMAND WHICH THAT WHICH CHAIR TALKED ABOUT. I'M IN THE C. BUSINESS. THE ONLY TIME I REALLY MAKE MONEY IS WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE LOSES MONEY. BECAUSE WE SEE WHAT I WHAT I MEAN BY THAT THE WEATHER SOMEWHERE CHANGED. BECAUSE WE PRODUCE PLENTY OF FOOD. BUT THE TIME I ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY IS WHEN THERE'S A DROUGHT SOMEWHERE ELSE WHETHER SOME FLUCTUATIONS NOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU HAVE TO DOLLAR GALLON FUEL HIGHER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE YOUR LETTER GRADES ARE HIGHER. YOUR YOUR- WAGES ARE HIGHER ALL THE SINGER OF CALIFORNIA YOU'RE COMPETING AGAINST OTHER STATES. IN THIS CASE FOR OIL IT'S THE RATE WE HAVE SPECIAL BLENDS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO DO WE DID YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GO AFTER THE OIL COMPANIES YOU WANT TO BLAME. THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED MORE OIL. AND WE CUT TALK ABOUT WINNING HIM OFF THEY GOING TO ELECTRIC CARS. IN OUR GREAT ISN'T SET UP TO DO THAT SO IT'S SUPPOSED TO COME OUT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO SEE HOW WE CAN REALLY GET THERE AND WHAT WHAT'S THE- WHAT'S THE- YOU TO LOOK LIKE. WE'RE DO THAT WE SET GOALS AROUND HERE WE- FORCE THEM TO DO. ALL KINDS OF REGULATIONS. AND THEN. WHEN THE PRICE GOES UP AND THEY MAKE SOME MONEY TO STAY IN BUSINESS. YOUR WERE FRUSTRATED WITH THAT. YOU CAN'T. RUN A BUSINESS WITHOUT MAKING A PROFIT. IN ANY CASE- IF YOU'RE A CALIFORNIA RUN A BUSINESS YOUR PROFIT MARGINS ARE GETTING THINNER AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE MINE ARE IN MY BUSINESS AND IS DUE BECAUSE- THOSE POLICIES IS THERE SO YOU WANT TO GO HAMMER ON THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO UP BUT ABOUT A BUSINESS SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SO I'M JUST FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE ALWAYS GOING TO BLAME SOMEBODY IT'S UKRAINE IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY TO BLAME BUT OUR OWN POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF THAT DRIVE THE COST OF LIVING UP IN CALIFORNIA'S ACROSS THE BOARD. CENTER BAKER. I DON'T BLAME YOU JUST. MENTIONED YES THANKS I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT I WAS SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS OF INDUSTRY ABOUT DATA- REVEALING CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND POTENTIALLY ENABLING MARKET MANIPULATION AS WE DISCUSSED- IT DOES LOOK AT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- HAVE CHANGED THAT TO KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL SO- THAT WITH THOSE CHANGES THAT YOU PLAN TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SIR BORDERS. WHY I'M REALLY HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS IS BY HIS BILL WHILE DAY THIS BUILDING WITH MANY THINGS THAT WERE SAID ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE- FROM- CENTER DALLY THAT YOUNG. YOU CAN YOU CAN EXPECT WHAT WE DO IN THIS BUILDING TO NOT IMPACT WHAT OCCURS IN THE MARKETPLACE AND THE OVERALL CALCULUS OF DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA NO WAS UNDER ANY ILLUSION THAT CALIFORNIA IS A PRO BUSINESS STATE- THERE ARE DESIGNATED- WINNERS. AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY. DESIGNATED LOSERS- BUT AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE A SOFT SPOT WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE LOOKING INTO MATTERS ON THE MERITS. AND IF THERE IS A IF THERE IS A TRUE INQUIRY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CHOKEPOINTS ARE THAT ARE EXAGGERATING THE COSTS OF FUEL. I THINK THAT COULD BE HELPFUL TO FIND THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T NECESSARILY TRUST. THE CONFIGURATION OF WHO WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AND HOW IT WOULD BE ASSEMBLED SO YOU KNOW I HAD CONVERSATIONS AND- YOU ARE A MAN OF YOUR WORD AS A LEGISLATOR IN A PERSON- BUT I WOULD I WANTED TO THROW THIS OUT THERE MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I HAD I BROUGHT UP TO YOU IS. CONFIDENTIALITY WE'RE TALKING A PUBLICLY TRADED ENTITIES WE'RE THE REFINEMENT COSTS. ARE ESSENTIALLY PROPRIETARY PIECES OF INFORMATION. THAT CAN BE EXPLOITED BY MANIPULATOR AS WE HEARD FROM SENATOR MAN EARLIER. THAT YOU CAN'T JUST **** NILLY THROW OUT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND NOT EXPECT THERE BE TO BE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. AND SO WE'RE IS THERE A REASONABLE PATH FORWARD- WE HAVE A HISTORY AS LEGISLATORS. OF FINDING COMMITTEES. OR TASKING INDIVIDUALS IN A THINK TANK FORMAT WHETHER BE- THROUGH THE AUDITOR OR WHETHER IT BE THROUGH SOME OTHER EXISTING DIVISION OF THE STATE TO LOOK INTO THESE CHECKPOINTS IT'S SUCH AS REFINEMENT. ASSOCIATES ALSO AND- PUMP- SELLERS IT'S THE A TO Z. OF WHERE ARE THE INFLATIONARY CHIP- CHOKEPOINTS. BECAUSE YES RUSSIA HAS EXAGGERATED THE COSTS YES UKRAINE HAS EXAGGERATED THE COSTS. BUT SO HAS REGULATION IN CALIFORNIA IN THE OBSCENE OVERHEAD- TAXES THAT WE THAT WE PLACE ON THIS INDUSTRY. SO IT'S MORE OF AN INCREASE TO YOU. HOW WOULD YOU REALISTICALLY SPLIT THIS BABY IN SUCH A WAY THAT. THE INDUSTRY FEELS THAT INFORMATION IS PROTECTED AND THAT THE MERITS OF THIS ISSUE ARE BEING LOOKED AT. ODD IN EARNEST. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND OUT WHERE THESE WERE THESE VITAL PIECE OF INFORMATION ARE. SO MANY THROWED OUT TO YOU IS THERE IS THERE A PATH FORWARD I JUST DON'T KNOW YEAH SO THE COMMITTEE AMENDS- DELETE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE REFINERY SPECIFIC INFORMATION SO WORKS A WEEK SO WE WOULD- WE WOULD TAKE THE VISIT THE VIEW OF THIS ISSUE UP TO TEN THOUSAND FEET SO THAT THAT SHOULD TAKE AWAY A GOOD DEAL THE MARKETPLACE CONCERNS THAT ARE THERE- THAT'S ONE THING I WOULD SAY. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION IS ALREADY DISCLOSE IN VARIOUS FORMS- IN OTHER PLACES IT WAS ALREADY IT WAS DISCLOSED IN THE PAST IN CALIFORNIA- THE MORE YOU HAVE SOME OF THE FOLKS WERE INVOLVED THIS BILL FEELS THAT THEY STOPPED DISCLOSING IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- THEY WERE MAKING EXTRA MONEY HERE. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY I'M I'M NOT MAKING THAT ASSERTION I'M NOT BLAMING THEM RIGHT I MEAN WHAT THIS BILL IS OPENING UP ABOUT. HOW TO GET MORE DISCLOSURE SO WE CAN HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON THERE'S ONE ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT THIS IS. LARGELY ALL HAPPENING AT THE RETAILER'S SITE IS AT THE GAS STATIONS AND IF THAT'S REALLY TRUE LET'S SHOW THAT TOO BUT BUT ULTIMATELY THIS IS AN ISSUE YOU WITHIN YOU BRING UP TAXES DROPS RIGHT IT'S A LOT OF MONEY. BUT THAT'S QUANTIFIABLE. OUT THERE FOR ANYONE TO SEE THAT THERE'S OTHER MYSTERY SURCHARGE THAT IS THAT THAT THAT WE KNOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S. PAYING OUR PAIN RIGHT THATTHE GHOST WHAT IS BEING CHARGED IN OTHER STATES THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT IS THERE EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR SPECIAL BLEND EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR GAS TAX THAT'S ALL LAID OUT BY BY PROFESSORS BY BY DATA SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN STUDIED. A PRETTY CONSIDERABLY. SO ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS JUST GET SMART ITS DISCLOSURE ON THIS ISSUE- I MEAN I HEAR YOU MAY MAYBE YOU WANT TO RE FRAME IT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THERE THERE ARE. ARE YOU FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- THE- DIRT THERE MORE TOOLS WE CAN GIVE THE CDC AND THE IN THE DOJ. I TOOK TO GET MORE ACCESS TO INFORMATION THE SPACE AND YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON WHERE. THIS BILL GOES I'M I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THOSE AVENUES- ALL RIGHT PART OF WHAT THE BEAUTY THAT TOO MANY PROCESSES YOU GET THESE ISSUES OUT WE FLUSH THAT WE ALL TALK ABOUT IT AND- AND WE KIND OF SEE WHERE THESE. WERE THESE BILLS GO- MOVING FORWARD- THAT SO I'M OPEN TO LOTS OF DIFFERENT AVENUES HERE BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY. I YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS A DISCLOSURE BILL IT'S ALL ABOUT TRYING TO. IN A IN A IN A FAIR WAY- MORE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC AND TO REGULATORS SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON- AND IN THE END OF THE DATE WITH SO MUCH RESPECT TO SENATOR YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUFFERING THE MOST WITH HIGHER ENERGY COSTS AND THERE AND THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS AT PLAY THERE'S NO QUESTION. SOME OF SO MUCH OF IT IS REGULATORY I'M I'M NOT DENYING THAT BUT THERE'S BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE TO. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE TOO. AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S DEMONSTRABLE. ALL RIGHT SO- WHY WOULDN'T THIS BE FASHIONED AS A COMMISSIONED THING TANK INVESTIGATION. BECAUSE THE IDEA OF PUBLICLY DISCLOSING IT PRESUPPOSES THAT THERE'S NO VARIOUS ACTIONS A PLAY. AND THIS ONEROUS MONTHLY THING- THE IDEA WOULD BE TO KIND OF WE GOT WE GOT A MOMENT IN TIME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE IT AS A SAMPLE. COULDN'T POINTSTREAK BE REVEALED WITHIN A SIX MONTHS OR ONE YEAR- PERIOD OF TIME- DATA ASSEMBLY. SO YOU'RE SAYING TO CREATE SOME SORT OF. PASK FORCE OR BEEF UP THE EXISTS FOR STRUCTURE AND SEE YOU SEE THAT IS SOME SOMETHING THAT ACHIEVES WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE IF WHAT YOU WANT IS TO FIND OUT WHERE THOSE POINTS ARE. THAT I THINK COULD BE SMARTER AND MORE EFFICIENT FOR US- TO A CHOIR THE INFORMATION IN THE IN CAMERA CONFIDENTIAL WAY. BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO OPPOSE THIS OUT OF THE GATE THE FACT THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INITIALLY THE ORIGINAL DRAFT WAS PUBLIC DISCLOSURE LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO JUST CREATE- A GENIE OUT OF A BOTTLE- TYPE SITUATION. BUT LISTEN I'M ONLY I'M ONLY ONE PERSON I'M SORRY I'VE TAKEN UP SOME REAL I AM NOT ONLY ONE AT THIS POINT EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS OR MAYBE ASK OUR YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THE BILL HERE. WELL AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK. YOU COULD COULD BE DONE IS THAT IF THIS WERE IN A THINK TANK FORMAT. IN CAMERA. MEANING THAT THERE'S NO DISCLOSURE OF ANY INFORMATION AND IT'S WITHIN A REFINED PERIOD OF TIME- I THINK THAT WOULD BE IT IN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO IT TO MOVE FORWARD IN AND I'VE YOU. IF IT WERE TO GO IN THAT EVOLUTION IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE- I THINK YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT- I COULD PROBABLY GET ON BOARD WITH. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMERCE FOR THERE'S NOBODY ELSE JUST. LOOK AND AT. SERTOLI WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON BECAUSE WE GOT WE GOT MORE BILL STAY HERE. AND WE STILL HAVE LIMITED TIME OF. OKAY WOULD YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT THE ALL THE REGULATORY FEES THAT ARE NOT THAT ARE JUST BUSINESS HAS TO HAVE THE COST OF WHAT THE COST OF PAYROLL TAXES ALL THE THINGS IN CALIFORNIA DO WE PAY HIGHER THAN ANYWHERE YOU THAT'S ADDS INTO THAT EQUATION THAT THAT THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN IN THE FIRST IT SHOULD BE CAN USERS ABSOLUTELY AND- YOU SEE OKAY THAT'S FINE YES. GO AHEAD BUT- LET'S LET'S MOVE FORWARD. AND I'LL LET YOU MAKE YOUR- COMMENTS BUT THE WHAT WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THE DISCUSSION IS THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW THESE ARE MY- SHOPS. AND THAT THAT OUR OUR REGULATIONS ARE CAUSE FOR THE- THE PRICING. AND THE TRUTH IS I MEAN THESE ARE COMPANIES A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT BASED IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN'T ATTRIBUTE THAT COST. TO COMPANIES I MEAN THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT MAKE UP A FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR. INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE THAT REPRESENTS THREE POINT 8% OF THE ENTIRE WORLD ECONOMY. SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MOM AND POPS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY ANY STATE REGULATION IN PARTICULAR YES OF COURSE. THERE AFFECTED I THINK SOME MOST REGULATIONS CALIFORNIA PERTAIN TO SAFETY AN EXTRACTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT. IN TERMS OF MY EXPERIENCE HERE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LARGEST. OIL COMPANY EREMENKO THEY'RE NOT EVEN FROM CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE MASSIVE IF YOU CONSIDER EXXON IS NUMBER TWO ON THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED LIST. AND THEIR THIRD IN THE WORLD LIST I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EREKLE BRIDGE PETROLEUM EXXON CHEVRON THE CERTAIN SET OF. COMPANIES THAT HAVE A HUGE MARKET SHARE THAN SHOULD HAVE SOME LEVEL. OF COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THE MANAGER RESOURCE THAT REALLY CONTROLS THE ENTIRE WORLD ECONOMY WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A LOT WITH THIS BILL. AND WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR INFORMATION THAT'S EVEN PROPRIETARY BUT- I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO GET MORE INFORMED IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE AND HOW THIS RESOURCES MANAGE POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IN OUR COUNTRY SO I'LL LET YOU MAKE. I OF THE CREATURE DOT MY COMMENTS AS YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS AND WANNA MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL ONES FEEL FREE THANK YOU I DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I I'M AND I SAW YOU RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS WE SET UP A FRAZIER I THINK HE'S AFRAID OF THE FACT THAT IN VARIOUS FORMATS THESE ARE THE STATE IS ALREADY BEEN DISCLOSED IN OTHER IN OTHER STATES- I LOVE THE KIA COMES ISSUE CENTER I. APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS I THINK. YOU'RE GETTING YOUR GETTING THE CORP OR TRY TO GET OUT WITH THIS BILL- THE END OF THE DAY. NOPE NO MATTER WHAT. VERSION IT ENDS UP ON THE FLOOR AND THE OTHER HOUSE. WE WOULD WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT. SHINING LIGHT ON ON ON ON THIS THIS. THIS THIS. MAKE THIS DELTA THIS GAP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN OUR PRICE AND OTHER STATES EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ALL THE REGULATION THE GAS AND EVERYTHING- THE TAX EVERYTHING ELSE. AT GIVE ME OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS AND- I RESPECT YESTERDAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE'LL KEEP. PLUGGING ALONG. WE'LL GO TO SENATOR BECKER AND S. B.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM WE'RE WAITING FOR QUORUM- TRYING TO GET IT NOW. SENATOR STERN YOU'RE NEXT I ACTUALLY CENTER BECKER ITEM NUMBER NINE ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT RELATED TO. ELECTRICITY SUPPLIERS THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS AT HEART THIS IS A SIMPLE IDEA WE SEKARANG HOUSE GAS TARGETS FOR OVER ELECTRICITY SUPPLIERS. BUT WE HAVE NOTHING IN PLACE TO MEASURE HOW WELL THEY'RE DOING AGAINST THOSE TARGETS. THIS BILL FIXES THAT GAP IT DIRECTED CC TO ESTABLISH RULES FOR ELECTRICITY SUPPLIERS TO ANALYZE OUR SOURCES WHAT TRICITY AND REPORT. ON THE ASSOCIATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT CAN MEASURE PROGRESS HELLO EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE TO DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. HOW WE TRACK ELECTRICITY SOURCES AND MEASURE MISSIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT HISTORICALLY THE MOST LOOKED AT HOW MUCH CLEANER YOU USUALLY PURCHASED OVER ENTIRE YEAR. COMPARED TO THE LOAD DURING THAT YEAR. BUT AS WE GET HIGHER AND HIGHER PERCENT OF CLEAN ENERGY THIS LONGER MAKES SENSE THE GREAT HAS TO BALANCE SUPPLY AND LOAD MINUTES A MINUTE. NOT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. A COUPLE EXAMPLES ARE MOVING QUICKLY INTEREST OF TIME BUT GOOGLE WAS A PIONEER IN THINKING ABOUT THIS DIFFERENTLY. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY RIDE TO THE GOAL POWER 1100% RENEWABLE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. BUT THEY REALIZE THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. SO THEY SET A HIGHER TARGET FOR THEMSELVES TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH ENERGY WAS COMING FROM CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES. WITH ALLIES ON A TIME MATCH SPACES OUR OUR- THEN IMPROVE ON THAT YOURS. IT'S A CLEAN ENERGY BUT ONE OF OUR SPEAKERS WILL COVER THIS. BUT THEY'VE BEEN A PIONEER IN THIS AREA AS WELL. THEY FOUND THAT THE G. G. INTENSITY OF THEIR PARRIS FIFTEEN TIMES HIGHER WHEN MEASURED MORE ACCURATELY OUR OUR THEN MEASURED USING ANNUAL ASSUMPTIONS. AND THE P. C. ALSO WISELY CHOSE TO USE ARE REALLY ANALYSIS FOR LECTURES THE SUPPLIERS AND THEIR- ASSOCIATES GHG EMISSIONS AND IN THE R. P. PROCESS. THE R. P. PLANS ARE HOWEVER JUST FORECAST WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING STABBING A FAIR AND ACCURATE WAY TO MEASURE HARD ONE IS DOING SO WILL TRANSPARENTLY WILL HAVE TRANSPARENCY IN AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S NOT ABOUT CREATING NEW TARGETS. I WANNA CLARIFY ONE PIECE WHICH IS THIS BILL IS NOT CHANGING THE POWER SOURCE CLOSER PROGRAM OR THE POWER CONTENT LABEL THE ORIGINAL COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. INCORRECTLY REFERRED TO PRIVATE VERSION THAT WOULD HAVE ALTERED THOSE A PROGRAMS. THEIR NUMBER OTHER DETAILS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW EXACTLY THESE REPORTING RULES SHOULD WORK. AND HOW MUCH DETAIL SHOULD BE LEFT THE CECE'S WERE MAKING PROCESS DEFINE. I APPRECIATE COMMITTEE SPORTS DAYS WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE. A LOT. I WAS THREE I BOOKED BUT WE HAVE GOT A FREEMAN FROM TURN HERE AND THEN ON THE PHONE CHEN PEPPER CO PENCIL CLEAN ENERGY. SO I HAVE ARMOND COHEN IS A JOINT CHEN PEPPER. YEAH CAN BE. I WELL ABOVE CONVENTIONAL SIR WITH MATT FRIEDMAN HERE IN THE ROOM OKAY JEFF- MATT YOU HAVE NINETY SECONDS SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE OUR MONEY IS NOT FRIEDMAN HERE REPRESENTING TURN THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK HERE TO OFFER STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO COLLECT AND PUBLISH DATA ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT EACH RETAIL A LOOKS AT SELLER OF ELECTRICITY. IN A MANNER THAT TRACKS ACTUAL HOURLY PURCHASES OF BOTH CLEAN AND DIRTY ENERGY TO SERVE CUSTOMER NEEDS. I'M THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ALREADY REQUIRES LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO FORECAST HOURLY PROCUREMENT AN HOURLY DEMAND AS PART OF ITS INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAM. AND THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE PROPOSED SUPPLY PORTFOLIOS BUT THE PC DOESN'T ATTEMPT WAS HAS WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED OVER TIME. THIS BILL WOULD REMEDY THE GAP. BY REQUIRING ONGOING COLLECTION OF HOURLY DATA. TO CREATE MEANINGFUL BENCHMARKS FOR EVALUATING BOTH FUTURE COMMITMENTS AND PAST PROMISES. SB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WILL ALSO DIRECT THE ENERGY COMMISSION MAKE A LONG OVERDUE UPDATE TO THE EMISSIONS FACTORS APPLY TO SO CALLED UNSPECIFIED POWER THAT CAN'T BE TRACKED ANY INDIVIDUAL GENERATING UNITS. THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF THIS GOAL GEN ERIC GHG EMISSIONS FACTOR IN EVERY OUT PARTY SUNDAY IT HASN'T BEEN UPDATED TWO. OF TWO OF REFLECT UP IN GREAT. OVER THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS.
