AND I HAVE NO ONE SHOWING OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE RIGHT SO WE'LL GO TO THE DíAS- SENATOR JACKSON ADEQUATE GO AHEAD SENATOR JEFF ACTUALLY NOT NOT A QUESTION A- AN APPRECIATION FOR BRINGING. AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO HAVE ONE OF OUR REPUBLICAN SISTERS. WHO IS THIS I HAPPEN TO HAVE HAD AN OFF NEEDED TO TALK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON. WHO'S A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON AND WHO MADE IT A POINT TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. IN RETURN THE CARD ASIAN. THIS AND THEREFORE THE IS TO COME TO THIS CONCEPT OF FREE OF. AND IS QUITE AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT FOLKS FIT THEY DO GET OUT OF. AND I THINK THIS IS A- THE TO MOVE FROM XIN THAT THE BAY WAY TO KILL PEOPLE IS TO INCARCERATE THEM. FOR PUNISHMENT MOST PEOPLE IN ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND IF WE ARE WILLING TO REST THEIR PROBLEMS WHEN THEY COME BACK OUT THEY WILL RESPOND OF IT. IS THE PROBLEM CORRECT. AN THE I AM REMINDED OF AN EXPERIENCE COUPLE YEARS AGO. THE SENATE TOOK A TRIP TO PORTUGAL AND SPAIN. AND PORTUGAL SORT OF LIKE KENTUCKY RECOGNIZED THAT TO SIMPLY INCARCERATE PEOPLE WAS NOT SOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS. AND SO THEY LOOKED AT A LOT OF THEIR ADDICTION ISSUES AS A HEALTH ISSUE NOT A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE. AND THEY REDUCED THEIR RATE OF. IT WILL NOT CHEST OF CONVICTION BUT AND INCARCERATION BUT OF ACTUAL- ADDICTION. BECAUSE THE TREATED THE PROBLEM. AND IT IT WAS REALLY QUITE AN EYE OPENING EXPERIENCE THE FACT THAT OUR FRIENDS IN KENTUCKY ARE WAY AHEAD OF US ON THIS KENTUCKY ISN'T KNOWN AS FAR AS I KNOW IS A- SORT OF A TOUCHY FEELY GRANOLA TYPE PLAY IT'S PRETTY HARD CO. IN MANY BUT- WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS AND THE REASON I'M SPEAKING MADAM CHAIR IN. YOU NEED. TO REPORT OUR TION OF WHAT TO ACRONYM JUSTICE IS AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOSE BEHAVIOR JUSTIFIED INCARCERATIONS BUT WHILE THEY WERE DATING THE WORK ON TRYING TO HELP THEM CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR. ADDICTION IS A- BY ALLOWING US TO GIVE INCENTIVES TO PEOPLE. TO TRY TO THAT BEHAVIOR TO OVERCOME. THEIR ADDICTION TO HELP THEM DO THAT SO THE WHEN THEY GET OUT THE KNOCK IN RECIDIVIST TODAY ARE ACTUALLY GET THE TOOLS THE ABILITY TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND IS I THINK AN OVERDUE CONCEPT THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA'S. HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE GAME ON END SO. I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN IS A CO AUTHOR I DON'T TO THEIR FREE MUCH. BUT BASED UPON WHAT I. HAVE ONE AT A FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT PEOPLE. ARE USUALLY IN CARS. FOR PRETTY DELIVERY SINCE AND WE DON'T ADDRESS THOSE WHY THEY'RE IN CARS. WE WILL CAN TO HAVE THE HIGHEST RECIDIVISM. I AM THE CAR. AMONG THE- I AM. THAT FOR BROUGHT BILL. HELLO A SISTER IN ACROSS THE AISLE RECCA THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS I'M HOPING THIS WILL BE A BI PARTISAN ISSUE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE IT IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE SO WITH THAT I WOULD ALSO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU MA'AM. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMON QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT SO- WE HAVE A MOTION WHICH IS TO PASS TWO PROBES AND WE CAN PUT IN THE REQUEST TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE CAN'T- INCLUDE IN THE IN. THE CO AUTHORS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SIMPLY MEMBER HERE TO CONSENT BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY IN IT IN REQUESTED SENATOR JACKSON LIKE TO BE ADDED TO SCHOOL OUT THERE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. AND THINK THE IMPORTANT. BOTH THE PRESENTER AND TO THE WITNESS DID IS THAT MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR ADDICTIONS THERE'S MORE AND MORE. RESEARCH AND DATA SUPPORTING MEDICALLY SISTER TREATMENT AND WITH THE NUMBERS OF THE DICK OPIATE ADDICTED PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY NOW. TO FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THE SCIENCE BASED EVIDENCE OF THE EFFICACY OF MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT I THINK IT'S VERY WEISS AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE VISUALS WHO HAVE THESE TYPE OF ADDICTIONS AS SOMEHOW WEEK SO I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT IT ALSO A VALUE. EIGHT HIGH TREE THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND OF COURSE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL WE HAVE THE MOTION ON IT BRADFORD ON MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR I'LL BE VERY BRIEF ON I THINK THIS TO COMMONSENSE MEASURE. BUT A MEASURE IT SHOULDN'T BE ANY OF THE BLACK COMBAT. WELCOME HAS BEEN MAKE PAYMENT FOR OVER FORTY. OF TREATMENT AND I HATE TO ALWAYS USE RACE BUT I'M GONNA MAKE THE PRALLEL NON TO WHITE FOLKS START DYING FROM OPIOID ADDICTION THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY- SEE A NEED TO PROVIDE TREATMENT STARTED IMPRISONMENT SO THIS IS COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND I'M HONORED. TO PRESENT ON BEHALF OF MISS WALDRON AND I RESPECT FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. FOR IT THREE OUT THE MOTION THANK YOU HAVE A MOTION THE PAST TWO. UP TO CALL THE ROLL.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS COREY SOCIAL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVEN THREE TWO. EXISTING STATE REGULATION REQUIRES THE HEALTH AUTHORITY OF A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY STATE OR LOCAL TO SET FORTH IN WRITING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN CONFORMANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. WHICH ARE REVIEWED AND UPDATED AT LEAST EVERY TWO YEARS ON A NUMBER OF TOPICS INCLUDING PROVISION FOR BEING IN CARE OF PREGNANT AND- INMATES INCLUDING PRENATAL AND POST PARTUM INFORMATION AND HEALTH. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ACCESS TO NECESSARY VITAMINS AS RECOMMENDED BY A PHYSICIAN FROM A TRAINING PROCEDURE CATION AN INFILL CARE WE GOING TO THAT IT'S- INAPPROPRIATE TO SET- USE TREATMENT SCHEDULE SPECIFICATIONS FOR CARE IN STATUTE IS THAT DOING SO LIMITS NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY. ALSO THE UNFUNDED MANDATES CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL RELATED TO SPECIFIC COURSES OF PRENATAL AND POST PARTUM CARE WITHOUT REGARD TO LOCAL STANDARDS ARE RESOURCES WILL BE EXTREMELY COSTLY ESPECIALLY THE SMALL COUNTIES NOT EVERY COUNTY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS LEVEL OF CARE WITHOUT EXTREMES BUDGETARY PRESSURE IT ON JUST RELATED TO IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC ITEMS ARE COURSES OF CARE IN FIFTY EIGHT DIVERSE COUNTIES. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST REGRETTABLY AT SPECS WE OPPOSE AB SEVEN THIRTY TWO. ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER LEAD WITNESS NOT LISTED SO DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER- FOLKS I KNOW THERE'S NO ONE IN THIS ROOM TO TESTIFY AGAINST IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO NEW PEOPLE IN THE ROOM- NO THE OTHER ROOM STILL EMPTY SO LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ON THE LINE.

THERE IS NO ONE SHOWING UP ON THE PHONE. SO I WILL COLIN CENTER JACKSON IN A MOMENT. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR INTRODUCING THIS I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT IN- I FIRST INTRODUCED A BILL AROUND SHACKLING OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN- JAILS AND PRISONS YEAH BACK IN I THINK WAS TO THE NINE. AND YET WE STOPPED THE PRACTICE AND- YOU KNOW WE WOULD NOT NEED TO DO THE START THE STATUTES IF. OUR COUNTY JAILS WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND ADOPTED THEIR OWN APPROPRIATE REGULATIONS WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT PREGNANCY THAT. THERE'S MANY MANY POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOT IN ANY WAY EVIDENT JUST LOOKING AT THE PREGNANT INDIVIDUAL THINGS LIKE HI SURE RIGHT IF THINKS THAT I. NUMBER CAN COMPLICATE THAT PREGNANCY AND CREATE VERY BAD OUTCOMES AND GIVEN. THAT IF A PERSON IS IN OUR CUSTODY WE MUST PROVIDE EVERY BIT OF. APPROPRIATE CARE FOLLOWING ALL THE MEDICAL GUIDELINES AND I DON'T THINK I COULD FIND ONE MEDICAL DOCTOR WHO WOULD TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO SHACKLE A PREGNANT WOMAN. HELLO I'M GLAD OF IT BEFORE AGAIN I HOPE THAT IT WILL FINALLY BE NOT ONLY ENACTED BUT SIGNED INTO LAW AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS SINCE IT'S NOW GOING ON FOR ME ELEVEN YEARS SENATOR JACKSON'S. WELL HI APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR AND TOO GOOD THING THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ISN'T IN THIS FORUM. AT THE MOMENT WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS BEFORE WITH THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION THE LACK OF RESPECT. THE ABSENCE OF ANY SEMBLANCE OF DIGNITY. THAT THESE WOMEN EXPERIENCE IS CHARGED ON ACCEPTABLE IN TODAY'S WORLD ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AS I WAS LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY. THE NOTION THAT WOMEN ARE SHACKLED DURING PREGNANCY THE NOTION THAT THEY ARE TREATED WITH SUCH DISDAIN AND HUMILIATION. AND THAT WE NOW ACTUALLY HAVE THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OBJECTING. TO LEGISLATION THAT WILL PROHIBIT SHACKLING THAT WILL PROHIBIT THE POLICIES THAT ARE CONTINUING TO BE CONDUCTED. OUR JAILS IS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING TO ME. AND FRANKLY DISGRACEFUL. AND I ASKED MYSELF HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE IN THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE EVER GIVEN BIRTH. BECAUSE YOU HAVE ARE. WHAT THAT EXPERIENCES LIKE AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN HUMILIATE AND DEGRADE WOMEN GOING THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE AND THEN COME TO THIS PLACE AN OBJECT TO SOME OF THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF HUMAN DIGNITY. THIS BILL CALLS FOR. THIS BILL DOESN'T ASK THAT THESE PEOPLE BE TREATED AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN HUMAN BEINGS. PREGNANT WOMEN GIVING BIRTH A NEW OPPOSE THIS. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. AND I AM EMBARRASSED FOR THIS ORGANIZATION AND SO SHOULD YOU BE WITHOUT I WILL MOVE THIS BILL. ANY TO A CENTER UNTIL THE TO LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT I'D LIKE TO CLOSE VERY AUDREY MINIMAL OUT HIS ME OF SENATOR MORE NON MORE LIKE YOU GO AHEAD. I'M. I GUESS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- PROVIDE THE WHOLE PICTURE THAT MAYBE THERE WERE SOME. JAILS AT WORK. OPERATING AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND I DON'T KNOW. IF THAT IN FIRST AT ALL JAILS ALL FIFTY COUNTY ARE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE SURE OF SIR. NOT PROVIDING THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT THAT IS NECESSARY AT THIS CRITICAL TIME SIDE. BUT SHOULD BE CAREFUL THAT. WE DON'T BLAST THE WHOLE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WHEN MAYBE. THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE- HAVE JUST ACTION POLICIES IN PLACE SO I. I JUST WHEN IT WHEN IT SAY THAT MADAM CHAIR BECAUSE- CENTER JACKSON I. HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY MAYBE ONE MENTAL INSTITUTION WAS NOT DOING WHAT WHICH POST READER. THAN ALL OF THEM WERE CLOSED AND NOW WE- A MASSIVE POPULATION ON OUR STREETS ARE. I JUST WANNA BE CAREFUL. AND SAY THANK YOU TO THE SHERIFF'S THAT ARE. DOING A GOOD JOB IN FEEL THIS IS A NECESSARY OFFENDED THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING. IMPLICATED OR THAT THEY ARE DOING THE JOB- AND I AND I APPOINTED A WOMAN SURE OF IN THE- SO- SO I JUST WANT TO. JUST GIVE IT IN IF I MAY CLARIFY. I THINK YOU. HAVE SENATOR MORE LOCKERS FINISH TO NOT TAKE YOUR MANAGER I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO THIS JACKSON. YEAH MY POINT WAS NOT AS I SHOULD THE ASSOCIATION. WHICH HAS COME BEFORE US TODAY IN OPPOSITION SHOW THE WITNESS WAS REPRESENTING THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION I AM SURE. THERE ARE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE CONDUCTING THEMSELVES IN A MUCH MORE HUMANE MANNER. BUT MY POINT MY COMMENTS WERE DIRECTED AT THIS ASSOCIATION THE CAME BEFORE US TODAY OBJECTING ON THE GROUNDS THAT WERE SET FORTH THAT THAT'S THE POINT I WANT TO BE CLEAR ENOUGH I WASN'T CLEAR MY APOLOGIES. IT IS THE FACT THAT THIS ASSOCIATION HAS REGISTERED FORMAL OPPOSITION AND TO FIGHT HERE TODAY. IN OPPOSITION THAT IS THE INITIATION THAT'S THE ENTITY THAT I WAS CALLING OUT NOT INDIVIDUAL SURE UPS AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT IF THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL SHERIFFS WHO SHARE MY EMBARRASSMENT THAT THIS ORGANIZATION COME OUT IN OPPOSITION AND ART CHELATED ITSELF SUCH THE DAY BIG GAP AND IT IS HOPED THAT THE- FORWARD. THE SURE SHOWS ASIAN ARM. ITS ROLE ALL SO GIVING PEOPLE THEIR DIGNITY SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN. BRADFORD YOU HAVE COMMON. I WAS JUST GONNA THAT WHICH AS SOON JOHN AND STATED I DON'T THINK SHE WAS CASTING ASPERSIONS ON ANY PARTICULAR BUT AS AN ASSOCIATION AND YOU COME OUT IN OPPOSITION TO. HUMANE TREATMENT. I THINK IT'S THE OBLIGATION OF THAT ASSOCIATION THEN TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR MEMBERS WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS. AND ASKS WHY ARE THE OPPOSING HUMANE TREATMENT BECAUSE I CAN ASSURE YOU IF MEN WERE GIVEN BIRTH THEY WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME FASHION. SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA I WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN RESPONSE TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION. IS THIS A PROBLEM OF ONE BAD JAIL- LET ME CLEAR FIVE THAT TO- THERE HAD BEEN SOME ISSUES AND A FEW COUNTIES WHICH I'M NOT GONNA NAME HERE BUT- IT'S CLEAR THAT A STATEWIDE SOLUTIONS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE QUALITY REPRODUCTIVE CARE YOU RECEIVE SHOULDN'T DEPEND UPON WHERE YOU HAPPEN TO BE ARRESTED IN WHERE YOU'RE INCARCERATED. SO WE STATEWIDE SOLUTION- IS IDENTIFIED AS THE AS THE PREFERRED A TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT BY THE ACLU ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE IN CAT CALIFORNIA COUNTY JAILS. DOCUMENTED NUMEROUS ABUSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. INCLUDING REQUIRING WOMEN TO GET PREGNANCY TESTING- WHEN THEY DIDN'T WANT THEM. FORCING A WOMAN REQUESTED AN ABORTION TO WAIT TWO MONTHS FOR THE PROCEDURE PUSHING HER IN A AT HER SECOND TIME TRIMESTER. JAIL STAFF ENCOURAGING SOME PREGNANT WOMEN TO GET ABORTIONS WHEN THEY DID NOT WANT THEM. PUTTING A WOMAN WHO WAS DESPONDENT WHEN RETURNING TO JAIL AFTER HAVING GIVEN BIRTH. AND THE ANSWER FOR HER BABY INTO THE HOLE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR THREE DAYS POST PARTUM. FORCING A WOMAN WHO HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH TO WALK UPSTAIRS TO AN UPPER TIER SALE. SO THOSE ARE SOME SPECIFIC CONCRETE EXAMPLES THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN COUNTY JAILS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I THINK THAT SAY- ARE SIMILAR TO THE WHAT ANGELICA'S PARTS. TESTIMONY SENATOR SKINNER YOU KNOW MY EXPERIENCE GOES BACK WITH THIS I HAD TO DO MY OWN MATH HERE THIRTY THREE YEARS AS A STAFFER HERE TO THE SENATE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE WHEN THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. VISITED CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN. AND I WOULD SUGGEST- THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT COST IT PERHAPS UNFUNDED MANDATE TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR- BROTHER SISTER ORGANIZATION THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM AND LOOK AT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LOST IN LAWSUITS. WHERE WOMEN SUED FOR INAPPROPRIATE- FROM FOR ABUSE DURING CHILDBIRTH AND ONE. CAN SELECT THEIR CONCERN IS A FISCAL ONE I WOULD SUGGEST- OUNCE OF PREVENTION MIGHT WORK- PRE VITAMIN A PRENATAL VITAMINS ARE PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. ALLOWING SOMEONE TO HELP LOWER BLOOD VERSUS THE UPPER BUNK HAS NO COST ALLOCATIONS. AND SO IF THERE CAN. IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAID OUT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PREGNANT WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED ABUSE IN THE STATE FACILITY WHICH IS WHY. ON AT DATE. WE KNOW HAVE THESE ISSUES. ON THE FACT THAT WE ARE DEBATING. THE APPROACH TO SHACKLE SOMEONE TO A BED OR BELLY CHAIN SOMEONE IN TRANSPORT TO DELIVER A BABY IN TWENTY TWENTY- IS BEYOND THE PALE. YOU KNOW THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION I BELIEVE IS A DEMOCRATIC BODY THAT SURE EXCEPT TO VOTE AND MAKE A DECISION ON THE POSITION THEY TAKE ON BILLS AND I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF SHERIFF'S ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WHO PERHAPS ARE MALE UNDERSTAND THEIR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PROVIDING CARE AND HEALTH DELIVERY SERVICES TO ALL INMATES WITHIN THEIR CUSTODY BE THEY MALE OR FEMALE WITH THAT- MADAM CHAIR ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- SENATOR MITCHELL THAT IS A MOTION OF DO YOU PASS TO APPROACH SEND. MINORITY SPOKE BUT BEFORE WE TAKE THE VOTE EVEN THOSE COUNTIES THAT. MAY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A GOOD RULE OR GOOD DRUG GOOD PRACTICES HAVE FALLEN SHORT IN MY OWN COUNTY. THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO IS PUT IN THE HOLE WHO IS PREGNANT WHO THEY FELT- PERHAPS FOR A DISCIPLINARY REASONS. AND SHE ENDED UP GIVING BIRTH ALONE WHILE SHE WAS IN THAT SOLITARY CELL. AFTER A REPORTEDLY CALLING OUT MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAVING NO ONE RESPOND AND SO SHE WAS LEFT THERE AND THEY DID NOT- THEY FOUND HER LATER. IN THE CELL. WITH THE NEWLY BORN CHILD SO EVEN IN THOSE COUNTIES THAT REPORTEDLY HAVE ADOPTED GOOD PROCEDURES ARE PRACTICES WE FIND THESE ARE. ACTUALLY INEXCUSABLE CIRCUMSTANCES SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROACH HIM WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL. AB SEVEN THIRTY TWO BONTA DEPRESSED APPROPRIATION MOTION WAS MADE BY SENATOR JACKSON'S SKINNER. FIVE IN OUR AYE MORLOCK.

I HAVE NO ONE SHOWING UP ON THE PHONE AT THIS TIME- LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. GO AHEAD SENATOR JACKSON'S. I APOLOGIZE I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR THE- IS I UNDERSTAND IT THIS FOR THIS MEASURE REQUIRES AN AGENCY THAT CONDUCTS AN INVESTIGATION TO DISCLOSE ITS FINDINGS. NO LATER THAN OF THE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION. TO WHOM ARE THESE FINDING SUPPOSED TO BE DISCLOSED. SENATOR WIENER I CAN PROBABLY ANSWER THAT. IF YOU WOULD IT'S AN AMENDMENT TO THE- TO THE PROVISIONS THAT WERE IN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE SO IT IS JUST A TIMING ISSUE OF WHEN THE RECORDS COULD BE AVAILABLE SO IN OTHER WORDS. THE. THE IN IT THIS BILL ONLY AFFECTS THOSE RECORDS THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. SO IT- WHAT IT WHAT IT PROVIDES FOR IS THAT. ONCE THE- INVESTIGATION IS CONCLUDED THAT THEN OF COURSE ANY RECORDS REQUEST WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE RECORDS AND THE PROBLEM HERE IS. IF YOU HAVE AN OFFICER WHO RESIGNED AIMS TO IN ORDER TO TERMINATE THE INVESTIGATION WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS IN IRAQ. RECORDS NEVER GOT RELEASED BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER CONCLUSION. TO THE INVESTIGATION AND SERVICE FOR CHOIR THE AGENCY TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION EVEN IF THEY'RE OFFICER RESIGNS COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION AND THEN THOSE BECOME DIFFICULT PLAN OF THE CRITERIA PUBLIC RECORDS PUBLIC RECORDS OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IT WAS NOT CLEAR BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. IF THE PERSON AND GOES TO A NEW EMPLOYER- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE INFORMATION BE READILY ACCESSED AND THERE IS. SEVERAL THAT SENT TO BROWN. IS PURSUING TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT THIS WILL BE HELPFUL NOT JUST FOR SUBSEQUENT AGENCIES- BUT ALSO FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC THANK YOU. THE FIVE. THESE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE ARE BILL THAT PROVIDED FOR THE RECORDS DID NOT ON I WOULDN'T SAY IT DIDN'T ANTICIPATED JUST DID NOT ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR OFFICERS TO LEAVE AN AGENCY PRIOR TO- AN INVESTIGATION OR EVEN BEFORE ONE BEGAN SO THIS IS TO CORRECT THAT I ALSO HAVE A BILL IN THIS SECTION SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WHICH WOULD CORRECT IT FURTHER. INSURER THAT ANY RECORDS ON AN OFFICER WHO LEFT IN AGENCY FOLLOWS THEM AND GOES TO THE NEXT AGENCY SO ENDED ALSO EXPANDS WHAT CATEGORIES THAT OUR RECORDS MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BUT IT DEALS WITH THIS- ON A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN AYE DEFIED THAT SOMETIMES EIGHTY AGENCY WILL COME TO AGREEMENT WITH AN OFFICER TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THEIR POSITION. AND THE- EITHER A DISCIPLINE IS NOT FULLY COMPLETED OR INVESTIGATIONS NOT COMPLETED AND THUS A RECORD IS NOT- EITHER DOES GO TO THE NEXT AGENCY OR AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SO THIS BILL CORRECTS A CERTAIN VERSION OF IT AND THEN- I HAVE A BILL SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX THAT WOULD CORRECT ADDITION PERSONS AND CENTER BRADFORD HAS A BILL THAT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN RECORDS IT DEALS WITH SCEPTRE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ARE FROM MEMBERS. RIGHT SEEING NINE WE HAVE A WE HAVE I BELIEVE WE HAVE MOTION DID I HEAR MOTION ALMOST ALL RIGHT TO SENATOR JACKSON HAS MOVED. AB FIFTEEN NINETY NINE.

NINETEEN SIXTY THREE SORRY WHAT DO I DO. FLORA RHIM APOLOGIES SORRY. BURGER THAT'S RIGHT NO WE NEED TO BECAUSE OF THEIR WITNESSES APOLOGIES. YEAH WE ALL DO ALRIGHT SO I SKIPPED ITEM TEN I DON'T KNOW HOW TO COUNT SO WE'RE GOING TO FILE ITEM TEN WHICH IS AB NINETEEN FIFTY IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM LONGER WHICH SENATOR MITCHELL IS PRESENTING. GO AHEAD SENATOR MITCHELL. AND THIS IS AB NINETEEN FIFTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I'M PRESENTING TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAMLAGER AB NINETEEN FIFTY THIS BILL IS ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS PRIORITY BILLS IT WOULD SET A MAXIMUM PROBATION PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FOR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES AND TWO YEARS FOR SOME FELONY OFFENSES. THE BILL EXEMPTS CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST MONETARY PROPERTY VALUED AT OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ANY SPECIFIC CRIMES OF PROBATION TERM LINKS IDENTIFIED BY STATUTE WHICH INCLUDE THE WISE AND STRIKE FELONY OFFENSES. MANY SEX CRIMES ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR PROBATION BY STATUTE UNDER CURRENT PENAL CALLED. THESE ARE ALSO EXAM. UNDER THIS BILL AB NINETEEN FIFTY CREATES REASONABLE AN EVIDENCE BASE LIMITS ON PROBATION TERMS WHILE LOWERING COSTS TO TAXPAYERS ALLOWING FOR THE POSSIBLE INVESTMENT OF SAVINGS AND A FOR MEASURES PROVEN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND INCREASED PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AB NINETEEN FIFTY OFFERS A SLIDING SCALE APPROACH SUPPORTING SUCCESS OVER PUNISHMENT. IT RETAINSJUDICIAL DISCRETION AND RECOGNIZES THAT PROBATION CAN STILL BE REVOKED FOR SUBSTANTIVE VIOLATIONS THE STATUS QUO HAVE TO CHANGE PROBATION IS RACIAL CULTURAL REGIONAL CLASS BASED AN ARBITRARY CRIPPLING SUB CULTURES AND ECONOMIES ACROSS THE STATE. HAITIAN. IS A GENERATIONAL CURSE IT THE BILL OF SPELL A CHILD HAS TO WATCH HIS OR HER MOTHER IN DOING THE FRUSTRATION OF FIGURED OUT WHERE TO LIVE AND WHERE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT ALL WITH ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS THAT MAKE THESE TASKS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT THAN THEY ALREADY ARE. AND YOUR PROBATION IS ALSO THE MOST WIDELY USED FORM OF CORRECTIONAL CONTROL IN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S A SUPERVISED PROBATION POPULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX THOUSAND IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE NATION MORE THAN TWICE THE SIZE OF THE STATE'S PRISON POPULATION. ALMOST FOUR TIMES LARGER THAN THE JAIL POPULATION AND SIX TIMES LARGER THAN ITS PAROLE POPULATION. A CLOG THE COURTS MORE THAN ANY OTHER FORM OF SUPERVISION. A PROBATION TERM MAY REQUIRE THAT YOU CONTINUOUSLY SEEK TO MAINTAIN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT YOUR ABILITY TO TRAVEL ACROSS COUNTY LINES MAY BE RESTRICTED OR YOU MAY BE SUBMITTED TO A SEARCH OF YOUR PERSONAL HOME WITHOUT WARNING. YOU MAY BE IN VIOLATION OF YOUR TERMS IF YOU'RE LATE OR YOU MISS AN APPOINTMENT IN IRAQ WITH A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER RIGHT IN THE FRONT SEAT OF A CAR OR GET PREGNANT. BEING ON PROBATION CAN FEEL LIKE LIVING IN QUICKSAND. PROBATION DEPARTMENTS MICRO MANAGE PEOPLE AND APPLY HAPHAZARD RULES DESIGNED TO IT EVIDENTLY CATCH PEOPLE COMMITTING CRIMES. CRIMES THAT PEOPLE NOT ON PROBATION WOULDN'T THINK TWICE ABOUT. 20% OF PRISON ADMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE THE RESULT OF SUPERVISED PROBATION VIOLATIONS THE STATE SPENDS TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE FOR SUPERVISION VIOLATIONS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PROBATION SERVICES SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND ADDICTION TREATMENT ARE MOST AFFECTED DURING THE FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF SUPERVISION PROVIDE AN INCREASE THE PROVISION AND SERVICES EARLIER REDUCES AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIKELIHOOD TO RESET OF EIGHT. THE LONGER PROBATION TERM THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS FOR TAXPAYERS. AND LESS EFFECTIVE. AND THAT THOSE WHO COMMITTED NO CRIME DO SO WITHIN THE FIRST TWO YEARS WHERE THEY CAN BE CHARGED. THIS BILL PROVIDES THE IMPETUS FOR COUNTIES TO REDESIGN PROBATION PROGRAMS BASED ON PRESUMING SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES RATHER THAN COUNTING ON FAILURES. COUNTY LIKE CONTRA COSTA AND STATES LIKE LOUISIANA AND MICHIGAN ARE ALREADY RETHINKING PROBATION. JUDGES HAVE CHOSEN TO LOWER PROBATION TERMS TO TWO YEARS PROBATION DEPARTMENTS HAVE FRONT LOADED TREATMENT AND SERVICES AND I'VE BEEN MORE ROBUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO TREATMENT RATHER THAN THE GOTCHA APPROACHES THAT VIOLATIONS- EVOKE. AND THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE STATE CERTAINLY THAT ARE CONSDERED SOFT ON CRIME THEY ARE REFORMING PROBATION BECAUSE THE COSTS AND FAILURE RATES ARE TOO HIGH. THEY ARE REFORMING PROBATION BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO STOP BLAMING PEOPLE ON PROBATION AND START LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM ITSELF. YOU CAN ACHIEVE A LOT IN ONE OR TWO YEARS WITH ROBUST PROGRAMMING IN REAL MASHABLE'S ONE YEAR TWO YEARS CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE TERM. AB NINETEEN FIFTY SAYS THE PROBATION OFFICERS RATHER THAN KIOSKS SHOULD BE GUIDING PROBATIONERS THROUGH TREATMENT. RISK IN NEED ASSESSMENT TOOL SHOULD BE REGULARLY USED IN ADJUSTED FEWER PEOPLE ON PROBATION MEANS A LIGHTER BUT POTENTIALLY MORE INTENSIVE CASELOADS FOR OFFICES CAN FOCUS QUALITY TIME TO RESOURCES. ON THEIR CLIENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHALLENGES US TO ENVISION A NEW NORMAL WHERE JUSTICE IS RESTORATIVE AND REHABILITATIVE ROOTED IN RESEARCH FACTS AND FIGURES. AND A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS IS REALLY IN SUFFICIENT. A NEW NORMAL WERE SUPERVISION IS NOT ABOUT HOW LONG SOMEONE'S TERMINUS BUT RATHER THE QUALITY OF THEIR EXPERIENCE AND HOW MEANINGFUL IT IS- WE HAVE SEVERAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. REPRESENTS FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE ON AS WELL AS THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER OF ALAMEDA COUNTY MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU A CENTER MICH FOR PRESENTING WE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINE NOW FOR OUR FIRST LEAD WITNESS A WHICH I BELIEVE IS WINDY STILL CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING ARE HONORABLE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS WHEN IT'S STILL AND I'M TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FIFTY TODAY AS A CRIMINOLOGIST. AND BASED UPON APPROXIMATELY THIRTY YEARS WORKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION INCLUDING EXPERIENCE AS AN ADMINISTRATOR CREATING RESPONSE EVERY. REENTRY PROGRAMS FOR INMATES AND OVER NINE YEARS EXPERIENCE AS THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER PREVIOUSLY FOR EXAMPLE DOES GO AND NOW ALAMEDA COUNTY. CERTAINLY DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED ADULT PROBATIONERS AB NINETEEN FIFTY IS AN IMPORTANT BEGINNING TO REFORM ACT REFORMING COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PROBATION SUPERVISION LENGTH WHICH ROUTINE BY STATUTE OR IMPOSED IN A STANDARD THREE YEAR OR OVER SUPERVISION TERMS REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CRIME. RESEARCH PROVES THAT THE DURATION OF PROBATION SUPERVISION TERM IS NOT THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE PROBATIONER THE QUALITY AND TYPE OF SUPERVISION OUR SYSTEM OF SUPERVISION BASED UPON THE DIRECT LINKAGE TO PROGRAMS SERVICES AND TREATMENT. THE CLIENT OFFICER RELATIONSHIP AND THE DOSAGE OF PROGRAMMING ARE THE FACTORS THAT INCREASE OR DIMINISH THE INDIVIDUAL SUCCESS COMES TO PROVISION. ALSO RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE YEARS EXPERIENCE WHILE AN INDIVIDUAL IS ON PROBATION SUPERVISION CAN INCREASE A PROBATIONER CHRIS CAN TELL YOUR AB NINETEEN FIFTY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN RESHAPING COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SUPERVISION OF MISDEMEANOR RECKLESS FELONY CRIME. THERE ARE SOME MISDEMEANOR CRIMES WHICH DO NEED INCREASED SUPERVISION AREAS AS AN EXAMPLE THOSE RELATED TO THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HER ELDER OR CHILD ABUSE WELL THE MAJORITY OF MISDEMEANOR CRIMES DO NOT. MANY FELONY CRIMES ALSO DO NOT NEED A STANDARD THREE YEAR OVER SUPERVISION TERM HOWEVER SOME CRIMES DO CALL FOR LONGER THE PROVISION TERM TEXAS. ENVIRONMENT FELONY CRIMES ASSOCIATED WITH PENAL CODE SIX SEVEN POINT FIVE NEED LONGER THREE YEARS. TERMS AB FIFTY EIGHT NINETEEN FIFTY RECOGNIZES AND ADDRESSES THE DIFFERENCE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS UNDER PROBATION SUPERVISION WILL PROVIDE OFFICERS WITH MORE TIME TO WORK WITH CLIENTS. PHILIPPINE INDIVIDUALIZED PLANS AND ENABLE OFFICERS CONNECT FINANCE WITH EMPLOYMENT HOUSING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OTHER IMPORTANT SERVICES QUICKLY AND PROVIDING THE INDIVIDUALIZED CLIENT SUPPORT NEEDED WHICH WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE SUCCESS A PROBATIONER AND ALSO REDUCE VICTIMIZATION AB NINETEEN FIFTY WILL ALSO SUPPORT PROBATION OFFICER. AND COMPLAINING TO THE DUTIES THEIR JOB MORE EFFECTIVELY BY REDUCING AND MAKING THEIR CASE LOADS MORE MANAGEABLE IN TWENTY TEN THE LEGISLATURE. ENACTED AND EIGHT EVIDENCE BASED PRO SUPERVISION AND ALLOW A LIKE A ENACTED A ONE NINE PUBLIC WE- THESE ARE BOTH MILE WITH OF THE- CHEN THAT. AB NINETEEN FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPLEMENT THE NEXT MILESTONE REFORM THAT WILL CREATE A NEW NORMAL WITH THE PROVISION IS NOT A HOW LONG SOMEONE'S TERM IS. BUT RATHER ABOUT HOW MEANINGFUL IN. REMAIN EXPERIENCING. IT IS COULD THAT TIME ALONG WITH REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INTO DOING OUT OF TIME AND- YOUR RESOURCES PROVIDE BY AND SIX. EIGHT IS NOT ONLY GIVE OUT OF TO READ. WE'RE OP. FOR CROWD OF TIME OPERATE PLEASE IT THERE'S ANOTHER LEAD WENT YOU'VE USED MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. POLICY I HAVE STATED THAT ALL. BILLS ONLY MINUTES TOTAL LEAD AND THERE'S ANOTHER LEAD WITNESS SO I'M GOING TO TURN NOW TO THE NEXT LEAD WITNESS. AND EVEN THOUGH THE TIME WAS USED UP I'M GOING TO ALLOW THE NEXT LEAD WITNESS FORTY FIVE SECONDS POLICIES GO AHEAD. OF MISTER RISE YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE MEMBERS MY NAME IS A NOTE ARE SHOWN ON THE ELECTED PUBLIC DEFENDER OF SAN FRANCISCO A POLICE TO BE SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. THAT CAN FIFTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER. BLOGGER IT'S TIME TO GET REAL IF. PROBATION IS WORKING WE SHOULD NEED EXTENSIVE TIME TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES AS PUBLIC DEFENDERS WE FREQUENTLY SEE FORMER CLIENTS OF OURS WHO HAVE FOUGHT LONG AND HARD ALONG SIDE. WE FOUGHT BARGAIN ARE LONG SET OF TO EARN THEIR FREEDOM CYCLE BACK INTO THE SYSTEM SIMPLY DUE TO SOME TECHNICAL VIOLATION. OF THEIR PROBATION CONDITIONS- THESE TECHNICAL CONDITIONS COULD BE MISSING APPOINTMENT ALTHOUGH ONE MORE THAN ONE CLIENT OF MINE HAS TOLD ME THEY TRIED TO REACH A PROBATION OFFICER. WHOSE VOTES VOICE MAIL WAS FULL. TO UNPAID FEINSTEIN NOT MEETING THESE ARE VIOLATION PAPER IN ON. WHEN VIOLATIONS THE HAPPENED. IN THE PROBATION PERIOD SO THERE'S NO NEED TO HAVE THAT EXTENSION SECONDLY PROBE PAROLE AND PROBATION VIOLATION SPEND A COSTS IN THE STATE APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. ANNUALLY THE HUGE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE JAIL TERM PROBLEM IT'S BECOME MUCH MORE WELL KNOWN ISSUE AND A- DEEP CONCERN DURING THIS CORONA VIRUS. TIMES THERE ARE SO MANY LOW POINTS IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE HIGHEST POINTS IS SEEING CLIENTS SUCCESSFULLY.

SUPPORTED THE GOVERNOR IN THE STATE BUDGET HE PROPOSED SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR AND WHAT HE NEED TO POINT OUT AND OUT TO THE AUTHOR IS THAT. PERHAPS LEGISLATION ANGELINA. HARD ACT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE FROM VOTING SERVICE IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE LARGELY SO WITH KOBE OPENED LAST IT'S IMPORTANT TO THAT IS THE ALL TO INCARCERATE. ARE WORK ARGUE THIS REALLY PROVIDE THE PATHWAYS BOTH THE A BILL PIECE IT'S EXPECT BY THE CAN AND VICTIMS AT WELL AS THE P. THAT BE GREEN EXPECTED BY CLIENTS WHEN THEY COME INTO OUR WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT'S OUR MISSION THAT'S OUR FOCAL POINT IS THAT PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY COMES THROUGH US HELPING TO HEAL- PEOPLE THAT COME TO US AS A RESULT OF THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- BUT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ALL MODES THAT SIDE OF THE CREEK BECOMING JUST ASSIST. COLOR AND LOGICALLY THERE WOULD BE. UPS I SHOULD SAY LIKE A SUPER WILL DESTROY IN THAT POPPED AS WELL SHORT TERM THEREFORE LIKELY IMPROVE THOSE CONDITIONS- BUT UNDERSTAND PROBATION DOESN'T CHOOSE WHO WE WORK WITH THEIR DELIVERED TO US BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WE DON'T CHOOSE HOW LONG THEY STAY ON PROBATION THAT WAS DELIVERED TO US BY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO WHERE IS NEEDED GREED THE PROBATION BLANKS IN MANY. INSTANCES BUT IN SHOULD BE SHORTER WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO FRONT LOAD THE SYSTEM WITH SERVICES THAT YOU MAY IN FACT PRODUCE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF CAUSING PEOPLE TO GO DEEPER INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BY NOT PROVIDING THE REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY NEED. TO SHIFT COURSE THEY DON'T RECEIVE WHAT THEY ARE EIGHTEEN ON A LIMITED TIME FOR THE D. H. NEED TO WRAP UP.

NO CHANGES IN WHO IS IN THE ROOM SO- KLAY HERE WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SENIOR AND WE CAN NOW. TURN TO MY COLLEAGUES IF ANYONE HAS ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. A CENTER WIENER GO AHEAD I THANK YOU ON I FULLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I KNOW WE FOCUS A LOT ON. REDUCING OUR PRISON POPULATION ARE FOR SO MANY REASONS- WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT CALIFORNIA. WITH HIS REPORTED ONE BACK UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS. FIVE PROGRESS BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY WE HAD TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE. DIE IN PRISON AND WE RE NOT ANY SAFER TODAY THAN WE WERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. FIVE THREE TO CONTINUE TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE PRISON POPULATIONS AND CLOSE DOWN PRISONS AND- STOP SPENDING SO MUCH ON PRISONS BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS- PROBATION. AND WE HAVE- CENTER MENTAL INDICATED BEGINNING AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE. ON PROBATION AND ALL PROVISION IS NOT. AS DAMAGING BUT IS INCARCERATION. IT STILL IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND IT'S STILL DRAMATICALLY IMPACTS PEOPLE'S LIVES. WHEN YOU DREAM MORE EFFECTIVE ABOUT THIS WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE INFORMATION AS LONG AS THEY ARE AND THIS IS A GOOD DEAL I SUPPORT CENTER JACKSON. IS AT I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF TIME I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE THE PROBATION IS A BAD THING- I THINK WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT TO AND DONE WELL IT IS VERY VERY HELPFUL TO PEOPLE. WHO ARE TRYING TO TRANSIT TRANSITION BACK INTO NORMAL- LAW ABIDING. LIFE STYLES AND EXPERIENCE- I'VE BEEN A CHATTING WITH THE WITH THE CHI PROBATION OFFICERS AND BOTH COUNTIES AND IN PARTICULAR SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THE- THE FACT THERE IT IS- THAT THE- SERIOUSLY THAT ANY SERIOUS PROBATION VIOLATIONS. ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR- WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. ALL OF A PERSON'S- A PROBATIONARY PERIOD AND THERE AFTER THE PROBATIONER ASSEMBLY HAS WHAT ARE FRANKLY UNNECESSARY IN STRESSFUL PRESSURES TO COMPLY WITH THESE LITTLE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE THINGS THAT SEND PEOPLE BACK TO PRISON WILL HAPPEN FAIRLY QUICKLY AFTER THEY ARE RELEASED IT FOR THEIR GONNA HAPPEN AT ALL AND IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS SHE IS THAT. THE LENGTH OF TERMS ARE SO LONG PROBATION OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A HUGE NUMBERS TO WHAT THEY CALL BANKS FILES. THAT THEY DON'T WORK THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEIR IT IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE USE OF THEIR TIME. THERE'S NO ACTIVE SUPERVISION AND THEN OF COURSE YOU GET A TRAFFIC TICKET THREE FOUR YEARS LATER BLOOM. BACK TO INCARCERATION YOU GO WHICH WHICH MAKES NO SENSE FRANKLY- BUT I WAS WONDERING. OUR END BECAUSE THE AUTHORS IN HERE I JUST LIKE TO SUGGEST. THAT AT LEAST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE FOLKS THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH- THEY'D LIKE TO CONSIDER AND HAVE US CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS. OF SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FUNDING IS STABILIZE FOR OF THE CHEST THEIR CASELOAD CHANGES IF THIS MEASURE PASSES. AND TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN PROVIDE THAT TREATMENT AND SUPERVISION REQUIRED TO BE DELIVERED QUICKLY ENOUGH DURING THAT JORDAN SHOULD. PATIENT PERIOD IN OTHER WORDS THE GOAL HERE IS SUCCESS. AND IN ORDER TO HAVE SO THIS TREATMENT PASSED TO OCCUR FAIRLY QUICKLY UPON RELEASE AND SO THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE. AND IT'S MY WHOLE BY CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE BUT IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT THIS BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IF IT ISN'T WILL KINDA KNEE JERK BACK TO THE OLD SYSTEM. SYSTEM WE BELIEVE. IN HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AROUND THE WORLD IN IN IN OTHER STATES IN OUR COUNTRY THOSE WORK. IT DOES WORK BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATELY AND EFFECTIVELY SO THAT IT DOES WORK SO THAT WE DON'TFIND OURSELVES. FEELING THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT- SIMPLY PUTS PEOPLE AWAY AND WHERE HOUSE SYSTEM AND- GETS THEM OUT OF OUR IMMEDIATE VISION. ONLY TO SEE THAT THEY WILL COME BACK OR THAT THE NEXT GENERATION WILL COME- THIS EIGHT. WHEN APPROACH. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESORT TO THERE SO CAN BE PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED SO. BY I WILL ASK THE- AT SOME POINT WE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION TO MAKE SURE THE RESOURCES ARE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE SO WITH THIS PROGRAM CAN WORK IN WITH THAT- I WOULD. HAPPILY AND MOVE THE BILL. THE CENTER MITCHELL YOU YOU CAN RESPOND IF YOU CHOOSE TO BUT YOU KNOW HOW DO AND I'LL DO INCLUDE YOUR CLOTHES OKAY I'LL BE PREPARED TO IN CLOSING OKAY GREAT SENATOR. WIENER THAT YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY NOT. SUGGESTING THAT PROVISION IS BAD REGION CAN BE DONE AN EXCELLENT WAY AND SENT US IN THE STILL USED TO RUN OUR ADULT PROBATION DEPARTMENT SAN FRANCISCO. AND IT'S A GREAT MODEL FOR GIVING PEOPLE ACCESS A RESOURCE AND SERVICES BASED MODEL SO- BUT IT CAN BE TOO LONG. ANY OTHER- YES SENATOR- MORE LUCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I SEE A HOUSE DIVIDED IT PROBATION OFFICERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ARGUMENT SO I. BUT ME AND MY- COMMENTARIES I DON'T SEE ANY. POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. I HAVE HAD IT HERE HAS YOUR OFFICE BEEN CONTACTED OLD. OR DESERVE THE- PRESENTER OF THE BILL HAVE ANY THE ENDING OF WHAT MAY BE THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ARE RECOMMENDING ON THIS PARTICULAR THING LIKE SIGNIFICATIVA SHARE YEAH I DIDN'T SEE ANY REFERENCES IN THE ANALYSIS ANY AND I CERTAINLY AM NOT IN RECEIPT OF ANY- OFFICIAL POSITION THANK YOU. BUT IS THE GENERAL QUESTION WE COMMONLY DO HERE FROM THE JUDGES ARE JUDGES COUNSELING BILLS AND WE DID NOT ON THE TWENTY. PERHAPS SENATOR MITCHELL BEFORE I GIVE YOU THE FLOOR TO CLOSE I WOULD SAY THAT EVEN WITH GREAT PROGRAMMING. LONG BLANKS APPROPRIATION TO NOT SERVE A PERSON SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF LIMITATIONS THAT ARE PUT ON YOU WHEN YOU WERE UNDER PROBATION AND SO TO SUCCEED IN BACK FULLY IN RE ENTRY YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET EMPLOYMENT TO GET EDUCATION TO GET. OUT YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WHILE YOU'RE UNDER INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED SUPERVISION THAT WHILE YOU'RE UNDERSERVED SUPERVISION YOU CAN BE PROHIBITED FROM SO JUST BY ITS VERY NATURE EVEN UNDER THE BEST TYPE OF PROGRAM CAN GRAY IN A PERSON'S ABILITY TO IN FACT SUCCEED SO I THINK A SHORTENING IT BEFORE INTENTION IS TO HAVE PEOPLE. BUT I'D BE FULLY EMPLOYED IN FULLY SUCCEED IS VERY VICE BUT- SENATOR MITCHELL YOU GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE- HEARTY DIALOGUE AND LET ME START BY SAYING THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE. PROBATION DONE WELL IS AN APT ENTERED COMPONENT EVERY ENTRY- SHE WOULD AGREE- SENATOR JACK FROM THAT IT'S AN ABSOLUTE ASSET. AND I AND I'M SURE THEY SHOULD BE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING ISSUE AT A LATER DATE BUT LET'S BE CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW IN LA COUNTY THE SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT DOLLARS HAVEN'T ALL BEEN SPENT AND SO PROBABLY IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT FOR THE MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL COUNTIES ARE SPENDING THOSE DOLLARS ON THE FRONT IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. ABSOLUTELY NOT HER DESIRE TO REDUCE FUNDING- SHE WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WITH THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER WHO SPOKE OPPOSITION THAT IT IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION BUT THAT IS THEIR MISSION BUT IF THAT'S THEIR MISSION WHY ARE WE ALLOWING MINOR TECHNICAL VIOLATE VIOLATIONS TO THE ONLY PEOPLE BACK TO INCARCERATION I THINK THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MEASURE IS TO BE TRUE TO THE TRUE MISSION AND INTENT AND DESIGN OF WHAT PROBATION IS ALL ABOUT. IN RESPONSE TO THE OPPOSITION FROM THE I'M DIFFICULT TRANSOCEAN THAT'S TRUE AND JUDGE CAN ORDER A TWO YEAR OR LESS PROBATION PERIOD THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO REDESIGN PROBATION SO THOSE TWO YEARS ARE SPENT. IN A MEANINGFUL AND PROFOUND WAY A JUDGE COULD ORDER TWO YEARS PROBATION NOW BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO FRONT LOAD ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES AND SERVICES. SAW THOSE TWO YEARS. CAN BE THE MOST IMPACTFUL THEY ALSO ARGUE THAT A- A PERSON CAN. IF THEY FINISH WITH ALL OF THEIR PROGRAMMING THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE COURTS TO ASK FOR TERMINATION. I WOULD QUESTION THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THAT HAPPENS KNOWING THAT HOW BACKED UP OUR COURT DOCKETS ARE AND I WONDER IF PROBATIONERS EVEN NOW. THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK AND TRY TO SHORTEN YOUR TERM AGAIN IT MISSES THE POINT THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO FRONT LOAD THE RESOURCES FULL FULL FULL FIRST TWO YEARS OUR MOST IMPORTANT. I AGREE WITH YOU SAID IN A MORE LIKE I DO THINK IT'S AN INTEREST INTERESTING THAT THE HOUSE IS DIVIDED. ON TO HEAR FROM. A BIG COUNTY THE GALLEY OF ALAMEDA SPEAK FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT HOW THIS WORKS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT- I THINK SPEAKS VOLUMES. FOR THE NEED TO REIMAGINE WE ENVISION WHAT IT TRULY AFFECTED PROBATION DEPARTMENT AND EXPERIENCE CAN BE. AGAIN I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS SHOWN HER WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATION- WITH- OF THOSE IN OUR POSITIONS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE JUDGES ARE NEUTRAL. BUT THEY'RE SUPPORTIVE CERTAIN CAUGHT. THREE DIED IN THIS NOTION FRONT LOW REESE. AND DESIGN OF DEPARTMENT CHILLY MEETS THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO REALLY. ISN'T ALL WITH THAT AGAIN I ASK AND I VOTE. ON A B. NINETEEN FOR. I WE ARE. FROM JACK. THE BILL THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO A PRO. SEEING NO OTHER COMMENT WE WILL. CALL FOR THE ROLE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN RISON PRESENTING TWENTY ONE AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN. AND THE AUTHOR HAS ASKED ME TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THE HELP THEY HAVE- PROVIDED IN GETTING THIS MEASURE TO WORD IS TODAY I WILL BE ACCEPTING. THE RECOMMENDED- AMENDMENTS FOR FROM THE ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN THE STREET FOR MEASURE THAT ALLOWS FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATED AT ONE OF THE CD OURS CONSERVATION FAR CAMPS TO APPLY FOR EXPUNGEMENT. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE VETTED BY THIS DR STRICT CRITERION DURING OUR FIRE SEASON. PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES THEY ARE THEY ALL EARNED THEIR RIGHT TO WORK BY EXHIBITING NON VIOLENT BEHAVIOR AND CONFORMING TO ALL RULES IN ADDITION ONLY THOSE WITH MINIMUM CUSTODY. STATUS ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOLUNTEER SOME CONVICTION OFFENSES SUCH AS SEXUAL OFFENSES FENCES. ARSON AND ANY HISTORY OF ESCAPE WHAT FORCE OR VIOLENCE AUTOMATICALLY MAKE AN INDIVIDUAL INELIGIBLE FOR CONSERVATION CAMPUS SIMONS EVEN IF THE INDIVIDUAL'S MINIMAL CUTS THE STATUS. THE VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS OR ON THE PATH THE REHABILITATION BUT THEY CANNOT. REACH TRUE REHABILITATION WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT ONE THREE LIST. IF WE REALLY WANT TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE AND WAR ARE RECIDIVISM RATES WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE SYSTEMATIC POLICY SUPPRESSING OUR COMMUNITIES. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN DOES JUST THAT IT WOULD ADD MUCH NEEDED BALANCE TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM EL ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ARE COMFORTABLE. I'M NOT FOR THE CALL ON TO HELP FIGHT FIRES TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK AN EXPUNGEMENT. IT IS A GRAVE INJUSTICE TO OUR LEGAL SYSTEM THAT WE- DEEM INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS FIT TO FIGHT FIRES FOR LITTLE OR NO PAY WHILE THEY AREN'T THE ONLINE ON OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED THEY MUST FACED INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN EARN ALMOST LIVING. FOR DOING THE SAME WORK. ONLINE WE HAVE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IS KATIE TEN TOLL. CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF LAW AND DIRECTOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE CLINIC AT UC IRVINE LAW SCHOOL. WE ALSO HAVE A CLARION VOICE TO WHAT SECOND CHANCES REALLY LOOK LIKE IN THE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT BEING A CIVIL NOON US WOULD COPE FIFTY CUT FIFTY ON BEHALF AND ANTONIO WELLINGTON. ALL WILD LAND FIREFIGHTER FROM EL DORADO COUNTY. AS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD TO PRACTICE. REBEL TO IN THE PRACTICE OF REAL BILL TATIAN WE MUST GIVE INDIVIDUALS A TO Z. NEED TO SUCCEED IN SOCIETY. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN IS INSTILLING HOPE INTO CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM GIVING INDIVIDUALS OPPORTUNITY. PROBABLY REINTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY. ON THAT NOTE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD WILL GO TO THE FIRST WITNESS AND- I BELIEVE THOSE ANTONIO WELLINGTON. GO AHEAD ANTONIO. THANK YOUR HONOR THIS IS KATIE TEND TO I BELIEVE I'M THE FIRST WITNESS OKAY GO AHEAD KATIE GO AHEAD. THANKS THE MORNING KEREN MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATIE TENTO AND I'M A CO PROFESSOR OF LAW DIRECTOR OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE CLINIC AT UC IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW. THROUGH THE CLINIC I REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SEEKING TO EXPUNGE THEIR CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BARRIERS AND HURDLES FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS FACE WHEN SEEKING TO MOVE ON FROM PAST MISTAKES. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN PROVIDING FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL THE PATHWAY TO EXPUNGE THEIR CONVICTIONS. HOWEVER INDIVIDUALS WEE CONVICTED OF FELONIES STILL FACE AN ENORMOUS BARRIERS IN GETTING THIS RELIEF AND OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTIES FINDING MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO KNOW THAT EVEN ONCE FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT OR CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION YEARS LATER. IT IS CERTAIN BY ANY OF THE COURT WILL GRANT IT CRIMINAL COURTS ARE HIGHLY LOCALIZED THE DECISION IS IN THE HANDS OF AN INDIVIDUAL JUDGE AND THE OPINION OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROSECUTOR IS OFTEN. INFLUENTIAL REQUEST FOR EXPUNGEMENT ARE OFTEN DENIED. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL TO WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ONE OF THE CCC FIRE CAN'T PROGRAMS AS AN INCARCERATED FIREFIGHTER. TO BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT UPON HIS OR HER RELEASE FROM CUSTODY. IT WOULD CREATE A PATHWAY FOR PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN HAVING THIS INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL WAIT YEARS BEFORE HERE SHE COULD TRY TO MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR CAREER. THIS TIENEN IS CRITICAL IT IS UPON A PERSON'S RELEASED FROM CUSTODY WHEN THEY MOST NEED A PATHWAY TO EMPLOYMENT. BY ALLOWING A PERSON WHO'S DEMONSTRATED IMPRESS REHABILITATION BY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING FIRE CAMP TO APPLY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT. THIS BILL WERE WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND PROVIDE A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AS WELL AS HIS OR HER FAMILY. WE'VE ALL HEARD THE STORIES OF REMINDERS OF WHY THERE IS A NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY IF NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. MEMBERS I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU- DO WE HAVE THE OTHER LEAD WITNESS THE YOU HAVE LIMITED TIME LEFT THE GO AHEAD. SELECT ONE AND I'M JUST GONNA BE REALLY QUICK I'M SPEAKING ON THE BEHALF OF ANTONIO WELLINGTON WHO IS A AMEND T. OF MINE ON THE TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD WIRE.

IT'S IN OUR WORK THAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED MANY UPON THE INCARCERATED YOU SUCH AS ANTONIO. WITH THEIR LIVES TO SERVING THE COMMUNITY BOTH WHILE INCARCERATED AND NOT. SINCE I'VE BEEN HOME.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ACTUALLY THIS WAS WARY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION- WE ARE REGRETTABLY OPPOSED TO A. B. TWO ONE FOUR SEVEN. WHILE WE LOG THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE THAT IT SIMPLY GOES TOO FAR THIS BILL WOULD GRANT PC TWELVE OH THREE POINT FOUR TYPE EXPUNGEMENT AND DISMISSAL TO PRISON SENTENCES THAT IS A DRAMATIC DEPARTURE LONG STANDING POLICY WHICH HISTORICALLY LIMITED SUCH RELIEF TO LOWER LEVEL PROBATION OR- PAROLE SENTENCES. EVEN WHEN AMENDMENTS TO HI MATES L. OPEN PROGRAM IT'S STILL APPLIES TO PERSONS CONVICTED OF MOST SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OR THESE SUCH AS ATTEMPTED MURDER ROBBERY AND FIREARMS OFFENSES. THE BILL STILL ALLOWS FOR INSTEAD EXPUNGED AND DISMISSAL UPON RELEASE FROM PRISON WITH NO SUPERVISION PERIOD WHATSOEVER NO CALL NO P. R. C. HAS NOTHING. THAT'S A HUGE GAMBLE THE AMENDED BILL SO THE DENIAL OF RELIEF IS WITHOUT PREJUDICE THAT MEANS THE DEFENDANT CONSERVE. RECORD. ALSO PAPER. WELL OF SCENARIO IS POTS IT'S NOT LIKE TERMS OF THE BILL A PERSON CONVICTED OF CHILD BE EXCERPTED CHRIS. MADE BY OF THE OF THIS BILL WORK IN A DAYCARE FACILITY. OR SOMEONE CONVICTED OF ELDER ABUSE SO ELDER FINANCIAL CRIMES AND SENT TO PRISON WILL UPON RELEASE THE WORKING IN IS IN AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY. FOSTER IS NOT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHICH WILL LEAVE A PERSON CONVICTED OF THESE CRIMES AND MANY OTHER SERIOUS FELONIES. FROM DISCLOSING THAT CONVICTION ON AN APPLICATION FOR A STATE OR LOCAL WHITES. INCLUDING SUCH BUSINESSES AS DAYCARE FACILITIES AND ASSISTED LIVING CENTERS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN HIDE THEIR CONVICTIONS EVEN FROM THOSE WHO OPERATE SENSITIVE USINESSES WITH VULNERABLE CLIENTELE. THERE ARE OTHER EXPUNGEMENT STATUTES ON THE BOOKS BUT STILL REQUIRE THE PERSON MUST DISCLOSE THE CONVICTION FOR LICENSING PURPOSES. THAT WILL NOT APPLY HOWEVER TO THOSE WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM AB TWO ONE FOUR SEVEN. CD SHARES A BELIEF WITH MANY OF THE COMMITTEE THE THERE ARE TOO MANY LICENSING RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONS CONVICTED OF FELONIES TO PREVENT THEM FROM EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY SIGNAL OUR WILLINGNESS TO BEGIN A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND ELIMINATE RESTRICTIONS THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE AND QUIRK OUR EFFORTS TO FULLY REINTEGRATE THOSE CONVICTED OF FELONIES BACK INTO OUR MAIN STREET. BUT SOME OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THE TWO LISTED ABOVE MAKE ABUNDANT GOOD SENSE. SURE BUSINESS OWNER HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE PERSON HERE SHE IS CONSIDERING HIRING AS A HOME HEALTH CARE WORKER WAS CONVICTED AND SENT TO PRISON. FOR ABUSING OR STEALING. L. BACK. STILL SAYS NO.

THE PROGRAM IS QUITE A STRICT. AND YOU CAN'T GET INTO THIS PROGRAM IF YOU HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF WHAT I WOULD CALL HEINOUS CRIMES.

I'D GO AHEAD CENTER RADFORD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE STONE THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT ANY INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON DEATH ROW ARE RE SENTENCED AND WILL PROTECT INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED PEOPLE FROM BEING SENTENCED TO DEATH IN THE FUTURE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THE SUPREME COURT DETERMINED THAT THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS THE EXECUTION OF INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE ENACTED A LAW TO CODIFY THAT DECISION THE FOLLOWING YEAR. OVER THE NEXT SEVENTEEN YEARS THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY MADE FAST ADVANCE VANCE'S. AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND DISABILITIES BUT THE LARGEST HAS NOT MODERNIZE THE LAW TO REFLECT THOSE ADVANCES. AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA USES UNFAIR AND OUTDATED STANDARDS TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE IS INELIGIBLE FOR EXECUTION. IT IS LIKELY THAT SOME OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY WAITING ON DEATH ROW HAVE INTELLECTUALLY. INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES ACCORDING TO CLINICAL STANDARDS THOSE INDIVIDUALS MUST BE RE SENTENCED AND REMOVED FROM DEATH ROW. AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE WILL UPDATE THE PENAL CODE AND REFLECT THE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE BY REQUIRING ON SET OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES TO HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD. CLARIFYING THAT IN POST CONVICTION PROCEEDINGS. EXPERTS ON INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES MUST TESTIFY TO OUT OF COURT STATEMENTS USED AND INFORMING THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWING A PERSON TO MAKE A SHOWING OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY BY USING THE KIND OF EVIDENCE THAT WOULD BE RELIED UPON BY A QUALIFIED EXPERT. ADDITIONALLY AB. TWELVE TWENTY FIVE TWELVE WILL PROHIBIT PROSECUTORS FROM ARE GOING TO POP UP. A PERSON'S IQ. BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE TO RENDER THEM ALL DOUBLE FOR EXECUTION. A. B. LIKE TAKING A COGNITIVE BRING TO US IN BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY ITEMS IN BE NOW CLASSIFIED AS A STABLE GENIUS. THIS IS A BLATANT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND WE CANNOT ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE IN A CALIFORNIA COURT ROOMS. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE DEATH PENALTY KILLS INNOCENT PEOPLE AND IS APPLIED UNEQUAL ALONG RACIAL AND SOCIO ECONOMICAL. ECONOMIC LINES WE ALSO KNOW THAT INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY PEOPLE FACE A HIGHER RISK ARE WRONGFUL EXECUTION. IN PASSING B TWELVE TWENTY FIVE TWELVE OUR STATE WILL ADOPT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY'S DEFINITION OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AND WILL PROHIBIT ARTIFICIAL INFLATION OF AYE CUES TO MAKE BLACK AND LEAD KNACKS PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR EXECUTION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD WE NOW HAVE TO LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES OF ONE WE HAVE ON THE LINE- NEW SHOULD SHOW AND WE'RE WAITING FOR A TASHA. MINSKER SO LET'S START WITH MICHELLE. GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS NATION'S JOHN I'M ACTUALLY THE ONLY SUBSTANTIVE WITNESS IN SUPPORT- I'M LEGAL DIRECTOR AT THE HABEAS CORPUS RESOURCE CENTER AND MISTER STONE STAFF ASKED ME TO ADDRESS HOW AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE. WILL BRING CALIFORNIA'S INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY STATUTE INTO COMPLIANCE WITH U. S. SUPREME COURT LAW. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE OUR LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THREE ADDING SECTION THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX OF THE PENAL CODE AND CODIFYING AT CONVENE VIRGINIA. DIDN'T SEND THE US SUPREME COURT HAS ISSUED SEVERAL OPINION OF CLARIFYING AND EXPANDING UPON THEIR HOLDEN ATKINS STRAPPING OVER AND OVER THAT STATES MUST. OKAY TO THE SIGN INTO ABILITY PEEL CODE SECTION THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND CONTRAST HAS BEEN UPDATED ONLY WANT TO CHANGE THE TERM MENTALLY RETARDED TO INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE BRINGS THE STATUTE IN LINE WITH THE U. S. SUPREME COURT OF FORTY AND CURRENT CLINICAL STANDARDS. EVERY AMENDMENT PROPOSED HERE IS ALIGNED WITH THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION YES SOME FIVE IN THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ON INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. FIRST AS A SCIENTIFIC MATTER THE DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD EXTENDS BEYOND THE EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY. IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THE DSM FIVE DROPPED A STRICT AGE CUT OFF FOR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY DEFINING IT AS A CONDITION THAT MUST MANIFEST. DURING THE DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD. THIS BILL DOES THE SAME. SECOND CLINICAL STANDARDS REQUIRE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO RELY ON A THOROUGH SOCIAL HISTORY RELEVANT RECORDS AND DOCUMENTS AND FORMAL INTERVIEWS IN ASSESSING INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE BRINGS CALIFORNIA LAW INTO ACCORD WITH U. S. SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT BY ALLOWING JUDGES TO HEAR AND CONSIDER ALL CLINICALLY RELEVANT EVIDENCE. THIRD BY CREATING AN ALTERNATE WAY TO MAKE A PRIMA FASHION SHOWING THIS BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA COURTS BETTER IDENTIFY THOSE FACING EXECUTION WHO MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED. THERE IS NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE STATE HERE THE DEFENDANT OR PETITIONER STILL HAS THE BURDEN OF PROOF AT A HEARING AND THE FACT FINDERS FINAL DECISION WILL ALWAYS BE BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THE PARTY TO PREVENT. FINALLY TO WORK IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TO KNOW THAT RACISM IN FACT IT. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE ATKINS IS THAT RACISM PLAGUE THOSE HEARINGS AS WELL. BEER IS IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE ARGUED IN ESSENCE THAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THEIR I. Q. SCORES ADJUSTED UPWARD. BECAUSE THE TESTS WERE MADE FOR THEM. BUT HAVE NO GROUNDING IN AND IS CONTRARY TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING A PERSON OF COLOR IQ SO THAT WE CAN EXECUTE THEM IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE STATE'S IDEALS AND TO THE CONSTITUTION. AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE WHEN THAT THE STATE IDENTIFIES AND PREVENTS THE EXECUTION OF INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED PEOPLE ADDS THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHOIRS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MICHELLE. WE ALSO. I NOW WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM WITNESSES IN THE ROOM. MACHINE NINE- ROOM TWENTY FORTY. SEEING NONE THEN WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE MODERATOR AND TAKE CUT CALLS FROM THOSE IN SUPPORT ONLINE.

THIS IS ANGELA BACKERS CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GOOD MORNING RANDALL ATTACKERS I AM JUST RECENTLY RETIRED- ALAMEDA COUNTY PROSECUTOR HANDLING CAPITAL CASES FOR TWENTY YEARS PROSECUTOR FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS AND THE CHAIR OF THE CAPITALIZATION COMMITTEE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THIS BILL IS. FLAWED IN MANY WAYS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I'LL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE FOR THIS COMMITTEE I'M ASKING FOR YOUR STERN YOURS OPPOSITION TO IT BECAUSE IT STRIPS CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR LOVED ONE. OF ALL OF THEIR RIGHTS WITH REGARD TO MURDER CASES AND OUT OF THIS- THIS LAW THE LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED IS GUARANTEED BY THE UNITED STATES A PRE COURT TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. UNDER THE CASE OF ATKINS BURST OF VIRGINIA AND IT DEFINES INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY IF WE DO NOT NEED A LOT OF. IN ADDITION TO NOT BEING CRIME VICTIMS. OF THEIR RIGHT TO THAT THIS CLAIM COULD BE ADDED WERE CRIME VICTIMS HAVE NO PRESIDENT NO SAY NO RIGHT. AT THE LAST MINUTE BY A HABEAS. PETITION WHEN THE CRIME VICTIMS AREN'T EVEN NOTIFIED AND PRESIDENT AND HAVE A RIGHT TO BE IN THE COURTROOM THIS COULD BE DONE- VIA HABEAS MANY YEARS LATER. IT ALSO CHANGES THE DEFINITION OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY TO MAKE IT VAGUE ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR THE DEFINITION OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE CHANGED. AGE IS VERY CLEAR THAT ALL QUALIFIED EXPERT PHD AND MEDICAL EXPERTS ALL AGREE THAT A PERSON WHO SUFFERS FROM AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY MANIFEST ITSELF WELL BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. THIS BILL IS VAGUE AND COMPLETION. BECAUSE IT IS WELL IT COULD DEVELOP ANYTIME BY ANY DOCTOR COME THAT. EIGHTEEN BUT JUST RECENTLY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT PROSECUTORS COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS STATED TO YOU A MOMENT AGO THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. THAT PROSECUTORS ARGUE TO CAPITAL JURY. THAT YOU MUST TO PUMP UP AN IQ SCORE OF A PERSON OF COLOR SO THAT THEY CAN NOT BE EXECUTED THAT IS A FALSE CLAIM. AND SO I AM URGING YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BECAUSE IT'S UNNECESSARY IT'S ALREADY GOVERNED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND- SANDWICHES YOUR TURN LEAD LINED THE WAY IT IS. YOU HAVE HIT YOUR AND IT MAKES IT BAG ARBITRARY COMPLETION THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHTS LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OPERATOR THERE'S NO ONE WHO'S COME INTO THIS ROOM SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S NINE TO CLEAN THIS. WILL YOU QUEUE UP ANY CALLERS IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY KEEP UP BY PRESSING ONE THEN ZERO ON THE TELEPHONE KEY PAD AGAIN THAT IS ONE THEN ZERO. YOU HAVE NO ONE IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME. CORRECT SO- LET'S SEE IF THERE IS- COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THE- DICE SENATOR MITCHELL. OKAY CENTER JACKSON YEAH ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LAST WITNESSES TESTIMONY THAT THIS BILL EXPANDS THE DEFINITION AND DOES MORE THAN CONF- CONFORMANCE TO THE FEDERAL LAW COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT EXPANDS IT JUST SAYS IT BRINGS IT UP THE CALIFORNIA HASN'T DONE ANYTHING AND SEVENTEEN YEARS SINCE THE RULING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. THERE IS AN IN LINE TO. OF THE CLINICAL ADVANCES IN. THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED SINCE THAT TIME IN AND BRINGS PENAL CODE IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE- ED. THANK YOU THE AT THE OTHER QUESTION ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT TAKING AWAY. THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS I'M NOT QUITE SURE UNDERSTOOD I AND THAT BUT THAT'S- WOULD BE OF CONCERN DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OF WESTEROS SPEAKS NOTHING TO THAT AND IT'S NO REASON WHY ONE WOULD. REMOVE A VICTIMS RIGHTS TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION OR ANYTHING ELSE TO. ONCE EXECUTION OR- SENTENCING SO THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT AT ALL SO. THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST THE STATE THAT THE ANALYSIS IN RESPONSE TO THAT THE ANALYSIS INDICATES CLEARLY THAT. ALL THE BILL DOES IS REVISED THE DEFINITION TO- THE- IT CONSISTENT WITH THE ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR IN FIVE. CURRENT CLINICAL STANDARDS SO THE REVISION DOES NOT BY THE NOW SIS- MEET THE- TYPE OF CHANGE THAT THE OPPOSITION REPRESENTATIVE DESCRIBED AND- SO YOU CAN LOOK AT PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS WORD DESCRIBES WHAT THE BILL DOES IN TERMS OF THE CHANGE IN DEFINITION. THANK YOU MADAM TRUCK MIGHT HAVE MISSED SOMETHING BAD A DESPONDENT RECOGNIZES THE CLINICAL STAND GO AHEAD SENATOR DIETARY RING WITH YOU JUST MIND AND MODERNIZES CLINICAL STANDARDS. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THREE THIRTEEN- NINE SENATOR- BRADFORD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I WANT TO THANK JOHN. BOB 20% THIS BILL I THINK IT'S ONE WHOSE TIME HAS COME AGAIN- HISTORY OF SHOWN THAT THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN EXECUTED IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN PEOPLE OF COLOR- MANY TIMES IT'S PROVEN INNOCENT AND ALSO MANY TIMES WITH INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGES THAT WOULD DEEM OTHER FOLKS AN ELIGIBLE FOR THE DEATH PENALTY. AND IT'S SOMEWHAT IRONIC THAT WE ARE GOING TO POP UP- BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS INTELLECTUAL CATHOLIC BACK TO PASSAGE WHEN IT COMES TO EXECUTING ON BUT NOT IN CONSIDERATION OF COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OR JOBS IN. IN THE COUNTRY SO. WITH THAT WE SHOULD LAST FOR. THANK YOU- LET'S SEE. THIRD. YES I NOISE ABOUT I'M JUST CHECKING TO SEE FAR MORE PARTICIPANT HAD ANY COMMENT BUT THE HAND IS NOT UP SO IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL. CENTER JACKSON MOVES THE BILL- ON IT IS IT WOULD BE DO PASSED TO THE FLOOR. THEN I WANTED TO THINK- BEFORE I TAKE. ASK FOR THE ROLL CALL IN WHEN IT THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND BY EXTENSION HIS PRESENTER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE DEFINITIONS THAT WE ARE USING IN THE PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES WE ARE USING TO FIT THE CURRENT. CLINICAL DEFINITIONS WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ADJUSTMENTS INTO OUR STATUTES AND CODES BASED ON. NEW MEDICAL. INFORMATION NEW RESEARCH NEW SCIENCE ON A VARIETY OF THINGS. AND I THINK THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT IN JUST MEANT CONSIDERING THAT IT IS. THE BRING IT IS A THE STATUTE THAT IS A DETERMINER ON WHETHER AS WE GET SOMEONE A DEATH SENTENCE OR NOT. SO I SUPPORT THE BILL AND- WE WILL NOW HAVE. BUT THE- CALL THE ROLL AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE MOTIONS TO PASS SKINNER BY IN OUR AYE MORE LOCK.

CORD THAT HE- IF THE WITH APPLICABLE ESTATE WE TO ANOTHER AND THIS COULD COME INTO A SECOND TYPE OF CASE WHEN OUR- CENTER ISSUE SPECIFICALLY TO BE MAY BE. INDIVIDUALS AWESOME TO WE THE STATE. TO RESTART LIVES GET A FOR SUCH GO AWAY FROM PERSON BUT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AND IS THE OF BEGIN THEIR LIVES IN NEW THE STATE. WE HAVE HAD QUE. THAT WOULD BE THAT WE DO COULD BE. WHERE INDIVIDUALS ALLOCATE START. ONE AROUND THE PERSON ANY STILL SEVERAL AWAY WE COULD POTENTIALLY. OUT BY. MISDEMEANORS YOU CAN DOWN BECAUSE THEY WERE UNAWARE I WILL NOT NOTIFY THE BILL APPLIES. THE SO HAPPY COULD YOU COME. DOCTORS ARE DO APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR THAT YEAH. YOU THE BILL. ALL RIGHT LET ASIDE HAVE ANY LINE IN OFF OPERATOR GO AHEAD. THE LIKE TO QUEUE UP IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AGAIN YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. I HAVE NO ONE IS LOOKING AT. AND RIGHT. LET'S IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. GO AHEAD SENATOR JEFF I JUST DON'T WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ALSO FOR- ACTUALLY INCORPORATING LANGUAGE THAT I HAD IN THE BILL OF. THAT HER WITHIN ASKED HIM TO ADD TO HIS MEASURE IN ORDER TO PULL DOWN IMPAIR DOWN THE OUR VILLAGE THIS HERE- YOU KNOW THESE ARE REALLY CRITICAL THESE- RESTRAINING ORDERS XIN ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIR FOR HAVING INTRODUCED THIS ISSUE BACK. IN FOURTEEN ARE AND I CHECKED THIS IS. SAVED MANY MANY LIVES- SO IT'S VERY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. I'M DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THAT THE CONSUMER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESEARCH CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE ARE STILL OPPOSED I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN. THE REQUESTED THE A. B. YOU HAVE TIGHTENED THE- I AM HAVING TROUBLE IMAGINING THOSE INSTANCES WHERE- THERE WOULD BE A SOMEONE CAUGHT IN THE OF. KIND OF THE MIDDLE AND NOT AWARE SO THAT THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES SUBJECT TO A CRIMINAL PENALTY I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT THE CA CJ HAS EXCELLENT LEGAL REPRESENTATION AND- THAT THESE FOLKS WOULD BE. ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE EXCESSIVELYSHOULD IT HAPPEN I HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE IMAGINING IT BUT- FOR THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN BUT I THINK THIS BILL IS A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE AND- TIGHTENS UP SOME OF THE RECALL TRANSACTION MORE THAN ANYTHING TO MAKE IT MORE. WHAT AND IN CAN'T TO THE TO THE VIOLENCE AND THAT UP. WE TO MAKE SURE THE DAY TO VERY AS WELL AND I THINK THE BILL DOES SAT SO. I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU HAVE MOTION SPEAK TO IT- SO THIS THIS WHOLE NOTION OF WHAT IS NOW CALLED EXTREME RISK. ORDER IN OTHER OR RED FLAG LAWS IN OTHER STATES WAS STARTED BY CALIFORNIA WE WERE THE FIRST TO PUT THROUGH WHAT WE CALL TO GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER AND DID SO AS SOON JACKSON POINT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AFTER THE REALLY AWFUL SHOOT THAT OCCURRED IN HER. IN HER DISTRICT WHEN. YOU SEE SOME OF OUR RAN ON ISLA VISTA AND THE- WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT I APPRECIATE THE ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE THE I APPRECIATE THEIR CONSISTENCY LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT EVERY BILL THAT WE ADDRESS BECAUSE AT FIRST. AND I THINK THAT THIS BàN A RESPECTIVE OF THE SENATE IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY WE ARE TRYING TO DO OUR BEST. TO ONLY CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF CRIME WHEN WE REALLY FEEL IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND WE HAVE WE HAVE REJECTED BILL WERE OME AUTHORS HAVE FELT THAT A NEW CATEGORY OF CRIME WAS REALLY NECESSARY AND WE LOVED IT OTHERS. YEAH BUT I THINK WE'VE REALLY. LET IN THE RIVER I AM SO TODAY EVEN THOUGH IT DOES DO WHAT THE CRIMINALS ARE ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE RAISED IS THAT I AM HAVE AS THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THIS LAW HAVE MONITORED OTHER STATES HAVE A DOT IN MOST OTHER STATES HAVE PATTERNED THEIR LAWS AFTER CALIFORNIA'S SO IN NOW ARE A LOT HAS BEEN MODIFIED OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. I'M AND- IT TO INCLUDE IT BOTH. ALSO ADDED SOME RESTRICTIONS AND MANY STATES HAVE PATTERN THAT AND SO I FEEL THAT. GIVEN THAT THE VERY PURPOSE OUR LAW IS ENHANCED OR IS IMPROVED IF ANYONE WHO COMES FROM ANOTHER STATE WHO IS UNDER SUCH A RESTRAINING ORDER THAT IT CONTINUES WITH THEM BECAUSE OUR WHOLE PURPOSE ALREADY KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY. OR OTHER GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LAWS WERE NO ABLE TO REALLY AFFECT STATE TO STATE SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'RE- YOU CAN GO ACROSS STATE LINES EVEN THOUGH TECHNICALLY AS A CALIFORNIAN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO OWN THESE. YES THE FIRE ARMS YOU CAN GO IN GET THEM IN OTHER STATES. THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT OUR STATE IS LESS SAFE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE REALLY EXCELLENT GUN VIOLENCE- PREVENTION OR LIMITATIONS LAWS WE BECOME LESS STAY SAFE BECAUSE OF PRACTICES OF OTHER STATES WHERE IS IN THIS CASE WE COULD BECOME MORE SAFE BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICE OF OTHER STATES. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT IS A GOOD MEASURE AND I APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL BROUGHT IT FORWARD AND THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER FOR PRESENTING IT. IN WITHOUT SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR JACKSON FOR THIS BILL AND IT IS TO PASS TO. BUT SEE IS THIS ONE TO. YES DO PASSED APPROACH.
