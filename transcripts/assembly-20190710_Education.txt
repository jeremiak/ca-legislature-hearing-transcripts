SMITH HERE WEBER [inaudible] WEBER HERE. WE DO HAVE A CORE CORE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY WE'RE GONNA GO WITH SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT FIRST I BELIEVE. A MAYBE YOU MAY PERCY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB. THREE TWENTY EIGHT TODAY ON SCHOOL START TIME. TEENAGERS IN OUR COUNTRY FRANKLY ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED. IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH SEPARATE EPIDEMIC AND ACCORDING TO CONCLUSIVE MEDICAL RESEARCH. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EPIDEMIC IS EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES THAT ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH THE BIOLOGICAL SLEEP NEEDS OF ADOLESCENT CHILDREN -- SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT WILL UPDATE THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE. WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH PARAMETERS FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL START TIMES. THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAYS BEGAN AT EIGHT THIRTY AM OR LATER FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. AND EIGHT AM OR LATER FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLS THAT IS A DIFFERENCE FROM LAST YEAR'S A BILL AND WE THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD AMENDMENT. FROM LAST YEAR AND MAKES THE BILL -- BETTER BECAUSE IT RESPECTS THE SCIENCE BUT GIVES LOCAL DISTRICTS FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN THEIR MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS AND THAT WAS A SUGGESTION THAT CAME UP AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS PRUDENT SO WE INCORPORATED INTO THE BILL -- THIS COMES FROM A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND MANY HELL OTHER HEALTH AND MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS. DESPITE DECADES OF OVERWHELMING AND COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE HARM TO TEENS FROM EARLY WAKE UP TIMES. THE VAST MAJORITIES OF CALIFORNIA SECONDARY SCHOOLS ABOUT 80% STILL BEGIN BEFORE EIGHT THIRTY AM. SO THAT THEY PREVENT MOST TEENS FROM GETTING. TO THE GETTING THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED -- SLEEP FOR GROWING BODIES AND BRAINS. ACCORDING TO THE CDC THE AVERAGE SECONDARY SCHOOL START TIME IN CALIFORNIA IS. EIGHT OH SEVEN AND MANY START FIRST PERIOD -- WELL BEFORE. SEVEN THIRTY EARLY SECONDARY SCHOOL START TIMES FRANKLY HARM CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY IN MANY WAYS. INSUFFICIENCY LEAP AMONG ADOLESCENTS CAUSES HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ACTIONS BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS OBESITY DIABETES. DROWSY DRIVING A CAR ACCIDENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SPORTS INJURIES. THESE EARLY SCHOOL HOURS ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE LET pTHESE EARLY SCHOOL HOURS ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO CAUSES OF DEATH AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE ACCIDENTS AND SUICIDE. I DON'T WANT TO READ. ABOUT ANYMORE TEENAGERS -- WHO HAVE TRIED FOR OF SUCCEEDED IN TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE I JUST DON'T WANT TO READ THAT ANYMORE? AND WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL HELP. STEM THOSE -- SUICIDE -- THOUGHTS AND OCCURRENCES. THE STATUS QUO ALSO CAUSES WORSE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SLEEP DEPRIVATION AMONG ADOLESCENTS STUDENTS. BECAUSE A SLEEPING IN CLASS DIFFICULTY PAYING ATTENTION FORGETFULNESS MORE ABSENCES MORE TARDY'S MORE DISCIPLINARY ACTION -- WORSE GRADES AND TEST SCORES AND HIGHER DROPOUT RATES. AND THE STATUS QUO IS ACTUALLY WIDENING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND HEALTH DISPARITIES IN OUR STATE BECAUSE EARLY STARTS ARE PROVEN TO HER DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN. THE MOST MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN ALREADY GET LESS SLEEP THAN THEIR MORE PRIVILEGE PEERS AND THEY FACE MORE OBSTACLES GETTING. TO EARLY BELLS ON TIME AND ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE HARM OF DEVELOPMENTALLY INAPPROPRIATE START TIMES. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT ACCORDING TO THE CDC LATER START TIME SEARCH THE SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION. WITH THE POTENTIAL TO HELP THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CHILDREN TO COMBAT THE ADOLESCENT SLEEP LOSS EPIDEMIC. THERE'S EXPANSIVE AS EVIDENCE SPANNING DECADES THAT WHEN SCHOOL STARTLING SKIT MORE SLEEP. THEY'RE HEALTHIER HAPPIER LESS LIKELY TO CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE LESS LIKELY TO GET IN THE CAR ACCIDENTS THERE TENANTS GOES UP THE GRADES GO UP. AND GRADUATION RATES GO UP AND IN CALIFORNIA INCREASED ATTENDANCE MEANS INCREASED AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE FUNDS TO SCHOOLS -- AND AS IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH THE RAND CORPORATION PROJECTS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WILL GROW BY ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER THE NEXT. DECADE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER GRADUATION RATES FEWER CAR ACCIDENTS WOULD LATER START AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS FROM OUR CURRENT EARLY START TIMES. AND EVERY YEAR THE EVIDENCE JUST KEEPS AMOUNTING. A RECENT STUDY OF THE SEATTLE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS A LARGE URBAN DISTRICT WHICH ADOPTED LATER START TIMES. CONFIRMED THE PREVIOUS FINDINGS WITH THE SHIFT A LATER START STUDENTS ARE GETTING MORE SLEEP GETTING BETTER GRADES AND ATTENDING SCHOOL MORE OFTEN. ATTENDANCE IMPROVE THE MOST THAT SCHOOLS WITH THE MOST LOW INCOME STUDENTS COMEY SAID AGAIN TENANTS IMPROVED AT THE SCHOOLS WITH THE MOST LOW INCOME STUDENTS. STUDENT ATHLETES ARE BIG BENEFICIARIES OF HEALTHY SCHOOL START TIMES AS WELL ACCORDING TO RESEARCH WELL RESTED STUDENT ATHLETES PERFORM BETTERIN THEIR SPORT. AND GET INJURED LESS OFTEN. WE KNOW THAT HEALTHY SCHOOL HOURS. WE KNOW THAT HEALTHY SCHOOL HOURS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF WELL RUN SCHOOL DISTRICTS A CUT ACROSS THE NATION THAT THRIVE WITH LATER AGE APPROPRIATE START TIMES. AT THEIR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS THEY HAVE HEALTHIER AND SAFER STUDENTS AND SUCCESSFUL SPORTS PROGRAM THE DATA AND EVIDENCE IS COMPELLING. EARLY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL START TIMES CLOSE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS TO OUR STATE YOU. AND FRANKLY I JUST THINK IT'S TIME DID YOU PUT THAT DATA AND THE RESEARCH AND THE RESULTS TO USE AND HELP THESE KIDS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FREQUENTLY SETS HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE ONE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE REVEALED THE DANGERS OF ASBESTOS LEAD PAINT SMOKING -- IMMUNIZATION -- THE LEGISLATURE ACTED TO PROTECT KIDS. SO TO THE LEGISLATURE CAN AND SHOULD ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S SIX MILLION PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN. FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK SO. OBVIOUSLY WHEN APPROPRIATE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DR RAFAEL PALLADIO FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. I HAVE JOY WAKE FROM START SCHOOL LATER AND I HAVE DR ANOOP CURRY POT A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST WITH SCRIPTS HEALTH AND PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SLEEP SOCIETY. TO MAKE OUR CASE SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THEM TO HAVE THE TIME TO MAKE THEIR CASE. I YOUR FIRST WITNESS I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SIX MINUTES SO I YOU MAY HAVE CUT IT UP ANY ANYWHERE YOU DESIRE SO THERE YOU'RE. NOT USED AT ALL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I'M A PROFESSOR AND PHYSICIAN I STANFORD UNIVERSITY. TOO MANY HOUSEHOLDS BEGIN THE DAY WITH A STRUGGLE TO GET THEIR TEENS OUT OF BED. AND IT ENDED A WITHIN ARGUED ABOUT GOING TO SLEEP. SB THREE TWENTY ACRES PARENTS AND STUDENTS MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR HEALTH. THE EVIDENCEIS CLEAR AND OVERWHELMING THERE ARE LESSONS ARE SUFFERING FROM HARMFUL CHRONIC SLEEP DEPRIVATION. EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES ARE PROVING TO BE MODIFIABLE CONTRIBUTOR TO THEIR SLEEP DEPRIVATION. SCIENCE TEACHES US THAT OUR LESSONS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO SLEEP DEPRIVATION BECAUSE THERE'S A BIOLOGICAL SHIFT IN THEIR BRAINS RHYTHMS. MOST TEENS CAN'T JUST GO TO SLEEP EARLIER. THE AMERICAN CARRY PEDIATRICS HAS DETERMINED THAT EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES PREVENTS MOST TEENS FROM GETTING HEALTHY SLEEP THEY NEED. A SCIENTIFIC REVIEW OF NEARLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND TEENAGERS HAS FOUND THAT TO SLEEP DURATION IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR. FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SUICIDALITY. THE LOWEST RISK IS FOR STEVE DURATIONS OF EIGHT TO NINE HOURS. MOST TEENAGERS ARE LUCKY TO EVEN GET SEVEN HOURS ON SCHOOL NIGHTS. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATIONS OF PUSH SCHOOLS TO START TOO EARLY. THIS HAS LED TO PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING INCREASED CAR ACCIDENTS. ALL OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW TEENAGERS ON ANTI DEPRESSANTS SLEEPER RESTORED TO BRING IN HEELS THE MIND. THESE KIDS BRAINS ARE STILL DEVELOPING. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT RESEARCH HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT DELAYING TO SCHOOL START TIME IS IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF TEENAGERS. THE BIOLOGY OF THE STEEP CANNOT CONTINUE BE TREATED AS AN INCONVENIENCE. THIS STATE IS NOT BEING ASKED A SET SCHEDULE FOR INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS. THE STATE ASSEMBLY BEING ASKED TO ESTABLISH A FLOOR AND HOW EARLY SCHOOLS CAN FORCE TEENAGERS TO BE IN CLASS. LET THERE BE NO DOUBT THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE IS SO COMPELLING THE PROFESSIONAL HELP SOCIETIES ARE CALLING FOR ACTION. THE AMERICAN OKAY PEDIATRICS STANFORD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF SLEEP MEDICINE THE NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION CALIFORNIA ZIP SOCIETY AMONG SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT. AGREED AT THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THERE ARE ZERO HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSING THIS BILL. NOT A SINGLE. ONE NOW YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSLATE THE SCIENCES THE SOUND PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY AND SEND THE MESSAGE THAT WE VALUE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN OF ALL OF THE CONCERNS. PLEASE GIVE THESE GUYS A BREAK AND LET THEM SLEEP THANK YOU. THANK YOU EVEN FOR KIDS WITH GOOD SLEEP HABITS EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES MANDATE THAT MOST TEENS WAKE UP AT TIMES THAT DOCTORS SAY INCREASE THE RISK FOR MANY ILLNESSES SUICIDE AND ACCIDENTS. I'M SURE WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO THINK THAT CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. BUT IN THIS CASE AT SOME DISTRICTS IT ISN'T PRIORITIZED. THOSE IN THE SYSTEM WITH A STAKE IN THE STATUS QUO HAVE TOLD YOU ALL OF THE MANY ADMINISTRATIVE OBJECTIVES THAT THEY VALUE MORE THAN THE HEALTHY SCHOOL START TIMES FOR TEENS. THAT'S WHY OUR CHILDREN NEED SB. THREE TWENTY EIGHT CURRENTLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN DISREGARD THIS HEALTH AND MEDICAL POLICY GUIDELINES AND CONTINUE TO HARM THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF TEENS WITH DEVELOPMENTALLY INAPPROPRIATE SCHOOL HOURS. THE STATE WIDE POLICY IS THE REMEDY. AND IT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE ADOLESCENT SLEEP DEPRIVATION IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC WHOSE PRIMARY MODIFIABLE BECAUSE IS THIS PUBLIC EDUCATION POLICY. BECAUSE PUBERTY BECAUSE AFTER YOU READY KIDS NATURALLY STAY AWAKE LATER. EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES DEPRIVE MOST TEENS OF THE STATE THAT THEY'RE GOING BODIES AND BRAINS NEED. OUR CHILDREN SLEEP HEALTH HAS FALLEN THROUGH A RESPONSIBILITY GAP. DEFAULTING THIS IMPORTANT STATEWIDE PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL BOARDS HAS PROVEN DETRIMENTAL TO CHILDREN. AFFECTING CHANGE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAS PROVEN VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE ALL OF THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT EXIST THERE. FOR EXAMPLE MANY SCHOOL BOARDS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE FINAL SAY ON WHAT TIMES ARE SCHOOL START BECAUSE OF CONTRACT LANGUAGE WITH BARGAINING GROUPS WE SUPPORT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT NOT FOR OUR KIDS HEALTH IS JUST TOO IMPORTANT. AND ALTHOUGH ELLIE GAYS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR A LOT THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR INCREASING TEEN SLEEP OR DECREASING DROWSY DRIVING ACCIDENTS ETCETERA. SO THE MANY EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES OVER WHICH SCHOOL BOARDS ARE ACCOUNTABLE GET PRIORITIZED. BUT THE LEGISLATURE ON THE OTHER HAND ALL OF YOU CLEARLY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT OUR STATE'S CHILDREN FROM KNOWN PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS THE AD CODE IS FILLED WITH SUCH PROTECTIONS. AND BESIDES GIRLS ARE HARM TO MORE THAN BOYS FROM THE STATUS QUO. GIRLS ARE HARMED MORE BECAUSE THEY GO THEY GO THROUGH PUBERTY CERNER AND AFRICAN AMERICAN GIRLS ARE SPECIALLY HARM BECAUSE THEY GO PURITY GO THROUGH PUBERTY CENTER THAN WHITE GIRLS. WE BELIEVE EVERY CHILD DESERVES EQUAL PROTECTION FROM KNOWN PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS AND NO CHILD SHOULD HAVE THEIR HEALTH DETERMINED BY THEIR ZIP CODE INCOME LEVEL OUR RACE. WE TRULY UNDERSTAND THAT HEALTHY SCHOOL START TIMES WILL TAKE SOME EFFORT AND IN SOME CASES RESOURCES. BUT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF SIX MILLION CALIFORNIA CHILDREN ARE WORTH THE EFFORT. MANY DISTRICTS NATIONWIDE HAD ALREADY PROVEN THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO HARM TEENS HEALTH AND SAFETY TO EFFICIENTLY ADMINISTER SCHOOL DISTRICT A TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT OR HAVE A THRIVING EXTRACURRICULAR PROGRAM. AS ADULTS IT IS OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO PROTECT CHILDREN. AND AS ADULT LEADERS YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR THANK YOU.

BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO COPE WITH THE PRESSURES THEY OFTEN GET BIG PLEASE SOMEONE OF SLEEP THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN THIS FILM ARE DECREASED AND WANT OF SLEEP THAT THEY GET. THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL KIDS HAVE TREMENDOUS STRESS ON TOP OF IT HAVING BECAUSE SOMEONE ASLEEP OFTEN MAKES THEM. WONDERFUL TO HAVE MOMENTOUS DISHES.

THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. JUST COME FORWARD AND YOU MAY SIT AT THE TABLE HERE. NUMBER TWO I THOUGHT THEY WERE. TOO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN YEAH -- MORE THE MERRIER. AND THEN BAD. PROBLEMATIC OKAY. CAN I BECAUSE I THINK. REFER ME TO ME YEAH. YEAH BE READY. YES PROCEED WITH X. MINUTES TOTAL MY NAME IS IAN CAMPBELL PHD -- APPROACHING LOUDER. MY NAME IS IAN CAMPBELL PHD I'M A PROJECT SCIENTISTS AT THE UC DAVIS SLEEP LAB. AND THAT ONE IT SAY THE THE VIEWS THAT I'M EXPRESSING TODAY OR FROM MY MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS IN RESEARCH AND SLEEP ON AND MORE THAN THAT OR NINETEEN OR SO ON ADOLESCENT SLEEP AS A SIGN TO THE UC DAVIS AND THEY ARE MY OWN. AND NOT NECESSARILY THOSE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA HOPE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO READ THE LETTER THAT IRWIN FIND BURKE AND I WROTE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ARE BRIEFLY REVIEW OUR REASONS FOR OPPOSING IT. MANY ADOLESCENTS TO DO HAVE A CIRCADIAN PHASE DELAY THAT CAUSES THEM TO PREFER A LATER BEDTIME HOWEVER SLEEP SCIENTISTS DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS PHASE DELAY. RATHER THAN THAT THE DELAY RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT RGULATE CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS THE BEST EVIDENCE IS THE ADOLESCENT SLEEP NEED ACCUMULATES MORE SLOWLY ACROSS THE DAY AND THIS ALLOWS THEM TO STAY UP LATER. A RECENT MODELING STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT RATHER THAN ACCOMMODATING THE PHASE DELAY BY ALTERING SCHOOL START TIME A MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH IS TO REDUCE EVENING LIGHT EXPOSURE. FURTHERMORE SLEEP RESEARCHERS DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW SLEEP NEED CHANGES DURING ADOLESCENCE OUR LAB IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING AN NIH FUNDED STUDY TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION. SECOND PROPONENTS FAILED TO IN A KNOWLEDGE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THE INITIAL SLEEP IN THE INITIAL INCREASE IN SLEEP DURATION FOLLOWING SCHOOL START TIMES MAY NOT PERSIST. IT IS REASONABLE TO ASK IF WE DELAY START TIMES WANT TEENS JUST STAY UP LATER. A LONGITUDINAL STUDY FOUND JUST THAT DELAYING PARTS HIGH SCHOOL START TIME FROM SEVEN FORTY FIVE EIGHT THIRTY AM. PRODUCED AN INITIAL TWENTY MINUTE INCREASE IN SCHOOL AND SLEEP DURATION DUE TO A TWENTY MINUTE LATER RISE TIME. HOWEVER SIX MONTHS LATER BEDTIMES WERE ALSO DELAYED TWENTY MINUTES RESULTING IN NO CHANGE IN SLEEP DURATION. THIRD A NATIONWIDE STUDY ORIGINALLY CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY SHOWED THAT EIGHT THIRTY MAY NOT BE THE APPROPRIATE LIMIT AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ALL ALL SITUATIONS. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN START TIME AND SLEEP DURATION. WAS STRONGEST PRIOR TO EIGHT AM AFTER EIGHT AM THERE WAS NO RELATION BETWEEN STILL START TIME AND SLEEP DURATION. THE AUTHORS RECOMMENDED MORE RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL START TIME CHANGES WE AGREE. INSTEAD OF COMPELLING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADOPT THE STATE MANDATED START TIME WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PERHAPS ASSISTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE MANY SLEEP SCIENTISTS IN THE STATE. PROVIDE GUIDELINES SO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO DELAY START TIMES CAN COLLECT APPROPRIATE DATA TO EVALUATE THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE CHANGE. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CINDY GARDNER SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT FOR ROOM OF THE WORLD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SAMBAR NAY DINO ENCOMPASSING SCHOOL BOUNDARIES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE SQUARE MILES. IN THE ELEVATION FROM FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED FEET TO SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED FEET. 71% OF OUR STUDENTS RELY ON HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION DUE TO OUR WORKING FAMILIES OUR UNIQUE GEOGRAPHICAL CHALLENGES IN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS OF OUR DISTRICT. TO IMPLEMENT A LATER START TIME FOR HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CURRENT STAGGERED START TIME SCHEDULE WE HAVE. ROOM WOULD NEED TO DOUBLE ITS FLEET OF BUSES AND STAFF FOR ONE TIME COSTS A THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AN ONGOING COSTS OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. WEARING DECLINING ENROLLMENTS SO IN ORDER TO AVOID INSOLVENCY THIS WOULD EQUATE TO THE LAYOFF OF TWELVE TEACHERS INCLUDING THE ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL'S CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT. LAY OFF AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL FOR COUNSELORS FIVE LIBRARIANS AND THREE SECRETARIES THERE WOULD BE A REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF ARE MOST. HELPFUL PROGRAMS SUCH AS OUR VIRTUAL AND CREDIT RECOVERY PROGRAMS THAT HELP THE MOST AT RISK STUDENTS GRADUATE. THE ELIMINATION OF DRAMA BAND FIELD TRIPS CHOIR AND MY FAVORITE ATHLETICS WE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO LIMóN EIGHT THE TEXTBOOK ADOPTION FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. BECAUSE WE CANNOT TRUNCATE OUR BUS TURN AROUND TIMES CREATING OTHER STAGGERED START TIME OPTIONS ALL HAD NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. STARTING ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AT SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT AM HIGH SCHOOL AT EIGHT THIRTY AM IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AT TEN FIFTEEN AM WOULD MAKE THE FIRST PICK UP AT THE MOST REMOTE BUS STOPS. AT SIX TWENTY TWO AM FOR THE ELEMENTARY STUDENTS SO ARE REALLY YOUNG TKA FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE GOING TO BE STANDING AT BUS STOPS DURING THE WINTER IN THE DARK IN THIS NOW. THE LAST MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT BUS DROP WOULD BE FIVE FORTY ONE PM. AND MAY PRECLUDE PARTICIPATION IN AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES LIKE KARATE DANCE LESSONS C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> USE SPORTS. MY DISTRICT HAS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY NINE POINT 5% OF OUR STUDENTS RECEIVING FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS SO WHY THOUGH GEOGRAPHY OF MY DISTRICT IS UNIQUE OUR STUDENT POPULATION LOOKS A LOT LIKE THOSE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET OUR SINGLE PARENTS AND OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS THEY JUST CAN'T GET THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL THAT LATE? THEY JUST CAN'T SO WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS FOR THESE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. AND OTHERS LIKE IT I WANT YOU TO VOTE NO ONE SB. TWENTY NINE THREE TWENTY EIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GLAD THAT WOULD WORK ON THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS AT THE ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA TRANSIT DISTRICT. I'M HERE TO TODAY TO EXPRESS THE DISTRICTS OPPOSITION TO SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACT ON AC TRANSIT OPERATING BUDGET. AND PREVENT THE DISTRICT FROM PROVIDING THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SUPPLEMENTAL SCHOOL SERVICE THAT WE DO TODAY. EASY TRANSIT PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE THOUSAND TRIPS A DAY INCLUDING ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DAILY STUDENT TRIPS. AT TRANSIT COORDINATES WITH EACH SCHOOL TO STAGGER START TIMES TO ALLOW MULTIPLE SCHOOLS TO BE SERVED BY A SINGLE BUS AN OPERATOR. THIS COURT NATION ENABLES US TO PROVIDE THE MOST EFFICIENT LEVEL OF SERVICEAND ALLOWS THESE BUSES TO TRANSITION TO COMMUTER SERVICE AFTER THE SCHOOL SERVICES COMPLETE. IF THE SCHOOL START TIMES CHANGE THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR MORNING SERVICE BECAUSE A LATER START TIME WILL CONFLICT WITH THE MORNING COMMUTE. AC TRANSIT SCHEDULES FORTY SIX BUSES EACH MORNING COULD TO ACCOMMODATE SCHOOL SERVICE IF SB THREE TWENTY IS ENACTED THE LOSS OF STAGGERED START TIMES AND THE INCREASED DEMAND WILL REQUIRE AC TRANSIT. TO SCHEDULE A TOTAL OF SEVENTY THREE BUSES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL LET'S SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE THIS REPRESENTS A 60% INCREASE IN OPERATING COSTS FOR US. WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE COST IMPACT OF HOW STUDENTS GET TO AND FROM SCHOOL AND HOME AC TRANSIT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE. THEREFORE ON BEHALF OF AC TRANSIT I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY PLEASE.

THE COLD WAR -- FOURTH FIFTH GRADE TEACHER HERE IN SACRAMENTO SEXY UNIFIED. TWENTY YEARS -- I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS PLEASE. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK BEHIND THE DíAS -- ALL KIND OF START OFF HERE WITH SOME OF MY THOUGHTS -- IN MY MIND A PRACTICAL I'M I'M A PARENT OF TWO TEENAGERS. BUT A TEACHER FOR A LOT OF YEARS. AND YOU KNOW. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD OF THE NANNY STATE I'M FEARFUL THAT THIS IS THE STAVING THE NANNY. RIGHT -- IN A AND I THINK THIS MIGHT BE GOOD POLICY. AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL BUT MY CONCERN IS A SETTING THAT I MEAN. YES SETTING. THE THE SCHOOL BELL FROM SACRAMENTO AYE I JUST DON'T THINK WE KNOW EACH DISTRICTS. NEW ONCE IS ENOUGH TO SAY WELL WE KNOW BEST AND THIS IS WHAT IT SHOULD BE. ACROSS OUR STATE BUT AGAIN I'M NOT OPPOSED TO TO STARTING SCHOOL LATER AT ALL. NOT AT ALL BUT I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S GOOD LOCAL POLICY. BUT NOT NECESSARILY GOOD STATE POLICY TO DESIGNATE THE START TIME FOR EACH SCHOOL DAY COMMISSION WE SHOULD BE SENATE AND TIME AND TIME TO GET TO KNOW A LOT OF QUESTIONS YOU RESET THE SCHOOL KELLER. I WISH SCHOOL STARTED AFTER LABOR DAY HOW MANY OF YOU WISH THAT WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SPONSOR A LAW. TO DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS THE PURVIEW OF A LOCALLY THAT'S RIGHT NEXT YEAR ELECTED ELECTED WHERE. EXACTLY -- RELEASE BOILS DOWN TO ME -- IT TOGETHER TAKE TO ME THIS WAS ON A SURFBOARD A COW AND A TRAIN. OKAY A SURF BOARD WISE I'VE SHARED BEFORE MY DAUGHTERS IN THE SURF TEAM AT OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL. IN TWO DAYS A WEEK HER FIRST PERIOD IS ACTUALLY AT SIX FORTY FIVE IN THE MORNING RIGHT SHE OPTS INTO THIS. AND SHE IS TO BE DOWN IN THE WATER. RIGHT AND SO FIRST HEARD HER FIRST PERIOD IS ACTUALLY SIX FORTY FIVE IN THE MORNING COUPLE DAYS A WEEK. AND SO SHE DOESN'T GO TO FIRST PERIOD AT SCHOOL AND AND THIS WOULD. YOU KNOW KILL THAT PROGRAM THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN BEFORE SCHOOL THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S AWARE OF AND AGAIN SHE OPTS INTO THIS PROGRAM IS NOT MANDATORY THAT SHE'S ON THE SURF TEAM. BUT I AM VERY PLEASED THAT SHE IS I THINK IT BROUGHT SCHOOL SPIRIT BILL SCHOOL COMMUNITY WHEN KIDS ARE ENGAGE IN SPORTS BEFORE OR AFTER SCHOOL -- SOME SCHOOLS HAVE AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS OR CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT THEY DO UNIQUE THING THINGS THE MORNING I'M A CITY BOY. BUT FROM WHAT I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW COUNT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON. RIGHT YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS AND THIS AGAIN WOULD. POTENTIALLY HARM SOME OF OUR AG PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE -- IN A TRAIN THERE'S A SCHOOL IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT THEY HAVE TO SET. THE SCHOOL DAY ACCORDING TO WHEN A TRAIN GOES BY BECAUSE SO MANY CARS GET BACKED UP BY THIS TRAIN. SO AGAIN THERE'S JUST SO MANY NUANCES ACROSS OUR STATE AND HOUSE WAS OPERATING WHY THEY OPERATE ON THE TIME TABLE THEY DO THAT I DON'T THINK. IT'S GOOD TO TO TO TO GET SET THAT THAT THAT START TIME FROM SACRAMENTO I'M A MOMENT A LOCAL CONTROL GUY I THINK A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD HAS THE EXPERTISE TO DO THIS. WE'RE STATE THAT'S DIVERSE IN PEOPLE YES BUT ALSO GEOGRAPHY AND THAT MEANS A LOT OF THINGS -- I MEAN WHY HAVE A SCHOOL BOARD AGAIN IT'S A QUESTION I ASK WORKING FAMILIES. RIGHT THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT THEM. AND I COME FROM A DISTRICT WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF WORKING FAMILIES AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO FALL ON OKAY. TYPICALLY IS GONNA FALL ON THE WOMAN. OKAY MY WIFE AT HOME WITH THE KIDS RIGHT NOW I'M UP HERE RIGHT SHE SAYS HAVING A GOOD TIME. RIGHT BUT IT THIS BURDEN IS GOING TO FALL ON WORKING WOMEN. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MORE HEAVILY THAN OTHERS. I WAS GONNA COST CHILDCARE ISSUES. PEOPLE HAVE TO GO TO WORK I DON'T THINK. BUSINESS IS GONNA NOT OPEN BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DAY OR THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR START TIME BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DAY. START TIME AT HAS STARTED -- IT'S GONNA COST MORE MONEY AS IT'S BEEN OUTLINED FOR BUSES BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY A CERTAIN WONDER YOU GOT TO GET KIDS TO SCHOOL RIGHT. YOU DON'T WANT THEM GOING TO SCHOOL AT TEN THIRTY BECAUSE I JUST GONNA DRIVE IN LATER INTO THE AFTERNOON WITH THE EARLY EVENING HOURS WILL BE AT SCHOOL SLEEP I THINK THE THE DOCTOR'S POINTED OUT THAT. THEN WHEN I HEARD AND SAY THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YEAH KIDS MIGHT HAVE SLEPT TWENTY MINUTES MORE THAN. ALL OF SUDDEN THEY THEY WENT ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES LATER RIGHT SO I I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS NECESSARILY GOING. TO LEAD TO MORE -- SLEEP BACK TO THE BUSING ISSUE WE WE HAVE KIDS OUT THERE ON A BUS IN THE DARK. RIGHT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY WORK IN FACT WE HAVE SOME REAL COMMITTEES I THINK STILL HAVE A FORTY SCHOOL TO AWAIT. RIGHT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN WINDOW TO TO TRANSPORT KIDS IN THOSE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES A KID SITTING OUT THAT. A CHILD SITTING OUT IN THE SNOW IN THE DARK I DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT THAT'S A HEALTHY SITUATION THE BLOCK SCHEDULE THAT HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP. BUT I KNOW WITH MY DAUGHTER I THINK SHE'S TO BE A SCHOOL LIKE SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY FIVE A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK AND EVERY DAY SHE GOES AT NINE THIRTY SO THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE BLOCK SCHEDULE THAT THE BLOCK SCHEDULE OFFICE OFFERS KIDS. STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS INTO AN ADVANTAGE IN THE ALSO KIDS WHO CREDIT RECOVERY MAKE UP THE BOX IT WAS GREAT FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE X. RECURRENCE. SO MY FEARS OF THIS WAS THIS WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT. THE THE BLOCK SCHEDULE I HAVE ANOTHER CONCERN. OR OR THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GONNA WRITE A BILL THAT HAS PARENTS PUT THEIR KIDS TO BED. NINE AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE THE STE. IN THE SCHOOL STARTS WRITING IS REALLY KIND OF AN ISSUE THE BOILS DOWN. TO OUR PARENTS. YOU KNOW INTERACT WITH OUR CHILDREN SO SO SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S COME UP AND IT'S AN UNKNOWN. AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN ANSWER. TO IT RIGHT NOW. WOULD IT HAS TO DO WITH EIGHTY A MINUTES YOU'VE GOT IT SAYS -- WITH AN UNKNOWN HERE'S THE BILL -- AUTHORIZES JUSTER STRONGER CLASSES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE'S BEFORE. BEFORE THE START OF THE SCHOOL DAY -- THAT DO NOT GENERATE ADA SO THE THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES THAT INTERACTS. WITH THE SCHOOLS ABILITY TO GENERATE EIGHTY EIGHT WILL THEY HAVE ENOUGH MINUTES AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO GENERATE ADEQUATE ADA SO MAY. HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AT AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT THAT'S GOOD I CAME UP TODAY AND IT'S GONNA TAKE. I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR INTENT I'M SURE OF THAT WITH THAT THAT IS A QUESTION AND AGAIN I WHERE I COME FROM IS. AGAIN GOOD POLICY POR LAW. THAT'S JUST SIMPLY WORST AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANY COMMENTS. MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISS SHERRIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTS WHICH CAN IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AND OUR HEARTFELT MEANINGFUL A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. ONE I UNDERSTAND THIS AS EXAM TO RULE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WHICH WHICH I KNOW HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. THAT -- SOME OF THE URBAN DISTRICTS MAY NOT. BE ENGAGED AND AND THEN TO THIS LAST POINT OF OR THE WHO OPENED THE CHAIR TALKING ABOUT. YOU HAVING A SERVING CLASSIC EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF I THINK IT'S ITEM FOR THAT SIMPLY SOME THE ANALYSIS AND AND LOOKING YOUR BILL THERE IS A AN EGG AN EXEMPTION OR AT LEAST -- THAT TO ALLOW FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE IS TO BE GAUGES CERTAIN ACTIVITIES SO -- THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING I DON'T KNOW THAT REQUIRES MORE CLARIFICATION AS THIS MOVES FORWARD TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT -- THE CHAIR THE CHAIR O'DONNELL IS REFERRING TO WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED FOR YEAH IF I COULD RESPOND. ZERO APPEARS EXAM I MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT -- IT WAS SOMETHING THAT -- THE PTA WAS ADAMANT -- IN EXPRESSING BEFORE THEY CAME ON BOARD I AGREE WITH THAT. THOSE OPTIONAL OPT IN. PROGRAM THEIR EXAMS YOU KNOW -- THAT'S THAT'S JUST WHAT THE LAW DOES YOU KNOW IF IT NEEDS MORE CLARITY WILL BRING MORE BUT WE THINK THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR -- AND I'M HAPPY TO TO TRY TO TIGHTEN THE LANGUAGE BUT YOUR CORRECT ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE ZERO PERIOD IS EXEMPT -- AN INTERESTING BY PRODUCT WHAT SOME SCHOOLS ACTUALLY SEE -- IS THAT ATTENDANCE AT ZERO PERIOD -- TO POSIT A BY PRODUCT THAT MORE KIDS WILL OPT INTO THE ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS. AS ZERO PERIOD MOVES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A CURRENT SCHOOL THAT STARTS AT SEVEN THIRTY YOUR APPEARANCE AT SIX THIRTY A LOT OF KIDS WON'T. OPT INTO A SIX THIRTIES YOU'RE PRETTY PARTICULAR WE SEEN BOYS MUSIC PROGRAMS WHEN THAT SCHOOL MOVES TO EIGHT THIRTY AND ZERO APPEARED GOES. TO SEVEN THIRTY WE SEEN THE NUMBER OF BOYS IN THOSE ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS OFTEN AGAIN THAT'S VOLUNTARY. BUT THAT'S A POSITIVE BY PRODUCT OF THAT BUT YOUR PEERS ARE EXEMPT. AND COMES UP EVERY TIME WE BRING IT UP IN THE ANSWERS BUT YEAH SO THAT JUSTICE ONE THAT CLARIFICATION AND I KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STUDIES AND AND THEY'RE STILL -- MAYBE SOME LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS THAT THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED -- DELAYED SCHOOL START -- EITHER IN THIS STATE OR ANOTHER STATE SENATE ACTUALLY DONE STUDIES ON IT AND SO -- IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD IF IT EVER GOT ENACTED INTO LAW I THINK THAT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO GET SOME OF THE REPORT BACKS THE STUDIES AS THE REAL IMPACTS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S TWO THERE'S TWO VERY LEGITIMATE -- OPPOSING OPINIONS -- BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE THE THE THE THE SCIENCE AND AND I KNOW ONE OF THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THOUGH THE ONE IS REFERRED TO IN THE REPORT IN THE ANALYSIS -- ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED BY THE STAFF BY THE WAY -- THAT IN SEATTLE THE LITTER SCHOOL TIMES. LED -- TO INCREASING PUNCTUALITY AND TEN IS A PERFECTLY AMOUNTS ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. SCHOOLS I'M SO I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF X. FACTORS I THINK THAT MOVING IT. YOUR DOCTOR GONNA HAVE SOME PARENTS GONNA BECAUSE OF AN ISSUE WITH SOME PARENTS MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER -- FOR BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT. ONCE YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO A CERTAIN SCHEDULE THAT YOURS YOUR SCHEDULE GETS ADJUSTED SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IT IT WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE. SOME EFFORT OF FOR EVERYONE TO TO HAVE TO READJUST AND I KNOW THAT. COSTS -- PARTICULARLY BECOMES TRANSPORTATION IS SUCH ARE SOMETHING THAT -- WE ALL HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- SURE -- I WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW THE DECISION TO COME TO US -- AT SOME POINT IF THERE'S A IF THERE IS A REAL ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO COST AND TRANSPORTATION WITH SOME OF THE DISTANCE I DO HAVE. A MORE EXTENSIVE BUSING AND IN PARTICULAR -- BUT BUT I I THINK THAT -- THE BUT WITH ME IS A SIGN IS THE SCIENCE AND AS THE CHAIR INDICATED GOOD POLICY -- GOOD POLICY ISN'T ALWAYS EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE EASY TO IMPLEMENT. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T PURSUE IT -- AND SO WITH THAT I'M I MAKE THEM OUT OF MY COMMISSION WITH THE BILL ANYBODY ELSE. SOME REMEMBER SPENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR MOST SINCERELY FOR HIS DILIGENCE IN THIS EFFORT I WAS FOLLOWING THIS BEFORE I WAS A MEMBER OF THIS BODY. AND I KNOW THAT HE APPROACHES THIS BECAUSE OF HIS COMMITMENT TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. AND REGRETTABLY I CAN'T BE THERE WITH YOU TODAY WITH AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE I AM GOING TO ABSTAIN -- BUT I WILL SAY THIS% TO OUR COALITION OF EDUCATION FOLKS IN THE ROOM. THE EVIDENCE IS STARTING TO BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPELLING. AND WE ARE OBLIGATED AS A STATE WITH A SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS TO START LOOKING AT HOW WE STOP THIS WITH OUR YOUTH. AND I CANNOT CONTINUE TO TALK TO DISTRICT AFTER DISTRICT TO SAYS WE NEED MORE COUNSELLING SUPPORT WE NEED A PSYCHOLOGIST ON STAFF ABSOLUTELY OF COURSE YOU DO. BUT IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO LIKE THIS THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE LOGISTICS OF THAT WE CAN FUND OF THE LOGISTICS OF TO HELP GIVE OUR STUDENTS ONE MORE MEASURE OF SUCCESS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE THAT BALANCE IN MENTAL HEALTH WE OUGHT TO DO IT AND SO MY COMMITMENT IS TO THIS AUTHORS IF WE DON'T GET THIS OUT TODAY AND I HATE TO NOT BE A PART OF THAT BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE COMPEL GOOD. POLICY CHANGE BY FORCE AND SOMETIMES WE COMPILE IT BY AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE THAT SAYS IT IS NOW THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IN THAT FIGHT AND I AM WITH YOU. THANK YOU IF GO AHEAD DOCTOR WEBER YES I I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- HE'S BEEN VERY PERSISTENT AND WITH REGARDS TO THIS BILL AND AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HIM. AN IMPORTANT TO TO ALL OF US WHO I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT KIDS -- YOU KNOW MY MY CONTACT WITH THIS IF INFORMATION GOES WAY BACK TO WHEN I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD WHICH IS SOME TWENTY SOME ODD YEARS AGO -- WHERE THE RESEARCH BEGAN AND AND PEOPLE BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR CHANGE AND IT'S NOT AN EASY THING I THINK THE THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME EVER HAD ON SCHOOL BOY WAS SIMPLY CHANGING TIMES? WHEN SCHOOL STARTS AND STOPS? FOUR HOURS WAS FOR BUSING REASONS MUCH MORE THAN ACADEMIC REASONS AND IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO CREATE THE END OF THE WORLD FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE FROM TWENTY MINUTES TO THIRTY MINUTES. WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND AND YET AND YOU TAKE THAT HARD DECISION YOU MAKE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THEN PEOPLE GO ON WITH THEIR LIVES. THEY MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT THEY MOVE ON A EVEN FORGET WHAT THAT THE STARTING TIME USED TO BE BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE ON A DIFFERENT TIME AND AFTER. WE ADJUST THEIR LIVES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN -- THIS IS REALLY ABOUT BUT I THINK THAT THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD FOR KIDS. AND WHAT THE HELPS THEM -- TO BASICALLY IT JUST WELL AND TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL AND WE SHOULD BE SEEKING EVERY. METHOD THAT WE CAN FIND TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER FOR OUR KIDS. WE SEEM TO BE IN AN AVALANCHE OF PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF THE KIDS HAVING ISSUES AND DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE. ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE JUST FEEL OVERWHELMED BY AT AND AND WELL THIS IS NOT A SILVER BULLET IT HAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT SAYS THIS CAN BE DONE. AND IT CAN BE DONE TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR CHILDREN. AND I KNOW EVERY DISTRICT WANTS TO DECIDE IT'S ONLY ISSUES. I'VE HAD A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS WHO ASKED ME THAT WE DO THIS SO THEY THEY DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT THE BATTLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND DEAL WITH ALL THE PARENTS TO COME IN THE SCREAMING AND THE HOLLERING AND THEN THEY'RE SUBJECT TO ELECTION AND THEY DON'T. KNOW OVERWHELMED BY IT -- BUT YOU KNOW I'VE LISTEN TO THIS THE STORIES FOR A VERY LONG TIME ABOUT WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO IT AND AND ALL THE THINGS THAT. THAT YOU GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN CHARGE OF AND TO TAKE AND AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL OF THE REALITY IS WE DO A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT LOCAL CONTROL AND WITH ITS TERMS OF CURRICULUM AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE REALIZE. HAVE TO BE DONE AT THIS LEVEL THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR KIDS SO THIS IS A DIFFICULT. DECISION -- BUT IT'S ONE THAT I THINK IS IS WORTH DOING. AND EVEN ONE OF OUR MEMBERS TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME WAS ON THE FLOOR AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OUR KIDS. EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE MONEY FOR BUSING IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OUTCOME IT'S WORTH WHATEVER THE EXPENSES THAT WE SAVE ONE LIFE. IT IS TRULY WORTH IT IF WE CAN TRANSFORM MANY OF THE SCHOOLS TO HIGHER PERFORMING SCHOOLS -- IT IS TRULY WORTH IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TRIED SO MUCH AND WE HAVE PUT SO MUCH MONEY INTO SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE NOT WORKED. AND AND IT BRINGS WEEK MAKES ME QUITE SAD YOU KNOW I WAS AT A SCHOOL. OF THIS WEEKEND AT A AT A SWIM MEET FOR MY GRANDKIDS. WHEN I JUST HAPPEN TO LOOK AT THE DATA FOR THE SCHOOL BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL NEED TO FIND WHERE IT WAS AND? AND WAS IN A COMMUNITY -- AND IT MACAM COMMUNIS MAJORITY WHITE BUT IT'S SUPPORT COMMUNITY AND I WAS I WAS REALLY QUITE UPSET WHEN I GOT THERE TO THIS AND AND I LOOK AT THE DATA THAT OVER HALF OF THE KIDS DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. OVER HALF OF THE KIDS IN THIS DISTRICT DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. AND THEY'RE IN THE 30% OFF AND ON AND ON AND ON AND WENT ON AND ON AND AND I WAS JUST LIKE MY GOODNESS WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WHY ISN'T THERE. A BILL BEING WRONG WHY ISN'T THERE SOME ALARM OCCURRING. AND AND I KNOW THAT IN THIS ONE COMMUNITY THERE'S A LOT OF DRINKING THERE'S A LOT OF OF CAR ACCIDENTS THAT HAPPEN IS A LOT OF TRAUMA AND STRESS. AND IN THE END ONE OF THE EAST COUNTY SCHOOLS IN SENEGAL COUNTY AND IT'S NOT IN MY DISTRICT BUT I JUST HAPPEN TO LOOK AT THE DATA OF WHAT I SAW AND I SAW A LOT OF TRAGEDY. AND A LOT OF PAIN IN THIS DISTRICT JUST LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION OF AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND I'VE GOT TO TALK TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO'S THAT THE SCHOOLS A MEMBER THERE. WHY HAVEN'T YOU SET A SET THE ALARM WHY HAVEN'T YOU RAISE THIS ISSUE I MEAN IT'S INCOME IT IS UNACCEPTABLE IN THIS IN THIS DAY AND AGE TO HAVE OVER 50% OF YOUR KIDS NOT GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL? AND AND SO I THINK THERE'S JUST SO MANY THINGS GOING ON IN SO MUCH PAIN IS SO MUCH DIFFICULTY IN FAMILIES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING. TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE -- SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IS IS WORKING ON BASICALLY DOING THEIR DISTRICT AND IN THIS WAY BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB. IT WILL BE TO BEEN DOING AND IF THIS CAN HELP. ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM SOLVE SOME OF IT WE CAN'T SO I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR COMING TODAY. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS AGAIN BECAUSE I'VE COME UP LIKE I SAID I'VE KNOWN THIS FOR OVER TWENTY SOME ODD YEARS AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MOVE DISTRICTS IN THAT DIRECTION -- BUT I THINK AT THE STATE LEVEL IF WE CAN PROVIDE THE DIRECTION IN THE SUPPORT THAT'S NECESSARY THAT MAKES THE TRANSFORMATION EASIER FOR DISTRICTS WE HAVE TO DO THAT FOR OUR KIDS OF NOTHING ELSE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU A SINGLE OF MR KILEY I'M SORRY. THIS IS THAT I BELIEVE THE THIRD TIME THIS BILLS COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- AND ALTHOUGH SHE SAID IT'S NOT THE SAME BILL -- IT -- THIS TIME AROUND -- EXAMS RURAL DISTRICTS. IT -- STAGGER START TIMES FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS WHICH IT DIDN'T DO BEFORE. THE PROVIDES GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE BILL ALTHOUGH IN MY VIEW STILL NOT ENOUGH STILL NOT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY AND STILL HAS SOME WAY TO GO IN THAT RESPECT -- WHEN I'VE BEEN WHEN I FAILED TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL IN THE PAST? IT'S BEEN. A DIFFICULT DECISION BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE I THINK IS QUITE POWERFUL I THINK THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY THERE ARE SOME. CONFLICTING STUDIES BUT THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THERE ARE BENEFITS ALONG. SEVERAL DIMENSIONS -- TO OUR KIDS WHEN WE START SCHOOL LATER AND OUT FROM REDUCE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS. TO GRAB INCREASE GRADUATION RATES TO IMPROVED ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE -- AND TO WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME WAS THAT MENTAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES THIS IS BEEN A FOCUS OF OUR COMMITTEE WE CONVENE AND ADD A INFORMATIONAL HEARING EARLIER THIS YEAR. REALLY FOCUSED ON THE VERY SERIOUS ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR SCHOOLS THE CHAIR AND I HAVE JOINTLY AUTHORED BILLS TO TRY TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR SCHOOLS AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT THE EVIDENCE. HERE IS VERY POWERFUL WHEN IT COMES TO THE IMPACT ON YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH OVER SIXTY STUDIES LINK SLEEP LOSS WITH SUICIDES TEENAGER THE MOST SLEEP DEPRIVED AGE GROUP THEY'RE DEVELOPING BRAINS. ARE ALSO THE MOST VULNERABLE TO SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND THE RISK OF SUICIDE DECREASES BY ELEVEN AT PERCENT. WITH EACH ADDITIONAL HOUR OF SLEEP. SO WHAT HELD ME BACK FROM SUPPORTING THE BILL IN THE PAST IS THIS IDEA OF LOCAL CONTROL. AT THESE DECISIONS ARE BEST MADE BY IN AT THE LEVEL WHERE IT IS CLOSEST TO THE FAMILIES THAT ARE AFFECTED. AND AND LOCAL CONTROL ALLOWS FOR DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO BE TRIED AND SUCCESS TO BE REPLICATED THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T. ALLOW FOR NEARLY ENOUGH LOCAL CONTROL IN THE STATE. WE HAVE -- THIS FIRM IS INVOKED SO SELECTIVELY. OUR EDUCATION CODE IS WAY THICKER THAN IT SHOULD BE COMPARED TO OTHER STATE IS ONE OF THE REASONS OUR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. LACK. AND IT'S TRUE THAT I'VE HAD OVER THE COURSE OF THAT. THREE TIMES I CONSIDER THIS BILL MANY SCHOOL LEADERS DISTRICT LEADERS SCHOOL WHERE MEMBERS REACH OUT AND SAY THIS IS A MATTER FOR OUR DISTRICT TO THE SIDE -- AFTER RECEIVING INPUT FROM OUR COMMUNITY. BUT LIKE DOCTOR WEBER I'VE ALSO HEARD. FROM SCHOOL LEADERS AND DISTRICT LEADERS. WHO SAY THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION BUT THERE ARE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO DOING SO -- THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ONE OF THE DISTRICTS IN THE AREA I REPRESENT -- MADE THE POINT THAT IF THEY'RE JUST RECORDED CHANGED AND THEY'D BE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE NEIGHBORING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH WOULD PRESENT A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF ENTRY EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. AND OTHER THINGS AND THERE'S EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS IDEAS WELL THERE'S AN ARTICLE HERE FROM THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION -- AND HEALTH WOOD SAYS THE BECAUSE OF LOCAL WISE CONTROL NEIGHBORING SCHOOLS ARE NOT ANSWERABLE TO EACH OTHER AND REGIONAL ATTEMPTS AT CHANGE CAN BE THWARTED BY ONE SCHOOL BOARD. LOCAL CONTROL HAS BECOME IN THIS INSTANCE THE REASON THAT SCHOOL LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ABILITY TO ACT ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NATION'S PEDIATRICIANS. LOCAL CONTROL BECOMES LOCAL LACK OF CONTROL. THIS PARADOX AND OF COURSE THE OVERWHELMING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS WHY MANY EXPERTS ARE CALLING FOR THE STATE'S TO STEP IN THE STATE HEALTHY BOUNDARIES. FOR SCHOOL START TIMES. SO. BECAUSE OF THIS COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM I THINK THE LOCAL CONTROL ARGUMENT AT LEAST CUTS BOTH WAYS. AT THAT POINT I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR TO DEFER TO THE OVERALL IN WYOMING WEIGHT OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AS FAR AS WHAT IS IN THE INTEREST. OF OUR KIDS -- NOW THAT BEING SAID I AS I SAID BEFORE I STILL DON'T THINK THERE IS ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY. IN THE BILL SO I JUST WANT TO ASK THE AUTHOR I WOULD YOU COMMIT AND FOR WHAT IT IS ONE EXAMPLE WITH DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A ULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS OF RATE LEVELS. THIS CAN PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION OTHER THINGS SO I WHAT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO COMMIT TO WORKING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES TO ARRIVE AT THE RIGHT LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY BEFORE -- THIS BILL GOES INTO EFFECT SO FIRST OF ALL OF THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS -- THE COMMENT YOU MADE ARE ARE VERY VERY HELPFUL CONVERSATION AND I APPRECIATE YOU'VE DELVING SO DEEP INTO IT. BECAUSE YOU HAD THE HEART OF THE AP HEADED OUT OF THE PARK. THE REASON WHY THIS BILL HAS A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION CYCLE I MEAN I RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE SAID TODAY OR JANUARY ONE WHEN THIS BE BECOME LAW. YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR BILL SCHEDULE [inaudible] THAT FALL. WE KNOW THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK THE REASON WHY THIS BILL HAS A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION CYCLE. IS PRECISELY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU BROUGHT UP IS TO WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS. YOU KNOW THIS WILL FRANKLY FORCE DISTRICTS THE PLAN FOR THE CHANGE WHICH WILL IDENTIFY IT'S MY INTENT. DURING THAT THREE YEARS I HAVE FIVE AND A HALF YEARS LEFT HERE. TO WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS IN CONCERT AND IN COLLABORATION TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS FOR EXAMPLE. ONE LEGITIMATE ISSUE THAT'S COME UP THERE'S A HANDFUL OF SCHOOLS OUT THERE THAT DON'T HAVE LIGHTS. ON THEIR SPORTS FIELDS THAT'S A LEGITIMATE. ISSUE YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO WORK ON A FUNDING SOURCE TO TRY TO HELP THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE LIGHTS DURING THAT SO YES I WOULD TOTALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND THE CHAIR AND MISS SMITH YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR POINTS WERE WERE WELL TAKEN -- TO THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. WE HAVE THREE YEARS TO WORK ON IT IN CONCERT BUT IF EVERYBODY SAYING NO. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SIT DOWN CONVERSATION. THAT GIVES THAT THE ROBUST -- FOCUS WE NEED SO YES OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES. YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS ISSUE AND I'M I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.-THANK YOU. I SEE NO FURTHER COMMENT -- YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU -- AND TAKE THE CHAIR YOU KNOW. I I KNOW THAT. WHEN THERE'S A CHANGE THIS DRAMATIC? YOU KNOW IT'S HARD -- YOU HAVE EXPERTS IN THE CLASSROOM YOU HAVE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WHO HAVE STRUGGLE WITH THESE ISSUES -- THE COMMENTS YOU'VE ALL MADE OUR OUR JERMAINE AND AND THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO ASK WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON WORKING FAMILIES WELL. THAT'S THE RIGHT QUESTION. THE DATA SHOWS THAT UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM THERE'S A SOCIAL INEQUITY IN WORKING CHILDREN WORKING FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ARE THE MOST DISADVANTAGED AND GET THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SLEEP. UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHO GETS THE BIGGEST BENEFIT AFTER THE CHANGE. THAT COHORT OF STUDENTS. WERE ASKING THE APPROPRIATE QUESTION ABOUT GETS THE BIGGEST BENEFIT -- TRANSPORTATION COSTS THE REASON WHY WE STAGGERED MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. THIS YEAR IS TO HELP OFFSET ANY POTENTIAL TRANSPORTATION COSTS THOUGH MOST OF THE DATA AND RESEARCH SHOWS. THERE IS AN INCREASED COST AND SOME DATA SHOWS THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR SCHOOL DISTRICT INVEST THEY GET FOUR DOLLARS IN RETURN [inaudible] THE BILL ITSELF. SETTING. STANDARD. IT SAYS NO EARLIER THAN THAT DOESN'T MEAN DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADJUST. AND AS POINTED OUT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER KILEY. BY RESPECTING THE SCIENCE ON MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND SETTING THAT MINIMUM. FOR FOR EIGHT FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND A MINIMUM FOR FOR HIGH SCHOOLS AT EIGHT THIRTY AGAIN THOSE ARE MINIMUMS ALLOWS DISTRICTS THAT FLEXIBILITY. TO WORK IN CONCERT WITH THEIR TRANSPORTATION FOLKS TO ADJUST THEIR SCHEDULES WE'VE LEFT OUT. THE LITTLE KIDS ON PURPOSE FOR TWO REASONS A THEIR SCIENCE AND BRAIN CHEMISTRY IS DIFFERENT AND BE THAT ALSO GIVES DISTRICTS THE FLEXIBILITY. FOR THAT THE CHAIRS COMMENT ABOUT THE SERVING CLASS AND ZERO APPEARED AGAIN THE RIGHT QUESTION TO ASK ZERO PERIOD. IS EXEMPT FROM THIS BILL WAS FIRST PERIOD JUST TO BE CLEAR DON'T DON'T MISS. BUT CHARACTERS MY STATES MOVES ABOUT FIRST PERIOD NOT NOT ZERO PER SERVING CLASSES DURING FIRST PERIOD. I'LL BE CLEAR IN A NON NEGOTIABLE AND I WILL SUBMIT AND COMMIT TO THE CHAIR TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THE CITY THE SURFING CLASS. WORK FOR ANYBODY WANTS BY THE WAY THIS MAY SHOCK YOU. BUT I ACTUALLY SERVED WHEN I WAS A KID. I DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THIS. BUT AND WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO GET IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THERE WAS A SURFER'S BEACH. AND OF COURSE WE ALL WOULD GO OVER TO THE SURFERS BEACH BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE ALL THE COOL KIDS WERE -- BUT ANYWAY PSYCH SUBMIT TO TO TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE APPROPRIATE WAY. TO ADDRESS. WHETHER THAT FITS THE DEFINITION OF A ZERO PERIOD BECAUSE IT'S VOLUNTARY OR NOT. YOU KNOW I'M NOT LOOKING TO MAKE THIS BILL. ARE JEWISH BUT I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBBER'S -- PERCEPTION ABOUT DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE SAYING OFF LINE GOD I HOPE THIS BILL PASSES I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE COME UP TO ME AND SAID. I'VE READ ALL THE RESEARCH I'D LOVE TO MOVE MY SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH. WITH WITH. THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE SO PLEASE DO IT THE STAGGERED. EXTRACURRICULAR AGAIN PERFECT EXAMPLE THERE ARE DISTRICTS OUT THERE THAT WANT TO MOVE. BUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO ON STAGGER THEIR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES SO ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED. ARE THE RIGHT QUESTIONS WE THINK THE SCIENCE THE RESEARCH THE LACK OF INCREASED COSTS WE THINK IT'S IT JUSTIFIES. MAKING THIS MINIMUM STANDARD BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE PEDIATRICIANS ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR KIDS. SHOULD BE THE OVERRIDING GOAL AND AS WHAT'S BEEN SAID IF WE SAVE ONE LIFE. THAT'S WORTH IT. THANK YOU SENATE ONE LIFE THAT'S WORTH IT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- MOTION IS -- DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS THERE'S BEEN A A MOTION AND A SECOND -- MATHEMATICS AFTER PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL NO O'DONNELL NO KILEY. KILEY AYE DEEP KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY SMITH. SMITH NOT VOTING WEBER WEBER I THOSE THREE THE BILL AS IS ON BECAUSE THREE VOTES YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL YOU'RE PRESENTING YES I DO AND I GET TO THAT IN AN ON CALL I APPRECIATE IT AND THE TIME YOU GAVE US. THANK YOU [inaudible] FILE ITEM [inaudible] SIX NINE ONE NINE FILE NUMBER SIX FILE ITEM OR SIX SB. SIX NINE FIVE YOU MAY. PROCEED WHEN READY I HAVE ANOTHER EASY BILL. AS CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH MY STAFF. OVER THE THREE YEARS ON THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE -- I KNOW KRISTY LOPEZ FROM MY STAFF AND YOUR STAFF. HAVE REALLY REALLY WORKED HARD TO GET THIS BILL WHERE IT IS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB SIX NINE FIVE WHICH REQUIRES A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY TO PROVIDE A STUDENT'S PARENT. WITH A COPY OF THE COMPLETED INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN OR IEP FOR THE EIGHT MOST COMMONLY SPOKEN LANGUAGES IN THAT DISTRICT. WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF BEING REQUESTED AS WELL AS REQUIRE THE AYE HE PIECE TO BE TRANSLATED BY A QUALIFIED TRANSLATOR. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRE CD TO REVISE ITS NOTICE OF PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS IN ORDER TO INFORM PARENTS OF THEIR RIGHT TO REQUEST. THE TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENTS EXISTING LAW ALLOWS FOR TRANSLATED COPY OF THE IEP BUT DOES NOT SET A TIME LINE FOR IP DOCUMENTS TO BE TRANSLATED -- WE'VE HEARD STORIES FROM PARENTS THAT IT TOOK UP TO A YEAR TO RECEIVE THE DOCUMENTS AND IT APPEARED. TO BE TRANSLATED USING A POPULAR SEARCH ENGINE NOT AN ACTUAL TRANSLATOR. THE IEP PROCESS CAN BE OVERWHELMING AND INTIMIDATED FOR SOMEONE FROM IT -- NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS OF THE TERMINOLOGY IS SPECIALLY OF THAT PERSON'S PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH. THE LACK OF HAVING A TIMELY AND ACCURATE TRANSLATED IP DOES A GREAT DISSERVICE TO BOTH THE PARENTS AND THE STUDENTS THINK ABOUT. HOW PRECIOUS TIME IS TO THOSE EARLY LEARNERS IF YOU DELAY KNOWING WHAT YOUR I. E. P. IS FOR A YEAR? THAT'S IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE YOUNG PERSON SO THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS FOR PARENTS HAVE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION. IN THEIR CHILD CHILDREN'S IP PROCESS WHICH IS REQUIRED BY LAW AND ALSO TO PROVIDE PARENTS WITH A TRANSLATED COPY OF THE I. R. P. I. E. P. WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME SO. I HAVE ERIC HARRIS FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ FROM COALITION OF HUMAN IMMIGRATION RIGHTS TO SPEAK ON THE MERITS OF SB. SIX NINETY FIVE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS AND I'M A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA.

SIX NINE FIVE FIVE YOU PROCESS AS MENTIONED BY THE SENATORS VERY INTIMIDATING FOR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH MANY TIMES FAMILIES REPRESENT HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISTRESS. DURING THIS PART OF THE IEP PROCESS WHEN TRANSLATION IS NEEDED. FOR EXAMPLE PARENTS FEEL LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION IF THEIR SIDE CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING I AND I MEDIAN -- AND THEY FILL THE SOMETIMES THEIR STATED. THAT WHEN OUR STAFF HAS NOT FULLY TRANSLATED WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO CONVEY AN IP PROCESS. PARENTS BECOME MORE FRUSTRATED WHEN DOCUMENTS ARE PROVIDER NOT PROPERLY TRANSLATED IN FACT AS AS MENTIONED EARLIER SOME MEMBERS HAVE STATED THAT THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED DOCUMENTS. THAT MANY TIMES BEEN TRANSLATED BY ON MY SYSTEM SUCH AS GOOGLE TRANSLATE NOT WHICH MAKES NO SENSE IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE. SIX NINE FIVE ENSURE THAT FAMILIES ARE ENGAGED IN IP PROCESS ARE NOT TREATED AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS BY ENSURING DOCUMENTS PROVIDED. DURING IP PROCESS ARE PROPERLY TRANSLATED AND GIVEN IN A TIMELY MANNER IN DOING SO THIS BILL WILL ASSIST IN RESTORING TRUST BETWEEN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS. SCHOOLS AND OVERALL IN GOVERNMENT.

WE HAVE HAD THREE GRADUATING. THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND LEGISLATURE ABOUT -- THE REQUESTED BY. LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION. MOON FAR MORE. FAR MORE IMPORTER OR MALICE OR WHO KNOWS WHAT THEN IS THERE. AND IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE THING. BUT IT REALLY IMPACTS THE ABILITY OF THOSE KIDS TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL. AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE FAR MORE SUBJECTED AND ALL OF OUR DATA SHOW SAID TO A CATEGORY OF SUSPENSIONS CALLED WILLFUL DEFIANCE WHICH YOU CAN LOOK AT AS SORT OF AN ATTITUDINAL THING. AND THAT THERE SUSPENDED FOR THAT -- AND WHEN YOU'RE SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL. THAT ISN'T A GREAT RECIPE FOR SUCCESS IN SCHOOL YOU'RE IN EFFECT IT'S COMMUNICATES THAT HEY WE DON'T WANTYOU HERE SO WHY SHOULD YOU WANT TO BE WHERE YOU'RE NOT WANTED. AND ADDITIONALLY YOUR LOSS OF THAT SCHOOL ING GET YOU BEHIND. IN YOUR CLASSES. SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS FOR SOME TIME AND LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET. THERE WAS MADE PERMANENT THE ELIMINATION OF THIS SINGLE CATEGORY OF OF SUSPENSIONS CALLED WILLFUL DEFIANCE IN GRADES. KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THIRD. NOW THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MANY -- ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING EVEN OUR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION SAID AS WANTED TO GO FURTHER SO THE BILL YOU HAVE TODAY IS A BILL THAT WOULD MAKE. THERE WOULD ELIMINATE WILLFUL STIFF FINES SUSPENSIONS THROUGH GRADE FIVE SO ADDING TO WHAT WE ALREADY DID. BY ADDING GRADES FOUR AND FIVE TO THAT PERMANENT THIRD AND THEN. ELIMINATING WILL FOLDS DEFINED SUSPENSIONS. THROUGH FOR GRADE SIX AND EIGHT SIX SEVEN EIGHT SIX THREE WITH A FIVE YEAR SUNSET SORTS NOT PERMANENT. IT HAS A FIVE YEAR SUNSET -- NOW I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS ISSUE STILL ADDRESS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BUT I APPRECIATE THE ARGUMENTS. AND NINE MEAN ARGUMENTS BUT IAPPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THAT HIGH SCHOOL IS DIFFERENT. AND THAT -- THE THE BEHAVIOR IN HIGH SCHOOLS DIFFERENT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WHAT OPTIONS THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS AND SUCH HAVE -- SO I RESPECT VERY MUCH THE WAY THE BILL'S CONSTRUCTED. AND THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE TAKEN. BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION OVER TIME AROUND. ALSO TRYING TO LOOK AT CREATING THE MOST [inaudible] OPTIMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR STUDENTS TO SUCCEED AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO TESTIFY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN I THINK I IS AND I'M A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD RISING SENIOR AT GARFIELD HIGH SCHOOL. I'M HERE WITH INNER CITY STRUGGLE THE BROTHERS THEMSELVES COALITION AN ALLEY COUNTY AND THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR NINETEEN BECAUSE AS A STUDENT I FEEL THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT HAS BECOME SAFER SINCE WE ENDED WILLFUL DEFINES AS A MEANS OF SUSPENSION. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE BROTHERS SON SELVES COALITION AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND HOW THEY PASSED THE SCHOOL CLIMB A BILL OF RIGHTS IN LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. ONE OF THE THINGS THE SCHOOL CLIMB A BILL OF RIGHTS DID WAS AND SUSPENSIONS IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR DEFIANCE. I WAS A FIFTH GRADER AT THE TIME. BECAUSE OF THAT STUDENTS WERE NO LONGER PULLED OUT OF CLASS AND SUSPENDED FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS LIKE WEARING A HAT HAVING YOUR BIRDS IN CHEWING GUM. AND THEY WEREN'T FORCED TO MISS VALUABLE CLASS TIME. BECAUSE OF THIS I FELT SAFE REGISTERED. AS BEFORE NINETEEN ALLOW STUDENTS TO STAYING CLASS FURTHER. STAY IN CLASS AND FURTHER THEIR EDUCATION RATHER THAN BE BOTH BE PULLED OUT AND FALL BEHIND ON CLASS WORK. AND A STUDENTS EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTED. NOT USE AS A THREAT AGAINST THEM. BECAUSE OF AS BEFORE NINETEEN STUDENTS WHO ARE DEEMED HARD TO DEAL WITH. WILL NOT WILL NO LONGER BE THROWN OUT OF CLASS OR SUSPENDED BECAUSE IT'S CONVENIENT. RATHER RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES WILL BE IN IMPLEMENTED. RELATIONSHIPS CONVERSATIONS TRUSTS AND DIALOGUE WILL BE PUT IN THE PLACE OF PUNISHMENTS. STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO THE TO THE TEACHERS ARE SITUATIONS AND TEACHERS WOULD BE ABLE TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE STUDENTS AND FIND A WAY TO HELP THEM. I STATED EARLIER LA YOU IS THE HAS ALREADY ENDED WILLFUL DEFINES AS A MEANS OF SUSPENSION. AND IT HAS SERVED AS A POSITIVE EDUCATIONAL CATALYST. AS A STUDENT I HAVE SEEN OF ASKED CHANGING CLASSROOMS. AND HAS BEEN BETTER. BETTER FOR EVERYONE. STUDENTS OF COLOR AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE NO LONGER BEING HEAVILY SUSPENDED AS THEY WERE BEFORE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT ALL STUDENTS IN THE STATE DESERVE THIS PROTECTION NOT JUST YOUNG ADULTS [inaudible] YOUNG. ALTHOUGH S. BEFORE NINETEEN DOES NOT PROTECT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WE HOPE THE LEGISLATOR IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US. TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE GROUPS LIKE STUDENTS OF COLOR. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND LGBT STUDENTS. I HOPE TO SEE THIS IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE NATION. ONE BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS. HAS THAT BEEN HERE. SO I CAME HERE TO IMPLORE YOU PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL. PLEASE SUPPORT STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU IS THERE ANOTHER WHAT ANOTHER WITNESS YES GOOD AFTERNOON. MR CHEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS YVONNE CARRY ON WITH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. ACCESS PROUD TO SUPPORT AS BEFORE ONE NINE BECAUSE WILL FOR DEFIANCE POLICIES CONTINUE TO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT STUDENTS OF COLOR AND BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES FOR DEALING WITH REAL AND PERCEIVED IT DEFINES. THE MAJORITY OF ACCESS MEMBERSHIP IS MADE UP OF PRINCIPALS AND VICE PRINCIPALS. WHOSE JOB INCLUDES -- HANDLING DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AND MANAGING CAMPUS SCHOOL CLIMATE. IN THIS SEGMENT OF OUR MEMBERSHIP REPORTS HAVING SUCCESS IMPLEMENTING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES THAT STRENGTH AND STUDENT CONNECTEDNESS. REDUCE NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS AND IMPROVE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THESE INCLUDE PROGRAMS THAT DEVELOP MEANING MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STAFF AND STUDENTS. ONES THAT RECOGNIZE AND REWARD POSITIVE BEHAVIORS -- PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE PEER TO PEER ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION. BUT EVEN AS MORE AND MORE SCHOOLS ARE IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGIES AND REDUCING THEIR USE OF SUSPENSIONS ACTS A BELIEVES THAT WILL FOR DEFIANCE MUST BE ELIMINATED. ACCESS CANNOT SUPPORT A POLICY THAT OVERWHELMINGLY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS MAKE UP JUST OVER 5% OF THE STATE'S STUDENT POPULATION GET REPRESENT NEARLY 16% OF THOSE WERE SUSPENDED FOR WILLFUL DEFIANCE. BLACK STUDENTS ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SUSPENDED FOR WORLD WILL FOR THE FINANCE THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS. AND RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS THE RISK INVOLVED WITH SUSPENDING YOU'VE. KIDS WHO ARE SUSPENDED ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. AND ELEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. STUDENTS ARE SAFEST AND BEST SERVED WHEN AT SCHOOL FOR THESE REASONS ACCESS SUPPORTS AS BEFORE ONE NINE A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

URBAN YOUTH JUST COALITION HERE'S A SPORT I IN CARE OF FRAUD CASE K. THROUGH TWELVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SIGNAL FOR THEIR OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU CENTER -- I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE ANGELES HAND PUBLIC COUNCIL I'M SORRY ANGELA TURNER PUBLIC COUNCIL IN SUPPORT OKAY THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE -- AT OPPOSITION YEAH I DO HAVE THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I APOLOGIZE. SEEING OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HERE AND I'LL JUST COMMENT THANK YOU FOR THE BILL SENATOR I KNOW MY CONCERN IS REALLY ALL SUSPENSIONS. AND HAVING BEEN IN A HIGH SCHOOL FOR MANY YEARS -- I WOULD NOT I'M NOT ONE THAT WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD NEVER SUSPEND THERE ARE CERTAIN INSTANCES WORLD REALLY FOR SAFETY ISSUES ALONE SOMETIMES YOU MUST SUSPEND BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER SUSPENDED FOR WEARING A HAT. AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE THAN SUSPENDING A STUDENT BECAUSE ARE LATE FOR SCHOOL. SO IF THOSE THINGS ARE GOING ON I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY HAVE A LEGAL OR NEED A LOT OF PROBLEM YOU'RE PROBABLY HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM -- AND I'M THE KIND OF TEACHER YOU KNOW I I DIDN'T KEEP REFERRALS MY DESK I WAS IN THAT WHAT KIND OF GUY I CAN'T TELL YOU IF EITHER YEARS. YEARS WENT BY WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN WRITE -- ONE BECAUSE YOU USE YOUR PEOPLE SKILLS RIGHT THE RELEASE OF THEIR KIDS THEIR GROWING. AND YOU GOTTA BE FLEXIBLE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW FLEXIBILITY INFLEXIBLE -- SO I APPRECIATE THAT AGAIN MY REAL CONCERN IS ALL SUSPENSIONS AND I KNOW THIS YEAR'S. TOO SO I'M AND I DON'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU -- SO I SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL AND WILL HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS CLEARLY -- WITH THAT I THINK DOCTOR WEBER WANTED TO COME RIGHT I WANT -- TO ARE CLEARLY THINK -- SENATE FOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IN AND THIS IS BEEN SOMETHING ON THE AGENDA FOR AT LEAST A LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE -- AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE TO AMENDED TO LEAVE UP THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BECAUSE THAT REALLY IS ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES THAT'S THERE THAN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT -- I GUESS IT WAS PROBABLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO I WAS ASKED INVITED TO GO TO WASHINGTON NEW YORK. TO PARTICIPATE IN A CONVERSATION CONCERNING SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING I WAS INVITED SO I WENT AND I EXPECTED TO YOU KNOW TO LEARN A LOT FROM FOLKS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THE WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND A LOT OF THEM WITH THEIR BUT WHAT SHOCKED ME MOST WAS I GOT THE IN WHO WAS LEADING THE CONVERSATION AS A THOR HE'S IN THE ROOM WAS AT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IN CALIFORNIA -- AND THEY HAD ALL THE RESEARCH AND ALL THE DATA IN ALL THE INFORMATION IT JUST KIND OF BLEW ME AWAY BECAUSE YOU I DON'T SEE THEM PRESENTING THAT DATE AND THAT INFORMATION AND DRIVING IF YOU'RE CALIFORNIA. AND SO I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED THAT THEY WERE THERE AND AND AND AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS WORK AND AND WERE REALLY STRONG SUPPORT IS AGAINST US THE SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS. AND AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE INFORMING OTHER STATES ABOUT THIS ISSUE WHEN WE WOULD NOT LEADING IN PRACTICE SO I JUST FOUND IT EXTREMELY. INTERESTING FOR ME TO COME THERE AND REALIZING THAT I WAS WALKING IN TO BE ON THE TEAM OF EXPERTS -- WHEN I THOUGHT I'D BE HEARING FROM OUR OWN DEPARTMENT -- OR HEARING FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THEM AS TO WHAT NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO I EVEN TODAY I STILL DON'T SEE THEM HERE LEADING THE CHARGE. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF WORK ON A LOTS OF RESEARCH ON AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- THAT WE NEED TO TAKE THE LEAD ON IT'S IT'S I MEAN I DON'T WITH THIS WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL WERE TWENTY SOME YEARS AGO ABOUT THE OVER SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS OF KIDS IN THE OUTCOMES AND AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WAS SO UNFAIR AND SOMEONE JUST. IN DEALING WITH THE CHILDREN OF THAT WOULD BEARD WHO WAS GETTING SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED AND EVEN WHEN WE WOULD ELIMINATED THEY'D BE THE KIDS SITTING IN THE HALLWAY RATHER THAN IN THE CLASSROOM FOR INSTRUCTION. SO WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB AND WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO I MEAN I WAS LISTENING TO ALL OF OUR EXPERTS TALK ABOUT AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF. YOU KNOW IT ARE WE GIVING THIS INFORMATION FOR TRAINING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND ARE WE HELPING FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HOW THEY'RE DOING AND IT JUST SEEMS. TO BE SUCH A TREMENDOUS DISCONNECT HERE IN THE STATE BETWEEN WHAT OUR DEPARTMENT WAS DOING THIS ABOUT FOUR YEARS A SO WHAT I'VE DEPARTMENT KNEW AND WAS DOING IN RECOMMENDING. AND YET WHAT WE WERE DOING IN TERMS OF PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO -- I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE -- WE NEED TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE REALLY LOUD ALLOW THE RESEARCH IN THE WORK THAT WE DO WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT. TO DRIVE THE ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPORT FOR AT OUR SCHOOLS IN THIS AREA BECAUSE IT IS EIGHT EIGHT IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ALL THE DATA IS CLEAR WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KIDS WHEN THEY'RE SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED. EARLY IN LIFE PARTICULARLY -- WAS STILL SUSPENDING KIDS IN KINDERGARTEN AND ALL THAT STUFF THE DEADLY MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE -- BUT I I I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND YOU EFFORTS AND I THINK WE HAVE TO JUST CONTINUE TO PUSH A LITTLE BIT HARDER. MOVE THE BILL. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. AND I SAID ONE HIGHLIGHT THAT THE SUSPENSION RATE IS NOW PART OF THE DASHBOARD. YES REALLY YES TELLS A LOT RIGHT AND REALLY MAKES DISTRICTS PAY ATTENTION OR NOT JUST. FOR THE FINAL FOR ALL ALL REASONS -- SO WITH THAT I SEE NO FOR THE COMING FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER KALRA THANK YOU MISTER HAND UP SHAPER SHOULD -- AND AND HAVE I OBVIOUSLY HAD THE STEP UP FOR ANOTHER QUICK MEETINGS DID GET A CHANCE TO HEAR SOME OF THE DIALOGUE BUT I CAN GUESS AS TO WHERE SOME OF IT WAS AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT. ANY EFFORT -- FOR US TO REDUCE -- THE USE OF WILL FOR DEFIANCE -- IN A MANNER THAT IS EXCLUDING -- STUDENTS FROM TO SPANISH CASES BECAUSE WE KNOW WHO THE TARGET IS OFTENTIMES TO DATE AT LEAST OF WILLFUL DEFIANCE AND AND I I OR FRANKLY. I I SECOND OTHER COMMENTS A AS I WAS WALKING HEARING FROM DOCTOR WEBER -- ABOUT THE EXCLUSION OF THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING A MUCH OF THE DISPARITY THAT THERE'S OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS -- OF THAT BOARD EVER REASON -- A TEACHER MAY BELIEVE IS NOT ENGAGING IN A WAY THAT'S HELPFUL TO THEM. I THINK THAT -- HAVING. I I THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY EVEN AS THIS BILL -- GOES FORWARD TO BETTER DEFINE. BOTH OF WILL FOR THE FINANCES THE SUBJECT SUBJECTIVITY OF IT THAT IS SUCH THE IS SO MUCH AN ISSUE WE HAVE OTHER. BILL'S GOING FORWARD IN THIS BODY REGARDING AN IMPLICIT BIAS FOR EXAMPLE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. AND THE EMPRESS OF BY IS THAT EXIST AMONGST ALL OF US AS PART OF THE OF THE DATA THAT OCCURS REGARDING WILLFUL DEFIANCE SUSPENSIONS EXPULSIONS WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT -- IS A DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS -- PARTICULARLY -- THE YOUNG MEN OF COLOR BUT CERTAINLY YOUNG STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND THE SUSPENSION SHOULD BE MADE VERY CLEARLY IS AN OPTIONAL LAST RESORT -- WHEN ADDRESSING BOTH OF DEFIANCE RATHER RATHER THAN REMOVING IT I UNDERSTAND CERTAINLY THE THE CHAIR AND OTHERS CONCERNS OF HAVING ALL THE TOOLS AVAILABLE BECAUSE TEACHING IS NOT EASY? AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TEACHERS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TEACH ALL OTHER STUDENTS AND AND THAT THERE'S ISSUES WITH ANY GIVEN STUDENT THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED I THINK THAT WE SHOULD. BUT IT TO THAT POINT THERE SHOULD BE AS MANY TOOLS AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN THE SUSPENSION ROUTE -- PROVOKE OR SHORT OF THE SUSPENSION ROUTE AND SOME HOLE I HOPE THAT. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND AS THIS ISSUE CONTINUES TO BE DEBATED -- IN THE IN THE YEARS AHEAD THAT WE HAVE A RECOGNITION THAT WE SHOULD USE ALL TO WHAT THE THE ALL THE TOOLS AVAILABLE SHOULD BE USED TO LIFT UP OUR STUDENTS AND TO PROVIDE. CERTAINLY A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERYONE BUT REALLY DAHLE AND GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE HEALING ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. OF ANY ISSUES THAT THEY MAY BE GOING THROUGH THAT'S KEEPING THEM FROM HAVING A FULL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLING. US WITHOUT A A WILL SUPPORT THE BILL ALTHOUGH I DO THINK -- THAT -- BUT I I WOULD SUPPORT IT PRIOR TO AMENDMENTS -- AND AND THINK THERE'S STILL AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THIS IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT THAT. CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE CHILD ON THE STUDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU A SINGLE FOR THE COMMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE THERE HAS BEEN IN MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED -- I KNOW I CAN GET THERE.

THANK YOU SHERMAN I AM -- HERE TODAY IT HAS TAKEN THE TIME TO INTRODUCE THIS MEASURE. TO CORRECTIVE ANOMALY. IN THE DESIGN BUILD METHOD AS IT RELATES TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLS. THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION IN CASE OF TOWARD A ABOUT WHETHER WHEN YOU HAVE A DESIGN BUILD CONTRACT. AND THE END SEQUEL UC BOTH ON TWO SEPARATE PASS WITH THE CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. AND SO IF SO IF IF THE SCHOOL BOARD APPROVES THE DESIGN BUILD PROCESS. IS THAT CONSIDERED APPROVAL OR NOT. SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO CLARIFY. AS WE DEAL WITH ALL THESE GREAT ISSUES OF WILD FIRES AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AND ALL THE GREAT ISSUES OF THE DAY. OFTEN THE MECHANICS OF GOVERNMENT ARE INFORMED BY THINGS IT APPEARS SMALL. BUT IMPACT IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY THE OPERATION OF GOVERNMENT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING. TO CORRECT THAT -- WITH THE BUILDING TRADES AS PART OF THIS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AWARDING OF A CONTRACT. APPROVING DESIGN BUILD IT -- PROJECT -- IF FOR TWO PURPOSES DOES NOT WORK CAN CONTRADICTION WITH WITH C. CUT. AND WITH THIS. I HAVE MY WITNESS TALK AND FURTHER EXPLAINED. THE PROBLEM WITH HERSELF. THANK YOU TERRY MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS OLGA SHILOH WITH LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- WE ARE PLEASED TO BE THE SPONSOR OF SB SEVEN FORTY THREE WHICH CLARIFIES THAT DESIGN BUILD PROJECT DELIVERY METHOD. DESIGNED BILL PROJECT DELIVERY METHOD PROVIDES MANY EFFICIENCIES TO SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS INCLUDING COST EFFECTIVE USE OF FUNDS AND EX BUT I TO PROJECT COMPLETION. SINCE DESIGN BILLS TOUCHES WERE ORIGINALLY MADE OPERATIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO LA UNIFIED HAS AWARDED TWENTY THREE CONTRACTS OF A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. CURRENTLY WE ARE WORKING ON A DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTS TO BE AWARDED TOTALING OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. LA UNIFIED PURSUIT DESIGN BUILD PROJECTS WHEN A DETERMINATION IS MADE THAT THE CONTRACT CONTRACTING METHOD WILL REDUCE. PROJECT COST EXPEDITED PROJECT SCHEDULE INTO PROVIDE FEATURES NOT ACHIEVABLE THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL DESIGN BED BUILD -- CONTRACTING METHODS. WE HAVE FOUND THAT A PROJECT SCHEDULED IS REDUCED BY FORTY SIX MONTHS ON AVERAGE. THE X. BUT I'D NATURE OF DESIGN BUILD WHILE TIMELY AND COST EFFECTIVE SOMETIMES RYAN RUNS INTO TIMING ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT REVIEW. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE EVALUATE WHETHER PROPOSED PROJECT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; IT IS&lt;/c&gt;</u> NECESSARY TO HAVE CERTAIN INFORMATION KNOWN. ABOUT IT IN THAT CAN ONLY BE REVEALED THROUGH THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT STAGE THIS OCCURS AFTER A CONTRACT IS AWARDED. DUE TO DEATH OFTENTIMES BOARDS OF EDUCATION APPROVED THESE CONTRACTS BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS COMPLETE. RECENTLY THE STATE DISTRICT AWARDED A DESIGN BUILD CONTRACT TO MODERNIZE WAS ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL WHICH WAS ARGUED BY SOME THAT THE ACTION MEANT THE LA UNIFIED HAD ALREADY APPROVED IN THE PROJECT. AND COMMITTED ITSELF TO AN IRREVERSIBLE INDEFINITE COURSE OF ACTION WITHOUT CONDUCTING APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW UNDER SEEK WHAT SB SEVEN FORTY THREE WHILE PROTECTING TO SEE WHAT PROCESS CLARIFIES. THE LA UNIFIED RETAINS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE A DESIGN BUILD CONTRACT. BEFORE THE PROJECT IS SUBMITTED TO THE DIVISION OF STATE ARCHITECT MODIFIED THE DESIGN AND IN CORPORATE MITIGATION MEASURES IDENTIFIED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW DOCUMENT FOR THE PROJECT. SB SEVEN FORTY THREE HARMONIZES THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS WITH THE RECOGNIZE ECONOMIC BENEFITS A FORTY TWO LA UNIFIED -- FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR SB SEVEN FORTY THREE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IPHONE.
