01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:50.078
KNOW- THE COST TO ESTABLISH A

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:52.247
NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS YOU

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:54.249
KNOW SIGNIFICANT RIGHT IRAN IS

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.884
LESS COSTLY TO EXPAND AN

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.785
EXISTING PROGRAM AND OF COURSE

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:59.621
AS LEAST COSTLY TO HAVE FIND

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:02.257
EXISTING SLOTS- BUT WENT AT THE

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.058
SAME TIME- YOU KNOW WE FEELS

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:05.493
VERY STRONGLY THAT ONE OF THAT.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.764
SONG RAP JENKINS- NOT ONLY TO

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.699
INCREASE THAT- I DIVERSITY OF-

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:14.669
THE- PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:15.570
SERVING AND WHERE THEY'RE

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:17.038
SERVING BUT IT'S REALLY TO

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.606
EXPAND THE CAPACITY TRAIN MORE

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.508
PRIMARY CARE RESIDENTS WE MEAN I

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:22.210
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A HUGE

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:23.478
SHORTAGE AND SO WE THINK THAT

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.547
THAT FUNDING PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:28.016
TO EXPAND- AND PUT DOLLARS

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:29.884
TOWARDS NEW AND EXPANSION-

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.053
REALLY HELPS ALLEVIATE SOME OF

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.988

THAT IF IT'S AN EXISTING SLOT

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:46.301
THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.937
CAN USE THE DOLLARS TO FUND

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:51.573

YOU MADAM CHAIR- YES IT WILL BE

01:48:20.293 --> 01:48:22.262
ROLLED OUT IN A VERY SIMILAR

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:24.130
FASHION WE HAVE A AN APPROACH TO

01:48:24.197 --> 01:48:25.098
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE CALL

01:48:25.165 --> 01:48:26.199
HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS

01:48:26.266 --> 01:48:28.435
THAT HAS. ALL THE SAME ELEMENTS

01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:30.036
REGARDLESS OF THE SECTOR THAT WE

01:48:30.103 --> 01:48:33.073
THAT WE- WE FOCUS ON- AS YOU

01:48:33.139 --> 01:48:34.608
KNOW WE HAVE HIGHER TRAINING

01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:35.408
PARTNERSHIPS IN A VARIETY OF

01:48:35.475 --> 01:48:37.344
SECTORS. SUCH AS HEALTHCARE-

01:48:37.410 --> 01:48:39.479
INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION.

01:48:39.546 --> 01:48:40.013
CONSTRUCTION TRADES IS A

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.616
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- SO THE

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:44.684
APPROACH IS THE SAME. ENGAGING

01:48:44.751 --> 01:48:47.220
EMPLOYERS IMPINGING INDUSTRY ARE

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:48.455
DOING A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT WORK

01:48:48.521 --> 01:48:50.257
UP FOR THAT WITH WITH INDUSTRY

01:48:50.323 --> 01:48:51.791
EMPLOYERS WORKING AS FAST AS WE

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.093
CAN BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET TO

01:48:53.159 --> 01:48:54.628
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AS FAST

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:57.030
AS WE CAN. GET OUR END GAME IS

01:48:57.097 --> 01:48:59.099

TRAINING AND TO GET QUALITY

01:49:02.068 --> 01:49:04.638
JOBS- SO I THINK THAT THE

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:07.207
DIFFERENCE HERE. IS THE URGENCY

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:09.409
AROUND HEALTHCARE AND FEELING IN

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:10.543

THE IN THE PARTS OF THE STATE-

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:16.816
SO THE DEVELOPMENT. SIDE I THINK

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:18.351
IT'S GONNA MOVE FASTER THAN WE

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:20.353

REQUEST OF NINETY NINE THIS IS

02:03:28.167 --> 02:03:30.302
ADEQUATE ON OUR END- AS

02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:36.041
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT ON OUR END

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:38.144

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:05.137
LOT OF THE AREAS THAT WE DON'T

02:04:05.204 --> 02:04:06.839

AND IF. IF THIS IS A SUFFICIENT

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:33.265
AMOUNT OF FUNDING HOW DID WE

02:04:33.332 --> 02:04:35.968
COME TO THE- ESTIMATION THAT

02:04:36.035 --> 02:04:38.237
THIS WAS THE BEST NUMBER FOR US

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:40.639

OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO VARY

02:05:23.249 --> 02:05:25.484

COHORTS OF FIFTEEN TO TWENTY.

02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:57.121
WHERE MEMBERS OF PEACE AND WHAT

02:24:57.188 --> 02:24:59.323
IS THE WEIGHT OF ONCETHE

02:24:59.390 --> 02:25:01.259
INDIVIDUALS- PARTICIPATE IN THE

02:25:01.325 --> 02:25:03.394
PROGRAM AND THEY GRADUATE FROM

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:07.165
IT WHAT IS THE- I GUESS THE

02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:09.801
RATIO OF HIGHER OF THE MEMBERS

02:25:09.867 --> 02:25:10.902

THE NINETEEN COURTS TWO HUNDRED

02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:18.543
AND FIFTY ARE WORKING. IT'S

02:25:18.609 --> 02:25:21.512
GREAT AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE

02:25:21.579 --> 02:25:26.451
AVERAGE SALARY IS OF. YES YES

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:28.219
ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YEAH

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:30.688
HE AND HE STARTS AT AROUND

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:31.589
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AN HOUR.

02:25:31.656 --> 02:25:32.490
BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:25:32.557 --> 02:25:34.058
UNDERSTAND ABOUT HIM SHE IS IT'S

02:25:34.125 --> 02:25:37.361
THE FIRST STEP. ON THE PATHWAY

02:25:37.428 --> 02:25:39.897
TO MEDIC. OR NURSE OR THE REST

02:25:39.964 --> 02:25:40.364

02:25:43.668 --> 02:25:44.769
ISSUE FOR YOUR WHOLE ENTIRE

02:25:44.836 --> 02:25:46.471
CAREER ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS. A

02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:47.872
LOT OF EMTS ARE TRYING TO GET

02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:50.274
HIRED BY FIRE. SO WHAT THAT DOES

02:25:50.341 --> 02:25:52.577
IS FIRE HIRES OUT OF THE IMPACT

02:25:52.643 --> 02:25:54.545
AND IT CREATES A NATURAL CHARM.

02:25:54.612 --> 02:25:57.982
THAT ALLOWS FOR ON CONSISTENT

02:25:58.049 --> 02:25:58.549
OPPORTUNITY FOR HIRING. THE

02:25:58.616 --> 02:26:00.518
OTHER BIG PLACE THAT EMTS ARE

02:26:00.585 --> 02:26:02.453
GETTING HIRED INCREASINGLY IS IN

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:04.355
MODEL MODE RECEIVING CENTERS.

02:26:04.422 --> 02:26:06.657
AND IN SOBRE DETOX FACILITIES AS

02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:07.925
FRONT DOOR STAFF BASICALLY THINK

02:26:07.992 --> 02:26:10.394
OF LIKE A INTAKE. OR CHARGES

02:26:16.501 --> 02:26:19.604
THINK ABOUT. INCOME INEQUALITY-

02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:21.339
AND THE INVESTMENT THAT IS

02:26:21.405 --> 02:26:24.876
CLEARLY NEEDED BUT ALSO. LIVING

02:26:24.942 --> 02:26:26.878
WAGES MAKING EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:29.380

PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. JUST MAKES

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:37.755
IT ALMOST NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

02:26:37.822 --> 02:26:39.190
HAVE THAT LEVEL OF STRESS THE

02:26:39.257 --> 02:26:41.359
LEVEL OF JOB THE LEVEL OF

02:26:41.425 --> 02:26:43.461
RESPONSIBILITY. AT EIGHTEEN

02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:44.529
DOLLARS AN HOUR DOESN'T SEEM

02:26:44.595 --> 02:26:46.464
FAIR- AND IT CERTAINLY DOES

02:26:46.531 --> 02:26:48.466
SOMETHING FOR US TO THINK ABOUT

02:26:48.533 --> 02:26:49.400
IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT ACTUALLY

02:26:49.467 --> 02:26:52.069
LOOKS LIKE. FOR A WORK FORCE

RELIEF PROGRAM. I WOULD LIKE TO

03:12:36.878 --> 03:12:38.313
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH REVENUE THE

03:12:38.380 --> 03:12:40.916
STATE EXPECTS THE TAX WILL

03:12:40.982 --> 03:12:44.085
GENERATE BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND

03:12:44.152 --> 03:12:46.288
WHAT ARE THE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR

03:12:46.354 --> 03:12:48.924
US TO UPGRADE THE REMAINING TWO

03:12:48.990 --> 03:12:50.225
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE

03:12:50.292 --> 03:12:51.493
HOSPITAL BUILDINGS THAT WERE

03:12:51.559 --> 03:12:53.662
IDENTIFIED IN THE AGENDA. IN

03:12:53.728 --> 03:12:56.064
OTHER WORDS IS THERE A LARGE GAP

03:12:56.131 --> 03:12:58.400
IN FUNDING. THAT'S NEEDED TO

03:12:58.466 --> 03:13:00.335
ENSURE THAT ALL OF CALIFORNIA

03:13:00.402 --> 03:13:02.637
SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS WILL

03:13:02.704 --> 03:13:05.740
BE SEISMICALLY COMPLIANT. AND IF

03:13:05.807 --> 03:13:07.509
WE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT

03:13:07.575 --> 03:13:09.945
FUNDING. HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE

03:13:10.011 --> 03:13:11.513
THE LIMITED FUNDING FOR THIS

03:13:11.579 --> 03:13:16.985
PURPOSE IT'S- REGARDING THE- HOW

03:13:17.052 --> 03:13:19.421
MUCH REVENUE IS GOING TO BE

03:13:19.487 --> 03:13:21.489
HEADED TO THE- TO THE SMALL

03:13:21.556 --> 03:13:24.059
RURAL HOSPITAL RELIEF PROGRAM-

03:13:24.125 --> 03:13:26.161
THE PROJECTIONS ARE SHOWING THAT

03:13:26.227 --> 03:13:29.064
IT'S ABOUT- TWO MILLION DOLLARS

03:13:29.130 --> 03:13:31.032
A YEAR. FOR THE FIRST TWELVE

03:13:31.099 --> 03:13:34.803
MONTHS AND- THERE. IT'S SOLELY

03:13:34.869 --> 03:13:39.708
DRIVEN BY THE- THE TAX REVENUES

03:13:39.774 --> 03:13:41.843
COLLECTED ON THE SALES OF E.

03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:43.945
CIGARETTES SO- IT COULD BE

03:13:44.012 --> 03:13:46.014
VARIABLE BY THAT BUT THE

03:13:46.081 --> 03:13:46.948
PROJECTIONS ARE ABOUT TWO

03:13:47.015 --> 03:13:49.784
MILLION DOLLARS REGARDING THE-

03:13:49.851 --> 03:13:52.620
THAT THAT GAP IN TERMS OF- IS

03:13:52.687 --> 03:13:55.690
THERE A GAP BETWEEN. THE FUNDING

03:13:55.757 --> 03:13:57.092
AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM

03:13:57.158 --> 03:13:59.160
AND WHAT'S NEEDED I WOULD SAY

03:13:59.227 --> 03:14:00.996
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE IS A

03:14:01.062 --> 03:14:04.466
WIDE GAP- HOWEVER REGARDING- THE

03:14:04.532 --> 03:14:06.968
SEISMIC STATISTICS I'M GOING TO

03:14:07.035 --> 03:14:08.970
ASK THAT CARL SURE MEN JUMP IN

03:14:09.037 --> 03:14:13.274
HERE- WHO IS A- WORKS WITHIN

03:14:13.341 --> 03:14:15.010
FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT DIVISIONS

03:14:15.076 --> 03:14:18.713
SEISMIC COMPLIANCE UNIT TO

03:14:18.780 --> 03:14:19.681
ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION FOR THEIR-

03:14:19.748 --> 03:14:22.784
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- AND-

03:14:22.851 --> 03:14:24.719
CHAIR. ARAMBULA THANK YOU VERY

03:14:24.786 --> 03:14:26.888
MUCH FOR THE QUESTION R. TWO

03:14:26.955 --> 03:14:28.323
MILLION DOLLARS WHEN IT COMES

03:14:28.390 --> 03:14:30.458
TO- BUILDING IMPROVEMENT IS A

03:14:30.525 --> 03:14:32.861
VERY SMALL NUMBER- ESPECIALLY

03:14:32.927 --> 03:14:34.696
GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS

03:14:34.763 --> 03:14:37.899
THAT ARE IN NEED. SO AS WE LOOK

03:14:37.966 --> 03:14:40.301
AT SPENDING UP THE PROGRAM ARE

03:14:40.368 --> 03:14:41.036
AND KNOWING THAT WE HAVE VERY

03:14:41.102 --> 03:14:43.872
FEW DOLLARS- IT TO BEGIN WITH.

03:14:43.938 --> 03:14:45.974
WE'RE LOOKING AT- THE CONDITION

03:14:46.041 --> 03:14:48.009
OF THE BUILDINGS AND ATTEMPTING

03:14:48.076 --> 03:14:51.179
TO ESTIMATE THEIR- WITH THE BOND

03:14:51.246 --> 03:14:53.348
CAPITAL NECESSARY AND THE FACT

03:14:53.415 --> 03:14:55.016
IS THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE

03:14:55.083 --> 03:14:57.886
INFORMATION ON FILE NECESSARY TO

03:14:57.952 --> 03:14:59.454
TELL US WHAT THE CONDITION OF

03:14:59.521 --> 03:15:01.189
THESE BUILDINGS ARE. MOST OF

03:15:01.256 --> 03:15:02.924
THEM ACHEVED A. R. A. N. S. B.

03:15:02.991 --> 03:15:05.293
C. TO PERFORMANCE RATING THROUGH

03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:06.795
THE HOUSES PROCESS WHICH DOES

03:15:06.861 --> 03:15:08.263
NOT REQUIRE THAT THE BUILDINGS

03:15:08.329 --> 03:15:10.098
BE EVALUATED THEREFORE WE DON'T

03:15:10.165 --> 03:15:12.634
REALLY HAVE AN IDEA OF THEIR

03:15:12.700 --> 03:15:14.002
DEFICIENCY. TO MOVE THE PROGRAM

03:15:14.069 --> 03:15:15.804
FORWARD AND TO HELP ANSWER THE

03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:17.038
QUESTION THAT YOUPOSED AS WE'RE

03:15:17.105 --> 03:15:18.940
LOOKING AT THE INITIAL ROUND OF

03:15:19.007 --> 03:15:22.177
FUNDING AVAILABLE- WE ARE

03:15:22.243 --> 03:15:23.878
INTENDING TO LOOK CLOSELY AT

03:15:23.945 --> 03:15:25.413
THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAVE NOT

03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:27.482
DONE THEIR SEISMIC EVALUATIONS

03:15:27.549 --> 03:15:29.384
YET. IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING

03:15:29.451 --> 03:15:30.885
WITH THE BUILDINGS DEFICIENCIES

03:15:30.952 --> 03:15:32.887
ARE AND THOSE ARE RELATIVELY LOW

03:15:32.954 --> 03:15:36.591
COST- STUDIES WHERE WE CAN VERY

03:15:36.658 --> 03:15:38.693
QUICKLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:40.361
DEMAND IS ACROSS THE ENTIRE

03:15:40.428 --> 03:15:42.430
STATE FOR THIS CATEGORY OF

03:15:42.497 --> 03:15:44.199
FACILITY AND I WOULD HOPE THAT

03:15:44.265 --> 03:15:47.135
BABY BY- MIDDLE OF TWENTY TWENTY

03:15:47.202 --> 03:15:49.270
THREE. WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH

03:15:49.337 --> 03:15:54.676
BETTER ABILITY TO ESTIMATE THAT. AS OF TODAY WE DO NOT HAVE

03:15:54.742 --> 03:15:57.812
THAT. FOLLOWING UP ON THAT AND-

03:15:57.879 --> 03:15:58.847
SO IT SOUNDED LIKE YOUR

03:15:58.913 --> 03:16:01.416
PRIORITIZATION THEN WAS TO FOCUS

03:16:01.483 --> 03:16:04.219
ON THE HOSPITALS THAT CURRENTLY

03:16:04.285 --> 03:16:06.387
HAVE NOT DONE A SEISMIC

03:16:06.454 --> 03:16:08.790
EVALUATION IS THAT CORRECT BUT

03:16:08.857 --> 03:16:11.860
NOT ABOUT TO FIX ANY OF THE TWO

03:16:11.926 --> 03:16:13.194
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE

03:16:13.261 --> 03:16:14.529
BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:16:14.596 --> 03:16:16.164
IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING

03:16:16.231 --> 03:16:19.400
IMPROVEMENT. IT WOULD BE VERY

03:16:19.467 --> 03:16:22.504
EASY FOR ONE VERY BADLY DESIGNED

03:16:22.570 --> 03:16:25.473
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM TO ABSORB ALL

03:16:25.540 --> 03:16:27.475
OF THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. SO

03:16:27.542 --> 03:16:29.377
IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSURE RIGHT

03:16:29.444 --> 03:16:31.079
UP FRONT TO THAT THE MONEY IS

03:16:31.146 --> 03:16:33.014
BEING SPENT WISELY AND THAT'S

03:16:33.081 --> 03:16:34.849
WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT. PUTTING

03:16:34.916 --> 03:16:37.919
THE MONEY FIRST- I WILL PUT A

03:16:37.986 --> 03:16:40.455
PIN IN THIS CONVERSATION AND YET

03:16:40.522 --> 03:16:42.223
I BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE

03:16:42.290 --> 03:16:43.391
DISCUSSED WITH THE

03:16:43.458 --> 03:16:46.027
ADMINISTRATION. AS WE ARE HAVING

03:16:46.094 --> 03:16:46.828
A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT

03:16:46.895 --> 03:16:49.164

MEET THE ALL QUEST ACT AND

03:16:51.599 --> 03:16:53.902
ADDRESS THE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS

03:16:53.968 --> 03:16:55.036
IN OUR STATE. IS A VERY

03:16:55.103 --> 03:16:56.971
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR US TO

03:16:57.038 --> 03:16:58.540
HAVE AND JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

03:16:58.606 --> 03:17:00.842
THAT IT DOES NOT. APPEAR

03:17:00.909 --> 03:17:02.677
APPARENT BASED ON THE

03:17:02.744 --> 03:17:03.945
CONVERSATION TODAY THAT THE

03:17:04.012 --> 03:17:05.947

CALIFORNIA CAN LARGELY BE

03:38:50.417 --> 03:38:51.518
GROUPED INTO THREE MAJOR

03:40:51.504 --> 03:40:52.505
JOAQUIN VALLEY REGIONS HAVE

03:40:52.572 --> 03:40:54.107
RATIOS OF LICENSED BEHAVIOR

03:40:54.174 --> 03:40:54.841
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PER

03:40:54.908 --> 03:40:56.743
POPULATION THEY'RE SUBSTANTIALLY

03:40:56.810 --> 03:40:58.511
LOWER THAN THE STATE OVERALL.

03:40:58.578 --> 03:41:00.146
THE NORTHERN SYRIAN REGION HAVE

03:41:00.213 --> 03:41:01.281
SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER RATIOS OF

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE ALSO

03:41:08.955 --> 03:41:10.357
DOES NOT RELENT REFLECT THE

03:41:10.423 --> 03:41:12.158
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF

03:41:12.225 --> 03:41:13.460
THE STATE'S POPULATION THAT'S

03:41:13.526 --> 03:41:16.262
WHY IT'S SO HARD TO FIND A

03:41:16.329 --> 03:41:18.598
DIVERSE PROFESSIONALS. BLACK AND

03:41:18.665 --> 03:41:20.100

PSYCHOLOGISTS AND LATIN X. ARE

03:41:23.336 --> 03:41:24.771
ALSO UNDER REPRESENTED AMONG

03:41:30.477 --> 03:41:32.345
AMONG TYPE ALL TYPES OF BEHAVIOR

03:41:32.412 --> 03:41:33.513
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ACCEPT

03:41:33.580 --> 03:41:35.148
PSYCHIATRIST BUT EVEN AMONG

03:41:35.215 --> 03:41:36.916
PSYCHIATRISTS WHEN WE UNPACK

03:41:36.983 --> 03:41:39.452
ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER INTO

03:41:39.519 --> 03:41:41.755
SPECIFIC ETHNIC GROUPS THE

03:41:41.821 --> 03:41:43.023
COMPOSITION OF PSYCHIATRISTS

03:41:43.089 --> 03:41:45.025
DOESN'T REFLECT THE COMPOSITION

03:41:45.091 --> 03:41:47.193
OF POPULATION. WE ALSO DIVERSE

03:41:47.260 --> 03:41:47.961
OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:41:48.028 --> 03:41:49.029
PROFESSIONALS WHO SPEAK

03:41:49.095 --> 03:41:51.197
LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND

03:41:51.264 --> 03:41:52.666
THE LACK OF SPANISH SPEAKERS IS

03:41:52.732 --> 03:41:54.634
ESPECIALLY SEVERE AMONG

03:41:54.701 --> 03:41:56.469
PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS

03:41:56.536 --> 03:41:57.804
. SO HAVING OUTLINED THESE

03:41:57.871 --> 03:41:59.539
CHALLENGES WE FACE I'D NOW LIKE

03:41:59.606 --> 03:42:02.075
TO LEARN TO POSSIBLE TO TURN TWO

03:42:02.142 --> 03:42:04.577
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND I THINK

03:42:04.644 --> 03:42:05.879
FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED A

03:42:05.945 --> 03:42:07.414
COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO

03:42:07.480 --> 03:42:08.848
ADDRESS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:42:08.915 --> 03:42:10.784
WORKFORCE NEEDS ARE A LOT OF.

03:42:10.850 --> 03:42:12.052
INITIATIVES OUT THERE THAT HOLD

03:42:12.118 --> 03:42:14.187
A LOT OF PROMISE BUT IT'S NOT

03:42:14.254 --> 03:42:15.255
ALWAYS CLEAR HOW THEY FIT

03:42:15.321 --> 03:42:17.223
TOGETHER. THANK KEY COMPONENTS I

03:42:17.290 --> 03:42:18.858
THINK OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

03:42:18.925 --> 03:42:20.193
INCLUDE PROMOTING BEHAVIORAL

03:42:20.260 --> 03:42:22.228
HEALTH CAREERS DEVELOPING THE

03:42:22.295 --> 03:42:23.463
PIPELINE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:42:23.530 --> 03:42:25.131
WORKERS AND IMPROVING GEOGRAPHIC

03:42:25.198 --> 03:42:27.667
DISTRIBUTION. I THINK PROTECT

03:42:27.734 --> 03:42:29.002
AROUND PROMOTING BEHAVIORAL

03:42:29.069 --> 03:42:30.103
HEALTH CHRIS MANY CREATIVE

03:42:30.170 --> 03:42:32.539
APPROACHES TO WASTE AWARENESS OF

03:42:32.605 --> 03:42:34.274
BEHAVIORAL CAREERS AMONG

03:42:34.340 --> 03:42:35.775
RACIALLY ETHNICALLY AND

03:42:35.842 --> 03:42:36.676
LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE YOUNG

03:42:36.743 --> 03:42:39.245
PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT

03:42:39.312 --> 03:42:41.347
LGBTQ PERSONS WHO WANT TO STICK

03:42:41.414 --> 03:42:43.149
TO INTERNEES PROFESSIONS. ARE

03:42:43.216 --> 03:42:45.085
UNLIKELY EMPTIES WE ALSO NEED

03:42:45.151 --> 03:42:46.720
MORE MEN HERE THE KEY

03:42:46.786 --> 03:42:48.555
DIFFERENCES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:42:48.621 --> 03:42:49.389
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

03:42:49.456 --> 03:42:51.624
PSYCHIATRISTS THESE OCCUPATIONS

03:42:51.691 --> 03:42:53.259
ARE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE SO WE

03:42:53.326 --> 03:42:54.961
KNEW WE NEED TO THINK OF HOW DO

03:42:55.028 --> 03:42:56.229
WE GET MORE MEN PARTICULARLY

03:42:56.296 --> 03:42:59.466
YOUNG MEN. INTO THESE

03:42:59.532 --> 03:43:00.533
PROFESSIONS TO SERVE PEOPLE IN

03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:02.235
NEED. HI POINT DEVELOPMENT XIN

03:43:02.302 --> 03:43:04.037
COMPASS BOTH INCREASING NUMBERS

03:43:04.104 --> 03:43:05.572
OF GRADUATES OF EDUCATIONAL

03:43:05.638 --> 03:43:07.607
PROGRAMS AND THE DIVERSITY OF

03:43:07.674 --> 03:43:09.976
GRADUATES. AND SO KAREN RIZZO

03:43:10.043 --> 03:43:11.678
HAS TALKED ABOUT EACH CASE

03:43:11.745 --> 03:43:14.314
EXISTING PROGRAMS FOR EXPANDING

03:43:14.380 --> 03:43:16.282
CAPACITY TO TRAIN BEHAVIORAL

03:43:16.349 --> 03:43:17.150
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS INTO SOME

03:43:17.217 --> 03:43:20.787
MODELS- THAT CAN BE EASILY BUILT

03:43:20.854 --> 03:43:21.988
ON THERE- I WOULD SAY WE OUGHT

03:43:22.055 --> 03:43:23.790
TO TAKE PAGE FROM THE SONG BROWN

03:43:23.857 --> 03:43:27.093
PROGRAM. AND AWARD INCLUDE

03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:29.062
CRITERIA FOR AWARDING FUNDING

03:43:29.129 --> 03:43:30.530
THAT PRIOR TORIES AREAS OF THE

03:43:30.597 --> 03:43:32.065
STATE WITH THE GREATEST NEED FOR

03:43:32.132 --> 03:43:33.767
BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.

03:43:33.833 --> 03:43:35.969
AND ALSO I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO

03:43:36.035 --> 03:43:37.804
LOOK AT PRIVATIZING ACCELERATED

03:43:37.871 --> 03:43:39.005
PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONES THAT WAS

03:43:39.072 --> 03:43:40.807
WITH LANCE BYRD. MENTIONED

03:43:40.874 --> 03:43:41.908
BECAUSE THEY ENABLE US TO GET

03:43:41.975 --> 03:43:45.211
FOLKS INTO LICENSED PROFESSIONS

03:43:45.278 --> 03:43:46.746
MORE QUICKLY- CRITICAL THAT

03:43:46.813 --> 03:43:48.381
EXPANSION TRAINING SLOTS BE

03:43:48.448 --> 03:43:49.215
ACCOMPANIED BY FINANCIAL

03:43:49.282 --> 03:43:51.818
ASSISTANCE. FOR STUDENTS I THINK

03:43:51.885 --> 03:43:53.286
A GOOD EXAMPLE WAS THE STIPEND

03:43:53.353 --> 03:43:54.988
PROGRAM FOR MASTER'S OF SOCIAL

03:43:55.054 --> 03:43:57.223
WORK STUDENTS THAT H. CHI-

03:43:57.290 --> 03:43:58.558
PREVIOUSLY OPERATED UNDER THE

03:43:58.625 --> 03:43:59.926
AUSPICES OF THE MENTAL MENTAL

03:43:59.993 --> 03:44:01.761
HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND THAT

03:44:01.828 --> 03:44:03.096
PROGRAM HAD PAID BACK

03:44:03.163 --> 03:44:04.464
REQUIREMENT UNDER WHICH PEOPLE

03:44:04.531 --> 03:44:06.432
WHO RECEIVED A STIPEND MUST WORK

03:44:06.499 --> 03:44:07.634
IN THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:44:07.700 --> 03:44:08.935
SYSTEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS

03:44:09.002 --> 03:44:10.470
FOLLOWING GRADUATION. AS WELL AS

03:44:10.537 --> 03:44:12.705
THE CURRICULUM TO RENT THEM TO

03:44:12.772 --> 03:44:14.707
THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE SERVED BY.

03:44:14.774 --> 03:44:18.044
THE PUBLIC SYSTEM- SOME YOU KNOW

03:44:18.111 --> 03:44:19.846
SOME FUNDING FOR THAT HAS GONE

03:44:19.913 --> 03:44:21.781
OUT TO THE REGION'S UNDER WET

03:44:21.848 --> 03:44:22.982
BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

03:44:23.049 --> 03:44:25.451
VALUE PERHAPS TO RE. RE

03:44:25.518 --> 03:44:27.086
CENTRALIZING AND REFOCUSING-

03:44:27.153 --> 03:44:28.521
ELIZABETH LANSFORD MENTIONED

03:44:28.588 --> 03:44:30.256
STIPENDS AND SCHOLARSHIPS

03:44:30.323 --> 03:44:32.725
REALLY- IMPORTANT CAN HURT THESE

03:44:32.792 --> 03:44:34.294
ARE OCCUPATIONS IN WHICH FOLKS

03:44:34.360 --> 03:44:36.396
JUST DON'T MAKE ENOUGH EVEN AT

03:44:36.462 --> 03:44:38.198
THE MASTER'S LEVEL. EASILY PAID

03:44:38.264 --> 03:44:39.599
LOANS AND CERTAINLY PRIORITY

03:44:39.666 --> 03:44:41.034
SHOULD BE GIVEN TO STUDENTS

03:44:41.100 --> 03:44:42.235
WHOSE BACKGROUNDS REFLECTING THE

03:44:42.302 --> 03:44:43.603
DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIANS WITH

03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:45.505
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. I'M

03:44:45.572 --> 03:44:46.940
SPENDING ABOUT TALKS SO MUCH

03:44:47.006 --> 03:44:48.708
ABOUT TODAY IS CAREER LADDER AND

03:44:48.775 --> 03:44:52.846
I GUESS IT'S CRITICALLY.

03:44:52.912 --> 03:44:54.147
IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF PIPELINE

03:44:54.214 --> 03:44:54.714
DEVELOPMENT. MAKING ENTERED

03:44:54.781 --> 03:44:56.749
HEALTH AND INTRIGUED OCCUPATIONS

03:44:56.816 --> 03:44:58.151
AS HMAN SERVICES ASSISTANCE

03:44:58.218 --> 03:45:00.086
CARE PROVIDERS OR SUBSTANCE USE.

03:45:00.153 --> 03:45:02.488
DISORDER COUNSELORS. AND ENTER

03:45:02.555 --> 03:45:04.991
THESE OCCUPATIONS HAS OFTEN BEEN

03:45:05.058 --> 03:45:07.193
HIGH- FOR THE REASONS THAT RANK

03:45:07.260 --> 03:45:08.561
WAS JUST TALKED ABOUT THE PEOPLE

03:45:08.628 --> 03:45:09.762
SPIRITS BURNOUT AND CONFINED

03:45:09.829 --> 03:45:12.966
LESS STRESSFUL JOBS IN OTHER-SECTORS THAT PAY SIMILAR WAGES.

03:45:13.032 --> 03:45:14.400
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SEE A

03:45:14.467 --> 03:45:16.302
CLEAR PATHWAY HOW THEY CAN HOW

03:45:16.369 --> 03:45:20.406
THEY CAN ADVANCE. TO A BETTER

03:45:20.473 --> 03:45:23.343
WAGE- AND MORE RESPONSIBLE

03:45:23.409 --> 03:45:25.478
POSITION IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

03:45:25.545 --> 03:45:26.880
AND SO I THINK WE CAN TAKE A

03:45:26.946 --> 03:45:28.948
PAGE FROM SOME WORK THAT THE

03:45:29.015 --> 03:45:29.515
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

03:45:29.582 --> 03:45:31.217

LEVEL OCCUPATIONS TO ADVANCE AND

03:45:38.024 --> 03:45:39.192
I THINK THIS MAPPING SHOULD BE

03:45:39.259 --> 03:45:41.361
LEVERAGED TO DEVELOP MORE FORMAL

03:45:41.427 --> 03:45:42.262
PARTNERSHIPS AMONG EDUCATIONAL

03:45:42.328 --> 03:45:44.464
INSTITUTIONS AND EMPLOYERS. TO

INCUMBENT WORKERS IN THE

03:45:47.934 --> 03:45:49.669
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND

03:45:49.736 --> 03:45:51.971

CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT THE

03:45:56.075 --> 03:45:57.176
ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL

03:45:57.243 --> 03:45:58.645

04:01:57.336 --> 04:01:59.171
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS IT CAN

SORT OF. COMMITTED OR ENCUMBERED

04:02:02.608 --> 04:02:04.543
FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE BUT FOR

WHICH YOU KNOW FUNDING HASN'T

04:02:05.811 --> 04:02:07.412

NOT ENCUMBERED AT ALL FOR. FOR

04:02:15.454 --> 04:02:18.023
ANY PURPOSE- AND SO WHILE WE

04:02:18.090 --> 04:02:21.493
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME

04:02:21.560 --> 04:02:22.628
DATA AVAILABLE THAT. SEVERAL

04:02:22.694 --> 04:02:24.429

UNENCUMBERED SHARE OF THIS TYPE

OF INFORMATION WOULD BE

04:02:41.580 --> 04:02:43.148
NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A SORT OF

THE MHSAA REVERSION POLICY AND

04:04:21.513 --> 04:04:23.181

ONE THING I SHOULD KNOW IS THAT

04:04:40.032 --> 04:04:41.033
WE'RE ALL MANAGING THIS IN OUR

04:04:41.099 --> 04:04:43.502
OWN WAY AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

04:04:43.568 --> 04:04:44.169
WE'RE SUCCESSFULLY DOING THAT IN

04:04:44.236 --> 04:04:46.138
THAT- LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF

04:04:46.204 --> 04:04:47.906
OUR IMAGE AS A FUNDS. ARE

04:04:47.973 --> 04:04:50.375
REVERTED SO- WE JUST MENTIONED

04:04:50.442 --> 04:04:52.444
ARE THERE IS A REVERSION POLICY

04:04:52.511 --> 04:04:54.613
AND SO WE'RE ALL MANAGING TO

04:04:54.679 --> 04:04:57.382
MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WE AVOID

04:04:57.449 --> 04:04:59.651
THAT REPRESENT. HAVING HELPED.

04:04:59.718 --> 04:05:01.887
IF I COULD ADD I'M NOT SURE THAT

04:05:01.953 --> 04:05:05.157
DATA POINT IS. GOING TO SUFFICE

04:05:05.223 --> 04:05:07.426
THE CURIOSITY WE HAVE WITHIN THE

04:05:07.492 --> 04:05:08.827
LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THE

04:05:08.894 --> 04:05:10.195
DOLLARS. ARE BEING SENT

04:05:10.262 --> 04:05:11.496
EFFECTIVELY JUST BECAUSE YOU

04:05:11.563 --> 04:05:12.631
HAVEN'T REVERTED ON DOESN'T

04:05:12.697 --> 04:05:14.599
MEAN. WE DON'T HAVE THE

04:05:14.666 --> 04:05:17.669
OVERSIGHT THAT IS NECESSARY TO

04:05:17.736 --> 04:05:20.138
ENSURE. THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT

04:05:20.205 --> 04:05:22.140
IS NEEDED WITH THESE DOLLARS AND

04:05:22.207 --> 04:05:25.077
I WOULD JUST POINT TO HISTORY.

04:05:25.143 --> 04:05:27.913
AND THE AUDIT RESULTS TO FIND

04:05:27.979 --> 04:05:29.915
THE IMPETUS FOR US TO BE ASKING

04:05:29.981 --> 04:05:31.716
THE NATURE OF OUR QUESTIONS AND

04:05:31.783 --> 04:05:33.351
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

04:05:33.418 --> 04:05:35.554
OUR COUNTIES AND ENSURING THAT

04:05:35.620 --> 04:05:37.055
THOSE PROP SIXTY THREE RESERVES

04:05:37.122 --> 04:05:38.824
ARE AT THE PRUDENT RESERVES

04:05:38.890 --> 04:05:40.625
LEVEL THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT. BUT

04:05:40.692 --> 04:05:45.730
IT'S IN. BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE

04:05:45.797 --> 04:05:47.499
MIDST OF THE CRISIS AND WE NEED

04:05:47.566 --> 04:05:49.401
TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS AS SOON

04:05:49.468 --> 04:05:51.403
AS POSSIBLE IF WE CAN'T. AND I

04:05:51.470 --> 04:05:54.072
BELIEVE THAT WHAT WERE IN IN THE

04:05:54.139 --> 04:05:57.008
MOMENT IS. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

04:05:57.075 --> 04:05:59.111
TOP EARNERS DO QUITE WELL AND

04:05:59.177 --> 04:06:01.279
DUE TO THE NATURE OF MHSAA

04:06:01.346 --> 04:06:03.915
COLLECTING ON THOSE TOP EARNERS

04:06:03.982 --> 04:06:05.484
WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:07.152
IN REVENUES AND- REALLY WOULD

04:06:07.219 --> 04:06:09.421
LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COUNTIES

04:06:09.488 --> 04:06:11.089
ARE SITTING ON HOW WE CAN

04:06:11.156 --> 04:06:13.258
INCENTIVIZE THOSE COUNTIES. TO

04:06:13.325 --> 04:06:15.026
BE SPENDING EFFECTIVELY INTO

04:06:15.093 --> 04:06:18.029
WORK FORCE AND- WILL BE

04:06:18.096 --> 04:06:20.265
FOLLOWING UP WITH QUESTIONS BUT

04:06:20.332 --> 04:06:22.501
I BUT I DO WANT TO. DIG INTO

04:06:22.567 --> 04:06:24.202
SOMETHING BECAUSE I ACTUALLY

04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:26.271
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WHEN

04:06:26.338 --> 04:06:28.406
WE CREATED THE MENTAL HEALTH

04:06:28.473 --> 04:06:30.075
SERVICES ACT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

04:06:30.142 --> 04:06:32.677
SAME UNDERSTANDING OF MENTAL

04:06:32.744 --> 04:06:34.279
HEALTH THAT WE DO NOW. IN

04:06:34.346 --> 04:06:36.214
CALLING IT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND

04:06:36.281 --> 04:06:37.949
THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN MENTAL

04:06:38.016 --> 04:06:39.017
HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE

04:06:39.084 --> 04:06:41.319
DISORDERS. THAT I'D LIKE TO

04:06:41.386 --> 04:06:44.489
UNDERSTAND- AND MAKE SURE I'M

04:06:44.556 --> 04:06:46.591
CLARIFYING THAT CURRENTLY THE

04:06:46.658 --> 04:06:48.360
WHAT FUNDING WE'VE BEEN DOING

04:06:48.426 --> 04:06:51.062
THE FIVE YEAR PLANS DO NOT APPLY

04:06:51.129 --> 04:06:53.965
TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AND

04:06:54.032 --> 04:06:56.067
WHETHER OR NOT. ANY OF OUR-

04:06:56.134 --> 04:06:57.402
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES

04:06:57.469 --> 04:06:59.571
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A MISSING

04:06:59.638 --> 04:07:02.874
LINK AND AN AREA WHERE WE NEED

04:07:02.941 --> 04:07:08.980

WE TALKED ABOUT THE M. TEES. IT

04:22:28.899 --> 04:22:30.301
IS AN ENTRY POINT INTO THE

04:22:30.367 --> 04:22:32.536
ALLIED HEALTH CARE FIELD. BUT

04:22:32.603 --> 04:22:34.171
UNLIKE OTHER ALLIED HEALTH CARE

04:22:34.238 --> 04:22:36.340
FIELD TRAINING PROGRAMS IT

04:22:36.407 --> 04:22:39.143
REQUIRES THAT THE DO YOU HAVE A

04:22:39.210 --> 04:22:40.177
DIRECTR THAT IS A REGISTERED

04:22:44.215 --> 04:22:45.249
EXPERIENCE WORKING IN LONG TERM

04:22:45.316 --> 04:22:47.017
CARE FIELD AND ONE YEAR OF

04:22:47.084 --> 04:22:48.853
EXPERIENCE TEACHING ADULTS. IT

04:22:48.919 --> 04:22:52.656
ALSO REQUIRES THAT YOU FOR THE

04:22:52.723 --> 04:22:53.858
INSTRUCTOR YOU HAVE AN LPN.

04:22:53.924 --> 04:22:56.193
UNLIKE OTHER PROGRAMS SAY AN EMT

04:22:56.260 --> 04:22:58.629
A SURGE TECH DENTAL ASSISTANCE

04:22:58.696 --> 04:23:00.831
WHICH CAN BE LED AND INSTRUCTED

04:23:00.898 --> 04:23:03.434
BY A COLLEAGUE. AT WE'VE ALREADY

04:23:03.501 --> 04:23:06.070
HEARD HOW SHORT STAFF NURSES ARE

04:23:06.137 --> 04:23:07.738
IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE

04:23:07.805 --> 04:23:09.940
COUNTRY. AND THIS REQUIREMENT AT

04:23:10.007 --> 04:23:12.309
IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE IT OUR AND

04:23:12.376 --> 04:23:14.345
LEADING A CNA TRAINING PROGRAM

04:23:14.411 --> 04:23:15.980
WHO MAY THEMSELVES HAVE NEVER

04:23:16.046 --> 04:23:18.682
WORKED AS A CNA. AS OPPOSED TO

04:23:18.749 --> 04:23:20.918
SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE IT FOR

04:23:20.985 --> 04:23:23.020
THREE FIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS.

04:23:23.087 --> 04:23:24.188
IS REALLY WHAT MAKES THIS

04:23:24.255 --> 04:23:26.123
PROGRAM VERY CHALLENGING OUT WE

04:23:26.190 --> 04:23:27.858
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HIRE A

04:23:27.925 --> 04:23:28.959
PROGRAM DIRECTOR THAT MEETS

04:23:29.026 --> 04:23:31.095
THESE RIGID REQUIREMENTS. AND IT

04:23:31.162 --> 04:23:32.763
IS TRULY TO OUR DETRIMENT

04:23:32.830 --> 04:23:34.698
BECAUSE MANY C. N. A.'S WHO

04:23:34.765 --> 04:23:37.134
WORKED IN THE FIELD FOR. DECADES

04:23:37.201 --> 04:23:38.335
WOULD ACTUALLY BE GREAT IN THIS

04:23:38.402 --> 04:23:40.905
ROLE. AND AT DR RAM TO THE TO

04:23:40.971 --> 04:23:42.540
YOUR EARLIER POINT AROUND EQUITY

04:23:42.606 --> 04:23:45.276
AND INCLUSION- THIS IS WHAT IS

04:23:45.342 --> 04:23:47.278
THE UNDERVALUING OF PARTICULARLY

04:23:47.344 --> 04:23:49.079
WOMEN. PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF

04:23:49.146 --> 04:23:51.282
COLOR AND THEIR LONG EXPERIENCE

04:23:51.348 --> 04:23:53.250
IN THE SECTOR WE NEED NEW

04:23:53.317 --> 04:23:55.085
CREATING MORE PATHWAYS AND

04:23:55.152 --> 04:23:57.288
SOMETIMES OUR RESTRICTIONS. ARE

04:23:57.354 --> 04:23:58.856
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

04:23:58.923 --> 04:24:00.057
LAUNCH PROGRAMS OF WHAT NEEDS TO

04:24:00.124 --> 04:24:02.493
BE. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE BEAUTY

04:24:02.560 --> 04:24:04.695
OF OUR PROGRAM WAS THAT FIVE

04:24:04.762 --> 04:24:05.963
SITES COULD SHARE ONE PROGRAM

04:24:06.030 --> 04:24:07.731
DIRECTOR THEREFORE IT COST

04:24:07.798 --> 04:24:09.967
SAVINGS- BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER

04:24:10.034 --> 04:24:11.802
IF WE CAN ACTUALLY GET IN OUR

04:24:11.869 --> 04:24:13.037
AND BECAUSE THERE ARE SO RIGHT

04:24:13.103 --> 04:24:16.240
RT. IN A DESPERATE SHORT SUPPLY.

04:24:16.307 --> 04:24:17.775
ADDITIONALLY SIMPLY BECAUSE

04:24:17.841 --> 04:24:19.610
SOMEONE OF THE TREMENDOUS RN

04:24:19.677 --> 04:24:21.679
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

04:24:21.745 --> 04:24:22.880
THEY ARE STEEPED IN ADULT

04:24:22.947 --> 04:24:24.481
LEARNING PRINCIPLES.

04:24:24.548 --> 04:24:26.217
PARTICULARLY WORKING WITH

04:24:26.283 --> 04:24:27.985
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND

04:24:28.052 --> 04:24:29.453
COMMITTING TO A RESTORATIVE

04:24:29.520 --> 04:24:31.722
JUSTICE FRAMEWORK. SO WHEN WE

04:24:31.789 --> 04:24:33.591
SAY WE NEED TO PROGRAM DIRECTOR

04:24:33.657 --> 04:24:34.658
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WRITING

04:24:34.725 --> 04:24:38.195
TO SANTA AND ASKING FOR A

04:24:38.262 --> 04:24:39.163
CHRISTMAS GIFT EARLY-

04:24:39.230 --> 04:24:41.131
ADDITIONALLY. OUT WE HAVE HAD

04:24:41.198 --> 04:24:42.900
HEARD MANY THINGS TODAY ABOUT

04:24:42.967 --> 04:24:44.568
THE PROGRAMS IN SKILLED NURSING

04:24:44.635 --> 04:24:46.203
FACILITIES AND ACROSS THE HEALTH

04:24:46.270 --> 04:24:48.239
CARE SECTOR. AND I WANT TO

04:24:48.305 --> 04:24:49.807
REALLY HIGHLIGHT TO YOU THAT THE

04:24:49.873 --> 04:24:51.175
WHITE HOUSE RECENTLY MADE AN

04:24:51.242 --> 04:24:52.142
ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE STATE THE

04:24:52.209 --> 04:24:54.211
UNION THAT THEY ARE INVESTING IN

04:24:54.278 --> 04:24:56.046
SKILLED NURSING IMPROVEMENTS AND

04:24:56.113 --> 04:24:58.048
ARE DIRECTING- THE HEALTH HUMAN

04:24:58.115 --> 04:24:59.650
SERVICES AND CENTER FOR MEDICARE

04:24:59.717 --> 04:25:01.719
AND MEDICAID SERVICES. TO

04:25:01.785 --> 04:25:02.453
UNDERTAKE SEVERAL KEY

04:25:02.519 --> 04:25:04.455
INITIATIVES. ONE OF THOSE

04:25:04.521 --> 04:25:07.791
ENSURING ADEQUATE PAY. ALL OF

04:25:07.858 --> 04:25:09.593
THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE TALKED

04:25:09.660 --> 04:25:11.729
ABOUT OUR GREAT AND LOVELY. BUT

04:25:11.795 --> 04:25:15.532
IF WE DO NOT RAISE THE WAGES FOR

04:25:15.599 --> 04:25:17.601
CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS AND

04:25:17.668 --> 04:25:19.036
THOSE WORKING IN THE LONG TERM

04:25:19.103 --> 04:25:22.172
CARE SECTOR. WE WILL NOT SEE THE

04:25:22.239 --> 04:25:23.674
INCREASE IN RECRUITMENT AND

04:25:23.741 --> 04:25:25.042
RETENTION THAT WE ALL

04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:27.511
DESPERATELY DESIRE. ACCORDING TO

04:25:27.578 --> 04:25:30.247
SOME RECENT- BUT THAT WORK DONE

04:25:30.314 --> 04:25:31.915
OUT OF UCS AFTER CHARLENE

04:25:31.982 --> 04:25:33.751
HARRINGTON IT SAYS THAT OPIS

04:25:33.817 --> 04:25:35.052
TURNOVER IN SKILLED NURSING

04:25:35.119 --> 04:25:36.553
FACILITIES IS ROUGHLY A HUNDRED

04:25:36.620 --> 04:25:38.822
AND 20% ANNUALLY. THAT IS

04:25:38.889 --> 04:25:40.391
UNACCEPTABLE AND THAT CREATES

04:25:40.457 --> 04:25:41.992
TREMENDOUS CHANGES FOR THE

04:25:42.059 --> 04:25:43.327
RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THESE

04:25:43.394 --> 04:25:45.562
FACILITIES. AND SO I'M HERE

04:25:45.629 --> 04:25:47.665
TODAY TO UPDATE YOU ABOUT OUR

04:25:47.731 --> 04:25:49.266
PROGRAM BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE FOR

04:25:49.333 --> 04:25:51.168
YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TO

04:25:51.235 --> 04:25:52.403
FINALLY GAIN DEEPER

04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:53.971
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE

04:25:54.038 --> 04:25:56.140
REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS. IN OUR

04:25:56.206 --> 04:25:58.309
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. IF

04:25:58.375 --> 04:26:00.377
WE CANNOT PAY OR CARE GIVERS

04:26:00.444 --> 04:26:03.147
MORE WE WILL NOT KEEP THEM AND

04:26:03.213 --> 04:26:04.415
WE WILL KEEP SEEING THESE

04:26:04.481 --> 04:26:05.482
TERRIBLE INCIDENTS IS THAT WE'VE

04:26:05.549 --> 04:26:07.651
SEEN THROUGHOUT COBIT. AND SO I

04:26:07.718 --> 04:26:09.386
ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT IN TWO

04:26:09.453 --> 04:26:11.388
WAYS FIRST OF ALL. WHAT IS THE

04:26:11.455 --> 04:26:12.956
CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND

04:26:13.023 --> 04:26:14.825
DOESN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF THE

04:26:14.892 --> 04:26:16.627
PROVIDERS. AND SECONDLY WHAT IS

04:26:16.694 --> 04:26:18.696
BEEN THE ROLE OF PRIVATE PRIVATE

04:26:18.762 --> 04:26:21.265
