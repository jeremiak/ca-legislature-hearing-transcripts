00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:11.324 region:rollup2
THE.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.759 region:rollup2
THOMAS FIRE BURNED OVER TWO

AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAD TO.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:29.476 region:rollup2
A LIVE WITHIN THAT IT WAS REALLY

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:31.278 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC I THINK

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:33.280 region:rollup2
NATURAL DISASTERS ONE CAN

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:35.048 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN OF COURSE. OUR

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.483 region:rollup2
FIRST RESPONDERS.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.051 region:rollup2

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:38.618 region:rollup2
NONETHELESS WE STILL LOST OVER

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.754 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STRUCTURES IN THAT

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:45.826 region:rollup2
AREA.

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:47.394 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS A BEFORE. THE RAIN

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:49.096 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE IN THEIR MIND A SIDO

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:51.498 region:rollup2
UM WHICH ACTUALLY OCCURRED THREE

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:53.467 region:rollup2
DAYS BEFORE THE THOMAS FAR WAS

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:56.103 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY EVEN FULLY CONTAINED

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:58.605 region:rollup2
THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. NATURE

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:58.939 region:rollup2
IS NOT BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH US

00:03:58.605 --> 00:03:59.639 region:rollup2
RECENTLY AND.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.841 region:rollup2
.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.175 region:rollup2
WE GOT INFECTED MONASHEE DOVE

RAIN IN FIVE MINUTES.

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.649 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT PRECIPITATED THESE

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:09.816 region:rollup2
MUD SLIDES.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.551 region:rollup2

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:14.054 region:rollup2
.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:15.956 region:rollup2
CREATED. A RIVER OF MUD IN

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.691 region:rollup2
BOULDERS AND DEBRIS USE THAT I

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:19.659 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SEEN.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:21.695 region:rollup2
BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.863 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY KILLED AN ADDITIONAL

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:24.931 region:rollup2

AND UNFORTUNATELY.

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:43.183 region:rollup2
THIS DOES NOT THIS YEAR DOES

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:44.951 region:rollup2
NOT APPEAR TO BE AN ABNORMALITY.

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:46.953 region:rollup2
TO THE CONTRARY MOST OF OUR

CLEARLY CHANGING CLIMATE

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.399 region:rollup2
PATTERNS HAVE MADE OUR STATE

00:04:57.164 --> 00:05:02.769 region:rollup2
MORE VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRES

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:04.504 region:rollup2
WITH MASSIVE TREE DIOXIN INSECT

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:05.472 region:rollup2

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:13.780 region:rollup2
ALL OF COMBINED TO CREATE SEVERE

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:16.082 region:rollup2
FIRE RISKS POWER THROUGHOUT.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.417 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIAN DEED WE ARE A SPEND

FIRES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE SO.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:31.665 region:rollup2
.

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:34.634 region:rollup2
THAT ALONE SHOULD GIVE US

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:37.270 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. THE AND GIVE US PAUSE

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:39.506 region:rollup2
FOR A WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.208 region:rollup2

ABOVE NORMAL LARGE FIRE

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.616 region:rollup2

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:51.351 region:rollup2
THE PERSISTENCE OF THOSE DRY

GENERALLY UNFAVORABLE WEATHER

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:59.426 region:rollup2
THAT IS BEING PREDICTED SO THIS

00:05:57.123 --> 00:06:01.194 region:rollup2
NEW NORMAL. OF YEAR ROUND SEVERE

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:02.996 region:rollup2
FIRE RISK HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:04.764 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:06.900 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S HOMEOWNERS WILL BE

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:08.335 region:rollup2
ABLE TO FIND. AFFORDABLE

THE FUTURE.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:13.707 region:rollup2
AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.275 region:rollup2
HOWEVER ALL INDICATORS SUGGEST

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:18.044 region:rollup2
THAT THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:21.748 region:rollup2
FUNCTION WELL IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.450 region:rollup2
THAT IS AT LEAST THE IMMEDIATE

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:25.185 region:rollup2
GOOD NEWS. AND WHILE SOME

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.987 region:rollup2

00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:10.269 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE INSURER OFLAST

00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:12.171 region:rollup2
RESORT. THAT OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN

00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:14.006 region:rollup2
ON ALL THREE BUT PRINCIPALLY BY

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:15.674 region:rollup2
THE AVAILABILITY OF THE

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:16.875 region:rollup2
INSURANCE FROM THE ADMITTED

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:18.410 region:rollup2
MARKET IN THE COMMON THEME OF

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.711 region:rollup2
THESE COMMUNICATIONS WHETHER

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.046 region:rollup2
IT'S COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:22.681 region:rollup2
ARE LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:23.515 region:rollup2
RATHER STAKEHOLDERS. IS THAT IT

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:25.551 region:rollup2
IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY

00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:26.985 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADMITTED

00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:29.021 region:rollup2
KOMMER ADMITTED RESIDENTIAL CARE

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:32.524 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN THESE AREAS.

00:26:29.021 --> 00:26:34.092 region:rollup2
AND PRICES ARE GOING UP AS WELL

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:34.293 region:rollup2
SO LET'S GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE.

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:36.462 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:37.129 region:rollup2
WE GO UP TO THE NEXT ONE AFTER

00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:38.697 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THERE WE GO HERE IT IS.

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:41.033 region:rollup2
IT'S COMING.

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:43.101 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE FINDINGS IN OUR

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:44.736 region:rollup2
REPORT I IT WAS TO LOOK AT THE

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:45.771 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF NINE RENEWABLES

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:47.106 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE COMPLAINT

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:48.907 region:rollup2
WE WERE GETTING FROM SOME PEOPLE

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:50.342 region:rollup2
WAS I HAD INSURANCE WITH ENSURE

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:51.510 region:rollup2
ACTS. AND THE NEXT YEAR THEY

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:53.512 region:rollup2
DIDN'T RENEW ME.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.746 region:rollup2
SO SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THE

00:26:53.512 --> 00:26:56.281 region:rollup2
YEARS TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:57.883 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN WHICH WERE THE LATEST

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:59.351 region:rollup2
YEARS FOR WHICH WE HAD DATA. A

00:26:57.883 --> 00:27:00.986 region:rollup2
LOT THERE WAS A FIFTEEN PERCENT

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:04.456 region:rollup2
INCREASE

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:05.991 region:rollup2
IN NON RENEWALS IN THE WILDLAND

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:07.826 region:rollup2
URBAN INTERFACE COUNTIES THAT

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:10.095 region:rollup2
WAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OFHIGH

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:11.930 region:rollup2
IN VERY HIGH. A RISK

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:13.699 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S IT THE

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.134 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT A FIGURE TO KEEP IN

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:17.269 region:rollup2
MIND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL

00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:19.371 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT. I COULDN'T FIND

00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:21.006 region:rollup2
INSURANCE A BUT IT DOES MEAN

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:22.541 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR CURRENT CARRIER SAID

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:24.543 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT RENEWING YOU YOU'VE

00:27:22.541 --> 00:27:25.878 region:rollup2
GOT TO GO LOOK SOME PEOPLE FOUND

00:27:24.543 --> 00:27:27.479 region:rollup2
ADMITTED CARRIER INSURANCE SOME

00:27:25.878 --> 00:27:28.580 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WANT THE SURPLUS LINES

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.948 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE. WENT TO THE FAIR

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.950 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:33.385 region:rollup2
NOW LET ME JUST PAUSE A MOMENT

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.686 region:rollup2
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FAIR

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:36.288 region:rollup2
PLAN OVER FORTY YEARS AGO THE

00:27:34.686 --> 00:27:37.122 region:rollup2

REAGAN.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:42.027 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A NONPROFIT FIRED SURE

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:42.895 region:rollup2
OF LAST RESORT CALLED THE FAIR

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:44.530 region:rollup2

00:27:46.732 --> 00:27:50.402 region:rollup2
WHO COULD NOT FIND FIRE

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:51.870 region:rollup2
INSURANCE ON THE PRIVATE MARKET.

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:53.572 region:rollup2
THE FAIR PLAN IS THE CANARY IN

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.207 region:rollup2
THE COAL MINE ONE IMPORTANT

00:27:53.572 --> 00:27:57.309 region:rollup2
DECATUR OF THE AVAILABILITY OR

00:27:55.207 --> 00:27:58.877 region:rollup2
LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF HOME

00:27:57.309 --> 00:28:01.146 region:rollup2
INSURANCE FROM MINUTE COMMERCIAL

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:02.581 region:rollup2
CARRIERS. IS CHANGES IN THE

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:03.682 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF FIRE INSURANCE

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:05.951 region:rollup2
POLICIES WRITTEN BY THE FAIR

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:07.119 region:rollup2
PLAY SO IT BEARS NOTE I THINK

00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:08.654 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE.

00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:11.123 region:rollup2
AS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FAIR

00:28:08.654 --> 00:28:12.624 region:rollup2

00:28:23.302 --> 00:28:25.804 region:rollup2
BUT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:27.239 region:rollup2
FAIR PLAY AND IS THAT THAT LYING

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:28.473 region:rollup2
SURE THE FAIR PLAN POLICIES ARE

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:30.242 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN LARGE

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:31.710 region:rollup2

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:52.864 region:rollup2
THE FAIR PLAN HAS INCREASED ITS

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:54.566 region:rollup2
WRITINGS IN THE HIGH RISK FIRE

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:56.134 region:rollup2
AREAS. WHICH INDICATES THAT

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:57.469 region:rollup2
SOMEONE HOMEOWNERS ARE NOT

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:58.704 region:rollup2
FINDING AVAILABLE INSURANCE IN

00:28:57.469 --> 00:29:00.272 region:rollup2
THAT TRADITIONAL MARKET AND FOR

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:02.507 region:rollup2
THOSE HOMEOWNERS IT IS A PROBLEM

00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:04.643 region:rollup2
IT IS A CHALLENGE. AND THERE'S A

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:06.311 region:rollup2
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THOSE HOMES

00:29:04.643 --> 00:29:08.113 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR COUNTIES SO THIS

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:10.782 region:rollup2
IS BEING FELT MOST ACUTELY IN

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:12.084 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR COUNTIES AS WELL.

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:14.019 region:rollup2
KNOW OUR DATA SHOWS THE FAIR

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:14.886 region:rollup2
PLANTS NEW BUSINESS WRITINGS IN

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:17.956 region:rollup2
THE HIGH RISK FIRES ALMOST

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:19.391 region:rollup2
DOUBLED WELL RENEWALS IN THESE

00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:20.826 region:rollup2
AREAS INCREASED BALLOTS FOR A

00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:21.793 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT LET'S GO TO THE

00:29:20.826 --> 00:29:24.563 region:rollup2
NEXT SLIDE.

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:27.366 region:rollup2
SO LET ME REPEAT THAT AGAIN.

00:29:24.563 --> 00:29:27.633 region:rollup2
THEIR NEW WRITINGS ALMOST

00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:29.668 region:rollup2
DOUBLED.

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:31.403 region:rollup2
WENT UP BY FORTY ONE PERCENT.

00:29:29.668 --> 00:29:33.538 region:rollup2
AND THEIR ENEWALS INCREASED BY

00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:35.007 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT WHICH MEANS THAT

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:36.141 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT HAD THE FAIR PLAN.

00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:37.275 region:rollup2
THAT WE SAW AN INCREASE IN THE

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:39.378 region:rollup2
PEOPLE STICKING WITH THE FAIR

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:42.180 region:rollup2

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:43.882 region:rollup2
OTHER INSURANCE OUTSIDE OF THE

FAIR PLAN.

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:47.185 region:rollup2
SO.

00:29:45.751 --> 00:29:48.553 region:rollup2
IT MARCH TWENTY SIXTEEN I

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:50.389 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE SENATE

YEARS OF DROUGHT COMBINED WITH

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:57.162 region:rollup2
MORE HOMES BUILT IN HIGH RISK

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.397 region:rollup2
FIRE AREAS. WITH INSURERS USE

FORTRESS MODELS HAD RESULTED IN

00:30:00.432 --> 00:30:02.901 region:rollup2
HIGHER PRICES AND DECREASED

CERTAINLY LAST YEAR'S EVENTS

00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:15.013 region:rollup2
UNDERSCORE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:16.982 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO GROW. BY AND WE

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:18.517 region:rollup2
SEE MORE INSURERS CHOOSING TO

00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:20.419 region:rollup2
NOT RENEW COVERAGE FOR EXISTING

00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:21.987 region:rollup2
POLICYHOLDERS WHOSE HOMES FACE A

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:24.089 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK OF FIRE. IN SOME

00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:25.457 region:rollup2
INSURERS CHOOSING NOT TO WRITE

00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:27.826 region:rollup2

SWATHS OF THE HIGH RISK. AREAS

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.362 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW FROM EVALUATING

00:30:28.894 --> 00:30:31.763 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES FROM

00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:33.732 region:rollup2
CONSUMER COMPLAINTS THAT

00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:36.034 region:rollup2
INSURERS ARE BEGINNING TO AVOID

00:30:33.732 --> 00:30:37.502 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS OR LIMITING

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:41.673 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER POLICIES ARE WILLING

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:44.409 region:rollup2
TO WRITE. IN SUCH AREAS. NOW. UP

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:46.011 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A IT EACH INSURED

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:47.813 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES DECIDES WHAT THE RISK

00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:48.480 region:rollup2
APPETITE IS AND WHERE THEY GONNA

00:30:47.813 --> 00:30:49.748 region:rollup2
WRITE HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.917 region:rollup2
WRITE. THAT THERE ARE NONE THE

00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:53.185 region:rollup2
LESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOMEOWNER

00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:54.519 region:rollup2
NON RENEWED BY ONE INSURER TO

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:56.922 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY FIND INSURANCE

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:57.356 region:rollup2
COVERAGE FOR ANOTHER SHARE. WITH

00:30:56.922 --> 00:30:59.424 region:rollup2
A DILIGENT SEARCH.

00:30:57.356 --> 00:31:00.792 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:02.594 region:rollup2
SOME CONSUMERS ARE FINDING THEY

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:04.996 region:rollup2
CAN'T FIND INSURANCE LIMITED

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:06.965 region:rollup2
MARKET. AYE AND IF YOU HAVE A

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:08.066 region:rollup2
MORTGAGE LIKE MOST OF US DO. YOU

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:09.201 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE COVERAGE MATTER

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.936 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU LIVE.

00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:12.337 region:rollup2
AND CURRENT LAW DOES GIVE

00:31:10.936 --> 00:31:13.605 region:rollup2
INSURERS BROAD LATITUDE IN

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:15.207 region:rollup2
DECIDING WHETHER TO WRITE FOR

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:16.675 region:rollup2
CERTAIN RISKS. INCLUDING THE

00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:17.376 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO KLEIN WRITING

00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:19.311 region:rollup2
POLICIES FOR HOMES AND

00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:20.946 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AND THEY CAN CHARGE

00:31:19.311 --> 00:31:22.481 region:rollup2
MORE FOR HIGHER RISK TO ACCOUNT

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:25.117 region:rollup2
FOR THAT EXPECTED LOSSES

00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:26.551 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED. WITH THOSE RECEIPTS

00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:27.652 region:rollup2
IMPORTERS STAND THAT IS THE

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:30.088 region:rollup2
NATURE OF INSURANCE IT'S A

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:32.457 region:rollup2
PRODUCT THAT'S DESIGNED AT TO

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:33.558 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASS RISK IN THE PRICED

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:35.360 region:rollup2
RELATED. TO RISK.

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:37.362 region:rollup2
TWELVE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.898 region:rollup2
MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:43.068 region:rollup2

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:44.603 region:rollup2
RISK. OF WILDFIRE BY THE TWO

00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:46.805 region:rollup2
PRIMARY WILDFIRE RISK MODELS

00:31:44.603 --> 00:31:48.774 region:rollup2
USED BY INSURERS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:31:46.805 --> 00:31:51.009 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE HOMES IN

00:31:48.774 --> 00:31:53.111 region:rollup2
TWELVE THE COUNTY ARE LOCATED IN

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:55.814 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER VERY HIGH RISK AREA.

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:57.649 region:rollup2
pSIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF HOMES

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:58.917 region:rollup2
IN THESE CATEGORIES SO THERE IS

00:31:57.649 --> 00:32:00.452 region:rollup2
A CONCENTRATION OF THIS

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:02.888 region:rollup2
PHENOMENA WITHIN CERTAIN

00:32:00.452 --> 00:32:05.290 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN CERTAIN.

00:32:02.888 --> 00:32:07.259 region:rollup2
COUNTIES NOW. I DIRECTED AT MY

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.960 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TAKE A A NUMBER OF

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:10.796 region:rollup2
STEPS A BEFORE AND AFTER THE

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.664 region:rollup2
MARCH TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT I

00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:14.399 region:rollup2
SENATE HEARING. A ONE WAS A

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:15.367 region:rollup2
DIRECTED THAT WE PARTICIPATE

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.968 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S TREE

00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:18.703 region:rollup2
MORTALITY TASK FORCE INSURANCE

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:20.105 region:rollup2
SUB GROUP. AND THIS GROUP IS

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:21.406 region:rollup2
BEEN CHARGED WITH IDENTIFYING

00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:23.375 region:rollup2
INSURANCE ISSUES CAUSED BY THE

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:24.743 region:rollup2
MASSIVE NUMBER OF DYING TREES IN

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:27.078 region:rollup2
AREAS A CALIFORNIAN INCREASE

00:32:24.743 --> 00:32:28.547 region:rollup2
RISK OF WILDFIRE. THAT TASK

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:29.915 region:rollup2
FORCE WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IS

00:32:28.547 --> 00:32:31.550 region:rollup2
MEETING NOW FOR MORE THAN TWO

00:32:29.915 --> 00:32:33.385 region:rollup2
YEARS SINCE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.685 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN SOME PROPOSED

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:36.388 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS.

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:37.255 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WITHOUT NEW LAWS

00:32:36.388 --> 00:32:38.557 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TASK

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:40.125 region:rollup2
FORCE'S RECOMMENDATIONS REMAINS

00:32:38.557 --> 00:32:41.326 region:rollup2
A CHALLENGE THAT AS THEIR

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:42.794 region:rollup2
PROPOSED SOLUTIONS CURRENTLY

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:44.663 region:rollup2
RELY ON INSURERS MAKING

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:47.065 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY CHANGES. IN THEIR

00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:47.999 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS AND THEIR DECISION

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:50.135 region:rollup2
MAKING.

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:51.670 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THEN

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:53.004 region:rollup2
BY LESS LEGISLATURE ACTS WITH

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.273 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THE TASK FORCE'S

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:56.975 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS I ALSO DIRECTED

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:58.944 region:rollup2
MY DEPARTMENT UNDERTAKE ITS OWN

00:32:56.975 --> 00:33:00.111 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS AND COME UP WITH SOME

00:32:58.944 --> 00:33:01.146 region:rollup2
PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AS WELL IN

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:03.114 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE CONTAINED IN THE

00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:05.417 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT WE RELEASED. EARLIER

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:06.818 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR AT SO I'VE SHARED WITH

00:33:05.417 --> 00:33:08.687 region:rollup2
YOU AYE SOME OF THE RESULTS.

00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:10.555 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:33:08.687 --> 00:33:11.990 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT BASED ON CONSUMER

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:13.425 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS STEMMING FROM A

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.726 region:rollup2
RENEWAL ISSUES WE'RE ALSO SEEING

00:33:13.425 --> 00:33:16.228 region:rollup2
CONSUMER COMPLAINTS OF LARGE

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:17.662 region:rollup2
PREMIUM INCREASES IN THOSE ROSE

00:33:16.228 --> 00:33:19.531 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY FROM TWENTY TEN TO

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:21.233 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN. THAT PARTICULAR

00:33:19.531 --> 00:33:23.068 region:rollup2
IN THE ZIP CODES DESIGNATED BY

00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:24.736 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE AS HAVING THE GREATEST

00:33:23.068 --> 00:33:26.037 region:rollup2
RISK OF WILDFIRE.

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:27.539 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO COMPLAINTS

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:28.874 region:rollup2
FORGETTING ABOUT INCREASE

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:30.408 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS THE CALIFORNIA

00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:32.410 region:rollup2
DESIGNATED ZIP CODES MAKE UP

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:35.347 region:rollup2
MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.114 region:rollup2
THEIR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:38.483 region:rollup2
THOSE COMPLAINTS.

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:39.985 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE SEEN SEVERAL MAJOR

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:41.319 region:rollup2
INSURERS BEGINNING TO PULL BACK

00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:43.388 region:rollup2
FROM READING NEW BUSINESS.

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:45.357 region:rollup2
AND ALSO DECLINING TO RENEW.

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:47.359 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN SOME INCREASE IN

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:49.327 region:rollup2
FAIR PLAN WRITING AND WE'VE SEEN

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:52.130 region:rollup2
SOME INCREASE IN WRITING BY THE

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:54.332 region:rollup2
SURPLUS LINES INSURERS.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:56.034 region:rollup2
NOW THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:57.469 region:rollup2
ENACTED ANY SPECIFIC STATURE

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:59.070 region:rollup2
STANDARDS TO RESTRICT THE USE OF

00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:00.505 region:rollup2
OR ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THESE

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.007 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE RISK MODELS THAT THE

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:03.174 region:rollup2
INSURERS ARE USING.

00:34:02.007 --> 00:34:05.543 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO MECHANISM IN

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:07.846 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR CONSUMERS TO APPEAL

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:09.548 region:rollup2
THESE MODELS SO ONE OF OUR

00:34:07.846 --> 00:34:11.583 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT YOU DO

00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:13.518 region:rollup2
EXACTLYTHAT. AYE THAT YOU ABOUT

00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:14.753 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THE MODELS TO BE FILED

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:16.121 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEPARTMENT.

00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:17.255 region:rollup2
AND YOU GIVE THE DEPARTMENT

00:34:16.121 --> 00:34:18.557 region:rollup2
AFTER YOUR REVIEW AND APPROVE

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:20.292 region:rollup2
THEM WHAT'S PARTICULARLY

00:34:18.557 --> 00:34:21.459 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING FOR HOMEOWNERS THAT

00:34:20.292 --> 00:34:23.528 region:rollup2
IS WHEN THEY TAKE STEPS THAT

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:24.262 region:rollup2
THEIR LOCAL FIRE OFFICIALS HAVE

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:26.097 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED THEM TO TAKE.

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:27.499 region:rollup2
TO CREATE MORE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:30.168 region:rollup2
AND OTHERWISE MAKE THEIR HOMES

00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:32.003 region:rollup2
MORE DEFENSIBLE FROM FIRE THAT

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:34.639 region:rollup2
THOSE PARTICULAR MITIGATION

00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:36.374 region:rollup2
MEASURES ARE NOT IN SOME MODELS

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:39.044 region:rollup2
REFLECTED BY THE MODELS RICH

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:40.512 region:rollup2

00:34:39.044 --> 00:34:42.347 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE TAKING TO BETTER

00:34:40.512 --> 00:34:44.316 region:rollup2
DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM FIRE ARE

00:34:42.347 --> 00:34:47.085 region:rollup2
ALSO NOT BEING TAKEN INTO

00:34:44.316 --> 00:34:48.520 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT. A BY THE MODELS HENCE

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.888 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATION TO YOU ARE

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.656 region:rollup2
THAT THE MODELS BE REQUIRED TO

00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:53.792 region:rollup2
BE FILED AND THAT WE BE GIVEN

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:56.861 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY. I TO REVIEW

00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:57.562 region:rollup2
THEM THAT ACCORDINGLY. NOW I

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:59.965 region:rollup2
THINK THE OTHER.

00:34:57.562 --> 00:35:01.066 region:rollup2
THAT THING THAT WE'VE DONE AS

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:02.567 region:rollup2
WELL AS WE'VE TAKEN SOME

00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:04.469 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEPS WITH REGARD THE

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:06.604 region:rollup2
FAIR PLAN TO MAKE SURE. I IT'S

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:08.139 region:rollup2
MORE WIDELY KNOWN THAT IT EXISTS

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:10.809 region:rollup2
THAT WE MAY ASK THE FAIR PLAYING

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:11.910 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT APPROVED ITS

00:35:10.809 --> 00:35:13.745 region:rollup2
TO ITS POLICIES IN MARKETING.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.780 region:rollup2
BUT CONDUCTED OUTREACH.

00:35:13.745 --> 00:35:17.215 region:rollup2
DEMI VAST AND IN FACT WE

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.850 region:rollup2
SPONSORED LEGISLATION CARRIED BY

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:20.919 region:rollup2
SENATOR MCGUIRE THAT ACTUALLY

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:23.021 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THAT INSURERS AND

00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:23.455 region:rollup2
AGENTS AND BROKERS TO INFORM

00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:25.490 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS ABOUT THE

00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:27.092 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.593 region:rollup2
OF THE FAIR PLAN WE'RE ALSO

00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:29.427 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING INSURERS TO WRITE

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:31.229 region:rollup2
WHAT'S CALLED DIFFERENCES N

CONDITIONS COVERAGE WHICH SITS

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:34.366 region:rollup2
ON TOP OF THE FAIR PLANTS UP A

HOMEOWNER. HAS ONLY THE FAIR

00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:37.702 region:rollup2
PLAN TO LOOK TO FOR FIRE

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:39.104 region:rollup2
INSURANCE WE'RE ASKING INSURERS

00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:40.939 region:rollup2
TO WRITE COVERAGE ON TOP OF THAT

00:35:39.104 --> 00:35:42.674 region:rollup2
SO HOMEOWNERS HAVE FULLY

00:35:40.939 --> 00:35:44.275 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. INSURANCE AVAILABLE

00:35:42.674 --> 00:35:46.945 region:rollup2
TO THEM MISSIONER JONES COULD I

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:48.046 region:rollup2
ASK YOU ARE FREE TO A CLOSE.

00:35:46.945 --> 00:35:50.582 region:rollup2
I I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED A GOOD

00:35:48.046 --> 00:35:52.550 region:rollup2
POLITICIAN HAS A LOT TO SAY.

00:35:50.582 --> 00:35:54.285 region:rollup2
GOOD INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAS

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.986 region:rollup2
A LOT TO SAY THERE YOU GO THAT'S

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:57.422 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT.

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:59.257 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US.

00:35:57.422 --> 00:36:00.225 region:rollup2
THE SORT OF.

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:02.827 region:rollup2
THE ESSENCE OF WHAT YOU WOULD

00:36:00.225 --> 00:36:04.496 region:rollup2
LIKE US TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:05.764 region:rollup2
WE GO FORWARD WONDERFUL SO LET

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:07.465 region:rollup2
ME JUST DRILL DOWN TO SOME

00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:09.601 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE.

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:11.903 region:rollup2
IN OUR REPORT OUTSIDE THAT

00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:13.004 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:15.273 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASS.

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:17.709 region:rollup2
ONE IS THOUGHT WE HAVE

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:18.877 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED I THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:20.378 region:rollup2
REQUIRE INSURERS TO OFFER

00:36:18.877 --> 00:36:21.980 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN THE

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:24.215 region:rollup2
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE IF%

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.151 region:rollup2
SPECIFIED PROVEN MITIGATION

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:27.852 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS. HAVE BEEN MADE BY

00:36:26.151 --> 00:36:29.587 region:rollup2
THE HOMEOWNER TO THE DWELLING

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:30.622 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE AND THE PROPERTY.

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:32.023 region:rollup2
AND.

00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:33.024 region:rollup2
THAT'S STANDARD OF COURSE WOULD

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:35.026 region:rollup2
BE DEFINED BY YOU THE

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:36.628 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IT CAN BE AS HIGH AS

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:38.596 region:rollup2
YOU DEEM APPROPRIATE BUT THE

00:36:36.628 --> 00:36:40.131 region:rollup2
NOTION WOULD BE IF HOMEOWNERS

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:41.399 region:rollup2
MEDIA STANDARD. THEN THEY SHOULD

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:43.301 region:rollup2
BE OFFERED INSURANCE NO

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:45.070 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE TO THAT WOULD BE TO

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:47.472 region:rollup2
SAY THE INSURER LOOK.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:49.541 region:rollup2
YEAH I AS AN ALTERNATE ACTUALLY

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:50.909 region:rollup2
OFFERING THE INSURANCE AT A

00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:52.377 region:rollup2
MINIMUM OFFER DIFFERENCES IN

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:54.145 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS POLICY SO THAT

00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:55.380 region:rollup2
SOMEONE MEETS A STANDARD OF

00:36:54.145 --> 00:36:56.781 region:rollup2
MITIGATION.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.250 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO OFFER

00:36:56.781 --> 00:37:00.618 region:rollup2
THEM A HOME INSURANCE THAT THEY

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.886 region:rollup2
GET INSURANCE FROM THE FAIR PLAN

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:03.521 region:rollup2
AT LEAST GIVE THEM DIFFERENCES

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:05.156 region:rollup2
IN CONDITIONS COVERAGE SO THEY

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:06.624 region:rollup2
HAVE FULL INSURANCE A SECOND

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:07.859 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION IS TO REQUIRE

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:10.095 region:rollup2
INSURERS TO OFFER MITIGATION

00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:11.529 region:rollup2
PREMIUM CREDIT. FOR THOSE

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:12.831 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS ARE COMMUNITIES

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:14.699 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE UNDERTAKEN PROVEN

00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:15.567 region:rollup2
MITIGATION EFFORTS AGAIN THE

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:17.602 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WOULD DEFINE THOSE

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.603 region:rollup2
YOU COULD FIND THAT MITIGATION

00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:20.271 region:rollup2
STANDARDS HIGH AS YOU WANT.

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:21.773 region:rollup2
OTHER WE THINK THE NOTION OF A

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:23.074 region:rollup2
PRIMA CREDIT MAKE SENSE BOTH AS

00:37:21.773 --> 00:37:25.076 region:rollup2
AN INCENTIVE BUT ALSO TO

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.977 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THOSE HOMEOWNERS IN

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:27.912 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DOING

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:30.115 region:rollup2
THINGS TO MAKE THEMSELVES MORE

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:31.349 region:rollup2
DEFENSIBLE. FROM FIRES I

00:37:30.115 --> 00:37:34.185 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:36.988 region:rollup2
REQUIRING INSURERS TO FILE

VIRUS BOTTLES A FOURTH

00:37:39.224 --> 00:37:42.927 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION IS AN APPEALS

00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:45.597 region:rollup2
FOR HOMEOWNERS.

00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:46.831 region:rollup2
A FORD INSURERS ADVERSE DECISION

00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:47.599 region:rollup2
TO NOT RENEW CANCEL IS FINALIZED

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:48.466 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO REAL

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:49.100 region:rollup2

FIFTH WE THINK THAT THERE BE

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:57.742 region:rollup2
SOME REAL VALUE IN TERMS OF

STABILIZING THE RATING STRUCTURE

EXCESSIVE FOR THE UNDERLYING

OF OUR A PRINCIPLE

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:20.198 region:rollup2

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:55.800 region:rollup2
BEING OUT OF THE MARKET FOR OVER

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:57.068 region:rollup2
A DECADE. AYE SO WE WANT TO MAKE

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.304 region:rollup2
SURE THE INSURERS ARE HERE WE

00:38:57.068 --> 00:39:00.972 region:rollup2
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT

00:39:57.896 --> 00:40:00.832 region:rollup2
YIELDING TIME TO A COMMISSIONER

00:39:59.364 --> 00:40:03.034 region:rollup2
JONES IN IN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE

00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:04.702 region:rollup2
HIS HIS COMMENT. AND THE SUPPORT

00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:06.304 region:rollup2
THAT THEY PROVIDED A OVER THE

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:08.439 region:rollup2
LAST FEW YEARS IN REGARD TO

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:09.507 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND OUR INVOLVEMENT AT

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:12.810 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE TREE

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:13.211 region:rollup2
MORTALITY TASK FORCE TO TRY TO

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.645 region:rollup2
DRILL DOWN.

00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:14.646 region:rollup2
ON SOME OF THOSE.

00:40:13.645 --> 00:40:16.447 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS

00:40:14.646 --> 00:40:17.448 region:rollup2
REGARDING INSURANCE SO WE SHOULD

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:19.851 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THEY

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:22.020 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY ABOUT A DROUGHT CLIMATE.

00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:23.588 region:rollup2
A CLIMATE CHANGE AND IN FIRE AND

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.689 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS THAT'S HAVING ON ON

00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:26.224 region:rollup2
OUR FIRES THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:27.292 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE. AND LITTLE BIT

00:40:26.224 --> 00:40:28.493 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOR STEALTH AND FIRE

00:40:27.292 --> 00:40:30.928 region:rollup2
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND AND

00:40:28.493 --> 00:40:31.896 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO AND ARE TRYING TO DO

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.598 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:34.632 region:rollup2
TO BEGIN WITH OBVIOUSLY WE'VE

00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:36.000 region:rollup2
SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ACROSS

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:37.635 region:rollup2
THE LANDSCAPE OF THE TREE

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.836 region:rollup2
MORTALITY IS IS RELATIVELY

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.939 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED.

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:42.707 region:rollup2
IN RECENT HISTORY OF THAT LEVEL

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:44.175 region:rollup2
OF MORTALITY.

00:40:42.707 --> 00:40:44.709 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT THE HOTTER DRIER

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.843 region:rollup2
AREAS.

00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:46.978 region:rollup2
OR WHERE WE'RE SEEING THE

00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:48.947 region:rollup2
GREATEST LEVEL OF MORTALITY

00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:50.848 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING VEGETATION CHANGES

00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:51.582 region:rollup2
NOW ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE THAT

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:54.152 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BECOME.

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:55.420 region:rollup2
THE RESTORED BACK TO FOREST'S

00:40:54.152 --> 00:40:57.355 region:rollup2
THESE THESE ARE AREAS THAT MAY

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.089 region:rollup2
END UP BRUSH DOMINATED HABITATS

00:40:57.355 --> 00:40:59.490 region:rollup2
IN GRASS.

00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:00.925 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD BUT

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.293 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFERENT AND IT'S A CHANGE

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:03.628 region:rollup2
IN THE WILDLIFE POPULATIONS OUT

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:04.862 region:rollup2
OF THEM THAT'LL DEPEND ON THOSE

00:41:03.628 --> 00:41:06.464 region:rollup2
SITES WILL CHANGE.

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:07.865 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:09.400 region:rollup2
SOME WATER QUALITY IMPACTS IN

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:12.303 region:rollup2
THOSE OTHER BENEFICIAL USES OUT

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.671 region:rollup2
WILL RELY ON THOSE THOSE AREAS.

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.939 region:rollup2
.

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.407 region:rollup2
IN REGARD THE FIRE SEASON THAT

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:17.809 region:rollup2
WE HAD TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:19.010 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:20.311 region:rollup2
ARCHER JACKSON DIDN'T AND

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.479 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING JOB SUMMARIZING

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:23.081 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WON'T SPEND A LOT OF

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:24.082 region:rollup2
TIME RE GOING THROUGH SOME OF

00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.383 region:rollup2
THOSE STATISTICS BUT I DO THINK

00:41:24.082 --> 00:41:26.851 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:28.286 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:30.188 region:rollup2
CHANGES. THE RECENT.

00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:30.855 region:rollup2
THE NEW WEATHER CHANGES THAT WE

00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:32.357 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:33.958 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE MEGA FIRES IS

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:36.594 region:rollup2
RECALLING THEM ARE NOT.

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:38.930 region:rollup2
NEW IT'S THE NEW NORMAL.

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:40.164 region:rollup2
BUT. THE TYPES OF WEATHER THAT

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.899 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING AFFILIATED THAT'S

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:43.735 region:rollup2
DRIVING THESE FIRES AND MAKING

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:44.969 region:rollup2
THEM LAW LARGE AND DAMAGING. IS

00:41:43.735 --> 00:41:46.304 region:rollup2
A LITTLE DIFFERENT WE HAD A

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:47.372 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN DAY SANTA ANA WIND

00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:49.173 region:rollup2
EVENT DOWN IN SOUTHERN

00:41:47.372 --> 00:41:50.274 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE FIRST

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:52.010 region:rollup2
TIME WE'VE SEEN THAT LEVEL OF

00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:53.611 region:rollup2
WIND. OVER THAT MANY DAYS

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.879 region:rollup2
CAUSING RED FLAG WARNINGS AND

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:56.781 region:rollup2
AND IN HISTORY.

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:57.348 region:rollup2
THE WIND EVENT THAT WE HAD UP

00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:59.450 region:rollup2
UP NORTH.

00:41:57.348 --> 00:42:00.818 region:rollup2
TOWARDS SANTA ROSA THOSE

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.754 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO AS A MOUNTAIN WAVE.

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:04.255 region:rollup2
I'M NOT OF NEUROLOGISTS BUT I

00:42:02.754 --> 00:42:05.957 region:rollup2
CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S A RESULT

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:07.191 region:rollup2
OF A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER

00:42:05.957 --> 00:42:08.259 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.862 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY PUSHES.

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:12.463 region:rollup2
THAT WIND OVER THE THE THE

00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:13.798 region:rollup2
HILLS GOING TOWARD SANTA ROSA IS

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:15.633 region:rollup2
THAT NGUYEN BECOMES IN ALIGNMENT

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:16.801 region:rollup2
WITH THE DRAINAGE IS IT

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:18.236 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN WIND SPEED AND WE

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:20.171 region:rollup2
SAW WIND SPEEDS AND NORTHERN BAY

00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:21.039 region:rollup2
AREA THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN. OUR

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:23.241 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT THE HIGHEST WIND

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:26.444 region:rollup2
SPEEDS WE'VE WE'VE EVER SEEN SO.

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:27.044 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT A WIND EVENTS

00:42:26.444 --> 00:42:29.180 region:rollup2
AFFILIATED WITH THESE FIRES.

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.781 region:rollup2
PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WHAT

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.216 region:rollup2
WERE FOCUSING.

00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:32.984 region:rollup2
UP PROVIDING A LOT OF FOCUS ON

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:34.152 region:rollup2
IS TAKING A LANDSCAPE LEVEL

00:42:32.984 --> 00:42:35.553 region:rollup2
APPROACH

00:42:34.152 --> 00:42:36.888 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THESE FIRES ARE BURNING

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:38.656 region:rollup2
OUT OF OUR WILD LANDS OUT OF ARE

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:40.091 region:rollup2
FORCED INTO OUR CITIES SO IT'S

00:42:38.656 --> 00:42:41.259 region:rollup2
IT'S COMPLETELY REASONABLE THAT

00:42:40.091 --> 00:42:42.727 region:rollup2
WE WOULD TAKE A LANDSCAPE

00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:44.429 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND TRY TO ADDRESS SOME

00:42:42.727 --> 00:42:45.229 region:rollup2
OF THESE ISSUES. COME WERE WHAT

00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:46.998 region:rollup2
THEY WERE WORKING IN THE UPPER

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:48.699 region:rollup2
WATERSHEDS IN IN THE HEADWATERS

00:42:46.998 --> 00:42:50.068 region:rollup2
AREAS CONDUCTING FORCE

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:51.669 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SPENDING

00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:53.371 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED FIRE.

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:55.239 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDDLE WATER SHEDS WERE

00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:57.108 region:rollup2
WERE WERE FOCUSING IN WILDLAND

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:58.009 region:rollup2
URBAN INTERFACE SHARE AREAS OF

00:42:57.108 --> 00:42:59.177 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES

00:42:58.009 --> 00:43:00.945 region:rollup2
AROUND OUR LOWER REACHES OF OUR

00:42:59.177 --> 00:43:02.213 region:rollup2
WATERSHEDS WHERE WE'RE COMBINING

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:03.614 region:rollup2
FOR STEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION

00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:05.950 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES ULTIMATELY TO HELP

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:07.418 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE ISSUE. WE KNOW WE

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.086 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE.

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:10.655 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME OF THESE FIRES

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:11.789 region:rollup2
THROUGH FORCE MANAGEMENT AND

00:43:10.655 --> 00:43:13.424 region:rollup2
ENFORCED HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:15.293 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION. AND.

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:18.563 region:rollup2
THAT IS OUR FOCUS WERE VERY

00:43:15.293 --> 00:43:19.063 region:rollup2
MUCH FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE

00:43:18.563 --> 00:43:19.497 region:rollup2
PACE AND SCALE OF THESE

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:20.531 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES.

00:43:19.497 --> 00:43:21.966 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE.

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:23.301 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INVESTMENT

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:24.769 region:rollup2
OR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS TO HELP

00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:26.404 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SOME OF THESE LANDSCAPE

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:28.473 region:rollup2
LEVEL ACTIVITIES AND.

00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:29.640 region:rollup2
WE WILL CONTINUE BEING TO BE

00:43:28.473 --> 00:43:32.043 region:rollup2
ENGAGE THEIR.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.777 region:rollup2
IN REGARD TO HIGH FIRE RISK AND

00:43:32.043 --> 00:43:34.045 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S REACHED

00:43:32.777 --> 00:43:36.047 region:rollup2
PERMANENT CATASTROPHIC.

00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:37.715 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONS I THINK IT'S

00:43:36.047 --> 00:43:39.784 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:41.152 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE ARE

00:43:39.784 --> 00:43:43.321 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH AND FIRE RISK.

00:43:41.152 --> 00:43:43.521 region:rollup2
IS FAR IS A WORD PERMANENCE

00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:45.490 region:rollup2
GOES.

00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:46.791 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.758 region:rollup2
THE FIRE ENVIRONMENT AROUND

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:49.460 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THROUGH FIRE

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:50.928 region:rollup2
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES WE KNOW

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.697 region:rollup2
THIS BY DOING THE DEFENSIBLE

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:54.665 region:rollup2
SPACE BY STRUCTURE HARDENING BY

00:43:52.697 --> 00:43:57.001 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE DO IN

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:57.935 region:rollup2
FRE PREVENTION. HOT WE HAVE THE

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:59.470 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO CHANGE THAT

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:01.372 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT ULTIMATELY

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:03.474 region:rollup2
CREATES HOMES AND COMMUNITIES.

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:05.376 region:rollup2
IN A MORE SAFE CONDITION AND

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:07.411 region:rollup2
CAN REDUCE THE FIRE RISK

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:08.846 region:rollup2
AFFILIATED WITH THAT. I THINK

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:10.181 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:11.716 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FIRE

00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:12.984 region:rollup2
PREVENTION VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE

00:44:11.716 --> 00:44:14.819 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND CAL

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.486 region:rollup2
FIRE TOUCH ON FIRE PREVENTION.

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:17.355 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S OUR FORCE

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:19.390 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES REDUCING

00:44:17.355 --> 00:44:20.458 region:rollup2
FUELS PRESCRIBED FIRE FARTHER

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.526 region:rollup2
DOWN THE WATERSHEDS WHAT WE'RE

00:44:20.458 --> 00:44:22.793 region:rollup2
DOING.

00:44:21.526 --> 00:44:24.061 region:rollup2
MORE FIRE ENGINEERING IN

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:25.129 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:26.264 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS THAT

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:28.432 region:rollup2
WERE PROVIDING THE LOCAL FIRE

00:44:26.264 --> 00:44:30.168 region:rollup2
SAFE COUNCILS DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:32.236 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS A PUBLIC EDUCATION

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:33.771 region:rollup2
AND OUTREACH ALL OF THIS THE

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:35.640 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WE HAVE TOUCH ON SOME

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:37.008 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF FIRE PREVENTION SO.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.809 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A THAT

00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:40.845 region:rollup2
APARTMENT AND AND WHAT ROLE WE

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:42.713 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN FIRE PREVENTION. IT'S

00:44:40.845 --> 00:44:44.081 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH WHAT WE DO IT'S NOT

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:45.616 region:rollup2
JUST THE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:47.752 region:rollup2
FIRE IT'S DURING THE FIRE IMPOSE

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:49.487 region:rollup2
FIRE IT'S VERY MUCH A CYCLE THAT

00:44:47.752 --> 00:44:50.755 region:rollup2
WE USE TO ANALYZE AND

00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:52.323 region:rollup2
CONTINUALLY MONITOR FIRE

00:44:50.755 --> 00:44:54.358 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

00:44:52.323 --> 00:44:56.294 region:rollup2
AS THEY EXIST WE USE IT AND

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:57.962 region:rollup2
PLANNING DURING A GOING FIRE AND

00:44:56.294 --> 00:44:58.863 region:rollup2
WE ALSO USE IT IN OUR FOLLOW UP

00:44:57.962 --> 00:45:00.531 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH WATER BY

00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:01.966 region:rollup2
WATERSHED EMERGENCY RESPONSE

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:03.467 region:rollup2
EFFORTS AS WELL AS DAMAGE

00:45:01.966 --> 00:45:04.936 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT GOING INTO AREAS.

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:06.704 region:rollup2
DETERMINING WHAT THE MEDICATIONS

00:45:04.936 --> 00:45:08.172 region:rollup2
WERE ON THOSE HOMES THAT WERE

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:11.676 region:rollup2
DAMAGED OR DESTROYED AND AND AND

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:12.143 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY ANALYING THE

00:45:11.676 --> 00:45:12.476 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE

00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:12.910 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS.

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.345 region:rollup2
.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:17.448 region:rollup2
IN THE CONTEXT OF INSURANCE.

00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:19.216 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:20.585 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS FOCUSED ON ABOUT

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.886 region:rollup2
TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO OR TWO

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:23.154 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO OR SO WITHIN THE

00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:24.889 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF THE TREE MORTALITY

00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:26.023 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE. SOME OF THE COUNTY

00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:28.125 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS OR THE COUNTY

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:29.393 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES HAD COME FORWARD

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:30.895 region:rollup2
AND RECOGNIZED OR OR VOICED A

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:32.229 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT SOME OF THEIR

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:33.397 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS WERE HAVING TO

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:35.066 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WITH INSURANCE.

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:36.500 region:rollup2
WE SAW AND AND VERY MUCH

00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:38.536 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE TREE MORTALITY

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.338 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE STRUCTURE AND THAT IT

00:45:38.536 --> 00:45:41.639 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FOR COMMUNICATION. AND

00:45:40.338 --> 00:45:42.707 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO

00:45:41.639 --> 00:45:43.774 region:rollup2
COME TOGETHER.

00:45:42.707 --> 00:45:44.875 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IT'S BASED ON THE

00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:46.477 region:rollup2
INSTANT INCIDENT COMMAND

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:47.945 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THE SAME STRUCTURE WE

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:49.614 region:rollup2
USE FOR ANY WILDLAND INCIDENT

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:52.216 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED ANYWHERE NAY EXPANDS

00:45:49.614 --> 00:45:52.817 region:rollup2
AND CONTRACTS WITH THE

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:54.352 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY OF THAT INCIDENT.

00:45:52.817 --> 00:45:55.987 region:rollup2
.

00:45:54.352 --> 00:45:56.921 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO CREATE A NEUTRAL

00:45:55.987 --> 00:45:58.990 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE COULD COME

00:45:56.921 --> 00:46:00.625 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WEEK EVERYBODY HAD THE

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.093 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.

00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:05.196 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX TO.

00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:06.330 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES CAN BE A LITTLE BIT

00:46:05.196 --> 00:46:08.232 region:rollup2
STRESSED.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.734 region:rollup2
TOPIC BUT WE WANTED TO GIVE

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:11.168 region:rollup2
EVERYONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:12.503 region:rollup2
HEARD AND COME TOGETHER SO VERY

00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:13.871 region:rollup2
QUICKLY WHAT WE DID IS ORGANIZED

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:16.207 region:rollup2
A WORKSHOP TO WHERE WE BROUGHT

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:17.341 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE. REPRESENTATIVES FROM

00:46:16.207 --> 00:46:19.343 region:rollup2
INSURANCE INDUSTRIES.

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:21.078 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WAS A

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:22.380 region:rollup2
GREAT SUPPORT WITHOUT BOND OTHER

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:23.481 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT WERE INTERESTED IN

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.850 region:rollup2
COMING TO THE TABLE AND REALLY

00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:27.118 region:rollup2
EDUCATING OURSELVES ON WHAT SOME

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:29.086 region:rollup2
OF THE INSURANCE ISSUES WERE.

00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:30.621 region:rollup2
FROM THAT WE WE REALIZE THAT

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:32.957 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A NEED TO FOCUS MORE

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:34.825 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY ON INSURANCEAND SO.

00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:36.327 region:rollup2
WE CREATED AN INSURANCE SUB

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:37.528 region:rollup2
GROUP AND I SHOULD SAY THAT

00:46:36.327 --> 00:46:39.096 region:rollup2
UNDER THE TREE MORTALITY THE

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:41.265 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS WORKING GROUP WHICH

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:42.900 region:rollup2
I AM THE CO CHAIR. ESTABLISH TO

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:43.467 region:rollup2
THE THE SUBGROUP OR THE

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.169 region:rollup2
INSURANCE GROUP UNDERNEATH.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:46.370 region:rollup2
.

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:48.305 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LARGELY WE WANTED

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.806 region:rollup2
EDUCATE OURSELVES WE WANTED TO

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:50.708 region:rollup2
TRY TO FRAME UP.

00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:52.176 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE

00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:53.644 region:rollup2
CONCERNS REALLY WERE AND THEN WE

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:55.212 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:56.414 region:rollup2
WE WERE REFERRING TO WAS A NON

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:58.382 region:rollup2
REGULATORY SOLUTION.

00:46:56.414 --> 00:46:59.817 region:rollup2
THIS WAS LARGELY BECAUSE WE FELT

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:01.085 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU START

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:02.520 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT CHANGING STATUTE

00:47:01.085 --> 00:47:03.954 region:rollup2
OR LAW CHANGES THE DYNAMIC OF

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.489 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNICATION WE WANTED TO

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:06.857 region:rollup2
REALLY EDUCATE OURSELVES ON WHAT

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:08.592 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES WERE.

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:09.193 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE VERY EFFECTIVE AT

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:11.429 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:12.530 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S BEEN A GREAT

00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:14.965 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY WE QUICKLY SIDE

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:16.934 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT BETWEEN. ON THE

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:18.636 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:20.471 region:rollup2
OR THE FIRE PREVENTION PRACTICES

00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:22.073 region:rollup2
A DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT WE WOULD

00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:24.108 region:rollup2
CREATE AROUND HOMES AND HOW THE

00:47:22.073 --> 00:47:25.509 region:rollup2
* DOES THAT RISK MODELS WERE

00:47:24.108 --> 00:47:26.677 region:rollup2
USING THAT INFORMATION.

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:28.045 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THE RISK MODELS

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:29.380 region:rollup2
RELYING ON VEGETATION SLOW OPEN

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:30.981 region:rollup2
ACCESS

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.017 region:rollup2
THAT VEGETATION COMPONENT

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:34.285 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ALLOW OR DOESN'T TAKE

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:35.720 region:rollup2
INTO CONSIDERATION THE SURFACE

00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:36.754 region:rollup2
IN LATTER FUEL REDUCTION THAT WE

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.422 region:rollup2
COMMONLY REQUIRE UNDER

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:39.590 region:rollup2
DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLEARING.

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:42.026 region:rollup2
DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.493 region:rollup2
AS AS TO MISTER JONES INDICATED

00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:43.694 region:rollup2
THE FUEL BREAKS AROUND

00:47:42.493 --> 00:47:45.896 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:47.498 region:rollup2
SO WE WE SAW THERE BOTH A

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:49.867 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT IN AN OPPORTUNITY AN

00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:50.801 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY SO THAT IF WE COULD

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:53.237 region:rollup2
CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:54.672 region:rollup2
LANDOWNERS HOMEOWNERS TO CREATE

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:55.506 region:rollup2
THIS DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND IT

00:47:54.672 --> 00:47:57.007 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE TAKEN INTO

00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:58.309 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION IN THE FIRE RISK

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:59.443 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN HAD DEVELOPED FOR

00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:01.045 region:rollup2
THEIR PROPERTY.

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:03.147 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE A WIN WIN FOR

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:04.815 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY AND SO THAT'S THE ROAD

00:48:03.147 --> 00:48:06.951 region:rollup2
WE STARTED GOING DOWN. OUT WE

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:07.251 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED A TIERED RISK MODEL

00:48:06.951 --> 00:48:07.918 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A.

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:09.120 region:rollup2
.

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:11.288 region:rollup2
A WILDFIRE.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.523 region:rollup2
INSURANCE MODEL AGAIN IN

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:14.792 region:rollup2
COOPERATION WITH THE INSURANCE

00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:16.694 region:rollup2
SUB GROUP THAT INVOLVED ALL OF

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:18.696 region:rollup2
THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES.

00:48:16.694 --> 00:48:20.698 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY.

00:48:18.696 --> 00:48:21.532 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAME UP WITH WAS A THREE

00:48:20.698 --> 00:48:23.300 region:rollup2
TIERED APPROACH?

00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:25.403 region:rollup2
THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.470 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE AND AND RISK

00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:28.272 region:rollup2
AFFILIATED WITH STRUCTURES THE

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:30.341 region:rollup2
FIRST BEING MORE SPECIFIC TO

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:31.041 region:rollup2
DEFENSIBLE SPACE THE NEXT THE

00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:33.277 region:rollup2
NEXT LAYER THE NEXT.

00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:34.845 region:rollup2
LEVEL BEING DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:35.946 region:rollup2
PLUS ADDITIONAL WHAT WE CALL

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:37.214 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE HARDENING.

00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:39.016 region:rollup2
THESE ARE BUILDING CODES.

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:41.118 region:rollup2
THESE ARE BUILDING MATERIALS

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:42.553 region:rollup2
SUCH AS A DECK MATERIAL CITING

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:45.022 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LESS COMBUSTIBLE AND

00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:46.624 region:rollup2
THEN THE THIRD BEING. ALL THREE

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:47.925 region:rollup2
OF THOSE COMBINED INTO ONE.

00:48:46.624 --> 00:48:48.692 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ADDITIONAL STRUCTURE

00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:51.295 region:rollup2
HARDENING.

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:53.764 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS AND SO THIS WAS.

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:55.032 region:rollup2
THAT CONCEPT IN A MODEL THAT WE

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:56.567 region:rollup2
PUT TOGETHER A WE WE'VE

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:58.202 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED IT INTO A RIGHT A

00:48:56.567 --> 00:48:59.703 region:rollup2
WHITE PAPER IT'S CURRENTLY IN

00:48:58.202 --> 00:49:01.338 region:rollup2
DRAFT FORM. AND.

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:03.073 region:rollup2
THE HOPE IS THAT WE.

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:04.842 region:rollup2
FINALIZE THAT DRAFT AND BRING

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:06.610 region:rollup2
IT TO THE FULL TREE MORTALITY

00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:08.345 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE FROM THE RATE THEY

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:09.480 region:rollup2
INSURANCE SUB GROUP HERE IN THE

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.114 region:rollup2
NEXT FEW MONTHS.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.081 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:13.117 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA.

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:14.518 region:rollup2
AGAIN THANK ALL THE FOLKS THAT

SUB GROUP AND THE TREE MORTALITY

00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:19.323 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE IT'S BEEN A HUGE

00:49:17.455 --> 00:49:19.890 region:rollup2
LEARNING EXPERIENCE SAYS MOST OF

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:21.692 region:rollup2
US ARE NOT INSURANCE EXPERTS

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.993 region:rollup2
AND.

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:24.094 region:rollup2
AGAIN I WANT TO TAKE DEPARTMENT

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:25.863 region:rollup2

VENTURA AND THEN WHEN IT MOVED

00:49:53.324 --> 00:49:57.995 region:rollup2
TO ONE SETO INCENTIVE I RECOUNT

00:49:55.626 --> 00:49:59.630 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND YOUR STAFF HAVE BEEN.

00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:01.732 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL AND

00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:05.395 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY.

00:56:04.695 --> 00:56:08.465 region:rollup2
.

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:09.867 region:rollup2
THOROUGH AND DETAILED ANALYSIS.

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:12.102 region:rollup2
IT IS THE CASE.

00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:13.437 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE VOTERS ENACTED

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:15.272 region:rollup2
PROP ONE OF THREE IN THE STATE

00:56:13.437 --> 00:56:16.840 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA. A WHICH PROVIDES

00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:18.108 region:rollup2
THAT INSURERS HAVE TO JUSTIFY

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.010 region:rollup2
THEIR RATES.

00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:20.944 region:rollup2
IF THEIR PROPERTY CASUALTY

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:22.946 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.747 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY THEY DO THAT IS BY

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:26.283 region:rollup2
SUBMITTING THEIR RATES TO THE

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:27.551 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. THEY SUBMIT THEIR

00:56:26.283 --> 00:56:29.386 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN LOS

00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:31.088 region:rollup2
DATA THAT THEY SUBMIT THEIR

00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:33.123 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

00:56:31.088 --> 00:56:36.026 region:rollup2
THEY IDENTIFY.

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:36.927 region:rollup2
SOME AMOUNT OF.

00:56:36.026 --> 00:56:37.928 region:rollup2
RETURN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:56:36.927 --> 00:56:41.431 region:rollup2
MAKE.

00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:43.033 region:rollup2
THEN WE APPLY VERY DETAILED

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:45.168 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ONLY BASED.

00:56:43.033 --> 00:56:47.604 region:rollup2
RAINN FACTORS IN DEVELOPMENT

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:49.206 region:rollup2
STANDARDS DETERMINE WHAT WHAT

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:52.342 region:rollup2
THE RATE SHOULD BE.

00:56:49.206 --> 00:56:54.111 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY INSURERS ARE USING

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:54.678 region:rollup2
A FORWARD LOOKING PREDICTIVE

00:56:54.111 --> 00:56:56.647 region:rollup2
MODELS I MENTION THESE WILD

00:56:54.678 --> 00:56:58.415 region:rollup2
FIRE.

00:56:56.647 --> 00:56:58.949 region:rollup2
I RISK MODELS THEY'RE BEING USED

00:56:58.415 --> 00:56:59.983 region:rollup2
BOTH FOR UNDERWRITING AND

00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:03.353 region:rollup2
RATING.

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:05.022 region:rollup2
AND I ANTICIPATE THAT HIM OF

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:07.391 region:rollup2
RAPE FILINGS WE'RE GOING TO SEE.

00:57:05.022 --> 00:57:09.860 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR

00:57:07.391 --> 00:57:10.460 region:rollup2
INCREASES BASED ON THAT THESE

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.562 region:rollup2
MOST RECENT LOSSES BY AS WELL

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:14.598 region:rollup2
AS.

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:17.768 region:rollup2
INDICATIONS OF WHAT THESE

00:57:14.598 --> 00:57:19.369 region:rollup2
MODELS ARE PREDICTING GOING FOR.

00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:20.704 region:rollup2
I THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME OF

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:22.606 region:rollup2
PROP ONE OF THREE.

00:57:20.704 --> 00:57:24.074 region:rollup2
WHAT YEAR WAS THAT OPPOSE

00:57:22.606 --> 00:57:26.276 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THEN?

00:57:24.074 --> 00:57:28.779 region:rollup2
I'M REMINDED BY MY CHIEF DEPUTY

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:30.414 region:rollup2
MISTER LAU SURE WHO I WAS REMISS

00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:30.814 region:rollup2
IN NOT INTRODUCING EARLIER.

00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:33.617 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:35.118 region:rollup2
THE RATE DEVELOPMENT FACTORS

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:36.253 region:rollup2
ALSO INCLUDE WHAT'S CALLED A

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:38.722 region:rollup2
THAT CATASTROPHE LOADER

00:57:36.253 --> 00:57:40.090 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHE FACTOR AND WHAT THAT

00:57:38.722 --> 00:57:41.325 region:rollup2
IS IS THAT'S WHERE THE INSURERS

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:44.261 region:rollup2
CAN PUT.

00:57:41.325 --> 00:57:46.229 region:rollup2
IN INCREMENTS OF RATE THAT THEY

00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:48.231 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO DEAL

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:50.067 region:rollup2
WITH CATASTROPHES LIKE THE ONE

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:52.135 region:rollup2
THAT HAS OCCURRED HERE AND SO

00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:53.870 region:rollup2
THERE IS A A COMPONENT OF RATE

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:55.305 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT. AT THAT A

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:59.810 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATES.

00:57:55.305 --> 00:58:00.310 region:rollup2
RATING BASED ON CATASTROPHIC

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:00.677 region:rollup2
EVENTS LIKE THE ONE THAT

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.312 region:rollup2
OCCURRED HERE.

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:03.981 region:rollup2
DO YOU ALSO REVIEW THEIR INCOME

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:06.149 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS HUMAN OR INCOME TAX

00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:07.651 region:rollup2
RETURNS AND THEIR BALANCE SHEETS

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:09.286 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AUDITED FINANCIAL

00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:11.121 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS TO. MAKE SURE THAT

00:58:09.286 --> 00:58:13.123 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT. CHARGING TOO MUCH

00:58:11.121 --> 00:58:13.724 region:rollup2
THEN IS AT PAR THE PROCESS WELL

00:58:13.123 --> 00:58:15.892 region:rollup2
WE WE.

00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:17.361 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THE RATES AT THE

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:19.629 region:rollup2
FILE.

00:58:17.361 --> 00:58:21.098 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT OTHER A FINANCIAL

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:24.067 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

00:58:21.098 --> 00:58:25.202 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:26.870 region:rollup2
FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE

00:58:25.202 --> 00:58:29.439 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE ADEQUATELY

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:32.142 region:rollup2
RESERVING TO PAY FUTURE CLAIMS.

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:33.910 region:rollup2
AND SO WE DO A LOOK AT THEIR

00:58:32.142 --> 00:58:36.079 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:38.248 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR BY THE AMOUNT OF

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:40.384 region:rollup2
RESERVES AND WE LOOK AT THEIR

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:42.152 region:rollup2
RESERVES HAS MATCHED AGAINST

00:58:40.384 --> 00:58:43.186 region:rollup2
THEIR LIABILITIES TO MAKE SURE

00:58:42.152 --> 00:58:43.754 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE EVENT OF A

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.555 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC EVENT LIKE THIS

00:58:43.754 --> 00:58:47.324 region:rollup2
ONE.

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:49.192 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY RESERVE TO

00:58:47.324 --> 00:58:49.793 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO PAY CLAIMS AND I WILL

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:50.961 region:rollup2
TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS

00:58:49.793 --> 00:58:53.563 region:rollup2
A.

00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:56.133 region:rollup2
AN ENORMOUS AND DEVASTATING.

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:57.434 region:rollup2
SERIES OF OF OF THE

00:58:56.133 --> 00:59:00.303 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHES TWELVE OVER TWELVE

00:58:57.434 --> 00:59:00.604 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL LOSSES

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:01.004 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTING.

00:59:00.604 --> 00:59:02.572 region:rollup2
.

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:04.408 region:rollup2
THAT OBVIOUSLY FALLS ON DEFERRED

00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:06.009 region:rollup2
INSURERS IN DIFFERENT WAYS GIVEN

00:59:04.408 --> 00:59:08.145 region:rollup2
THEIR DEGREE OF EXPOSURE SOME

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:09.413 region:rollup2
INSURERS ARE HAVING MORE OF THAT

00:59:08.145 --> 00:59:11.782 region:rollup2
LOST SOME LAST.

00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:15.085 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE.

00:59:11.782 --> 00:59:15.719 region:rollup2
FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT BASED ON

00:59:15.085 --> 00:59:17.754 region:rollup2
OUR WORK.

00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:19.456 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT COMPANIES ARE

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:20.657 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY RESERVED THAT THEY'LL

00:59:19.456 --> 00:59:21.958 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO PAY THOSE CLAIMS.

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:24.728 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:26.363 region:rollup2
RESERVES TO PAY THE CLAIMS.

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:27.964 region:rollup2
WE WERE GIVING UP YET SHEET THAT

00:59:26.363 --> 00:59:29.666 region:rollup2
SHOWS THAT FROM NINETY ONE TO

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:30.333 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:31.435 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF INSURANCE

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:32.903 region:rollup2
COMPANIES HAS GONE FROM A

00:59:31.435 --> 00:59:34.571 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE DOWN TO

00:59:32.903 --> 00:59:36.139 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SEVEN.

00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:37.707 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M WONDERING WHAT PROP

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:39.009 region:rollup2
ONE A THREE BE PART OF THE

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:40.510 region:rollup2
PROVINCES THAT PASSED IN EIGHTY

00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:42.979 region:rollup2
EIGHT. IT RECEIVED FORTY FOUR

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:44.948 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE INSURERS JUST

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:46.650 region:rollup2
LEAVE THE STATE.

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:48.618 region:rollup2
OR WAS IT MERGERS OR WAS IT

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:50.220 region:rollup2
ACTUAL BANKRUPTCIES WELL I I

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:52.622 region:rollup2
I'VE I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.890 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF PAPER

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:54.524 region:rollup2
IN HIS SOURCE BUT. THERE. IT'S

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.859 region:rollup2
YOURS

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:57.494 region:rollup2
YEAH.

00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:59.229 region:rollup2
IT'S MINE.

00:59:57.494 --> 01:00:00.831 region:rollup2
GREAT.

00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.966 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR ME

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:04.801 region:rollup2
TO DISAVOW IT ISN'T IT.

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:05.168 region:rollup2
YEAH. I GUESS I AM FAMILIAR WITH

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:07.504 region:rollup2
IT.

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:08.805 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WHAT HAS OCCURRED OVER

01:00:07.504 --> 01:00:10.974 region:rollup2
THAT PERIOD OF TIME ARE.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:13.343 region:rollup2
SERIES OF CONSOLIDATIONS IN

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:16.847 region:rollup2
MERGERS OF COMPANIES.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:18.348 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:20.650 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:21.184 region:rollup2
FACTOR EXPLAINING THAT THAT

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.653 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:25.355 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT WE

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:27.190 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HAVE COMPETITION IN

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:27.991 region:rollup2
THE MARKET AS I MENTIONED A

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.494 region:rollup2
MOMENT AGO.

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:32.295 region:rollup2
WE WERE SUCCESSFUL UNDER MY

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:33.697 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER SHIPPAN AS GETTING

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:34.898 region:rollup2
ALL STATE TO RETURN BACK TO THE

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:36.533 region:rollup2
MARKET AFTER HE'D PULLED OUT

01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:38.168 region:rollup2
ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:39.169 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A BIG. THAT WAS A BIG

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:41.738 region:rollup2
PLUS BUT THERE HAS BEEN

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:42.205 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION WITHIN

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.106 region:rollup2
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.941 region:rollup2
GENERALLY.

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:46.643 region:rollup2
I'M A FAIR PLAN. IT THAT'S AN

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:49.246 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANY ITSELF RIGHT

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:50.147 region:rollup2
WOULD DO WE HAVE A SEPARATE

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:50.380 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FOR THAT NOW DO WE.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.015 region:rollup2
DO THE.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.383 region:rollup2
THE BALANCE SHEET INCOME

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.651 region:rollup2
STATEMENT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.352 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH RESERVES.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.687 region:rollup2
SO.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:59.956 region:rollup2
MORE PRECISELY IN A IN I DIDN'T

01:00:57.687 --> 01:01:02.826 region:rollup2
SAY THIS IN MY REMARKS BECAUSE A

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:05.028 region:rollup2
READING OF TIME A. THE FAIR PLAY

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.997 region:rollup2
AND THE FAIR PLAN. THE FAIR PLAN

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:08.765 region:rollup2
NOW IS ACTUALLY INNOCENT USUALLY

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:11.001 region:rollup2
TO TAKE CARE DINNER WILL

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:14.638 region:rollup2
STICKERS FOR AYE AYE FOR DINNER.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:15.138 region:rollup2
I WAS TRYING TO BE MINDFUL BUT

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:15.872 region:rollup2
THE BUT THE FAIR FLED.

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:18.608 region:rollup2
THE FAIR PLAN IS ACTUALLY.

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:20.577 region:rollup2
IN ASSOCIATION AND ALL OF THE

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:22.312 region:rollup2
WRITERS OF PROPERTY INSURANCE

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:23.780 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN IT.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:25.515 region:rollup2
HITS

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:29.052 region:rollup2
STATUTORILY.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:30.620 region:rollup2
CREATED A IT IS REGULATED BY

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:32.122 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.491 region:rollup2
WE PERFORM THE SAME.

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:37.527 region:rollup2
RATE REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:39.162 region:rollup2
SOLVENCY REVIEW FOR IT AS WE

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:41.998 region:rollup2
PERFORM FOR.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:44.734 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE ADMITTED THAT

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:46.369 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL MARKET. LIKE A JPA.

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:47.938 region:rollup2
I YEAH I GUESS I MEAN I THINK

.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:58.154 region:rollup2
THAT I'D COLLECTING MORE MORE

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:59.756 region:rollup2
DETAILED INFORMATION WITH REGARD

TO LOS EXPERIENCE.

01:05:59.756 --> 01:06:04.561 region:rollup2
AND THEN BEING ABLE TO USE THAT.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:07.163 region:rollup2
IN A MORE SPECIFIC WAY FOR

PURPOSES OF RATING.

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:12.468 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WOULD OCCURS THE IN SOME

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:14.771 region:rollup2
CASES WITH SOME. CARRIERS RATE

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:16.873 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT IS THEY MAY NOT HAVE

01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:18.808 region:rollup2
ENOUGH EXPERIENCE.

01:06:16.873 --> 01:06:20.610 region:rollup2
AN OF CREDIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT I

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:22.212 region:rollup2
TO USE AN ACTUARIAL TERM.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:24.814 region:rollup2
IN THEIR OWN.

ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITING IN

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:36.192 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS SO THEY

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:37.527 region:rollup2
THEN USE OTHER SOURCES OF

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:39.229 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE PUT

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:41.264 region:rollup2

LONG AS IT'S A CREDIBLE WILL

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:50.874 region:rollup2
ALLOW THAT BUT WE THINK. THAT BE

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:53.977 region:rollup2
SOME REAL BENEFIT IN ARE

01:06:50.874 --> 01:06:55.778 region:rollup2
COLLECTING MORE DETAILED A LOS

ENTIRE CALIFORNIA MARKET IS SO

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:01.317 region:rollup2
SHE WOULD WILD FIRES. SO THAT.

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:02.585 region:rollup2
WE WOULD THEN HAVE THAT

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:04.988 region:rollup2

01:07:04.988 --> 01:07:09.559 region:rollup2
MORE REFINED. A JOBLESS RATE

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:12.161 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THAT SPECIFIC TO

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:14.597 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IF THEY DON'T HAVE

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:15.231 region:rollup2
ENOUGH OF THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:16.766 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO RATES OF THEY'RE

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:17.901 region:rollup2
STILL THEY'RE STILL WRITING IN

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:19.235 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK FIRE IS MAYBE NOT A

01:07:17.901 --> 01:07:21.237 region:rollup2
WHOLE LOT THEY HAVEN'T HAD A LOT

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:22.205 region:rollup2
OF LOSSES. SO WHEN THEY DEVELOP

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:24.541 region:rollup2
THEIR RATES THEY DON'T HAVE

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.108 region:rollup2
ENOUGH A DATA POINTS TO HAVE

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.242 region:rollup2
CREDIBLE EXPERIENCE SO THEN

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:27.644 region:rollup2
THEY.

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:29.546 region:rollup2
USE EXPERIENCE FROM THESE OTHER

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:31.047 region:rollup2
SOURCES AND SOME OF THESE OTHER

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:32.582 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.816 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE CALIFORNIA'S

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:36.853 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC.

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:39.322 region:rollup2
AND MAY NOT BE AS.

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:40.523 region:rollup2
ROBUST TO REFINE THE DATA SAID

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:43.993 region:rollup2
AS WE THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:43.993 region:rollup2
ATTACK OBTAINED BY ACTUALLY

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.397 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE DATA. IF I IF I SAID

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:49.666 region:rollup2
ANYTHING WRONG YOU CAN CORRECT

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:50.934 region:rollup2
ME BUT. I THINK THAT'S THE GIST

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:51.968 region:rollup2
OF IT THE AND THAT IS NOT

01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:53.536 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S TYPICALLY DONE

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:55.338 region:rollup2
IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:56.973 region:rollup2
ASSESSING THEIR. THEIR RATES THE

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:59.208 region:rollup2
RATES THEY'RE PROPOSING WELL

01:07:56.973 --> 01:08:00.109 region:rollup2
AGAIN WHAT'S DIFFERENT WHAT'S

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:02.178 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IS.

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:04.047 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME NUMBER OF

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:07.617 region:rollup2
CARRIERS WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:08:04.047 --> 01:08:09.986 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AND ARE USING THIRD

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:11.020 region:rollup2
PARTY DATA SETS TIGHTER AND YEAH

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:12.956 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THAT THAT THAT COULD

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.257 region:rollup2
HAPPEN LAST YEAR. AND THE YEAR

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.458 region:rollup2
BEFORE IN OTHER WORDS IS NOT

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:15.959 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S DONE IN THE

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.460 region:rollup2
NORMAL COURSE OF YOUR A

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:18.695 region:rollup2
REVIEWER.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.829 region:rollup2
WELL WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT THAN

01:08:18.695 --> 01:08:21.397 region:rollup2
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT IT IS

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:26.202 region:rollup2
THAT WE BE COLLECTING AT ONE

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:26.836 region:rollup2
TIME. CARRIES DON'T COME IN

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:27.403 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR THEY MAY COME IN YEAR

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:27.971 region:rollup2
ONE

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:28.605 region:rollup2
LINE AND THAT CAN THAT NOT

01:08:27.971 --> 01:08:29.272 region:rollup2
COMING FOR RATE FILING TO YEAR

01:08:28.605 --> 01:08:31.741 region:rollup2
FOUR. AND SO IT SORT OF ALL OVER

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:33.376 region:rollup2
THE PLACE AND SO WE HAVE BITS OF

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:34.577 region:rollup2
DATA FOR DIFFERENT PERIODS OF

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:36.245 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:38.281 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DATA THAT SPECIFIC TO

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:39.816 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CARRIERS BUT WE DON'T

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:42.051 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A COLLECTED IN ONE PLACE

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:42.986 region:rollup2
ALL THE DATA FOR A GIVEN YEAR.

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.754 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD LET US HAVE A

01:08:42.986 --> 01:08:46.089 region:rollup2
COMPLETE PICTURE AND THAT WE

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:47.357 region:rollup2
COULD THEN USE AND FRANKLY THE

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:48.658 region:rollup2
CARRIERS COULD USE TO DO AND I

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.792 region:rollup2
AND I SUSPECT I MEAN THE BENEFIT

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:50.960 region:rollup2
OF THIS TO THE CARRIAGE FRANKLY

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.128 region:rollup2
IS FOR THOSE CARRIERS THAT ARE A

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.496 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT WRITING

01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:55.131 region:rollup2
MORE HIGH. RISK FIRES BECAUSE IN

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:58.101 region:rollup2
A LOT EXPERIENCE THERE THIS DATA

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.835 region:rollup2
SAID COULD PROVIDE MORE COMFORT

01:08:58.101 --> 01:09:00.503 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THEM.

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:01.871 region:rollup2
WERE LEASE FOR COMFORT WITH

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:04.507 region:rollup2
REGARD TO WHAT THE APPROPRIATE

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:05.408 region:rollup2
PRICING IS TO ENABLE THEM TO

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:06.509 region:rollup2

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:53.169 region:rollup2
THOSE COUNTIES THERE ALSO ALL.

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:53.836 region:rollup2
LARGELY LOW INCOME COMMUNITY

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:56.439 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:58.040 region:rollup2
IF YOU GO BY THE DEFINITION

01:12:56.439 --> 01:12:59.308 region:rollup2
UNDER AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THOSE

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.710 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE VERY LARGE SWATHS

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:03.546 region:rollup2
OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:06.148 region:rollup2
COUNTIES LIKE TRINITY AND LAKE

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:07.416 region:rollup2
AND SIERRA AND. CAN YOU MONO AND

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:10.519 region:rollup2
MARIPOSA.

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:11.587 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE A HOMEOWNER

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:13.222 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEING COUNSELOR NON

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:14.490 region:rollup2
RENEWED AND THEY'RE GOING OUT

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.591 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR THEIR COVERAGE.

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:17.860 region:rollup2
AND THEIR HAVING TO GO TO A

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.394 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT IS UP TO TWICE AS

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:18.694 region:rollup2
MUCH AS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.962 region:rollup2
PAYING.

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:22.098 region:rollup2
.

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:22.765 region:rollup2
IT'S COVERAGE.

01:13:22.098 --> 01:13:25.735 region:rollup2
BUT IS IT AFFORDABLE AND

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:28.571 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE NO PROBABLY NOT.

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:30.873 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S ALSO NOT JUST AN

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:32.808 region:rollup2
ISSUE OUT IN THE STICKS AS WE

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:34.677 region:rollup2
MIGHT THINK ABOUT WHERE THE FIRE

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:37.213 region:rollup2
RISK AREAS ARE. WE'VE BEEN

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:38.914 region:rollup2
SEEING HOMEOWNERS IN PLACES LIKE

01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:41.150 region:rollup2
AUBURN WHERE THEY ARE WITHIN A

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:41.751 region:rollup2
MILE OR TWO OF A FIRE STATION

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.485 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STREET FROM A FIRE

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:44.186 region:rollup2
HYDRANT.

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:45.721 region:rollup2
I GET CANCELED A NON RENEWED

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:47.056 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN HIGH FIRE

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:49.725 region:rollup2
RISK AREA.

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:51.494 region:rollup2
SO IT NEEDS ARE NOT THESE ARE

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:52.928 region:rollup2
BECOMING MORE COMMON ITS NOT

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:55.031 region:rollup2
UNIQUE TO THOSE FOLKS OUT IN THE

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:56.565 region:rollup2
REMOTE AREAS. AND AS WE SEE THE

01:13:55.031 --> 01:13:58.467 region:rollup2
SORTS OF HIGH SEVERITY

01:13:56.565 --> 01:14:00.469 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC.

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:02.204 region:rollup2
DAMAGING WILDFIRES EXPAND OUT

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:04.407 region:rollup2
INTO AREAS SUCH AS SENATOR

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:06.809 region:rollup2
JACKSON'S DISTRICT.

01:14:04.407 --> 01:14:08.344 region:rollup2
WE FEAR THE EXPANSION OF THE

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:10.313 region:rollup2
CANCELLATIONS ARE NOT RENTALS.

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:11.847 region:rollup2
AND SO WELL AFFORDABILITY IS A

01:14:10.313 --> 01:14:12.949 region:rollup2
GREAT CONCERN WE ALSO HAVE ONE

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:14.450 region:rollup2
OTHER GREAT CONCERN AT THE

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.518 region:rollup2
COUNTY LEVEL.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.586 region:rollup2
AND THAT BEING.

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:18.988 region:rollup2
OR THE.

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:21.057 region:rollup2
THAT CONCERN OF PEOPLE BEING

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:23.059 region:rollup2
ABLE TO. HAVE THE VALUE OF THEIR

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:24.327 region:rollup2
HOMES HOMES THAT CAN GET

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:25.828 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COVERAGE BECOME A LOT

01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:27.330 region:rollup2
LESS VALUABLE.

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:29.131 region:rollup2
AND AS OUR HOME VALUES DROPPED

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:32.468 region:rollup2
IN OUR RURAL COUNTIES.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:34.837 region:rollup2
IT. TAKES DOWN OUR OUR TAXATION.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:37.039 region:rollup2
ABILITY AS WELL AND SO CAN WE

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:39.709 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SERVICES AT A LEVEL THAT

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:40.910 region:rollup2
OUR. CONSTITUENTS ARE USED TO IF

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:42.078 region:rollup2
WE ARE FOR PROPERTY TAXES GO

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:44.046 region:rollup2
DOWN.

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:45.648 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN COLLECT SO THAT IS A

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:47.383 region:rollup2
GREAT CONCERN FOR OUR MEMBER

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:48.818 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AS WELL I THINK SHOULD

01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:50.986 region:rollup2
BE FOR COUNTIES ALL OVER THE

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:53.255 region:rollup2
STATE THAT ARE GOING TO BE. AT

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:56.025 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM SO.

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:57.093 region:rollup2
WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I I

01:14:56.025 --> 01:14:58.361 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO MUCH ABOUT

01:14:57.093 --> 01:15:00.529 region:rollup2
THE TIERED RISK

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:02.431 region:rollup2
MODEL BECAUSE MATTHEW COVERED

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:04.333 region:rollup2
MOST VETS SO. HE DID MY JOB FOR

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:05.801 region:rollup2
ME BUT ARE COUNTIES WERE VERY

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.636 region:rollup2

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:08.604 region:rollup2
MODEL WITH A CALIFORNIA THROUGH

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:10.506 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS AND WITH THE

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:11.774 region:rollup2
INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE. WE ALL

WORK TOGETHER AND HELD HANDS AND

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:14.777 region:rollup2
AND WHERE DEVELOPING THAT DRAFT

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:16.312 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

01:15:14.777 --> 01:15:17.713 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A TIERED RISK

01:15:16.312 --> 01:15:19.548 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR HOMEOWNERS.

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:20.383 region:rollup2
THESE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE BEING

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:22.151 region:rollup2
CANCELED A NON RENEWED THEY'RE

01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:23.119 region:rollup2
NOT OUT THERE NOT DOING THEIR

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:24.353 region:rollup2
DEFENSIBLE SPACE ARE NOT FIRE

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:25.554 region:rollup2
HURTING THEIR HOMES SOME OF THEM

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:27.056 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.923 region:rollup2

PROTECTED FROM WILDFIRE.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:34.096 region:rollup2
SO IF WE'D LOVE TO SEE A

THE COMPANIES THAT CREATE AND

I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PRIVATE

KILEY WITH THE TREE MORTALITY

CRUCIAL PIECE TO SOLVE THIS

01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:52.007 region:rollup2
PUZZLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

01:26:51.473 --> 01:26:54.776 region:rollup2
AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS

01:26:52.007 --> 01:26:55.310 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:57.112 region:rollup2
INTERESTING.

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:58.380 region:rollup2
IN MY CORRECT THEN THAT WHAT

01:26:57.112 --> 01:26:59.915 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT THE

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:02.150 region:rollup2
REASON FOR A LOT OF THESE

01:26:59.915 --> 01:27:03.852 region:rollup2
CHANGES IS THAT. THEY'RE NOT

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:06.354 region:rollup2
USING OF PREDICTIVE.

01:27:03.852 --> 01:27:08.323 region:rollup2
MODELING INSTEAD OF THE MORE

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:10.625 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL APPROACHES.

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:11.960 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT YA OUR

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:14.529 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION IS THAT THAT IS

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:17.866 region:rollup2
DRIVING A LOT OF A LOT OF THE.

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:19.267 region:rollup2
CONTRACTION IN THE MARKET.

01:27:17.866 --> 01:27:21.536 region:rollup2
KATE AND IN IS THAT WHAT IS YOUR

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:23.004 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE RATIONALE

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:24.439 region:rollup2
FOR DOING IT IN THIS FASHION.

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:25.841 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK IT USED TO BE THE

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:27.442 region:rollup2
CASE THAT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR

01:27:25.841 --> 01:27:29.444 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SEND

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:30.545 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY OUT TO INSPECT PROPERTY

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:31.113 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO ENSURE

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:32.114 region:rollup2
WHEN IT CAME UP FOR RENEWAL

01:27:31.113 --> 01:27:33.648 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:27:32.114 --> 01:27:35.717 region:rollup2
WITH A LARGE INSURANCE MARKET

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:37.352 region:rollup2
I'M YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE ISN'T

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:38.720 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE PRACTICE AND SO THIS

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:39.788 region:rollup2
IS A. SORT OF.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.424 region:rollup2
LARGER.

01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:43.925 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:45.594 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT LARGE NUMBERS OF

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:47.062 region:rollup2
HOMES AND LOOKING AT ZIP CODES

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:48.296 region:rollup2
AND AND OTHERS TO PRICE AND

01:27:47.062 --> 01:27:49.598 region:rollup2
ASSESS THE RISK.

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:51.800 region:rollup2
AND ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IT'S

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:53.435 region:rollup2
LESS ACCURATE OR JUST MORE

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.937 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE TO THE HOMEOWNER.

01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:57.239 region:rollup2
WELL IT IT IT IS LESS ACCURATE

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:59.307 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE THAT THE MODELS

01:27:57.239 --> 01:28:00.876 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES ONLY FACTOR IN. THE

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:01.977 region:rollup2
RISK.

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:04.112 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THE

01:28:01.977 --> 01:28:06.114 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS DOING OR WHAT THE

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:08.517 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MIGHT BE DOING TO.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:10.252 region:rollup2
PREVENT OR MITIGATE THE IMPACTS

01:28:08.517 --> 01:28:12.354 region:rollup2
OF FIRES AND SO WHEN THEY'RE

01:28:10.252 --> 01:28:13.655 region:rollup2
USED WITHOUT LOOKING AT

01:28:12.354 --> 01:28:14.890 region:rollup2
MITIGATION OR WHAT WITHOUT

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:16.858 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT LOCAL FIREFIGHTING

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:18.727 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE OR. OTHER THINGS

01:28:16.858 --> 01:28:20.428 region:rollup2
THAT COMMUNITIES MIGHT HAVE DONE

01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:22.364 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK THAT DAY I'M.

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:24.466 region:rollup2
MAYBE OVERSTAY RISK OR AT LEAST

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:25.033 region:rollup2
REPRESENT RISK WITHOUT LOOKING

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:28.537 region:rollup2
AT THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:30.372 region:rollup2
REALLY BORN.

01:28:28.537 --> 01:28:31.673 region:rollup2
.

01:28:30.372 --> 01:28:33.241 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP ON THE CHAIRS QUESTION

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.576 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOESN'T THE MARKETPLACE

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:36.444 region:rollup2
KIND OF BALANCE THAT OUT SO

01:28:34.576 --> 01:28:37.078 region:rollup2
LET'S JUST SAY YOU'RE RIGHT OKAY

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.213 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:39.314 region:rollup2
RIGHT OR WRONG.

01:28:38.213 --> 01:28:42.884 region:rollup2
BOB BUT LET'S JUST SAY YOU'RE

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:43.185 region:rollup2
RIGHT. I DOZEN ANOTHER INSURANCE

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:44.052 region:rollup2
COMPANY SAY.

01:28:43.185 --> 01:28:45.720 region:rollup2
HAY.

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:47.823 region:rollup2
MY COMPETITOR HERE IS WRITING

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.724 region:rollup2
ADD UP POLICY PREMIUM THAT'S

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:51.526 region:rollup2
MUCH HIGHER THAN. BASED ON OUR

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:53.295 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND LOOK AT THINGS WE

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:54.663 region:rollup2
CAN WE CAN UNDERCUT THAT WITH

01:28:53.295 --> 01:28:56.097 region:rollup2
REASONABLE RISK THAT WE THINK

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:57.899 region:rollup2
WE'RE WILLING TO UNDERTAKE. AS A

01:28:56.097 --> 01:29:00.035 region:rollup2
DOZEN THE MARKETPLACE KIND OF

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:01.369 region:rollup2
BALANCE THAT OUT OVER TIME.

01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:03.238 region:rollup2
WELL THAT THAT MAY HAPPEN IN IN

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:04.840 region:rollup2
SOME INSTANCES BUT I I THINK

01:29:03.238 --> 01:29:06.842 region:rollup2
THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT THERE'S

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:08.443 region:rollup2
ENOUGH. ELISE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:09.778 region:rollup2
ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:11.079 region:rollup2
GATHERED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:29:09.778 --> 01:29:12.614 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE PLACES IN

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:15.784 region:rollup2
WHICH THERE WON'T BE SOMETHING

01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:17.452 region:rollup2
TO FILL. THAT GAP IF IF ONE.

01:29:15.784 --> 01:29:19.721 region:rollup2
SURE IS EASY THEY'RE CHARGING UP

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:21.456 region:rollup2
A PREMIUM THIS ON AFFORDABLE OR

01:29:19.721 --> 01:29:22.824 region:rollup2
OR DECIDING TO LEAVE AN AREA.

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:24.726 region:rollup2
HOME COMPLETELY I THINK THAT'S

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:26.027 region:rollup2
WHAT THE FLORIDA STORY IS AS IT

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:27.395 region:rollup2
I THINK TELLING IN THAT REGARD

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.963 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE WERE A LOT OF

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.598 region:rollup2
ENSURES THAT LEFT THE MARKET

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:31.166 region:rollup2
AND.

01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:32.834 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE YOU KNOW

01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:33.969 region:rollup2
THEN THEN PEOPLE START PAYING

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:35.403 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE.

01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:36.972 region:rollup2
AND DID YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:38.106 region:rollup2
BEYOND ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT

01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:40.709 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE LEAVING

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:41.910 region:rollup2
THE MARKET.

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:43.612 region:rollup2
WELL I I THINK THAT THE

01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:45.413 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF

01:29:43.612 --> 01:29:46.781 region:rollup2
DATA THAT WE HAVE SURVEY DATA

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:48.516 region:rollup2
THAT WE COLLECTED.

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:50.018 region:rollup2
AS AN ORGANIZATION.

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:51.786 region:rollup2
VOTE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:29:50.018 --> 01:29:53.722 region:rollup2
THAT WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:55.657 region:rollup2
IS GATHERING MORE DATA SO THAT

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:56.524 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET AND ACT MORE ACCURATE

01:29:55.657 --> 01:29:57.993 region:rollup2
PICTURE OF THE OF THE PROBLEM

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:59.961 region:rollup2
BUT. THE COMPLAINTS THAT WERE

01:29:57.993 --> 01:30:00.896 region:rollup2
RECEIVING AS AN ORGANIZATION AND

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:02.564 region:rollup2
AND THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:03.698 region:rollup2
ABLE TO COLLECT ON IN THE

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:05.300 region:rollup2
OAKLAND HILLS AND. IN SOME OF

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:06.635 region:rollup2
THE RURAL COUNTIES I'M DOES

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:09.037 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT THAT THIS IS

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:09.971 region:rollup2
BECOMING A PROBLEM OKAY BECAUSE

01:30:09.037 --> 01:30:11.640 region:rollup2
I'M INTERESTED AS YOU ARE.

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.807 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S AGAIN THIS

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.210 region:rollup2
BALANCING ACT OF THAT WE WENT

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:16.611 region:rollup2
OVER REGULATED MARKETPLACE THAT.

01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:18.647 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO SELF CORRECT.

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:20.849 region:rollup2
WITHOUT GOVERNMENT GET IN THE

01:30:18.647 --> 01:30:22.317 region:rollup2
WAY OR. DO WE NEED TO STEP IN TO

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:24.152 region:rollup2
PROTECT CONSUMERS AND TO CREATE

01:30:22.317 --> 01:30:24.686 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:25.820 region:rollup2
MARKET THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:30:24.686 --> 01:30:27.088 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY.

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.957 region:rollup2
HERE'S HOW I GUESS OF A WHAT'S

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:30.592 region:rollup2
INTERESTING WITH THAT IS THE

01:30:28.957 --> 01:30:32.027 region:rollup2
FACT IT IS AT ALL STATE TO OUR

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:34.029 region:rollup2
STATE FARM ONE OF THE MARKETS

01:30:32.027 --> 01:30:34.963 region:rollup2
WAS GONE FOR A DECADE IS NOW

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:39.267 region:rollup2
COME BACK.

01:30:34.963 --> 01:30:40.535 region:rollup2
AND KICK IS HER ANY OF IT.

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.703 region:rollup2
THERE IS OBVIOUSLY THIS CONCERN

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:43.371 region:rollup2
THAT IGNORING THEORY MARKET

01:30:41.703 --> 01:30:45.840 region:rollup2
BASED

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:48.576 region:rollup2
PA PROGRAMS WORK BECAUSE THE

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.879 region:rollup2
COMPETITION AND THE ABILITY TO.

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:52.547 region:rollup2
TO SORT OF MOVE INTO OUR AVOID

01:30:50.879 --> 01:30:55.717 region:rollup2
AND TO BE ABLE TO.

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:57.686 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE INSURANCE AND AND

01:30:55.717 --> 01:31:00.956 region:rollup2
TO REAP THE REWARDS.

01:30:57.686 --> 01:31:02.524 region:rollup2
OFFSET SIR COUNTERS THE THE.

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:04.759 region:rollup2
A OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS SENATE

01:31:02.524 --> 01:31:07.696 region:rollup2
IS A QUESTION IT'S REGULATION TO

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:09.097 region:rollup2
PROTECT US OF OR. AND I GET IN

01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:10.932 region:rollup2
THE WAY SO WHAT IS IT WHAT ARE

01:31:09.097 --> 01:31:12.834 region:rollup2
YOUR THOUGHTS. PARTICULARLY ON

01:31:10.932 --> 01:31:14.369 region:rollup2
THIS SPRING ON THIS SPECIFIC

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:16.204 region:rollup2
SUBJECT AND FOLLOWING UP THE

01:31:14.369 --> 01:31:18.773 region:rollup2
QUESTION SENT BOTH THE SENATE

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:20.375 region:rollup2
GLAZER NIGHT IT JUST PASSED.

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:22.310 region:rollup2
WELL AND I THINK THAT LIKE I

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:23.311 region:rollup2
SAID IN MY TESTIMONY WE WE WOULD

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.980 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SEE A PRIVATE MARKET

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:26.314 region:rollup2
SOLUTION WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.483 region:rollup2
THE INSURANCE MARKET CORRECT

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:30.485 region:rollup2
ITSELF WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:32.320 region:rollup2
ENSURES RECOGNIZING MITIGATION

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:34.089 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.056 region:rollup2
ON THE SOMEWHAT UNIFORM BASIS

01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:36.958 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS A LOT OF THE WORK

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:37.559 region:rollup2
IN THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:39.361 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:31:37.559 --> 01:31:41.029 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET TO THIS IDEA OF IS

01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:42.897 region:rollup2
THEIR UNIFORM SET OF STANDARDS

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:44.632 region:rollup2
THAT. YOU KNOW MOST OR ALL

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:46.267 region:rollup2
CARRIERS WOULD AGREE TO THAT

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:48.536 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE A HOME INSURABLE FOR

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:50.005 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT. I MEAN.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:51.506 region:rollup2
HELLFIRE MENTION THIS IN THEIR

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:53.575 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY THAT THEY.

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:54.809 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES THEY'LL GO OUT TO

01:31:53.575 --> 01:31:56.511 region:rollup2
A PROPERTY AND DEL.

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:57.846 region:rollup2
DO AN INSPECTION AND IF THE

01:31:56.511 --> 01:32:00.081 region:rollup2
INSPECTION COMES BACK.

01:31:57.846 --> 01:32:01.449 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW COMPLIANT THAT

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:03.551 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL SAY. OH

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:05.186 region:rollup2
OKAY I THINK WE WE WILL ACTUALLY

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:05.787 region:rollup2
RENEW THAT POLICY BUT WHAT WE'RE

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:07.722 region:rollup2
SEEING MORE AND MORE IS THA

01:32:05.787 --> 01:32:10.191 region:rollup2
THAT ISN'T HAPPENING IN SO THERE

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:11.860 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE. SOME GREATER LEVEL

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:14.229 region:rollup2
OF SPECIFICITY OF WHAT THE

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:15.830 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER CAN DO IN ORDER TO

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:17.232 region:rollup2
KEEP THEIR INSURANCE OR KEEP IT

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:18.867 region:rollup2
AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE.

01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:20.568 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WE TRIED TO GET

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:22.637 region:rollup2
THERE AND I THINK THE REASON WHY

01:32:20.568 --> 01:32:25.407 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:28.476 region:rollup2
GET THERE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS

01:32:25.407 --> 01:32:29.811 region:rollup2
AND. ALL. OLIVEIRENSE INDICATES

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:30.845 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW THE FAIR PLAN

01:32:29.811 --> 01:32:32.280 region:rollup2
POLICIES ARE GROWING A LITTLE

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:33.915 region:rollup2
BIT AND SURPLUS LINES ARE

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.183 region:rollup2
GROWING A LITTLE BIT. AND THE

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:37.419 region:rollup2
NON ADMITTED MARKET'S SHRINKING

01:32:35.183 --> 01:32:38.420 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT AND I THINK BEFORE

01:32:37.419 --> 01:32:39.087 region:rollup2
IT GETS TO BE.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:41.189 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT AND THAT WE

01:32:39.087 --> 01:32:42.924 region:rollup2
WANNA.

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:43.458 region:rollup2
TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:45.026 region:rollup2
MY LAST QUESTION THAT YOU

01:32:43.458 --> 01:32:47.562 region:rollup2
TALKED.

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:48.997 region:rollup2
EARLIER ABOUT THE DESIRE TO

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:51.366 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE DATA.

01:32:48.997 --> 01:32:53.368 region:rollup2
ARE YOU FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO

01:32:51.366 --> 01:32:53.968 region:rollup2
GET THAT DATA ARE THE INSURANCE

01:32:53.368 --> 01:32:55.904 region:rollup2
COMPANIES REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:58.073 region:rollup2
IT.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:59.574 region:rollup2
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:01.443 region:rollup2
THINK SHOULD I SHOULD BE A

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:03.845 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT LEGISLATION

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:05.480 region:rollup2
WOULD OFFER OR. IS IT JUST THAT

01:33:03.845 --> 01:33:07.082 region:rollup2
THE THE DATA HASN'T BEEN

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.817 region:rollup2
COLLECTED I MEAN IS IS THERE A

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:10.318 region:rollup2
DATA ISSUE.

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:11.653 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK THERE'S THERE'S TWO

01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:13.054 region:rollup2
SIDES OF IT ARE THE OMMISSIONER

01:33:11.653 --> 01:33:14.889 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:16.257 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF. DATA

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:18.326 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGHER RISK

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:19.994 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATIONS THAT NO ONE

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:22.530 region:rollup2
INSURER SEEMS TO HAVE ENOUGH LAS

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:23.998 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO KNOW YOU

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:25.600 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE RISKS REALLY IS

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:27.435 region:rollup2
AND SO. THEY'RE SORT OF PIECING

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.337 region:rollup2
THAT TOGETHER AND I THINK THE

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:31.473 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE ALL OF A

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:32.407 region:rollup2
REAL SENSE OF OF THAT PICTURE

01:33:31.473 --> 01:33:33.975 region:rollup2
AYE THERE AND THEY WOULDN'T THEY

01:33:32.407 --> 01:33:36.544 region:rollup2
HAVE ASKED TO HAVE MORE OF THAT

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:38.746 region:rollup2
DATA. THE SECOND PART OF IT IS.

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:40.482 region:rollup2
I THINK ON A GRANULAR LEVEL WE

01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:42.650 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO

01:33:40.482 --> 01:33:45.086 region:rollup2
MONITOR YOU KNOW BY COUNTY OR BY

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:45.653 region:rollup2
ZIP CODE OR HIGH RISK AREA HOW

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:47.155 region:rollup2
WE DEFINE HOWEVER WE DEFINE

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:49.390 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:33:47.155 --> 01:33:51.059 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE IN THE FARE PLAN

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:52.660 region:rollup2
POLICY COUNT THE INCREASE IN THE

01:33:51.059 --> 01:33:53.194 region:rollup2
NON ADMITTED MARKET AND THAT

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.596 region:rollup2
DECREASES IN THE ADMITTED

01:33:53.194 --> 01:33:56.631 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:33:54.596 --> 01:33:58.833 region:rollup2
AND THAT DATA IS YOU KNOW IT IS

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:59.968 region:rollup2
COLLECTED IN SOMETIMES BUT I

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.835 region:rollup2
THINK IT IS DIFFICULT AND I

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:02.237 region:rollup2
THINK THE DEPARTMENT.

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:03.605 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE

01:34:02.237 --> 01:34:05.740 region:rollup2
RESOURCES OR.

01:34:03.605 --> 01:34:08.576 region:rollup2
AND THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T ALWAYS

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:09.577 region:rollup2
HAVE THE APPETITE TO PROVIDE.

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:11.146 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT ISSUES OF

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:12.614 region:rollup2
COURSE THE SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO

01:34:11.146 --> 01:34:14.249 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE THAT APPETITE

01:34:12.614 --> 01:34:16.317 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO FORCE IT

01:34:14.249 --> 01:34:17.752 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES. YOU SHOULD MAKE

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:18.853 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LEAVE IF THEY DON'T WANT

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:20.788 region:rollup2
TO. SO.

01:34:18.853 --> 01:34:21.389 region:rollup2
A.

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.590 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT DOES IT IN TERMS

01:34:21.389 --> 01:34:24.959 region:rollup2
OF.

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:27.795 region:rollup2
.

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:30.598 region:rollup2
MY QUESTIONS ON YOUR AND.

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:34.035 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY DID HAVE ONE QUESTION

01:34:30.598 --> 01:34:34.736 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE FOR. MS A.

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:37.839 region:rollup2
I HINTON.

01:34:34.736 --> 01:34:39.741 region:rollup2
THE A.

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:41.809 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A NUMBER

01:34:39.741 --> 01:34:43.244 region:rollup2
OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.546 region:rollup2
THAT YOU REPRESENT.

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:46.447 region:rollup2
.

01:34:44.546 --> 01:34:49.184 region:rollup2
HAS THERE BEEN ANY EFFORT TO TRY

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:50.685 region:rollup2
TO PULL LOCAL RESOURCES TO

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:53.188 region:rollup2
CREATE THEIR OWN KIND OF SELF.

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:54.856 region:rollup2
INSURANCE

01:34:53.188 --> 01:34:57.325 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS SET SOMETHING THAT'S

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:58.660 region:rollup2
BEEN CONSIDERED.

01:34:57.325 --> 01:35:00.895 region:rollup2
BITS OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:02.897 region:rollup2
TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IT CERTAINLY

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.898 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION.

01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:06.367 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE'VE QUITE

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:08.503 region:rollup2
GOTTEN THAT FAR YET BUT YEAH I

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:09.971 region:rollup2
KNOW THE IDEA IS OUT THERE AND

01:35:08.503 --> 01:35:11.439 region:rollup2
AT SOME I MEAN WE.

01:35:09.971 --> 01:35:13.208 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WOULD EXPORT ANYTHING

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:14.709 region:rollup2
HERE IF IT IF IT HELPED OUR

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:16.110 region:rollup2
FOLKS OUT SO THAT'S THAT IS AN

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:17.645 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE.

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:18.746 region:rollup2
WE JUST HAVEN'T QUITE GOTTEN

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:19.948 region:rollup2
THAT FAR YET.

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:21.783 region:rollup2
I DO ONLY COUNTIES WORKING ON

01:35:19.948 --> 01:35:23.918 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WERE CUT JUSTIN

01:35:21.783 --> 01:35:25.787 region:rollup2
INTERESTING POSSIBILITY AND AND

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:28.990 region:rollup2
LASTLY FOR.

01:35:25.787 --> 01:35:30.692 region:rollup2
ACHIEVER CARMEN THE YEAH.

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:32.360 region:rollup2
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTL WE

01:35:30.692 --> 01:35:33.561 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:35.863 region:rollup2
THE BIG PROBLEM WITH THE MUTUAL

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:38.366 region:rollup2
AID SYSTEM IS THAT THERE'S RED

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:40.401 region:rollup2
TAPE THE DELAYS THE ABILITY OF

01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:43.137 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TO WORK TOGETHER AND WE

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:45.106 region:rollup2
DID HEAR THE IN SOME INSTANCES.

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:45.974 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DIFFERENT. GROUPS

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:48.343 region:rollup2
OF THE HECK WITH THERE WERE JUST

01:35:45.974 --> 01:35:48.876 region:rollup2
GOING TO CALL YOU UP AND WILL

01:35:48.343 --> 01:35:50.178 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE OF THE PAPERWORK

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:52.013 region:rollup2
LATER.

01:35:50.178 --> 01:35:53.848 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T IT MY NURSING IS THAT'S

01:35:52.013 --> 01:35:56.551 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THE

01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:58.519 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS. ANOTHER IS

01:35:56.551 --> 01:36:00.955 region:rollup2
THE THE FACT THAT IT TAKES SO

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:02.557 region:rollup2
LONG TO GET OTHER AGENCIES

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:04.659 region:rollup2
RESPONDING AND THAT WHICH YOU

01:36:02.557 --> 01:36:06.894 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE. WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE

01:36:04.659 --> 01:36:08.363 region:rollup2
ONCE WE GET A LOOK AT.

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:10.398 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE WHAT FOURTEEN

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:11.833 region:rollup2
RED FLAG DAYS IN A ROW KNOWING

01:36:10.398 --> 01:36:13.735 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COULD VERY LIKELY

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:15.236 region:rollup2
CAUSE FIRES AND. THE THOMAS FIRE

01:36:13.735 --> 01:36:17.105 region:rollup2
WHIC IS ONE OF I THINK FIVE

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:18.706 region:rollup2
THAT TOOK PLACE ALL AT THE SAME

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:20.608 region:rollup2
TIME. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:22.644 region:rollup2
CHISUM'S COMMISSAR NEVER WENT

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:23.211 region:rollup2
OUT PRESS OF THEM THEY WERE ABLE

01:36:22.644 --> 01:36:25.346 region:rollup2
TO PUT OUT.

01:36:23.211 --> 01:36:27.148 region:rollup2
WITH IT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:29.917 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD. LIKE TO SEE.

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:30.952 region:rollup2
YES BY THE THE FUNDING YOU

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:31.452 region:rollup2
THINK WOULD BE A CRITICAL

01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:34.422 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF ALL OF THAT

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:36.591 region:rollup2
ABILITY.

01:36:34.422 --> 01:36:37.625 region:rollup2
TO PRIYA OF PRE STAGED PRE

01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:40.261 region:rollup2
POSITION.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:41.195 region:rollup2
IN CASES WHERE YOU'RE HAVING

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:44.766 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF EXTREME WEATHER

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:45.900 region:rollup2
THAT'S HIGHLY LIKELY TO CREATE A

01:36:44.766 --> 01:36:48.369 region:rollup2
FIRE PROBLEMS.

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:49.871 region:rollup2
I YEAH I DO I THINK COME AGAIN

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:51.072 region:rollup2
AT THAT THE SYSTEM IS SIXTY

01:36:49.871 --> 01:36:52.640 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD AND CERTAINLY THE

01:36:51.072 --> 01:36:54.275 region:rollup2
FIRES JUST IN MY CAREER OF

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.977 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE YEARS THE FIRES HAVE

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:57.512 region:rollup2
CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY.

01:36:55.977 --> 01:36:59.480 region:rollup2
IN THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY'RE

01:36:57.512 --> 01:37:02.216 region:rollup2
DEVOURING YOU KNOW PROPERTY AND

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.217 region:rollup2
LAND. SO FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:37:02.216 --> 01:37:04.752 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I MENTIONED EARLIER

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:06.187 region:rollup2
THAT WERE OPERATING NOW WITH

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:07.288 region:rollup2
FEWER FIRE RESOURCES THAN EVER

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:09.657 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:11.492 region:rollup2
WE'RE MAKING MORE REQUESTS FOR

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:12.927 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO THE MUTUAL AID

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:15.396 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAN EVER BEFORE AND

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:17.165 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING MORE UNFILLED

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:18.833 region:rollup2
RESOURCE ORDERS THAN EVER BEFORE

01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:20.301 region:rollup2
SO TO BE ABLE TO PUT THESE

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:22.503 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ON THE ROAD. I THINK

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:23.805 region:rollup2
CHIEF PIMLOTT THAT THE DIRECTOR

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:25.206 region:rollup2
OF CAL FIRE MENTIONED EARLIER.

01:37:23.805 --> 01:37:26.708 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL IS TO ALWAYS TRYING

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:28.409 region:rollup2
KEEP THESE INCIDENTS AS SMALL AS

01:37:26.708 --> 01:37:30.411 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE AND WE CAN ONLY DO THAT

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:31.946 region:rollup2
WITH RESOURCES.

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:34.349 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN IF THE RESOURCES.

01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:36.017 region:rollup2
AREN'T ABLE TO KEEP THEM SMALL

01:37:34.349 --> 01:37:37.485 region:rollup2
WE CAN RE DIRECT THESE AND AS

01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:38.519 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED THAT SHE FOR

01:37:37.485 --> 01:37:41.022 region:rollup2

THE MUD SLIDES AB THAT'S A GREAT

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:48.296 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WE

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:50.064 region:rollup2
CAN SAVE AND HOW MUCH SHE EVEN

01:37:48.296 --> 01:37:51.699 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN SAVE THE PROPERTY THAT

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:54.035 region:rollup2
THE LIVES THAT WE SAVED BY THE

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:54.202 region:rollup2
PRE POSITIONING THOSE RESOURCES

01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:02.196 region:rollup2
LEARNING PROCESS FOR THEM.

01:39:59.894 --> 01:40:03.831 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE TAKING ALL OF

01:40:02.196 --> 01:40:04.699 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:06.434 region:rollup2

CHANGE

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.205 region:rollup2

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:13.174 region:rollup2
THE PAST AND THEY WANT TO BE AT

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:14.141 region:rollup2
THE TABLE. IN ANY OF THOSE

01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:16.010 region:rollup2

01:49:01.702 --> 01:49:05.005 region:rollup2
THE LOW USE OF THE CALIFORNIA

INSURER. WILL NOT RENEW THEM

01:49:20.354 --> 01:49:23.757 region:rollup2
THEY CANNOT FIND COVERAGE ON

THEY CANNOT FIND COVERAGE WITH

01:49:25.859 --> 01:49:28.595 region:rollup2
THE BIG NAME INSURER.

01:49:26.727 --> 01:49:30.264 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS ARE FINDING INSURANCE

01:49:28.595 --> 01:49:31.198 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN THE MIDMARKET.

01:49:30.264 --> 01:49:32.699 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT WILL REQUIRE

01:49:31.198 --> 01:49:35.235 region:rollup2
SHOPPING AROUND TO GETTING THIS

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:37.104 region:rollup2
DISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT AGENT OR

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:38.539 region:rollup2
BROKER AS YOU'LL HEAR LATER ON.

01:49:37.104 --> 01:49:40.774 region:rollup2
OR SEVEN JURORS CHOOSING NOT TO

RENEW IN CERTAIN AREAS YES

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:45.679 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME OTHER

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:47.181 region:rollup2
INSURERS ARE WRITING THEIR RISK.

01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:48.549 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY IMPORTANT REASONS

01:49:47.181 --> 01:49:50.083 region:rollup2
WHY SOME INSURERS MAY NOT BE

01:49:48.549 --> 01:49:51.618 region:rollup2
ABLE TO RENEW ALL THEIR

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:52.686 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS.

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:54.588 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT

01:49:52.686 --> 01:49:56.090 region:rollup2
WANT THE BUSINESS IMPACT ONE MY

01:49:54.588 --> 01:49:58.492 region:rollup2
LARGE CARRIERS TELLS ME THAT IT

01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:59.059 region:rollup2
TAKES FOUR TIMES AS LONG AND

01:49:58.492 --> 01:50:00.194 region:rollup2
FOUR TIMES THE COST TO GET A

01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:01.762 region:rollup2

01:50:00.194 --> 01:50:02.830 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER AS IT DOES TO KEEP A

01:50:01.762 --> 01:50:04.498 region:rollup2
CURRENT ONE.

01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:06.166 region:rollup2
BUT INSURERS NEED TO RESPONSIBLY

01:50:04.498 --> 01:50:07.167 region:rollup2
MANAGE AND SPREAD THEIR RISKS SO

01:50:06.166 --> 01:50:09.203 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE THERE FOR ALL OF

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:10.904 region:rollup2
THEIR CUSTOMERS.

01:50:09.203 --> 01:50:13.707 region:rollup2
A BIG ISSUE WITH RESPECTIVE L.

01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:15.309 region:rollup2
ABILITY IS OVER EXPOSURE. IF

01:50:13.707 --> 01:50:16.944 region:rollup2
INSURANCE OVER EXPOSED IN A

01:50:15.309 --> 01:50:18.045 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR HIGH RISK AREA THAT

01:50:16.944 --> 01:50:19.847 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO LOWER THE

01:50:18.045 --> 01:50:22.783 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION PREVENT FINANCIAL

01:50:19.847 --> 01:50:25.119 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT FROM ONE MAJOR FIRE.

01:50:22.783 --> 01:50:27.221 region:rollup2
IT'S PRO FINANCIAL SOLVENCY RISK

01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:28.889 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ENSURES THAT INSURERS

01:50:27.221 --> 01:50:30.324 region:rollup2
CAN KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO ALL

01:50:28.889 --> 01:50:31.592 region:rollup2
OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.

01:50:30.324 --> 01:50:32.960 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE HER DEPENDING

01:50:31.592 --> 01:50:34.795 region:rollup2
ON THEM.

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.096 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:50:34.795 --> 01:50:37.698 region:rollup2
WERE ONE INSURER MAY NEED TO

01:50:36.096 --> 01:50:39.466 region:rollup2
PREVENT OVER CONCENTRATION IN

01:50:37.698 --> 01:50:40.634 region:rollup2
THE AREA. THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:42.736 region:rollup2
INSURANCE WITH LESS

01:50:40.634 --> 01:50:43.804 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION RISK HAVE STEPPED

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:45.172 region:rollup2
INTO THE MARKET TO ADDRESS

01:50:43.804 --> 01:50:46.440 region:rollup2
CONSUMER NEEDS.

01:50:45.172 --> 01:50:48.609 region:rollup2
IN A COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.077 region:rollup2
THIS WILL CONTINUE.

01:50:48.609 --> 01:50:51.478 region:rollup2
SOME INSURERS ALSO NEED TO RENEW

01:50:50.077 --> 01:50:52.846 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WHERE THE

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:55.449 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DOES NOT

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:56.650 region:rollup2
PERMIT PERMIT AN ADEQUATE RATE.

01:50:55.449 --> 01:50:57.951 region:rollup2
BECAUSE INSURERS ARE PRICE

01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:59.386 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED BY THE STATE THEY

01:50:57.951 --> 01:51:01.054 region:rollup2
MUST REACT TO RATE SUPPRESSION

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:03.323 region:rollup2
BY REDUCING THEIR EXPOSURE TO

01:51:01.054 --> 01:51:05.159 region:rollup2
RISKY AREAS OR BE FORCED HAVE

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:08.061 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE

01:51:05.159 --> 01:51:08.562 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZED RISKY AREAS.

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:10.030 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR

01:51:08.562 --> 01:51:11.532 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY.

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:13.800 region:rollup2
JUSTIFIABLY HOMEOWNERS IT

01:51:11.532 --> 01:51:14.334 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE DOES COSTS

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.435 region:rollup2
BORNE RISKIER AREAS OF THE

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:16.870 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:19.039 region:rollup2
WE WOULD EXPECT THIS BECAUSE THE

01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:20.741 region:rollup2
PRICE MUST RELIEF REFLECT THE

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:22.276 region:rollup2
RISK IN ORDER TO PAY CLAIMS. TO

01:51:20.741 --> 01:51:24.077 region:rollup2
DO OTHERWISE WOULD AND FAIRLY

01:51:22.276 --> 01:51:26.079 region:rollup2
RESULT HOMEOWNERS IN OTHER AREAS

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:27.548 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE SUBSIDIZING THOSE

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:28.682 region:rollup2
CHOOSING TO LIVE IN RISKIER

01:51:27.548 --> 01:51:30.484 region:rollup2
AREAS.

01:51:28.682 --> 01:51:31.385 region:rollup2
HONG CHURNS RATES MUST BE

01:51:30.484 --> 01:51:32.819 region:rollup2
APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:51:31.385 --> 01:51:34.621 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND MUST BE ACCURATELY

01:51:32.819 --> 01:51:35.956 region:rollup2
SOUND CANNOT BE INADEQUATE

01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:37.858 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE OR UNFAIRLY

01:51:35.956 --> 01:51:38.926 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATORY.

01:51:37.858 --> 01:51:40.060 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE'S

01:51:38.926 --> 01:51:40.928 region:rollup2
WHITE PAPER QUESTIONS

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:42.396 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY OF HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:51:40.928 --> 01:51:43.797 region:rollup2
RATES

01:51:42.396 --> 01:51:45.332 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:47.134 region:rollup2
MISS PRE APPROVAL HOMEOWNER

01:51:45.332 --> 01:51:48.936 region:rollup2
INSURANCE RATES INCLUDING THE

01:51:47.134 --> 01:51:52.973 region:rollup2
FAIR PLAN IN THE CALIFORNIA

01:51:48.936 --> 01:51:54.174 region:rollup2
BEFORE INSURERS CAN USE THEM.

01:51:52.973 --> 01:51:55.375 region:rollup2
SOME OF SUGGESTED UP TO I DO

01:51:54.174 --> 01:51:57.711 region:rollup2
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS THAT

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:59.046 region:rollup2
MITIGATION EFFORTS SHOULD BE

01:51:57.711 --> 01:52:00.547 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED TO ADJUST RATES.

01:51:59.046 --> 01:52:02.783 region:rollup2
IT IS DIFFICULT WERE RATES ARE

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:04.318 region:rollup2
ALREADY INADEQUATE. REGARDLESS

01:52:02.783 --> 01:52:06.086 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT

01:52:04.318 --> 01:52:07.421 region:rollup2
MEDICATION IS JUST ONE PART OF

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:08.522 region:rollup2
THE EQUATION.

01:52:07.421 --> 01:52:10.023 region:rollup2
MANY FACTORS GO INTO THE

01:52:08.522 --> 01:52:11.792 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITING OF RISK IN ADDITION

01:52:10.023 --> 01:52:14.595 region:rollup2
TO MEDICATION INCLUDING

01:52:11.792 --> 01:52:17.297 region:rollup2
VEGETATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE

01:52:14.595 --> 01:52:18.565 region:rollup2
PREDOMINANT CONCERN. ROAD ACCESS

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:19.833 region:rollup2
AND SLOW.

01:52:18.565 --> 01:52:22.502 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE FACTORS CANNOT BE

01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:23.604 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED EVEN WITH MEDICATION.

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:25.606 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE RECENT

01:52:23.604 --> 01:52:27.207 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES HELLFIRE COULD NOT

01:52:25.606 --> 01:52:28.242 region:rollup2
DRIVE DOWN CERTAIN CLOTHES SOCKS

01:52:27.207 --> 01:52:29.576 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T WIDE ENOUGH

01:52:28.242 --> 01:52:31.545 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO TURN

01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:33.513 region:rollup2
THEIR ENGINES AROUND.

01:52:31.545 --> 01:52:35.549 region:rollup2
STILL INJURIES GENERALLY SUPPORT

01:52:33.513 --> 01:52:37.251 region:rollup2
HOME SPECIFIC AND COMMUNICATE

01:52:35.549 --> 01:52:38.619 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MITIGATION EFFORTS.

01:52:37.251 --> 01:52:40.287 region:rollup2
INSURERS AT BUNDY COMMUNITY

01:52:38.619 --> 01:52:41.855 region:rollup2
EFFORTS FOR MANY YEARS THROUGH

01:52:40.287 --> 01:52:43.690 region:rollup2
GRANTS TO FIRE CITY COUNCILS

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:45.092 region:rollup2
EMPIRE WHITES COMMUNITIES.

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:46.493 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO SUPPORT MORE STRINGENT

01:52:45.092 --> 01:52:47.494 region:rollup2
BUILDING SANDERS WITH FIRE

01:52:46.493 --> 01:52:49.396 region:rollup2
RESISTANT MATERIALS AND

01:52:47.494 --> 01:52:50.597 region:rollup2
TECHNIQUES. HOWEVER THERE ARE

01:52:49.396 --> 01:52:51.932 region:rollup2
LIMITS TO THE ABILITY OF

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:54.501 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES TO

01:52:51.932 --> 01:52:55.068 region:rollup2
PROTECT HOMES WHEN CONFRONTED

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:55.902 region:rollup2
WITH THE MAJOR UNCONTROLLED

01:52:55.068 --> 01:52:57.437 region:rollup2
FIRE.

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:59.640 region:rollup2
WITH ALL THAT IN SANTA ROSA I

01:52:57.437 --> 01:53:00.807 region:rollup2
ALSO WAS RECENTLY AT A TRIMMERS

01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:03.210 region:rollup2
HOLLY TASK FORCE.

01:53:00.807 --> 01:53:05.746 region:rollup2
MEETING WHERE CAL FIRE PRESENTED

01:53:03.210 --> 01:53:07.080 region:rollup2
AND. SHOWED DIFFERENT AREAS OF

01:53:05.746 --> 01:53:09.249 region:rollup2
THE CULT OF THE SENATE AS AN ART

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:11.018 region:rollup2
BAY FIRES. ON THE SHOULD ONE

01:53:09.249 --> 01:53:12.753 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF A FIRE WISE COMMUNITY

01:53:11.018 --> 01:53:15.122 region:rollup2
THAT SURVIVED AND ONE THAT DID

01:53:12.753 --> 01:53:16.223 region:rollup2
NOT AND SO WHEN I ASKED.

01:53:15.122 --> 01:53:17.291 region:rollup2
KELP WIRED.

01:53:16.223 --> 01:53:18.525 region:rollup2
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT LITIGATION

01:53:17.291 --> 01:53:20.394 region:rollup2
IS AT WORK IN THE SAID PAUL

01:53:18.525 --> 01:53:21.828 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT DOES AND SOMETIMES

01:53:20.394 --> 01:53:23.230 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T?

01:53:21.828 --> 01:53:24.164 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:53:23.230 --> 01:53:25.666 region:rollup2
WANT TO SUPPORT PEOPLE

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:27.768 region:rollup2
MITIGATING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:53:25.666 --> 01:53:29.169 region:rollup2
HELP BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:53:27.768 --> 01:53:30.771 region:rollup2
PROVIDE DISCOUNTS ESPECIALLY

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:32.506 region:rollup2
THOSE INADEQUATE RATES.

01:53:30.771 --> 01:53:35.776 region:rollup2
FIRST SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT

01:53:32.506 --> 01:53:36.843 region:rollup2
WORK AS WELL.

01:53:35.776 --> 01:53:38.111 region:rollup2
BEFORE I CONCLUDE I FEEL

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:40.113 region:rollup2
COMPELLED I DO FEEL COMPELLED

01:53:38.111 --> 01:53:41.114 region:rollup2
THE COMMENT GENERALLY ON THE

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:42.983 region:rollup2
FACT THAT SEVENTY PIECE OF THE

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:44.785 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION HAD BEEN INTRODUCED

01:53:42.983 --> 01:53:46.019 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT MAY NOT

01:53:44.785 --> 01:53:47.220 region:rollup2
EXIST.

01:53:46.019 --> 01:53:48.455 region:rollup2
EVER HAVE A COMIC THAT I WILL

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:50.157 region:rollup2
COME AT THE MANY THESE COMMENTS

01:53:48.455 --> 01:53:51.658 region:rollup2
CONCEPTS PLACE SIGNIFICANT

01:53:50.157 --> 01:53:53.427 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:54.961 region:rollup2
INSURERS TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGING

01:53:53.427 --> 01:53:57.431 region:rollup2
BALANCE THEIR BUSINESS. AND

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:58.732 region:rollup2
COULD CAUSE A TRUE AVAILABILITY

01:53:57.431 --> 01:54:01.034 region:rollup2
CRISIS AND WE DON'T WANT.

01:53:58.732 --> 01:54:03.437 region:rollup2
IN AFTERMATH OF NORTHRIDGE

01:54:01.034 --> 01:54:05.572 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE. WE WE SAW WHAT COULD

01:54:03.437 --> 01:54:07.074 region:rollup2
HAPPEN STATE LAW MANDATED

01:54:05.572 --> 01:54:08.875 region:rollup2
INSURANCE TO OFFER EARTHQUAKE

01:54:07.074 --> 01:54:10.143 region:rollup2
COVERAGE EVERYTIME THEY SOLD

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:11.178 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY.

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:12.713 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THE NORTHRIDGE

01:54:11.178 --> 01:54:14.047 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE BEGAN

01:54:12.713 --> 01:54:16.283 region:rollup2
RESTRICTING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:17.584 region:rollup2
SALES IN THE STATE BECAUSE THEY

01:54:16.283 --> 01:54:18.885 region:rollup2
COULD NOT RESPONSIBLY CONTINUE

01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:21.188 region:rollup2
TO WRITE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE

01:54:18.885 --> 01:54:22.723 region:rollup2
POLICIES. AS THE PROBLEM MORE ON

01:54:21.188 --> 01:54:23.857 region:rollup2
THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY BEGAN

01:54:22.723 --> 01:54:26.093 region:rollup2
TO EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH

01:54:23.857 --> 01:54:27.527 region:rollup2
S. GROWS AND CALIFORNIA CONDOM

01:54:26.093 --> 01:54:29.229 region:rollup2
USE AFFECTED. THE STATE

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:31.031 region:rollup2
RESPONDED BY CREATING THE

01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:32.165 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY.

01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:33.734 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT THAN THE CALIBER

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:35.435 region:rollup2
AND DIFFERENT THAN CALIFORNIA

01:54:33.734 --> 01:54:37.838 region:rollup2
CREATED FAIR PLAN. BOTH SERVE

01:54:35.435 --> 01:54:39.106 region:rollup2
THE SAME PURPOSE OF ENSURING AN

01:54:37.838 --> 01:54:40.574 region:rollup2
OPTION THAT IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE

01:54:39.106 --> 01:54:41.842 region:rollup2
FOR PHONE MANNERS.

01:54:40.574 --> 01:54:43.510 region:rollup2
HOWEVER UNLIKE EARTHQUAKE

01:54:41.842 --> 01:54:45.645 region:rollup2
INSURANCE HERE THERE IS A

01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:46.413 region:rollup2
THRIVING PRIVATE MARKET FOR FIRE

01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:48.014 region:rollup2
INSURANCE THAT WE NEED TO

01:54:46.413 --> 01:54:49.649 region:rollup2
PRESERVE. RATHER THAN JEOPARDIZE

01:54:48.014 --> 01:54:50.083 region:rollup2
WITH LEGISLATION THAT COULD

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:51.518 region:rollup2
RESULT IN UNINTENDED

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:52.786 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

01:54:51.518 --> 01:54:54.254 region:rollup2
IN CONCLUSION CALIFORNIA'S

01:54:52.786 --> 01:54:56.289 region:rollup2
INSURANCE MARKET IS HEALTHY AND

01:54:54.254 --> 01:54:58.158 region:rollup2
VIABLE. INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE

01:54:56.289 --> 01:54:59.726 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN THIS

01:54:58.158 --> 01:55:01.528 region:rollup2
NEW NORMAL OF LONGER FIRE

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:03.296 region:rollup2

DROUGHT AND OUTDATED FORESTRY

01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:07.467 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. COMMITTEES

01:55:05.165 --> 01:55:08.635 region:rollup2
MAY NEED TO SHOP AROUND MORE BUT

01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:10.070 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE.

01:55:08.635 --> 01:55:11.238 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS INSURERS ARE ABLE TO

01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:12.639 region:rollup2
MANAGE THEIR RISK APPROPRIATELY

01:55:11.238 --> 01:55:14.107 region:rollup2
AND HAVE ADEQUATE RATES TO PAY

01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:15.675 region:rollup2
CLAIMS INSURERS WILL CONTINUE TO

01:55:14.107 --> 01:55:16.810 region:rollup2
WRITE IN THE STATE.

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:17.911 region:rollup2
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:19.913 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO COME TO

01:55:17.911 --> 01:55:21.081 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS TO INSURING THAT JUST

01:56:28.515 --> 01:56:31.451 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AVAILABILITY

01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:33.019 region:rollup2

IT WAS A PRETTY SCARY COUPLE

01:56:54.007 --> 01:56:55.976 region:rollup2
DAYS.

01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:57.811 region:rollup2

01:56:57.811 --> 01:57:00.480 region:rollup2
START BY CALISTOGA ROAD IT'S

01:56:59.179 --> 01:57:02.449 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH THE ORIGIN OF THE

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:04.484 region:rollup2
FIRE MY FATHER IN LAW LIVES UP

HE'S GOT MANZANITA AT THIS THIS

01:57:16.663 --> 01:57:20.166 region:rollup2

STREET AT ALL. AND.

01:57:24.004 --> 01:57:26.973 region:rollup2
HIS STRATEGY TO MINOR CHARGES

01:57:25.972 --> 01:57:28.308 region:rollup2
CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT US MOVE

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:29.709 region:rollup2
DOWN THROUGH.

01:57:28.308 --> 01:57:31.278 region:rollup2
THE VALLEY BACK UP TO FOUND

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:32.846 region:rollup2

01:57:40.954 --> 01:57:44.024 region:rollup2
THERE'S HUNDREDS TWO HUNDRED

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:46.259 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED FEET BETWEEN THESE

01:57:44.024 --> 01:57:48.461 region:rollup2
THESE VERY LARGE HOMES.

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:51.298 region:rollup2
THEN FOR WHICH WE GO DOWN

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:53.633 region:rollup2
ACROSS WANNA WANNA GET TO WITH

01:57:51.298 --> 01:57:56.202 region:rollup2
THE TOPS ARE WITH THE TYPES FIRE

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:56.870 region:rollup2
HITS COFFEE PARK.

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.570 region:rollup2
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD

01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:58.204 region:rollup2
HARDWORKING PEOPLE IT'S KIND OF

01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:59.039 region:rollup2
A STARTER COMMUNITY MAYBE FOR A

01:57:58.204 --> 01:57:59.873 region:rollup2
LOT OF PEOPLE NEW HOME BUYERS.

01:57:59.039 --> 01:58:00.073 region:rollup2
COULD BE HARD WORKING PEOPLE

01:57:59.873 --> 01:58:01.841 region:rollup2
LIVE.

01:58:00.073 --> 01:58:03.143 region:rollup2
LIVED AND STILL LIVING COFFEE

01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:04.210 region:rollup2
PARKING AND RETIREES ARE

01:58:03.143 --> 01:58:06.479 region:rollup2
DOWNSIZING.

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:07.747 region:rollup2
THE STRATEGY THERE IS REALLY

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:09.149 region:rollup2
KIND OF WHAT EVERYONE'S BEEN

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:10.817 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THAT'S PRICE THAT

01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:12.185 region:rollup2
ONE AFFORDABLE INSURANCE.

01:58:10.817 --> 01:58:14.621 region:rollup2
COFFEE PARK IS.

01:58:12.185 --> 01:58:16.089 region:rollup2
AN ABSOLUTE WONDERFUL PLACE TO

01:58:14.621 --> 01:58:18.458 region:rollup2
LIVE AS WE MOVE TO FOUND GROW

01:58:16.089 --> 01:58:20.126 region:rollup2
THE STRATEGY THERE IS NOT PRICE

01:58:18.458 --> 01:58:21.127 region:rollup2
IT'S COVERAGE THAT MIGHT WANT

01:58:20.126 --> 01:58:22.395 region:rollup2
ADMITTED MARKETS THEY MIGHT

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:23.830 region:rollup2
WANNA CALIFORNIA TOM SOUTH

01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:25.465 region:rollup2
COMPANY. BUT THEY HAVE

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:26.800 region:rollup2
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES AND IN

01:58:25.465 --> 01:58:29.469 region:rollup2
BED IN THE HOMEOWNERS THEY HAVE

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:31.204 region:rollup2
FINE ARTS JEWELRY PAINTINGS IT'S

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:32.772 region:rollup2
A VERY DIFFERENT POLICY THAN A

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:34.174 region:rollup2
STANDARD HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. THE

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:36.176 region:rollup2
IDEA RIGHT NOW THAT ONE SIZE

01:58:34.174 --> 01:58:37.777 region:rollup2
FITS ALL SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR IT

01:58:36.176 --> 01:58:39.179 region:rollup2
IS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:40.780 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE WITHIN THE RANK OF

01:58:39.179 --> 01:58:42.749 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ENSURE. TO WHAT THE

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:44.050 region:rollup2
SUPER STOCK COMPANIES TO ENSURE

01:58:42.749 --> 01:58:45.819 region:rollup2
THAT WE GET BACK TO MY FATHER IN

01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:47.387 region:rollup2
LAW AND HIS POOR STRATEGY MATT

01:58:45.819 --> 01:58:49.723 region:rollup2
DISASTER OF A STRUCTURE IS. HELD

01:58:47.387 --> 01:58:51.091 region:rollup2
HELD HELD TAKE ANYTHING ANY

01:58:49.723 --> 01:58:52.559 region:rollup2
SLOPPY COMPANIES WANT TO GET

01:58:51.091 --> 01:58:54.294 region:rollup2
THEM BECAUSE HE JUST NEEDS

01:58:52.559 --> 01:58:55.929 region:rollup2
COVERAGE AND HE'S GONNA PAY FOR.

01:58:54.294 --> 01:58:56.997 region:rollup2
FOR HIS ISOLATIONISM.

01:58:55.929 --> 01:58:58.999 region:rollup2
.

01:58:56.997 --> 01:59:00.567 region:rollup2
SO. WITH THAT SAID I THINK THAT.

01:58:58.999 --> 01:59:02.702 region:rollup2
.

01:59:00.567 --> 01:59:04.270 region:rollup2

IN A MATTER WILL MY FATHER LA

01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:17.417 region:rollup2

SCIENCE AND IT'S IT'S NOT

02:04:16.516 --> 02:04:19.719 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL YOU LOOK IT OVER THE

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:21.854 region:rollup2
YEARS WHERE. YOU KNOW COMPANIES

02:04:19.719 --> 02:04:23.523 region:rollup2
GET THERAPY KIND OF SPREAD OF

02:04:21.854 --> 02:04:24.958 region:rollup2
RISK OUT OF WHACK I MEAN.

02:04:23.523 --> 02:04:26.292 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE A

02:04:24.958 --> 02:04:29.028 region:rollup2

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:31.130 region:rollup2
RISK FEEL FOR SOLVENCY ISSUES

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:32.732 region:rollup2
ALSO FOR THE REINSURERS AND MOST

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:34.534 region:rollup2
THESE COMPANIES ARE.

02:04:32.732 --> 02:04:36.069 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY REINJURED ITEM

02:04:34.534 --> 02:04:37.370 region:rollup2
THAT GETS OUT OF WHACK SOMETIMES

02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:39.906 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE BIG

02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:40.440 region:rollup2
LOSS EVENTS PAR AGENTS OR

02:04:39.906 --> 02:04:41.941 region:rollup2
BROKERS ARE PUSHING THOSE

02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:43.976 region:rollup2
ENVELOPES WE WANT TO SELL

INSURANCE. SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS

02:04:43.976 --> 02:04:46.980 region:rollup2
COMPANIES HAVE TO BALANCE OUT IS

02:04:45.278 --> 02:04:48.548 region:rollup2
AS YOU'VE HEARD SOME COMPANIES

02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:50.216 region:rollup2
MOVE OUT AND OTHERS MOVE IN AND

02:04:48.548 --> 02:04:52.285 region:rollup2

02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:53.953 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY OUR WITNESSES CONVICT

02:04:52.285 --> 02:04:55.455 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.

02:04:53.953 --> 02:04:57.724 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HEARD.

02:04:55.455 --> 02:05:00.660 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT LAST WEEK I THINK

02:04:57.724 --> 02:05:00.660 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE OF THE BETTER HEARING.

02:05:00.727 --> 02:05:06.866 region:rollup2
IS JACKSON OF YOUR COMMITTEE

02:05:03.029 --> 02:05:09.902 region:rollup2
ABOUT INSURANCE RATES IN ABOUT I

02:05:06.866 --> 02:05:12.538 region:rollup2
THINK FROM A COMMISSIONER. A

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:14.841 region:rollup2
PICKER ABOUT COMPANIES.

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:18.678 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

02:05:14.841 --> 02:05:22.815 region:rollup2
LEAVING THE MARKETPLACE RISK

02:05:18.678 --> 02:05:23.716 region:rollup2
ARE CHARGING YOU KNOW

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:31.457 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL RATES.

02:05:23.716 --> 02:05:32.925 region:rollup2
ARE MULTIPLES OF OF RATES. WE

02:05:31.457 --> 02:05:34.193 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

02:05:32.925 --> 02:05:40.767 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:41.067 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S YOU'VE HEARD IT'S

02:05:40.767 --> 02:05:47.240 region:rollup2
A.

02:05:41.067 --> 02:05:50.743 region:rollup2
PAID A PRE APPROVAL RATE STATE

02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:54.747 region:rollup2
SO UNLESS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN IN

02:05:50.743 --> 02:05:56.916 region:rollup2
THE QUEUE GO

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:58.451 region:rollup2
TO ANOTHER CARRIER AND I CARRIER

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:59.585 region:rollup2
HAS A DIFFERENT RATE AT FIVE.

02:05:58.451 --> 02:06:01.053 region:rollup2
MIGHT WILL HAVE DIFFERENT

02:05:59.585 --> 02:06:02.622 region:rollup2
COVERAGES AND THAT TYPE OF THING

02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:04.457 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT REFLECTS THAT

02:06:02.622 --> 02:06:05.391 region:rollup2
THAT DIFFERENCE IN COVERAGE I

02:06:04.457 --> 02:06:07.527 region:rollup2
THINK THE LAST THING I WANT TO

02:06:05.391 --> 02:06:09.762 region:rollup2
SAY IS WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

02:06:07.527 --> 02:06:11.697 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF NOT CREATING AN

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:13.266 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY SITUATION IN

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:16.135 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHERE ONE WOULD KNOW

02:06:13.266 --> 02:06:18.337 region:rollup2
THE LIES HOPE EXIST EXAMPLE IS

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:20.073 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSIONERS RECENTLY

02:06:18.337 --> 02:06:20.673 region:rollup2
NOTIFIED INSURERS.

02:06:20.073 --> 02:06:21.974 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP IN MIND

02:06:20.673 --> 02:06:24.377 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL TAX

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:25.678 region:rollup2
RATES OF CHANGE FROM THIRTY FIVE

02:06:24.377 --> 02:06:27.513 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:29.515 region:rollup2
AND. HE CAN OR SHOULD COMEY IS

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:31.150 region:rollup2
COMING IN FOR A RATE REDUCTION

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:32.785 region:rollup2
HOLE AFTER BRING LOSSES LIKE

02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:35.021 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S PRETTY DAUNTING ON

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:36.756 region:rollup2
THE OTHERS ON THE OTHER HAND.

02:06:35.021 --> 02:06:39.392 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY TWO

02:06:36.756 --> 02:06:40.827 region:rollup2

02:06:39.392 --> 02:06:44.997 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN YOUR RE INSURANCE

02:06:40.827 --> 02:06:46.766 region:rollup2
RATES IS NOT A JUSTIFICATION TO

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:47.967 region:rollup2
SUPPORT A RATE INCREASE.

02:06:46.766 --> 02:06:49.101 region:rollup2
NO THE RETURNS RATES ARE GOING

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:51.003 region:rollup2
UP BY YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN

02:06:49.101 --> 02:06:52.271 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT THE COMBINATION

02:06:51.003 --> 02:06:54.807 region:rollup2
OF THOSE THINGS COULD BE. HILL

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:55.975 region:rollup2
LIKE THIRTY PERCENT SO DEAL THAT

02:06:54.807 --> 02:06:58.077 region:rollup2
MAY WELL CREATE THE KIND OF

02:06:55.975 --> 02:06:58.744 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY SITUATION WE DON'T

02:06:58.077 --> 02:07:00.313 region:rollup2

02:20:30.822 --> 02:20:33.458 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO WRITE ABOUT HALF OF

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:46.805 region:rollup2
THE DO YOU ADMITTED MARKET

TO THE.

02:20:50.008 --> 02:20:53.278 region:rollup2
TO THE SURPLUS MARKET.

02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:54.513 region:rollup2
THE MAIN RISK IS THE EITHER THE

02:20:53.278 --> 02:20:56.548 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE LOCATION.

02:20:54.513 --> 02:20:57.916 region:rollup2
OR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOME

02:20:56.548 --> 02:20:59.584 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIMES WE'LL SEE HOMES

02:20:57.916 --> 02:21:01.653 region:rollup2
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED OR

02:20:59.584 --> 02:21:04.423 region:rollup2
SEVERAL LOSSES USUALLY WATER

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:07.292 region:rollup2
LOSSES ARE ONES THAT. MAKE YOU

02:21:04.423 --> 02:21:08.327 region:rollup2
GO INTO A NON ADMITTED MARKET.

02:21:07.292 --> 02:21:10.595 region:rollup2
THAT'S A THAT'S FROM LOOKING FOR

02:21:08.327 --> 02:21:12.164 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD MAKE A HOME GO INTO

02:21:10.595 --> 02:21:12.798 region:rollup2
THE NON.

02:21:12.164 --> 02:21:15.834 region:rollup2
SAYS COULD.

02:21:12.798 --> 02:21:17.436 region:rollup2
UPDATES OF A HOME A LOT OF

02:21:15.834 --> 02:21:18.537 region:rollup2
TIMES IT WOULD SHAKE ROOF WILL

02:21:17.436 --> 02:21:19.571 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOW IT TO GO TO BE

02:21:18.537 --> 02:21:23.775 region:rollup2
ADMITTED MARKET.

02:21:19.571 --> 02:21:25.677 region:rollup2
AND THE LOCATION.

02:21:23.775 --> 02:21:27.212 region:rollup2
PATRICIA K. ARE SO I HAVE I DO

02:21:25.677 --> 02:21:28.880 region:rollup2
HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I I AM

02:21:27.212 --> 02:21:31.583 region:rollup2
SERVICE MISTER A NOR WOULD WHICH

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:33.819 region:rollup2
TO RESPOND TO THE SUGGESTION.

02:21:31.583 --> 02:21:35.387 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD OPEN UP THE STATE

02:21:33.819 --> 02:21:37.889 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THESE.

02:21:35.387 --> 02:21:40.692 region:rollup2
OTHER NON STATE BASED.

02:21:37.889 --> 02:21:42.461 region:rollup2
A MARKET SO OR I SHOULD SAY

02:21:40.692 --> 02:21:44.029 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO

02:21:42.461 --> 02:21:45.931 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE COMPETITION I GUESS

02:21:44.029 --> 02:21:47.499 region:rollup2
IS THE SUGGESTION. WELL I THINK

02:21:45.931 --> 02:21:49.267 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A VERY GOOD BALANCE

02:21:47.499 --> 02:21:50.602 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW AND.

02:21:49.267 --> 02:21:51.703 region:rollup2
IT WOULD SHOULD BUT IT INSURANCE

02:21:50.602 --> 02:21:53.105 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE BY AND LARGE

02:21:51.703 --> 02:21:54.906 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE WITH NOT ADMITTED%

02:21:53.105 --> 02:21:55.974 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE

02:21:54.906 --> 02:21:56.641 region:rollup2
THERE IS KIND OF A LINE THERE

02:21:55.974 --> 02:21:58.243 region:rollup2
ARE THAT.

02:21:56.641 --> 02:22:00.379 region:rollup2
THERE'S SEVERAL LINES OF

02:21:58.243 --> 02:22:00.712 region:rollup2
INSURANCE THAT EVERYBODY AGREES

02:22:00.379 --> 02:22:02.547 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:22:00.712 --> 02:22:04.516 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO ADMITTED COVERAGE

02:22:02.547 --> 02:22:05.917 region:rollup2
FOR SO THE COMMISSIONER ALLOWS.

02:22:04.516 --> 02:22:07.185 region:rollup2
AGENTS AND BROKERS TO PLACE

02:22:05.917 --> 02:22:09.388 region:rollup2
BUSINESS IN THOSE MARKETS

02:22:07.185 --> 02:22:10.489 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE DECLINATIONS ON THE

02:22:09.388 --> 02:22:13.058 region:rollup2
OTHER LINES THEY HAVE TO GET

02:22:10.489 --> 02:22:14.860 region:rollup2
DECLINATIONS AS INDICATED.

02:22:13.058 --> 02:22:17.396 region:rollup2
THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET IS A

02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:19.898 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL ZEAL SEGMENT OF THE

02:22:17.396 --> 02:22:23.435 region:rollup2
OVERALL MARKET AS. YOU KNOW TIM

02:22:19.898 --> 02:22:24.736 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED TO SO I AM REALLY

02:22:23.435 --> 02:22:27.205 region:rollup2
THERE'S A GREAT BALANCE THERE

02:22:24.736 --> 02:22:28.707 region:rollup2
NOW AND I THINK THAT. THE

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:31.943 region:rollup2
SURPLUS LINES MARKET MARKET

02:22:28.707 --> 02:22:34.646 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY SERVES THESE AND IT

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:38.150 region:rollup2
HILL SPECIALTY RIPS THINGS THAT

02:22:34.646 --> 02:22:42.354 region:rollup2
HE THERE ARE AROUND. HIM MULTI

02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:45.857 region:rollup2
SIT MULTI STATE RISKS I'M. YOU

02:22:42.354 --> 02:22:48.160 region:rollup2
KNOW LOVE YA HIGH HIGH RISK

02:22:45.857 --> 02:22:50.228 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY RISKS THAT THE

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:53.398 region:rollup2
ADMITTED MARKET HIM DOESN'T ONE

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:55.934 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO IT WE WE THINK THE

02:22:53.398 --> 02:22:56.468 region:rollup2
BOUNCE IS VERY GOOD AND THEY ARE

02:22:55.934 --> 02:22:58.670 region:rollup2
NOW IN THE PROTECTIONS ARE

02:22:56.468 --> 02:23:00.372 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:22:58.670 --> 02:23:02.908 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE OF THE WITNESSES

02:23:00.372 --> 02:23:05.310 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT THEY WERE

02:23:02.908 --> 02:23:08.914 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THE NOT ADMITTED

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:11.783 region:rollup2
MARKET BECAUSE THOSE COMPANIES

02:23:08.914 --> 02:23:15.720 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A STATE GUARANTEE

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:17.889 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION. ARE ACTUALLY VIEW

NO YOU KNOW IT IS ABOUT HERE IS

02:23:30.936 --> 02:23:34.306 region:rollup2
DESIRABILITY I MEAN ONE OF THE

02:23:32.671 --> 02:23:35.307 region:rollup2
THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT HERE ONE

02:23:34.306 --> 02:23:37.275 region:rollup2

POSITIONED IN SAINT.

02:24:58.557 --> 02:25:00.992 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF

02:24:59.624 --> 02:25:02.827 region:rollup2
HOMES.

02:25:00.992 --> 02:25:04.563 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE IN THE MULTIMILLION

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:06.364 region:rollup2
DOLLAR CATEGORY AND IN FACT

02:25:04.563 --> 02:25:07.866 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ARGUABLY SAVED A GOOD

02:25:06.364 --> 02:25:09.434 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE CITY SANTA

02:25:07.866 --> 02:25:11.169 region:rollup2

02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:17.976 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT FORTY

02:25:16.007 --> 02:25:19.377 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS SO BUT NO DOUBT

02:25:17.976 --> 02:25:21.379 region:rollup2
PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:25:19.377 --> 02:25:22.881 region:rollup2
CAN BE FACTORED IN PREVENTION IS

02:25:21.379 --> 02:25:24.182 region:rollup2
ALWAYS WORTH A POUND OF CURE. I

02:25:22.881 --> 02:25:25.650 region:rollup2
WOULD MENTION A MY UNDERSTANDING

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:26.985 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE REDUCTION IN THE

02:25:25.650 --> 02:25:28.486 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN

02:25:26.985 --> 02:25:29.254 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS AS MUCH.

02:25:28.486 --> 02:25:32.090 region:rollup2
IF NOT MORE DUE TO THE

02:25:29.254 --> 02:25:33.558 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION OF THE INDUSTRY.

02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:35.527 region:rollup2

WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT HOW

02:25:35.527 --> 02:25:38.697 region:rollup2
REGULATION IS DESTROYING THE

02:25:37.462 --> 02:25:39.998 region:rollup2
MARKET BUT THE MARKET SEEMS

02:25:38.697 --> 02:25:42.334 region:rollup2
RATHER ROTH BUSTED IN THE

02:25:39.998 --> 02:25:43.902 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION. PERHAPS AT YOU LET

02:25:42.334 --> 02:25:45.170 region:rollup2
OTHER COMPANIES IN THAT AREN'T

02:25:43.902 --> 02:25:46.738 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY REGULATED THAT

02:25:45.170 --> 02:25:48.773 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT COULD

02:25:46.738 --> 02:25:49.841 region:rollup2
AND ID EITHER SO I'M I'M TRYING

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:52.310 region:rollup2

02:29:17.315 --> 02:29:21.486 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET.

02:29:19.184 --> 02:29:23.621 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NOTHING.

02:29:21.486 --> 02:29:25.790 region:rollup2
SEE HERE MOVE ON.

02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:26.791 region:rollup2
UM EVERYTHING'S. AND I'M JUST

02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:28.193 region:rollup2
WONDERING WHAT SHOULD I BE

02:29:26.791 --> 02:29:29.828 region:rollup2
WORRIED ABOUT AS A LEGISLATOR

02:29:28.193 --> 02:29:31.863 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY AND WHAT

02:29:29.828 --> 02:29:34.999 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND.

02:29:31.863 --> 02:29:36.534 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:37.068 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO BE FOR FUN I'M

02:29:36.534 --> 02:29:38.436 region:rollup2
SPEAKING FOR THE INSURANCE

02:29:37.068 --> 02:29:40.038 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY DIVERT TALK ABOUT

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:41.706 region:rollup2
INSURANCE ISSUES BUT WHEN I LOOK

02:29:40.038 --> 02:29:43.041 region:rollup2
AT THIS PERSONALLY I THINK WE

02:29:41.706 --> 02:29:46.044 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON THE

02:29:43.041 --> 02:29:47.212 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT OF OUR FORESTS.

02:29:46.044 --> 02:29:48.780 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE ITEM I UNDERSTAND

02:29:47.212 --> 02:29:50.014 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN ABOUT SEVENTY OR

02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:52.383 region:rollup2
EIGHTY BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:29:50.014 --> 02:29:54.352 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED DEALING WITH FIRE.

02:29:52.383 --> 02:29:55.286 region:rollup2
THREE OF SEVENTEEN DEALING WITH

02:29:54.352 --> 02:29:58.189 region:rollup2
INSURANCE BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

02:29:55.286 --> 02:30:01.493 region:rollup2
A. FOLKS ARE LOOKING A LOT MORE

02:29:58.189 --> 02:30:02.560 region:rollup2
pANYONE ELSE.

02:30:01.493 --> 02:30:04.829 region:rollup2
AND JUST BECAUSE EARLIER EARLIER

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:06.798 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS THAT WE DON'T

02:30:04.829 --> 02:30:09.100 region:rollup2
CREATE AVAILABILITY SITUATION

02:30:06.798 --> 02:30:10.835 region:rollup2
WHERE ONE MAYBE DOESN'T EXIST

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:12.704 region:rollup2
AND. YOU KNOW BY ESSENTIALLY

02:30:10.835 --> 02:30:14.372 region:rollup2
INTO THE IMPOSING MANDATES ON

02:30:12.704 --> 02:30:15.506 region:rollup2
JURORS THAT THERE ARE TIME

02:30:14.372 --> 02:30:16.774 region:rollup2
RESPONDING TO.

02:30:15.506 --> 02:30:19.410 region:rollup2
HERE WE TALKED COULD TALK A

02:30:16.774 --> 02:30:21.179 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE. THE ISSUE

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:23.147 region:rollup2
OF REINSURANCE MEAN OFTENTIMES

02:30:21.179 --> 02:30:25.383 region:rollup2
THE SMALL COMPANIES.

02:30:23.147 --> 02:30:28.920 region:rollup2
I MEAN THERE COULDN'T HAVE

02:30:25.383 --> 02:30:30.421 region:rollup2
THEIR DIRECTED IN PART BY THEIR

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:32.857 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN

02:30:30.421 --> 02:30:33.658 region:rollup2
OBTAIN REINSURANCE I HAD ONE OF

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:35.660 region:rollup2
OTHER CLIENTS WHO TALKED ME

02:30:33.658 --> 02:30:38.763 region:rollup2
ABOUT. AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND

02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:40.932 region:rollup2
THREE FIRES THAT THEIR IMAGE

02:30:38.763 --> 02:30:43.768 region:rollup2
THEIR REINSURER ASKING DAY

02:30:40.932 --> 02:30:46.137 region:rollup2
CANCEL. THEY'LL SEVERAL THOUSAND

02:30:43.768 --> 02:30:48.106 region:rollup2
POLICIES ARE NOT RENEW SEVERAL

02:30:46.137 --> 02:30:50.108 region:rollup2
THOUSAND POLICY BECAUSE THE

02:30:48.106 --> 02:30:52.644 region:rollup2
REINSURER THOUGHT THEY WERE. YOU

02:30:50.108 --> 02:30:54.145 region:rollup2
KNOW OVER EXPOSED SO THEY DID

02:30:52.644 --> 02:30:57.782 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE POLICIES WERE

02:30:54.145 --> 02:31:00.151 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE

02:30:57.782 --> 02:31:02.086 region:rollup2
BUTTERMILK THAT'S THAT'S A

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:04.389 region:rollup2
FACTOR IN ALL THIS OR NOT

02:31:02.086 --> 02:31:07.825 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT. REINSURANCE IS A

02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:09.928 region:rollup2
WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON HEALED IT'S

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:14.632 region:rollup2
CRITICAL FOR COMPANIES TO HAVE

02:31:09.928 --> 02:31:15.533 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THAT AND AS I SAID

02:31:14.632 --> 02:31:16.501 region:rollup2
EARLIER WE DON'T HAVE.

02:31:15.533 --> 02:31:17.368 region:rollup2
GET WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT IN

02:31:16.501 --> 02:31:18.436 region:rollup2
THE RATE PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA

02:31:17.368 --> 02:31:20.405 region:rollup2
HAS A REASON TO SUPPORT A RATE

02:31:18.436 --> 02:31:21.673 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF RETURNS COSTS GO UP.

02:31:20.405 --> 02:31:22.840 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ENDED SAME TIME

02:31:21.673 --> 02:31:24.676 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE ASKED TO. IN A

02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:28.746 region:rollup2
REDUCED RATES BECAUSE OF FEDERAL

02:31:24.676 --> 02:31:30.882 region:rollup2
TAX LAWS YOU IN THE STATE.

02:31:28.746 --> 02:31:31.683 region:rollup2
YOU THINK YOU MANAGER.

02:31:30.882 --> 02:31:34.018 region:rollup2
BESIDES LIKE TO.

02:31:31.683 --> 02:31:35.887 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE YOUR OBSERVATION

02:31:34.018 --> 02:31:37.121 region:rollup2
ABOUT MANAGING OUR FORESTS I

02:31:35.887 --> 02:31:37.322 region:rollup2
HAVE A BILL ON THAT THIS YEAR.

02:31:37.121 --> 02:31:39.390 region:rollup2
HAD.

02:31:37.322 --> 02:31:41.359 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:42.594 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE. I THINK

02:31:41.359 --> 02:31:44.128 region:rollup2
THERE'S VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT

02:31:42.594 --> 02:31:46.764 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSING A LOT

02:31:44.128 --> 02:31:47.365 region:rollup2
OF THIS THESE WEATHER CONDITIONS

02:31:46.764 --> 02:31:48.533 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CREATING THE PROBLEM

02:31:47.365 --> 02:31:50.001 region:rollup2
SO.

02:31:48.533 --> 02:31:51.436 region:rollup2
I THINK ON ALL SIDES FROM ALL

02:31:50.001 --> 02:31:53.271 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES

02:31:51.436 --> 02:31:54.672 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

02:31:53.271 --> 02:31:56.774 region:rollup2
I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION THOUGH

02:31:54.672 --> 02:31:57.008 region:rollup2
I'M I'M STILL KIND OF PUZZLED.

02:31:56.774 --> 02:31:58.710 region:rollup2
NO THE.

02:31:57.008 --> 02:32:00.211 region:rollup2
.

02:31:58.710 --> 02:32:02.914 region:rollup2
THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE

02:32:00.211 --> 02:32:05.717 region:rollup2
DECIMATED INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND

02:32:02.914 --> 02:32:07.485 region:rollup2
I REMEMBER QUITE VIVIDLY AND.

02:32:05.717 --> 02:32:08.219 region:rollup2
DRIVING DOWN VENTURA BOULEVARD

02:32:07.485 --> 02:32:10.621 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

02:32:08.219 --> 02:32:11.789 region:rollup2
IN THE VALLEY YOU KNOW THE

02:32:10.621 --> 02:32:12.390 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN

02:32:11.789 --> 02:32:15.293 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AND THE RESIDENCES

02:32:12.390 --> 02:32:17.028 region:rollup2
OF.

02:32:15.293 --> 02:32:19.130 region:rollup2
PURCHASE GET OFF THEIR

02:32:17.028 --> 02:32:19.998 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONS AND HAD TO BE

02:32:19.130 --> 02:32:21.666 region:rollup2
REBUILT AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO.

02:32:19.998 --> 02:32:23.401 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THE THE NEW RISK OF

02:32:21.666 --> 02:32:25.503 region:rollup2
THESE?

02:32:23.401 --> 02:32:27.238 region:rollup2
NEARLY MEGA FIRES DIFFER FROM

02:32:25.503 --> 02:32:29.574 region:rollup2
THE RISK THAT WE SAW AFTER THE

02:32:27.238 --> 02:32:31.409 region:rollup2
NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WHEN THE

02:32:29.574 --> 02:32:33.111 region:rollup2
INSURANCE INDUSTRY WAS VIRTUALLY

02:32:31.409 --> 02:32:34.812 region:rollup2
DECIMATED HERE WE'RE HAVING

02:32:33.111 --> 02:32:36.981 region:rollup2
THESE MAJOR EVENTS AND YET. THE

02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:38.983 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS SEEMS TO BE QUITE

02:32:36.981 --> 02:32:40.818 region:rollup2
ROBUST WELL HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:42.120 region:rollup2
THAT. AYE AYE I'LL TAKE THAT I I

02:32:40.818 --> 02:32:44.288 region:rollup2
THINK IN SOME RESPECTS THE

02:32:42.120 --> 02:32:45.823 region:rollup2
INSURANCE INDUSTRY LEARNED FROM

02:32:44.288 --> 02:32:48.526 region:rollup2
NORTHRIDGE A THEY WERE OVER

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:49.627 region:rollup2
EXPOSED AND PART OF THAT WAS

02:32:48.526 --> 02:32:52.230 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WERE MANDATE.

02:32:49.627 --> 02:32:54.832 region:rollup2
STATUTORY MANDATES THAT THEY

02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:56.501 region:rollup2
MUST OFFER EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE

02:32:54.832 --> 02:32:58.403 region:rollup2
SO THAT. PREVENTED THEM FROM

02:32:56.501 --> 02:32:59.103 region:rollup2
HAVING THE ABILITY TO REALLY

02:32:58.403 --> 02:33:00.605 region:rollup2
MANAGE THEIR RISK

02:32:59.103 --> 02:33:02.073 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT AS A RESULT YOU

02:33:00.605 --> 02:33:02.940 region:rollup2
DID WIND UP WITH OVER EXPOSURE.

02:33:02.073 --> 02:33:04.475 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:06.244 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO MANDATES.

02:33:04.475 --> 02:33:07.378 region:rollup2
I THINK IF YOU HAD MANDATE

02:33:06.244 --> 02:33:08.079 region:rollup2
SEATS YOU'D COULD SEE SOMETHING

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:10.248 region:rollup2
VERY.

02:33:08.079 --> 02:33:11.916 region:rollup2
MUCH LIKE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER

02:33:10.248 --> 02:33:13.317 region:rollup2
NORTHRIDGE INSURERS THERE'S I

02:33:11.916 --> 02:33:14.485 region:rollup2
THINK BECAUSE THE REASON THOSE

02:33:13.317 --> 02:33:16.187 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY RIGHT NOW IS

02:33:14.485 --> 02:33:17.388 region:rollup2
BECAUSE INSURANCE ARE ABLE TO

02:33:16.187 --> 02:33:19.157 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THEIR EXPOSURE THEY ARE

02:33:17.388 --> 02:33:21.492 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR RISK. AND

02:33:19.157 --> 02:33:22.093 region:rollup2
OTHER INSURERS WITH THAT CAN

02:33:21.492 --> 02:33:22.960 region:rollup2
WRITE IN THIS AREAS ARE COMING

02:33:22.093 --> 02:33:24.062 region:rollup2
IN.

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:25.830 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS YOU WANTED TO

02:33:24.062 --> 02:33:26.698 region:rollup2
GATHERS NUMBER THREE IMPORTANT

02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:28.599 region:rollup2
ELEMENT THAT'S REALLY DRIVING

02:33:26.698 --> 02:33:30.268 region:rollup2
THE. INTENSE COMPETITION

02:33:28.599 --> 02:33:32.036 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY FOR INSURANCE NOT

02:33:30.268 --> 02:33:33.504 region:rollup2
ONLY CALIFORNIA GLOBALLY AND

02:33:32.036 --> 02:33:34.672 region:rollup2
THAT'S A CAPITAL CAPACITY.

02:33:33.504 --> 02:33:36.340 region:rollup2
THERE'S DIMINISH NOT CAPITAL

02:33:34.672 --> 02:33:38.109 region:rollup2
GLOBAL CAPACITY AVAILABLE IN THE

02:33:36.340 --> 02:33:40.478 region:rollup2
WORLD THAT'S FUNNY NEEDS A PLACE

02:33:38.109 --> 02:33:41.813 region:rollup2
TO GO. AND IT'S IT FINDS ITS WAY

02:33:40.478 --> 02:33:42.880 region:rollup2
TO THE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE.

02:33:41.813 --> 02:33:44.148 region:rollup2
WHICH CREATES A COMMENCEMENT OF

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:46.117 region:rollup2
A COMPETITION.

02:33:44.148 --> 02:33:47.952 region:rollup2
FOR RETURN ON CAPITAL.

02:33:46.117 --> 02:33:49.053 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S RATE IT IT'S VERY

02:33:47.952 --> 02:33:50.655 region:rollup2
MUCH A CAPITAL DRIVEN.

02:33:49.053 --> 02:33:53.825 region:rollup2
.

02:33:50.655 --> 02:33:54.358 region:rollup2

ALRIGHT WELL THAT.

02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:03.868 region:rollup2

WONDERFUL WITNESSES BUT HERE'S

02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:06.264 region:rollup2
UP WHEN A SPARK. A LITTLE LAUGH.

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:08.199 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT ON.

02:35:06.264 --> 02:35:10.101 region:rollup2
IN THIS WAY. THAT.

02:35:08.199 --> 02:35:11.969 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT OUR FORCE

BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A SELF

02:35:20.912 --> 02:35:23.781 region:rollup2
INFLICTED WOUND THAT I SEE IN

OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:35:23.781 --> 02:35:25.983 region:rollup2
