00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:41.387
THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:43.422
TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT AS

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:44.523
WELL AS HEARING FROM THE VARIOUS

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.458
EVALUATIONS SO THAT HAVE BEEN

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:48.994
CONDUCTED -- KNOWLEDGE ABOUT

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:50.496
WHAT INFORMATION A WHAT

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:52.631
DOCUMENTS TO PROVIDE WHAT IS

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:55.100
NEEDED IS SOMETHING THAT IS HAS

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.902
BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE.

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.204
OKAY BECAUSE IT -- I'M HEARING

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.438
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.606
ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD BRING A

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.508
PASSPORT OR A SOCIAL SECURITY

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:04.643
CARD OR WHAT SUFFICES AND SO

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.378
WITH THE DMV MIGHT BE BETTER

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:07.546
ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ASK

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:11.450
MISS WEB TO ADDRESS THAT -- SHE

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.555
THIRD PANEL THANK YOU RIGHT.

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:18.157
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:19.858
CENTER NIELSEN.

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:22.595
AND READ OVER THE THE DOCUMENT

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:23.963
I'VE GOT HERE LATE AS WELL.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:24.496
BUT LET ME JUST ASK YOU A

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:27.233
GENERAL QUESTION [inaudible]

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:30.569
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE DMV

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.972
ARE NOT NEW.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:33.505
I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEM FOR

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.441
DECADES.

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:37.009
NOW WOULD IT BE YOUR OPINION

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.877
THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:39.645
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.779
DISCUSSED THERE WILL BE

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:43.015
PRESENTED HERE.

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:43.616
THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEAL

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:45.217
WITH.

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:47.319
OUR OUR THE ENDEMIC IN AND

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:49.388
INSTITUTIONALIZED.

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:51.390
WILL IT TAKE A LOT OF DOING.

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.092
THAT ON WIND THAT SORT OF

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.827
CORPORATE MENTALITY AND

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:56.695
STRUCTURE WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:58.197
THAT HAS BEEN SO PERVASIVE AND

00:14:58.264 --> 00:14:59.565
PERSISTENT.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.066
AND SO FRUSTRATING FOR THE

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:02.901
CITIZEN FOR SO LONG.

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.503
THERE IS CERTAINLY UNDERLYING

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.572
STRUCTURAL ISSUES AND IT

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.274
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.676
LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.945
EXPECTATIONS THEY HAVE FOR THE

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:15.547
DMV THAT CAN INCLUDE -- HOW THE

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:16.548
EXPECTS THE DMV TO PROVIDE

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:18.117
SERVICES WHAT GOALS AND KIND OF

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:19.518
PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT THEY

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.420
HAVE IN MIND? ONE OF THE THINGS

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:22.454
A LITTLE WITH THAT WE'LL GET TO

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:23.389
WHEN WE PRESENT ON YOUR THIRD

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:25.024
PANEL IS THAT WE DO THINK

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.558
SOMETHING TE LEGISLATURE WILL

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:27.960
WANT TO CONSIDER.

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:30.496
IS THE ISSUE OF ACTIVITIES THAT

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:32.298
HAVE SHORT TERM IMPACTS VERSUS

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.900
THOSE THAT HAVE LONG TERM

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:35.134
IMPACTS.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.368
IN BY THAT.

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.070
THE STATE IS SEEKING TO MEET

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:40.005
THIS OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.707
DEADLINE AND THEIR CERTAIN

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.442
ACTIONS THAT WILLREALLY HELP.

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:44.243
WILL REALLY HELP MEET THAT

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.045
DEADLINE. FOR SOME OF THE LONGER

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:48.747
TERM ACTIONS -- RATHER THAN KIND

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:49.982
OF APPROACHING IT SORT OF IN A

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:51.116
PIECEMEAL MANNER IT MAY MAKE

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:53.419
MORE SENSE TO HAVE THE ENVY AND

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.820
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS COME TOGETHER

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.355
AND REALLY THINK THROUGH.

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:57.523
KIND OF A LONG TERM KIND OF

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:59.658
STRATEGIC OR OPERATIONAL PLAN TO

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:04.530
REALLY LAY OUT WHAT THE STEPS

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:05.331
ARE. TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:07.466
SYSTEMIC CHANGES -- THE SYSTEMIC

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.335
ISSUES THAT ARE FACED SOME OF

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:10.703
THEM WE CAN POTENTIALLY BE VERY

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.771
EXPENSIVE SO FOR EXAMPLE I THINK

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:13.872
THAT THERE BEEN CONCERNS ABOUT

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:15.407
IT CAPABILITIES UNDERLYING ID

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:16.775
CAPABILITIES ETCETERA.

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.644
WE KNOW FROM OTHER BUDGET

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.979
DISCUSSIONS THAT IT -- PROJECTS

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:23.415
ARE FAIRLY EXPENSIVE BUT IT ALSO

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:24.650
REQUIRES DEPARTMENTAL RESOURCES

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:25.918
AND SO THAT SOMETHING OFF TO

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:27.619
KIND OF KEEP IN MIND AS THE

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:28.821
DEPARTMENT IS.

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:30.389
KIND OF THINKING THROUGH CHANGES

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.057
YOU HAVE KIND OF A LIMITED FOR

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:34.360
EXAMPLE EXECUTIVE STAFF OF THE

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:34.560
DMV.

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.161
AND SO THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:37.563
HOW MANY PROJECTS DO YOU WANT

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:38.831
MOVING AT THE SAME TIME CITY

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:40.265
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT THE

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:41.734
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.035
CONSIDER AS YOU MOVE FORWARD.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.537
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE BE VERY

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.206
DIRECTORY AT THIS TIME.

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:49.041
IN WHATEVER WE SUGGEST TO THIS

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:52.211
YEAR TO DMV TELLING THEM WHAT WE

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:53.779
EXPECT NOT TELLING.

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:54.980
HIM THAT HAVING THEM TELL US

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:57.883
WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO. TO GET

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.351
TO THE CORE.

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:00.986
PROBLEMS I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:05.958
GOING TO BE REQUIRED AS WELL AS

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:09.495
VERY -- IN DEPTH AND SUSTAINED

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:10.863
MONITORING.

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:12.231
OF THE AGENCY THANK YOU MADAM

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.232
CHAIR OF THINK IS UNTIL FOR THE

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:13.832
AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:14.500
THINK THAT ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:17.603
AS LEGISLATORS ARE INFORMED

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:18.203
ABOUT.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.071
WHAT'S FEASIBLE AND WHAT TO DO

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:20.272
WILL PULL THAT WE DO A BETTER

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.874
JOB AS LEGISLATORS TO REALLY

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.008
FIND THE MILLION TO STAND WHAT

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:25.043
IT TAKES TO GO TO TO CREATE

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.011
CULTURE SHIFT.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:27.713
AND TO AND TO FINANCE AND DESIGN

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.515
COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:31.917
CURRENT AND RELEVANT GOING FOR

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.285
IT WE WE HAVE HOMEWORK IN THE

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:37.089
MORNING TO DO OURSELVES.

WE ARE FACING SO MANY Q. CRISIS

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.306
BUT THIS IS PRIDE BUILT ON

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:56.608
CHRONIC ISSUES THAT CUMULATED

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:57.676
OVER TIME INCLUDING YOU KNOW AT

OVER THE LONG TERM -- VERY

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:19.465
SPANISH MARKS THAT -- WE THAT

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.233
SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATORS HAVE

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.568
EXPECTED THE DMV TO TRY TO HIT

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:23.902
OUR WEATHER WE MADE INVESTMENTS

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.537
AND HOW THEY TURNED OUT --

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.072
BECAUSE MAYBE IS NOW THREE OR

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:27.940
FIVE YEARS LATER AND PEOPLE

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:31.477
DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:33.145
THREE OR FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:34.379
SURE -- I THINK KIND OF HOW WE

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.482
ENVISION OUR FIRST ROLE ACTUALLY --

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:38.083
BE PRESENTED TO YOU LATER ON AS

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.585
PART OF TOWN FOR A WE THINK ARE

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:41.220
KIND OF FIRST ROLE IS THIS IS

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.154
THERE IS TRANSIT PRETTY

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.789
SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHOICES THAT

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:44.890
NEED TO BE MADE HERE.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.092
SO OUR ROLE AS WE SEE IT AS PART

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:48.760
OF YOUR THIRD PANEL IS TO

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.596
PROVIDE SOME THOUGHTS IN TERMS

00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:52.598
OF HOW TO THINK THROUGH. TO HOLD

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:54.633
THE LEGISLATURE THINK THROUGH AN

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.868
WAY THE KEY FACTOR.

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:56.368
I THINK IT WAS FUNNY I

00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:58.337
APPRECIATE THE OPTIONS AND SO

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:00.105
FORTH BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:01.373
YOUR HEALTH AND RATE RECOGNIZING

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.674
THEIR SOME LIMITATIONS TO HOW

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:04.977
MANY RESOURCES LA -- HAS IN

00:19:05.043 --> 00:19:06.578
TERMS OF HELPING MONITOR --

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.580
BEYOND JUST THE AGENCY ITSELF

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:12.084
REPORTING TO US.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.520
OUR THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MADE

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:16.088
THE POLICY THAT THE POLICIES

00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:16.655
THAT WE HAVE PASSED TODAY

00:19:16.722 --> 00:19:18.423
ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.492
SEVERAL YEARS LATER SIGNED AND

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:22.995
THAT THE SO IT'S GOING TO POLICY

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:23.896
OPTIONS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:24.696
FOLLOW THROUGH.

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:25.898
WELL ALSO IN LINE WITH THAT FOR

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:27.332
EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:28.600
WE HIGHLIGHT AS AN ISSUE FOR

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:29.434
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IS

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:30.536
THAT WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:32.638
CLEAR OUT COMING PERFORMANCE

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:33.071
GOALS.

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:34.640
ARE NEEDED IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:36.074
YOU AIMING FOR WHAT DO YOU WANT

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:37.576
TO ACCOMPLISH AND WE'RE NOT

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:38.043
REALLY SURE THAT THE

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.411
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:40.979
ACTUALLY CLEARLY LAYS OUT.

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.147
HIS SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.016
SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN CERTAINLY

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:45.417
WORK WITH STAFF AND MEMBERS TO

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.319
KIND OF DEFINE WHAT THOSE GOALS

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.287
ARE AND ONCE THOSE GOALS ARE

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.454
DEFINED.

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.455
THAT PROVIDES US WITH THE

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.124
BENCHMARKS OF FOR EXAMPLE IF

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.158
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:55.294
NECESSARY TO THEN ADVISE YOU ON

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.929
AND YOU KNOW DO THAT ANALYSIS ON

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.463
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S BEING

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.665
ACCOMPLISHED I MEAN THAT THAT'S

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:00.799
AN EXAMPLE.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.435
I THINK IN OTHER AREAS -- YOU

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:04.636
KNOW THINKING ABOUT WHAT LEVEL

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:05.771
OF OVERSIGHT.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:07.039
THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:08.640
AND SO FOR EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.542
CURRENTLY RECEIVES THESE ANNUAL

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:11.843
REPORTS ON WAIT TIMES.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.945
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:14.613
LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.515
BOTH KIND OF SHORT TERM AND LONG

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:18.383
TERM OPTIONS HE COULD INVOLVE

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.384
DIFFERENT REPORTING LANGUAGE

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:20.319
REGULAR REPORTING COMMITTEE

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.620
MONTHLY QUARTERLY THERE'S NO

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:23.088
KIND OF MAGICAL NUMBER.

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:24.523
BUT IT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.892
LAYING OUT WHAT ACTIVITIES OR

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:29.061
PROJECTS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:30.662
BEING IMPLEMENTED WHAT'S NEXT UP

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:33.165
IN THE QUEUE WHAT -- CHALLENGES

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.633
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THAT

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.603
REALLY HELPS US -- YOU KNOW KEEP

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:38.704
IT HELPS US INTO THE LEGISLATURE

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.405
KEEP UP TO DATE ON WHAT'S

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:41.139
OCCURRING AND WHETHER OR NOT

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:43.342
THERE'S ANYTHING THAT JUMPS OUT

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:43.842
AS BEING.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.310
A FLAT.

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:46.511
I THINK SEPARATELY FROM THAT AND

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.380
YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT --

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:49.915
THE LITTLE MEMBERS OF THE

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:50.849
LEGISLATURE INTERESTED IN A

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:51.850
VALUE AND HAVING US ABOUT A

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.452
PARTICULAR IDEAS AND THINGS LIKE

00:20:53.518 --> 00:21:00.325
THAT I MEAN THAT'S ALSO

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:00.926
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:03.028
ASSISTANCE WITH.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:03.962
THANK YOU -- WE'VE TALKED A LOT

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.630
ABOUT THE WAIT TIMES I HAVE ONE

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.498
GENERAL QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.033
ON TO THE SECOND.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:08.634
AND I'LL COME BACK YOU CENTER

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:08.867
STONE.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:09.534
CAN YOU GIVE US A GENERAL IDEA

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:10.769
OF WHAT STATES HAVE DONE A GOOD

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:12.537
JOB OF COMPLYING WITH THE REAL

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.306
ID.

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:14.906
KIND OF ROLL OUT AND PLANNING

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:16.141
TODAY.

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.242
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NOT

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:18.410
SPEND VERY MUCH TIME ON BUT I

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:19.745
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE SECRETARY

00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:21.246
OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.614
AGENCY AS PART OF THEIR DMB

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.049
REINVENTION TRACK TEAM ACTUALLY

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.050
SPENT TIME.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.852
REACHING OUT TO COUNTERPARTS IN

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:28.520
DOING THAT AND ALSO SO I THINK

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:29.755
THEY'LL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.123
SPEAK PERFECT ALL RIGHT TO THIS

00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:32.324
TOWN.

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:32.924
THAT WAS PART OF MY QUESTION

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:34.726
MADAM CHAIR BUT AS A LOOK

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:36.061
THROUGH THE REPORT.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:38.597
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH -- SINCE WE

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.632
STARTED THE PHYSICIANS AND

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:41.867
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE'VE.

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:43.669
INCREASED THE POSITION BY ALMOST

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:45.470
A THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED BY MY

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:48.540
CALCULATIONS -- I WANTED TO FIND

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:49.474
OUT IN OTHER STATES THAT THEY'VE

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:51.476
BEEN USING -- TECHNOLOGY TO TO

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:53.512
DECREASE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.580
NECESSARY FOR THE REAL ID BUT

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:57.816
THE REAL IDEAS REALLY -- STIFLED

00:21:57.883 --> 00:21:59.551
OTHER OPERATIONS WITH THE DMV

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:03.588
BECAUSE OF THE WORKLOAD SO --

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:04.356
AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THE

00:22:04.423 --> 00:22:04.990
GOVERNOR HAS A DIGITAL WHILE

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:06.892
PROGRAM THAT HE WANTS -- TO TO

00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:08.794
EMBRACE AND AND AND MOVE FORWARD.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.463
DOES THE LA -- DO ANY KIND OF

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.064
ANALYSIS.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.466
TO SEE IF THERE IS TECHNOLOGICAL

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:16.268
MEANS THAT WE CAN USE THAT CAN

00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:17.903
IT WILL ALWAYS SEEM TO THROW

00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:19.504
MONEY IN POSITIONS AT A PROBLEM.

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:20.539
BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE THE

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:22.040
MANPOWER IT'S NECESSARY IT'S THE

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:23.775
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS REALLY GOING

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:25.944
TO STREAMLINED SERVICE AT THE

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:26.144
DMV.

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:29.648
SO HAVE YOU EVALUATED THE THE

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:32.984
NEEDS OF THE DMV TECHNOLOGICALLY

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:35.087
TO MAKE THEM ON MORE EFFICIENT.

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:37.589
MAKE THEM RUN FASTER AND LESS

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.658
EXPENSIVE.

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:40.726
WE HAVE THERE'S AND THERE'S A

00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:42.494
WIDE RANGE OF KIND OF

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:43.395
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS ARE

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:45.330
OPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:46.832
IN THESE -- BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:48.100
ARE BEING DISCUSSED TO AS PART

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:49.634
OF THE VALUATIONS I THINK THE

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.570
INTERESTING THING IS THAT YOU'LL

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:52.637
HAVE KIND OF CONSULTING

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:54.806
COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY DIVING

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:55.941
IN FOR IN DEPTH TO DO THIS AND

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.042
THIS IS LAST MINUTE -- I THINK

00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:58.744
FROM OUR VIEWPOINT WE HAVE

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.412
ASSESSED TECHNOLOGY TO THE

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:01.613
EXTENT THAT THEY WERE PART OF A

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.882
BUDGET PROPOSAL SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:05.550
WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR

00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:06.952
VEHICLES FIRST.

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:07.886
WITH CONSIDERING THE SELF

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:09.554
SERVICE TERMINALS WE DID

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.957
EVALUATE THAT PROPOSAL AND AND

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:12.891
KIND OF OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS ON

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:13.759
THAT.

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:17.629
THERE ARE A WIDE RANGE OF THAT --

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:18.697
IDEAS BEING.

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:19.631
OFFERED NOW I THINK THAT'S

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:20.632
SOMETHING THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:21.166
DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS A

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.033
REINVENTION TRACK TEAM ARE

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.101
CONSIDERING YOU'VE GOT

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:24.569
CONSULTANTS ETCETERA.

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:25.203
AND SO I THINK PART OF THOSE

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.139
EVALUATION WILL REALLY HELP

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:28.673
INFORM THIS DISCUSSION AND KIND

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.508
OF DETERMINE WHERE THE

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:31.209
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO FOCUS ITS

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:32.077
ATTENTION.

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.812
AND I WOULD I WOULD ALSO KIND OF

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:35.680
KICK IT BACK TO THIS LARGER

00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:37.649
ISSUE OF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:38.750

HAVE TO GO IN AND WITH

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.074
EFFICIENCY AND AND REDUCE COSTS

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:04.242
WHEREVER POSSIBLE BY UTILIZING

00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:05.443
TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE THOSE

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.145
GOALS SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:21.927
NINE BANKRUPTCY SO -- WE WE PUT

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:23.328
IN A LOT OF REFORM SOMEONE OF

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:24.963
THOSE REFORMS WAS PROVIDING AN

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.498
ANNUAL BUSINESS STAY FOR

YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO.

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.141
HOW WE MEASURE IT?

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:38.610
AND HOW WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:41.246
DOING IN THE NEXT YEAR AND AND

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:42.647
THEN HOW DID WE MEET THE PRIOR

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:43.915
YOUR SCHOOLS IMAGES JUST A IT'S

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:45.083
A NICE.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.085
ROAD MAP FOR ANY SUPERVISOR

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:49.087
LEGISLATOR TO PICK UP.

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:50.555
AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS BEING

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:52.390
APPEAR I HAVEN'T SEEN A BUSINESS

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:55.794
PLAN I BASS FORM BUT I CAN I GET.

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:57.996
CUTE SMILES BUT WITH THE DMV OF

00:24:58.063 --> 00:24:59.631
HAD A BUSINESS PLAN IS SAID WE

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:00.699
ANTICIPATE.

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:02.234
THE S. THIS AMOUNT OF INCREASE

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.169
IN VOLUME.

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:05.804
THEREFORE WE NEED THIS AMOUNT OF

00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:07.873
NEW EMPLOYEES WE NEED TO TRAIN

00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:09.608
AND BY THIS AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:10.809
AND AND WE NEED TO INTEGRATE

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.344
THAT WITH THE STATE'S BUDGET THE

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.246
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AND

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:16.214
AND AND DO WE HAVE THAT. FOR

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:20.218
DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE.

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:21.620
I FIFTY EIGHT I THINK

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:23.288
DEPARTMENTS REACTS DIFFERENTLY

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.789
DEPENDING ON WHAT INITIATIVES

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:25.724
ARE COMING THEIR WAY WE'VE

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.592
CERTAINLY AS PART OF THE BUDGET

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.060
PROCESS BEEN PRESENTED WITH

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:32.097
DIFFERING LEVELS OF INFORMATION --

00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:34.432
RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO THE DMB

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:36.835
I THINK THAT -- WHEN YOUR SECOND

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:39.504
PANEL PRESENTS ONE OF THE THINGS

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:41.306
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.674
AUDIT IDENTIFIED WAS THAT THERE

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:43.808
WERE SOME CHALLENGES IN

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.176
PREPARING FOR REAL ID

00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:46.578
IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT'S

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.046
SOMETHING THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT?

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:49.781
IT SO --MOVING FORWARD AS

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.516
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:54.152
PROCEED NEXT WITH THE MV WHAT

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:56.054
LEVEL OF RESOURCES TO PROVIDE

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:56.821
WHAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT TO

INCLUDE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:00.825
ARE IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND --

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:01.826
VERY SIMILARLY AND ADDRESSING

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.395
SENATOR CAN'T QUESTION WE'RE

00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:04.596
TALKING ABOUT KIND OF CLEAR

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:05.597
OUTCOME OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:06.965
THAT'S ONE OF THE THAT'S ONE OF

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:08.466
THE REASONS THAT WE MENTIONED

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:09.467
THAT AS BEING POTENTIALLY

00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:10.035
IMPORTANT.

00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:11.770
THINKING ABOUT APPROPRIATE

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:16.441
REPORTING EXCITER A SO.

00:26:16.508 --> 00:26:17.075
IF I WERE TO ASK THE DMV I I'D

00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:17.676
LIKE TO KNOW YOUR METRICS FOR

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:18.710
THE LAST TEN YEARS HOW MANY CARS

00:26:18.777 --> 00:26:20.312
DID YOU REGISTER EVERY YEAR.

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:22.447
HOW MANY NEW CARS HOW MANY USED

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:23.148
CARS?

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:26.084
IS THAT ALL THAT DATA AVAILABLE

00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:26.685
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF TRENDS WE

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:27.652
HAVE.

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:29.621
DMV DOES COLLECT DATA AND IT AND

00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:31.456
THEY HAVE PROVIDED DATA --

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:32.557
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AS

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:34.125
WELL AS REPORTS THAT ARE

00:26:34.192 --> 00:26:35.193
REQUESTED THEM FROM SO FOR

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.361
EXAMPLE I REFERENCED IN THE

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:38.964
PRESENTS REPORTS ON MONTHLY WAIT

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.900
TIMES -- SOMETIMES THE DATA

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.501
THAT'S COLLECTED BY THE

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:45.337
DEPARTMENT IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:26:45.403 --> 00:26:48.273
THE SAME AS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.341
OR POLICY MAKING STAFF ARE

00:26:49.407 --> 00:26:50.642
INTERESTED IN.

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.978
AND SO PART OF THESE DISCUSSIONS

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:54.045
IS REALLY KIND OF RE.

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:57.415
ALIGNING THE TO SO TO THE EXTENT

00:26:57.482 --> 00:26:58.717
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY

00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:00.986
SPECIFIES THEIR EXPECTATIONS

00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:02.554
THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT THEN

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.255
TO THINK AHEAD AND BEGIN

00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:05.757

QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THIRTY STONE

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:52.530
FAQ -- MADAM CHAIR I I KIND OF

THE ISSUES -- I FIND IT.

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:05.810
RATHER ALARMING WHEN YOU MENTION

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:07.144
THAT ONE THIRD OF THE SLOTS --

00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:10.481
WERE WERE OPE WHEN CUSTOMERS

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:11.849
WERE COMING AND YOU KNOW

00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:14.351
SOMETIMES I THINK -- HAS AS

00:39:14.418 --> 00:39:15.653
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES SOMETIMES

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.055
WE FORGET WHO ARE BOSSES ARE --

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:20.057
ELECTED OFFICIALS CONSTANTLY

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:21.158
REMINDED WHO ARE BOSSES ARE NOT

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:23.394
THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:25.763
WE SERVE.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.666
AND SO -- WHAT OF WHAT WILL

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.000
THOSE PEOPLE DOING A ONE THIRD

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:33.504
OF THE SLOT SIR ARE DOWN I MEAN-IT WE?

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:34.905
WE'VE ADDED -- BUDGET REQUESTS.

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:36.640
TO ADD UPWARDS OF A THOUSAND

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:39.443
PEOPLE INTO -- VARIOUS DMV

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.712
OFFICES AND WHAT IS PEOPLE DOING.

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.447
SO FROM THE OFFICE AS WE VISITED

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.181
WE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:45.750
SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.752
THAT ONE THIRD 30% OF WINDOW

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:50.488
CLOSURES -- ONE OF THEM WAS DUTY

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.323
BREAKS AND LUNCH PERIOD SO WHEN

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:54.458
A PERSON GOES ON BREAK OR GOES

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:55.392
ON LUNCH THERE ISN'T ANOTHER

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:56.327
PERSON.

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:57.828
OF FOR THE ONES THAT WE VISITED

00:39:57.895 --> 00:39:59.597
TO FILL THAT WINDOW AND CONTINUE

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:00.731
HELPING CUSTOMERS.

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:03.801
ANOTHER REASON IS FOLKS --

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:05.536
CALLING IN SICK OR ABSENT FROM

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:07.171
THE OFFICE THAT DAY -- AND THEN

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.106
THE THIRD REASON WOULD BE THAT

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:09.707
NOT.

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:11.308
EVERY POSITION IN THAT FIELD

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:13.844
OFFICE HAS BEEN TRAINED TO WORK

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:15.946
THAT WINDOW TO HELP DRIVERS

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:17.481
LICENSE OR REGISTRATION.

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:19.049
BUT YOU MENTIONED TRAINING --

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.551

LICENSE OR REGISTRATION.

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:28.659
I FIND THAT.

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:29.627
PASTORS ARE WITH THEIR DMV

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:30.294
EMPLOYEES AS ONE OF THE PRIMARY

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.128
FUNCTIONS OF EMPLOYEES AT THE

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:33.731
DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES HOW

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:35.933
CAN WE HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.734
THAT.

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.569
WE PUT PEOPLE AT A WINDOW IN

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:39.136
THAT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:40.371
PROCESS THESE.

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:45.943
BASIC -- SERVICES -- SAYS YOUR

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.711
QUESTION HOW I'M SORRY WHAT WAS

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:51.515
YOUR QUESTION.

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.050
I GATHER THIS IS AUDITS AND IF.

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:55.085
THEY CAN ANSWER.

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.320
IN HALF AND THEN THE THE MAYBE

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:56.921

HAD LIKE FIFTEEN YEARS TO

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:04.762
PREPARE FOR IT.

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:06.063
WHAT SOUNDS LIKE IN THAT FIFTEEN

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.331
YEAR PERIOD WE DIDN'T DO A WHOLE

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:08.866
LOT TO PREPARE FOR IT SOUNDS

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.034
LIKE WE GOT?

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.469
HIT WITH THE STORM OF REQUESTS

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:14.405
AND NOT EVEN UNDER.

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:16.507
STANDING THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE

REAL ID IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:36.393
RETURN TO THE DMV BECAUSE OF OUR

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:41.699
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.801

WE'VE SPENT BILLIONS IN.

00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:00.544

HE MENTIONED THAT.

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.154
THEY DID NOT FOLLOW QUOTE

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.489
INDUSTRY STANDARDS.

00:43:12.556 --> 00:43:15.426
AND DOES A EMBARKED ON NEW I. T.

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:15.726
[inaudible]

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.027
THEN.

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:18.696
WHAT DID THEY DO WHAT WAS THEIR

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:20.197
GUIDES?

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.665
IN LIEU OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:23.434
DID THEY JUST INVENT THEIR OWN

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.102
OR DID THEY JUST NOT.

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:29.373
EMPLOYEE STANDARDS.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.507
SO DO WE HAVE A SYSTEM

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:32.409
DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE WHICH

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:34.178
WOULD BUT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED AS

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.846
THEIR STANDARD.

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.881
FOR IT PROJECTS AND THE DESIGN

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:39.550
OF THAT PROCESS DOES FOLLOW

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.418
INDUSTRY STANDARDS HOWEVER WITH

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:43.487
THE REAL ID PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:45.489
HAD A SHORTENED TIME FRAMES.

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:48.225
THEY HAD -- TO FIVE PASSED

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:52.529
CERTAIN PARTS OF THAT PLAN OF

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:52.963
THAT CYCLE.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.298
SO AS I MENTIONED SOME OF THE

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:55.632
TESTING OF THE SYSTEM --

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:58.669
RESOLVING DEFECTS OF THE SYSTEM

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:01.105
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THEY CUT

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:02.439
OUT OF THEIR CYCLE.

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.575
THE DAY NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED

00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:06.410
THIS EVENTUALITY THOUGH AND

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:07.778
BUILT IN SOME PROCEDURES TO

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:10.481
ACCOMMODATE IT. TO RESPOND MORE

00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:11.782
QUICKLY WHEN THEY SAW THAT

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.717
THINGS WERE NOT GOING.

00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:14.518
ACCORDING [inaudible]

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:17.755
TO EDGELL -- ISN'T THAT A NORMAL

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:18.889
WAY OF BUSINESS.

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:21.458
MANAGES IT'S TIME LINES AND AND

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:24.495
BENCHMARKS.

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.630
YES I WOULD AGREE AND AS WE SAY

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:29.333
IN OUR REPORT BECAUSE THE REAL

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.635
I. T. I. T. PROJECT WAS NOT MADE

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:33.937
A PRIORITY UNTIL.

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:34.505
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY HAD A

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:35.906
LIMITED TIME FRAME AND NOT --

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:37.474
THESE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.776
THEY MADE IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:41.478
JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN ROLL OUT

00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:43.847

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:46.550
THAT A PRIORITY SO.

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.318
THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT AND I

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:50.854

00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:53.190
THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT.

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:55.459
THE CRY OF AGENCIES WHEN THEY

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.594
HAVE TROUBLES.

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:59.430
BACK LOG SERVICE.

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:01.498
ALL KINDS THEY COME TO THE

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:02.633
LEGISLATURE AND SAY WE NEED MORE

00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:05.102

AND HOW IT WILL MAKE A

00:45:16.313 --> 00:45:17.114
DIFFERENCE.

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:19.483

A VISION CERTIFICATION FROM

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:34.625
IS THERE A GOLD STANDARD OUT

00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:35.726

A GOLD STANDARD OF OF A STATE

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:40.564
THAT WE CAN ASPIRE TO MATCH OR

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:40.764
BEAT.

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.533
WE DID NOT -- PERFORM THAT

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:43.400
ANALYSIS.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.635
PERHAPS THE DMV HAS THAT

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.203
INFORMATION AND COULD ANSWER

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.771
THAT QUESTION ON THE REAL ID

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.573
ISSUE SPECIFICALLY ALL FIFTY

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.609
STATES HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:55.913
SO -- AGAIN AS OUR STATE OUT

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.648

00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:59.183
EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:00.551
FOR THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION I

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:03.353

THIS I THINK IT'S JUST AN

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:17.568
OBSERVATION MAYBE IN WRONG.

00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:18.302
A THERE SEEMS TO BE PARTICULAR

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:19.002
FOCUS AND CERTAINLY VERY

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:20.504
IMPORTANT THE CUSTOMER

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:21.705
EXPERIENCE AT THAT ARE FACE TO

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:24.007
FACE INTERACTION AND I KNOW YOU

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:26.109
DID LOOK A LITTLE BIT ONLINE BUT

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:27.678
I GUESS IN TERMS OF AND AND YOU

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:28.779
MADE MENTION JUST MADE MENTION

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:30.414
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.583
HANDLE THINGS OUTSIDE THE OFFICE

00:47:32.649 --> 00:47:35.152
BUT THIS IS THERE ARE GONNA BE

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:36.753
MORE APPROACH OF LOOKING AT MY

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.722
SAY THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IT'S

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:40.290
ACTUALLY NOT JUST.

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:43.093
INTERFACING WITH AN OFFICE OR

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.628
EVEN A KIOSK BUT JUST OVERALL

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:46.496
BECAUSE OF THE DISEASE MENTIONED

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:47.898
WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING.

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:49.433
TO DECREASE IN FACT THAT'S KIND

00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:50.634
OF THE EXPECTATION NOW RIGHT AND

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.036
EVEN A KIOSK SEEMS A LITTLE OLD

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:55.472
FASHIONED BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE.

00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:55.939
IN MOST OF THE SITE.

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:56.573
WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING A BILL

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.375
LATER ON TODAY ABOUT PEOPLE

00:47:58.442 --> 00:47:59.876
GETTING FOOD DELIVERED USING TO

00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:02.946
CAO FRESH BENEFITS AND WHAT KIND

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:03.547
OF GUIDELINES YOU HAVE THAT IN

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:04.481
OTHER WORDS.

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:06.149
WE ORDERED THINGS -- AND WE

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.951
HAVEN'T DELIVER TO OUR DOOR.

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:09.119
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE NEW

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:10.921
EXPECTATION IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:12.623
EVERYTHING WITH YOUR COMPUTER OR

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.491
YOUR I. PHONE AND THEN WHATEVER

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:16.493
YOU NEED GETS MAILED TO YOU.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.394
IT'S A LOCATION THAT YOU

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:19.229
DESIGNATE I REALIZE WE DO HAVE

00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:20.631
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ADDRESSES

00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:22.766
AND FIGURE THAT OUT BUT I I

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.201
THINK IN TERMS OF TRYING TO LOOK

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:26.803
MORE BROADLY -- BUT WE LOOKING

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.305
AT THAT KIND OF DEVICE THAT THE

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:29.740
TOTAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE FROM

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.541
THE TIME THEY NEED TO ENCOUNTER

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:32.609
DMV TO AND HOPEFULLY THEY NEVER

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:33.877
EXCEED EVER NEED TO TOUCH IN

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.412
OFFICE IS THAT SOMETHING THE

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:38.382
THAT WAS LOOKED AT BY -- THIS

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:38.615
AUDIT.

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:39.750
I THINK THAT BEYOND THE FIELD

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.752
OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:42.719
MAYBE SOMETHING THE STRIKE TEAM

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.721
OR DMV COULD SPEAK TOWARDS -- I

00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:46.456
WILL SAY THAT THE ONE OF THE

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:47.658
REASONS WHY WE FOCUSED OUR

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:51.662
EFFORTS ON THE FIELD OFFICE WAS.

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:52.296
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT TO

00:48:52.362 --> 00:48:53.797
GET A REAL ID YOU HAVE TO GO TO

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:55.399
A FIELD OFFICE YOU CAN'T DO

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:56.700
THROUGH ANOTHER SERVICE CHANNEL

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.468
BUT THE LAST TIME FOCUSED ON

00:48:58.535 --> 00:49:00.237
REAL IDEA AND SO THAT WAS. ONE

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.638
OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF US

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:03.707
FOCUSING ON FIELD OFFICES AND

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:04.741
THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:06.276
IS IN TERMS OF I. T. RECOGNIZING

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:08.045
WE HAVE A LEGACY SYSTEM I

00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:09.479
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE TO STILL

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:10.580
USING KOBOL.

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:11.648
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY

00:49:11.715 --> 00:49:15.719
PEOPLE EVEN RECOGNIZE WAT KOBOL

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:19.089
IS ANYMORE -- THE OF WE ALSO

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:20.424
RECOGNIZE ALSO TAKES TIME TO

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.625
DEVELOP IT SYSTEMS ARE WE

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:23.994
LOOKING AT I'D SAY IT'S SOME OFF

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:26.096
THE SHELF TYPE OF APPROACHES AS

00:49:26.163 --> 00:49:27.731
WELL BECAUSE WE MAY NOT HAVE

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:28.799
TIME GIVE THE DEADLINES OF THE

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:31.101
REAL ID TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:31.968
BRAND NEW.

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:35.539
COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:37.574
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE INVESTED SOME

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:38.775
BEFORE I'M NOT SURE OF WHERE WE

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:40.544
ARE N THAT TIME LINE TO BE SURE

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:41.978
IT'S ACTUALLY UP AND RUNNING

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:42.713
FAST ENOUGH.

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.381
WE CAN BE UP AND RUNNING BY THE

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:45.782
DEADLINE THAT'S TOO LATE IT HAS

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:47.184
TO BE UP AND RUNNING RIGHT NOW.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.853
SO WHERE ARE WE WITH THE I. T. --

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.089
INFRASTRUCTURE WE OOKING AT IF

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:53.957
WE'RE NOT THERE READY WHAT ARE

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:54.524
WE LOOKING AT OFF THE SHELF

00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:55.859
SOLUTIONS.

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:58.662
I WOULD JUST -- I WOULD DEFER TO

00:49:58.729 --> 00:50:00.530
DMB FOR THAT ANSWER OF HELL DAVE

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:02.065
PLAN TO TRANSITION FROM THOSE

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.667
LEGACY LANGUAGES.

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.168
HOWEVER WE DID HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:09.673
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.442
FACING THEIR I. T. OPERATION

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:14.478
THEIR I. T. PORTFOLIO AND THEIR

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:15.512
I. T. WARN YOU ASK YOU THAT FROM

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:16.580
OUT ITS PERSPECTIVE -- IS THE I.

00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:18.782
T. SYSTEM RIGHT NOW SUFFICIENT

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.585
TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM -- AS WE

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:22.652
POINT OUT OUR AUDIT THEY HAVE A

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:23.954
DMV HAS EXPERIENCED.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.692
MULTIPLE OUTAGES INCIDENTS AND

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.661
THAT SOUNDS LIKE NO.

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:33.497
THEY HAVE A HIGH A HIGH RISK IT

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:35.632
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALL I CAN

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.601
TELL OKAY.

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:38.435
IF YOU COULD CLARIFY FOR ME

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:39.369
BECAUSE I I'M HERE IN A NUMBER

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:40.270
OF MY COLLEAGUES I THINK ASKING

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:41.338
YOU QUESTIONS REALLY KIND OF

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:42.839
BEYOND THE SCOPE OF AN AUDIT

00:50:42.906 --> 00:50:44.441
THAT IN AN AUDIT YOU DON'T DO

00:50:44.508 --> 00:50:47.577
THESE KINDS OF COMPARISONS TO

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.880
OTHER STATES IT'S IT'S NOT.

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:51.214
THAT'S NOT WHAT AN ODDITY ITSELF

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:53.383
FROM AN AUDIT AND EVALUATION

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:56.586
PERSPECTIVE -- WHAT COMES NEXT

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:59.022
YOU'VE DONE THE AUDIT -- IS

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:01.892
THERE ANY EXPECTATION -- THAT

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:06.596
THE AGENCY OR THE DEPARTMENT --

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:08.298

TICKING OFF THEY'VE HANDLED THIS

00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:13.270
RECOMMENDATION.

00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:15.172
IT'S IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD FROM

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:17.541
WHICH I COME WHEN WE GOT TO GET

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:19.242

SAY THESE COURSE CORRECTIONS

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:26.917
WERE MADE IS THAT THE NATURE OF

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:27.451
AS A STE.

00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:29.286

PEOPLE AS MY UNDERSTANDING --

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.570
THEY ALSO CREATED A OFFICE OF

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.605

MENTION IN MY PREPARED REMARKS

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:25.534
BUT PART OF THE EARLY ON EFFORT

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:26.635
THAT I UNDERTOOK THE TEAM

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:34.743

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.779

FOLIO REVIEW IT REVIEW -- AS A

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:40.749
RESULT OF THAT.

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:41.884
WE LEARNED -- AS IT'S BEEN WELL

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.652
DOCUMENTED AND STATED THAT THE

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.521
I. T. STRUCTURE AT THE DMV IS

01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:46.989
FRAGILE -- THE D. M. V. EIGHT

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:48.624
WHICH IS THE DATABASE NOT ONLY

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:50.426
COLD BALL BUT ASSEMBLY -- WHICH

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:53.128
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED IS

01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:55.498
USE THE LANGUAGE SO.

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:58.667
WE HAVE HAVE -- WITH THE

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.035
DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA TECH

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:01.470
TOP THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:02.972
TECHNOLOGY AND THE DMV OF

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:05.608
UNDERTAKEN SOME -- WE SUGGESTED

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.476
THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN SOME

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:12.047
ACTIVITIES -- THAT WILL AND

01:09:12.114 --> 01:09:13.616
SECURE AND STABILIZE THE MIDDLE

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.518
TIER OF THE STACK IF YOU WILL

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.052
THAT AREA THAT HAS IBM

01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:21.190
PROPRIETARY FUNCTIONS AND SOME

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:23.025
OF THE PROPRIETARY LANGUAGES

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:24.693
THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT OVER THE

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:24.927
YEARS.

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.929
SO THOSE THOSE ARE F. PEAS ARE

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.098
OFF OF THOSE ARE OUT ON THE

01:09:29.164 --> 01:09:30.933
STREET NOW AND WILL BE IN THE

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.602
NEXT COUPLE WEEKS -- SO WE CAN

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.938
STABILIZE THE STACK AND SO WE

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.873
CAN INDEED ADD ON OTHER

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.442
TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FEZ IN A

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:43.312
SUCCESSFUL MANNER -- THAT WILL

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.548
NOT. TO USE A COMMON TERM BREAK

01:09:45.614 --> 01:09:48.484
THE BACK OF THE I. T. SYSTEMS A

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.685
DMV I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:53.088
THE QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR --

01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:55.090

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:57.393
YOU -- MADAM SECRETARY LET ME

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:01.463
LET ME BEAGAIN BY ASKING --

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.166
KIND OF AN OVER ARCHING QUESTION --

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:06.368
WE HEARD THAT THE CHARGE OF THE

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.504
STRIKE TEAM BY THE GOVERNOR WAS

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:10.873
TO QUOTE. TO TO QUOTE YOU

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.441

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:13.576
AND MY QUESTION IS FROM YOUR

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:15.277
PERSPECTIVE WHAT ROLE DO YOU

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:17.780
PERCEIVE THE LEGISLATURE AS

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:20.516
PLAIN AS YOU.

WORK TO REINVENT THE DMB AND I

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:24.286
ASKED THAT QUESTION FROM THIS

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.654
PERSPECTIVE.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:28.691
WHEN THE DEPARTMENT IS IN CRISIS?

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:32.561
PARTICULARLY A DEPARTMENT.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.597
THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL.

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:37.466
IT'S PIVOTAL. TO THE EXPERIENCE

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:40.736
OF EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. TO

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:42.738
THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT.

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:45.608
I DON'T BELIEVE IT BEHOOVES US.

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:46.709
TO HAVE EITHER IN AN

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:49.345
ANTAGONISTIC OR NON INCLUSIVE

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.614
RELATIONSHIP.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.749
WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE.

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:55.551
YOU'VE HEARD QUESTIONS AND

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.620

TO US IN RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.623
THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE IN A

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.091
POSITION OF ESTABLISHING

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:05.194
EXPECTATIONS A FRAMEWORK.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.595
YOU'VE HEARD MY COLLEAGUE TALK

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:07.429
ABOUT.

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:09.031
DEPARTMENTS COME IN ASKING FOR

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.266
MONEY BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:14.403
OF ACCOUNTABILITY WE HAVE A

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.338
OVERSIGHT ROLE TO PLAY AS

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:18.040
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.342
AND SO IF YOU ARE UNDERTAKING A

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.478
JOB AS SIGNIFICANT AND BIG AS

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:25.180
REINVENTING A STATE DEPARTMENT.

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.515
WHAT ROLE IS THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:28.550
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE SUPPOSED

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.785
TO PLAN THAT?

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.754
A VERY AIM CENTRAL AND IMPORTANT

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.322
ONE AS YOU SAID MADAM CHAIR

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.323
EARLIER AND WE'VE HEARD

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.525
INDIVIDUALLY FROM MANY MEMBERS

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:37.126
BOTH FROM THE SENATE AND THE

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:38.527
ASSEMBLY.

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:40.429
THIS IS EITHER THE NUMBER ONE OR

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:42.297
THE NUMBER TO CONSTITUENTS ISSUE

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.565
THAT YOU ARE FACED WITH.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:44.967
THAT MEANS IT'S A POLITICAL

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:47.770
IMPERATIVE AND FOR FOR US IT IS

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.238
A CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPERATIVE

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:51.240
AND AS YOU SO WELL SAID NOW I'M

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:54.843
CHAIR -- THE DMV IS S. SERVICES

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:55.944
EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:58.414
CALIFORNIA -- I APPRECIATE VERY

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.215
MUCH YOUR COMMENT THAT -- IT

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.518
SHOULD NOT BE A A

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.853
CONFRONTATIONAL RELATIONSHIP IT

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.523
SHOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP.

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:10.359
AND THE THE LEGISLATURE I'VE I'M

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.960
OF COURSE SECRETARY GOV OPS AND

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.395
I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DMV

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:14.630
UNTIL THIS.

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.532
RECENTLY SO I WASN'T INVOLVED IN

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:18.067
ALL THE ACTIVITY LAST SUMMER AND

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:19.468
FALL.

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.704
BUT YOU PARTNER AND WITH THE DMV

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.605
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL IN

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:26.241
PROVIDING RESOURCES AND MUCH

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:28.010
NEEDED RESOURCES AT THE TIME AND

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.412
I SEE GOING FORWARD THAT WE HAVE

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:32.081
AN OBLIGATION THE STATE EVERY

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.515
EVERY AGENCY EVERY DEPARTMENT IN

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:34.783
THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:35.984
REPORT.

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:36.985
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND WHAT

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:37.786
THEY ARE DOING WITH THE

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.655
IMPORTANT APPROPRIATIONS THAT

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:43.525
YOU HAVE GIVEN US INTERESTED IN

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:45.094
US?

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.095
SO -- THE THE THIS IS AN

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.062
UNPRECEDENTED TIME FOR CASH FOR

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.664
DMV IT REALLY REALLY IS THE

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.532
NUMBERS ARE HORRIFIC TO THINK

01:12:50.599 --> 01:12:54.169
THAT WE HAVE TO TRANSACT.

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.138
TWICE AS MANY TRANSACTIONS AS

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.640
THEY CURRENTLY ARE DOING IN

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.509
ORDER TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE A

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:03.312
REAL ID WHO NEED NEEDS ONE BE

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:06.215
FOUR OR NEED ONE BEFORE OCTOBER

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.883
ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY I MEAN I I

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.118
MENTIONED THAT WE'RE DOING THIS

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:11.386
POP BUT DMV WITH HEALTH NET AND

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:13.021
AS A PILOT.

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.857
AND THAT YES INDEED DOES FOCUS

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:16.391
ON BUSINESS TRAVELERS BUT OUR

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:17.493
COMMERCE IN THE STATE OF

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.027
CALIFORNIA IS VITALLY IMPORTANT

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.629
AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT MUST

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:22.231
TRAVEL TO CONTINUE THE COMMERCE

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.632
OF OF CALIFORNIA.

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.734
THEY MUST HAVE A REAL IDE.

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.369
UNLESS THEY ARE WILLING TO USE

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:29.271
AND HAVE A PASSPORT BUT

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:30.973
CERTAINLY NOT EVERYONE DOES.

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.642
THOSE ARE SCARY NUMBERS TO ME

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:34.543
FRANKLY.

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:35.844
AND AND WEHAVE.

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.946
TO BETWEEN NOW AND THEN IT WE

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.314
HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:44.553
POSSIBLY CAN. TO ON TO INCREASE

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.456
THE SUCCESSFUL ASH ONCE OF A

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:49.491
REAL ID AND THAT IS AS I'VE

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:50.993
OUTLINED THAT'S GETTING PEOPLE

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.261
OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICES THAT

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:53.695
DON'T NEED TO BE THERE.

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.131
THAT CAN TRANSACT ELSEWHERE

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:57.833
ONLINE.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.469
AT A KIOSK WE HAVE TO EVENTUALLY

01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:02.471
AFTER THE CRISIS PASSES AND AYE

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:04.139
CONSIDERATE THAT.

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.141
WE DO HAVE TO REINVENT THE DMB

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.276
WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:08.844
PROCESS IS AS WE ARE DOING WITH

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.746
OUR PILOT WITH MACKENZIE THAT IS

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:13.715
LOOKING AT HOW THE PROCESSES --

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.450
FUNCTION HOW THE DMV FIELD

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:17.920
OFFICE FUNCTIONS AND REMOVING

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.721
THOSE NON ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OR

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.390
PROCESSES FRANKLY SOME OF THAT

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:23.559
FLOW HAS BEEN THE SAME WAY SINCE

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.661
PROBABLY WELL BEFORE YOU MANY OF

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:28.230
YOU WERE BORN -- WE HAVE TO

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.399
BRING IT INTO THE FUTURE.

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:32.100
AND AS I SAID WE HAVE SIX MONTHS --

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:34.503
JULY IS WHEN I'M SUPPOSED TO RUN

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.573
SORT OF HAND OFF TO THE NEXT

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:38.106
FOLKS.

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:40.742
OR THE DMV AND HOPEFULLY MANY OF

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.377
OUR IDEAS ARE SHORT TERM AND

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.079
MANY OF THEM ARE LONG TERM AND

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.480
ALL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:47.983
THE POINT OF MY QUESTION IS

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:50.252
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THESE

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:53.589
NUMBERS AND THE EXPECTED

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.190
WORKLOAD ARE UNPRECEDENTED.

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:56.291
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT OUR

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:57.492
STRATEGY IN TERMS OF THE

01:14:57.559 --> 01:14:59.261
PARTNERSHIP LOOK DIFFERENT TO

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:00.762
THE STATUS QUO IS SIMPLY NOT

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:03.065
ENOUGH. TO SIMPLY COME TO US

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:03.699
AROUND AN EXPECTATION FOR

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:06.568
PROCREATION IS ON THE BACK IN

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:08.270
AND OFTEN TOO LATE.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.238
AND SO THE POINT OF MY QUESTION

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:11.139
IS BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.741
THE PROBLEM I WOULD HOPE THAT WE

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:14.443
WOULD FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:16.578
IN WHICH WE CAN PARTNER.

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:18.113
NOT SIMPLY COMING TO BUDGET

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.648
COMMITTEE.

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.316
UP THROUGH APRIL FINANCE LETTERS

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:25.487
TO JAIL BC REQUEST BUT EVEN --

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.155
MEMBERSHIP ON THE STRIKE TEAM

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:30.092
SOME WAY IN WHICH WE ARE ENGAGED.

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:32.594
AND SO WHEN IT'S TIME THAT WE

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:33.562
HEAR THE PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.697
COMMITTEE QUITE FRANKLY YOU HAVE

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.232
ADVOCATES ON THIS SIDE OF THE

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:39.501
TABLE AS WELL PEOPLE WILL

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:40.702
PARTNER WITH YOU HAVE BEEN A

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.304
PART OF THE CONVERSATION.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:45.240
AND AND FEEL AND HAVE A SENSE OF

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:47.576
CONNECTION TO THE PROPOSED

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:49.378
RESOLUTIONS I FULLY APPRECIATE

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:51.580
THAT THAT MAY BE A DIFFERENT WAY

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:54.216
IN WHICH A STRIKE TEAM THE

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:56.051
ADMINISTRATION FINANCE IN THE

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:57.019
LEGISLATURE.

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:59.621
WORKS TOGETHER BUT AS YOU SAID

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.490
THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SET OF

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:04.993
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IMPACTS EVERY

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:06.261
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT.

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:07.496
THAT WAS THE POINT OF MICHAEL

01:16:07.562 --> 01:16:08.730
QUESTION BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.599
THINK CREATIVELY AS WELL IN

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:13.168
TERMS OF HOW YOU ENGAGE US.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:16.371
ON THE FRONT IN TO PARTNER WITH

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:18.807
YOU IN IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS AND

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:20.175
ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THEM

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:22.277
APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE THE

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.845
INNOVATIVE THINKING INTO AND DO.

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:24.780
OUR FIRST SENATOR MINING

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:29.584
FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DERIVE SO.

WANT TO THANK THE PRESENTERS SIN --

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:38.193

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.995
TIM IS BAD TEACHER FOR YEAR

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:41.730

IT'S APPRECIATED.

01:16:43.598 --> 01:16:47.302
LET ME JUST PREFACE MY QUESTIONS --

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:48.136
WE DO HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:50.939
OF FRUSTRATIONS AND COMPLAINTS

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:51.540
WE TRY IT.

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:54.376

01:16:58.547 --> 01:16:59.648
SERVICE THEY HAVE RECEIVED SO I

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.583
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:03.652
AT THE BIG PICTURE IN THE BIG

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:05.487
CHALLENGES -- THAT THERE ARE A

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:07.723
LOT OF DEDICATED STAFF THAT ARE

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.291
TRYING TO MAKE.

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:11.860
A TOUGH SITUATION BETTER INDEED --

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:13.328

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:17.532
A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE REAL ID --

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:18.633
WE HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:23.772
CONSTITUENTS WHO WENT TO THE DMV.

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:25.674

THAT DOCUMENTATION.

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:31.780
PERHAPS WASN'T SUFFICIENT

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.815

LARGELY THROUGH REAL ID I

THAT RELY DE APPLICATION.

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:32.240

INTERFACE BETWEEN THE APPLICANT

THIS FORWARD. ONE OF THE REASONS

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.633

BY THE CUSTOMER OKAY ANSWERING I

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:55.496
THINK IT'S IT'S USUALLY AROUND

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:58.299
ONE OR 2% I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:28:58.366 --> 01:28:59.434
DIFFERS.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.435
IN IN THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS

IT'S TWO POINT 7%.

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:05.873

LIKE REFER TO DO.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.295
WHY DO WE GIVE THEM THE

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:29.130
EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO A

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:30.264

RECOGNIZING WE HAD TWENTY THREE

02:01:05.224 --> 02:01:06.459
POINT MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE

02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:07.994
NEED REAL ID WAS THERE A

02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:10.496
SIMPLIFIED PROCESS THAT WE COULD

02:01:10.563 --> 02:01:10.763
EXERCISE.

02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:11.964
WE SAW THAT THE STATE OF

02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:13.866
WISCONSIN HAD ACTUALLY SELECTED

02:01:13.933 --> 02:01:16.369
A SINGLE RESIDENCY DOCUMENT --

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:17.637
IN ADDITION TO THE ALL OF THE

02:01:17.703 --> 02:01:19.505
OTHER DOCUMENTS WE THOUGHT THAT

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:20.773
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:21.374
WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE THE SAME

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.508
PATH.

02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:24.910
SO WE DID THAT -- AND SO WE HAVE

02:01:24.977 --> 02:01:26.178
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:27.780
ASKED TO BRING IN ONE RESIDENCY

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:29.582
DOCUMENT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED

02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:32.118
OUT IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE

02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:33.052
THEN HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:34.387
OF HOMELAND SECURITY THAT THAT

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:36.122
WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE THAT IT

02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:37.490
WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE

02:01:37.556 --> 02:01:38.791
EVERYBODY BRING IN. TWO

02:01:38.858 --> 02:01:41.027
RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS SO THEN WE

02:01:41.093 --> 02:01:43.195
WENT ABOUT WITH THE RECODING AND

02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:45.131
REPROCESSING EVERYTHING THAT WE

02:01:45.197 --> 02:01:47.667
NEED TO DO -- THAT AS OF APRIL

02:01:47.733 --> 02:01:49.535
TWENTY NINTH AND GOING FORWARD

02:01:49.602 --> 02:01:51.404
WE ARE ACCEPTING TO RESIDENCY

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:52.371
DOCUMENTS I WILL SAY BETWEEN

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:53.706
JANUARY AND APRIL TWENTY NINTH

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:54.607
WE'VE HAD.

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:56.509
A NUMBER OF FOLKS ALREADY BRING

02:01:56.575 --> 02:01:57.043
IN THEIR SECOND RESIDENCY%

02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:59.145
DOCUMENT THERE WAS A QUESTION OF

02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:00.446
HOW WOULD WE REACH OUT TO THESE

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:01.447
INDIVIDUALS.

02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:02.648
WHO I REFER TO AS OUR EARLY

02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:04.750
ADOPTERS WHO CAME IN AHEAD OF

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:06.285
TIME TO GET THE REAL ID?

02:02:06.352 --> 02:02:08.487
AND SO WE HAVE ABOUT THREE POINT

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:09.655
ONE THREE POINT TWO MILLION OF

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.891
THOSE WHO HAVEN'T -- PROVIDE AS

02:02:11.957 --> 02:02:13.559
A SECOND ROSY DOCUMENT OUR GOAL

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:15.861
IS WE CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY ALL

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.863
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND SENDING

02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:19.465
MAILER OUT TO THEM.

02:02:19.532 --> 02:02:20.566
AND THE MAILER ITSELF WILL

02:02:20.633 --> 02:02:23.302
CONSTITUTE A STATE DOCUMENT THAT

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:24.737
THEY CAN THEN BASICALLY CHECK

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:27.440
AND SIGN OFF VERIFYING THAT THIS

02:02:27.506 --> 02:02:28.808
IS THE INDIVIDUAL STILL THEY

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:30.276
HAVEN'T MOVED IF THEY'VE MOVED.

02:02:30.342 --> 02:02:31.644
WILL HAVE TO ACTUALLY PURSUE A

02:02:31.711 --> 02:02:33.345
DIFFERENT PATH WITH THEM BUT IF

02:02:33.412 --> 02:02:34.513
THEY HAVE NOT MOVED THEY CAN

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:37.583
ACTUALLY MAIL THAT DOCUMENT BACK

02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:37.817
TO US.

02:02:37.883 --> 02:02:39.118
AND WE WILL CLUE POSTAGE FREE

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:40.619
ENVELOPES FOR THEM OR WE'RE

02:02:40.686 --> 02:02:42.488
LOOKING AT ALSO HAVING THEM DROP

02:02:42.555 --> 02:02:44.290
IT OFF -- AT A DMV OFFICE MY

02:02:44.356 --> 02:02:46.625
GOAL IN THIS EXERCISE IS TO NOT

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:48.994
HAVING COME BACK TO A DMV OFFICE.

02:02:49.061 --> 02:02:50.062
I DON'T NEED THAT FOOT TRAFFIC

02:02:50.129 --> 02:02:52.264
COMING IN I WANT TO SIMPLIFY

02:02:52.331 --> 02:02:53.666
THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR

02:02:53.733 --> 02:02:56.102
THESE INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW THAT

02:02:56.168 --> 02:02:57.269
ONE OF THE RESIDENT ARGUMENTS

02:02:57.336 --> 02:02:59.071
THAT QUALIFIES IS A STATE ISSUE

02:02:59.138 --> 02:03:02.108
DOCUMENT.

02:03:02.174 --> 02:03:03.642
SO WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DMV STATE

02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:05.111
ISSUE DOCUMENT QUALIFIES FOR

02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:05.678
THAT STATE ISSUE DOCUMENT.

02:03:05.745 --> 02:03:07.446
AND IS THE SIMPLEST WAY WE CAN

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:08.481
HANDLE THAT.

02:03:08.547 --> 02:03:10.282
WE ARE WORKING ALL THE THE THE

02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:12.318
DATA PULL DOWN SO OUR GOAL IS

02:03:12.384 --> 02:03:14.253
PROBABLY THIS SUMMER EARLY THIS

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:16.021
SUMMER I THINK THE GOAL IS. TO

02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:17.490
SEND OUT OUR MAILING TO ALL

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:19.225
THESE INDIVIDUALS NOW THE GOOD

02:03:19.291 --> 02:03:20.726
NEWS FOR FOLKS -- I THINK

02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:22.895
SOMEBODY ASKED IN TWO YEARS WILL

02:03:22.962 --> 02:03:24.396
THEY HAVE A FEDERALLY NON

02:03:24.463 --> 02:03:25.297
COMPLIANT CARD.

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:27.299
THE DMV IN ITS LETTER -- TO

02:03:27.366 --> 02:03:28.734
GOVERNOR NEWSOME -- BASICALLY

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.503
OUTLINED THE FACT THAT WE WOULD

02:03:30.569 --> 02:03:32.705
HAVE THROUGH THE RENEWAL CYCLE

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.240
FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL SO THEY MAY

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:35.241
HAVE FIVE PLUS YEARS FROM A

02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:36.675
RENEWAL CYCLE DEPENDING ON IT.

02:03:36.742 --> 02:03:37.810
TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THEIR SECOND

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:39.612
RAZZIE DOCUMENT OF COURSE IF

02:03:39.678 --> 02:03:40.646
THEY WANT TO COME IN AND HAVE

02:03:40.713 --> 02:03:42.481
THE RENEWAL CYCLE WE WOULD BE

02:03:42.548 --> 02:03:44.350
HAPPY TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE END

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:45.451
OF THEIR SECOND RESIDENT

02:03:45.518 --> 02:03:47.219
DOCUMENT. ONE OF THESE WILL HAVE

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:48.420
TO FIGURE OUT IS WHEN WE GET TO

02:03:48.487 --> 02:03:49.955
INDIVIDUALS RENEWAL CYCLE HOW

02:03:50.022 --> 02:03:51.557
CAN WE MAKE SURE.

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:53.592
THAT THEY ARE ON NOTICE THAT WE-DON'T HAVE THEIR SECOND

02:03:53.659 --> 02:03:55.594
RESIDENCY DOCUMENT OUR THOUGHT

02:03:55.661 --> 02:03:57.396
IS MUCH LIKE WE DO SMALL TESTS

02:03:57.463 --> 02:03:58.931
OR OTHER THINGS.

02:03:58.998 --> 02:04:00.399
IS MAKE SURE WHEN THAT RENEWAL

02:04:00.466 --> 02:04:02.501
NOTICES GOING OUT IS CLEARLY

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:03.736
SIGNALS THAT A SECOND ROSY

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:05.404
DOCUMENTS STILL REQUIRED FOR

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:07.006
THEM SO THAT THEY CAN STILL HAVE.

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:11.410
THEIR FEDERICA POINT CARD SO WE

02:04:11.477 --> 02:04:11.944
ARE WORKING THROUGH THOSE

02:04:12.011 --> 02:04:12.678
PROCESSES.

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:14.446
I SEEM TO RECALL FOLKS ASKING

02:04:14.513 --> 02:04:15.314
MORE THAN JUST TO FOLLOW QUITE

02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:17.449
YES DOES THE NOTE YOU HAVE MY

02:04:17.516 --> 02:04:18.551
HOPE MEMBERS AND REMEMBER THAT

02:04:18.617 --> 02:04:19.084
IT.

02:04:19.151 --> 02:04:20.753
WAS ANOTHER QUESTIONS RELATED --

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:21.987
TO BUT IT'S BEEN PROGRAM AND SO

02:04:22.054 --> 02:04:22.788
THE DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE A

02:04:22.855 --> 02:04:24.590
SENIOR OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AS WELL

02:04:24.657 --> 02:04:26.192
AND SO WE INTERACT WITH WITH THE

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:29.094
THE THE SENIOR COMMUNITIES

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:30.496
THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

02:04:30.563 --> 02:04:31.063
AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:31.664
QUESTION AS RELATES TO WHAT

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:32.965
SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS AND AND THE

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:35.401
ACTING DIRECTOR HAD MENTIONED --

02:04:35.467 --> 02:04:36.302
PRIMARILY -- FOR MAJORITY THE

02:04:36.368 --> 02:04:38.103
CUSTOMER THE DOCUMENTS FOR REAL

02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:40.806
ID ARE -- TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:42.474
A MUSCLE SECURITY NUMBER WHETHER

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:44.176
EITHER BUSINESS CREDIT CARD OR

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:45.511
W. TO THE HAS THE FULL NUMBER ON

02:04:45.578 --> 02:04:45.911
IT.

02:04:45.978 --> 02:04:47.847
I'M ALONG WITH IDENTITY DOCUMENT

02:04:47.913 --> 02:04:48.848
AND THEN THAT IF YOU HAVE A AND

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:50.749
A NAME CHANGE HAS MENTIONED --

02:04:50.816 --> 02:04:52.585
JUST THE MAPPING ASSOCIATED WITH

02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:53.485
THAT NAME CHANGE.

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:55.654
THING I'D I WANT TO ADD ON IS

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:56.589
THE ACTING DIRECTOR HAD

02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:59.058
MENTIONED ABOUT THE SINGLE --

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:00.025
RESIDENTS ARE ACCURATE THAT WE

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:01.327
WENT FORWARD WITH THAT WASN'T

02:05:01.393 --> 02:05:03.095
APPROVED PROCESS BY HOMELAND

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:05.197
SECURITY -- IT WASN'T IN REGARDS

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:06.332
TO WHAT'S GOING FORWARD WITH

02:05:06.398 --> 02:05:07.199
THAT JUST BECAUSE WISCONSIN HAD

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:08.601
DONE IT WISCONSIN WAS BEING

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:10.803
COMPLY WITH REAL ID WE ENGAGED

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:13.005
HOMELAND SECURITY THAT WE WANTED

02:05:13.072 --> 02:05:14.473
TO INCORPORATE THAT SAME PROCESS.

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.575
AND AND SO THEY HAD IDENTIFIED

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:17.543
SO THAT THAT WAS OKAY AT THAT

02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:18.110
TIME.

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:19.078
SO SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE THEIR

02:05:19.144 --> 02:05:20.512
SOCIAL SECURITY CARD BUT THEY

02:05:20.579 --> 02:05:21.614
KNOW THEIR NUMBER IS THAT

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:22.915
ADEQUATE ARE YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT

02:05:22.982 --> 02:05:28.654
PRINTED ON SOMETHING IT

02:05:28.721 --> 02:05:29.555
PHYSICALLY HAVE TO BE ON A

02:05:29.622 --> 02:05:30.155
DOCUMENT. FOR A FEDERAL

02:05:30.222 --> 02:05:31.090
REQUIREMENT THE FULL NUMBER NOT

02:05:31.156 --> 02:05:31.724
JUST THE LAST FOUR DIGITS AND

02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:32.358
THAT'S A GREAT POINT THAT WAS

02:05:32.424 --> 02:05:32.992
ANOTHER THING THAT WE ACTUALLY

02:05:33.058 --> 02:05:33.659
TRIED TO PUSH BACK ON EARLY ON

02:05:33.726 --> 02:05:35.027
AS AN EARLY I'M FOR REAL ID.

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:35.861
IS THAT WE ACTUALLYDO

02:05:35.928 --> 02:05:37.329
ELECTRONIC VERIFICATION OF SOUL

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:38.497
STURDY NUMBERS THROUGH THE

02:05:38.564 --> 02:05:40.399
SUBSTRATE ADMINISTRATION AND WE

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:42.234
TRY TO BOMB.

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:43.569
A SEPARATE BACK BUT ENGAGE WITH

02:05:43.636 --> 02:05:44.803
HOMELAND SECURITY AND SAY THIS

02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:46.405
IS THE PROCESS WE DO TODAY WHY

02:05:46.472 --> 02:05:47.706
DO WE NEED TO BRING IN A

02:05:47.773 --> 02:05:48.874
PHYSICAL DOCUMENT.

02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:49.375
THEY HAD SAID IT WAS A

02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:52.177
REQUIREMENT THE REGULATIONS AND

02:05:52.244 --> 02:05:54.313
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO CHANGE IT.

02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:55.481
SENATOR A THING MENSURAL I

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:57.616
HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE WHO

02:05:57.683 --> 02:05:59.451
HAS A REAL ID WITH.

02:05:59.518 --> 02:06:00.753
ONE RESIDENTS VERIFICATION

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:02.588
DOCUMENT.

02:06:02.655 --> 02:06:05.224
SO IT EXACTLY HOW TO Y..

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:06.392
WELL I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW YET

02:06:06.458 --> 02:06:07.526
BUT I'D I WOULD HOPE THAT I

02:06:07.593 --> 02:06:08.594
WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:10.729
DMV AND DROP OFF A DOCUMENT I

02:06:10.796 --> 02:06:11.597
WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE A

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:14.633
WAY TO AYE THE MAIL TO YOU.

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:17.336
OR UPLOAD IT SOMEHOW TO YOU.

02:06:17.403 --> 02:06:17.903
SO YOU COULD HAVE IT IN YOUR

02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:22.508
FILE -- AND HAVE ME AVOID THE

02:06:22.574 --> 02:06:24.410
APPOINTMENT PROCESS NOT THAT IT

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:26.512
WAS PAINFUL I WENT TO MY LOCAL

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:29.081
OFFICE AND IT WAS JUST FINE --

02:06:29.148 --> 02:06:30.349
BUT WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL

02:06:30.416 --> 02:06:32.618
HAVE THAT PROCESS NAIL DOWN SO I

02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:33.585
DON'T.

02:06:33.652 --> 02:06:37.089
FORGET AND WAIT TO MY RENEWAL --

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:39.291
SO AGAIN -- WE THE GOAL IS AND

02:06:39.358 --> 02:06:40.526
SOME LETTERS OUT EARLY THIS

02:06:40.592 --> 02:06:41.794
SUMMER TO ALL THOSE THAT

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.462
ACTUALLY HAVE ALREADY GONE

02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:43.729
THROUGH.

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:45.230
THE REAL ID PROCESS AND HAVE A

02:06:45.297 --> 02:06:46.765
SINGLE RESIDENCY DOCUMENT THAT

02:06:46.832 --> 02:06:48.067
THEY PROVIDE AND AGAIN OUR

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:49.635
PREFERENCES THAT WE'RE GONNA

02:06:49.702 --> 02:06:52.538
SEND A STATE ISSUED DOCUMENT

THE POSSIBILITY OF UPLOADING I

02:07:03.983 --> 02:07:06.285
THINK THAT GETS TO THE HEART OF

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:08.053
THE WORK THAT IT CREATES BACK IN

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:09.588
OUR OFFICES WITH OURS THE

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:11.156

THAT THROUGH OUR TECHNOLOGY

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:14.026

FOLKS THEY MAY WANT TO DROP IT

HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT CODING

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:03.542
THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO IT

02:13:03.608 --> 02:13:05.610
BECOMES A DOMINO EFFECT IN

02:13:05.677 --> 02:13:06.745
REGARDS TO HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE

02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:07.846
THE CODING.

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:09.548
AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE RUN

02:13:09.614 --> 02:13:11.416
INTO IS A LOT OF TIMES --

02:13:11.483 --> 02:13:13.652
BECAUSE OF THE THE BENEFICIAL

02:13:13.719 --> 02:13:15.320
NATURE OF THE LEGISLATION.

02:13:15.387 --> 02:13:17.456
THAT HS -- IMPLEMENTATION DATES

02:13:17.522 --> 02:13:19.291
THAT ARE EITHER COMING UP YOU

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:19.925
KNOW SIX MONTHS FROM THE FROM

02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:21.927
PASSAGE OR A LOT OF TIMES ARE

02:13:21.993 --> 02:13:23.195
LEGISLATIVE OFFICE TRIES TO WORK

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:24.529
DIRECTLY WITH.

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:25.864
THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES FOR

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:27.232
DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATES I

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:28.533
THINK THE BIGGEST THING OF

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:29.968
BENEFIT FOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT

02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:30.502
WOULD BE.

02:13:30.569 --> 02:13:32.471
IN REGARD TO THAT IS GOING BACK

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:33.672
TO THE COMMUNICATION IT'S MORE

02:13:33.739 --> 02:13:35.107
THAN JUST COMMUNICATION EVEN ON

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:36.608
THIS STUFF IT'S COMMUNICATION ON

02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:39.111

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:03.902
CLEARLY ARTICULATED AS A RESULT

02:14:03.969 --> 02:14:04.870
OF THE AUDIT.

SO HOW ARE YOU [inaudible]

02:14:12.544 --> 02:14:13.678
BALANCING.

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:15.580
SO GREAT QUESTION -- AND ANYONE

02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:17.549
INNINGS I WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE --

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:19.184
LEARNED AND BEING THERE I'M IN

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:21.653
AND I AGREE WITH THE FINDINGS OF

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.422
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SAY.

02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:24.956
IS SOME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

02:14:25.023 --> 02:14:26.324
WERE CHALLENGE WITH A RELEASE OF

02:14:26.391 --> 02:14:28.059
SAY WITH THIS SYSTEMIC ISSUES AT

02:14:28.126 --> 02:14:29.694
THE DMV AS YOU'VE POINTED OUT.

02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:31.596
HOWEVER -- WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE

02:14:31.663 --> 02:14:33.131
AN IMMEDIATE NEED WE HAVE TO

02:14:33.198 --> 02:14:34.599
ADDRESS WITH RELATING.

02:14:34.666 --> 02:14:36.968

YOU TO SUPPORT -- BRINGING IN

02:14:38.136 --> 02:14:40.172
PEOPLE BUT BRINGING IN PEOPLE IS

02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:41.640
NEVER A LONG TERM ANSWER.

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:43.275
BRINGING IN PEOPLE'S ADDRESSING

02:14:43.341 --> 02:14:44.576
A SHORT TERM DEMAND THAT WE ARE

02:14:44.643 --> 02:14:46.278
GOING TO BE FACING OVER AT LEAST

02:14:46.344 --> 02:14:47.446
THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

02:14:47.512 --> 02:14:49.648
I ANTICIPATE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE

02:14:49.714 --> 02:14:51.616
HAVE THE OCTOBER ONE TWENTY

02:14:51.683 --> 02:14:53.318
TWENTY TIME FRAME WILL PROBABLY

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:55.053
ACTUALLY HAVE A TAIL AFTER THAT.

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:55.787
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE A LOT OF

02:14:55.854 --> 02:14:57.222
PEOPLE THAT WAKE UP ONE MORNING

02:14:57.289 --> 02:14:58.123
AND SAY.

02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.491
YOU KNOW MAYBE I NEED TO GET

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:00.258
THAT REAL ID I DON'T WANT TO

TAKE MY PASSPORT WITH ME ALL THE

02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:02.627
TIME.

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:04.896
SO I WOULD SAY GOING TO TWENTY

02:15:04.963 --> 02:15:05.730
TWENTY ONE WILL HAVE A LOT OF

02:15:05.797 --> 02:15:08.600
ACTIVITY -- BUT I WHERE I'M

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:09.968
FOCUSED AND I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF

02:15:10.035 --> 02:15:11.636
TAKEN THIS APPROACH EVEN SERVING

02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:12.971
IN THE GULF OFFICE AGENCIES THE

02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:14.739
DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT.

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:16.408
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

02:15:16.475 --> 02:15:18.276
ORGANIZATION AS TO WHAT I CALL

02:15:18.343 --> 02:15:19.611
THE THREE LEAVES THE STORE.

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:21.513
THE WORK FORCE IN THE WORK FORCE

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:22.747
HAS TO GO THROUGH TREES REMOTE

02:15:22.814 --> 02:15:24.649
TRANSFORMATION BUSINESS

02:15:24.716 --> 02:15:27.786
PROCESSES WE HAVE MANY BUSINESS

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:29.654
LINES IN FACT I WOULD SAY OF ALL

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:31.156
THE DEPARTMENTS I'VE HAD TO WORK

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:32.357
WITH THE DMV IS.

02:15:32.424 --> 02:15:34.159
YOU KNOW MOST LIKE A RETAIL

02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:36.561
OUTLET IN THAT IT SO HOUSE MANY

02:15:36.628 --> 02:15:38.129
PRODUCT LINES THAT IT SERVES.

02:15:38.196 --> 02:15:39.197
AND WE HAVE TO DO A BUSINESS

02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:41.433
PROCESS ASSESSMENT REALLY AROUND

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:42.100
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE

02:15:42.167 --> 02:15:43.401
PRODUCT LINES WHETHER IT'S MOTOR

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:45.937
CARRIER PERMITS DRIVER'S LICENSE.

02:15:46.004 --> 02:15:46.938
MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS

02:15:47.005 --> 02:15:49.074
TILING ALL OF THEM WE NEED A

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:50.442
DIVE INTO A LOOK AT THOSE

02:15:50.509 --> 02:15:52.477
BUSINESS PROCESSES AND THEN

02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:52.911
THERE'S TECHNOLOGY

02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:55.614
TRANSFORMATION -- I THINK WHAT I

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.183
LOOK WHEN I SEE DMV I SEE AN

02:15:58.250 --> 02:16:00.418
ORGANIZATION THAT WE HAVE DONE --

02:16:00.485 --> 02:16:02.954
DEFERRED MODERNIZATION OF DMV

02:16:03.021 --> 02:16:05.490
FOR MANY YEARS I MEAN WHEN I SEE

02:16:05.557 --> 02:16:07.225
THAT WE ARE RUNNING A SIMILAR

02:16:07.292 --> 02:16:09.561
CODE WHICH IS SO OUTDATED IT'S

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:13.965
EVEN BEFORE COLD ALL CODE AND WE

02:16:14.032 --> 02:16:16.067
HAVE CALL BOB CODE -- AND I LOOK

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:16.735
AT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE NOT

02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:18.169
NIMBLE WE ARE NOT AND CHILD.

02:16:18.236 --> 02:16:19.271
AND WE AND WE DO A CODE CHANGE

02:16:19.337 --> 02:16:22.474
IT TAKES SOMETIMES MONTHS TO DO

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:22.941
GO THROUGH THE TESTING

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:24.676
ENVIRONMENT BUT WE'RE OFTENTIMES

02:16:24.743 --> 02:16:26.311
GIVEN A VERY SHORT DURATION TO

02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:27.979
BRING SOMETHING UP WHICH MEANS

02:16:28.046 --> 02:16:30.382
WE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS THERE WILL

02:16:30.448 --> 02:16:31.182
BE SOME.

02:16:31.249 --> 02:16:34.519
GLITCHES IN THE SYSTEM -- BUT I

02:16:34.586 --> 02:16:35.186
WILL SHARE WITH YOU BECAUSE THIS

02:16:35.253 --> 02:16:36.154
CAME UP.

02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:37.722
EARLIER TO QUESTIONS HOW DO WE

02:16:37.789 --> 02:16:39.858
COMPARE WITH ALL THE OTHER

02:16:39.925 --> 02:16:40.825
STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT ARE

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:42.093
HANDLING THE SIGNIFICANT

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.595
CHALLENGE. ONE OF THE

02:16:43.662 --> 02:16:45.597
ORGANIZATIONS I BECOME FAMILIAR

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:46.598
WITH AND THEY ARE A GREAT

02:16:46.665 --> 02:16:48.733
RESOURCE TO US INTO ALL OUR

02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:49.834
NEIGHBORING STATES.

02:16:49.901 --> 02:16:51.436
IS THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF

02:16:51.503 --> 02:16:53.104
MOTOR VEHICLE DMINISTRATORS.

02:16:53.171 --> 02:16:55.473
IT IS ACTUALLY A GROUP OF FOLKS

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.275
AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT DO MOTOR

02:16:57.342 --> 02:16:59.177
VEHICLE OR DRIVER'S LICENSE

02:16:59.244 --> 02:17:00.812
ADMINISTRATION.

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:02.547
AND WHAT I FIND FASCINATING IS A

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:05.183
COUPLE YEARS AGO THEY ISSUED A

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:06.718
LARGE BUSINESS PLAN AROUND

02:17:06.785 --> 02:17:09.554
TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FOR ALL

02:17:09.621 --> 02:17:10.255
DMV'S.

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:11.523
IF YOU ACTUALLY DO ANY KIND OF

02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:12.657
GOOGLE SEARCH YOU'LL FIND A

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:14.125
NUMBER OF OUR STATES THAT ARE

02:17:14.192 --> 02:17:15.961
EMBARKING UPON TECHNOLOGY

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:18.863
MODERNIZATION FOR THEIR DIEM --

02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:21.099
I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU THERE IS

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:22.801
THE ISSUE AROUND.

02:17:22.867 --> 02:17:24.536
THE REPUTATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE

02:17:24.603 --> 02:17:26.104
ORGANIZATIONS THEY'VE JUST

02:17:26.171 --> 02:17:27.906
ISSUED ANOTHER PAPER GUIDING

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:29.507
MOTOR VEHICLE ORGANIZATIONS ON

02:17:29.574 --> 02:17:31.343
HOW TO BUILD REPUTATIONS.

02:17:31.409 --> 02:17:33.912
IN THEIR STATES -- ANOTHER

02:17:33.979 --> 02:17:36.247
REALLY INTERESTING -- ONE IS

02:17:36.314 --> 02:17:38.216
WITH THE CARDS TO JUST I I THINK

02:17:38.283 --> 02:17:41.019
RE IMAGINING THE DMV FOR EVERY

02:17:41.086 --> 02:17:41.252
STATE.

02:17:41.319 --> 02:17:42.454
I THINK WE REALLY HAVE BEEN

02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:43.788
CAUGHT UP IN I ALMOST A

02:17:43.855 --> 02:17:45.790
BORDERLINE NINETEENTH CENTURY

02:17:45.857 --> 02:17:47.459
MODEL OF DOING BUSINESS.

02:17:47.525 --> 02:17:49.961
MY MANTRA WITH STAFF IS THAT

02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:51.496
THIS JOURNEY IS ABOUT US MOVING

02:17:51.563 --> 02:17:54.165
FROM OUR GRANDPARENTS DMV TO OUR

02:17:54.232 --> 02:17:55.600
CHILDREN'S DMV.

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:57.002
AND I THINK SOMEBODY ALLUDE TO

02:17:57.068 --> 02:17:59.070
THE FACT THE DMV IS REALLY

02:17:59.137 --> 02:18:00.405
BLESSED WITH A LOT OF VERY

02:18:00.472 --> 02:18:02.607
CARING AND PASSIONATE EMPLOYEES.

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:04.309
IN MY JOB AND MY ACTING ROLE

02:18:04.376 --> 02:18:05.977
HERE IS TO MAKE SURE I GIVE THEM

02:18:06.044 --> 02:18:07.078
THE TOOLS.

02:18:07.145 --> 02:18:08.513
AND THE TRAINING TO BE AS

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:17.122
SUCCESSFUL AS THEY CAN BE IN

02:18:17.188 --> 02:18:18.657
THIS MODERN AGE OF DELIVERING ON

02:18:18.723 --> 02:18:18.990
OUR MISSION.

02:18:19.057 --> 02:18:19.658
I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I

02:18:19.724 --> 02:18:20.191
FIND INTERESTING IS IF YOU

02:18:20.258 --> 02:18:20.992
GOOGLE EVERY STATE IN THE NATION

02:18:21.059 --> 02:18:21.626
IS FACING ISSUES AROUND REAL

02:18:21.693 --> 02:18:22.260
IDEA PROCESSING TIME I SAW AN

02:18:22.327 --> 02:18:22.527
ARTICLE.

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:23.395
RECENTLY IN TEXAS THE WHERE THEY

02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:25.030
WERE ENCOUNTERING FOR A FIVE

02:18:25.096 --> 02:18:27.198
HOUR WAITS -- I KNOW THAT THE

02:18:27.265 --> 02:18:28.733
STATE OF KENTUCKY RECENTLY IS

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:30.602
DELAYING THEIR ACTIVITY BECAUSE

02:18:30.669 --> 02:18:33.138
OF SOME SYSTEM ISSUES -- SO IT

02:18:33.204 --> 02:18:35.507
GOES ON AND ON EVERY SINGLE ONE

02:18:35.573 --> 02:18:36.408
OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE

02:18:36.474 --> 02:18:37.208
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE OF

02:18:37.275 --> 02:18:39.744
CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS.

02:18:39.811 --> 02:18:41.913
THIS CHALLENGE BUT I WILL TELL

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:43.114
YOU IT'S A GREAT ENVIRONMENT FOR

02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:44.582
BEST PRACTICES SHARING A

DONE SOME INTERESTING WORK --

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:53.925
AND SO WE TRY TO LEARN FROM

02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:54.693
OTHER STATES AND SAY WHAT WOULD

02:18:54.759 --> 02:18:56.528
BE APPLICABLE AT THE SCALE WE

02:18:56.594 --> 02:18:58.029
NEED TO DO IT HERE.

02:18:58.096 --> 02:18:59.597
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO

02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:01.700

FIRST FOUR ROWS ON THAT PAGE

02:20:48.439 --> 02:20:49.774
HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE

02:20:49.841 --> 02:20:51.109
LEGISLATURE.

02:20:51.176 --> 02:20:52.877
I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE

02:20:52.944 --> 02:20:54.145
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PROPOSAL WAS

02:20:54.212 --> 02:20:55.680
ORIGINALLY A FIVE YEAR PROPOSAL

02:20:55.747 --> 02:20:57.148
BUT GIVEN THAT REAL ID WAS JUST

02:20:57.215 --> 02:20:58.183
STARTING THE LEGISLATURE

02:20:58.249 --> 02:20:59.818

THAT WE WILL BE BACK IN.

02:21:03.454 --> 02:21:04.022
NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH IS WHERE

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:05.824
WE ARE RIGHT NOW -- THE BY THE

02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:06.991

02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:17.735
THE LEGISLATURE COULD HOLD A

02:21:17.802 --> 02:21:19.637
HEARING ON THE MORE PRIDE ISSUES

02:21:19.704 --> 02:21:21.005
AGAIN MY WERE HERE TODAY.

02:21:21.072 --> 02:21:22.006
YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM --

02:21:22.073 --> 02:21:23.074

DIRECTOR WEB IS GIVING YOU A

02:21:24.442 --> 02:21:26.211
BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR SPRING

FINANCE LETTER -- BUT IS THIS

02:21:28.446 --> 02:21:30.081
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO

02:21:30.148 --> 02:21:31.382
MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION ON THE

02:21:31.449 --> 02:21:31.649
NUMBERS.

02:21:31.716 --> 02:21:33.551
ON THE AGENDA NOTES THE PROPOSAL

02:21:33.618 --> 02:21:37.822
AT FOUR HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND

02:21:37.889 --> 02:21:39.591
FORTY TWO MILLION -- ACTING

02:21:39.657 --> 02:21:40.859
DIRECTOR CITED TWO HUNDRED AND

02:21:40.925 --> 02:21:42.327
TWENTY SIX MILLION BOTH ARE

02:21:42.393 --> 02:21:42.594
CORRECT.

02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:44.596
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO

02:21:44.662 --> 02:21:46.564
NUMBERS IS -- THE PROPOSED

02:21:46.631 --> 02:21:48.633
REDUCTION OF NON MBA FUNDS TO

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:49.601
REFLECT THE PASSING THROUGH A

02:21:49.667 --> 02:21:52.036
CREDIT CARD CHARGES SO THAT IS

02:21:52.103 --> 02:21:52.670
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO

02:21:52.737 --> 02:21:53.571
NUMBERS.

02:21:53.638 --> 02:21:55.473
I ALSO NOTE THAT THE BUDGET

02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:56.774
AFTER TWENTY EIGHTEEN REQUIRES

02:21:56.841 --> 02:21:58.810
THE DMV TO SUBMIT MONTHLY WAIT

02:21:58.877 --> 02:22:00.845

AT LEAST DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST

02:22:04.515 --> 02:22:06.417
OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS AFTER

02:22:06.484 --> 02:22:07.919
THE OCTOBER ONE TWENTY POINT.

02:22:07.986 --> 02:22:08.953
EIGHT FUND THESE REPORTS INCLUDE

02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:10.688
NOT ONLY ARE WAIT TIMES BUT ALSO

02:22:10.755 --> 02:22:12.223
THEIR PROGRESS ON HIRING OF

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:14.225
POSITIONS AND SO THOSE ARE

02:22:14.292 --> 02:22:14.792
PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:22:14.859 --> 02:22:16.094

02:22:19.631 --> 02:22:21.266
PERCENTAGE OF REALIZED THE

02:22:21.332 --> 02:22:23.701
TRANSACTION SO WE WILL CONTINUE

02:22:23.768 --> 02:22:24.602
TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED

02:22:24.669 --> 02:22:26.504
THROUGH THIS MECHANISM AND WE'RE

02:22:26.571 --> 02:22:28.106

THE BILL.

02:22:34.512 --> 02:22:38.683
OF THIS.

02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:43.488
MOTOR VEHICLE COUNTY -- WHEN I

02:22:43.554 --> 02:22:45.523
LOOKED AT THE REPORTER THINK

OF ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS --

02:23:12.517 --> 02:23:14.118
I THINK.

02:23:14.185 --> 02:23:17.121
WHAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE IS --

02:23:17.188 --> 02:23:18.790
THE MOTOR VEHICLE CAL IS

02:23:18.856 --> 02:23:21.626
STRUCTURALLY UNBALANCED.

02:23:21.693 --> 02:23:22.427

WHAT WAS THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT

02:23:27.398 --> 02:23:28.299
GONNA LOOK LIKE.

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:35.340
MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN

02:23:35.406 --> 02:23:37.041
OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT.

02:23:37.108 --> 02:23:41.713
IS IT GOING TO REQUIRE -- FEE

02:23:41.779 --> 02:23:43.848
INCREASES AND OTHER KINDS OF

02:23:43.915 --> 02:23:45.950
REVENUE THAT -- WE DON'T KNOW

02:23:48.519 --> 02:23:49.821
ISSUE.

02:23:49.887 --> 02:23:51.489
CERTAINLY SAYS AS PART IN THE

02:23:51.556 --> 02:23:52.724

EXPENDITURES -- IF YOU LOOK AT

02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:04.702

THEY ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST SO

02:25:21.345 --> 02:25:25.216
WHAT WOULD THE THE MOTOR VEHICLE

02:25:25.283 --> 02:25:26.584
COUNT BY HAVING MORE

IT'S LIKE YOU WANT TO INCREASE

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:02.887
IT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:04.522
DRIVERS YOU HAVE OUT THERE THE

02:26:04.589 --> 02:26:06.624
NUMBER OF OF THE POPULATION OF

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:11.596
THE STATE -- THINGS LIKE YOUR

02:26:11.662 --> 02:26:13.798
ACCIDENT RATES.

02:26:13.865 --> 02:26:15.833
TRYING TO REDUCE SAFETY.

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:18.136
SO SO I'M KIND OF WONDERING HOW

02:26:18.202 --> 02:26:20.771
IT IS -- SPENDING IN THE MOTOR

02:26:20.838 --> 02:26:24.609
VEHICLE COUNTY -- AFFECT THE

02:26:24.675 --> 02:26:26.744
HIGHWAY PATROL.

02:26:26.811 --> 02:26:32.984
BUDGET OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD.

02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:34.418
SO WE LOOK AT ALL DEPARTMENTS

02:26:34.485 --> 02:26:36.354
BUDGETS EACH YEAR -- AS I SAID

02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:38.656
DURING ON YOUR CURRENT FORECASTS

02:26:38.723 --> 02:26:39.557
[inaudible]

02:26:39.624 --> 02:26:42.860
THE NBA WOULD DROP TO A LOW OF A

02:26:42.927 --> 02:26:43.895
HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION SO IF

02:26:43.961 --> 02:26:45.530
YOU WANTED TO FOR INCREASED.

02:26:45.596 --> 02:26:47.231
EXPENDITURES BEYOND THOSE THAT

02:26:47.298 --> 02:26:49.400
HAVE BEEN PROPOSED.

02:26:49.467 --> 02:26:51.169
THUS FAR FOR THE HIGHWAY PATROL --

02:26:51.235 --> 02:26:52.370
YOU WOULD EITHER BE DIPPING INTO

02:26:52.436 --> 02:26:54.405
THAT RESERVE OR YOU WOULD HAVE

02:26:54.472 --> 02:26:56.507
TO ADJUST OTHER EXPENDITURES OR

02:26:56.574 --> 02:26:59.443
REVENUE SOURCES FOR THE ONE

02:26:59.510 --> 02:27:01.379
FIFTY FIVE RESERVE.

02:27:01.445 --> 02:27:03.014
IS OVER A LIKE -- FOUR AND A

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:05.750
HALF BILLION DOLLAR FUND.

02:27:05.816 --> 02:27:06.350
THAT'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE

02:27:06.417 --> 02:27:07.385
MILLION.

02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:09.153
OF RESERVES ON A FOR HALF

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:11.322
BILLION DOLLARS MOTOR VEHICLE

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:12.356
FUND RIGHT.

02:27:12.423 --> 02:27:14.392
PRACTICE LESS IT IS.

02:27:14.458 --> 02:27:17.495
LESS A SADDLE VERY SMALL RESERVE

02:27:17.562 --> 02:27:17.995
YES.

02:27:18.062 --> 02:27:19.931
WE LIKE 55% RESERVE WHICH WOULD

02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:21.465
BE CLOSER TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION

02:27:21.532 --> 02:27:23.501
HOWEVER THE CHP AND DMV

02:27:23.568 --> 02:27:25.536
HISTORICALLY HAVE MANAGED.

02:27:25.603 --> 02:27:26.337
ON AS LOW AS A HUNDRED MILLION

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:28.239
DOLLAR RESERVE WE WOULD PREFER

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:30.208
OBVIOUSLY HIGHER RESERVE BUT IN

02:27:30.274 --> 02:27:31.609
ORDER TO FIND ALL OF THE THE

02:27:31.676 --> 02:27:33.211
NEEDS WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING THE

02:27:33.277 --> 02:27:34.278

02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:56.634
PERIOD.

02:27:56.701 --> 02:27:57.768
BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS

02:27:57.835 --> 02:27:58.970
THAT WOULD NOT BE NEEDED

02:27:59.036 --> 02:27:59.270

02:28:47.084 --> 02:28:48.085

NEED GOING FORWARD.

02:28:55.893 --> 02:28:57.194
WE'RE GOING TO DERIVE THAT FROM

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:59.730
THE GENERAL FUND.

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:02.667
IN THE C. P. OR HOW DO YOU

02:29:02.733 --> 02:29:05.036
INTEND TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

02:29:05.102 --> 02:29:07.505
SO OUR CURRENT PLAN -- DOES NOT

02:29:07.571 --> 02:29:09.373

02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:11.075
FUND TRANSFERS.

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:13.077
INTO THE NBA IT DOES NOT

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:14.178
ANTICIPATE A FEE INCREASE IT

02:29:14.245 --> 02:29:15.479
DOES NOT AT THE MOMENT

02:29:15.546 --> 02:29:15.780
ANTICIPATE.

02:29:15.846 --> 02:29:17.281
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOM A

02:29:17.348 --> 02:29:18.916
GENERAL FUND BEYOND WHAT IS.

02:29:18.983 --> 02:29:20.318
IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED OBVIOUSLY

02:29:20.384 --> 02:29:22.253
IT WILL BE A YEAR BY YEAR

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:24.622
ASSESSMENT OF HAVE NEEDS GOING

02:29:24.689 --> 02:29:26.390
FORWARD THIS IS A FINE FAT.

02:29:26.457 --> 02:29:27.391
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:29:27.458 --> 02:29:29.093
LEGISLATUREMONITOR VERY CLOSELY

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:31.629
EVERY YEAR -- BUT AT THIS POINT

02:29:31.696 --> 02:29:33.631
WE HAVE A SOLVENT MOTOR VEHICLE

02:29:33.698 --> 02:29:36.300
COUNT -- GOING.

02:29:36.367 --> 02:29:37.601
FOR IT AND WHAT IS THE ARE

02:29:37.668 --> 02:29:40.404
ARGUMENT FOR UTILIZING REVENUE

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:43.774
BONDS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY.

02:29:43.841 --> 02:29:45.309
BY THE PUBLIC BUILDING

02:29:45.376 --> 02:29:47.311
CONSTRUCTION FUND.

02:29:47.378 --> 02:29:48.879
HAS BEEN USED TO FUNDS --

02:29:48.946 --> 02:29:51.349
CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS FOR MANY

02:29:51.415 --> 02:29:52.783
DIFFERENT ENTITIES IN THE STATE

02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:54.452
THAT THIS PART OF ITS PURPOSE

02:29:54.518 --> 02:29:57.788
THE THE ARGUMENT.

02:29:57.855 --> 02:29:59.323
THAT -- SOME OF THESE PROJECTS

02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:01.158
ARE ALREADY HAD -- THROUGH.

02:30:01.225 --> 02:30:03.594
THERE ARE WORKING DRAWINGS AND

02:30:03.661 --> 02:30:04.261
THEY'RE READY TO GO TO

02:30:04.328 --> 02:30:06.130
CONSTRUCTION -- FUNDING THEM

02:30:06.197 --> 02:30:08.232
WITH THE BILLING CONSTRUCTIN

02:30:08.299 --> 02:30:09.300
FUND WILL NOT ONLY ALLOW THEM TO

02:30:09.367 --> 02:30:10.501
GO FORWARD.

02:30:10.568 --> 02:30:13.204
BUT WELL THERE WILL BE SOME COST

02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:14.305
INCREASES THEY ARE OFFSET BY THE

02:30:14.372 --> 02:30:15.373
FACT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING

02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:16.140
THEM NOW BECAUSE THERE'S OF

02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:17.541
COURSE THE GROWTH.

02:30:17.608 --> 02:30:18.743
ON WHEN YOU DELAY A PROJECT

02:30:18.809 --> 02:30:20.177
CONSTRUCTION COSTS GET GREATER

02:30:20.244 --> 02:30:22.513
AND SO -- OVER SEVERAL YEARS IT

02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:24.515
WOULD IT WOULD NOT OUT WHILE

02:30:24.582 --> 02:30:25.483
STILL ALLOWING THESE PROJECTS GO

02:30:25.549 --> 02:30:26.317
FORWARD.

02:30:26.384 --> 02:30:29.553
BUT IT IS IN A REVENUE BOND AND

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:31.989
THAT COULD BE A GREATER EXPENSE

02:30:32.056 --> 02:30:34.258
THE STATE WOULD NOT.

02:30:34.325 --> 02:30:35.326
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE FOR

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:36.494
THAT THE CONSTRUCTION PROCEEDS

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:37.928
NOW THERE IS IN THE INCREASED

02:30:37.995 --> 02:30:40.431
COST OF DEBT SERVICE.

02:30:40.498 --> 02:30:40.798
BUT BACK.

02:30:40.865 --> 02:30:43.267
ABSOLUTELY 20% BUT IF YOU DELAY

02:30:43.334 --> 02:30:45.369
THAT SAME PROJECT BY FIVE TO

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:46.270
SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:30:46.337 --> 02:30:47.371
TRYING TO FIND IT ON A CASH

02:30:47.438 --> 02:30:50.508
BASIS -- THAT AMOUNT GETS EATEN

02:30:50.574 --> 02:30:52.543
UP BY INFLATED CONSTRUCTION

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:52.743
COSTS.

02:30:52.810 --> 02:31:09.560
OKAY

02:31:11.462 --> 02:31:11.529
.

THERE'S AN ANNUAL THERE HAS BEEN

02:32:39.483 --> 02:32:41.018
SINCE NINE TEN THERE'S BEEN AN

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:42.319
ANNUAL TRANSFERRED IN THE BUDGET

02:32:42.386 --> 02:32:44.188
ACT IT'S BASED ON THE PRIOR YOUR

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:45.389
ACTUAL AMOUNTS THAT WERE

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:47.091
COLLECTED BY DMV.

02:32:47.157 --> 02:32:48.692
AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO SUSPEND

02:32:48.759 --> 02:32:50.427
THAT SO IT WOULDN'T COME.

02:32:50.494 --> 02:32:52.496
AFTER THE FIVE YEARS WELL TAKE A

02:32:52.563 --> 02:32:53.631
LOOK AT IT BUT AT THIS POINT

02:32:53.697 --> 02:32:55.499
IT'S NOT A LOAN A REPAIRMAN IT'S

02:32:55.566 --> 02:32:56.634
A WE ARE NOT GOING TO TRANSFER

02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:58.536
THOSE MONIES OUT OF THE MOTOR

02:32:58.602 --> 02:33:00.638
VEHICLE COUNT INTO.

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:03.974
THE GENERAL FUND. FOR FIVE YEARS.

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:05.075
BUT THAT SPARES.

02:33:05.142 --> 02:33:05.643
ANY DRAW ON THE GENERAL FUND

02:33:05.709 --> 02:33:07.311
CORRECT [inaudible]

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:10.915
BUT THAT GENERAL FUND MONEY IS

02:33:10.981 --> 02:33:13.250
NOT GOING TO BE JUST.

02:33:13.317 --> 02:33:15.352
IT'S GOING TO BE SPENT SOMEWHERE

02:33:15.419 --> 02:33:16.253
ELSE CORRECT.

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:17.321
SO IN TERMS OF OVERALL BUDGET

02:33:17.388 --> 02:33:20.291
IMPACT.

02:33:20.357 --> 02:33:20.891
IT'S NOT BEEN ANY RELIEF FOR

02:33:20.958 --> 02:33:22.259
BENEFIT.

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:24.061
SO WHAT IS THE RATIONALE. FOR

02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:26.163
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:27.331
HOW ARE YOU MAKING IT MORE

02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:29.533
EFFICIENT MORE EFFECTIVE LESS

02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:33.037
COSTLY? SEVEN IN ESSENCE A

02:33:33.103 --> 02:33:34.405
DEFINED SHIFT RATHER EVENT LIKE

02:33:34.471 --> 02:33:36.073
TO POINT YOU'RE SAYING IF WE DID

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:37.942
NOT SUSPEND THE TRANSFER WE

02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:39.476
COULD FIND AT THIS PROPOSAL WITH

02:33:39.543 --> 02:33:41.178
GENERAL FUND ALTERNATIVELY WE

02:33:41.245 --> 02:33:43.447
SUSPEND THE TRANSFER.

02:33:43.514 --> 02:33:45.583
AND WE FIND IT WITHIN VA.

02:33:45.649 --> 02:33:48.018
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

02:33:48.085 --> 02:33:48.519
[inaudible]

02:33:48.586 --> 02:33:50.521
THANK YOU.

02:33:50.588 --> 02:33:52.590
THE SLEEP FROM LA I'LL -- THANK

02:33:52.656 --> 02:33:53.857
YOU VERY MUCH AS A REFERENCE TO

02:33:53.924 --> 02:33:56.327
HER EARLIER -- WE HAVE PREPARED

02:33:56.393 --> 02:33:57.628
SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:33:57.695 --> 02:33:58.662
CONSIDERATION IF YOU TRY TO THE

02:33:58.729 --> 02:33:59.530
HANDOUT THAT WE DISTRIBUTED

02:33:59.597 --> 02:34:01.532
EARLIER WE'RE GONNA START ON

02:34:01.599 --> 02:34:02.933
PAGE SIX OF YOUR HAND OUT.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.835
IN TOTAL WE HAVE SEVEN ISSUES

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:06.804
THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN REALLY

02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:08.839
OUR PERSPECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:10.541
THESE IS TO HOLD THE LEGISLATURE

02:34:10.608 --> 02:34:11.375
THING THROUGH.

02:34:11.442 --> 02:34:13.444
THE THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:15.446
THEM AS WELL THINKING ABOUT ON

02:34:15.512 --> 02:34:16.480
AN ONGOING BASIS WHAT THE

02:34:16.547 --> 02:34:18.382
APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVELS

02:34:18.449 --> 02:34:20.417
SHOULD BE.

02:34:20.484 --> 02:34:21.118
THE FIRST ONE I'LL JUST GO OVER

02:34:21.185 --> 02:34:22.286
REALLY BRIEFLY BECAUSE WE TALKED

02:34:22.353 --> 02:34:23.220
ABOUT IT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:34:23.287 --> 02:34:24.655
CLEAR OUT COMING PERFORMANCE

02:34:24.722 --> 02:34:25.356
MEASURES.

02:34:25.422 --> 02:34:27.358
BEING A TOOL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY

02:34:27.424 --> 02:34:29.259
AND ENSURING THAT LEGISLATIVE

02:34:29.326 --> 02:34:30.828
EXPECTATIONS ARE MET.

02:34:30.894 --> 02:34:32.997
THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THIS

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:34.365
REQUEST IS BASED ON A LOT OF

02:34:34.431 --> 02:34:37.334
ASSUMPTIONS -- FERRIS OPTIONS ON

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:39.870
HOW INDIVIDUALS REACT TO THINGS

02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:42.373
LIKE THE REAL ID -- DEADLINE AS

02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:43.807
WELL AS THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES

02:34:43.874 --> 02:34:45.109
AT THE DMV SEE IN SEEKING TO

02:34:45.175 --> 02:34:46.443
IMPLEMENT WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:48.278
INDIVIDUALS REACT IN THAT COULD

02:34:48.345 --> 02:34:48.946
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT SO FOR

02:34:49.013 --> 02:34:52.016
EXAMPLE. ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT

02:34:52.082 --> 02:34:53.751
WAS MENTIONED IS SOFTWARE TO

02:34:53.817 --> 02:34:55.352
VALIDATE SOME OF THIS

02:34:55.419 --> 02:34:57.655
DOCUMENTATION THAT WE WOULD BE

02:34:57.721 --> 02:34:59.223
PROVIDED FOR INDIVIDUALS GO IN.

02:34:59.289 --> 02:35:00.791
THAT ACTUALLY WRITTEN THAT IS A

02:35:00.858 --> 02:35:02.259
GREAT TOOL IF IT WORKS

02:35:02.326 --> 02:35:03.360
EFFECTIVELY AND AS INTENDED

02:35:03.427 --> 02:35:05.029
HOWEVER IT DOES ALSO REYES KIND

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:06.697
OF PRIVACY CONCERNS IT'S UNCLEAR

02:35:06.764 --> 02:35:08.332
THE EXTENT TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS

02:35:08.399 --> 02:35:09.833
WILL BE COMFORTABLE.

02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:10.868
WITH SHARING THINGS LIKE THEIR

02:35:10.934 --> 02:35:12.069
AND NAME ORSOCIAL SECURITY

02:35:12.136 --> 02:35:14.238
NUMBER DATE OF BIRTH

02:35:14.304 --> 02:35:15.305
ELECTRONICALLY.

02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:16.640
OUR THIRD ISSUE FOR

02:35:16.707 --> 02:35:18.075
CONSIDERATION THE BOTTOM OF THIS

02:35:18.142 --> 02:35:19.777
PAGE IS THAT THE NET IMPACT OF

02:35:19.843 --> 02:35:21.412
ALL OF THE VARIOUS PROPOSED

02:35:21.478 --> 02:35:22.780
ACTIVITIES IS REALLY UNCLEAR.

02:35:22.846 --> 02:35:23.914
SO A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES ARE

02:35:23.981 --> 02:35:25.749
DESIGNED TO SHIFT INDIVIDUALS

02:35:25.816 --> 02:35:27.484
OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICE AND TO

02:35:27.551 --> 02:35:28.352
THE EXTENT THAT SHIFT IS

02:35:28.419 --> 02:35:30.320
APPROPRIATE. FOR A IS

02:35:30.387 --> 02:35:31.488
SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH I SHOULD

02:35:31.555 --> 02:35:33.791
SAY HE WILL THEN HAVE EMPLOYEES

02:35:33.857 --> 02:35:35.225
WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY HANDLING

02:35:35.292 --> 02:35:36.260
THAT WORKLOAD THAT COULD BE

02:35:36.326 --> 02:35:38.028
REDIRECTED TO HANDLE REAL ID

02:35:38.095 --> 02:35:39.930
WORKLOAD.

02:35:39.997 --> 02:35:41.632
INTO THE NET IMPACT IS REALLY

02:35:41.699 --> 02:35:43.267
KIND OF UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT.

02:35:43.333 --> 02:35:44.368
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE.

02:35:44.435 --> 02:35:47.438
SEVEN OUR FOURTH ISSUE IS --

02:35:47.504 --> 02:35:49.440
THIS IS THIS ISSUE ABOUT SHORT

02:35:49.506 --> 02:35:51.975
TERM VERSUS LONG TERM ACTIVITIES

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:53.977
AND SO YOU HAVE THAT OCTOBER

02:35:54.044 --> 02:35:55.512
TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE AND SO.

02:35:55.579 --> 02:35:56.847
IN THINKING ABOUT THE CAPACITY

02:35:56.914 --> 02:35:58.148
OF THE DMV AND THE RESOURCES

02:35:58.215 --> 02:35:59.516
THAT ARE AVAILABLE THE

02:35:59.583 --> 02:36:00.317
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS

02:36:00.384 --> 02:36:02.720
ON THAT -- WE'VE HEARD

02:36:02.786 --> 02:36:03.187
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE

02:36:03.253 --> 02:36:04.354
DEVELOPMENT OF A WORK PLAN FOR

02:36:04.421 --> 02:36:05.889
THE LONG TERM THAT'S ACTUALLY A

02:36:05.956 --> 02:36:07.591
REALLY GOOD THING. TO ENSURE

02:36:07.658 --> 02:36:17.267
THAT THE STATE IS KIND OF MOVING

02:36:17.334 --> 02:36:18.302
FORWARD IN A DELIBERATE EVAN

02:36:18.368 --> 02:36:19.770
COMPREHENSIVE MANNER RATHER THAN

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:20.471
DOING IT PIECEMEAL MANNER

02:36:20.537 --> 02:36:21.171
BECAUSE IF YOU MOVE FORWARD IN A

02:36:21.238 --> 02:36:21.805
PIECEMEAL MANNER YOU MIGHT END

02:36:21.872 --> 02:36:23.841
UP -- USING RESOURCES IN IT AND

02:36:23.907 --> 02:36:25.209
EFFECTIVE MANNER IN THE LONG RUN.

02:36:25.275 --> 02:36:26.043
THE FIFTH ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.710
RAISE YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT ALL

02:36:26.777 --> 02:36:27.311
OF THE VARIOUS PENDING

02:36:27.377 --> 02:36:28.579
EVALUATIONS -- THE PROTOTYPING

02:36:28.645 --> 02:36:30.681
AND THE PILOTS COULD REALLY VAN

02:36:30.748 --> 02:36:33.317
IMPACT THE MIX OVERALL LEVEL OF

02:36:33.383 --> 02:36:34.752
RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED SO AN

02:36:34.818 --> 02:36:36.720
EASY EXAMPLE FOR THAT IS IF THE

02:36:36.787 --> 02:36:38.355
FIELD OFFICE EXPERIENCE OR JUST

02:36:38.422 --> 02:36:39.523
HOW THE FIELD OFFICES ARE

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:41.291
CONSTRUCTED REALLY CHANGES.

02:36:41.358 --> 02:36:43.660
pLEVEL OF RESOURCES AND IT'S

02:36:43.727 --> 02:36:45.162
UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME WHETHER

02:36:45.229 --> 02:36:47.164
WE'D BE REDIRECTING RESOURCES OR

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:48.132
FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WOULD

02:36:48.198 --> 02:36:49.500
BE REQUESTED THROUGH THE

02:36:49.566 --> 02:36:51.168
PROVISIONAL PROCESS.

02:36:51.235 --> 02:36:53.137
THE SIXTH ISSUE TOWARDS THE

02:36:53.203 --> 02:36:54.705
BOTTOM IS THAT.

02:36:54.772 --> 02:36:57.741
THE EXISTING CHALLENGES WITH --

02:36:57.808 --> 02:36:59.476
THE MOVE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IT

02:36:59.543 --> 02:37:01.211
INFRASTRUCTURE AND JUST SIMPLY

02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:03.180
CAPACITY ISSUES YOU HAVE SO MANY

02:37:03.247 --> 02:37:04.882
FIELD OFFICES COULD REALLY

02:37:04.948 --> 02:37:06.650
IMPACT HOW EFFECTIVELY THE

02:37:06.717 --> 02:37:09.086
REQUESTED RESOURCES ARE USED.

02:37:09.153 --> 02:37:10.354
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HEARD

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:11.755
THE AUDIT RAISES THIS ISSUE

02:37:11.822 --> 02:37:13.557
ABOUT INEFFECTIVE -- ALLOCATION

02:37:13.624 --> 02:37:15.492
OF RESOURCES THERE'S A REQUEST

02:37:15.559 --> 02:37:16.493
FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:18.428
PEOPLE AND SO IT TO THE EXTENT

02:37:18.495 --> 02:37:19.930
WE DON'T KIND OF ADDRESS THAT IT

02:37:19.997 --> 02:37:22.332
MAY MEAN THAT WERE NOT USING THE

02:37:22.399 --> 02:37:24.067
REQUESTED RESOURCES IN THE MOST

02:37:24.134 --> 02:37:25.402
EFFECTIVE MANNER.

02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:26.203
TURNING TO THE FINAL PAGE WE

02:37:26.270 --> 02:37:28.272
CANNOT PAGE EIGHT THE LAST ISSUE

02:37:28.338 --> 02:37:30.374
FOR CONSIDERATION IS REALLY

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:31.842
CONSIDERING THE ONGOING LEVEL OF

02:37:31.909 --> 02:37:33.544
OVERSIGHT THAT'S APPROPRIATE

02:37:33.610 --> 02:37:34.745
REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH FUNDING

02:37:34.812 --> 02:37:36.914
IS PROVIDED. TO YOU TALKED A LOT

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:38.348
ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS

02:37:38.415 --> 02:37:40.450
OF ASSUMPTIONS EVALUATIONS

02:37:40.517 --> 02:37:40.918
ETCETERA.

02:37:40.984 --> 02:37:42.486
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

02:37:42.553 --> 02:37:43.921
CONSIDER PROVIDING LIMITED TERM

02:37:43.987 --> 02:37:45.422
FUNDING THIS WOULD REQUIRE DMV

02:37:45.489 --> 02:37:46.924
TO COME BACK AND JUSTIFY HOW THE

02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:48.392
VIEWS THE REQUESTED RESOURCES

02:37:48.458 --> 02:37:49.760
THAT WERE PROVIDED.

02:37:49.827 --> 02:37:52.029
REASSESS THEIR PROCESS SEE IN

02:37:52.095 --> 02:37:53.864
THE MEANTIME AND THEN JUSTIFY

02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:55.432
ANY FUTURE REQUESTS.

02:37:55.499 --> 02:37:57.301
THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

02:37:57.367 --> 02:37:58.302
GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THE MOTOR

02:37:58.368 --> 02:37:59.870
VEHICLE ACCOUNT WHICH WE TALKED

02:37:59.937 --> 02:38:01.939
ABOUT -- BRIEFLY JUST A FEW

02:38:02.005 --> 02:38:03.974
MINUTES AGO.

02:38:04.041 --> 02:38:05.309
A SECOND ISSUE HERE IS.

02:38:05.375 --> 02:38:06.243
THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE DOES

02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:07.711
PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

02:38:07.778 --> 02:38:10.414
FLEXIBILITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:11.048
FINANCE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:38:11.114 --> 02:38:12.382
MOTOR VEHICLES.

02:38:12.449 --> 02:38:13.517
IT WITH ONE OF THE SECTION

02:38:13.584 --> 02:38:15.385
LETTERS BY THE TIME THE

02:38:15.452 --> 02:38:16.220
DEPARTMENT HAD SUBMITTED THE

02:38:16.286 --> 02:38:17.654
REQUEST AND THEY HAVE ACTUALLY

02:38:17.721 --> 02:38:19.256
ALREADY SPENT HALF OF ALMOST

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:21.158
HALF OF THE FUNDING.

02:38:21.225 --> 02:38:21.825
AND IF YOU DO THAT THAT REALLY

02:38:21.892 --> 02:38:23.594
LIMITS JUST LEADERS ABILITY TO

02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:24.995
KIND OF EVALUATE THE CAUSES

02:38:25.062 --> 02:38:26.763
BEHIND THAT AND TAKE ALTERNATIVE

02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:28.699
ACTION IF NECESSARY AND SO ONE

02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:30.267
THING LEGISLATURE CONSIDER IS.

02:38:30.334 --> 02:38:31.702
REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:38:31.768 --> 02:38:33.470
SEEK LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL BEFORE

02:38:33.537 --> 02:38:34.838
INCURRING ANY ADDITIONAL

02:38:34.905 --> 02:38:36.240
EXPENDITURES.

02:38:36.306 --> 02:38:37.341
AND THEN OUR FINAL COMMENT HERE

02:38:37.407 --> 02:38:39.543
IS JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE

02:38:39.610 --> 02:38:41.044

02:44:19.015 --> 02:44:19.583

I WILL TELL YOU IN THE LIGHT OF

02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:21.017
THE REAL ID SITUATION THAT DOES

02:44:21.084 --> 02:44:21.518

WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS THIS DOES

02:44:26.756 --> 02:44:30.260
REQUIRE A PEOPLE -- ENGAGEMENT --

THAT WE ARE BRINGING ON BAR

02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:34.464
REMEMBER THAT MOST OF THOSE ARE

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:35.665
TEMPORARY POSITIONS THAT WE'RE

02:44:35.732 --> 02:44:36.967
BRINGING ON BOARD.

02:44:37.033 --> 02:44:38.101
BUT I FIND INTERESTING THE

02:44:38.168 --> 02:44:39.536
CONVERSATION THE LA BROUGHT UP

02:44:39.603 --> 02:44:41.037

AS FOLKS MAY RETIRE OUT A DMV IT

02:44:54.618 --> 02:44:55.852
KIND OF GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY

02:44:55.919 --> 02:44:57.120
TO BRING IN PEOPLE TO SEE IF

02:44:57.187 --> 02:44:58.455
