THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND- WILL PICK THAT UP AS SOON AS WE HAVE A QUORUM SO THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING. TODAY WE DO HAVE ANOTHER OFFICE SO- SITES BUILT I WILL HAVE ANOTHER ONE. EVEN ON MY APOLOGIES I SHOULD'VE LOOKED AT THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA CENTER OF IT- ITEM NUMBER TWO SB. THIRTEEN OH SEVEN- YOU MAY PRESENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. ONCE AGAIN I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB THIRTEEN OH SEVEN A BILL THAT WILL IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF MOBILE. PARK COMPENSATE MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS THE IDEA FOR THIS BILL ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE TORY NOT MOBILE HOME PARK IN MY DISTRICT. THAT HAD BURNED DOWN AND HOMES AND LIVES WERE DESTROYED. AND I HEARD FROM RESIDENTS WHO WERE DESPERATE FOR HELP. I THAT THEY HAD SEEN BROKEN FIRE HYDRANTS AND I WAS COMMON IN OTHER FACILITIES AND THERE WAS MULTIPLE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS. AND THE SIDE EVERYWHERE AND THEY HAD NO IDEA WHO THAT THEY CAN TURN TO BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT SEEN A CODE ENFORCEMENT. INSPECTOR COME IN AND THEY WOULD CALL HEIR JURISDICTION AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT'S THE CITY. YOU KNOW THAT WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT IS NOT. OUR JURISDICTION SO MEMBERS TODAY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A GAPS BETWEEN INSPECTION VISITS. AND MOBILE HOME PARKS THAT CAN INCREASE THE RISK AND VIOLATIONS. BOB AND COULD CAUSE DEATH OF UNDETECTED AND UNREPORTED. WHICH COULD HAVE FATAL CONSEQUENCES IN A HALF AN AND ONE MOBILE PARK HOME. EXISTING LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA GIVES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MOBILE HOME PARK INSPECTIONS WHILE THE DEPARTMENT DOES THE BEST THAT ACCOUNT IT RESOURCES ARE LIMITED. AND MANY MOBILE HOME PARKS GO YEARS WITHOUT A SINGLE INSPECTION. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RELEASED A REPORT THAT FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD ONLY FORTY SEVEN FIELD INSPECTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY. MOBILE HOME PARKSACROSS THE STATE THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO INSPECT OVER HALF OF THESE PARKS BETWEEN TWENTY TEN. AND TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. THANKFULLY EXISTING LAW DOES CREATE A PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS A MOBILE HOME PARKS. LOCATED IN THEIR JURISDICTION THE PART I'M IS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENT. DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS EXISTS IN FACT THE MOBILE HOME THAT I TOWARD THAT HAD BURNED DOWN WAS WITH THE LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER. THAT HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTS MEMBER FOR NINE YEARS AND HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY CAN TAKE OVER JURISDICTION. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT ONLY ONE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAD REQUESTED THIS INSPECTION. RESPONSIBILITY SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SB THIRTEEN OH SEVEN WILL HELP EDUCATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THE PROCESS INTO SIMPLE WAYS ONE IT WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT. TO CLEARLY POST ABOUT THIS PROCESS ON ITS WEBSITE AND MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. TO IT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO SEND AN ANNUAL NOTICE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXPLAINING THE PURPOSES. THE REASON THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS AS AS A FORMAL LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER MYSELF I KNOW THAT WE HAVE HIGH TURNOVER AND- INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE. IS GONE AND SO BY SENDING THIS NOTICE IT WOULD JUST HELP KEEP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. ARE INFORMED AND REMIND THEM THAT THEY COULD TAKE OVER THIS RESPONSIBILITY. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURED HOME OWNERS SLEEK AND BY SEVERAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS NO OPPOSITION. AND BECAUSE OF SCHEDULE CONFLICTS ARE WITNESS COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY THEY'RE UNAVAILABLE BUT THERE IS THERE IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. BY MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- OKAY WE HAVE NO- REGISTERED LEAD SUPPORT FOR OPPOSITION- SO ALL I ASK IS THERE IS ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF SB THIRTEEN OH SEVEN.

I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ARE PLEASED TO PRESENT S. B. AT TEN NINETY FOUR TODAY THE BILL RUSSO UNINTENDED BARRIERS AND DISADVANTAGES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND ALSO CLARIFY THE CERTAIN TYPES OF HOUSING CAN BE REPORT FOR CREDIT UNDER RINA. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE MEMBERS OUTLINING NOW SYSTEM I THINK THE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR WORKING. WITH ME ON THIS BILL. ROSSER THINKCENTRE ALLEN FIRST PARTNERSHIP HAS EMERGED ARE TWO BILLS INTO ONE. THIS BILL ELIMINATES A REALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE PENALTY THAT COULD HIT. FOR THE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN PLACES THAT HAVE NOT COMPLIED WITH STATE HOUSING LAW. RELATED TO HAVING A ADEQUATE HOUSING ELEMENT. THERE LOT OF PENALTIES ON BOOKS RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD NOT COMPLAIN HOUSING ELEMENTS. THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ON THE HOOK FOR COMPLIANCE RATE OF AN EFFORT A HOUSING DEVELOPER IN THE CITY WITH THE REJECTED HOUSING ELEMENT. PROCEEDS STATE FUNDING. FOR TWO SPECIFIC FUNDING POTS AND THEY WILL GET DISQUALIFIED DO THE CITY'S NONCOMPLIANCE. THIS IS TOTALLY ACCURATE. IT PENALIZES WRONG ACTOR. SB TEN NINETY FOUR MEXICO THE FOR THE HOUSING DEVELOPERS CAN'T BE BARRED. FROM RECEIVING FUNDS FROM THOSE TWO GRANT PROGRAMS NEARLY THE INFILL INFECTION GRANT PROGRAM AND THE FORMER HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. ASCENSION NUMBER CITIES ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING A LOSS THIS IS RESPONSIVE TO AN ISSUE HAPPENING. IN REAL TIME. FOR THE MORE SB TEN NINETY FOUR AUSTRALIA'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE STATE'S NEW PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION LAWS. WHICH PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO LOCALS TO FACILITATE MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CALL. BUT THE INCENTIVES GIVE EXTRA POINTS TO THOSE CITIES DURING THE LIKE PROCESS. FOR THE SAME TO GRANT JUST MENTION. MAKE A SOME OR OF THE GRANTS AVAILABLE TO FOR HOUSING VOTE AS WELL. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP SB TEN NINETY FOUR WILL ADJUST THE PRO HOUSING LAW TO MAKE CLEAR THE SENATE BENEFITS APPLY ONLY TO PROGRAMS WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THE SOLE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. THAT WAY FOR THE HOUSE OF A HOUSING DEVELOPERS SHOULD NOT BE UNFAIRLY DISADVANTAGE WHEN COMPETING FOR THESE GRANTS. THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIES CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL HOUSING TYPES. LIKE SINGLE RESIDENT OCCUPANCY- OR SRO UNITS CAN BE COUNTED IN THE CITY'S ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE RENO. AS WELL AS PERMIT UNITS IN A MOTEL OR HOTEL CONVERSION FOR INSTANCE THOSE INCLUDED IN A HOME K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; YOUR ROOM KEY PROJECT.&lt;/c&gt;</u> THIS IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE WE SEVEN FIVE. AT ME SAID OF ICE PRODUCTION PRODUCTION OF THESE UNITS AND GIVE CREDIT TO CITIES WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT WORK. LASTLY THE BILL BILLS ARE WORK DONE. IN SOME WOMEN GABRIEL'S AB SEVENTY SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR THANK SPENDING THE TYPES OF CONVERTED UNITS. THAT CITY CAN GET CREDIT FOR. IN THE APR. BY ADDING VERY LOW AND LOW COMMUNITIES TO THE TYPES OF INCOME UNITS. THAT CAN UTILIZE AB SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROCESS. AS LONG AS THEY INCREASE THEIR ABOVE MODERATE RINA. ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS. I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE OPPONENTS CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS OF THE AMENDMENTS- I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THEM. AT WHILE WE MOVE FORWARD. WE DID RUN INTO SOME TIME CONSTRAINTS- AGAIN WELL. WELL IT'S TO DRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. I WOULD ME TODAY TESTIFY CAL. SUE THAT RELY OF THE C. OF PACIFICA MIGHT. WHO IS TO THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE CAN. SECULAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR SO WE WILL- WELCOME- US TO BATTLE LOS. GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU IT'S NOT TO BE HERE TODAY I JUST IN FAVOR OF THIS- IN PACIFICA WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY UNITS OF. REGULAR HOUSING THAT WAS JUST PURCHASED FOR A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING- WE NOT ONLY LOSE ALL OF OUR INCOME OUR TAX FROM THAT PROPERTY WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COUNT IT TOWARDS OUR RINA- WE SPECIFICALLY WANTED THIS S. ENTIRELY AFFORDABLE. AND OF SORRY THIS COUNCIL ACTION MADE THEM A 100% AFFORDABLE ALTHOUGH IN THE FIRST YEAR WE LOSE ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT BY YOUR FIFTEEN WE'RE LOSING TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON PROPERTY TAXES. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUE FOR THE CITY OF PACIFICA AND FAR EXCEEDS OUR HOUSING AND LIVE FEEDS- WHICH WE ONLY HAVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THAT FUND. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE WE CAN'T COUNT IT TOWARDS ARENA- WE LOSE IN TWO WAYS IT REMOVES THE INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO PURCHASE. OF BUILDINGS AND TURN THEM INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF WE HAVE A LOSE LOSE FOR THE CITY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR SB TEN NINETY FOUR. IN THE HEARING ROOM SAYING I'M WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR KEY PLEASE QUEUE UP SUPPORT FOR TEN NINETY FOUR. IF YOUR YARD WORK FOR THE NINETY FOUR AT ONE HOUR FIVE. WHEN. EIGHT ZERO. MISTER JERICHO BUT HE IS DOING UP. I'M OKAY ARE WILL NOW GO TO ANY OPPOSITION SB TEN NINETY FOUR- WE HAVE. EXCUSE ME. ON YOUR LAWLER AND BRIAN AUGUSTA LAWLER OR TO SIGN LAWLER MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BOURZAT ALERT SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AS WELL AS FOR MY COLLEAGUES AT THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE DO UNFORTUNATELY STILL HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON THE BILL- AND CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE LANGUAGE EVEN AS IT LEAVES THE COMMITTEE. HOWEVER MUCH APPRECIATE THE TIME WE SPENT WITH CENTER BACK OR TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES HE'S TRYING TO ADDRESS AND HIS COMMUNITIES AND AROUND THE STATE I'M CERTAINLY AGREE THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE CONVERSIONS FOR MARKET RATE TO IT TO LIVE COME WHERE WE CAN- AND CERTAINLY AGREE THAT WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE CITIES TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO CREATE A WIDE RANGE OF HOUSING TYPES TO SERVE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS BUT JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE DO THAT. IN THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WAY THAT DOESN'T. CUT AGAINST OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT HOUSING GOALS SO HAPPY TO HAPPY TO KEEP HAVING A CONVERSATION AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN WORK IT OUT BY THE TIME THE BILL GETS THE ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE. WE GO TO ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. LIGHTNING HAS STRUCK AND WE HAVE A QUORUM. AND SO LET'S ESTABLISH- THE CORN BEFORE WE LOSE. I WAS.

BOEING HOUSE ON THE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE GOING UP OKAY WILL BRING BACK TO THE I'LL CALL ANY CLUE ARE. FEDERER CABALLERO. YEAH I I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I'M IN MY APOLOGIES- I SHOULD JUST READ THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFULLY I THINK- IT IS SENATOR BAKER- THE OPPOSITION RAISES SOME GOOD POINTS AND SO WHAT. WHAT IS WHAT'S YOUR POSITION ON ON- ON ON THE ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED AND WHETHER YOU'RE- INTERESTED IN TRYING TO. TEN AM MEETING AT ARAB YEAH WHICH WHICH PIECES WE ON THE CONVERSE PEACE IN OR IN THE INTERIM IN THE CONNECTION FOR YOU CAN ARMS COMING OUT OF THE BILL OKAY OKAY YET ROUGHLY AROUND THE JUST TO BE CLEAR IN THE COMMITTEE MA'AM AND CINEMA THANKS FOR WITH US. THE PIECE ABOUT HOME SHARING AN INTERIM HOUSING ON IS BEING REMOVED FROM THE BILL OKAY THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE THAT'S YEAH YEAH FOR THE MOTELS AND CALIFORNIA. YES THE THEIR VARIOUS PIECES REMAINING ONE IS- IF- YEAH NOT FOR THE THAT AT CLARIFYING THE SRO. HOUSEBOATS QUALIFY- WHICH WE THINK IS PROBABLY CURRENT LAW BUT IT'S HELPFUL TO CLARIFY IT- IN ADDITION AND- OUR CONVERSION OF MARKET RATE- DEED RESTRICTED. LO LÎNG VERY. LOW INCOME. WHAT I INCREASE TO THE MORE RATE RENA- DOT WILL BE THE MOTTO- CONVERSION PIECE OF THE- AND I WAS A SAID THE THAT. THAT THE CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE OPPOSITE- WE DID BUNCH OF WERE ON THIS I'M SURE- IT GETS TO ASSEMBLY THAT. ASSEMBLY HOW I MANAGE. WE'LL HAVE SOME OPINIONS ON THESE ISSUES AS WELL BY APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION SO I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER CHAIR I GUESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS GET A LITTLE BIT PARANOID ABOUT IS- WEALTHY COMMUNITIES DECIDING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER WAY OF BEING ABLE TO MEET THEIR NUMBERS THAT ARE REALLY FUNNY BALONEY I MEAN I AM NOT SAYING YOU'RE DOING THAT. IT'S JUST- IT'S LIKE WHEN MARIN COUNTY CAME IN AND ASKED FOR AN EXEMPTION FROM THE RENO NUMBERS AND THEY GOT IT IT'S LIKE. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME- WE PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT WHEN COMMUNITIES DON'T BUILD THEIR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY PUSH THEM OUT TO OTHER COMMUNITIES AND THAT PUSH OUT IS CREATING- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EMISSIONS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY- AND IT'S PUSHING. THE DISCUSSION ABOUT BIG MILES TRAVELED AND THE ENTITIES THAT ARE HAVING TO DO THAT SYSTEM HAVE THE DIFF THE WITH IT ARE THERE A RURAL COMMUNITIES. ARE STRUCTURE IN PLACE- THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION SOUGHT. YEAH RESPOND- YEAH I NEED IT UNITS AND THE WE NEED UNITS ALL LEVEL AND MY A MY DISTRICT CERTAINLY AT THE LOW AND VERY LOW- WE ACTUALLY NEED THOSE UNITS- ISSUES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR SUBSIDY FOR ONE UNIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THIS BILL JUST HOW CAN WE INCENTIVIZE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE INCLUSIONARY ZONING THAT'S GONNA GET US PART OF THE WAY THERE BUT- THAT'S MAYBE 1015% AWAY THEIR- AND- WE'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY PAY IT THAT PASSED BIG BEAR HOUSING- FUND. TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OTHER CITIES ARE LOOKING FOR A HUSBAND WE ASK THAT YOU KNOW AND SENT IT AND THIS CONVERSION AND THAT LIKE IN THE CASE OF PACIFICA. THEY DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST THEY JUST DIDN'T GET CREDIT FOR IT FOR THE WEB LAW IS CURRENTLY WORK. BUT THOSE ARE NOW DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS. AND THERE IS A LOT OF KIND OF NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR MIDST IN OUR DISTRICT. THAT WERE VERY WORRIED WE'RE GONNA LOSE. AS YOU KNOW THEM AS THE MARKET KEEPS GOING UP AND UP SOMEBODY EVENTUALLY GOING TO BUY THAT AND YOU KNOW PUT IN. YOUR GRANT OR TOPS IN AND SALAS THE CHARGE YOU KNOW TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE. AND SO WE WANT TO PROTECT THAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND WE THINK WE'VE- WITH THIS BILL WE WERE STRIKING THAT BALANCE HOPEFULLY TO PROTECT THEM. AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY I THINK I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER FOR WORKING WITH US I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE WAY WE WE'VE REVISED THE CONVERSION THAT IF YOU TAKE MARKET WHAT IS MARKET RATE HOUSING NOW AND CONVERTED TO DEED RESTRICTED LOW INCOME VERY LOW INCOME EXTREMELY LOW INCOME INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF THAT BELOW MARKET RATE HOUSING- BUT- IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF ONE OF CANNIBALIZED- IN TERMS OF. THE RENO FOR- IN TERMS OF MARKET RATE. HOUSING WHICH- IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT BUILDING MARKET RATE HOUSING- THEY WERE TELLING THE MIDDLE CLASS TO SCREW OFF- BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS IS NOT GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE. FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING- AND THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE OUR MIDDLE CLASS HOUSING PROBLEM IS TO. DO IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY AN OLD JUST A LOT OF HOUSING. AND SO THE REVISION THE AMENDMENT WILL SAY THAT IF YOU TAKE A FIFTY UNIT COME UP FIFTY UNIT. MARKET RATE APARTMENT BUILDING AND MAKE IT. THE CONVERTIBLE- MARGARITA LOW INCOME THAT'S GREAT I CAN COUNT AGAINST YOUR LOW INCOME- RINA BUT THEN YOUR MARKET RATE RENO WILL GO UP BY FIFTY UNITS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO REPLACE A HOUSING- AND CYPRESS YOU ACCEPTING THAT AMENDMENT- AND WITH THAT- AS AMENDED I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND YOU MAY CLOSE.

THE CHAIR HI AT YOU'RE VERY COMMITTEE STAFF- YOUR- OF THIS BILL IN ALSO PARTNERS. THAT WE'VE- IN IN TRYING TO DRESS- AND IMPORTANT THE END OF ISSUE. I SO AT GENDERS. RESTROOMS HAVE LONG OPPOSED- SOME CONCERN FOR- MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY- AND THIS BILL CAME TO ME FROM WEST HOLLYWOOD WHICH IS A CITY MY DISTRICT. THAT THE JOURNALS WELL- THAT IS BEEN THE HEART OF OUR LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES FOR A LONG TIME. AND CONCERNS CAME UP THROUGH THE CITY THERE ABOUT HOW GENDER NONCONFORMING INDIVIDUALS- FOR THAT GENDER SEGREGATED BATHROOMS OFTENTIMES CAN BE THE SIDE OF VERBAL HARASSMENT PHYSICAL ATTACKS EVEN SEXUAL ASSAULT. ARE AND THE COURSE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND PERSONAL CARE GIVERS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS GENDER SEGREGATED RESTROOMS HOW PLACE MANY. IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION OF NOT USING FACILITIES THAT SORT OF USING FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNED WITH THEIR NEEDS IN MIND AND I'LL GIVE YOU A PERSONAL EXAMPLE I MEAN I'M I'M- MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A LITTLE. LITTLE GUY THREE YEARS OLD. AND- WE GET OFF AN AIRPLANE FOR EXAMPLE AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A FAMILY BATHROOM THAT'S AVAILABLE WE GET OFF THE PLANE SO WE CAN GET IN THERE I CERTAINLY WHEN- WHEN HE WAS BREAST FEEDING WEEK GOT USE THE RESTROOM MAYBE CHANGE A DIAPER WE GO IN TOGETHER AS A COUPLE. ARM AND NOT HAVE TO HAVE ONE PARENT GO AND- AND MAKE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PARENTS. SO ANYWAY I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE SAFE AND INCLUSIVE TO ALL REGARDLESS OF AGE HEALTH CONDITION OR GENDER IDENTITY. OUR THE CHALLENGE WE RUN INTO AND THIS IS WHY THE BILL CAME TO US FROM FROM THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD IS THAT EXISTING STATUTES- LIMIT THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO EXPLORE COMMONSENSE METHODS OF EXPANDING ACCESS AND EFFICIENCY IN THE SPACE SO THIS BILL GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO ORDINANCES OR RESOLUTIONS THAT REQUIRED. CONSTRUCTED ARE SIGNIFICANT RENOVATED PLACES OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION TO HAVE MULTIPLE STYLE PUBLIC RUSSIAN FACILITIES THAT ARE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED WITH SINGLE USER TOILET COMPARTMENTS AND IDENTIFIED FOR USE BY ALL TYPES OF FOLKS ARE FROM DIFFERENT GENDERS. AND SO THIS IS ENTIRELY PERMISSIVE. THIS THE DECISION WOULD BE MADE BY THE CITY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. ARM OUT AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONE OF MY CITIES AS I MENTIONED HAS- HAS COME TO ME TO TAKE TO GET RECTIFIED AS THEIR TIES ARE TRYING TO. WHEN THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CODE. SO I TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY FROM THE CITY WEST HOLLYWOOD WE HAVE THE MAYOR PRO TEM SEPI SHINE AND THEN ALSO COUNCILMEMBER JOHN ERICSSON. OKAY THANK YOU- SO WE'LL HEAR FROM- COUNCILMAN NUMBER ERIKSEN AND FROM MAYOR- SHINE. GOOD MORNING ON A CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SHY AND I AM THE MAYOR PRO TEM OF THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD LAST YEAR AFTER THE CITY COUNCIL MY COLLEAGUE COUNCIL MEMBER JOHN ERIC AND WITH. ALSO LEFT IN NOVEMBER AND I INTRODUCED A MOTION DIRECTING STAFF TO IMPLEMENT MULTI STALL GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS IN WEST HOLLYWOOD. MUCH TO OUR SURPRISE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODES WHICH WEST HOLLYWOOD FOLLOWS IS NOT ALLOW OUR THIRTY THREE CLARITY ADDING A RESTAURANT. THE LESBIAN WOMEN OF COLOR WHO HAS MANY TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NONCONFORMING FRIENDS I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND THOUSAND RESIDENTS AND VISITORS IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME THEY USE THE BATHROOM YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. BILL SIMPLE FACT OF USING A SHAM WHICH BY BUT THE NOT IN ITS WITH TO THINK OF. CAN AND IS A THREAT ON SOME HARMFUL SITUATIONS TRANSGENDERISM NON COME PEOPLE I THINK YOU WILL WITH THAT THAT THIS NOT BE THE CASE IN PROGRESS THE FORWARD THINKING INCLUDES CALIFORNIA. I STATES HAS LED THE NATION IN MANY ISSUES BREAKING DOWN BY FILLING THREE RIPPING OFF AND BRIBING DIVERSITY AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO ARE IT IS MANAGED THE CRIED. VIOLENCE AND TOLERANCE ARE VERY REAL FACT OF LIFE FOR TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NONCONFORMING PEOPLE MAKING RESTROOMS GENDER NEUTRAL IS THE RIGHT STEP FOR OUR CITY AND MANY OTHERS IN THE STATE SB ELEVEN NINETY FOUR WILL GIVE CITIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE TO REQUIRE MULTI FELL GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS IN PLACE OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION THAT ARE NEWLY BUILT WITH THOSE THAT UNDERGO SUBSTANTIAL. REMODELING ALL OF YOU HAVE TAKEN BOTH LEADERS AND A OUR STATE A SHINING. OF INCLUDES THE AND CAUGHT. I URGE TO STILL BE THE AND PASS THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDER.

AS THE MAYOR PRO TEM INDICATED USING THE RESTROOM CAN BE A STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR TRANS AND GENDER NONCONFORMING PEOPLE IT CAN ALSO BE AWKWARD EXPERIENCE FOR DISABLED INDIVIDUALS REQUIRED THE ASSISTANCE OF A CAREGIVER WHO MAY BE OF THE OPPOSITE GENDER THERE SHOULD BE NOT SHOULD THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY AWKWARDNESS ABOUT USING THE RESTAURANT ANYWHERE. CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION MANY TIMES BEFORE AND SHOULD LEAD A MULTI STALL GENDER NEUTRAL RESTROOMS THROUGH AT ELEVEN NINETY FOUR IT'S GOOD FOR ALL COMMUNITIES THAT RECOGNIZE THE THIRD I PERSONALLY AND PROVIDE THE STATE'S RATES FOR ALL SB NINE ELEVEN NINETY FOUR ALSO RESPECT FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL BY ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO OPT IN INTO THESE NEW REGULATIONS. BY ADOPTING AN ORDINANCE FURTHERMORE THE BILL AFFORD COMMUNITIES THE DISCRETION TO DEFINE THE LEFT THE PROJECT THAT WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OR EXEMPTED FROM THEM.

I THANK YOU VICE CHAIR- SENATOR I WANTED PRECIADO YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BEFORE ST CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD- I. WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS THE NUMBER OF THE BILL. I ALSO WANTED TO PRESHEAF STAFF IN THE ANALYSIS THEY MADE SOME OTHER POINTS THAT THE TESTIMONY SO FAR HAS BEEN SPOT ON ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS FOR OUR- TRANSGENDER FOLKS AND OUR NON CONFORMING FOLKS HOWEVER. WHAT WE ALSO KNOW AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS POINTING IT OUT THAT OUR PRACTICE OF PRIMARILY HAVING YOU KNOW JUST AND IN MAN'S BATHROOM OR WOMEN'S BATHROOM. IS LED TO MOST OF US WOMEN WHO GO TO ANY KIND OF PUBLIC EVENT WAIT A LONG TIME HIS FOR THAT'S TRUE. AND SO WE YOU KNOW AND- IT IT'S WE'VE UNDERSTOOD NOW THAT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO IF ONE RESTROOM IS EMPTY LET'S USE. IT RIGHT AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE. YOUR MANY PEOPLE ARE. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES NON CONFORMING. THEIR THEIR APPEARANCE THEIR PRESENTATION MAY NOT MEET YOUR MY EXPECTATION OF A PARTICULAR SEX- WERE YEAH I ALWAYS GET MIXED UP WITH R. C. GENDER THEIR SEX BUT IF I'M POLICIES THAT I AM NOT. GETTING THAT TERMINOLOGY RIGHT BUT IN OTHER WORDS. YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE AS A MALE BUT YOUR APPEARANCE DOES NOT PRESENT TO SOMEBODY ELSE SOMEBODY ELSE DOESN'T ASSUME. YOUR MAIL SO YOU MAY NOT VIEW YOURSELF AS NON CONFORMING AND THIS OF COURSE WHEN WE HAVE. KIDS OFTEN FACE THIS END DATE I REMEMBER MY DAUGHTER'S FRIENDS OFTEN EXPERIENCING WHERE THEY WENT INTO A RESTROOM AND WE'RE TOLD LIKE WHAT ARE YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS RESTROOM. YOU SHOULDN'T BE AND THEN THEY WOULD BE LIKE WHAT YOU KNOW IT SO IT'S THIS- WE ALL HAVE THESE WE PROJECT ON TO PEOPLE. THE IT WILL IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PERSON SO WHY WE HAVE THIS ARBITRARY DISTINCTION. IN OUR BUILDING CODE REALLY DOESN'T SERVE ANY OF US AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THE- COMMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE THAT BROUGHT INTO THE BENEFITS OF THE BILL. BEYOND WHAT THE KEY THINGS THAT REALLY WE KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR TRANSGENDER AND NONCONFORMING FOLKS. AND- I WILL MOVE THE BILL SENATOR CARILLO. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I JUST WANNA- GO ON RECORD I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT I GENERALLY DON'T SUPPORT JUMPING IN FRONT OF OUR- PROCESSES THAT WE GO THROUGH THROUGH THE- BUILDING AND STANDARDS CODE- HAVING SAT ON THAT COMMITTEE I. I AM. I AM PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE NEED FOR- THAT DEPARTMENTS TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY SHOULD DO THROUGH THE APA- HEARINGS AND COMMENTS AND- IT'S A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE PROCESS AND THEN THE COMMISSION- IT GOES THROUGH THE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PROCESS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO MOVE THIS HAPPENED TO DO IT QUICKLY BUT I WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T TAKE AWAY. FROM OUR PROCESS SEES- THE ABILITY TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AT THE BUILDING STANDARDS CODES AND IN THE DEPARTMENTS AS WELL SO THREE POINT I WILL I WILL SUPPORT IT THANK YOU WE STARTED DOING IT WE'D END UP WITH A MASS LIKE I THINK.

WITH GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR ALAN AND SIGHED DO WE HAVE A MOTION MOVED BY CITIZENS CORRECT OKAY GREAT- WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY FOUR BY SENATOR ALAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS SENATOR WIENER AYE INTER AYE BATES. BATES HI CABALLERO RIGHT CABALLERO HI CORTESE MCGUIRE MITCHELL BROKE. SKINNER SKINNER HI I'M BURKE HI NUMBER FIVE ACCOUNTS KEEP MY CASKEY I SIX ZERO THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'LL PUT THAT ON HOLD THANK YOU- OKAY OUR FINAL BILL THE DAY IS ITEM TEN SP TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR BY CENTER BATES SURVEY TO MAKE- PRESENTS. RIGHT. THANK WITH. WELL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- GOOD MORNING AND I AM PLEASED OUT TODAY 2% SB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WILL WORK TO ALLEVIATE THE HOMELESS CRISIS BY CREATING ADDITIONAL PATHWAYS OF AID FOR THE HOMELESS I'M CALLING IT THE HOMELESS FIRST PLUS POLICY WHCH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO ALLOW A LITTLE BROADER INTERPRETATION OF THE OUR HOUSING POLICY FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN DIEGO THERE'S NOT A COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS GONE UNTOUCHED BY THE HOMELESS CRISIS SWEEPING THE STATE. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS ALLEVIATION INITIATIVES THROUGH FIFTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ACROSS FIFTEEN STATE ENTITIES WHY WE HAVE BROUGHT OVERWHELMING FINANCIAL FIRE POWER TO THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM HAS GROWN TO NIGHT OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WILL SLEEP IN THEIR CARS CANCER OUTSIDE SIMPLY PUT THIS IS JUST NOT RIGHT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS HAS REACHED SUCH A MAGNITUDE AND THE SOLUTIONS WE HAVE TRIED HAVE FAILED AT SUCH A SCALE WE NEED AND ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPE APPROACH TO OFFER FRESH ALTERNATIVES. AS YOU ALL KNOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA ADOPTED THE HOUSING FIRST ONLY MODEL FOR ALL PROJECTS WITH STATE FUNDING WHILE I BELIEVE THERE ARE CERTAINLY MANY CASES WERE HOUSING FIRST IS THE NECESSARY AND BENEFICIAL PROGRAM HOWEVER PRIORITIZING AS THE SINGLE SOLUTION PERMANENT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THAT WON'T BE USABLE UNTIL THE NEXT STEP DECADE AT THE EXPENSE OF CREATING AN OPERATING IN ASSISTING SHELTERS AND NON PROFITS WHO INCLUDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT CAN BRING SPRING INTO ACTION TODAY IS THE WAY TO GO. SIX ALLEGE HAS RIGIDLY CLUNG TO HOUSING FIRST ONLY WITHOUT PROVIDING THE SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS. JUST THIS YEAR OUR COLLEAGUE IN THE OTHER HOUSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARLOS VIA. WE DO OUR ROUTE FORTY BUILT WITH THE SMALLEST OF CARVE OUTS TO HOUSING FIRST ONLY THE BILL WOULD HAVE PROOF PROHIBITED ALCOHOL AND DRUG USE. IN A DESIGNATED HOUSING ONLY FOR SO SHELTER FACILITY WHERE CHILDREN ARE PRESENT IN THE TENET IS UNDER A COURT ORDER TO REFRAIN FROM USE OF THOSE SUBSTANCES AS A CONDITION OF REUNIFICATION WITH THEIR CHILDREN. THE BILL COULD NOT EVEN GET A HEARING DATE SET BECAUSE IT PROVIDED AN EXCEPTIONTO THE HOUSING FIRST REQUIREMENT. AND IGNORED THE NEED FOR A SAFE AND SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR OTHER PEOPLE PARENTS AND CHILDREN WHO ARE CO LOCATED WITH SOMEONE ENGAGED IN DRUG OR ALCOHOL MISUSE. FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA FROM DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE THIS ALL IN APPROACH TO HOUSING FIRST AND HOUSING FIRST ONLY SUBJECTS SUBJECTS THEM TO ADDITIONAL ADVERSE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR AND CERTAINLY ARE NONE OF US NEED TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. FOR EXAMPLE OUR RIGID APPLICATION OF HOUSING FIRST POLICY SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECTING CHILDREN TO MORE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES WHEN WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AREAS. WE NEED TO BE OFFERING MORE OPTIONS NOT FEWER. CALIFORNIA'S FORTY MILLION PEOPLE ARE DIVERSE CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN ARE DIVERSE AND CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS POPULATION IS EQUALLY DIVERSE WE MUST PROVIDE. A PALETTE OF OPTIONS RATHER THAN FORCE THE SAME. OUR SOLUTIONS ON EVERY PERSON PROGRAMS AND SHELTERS THAT REQUIRE PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMMING. AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED FROM AND ALL OF THE ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPE APPROACH. AS A FORMER SOCIAL WORKER MYSELF I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE KNOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND WE TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE OR SOME PEOPLE ONLY NEED A PLACE TO STAY AT NIGHT. OTHERS NEED AND WANT ACCOUNTABILITY THE STATE'S CURRENT APPROACH CONSTRAINS THE OPTIONS AND OFFERS THAT THOSE PEOPLE CAN GET. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT ALL OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTIONS HAVE FAILED. BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY SENATOR UMBERG. PASSED SB FOUR FIFTY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THAT BILL EXEMPTED MOTELS HOTELS AND HOSTELS FROM SYKORA IF THE PROJECT CREATED SUPPORTIVE OR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. SB FOUR FIFTY HELP TO ACCELERATE SHELTER CONSTRUCTION CUT RED TAPE AND GOT CALIFORNIANS OFF THE STREETS. UNFORTUNATELY THAT% EXEMPTION RUNS OUT AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SB TWELVE R. EIGHTY FOUR WOULD REMOVE BARRIERS FOR PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT CONFORM TO HOUSING FIRST REGULATIONS. AND ALLOW THEM TO APPLY FOR STATE FUNDING AND IT WOULD ALSO EXTEND THE SECRETIVE SECRET EXEMPTION FOR SUPPORTIVE AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN PLAN AND IMPLEMENT SHELTERS WITH CONFIDENCE. TODAY I AM PLEASED HAVING SHOW STEVE AS A WITNESS FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS SHE RAN ST JOHN'S PROGRAM FOR REAL CHANGE IN SACRAMENTO. AND TRANSFORMED AN ORDINARY THIRTY DAY EMERGENCY SHELTER INTO A ROBUST COMPREHENSIVE EIGHTEEN MONTH PROGRAM HELPING HOMELESS WOMEN AND CHILDREN. SHE HAS ALSO DONE RESEARCH INTO THE EFFECTIVENESS ONLY OUR PROGRAM SHE WILL BE ABLE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE IN SPEAK TO WHY A BROADER APPROACH TO PROVIDE. GREATER SERVICE ACCESS GREATER ACCESS TO SERVICES IS NEEDED AND VERY HUMANE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND CENTER ON WILL YOU BE- ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN COMMON TWELVE INCOMING FOURTEEN.

YES THEY DID GERMANY YOUR SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME VOTE FOR THE FIRST ONE ZERO AT. THEY CURRENTLY HAVE BOTH PARTIES FEEL GROWTH. OKAY COM WE WILL NOW GO TO OPPOSITION WE HAVE TO THE OPPONENT- TO THE OPPONENTS SHARON REPORT AND ZACHARY- WARM UP- AND THIS REPORT IS HERE I THINK- SORRY WHAT WAS ON THE PHONE. THIS REPORT GOOD MORNING SHARON REPORT ON BEHALF OF THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND HOUSING CALIFORNIA A WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE CHANGES TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING FIRST LAW THAT WOULD BE MPOSED AND SB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR. UNDER S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING FIRST LAWS WOULD BE NULLIFIED. UNDER THIS BILL A GOOD PROGRAM FUNDED NOW COULD LOSE FUTURE FUNDING TO A LESS EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. UNDER THIS BILL SOMEONE LIVING IN STATE FUNDED HOUSING COULD BE EVICTED TO HOMELESSNESS IF THEY RELAPSE EVEN THOUGH EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT RELAPSE IS A VERY NORMAL PART OF RECOVERY. WITHOUT A LEASE PEOPLE WOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT PROTECTIONS REFLECTION AFFORDED BY OUR CALIFORNIA LAWS IN MANY OF THE HOUSING PROGRAMS HOUSING UNTIL THEY ACHIEVE SOBRIETY EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW PEOPLE CANNOT GET SOBER WHILE STILL HOMELESS. THEY COULD BE DENIED HOUSING BECAUSE THE STATE FUNDED HOUSING PROGRAM BELIEVES THEY AREN'T READY OR THEY HAVEN'T STAYED LONG ENOUGH AND SHELTER. UNDER THIS BILL A CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN STATE FUNDED HOUSING COULD RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS AFTER SIX MONTHS BECAUSE THE PROGRAM ONLY LASTS SIX MONTHS. THE STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT POLICIES WITH DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND LOCALS WOULD HAVE TO NAVIGATE AND EVEN MORE SILENT STATE RESPONSE. BEFORE THE STATE ADOPTED THE HOUSING FIRST LOSS STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS RETURN PEOPLE HOME UP TO HOMELESSNESS FREQUENTLY USING TAXPAYER MONEY FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. REPUBLICAN ANDDEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS IN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND NATIONALLY HAVE ADOPTED HOUSING FIRST AS THE ONLY APPROACH FOR ONE REASON IT WORKS IT IS THE ONLY MODEL THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. AND IT IS THE ONLY MODEL PROVEN TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM RETURNING TO HOMELESSNESS IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE MODEL. AS WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE THE PASSAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF S. B. FOOD THIRTEEN EIGHTY HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN INCREASING THANKS TWO HUNDRED AND 16% INCREASE AND RENTS IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. HOWEVER LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE HOPING MORE CALIFORNIANS EXIT HOMELESSNESS PERMANENTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THIS LAW. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE ON M. S. B.

IN OPPOSITION OKAY SAY NINE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES. THESE JANICE YOU ARE NOT POSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO IN OPPOSITION. AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO PARTY THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES CABALLERO. I JUST HAD A QUESTION AND I APOLOGIZE THEY CAME IN LATE I'M TRYING TO MANAGE THREE COMMITTEES THIS MORNING SPOKE ABOUT THE SAME TIME SORRY- IF IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID I APOLOGIZE- I HAD A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO YOU I HAVE. THIS DIAGRAM IN WHICH IT- EXPLAINS SOME OF THE- CHALLENGES THAT THE HOUSING FIRST HAD AND HOW IT'S BACKFIRED BUT I'M KIND OF CURIOUS BECAUSE- MY ANDERSON THIS CAME FROM HYDE BUT WE HAD A- LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS SAYING HERE THAT IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE SO I WANNA UNDERSTAND THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE BY THE LEAD OPPOSITION AND THE- AND THE HIDE GRAPH. THAT WE HAVE. MAY I IN FACT THAT WAS THE LEAD OPPOSITION YES THERE WAS ONE OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION- MAKING STATEMENTS TO THE FACT THAT HOUSING FIRST HAD BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE OKAY THAT WAS IN THIS REPORT THIS REPORT SO MISTER BRIDGEMAN RESPONDS CENTER CHOI BOGUE. YES I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BEFORE SO- I THINK IN GENERAL I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY. THE TITLE OF IT BUT GENERALLY- NATIONALLY- WE HAVE ADOPTED HOUSING FIRST AS THE FEDERAL POLICY- FEDERAL HOMELESS RESPONSE- AND HOMELESSNESS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIME THAT THAT HAPPENS AND NOW IS THE INCREASE BY AT LEAST 10% OF THANK YOU. AND SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE GRAPH. IS SHOWING WITHOUT LOOKING AT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY DECREASED HOMELESSNESS. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HOMELESSNESS HAS INCREASED IN CALIFORNIA- DESPITE ADOPTION OF HOUSING FIRST BUT THAT WAS WE WERE ON THAT TRAJECTORY ARE READY BEFORE. HOUSING FIRST WAS ADOPTED- IT'S ONLY BEEN IMPLEMENTED SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN SO- I THINK THE ONLY REASON WHY FEDERAL HOMELESSNESS IS INCREASING IS ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OUR HOUSING COSTS ARE SO HIGH SO I'M THE GRAPHIC SHE HAS BOTH THE FEDERAL AS A FEDERAL GRAPH HERE AND IT ALSO HAS A CALIFORNIA SO I'M JUST GONNA USE IN THE CALIFORNIA PART OF IT. NOT AS MUCH- I MEAN WE SHOULD. ACTUALLY NOW WE'RE REFERENCING CALIFORNIA SO I AM MOSTLY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- YOUR- YOUR VERSION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM AND HIDES INTERPRETATION. OF THE- WHAT THEY EXPRESS ARE AND I'M QUOTING THE- JUST REFERENCING THIS DIAGRAM THE ADDAMS. THE FAILED EXPERIMENT AND- AND SECOND TO THAT I'M I'M ALSO KIND OF CURIOUS TO UNDERSTAND- THE END OF THE PROGRAM IS ONLY BE INSTITUTED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN IN YOUR EXPERIENCE- IN THIS SPACE HOW LONG SHOULD WE- LOOK TO THE PROGRAM TO SEE OR TO JUSTIFY ITS SUCCESS OR FAILURE. ON ON THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM- WELL THOSE ARE EXCELLENT QUESTIONS I THINK THAT AGAIN NATIONALLY HOMELESSNESS HAS DECREASED SINCE IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING FOR SO AGAIN I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT BEFORE- BUT IT HAS DECREASED IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOMELESS NUMBERS. WHEN IT WAS ADOPTED INTO A IN TWO THOUSAND SIX OR SEVEN NATIONALLY HOMELESSNESS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY GONE DOWN- OVER THOSE YEARS CALIFORNIA I CANNOT ALREADY MA'AM I WANT TO FOCUS IN CALIFORNIA- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A WITNESS ON THE PHONE- ONLINE THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE. THE ABILITY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AS WELL. IF IT THROUGH THE JACK THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE HEALTH. YES YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN. ASK A QUESTION A MISDEED- MISTY DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. HE WOULD LIKE ME TO ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA ART THE FIFTEEN. SHE'S A SHE'S ASKING ABOUT GRAPHICS THAT HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED OUT I'M A I WILL HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THESE ARE GRAPHICS AFTERWARDS THAT SOME OPINIONS ABOUT THESE GRAPHICS BUT- THE I THINK OUR CENTER CHAU BOGUS ASK YOU TO COMMENT. ON THOSE GRAPHICS. YES THAT THAT THE GRAPH BOTH CHAU PRE CODED HI A HARD DATA IN YOUR HOME WITH THIS IS THAT REPORT. IT IS A COMBINATION OF FIVE THAT'S A HARD DATA USUALLY WHEN WE SEE A HARD DATA IT IS ONE WORK USE THAT. ASSISTANCE HI DAVID THIS IS THE FIFTH REVENUE QUESTION ABOUT THE FATE AT THE QUESTION IS THE DIRECTED TO HAS. THE REASON WE USE CREEK PROBATE IS SO. THE THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY THAT COULD REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THIS OF THREE COKE ED AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT THE FEDERAL. I INCREASE HOMELESS AS BUT MY AND FEAR. AND INCREASED HOMELESS. UNDER WITH IN. HOUSE FIRST THANK YOU. SIXTEEN BUT THEN ADDED IN THAT YOU FOUND. THIS ONE TWO THOUSAND. THERE WAS A FORTY SEVEN POINT 1% INCREASE ON THE AND SHELTER. OF THIRTY THREE POINT 8% INCREASE. IN THE OVERALL HOMELESS POPULATION AGAIN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. EVEN THOUGH- WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TERMINATE PORT OF HOUSING UNITS DEDICATED TO THE HOMELESS I THIRTY THREE PERCENT. FOR ANYONE TO SAY THAT HOMELESSNESS IS GONE DOWN IN CALIFORNIA THE END OR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY NEED TO LOOK AT THE START IT IS HI DAY THAT. YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL HIGH DATA- THAT YOU CAN DOES. NO QUESTION HAD ABOUT- OKAY THANK YOU VERIFY COULD. LOOK AT THE- TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE. YEAH YOU HAVE TO DO ON I'M GONNA BE ADDRESSING AS WELL- IF YOU WANT TO SIGN BRIEFLY I WAS JUST GOING TO MENTION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE SPEAKER WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW HOMELESSNESS IS INCREASE THAT THE LEGISLATION DIDN'T ACTUALLY BECOME EFFECTIVE UNTIL JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND WASN'T ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN IT GAVE TO AGENCIES TWO YEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR OUR FIND THAT. JUST REALLY QUICK SENATOR- WIENER WITH ALL DUE RESPECT NAY MAKE A MOTION I THEY'RE CLOSING MY OTHER COMMITTEE YEAH SO I JUST WANNA MAKE THE MOTION BEFORE YOU LEAVE IS THAT OKAY OKAY ARE YOU GONNA BE BACK TO VOTE I WILL BE BACK TO VOTE THEY'RE JUST OUT THERE AT THE VERY VERY THEY'RE JUMPING FROM HER SHE MADE A MOTION AND- I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. I ANY OTHER OR- CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL I WANNA- THANK MICHELLE STEEP FOR- HER. WORK IN THIS AREA- I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH SAINT JOHN AND- THE WORK THAT THEY DO AND- IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THEY DO BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THEY TAKING WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN OFF THE STREETS BUT- THEIR- TEACHING THEM A TRADE AND- THAT'S REALLY PART OF THIS SOLUTION FOR HOMELESSNESS IS TO BE ABLE TO GET. A JOB AND- SUPPORT YOURSELF AND MOVE INTO YOUR TO HOUSING- ON YOUR OWN- AWAY FROM THE FACILITY SO I THINK SHE DOES REALLY TREMENDOUS WORK AND I KNOW THAT.THE CHALLENGE WITH THE ORGANIZATION IS THAT- AND THEY THEY THEY- ONE OF THE JOB- SKILLS IS THAT WORKING IN THE- IN THE CHECK BE IN THE- FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY AND SO THEY THEY RUN A KITCHEN AND- AND THEY HAVE FUND RAISERS FOR THE WOMEN ACTUALLY WORK AND- AND- SHOW YOU THEIR SKILLS IT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE- SO IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HEAR FROM HER- THE- THE CHALLENGES THEY CAN ACCESS ANY STATE RESOURCES BECAUSE- OF THAT HOUSING FIRST AND THEY HAVE A- REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THEY HOUSE CHILDREN IN THEIR FACILITY THEY HAVE REQUIREMENTS THAT. NO DRUGS OR ALCOHOL- IN THE PROGRAM AND THEY DO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION- A RELAPSE RELAPSING BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE- PART OF THE TREATMENT IS UNDERSTANDING THAT RELAPSES OCCUR AND SO- I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING- OTHER THAN HOST HOUSING FIRST- I'M NOT SURE THIS IS. THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT WHICH IS TO- ELIMINATED AS AS THE PRIMARY PROGRAMS- BUT I BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE SOME PROGRAMS THAT- THAT IF WE LOOKED AT THEM THROUGH THE LENS OF SUCCESS WE'D BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THAT THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL AND- AND THAT THEY ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REACH WHICH IS TO GET PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING- SO. I AM I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL HERE TODAY THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN- BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD SUPPORT A CARVE OUT OF THE PROGRAM FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT THAT CAN PROVE THAT THEIR- EVIDENCE BASED IN THAT THERE'S THAT- A SUCCESS RATE DOWN THAT. THAT DOWN THE ROAD I'M I'M FRUSTRATED WITH SOME OF OUR HOUSING- ARE HOMELESS- PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A REAL GOOD ANALYSIS OF HOW LONG PEOPLE ARE. ARE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS AND WHETHER THEY END UP FALLING BACK BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T PROVIDED THE SKILLS OR THAT- THE PROGRAMMING NECESSARY DID TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL BE BACK ON ON THE STREETS WITHIN- A REAL SHORT PERIOD OF TIME- I. SO AND SO. I WISH YOU WOULD TAKE THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BECAUSE I ALSO LIKE SEE WHAT- EXEMPTION OR THEY SEE QUICK EXTENSION- BUT HAVING SAID THAT I. AM THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I YOU CENTER SKINNER. I'M THANK YOU- CHEER AND- I WANTED SOME OF THE COMMENTS SENATOR KABIR MADE. THAT YOU KNOW THE IT MAY BE VERY IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS WHETHER IT'S TO HOUSING FIRST OR ANOTHER OF OUR POLICIES GIVEN THAT WE HAVE. WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO WE'VE ALREADY BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS- THE PROBLEMS OF HOMELESSNESS. AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO AND OF COURSE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MONEY IS BEING SPENT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO REALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. BUT I THINK IT'S MORE COMPLICATED. THAN THAN THIS BILL. PRESENTS IN TERMS OF THE SOLUTION. AND AND- AT I GUESS WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT AND I KNOW THAT OUR AND CHEER HAS A GREAT INTEREST IN THIS THAT WE AT SOME POINT WHEN WE'RE NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF TRIED TO DO BILLS THAT WE PERHAPS HAVE AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING SO WE CAN BEGIN TO FLASH SOME OF THESE THINGS SOUND IF THERE'S APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE AND IT MAY NOT BE TO HOUSING FIRST MAYBE TO ANOTHER ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS WITH THAT WE PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THIS. BUT ANYWAY- I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE ANSWER AND I APPRECIATED THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS AND THEIR SUGGESTIONS BUT AGAIN AS- THE IT'S THE BILL WOULD BE AS IT IS I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT NO OTHER- MIKE'S RAISED- SO I CENTER BATES APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR FOLKS YOUR PERSISTENCE AND FISHER THANK YOU HAD A BILL A FEW YEARS AGO AS WELL AND WHEN I WAS CHAIRING THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE- WITHOUT THE AMENDMENT AS- AS YOU AND I DISCUSSED I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL. IF THIS WERE LIMITED TO THIS EXTENSION OF THE SEQUEL EXAM EXAMS I WOULD ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT I- BUT THE ELIMINATION OF HOUSING FIRST AS A CRITIC AS A NO CORNERSTONE. OF OUR HOUSING POLICY IS JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT I CAN- SUPPORT- I DO NOT REALLY TAKE ISSUE WITH THIS GRAPHIC THAT WE BEEN DISTRIBUTED THIS IS- I THINK THAT'S TO BE BLIND  THINK IT'S MISLEADING- THAT IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF- CORRELATION VERSUS. CAUSATION TO THE SICK I DON'T KNOW JUST BECAUSE HOUSING FIRST WAS ADOPTED IN CERTAIN YEAR EVEN THOSE YOU KNOW WASN'T EVEN IMPLEMENTED A FEW YEARS LATER. AND HOMES IS GOING UP THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HOUSING FIRST BECAUSE HOMELESSNESS TO GO OUT- I THERE'S NO INDICATION THE HOUSING FIRST BECAUSE HOMELESSNESS- TO GO UP HOUSING FIRST PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM BECOMING A RELAXING ON THE HOMELESSNESS OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS IS THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES. ON TO FALL FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND OUR NEEDED HEALTH STOCK- WE RANK FORTY NINE OUT OF FIFTY STATES AND HOMES FOR CAPITAL WE'RE SHORT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND A HALF AND THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOMES WERE PRODUCING EACH YEAR APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE HOMES THAT WE NEED TO BE PRODUCING. EVERY YEAR COMMUNITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO OBSTRUCT THE CREATION OF NEW HOUSING CONTINUE TO VIOLATE STATE LAW BRAZENLY. CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR LOOPHOLES. OUR CONTINUE TO DO THINGS. LIKE- PROCLAIM THEIR CITY BE I'M MALE AND LION HABITAT WORD A PRICKLY THEIR ENTIRE C. TO BE RISE TO. DISTRICT OR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF SHENANIGANS THAT CITIES ARE USING. TO AVOID- CREATING HOUSING- THAT'S WHY HOMELESS NUMBERS RE GOING UP BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING PERIOD FIRST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH HOUSING AT EVERY INCOME LEVEL- AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND- DECIDE IF WE REALLY ARE COMMITTED. TO PRIORITIZING. THE BASIC CONCEPT THAT WISH THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A HOME- I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST SAINT JOHN I'VE ONLY HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE- AND SAINT JOHN CAN CONTINUE WITH THAT SMALL HOUSING WE DON'T BAN. ORGANIZATIONS FROM HAVING WE OR DON'T WE DON'T MANDATE THAT ALL HOUSING- FOR ALL NONPROFITS HAVE TO BE HOUSING FIRST. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET STATE FUNDING YOU HAVE TO BE AND YOU CAN'T TAKE SOMEONE OUT ON THE STREET BECAUSE THE RELAPSE. THAT'S CALIFORNIA HOUSING POLICY. BECAUSE PEOPLE DO RELAPSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO RELAPSE BUT IF THEY DO. THEY SHOULD HAVE BECOME HOMELESS AS A RESULT THAT DOESN'T BENEFIT ANYONE. IT MAKES IT HARDER TO RE HOUSE- IT INCREASES TAXPAYER COSTS. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH- SO UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT- THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE REQUESTED- I WILL BE OPPOSING- THE BILL TODAY- AND- SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE DISCUSSION AND CERTAINLY IT DEBATING OF. THE STATISTICS THAT SHOW UP ON. A FARM. AS AS WE HAVE HERE THE FOB JUST AUTOMATICALLY SAY THAT THAT IS CAUSE AND EFFECT AND I DIDN'T MEAN IT TO BE INCLUDED BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOWS THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS AND WITH THE HOMELESS ENOUGH FIRST UP PLUS POLICY I THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE VERY TRAGIC THINGS THAT HAPPENED ENOUGH FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND HAVE RESIDENTS THAT ARE. ARE SPECIFICALLY- WITH ISSUES AYE AYE I'D LIKE TO REFER TO AN ARTICLE THAT APPEARED RECENTLY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE I BELIEVE WE'RE- IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO ALONE MORE THAN TEN PEOPLE A MONTH THAT WERE IN CITY SUPPORTING HOUSING FACILITIES AND SHELTER IN PLACE. HOTELS AND THESE ARE HOUSING FIRST POLICY FACILITIES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DIED OF DRUG OVERDOSES BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE SUPPORTIVE. ARM I'D LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL IN THE APPROACH I'M TAKING HERE IS NOT TO ELIMINATE HOUSING FIRST AYE. I THINK THERE'S WAYS TO SET A FINANCIAL- COMPONENT INTO A BILL LIKE THIS THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT A PILOT PROJECT- HOUSING FIRST PLUS FACILITIES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TAX DOLLARS AND HOUSING FIRST ONLY. ARE THERE- THEIR FINANCIAL GRANTS WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED THOSE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE LOOKED OUT AND I WOULD HOPE I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT GOING FORWARD IF I DON'T HAVE THE VOTES WE COULD. WE COULD BE ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE IT IS CLEARLY NOT AN ATTEMPT TO YEAH. S. FIRST POLICY AS A PLEASURE- I ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN THAT BEFORE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A STATE POLICY BECAUSE I- THERE WAS ONE OF THE DIRECTORS SOB. IN THE GENERAL RELIEF PROGRAM AS IT WAS CALLED WE WERE FREQUENTLY GIVING HOUSING VOUCHERS TO PUT PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND HAD ALCOHOLIC DICTION IN INTO SINGLE. OUR RESIDENTS ONLY FACILITIES AND DOWN REFERRING THEM TO A VARIETY OF. COMMUNITY ARE BASED- TREATMENT FACILITIES AND MANY OF THOSE THEY NEVER ATTENDED AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO SAYS I'VE GOT A PROBLEM AND I NEED ACCOUNTABILITY I NEED TO BE IN A FACILITY THAT WILL HELP ME ACHIEVE. ALL THE THINGS THAT. THING FIRST PLUS WOULD PROVIDE AND LET ME SHARE THOSE YOU GET MENTAL. CIRCLE HEALTH TREATMENT TO GET LIFE SKILLS PARENTING SKILLS JOB EDUCATION JOB TRAINING HOW TO DRESS HOW TO INTERVIEW AT CETERA. AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE DENIED SOMEONE WHO SELLS I NEED TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY I WANT TO BE SOMEWHERE. WHERE I CAN RECEIVE THIS AND WE ARE ACTUALLY ELIMINATING FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE FUNDED SO I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION. AND PROVIDE A WAY THAT HOUSING FIRST ONLY IS FUNDED FOR THOSE AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S WHAT- I THINK THE STATISTICS SHOW ABOUT HOMELESS OUT THERE IT'S AN ECONOMIC. ISSUE THEY LOST THEIR JOB AGE VETERANS RETURNING WHATEVER BUT 74% IN THE THIRD. GOING BACK TO THE CHARTS THAT SHOW. YOU KNOW HOW HOW IT'S GROWN THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AND THEY'RE IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND I SUGGEST THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED ANOTHER TOOL. HOUSING ONLY PLUS HOUSING FIRST PLUS POLICY WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE. ARE A HUGE IMPACT I BELIEVE YESTERDAY THE MAYORS OF LARGE CITIES ACTUALLY APPEALED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO I'M JUST ASKING US TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK. MAYBE NOT IN THIS ROUND BUT GOING FORWARD IF SOMETHING I THINK IS REALLY VITAL TO REALLY GETTING AT THE HEART OF OUR HOMELESS PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ALL ARE ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM WOULD LOVE TO AND HOMELESS. ENOUGH NO QUESTION. AND THERE ARE OTHER HOT. TECHNIQUES THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE ACHIEVING THAT AND WE SHOULD EMBRACE THOSE THAT SHOULD NOT BE A SINGLE. APPROACH ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID THAT THEY'RE OING TO LOSE OUR FUNDING ON THAT THAT WOULD NOT GO AWAY. SO WITHOUT TOM I THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST DEBATE WE'VE HAD IN HERE AND CERTAINLY ALSO. IN THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE WHICH IT DID MAKE IT OUT- I WAS HOPING WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT SPENT TIME. ARE SINCE OUR CHAIRMAN IS STILL QUESTIONING AT- MAYBE IT WON'T THAT TIME WITHOUT A CLOSE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTING YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU CENTER BREAK I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT HOUSING FIRST DOES ALLOW FOR SOBER LIVING. HOUSING YOU SIMPLY CAN'T PICK SOMEONE IF THEY IF THEY RELAPSE BUT I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE ON THAT I RESPECT YOUR POSITION ON IT.
