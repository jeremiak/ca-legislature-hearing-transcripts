MARK IN OUR MIND SEPARATE

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:16.394

I DON'T KNOW.

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:37.582
IF YOU HAVE.

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:39.818
A LIST OF HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO

LIVE ON THE ON CAMPUS HOUSING

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.253
[inaudible]

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.124
AROUND THE THE VARIOUS

00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:47.425
UNIVERSITY THIS PUBLIC OUR

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:49.127
PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN

00:28:49.194 --> 00:28:50.128
CALIFORNIA.

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:56.267
BUT I KNOW IN -- SAN JOSE THAT --

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.536
THE RATE AT THE DORMITORY IS

00:28:58.603 --> 00:28:59.871
LIKE SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:02.006
YEAR.

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:03.875
OR I MEAN MAYBE THE STUDENTS CAN

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:06.411
TELL US SOME OF THOSE THINGS BUT

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:08.046
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU THERE'S BEEN

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:09.948
A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY.

00:29:10.014 --> 00:29:11.749
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THIS

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:13.351
JUST BORROWING MONEY A BUILDING

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.086
HOUSING THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:17.188
HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE THE HOUSING TO

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:19.357
KEEP TO DOUBLE THE COSTS DOWN.

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.192
THE COST HAS TO GO DOWN IT'S TOO

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:23.261
HIGH RIGHT NOW EVEN THE ON

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.896
CAMPUS HOUSING IS WAY TOO HIGH

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:25.196
[inaudible]

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.464
SO.

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:29.067
THE QUESTION IS.

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:31.269
WHAT CAN BE DONE TO BUILD?

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:34.205
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS.

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.707
WHAT WITH THE STUDENTS THANK

00:29:35.773 --> 00:29:37.208
WOULD BE AN AFFORDABLE LEVEL FOR

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:38.343
HOUSING?

00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:44.282
IS THERE -- YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT.

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:45.416
ARE LITERALLY.

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:47.952
BORROWING MONEY TO PAY YOU FOR

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:50.688
THE STUDENT HOUSING -- BUILDING.

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:51.489
THERE'S SOME WRONG WITHOUT SAY

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:52.157
[inaudible]

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:54.259
WHY NOT?

00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:57.195
WHY NOT HAVE US FUN?

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.963
THE SERVICE IS SUBSIDIZED

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.266
HOUSING TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:02.267
FUNDS.

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:04.135
AND BUILD THE STUDENT HOUSING

00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:06.271
AND THEN -- LOWER THE COSTS THE

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:07.505
SOON SO DON'T HAVE TO BORROW THE

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:08.439
MONEY.

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:10.141
TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR LIVING

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:11.109
EXPENSES.

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:13.278
SO SO IT WE NEED SOME MAGIC

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.547
THOUGHTS HERE I MEAN -- ALL WORK

00:30:15.613 --> 00:30:17.749
WITH I'M I'M I'M SO HAPPY THAT

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:19.817
CENTER GLAZIERS -- INTERESTED IN

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:21.386
THIS HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT I'M

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:23.888
TALKING ABOUT.

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:24.522
I WILL MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHERS

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:25.523
COULD COMMENT.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.225
IF I IF I MAY YOUR MIND IS

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.093
INTRODUCING YOURSELF PLEASE

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.961
REALLY FIVE SEVEN ONE ASSISTANT

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:31.462
VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:32.864
PLANNING DESIGNING INSTRUCTION

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:34.632
FOR THE ISSUE.

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:36.768
SO WE W WE'RE JUST ON THE FRONT

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:38.736
END OF OF LOOKING AT AT THIS

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:41.639
ISSUE NOT ONLY DOES THIS IS YOU

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:43.174
HAVE A BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE.

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.275
BUT WE HAVE APPROACHED THE

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:46.144
STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TRYING

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.745
TO LOOK AT GRANT FUNDING FOR

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:49.113
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.082
SO THE CHALLENGE WAS OUR

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:53.017
STUDENTS IT WAS GETTING

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:54.652
TECHNICAL AS FAR AS CATEGORIES

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.954
HERS ATION BUT OUR STUDENTS

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.122
DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:30:58.189 --> 00:30:58.656
TRANSIENT.

00:30:58.723 --> 00:31:00.358
BUT WE DID TRY TO LOOK AT GRANT

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:02.193
PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.228
COULD.

00:31:03.294 --> 00:31:05.129
REALLY GET DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:06.097
COSTS.

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:08.199
OTHERWISE WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:09.934
DEBT TO BUILD THE STUDENT

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.669
HOUSING RIGHT SO EVEN IF WE

00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:13.304
BUILD NEW STUDENT HOUSING FOR

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:15.173
STUDENTS AND HAD USE OUR

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.642
EXISTING HOUSING. FOR THE

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:18.743
HOMELESS THERE'S STILL THE

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.079
OPERATIONAL COST AND WHETHER

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:23.581
THERE ARE FUNDS THAT COULD HELP

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:25.650
THE THOSE STUDENTS WITH.

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.385
NOT JUST THE CAPITAL COST BUT

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:30.188
THE OPERATING COSTS TO BE IN THE

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:31.856
DORMSFOR MEAL PLANS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:33.625
SO IT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE WE DID

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:35.593
MEET WITH THE FORMER CITY

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.662
MANAGERS OF IRVINE TRYING TO

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:38.830
TALK WITH THEM ABOUT HOW CAN SEE

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:40.832
THIS YOU PARTNER WITH CITIES TO

00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:41.966
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:43.067
THE REALLY STILL ON THE FRONT

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:45.136
END BUT APPRECIATE THE COMMON IN

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:46.437
AND RECOGNIZE THE HIGH COST OF

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:47.005
LIVING.

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:48.640
CERTAINLY THE BAY AREA BUT IN

00:31:48.706 --> 00:31:51.009
SAN JOSE -- JUST SAY THIS -- RUN

00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:52.543
SO SAM CISCO POSSIBLY.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.911
HOUSING PROBLEMS FOR THE

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:57.982
STUDENTS OF IMMENSE YOU KNOW

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:59.584
THESE KOSTER SO.

00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:01.119
BERKELEY ALL THE YOU CAN GO ON

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:03.655
AND ON UCLA -- THE COST IS SO

00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:05.323
IMMENSE THAT WE HAVE.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.457
TO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE MONTHLY

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:09.193
PAYMENT THAT STUDENTS MAY A LOT

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.261
LOWER.

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:12.530
AND THE TRADITIONAL COLLEGE

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.299
HOUSING FINANCING.

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:17.802
SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE.

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:19.137
IT ONLY WORKS FOR PEOPLE THAT

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:21.306
HAVE THAT.

00:32:21.372 --> 00:32:25.576
HIGH INCOME OR CAL GRANTS THERE

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.045
IS LIKE A CAL GRANT MONEY IS

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:29.013
GOING TO THIS.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.648
SO IF WE CAN LOWER THE COST OF

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.817
THE STUDENT HOUSING MORE.

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.118
MONEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR

00:32:34.185 --> 00:32:35.753
STUDENTS TO GET CALCRAFT FOR

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.288
EXAMPLE SO.

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:38.790
SO IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.725
AT IN A BIGGER [inaudible]

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:44.128
PITCHER -- AND IT REQUIRES

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:46.931
SUBSIDY GRANTS MONEY TO DRAW

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:48.833
DOWN THE COST OF THE FINANCING.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.703
OF LEVERAGING FEDERAL DOLLARS --

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.871
THE USUAL WAY WE WORK WITH.

00:32:53.938 --> 00:32:55.773
BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.208
THE UNIVERSITY'S HASSOUN BRACE

00:32:57.275 --> 00:33:00.078
THAT. TO LOWER THE COST YOU CAN

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:00.812
YOU KNOW I LIKE I KNOW ONE

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:02.780
HOUSING.

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:03.748
BECAUSE WE SPOKE ABOUT IT IN OUR

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.150
COMMITTEE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:08.419
SOME REQUIRE NINE SO THAT WE

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.922
HEARD YESTERDAY AT A HOURS LONG

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:14.359
DISCUSSION MORE LOCAL SO.

00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:16.027
IF YOU PUT UP ONE DOLLAR YOU GET

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:17.929
THREE DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAX

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:19.063
THREE DOLLARS OF THE FEDERAL TAX

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.932
CREDIT SYSTEM.

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.433
SO IS THE BOND POSSIBLY COULD BE

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.235
LEVERAGING THE SOME KIND OF

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.170
FEDERAL.

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:28.072
MIX OF FUNDS.

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.273
TO FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.275
PROJECTS THAT WOULD LOWER THE

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:34.345
COST. FOR THE STUDENTS SO THEY

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:34.979
DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND BORROW

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:36.214
SO MUCH MONEY.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.982
IN A WAIT WAIT WE JUST THE

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:40.485
BORROWING IS A SHAMEFUL THING IN

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:41.919
MY OPINION I MEAN IT'S LIKE.

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.588
IS A DISGRACE THAT WE HAVE OUR

00:33:43.654 --> 00:33:46.257
STUDENTS BARRING SO MUCH MONEY.

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.059
I CENTER A CHOIR IF I COULD MAKE

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.660
AS A RESPONSE BECAUSE I SENATOR

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:50.962

THAT.

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:55.800
CROSSES A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.835
SUBJECT AREAS IN REGARD TO OUR

00:33:57.902 --> 00:34:00.304
UNIVERSITIES -- AND THAT IS THAT

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:01.205
THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT

00:34:01.272 --> 00:34:04.108
THEY'RE OUT THERE -- ISLANDS.

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:05.576
AND THAT THEY'RE NOT ADD THERE'S

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:06.844
NO INTEGRATION IN OUR BROADER

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:10.515

THESE PROBLEMS.

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:18.489
IN SILOS WHERE THE CAMPUSES ARE

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.525
EVEN IN THE EQUATION YOU AND I

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:24.529
FORCIBLE HOUSING MINES IN OUR

00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:30.902
HOUSING?

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.136
AS A PART OF THAT THE SUBSIDIES

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.304
THAT ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:34.071

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:41.112
THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT BECAUSE

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.280
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:43.481

LEVERAGE OUR LAND.

00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:09.634
AND BRING IN A HOUSING THAT IS

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.835
LESS THAN MARKET AND AS

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:12.436
AFFORDABLE AS WE CAN MAKE IT.

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:13.905
THANK YOU THANK YOU SIMPSON.

ALUMNI OF THE YEAR BACK IN.

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:29.153
TWENTY FOURTEEN COLLEGE OF

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:29.921
BUSINESS YEAH.

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:33.658
WE PICKED OUT OF SOME TWO

00:36:33.724 --> 00:36:34.158
HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND

00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:35.459
GRADUATES OF KIND OF A BIG DEAL --

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:36.627
BUT WHAT THIS DISCUSSION IS

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:38.129
MEETING MISSING.

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:40.464
IS OPPOSITION THE SENATOR GLAZER

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:42.633
I'M HERE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.671
THIS MORNING IF I IF I COULD --

00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:47.638
THIS WILL BE PAID OUT OF THE

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.273
GENERAL FUND I'M ASSUMING ON A

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.108
BILLION DOLLAR BOND IS GOING TO

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:53.044
COST IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:53.711
MILLION A YEAR AND PRINCIPAL AND

00:36:53.778 --> 00:36:55.212
INTEREST.

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:56.414
AND SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.215
WHERE THAT COMES FROM WHAT THAT

00:36:58.282 --> 00:37:01.886
PUSHES OUT -- OR WHAT HOW DO WE

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:03.988
RAISE REVENUES RIGHT NOW --

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:06.023
BECAUSE I AM AN ACCOUNTING

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.291
PICTURE I DO READ THE

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:08.326
COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL

00:37:08.392 --> 00:37:10.394
REPORTS NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:12.663
BUT FOR THE REST OF THE STATES.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.265
AND CALIFORNIA IS NOT IN GOOD

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:15.666
SHAPE COMPARED TO OUR

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.902
CONTEMPORARIES -- WE HAVE THE

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:20.104
LARGEST UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:23.140
IN THE NATION -- IF WE DIVIDED

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:26.010
BY POPULATION -- FORTUNY WERE

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.845
ONLY IN FORTY SECOND PLACE BUT

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:29.246
WE WERE IN FORTY SIX PLACE WHEN

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:31.415
I FIRST CAME UP HERE SORT WE'RE

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:32.917
IMPROVING A LITTLE BIT.

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:36.587
OF BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE A MUCH

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.089
STRONGER BALANCE SHEET BEFORE WE

00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:40.091
GO OUT.

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:41.826
THE ISSUE MORE DEBT I I JUST%

00:37:41.892 --> 00:37:43.527
DON'T SEE HOW A FAMILY THAT'S

00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:44.662
STRUGGLING WITH.

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:45.997
BUY A NEW CAR THAT IS WELL

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.665
BEYOND THEIR MEANS -- AND TRY TO

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:48.966
FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THE CAR

00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:51.369
PAYMENT IN THE MIX.

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:52.336
I I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE STATE

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:52.937
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:57.174
GET ON THE STRATEGY FINANCIALLY

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:58.309
THAT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:59.543
REQUIRING HOMEOWNERS

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.145
ASSOCIATIONS TO DO.

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:02.313
AND THAT IS WE SET ASIDE A

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.648
LITTLE BIT EVERY MONTH.

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:05.416
EVERY YEAR AND BUILD OUR

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:07.652
RESERVES AND THEN PAY FOR CASH

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.120
YOU WOULD PAY.

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:11.555
A WHOLE LOT LESS YOU SAVE 50% IF

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.190
WE PAID CASH AND AND WERE

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:14.425
DISCIPLINED.

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:16.761
IN THAT REGARD ANOTHER CONCERN I

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:19.296
HAVE IS THAT. FOR THE LAST SIXTY

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:20.131
YEARS AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE

00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:22.433
HAS BEEN A PRETTY ACCURATE

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.169
PREDICTOR OF AN ONCOMING

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:25.903
RECESSION.

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:49.193
WE DON'T FARE WELL COMPARED TO

OUR DEBT PER CAPITA IS ALMOST

00:39:03.574 --> 00:39:04.075
TWENTY TWO HUNDRED WHICH IS

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:06.277
DOUBLE THE AVERAGE MORE THAN

I AS YOU KNOW APPRECIATE YOUR

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.515
FISCAL STEWARDSHIP I SHARE MANY

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.650
OF THE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT --

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:22.419
UP A PROPER BALANCE SHEET AND BY

00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:23.721
BUT I WOULD SAY THIS THAT --

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:25.222
WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THESE

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:26.090
BONDS WERE DECIDING THAT THEIR

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:27.324
PRIORITIES?

00:40:27.391 --> 00:40:28.692
THE PRIORITIES THAT DATE YES

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:29.927
THEY HAVE FIRST TAKE ON THE

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:31.495
GENERAL FIND OUT BECAUSE THEY

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:32.963
ARE IMPORTANT.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.198
AND THE REASON THAT THESE TYPES

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:34.999
OF BONDS ARE CRITICALLY

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:37.468
IMPORTANT -- IS BECAUSE WHAT

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:38.569
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.538
INSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:41.739
MATCHES THE EXPANSION THIS ISN'T

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:43.641

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:44.475
IT'S ABOUT.

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:45.910
MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.244

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:49.180
SYSTEM -- ARE DOING SO IN A

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:50.247
PLACE THAT'S SAFE THAT HAS

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:52.950
SEISMIC SAFETY BUILT INTO THEM

00:40:53.017 --> 00:40:54.518
WHICH IS NOT THE CASE IN MANY OF

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.719
OUR BUILDINGS.

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.087
THAT HAS SAFE PLUMBING AND

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:58.889
ELECTRICAL ROOST THAT DON'T LEAK

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.758
SO THEY DON'T CREATE MILDEW AND

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:03.427
UNHEALTHY CIRCUMSTANCE -- SO I

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:05.362
WOULD SAY THAT IN YOUR EXAMPLE

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:06.530
THIS IS THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:07.865
WE NEED TO INVEST IN EVEN IN

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.967
RAINY DAYS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:11.602
CAN PROVIDE THAT -- WE CAN

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:13.470
UTILIZE OUR OUR FACILITIES TO

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:15.406
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT AND THAT WE

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:17.341
CAN DO SO IN A HEALTHY HEALTHY

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.843
WAY FOR OUR STUDENTS.

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:20.778
AND SO I APPRECIATE -- WHY THIS

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:21.912
IS GOING TO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:23.647
BURDEN ON THE GENERAL FUND I'D

00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:25.716
SAY YES BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT?

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:27.651
BECAUSE IT'S A HIGH PRIORITY AND

00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:29.119

00:44:48.118 --> 00:44:49.253
BROKE AWAY -- AND GOOD FOR THEM

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.187
FOR DOING THAT.

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:52.156
AND SO -- WILL WE NEED ALL

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.590
CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:56.193
MEET THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.262
AND TO NOT LET THEM -- GET

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.296
DRAGGED.

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.732
INTO THE THIS FUNCTIONALITY OF

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:03.801
CALIFORNIA HOUSING POLICY AND

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.102
AND REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THEY

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:07.671
CAN FOCUS ON LEARNING -- NOT

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:08.238
ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:10.140
SLEEP TONIGHT.

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.775
THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR WINNER I

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:13.077
JUST SOME QUICK CLOSING COMMENTS

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:15.045
AND WILL OFFER US IN A GLACIER --

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:17.481
A THE CLOSING PART DA SO -- IT'S

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:20.584
ALL GOOD LOOK AT BOTTOM LINE IS

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:21.819
THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO BE

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:23.220
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS.

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:25.089
I THINK WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS IN

00:45:25.155 --> 00:45:26.990
THE STATE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:29.026
PAY CASH. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:29.927
FIX IS THAT WE NEED WHEN IT

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.328
COMES A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.330
OUR CAMPUSES I CAN SPEAK CLOSELY

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:34.932
TO THE ISSUES A CEASE YOU NOT

00:45:34.998 --> 00:45:37.634
NECESSARY YOU SEE JUST BECAUSE

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:38.869
OF HUMBLE STAY IN CINEMA STATE.

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:39.937
YOU TAKE A LOOK ESPECIALLY

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:41.505
HUMBLE STATE THE DEFERRED

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:44.208
MAINTENANCE -- IT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:45:44.274 --> 00:45:47.244
UNACCEPTABLE.

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:47.644
SO.

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:49.913
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.914
ABLE TO PAY AS WE GO.

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:52.583
WE'VE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT

00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:54.251
WITHIN OUR GENERAL FUND.

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:55.752
IT IS SIMPLY IS NOT ENOUGH

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.254
BECAUSE WE HAVE IGNORED DEFERRED

00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:58.856
MAINTENANCE JUST LIKE OUR ROADS

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.991
AND BRIDGES AND HIGHWAYS --

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:02.359
IGNORING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:02.926
WHEN IT COMES TO OUR PUBLIC

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:03.894
FACILITIES.

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:06.096
I WHICH IS WHY THIS BOND IS SO

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:06.396
IMPORTANT.

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:08.065
I HEAR THE VICE CHAIR IS AND I

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:09.666
AGREE THAT THERE IS A CONCERN

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:10.968
FOR ABOUT EVERY BILLION WE PUT

00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:12.302
ON IT SIXTY MILLION ANNUALLY IN

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:13.604
REGARDS.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.372
TO PAIN DOWN THAT.

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:16.540
A BILLION BOND DEBT SIXTY

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:17.908
MILLION A YEAR AND FOR THE

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:19.276
GENERAL FUND.

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:22.880
AND THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE.

00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:23.447
WE CAN EITHER.

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:25.149
DEBATE IT [inaudible]

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:26.617
DISCUSS IT.

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:28.552
OR DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:30.554
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE ARE

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.121
HERE TODAY DUE TO MOVE THIS

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:32.956
FORWARD.

00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:34.057
LASTLY IT WOULD ACT WITH A TALK

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.392
ABOUT HOUSING AND I CAN'T ANSWER

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:37.494
SPEAK ON THE U. C. ISSUE BUT

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:40.797
JUST ON THE ISSUE -- I AM DEEPLY

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.132
CONCERNED PARTICULARLY WITH

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:43.267
HUMBLED STATE.

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.568
THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS STUDENTS

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.236
IN FACT IT HAS THE HIHEST

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:47.371
NUMBERS IF NOT THE HIGHEST

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:48.739
NUMBERS OF HOMELESS STUDENTS

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:52.910
NEED TIRES HIS YOU SYSTEM -- AND

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.611
THERE IS A CRISIS IN EACH OF OUR

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:56.847
CAMPUSES THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:58.115
STUDENTS WHETHER IT IS LIVING IN

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:00.117
THEIR CAR COUCH SURFING.

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:01.451
ACTUALLY OUT IN THE STREET.

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:02.886
AN INABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:03.954
AFFORD.

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.155
ON CAMPUS OR EVEN OFF CAMPUS

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.024
HOUSING.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.026
I DO THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE.

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:10.527
A LONG TERM SPECIFIC PLAN BY

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:13.063
BOTH THE U. SIS WAS A CC SYSTEM

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.898
ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:17.100
HAS INNER CAMPUSES -- AND IT MAY

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.136
MEAN ALSO A SIMILAR TYPE OF

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:21.872
INITIATIVE HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:22.472
THE GOOD SENATOR FROM AROUND

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:24.308
HERE TODAY AND HOW WE'RE GONNA

00:47:24.374 --> 00:47:25.108
BE ABLE TO BUILD ADDITIONAL

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:25.776
UNITS.

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:27.811
THERE ARE SOME CAMPUSES THAT

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.713
WE'VE SEEN -- IT'S NO MISTAKE.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.781
THAT ARE SO DESPERATE THEY'RE

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:32.316
GOING OUT TO PURCHASE --

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:34.618
APARTMENT COMPLEXES IN PETALUMA

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.620
TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT STAFF TO

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:37.921
BE ABLE TO TEACH.

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.223
WE'RE AT A CRISIS POINT I DO

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:41.258
BELIEVE ACROSS THE STATE AND ITS

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.626
IMPACT ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN THE

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:44.094
UC SYSTEM AS WELL.

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.262
WHETHER IT'S ATTRACTING

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.730
RETAINING STAFF WITHIN SPECIFIC

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.799
JURISDICTIONS AND OR BEING ABLE

00:47:48.865 --> 00:47:50.667
TO HOUSE STUDENTS I THINK THAT

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:52.002
WOULD WE'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:54.071
HEAR IS WHAT IS THAT NEXT STEP

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:55.672
WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING IN

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:56.673
BEING ABLE TO FIND HOUSING.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.309
LIKE WERE ALSO ABLE -- TO FIND

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:00.344
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON A

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.079
TURNOVER SMILE IF THERE'S ANY

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:04.881
COMMENTS ON THAT -- I'M WITH YA

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:06.350
110010% IN REGARDS THE DEFERRED

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:09.019
MAINTENANCE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:09.853
TO GO AFTER IT -- IF YOU HAVE

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.687
ANY COMMENTS ON THAT AND THEN

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:14.124
ALSO -- IN REGARDS TO HOUSING

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:16.727
CECE'S -- WELL THE ONE COM COME

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:18.762
AND I WOULD MAKE IT I THINK THE

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:20.831
THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THIS

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.833
BILL WAS REALLY FOR THE ACADEMIC

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:25.168
BUILT BUILDINGS AND IT'S FOR

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:26.603
CLASSROOM SPACE.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.206
OBVIOUSLY HOME THE HOUSING ISSUE

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:31.008
IS A BIG ISSUE IN THIS FIVE SAN

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.175
JUAN IT SAID.

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:35.512
WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT --

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:38.048
THAT THAT MIGHT TAKE A DIFFERENT

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:40.651
EFFORT -- I DO THINK THAT THE

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:41.451
THE CHALLENGE OF PLEASE PUSH

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:43.854
BACK ON ME.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.454
IF YOU THINK I'M INCORRECT IN

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:45.822
THIS.

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.057
THE WAY WE ARE TRYING TO BE ABLE

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:48.292
TO HANDLE IT.

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:50.160
WE JUST CAN'T THAT THE THE FUNDS

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:52.129
ARE NOT THERE WHETHER IT IS

00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:53.797
WITHIN THE SPECIFIC UNIVERSE

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:55.565
THAT THE CAMPUS ITSELF OR WITHIN

00:48:55.632 --> 00:48:57.701
THE SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE TO BUILD

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.136
THE NECESSARY HOUSING THERE TO

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:00.070
MEET DEMAND [inaudible]

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:03.140
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE I THINK

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:04.207
WE HAPPEN THAT'S WHY I THINK WE

00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:05.676
NEED A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN WHEN

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:07.110
IT COMES TO HOUSING.

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:09.279
UP FOR BOTH THIS ISSUE SYSTEM IN

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:11.481
THE UC SYSTEM ABOUT HOW WE'RE

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:12.683
GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR IT.

00:49:12.749 --> 00:49:14.551
BECAUSE I I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.186
TRYING TO LOSE.

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:16.953
YOUR INPUT NOT TRYING TO PUT

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.288
WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT TRYING

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:20.023
TO BE A FOCUS IN ON IT NO THAT

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:20.924
IS AN ISSUE.

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.392
BUT REALLY THE ONLY WAY THAT'S

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:23.593
GOING TO SOLVE THIS IS.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:26.063
MONEY IN THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.631
TO BUILD WOULD THAT BE -- RACK

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:29.499
YEAH WE WE NEED THE FUNDS IN

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:32.336
ORDER TO BUILD AND MAKE IT

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:33.437
AFFORDABLE.

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:35.072
I THINK THE OPERATING FUNDS ARE

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.907
OPERATING FUNDS AS WELL OR EVEN

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:37.941
IF WE BUILT IT.

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:40.711
HAZARD PAY FOR THEM TO EAT.

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:44.014
UTILITIES FOR FOR THAT FACILITY.

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.083
SO LOOKING AT OF GRANTS AND

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.018
SUBSIDIES ELSEWHERE AN ONGOING

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:49.786
BASIS IS THE CHALLENGE IS

00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:52.055
ANOTHER PART OF THE CHALLENGE.

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:54.991
AND THEN I I THINK -- YOU ALSO

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:55.192
ARE.

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:57.127
SUFFERING FROM I I I TRACKED IN

00:49:57.194 --> 00:50:01.565
pBECAUSE OF HOUSING AS WELL -- IN

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:02.366
WERE SEEN SOME INNOVATIVE

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.900
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:07.304
ADVANCED RIGHT BUT IT'S COMMON

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:10.006
SIXTY HUNDRED UNITS AT A TIME --

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:12.309
IN THERE'S A BIT OF A WAVE YOUR

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:14.144
COMMENT ON THAT AT ALL.

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:15.412
WELL WHAT IS SO FOR CINEMA

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:18.181
FORTUNATELY THE CAMPUS WAS ABLE

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:19.649
TO PURCHASE A HOME AT LUMINA

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:19.850
YEAH.

00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:22.819
PROPERTY OF BUT BUT IT'S A

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.221
CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:25.922
BEEN FIRES IN AREAS YOU KNOW

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:28.291
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF HOUSING FOR

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:29.893
FACULTY AND STAFF AND AND

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.228
STUDENTS THAT CAN AFFORD IT IN

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:33.997
IN ADDITION TO THE HOMELESS SO

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:34.965
IT IS A CHALLENGE IN CERTAIN

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.633
AREAS AND IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.336
IS SUCH A HIGH COST AREA IT'S

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:40.771
HARD TO FIGURE OUT AND COME UP

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:42.239
WITH A MASTER PLAN.

00:50:42.305 --> 00:50:43.573
BUT I THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.308
NEED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL

00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:46.777
COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT'S WHAT

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:47.778
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FIND OUT

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.479
WHAT WE CAN DO TO WORK WITH OUR

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:50.714
CITIES.

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.482
AND UNDERSTAND THE ROAD MAP FOR

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:53.717
YOU KNOW HERE THEIR FUNDING IS

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:57.254
AN IS OUR ABILITY TO WORK

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.555
TOGETHER ON SOME PROJECT.

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:00.190
AND I THINK AGAIN -- NOT TRYING

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:01.291
TO DICTATE WHERE YOU ALL THINK

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:06.890
BIGGER THAN THE INSTITUTION BUT

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:07.657

DUE TO BUDGET SHORTFALLS.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.162
WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT FAMILIES
