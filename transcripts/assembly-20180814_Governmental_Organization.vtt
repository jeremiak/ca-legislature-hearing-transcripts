THAT THE TRIBE IN THAT IS THE

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:31.702
FACT THAT.

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:33.604
THEIR RESERVATION AND THE VERY

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:35.673
MIDDLE OF THE RESERVATION IS IS

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.478
A SPANISH LAND GRANT WHICH IS --

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:39.129
TWIST TO IT DOES ALLOW FOR THREE

00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:40.397

TERMS THAT WORK FOR FOR BOTH

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.584
PARTIES AND AND I THINK FROM

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.887
THAT THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE AS

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:04.488
LONG AS WE HAVE EFFECTIVE.

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:06.757
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT DO WE HAVE

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:08.926
THE PROVISIONS FOR THE GUARDIAN

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:10.160
VIABLE MITIGATION --

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.795
DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:14.765
OF OF IT TRIES RESERVATIONS SOME

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:16.734
TRIBES MAY --

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.237
SEEK TO A GAME AND TO FACILITIES

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.573
SAM THREE SOME HAVE AGREED TO

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.841
ONE JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:27.278

AND WE'RE PLEASED THAT THAT --

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.550
I THINK IT WORKS FOR THE TRIBE

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:34.752
BUT IT ALSO WORKS FOR THE STATE

00:42:34.818 --> 00:42:35.886

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:11.789
DONE IN MARKET SHARE.

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:13.223
IF THAT'S SUSTAINABLE ON HOW

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.825
THAT COULD WORK AT JUST BECAUSE

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:16.026
OF THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:16.927
COMPETITION.

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:18.896
AND HAVING THREE WOULD THAT BE

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:20.631
SUSTAINABLE YEAH THAT'S A GREAT

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:21.899
QUESTION --

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.267
VICE CHAIR I WOULD SAY THAT THAT

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:25.235
THE COMPACT ALLOWS THE TRIBE THE

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:27.137
FLEXIBILITY TO GROW THAT DOESN'T

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:29.039
MEAN THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.674
HAVE THREE OR THAT THEY'RE GOING.

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.743
TO GO TO TWO THOUSAND I THINK WE

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:33.844
ALL KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:35.713

GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:38.248

LEADERSHIP AND THE MEMBERSHIP TO

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.369
GET SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT.

00:43:58.435 --> 00:44:00.304
THAT WHAT THEY GAVE UP WAS WAS

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:02.973
WORTH WHAT THEY GOT.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.008
