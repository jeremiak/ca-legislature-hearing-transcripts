LABOR COMMITTEE BILL AB TWO OH FIVE WHICH MAKES TECHNICAL CHANGES THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS INJURY ILLNESS AND VIOLATIONS OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY PROVISIONS THE LABOR CODE. THESE TECHNOLOGIES OF A LANGUAGE ONLINE WITH FEDERAL OSHA STANDARDS AND CREATE UNIFORMITY IN THE LABOR CODE. THESE CHANGES ARE NEEDED BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FEDERAL OSHA AMENDED IS REPORTING REGULATION TO CHANGE THE TYPE OF WORK RELATED INJURIES ON PLAYERS MUST REPORT. COVERED EMPLOYERS MUST REPORT ALL WORK RELATED FATALITIES HOSPITALIZATIONS OF ONE OR MORE EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS ANY AMPUTATION LÃ  SOMETIME. ANY STATE WITH ITS OWN OSHA PLANTS JUST CALIFORNIA MUST MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO CONFORM TO THE FEDERAL OSHA REPORTING REGULATION. IN ADDITION IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WHICH MENTALLY BECAUSE SECTION SIXTY FOUR THIRTY TWO TO CHANGE LEGAL CENTER FOR CLASSIFYING A VIOLATION AS SERIOUS. THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO AND TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR CREATE INCONSISTENCIES LABOR CODE BECAUSE A BILL TO AMEND ALL THE SECTIONS OR LEAD TO SERIOUS VIOLATIONS STANDARD. TECHNO CHANGES IN THIS BILL CORRECT THESE INCONSISTENCIES INCREASED UNIFORMITY AND LABOR COVER THAT ARE RESPECT YES RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN STAGGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPORTANT TECHNICAL CHANGES MENTIONED BY SOME MEMBER KALRA THE BILL ALSO WE THINK GREATLY CLARIFIES THE STANDARD THAT GOVERNS WHEN EMPLOYERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS DO HAVE. TO REPORT SERIOUS INJURIES AND FATALITIES TO CALIFORNIA -- WE DO HAVE A PRETTY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH UNDER REPORTING THESE INCIDENTS WHERE. BY OUR BEST ESTIMATES ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE EXISTING FINALITY IS IN SERIOUS INJURIES ARE REPORTED TO CALIFORNIA -- DESPITE THE FACT THERE'S A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY FOR DOING SO AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS EXCUSE ME THE UNDER REPORTING IS AN ISSUE IS BECAUSE IT OFTEN TRIGGERS AN INSPECTION. AND SO THAT INSPECTION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO THE CALLOUS OR CAN GET OUT THERE IN A TIMELY FASHION -- IF NECESSARY AND ASSESS THE HAZARD TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER FATALITIES AND OTHER SERIOUS INJURIES ARE A RISK -- AND SO WE THINK THAT THIS CHANGE OFFERED BY EIGHTEEN OH FIVE MAKES IT MORE CLEAR FOR EMPLOYERS TO KNOW WHEN THEY DO NEED TO REPORT THESE THINGS AS EXISTING STANDARD OF HOSPITALIZATION FOR AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS -- WE'VE HEARD LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT STANDARD OVER THE YEARS AND AGREE IT CAN SOMETIMES BE KIND OF TOUGH FOR EMPLOYERS TO ASSESS WHEN THEY ARE SUPPORTS TO REPORT WITHOUT IN THE LAW. BUT CHANGING IT TO JUST HOSPITALIZATION SHOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE CLEAR AND SOMETHING THAT OUR IS MORE CLEAR FOR CALLUSES WELL IN DETERMINING WHICH HAZARDS. ARE ONES THAT THEY SHOULD EXPECT AND WHICH ONES THEY ARE WE ARE TONIGHT WITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. NO ONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO THANK THE VICE CHAIR. FOR INDULGING ME IN THIS COMMITTEE AS I WAS PRESENTED TO BILLS THIS MORNING OR HE SAID. THANK YOU.

STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MONEY AND AND OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. SEEN KNOWN PRETTY BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND AND IT'S A GREAT BILL -- IT'S JUST -- EXCELLENT IS WHICH WE HAVE THE MONEY TO USE BUT THIS AN EXCEL HIS WIFE'S -- FOR FOR THAT WHEN IT OCCURS. THANK YOU FOR THAT WE WILL ESTABLISH A ROOM -- YEP SORRY SENATOR JACKSON'S GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. I'M GLAD I'M HERE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BIG. THE BILL AS WELL. I JUST HAVE ONE CONCERN THAT I HAVE. AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS EXPRESSED OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS. AND THAT IS. GETTING MORE WOMEN. I INTO THE PROGRAM SO AND I KEEPING ASSURE THAT THEY'RE TRYING. AND AFTER ONE HERE NOW BUT TWENTY YEARS ON AND OFF -- I'M WONDERING HOW WE'RE DOING AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE MIGHT BE SOME OPPORTUNITY. TO BILLS. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN WHO ARE IN THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE I I I KNOW THAT -- IT'S TRYING BUT I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A LOT F SUCCESS AND I THINK WE NEED. TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF CRITERIA THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS COMMITMENT. NOT ONLY IS REAL. BUT EFFECTIVE SO -- IF YOU COULD IT IS A QUESTION THAT SYNERGIZE THAT'S A GREAT POINT AND I WAS IN LIGHTENED UP A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND APPRENTICESHIP MOVIE THAT I WITNESSED AND SAW THAT. THE GREAT SUCCESS ALONG THOSE SAME THOSE LINES -- IN TRYING TO ENGAGE MORE A WOMEN INTO THE PROFESSIONS AND THIS TO THE IS IN NEED OF HAPPY THOUGH TO ANSWER I AGREE BEFORE I CAME HERE WHEN THINGS I DID RUN WAS OF PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM -- WITH THE BUILDING TRADES TO GET NGUYEN IN ALL FOLKS INTO -- TRADE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND I WILL SAY I AM WITH. GOING OUT AND RECRUITING WOMEN -- GETTING THEM TRAINED UP GUARANTEEING THEM PUT BASICALLY GUARANTEE THEM POSITIONS IN APPRENTICESHIPS GUARANTEEING THEM LIKE JOBS IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OF OF SOME -- FEDERAL GOALS WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE -- WE WOULD HAVE WOMEN GO THROUGH ARGUES BUILD A PRE APPRENTICESHIP WHO AT THE END WOULD SAY I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AND SO. I I THINK I'M PROBABLY A LITTLE SOFTER ON THE TRADE ON THIS BECAUSE I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT RECRUITMENT RETENTION -- PROGRAMMING THAT WE TRY TO DEAL. IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE WOMEN WHO WANT TO DO THIS WORK AND I'M AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SUCCESS IT'S WILL FULL -- IF YOU COMPARED OF COURSE TO NON UNION APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IT'S OVERWHELMINGLY LIKE OVER 90% OF THE WOMEN WHO ARE WHO GO ON TO JOURNEY LEVEL POSITIONS ARE. GO THROUGH A JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM -- SO SO THE THE TRADES ARE DOING FAR BETTER THAN -- THEIR THEIR NON UNION COUNTERPARTS -- BUT WE WE HAVE A IT'S IT'S LARGER DISCUSSION AND I THINK WE SHOULD PUT SOME GOALS AND EVERYTHING BUT IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE MAYBE EVEN US AS AS WOMEN LEGISLATORS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE GET WOMEN -- GIRLS MORE EXCITED ABOUT THESE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN -- AND KIND OF GO THROUGH THE STEPS OF OF OF EVEN THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM BE LIKE HEY THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO -- WHICH WE HAVE TO RESPECT I MEAN WE CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO TAKE A JOB THAT THEY DON'T WANT. I'M MAEVE MAYBE WE'RE NOT STARTING EARLY ENOUGH I I THINK AND AND THIRTY THERE'S ALWAYS OF COURSE THE OUTSTANDING ISSUE OF BATHROOMS ON THE JOB SITE WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD ADDRESS. IT IS SIMPLY CHAIR OF MEMBER SIDE THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON AND AND DOES A VERY. A GOOD EXPLANATION BY -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGARDING THE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS -- BUT WE ALSO ALIGNED THE POLICY THROUGH THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN STATE LAW SO RIGHT NOW OF ANY -- WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD DOLLARS FUND ANY PRE APPRENTICESHIP WORK AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN FOR THE ACT OF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF WOMEN IN PRE APPRENTICESHIP. AND THAT IS TO CREATE THE EXPOSURE THOSE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTNER WITH THE LOCAL BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS. THEN OUR PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO INCENTIVIZING THE LOCAL HIGHER PROVISIONS ARE ALSO TARGETING HIRING WOMEN ON THE JOB SITE. IN ADDITION TO THAT -- WHEN YOU PASSED SB ONE THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT FOR EVERY PUBLIC AGENCY TO ACTUALLY GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND ALSO TARGET FOR PRE APPRENTICESHIP PREPARATION -- WOMEN -- PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY MINORITIES L. G. B. T. NOT ONLY FROM THE WORK FORCE COMPONENT BUT ALSO FROM THE EMPLOYER TYPE SO CONTRACTORS ARE ALSO FITTING THAT -- THERE'S ALSO OUR WORK SURROUNDING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. ABA BROTHER WAS A SENATE HEARING TODAY ON THE ASSEMBLY OF BILL FORTY EIGHT THAT DEALS WITH THE BOND THERE'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THERE ARE A LOT OF TWO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. WE WOULD URGE YOU TO HAVE ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS SO THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN AND ALSO GET PEOPLE EARLY EXPOSED TO THESE GREAT CAREERS IN CONSTRUCTION. SO THERE ARE DEFINITELY POLICY -- THAT ARE SORT OF MEETING THROUGH THE PIPELINE FROM CAREER TACK TO PRE APPRENTICESHIP AND THEN THE PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HIRING. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE NOW OVER TWO THOUSAND WOMEN IN THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND WE'VE NEVER HAD THAT HIGH OF NUMBER. BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. I APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE SOMETIMES ARE LITTLE THINGS LIKE LACK OF BATHROOMS. WE KNOW THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO WOMEN THEY CAN'T JUST GO OUT AND TO THE IMPORTANCE OF MEN TO IT AS WELL THAT'S TRUE BUT OUR ADVISORS REQUIREMENT FOR BATHROOMS JUST MAYBE NOT. THE BATHROOM WE WANNA YES. ART WELL AGAIN -- AND I WON'T PURSUE THAT ANY FURTHER BUT I I THINK THAT IS IT. AND THESE ARE ALL GREAT -- BUT THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING. IS ALWAYS HOW MANY WOMEN THESE ARE GREAT PAYING JOBS -- THE WORK IS I KNOW CAN BE DIFFICULT AND CAN BE CHALLENGING -- BUT THEY ARE THEY THEY DO GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO HAVE SOME THAT FLEXIBILITY GOOD TO UNION JOBS I'M ALL FOR THEM. I I JUST -- I I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS. I KNOW JUDGE JUST TALKING TO A WHOLE GROUP OF WOMEN IN THE TECH WORLD AND A LOT OF THEM START THEIR OWN COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. THERE'S A BROKE CULTURE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BROKE KOCHHAR IN IN THE TRADES IN IN -- YOU KNOW OF THE WORLD AND THANK YOU IN IN THE WORLD I WAS. AND WE NEED TO YES. THANK YOU I WAS TRYING TO BE DIPLOMATIC BUT NO POINT TO THAT SO I REALLY REALLY NEED TO WE NEED TO INSIST I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE O CHANGE THE CULTURE WE HAVE TO CHANGE A CULTURE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING WOMEN INTO THESE JOBS IN SPITE OF ALL THOSE EFFORTS WE'VE TALKED I KNOW BEFORE ABOUT GETTING. YOUNG WOMEN IT WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG GIRLS I'VE TALKED TO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE OF WOMEN WHO WERE IN THE TRADE TO THEIR THEIR BECAUSE I HAD AN UNCLE IN THE TRADE OR DAD IN THE NOTION THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY EVEN. CONSIDER THAT AS AN OPTION -- IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO START EARLIER BUT GETTING THEM INTO THE TRAITS AND KEEPING THEM I THINK THERE'S A TRUST IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO CREATE THOSE INCENTIVES GRANTED IF THEY DON'T WANT TO STAY IN THE JOB NO ONE SHOULD FORCE ANYBODY WHY IS IT THAT SO. MANY WOMEN LEAVE AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I TO SEE SOME EFFORT THROUGH SOMEKIND OF pEITHER CRITERIA OR PERCENT SOMETHING. THAT WE HAVEN'T SO WHERE WE SEE A LOT MORE WOMEN IN THE FIELD THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR JUST ANSWER THAT WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU MENTIONED AND WE ARE WORKING NOT ONLY -- TO IN TERS OF THE RECRUITMENT BUT ALSO THE RETENTION RIGHT BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE A GREAT WERE RECRUITED BUT IF THE JOB SITE CULTURE. ISN'T ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY STAY IN FEEL COMFORTABLE AND FEEL SAFE THEN WE HAVE PROBLEMS AND WE LOSE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND WE LOSE ALSO THAT INVESTMENT. IN THAT APPRENTICE BECAUSE IT DOES. COST A LOT OF DOLLARS TO ACTUALLY IS BEST IN THE TRAINING FOR THAT PERSON. SO FOR THAT REASON LAST YEAR WE RAN A BILL BY A SIMILAR MCCARTY YOUR THAT DEALT WITH THE PARTNERSHIP PROTECTIONS FROM HARASSMENT. HOW THE CURRICULUM HAVE TRAINING FOR EVERY SINGLE APPRENTICE THAT'S GOING THROUGH THAT PROGRAM ARE ALSO EXTENDED PROTECTIONS FOR OF THE APPRENTICE ON THE JOB SITE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A CONTRACTOR? IS NOT FULFILLING THEIR OBLIGATIONS FOR PROTECTING THAT APPRENTICE FROM HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS CAN PULL THE APPRENTICE BACK BECAUSE IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE AN APPRENTICE ON THE JOB SITE. BIG BIG GET PAID 40% OF THE PREVAILING WAGE RATE OF COURSE IT'S LESS FOR WHAT THE CONTRACTOR PAYS OUT. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND THEN THIS YEAR RUNNING ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT COULD BE TOLD LAST YEAR BY -- GOVERNOR BROWN SB FIVE THIRTY BY CENTER GALGIANI THAT WOULD CREATE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SEXUAL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION POLICIES. AND WE'RE INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH -- MITCH -- SENATOR MITCHELL'S BILL FROM LAST YEAR -- SB FIFTEEN THIRTY WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THEY KEEP THE CERTIFICATE FOR TWO YEARS AND THERE'S A DATABASE ALSO RECORDING THAT THEY'VE COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE IT THERE ARE MULTI EMPLOYER -- ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS FOR YOU KNOW. SIX MONTHS WITHIN SIX MONTHS COULD BE WORKING FOR SIX DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS SO MY LAST QUESTION IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR TO THE BILL. I KNOW THAT THIS IS AS IMPORTANT TO YOU -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU -- HAVE CONSIDERED OR WOULD CONSIDER TO ASSURE THAT -- THERE. THAT THAT WE SEE MORE WOMEN -- STAYING IN THESE FIELDS BECAUSE THIS IS SEEMS TO ME TO BE A GOOD VEHICLE. TO TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN WELL EVERYTHING REFERENCED -- BY -- MISTER DE AS IS IN THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE APPRENTICESHIP LANGUAGE ARE YOU SAID MC THREE STUFF IS IN THE BILL VIA THE APPRENTICESHIP LANGUAGE. I'M. I WOULD REALLY SUGGEST JUST GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE AND I THERE'S A LOT I I THINK THAT THE TRADES. ARE ARE CAPTURING AT THE JOB LEVEL THE PERNICIOUS LEVEL THAT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN I THINK IN SOME WAYS IT'S GOING TO TAKE US TO NUMBER ONE IT'S NOT JUST A WOMEN A GIRLS ISSUE THERE ARE A LOT OF WE HAVE A GRAIN OF WORK FORCE IF YOU WILL IN CONSTRUCTION. AND A LOT OF THAT IN IN A LOT OF THAT IS THIS IDEA THAT -- SOMEHOW GOING TO COLLEGE IS THE PATH FOR EVERY FIRST GRADER. COMING AND GOING FIRST GRADER YOU KNOW AND NOT REALLY INTRODUCING A NUMBER OF OUR KIDS TO ADD ALTERNATIVE PATH THAT IS A GOOD JOB AND AND VALUING CONSTRUCTION WORK AS WORK WE WE DON'T TEND TO VALUE -- A LOT OF WORK AND AND WE MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR I THINK TO OUR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN -- IT'S IT'S WEIRD WITH CONSTRUCTION WORK RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS REALLY CAN BE A VERY GOOD CAREER -- AND YET SOMEHOW YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T EXPRESS THAT WE CERTAINLY DON'T EXPRESS THAT TO LITTLE GIRLS. AND SO I I THINK WHERE. WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN MAYBE NOT THIS BILL BUT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IS. IS HOW DO WE GET YOUNG GIRLS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO START SEEN THEM AT THIS IS A POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE FOR THEM YOU KNOW -- IF YOU LOOK AT YOU YOU CAN GIVE A HAMMER NOT A REAL ONE OF COURSE TO I CAN GARNER MALE OR FEMALE THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO EQUALLY PLAY WITH IT BUT BY THE TIME YOU GET -- TO THESE WOMEN WHO ARE YOU KNOW. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MAYBE THEY'RE NOT SEEN THEMSELVES IN THAT JOB SO I THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY -- AND IN THE TRADES I KNOW WHAT PARTNER IN THAT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A STEEL AND IT GOES LIKE I SAID ON THOSE TWO FRONTS ONE HELPING YOUNG WOMEN SEE THEMSELVES IN THAT. JOB AND TO VALUING WORK I MEAN VALUE IN WORKING WITH YOUR HANDS AND DOING REAL WORK THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE NECESSARILY A COLLEGE DEGREE AND I THINK WE THOSE ARE SOME OF THINGS THAT WE ARE LACKING IN OUR HOW WE APPROACH. SO OUR STUDENTS AND AND I AGREE WITH EVERY BIT OF THAT I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAID A A REQUIREMENT THAT HAS TO BE MET -- PEOPLE ARE. WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO MEET IT. AND AND I JUST WONDER IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO THAT WOULD. YOU KNOW KNOW WE HAVE FANS BUT RIGHT EXCUSES FIGURE IT OUT GET THERE I I'M JUST AFRAID WE WOULDN'T THERE'S JUST NO POSSIBLE WAY TO MEET THAT RIGHT IN ANY ANYTHING THAT IS UP SUBSTANCE REALLY -- YOU KNOW I AM WERE NOT THERE IT WORK WERE SO FAR AT THE I CAN'T EXPLAIN TO YOU THE FRUSTRATION I HAD WHEN. WE WOULD WE WOULD PUT -- THESE YOUNG WOMEN OFTEN SINGLE MOMS YOU KNOW THEY WERE THEY WERE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEARS OLD ARE YOU STILL PROGRAM WE GET THEM THEIR GED SOMETIMES ARE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. PREPARE THEM FOR AN APPRENTICESHIP EXAM AND EXPOSE THEM TO A CONTROLLED WORK SITE SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE SOME THE SAME ISSUES WITH REAL BATHROOMS AND AND FEMALES ON THE JOB. AND YET STILL. TO THE TEA EVERY SINGLE STUDENT WHO CAME THROUGH A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHO IS A FEMALE CHOSE NOT TO GO INTO THE APPRENTICESHIP TRAITS AND SO IT WASN'T -- AND I THOUGHT NOT IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT IF WE CAN'T CONVINCE SEES THESE YOUNG WOMEN WITH THE OPPORTUNITY OF A GOOD JOB AND THEY TAKE. YEAH I THINK I'M AGO -- WORK FOR YOU PASS ARE GONNA GO YOU WHICH IS GREAT IT'S GOOD JOB TOO BUT YOU KNOW I WE WE WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH OTHER OPPORTUNITIES CAME THROUGH THE LABOR COUNCIL SO WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE THEM A GOOD UNION JOB. BUT I COULD NOT GET A SINGLE YOUNG WOMAN THROUGH THAT PROGRAM TO GO INTO THE TRADE SO WE'VE WE'VE GOT. REAL PIPELINE PROBLEM THANK YOUNG THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD TO TO IT -- THAT THAT I AGREE AT AT ARMS TO DISS INVITATION HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE INTERNATIONAL -- WOMEN IN THE BUILDING TRADES CONFERENCE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN I WALKED IN THE CONVENTION CENTER I WAS BLOWN AWAY THAT THER ARE HUNDREDS OF WOMEN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. COUPLE THAT EXPERIENCE AND AND TO HEAR FROM THEM WOMEN WHO SPENT THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS AND TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. COUPLE THAT WITH THE WOMEN AT FOLSOM PRISON HERE WHO ARE GRADUATING WITH MULTIPLE CERTIFICATES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUILDING TRADES AND I THINK IT'S THE OTHER WORK WE DO IT'S EASY TO PUT OUT A QUOTA. BUT IF THE OTHER WORK WE DO IN EDUCATION IT'S THE WORK WE'RE DOING AROUND -- WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. THAT WILL CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT WILL BE SAFE AND COMFORTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE TO WOMEN TO GO. THE WOMEN I MET THE WORK SITE OUT AT THE NEW A KAISER FACILITY OF MY DISTRICT OF THE ELECTRICIANS THE WOMEN I WORKED WITH. THE MET AND TALKED TO TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES WHEN THERE'S A WOMAN ON THE SIDE IN THE SUPER BIZARRO POSITION. WHO THEY CAN SEE THEMSELVES TO HER AND THEY ALSO KNW HER BEING THERE AND IN A LEADERSHIP ROLE CREATES A CULTURE ON THE WORK SITE THAT'S EVEN UNSPOKEN? NO DIFFERENT THAN OUR EFFORT TO GET MORE WOMEN ELECTED JUST AT YOUR WORK AROUND OUT WOMEN APPOINTED TO BOARDS AND AND ALL THE RESEARCH SHOWS NOT JUST ONE WOMAN CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT IF THERE'S THREE ON THE BOARDS IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE EXPERIENCE OF A WOMAN. BEING THERE SO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO IT'S IT'S AN ORGANIC ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. OUR WORKPLACE SAFETY IN CULTURE SYSTEM ALL OF THOSE AREAS. I THINK WE'LL CREATE YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR WOMEN TO TO SEE IT IN A VERY DIFFERENT LIFE WAS NOT JEST. PUSHING BACK ON YOU ALL IN TERMS OF THE PRINT TO SHIP TO ALL THE OTHER WORK WE HAVE TO DO COLLECTIVELY TO KIND OF CREATE THE DESIRE. AND THE CULTURE AND THE SAFETY AND THE BEING ABLE TO SEE YOURSELF IN THAT PROFESSION SO I SUPPORT THE BILL -- HAVE YOU ALREADY VISITED AB FIFTY ONE NOT YET OKAY GREAT WE NEXT IN AND WE WILL I DO NOT KNOW ESTABLISH A QUORUM. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I'LL MOVE THE BILL WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. SENATOR HILL HERE CENTER HILL HERE MORRELL. HERE MORRELL HERE JACKSON. ROUTE JACKSON HERE MITCHELL HERE MITCHELL HERE PATH. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM ESTABLISHED AND WE HAVE A MOTION FROM US SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AS AT LOOK FOR TO TO WORKING WITH -- YOU SENATORS ON A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THIS I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE -- WE WEEK IF WE FIND SOMETHING WE CAN PUT IN THE BILL AYE AYE I THINK WERE A COUPLE YEARS OFF BEFORE WE CAN FIND A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS BILL SO. WE HAVE SOME TIME TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I BELIEVE. HOPEFULLY AS IT PASSES THANK YOU THANK YOU THE MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] NO [inaudible] NUMBER [inaudible] TWO AND I WOULD APPROPRIATIONS. I THOUGHT IT. CREATION. WOULD DETERMINE WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE IS THE PERCENTAGE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS [inaudible] SENATOR HILL. HI. I'M AROUND. MORRELL NO JACKSON. CHECK ON MITCHELL AYE MITCHELL AYE PAN. IT HAS THREE VOTES ON OF TO GET UP WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ACTION MEMBER THANK YOU AND WE'LL MOVE NOT ITEM NUMBER ONE AB FIFTY ONE PLEASE. PROCEED. THANK YOU. I'M AB FIFTY ONE I THINK YOU HAVE ALL SEEN BEFORE I BRING IT BACK TO BACK THIS YEAR AFTER IT WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. IT IS SIMPLY A PROHIBITION AGAINST -- BINDING ARBITRATION FORCE BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT IT'S NARROWLY CRAFTED TO HOPEFULLY AVOID ON THE THE CHALLENGE OF A COURT DECISION -- OF COURSE IT WILL GET TAKEN TO COURT IF IT PASSES AND GET SIGNED -- BUT WE THINK THIS IS AN APPROACH THAT ENSURES THAT ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO VOLUNTARILY WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WHEN TWO PARTIES ENTER INTO IT VOLUNTARILY. IT'S NOT MEANT TO DISCOURAGE THE USE OF A VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IT'S SIMPLY -- MEANT TO ENSURE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO CREATE REALLY STRONG ROBUST LABOR LAWS IN CALIFORNIA THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IT HERE TOO AND THAT THAT A WORKER HAS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO UTILIZE EITHER THE COURT SYSTEM OR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RIGHTS -- IN THE WORKPLACE ARE ARE RESPECTED -- AND THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GIVE THAT UP AS A CONDITION TO GETTING A JOB OR GETTING -- A RAISE OR OR GETTING PROMOTED SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HIM ABOUT HAVE A COUPLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIRST WITH THIS IN SUPPORT MR CHEN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. I'M ONCE AGAIN. AT YOUR ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IN. TWENTY TWELVE ONLY 16% OF WORKERS WERE IN THESE ARE. MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT WAS A SUPREME COURT DECISION -- ESTABLISHING THAT EMPLOYERS COULD REQUIRE WORKERS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT AND SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE NUMBERS SKYROCKET AND WE'VE REALLY SEEN THE USE OF THESE AGREEMENTS CHANGE. INITIALLY THEY WERE SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE COMMON IN A CORPORATE SETTING. FOR EXECUTIVES WHO WERE MAYBE MORE IN A POSITION TO NEGOTIATE OVER THE TERMS OF THEIR WORK WHAT WE SEE NOW IS THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY FAST FOOD WORKER. IS SENDING A FORCED ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO GET THEIR JOB THESE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS ARE USED PREDOMINANTLY IN THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE. ALMOST ENTIRELY WOMEN IN THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MOST IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE WOMEN OF COLOR THAT. CAME OUT IN A REPORT BY THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE SO IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR LAST CONVERSATION BECAUSE I ALWAYS. LOVE IN LABOR COMMITTEE HOW ALL ISSUES TIED TOGETHER ACROSS BILLS IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT LAST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WOMEN FACE ON THE JOB IN WHETHER IT'S IN MALE DOMINATED INDUSTRIES. WHETHER IT'S ISSUES AROUND -- WAGE THEFT WHICH IS OFTEN LINKED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT THOSE AT THOSE TEND TO HAPPEN TOGETHER -- ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF ABUSES THAT BOTH WOMEN AND MEN SUFFER ON THE JOB AND THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS SUFFER MOST. THOSE WORKERS ARE TRAPPED IN THE EMPLOYERS PRIVATE CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION SYSTEM THAT MEANS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE WORKERS MAY BE GETTING HARASSED BY THE SAME PERSON. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TOGETHER. NO ONE OUTSIDE THAT COMPANY KNOWS THAT THE SAME PERSON IS ENGAGING IN REPEATED SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAST YEAR WE BROUGHT OUT GRETCHEN CARLSON WHO HAD BEEN THE FOX NEWS ANCHOR. ON WHO'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF THIS HAPPENING WHERE. WE KNOW BECAUSE OF THESE FORCED ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS THERE WAS WIDESPREAD HARASSMENT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS THAT WAS NEVER DEALT WITH BECAUSE IT PROTECTED THE ABUSERS. SADLY STATES ARE VERY LIMITED IN WHAT THEY CAN DO IN THIS ARENA THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION IS VERY BROAD. THAT'S WHY ALL THIS BILL DOES IS MAKE IT OPTIONAL IT SAYS THE EMPLOYER CAN USE FORCE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION THEY CAN USE ARBITRATION. OF ALL DISPUTES THEY CAN CLOSE OFF YOUR ABILITY TO GO TO COURT TO GO TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO GET ANY ASSISTANCE OUTSIDE OF THE EMPLOYERS HIRED ARBITRATOR. BUT THEY HAVE TO GIVE YOU THAT CHOICE STAFF TO TALK YOU INTO IT. AND THE OPPONENTS OFTEN TALK ABOUT HOW THEY THINK ARBITRATION IS A BETTER SYSTEM FOR WORKERS FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS THAT'S IN SPITE OF ALL THE RESEARCH SHOWING THAT WORKERS LOSE AN ARBITRATION. THE WORDS ARE MUCH SMALLER AN ARBITRATION BUT THEY SAY THEY ARE VERY GOOD FOR WORKERS ARE ARGUMENTIS. THEN PERSUADE WORKERS TO SIGN THESE AGREEMENTS DON'T MAKE THE MANDATORY THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES THANK YOU BUT THERE'S IN SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMISSION INVESTMENT ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS SAG AFTRA ABOUT A MINUTE TRANSIT UNION MACHINISTS I OF P. T. LOCAL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA ALL IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. HIS BIGGEST SAID IT. QUITE WELL THE ARBITRATION FORCED ARBITRATION WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CHOICE IS. DIFFERENT THAN A PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE ARE BOTH GOING INTO IT ALL ENTIRELY. AND IN OUR VIEW. THIS PROCESS HAS TURNED INTO. A VENUE ARBITRATION THAT ISN'T ABOUT PROCEDURE IT'S ABOUT SUPPRESSING PEOPLE'S RIGHTS THAT YOU WALL GIVEN THEM AND YOUR PREDECESSORS HAVE GIVEN THEM. IMPORTANT LABOR RIGHTS PROTECTIONS IN THE WORK. AN ARBITRATION OUR VIEW BECAUSE OF THE STATISTICS ABOUT HOW OFTEN THE WORKERS WHEN AND ALSO BECAUSE WORKERS JUST ARE DISCOURAGED TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS ALONE. BY THEMSELVES WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. AND IT'S DONE. IT'S THE EMPLOYERS ENTIRE PROCESS IT'S GREAT FOR THEM AND IT DISCOURAGES FOLKS FROM BRINGING CLAIMS SO. IN OUR VIEW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL SO THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE THEIR SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS PROTECTED AND WE ARE DRIVE UP THANK YOU [inaudible] PORT. MR CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY VELMA WE HAVE A THREE GROUPS CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. A CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA WEST ALL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH YOUR BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING JESSICA CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND THE STRONGER CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES NETWORK IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. TEACHER MEMBERS MIKE BONTA GONNA BE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE I PREACH COUNCIL IN THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. VERY CLEAR SHE HARM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA PLAN MILLERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RENEE BY RSA YOU CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THOSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING -- ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED AB -- FIFTY ONE I AGREE WITH A LOT OF COMMENTS THAT THE PROPONENTS ACTUALLY MADE I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGED IF PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED ALMOST THE EXACT SAME BILL LAST YEAR -- AND SAID A PLANE AT PLAINLY VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW AND EVEN CITED TO SOME OF THE SUPREME COURT CASES THAT HAVE BEEN DECIDED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT HAVE CONSISTENTLY HELD. THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT SEEKS TO INTERFERE WITH THIS -- DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OR LIMIT THE USE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WILL BE PRINTED IN THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT IT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE IT'S NOT A STATE ISSUE UNTIL THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT CHANGES THERE'S NOT A LOT THAT STATES CAN DO IN THIS AREA -- A BILL THAT WAS PASSED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AND SIGNED INTO LAW A FEW YEARS AGO ALSO SAID THAT AS A CONDITION OF A CONSUMER CONTRACT -- YOU COULD NOT HAVE AN ARBITRATION BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME ARGUMENT MADE THAT IT HAS TO BE VOLUNTARY AND THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT AS A CONDITION OF A CONTRACT. THIS BILL IS THAT PROPONENTS HAVE A PRESENTED SAYS THAT AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT YOU CANNOT HAVE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE. THE BILL WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE SECOND DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL AND THE DECISION SAYING IT WAS ALSO THAT LIMITATION ON THE CREATION OF AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WAS ALSO PREEMPTED AND THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT SO I AGREE. WITH PROPONENTS AGREE OF THE AUTHOR THAT THISBILL -- IF PASSED WILL BE CHALLENGED IN COURT AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE STRUCK DOWN AS WELL AS PRINTED IN THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT JUST LIKE THE WEBER BILL WAS AND LIKE SEVERAL BILLS AND OTHER A STATE LAWS HAVE DONE UNDER THE SUPREME COURT SO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE EMPLOYER I CAN OBVIOUSLY SAY THAT. THE EMPLOYER WILL BE LEFT IN UNCERTAINTY -- AND WILL BEAR THE COST OF LITIGATION I DON'T SEE HOW THAT BENEFITS THE EMPLOYEES WHEN YOU HAVE UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARDS TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS -- AND THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT IF YOU LIMIT -- DO USE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WHICH THE IF THIS BILL IT GOES FOR IT AS INTENDED WILL CERTAINLY DO -- THE OTHER OPTIONS FOR AN EMPLOYEE ARE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HEARING OR GOING TO COURT AS AGAIN THE PROPONENTS MENTIONED WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HEARING IN FACT -- I THINK THAT THAT'S AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY MUCH TO RESOLVED LABOR DISPUTES -- WITHOUT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED LITIGATION WHICH INCLUDES OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT COURT COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES INCLUDED IN THAT -- BUT THE OTHER PATHWAY IS LITIGATION -- AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY. GREAT -- BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT SENATOR MITCHELL'S PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH. CAME OUT THIS YEAR AND SAID THAT THEY WOULDN'T THEY REVIEWED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED SETTLEMENTS THAT WERE DONE UNDER THE LABOR CODE. IN 75% OF THOSE CASES THEY FELL ON THAT THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS FAILED OR GOT A MARGINALLY PASSING RATE FOR PROTECTING WORKERS INTERESTS. MEANING THAT THEY WERE IN ADEQUATE AND PROTECTING WORKERS INTEREST ON THE DEBT LABOR CODE AND SO AGAIN IF YOU'RE BANNING ARBITRATION OR LIMITING THE USE OF ARBITRATION AND YOU HAVE TO PATHWAYS WHEN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WHICH CERTAINLY DOESN'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO RESOURCES -- AVAILABLE TO HANDLE THESE CASES AND THEN YOU'RE SENDING THEM TO LITIGATION YOU'RE SENDING THEM TO A FORUM IN WHICH THERE HAS BEEN A FINDING BY OUR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AGENCY NOT ME. NOT THE BUSINESS GROUPS BUT OUR LABOR AGENCY IN WHICH THEY SAID THAT THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL HAVE FAILED IN PROTECTING WORKERS INTERESTS SO AGAIN I DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL BENEFITS EMPLOYERS I CAN SIR YOU IT DOESN'T BENEFIT EMPLOYERS. I DON'T SEE HOW PROTECT SIMPLY INTERESTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU. PLEASE DON'T HI CAM STONE ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIAN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. ARBITRATION IS A LEGITIMATE FAIR AND EFFICIENT WAY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES -- I THINK AT SOME OF THE UNION GROUPS AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A BILL LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE TO ALLOW UNION GROUPS TO USE ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE PAGA -- CLAIMS IN IN LAWSUITS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM THEY WANT THAT PROBLEM SOLVED AND THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN STUDIES WHERE PEOPLE WERE -- SURVEYED AFTER EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION AND LITIGATION YIELDED ROUGHLY THE SAME RESULTS BUT PEOPLE ON SOMEONE IRONICALLY FELT MORE HEARD LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT WHEN THEY WENT THROUGH ARBITRATION THEN IF THEY HAD GONE THROUGH. LITIGATION THE EIGHTEEN T. VERSUS CONCEPCION A UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CONTAINED AN ARBITRATION -- AGREEMENT THAT WAS UNDER ATTACK THAT WAS VERY VERY PRO CONSUME THE WAY THAT WORKS IS IF YOU HAD A PROBLEM YOU -- SUBMITTED YOUR PROBLEM AND EIGHTEEN T. MADE YOU AN OFFER TO RESOLVE IT IF YOU DIDN'T ACCEPT THAT CLAIM AND THE ARBITER. AWARDED MORE THAN EIGHTEEN T. DID YOU GOT SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN DAMAGES AND TWO TIMES YOUR ATTORNEY'S FEES. SO ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS CAN IN OUR CRAFTED IN LEGITIMATE AND FAIR WAY IS THE REASONS THAT EMPLOYERS LIKE TO USE THEM IS THAT IT -- REDUCES THE UNCERTAINTY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF SORT OF A JACKPOT JUSTICE OR A RUNAWAY VERDICT THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. TO ABSORB -- CALIFORNIA LAW ARMAND ARE IS AND OTHER CASE LAW HAS VERY EXPLICIT LIMITATIONS ON ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AND CLAUSES IN CONTRACTS THAT MUST BE FAIR IF THEY ARE UNCONSCIONABLE OR UNFAIR JOB -- JUDGES WILL NOT ENFORCE THEM BECAUSE ARBITRATION IS A LEGITIMATE FAIR AND EFFICIENT WAY OF RESOLVING DISPUTES WE BELIEVE IT CAN AND SHOULD BE USED AND RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE SPELL. THANK YOU MISTER JONES -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. COME TO THE MICROPHONE. WHERE DOES THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE FOR THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THANK YOU?

APOLOGIES FOR BEING OUT OF ORDER SOUTH BRAMBLE HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEE NO ONE BRINGING IT BACK. TO THE COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ON BOTH SIDES SENATOR MITCHELL. I WAS A COOPER ON YOUR BILL LAST TIME IN THE I DON'T THINK YOU ASKED ME THIS YEAR MY PACKAGE LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT KIND OF WORKPLACE CULTURE -- SO WELL I APPRECIATE THE SHOP IN THE OPPOSITION I'D LIKE TO BE ASKED ADDED AS A CO OP. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELSON SENATOR -- JACKSON ME. TOO POP BUT I ALSO HAVE SOME. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS -- I THINK ARBITRATION FORCED ARBITRATION IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE TO UNDERMINE JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. THESE ARE NOT VOLUNTARY. ARE THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS -- IT BASICALLY REMOVES THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO HAVE MATTERS HEARD BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS. I ATE IT BAFFLES ME THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS SAID THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSTITUTIONAL. THAT BEING SAID AS I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL IT'S BASICALLY VOLUNTARY. IT DOESN'T IT JUST SIMPLY SAYS AN EMPLOYER CAN SAY TO YOU WE WOULD LIKE YOU AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT TO AGREE TO THIS ARM. THERE ARE CLAIMS THAT THIS -- BILL REDUCES OR THAT THIS UNDERMINES -- THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYERS TO ANTICIPATE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE -- EFFORTS -- I'D LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE I CAN'T. I CAN'T FIGURE THAT ONE OUT MYSELF -- AND ALSO OF RESPOND TO THE CLAIM. I ALWAYS FIND SO INTERESTING THAT EMPLOYEES ARE WELL PROTECTED BY. THE RIGHT. TO TO SUE AND HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT IS IS PROMISED UNDER WHAT I HAS AT LEAST AS I READ THE CONSTITUTION. COULD YOU RESPOND TO THOSE TWO ISSUES SURE -- FIRST I IT'S HARD. TO IN SOME WAYS DRESSED ME -- TO EXPLAIN THE OPPOSITION'S IRRATIONAL OPPOSITION AS I SEE IT I'M FROM A WORKER ADVOCATE POSITION. AT I UNDERSTAND AS REPRESENTATIVES OF BUSINESS -- YA THEY PREFER ARBITRATION -- IT'S SECRETIVE THERE'S NO APPEALS PROCESS ITS FINAL -- WE DON'T KNOW IF THINGS COME OUT FAIRLY IF THERE'S A MISAPPLICATION OF LAW THERE'S NO WAY TO APPEAL THAT -- SO TERE IS CERTAINTY FOR THE EMPLOYER ABSOLUTELY -- BUT AT THE COST OF WHAT AT THE COST OF THE PUBLIC POLICY THAT WE PUT FORWARD IN THIS BUILDING AND PROMOTED AS WHAT WE WANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- YOU CANNOT COMPARE UNION COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ART ARBITRATION I'M WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WORKER YOU KNOW ANYTIME ARBITRATION MADE WORK WELL. WHEN YOU HAVE A EQUALS AND WHO CAN VOLUNTARILY ENTER INTO SOMETHING AND HAVE -- UNMEDIATED DISCUSSION BASICALLY ABOUT ABOUT WHERE THINGS SHOULD GO AND EVERYBODY HAS EQUAL RESOURCES IN FIGHTING THAT. THAT IS A MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WORKER AND THE WORKERS WERE TALKING ABOUT BUYING FAR -- MANY OF THEM DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH -- MANY OF THEM ARE IMMIGRANTS LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO WHO MAY NOT HAVE FORMAL EDUCATION DEFINITELY ARE NOT ATTORNEYS -- AND WHO ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES IN A SECRETIVE PROCESS -- IF THE EMPLOYERS ARE CORRECT AND AND BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER FOR THE WORKER. AT THE EIGHT UNDER THIS BILL WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE WORKER AND GIVE THEM THAT INFORMATION PRIOR TO ASKING BEEN SIGNED ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THAT MAKE CREE ANOTHER PROBLEM I SEE COMMON BUT THEY DO IT WOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT -- AND IT WOULD BE THE WORKERS CHOICE THAN TO DECIDE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO SIGN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT -- IT WOULDN'T TAKE AWAY THE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ARBITRATION IF BOTH THE WORKER AND THE EMPLOYER DECIDED THAT'S THE BEST ROUTE HOWEVER -- WE KNOW THAT THE CONSTITUTION DOES GIVE INDIVIDUALS A RIGHT. TO REDRESS IN COURT SYSTEM IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT THE COURT SYSTEM ITSELF IS TRYING TO TAKE THAT AWAY ARE ALLOWING -- SO MANY BIG CORPORATIONS TAKE THAT RATE FROM INDIVIDUALS I'M I I THINK THAT'S SCARY I A I THINK THAT THAT TWEET WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND AS FAR AS THE ANTICIPATION OF OF LARGE SETTLEMENTS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT EMPLOYERS SHOULD FOLLOW THE LAW -- AND AND THEN PERHAPS FOLLOW ALL THE LAWS WE SET OUT IN AND PERHAPS THEN THEY DON'T NEED TO ANTICIPATE -- HUGE SETTLEMENTS AGAINST I'M I MEAN I I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CLEAR ON REQUIREMENTS -- FOR EMPLOYERS YES THERE CAN BE SOME PROBLEMS AND AND WE DEAL WITH THOSE -- BUT FOR THE MOST PART IF YOU RUN A BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY AND YOU ARE CLEARLY FOLLOWING THE LAW -- YOU DON'T GET AN ANTICIPATED HUGE SETTLEMENTS AGAINST YOU -- THAT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LAWS -- SO THAT THAT TO ME SEEMS A LITTLE -- AN EASY. AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS GOING TO BE CHALLENGED -- I WILL POINT OUT THAT LAST YEAR AND I BELIEVE THIS YEAR AS WELL AND I HAVE TO GO CHECK SINCE I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T SEND OUT CO AUTHOR FORMS -- THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUPPORTS THIS SO THE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD% BE TASKED WITH DEFENDING IN -- THIS BILL. AT ARGUED IN ALL OF THESE CASES IN AN IN HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT IN THE COURT. ON THESE -- CASES IN THE PAST AND TOOK ALL OF THE DISCUSSION AND ALL THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT -- THE JUDGE'S DECISION WAS TO HELP US CRAFT A BILL THAT HE THINKS AND WE THINK CAN STAND UP TO JUDICIAL SCRUTINY -- WILL SOMEBODY SO ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS BUT DO WE AS CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT WORKERS SHOULD HAVE THE AVAILABILITY TO PURSUE THEIR CLAIMS -- IT VOLUNTARILY THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDING A LABOR COMMISSIONER WHERE THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ATTORNEY -- IN COURT BECAUSE MAYBE SOMETHING IS SO -- BROAD THAT YOU KNOW AFFECTING SO MANY WORKERS IN A CERTAIN -- INDUSTRY OR OR SO IMPORTANT THAT IT'S A PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT OUT IN PUBLIC AND WE SAW THAT A LOT WITH WITH THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE THAT WE WE'VE SEEN IN SOME THESE LOW WAGE -- JOBS AT OR IF THEY PREFER TO HANDLE SOMETHING AND IN ARBITRATION I MEAN THE WORKER THEMSELVES SHOULD HAVE THOSE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND SHOULDN'T SAY. UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE UP ALL THESE RIGHTS -- YOU CAN'T HELP THE STOP AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO STOP IN I'M MIGHT IF I COULD ADD TO THIS OF CONCEPT WAS DESIGNED BETWEEN TWO TO BE AVAILABLE TO BUSINESSES. WHO MIGHT PREFERRED TO GO THROUGH A MORE EXPEDITIOUS PROCESS IN? REACHING RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THAT THEY WERE HAVING WITH OTHER BUSINESSES OF EQUAL STATURE IN AN EQUAL -- FINANCIAL -- THE QUALITY IF YOU WILL AND AS WE'VE SEEN I THINK -- THE THE THE ACT THE FEDERAL ACT BEING REALLY SUBVERTED BECAUSE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN WHEN IT WAS INITIALLY PASSED THAT WAS THE FOCUS. ON THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES WHO WERE IN DISPUTE WITH EACH OTHER TO COME UP WITH RESOLUTION AT THE IN AN EARLIER. STAGE SO. I VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR I I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS LAW HAS BEEN -- MISAPPLIED. THE SUPREME COURT TO SUPREME COURT I YOU KNOW AM HUMBLED BY. THEIR POWER. I STILL THINK THE WRONG -- AND I THINK THE MORE THEY KEEP PUSHING THIS THE MORE IT UNDERMINES AND SUBVERTS WHAT I THINK WAS A VERY WELL INTENDED EFFORT. TO GIVE OPTIONS AND THERE ARE ARBITRATION. ARBITRATORS WHO DO A WONDERFUL JOB. BUT THE SYSTEM HAS SUCH A THUMB ON THE SCALE OF THE QUALITY OF A JUSTICE FOR BOTH SIDES IN THIS CASE IN PARTICULAR WITH EMPLOYERS AND WITH SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO. I COMMEND YOU FOR THIS AND IF THIS IS A CASE THAT WILL GO UP TO THE COURTS SO BE IT BUT AGAIN. IF THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT IF WE GET A CONGRESS THAT ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CONSUMERS AND AND EMPLOYEES MIGHT TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS LAW ON A FEDERAL BASIS I FRANKLY THINK IT WOULD BE INCUMBENT UPON US TO HELP LEAD AS CALIFORNIA DOES SO OFTEN. IN TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHAT ARE THE TRUE VALUES OF THE SOCIETY AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL AND ASKED TO BE A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECT LAST WHEN I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND MAY I THINK THIS IS A THAT TO SALUTE YOU FOR DOING THIS AND BRING IT TO ME I I THINK. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ARBITRATION BUT THE SHOULD BE CONSENT. OR A OR YOUR INTO THE PROBLEMS OF THAT WE'VE SEEN SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR JACKSON'S -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JUDICIARY. SENATOR HILL HI CAM HILL AYE MORRELL. WORLDNOW JACKSON. HI. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. PAN. THE BILL HAS TO GO TO HOLD THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS GOOD MORNING. AND I FAILED TO MENTION EARLIER WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY JUST AS WE DID LAST WEEK. WE WILL ALLOW FIVE MINUTES OF TESTIMONY FOR SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION AND THEN. ALLOWED MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ME TOO FROM THERE FORWARD SOME RUMORS OUT GOOD MORNING AB. ONE TO ME AB TWO OR THREE ITEM NUMBER TWO ON OUR AGENDA PLEASE PROCEED ALL RIGHT THANK WAS CHAIR MEMBERS -- THANKS FOR LETTING ME PRESENT THIS BILL DEALS WITH VALLEY FEVER I THINK I SPOKE TO ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THIS LAST YEAR'S. THIS IS THE THE FOURTH BILL THE PACKAGE THAT WE HAD THREE GOT SIGNED LAST YEAR -- WE KNOW VALLEY FEVER IS ENDEMIC CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE WE KNOW. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CASES GO UNREPORTED EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND WE ALSO KNOW JUST BASED OFF OF REPORTING. THAT ISN'T EVEN WITH THE RECENT -- WILD FIRES UP NORTH BUT ALSO LIKE INVENTOR ACCOUNTING WE SEEN SPIKE'S. OF VALLEY FEVER CASES AFTER THE FIRES BECAUSE OF THE SPORES BEING MOVED -- IN THE GROUND SO THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO HELP WORKERS THAT ARE OUT -- WORKING IN THOSE SENSITIVE SITES AND JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. GOOD THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS PAULA MASSEY IN FROM HANFORD CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- I HAVE TWO SONS MY OLDEST ONE PASSED AWAY FROM VALLEY FEVER AND I LIKE TO SHARE SOME. SOME PIGEONS WITH. OF HIM [inaudible] BEFORE -- THE MIDDLE ONE IS WHEN HE HAD HIS LITTLE A SEIZURE AND OCTOBER EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND NEVER CAME HOME. IN THE LAST PAGES WHEN HE WENT TO HEINZ HOSPICE AND FRESNO -- I DO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THERE NEEDS TO BE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS. WHEN HE WAS? IT'S GOT SICK IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD A LUNG INFECTION FIRST WITH PNEUMONIA. THEN WITH A LONG INFECTION. HE WASN'T DIAGNOSED UNTIL TWO YEARS LATER. WITH VALLEY FEVER AT THAT TIME WAS LIVING IN PHOENIX SO FEW MONTHS LATER I CAME BACK HOME. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HE STARTED HAVING SEIZURES THE VALLEY FEVER THE SPORT THEY GOT INTO HIS BODY AND STARTED SPREADING TO WHAT IS BEHIND. IN HIS BRAIN. IN THE PLEDGE THAT TO SEE HIS BRAIN STOPPED WORKING -- I HAVE SECOND SON. HE HAS VALLEY FEVER. AND HAD WE KNOWN ABOUT THIS WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THINGS ABOUT IT MY SENSE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN PLAYING ON BASE. IN JACK RABBIT FEEL. FILLING DIRT BOMBS AT EACH OTHER -- MAYBE MY OLDEST SON WOULD NEVER WENT TO WORK AT A OF A COMPANY THAT DEALS WITH FARMING. IN THE COURT FEELS. I'VE BEEN TESTED. IT'S IN MY SYSTEM. BUTIT'S NOT ACTIVE ACCORDING TO THEM THE DOCTORS. IN MY LOCAL AREA. BUT I DO HAVE SYMPTOMS. SO I AM FOR THIS AND I DO A LOT ADVOCATING IN MY COMMUNITY. TALKING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS AND TELLING THEM GET TESTED AND IF YOUR DOCTOR WILL TEST YOU GO TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. MY SECOND SON HIS DOCTOR WOULD NOT TEST THEM. BECAUSE HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE SYMPTOMS. BUT HIS GIRLFRIEND MAKE SURE THAT HE WENT TO HIS OLD DR. SHE TALKED TO HIM THE CIVIL TESTIMONY CAME BACK POSITIVE. RIGHT NOW MY SON CAN'T WORK. IS A LOT OF PAIN HE CAN'T SLEEP. SOMETIMES HE HAS NO APPETITE TO EAT. SO I AM FOR THIS BILL I AM. FOR EDUCATION. I MEANT FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IN MY COMMUNITY I HAVE MANY PEOPLE COME OUT CUTTING GRASS BLOWING STUFF. IN THERE NO MASK. THERE'S NOTHING TO PROTECT THEM. I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED IN THE FIELDS WITH A DOING THE SOLAR PANELS. AND THEY'RE SIGNING A WAIVER. THAT IF THEY GET VALLEY FEVER. THIS IS NO GUARANTEE THAT YOU GOT A FROM THIS JOB. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. OKAY SO I AM. I AM PRO FOR THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE SO SORRY FOR THE OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TOM SHE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LANDSCAPE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO OR THREE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUDICIARY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OUT RUBBER MATURE ENOUGH THE CAL CHAMBER IN STRONG SUPPORT AND I'M GLAD TO IMPROVE THIS. SHE THAT THANK YOU. JAMIE CON ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU IS KIND. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD. OF THANK YOU IN BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIR JUST SAW ON BEHALF OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE JEAN FULLER WHO LOST HER SISTER. TO THIS DREADED DISEASE THAT HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT IT'S IT'S A BUT YES ENERGY I HAVE A QUESTION AND YES YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS SHOWING UP NOT ONLY IN VENTURA THROUGH THE FIRE BUT AFTER THE DEBRIS FLOW. A MUD SLIDE IN SANTA BARBARA THAT. WE'RE SEEING THIS. IF SOMEONE IS TESTED IS THERE TREATMENT AVAILABLE THAT CAN EITHER REDUCE OR CURE OR YOU KNOW ASSIST IN. RESOLVING THIS DISEASE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GO ON TO LIVE HEALTHY IN LONG LIVES SO CURRENTLY THERE IS A NO VACCINE OR CURE FOR VALLEY FEVER -- IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET -- THROUGH THE GRACES OF EVERYBODY HERE WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE SOME MONEY. FOR FUNDING WHICH IS NOW GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY RESEARCH TRY. TO GET US TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET TO POSSIBLY A VACCINE AND A CURE -- BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE THAT FIGHT A NO FEDERALLY THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THIS AS WELL -- ALL IT'S VERY ENDEMIC TO THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST. OF THE UNITED STATES SO YOU SEE A LOT OF NUMBERS AND YOU MEXICO. ARIZONA HAS A LOT OF MY NUMBERS TAXES OBVIOUSLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DID THE RESEARCH. OF THE EXCUSE ME OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND UNREPORTED CASES WE FOUND FIFTY OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IT WAS CASES AND FIFTY OF COUNTIES. IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN MOVING THIS. WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THREE PIECES OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THIS IS THE FOURTH PIECE -- THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THAT FOR WORKERS HAVE CAL OSHA STEP IN. A LOT OF TIMES WE FIND TO FOR INSTANCE LIKE IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER FROM PAULA. IS THERE WAS A CREW OUT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY THAT WAS INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS. AND EVERYBODY ON THE CREW CAME DOWN WITH VALLEY FEVER. AND YOU ASK WHAT COULD WE HAVE DONE TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT ESPECIALLY THESE ENDEMIC AREAS. AND SAID YOU KNOW IT'S PUTTING ON A AND NINETY FIVE TO MASK. YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN IN NINETY FIVE MASS THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED. SO MAYBE WE CAN GET CAL OSHA TO SET THE STANDARDS ESPECIALLY THESE HIGHLY ENDEMIC AREAS TO HOPEFULLY PREVENT PEOPLE. FROM GETTING BALLOT ARE THERE TREATMENTS THOUGH IF IF IF WE CAN PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED THEY GET TESTED THEY FIND THEY HAVEN'T WHAT CAN WE DO TO ASSIST THEM. YEAH SO THERE'S A THERE THERE'S SOME MEDICATION THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE EVERYONE'S RESPONDING DIFFERENTLY TO IT AND I THINK pCOMING IN. BECAUSE I KNOW -- SOME OF THE RESEARCH IS LOOKING AT GENETIC MARKERS BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY MORE PREVALENT. AND AND SOME ETHNICITIES AND OTHERS -- AFRICAN AMERICAN IS ONE OF THEM [inaudible] AND AND SO THE RESEARCH RIGHT NOW. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE THIS I WOULD I WAS JUST AT UCSF -- TWO WEEKENDS AGO -- ACTUALLY DISCUSSING SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR UC MERCED IS ANOTHER ONE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. I WITH DOCTOR GALGIANI IS ANOTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO OUR SENATOR GALGIANI. THANK YOU MAN THANK YOU SIR OKAY. THANK YOU CENTER EXHAUST FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND ABOUT HE WAS ACTUALLY FUNGAL INFECTION AND FUNGAL INFECTIONS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO TREAT -- THE MEDICATIONS OFTEN HAS TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS -- AND AND TENSION IS AS THE BRIGHTON OFFICE ONLY WE NEED TO TRY TO WORK ON TREATMENTS AND CURES -- BUT FUNGAL INFECTIONS IN GENERAL OR IS IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TREAT AND OFTEN AND SAID -- THE TREATMENTS AND CELLS ARE VERY DIFFICULT WE DO NEED MORE RESEARCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP -- WE THAT THAT PREVENTION PART IS A VERY IMPORTANT -- I I SHOULD MENTION THAT IF YOU'VE NEVER WORN AND PROPERLY FITTED AND NINETY FIVE MASK. YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT IS ACTUALLY TO WORK WEARING ONE FOR AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME -- SO WE REALLY GOT THINK ABOUT RIGHTY OF MITIGATION APPROACHES AND CERTAINLY THINK THE RATE THAT HAVE CAL OSHA LOOK AT THAT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE UNFORTUNATELY IS ALSO CHANGING THE AREAS RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S A SORT OF A CLIMATE THAT THE FUNGUS THRIVES IN. AND SO THAT IS POTENTIALLY EXPANDING THE AREAS IN WHICH THIS FONG I COULD SPREAD AND BE ENDEMIC IN THE SOIL SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT AS WELL. AND CERTAINLY -- I APPRECIATE -- THAT WE'VE INVESTED SOME OF OUR STATE FUNDS IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND RAISE AWARENESS I THINK IT'S THE OTHER THING I HEARD FROM THE WITNESS LIKE WITH THE DOCTORS AND PUBLIC HEALTH FOLKS IN THE NURSES NEED TO KNOW THEY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT VALLEY FEVER IT'S NOT. ALWAYS NO OBVIOUS THAT'S NOT LIKE IF SOMEONE COMES IN THE VALLEY FEVER RIGHT INTO IT'S A THE SYMPTOMS ARE -- SOMEWHAT -- INITIALLY INITIALLY SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS AND THE PROBLEM IS THEN WHEN YOU GET REALLY SICK -- THAN YOU KNOW AND BUT THEN IT'S THE RATHER LATE SO THANKS SO MUCH RINGS BILL FOR BE HAPPY TO MOVE IT TO PRODUCE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR PAN AND AND I IN THAT FIGHT YOU'VE NOT STOPPED SINCE THE MINUTE YOU GOTTEN INTO THIS BUILDING AND IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A SAFE WORKPLACE AND AND IT'S OUR DUTY TO DO THAT AND PROVIDE THAT -- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED LOOKING AT THE PERHAPS WHEN PROVIDING THE TRAINING OR THE MATERIALS IN THE LANGUAGES THAT MAY BE SPECIFIC. PEOPLE PERHAPS YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT YES NO WE DID AND WE ACTUALLY HAD A SEPARATE PIECE OF UNFORTUNATELY TO ACTUALLY EXPAND -- THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS SO WE HAVE WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT BUT MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND SEE WHAT WE CAN. WE CAN DO TO DEVELOP MORE. OF WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AT NOT JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY VOTER APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SUPPORT -- ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT'S AFFECTING A LOT OF FOLKS -- INCLUDING PEOPLE HERE IN OUR BUILDING. RIGHT -- WITH SENATOR FULLER BUT ALSO WITH THE SIMPLY MEMBER GRAYSON WHO ACTUALLY CONTRACTED VALLEY FEVER AND HE TALKS ABOUT WHAT DOCTOR PANELS TALKING ABOUT. THE MISDIAGNOSIS WHERE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS THE FLU OR OR A COMMON COLD AND SO HE GETS ANTIBIOTICS WHICH DO NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S A FUNGAL DISEASE. AND SO -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SUFFERING IN YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE -- THE THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE ON THIS MEASURE IN JUST A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR PAN. TO OF THE BEST TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE PLEASE CALL. SENATOR HILL AYE HILL AYE MORRELL HI. MORRELL AYE JACKSON. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL.

TEN OH SEVEN WELCOME. NICE TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING. WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MY SENATORS HERE TO GET ME DRUNK I KNOW I ME TO START [inaudible] BE CAREFUL. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS. I WON THE FIRST US START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE. AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU TO CHAIR A COMMITTEE -- FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. AB. TEN OH SEVEN HELPS OUR STATE EMPLOYEES BY PROVIDING. A CERTAINTY. IN THE DISCIPLINARY TIMELINE EXISTING LAW ALLOWS UP TO THREE YEARS TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION THAT MAY RESULT IN RE EMPLOYED DISCIPLINE. THIS MEANS THAT A STATE EMPLOYEE AND OR MANAGEMENT MUST PUT THEIR CAREER AND THE DISPLAY -- PROCESS ON HOLD FOR UP TO THREE YEARS -- IN ADDITION EMPLOYEES CANNOT RECEIVE A RAISE A REQUEST TO TRANSFER OR PUT FORWARD FOR PROMOTION. IN THE MEANTIME -- THE EXISTING EMPLOYEES COULD REPEAT THE SAME INFRACTION ALL OVER AGAIN START THE PROCESS AGAIN AND AGAIN. REDUCING THE TIME NECESSARY TO DISCIPLINE A STATE EMPLOYEE TO ONE YEAR PROVIDES EMPLOYEE AND MANAGEMENT CERTAINTY ALLOW FOR MORE TIMELY CORRECTIVE ACTION. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS JOHN LEVEL REPEATING THE STATE CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISOR SPONSORS OF THE BILLS -- MEMBER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOTH OF WHICH I GUESS SOMEONE ELSE HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF IT -- JOHN LEVEL O BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION AS MISTER JONES SAWYER POINTS OUT WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. AS A MATTER OF SIMPLE JUSTICE OF THE HUMAN CONDITION BEING WHAT IT IS UNDER CURRENT LAW YOU HAVE THREE YEARS -- AND PEOPLE WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT AND SO THE EMPLOYEES CAREER. IS FROZEN -- HERE SHE IS ASSIGNED SOMEPLACE WITH THEIR FROZEN THEY CAN'T -- THEY CAN'T PROMOTE THEY CAN'T LATERALLY TRANSLATE. OF MR NOT THREE YEARS ARE UP. AND THERE'S A DETERMINATION NO FAULT BY THE EMPLOYER A BY THE EMPLOYEE WELL BUT GUESS WHAT THAT EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN HERE RETRIEVAL BILLY PENALIZED FOR THREE YEARS. USING HER CAREER HAS BEEN FROZEN THIS BILL IS A MATTER SIMPLE JUSTICE. WE SPONSOR THIS BILL WE COMMAND. MISTER JONES SAWYER FOR HAVING FOUGHT THIS BATTLE FOR MANY YEARS AND IT'S JUST LONG OVERDUE THAT -- THAT THE ADDRESS THIS. PLEASE SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LEVEL OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO BAKER WITH HER IN REDUCES HIS FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. THANK YOU TO BAKER APPRECIATED -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE SEE NO ONE VERY GOOD WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR JACKSON'S TO QUICK QUESTION -- I I HEAR YOU AND AND CREATED THREE YEARS WHETHER THE PERSON IS AT FAULT OR YOU KNOW IS VIOLATED SOME. WOMEN CONDITION NOT WHY THREE YEARS IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME IN YOUR IN YOUR FIRST THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL YOU REDUCE FROM -- THREE THREE YEARS AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF THE PRECIPITATING EVENT TO ONE YEAR AFTER DISCOVERY. OF THE EVENT AND THEN. YOU HAVE A THREE YEAR TIME LIMIT FOR THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL CASES WHY CAN'T THIS GET DONE WITHIN A YEAR PERIOD OF TIME SO THE RESOLUTION. IS IS EFFECTIVE FOR EVERYONE WHETHER THAT PERSON IS VINDICATED OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE FOUND LIABLE I MEAN. THREE YEARS AS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME TO BE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS IS OR SOME EXPLANATION AS TO WHY IT TAKES THREE YEARS THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE BILL THERE ISN'T -- THE LAW ALL RIGHT NOW IS THREE YEARS FOR ALL STATE EMPLOYEES SO GUESS WHAT YOUR THERE'S THERE'S SOME NAY QUESTION ABOUT YOUR CONDUCT IN. YOUR BACK FOR YEARS. OVERALL ONE YEAR PERIOD EIGHT INCLUDING EVERY [inaudible] HOST. UNDER THE BILL ONE YEAR FROM DISCOVERY RIGHT -- AND THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THAT'S A TIME WHEN YOU CAN DO. ANY KIND OF INVESTIGATION AND FRANKLY PEOPLES -- RECOLLECTIONS REMAIN INVOICE LONGER TO OVER THREE YEARS PEOPLE RETIRED THEY MOVE -- SOME PASS ON TO ANOTHER WORLD -- AND ALL OF THIS IS LOST IN THE EMPLOYEE IS IRRETRIEVABLY PENALIZE SO BASICALLY THIS IS ONE YEAR ACROSS THE BOARD FROM TIME TO DISCOVER YOUR RESPECTIVE OF THE WITH WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS. WHERE YOU HAVE EMBEZZLEMENT WHERE YOU HAVE CERTAIN SEXUAL HARASSMENT ISSUES WHERE WHERE YOU HAVE ROBLEMS OF PEOPLE COMING FORWARD AND DISCOVERY? SO THERE ARE SOME CARVED EXCEPTIONS BUT WITH THIS. BILL DOES IS IT. IT TAKES. THE GENERAL RULE WILL NOW BE ONE YEAR. WHICH OF PARALLELS WHAT HAPPENS WITH PEACE OFFICERS NOW FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT MY CONCERN THOUGH IS IF THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IT'S THREE YEARS FROM THE TIME OF DISCOVER YOU THEY STILL GET THREE YEARS TO INVESTIGATE ONCE IT'S THE MATTERS BEEN BROUGHT TO THEM. THAT SEEMS LIKE A HECK OF A LONG TIME IF YOU'RE THE VICTIM OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR IF YOU ARE THE ACCUSED THREE YEARS -- YOU KNOW WAS THE VICTIM LET'S SAY IT'S AN ACCURATE IT'S INACCURATE ALLEGATIONS. DOES THE VICTIM THEN HAVE TO SPEND THREE YEARS WITH YOU IN IT AT WORK OR IF IT ISN'T AN ACCURATE ONE DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT THREE YEARS FOR YOUR VINDICATION A WHITE THE PURPOSE. OF THAT EXCEPTION. IS BECAUSE WE WHAT WE ARE LEARNING IS. THERE IS A RELUCTANCE OF PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD OVER TIME YOU HAVE ONE INSTANCE AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD MAYBE TO RETURN ON AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT IS IT IS IT THREE YEARS FROM THE TIME THAT THE THAT BEARD ADAM DISCOVERY. FROM DISCOVERY OR FROM REPORT SO THREE YEARS FROM THE TIME THAT THE THAT THE THAT THE ENTITY THE INVESTIGATING ENTITY RECEIVES THAT INFORMATION. BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RELUCTANCE TO COME FORWARD IF SOMEBODY COMES FORWARD WHY ISN'T IT ONE YEAR FROM THE TIME THAT THEY COME FORWARD WELL BECAUSE THE THREE YEARS WE'VE MADE THE RELUCTANCE. MAY ACTUALLY. ASSIST WITH FILLING OUT. THAT MAYBE THERE'S ONLY ONE ALLEGATION BUT MAY BE OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD YES YOU DO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAME FORWARD BECAUSE THEY WERE RELUCTANT TO TO BEGIN WITH THAT'S AN EXCEPTION. THAT'S ONE EXCEPTION THAT WE ARE CARVING -- IN THE BILL BUT THE GENERAL RULE NINETY IS GOING TO BE IS GOING TO BE ONE YEAR. IF BUT IF WE'RE TRYING TO ENFORCE -- IN THE WORKPLACE A HARASSMENT FREE ENVIRONMENT. WHICH AT AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD IF THEY COME FORWARD. THEY STILL MAY HAVE TO WAIT THREE YEARS FOR SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION. TO THAT CLAIM. BOTH AGAIN AS A PROPOSED A VICTIM OR IS A PORTED PERPETRATOR WHO -- DON'T TURN -- WHO? ONCE RESOLUTION OF THIS WHY DO WE GIVE THREE YEARS IN THESE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES I I I JUST THINK THAT IF WE REALLY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT. EXTRACTING THIS FROM THE WORKPLACE TO GIVE THREE YEARS FOR AN INVESTIGATION SEEMS LIKE A AN AWFULLY LONG PERIOD OF TIME. PAUL KIRBY HAVE CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ASSOCIATION UP MA'AM WHAT HAPPENS IN IF IT'S A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE YOUR CONCERN IS TO HAVING THE VICTIM STILL BE IN. CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE SUSPECT OF THE HARASSMENT OF BEHAVIOR ONCE IT'S DISCOVERED ON THE FIRST TIME THAT PERSON WILL BE MOVED TO HIT THAT THAT'S A NORMAL PROCESS THEY WILL MOVE THEM OUT. SO THE FACT THAT IT TAKES LONGER TO INVESTIGATE THESE TYPES OF CASES BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF ON REPORTING AND AND RELUCTANCE ON ON BEHALF OF SOME OF THE WITNESSES. THEY HAVE THE THE VICTIM HAS ALREADY BEEN FOR PROVIDED SOME PROTECTION THEY'RE NOT -- JEOPARDIZED OR PENALIZED -- BY THIS -- ADDITIONAL TIME PERIOD I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THE THAT THIS IS A QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT FURTHER. AND WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE THAT THE ALLEGED VICTIM IS THEN REMOVED FROM THE SITUATION ACTUALLY. THERE REMOVED FROM BUT BECAUSE THE THE PERSON THE PERPETRATOR HAS BEEN REMOVED GOOD I WAS COVER TRAINING MAKES THE MOVE NO THEY MOVED THE PERPETRATOR SO THE THE VICTIM IS. STILL DOING. HER HIS OR HER JOB THEY'RE NOT AFFECTED BY IT ALL UP THE ONLY PERSON AFFECT TO BE THE THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE SAID DID RAISE A RED FLAG FOR ME. BUT I I WOULD JUST ASK THAT IF WE REALLY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THAT WHOLE ISSUE WE TRY TO EXPEDITE -- THE TIME FRAME FOR THAT AS WELL I SUPPORT THIS BUT I THINK THAT IT'S A CARVE OUT THAT THERE MIGHT BE. RECONSIDERED THANK YOU AND I'M HONORED ACTION -- WE WILL HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE AS OTHERS IN SUPPORT. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE ASKED FOR THAT AS OF YET IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. THE NO ONE NOW BRING IT BACKTO THE COMMITTEE FOR CONVERSATION DISCUSSION.

WE WILL DO THAT WE'RE MOVING NOW TO ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB THIRTEEN FIFTY THREE WELCOME TO OUR COMMITTEE [inaudible] MORNING. COMMITTEE HAVE STAFF COLLEAGUES I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY. CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM BY PROVIDING HEALTH NUTRITION ACADEMIC SUPPORTS TO STUDENTS ALTHOUGH CLASSIFIED WORK IS COMPLETED BY THE SAME STANDARD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A DISTRICT IS MERIT DISTRICT OR NON MERIT DISTRICT. CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IN A NON MERIT DISTRICT HAVE A LONGER PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF ONE YEAR WHERE'S THE MERIT DISTRICT ALLOWS FOR A SIX MONTH PROBATIONARY PERIOD. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY THROUGH THREE WILL BRING CONFORMITY AND CLARITY FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE CLASSIFIED STAFF BY ALLOWING. FOR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IN NON MERIT DISTRICTS TOOBTAIN PERMANENT STATUS NO LATER THAN SIX MONTHS. MANY NON MERIT DISTRICTS ALREADY CONFORM TO THE MERIT DISTRICT TIME LIMITS. DUE TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ALIGNING BOTH OF THESE COULD ADVISE SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESS. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND I WILL LET MY WITNESS SELF INTRODUCED NEVER RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR WHEN FOLKS SHOW UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF WE WILL DO THAT. MORE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY DHAMMA BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS -- PROUDLY SUPPORT SUPPORT OF PROUDLY REPRESENTING A CALIFORNIA'S TEACHERS AND ALSO OF HUGE SEGMENT SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION ARE CLASSIFIED SERVICE. AS ARE OTHERS MENTION THIS BILL IS ABOUT FAIRNESS AND EQUITY. A CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SUFFER UNDER PRACTICES WHERE THEY FIND THEMSELVES YEAR OVER YEAR AND TEMPORARY STATUS OFTEN. UNRELATED TO THEIR WORK PERFORMANCE WE THINK PARITY IN A PUSH PROBATIONARY PERIOD IS -- OFFERS THE STABILITY AND SECURITY THAT THESE EMPLOYEES. CAN RELY ON THEY ARE THE LOWEST PAID EMPLOYEES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND BUT IT'S SERVING A VERY IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS LIVES AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. VERY GOOD THANK YOUS WILL OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS DEREK LIMITS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REGRETTABLY WE MUST OPPOSE THE BILL -- WE EXPLAIN IN OUR LETTER THE REASONS THAT SIX MONTHS MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE REVIEW OF THE EMPLOYEES IN THE WAYS THAT IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT. EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYERS IN THOSE SITUATIONS THAT HAVE TO COME TO A RELATIVELY QUICKER DETERMINATION -- BUT THE POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE HERE AT THE DIS TODAY. IS THAT IF THE INTENT OF THE BILLS TO CLARIFY -- FOR EMPLOYEES WHETHER THEY ARE SIX MONTHS ARE SUBJECT TO A TWELVE MONTH PROBATIONARY PERIOD -- AS THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR HAVE STATED N THE PAST. THAT CHANGING EVERYBODY FROM TWELVE TO SIX DOES SEEM LIKE RATHER STRONG MEDICINE. MOST OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE A LIKE TO BE TWELVE MONTHS SOME NEGOTIATE DOWN TO SIX MONTHS AND THAT SEEMS APPROPRIATE SUBJECT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ONE DISTRICT THAT I SPOKE TO RATHER RECENTLY FROM NEVADA COUNTY IS A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THEY AND THEIR LOCAL UNION BOTH AGREED WE'RE ON SIX MONTHS WE WANT TO MOVE UP TO TWELVE BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S GONNA BE FAIR FOR THE EMPLOYEES AND OFFER THE EMPLOYER BETTER CHANCE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING. TO EMPLOYEES THAT NEED IT SO. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM IN OUR MIND WITH THE LOCAL OPTION TO DO THAT AND SWITCHING EVERYBODY OVER RATHER THAN SIMPLY PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION WHICH IS REQUIRED NOW -- WOULD SEEM LIKE AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION IF WE WANT TO CLARIFY FOR WORKERS WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE. IN THEIR LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR THANK YOU -- AIRBAG WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION OUT WE DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WHETHER SIX MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS AS OUR CONVERSATIONS WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- WHAT I DO WANNA AND WE REFERENCE IN OUR LETTER IS THAT THERE IS A? A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MERIT NOT MERIT DISTRICTS -- AYE AYE IF YOU LOOK AT THESE ARE THE STATUTES. COVERING MERIT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT'S TWENTY FIVE PAGES LONG IT CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THE REASON WHY YOU GO TO SIX MONTHS THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN A NON MERS SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A PERSONAL COMMISSION THAT STRICTLY FOCUSED ON OVERSEEING EVALUATING TESTING -- MERITS THAT COST FIVE EMPLOYEES AT AND YOU GO THROUGH A WITTY -- WIGGLING OUT OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS IN ADVANCE OF EVEN HIRING SO YOU'VE ALREADY KIND OF TAKING CARE OF SOME OF THE RISK IN ADVANCE OF EVEN HIRING. WHEN AT SIX MONTHS AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT LIKE TYPICAL TEACHERS AT START IN AUGUST AND WORK THROUGH A WHOLE CALENDAR SCHOOL YEAR? THEY MAY START IN MAY THEY MIGHT WORK MAY AND JUNE AND NOT WORK JULY AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER THAT SIX MONTHS START FROM THE DATE THE THING SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AND EVALUATE EMPLOYEE. SO THAT SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION BASED ON THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION IS A SIMPLE WAY WORTH KEEPING ON OR NOT. AND I THINK A SCHOOL DISTRICT RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE IT LABOR S. -- DISMISSAL PROCESS PROBABLY UP TO MAYBE DISMISSED THAT PERSON IF THEY DIDN'T SHOW IMMEDIATE -- GRASP OF THE ASSIGNMENT I DON'T KNOW THAT'S FAIRLY ANYBODY I'M NOT SURE IT'S FAIR TO SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S BEEN RE HIGHER AND GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. OR IS THAT A FAIR TO THE EMPLOYEE THEY THINK IF THEY WERE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY. SO WE JUST THINK THAT THE COUNTY YOUR CYCLE OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS NOT A TYPICAL TWELVE MONTH WORK ENVIRONMENT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE BASICALLY IN EIGHT MONTHS NINE MONTHS SCHOOL YEAR. AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS BEGIN PRODUCT INCINERATION COUPLED WITH THE IDEA THAT. THERE ARE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENTS THAT MAKE SIX MONTHS WORK FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE CHOSE TO GO THAT PATH I USED TO WORK FOR LOS ANGELES UNIFIED THEY HAVE IN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS TO WEED OUT GOOD APPLICANTS AND APPLICANTS BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN HIRED SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE OFFICE CAN'T. THAT DOESN'T EXIST WITHIN A NON MERIT SCHOOL BASIS AND TO SUGGEST THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE JUST SIX MONTHS AND TWELVE MONTHS WITHOUT THE EXTRA INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THIS DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD. FOR THAT WE WOULD OPPOSE. OTHERS POSITION YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND CENTER MORALE A JEFF BARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND I WOULD SIMPLY ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. MORE PRESSING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WERE ALSO IN OPPOSITION HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING SERRA BUT JUST WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. WAIT FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GREAT POWERS THAT THIRTIES WE'D ALSO LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT STUDENTS SAFE. FIRST PRIORITY AND HAVING JUST SIX MONTHS TO ASSESS THE CALIBRATING INDIVIDUAL WHO IS -- AROUND THESE CHILDREN IS NOT ENOUGH TIME. THANK YOU. SHALL CAST OF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL IN SORRY I'M OUT OF ORDER IT WAS OUT OF THE ROOM LOOKING UPWARD SUPPORT THE BILL. WE ACTUALLY -- BELIEVE IT SIX MONTHS IS ADEQUATE TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PERSON IS QUALIFIED. UNLIKE BUT THE PREVIOUS -- SPEAKER JUST SAID EMPLOYEES ARE SCREENED UPON HIRING ARE THEY SAFE THEY HAVE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS THEY HAD TO TAKE A COMPETENCY TEST WE THINK SIX MONTHS IS PLENTY OF TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY QUALIFIED TO DO THE JOB. WESLEY I DON'T YOU THINK YOU. SO IT'S REALLY GONNA HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ALSO APOLOGIES FOR BEING OUT OF ORDER WHERE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE PARDEE QUESTION NO QUESTION SAYS IT AYE AYE I THINK THE OPPOSITION MAKES A COUPLE OF GOOD POINTS I BE I DON'T KNOW IF IT. DOESN'T TIP THE SCALE FOR ME BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE MAY BE SOME. TRUMP STAFF THAT MADE. NOT BE RETAINED BECAUSE OF THE SIX MONTHS VERSUS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF THEY DO HAVE. WHAT'S LEFT -- OR IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY AFTER THAT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY MAY JUST LET THEM GO TO NOT TAKE THE CHANCE BUT I'M ASSUMING AND JUST AS WAS MENTIONED. THE VETTING THE GOES INTO ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE IN THAT CATEGORY IS. IS STRONG AND AND OBVIOUSLY -- THINK COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORK SO IDEA. OF WE I WILL MOVE THE BILL. AND WE WILL OF HAVE THE VOTE. SORRY. I'LL MOVE THE BILL AND THIS IS TO DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE FLOOR. SO OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR HILL AYE HILL AYE MORRELL. WORLDNOW JACKSON. MITCHELL PAN.

PLEASE PROCEED I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN DIVIDES PUBLIC WORKS TO INCLUDE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY PROJECTS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING THROUGH CONDUIT REVENUE BONDS. THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK ON THESE PROJECTS RECEIVE PREVAILING WAGE AND ALLOW THEM TO BENEFIT. FROM A FRIENDSHIP PROGRAMS WHICH WE KNOW ARE VERY VALUABLE. CONDUIT REVENUE BOND IS FINANCING COORDINATED BY A NON PROFIT OR PUBLIC ENTITY SUCH AS A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY UNDER THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. THE STATE LOSES REVENUE ON THESE BONDS AS INVESTORS DO NOT PAY TAXES. INTERN THE BORROWER BENEFITS BY RECEIVING LOWER INTEREST RATES. UNDER EXISTING LAW CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES THAT ARE FUNDED BY STATE EDUCATION BONDS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE PREVAILING WAGE AND HIGHER CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS UNDER THE FIELD ACT. PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH CONDO BONDS HOWEVER DO NOT HAVE TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE WE MUST ENSURE THAT THAT THE THAT THOSE WORKING ON THE STATE SUBSIDIZED PROJECTS ARE SKILLED AND QUALIFIED. THIS IS A POLICY THAT KEEPS GIVING A FIRM BELIEVER IN THIS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS MIDDLE pIMPACT ON ECONOMY IT'S THE POLICY. IT KEEPS GIVING. HERE IN SUPPORT IS -- JEREMY -- FROM THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION -- COUNCIL TRAITS. THANK YOU FOR CHAIR MORNING MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH YOUR BEHALF OF THE SERVICE REP ANSWERS LAST NAME CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF MINISTERS YEAH. YES WE KNOW THAT LEGEND COMING SAYS ARE -- I WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM THAT WOULD ONLY. WE ARE HERE -- THE PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL LAID OUT HOW CONDUIT REVENUE FINANCING WORKS. I WILL GO INTO THAT ANYMORE I WILL WILL SIMPLY SAY THAT OF REQUIRING THE PREVAILING WAGE ON THESE PROJECTS. LEADS TO AYE THE USE OF A HIGHLY MORE HIGHLY SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE BECAUSE CONTRACTORS TO BID ON THESE PROJECTS. ARE GOING TO UTILIZE THAT TYPE OF COURSE THIS LEADS TO BETTER BUILT SCHOOLS SAFER SCHOOLS SCHOOLS BILL ON TIME ON BUDGET -- AND THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS GOES INTO PAYING THE PREVAILING WAGE SHOULD FACTOR INTO THE FAX THAT -- THAT LEAD HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS LEAD TO BETTER PROJECTS SO WERE AND STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL -- DRIVE OF THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY BERNACCHI ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE OF THE PLUMBING HEATING PIPING INDUSTRY. UNITED CONTRACTORS THE WESTERN WALL CEILING ALLIANCE. AND THE THAT NO THE CALIFORNIA ALLIED TRADES -- IN STRONG SUPPORT THE MEASURE AND WE WANT THINK THE AUTHOR FOR PUSHING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU. SEPTEMBER HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THOSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FOR MORNING. THIS CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF THE MOST. CHALLENGING THINGS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE CONTINUOUSLY IS ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FACILITIES. AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT -- FUNDING MECHANISM FOR US -- TO ACCESS THESE ADEQUATE FACILITIES I THINK -- THE CONSEQUENCE OF OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT'S GOING TO INCREASE COSTS -- AND ULTIMATELY LEADER CHARTER SCHOOLS TO NOT USE THE CONDO. REVENUE BOND FINANCING SYSTEM ANYMORE AND MOVED TO THE PRIVATE MARKET -- AND IF THEY DO NEED TO INCREASE THEIR COSTS IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THEIR GENERAL OB -- OPERATING BUDGET WHICH IS DIRECTLY OUT OF THE CLASSROOM AND OUT OF OUR TEACHERS HANDS -- I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT PREVAILING WAGE AND AND CHARTER SCHOOL -- CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT IT SHOULD BE A BROADER CONVERSATION -- TO WHERE WE CAN INCREASE ACCESS A LOT OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTY ACCESSING LOCAL BONDS -- AND DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO ACCESS STATE BONDS I THINK IF WE CAN HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT ACCESS TO THOSE TO THOSE FUNDS THAN -- WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT THIS BILL APPLYING THIS TO A CONDO REVENUE BOND FINANCING MECHANISM THAT IS A VERY -- THERE IS A A VERY UNIQUE AND EASIER WAY TO LOWER OUR INTEREST RATES AND INCREASE OUR ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FACILITIES I THINK IS A GOOD THING AND SO WE ARE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. NO ONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A IT'S OF GREAT BUILDS FAIR. OF ME WE DO USE THIS RIGHT NOW. FOR ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS AND ELSEWHERE WHERE THERE ARE IS CONDUIT FINANCING. THAT THE PREVAILING WAGE WOULD APPLY AND I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT WE DO IN THIS CASE I THINK IT.
