MASTER PLAN FOR THE VETERANS HOMES WHICH WAS THEN. IN ITS INFANCY I SAID THEN. TO THE THEN -- CALVET SECRETARY -- DOCTOR BOSS CHIANTI. THAT HE HAD PROVIDED WELCOME DIRECTION LEADERSHIP AT THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS AN ERROR OF GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND COOPERATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S AS TRUE. TODAY AS IT WAS THEN. IT'S ALSO A YEAR LATER HOWEVER AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO IT WOULD BE GREAT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCRETE IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAL THAT HAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LAST YEAR. AS WELL AS SHARE WITH US WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT RECENT PROGRESS ON THE MASTER PLAN WHICH IS DUE IN FEBRUARY. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NEW MEMBERS AND THEY ARE NOT HERE YET BUT SAID I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE SECRETARY ABBAS YANNI AS A PHYSICIAN SURGEON. AND A VETERAN HIMSELF -- HE SERVED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS IN THE US ARMY IN THE MARINE CORPS IN THE MEDICAL CORPS. AND HE RETIRED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AT THE RANK HAS BEEN THE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT BY GOVERNOR BROWN IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WHY DON'T WE CALL YOU UP RIGHT NOW AND WILL START WITH AN OVERVIEW OF CALVET AND I THINK WE ARE. SCHEDULED TO FINISH AT FOUR O'CLOCK A LOT OF MEMBERS HAVE TRAINING SO -- WE'LL JUST KEEP. R. I. ON THE CLOCK WELCOME GALGIANI. NEW MADAM CHAIR KING THEM. I THANK YOU ALL OF YOU THOSE RETURNING AND NEW FOR ALL THAT YOU DO TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS. I'VE COURSE -- LOVE BEING HERE TODAY WITH YOU TODAY AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ALL. ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF CAL THAT THUS FAR. AND TO JUST START OUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT GOING FORWARD. IT IS THE START OF A NEW CHAPTER IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A NEW YEAR A NEW GOVERNOR A NEW BIENNIAL LEGISLATIVE. SESSION. AND AS WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE WITH WHAT I KNOW IS A SHARED GOAL OF MAINTAINING SERVICES OF THE HIGHEST ORDER. TO OUR STATES VETERANS AND SETTING THE PACE FOR THE NATION IN DOING SO. I CANNOT HELP BUT BE STRUCK FAR WE HAVE COME. AND HOW WHAT I SEE TODAY CONTRAST WITH WHAT I FOUND WHEN I WAS FIRST APPOINTED IN LATE. TWENTY FIFTEEN MY INTENTION TODAY IS TO UPDATE YOU ALL ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DEPARTMENT AND WHERE I'D LIKE TO GO FROM HERE. BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT I HAVE TO START BY EXPLAINING WHERE WE WERE JUST SEVERAL YEARS AGO. HOW WE ARRIVE WHERE WE ARE TODAY PARDON ME. WHEN I BEGAN MY TENURE CALVET WAS IN NEED OF TRANSFORMATION? THE AGENCY HAD BEEN WEAKENED BY LEADERSHIP TURN OVER AND WAS SEARCHING FOR A CLEAR IDENTITY AND CULTURE. AT THE SAME TIME MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS WERE EXPERIENCING GREAT% EXPANSION IN THEIR SCOPE WE WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A NEW CEMETERY IN MONTEREY. OPEN THE LAST OF FIVE NEW VETERANS HOMES AND WE WERE ABOUT TO START THE VETERANS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH I WILL REFER TO GOING FORWARD AS V. H. H. P.. AT THAT SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO FACED WITH MANY CHALLENGES. ESPECIALLY IN THE EIGHT VETERANS HOMES. MEETING THOSE CHALLENGES. ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR HELP AND INSTRUCTION REQUIRED THOUGHTFUL AND STRICT PRIORITIZATION. FOR US SAID CAL THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY AT THE TIME WAS TO OPEN AND STAFF. THE NEW VETERANS HOMES IN FRESNO READING AND WEST LOS ANGELES. AND AS WE DID THAT I SAW THAT WHILE MOST OF THE HOMES PROVIDED SAFE QUALITY CARE. THEY WERE NOT THE EXCELLENT MODELS OF CLINICAL CARE THAT I EXPECTED AND THAT THEY ARE TODAY. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE EIGHT HOMES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STATE WERE STANDALONE ENTITIES. THEY LACK THE COHESION AND DEFICIENCIES OF A MODERN HEALTH CARE NETWORK. MANY OF THE HOMES WERE STRUGGLING WITH LOWER STAR RATINGS FROM THE US CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. AND THEY WERE OPERATING WITH DISPARATE PROCESS SEES OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY. FOR THESE REASONS MY EXECUTIVE TEAM AND I ESTABLISH PRIORITIES FOR THE HOMES. IN THE AREAS OF QUALITY OF CARE AND STANDARDIZATION OF OPERATIONS AMONG MANY OTHERS. AND AS A RESULT OUR PERFORMANCE IN MANY AREAS HAS GONE FROM MERELY ADEQUATE TO OUTSTANDING AND THE PROOF IS IN OUR OUTCOMES SO LET ME NAME A FEW. TODAY. ALL FIVE OF OUR CMS RATED VETERANS HOMES ARE RATED AT FOUR OR FIVE STARS. PUTTING THEM AMONG THE TOP SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES NATIONWIDE. A DRAMATIC CHANGE FROM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN ALL HOMES WERE AT ONLY TWO STARS. AND ALL FIVE ARE NOW ALSO RANKED AMONG THE TOP ONE HUNDRED BEST NURSING HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. BY US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT THIS LAST NOVEMBER. ALL EIGHT OF OUR HOMES CONSISTENTLY EXCEL IN THE ANNUAL LICENSING SURVEYS WITH HIGH MARKS AND OFTEN FLAWLESS RESULTS. I HAVE TO ADMIT THESE ACCOLADES ARE TO THE CREDIT OF OUR TEAM OF HOME ADMINISTRATORS WHO BRING TO THEIR JOBS AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS EACH. OF HEALTH CARE. EXPERIENCE. ADDITIONALLY WE'VE ADOPTED TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE PATIENT SAFETY EFFICIENCY AND TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES OVERALL WE HAVE GROWN OUR TELEMEDICINE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL VA WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY LAUNCHING. AN AUTOMATED PHARMACEUTICAL PROBLEM PROGRAM IN ALL HOMES WITH SKILL PROGRAMS SKILLED NURSING -- LEVELS OF CARE. AS OF LAST DECEMBER FOR THE FIRST TIME VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN NOW SUBMIT APPLICATIONS. TO OUR HOMES. THROUGH AN ONLINE PORTAL AND USE THAT PORTAL TO CHECK THEIR PLACE ON OUR ADMISSIONS WAITING LISTS. WE HAVE OPENED HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL SKILLED NURSING BEDS. ARE WEST LOS ANGELES HOME NOW IS AUTHORIZED TO HOUSE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED RESIDENTS AND IS ON TRACK SOON TO BE COMPLETELY FULL. WITH RESPECT TO OUR PROPOSED NEW SKILLED NURSING FACILITY ON THE YOUNG FILL CAMPUS. WE HAVE BEGUN DETERMINING THE SITE DETAILS AND THE PATH FORWARD FOLLOWING LAST YEAR'S RELATED BUDGET BUDGET ALLOCATION. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THE HOMES. I AM PLEASED TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE JUST THIS MONTH. ENTERED THE FINAL PHASE OF THE STATE'S IT PROCUREMENT PROCESS TO LAUNCH A NEW ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM FOR ALL OF OUR VETERANS HOMES. LATER THIS YEAR. BUT MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE. IN OUR STANDARDIZATION OF CARE IN THE HOMES ONE AREA OF IMPROVEMENT I AM CURRENTLY ADDRESSING. IS HOW WE ENGAGE IN LEASES LICENSES AND OTHER PARTNERSHIPS IN OUR VETERANS HOME PROPERTIES INCLUDING THE MUCH DISCUSSED YON PHIL HOME. I HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN A CRITICAL STEP TO ENSURE THAT OUR LEASE ARRANGEMENTS ARE MADE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE. OF OUR VETERAN HOME SYSTEM AND MORE THE VETERANS WHO LIVE IN THOSE HOMES. I HAVE ISSUED A DIRECTIVE TO COMPLETELY OVERHAUL OUR LEASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND OUR PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS THAT ALL AGREEMENTS. MUST SUPPORT BOTH THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE AND OF OUR RESIDENT VETERANS. A COPY OF THIS POLICIES BEEN PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE AND AS WE IMPLEMENT -- THIS IMPROVED POLICY YOU WILL CAN WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU. REGARDING HOW BEST TO UTILIZE THE ON FILL CAMPUS TO ITS MAXIMUM POTENTIAL. BECAUSE OF THE WORK WITH CURRENTLY DOING AND THE MILESTONES WE'VE ACHIEVED THE CURRENT STATE OF VETERANS HOMES I CAN REPORT. IS NOW DISTINGUISHED BY COMPASSIONATE CARE. HI PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. SO NOW YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHAT WILL OUR HOMES LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT THIS QUESTION IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF MY THINKING AND SOMETHING I AM COMMITTED TO DEFINING. CALIFORNIA'S VETERAN POPULATION IS CHANGING. AS OUR VETERANS CONTINUE TO AGE INTO LONG TERM CARE. WE MUST BE COGNIZANT THAT THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF OUR CURRENT RESIDENTS. WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR TWO THE KOREAN WAR AND EVEN THE VETERAN THE VIETNAM WAR? OUR TEAM HAS UNDERTAKEN AN INDEPTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT WILL DRIVE PLANNING FOR OUR HOMES FOR DECADES TO COME. THIS ASSESSMENT. THE FINDINGS WE DERIVE FROM IT. AND THE FIRST PHASE OF FUTURE PLANNING WILL BE COMPLETE BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR AT WHICH TIME BY YOUR REQUEST. WE WILL PROVIDE OUR FINAL REPORT TO YOU. I LOOK FORWARD TO USING THIS VALUABLE TOOL TO TAKE OUR HOMES INTO THE NEXT CHAPTER. OF HOW CALIFORNIA MEETS VETERANS NEEDS. THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL ALSO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MASTER PLAN FOR EACH OF OUR HOMES THE VETERANS HOMES OF CALIFORNIA FULFILL THE IMPORTANT PROMISE MADE BY THE STATE TO CARE FOR OUR AGED AND DISABLED VETERANS. AND IT IS MY SOLEMN COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY FULFILL THIS PROMISE BUT THAT WE DO SO WITH EXCELLENCE. HOWEVER. IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME TO DESIGN A PLAN FOR LOCATING THE VETERANS HOMES. THE MAP WOULD LOOK QUITE DIFFERENT THAN IT. IN THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS I WOULD HAVE YOU SPECIFIC CRITERIA TO EVALUATE AND PRIORITIZE WHERE TO BUILD THOSE HOMES. AND WHAT LEVELS OF CARE TO PROVIDE IN THEM. AND THE CRITERIA WOULD ALL BE BASED ON PROXIMITY. SIMILARLY TO A VA HOSPITAL MEDICAL FACILITY PROXIMITY TO A HIGH POPULATION OF VETERANS. AND PROXIMITY TO ALL ROBUST TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. OTHER CRITERIA WOULD HAVE INCLUDED BUILDING IN AREAS WITH A REASONABLE COST OF LIVING FOR EMPLOYEES. AND A LARGE EMPLOYEE REGISTRY OF AVAILABLE BACK FILL WORKERS. SO SINCE WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE HOMES THAT DIVERGED GREATLY FROM ALL OF THOSE CRITERIA. BUT WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN PART DUE TO A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO CONDUCT A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AND A MASTER PLAN THAT WILL FOSTER POLICY DISCUSSION AND DECISIONS AND MY HOPE IS THAT AS WE FORMULATE A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE YOU WILL ALL BE PARTNERS WITH ME. IN HELPING US TO ACCOMPLISH THESE CHANGES SO THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST WE PUT THE NEEDS OF OUR CURRENT RESIDENCE AS WELL AS THOSE OF FUTURE. GENERATIONS OF VETERANS ABOVE ALL ELSE. SO I SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT OUR VETERANS HOMES IN PART BECAUSE THEY MAKE UP NEARLY 80% OF MY BUDGET AND 90% OF MY WORK FORCE. AND BECAUSE I NEEDED TO PRIORITIZE THEIR IMPROVEMENT WHEN I CAME TO CAL THAT. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO ENSURE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND FUTURE PLANS. FOR THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT SERVE VETERANS. LET'S START AS A RESULT OF THE VOTER APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE BOND MEASURE AND NO. YES MA'AM. OF TO INTERRUPT RIGHT NOW BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A A LIST OF PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH DO YOU MIND IF. ANYBODY HAS QUESTIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE DONE WITH THE HOMES RIGHT NOW RIGHT EFFECTIVELY OKAY RIGHT. AND I THINK THAT MAYBE INSTEAD OF WAITING ALL THE WAY TILL THE END DOES ANYBODY HAVE. QUESTIONS ON THE HOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER VOEPEL MR DIRECTOR [inaudible] GREAT JOB. QUESTION ON YON PHIL. BUILT IN -- EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR HOW MANY ACRES IS IT ON I DON'T HOLD ME TO THE EXACT NUMBER BUT IN EXCESS OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY JUST NORTH OF NAPA VALLEY CORRECT. IT IT'S IN THE HEART OF NAPA COUNTY IN THAT WINE PRODUCING AREA. HOME IS SURROUNDED BY VINEYARDS WHOSE NAMES YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH HOW FAR AWAY IS YON PHIL FROM THE NEAREST VA -- HOSPITAL. A LONG DRIVE. VETERANS A RESIDENTS OF OUR HOME NOT JUST IN NOW FILLED BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE READING IS SHASTA COUNTY. THE VETERANS AND THEIR ALSO WHEN THEY NEED A CUTE MEDICAL CARE PROVIDED ONLY BY THE FEDERAL Vl THEY MUST BOARD TRANSPORTATION. TO GO EITHER TO PALO ALTO FOR MILEY IN THE HEART OF SAN FRANCISCO MARTINEZ OR HEARING MADE HER SACRAMENTO. WHAT WOULD BE THE AVERAGE TIME FOR THOSE -- I THINK THE QUICKEST TURNAROUND IS PROBABLY FOUR HOURS AND THAT'S JUST FOR A SIMPLE BLOOD CHECKED HER BLOOD PRESSURE. NOW CHAT SO IF A VETERAN HAS A HEART ATTACK WHERE DO THEY GO -- TO WE'RE CONTRACTED -- WITH LOCAL HOT ALI I THINK IS THE PRIMARY HOSPITAL IN NAPA VALLEY [inaudible] SO. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE YON PHIL CORRECT WE'VE ALREADY IF I MAY BRAG A LITTLE BIT WE'VE REACHED THE 90% MARK OF SUCESS WITH THE FEDERAL VA. WE'VE BEEN APPROVED TO PUT IN A THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. REPLACEMENT FACILITY -- TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR YON PHIL BUT WE COULD DISCUSS -- TO REPLACE. THREE BUILDINGS PRESENTLY USED HALDEMAN EISENHOWER AND ROOSEVELT PRESENTLY HOUSING ARE INTERMEDIATE CARE ARE SKILLED NURSING CARE AND OUR MEMORY CARE. POPULATION. THESE ARE IN BUILDINGS THE LATTER TWO RECENTLY RENOVATED ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO BUT THESE WERE BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT AROUND THE TIME -- OFFER A HARBOR [inaudible] VERY WELL. THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR. SO THROUGH THE CHAIR MAY I ASK A DIRECT QUESTION. FINALLY THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. I'M NOT ASKING FOR A RECOMMENDATION BUT COULD YOU PUT INTO YOUR MIX OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON WHAT IF YON PHIL WAS DOWN SCALED. DOWN WE USE THAT. SIX HUNDRED PLUS ACRES OF INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE REAL ESTATE. HALL [inaudible] FOR FINANCING. OTHER FACILITIES IN. OTHER GEOGRAPHIC POSITIONS CLOSER TO THE VA AND ALL THE CRITERIA YOU SAID THAT IF. IT WAS A PERFECT WORLD YOU COULD SATISFY RIGHT [inaudible] CHAU. YOU HAVE -- TO YES YES YES AND YES OKAY OKAY TO START WITH THAT BUT THE WORLD I WORK IN FIRST ON DEALING WITH. THE LARGEST. VETERANS HOME IN THE NATION THE MOST POPULOUS NURSING HOME OF ANY KIND MILITARY OR CIVILIAN IN THE NATION BY A FACTOR OF THREE AND THE OLDEST VETERANS CEMETERY THERE ARE PEOPLE INTERRED AT YON PHIL WHO FOUGHT IN THE CIVIL WAR AND EVEN AT THE ALAMO. A THESE OF THE MEXICAN AMERICAN WAR. IT'S HELLO GRAND AND GROUND ITS THE OLDEST NURSING HOME IN THE COUNTRY EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A A SMALL HOME IN MAINE. IN ORDER NO MAIN THAT CLAIMS -- PRIMACY OF PLACE. BUT IT'S IT'S BECOME OVER THE DECADES CENTURY. IF YOU WILL A VERY INTIMATE PART OF THE CULTURE OF NAPA COUNTY -- AND WE'RE GONNA WIND UP TALKING ABOUT ISSUES I THINK AFTER NEXT WEEK WHEN THE STATE WATER OF A COMES OUT WITH A REPORT ON CAL THAT'S HANDLING IN THE PAST OF LEASES. LEASING OUT OVER THE DECADES OF ASPECTS OF THAT PROPERTY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY SOME MAY SAY TO THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY -- AND NOT TO THE THESE LEASES DO NOT READ DOWN TO NECESSARILY TO THE BENEFIT OF THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE THERE -- HERE RIGHT. IT -- COULD WE TALK ABOUT. SKILL I I THINK THAT WHEN THIS WATER COMES OUT THAT WILL BE THE FIRST QUESTION IN PEOPLE'S MINDS IS HOW BETTER TO USE THAT CAMPUS. DO I THINK THAT. I SEE POLITICALLY AND I THINK THAT POLITICALLY WE CAN. CONSIDER ABANDONING THAT PROPERTY ALL TOGETHER. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TO USE A WORLD WAR TWO EXPRESSION A BRIDGE TOO FAR FOR ME. BUT IN MANY WAYS IT WOULD MAKE LOGICAL AND FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL SENSE. TO PUT A NEW FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. ACROSS THE STREET FROM MAY THIRD -- A VETERANS HOSPITAL RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IT MEETS ALL THE CRITERIA. PROXIMITY TO A FEDERAL VA GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE HIGH DENSITY OF VETERAN POPULATION PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. MY EMPLOYEES CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE YOUNG FILL CAMPUS OR THE WEST LA CAMPUS IT'S HARD TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT EMPLOYEES -- SO YOU ASH THE THE SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION. OF MISTER GLORIA HAD A QUESTION. HELLO SIMPLISTIC THIS SECTOR I COULD SEE YOU -- JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HOMES THEMSELVES FOR STUFF. AND HAD FORGIVE ME IF YOU COVER THIS IN YOUR INITIAL COMMENTS BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO GET HERE. CURRENT SECURITY SITUATION AT YON PHIL WHAT SORT OF HAPPENED LAST YEAR -- TO INCREASE OR IMPROVE SECURITY AT THAT LOCATION SURE -- KEEPING IN MIND THAT THIS IS AN OPEN CAMPUS AND THIS IS A HOME A HOME IT'S OUR OUR RESIDENT FED AS WITH THAT PEOPLE ARE WARDS OF THE STATE THESE ARE FREE CITIZENS. AND SO IT'S AN OPEN CAMPUS MAYBE EVEN MORE OPEN IF I CAN BY REFERRING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOCALS A REFERENCES. TO THE FACT THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY COME ON TO USE THE SWIMMING POOL THE BASEBALL FIELD THE NAPA COUNTY MUSEUM THE THEATER AND I'M JUST. TOUCHING THE SURFACE. SO BUT WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF WHAT HAPPENED -- THANKS. TO UP. THE WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE OF OUR LESS SEIZE ON THE PROPERTY -- SO THAT I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT THE PATHWAYS UP HOME PROGRAM -- DISBANDED WITHIN A MONTH AND WE CAME TO A MUTUAL AFTER THAT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE ASKED THE AND THE CA A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. HAS NOW GRACES THE CAMPUSWITH A PERMANENT PRESENCE OKAY WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE THAT BEFORE. OKAY SO AND THEY THEY ARE FREE TO USE THE DINING HALL AND IT GRATIFY IS THE RESIDENTS TO KNOW WHEN TO SEE UNIFORMS CH P. PEOPLE -- HAVING A CUP OF TEA OR COFFEE WITH THE SO. I I CANNOT TURN THE YON PHIL VETERANS THAT THE VETERANS HOME CALIFORNIA DOWN FULL CANNOT BECOME A FORTRESS. I GET THAT AND IT'S THE BALANCE OF HOW DO YOU. NOT HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAVE EVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN THIS OF THE STUFF LEGISLATURE COULD HELP WITH -- HOWEVER MAKING SURE PROBABLY RESOURCE TO PROTECT THE THAT INTO THE VERY IS IMPORTANT TO ME -- ON THE ON PAGE. OF SORRY SON NUMBERED -- DOES THE CHART SHOWING IN FACILITIES BEDS CAPACITY BUDGET BEDS THERE'S A DELTA BETWEEN BAD CAPACITY IN BUDGET BEDS OF FIVE HUNDRED IS THERE A WHAT IF. BEYOND US NOT GIVING ENOUGH MONEY -- IS THERE A REASON WHY THIS FIVE HUNDRED BEDS ARE NOT OCCUPIED. ELSEWHERE BUT I'M NOT SURE PAGE AGAIN AND SAY THIS IS THE CHART -- THE BEDS IN THE CAPACITIES IT'S ALL RIGHT -- AND THERE'S THE FIVE HUNDRED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF CAPACITY BEDS VERSES BUDGET BEDS OKAY BECAUSE I I DIDN'T HAVE THIS INTO THE I'M SORRY -- MY DEPUTY SECRETARY KOBE -- COLBY PETERSON COULD PROBABLY GIVE YOU A GOOD ANSWER FOR THIS. A GOOD A GOOD AFTERNOON KOBE PETERSON W. SECTOR VETERANS HOMES -- SO -- WHAT? WE WERE LOOKING AT THE CHART THIS WHEN WE GOT HERE AS WELL I THINK OF A NUMBER OF THESE. THE THE STAFF NEEDS TO BE UPDATED OKAY -- THERE IS JUST THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAPACITY AND BETWEEN -- BUDGETED BEDS -- ESSENTIALLY THERE'S A NUMBER OF BEDS THROUGHOUT. ALL EIGHT EIGHT VETERANS HOMES THAT ARE NOT FILLED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE WE DON'T STAFF -- TO FILL IN THERE WASN'T THE NEED FOR THE FOR THE WAITING LIST FOR THOSE AREAS WE GET A NUMBER BEDS IN BARSTOW THAT HAVE NOT BEEN. BILL THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A BIT THERE'S SEVENTY FIVE BEDS AND AND YON PHIL. IN IN ONE OF OUR BUILDINGS THAT HAS NOT BEEN FILLED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DEMAND TO FILL IT. SO THERE'S A THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT WE TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE BUDGET BASED UPON THE NEED -- AS MUCH AS WE CAN -- WHAT WE WILL DO A LOOK AT THAT CHART AND WE'LL UPDATE IT -- AND HAVE THAT TO YOU FOR THIS WEEK AND I'M WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS A CURIOSITY OF HOW MUCH IT IS ME AS A LEGISLATOR NOT APPROPRIATE IN THE FUNDS TO MAKE THOSE FULLY UTILIZED. ALWAYS A BLENDOF LACK OF MARKET DEMAND COUPLE WITH MAYBE SOME RENOVATIONS WITH BEDS ARE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT -- HILL WAS UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT FIVE HUNDRED IS AS YOU IMAGINE COMING FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S ANYWAY COUNTY WHERE TO MY UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE A WAITING LIST TO GET IN. A TO THE CHáVEZ TO HOME. ANY ANY INDICATION OF NOT FULL UTILIZATION JUST STRUCK ME AS ODD BUT YOU'VE ALREADY EDUCATED ME THAT FOSTERS MAY BE DIFFERENT ANGELES. TO AT THIS SITE ACT IS A PARTIAL ANSWER LET ME ADD AND AND ESPECIALLY IN PREPARATION FOR ARE AND WEEK WE ALREADY HAVING CLEANS OF WHAT THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS GOING TO DO. PARTICULAR IN YOUR AREA AND YOURS MADAM CHAIR AND AND THE VENTURA HOME -- THE PRESSURE BUILDING FOR HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE THAN WE PRESENTLY PROVIDE THERE IN YOUR AREA PARTICULARLY FROM MEMORY CARE. SO -- IT'S NOT SO MUCH AN EMPTY BED IT'S WHO'S IN THAT BAD SURE AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT MIX -- WE DO HAVE SOME SOLUTIONS FOR EXAMPLE FROM SKILLED NURSING TO MEMORY KERR CHULA VISTA IT WOULD INVOLVE -- PREVENTING ELOPEMENT BY BUILDING BUILDING A SIMPLE -- GARDEN WALL. BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT WELL IN THE MATCH I KNOW I'VE GONE TAKING TOO MUCH TIME BUT I APPRECIATE -- KNOWING MORE ABOUT THAT AGAIN HOW MUCH OF ITS APPROPRIATIONS QUESTION IF WE'RE PROPERLY RESOURCING YOU. CARE FOR FOLKS -- IT IS A TOP CONCERN IN SAN DIEGO -- AND WILL LOOK FOR THAT TO THE AUDIT COMING BACK AS WELL AS WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE WHEN YOU WERE LIKE HEY WE THINKING A MOMENT AGO. BASED ON ALL THOSE VERY FACTORS WHERE YOU THINK THINGS SHOULD BE -- YOU KNOW I'VE CARE PARDON ME FOR BEING PART OF THE SAN DIEGO BUT IF IF YOU IDENTIFY TO YOUR WISDOM AND YOUR STAFFS -- INPUT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE HOMES AND COMMUNITIES X. Y. Z. I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT JUST BEFORE BASIS [inaudible] THE MANAGER. CERTAINLY OPEN ANOTHER. HI AT THINGS FOR BEING HERE. JUST CIRCLING BACK QUICKLY TO THE YOUNG FELL CONVERSATION SO YOU MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF RELOCATING SOME OF THAT CAPACITY TO YOU PERHAPS HAVE ANOTHER LOCATION IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE EXPLORING. FORMALLY OR BUT I KNOW I THINK AT WHAT I SAID HERE TODAY IS ABOUT AS FAR AS I'VE GONE OKAY FAR OKAY TO BE HONEST. RIGHT -- THE THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT VIA FROM THE INTENDED PLANT THAT BUILDING RIGHT THERE ON AVAILABLE CAMPUS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK IS WORTH EXPLORING FORMALLY. WELL -- AS MR VOCAL -- POINTED OUT -- IT'S SO DIFFICULT FOR US WHEN PEOPLE NEED -- ALMOST ANYTHING THAT THE FEDS PROVIDE TO GET THEM THERE. THEY'RE JUST NOT. A SUMMER HOMES ARE NOT IN THE BEST LOCATION. FOR THAT CARE. SO I THINK WELL WE CAN LOOK WHEN THE WATER COMES OUT AND AS WE PROGRESS OF COURSE. IF IF WE WERE TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY I'D PROBABLY LOSE A YEAR AND AND HAVING TO REDO SOME ASSESSMENTS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. RIGHT WHY DON'T WE MOVE FORWARD THEN WITH THE FARMING HOME LOAN PROGRAM. THANKS THANK YOU. SO THE OTHER PROGRAMS AS SURVEILLANCE I STARTED TO MENTION THAT THE NOVEMBER BALLOT AND THE VOTERS -- AGAIN -- APPROVED A ONE BILLION DOLLAR BOND AUTHORITY HAVE ALL ALLOW OUR FARM AND HOME LOAN PROGRAM. TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HOME LOANS TO VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR A FEW MORE YEARS. YOU SHOULD KNOW ESPECIALLY THE NEW MEMBERS. SINCE. NINETEEN TWENTY ONE AFTER TWENTY SEVEN SUCCESSFUL CONSECUTIVE TRIPS TO THE BALLOT. THE PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED HOME LOANS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIA VETERANS. IT'S ALMOST A HALF MILLION VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA GOT THEIR HOME LOANS FROM OUR PROGRAM. AND THE VOTERS HAVE APPROVED IT TWENTY SEVEN TIMES IN A ROW WITHOUT FAIL. IN OCTOBER. TWENTY SIXTEEN CALVET OPEN TO THE CENTRAL COAST VETERANS CEMETERY IN MONTEREY. THE CEMETERY CURRENTLY HAS A PAST CITY CAPACITY FOR FIVE THOUSAND COLUMN BERIA AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PLANNING PHASE OF A PLATE PLANNING PORTION OF PHASE. TWO OF THE CEMETERY WHICH WILL DEVELOP THE PROPERTY FURTHER TO ACCEPT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY ONE IN GROUND BURIALS. WE CONTINUE TO BUILD UP OUR TWO SEPARATE DIVISIONS FOR WOMEN AND MINORITY VETERANS. THIS YEAR EACH DIVISION WILL EXPAND ON THE IMPORTANT WORK THEY DO. TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO IMMIGRATION SERVICES. TO EXPAND OUR REACH TO TRIBAL LANDS TO CREATE NEW OBJECTIVES FOR D. V. BE EASE THE DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM. AND TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR WOMEN VETERANS WHO FILE FOR BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION. OUR CALIFORNIA STATE STATE APPROVING AGENCY [inaudible] SEE SAVE. FOR VETERANS EDUCATION CONTINUES TO ACT AS A NATIONAL MODEL IN THE APPROVAL AND OVERSIGHT OF THE NEARLY ELEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS WHICH SEEK TO OFFER GI BILL AND EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS. TO TO VETERANS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. WE HAVE CALVET TAKE OUR ROLE OF OVERSIGHT VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ASSIDUOUSLY TO ENSURE THAT VETERANS RECEIVE THE VEST BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATION. FOR THE BENEFIT THEY GET. CALIFORNIA HAS IMPLEMENTED TO FIRST IN THE NATION PROGRAMS FOR VETERANS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE FIRST OF THESE IS VH PRETTY VETERANS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION PROGRAM. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY COLLEGE A FAKE. CAL THAT'S B. H. H. P. PROGRAM HAS TO DATE AWARDED OVER THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO DEVELOP MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING FOR VETERANS. THIS TRANSLATES INTO MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS. AS A FUNDING SOURCE THE V. H. H. P. PROGRAM ALSO BRINGS IN NINE DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL OUTSIDE FUNDING FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR OF H. H. P. P. FUND. THE H. H. P. FUNDING THAT WE PROVIDE. AS OF TODAY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR VETERAN HOUSEHOLDS ARE HOUSED OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING HOUSED. AND MANY MORE WILL BE HOUSED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL MORE ROUNDS OF FUNDING TO AWARD WITH THE REMAINING MONIES AVAILABLE TO ME. THIS PROGRAM IS BUILDING THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR VETERANS AND ACTING AS A FUNDING MULTIPLIER FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR NON VETERANS. MY DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE PRIORITIZING HOUSING FOR VETERANS AND IS LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE. THE OTHER FIRST IN THE NATION PROGRAM DEVELOPED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. IS THE CALIFORNIA TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR CAL TAP. THIS PROVIDES CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO SEPARATING SERVICE MEMBERS. THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM ARE. TO INFORM AND CONNECT VETERANS OF ALL THE EARNED FEDERAL AND STATE BENEFITS. TO COORDINATE WITH COMMUNITY PROVIDERS IN THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES. AND TO SUPPORT VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES SAYS THEIR NEEDS CHANGE OVER TIME. WE LAUNCHED CAL TAP IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE GROWTH IN DEMAND OF THE PROGRAM IS STAGGERING. SINCE THEN CAL TAP HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE TRANSITION PROGRAMS OF EVERY MAJOR MILITARY INSTALLATION IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S MORE THAN. TWENTY TWO TO DATE CAL TAP HAS TOUCHED OVER FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY VETERANS AND ACTRESS ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS. INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. THE PROGRAM WILL ADD EIGHT ADDITIONAL STAFF SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. CAL TOPPLE ALSO DEPLOY AN EXPANDED ONLINE KID CURRICULUM LATER THIS YEAR. THAT WILL ALLOW VETERANS OF ANY YEAR OF SERVICE TO ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BENEFITS. THIS PROGRAM IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL FOR FUTURE OUTREACH PROGRAMS FOR CAL THAT. I JUST HAVE A FEW CONCLUDING REMARKS BUT MAYBE. WATER PAUSE HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS. OF WE HAVE A QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARC BERMAN WERE ROUGH THANK YOU -- YES SO YOU SAID YOU'RE AT OF THE CAL TOP PROGRAM IS AT TWENTY TWO FACILITIES I ASSUME THAT INCLUDES CAPITAL. TEN PICK INCLUDE A WILSON WAS THE PILOT AND WHEN THE OTHER ARMY NAVY AIR FORCE MARINES AND COAST GUARD INSTALLATIONS HEARD ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE. THEY CLIMBED OVER EACH OTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD DO THE SAME THING ON THEIR BASIS THAT'S EXCELLENT SO HOW MANY SERVICE MEMBERS ARE SERVING PER YEAR OR PER MONTH TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION HANDY [inaudible] NO. TWENTY COME UP AND SAY IT AGAIN PLEASE. THE KING BED DEPUTY KEEP BOYLAN. VETERAN SERVICES. HI -- GOOD AFTERNOON. NATIONWIDE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILITARY PERSONNEL EXIT ON THROUGHOUT THE YEAR APPROXIMATELY AND RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA. AND YOU HAVE THE BREAKDOWN FOR PENDLETON -- WE DON'T EXACTLY NOW -- AND YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT AVERAGES ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PARTICIPANTS. EVERY SESSION WHICH IS ABOUT ONCE A MONTH NAY USUALLY HAVE A JUNE GENERAL ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FOLKS THAT EXIT OUT OF THEIR PER MONTH -- IDEALLY WHAT WE DO INITIALLY IS TRY TO FIND THOSE FOLKS THAT HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED THEY'RE PLANNING ON STAYING IN CALIFORNIA OR HAVE ANY KIND OF HOPES DREAMS OR THOUGHTS OF STANDING CALIFORNIAN THOSE THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO TARGET MAKE SURE THEY GET INTRODUCED TO THEIR COMMUNITY NETWORK OF CARE. THAT'S EXCELLENT AND ON THAT POINT DECIDED TO TRANSITION BUT THEY AREN'T SAYING CALIFORNIA BUT HAVE THAT DREAM OF RETURNING TO CALIFORNIA -- HOW DO YOU REACH THEM TO INFORM THEM ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WE OFFER HERE -- WE HAVE NO UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHERE THE BIG CHALLENGES -- FEDERALLY IT'S NOT KNOW WHETHER STATE HAS THIS PROGRAM ON THE STATE LEVEL IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT'S STILL. A VERY SCATTER SHOT IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING VETERANS AS THEY RETURN YOUR STATE WERE. OR FORTUNATELY -- MUCH FURTHER ALONG THAN MANY OTHER STATES BUT AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THE STATE STATES ARE DRAGGING FAR BEHIND IT HAVEN'T REALLY. JUST HAVING A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME EVEN IDENTIFYING VETERANS WHEN TEY RETURN TO THEIR STATE -- WE SIMILARLY OF HAD THAT CHALLENGE WE WE GET INFORMATION ON VETERANS RETURNING THROUGH A DIGITAL DATABASE OF THEIR HOME OF RECORD BUT REALLY -- THERE'S NO WARM HAND OFF ON ONE LEAVES THE MILITARY FROM A POST OUTSIDE THE STATE AND RETURNS. SELL PART OF CAL TAP IS CREATING THAT STAY COLLECT COMMITTEE BASED SYSTEM OF CARE SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT ENTRY POINT THAT VETERAN COMES INTO. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH US CITY COUNTY OFF OF SOME SORT -- THAT WERE CONNECTED WITH THAT ENTRY POINTS SO THEN WE CAN GET THEM KIND OF INTO THAT. INTO THAT SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY -- PUT THEM ON THE RIGHT PATH TO WHATEVER SERVICES THEY NEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH. Q. OF THE BY I HAD A A JUST ANOTHER -- QUESTION ABOUT CAL TAP YOUR TALK ABOUT MOVING INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH I THINK IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO REACH OUT BUT WE ONLY HAVE EIGHT NEW STAFF MEMBERS SO HOW ARE YOU -- AT HOW DOES THAT LOOK YEAH LEE RITUAL STAFFING FOR THE PROGRAM WAS FIVE SO ARE TOO BIG PUSHES -- OBVIOUSLY THE CAL TAP IS VERY MUCH ARM FROM IS IS EVEN PER YEAR PER UNIT -- ENLISTMENT. TO FINALIZATION AND BURIAL AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN ANY ANY POINT TO THAT VETERAN HAS A TRANSITION OUR LIFE BETTER IN SPECIFIC OR NOT AS AN AGENCY WE FEEL AS A LEAD ADVOCATE. WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CONNECTION SO WE TRY TO MAKE THAT RELATIONSHIP AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE MINUTES TIME HOUSES. WHATEVER TRANSITION THAT BETTER AND MAYBE -- FOR PART OF THAT IS. TOO BIG OUT THE GATE PRIORITIES WE MADE OUR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALMOND CSU SYSTEM. WE FIRST STARTED WE HAD PENSION GOING IN WE DID. A FEW DOWN SOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THEN WE HAD THE MILITARY VETERANS MILITARY GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL MEETING WHEN I PUT OUT THE PLEA. AND INFORM FOLKS ABOUT WE'RE DOING A CAMP PENDLETON AND IT WAS PEOPLE WERE EXCITED WELL THAT ABSORB THOSE FIVE PEOPLE TO PUT THOSE TWENTY THREE POSTS ONLINE VERY RAPIDLY. BECAUSE FORTUNATELY IT'S A IT'S NOT EVEN ADJUSTED ADDITION TO THE EXISTING PROGRAM WE HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE DAY WHERE IT'S OUR AGENDA -- SO IT'S PRETTY INVOLVED. THEN IT GAVE US THE NEEDED WE FOUND QUICKLY THAT THE COMMITTEE CALL SYSTEM WAS SOMETHING WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BAND WITH FOR SO. THOSE EIGHT FOLKS COUPLED WITH FORTUNATELY A LOT OF A LOT OF WORK FROM YOUR OFFICE. ON THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SUPPORT IN THE VRC TO DEVELOP THE OUR CITIES THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN FINALLY FINALLY THERE'S BEEN SOME STABLE FUNDING FOR THAT. THAT THAT COUPLED WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE GRANTS THAT ARE BEING PUT OUT BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THE VRC DEVELOPMENT. IS WORKING RIGHT IN TANDEM WITH OUR DEVELOPMENT OF THE CAL TECH PROGRAM SO FORTUNATELY. MOM SIMILAR TO THE MILITARY POSTS ARE OUR STAFF IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR PUTTING THOSE TOGETHER -- FACILITATING THE PROGRAMS BRING IN THE COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER GATHER HOLDERS TOGETHER. IN SOME CASES WERE STATE AGENCIES CALLIE CHAR FOR INSTANCE WHEN IT FIRST STARTED THEY FOUND THAT THEIR THEIR STAFF MEMBER WAS OUT OF THE OFFICE ALL THE TIME I GOT A CALL AND SAID HI YOU KNOW. JOE'S ALWAYS GONE NOW WE'RE LIKE WELL WE LOVE JONES AND CYCLE WE NEED IN THE OFFICE WE CAN REALIZE THIS IS GOING TO BE SUCH. AN ASK SO SOME OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ON WE'VE HAD TO USE THE STAFF MEMBERS TO FILL IN THE SPOTS AND GIVE THEIR PRESENTATION FOR THEM SO TO SPEAK. OM AND HELP THEM WITH SIGN UP FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AND DO ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS OTHER LIKE WORK FOR WHERE'S THEIR THEIR EVERYTIME DCA IS THERE EVERY TIME. DEPENDS ON THE BAND WITH SO THOSE EIGHT FIVE PEOPLE WILL BE IT'LL BE VERY COORDINATED BETWEEN. TRYING TO STAND UP THE PROGRAM ITSELF FACILITATE THOSE EVENTS ARM FILL IN INTO THE PRESENTATIONS WHERE STATE AGENCIES OR EVEN COMMITTEE PROVIDERS DON'T HAVE THE BAND WITH TO MAKE ALL THE STOPS. GENERALLY WE WE TRY TO BRING IN THAT COMMUNITY SYSTEM OF CARE IN EACH AREA LIKE WHATEVER COMMUNITY COLLEGES NEXT TO THAT MILITARY POST. ARM OR OR SEE ISSUE OR WHATEVER THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT COME IN AS WE TRY TO USE ALL THOSE LOCAL RESOURCES MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND THE DUTIES OF OUR STAFF ARE MORE SO FOCUSED ON LIKE I SAID CORD AGED CORD ADVANCE -- BRING IN ALL THE PARTNERS AND THEN HELP FACILITATED ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE. IF I COULD JUST QUANTIFY ONE ASPECT OF THIS CASE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS TAKE OFF THEIR UNIFORMS SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD AND COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. FOR THOSE AMONG THEM THAT CHOOSE EDUCATION AS THEIR FIRST NEXT ADVENTURE IN LIFE 90% OF THEM STAR IN A CUTE THE TWO YEAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE 90%. THEY DON'T GO TO THE UC SYSTEM. RIGHT OFF THE BAT. SEC SO THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW EIGHT WHY HE ROBBED BANKS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING AFTER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUNDING OVER THE LAST. COUPLE OF YEARS -- TO FUND THOSE AT CENTER SO ALL A GREAT DIFFERENCE ARE COMING TOGETHER VERY NICELY A CAN YOU I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOU ON THE SEE SAVE PROGRAM BUT CAN YOU TALK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES -- THAT THEY'VE BEEN HAVING WITH -- ISSUING SUSPENSIONS TO FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW WELL [inaudible] I'M. I'M GONNA LET KEITH HANDLE THIS BECAUSE RIGHT MAY BE -- MY LANGUAGE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME AND YOUR THAN HAS RESUMEN. ON IT'S IT'S OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE YOU'RE WELL AWARE IT'S IT'S A IT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE WITH THE IN ND I WOULD SAY CALIFORNIA HAS THE THE CHALLENGE OF OVERSIGHT OF MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED INSTITUTIONS AND SAY POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS THAT'S PUBLIC PRIVATE NONPROFIT OR FOR PROFIT -- THAT IS SOMETHING WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR EFFORTS THERE. HOWEVER IT IS AN OVERWHELMING CHALLENGE AT TIMES ON THE WAY THE PROGRAM BREAKS DOWN IS THE VA THERE'S A BENEFIT BASICALLY THAT. YOU GONNA MILITARY GET THE GI BILL INCREDIBLY GENEROUS BENEFIT INCREDIBLY GENEROUS BENEFITS -- HAVING THE MOST SCHOOLS AROUND. THE MOST VETERANS AND THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING ARE ALL FACTORS THAT MAKE THIS. PARTICULARLY CHALLENGE TO MANAGING CALIFORNIA LOT OF FOLKS COME HERE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- NOT ALL TO PROVIDE THE BEST EDUCATION TO OUR VETERANS IN THE STATE. HAVING SAID THAT LIKE I SAID WE OVERSEE ANY PRIVATE ANY POST SECONDARY PRIVATE PUBLIC FOR PROFIT NONPROFIT DEGREE -- THAT YOU COULD BE A NON GREED NON AN NC NON COLLEGE DEGREE PROGRAM A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM TWO THOUSAND NINE THEY REDID THE GI BILL TO ALLOW VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS. IN THAT THAT REALLY -- MASON GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WE DO ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND PROGRAMS INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT WE OVERSEE AND IDENTIFY -- IN APPROVED. IN. EVALUATION SAY AND APPROVE. WITH THAT -- WITH OUR CONTRACT WITH THE VA THERE'S ALSO THE REQUIREMENT TO ON TO WHAT'S CALLED COMPLIANCE SURVEYS. SO WHEN IT BREAKS DOWN FOLKS GOING THE MILITARY TO GET THIS WONDERFUL BENEFIT. WHEN THEY GET OUT OF THE MILITARY CONGRESS REALIZED OKAY THESE FOLKS ARE GOING BACK TO WHATEVER STATE? WE UNDERSTAND THIS THE FEDERAL BENEFIT THE MUST BE DISTRIBUTED. HOWEVER EVERY STATE HAS THE RIGHT. TO SAY WHAT EDUCATION IS IN THEIR STATE. SUFFER THE SCA COMES AN ESSAY A EVERYTHING TO DO WITH PAYMENT IS Vl <u>&lt;c.green&gt; EVERYTHING TO DO WITH&lt;/c&gt;</u> APPROVALS. IS AS A THAT DISTINCTION IS NOT SO CLEAR ALL THE TIME. A LOT OF THE THINGS WE DO THEY MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH. THEY PAY SCHOOLS THAT WE MIGHT THINK THEY SHOULD BE BUT THEY CONTROL THAT AND IN THEORY WE CONTROL. THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT. A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF WHEN THE RIGS ARE PUT IN PLACE FEDERALLY. THEY COULD HAVE THEY COULD BE A LITTLE CLEARER -- THERE'S SOME AMBIGUITY IN DIFFERENT PARTS THAT ARE OPEN FOR INTERPRETATION TIME WE CERTAINLY DON'T. AGREE WITH THE VA ON THAT INTERPRETATION. WE'VE TAKEN STEPS WITHIN THE STATE TO DEVELOP WHAT'S CALLED A REASONABLE CRITERIA WITHIN THE CONTRACT. IT WITHIN LEGISLATE WITHIN THE REGULATIONS AND SEE HOW FAR IT ALLOWS THE STATE TO DEVELOP WHAT'S CALLED -- REASONABLE CRITERIA -- SO SOME YEARS BACK AB TWENTY NINETY NINE WE GOT PASSED WITH YOUR SUPPORT VAN. ON THAT ALLOWED THE RECOGNIZE THAT AUTHORITY WITHIN THE STATE ITSELF -- SO WHAT THAT DOES IS THINGS THAT THE VA MIGHT NOT THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR SCHOOL TO DO -- WE IN CALIFORNIA CAN DECIDE THAT WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE -- A HURDLE THAT THAT SCHOOL MUST. MUST CROSS IN ORDER TO BE APPROVED HERE IN THE STATE -- THE GENERAL IS WHERE A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THE VA. HAPPEN IN THAT AREA -- ADDITIONALLY ON THE FRONT AND THE ONE THING THAT THE STATE. CONTROLS IF. FORTY WITHOUT QUESTION. IS IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS SO. COUPLE YEARS BACK TO VA TRIED TO STANDARDIZE THE WHICH WE FOUGHT VERY HARD AGAINST. ON THE STATE AT THIS POINT STILL HAS THE RIGHT TO PUT IN THE APPLICATION WHAT IT FEELS NECESSARY. AND WE REALIZE THAT'S THE ONE PLACE WHERE WHEN PEOPLE FIRST COME TO THE TABLE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO ASK QUITE A LOT OF THEM. AND THAT INCLUDES TAX RETURNS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCREDITATION REPORTS ALL THESE THINGS THAT IN THE PAST THEY HAD NEVER ASKED FOR BEFORE. ANTM. SEC THAT THE POST SOME CHALLENGES AND WE WE A THE SCHOOL'S OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. MIGHT BE PRODUCT PROBLEMATIC TOWARDS THEIR APPROVAL -- SO THOSE ARE GENERALLY THE BROAD BROAD AREAS OF WHERE WE WE RUN INTO. RENTED THE CHALLENGES IN THE PROCESS. SO CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT -- BRIGHT WOULD DID THEY ATTEMPT -- TO SUSPEND. BRIGHT WOODS SCHOOLS WE DID. WE DID WE WE ACTUALLY HAD JUST REINSTATED THEM. PRIOR TO THEM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT WAS DUE -- TO DIRECTOR FROM THE VA -- THAT REQUIRED US -- TO SO WHEN A SCHOOL IS APPROVED WHAT WHEN A SCHOOL COMES US A SCHOOL HAS TO GO THROUGH CERTAIN STEPS BEFORE THEY COME TO US. IF THERE ARE CREDIT INSTITUTIONAL MISSIVE TO BE ACCREDITED IF THEY'RE APPROPRIATELY THEY HAVE TO BE REGISTERED SECRETARY STATE THEY HAVE TO DO ALL THE DIFFERENT BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO SCHOOL MUST. ON APPROVAL WES IS PREDICATED ON APPROVAL BY THE BUREAU FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. NOW WHEN WE GET THIS INFORMATION OUR APPLICATION THEIR ACCREDITATION REPORT. THEY'RE BPP APPROVAL ARE AND AND THE DETAILS OF THAT ANY THIS INFORMATION FROM THEIR CREDIT. ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- THEY HAVE TO DISCLOSE WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY PENDING LAWSUITS VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS. THAT ARE GOING ON ALL INFORMATION THAT WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT IN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION [inaudible] OUR WE WOULD QUESTION SOME OF THAT. AND THE VA. SAID WILL BASICALLY. IF THEY'RE APPROVED BY ALL THESE OTHER ENTITIES THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM. I SAID WELL BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED AT THE INFORMATION AND THOSE ENTITIES HAVE THEM APPROVED -- BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE. IT'S SIMILAR TO CURRENT AND BACK WHEN WHEN WE PULLED CORINTHIANS APPROVAL A YEAR BEFORE THEY CLOSE THEIR DOORS ON BECAUSE WHAT WE SAW ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SOME OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE HAVING. THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE HEMORRHAGING MONEY AND THAT FOLKS WERE A HUGE RISK AND THAT THE END WAS NEAR. WE PULLED THEIR APPROVAL NOW BY DOING SO WE SAVED VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA YEARS WORTH OF JR THERE ARE IN GI BILL BENEFITS. SAME SITUATION EFFECT ACCREDITING BODY REPORTS AS THE SCHOOL'S HORRIBLE. BUT THIS DEAR CREDITOR ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE TO THINK THEIR CREDITORS BEING PAID BY THE SCHOOL. IN THEIR PROVIDE NUMBER SERVICE SUPPORT OF THAT SERVICES HEY WE KNOW WE KNOW YOU'RE HORRIBLE. WILL GIVE YOU A YEAR TO GET BETTER. WELL CONFEDERATE RELATIONS SAYS THAT SCHOOL IS APPROVED FOR C. SAFE AT ALL TIMES. SO WITH A GREAT WE'RE GONNA PULL YOUR APPROVAL AND WHEN YOU'RE ALL BETTER IN YOUR CREDITING BODY FEELS THAT YOU'RE ALL BETTER. YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO COME BACK IS NO COST FOR APPLICATION SO COME BACK IN. CHOSE YOUR PAPERWORK AND SHOW THAT ALL THOSE -- DEFICIENCIES OF IN MATT WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO APPROVE YOU AGAIN -- THAT DOES NOT GO OVER VERY WELL -- BRIGHT WOOD WAS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS ACTUALLY THERE WAS ABOUT TWELVE SCHOOLS. OVER THE SUMMER THERE WAS A LAWSUIT INVOLVED THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES AROUND THAT BUT BRIGHT WHAT IN PARTICULAR SO DIED STALKS THE VA AND SAID WELL. IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN YOU IN IS VERY AT THE VERY LEAST NEED TO PUT THAT IN WRITING. SO THEY PUT OUT A OF A NATIONAL DIRECTIVE OF SORTS -- STATING THE FOLLOWING WHICH IT'S QUESTIONABLE I GUESS THERE'S FOLKS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ARGUING OUT WHETHER. THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WRITE THAT DIRECTIVE OR NOT BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS. WAS ENOUGH OF A DIRECTION TO US WE NEEDED TO COMPLY. OM. AT RISK OF LOSING THE STATE CONTRACT IF WE FAILED TO COMPLY. SO WE DID ARM. IN BRIGHTWOOD WENT OUT OF BUSINESS A FEW WEEKS LATER. WHICH I MEAN THE THE BOTTOM LINE THE STORY COULD HAVE GONE MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SO FORTUNATELY ONE OR THE OTHER ON VETERANS OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT BENEFITTED A SCHOOL THAT'S GOING. TO THAT'S GOING TO BE OF SOME VALUE DOWN THE ROAD BUT IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS CURRENTLY. CLOTHING ON JUST SO I UNDERSTAND SO YOU TRY TO SUSPEND BRIGHT WHERE THEY WERE REPORTER THEY WERE DISAPPROVED THEN YOU ARE ALL BASICALLY IRRITATED BEEN DISAPPROVED FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS A YEAR OVER IN BY THE A YEAH. YES OKAY YEAH DO WE HAVE ARE THE OTHER QUESTIONS. A ASSEMBLYMEMBER BROKE. THANKS MADAM CHAIR IS NICE TO BE BACK HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE MISTER SECRETARY GOOD TO SAY I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION LAST WEEK. THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE IN THE ARMY OUR COUNTRY THANKS FOR CONTINUE SERVICES A SECRETARY JUST OF QUICKLY FOLLOW UP ON THAT. ARE THERE ANY SCHOOLS ON YOUR RADAR SCREEN RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT COULD BE IN TROUBLE -- I I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T I'M. THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S USUALLY ARE OUR STAFF VERY ACTIVE THERE'S ALWAYS SCHOOLS BEING APPROVED OR OR THEY'RE IN SOME PROCESS OF THE APPROVAL SO. I'M I'M SORRY NO THAT DOESN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I I DON'T HAVE THE SHORE A SHORT LIST OF FOLKS THAT ARE. THAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE pIT'S BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED HERE RECENTLY THAT ASHFORD -- ONCE AGAIN. APPLIED TO CALIFORNIA -- AND WE OPTED -- TO I NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO ACT WHICH IS IT'S ONE OF THE OPTIONS WE HAVE WITHIN THE CODE OF FEDERAL FEDERATIONS -- WE HAVE HAD A BIT OF YOU KNOW IN A AND THIS IS ALL PUBLIC INFORMATION IN. IN ONE NEWSPAPER ANOTHER BUT THE V. A SEND US A NOTE. STATING THAT THEY FELT WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OPTION -- DUE TO THE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT THAT WE SIGNED SO SILLY RESPONDED WHICH IS ALSO NOTED IN THE ARTICLE -- WITH AN ATTACHMENT OF MY LETTER TO THEM WHICH SHOWED THAT -- IT'S IT'S I WANTED TO IN THE WEEDS WITH THAT BUT MORE OR LESS THE LAW SAYS YOU HAVE OPTIONS A. B. AND C. AND THE V. A SANE WORLD BASED ON OUR COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WE ONLY WANT TO GIVE YOU OPTIONS A AND B. SO -- IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE STILL YET TO BE WORKED OUT BUT ASHFORD AS YOU KNOW IS ON IT MAY NOW IT'S THEIR CURRENTLY HAVE A VARIETY OF LOS IT'S GOING ON NATIONWIDE WITH A VARIETY OF ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INCLUDING OUR OWN. SO BASICALLY THAT THAT NOTICE OF INTENT NOT TO ACT IS REALLY IT'S KIND OF THE FAIR THING TO DO -- IT WOULD BE PREMATURE OF US TO APPROVE ASHFORD'S INFORMATION ARE ARE DECLINE OR SAY THEY DON'T MEET THE STANDARDS NOT KNOWING WHAT. THAT LAWSUIT IS GONNA TURN OUT TO BE. ARM AND IT WOULD KIND OF BE A DERELICTION OF OUR DUTY TO APPROVE THEM -- NOT KNOWING HOW THE LAWSUIT TURNS OUT AS WELL SO THIS PART OF THE CODE ALLOWS FOR A STATE UPROOTING SHE TO REFER THIS BACK TO THE VA. ON WHICH THEN THE ASHFORD DOES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE APPROVED OR DENIED DIRECTLY BY THE VA SO. I'M NOT SURE THE VA'S THRILLED ABOUT HAVING A BALL AND FOR OVER SOME OTHER ISSUES IN ARIZONA. BUT THE OLD THE REGULATIONS ALSO STATE VERY CLEARLY THE VA AT THAT POINT WOULD BE -- REQUIRED TO HAVE THE FTC OR ANOTHER AGENCY -- LOOKING TO OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CONCERNS IN A NOTHER AG'S CONCERNS AND THEN THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ASH -- FOR BUT FOR US PERSONALLY WE'VE NEVER EVEN GOT TO THE A SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW OF ASHER'S APPLICATION -- JUST BECAUSE WE WE FILLED IT WOULDN'T BE. TO BE THE RIGHT THING WENT ONCE YOU RECEIVED IT AND THIS IS THE THAT WE DID THIS LAST TIME. THEIR DATA. APPLIED IN THE VA HAD NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. ON AN INTERESTING ENOUGH THIS TIME THE ASHFORD PERCENT BACK AT THE VA'S REQUEST SO THAT WAS KIND OF ODD KNOWING THAT. ON THE PUTTING CALIFORNIAN AND REALLY AWKWARD SITUATION WHEN THE BALL'S CLEARLY IN THEIR COURT SO. WILL YOU KNOW IF YOU KEEP YOU INFORMED ABOUT THAT AND CHRISTIAN FOLLOWS A VERY CLOSELY. IN TOUCH WITH OUR OFFICE SO. ON I'M SURE I'LL KEEP THE COMMITTEE UP TO SPEED ON WHAT HOW THAT'S MOVING ALONG BUT ON THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY GLARING THAT'S IF YOU WOULD KEEP US UP TO DATE OF HEARING POTENTIALLY DOWN THE ROAD -- TEN ON A POSITIVE NOTE IN MY DISTRICT WEBSITE ABOUT COLLEGE TARRANT WONDER TERRENCE NELSON RUNNERS IS TESTED VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER DOWN THERE. LOT OF ANGEL PENDLETON DISCHARGE START THEIR EDUCATION THEIR SADDLEBACK SO -- IN APPRECIATE SUPPORT OF THOSE CONSERVE TURNS IS WONDERFUL HE WAS HE WAS PART OF OUR PILOT PROGRAM AT CAMP PENDLETON WITH -- CAL TOP PROGRAM SO HE'S THE ONE WHO COMES IN AND TEACHRS FOLKS HOW TO ACCESS THE COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM AND AND SO FORTH SO YEAH HE'S HE'S WONDERFUL GUY RUNS A GOOD SHOW DOWN THERE. RIGHT WE ARE RUNNING. OUT OF TIME BUT I JUST. OF FOR AND THE SECRETARY. OF THE V. H. H. P. PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING VERY WELL AND AND I KNOW MY DISTRICT ARE A COUPLE OF HOMES THAT ARE BEING BUILT. BEFORE WE LOOK AT AND AND YOU'VE JUST SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT THAT THERE'S A FEW MORE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BEDS -- BUT ARE ARE YOU GOING TO BE LOOKING AT WHETHER -- THERE IS ADDITIONAL NEED BE BEYOND THE CURRENT FUNDING HOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EVALUATE HOW THAT PROGRAM IS DOING AND THEN MAYBE FOR JUST FOLLOW THAT UP WITH YOUR WRAPPED UP -- WELL -- AND AND YOU CAN KEEP THIS SEMESTER VHS PS OF FOR HIS WE'VE PUT OUT IT'S GOING TO BE AT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR MADE. FORTY THREE ELEVEN THREE OUT OF THREE ELEVEN WILL PROBABLY GET TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. THEIR SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE KITTY SO WE'VE PROBABLY BRING TO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF -- BUT WE WILL KEEP LOOKING BALANCING THE NEED AGAINST WHAT WE STILL HAVE TO OFFER INTO THAT WE KNOW THAT MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL ARE LIKELY TO SCOOP UP VETERANS IN THAT MIX ALSO BUT WE HAVE OUR PULSE ON THE ON THE VETERAN SPECIFIC HOMELESS -- YOU KNOW WE GOT 10% OF THE NATION'S POPULAR 12% NATION'S POPULATION 10% OF THE NATION'S VETERANS. 29% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS AND 54% OF THE NATION'S ON SHELTERED VETERANS MEANING THOSE VETERANS WHO DO NOT HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD OF ANY KIND. SO WE'RE WE'RE EARLY IN EVERY OTHER WHICH WAY OBLIGATED TO WORK ON THIS SO WILL CONTINUE JUST TO STUDY THAT AND IF YOU -- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE WILL BE MORE NEED WHEN WE GET INTO THE FIFTH AND SIXTH NOW. FOR MY AND JUST AND JUST ADD THAT'S KIND IT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MORE SPECIFICALLY THAT'S HOW WE GET TO THAT NUMBER IS. THAT NUMBER HE TALKED ABOUT HIS ON SHELTERED THE THE POINT TIME COUNT THAT TAKES PLACE AT THE END OF THIS MONTH BOMB. BASICALLY GIVES YOU WHAT ON SHELTERED MEANS IS THAT GOING TO THING THEY SAY THE SOME THE HOMELESS FOLKS THEY HAVE IN THIS AREA THIS IS HOW MANY ON SHELTER ON SHELTER IS THE NUMBER WHEN YOU TAKE. HOMELESS MINUS ALL CURRENTLY AVAILABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. HOW WHAT'S THE SHORTFALL THERE -- AND THEN YOU GET A NUMBER SO CHEN IS AROUND SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND FOR THE STATE GENERALLY FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IT HAS IT WENT UP A LITTLE LAST YEAR. BUT SO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT IS ARM. WE PUT OUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AROUND. THE NEXT NO FOR IS TO BE RELEASED IN THE FALL SO THAT WOULD BE A GRANTING PERIOD SOMETIME AROUND THIS TIME NEXT YEAR PROBABLY. AND WE'RE PUTTING ASIDE EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER THAT SO YOU FIGURE SEVENTY FIVE AND SEVENTY FIVE TO ONE FIFTY WE HAVE. THREE YEARS OR SO. LEFT ON MAYBE TWO MORE ROUNDS AND THEN THE THIRD ROUND WILL RAFTER RELOOK REALLY HARD IT WHETHER. THIS NEEDS TO BE MAYBE BEFORE THAT BUT LOOK REALLY HARD AT WORK WHERE THIS NEEDS TO BE AND THEN THAT'S HOW WE GET TO THAT NUMBER OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT GAPS GOING TO BE IS TAKING ON SHELTER VERSUS HOW MANY. WE'VE BUILT AND THEN. I KIND OF DO A LITTLE MATH THERE AND TRY TO SORT OUT EXACTLY HOW MANY THAT LEAVES. THANK YOU FOR THAT.
