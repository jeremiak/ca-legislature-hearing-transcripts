YOU FOR BEING HERE. EXACTLY AT NINE THIRTY WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED TO ONE WELCOME EVERYONE. AS WELL AS OUR CO CHAIRS SO FOR THIS HEARING. DR -- WORK AS WELL AS A MISTER BLOOM. AT THIS HEARING IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO OPEN -- THE CONVERSATION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ON THE ISSUE OF SAFE. CLEAN DRINKING WATER. HOW TO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS STATE ALONG WITH PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT? THE SALINAS VALLEY CENTRAL VALLEY AND OF NNOUNCED A CALIFORNIA DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. WHETHER WELLS HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED OR THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE WITH NEARBY WATER SYSTEMS THE NEED IS DIRE FOR THOSE. UNABLE TO DRINK CLEAN WATER. IN SOME AREAS STATE HAS MONEY READY TO GO TO BILL TREATMENT PLANTS. REPORTS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THOSE PLANS THERE LOCALLY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES OF THESE PROJECTS -- UNFORTUNATE CANNOT MOVE FORWARD. WITH THIS HEARING WE HOPE TO LEARN ABOUT THE ISSUE FURTHER -- INFORMATION AND DETAILS OF HOW TO APPROACH THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. AND HAVE THE DIALOGUE WITH MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND MOVING FORWARD WE ARE COMMITTED TO TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE TO GET TO A PLACE OF COMMON INTEREST -- I BELIEVE WE CAN ACHIEVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO KIND OF BREAK DOWN SOME OF THESE. ISSUES SILOS THAT EXIST AND TO BRING UP ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER -- WE'RE HERE TO LISTEN. AND HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH SOME GOOD. TANGIBLE A NEXT STEPS AND PUBLIC POLICY SOLUTIONS IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE -- BEFORE I INTRODUCED A CENTER MORNING I'D LIKE TO ASK A MISTER BLOOM AND FOLLOWED BY MISTER QUICK TO SAY A FEW OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER. THERE WE GO -- MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU CHAIR GARCIA -- THANK YOU FOR A TO OUR STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TOGETHER -- IT IT SO ALMOST A CANARD AT THIS POINT -- THAT ALMOST EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE STATE REPEATS -- AD NAUSEAM -- TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO MEMBER IN A TED TALK TO OTHER FOLKS -- AND AND IF I THINK EVERYBODY ELSE'S SACRAMENTO DOES THE TWO WERE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. AND THEREFORE WHY CAN'T WE WELL IN THE BLACK AND ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WOULD SEEM MOST OBVIOUS IS OUR SEEMING INABILITY TO PROVIDE. A CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO EVERY CALIFORNIA. I'D ALMOST A MILLION CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE THAT ACCESS TODAY THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE THE THESE FOLKS ARE SPREAD OUT IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND SO. TOO MANY OF US THEY'RE NOT SEEN ON A DAILY BASIS BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- PUTTING TOGETHER A GROUP OF A MILLION PEOPLE. STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. YOU CAN VISUALIZE THE EXTENT OF THIS ISSUE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD FRANKLY BE ASHAMED OF HI WE HAVE. OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SAFE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE -- AND WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE FRAMEWORK TO PERMANENTLY SOLVE THIS CRISIS NOT IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING IT NOW BY TRUCKING IN WATER AND MAKING PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW BRING BOTTLED WATER INTO THEIR HOMES. OF WE ALL. HAVE A RIGHT TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN FACT CALIFORNIA LAWS OF AS OF A FEW YEARS AGO STATES THAT. IT'S A IT'S A A HUMAN RIGHTS AND A VERY BASIC. ONE UP FRANKLY I THINK UGH A GIVEN THE YEOMAN'S EFFORT -- TO THAT SENATOR MINING HAS PUT INTO THIS AND THE FACT THAT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN IN FRONT OF US NOW FOR MULTIPLE YEARS -- WE WISH WE SHOULD BEAR SOME SHAME AND NOT HAVING ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE ADEQUATELY AT AT AT AT THIS POINT. AND IT'S UP TO US TO GET IT DONE THIS YEAR SO THAT'S WHY THIS PANEL IS SO IMPORTANT AND LOOKING FORWARD -- TO EACH AND EVERY PRESENTATION -- AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE [inaudible] LOOK DOCTOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WHERE ONE STATE -- THE GOVERNOR SAD -- THAT WE HAVE. TO UP PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE RURAL AREAS WE HAVE TO IT IS. EVERY ONE OF US A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO TAKE CARE OF THE LEAST AMONG US. I'M FORTUNATE TO COME FROM THE DISTRICT THAT HAS GREAT WATER -- WE HAVE THE SF SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES LARRY AND A COUPLE OF LOCAL WATERSHEDS. WE HAVE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT WHICH GETS WATER FROM THEM. MCCOLLUM THE RIVER -- AND OTHER PLACES WE ALSO HAVE -- IN THIS SOUTHERN ALAMEDA COUNTY WATER DISTRICT'S THE ALAMEDA COUNTY WATER DISTRICT WE HAVE THE MONEY TO TAKE BRACKISH WATER AND TURN IT INTO CLEAN. DRINKABLE WATER. THERE ARE MANY PARTS OF THE STATE THAT SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY DON'T HAVE THE ORGANIZATION -- WE CAN ALL AGREE ON MANY WAYS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM GAPS SMALL DISTRICTS ABSORBED BY LARGER ONES TO GIVE TECHNICAL SUPPORT. BUT IN THE END THE DIFFICULT PART IS COMING UP WITH THE MONEY. AND I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER MINING FOR BRINGING FORWARD LAST YEAR IS SB SIX TO THREE WHICH WE PASSED. HOWEVER WHEN WE PASSED IT WE LEFT OUT THE DIFFICULT PART WHICH IS WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THAT IS RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S CLEARLY THE BIGGEST QUESTION IT'S THE ONLY QUESTION THAT. THAT REALLY IS UP THERE I DO PLEDGE THAT IF WE CAN BRING SOMETHING TO THE FLOOR. I WILL SUPPORT IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS AND SO I'M MAKING A COMMITMENT BEFORE IT COMES TO THE FLOOR. BUT I THINK THAT GETTING THAT MONEY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND WHETHER IT'S FROM THE GENERAL FUND WHETHER IT'S A SPECIAL TAX WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S THE TOUGH PART THAT'S THE PART. THAT SENATOR MINING IS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD WITH LEADERSHIP ON AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND IF WE DON'T DO IT WE ARE SHIRKING OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY I SEE IT'S A VERY LARGE HEARING -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR GETTING US TOGETHER -- AND FOR INCLUDING ME AND MY COMMITTEE AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AS WELL. THANK YOU DOCTOR. I THINK EVERYONE'S NOTED YOUR AYE VOTE ON A BILL FOR A IS COMPLEX PROBLEM. GET -- THAT'LL HAVE YOU BEEN EITHER LET'S OPEN UNITS CAN ALSO COMBINE YEAH THEY ALMOST -- BUT DOES IT IS STYLE THE CALIFORNIA CAN BE IN IN A WHAT WHAT IS THE THEM UP AN IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS NOT JUST BECAUSE DEMÃ³CRATAS LOCALS. STUMBLED LEAST WE DISCUSS IT WILL BE ANNOYING IS COMING IN A MUCH OF THE BUSES PORTS -- BUT TO SEE BUT SOON I'M GOING TO NOW GOING TO INTRODUCE ENOUGH. SENATOR MINING. AND HE WILL -- FRAME THE ISSUE FOR US IS MAYBE NO SIR MONNING HAS LED THE SENATE. EFFORT TO ADDRESS A SAFE IN A FOUR WHEEL DRINKING WATER FOR A FEW YEARS NOW. AND WE WELCOME HIM TO LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED TIME BOTH TOGETHER AS WE GO UP AND DOWN THE STATE CALIFORNIAN HERE FOR MARCUS STATUETTES. BUT THE ISSUE AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE HIM JOIN US ON THE PANEL AFTER HE SPEAKS OF CEREMONY FOR YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- CHAIRED GARCIA WE WHEN IS THE ESTIMATE THAT* POOREST OPPORTUNITY THAT. I WANT TO THANK YOUR CO CHAIRS BLOOM AND QUIRK ALL THE MEMBERS WHO JOINED US TODAY -- I ALSO WANNA A PARTICULAR LINK KNOWLEDGE THOSE LITTLE COMMON THE FLIGHTS AFTER MY PRELIMINARY TESTIMONY. FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP. IN THESE EFFORTS AND FOR ALL MENTAL SEARCH OF A SOLUTION FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. I THINK THIS WILL BE YOUR PROVIDING A VERY VALUABLE FORM AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR WHAT MAY BE DIVERGENT VIEWPOINTS ON SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS. I THINK WE'LL HEAR A STRONG AND RESONANT AGREEMENT ON THE GRAVITY OF THE PROBLEM IN THE CHALLENGE THAT NEEDS A SOLUTION -- FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. EFFORTS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN AND NOW THE LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR NEW SOME. HAS ALSO PUT THIS FRONT AND CENTER -- IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S BUDGET IN TERMS OF PUBLIC AWARENESS -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- THE PROBLEM AND I'M GONNA RECITE THIS WHAT IS TOO MANY NOW ALMOST A MANTRA. BUT BEARS REPEATING BECAUSE OF THE GRAVITY OF THIS ISSUE. IS THE CHAIR MENTIONED CLOSE TO ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. MOST CALIFORNIANS CAN TELL YOU FLINT MICHIGAN IS KNOWN FOR LEAD CONTAMINATION AFFECTING CHILDREN. THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE CRISIS IN FLINT MICHIGAN MANY DON'T KNOW. THAT WE HAVE IN SOME WAYS MORE GRAVE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AFFECTED. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WAS MENTIONED BY CHAIR BLOOM. WERE THE FIFTH STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IF WE WERE STANDALONE NATION. AND THIS IS JUST AN UNACCEPTABLE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. WE HAVE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE HARD WORKING MEMBERS OF OUR STATE AND OUR ECONOMY. WHO CAN'T DRINK THE WATER THAT COMES OUT? THEY CAN'T BASE WITH IT AND THEY CAN'T COOK WITH CONTAMINATED WATER. THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IS THESE TEND TO BE PEOPLE LIVING IN SMALL WATER DISTRICTS. AND IN POOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES SOME SAY IT'S JUST A PROBLEM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR THE SALINAS VALLEY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP. EACH ONE OF THOSE RED STARS ILLUSTRATES. A CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEM. IT IS NOT LIMITED. TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF THE SALINAS VALLEY THOSE ARE AREAS OF HIGH CONCENTRATION BUT VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SUFFERS FROM A CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEM. THE TOXINS INCLUDE NITRATES ARSENIC LEAD CHROMIUM SIX URANIUM TCP AND THE LIST GOES ON AND WHAT'S NOT KNOWN TO MANY IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE TOXINS. ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING. THEY BECOME EVEN MORE PROMINENT IN GROUND WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE STRESSED BY DROUGHT. IN THERE FOR CREATES A NEXUS ALSO WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. INCREASE DROUGHT MORE STRESS ON WATER SYSTEMS MORE LEACHING OF NATURAL CONTAMINANTS AND SOME ARE CAUSED BY VARIOUS PRODUCERS AND PRODUCTS. THEY ARE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IN PART OF THE SOLUTION. AS WAS MENTIONED BOND FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR A WATER TREATMENT FACILITY. BUT AS WE SEE IN ON THEIR WITH BOND MONEY USED TO BUILD A TREATMENT FACILITY [inaudible] FOR ARSENIC. THE SWITCH IS TURNED OFF BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ONE OF THE FEATURES OF OUR LEGISLATION AND OF THE GOVERNOR'S. NOW SUBMISSION TO THE BUDGET. IS THE VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT. OF RAISING A SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FUND THAT CAN BE ACCESSED NOT JUST FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE LINKING WATER SYSTEMS. BUT FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE A SMALL WATER DISTRICT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF RESIDENTS TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED YOU CAN'T RAISE THE WATER RATE HIGH ENOUGH. OR OF TO BE AFFORDABLE. TO PROVIDE THE ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. SO WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS THE SOLUTIONS. R. TO CREATE A PREDICTABLE AND RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IN THE SOLUTION IS WITHIN REACH. IT'S THE SCIENCES THERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE THE SOLUTIONS EXIST. THEY MAY BE CONNECTING. A CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEM ARE SMALL DISTRICT TO A LARGER SYSTEM WITHIN A REASONABLE SPACE. THAT. CAN TRANSPORT CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. YET MAYBE CONTRACTS CONSTRUCTION OF A TREATMENT FACILITY. AND FOR ALL IT WILL INVOLVE SOME NEED FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. AND IN OUR A MERCHANT SEE CIRCUMSTANCE AND WE ARE LIVING IN AN EMERGENCY IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T DRINK. THE WATER THAT MANY ARE PAYING FOR BUT CAN'T DRINK. BOTTLED WATER IS AN EMERGENCY. SOLUTION WE DON'T WANT BOTTLED WATER TO BE THE SOLUTION. BUT AS WE TRANSITION THESE SYSTEMS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER BOTTLED WATER SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE AS WELL BECAUSE MANY FAMILIES ARE PAYING FORTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK. FOR BOTTLED WATER ON TOP OF PAYING A WATER BILL FOR WATER THAT THEY CAN ONLY USE MAYBE TO IRRIGATE THEIR YARD. BUT NOT TO DRINK. OR BAY TH OR COOK WITH. SO WHAT'S THE PATH TO THIS SOLUTION. WE HAVE A WORKING GROUP OF OVER SEVENTY ORGANIZATIONS. INCLUDING AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY WATER DISTRICTS POLITICAL BODIES AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. THE AGRICULTURAL PARTICIPANTS IN THIS EFFORT. AGRICULTURE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MONOLITHIC IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DAIRY PRODUCERS WHO WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION WE HAVE CONTAINS CATTLE. CATTLE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF CROP PRODUCERS SPECIALTY CROPS TO ROW CROPS TO ORCHARDS. ALL OF WHOM. HAVE WEIGHED IN SAYING WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND THEN THERE'S THE RATE PAYER PIECE. AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME I THINK IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TODAY. SOME OF SAID WELL LET'S JUST ESTABLISH A TRUST FUND IN USE THE GENERAL FUND MY BILL. LAST YEAR AND WE'VE INTRODUCED SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED THIS YEAR. CHAIR GARCIA IS A CO AUTHOR ON THAT -- IT'S YOU MIGHT CALL A SPOT BILL AT THIS POINT WE WILL BE FILLING IT OUT. BUT WE BELIEVE THE RATE PAYER PIECE IS THE CRITICAL COMPONENT. TO CREATING A GUARANTEED AND PREDICTABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH IMPERATIVE. IN TWENTY TWELVE THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER PEREIRA INTRODUCED AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE IT ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN LAW A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. BUT WE HAVEN'T MADE GOOD. ON THAT LEGAL RIGHT THAT WE'VE CREATED. IN OUR PASSED LEGISLATION WE PROPOSE PROPOSED A COMBINED FEE ON CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. IN A RATE PAYER DE MINIMUS MONTHLY FEE WHILE EXEMPTING THOSE LIVING UP 22100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. UNDERSTANDABLY MANY WATER DISTRICTS DO NOT SUPPORT A REPAIR CONTRIBUTION AS PART OF THE SOLUTION. BUT EVEN WHEN IT IS LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR PER MONTH LESS THAN A CUP OF COFFEE. LESS THAN A CANDY BAR WE CALL IT A DE MINIMUS FEE. BECAUSE BY ALL JOINING HANDS BY LOOKING AT THIS AS A SHARED PROBLEM OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE ALL SHOULDER PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. AND IT REQUIRES ALL CALIFORNIANS TO STEP UP. TO HOLD HANDS AND TO SUPPORT A STATE WIDE SOLUTION. AS THE AUTHOR LAST YEAR BEST BE SIX TWENTY THREE THIS YEAR OF SP -- TWO HUNDRED AS I MENTION CO AUTHORED BY CHAIR GARCIA. I REMAIN OPEN TO TALKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. BUT I'M ALSO MINDFUL THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR GOVERNOR NEW SOME. THE SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM. AND SPEAKER RENDON OWN. ONLY BY WORKING TOGETHER CAN WE ACHIEVE THE SOLUTION. THAT FAR TOO MANY. HAVE WAITED FOR FAR TOO LONG TO REALIZE. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE CO CHAIRS FOR CREATING THIS FORM IN THIS OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ON GOING WORK. OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GARCIA BLOOM AND QUIRK SPEAKER RENDON OWN PRESIDENT PRO TEM ATKINS. GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR PULLING TOGETHER. TO SOLVE THIS NOT IN TWO YEARS NOT IN FIVE YEARS NOT IN TEN YEARS. WE CAN SOLVE IT THIS YEAR. THE ONLY THING LACKING IS THE POLITICAL WILL. AND THE WILLINGNESS TO STEP UP. SOME OF THESE VOTES ARE HARD BUT I WOULD SUBMIT. ANYONE WHO VOTES FOR THIS BILL. WITH ANY YEAR YOU'LL BE IT A RIBBON CUTTING IN YOUR DISTRICT OF THIS MONEY BEING PUT TO WORK BRINGING SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. I THINK ANYONE WHO'S CONCERNED ABOUT POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES. SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE PRIDE. IN THE RESPONSIBILITY BY WHICH YOU COULD DEFEND ANY VOTE TO ESTABLISH A CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND CO CHAIRS GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I KNOW I'M FOLLOWED BY -- EXPERTISE IN THE NEXT TWO PANELS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MONICA AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THIS ISSUE -- WE ARE GOING TO PROCEED NOW TO OUR FIRST PANEL THAT -- I'LL INTRODUCE AND THEN OUR SECOND PANEL WILL -- WHICH IS A TEACHER [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER. SENATOR WITH WITH YOUR PROPOSAL HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'RE YOU'RE PROJECTING YEARLY THAT THIS WILL GENERATE TO GENERATE ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION A YEAR. OKAY AGRICULTURE WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT. THIRTY TO FORTY MILLION OF THAT. IN THE REST WOULD BE FROM THE RATE PAYER FEENEY THAT APPORTIONMENT IS BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS. OF THE DEGREE OF CONTAMINATION BE TRACED TO AGRICULTURAL POLLUTANTS ABOUT 30%. AND ABOUT 70% OR THE NATURAL OCCURRING POLLUTANTS THAT'S WHERE WE PROPOSE TO USE A RATE PAYER FEE. AGAIN AT NINE TO GATHER SO SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY MILLION A YEAR ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO RUN ALL THE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY TO EVEN PUT A DENT IN THIS. IT'S A FAIR QUESTION -- WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE ENOUGH AND IT'S BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THESE POLLUTED. CONTAMINATED DISTRICTS ARE PROXIMITY TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER -- PART OF THE MONEY IN THE FIRST YEARS WOULD BE USED TO FURTHER PRIORITIZE. IT DOES PRIORITIZE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT THESE ARE COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHOM. ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR STATE WIDE ECONOMY WORKING IN THE FIELDS -- AND CONTRIBUTING TO THOSE IN URBAN AREAS AS WELL MAY I ASK THE QUESTION BECAUSE THE IF WE LOOK AT WHAT THE WATER BOARD ESTIMATED -- FROM -- SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THEY DISPERSED OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION -- FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WATER SYSTEMS AND I MEAN WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL SIR IS -- NOT EVEN HALF OF THAT CLEAR FINE SO I'M IN AND AND WITH THAT DO WE HAVE A COST ON HOW MUCH IT. FOR OPERATION COST ON HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO RUN. ONE OF THE SYSTEMS OF VIRTUE OF THIS SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FIND. AND THE PERPETUAL SOURCE OF OF FINDING IT CAN BE USED FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE WE CAN COMPLEMENT THAT WITH EXISTING BOND. MONIES FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS -- SOME OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT WE CAN'T USE BOND MONEY FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SO THIS. FIND HELP SUPPLEMENT WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE FROM FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS SO IT'S NOT THE ONLY MONEY AVAILABLE FOR WATER IMPROVEMENT. BUT IT SPECIALLY AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S ENOUGH MONEY FINANCIALLY WHICH IS WHY I'M WORKING ON A CA. THREE WHICH WOULD BE 2% OF THE GENERAL FUND TOWARDS THIS AND OTHER PROJECTS AND MAINTENANCE. FOR MORE THAN JUST CLEAN DRINKING WATER BUT FOR EVERYTHING IN THE PROCESS AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP THERE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. ON YOUR EFFORTS GUESSES THEIR COMPLIMENTARY MY QUESTION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR SENATOR MONNING. GREAT THE NOT A THANK YOU SENATOR WE WILL PROCEED NOW TO OUR FIRST PANEL -- WHICH IS -- SEVEN ENTITLED FRAMING THE ISSUE. OUR PANELISTS ARE JOAQUIN -- OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD SUSAN BIONDA. THE CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND WE'VE GOT. OF THE HONOR -- OF HAVING. OUR NEWLY APPOINTED SECRETARY OF NATURAL SOURCES AGENCY. WAIT CROWFOOT. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH NATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY -- CHAIRMAN AYE GARCIA CHAIRMAN BLOOM A CHARMING QUIRK AND AND MEMBERS OF OF THESE VARIOUS COMMITTEES -- MY NAME IS WAIT CRAWFORD AND I SERVICE THE NEWLY APPOINTED SECRETARY OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY -- AND IN THAT CAPACITY THIS IS MY FIRST -- HEARING ON WHICH I'M TESTIFYING FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY LOOK OUT. FOR THE BEST IS YET TO COME -- SO AS YOU KNOW THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY HAS OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND A BUDGET OF OVER FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. ONE OF OUR LARGEST DEPARTMENTS AS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WHICH HELPS PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO OVER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS. ARE SO WATER IS VERY MUCH AT THE CENTER. I IN MY PRIOR ROLES -- BEFORE IT SERVING IN THIS IN THIS ROLE -- I I HOPE TO SPARE HAD -- THE STATE'S DROUGHT RESPONSE. I AND THEN MOST RECENTLY LED AN ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON INNOVATIVE WATER SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR COMMUNITIES ECONOMY IN THE ENVIRONMENT -- I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU ON ON THESE COMMITTEES -- HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY -- I'M LEGISLATION IN EFFORTS TO IMPROVE WATER MANAGEMENT -- AND VERY THANKFUL ON BEHALF THE NATURIST ARSES AGENCY FOR YOUR WORK THERE -- WE'RE HERE OBVIOUSLY TODAY TO DISCUSS A REAL AND PRESENT CRISIS IN THE STATE -- AND THAT IS NOT TOXIC DRINKING WATER IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- AS GERMAN BLOOM -- EXPO -- WHAT I'LL DO IS IS FRAME THE ISSUE FROM OUR ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE I SHARE WITH YOU GOVERNOR NEW SUMS -- INITIAL PROPOSAL AND HIS JANUARY I BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THEN WE CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- OF COURSE. AT THAT YOU HAVE ALSO NOTE THAT WE HAVE -- AN EXPERT HERE FROM THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD -- WHO CAN -- ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A VERY DETAIL WAY INCLUDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS IS QUESTION ABOUT THE COST ESTIMATE. THANK YOU YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- FIRST OF ALL THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS ENJOY ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER -- THINKS TOO MANY OF OUR WATER UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE -- WHEN DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS ARISE IN IN COMMUNITIES? WHERE MOST OF US LIVE? WELL FUNDED -- HIGHLY TO KLAY RESOLVE -- I KNOW I'VE ONLY LIVED IN COMMUNITIES -- WHERE I TAKE FOR GRANTED THE FACT THAT WE HAVE CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER -- BUT I'VE USED AS YOU'VE HEARD IN YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A REALITY. FOR MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. I HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE LIVING IN A HOME WHERE. SHE HAD TO LEARN I ACTUALLY NOT TO DRINK THE WATER. ORDERED ACTUALLY IS IN SOME CASES TOUCH OBEYED IN THE WATER -- THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE TAPS BUT THAT'S A REALITY FOR PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. YOU KNOW TONIGHT UPWARDS OF A MILLION PEOPLE WILL LEAVE THEIR JOBS -- PICK UP THEIR KIDS AND GO HOME -- TO PLACES WHERE THEY LIVE ARE WHERE THEY CAN'T DRINK THE WATER THE WATER IS ACTUALLY GOING. TO TO IT TO MAKE THEM SO -- AND THEIR FAMILIES SEC AND I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED AND THAT'S BEYOND DEBATE -- BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING JUST THE SORT OF THE HUMAN DIMENSION OF THE PROBLEM -- SO HERE ARE THE FACTS AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM -- MOCHA -- MANY LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE PARTICULARLY THE THOSE IN SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO PROVIDE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER OUT TO THE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS -- OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN OVER THREE HUNDRED PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE STATE -- FAILED TO PROVIDE -- OR OR EXPERIENCE TOXIC WATER COMING FROM -- THEIR WATER AGENCIES AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THESE FOLKS ACTUALLY PAY THEIR WATER BILLS OFFER WATER THAT THEY CAN'T DRINK -- THEN THERE ARE ANOTHER SET OF FOLKS THAT GET THEIR WATER FROM WHAT ARE CALLED STATE SMALLS OR A STATE. SMALL DRINKING WATER AGENCIES WITH LESS THAN FIFTEEN CONNECTIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY REGULATED BY THE STATE AND THEN OF COURSE FOCUS ON DOMESTIC WELLS. AT TWO SO WHEN WE USE THIS ESTIMATE OF UPWARDS OF A MILLION. CALIFORNIANS SUFFER FROM TOXIC WATER -- WE HAVE A VERY PRECISE ESTIMATE. OF THOSE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES -- BOARD A LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE STATE'S MALLS AND THE DOMESTIC WELLS. I IN A SENATOR MINING SAID -- IN THESE COMMUNITIES. FOLKS ARE DRINKING OR OR HAVE WATER IN THEIR HOMES THAT ARE CONTAMINATED BY A RANGE OF SUBSTANCES NITRATES ARSENIC -- ACCIDENT ACTS AVAILING CHROMIUM OR CHROME -- SIX WE PROBABLY ALL KNOW THESE CONTAMINANTS -- CAN. CONTAIN CARCINOGENS AND OTHER SEVERELY DAMAGING COMPOUNDS THAT BECAUSE BOTH CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS AND HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO SHORTEN LIFE SPANS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN CENTRAL COAST REGIONS -- WHERE MORE THAN 90% OF COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON GROUND WATER IS AN AREA THAT'S OBVIOUSLY HARD HIT BY THIS CRISIS? MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE -- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALONE LACK ACCESS TO A CONSISTENT SOURCE OF SAFE AND AFFORDABLE WATER. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A RURAL PROBLEM -- IN THE URBAN COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE AND POCKETS OF OUR STATE ALSO FACE DRINKING WATER THREATS -- SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE READ RECENT I PRESSED WATER AGENCIES IN LOS ANGELES IN THE LOS ANGELES BASIN AUDIT OF HOW DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS -- THAT THEY'VE HAD DIFFICULTY ADDRESSING BECAUSE OF THE SMALL AYE IMPOVERISHED NATURE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. THIS FUND WOULD ADDRESS THAT. SENATOR MINING MENTION THE DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN FLINT IN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE ALL REMEMBER THAT WHERE FAIRLY SUDDENLY AYE LAD LEACHED FROM PIPES -- INTO FLINT RESIDENTS WATER -- AS A RESULT OF FLINT CHANGING ITS WATER SUPPLY AND NOT ADDING THE RIGHT ANTI CORROSION CHEMICALS -- AND WHAT RESULTED WAS -- TOXIC LEVELS OF LEAD IN THE WATER. I THINK WHAT'S REMARKABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION IS TODAY IN CALIFORNIA TEN TIMES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- COMPARED TO FRIENDS POPULATION ACTUALLY OP SUFFER FROM TOXIC WATER AND AGAIN THAT'S REALLY BEYOND DEBATE -- AT THIS POINT -- I THINK ALSO CENTER MINING -- DEMONSTRATED A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS AREN'T AWARE OF THIS CRISIS -- I KNOW I I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ACROSS THE STATE AND A LOT OF FOLKS THAT -- YOU WOULD THINK ON'T WOULD UNDERSTAND -- SITUATION LIKE THIS ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE AWARENESS -- OF JUST THE SCOPE OF THE CRISIS -- IN MY PRIOR FROM MY PRIOR ROLE WATER FOUNDATION -- WHICH WORKED ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW THAT PUBLIC NONPARTISAN POLLING HAS SHOWN ON THAT MORE IS KNOWN IN THE STATE. TODAY ABOUT FLINT MICHIGAN THAN ARE THEIR OWN CHALLENGES HERE -- SPALLING THAT WAS DONE IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN DEMONSTRATED THE STATE RESIDENTS ARE READY TO STEP UP AND HELP SOLVE THIS CRISIS -- AND THAT PARTICULAR -- POLLING SUGGESTED -- UPWARDS OF TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SUPPORTED A SURCHARGE OF UP TO TWO DOLLARS PER MONTH ON THEIR WATER BILLS I TO ENSURE CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SO AS MENTIONED IN THE INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON SOLUTIONS TO THIS CRISIS INVOLVES SEVERAL IMPORTANT ACTIONS -- ONE OF FUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES IN LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS BOND FUNDING -- INCLUDING SOME BOND FUNDING I TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT IS IMPORTANT TOWARDS PROVIDING THOSE ONE TIME CAPITAL UPGRADES. ALSO ANOTHER IMPORTANT ACTION IS BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THESE LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS A TREAT POLLUTION AND PROVIDE CLEAN WATER. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE SMALL COMMUNITIES. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ACTION IS CONSOLIDATING OR REGIONAL ISING SMALL SYSTEMS -- WHERE THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE WATER? AND YOUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TOOLS -- THAT THE WATER BAT BOARD HAS TO INCUR OUR NATION'S OF FAILING SYSTEMS THAT'S CLEARLY PART OF THE SOLUTION -- IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS AS LEAD IN EACH OF THESE AREAS -- AS NOTED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REMAINING CHALLENGE IS THE LACK OF A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG TERM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. WHILE BOND FUNDS PROVIDE THAT IMPORTANT ONE TIME CAPITAL -- UPGRADE -- WHAT WE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE AS IF THERE'S NOT RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY OPERATE THAT -- THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT TECHNOLOGY -- THEN THERE'S THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CLEAN WATER IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THERE ARE CERTAIN CAUTIONARY TALES WHERE THE STATE PROVIDED INITIAL ONE TIME FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. ON THAT ULTIMATELY GOT SHUDDERED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF ON GOING FUNDING. BOB CLEARLY GOVERNOR KNEW SOME HAS MADE AFFORDABLE SAFE DRINKING WATER PRIORITY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION -- WE SHARE THE VIEW THAT IN THE STATE AS AT AS RICH AND RESOURCE WEALTHIEST CALIFORNIA -- THE FACT THAT UP LARGE PORTION OF OUR RESIDENTS I CAN'T DEPEND ON CLEAN AND SAFE WATER -- IS A SHAMEFUL REALITY THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS -- AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE CAN ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM THAT'S BEYOND DEBATE BUT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO A SOLUTION. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET CONTAINS SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROPOSALS -- ON THIS TOPIC NUMBER -- ONE IT APPROPRIATE IT'S OR PROPOSES APPROPRIATE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM PROPERTY PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT THE BOND MEASURE THE PASSED IN JUNE -- TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS AND LOANS TO PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS I IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. IT PROPOSES TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLIES -- FOR FROM THE GENERAL FUND -- TO ADDRESS THESE EMERGENCIES ARE WHERE. THROUGH THE PROVISION OF BOTTLED WATER WATER TANKS ETCETERA. ALMOST LIKE EMERGENCY ROOM CARE -- THAT'S NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM BUT IT'S ADDRESSING THAT THE ACUTE LACK OF A CLEAN AND SAFE WATER. UP ANOTHER TEN MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED IN THE GENERAL FUND -- FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- IN MANY OF THESE SMALL COMMUNITIES THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD FULL TIME TECHNICAL EXPERTS. ON SO COMMUNITIES I VISITED -- THEY CAN ACTUALLY CONTRACT FOR A TECHNICAL EXPERT TO COME IN AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO CLEAN THE WATER AND ACTUALLY -- THEN OPERATE THAT TECHNOLOGY NOTE THAT BOTH I'M TEN MILLION FOR EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLIES AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- WERE CONTAINED IN AB -- SEVENTY TWO THAT THE ASSEMBLY ACTED UPON LAST WEEK -- SO THAT THOSE FUNDS HAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR MURDERS HE WATER SUPPLIES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS. ARE RECOGNIZING THE EMERGENCY NEED FOR THAT FUNDING -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ALMOST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO BOTH THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. TO TAKE INITIAL STEPS TO SET UP THIS CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND -- AND SPECIFICALLY -- TO IMPLEMENT THAT FEE COLLECTION SYSTEMS. ADOPT AN ANNUAL IMPLEMENTATION -- PLAN AND DEVELOP A MAP OF HIGH RISK AQUIFER'S -- THAT ARE USED TO DRINKING WATER SOURCES -- AND THEN OF COURSE YOU GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS BOTH CALLED FOR AND THEN SUBMITTED LANGUAGE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND -- RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR ON GOING FUNDING -- TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS -- THIS PROPOSAL AS IT'S WRITTEN IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY FRAMEWORK OF SB -- SIX TWENTY THREE THAT SENATOR MINING INTRODUCED -- IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AND I INVITE YOU IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT HOW THE FUND WORKS OUR TASK OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ARE I AS I UNDERSTAND IT ACTUALLY THAT. THE FUND -- IS FAIRLY FLEXIBLE IN THE SENSE THAT IF THE FUNDS ARE NOT NEEDED OVERTIME -- THE AMOUNT OF FEE COLLECTION WOULD REDUCE AND THE FUND -- IT HAS PROTECTIONS AROUND AMASSING TOO MUCH REVENUE -- THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET OUT TO THE FIELD -- AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO I THINK SENATOR MINING -- AND OTHERS HAVE TAKEN GREAT CARE -- TO CREATE A FUND THAT SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM BUT AVOIDS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT OTHER STATE FUNDS HAVE IN THE PAST -- I LOOK FORWARD WITH IT OUT TO WORKING WITH YOU ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS VERY EXCITED -- TO ENGAGE ON REALLY DELIVERING A SOLUTION -- THIS YEAR ON THIS CRISIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO SINCE HE TOUCHED ON THE BUDGET PROPOSAL LET ME JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT WE WILL HAVE A FULL HEARING KA KA IN BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- THREE TO ADDRESS SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND WE WANT TO OF COURSE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS HERE ON THE ISSUE AT LARGE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR GARCIA CHAIR BLOOM AND CHAIR QUIRK AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES MY NAME IS WALKING ASK ABOUT AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS ON TODAY'S PANEL. AND THANK YOU TO CENTER MINING AS WELL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AS YOU HEARD FROM SECRETARY CROWFOOT WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE MORAL IMPERATIVE TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP IN PLACE TO SEE IT ADDRESSED. I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY AND WE'VE HEARD IT SEVERAL TIMES TODAY ALREADY. THAT. THERE IS A CONSENSUS OUT THERE AND THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF AGREEMENT THAT WE CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT THAT THE WEALTHIEST STATE AND THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE COMMUNITIES FAMILIES AND CHILDREN THEY GO WITHOUT ACCESS THE CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND YET DESPITE THAT SENSE OF AGREEMENT CANDIDLY I HEAR CRITICISM THE PURSUING A CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND IS TOO PREMATURE. THAT STATE AGENCIES NEED ONLY DO MORE WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE OR THAT WE NEED TO FURTHER STUDY OR UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BEFORE PURSUING FUNDS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE GENERAL PROPOSAL TO CREATE A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT CAN BE SPENT ON THE OPERATIONS MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATION OF FAILING OR SOON TO FAIL WATER SYSTEMS. IS IN A REQUEST OF FIRST RESORT. NOR IS IT AWAY TO INDEFINITELY PROP UP UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS INSTEAD THE FUND IS THE KEYSTONE TO A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THIS STATE HAS STOP LEE PIECE TOGETHER OVER THE LAST YEAR'S. WHILE IT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE THERE'S A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSE TO COMMUNITIES WITHOUT ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AT HAND. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT STATE LEGISLATURES LEADERSHIP AND CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT ON THE ISSUE OVER THE LAST YEARS. HAVE CRAFTED A SAID OF AUTHORITIES A COMPLIMENT INFORM ONE ANOTHER AND TAKING COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE AN INTERNET PROGRAM AND A SET OF SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THE STATE. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONSOLIDATION AND REGIONALIZATION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. AS YOU KNOW. THE DIVISION A DRINKING WATER IS TRANSFERRED TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE WATER BOARD IN TWENTY FOURTEEN NOW JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. IN DOING SO THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED YOU TO BREAK DOWN THE REGULATORY SILOS THE TEND TO BUILD UP. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME GRANT AN AGENCY WITH A WIDE COMPLEMENT TO REGULATORY PROGRAMS FROM WHICH TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO THAN ESTABLISHED AN OFFICE OF SUSTAINABLE SUSTAINABLE WATER SOLUTIONS AT THE BOARD TO ENSURE THAT EFFECTIVE COORDINATION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TAKE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS PROVIDED. THE OFFICE IS NOW HELPED OVER TWO HUNDRED SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SECURE FUNDING FOR PROJECT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO GRANTED THE BOARD MANDATORY CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITIES OVER FAILING SYSTEMS GREATER ABILITY TO DENY THE PERMITTING OF NEW UNSUSTAINABLE WATER SYSTEMS. ALONG WITH THE ABILITY TO APPOINT ADMINISTRATORS TO FAILING SYSTEMS. IN FACT OVER THE LAST YEARS WE HAVE BROUGHT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SYSTEMS REGULATED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD BACK INTO COMPLIANCE. LEAVING STILL TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR TO BE ADDRESSED AND HALF IS IS NOT A SUCCESS HALF IS NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE TO SUCCESS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT OF THESE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR SYSTEMS NOT CURRENTLY MEETING DRINKING WATER STANDARDS THERE ARE STILL MORE SYSTEMS THAT ARE EITHER CYCLING IN OUT OF COMPLIANCE OR ONE HARDSHIP AWAY FROM MEETING NEWS. NEW STANDARDS OR MEETING CURRENT STATE. STANDARDS. WHILE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE AS ONE INDICATOR AND WORKING TO BRING THE NUMBER ZERO IS IMPORTANT WE KNOW THAT IT'S A NUMBER THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE THOUSANDS OF SYSTEMS WE ESTIMATE TO EXIST THAT ARE EITHER TOO SMALL TO BE REGULATED BY THE STATE BOARD. OR ARE HOUSEHOLDS DEPENDENT ON DOMESTIC WELLS. ON THAT ISSUE WE'RE GLAD WE'VE TO RECEIVE FUNDING FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST SESSION TO COMPLETE A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. ATTEMPTS TO QUANTIFY THOSE UNKNOWNS. BUT THE FACT REMAINS THERE IS A GREAT DEAL. ULTIMATELY IT'S TELLING AT THE TELLING FACT THAT 90% OF DRINKING WATER VIOLATIONS IN THE STATE ARE FROM SYSTEMS UNDER FIVE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS. WILL FRAGMENTATION OF THE WATER SECTOR MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A KEY TO THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER WE KNOW WHEN IT KNOWLEDGE THE REGIONALIZATION CONSOLIDATION OF SYSTEMS IS A CRITICAL TOOL IN ADDRESSING THEIR ON SUSTAINABILITY. THERE CON ISN'T ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT NEED TO BE MET IN ORDER TO HAVE THE RATE BASE TOOL FOR THE PROVISION OF CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND THESE FUNDS GO TO MEET THE NEED OF BRIDGING THAT GAP AND BRING SYSTEMS AND COMPLIANCE -- AS SENATOR MINING AND SECRETARY CROWFOOT HAVE POINTED OUT. IN A WHILE THE CHALLENGE OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER MIGHT SEEM TO BE A REAL ISSUE THE MAP ABOUT A COMPLAINT SYSTEM SHOWS IT'S A PROBLEM THAT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS AN URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL PROBLEMS AND THE SOLUTIONS ARE UNIQUE TO EACH COMMUNITY THIS FACING CHALLENGES. THE SOLUTIONS FOR COMMUNITIES WITH ARSENIC CONTAMINATED WELLS IN THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY. WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE STEPS THAT ARE TAKEN TO ADDRESS MALL SYSTEMS AND URBAN LOS ANGELES WITH AGING AND INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE OR COMMUNITIES IN LAKE COUNTY. WHO ARE LOOKING TO BUILD RESILIENCE AND -- FRAGMENTED SYSTEM SIR CONSOLIDATION [inaudible] ULTIMATELY. WE HAVE THE TOOLS IN PLACE I FEEL THAT THAT HELP US -- A GET CLOSER TO TO TALK TO OUR GOAL HERE. LASTLY I WANT TO BE SURE AND MAKE CLEAR THAT WHILE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MANY OF THE COMPONENTS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS WE CAN AND MUST CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES. THIS INCLUDES HAVING TECHNICAL PROVIDERS ECONOMIC A PROJECTS TO COMPLETION FOR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO DO SO. MAKING SURE WE CONSIDER AND ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ACCESS. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS AGAIN FOR PULLING TOGETHER THIS DISCUSSION. I LOOK FOR TO WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE IN ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SIR AN ARC OF FINAL PANELISTS SUSANNA DOWN GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. MY NAME IS A SON OF THE AND I AM THE CO DIRECTOR AND CO FOUNDER WITH COMMUNITY WATER CENTER. WHOSE MISSION IS TO BE A CATALYST FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZING EDUCATION ADVOCACY IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE ISSUE WATER FOR THE LAST DECADE FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS. REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE AT THIS HEARING TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT I'VE DEVOTED MY ENTIRE LIFE. TO SOME OF US LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NO SWELLING THE WATER USED TO BRUSH OUR TEETH. SOME FAMILIES HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEIR KIDS TAKE BOTTLED WATER TO SCHOOL TO AVOID HAVING TO DRINK THE WATER FOUNTAIN BECAUSE AT THE SCHOOL WE HAVE. NIGHT NITRATES ARSENIC FROM SIX SOME FAMILIES HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH WATER AT HOME SO THAT WHEN THEY HAVE IN WITH IT FAMILY COMING TO VISIT THEM THEY HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO AVOID DRINKING TAP WATER. THIS IS A REALITY THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S NOT OKAY. WHEN WE SAY? THAT OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIANS HUMANS THIS MAP TO MY RIGHT SHOWS A REALLY GOOD INDICATION OF OVER THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE HOWEVER AT THIS MAP FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALSO HAVE. MILLIONS OF PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS WITH CONTAMINATED WELLS AS WELL SO THIS DOES NOT EVEN CAPTURE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY. NOW I WILL SAY. THE MAJORITY THESE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS ARE FOUND IN LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR COMMUNITIES. AND DESPITE THE MILLION OF FEDERAL TAX DOLLARS THAT WE BILL THAT WE PASSED A BILL VAST INFRASTRUCTURE AND PASSING A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE STILL CANNOT GUARANTEE SEEM DRINKING WATER OP TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. LISTEN TO THAT. WE CAN WE EVEN WE PASS ALONG WE STILL CANNOT INSURE THAT ALL OF US CAN WAKE UP AND DRINK TAP WATER WITHOUT THE FEAR BECOMING SICK. THERE'S JUST NOT OKAY AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT SANTEE TOWNS I'M TALKING ABOUT FAMILIES COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE OWN THEIR HOME WHERE THEY PAY PROPERTY TAXES PLACES LIKE EL PART IS TO ROSY. TO LEGAL PLAIN VIEW BLUFF AND JUST BLUFF AND JENSEN COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL COAST. UNFORTUNATELY THESE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT ALONE AND CITIES ARE NOT EXEMPT AS WELL WE HAVE CITIES LIKE URBAN THE DEAL WITH OUR STICK CITIES I HAVE TRIED. TRAILER METHANE SWITCHER BY PRODUCT BY PRODUCT CHLORINATION DIVIDE A BY PRODUCT BY PRODUCT URINATION TREATMENT OF SITUATIONS AGAIN I ALSO WANT TO REMIND YOU. THAT WHEN OVER 90% OF VALLEY RESIDENTS CONTAMINANTS THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO BE EXPOSED. TO WE HAVE THINGS LIKE MY TREATS LET ME REMIND YOU NATURE IS IN THE QUEUE CONTAMINANT THAT HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE BLUE BABY SYNDROME AND CANCER AND KIDNEY DISEASE. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS ARE HARD WORKING FAMILIES. OR HAVING TO PAY SOME OF THE HIGH WATER RATES FOR WATER THEY CANNOT DRINK. AND IN MANY SITUATIONS ON PAIN SOME OF UP 210% OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ALONE JUST HAVE THE DRINKING WATER. SO WE'RE HAVING HERE WE HAVE A CRISIS WE HAVE CONTAMINATED WATER GOING THROUGH OLD AND DILAPIDATED INFRASTRUCTURE. LEAD TO PEOPLE'S TAP. I HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH TRADE OFFS TO NOT DRINK THAT TAP WATER. AND HAVE TO PAY WATER BILL THEY CAN I USE FOR DRINKING AND STILL HAVE TO BUY BOTTLED WATER. THAT IS NOT OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGES ARE MULTI FACETED. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE IT'S SYSTEMIC AND HAS SIMMERED FOR YEARS. HOWEVER AS A PROSPEROUS STATUS AS CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE THE SOLUTION. THE BIGGEST GAP TO SOLVING THE DRINKING WATER CRISIS IS PASSING THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE WATER FUND. WE NEED TO CREATE. A PERMANENT RELIABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING THE NATO. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SOLUTIONS WE NEED. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOLS. LAST YEAR IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OVER ONE FORTY LABOR COMMUNITY AND HEALTH AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATION SUPPORTED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CREATE THE SAME FOR THE FOUR OH DRINKING WATER FUND. THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE THAT WE WERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT HAVING EXTENSIVELY BEEN DISCUSSED AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND. OUR COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THE SAFER FOR DRINKING WATER POINT WILL ULTIMATELY HELP THEM SOLVE THIS ISSUE. AND BE ABLE TO OPEN UP THE TAP WATER WITHOUT THE PURE BECOMING SICK. WE LOOK TO YOU TO HELP PASS THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THIS YEAR. WE HAVE NO TIME TO WAIT ANYMORE. THE BIGGEST GAP TO THIS CRISIS IS THE LACK OF SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR COMMUNITIES. WE CAN ON YOU TO HELP US PASS THE SUPERBOWL DRINKING WATER FUN. LISTEN NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE. WHAT SCHOOL YOU GO TO OR YOU GO VISIT FAMILY MEMBERS AND SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS? WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRINK TAP WATER WITHOUT THE FEELING OF SICK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE THE DEDICATION AND THE TRUE PASSION THE TO BRING TO THIS ISSUE -- AT THIS POINT WE CAN PAUSE SUFFER QUESTIONS OF FOR ARE THERE ARE ANY FOR THIS PANEL. MISTER QUIRK -- AGAIN WE WE ALL AGREE ON THE PROBLEM. ARE WE CAN AGREE ON HOW IT CAN BE SOLVED -- BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS GRAY ON HOW TO FIND THIS. NOW. IF IT COMES OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND WE CAN ALL VOTE FOR THAT EIGHTY VOTES IN THE ASSEMBLY FORTY VOTES IN THE SENATE. COME BY OUR I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE. I CAN SAY THAT IN MY DISTRICT I DON'T EXPECT ANY OF THE MONEY TO COME TO ME THAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID WHETHER IT'S FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR A TAX OR FEE I'M WILLING TO GO AHEAD -- AND AGAIN I'M NOT ASKING THAT EVERYONE ELSE MAKE THAT PLEDGE TODAY BUT I AM ASKING YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT -- YESTERDAY -- TUESDAY WE HEARD ABOUT. THE NEED FOR FUNDS TO REDUCE FINES FOR THE VERY POOR PEOPLE GO THROUGH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THAT'S ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT COME FROM THE GENERAL FUND BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS -- HOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT I COULD I CAN'T TELL YOU -- BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IN MY DISTRICT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND IN FACT ARE COUNTIES. IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ALAMEDA HAVE AGREED INCLUDING THE COUNTY I SERVE TO FOREGO THOSE FIGHTS -- BUT IT'S IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE TO BE MADE AND I WOULD JUST ASK EVERYONE HERE. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IN THE BAY AREA AND IN LA MOST OF WHOSE DISTRICTS DO NOT INVOLVE SYSTEMS WITH WATER PROBLEMS THAT THE VOTES WILL BE THERE IF IT'S NECESSARY FOR FEAR TAX. AND I WOULD ASK THE PEOPLE FROM THE RURAL AREAS AS WELL. WHERE AND? ADMITTEDLY THERE IS A EDUCATIONAL -- URBAN AREA BUT MOSTLY IT'S CAN BE IN THE RURAL AREAS I WOULD ASK THOSE FOLKS AS WELL. TO THINK CAREFULLY RIGHT NOW AND HOPEFULLY COME TOGETHER. AND IF NECESSARY TO PASS A FEAR ATTACKS TO DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS -- MR MATHIS. SO I'LL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE I'VE GOT SEVERAL QUESTIONS REGARDING TO FUNDING -- IN THIS ARE PROBABLY BEST -- DIRECTED FOR ALL THE STRESS WALL -- AND AND MISTER CRAWFORD I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME THE ANSWERS AND AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT ALL OF YOU -- SUSAN IS FROM MY DISTRICT AND WE TALK A LOT. AND I LOVE YOUR FASHION I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE. PUSHING THIS FORWARD -- BUT AGAIN MY CONCERNS OR OR TO COST IN IF IT'S ENOUGH -- YOU KNOW WE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THERE'S OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR WATER SYSTEMS THAT WERE TRACKING PLUS. SEVERAL THOUSAND OTHER ONES SHOW HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO RUN ONE OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND I KNOW IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER IT'S OUR SNICKER NITRATE TO CETERA. OR EVEN ON THE COAST SALT WATER INTRUSION SO I MEAN DO WE HAVE AN AVERAGE COST. PER SYSTEM. THAT YOU CAN GIVE US OR OR JUST A GUESSTIMATE TO GIVE US KIND OF GO FROM POINT IT WOULD BE A GAS AND SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST THROW SOME OF FIGURE OUT TO I I CAN TALK TO OUR DIVISION THE DRINKING WATER AND SEE IF WE HAVE. YOU KNOW THE THE DIFFICULTY AS YOU POINTED OUT IS. IT DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS IT DEPENDS WHAT YOUR TREATMENT TRAIN IS IT DEPENDS THE SIZE OF YOUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER SO. YOU KNOW TO PLUCK OUT WHAT A SORT OF A NO A RANGE OF SOME SORT WILL. HALF A MILLION A YEAR A MILLION A YEAR I MEAN KIDS BECAUSE AGAIN WHAT WE WERE PROPOSING LOOKING AT IS A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION A YEAR. AND WE SEE A NUMBER LIKE. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR YOU'RE TALKING CHANGING FILTERS YOU'RE TALKING STAFFING YOU'RE TALKING KEEPING THE SYSTEMS RUNNING THE MAIN AND SIX CETERA I THINK. IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THAT FUND IS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO A TO A FULL PAY FOR THE OPERATION WHOLE OPERATION OF A SYSTEM. RIGHT -- THAT YOU KNOW IT MAY BE A IT'S GOING TO BE A COMBINATION SO. SAVE YOU COME INTO A COMMUNITY. THERE'S AN ISSUE YOU HAVE MAYBE A NUMBER FAILING SYSTEMS MAYBE THERE'S YOU KNOW TEN OR ELEVEN SYSTEMS WITHIN A GIVEN AREA. THE WORK THAT WOULD BE DONE IS WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONALIZATION FIRST AND FOREMOST YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU SO WHAT IS WHAT IS THE RATE PAYER BASE WITHIN THAT. WITHIN THAT THAT AREA SO YOU MAY THEN PACKAGE TOGETHER -- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAN -- THEY MAY THEN -- ALSO THEN IDENTIFY CAPITAL AND TO AND AND AND NOW IT IS DONE I I I I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT SORT OF OPERATION MAINTENANCE OR RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT I AND I KNOW MISTER CROW FOOT AND I WERE. TREMENDOUSLY WITH THE SIDE PART OF BILL WITH ANNEXING PART OF THE AREA IN -- WHAT YOU COULD PLACE WELL COST PLUS TREATMENT PLUS EVERYTHING ELSE? BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT THE THE NUMBERS THAT I WANT TO HEAR BACK ON TRACK OR HOW MUCH IT COST -- SMALL COMMUNITY SYSTEMS VERSUS LARGER SYSTEMS. ON YOU MENTIONED THE END ON A WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN THAT NUMBER IS A DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE THE COST PER PERSON IN THE STATE EXACTLY SO I LARGER LARGER SIDE OF LOVE TO SAY I I THINK SPECIALLY WITH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL COMING UP. THOSE NUMBERS IN THOSE ANSWERS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- YOU'D ALSO MENTIONED THE LA INFRASTRUCTURE -- IS AGED SO A COST ON WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND PROPORTIONATE WITH THEIR SYSTEMS ON FIXING THAT. AS WELL AS IF THERE'S A NUMBER OUT THERE ON THE COST TO CLEAN UP THE BLOOM THAT IS IN -- I IT WAS ALL WATER INTRUSION ALONG OUR COASTAL CITIES. AND THE COST OF DEALING WITH THAT AND IF ANY OF THIS FUNDING WOULD GO TO THE CLEAN DRINKING WATER ASPECT OF THAT FOR ANY OF THOSE CITIES THAT ARE DOING GROUND WATER. THAT ARE DOING THE SALT WATER INTRUSION AS WELL AS DEALING WITH THE CROWN SIX FACTORS FOR ANY. AREAS THAT ARE DONE WITH COLORADO RIVER WATER BECAUSE IT'S NATIONAL ECOLOGY FROM THOSE SYSTEMS -- ESPECIALLY. AND THE COACHELLA VALLEY AREA AND THOSE DEALS. AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION TO YOU IS DO WE HAVE ANY PROJECTIONS ON THE FERTILIZER TAX -- WHAT THAT MADE DO WITH A INFLATION ON FOOD PRICING? AS WELL AS WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR SOCIAL SECURITY NET AND PAYING FOR WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS IS FOOD STAMPS AND WHAT THE ADDITIONAL COST ON THE STATE WOULD BE. ON THAT SIDE DEALING WITH THAT INFLATION PRICE. AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE BASIC NUMBERS I'D LIKE TO SEE -- AS WE LOOK BECAUSE AGAIN MY MY LARGEST CONCERN IS I THEY HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME THINKING A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO COVER THE STATE STATEWIDE AND I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOMETHING. THAT'S GONNA PUT MORE INTO IT AND THEN ALL WE ALL KNOW. A HUGE PART OF THE GROUND WATER -- CLEAN UP IS DUE TO THE FACT OF THE DROUGHT THE DEPLETED WATER THAT'S DOWN THERE. AND WE HAVE TO DO GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WHICH WILL ADD TO THOSE BAY SANDS WHICH WILL DIE LIEU ANY TOXINS AND GET US TO WATER QUALITY STANDARDS THAT WE KNOW WE NEED. CHAU WOULD ANY OF THIS FUNDING ACTUALLY GO TOWARDS RECHARGE PROJECTS WHICH WE KNOW WOULD INCREASE -- THE QUALITY OF THE WATER THAT'S IN THE GROUND. IF I COULD ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I KNOW THAT'S A LOT YEAH NO IT'S BUT IT'S THERE AND THEY'RE HELPFUL QUESTIONS -- ON THE SECOND QUESTION REGARDING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OF OF OF THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN IN FERTILIZER FEE -- WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU AND WILL -- WORK WITH THAT CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FOOD AGRICULTURE JUST TO CHARACTERIZE ANY POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OF THAT INCREASE -- I WILL SAY TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION I WOULD JUST -- IDENTIFY FOR THE COMMITTEES -- THE FAIRLY A TECHNICAL ESTIMATE -- THAT -- WAS GENERATED LAST YEAR TO INFORM THE THE ESTIMATED COST OF ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WITHOUT -- SAFE DRINKING WATER THIS IS OBVIOUSLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE THAT TOPIC IS NOT BEEN -- FULLY TACKLE BEFORE AND A PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND SOLUTION IS HIGHLY LOCALIZED BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT A FAIRLY DETAILED METHODOLOGY -- WAS ESTABLISHED TO ESTIMATE THE COST -- SPECIFICALLY DOES -- SYSTEMS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY NAY TRADE ONLY POLLUTION -- THAT ARE IMPACTED BY NAY TRADE POLLUTION AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS OR OTHER CONTAMINANTS LÃ  IN THAT'S THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION WITH THE RECHARGE. BECAUSE AS WE KNOW A LOT OF THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE HIGH NITRATE CONTENT ARE ALSO AFFECTED FROM THE DROUGHT IN. THE AQUIFER'S OF DRUG SIGNIFICANTLY THERE AND I KNOW ONE OF THE VIABLE THINGS THAT'S BEEN USED IS TO CONVEY WATER DOWN TO THOSE AREAS A NEW SURFACE WATER IN LIEU OF GROUNDWATER. BUT WITH THAT IF WE HAVE OUR OWN CHALLENGES WITH CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS AND MAINTENANCE OF THOSE SYSTEMS. ON IN IN KEEPING THEM UP TO DATE UP TO STANDARD -- SO YOU KNOW IS THAT COST FACTORED IN ON MAINTAINING THOSE CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS AS WELL. UNDERSTOOD I WOULD JUST MAKE THREE FINAL POINTS ONE IS THE LEGISLATURE WISELY APPROPRIATED FUNDING FOR A MORE DETAILED NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT THE WATER BOARD IS IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING -- WHICH WILL. BE IMPORTANT -- AND THAT I'VE ACTUALLY JUST LET ME LET ME TAKE A MOMENT AS THE OTHER TWO POINTS WILL IN ON THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT WOULD WILL WE DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH YOUR OFFICE SO THAT YOU CAN. UNDERSTAND THE DATA SETS WE HAVE YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE ABLE TO CHARACTERIZE ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW AND TRY TO GET SOME YOUR ANSWERS TO THE NUMBERS AND AND I WOULD JUST MAKE TWO FINAL POINTS ONE IS AS I THINK THE SENATOR NOTED. ON THE CURRENT PROPOSAL -- THAT AT LEAST WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR. CAPS THE THAT CONSUMER SURCHARGE THAT -- IF IF THAT WERE ACTUALLY PASSED -- THAT THERE WOULD BE -- YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE AN ABILITY TO INCREASE THAT AFFECT THE COST OUT WENT UP BUT I WILL NOTE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IS THAT. SEVERAL HUNDRED OF THESE SYSTEMS -- I HAVE MAJOR ISSUES THAT CANNOT BE ADDRESSED WITHOUT A ON GOING FUNDING SOURCE. SO WE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW -- BEFORE AROUND TO IN TERMS OF REALLY TRYING TO GET PRECISE AND WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET PRECISE ON THE OVERALL ESTIMATE. WE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE PERFECT THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD IN OTHER WORDS WE KNOW WE HAVE TO GET TO WORK -- SOLVING THESE CHALLENGES AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY FOR TO DETERMINE QUIRKS -- JUST RAISING THIS QUESTION OF GENERAL FUND PART OF THE CHALLENGING NATURE OF THE OF THE NEED FOR I'M GOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. IS IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND AND I WOULD ARGUE PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND I'M GOING -- TO OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS IN THE SMALL COMMUNITIES WITH ONE TIME GENERAL FUND -- SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE OLOGY BUT YOU ONLY ARE FUNDED OFFER A YEAR OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A SERVICE CONTRACT WITH THE TECHNICAL PROVIDER. TO ACTUALLY OPERATE YOUR SYSTEM SO THAT REALLY IS THE NEED FOR THE ON GOING -- A FUNDING SOURCE MOLD AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY I'M LOOKING AT A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE ON GOING GENERAL FUND -- TIED IN WITH THE STATE CONSTITUTION GOING TO THE HUMAN RIGHT A WATER -- A AND I MEAN AGAIN THE INK THE BIGGER THING WITH WATER IT AS WE ALL KNOW WATER IS A VERY HOLISTIC SYSTEM ALL THE WAY FROM HEADWATERS. TO CONVEYANCE TO STORES TO RECHARGE TO CLEAN UP IN THE WHOLE LINE SO WE'VE GOT TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING WE TAKE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THAT. AND I UNDERSTAND WERE HYPER FOCUSED ON THE CLEAN WATER PART BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING THAT SHOULDN'T BE SUFFERING. AND THE AGAIN WITH THE SUSAN'S PASSION -- AND WE'RE SHE HEADQUARTERED RIGHT LIKE TWO BLOCKS FROM MY OFFICE SO WE TALKED A LOT -- AND PROBABLY SHOULD TOOK ON A LOT MORE BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THE PROCESS ON THIS. AND I EXPECT TO BE -- BECAUSE I'M NOT FULLY CONVINCED YET AND I'M SURE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE THERE AS WELL. THAT I I DON'T THINK THIS IS ENOUGH HELL OF A LOT BETTER. AND I THINK WE DESERVE IS IS WE TALKED WE MADE THIS A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. FOR OUR STATE AND I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY PUT SOMETHING IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION THAT THE FINES THAT THAT GUARANTEES AND LOCKS THE FUNDING IN THERE. SO THAT WE HAVE AN ON GOING FUNDING STREAM SO THERE ISN'T A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS ENOUGH. AND THEN WE CAN PRIORITIZE PROJECTS BASED ON THAT AND PRIORITIZE THE MAINTENANCE AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO ENSURE. THAT WE'RE NOT JUST DOING THIS TO TO ATTACK COLD ONE ASPECT OVER COVERING THE FULL WATER SYSTEM OF CALIFORNIA FOREVER FOR ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY I APPRECIATE -- THE INFORMATION I REALLY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST HAVE A COMMENT I DID A BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO -- DURING THE DROUGHT WHEN WE WERE WE WERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PORTERVILLE AND YOU KNOW THE WELLS AND THOUGH SO I TRIED IT THAT. TO ONE OF THE CRITICISMS I HAVE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT REGIONALIZATION WHICH WE NEED WE NEED TO TAKE THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND MAKE A SYSTEM THAT IS EFFICIENT THAT WORKS TOTALLY GET THAT. BUT I DID A BILL THAT TIME. ALLOWED TO DO AT THE SOURCE FILTRATION SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY RIGHT THEN PUT. IN THE LINE SOMETHING THAT FILTERS HE WAS A LITTLE HOW TO MADE AS WELL TRUST ME I WOULD LEARN HOW TO MADE IT'S A FILTER AT MY HOUSE IF IT MEANT MY KIDS GOT TO DRINK THE WATER THAT CAME OUT OF THE TAP SO. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL ALL THESE -- TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE THE COST DOWN -- AND SERVE MORE PEOPLE SO I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THAT SOMETHING THAT -- I ACTUALLY TRIED TO DO -- SEEMED LIKE A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO ME -- THAT WAY WE THE BILL DIED IN THE SENATE AND IT DIDN'T DIDN'T HAPPEN SO WOULD YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FAMILIES OUT THERE LEARN HOW. TO MAKE THIS A FILTER IF THEIR KIDS CAN DRINK GOOD WATER. MAYBE IN ONE OF A MEMBER. THE ONE WE CAN RESPOND ASSEMBLY MEMBER YES ABSOLUTELY THAT THAT THAT WE NEED WE NEED TO CONSIDER -- TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST PARTICULARLY DECENTRALIZED FILTRATION I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. AS I'VE HEARD THE CONVERSATION CHARACTERIZED ON THIS NOTION OF SORT OF DECENTRALIZED FILTRATION OR UNDER THE SINK FILTRATION. WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW FILTRATION -- TECHNOLOGY OR EQUIPMENT WAS PROVIDED -- SO YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WE'VE COME TO EXPECT IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS YOU KNOW THE RIPPED OUT THE WATER FLOWING OUT OF YOUR TAP IS SAFE AND CLEAN. AND WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO AVOID IS THAT YOU KNOW TO HOUSEHOLDS NEXT TO EACH OTHER -- YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY -- HAVE DIFFERENT QUALITY WATER -- SIMPLY BY YOU KNOW THE BEHAVIOR BUT WHAT YOU HAVE. IF I MAY IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF THESE. FOLKS WRONG WELLS IN THERE AND THAT SERVICING THAT HOUSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING A SYSTEM IS CUT AND IT'S IT'S SOMETIMES TENS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET OUT TO SERVICE THEM. YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COST AND GO CAN WE STILL AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS THAT SOME FILTERS DON'T WORK IN SOME I GET ALL THAT I I I HEARD IT ALL IN MY IN THE TESTIMONY WHEN I RAN THE BILL. BUT I KNOW I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THERE ARE SOME CONTENT IT'S WE CAN TAKE OUT RIGHT AT THE AT THE HOUSE AND THERE'S WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT IT'S IT'S A MATTER OF SOMEBODY NOT HAVING A DIRT BIRTH DEFECT BY HAVING CLEAN WATER THAT'S JUST COMMON SENSE. TO ME AND IT DRIVES ACOSTA -- SO I I KNOW YOU'LL TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION AND EITHER BE A LOT EXPERTS OUT THERE SAYING YOU KNOW WILL THE KIDS WHAT ACROSS THE STREET. AT IN THE DAY WE STILL NEED TO GET THOSE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TRY THAT COST DOWN AND GET GET CLEAN WATER AT THE SOURCE. I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY IMPORTANT TO ON THE TOOL SET AND I WOULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I THINK RECENTLY WE JUST CLARIFIED OUR POINT OF VIEW SOME POINT OF ENTRY -- TECHNOLOGY RAGS -- OR OR USE RAGS YOU THOUGHT IT SNOW WE NEED WE NEED THE SORT OF AN TRUMP -- TOOLS AND SOLUTIONS BECAUSE REALLY IT'S ABOUT ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT TAPE I CAN CLEAN DRINKING WATER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MAY JUST ADD TO THAT I I AGREE WITH THE CONVERSATION OF HAVING SHORT TERM OPTIONS. HOWEVER THE NEEDS TO BE TIED TO A LONG TERM SOLUTION I WILL SAY SOME AREAS -- HAVE SIX TIMES THE MCL FOR NITRATES SO WE DON'T HAVE A CERTIFIED FILTRATION DEVICE STEVEN OFFER THESE FAMILIES. AND YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF MAKING SURE YOU DO PROPER MAINTENANCE SO I IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS BUT WE HAVE TO TIE THAT TO LONG TERM STRATEGY. AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO IT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE'S NOTHING AND ANY OF THE LEGISLATION THAT I'VE SEEN OR PROPOSALS THAT I'VE. THAT I'VE SEEN THAT WOULD PRECLUDE -- A SPENDING MONEY IN THAT WAY -- THERE'S NO ONE SIZE I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL -- SOLUTION FOR EVERY COMMUNITY AND EVERY SYSTEM. HERE -- NEXT UP WE HAVE A DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU AND SHE DOESN'T NEED NAME BUT IT'S WHOSE ON I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WASN'T SUSAN -- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE MY THE GUY WAS ON THE PANEL AS WELL BUT THERE'S A BIT OF PRIDE IN WHAT OUR NAMES ARE AND WHERE WE COME FROM -- I DON'T WANT TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO CHANNEL AND TALK ABOUT RECHARGE AS WE LOOK AT 90% OF THE VALLEY WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON GROUND WATER WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH AS THE STATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUR MOST VITAL RESOURCE IN OUR SAFEST BANK ACCOUNT BLOWER GRANT. AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STOP ARGUING ABOUT FISH AND TAKE THE WATER THAT WE CAN AGREE SHOULD BE RECHARGED. AND START ME CHARGING SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT'S A LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT WE CAN HELP WITH SOME OF THE TO DILUTE SOME OF THE POLLUTION THAT CURRENTLY IS OCCURRING THAT NATURALLY. OCCURRING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. NOW IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT THIS IS IN MY BACKYARD LATER TODAY IM GOING TO MEET WITH. MEMBERS FROM LAND AIR AND FROM COME TO A CREEK AND FROM TOMBSTONE TERRITORY PLACES THAT ARE ON MY NECK OF THE WOODS PLACES THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD. BUT THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO I TOOK CARE OF IN MY PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. WHO OFTENTIMES COULDN'T STAY HEALTHY BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY WERE OR WERE NOT PUTTING INTO THEIR BODY? AND WHEN WE DON'T HAVE SAVE SOLUTIONS LIKE BEING PRESENTED BEFORE US. I WANT TO FIRST ASK ARE WE DEALING WITH IT LARGELY AND OFF. I WANT TO CONCURRENT THAT I WISH SENATOR MONNING HAD HERE LAST YEAR. BECAUSE WE'D BE A LOT FURTHER DOWNSTREAM AND DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. BUT ARE WE ADDRESSING ENOUGH RESOURCES TOWARDS THIS PROBLEM IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH. OR DO WE NEED TO COUPLE THAT WITH A LARGE ONE TIME INVESTMENT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DEAL WITH THE SEVERITY OF THIS PROBLEM. NOW I COME TO IT AS ONE OF THE BUDGET CHAIRS AND I KNOW I'M STEPPING OUT OF MY JURISDICTION. BUT ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE MULTITUDES OF PROPOSALS BEFORE US THAT ARE EXPENSIVE BUT IF WE CAN'T START WITH THE BASICS OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER AS A HUMAN RIGHT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S AWFULLY HARD FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN KEEP. HEALTH FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES A PRIORITY AS WELL. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION GETS US UP TO SPEED FAST ENOUGH OR WOULD A ONE TIME INVESTMENT IF THE LEGISLATURE WAS WILLING. HELP TO ASSIST IN ADDRESSING THE CRISIS THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE WE HAVE TODAY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER I'LL TAKE A SHOT -- AND JUST FIRST OF ALL ON GROUNDWATER RECHARGE I THINK THAT'S ARE ONE OF THOSE RARE ISSUES IN WATER POLICY WHERE EVERYONE AGREES LET'S CAPTURE AS MUCH OF THAT WINTER RAIN. GET INTO GROUNDWATER BASINS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE IMPACTS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS IS DOUBLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT -- I'LL SAY REGARDING THE COST ESTIMATE OF A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT THE SOLUTION IS IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE. THESE ARE OFF THE SHELF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECH IN A DEVELOPED AND REFINED OVER TIME AND COST IS COME DOWN -- SO IT'S NOT LIKE -- YOU KNOW FINDING A TECH YOU KNOW A TERRIBLY TECHNICALLY TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT YOU KNOW SOLUTION IN EVERY COMMUNITY IT'S SIMPLY BRINGING THE TECHNOLOGY IN AN OPERATING THE TECHNOLOGY. I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH A ONE TIME FUNDING IS AGAIN THAT I'M GOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE -- THE BONDS THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE HAVE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF ESTABLISHING ONE TIME FUNDING -- AS RECENTLY AS PROP SIXTY EIGHT IN JUNE -- WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS AT A LOOSE OF ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE? IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR A HYBRID OF THESE TWO SOLUTIONS AS WE GO THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS AND I'M JUST TRYING. AT SOME POINTS TO GAIN THE INFORMATION AND AND LOOK IT'S IT'S IT'S HARD WHEN WE HAVE THE SURPLUS THAT WE DO NOT TO WANT TO SPEND IT ON THINGS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENDING IT ON IN THE PAST. AND SOI THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WE COULD DO WITHIN ONE TIME WHILE ALSO LOOKING TOWARDS WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO HAVE THE SAFE AND RELIABLE ON GOING SPENDING THAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING AND SO. I JUST WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE IN MEMBERSHIP DOES THINK ABOUT A HYBRID MODEL THAT ALLOWS US. TO CONSIDER ALL OPTIONS BEFORE US SO THAT WE CAN GET A DEAL DONE THIS YEAR [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- IS PRESSES NEXT. I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT -- THE CHAIRS -- FOR BRINGING TO US EXPERTS THAT INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY. I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT -- WATER TALKING ABOUT CLEAN DRINKING WATER BEING A HUMAN RIGHT. THAT WE INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY KING THE WATER THAT IS NOT CLEAN AND DRINKABLE. SO -- SO SON ON THEM THAT. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE PART OF THIS PANEL AND THAT YOUR VOICE IS HERE REPRESENTING THE COMMUNITY AND I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT THE COMMUNITIES HERE IN BENITO SUBTLE SYSTEM THIS THANK YOU [inaudible] GARCIA. MY QUESTION IS IN REGARDS. TO HOW WE ANTICIPATE TO PRIORITIZE -- THE REGION'S SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEMS AND I KNOW THAT MAYBE HORSE BUT IF IF WE ARE LOOKING AT THE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY -- THAT WERE -- ATTEMPTING TO TO SECURE HERE -- WHETHER IT BE THROUGH MISTER BONDING STAFFORD TORY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT -- HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT PRIORITIZING -- THE PROBLEM [inaudible] THE IF YOU I WELL I'LL TAKE A FIRST CRACK YOU KNOW I THINK -- OBVIOUSLY THE SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE ARE KIND OF THE BLADE FROM BIG BLINKING RED DOTS BUT I THINK YOUR POINT. YOU KNOW THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT I THINK WILL HELP PROVIDE -- SORT OF A A SCAFFOLDING IF YOU WILL OF ASSESSING NEAR WHERE THE PRIORITY SHOULD BE AGAIN. SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE THAT'S EASY ONE BUT IT'S REALLY THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE OR CLOSE TO IT TO BEING OUT OF COMPLIANCE THAT ARE YOU KNOW ONE ONE PROBLEM THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO IDENTIFY. BEGIN TO ADDRESS PRIOR TO THEY GET THERE AND SO I THINK THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ON EARTH -- A LOT OF WHAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT MAY LOW OVERLAY DATA AND REALLY BEGIN TO ZERO IN ON ON WHERE EXACTLY IT IS THAT YOU NEED -- TO TO FOCUS IN ON PERSON OFF AND AGAIN THE OBVIOUS ARE ARE THE BIG SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE BUT AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT -- GOVERNOR BROWN THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORTED THE MOVE THAT THE MOVE OF THAT DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO THE WATER BOARD -- SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THAT WAS A HUGE STEP TO SORT OF BREAK DOWN FRAGMENTATION ON THIS ISSUE. I'M SO WE DO HAVE A DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER AT THE WATER BOARD AND DURING PAHLAVAS WHO LEADS THAT IS ACTUALLY HERE TODAY. SO -- IF HE'S AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT THAT QUESTION AND AND PART OF HIS JOB IS UNDERSTANDING SPECIFICALLY HOW WE PUT TO WORK THE RESOURCES THAT YOU PROVIDE. WILL IF YOU HAVE A BEER BRING THEM UP GREAT. HIGH OTHERWISE HE CAME. FOR THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING I'M DEBORAH AMOS DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION A DRINKING WATER IT STATE WATER BOARD -- TO QUESTION PRIORITIZATION IS IS ALWAYS A TRICKY -- ONE AS A FORMER RISK OF ALL SAID YOU KNOW WE WANT TO START WHERE WE KNOW THE WATER. SYSTEMS ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE AND AYE I THINK KIND OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART TO REALIZE IT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO FIND FISSIONS HIS FIRST. THIS FUNDING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO IS NOT ALL ON IN ADDITION OPERATION OF SYSTEMS NOW SO. A LOT OF THE EARLY WORK WE PLAN TO DO WILL GO INTO CONSOLIDATIONS. ARGAN MINISTRY -- IS TO TRY TO OF HELP SYSTEMS UNDERSTAND THEIR TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND REALLY GET A GRASP OF WHERE THAT'S AT AND THEN WE YOU KNOW PLANNED OVERTIME MORE FAT INTO THEN THE EXISTING PROBLEMS THAT STAND SO. IT'LL BE A MOVING TARGET AND THE BEAUTY OF THE OF THE DRINKING WATER BEING AT THE WATER BOARD I WAS IT DOES PRODUCE DISSIPATION DISCUSSIONS GET TO COME BEFORE THE BOARD IN A PUBLIC FORUM SO THAT WE GET TO ADJUST. ON THE FLY AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE ON IT AND I I REALIZE HOW OF COMPLICATE THIS COULD BE RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS ON THIS LIKE A COMPETITION OF WHO'S GOT THE DIRTIEST WATER WILL GO FIRST. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO AND THEN WE BEGIN TO INVEST IN THOSE AREAS. HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT INTO HOW AS WERE PRIORITIZING THESE AREAS WITH THE RED DOTS. HOW MONEY COMING FROM THOSE AREAS CAN GO BACK TO THOSE AREAS? GIVING BOTH RATE PAYERS -- WATER AGENCIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THE CERTAINTY RIGHT THAT MONEY'S GOING BACK TO THOSE REGIONS TO ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM I WILL. I WILL SAY OR GIVE THE COMPARISON. I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. THE TWELFTH AN INCREASE ON GASOLINE FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENTS -- SURVIVED IT'S YOU KNOW TEST IN NOVEMBER WAS BECAUSE THESE REGIONS OF THE STATE ARE. WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS IMMEDIATELY. RIGHT AND SO IS THERE. A THOUGHT BEHIND HOW WE IMMEDIATELY THESE INVESTMENTS TO THESE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE SEE THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE SENDING TO SACRAMENTO OR MAYBE NOT -- STAYING THERE LOCALLY TO ADDRESS -- THE CLEAN WATER ISSUES IN THEIR OWN. BACKYARD. WELL I'LL JUST SAY FIRST OF ALL OF THE SORT OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL I THINK GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT HE WELCOMES ALL THE IDEAS ON HOW WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AS LONG AS WE FOCUS ON SOLVING THE PROBLEM. SO -- CHAIR -- GARCIA'S I THINK YOUR IDENTIFYING IS THE POSSIBILITY OF ESSENTIALLY KIND OF REGIONAL LIES IN THE COLLECTION APPLICATIONS OF OF OF OF THESE FUNDS -- SO THAT -- FUNDING COLLECTED THROUGH FEE TAX IN ONE REGION'S OR TO STAYS IN THE REGION TO WORK ON CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS -- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE DELVED INTO IN GREAT DETAIL BUT IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS THAT WE SHOULD THINK THROW. I I ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE IN LAST YEAR'S DELIBERATIONS. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONCERN. RIGHT THAT THERE WAS A BIG FOCUS ON OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE CENTRAL AREA SALINAS VALLEY -- AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS THE WORD WAS BEING USED EQUITABLE WAY OF DISTRIBUTING THE RESOURCES TO THESE AREAS WHERE WE SEE THE RED DOTS -- WAS ONE FACTOR I THINK THAT GAVE PEOPLE SOME RESERVATIONS PARTICULARLY WATER AGENCIES -- WHO WERE BEING GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COLLECTING THIS MONEY SENDING IT UP AND MAYBE NEVER? SEEN IT AGAIN. I THINK THAT'S A FAIR POINT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN FUNDED BY STATEWIDE BONDS. WHERE WE'RE ESSENTIALLY INDICTING OURSELVES AND OUR KIDS -- TO FIND INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND SO IN TERMS OF THIS QUESTION OF RATE SHAFT JUST REST ASSURED THERE'S PLENTY OF FUNDING THAT'S GONE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR COACHELLA. TWO URBAN WATER DISTRICTS TO FIND IN THE FACILITIES ARE STORM WATER CAPTURE. SO I ALWAYS I ALWAYS CAUTION PEOPLE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL ON THIS QUESTION OF OF RATE SHIPPED UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING -- QUESTION MORE HOLISTICALLY WE GET WE GET IT. RIGHT -- WE HARDLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- ON THE GROUND. RIGHT IT'S WE WHO HAVE TO GO BACK AND SAY WE SUPPORTED THIS BECAUSE IT'S GONNA DO THAT. AND NOT. ULTIMATELY SEE THAT HAPPEN RIGHT SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF PUT THAT -- ON THE TABLE AND THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING OF MUCH INTEREST TO ME AND I DO ARE JUST OF KNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE THE NEED COMMITMENT FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM PORTER AVAILABLE IS ALSO. PUT FORWARD A CONCEPT. RIGHT A CONCEPT THAT REALLY TIES OUR HANDS TO THIS GUY. COMMITMENT WE'VE MADE TO THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IT WOULD GET. YOU KNOW IT'S DAY IN COURT AND AND AND REALLY BAD OUT THAT THE IDEA THAT IF WE'RE TRULY COMMITTED. THAT WE'RE MAKING A LONG TERM COMMITMENT AS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE X. AMOUNT OF MONEY EVERY SINGLE YEAR WHETHER IT'S THERE. OR NOT IT THERE IS A COMMITMENT THAT GOES TOWARDS FUNDING -- OUR PRIORITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A PRIORITY I MEAN GIVEN -- THE COMMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE THE COMMITMENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS MADE -- AND CLEARLY THE PARTICIPATION TODAY AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE IS SOME SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. TO VETTING THAT OUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. IT SURE QUIRK I THINK OF A FOLLOW UP YES -- SO MY CONCERN IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THESE STOCKS ARE. THIS IS A TRANSFER OF MONEY FROM THE URBAN AREAS TO THE RURAL AREAS IF YOU MAKE IT REGIONAL. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY MONEY FOR THE RURAL AREAS TO SPEAK UP. SO I THINK IT'S A TERRIBLE LIFE T. -- BECAUSE MY DISTRICT HAS NOTHING OUT OF COMPLIANCE NEITHER. I WILL SAY THIS. THERE IS A PROBLEM. JUST NORTH OF MY DISTRICT IN OAKLAND WITH LEAD PIPES WITH PIPE LED COMING FROM PIPES NONE OF THAT MONEY WOULD GO TO THAT. AND YET I'M WILLING TO BET THAT MR BONTA WHO REPRESENTS THAT DISTRICT WOULD BE WILLING TO TRANSFER THAT MONEY TO YOUR DISTRICT WHICH DOES HAVE THIS PROBLEM SO I JUST DON'T THINK THE REGIONALIZATION. WORKS AT ALL I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THAT ANY MONEY COMING OUT OF YOUR REGION WILL BE MORE THAN MATCHED WITH MONEY COMING OUT OF THE URBAN AREAS. AND I THINK YOU COULD SELL IT TO YOUR REGION'S FOR THAT PURPOSE THAT THIS IS BY AND LARGE THE URBAN RICHER AREAS SUBSIDIZING THE POOR OLD POOR RURAL AREAS. FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES AND I THINK WE CAN GET THE VOTES OUT OF THE URBAN AREAS. WELL I WILL NOT ARGUE WITH THE DOCTOR WELL. OKAY WE'RE WE'RE NOT GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A DEBATE -- SINCE THIS IS NOT A POLICY DISCUSSION TODAY. SOME THOUGHTS AND IDEAS THERE ARE GETTING LAID OUT ON THE ON THE TABLE HERE -- MISTER CRAWFORD DID YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING IN THE LAW WILL NOT. COME A QUESTION FROM I WON'T I WON'T DOT I WON'T ENTER THAT DEBATE BUT I WILL I JUST OBSERVE THAT. AS WE HONORAS I UNDERSTAND IT -- THIS FUND ACTUALLY WOULD BE ABLE TO BE USED FOR OUR DRINKING WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS IN URBAN AREAS INCLUDING LAD. I'M SO IT'S JUST REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND -- AND WE CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION JUST THE CHARACTER OF THESE PROBLEMS IN URBAN AREAS AND THE FACT THAT THIS -- THIS FIND ACTUALLY COULD HELP ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND WILL CLOSE OUT THE QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL -- WITH ONE FROM SENATOR MORE MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANEL MEMBERS. FOR YOUR ADDED EXPERTISE IN COMMITMENT -- I THINK MISTER CROW FOOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION THAT I HAD BUT JUST PUT IT BACK ON THE TABLE FOR MAYBE CLARIFICATION FROM. MISS DAN THIS WELL -- QUESTION OF RELYING ON THE GENERAL FUND -- AS EITHER AN ALTERNATIVE TO LOOKING TO RATE PAYERS OR AG FEES OR IN ADDITION -- TO MR CROWFOOT DID DESCRIBE THE IMPORTANCE OF PREDICTABILITY IN REVENUE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTRACTING FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AND I JUST WANT TO BE EXPLICIT. THAT. WE ARE WE HAVE A HELP THE GENERAL FUND IN A SURPLUS NOW. BUT I'LL REMIND YOU WERE NINE YEARS OUT IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM THE RECESSION IF YOU LOOK RETROSPECTIVELY. NO ECONOMIC GROWTH CARRIED HIS EVER EXCEEDED SEVEN YEARS FOR THE AVERAGE IS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS SO WE'RE TWO YEARS BEYOND THAT. AHEAD OF US WE DON'T KNOW WHEN. BUT WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THERE WILL BE A DIP. OR A DROP. IN THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE STRAPPED TO MAINTAIN ONGOING OBLIGATIONS TO EDUCATION TO HEALTHCARE. IT CETERA IN IF WE RELY UPON A GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION EACH YEAR TO MEET. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS IT'S IT'S TOO MUCH OF A CRAPSHOOT THAT'S WHY WE LOOK TO A GUARANTEED PREDICTABLE REVENUE SOURCE THAT REGARDLESS. OF ECONOMIC. EXIGENCIES IN OUR BUDGET WE STILL HAVE A PREDICTABLE SOURCE AND ALSO TO ADD ON TO WHAT MR CROWFOOT SAID -- WE USE BONTA MONEY FOR FOR CERTAIN CAPITAL PROJECTS AND WE PASS THE INTEREST PAYMENTS WE ALL PAY THE INTEREST ON THAT. THIS IS A DIRECT FUNDING SOURCE THAT. THE MONEY COMES IN GETS ALLOCATED AND SPENT IN WERE NOT INCURRING DEBT. IN THIS CURRENT STRUCTURE SO -- I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT AGAIN -- DOCTOR RUMBLE RAISE THE QUESTION MAY BE LOOKING AT SOME CAPITAL INFUSION. UP FRONT FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN ALL CREATIVE IDEAS BUT I I WILL CONTINUE TO ARGUE FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF A PREDICTABLE LONG TERM REVENUE SOURCE THAT'S NOT LINKED TO OUR GENERAL FUND AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT IF I BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR. ECHOES THAT -- PRIORITIZATION AS WELL IN EITHER MISTER CRAWFORD -- MISS DOWN AND IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT YEAH I'LL JUST SAY AT THE END OF THE DAY. WELL COLLECTIVELY FOCUSED ON SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND AS WE GO -- AS WE'VE GONE OUT THERE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOR THE FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED -- WHAT WE'VE UNDERSTOOD IS TO OPERATE AND MAKE AND MAINTAIN THIS TECHNOLOGY YOU YOU NEED I'M GOING FUNDING SOURCE AND IT WOULDN'T WORK TO HAVE A CHUNK HERE A CHUNK THERE SKIP A YEAR ANOTHER CHUNK THERE -- IF SOMEBODY CAN PROVE OTHERWISE -- THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD BECAUSE AND IF IT CAN WORK -- THAT WOULD BE OF COURSE EXCELLENT BUT ALL OF THE CONVERSATION THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO TO TO REALLY MAKE THAT CASE EFFECTIVELY. THANK YOU MISTY UNDID INTO THEM I WOULD ECHO THAT AS WELL I THINK THAT THE GENERAL FUND IS UNRELIABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE. AND TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE SOURCES PERMANENT. TO ENSURE THAT WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SO WE REALLY DO WE CAN RELY ON A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING TO ALLOW US TO HAVE THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED. IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER KALRA. I LIKE WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO NOW IS GO THROUGH ANOTHER ROUND OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE -- OF NOT THAT MUCH TIME LEFT TO HEAR THE THE NEXT THE NEXT PANEL -- FEEL QUESTIONS ON THAT PANEL AND THEN WE WANT TO GIVE THE PUBLIC AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK SO I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT TRYING TO CUT YOU OFF IN A JUST A THIRTY SECOND COMMENT -- ONE I I APPRECIATE YOUR GARCIA'S COMMENTS REGARDING -- GETTING RESULTS SOON -- IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WITH WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THEM WITH PAVING ROADS AND BUILDING BRIDGES YOU CAN SEE THAT MUCH MORE QUICKLY YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE THE WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DEALS WITH CLEAN WATER BUT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO SHOW RESULTS VERY QUICKLY. IF WE'RE GOING TO HOWEVER WE FIND IT AND THEN TO THE THE POINT IS A LOWER COURT OKAY EVEN IN SAN JOSE -- JUST LIKE OTHER IN AREAS LIKE OAKLAND AND EVEN LA IN SOME PARTS -- THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES WITH -- TOXICITY LEAD IN OUR WATER SO THE STAFF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO EACH OF OUR PANELISTS AND FOR ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AND I WILL NOW PASSED THE GAVEL OVER TO CHAIR QUIRK FOR THE NEXT BATTLE. SO FOR THE NEXT PANEL I WANT TO EMPHASIZE CHAIR BLOOMS COMMENT -- IT'S ELEVEN NOW AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO START PUBLIC COMMENT ANY LATER THAN NOON. SO AND A LOT OF THE MEMBERS OF BE LEAVING. PROBABLY BY NOON -- SHORTLY AFTER SO WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT OUR QUESTIONS AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. SO THE NEXT PANEL IS ABOUT MANAGING AN IMPLEMENTING SAFE DRINKING WATER -- WE FIRST WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM COST TO LOW ESTRADA -- BOARD VICE PRESIDENT -- CULTURALLY WITHOUT COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT -- CHAIR. GARCIA YOUR AREA -- CINDY PAULSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA URBAN WATER DISTRICT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHO YOU REPRESENT. AND THEN PAUL JONES GENERAL MANAGER EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT AND IF YOU COULD TELL US WHERE THAT IS WHEN YOU -- I INTRODUCE YOURSELVES. SO WE'RE GONNA FIRST HERE FROM OUR CASTILLO ESTRADA GOOD AFTERNOON. SO I JUST THE I WANT TO THANK A HALL OF YOU. FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU. HOW THIS ISSUE IS IS -- IMPACTING OUR REGION. AND HOW WE'VE BEEN OUT TRYING TO ADDRESS IT. FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS -- CAST LOW [inaudible] STYLER. I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT. I WORK AS A CIVIL ENGINEER. FOR THE KITCHEN WATER AUTHORITY. A PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. THAT PROVIDES WATER TO THE CITY OF COACHELLA. A CITY OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHAT I'M GONNA TRY TO DO HERE IS -- PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU. OF THIS ISSUE IN OUR REGION I THINK WHEN WE ALL HERE ABOUT THE COACHELLA VALLEY. SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE KIND OF PUT IN OUR MIND IS. THE MUSIC FESTIVAL. THE AMOUNT OF GOLF COURSES THAT WE HAVE TO RESORT LIFE. AND AND THAT'S A VERY REAL BUT WE ALSO HAVE A REAL VERY REAL -- WATER. ISSUE IN OUR REGION THAT I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T KNOW ABOUT SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA TRY TO PAY FOR YOU. TODAY. OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY IS MADE UP OF FIVE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT. OF THESE AGENCIES. COVERING MOST OF THE VALLEY FLOOR [inaudible] WITHOUT. THE SERVICE AREA OF OVER A THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. WE HAVE OVER JUST THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT HAS OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SERVICE CONNECTIONS. HALF OF THE HALF OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY [inaudible] IS RURAL. HALF OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY'S ARE NOT ON A CORPORATION. FULL OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS. THAT ARE TENDED. MAINLY BY FOLKS THAT LIVE WITHIN THESE THESE AGRICULTURAL FIELDS AND THIS IS REALLY THE AREA WHERE WE HAVE THE ISSUE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FOCUS ON TO UNDERSTAND THE COACHELLA VALLEY YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT A DRINKING PURPOSES [inaudible] IS GROUNDWATER. OUR WATER QUALITY VARIES ACROSS THE AQUIFER FLOOR. AND PRIMARILY WHERE WE HAVE A RACE USED ARE IN THE RURAL AREAS WHERE WE HAVE NATURALLY OCCURRING ARSENIC. NATURALLY OCCURRING FLUORIDE NATURALLY OCCURRING NITRATES. AND EVEN THOUGH THE CHROMIUM SIX ISSUE KIND OF HAS GONE AWAY FOR AWHILE NOW. BUT IF IT COMES BACK IT'LL BE ONE MORE ISSUE THAT WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- TO GIVE YOU SOME REFERENCE OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT OUR REGION. AND PROBABLY THROW MORE COMPLEXITY INTO THIS DISCUSSION OF AFFORDABILITY OF WATER. OUR AGENCY THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT WAS THE LARGEST AGENCY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WAS GOING TO BE IMPACTED FINANCIALLY BY THIS NEW MCL. THE COULD HAVE ANY WATER DISTRICT HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED WELLS. AND A THIRD OF THOSE LAWS ABOUT. THIRTY THREE AT HIGHER LEVELS THAN WHAT THE NEW MC OUT WAS PROPOSING SO THAT WAS YOU KNOW WE WERE PRETTY CLEAR PROJECTING THAT WE WE HAD TO IMPLEMENT -- SOME SORT OF PROJECT THAT WAS GONNA BE IN THE TUNE OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OF HOW. THE AFFORDABILITY QUESTION. WHAT WHAT WHAT CREATE ANOTHER ISSUE FOR OUR REGION BEING THAT? THAT THAT THAT THAT OUR REGION IS IS IS THE LARGEST AGENCY IMPACTED BY THIS NEWMAN SIAPA COMES BACK. BUT I THINK WE SAW A MAP HERE WITH -- WITH THE WATER SYSTEMS THAT WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE THOSE THOSE WERE THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS -- AGAIN THE COACHELLA VALLEY IS MADE UP OF FIVE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS BUT WE HAVE HUNDREDS. OF STATE SMALL SYSTEMS. THE FIVE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. ARE IN COMPLIANCE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. OUR ISSUES WITH THE STATE. SMALL WATER SYSTMS IF IF IF WE IF I HAD ANOTHER BOARD HERE. AND I COULD PUT IT. UP THERE IN ANYWAY JUST IT WOULD JUST FOCUS ON EASTER COACHELLA VALLEY YOU WOULD HAVE THE EXACT SAME NUMBER DOCTOR MORE. SPREAD OVER THAT AREA. OF ALL THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY -- FACING THIS ISSUE. SO THAT'S SOME SORT OF VISUAL THERE -- IN IN OUR REGION WE'VE BEEN WORKING OVER A DECADE NOW TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE FORMED IN OUR REGION -- IS PART OF THE IRWIN PROGRAM. A GOVERNING STRUCTURE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD KIND OF ADDRESS THESE ISSUES UNDER UNDER SOME SORT OF REGIONAL ASPECT -- ME IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL TOOL FOR US WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING SOME OF THAT GRANT FUNDING. ODD THROUGH THE IRWIN PROGRAM FIRST AND PROP FIFTY DENTAL PROPERTY FOR NOW TO PROP. ONE UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO MORE MONEY. THAT WE'RE GOING TO THE IRWIN PROGRAM. UP THE BOND I THINK THAT PASSED IN JUNE. HAS NO MORE MONEY ALLOCATED TO THAT PROGRAM AND THE BOND IT FAILED -- LAST TIME. EVEN IF IT PASSED OUT WITH THE CAT ANY MONEY ALLOCATED TO THAT PROGRAMS WHILE AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THAT'S BEEN A VERY SUSPECT SUCCESSFUL TO IN OUR REGION. BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT THAT DOT. THAT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED. AND AND IN OUR EFFORT TO TRY TO GET THESE THESE FUNDING SOURCES TO TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROP? ONE OR ALL THE OTHER PROPS THAT THAT PUTS MONEY INTO THESE DIFFERENT BUCKETS THERE'S A BUNCH OF COMPETING PRIORITIES. RIGHT AND SO. I THINK THAT EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROP. ONE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT. OF OF OF OF WHAT PROP ONE SAYS NEEDS TO GO TO DAX IS 10%. AND SO. THAT YOU KNOW IT. THERE ARE ALL THESE POTS OF MONEY BY. HOW THAT TRANSLATES INTO THE MONEY THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING DOWN TO TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IS VERY MINIMAL -- BECAUSE OF THE PRIORITY THAT I THINK IS GIVEN TO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS LIKE CONSERVATION. SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY GOOD CONCEPT THAT WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH WITH A COLLEAGUE AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE EFFORTS OF OF STORAGE RIGHT I THINK THERE WAS ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP ONE FOR STORAGE. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MONEY -- PUT ASIDE FOR CONSERVATION. AND OUR REGION I WOULD SAY THAT THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITORS IN OUR REGION BEING THAT WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF GOLF COURSES WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY GOLF COURSES. I WOULD SAY THAT A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT CAME OUT OF THOSE PROPOSITIONS PROP FIFTY PROP. SIXTY EIGHT PROP FIFTY EIGHTY FOUR AND PROP. ONE ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITORS FOR THAT IS IS CONSERVATION THAT COMES IN THE FORM OF OF TURF CONVERSION. A LOT OF THAT GOES TO THE GOLF COURSES. SO YOU KNOW THOSE I THINK WE GOTTA RETHINK THE ALREADY HERE SO -- I THINK THAT THE THAT THE OTHER ISSUE. IS ALSO THAT -- YOU KNOW I THINK WE HEAR THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. WELL THERE'S A READY THIS POT OF MONEY THAT I THINK THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS THAT SAID. THAT THERE'S THE STATE REVOLVING FUND LOAN THAT. THE STATE MATCHES IT COMES FROM THE EPA -- WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER BONDS THAT THAT SEEMS TO PUT MONEY INTO VARIOUS BUCKETS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. ARE BUT I THINK THAT THAT THAT IT'S REAL. OUR THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO CREATE A FUN. THAT GENERATES THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT'S NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHY SAY THAT. ARM. IN IN OUR REGION WE FORM WHAT'S CALLED THE THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE. AND TOP WHAT WE'VE DONE IS IS WE'VE BROUGHT EVERYBODY TOGETHER THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS OFFICE THE CONGRESSMAN'S OFFICE. THE SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE VARIOUS NONPROFITS LIKE BLUE NEEDLE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL -- BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES -- THE TREND LOCAL TRIBES THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THIS LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE EASTERN CHINA VALLEY AND EVERYBODY'S TRYING. TO WORK IN SILOS TO GET THEIR PORTION OF NICK WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE BECAUSE WE ON THE ACCESS TO WATER WITH THE YOU NEED FOR THE SCHOOL WHETHER YOU NEED BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD. ANOTHER ANOTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPLEX OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS. THERE'S A LACK OF PIPE AND SO I THINK WE WE FORMED THIS TASK FORCE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE DID IN THIS TASK FORCES WHICH WE DIDN'T A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AND WE WORK WITH THE COUNTY TO HELP US MAP ALL THE STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS IN EASTERN CHINA VALLEY AND THAT'S HOW WE HAVE THE NUMBER OF YOU KNOW OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM THAT ARE SCATTERED. AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE. REGULATED BY THE COUNTY THERE'S STILL MORE THAT ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE COUNTY. THAT THIS PROBABLY DOUBLED IN THAT. SO WE'RE NOT CAPTURING ALL OF A BUT HAVING SAID THAT UP THAT THE NUMBER THAT WE DID CAPTURE AND AND YOU HAVE TO HAND OUT THERE FRONT OF YOU -- WE MAPPED OUT ABOUT MAYBE EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DIFFERENT SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. AND WE LUMP THEM INTO INTO INTO ABOUT FORTY PROJECTS. AND THESE FORTY PROJECTS ARE CONSOLIDATING ANYWHERE FROM. TWO TO NINE OUR SMALL WATER SYSTEMS WITH ONE PIPELINE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE DID WE SAID OKAY WE'RE GONNA IT WE BUILD THIS PIPELINE HOW MANY OF THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS CAN WE CAN WE COMBINE CAN WE CONSOLIDATE AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN OUR EFFORT. AT THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IS IS TO CONSOLIDATE. ALL THE SMALL WATER SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN OUR APPROACH -- I DON'T THINK WE WE WE REALLY HAVE. A LOT OF ISSUES MAYBE WITH YOUR AND IF WE WERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT SITUATION SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROBABLY JUST TOO FAR AWAY TO THE CENTRALIZED. WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF -- LONGER TO IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW THAT UNDER THE SINK TYPE OF TREATMENT AND THOSE TYPE OF BOB MAYBE WHILE HIS TREATMENT SUCH. BUT DOT -- BUT OUT OF I JUST I I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS OUT OF THE OUT OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT WE TRADED THE THIRTY NINE PROJECTS. YOU KNOW WE'RE CALCULATING THAT THAT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ABOUT YOU KNOW SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO EXECUTE THE THIRTY NINE PROJECTS. AND AND THINKING ABOUT OUR HOW AGGRESSIVE WE'VE BEEN PURSUING GRANT FUNDING. FOR THE PAST DECADE. AND THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD IN IN IN SECURING THAT GRANDFATHER. I WOULD SAY THAT AT THE PACE THEY WERE GOING. IT TAKE US YOU KNOW ANOTHER FEW DECADES BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO EXECUTE ON ALL THOSE PROJECTS SO THAT JUST SHOWS ME. THAT THERE IS A LACK OF FUNDING. ATTRIBUTED. TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE -- AND AND I WOULD JUST AND I WOULD CALL THAT THE FIRST SPACE BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL PROBABLY SECOND PHASE BUT IT TAKE US FIFTY YEARS PROBABLY JUST AS THE FIRST SPACE. AND I THINK ARE. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DO FIND SOME SORT OF REVENUE STRUCTURE THAT THEY CREATES MORE FUNDING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES -- I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S QUITE ENOUGH. OFFER THE NEED THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. ARM AND SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE MY CAR I WANTED. TO PAINT THAT PICTURE -- I THINK THAT. IN IN OUR REGION I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE CASE IN OTHER REGIONS ARE ISSUES WITH THE STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. ARE IN OUR REGION I WOULD SAY THAT. ARE. IF THE MCL FOR THE CHROMIUM SIX IN INCOME BACK. OUR PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES WOULDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES. BUT WE STILL HAVE THE ISSUE WITH THE STATE'S SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. AGAIN OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM SCATTERED ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR -- RURAL AREAS -- FOLKS THAT LIVE WITHIN THE THE FARM FIELDS -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY WORK IN A LOT OF TIMES THESE ARE THE FOLKS. WHEN YOU LOOK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE COACHELLA VALLEY AND I SAID YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ONE SIDE OF THE VALLEY THAT'S RURAL AND AGRICULTURE AND IN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY IS GOLF COURSES IN? AND LANDSCAPE AND AND AND THE RESORT LIFE WHAT'S A LOT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S THOSE FOLKS. THEY GOAL WORK THERE. AND THEN THEY GO BACK TO WHERE THEY LIVE. AND THEY DON'T HAVE THESE TYPE OF AMENITIES RIGHT IN SO IT'S IT'S A BIG PROBLEM IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR FOR FOR INVITING ME HERE FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR STORY. AND AND I THINK THAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A STATEWIDE ISSUE INTO IN THE SOLUTION NEEDS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT EVERYBODY'S INCLUDED IN THE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING THIS PROBLEM REAL TO US -- MISS PAULSON. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS CINDY PAULSON I SERVICE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA URBAN WATER AGENCIES. MY BACKGROUND IS I HAVE A PHD IN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING HAVE BEEN PRACTICING IN THE WATER TECHNOLOGY IN POLICY AREAS FOR OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS -- A IS A NON ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION COMPRISED OF ELEVEN OF THE URBAN CALIFORNIA AGENCIES RANGING FROM THE SAN DIEGO LA. BAY AREA AND FRESNO AREAS. THE PURPOSE OF THAT ORGANIZATION IS TO INFORM AND HELP SHAPE WATER POLICY. WE'VE BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS -- HAS BEEN WORKING THE ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABLE ISSUES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. REALLY WANT TO HELP BRING SOME LEADERSHIP TO THE TABLE TO MAKE AN IMPACT WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE URBAN AGENCIES TO BE ENGAGED. IN THE SOLUTION. I'VE UP PROVIDED COPIES OF A BRIEF IN ISSUE BRIEF THERE ARE MORE DETAILS AVAILABLE ON THE COOL WEBSITE AT C0 DOT ORG IT'LL HIT SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS THEIR AS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED. THIS IS VERY MUCH A MULTIFACETED ISSUE -- IS FOCUS AND OUR STRENGTH REALLY IS TO DIG IN TO THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. SO WE HAVE LEVERAGE THE STATE'S HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER DATABASE AND OTHER STATE DATABASES TO LOOK AT SYSTEMS SMALL COMMUNITY SYSTEMS WITH WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM SO THAT WE CAN INFORM SOLUTIONS THAT WILL BE LASTING AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ARSENIC IS A CONTINUED PROBLEM TCP IS A NEW ONE ON THE HORIZON CHROME SIX IS PENDING -- ALONG WITH NITRATE AND SOME THE OTHER CONSTITUENTS WHICH ARE LESS PREVALENT IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY SYSTEMS THAN SAY IN THE DOMESTIC WELLS AREA SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF A SYSTEM YOU'RE LOOKING AT TURNS OF THE CONSTITUENTS. SO AGAIN WE'RE FOCUSED ON THOSE COMMUNITIES SYSTEMS. BY LOOKING AT THAT SUBSET OR INTENT IS TO TRY TO ADVANCE SOME EARLY PROGRESS AND ON THE GROUND IMPROVEMENTS. WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO ACT AS A CONVENER OF PARTNERS AND A CATALYST TO GET SOMETHING STARTED. ULTIMATELY OUR AIM IS TO GET OUT THE TECHNICAL ROOT CAUSES. OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THE PERSISTENTLY FAILING SYSTEMS BOTH THOSE THAT ARE EXISTING AND THOSE THAT WILL. CONTINUE TO FACE NEW CHALLENGES TAKE ACTIONS THAT WILL HELP TO BREAK THAT CYCLE. SO WE'VE LAID OUT THREE STEPS. TO HELP RESOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR THE FUTURE LONG TERM. THE FIRST IS TO IDENTIFY WHICH SYSTEMS WHERE TO BEGIN. AND I MENTIONED THAT WE LOOKED AT THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER DATABASE OUR ANALYSIS ACTUALLY INDICATES OVER THAT FIVE YEARS. THERE ARE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED SYSTEMS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS DURING THAT TIME FRAME SERVING A TOTAL OF NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AGAIN THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE FROM SIX THE LOWER LEVELS UNTIL WE GET TO THAT. ABOUT 14% OF THOSE SYSTEMS OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE ON A WHAT WE TURNED PERSISTENT BASIS. THE WAY WE LOOKED AT THAT WAS TWELVE VIOLATIONS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD COULD DRAW THAT THRESHOLD IN ANY PARTICULAR LOCATION. BUT WE FELT IT WAS HELPFUL TO REALLY LOOK AT THE PERSISTENCE TO HELP PRIORITIZE THE FOCUS. OF THOSE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SMALL COMMUNITY SYSTEMS NEARLY POPULATION IS FOUND WITHIN ONLY THIRTY THREE SYSTEMS. THOSE OF THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CONNECTIONS. OUR THOUGHT IS THAT THAT. IS A TANGIBLE PLACE TO START TO DO A LITTLE MORE OF THIS TECHNICAL WORK TO TRY TO CREATE SOME EARLY ACTIONS EARLY WINS SHOW WHAT WE CAN DO. LEARN AS WE GO. TEST AND REFINE SOME WORKABLE MODELS AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IN PARALLEL TO THE OTHER EFFORTS. WE'VE DEVELOPED A STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS FOR THE FUTURE. THAT IS THREE PRONGED TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES AN INSTITUTIONAL MODELS. WITH REGARD TO THE INSTITUTIONAL MODELS IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT SUSTAINABLY SIZED SYSTEMS THIS IS A NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS TO BE SUSTAINABLE. FOR THE LONG TERM AND PARTICULARLY WITH NEW CHALLENGES OF EMERGING CONTAMINANTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE. WE THINK THERE ARE HUGE ADVANTAGES WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND IN FACT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DO THIS IN A MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY IN A WAY THAT IS FUTURE LOOKING. THAT WILL ADDRESS THE COMBINATIONS OF CONSTITUENTS AND NOT JUST THE TRADITIONAL ONES THAT WE SEE IN PLACE NOW. THE ABILITY TO MONITOR WATER QUALITY REAL TIME. REMOTELY OPERATE THE SYSTEMS INTRODUCES WHOLE NEW OPERATIONAL MODELS THAT I THINK CAN HELP TO REALLY STREAMLINED OR SPREAD THE OWNER MONEY TO TO PROVIDE THE GREATEST BENEFIT. MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND MOST RELIABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLIES. FINALLY ENGAGED PARTNERSHIPS THERE IS SO MUCH INTEREST FROM MANY CORNERS. SO MANY ARE MOTIVATED TO HELP FIX THIS PROBLEM AND WE'VE BEEN STARTING TO INITIATE SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE FOLKS SO THE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS. WHO ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT WILL WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT TRAINS THAT WE COULD PROVIDE WITHIN PACKAGE SYSTEMS? THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR VERY QUICKLY. TO CREATE SOME OF THESE VERY NEAR TERM WINS AND THAT CAN BE READY TO DEAL WITH THE NEXT THINGS THAT COME ALONG INCLUDING CLOCK FROM. SIX UTILITIES YOU KNOW THEY'RE SET UP TO RUN REGIONAL SYSTEMS AND I THINK AGAIN. GETTING TO SUSTAINABLY SIZE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THE THE TECHNICAL WHERE WITH ALL TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. IN A SAFE AND RELIABLE MANNER. SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN HELPING [inaudible] UNIVERSITIES. ARE VERY PRODUCTIVE HERE A WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING IN PARTICULAR WITH MISTER THOMAS GUERRA A FRESNO STATE WHOSE -- SITTING IN THE ROOM -- AND HAS SOME GREAT IDEAS ABOUT THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. AND FINALLY FOUNDATIONS HAVE TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN HELPING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM RECOGNIZING THAT. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN THERE'S A BROADER NEEDS NATIONALLY AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD AS A STATE. IN SERVING IN A DEVELOPING A MODEL THAT CAN BE REPLICATED ELSEWHERE. THE THIRD STEP IN THE PROCESS REALLY IS TO PREVENT NEW UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS FROM FORMING. STOP THE BLEEDING LEGISLATION DEFINITELY HELPS TO ADDRESS THAT THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS THAT WE WILL -- YOU KNOW THE DOUBLES KIND OF IN THE DETAILS IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT ON THE GROUNDS TO BE SURE THAT THOSE SYSTEMS WE DON'T. HAVE NEW SYSTEMS ENTERING THAT ARE WILL. SO COOPER I MENTION CONTINUES OUR WORK -- WE ARE -- WORKING A FAST TRACK PROJECT RIGHT NOW WITH THE WATER RESEARCH FOUNDATION THIS IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PACIFIC INSTITUTE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO START TO DEVELOP SOME ANSWERS BY -- MID YEAR. THAT WORK INCLUDES SEVERAL ASPECTS ONE OF WHICH IS CONVENING A WORKSHOP OF POTENTIAL PARTNERS TO BRAINSTORM SOME OF THESE TECHNICAL APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS. REALLY WHAT COULD BE WHAT COULD WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR REALLY PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS. SITE VISITS TO GET OUT TO SOME OF THE AREAS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY HAVING SOME CHALLENGES AND AND THERE'S GREAT INTEREST IN BRINGING SOME OF THESE SKID MOUNTED SYSTEMS TO ACTUALLY TEST. THE ABILITY OF THEM TO TREAT THE SOURCES OF WATER. AND REALLY TO LOOK UP DIG IN A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMSOF THE THE THIRTY THREE THAT ARE LARGER. THAN TWO HUNDRED CONNECTIONS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE CASE STUDIES OF THE SMALLER SYSTEMS TO TRY TO DEVELOP MODELS. THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED AND EXTENDED TO OTHER AREAS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. IT WOULD ALSO BE SUPER HELPFUL TO HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF EXISTING FUNDS AND PERHAPS SOME MEANS. TO GET A MORE CREATIVE TO PEEL OUT SOME OF THAT FUNDING. TO ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE IDENTIFYING THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THAT FUNDING IS SUFFICIENT TO WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED. FOR LONGER TERM FUNDING SOURCES BUT WE KRISTIN FOR INFORMED THAT CONVERSATION OVER THE VERY NEAR TERM AND WE THINK IT'S TIME TO ACT. WE ALSO SEE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH STATE PARTNERS AND WITH NGOS WHO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CLOSELY OVER THE YEARS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. SO JUST IN CLOSING. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE THINK IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO START. OWNED BY REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEMS. FOR THE LONG TERM. SO THAT WE CAN CREATE SYSTEMS FOR THE FUTURE. THAT ARE ADAPTABLE TO THE EMERGING WATER QUALITY CHALLENGES THAT CAN BE OPERATED MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY AND RELIABLY. FOR A LASTING SOLUTION THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO BE COMING BACK AND TALKING ABOUT IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS FROM NOW REALLY WANT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR THE LONG TERM. WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD HERE IN FORGING NEW SOLUTIONS. FOR SAFE RELIABLE WATER FOR THE FUTURE. WE HAVE THE NATIONAL ATTENTION VERY MUCH ON THIS ISSUE CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET THE MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. TWO WOULD WEAR MUCH LIKE TO JOIN FORCES WITH YOU ALL AND PARTNERS TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISS PAULSON FOR WHERE YOUR TECHNICAL INSIGHT. AND YOUR SUGGESTION -- THAT WE COULD GET 280% OF THE PROP UP THE PEOPLE SUFFERING THESE PROBLEMS BY LOOKING AT A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF DISTRICTS SO I I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT INSIGHT -- MISTER JONES. THANK YOU CHAIRS GARCIA QUIRK IN BLOOM COMMITTEE AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY TOM PAUL JONES GENERAL MANAGER OF EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT AN AGENCY THAT PROVIDES WATER. WASTEWATER AND RECYCLE WATER SYSTEMS TO MOURN EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND ARE SERVICER IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY INCLUDE SEVEN CITIES A RURAL UNINCORPORATED COUNTY AN AGRICULTURAL AREAS WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE LIVING AND DISADVANTAGED OR SEVERELY AS AN ORGANIZATION EASTERN MUNICIPAL HAS SUCCESSFULLY FOCUSED ON PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS TO ENSURE ALL COMMUNITIES OUR SERVICE AREA RECEIVED SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE WATER AND SEWER SERVICE. AND WE HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH CONSOLIDATING AND REPAIRING SYSTEMS WITH FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SEVERE CONTAMINATION ISSUES. CALIFORNIA NATIVE ON THE WATER PROFESSIONAL WITH NEARLY THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN WATER AND ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES AND LIKE MANY OF MY WATER PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUES I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED. TO WORKING WITH THE STATE TO ADVANCE PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE FAILING WATER SYSTEMS WITH PERSISTENT DRINKING WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS INTO PROVIDE SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. BUT TO DO THIS I BELIEVE REALLY NEED TO ANALYZE AND UNDERSTAND THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS DIFFICULT PROBLEM. AND THEN TAKE A DUAL APPROACH THAT FOCUSES BOTH ON REFORMING THE GOVERNANCE AND FLOOD SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL OF SMALL FAILING COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS SIX SERVING CONTAMINATED WATER. AND ON TO DEVELOPING A RIGHT SIZE COMPLEMENTARY FUNDING PACKAGE WITH STABLE REVENUE SOURCES TO ASSIST WITH OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. CONSOLIDATION COSTS AN INTERN WATER SUPPLIES. DISPOSITIONAL IS ALL TALK ABOUT FURTHER WE'RE PROPOSING A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH WAS STATUTORILY ESTABLISHED PROCESSES GOALS AND TIMELINES FOR ASSESSING EACH OF THESE FAILING SYSTEMS. DETERMINING THE BEST PATH TO MEET THOSE COMMUNITIES WATER QUALITY NEEDS AND ULTIMATELY REACHING THE END GOAL OF ESTABLISHING VIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS WITH OPERATIONS AND REVENUE CAPABILITIES. IN DEVELOPING -- ANY EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO A COMPLEX PROBLEM IT'S REALLY VITALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE ROOT CAUSE SO I'D LIKE TO START OUT WITH AN EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD WITH A FEELING WATER SYSTEM. AND DISCUSS THE COMMON ROOT CAUSE ISSUES SHARED BY THAT SYSTEM IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR SYSTEMS IDENTIFIED WITH PERSISTENT DRINKING WATER VIOLATIONS. IN THE STATE BOARDS HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER DATABASE. THE COUNTY WATER COMPANY OF RIVERSIDE -- PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS SERVING A SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ADJACENT OUR SERVICE AREA SYSTEM HAD A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO CUSTOMERS A SINGLE WELL SERVING NITRATE CONTAMINATED WATER. INFRASTRUCTURE SO DEGRADED THAT THERE WAS NO FIRE PROTECTION FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE WATER IS ONLY AVAILABLE DURING CERTAIN TIMES OF DAY OUT OF THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM OWNERS IN CUSTOMERS LACK THE FINANCIAL RATE BASE AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND THE COMPANY WENT INTO FINANCIAL RECEIVERSHIP. ULTIMATELY THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT ASK YOU SIR MUNICIPAL IN OUR NEIGHBORING PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM TO PURSUE A SOLUTION INVOLVING ACQUIRING GRANT FUNDING PROVIDING TEMPORARY ABOVE GROUND PIPELINE TO REPLACE THE CONTAMINATED WELL SUPPLY. REBUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE CONNECTING TO OUR SYSTEMS AND THEN FINALLY DISSOLVING IN CONSOLIDATING INTO OUR DISTRICTS. DISHES WE EXPERIENCE WITH COUNTY WATER COMPANY ARE UNFORTUNATELY REPEATED OVER AND OVER IN OTHER NON COMPLIANT SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT LITTLE MORE DETAIL COUPLE THOSE ISSUE AREAS FOR YOU. FIRST OF THE CURRENT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR SYSTEMS IDENTIFIED AS NON COMPLIANT IN THE STATE'S DATABASE. 81% OF THOSE SYSTEMS SERVE LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA BASE AND STANISLAUS COUNTY FIFTEEN OF THE SEVENTEEN SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE SERVE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS. IN MONTEREY COUNTY ALL TWENTY TWO OF THE NON COMPLIANT SYSTEMS HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND SIR SERVICE CONNECTIONS WITH SO MUCH WITH SUCH SMALL RATE BASES. MANY OF THE SYSTEM STRUGGLE TO SUPPORT NORMAL OPERATIONS TO COVER BASS AND A COVER BASIC OVERHEAD EXPENSES SUCH AS MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING LEGAL FINANCIAL REPORTING WATER QUALITY TESTING INSURANCE. OFFICE SPACE ALL THE SIMILAR EXPENSES THAT ARE COMMON TO ALL OUR UTILITIES REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE IN ONE WATER QUALITY ISSUES OCCUR A WELL FAILS INFRASTRUCTURE FAILS. TRYING TO SPREAD THOSE EXTRAORDINARY COSTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS ARE LESS JUST BECOMES UNTENABLE. BUT THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE WITH THE LINEAR CAM. WE'RE SPREADING THE EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH ADDITIONAL COST OPERATE IN ARSENIC REMOVAL SYSTEM OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE SERVICE CONNECTIONS BECAUSE FINANCIAL INSOLVENCY OR THE MONTEREY PARK TRACK COMMUNITY SAID. SERVICE DISTRICT WERE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND REPLACEMENT WATER COSTS PURCHASE FROM THE CITY A SERIES ARE BEING SPREAD OVER FIFTY ONE SERVICE CONNECTIONS WITH HUGE IMPACTS ON RATES. IN SHORT FOR THESE VERY SMALL SYSTEMS IN MANY OTHER FEELING WATER SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE UTILITY BUSINESS ECONOMICS JUST REALLY DON'T WORK. SECOND IN EVALUATING THE FINANCIAL RECORDS FROM FORTY SYSTEMS RANGING IN SIZE FROM LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE TO OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND WE ALSO FOUND THAT MANY OF THE SMALLER SYSTEMS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THEIR RATES. THEY'RE BEING PAID BY THEIR CUSTOMERS GOING TO ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD THOSE CATEGORIES THAT I PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. FOR THE LARGE SYSTEMS WE SHOULD WE USUALLY SEE COST ABOUT 30% OR LESS OF OUR OPERATING BUDGET GOING TO OVERHEAD FOR THOSE SMALLER SYSTEMS WE OBSERVE OVERHEAD COSTS IN SOME CASES HIGH 60% OF BUDGET. ARE THAT SIXTY CENTS OUT OF EVERY CUSTOMER DOLLAR GOING TO BASIC OVERHEAD RATHER THAN CORE OPERATIONS AND WATER QUALITY NEEDS. THAT THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE REASONS SOME OF THESE VERY SMALL SYSTEMS CAN EXPERIENCE HIGH RATES. NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THERE ARE SMALL MANY SMALL SYSTEMS THAT ARE WELL RUN IN VIABLE BUT OUR CONCLUSION OF THIS IS TO BE MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. MODERNIZING THE SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL IN BY ELIMINATING NONVIABLE SYSTEMS WITH GOVERNANCE REFORMS INCLUDING CONSOLIDATION AND REGIONALIZATION IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MODEL OF HAVING HUNDREDS OF INDEPENDENT AND NOW STRUGGLING WATER SYSTEMS REALLY NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGED. EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IN THE CALFORNIA MENISCAL UTILITIES AGENTS ASSOCIATION ARE PARTNERING TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DO THIS THAT. THE PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE THE STATE BOARD ADDITIONAL STATUTORY TOOLS TO ADDRESS GOVERNANCE ISSUES AND REQUIRED A VALUATION AND DISPOSITION PROCESS. TO FIRST BRING NONCOMPLIANT SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE OPERATIONALLY IN FINANCIALLY VIABLE INTO COMPLIANCE THROUGH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WAR CONSOLIDATE THE NONVIABLE SYSTEMS WITH LARGER PUBLIC OR PC REGULATED HOST AGENCIES USING THE STATE BOARDS EXISTING STATUTORY AUTHORITIES. OR COMPLETELY DISSOLVE THE SINCE AND CREATE NEW REGIONAL ENTITIES WHAT WOULD BE CALLED STATE SMALL SYSTEM WATER AUTHORITIES AT A COUNTY OR A SUB COUNTY LEVEL AND PROVIDE ENHANCED TECHNICAL FINANCIAL MANAGERIAL COMPETENCIES. AND THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THE STATE BOARD WERE IN POWER BE IMPAIRED TO UNDERTAKE A SERIES OF SEQUENTIAL ACTIONS A POINT SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS AND COORDINATE WITH COUNTY LAUGHED GOES TO DEVELOP PLANS FOR SERVICE. TO FIGHT IT NEED NEEDED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND SUPPORT THE FORMATION OF THE LARGER MORE CONFIDENT SYSTEMS -- THIS WOULD ELIMINATE REDUNDANT OVERHEAD WHILE ALLOWING MORE EXISTING RATE PAYER REVENUE TO BE DEDICATED TO COURSE SYSTEM OPERATIONS. CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE ALSO BUILD TO THE PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE ACHIEVING THEIR WATER QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE MILESTONES. AND REPORTS BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED. THE SECOND PART OF THE DEAL APPROACH IS A PROPOSED FUNDING MEASURE THAT WOULD INCLUDE A STABLE AND RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE STATE BOARDS HOUSTON ADDRESSING COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO STATE DRINKING WATER IS STILL SEE ASIAN OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ARE SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION THEIR REPRESENTATIVES ARE HERE TODAY AND I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU IN PUBLIC COMMENT. IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS -- BUT THIS FUNDING LEGISLATION WOULD ESTABLISH AND STATE LAW A DRINKING WATER TRUST THE TRUST WOULD BE FUNDED WITH AN INITIAL INFUSION FROM THE STATE -- GENERAL FUND DURING A BUDGET SURPLUS YEARS SUCH AS THIS AND WOULD ESTABLISH A BENEFIT CHARITABLE TRUSTS IT'S OVERSEEN BY A SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST COMMISSION. THE TRUST PRINCIPLE WOULD BE INVESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIFOR FOR A PRUDENT INVESTOR ACT IN NET REVENUES FROM THOSE INTEREST EARNINGS WOULD BE AVAILABLE YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT FOR TRANSFER TO THE STATE DRINKING WATER FUN AT THE STATE. WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE TRUST EARNINGS ALONG WITH OTHER DESIGNATED RATHER REVENUE SOURCES WOULD YOU SIZE STATE BOARD OF FROM THE OPERATION MAINTENANCE COSTS CONSOLIDATION COSTS IN REPLACEMENT OF WATER COST. OF FOR THESE SYSTEMS AND ADDRESS THIS CONTAMINATION AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. WITH A FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FISCAL YEAR WE BELIEVE THERE'S REALLY AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY THIS YEAR TO ESTABLISH AND FUND THE TRUST. AND BY DOING SO GENERATE THOSE INTEREST EARNINGS THAT WOULD CREATE A PREDICTABLE AND RELIABLE REVENUE SOURCE THE COULD BE DEDICATED TO THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE BENEFIT OF A TRUST FUND BY GENERAL FUND VERSUS A PER METER WATER CHARGE IS THAT IT USES A PROGRESSIVE REVENUE SOURCE WERE HIGH INCOME. EARNERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED MUCH MORE AND LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ARE CONTRIBUTING MUST LESS THIS AVOIDS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON WHAT WE CALL OUR INCOME CHALLENGE RESIDENTS AND THOSE ARE THE ONES WHO WERE JUST ABOVE THAT 2100%. THRESHOLD OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL UNDER A WATER FEE PROPOSAL THOSE RESIDENTS SHOULD NOT ONLY BE PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT IS SOME OF OUR MOST AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND RESIDENTS WOULD ALSO BE ABSORBING SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THAT ALL THE WATER AGENCIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO OCCUR -- INKER TO IMPLEMENT COLLECTION OF THE PROPOSED FEE. IN SUMMARY WE BELIEVE THAT THOROUGH IMPLEMENTATION AND OF A TWO PART PACKAGE DESIGNED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ADDRESS UNDERLYING GOVERNANCE ISSUES OF THE FAILING WATER SYSTEM. COUPLED WITH A STABLE AND RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE IS CRITICAL TO RESOLVING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND FOR YOUR OPENNESS IN CONSIDERATION OF ALL IDEAS. TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THANK YOU MISTER JONES JUST ADD A LITTLE DETAIL TO HIS PROPOSAL -- WHAT I SAW FROM THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES DISTRICT WAS -- AMOUNT OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THE INTEREST OF WHICH WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR I WOULD GAS. DEPENDING UPON. WHAT'S YOUR BONDS -- YOU MIGHT INVEST IN IS THAT CORRECT IS THAT YOUR PROPOSAL THAT'S A OF CONCEPTUAL AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IN THE PROPOSAL BUT AGAIN IT'S REALLY. DEPENDENT ON HOW MUCH REVENUE IS THE GOAL TO BE GENERATED SO FOR EXAMPLE IF -- YOU PUT TWICE THAT AMOUNT IN DOLLARS AND YOU LOOKED AT THOSE INTEREST EARNING SAY BE AROUND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AGAIN BEAR IN MIND THE WAY IT TRUST WOULD WORK IN THAT REGARD IT WOULD BE AN INFUSION FROM THE GENERAL FUND INTO THE TRUST. THE TRUST WOULD BE -- IN THOSE ROOMS REVENUES WOULD BE INVESTED THEY DEVELOP INTEREST EARNINGS IN YOU'D HAVE A REVENUE TARGET. IN GOOD FISCAL TIMES YOU'D BE JET GENERATING INTEREST EARNINGS IN EXCESS OF THAT REVENUE TARGETS -- IN THAT MONEY WOULD REMAIN PORTION OF THE MANY WOULD REMAIN IN THE TRUST. DURING DIFFICULT TIMES IN LOWER -- IN FINANCIAL DOWNTURNS YOU MAY NOT BE GENERATING INTEREST EARNINGS BUT YOU WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY GENERATING THOSE INTEREST EARNINGS AND THEREBY CREATING A STABLE REVENUE SOURCE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE PROPOSAL. OKAY I I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO PUT A LOT MORE AND AND A HUNDRED AND ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN ORDER TO GET. SOMETHING LIKE THE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION THAT'S BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW BUT WE WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT -- SO I'M NOW LOOKING FOR QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. YES MISS GARCIA [inaudible] A THANK YOU. I WAS LIKE THE NUNS THE SINUS PASSION EARLIER -- AND I THINK THAT IT'S NOT PASSION IT'S TIME TO GO HOME ON A REGULAR BASIS TELLING PEOPLE ANY TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER. AND THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO AND TELLING THESE COMMUNITIES I THINK WE AS A LEGISLATURE ANY DETAILS COMMITTEES THAT THE THE SURF CLEAN WATER NOW. THESE OTHER ANY LONGER BUT I HOPE AS WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TWO FOLD AND MISTER JONES IS TALKING ABOUT A MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING ACTION IMMEDIATELY SO THESE FOLKS HAVE THE WATER THE THE SO THE SERVER. FOR US LOOKING AT GOVERNANCE ISSUE SO WE DON'T END UP IN THIS PROBLEM WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT EMERGING IN TEN MINUTES WHAT IS KARIM SIX THAT WE KNOW IS COMING. WE HAVE THAT P. F. AWAIS THE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH OR DO WE NEED TO ALLOW ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY IN THERE FOR THINGS THAT WERE NOT THINKING ABOUT BUT WILL BE EMERGING. DOWN THE ROAD BUT I DO HOPE THAT THAT WE COULD TAKE ACTION -- I LIVE IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. THAT HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WHEN WE HAVE ALLOCATED FUNDS IN WE HAVE MISSED OUT ON THE STANDS FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT RECENT SUCCESSES SET UP THOSE PLANS. HOPE WE'RE TALKING TO THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BOND DOLLARS FOR WHATEVER REASON EVEN THOUGH WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE. TO START WITH UNDER THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN. ANA INSIST MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- LOT OF QUESTIONS TO HAVE ONE NOW. BUT YOU KNOW I I LIKE THE TRUST IDEA THINK IT'S DEFINITELY VIABLE AND YOU KNOW A THING. THE CONCERNS ARE ALWAYS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY HOW HOW WE PUT INTO IT BUT TRUSTS WORK THEY'RE KNOWN TO WORK AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN A TAX. ALL RIGHT AND I'LL JUST SAY MY MY OF MY WRITTEN TAKEN MY HEAD SCISSORS THREE BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE TRUST BUT WE'LL SEE -- ANYONE ELSE WITH THE QUESTION. WELL I WANT TO THANK I'M VERY GLAD MISTER JONES YOU BROUGHT UP THAT PROPOSAL WHICH I I'VE HEARD BEFORE BUT MANY IN THE AUDIENCE OF NOT -- AND I WANT TO THANK THE MISS PAULSON FOR HER TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND I HOPE YOU WILL GET TO US -- AS MUCH OF A THAT REPORT TO OUR COMMITTEES -- FOR WERE WRAPPED WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE -- FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND FOR BUDGET SUB -- THREE AS MUCH OF THOSE REPORTS AS YOU CAN SO OUR STAFF CAN LOOK AT THEM. AND AGAIN MISTER STRADA -- GIVING US IN ON THE GROUND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES AND WHY THEY'RE SO DIFFICULT TO SOLVE -- I SEE A LARGE LINE. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS CLOSE TO A MINUTE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY PEOPLE UP HERE AND IT WOULD BE GREAT. TO HAVE SOME MEMBERS STILL HERE WHILE YOU'RE TALKING BESIDES ME -- SO PLEASE TRY TO KEEP TO ONE MINUTE -- PLEASE GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND TRY TO KEEP YOUR AND WE HAVE TRANSLATORS FOR THOSE SPEAKING SPANISH. I DID PLEASE TURN ON THE MICROPHONE [inaudible] GOING. THANK YOU THERE OKAY. CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIAWATER AGENCIES WE APPRECIATE THE HEARING THERE WERE SO MANY COMMENTS ON THAT SENATOR MOANING CAVE THAT WE AGREE WITH THERE'S A LOT OF AGREEMENT WE WANT TO GET THERE THIS YEAR. AS EVERYBODY HAS SAID THE ISSUE IS THE FUNDING SOURCE. SO AQUA INSEAM YOU A ARE SPONSORING THE LEGISLATION THAT MISTER JONES REFERRED TO IT WOULD CREATE THE C. TRICKING WATER TRUST IN IT WOULD CREATE IS THE TREE KING WATER FUN. THAT THE REVENUE FROM THE TRUST WOULD GO INTO AND THE STATE WATER BOARD WOULD IMPLEMENT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH ALL OF YOU ABOUT THE PROPOSAL AND WORKING IN GIVING TO A SOLUTION THIS YEAR. ON THE WE THINK THE TRUST IS A MUCH BETTER APPROACH THAN A STATEWIDE WATER TAX I WON'T GO INTO ALL THOSE REASONS TODAY. BUT WE URGE EVERYONE THAT'S HERE TO FOCUS ON THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE THAT'S ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES O A WATER TAX IT'S NOT JUST THE COST OF THE TAX THE ON THE ON LOCAL WATER BILL IT'S THE COST OF IN OVER. THREE THOUSAND LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS TAKE THE ADMINISTRATIVE STEPS TO IMPLEMENT WHEN YOU DO THE MATH THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. COKE THEY SKYROCKET IT'S HIGHLY INEFFICIENT WE THINK THE TRUST IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO DO IT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU I GAVE -- BLOCK FOR A LITTLE EXTRA TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE PRETENDING SOMETHING THAT I SUSPECT A LOT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY YOU LIKE VERY MUCH AND IF YOU CAN JUST SAY I REALLY LIKE THE PLAN. TRUST THAT WOULD BE GREAT -- PLEASE -- NEXT SPEAKER OKAY DANIELLE BLASTED WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ALL TAKE LESS THAN A MINUTE I PROMISE AND WE ARE DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO A SOLUTION AS WELL WE BELIEVE IT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT A STATEWIDE WATER TAX. WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THE GOVERNANCE SOLUTION WITH EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT AND THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE DIALOGUE TODAY WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DON GILBERT FOR ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT -- FOR MANY OTHER REASONS MENTIONED WE DO WE OPPOSE THE TAX WE SUPPORT THE TRUST -- COUPLE REAL QUICK POINTS THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. MISTER CHAIR WE DON'T THINK IS A REMOTELY RELIABLE NUMBERED THERE THERE IS NO THE WORK HAS NOT BEEN DONE AT ALL TO ARRIVE AT A RELIABLE NUMBER I THINK IT'S BEING DONE NOW I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL. WILL WILL REACH THAT CONCLUSION AND LASTLY -- THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE THE PURPOSE THE OTHER PROPOSAL THE TAX PROPOSAL BUT THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH DISCUSSION. ABOUT THE IMMUNITY IN THAT PROPOSAL FOR THE POLLUTERS WHO HELPED CREATE THIS PRO THIS PROBLEM. AND I THINK AND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S IMMUNITY FOR THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT BE EQUALLY AND FULLY VETTED AS WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A POLICY THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE WANTS TO PURSUE THANK YOU. I'LL JUST MENTION THAT -- MISTER MONEY DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT IN TERMS OF THE CONTRIBUTION FROM THE AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS YET JUST REAL BRIEFLY BUT IT. HAS BEEN A SUBJECT I THINK OF SOME MISINFORMATION THERE IS NO -- UNITY FOR AGRICULTURE -- TO PRODUCE SIX SETON SAYS THE REQUIREMENT IS THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THE REGIONAL WATER DISTRICTS -- BEST PRACTICES IN MOVING TOWARDS REDUCING. THE NITRATE RELIANCE IT IN ANY. THEY ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IF THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING THOSE BEST PRACTICES -- AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO MUNITY FROM CIVIL LIABILITY FOR ANY INJURY OR DEATH CAUSED BY CONTAMINANTS -- FROM FROM UNKNOWN APPROVAL SOURCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY -- WE HAVE -- A GUEST AT THE TABLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WOULD YOU GO AHEAD YES MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH -- MEMBERS MORNING DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE POINTS HERE. FIRST OF ALL WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED THIS MORNING IS NOT AT THE MINISTRY WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS A TAX WHICH SHOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. ESTABLISHING A TAX MEMBERS BEYOND BEING AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY WE'VE A SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND SURPLUS A NEW RECORD AMOUNT IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED IS USING A SMALL PORTION OF THE SURPLUS TO FIND A TRUST. THIS HAS THE BENEFIT OF SOLVING THE IMMEDIATE ONE TIME PROBLEM ALSO ALLOWING FUNDS FOR FUTURE YEARS TO SOLVE WHAT IS CARL A CLEAN WATER PROBLEM IN THE STATE WE THINK THIS. IS IN FACT A PERMANENT SOLUTION -- THERE IS PREDICTABLE TO SENATOR MUNNINGS PLANE IT ABSOLUTELY IS PREDICTABLE OVER TIME ONE TIME FUNDING. SELL WITH THAT ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE TRUST. THANK YOU FOR BEING BRIEF. OUR NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS JUDY CORAL RONO I'M ELECTED DIRECTOR BIGHORN DOES A FEW WATER AGENCY WHICH IS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR SARS DIVERSE FOR THE MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OF ORANGE COUNTY IN THE LOS VIRGINIS WATER DISTRICT. WHO DID A DE LOS PURCHASE IN A DEEP DIVE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DURING THE INTERIM WHAT THEY FOUND THOUGH THEY ARE A MODERN SYSTEM? THEY FOUND -- IMPLEMENTATION COST OF HAVE BEEN ADDED P. Y. APPROACHING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THEIR PROJECTED REVENUES FROM THE TAX COLLECTED AS IT WAS PROPOSED AT THE END WOULD BE AROUND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WE'RE LOOKING IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF AROUND DATABASE SECURITY ACCOUNTING. AUDITING AND THEN TRANS MIDDLE OF THESE TAXES DRIVE THESE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THROUGH THE ROOF SO THOROUGHLY IN SUPPORT OF THE INS BUT WE'RE GONNA WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ABOUT THE BEANS.
