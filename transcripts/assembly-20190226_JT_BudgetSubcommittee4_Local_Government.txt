TO BUY IT A FOR OUR OPENING STATEMENT PREPARED BUT COULD NOT BACK RIGHT NOW ALSO I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU -- FOR I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT HEARING I I WANT TO START BY REALLY THINKING THE GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF. FOR MAKING THE LARGEST GENERAL FUND -- PROPOSAL -- IN RECENT HISTORY AROUND HOUSING DURING THIS HOUSING CRISIS AND OF DOUBLES ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS LOOK FOR TAKE ANY MORE INFORMATION BUT CERTAINLY FOR ME MAKING SURE THAT. EVERY DOLLARS PUT TO BEST USE GIVEN THE CRISIS -- IT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT FACTS AND RESEARCH AND DATA ON THE GROUND OF WHAT WORKS IS WHAT I'LL BE INTERESTED IN BUT LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION. MR LAURIA JACK MOCAMA MISTER REAVIS. THANK YOU SIR. WHAT ONE ITEM NUMBER ISSUE NUMBER ONE GOVERNOR SHORT TERM PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS? GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DANIELLE BRANDON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ISSUE ONE IS THE GOVERNOR SHORT TERM PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. WHO WILL PROVIDE FUNDING TO PARTNER WITH AND INCENTIVIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO JUMP START HOUSING PRODUCTION? THESE RESOURCES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RESOURCES TO REACH NEW SHORT TERM GOALS BUT TO ALSO PUT THEM IN A BETTER POSITION TO MEET LONG TERM RINA GóMEZ. EIGHT CITY WILL STAB SHORT TERM STATEWIDE GOALS FOR NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION ACROSS ALL INCOME LEVELS AND WILL ALLOCATE THESE GOALS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THESE GOALS WILL INCLUDE ANNUAL TARGETS OF NEW HOMES STATEWIDE FOR TWO YEARS AND WE ALLOCATED TO EACH JURISDICTION IN AN OBJECTIVE CALCULATION THAT CONSIDERS FACTORS SUCH. AS EACH JURISDICTION SHARE OF THE COUNTIES HOUSEHOLDS JOB AVAILABILITY AND OVER PAYING LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. JURISDICTIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PLANS MEET THESE TARGETS WHAT IT. HOWEVER THEY MAY DEEM FIT WHAT WE ARE STILL WORKING TO FINALIZE THE TRAILER BILL I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN AT THIS TIME. FOR LL. BRING YOU LOWER WITH THE LA -- AS MISPRINT AN OUTLINE THERE'S KIND OF TWO MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR SHORT TERM HOUSING PRODUCTION PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS TO CREATE THESE NEW SHORT TERM HOUSING PRODUCTION TARGETS AND PROVIDE PLANNING. FUNDS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES TO PLAN TO MEET TO SET ASIDE A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR POT FOR INCENTIVE REWARDS. WE HAVE CONCERNS ON BOTH OF THESE PIECES OF OF THE PROPOSAL FIRST ON THE ON THE PART ABOUT CREATING SHORT TERM HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS -- WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS HAD A STRATEGY OF OF CREATING STATE DEFINED HOUSING TARGETS FOR COMMUNITIES AND ASKING IN THE PLAN FOR THEM FOR SEVERAL DECADES. THROUGH THE HOUSING ELEMENT AND REASON A HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION ARENA PROCESS -- AN ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND WORK BY OUR OFFICE HAS GENERALLY FOUND OF THAT THAT THAT THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN A STIMULATING HOUSING PRODUCTION. ON HELPING TO MAKE THIS A MEANINGFUL CHANGES TO LOCAL ZONING LAWS THAT FACILITATE A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT -- BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK IT WOULD BE THOSE SO YOUR WOULD BE BETTER OFF. NOT FOCUSING ON THE SHORT TERM GOALS BUT INSTEAD CONTINUING ON THE WORK IN THE EFFORTS IT'S BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. AND LOOKING FOR WAYS TO REFORM AND IMPROVE THE STATE'S EXISTING. STRUCTURE FOR LONG TERM PLANNING. ON THE FIVE IN A MILLION DOLLAR FOR INCENTIVE GRANTS. OF THE WE'VE WE THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE A A RISKY BET FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE THE STATE HAS TRIED A SIMILAR APPROACHES IN THE PAST OF SETTING ASIDE FUNDS. TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO TO BUILD HOUSING -- OUR REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THOSE PROGRAMS DIDN'T -- INCREASE -- AND SO THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T BE CERTAIN WHAT IT WOULD GET BY SETTING ASIDE THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. IT WOULD THEREFORE BE RISKY COMPARED TO ON ALTERNATIVE OF OF FOR EXAMPLE JUST ALLOCATING THE FUNDING FOR DIRECT SUBSIDIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. WITH THAT I'D TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS WE CAN MAKE MISTER. LITERATURE. GLORIA. NO I WANTED TO FOR TO MEMBER HASN'T TOTALLY AGE FIRST -- COUPE I. LOVE THE COMMITTEE WITH YOU. ON HOW TO IT SO THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE -- FOR SPONSORED LA AS COMMENTS. I WOULD SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE OVERALL TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT VARIOUS FACTORS OF HOUSING INCLUDING SHORT TERM GOALS LONG TERM GOALS. AND OTHER ASPECTS SUCH AS YOU KNOW THE AIR SPACE ISSUE IN THE C. QUESTION THAT WE'RE WORKING ON SO I WOULD SAY ONCE THE TRAILER BILL COMES OUT WOULD BE PROBABLY MORE -- READY TO ANSWER INMORE DETAIL SOTHE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS ARE GONNA BE IN THE TRAILER BILL. THAT AND CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT I MEAN FOR SOME WE GET OFF THE FROM START IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE IT ACTIVISTS GOVERNOR THE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT HOUSING I WANT TO MAKE ANY BONES ABOUT THAT -- AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH I WOULD IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF THE LA -- IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT ARE HERE ME FIVE MILLION TO FIFTY MILLION REAL MONEY -- BUT WE KNOW IN TERMS OF SIZE AND SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM -- YOU KNOW WE DID FIVE MILLION LAST YEAR RIGHT THE CRISIS IS NOT GOING. TO MAKE MY CONSTITUENTS HAPPY -- AND SO THE THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS I THINK I'M MOST MEANINGFUL IT'S DIFFICULT TO APPROVE. A THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS MAY BE ON THAT COULD BE A BRIDGE TO LONG TERM SOLUTIONS I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ALLUDING TO BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT THOSE ARE -- IT'S CONCERNING TO ME AS A LEGISLATOR. JUST. FOLLOWING UP Là MILESTONES WITH US ACTUALLY CURRENT. TWENTY NINETEEN I DON'T HAVE THAT TIME LINE RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THAT TIME LINE PIN DOWN YET. MISTER LOOK I'M SORRY MR. TO MISTER GORE THANK GOD GOT MUCH OF THE JUST A WHERE I WAS GOING DALY OWES -- RESPONSE TO THESE -- TO THIS PROPOSAL WAS WAS WAS PRETTY STARK -- AND I THINK MANY OF US CERTAINLY WANT LOCALS -- TO AS I THINK. TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO THE PLANNING THEY NEED TO DO. AND FRANKLY TO AFTER THIS YEAR NO LONGER HAVE THE EXCUSES THAT WE HAVEHEARD FROM THEM FOR MANY YEARS -- SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANSWERS ON A TWO A PORTION TO CITIES AND COUNTIES SURE AND WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THE PLANNING FINDINGS WILL BE PROVIDED BOTH DIRECTLY TO JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS TO ON A REGIONAL BASIS. TO ENCOURAGE ABOUT COLLABORATION -- AND THAT'S ABOUT AS MUCH DETAIL AS I HAVE AT THIS TIME SO AT THIS POINT BASED ON POPULATION SIZE SIZE THE HOUSING NEED OTHER FACTORS ANY OTHER FACTORS HERE WHERE OF COURSE OF FINALIZING THOSE METRICS OKAY AND THEN COULD YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT KIND OF MILESTONES. WILL PASS YOU FROM. THE TO UNDER FIFTY TO THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. STILL WORKING ON THOSE AS WELL AND SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE INCLUDED ARE I'M A HEARING TO SUM UP AS STANDARD STATE LAWS SUCH AS I HAVEN'T. THE COMPLETED AND CERTIFIED HOUSING ELEMENT PRODUCTION ENTITLEMENTS AND PROCESS FIX FEES WHAT I CAN SEE IS WHAT WE INTEND THAT THE BASIS OF THE A SENTENCE WILL BE BASED ON WHAT THE LOCALS CAN DO AND NOT. ISSUES OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL. OKAY WHAT WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF WHEN WE COULD EXPECT MORE DETAILS ON THIS I AM HESITANT TO SPEAK TO EXACT TIME I'M HOPING VERY SOON OKAY THANKS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YEAH -- I TO APPRECIATE ALEJO'S REPORT -- SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WE JUST THROW MONEY AT THINGS AND NOT REALLY THINK ABOUT THE ENTIRE. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES -- BUT I'M ANXIOUS TO FIND OUT THE WHAT ELSE IS WHAT KIND OF TIME FRAME AS YOU AND I OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS THEY BUT TIME FRIENDS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME ACCOUNTABILITY. THE DRAFT REPORT PERIODICALLY THOSE OF THE THINGS I WOULD BE LOOKING FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVE THESE KINDS OF THINGS -- FOR AND I ALWAYS AM CONCERNED THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT ARE SMALL CITIES A REAL COMMUNITIES GET THEIR THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE FUNDING THAT MAY GO OUT IN THE FUTURE. IF THE QUESTIONS WERE COMMITTEE. THIS TOTALING UP LET PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THE SIDE OF MISTER CHAIR MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TIM SHOT ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT DISTRICT -- BOARD HAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACRES OF DEVELOP A LAND THAT THEY OWN. AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DO YOU SING A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL OF TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS ON THAT PROPERTY WAS SEVEN THOUSAND OF THEM BEING AFFORDABLE. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE B. TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER -- TO WHICH GRANTS PART THE AUTHORITY TO REZONE ON THEIR LAND. THE END -- BART IS -- UNDERTAKING THAT RESPONSIBILITY NOW WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- IT IT IS A CHALLENGE WE HAVE ONE PLANNER AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF IN FACT YOU GO FORWARD WITH THE SHORT TERM PLANNING GRANTS. THAT YOU INCLUDE APPROPRIATE ELIGIBLE TRANSIT THAT IS IN FACT DEVELOPING HOUSING ON THEIR OWN HANDS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON BILL HIGGINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS AND WE REPRESENT THE TWENTY AM P. R. EIGHTEEN NPOS AN THE STATE REP REQUIRED THE THAT DO THE SYSTEM WILL COMMUNITY STRATEGY AND THE TWENTY COGS IN THE STATE THE DO RENA DISTRIBUTION. SO MY FIRST POINT ON THE RENEWED. WE HAVE YET TO FUND THE RENO DISTRIBUTION AND WE'VE ADDED. NEW REQUIREMENTS GOOD REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR HOUSING BUT IF WE WANT IT DONE RIGHT WE NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS. THE SECOND PART IS THAT WERE HAPPY TO PLAY A ROLE IN WHATEVER WAY WE CAN IN HELPING LOCATE THIS PLANNING MONEY IN THE AREAS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR GREENHOUSE GAS OBLIGATIONS. BECAUSE WHERE WE PUT THIS HOUSING MATTERS. IF WE STILL WANT TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND THIS IS A DIFFICULT BALANCE BECAUSE WERE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE ARE TRANSPORTATION AND OUR HOUSING GOALS ALL AT ONCE. SO -- WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO WORKING WITH THAT AND AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN EMPHASIZE AND PRIORITIZE AREAS. AND LOCATIONS THAT HELP ME AT ALL THREE GOALS WE THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST INVESTMENT FOR THE MONTH FOR THE FUNDS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY ON THIS ISSUE THANKS THANK YOU. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- WE ALSO LIKE THE COMMITTEE'S LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING MORE DETAILS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO BE EXCITED ABOUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT I'M WE DO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THE COMMITTEE IS HIGHLIGHTED -- WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED SB TO INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION OF THE FIRST YEAR FUNDING FOR UPDATING PLANS AND SO WE THINK ADDITIONAL PLANNING MONEY IS IS LIKELY HELPFUL -- ON THE SIDE OF THE FIVE AND AN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS I THINK IN COUNTY WORLD ESPECIALLY WHERE FOR FOLKS FACED A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATIONS WERE NOT NECESSARILY THE HOTTEST MARKETS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT. WE KIND OF THINK THERE'S A STEP MISSING BETWEEN PLANNING AND THEN HOUSING PRODUCTION ACTUALLY HAPPENING SO SOMETHING THAT WE'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH THE COMMITTEE AS THE BUDGET PROCESS ADVANCES. IS THE NEED FOR REALLY IMPLEMENTATION MONEY FOR THE PLANS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED SO WE CAN PLAN FOR HOUSING BUT IF THE HARD COSTS. ARE TOO HIGH IF THE MARKET ISN'T THERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR ISN'T GOING TO COME IN AND BUILD IT AND SO. AS IT RELATES TO UNINCORPORATED AREAS WE REALLY WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT GAP AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO BRING RESOURCES TO MAKE PROJECTS PENCIL THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAPPEN. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COMMITTEE AS THE CONVERSATION ADVANCES. THANK YOU. JEFF TURNER GEAR AN APPLICANT -- BERRIES ORGANIZATIONS KERA -- SHE WE SAY DOGFIGHT EQUITY. MY CONCERN IS ACCESSIBILITY MY CONCERN HERE IS IS ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR ASSISTING YOU IN GETTING NON PROFITS. BECAUSE AS OF TWO YEARS AGO YOU TRIED TO GETTING DOLLARS IN HERE AND HOW MANY OF THOSE DOLLARS HAVE YET MANAGE TO HIT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO YES AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT SHORT TERM WHERE THOSE FUNDS GET DIRECTED AT THE END OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE FACT THAT THE ON THE CRISIS. IN BEYOND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO FOR DEVELOPERS. IS MAKE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST THE TO GET BUILDINGS GOING NOW. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS. GOOD LOCAL PUBLIC COMMENT REMOVE ON UNDER. TO THE GOVERNOR'S LONG TERM STATEWIDE HOUSING PRODUCTION STRATEGY. IS THE PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO REVAMP THE CURRENT REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS THE RENO PROCESS WHICH DETERMINES THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF HOUSING REGIONS AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MUST PRODUCE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER STATE OFFICES AND WHAT STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION WILL DEVELOP NEW RINA PROCESS THE METHODOLOGY THAT ADDRESSES CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE. THE REVAMPED PROCESS WAS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED JURISDICTIONS TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR FAIR SHARE OF HOUSING BY LINKING TRANSPORTATION. AND OTHER NON HOUSING FUNDING TO HOUSING PRODUCTION WHERE YOU'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS WE ANTICIPATE THESE LONG TERM RINA GOALS WOULD NOT BEGIN FOR AT LEAST A FEW YEARS TO GIVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TIME. TO BE COMPLIANT WITH HOUSING LAW TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES AND MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS HOUSING GOALS BEFORE SUCH FUNDS ARE WITHHELD. AND I CAN ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME AGAIN. L. L.. WE AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT -- CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE -- THE STATE'S ARENA PROCESS IS WORTHWHILE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN SEVERAL OPTIONS ACTIONS IN THIS AREA IN RECENT YEARS -- THAT BEING SAID WE THINK THAT THERE ARE REMAIN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS -- AND WE OUTLINED SOME SUGGESTIONS AND ARE A RECENT REPORT WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON OUR WEBSITE -- HOPEFULLY ALL OF YOUR OFFICES OF RECEIVE COPIES OF A JUST QUICKLY SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE IDEAS IN THERE -- WE SUGGEST BETTER IN COURT INTO THE CALCULATION OF COMMUNITIES HOUSING GOALS LENGTHENING THE PLANNING HORIZON FROM EIGHT YEARS OR SOMETHING LONGER PERHAPS TWENTY YEARS -- FURTHER ENHANCING STATE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT OF HOUSING ELEMENTS PRINTING LOCAL IN USE RULES WORK COMMUNITIES ARE NOT FAITHFULLY PARTICIPATING IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS. AND ALTERING THE ALLOCATION OF LOCAL TAXES -- TO BETTER INCENTIVIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN FOR AND IMPROVE HOUSING -- WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO GET INTO ANY OF THE DETAILS ON THOSE -- SHOULD THE COMMITTEE WISH. TO SEARCH YOU. OUGHT TO THE TO FIND OUT SO DIRECTIONALLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF RE HOLLY RINA AND WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AND OTHERS WHO HAVE REALLY. MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORD -- TWO QUESTIONS ONE JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHEN TO EXPECT STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN AROUND RENO WHAT'S YOUR TIME FRAME FOR THAT. AND THEN THE OTHER BIG IDEA THAT YOU HAVE IN THE SECTION IS RUN HOW YOU TIE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING -- TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AND YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDS ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING ARE YOU LOOKING AT HOW DOES THAT GET TIED. WHAT'S TIME FROM FOR WHEN THAT PROPOSAL'S GONNA COME BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO THROUGH THE DETAILS ON THE STATE WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THE STAKEHOLDERS DISCUSSIONS -- SET THE BEST I CAN OFFER YOU ON THAT RESPONSE BUT WITH REGARD TO THE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS WE ARE CONSIDERING LINKING THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS FUNDS UNDER SB. ONE AS WELL AS OTHER TRANSPORTATION IN ON HOUSING FUNDS WHICH WE ARE STILL LOOKING INTO IT THIS TIME. AND LOCAL AGENCIES MAN ENOUGH THAT THEY WILL HAVE TIME TO WORK TOWARDS MEETING THEIR GOALS BEFORE THESE THAT. FUNDING IS WITH HEALTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] OKAY. I'M GOING OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT THIS TIME A WHEN WE SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. DESPITE WHAT COMMON. SURE. I'M TAKEN BACK RIGHT NOW. HOME BECAUSE OF GOING AFTER USING SB ONE FUNDING. IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE I'M JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. A WE WORK TOO HARD ON THAT AND TO ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE THAT THROUGH USED AS A POTENTIAL. IS DISTURBING TO ME SO I'M HOPING WE CAN WORK THINGS OUT AND FIND A DIFFERENT WAY BUT THAT ONE IS. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AS WE SIT HERE OFF LIMITS ON THEIR COMMENTS MADE THE VOTERS AND PROMISES MADE AND THAT WAS A VERY HEAVY LIFT LAST YEAR. AND THE VOTERS TO A CERTAIN EXPECTATION OF THOSE FUNDS BE USED FOR WAS PROMISED. IN OUT OF CHANGE THAT MID STREAM ROUGH ALLOW FOLKS WRONG. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS -- KICK POLEMIC CULTURE RISK PRISCILLA -- SO THAT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN KIND OF FLUID IN THERE WHERE I DIDN'T GET THE GRAVITY OF THAT. SO CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT YOU WERE SAYING WITH THE S. B. ONE FUNDS AND HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION. TRANSPORTATION. SURE AND WE ARE CONSIDERING LINKING THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROAD FUNDS UNDER SB ONE AS WELL AS OTHER TRANSPORTATION ON HOUSING DOLLARS WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET IDENTIFIED. TO MEETING THOSE HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IF THERE'S A HOUSING PROJECT TO THAT IS. CLOSE TO TRANSPORTATION LINES THEN THERE COULD BE MONEY TAKEN FROM SB ONE FOR THAT PROJECT. IS A WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE MECHANICS I DON'T KNOW THAT IT -- HOW SPECIFIC IT IS -- I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE HERE ON THE REPRESENTS TRANSPORTATION IF HE HAS ANYTHING BAD. PELOSI WELLS -- FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE -- THERE'S NOT THAT WE WOULDN'T LINK ANY OF THE S. ALL THE SP ONE FUNDING WOULD BE USED FOR THE PURPOSES THAT IS ALREADY STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO BE USED SO. THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS FUNDING WOULD STILL BE USED FOR THE SAME LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE NOW. BUT THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE -- WOULD THERE WOULD BE YOU KNOW THERE'S KERN -- STATUTORY FORMULAS FOR ALL THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED AND WE JUST PROPOSED TO LOOK AT IN ADDITION TO THOSE TOUCH WHAT FUNDS SOMETHING THAT IS LINKED TO THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING UNITS BUT FUNDS THEMSELVES WOULD STILL JUST BE FOR THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS PROCOPE. KILLING ME JUST ASK ONE MORE CLARIFICATION. JUST BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING THE THOUGHT PROCESS SO. THE THE MONEY THAT'S ALREADY ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL CITIES BY FOUR FORMULA WOULD CONTINUE TO BE -- GIVEN TO EACH CITY AS ALREADY THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO FOR MAJOR PROJECTS LIKE FREEWAYS AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MONEY WOULD GO TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOCATED. BUT THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER PART OF A POT OF MONEY IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT COULD BE GIVEN IF CITIES ARE. ACTUALLY MOVING TOWARDS TRANSPORTATION SLASH HOUSING. WILL THERE IS STILL A LOT OF THAT YOU KNOW DELIBERATION BACK AND FORTH OF ZACHARY HOW TO APPLY BUT THE IDEA IS THAT. CITIES THAT HAVE YOU KNOW THAT WHATEVER HOWEVER THE AMOUNT OF MONEY LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS THAT IS DETERMINED OR OTHER PROGRAMS I THERE'S LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS OR SEVERAL DIFFERENT SB ONE POTS. THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD STILL BE USED FOR THE SAME HIGH -- PROJECTS IN THE IN THE CASE ILLUSTRATES ROADS NOT HIGHWAY PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE. ESSENTIALLY -- IN A LOCAL PROJECTS OF STREET REPAIR THAT'S THE THING BUT THE THE FACTORS BY WHICH THE AMOUNT THAT IS -- CALCULATED OR THE THE FACTORS THAT CURRENT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE SCO STILL THE CURRENTLY PROCESSES. OF LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS FUNDING AND A HALF AND LOCALS MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS. AND SO -- THERE IS DELIBERATIONS ON HOW WE CAN INCLUDE REACHING -- LONG TERM OR MID TERM -- HOUSING GOALS AS PART OF THE US FOR TERROR [inaudible] THANK YOU. BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU -- I JUST WANT TO RECAP I'M NEW SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT RENO NUMBERS ARE PLANNING GOALS. AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REACHING THE PRODUCTION UNITS OF THOSE RECYCLES. AND YOU'RE TRYING SB ONE THE MONEY TO THE PRODUCTION WERE CITIES ARE ONLY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PLANNING FOR IT AND SO THERE'S A THERE'S A FLAW I THINK AND NOT LOGIC. BECAUSE I I CAN UNDERSTAND HOLDING BACK SB ONE MONEY IF THEY'RE NOT COMPLIANT WITH HDD I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE PRODUCTION GOALS AS ALSO PARTIALLY ON THE PRIVATE MARKET. AND SO CITIES CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MECHANISM THE PRIVATE MARKET. AND IT YOU YOU CORRECT AND WE WE ARE VERY YOU KNOW MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THAT THE I THINK THERE ARE GOALS THERE ARE PLANNING GOALS THERE ARE. THERE ARE. MULTIPLE DIFFERENT GOALS THAT COULD BE LOOKED AND AND DETERMINED -- WHETHER YOU KNOW GOOD FAITH PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TOWARDS HOUSING GOALS SO I THINK THAT THAT'S ALL PART OF THE LIBERATION THAT'S HAPPENING BEFORE. WE DECIDE ON ANY YOU KNOW FINAL NUMBERS ARE FINAL GOALS FOR WHAT WHAT IS GOING TO BE TALLIED TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW COMPLIANCE. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE ARE AWARE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN MEASURES AND ONLY CERTAIN MEASURES THAT LOCALS CAN DO TO AND SENT IT TO GET PRODUCTION. MOVING AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS IN THE CONTROL OF THE CITY SOME NOTE AND I'LL MAKE SURE THAT MAY I GO BACK AND DOUBLE CHECK THE FACTS OF MY STATEMENT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT IN A LOT OF CITIES WHERE HOUSING IS MORE DIFFICULT ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO HOUSING IS TRAFFIC CONGESTION. SO IF WE'RE TAKING AWAY THE SP ONE MONIES FOR LOCAL ROADS WERE BASICALLY TAKING AWAY CITIES ABILITY TO SOLVE CRAP TRAFFIC CONGESTION TO ACTUALLY CREATE THAT HOUSING THAT'S POSSIBLE SO LET'S BE VERY CAREFUL IN HOW WE APPROACH THIS. AND WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE CITY WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE MARKET THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA -- DC TENSIONER OF WHICH BUT THAT'S OKAY WERE REALLY THE PROCESS YOU'RE COLLECTING FEEDBACK AND I THINK IT'S GOOD LISTEN THE NEED TO BE SOME CARROTS AND STICKS IN THIS ARRANGEMENT WE CAN'T REPRESENTED EVERY CITIES A GOOD ACTOR WE KNOW SOME OF THEM AREN'T APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE. CITIES TO TO DO THE RIGHT THING -- I DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT SB ONE FUNDS -- GIVEN THE THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE VOTERS ON THIS AND AND STAYING. TRUE TO WHAT WAS REPRESENTED TO THEM ANYWHERE ELSE TO NOT BE MISAPPROPRIATED IS JUST A CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS WHEN GET IT. THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT I WOULD ASK ARE YOU EXPANDING THE POTS OF FUNDS BEYOND TRANSPORTATION FUNDS -- SPOKE WITH INCENTIVE GRANTS -- THAT IT KEPT TRADE FUNDS I MEAN ARE THERE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING AS INCENTIVES -- TO BE WITHHELD -- IF JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE ON HOUSING. RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE WE'RE LOOKING AT JUST. ALL OF THE FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE WHAT CAN BE TIGHTS WERE STILL VERY IN THE PRELIMINARY STAGES RIGHT NOW WE'VE IDENTIFIED SOME SB ONE FUNDS -- THAT'S ALL WE HAVE BLATANT BY OUR ENCOURAGED TO LOOK BEYOND THAT AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CARE IT'S AT THE STATE PROVIDES TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- AND I THINK THE ONES THAT ARE AT ENHANCING OR YOU KNOW OFTEN THESE FUNDS ARE USED TO HELP OFFSET THE THE IMPACTS OF DIVIDENDS DEVELOPMENT -- YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DOING THAT SHOULD PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST COMMUNITIES ARE NOT A SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN PUT TOGETHER A CANCER PROPOSAL IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT AND MAYBE THAT SIMPLISTIC OR MAY NOT EVEN FACTUAL BUT I I'D LIKE YOU LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION TO BE. INCLUSIVE OF THAT -- GIVEN THE POLITICAL [inaudible] YOUR QUESTIONS. OKAY WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. A GOOD AFTERNOON LUIS MONTANA BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA BE. FIGURE OUT THIS MIKE -- WE WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- ULTIMATELY HAVE -- SOME SOME SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FEEDBACK THOUGH -- ON THE ISSUE OF OF RENO TWO POINT NOW WE'RE A LITTLE BIT FOR A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL. THAT THAT'LL BE A SUCCESSFUL PROCESS ONE OF THE THE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH TRYING TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS. TO RENEW GOALS IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL CITIES ABOUT. TWENTY FIVE THAT ACTUALLY DO MEET ALL CATEGORIES OF THEIR VEHICLES THAT PROBABLY WOULD NOT. IN MOST PEOPLE'S MINDS SATISFY THAT THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND THAT'S JUST AN INHERENT FLAW OF ANYWAY THE STATE'S GOING TO ANY TOOL THE STATE'S GONNA HAVE. TO ANALYZE PRODUCTION BUT WE WOULDN'T WANT FOR BILL WHICH IS AFFIRMATIVELY DOING THE RIGHT THING BUT NOT MEETING. THEIR PMR RINA CATEGORIES TO BE PUNISHED FOR THAT -- WHILE OTHER CITIES THAT ARE MEETING THEIR PMR CATEGORIES BECAUSE THEY'RE PMR CATEGORY IS -- ZERO GET OFF SCOT FREE THAT THAT THE DIFFICULTY THAT WILL HAVE TO APPROACH. WE WOULD ALSO KIND OF HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FEEDBACK ON THE ON THE HOUSING DOLLARS TRYING TO HOUSING DOLLARS TO HOUSING GOALS. IN IN BIG PART BECAUSE WE WANT TO FOCUS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THOSE IN THOSE CITIES THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE HIGHEST OPPORTUNITY TO THE BEST SCHOOLS THE BEST NEIGHBORHOODS THE BEST AIR QUALITY. AND SO TYING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS -- TO MEETING STATE HOUSING GOALS COULD ACTUALLY CREATE THE WRONG INCENTIVE FOR CITIES THAT DON'T WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR COMMUNITY -- ENCOURAGING THEM ACTUALLY TO BE WORSE ON THEIR HOUSING GOALS -- BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T GET THAT HOUSE AND ALSO I THINK THERE'S NEW WANTS THEIR THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS IT IS IT WOULD IS RIGHT TO BE CONSIDERING THERE TOO PROPOSALS -- AND THE ASSEMBLY NOW THAT I THINK ARE ARE BOB VERY WORTH CONSIDERING -- FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DALY AND AND CARTY -- IT WOULDN'T MOST OF THAT MOST OF THESE PROPOSALS ONE ACTUALLY TAKE AWAY THE MONEY FROM THE CITY'S I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. IT WOULD PUT A LOT OF THE MONEY IN ESCROW AND THEN THE CITY WOULD GET IT BACK ONCE. THE REQUIREMENT WAS SATISFIED -- ONCE IT MET SOME OBJECTIVE STANDARD THAT THE STATE SET FOR IT AND SO THAT MONEY WOULD BE USED FOR THE PURPOSES. UNDER THAT SITUATION THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED ITS USE. OF FORCE SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S SOME I THINK THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME NEW ONES HERE APPRECIATE ALL THE THOUGHTFULNESS FROM ALL THAT. THE MEMBERS THE ASSEMBLY WHO ARE WORKING ON THIS AND AND PROPOSAL IN GENERAL BUT YOU KNOW IT KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THERE'S A PROCESS STILL HAPPEN THANKS. THANK YOU. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE COMMITTEE ABOUT SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES HERE WITH THIS CONCEPT OF USING. THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION AS SORT OF A DE FACTO PRODUCTION QUOTA -- WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY DO NOT INTEND TO HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. AND I THINK BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT USING OUR EXISTING RENO GOALS OR SOME FUTURE LONG TERM HOUSING PRODUCTION GOAL. AS A STANDARD AGAINST WHICH FUNDING IS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED WE HAVE TO BE VERY. COGNIZANT OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MARKETS THAT EXIST IN THE STATE THE FACT IS THE LA -- NOTED THAT THE EXISTING GOALS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ALLOCATED BASED ON MARKET DEMAND BUT BY DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS BASICALLY WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW WE WILL HAVE MORE -- ALLOCATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND WE HAVE TO BE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE LA -- AND OTHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT WE PLAN FOR MUCH MORE BELOW MARKET RATE HOUSING IN OUR LAND USE PLANS THEN THE STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL REALISTICALLY FIND AND SO UNLESS WE'RE GOING TO DRASTICALLY REDUCE. OUR PLANNING GOALS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'RE REALLY JUST SETTING UP JURISDICTIONS TO FAIL IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT AS THE YARDSTICK AGAINST WHICH THEIR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IS MEASURE -- SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOR A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND REALLY ASK RECOGNITION THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS IN HOUSING PRODUCTION THAT ARE NOT UNDER THE CONTROL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND CITY COUNCILS AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING. CHAPTER TO GEAR AGAIN ADVOCATE -- THESE [inaudible] TEN YEARS. YOU'RE NEEDING TO FOCUS A LOT LONGER PERIOD AND THE CONCEPT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEING BUILT FOR FORTY YEARS. LIKE WISE SEEMS TO ME THAT TO IN THESE CONSIDERATIONS I THINK THE LONG TERM IS SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED. TO BASICALLY. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A MARKETING TOOL AND AGAIN THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT RIGHT NOW -- THAT FOR THE NEXT DECADE YOU ARE GOING TO MEET THE INCREDIBLE SHORTAGE NEEDS THAT HAVE TAKEN MORE THAN TWO DECADES. TO CREATE THE SITUATION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] BUT THEN. I'M BILL HIGGINS WITH CAL CALLED AGAIN AND I'M MINDFUL OF THE FOUR O'CLOCK OR FOUR HOURS I'LL KEEP IT SHORT. OF YOU YOU'RE WELCOME -- I JUST WANTED TO SAY ABOUT THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM RINA GOAL -- RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND ABOUT TO GET THE FIRST ROUND OF RINA NUMBERS FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF PLANNING CYCLES. AND BASED ON THE WARMER ECONOMY. AND THE CHANGES THAT WE ALL AGREE TO AN SB EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT THE WINNER BILL LAST YEAR AND SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE I WAS SPEAKING TO A BAY AREA GROUP LAST NIGHT WHERE I TOLD THEM THAT THEIR RINA NUMBER THAT THEY SHOULD EXPECTED TO DOUBLE. AS A REGION BASED ON ALL OF THOSE FACTORS WE THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LOT. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SHORT AND LONG TERM IF YOU TAKE THOSE HIGHER ARENAS ARE. NUMBERS THAT WERE LIKELY TO GET THEIR STILL PROBABLY SHORT OF THE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS MENTIONED. SO THERE SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT GOAL IS AND IF THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL IS THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT AND THERE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE SOME RESOURCES ALIGNED WITH THAT. BUT SHORT AND LONG TERM RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHT YOUR TO TENURE ARENA CYCLE THAT WAS WAS HIS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. IS I KNOW THAT MY MEMBERS WHO WANT TO HELP OR STRUGGLING WITH WHAT THAT IS -- ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME WAYS THAT WE THINK WE CAN DO SOME SHORT TERM IDENTIFICATION OF SITES AND GET UNITS ON TOP. WILL HAPPY TO SHARE THAT AS WE GO FORWARD. THANK YOU. AND THAT'S WHERE ONE ITEM NUMBER -- THREE RESPONDING TO HOMELESSNESS. IT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE JURISDICTIONS ONE TIME FUNDS TO SUPPORT REGIONAL PLANNING. TO EXPAND OR DEVELOP SHELTERS FOR THE HOMELESS AND TO MEET MILESTONES TOWARDS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN EACH JURISDICTION WE ANTICIPATE THE FUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH THE FORTY THREE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND THIRTEEN MOST POPULOUS CITIES IN THE STATE. BASED ON THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HOMELESSNESS POINT IN TIME COUNT. JURISDICTIONS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO COOPERATE REGIONALLY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. WHILE WE ARE STILL FINALIZING THIS TRAVEL AS WELL I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN. WELL. THAT'S MORALIS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST INVESTING IN SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS SEEMS REASONABLE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT INVESTMENTS FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN. THE SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS COULD PROVIDE US IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR THESE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS RAMP UP. ON THE OTHER HAND TO THE FLEXIBLE FUN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- FOR FOR HOMELESSNESS -- ADVANCEMENTS IS A BIT RISKY SIMILAR TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID ON ITEM ONE IT'S JUST UNCLEAR HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL RESPOND AND WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE WILL SEE ITS INTENDED OUTCOMES. INTO THEIR ALTERNATE USES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE MOR CERTAIN BENEFITS FOR THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY IN THE STATE -- AND THEN FINALLY WILL JUST NOTE THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE SAID ON THE OTHER ITEMS AS WELL ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING WILL GO OUT WHAT ARE THE MILESTONE SIX CETERA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. QUESTION FINANCE LAST YEAR WITH THE HE PROGRAM FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THIS IS. LITTLE DIFFERENT ANIMAL AND WITH. MUCH NEED OBVIOUSLY HOME THIS IS THE BIG ISSUE IS CONCERNED AMONGST A LOT OF MEMBERS SO HOW WILL THIS BE DIFFERENT AND WE WE CAN MAKE SURE THE MONEY'S DOING WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. SHARE SAYS CAN THIS PROGRAM AND IT'S IT'S A NEW PROGRAM BE ADMINISTERED DIFFERENTLY FROM THE HEAT PROGRAM. WHICH IS THE HOUSING -- COORDINATING FINANCING COUNCILS ONLY -- FUNDED PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IN ADDITION MONITORING FOR THE HEAT PROGRAM IS ONGOING I'M AND SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO MIX THOSE FUNDS AND WE DO SEE THESE AS A DIFFERENT USE WEBER STILL I'M WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THOSE YEARS WE DO SEE THIS AS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM WITH. DIFFERENT TACK MILESTONES. BUT YOU. TO I WANT TO FOLLOW ON OUR MISTER COOPER'S COMMENT SO SO HEAP LAST YEAR WE HAD OUR HALF BILLION WE GOT ANOTHER HALF BILLION THIS YEAR ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PROGRAM. HOUSING CAN BE DIFFERENT. SET AND MIGHT CALL UP THE OTHER COLLEAGUE FROM THE HOUSING COORDINATING FINE FOR GENERAL PURPOSE WHERE AS THESE PROGRAM FUNDS WILL BE TARGETED MORE -- BALLER CONSIDERING THE USE SAYS WE KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE TARGETED TOWARDS SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYMORE AB ON THE HEAT PROGRAM. OF THIS IS GINNY PARTY FOOT I'M WITH THE HOMELESS CREATING FINANCING COUNCIL. OF THE HEAP FUNDS OF ALMOST ALL BEEN DISPERSED I THINK WE HAVE THREE MORE CEO SEES THAT ARE IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING THEIR FUNDS DISBURSED -- GENERALLY I CAN SAY THAT ABOUT CONTINUES OF CARE HAVE PROPOSED TO USE THOSE FUNDS ARE FOR SERVICES. FOR HOMELESSNESS AND ABOUT 34% ARE EARMARKED FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH CAN BE CAN INCLUDE SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS BUT CAN ALSO INCLUDE OTHER KINDS OF HOMELESSNESS -- IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN BELOW THAT THERE IS A ABOUT. 14% FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE EITHER DIRECT RENTAL SUBSIDIES OR SOME OTHER KIND OF STUFF. RENTAL SUPPORT AND THEN ABOUT 7% SET ASIDE FOR YOUTH HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE AND THEN ANOTHER 4% FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH IS LOWER THAN THE 5% ALLOWED. AND THEN FINALLY OTHER. IF I COULD JUST MAKE A FEW COMMENTS SO AGAIN WHAT WE'RE LEARNING TODAY AS WE HAD A PROGRAM LAST YEAR BIG CHUNK OF MONEY HASN'T BEEN ANALYZED AND WE'RE SETTING UP AN ENTIRELY NEW PROGRAM. YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND AS WELL SPENT I WOULD AGREE DIRECTIONALLY I WOULD ABSOLUTE SUPPORT THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING BEING SPENT. I THINK THE QUESTION IS AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE REAL EVIDENCE BASED DATABASE APPROACHES TO ENDING HOMELESSNESS AND I WOULD SUGGEST IN AND OF OF OF COURSE WE ALL WANT TO SUPPORT SHELTERS IN EDUCATION CENTERS -- BUT IF WHAT I'M HEARING IT MIGHT DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE SPENT FOR THOSE TWO PURPOSES AND NOT NECESSARILY FOR LONG TERM PERMANENT. SUPPORT OF HOUSING OPTIONS WERE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT. WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT SOLUTIONS. THOSE ARE THE TWO SOURCES ARE THE TWO I'M INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED HOWEVER WE ARE CONSIDERING OTHER -- INVESTMENTS AT THIS TIME -- AND SO THOSE WILL BE FORTHCOMING SO A GUEST IN SHORT NOTE RIGHT NOW THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO WE'VE IDENTIFIED BUT NOT THAT ONLY TWO WERE CONSIDERED. I THINK WHAT I WITH WOULD SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO TACKLE HOMELESSNESS AND JURISDICTIONS ALL OVER THE STATE OR SPENDING MONIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE'RE NOT HAVING THE IMPACT THAT WE WANT. I WILL USE MY OWN CITY AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WE'VE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR AND YET ARE HOMELESS NUMBERS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AND SO FOR ME. ENSURING THAT WHATEVER WE DO IS EVIDENCE BASED AND WITH THE GOAL OF RESULTING IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF SHELTERS INTO SUPPORT OF HOUSING INTO SUPPORT OF HOUSING SOLUTIONS THAT TO ME SHOULD BE. HOW WE WE THINK ABOUT THIS BUT OBVIOUSLY WE LOOK FOR DEBT TO SING WHAT YOU GUYS PRESENT AS FAR AS THIS PROGRAM [inaudible] WICKS. SIR JUST TO KIND OF PIGGY BACK ON THAT YOU KNOW I THINK. MANY OF US ARE LIVING THIS EVERY DAY RIGHT IN MY COUNTIES WE'VE HAD A 40% INCREASE IN ALMOST AS THE LAST TWO YEARS. I'M SURE MANY OF US HAVE GONE AND AND COME TO SOME OF THESE SHELTERS AND TALK TO FOLKS IN MEANS THAT YOU SEE ALONG THE FREEWAY UNDERNEATH FREEWAY OVERPASSES AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING -- AND I THINK ALL OF US ARE ARE REALLY. STRUGGLING HERE FOR SOLUTION AND I I LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT RESOURCES INTO IT I THINK WE ALL AGREE TO THAT BUT WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW I'M JURISDICTIONS ARE ARE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS MAKING YOU KNOW PERMITTING NEW SUPPORT OF HOUSING BUILDING THE GOT NOT NAVIGATION CENTERS CONSTRUCTING EMERGENCY SHELTERS. AND THEN THAT THE APART PIECE ABOUT LONG TERM PERMANENT SUPPORT OF HOUSING. WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH THOSE DETAILS. AND FOR FINANCE ON THE HE IT'S IT'S SOME POINT REPORT BACK ON THE MONEY ALLOCATED. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT I MEAN WE LIVED HERE. THE TOUGH BILLION DOLLARS SO. I WOULD BE HELPFUL. EIGHT MR GABRIEL. YEAH I JUST WANTED TO STRONGLY ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU I THINK HE'S SPOT ON HERE AND AND AND ALSO WHAT -- WOOD MISTER COOPER SAID YOU KNOW WE THIS IS THIS IS A SERIOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BOTH LAST YEAR WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED FOR THIS YEAR AND HAVING. METRICS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT EVIDENCE BASED -- THINGS THAT WE CAN SEE PER HE'S BEING SPENT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY IN IN THE RIGHT MANNER BECAUSE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS SAID YOU KNOW WE HEAR ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME IN THERE SO MUCH ENERGY AROUND THIS AROUND THE STATE -- IT IT REALLY IS A INCREDIBLE MORAL CHALLENGE FOR US IN AND IN ADDITION TO ECONOMIC CHALLENGE AND SO TO SEE THAT WE SPEND HALF A BILLION DOLLARS ON ONE THING AND THEN TO IMMEDIATELY TRANSITION TO SOMETHING ELSE WITHOUT METRICS WITHOUT BEING SURE ABOUT. DEFECTIVE SET OUT OF THAT HOW THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT ON IS IS IS A LITTLE GIVES US A LITTLE BIT A PAUSE AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THE GOVERNOR WHAT OTHER -- INVESTMENTS YOU'RE GONNA MAKE BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE FOLKS ARE GONNA PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO AND SO I REALLY WANT TO ECHO WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU SAID ABOUT THE THIS QUIRK SILVA -- THANK YOU FOR THE WORK I A. B. RELATED TO HE FUNDS I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON I'M QUITE A BIT AND I CAN SAY FOR MY CITIES -- WE HAVE HAD SOME OF OUR CITY'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HEAP FUNDS AS A MATTER OF FACT IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY WHICH IS A PRETTY TOUGH AREA. TO GET -- TO I THINK OUR LOCAL ELECTED INVESTED IN PURSUING STATE FUNDING THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN -- A TOUGH -- I THINK ARGUMENT FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY GO TO THE STATE AND SAY WE REALLY DO HAVE AN EMERGENCY AND THEY DID ACTUALLY DO THAT AND I BELIEVE RE RECEIVED ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS NOW. BEING USED IN THE END WHAT THEY CALL THE NORTH COUNTY SPOT AREA SO SPA NOT LIKE SPOCK WHAT WE MIGHT THINK BUT SPA LIKE SERVICE PROVIDER AREA. AND I THINK WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING AND IS TO SEE FROM WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE AT THE STATE DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH THE CONSTITUENTS SO. AGREEMENT WAS MADE THAT FULLER TEN WOULD GIVE MONEY TO PLACENTIA FOR AN EMERGENCY SHELTER AND A BOY IN A PARK FOR AN EMERGENCY SHELTER -- BUT RIGHT AWAY AS YOU MIGHT SUSPECT THE WATER PARK PEOPLE WERE LIKE HEY WHY IS FULLER TO GETTING OFF THE HOOK AND THE TRUTH IS FULLER CHEN AS HAD AN ARMORY FOR THIRTY YEARS. SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE THIS IS YOUR TURN AND THEN PLACENTIA IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT QUIET. BUT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING HAVING TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE SEE A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES GO THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS. OF EVERYBODY LIKES THE IDEA EVERYBODY WANTS THE FUNDS BUT WE JUST DON'T WANT RIGHT THERE THERE'S A BETTER LOCATION SO THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE AT RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT STORY. BUT I THINK WHAT IS ENCOURAGING IS. IT HASN'T JUST BEEN FROM THE LOCAL TO THE STATE IT'S ALSO A FEDERAL JUDGE IN ORANGE COUNTY JUDGE DAVID CARTER IN ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES -- IT SHOULD GET TO KNOW WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE IS DOING BECAUSE HE IS THE GAME CHANGER IN ORANGE COUNTY. TO SOMETIMES USING A CARROT BUT EVEN MORE I HAMMER RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE SITUATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN ORANGE COUNTY IS. JUST UNCONSCIONABLE IN ADDITION TO SO HE FINALLY SAID ALMOST A YEAR AGO WE ARE CLEARING THIS RIVER BANK. AND THAT WAS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE JUST TO CLEAR THEM. TOO SO WE KNOW THAT THEY ENDED UP IN DIFFERENT CITIES AND MAYBE ORIGINALLY WHERE EVER THEY WERE FROM BUT NOW HE'S WORKED IN THE SPOT AREAS NORTH. CENTRAL AND SOUTH IN IS REALLY HAS COMMITMENTS EXCEPT FOR THE SOUTHPAW WHICH IS OUR BEACH CITIES IS SAY NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. ANNE'S SAID FINE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT THEN HE'S NOT GOING TO FORCE OVERNIGHT CAMPING SO FOR ALL OF YOU I HOPE YOU LOOK AT BECAUSE NOW HE'S ALSO WORKING WITH THE HEALTH AGENCIES. TO SAY WHY DID TO OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY PEOPLE DIE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND HE HAS BROUGHT IN SOME OF THE HEALTH PARTNERS TO SAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND WHAT YOUR ROLE. SO I ONLY SAY THIS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO UP TEAR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT AS A AS A TEACHER SEEN FAMILIES BEING DISPLACED. AND ONE PERSON WITH OTHERS WILLING CAN MAKE THESE DIFFERENCES BUT IT HAS TO BE. LIKE MOST OF OUR LOOK LOCALS DON'T LIKE CALLING THE CITIES TO STAY AND SAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET OUT OF THIS WHAT WHERE IS YOUR SOLUTION. FOR EACH ONE AND OF COURSE MONEY BACK TO BACK IT UP BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF THE IT'S HE FOR FUTURE FUNDING. AND THEY'RE FORCED TO USE THAT WE WILL SEE SOME RESOLUTION. IN THE COMMENTS MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU SKIPPER -- SO I WANT TO CLARIFY I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT HEAP IS ONE TIME ONLY GOING AWAY SAID THIS ISN'T IT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. IS IN THE SAME SPACE BUT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. IT'S NOT AUGMENTING ITS REPLACING. TO DO. BUT WITH DIFFERENT GUIDELINES KEEP KEEP WAS ONE TIME FLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING THAT'S CORRECT AND AS I MENTIONED WE'RE JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE FRONT THAT FUNDING THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION HAS BEEN DISPERSED. AND SO THIS WOULD BE A NEW CHANNEL YEAH SOME I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT WE ARE MAINTAINING STATUS QUO IN TERMS OF BUDGET. FORTY FIVE MILLION LAST YEAR FIVE MILLION THIS YEAR -- IN THAT AND SOME WAYS MAY SEEM OUT OF SORTS TO ALL OF US WHO HEARALL THE TIME FOR MARKETS TO HELP SET THEY ARE ABOUT THIS AND WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO. YOU KNOW FROM A LEVEL FUNDING STANDPOINT THAT HAS A BIG CONCERN BUT AGAIN APPRECIATE THAT IS ACTUALLY IN THERE THAT IS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING IT YOU KNOW IT'S ARE YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN TALK ABOUT DOMINANCE. I WANTED TO ASSOCIATE -- I WANTED -- TO TO YOU TALKED ABOUT -- THAT NAVIGATION CENTERS IN SHELTERS ARE ALLOWED BUT THERE ARE OTHER. YOU YOU GET SPECIFIC NUMBERS FOR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO DO THIS PROGRAM UNDER HEAT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY WHAT ABOUT DID THESE FUNDS THESE THAT THE FY. NINETY TWO TWENTY SO RIGHT NOW WE'VE IDENTIFIED EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS BUT WE ARE STILL CONSIDERING OTHER POTENTIALLY I WOULD ASK YOU NOT TO CONSIDER BUT TO DO -- BEYOND THAT -- WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A MERCY SHELTER THEY ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THERE GRADUATING LESS THAN 20% OF THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE SHELL THE THESE TENTS -- INTO HOUSING AND THE REASON THEY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT PUT RIGHT SO THEY GET OFF THE STREETS THAT DEMONA CLARITY TO GET UP THE STREETS THEY GET THE TENT -- AND THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO -- WE ARE CURRENTLY USING PROBABLY SOME HEAT FUNNY I'M NOT I'M NOT A 100% SURE BUT WE'VE ACQUIRED A NAVIGATION CENTER WITH ZERO HOUSING IN IT. AND WE CAN'T NAVIGATE THEM ANYWHERE TO GO OUT AND THIS IS THE KIND OF MADNESS IT'S GONNA LOSE THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE AND IN CONTINUED SUPPORT ISSUE ALLOCATIONS. BELOW NEW ALLOCATIONS AND IT UNDERMINES OUR OVERALL CONCEPT WHICH IS THAT WE CAN IN THIS AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM QUITE TO NINETY TWO THAT WE DO SO -- I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE HAVE A CARE IN STATE CONVERSATION WITH CITIES WHICH HAD CARE INSTEAD OF RELATIVE TO HOUSING PRODUCTION WE SHOULD HAVE THAT WITH REGARD TO METRICS -- ON HOMELESS -- TRANSITION OFF THE STREETS -- IN NEAR AS I CAN SEE NAVIGATIONS THERE'S A FINE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND SHELTERS ARE FINE BUT THE MISSING PART WOULD GETS GUMMED UP IS THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO PUT THEM BACK WITH THEM OUT FROM THERE. AND IF THE STATE'S NOT HELP IN THERE AND I'M NOT SURE HOW HELP IN -- SO I WOULD JUST MAKE THAT THAT FAIRLY COMMITTEE WHICH IS THAT WE CAN BUSINESS -- AND WE STATE ECOSYSTEM OF HOUSING OPTIONS PRINT OUR EGGS INTO INTO BASKETS RATHER THAN ALLMAN DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. MR THIS YEAH IN YOU KNOW. I'M NOT SURE I CAN ADD MUCH YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THAT'S BEEN SAID HERE ABOUT CREATED METRICS AND AND PROVIDED AND IT -- AND AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH MOVING FORWARD I COME FROM A COUNTY SAN BENITO COUNTY. WHERE WE UTILIZE THESE FINDINGS VERY PROACTIVELY WHERE WE CREATED A HOMELESS RESOURCE CENTER IT'S CALLED HOME THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES MEALS EMPOWERMENT RESOURCE CENTER WHICH HAS A SHELTER? HOUSES FIFTY MEN FIFTY WOMEN -- WE OFFER ONSITE WRAPAROUND SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EMPLOYMENT BASED SERVICES AND YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN AWARDED THESE GRANTS WE WANNA SEE YOU KNOW THIS. YOU KNOW OUR OUR OUR VISION EXPANDED TO NO TO FILL THAT GAP AND THE OUR COMMUNITY -- BUT I SEE THIS WHAT WE DID IN CENTER COUNTY WE PRIORITIZE IS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE MY SECOND YEAR AS A SUPERVISOR THERE IN SAN BENITO. AND IT'S BECOME A REGIONAL MODEL IS BECOME A REGIONAL MODEL FOR THE COUNTY MONTEREY -- AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I APPRECIATE WHAT'S IN THIS REPORT THAT YOU KNOW THIS HOMELESSNESS ATTACKING THIS PROBLEM IS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH WHAT MAY WORK AND THEN IN IN YOU KNOW SOME PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WORKING OTHERS. BUT I APPRECIATE THIS FUNNY BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN THE EVIDENCE BASED EXAMPLES ON HOW THIS CAN WORK ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE YOU KNOW IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT SO. HIGH SUPPORT THIS FINDING AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE IT WORK FOR YOU KNOW -- OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THANK YOU MISTER TING. THANK YOU MISTER -- JUST TO SORT OF SET THE TABLE ON THE ON THE KEEP FINDING ONE OF THE REASONS AND REALLY APPRECIATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR WORK AND SO COLLABORATIVELY AND SO QUICKLY. THE THE WAY THE FUNDING MECHANISM WAS CHOSEN WAS TO REALLY WORK WITH THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND ALL THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND AGAIN THESE ARE THE THESE ARE THE ORGANIZATIONS THESE ARE THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONTLINES OF HOMELESSNESS NOT LAST YEAR NOT LAST MONTH BUT REALLY FOR DECADES. AND SO HE WAS REALLY TO WORK WITH THEM TRY TO GET THEM RESOURCES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAD AN EMERGENCY AND TRY TO GET THOSE RESOURCES. DEPLOYED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. MY INITIAL CONCERN WITH THE PROPOSAL WE WILL FIRST WAITING FOR THE PROPOSAL WILL WILL WE GET THE PROPOSAL -- THE BE GOOD TO GET THE DETAILS BUT THE INITIAL CONCERT WITH PROPOSAL IS. WE DON'T WANT TO GET STOCK IN THE STATE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS WHERE. WE TAKE A YEAR TO DESIGN AN RF P. WE TAKE ANOTHER YEAR TO HAVE GRANT GUIDELINES AND THEN THREE YEARS LATER PEOPLE APPLY IN THE MAYBE FIVE YEARS LATER AFTER WERE ALL GONE THE MONEY GOES OUT THE DOOR. SO I THINK WE WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION -- AGAIN AND I THINK MY CAR THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESOURCES THAT. SHOULD BE SHOULD BE QUALIFIED I THINK WE ALL KNOW BUT THE PROBLEM IS IS TRYING TO GET THE RESOURCES ON THE GROUND THEY DON'T DO US ANY GOOD SITTING HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHEN EACH CD OR IN FINANCE OR IN THE BANK THEY REALLY NEED TO BE IN OUR COUNTIES. IN OUR CITIES AND REALLY TO POINT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO WORK WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GRASSROOTS AND GOVERNMENT GROUPS ARE ON THE GROUND REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN BENITO SAID. WHILE -- I KNOW ONE OF OUR MAJOR POWERS A SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN AROUND NAVIGATION CENTERS AND SHELTERS IN GETTING THOSE UP OTHER OTHER PEOPLE HAVE. DIFFERENT NEEDS ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES. ROAD REALLY NEED DIFFERENT SOLUTION SO AGAIN. ACTUALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE SOLUTIONS ARE AND WHERE THEY NEED TO GO AND THAT'S PARTLY WHY. WE WE GAVE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS SOME LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY SO WASN'T COMPLETELY SO PRESCRIPTIVE FROM SACRAMENTO BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME. TO DO A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY ANALYSIS WILLING TO STAND WHAT'S THE BEST SOLUTION EVERY SO COUNTY. THE PEACE BECAUSE BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FULLERTON AND REALLY WHAT SHE SAID WHICH IS. WHILE THE MONEY GOT TO THE DIFFERENT LOCALES PART OF REALLY WHAT IS STOPPING THE PLACEMENT OF SERVICES OR SHELTERS OR NAVIGATION CENTERS OR PURPOSE PARTY HOUSING IS ALL THE NAME BSM. SO WHAT ONE THING I REALLY -- ENCOURAGE US ALL TO GIVING. GIVING -- LOCALS RESOURCES WHO ARE REALLY WILLING TO STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS MOVE THIS PROCESS. VERY VERY QUICKLY -- I DID LEGISLATION FOR FROM MY CITY AND A COUPLE OTHER CITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE INCLUDING LA AND OAKLAND AND BERKELEY. TO KIND OF STREAMLINED THE PROCESS FOR HOMELESS SHELTERS BUT REALLY -- IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT MORE RESOURCES WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. ATTACHING THAT STREAMLINING TO TO THIS MONEY SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THE SHELTERS OR THE HOUSING WILL GET BETTER BUILT ASAP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LIKE I SAID IT DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD FOR TO BE BUILT FIVE YEARS NOW. WE REALLY NEED THIS TO HAPPEN NOW. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE'LL AND TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. WE'VE GOT THIS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] YOU COULD. AFTERNOON SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THIS PROPOSAL RECORD REPRESENTS WE ARE DISAPPOINTED IN THE SHORT TERM THINKING IT REPRESENTS -- WE DO NEED LONG TERM THINKING TO ADDRESS THIS -- PROBLEM AND USING -- EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS AS A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE SUGGESTED. WE CAN GET PEOPLE HOUSE QUICKLY THROUGH IT'S IN THE PRIVATE MARKET. AND THROUGH OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING THAT ALREADY EXISTS OR THAT IS COMING ONLINE -- WE ALSO NEED COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC PHONY OF SPECIFICALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND WHILE WE NEED INTERMINABLE ENGINES LIKE SHELTERS TO GET PEOPLE ACCESS TO SERVICES TO CONNECT THEM TO PERMANENT HOUSING -- WE DO NOT NEED TO SHUT TO SEE SHELTERS AS A SOLUTION -- IN FACT. ONE OF THE REASONS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS WHY WE HAVE SO MANY AND SHELTER PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE WE HAVE NO FLOW OUT OF THE SHELTERS AND INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA SUGGESTED. OF FINALLY EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT WE SHOULD NEVER SEE SHELTER AS A SOLUTION IT IS NOT A SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS -- EVIDENCE SHOWS THE HOUSING IS A SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK A NUMBER OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MADE THAT POINT REALLY -- REALLY WELL -- WE'VE HAD TOO MANY YEARS OF SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS AND WE NOW NEED LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AND I WOULD JUST COMMEND -- A FOR A. B. -- EIGHT SIXTEEN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY AS FOR US -- ASSEMBLY BILL THREE ZERO SEVEN BOTH OF THOSE PROPOSALS INCLUDE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT REALLY DO -- FUNDS LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AND STRATEGIES TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS PERMANENTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHRIS MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA -- AGAIN WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE INVESTMENT PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IN THE BUDGET BUT HAVE CONCERNS -- AS HAS BEEN MENTIONEDABOUT THE STRATEGIES TO BE FUNDED AND AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AS TO SHELTERS NOT BEING THE SOLUTION TO TO HOMELESSNESS. AS THE GOVERNOR STATED IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS SHELTERS SOLVE SLEEP HOUSING AND SERVICES SOLVE HOMELESSNESS -- BUT WE CAN AND WE CAN MEET THE IMMEDIATE NEED OF PEOPLE LIVING ON OUR STREETS. THROUGH RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND OPERATING SUBSIDIES -- PROPOSED THROUGH AB EIGHT ONE SIX WHICH EMBRACE BRACES BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS OF REGIONAL COLLABORATION -- AND TRULY A HOUSING FOR STRATEGY -- MENTIONS THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO INVEST IN SHORT TERM ASSISTANCE WHILE WE WAIT FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDS TO RAMP UP. AND AS I SAID EARLIER RENTAL ASSISTANCE COULD BE THAT SHORT TERM SOLUTION -- IT BUT NO PLACE LIKE HOME COVERS ONE SPECIFIC POPULATION -- OF ARE HOMELESS. LUCIEN AND NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND OTHER PEOPLE ARE MISSING THE BALL. AND SO WE NEED TO REALLY BE THINKING ABOUT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR IN OUR STATE. AND ALSO WE NEED A ROBUST INVESTMENT -- IN YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AS STATED EARLIER AND FULLY ENDORSE THE STRATEGIES AND AB THREE OR SEVEN TH. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN LAWYERS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YEARS AND I JUST WAS A REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION FROM ALL THE MEMBERS TODAY. AND LOOK FOR TO WEIGHING IN ON THE DETAILS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WE REALLY DO NEED LONG TERM SOLUTIONS ESPECIALLY FOR YEARS THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE FUTURE AND IF. WE DON'T SERVE THEM OTHER YOUTH THEY WILL BECOME OUR CHRONIC FUTURE POPULATION WE KNOW THAT IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE 50% OF THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION FIRST EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY WERE UNDER. TWENTY FIVE THE IF STATES INVESTMENT AND ON GOING FUNDS AND PROGRAMS FOR YOU IS UNDER TWO MILLION DOLLARS. SO SADLY IT'S NOT SURPRISING TO ME TODAY THAT WE HAVE THE PROBLEM THAT WE DO AROUND CHRONICALLY IT. KIND OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL AND THEN IT REALLY ENCOURAGES LEGISLATURE'S STEP UP AND REALLY -- AUGMENTS SOME FUNDING FOR ON GOING PRO LIKELY HOMELESS POPULATION AND WE REALLY NEED TO MARRY THE OPTIONS ARE RAY AND REYES OF HOUSING AND SERVICES TO SUPPORT THEM. AND TRANSITION THEM AND WE KNOW THERE'S ALL THIS RESEARCH AROUND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AS THEY'RE GROWING UP UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AND TEN ALSO NOT FORGET THE NEEDS OF YOUTH THAT ARE ALSO PARENTING AND PREGNANT THING. AS THEIR YOUTH THEMSELVES SO IT REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN WEIGH IN ON THE CONVERSATION ON ONCE MORE DETAILS COMMAND AND WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT YOU CENTERED CORNING ENTRY SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY -- BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE THOSE TOOLS AND TO IDENTIFY YOU THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BE REALLY ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THE CHRONIC POPULATION AND CORE NEED ENTRY. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SEVENTEEN YEARS ON THE STREET BEFORE THEY CAN COME THE TOP OF THE LIST AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO FOR YOU -- AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE AND ADDRESS THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS QUICK LEARNER SO THAT WE CAN PREVENT THIS MOMENT THANK YOU. HI TAMMY MARTIN FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA THE NATION'S LARGEST STATEWIDE LGBT Q. CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AND PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO COMBAT USE HOMELESSNESS. A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER APPROXIMATELY 40% OF HOMELESS YOUTH IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. SO I'D LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF MY CO SPONSOR CAM LEWIS AND URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CAN REALLY ROSENBERGER WAS SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION WERE SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS BUT WE WOULD URGE THAT YOU ARE NOT CREATE A NEW PROGRAM THAT USE EXISTING RESOURCES. WE BELIEVE A LONG TERM SOLUTION MUST INCLUDE PUBLIC SAFETY NET RESOURCES IN COUNTY SERVICES AT THE SIGHT OF LOW INCOME HOUSING AS WELL AS IN THE STREETS WITH OUR WORKERS OUT STATIONED -- OUR MEMBERS HAVE THE TOOLS AND FORTY FOR IMMEDIATE SERVICE DELIVERY EXPANDING ACCESS TO THESE WARS RESOURCE OF APPLE LOCATION WOULD INCREASE PARTICIPATION ENSURE THE NEW YES ARE SEEING THE BENEFITS YOU DESERVE. BY PLACING ARE COUNTY WORKERS ON LOCATION AS NAVIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER COUNTY SERVICES. REMOVE BARRIERS TO ACCESS -- UTILIZE EXISTING RESOURCES AND WORK WITH IN THE COUNTY SERVICE SYSTEM SO THAT THEY CAN GET -- ACCESS TO FOOD JUST HOUSING WEEPING SHELTERS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S JUST STEP ONE IN ADDRESSING THE HOMELESSNESS THINKS. OU. NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE SAN BERNADINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE COUNTY HAS SPENT MANY YEARS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND HAS IMPROVED IT DRASTICALLY WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S AND THE GOVERNOR'S ATTENTION AND INVESTMENTS -- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF INCLUDING MILESTONES AS PART OF THE FUNDING. AS WELL AS FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCALS AND WE BELIEVE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING SHOULD GO THROUGH ALREADY -- IMPLEMENTED PROCESSES SUCH AS HE OR THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS AND HOUSING. THANK YOU. LOUIS BROWN TO AND WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA BE -- ONE ECHO SIMILAR SUPPORT FOR THE LEVEL FUNDING -- MAY ENCOURAGE YOU -- IN IN THE FUTURE TO INCREASE THAT THAT LEVEL FUNDING AND MAKE IT ON GOING -- BUT BUT AND AND WANTED TO ECHO SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION HERE -- HOWEVER DID WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF SHELTER TO CALIFORNIANS -- CALIFORNIA MAY DEPENDS ON HOW YOU COUNT HAVE A MORE ON CHILDREN HOMELESS PEOPLE THAN ALL OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY COMBINED. THE RATE OF ON CHILDREN HOMELESSNESS IN IN THE STATE IS ACTUALLY A VERY UNIQUE PHENOMENON -- IN IN IN OTHER PLACES WHERE -- MOST HOMELESS FOLKS ARE SHELTERED AT THE RATES OF DOMESTIC ABUSE AMONG HOMELESS PEOPLE THE RATES MON -- OF THINGS LIKE DRUG USE AND AND THERE IS THAT I THINK THE ASSEMBLY FINDS TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE OUTCOMES OF OF CALIFORNIANS LIES. ARE MUCH LOWER -- THAT THAT THAT LIFE IN IN A IN IN A SHELTER IS MUCH BETTER THAN A AND IT IT NOT IN. ONE ADEPTLY ONE ECHO THE FACT THAT -- HOUSING. IS THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS IS THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION HOMELESSNESS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE THE STRONG BENEFIT THAT SHELTER DOES. NOT CONVEY AND THE VERY LOW RATE OF SHELTER IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU. REBECCA MARCUS ON BEHALF OF LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO URGE THAT ANY PLANNING -- FOR SPENDING ON HOMELESSNESS MUST ALSO INCLUDE A PRIORITY FOR HELPING HOMELESS SENIORS THE LARGEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC OVER HOMELESS POPULATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MUCH OF THE NEW FUNDING FOR HOME HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CANNOT BE BUILT ARE USED FOR A SENIOR HOUSING SENIORS HAVE MORE COMPLEX HEALTH NEEDS INCLUDING A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING TWO OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WHICH IS NOT CONSIDERED A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS UNDER MANY OF THE HOUSING PROGRAMS THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO WHEN APPLIED THE GOVERNOR FOR THE CONTINUING RECOGNITION THAT STATE FUNDING IS NECESSARY TO HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. WANNA TALK ABOUT A FEW OF THE THINGS FROM LAST YEAR'S ALLOCATIONS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CONTINUED -- FIRST OFF WHEN THE THANK YOU FOR THE SPEED WITH WHICH RESOURCES WERE ALLOCATED. THE FLEXIBILITY -- WE TELL A LINE BETWEEN THE FLEXIBILITY TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS AND ALSO ADDRESS BEST PRACTICES AND AN EVIDENCE BASED YOU KNOW TECHNIQUES THAT WE KNOW OUR SUCCESSFUL BUT WE THINK THAT HE PROGRAM DID A GOOD JOB OF THAT. AND FINALLY WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION AND SO THE ALLOCATIONS TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE WHERE YOU HAVE THE CITIES WHO ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CITING THE COUNTIES WHO ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICES. AND IN THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OFTEN THE PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO EMULATE -- FINALLY WE THINK THE FORMULA ALLOCATIONS THAT ACCOMPANIED THOSE THIS CONTINUUM OF CARE ALLOCATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR WE SHOULD EMULATE THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. IT AT THE NAME IS THE CHAIR MEMBERS MARK THE GUERRERO REPRESENTED THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS JUST WANT -- TO PROVIDE YOU A COUPLE OF UPDATES AND FEEDBACK ON WHAT WE EXPERIENCE WITH THE STATE'S HE DOLLARS -- SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS BUILT A POWERFUL COUNTY WIDE MOVEMENT TO PREVENT IN COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. AND WITH THE STATES HE FUNDING ALLOCATED. IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTING OUR MEASURE H. -- FUNDING IN MANY IMPORTANT WAYS PARTICULARLY FOR PAYING FOR BOTH CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS FOR IN TURN HOUSING. AS WE LOOK AT LOOK AS WE LOOK AT MOVING FRWARD TO RENEWING -- FUNDING -- NEEDS WE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK ON MAXIMIZING ONE TIME FUNDED INDEED OF WHICH THE FUNDING CAN BE SPENT BASED ON THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND THE TIMELINE FOR EXPENDITURE OF THE CURRENT HEAT FUNDS. AUTHORIZED NEW STATE FUNDING TO BE UTILIZED FOR RAPID RE HOUSING AS WELL AS IN TERM HOUSING AND EDUCATION CENTERS. RAPID RE HOUSING IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN SHELTER AND PROVIDES PERMITTED HOUSING TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS. HAVE ANY ABILITY TO BALANCE INCREASES IN IN TERM HOUSING AND RAPID RE HOUSING IS CRITICAL. OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE MANY PEOPLE STUCK IN IN TERM HOUSING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AND IN AND ENSURE THAT ANY NEW STATE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED GEOGRAPHICALLY BASED ON NEED AND WE AS REFLECTED IN THE ANNUAL HOME DISCOUNT. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON PLAN FOR HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU. NEXT REMOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR EXPANDED STATE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO EXPAND THE STATE'S LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IN NINETEEN TWENTY UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY ON THEIR AFTER. UPON APPROPRIATION AS MENTIONED THE AGENDA AT THE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR EXISTING STATE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. TARGETED AT NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT PAIR WITH THE UNDER UTILIZED 4% FEDERAL TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. THE REMAINING TWO HUNDRED MILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED THREE NEW PROGRAM THE TARGETS MIXED INCOME HOUSING WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL WORK ON THE DETAILS OF THAT PROGRAM BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN. L. L.. ONE SECOND OF THIS MODEL IS WITH THE LA -- BUT WE'LL JUST RAISES SOME QUESTIONS FOR US ABOUT WHAT POPULATIONS TO PRIORITIZE WITH THIS FUNDING WELL THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME NEED AMONG THE MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. BECAUSE THE NEED FOR ASSISTANCE AMONG LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OUTSTRIPS AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO IF YOU'RE OPTIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE WOULD SUCH AS THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE STATE RESOURCES TOWARDS THAT POPULATION RATHER THAN -- BROADENING OUT THE INCOME LEVELS -- AND THEN IN ADDITION WITH EXAMPLES OF THE REASONS WHY SHIN. SO -- WHILE ON THE ONE HAND THE FUNDED POTENTIALLY COULD BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY WHICH WOULD REFLECT THE THE CRISIS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE OTHER HAND A NUMBER OF OTHER RESOURCES HAVE BEEN PLACED TOWARDS BILL BUT TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS IN THE RECENT YEARS. AND SO ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO DELAY THE FUNDING -- RELEASE AND THE COULD SENSUALLY SERVE AS A BACKSTOP TO USE LATER FOR EXAMPLE -- IN A SITUATION WHERE THE ECONOMY WERE WEAKER -- THERE'S ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT LONG TERM FUNDING FOR THE MAINTENANCE COSTS OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WOULD BE BUILT UNDER THIS -- IF THERE'S NO DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE COSTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD SEE IT'S A GAINES ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING GLOSSED OVER TIME -- AND THEN FINALLY AS NOTED YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THE DETAILS THAT ARE YET TO BE DEVELOPED AND SO. A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS YOU'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION STAND HERE AS WELL. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] RICHARD. I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PROPOSING -- THE HALF BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS TAX CREDIT IN A TEXT WITH A POLICY IS SO. OFTEN PUT PEOPLE TO SLEEP BUT THIS IS FOR ME PROBABLY THE MOST A PROPOSED -- I'VE ONLY INTRODUCED ONE BILL FIVE TIMES IN A ROW HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT IS TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE TAX CREDIT SO THANK YOU -- AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THE LAST TIME WE PUT THIS ON THE LAST GOVERNOR'S DESK BEFORE HIS VETO WE HAD BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT SO YOU'RE GONNA GET A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THAT EXPANSION. I'VE TWO COMMENTS FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT AND WE HAD REINTRODUCE FOR THE FIFTH TIME IN EXPANSION FOR A HOUSING TAX CREDIT IN AB TEN WITH THE SUPPORT OF MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES -- IN DECEMBER BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ANY BE TEN THEIR WITH THEIR TWO THINGS I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT -- ONE AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A CAP ON INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS AT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IF YOU WERE TO REMOVE THAT CAP IT ACTUALLY WOULD EXPAND THE MARKET FOR THE TAX CREDIT. AND COULD RAISE THE VALUE OF THAT CREDIT OVER A DOLLAR SO -- WOULD LOVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE MINISTRATION ON DOING THAT I THINK IT'S A VERY EASY WAY. TO MAKE THAT TAX CREDIT GO FARTHER ON THE SECOND ONE AS HE WANTED PIGGY BACK ON WHAT THE LA -- WAS ASKED WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IS TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE EXISTING PROGRAM TO A MILLION DOLLARS TO GET AT 6280% OF AM I AND AS AS YOU KNOW THERE IS CURRENTLY -- AS THE UNITS ARE SERVING HOUSE IT INCOME AVERAGING WOULD ALLOW. HOUSEHOLDS AND EARN UP 280% A MY TO BE PART OF THIS AS LONG AS THE AVERAGE IS NO MORE THAN 60%. I HAVE TO ASK WHY YOU FEEL NECESSITY TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW PROGRAM WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE INCOME AVERAGING EMBEDDED IN THIS I THINK THAT SORRY TRYING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT -- GETTING INTO SOME OF THE THE THE HIGHER INCOME CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN AROUND THE FOR BY HOUSING PROGRAMS. SURE SO WE UNDERSTAND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGE THE ROLE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH RESPECT TO THE INCOME AVERAGING CHING THEM SORRY. WHICH WILL HELP FACILITATE THE FOCUS WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH 68% I AM I AM I HOWEVER WE'RE BUILDING AND WE WANT TO BUILD AND FLEXIBILITY TO EXPLAIN THIS BAND THIS PROGRAM. TO INDIVIDUALS WITH A HIGHER A MY OKAY I I HAVE TO MIDNIGHT I THINK -- INCOME AVERAGING IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW THINGS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DID THAT MADE A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE -- BUT I THINK SAYING THAT AN ENTIRE POT OF MONEY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO GO TO THIS CATEGORY WHEN THERE ARE. ONE AND A HALF MILLION OF FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA -- THEY'RE TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO THE 60% AND MY BELOW I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE SO I I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN MORE OF A CONVERSATION I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET AT THAT. AIM ON A BAND THAT WOULD BE MORE -- EFFICIENT AS FAR AS THE USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS SO HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THAT BUT I WANT TO JUST PROVIDE THAT FEEDBACK. MISTER GLORIA THANK HIM OF ITS CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF A CHALLENGE TO ON ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE YOU'RE ONE OF THE MORE AT PROBABLY AFTER THE GENERAL DISTRESS ABOUT OUR HOMES TO SITUATION THE MOST COMMON HOME HOUSING QUITE A COMPLAINT I RECEIVE. IS FROM FOLKS WHO MAKE TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM -- BUT WHO DON'T -- WHO CANNOT AFFORD THEM PRODUCING ON IT SO THIS FOCUS ON -- BUYER INCOME MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING I THINK IS IMPORTANT. PROJECT CO AUTHOR -- THIS CHOOSE LEGISLATION SPEAKS SOME OF THIS -- I WOULD JUST ONE OBSERVATION IS AS WE CREATE THESE DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TIME IS MONEY. THAT WE SEND A LOT OF DEVELOPERS -- ALL OVER SACRAMENTO ASKING DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE STATE WHETHER IT'S THE TREASURER'S OFFICE EIGHT CD. OF THE STREET BOTH COUNTS ON OTHERS -- YOU KNOW THAT'S TIME THAT'S EXPENSE THAT'S ALL AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUT MONEY IN GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR -- AND AND REDUCE COSTS IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE A LONG TERM VISION FOR ADMINISTRATION AS THE ABILITY BE A FOR QUITE SOME TIME. TO LOOK AT CONSOLIDATING STREAMLINING AND MAYBE CENTRALIZING -- THOSE -- THAT APPROVAL PROCESS IN ORDER TO GET MORE PRODUCTION GET MORE UNITS HELP OUR FAMILIES -- IN THE LAST SIX ABOUT TO LEAVE IT FOR REDUCING THE FOR THE BALL -- NOTED ANY FOR THE QUOTE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MITCHELL FELL. SPEAKING FOR THE FEW AND THE PROUD THIS IS AN EXCELLENT% BIPARTISAN BILL AND I BELIEVE IT WILL HAVE EXCELLENT SUPPORT AND HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNOR WILL AGREE. THANK YOU. KILL GOING UP UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. YEAH. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON DOESN'T MATTER NOT WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA -- I'M HERE TODAY AT TWO TO EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE INCREASED. TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION AND REALLY REQUEST THAT A PORTION OF THESE NEW FUNDS BE ALLOCATED SPECIFICALLY FOR HOME OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. MANY HOMEOWNERSHIP -- OWNER OCCUPIED DEVELOPMENTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE -- FOR THE LOW INCOME TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AND WE ARE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON ON AB. EIGHT THIRTY TWO TWO I REALLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WOULD REALLY HOPE. FOR SUPPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE AND FROM THE GOVERNOR ON GOOD AFTERNOON MARINO MIGHT WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM -- PROUD TO CO SPONSOR FOR THAT FIFTY TIMES. OF THE BILL MENTION BY FAMILY MEMBERS TO AN ACT OF THE COMMENTS THAT HE MADE EARLIER -- JUST WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS THE ANY -- FROM A DEVELOPER'S PERSPECTIVE THE CHALLENGE THAT WOULD BE PLACE AND HAVING THE BIFURCATION OF THE TWO PROGRAMS WITH A SPECIFIC BAN AT SIXTY TO EIGHTY WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO PAIR. THE STATE TAX CREDIT WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT THERE BY MAKING THE COST SORT OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU HAVE TO PUT INTO EACH -- UNIT FROM THE STATE POOL MUCH HIGHER -- AND SO FOR LIKE EFFICIENCY PURPOSES IT WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE TO HAVE IT BE IN ONE THE ONE PART OF MONEY IN EXISTING PROGRAM -- AND THE SECOND IS THAT FOR THE ONE TIME MONEY THIS TO BE A GREAT WAY TO FIND SORT OF THE 9% PROGRAM PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED HOWEVER WITHOUT AN ON GOING EXPECTATION. OF TAX CREDITS COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE DOWN THE ROAD -- DEVELOPERS CAN ACTUALLY PLAN FOR FUTURE PROJECTS TO UTILIZE THE CREDIT MAKING IT REALLY HARD TO THAN BILL THIS PIPELINE OF PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO GO WHEN THE CREDIT BECOME AVAILABLE -- SO WE REALLY URGE THE ADMINISTRATION REDDIT INCREASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I LOSE MY TAPE FROM CALIFORNIA BE -- ECHOING THAT DESIRE FOR A LONG TERM I THINK BETWEEN AB TEN AND THIS PROPOSAL ARE PREFERENCES FOR AB -- TEN IN IN IN IN LARGE PART FOR THAT WERE WERE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SHORT. AND ARE FOR A HOUSING AT NEEDS AND SO THAT THAT PROBLEMS NOT GOING ANYWHERE. ANYTIME SOON SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IF YOU JUST WANT TO ECHO AT AND I'VE I DID FORGET TO MENTION THE POINT THAT WAS JUST MADE A PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT HOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AB TEN AND WHAT -- THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED OBVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATION AS PROPOSED ONE TIME DOLLARS. LESS AGAIN FOR THE PIPELINE THE LONG TERM PIE PLATE OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF WE DON'T HAVE PREDICTABILITY INTO THE FUTURE WHAT AB TEN PROPOSED IS THAT WE SPEND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INTO THE FUTURE SO THAT -- DEVELOPERS CAN KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON US ARE WORKING ON PIPELINE PROJECTS A POSSIBILITY OF PERRIN ST DOLLARS WITH LOCAL DOLLARS AND FEDERAL FOR A 9% TAX CREDITS -- OBVIOUSLY THE AMOUNT IS ONE THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS GIVEN THE BUDGET REALITIES THAT WE HAVE -- BUT I THINK THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT WHAT COULD WE COMMIT TO THIS YEAR THAT WILL HELP US -- GIVE HOUSING THE HOUSING COMMUNITY SOME CERTAINTY IN THE FUTURE I THINK IS A CONVERSATION THAT IS IMPORTANT HAVE -- IN THIS FISCAL YEAR [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY REMOVAL UNDERWATER NUMBER FIVE MODERATE INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION. JERRY AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO INVEST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME IN DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS -- THIS WILL EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCIES EXISTING MIXED INCOME HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM. AND SO THIS IS AN EXISTING PROGRAM JUST ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND WE BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN AT THIS TIME. L. L.. A SIMILAR TO MY COMMENT ON THE PRIOR ITEM THAT ALSO RAISES QUESTIONS FOR US ABOUT WHICH POPULATIONS TO PRIORITIZE IF YOU ALLOCATE. OF FUNDING TO ADDRESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEN IF THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE FORWARD YOU ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE SAME SORT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT. TIMELINE FOR EXAMPLE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. RESEARCH YOU. THINK THE ONE COMMENT I WOULD ADD IN AND UNFORTUNATELY STIR GLORIA HAD TO LEAVE AND HE CHAIRS ARE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HOW WE ADDRESS THE SO CALLED MISSING MIDDLE. WE ALL KNOW THAT BUILDING MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING IS CRITICAL IT'S NOT BEING BUILT TODAY AND WHAT WE'RE REFERRING TO IS A HOUSING THAT -- IT NEEDS TO BE BILL TO ADDRESS A HUGE POPULATION OF THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH MONEY TO QUALIFY FOR FOR WILL HOUSING -- BUT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH INCOME TO PURCHASE CURRENTLY PRODUCED MARKET RATE -- I THINK I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SORT OF OBSERVE BUILDING THESE UNITS ARE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THERE AREN'T OTHER SUBSIDIES ARE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES WE CAN USE ON THIS -- AND HI I I LIKE THE IDEA OF US INVESTING MONEY IN THIS CURRENT FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM I KNOW IS FORTY THREE MILLION. YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT GOES UP TO HALF A BILLION DOLLARS I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO THINK AGAIN OF WHAT'S THE BEST USED FOR THE SUBSIDY -- AND I DO I DO THINK THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT COULD LEVERAGE PRIVATE SECTOR RESOURCES -- IN A MORE SIGNIFICANT WAY EXEMPTING PROPERTY TAXES FOR MISSING THEIR PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE SO AGAIN -- THIS IS -- I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A PLACE HOLDER OF MONEY FOR THIS BUT EXACTLY HOW YOU DO IT WHAT THAT LEVEL IS COMPARED TO OTHER NEEDS AS ONE AND I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT. TERMS WILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I'D I THINK GO WE NEED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GOAL IS HERE AND IF IF THE GOAL IS TO DO SOMETHING SUBSTANTIVE ARE WE REALLY MOVING THE DIAL. BY -- JUST TAKE A YOU KNOW ONE TIME LUMP SUM OF A HALF BILLION DOLLARS -- WHICH AT THE COST OF PRODUCTION OF MOST HOUSING TODAY ACROSS THE STATE. BEING SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT -- PRODUCES A THOUSAND UNITS TIME NOT SAYING THAT THOSE THOUSAND UNITS ARE NOT IMPORTANT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE AND BUT THE NEED. THAT NUMBER OF UNITS -- I JUST THINK WE NEED TO THINK MORE COMPREHENSIVELY ABOUT THIS -- THIS POINT THAT I'M MAKING APPLIES TO MANY OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY. IF WE DON'T FIND WAYS TO CREATE HOUSING THAT GO ABOVE AND BEYOND -- OF THIS KIND OF SUBSIDY -- OR FIND WAYS TO LOWER THE PER UNIT CONSTRUCTION COST. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE CATCH UP WITH THE NEED. I OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT. SAYS THE MAN NOT LIKE HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA -- JUST WANTED. TO SAY THAT WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE -- OF EXPANDING THIS TO HIGHER INCOME LEVELS AS DEPENDING ON WHERE OUR HABITAT AFFILIATES ARE LOCATED WE DO SERVE -- INDIVIDUALS OUT TO HIGHER LEVELS OF THE EMI AND SO WE'RE WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS -- PROPOSAL THANK YOU. LOUIS FRONT THEIR BEHALF OF CALIFORNIAN BE -- MANY OF THE ACTIVISTS AROUND THE STATE ARE ON THINGS LIKE SSI ABOUT MOST MEMBERS OF OUR MOVEMENT ARE ARE REASONABLY MIDDLE CLASS -- WE PRETTY STRONGLY FEEL THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD RESOURCES ON THOSE WITH THE DEEPEST NEED FOR HOUSING -- CAM ALIGNING OUR COMMENTS SIMILAR TO TO THE DOES PREVENTION BY -- THE LA -- OTHER PROPOSALS CAN REALLY HELP THE STATE -- ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING PROPOSALS LIKE ASSEMBLY BILL -- SIXTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER EIGHTY USING CALIFORNIA FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER TANG OR SB FIFTY FROM CENTER WINNER -- THOSE PROPOSALS ARE MUCH MORE STRATEGICALLY TARGETED AT GETTING THIS TYPE OF HOUSING THAT WE NEED -- WHILE OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE OUR SHELTER PROGRAMS AND ARE LIKE THAT PROGRAMS THE PROGRAMS WERE ALL DISCUSSING TODAY -- REMAIN UNDONE UNDERFUNDED THANKS THANK YOU.

DIS CAN REALLY ONLY BE USED AS A ONE LAYER MULTI LAYERED FINANCING PLANS ARE COBBLED TOGETHER TO FUND PROJECTS WE NEED TO GIVE LOCAL AGENCIES ADDITIONAL TOOLS NOT JUST THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE THEIR OWN TAX. INCREMENT WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNITIES NOT MOVING FORWARD AGGRESSIVELY ENOUGH TO FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. YET WE IS A STATE MAINTAIN RIDICULOUS BEARS LIKE TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR INVESTMENTS OF BONTA SPECIAL TAXES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION AS PART OF THIS CA ONE AS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE AS BE PARTNERS IN SOLVING. THANK YOU. FOR VOEPEL. WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF MY CITY WE HAD THESE -- ZONES. AND I FELT VERY COMFORTABLE. WHEN THE PEOPLE? VOTED TO TAX THEMSELVES AT 55% VOTER APPROVAL LEVELS -- I BY LOOK UPON. THIS AS BEING A USEFUL TOOL.
