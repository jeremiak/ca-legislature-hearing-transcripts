SENATOR PAN THANK YOU MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FOURTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL AND ACT REALLY INTO HEALTH FACILITIES. SENATOR PENN THE FLOORS YEARS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS SOME PLEASE PRESENT AT TEN FOURTEEN BY SOME MEMBER DONALD WHICH HAS TO DEAL WITH. OUR LOCAL HOSPITALS WHO OF COURSE ARE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR COMMUTER NOT JUST BUSINESSES THEY ARE DEFINITELY COMMUNITY. RESOURCES AB TEN FORTY REQUIRES HOSPITALS PROVIDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC PRIOR TO A PLANNED REDUCTION. OR ELIMINATION OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. THE DECISION BY HOSPITALS REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SERVICES CAN CREATE SERIOUS CHALLENGES FOR A COMMUNITY. THE FACT IN THE AUTHORS DISTRICT LAST YEAR TO CAN BE HOSPITAL OF LONG BEACH CLOSED ITS DOORS AFTER PROBABLY DIVERTING EMERGENCY ROOM PATIENTS TO OTHER HOSPITALS. THIS WAS DONE WITH VERY LITTLE NOTICE THE RESIDENTS IN VERY LITTLE TIME TO ENGAGE THE HOSPITAL PROVIDER ON ALTERNATIVE TO CLOSURE. AS A RESULT PATIENTS NOW EXPERIENCE LONGER WAITING TIMES FOR SERVICES LONGER AMBULANCE TRAVEL TIMES AND OVERCROWDING AT OTHER HOSPITALS IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE TO LONG BEACH IS PREVALENT UP AND DOWN THE STATE IS MORE HOSPITALS CLOSE ARE CHOOSING SOLIDI I THINK PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. AB TEN FOURTEEN WILL PROVIDE COMMITTEE HERE'S WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY BY GIVEN MORE TIME TO FULLY INVESTIGATE. AND THEN IF I OTHER OPTIONS INCLUDING POTENTIALLY SECURING A NEW-PROVIDER TO PREVENT THE CLOSURE OF A CRITICAL HOSPITAL. AT THE VERY LEAST THIS BILL ALLOWS PATIENTS AND RESIDENTS TO BETTER PREPARE FOR THEIR NEXT EMERGENCY WHEN THEIR LOCAL HOSPITAL IS CLOSED. THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER STONE THANK YOU MATTER PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB TOWN ONE FOR. THIS MIGHT NEED SOME MEDICINE. WELL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR AND THE BILL AB TEMAN FOR THIS LEGISLATURE'S PUT A LOT OF REGULATIONS ON HOSPITALS AND A LOT OF NEW MANDATES ON HOSPITALS ESPECIALLY. IN AREAS WHERE WE SEE SIGNIFICANT HOMELESS POPULATIONS THEY HAVE TO BASICALLY BABY SET THE HOMELESS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THIRTY DAYS OF MEDICINE WHEN THEY LEAVE MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A DESTINATION TO WHERE THEY HAVE TO GO AND MANY OF THESE HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE BLEEDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A MONTH. AND MAKING A AN EXECUTIVE DECISION TO CLOSE AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOWN IF THEY'RE PART OF A CHAIN IN ORDER TO KEEP THE OTHER URGENCY ROOMS OPEN THROUGHOUT THEIR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS ARE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS SO WE NEED TO LET THE HOSPITAL'S MAKE THE BEST DECISION THAT THEY CAN IN ORDER TO KEEP THE DOORS OF THE REMAINING FACILITIES UP CERTAINLY CONSOLIDATION MAY BE A GOOD THING ECONOMICALLY FOR HOSPITALS BUT- WE CAN EXPECT A HOSPITAL TO BLEED. A WEEK AFTER WEEK MONTH AFTER MONTH BECAUSE WE'RE FIGHTING MANDATE THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HOMES POP PLACE. AND THAT THEY REALLY. DID NOT CREATE. AND THE AMOUNT UNCOMPENSATED CARE. THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY BY STATE LAW BY FEDERAL LAW. WE NEED THE HOSPITALS HAVE THE ECONOMY TO DO WITHIN THEIR FINANCIAL BEST INTEREST TO CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY DO AND PROVIDING QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR. ALL OF OUR POPULATION THE COULD IN THE INDIGENT POPULATION HOW WE CANNOT HAMSTRING THEM FOR SOME TO TAKE A LOSS FOR THOSE REASONS I REQUEST A NO VOTE ON A. B. TEN ONE FOUR. SENATOR DODD. A YES QUESTION BEFORE MANAGER PLEASE. SENATOR PAN WOULD YOU ACCEPT YES I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS YEAH ONE OF THE KIDS CONCERNS THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO BE ON THIS BILL I THINK IS WHAT IS RIGHTEOUS BUT I WOULD VALUE YOUR EXPERIENCE IN IN IN THESE AREAS. THAT YOU KNOW IF I IF I HOSPITAL IT DOES HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION TO CLOSE HAVING A SIX THE SIX MONTH NOTICE WOULD PERHAPS BRING A NUMBER OF DOCTORS OR AND OR NURSES YEAH WE HAVE STAFFING RATIOS AND HOSPITALS ALL SAID AND WILL RESIGN BECAUSE LOOK AT THEY'VE GO A FAN FOR THEMSELVES AND GO TO WORK. YO SOUGHT SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I WORRY ABOUT THE AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A BILL LIKE THIS AND WHAT IT DOES TO STAFFING ISSUES. EVER ALREADY TOUGH SITUATION. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION FROM MY GOOD FRIEND FROM NAPA I WOULD SAY FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE CERTAINLY A CLOSURE ANY ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE WHETHER IT'S A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OR- TWO DAYS. WILL BE DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE STAFFING RIGHT I THINK WHAT WE WANT IN THIS CASE WITH THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMUNITY TO HOSPITAL WORK TOGETHER SAY IS THERE. A POSSIBILITY OF AN ALTERNATIVE RIGHT AND I THINK IN ENGAGING. ANSWERED THE STAFF WILL BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL AFTER ALL DISPOSITIONS TO HAVE ADMITTING PRIVILEGES. AT THE HOSPITAL WILL WANT TO BE SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE STILL AVAILABLE AND- IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION FOR PROVIDING THE SERVICES WE NEED TO HAVE YOU SURE THERE'S THE TIME FRAME FOR DOING THAT SO CERTAINLY I RECOGNIZE THE CONCERN THAT YOU RAISE THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN OUR- COMMITTEE AS WELL BUT I ALSO WITH. IS THAT. HAVE A YOU KNOW THAT. GIVEN NOTICE CERTAINLY TWELVE. IS THE SERVING ON PEOPLE GO AWAY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ALSO GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY THEN TO HAVE THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS. TO TRY TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S AN ALTER THE SIMPLY JUST CLOSING THAT EMERGES FROM ESPECIALLY IN A RURAL COMMUNITY MAYBE THE ONLY HOSPITAL FOR A VERY LONG. WAY AWAY AND I THINK THAT THE COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER KNOWING THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. IS GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO SAVE THOSE SERVICES AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. SENATOR DODD. FOLLOW UP QUESTION. SENATE MAN JOHN. OKAY THAT I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER I THINK IT IS ADDRESSED QUESTION. THAT COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS BILL WOULD HAVE IT WOULD A BIT SPECIFIC EXAMPLE WHY THIS BILL WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT AND WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. WELL AS I AM. ENTER PAN IF I COULD WILL GET THROUGH THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS AND THEN YOU CAN USE USE YOUR CONCLUSION TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AT CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THAT YOU KNOW EMERGENCY ROOMS WERE FACED WITH. THESE ISSUES. IN OUR VERY RULE PARTS OF THE OF THE STATE BUT- THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS. THAT EMERGENCY ROOMS WERE FOR MERGES CITIES AND THEY BECOME A PLACE WHERE IT'S PRIMARY. CARE IS GIVEN AND THE ACA WAS SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS THAT AND IT HASN'T QUITE FRANKLY. TO THE CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF THE RULE HOSPITALS IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN KEEP THE DOORS OPEN. AND ONE OF THE WAYS IS BECAUSE IT BECAME THE PRIMARY CARE YOUR EMERGENCY ROOM IT'S DRAINING THE REST OF THE HOSPITAL. AND SO THEY CLOSED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DOWN SO THEY CAN SUSTAIN THE REST OF THE HOSPITAL SO THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH. EMERGENCY ROOMS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS THE PROBLEM IS SOMEWHERE ELSE THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE USING OUR PRIMARY CARE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE ARE USING. THEIR MERGES THE ROOM FOR THE PRIMARY CARE. AND WHEN YOU GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM THEY THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY SAY. WELL WE'VE SEEN YOU FIVE TIMES THIS MONTH FOR THE SAME THING AND A LOT OF PEOPLE USE EMERGENCY ROOM. AS A SOCIAL VISIT QUITE FRANKLY I MY COUSIN WHO. YOU'VE MET ON THE FLOOR HERE SERVED IN EMERGENCY ROOMS I TALKED HIM ALL THE TIME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS. THERE FOR EMERGENCIES NOT FOR YOUR PRIMARY CARE THAT IS THE PROBLEM AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE NEED TO DRESS. THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE A BUSINESS WORK. THAT IS REGULATED DID THAT REGULATE ENVIRONMENT IS BECAUSE THEM SO I HEARD YOU KNOW BUT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY. WORK ON THE PROBLEM. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE USE EMERGES ROOM. AND IS NOT AN EMERGENCY WE NEED TO HAVE THEM. USE THEIR OFFICE VISIT TIME IN THOSE AREAS TO GET THEIR HEALTH. SENATOR GONZALEZ. YES I JUST WANT TO THINK AS SENATOR PLAN FOR FLOOR MANAGING THIS BECAUSE COMING FROM LONG BEACH WHERE WE DID HAVE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL CLOSE NOT TOO LONG AGO THIS EXTENSION ENABLED US TO RE NEGOTIATE A FINANCING PLAN WE ENTERED INTO A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH WAS FORMALLY MOLINA HEALTH CARE OF A BRAND NEW A BELIEVE IT'S M. W. AND WHO IS THE NEW FINANCING PARTNER WITH THE CITY OF LONG BEACH CREATIVE FINANCING ALSO ALLOWED US TO DISCUSS NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR NURSES ESPECIALLY REGISTERED NURSES THAT. DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD BE RELOCATED OR NOT AND THIRDLY IT ENABLED US TO ADD A SO BRING BEDS IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH I THINK WAS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY BUT HAVING THAT EXTRA TIME I THINK WILL ENABLE. US TO HAVE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS UP AND DOWN THE STATE SHOULD ANOTHER HOSPITAL A CLOSE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR. A PATRICK O'DONNELL AS WELL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. SENATOR NIELSEN. BETTER PRESENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THIS IS KIND OF A LONG TERM ISSUE THAT HAS. POPPED UP IN NO SMALL MEASURE BECAUSE OF POLICIES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE REALIGNMENT. WHICH DUMPED THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD AREADY BEEN IN CUSTODY IN CALIFORNIA AND IN TREATMENT. INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. MANY WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT REQUIRE ATTENTION. AND WHERE DO THEY SHOW UP. THE ER. I HAD POLLS OVER THE PAST YEARS FROM YOUR HEAD NURSES SAYING. THE PRISON JUST PULLED UP. WITH THE BUS. AND DUMPED OFF A PAROLE WE- WHO IS DESTABILIZED. AND IS DANGEROUS AND WE HAVE HIM HERE. IN THE ER. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY. THE TRAINING OR THE FACILITIES TO DEAL WITH THESE KINDS OF INDIVIDUALS THEN PRESENTS DANGER. OFTEN SAFETY AND PROTECTION THE PATIENTS THE STAFF THE DOCTORS. EVERYBODY AT THAT FACILITY. WE'VE GOT A HAD THE IRONIC OPPOSITE. IN PARADISE BUT WE LOST A HOSPITAL BUT THE E. R. WAS RETAINED. IT DIDN'T BURKE. THAT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH HERE. AND THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I VOTED FOR BILL AYE FORMALLY NEVER WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED HERE. ALLOWING A E. R. DR TO IMPOSE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD. WHY WOULD I WANT TO VOTE YES ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE TRAINING TO DEAL WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES IN THE CAPABILITY TO DEAL WITH ONE. HOWEVER I HAD TO ACCEPT THAT THERE THERE. BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THEY ARE THERE. AND THEY ARE PROBLEMS. NOW THAT PROBLEM DOES NOT GET SOLVED WITH THIS. I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT WE HAVE A HOSPITAL ORANGE COUNTY THAT. ATTENTION ABOUT EMERGENCY ROOMS YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AMAZING. AMOUNT OF BACK UP SUPPORT FOR HEART ATTACKS FOR STROKES YOU NEED A LOT OF STAFFING WITH THE ATTACHED HOSPITAL. IN IT IT DOES BECOME VERY DIFICULT AND WE HAVE THE CITY A IN THE CITY OF US THANK MANY FELLOW FRUSTRATED THAT TO AN EMERGENCY ROOMS CLOSE THEY REZONE THE SILLY AS EMERGENCY ROOM ALL ME TO THE HOSPITAL HAD A CLOSE EVERYTHING. AND SO THIS BUILDING WONDERFUL FACILITY% JUST SITS WITH A GREEN FENCE AROUND IT BEING. NOT USE SO IT. PROPERTY HOSPITAL'S VERY THIN PROFIT MARGIN IF AT ALL WHEN I WAS SERVED ON THE CAL OPTIMA BOARD FOR FOUR YEARS SAID IT'S A COUNTY OPERATIVE HEALTH SYSTEM WE HAD ONE HOSPITAL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY. DRIVE OVER TO OUR OFFICES EVERY WEEK TO GET THEIR PAYMENTS SO THEY COULD PUT IT IN THE BANK AND START PAYING BILLS SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA BE REAL CAREFUL WITH HOSPITALS IN. AND WHAT WE'RE PUTTING ON THEIR BACKS WHEN THEY'RE READY STRUGGLING SITE. I URGE A NO VOTE. ON A. B. TEN FOURTEEN. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATE BILL. BETTER PRESIDENT THE THIS SATURDAY WE HAD A SITUATION WHERE WE HAD TO HOSPITALS THE TOWN ROAD MEDICAL PATIENTS ONE WAS THE COUNTY HOSPITAL VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER WHICH IS THE LARGEST SO A PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE SECOND ONE WAS O'CONNOR HOSPITAL. AND BY ALLOWING MORE TIME. IN TERMS OF NOTICE OF CLOSURE IT GIVES THE COUNTY OF ESPECIALLY MORE TIME TO ADJUST TO HANDLING THE INCREASED AND MEDI CAL PATIENTS AND I THINK THIS BILL IS A GOOD BILL WE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE SAID INVOLVES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS CARE THE COST TO THE OUT OF THE NEEDS TO BE. TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION THE BILL WILL SAVE MONEY IT WILL SAVE THE STATE MONEY ANALYSTS SAY THE COUNTY HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS MONEY OF OVER THE LARGE NUMBER MEDI CAL PATIENTS IN OUR COUNTY WERE SERVED WELL BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS EVENTUALLY PURCHASING O'CONNOR HOSPITAL FOR USE BY THE COUNTY. AND WE CUT WE CONSUMMATED THAT AGREEMENT THIS YEAR SO I REGION I VOTE ON THOSE THIS WILL HELP PRESERVE THE BASIC SAFETY NET HOSPITALS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN CALIFORNIA PLUS THE BASIC ACUTE CARE EMERGENCY ROOMS. WE NEED TO HAVE ARJUN AYE VOTE. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. THING NINE SENATOR PAN YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE WE HAD ON THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK A GOOD FRIEND FROM LONG BEACH FOR SHARING HER EXPERIENCES A SAID THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL UP PART OF WHAT PROMPTED THIS BILL AS THE EXPERIENCE OF THAT CAN BE HOSPITAL LONG BEACH CLOSING ITS DOORS OUT SOMEONE. THAT I THINK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM HAS A ALSO SHARED HIS EXPERIENCE WITH HOSPITAL CLOSURE IN HIS DISTRICT I'VE I DO WANT TO RESPOND TO. GOOD FRIENDS A REGARDING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. ABOUT THIS BILL FIRST OF ALL. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT. THAT DURING THE FIRES RIGHT THE LOS THE HOSPITAL PARADISE. IN FACT WE AND I WAS PROUD TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION HERE AND THIS SENATE. SPECIAL ALLOW AN EMERGENCY ROOM TO RE OPEN. DESPITE THE FACT THAT. THEY DIDN'T REALLY QUITE HAVE THE FULL HOSPITAL THERE BECAUSE THE HOUSE WAS BURNED DOWN. AND I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE VITAL ROLE THAT MERGES ROOM PLAYS IN THE COMMUNITY THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY. KERRY Là HAD LEGISLATION HERE. TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT WE CAN ALLOW WE NEED TO HELP THE ALLOW HOSTILE TO RE OPEN AND EMERGENCY ROOM A COMMUNITY THAT WITH THIS. BY FIRE EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE COMPONENTS A NECESSARILY NEEDED AND WE FIGURED THAT OUT AND I WANT TO THANK MIKE. A GOOD FRIEND FROM TO HIM FOR CHAMPIONING THAT AND TO WORK WITH HIM ON ON THAT ISSUE BUT I THINK THAT ALSO SPEAKS TO WHY WE NEED THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL. IN TERMS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE STATE'S THAT ACCIDENTAL. THE MEDI CAL EXPANSION IN THE FULL A CA. HE HAD FEWER HOSPITAL CLOSURES. PARTICULARLY RURAL COMMUNITIES THE STATE THAT HAVE IT. WE ARE WE. ARE SEEING RURAL HOSPITALS CLOSE. AND THAT'S IT. AND IN FACT MANY OF THEM ARE THE ONLY PROVIDERS FOR LARGE AREAS AND IN FACT THE ACA HAS ALLOWED MORE THOSE HOSPITAL STAY OPEN. DO WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM YES WE DO. AND I KNOW MY GOOD. FRIEND FROM THE TO MACULA AND I HAVE WORK TO TRY TO IMPROVE PAYMENT RATES RIGHT BECAUSE- THIS I SIMPLY I DON'T THIS BILL SIMPLY. RIGHTS MORE TIME. FOR TO MUSIC COME TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. YES THERE ARE UNDERLYING ISSUES WE'VE WRESTLED WITH SO THOSE RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE SENATE. BUT WE ALSO NEED THAT TIME FOR THEM TO WORK TOGETHER AND AGAIN THAT THE L. SPEAKING TO THE STAFFING ISSUES AND THE OTHER THINGS. WE NEED TO HAVE THAT TIME FOR COMMUNITIES BILL TO COME TOGETHER. YES THERE'S MORE THINGS FOR US TO DO HERE IN THE STATE SENATE HELP SUPPORT HOSPITAL TO KEEP THEM OPEN. AND WE HAVE DONE SOME OF THOSE AND YES WE SHOULD DO MORE. BUT THE SAME TIME WHEN THE HOSPITAL'S ABOUT THE CLOTHES WE ALSO NEED TO GIVE THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITY. AND THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION AND MAYBE EVEN APPEAL TO ONE OF US OF ITS ONE HAPPENED TO BE IN OUR AREA. TO SAY HEY CAN DO SOMETHING OTHER HELP WE CAN DO JUST LIKE WE DID FOR. THE AT THE E. R. AND IN PARADISE THAT WE CAN HELP TRY TO KEEP THAT. WE ARE OPEN. SO WITH THAT AGAIN WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO SPOKE ON THE BILL I TONIGHT VOTES. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. ARCHULETA I ATKINS AYE BATES NOBEL I PURCHASED NO BRADFORD I CAN BE AT ALL I CHIANG.

SENATOR MINING MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN FORTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE AN ACT RELATING TO WELL I GUESS SENATOR MINING THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS AB FOURTEEN FORTY UPDATES LAWSON NATIONALLY ENACTED IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. GOVERNING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES ALSO KNOWN AS DR GIVES PRIMARY CONSIDERATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN MAKING OIL WELL PERMITTING DECISIONS. OTHER STATE NATURAL RESOURCES ENTITIES HAVE A CLEAR MISSION TO PRIORITIZE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AB FOURTEEN FORTY WILL DO THE SAME FOR DR. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS ABOUT 75% OF THE STATE'S OIL IS PRODUCED FOR CALIFORNIANS AND SO I THINK WHEN I GET UP AND SPEAK ABOUT OIL PEOPLE THINK IT'S SELF CENTERED OR SELF SERVING BECAUSE MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY THRIVES ON AN ECONOMY THAT'S OIL DRIVEN BUT DOING SOME DATA RESEARCH HIGH FOUND OUT. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ACTUALLY REDUCED THE PERMITS REQUIRED FOR DRILLING AND CONSERVE OIL PRODUCTION. IS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY DOWN EIGHTY PER OR SEES ME 40% SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. BUT THE CONSUMPTION RATE FOR CALIFORNIANS HAS GONE UP OVER TWENTY TWO PERCENT. AND SO WHEN YOU THINK IF YOU'RE NT DRILLING FOR OIL IN PRODUCING OIL INTO THE GREATEST MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY STRICT. REGULATORY PROCESSES IN WHERE DOES THE OIL COME FROM THAT WE CALIFORNIANS IN ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS CONSUME. IT COMES FROM IRAQ ECUADOR IN SAUDI ARABIA. AND TO IMPORT THAT OIL INTO OUR COAST THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY WHEN THIS THESE VESSELS LAND. A WE EXPORT ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED VESSELS THAT COME TO UNITED STATES VIA SAUDI ARABIA ECUADOR AND IRAQ. AND WHEN I THINK OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES THE ATTACKS ON WHAT PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY SWEAR TO DEFEND THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY WOMEN BARELY GOT THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSES IN SAUDI ARABIA BUT THEY STILL CAN'T EVEN DRIVE WITHOUT A MALE ESCORT. WE DON'T ACTUALLY FUNDS THOSE THINGS BUT WE ACTUALLY SEND THE MONEY IN A QUICK EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER VESSEL AGAIN TWO HUNDRED VESSELS A YEAR. BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DECREASED OUR OIL PRODUCTION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE INCREASED CONSUMPTION AS CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK AS THE DECLINE IN THE KEY IN THE PRODUCTION OF OIL IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND AGAIN PRODUCING OIL OUTSIDE OF THIS STATE WHICH IS PRODUCED WITHOUT. A REFERENCE OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO THE ENVIRONMENT OR PRODUCED OUTSIDE OR WITHOUT REFERENCE TO CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. WAGES ANYTHING THIS BILL PARTICULARLY WILL RESTRICT SOME OF THAT AND TO LOOK AT AN AGENCY THAT IS INDUSTRY FUNDED DOCTOR IS COMPLETELY FUNDED BY THE OIL INDUSTRY. VIA S. SURCHARGE THIS ISSUE TO THEM. IT'S HAVE ACTUALLY GONE DOWN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FOR HARVESTING OR FOR GATHERING OR PRODUCING OIL WHERE THE PERMITS HAVE GONE UP IS BECAUSE OF THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT REQUIRES DOT OIL COMPANIES TO ABANDON WELLS. AND SO THEY HAVE TO PULL A PERMIT TO ABANDON WELLS AND BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE WITHIN A TWENTY FOUR MONTH PERIOD. AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE PERMIT INCREASE HAS TAKEN PLACE IT'S NOT A NEW PRODUCTION OR WELL STIMULATION THOUGH STILL AVERAGE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE PERMITS A YEAR AGAIN PRODUCING OIL UNDER THE STRICTEST ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. EVER IN THE IN THE WORLD I WOULD THINK AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST CHALLENGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHERE OUR OIL COMES FROM WHEN WE DON'T PRODUCE IT HERE CREATE JOBS HERE AND KEEP THAT HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF MANY THAT WE EXPORT TO THESE OTHER COUNTRIES I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU GUYS TO DEFINITELY THINK ABOUT WHERE OIL IS PRODUCED BECAUSE CALIFORNIANS HAVE NOT REDUCE THE CONSUMPTION OF OIL IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO VOTE NOW. SENATOR BURGESS. OH SORRY AND I'M SORRY AT CENTER MORE LOCKED. I CAN'T SEE THOSE LITTLE MITES ACUTE MADAM PRESIDENT IT'S NICE TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE SENATOR FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA IT'S AN HONOR. THE SENATOR FROM. KERN COUNTY JUST LAID IT ALL OUT AND SO THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE AND I'M GLAD YOU HAVE THE SENATOR FROM MONTEREY ON THIS BILL BUT- I I'M WONDERING IF IT'S TIME FOR THIS STATE TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AS IT AS IT RELATES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE AMOUNT OF CARBON FOOTPRINT THAT'S PUT OUT. BY SHIPPING THE AMOUNT OF OIL. TO THIS STATE. IS IT'S GOT TO BE A LOT MORE. THAN IF WE WERE TO PRODUCE INTERNALLY. AND MAYBE WE WOULD WE DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF KEEPING. THE EMISSIONS AND ALL THE RELATED AIR QUALITY CONCERNS WE DO A BETTER JOB HERE BUT YET WE ARE CONSTRICTING OURSELVES AND WE'RE SHIPPING IT FROM PLACES THAT DON'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB. SO IT SEEMS A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL TIMES THAT WE WOULD. HAVE SUCH AN AMAZING IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE COUNTRIES THAT. THE SENATOR FROM. BAKERSFIELD JUST ALLUDED TO AND WHAT WE COULD DO IT BETTER AND FROM A NATIONAL DEFENSE STANDPOINT. WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF WE HAD A GOOD. OIL PRODUCING. INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE WEREN'T IMPORTING SO MUCH IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY BECAUSE MOST OF THE FLIGHT. PLANES CHAPTER WILL WE STILL NEED ALL THESE OIL PRODUCTS SO I'M I'M JUST WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR PROP PROFESSORIAL PERSPECTIVE ON MAYBE WE NEED TO RE EVALUATE WHAT WE'RE DOING THANK YOU. CENTER MARK THAT IS A QUESTION AND IF CENTER MONEY IS WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THAT QUESTION THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND THROUGH THE CHAIR GLAD TO RESPOND. SO LET'S NOT CONFUSE WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO STOP OIL PRODUCTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I REPRESENT A COUNTY THAT HAS A LOT OF OIL PRODUCTION IN SOUTHERN MONTEREY COUNTY. NORTHERN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IT REALLY BUILDS ON THE HISTORY OF SUPERVISORS THE THORNY AT AN OIL FIELD. STARTING IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN WHEN WE FIRST ESTABLISH SUPERVISOR OF THORNY AT ANY OIL DRILLING OPERATION THEN IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE WE AMENDED THAT TO INCLUDE IN THAT SUPERVISORS OF FORTY THE PROTECTION OF GROUND WATER. AS PART OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY THAT EVOLVED. TO NINETEEN SIXTY ONE FOR THE PRUDENT OPERATOR. AMENDMENTS THAT SET OUT CERTAIN. PRUDENT OPERATOR REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPERVISORS SO WE'VE GONE FROM NINETEEN FIFTY ONE NINETEEN FIFTEEN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE. NINETEEN SIXTY ONE. NOT PUTTING A DENT IN CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION BUT INCREASING SAFETY WHAT WE SEEK TO DO HERE. THROUGH ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE SPILL. IS TO INCLUDE. A PROACTIVE CONTINGENT OF PRIORITIZING HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AS PART OF THAT CHECKLIST I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WHO REPRESENT CONSTITUENTS WHO LIVE NEAR AROUND OR WORK IN THE OIL FIELDS WOULD SAY THAT AS CALIFORNIAN LEGISLATURE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE AS A PRIORITY PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT SO ALL THIS DOES IS SAY AS PART OF THIS EVOLVING SUPERVISOR A THORNY. LET'S PUT A PRIORITY ON HUMAN HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. AS ONE OF THOSE ITEMS ON THE CHECKLIST DOES NOT STOP OIL PRODUCTION DOES NOT DISCOURAGE OIL PRODUCTION IT PUTS CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH OTHER STATES THAT ARE MINING OIL AS PUTTING HUMAN HEALTH AND HUMAN SAFETY AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT AS A PRIORITY IN FACT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH DOCTOR. IS MAKING IT CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT ALREADY PRIORITIZE HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT THIS IS CATCHING DAGR UP TO WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING WITH OTHER PRODUCTION MECHANISMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS DEBATE TOO MUCH AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR THE JOCKEY AND EVERYONE AS SENSITIVITIES AND CONCERNS ABOUT OIL PRODUCTION NEAR THEIR OWN TOWN OR GAS PRODUCTION NEAR THEIR HOMETOWN OR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS. THIS BILL IS A PRETTY TECHNICAL AND MODEST MEASURE THERE WILL BE TIME I THINK FOR A BROADER DEBATE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OIL AND GAS POLICY AND HOW WE SORT OF SQUARE THAT WITH OUR LIVES ENERGY DEPENDENCE QUESTIONS GLOBAL MARKETS HEALTH AND SAFETY ARE THE BILL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED THOUGH. IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE RIGHT NOW SO I THINK WE IS A GOOD PREVIEW OF AN IMPORTANT FUTURE DEBATE BUT I WOULD JUST ADMIT THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THIS VEHICLE IS THE PLACE FOR THAT I THINK IT'S A IT'S MORE OF A TECHNICAL CLEAN UP FOR DOGGER AND LORD KNOWS THEY NEED IT WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE OIL INDUSTRY OR IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY DOGGER NEEDS TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL GIVEN SOME TOOL TO DO THAT SO. JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT PLUG IN AND RESERVE SOME OF THESE IMPORTANT TOPICS MAYBE FOR A VENUE THAT HAS A. MORE MEAT TO. SO I RESPECT ESCRIBIR. SENATOR BRIDGES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THE JOCKEY A ON THIS BILL USED A PHRASE EVOLVING SUPERVISOR AUTHORITY. IMMEDIATELY REFLEXIVELY BACK. CHRIS MY CREATE SOME CONCERN MY ANTENNAE GO UP WHEN I WHEN I HEAR ABOUT INVOLVING AUTHORITY BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A SERIES OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE BEEN NINE EVOLUTIONS IN WORKPLACE PROTECTION BUT IN THE TOTALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES YOU HAVE A DEPRESSION IN THE MARKETPLACE ITSELF ANNA WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER I THINK IN ITS IT WITH THE TOTALITY OF SO WITHIN A TO TELL THE OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE'RE LOOKING AT AN INDUSTRY. THAT IS BEING PENALIZED. ANNUALLY IN EVERY SINGLE RESPECT. BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE IN IN MY MIND GIVEN THAT WE HAVE THE SOME OF THE BEST WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY ACROSS THE GLOBE BUT YET WE STILL BRING IN THE FOSSIL FUELS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN OUR ECONOMY AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. SORE PENALIZING THE FEW INDUSTRY PLAYERS THAT REMAINING CALIFORNIA AND ARE EXPORTING WHAT I THINK IS A IS A LARGER IS A LARGER AGENDA TO GET AWAY FROM THAT BUT REALITY IS WE'RE NOT READY TO COMPLETELY GET AWAY FROM IT WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION NO DOUBT BUT IT WON'T BE ELIMINATED. SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN WE GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE TO ADD MORE BURDENSOME REGULATIONS INTO AN ON ON TO AN INDUSTRY IT REALLY IS FOR. IT REALLY IS. TO HURT US LONG TERM AND THAT'S WHAT I'M WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AND FOR THOSE THAT THAT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS JUST A BIT NINE. DISCUSSION POINT OR ITS DISCREET IN ITS APPLICATION. TROUBLED APPRECIATED IN THE LARGER CONTEXT IT'S NOT IT'S KILLING IN INDUSTRY ON WHICH WE RELY ECONOMICALLY END FOR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. I WOULD CERTAINLY CERTAINLY SUPPORT A NO VOTE. CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IN AND YOU CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HAVE WHEN THEY SEE BILLS LIKE THIS BECAUSE OF MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE THIS SEED OIL AS THE ENEMY. TO OUR STATE AND TO OUR COUNTRY AND TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND YOU KNOW IF WE COULD CHANGE FROM. OIL COM THE CONSUMPTION TO ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENERGY IN THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR YEARS OR THE NEXT TWELVE AS SOME DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CLAIM THAT WE CAN DO WE COULD BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BUT- YOU KNOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY. WE ARE AN OIL EXPORTER. WE'RE NOT A NET OIL IMPORTER MY FRIENDS WE NEED SOME COMPETITION. BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY MIND THAT ARE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS THAT HAVE TO BUY GAS TO GET TO AND FROM THEIR WORKPLACES SOME OF YOU LIVE IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES WERE. GASOLINE PRICES ARE NOT A BIG ISSUE. THE GASOLINE PRICES ARE BIG ISSUE. IN MY COMMUNITY WHERE I HAVE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS A SOMETIMES DRIVE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ROUND TRIP TO GO TO WORK. I SEE YOUR CITIZENS HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING GASOLINE BUYING FOOD TO BUY MEDICINE. SO THE COMPETITION THAT WE HAVE IS BEING A NET OIL EXPORTER. AND UTILIZING THE NATURAL RESOURCE OF NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT THE UNITED STATES. HAS BEEN A VERY POSITIVE THING IT'S VERY UPSETTING TO ME WHEN I SEE FRIENDS AGO TO. STATES LIKE TENNESSEE. IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS AND TAKE PICTURES OF THE COST OF GASOLINE TO TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A GALLON. AND WHERE ARE WE- WE'RE STILL IN THE FORMS CLOSER TO FIVE DOLLARS A GALLON DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF YEAR THAT YOU. CHECK ON ON THE PRICE OF GASOLINE. WERE PRICE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE THIS IS JUST ADDING MORE. REGULATIONS THE MORE REGULATIONS THAT YOU ADD ON AN INDUSTRY. ON THE MORE ONEROUS IT IS AND MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS FOR THEM TO EXIST. NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BY THE UNITED STATES AND THESE BUSINESS AS WELL. FIND THE PATH TO PEACE RESISTANCE TO WHERE THEY CAN MAKE A PROFIT. AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HERE TO. HIGHLY PROGRESSIVE. AN APPROPRIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS ALLOWING AN INDUSTRY TO. FIVE AS BEST WE CAN MY COLLEAGUES TO MADE A VERY CLEAR POINT THE BRING OIL IN. FROM COUNTRIES THAT HATE OUR GUTS. COUNTRIES SAID IF YOU'RE LGBT WILL SENTENCE YOU TO DEATH OR TO PRISON. PUTS US AT MORE RISK OF HAVING DISASTROUS. OIL SPILLS. ON OUR BEAUTIFUL CLOSE IN OUR BEAUTIFUL BABIES. BOB WE NEED TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING A TOTALITY AND WHILE I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE MY FRIEND SAYING THIS IS THE INVOLVING REGULATORY SCHEME IT IS NOT RELATIVE TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR RESIDENTS AS IT. PERTAINS TO THE IMPORTATION OF THE SAME. AND SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS GLOBALLY WE NEED LOOK AT THIS COMPREHENSIVELY. AND BASED ON THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE BEING REPORTED IT'S PUTTING OUR. PETROLEUM INDUSTRIES AT A SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE THAT ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH SOME OF THE STRONGER SAFETY REGULATIONS KNOWN TO THE PLANET. SO FOR THOSE REASONS LET'S KIND OF PROTECT THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES THEY'RE MAKING US MORE ENERGY INDEPENDENT THAT ARE PROVIDING HOPEFULLY. BOB THE VOLUME OF. PETROLEUM THAT WILL ALLOW US TO REALLY COMPETE TO PROVIDE A LOWER COST ENERGY SOURCE FOR MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIRD OF WHOM. LIVE CLOSE OR NEAR THE POVERTY LINE BUT HAVING TROUBLE MAKING ENDS MEET MONTH TO MONTH. FOR THOSE REASONS LET'S NOT ADD MORE BURDENS TO THEM. LET'S NOT NOTE ANY BE FOURTEEN FORTY. SIGNAL FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER MINING YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU WELL I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS. CLEARLY THIS BILL HAS TOUCHED A NERVE. I WOULD SUBMIT ITS TOUCHED THE WRONG NERVE. THIS BILL. DOES NOT. GO AGAINST PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT MY COLLEAGUES WOULD DRAW A LINE. BETWEEN THE PROTECTION. OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS HAVE DOCTOR PRIORITIZE. PUBLIC HEALTH. WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND TO HAVE A SUPERVISOR IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS. MAKE SURE THAT THAT BOX IS CHECKED. TO ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD NOT IN FORCE. PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AS A PRIORITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ AN ACT RELATING TO IMPLEMENT SENATOR OUT DORADO THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AB ONE SEVENTY BILLS ON THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AND ENSURES THAT CONTRACTED WORKERS CAN HOLD BOTH THEIR EMPLOYER AND CONTRACTING EMPLOYER LIABLE FOR HARASSMENT IN THE ORKPLACE THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT ARE VULNERABLE. LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE OFTEN WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE WERE MOST IN NEED OF PROTECTION FROM HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE THE TREND WE HAVE SEEN ESPECIALLY IN SOME INDUSTRIES LIKE JANITORIAL AND HOTEL SERVICES HAS BEEN TOWARDS OUTSOURCING WORK TO STAFFING AGENCIES. THE SUBCONTRACTOR WORKERS GO TO WORK EACH DAY THE SAME LOCATION WEARING MANY TIMES THE UNIFORM OF THE OFFICE OR HOTEL THEIR CLEANING AND REPORTING TO SUPERVISORS ON SITE HOWEVER THESE CONTRACTING COMPANIES AND HOTELS ARE NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE ONE SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAPPENS. ON THEIR WATCH TO THEIR WORK. THE RESULT OF A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE BEEN HORROR STORIES OF ABUSES IN THE WORKPLACE. PERPETRATED BY THE SAME ACTORS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. EMPLOYERS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DODGE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING A SAFE WORKPLACE. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY OUTSOURCE WORK TO CONTRACTING COMPANIES THIS BILL IS INSPIRED BY THE STORY OF SOUND UP THIS GATHER. A HOTEL WORKER WHO BRAVELY CAME FORWARD TO TELL HER STORY OF BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED BY THE CONTRACTOR ON THE JOB. B ONE SEVENTY WOULD ENSURE THAT SUBCONTRACTED WORKERS LIKE SANDRA CAN SEEK RECOURSE FROM BOTH THE DIRECT EMPLOYER AND CONTRACTED EMPLOYER. IF THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY FORM OF HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. EMPLOYERS TO BE LIABLE FOR THE ACTS OF THEIR CONTRACTED SUPERVISORS. EMPLOYERS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT AND WELL BEING OF ALL OF THE WORKERS THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO THEIR WORKPLACE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR MOORLACH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I JUST HELLO CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE WE DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO DETERMINE THAT THOSE WE EITHER HIGHER OR THOSE THAT WE CONTRACT WITH HAVE DONE. THE PROPER VETTING IMPROPER. REVIEW OF THOSE THAT WILL BE IN SUPERMAJORITY POSITIONS BUT REGRETFULLY PEOPLE LIE. AND YOU CAN HIRE SOMEONE YOU THINK IS REALLY A COMPETENT MANAGER SUPERVISOR WHEN THERE MAY BE A HIDDEN PAST THAT KIND OF COMES TO SURPRISE YOU SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW FAR THE BILL GOES I JUST RECENTLY WHOPPING 70% OF HIRING MANAGERS HAVE CUT APPLICANTS PUTTING FABRICATIONS ON THE ROUTE TO MAYES. IT'S JUST BEING TO BE A MILLENNIAL THING MAYBE PERHAPS. BUT TERM. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE ARTICLE SAID SORRY. AND THAT'S AN ALMOST 20% INCREASE SINCE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT WHEN FIFTY EIGHT SPOTTED ARE RIGHT EXAGGERATIONS YADA YADA COLLEAGUES. WE HIRED A MANAGER THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. THAT HAD A HISTORY THAT JUST DID NOT. COME OUT AND ALL THE RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE IT TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF OUR- WORSE HARASSMENT INCIDENTS EVER. I GUESS THE MEMBER VOLUNTEERING FOR NONPROFIT THEIR BOARD WIN THROUGH A COMPLETE ANALYSIS AND HIRED AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TURNED OUT THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY AN ATTEMPTED MURDER MAY FINALLY FOUND IN MANY WAS THE EXECUTOR OF THINGS HAPPEN I JUST I WANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST TO RUN BUSINESSES. AND HAVE THE JEOPARDY THE RISK OF RETAINING SOMEONE THAT HAS A HIDDEN PAST THE DOUBLE LIFE AND MAYBE THIS BILL JUST GOES A JUST A TAD TOO FAR BECAUSE WE WANT TO GO AFTER THE PERPETRATORS. WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF. THE ISSUE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANNA LOSE A TEAM MEMBER BY A BAD SUPERVISOR BUT WE'VE ALSO GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW HOW HARD THE HAMMER HITS. AND WITH THAT I HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE- FLOOR MANAGER PROVIDING MAYBE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION TO MAKE ME FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. SENATE PURCHASE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I TO SHARE SOME CONCERNS I THINK. OF THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. OZ HEART IN THERE IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE WE'VE SEEN. WE SEE WORKPLACE HARASSMENT AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN WITH CONTRACTORS IN CONTRACT DIS. SO WE KNOW IT EXISTS. BUT THERE'S ALSO A PRINCIPLE IN LAW. AND IT IS KNOWN OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF AN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP OR WITH CONTRACT DIS. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PROPER VETTING IF THERE'S AN EMPLOYER OR A CONTRACTOR DEALING WITH CONTRACT THESE TO DO THERE ARE TO DO THEIR BEST TO DEVELOP THOSE CANDIDATES. AND IN A SCENARIO THAT THAT THAT THE NEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS INDIVIDUAL POSED A RISK. BUT I THINK THIS MIGHT BE GOING IN. IN UNINTENDED DIRECTION AS WELL IS THAT WE COULD BE DISCOURAGING. BUSINESSES FROM HIRING CONTRACTORS IN WORKING WITH CONTRACT DIS. EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IS BEING BROUGHT IN HOUSE I THINK WITH THIS LEGISLATION IT'S DISCOURAGING EMPLOYERS FROM REACHING OUT INTO INTO THE COMMUNITY AND IN HIRING FOLKS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN IN THE HOUSE OR IN THE SHOP IN SO I THINK THIS HAS BEEN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE BUT I THINK DERAILS IT I WOULD I WOULD CAUTION MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS MAY SOUND ODD AS IF IT IS PURSUING JUSTICE IN MAKING CERTAIN THE INDIVIDUALS ARE SAFE IN THE WORKPLACE. BUT THE INDICATE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES COULD VERY WELL CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE I WOULD I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO CAST A NO VOTE IN ITS CURRENT FORM. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. AT CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I'VE BEEN A. MICROPHONE DON'T WANT TO STAND UP. I HAVE BEEN A I THINK A RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER NOW FOR THE PAST THIRTY SEVEN YEARS. AND WE'VE GOT OUR EMPLOYEES AS BEST WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT. WE'RE HIRING HONORABLE PEOPLE THAT RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR RANKS AND. BILL VERY FORTUNATE THAT IN THE PAST THIRTY SEVEN YEARS THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CLAIM OF OUR HARASSMENT LEVIED AGAINST ANY OF MY BUSINESSES. CAM KNOCKING ON WOOD WHEN I SAY THAT THANK YOU. BUT THIS BILL. CAN REALLY COST SOME MAJOR ISSUES FOR BUSINESS PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT DO ALL THEY CAN. WITH THE LAWS THAT EXIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET ME REMIND YOU ABOUT THE KIND OF LAWS THAT WE BEEN. ENTERTAINING HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THERE'S BEEN A MOVEMENT HERE THAT WE WANT TO GET CRIMINALS. REHABILITATED AN EMPLOYEE AID. AND YET WE DON'T WANT THE EMPLOYERS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT CRIMINAL HISTORY TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE A FRESH START IN LIFE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE DON'T DO THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF VETTING THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO NOT HIRE AN INDIVIDUAL BASED ON THEIR FELONIOUS PAST. THEN WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY HOLD THAT BUSINESS AT A DEEP POCKET LIABILITY FOR. ISSUES OUTSIDE THEIR CONTROL. AND THERE VETTING PROCESSES THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CABBIE OUGHT TO THIS LEGISLATION THAT IF A LEAD IF AN EMPLOYER GOES THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS. THAT ARE NECESSARY AT THE TIME OF A HIGHER TO ENSURE THAT. THEY'RE HIRING SOMEBODY THAT DOES NOT POSE A RISK. TO ANY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES THAT THEY SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THE DEEP POCKET LIABILITY OF. OF THIS BILL. LOOK AT THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL MY FRIENDS WERE TALKING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND SEE THIS. AS A LIGHTNING ROD ISSUE. AS A POTENTIAL JOB KILLER BILL. WE NEED TO BE MORE HOSPITABLE TO EMPLOYERS AT A TIME WHEN MANY ARE FLEEING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TRY TO RETAIN THOSE AND FOSTER A BUSINESS FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT SO THAT PEOPLE WILL COME HERE. TO DO COMMERCE BECAUSE LET ME SAY I BELIEVE THE DAY OF RECKONING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS COMING. IT'S COMING BECAUSE I CALL IT DEATH BY A THOUSAND SLICES EMPLOYERS ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN A HOSTILE STATE. THAT IS NOT RESPECTIVE UP THE GOOD WORK THAT EMPLOYERS TRY TO DO NOT ONLY TO IMPROVE COMMERCE. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDING JOBS AND REVENUE AND AT THE SAME TIME DOING THE BEST THEY CAN. BUT WHETHER YOU HAVE TEN EMPLOYEES ARE TWENTY EMPLOYEES LIKE MYSELF OR MORE TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE HIRING. ARE GOING TO. RESPONSIBLE SUPERVISORS FOR THE PEOPLE OVER WHICH THERE OVERSEEING. LET'S NOT KILL THE BABY WITH THE BATHWATER LET'S RECOGNIZE THOSE GOOD LAWYERS TO TAKE THE EXTRA STEP TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THEY HIRE. ARE RESPONSIBLE JURORS BUT THAT'S ALSO. I EMPLOYERS NOT TO HAVE THE FULL ODIOUS HISTORY OF AN EMPLOYEE A POTENTIAL EMPLOYEE A POTENTIAL SUPERVISOR TO SAFEGUARD THE EMPLOYEES THAT THAT BUSINESS ALREADY HAS FOR THOSE REASONS. AND MANY MORE HIGHER TO NOTE VOTE IN AB ONE SEVEN. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN CENTER DRAWS YOU MAKE COULD CONCLUDE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES OF REAR COMMENTS THERE IS UNINTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE AND THAT IS THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK IN THAT WORKPLACE FOR THAT COMPANY. THAT THEY GET THE SAME RGHTS AND PROTECTIONS AS THE PEOPLE THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT THEY'RE WORKING IN AND AROUND THE- THIS IS NOT. OUTSOURCING SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE FOR A DOUBLE STANDARD A DOUBLE STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AS MEN AND WOMEN LET'S DO BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT POLLS A STANDARD FOR ALL WORKERS. IT SHOULDN'T BE ONE OR THE OTHER AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT HOSTILITY I DON'T% THINK THERE SHOULD BE HOSTILITY TO EMPLOYERS BUT I ALSO DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROTECT HOSTILITY TO MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO I REALLY HOPE SYSTEM I'M SORRY. THE BROTHERS COLLEAGUES OF THAT WE LOOK AT THIS IN A WAY THAT IF YOU HAVE A WORKPLACE AT SOME OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN THEY'RE ALL MIXED IN WITH OTHER MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE WORKING IN THE SAME PLACE AND THERE'S THIS LOOPHOLE OF BEING A CONTRACTED OUT EMPLOYEE SOMEHOW YOU DON'T HAVETHE SAME RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS I DON'T THINK ANY BUSINESS SHOULD FUNCTION THAT WAY SO THIS IS. MEANT TO NOT HAVE A DOUBLE STANDARD IN THE WORKPLACE BUT TO HAVE THE SAME STANDARD OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

PARTICULARLY OR A BILL BRADLEY. AND YES EVEN CHICO. AND THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE YEARS. THE OVERALL PLAN TO REHABILITATE THE COUNTY.

THIS IS A PART OF THE SHORTER TERM PLAN. TO GET ACCOMMODATIONS BACK IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE POPULATION. I ASK AND I WILL. SIR ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER AYE KOWSKI MEN PRESENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE AND I'M NOT I'M I'M KEENLY AWARE OF THE DISASTER THAT OCCURRED IN PARADISE BUT TO SEEK WERE. SEE QUIRK. LEGISLATION BEFORE HAS DOES NOTHING FOR THE CITY OF PARADISE EVERY BUILDING EVERY HOME EVERY BUSINESS THAT WAS BURNED OUT IN PARADISE HAS AN ABSOLUTE. RIGHT TO REBUILD EXACTLY AS IT WAS THEIR EXAM WHAT I OBJECT TO IS THIS IS A FOR COUNTY SEVEN CITY SEQUEL EXEMPTION SOME OF THE CITIES ARE FIFTY MILES AWAY FROM. NICE ORAL IN THIS ON THE FIVE. SEVERAL OTHER CITIES ALONG THE FIVE YUBA CITY IS ABOUT FORTY MILES AWAY I MEAN IF I HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE IN MY DISTRICT IN HEY WERE IN FREMONT CALIFORNIA I'M NOT LOOKING TO BUILD HOUSES FIFTY MILES AWAY IN SAN FRANCISCO OR GILROY CALIFORNIA. THE BILL BEFORE US. ALLOWS FOR A MINIMUM OF FOUR HOUSES PER ACRE. THE FOUR HOUSES PER ACRE IS CLASSIC SUBURBAN SPRAWL IN THE SEVEN CITIES INTO HAITI MIND IN M. Q. COUNTY AND IF YOU'RE NOT ON PRIME FARMLAND. THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUILD THE HOUSES IN THESE IN THESE AREAS THE PRIME FARMLAND THE LEASING VIEW COUNTY IS ONLY ABOUT 30% OF THE OF THE OF THE COUNTY SO THERE'S A DEFINITION THAT MANY OF US LOOK AT. IN OUR SYMPATHY TO WANT TO HELP OUT THE PEOPLE PARADISE WE'RE LOOKING AT A FOUR COUNTY AREA AROUND IT. I'M CHALLENGE TO FIND. TO FIND OUT WHY THIS HAS TO GO ONE BUT WHAT I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT MANTA PRESIDENT IS THE PRESIDENT THAT THIS BILL. SETS BECAUSE OTHER CITIES AND OTHER COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE HERE IF WE HAVE ADISASTER OTHERS OTHER UNAFFECTED AREAS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO BUY SELL TRAVEL FIFTY MILES FROM ONE OF THESE NEW HOUSES TO GET BACK TO PARADISE IF THAT'S- WHAT THEY WERE WORKING. SO I'M WORRIED THAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO WATCHES AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE. WATCHING THIS LEGISLATION AND SAYING OH MY GOD HERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO DO A SEQUEL EXEMPTION. BECAUSE OF A FIRE FOR AREAS IN CITIES. THAT WERE NOT AFFECTED THE WE'RE NOT AFFECTED AND FINALLY THIS SIX YEAR ERIOD THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL AS I READ IT. THAT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THE ANNEXATION OF LAND IN THE SIX CITIES FURTHER SIX OF THE CITY'S COULD ACTUALLY CHANGE THE INCORPORATION OF SOME LAND THAT'S NOT IN PRIME FARMLAND AND ALLOW FOR UNITS. FOR THE ACRE TO BE. DANCE WITH THAT I WILL BE VOTING NO AN URGENT NO PHONE. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE SEMI MEMBER AND A GOOD FRIEND SENATOR FROM TO HEMA AND MYSELF TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD WE HAD A VIGOROUS DISCUSSION I WANNA SHARE FIRST A MINUTE ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT CAMPFIRE AND IT'S IN MOST PEOPLE THINK OF PARADISE BUT THERE'S A COMMUNITY ABOVE PARADISE WHICH IS WE GET A WHICH I FORMALLY REPRESENTED IN THE ASSEMBLY I DON'T HAVE ANY OF YOU COUNTY MY SENATE SEAT BUT- I HAD NINETEEN THOUSAND CONSTITUENTS IN. BUTTE COUNTY AND ELEVEN THOUSAND THEM WERE DISPLACED BY THE CAMPFIRE. WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO.

HE'S TALKING ABOUT BUT YOU HAVE TO IF YOU VISITED THE AREA AND YOU SEE WHERE THE COMMUNITIES ARE. AND HOW THEY ARE MORE SPREAD OUT IN THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE. YOU HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THE YOUR SPEAR IN THAT ONE AREA WHERE THE FIRE WAS AND WE HAD THIS BILL UP IN EQ IN THE GOOD SENATOR. AND I DEBATED ABOUT THE BILL THIS BILL DOES NOT ALLOW A CITY OR COUNTY TO. GO OUTSIDE THEIR GENERAL PLANS AND IF YOU'VE BEEN IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND UNDERSTAND WHAT A GENERAL PLAN DOES IT'S THE PLAN IT IS BEEN LAID OUT. THROUGH THE LAW TO BUILD OUT YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THIS BILL WILL SIMPLY ALLOW THEM TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS WITH IN THE GENERAL PLANS OF THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE DESIGNATED. IN THIS BILL. THIS IS A GOOD BILL IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SHOW THE PEOPLE WHEN YOU'VE HAD A NATURAL DISASTER YOUR COMMUNITY. THE LARGEST IN THE NATION AMONG THE MOST DEVASTATING WILDFIRE IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY. HAPPENED RIGHT IN OUR BACKYARD. I THINK IT IS WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS FOR THIS LEGISLATURE NOT TO ALLOW US TO BUILD HOMES FOR THOSE FOLKS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AROUND AND REBUILD THE NOR STATE SO I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL WE HAD BIGGEST DEBATE AND THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO HELPING PEOPLE GET BACK ON THEIR FEET.
