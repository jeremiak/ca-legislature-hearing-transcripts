NEIGHBORHOODS WE LIVED IN AND

00:28:30.676 --> 00:28:35.214 region:rollup2
THE VIOLENCE AND CRIME THAT WE

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:39.718 region:rollup2
I DID ATTEND SCHOOL.

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:41.453 region:rollup2
BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF

I WOULD HIDE FOOD IN THE CLOSET.

00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:49.995 region:rollup2
I CAN REMEMBER IT BEING A BOX OF

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:55.534 region:rollup2
KICKS FROM THE WAKE THAT MY

00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:56.935 region:rollup2
MOTHER HAD RECEIVED.

00:28:55.534 --> 00:29:00.005 region:rollup2

YEARS OLD I REMEMBER.

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:10.549 region:rollup2

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:14.152 region:rollup2
IN MY STOMACH.

00:29:12.651 --> 00:29:15.487 region:rollup2
I COULD WAIT I COULDN'T WAIT FOR

00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:17.422 region:rollup2
LUNCH BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THAT

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:18.857 region:rollup2
WAS THE ONLY MALE I COULD I

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:20.692 region:rollup2

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:22.861 region:rollup2
GROWING UP.

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:27.132 region:rollup2
ALL I CRAVED WAS TO BE NORMAL

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:29.701 region:rollup2
AND TO FIT IN WITH OTHER KIDS.

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:31.336 region:rollup2
AS A MOTHER WITH TWO KIDS.

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:33.238 region:rollup2

WE CURRENTLY LIVE WITH MY MOTHER

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:41.980 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HOW THE HOUSING IN

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:44.883 region:rollup2
CONCERT COSTA COUNTY IS VERY

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:50.188 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE. FOR A ONE BEDROOM

APARTMENT IT IS ABOUT.

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:52.624 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:56.128 region:rollup2
THAT CASH AID I RECEIVED WENT.

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:58.330 region:rollup2
TO PAIN UTILITIES FOOD AND GAS.

00:29:56.128 --> 00:30:01.700 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD AFFORD

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:03.101 region:rollup2
TO LIVE ON MY OWN.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.038 region:rollup2
IF THE CASH GRANT [inaudible]

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:08.840 region:rollup2
WAS RAISED.

00:30:06.038 --> 00:30:09.975 region:rollup2
WHAT I WOULD DO HONESTLY IS TO

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.611 region:rollup2
PROVIDE OF MY ELDEST SON WHICH

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:13.879 region:rollup2

00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:15.714 region:rollup2
HE WOULD.

00:30:13.879 --> 00:30:17.916 region:rollup2
GO AROUND WHICH SHOES THAT

00:30:15.714 --> 00:30:19.618 region:rollup2
DIDN'T FIT.

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:19.918 region:rollup2
THAT HAD HOLES IN THE BOTTOM

00:30:19.618 --> 00:30:21.553 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:24.056 region:rollup2
HIS SOCKS.

FOR BOYS GROW UP SO FAST.

00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:31.363 region:rollup2
HE WOULD WALK AROUND WITH PANTS

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:36.635 region:rollup2
THAT WERE TOO SHORT.

00:30:31.363 --> 00:30:37.869 region:rollup2
AND HE OFTEN GOT TEASED.

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:41.373 region:rollup2
IT BREAKS MY HEART [inaudible]

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:46.344 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT BRINGS ME BACK TO

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:48.313 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS A KID.

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:49.681 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE SHAME.

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:52.684 region:rollup2
OF WEARING CLOTHES.

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:54.486 region:rollup2
THAT DIDN'T FIT.

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:57.789 region:rollup2
OF OTHER KIDS TEASING.

00:30:54.486 --> 00:31:00.392 region:rollup2

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:02.627 region:rollup2
TO THEIR SELF ESTEEM YOU HAVE.

00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:03.562 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU CAN WALK INTO A STORE

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.496 region:rollup2

IT'S WHAT I CAN AFFORD.

00:31:15.107 --> 00:31:20.846 region:rollup2

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:21.880 region:rollup2
THAT YOU FILL.

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:24.116 region:rollup2

VIEW THIS BILL WITH AN ESSENTIAL

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:23.652 region:rollup2
PROTECTION OF CAO WORKS

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:25.488 region:rollup2
RECIPIENTS WHO ARE REQUIRED BY

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:26.389 region:rollup2
LAW FEDERAL ESTATE LAW TO HAVE

SYSTEM.

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:31.527 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:33.129 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ARE CAL WORKS

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.530 region:rollup2
RECIPIENTS GET INTO.

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:36.365 region:rollup2
WHICH I'M REALLY KIND OF A

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:38.100 region:rollup2
BRIDGE THERE THEIR EMPLOYMENT

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:39.402 region:rollup2
RIGHTS IN THEIR COUPLE THINGS

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.403 region:rollup2
ALL AT MISTRANSLATED AND SPEAK

01:15:39.402 --> 01:15:41.470 region:rollup2
TO THIS ALSO.

01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:43.272 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THERE ARE TWO SUCH

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:45.841 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE REALLY

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:47.276 region:rollup2
WORRY ABOUT ONE IS THE

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:48.511 region:rollup2
UNPREDICTABILITY OF SCHEDULED

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:51.380 region:rollup2
HOURS.

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:53.783 region:rollup2
SO WE FREQUENTLY SEE --

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.584 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO THE COUNTY WILL SAY

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:57.319 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA GET TWENTY HOURS A

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:59.121 region:rollup2
WEEK AT THE FOR THE TARGET STORE

01:15:57.319 --> 01:16:00.523 region:rollup2
WELL GUESS WHAT THEY ONLY GET

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:01.891 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED FOR TWELVE HOURS A

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:03.159 region:rollup2
WEEK THREE WEEKS IN A ROW AT THE

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:04.126 region:rollup2
TARGET STORE.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:05.361 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:07.430 region:rollup2
SCHEDULING OF THE TARGET MANAGER

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:08.931 region:rollup2
DOES -- THAT

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:10.499 region:rollup2
CAN LEAD TO A SANCTIONED SO I

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:12.802 region:rollup2
THINK SOMEONE WITH UNPREDICTABLE

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:14.837 region:rollup2
SCHEDULING OUGHT TO BE PROTECTED

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:16.238 region:rollup2
FROM A SANCTION AND IF THEY HAVE

01:16:14.837 --> 01:16:17.540 region:rollup2
TO LEAVE THAT JOB.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.674 region:rollup2
BY BEING ABLE TO COME TO THE

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:20.676 region:rollup2
WELFARE OFFICE AND AND AND TELL

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:22.611 region:rollup2
THE WORKER LOOK I HAVE TO QUIT

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:23.846 region:rollup2
THIS JOB I HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:25.748 region:rollup2

HOURS ADJUST TO UNPREDICTABLE

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:28.818 region:rollup2
AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER THING

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:31.187 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE ARE THERE ARE.

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:31.787 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY SOME UNSCRUPULOUS

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:35.057 region:rollup2

HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS ALL

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:47.703 region:rollup2

CHALLENGE THAT BEHAVIOR --

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:56.846 region:rollup2
BUT IF IT HAPPENS OFTEN TO

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:57.680 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS RECIPIENT BECAUSE THEY

01:16:56.846 --> 01:16:59.448 region:rollup2
