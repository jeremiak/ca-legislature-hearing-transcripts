PAGE FOUR TURNS THOSE NUMBERS

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:39.826
INTO.

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:45.231
WHAT THAT MEANS TO INSURERS?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.201
EXPERIENCE. FOR HOMEOWNERS

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:49.168

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.044
MY KNOWLEDGE THAT IS.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.880
LIKELY A RECORD LOSS RATIO FOR

THE LOSS RATIO FOR HOMEOWNERS

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:12.525
WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND 18%.

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:14.460
THAT WAS THE PREVIOUS HIGH.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:15.795
UNTIL THIS YEAR.

TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:37.783
UNFORTUNATELY FOR EVERY DOLLAR

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.219
THEY WROTE THEY PAID OUT TO

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.687
DOLLARS IN CLAIMS.

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:44.357
IN A GIVES YOU A SENSE HOW THAT.

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.658
PLAYED OUT FOR DIFFERENT

INSURERS THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.394
THE PAGE.

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.129
THE TWO HUNDRED AND 1% IS THE

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.998
OVERALL NUMBER BUT FOR STATE

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:57.770

NATIONWIDE FOUR HUNDRED AND 21%.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.147
SO MASSIVE NUMBERS MORE THAN

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.616
FOUR DOLLARS PAID OUT FOR EVERY --

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:11.584
PREMIUM DOLLAR RECEIVED THAT

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.020
YEAR [inaudible]

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.021
SO.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.389
OBVIOUSLY.

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:19.558
A A TERRIBLE YEAR WE FOLLOW UP

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.761
IF YOU FLIP THE PAGE.

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:24.597
FIVE AND THE NEXT YEAR -- MAJOR

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:26.866

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:31.137
RATIO FOR INSURERS BUT STILL.

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:32.538
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RECORD.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:33.839
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE YEAR

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.207
BEFORE.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.043
AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:38.811
A A COUPLE ANSWERS AGAIN

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:41.681
TRAVELERS AT TWO HUNDRED AND

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.282
TWENTY TWO STATE FARM MUCH

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:45.217
BETTER YEAR FOR THEM.

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:46.819
ALBEIT AN AWFUL YEAR FOR THEM

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.822
LOS WISE AT 89%.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.958
AND JUST TO MENTION AS I

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:53.659
MENTIONED THE POLICIES WRITTEN

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:56.595
INCLUDED DWELLING FIRE POLICIES.

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:58.597
I JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF OUR

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.733
OWN FAIR PLAN THAT IN SURE -- OF

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.335
LAST RESORT.

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:05.571
WHICH RIGHTS A DWELLING FIRE

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:08.407
FORM OF COVERAGE. FOR THE LOSS

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:11.210
RATIO FOR DRAWING FIRE COVERAGE

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.578
REALLY HADN'T EXCEEDED.

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:15.314
HADN'T EXCEEDED A 100% IN THE

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.782
PREVIOUS YEARS.

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:19.885
IT WENT UP TO A HUNDRED AND 64%.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.787
AND THE FAIR PLANS LOSS RATIO

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:25.191
WAS TWO HUNDRED AND 57%.

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:27.093
A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.427
CONCENTRATION.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:31.263
IN THE MALIBU AREA WHERE -- WE

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.199
HAD COURSE SOME OF OUR MAJOR

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.968
FIRES.

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:39.972
SO -- THE NEXT PICTURE JUST.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.841
IN A TO GIVE SOME PERSPECTIVE OF

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:44.210
WHAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES IS A

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:47.346
SOME SCENE FROM THE CAMPFIRE --

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.548
IN THAT SCENE YOU SEE -- JUST

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:52.551
LAST WEEK COMMISSIONER.

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:55.921
LARA LED A ANY I SEE SPONSORED

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:58.791
WILD FAR CAN SYMPOSIUM.

00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:00.960
AND LEAD -- FELLOW COMMISSIONERS

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:03.896
FROM UTAH AND WASHINGTON.

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:08.234
AND OREGON UP -- TO PARADISE. TO

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.137
KINDA TO MEET WITH THE TOWN

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:13.539
LEADERSHIP -- HERE FROM

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:18.577
CONSUMERS AND AND GET A SENSE OF

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:19.879
THE LEVEL OF DOES THE

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:21.614
DEVASTATION IN THAT AREA THAT

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.382
YOU REALLY.

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:26.318
HE HE DON'T APPRECIATE UNTIL YOU

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:30.156
ACTUALLY SEE IT -- LET ME FLIP

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:35.094
TO THE NEXT SLIDE.

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:36.996
THESE ARE THE CLAIMS ISSUES THAT

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.597
ARISE AFTER.

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.366
A WHILE FIRE.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:43.436
UNDER INSURANCE IS THE THEME

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:44.603
THAT.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.871
YOU CAN YOU HAS BEEN REPEATED

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.006
SENSE.

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:51.143
OF WILDFIRE LOSSES FOR SINCE TWO

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.778
THOUSAND THREE OR SEVEN DURING.

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:55.181
OR MY ENTIRE EXPERIENCE IN

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:56.615
NINETY ONE ACTUALLY.

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:58.050
ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN WITH THE

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.285
DEPARTMENT EVERY TIME THERE'S

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.387
BEEN A WILDFIRE THERE'S BEEN AN

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:03.155
UNDER INSURANCE ISSUE.

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.057
AND I I GUESS I JUST POSE TO

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.460
EVERYBODY HERE -- WHEN YOU THINK

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:10.229
ABOUT HOW THIS ARISES IS TO

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:11.964
THINK OF YOUR OWN HOME OWNER'S

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:13.199
POLICY?

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:15.568
AND HOW DID THE LIMIT THAT YOU

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.103
HAVE THERE TODAY.

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:20.106
EVOLVE TO BE THERE LIKE WHO

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.607
CHOSE THAT NUMBER.

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:24.376
HOW DID THAT NUMBER? TWO HOWEVER

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:25.544
MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:26.979
IS.

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.647
IT HAVE YOU HAD A RECENT

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.116
INTERACTION WITH YOUR AGENT.

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:31.417
IS THAT THE NUMBER THAT SOMEBODY

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:33.419
SUGGESTED TEN YEARS AGO AND IT

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:35.988
JUST KEPT RENEWING WITH SMALL IN.

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:38.090
PLACE IN FACTORS.

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:40.392
SO FOR ME MOST INSURANCE THAT I

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:42.728
TALKED TO IT IS THE NUMBER THAT

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:43.996
CAME FROM THEIR INSURER.

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:46.165
AND THAT THEY ACCEPTED THAT

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.967
NUMBER AND THAT NUMBER HAS MOVED

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:49.135
FORWARD.

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.469
EITHER THROUGH INFLATION OR

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:52.938
HOWEVER IN SIR -- SUGGESTED OVER

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:54.573
MANY DECADES IN THE MEANTIME IF

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.041
THEY RENEWED WITH THE SAME

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:56.742
ANSWER.

00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:58.911
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT YOU CAN

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:01.780
HAVE ANYWHERE IN THE STATE.

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.716
OF COURSE AND FOR ANY ONE OF US

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:06.819
BECAUSE THE MOST PEOPLE AREN'T

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.687
TOO THRILLED TO TALK ABOUT

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:10.356
INSURANCE OR EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:13.025
MOST FOLKS LIKE TO WRITE THAT

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:15.361
PREMIUM GRUDGINGLY THE CHECK

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:17.062
SEND IT OFF AND NOT HAVE TO

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.364
THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.733
WHICH IS AN ISSUE SINCE IT'S FOR

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:23.736
MOST PEOPLE THEIR PRIMARY --

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:26.071
INVESTMENT IN IN YOU KNOW THAT

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.339
THEY HAVE IN LIFE.

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:28.908
SO SO IT IS AN ISSUE THE

00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:31.443
CONTINUES AND IT IS A IT IS A

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.079
MAJOR DIFFICULTY FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.348
OBVIOUSLY WANT TO REBUILD.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.083
OR RESTART THEIR LIFE AFTER

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.485
THEY'VE HAD A TOTAL LOSS LIKE

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:42.188
THIS -- I'M HOPING IT'S

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:43.756
SOMETHING WE CAN ADDRESS -- WITH

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.391
SOME LEGISLATION.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:47.660
DEMAND SURGED OCCURS OF COURSE

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:50.529
IN THESE -- WILD FOR VINCE THAT

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:53.365
IS -- OCCURS BEYOND INSURANCE TO

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:56.101
CONTROL BUT INSURANCE POLICIES

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.636
ACCOUNT FOR THAT WITH AN

00:13:57.703 --> 00:14:00.105
EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST.

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.942
COVERAGE THAT IS ON ALMOST EVERY

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:04.476
SINGLE HOMEOWNER'S POLICY.

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:06.178
SOME INSURERS MAKE THAT AN

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:07.613
OPTIONAL COVERAGE.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.283
WE HOPE THAT EVERYONE WITH BY.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.719
AT A MINIMUM TWENTY FIVE OR 50%

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:16.488
AND EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST TO

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:18.224
ADDRESS DEMAND SURGE.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.992
OR THE FACT THAT AN ESTIMATE CAN

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.760
BE AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.829
REPLACEMENT COST.

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:26.232
THE OTHER MAJOR COMPLAINT WE GET.

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:29.068
IS ABOUT THE INVENTORY PROCESS

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:30.703
FOR GETTING YOUR PERSONAL

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:31.971
PROPERTY RECOVERY.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:33.939
NONE OF WE WANT TO GO INTO

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:36.275
DETAIL ABOUT IT BUT ESSENTIALLY

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:38.210
TO RECOVER THE CONTENTS COVERAGE

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.712
UNDER YOUR POLICY.

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:41.247
YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A LIST OF

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:43.249
EVERY ITEM YOU OWN.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:45.417
AND THE AGE OF THAT ITEM HOW

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:47.186
MUCH YOU PAID IN THE CONDITION

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:48.487
OF THAT ITEM.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.456
THE IN SIR -- WOULD EVALUATE

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:53.158
EACH AND EVERY ITEM SEPARATELY.

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.827
AND THEN DETERMINE AN ACTUAL

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:57.930
CASH VALUE A DEPRECIATED VALUE.

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.498
FOR MOST ITEMS PAY YOU THAT

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.400
MONEY AND THEN AS YOU REPLACE

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:04.436
THE ITEM YOU GET THE REPLACEMENT

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:05.904
COST FOR THE ITEM.

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:09.141
SO IT IS A PAINSTAKING PROCESS.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:12.645
WHICH IS PARTICULARLY HEIGHTENED

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:14.647
WHEN YOU'RE IN THESE SCENARIOS

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:15.614
WHERE YOU ARE HAVING TO MOVE

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.783
MILES AWAY IT'S NOT LIKE A ONE

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.318
OFF FIRE WHERE YOU CAN FIND A

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:19.952
HOME.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:22.021
SOMEWHERE NEARBY BUT YOU ARE

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:23.889
MOVING MILES AWAY FREQUENTLY

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.124
PUTTING YOUR KIDS I DIFFERENT

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.125
SCHOOLS.

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:28.127
ALL KINDS OF ISSUES AND HAVING

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:29.695
TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.864
IS EXCRUCIATING IS THE WORD THAT

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.099
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD USE TO

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:34.767
DESCRIBE IT.

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.101
I WOULD SAY A LOT OF THE

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:39.672
INSURERS HAVE BEEN GREAT IN.

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:42.408
IN ALLOWING INSERT INSERTS NOT

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:44.143
TO HAVE TO DO THE ENTIRE

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:46.845
INVENTORY TO GET MAJOR PORTIONS

00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:47.980
OF THAT.

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:50.015
RECOVERY BACK SO INSURERS HAVE

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:52.718
WAIVED AS MUCH AS 75% OF THEIR

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.254
LIMITS AND IN A COUPLE CASES A

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:57.523
100% OF THEIR LIMITS. TO SAVE

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:59.124
PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.193
THAT PROCESS WHICH IS THAT YOU

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.629
WILL HEAR ABOUT THAT ANY CLAIM

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.030
HOLDER OF AND YOU GO.

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:06.432
TO THIRD TIME LIMITATIONS ON

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:08.634
COVERAGES SOME OF THOSE WERE

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.302
ADDRESSED IN LAST RECENT

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:12.071
LEGISLATION.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.839
AND THERE ARE OBJECTIONS

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.808
CURRENTLY TO LAND VALUES BEING

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:18.277
DEDUCTED WHEN REPLACING THE HOME

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:19.545
AT ANOTHER LOCATION.

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.647
I WILL SAY IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:23.048
FORTUNATE TO HAVE.

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:25.317
A LAW THAT ALLOWS A PERSON TO

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.286
TAKE THEIR INSURANCE RECOVERY

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.388
AND INSISTS THAT CHOOSE TO BUY

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:30.656
OR BUILD A HOME AT ANOTHER

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:31.957
LOCATION.

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.459
THAT'LL PROBABLY BE.

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:36.028
COME INTO PLAY IN A BIG WAY IN

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:37.796
THE PARADISE AREA.

00:16:37.863 --> 00:16:40.432
BUT IF THE REPLACEMENT COST OF

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:41.533
THE HOME IN THE INSURANCE

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.769
PAYMENT IS.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:44.370
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THE

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.939
CONSUMER WANTS TO GO BUY A HOUSE.

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.941
AND PIECE A LAND ALL TOGETHER

00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:50.843
THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.378
SOME IN SERVICE THE DOC THAT

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:55.381
LAND VALUE AND SAY NO WE'RE ONLY

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:56.749
WE ONLY INSURE THE HOME.

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:58.183
A TO GET REPLACEMENT FULL

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.551
REPLACEMENT COST ON HOME YOU

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:01.186
HAVE TO SPEND THAT MUCH ON THE

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:04.289
HOME NOT THE LAND AND THE HOME

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:05.824
AND THE LA DOT THE LAND VALUE.

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.860
WHICH ENDS UP ARGUABLY IS A

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:09.728
WINDFALL TO THE INSERT -- IF

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.663
THAT HAPPENS THE PERSON NEVER

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.165
GETS THE REPLACEMENT COST.

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.600
SO THERE'S AN ARGUMENT.

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:16.502
BOTH WAYS ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:18.470
APPROPRIATE BUT IT DOES MAKE

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:20.606
MOVING ON MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:21.440
CONSUMER.

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:23.809
SENSUALLY THEY'D HAVE TO BUY A

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:24.410
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:25.611
PROPERTY IF THEY WANTED TO GET

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:27.679
THEIR WHOLE FIVE HUNDRED

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.615
THOUSAND BACK.

00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:30.249
WHICH JUST KEEP CREATES KIND OF

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:33.752
A IN THE WHOLE PROCESS ITSELF.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.053
MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE WITH

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.755
THE INSURERS CONTROL OBVIOUSLY

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.624
THEY CAN THEY COULD ADDRESS THE

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:42.060
UNDER INSURANCE ISSUE BY MORE --

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.662
ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.097
REPLACEMENT COST.

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:47.900
BY COMPLETE A BETTER EXTENDED

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:49.968
REPLACEMENT COST TAKEN LABOR

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:52.104
DEAL WITH PERSONAL PROPERTY AS

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.272
THE CHOOSE.

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:55.607
AND THEY CAN DEAL WITH THE LAND

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.810
ISSUE AS THEY CHOOSE SO THEY CAN

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.545
BE MORE LIBERAL.

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:02.648
THEN THERE ARE THE NO LAW MIGHT

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:04.483
REQUIRE OF THEM IF THEY CHOSE TO

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.251
DO SO.

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:07.986
THE BIG ISSUE THAT WE ARE SEEING

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:10.622
NOW AS WE DO THESE WILDFIRE

00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:13.959
WORKSHOPS -- TO HELP CLAIMANTS.

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:16.762
IS THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT WE HEAR

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:19.631
MORE AND MORE -- IS PARTICULARLY

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:21.467
BOTH FROM SANTA ROSA WERE SO

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.168
MUCH OF THE TOWN WAS DEVASTATED

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:25.170
AND THEN.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:27.039
EVEN GREATER DEVASTATION OF

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.740
COURSE IN PARADISE.

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:31.543
AND TO THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA OF

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.912
THEIR WHOLE TOWN BEING

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:34.847
DEVASTATED.

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:38.150
REALLY HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON ON

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:40.152
HOW MUCH THEY EVEN WANT TO GO

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.087
BACK AND TRY TO REBUILD RIGHT SO

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.956
THEY'RE THEY'RE A LOT THAT'S

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:45.958
COMING INTO PLAY.

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:48.460
AND NOW THE MORE RECENT CONCERN

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:50.863
IS ON THE RENEWAL PROCESS SO

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:52.231
PEOPLE WONDERING.

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:53.499
AM I GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP MY

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:55.400
COVERAGE OR WILL I BE ABLETO

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.703
AFFORD COVERAGE IF I REBUILD IN

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.271
PARADISE FOR EXAMPLE.

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:00.739
WILL I BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:03.008
COVERAGE FOR THAT NEW A NEWLY

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.210
REBUILT HOME.

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:06.945
AND I WOULD SAY I'D WELCOME IF

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:08.347
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ALONG THE

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:10.249
WAY YOU'RE WELCOME TO INTERRUPT

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:11.283
AND I'LL.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.819
DO MY BEST TO ANSWER SO -- FEEL

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:16.555
FREE TO DO SO.

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:18.323
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.991
IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION.

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.559
THIS.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:24.263
ABSOLUTELY UNDER INSURANCE -- IS

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.366
THERE A WHAT.

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:29.167
MOTIVATES D. MOTIVATES INSURANCE

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:31.036
COMPANIES FROM KEEPING A CLOSER

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.504
EYEON THAT ANDNOT.

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.473
ENCOURAGING THEIR CUSTOMERS

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:34.773
[inaudible]

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.809
TO INCREASE THEIR INSURANCE.

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:40.178
YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE --

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:41.880
HEY THIS MEANS MORE PREMIUM TO

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:44.650
YOU AND CERTAIN COMPANY RIGHT IF

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.285
YOU INCREASE THE LIMITS.

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.120
I I I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW YOU

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:49.922
HAVE TWO PARTIES ONE WANTING TO

00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:52.758
SELL ONE WANTING TO BUY A AS

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:55.160
CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE -- AS I SAID

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:56.795
PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY LOVE

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.530
PAYING FOR INSURANCE.

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:00.265
AND A SO THEY'LL AND THE

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.701
LIKELIHOOD OF A TOTAL LOSS IS

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:03.702
VERY SMALL.

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:06.004
SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE TEND TO WANNA

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:08.607
KEEP MINIMIZE THEIR COVERAGE.

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:11.076
THE ANSWER -- REALLY IS THE ONE

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:12.411
WHO KINDA.

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:14.546
MAKES THE FINAL DECISIONS HERE

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:16.448
IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY'RE

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.216
GOING TO INSURE YOU FOR THAT

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:18.951
AMOUNT.

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:21.219
AND THE SERVER IS TYPICALLY THE

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:23.055
ONE THAT SHARES AN ESTIMATE OF

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.222
REPLACEMENT COST.

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:25.924
GENERATED BY WHATEVER VENDOR

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:28.794
THAT THEY CHOOSE TO USE.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.630
AND YOU KNOW THE MOST OF THIS

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.498
DATA I MEAN IT'S AN ERA OF BIG

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:34.099
DATA.

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:36.101
AND AND ACTUALLY YOU CAN FIND

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:37.903
OUT ABOUT MORE DETAILS AMOUNTS

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.072
ANY HOME ONLINE IF YOU LOOK AT

00:20:40.138 --> 00:20:42.274
ZILLOW OR TRULIA OR REALTOR DOT

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:43.108
COM.

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:44.710
SO THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:47.212
AVAILABLE -- I THINK THE INSERTS

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.780
WOULD SAY THE INSERT ISN'T

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:51.550
GIVING THEM ENOUGH DETAILED

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:52.985
INFORMATION TO GET IT RIGHT --

00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:54.853
IN CERTAIN CONSUMERS WOULD SAY

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.588
WOLF YOU KNOW I JUST GETTING THE

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.690
FACTS AND THEN THEN THAT'S THE

00:20:58.757 --> 00:20:59.758
NUMBER THEY GAVE ME.

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.727
BUT HOPEFULLY I THINK IT'S

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:05.097
REALLY HOLDING CONSUMERS. TO BUY

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:08.033
MORE REALISTIC VALUE IS.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.735
A TO ME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:12.137
THE ANSWER -- TODAY -- IT IT

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:14.573
CREATES A COMPETITION PROBLEM IF

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.608
ONE IN SIR -- DOES THAT AND THE

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:17.943
REST OF THE MARKET DOESN'T.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.378
BECAUSE THE IN A LITTLE THEY

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:21.046
WILL BE OUT OF WHACK -- PREMIUM

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.015
WISE TOO EXPENSIVE SO IT REALLY

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:26.752
TAKES THE WHOLE MARKET TO KINDA.

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:29.521
MOVED FORWARD THE SAME TIME.

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.590
THE NEXT SLIDE IS -- ACTUALLY

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:34.393
ARE MAILED THE CLEANS WORKSHOP.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.694
I'M GONNA MENTION SOME OF THE

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:38.263
MANY THINGS THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.665
INSURANCE DOES.

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:42.534
OF A TO HELP HOMEOWNERS ONE OF

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:44.569
THE THINGS WE DID HEAR IT SAYS

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:47.572
MALIBU -- COMMISSIONER LARA SET

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:51.610
UP A A WORKSHOP BOTH A WELL

AND THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE -- THE

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:47.785
CIRCLE ON BUT YEARS DOES MINE

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:48.953
DOESN'T OKAY.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.755
SO GENERALLY WHAT AN INSERT --

00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:53.391
LOOKS AT TODAY.

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:56.194
IS WELL BEYOND JUST THE SINGLE

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.029
PROPERTY HAT THEY ARE UNDER

00:29:58.096 --> 00:29:59.397
WRITING FOR COVERAGE.

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:01.533
THEY LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT BE A TWO

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:02.800
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YARDS OR

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.402
CONFERENCE AROUND THAT PROPERTY

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.171
IT MIGHT BE A MILE WIDE

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:08.006
CIRCUMFERENCE IF THEY'RE TAKING

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:09.007
INTO ACCOUNT.

00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:11.676
WIND OR OTHER ISSUES AND THEY'RE

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.545
LOOKING AT THE SLOPE THE FUEL

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:16.247
LOAD IN TERMS OF BROCHURE TIMBER.

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.482
AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:19.317
ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY AND THIS

00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:21.352
IS ONE OF THE FIRST FILTERS THAT

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.887
YOUR PROPERTY GOES THROUGH.

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.322
SO THIS IS A LOOK UP PERIOD

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:25.523
GRANITE BAY.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.193
THEY MIGHT TAKE AA CIRCLE

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:31.062
AROUND SOME PORTION OF THIS AREA.

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:34.699
TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:35.733
TO ENSURE THAT HOME OR NOT.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.801
USING A MODEL THAT MIKE SCORE

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:38.836
THAT INDIVIDUAL HOME TAKING INTO

00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:40.038
ACCOUNT ALL THAT OTHER

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:41.105
INFORMATION.

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:42.941
ABOUT HOW EASY IT IS TO GET

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:45.210
THERE AND HOW MUCH RISK THERE IS

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:46.611
AROUND THE HOME GENERALLY.

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.680
IF YOUR HOME DOESN'T GET THROUGH

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:50.348
THAT UNDERWRITING FILTER.

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:52.283
IT WON'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE DONE

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.319
EVERYTHING YOU CAN AT YOUR OWN

00:30:54.385 --> 00:30:56.487
PROPERTY. TO MEDIATE

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:56.788
[inaudible]

00:30:56.854 --> 00:30:59.490
THE RISK.

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:01.426
THE NEXT PAGE THIRTEEN ARE THE

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:03.394
UNDERWRITING LOSS.

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:06.397
PEOPLE ASKED WHY DO YOU.

00:31:06.464 --> 00:31:08.032
AT THE DEPARTMENT LET THE

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:10.101
INSURER NON RENEW ME I'VE BEEN

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:12.770
WITH THEM FOR TWENTY YEARS I'VE

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:13.905
NEVER HAD A LOSS.

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:16.441
NOTHING IS CHANGED HERE AND NOW

00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:18.076
I'M BEING NON RENEW.

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:20.645
WELL THERE ARE VERY FEW LAWS

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:22.413
THAT REGULATE INSURANCE OR

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.648
UNDERWRITING.

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.682
THEY ARE BASICALLY THAT AN

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:27.185
ANSWER -- HAS TO USE.

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:30.121
RISK BASED -- DECISION MAKING

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:31.589
AND THEY HAVE TO APPLY IT

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:32.824
CONSISTENTLY.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.325
SO WHEN THEY LOOK AT A RISK THEY

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.861
CAN'T USE THEIR BIASES THAT ARE

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.730
UNRELATED TO LOS.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:40.098
I DON'T LIKE THAT GUY -- IS A

00:31:40.164 --> 00:31:42.300
TROUBLE MAKER IT HAS TO BE ABOUT

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:43.601
RISK.

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:46.537
SO OF WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.873
THE MODELS THAT I MENTIONED ON

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.608
THAT LAST PAGE.

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:52.877
IN SERVERS INCORPORATING THAT

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:55.546
HAS MADE THEM IT'S A NEW SCREEN

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.215
THEY DIDN'T PUT THEIR WHOLE BOOK

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:59.517
THROUGH TEN YEARS AGO WHEN YOU.

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:01.586
CAME ON BOARD AS AN INSURED WITH

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:03.588
THEM NOW THEY USE IT AND NOW YOU

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.189
MIGHT FIND THAT WHILE YOU WERE

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:06.457
PERFECTLY FINE RISK.

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:07.692
UNDER THEIR UNDERWRITING

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.394
GUIDELINES OF TEN YEARS AGO TO

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.096
DATE YOU DON'T MAKE THE CUT.

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:13.498
AND SO THEY SEND OUT A NON

00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:14.999
RENEWAL.

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:15.967
TYPICALLY.

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:19.037
THEY GO WITH THE MANDATE OF THE

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.405
FORTY FIVE DAY NOTICE SOME DO A

00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:21.973
LITTLE LONGER.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.141
TELLING YOU.

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:24.709
YOU KNOW WHEN THIS POLICY WOULD

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:28.246
HAVE WHEN IT EXPIRES ON WHATEVER

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:29.480
JULY FIRST.

00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:31.115
YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE RENEWAL

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:33.084
COVERAGE WITH OUR COMPANY YOU

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:34.719
NEED TO FIND COVERAGE ELSEWHERE

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.854
JUST A QUICK REMINDER YOU HAVE

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:37.522
THREE MINUTES SIR THANK YOU OKAY

00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:39.123
WELL MOVE ON QUICKLY.

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.024
SO THEY HAVE TO GIVE THE

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:42.460
ANSWERED WITH A SPECIFIC REASON

00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:43.995
INSERT CAN CONTESTED.

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:46.831
BUT BASICALLY THEY ARE THAT'S

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:47.799
THAT'S WHERE IT STANDS.

00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:49.267
SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:51.469
INTRODUCTION OF THIS NEW TOOL

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.104
AND WITH THE FIRES WE'VE HAVE.

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:54.405
BEEN HAVING.

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:56.607
GOING TO FLIP -- TO LET'S SEE

00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:59.243
HERE.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:04.949
CONCERNED GETTING A THE REAL

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:08.086
TIME ISSUES WE'RE DEALING WITH.

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:10.154
THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS NOTICE I

00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:11.456
MENTIONED SEEMS UNFAIR TO A LOT

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:12.890
OF PEOPLE.

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:15.526
THE IT IS VERY HARD TO

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:17.328
IMMEDIATELY FIND NEW COVERAGE

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:19.330
TODAY FORTY FIVE DAYS SUFFICE

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:20.598
YEARS AGO.

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.433
TODAY IF THE MARKET.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.237
IS OF LESS AVAILABLE TO FOLKS IT

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:27.839
IS THEY REALLY HAVE TO SHOP

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:30.074
BEYOND THEIR TYPICAL

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.877
CIRCUMFERENCE OF AGENTS OR A AND

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:34.245
THEY NEED TO GO FURTHER AND THAT

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:35.279
TAKES LONGER.

00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:36.614
THERE'S NO STANDARDS SECOND

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:38.583
BULLET FOR WHAT WOULD MAKE ME

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:41.386
MORE INSURABLE WHAT DO I AIM FOR

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:42.587
IF I'M GOING TO MITIGATE MY HOME.

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:44.155
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT I NEED TO DO

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:46.357
THE HOME HEARTENING BESIDES THE

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:48.893
DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.962
AND THEN AS WAS MENTIONED

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:52.497
EARLIER THE ISSUES WITH THE

00:33:52.563 --> 00:33:53.998
COVERAGE LIMITS AVAILABLE IN

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:54.966
BOTH THE CARE.

00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:56.701
GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION AND WITH

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:57.969
FAIR PLAN.

00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:59.971
AN ISSUE IS THIS NEW PARADIGM

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:01.806
THIS NEW CHANGE OF HOW THINGS

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.341
ARE UNDERWRITING AND FIRES

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:04.575
PROGRESS.

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.677
THAT'S COUNTY THAT'S CATCHING A

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:09.180
LOT OF CITIZENS WHO MOVED TO AN

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:10.448
AREA BECAUSE IT WAS LESS

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:12.016
EXPENSIVE.

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:13.618
MEETS THE INCOME THEY HAD MAYBE

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.186
THAT'S THE REPORT THEY'VE MOVED

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:16.487
TO RETIRE.

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:17.555
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:19.957
INSURANCE HAS CHANGED THE WORLD

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.726
HAS CHANGED ON THEM THEY HAVE A

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.094
FIXED INCOME.

00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:25.062
THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:26.831
THIS NEW PARADIGM OF HOW

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.800
INSURANCES UNDER RIGHT IS UNDER

00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:31.102
WRITTEN AND READ IT.

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:32.203
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.805
OCCURRING NEXT SLIDE IS FAIR

00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:35.740
PLAN GROWTH.

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:37.508
I PUT GROWTH IN QUOTES BECAUSE

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.076
THE FAIR PLAN OVERALL HAS NOT

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:40.912
GROWN.

00:34:40.978 --> 00:34:42.647
IT IS ACTUALLY GOING DOWN IN

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:45.349
NUMBERS BUT ITIS GROWING IN

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:48.486
THOSE WILDFIRE -- URBAN

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.121
INTERFACE AREAS.

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:54.459
SO WHILE IT'S GONE DOWN.

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:55.092
FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THOUSAND OVERALL

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:56.461
IN THE URBAN AREA IT HAS

00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:59.163
INCREASED BY ELEVEN THOUSAND

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.231
FIVE HUNDRED HOMES AS OF THE END

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:01.132
OF LAST YEAR.

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.301
IN THE WE WE HAS -- IS

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:04.735
REFERENCED.

00:35:04.802 --> 00:35:07.205
AND THAT'S FOR PEOPLE PRESUMABLY

00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:09.106
THAT CAN'T FIND COVERAGE.

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:10.908
WESLEY LOOKED AT RENEW THEIR

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.743
POLICY.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.145
ALSO AGO QUICKLY HERE THE

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:15.680
INSURANCE RATES.

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:17.615
NOTE US SENATOR MORE LIKE YOU

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:18.483
HAD A QUESTION HERE.

00:35:18.549 --> 00:35:20.017
THE WAY RATES ARE SET IN

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.619
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A PRIOR

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:23.120
APPROVAL PROCESS.

00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:25.223
INSURERS THAT WANT TO CHANGE THE

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:27.391
RATES UP OR DOWN MUST APPLY TO

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.126
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND

00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.628
STABILITY SUBMIT A RATE

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:33.164
APPLICATION THAT DETAILS.

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:35.833
WHY THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE A

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.235
NEED FOR THAT ST STE?

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:41.138
SO THE BASIS FOR MAKING THAT

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:42.640
DECISION IS.

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:44.008
PRINCIPALLY THEIR LOSS

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:47.178
EXPERIENCE FROM THE RECENT PAST

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:48.646
SO FOR A LARGE COMPANY LIKE

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:51.716
STATE FARM THE PRINCIPLE OF

00:35:51.782 --> 00:35:54.185
MOTIVATION FOR THE INCREASE.

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:55.987
IS GOING TO BE BASED ON THEIR

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:58.389
LOSS EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST

00:35:58.456 --> 00:35:59.423
YEAR.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.825
STATE FARM IS SO LARGE AS TO

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:03.261
HAVE ONE YEAR OF EXPERIENCE

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.663
GIVES THEM ENOUGH CREDIBILITY

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:05.930
FOR RATE.

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:06.898
SO.

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:08.332
YOU TAKE THAT LAST YEAR'S

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.734
EXPERIENCE.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.869
AND YOU YOU PROJECT WHETHER YOU

00:36:11.936 --> 00:36:13.504
THINK NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BE

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.772
LIKE LAST YEAR.

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:17.808
OR LESS LIKE IT MORE YOU KNOW

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:19.443
MORE LOS LESS LOSS IT'S A

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.078
PROJECTION THAT IS MADE BY THE

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:23.814
ACTUARY LOOKING AT THE TREND

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:24.115
[inaudible]

00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:25.917
SO.

00:36:25.983 --> 00:36:28.152
THE LOSS RESULTS SO WHEN WHEN

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:29.987
THE RATE IS APPROVED.

00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:31.222
WHATEVER IS APPROVED IF IT'S AN

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:32.890
INCREASE.

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:35.560
IT IS DISTRIBUTED OVER A SET OF

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:36.861
FACTORS.

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:39.130
SO IT'S NOT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY

00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:40.131
SO.

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:41.732
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER SLIDE THAT I

00:36:41.799 --> 00:36:43.768
THINK SHOWS THIS.

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:45.469
IT'S NOT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY IT

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:47.371
GOES OUT TO THE HIGHER RISK

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:49.640
AREAS WILL ABSORB MORE OF THAT

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.276
RATE INCREASE.

00:36:52.343 --> 00:36:54.078
THE OTHER PIECE THAT I MAY BE

00:36:54.145 --> 00:36:55.846
THE INDUSTRY WILL TALK ABOUT THE

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.348
THE PAPER TALKS ABOUT.

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.750
BACKGROUND PAPER IS ABOUT HOW WE

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.285
DO CATASTROPHE LOSSES.

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:04.655
AND IN CALIFORNIA WE USE WE TAKE

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:06.991
CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THE

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.159
CAMPFIRE.

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:09.660
WE REMOVE THEM FROM THE

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:12.096
INSTRUCTORS LOS EXPERIENCE.

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:15.466
SO ALL OF THAT 2100% LOSS RATIO

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:20.104
OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OR THE

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:23.007
AND 70% OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.875
THAT DOESN'T GET LOADED DIRECTLY

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:25.943
INTO THE RACE.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.346
THE CATASTROPHE LOSSES ARE TAKEN

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:31.148
OUT OF THEIR THEIR AVERAGED.

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.084
OVER A TWENTY PLUS YEAR.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.286
TIME FRAME AND THEN AND THEN ADD

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:36.854
IT BACK IN AS A FACTOR.

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.023
SO YOU MULTIPLY THE NON

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.058
CATASTROPHIC RATES BY A

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:42.860
CATASTROPHE FACTOR IT'S

00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.428
COMPLICATED.

00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:47.264
BUT IT IS A WAY OF ACCOUNTING.

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:49.533
FOR CATASTROPHE EVERY YEAR IN

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.669
THE INSURERS RATES WHETHER THERE

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:53.671
IS A CATASTROPHE OR NOT THERE IS

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:55.172
A CATASTROPHE LOADING.

00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:56.707
THAT REFLECTS THEIR AVERAGE

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:59.143
CATASTROPHE PAYMENTS CAN I ASK

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.211
YOU TO WRAP UP YOUR COMMENTS

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:03.147
PLEASE THANK AND WRAPPED THEM UP.

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:06.517
THIRDLY.

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:10.221
I THINK ALL JUST THE I'LL JUST

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:12.423
TURN TO SLIDE NINETEEN WHICH IS

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:18.295
A FIRE LINE WHILE FIERY FACTORS.

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:21.465
IN THAT THIS IS FROM A RATE

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:22.967
FILING FROM A GIVEN AND SIR --

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:25.136
AND IT IS AN INTERESTING IT

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:28.739
TELLS A BIG STORY JUST IN THAT

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.207
IT SHOWS ITS CURRENT.

00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:33.144
FIRE LINE RATE FACTORS SO HOW

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.012
MUCH DID CHARGES AN INSURED

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:37.615
BASED ON THE SCORE FROM THEIR

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:39.650
WILDFIRE RISK MODEL.

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:40.985
NOW THE SCORE OF WHICH THIS

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:45.489
PARTICULAR MODEL USES A SCORE OF

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:46.057
ZERO TO THIRTY ZERO BEING NO

00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:48.292
WILD FIRE RISK. THIRTY EXTREME

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:50.428
WILD FIRE RISK AND YOU CAN SEE

00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:52.530
THE SURCHARGE AND THAT CURRENT

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:54.298
FILE FIRE LINE SCORE HOW IT

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:58.869
INCREASES BASED ON THE SCORE.

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.072
AND WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING. TO

00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:02.506
INCREASE THAT.

00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:04.975
PRETTY DRAMATICALLY IN THE FINAL

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:06.277
PROPOSED FACTOR.

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:09.113
SO IF YOU LOOK DOWN AT A SCORE.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.848
THIRTY THEY CURRENTLY CHARGE

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:13.484
THAT PERSON DOUBLE THE PREMIUM

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:15.019
THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE FOR A

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:17.955
PERSON IN AN URBAN AREA.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.657
WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO CHARGE

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.992
THAT PERSON IS THREE TIMES THE

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.360
AMOUNT THEY WOULD CHARGE IN AN

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.596
URBAN AREA?

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:28.265
IF YOU LOOK OVER TO THE LEFT

00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:30.034
EARNED EXPOSURES.

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.570
YOU SEE THAT THE ONLY RIGHT ONE

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:35.740
RISK IN THAT A SCORE OF THIRTY

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:37.508
AND IN FACT AS YOU LOOK UP THAT

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:40.344
TABLE FROM THAT.

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:43.080
ONE THEY WRITE VERY FEW RISKS.

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:45.750
ANY ANYWHERE ABOVE.

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.418
A NINE REALLY SO IT'S A VERY

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:49.120
SMALL NUMBER.

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:51.188
SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN AN INSURER

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:52.757
TAKES A RATE INCREASE AND I

00:39:52.823 --> 00:39:53.724
THINK THERE'S A MENTION OF

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.926
COMMONLY A SIX POINT 9%.

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.728
INCREASE.

00:39:57.795 --> 00:40:00.998
THAT INCREASE IS DISTRIBUTED --

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:03.033
SO THAT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.902
THAT RATE INCREASE HAPPENS TO

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.570
THE PEOPLE AT THESE THIS LEVEL

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:09.573
OF SCORE.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.676
AND IF IT AT AND THE END STAYS

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:15.212
NEUTRAL FOR THE PERSON DOWN AT

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.914
THAT LOW RISK AREA.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:17.548
AND SO.

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.450
BETWEEN NON RENEWALS AND RATE

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:21.919
INCREASES THIS IS THE REALITY

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:23.487
FOR CONSUMERS THROUGHOUT THE

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:24.555
STATE.

00:40:24.622 --> 00:40:26.690
WHICH IN THEIR AREAS AT A THIRTY

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.392
IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTY IN TE

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:31.962
STATE -- THAT THAT THEY'RE

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.931
FACING FOR THEIR INSURANCE.

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:34.565
THANK YOU FOR THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:35.766
HAVE TO A MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:37.201
PANELIST BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:39.003
AND I WILL GIVE ARE A MEMBERS AN

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:40.271
OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS AT

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:42.139
THE END JUST SO WE MAKE SURE

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:43.707
THAT WE'RE RESPECTFUL OF ALL THE

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:44.909
VISITORS HERE AND THE PANELISTS.

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.143
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT WE'RE

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.379
GONNA MOVE ON TO MISS RACKS

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.180
THANK YOU.

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:50.047
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.582
YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:52.917
TESTIFY TODAY.

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.285
ABOUT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:55.686
REGULATION AND AFFORDABILITY

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:57.555
ISSUES.

00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.190
BUT ISSUES WITH HOMEOWNERS

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:01.058
INSURANCE AVAILABILITY WHICH THE

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:02.526
NEXT PANEL WILL DISCUSS IN

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:04.161
GREATER DEPTH.

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:05.796
HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN SEVERAL PAST

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.431
REGULATORY DECISIONS AND IT'S

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:08.732
IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THESE

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:09.934
POLICY CHOICES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.402
MADE.

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.736
AN ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR DIRECT

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.772
CONSEQUENCES.

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.240
AND INSURERS ABILITY TO SERVE

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.741
COMMUNITIES THREATENED BY WILD

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:18.676
FIRE.

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.110
IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO ITS

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.579
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:22.880
OF INSURANCE.

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.316
WHICH HAS A DUAL ROLE.

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:26.784
ON THE ONE HAND THE DEPARTMENT

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:28.219
IS EMPOWERED TO PREVENT

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.687
EXCESSIVE RATES.

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:31.355
AND CAN EVEN ORDER INSURERS TO

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:33.624
REDUCE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED RATES

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:34.925
THAT IT BELIEVES HAVE BECOME

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:37.161
EXCESSIVE OVERTIME.

00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:37.895
ON THE OTHER HAND.

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:39.697
THE DEPARTMENT.

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:42.399
MUST MONITOR SOLVENCY TO ENSURE

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:44.268
THAT INSURERS CAN PAY CLAIMS.

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.036
IN THIS BALANCING ACT IF THE

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.238
DEPARTMENT RESTRAINTS AND

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.940
INSURERS RATES TO AGGRESSIVELY.

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:51.542
THE PLACES FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:52.810
THAT INSURER.

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.612
WHICH WILL THEN REDUCE EXPOSURE

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.547
TO HIGHER RISK AREAS.

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.147
WHERE THEY CANNOT GET ADEQUATE

00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:59.483
RATE?

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.951
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS.

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.786
THE DEPARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.321
APPROACHED RATE REGULATION IN A

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:05.789
MANNER THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.958
THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:08.859
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:09.894
ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.529
COMMISSIONERS AS OF TWENTY

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:13.330
SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD THE

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:14.965
THIRTY SECOND HIGHEST AVERAGE

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.267
HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE PREMIUM IN

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:17.668
THE COUNTRY.

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.503
AND WHEN THAT IS ADJUSTED FOR

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.838
AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IT

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:22.273
DROPPED TO FORTY THIRD IN THE

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:24.108
COUNTRY.

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:25.643
THIS LOWER PREMIUM LEVEL WAS A

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:27.978
STARK CHANGE FROM SEVERAL YEARS

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:29.780
EARLIER WHEN IN TWO THOUSAND

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:30.848
NINE CALIFORNIA HAD THE

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:31.382
FOURTEENTH HIGHEST AVERAGE

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:33.050
PREMIUM.

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.019
SO DURING THAT PERIOD.

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:36.320
THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNERS PREMIUM

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:39.423
IN THE NATION INCREASED BY 45%.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:40.925
WHILE IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:44.628
INCREASED BY ONLY EIGHT POINT 1%.

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:46.463
SO HURRICANE STATES HURRICANE

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.198
EXPOS STATES SUCH AS LOUISIANA

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:49.900
AND FLORIDA NOW HAVE AVERAGE

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.535
PREMIUMS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT OF

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:54.171
CALIFORNIA.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.906
SO WITH RESTRAINED RATES

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:56.974
THERE'S GENERALLY A MARKET

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:59.677
RESPONSE RELATED TO AVAILABILITY.

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:01.645
EVEN BEFORE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:02.646
FIRE SEASON.

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:04.048
THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:06.283
WAS ALREADY REACTING.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.918
ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S FOURTH

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.320
CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT.

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:10.988
THE STATE WIDE NUMBER OF SURPLUS

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:13.123
LINE AND FAIR PLAN POLICIES IN

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.124
HIGH RISK AREAS HAD ALREADY

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:16.961
STARTED TO INCREASE BY.

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:17.594
TWENTY FOURTEEN WELL BEFORE THE

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.629
FIRES.

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:19.797
AND WHILE THE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS

00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:21.532
WERE SMALL.

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:23.267
THE TREND WAS REAL.

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:25.002
AND IT WAS FORESEEABLE.

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:26.470
AND COULD ACCELERATE FOLLOWING

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:28.172
THE MASSIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:30.107
TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRES.

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.542
WHILE THE ADMITTED MARKET

00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:32.977
CARRIERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED

INCREASE APPROVED -- THAT EXCEED

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:52.301
7% SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN.

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.437
WELL FIRST AN ANSWER -- ANY

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.105
ANSWER CAN OF CAN FILE FOR

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.007
GREATER THAN 7%.

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:00.543
THEY JUST TAKE -- THE THERE IS

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.945
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A CONSUMER

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:04.981
ADVOCACY GROUPS SUCH AS CONSUMER

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:08.284
WATCHDOG. TO CHALLENGE THAT RATE

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:11.187
INCREASE AND IF A HEARING IS

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.689
REQUESTED IT DOES HAVE TO GO TO

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:14.123
HEARING.

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.459
IF IT IS GREATER THAN A 7%

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:19.195
INCREASE SO ANY ANY COMPANY CAN

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:20.129
FILE FOR THAT.

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:22.231
THE FAIR PLAN IS NOT.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:24.634
A PROP ONE OF THREE SUBJECT

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.235
ENTITY THEY'RE NOT.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.637
AN ANSWER -- AND AND UNDER THAT

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:30.640
DEFINITION SO THEY FILE.

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.241
FOR WHATEVER THEY THINK THEY

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:33.576
NEED.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.744
AND THE THE POINT OF THAT OF

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.913
COURSE IS. TO SHOW THAT EVEN

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:39.982
THOUGH THEY TOOK A 20% INCREASE.

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.784
THERE WERE CONSUMERS AND URBAN

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.419
BOOK OF BUSINESS WHICH IS.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:44.387
THE MAJORITY OF THEIR BUSINESS

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:47.089
GOT A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.491
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT RAPE IS

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:49.926
DISTRIBUTED.

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:52.028
IN PEOPLE IN THAT MOVIE THEY GOT

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.530
SIGNIFY RATE INCREASES SO IT'S

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.432
7% IN THE AGGREGATE.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.167
YEAH THAT'S IN THE AGGREGATE OR

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.169
NOT KIDS 20% IN THE CRICKET

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:04.373
THANKS MISTER FRAZIER YOU'VE

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.944
BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING BRIGHT.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.278
DON'T LISTEN TO EMERGE.

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.881
I DIDN'T HEAR HANDSOME BUT I

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.449
COULD THROW THAT IN -- YOU FOR A

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.283
YOU USED A LOT OF INTERESTING

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.818
TERMS IN YOUR PRESENTATION --

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.386
RESTRAINED RATES [inaudible]

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:18.588
GREAT INADEQUACY.

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:20.523
CLIMATE RATE INCREASES --

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.225
PROVIDED IN OTHER STATES.

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:25.628
CLIMATE CHANGE PRICING AND YOU

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.263
CAN ONLY RAISE RATES BASED ON

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.397
TWENTY YEAR TREND SINCE RIGHT

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:29.632
NOW WE HAVE A TWO YEAR TREND

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.402
IT'S AWFUL RATE -- SO I I'M BUT

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:34.270
BUT THE THING YOU DID DID YOU

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:35.338
SAID IT'S AN ARMATURE THAT KIND

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.906
OF POPS OUT TO ME THE MOST AND I

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:37.840
LIKE YOU.

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:38.975
TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE AS WE

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.943
DOES NOT ALLOW FOR RE INSURANCE

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.778
AND AND COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT A

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:45.248
LITTLE BIT MORE WHY.

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:46.682
IS THAT THE CASE.

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.484
WHAT'S A POLICY CHOICE BY THE

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.920
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN.

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:52.788
WHAT I HOPE TO CONVEY IN MY

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:55.124
COMMENTS IS?

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:56.592
BLEACHER INTO HISTORY POSITION

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:58.160
ISN'T THAT PROP ON A THREE IS

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.396
GOOD OR BAD IT'S OBVIOUSLY AND

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.197
HOW.

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:03.099
THE REGULATOR CHOOSES TO

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:04.967
IMPLEMENT PROP ONE OF THREE AND

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.535
THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:09.772
THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT PROP

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.073
ONE OH THREE AND IT'S JUST A

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.775
COMPLICATED BUNDLE OF CHOICES.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:15.077
AND SO IN THE THREE ASPECTS OF

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.212
THE BUSINESS YOU'VE GOT

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:17.480
UNDERWRITING RATING AND CLAIMS

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:17.780
[inaudible]

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:20.750
AND DID YOU HEAR MOST OF THE

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:23.486
POLICY PROPOSALS ARE LET'S MAKE

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:25.688
CLAIMS BE PAID MORE.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.823
LET'S RESTRICT UNDERWRITING SO

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.026
THAT WE HAVE IT'S HARDER TO NON

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.093
RENEW AND YOU JUST HAVE TO SORT

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.529
OF TAKE EVERYBODY WITH NO REAL

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.097
CONNECTION TO THE THIRD ELEMENT

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:37.066
WHICH IS RIGHT.

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.734
RIGHT IT'S EASY TO SAY TAKE

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:41.037
EVERYBODY PAY HIGHER CLAIMS AND

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.371
THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.206
NOT LET THEM CHARGE ENOUGH.

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.074
AND NOT SUSTAINABLE TO LET'S NOT

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:46.575
RIGHT.

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.044
AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.378
INSURANCE HAS CHOSEN IT'S NOT

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.580
REQUIRED BY PROPOSITION ONE OF

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:52.581
THREE BUT DEPARTMENT OF

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:54.917
INSURANCE HAS CHOSEN. TO

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:56.686
APPROACH THE RATE MAKING AS A

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:58.421
FREE INSURANCE IS NOT A PART OF

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.156
DECISION MAKING FOR INSURANCE

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:01.157
COMPANIES.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.925
AND INSURANCE COMPANIES IN

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.628
REALITY DO USE REINSURANCE IN

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:06.996
THE USE IT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:08.531
PURPOSES THAT USE IT SO THEY CAN

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.099
PRODUCE NEW BUSINESS THEY DON'T

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.267
HAVE TO TELL THEIR AGENTS.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:12.935
OPERATIC CAPITAL WE CAN'T

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:13.536
PRODUCE ANY MORE BUSINESS SO

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:15.638
SORRY -- YOU CAN'T WRITE ANYMORE

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.073
YOU CAN'T ERNIE INNER EARNING

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.274
MORE COMMISSION RIGHT SO WE

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:20.876
INSURANCE ISN'T ACCEPTED REGULAR

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:21.577
PART.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.146
OF THE INSURANCE MARKET NOW THE

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:25.181
POLICY CONCERN OF THE

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:26.882
DEPARTMENT'S UNDERSTANDABLE

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.217
WHICH IS PROP ONE OF THE THREE

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.653
SUBJECTS INSURANCE COMPANY RATES

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.621
TO PRIOR APPROVAL BUT IT DOESN'T

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.223
SUBJECT RE INSURANCE.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.192
RATES TO PRIOR APPROVAL SO THE

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:37.827
FEAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN WELL IF WE

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.562
ALLOW THE UNDERLYING COST

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.497
INCREASES OF REINSURANCE TO BE

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:42.865
PASSED ALONG.

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.367
THEN THAT'S SORT OF A WAY TO GET

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:45.868
AROUND THE PROP ON A THREE RATE

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.803
CONTROLS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:50.239
THEORETICAL CONCEPT BUT THERE'S

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:51.807
A PRICE TO BE PAID.

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.142
BECAUSE AS THE WORLD US DOWN

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:54.810
LOOKING A CALIFORNIA AND WHAT

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:55.444
WHAT ARE THE MESSAGES THAT THEY

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.645
GET.

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:58.013
THE NEW NORMAL WHEN THEY SEE

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.248
THESE GIGANTIC LOSSES AND

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:01.050
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING GIGANTIC

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.518
LOSSES AROUND THE WORLD.

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:03.552
DO YOU THINK THE REINSURANCE

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:04.754
WORLD OF SAYING HEY I GOT A HUGE

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.322
APPETITE FOR CALIFORNIA AND I

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:09.358
REALLY REALLY WANT. TO GIVE

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:10.493
GREAT DEALS TO THESE INSURANCE

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.927
COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS THERE

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.429
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:15.598
THEY ARE -- INCREASING THEIR

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:17.333
PRICES INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.067
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.535
THAT SEVEN INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:21.237
REINSURANCE COSTS GO UP 30%

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.772
GUESS WHAT.

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:24.774
THEY HAVE NO WAY TO FUND THAT

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.276
EXCEPT JUST OUT OF PROFITABILITY.

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:29.011
AND SO THEY THEN HAVE TO FIGURE

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:30.246
OUT WELL.

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:31.480
IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RATE

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.282
COMING IN.

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.984
THEN WHAT DO WE DO WE CAN'T PAY

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.719
LOWER WE CAN'T BE HARDER ON

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.320
CLAIMS THAT'S NOT A RIGHT WAY TO

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:39.755
DO IT RIGHT SO THERE'S ONLY ONE

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:40.556
OTHER PART OF THE BUSINESS AND

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.558
THAT'S UNDERWRITING.

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:43.993
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:45.461
PRICE YOU HAVE TO START FIGURING

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:47.062
OUT HOW DO I. D. LEVERAGE MY

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:48.397
BOOK IN A WAY TO REDUCE THE

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:49.398
AVERAGE RISK IN THE BOOK OF

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:51.066
BUSINESS.

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:51.901
AND THAT'S A STERILE WAY OF

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:53.002
SAYING HOW DO I SAY NO TO MORE

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:55.504
PEOPLE.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:56.105
WE HAVE TO READ NON RENEW MORE

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.206
PEOPLE.

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:58.441
WE HAVE TO NOT WRITE AS MUCH NEW

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.009
BUSINESS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:01.877
AREAS WHERE YOU CAN'T GET STATE

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:03.078
APPROVAL. TO CHARGE AN ADEQUATE

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:04.280
RATE.

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:06.048
AND SO IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE A

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:08.150
GENERAL COMPLAINT ABOUT.

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:09.385
THE DEPARTMENT AND CONSUMER

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:10.853
WATCHDOG APPROACH ON RATES IT'S

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.489
FINE IF THEY WANT TO TO TAKE THE

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:15.057
POSITION THEY'VE TAKEN IN COURT.

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.358
WHICH HAS BEEN.

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:18.060
THEY WANT CALIFORNIA INSURANCE

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:21.864
RATES FOR THE ADMITTED MARKET.

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:23.732
CONFESS KATORI RATE UNDER THE

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:24.200
TAKINGS CLAUSE OF THE

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:25.167
CONSTITUTION.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.969
THEIR POLICY POSITION IS THEY

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.270
WANT RATES TO BE AS LOW AS

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.573
POSSIBLY THEY CAN BE WITHOUT IT

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:30.940
BEING A TAKING.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.174
OKAY.

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:33.375
THAT'S FINE THAT'S THEIR LEGAL

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:33.843
POSITION BUT THERE'S A

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:35.177
CONSEQUENCE TO THAT AND THAT'S

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:36.846
THE FRUSTRATING PART IS THAT

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.113
THEY DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.215
CONSEQUENCE.

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.450
OF THE PREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:42.952
OF THEIR POLICY CHOICE THE

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:44.453
POLICY CHOICES TO PUSH RATES

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.154
DOWN.

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.655
BUT THEN THEY SAY WELL THAT'S

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:48.224
NOT RIGHT OH BY THE WAY PAY MORE

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.825
IN CLAIMS WITH NO QUESTIONS

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:52.695
ASKED OR FEWER QUESTIONS AND BY

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:53.295
THE WAY YOU HAVE TO SAY YES TO

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:54.163
EVERYBODY

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:59.802
OKAY SO AT SOME POINT.

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:00.436
WHEN YOU YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:06.675
TALKING?

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:08.611
JOE HOW OFTEN PUBLIC.

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.079
AND SO IT'S JUST A POLICY CHOICE.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:10.679
AND COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:13.983
FIGURE OUT HOW CAN THEY ACHIEVE.

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:18.821
THE ABILITY TO OPERATE -- THE

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:20.656
END IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:22.124
RESULTS ARE IN THE FIRST

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:23.459
EIGHTEEN YEARS OF THE CENTURY ON

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:24.493
A DIRECT BASIS.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.562
PURSES ON A NET BASIS WHERE WE

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:27.062
ACTUALLY GET TO LOOK AT

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.597
REINSURANCE.

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:29.365
WELL THEY'RE QUITE A DIFFERENT

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:31.166
PICTURE.

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:33.435
OKAY THE DEPARTMENTS A

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.737
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP ON A

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.071
THREE WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE IN

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:36.705
THE FIRST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF THE

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:37.773
CENTURY.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.874
THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.776
MADE MONEY.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.444
ON OTHER CA AND THEIR COMBINED

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.345
RATIO BECAUSE THEIR COMBINED

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.680
RATIO OVER THE FIRST EIGHTEEN

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.682
YEARS IS ABOUT.

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.083
NINETY NINE POINT 6%.

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:49.518
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT ACTUALLY

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:50.619
THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS THEY

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:52.154
PAID VERSUS THE REINSURANCE

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.889
RECEIVABLES THAT THEY RECEIVED

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:54.757
IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.625
STORY WITH A LOSS IN THE FIRST

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.027
EIGHTEEN YEARS OF ABOUT TWENTY

01:09:58.093 --> 01:09:59.962
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.599
SO IT IS -- THE OTHERS JUST AT A

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.467
DISCONNECT THAT WE THINK.

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.468
WE OUGHT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.903
ABOUT BUT THEN MISTER WALKER HOW

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:11.240
COME THE INSURANCE -- FOR

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:14.143
EARTHQUAKES ALLOWS FOR CHARGING.

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.210
FOR REINSURANCE AND WE HAD THAT

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.645
DISCUSSION [inaudible]

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:18.681
JUST RECENTLY.

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:21.650
YES SO OBVIOUSLY.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:22.885
INSURERS DON'T WRITE BUSINESS IN

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.753
CALIFORNIA JUST BECAUSE IT LOOKS

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.855
GOOD ON THE RESUME THEY ARE HERE

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:29.191
TO MAKE MONEY AND I'M SURPRISED

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:31.193
TO HEAR THEY'VE NEVER MADE MONEY.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.494
BUT THIS IS JUST OUT OF THEIR

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.330
GENEROSITY -- MAYBE THEY WOULD

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.965
BE HERE I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:39.668
TRUE -- EARTHQUAKE A FOUR

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.971
EARTHQUAKE IN MED NOW THERE IS A

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:43.539
REINSURANCE COMPONENT.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.774
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE VERY

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.676
SPECIALIZED COVERAGES SO WE'RE

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:48.944
NOT TALKING ABOUT.

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:51.914
AUTO OR HOME OR COMMERCIAL TYPE

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:53.916
PERIL.

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:54.883
SLICE COVERAGE WITH QUICK ALMOST

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:58.153
NEVER HAS A LOSS UNTIL IT DOES

01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.822
RIGHT AND THEN IT IS A BIG.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:01.323
ONE AND SO -- THERE ARE OTHER

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:04.360
FACTORS THAT PLAY INTO THAT.

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.528
ABILITY TO CHARGE A PREMIUM FOR

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:07.997
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE THERE'D

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:10.566
LEVERAGE FACTOR ARE THE PROFIT

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:13.102
MAKING ABILITY IS DIMINISHED

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:14.303
BECAUSE OF THAT REINSURANCE LOAD

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.572
SO IT ISN'T LIKE A FREE RIDE FOR

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:17.573
EARTHQUAKE.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.441
AND MET MAO ALSO ESPECIALLY

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.710
COVERAGE MOST CLAIMS ACTUALLY

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.879
END UP IN LITIGATION AND A

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.981
SETTLEMENT KNOWS NOT SO MUCH

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.182
STRAIGHT UP CLAIMS.

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:30.352
SO WE DO RECOGNIZE SPECIALITY

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:31.487
COVERAGES.

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:32.621
BUT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW FROM

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:35.491
OUR PERSPECTIVE WE GIVE RATE

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:36.992
BASED ON NEED.

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.461
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:40.696
FOR EXAMPLE OF THE FAIR PLAN

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:42.031
THAT YOU POINTED OUT.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:44.500
THEY ARE GETTING A 20% INCREASE

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.235
WE WOULD LIKE THAT RATE TO BE AS

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.337
LOW AS POSSIBLE BUT THAT'S NOT

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:50.039
HOW WE DON'T.

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:52.474
IMPOSE WHAT WE WISH WE IMPOSE

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:54.376
WHAT THE DATA SUGGESTS THE RATE

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:55.911
SHOULD BE.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.546
AND SO THEY GOT A RATE INCREASE

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.248
PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOVIE.

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:01.016
THAT OTHER EXAMPLE I GAVE OF THE

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.518
FIRE LINE SCORES.

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:05.120
THAT COMPANY ALREADY HAS A

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:07.222
SIGNIFICANT SURCHARGE FOR PEOPLE

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:09.324
IN THE WILD FIRE AREA SO WE DO

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:11.593
ALLOW RATE FOR THOSE AREAS THEY

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.861
DO CHARGE MORE.

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:14.963
AND I'LL SAY OUR PROCESS OF

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.900
USING THIS CATASTROPHE LOAD.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.268
THESE LAST COUPLE YEARS ARE

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:20.569
PROBABLY CAUSING THAT

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.471
CATASTROPHE LOW TO INCREASE BY

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:25.007
ABOUT MAYBE 40%.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:27.242
THOSE LOSSES ARE GOING TO BE

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:30.279
LOADED INTO INSURERS RATES FOR

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:33.182
THE NEXT DECADE OR MORE.

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:34.883
UNLESS THE RESERVES SUBROGATION

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.186
RECOVERY TO HELP PULL THOSE

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:38.520
LOSSES BACK OUT.

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:40.522
SO WE DO ALLOW FOR THE RATE THIS

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:43.258
WILL BE A DRAMATIC RATE INCREASE.

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:46.662
DESPITE THE CATASTROPHE LOAD.

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:48.764
ASSESS THAT WE USE FOR CONSUMERS

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:52.468
AROUND THE STATION IMPORTANT.

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:53.535
I THINK JILL FOCUS ON THE FAIR

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:54.336
PLAN IS IS GREAT BECAUSE OF SEEK

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:55.971
KNOWLEDGE THE FAIR PLAN ISN'T

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.673
UNDER THE SAME RULES.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.108
HEY THERE ACTUALLY ENTITLED TO

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:01.043
AN ACTUAL RELEASE ON RATE.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.978
AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.813
ON A THREE THE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.881
CHOSEN DOES NOT.

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:08.517
YIELD UNNATURALLY SOUND RIGHT.

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:11.186
AND SO YOU SEE WHEN YOU HAVE.

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.722
DIFFERENT STANDARDS THE FAIR

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.357
PLAN GETS A 20% INCREASE.

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.559
RIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S AN

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:19.828
EGGNOG AND BY THE WAY I BELIEVE

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.697
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THE

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.232
THE FIRE LINE RELATIVITY'S FOR

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:24.800
FIRE LINE.

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.802
IN THE FAIR PLAN THEY'RE ALLOWED

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.238
TO CHARGE HIGHER -- HIGHER

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:30.606
AMOUNTS AT THE UPPER END OF THE

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.007
RISK RANGE WERE AS IN THE

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.509
ADMITTED MARKET THOSE WOULD BE

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:35.310
SUPPRESSED AND AND SUBSIDIES

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.045
WOULD BE BORNE BY URBAN AND

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:39.481
SUBURBAN CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE THE

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:40.182
IMPACT.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.416
IN IN THE WILL BE SO THERE ARE

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:43.285
JUST DIFFERENT POLICY CHOICES

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:45.587
HERE THAT ARE THERE ARE INVOLVED

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:48.490
AND IT'S IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE --

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.058
A CRITICISM ASMUCH AS IT'S

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.360
GOING TO BE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:52.928
TOLD THAT THERE SHOULD BE

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.530
RESTRICTIONS ON UNDERWRITING.

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.431
WELL LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.100
RATING CHOICES THE DEPARTMENT

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.735
HAS MDE THAT ARE DRIVING THESE

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:01.436
UNDERWRITING RESPONSES AND THAT

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.372
THAT'S WE DON'T SEE THAT

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.240
ACKNOWLEDGMENT HAVING BEEN MADE.

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.375
MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO CLOSE

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.543
WITH ONE LAST QUESTION AND THAT

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:08.777
IS MISTER FRAZIER.

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.479
THEN WHY IS THERE SUCH A HIGH

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:12.247
LEVEL OF COMPETITION IN THE

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.650
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SECOND

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:15.250
HIGHEST ACCORDING [inaudible]

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.419
TO MICHAEL.

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:18.854
WHAT WELL I MEAN I CERTAINLY

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.055
THINK THE REPORT SHOWED THAT

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.056
SINCE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.624
THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.259
REDUCED BY A THIRD?

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:24.760
OKAY.

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.361
YOU KNOW THERE'S A TREND IN THE

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.362
TREND IS GOING.

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.064
WELL THE EXTRACTION IT'S HARD TO

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.432
KNOW I MEAN THERE AGAIN WITH ANY

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:31.934
REGULATORY SYSTEM THERE ARE

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.735
PLUSES AND MINUSES THE THE THE

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:35.304
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP ONE OH

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.805
THREE IT'S PROBLEMATIC IN SOME

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.240
WAYS BUT IT INSULATES COMPANIES

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.375
FROM COMPETITION IN A LOT OF

01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:40.943
WAYS AS WELL RIGHT.

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:42.477
SO -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.713
REASONS FOR COMPANIES TO HAVE

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.681
MARKET SHARE TO STAY.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:46.748
RIGHT SO AGAIN WE'RE NOT HERE TO

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.317
HAVE A BROADSIDE AGAINST PROP

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:49.618
ONE OH THREE ASSISTS THERE ARE

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.186
SOME IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:52.821
THAT HAD CONSEQUENCES AND WE

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:53.388
JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE MEN OF

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:54.623
THAT.

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:55.357
THANK YOU THANK YOU MEASURE

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.059
THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.894
WISHING TO ASK QUESTIONS.

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:00.395
WELL I JUST HAVE ONE ASK

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:02.598
QUESTIONS IF I MAY -- I'VE HEARD

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:03.832
CENTER MORE LIKE NOTE THAT TO

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.000
YOUR TRêN IS NOT ENOUGH.

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.435
TO PREDICT THE FUTURE SO I'M

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:07.135
CURIOUS ABOUT HOW WOULD

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:09.905
PROBABILISTIC MODELING HELP

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.841
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:13.742
IS IT YES.

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:15.677
THANK YOU.

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:19.014
WELL THE THE CONCERN IS THAT THE

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:20.616
THE MESSAGING WE'RE RECEIVING

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:21.884
FREQUENTLY IS THAT WERE IN THE

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:24.119
NEW NORMAL AND THERE'S A WORRY.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:27.189
WILL NINETEEN BE LIKE.

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:27.789
SEVENTEEN EIGHTY AND WHO KNOWS

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.258
RIGHT NOW EVERYONE HOPES IT'S

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:32.461
NOT AND WE HOPE OVER OVER TIME --

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:33.228
AS THE STATE HAS MORE

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:34.329
INVESTMENTS IN FUEL MANAGEMENT

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:36.365
AND AND OTHER ISSUES THAT WE CAN

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:39.201
REDUCE OSSES IN THE AGGREGATE.

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.603
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.405
CONTINUED YEARS OF CATASTROPHIC

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:44.806
LOSSES THAN LOOKING AT THE

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.675
AVERAGE OVER THE LAST TWENTY

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:47.876
YEARS OR THEY'RE SORT OF A

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.711
SMOOTHING OF LOSSES OVER TIME.

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:50.545
IS NOT.

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:54.383
A A A A USEFUL PROTECTION OF IF

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:55.851
THINGS HAVE CHANGED WHERE THE

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:56.985
FUTURE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:58.220
FROM THE PAST.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.855
SO THE POINT IS IF THERE IS A

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:02.491
MODELING METHODOLOGY THAT MORE

01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:04.326
ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE RISK OF

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:08.931
LOSS MOVING FORWARD THAT'S NOT.

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:10.832
REALLY.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:11.466
ANTON USING LAST TWENTY YEARS

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:12.467
THEN WE WOULD LIKE THE CASE TO

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.702
AT LEAST MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:16.238
THIS IS A MORE -- APPROPRIATE

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:18.240
METHOD OF BUILDING A RATE.

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:19.241
AND IF WE CAN'T PROVE IT THEN

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:21.443
THE DEPARTMENT IS FINE TO SAY NO

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.011
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT EVEN

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:24.346
PERMITTED TO MAKE THAT CASE.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.914
THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.484
TALK ON WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:03.452
MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:04.353
FACE.

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:05.520
MY NAME IS MARK SEGMENT NINE

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:10.158
ASSOCIATION.

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:12.661
I RARELY AGREE WITH MR MATIC

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:13.428
ANYTHING MISTER MATTOX SAYS IN

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:14.730
HIS NEW LIFE BUT I DO AGREE THAT

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.631
MISTER FRASIER'S BRILLIANT SO

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:18.700
WE'LL START THERE -- ACCESS TO

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:20.168
INSURANCE IS KEY TO HOMEOWNERS

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:21.503
OF ITS ONE OF THINGS WE NEED TO

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:23.672
PAY ATTENTION TO A YOU CAN'T GET

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:24.272
A MORTGAGE WITHOUT HOMEOWNERS

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:26.041
INSURANCE -- UNFORTUNATELYTHE

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.542
FLIP SIDE OF THAT AS WE FIND OUT

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:28.810
THAT WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE PAY

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:31.146
OFF THEIR MORTGAGE THEY DO THEY

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:32.581
DROP THEIR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE --

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:33.782
WE ACTUALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:34.850
IS AN ASSOCIATION TRIED TO

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:37.219
REMIND PEOPLE -- THAT THEY NEED

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:37.953
TO UPDATE THEIR INSURANCE

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.087
POLICIES AND THEY NEED TO MAKE

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.322
SURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:41.890
INSURANCE POLICIES EVEN IF THEY

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:46.895
PAID OFF THEIR HOUSES -- AS

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:47.462
HIGHLIGHTED BY THE PREVIOUS

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:48.230
PANEL WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.931
TO CONFUSE AVAILABILITY WITH

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:52.334
AFFORDABILITY -- RATE INCREASES

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:53.468
ARE OUT THERE AND PEOPLE ARE

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:56.671
SEEN THEM -- BUT THE IT THE

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.373
DESIRE NOT TO PAY INCREASED

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.941
INSURANCE POLICY IS NOT THE SAME

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:01.843
THING AS NOT HAVING ACCESS TO AN

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.812
INSURANCE POLICY.

01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:04.613
THE PREVIOUS PANEL ALSO TALKED

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:05.947
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS KEY HERE

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:07.783
WHICH IS OF INSURER CAN'T GET

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:10.085
ADEQUATE RATE TO COVER THE REST

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:11.453
THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY FACE --

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.055
THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS THAT YOU

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:14.756
MAKE IT UP IN VOLUME -- THEY

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.491
HAVE TO USE OTHER TOOLS AND ONE

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:17.726
OF THE FEW OTHER TOOLS IS TO USE

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:19.327
UNDER WRITING TO CHOOSE WHERE

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:20.762
THEY WANT TO WRITE AND HOW MANY

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.764
POLICIES THEY WANT TO WRITE IN

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:23.298
VERY SERIOUS.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.300
INJURES ALSO FACE RESTRICTIONS

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.935
PLACED ON THEM BY RE INSURERS --

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:27.936
WE TALK ABOUT THE COSTA

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:29.504
REINSURANCE BUT INJURY RANCHERS

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:31.706
WILL ONLY PROVIDE COMPANIES WITH

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:33.642
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAPACITY --

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.110
BECAUSE THAT'S THE RISK THAT

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.478
THEY WANT TO TAKE SO IF A

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.113
RANCHER IS LIMITED THE COMPANY'S

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.416
CAPACITY THAT WILL ALSO REDUCE

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:42.050
THE AMOUNT OF POLICIES THAT THEY

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:43.318
CAN WRITE.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:44.486
SEVERAL YEARS AGO GOVERNOR BROWN

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.188
STARTED THE TREE MORTALITY TASK

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:48.390
FORCE -- AS PART OF THAT AND AT

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:49.758
THE REQUEST OF MANY WORLD

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.159
ELECTED OFFICIALS THERE WAS AN

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:52.828
INSURANCE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WAS

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:54.629
CREATED -- STATES NUYS SPENT

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:56.198
MANY HOURS OF OUR LIFE THAT WILL

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.666
NEVER GET BACK ON THIS TASK

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:58.533
FORCE.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.401
BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT A

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:00.936
LOOK THAT WAS AVAILABILITY AND

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.238
WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS THAT WHILE

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:04.906
THERE IS A LOT OF ANECDOTAL DATA

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:06.308
ON BOTH SIDES OF IT IT IS VERY

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:08.910
DIFFICULT TO FIND ACTUAL DATA ON

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:11.680
THE AVAILABILITY -- EYES POINT

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:12.981
AS POINTED OUT THAT STEP

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.249
BRIEFING COMPANIES NEED TO BE MY

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:15.584
MIND FOR MANAGING THEIR RESTORE

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:16.551
SURE THE REST ARE NOT OVER THE

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:17.853
CONCENTRATED ONE POTENTIALLY

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.020
RISKY AREA.

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:20.188
I ONCE WORKED FOR A COMPANY THAT

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.090
HAD AN INSURANCE AGENT THAT SOLD

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:22.958
FOUR HUNDRED POLICIES IN A

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.326
MOBILE HOME PARK.

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:25.794
IT WAS GREAT UNTIL THAT MOBILE

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:28.363
HOME PARK BURNED DOWN -- SO

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.764
COMPANIES ARE REEVALUATING THEIR

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:31.266
WRISTS AS THEY AS CONDITIONS

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:32.934
CHANGE AS WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:36.638
WHAT WE NOW ARE REFERRED TO AS

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:37.305
THE NEW NORMAL.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:38.640
IS THAT WERE NEVER CONSIDERED

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:39.241
FIRE WHICH ARE NOW BEING

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:39.741
CONSIDERED FIRE REST THE

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:41.076
QUESTION IS.

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.477
IF COMPANY A DECIDES NOT TO

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.012
RENEW POLICIES IN AN AREA ARE

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:44.946
THERE COMPANIES THAT WILL STEP

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:46.681
IN AND WRITE THE BUSINESS THIS

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.349
IS THE KEY QUESTION WE NEED TO

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.584
DO. ONE OF THINGS WE DISCOVERED

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:50.051
AS WE'RE HAVING THESE

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:51.753
CONVERSATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.088
ON AVAILABILITY.

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:54.389
IS A LOT OF IT IS DETERMINED BY

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.557
HOW IT CONSUMER PERCHES

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.492
INSURANCE EVAN AND CONSUMER HAS

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:59.361
A WHAT IS NOT A CAPTIVE AGENT

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:01.062
AND THAT AGENT ONLY SELLS ONE

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.430
COMPANIES INSURANCE.

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.698
AND THAT COMPANY DECIDES TO

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:05.734
READJUST THEIR BOOK AND MAY NOT

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:06.468
BE WRITING IN THAT PARTICULAR

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:06.968
AREA.

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.336
THAT CONSUMER MAY GET A

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:09.404
PERCEPTION THAT THERE'S NOT

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.939
INSURANCE AVAILABLE THE SAME

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:13.475
THING CAN BE SAID FOR A COMPANY

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.609
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKS WITH

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:15.744
AN AGENT THEM ONLY HAVE A COUPLE

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:16.811
OF AGENTS.

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:18.313
SO WHAT WE TO SWAT WE SET UP IN

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.681
THE TASK FORCE WHICH I THINK

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:20.916
IT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WE MAY

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.484
SEE THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:25.053
IS A SIERRA INSURANCE FINDER.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.488
THIS WAS A CONCEPT THAT THE

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:27.889
MARKET IS INEFFICIENT BECAUSE

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.691
CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE THE

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:31.326
ABILITY TO HAVE GOOD INFORMATION.

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:32.327
A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHOSE

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:33.828
HOUSE LIVES JUST OUTSIDE THE WAS

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:36.298
LEE AREA GOT A 5100% INCREASE ON

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:37.799
HIS INSURANCE POLICY.

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:38.633
BUT HE WEN OUT AND SHOPPING

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.535
FOUND A BETTER POLICY FOR LESS

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.037
RISK BUT HE'S BEEN IN THE CHARTS

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:43.271
INDUSTRY FOR FORTY YEARS SO WE

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:44.306
KNOW THESE THINGS.

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:46.341
MOST CONSUMERS DEL THE CONCEPT

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:47.876
TIMED INSURANCE FINDER WHICH IS

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:50.412
BEING PILOTED AND THE THE C. R.

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:51.346
T. ZERO CHARGE FIGHTER AND IS

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:53.848
ALSO PART OF AB. EIGHTEEN SEVEN

01:20:53.915 --> 01:20:55.250
THE FIVE LEVINE IS THAT

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:56.318
CONSUMERS WHO CAN'T FIND

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:57.252
INSURANCE CAN PUT THEIR

01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:58.420
INFORMATION ON A WEBSITE

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.788
COMPANIES AND AGENTS THAT

01:20:59.854 --> 01:21:00.956
REPRESENT COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.457
STILL WRITING IN THESE

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:03.658
BUSINESSES.

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:04.426
AREAS CAN THEN FIND AND

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:11.099
HOPEFULLY CONNECT AND HOPEFULLY

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:11.700
WE'LL BE ABLE TO KIND OF TAKE

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:14.469
CARE OF THAT -- AS YOU KNOW

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.270
CONSUMERS INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:15.904
ARE REQUIRED PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:16.671
INSURANCE EITHER DIRECTLY OR FOR

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:17.305
THROUGH THE FAIR PLAN THE FAIR

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.340
PLAN IS AS REFERENCE IN YOUR

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:19.841
MATERIAL THROUGH THE INSURER OF

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:20.909
THE LAST RESORT.

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:22.310
ALTHOUGH ORIGINALLY CREATED IN

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:23.845
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AFTER THE

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:24.412
URBAN.

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:26.681
UNREST AND STILL PRIMARILY FOCUS

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:27.782
ON URBAN AREAS THERE IS A

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:29.184
GROWING BOOK OF BUSINESS FOR THE

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:30.318
FAIR PLAN DEALING WITH WHILE

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:32.921
THESE WILDFIRE INTERFACE AREAS.

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:34.589
I IN MANY WAYS THE FAIR PLAN

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.191
AXES A CANARY IN THE COAL MINE

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:37.459
WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT IF THE

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:40.161
FAIR PLAN POLICY COUNTS CO OP WE

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:42.230
MADE THAT MAY SIGNAL MAY SIGNAL

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.932
A PROBLEM IN THE ADMITTED MARKET

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:45.300
THAT WE NEED TAKE A LOOK AT

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.568
HOWEVER WE NEED TO BE.

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:47.902
CAREFUL THAT WE FULLY UNDERSTAND

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:49.237
THE RATES -- THERE WAS

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:51.706
CONVERSATIONS EARLIER ABOUT THE

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:53.308
APRIL RATE INCREASE WELL

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:54.809
IRONICALLY THE FAIR PLAN SAW A

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:57.412
HUGE SURGEON POLICIES IN MARCH

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.147
WAS THAT DUE TO THE IMPENDING

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:00.815
RATE INCREASE THAT AGENTS WERE

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.484
PUSHING WE DON'T KNOW.

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:03.685
ANOTHER THING WE NEED TO TRACK

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.553
IS HOW LONG TO POLICY STAY WITH

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.088
THE FAIR PLAN -- WHAT THE FAIR

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:08.823
PLAN IS FOUND IS AT 12% OF THEIR

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:11.159
POLICIES STAY LESS THAN FOUR

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.027
MONTHS?

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.094
IN WHICH THAT MEANS THAT THESE

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:14.362
PEOPLE ARE THAN FINDING COVERAGE

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:18.233
OUT IN THE MINUTE MARKET WHICH

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.501
IS WHAT WE WANT THEM TO BE.

01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:20.669
ALL WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:21.436
SURPLUS LINES MARKET WITH HER

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.204
LITTLE REFERENCE HERE -- THE

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.839
STAFF ANALYSIS REFERENCES SOME

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:26.875
OF THE MORE EXOTICS A SURPLUS

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:27.942
LINES COMPANIES LIKE LLOYDS OF

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.678
LONDON OF MANY OF OUR NOT THAT

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:30.879
EXOTIC MANY OF MORE -- DID BY

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:33.281
ADMITTED INSURERS -- SUCH AS A I

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.483
G. A NATIONWIDE LIBERTY OTHERS

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:37.218
HAVE THESE COMPANIES THE USE

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.753
THAT BECAUSE THEY ALLOW THE

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.821
FLEXIBILITY TO WRITE IN HIGH

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.823
RISK AREAS WE HAVE SEEN SOME

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:42.724
INCREASE.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:45.160
IN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET WE

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:46.161
DON'T KNOW WOODS IS VERY THICK

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.429
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS.

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:48.496
CLEARLY THE MARKET IT'S HARD IN

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:52.367
AND COMPANIES ARE TAKING A CLOSE

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:52.967
LOOK AT THE REST IN THEIR BOOK

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:53.968
OF BUSINESS.

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:55.170
THERE IS ANOTHER TOOLMENTION IN

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:56.304
THE STAFF BRIEFING THAT CAN HELP

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:57.205
MORE INSURERS RIGHT BUSINESS

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.873
THAT IS A BETTER USE OF MODELING.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.075
BY THIS TIME OF MODEL IN ANY

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:01.810
PREDICTIVE MODELING WE ARE

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:03.211
HEARING A LOT ABOUT HOW THINGS

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.879
HAVE CHANGED IN CALIFORNIA HOW

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.281
WE'RE LIVING IN A NEW NORMAL.

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:07.916
UNFORTUNATE OUR MODELS DO NOT

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.150
ALLOW US TO LOOK FORWARD THEY

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:11.319
ONLY ALLOW US TO LOOK BACKWARDS.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:12.520
AND USE THAT ANALOGY HOW THIS

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:14.422
BECOMES PROBLEMATIC IN A CAR

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:15.724
YOUR WINDSHIELD IS MUCH BIGGER

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:16.791
THAN YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:18.093
BECAUSE YOU DO NEED TO SEE WHERE

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.494
YOU'RE GOING AND THE INSURANCE

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.829
INDUSTRY HAS THAT SAME ISSUE.

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:22.764
WE HOPE THAT BY BETTER USE OF

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:23.832
PREDICTIVE MODELING THAT ALLOW

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:25.533
COMPANIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.735
THE RISKS WHEN INSURANCE CAN

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:30.638
UNDERSTAND THE RISKS THAT THEY

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:31.973
CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR APPETITE.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.274
MY ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS A

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:34.309
BROAD -- CROSS SECTION OF LARGE

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.144
MEDIUM AND SMALL INSURERS IN

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:37.979
MANY CASES SMALL MEDIUM INSURERS

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:39.214
MAY USE THESE DIFFERENT MODEL IN

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.515
AN UNDERWRITING TOOLS AND THEY

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:41.516
HAVE AN APPETITE TO WRITE IN

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:43.017
HIGH RISK AREAS WERE SMALL

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.386
COMPANIES DO NOT.

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:45.019
REMEMBER DURING A PARTICULARLY

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:46.354
HEATED CONVERSATION DURING THE

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:47.288
INSURANCE TASK FORCE MEETING

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:49.157
WHEN A CAPTIVE AGENT WAS TALK

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.458
ABOUT AVAILABILITY PROBLEM GRASS

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:51.526
VALLEY.

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:52.827
I HAVE ONE OF MY MEMBERS ON THE

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:53.895

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:57.532
POLICIES TO OTHER COMPANIES.

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:58.500
SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:00.435
THERE IS A VARIETY OF COMPANIES

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:01.102
THAT MAY BE WILLING TO WRITE IN

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.904
THIS AREA WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:04.372
