REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS

UNDER ATTACK ACROSS THE NATION.

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:27.619
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:28.854
ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON HAS

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.155
WAGED A WAR ON REPRODUCTIVE

HUMAN IN ACCESS TO IT IS A HUMAN

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:41.566

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:42.734

STATUTORILY PROTECTED HERE IN

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:47.072
CALIFORNIA.

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.540
OUR CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.308
CONTINUES TO MAKE STRIDES TO

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:52.277

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.820
INVESTMENT IN REPRODUCTIVE

00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:05.090
HEALTH INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:05.724
NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY PROPOSED

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:06.725
BUDGET THIS YEAR WHICH IS

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:08.260
SITTING ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:10.062
AWAITING HIS SIGNATURE.

00:22:10.128 --> 00:22:11.496
THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALLOCATED

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.499
MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE

IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:20.972
OPPORTUNITY AND AN OBLIGATION TO

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:23.308

STILL ACCESS HEALTH CARE NO

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:28.280
MATTER WHAT.

00:22:28.346 --> 00:22:30.816
IT'S INCREDIBLY DISHEARTENING TO

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:31.349
SEE A MOVEMENT ACROSS THE

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:34.653
COUNTRY TO BAN ABORTIONS.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.755
WE'VE NOW SEEN FIFTEEN STATES

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:38.123
BAN ABORTIONS.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.194
IN THE PAST FIVE MONTHS.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.729
WHICH TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:44.930
AND CABIN ON THE SUPREME COURT

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.598
STATE POLITICIANS ARE EMBOLDENED

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:48.133
TO REGULATE WOMEN'S BODIES AND

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.634
TRY TO FULLY BAND SAFE AND LEGAL

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.103
ABORTIONS.

00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:52.270
BANDS LIKE THIS GO BEYOND

00:22:52.337 --> 00:22:53.305
RHETORIC.

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:54.172
THEY WOULD HAVE DIRE

00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:55.907
CONSEQUENCES TO THE FUTURE WOMEN

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:57.642
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:59.244
THESE BANDS WILL PUT WOMEN'S

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:00.479
LIVES IN JEOPARDY AND THEY'RE

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:01.913
STARTING TO LAND ON GOVERNOR'S

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.549
DESKS AT A RAPID PACE.

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.551
THIS ISN'T A COINCIDENCE.

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:07.652
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO BAN

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.020
ABORTIONS OUT RIGHT.

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:09.888
AND IT'S IN IT.

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:11.757
AND THIS IS NOT JUST AN ATTACK

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:14.392
ON ALABAMA OR MISSOURI WOMEN.

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:15.961
THIS IS AN ATTACK ON ALL WOMEN.

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:17.229
THIS IS AN ATTACK ON OUR BASIC

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.931
HUMAN RIGHT OF BODILY AUTONOMY.

00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:22.434
AND THIS IMPACTS EVERY PERSON

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:24.536
WHO CAN GET PREGNANT.

00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:26.238
POLITICIANS ARE DOING THIS IN

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:27.639
DEFIANCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:30.609
WHO SUPPORT FOR ACCESS TO SAFE

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.611
LEGAL ABORTION IS AT AN ALL TIME

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:34.212
HIGH AND GROWING.

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:35.547
IN FACT RECENT POLLING SHOWS

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:37.783
THAT 73% OF AMERICANS.

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:39.084
SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ROE

00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:40.619
OVERTURNED.

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:42.687
ALREADY ONE IN THREE WOMEN OF

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:43.421
REPRODUCTIVE AGE LIVES IN A

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:44.422
STATE.

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.124
WHERE ABORTION COULD BE OUTLAWED

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:46.992
FOR A WAS OVERTURNED?

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:48.393
THAT'S OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.362
PEOPLE.

00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:51.863
A PATIENT'S HEALTH SHOULD DRIVE

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.598
PERSONAL MEDICAL DECISIONS NOT A

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:55.167
POLITICIANS BELIEFS.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:56.501
THESE ISSUES ARE BETWEEN WOMEN

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:58.904
AND THEIR DOCTORS.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.238
AND WHILE THE NATIONAL ATTACK ON

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:01.540
ABORTION IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.675
MANY MINDS WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:05.477
THAT THIS IS NOT THE ONLY

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.179
PROBLEM THE CALIFORNIA PATIENTS

00:24:07.245 --> 00:24:09.347
AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FACE.

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:11.550
ADEQUATE STAFFING FUNDING

00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:16.354
COMMUNITIES.

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:18.990
A SOARING STI EPIDEMIC.

00:24:19.057 --> 00:24:21.927
IN SAFETY CONSUMER FRAUD AN

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:23.562
UNACCEPTABLE MATERNAL MORTALITY

00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:25.564
RATE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.832
ARE JUST SOME OF THE FEW ISSUES

00:24:26.898 --> 00:24:29.434
AND BARRIERS. TO CARE THE

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:31.269

I ASKED TO CHAIR THE SELECT

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:39.811

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:23.581
THE REALITY IS THAT EVEN IN A

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:25.550
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA.

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:26.150

REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE.

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:02.420
OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF

MILLION LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS.

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:15.386
HOWEVER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MANY

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:17.421
WOMEN CONTINUE TO LACK ACCESS TO

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:19.824
CONTRACEPTION INCLUDING THE FULL

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.559
RANGE OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:22.927
AND MANY ARE NOT USING THE

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.261
METHOD THAT THEY WOULD PREFER TO

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.529
USE.

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:26.664
ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE

DELAY GETTING PREGNANT.

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:41.545
IN ADDITION THERE ARE PERSISTENT

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:43.347
DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO FAMILY

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.121
MY COLLEAGUES AND I CONDUCTED A

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:51.756
STUDY AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:53.491
CALIFORNIA AND WE FOUND THE

00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:55.025
ADOLESCENTS LIVING IN RURAL

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:56.093

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.895
HAD LOWER AWARENESS AND USE A

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:02.233
THOSE IN URBAN AREAS.

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:03.634
WITH THE BEYOND THE PALE PROGRAM

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.970
AT UCSF I'M WORKING O IMPROVE

CONTRACEPTIVE ACCESS FOR ANOTHER

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:09.306
DISADVANTAGED GROUP.

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:11.408
YOUNG ADULTS ATTENDING COMMUNITY

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:13.277

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:14.345
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE A

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:15.479
DISPROPORTIONATE A LARGE

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:19.617
STUDENTS.

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:20.618
RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:22.219
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.587
IGHLY MOTIVATED TO PREVENT

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:25.422
PREGNANCY BUT THEY HAVE LOWER

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:28.192
RATES OF CONTRACEPTIVE USE THAN

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.560
THOSE IN FOUR YEAR COLLEGE.

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:30.728
ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR BETTER

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.163
CONTRACEPTIVE INFORMATION AND

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:34.398
ACCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR HELPING

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:35.332
THE STUDENTS MEET THEIR

CHILDBEARING EDUCATIONAL AND

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.604

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.273
MY RESEARCH AND THAT OF OTHERS

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:44.441
HAS FOUND THAT LACK OF INSURANCE

00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:46.744
AND COST CONTINUED BE A MAJOR

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:49.013
BARRIER TO CONTRACEPTIVE USE.

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:50.714
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LED TO A

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:51.949
SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AND THE

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:54.285
UNINSURED RATE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:56.353
HOWEVER COST REMAINS A COMMON

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.422
REASON FOR NOT USING A METHOD OR

00:40:58.489 --> 00:40:59.957
NOT USING A PREFERRED METHOD.

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:01.725
THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE FOR

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:02.693
METHODS THAT REQUIRE A

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.894
PRESCRIPTION.

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:05.362
MY RESEARCH AMONG YOUNG ADULTS

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.231
IN CALIFORNIA ALSO HIGHLIGHTED

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:09.366
THE WAYS THAT FREQUENT BREAKS OR

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.868
CHANGES IN INSURANCE COVERAGE

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.436
CAN DISRUPT ACCESS TO FAMILY

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:13.170
PLANNING.

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:14.471
WHEN YOUNG ADULTS CHANGE

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.407

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:23.948
IN ADDITION THE YOUNG ADULTS

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:24.849
THAT WE INTERVIEWED LACK TO

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:26.116
BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.688
CONFUSED ABOUT THEIR COVERAGE

00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:32.790
WHICH CAN LEAD TO MISPERCEPTIONS

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:34.458
ABOUT CONTRACEPTIVE COSTS.

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.427
THEY LACK YOU FROM THE RESOURCES

00:41:36.493 --> 00:41:37.494
TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:39.663
BENEFITS AND HOW TO ACTUALLY USE

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.065
THEIR INSURANCE TO GET CARE.

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:42.132
AND I WANT TO SHARE A QUOTE WITH

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:44.068
YOU FROM A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD

00:41:44.134 --> 00:41:45.970
WOMAN THAT WE INTERVIEWED WHO

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:47.404
HAD RECENTLY GAINED EMPLOYER

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:52.243
SHE TOLD US I WAS JUST HOPING

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.644
THAT THE NEW INSURANCE COVER THE

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:56.113
BASICS I WAS SCARED WHEN I WENT

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.114
TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THEY

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.415
TOLD ME MY INSURANCE SHOULD

00:41:58.482 --> 00:41:59.984
COVER MY BIRTH CONTROL.

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.585
I WAS LIKE THANK GOODNESS

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:02.219
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:05.256
TO HAVE TO PAY THAT WAS MY

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.190
CONCERN THE COST.

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:08.259
PUBLICLY FUNDED CLINICS ARE AN

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:09.393
ESSENTIAL SOURCE OF FAMILY

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.462

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.104
RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT ONE IN

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.805
THREE LOW INCOME WOMEN REPORTED

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:23.274
THAT THEY OBTAINED BIRTH CONTROL

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.542
FROM A PUBLICLY FUNDED CLINIC.

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:27.011
FOR MANY WOMEN WHO RECEIVE CARE

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:28.379
AT A PUBLICLY FUNDED FAMILY

MY STUDY A FAMILY PACKED

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.787

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:38.055
IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THESE HEALTH

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.390

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:40.858
UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS LEARN

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:42.426
ABOUT THEIR INSURANCE OPTIONS

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:44.361

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:45.829
PROCESS.

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.898
THE NEW REGULATIONS FOR TITLE

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.199
TEN WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:51.635
PROGRAM AND REDUCE THE NETWORK

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:53.370
OF PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS.

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.306
IF CLINICS CLOTHES OR NEED TO

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:56.774
REDUCE STAFF AND SERVICE HOURS

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.442
THIS WILL LIKELY REDUCE ACCESS

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.244
TO CONTRACEPTIVES AND OTHER

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.812
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES.

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:03.147
ULTIMATELY THIS MAY HAVE THE

00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:04.815
GREATEST IMPACT ON THE LOW

I FEEL INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO WORK

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:41.819
IN A STATE THAT IS CONSIDERED BY

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:43.921
MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:45.022
TO BE A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.323
OASIS.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.559
WHERE PATIENTS HAVE FAR FEWER

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:49.994
FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO CARE? FOR

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.629
BOTH ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:53.697
THAN OTHER STATES.

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:55.933

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.900
THAT A REALITY.

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:57.935
BUT I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT

00:43:58.002 --> 00:43:59.069
TO THINK BEYOND THE QUESTION OF

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:00.437
FINANCIAL COVERAGE REPRODUCTIVE

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:02.106
HEALTH CARE TO THE BROADER

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:03.941
QUESTION OF HOW TO ENSURE THE

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:05.576
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:06.910
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE POLICY.

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.712
MAINTAINS A FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:10.347
REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY AND HUMAN

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:12.483
DIGNITY.

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:13.717
I WANT TO FOR SHARE WITH YOU MY

00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:15.652
DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT RESURGENT

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.054
NARRATIVE THAT JUSTIFIES AND

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:18.555
PROMOTES ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.591
HEALTH CARE BASED ON FIXING THE

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.393
SOCIAL PROBLEM OF POVERTY.

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:24.161
IN OTHER WORDS THE IDEA THAT WE

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.763
CAN ADDRESS ECONOMIC INJUSTICE

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.564
IN OUR SOCIETY BY HAVING MORE

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:29.333
WOMEN USE CONTRACEPTION AND

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.368
THEREFORE HAVE FEWER BABIES.

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:32.403
THIS NARRATIVE HAS BEEN

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:34.138
PROMINENTLY VOICE AS A NARRATIVE

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:35.606
AS A MOTIVATION FOR SEVERAL

00:44:35.672 --> 00:44:37.241
INITIATIVES IN OTHER STATES THAT

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:39.343
ARE PROMOTING CONTRACEPTIVE

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.911
ACCESS IN THOSE GEOGRAPHIES.

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:41.912
ALL THIS NARRATIVE CAN SEEM

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:43.414
INNOCUOUS AT FIRST IT IS

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.182
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT DOES NOT

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.784
PLACE WOMEN'S HEALTH AND ACCESS

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.519
TO HEALTH CARE AS A VALUE.

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:50.154
IN AND OF ITSELF.

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.955
NO OTHER HEALTH SERVICE RANGING

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.524
FROM TREATMENT FOR ASTHMA TO

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.958
CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS TO

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.460
TREATMENT FOR DIABETES.

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.694
NEEDS TO BE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE IT

00:44:57.761 --> 00:45:00.197
SOLVES SOCIETAL PROBLEMS.

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:01.765
WHY IS A SERVICE THAT ONLY WOMEN

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:03.500
NEED ANY DIFFERENT AND WHAT

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:04.935
MESSAGE DOES IT SEND ABOUT THE

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.537
VALUE WE PLACE ON REPRODUCTIVE

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.272
AUTONOMY WHEN IT IS SEEN AS

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:10.074
NECESSARY TO JUSTIFY PROVIDING

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.608
HEALTH CARE?

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:12.276
THAT FACILITATES THIS A TIME TO

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:13.944
ME ON THE BASIS OF SOCIETAL

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:15.279
BENEFIT.

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:17.114
RATHER THAN BENEFIT TO WOMEN

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:19.483
THEMSELVES.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.517
AN ADDITIONAL DAY ADDITIONAL

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:21.685
DANGER OF THESE NARRATIVES IS

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:22.820
THAT BY FRAMING WOMEN'S

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:24.154
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS THE

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:25.722
SOLUTION TO POVERTY.

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:26.690
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION IS BY

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:28.959
DEFAULT ALSO CONSIDERED THE COST

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.527
OF THIS PROBLEM.

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:32.229
AS A RESULT WE CAN BE DISTRACTED

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:33.897
FROM THE REAL NEED FOR ECONOMIC

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:35.699
AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS PROGRAMS THE

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.935
TRULY ADDRESS THE CAUSES OF

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:39.603
ECONOMIC DEPRIVATION.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.605
FURTHER THE IDEA THE BY FIXING

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:42.873
THE PRODUCTION WE CAN FIX THE

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.242
SOCIETY HAS A LONG AND SHAMEFUL

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:46.610
HISTORY.

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:47.244
LOOTING THE HISTORY OF COURSES

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.012
STERILIZATION IN CALIFORNIA THE

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.547
TARGETED WOMEN HIS REPRODUCTION

00:45:50.614 --> 00:45:52.282
WAS SEEN AS UNDESIRABLE.

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:53.617
NAMELY WOMEN OF COLOR AND POOR

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:55.219
WOMEN.

00:45:55.285 --> 00:45:56.220
A NARRATIVE THAT WOMEN'S

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:57.354
REPRODUCTION IS CAUSING THE

00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.256
PROBLEM CAN EASILY SLIP INTO THE

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:00.791
NARRATIVE THAT IT IS CERTAIN

00:46:00.858 --> 00:46:02.626
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION THAT IS

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:03.994
CAUSING THE PROBLEM.

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:05.129
AND LEAD US TO PROBLEMATIC

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:07.297
POLICIES AND PRACTICES SUCH AS

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:08.165
THE COURSE OF STERILIZATION

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:09.433
SCENE IN THE CALIFORNIA PENAL

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.934
SYSTEM IN THE LAST DECADE.

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:12.636
OR LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS TO

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.171
INCENTIVIZE OR REQUIRE WELFARE

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:15.305
RECIPIENTS TO USE SPECIFIC

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:17.407
CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS WHICH WERE

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:19.343
SEEN IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES.

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:20.811
THIS NARRATIVE AROUND WOMEN'S

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:21.678
REPRODUCTION ALSO HAS THE

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:23.380
POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE CLINICAL

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.048
CARE WHERE WE'VE INCREASINGLY

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.017
SEEN PROVIDER PROVIDERS PROMOTE

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:28.385
USE OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:29.786
THAT ARE PROVIDER CONTROLLED

00:46:29.853 --> 00:46:30.787
SPECIFICALLY INTRAUTERINE

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:32.055
DEVICES AND CONTRACEPTIVE

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.323
IMPLANTS.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.592
IN PROBLEMATIC WAYS AND RESIST

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:37.528
REQUEST BY PATIENTS TO HAVE

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:39.196
THESE DEVICES REMOVED.

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:40.531
EVEN MORE CONCERNING WE HAVE

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:42.399
EVIDENCE INCLUDING STUDIES DONE

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:43.967
BY MY TEAM AT UCSF.

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:44.768
THAT THIS PRESSURE TOWARDS

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:46.136
SPECIFIC METHODS IS

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:47.938
DIFFERENTIALLY APPLIED WITH

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.873
WOMEN OF COLOR BEING MORE LIKELY

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.340
TO HAVE THESE METHODS

00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:53.343
RECOMMENDED AND TO BE PRESSURED

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.812
TO LIMIT THEIR FAMILY SIZE.

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:57.414
POLICY MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA CAN

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:58.682
THEREFORE CONTINUE OUR STREETS

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:01.118
STATES TRADITION OF VALUING AND

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:02.686
UPHOLDING REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.254
BY PUSHING BACK AGAINST THIS

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.322
FRAMING OF WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:07.958
AS A MEANS TO A SOCIETAL AND

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:09.493
INSTEAD WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.128
FOCUS ON WOMEN'S RIGHT TO HEALTH

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:11.929
CARE.

00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:13.197
AND THE VALUEOF THEIR

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:16.633
REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.834
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:19.002
REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY IS

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:20.804
THINKING CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW WE

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:23.040
JUDGE THE SUCCESS OF

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:23.607
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:24.474
POLICY.

00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:25.108
THERE IS AN INCREASE MOVEMENT

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:27.411
AWAY FROM THE CONVENTIONAL FOCUS

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:28.679
ON PREVENTING WHAT IS CALLED

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:30.614
UNINTENDED PREGNANCY AS THE SOLE

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.816
GOAL A FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:34.051
AND POLICIES.

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:34.885
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:36.620
CONCEPT OF PREGNANCY PLANNING IS

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:38.622
NOT UNIVERSALLY SALIENT OR

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.324
DESIRABLE FOR ALL WOMEN.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.225
AND THAT JUDGING WHETHER

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.026
PREGNANCY IS CONSIDERED GOOD OR

00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:45.095
SUCCESS BY WHETHER IT IS

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:46.663
INTENDED OR PLANNED CAN THE

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:47.831
COLLECT THE REAL FEELINGS OF

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:48.999
WOMEN ABOUT THEIR OWN

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.267
PREGNANCIES.

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:51.535
IN WHICH A SURPRISE PREGNANCY

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:54.404
MAYBE WELCOME OR EVEN DESIRABLE.

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:55.772
IN OTHER WORDS TREATING THE

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:56.807
CONCEPT OF AN UNINTENDED

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.141
PREGNANCY IS A UNIVERSALLY

00:47:58.208 --> 00:47:59.843
NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOME IN THE

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.312
SAME WAY THAT A STROKE OR INFANT

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:04.081
MORTALITY IS A NEGATIVE OUTCOME.

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:05.382
DOES NOT HONOR THE ASPECT OF

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:06.617
REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY THAT

00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:08.619
ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO FIND FOR

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:10.787
THEMSELVES WHAT IS DESIRABLE

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.856
WITH RESPECT TO REPRODUCTION.

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:13.957
WELL THIS PROSELYTISING

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:15.692
UNINTENDED PREGNANCY AS OUR SOLE

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:17.461
METRIC OF SUCCESS IS DEFINITELY

00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:18.762
CURRENTLY ON THE CUTTING EDGE IN

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:19.796
OUR FIELD.

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:21.198
I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO THINK

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.799
ABOUT HOW THE FOCUS ON PREGNANCY

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:24.768
INTENTION IS REFLECTIVE OF AN

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.403
OVERLY SIMPLISTIC AND

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.205
PRESCRIPTIVE MANNER WE HAVE OF

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:30.707
THINKING ABOUT AN ACTING ON

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:32.242
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY.

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:33.744
MOVING FORWARDS WE ARE WORKING

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:34.811
TOWARDS NEW METRICS THAT MORE

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:36.413
COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS HOW

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.215
WOMEN THEMSELVES FEEL ABOUT THE

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:39.349
REPRODUCTION.

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:40.584
INCLUDING CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:43.487
PREGNANCY ACCEPTABILITY AND

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:45.656
REPRODUCTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE.

00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:46.923
WE ALSO CLEARLY NEED TO PAY MORE

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.225
ATTENTION TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:50.027
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:50.627
FOCUSED ON THE PRIORITIES OF

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:51.995
PATIENTS AS OPPOSED TO CLINICAL

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:54.698
SYSTEMS OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS.

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:55.599
THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.668
CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING THAT

00:48:57.734 --> 00:48:58.835
PRIORITIZES WOMEN'S OWN NEEDS

00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:00.237
AND PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.805
REPRODUCTION AS OPPOSED TO

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:03.173
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS DESIRE TO

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.274
HAVE THEM USE THE METHOD THEY

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:06.877
CONSIDER TO BE THE BEST METHOD.

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.178
IT ALSO INCLUDES ATTENTION TO

00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:10.113
IMPLICIT BIAS AND HOW THAT CAN

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.417
SHOW UP IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.852
TARGETING WOMEN OF COLOR.

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:17.354
FINALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:19.256
ESSENTIAL NATURE OF NOT JUST

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:19.990
THINKING ABOUT ABORTION AND

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:21.058
CONTRACEPTION WHEN THINKING

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.626
ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH POLICY

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:24.928
BUT IN FACT THINKING ACROSS THE

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:26.396
REPRODUCTIVE LIFE COURSE.

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:27.998
AS WOMEN OF COLOR ACTIVISTS MADE

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.466
CLEAR IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:30.701
WHEN THEY FOUNDED THE

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:32.202
REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MOVEMENT.

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:33.904
REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY IS NOT

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.505
HONORED WHEN WE ONLY LOOK AT THE

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:36.506
QUESTIONS OF THE QUESTION OF

00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:38.475
WOMEN'S ABILITY TO CHOOSE NOT TO

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.409
HAVE CHILDREN.

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:40.811
WE MUST ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:42.245
WOMEN'S ABILITY TO HAVE THE

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:43.880
CHILDREN THEY WANT AS WELL WELL

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.215
AS THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE THOSE

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:47.718
CHILDREN'S AND SAFE ENVIRONMENTS.

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:49.419
POLICIES CONSISTENT WITH THIS

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:50.287
PERSPECTIVE INCLUDE THOSE

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:52.189
ENSURING RESPECTFUL MATERNITY

00:49:52.255 --> 00:49:53.924
CARE FOR ALL BIRTHING PEOPLE.

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:55.392
AS WELL AS PUBLIC FUNDING OF

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:57.361
INFERTILITY SERVICES.

00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:58.428
ONLY BY THINKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S

00:49:58.495 --> 00:49:59.563
REPRODUCTIVE LIVES MORE

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.164
HOLISTICALLY AS OPPOSED TO

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:02.666
SEILING OUT ABORTION AND

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:05.102
CONTRACEPTION CAN WE ENSURE AND

00:50:05.168 --> 00:50:06.136
HONOR THEIR REPRODUCTIVE

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.237
AUTONOMY.

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.372
CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP AND

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:09.306
TAKING THIS TYPE OF PERSPECTIVE

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.408
WAS SEEN IN THE FIGHT OVER THE

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:12.576
MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT RULE.

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:14.244
I HOPE THIS VISION OF HONORING

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:15.545
AND SUPPORTING REPRODUCTIVE

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:16.913
AUTONOMY ACROSS THE REPRODUCTIVE

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.814
LIFE COURSE.

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:19.349
CAN CONTINUE TO ANIMATE AND

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:21.118
MOTIVATE OUR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.953
POLICY MOVING FORWARD.

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:25.489
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:27.424
THANK YOU ALL FOR FRAMING THIS

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:28.992
CONVERSATION OF SUCH A POWERFUL

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:30.260
WAY.

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:32.429
I WOULD OPEN UP TO MY COLLEAGUES

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:32.963
GIVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.531
PANELISTS [inaudible]

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:37.768
NEW.

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:39.369
I WILL I WILL I WANT TO THANK

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:40.437
YOU ALL.

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:42.472
FOR COMING AND PARTICIPATING IN

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:44.040
THIS SELECT COMMITTEE AND I WANT

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:45.776
TO THANK THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE --

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:47.744
FOR SPENDING YOUR THURSDAY

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.780
AFTERNOON OR LATE MORNING WITH

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:50.747
US TALKING ABOUT A CRITICAL

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.783
ISSUE I'M PROBABLY -- I SHOULD

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.885
JUST SAY I'M BIASED WHEN IT

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:57.421
COMES TO THIS ISSUE I MAY PROUD

00:50:57.487 --> 00:51:00.924
BOARD MEMBER ON PPL WAY -- IN

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:03.894
I'M IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF MY

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.064
BODY ALWAYS.

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:09.566
BUT I I WANTED -- TO ASK A

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:12.569
QUESTION BASED ON YOUR COMMENTS

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:14.204
DR BECAUSE I TOO AM WONDERING

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:15.705
WHAT TRENDS DO YOU SEE ACROSS

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.340
OTHER STATES ALTHOUGH I KNOW

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:18.942
MANY OTHER STATES ARE.

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:20.977
SORT OF LESS FLEXIBLE -- THAN

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.712
OURS BUT WHAT TRENDS DO YOU SEE

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:24.881
HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:26.917
NORMALIZE THE CONVERSATION

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:28.852
AROUND -- REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.353
AND FAMILY PLANNING IN A WAY

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.622
THAT'S ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WOMEN

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.825
ALL KINDS OF WOMEN ALL AGES I

00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:36.793
STILL THINK TO YOUR POINT THAT

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:37.961
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FAMILY

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:40.330
PLANNING WERE OFTEN TIMES -- THE

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:41.832
ASSUMPTION IS THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:51:41.898 --> 00:51:43.700
ABOUT ABORTION -- BUT IT'S MUCH

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.902
LARGER THAN THAT IT'S HELPING

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.237
YOUNG WOMEN UNDERSTAND.

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:48.905
SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS AND

00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:50.907
PROVIDERS IT'S BEGINNING TO TALK

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:53.210
ABOUT HOW THE INFORMATION -- IN

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.911
THE AMBASSADORS TO HEALTHCARE

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:57.447
INFORMATION MIGHT NOT BE AS

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:00.050
CULTURALLY SPECIFIC -- AS WOMEN

00:52:00.116 --> 00:52:00.984
WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE IT'S

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:02.686
HAVING HONEST CONVERSATIONS

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.788
ABOUT HOW WOMEN ACTUALLY FIRST.

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:07.524
GET INFORMED ABOUT FAMILY

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.226
PLANNING -- AND IF THOSE PEOPLE

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.727
ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND IF

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.728
THEY'RE SHARING WITH THEM THE

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.430
RIGHT INFORMATION SO FROM A

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.332
POLICY STANDPOINT FROM THE

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:17.300
STATE'S LANDS YOU KNOW WHAT

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:19.703
POLICIES CAN WE BEGIN TO THINK

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:24.140
ABOUT. TO KIND OF HELP RESET

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:28.645
THAT PARADIGM.

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:30.914
SO I THINK THAT I THINK THIS

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.482
CENTRALLY GOES BACK TO MY MY

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:33.583
THESIS WHICH IS THAT

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.018
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE NEEDS

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.419
TO BE CONSIDERED AS HEALTH CARE.

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.588
AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE OFTEN IS

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:40.023
TO CONSIDER IT AS A SEPARATE

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.591
ISSUE AND TALK ABOUT IT

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:44.227
DIFFERENTLY AND THEREFORE WE

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:46.429
CREATES STIGMA WE CREATE

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.398
BARRIERS WE INNER INTERACT WITH

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:50.267
THAT OUTSIDE OF THE REST OF THE

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:52.202
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.037
INTERFERES WITH ACCESS TO CARE.

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:55.839
AND IN WHICH WE DON'T INTEGRATE

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:57.807
SERVICES FOR ADOLESCENTS FOR

00:52:57.874 --> 00:52:59.476
EXAMPLE AS PART OF MY FAMILY

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:00.744
PLANNING SORRY MY FAMILY

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.280
MEDICINE PRACTICE I TAKE CARE OF

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:05.448
OF PEOPLE FROM. ZERO TO A

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:07.284
HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND PART OF MY

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:10.320
PRACTICE IS WHEN A PATIENT IS AT

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:11.488
WHERE IT MAY BE TAKEN CARE OF

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:12.455
SINCE THEY WERE BORN COMES IN AT

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:14.457
AGE. TWELVE TO THIRTEEN I ASK

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:15.625
THE PARENT IF I CAN TALK TO THE

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.561
PATIENT TO THE TO THE CHILD BY

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:18.862
THEMSELVES AND I HAVE A BLOOD

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:20.463
CONVERSATION WITH THEM.

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.532
ABOUT THEIR CONFIDENTIALITY WHAT

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:23.967
RIGHTS THEY HAVE TO TO QUALITY

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:25.001
HEALTHCARE AND ABOUT HOW THEY

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:26.503
CAN ACCESS HEALTH CARE MOVING

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.537
FORWARD.

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:28.772
AND I TALK TO THEM BOTH ABOUT

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:29.973
GETTING HEALTH CARE FOR ME BUT

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.241
ALSO RECOGNIZING THEY MAY NOT

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:32.709
WANT TO GET HEALTH CARE FOR ME

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.110
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:35.245
GETTING IT IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:37.147
THEIR FAMILY WHERE THEY CAN GET

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:37.681
HEALTH.

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.282
SEPARATELY AND I THINK IT IS THE

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:40.150
RESPONSIBILITY OF ME AS A

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:41.751
HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO MAKE SURE

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:44.154
THAT THOSE TRANSITIONS OF CARE.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.324
ARE SEAMLESS AND THAT WE ENSURE

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:48.558
THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:50.293
INFORMATION THEY NEED I ALSO

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.528
WANT TO RECOGNIZE THOUGH.

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:53.663
THAT BECAUSE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.265
CARE IS CONSIDERED SO SEPARATELY

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:57.734
IN OUR SOCIETY WE NEED TO MAKE

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:58.535
SURE THAT THERE ARE OTHER

00:53:58.602 --> 00:54:00.103
AVENUES AS YOU REFERENCE FOR

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.471
PEOPLE TO GET THE INFORMATION

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:02.272
THEY NEED.

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:04.574
PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY LOOKING

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:05.842
FOR INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET.

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.377
THROUGH -- MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:09.346
FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.081
WAYS THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT

00:54:11.147 --> 00:54:15.819
THIS INFORMATION IS CORRECT.

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:17.053
ACCURATE SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:17.554
AND AGE APPROPRIATE IS

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:23.860
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:24.160
[inaudible]

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:25.795

HAVE MISSED IT BUT I WAS

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:32.936
LISTENING TO YOU TALK ABOUT SOME

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:34.371
OF THE DISPARITIES IN AWARENESS.

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:35.939
ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE CARE AMONG

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:38.241
ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS AND

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:40.210
JUST DISPARITIES INFORMATION

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:41.211
BETWEEN VARIOUS POPULATIONS.

AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.418

ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN RAISE

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:54.224
AWARENESS AMONG.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.492
THE POPULATION GLOBALLY AND

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:56.626
AMONG YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT MAY

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:58.161

THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:10.640
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE

GREAT DATA. TO NOTE ACROSS A

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.844
POPULATION LEVEL HOW MUCH

SHOW THAT OVERALL THERE'S A

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:26.389
LARGE WAY TO GO FOR US TO MAKE

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:28.491
SURE THAT THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.326

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:31.928
RECEIVE.

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:34.230

THEIR CONFIDENTIAL.

AND WE ARE LEADERS HERE IN

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:38.334
CALIFORNIA IN THE SENSE THAT WE

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.703
HAVE VERY PROGRESSIVE

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.371
REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.306
SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION WITH THE

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:44.674
CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT BUT

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:46.142
THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO TO

00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:47.010
ENSURE.

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.144
THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:50.714
COMPLYING WITH THAT AND

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.415
LEGISLATION.

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:54.884
I ALSO WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:56.252

PROGRAMS ARE REALLY AND QUITE

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:13.536
POWERFUL FOR GOING OUTSIDE OF

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:15.238
THE SCHOOL SETTING AND IN SOME

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.006

AND YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:46.836
THAT WE CAN ACCESS YOUR RESEARCH

THAT WOULD BE GREAT WE CAN.

00:56:48.004 --> 00:56:49.639
TAKE A LOOK AT IT LATER BUT I'M

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:50.273

RELATED TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:21.371
CARE IN ASKED YOU GUYS BIRTH

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:23.640
CONTROL CANCER WHERE WE GOING IS

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:28.344
A STATE.

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:29.579
SIR WHAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.481
WE WERE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:32.582
ADDRESS THIS YEAR IS REALLY THE

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:34.317
S. T. I. S. T. D. HIV.

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.352
PEPSI CRISIS THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:37.487
ACTUALLY IN IN THAT NOT THAT

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:40.423
MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE AWARE OF

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.926
WE RANK AMONG THE WORST FOR

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:45.595
SYPHILIS FOR CHLAMYDIA IN THE

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:49.833
ENTIRE COUNTRY -- AND WE HAD

00:57:49.899 --> 00:57:53.102
REQUESTED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:53.570
TO ADD.

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:56.539
AS THE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS HIV

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.074
SPECIFICALLY ANOTHER TWENTY

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.509
MILLION TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:02.679
HABSI ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION TO

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:03.613
GO AFTER OTHER STDS MESSY EYES.

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.381
IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AND I

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:06.683
BELIEVE ALL WE WERE AWARDED WAS

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:09.719
ABOUT FIVE MILLION TOTAL TO GO

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:12.422
AFTER THOSE THREE THINGS.

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:15.091
SO -- THIS IS A PRETTY ALARMING

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:17.126
ISSUE.

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:19.262
I SCOTT WINNER HAS A BILL THIS

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.564
YEAR THAT WOULD MAKE PREP AND

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:24.033
PERHAPS MUCH MORE AVAILABLE THAT

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.969
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:30.073
TOWARD ADDRESSING HIV CRISIS --

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:33.343
WE HAVE PARTY YOU KNOW WE HAVE A

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:34.911
A PREVENTATIVE CURE NOW. TO

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:37.113
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF HIV IT IS

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.648
ABSURD THAT WE ARE MAKING IT

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:40.250
MUCH MORE READILY AVAILABLE.

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.951
AND SO WE'RE SUPPORTING THAT

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.653
THAT LEGISLATION -- BUT YEAH SO

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.021
SPECIFICALLY ON THAT POINT

00:58:45.088 --> 00:58:47.557
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:53.596
ON STDS AND ESTAS.

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:54.197
DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON HOW I

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:56.299
MEAN THOSE.

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.700
CHOOSE IF YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE

00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:59.602
QUITE ALARMING AND YOU ALSO

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:00.136
MENTIONED SENATOR WIENER

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:00.770
SPELLING FUNDING ARE THERE OTHER

00:59:00.837 --> 00:59:02.772
THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING TO

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:04.741
ADDRESS THAT CRISIS IN OUR STATE.

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:07.243
A LOT OF IT I THINK HAS TO DO

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.878
WITH -- YOU KNOW DURING THE

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:10.246
RECESSION PROGRAMS WERE CUT

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:12.448
SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAVE NOT COME

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:13.750
BACK.

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:15.919
TO RE EVALUATE WHERE THE FUNDING

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:17.487
IS FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT IS

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.488
MUCH OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:20.056
ASKING FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:20.690
MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS PACKAGE

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:21.457
AND THAT WAS.

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.493
A SIGNIFICANT COALITION OF THE

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:25.561
REPRODUCTIVE.

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:26.930
RE AND RIGHTS AND JUSTICE

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:27.797
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD SPUR

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:30.266
SIGNED ON TO THAT -- TO THAT

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:31.668
BUDGET PROPOSAL.

00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:35.371
SO -- YEAH I MEAN I I'M NOT NAY

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:36.839
REAL IS NOT THE LEAD ON S. T. S.

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:39.008
T. I WORK BUT I'M.

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:41.044
BUT WE A TON OF INFORMATION I'M

CALIFORNIA.

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:49.018
AS IT RELATES.

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:51.621
TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE.

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:54.457
ARE WE SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.392
HOW MANY COUNTIES DON'T HAVE

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.027
ABORTION CLINICS FOR EXAMPLE OF

00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:59.829
WHAT DIRECTION ARE WE GOING AND

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:00.463
I WE KNOW THE CURRENT STATE OF

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.966
THINGS IS THAT.

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.200
MATT HEY WE GOT IN THE WRONG

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.401
DIRECTION CAN YOU GUYS GIVE US

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:08.972
SOME INSIGHT WHAT YOU SEEN.

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:10.673
I CAN SPEAK IN TERMS OF TRENDS

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.775
IN ACCESS AND USE OF

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.978
CONTRACEPTION AND OVERALL AT THE

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.079
NATIONAL LEVEL AND HERE IN

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:17.647
CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEEN AN

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.549
INCREASE IN USE OF LONG ACTING

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:22.185
REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:22.785
IN.

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:25.488
AN IMPLANT BUT OVERALL THERE'S

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.223
BàN AND THE RATES OF USE OF ANY

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.558
CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD HAVE

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:30.126
REMAINED STABLE.

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:31.894
SO IT'S A AND IT'S A LITTLE

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:35.932
PUZZLING THAT WITH THE WITH THE

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.967
GENEROUS AND STATE PROGRAMS THAT

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:40.303
WE HAVE AN INCREASES IN

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.105
INSURANCE Y. L. WHY WE'RE NOT

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:42.472
SEEING A BIGGER.

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:46.042
AND SEEING ANY INCREASE AND

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:50.980
CONTRACEPTIVE USE IN GENERAL.

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.081
I'M I ALSO IS I MEAN IT WAS.

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:52.715
SO INTERESTING TO HEAR ABOUT THE

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.852
IMPLICIT BIAS NOT JUST IN --

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:58.621
KAREN CHILDBIRTH BUT ALSO IN AND

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.957
BIRTH CONTROL AND I WITH THAT

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.258
LANDS I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.793
SENATOR MITCHELL'S BILL BUT I

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.994
HOPE IT ADDRESSES SORT OF THE

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:06.596
IMPLICIT BIAS IN CARE FOR WOMEN

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:07.597
FROM.

01:01:07.663 --> 01:01:09.332
CRADLE TO GRAVE BECAUSE IT TURNS

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.200
OUT THERE'S A HUGE ISSUE IN THE

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:12.602
WHERE PROVIDING CARE TO WOMEN OF

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:15.938
COLOR -- SO THANK YOU.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:18.141
FOR SHEDDING LIGHT ON THAT ISSUE --

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.208
SO.

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:20.710
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:22.412
COMING IN FOR HELPING US.

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:27.517
SET THE STAGE ON THE ISSUES AND

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.152
MEMBERSHIP.

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:29.652
SO I'VE HI MOM.

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:30.219
IT WAS STRUCK BY SOME OF THE

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:31.754
COMMENTS AROUND THE INCORRECT

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:34.924
RICE'S AROUND STD RATES AND THIS

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:35.625
PAST YEAR THE BUDGET CYCLE I

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.460
ALSO HAD -- A SPECIFIC BUDGET

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.062
REQUESTS AROUND SOME OF THESE

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:41.197
ISSUES THAT DID NOT GET MATT --

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:43.499
AND THE FACT IS OUR STD RATES

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:46.436
ARE AT A TWENTY FIVE YEAR HIGH --

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:48.671
WE LEAD THE NATION AND GONORRHEA

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:51.841
CHLAMYDIA.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:54.377
LA LEADS THE STATE IN BOTH --

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:57.246
ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT A WE HAVE

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:59.048
THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF BABIES

01:01:59.115 --> 01:01:59.682
BORN WITH SYPHILIS EVERY YEAR.

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:00.483
WITH THESE NUMBERS ARE

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.585
ASTRONOMICAL AND ARE NOT REALLY

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:05.855
BEINGDISCUSSED -- PUBLICLY

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:06.622
COULD YOU TALK A BIT MORE YOU

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:07.757
KIND OF ALLUDED TO THIS BUT WHAT

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.092
DO YOU SEE AS THE REASONS I

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:10.660
THINK WE ALL DO BELIEVE THAT

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.261
INVESTMENT.

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.197
OF BUDGET DOLLARS IS CRITICAL

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.165
BUT IT SO MUCH THE REPRODUCTIVE

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:17.266
HEALTH CONVERSATION IS IS

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.669
FOCUSED ON ABORTION AND THE PRO

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.104
CHOICE FIGHT BUT THERE IS A

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.739
BROADER CONTEXT HERE THAT --

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:26.409
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TACKLE

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:27.043
WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE SOME

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.612
FEEDBACK ON THAT.

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:31.380
SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT IN THE

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:32.615
COMMENT ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS I I

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:33.349
WANNA MAKE THE POINT THAT I

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.718
THINK THAT RESPECTFUL CARE IN

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.253
THE CONTEXT OF WOMEN WHO ARE NOT

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.222
PREGNANT IS ACTUALLY MANY TIMES

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:40.556
EVEN A BIGGER CONCERN.

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:42.125
BECAUSE THESE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.693
TRYING NOT TO BE PREGNANT AND

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:44.961
THAT COMES WITH A SET OF

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:46.262
SOCIETAL STIGMA AND JUDGMENT

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.197
WOMEN WHO ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.565
BUT DO NOT WANT TO BE PREGNANT.

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.033
AND SO THERE ARE ISSUES WITH

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.401
RESPECTFUL CARE IN THAT CONTEXT

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.370
AND SPECIFICALLY DIFFERENTIAL

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.905
RESPECTIVE -- DISRESPECT TOWARDS

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.507
WOMEN OF COLOR THAT I THINK

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.642
ABSOLUTELY IMPACTS BOTH USE OF

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:01.677
CONTRACEPTION AND USE OF

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:02.945
SERVICES RELATED TO SEXUALLY

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:04.547
TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS SCREENING

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.115
TESTING AND TREATMENT.

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:07.250
AND SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:08.151
BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT IS

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.318
NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.621
CURRENT BILL DOES ADDRESS IT IN

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.389
THE FAMILY PLANNING CONTEXT --

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.257
STAYS BY MY COLLEAGUE DR NEW

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.092
GOMEZ AT BERKELEY HAS FOUND THAT

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.660
WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCES RESPECTFUL

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:18.528
CARE IN THE FAMILY PLANNING

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:20.563
CONTEXT ARE LESS LIKELY TO COME

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.931
BACK FOR CARE IN THE FUTURE.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.132
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:24.000
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.434
PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO AS A

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:26.836
WAY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:28.704
GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED WHEN

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.139
THEY NEED IT WITH RESPECT EVERY

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:31.174
FOR CONTRACEPTION.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.875
ABORTION BUT AUTHORED ALSO WITH

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:34.277
RESPECT TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.312
INFECTIONS AND I WOULD ALSO ADD

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:37.880
THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:38.981
DISPARITIES IN FOR TWO WILL

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.082
INFERTILITY RATES IN THE UNITED

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:40.883
STATES.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:41.951
THAT WOMEN OF COLOR ARE MORE

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.085
LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE TO

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.086
INFERTILITY RELATED TO THEIR

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.588
HIGHER LATE RATES OF SEXUALLY

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.123
TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND THE

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.658
SAME WOMEN HAVE LESS ACCESS TO

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:51.427
INFERTILITY SERVICES BECAUSE OF

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.296
FINANCIAL BARRIERS AND THAT IS A

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.230
AN ISSUE THAT IS.

CHILDREN I THINK THAT.

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:30.700
WE FOCUS ON THE RIGHT TO TEN

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:31.867
ABORTION BECAUSE IT IS SO

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.703
CONSTANTLY UNDER ATTACK AND FOR

NAY ROUTE WE ARE KNOWN AS THE

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:36.706
ABORTION RIGHTS ORGANIZATION.

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:37.907
BUT WE ALSO WORK ON THE FULL

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.076

AGAINST IN YOUR WORKPLACE.

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.189
BECAUSE YOU ARE PREGNANT BUT YOU

THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:20.750
DONE IN BOTH.

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:25.421
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT REPRODUCTION

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:26.222
IS USED AS A TOOL OF OPPRESSION.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.090
WHETHER THAT IS.

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:31.160

TO CARRY A PREGNANCY TO TERM

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:40.469
EITHER IS A FORM OF OPPRESSION

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:42.305
AND WE HAVE TO REALLY BE ACTIVE

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.173
ON ALL SIDES OF THIS TO ENSURE

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.275

I KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN TWO

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.395
BUT I JUST WANTED -- TO KNOW IF

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.497
THERE'S ANY DATA ON THE MAKE UP

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:10.399

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:18.174
OF COLOR.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.642
WE'RE ALSO SORT OF TALKING ABOUT

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:20.910

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.026

OUT IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:09.143
CENTERS ARE GROWING -- WE HAVE

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:11.512

THESE ARE THINGS WE DO AS ON A

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:30.298
DAILY BASIS WONDERING WHAT.

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:31.699
THE NEXT SHOE WILL DROP AND WHAT

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:33.234

DOOR WE CALL IT LOOKING OUT FOR

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:47.348
THE CRAZY -- AND THIS IS

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:49.383
SOMETHING THAT LEADS TO A HIGH

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:50.384
LEVEL OF ANXIETY AMONG THEIR

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:51.552

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.159
DANGEROUS THING MIGHT BE COMING

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:00.394
FROM WE DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN

01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:02.830
TO PREPARE -- BUT WE HAVE TO

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:04.432
DEAL WITH THINGS THAT OTHER

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:06.267
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS DON'T WE

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:08.269

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:14.008
WHAT TO DO OF SOMETHING'S LEFT --

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:16.110
I GET CALLS REGULARLY ABOUT

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:18.846
BACKPACKS LEFT IN WAITING ROOMS

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.014
AND NORMALLY THAT'S A SIMPLE

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:21.816
LOST AND FOUND SITUATION THAT

01:30:21.883 --> 01:30:23.651
OUR HEALTH CENTERS WE OFTEN HAVE

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.253
TO CALL IN THE FBI TO COME.

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:27.755
AND CLEAR THE PACKAGE -- BECAUSE

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:28.589
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:31.292
BACKPACK -- IS SO THERE'S A

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:35.663
LEVEL OF HIGHER CONCERN OF WE

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:36.831
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:39.734
HAPPEN AND BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.737

CALIFORNIA AND EVEN STRONGER

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:48.609

PROVE A POINT -- SO WE ARE

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:53.881
SEEING INCREASED A POTESTER

ACTIVITY AT OUR HEALTH CENTERS

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:58.085
IN CALIFORNIA THEY WANT TO MAKE

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:00.588
IT SO OUR PATIENTS CAN'T.

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:01.889
OR DON'T WANT TO SPEAK SERVICES

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:04.025
AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD SO THAT WE

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:05.293
WILL HAVE TO SHUT OUR DOORS.

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.994
AND JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD A

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:09.130
PATIENT COME BACK INTO THE

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:11.332
HEALTH CENTER CRYING AT RBC

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:13.868
LOCATION IN SACRAMENTO BECAUSE

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:15.703
SHE FELT THE PROTESTERS WERE

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.271
BLOCKING HER FROM GOING TO HER

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:18.539
CAR SHE WAS BEING FOLLOWED TO

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:19.574
HER CAR.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.442
AND TOLD ALL THE REASONS WHY SHE

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:24.345
WAS A BAD PERSON FOR COMING FOR

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:25.746
SERVICES AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.148
AFTER HER VISIT SHE WAS JUST

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:28.416
TRYING TO GO HOME.

01:31:28.482 --> 01:31:30.551
AND SHE CAME BACK IN AND OUR

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.753
STAFF WALKED HER TO OUR CARS IS

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.722
THAT SHE WOULD FEEL SAFE BECAUSE

01:31:34.789 --> 01:31:36.123
SHE HAD TO PARK ON THE STREET ON

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:37.158
THAT DAY BECAUSE IT WAS A DAY

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:38.759
THAT WE USUALLY DON'T HAVE

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:39.627
PROTESTERS.

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:41.896
WE ACTUALLY ASK OUR STAFF TO

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:43.431
PARK ON THE STREET ON THE DAYS

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:44.899
THAT WE HAVE PROTESTERS SO THAT

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:46.167
THEY GET TO WALK THROUGH THE

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:47.768
PROTESTORS AND OUR PATIENTS

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:50.037
DON'T HAVE -- TO BUT THESE ARE

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:52.940
THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:56.510

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:57.745
OTHER.

01:31:57.812 --> 01:31:59.480
UNIQUE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:00.047
DEAL WITH IS.

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:01.883
INCONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS

01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:04.752
LOCAL ORDINANCES -- ONE OF OUR

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:06.120
HEALTH CENTERS OF HAVING A

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:09.924
GETTING TRESPASSED AND FORCE

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.459
BECAUSE THE PROTESTERS WANT TO

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.394
COME ON THE PROPERTY -- TO

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:14.996
PROTEST AND THE LOCAL LAW

01:32:15.062 --> 01:32:16.931
ENFORCEMENT SAYS ITS FIRST

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:17.665
AMENDMENT WE CANNOT FORCE

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:19.667
TRESPASS HERE -- YOU KNOW MOST

A SITUATION BECAUSE IT'S TRUST

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:25.673
PASS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.508
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING -- BUT THE

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.210
SELECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:36.784
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND DE

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:40.287
STIGMATIZING -- ABORTION SO IT'S

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.922
JUST PART OF YOU KNOW MOST OF

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:43.624
OUR CENTERS PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:44.959
HEALTH CARE IN SOME PROVIDE

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:46.093
PRIMARY CARE.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.828
AND SO WE'VE REALLY DONE A GREAT

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:49.496
JOB WITH THAT OF COURSE FUNDING

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:51.532
HAS HELPED SOME OF THE BARRIERS

01:37:51.599 --> 01:37:55.035
TO CARE THAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE.

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:57.371
OF OUR NUMBER ONE REASON FOR NO

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:59.006
SHOW FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR CENTRAL

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.508
VALLEY AREA IS TRANSPORTATION.

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:04.278
SO BEING ABLE FOR OUR PATIENTS

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:05.212
TO ACCESS SOME FORM OF

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:07.548
TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO THEIR

01:38:07.615 --> 01:38:09.750
HEALTH CENTER IS VITALLY

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:11.852
IMPORTANT -- THAT'S I WOULD SAY

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:13.554
ONE OF MY NUMBER ONE REASONS AND

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:15.956
THEN ALSO HAVING PROVIDERS AT

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:17.791
OUR HEALTH CENTERS THE WHAT HAS

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.460
HAPPENED AND THE REIMBURSEMENT

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.762
INCREASE HAS REALLY MADE A HUGE

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:23.764
DIFFERENCE. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:26.000
HIDE PROVIDE HIGHER PROVIDERS IF

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.368
YOU DON'T HAVE PROVIDERS YOU

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:29.203
CAN'T PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:30.504
PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:32.706
WHERE IT'S MUCH MORE CHALLENGING.

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:34.742
TO BE ABLE TO HIRE PROVIDERS IT

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:37.011
MAKES A DIFFERENCE WE'VE HAD TO

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:38.812
DO THINGS TO YOU KNOW INCREASE

01:38:38.879 --> 01:38:41.715
OUR SALARIES INCREASE OUR BONUS

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:42.883
AND RETENTION.

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:45.119
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR

01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:47.354
PEOPLE TO WORK IN RURAL AREAS IF

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:49.456
THEIR PARTNER DOESN'T HAVE A JOB

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:50.924
AND IF THEY CAN'T FIND HOUSING.

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:52.559
SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF A

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:54.495
BARRIERS AND THAT REALLY LIMITS

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:56.330
THE CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE IF WE

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.465
DON'T HAVE A A PROVIDER THAT'S

01:38:58.532 --> 01:38:59.133
THERE BUT I WOULD SAY.

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:01.135
TRANSPORTATION IS OUR NUMBER ONE

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:02.369
ISSUE AND GETTING SAFE

01:39:02.436 --> 01:39:04.338
TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE WE ARE

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:05.472
LOOKING AT PARTNERING WITH

01:39:05.539 --> 01:39:07.775
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:39:07.841 --> 01:39:09.143
PROVIDE THAT TRANSPORTATION.

01:39:09.209 --> 01:39:10.411
BUT OF COURSE IT'S REALLY

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:11.412
IMPORTANT THAT IT'S SAFE AND

01:39:11.478 --> 01:39:16.150
CONFIDENTIAL FOR OUR PATIENTS

01:39:16.216 --> 01:39:16.717
THAT ARE GOING TO OUR HEALTH

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.686
CENTERS.

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:20.187
CAN I WOULD HAVE TO GO MS

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:21.088
CROSSES COMMENTS OF IT THAT'S

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:22.423
EXACTLY TRANSPORTATION ISN'T

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.925
URBAN ISSUE AS WELL -- AND I

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:26.093
DON'T HAVE TO TELL MY ASSEMBLY

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.062
MEMBER PARKING -- AND THE CITY

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:29.697
IS A MASSIVE ISSUED AT THE CAN A

01:39:29.763 --> 01:39:30.731
CASE IN POINT IT SOUNDS TONGUE

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.866
IN CHEEK BUT A CASE IN POINT.

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:35.035
WE WILL AT JUST OUR THREE

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.403
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES HEALTH

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:37.838
CENTERS IN THE COMING YEAR SPENT

01:39:37.905 --> 01:39:39.106
OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.408
DOLLARS IN PARKING FOR OUR

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:42.576
PATIENTS -- IN BEEN PARKING

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:45.579
SUBSIDIES OF NOT TO MENTION EVEN

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:46.480
GOING DOWN THE PATH OF BUS

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:49.083
TOKENS AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION.

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:50.951
ISSUES ANOTHER WAY THE ASSEMBLY

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:53.787
CAN HELP IS CONTINUE TO EXPAND

01:39:53.854 --> 01:39:55.322
THE AVAILABILITY OF LOAN

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:57.858
REPAYMENT -- FOR CLINICIANS WHO

01:39:57.925 --> 01:39:59.426
ARE COMING ON BOARD AND OTHER

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:01.295
STAFF WERE DEDICATING THEIR

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:03.163
CAREERS TO A LOW INCOME

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:06.700
POPULATION -- PROVIDING THE THE

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:09.336
RETENTION OF FONG THAT YOU'VE

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.038
DONE WITH LOAN REPAYMENT IN THE

01:40:11.105 --> 01:40:13.474
PAST THAT ALLOWS THE CLINICIANS

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:14.541
TO ACCESS THAT.

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:16.610
WITH WITH PHYSICIANS AND NURSE

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:18.312
PRACTITIONERS MIDWIVES --

01:40:18.379 --> 01:40:20.280
DENTISTS IN ALL COMING OUT OF

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:21.882
TRAINING WITH A QUARTER OF A

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:23.550
MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:25.786
STUDENT LOAN DEBT COUPLED WITH

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:27.855
THE MEDIAN HOUSING PRICE IN LOS

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:29.256
ANGELES MEANS THAT WE HAVE A

01:40:29.323 --> 01:40:31.058
HARD TIME RECRUITING AND

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:33.660
RETAINING -- PROVIDERS LONG TERM

01:40:33.727 --> 01:40:36.363
AND IT'S A IT'S A TREMENDOUS

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:37.998
IT'S A TREMENDOUS BARRIER WHEN

01:40:38.065 --> 01:40:40.534
YOU THINK THAT A PHYSICIAN CAN'T

01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:42.002
CHOOSE TO WORK IN THE STATE OF

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.070
CALIFORNIA.

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:44.738
BECAUSE THE FIZZ A PHYSICIAN

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:46.173
CANNOT AFFORD TO RENT AN

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:53.514
APARTMENT NEAR THE OFFICE.

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:54.982
HI I ECHO THAT THE NUMBER ONE

01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:56.283
REASON I LOSE PROVIDERS IS LOAN

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:57.651
REPAYMENT -- AND THAT IS THAT IS

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:58.719
HUGE PARTICULAR FOR A MID LEVEL

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:00.087
PROVIDERS WE CAN'T BE

01:41:00.154 --> 01:41:01.922
COMPETITIVE.

01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:03.390
OUR SOME OF DO YOU SEE THE

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:04.758
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:05.993
RELATED TO THE ISSUES

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:07.795
INVESTMENTS GET TALKED ABOUT.

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:10.564
RELIGIOUS SAFETY AND SECURITY.

01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:12.065
CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN SO WE

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:12.633
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:13.834
WITH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.369
OF PROVIDERS RELATED.

01:41:15.436 --> 01:41:17.137
TO FINANCING BUT DOES THE SAFETY

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:18.372
AND SECURITY ISSUES THAT YOU'RE

01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:20.641
CLINICS FACE AS DESCRIBED BY

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:21.675
MISSING ASKEY ALSO AFFECT

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:25.245
CRIMINAL INTENTION OF PROVIDERS.

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:28.081
OR DO NOT SEE A CONNECTION.

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:29.850
YEAH GO AHEAD AND THEN ALL AT I

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:30.851
KNOW THAT I SPEND A LARGE AMOUNT

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:33.187
OF MY TIME ACTING AS A COUNSELOR

01:41:33.253 --> 01:41:35.088
TO OUR STAFF AND A LOT OF WHAT I

01:41:35.155 --> 01:41:36.190
DO IS LETTING THEM TALK ABOUT

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:38.659
THE THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:38.992
TO DEAL WITH.

01:41:39.059 --> 01:41:41.161
JUST TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY --

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:42.529
I HAD ONE OF ONE OF OUR

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:44.565
EDUCATORS WITH MAD BECAUSE HE

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:45.566
HAS TO ASK.

01:41:45.632 --> 01:41:47.234
THE THE LARGE NUMBER OF

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:49.803
PROTESTERS INSIDE OF THE HEALTH

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.572
CENTER ARE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:52.873
CENTER TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:53.707
JUST TO WALK ON THE SIDEWALK SO

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:56.176
HE CAN GET TO HIS JOB EVERY DAY

01:41:56.243 --> 01:41:59.179
AND THAT WEARS ON AND SO.

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:00.647
I I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE COME

01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:01.582
TO WORK AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:03.550
BECAUSE OF THE MISSION AND THAT

01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:06.053
HELPS TO COUNTERACT.

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:09.056
THAT THE FEELING -- BUT THERE

01:42:09.122 --> 01:42:09.690
ARE PEOPLE.

01:42:09.756 --> 01:42:11.225

ASSISTANT LEVEL PEOPLE WHO COME

THERE JUST FOR A JOB.

01:42:18.932 --> 01:42:20.567
A ONE OF PAY THEIR BILLS AND

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:23.237
THEY WANT A CAREER AND AND THEY

01:42:23.303 --> 01:42:24.805
DON'T WANT TO PUT UP.

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:25.973
WITH THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:29.409
DEAL WITH AND THEY WILL GO -- TO

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:31.011
A HOSPITAL SETTING AT KAISER

01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:32.546
SETTING A DOCTOR'S OFFICE

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:38.018
SETTING IF THEY'RE NOT.

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:39.219
IF IT'S NOT COUNTERACTED BY THE

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:40.387

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:47.160
OUR WORK SO IT DOES BALANCE BUT

THE I DO KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:42:48.862 --> 01:42:50.464

THROUGH PEOPLE SCREAMING AT THEM

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:54.201
EVERY DAY AND NOT KNOWING WHAT'S

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:10.570
HEARING SUCH AS THIS IS THAT

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:12.239
THERE'S NO NEED TO SUGAR COAT IT

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:13.440
THE FACT IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:15.175
BOMB THREATS THERE HAS BEEN OUR

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:17.244
CENTER HAS BEEN OPENED FIRE THE

01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:19.046

A PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC.

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:22.582
THE DANGER IS NOT ONLY TO THE

PATIENTS BUT TO THE STAFF AND

01:45:24.384 --> 01:45:25.852

REAL ISSUE.

THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND THERE'S A

01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:52.245
LOT THE CALICO THAT CALIFORNIA

WITH INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS TO

01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:48.769
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY NEED -- ONE

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:51.304
ONE EXAMPLE -- WOULD BE -- WE

01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:53.707
PARTNER WITH A VARIETY OF

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.442
ORGANIZATIONS AND WITHIN THE

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:57.811
DELIVERY CARE THAT WE PROVIDE WE

01:46:57.878 --> 01:47:00.247
WORK WITH -- ALL COMERS SO IF A

01:47:00.313 --> 01:47:02.215
WOMAN HAS DECIDED TO HAVE A BABY

01:47:02.282 --> 01:47:03.683
WE'RE GOING TO PARTNER WITH THE

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:04.951
PRENATAL SETTING IN WHICH SHE'S

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:06.820
RECEIVED IF SHE'S GOING TO

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:07.921
DELIVER UNDER OUR ROOF.

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:09.723
SO NOT ALL OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:10.724
THEIR PRENATAL WITH US SOME OF

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:11.792
THEM HAVE IT WITH OTHER

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:13.426
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AROUND

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:16.329
LA AND EVEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS --

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:18.365
BUT WHAT'S REALLY CLEAR IS THAT

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:19.599
WE'RE AND SOME OF THOSE

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:21.301
ORGANIZATIONS DON'T PROVIDE

01:47:21.368 --> 01:47:23.170
FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES RIGHT

01:47:23.236 --> 01:47:24.604
THEY ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:27.407
SIMPLY STAY OUT OF THAT SPACE --

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:29.709
AND BUT WE'RE VERY CLEAR FOR

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:32.879
INSTANCE IN OUR AFFILIATION WITH

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:34.781
THEM THAT THEIR CLIENTS WILL

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:36.349
RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:39.052
PLANNING SERVICES AFTER DELIVERY.

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:40.954
THAT THEY WILL BE OFFERED A WIDE

01:47:41.021 --> 01:47:42.789
RANGE OF FAMILY PLANNING OPTIONS

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:45.792
WHEN THEY'RE HAVING THEIR THIRTY

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:46.393
SIX THIRTY SEVEN WEEK VISITS

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:47.794
WITH OBSTETRICIANS AND MIDWIVES.

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:49.362
OF BECAUSE THAT STANDARD OF CARE

01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:51.364
AND THAT EVIDENCE BASE THAT WE

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:54.668
FOLLOW WILL NOT VERY -- BECAUSE

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:59.606
A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE ENGAGE IN.

01:47:59.673 --> 01:48:01.007
I THINK THE SOME OF THE EFFORTS

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:02.108
THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN.

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:04.778
BY OUR FANTASTIC OUR REGION

01:48:04.845 --> 01:48:05.879
HEALTH EDUCATION TEAM TO WORK

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:07.147
WITH VARIOUS FOUNDATIONS TO HOLD

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:09.616
CLASSES AND PARENTING CLASSES

01:48:09.683 --> 01:48:11.952
AND THE DADDY BOOT CAMP AND NOW

01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:14.354
LAUNCHING IN AREAS FOR THE LGBT

01:48:14.421 --> 01:48:16.556
Q. AYE POPULATION -- WHERE WE

01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:18.325
HAVE A INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:19.860
CHOOSING US FOR GENDERLESS

01:48:19.926 --> 01:48:22.295
EXPERIENCES PART OF THEIR -- AS

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:24.364
PART OF THEIR DELIVERY CARE AND

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:25.532
EXPANDING THEIR FAMILIES OF ARE

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:27.500
ALL TYPES OF INNOVATIONS THAT W

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:30.203
HAVE UNDER WAY -- BUT MOST

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:32.539
NOTABLY I THINK THE INNOVATION

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:34.541
IN THIS SPACE IS PARTIALLY QUITE

01:48:34.608 --> 01:48:36.977
SIMPLE IT'S GIVING THE PATIENT

01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:39.012
WITH THE PATIENT IS AFTER -- AND

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:41.248
NOT WHAT WE'RE AFTER SO -- IT'S

01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:42.849
SORT OF THE NEXT LEVEL OF THE

01:48:42.916 --> 01:48:44.284
THE GOLDEN RULE RIGHT IF THE

01:48:44.351 --> 01:48:45.886
GOLDEN RULE IS TREATING OTHERS

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:46.920
HOW YOU WISH TO BE TREATED THE

01:48:46.987 --> 01:48:48.622
PLATINUM ROLE IS TREATING PEOPLE

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:49.890
HAVE A WISH TO BE TREATED.

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:52.125
AND SO THAT'S THE MAXIMUM BY

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:55.662
WHICH REALLY WERE LIVING AND HOW

01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:58.298
WE'RE PROVIDING THIS CARE.

01:48:58.365 --> 01:48:59.666
SO -- OUR AFFILIATES HAVE WORKED

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:00.300
REALLY HARD WITH YOU ALL TO BE

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:02.435
ABLE TO ACCESS TELEMEDICINE FOR

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:03.670
OUR PATIENTS.

01:49:03.737 --> 01:49:05.805
AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:07.941
FOR SO MANY THINGS INCLUDING

01:49:08.008 --> 01:49:10.143
MEDICATION ABORTIONS -- TRANS

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:11.711
HEALTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH SO WE'RE

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:13.113
REALLY EXCITED WE ARE VERY

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:15.815
EXCITED ABOUT THAT WE ALSO SO

01:49:15.882 --> 01:49:17.717
MUCH INNOVATION HAS COME FROM

01:49:17.784 --> 01:49:19.052
PLANNED PARENTHOOD HERE IN

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:20.320
CALIFORNIA.

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:21.288
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:23.290
NOW HAVE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:25.859

01:49:25.926 --> 01:49:27.427
SO THAT YOU CAN ORDER YOUR PILLS

01:49:27.494 --> 01:49:29.195

BUT I THINK MEETING PATIENTS

01:49:50.283 --> 01:49:51.851
WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THAT MEANS

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:53.520

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:48.495
DIFFERENCE.

IT'S IT'S A DEVICE USED TO

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:40.573
DETERMINE WHETHER INDIVIDUALS

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.909

CITIZENS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:59:57.924 --> 02:00:00.893
CONFUSION -- BECAUSE OF THE FACT

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:01.594
THAT IT IMPACTS INDIVIDUALS

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:02.528
DIFFERENTLY IN A VERY CRITICAL

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:08.334

02:00:12.171 --> 02:00:13.105
AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE TAKEN

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:14.140
TO CONSIDERATION TO DEEM AN

02:00:14.206 --> 02:00:15.041

SERVICES OVER ALL.

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:38.464
SO WE REALLY THINK IT'S VERY

02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:39.565
IMPORTANT.

02:00:39.632 --> 02:00:41.467
THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR WORK

02:00:41.534 --> 02:00:42.468

IMMIGRANT ACCESS.

02:01:21.273 --> 02:01:23.476

WHEN THE NURSE CAME IN TO LET ME

KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE UNABLE

02:05:14.573 --> 02:05:16.008

I BROKE DOWN SOBBING ALL OF A

02:05:42.768 --> 02:05:44.837
SUDDEN THAT LATER BECAME REAL TO

02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:49.708
ETERNITY PROBABLY CLOSE TO FIVE

02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:52.044
MINUTES ADD TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

I WANTED FOR MY LIFE WHAT I WANT

02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:54.380
FOR MY FUTURE AND WHAT I WANT MY

02:05:54.446 --> 02:05:55.814
FAMILY TO LOOK LIKE.

02:05:55.881 --> 02:05:58.651
AND WHAT I KNEW IS THAT I DID

02:05:58.717 --> 02:05:59.852
NOT WANT TO HAVE A CHILD UNDER

02:05:59.919 --> 02:06:01.353
THAT DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WHAT

02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:02.988
I KNEW IS THAT I DO NOT WANT TO

02:06:03.055 --> 02:06:04.290
HAVE A FAMILY UNDER THE THREAT

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:05.791
OF DEPORTATION.

02:06:05.858 --> 02:06:07.526
AND WHAT I KNEW IS THAT I DID

02:06:07.593 --> 02:06:10.763
NOT HAVE THE EMOTIONAL CAPACITY

02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:13.866
TO FIGHT A DEPORTATION CASE AND

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:16.001
BE PREGNANT.

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:17.169
WHEN A NURSE CAME BACK IN I MADE

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:17.636
AN APPOINTMENT WITHOUT

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:19.171
CONSULTING ANYONE AND TWO DAYS

02:06:19.238 --> 02:06:20.339
LATER I HAD AN ABORTION?

02:06:20.406 --> 02:06:22.174
MY ABORTION WAS COMPLETELY

02:06:22.241 --> 02:06:24.176
ROUTINE UNEVENTFUL ASK ALL

02:06:24.243 --> 02:06:26.011
ABORTION SHOULD BE -- LIFE IS

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:27.546
COMPLICATED ENOUGH ACCESSING

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:29.515
YOUR HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT HAVE

02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:34.420
TO BE -- AND THAT WAS THE BEST

02:06:34.486 --> 02:06:35.454
DECISION THAT I COULD HAVE DONE

02:06:35.521 --> 02:06:36.622
FOR MYSELF AT THE TIME.

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:38.357

NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE SERVICE

02:06:56.642 --> 02:07:00.346
SILOS -- AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:01.647
THE EXPERIENCE THAT ANY PERSON

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:03.182

FROM IMMIGRATION POLICY

CHILDREN ARE US CITIZENS.

02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:58.997
A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE APPROACH

HEALTH REQUIRES THAT WE CONSIDER

02:14:03.068 --> 02:14:04.269
THE THREE TENANTS OF THE

02:14:04.336 --> 02:14:05.404

REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE SEE JUSTICE

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.162
IS THE LEGACY OF THE STRUGGLE OF

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:31.363
BLACK INDIGENOUS AND OTHER

02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:33.565

OTHER THINGS.

02:14:42.707 --> 02:14:44.109
SO BASICALLY WE NEED TO ADDRESS

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:45.811
THE CONCRETE RESULTS THAT WE ARE

02:14:45.877 --> 02:14:47.512

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:51.850
RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY.

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:54.219
TODAY IN CALIFORNIA THAT MEANS

02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:55.520
UNDERSTANDING THAT ALTHOUGH

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:57.355
CALIFORNIA IS PAINTED AS A

02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:58.824
BEACON FOR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM

IN THE COUNTRY.

02:14:59.791 --> 02:15:01.860
NOT EVERYONE HAS EQUAL ACCESS TO

02:15:03.762 --> 02:15:05.263
LANGUAGE IS STILL A BARRIER AS

WE HERE IN LOS ANGELES OFTEN

02:15:07.699 --> 02:15:09.167
THERE ARE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:15.540
AND THE LANGUAGE BARRIER --

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:17.242

02:15:24.683 --> 02:15:25.951
EVERYONE HAS HEALTH INSURANCE

02:15:26.017 --> 02:15:27.419
GEOGRAPHY IS SUPERIOR WHEN

02:15:27.486 --> 02:15:28.820
THEY'RE NOT SERVICES WITHIN A

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:30.155
REASONABLE -- RANGE FROM YOUR

02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:32.357

02:15:32.424 --> 02:15:33.825
AND NOT TO MENTION THE CLIMATE

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:35.060
OF FEAR AND CONFUSION THAT THE

02:15:35.126 --> 02:15:36.194
FEDERAL MINISTRATIONS

OTHER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

02:15:41.933 --> 02:15:42.901
THE ATTEMPT TO ENTITLE TEN

RESULTING IN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL

02:15:56.882 --> 02:15:58.550
HEALTH CRISES.

02:15:58.617 --> 02:16:00.485
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS CENTER THE

02:16:00.552 --> 02:16:01.419

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:11.730
IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT -- WHAT

02:16:11.796 --> 02:16:12.931
A GREAT JOB ADVOCATES IN

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:14.232

MAKING GREAT STRIDES IN

02:16:18.003 --> 02:16:19.204
INCREASING ACCESS IN THE STATE?

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:20.171
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO

02:16:20.238 --> 02:16:22.474
REALIZE THAT DOESN'T EQUATE TO

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:23.808

02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:12.857

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:16.394

02:17:23.101 --> 02:17:23.535
CHILLING EFFECT THAT WAS

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:25.236
HAPPENING ON OUR FAMILIES IN A

02:17:25.303 --> 02:17:27.038
STUDY WITH THE CHILDREN'S

02:17:27.105 --> 02:17:28.807
PARTNERSHIP IN THAT CALIFORNIA.

02:17:28.873 --> 02:17:30.308
CALIFORNIA PROGRAM ASK SAYS TO

02:17:30.375 --> 02:17:31.943
CARE WHILE BACK TO IT WAS

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.078
ACTUALLY PROVIDER SURVEY JUST TO

02:17:33.144 --> 02:17:34.746
GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT

02:17:34.813 --> 02:17:36.381
PROVIDERS REPORTED AMONG

02:17:36.448 --> 02:17:38.883
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WE SAW 90%

02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:40.885
INCREASE IN ANXIETY AND FEAR DUE

02:17:40.952 --> 02:17:42.721
TO DETENTION AND DEPORTATION.

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:45.323
70% INCREASE IN DEPRESSION

02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:47.759

02:17:47.826 --> 02:17:49.094

DIAGNOSIS 25% INCREASE IN

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:55.700
SINKING MENTAL HEALTH CARE --

62% INCREASING CONCERNS ABOUT

02:17:57.135 --> 02:17:58.570
ENROLLING IN PUBLIC BENEFIT

02:17:58.637 --> 02:18:00.338
PROGRAMS SUCH AS WEAK AND

02:18:00.405 --> 02:18:03.642
MEDICAID AND SO -- AND THIS

02:18:03.708 --> 02:18:04.743
INCLUDES WITH THE CAN FEW I'M

02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:06.277
REALLY MASS CONFUSION OF PEOPLE

02:18:06.344 --> 02:18:07.846
COMING IN WITH THE FEAR CAUSING

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:08.947
THEM TO WANT TO CANCEL

APPOINTMENTS ARE ASKED TO BE

02:18:10.181 --> 02:18:11.616
JUST ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS LIKE.

02:18:11.683 --> 02:18:13.151
MEDICARE SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS

02:18:13.218 --> 02:18:14.419
OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN

02:18:14.486 --> 02:18:16.388
THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:18:16.454 --> 02:18:18.790
DOCUMENT FROM OUR A PROVIDERS

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:19.357
AND THIS.

02:18:19.424 --> 02:18:20.892
ACTUALLY DOES PRESENT STRESS ON

02:18:20.959 --> 02:18:23.662
PROVIDERS -- BECAUSE THE

02:18:23.728 --> 02:18:28.566

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:29.567
CHARLIE YOU KNOW HAVES DRESS A

02:18:29.634 --> 02:18:30.368
CHALLENGING POPULATION IN OUR

02:18:30.435 --> 02:18:31.036
CHALLENGE WE GETTING THEM ACCESS

02:18:31.102 --> 02:18:32.003

SERVICES OVER CAPACITY IT'S

02:18:33.338 --> 02:18:33.905
ALREADY A CHALLENGING POSITION

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:34.739
TO WORK WITH THE VULNERABLE

02:18:34.806 --> 02:18:35.807
POPULATIONS.

02:18:35.874 --> 02:18:37.108
BUT WHAT WE FOUND IN TALKING TO

02:18:37.175 --> 02:18:38.443
OUR PROVIDERS ARE RESPONDING TO

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:40.145
THE SURVEY WHEN THE POPULATION

02:18:40.211 --> 02:18:42.313
IS PARTICULARLY STRESSED AT THIS

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:44.049
LEVEL AND YOU AND FOR EXAMPLE OR

02:18:44.115 --> 02:18:45.650
MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY CANNOT

02:18:45.717 --> 02:18:47.552
KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND -- THIS

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:49.754
PUTS A TREMENDOUS STRESS ON

02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:51.489
PROVIDERS SO THAT'S JUST AN

02:18:51.556 --> 02:18:52.524
ADDITIONAL THING THAT WE ARE

02:18:52.590 --> 02:18:53.591
SEEING IS ALREADY DISCUSSED THE

02:18:53.658 --> 02:18:54.926
WORK FORCE CHALLENGE THAT WE

02:18:54.993 --> 02:18:56.394
HAVE TO RECRUIT RETRAITE READ

02:18:56.461 --> 02:18:58.329
RETAIN OUR PROVIDERS AND I JUST

02:18:58.396 --> 02:18:59.030
KNOW WHEN OUR PATIENTS ARE

02:18:59.097 --> 02:19:00.699
SUFFERING -- THE PROVIDERS WHO

02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:04.035
ARE SO DEDICATED AND COMMITTED

02:19:04.102 --> 02:19:07.005
TO THEM ARE SUFFERING AS WELL.

02:19:07.072 --> 02:19:09.574
HAVE YOU -- CAN YOU SHARE MAY BE

02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:11.209
ANYONE ON THE PANEL -- THE

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:13.078
PERSONAL STORY OF THE PUBLIC

02:19:13.144 --> 02:19:15.647
CHARGE -- SITUATION AND HOW IT

02:19:15.714 --> 02:19:17.248
IMPACTED FAMILIES OR WHAT YOU'VE

02:19:17.315 --> 02:19:18.316
HEARD FROM.

02:19:18.383 --> 02:19:21.419
FROM THE CLINICS ON THE GROUND.

02:19:21.486 --> 02:19:24.022
I'M WELL I THINK DEFINITELY THE

02:19:24.089 --> 02:19:26.357
FEAR AMONG CHILDREN IS SOMETHING

02:19:26.424 --> 02:19:28.827
THAT IS SO HEARTBREAKING AND IT

02:19:28.893 --> 02:19:30.495
WAS IT WAS DISCUSSES STATISTICS

02:19:30.562 --> 02:19:32.297
ABOUT OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE IN

02:19:32.363 --> 02:19:34.666
AT PARENTS THAT ARE WHAT LEAST

02:19:34.733 --> 02:19:35.700
WHEN IMMIGRANTS VERY PROMINENT

02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:36.601
IN OUR POPULATION.

02:19:36.668 --> 02:19:37.736
I'M SO THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR

02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:39.571
AMONG CHILDREN AND THAT IS

02:19:39.637 --> 02:19:41.473
SOMETHING WE'RE HEARING -- BOTH

02:19:41.539 --> 02:19:43.074
ANECDOTALLY AND ON AND I THINK

02:19:43.141 --> 02:19:44.409
OUR SURVEY HELP TO SUPPORT THAT

02:19:44.476 --> 02:19:46.444
IDEA SO THAT IS I THINK JUST A

02:19:46.511 --> 02:19:49.647
MAJOR A MAJOR CONCERN -- AND

02:19:49.714 --> 02:19:50.315
WHEN I JUST SAY ABOUT THE MENTAL

02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:51.750
HEALTH NEEDS NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:19:51.816 --> 02:19:52.951
DRESS THEM I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:54.252
GET TO POLICY BUT THAT IS

02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:56.254
CERTAINLY A FRUSTRATION WITHIN

02:19:56.321 --> 02:19:57.388
THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS

02:19:57.455 --> 02:19:57.922
THAT.

02:19:57.989 --> 02:19:59.724
A WELL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

02:19:59.791 --> 02:20:00.759
SOMETHING WERE REQUIRED TO

02:20:00.825 --> 02:20:02.894
PROVIDE -- UNDER FEDERAL LAW

02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:04.729
THAT THERE ARE POLICIES IN PLACE

02:20:04.796 --> 02:20:06.598
THAT ARE IMPACTING OUR ABILITY

02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:07.632
TO EXPAND OUR MENTAL HEALTH

02:20:07.699 --> 02:20:09.134
SERVICES SO IN THESE SITUATIONS

02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:11.002
WITH THERE'S JUST A GROWING

02:20:11.069 --> 02:20:12.036
TREMENDOUS NEED AND YET.

02:20:12.103 --> 02:20:15.940
YEARS GETTING IN THE WAY IT'S

02:20:16.007 --> 02:20:19.244
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING.

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:20.812
CAN I ASK OF THEIR OTHER

02:20:20.879 --> 02:20:22.180
POLICIES THE YOU SEE THAT HAVE A

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:23.114
CHILLING EFFECT IN ADDITION TO

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:23.748
THE PUBLIC CHARGE ROLE WHETHER

02:20:23.815 --> 02:20:25.750
COMING FROM THE FEDERAL

02:20:25.817 --> 02:20:26.851
GOVERNMENT OR OTHERWISE THAT ARE

02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:27.385
REALLY.

02:20:27.452 --> 02:20:28.653
BETTER CREATING BARRIERS TO

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:30.688
PEOPLE ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE

02:20:30.755 --> 02:20:33.024
HEALTH TREATMENT.

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:34.025
WELL THE HOSTILITY TO THE

02:20:34.092 --> 02:20:36.427
IMMIGRANT POPULATION THAT THAT'S

02:20:36.494 --> 02:20:37.061
BEEN MENTIONED EVERYTHING FROM

02:20:37.128 --> 02:20:39.264
THE SAME FAMILY SEPARATIONS AND

02:20:39.330 --> 02:20:40.565
THE ANTI IMMIGRANT CLIMATE THE

02:20:40.632 --> 02:20:42.066
PUBLIC CHARGES JUST ANOTHER

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:44.202
LAYER ON TOP OF A MULTI YEAR

02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:45.603
ASSAULT THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE.

02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:47.605
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY ALL THESE

02:20:47.672 --> 02:20:48.940
POLICIES AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF

02:20:49.007 --> 02:20:50.308
THE CONFUSION AND WHY THERE'S

02:20:50.375 --> 02:20:51.709
THE DEED FOR EDUCATION AS WELL

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:54.078
BECAUSE THESE POLICIES ARE VERY

02:20:54.145 --> 02:20:56.781
CONFUSING TO INDIVIDUALS.

02:20:56.848 --> 02:20:58.917
RIGHT -- SO WE TALKED A LITTLE

02:20:58.983 --> 02:21:00.251
BIT ARE LASTING ABOUT

02:21:00.318 --> 02:21:00.985
TRANSPORTATION BEING -- AN

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:01.619
IMPORTANT PIECE OF MAKING SURE

02:21:01.686 --> 02:21:02.954
PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:03.855
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ARE

02:21:03.922 --> 02:21:05.890
THERE OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN

02:21:05.957 --> 02:21:09.928
DO -- TO CREATE BETTER ACCESS --

02:21:09.994 --> 02:21:10.461
BEYOND.

02:21:10.528 --> 02:21:11.896
BEING PARTNERS IN EDUCATING

02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:14.499
INFORMING ABOUT THE REALITY OF

02:21:14.566 --> 02:21:14.933
THINGS IN PROVIDING

02:21:14.999 --> 02:21:17.669
TRANSPORTATION AND SOME OF THE

02:21:17.735 --> 02:21:18.303
THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YOUR

02:21:18.369 --> 02:21:19.871
ANY THOUGHTS FOR US AND HOW WE

02:21:19.938 --> 02:21:23.608
CAN SUPPORT YOU AND DECREASING

02:21:23.675 --> 02:21:26.377
THOSE BARRIERS. ONE OF THE I DO

02:21:26.444 --> 02:21:26.945
WANT TO MENTION THE MENTAL

02:21:27.011 --> 02:21:27.579
HEALTH CARE IS BECAUSE I THINK

02:21:27.645 --> 02:21:28.646
THIS IS SO HUGE WE'RE FACING A

02:21:28.713 --> 02:21:29.247
CRISIS OF INDIVIDUALS NEEDING

02:21:29.314 --> 02:21:30.548
ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH BUT THE

02:21:30.615 --> 02:21:32.617
MAJOR PROVIDER CONSTITUENCY IN

02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:34.152
THE STATE WHICH COMMUNITY HEALTH

02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:35.887
CENTERS THAT ARE WELL POSITIONED

02:21:35.954 --> 02:21:36.754
TO PROVIDE.

02:21:36.821 --> 02:21:37.989
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND

02:21:38.056 --> 02:21:39.457
DOING IT THE WAY THE INTEGRATED

02:21:39.524 --> 02:21:41.159
INTO PRIMARY CARE WHICH EVIDENCE

02:21:41.226 --> 02:21:42.193
SHOWS IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:43.661
TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH.

02:21:43.728 --> 02:21:44.762
BUT STATE POLICIES RIGHT NOW DO

02:21:44.829 --> 02:21:46.297
NOT FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF

02:21:46.364 --> 02:21:47.332
COMMITTEE HEALTH CENTERS TO

02:21:47.398 --> 02:21:49.334
PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:50.702
WE ARE STILL NOT ABLE TO BILL

02:21:50.768 --> 02:21:51.970
FOR MARRIAGE FAMILY THERAPIST

02:21:52.036 --> 02:21:53.304
THIS IS THE MOST CULTURALLY

02:21:53.371 --> 02:21:55.406
COMPETENT DIVERSE WORKFORCE IN

02:21:55.473 --> 02:21:56.007
MENTAL HEALTH THAT EXISTS AS

02:21:56.074 --> 02:21:57.275
MARRIAGE FAMILY THERAPIST.

02:21:57.342 --> 02:21:59.344
WE ARE THE ONLY PROVIDER GROUP

02:21:59.410 --> 02:22:00.578
THAT IS UNABLE TO BILL FOR THEM.

02:22:00.645 --> 02:22:02.981
THAT IS A TRAGEDY IN STATE OF

02:22:03.047 --> 02:22:05.216
CALIFORNIA IN THIS SITUATION AND

02:22:05.283 --> 02:22:06.217
AND THE NEED FOR BILINGUAL

02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:08.152
BICULTURAL PROVIDERS THAT'S A

02:22:08.219 --> 02:22:09.354
POLICY THE COULD BE CHANGE WITH

02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:10.555
THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THAT

02:22:10.622 --> 02:22:12.257
THE STATE -- NEEDS TO SUBMIT SO

02:22:12.323 --> 02:22:13.124
WE CAN MOVE ON THAT SO THAT'S

02:22:13.191 --> 02:22:15.326
JUST A VERY CRITICAL POLICY

02:22:15.393 --> 02:22:17.829
ANOTHER IS THE ABILITY TO BILL

02:22:17.896 --> 02:22:18.897
FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN A PRIMARY

02:22:18.963 --> 02:22:22.634
CARE VISIT ON THE SAME DAY.

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:23.568
I WENT TO A CLINIC IN NAPA THIS

02:22:23.635 --> 02:22:24.469
IS A VERY LARGE FARM WORKER

02:22:24.535 --> 02:22:26.471
POPULATION A BRAND NEW CLINICS

02:22:26.537 --> 02:22:28.406
SLATED TO OPEN JUNE FIRST I WENT

02:22:28.473 --> 02:22:30.341
AT THE I WHEN AT THE END OF MAY.

02:22:30.408 --> 02:22:31.876
THEY HAD IT ALL SET UP WHERE THE

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:33.077
PRIMARY CARE.

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:34.479
OF THE THE MENTAL HEALTH ROOM

02:22:34.545 --> 02:22:36.714
WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE PRIMARY

02:22:36.781 --> 02:22:38.449
CARE A CLINICAL.

02:22:38.516 --> 02:22:39.984
SPACE HOWEVER THE CLINIC CANNOT

02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:41.920
BE REIMBURSED IF THEY IDENTIFY

02:22:41.986 --> 02:22:43.388
DEPRESSION BEHIND EGGS IDEA

02:22:43.454 --> 02:22:44.789
EVERYTHING THAT WAS MENTIONED.

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:46.090
AND WANT TO JUST HAND OFF TO A

02:22:46.157 --> 02:22:48.526
WARM HAND OFF SAME DAY HAVE THAT

02:22:48.593 --> 02:22:50.328
FAMILY THAT CHILD BE SEEN BY

02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:52.830
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER WE CANNOT.

02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:54.732
BILL FOR THAT SERVICE IF WE DO

02:22:54.799 --> 02:22:56.134
IT ON THE SAME DAY EVEN THOUGH

02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:57.702
KNOWING THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO

02:22:57.769 --> 02:22:59.470
FACILITATE ACCESS.

02:22:59.537 --> 02:23:00.638
SO LIKE I SAID THERE'S A MAJOR

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:01.773
BARRIERS AND IF THESE BEARS WERE

02:23:01.839 --> 02:23:04.042
ELIMINATED IT WOULD GREATLY

02:23:04.108 --> 02:23:05.710
ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF COMMUNITY

02:23:05.777 --> 02:23:08.012
HEALTH CENTERS WHO ARE THE RIGHT.

02:23:08.079 --> 02:23:09.781
PROVIDER TO SERVE THIS

02:23:09.847 --> 02:23:11.716
POPULATION IN THE RIGHT WAY --

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.851
AND WE'D BE ABLE TO DO MORE TO

PARTNERS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:34.352
THERE'S RESISTANCE AT THE

I I WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT WAS

02:26:58.843 --> 02:27:00.778
BETTER SAYS -- BUT I ALSO THINK

02:27:00.845 --> 02:27:02.213
IT'S IMPORTANT -- WELL WE DO

02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:03.047
HAVE -- FAMILIES THAT ARE VERY

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:03.614
CONSERVATIVE IN OUR IN OUR

02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:04.148
COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S

02:27:04.215 --> 02:27:05.483
IMPORTANT TO ALSO COMPLICATE

02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:06.984
THAT THAT SORT OF STEREOTYPE OF

02:27:07.051 --> 02:27:09.153
WHO WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:11.822
ALL THAT CONSERVATIVE IN FACT

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:12.390
YOU KNOW STUDIES SHOW THAT

02:27:12.456 --> 02:27:13.958
LATINO PARENTS WANT THEIR

02:27:14.025 --> 02:27:15.760
CHILDREN TO HAVE COME SIX THAT

02:27:15.826 --> 02:27:15.993
EQUAL.

02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:16.928
YOU KNOW OR SIMILAR RATES TO

02:27:16.994 --> 02:27:19.764
OTHER COMMUNITIES -- AND THAT --

02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:21.432
OFTENTIMES RELIGION IS NOT THE

02:27:21.499 --> 02:27:23.034
MOST IMPORTANT FACT DECIDING

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.102
FACTOR IN MAKING DECISIONS

02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:26.504
AROUND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OR

02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:28.139
THEIR REPRODUCTIVE LIFE.

02:27:28.206 --> 02:27:29.907
AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW CONTINUE

02:27:29.974 --> 02:27:31.342
TO PUT THAT FORWARD HERE IN THIS

02:27:31.409 --> 02:27:32.977
BUILDING IN THE MEDIA IN OUR

02:27:33.044 --> 02:27:34.478
COMMUNITIES IS REALLY IMPORTANT

02:27:34.545 --> 02:27:36.180
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S JUST LACK

02:27:36.247 --> 02:27:37.848
OF INFORMATION AND WANTING AND

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:38.316
NOT.

02:27:38.382 --> 02:27:39.984
FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO

02:27:40.051 --> 02:27:41.085
SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH THEIR

02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:43.154

02:27:50.361 --> 02:27:51.262
THAT CONFIDENCE AND THEY CAN

02:27:51.329 --> 02:27:52.396
SPEAK WITH THEIR KIDS AND

02:27:52.463 --> 02:27:53.431
THEY'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN THEIR

02:27:53.497 --> 02:27:54.999
