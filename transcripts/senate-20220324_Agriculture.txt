OF METAL CYCLOPROPANE WHICH IS KNOWN AS M. C. P. AND ALL REFER TO WHAT IS THAT GOING FORWARD. WHILE MCP IS SAFE TO USE ON PRODUCE AND IMPROVE STORAGE AND FOOD QUALITY IT IS NOT DEEMED ORGANIC BY CALIFORNIA STANDARDS NOT ONLY DOES THIS PRACTICE DECEIVE CONSUMERS AND PUT THE INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIA STATE ORGANIC PROGRAM RISK.

AND A HALF MILLION BOXES OF FRESH APPLES ANNUALLY ABOUT 40% OF THAT IS ORGANIC. AND THAT. IS THE GROWING SECTOR OF OUR MARKET- AT THE F. B. NINETY TWO ADDRESS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE PRESENT PROBLEM WHICH IS IN CURRENT CURRENTLY A- AFFECTING THEIR GRANT PROGRAM. THE APPLE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA ARE BEING MARKETED AS ORGANIC BUT CAN'T BE ORGANIC BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY BEING TREATED WITH SHELF LIFE PRESERVING PRODUCT THAT IS ONE OF C. P. THIS IS BEEN CREATED BY THE NATIONAL ORGANIC STANDARDS BOARD. APPLE MARKETED AS ORGANIC COMING FROM OUT OF STATE OR CURRENT DURING THE SAME TIME FRAME AS CALIFORNIA APPLES ARE IN SEASON DO THE DIFFERENCE IS THE GROWING SEASON THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT STORE APPLE. BACK IN SHIFT FOR APPLE THAT ARE STORED- DIDN'T MEET THE SAME BREAKS IN PRESSURES THAT ARE FRESH APPLES DO YOU HAVE TO BE TREATED WITH ONE AT THE PEAK. UNFORTUNATELY ONE MCP HAS NOT BEEN- IN THE PAST NOT BEEN DETECTABLE. THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION HAVE DISCOVERED A TEST THAT TEST- THAT CAN DETECT ONE MCP UP. TO NINE MONTHS AFTER THEY'VE BEEN STORAGE- WE AT THE CALVET HAPPEN ARE WORKING. WITH THE NATIONAL ORGANIC PROGRAM IN THE STATE TO CREATE A PROGRAM TO ENGAGE IN FORMAL MAKING PROCESS TO MANDATE THAT THIS TEST YOU TAKEN. BEFORE APPLE SHIPPED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SB NINETY TO AUTHORIZE THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION TO ACT AS THE EYES AND EARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA APPLE INDUSTRY INSURANCE APPLE'S MARKET. AS ORGANIC OR TRULY ORGANIC. THIS WILL SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON THE BUT WE TRY AND THEN TRYING TO SPOTLIGHT ON THE BAD ACTORS AND REPORT THEM TO THE STATE ORGANIC PROGRAM. IN THE NATIONAL ORGANIC PROGRAM. I'LL BE OUT.

CENTER TADA. MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU CENTER WHERE TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD- I HAVE JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS OUT OF CURIOSITY I DO IT TO THE SUPPORT THE BILL I DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH IT BUT- THIS IS I THINK- ASSEMBLY. IN ORDER TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTAND. ON THE ISSUE BUT- DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT. THE COMPANIES THAT ARE USING ONE IN. THE IN THE PRODUCT THERE'S SOME OF THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT FROM WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- BUT MORE OF WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC COMPANIES BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE IN WASHINGTON AS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRODUCERS AND IS QUITE LIKELY THAT THAT. OF COMING FROM AND THEY COME IN THE OFFSEASON- TO MATCH SORT OF FOR OUR CURRENT SEASON AND JUST FOR THE RECORD THIS BILL DOESN'T BAN THOSE COMPANIES FROM DOING IT IT JUST MAKES IT CLEAR HOW THEY CANNOT CAN'T WAIT. CORRECT CORRECT CORRECT- AND THE REASON WHY I ASK THIS TO HAVE A SYSTEM GOING INTERESTED COUNTERFEIT. THE HOBBIT DIFFERENCE. THAT SO- THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER WELL I HAVE AN ELECTRIC BILL UNDER AND I SURE OF COURSE. SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO YOU I WANTED TO- BUT RATE A LITTLE BIT ON AS WELL PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS. WE DON'T KNOW THAT AS- A CENTER WHERE DOES THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC ACTORS. BUT WE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE ONE AND THE P. PATH. TO DO IT NOW WE DEAL AND SO NOW WE CAN SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON THE BAD ACTORS. AND BRING IT TO THE S. P. N. N. O. P. Q. ACT AND- REINFORCEMENTS. TO THEM. THANK YOU MISTER SANDERS. ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ARNOLD JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS. THERE IS VALUE TO THE WORD ORGANIC AND THERE IS PRESTIGE TO THE WORD CALIFORNIA. AND BOTH OF THESE ARE AREAS OF INTEREST I THINK- HAVE VALUE IN NEED TO BE PROTECTED BY APPLAUD WHAT YOU'RE DOING I THINK WHEN WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT IS DEEMED- NON ORGANIC LIKE M. C. P. IS. THEN IN IT EXTENDS THE SHELF LIFE CORRECT ME IF I'M MISTAKEN MISTER SANDERS OR CENTER LAYERED THIS CAN PROLONG THE LIFE OF THE APPLE BY MONTHS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING I WAS SHOCKED THAT IT COULD THAT IT COULD PROLONG THE LIFE QUITE LIKE THAT SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SEASONAL- CROSSOVER WE'RE TALKING ROOM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STATES OF PERIOD PERIODS OF TIME WHERE THEY CAN ACCESS OUR MARKETS. IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS ORGANIC NOT BEING AND- DRIVE ALL THE BENEFITS SO I THINK WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR FARMERS IN THE IDEA OF WHAT IS ORGANIC AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE PLAYING FIELD IS LEVEL IF THEY INTEND TO USE- AND ENTER INTO ARM OUR MARKET PLACE. MY ONLY CONCERN WITH THIS AND IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL IS THAT WE ARE ALLOWING THIS TO APPLY TO ONE SPECIFIC SPECIFIC COMMODITY. M. C. P. SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED ACROSS THE BOARD AS A NON ORGANIC- SUBSTANCE SO THAT IF IT IS APPLIED TO ANY COMMODITY OR FOOD PRODUCT THAT IT DISALLOWS THAT ENTITY FROM REPRESENTING AS SUCH. SO WHETHER IT IS PAIRS OR ITS YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE IF YOU'RE USING THIS THIS THIS PRESERVATIVE TO PROLONG THE LIFE AND APPEARANCE OF THE PRODUCT. THEN YOU FORFEIT THE RIGHT TO IDENTIFY IT AS PURELY ORGANIC SO I WOULD MAKE I WOULD FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT WHICH THIS WOULD BE APPLIED MORE GENERALLY NOT. JUST SPECIFIC TO AL HOLES BUT THAT'S ABOUT FOR ANOTHER DAY I SEE. SO I APPLAUD WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TODAY- AND- CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YES AND I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BUT I'LL MAKE A QUICK COMMENT ON YOUR COMMENT. WHICH IS THAT. THIS IS WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS. ARE NON ORGANIC AND THAT PRINCIPLE IS APPLIED TO ALL CROPS SO IT'S A QUESTION OF THE OUTSIDE COURTS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES AND I WOULD SUSPECT IF I FIND OUT THAT THERE'S OTHER IMPORTANCE. OVER TIME THAT THAT ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR. EXCELLENT ACCENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK OR NOT ALL RIGHT CENTER TADO MOVED THE MOTION- ON S. B. NINE EIGHT TWO. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROACH. IT'S OKAY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. GORGEOUS I FOR JUST I HER TADO.

EIGHT TWENTY SO. REVIEW OF SCHOOL PROGRAMS BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS REVIEWED. HAD ADEQUATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT THIS BY AMERICANS- LAW ALL SIX HAD PURCHASED FOREIGN SOURCED FOOD ITEMS BUT DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION. TO JUSTIFY THE PURPOSE THAT PURCHASES AS A RESULT OF THE BUY AMERICAN LAXITY CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS PURCHASE LOWER QUALITY GOODS PRODUCED UNDER LESS STRINGENT WORKER HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. DESPITE LIVING IN THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL REGION OF THE WORLD. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS FELT THE IMPACT OVERSEAS COMPETITION COMPETITION. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SENECA FOODS A PRODUCER OF PEACH AND FRUIT COCKTAIL PRODUCTS SHIP SHUDDERED IT'S MODESTO PLANT PERMANENTLY. LAYING OFF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE FULL TIME WORKERS AND A THOUSAND SIX SEASONAL WORKERS THE COMPANY CITED IMPORT COMPETITION FROM OVERSEAS CHINA AND EUROPE AS THE REASON FOR THE PLANT CLOSURE. S.

UNLESS THE COST OF NON DOMESTIC PRODUCT IS MORE THAN 25% LOWER. THAN THE PRICE OF DOMESTIC PRODUCT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS FACING CALIFORNIA'S PEACH FARMERS IS THE INCREASING. VOLUME OF FOREIGN CANNED PEACHES ENTERING THIS COUNTRY PRIMARILY FROM CHINA AND GREECE. WHAT IS DEVASTATING TO OUR FARMERS IS THAT SOME OF THESE FOREIGN PRODUCTS. ARE PURCHASED WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN SERBIAN SCHOOL FEEDING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA IN ALL OTHER STATES.

THANK YOU AT CHER BORJAS- I I'D COUNT ME IN AS A SUPPORTER THIS BILL I'M HAPPY TO- TO MOVE IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I CERTAINLY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR WONDERFUL AT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY- BUT I DO HAVE TWO OBSERVATIONS- ONE IS- THE 25% NUMBER YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW- EXACTLY WHY THAT SHOULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER BUT- IT'S A POINT OF NOTE. IN THAT SPACE- SECONDLY- YOU KNOW WE WANT OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO. AND-E. YET IN THIS FOR THE SPACE OF ABOUT POTENTIALLY TRADE WARS BETWEEN COUNTRIES AND THAT'S- YEAH THAT'S ABOVE MY PAY GRADE MAYBE EVEN ABOUT THE PAY GRADE CALIFORNIA- BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE A CAUSE AND EFFECT- ONE ACTION CAN PRODUCE ANOTHER REACTION AND SO. I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF WANTING TO PROTECT OUR- AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. AND I HOPE THAT AS THIS- BATTERED WAS FORWARD AND AS IF IT'S ENACTED INTO LAW THAT WE WILL WATCH CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT DOESN'T HURT AND OVERALL AND OUR DESIRE TO HAVE A ROBUST AND SUCCESSFUL AGRICULTURAL. INDUSTRY AND WITH THEM AT THE TO MOVE BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. ARE I TO WOULD LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF THE- THOUGHTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. RARELY DO YOU SEE AN ITEM THAT. BRINGS TOGETHER LABOR BUSINESS AND NATIONAL SECURITY. AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE- RARE ITEMS. WHERE LABOR BENEFITS BY HAVING A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF WORK AND GOOD WORKING CONDITIONS- BUSINESS- PROSPERS BECAUSE- WE REEMPHASIZE OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE AND EXPAND. OUR OF OUR PRODUCTION CAPACITIES AND TO BRING TO THE FOREFRONT- HELD PORTENT INDUSTRIES FAR TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY PROVIDING ADMINISTRATION THROUGH BILL BACK- AMERICA. I THINK HAS APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED THAT BUYING AMERICAN IS A SOUND POLICY SO LONG AS IT'S DONE FAIRLY AND ALLOWS OTHERS TO COMPETE IN OUR MARKET PLACE JUST AS WE WISH TO COMPETE IN OTHER MARKETPLACES. I DID ASK THE CONSULTANT AND- THE AUTHORS- STAFF- TO LOOK INTO WHETHER OUT THERE IT WOULD BE ANY ISSUES WITH NAFTA- AND ANY OTHER FREE TRADE- AGREEMENT THAT WE MAY HAVE THAT COULD INTERFERE OR OVER STEP FROM AN AD FROM A STATE STANDPOINT INTO A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STANDPOINT. I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR HAS ANY COMMENTS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- THERE IS NO- PROBABLY PROBLEM WITH NAFTA OR ANY OTHER FREE TRADE OBLIGATION WE HAVE YES AND THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS REALLY COMPLIES WITH THE- WITH THE PRESIDENT'S- BY BACK AMERICA- PROGRAM IT IT'S ALIGNED WITH IT AND IT DOESN'T ON IT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IT DOES NOT- TRAMPLE ON ANY OF THAT WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION GUIDELINES OR OR ANY OF THE- OTHER TRADE- REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE. AND THERE THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S ALWAYS IMPACTS- AND THIS DOES NOT STOP THE IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS. FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IF THAT HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND QUITE FRANKLY DURING THE WINTER TIME ALMOST ALL THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THAT YOU U. P. COME FROM SOUTH AMERICA. SO IT DOESN'T STOP THAT BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT FOCUSES. TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AND SAYS IF WE'RE GOING TO BE USING THESE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FEED PEOPLE WHICH IS WHAT WE DO WITH OUR SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM FOR SCHOOL FOOD PROGRAMS. THAT THAT WE OUGHT TO BE PRIORITIZING AMERICAN MADE PRODUCTS UNLESS THE PRODUCT IS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE FOREIGN PRODUCT MORE THAN 25% SO. THAT THAT'S WHAT IT DOES AND- ACTION ARE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS NOT. WE'LL KEEP AN EYE BALL ON IT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE DATA UNDERSTANDING IT IS TRUE AND THAT WE ADDRESS THE BILL IF. NEED BE. YOU KNOW I ALL ALL THESE POLITICAL- SLOGANS I THINK I MADE A BOO BOO. I CALLED IT BUILD BACK. I INSTEAD OF BUY BACK OKAY I CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF THESE. THE MINISTER BUT- THE LOT I THINK I THINK MY- MY LAST MY LAST POINT IS THAT- THERE WILL LIKELY BE I SUSPECT SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- YOU KNOW. LAWS OF RECIPROCITY IN COMMERCE EXIST AND AS WE MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION AS I BELIEVE WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT THERE MIGHT BE- SOME FENCES OR SOME WALLS PUT UP- FOR OUR PRODUCTS MOVING ELSEWHERE SIMILARLY SITUATED BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS IS SOUND POLICY THAT WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN OUR IN OUR WORKERS ARE FARMS- IN OUR PRODUCTION CAPACITIES. THE NOTION OF BUYING- RUSSIAN CAUGHT COD- AT LONG JOHN SILVER'S AND DRINKING APPLE JUICE FROM I DON'T KNOW WHICH COUNTRY BUT PEACHES FROM CHINA- THAT ENTIRE. ALCHEMY DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT IN MY OPINIONWHEN WE HAVE IN OUR BACKYARD SO- WITH THAT BEING SAID- CENTER COVER YOUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I YES MISTER CHAIR REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY HAD THIS CONVERSATION- WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T BUY THOSE PRODUCTS AT LONG JOHN SILVER'S BUT WE'RE SAYING IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO INTO A SCHOOL CAFETERIA THAT THAT PRODUCT I TO BE AMERICAN MADE.
