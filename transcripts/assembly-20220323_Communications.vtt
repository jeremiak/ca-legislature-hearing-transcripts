00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:39.390
OF TEN LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES THE

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:41.325
COUNTY AND NUMEROUS AGENCIES

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:43.060
MOST OF WHICH ARE CARRIED LIVE.

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.528
OUR CURRENT CABLE PROVIDERS ARE

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:47.031
COMCAST AND AT&amp;T. THE MAJORITY

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:48.899
OF THOSE ARE COMCAST SINCE AT&amp;T

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:50.735

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:53.471
FOR NEW SUBSCRIBERS- AS MARK

00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:56.040
MENTIONED ARE CHANNELS FOR.

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.541
CABLE KHAIRUL ARCTIC CHANNELS

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.276
ARE GENERATED IN HIGH DEFINITION

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.445
BUT THE CABLE OPERATOR RELAYS

00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:03.214
THEM TO SUBSCRIBERS IN SANDARD

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.417
DEF. THAT'S REDUCING A SIXTEEN

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:08.019
BY NINE IMAGE TO FOUR BY THREE.

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:10.888
IT SQUEEZES EVERYTHING

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:11.422
EVERYTHING BECOMES BLURRY

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:15.192
SMALLER. AND ILLEGIBLE. IT'S

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:17.028
ALSO DEGRADED BECAUSE THAT

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:18.729
REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PIXELS BY

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:21.632
EIGHTY PERCENT. SO IT'S A HUGE

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:24.368
LOSS OF RESOLUTION- OUR NEED FOR

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:26.871
HD CARRIAGE IS QUITE SIMPLE.

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:27.805
IT'S REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.340

THINGS THOSE ARE FULL OF VISUAL

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.563
GRAPHICS THAT BECOME ILLEGIBLE.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:39:00.738
SO WE REALLY NEED HD- EQUIPMENT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SIR THERE'S

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:03.507

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:21.465
GREAT DISCUSSION WHAT YOU HEARD

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:22.800
THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGICAL

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:24.668
CHALLENGE HERE THIS IS ABOUT

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:27.037
ABILITY TO PAY SO- THE GYM IS

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:29.206
VERY CORRECT ABOUT HAVING A

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:32.142
FIBRE LINE FROM THE STUDIO TO

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:34.678
ARE HEADED BECAUSE HD CONTENT

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:37.181
TAKES THREE TIMES MORE BANDWIDTH

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:37.915
THAN STANDARD THAT DEFINITION

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.717
TELEVISION. AND THERE HAVE BEEN

00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:41.552
SOME PAID CHANNELS THAT HAVE

00:43:41.618 --> 00:43:42.886
UPGRADE BUT THEY HAVE PAID FOR

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:44.421
THEIR UPGRADE TO THE FIBER LINE

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:45.756

HEAD AND THEY HAVE PAID FOR THE

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:49.760
CHANNEL SO THIS IS AN ISSUE OF

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:51.462
DO YOU WANT TO VOTE TO GIVE AWAY

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:53.430

THE CABLE BREAKS- PAIGAH-

PACKAGE SO THAT'S WHERE PEAK OF

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:02.339
THAT THAT IS IN STATURE SINCE

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:04.308
TWO THOUSAND SIX. ANY UPGRADE TO

THE OTHER CHANNELS ARE PREMIUM

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:11.715
THERE IS AN ABILITY FOR THESE TO

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:14.218
DO THAT IT IS TO SAY PORTION OF

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:15.652
DO THEY WANT TO PAY FOR THAT OR

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:18.088
NOT- WE DO GIVE EVERY COMMUNITY

THAT'S MY RESPONSE OKAY BUT MY

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.508

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:55.772
UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION A

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.641
GOVERNMENT OR OTHERS ARE TRYING

00:52:57.707 --> 00:52:59.075
TO CONVEY IN THAT. SO YOU'RE SO

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:01.044

NEGOTIATED BY LOCAL FRANCHISE

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.862
WHICH IS NOT A WHOLE COUNTY- IT

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:21.565
CAN BE. JUST WHATEVER THAT

00:53:21.631 --> 00:53:23.967
FRANCHISE SPACES LAW CHANGED TO

CORRECT IN THAT IN THAT REGARD.

00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:37.600
THERE IS NO PROVISION HOWEVER

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.536
FROM NEGOTIATING ADDITIONAL

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:42.405
PROVISION FOR YOUR CANNOT BE YOU

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.174
CHOOSE TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENT

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.543
WITH YOUR PROVIDER YOU CAN IF

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:49.112
YOU WOULD LIKE HAVE HD YOU CAN'T

THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU FOR.

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:55.485
THE DISCUSS THEIR- HAS EVERY OF

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:56.720
THE MINIMUMS THAT WE HAVE TO

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.788
MEET AND THAT IS THAT WE MY

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.490
PROVIDE. PAID CHANNEL THE LOCAL

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:02.358
WHERE WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE IN

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:02.992
ADDITION SO THAT THAT'S A FREE

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:04.494
CHANNELS WITH A LOT OF MONEY SO

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:07.330
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE MUST GIVE

00:56:07.397 --> 00:56:08.698
THEM. 1% OF OUR GROSS RECEIPTS

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.700
TO USE FOR THE STUDIOS FOR THIS

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:12.435
PICTURE HILLS. AND WE MUST GIVE

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:13.870
THEM ANOTHER 5% OF OUR GROSS

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:16.272
RECEIPTS TO USE ANYWHERE THEY

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:18.174
WANT IN THEIR GENERAL FUND. NOW

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:19.609
THE NUMBER OF PICK UP FOR US UP

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:22.245
THERE. I JUST AND JUST THE

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:23.580
NUMBER OF PAID CHANNELS PLUS.

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:24.781
CORRECTLY DURING THE OLD LOCAL

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:27.317
FRANCHISING DAYS WHEN WE DID

00:56:27.383 --> 00:56:29.152
NEGOTIATE INDIVIDUALLY CITY BY

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.386
CITY COUNTY BY COUNTY THEY

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:32.155
NEGOTIATE THE NUMBER OF CHANNELS

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:34.057
THAT THEY WANT. SO THOSE

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.325
CHANNELS WERE GRANDFATHERED IN

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:39.963
SO IF MARIN HAD FIVE PATIENTS IN

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:41.030
TWO THOUSAND SIX THEY KEPT THOSE

00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:42.465
FIVE PATIENTS A DAY I DON'T KNOW

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:44.501
WHAT NUMBER YOU HAVE FOR MARIN

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:45.935
BUT- AS AN EXAMPLE. AND THEN

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:47.403
THERE IS A BARE MINIMUM THAT FOR

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.938
ANY NEW COMMUNITIES THAT YOU GET

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:50.874
A STATE FRANCHISE THAT YOU MUST

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.142
PROVIDE A MINIMUM- PICTURE FOR

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:54.210
THAT COMMUNITY. OKAY SITES ALL

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:55.712
ASK YOU THIS SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:58.114
YOU'RE SAYING. IS THAT DIFFICULT

00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:01.918
THE- ESTABLISH THE FLOOR BUT NOT

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:04.954
THE CEILING. CORRECT OKAY AND SO

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:07.357
. THAT BEING SAID IF A LOCAL

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:09.359
FRANCHISE A LOCAL ENTITY WANTED

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:12.862
MORE THAN WHAT DIFFICULT OFFERS

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.664
THEY COULD STILL NEGOTIATE WITH

00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:16.733
YOU ALL FOR THAT. CORRECT SO IF

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.835
IT LOCAL FRANCHISING IT IF A

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:21.871
LOCAL AGENCY- PAKE JANET WANTED

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:23.506
TO UPGRADE TO HIGH DEFINITION

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.375
TELEVISION. IT AND AGAIN THAT

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:27.177
TAKES THREE TIMES MORE BANDWIDTH

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:28.745
THAN STANDARD DEFINITION YOU

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:30.680
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A FIGHT A

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:32.182
DEDICATED FIBER LINE FROM THE

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:34.284
STUDIO TO THE HEAD AND THEN YOU

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.351
MUST UPGRADE THE EQUIPMENT AT

00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:37.120
THE HEAD AND YOU MUST HAVE HD

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:38.988
CHANNEL TO IT TO GET THAT ALL TO

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:41.024
WORK SO IT LIKE CHANNEL THREE

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:41.658
HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHEN YOU SEE

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:44.060
CHANNEL THREE. IT'S IN THE BASIC

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:45.428
TIER- IS CHANNEL THREE BUT IF

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:48.198
YOU WANT TO SEE HIGH DEFINITION

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:48.798
CHANNELS THREE PAYS FOR HIGH

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:50.200
DEFINITION TO A CHANNEL THAT

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:51.701
PARALLELS THAT CHANNEL THREE

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:53.703
IT'S LIKE GENERAL MOTORS SEVEN

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.071
HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN OR

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:56.973
SOMETHING. SO IT'S A HIGHER TIER

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.108
BUT IT THAT THAT H. D. TIER IS A

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:01.277
DIFFERENT HERE THAN THE BASIC

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:03.046
CABLE WHICH IS DIFFICULT.

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:06.216
SPECIFIES THAT WE PROVIDE THE

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:09.686
PAY CHANNELS IN STANDARD

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:11.254
DEFINITION. I'M GONNA- IF WE

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:13.189
OTHER MAY. AND THEN WE CAN BACK

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:16.292
BUT- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SUPPORT

00:58:16.359 --> 00:58:17.927
IN OPPOSITION AND DIFFERENT

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.762
OPINIONS ON THAT SO LET'S GO

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:22.298
HEAD TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA I

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:23.766
ALSO IT WAS JUST TRYING TO GET A

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:26.202
LITTLE BIT AT THE CALCULUS THAT

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:27.103
THAT BUT THE COST FACTOR

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:30.440
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SO- I HEARD

00:58:30.506 --> 00:58:32.141
OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT SIX

00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:34.544
PERCENT. OF IT YOU KNOW GROSS

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.913
PROCEEDS GOING ALREADY TO LOCAL

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.883
CHANNELS- I ALSO HEARD SOME

00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:42.252
SPECIFICITY AROUNDS- THE

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:44.420
SPECIFIC THAT THE USE OF THOSE

00:58:44.487 --> 00:58:47.257
FUNDS. I'M FOR INFRASTRUCTURE I

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:48.825
WOULD LIKE TO GET A SENSE OF THE

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:52.662
OVERALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH-

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:54.964
BEING ABLE TO CONVERT TO AN HD

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:58.001
WHICH IS. THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF

00:58:58.067 --> 00:59:01.638
THIS. MS AND THE POTENTIAL COST

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.806
BURDEN. TO THE LOCAL. WELL I

00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:07.043
MEAN I. THE IS THERE RIGHT SO

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.178
YOU'RE PRODUCING IN HD MOST OF

00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:11.214
THESE PLACES HAVE ALL THE

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:13.650
CAPACITY TO DO HD- IT IS A

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:16.786
CHOICE NOT TO PROVIDE H. D. I

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:18.121
THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GOING

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:20.690
DOWN THE WRONG ROAD TO SAY. THAT

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.293
WE SHOULD BE TREATING A PEG-

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.894
CHANNEL WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY PER

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:27.063
PROVIDES ESSENTIAL INFORMATION

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:27.664
SERVICES LIKE OPEN GOVERNMENT

00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:30.633
MEETINGS WITH AN NBC AFFILIATE.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:33.169
WHICH IS WHAT MR ROSCOE JUST AT

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.737
THAT THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:37.807
AND SO- I DO THIS IDEA THAT

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:39.642
WE'RE GOING TO BE COSTING LOTS

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:41.177
OF MONEY THEY THEY CAN'T

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:43.947
QUANTIFY THAT BAND WITH EXISTS

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:44.514
THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE TO

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.382
SUPPORT THAT THEY'RE CHOOSING

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:50.186
IN. WHEN THEY DECIDE TO. S. B.

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:51.821
O. G. AT GEOGRAPHICAL AREA TO

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:53.690
GEOGRAPHICAL AREA SUMMER

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:55.625
CHOOSING TO CONVEY IT IN HD. AND

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:57.827
OTHERS ARE DOWNGRADING THAT'S

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:58.695
ESSENTIALLY A CHOICE THAT THEY

00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.030
ARE MAKING- AND SO THIS BILL

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:04.267
SAYS WHEN YOU HAVE H. THE A BIT

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:04.901
AVAILABILITY. AND WHEN THINGS

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.903
HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN HD PLEASE

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.004
CONVEY AND H. D. SO PEOPLE CAN

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:09.272
ACTUALLY. SEE THE LOCAL

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:13.376
GOVERNMENT MEETINGS AND READ THE

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.178
THINGS THAT ARE BEING SHARED.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:18.348
YEAH AND- WE HAVE A- AND FOR I'M

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:21.250
GONNA GO AHEAD AND LET OUR NEXT

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.418
MEMBER ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID USE

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:25.154
AND ASK A QUESTION THANK YOU- I

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.322
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:28.224
WOULD WANT TO UPGRADE THAT MAKES

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.059
COMMON SENSE TO ME. BUT I GUESS

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:30.727
THAT'S WHERE I'M LOOKING AT

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.895
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.597
THEY'RE STOPPING YOU FROM THE

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:37.700
LOCAL- AGENCY TO I'M ACTUALLY

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:39.102
UPGRADE IT'S REALLY GETTING DOWN

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.737
TO WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT.

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.739
AND IF IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.573
THAT MUCH WHY CAN'T THEY USE IT

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:46.042
FROM THE 5% FRANCHISE FEE OR THE

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:48.544
ONE PERCENT- WHICH IS THE- GROSS

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:50.613
RECEIPTS RECEIPTS. BECAUSE SOME

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.915
THEY CAN DO THAT SO THAT IT'S

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.083
REALLY THE LOCALITY DECIDING DO

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.351
WE WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY TO

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:56.819
UPGRADE OR DO WE NOT OR MIKE

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.788
BEING CONFUSED HERE NO I MEAN I

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:01.257
THINK THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING-

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.493
A TRIP SERVICES RESPECTFULLY AS

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:04.961
I CAN LIKE THAT DEBATE. THAT

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.496
THEY WANT THEY WANT THE STATE

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:08.364
NOT TO. MENTION THIS BECAUSE

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.299
THEY WANT TO PICK OFF. LOCAL

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:12.402
GOVERNMENTS AND GET MONEY OUT OF

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.137
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BROADCAST

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.271
LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETINGS WHICH

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:17.607
THEY ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO DO.

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:20.643

NOT TO DO IT THE THAT THERE IS

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.019
NO REAL COST EXCEPT THE COST

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:32.388
THAT THEY WANT TO ENCOURAGE UPON

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:34.557
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:37.293

IT'S REALLY WHO WANTS TO PAY FOR

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.454
IT IS WHAT I'M SEEING HERE BUT

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.855
THERE'S NOT- THERE'S JUST NO

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:07.790
DAHLE. AMOUNTS THAT THEY'VE SAID

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.892

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.669
LOCAL NBC AFFILIATE. SO THE

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.971
TECHNOLOGY IS THERE THE BAND

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:22.572
WITH IS THERE. THEY CAN JUST

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.740

LAYING FIBER AND THEN THEY'RE

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.849

FIVE CONNECTION OR SOME KIND OF

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.928
ADEQUATE CA. THIS BY TO THE

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.430
EARLY DAYS OF PUBLIC ACCESS

OUT H. DEPROGRAMMING- I KNOW IN

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.907
THE CASE OF COMCAST WHEN THEY

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.208
DID ARE THEY REPLACED OUR CODERS

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:41.577
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.312
THAT WAS FOR THEIR BENEFIT

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.081
BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING THEIR

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:45.715
OWN NETWORK MORE EFFICIENT- I

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.316
YOU KNOW THE ENGINEER I SPOKE TO

THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOW THE-

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:51.988

OUR CASE THAT'S WHAT IT IS ONE

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:07.436
ONE OTHER QUICK OBSERVATION IS

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:09.305
THAT ARGUABLY DIFFICULT ALREADY

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.274

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.295
LIKE A NEW CONNECTION HAS TO BE

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:34.664
BUILT IF THEY CHOOSE TO UPGRADE

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.265

HAVE THAT BUSINESS TRIPS BUT

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:42.171

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:07.308
LAST YEAR. TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:09.511
CONFIDENTIALITY INFORMATION-

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:11.212
LANGUAGE WAS NICE AND TIGHT AND-

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:12.480
PIGGYBACKED ON THE EXISTING

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.582
PROCEDURES AT AT THE CQC AND SO

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:15.717
THAT WAS SOMETHING WE WORKED

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:17.419
ALSO WITH LET'S COUNCIL TO MAKE

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:19.487
SURE THAT WE DID IN A WAY. THAT

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.389
WOULD BE EFFECTIVE SO IN THE

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.158
SAME WAY THAT- ACOSTA JUST

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:23.691
ADDRESS THAT THE CURRENT

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:24.492
PRACTICES ARE IN PLACE TO

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:25.860
PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:28.496
THOSE WILL APPLY TO THIS BILL AS

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.732
WELL. AND DOES THE- UP. HOW AND-

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:32.434
TO ADD ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER OR

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.003
NOT THIS WOULD PUT US INTO- IT

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:46.014
WE CAN- CREATE A SECURITY THREAT. BUT THE PROOF'S IN THE PUDDING

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.248
IT'S THIS IS A PUBLIC REPORT

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:48.716

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.819
PUBLIC REPORT BY DISASTER BY

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:52.454
IMPACTS OVER AT THE C. THE

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.022
SPONSOR SAY NO IT'S NOT A IT'S

01:24:54.088 --> 01:24:56.224
NOT TO BE BY A MEANS THAT THE

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.859
BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC ON WHAT

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.494
WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION. TO BE

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.062
MADE AVAILABLE SO AND I GUESS

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:02.664
UNTIL WE SEE ONE OF THESE

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:03.465
REPORTS AGAIN. WHY WOULD YOU

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:04.966
WANNA PUT THAT INFORMATION OUT

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.701
THERE ABOUT THE IMPACTS- TO OUR

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:08.937
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. FOR

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.038
OTHERS TO LEARN FROM SO THIS

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:12.607
THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING BE

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:14.843
IT THE PC. HAS DISCRETION ON

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:15.643
WHAT IT BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:17.846
PROTECTED. IT'S TO WHAT THEY

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:19.981
BELIEVE AND WE OFTEN DISAGREE

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:21.649
WITH THEM ON THE RELEASE OF

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.751
CERTAIN INFORMATION TODAY. SO

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:25.887
BUT IT'S AT LEAST IT'S A VENUE

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.155
FOR EXPRESSING OUR CONCERNS BUT

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:29.858
ULTIMATELY IN THE END THE PEACE

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:31.226
YOU MAKE THAT DECISION. ASSEMBLY

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:35.497
MEMBER WEBER. THANK YOU SO IS

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:38.766
THERE- MAYBE WITH- DON'T HAVE

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:40.568
THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.470
COMMITTEE BUT IT'S STATES HERE

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:43.905
THE BILL WHAT AUTHORIZES THE

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.273
COMMISSION TO MAKE THAT

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.741
INFORMATION PUBLIC CONSISTENT

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.443
WITH THE COMMISSION'S PROCEDURES

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:52.447
SO DOES THAT NOT MEAN THAT IT

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:56.584
WOULD BE PUBLIC. IF IT UP

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:57.685
REMONSTRATING I THINK THE

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.454
PROCESS WOULD BE KIND OF BOILED

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:00.788
DOWN IS THE INFORMATION BE

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:02.290
PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION AND

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:04.526
IT WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC PURSUANT

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:07.295
TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE CPC

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:09.063
SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:09.931
THEIR PROCESS DETERMINE WHAT

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:11.733
WOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE- WITH

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:13.167
HELP FROM THE PUBLIC OKAY SO

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:15.403
THERE IS NOT A CONFIDENTIALITY

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:19.307
CLAUSE THAT WAS NEGOTIATED. YET

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:21.476
AGAIN I'M SORRY MANAGER IF YOU

01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:24.812
COULD. OKAY I GUESS OF MAYBE I

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:25.713
DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE WAS

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:26.814
LANGUAGE THAT WAS NEGOTIATED

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:27.715
WITH EIGHTEEN T. LAST YEAR WE

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:29.984
MADE SURE TO PUT IT IN THIS YEAR

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.419
WE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS THIS

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:33.288
YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THE CPC'S

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:35.189
PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER NOT

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.624
INFORMATION SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.359
BE MADE PUBLIC OR KEPT FROM THE

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:39.460
PUBLIC THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:40.662
INCLUDED IN THIS BILL SOME

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:41.596
PERMISSION FIRST GO TO THE

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.464
COMMISSION. WOULD NOT BE MADE

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:44.632
PUBLIC UNTIL THE CQC REVIEWED

01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:46.000
THE INFORMATION AND DETERMINE

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:47.602
WHETHER SOME OF IT SHOULD BE

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:49.070
WITHHELD FROM THE PUBLIC SO THAT

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:50.738
DETERMINATION THAT FILTER WILL

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:51.940
TAKE PLACE BEFORE ANY

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.809
INFORMATION IS MADE PUBLIC OKAY

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:55.343
THAT'S A CONFIDENTIALITY.

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:57.579
ANYBODY ON THE SIDE MEMBERS ANY

01:26:57.645 --> 01:27:00.615
OTHER MEMBERS. JUST A QUICK NOTE

SO JUST TO MAKE IT I KNOW WE'VE

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:03.685
GONE THROUGH THIS BUT THAT'S

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:05.920
PROBABLY BY CONCERN IS THAT-

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:07.388
THIS WOULD GO AT ULTIMATELY IT

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:09.557
COULD GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC SO IT

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:11.392
WOULD BE OPEN IN THE AIR THERE

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:12.694
AFTER YOU KNOW GOES FIRST

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:13.795
RESPONDERS AND IT GOES TO

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:15.296
LEGISLATORS BUT IT IS THERE

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:16.965
POSSIBILITY IT'S REALLY JUST

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.299
DETERMINES PEACE CAN YOU SEE

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:21.269
DECIDES THEY WANT TO PUT IT OUT

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:22.070
THERE TO THE PUBLIC CORRECT. THE

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:23.471
VERY SPECIFIC- REQUIREMENTS OF

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.672
THE COMMISSION HAS TO FOLLOW

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:27.709
PERCENT TO STATUTE- IS IT AS WAS

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:28.977
MENTIONED EARLIER THE SAME THE

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:30.678
SAME TYPE OF CONFIDENTIALITY

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:31.679
ASSESSMENT THAT WOULD BE

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.648
DETERMINED AND RISK PUBLIC

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:34.949
SAFETY RISK THAT IS USED TO

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:36.584
DETERMINE ELECTRICAL GRID AND

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:37.785
OTHER THINGS RIGHT NOW THAT THE

01:27:37.852 --> 01:27:39.287
COMMISSION USER BE THAT SAME

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:41.155
PROCESS THAT WOULD BE USED SO WE

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:42.223
FEEL FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.758
BECAUSE THOSE THINGS KIND OF

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:45.660
WORK NOW THE FOR THIS CRAP KIND

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:49.063
OF INFORMATION THAT WE THINK

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.698

OUR PUBLIC INFORMATION HAS THE

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:05.279
POTENTIAL TO BE. OUT IN THE

PUBLIC EVEN CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:10.718
WE SEE THAT ALL THE TIME. BUT

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.520
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS DOES THAT

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:14.622
MEAN WE DON'T MOVE FORWARD ON

01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:17.091
