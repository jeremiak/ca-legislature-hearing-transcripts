AS I TYPICALLY DO TO EXPLAIN THE PROCESSES THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED TO CONTINUE OUR ESSENTIAL WORK DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOR THOSE OF YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH IT AGAIN FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT BE TUNING IN FOR THE FIRST TIME. I'M GOING TO COVER THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THINGS FOR TODAY. IN RESPONSE TO COBIT NINETEEN OF THE EMERGENCY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC SENATORS AND SENATE STAFF WE MUST LIMIT NONESSENTIAL GATHERINGS AND IT HERE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING. IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND LOCAL ORDERS THE SENATE WILL BE HOLDING THIS ESSENTIAL HEARING AND WE HAVE MADE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS TO NORMAL PRACTICES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. BY CONDUCTING THE HEARING IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND OF OUR EMPLOYEES. FOR HOLDEN ARE COMMITTEE HEARING HERE AT THE CAPITOL WITH COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR GROWTH PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. WITH THE USE OF A VIDEO CONFERENCE SYSTEM COURSE THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT JUST A REMINDER TO PLEASE MUTE YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER AND THEN REMEMBERED I NEEDED WHEN YOU'RE READY TO SPEAK. R. I. T. PERSONNEL WILL PUT YOU BACK ON YOU WHEN YOU'RE DONE BUT WE'VE GOTTEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO- SO LET ME CONTINUE A LITTLE BIT WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PUBLIC. AFTER A THOSE INSTRUCTIONS TO SENATOR GROVE- TO ALLOW FOR THE PUBLIC ACCESS WE'VE ADMITTED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO THIS HEARING ROOM TO THE EXTENT THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS ALLOW. AND WE WILL BE USING A TELECONFERENCE SERVICE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO TESTIFY TODAY. FOR INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. WE HAVE A PARTICIPANT TOLL FREE NUMBER AND ACCESS CODE IT IS POSTED ON OUR COMMITTEE WEBSITE. AND IT'S GOING TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN A COUPLE OF TIMES TODAY YOU'LL SEE IT THERE NOW. TODAY'S PARTICIPANT NUMBER IS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN TWO TWO SIX EIGHT ONE SIX THREE. THE ACCESS CODE IS. FOUR FIVE FIVE TWO SIX NINE TWO. WHEN WE MOVED TO PUBLIC COMMENT A MODERATOR WILL IDENTIFY YOU INDIVIDUALLY OPEN YOUR LINE. AND AT THAT TIME YOU MAY ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE PLEASE NOTE THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO HEAR YOU CLEARLY AND TO AVOID ANY FEEDBACK. YOU MUST MUTE THE DEVICE THAT YOU WERE WATCHING THE HEARING ON PRIOR TO GIVING TESTIMONY OVER THE PHONE. IT'S IMPORTANT WE HEAR FROM YOU SO WE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR PATIENCE. I WILL MAINTAIN DECORUM DURING THE HEARING AS IS CUSTOMARY IN ANY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISRUPTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE. OUR HAVE THEIR CONNECTIONS MUTED MADE TO STREAMLINE THE HEARING PROCESS AND CONDUCT OUR HEARINGS IN AS CLOSE TO THE SAME MANNER AS IS CUSTOMARY. THERE MAY BE SOME LAG TIMES. FOR PARTICIPANTS ADJUSTING TO THE NEW ONLINE TOOLS SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. AND WE WILL TRY TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS HEARD. AND ALSO FOR OUR A COURT REPORTER I KNOW I'M GOING TO ASK ALL SPEAKERS COLLEAGUES AND WITNESSES A LIKE TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND CLEARLY. AND NOW I JUST BEFORE I GO TO ESTABLISHING A QUORUM I JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW MORE COMMENTS STAFF HAVE RECEIVED MANY CALLS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR BILL PROCESS. AND AN ALLEGED FAST TRACKING OF BILLS. SO I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE TO CLARIFY THINGS FOR THE PUBLIC HERE TODAY AND THOSE WATCHING OUR HEARING REMOTELY. THIS PAST MONDAY THE SENATE VOTED TO SUSPEND WHAT IS CALLED JOINT RULE FIFTY FIVE. AND SECTION EIGHT OF ARTICLE FOUR OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT'S THE THIRTY DAY IN PRINT RULE. TO FACILITATE BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE THE RULE SUSPENSION APPLIES TO ALL SENATE BILLS. THE RULE SUSPENSION WAS APPROVED ON A BIPARTISAN VOTE THIRTY ONE TO SIX- AND IT MIRRORS WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. GIVEN THAT THE SENATE IS OPERATING STILL UNDER CODED PROTOCOLS FOR EXAMPLE IT HELPS LIMIT THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS OPERATING AT THE SAME TIME. TO AVOID MEMBER STAFF AND PUBLIC EXPOSURE SUCH AS HAVING TO RUN BACK AND FORTH FROM MEETINGS WHICH MY COLLEAGUES CERTAINLY HAVE TO DO. THE MAJORITY OF THE BILLS THAT WILL BE INTRODUCED- FOR THE MAJORITY BILLS WILL BE INTRODUCED NEXT WEEK BEFORE THE BILL DEADLINE OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH. AND THEY HAVE TO BE REFERRED TO POLICY COMMITTEES FROM THIS COMMITTEE THE RULES COMMITTEE. WITHOUT A RULES SUSPENSION ALL BILLS MUST BE IN PRINT FOR THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THEY CAN BE HEARD. IN THE KOVIN PANDEMIC THIS LEADS TO LONG BILL HEARINGS WITH A NUMBER OF BILLS BEING HEARD IN A FEW HEARINGS DUE TO WHEN THEY WERE INTRODUCED SO. IT DOES GM UP THE PROCESS. pRECEIVED THAT MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED IT'S CLEAR. THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERAL VACCINE RELATED BILLS BEING SO CALLED FAST TRACKED. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THE TWO BILLS RELATED TO VACCINES SB EIGHT SEVENTY ONE AND SB EIGHT SIXTY SIX ARE NOT SCHEDULED TO BE REFERRED FROM THE RULES COMMITTEE THIS WEEK. I HOPE THAT THAT- CLARIFICATION IS REALLY HELPFUL TO THE PUBLIC. A BILL COULD NOT BE HEARD UNTIL THE RULES COMMITTEE REFERS IT TO A POLICY COMMITTEE. AND POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS WILL NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK OF MARCH. DUE TO FEBRUARY BEING RESERVE FOR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEARINGS. ALL COMMITTEES MUST PROPERLY NOTICE BILLS THAT WILL BE HEARD. THE SUSPENSION OF THE RULE DOES NOT CHANGED OUT SO I FELT LIKE IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN. THE CALLS WE RECEIVE TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS- AND FURTHER BEFORE ESTABLISHING A QUORUM I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT. AS I SAID EARLIER SENATOR GROVE IS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. SENATOR COM LONGER IS- CARRYING A BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. BUT I AM JOINED HERE BY MY OTHER COLLEAGUES AND WITH THAT I WILL ASK- MAN SECRETARY PLEASE CALL OUR ROLE. GROVE THEIR GROWTH PRESENT.

MY WORK WITH LABOR UNIONS AS HIGHLIGHTED AREAS WHERE WAGES DIDN'T SUPPORT WORKERS ABILITY TO RAISE FAMILIES. I MEAN FOR THE OWN LIVES I'VE HELD IS A FOCUS ON ANTI POVERTY WORK. THAT'S BECAUSE THE STATE AS PROSPEROUS AS CALIFORNIA AND IN THE NATION THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON ECONOMIC MOBILITY. NO PERSON OR FAMILY SHOULD EVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY'LL HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS OR WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS COMING FROM. THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS I FOCUSED MY PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION ON HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE I BELIEVE VERY FIRMLY AND DEEPLY ABOUT POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROVIDES ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLE PASSED OUT OF POVERTY IN THE NATION. ENSURING THAT INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH. EDUCATION AND NOT JUST DEBT. IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT I'VE SEEN HIGHER EDUCATION AS AN ANTI POVERTY STRATEGY. I BELIEVE THAT MY EXPERIENCE AND PASSION WILL HELP THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION FACILITIES MISSION EFFECTIVELY. I'M I'M VERY HONORED AND HUMBLED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AND WHEN I THINK GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR THE APPOINTMENT HI ADDITION I THINK THE COMMITTEE HERE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

OF THE PASSION AND YOUR COMMITMENT THAT YOU BRING TO THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR FRIEND THAT FOR THE CONVERSATION. AND FOR THE QUESTION TODAY- YOU KNOW THE BUREAU'S MISSION IS TO- AT THE BUREAU APPROVES PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATIONS THAT APARTMENT FOR THE SECONDARY EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THAT OPERATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A PHYSICAL PRESENCE. IN THE REGISTER INSTITUTIONS THAT AND WILL CALIFORNIANS FROM OUT OF STATE I'M IN DOING SO IT'S OUR JOB AT THE BUREAU TO MAKE SURE THAT HE INSTITUTIONS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAWS AND THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE SET BY THE LEGISLATURE AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE BUREAU. SH AND THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COMBINES OUR OUR TO OUR- AIMED AT ENSURING QUALITY POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THE PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR IS A CRITICAL ONE FOR THE STATE THERE'S MANY FIELDS- YOU KNOW OUR MANY AREAS OF OUR WORKFORCE WHERE I'M THE FRIEND OF THE SECONDARY SECTOR. PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN PREPARING- PROFESSIONALS WHETHER IT'S TRUCK DRIVERS- COSMETOLOGIST MANY DIFFERENT AREAS- AND BUT MAKING SURE THAT THAT QUALITY IS THERE IS IMPERATIVE- I AFTER OUR CONVERSATION SENATOR I THOUGHT BACK TO YOU EIGHT- AND S. SCHOOL OWNER THAT I RECENTLY HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THE ROUNDS LOTS OF DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND STRAINING THE BUREAU. AND ONE OWNER SAD- ABOUT HER STUDENTS THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE THEIR LAST GREAT HOPE. REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THE STUDENTS WERE ENDING UP AT THE SCHOOLS ARE ONES THAT HAVE TRIED OTHER EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. AND THEY THEY'VE STRUGGLED THERE- AND YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE CASE I BELIEVE THAT MANY INSTITUTIONS ARE SOMETIMES THE LAST GREAT HOPE FOR THOSE STUDENTS. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY THE WORK OF THE BUREAU IS SO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT'S THE LAST GREAT HOPE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THOSE HOPES. ARE REALISED IN NOT EXPLAIN IT. THANK YOU PER SHARE ANSWER PRESSURE YOUR PAY. LOOK FOR THIS YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MET VICE CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK MASCOT FOR YOUR ARE TO DEATH OF VERY AND STUFF THAT THERE ARE. FOR IT THAT ARE NOT OF IN THE MAINSTREAM OF AKADEMI OFF ON THAT PROVIDED OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO PURSUE WHAT MIGHT BE THEIR SKILL SET- THAT DEVELOP FIVE HEALTHY MATURE AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF SCHOOL IF I WAS ACTUALLY ON IT BECAUSE V. P. N. E. R. BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE SOME REALLY UNFORTUNATE SITUATIONS WITH. A FROM OF THE POST SECONDARY PRIVATE SCHOOL THAT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY PROVIDING OF THE PROMISED JOBS EDUCATION AND SOME SOME WENT OUT OF BUSINESS FIVE CERTAINLY I KNOW THE KOBE AD HELPED WITH THAT AFTER THE FACT THIS IS A REALLY I THINK OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. SO I AM SO VERY HAPPY THAT YOU ARE THERE WITH THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THESE ARE OPERATING AS A PROMISE THAT THEIR CHARTER IS SOMETHING THAT I IS THAT HELD AND YOU OVERSIGHT ANY OTHER COMPLAINT SO THAT COMEY. I DID WANT TO ASK DOUBTS MY SIMPLEST QUESTION NOW IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE EVEN A GREAT JOB AND THANK YOU BALLOT YOU KNOW THE MISSION AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO THAT BAD THOUGH COMPLY COMING AND I JUST INTEREST IN HAND HOW TRIAGE THOSE. AND WHAT THE TIMELINE IS FOR SOME SORT OF A RESOLUTION WE HAVE FIVE VERY COMPLAINTS THAT CHILD MIGHT COME YOUR WAY ON THE- MAYBE THE ON CREDENTIAL SUPPOSED TO BE-PROVIDED OR THE LICENSES SUPPOSED TO BE FOR A PROVIDED. WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU ALL DO IT HOW DO YOU MAKE. SURE THAT THAT FROM THE TIME WE MATTER. THANK YOU THE- I AM AT GREAT. AND THIS COMPLAINT IS A CREDIT PART OF THE BUREAU- WE HAVE AT TEAM DATA BE FILE ARE WE DROVE. WORK I STILL- WE HAVE AN INTAKE PROCESS THAT. IS SOMETHING WE CAN HEAR IT TRY WHETHER SOMETHING THAT INVEST. INTO WHAT LEVEL OF INVEST. AND BASED ON THAT. OF MICRO YOU- IN OUR COMPLAIN ARE FOR SOMEONE IN A SPECIAL. UNIT AND DEEP DIVE. IN SOME CASES- COME. OUR NEXT. THINGS THAT WE OURSELVES CAN HAND ON IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING- THAT AN ACCREDITING AGENCY. THAT APPROVES THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND IS REALLY GOOD ABOUT THE CENTER UP. FOR THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS WE HAVE A ROBUST SET OF PARTNERS THAT WE REFER TO YOU- WE ROUTINELY REFER AND COORDINATE WITH EXTERNAL ENTITIES WHETHER SISTER AGENCIES WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OR OUTSIDE. TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS COMPLAINTS ARE ARE BEING ADDRESSED- AS EFFICIENTLY AND AS THOROUGHLY AS POSSIBLE- IN TERMS OF TIMELINE WE NEED YOU RECEIVE YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT STUDENTS GET SOME. QUICK AT AND NOTIFICATION OF THE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN RECEIVED THE TIME LINES ADMITTEDLY FOR SOME COMPLAINTS CAN VERY BECAUSE THE NEED FOR INVESTIGATION CANARY BUT ME I'M- IN SOME IN SOME INVESTIGATIONS ARE QUITE IN DEPTH. AND CAN STAND FOR A WHILE I'M AS WE AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH WHAT'S NEEDED- BUT CERTAIN CERTAINLY ENSURING THAT STUDENTS ARE GETTING TIMELY UPDATES SO THAT THEY KNOW WHERE THINGS STAND AS A PRIORITY FOR US. YOU'RE FITTING OF THE WAITING IN THE WAITING TO KNOWING WHETHER THEY ARE YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE RESOLVED AND CERTAINLY IN MANY CASES TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE STUDENTS CERTAINLY. AND I GUESS THE CREDIBILITY OF THE PARTICULAR INSTRUCTION OR THE SCHOOL IF. I INVOLVED IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MISHAPS THAT HAPPEN. WITH NO INTENTION NOT TO PROVIDE WHAT WAS PROMISED OR QUALITY EDUCATION. WHICH LEADS. ME TO JUST ONE FIVE DOT YOU CHIU IT FAR ENOUGH I DID SHOW SOME. ABOUT THE ONLINE AND- IN HOW ABLE TO OVERSEE THAT THEY THINK. THEY'RE HAVE BEEN A FORTUNE. A LOT OF SKIN AND THAT. OVER OVER THE- BUT FACE SEVERAL. SO HOW DO YOU HANDLE IF THERE'S COMPLAIN ABOUT THE- OF. SCHOOL THAT MIGHT YOU KNOW CENTER MONEY AND THEN. YOU GET MAYBE A OFTEN OF A- YOU KNOW OF. TEXTBOOK AND THEN NOTHING HOW. I'M STILL- IT'S EVERY QUESTIONS AB ONE OF YOUR SPEND ROUGHLY WITH INCREASING OVER RECENT YOU KNOW I ARE SOME WAYS MORE- THERE'S VERY CLEAR SO BRICK AND MORTAR ARE GROUND AND EDUCATION IN OUR- AND- BUT OTHER VERY VERY CLEAR DIFFERENCES. SOME OF THE- YOU KNOW AND ALSO YOU KNOW COURSE WHEN COMMITTEE FIRST HIT A LOT OF INSTITUTIONS THAT WORK. WELL PREPARED TO BE ON HAD A SHIFT ON MY- ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN. IS TO FLUSH OUT MORE ARE REGULATIONS ON DISTANCE EDUCATION NO THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SENT OUT OUR RANGE OF MINIMUM OPERATING STANDARDS THAT INSTITUTIONS MUST MEET IN ORDER TO GET. YOU OPERATE WITHIN THE STATE CONTENT TO INSURE STUDENT PROTECTION AND QUALITY EDUCATION I'M AND THEN WITHIN THOSE THE BUREAU HAS PROMULGATED REGULATIONS TO BETTER DEFINE WHAT THAT MEANS SO WE CAN MONITOR OUR COMPLIANCE- WE HADN'T PREVIOUSLY DONE A TINY IN THE AREA OF DISTANCE EDUCATION- AND BUT NOW WE'RE LOOKING REALLY INTACT. WHAT WE CAN BE DOING STEPS TO. BETTER ENSURE QUALITY AND OPERATIONS FOR THE STUDENTS SOME OF THE ISSUES WERE LOOKING AT OUR- INSURING THAT FACULTY HAVE HAD SOME TRAINING IN ONLINE EDUCATION- ENSURING THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE- APPOINTMENT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION AND DISTANCE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE SCHOOL IS OFFERING TO THEM- WE RECENTLY JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO BUT FOR THAT. A SET OF DRAFT PROPOSED REGULATIONS TO- TO OUR TO STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY TO GET FEEDBACK FROM INSTITUTIONS ON WHAT THOSE. WHAT THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES MIGHT BE AND HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO STRENGTHEN. OUR REGULATIONS IN THIS AREA. IN YOU MIGHT NEED TO LEGISLATURE HELP ON ABOUT IT FOR POINT A LOT. IF THE ARE OTHER TO THAT ARE IN THE AREA MAKE SURE WE ARE AWARE OF THAT- IS THERE A- WAY. YOU ALERT ARE THE PUBLIC THAT SCHOOL ACSR YOU KNOW. WHATEVER ON THE PARTICULAR. ARE SPECIFIC UP. SCHOOL IS PROVIDING THAT'S NOT A LEGITIMATE- YOU KNOW REGISTERED CERTIFIED SCHOOL ON ONLINE OR DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITY. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PUBLIC THAT WAY THAT THAT MIGHT LEND ITSELF TO SOME SORT OF REGULATION TO ENSURE THAT FACT THEY ARE CREDIBLE AND THEY ARE LICENSED TO PERFORM- WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE PROVIDING ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE A LIST OF ALL OF OUR- INSTITUTIONS EVEN ROUGHLY THOUSAND INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE APPROVED OPERATING STATE CALIFORNIANS SHOULD WE ALSO HAVE A SEPARATE AND THE ERROR OF OUR WEBSITE. LISTS OUT THE INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT HAVE AN APPROVAL CERTAINLY WHEN INSTITUTIONS ARE OPERATING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WOULD REQUIRE APPROVAL BUT DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE FOR US AT THE BUREAU- WE HAVE AND INVESTIGATOR SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED TO WORKING FOR UNAPPROVED ACTIVITY AND THAT'S ONE OF OUR MOST COMMON SITUATIONS THAT WE ISSUE-% BUT WHEN AND WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING ANYWHERE INSTITUTIONS- INSTITUTIONS APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN TONIGHT WE DO HAVE A LIST OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS. SPECIFICALLY ON OUR WEBSITE THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO ONLINE EDUCATION- BUT IT'S A IT'S A MUCH BROADER BROADER LIST THAN THAT- BUILDING OFF OF THAT AND ALSO RELATED TO THE LAST QUESTION IN YOUR KIND OFFER TO- YOU KNOW KEEP THE LEGISLATURE ABREAST OF ISSUES THAT WE- WE ARE SEEN- ONE OF THE ISSUES. THAT THAT HAS BEEN RAISED SPEAKING AND YOU KNOW IT'S INCREASING ISSUE FOR US AT THE BUREAU IS THAT WE DO. WE DO NEED TO APPROVE INSTITUTIONS OPERATING THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE% IN CALIFORNIA- WHEN INSTITUTIONS ARE MOVING ONLINE VISIBLE PRESENCE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA YOUR SOLELY ONLINE INSTITUTION THAT'S OPERATING AND- IN OAKLAND- IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO MOVE OVER. CROSSCHECK TO RENO JUST STEP THROAT SINCE CITY NAMES- BUT THE DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCE JUST STUDENTS. MIGHT NOT BE OBVIOUS BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO PROTECT THOSE RESIDENTS IS INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT- WHEN IT WHEN IT INSTITUTION IS JUST ACROSS THE BORDER ALL THEY NEED TO DO WITH THEIR FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS REGISTERED WITH THE BUREAU AND PAY INTO A FUND THAT WE HAVE BURKE. FOR STUDENT HARM BUT THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN REALLY DO WHAT THE BUREAU- AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THE OUT OF THE SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE GREAT. WELL THANK YOU FOR THOSE WHO SPONSOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR CA. TO A REAL REALLY. TO US. SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC A SPECIAL TO THE SEEK OUT YOU KNOW AT CAREER. OF THAT THESE CAMPUS FOR THEM BUT ENSURING THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE- THEY'RE GETTING MORE THE WHAT THEY PAID FOR AND WHAT THE- FOR. PRE THAT AND YOU WILL. CERTAINLY HAVE MY SUPPORT WHEN WE COME TO YOU ARE SUPPORTING YOUR ON NOMINATION YOUR CONFIRMATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR. LET ME TURN TO SENATOR GROVE WHO'S PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. I THINK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WARNING THIS COCHRAN HOW ARE YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. AND YOU I WAS ABLE TO READ ALL THE DATA THAT YOU SUBMITTED AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT- CALLING I STIR ASK BECAUSE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THERE THAN I HAD PLANNED TO ASK YOU. BUT I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON AND ONE OF THOSE AND ASK ANOTHER FORM OF THAT QUESTION. AND CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THE BEER ASSIST STUDENTS WITH CLOSE TO SCHOOLS AND HOW STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR THE STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AND I'M HAVE A STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR THAT TUITION RECOVERY FUNDS. AND IN YOUR VIEW IF THIS IS YOU LAW. I WANTED TO SHOW STEPS IF ANY. M. V. P. P. ET. TO PREVENT FOR MISLEADING DEFRAUDING STUDENTS. THAT HAVE LOST TUITION AND I HAVE. A LOS RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY PAID FOR TUITION THAT THEY DIDN'T GET THE EDUCATION FOR. SO I'D LIKE YOU TO FOCUS ON THAT IF WE COULD FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES AND THEN BECAUSE MISTAKES ASK MY- OTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE THE ONLY ONE I HAVE- OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR I TOOK SOME NOTES BUT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REMIND ME IF I AM. IF I DON'T TAKE QUITE A HIT ON ALL OF THOSE- US AT FIRST ABOUT HOW THE BUREAU STUDENTS WITH CLOSURES- AND I KNOW THERE IS A REFERENCE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE PAST. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGH PROFILE CLOSURES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED CALIFORNIA CARIBBEAN IT'S ONE NAME. A ONE LARGE SET OF CLOSURES RIGHT WOULD WOULD BE ANOTHER ONE I'M ONE OF THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE TWO CLOSURES WAS THE CREATION OF WHAT'S CALLED THE OPPOSITE STUDENTS ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF- WE CALL THAT- STARK- INTERNALLY AND SO- STAR WAS ACTUALLY EIGHT. AM UNIT OF THE BUREAU THAT WAS CREATED IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO CLOSURES. IN ORDER TO HELP STUDENTS- HARMED BY EXPOSURE SAY THEY HAVE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS PERSPECTIVE CURRENT AND FUTURE. I'M PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION STUDENTS- BUT PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS A PLEASURE THAT'S HAPPENING- ARE- SEARCHING REALLY SWINGS SENSE YOU SWINGS INTO GEAR- WE- AS A MATTER OF OUR ROUTINE WORK FROM OPPOSING INSTITUTION WE GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THAT CLOSURE- AND THE- STAR TEAM REACHES OUT TO EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF WHAT SERVICES IT CAN PROVIDE- IT ALSO- YOU KNOW. TO THE EXTENT THAT SCHOOLS ARE OPEN AND THIS IS A POSSIBILITY WHICH OF COURSE HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE DURING THE PANDEMIC. THEY ALSO GO INTO IN PERSON WORKSHOPS TO HELP STUDENTS- YOU KNOW ONE ON ONE. AND THAT SYSTEMS MIGHT BE HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND CERTAINLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN THEM GET THE RECORDS THAT THEY NEED TO EITHER TRANSFER TO A NEW INSTITUTION OR TO SEEK FINANCIAL RELIEF. AND THEN OF COURSE HELPING THEM SECRET FINANCIAL RELIEF AS A BIG PART OF THAT BALL AS WELL- WE DO AT THE BUREAU HAVE A STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FUND WHICH IS OUR OWN. OUR OWN POT OF FUNDS THAT WE CAN USE TO HELP STUDENTS WHO FACE ECONOMIC LOSS DUE TO U. S. FORECLOSURE OR THE DECLINE IN QUALITY OR VALUE OF. EDUCATION BUT THERE'S ALSO FEDERAL. THAT'S AVAILABLE A NUMBER OF FEDERAL JUST TYPE. I'M IN HELPING THOSE GET RESEARCH. FIRST IS THAT APRIL PART OF THE- SORRY IN THAT WAY WE CAN. PROTECT OUR STRICT. AND YOU ARE STRICT BUILDING. WORK FEDERAL RELIEF- WHERE FEDERALLY DOESN'T STRETCH. I'M SO TO FILL OUT- TO ACCESS STRESSED YOU KNOW IT'S AS SIMPLE AS FILLING OUT APPLICATION THAT'S ON OUR- OR IF YOUR- SURE HOW. DO THAT A WHETHER YOU BE A CAN. FOR OUT TO OUR- OUR- STAR TEAMS DIFFERENT OUT MORE. I BELIEVE YOU FINAL WAS ABOUT WHAT IT IS STEPS THE BUREAU HAS TAKEN STEPS YOU- INSURE THAT- STUDENTS RPMS WHERE I THAT CALL ARE IN INCOME- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE A LOT OF WORK THAT'S IN WAY AT THE BUREAU- ALONG THE EFFORT WERE IN BEEN HEARING FINAL STAGE OF- A MASTER PLAN THAT WOULD REALLY WORK OR REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE CAN- RE ORIENTAL LOT OF THE BUREAU- YOU KNOW DOWN TO THAT KIND OF GRANULAR PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAXIMIZE QUALITY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AND IDENTIFY- STUDENT HARM WHERE IT MIGHT BE OCCURRING. I'M ONE OF ONE VERY IMPORTANT STEP THAT WAS TAKEN LAST YEAR BY THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO CHANGE THE LAW THAT GOVERNS THE BUREAU'S OPERATIONS DO YOU ALLOW US TO ADDRESS- STUDENT HARD BEFORE IT OCCURS SO PRIOR TO YOU- PRIOR TO LAST YEAR WHEN THE BUREAU- THE BUREAU SOUGHT ISSUES THAT WERE HAPPENING THAT WERE CLEARLY PUTTING STUDENTS AT RISK WE WERE LIMITED IN WHAT WE CAN DO AND SO WE ACTUALLY SAW THAT THE HERMIT KERR TO GET STUDENTS TO BECOME TESTIFIED ABOUT THE HARM- AND NOW WE WILL BE MUCH BETTER POSITIONED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES- AND. MITIGATE THE HARM BEFORE IT ACTUALLY. THANK YOU MUCH FOR DAHLE THIS. AND I. APPRECIATE YOU BEING WILLING TO TAKE THIS POSITION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU AND WHEN THE VOTE COMES AROUND AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HEART YOUR PASSION. AS TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FUTURE AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE WELL. THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD WENT DOWN THE PATH THAT I WAS GOING TO GO DOWN- I ONLY MAYBE HAVE ONE ADELINE QUESTION TO SORT OF FOLLOW ALONG SENATOR GROWTH WHICH IS. WELL MAYBE TO- DOES THE BUREAU CURRENTLY PARTNER WITH ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY IN THE EFFORT TO GET THE WORD OUT TO STUDENTS ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A RECOVERY FUND. I'M ABSOLUTELY THE BUREAU AND THE BUREAU THROUGHOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF THIS WORK WITH YOUR PARTNERS WITH MANY OTHER STATE AGENCIES I'M- PARTICULARLY AND IMPORTANCE WITH RESPECT TO GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT THAT SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO STUDENTS AND- OUR STUDENTS TUITION RECOVERY FIND IS OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH A CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION- A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE EXTENDED ACCESS. TO THAT FIND TO STUDENTS WHO ARE HARMED BY THAT RENDON CLOSURE WHICH HAPPENED BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING FINANCIAL RELIEF TO STUDENTS ARE HELPING STUDENTS FROM EXPOSURE. TIME IS THE ENEMY SO- BEING ABLE TO FIND THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE CLOSURE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE DEFINITELY REQUIRED PARTNERSHIP. BUT WE WORKED WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO IDENTIFY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WE THOUGHT MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHICH RECOVERY FUNDS. AND EMBARKED ON- AND INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS YOU TO REACH OUT TO THOSE STUDENTS MAKE SURE THEY WERE AWARE OF OUR OWN STAR SERVICES MORE BROADLY AND ARE STRESSED FIND AND THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR IT SPECIFICALLY. WELL THANK YOU AND YOU YOU WENT DOWN THE ROAD TO BY NEXT QUESTION SO I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED IT WHICH IS HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT UTILIZING THE FIND IT SOUNDS LIKE- THAT'S AN ONGOING EFFORT TO- TO BE AWARE OF AND GET THE WORD OUT. I'M AT. IT IS SEN WE- IT WOULD HARD TO QUANTIFY THAT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT- SO THERE'S ALWAYS MORE WORK TO DO ANY OUTREACH SIDE. AND AGAIN SET TO REFERENCE SOMETHING I MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK IT'S NOT JUST YOU ABOUT STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FIND. BUT ALSO OTHER FINANCIAL FORMS OF RELIEF WHETHER IT'S CLOSED SCHOOL DISCHARGES FROM THE FINANCIAL FROM THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR BORROWER DEFENSE DISCHARGE IS. THERE A NUMBER OF DISCHARGES- THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THOSE ARE SORT OF FIRST DOLLAR PROGRAM. THAT CAN REALLY HELP STUDENTS WITH SO MUCH- WITH ALL OF THEIR FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND THEN OUR STRICT FINES AS WE CALL IT. CAN KIND OF STAND ON TOP OF THAT SO SOME OF OUR OTHER EFFORTS. TO GET THOSE DOLLARS IN STUDENTS HAND INCLUDE REGULAR COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR LEGAL AID PARTNERS- AND WE'RE INCREASINGLY COMMUNICATING WITH THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO SEE IF THERE'S MORE COORDINATION WE MIGHT BE ABLE. TO DO WITH THEM AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR REPEATING- SOME OF SOME OF THAT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT. I NOW I'M GOING TO GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- WILL START. BEFORE- WHO. MIGHT WISH TO TESTIFY IN SO. AND WE'RE GONNA START RIGHT HERE IN ROOM THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE BUT AS I.

AND NOW DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT I MOST IDENTIFY AS A PUBLIC SERVANT AND AS A BRIDGE BUILDER. IT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED TIME FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE LONG KNOWN DETERMINE WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES AT WHAT RATES. IN WHICH ZIP CODES. THOSE IN THE STRUCTURAL AND THE SOCIAL FACTORS THAT CREATE DISPARITIES HONOR DASHBOARDS AND INEQUITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS NOTED IN THE CAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY STRATEGIC PRIORITIES. IN ORDER TO CREATE HELLO CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EQUITY IS V. CORE VALUE. WE CONSTANTLY PURSUED SOCIAL AND RACIAL JUSTICE I NOT ONLY LIFTING ALL BOATS BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE BUGS THAT NEED TO BE LIFTED MORE AND WE PRIORITIZE PREVENTION AND THE UPSTREAM FACTORS THAT IMPACT AN INDIVIDUAL'S HEALTH AND WELLBEING. MY TOP THREE PRIORITIES WILL BE ONE ADVANCING RACIAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC EQUITY RESILIENCY AND THREE BEHAVIORAL WELLNESS ALL TO SUPPORT AN EQUITABLE PANDEMIC RECOVERY AS WE ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S OVERLAPPING EXISTENTIAL THREATS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TENTH RIGHT. THIS PANDEMIC HAS REMINDED US THAT HEALTH EQUITY REQUIRES AN ALL OF GOVERNMENT ALL SECTOR ALL SOCIETY RESPONSE THEREFORE I AIM TO PURSUE THESE PRIORITIES WITH OPEN COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN OUR MANY STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS IN ADDITION TO THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. FINALLY I'M COMMITTED TO MY OFFICE'S MISSION AND VISION WHICH IS THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPTIMAL HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. I'M COMMITTED TO CREATING A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AND I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME TODAY IN RETURN THIS EQUITY MOMENT INTO AN EQUITY WITH. DR THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM GOING TO MIX IT UP A BIT AND SEE IF SENATOR GROVE WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST- PARTICIPATING REMOTELY SENATOR GROWTH. AND THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEN THANK YOU- MR A ROW HIGH DOCTOR AMENDMENT HI CAN I DON'T WANT TO MIDDLE AT YOUR FEET LAST NAME I'M SO SORRY AND SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. AND SO DR- HUNT IN YOUR WRITTEN RESPONSES THAT YOU REPLIED TO THE RULES COMMITTEE AND ALSO IN YOUR STATEMENT THAT YOU JUST OPENED YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR THREE TOP PRIORITIES BEANIE BEING CLIMATE ACTION. BEHAVIORAL WELLNESS AND REYES REAL RESILIENCY AND ADVANCING ANTI RACISM AND CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS GOING TO MEASURE THOSE GOALS AND WHAT. I KNOW THE OUTCOMES BUT WHAT'S YOUR MAJOR ABILITY HIM TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ABOUT CONSIDERING CHEATING. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION- AND IT REALLY COMES TED OUTCOME METRICS NOT JUST WORDS AND DESIRES SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE A VARIETYOF INITIATIVES ADDRESSING THOSE PRIORITIES AND OUR DIRECTOR THE MOST OUTGOING FOOD YOU CONFIRM THE LAST JUNE. IS REALLY A CHAMPION OF A MEASUREMENT STRATEGY CALLED RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S A WAY THAT WE GET UP ON EASY TO UNDERSTAND DASHBOARDS WITH COMMON HEADLINES IN INDICATORS SO WE CAN SEE THE NEEDLE MOVE. HOW MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAD AN EXTREME HEAT PLAN IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO BE HEAT RESILIENCE FOR CLIMATE ACTION. HOW MANY LOW INCOME HOMES WERE WHETHER RISE IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED FOR. WILDFIRE SEASON REGARDING SMOKE IN EXTREME HEAT. HOW MANY LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS HAVE STAFF DEDICATED TO SUPPORT CLIMATE ACTION RESILIENCY JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE PRIORITIES. IF WE'RE TO TAKE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WELLNESS AND RESILIENCY FOR EXAMPLE. IT MAY BE MOVING THE NEEDLE ON SOME OF OUR STATE WIDE INDICATORS AS PARTNERS ARE STATEWIDE PLAN. IT'S CALLED LET'S GET HEALTHY CALIFORNIA THE STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND THOSE MAY GET MORE SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF. REDUCING SUICIDE OR- IN ORDER TO LINK PEOPLE TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SOME OF THE INITIATIVES THAT MY OFFICE FUNDS. SO WE CALL THEM PROCESS OUTCOMES AND OUTCOME METRICS AND BOTH OF THEM ARE IMPORTANT TO GET THE DOLLARS IN THE RIGHT PLACES BUT ULTIMATELY TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE A METHOD THAT PURSUE. AT THE LEVEL AND WITHIN MY OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING UP- THE SUICIDE ISSUE I KNOW THERE'S ALSO DEPRESSION OUR STUDENTS WITH THE RESPONSE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD WITH KOBE NINETEEN IS CREATED A- ENTIRELY NEW- HUGE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING AND I KNOW MY PHONE RINGS OFF THE HOOK- WITH PARENTS. THAT ARE DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BECAUSE OF SCHOOL CLOSURES MASKING- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WERE FACING BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE GOVERNMENTS HAD WITH COKE AT NINETEEN. SO SINCE YOU DID BRING THAT AT AND WHAT ARE THE GAPS THAT ARE HEALTH RELATED. KARAGOUNIS HIGHLIGHTED BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WOULD NINETEEN HIGHLIGHTED LIKE WE WEREN'T PREPARED FOR OUR STUDENTS TO HAVE AN INCREASE IN SUICIDAL TENDENCIES WEREN'T PREPARED FOR STUDENTS TAPPED. INCREASE IN ISOLATION AND DEPRESSION AND YOU KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE THAT THAT FRANKLY THE GOVERNOR'S HAD TO COPE IN NINETEEN. AND DIMICK SO. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED DURING S. AND- WHAT'S- AG STRATEGY- TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THESE HUGE AND THEIR THEIR MONUMENT TEST AND I THINK AS THE STUDIES CONTINUE TO COME OUT. IT'S GOING TO BE BIGGER THAN WE EVER POSSIBLY IMAGINE. AND THESE HUGE DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE ESPECIALLY WITH OUR STUDENTS AND IF AT ALL POSSIBLE I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS. NOT ONLY THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE INCREASE IN SUICIDE AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO REACH OUR STUDENTS AND NOT ONLY OUR STUDENTS BUT OTHERS REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH. BUT ALSO- IF YOU COULD ALSO ADDRESS. YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT THIS DOESN'T CONTINUE TO ARM BECOME A BIGGER MOUNTAINS. AND THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP I'M WITH THE STUDIES THAT THAT MAY BE AN EDUCATIONAL QUESTION BUT- YOU KNOW WITH AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN THE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE ESTIMATED ON SOME STUDIES THAT THIS GENERATION HAS LOST BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EDUCATION. AND IN PERSON LEARNING AND THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH ISSUES MOVING FORWARD AND- AND CREATE. BASED ON QUESTION ONE THAT YOU ANSWERED- YOU KNOW ABOUT LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW INCOMES INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT THAT HAVE- YOU KNOW ISSUES TO CERTAIN WEATHER'S AT CLIMATE CHANGES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND MORE QUIRKS COMMUNITIES. I'M I THINK THE RESPONSE TO COPE IT IS GOING TO SHOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH A HIGHER. NUMBER OF THOSE BOARDS COMMUNITY SO WHAT'S- WHAT'S YOUR- STD PH IS. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN I GUESS. I'M TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS AND MINIMIZE AND MITIGATE THIS DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN CAUSED. THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES WHICH IS REALLY PROTECTING THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE LEADERS ARE YOU. YOU KNOW OUR FEDERAL SURGEON GENERAL DR MOORTHY WAS JUST IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN DECEMBER WITH OUR STATE SURGEON GENERAL HIGHLIGHTING THE YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. AND FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAD FORESIGHT TO OUR AGENCY AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WAS APPROVED TO LAUNCH THE CHILD AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE A LANDMARK FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR FIVE YEAR INITIATIVE ACROSS MANY DEPARTMENTS TO REALLY MODERNIZE AND REVOLUTIONIZE OUR ENTIRE USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THAT'S TO ADDRESS PRE EXISTING INEQUITIES THAT EXISTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR NATION AND OUR STATE HAVE FACED IN THE RECENT YEARS MOVING INTO THE RECOVERY PHASE AS WELL. OUR OFFICE PLAYS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT ROLE WHICH IS AROUND A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN THAT WILL LAUNCH NEXT YEAR AROUND REDUCING STIGMA TO HAVE CAMPAIGNS DESIGNED BY YOUTH FOR YOUTH THE INCREASE THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS SERVICES AND TO REALLY CHAMPION THE PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH WHICH WE CALL P. E. I. PREVENTION. AND EARLY INTERVENTION IF WE CAN REACH A TEEN WHEN THEY'RE IN THOSE VULNERABLE AGES AND STAGES EARLY WE CAN PREVENT SUBSTANCE USE WE CAN PREVENT SUICIDAL THOUGHT WE CAN EVEN CATCH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS LIKE PSYCHOSIS EARLY TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER PROBLEMS LATER ON DOWN THE LINE WHICH SOME COUNTRIES DO BETTER. AND SO THIS IS REALLY OUR OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH MANY OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN OUR AGENCY TO IMPROVE TELEHEALTH THEY'LL BE TEN THOUSAND COUNSELORS WELLNESS COACH IS HIRED TO BE EMBEDDED IN SCHOOLS SO WE SAW THIS COMING AND I'M PROUD TO BE PART OF AN AGENCY THAT WAS PROACTIVE. IN JUMPING AND- RIGHT NOW WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT DEPRESSION ANXIETY SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. SUBSTANCE USE THERE'S A ALCOHOL USE CANNOT USE THERE'S- OPIOIDS INVENTOR ALL AND MANY THREATS ON OUR STREETS AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO REALLY TAKING A BOLD ALL SOCIETY ALL OF AGENCY CROSS SECTOR INCLUDING WITH SCHOOLS INCLUDING WITH PARENTS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS. DE STIGMATIZE MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE CONDITIONS IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT THE NECESSARY WILL BE WORKING ON IN THE COMING YEARS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOU AND BEING WILLING TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE AND THEM. AND I HOPE THAT YOU ARE YOU STILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR THESE MEASURED OUT KINDS BECAUSE I THINK THAT OUR NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS LIKE YOU SAID- WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE RESPONSE THAT THE GOVERNORS HAD TO GO THERE. AND I HOPE THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT WORTH WITH THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN. A WORKS BECAUSE WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM I HAD A MASSIVE THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE- CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU A DOCTOR IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR HER WILLINGNESS TO SERVE. LET ME JUST DRIVE DOWN SPECIFICALLY MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE ADDITION TO. CENTER GROVE'S QUESTION BUT- IF YOU HAVE ALL YOUR STAFF AND YOUR TRYING TO GET TO AN OUTCOME. ON CLIMATE RESILIENCY. IT HOW HOW DO YOU GET TO ACTUAL OUTCOMES IN IT AND IT I'M A FORMER CABINET SECRETARY I DON'T ALWAYS CONSIDER PLANS TO BE OUTCOMES IT'S WHAT COMES OUT OF THE PLAN SO HOW DO YOU GET FROM. FROM SORT OF HAVING YOUR INTERNAL GOALS FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY TO CLIMATE RESILIENCY ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN OF HEAT ISLAND OR WHEREVER THERE'S AN EQUITY ISSUE FOR THAT THAT IMPORTANT QUESTION- LET ME JUST REFER BACK TO LAST WEEK WHEN YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR STERN HELD A JOINT LEGISLATION COMMITTEE. ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND I SPOKE ABOUT HE PREPAREDNESS AND ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT MY OFFICE WILL BE INVOLVED IN IN TERMS OF CLIMATE AND HEALTH SURVEILLANCE. AS WELL AS A GRANT LOCAL ASSISTANCE THAT WILL GET. IF FUNDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND TRIBES. SO REALLY DRILLING DOWN INTO METRICS IS SOMETHING THAT MY OFFICE IS AN EXPERT AND WE HAVE A SMALL BUT MIGHTY TEAM CURRENTLY AT EIGHT IN OUR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH EQUITY SECTION. AND WHAT WE DO IS REALLY SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS AND LIKE YOU SAY TURNING THOSE BIG PLANS THOSE HUNDRED PAGE PDF DOCUMENTS INTO SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MEASURED BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT CENTERS HEALTH. AND CENTERS EQUITY. SO FOR EXAMPLE AB THIRTY TWO THE SCOPING PLAN FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OR THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLAN. OR HEAT PREPAREDNESS PLAN ALL OF THESE ARE EXAMPLES WHERE MY TEAM HAS ADDED VALUE TO SHOW THE HEALTH BENEFITS AND IN PARTICULAR HOW TAKING IN EQUITY APPROACH WITH ALLOCATION FORMULAS GETTING DOWN TO PARTICULAR CENSUS TRACKS. WHERE YOU NEED TO. WHETHER RISE LOW INCOME HOMES WHERE YOU NEED TO PLANT TREES TO DECREASE THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT AND BUILD HEAT RESILIENCY- WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ON THE GROUND. TO CONNECT THE DOTS TO LOCAL RESOURCES SO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE RESILIENT THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE REALLY USE OUR DATA AND MODELING EXPERTISE WITH A FEW OF OUR TOOLS THAT- BRIEFLY MENTION. ONE IS CALLED THE CLIMATE CHANGE. AND HEALTH INDICATORS THE OWNER OF BILITY TOOL AND THAT REALLY YOU DRILL. NO MATTER WHAT THE LIABILITY LOOKING AT WHETHER IT'S HEAT OR EXTREME WEATHER OR AIR POLLUTION IT ALSO HELPS YOU LOOK AT RISK FACTORS LIKE OLDER ADULTS OR THOSE WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH FOR FARMWORKERS. AND THEN HELPS YOU ALSO LOOK FROM A RESILIENCY FRAME AT THE ADAPTIVE CAPACITY OR THE ABILITY TO HAVE COOL ROOFS OR OTHER THINGS THAT CAN PROMOTE RESILIENCY AND REALLY PINPOINT ON WHERE WE PUT OUR RESOURCES. THAT WAY WE CAN PARTNER WITH OTHER AGENCIES LIKE CAL EPA THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO DRIVE THEIR PLANS POLICIES AND REGULATIONS. TO IMPROVE HEALTH I BRIEFLY MENTION ONE MORE TOOL HEALTHY MOBILITY OPTIONS TOOL WE'VE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT-OF TRANSPORTATION. TO AS THEY STEPPED FORWARD PLANS TO GET PEOPLE TO BE MORE ACTIVE WALKING BIKING TAKING PUBLIC TRANSIT. THAT'S A WAY TO NOT ONLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT ALSO DECREASE CHRONIC DISEASE YOU CAN SAVE UP TO TEN THOUSAND LIVES PER YEAR IN CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION FORGET CALIFORNIANS FROM BEING ACTIVE FROM FORTY MINUTES PER WEEK TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES PER WEEK FOR EXAMPLE. AND HELPING GUIDE WHERE THOSE RESOURCES GO TO GET THOSE OUTCOME METRICS FROM A HEALTH STANDPOINT IS WHAT WE FOCUS ON THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WELL IN THE END LET ME FOLLOW UP BECAUSE I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF. IF I'M A PERSON. THAT LIVES IN A HEAT ISLAND AND WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS HE DIE ONCE HOW DOES THE WORK YOU DO LEAD TO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY IMPACTS THAT- IS IT. THE JR ADVISING THE AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING THE PROGRAMS AND IDENTIFYING EQUITY. OUR HOUSE SOMEBODY ON THE GROUND GOING TO ACTUALLY FEEL YEAR AFTER. YEAH THANK YOU IT'S ACTUALLY A FOLLOW UP TO SENATORS GROWTH QUESTION ABOUT METRICS AND RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY ASKS THE QUESTION IS ANYONE BETTER OFF AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT ABSOLUTELY LET'S TAKE YOUR EXAMPLE OF THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT ON PROPS EVEN IN YOUR DISTRICT AND IN COASTAL FARMWORKER AREAS AND SO AS- WE- IMPLEMENT. NUMBER ONE AND ITEM IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET CLIMATE SURVEILLANCE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE BOTH ACCURATELY AND TIMELY MEASURE WHO IS IMPACTED BY EXTREME HEAT. AS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S A BILL WHEN YOU'RE A LAG TIME AND LOOKING AT DATA FROM HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND EMERGENCY ROOM VSITS AND DATA SYSTEMS CAN KNOW. WHO MAY HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF THE URBAN HEAT AFFECT OR EXTREME HEAT OR WHO MAY HAVE DIED FROM NOT. HAVING THAT ACCURATE AND TIMELY DATA CAN THEN HELP US PREVENT. FURTHER IMPACTS OFEXTREME HEAT AND ALSO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE WE PUT RESOURCES CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND TRENDS SO AS WE WORK WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WE CAN SET TARGETS THAT AREN'T JUST. BASED ON THE 95% AVERAGE OF TEMPERATURES BUT ARE REALLY MORE TARGETED TOWARDS HUMAN HEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT AIR QUALITY INDEX YOU KNOW HOW THAT ON YOUR PHONE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THE RISK IS- JUST BY LOOKING AT THE WEATHER BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT FOR SHE FOR EXAMPLE. THE PROPOSED BUDGET ITEMS WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO BETTER DOCUMENT THE IMPACT IN REAL TIME. AND THEN BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IS TO PREVENT IT BY GETTING RESOURCES ON THE GROUND SO AGAIN AND POINTING INTO THOSE CENSUS TRACTS IN YOUR DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE MORE IMPACTED BY EXTREME HEAT. TO GET RESOURCES LIKE WEATHERIZATION COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS- PUTTING IN TREES OR OTHER COOLEY ASPECTS AND OTHER PARTNER AGENCIES WORK ON. WERE SMALL AND MIGHTY BUT WE HELP GUIDE THE RESOURCES TO THE PLACES IMPROVE THE HEALTH BENEFITS SO THE OUTCOME IS REALLY AND I MEAN. YEAR BEFORE LAST THERE'S A CITY IN MY DISTRICT SAN LUIS OBISPO IN THE CLOCKED IN. AT SOMETHING THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE ONE DAY THEY THEY WERE HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES NOT FAR FROM THE COAST. A COOLER THAN EVEN SOME OF THE HOTTER AREAS AROUND THEM. SO YOU GET A HUNDRED AND. 20 DEGREES MEASUREMENT IN YOUR DATA. WHAT DO YOU GUIDE PEOPLE TO HAVE WEATHERIZATION AND COOLING CENTERS IS THERE SOMETHING THAT. DAY YOUR TEAM DOES THAT COMES OUT OF THAT READING THAT THEN PEOPLE WILL SEE ON THE GROUND. SO THIS IS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BOTH CAL OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ON OUR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OFFICE THAT SUPPORTS LOCAL COOLING OR RESILIENCY CENTERS AND OF COURSE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- AND I GET INTO THIS HAVING SPENT TOO MANY YEARS OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAVING DEALT WITH MULTIPLE EMERGENCIES FROM POWER SHUT OFFS TO WILDFIRE SMOKE. TO EXTREME HEAT SO HAVING REAL TIME ACCURATE DATA AND IDEALLY BEING ABLE TO PREDICT IT A FEW DAYS IN ADVANCE CAN HELP YOU NOTIFY THOSE POPULATIONS AND PLACES THAT ARE AT HIGHEST RISK. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT SANOMA THOSE WHO DIED IN THE CINEMA FIRES WERE THE ELDERS AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET THE INFORMATION TO THEM IN A TIMELY ENOUGH MANNER. NOW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BEING EQUIPPED WITH ACCURATE AND TIMELY DATA AND ALSO SUPPORTING A WORK FORCE OF EQUITY LEADS OF CLIMATE LEADS AT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT CAN WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE REGENCY MANAGEMENT AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ALLOWS US TO HAVE MORE OF A PREVENTATIVE- PRE HAZARD MITIGATION TYPE RESPONSE- AND YOU BETTER CORNY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU US SENATOR CENTER COME LONGER ARE YOU STILL AT SUBCOMMITTEE IS THAT STILL GOING CHAIR WITH YOUR WITH YOUR PERMISSION LET ME GO AHEAD AND GO TO YOU SO YOU CAN GET SOME QUESTIONS IN ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH MATTER PRO TEM UM THANK YOU AGAIN DR FOR- I GUESS YOU GOT YOU HAVE TO BE HERE BUT THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST ALLOWING US TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY EARLY THIS MORNING TO CHAT- I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT- THE C. R. D. P. AND- THERE WERE. SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED FOR IT IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO STATE BUDGET- FOR PHASE TWO RIGHT OF C. R. D. P. AND WE KNOW THAT WAS TO EXTEND AND RENEW THIRTY FIVE CONTRACTS. WENT UP THERE WERE SOME THAT I ASKED YOU ABOUT THAT ARE ACTUALLY I MY DISTRICT. BUT THAT FOCUS ON BLACK MENTAL HEALTH. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE MONEY WAS EARMARKED FOR THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND WAS SUPPOSED TO GO OUT BY DECEMBER TWENTY ONE IN AS OF TODAY- YET- EIGHT SHE STILL HAS NOT DISBURSED. THOSE FUNDS SO WE JUST WANNA. GET FROM YOU AGAIN- TIMELINE STRUCTURE BECAUSE WHILE IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT. A WERE IDENTIFYING- THESE ISSUES AS A PRIORITY AND BE WE HAVE AN OFFICE- LIKE YOURS. THAT IS WORKING WITH STRATEGY AND SUPPORT- AND ANALYTICS AND DATA TO HELP COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS DOING THIS WORK. IT DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY IF THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY. SO JUST WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON. YOU KNOW YOUR TIME LINES AND HOW WE CAN WORK HOW YOU ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE GETTING OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING THE WORK AND HAVE APPLIED AND BEEN APPROVED TO DO THE WORK- THANK YOU SENATOR COME UNDER FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING AND FOR THAT FOLLOW UP QUESTION. ALLOW ME TO GIVE UP A MOMENT OF BACKGROUND ON THESE MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES AND THEN ANSWER YOUR DETAILED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OPERATIONS. SO FIRST I WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND MEMBERS OF THE C. R. D. P. THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT WHICH AS YOU MENTIONED IS IN PHASE TWO. THAT'S BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY SIX SO REALLY A LONGITUDINAL INNOVATIVE PILOT PROJECT TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF WHAT WE CALL COMMUNITY DEFINED EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES FOR AGAIN PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION. FOR MENTAL WELLNESS- THEY REALLY CHAMPION CULTURE AS HEALTH AND IT'S VERY CUTTING EDGE. SO THIS WAS EXTENDED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE AS YOU MENTIONED FOR SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS- AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE C. MAP. THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH EQUITY PROJECT WHICH WAS A ONE YEAR EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR EFFORT IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE pTRYING TO BRIDGE THESE INNOVATIVE CBO PROJECTS WITH THE LOCAL COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. TO ALLOW FOR BETTER COLLABORATION WITH THE MEDIC CAL CONTRACTING PROCESS SO WE'RE PROUD OF ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON SOME OF THE OPERATIONS. SO INDEED THOSE CONTRACTS WERE EXECUTED AS OF JUNE I'M IN COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL MONTHS OF DELAYS AS YOU MENTIONED. THAT'S DUE TO A FEW REASONS THERE WAS IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE CBO'S THEMSELVES AS WELL AS ON OUR STAFF. REPORTING THE WAY STAFFING SHORTAGES. AND DUE TO THAT WE DID EXECUTE AND NO COST SIX MONTH EXTENSION FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL THAT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT NEEDED ADDITIONAL TIME TO COMPLETE THEIR DELIVERABLES SO HAS THEIR DELIVERABLES ARE COMPLETED. IN THE RECORDING IS SUBMITTED. WE HANDLE THE ARREARS AND THEN. DO THE REIMBURSEMENT- AND THAT PROCESS HAS IN. AND SET TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL FOR THE TWO THAT YOU MENTIONED WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT- TWO IN THE SOUTH LOS ANGELES AREA OUR- FIRST THE CALIFORNIA BLACK WOMEN'S HEALTH PROJECT. THIS IS SISTERS MENTALLY MOBILIZED WHICH IS REALLY A STATE WIDE MOVEMENT TO SUPPORT BLACK WOMEN IN THEIR COMMUNITY THROUGH HEALTH FOCUSED SISTER CIRCLES. AND THEN A SECOND VERY INNOVATIVE ONE THROUGH WHOLE SYSTEMS LEARNING CALLED TRYING TO T. R. I. B. E. THAT STANDS FOR. TURNING RESILIENCE INTO BRILLIANCE FOR ETERNITY. AND THAT REALLY FUNDS THE ARTS EVEN THROUGH HIP HOP FOR YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES. AND SO WE ARE COMMITTED THIS YEAR TO PUTTING UP ON OUR WEBSITE- AS YOU SUGGESTED KIND OF A TIME LINE DASHBOARD AND WE'LL GET THAT UP LATER THIS YEAR. BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO AMEND THE EXISTING GRAND STAFF ENSURE- NO INTERRUPTION OF MENTIONED NOT TO JUST GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR BUT TO ALSO CULTIVATE SOME OF THE SMALLER INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO THEY CAN BE COMPETITIVE. FOR OTHER GRANTS AND MANY OF THEM ARE WORKING WITH THE STATE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE WANT TO SUPPORT THEM TO BE COMPETITIVE AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL. LONGER TERM- BUT THIS ALSO AFFECTS THE VIOS IN OTHER DISTRICTS- AND SENATOR ATKINS DISTRICT THERE'S THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HEALTH CENTER IN SAN DIEGO SENATOR LETTER TO DISTRICT WE FOUND THE VILLAGE PROJECT. AND SENATOR GROWS DISTRICT IS THE CENTER FOR SEXUALITY AND GENDER DIVERSITY SO FIVE. PARTICULAR POPULATIONS BLACK TRIBAL ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LATINO AND LGBTQ SPREAD ACROSS THE DIVERSE STATE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TAPPED NOT ONLY SUPPORTING THE SERVICES BUT ALSO EVALUATING THEM TO SHOW THE IMPACTS THAT CAN. REALLY BE A DEMONSTRATION FOR THE NATION. THE GREAT ARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MY DISTRICT SO I'M GLAD YOU DID IT FOR ME- BUT- I ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE A- YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH IS GOING TO BE THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC THAT WE FACE THIS YEAR AND BE IF WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE IT IT MAKES. SENSE FOR US TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE AS RESPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I HAD HAD TO DO WITH THIS ARTICLE THAT WAS IN THE L. A. TIMES LAST YEAR THAT TALKED ABOUT THE AMPUTATIONS DISPARITY. AND IT WAS INDEED A SOBERING ARTICLE AND I KNOW IT IS NOT. YOUR OFFICE'S ROLE TO FIX OR YOU KNOW TO TREAT AMPUTEES ARE AND TO PREVENT. AMPUTATIONS PHYSICALLY FROM HAPPENING BUT YOU DO HAVE A LARGE ROLE TO PLAY WITH REGARDS TO COLLECTING DATA AND OFFERING STRATEGIC SUPPORT CENTER YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT- SEPARATE BUT UNEQUAL CARE THAT WE READ ABOUT IN THAT ARTICLE IN SOUTH LA JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE RECORD ABOUT EIGHTY ARTICLE IN BE WHAT WE CAN BE DOING BETTER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR- ELDERS AREN'T WALKING AROUND GETTING THEIR DIGITS CUT OFF BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO FRESH FOOD AND FRESH WATER IN PREVENTATIVE CARE. YEAH THANK YOU CENTER COME LONGER FOR RAISING THAT SOBERING ARTICLE AND SAD REALITY OF DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITY YOU KNOW AS AS A FAMILY MEDICAL PROVIDER IN MY TRAINING I'VE- TRIED THAT CONDUCT. IMPUTATIONS OF TOES AND FEET AND BELOW THE KNEES AND IT TAKES A DISPROPORTIONATE TOLL ON THOSE WHO ARE LATE TO CARE. ON THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE ESSENTIALS IN ORDER TO STAY HEALTHY. SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR SOMEONE WITH DIABETES- I REMEMBER A PATIENT OF MINE WHERE THERE CARE WASN'T GETTING BETTER THEIR AVERAGE SUGAR THE A. ONE C. WAS AN IMPROVING. AND THROUGH BUILDING TRUST WITH THIS PERSON AND REALIZING THAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO REFRIGERATE THEIR INSULIN. OR THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO STORE FRESH FRUIT OR VEGETABLES AND WITH THEIR LIMITED INCOME THEY WERE SHOPPING AT THE DOLLAR STORE AND THAT MEANT A LOT OF CARDS. AND SO IN TOOL WE ADDRESS THE UPSTREAM SOCIAL FACTORS THAT AGAIN DETERMINE WHO GET CHRONIC DISEASE. WHO CAN'T HAVE ADEQUATE NUTRITION OR EVEN ACCESS TO LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS LIKE INSULIN IN THE SAFE WAY. LET ALONE ACCESS CARE EARLY ON- WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO SO WE PARTNER WITH THE PARCHMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THROUGH THEIR CALTRAIN INITIATIVE. AND DRIVING MORE OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM MORE UPSTREAM I'M MORE TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY IN TOWARDS THE HOME ENVIRONMENT. AND AS YOU MENTIONED WHAT MY TEAM DOES THROUGH MAPPING THROUGH DATA IS TO SHOW THE DISPROPORTIONAL IDEAS AND WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS. BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE UPSTREAM ROOT CAUSES INCLUDING DISCRIMINATION IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR KNOWING THAT NOT ALL COMMUNITIES GET THE BALL CARE. AND IF YOU'RE LATINO WHEN YOU SHOW UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM YOU MAY NOT GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF ANASTASIA IF YOU'RE BLACK AND YOU SHOW UP YOU MAY NOT GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF. PAIN MEDICATION I'M MORE THE SAME ACCESS TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AND TREATMENTS LIKE CARDIAC CATHETERS NATION FOR HEART ATTACKS. AND SO DRESSING DISK. AS WELL AS THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE CONDITIONS. IS ONE WAY THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN DECREASE THAT DISPROPORTIONATE ALREADY OF A VERY DOWNSTREAM ISSUE WHY CAN'T BE PATIENTS FROM A CHRONIC DISEASE LIKE DIABETES. AND REALLY BY FUNDING PREVENTION AND FUNDING THE UPSTREAM. I HOPE WILL MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING. THREE PENNIES N THE DOLLAR IS SPENT ON PREVENTION AND NINETY SEVEN CENTS ON TREATMENT. AND THAT'S WHY IT IS LATE AND SO COSTLY WITH THE SURGERY LIKE AN AMPUTATION. IF YOU LOOK AT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOW WE BECOME THE SECOND BEST STATE IN THE NATION AT REDUCING SMOKING. IT'S MUCH CHEAPER TO PAY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS FOR TOBACCO CONTROL. AND TO PAY FOR LONG SURGERY YOU'RE A CHRONIC DISEASE SO- THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT THAT SOBERING ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES. WELL THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE TIME TO DO SO AND I APPRECIATE- WHAT YOU'VE SHARED AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ARM MAN VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU DR I THINK MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT. INTO MY MIND IF I READ THE CONDITION IN THE ORIGINAL INTERVIEWS WITH PROBABLY BEEN ASKED BUT I HAVE ONE THAT MIGHT BE KIND OF OFF THE WALL BECAUSE IT'S BOTHERED ME A LOT TO TALKING WITH PARENTS WHO OFF THEIR CHILDREN. OF THROUGH DRUG USE- ADDICTION. AND IT SEEMED TO ME GOING BACK TO THE QUESTION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE. ACROSS I'D SAY ALL ETHNICITIES IF THE LOSS OF HOPE THAT'S MAKING PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE HEADED TO THE DYSTOPIAN ENVIRONMENT- CULTURE YOU NAME IT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES. IF THAT'S THE NARRATIVE THAT COMES OUT OF OUR DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH- YOU KNOW THESE CLIMATE SUMMIT. IT'S REALLY SETTING THE TONE WITH THE YOUNGER GENERATION THAT I MIGHT AS WELL YOU KNOW JUST LET IT ALL GO IN AND GET INVOLVED WITH DRUGS SUCH FOR A HAPPY DAY TODAY- PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT AND IT'S GETTING ON IT'S VERY TROUBLING BECAUSE I HEAR FROM THE PARENTS I DEAL WITH. THE THOUGHT OF BASICALLY WHERE THEIR CHILD GOT OBVIOUSLY BULLYING AND IN SCHOOLS OF HEALTH KERR FROM OF THAT. THAT WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO GET A MORE POSITIVE NARRATIVE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THIS MONEY. ALL OF THESE AGENCIES. ALL OF THESE EXPERTS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT MAY HAPPEN. BUT WE'RE COMMITTED OUR LIFE LIKE YOU ARE TO MAKING SURE THAT WE FIND A DIFFERENT PASS. SOMEHOW WE HAVE GOT TO GET THAT OUT TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND TO THE PARENTS WHO'VE SEEN THEIR KIDS AND BEEN UNABLE UNABLE TO TURN. ARE THERE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE IT'S ALL KIND OF UNDERCOVER WAY IT'S BECOMING A FIRM CULTURE IF YOU WILL THAT WILL YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT HE DRINK AND EAT DRINK AND BE MERRY BECAUSE TOMORROW YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. AND IT SOME OF IT STARTS THAT WAY THAT THE HOPELESSNESS IS VERY TROUBLING TO ME ARE THERE WAS A SUICIDE IN MY OWN FAMILY THAT TOOK BOTH THEIR LIFE AND- THEIR WIFE LIKE IT KILLED MY SISTER. DOWN TO KILO MIKE BECAUSE HE WAS HOPELESS. SO WHAT IS HAPPENING. ON THAT FRONT. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES SON FIRST SO SORRY FOR THE LOSS IN YOUR FAMILY FROM SUICIDE IN THIS HOPELESSNESS AND IT'S- SOMETHING THAT'S- ALSO AFFECTED MY COMMUNITY AND MANY. AND I THINK YOU NAILED IT WHICH IS THAT WE NEED TO PROJECT AND NARRATIVE OF HOPE. AND POSSIBILITY AND I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MORE THAN MANY WITH YOUR BACKGROUND AS A FRONT LINE SOCIAL WORKER. AND SO I WANT TO SHARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES WHICH IS THAT RISK FACTORS AREN'T PREDICTIVE FACTORS BECAUSE OF PROTECTIVE FACTORS. AND THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS NOT ON THE RISK FACTORS AND THE DISPARITIES AND THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. NOT ON THE PREDICTIVE FACTORS BUT ON THE PROTECTIVE FACTORS THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW CREATE RESILIENCY CREATE HOPE CREATE A SENSE OF TOMORROW. I'M FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF OUR SURGEON GENERAL NOT JUST NAMING THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OUR COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES. BUT AS THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT POINTED OUT A ROAD MAP TOWARDS RESILIENCY WITH NO COST OR VERY EASILY ACCESSIBLE WAYS. THE PROVIDE SERVICES TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW BEFORE ENDEMIC DURING INCOMING OUT OF THAT. AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS RESILIENCY FRAME IS SO IMPORTANT AND FOCUSING ON THE POSITIVE FACTORS AND NOT JUST THE NEGATIVE FACTORS. THAT'S WHY MY OFFICE IS MISSION STARTS WITH OPTIMAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FOR ALL THAT IS THE VISION AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PROJECT. AND I THINK IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS- NARRATIVES IS SO IMPORTANT THAT SENSE OF HOPE AND POSSIBILITY CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PERSON MAKING A CHOICE. AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S RUSSIAN ROULETTE EXPERIMENTING WITH SOMETHING ON THE STREETS NOW COULD HAVE FENTANYL IT HAS MUCH MORE DEADLY OR CONSEQUENCE. HIGHER HERE SO WE HAVE TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM EVEN GETTING TO THAT POINT.
