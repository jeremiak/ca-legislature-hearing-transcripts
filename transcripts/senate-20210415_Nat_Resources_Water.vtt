THE YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE THIS

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:47.226
HAS BEEN KIND OF A CONSTANT

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:50.429
THEME. IT'S KIND OF A CONSTANT

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:52.665
BATTLE HAVING TO- FIGHT EVERY

YEAR FOR EQUITY AND UNDERSERVED

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:57.103
COMMUNITIES AND I JUST THOUGHT.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.704
THAT I'D SAVE EVERYONE A LOT OF

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.840
TROUBLE AT WORK ON A POLICY

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:03.009
THAT WILL REALLY GO ACROSS-

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.644
MANY DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF OUR

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.545
SOCIETY AND WORK AT CREATING

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:08.514
EQUITY. AS SOMEBODY THAT WAS

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.683
RAISED IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA I

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.084
HAVE ALL THE BUT BUMPS AND

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.753
SCARS ON MY HEAD TO PROVE THAT

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:15.721
YOU KNOW MOST OF THE TIME. YOU

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.356
KNOW IT WAS VERY HARD TO ACCESS

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:18.524
TO PARKING IF WE DID THEY WERE

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.794
USUALLY SMALL PARKS INADEQUATE

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.963
FOR SPORT SPORTING ACTIVITIES-

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.264
WE MOSTLY PLAYED IN THE STREET

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.699
IN THE ASPHALT IN THE SIDEWALK

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:30.903
AND- I CAN'T. BEGIN TO DESCRIBE

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.306
ALL THE INJURIES I SUSTAINED

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:34.674
AND ALL THE KIDS OF MINOR

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.075
NEIGHBORHOOD SUSTAIN PLAYED

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.810
TACKLE FOR FOOTBALL AN ASPHALT

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:39.312
AND SOCCER THAN IF YOU CAN

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:41.647
IMAGINE. AND THAT CONTINUES TO

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:44.483
HAPPEN ACROSS OUR STATE IN

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.084
DIFFERENT PARTS OF SOCIETY WE

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:47.286
HAVE. PEOPLE RECREATION AND

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:51.657
DANGEROUS- THE STREETS AND IN-

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.926
AREAS- WITH LOTS LOTS OF

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:56.295
TRAFFIC AND MANY IN MANY CASES

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:58.431
ARE OUR POCKET PARKS IF THAT'S

00:09:58.497 --> 00:09:59.899
ALL THEY HAVE ARE ARE NOT

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:02.635
REALLY SUITABLE. FOR CERTAIN

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:04.537
SPORTING ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:05.571
WORKED OVER THE YEARS AND

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:06.772
MAKING OUR OUR COASTLINE MARC

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:10.209
SENSIBLE. ON MAKING OF PARKS

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.845
MORE ACCESSIBLE SO THIS BILL

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:16.382
WOULD- BUT WORK ON PROMOTING

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.084
EQUITY AND ENSURING ACCESS TO

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.386
THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.922
AND IT'S BEEN A TOP PRIORITY OF

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:24.523
THIS LEGISLATURE AT LEAST FOR

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.624
THE LAST TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:27.493
HERE BUT- AND WITH THERE HAS

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.995
BEEN OTHER LEGISLATION THAT

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:30.629
DEALS WITH WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:31.897
OF THAT AND WE THOUGHT WE FILL

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.000
IN A LOT OF THE BLANKS OF.

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.402
PRIOR LEGISLATION SO. IN THE

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.670
PAST FEW YEARS STATE AGENCIES

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:39.772
HAVE TAKEN LARGE STRIDES IN

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.640
DEVELOPING AND DEDICATING.

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:44.210

THE COVERT. THE IMPACTS OF

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:00.726
COVERT AND THE STAY AT HOME

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.528
ORDER HAVE REALLY MAGNIFIED

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:04.030

WAS MUCH HARDER TO ACCESS THESE

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:14.340

EVIDENCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:33.496
HAS FAILED TO CONDUCT

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:34.464
SUFFICIENT STUDY OF THIS

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.800

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:38.301
STATE RESOURCE THE PARK WAS

PURCHASED FOR THE BENEFIT OF

THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:54.017
CENTER VIOLENCE I THINK THAT IT

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.852
SHOWS A MISUNDERSTANDING ON THE

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:56.986
PART OF THE EXECUTIVE IS STILL

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:58.354
WHAT. WE'RE PROPOSING ARE

00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:00.256
PROPOSING THAT IT BE A STATE

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:01.925
PARK THAT IT BE A PUBLIC. A

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:03.526
PRESERVATION AREA AND I THINK

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.261
THAT WAS INTO. CLEARLY

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:08.364

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:16.539
IS WAS THAT A NEW REQUIREMENT

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:18.374
THAT IT GOES TO A NONPROFIT. I

00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:20.110
THINK WHAT WE HAVE ADDED INTO

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:24.280
THIS BILL IS A- AN ACTUAL

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:27.984
PAYMENT. FOR CONSERVATION OF IT

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.352
SO THAT IT BE ALLOWED TO BE PUT

PUBLIC PRESERVATION. ONE OF THE

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:56.446
CONCERNS I HAVE IS- I DIDN'T

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:49.893
NEW PLACE TO RECTORY- THIS IS

00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:51.628
ALREADY ON THE BOOKS TO BE. AN

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:54.497
OFF ROAD PARK- BACK TO THE

00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:56.032
CONSERVATION NO. YOU KNOW I

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.967
THINK ONE OF THE CROWN JEWELS

00:58:58.034 --> 00:59:00.503
OF THE CALIFORNIA PARK SYSTEM

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.006
ARE THESE S. VRES- BECAUSE WE

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:05.708
FILE WE- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:07.143
THE OPERA COMMUNITY FOR A LONG

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.345
TIME AND I REMEMBER. YOU KNOW

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.780
THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN A LOT OF

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:12.115
THESE WERE BEING PROPOSED THERE

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:14.017
WAS A LOT OF RESISTANCE FROM

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.919
THE OFF ROADERS BECAUSE- IT YOU

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:20.123
KNOW- THEY WERE BEING YOU KNOW

00:59:20.189 --> 00:59:21.090
FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:23.293
CRAWLED INTO A SMALLER LOCATION

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.193
AND- THEY WERE REALLY CONCERNED

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.162
THAT. AND THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:28.197
ARE CONCERNED THAT. WE WERE

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.365
GOING TO THE PLACES THAT WERE

00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:30.600
BEING RESERVED FOR OFF ROAD USE

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.435
WE'RE GOING TO BE DESTROYED.

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:33.603
BECAUSE OF THE INTENSITY OF THE

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:35.438
USE. AND I THINK THAT WAS A

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:36.639
LEGITIMATE CONCERN AT THE TIME

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:38.942
BUT I THINK WE'VE PROVEN OVER

00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:40.743
THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. OF

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.045
THE OPERA COMMUNITY WORKING

00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:43.613
TOGETHER WITH PARKS AND THE

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.382
CONSERVATION GROUPS. THAT IT IS

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:49.285
POSSIBLE TO. HAVE THIS OFF

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:51.387
HIGHWAY AND I'LL ADMIT INSTANCE

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:56.059
USE. BUT THE WAY THAT. THE YOU

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:58.361
THE PEOPLE USING THE PROPERTY

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:58.895
ARE WORKING WITH THE LAND

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.064
MANAGERS TO. MAINTAINING

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.932
CONTROL THE TRAILS AND PUT THEM

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.068
IN SPECIFIC AREAS AND AVOID.

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.369
THE NATIONAL RESOURCES AND ALSO

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.338
THE SPEAKER WHEN YOU'RE

AMERICAN RESOURCES THAT ARE

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:14.911

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:18.281

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:22.979
PROCEDURAL ISSUE WHICH IS SAID

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.280
IF THIS IS GOING TO BE

ISSUE- THE BILL THAT DIED- THAT

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:44.707
NOT EVEN THE ELEVENTH HOUR BUT

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.409
THE ELEVENTH AND A HALF HOUR OF

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:49.445
SESSION. LAST YEAR BUT WE'VE

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.380
REALLY REFINED OUR APPROACH

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.848
LAST YEAR WE WERE WE WERE

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:55.818
SIGNIFICANTLY CONCERNED ABOUT-

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.787
THE RISKS IN WILDLIFE

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:00.389
TRAFFICKING- BOTH IN LIVE

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:02.325
ANIMALS AS WELL AS IN TROPHIES

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:06.262
IN ANIMAL PARTS- NOT JUST FOR-

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:07.396
SOME OF THE BLACK MARKET

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.698
ACTIVITY IS GOING ON OUT THERE

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.734
BUT MOSTLY ABOUT THE RISK IS

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.370
NOT A DISEASE. SPREAD IN LIGHT

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:15.338
OF SOME OF THE FINDINGS WE'VE

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:19.008
DISCOVERED FOR COVIDIEN- PAST.

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:21.444
FLUS IN OTHER MAJOR PANDEMICS

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:23.946
WE'VE SEEN ORIGINATING FROM DO

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:26.315
NOT ASK ORIGINS- THE BILL THIS

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:29.318
YEAR- IS REFINED IT SEATS IT

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.287
SQUARELY FOCUSED ON THAT ISSUE

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:34.824
THE BILL IS NO LONGER- TOUCHING

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:37.560
ON ON SOME OF THE- ISSUES

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.695
AROUND TROPHIES IMPORTATION OF

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.564
TROPHIES OR ANIMAL PARTS. ARE

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.265
AT THIS POINT WE THINK THE NEW

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:44.767
MINISTRATION THAT IS IN

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:45.735
POSITION TO HANDLE SOME OF

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:48.304
THOSE BROADER. CONSERVATION IN

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.339
IMPORTATION CONCERNS- BUT THE

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:51.574
BILL HERE TODAY IS SQUARELY

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.944
FOCUSED ON- THE MOVEMENT

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:57.380
TRAFFICKING IMPORTATION TRADE

01:06:57.446 --> 01:07:00.683
OF LIVE ANIMALS IN CALIFORNIA

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.884
IN VARIOUS KINDS OF MARKET

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:04.987
PLACES- AND WE THINK THAT. THIS

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.756
MEASURE IS CRITICAL TO

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:09.692
PREVENTING- THE NEXT PANDEMIC-

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:10.593
THAT THAT THESE KIND OF

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.294
PREVENTATIVE WORK HAVING A

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.663
COORDINATED ENFORCEMENT ABILITY

NOT JUST WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:18.401
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE BUT-

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:20.236
HOPEFULLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:22.471
INTERSTATE AND A FEDERAL BASIS

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:28.210
WILL PREVENT US. FROM HAVING

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:28.778
GAPS IN OUR SYSTEM WHERE YOU

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:30.746
HAVE CITY ONE CDS RANGER. YOU

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:35.518
SOME OF THIS STUFF OR RELYING

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.653
SIMPLY ON PAPER DATA BUT NOT

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.121
HAVING ENOUGH BOOTS ON THE

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.223
GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT- WERE

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.225
ABLE TO STOP- BLACK MARKET

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.494
ACTIVITY THAT COULD POSE A RISK

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.096
TO HEALTH AND SAFETY. AS WELL

01:07:47.163 --> 01:07:49.598
AS STATES BIODIVERSITY- HOWEVER

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:51.801
I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR- WE WE'VE

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:52.968
BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF THOSE

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:54.437
CONCERNED WITH THIS BILL THAT

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:56.939
THINK IT'S IT MAY BE A PROXY

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:59.208
FOR- REACHING INTO THE

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.777
ACTIVITIES OF. ZOOS IN THE

BUT STATE PUBLICLY THAT IS

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.561
REALLY NOT THE INTENTION OF

THIS LEGISLATION. WE ARE

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:22.698

UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:27.636
CDFW- WOULD PRO ACTIVELY

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.672
SUSPEND THE ABILITY TO IMPORT.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.346
IS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN A

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.215
WRITTEN FINDING THAT SUGGESTS

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.250

THAT- THERE THERE'S A DESIRE

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:58.501
FOR A BIT MORE CLARITY ABOUT

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.803
HOW CDFW WOULD ADMINISTER SUCH

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.304

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.729
ELIMINATION I WILL SAY A FEW

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:17.799

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:19.067
IT WAS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:21.469
THAT WAS TO LEAD A PERCENT TURN

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:24.973
OPPOSITION AND I JUST WANT TO

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:27.375
SAY TO SENATOR STERN. I AM

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:28.943
GOING TO IN A MOMENT MOVED THE

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:31.346
BILL AND VOTE FOR BUT I THINK

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:33.348
THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE FOR THE

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:34.415
FIRST ISSUE IS DESERVES A

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:35.683
DISAGREEMENT ON THE UNDERLYING

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.585
FACTS NOT EVEN A DISAGREEMENT

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:38.886
ON POLICY THERE STILL SOME

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:40.888
DISAGREEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY ON

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:42.223
THE UNDERLYING FACTS OF THE

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:44.392
SITUATION. AND I THINK IT'S

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.361
VERY IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THOSE

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:50.131
AND SEE IF WE CAN HAVE A

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:51.399
DISCUSSION BASED ON AN

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:53.468
AGREEMENT ON THE FACTS AND THEN

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:55.770
GET AT THE DISAGREEMENTS AND I

01:27:55.837 --> 01:27:58.006
THINK THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO

01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:00.208
DO ON THIS BILL SO ARE WILL

01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:02.510

EPIDEMIOLOGY RISK DOING

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:05.560
ANALYSIS THERE WE DON'T WANT TO

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:06.828
GET IN THE WAY THAT BONAFIDE

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:09.330

BONAFIDE MEDICAL RESEARCH THAT

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:29.884
REQUIRES A LOT OF FEDERAL

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.552

STUDY- THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:40.962

AND IT WAS ADHOC IT WAS DONE IN

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:17.925
THE MOMENT BECAUSE- THE MOMENT

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:08.868
THE GRANTS I THINK THE

01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:10.870
IMPORTANT THING WOULD BE. THAT

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:11.971

SURE EVERY COUNTY IS ADEQUATELY

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:15.875
FUNDED AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE

TWIKI IN AN OVERSUBSCRIBED

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:26.452

01:55:26.519 --> 01:55:28.454
