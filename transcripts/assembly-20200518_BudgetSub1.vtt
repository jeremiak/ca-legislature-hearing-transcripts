00:29:57.795 --> 00:29:59.831
LOOK AT THE- THREE COLUMNS THE

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.466
FIRST THREE COLUMNS. THIS IS

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:03.201
REALLY SHOWING YOU. A PICTURE

00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:04.769
OF THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:05.970
NINETEEN TWENTY. AND IT'S

00:30:06.037 --> 00:30:07.005
SHOWING YOU WHAT THE

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:08.239
ADMINISTRATION THOUGHT THE

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.374
MAJOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.376
PROGRAMS WHAT COST. AT THE TIME

00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:12.977
OF THE JANUARY BUDGET. AND

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:14.646
COMPARING IT TO MAY. AND

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:16.314
SHOWING YOU THE DIFFERENCE. I

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:17.549
THINK THE TAKE AWAY HERE IS

00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:19.317
THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:20.285
CHANGE IN THE CAL WORKS

00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:22.353
PROGRAM. THE CHANGES HERE ARE

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.222
RELATIVELY MODEST THEY REALLY

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:25.790
ENCOMPASS CHANGES IN CASE

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:28.526
LOADING COST. ALSO THERE WERE

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:30.161
SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:31.229
BY THAT HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:33.598
SERVICES AGENCY. AND THE MONTH

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.934
OF MARCH AND APRIL. TO PROVIDE

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.469
RELIEF. TO COUNTIES AND TWO

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.605
RECIPIENTS OF PROGRAMS AS THEY

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:41.873
DEALT. WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.174
CRISES. THE OTHER THING THAT'S

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:45.109
REFLECTED IN THE TWENTY

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.244
NINETEEN TWENTY NUMBERS. ARE

00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:47.512
THE FACT THAT THE STATE HAS

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:48.913
SECURED ENHANCED FEDERAL

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.114
FUNDING THROUGH THAT FEDERAL

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:52.584
MEDICAID ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.586
OR MAP INCREASE OF SIX PERCENT.

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:55.720
AND THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:57.522
OFFSETTING STATE GENERAL COSTS

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.357
FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS. BUT AGAIN

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:00.892
THE REAL STORY HERE IS THAT THE

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:02.460
CHANGES IN NINETEEN TWENTY A

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.127
RELATIVELY MODEST WITH THE

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.929
EXCEPTION OF CAL WORKS. AND

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:06.264
THAT IS REALLY DRIVEN BY AN

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:08.266
INCREASEIN THE CASE LOAD WHICH

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:09.934
WILL DISCUSS LATER. MOVING OVER

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.970
TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.004
COMPARISON AGAIN THIS IS

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:14.072
SHOWING YOU. WHAT THE

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:15.506
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATED THE

00:31:15.573 --> 00:31:17.175
PROGRAMS TO COST IN TWENTY

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:18.476
EIGHT IN JANUARY AND COMPARING

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.278
THAT TO MAY. AND HERE IS WHERE

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.946
YOU EE SOME REAL VARIANCE AND

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:24.415
SAM. IS A MARKED DIFFERENCES

00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:25.350
AND CHANGES AND THIS IS

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:28.319
BECAUSE- IT IS A FULL YEAR OF

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:30.488
CASELOAD IMPACTS. THAT ARE

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.624
ASSOCIATED WITH A CORONA VIRUS.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.225
SO AGAIN MAJOR INCREASES AND

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:35.827
PROGRAMS LIKE HOW IT WORKS ARE

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:36.427
ESTIMATED BY THE

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.930
ADMINISTRATION. ADDITIONALLY IT

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:40.665
SHOWING A FULL YEAR OF FEDERAL

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.167
FUNDING RELIEF. I'M THAT

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:45.236
OFFSETS GENERAL FUND COSTS. AND

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:47.405
THEN FINALLY IT'S IT REFLECTS

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:48.539
THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:50.541
PROPOSALS WHICH HAVE. VARIOUS

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:51.809
REDUCTIONS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:54.312
DEPARTMENTS WHICH WE WILL AGAIN

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:56.147
DISCUSS LATER. THE FINAL COLUMN

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:57.315
REALLY SHOWS THE YEAR OVER

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:59.384
DIFFERENCES BASED ON OUR BEST

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.486
ESTIMATES AND AGAIN. THE MAJOR

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:02.020
CHANGES THAT WHICH WE WILL

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:04.522
DISCUSS. TURNING TO THE NEXT

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:05.923
PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE WOULD

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.659
JUST NOTE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:08.626
TO LOOK AT NOT JUST THE GENERAL

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.061
FUND CHANGES TO REALLY

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:10.995
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:12.030
THE PROGRAMS BUT TO LOOK AT

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:14.465
TOTAL COSTS. THAT'S ESPECIALLY

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:15.800
IMPORTANT FOR THE WHOLE WORKS

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.568
PROGRAM ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:18.870
FUND COSTA SHOWING A VERY

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:21.105
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

00:32:21.172 --> 00:32:24.175
YEAR OVER BASIS- OF OVER TWO

00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:24.676
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT

00:32:24.742 --> 00:32:25.743
PERCENT. THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.011
TOTAL FUNDS THE INCREASE IS

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:28.246
STILL VERY SIGNIFICANT AN

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:30.648
UNPRECEDENTED BUT IT'S CLOSER

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.083
TO FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. AND THIS

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.217
IS REALLY DRIVEN BY AN

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:34.752
ESTIMATED INCREASE IN THE

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:36.387
HOWARD CASE LOAD ON A YEAR OVER

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:40.124
BASIS A SEVENTY FIVE POINT 6%

00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.392
ANOTHER PROGRAM WHERE IT'S VERY

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:43.928
IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.496
ALL FUNDS NOT JUST THE GENERAL

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:47.231
FUND IS AN IN HOME SUPPORTIVE

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:49.133
SERVICES PROGRAM. FOR THAT

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.368
PROGRAM YOU WILL HAVE NOTICED

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:53.071
ON THE PRIOR PAGE THAT. THE

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:53.671
GENERAL FUND WAS EXPECTED TO

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:56.341
DECREASE. IN A YEAR OVER BASIS.

00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:57.342
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT TOTAL

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:59.143
FUNDS. IT'S ACTUALLY EXPECTED

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.745
TO INCREASE BY OVER 8% AND

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:02.347
AGAIN THIS IS THE EFFECT OF THE

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:04.082
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE RELATED TO

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:05.249
THE AFTERMATH WHICH WE USED TO

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:07.185
OFFSET THE GENERAL FUND COST OF

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:10.388
THE PROGRAM. SHE TURNING NOW TO

00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:12.557
THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:13.658
FIRST WHEN WE FIRST RECEIVED

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:15.326
THE MAYOR VISION WE THOUGHT IT

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:16.194
IMPORTANT TO LOOK BACK AT THE

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.196
JANUARY PROPOSAL AS YOU'LL

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:19.964
RECALL IN JANUARY THE BUDGET

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.599
PICTURE WAS VERY DIFFERENT SO

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:22.834
THE ADMINISTRATION HAD SEVERAL

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.635
MAJOR AUGMENTATION PROPOSALS

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:26.504
BEFORE YOU AND WE REALLY WANTED

00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:28.005
TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:28.606
TREATMENT OF THOSE IN THE NAY

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.842
REVISION. GENERALLY THE

00:33:30.908 --> 00:33:32.410
TREATMENT FALLS INTO THREE

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:34.011
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SOME OF

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:35.780
THE PROPOSALS IN FACT MANY OF

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.482
THEM HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN SOME

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:39.350
OF THOSE AUGMENTATION PROPOSALS

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.385
SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:42.453
SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED FOR

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.256
EXAMPLE- IN JANUARY THE

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:46.724
GOVERNOR WAS PROPOSING TO

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.059
CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT OF

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.927
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AT

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:50.528
THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:52.997
AGENCY. AND NOW THAT PROPOSAL

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:55.333
IS TO MOVED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.701
INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:59.170
SERVICES AS PART OF THE VISION

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:00.805
SO SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION TO

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:03.641
THAT PROPOSAL THERE ARE A FEW

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:05.109
JANUARY PROPOSALS THAT ROUTINE

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:07.245
AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO A

00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:08.780
COMPLETE INVENTORY OF THOSE

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:11.749
THAT YOU HAVE BEST INFORMATION

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:16.354
YOU GO FORWARD AND JUST. THANK

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:20.758
YOU. PAGE OF THE HANDOUT.

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:22.360
YOU'LL SEE THE I'M OF MAJOR

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:23.428
PROPOSALS THE MAJOR MAYOR

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:24.562
BUDGET REDUCTION PROPOSALS PUT

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:26.931
FORWARD BY THE ADMIN. I THINK

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:29.600
ONE BIG TAKEAWAY HERE IS TAT

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:30.902
AT UNLIKEOTHER AREAS OF THE

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.770
BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK

00:34:32.837 --> 00:34:34.071
A MORE TARGETED APPROACH AND

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:37.375
HUMAN SERVICES- SOLUTIONS IT

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.143
WAS NOT SORT OF BLANKET OVERALL

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.746
PERCENTAGE DECREASE AS BUT MORE

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:43.948
US SPECIFIC SPECIFIC ADD

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:45.716
DECREASES FOR A SPECIFIC

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:47.885
PROGRAM. ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.854
HERE IS THAT THERE ARE REALLY

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:51.289
TWO TYPES OF REDUCTIONS IN

00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:52.790
FRONT OF YOU. THERE ARE THE

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:54.091
ONES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:55.259
PUTTING FORWARD AS PART OF

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:57.395
THEIR BASELINE BUDGET PROPOSAL

00:34:57.462 --> 00:34:58.696
THAT THEY WILL DO YOU NO MATTER

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.665
WHAT. AND THEN THERE ARE A

00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:03.100
CATEGORY OF REDUCTION OF THEIR

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:04.035
WE ARE REFERRING TO AS TRIGGER

00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:05.236
REDUCTIONS AND THESE ARE

00:35:05.303 --> 00:35:07.071
REDUCTIONS THAT ONLY GO INTO

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:10.174
PLACE IF FEDERAL FUNDING OF

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:12.643
FOURTEEN BILLION IS NOT. IS NOT

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.612
SECURED BY THE STATE. SOLVE ALL

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:15.813
WALK THROUGH THESE LESS AT A

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.949
HIGH LEVEL AND THE FIRST ONE IS

00:35:18.015 --> 00:35:19.784
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. THE

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.285
PROPOSAL IS TO ELIMINATE THE

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:23.087
MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:25.289
PROGRAM. THIS IS A PROGRAM FOR

LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:28.926
QUALIFY FOR SKILLED NURSING

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.728
FACILITY AND IT PROVIDES CASE

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.663
MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO THEM IN

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.299
THEIR HOME. THE NEXT PROPOSAL

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:36.467
IS TO REDUCE THE SENIOR

SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM AT THE

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.606

PROPOSAL THERE WAS ACTUALLY A

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.035
PROPOSAL TO INCREASE FUNDING

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:15.840
DIFFERENT APPROACH HERE THAT

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE EXACTLY

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:36.460
WHAT THAT WOULD BE. AND THEN

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:38.395
SEVENTY MILLION OF IT WOULD BE

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:40.497
FROM EFFICIENCIES. THEY'RE ALSO

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:42.366
PROPOSING TO ENFORCE A UNIFORM

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:44.235

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.169
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN IN

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.737
STATUTE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.005
HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED AND WOULD

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:50.174
REQUIRE. ESSENTIALLY FOURTEEN

ENROLLMENT IN MEDICAID WAIVER

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:03.087
PROGRAM SO THIS WOULD IDENTIFY

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:04.388
INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:06.023
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID WAIVER

IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:17.001
OF THE MAJOR REDUCTION

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.569

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:25.409
ASSESSMENT OF THESE INDICATE

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:27.044
THAT THEY ARE PRIMARILY AIMED

UNPRECEDENTED IN ESTIMATED

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:52.703

AS YOU HAD MENTIONED. THE EARLY

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.705
INTERVENTION SIDE OF THE

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:04.907
CHILDREN WHO ARE MOVING FROM

EARLY START INTO SCHOOL AGE SO

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.245
THE REGIONAL CENTERS EED TO DO

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:18.787
SERVICE COORDINATOR TO MAKE

SURE THAT THEIR SERVICE

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:20.890
COORDINATOR RATIOS ARE

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.558
RESPONSIVE TO THE YOUNGER KIDS.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:23.926
REGIONAL CENTERS WOULD HAVE THE

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.295
ABILITY TO MATCH THAT AND THEN

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:28.030
IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS IN WHICH

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:31.066
AB ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:33.502
SERVICE COORDINATION- MAY BE

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.739
APPROPRIATE TO STOP ME. ONE

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.073
EXAMPLE THAT IS THAT REGIONAL

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.475
CENTERS KANSEN TO DEPARTMENT

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:42.011
AND ALTERNATE CASELOAD RATIO OR

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:44.246
SERVICE COORDINATION. SO IF

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.517
PARTICULAR POPULATION THAT THEY

MEET THEIR NEEDS THAT WOULD

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:57.059
MEAN THAT A SERVICE COORDINATOR

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:58.661
COULD HAVE A HIGHER CASELOAD

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.663
RATIO AS COMPARED TO MAYBE.

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:02.565
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED A

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.533
MORE INTENSIVE SUPPORT. SO

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.634
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.636
LOOKING AT- AS FAR AS NOT BEING

TO ALMOST FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:44.105
ON THAT OBVIOUSLY PUT

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.408
SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURE ON

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.642
EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE HUMAN

ACCURATE OR THAT TO ME THAT

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:59.654
SEEMS FAIRLY HIGH ESPECIALLY

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.856
GIVEN THAT CAL WORKS NOT EVEN

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:02.390
THE EASIEST PROGRAM IN THE

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:05.327
WORLD TO GET ON TO. IT DID

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:06.728
STAND OUT TO US THAT AS A

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.563
REMARKABLE INCREASE AGAIN WE'RE

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:10.065
IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:12.400
LOOKING AT IT WE HAVE. HAD

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:13.802
DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH THE

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:15.203
DEPARTMENT AND WE ARE LEARNING

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.405
MORE- BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:20.709
MORE QUESTIONS- ESPECIALLY- OR

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:21.810
ONE OF OUR KEY QUESTIONS IS HOW

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:22.644
IT INTERACTS WITH THE

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.379
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.815
AND HOW IF INDIVIDUALS HAVE

01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:29.184
RECENTLY LOST EMPLOYMENT WITH

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:30.952
THEY ENTER- THE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:32.954
SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME AS CAL

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.956
WORKS AND IF SO. WITH THAT HOW

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:36.258
WOULD THAT AFFECT THEIR AVERAGE

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:37.993
GRANT SO EVEN IF THEY ARE AND

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.628
BOTH PROGRAMS WITH WITH THEIR

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.229
COFFEE LAST SO WE HAVE A- YEAH

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:42.864
BUT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:43.698
RELATED TO THAT ALONG THE SAME

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:45.133
LINES THAT YOU'RE ASKING. SINCE

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.134
SOME OF THOSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:48.270
CLARITY WHETHER OR NOT. PEOPLE

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.537
WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED BUT GO ON

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:53.241
UNEMPLOYMENT FIRST AND THEN ON

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:54.476
CAL WORKS. AT SOMETHING WE'RE

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:55.744
TRYING TO LOOK INTO AS WELL-

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.412
ESTIMATE ASSUMES THAT IT WOULD

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.214
BE CONCURRENT ARE NOT. AND A

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.915
LACK OF THIRTY IS MORE RELATED

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:02.183
TO JUST NOT HAVING ENOUGH TIME

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.485
SINCE THAT THE MAYOR VISION TO

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:04.753
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT WITH

01:22:04.819 --> 01:22:05.687
THEM BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.122
THEM AND THEY- THEY MET WITH US

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:08.323

YOU COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.656
THE METHODOLOGY ON THE

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:43.291
QUADRUPLE THE IN ALMOST 40%

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:46.594
INCREASE FROM ON THIS FISCAL

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.430

01:22:55.937 --> 01:23:00.175
DORSEY FINANCE. SO YEAH I MEAN.

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:02.344
WE TRIED TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.379
AT HISTORICAL IMPACT OF

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:07.716
UNEMPLOYMENT ON ON CASE LOAD

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:10.485
AND- TRIED AS BEST WE CAN TO

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:11.953
TRY TO APPLY THAT TO TODAY'S

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:16.224
SITUATION- A KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:17.592
KNOW EVERY ESTIMATE IS NOT

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:20.328
GOING TO BE SPOT ON- BUT THIS

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:22.063
IS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.965
ENVIRONMENT TO. JUST SORT OF

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:26.201
MAKE THESE PROJECTIONS AND-

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:27.369
THIS IS KIND OF WHERE WE THINK

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:28.770
IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO BE

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.205
OVER THE COURSE OF THAT TWENTY

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:33.141
TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. PRETTY

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.576
THAT CAN YOU GIVE US. A LITTLE

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:38.046
MORE DETAIL. WHAT WAS WHAT WAS

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.848
THE METHODOLOGY YOU WENT TO

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.850
REACH THIS BECAUSE- BECAUSE

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.184
YOU'RE BASICALLY ASKING US TO

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.253
CUT THREE ALMOST THREE BILLION

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.390

BUDGET BECAUSE OF YOUR ESTIMATE.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.095
I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY OF

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.063
LOOKING AT IT THE OTHER WAY OF

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.664
LOOKING AT IT IS THAT WE'RE

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.299
ASKING TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO

01:23:58.366 --> 01:23:59.267
THE PEOPLE THAT WE THINK ARE

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:00.568
GONNA COME INTO THE COLLEGE

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:01.603
PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT YEAR

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:04.272
RIGHT. AT WHAT IF I DON'T I'M

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:06.574
NOT MISTER DORSEY. WELL NOW

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:08.042
WOULD BE. AND WE LOCAL THESE

CUTS AND- ALL WE HAVE IS MONEY

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.515
IN THE BANK FOR SERVICES WHEN.

YOU KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:16.518
SENIORS WITH MANY FAMILIES NOT

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:19.487
GETTING SERVICES. AND THEN THE

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:20.088
STATE'S GOT MONEY IN THE BANK

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:21.956
WHICH I REALLY DIDN'T. THE

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:24.426
NEEDS OF THEIR NEEDS NEEDED THE

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:24.959

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:37.839

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:40.775
PROJECTIONS AS YOU KNOW AS- YOU

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:43.845

YOU'RE SEEING IS THE RESULT OF

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:09.604
AN INCREASE IN THE CASE CLOSELY

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:11.473
AT FIVE. AND MORE SPECIFICALLY

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:13.408
THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHO WE

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:14.876
EXPECT TO BE ACCESSING THE CAL

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:17.779
WORKS PROGRAM. IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:20.181

FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES- AND

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:30.625
THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THE COST

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:33.761
INCREASE IN THE PROGRAM. WE'RE

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:35.630
LOOKING FOR AN APPLICATION

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.499

SERVE. GOD IN APPRECIATE SO

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:48.176
SOLDIERS JUST TO REPEAT WHAT I

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:49.944
THOUGHT WHAT E JUST DID WAS.

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:51.679
ON THE ESTIMATE IS WE HAVE

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:55.283
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FAMILIES

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.884
FORTY THOUSAND FAMILIES AROUND

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.352

01:25:57.418 --> 01:26:01.022
THOUSAND FAMILIES. ABOUT BIRTH

01:26:01.089 --> 01:26:02.357
I GUESS I'M JUST OF TRYING TO

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:05.493
STAY ON THE BUDGET MATH BECAUSE

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.929
THAT'S NOT QUITE A DOUBLING BUT

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:10.431
THE BUDGETS A QUADRUPLING SO IS

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:12.267
IT BECAUSE YOU ANTICIPATE MORE.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.702
FAMILIES WITH MOM MANY MORE

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:17.906
CHILDREN OR- I'M NOT SURE I

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.774
DIDN'T I HAVE NOT HAD THE ELLIE

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.142
OWES CHART PREVIOUSLY TO BE

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.844
ABLE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THAT I

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.112
THINK PART OF WHAT COULD BE

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:25.580
COMPLICATING THE PICTURE HERE

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:26.881
AND WE CAN WORK WITH THEM MORE

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.116
TO TRY TO IDENTIFY IF THIS IS

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.551
THE CASE. IS THAT THE GENERAL

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.152
FUND AND HANNAH FUNDS ARE

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:33.855
FAIRLY FUNGIBLE AND SO HOW MUCH

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:36.591
WE- ADJUST THE BUDGET THAT

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:38.359
LOOKS LIKE GENERAL FUND VERSUS

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:39.527
THE WAY THAT WE ARE APPLYING

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.262
OUR TANNER FUNDS WHICH ARE. ARE

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:42.730
HISTORICALLY ALSO TRANSFERRED

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:43.765
TO OTHER PROGRAMS AND WE'LL BE

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:45.166
BACK TO SOME EXTENT IN THE

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:46.668
PUBLIC PROGRAMS COULD BE

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:47.936
COMPLICATING A LITTLE BIT THE

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:50.738
PICTURE. SO WE CAN WORK WITH

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:51.973
THEM TO TRY TO CROSS REFERENCE

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.575
ALL OF MINE ARE VARIOUS STARTS

01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:55.877
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS. AN

01:26:55.944 --> 01:27:00.615
ACTUAL INCREASE IN WHAT IS A

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:01.916
HOT SHOWING UP THAT WAY. GREAT

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:02.483
AND I THINK I THINK OUR OUR

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:05.153
OBJECT. WE WANNA TRY TO AS I

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:07.188
DEARLY ANTICIPATE CASELOAD AS

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:10.658
POSSIBLE BIRD GIVE GIVE BRING-

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:12.927
A TIME WE HAVE SO MANY FAMILIES

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.162
SUFFERING THE SOMEBODY

01:27:14.228 --> 01:27:15.563
POPULATIONS ON THIS CHART

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:17.765
GETTING CAUGHT WOULD RATHER NOT

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:20.068
HAVE TO CUT THOSE SERVICES IF

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:22.170
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO SO I KNOW.

01:27:22.236 --> 01:27:24.772
THAT NO PROJECTION IS PERFECT

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:26.441
WE ALL WE ALL KNOW THAT- BUT I

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:27.875
THINK WE ALSO WANT TO BE

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:31.379
CAREFUL NOT TO DO ANYTHING- ANY

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:33.748
ANY UNNECESSARY CUTS THAT WE

01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:35.216
DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:36.150

QUESTION TO THEM SO WE HAVE.

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:51.032
THE ANALYSIS BUT DID THE LA ILL

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.533
LOOK AT ANY KIND OF THE COOL

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.601
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COST

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:56.037
SHIFTING. THE COST IS TO LOSE

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:59.507
IT IN. HOSPITALIZATION OR

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:01.109
PEOPLE BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:04.212
BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION IN

01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:07.015
SERVICES WHAT THAT WOULD COST

01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:13.054
HIM IN. AND IN RESPONSE TO THIS

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:16.724
AND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW- ONE ONE

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.092
OF THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:20.762
RECOGNIZE WAS SEA BASS. ONE OF

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:21.596
THE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:24.532
CALIFORNIA ALREADY- LEAVING THE

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.601
SYSTEM. AND THIS IS GOING TO

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:29.737
BE- TRAVEL AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.372
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE AS

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:32.874
ASSERTING IS TALKED ABOUT.

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:37.545
LOOKING AT. PROJECTIONS OF

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:39.914
BEING ABLE TO HAVE A PLAN B.

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:42.016
WHAT IS THE PLAN B. IF THE

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:44.185
PROJECTIONS ARE CORRECT OR OF

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:46.554
COST SHIFTING WASN'T

01:28:46.621 --> 01:28:48.990
ACKNOWLEDGED SO. HAS THE LA YOU

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:53.828
LOOK AT THE- END RESULTS OF

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:57.465
COST SHIFTING IF IS SALUTE INST

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:59.133
TO INSTITUTIONALIZING OR

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.601
HOSPITALIZATION TECH HAS TO

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.003
TAKE PLACE BECAUSE OF

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.305
REDUCTIONS OF SERVICES BECAUSE

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.773
PEOPLE JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.342
PROVIDE IT BASED ON WHAT IS IN

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:14.148
THIS BUDGET. THAT THAT IS NOT

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:15.550
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HAD A

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:17.585
CHANCE TO LOOK AT- FOR ALL OF

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:20.121
THESE PROPOSALS AT THIS POINT-

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.489
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.391
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE MALL-

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:24.826
BUT I THINK THAT YOUR YOUR

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:25.960
POINT IS A GOOD ONE AND ONE

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.295
THAT COMES UP OFTEN IN AND

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:28.396
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.264
PROGRAMS IS KIND OF. NOT JUST

01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:32.600
THINKING ABOUT AT THE SAVINGS

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:33.935
THE IMMEDIATE SAVINGS BUT MAYBE

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:35.136
WHAT WHAT THE POTENTIAL

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.838
DOWNSTREAM COSTS COULD BE THOSE

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:38.840
ARE VERY DIFFICULT ESTIMATES TO

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:40.608
MAKE- THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:41.809
ASSUMPTIONS BUT THERE ARE

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.211
SOMETHING THAT. WE SHOULD BE

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:45.713
MINDFUL OF- AS AS WERE

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.249
EVALUATING THE BUDGET. THANK

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:49.851
YOU AND WITH THAT I SEE NO

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:50.918
FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.620
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS I'M GOING TO

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:54.021
BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAIR TO

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:56.157
ASK THE FINAL FEW QUESTIONS.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.693
BUT DO WANT TO THANK THE FELLOW

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.294
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FOR ASKING SUCH

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:02.230
DETAILED QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.464
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MAIN

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.099
PURPOSE OF TODAY IS FOR THE

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:07.702
PUBLIC TO. ALLOW US TO HEAR

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:09.771
FROM THEM. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:11.172
THAT I DID WANT TO ASK THE

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.707
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND YOU

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:15.676
MISTER DORSEY IF I COULD. WHICH

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.512
OF THE PROPOSED CUTS COULD

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:20.148
POTENTIALLY DEGRADE OUR ABILITY

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:22.383
TO SUCCESSFULLY RECOVER. FROM

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:23.284
THE ECONOMIC RECESSION THAT

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:31.659
WE'RE IN. SO YEAH I MEAN I

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:35.496
THINK THAT'S. I'VE BEEN

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:36.664
IMPORTANT PART OF KIND OF WHAT

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:38.132
WE TRIED TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR BY

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:39.300
MAINTAINING ELIGIBILITY TO

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:42.670
SERVICES SO- BUT THAT THERE IS

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:45.306
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT I'M WE

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:46.641
REALLY NEED ASSISTANCE FROM THE

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.509
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THE STATE

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:52.480
IS NOT ABLE. TO WHETHER A

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:53.948
RECESSION OF THIS MAGNITUDE

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:55.383
WITHOUT THAT KIND OF

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:59.320
ASSISTANCE- AND CONTINUED OUR

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:00.388
PROGRAMS THE WAY THAT THEY'RE

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:03.991
CURRENTLY STRUCTURED- AND SO-

01:31:04.058 --> 01:31:05.960
THAT IS WHY THAT THE STRUCTURE

01:31:06.027 --> 01:31:07.495
WAS PUT IN PLACE TO SAY

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:08.996
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WE

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:09.897
WANT TO TRY TO MAINTAIN

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:12.600
ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICES. AND

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:14.735
THAT IF WE CAN GET ASSISTANCE

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.637
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:18.673
CAN AVOID THAT THE MAJORITY OF

01:31:18.739 --> 01:31:21.409
THESE REDUCTIONS AND OF RECOVER

01:31:21.475 --> 01:31:22.944
MORE QUICKLY AND THAT'S THE

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:25.546
GOAL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:27.381
ABOUT PLANNING FOR. IF I CAN

01:31:27.448 --> 01:31:29.584
MISTER DORSEY AND I DO WANT TO

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.452
HEAR FROM MR ME H. REGARDING-

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:33.855
THIS NEXT RESPONSE. BUT HOW DID

01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:35.857
THE ADMINISTRATION HELP TO

01:31:35.923 --> 01:31:38.359
ASSESS WHICH OF THESE CUTS. MAY

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:39.994
FURTHER PUT PUBLIC HEALTH AT

01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:42.063
RISK TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE

01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:46.100
POPULATIONS. WELL I THINK WHAT

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:49.871
YOU'LL SEE IS THAT. WE HAVE

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:52.974
TRIED TO CONTINUE INVESTMENTS-

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.011
IN IN CERTAIN KEY AREAS AND- SO

01:31:57.078 --> 01:31:59.280
FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR- IN OUR USE

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:00.982
OF KERR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:02.149
FUNDS AND SAY AND SAY I'M

01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:04.986
SENDING COUNTIES- MONEY THROUGH

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:07.588
THAT PROCESS- BUT CERTAINLY

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:08.289
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:10.157
DECISIONS YOU CAN MAKE WITH

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:10.958
THAT WITH A POT OF MONEY LIKE

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.793
THAT THAT GIVEN. THE PANDEMIC

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.795
THAT WERE INVOLVED IN A THAT

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:15.763
WAS A KEY TO THE BUDGET

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:19.834
STRUCTURE- AND AGAIN NOT

01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.035
REDUCING ELIGIBILITY FOR

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:22.904
SERVICES I THINK THAT WAS THESE

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.372
ARE SOME KIND OF T. PLACES

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:27.608
WHERE WE TRIED TO MANAGE A VERY

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:29.277
VERY DIFFICULT BUDGET

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:31.479
ENVIRONMENT WITH- PANDEMIC

01:32:31.545 --> 01:32:34.148
RESPONSE AND TRYING TO-

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:35.583
PRIORITIZE AS BEST WE COULD

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:37.151
GIVEN THE DIFFICULT

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:37.985
CIRCUMSTANCES AND I'M- HAPPY

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:41.022
THAT. ENDED OVER TO MY AGENCY

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:45.793
CALLED. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.161
DOCTOR ARAMBULA I MEAN I THINK

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:48.496
THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:49.797
UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:52.600
DECISIONS AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:54.435
ACTIVELY RESPONDING TO A-

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.037
WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC IN THE STATE

01:32:56.103 --> 01:32:58.439
OF CALIFORNIA. OUR GOAL WAS

01:32:58.506 --> 01:32:59.707
FIRST AND FOREMOST TO MAKE SURE

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:01.642
THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:04.612
HAVE- INCOME AND SO AS YOU WILL

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:05.546
SEE THAT IN THE CAL WORKS

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:07.315
PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR WE DID

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:09.717
NOT CUT GRANTS- WE WANTED TO

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:10.685
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAD

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:12.286
INCOME. IN ORDER FOR THEM

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:13.421
WHETHER THIS AND THEN THE

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:14.956
SECOND PIECE REALLY TO DOCTOR

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:17.325
MISTER DARCY'S COMMENT. IS THAT

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:18.225
WE DID NOT WANT TO CUT

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.994
ELIGIBILITY TO OUR PROGRAMS BUT

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:21.829
RATHER WHAT WE FOCUSED ON IS.

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:25.132
ELIMINATING THOSE PARTICULAR-

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:27.268
INITIATIVES OR EFFORTS THAT WE

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:28.736
HAD PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:31.706
BUDGET OR THOSE ITEMS THAT WE

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:33.207
ARE AT PASSED IN THE TWENTY

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:34.442
NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THAT WERE

01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:35.476
EITHER NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED OR

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:37.044
WORK TO BE BE IMPLEMENTED. WE

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.846
REDUCED OUR STUFF ALWAYS HERE

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:40.681
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:42.350
NEED IT CASH ASSISTANCE WERE

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:44.251
ABLE TO GET CASH ASSISTANCE AND

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:45.653
THAT'S WHERE WE FOCUSED OUR

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.255
ENERGY IN TERMS OF THIS MAY

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:50.124
REVISION. IF I CAN MR ME

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:52.126
TONIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:53.761
FROM THE PUBLIC REGARDING

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:56.630
PROPOSALS. BUT I DID WANNA WAY

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:58.833
AND MYSELF AS THE CHAIR TO SOME

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.067
OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE IN

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:01.702
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT DID GET

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:03.771
TAKEN OUT. THAT I DO THINK

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:05.539
WE'LL HAVE DRAMATIC EFFECTS.

01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:07.341
THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:10.411
SYSTEM IS CRITICAL FOR MANY OF

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:12.913
OUR FAMILIES WHO. ARE SEEKING

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.116
SERVICES THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:17.451
HOTLINE WILL BE NECESSARY AND

01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:19.286
WAS QUITE IMPORTANT FOR MANY OF

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:21.122
US TO BE ADVOCATING FOR LAST

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:23.157
YEAR. IN ADDITION THE CAL WORKS

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:26.060
HOME VISITING PROGRAM THAT- IS

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:28.095
SLATED TO BE CAUGHT IS.

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:30.431
CURRENTLY BEING RETROFITTED I

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:33.134
UNDERSTAND. TO ALLOW FOR

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.903
TELEVISION FOR THEM TO BE ABLE

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:37.471
TO ACCESS SERVICES. AND WHAT I

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:39.940
THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT IS THAT

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:42.009
OUR CAL WORKS OF FAMILIES

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:44.111
OFTENTIMES. OUR THE FAMILIES.

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.946
TO REALLY HELP US TO AVOID TWO

01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:49.250
GENERATIONS OF POVERTY. AND

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:49.884
REALLY DO BELIEVE THOSE ARE THE

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.119
PROGRAMS THAT ARE CAPTURE

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:55.256
CYCLICAL. SO I STARTED MY

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:58.959
QUESTION IF I COULD REALLY

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.027
TAKING MISTER DORSEY WHICH- OF

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:02.930
THE- IN OUR ABILITY. DONALD

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:04.598
TRUMP JOB OF HELPING US TO KEEP

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:07.234
OUR RATES SENSE TO ALLOW OTHERS

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:11.906
TO PARTICIPATE. MY CONCERN. IS

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:15.009
JUST WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE.

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:17.211
AND I'VE HEARD IT SAID CLEARLY

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:19.613
FROM THIS GOVERNOR AND THIS

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.916
ADMINISTRATION. THAT WE ARE A

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:23.117
GOLDEN STATE FOR YOUR GOLDEN

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:26.720
YEARS. AND HAVE CONCERNS THAT

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:29.323
THIS BUDGET AFFECTS OUR MOST

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:31.559
VULNERABLE. AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:35.096
IT'S THE SEA BASS OR MS S. P.

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:37.798
OR THE CUTS TO THE AGE TO

01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:39.033
ELDERLY AND DISABLED I HAVE

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.435
CONCERNS. THAT OUR ELDERLY ARE

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:43.571

03:10:26.882 --> 03:10:29.117
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FATE OF

03:10:29.184 --> 03:10:29.818
ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN

03:10:29.885 --> 03:10:32.621

03:10:32.687 --> 03:10:34.089
ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

03:10:34.156 --> 03:10:35.590
DOLLAR REDUCTION IN REALIGNMENT

03:10:35.657 --> 03:10:37.592
REVENUES. FOR HUMAN SERVICES

03:10:37.659 --> 03:10:39.928
PROGRAMS THAT WERE DISCUSSED BY

03:10:39.995 --> 03:10:42.364
MY COLLEAGUE SHE- I JUST DIDN'T

03:10:42.430 --> 03:10:43.865
HEAR IT FROM THE FACT IN THE

03:10:43.932 --> 03:10:47.769
ABSENT- STATE SUPPORT TO

03:10:47.836 --> 03:10:49.137
BUTTRESS THE SIGNIFICANT

03:10:49.204 --> 03:10:50.972
REDUCTION IN REVENUES. WILL BE

03:10:51.039 --> 03:10:53.475
STEEP REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES TO

03:10:53.542 --> 03:10:55.844
PROTECT PEOPLE- CHILDREN AND

03:10:55.911 --> 03:10:57.512
ADULTS ARE BEING AN ABUSED OR

03:10:57.579 --> 03:11:00.615
NEGLECTED- EXACERBATING THAT

03:11:00.682 --> 03:11:02.083
PROBLEM AT THE DECISION AND THE

03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:04.219
NEIGHBOR ADDITION. TO NOT

03:11:04.286 --> 03:11:06.922
REIMBURSED COUNTY FOR ABOUT

EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

03:11:08.857 --> 03:11:10.926
COST. FOR THE NEW RESEARCH

03:11:10.992 --> 03:11:13.228
FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. THOSE

03:11:13.295 --> 03:11:15.063
ARE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO

03:11:15.130 --> 03:11:17.666
GET CARE GIVERS TO ABUSE KIDS.

03:11:17.732 --> 03:11:19.000
IT'S ALSO MONEY THAT WE ARE

03:11:19.067 --> 03:11:21.102
CONSTITUTIONALLY ENTITLED TO

03:11:21.169 --> 03:11:22.771
UNDER PROP THIRTY WE DON'T

03:11:22.838 --> 03:11:24.306
AGREE WITH THE STATE'S

03:11:24.372 --> 03:11:26.975
INTERPRETATION. THAT THE

03:11:27.042 --> 03:11:29.110
RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL

03:11:29.177 --> 03:11:31.780
ACTIVITIES WERE NOT THAT PRE

03:11:31.847 --> 03:11:33.114
DATED TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

03:11:33.181 --> 03:11:36.117
REALIGNED THEY CLEARLY DID NOT.

03:11:36.184 --> 03:11:38.753
AND SO- WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE

03:11:38.820 --> 03:11:40.722
FUNDS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE

03:11:40.789 --> 03:11:43.658
CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED TRUE

03:11:43.725 --> 03:11:44.125
UP BROUGHT THAT UNDER

03:11:44.192 --> 03:11:45.827
PROPOSITION THIRTY. WITH

03:11:45.894 --> 03:11:47.929
RESPECT TO ELIGIBILITY-

03:11:47.996 --> 03:11:49.631
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND CAL

03:11:49.698 --> 03:11:53.201
WORKS CAL FRESH. I JUST THAT.

03:11:53.268 --> 03:11:55.070
WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME

03:11:55.136 --> 03:11:56.972
REDUCTIONS ARE INEVITABLE AND%

03:11:57.038 --> 03:11:57.806
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

03:11:57.873 --> 03:12:00.175
REDUCTIONS ACROSS ALL OF THOSE

03:12:00.242 --> 03:12:02.611
PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING

03:12:02.677 --> 03:12:03.144
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

03:12:03.211 --> 03:12:06.114
LEGISLATURE. IS THIRD CALIBRATE

03:12:06.181 --> 03:12:08.383
OUR EXPECTATION CALIBRATE

03:12:08.450 --> 03:12:10.619
ACCOUNTABILITY IN CALIBRATE OUR

03:12:10.685 --> 03:12:13.321
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATION BASED

03:12:13.388 --> 03:12:15.257
ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE HAVE.

03:12:15.323 --> 03:12:17.559
I THINK THE BUDGET ESSENTIALLY

03:12:17.626 --> 03:12:21.129
SAYS. DO YOUR BEST WE CAN'T.

03:12:21.196 --> 03:12:23.398
BOND THOSE ACTIVITIES WHERE WE

03:12:23.465 --> 03:12:26.635
OUGHT TO- WE AT THE COUNTY

03:12:26.701 --> 03:12:30.071
LEVEL- MAKING WORK AND WE WILL

03:12:30.138 --> 03:12:31.473
DO OUR BEST BUT WE HAVE TO

03:12:31.539 --> 03:12:35.143
ALIGN. REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS

03:12:35.210 --> 03:12:36.711
OF COUNTY PERFORMANCE WITH THE

03:12:36.778 --> 03:12:38.713
RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. I

03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:40.282
SHOULD SAY THE SAME THING FOR

03:12:40.348 --> 03:12:43.351
OUR CLIENTS WE HAVE TO LINE- UP

03:12:43.418 --> 03:12:45.487
A LINE OR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT

03:12:45.553 --> 03:12:47.155
WE CAN EXPECT BY WAY OF

03:12:47.222 --> 03:12:51.693
PARTICIPANTS- PARTICIPATING IN

03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:53.428
WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITIES IS

03:12:53.495 --> 03:12:54.863
ABOUT A SIX HUNDRED MILLION

03:12:54.930 --> 03:12:56.965

03:12:57.032 --> 03:12:58.600
WORKS EMPLOYMENT SERVICE THAT.

03:12:58.667 --> 03:13:00.402
WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THE

03:13:00.468 --> 03:13:02.370
ADMINISTRATION BUT I'M SURE.

03:13:02.437 --> 03:13:04.506
THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE NECESSARY

03:13:04.572 --> 03:13:06.408
BECAUSE SOME SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

03:13:06.474 --> 03:13:08.276

LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING

THERE ARE MANY FAMILIES NOW

03:20:47.568 --> 03:20:48.836

NOT HAVE THE TIME CLOCK STOPPED

03:20:53.374 --> 03:20:54.776

PLAN FOR HOW TO BALANCE THOSE

03:52:54.493 --> 03:52:56.462
TWO INTEREST. AS WE MOVE

03:52:56.529 --> 03:52:59.565
FORWARD AND WE MUST NOT FORGET

03:52:59.632 --> 03:53:01.967
THAT IN THIS TIME ONE OF THE

03:53:02.034 --> 03:53:03.169
REMARKABLE THINGS THAT WE'VE

03:53:03.235 --> 03:53:04.537
SEEN IS THAT PEOPLE WITH

03:53:04.603 --> 03:53:06.138
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAVE

03:53:06.205 --> 03:53:08.908

THEM. AND SO IT'S KIND OF

03:53:25.024 --> 03:53:26.125
IRONIC THAT NOW WE'RE IN A

03:53:26.192 --> 03:53:27.760
SPACE WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:53:27.827 --> 03:53:29.562

TO PEOPLE AND DOING THAT WHILE

03:54:06.365 --> 03:54:08.033
AT THE SAME TIME FINDING IF IT

03:54:08.100 --> 03:54:09.835
SHOULD BE THE FUNDING IS JUST A

03:54:09.902 --> 03:54:12.438
VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES-

03:54:12.505 --> 03:54:14.273
AND ONE THAT. MEANS THAT EACH

03:54:14.340 --> 03:54:15.841
PERSON SERVED IN THE SYSTEM

03:54:15.908 --> 03:54:17.476
POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE LAST

03:54:17.543 --> 03:54:19.612
SERVICE COORDINATION EFFORTS AT

03:54:19.678 --> 03:54:22.047
A TIME WHEN WE'RE EXPECTING-
