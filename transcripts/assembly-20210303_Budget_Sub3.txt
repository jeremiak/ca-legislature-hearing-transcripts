SMALL AMOUNTS OF RECEIPT RE RECEIVED BY COMPARISON ROUGHLY A YEAR AGO SO THERE'S MORE MONEY TO SPEND- WHICH IN SOME WAYS MEANS THAT TO.

WELL OPEN AGAIN- THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM AND- THIS IS ANOTHER PIECE OF THE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT CAL FIRE IS TAKING TO REDUCING THE- DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION OF WILDFIRES AND IT IS KEY TO PROTECTING. HOMES FROM BURNING BUT ALSO- INFRASTRUCTURE AND- I AM GOING TO. INTRODUCE NOW- DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ASSISTANT STATE FIRE MARSHAL. WENDY COLLINS. RECEPTUS ON FORTUNE HER CAMERA NOT WORK SO YOU'RE TO HAVE OVER. FOR HER. THANK YOU TAKE THANK IN THE MORNING THE CHAIR AND MEMBER OF THE CAN. TO BE RESPECTFUL OF YOUR TIME OPENING WILL FREE FROM US TO GET TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. MY NAME IS WENDY COLLINS AND I'M THE ASSISTANT STATE FIRE MARSHAL WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE REQUEST OF EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY SIX POSITION STARTING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. APPLE BE NECESSARY TO CONDUCT WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB THIRTY EIGHT. AND A SUBSEQUENT TRAINING AND STAFFING OF TWENTY ONE NEW FORESTRY TECH POSITION. THERE WILL BE PASSED WITH THE EVALUATION AND CERTIFICATION OF STRUCTURE HARDENING MEASURES. AND THE PROPERTY IS DISPENSABLE FACE COMPLIANCE. TO THE BUYERS OF HOMES IN HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY. AS WE THROUGH THIS PURPOSE. IT WAS IMPORTANT HIM BUT THE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS NEEDED FROM THE PALATABLE FOR PROGRAM. FIFTH IS STAFFED WITH POOREST AIDS THIS PROGRAM IS WITH HERMAN FOR TECHNO. THIS OF THE CIVIL CLASS- THE DEATH LEVEL TRAINING. AND IS THE END LEVEL LEADING TO PARK SHOPPERS FOR AT THE ONE AND. TWO THE DATE PROGRAM IT'S ON MEETING THE FIRE GOAL COMPLETING HUNDRED THOUSAND DEFENSE SPACE INSPECTIONS AND LIKE ANNUALLY. THIS PROGRAM IS THE TWENTY POOREST TECHNIQUE WILL FOCUS ON THE OF STRAW. AND ANY HOME HARDENING. THAT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED OR THE ARE OF MAY AND THEN. THAT AS PER OF A HOME SALE IN HIGHER VERY HIGH FOR SO THEY PROBLEMS IN THE SRX. AGAIN THIS IS AN ENTRY BECAUSE WITH UPPER. BUT SO IT'S NOT BE AND- THAT THE AND STAFF WOULD CREATE AND ONE. ONLY AN ADDITIONAL ONE. BUT THAT. STAFF WILL BE USING ENTRY LEVEL FOR THE AS A STEPPING TO MEET THEIR- GOALS. AND HOPEFULLY. SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY ASSISTANT. MAKING TURN OVER RE. WE MUST BE. FOR WITH THAT SAID TO BE ADDED STAFFING AND IT FOR THE TRAINING CENTER AND DAVID SMOKE QUITE. IS TO THE AND HIGHER IN THE COMPLICATED IS NOT THE. THANK YOUARE FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION AND CAL FIRE FOR TAKING THE STEPS TO INCREASE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS- BOTH FOR THIS BILL AND FOR THE B. C. P. ON A. B. THIRTY SEVENTY FOUR. WE NEED MORE INSPECTORS WE NEED MORE- INSPECTIONS BUT THIS IS A GOOD DOWN PAYMENT AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE- THIS MOVEMENT I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW THESE- DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS FIT TOGETHER. WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR DISPATCH DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS IN THE EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION ALL. YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ASK BOTH OF THEM MISTER CHAIR OR JUST ASK ONE AT A TIME. WELL I GUESS I'LL JUST ASK BOTH. THAT THE QUESTION SECOND. IS WHETHER THESE INSPECTORS WILL ONLY INSPECTORATES SAY TRANSACTIONS BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF TRAINING AND THE OTHER INSPECTORS BUT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR TO. MAXIMIZE THEIR TIME THAT AS THEY'RE TRAVELING TO. AND FROM THESE REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS IS THERE ANY THOUGHT TO USING THEM ACROSS THE BOARD FOR OTHER INSPECTIONS ALONG THE WAY SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL A LONG DISTANCE TO DO ONE INSPECTION. AND TRAVEL BACK IF THEY'RE SORT OF INSPECTIONS THEY CAN DO AS THEY'RE MOVING THROUGH THAT RELATE TO YOU KNOW ACROSS THAT THAT LAND- SO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT EFFICIENCY OF TIME AND WHETHER THEIR- TRAINING IS UP TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN DO. A DEBT THOSE ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS ARE NOT SO THOSE ARE MY TWO QUESTIONS AND AGAIN. WHEN I COMMEND CAL FIGHTER IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE FOR THIS DIRECTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION. BUT I'D LIKE TO DO IS- DEFERRED TO CHANGE. THE POCKETS. IN THE ONLINE. HAS AS HE WAS THE ONE- HE AND HIS STAFF WERE. INSTRUMENTAL IN CREATING THE METRICS. THAT IDENTIFIED THE STAFFING NEEDS. TO TALK. THANK YOU MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR THE QUESTION AND HONESTY BOX- AND I OVERSEE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS- THE SECOND QUESTION IS ABSOLUTELY WE- THE NEW PORTREE TECHNICIAN POSITIONS WILL BE TRAINED AS OUR CURRENT DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS ARE TRAINED. AND SO WHEN THEY'RE THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS WILL BE ON MEETING THE INTENT OF AB THIRTY EIGHT AND CONDUCTING THE- DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH. THE SALE OF PROPERTY- HOWEVER- WHEN THEY'RE NOT BE GAUGE AND THAT THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION AND MEETING ITS GOAL OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INSPECTIONS ANNUALLY. AND I'M NOT QUITE CERTAIN ON THE FIRST QUESTION- BUT THE PROPOSED BUDGET HAS THE FUNDING IN IT TOO- SUPPORT THE- HIRING OF THESE POSITIONS AND THE PROGRAM BUT GOING INTO THE FUTURE I'M NOT SURE IF I ANSWERED. THAT CORRECTLY OR NOT. I THINK I WOULD HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE THESE AND SEEM TO BE DEDICATED TO THIRTY SEVENTY FOUR PRIMARILY I WAS WONDERING IF THEY IMPACT ANY OTHER DEFENSIBLE SPACE- EXPENDITURES OR WORK THAT YOU'LL BE DOING BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE COMPLEMENTARY AND NOT REPLACING. ANYTHING I'LL- THAT'S CORRECT WE ARE PUMP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW IT HOW MANY. OPPORT TRANSFERS AND- HIGH FIRE ON A VERY HIGH FIRE ZONE AREA DO YOU PROJECT OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR. THAT THE BEGINNING AND I COULDN'T TAKE THAT QUESTION BUT WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER OF SALE THE PROPERTY WITHIN THE STATE AND TRANSLATED THAT TO BE S. R. A. AND WE'RE ANTICIPATING ROUGHLY. BASED ON THOSE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND- TRANSACTIONS PER YEAR- HOWEVER THAT IT'S BASED OFF OF- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THEN AGAIN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN DATA- SO IT COULD BE HIGHER COULD BE LOWER- AND- AND SO WHAT AT THE OF THE PROGRAM PROGRESSES WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE. WHAT THE TRUE LEVEL THE IMPACT. IS AND THEN ADJUST ACCORDINGLY. SO YOU ANTICIPATE THE TWENTY SIX- SESSIONS CAN DO ROUGHLY. NINE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND. INSPECTIONS ANNUALLY. IT SOUNDED LIKE WALL ORDERS FROM THE COMMISSION POSITION. I'M SORRY I CUT IT BUT- YES THEY THEY CAN HANDLE THAT WORKLOAD. OKAY. JUST ADD TO THAT IT'S A CLUB SO OTHER INSPECTORS WILL BE ABLE TO ASSIST WITH SOME OF THAT WORKLOAD- THERE WILL BE AN EVENTFUL OF THE- THOSE. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER I SEE AN ALLY IN- ALL OF THE A. B. THIRTY EIGHT CASES AS OF ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST ONE SITE VISIT. SOUTH AMERICA PROBABLY HAVE TO BE AT LEAST TO AN INITIAL AND THEN A FINAL AT SOME POINT. J. PROBLEMS THERE WILL BE- THIS NIFTY BOX AGAIN THERE'D BE ONE SITE VISIT- AND IF THEY ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS THAT WOULD ONLY REQUIRE ONE BIT THAT IF THEY'RE NON COMPLIANT. A FOLLOW UP AT THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY- ONCE THE THAT A PROPERTY OWNER HAS MITIGATED THE ISSUES- TO BRING THEIR PROPERTY INTO COMPLIANCE. OKAY I UNDERSTAND THAT. LET SER PROCEED WITH A REPORT FROM A ALEJO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BRIAN BROWN WITH THE L. A. AGAIN- FIRST IF I COULD JUST TO RESPOND TO ONE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN'S QUESTIONED THE FOR THE FIRST ONE ABOUT HOW THIS ALIGNS WITH THE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PACKAGE THERE IS SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT PACKAGE- IT IS PROPOSES ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR SIX MILLION DOLLARS- UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY OF. THAT ONE AND AB THIRTY EIGHT- PROGRAM THIS MILLION DOLLARS IN THE WILD RESILIENCE PACK WOULD BE TO- TO AUGMENT THE BASELINE DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM. PROBABLY UTILIZING A SEASONAL INSPECTORS- FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR CHIO- SO- WITHOUT THE IN IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR- WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF MOST OF THE PROPOSAL IT DOES ALIGN AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE- NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS SEN AB THIRTY EIGHT WE DID HAVE A COUPLE OF- TECHNICAL AND OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS. ONE JUST TECHNICAL SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE DO SUGGEST- THAT D. OF FUNDING THAT IS REQUESTED FOR TRAINING OF VEHICLE PROCUREMENT THE POSITION BE APPROVED JUST A ONE TIME BASIS WE DON'T THINK THE THERE'S BEEN A WORKLOAD- JUSTIFICATION FOR PROVIDING THOSE POSITION ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND THERE'S ALSO A REQUEST IN HERE FOR A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS. BY THE FIRE ENGINE FOR THE SOUTHERN TRADING ACADEMY- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING NAPPIES BECAUSE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO IMPLEMENTING AB THIRTY EIGHT. A TWO OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ONE IS- SOME ADDING SOME REPORTING LANGUAGE ON THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAM THIS ISN'T BECAUSE OF ANY PARTICULAR CONCERN WITH THE DEPARTMENT APPROACH TO ESTIMATING WORKLOAD BUT SIMPLY AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT THIS IS A NEW RESPONSIBILITY AND THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS THAT'LL BE REQUIRED OUR RECORDS. AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT'LL BE NECESSARY AND IT SHOULD BE IN THIS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- INDICATE THAT FORGET WORKLOAD TO DO THESE- INSPECTIONS IS HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED THAT COULD END UP REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO DIVERT RESOURCES FROM UP THE PROGRAMS SUCH AS BASELINE.% DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM CHECK TO MEET THIS REQUIRED WORKLOAD ITSELF WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE- PROPER AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND ALLOW. DOESN'T POLICY GESTURE IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE NEWMAN. TO CONSIDER OPTIONS TO MAKE DISCO RELAY AND- FEE BASED. FOR ASSIST US INTO REASONABLE. THING TO CONSIDER OF TWO REASONS WHY EIGHT IT. BECAUSE THIS. IS PROVIDING EITHER SERVICE TO. OWNERS AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A REASONABLE SHE BASED. AT BUT ALL BECAUSE THE EXTENT WE COULD GENERATE FEE REVENUES TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM- THAT WOULD OFFSET FUTURE. COSTS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU QUESTIONS. ISRAEL THIS. THANK YOU ARE SO OF THE L. A. O. LIKE YOU JUST MENTIONED PROPOSED THAT WE CONSIDER CHARGING HOMEOWNERS A FEE FOR THE A DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS- WHO DO WE KNOW WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION STANDS ON THIS FEE PROPOSAL. WE HAVE WITH ACID APARTMENT ON A BUT I SHOULD PROBABLY LET FIFTY FOR SELF. GOOD MORNING AT TWENTY CALLING AGAIN I'M- WE HAVE. CONTEMPLATED AND- OBVIOUSLY THE L. A- SUGGESTION ON THE FEET STUDY FOR A FEE- ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT- IT. WHILE AT IT MAY LOOK LIKE- A SERVICE THE PARTICULAR HOMEOWNER. REALLY ALLOW THE IT IS TRULY PAR- DEFENDING THE FAITH IN THE FRA FROM ANY STRUCK FIRE THAT MADE. SO IS. THAT'S ONE OF IT THE OTHER PART IS- WE'VE TRIED FRA HI PLEASE IN THE- I IT. LED TO SOME. AUTHORITIES SOME AREAS AND WE REALLY TO DO IS PICKING IN THOSE AREAS AND BE PARTNERS- ENABLING US TO REALLY PROVIDE THE BAD THAT DEFENSE IN ALL OF THOSE AREAS AND TO PROTECT THE FRA- FROM ANY SORT OF STRUCTURE FIRE THAT COMES THROUGH SO I THINK THERE WOULD BE TO BE- MORE DISCUSSION FOR SOME SORT OF- RAILED MAY BE PUT INTO. FIFTY ONE FACTOR- I DO DON'T WANT TO AS- THE DAMAGE THE MORNING. THAT BEEN BILL WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNER IN. AND THE FIRE CAN'T. IN THE CAN- IT'S A FEE THE REALLY BENEFIT EVERY IN THE STATE INCLUDING WILDLIFE AND WATERSHED PROTECTION. HI I'M- IN THE I'M SORRY. IN ADDITION THE DIP DOESN'T HAVE THE DOOR TO CALL A FEE AT THIS POINT TIME- SO WE'RE THERE WOULD NOT AT WITHOUT TO BE TAKE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. OKAY THANK JUST ONE MORE PRESS POUND FOR THE L. A- YOU KNOW- AGAIN ON THE PROPOSAL HOW WOULD THIS FEE PROPOSAL AFFECT CONTRACTS CITIES ANY CONTRACT COUNTIES SUCH AS LOS ANGELES. THAT ALREADY HAVE MUCH HIGHER DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION RATES THAN CAL FIRE. SO I IMAGINE IF THE- IF THE LEGISLATURE DID IT DECIDE TO MAKE A POLICY CHANGE AND AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED IT WOULD REQUIRE- LEGISLATIVE CHANGE TO GIVE THE AUTHORITY TO. CHARGE A FEE TO HOMEOWNERS ON THESE INSPECTIONS- I THINK HE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT PROVIDE THAT SAME AUTHORITY TO THE CONTRACT COUNTY AS WELL AND THAT. THEY COULD DO- DO THAT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWED THEM TO OFFSET THEIR COSTS THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY THE GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL WOULD INCLUDE FINDING THAT WOULD GO TO CONTRACT COUNTIES TO DO THE SAME WORK ON SRD. LANDS OKAY THANK YOU. YES SOMEONE FREE BUT ASK A FOLLOW UP IT'S MORE OF A COMMON WHICH IS THE I ON THE RUSH FOR NOT HOW A FEW GENERAL AND A SPACE WORK WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO ME OFTEN MAKE AN INVESTMENT TO CLEAR THAT PROPERTY- ONCE YOU BRING BACK YOUR REPORT ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF JUSTIFICATION FOR DURING REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS- THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR KIND OF POINT OF SALE INSPECTIONS- AND WHEN SOMEONE SPENDING YOU KNOW LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY PURCHASING A PROPERTY I THINK IT DOES BEHOOVE THEM TO HAVE. THAT REPORT NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND OF WALKING IN A LITTLE BLOCK AND MAYBE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS BUT I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT A WAY OF DOING THIS THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE EQUITABLE THAT DOING IT YOU KNOW AS PART OF A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION AT LEAST WOULD HELP GENERATE SOME REVENUE AND PROBABLY NOT GET THE KIND OF PUSH THAT YOU WOULD GET IF YOU JUST START. CHARGING THIS TO GENERAL HOMEOWNERS IN THESE AREAS SO I HOPE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S THOUGHT ABOUT. AFTER IF I COULD ADD. MY VOICE TO THIS NOT REAL. WERE NOT. WE'RE NOT READY FOR THIS YET BUT I DIDN'T VENTURA COUNTY WE VERY SUCCESSFUL AT- REQUIRING DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND THEN IF WE WENT AND SOMEBODY WAS NOT DOING IT WE WERE THEN ABLE TO CHARGE THEM- TO DO IT AND- THERE MAY BE SOME APPROACH HERE. THAT IF IT'S NOT DONE PROPERLY IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S BEST INTEREST TO HAVE IT DONE- THAT- THAT'S WHERE WE CHARGE A FEE- AND REQUIRE THE- SOME SOME CONTRIBUTION AS A RESULT OF NOT DOING IT PROPERLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU- DOES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS. HI THIS IS A MORE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU CHAIR AT IT JUST WANTED TO THAT IT RIGHT NOW AS CHIEF BORDER MISSION WE DO NOT HAVE STASHED THOR TO TRY YOU SO WITH TO HAVE FOR DISCUSS TO. EXPLORE THIS. THANK YOU. THAT WILL TAKE US NOW TO NOT THREE COME EMERGENCE RESPONSE AND PREPARE. THANK YOU SURE BELOW AND MEMBERS- IS THE FRAME UP WHAT WE KIND OF COVERING IN STROKES HERE IS- THIS ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH. WELL IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE WILDFIRE RISK IN CALIFORNIA- FOCUSED AND DELIBERATE ACTION TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES- AND IMPROVED JULES CONDITIONS ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO BETTER COEXIST WITH WILDFIRE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- FOCUSES ON PREVENTION- A PRESS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AS WE ALREADY TALKED AS WELL AS THE CO BENEFITS OF INCREASING. CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS BOOTS ON THE GROUND- INTERNET- ACTING ON THAT THAT ALSO INCLUDES THOSE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS WERE TALKING ABOUT AND ISSUE NUMBER THREE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE WITH NOW. I KNOW INDIVIDUAL TASK OR PROGRAM IS A SILVER BULLET. AND EACH OF THESE BUDGET ITEMS WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WITH THE CO EXIST WITH THE EXISTING EFFORTS IN PREVENTION AND PROTECTING AGAINST WILDFIRE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO BEFORE ISSUE NUMBER THREE I AM GOING TO SHARE WITH THE WITH DIRECTOR SAIDO OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS ARE OPENING AND THEN WILL KICK IT TO- DEPUTY DIRECTOR- CHIEF TYLER. COMPLEX REPRESENTED. EIGHTY FOUR ARE PRECISE TOOK OUT CONSERVE CORPS DIRECTOR- I'M PLEASE TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM AND CAN MEMBER FOR IN THIS- PRESIDENT ON ISSUE THREE C.

OUR OUR CREATE THE RIGHT MIX AND ALSO IN IN THE SENSE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING STAFF OF ALL OF IT TO- I TO PORTAGE TO- CHIEF DEPUTY TYLER TO PRESENT EXACTLY WHAT THE STARK FIRE EXPANSION. PROGRAM WILL LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU DIRECT AND GOOD MORNING BILLION GOOD MORNING TO THE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JOE NOT THE DEPUTY FOR PROTECTION FOR CAL- IN THIS. CAP AND CAL COME CORPS SILVA OF ONE FORTY THREE. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION. FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND IN GENERAL FUND PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS WITH SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN POSITIONS AREN'T GOING TO ACT THIRTY ADDITIONAL HAND CREWS TO PROVIDE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION PROJECTS AND WHAT ABOUT WILDFIRE- SUPPRESSION ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS PROPOSAL STAFF. BARBARA HANNIFIN OF SEVEN OF THE D. POPULAR. ACONTECE CAMPS- THAT WERE DEPOPULATED AS PART OF THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. IT'LL STAFF EIGHT YEAR ROUND CCC HAND CREWS AT FOR CCC. AND STAFF SIX SEASONAL CCC ANCHORS ADICIONAL. PARA CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS FACILITIES DURING FIRE SEASON. IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE AS OF- JANUARY I'M SORRY AS OF MARCH ONE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIANS HAVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT WILDFIRES BURNING ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES COMPARED TO THE SAME TIME FRAME IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY CALIFORNIA SOUTH FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE WILDLAND FIRES TRACER. FIFTY SIX ACRES IN THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE RIGHT AFTER THIS SAME TIME FRAME IS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE FIRES FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE ACRES WHAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY REPEAT THE TIME FRAME PLACE. BLUM HAS MARCH ONE. TWO THOUSAND ONE- BROWN SAID SO FROM JANUARY FIRST TO FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT WILDLAND FIRES FOR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES. THAT SAME TIME FRAME IN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. WILDFIRES. FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX ACRES AND I YOU LOOK AT A FIVE YEAR TIME SPAN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE ACRES FOR TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE I'M SORRY TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE FIRES FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE ACRES. IS THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE. SO THE PROPOSAL TODAY- IS. PRETTY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S. RECENT AND OF FIRE AVAIL TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. THE DECREASE HAS RESULTED IN FEWER NUMBER CREWS AVAILABLE. AVAILABLE TO PERFORM. A CRITICAL REDUCTION WORKING COMMUNITIES IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJECTS BEFORE STYLE. TO GIVE A LITTLE HAS CALVET HIS.THIS HAD A DESIGN OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TYPE ONE HAND CREWS INCLUDING A ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO FIRE CREWS TO COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND TWELVE ADDITIONAL HAND CREWS OR OR CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL FOUR CREWS THAT ARE PART OF A TRAINING PROGRAM- MULTI AGENCY TRAINING TRAINING PROGRAM AT THE VENTURA TRAINING CENTER. OVER THE LAST DECADE. THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CAMP PROGRAM HAS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE OF INMATE FIREFIGHTERS AVAILABLE TO FULLY STAFF ITS FIRE CREWS. WHICH IS RESULTED IN THE OPERATION IF YOU WERE HAND CREWS TO SUPPORT CALPERS OPERATIONS IN THE FLEET- WELL WHAT I WOULD HAVE FIRE SUPPRESSION AND HAZARDOUS FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS. AND THAT RECOGNITION OF THIS TREND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE- BUDGET OF FIFTY THOUSAND TWENTY REFLECTED A CONSOLIDATION OF INMATE FIREFIGHTERS AND THE POPULATION OF EIGHT CAMPUS OF THESE BY CDC ARE. TODAY COOPER CURRENTLY HAS AN APPROVED DESIGN CAPACITY OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT HAND CREWS. WITH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO CDCR CRUZ TWELVE CCC CREWS ENFORCEMENT TRAINING CENTER CREWS OUT OF THIRTY CONSERVATION CAMPS. FOR FIRE CENTERS. IN ONE TRAINING CENTER. BUT UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO A OF AND CO FIRE WE'RE ONLY ABLE TO STAY UP TO OF SIX FIVE SIXTY FIVE. OF THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT FULLY TRAINED AND QUALIFIED FIREFIGHTING HAND CREWS AS A CHOI AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTH OF THISYEAR. ANOTHER SIXTEEN HAND CREWS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THEIR LOCAL AREAS BUT THEY HAVE TO FEW CREWMEMBERS TO BE A TYPED IN FULLY QUALIFIED HAND CREW BY STATE NATIONAL STANDARDS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE FIRE CREWS ARE ONE OF THE MOST VERSATILE AND SPECIALIZED RESOURCES COPPER UTILIZES FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION. BY CLEARING VEGETATION AWAY FROM AN ONCOMING WILDFIRE OFTENTIMES ALONE WITHOUT HOSE LINES AND ALWAYS SUPPORTED BY FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT IN THE TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR HANDS. THEY ACCESS AND SUPPRESS FIRES BURNING IN MORE REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE TERRAIN WERE BULLDOZERS AND OTHER HEAVY. HEAVY MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT. I CANNOT TRAVERSE WITHOUT AN ADEQUATE NUMBER HANDY FOR USE FIRES WILL GROW LARGER IN THE STATE RESULTING IN INCREASED DAMAGE TO WILDLIFE AND WATERSHEDS. I WILDLIFE FISHERIES AND AIR QUALITY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT NGUYEN NOT NOT RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES THE FIRE CREWS ENGAGE IN FUEL REDUCTION VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PRESCRIBED FIRE AND FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS A RECENT REVIEW OF CALAVERAS CREE UTILIZATION SHOWN AT THE SEVEN OF THE EIGHT CONSOLIDATED CONSERVATION CAMPS IN A PERIOD THAT OF A THREE YEAR AVERAGE FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA CREE SPENT 25% MORE TIME ON CONSERVATION RELATED PROJECT WORK THE MOST SPENT ON FIRE SIGNS. NOT TO THOUSAND TWENTY WAS DEVASTATING AND THAT'S REASON WE DID THE PRIOR THREE YEAR AVERAGE. CALVET HAS YOU CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD CREWS ARE GONNA FIRE CREWS. AND IF THOUSAND TWENTY FIRE SEASON THE ADMINISTRATION ARE GOING TO THE EMERGENCY FUND TO ADD BOTH ADDITIONAL SEASONAL CCC CREW MEMBERS FIRE CREWS IN EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SIX HARPER THE ACT. IS NOT FIRE CREW MEMBERS AS PART OF A FLEXIBLE FIREFIGHTERS SEARCH CAPACITY. IN THIS PROPOSAL CAUGHT FIRES REQUESTING THE STAFF- FOR THE SIXTEEN FIREFIGHTER CREWS THAT WE OPERATED OUT OF SEVEN OF THE CONSERVATION CAMPS THAT HAVE BEEN DEPOPULATED. IS PART OF THE CAMP CONSOLIDATION INCLUDING DEVIL'S GARDEN CHAMBERLAIN CREEK IROC VALLEY VIEW. BASELINE PILOT ROCK AND RAINBOW CAMPS. THESE CREWS WILL BE STAFFED TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK NINE MONTHS A YEAR FROM MARCH FIFTEENTH TO DECEMBER FIFTEENTH- STAFF WITH A FIRE CAPTAIN FIRE APPARATUS ENGINEER AND A MINIMUM OF THIRTEEN SEASONAL FIREFIGHTER ONES. ARE THAT WILL PERFORM FUEL REDUCTION AND FIRE PREVENTION PROJECT WORK WERE NOT ASSIGNED TO EMERGENCY INCIDENTS. THIS MODEL WILL PROVIDE THIRTY ONE ADDITIONAL CREW DAYS OR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS A YEAR WITHIN THAT NINE MONTH FIREFIGHTER CREW THAT ARE TRADITIONAL HAND CREAM MODEL. UTILIZING IT MAY FIRE CREWS AT. TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE DAYS- PARTLY. DUE TO- HOLIDAYS AND VISITS. THAT WE NEED TO. OUR AND MAKE. FIREFIGHTERS WORK AT SEVENTY TWO HOUR SHOW IN WITH THE DAY WEEK COVER CAN YOU OUR DUTY THE BACKFIELD CREE ONCE IT'S CA. AT EMERGE ANSWERED. THIS CAN BE YOU FOR COVERAGE BEHIND THE FIRE COULD COME EMERGE INCIDENT OF THE MERGER RESPONSE THE NEW. STAFFING SIXTEEN FIREFIGHTERS STATEWIDE WILL PROVIDE A CALIFORNIA TO SEARCH THE THIRTY TWO FIREFIGHTING CREWS AT TIMES A CRITICAL NEED IN ADDITION THE FIREFIGHTING CREWS WILL BE STAFFED AGAIN. TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AS IT RELATES TO OUR RELAY. WITH CAL COMES CORPS AS I SAID WE'VE HAD TWELVE YEAR ROUND PARKER'S STAFF STATEWIDE DIVERSE RELATIONSHIP. COOPER AND THE CCC REQUEST AFTER SIX IT TO STAFF- TO TRANSITION SIX EXISTING REIMBURSEMENT CCC CREWS OF THE TYPE ONE FIRE CREWS. WHICH CRUISE AND LAKE TAHOE. TO A DOCTOR'S STYLE HAS. STOCKTON DELTA SORRY ABOUT THAT AND I'VE BEEN IN THE U. PRIOR WILL ITS AREA. IN ADDITION THE PROPOSAL ADDS ANOTHER TWO EXPANSION CRUISED TO THE LOS PINOS CENTER. THE REQUESTED CLUES AN OFFSET OF ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN YEAR ONE AND TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION STARTING YAR TWO FROM THE FOLLANDO CAN. REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT TO REFLECT THAT THE SIX EXISTING REIMBURSEMENT CREWS WILL TRANSITION. TO BE FULLY FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND. POSO ALSO FOR TO STAY SIX CCC. THE WAY TO. EMERGE HERE CAPABILITIES. DURING THE PEAK FIRE. ACTIVITY PERFORM. MANAGEMENT HAZARDOUS WE WHEN THEY NOT THIS I OVER TO INCIDENT. FINALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO. THAT THE AND EQUIPMENT CAN WITHIN PROPOSED ARE CALM OF. BECAUSE IN A QUICK FROM THE DEEP POP CAMPS ARE FROM THOSE EIGHT CONSERVE CAMP AS WELL AS NEW BECAUSE THEY THAT THE OP NEEDS OF CAREERS. THE STRONG WORKING THAT WE HAVE FOR BETWEEN CALPERS. AND CDCR PROVIDE HAND CREWS. TO CONDUCT FIRE SUPPRESSION FUEL REDUCTION VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK RELATED TO- RELATED WORK THAT'S BEEN OUTSTANDING AND CONTINUES TO GROW IN THAT RELATIONSHIP. NOW YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THE L. A. O. I REPORT THAT THEY RECOMMEND. AND SUGGEST A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER BEFORE ACTING ON THIS PROPOSAL AND AS SUCH I'D LIKE TO OFFER THE COMMITTEE SOME ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO CONSIDER. WHEN CONSIDERING THE USE OF AUGMENTED OR MUTUAL AID LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAND CREWS IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE ONLY FOURTEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT TYPE ONE HAND CREWS AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE HAND CREWS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTION FIRST AND FOREMOST. AND REGIONALLY OR STATEWIDE ONLY IF AVAILABLE TO RESPOND ACROSS THE STATE. THE STATE DOES NOT CONTROL THESE RESOURCES. LOCAL GOVERNMENT DAILY RATES ARE HIGHER THAN THE PROPOSAL HERE. WHERE CAL FIRE ESTIMATES ARE DAILY COST OF THE CREW TO BE ELEVEN THOUSAND. EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX DOLLARS A DAY. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT COOPERATORS AND ASSESS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THEIR RESOURCES AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE DOLLARS A DAY TO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS A DAY. AND THAT WAS VERIFIED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SYSTEMS AGREEMENT REIMBURSEMENT INVOICES RECEIVED IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. WHEN LOOKING AT OTHER CREE TYPES IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW CALPERS BEEN WORKING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO BUILD FIRE CREWS BY ADDING ADDITIONAL CCC FIRE CREWS ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL. A GUARD THE POOL OF AVAILABLE NON STATE FIRE RESOURCE IS EXTREMELY LIMITED AND CONSISTS OF THE UNITED STATES FOR SERVICE CREWS THAT ARE CONTROL RESPONSE FROM BOISE IDAHO FOR NATIONAL RESPONSE OUR PRIVATE CONTRACTOR USED CONTRACT COUNTY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE CREWS THAT ARE DESCRIBED. IN RELATION TO OUR LESS COSTLY ALTERNATIVES IT'S IMPORTANT. TO VALUE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH A SIXTY SEVEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THROUGH THAT THAT SOME C. C. C. APPLICANTS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BECOMING FIREFIGHTERS POTENTIAL CORE MEMBERS JOIN THE CCC TO CONDUCT WORK OTHER THAN FIREFIGHTING. FOR MANY OTHER CONSERVATION RELATED OPPORTUNITIES THE CCC REPORTS BOTH EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PUBLIC SERVICE CONSERVATION WORK AS AN EXAMPLE. THE CCC CREWS ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTING MASS VACCINATION SITES FOOD BANKS THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. A REVISION CONTROL AND BERNARD- RESTORATION DEMANDS AND ASSISTING TREE MORTALITY ISSUES IN THE SIERRAS ENDANGERED SPECIES HABITAT AND PROJECTS SUCH. AS THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PRIOR- GRAHAM THANK BE A CALL BY TIME CREWS. THIS HAS I'M MORE THAN YEARS A CARRYING OUT VALUABLE CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT PROJECTS- CALIFORNIA MISSION AND COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IS TO CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THEIR WORK AND SERVICE TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. FINALLY NOT RELATED TO COST. UP A SEASONAL FIREFIGHTER ONE'S BASE SALARY IS 400-010-0404 DOLLARS 250-003-0012 DOLLARS PER MONTH. WORKING EIGHT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY OUR TWENTY EIGHT DAY- WORK PERIOD ENSURING THE STATE IN THE CITIZENS AND VISITORS THAT THEY HAVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE COVERAGE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL ENTER THEIR CAREER AT APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN DOLLARS THIRTY CENTS AN HOUR UP TO EIGHTEEN DOLLARS FORTY CENTS AN HOUR. FINALLY IF- CHAIR BLAME WILL ALLOW ME- A MOMENT ALL ANSWERED A QUESTION FROM A FROM AN EARLIER ASK IF SHE ORDER AND THAT WAS- THE S. SEVENTY I. HELICOPTER FLEET. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE HELICOPTERS- IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF MCCLELLAN ONE AND FINING YOU'RE CHICO ONE YET COLOMBIAN YOUR SONORA. AT TODAY ARE STAFFERS LEAVING IT PICK UP TO ADDITIONAL HELICOPTERS IN COLORADO. THAT WILL BE FLOWN OUT BY THE END OF THE WEEK AFTER THIRTY DAYS OF NEAR SEA LEVEL TESTING. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DO THAT IN COLORADO- IN THOSE TWO HELICOPTERS WILL GO TO HEMET RYAN IN THE RIVERSIDE AREA AND BOGGS. IN THE NAPA AREA. WE WOULD EXPECT TO MORE HELICOPTERS COMING IN IN THE MIDDLE OF FIRE SEASON IF. OUR FIRE SEASON IS IT A AT A SLOW PACE AT THAT MOMENT TIME WE WILL TRAIN CREWS INTO THOSE NEW HELICOPTERS AS WELL- AND CURRENTLY WELL WE DID HAVE SOME INITIAL CO THAT DELAY IS I APPEARS THAT WE ARE ON SCHEDULE. ETCHER BLOOM AND FELLOW MEMBERS WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND PERCENT THAT THIS PROPOSAL TO YOU AND WE'RE HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FELT A LOT OF. AND- A- I'M GONNA SOME TIME TO DIED IT I AND HAVE MORE FOR YOU- AT AT- FUTURE HEARING- BUT OF THE MASK OF MY COLLEAGUES TO FURTHER ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT WELL- YOU REFERENCED- THAT THE L. A. O. HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS TOO- AND- WHEN IT WILL ALLOW THE L. A. O. TO MAKE ITS PRESENTATION NOW. THANK YOU PRIME BROWN WITH L. A. AGAIN- SO WITH REGARD TO THIS PROPOSAL WE DO THINK THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL- PARTICULARLY FOR THE ADDITIONAL FIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY. THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE GIVEN THE DECLINING INMATE CONSERVATION CAMP POPULATION WHICH HAS GONE DOWN BY. ROUGHLY A THOUSAND OVER THE LAST DECADE AND SO THAT REALLYDOES DIMINISH IMPORTANT. RESOURCE FOR- FIRE FIRE PROTECTION AS WELL AS- FUEL PRODUCTION. I'M WE DO THINK THOUGH THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ONGOING GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT. AND THEREFORE IMPORTANT THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE- BROADER GENERAL FUND CONDITIONAL OFFICE AND FINANCE HAS. PROJECTED TO BE- IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN FUTURE YEARS. HI IN ADDITION PROBABLY ALSO WORTH CONSIDERING HOW THIS ALIGNS WITH WHAT YOU ULTIMATELY CHOOSE TO DO ON THE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PACKAGE. AS IS THE PRESENTERS NOTED EARLIER THE FIRE CREW PROVIDE BOTH RESPONSE CAPACITY AS WELL AS PREVENTION MITIGATION- TYPE BENEFITS IN- SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS A PARTICULAR. FOCUS OR INTEREST OF THE COMMITTEE YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER THESE- FIRE CREWS ARE THE BEST WAY TO PROVIDE THOSE ADDITIONAL- PREVENTION MITIGATION ACTIVITY- BENEFITS. OF VERSUS- INVESTING SOME OF THESE DOLLARS IN OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART OF YOUR BURKE RESILIENT PACKAGE THAT YOU ALTERNATELY ADOPT- YOU OTHER POINTS NAY ONE EIGHT EIGHT. AS CHIEF NOTED WE DO THINK THAT YOU THE SPRING ALSO TO WORK WITH THE MINISTRY TO. WHY THERE ARE OFF. TO EXPAND HE CREW THE- IN ADDITION TO OR OR- IN PART REPLACE OF THIS PROPOSAL A PARTLY BECAUSE OF IT IS AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSAL AND- WE KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE A LOT IN RECENT YEARS TO LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS TO EXPAND HAND CREWS. AS SHE TALENTED THE USE OF CONSERVATION CORPS NATIONAL GUARD PAROLEES AND SO WE DO THINK THERE IS VALUE IN USING THE SPRING PROCESS TO LOOK WHETHER. FOR OUR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER THAT'S WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FINDING OTHER WAYS TO EXPAND THE PRO THE- PROGRAM- OR OTHER YOU UTILIZE OTHER. OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS JUST EXAMPLES WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL BUT AGAIN WE THINK YOU CAN JUST BRING PROCESS TO EXPLORE THE- AND AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE RELATIVE COST TRADE OFFS AND- IN PROGRAMMATIC BENEFITS WOULD. BE IS THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT. AND LASTLY REALLY JUST WROTE A PRETTY MINOR TECHNICAL ISSUE IS THAT A VERY SMALL SHARE OF THE PROPOSAL HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. IS FOR- CAL FIRE TO WORK WITH CAL HR TO EXPLORE A NEW CLASSIFICATION- THAT WOULD IDEA WOULD BE POTENTIALLY. IF THEY DIDN'T IF THEY DETERMINE THAT WAS WARRANTED CREATE A NEW CLASSIFICATION FOR THESE CAL FIGHTER FIRE CREWS IN INSTEAD OF USING FIREFIGHTER ONES IN THE FUTURE. WE THINK UNDERTAKING THAT IF THE ANALYSIS IS INVALUABLE WE DON'T DISPUTE THAT IT COULD FOR EXAMPLE- IN THE LONG RUN REDUCE COST IF YOU COULD UTILIZE A- LOWER PAY CLASSIFICATION POTENTIALLY AND ALSO POTENTIALLY EXPAND. THE ELIGIBLE POOL OF INDIVIDUALS THAT COULD FILL THAT THE TRADITION WE JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING REQUEST IT IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT IT WOULD FIND. ESSENTIALLY THREE POSITIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND SO ON THAT ISSUE JUST LIKE THAT COULD YOU HAVE AN OPTION IT WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO. IDENTIFY WITH THE RIGHT LEVEL OF RESOURCES. WOULD BE SHOULD THE AND A LOT OF WANNA MOVE FORWARD THIS FOR. THANK YOU- THAT OF FINANCE COMMENTS. NOTHING THANK YOU THANK YOU CHIEF TYLER AND I HAVE YOUR BACK FOR A MOMENT- ON THIS ISSUE OF- A FIRE CREWS AND THEIR- PREVENTION FUNCTION- AS YOU. ARE A WELL AWARE THE SUB COMMITTEE HAD A- A EARLY HEARING ON FIRE PREVENTION AND- THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED EARLY ACTION. ON. PROVIDING FUNDING FOR FIRE. VENTION MEASURES AND ALL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT WHEN WE GET TO- ISSUE NUMBER FIVE OUT OF WHY NOT- WHY IS THIS THE BEST MIX OF- A NEW RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF PREVENTION. I BELIEVE- IS CHEAP ORDER- MENTION IN HIS OPENING THAT- THAT. IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL OUR VARIOUS CREW TYPES. WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE- THAT FUNCTION AND AS I MENTIONED- THE- THE FIRE CREWS THAT ARE REFERRED TO IN THIS PROPOSAL WHEN NOT ASSIGNED TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE I WILL BE CONTINUING THAT WORK- RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE PRESCRIBED FIRE CREWS OF THE FUEL REDUCTION CREWS THAT ARE. PROPOSED AND- IN EARLY ACTION AND WELFARE RESILIENCE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE TARGET GOALS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- TO BE ABLE TO- IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH- AND PROVIDE A FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE. I THINK A COMBINATION OF THESE RESOURCES- IS. IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S ITS CITIZENS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. THAT GREAT WORK. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE AND- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE NEXT ITEM. ONE NEXT THE. NO WE'RE WE'RE A FORCE RESILIENCE IS GOING TO BE- ISSUE FIVE. YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL PROCEED NOW TO- ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WILL DISCUSS CONTINUING RESOURCES TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM.

WE ARE NOT GOING TO READ OUR MONEY- THIRTY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GOALS- WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS AND- I WOULD LIKE TO- SUGGESTED A REQUEST FOR MORE RESOURCES- PART OF THAT REQUEST FOR MORE RESOURCE SHOULD BE- TO ADDRESS WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO DIFFERENT WITH CAP AND TRADE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REACH- OF THOSE. THOSE IMPORTANT GOALS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- L. A. L. AND- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WERE FOUND WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AT MISS CHANG MENTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE DID REQUIRING US ARE- REPORT- THAT WAS INTENDED TO KIND OF HELP INFORM- AND OPERATIONAL WORKLOAD AND THE NEED FOR ONGOING FUNDING FOR THESE POSITIONS AND THAT WAS JUST- TRANSMITTED LAST NIGHT SO WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THAT. WE WILL REVIEW THE REPORT AND PROVIDE OUR UPDATED COMMENTS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ONCE WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO GET OUT. THANK YOU FINANCE. ZERO EIGHT APART IT'S NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE I KNOW THIS IS- GOING TO CONTAIN SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL. IN THE REPORT SO LET'S GET RIGHT INTO IT. THANKS SO MUCH. YOUR BLOOMING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M I'M WAY CROWFOOT ARE NATURAL RESOURCES SECRETARY- FIRST OF ALL THANKS FOR YOUR STEWARDSHIP. OF OUR ENTIRE AGENCIES BUDGET- WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT ALLOWS US TO MEET THE MISSION OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. SPECIAL THANKS TO YOU CHERRY BLOOM FOR YOUR STEADFASTNESS OVER SO MANY YEARS- WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IS TRULY POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP- IN YOUR LEADERSHIP. I HELPING STEWART IN SHAPE OUR OUR BUDGET THROUGH THE COMMITTEE- BIG BANKS AS WE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU AND YOUR LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE. TO COMBAT THE WILDFIRE CRISIS IN THE STATE. ARE CLEARLY HAS REPORTER ARTICULATED BUILDING OUR RESPONSE CAPACITY. IS ESSENTIAL. VERY PROUD OF THE WORK OF. AND I KNOW WE'RE ALL SO THANKFUL FOR THE COURT COURAGE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE. I YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. I SAY OFTEN THAT WE'RE BLESSED IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE WORLD'S MOST SOPHISTICATED WILDLAND FIREFIGHTING FORCE AND THAT'S TRUE. SO CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESPONSE CAPACITY IS ESSENTIAL. BUT FRANKLY IT'S NOT ENOUGH. HOW WE ARE LIVING THROUGH A REMARKABLE PHENOMENON OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY DATA POINTS. SEVENTEEN OF THE LARGEST TWENTY WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEAR HISTORY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. LAST SUMMER FIVE OF THE SIX LARGEST WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE OR BURNING AT THE SAME TIME. NOW SCIENCE IS CLEAR AYE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE RISKS ARE WORSENING AS A RESULT OF WARMING WINTER AND SUMMER TEMPERATURES. SO WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THAT DECADES OF A POLICY OF FIRE SUPPRESSION- THAT THAT CREATED THESE CONDITIONS THAT ARE NOW BECOMING WORSE AS AS A RESULT. OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND AS WE SAID BEFORE AND WE'RE THANKFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP WE'RE NOT GOING TO STICK OUR HEAD IN THE SAND- ABOUT THE SCIENCE WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE WHICH TELLS US WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO COMBAT THE CRISIS SO IT'S BOTH RESPONSE AND RESILIENCE AND WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT TODAY IS OUR WHAT WE PROPOSE AND WHAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM PROPOSES TO BE A QUANTUM LEAP OF INVESTMENT. IN BUILDING A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE AND BY WILDFIRE RESILIENCE WE ESSENTIALLY MEAN PROACTIVE UP FRONT ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE BEFORE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES EXIST I TO REDUCE THE BOTH THE REST OF THOSE WILDFIRES FROM GETTING SO LARGE AND DANGEROUS BUT ALSO THE THREATS. TO OUR PEOPLE ON OUR PROPERTY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT FROM- THOSE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. AND IF WE THESE. OUTWARDS OUR ACTIONS THEY WE MAKE IS RESILIENCE INVESTMENTS CORRECTLY WE WILL. BETTER PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FIREFIGHTERS. RESTORE AND MAINTAIN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE TO GET MORE PEOPLE I ENGAGED IN THE SOLUTION- TO BUILD OUR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. SO IN A MOENT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IS GOING TO SHARE DETAILS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL UPWARDS OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS I TO IN BASS. COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS THE SECTOR I TO BUILD OUR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED IN PART ON AN ACTION PLAN. THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH MY- PARTNERS INCLUDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ALL MANNER OF STAKEHOLDERS- THAT ACTION PLAN WHICH WAS RELEASED IN JANUARY IS CALLED THE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN. AND IT COMES OUT OUT OF THE WORK OF THE FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE BEGAN. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SO THE BUDGET YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT AND CONSIDER I IS BASED ON THE INPUT. OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME AND BOTH THE ACTION PLAN AND THE BUDGET REFLECTS pDO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AS WE TAKE THE TIME. AND I'LL MENTION THAT THESE PRINCIPLES. I HAVE DEVELOPED AN ELEVATED- IN PART THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY OF LEGISLATORS I HELPING EDUCATE US WHAT'S NEEDED ACROSS THE STATE SO A FEW KEY PRINCIPLES. FIRST A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. NEEDS TO ADDRESS BOTH. BETTER MANAGEMENT OF OUR LANDSCAPES. WHETHER THAT'S OUR PINE FOREST THE SIERRA THE NORTH. FOR THE- OAKWOOD LANE. I IN THE FOOT OF THE VALLEY OR THIS. ENVIRONMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO INVEST MORE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. WHETHER THAT'S- FUEL BREAKS THAT FLOWED ON FIRE COMING IN THE COMMUNITIES. OR HELPING DRIVE ACTIONS INCLUDING EVACUATION PLANNING DEFENSIBLE SPACE HOME HARDENING. SO FAR PERSPECTIVE IT'S NOT A WAR BETWEEN LANDSCAPER FOREST MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY INVESTMENT IF THEN AND- QUITE NUMBER TWO- YOU'LL SEE IN THIS PROPOSAL A PRIORITY ON DRIVING RESOURCES TO REGIONALLY TAILORED SOLUTIONS- WHAT WORKS IN URBAN I SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MAY NOT WORK IN THE RURAL SIERRA NEVADA. WHAT WORKS IN- THIS THE BAY AREA UP MAY NOT WORK OUR AND IN JUST DIFFERENT- THEN WHAT WORKS ON THE NORTH COAST. WE CANNOT INVEST IN A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION FROM SACRAMENTO SO WHAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IS INVESTING MORE IN A REGIONAL PIPELINE A PROJECT THAT ARE DEVELOPED. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEADERS THAT REALLY ADDRESS THE UNIQUE WILDFIRE RISKS THAN ANY PART OF THE STATE. WE'RE ALSO INVESTING IN DEEPENING PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL LOCAL- LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES. SOMETIMES PARTNERSHIPS CAN SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE A TALKING POINT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ESSENTIAL. CERTAINLY WITH THE FEDERAL MANAGEMENT FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT MANAGE 57% OF OUR STATE FORESTS BUT ALSO WITH NUMEROUS TRIBAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT- WE NEED TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING MONEY I'M IN IN CLOSE ALIGNMENT WITH THOSE OTHER LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES AND LEADERS. ONE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN OUR REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT. I SIMPLY PUT WE NEED MORE WORKERS TO DO THIS WORK I'M WILDFIRE RESILIENCE AND WE NEED MORE CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANIES HOW TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GET THIS WORK DONE. AS A RESULT OF A LOT OF OUR INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY RELATED TO UTILITY RELATED WILDFIRES- THERE IS A WE HAVE A DEARTH OF WORK FORCE TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS WORK HAPPEN. SO PART OF OUR OUR PROPOSAL IS INVESTING IN WORKFORCE ACROSS THE STATE AND SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESS SO WE CAN PUT MORE PEOPLE TO WORK ACTUALLY ON ON THIS CRITICAL PRIORITY NOT ONLY BUILDING A RESILIENT BUT HOPING OUR OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND THEN LASTLY SOMETHING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT'S WE NEED TO MORE EFFICIENTLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY DELIVER PROJECTS- WHETHER IT'S EMERGENCY FUEL BREAKS OR LANDSCAPE LEVEL VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ARE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO CUT RED TAPE THAT EXISTS TO GET MORE OF THIS WORK HAPPENING MORE QUICKLY. SO WHEN I BROAD OVERVIEW I WANT TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA MORRIS OUR DEPUTIES. FORCED MANAGEMENT TO OUTLINE OUR PROPOSAL HERE TODAY AND BOTH JESSICA AND I ARE ARE FORCED AYE GLAD TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AFTER HER PRESENTATION. THAT'S GOT. I'M GOING TO SHARE PRESENTATION WITH YOU HERE. AND AND I'M EXCITED TO TALK THROUGH THE STRATEGY HERE FOR WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS GROUND BREAKING IT PROPOSES A BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS AN INCREASE FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR- BUDGET LAST YEAR. TO REALLY INCREASE AND SEARCH OUR CAPACITY TO HIT ALL THREE FRONTS OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE WHILE STILL ADDRESSING UNDERLYING- I UNDER LYING ISSUES AND STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN SLOWING DOWN OUR PACE AND SCALE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES WITH IN THAT BILLION IS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION. OR FOR EARLY ACTION FUNDING THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THIRTY DOLLARS TO ENABLE US TO GET TO WORK NOW BECAUSE THE WILDFIRE DOESN'T FIT NEATLY INTO THE BUDGET CYCLE THE WIND IT'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WEATHER OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO DO THE PREVENTATIVE WORK IS RIGHT NOW AND THIS WINDOW COMES- ONLY YOU KNOW IN IN THE SPRING AND- IN THE WINTER AND SO WE NEED TO BE HAVE HAVE WORK ON THE GROUND NOW. AND CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER SO THERE'S THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION FOR SEARCH DOLLARS. GAS ACTING ACTIVITY STARTED WHILE WE HAVE THE WEATHER OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT I'M SO I WANT TO TALK TALKING THROUGH THE OVERALL STRATEGY THAT SECRETARY CROWFOOT TOUCHED ON AND REALLY DIVE INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT'S PROPOSED. IN THIS BUDGET SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. CALIFORNIA'S WHILE RESILIENCE WE- IS CHEAP THREE. THAT TO BE SIGNED. THIS IS. HARDENING BUILDINGS THAT COULD MEAN. CAN STATE WITH STAN IN THE WORK CASE SOMEONE. COMES THROUGH. ESTABLISHING WINTER INTERFACE FOR T. NO. AND PRESCRIBED. WERE FIRE CAN TAKE A STATE. AND A STATE DURING. FIRE AND WHOLE LANDSCAPE STRATEGY TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY. AND RETURNING. IN AND THE NOT. ECOLO ROLE OF. I'M CAL PLANT. SO WE ARE TRYING ALL OF THESE OUT IN THIS PART AS WELL AS SOME UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES- THAT WILL ALLOW US TO INCREASE THE PACE. ON THE RESILIENT LANDSCAPES RAIMES OUR GOAL IS TO REALLY UTILIZE PRESCRIBED FIRE AND RETURN THE NATURAL ROLE OF FIRE TO THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY- A MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S ECOLOGY INTO FIRE ADAPTED ECOSYSTEM. SOME AREAS ONE OF FIRE RETURN INTERVAL OF THIRTY TO SIXTY YEAR. SOME OF THE STATE ONE OF FIRE RETURN INTERVALS OF TEN TO FIFTEEN BUT MANY AREAS IN THE STATE HAVEN'T SEEN FIRE FOR HUNDRED YEARS. WHICH IS WHAT'S GIVING US THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES. SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET- FIRED BACK ON THE LANDSCAPE A LOT OF THAT MEANS REDUCING THE FUEL LOOK FIRST TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE NATURAL ECOLOGICAL ROLE ACQUIRE. WITH CHALLENGING CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE TYPES OF. A LAND OWNERSHIP ACROSS THE STATE 57% IS OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 40% IS PRIVATELY OWNED AND 3% IS OWNED BY THE STATE. BUT THE WILDFIRE DOESN'T STOP AND JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES STORE STRATEGIES HERE ALLOW TO HAVE A PATCHWORK OF RESILIENCE ON THE LANDSCAPE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE WHOLE ECOSYSTEM. SO WE WORK. AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED DIFFERENT TARGETED PROGRAMS YOU TARGET DIFFERENT TYPES OF LANDSCAPE THAT CAN COME TOGETHER AND GIVE US THAT WHOLE WATERSHED. AND POOL AYE. ECOSYSTEM APPROACH YOU. THERE WERE SOME SO EXAM OF THESE PRO IN REALLY RIGHT UP ARE AT ON EIGHT LAND THIS IS SOME OF MOST BY DIVERSE AND UNIQUE HABITAT IN THE STATE WHICH IS IT IS PROTECT BY PARK AND DEPARTMENT FISHER WILDLIFE WORK CAPACITY OUR STATE ENTITY TO MANAGE OUR LAND FACT. WE'RE ALSO INCREASED FUNDING FOR SMALL FAVORITE 20% OF THE FORCE LAND IN. AND IT MALL OF COURSE LANDOWNER CREATED ON THE COAST AND THE THINK IT'S GIVING THEM A GREAT DOLLARS- AND FUN TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THEIR ON SMALL FAMILY FORCED OF IT'S REALLY TO WHICH SIX HERE WE ALSO HAVE FUNDING- CHIU SUPPORT REFORESTATION PARTNERS- AND WE ALSO FUNDING TO REALLY SUPPORT TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT SO TRY FUNDING SPECIFICALLY. FOR CRIMES TO BE ABLE AYE WHAT THEY WANT DO ON THE LAND IT'S VERY OPEN FOR TRYING TO BE A TO HOW LOT OF FLEX AND- AND EASIER TO GETTING DAHLE- TO THAT CRITICAL AND ALSO PRESS TO BE INFORM TRADITIONAL EAGLE KNOWLEDGE IN OUR PRESS. IT'S ALSO INCLUDES OUR EGGS FOR HEALTH GRANT PARK WHICH KEEPS OUR DAHLE OUT TO GRANT IN THE AND IT'S REALLY OF THE FOUNDING OF OUR APPROACH TO POOREST. REALLY LOOKING AT THE ONE- INTERFACE. MANY OF THE OVERALL CALLED GOVERNOR. DECLARED IN A- BEFORE THE EMERGENCE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND DEPLOYED CALIFORNIA AND THE- GUARD. AND THE CONSERVE CORPS DO THAT WAS THIRTY FIVE EMERGING FUEL FOR ACROSS LANDSCAPE. YES BREAKS PICTURE I AGREE EXAMPLE OF ONE OF HERE WHERE IT'S A SHE AREA- YOU REDUCE THE ON. THERE ARE ALONG ROAD. TO THE DOUBLE A SKI. AWARD TO APPROACH A FIRE. THESE ARE QUITE AND- TOOLS DURING A CATASTROPHIC FIRE TO BE ABLE HELP NOT ONLY POTENTIAL HOLD. LINE OR RIGHT OF FIRE BUT TO ALLOW P. TO STATE I'M HERE THE COP OF THE- OF. FUEL BREAKS ARE DOWN- A DOWN AND DIEGO AND THE IN THEM AND EMPIRE. AND- THE BOTTOM. IS A FEW YOU'LL BREAK IMPAIRED- IN HE CAN'T. WE AS YOU CAN SEE THE TREES RISK BUT THERE STAND THAT WILL BREAK WASN'T EVEN MANNED BY FIRE. AT OR- THE CAN'T ON THE PLANE IN. PROTECT THE TOWN OF STERLING. SO THE STRATEGIC FEEL BREAKS ARE CLOSE AND FUNDING WILL ALLOW CALTRAIN HERE TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE FUEL THEY PUT THE GROUND AS WELL AS GETTING MORE. DAHLE OUT COMMUNITY. TO PUT ST YOU FUEL RIGHT AROUND THERE IN. THE NIGHT AREA IS GOING TO BE V. IS ANYTHING HERE'S ANOTHER PHOTO. THE SPACE AND OUR HOME THIS NEW AREA REALLY LOW AT. COMMUNITY AND HOW HARDENING HOW WE HELP. SERVED BY IF A WILDFIRE THROUGH. YOU CAN SEE IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT. THAT THERE IS- SPACE. THESE HOME. AND AND THESE REALLY. AND ALLOWS A HIGHER PRICE TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT. BETTER AND TWO. A WILD. MORE IMPORTANT OUR IMPORTANT ALSO WHO HARD THIS IS. IN SMALL. FRACTURE FITS ON A TO BE ABLE TO AND- ITS- ARE. DURING WHAT. THE FIRE MARSHAL CHANGED FIRE CODE CORPS. HOME HARDING'S. IN YOUR STREETS YOU FUEL FOR. AND YOUR LAST BUILDING BACK INTO. EIGHT AND SO WE STARTED HOMES IN THE CAMP PERKS. BILL BEFORE. BUILT AFTER-TWO. EIGHT HOW A FIFTY TO. PER SURVIVE RATE WERE THESE PUMP. STANDARDS WHEREAS HOMES BUILT BEFORE HAD A PERCENT SURVIVAL. SO THERE'S A LOT COMMUNITY CAN DO. IN THE WAY TARGET HOME KERR. IS TO ENSURE THAT- THAT WE ARE. AND AN OPPORTUNITY FAMILIES FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO MAKE THESE RECORDS LIKE PUTTING BACK ON THE ADDRESS. CLEANING OUT THE GUTTERS- IN DEFENSE OF SPACE THE- YOUR STAVING AROUND HOME. I'M LOT OF EDUCATE OUTREACH CAN BE DONE SO WE'RE INVESTING IN THE UC FIREFIGHTERS FIRST INCREASING THE OF REACH CAPACITY OF OUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE. PROGRAMS AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS WERE ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT MANY HOMEOWNER CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THESE RECORDS THAT. AND SO WE ARE LAUNCHING A PILOT- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FEMA. MITIGATION FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE STATE INVEST TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE FEDERAL MATCHING WOULD BE POTENTIALLY. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EVEN THAT'S NOT I'M MILLION DOLLARS. TO BE ABLE TO DO YOU KNOW SLOW THOSE RECTOR FOR LOW IN FAMILIES THAT CAN AFFORD IT. AND WITH THESE TOOLS I DO. AND DIRECTOR SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY THAT CAN'T IT WE'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO REACH HIGHER SO. THAT CENTURY LEVEL- WHAT WE BEEN ARE HARD. COMMUNITY I. THREE FOUR THAT YOU CURRENTLY NEED COMMUNITY HOW. WHILE URBAN. AND WE'RE THE SEVERITY OF FIRE ACTUALLY THEY'RE MORE EQUAL WORLD ON THE REVERSE FOR SO YOU. BUT I DON'T THAT WE'VE BEEN. SEVERAL APPS THAT HAVE BEEN SLOWING THAT. ONE OF THE MAJOR ONE IS GETTING WORK FOR CREW AND BUSINESS NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO. UP TO BE ABLE TO HIRE THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACT DO THE WORK. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS. AND IS AS CAN SEE THESE THE INSIDE SLASH PILES THIS IS A- OF A- I WAS STYLE OF ANTI IF YOU LOOK IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER THAT IS. AND THE FOR SERVICE SEVERAL YEARS AGO GET ASK ME THAT THEY WERE ABOUT FORTY OF SLASHED BY. IN THE TOP WILL BE ALONE TO. WAYS TO JUST OF THIS WOULD BE BY A IS COOL. INCREASE BUSINESS ARE THAT EVEN SENSE. SO ONE OF THE A- WE PROPOSE IS CLIMATE. FUNDS WHICH HELP CREATE- AND- WERE AT LOWING LENDING FOR STARTING UP. IN IS BOTH IN. AND NOT TRADITIONAL SECTORS SO BUSINESSES ARE. SAWMILLS TO. I THINK HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE TO THIS AND WORK IN. I DON'T FEEL THAT YESTERDAY BE ABLE TO A FLAT STYLE LIKE THE ONE USED. AND TURN IT INTO. A BY DIESEL RATHER THAN OPEN I OVER AT AND HAVING THAT CARD GET REALLY YEAH. THERE'S ALSO A IN HERE THE WERE PUT. THAT WE ALLOW US TO BE TO TRY A LARGE BUSINESS. SO LIKE CROSS MEANING TIMBER WHICH SHE A SMALLER. ONE LIKE YOU THANK YOU OFTEN ENDING UP CLASS I. AND TURNING IT A STEEL AND CONCRETE EQUIVALENT I'M BUILDINGS AND CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE JUST. TO A UP TO EIGHTEEN. WHICH MAKES VERY. IN BYRON- BEFORE HE'S- NEW. WHICH IS THAT- IT WHICH IS THAT PROGRAMMATIC CALAVERAS COUNTY AND NOW THE ENTIRE SIERRA THAT PARTNERS WITH TRYING. TO TREATING TRIBAL MEMBERS IN A PRESCRIBED FIRE YOUR ACTION HE AND CREWS SO THAT THEY CAN MANAGE THEIR OWN LAND THEMSELVES WE SAW THIS PROGRAM ACTUALLY REDUCE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ON THAT HELLO T. TRIBE UP IN ALBANY COUNTY BY ALONE. ANOTHER EIGHT TRIBES PARTICIPATING THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA AND THEY ARE GETTING EMPLOYED BY MANY OF THESE- GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT ON THE GROUND. AND THE FUEL REDUCTION WORK THAT WE ARE DOING. IN ADDITION TO THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND THE NEED FOR A BUSINESS INVESTMENT IN THIS SECTOR THERE'S- SEVERAL OTHER UNDERLYING ISSUES ONE IS WE'RE REALLY WORKING ON- STREAMLINING PERMITTING WE HAVE CREATED. A FAST TRACK FOR- BY DOING A PRE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS ON TWENTY MILLION ACRES THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE AND THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS- TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW WATER BOARDS. TO BE ABLE TO. THINK THEIR PERMITS WITH OUR FASTER SEQUEL PROCESS AND BRING THE SEQUEL PROCESS DOWN TO ABOUT TWO MONTHS. AND WHEN GRANT YOU SUPPLY FOR THE PERMIT- THEY GET. THIRSTY QUIET GET THEIR- CDFW ADD THEIR FISH AND WILDLIFE IS COVERED UNDER WATER BOARDS ARE COVERED. SO WE'RE CREATING FASTER TRACKS ON PERMITTING AND FINALLY ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL AREAS IS THAT WE ARE GROUNDING BASED IN SCIENCE. SO REALLY INVESTING IN SCIENCE- AND DATA TECHNOLOGY WE ARE ENSURING THAT WE ARE IMPROVING OUR MODELS. AND OUR MODELING WERE. DOING PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS AND SAPPHIRE MODELING SO THAT WE ARE DESIGNING ALL OF THESE WATERSHED SCALE APPROACHES. AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. BLUSTERY I WANT TO MENTION AND THEN WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS IS HOW THIS ALL FITS INTO THE REGIONAL STRATEGY ONE OF THE AREAS IN THIS BUDGET IS AN EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM. THIS THIS BILL THREE COLLABORATIVES ALL THE STATE TO TABLE. FROM FEDERAL PARTNERS TO TRY TO PARTNER Q. A LOCAL AND- TO LOOK SMALL WHEN OWNERS- AND IT DOES LANDOWNER. BRING THEM ALL TO THE TO DESIGN IT THAT WAY FOR ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN HOW. MANY OF THE- COLLABORATIVELY RECEIVED GRANT. FROM OUR TO BUY A TO PASS PROGRAM. HOWEVER THEY OFTEN LACK THE DOLLARS TO DO NEED TO REACH SCALE WATER SCALE. TO BE ABLE TO USE THE SCIENCE THAT WE'RE GETTING TO DESIGN THEIR TIRE STRATEGIES ANOTHER ED STOCK IN GETTING PROJECTS COURT SHOVEL READY GETTING PROJECTS- REVIEW FOR THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS IN GETTING THAT DONE FASTER. SO WE HAVE INVESTIGATED IT AT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING FOR THE REGIONAL PORTION FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM TO EXPAND THESE COLLABORATIVE. ROUTE THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM PLANNING DOLLARS PROJECT PREPARATION DOLLARS TO DEPARTMENT. PLANS CAN BE. DEAR THEN THE GRANT DOLLARS THAT YOU SEE THE ENTIRE BUDGET PROPOSED. GOING FORWARD THAT THEY THEN FINE THE- GREAT- THESE ENTIRE REGIONAL. COMPLETELY SO WE ARE THREE TO WITH YOU ON THE STATE SO MUCH FOR. THIS BUDGET PER AND WORKS TO BE YOUR- IN HOW CALIFORNIA BECOME. AND RESILIENCE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE. AT THE- REPORT I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE HAVE AFTER QUESTIONS THAT ARE ALLOWED WE HEAR FROM THE- L. OF THE L. A. PRISON. ON ITEM IS. TO HELP ANSWER SOME OF THE- THAT- ARE ANTICIPATED SO- I WOULD BE- MISTER BROWN. YES THANK YOU UPRIGHT CONTRACT WITH THE L. A. AGAIN THANK YOU- OUR OFFICE LAST MONTH IT OUT TO REPORT IS- SUMMARIZING DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE RESILIENCE PACKAGE OF PRESENTED THE FIRST REPORT OF THE ONE THAT'LL BE SPEAKING FROM TODAY WHICH PROVIDES KIND OF OUR OVERARCHING COMMENT BUT WE DO HAVE A SECOND REPORTERS WELL THAT. SHOULD BE A HELPFUL REFERENCE WE THINK FOR THE COMMITTEE WHICH HAD MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON EACH OF THE TWO DOZEN OR SO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT MAKE UP THE PACKAGE. ON SO A FEW HIGH LEVEL ISSUES FOR YOU TO CONSIDER I THINK FIRST OF ALL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS- THERE'S A LOT IN THIS PACKAGE IT IS WORTH YOUR CONSIDERATION AS SECRETARY CROWFOOT DISCUSSED HE LAST YEAR LAST COUPLE YEARS LAST COUPLE DECADES HAVE BEEN AMONG THE WORST IN TERMS OF FIRE DAMAGE AND FIRE SEVERITY- IN THE STATE'S RECORDED HISTORY AND SO WE THINK THAT PACKAGE DOES BUILD ON ACTIONS THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION TAKEN IN PRIOR YEARS SUCH AS- THE ADOPTION OF SB NINE A ONE TO. EXPAND PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES THAT VERY MERITED AND I THINK AS WELL THAT HAVE A PACKAGE WITH A MIX OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES MAKE SENSE OF THE RANGE OF CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FIRE- WILDFIRE PROBLEM AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES SPECIFIC. TO THEM AND SO HAVING A- THE PACKAGE THE A- PARTICULAR TIME FOR THEM TO. FOR EXAMPLE ALL OUR EGGS ONE- AND SO WE THINK ADMINISTRATION PACKAGE PROVIDE YOU A REASONABLE TO. IN LOOKING FORWARD TO A BROADER WILDFIRE REDUCTION STRATEGY- THAT SAID THIS ISN'T THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD STRUCTURE A PACKAGE AND SO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST IT IS LOOKING AT THE ONE TIME NATURE OF THE GENERAL FUND PROPOSED SO IN TOTAL SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OF THE BILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSED TO BE FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IN A ONE TIME NATURE NOW IN MANY CASES THOSE ONE TIME DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT OVER MULTIPLE YEARS OF THE PROJECT TAKE. MULTIPLE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT AND DEVELOP- THAT SAID EVEN WITH THE SCALE OF. THIS PACKAGE- THAT THE SCALE O THE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA IS OF COURSE MUCH LARGER WHETHER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE- TENS OF MILLIONS OF ACRES OF FOREST LAND THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT FOR THE- MILLIONS OF HOMES IN THE MOVIE THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM HARDENING. THIS FUNDING PACKAGE WILL ONLY ADDRESS A RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF THE IDENTIFIED PROBLEM. AND SO WE THINK ONE IMPORTANT. WHAT IT WOULD WE THINK WE ARE AT THE MINISTRY. READ THE PROPOSING ONE GENERAL FUND IT BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA. BUDGET PROPOSAL DO WE THINK THAT UNDERSTANDABLE BUT WE DO THINK THAT DOES IMPLY THAT THERE'S VALUE IN THE SPRING AND IN FUTURE MONTHS THE- H. INTIMIDATION WORKING TOGETHER TO. THINK ABOUT WHAT A LONGER TERM STRATEGY IS BEYOND THIS BILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER ACTUALLY SUCH A FAMILIAR DOCKS. THE NEXT ISSUE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WAS THE- EARLY ACTION PROPOSAL THAT WAS DISCUSSED AT THE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION OF THE BILLION DOLLARS THAT PROPOSED FOR. FUNDING IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- JUST AS A BIT OF CONTACT OUR OFFICE IS A LITTLE BIT WARY ABOUT EARLY ACTION WITHOUT A VERY STRONG RATIONALE. IN THAT EARLY JUST BECAUSE IN PARTICULARLY. WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL FUND- APPROVING THOSE DOLLARS NOW TAKE THEM OFF THE TABLE IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING YOUR BROADER TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET- PRIORITIES- THAT THERE. WILL BE DO YOU THINK THERE ARE SOME REAL NATIONAL FOR ADOPTING SOME EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS ONE IS WITH RESPECT TO THE G. JAR AFTER. FINDING THAT PROPOSED THE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS INTENDED TO BRING TOTAL GDR FUNDING BACK TO THE LEVEL. IDENTIFIED AT THE PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND SB NINE OH ONE- THE FUNNY WITHOUT FULLY PROVIDED THE CURRENT BUDGET ACT BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CAP AND TRADE REVENUES. I KNOW YOU'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL LATER IN THIS CARE ACT THANK. ON THE OTHER CASES THAT WHICH WE THINK THE MESSAGING COULD MAKE THAT IT. WOULD MAKE IT. CONCEPTUALLY THAT IF WE CAN PROVIDE EARLY ACTION IF WE CAN PROVIDE A FEW EXTRA MONTHS OF TIME. THAT MAY BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. I CERTAIN PROJECTS BEING IN. IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT WILD SHE'D OR EVEN THE TWO TWENTY. FIRE SEASON AND WE THINK THE ADDITIONAL SAFETY BENEFITS THAT COULD PROVIDE. COULD MERIT CONSIDERATION OF EARLY ACTION ADOPTION. ONE CONCERN WE HAVE THERE IS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED TIMELINE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS. TO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN FACT THE- INITIATION EXPECTS A CERTAIN NUMBER PROJECT NUMBER OF ACRES TO BE TREATED ON THOSE TIMELINES IN ADVANCE OF US. THE FIRE SCENE SO WE REQUESTED THAT- EXERTION. WILL PROVIDE THAT SOON AND WHEN THEY DO WILL CERTAINLY SHARE THAT WITH THEM. WITH THE COMMITTEE. BUT THE NEXT ISSUE WE SUGGEST THAT YOU THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT USING THIS BRAND EVEN BEYOND THE EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS ARE USING THE REMAIN OF THE SPRING PROCESS. TO EXPLORE WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMATIC OR FUNDING OPTIONS TO. COMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED PACKAGE WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL BUT WE NOTE THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN- THE CURRENT PACKAGE RELIES. VERY MUCH ON EXISTING STATE PREVENTED OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT OTHER PROGRAMS- IDEAS THAT MAYBE LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS- DIFFERENT ADVOCACY GROUPS AND OTHER GROUPS WE HAVE ALL THE WAY TO SUPPLEMENT THIS. THIS PACKAGE AND THEN SIMILARLY IT PARTICULARLY THINKING ABOUT THE LONGER TERM STRATEGY THAT OU MAY WANT. TO EMPLOY- IF TRYING TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL FUNDING OPTIONS THAT COULD A SUPPORT SOME OF THE ONGOING. ONGOING NEEDS OR DEMANDS. D. NATURALLY SHE LEFT PROVIDE THE THEN ONE IS A KNOW THAT THEIR ARE CASES WHEN WE WENT THROUGH EACH OF THE- TWO DOZEN OR SO PROGRAMS IN THE PAC ACHETER SEVERAL CASES WHERE. WE WERE LOOKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ON IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO CHOOSE FROM THE EARLY ACTION ISSUES IDENTIFIED OR PROJECTED OUTCOMES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION EXECUTIVE EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE WITH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE- COULD REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE I WAS SO THAT YOU CAN EVALUATE WHETHER THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE IS DESIGNED TO MEET YOUR YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY NEED AND SO WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE THE MADE OF THE SPRING PROCESS. TO TRY DIRECTED INDUSTRY AND PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN DETAIL. LASTLY ONE OF PACKAGE DO IT. WE SUGGEST THAT BE IMPORTANT TO BUILD IN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THIS IS PARTLY TO HOLD ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR DELIVERING ON THIS VERY LARGE FUNDING PACKAGE WHATEVER PACKAGE YOU ADOPT. A BOOK PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT- WEEK WE THINK HAVING SOME. ABOUT FORTY REQUIREMENTS WILL HELP INFORM YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL IN FUTURE YEARS. I AND HELP GUIDE HOW WE SHOULD AND IN THE FUTURE. FOR FUNDING AT TO TARGET THE MOST AFFECTED PROGRAMS INTERMITTENTLY IN SOME OF THOSE- ROBUST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WOULD WOULD BE VALUABLE IN THE FUTURE- WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- LET ME. OPEN UP BUT- THE TO- IF I MIGHT WITH A- A COMMENT- WELL FIRST A- GRATITUDE TO- THIS IS INDEED THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT- AMOUNTS OF MONEY PROPOSED TO- A BY ANY GOVERNOR- BUT CERTAINLY BY A GOVERNOR NEWSOM- FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. COMES IN THE WAKE OF THE WORST YEAR WE'VE SEEN IF I COULD FRANKLY WAVE A MAGIC WAND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I WOULD WANT TO TRY AND ALLOCATE WOULD BE FAR MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY- A SIGNIFICANT AND WELCOME INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING. FOR PREVENTION AND ON THE SUBJECT OF PREVENTION PREVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO A TERRIBLE JOB OF ON A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES AND- THE DEVASTATION THAT WE'VE SEEN IN WILDFIRE OVER THE LAST DECADE. OF IS PREVENTABLE- HAD WE HAD A LONG TERM STRATEGY LONG AGO IN PLACE WE WOULD HAVE SEEN MUCH REDUCED. DEVASTATION AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST DECADE- BUT IT'S NOT JUST WILDFIRE ON HEALTHCARE AND DISEASE- ON HOMELESSNESS. HAVE WE HAVE THE FORESIGHT TO OF I SPEND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON PREVENTION WE WOULD HAVE TODAY LESS ST HOMELESSNESS WE WOULD HAVE IN THE HEALTHCARE ARENA FOR EXAMPLE FAR LESS RAMPANT. TYPE TWO DIABETES. TOTALLY PREVENTABLE DISEASE- AND WE DO VERY LITTLE TOO- TO INTERCEDE AND OF COURSE ON WILDFIRE SO THIS IS THE EXTREMELY- OF WELCOME- VIDAK A TOPIC OF- EARLY ACTION IS NOW- BEEN RAISED AND- I KNOW THAT- MANY OF YOU. MAY HAVE TUNED IN TO OUR COUNTERPART TED THE SENATE SAID- SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER TWO HEARING YESTERDAY AND SAW AND HEARD ABOUT THEIR EARLY ACTION WILDFIRE PLAN- AGAIN THE NOTION OF EARLY ACTION ORIGINATED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO AND TO GRATEFUL FOR. HIS UP A PROPOSAL BUT I'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI THE CHAIR OF US SENATE SUB TO ON WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN EARLY ACTION FOR WILDFIRE FUNDING AND IN GENERAL WERE. IN AGREEMENT THAT- THIS IS A PRESSING ISSUE THAT MERITS ADDITIONAL FUNDING HOWEVER- AT THIS POINT I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE SENATE'S APPROACH AND EXCLUSIVELY USING GENERAL FUND MONEY- COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OTHERS WILL NOTE THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN- CONTAINS A LOT OF GIGI R. F. MONEY AND SOME GENERAL FUND- I ALSO. WANT TO COMMENT THAT WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT- IN SB NINE OH ONE TO EXPAND TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN GIGI R. F. FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION PURPOSES AND I THINK IT'S PRUDENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STAY VERY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT EVERY DOLLAR OF THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE HELPED US TO GET STARTED ON FIRE PREVENTION WORK AS MUCH IN ADVANCE OF THE UPCOMING FIRE SEASON AS POSSIBLE AND SO I'M APPROACHING THE CONVERSATION- THAT WERE HAVING BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES WITH TWO PRINCIPLES IN MIND. THE FIRST IS THAT THE FUNDING HAS TO GO TOWARDS FIRE PREVENTION AND SECOND THE ENTITY RECEIVING THE FONT OF FUNDING MUST BE ABLE TO USE THE FUNDING IMMEDIATELY IN THE VERY VERY NEAR. I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY ACTION PROVIDE PROPOSAL PROVIDES US WITH A GREAT STARTING POINT MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROPOSED FOR FUNDING IN THAT PLAN THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT- OF THIS MORNING OUR PROGRAMS THAT WE FUNDED IN THE PAST THEY ARE- IN- A FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES SHOVEL READY READY TO GO THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF EARLY ACTION THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO RAPIDLY USE AND DEPLOY FUNDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT'S WHAT EARLY ACTION IS ALL ABOUT. IN ORDER TO GET AHEAD OF THE UPCOMING WILDFIRE SEASON WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE SENATE ON THIS AND- TO ENSURE THOUGHTFUL EARLY ACTION WILDFIRE PACKAGE AND I INVITE YOU OVER- COMMENTS NOT NECESSARILY HERE- ON THE DICE BUT HAD- HAPPY TO RECEIVE FOR A BI OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND INCORPORATE THE MINUTES MUCH AS POSSIBLE NOW. HAVING SAID THAT- I'M NOT- IT WOULD BE- MR CROWFOOT OR SOMEONE ELSE BUT- THE ISSUE OF WHETHER- THIS OF FUNDING IS ONGOING OR NOT I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT ONE WE ARE CLEARLY NOT GOING TO- I DO THE PREVENTION WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO SIMPLY BY DOING WORK THIS YEAR TESTS HAVE TO BE AN ONGOING. EFFORT PROBABLY OVER A DECADE THERE'S NOT THAT MANY YEARS AND THE- SO WHAT CAN YOU UP PLEASE RESPOND TO. THE ISSUE OF WHAT THE INTENTIONS ARE HERE AND HOW MUCH OF THE CURRENT PACKAGE IS INTENDED TO BE ONGOING. YEAH OUT IN JUST A MOMENT I'LL THANK YOU CHAIR I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA BUT I THINK BROADLY SPEAKING WE RECOGNIZE THAT. WE CAN'T. FIND ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECTS OR AS JESSICA LIKES TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW RANDOM ACTS OF. OF A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE WE HAVE TO ENABLE REGIONS TO DEVELOP PIPELINE OF PROJECTS AND THEN FUND THOSE PIPELINE PROJECTS. THE GOOD NEWS IS- WE PROPOSE A STRUCTURE WITHIN THIS- BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS LARGELY QUOTE UNQUOTE ONE TIME FUNDING TO BE SPENT OVER A SERIES OF YEARS ACTUALLY ENABLE THOSE ARE PROJECTS TO BEGIN IN THE PIPELINE OR CONTINUE IN THE PIPELINE AND GET FUNDED OVER SEVERAL YEARS. SO CATHOLIC I CAN YOU TALK ABOUT- MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO- SO WHAT INNOVATIVE ABOUT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS THAT MANY OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE PROPOSED BUDGET YEAR- ARE DESIGNED TO HAVE EIGHTY FIVE TO SEVEN YEAR EXPENDITURE WINDOW. SO THE PROGRAMS WITHIN STATE PARKS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO CONSERVANCY SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO PUT A SURGE- DOLLARS ON- ON THE LANDSCAPE AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TAKE THOSE PROGRAMS. START TO FINISH OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS WE NEED MORE TIME FUNDING IS THAT IT GETS SPENT ON- INFRASTRUCTURE OR A ONE TIME ACQUISITION WHEREAS WHAT WE ARE DOING BY HAVING A LONGER SPENDING FOR RICIN WITH ONE TIME DOLLARS. WE ARE ESSENTIALLY ENABLING US TO CREATE A PROGRAM THAT WILL ACTUALLY DELIVER NOT JUST PHASE ONE- AID FIRE SCIENCE PROJECT BUT ACTUALLY NEEDS HIGHER- BE ENTIRE PIPELINE TO GET FUNDED START TO FINISH. WHAT THAT DOES IS ALSO ENABLES US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE- PREDICTABILITY- SO THE WORKERS THAT WE HIRED THE CONTRACTORS THAT WE HIRE IN THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THERE BECOMES A PREDICTABILITY THAT THIS PRODUCT BUT PROGRAMMING IS GOING TO BE ON THE GROUND IN THEIR COMMUNITY. FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE BEING ENTIRE WATERSHED PROJECT AND THEY CAN THEN DELIVER WITH THAT SO WELL THIS IS A ONE TIME FUNDING- WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE INNOVATIVE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO COME UP WITH AN APPROACH THAT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO CREATE MORE ROBUST AND ADORING- THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A DISCREET START TO FINISH- WE AT ONE TIME FUNDING. THANK YOU A APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO FIRE PREVENTION AND I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS ON THE ONE TIME FUNDING VERSES ON GOING FUNDING WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE FOR WHICH EXPENDITURES OR EARLY ACTIONS I KNOW THAT WE HEARD. A LITTLE BIT FROM THE L. A. O. ON SOME OF THE RATIONALE- FOR EARLY ACTION PROGRAMS- BUT WHAT WILL WE LOSE OUT ON BY WAITING TO APPROPRIATE. THESE FUNDS UNTIL JUNE. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THAT QUESTION THE REACTION DOLLARS ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON- ON THREE CORE CRITERIA THE NUMBER ONE IN THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE REALLY ACTIVITIES THAT WE NEED TO GET STARTED NOW TO BE ABLE TO GAIN A FIRE SEASON. AND AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE EXPECTATIONS SOME OF THESE WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO SEARCH EXISTING ACTIVITIES ON THE GROUND THAT WE CAN COMPLETE BEFORE FIRE SEASON TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MOST PROJECTS AROUND FIRE RESILIENCE- GO START TO FINISH THEY TAKE EIGHT TO TEN MONTHS SOMETIMES LONGER BUT THERE ARE ONLY CERTAIN WINDOWS WITHIN. A LONG EIGHT SPEND MUCH TIME TIMELINE THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET THIS WORK DONE JUST STARTING IN MARCH RATHER THAN JUNE ALLOWS THOSE PROJECTS TO FINISH IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO RATHER IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO IT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO GAIN- AND A TIRE FIRE SEASON OUT OF THESE- FUNDING OUT OF THESE DOLLARS AND CREATE THAT BUYERS MIGHT SOON ARE YOU'RE ALSO ACTIVITIES THAT WE ARE PROPOSED IN THERE SUCH AS THE HOME HARDENING. I'M PROGRAM WITH PROPOSED FOR EARLY ACTION THAT IS PROPOSED SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT PROGRAM STARTED GETTING THE FEMA MATCH WHILE THE FEMA MAPS WINDOW. IS AVAILABLE- TO GET THREE TO ONE FUNDING OUT OF THAT EVEN THOUGH THAT PROP PROGRAM WILL HAVE EVEN LONGER A LARGE AND THEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF THE EARLY ACTION. IS DESIGNS- TO BACKFILL- WHAT WAS THE APPROPRIATION FROM. EUROPE WERE AND I FIND WE ONLY RECEIVED TWENTY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OF OUR- TYPICAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION APPROPRIATION IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THIS YEAR. WE WANT TO COMPLETE THAT SO THOSE. ACTIVITIES CAN GET ON THE GROUND AND MOVING. K. YOU I HAVE ONE QUESTION. YOU KNOW I NOTICE THAT CAN. GRAY PRO- HAVE NOT PER. MUCH FUNDING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I'M REFERRING TO THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS IN THE HEALTHY FOREST GRANTS- WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ADDRESS THIS. WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU THOSE NUMBERS- AND AS A CALIFORNIA RECEIVED OUR- THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED ABOUT- 3235% OF THE GRANTS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 35240% OF THE GRANT- JUST SO YOU HAVE A SENSE THEY- THEY GET. OUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE ABOUT 30% OF THE GRANT APPLICATIONS TO REALLY THE LIMITATION AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN TERMS OF FUNDING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S REALLY BASED ON B. SCALE APPLICATIONS THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING- RATHER THAN. RATHER THAN A LACK OF DOLLARS- AND WE CAN GET YOU THE SPECIFIC DOLLARS- YOU GOT TO TALK THAT THROUGH. I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT YEAH PLEASE SEND. THOSE TO MY OFFICE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY I JUST MIGHT MENTION THAT HAVE JUST. I PART OF IT PART OF OUR DOES TO REALLY INVEST IN THESE REGIONAL PLANS- AND ITS REGIONAL PRIORITIES IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY REGION IS ACTUALLY BEING AS PROACTIVE THAT WANTS TO BE OR CAN BE. GOING AFTER THAT FUNDING SO WE'RE VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO ENSURING THERE'S- THERE'S A REPRESENTATIVE AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO GET THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT FOLLOWED BY MISS FRIEDMAN. SECRETARY CROWFOOT CROWFOOT- I APPRECIATED YOUR EARLY COMMENTS- THAT IDENTIFIED SOME IMPORTANT THINGS THAT IN FIRE PREVENTION- IS. SORT OF A NEW AREA FOR EVERYBODY TO BE FOCUSED ON- SO WITH THAT I WISH I APPRECIATED THAT YOU WERE SENSITIVE TO ISSUES LIKE A WE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW INDUSTRIES AND NEW NEW COMPANIES TO DO THIS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A SIMPLE EASY ANSWER FOR THIS- SO WITH YOUR- SENSITIVITY ON ON AND ALSO TRYING TO GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK- TO TRY TO HAVE THESE PROJECTS NOT BE SO EXPENSIVE- I APPRECIATE THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP. WHAT I HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP FOR US ARE TWO THINGS THAT WILL BE HELPFUL IN THE LONG RUN TO CONTINUE TO FUND AND THAT IS IDENTIFY SPECIFICALLY THE BENEFITS OF THESE VARIOUS PROJECTS SO YOU CAN COME BACK AND IDENTIFY- HOW THAT PARTICULAR. EFFORT DECREASE FIRE RISK WHAT THE PROFESSIONAL SAY OR IF A FIRE BROKE OUT WHAT THE IMPACTS WORK BUT THE OTHER THING IS IF THERE IS A REQUEST TO USE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS YOU ALSO IDENTIFY WHAT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GAINS ARE FROM THIS PROGRAM. DOESN'T IN MY MIND B. TWO ESSENTIAL THINGS AND IF YOU AS YOU'RE STARTING UP IF YOU'RE FOCUSED AND PAY ATTENTION ON THOSE IT MAY BE EASIER FOR YOU TO QUALIFY THOSE FOR US AND SO THAT'S MY REQUEST AND I HOPE IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. FOR SO LONG RUN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I DON'T REALLY THE VERY. I'M SORRY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGREEMENT REVIEW. THERE THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT'S NOT AWKWARD. YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE IMAGES QUICKLY SORRY I WAS ABLE TO SECRETARY GO AHEAD AND FINISH HIS GO AHEAD MAKE YOUR COMMENT. GO AHEAD WITH YEAH I JUST WANTED TO. THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE POINT AND IT'S VERY WELL TAKEN- THERE IS OPS REALLY GOOD WORK UNDERWAY ENSURING THAT OUR FOREST RESILIENCE INVESTMENT ACTUALLY GET MEASURED ACCORDING TO OUR CLIMATE GOALS. YOU KNOW WE NEED OUR FORESTS TO BE AND WE NEED OUR LANDSCAPES I SHOULD SAY TO BE I THINK- AND THAT ABSORBER OF CARBON POLLUTION. AND UNFORTUNATELY DURING THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THEY'VE BEEN A SOURCE. OF MORE CARBON POLLUTION SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR REQUEST AND WE WILL WORK TO RESPOND TO THAT TO MAKE SURE WE COME BACK- WITH MEASURABLE. I INFORMATION ON THE BENEFITS. THANK YOU FIRST I WANT TO. JUST TELL YOU HOW. GRATIFIED IN AND OUT YOU KNOW EXCITED I AM TO SEE THIS LAN GOING FORWARD AND TO START TO BE FUNDED. I WANT TO COMMEND SECRETARY CRAWFORD AND HIS TEAM FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN ABSOLUTELY TO CALL OUT GOVERNOR NEWSOM. AND HIS VISION FOR SHIFTING RESOURCES WHERE THEY NEED TO BE SHIFTED INTO PREVENTION- TO MEET THIS NEW NORMAL. OF OUR OUR NEW CLIMATE AND CHANGING CLIMATE AND I FEEL LIKE THIS. PACKAGE REALLY- ENCOMPASSES UGH FIRE IN A VERY HOLISTIC WAY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WATERSHEDS AND IMPACTS ON WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY IN AND EVERYTHING THAT REALLY- IS IMPACTED BY BY THE WILDFIRES- SO IT'S NICE TO SEE IT LOOKED AT HOLISTICALLY SO THAT ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AREN'T TRAMPLED ON AS WE SOMETIMES SEEN IN THE PAST YOU KNOW- SO THAT THEY'RE ALL RESPECTED AND GIVEN THEIR PROPER PLACE SO I I'M- REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT ARE. THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT THE MECHANIC SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT I WANT TO JUST UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THIS SO. THE PRESCRIBED FIRE WE KNOW WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF DATA AND DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE AND- YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULTIES AS WELL OF UTILIZING IT. SO THE FIRST MINUTE TREAT A MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE REPORT RECOMMENDED ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAINING CENTER. AND DEVELOPMENT SO THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW QUALIFIED TO DO THIS WORK AND MORE OF THEM. BECAUSE PRESCRIBED FIRES BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF. KIND OF HURDLES OF FULLY IMPLEMENTING IT SO. YOU KNOW I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE RAMPED UP INTO AREAS WHERE WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. SO THEY ALSO RECOMMENDED DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATED PRESCRIBE BOB COULD PRESCRIBE BURN PERMIT. AND I'M WONDERING IF THE EXPENDITURE PLAN COVERS THE COST OF BEGINNING ALL OF THAT WORK. AND TANGENTIALLY A LOT OF THE FIRE EXPERTS ALSO TALK ABOUT HAVING BERMAN BOSSES THAT ARE EXPERIENCED- AND SO I'M WONDERING ABOUT KIND OF HOW WE DEVELOP HOW WE GET ALL THIS GOING BECAUSE- WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR IT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT IT SO. IN THE BUDGET IS ALL IS BLUE OR THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES CONSIDERED AN FUNDED. THE NEXT ONE QUESTION I'M GONNA TURN IT JUST AGAIN JUST A MOMENT I WANTED TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU KNOW PRESCRIBED FIRE IS A- IS A PRACTICE THAT OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN USING FOR. SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. AND OSTALIH AND IRONICALLY IT WAS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN YOU KNOW DECADES SOUTH ACTUALLY RESTRICTED THOSE PRESCRIBED BURNING PRACTICES SO. AMONG ALL OVER DOING ON PRESCRIBED BURNING A LOT OF IT IS LEARNING FROM. OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS. BUT JESSICA CAN YOU TALK WE WE'VE WE'VE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS BARRIERS THAT WE NEED TO REMOVE TO ACTUALLY GET MORE PRESCRIBED FIRE ON THE LAND. CAN YOU TALK WITH DIRECTLY ABOUT WHERE OUR INVESTMENTS ARE FOCUSED- IN IN THIS PROPOSAL ON REMOVING THOSE BARRIERS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO WHAT WE'VE WE'RE BUILDING OUT SOME INVESTMENTS WE MADE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR SOME CAL FIRE HAS INCREASED ITS PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM. IT'S PAST TRAINING PROGRAM AND ITS PRESCRIBED FIRE CREWS SO OUR OWN IN HOUSE WORKFORCE. IS EXPANDING DRAMATICALLY- I'M MORE ALSO PUTTING THESE OF COURSE RESILIENCE DOLLARS WHICH ARE AND- WHICH ARE ARE REALLY CAN'T BE FOCUSED ON PRESCRIBED FIRE. THERE'S FUNDING HERE FOR THE AIRPORTS I'M TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND PARTNER- WE IN ATTEMPT OUR LOCAL AIRPORTS TO WORK. WITH CALIFORNIA AND- TO INCREASE THOSE BURNT WINDOWS ONE OF THE LARGEST HURDLES WE STILL HAVE THOUGH. IS THE PRESCRIBED FIRE LIABILITY AND THAT'S ADDRESSED- BROUGHT UP IN THAT TASK FORCE REPORT. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PARTNER YANG- AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH BUT UNTIL WE SOLVE. THE LIABILITY CHALLENGE- THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE. A LARGE HURDLE TO PRESCRIBED FIRE BUT NOW WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF PROGRESS IN EDUCATING COMMUNITY. OUTREACH ADDRESSING PERMITTING HURDLES AND GETTING THE. WORK FORCE IN PLACE TO DO THE WORK. AND LAST POINT IN IS SOMEONE YOU RAISE THE MAKE NATIONAL PRESCRIBED TRAINING. WHERE REALLY. EXCITED THE- OF THAT COME TO CAL. AND WITH FIRE ON MAKING THE CASE WORKING DELEGATION AND FEDERAL AGENCIES- TO REALLY MAKE THAT INVESTMENT. GREAT AND THEN I JUST HAVE TO OTHER QUESTIONS AT ALL LINKED TOGETHER IN THE FIRST IS HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. ADDITIONAL DEDICATED FUEL CREWS DON'T END UP GETTING DIVERTED TO FIRE SUPPRESSION AND JUST SORT OF PULLED AWAY FROM. THE FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND ALSO WHETHER CAL FIRE HAS A PLAN TO ENCOURAGE RETENTION OF THE CRUISE THEMSELVES SO- A LITTLE BIT OF WORK FORCE QUESTION A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THE RESOURCES WERE SAYING WE NEED TO KEEP THEM. EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I WANT TO JUST CHECK IN AND SEE IF TO PORTER. IS STILL OUR PRESIDENT OF PS I WOULD YEAH HE'S GONNA SPEAKING JUST A MOMENT. I MEAN JUST ACKNOWLEDGE CHEAP THE WATER AND HIS TEAM. OKAY ARE YOU KNOW ABSOLUTE PARTNERS WITH OUR AGENCY AND EVERYONE ELSE AND ALL THINGS WILD- RESILIENCE- A LOT OF ATTENTION AND RIGHTLY SO IT'S PROVIDED TO. THEIR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO FIRES. BUT THEY REALLY BAD- THE EFFORT IN SO MANY RESPECTS BUILDING RESILIENCE. THIRTY PORTER- RESPONDING TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS QUESTIONS AROUND YOUR CRUISE AND HOW TO AVOID THEM GETTING SORT OF CANNIBALIZE. AND ALSO RETAIN. ABSOLUTELY- THANK YOU SO. AND THANK YOU. I REMEMBER. FOR THE QUESTION. TRUE LAST YEAR WAS A DIFFICULT YEAR AND THE STATISTICS WILL SHOW. THAT THE FUEL SCREWS SPOTFIRE- BECAUSE OF THE SEASON THAT WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT- WE ARE COMMITTED TO KEEPING THOSE CREWS WORKING ON FUELS PROJECTS- ALEX THEIR PRIMARY AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO- SO THAT IS A- COMMITMENT. FROM ME FOR FUEL SPRUCE- YOU- AND THE AND CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AS FAR AS RETENTION OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS YES WE'VE HAD SOME RETENTION ISSUES- IN THOSE POSITIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAINED TO A LEVEL OF. A FIREFIGHTER. AND THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR- TRANSFERRED INTO THAT TYPE OF THE JOB. SO THERE'S A TERM THAT'S BEEN. THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING. PART OF- WHAT YOU HEARD THE L. A. O. PER. RELATE TO. DEVELOPING CREWMEN- A CLASSIFICATION- BAD IS KEY IN ORDER TO STOP THAT CHURN AND GET GET POSITIONS SETTLED INTO JOBS THAT THEY'LL BE AND FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AT A MINIMUM OR MAYBE FOR A CAREER SO. THAT IS IMPORTANT- IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION I THINK THAT WAS ITEM OF THREE. AND THEN- CHIU JUST A TOUCH ON A QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED RELATED TO BURN PERMITS. I AM FIRST AND PRESCRIBED BURN PERMIT SPECIFICALLY- WE HAVE AUTOMATED OUR- BURN PERMIT PROGRAM STATEWIDE SO NOW FOR REGULAR BURN PERMITS THOSE ARE AUTOMATED AND THERE. IT'S A WEB BASED PROGRAM WE'RE IN THE WE'RE IN THE PILOT PHASE SO IT'S BEEN TESTED AND NOW IT'S GOING TO RULE OUT- THIS SPRING TO ALL OF THE STATE. THAT WILL INCLUDE- AS WE GET INTO MORE OF THE PRIVATE BURNING OR PRESCRIBED BURNS- THAT WILL BE. THE PLATFORM THAT'S USED THERE AS WELL. THANK YOU OVER MUCH. THANK YOU SOME MEMBER SMITH. THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM A COUPLE OF KIRK OF CLARIFICATION I'M NOT SURE WHO WOULD LIKE ANSWER BUT THE NUMBERS IS IT 40% FEDERAL LAND 37% PRIVATE LAND AND THEN 23% STATE OWNED PROPERTY I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THOSE NUMBERS THAT ARE ABOUT. NEAR 57% FEDERAL LANDS 40% PRIVATE LAND AND 3% STATE OWNED IN CALIFORNIA THE FOOD. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HAD THE RIGHT NUMBERS THERE. BECAUSE I ADDED THAT THEY'RE PERFECT THANK YOU AND THEN- A COUPLE OTHER CONCERNS THAT THE STEWARDSHIP. OF THE STATE OWNED LAND. IT WAS TWELVE MILLION APPROVED OF AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY THE BUDGET ONE POSITION. AND FOR THE MONEY BUT THE TO DATE THAT WOULD POSITION HAS NOT BEEN FILLED- AND OF WHAT IS A PROGRESS WITH THAT EFFORT. AND HOW WAS THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY APPROPRIATIONS SPENT IF THAT POSITION WASN'T FILLED. IN DIFFERENT PARTS ON THAT IF THEY'RE HERE. YOUR. HOW DID HER COMMENTS. IT PARSES ONLINE WEEK DIFFERENT OF THEM OKAY BUT IF THEY ARE NOT ONLINE I'M HAPPY TO TALK THROUGH WHAT ARE PROPOSAL WHAT OUR DELIVERABLES ARE WOULD BE PROPOSED AB FINDING FOR STATE OWNED LANDS IN THIS BUDGET THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GIVE YOU SOME TARGETS WELL IF IT IF IT WASN'T FIELD AND YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR IT AGAIN THIS YEAR AND IT WASN'T SPENT THAT'S WHAT THE CLARIFICATION I JUST WANTED PRETTY MUCH- WE CAN FOR. STATE TAX ON THAT BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THAT IT'S A NEW. INVESTMENT IT'S A IT'S A NEW PROPOSAL OF CREATING AN ACTUAL PROGRAM TO REALLY START DOING FIRE RESILIENT AND FUEL REDUCTION. ON STATE OWNED LANDS- MOST OF OUR STATE. PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN RUN OFF THE RECEIVING GRANT DOLLARS FROM- THE FROM OUR FOREST HEALTH ENTIRE CAPACITY PROGRAMS AND OTHERS. AND SO THIS CREATES TOUGH STUDY FUNDING STREAM FOR STATE PARKS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE. TO ACTUALLY START DOING YOUR PRODUCTION WORK ON A REGULAR BASIS AND TO REALLY START RAMPING UP- THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE STATE PARKS FROM ABOUT A THOUSAND ACRES HERE TREATED. TO TWENTY FIVE. THOUSAND ACRES YOU'RE TREATED ANSWERED. FROM ABOUT A THOUSAND ACRES YOU'RE TREATED TO- TO CLOSER TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES HERE TO READ IT. WOULD PRESERVE THE MIND IT MIGHT IT SAYS THE L. A. O.'S OFFICES CALLING FOR THIS A REJECTION OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM SO I. DON'T KNOW IF L. L. A- WOULD LIKE TO. COMMENT ON THAT- NOT.

SEVEN THANK YOU SURE BLOOM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS TAYLOR WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SENIOR ADVISOR FOR CLIMATE FINANCE- VERY HAPPY HAVE THE CHANCE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANNELS ONE PROGRAM. A SPECIFICALLY THE APPLICATION IN CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE AND I WILL BE BRIEF IN MY REVIEW HERE. BOB THE CALIFORNIA DO YOU YOU MAY RECALL FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET IS SOMETHING OF A NEW. APPROACH A NEW TOOL TO LIKE IN THE STATE'S APPROACH TO CLIMATE FINANCE AND- DANCING ARE THE ENERGY CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE AGENDA. IT IS REALLY IN THE MODEM DEVELOPMENT FINANCE- IN THE WAY THAT HAS DRIVEN ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD FOR A LONG TIME. UTILIZING A DEVELOPMENT BANK MINDSET TO SIT ALONGSIDE OUR GRANT PROGRAMS IN OUR REGULATIONS DEMOBILIZED PUBLIC MONEY BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PRIVATE MONEY ALONGSIDE. JERRY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGING LOCAL PROJECTS. LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE IS A TOOL FOR THIS TO LEVERAGE FROM PUBLIC MONEY TO THAT OF. THIS IS A MY- ROUGHLY. CHARACTERIZED AS GREEN BANKS THAT IS NOT A POOR ANYMORE TWELVE STAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT'S A BIT OF ACROSS THE GROUND WORLD THE MOBILE I COMMITTEE STRUCTURE. NOW BEING DISCUSSED THE FEDERAL AS A MAJOR TOOL. TWO REALLY DRIVE SIGNIFICANT ANDERSON IN CAPITAL FOR CLIMATE RESEARCHER GOALS IN MULTIPLE SECTORS. IT BEYOND THE MODEL HERE WOULD LEVERAGE THE SIGNIFICANT CAPACITIES OF THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK WHICH IS TWENTY FIVE PLUS YEARS OLD. HAS MOBILIZED MORE THAN FORTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS USING A RANGE OF. FAIRLY STANDARD PUBLIC BANKING TOOLS. BUT NOW WITH THE ADDITION OF AB SEVENTY EIGHT FROM LAST SESSION. CREATING A CATALYST FUND ENABLING YOU HAVING TO USE THOSE TOOLS AND THE HUMAN RESOURCES. TO DRIVE MONEY. AND PARTNER WITH PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION. REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THERE AND IS A SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE INTERESTS AND SUPPORTING STATE INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS FOR CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY. INCLUDING. THE SPACE APARTMENTS MART AT. WE'RE SORRY ROUGHLY THREE TO DOLLARS OR MO. OF PRIVATE FOR EVERY DOLLAR DEPLOYED. SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE'S OFFICIAL APPROACH TO OUR COMING CLEAN EERGY AGENDA- BUT IN A COMPARISON DOWNEY APPROACH THIS LAST YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL LAST YEAR OF A LARGE SCALE TOP DOWN CAPITAL ONE. WE'RE LOOKING SECTOR BY SECTOR AND NEAR TERM OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVE THAT HE SAID. IT IS LEVERAGED REVOLVING LOAN FUND PROGRAMS THAT DEPLOYS CAPITAL UNLOCKS MARKETS AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. IF THE MONEY BACK AND REINVEST IT. CAN BE A KEY NEW TOOL THAT WE CAN SCALE OVER TIME THIS IS RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S RECOMMENDATIONS OF. A PILOT APPROACH. FROM LAST YEAR'S OFFER. THE RECORDING SECTOR. WE ARE WE OF THE CASH NEED ACROSS THE RANGE OF CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURAL. INDUSTRIES GENERALLY. PARTICULARLY IN METHANE MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION OF ORGANIC WASTE AND LARGELY UP IN PARTICULAR IN THE FOOD PROCESSING SECTOR WORK WE'VE ALREADY HAD A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS WITH. PRIVATE FIRMS PRIVATE INVESTORS THAT WANT TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLEAN ENERGY UTILIZATION. AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IN THE FOOD PROCESSING SECTOR AND THIS IS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE NOW KNOW THAT. ADAM ROUGHLY 8% EMISSIONS THE AG SECTOR CONTRIBUTES MORE THAN IMPORTED POWER DOES AND IS COAST GUARD CLOSELY BEHIND IN STATE ELECTRICITY GENERATION SO THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT. SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES BUT IT IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL GREEN TRIBUTE HERE TO THE SENATE SOLUTIONS. BE AFFECTED THE PRODUCTION OF CLEAN RENEWABLE WELL A FIFTY EIGHT THE PRODUCTION OF EVENTS POPULOUS OF HYDROGEN DRIVING DOWN ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THROUGH ENERGY EFFICIENCY ALTERNATIVE OBSTACLES PRACTICES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OKAY- THE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT ARE BEING DEPLOYED. THEY ARE ON THE EDGE OF COMMERCIAL. ACCELERATION AND THIS AMOUNT OF PUBLIC CAPITAL CAN REALLY LEVERAGE. THE MAINSTREAM OF. ADOPTION SO WE ARE OFFERING THE THEY ARE REAL OPPORTUNITIES- AND IT'S A UNDER. UNDERGRAD ASPECT OF OUR CLIMBING COMMUNITY AGENDA AND ACCOUNTS FOR. I WAS FORCED TO MAKE US. CONTRIBUTION THE LAST THING I WANT POINT OUT THERE ARE ALSO. FROM THE L. A. R. ASSESSMENT OF THE HERE- THE KIND FONG WORKS CLOSE WITH. GO BUT ALSO WITH- JOHNSON PLANNING. AND ENTER GROWTH COUNCIL- AND WE ABOUT PROGRAM GREAT OF AB SEVENTY EIGHT TO ARTICULATE WHERE THE CAPITAL'S FUND IS LOOKING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS TO BE AMERICA THE FORWARD LOOKING YEAR. THIS CATEGORY WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT BOB REALLY BECAUSE IT WAS A LATE BREAKING OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD. BY OUR COLLEAGUES AT CDFA INTERESTED IN USING THE IRAQ AND OUR LOAN PROGRAM BROACHED TO REALLY DRIVE PROGRESS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF ANSWER. SO THIS I THINK IS INDICATIVE OF A KEY PARTNERSHIP AND HOW WE HOPE THIS PROGRAM GROWS OVER TIME. THE I THINK IN THE COMMENTS FUND AS A DEVELOPMENT FINANCE FUNCTION FOR THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS PRODUCT AND WITH PARTNERSHIPS AT THE AGENCY LEVEL SETTING POLICY SETTING REGULATION. WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEIR CONSTITUENCIES AND OBERNOLTE LIKE. THIS DEVELOPMENT FINANCE METHODOLOGY I THINK IS THE MODEL FOR DRIVING SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE CAPITAL LONG STOCK WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY A MODEST- PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION AGAIN TO THE PILOT AGAIN AT THE L. A. O. SUGGESTED WE START WITH SOME. OF THAT IN A IN A NUTSHELL IS THE APPROACH- FOR THE COMING CATALYSTS THAN PLANETS MURDER ACT AS PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET AND I WELCOME ANY ANY COMMENTS EITHER NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY. GIVEN YOUR TIGHT CALENDAR TODAY. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE- PRESENTATION. ARE THERE. ANY QUESTIONS. THINK OF A THIS. THANK YOU. THREE I HAVE A QUESTIONS THE K. AND TRADE EXPAND FOR- THE CURRENT TIME DOES NOT INCLUDE FUND FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM- DOES THE ADMINISTRATION INTEND THAT THE CLEAN FUEL REWARDS PROGRAM- ADMINISTERED BY THE UTILITIES WILL BECOME THE PRIMARY STATE REBATE PROGRAM. I THINK THAT MAYBE FOR THE NEXT ITEM YEAH ALL THE DOCUMENTS CAN BE FOR ITEM- SEVEN. THANKS HOLD ON TO THAT QUESTION. OKAY I HAVE IT. OKAY I'LL ALWAYS STAND FOR OUR GREAT THANK YOU- LEARN NOW WHY DON'T WE HEAR FROM THE L. A. L. FAVORING WITH THE BOARD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- OUR COMMENTS WERE REPRODUCED IN THE AGENDA SO I'M NOT GOING TO RUN THROUGH ALL OF THEM IN THE INTEREST. OF TIME I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE DID- AS MISTER ADLER NOTED- SUGGEST A PUBLIC PROGRAM IN OUR COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMIC CATALYST. FARM THE LAST YEAR. AND THIS OTHER INDEED TO BE CONSIDERED SUCH A PILOT PROJECT- WE ALSO NOTETHAT CURRENT LAW REQUIRES I THINK GENERALLY REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT THE CLIMATE CATALYST LOANS ITS PORTFOLIO- AND SHOULD YOU PROVIDE FUNDING FOR CLIMATE CATALYST WE RECOMMEND- INCREASING THE RE EXTENDING THE REPORTING PART SO MUCH REQUIRE I THINK TO ALSO REPORT A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT EACH PROJECT. SO THAT THE STATEMENT SAYS THE FINANCIAL RISKS ARE AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRIVATE CAPITAL IS PARTICIPATING IN FINANCING THESE PROJECTS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR COMMENTS ON THE AGENDA. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIRTY FIVE OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE AT NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL THIS IS A- INTERESTING PROPOSAL AS IT WAS LAST YEAR- THERE SO- I THINK WE UNDERSTAND IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT- I KNOW- OUR STAFF- AS CONTINUING QUESTIONS ABOUT- JUST HOW EFFECTIVE THE- THE- OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE AND THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO- TO DETERMINE GIVEN THAT IT'S A NEW PROGRAM AND- EXPERIMENT OF SORTS. BUT TO- WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT AND TO COME BACK TO IT TO- AND FUTURE HEARING.

AS YOU'VE HEARD THE LAST FEW HOURS TWENTY TWENTY WAS REALLY AN UNPRECEDENTED YEAR OF ACCELERATED CLIMATE IMPACTS IN EVERY CORNER OF OUR STATE FROM RECORD BREAKING HEAT TO HISTORIC DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. TO GATHER CALIFORNIA CALL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND ENFORCE OUR PROGRAMS AIMED AT PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND SURE TO FOCUS ON EQUITY IN ALL OF OUR WORK AND ADVANCED ARE VICIOUS CLIMATE GOALS AS SECRETARY BLUMENFELD JUST SHARED. GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS CONTINUED TO PRIORITIZE OURCLIMATE ACTION WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL A KEY PILLAR OF THE PROPOSED CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT BUDGET IS THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND EXPENDITURE PLAN I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE JDRF PROPOSAL TODAY. TO DATE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS GENERATED ALMOST THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN AUCTION PROCEEDS TO FIND CRITICAL CLIMB INVESTMENT PROGRAMS. INCLUDING AN OPTION THAT POSTED A PROJECTED OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PROCEEDS JUST LAST MONTH. THANKS TO YOUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS AND DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS ENVISIONED IN SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE IN AB FIFTEEN FIFTY. DIRECTING PROJECTS TOWARDS THESE COMMUNITIES IS A KEY OBJECTIVE OF THE FIVE. WE CONTINUE TO SET EXAMPLE FOR OTHER NATIONAL AND SUB NATIONAL CLIMATE PROGRAMS BY EMPHASIZING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND EQUITY AND PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. NOTABLY OF THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS ALREADY BEEN LEGISLATIVELY APPROPRIATED AND SPENT ABOUT 55% OF THOSE PROCEEDS HAVE DIRECTLY BENEFITED ARE DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. HERE TWENTY NINETEEN SO ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S PRIORITY POPULATIONS TO DATE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROVIDE PROPOSED EXPENDITURE PLAN INCLUDES ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING SEVERAL KEY EARLY ACTIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TO TWENTY ONE. FOR WE PRIORITIZED EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ADVANCE THE STATE PARTIES OUT OF NUMBER FOR ONE EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NUMBER TWO PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THREE DRIVING A GREEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EXPENDITURE PLAN ALSO ADVANCES THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT CLIMATE EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON THEIR MACHINE VEHICLES AND NATURAL BURKE AND LANCE. THE PLAN PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM CREATED THROUGH SB SIX SEVENTEEN IN WHICH DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHIANG FROM CARBON HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER. BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF F. B. TWO HUNDRED THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS FOR OUR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND ENSURE THAT THE ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT CURRENTLY LACK ACCESS. TO SAFE DRINKING WATER RECEIVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. TOGETHER THESE INVESTMENTS REFLECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIZING OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE PLAN ALSO PROPOSES SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS DEDICATED TO THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THE LARGEST SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE MAIN DRIVER OF HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION IN OUR STATE. THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THE TRANSPORTATION PACKAGE INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR EQUITY FOCUSED TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS WHICH TOGETHER FIND FOR EXAMPLE LOW INCOME CAR SHARING PROGRAMS VANPOOL IS FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND SCHOOL BUSES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS INCLUDING INCENTIVES FOR CLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD FREIGHT EQUIPMENT THE SO CALLED EIGHT STAR PROGRAM RUN OUT OF FUNDING IN JUST TWO WEEKS. AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HIGH DEMAND FOR THESE INCENTIVES ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION FOR THE FARMER PROGRAM WHICH FUNDS CLAMOR CLEANER AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES AND ENGINES. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHICH RECEIVES THE BULK OF FARMER FUNDING HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. IN PENDING APPLICATIONS. TURNING OVER OLDER AND HIGHER POLLUTING VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. AS MANY CALIFORNIANS CONTENT CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM POOR AIR QUALITY AND ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE BORNE THE CLERK BURDEN OF POLLUTION FOR TOO LONG. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FURTHER PROPOSES THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE LEGISLATURE IS ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS BEING DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE BUT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND TO CLEAN UP CONSTRUCTION AND AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT AND LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. TOGETHER WITH A CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED PROGRAMS WHICH ACCOUNT 465% OF GRF SPENDING AND INCLUDE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRANSIT PROJECTS AND TRANSIT ORIENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

AS ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED BY SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND DISCUSSED IN ITEM FIVE INCLUDED WITHIN THIS PLAN IS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION AND INVESTMENT STARTS SB NINE A ONE TO SUPPORT WILDFIRE RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY SECRETARY BLUMENFELD AND I ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LET ME LEAD OFF THEIR QUESTIONS- BY- ASKING BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY QUESTION THAT IS. POSED IN THE STAFF REPORT JOHN CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING AND NOT FUNDING. TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES URBAN GREENING LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION. CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM AND TO- WASTE DIVERSION AND RECYCLING. I KNOW IT'S A LOT. THERE IS THERE IS A LOT- CHAD THIS IS JARED AND LEARN CAN CHIME IN ON ON THE SPECIFICS- I GUESS. THE FRAMING THAT LARA AND- GAVE TO THE BUDGET- IT IS THE IS THE ONE I THINK INSTRUCTED HOW WE PRIORITIZED FUNDING- AND- IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE HEALTH AND THEN GREEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND AS- AS WE KNOW. EVEN WITH THE HELP THE AUCTION RETURNS FROM LAST WEEK ASSEMBLY ISN'T I'M NOT MONEY AND WITH SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE FUNDING GOING TO CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS- THERE'S LESS. DISCRETIONARY FUND AND GO AROUND AND SO ON ON ALL THESE PROGRAMS BUT I'M PICKING UP ON ON ONE OF THE LED QUESTIONS- A MINUTE AGO ABOUT CVR PETE FOR INSTANCE- THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WE'VE WATCHED I PROJECT LINE CAMPOLI WE CURRENTLY FOR INSTANCE HAVE FORTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN CV HAPPY- WAIT WAIT COMMITTED TO LOOKING AT THIS AS THE YEAR GOES ON- AND- IT SAYS. YOU KNOW THESE ARE VERY HARD TRADE OFFS CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND WE TOOK A LOT OF- DILIGENCE AND SCRUTINY LOOKING OUT WALK WHAT MADE THE MOST SENSE GIVEN THOSE THREE. CRITERIA IT SO I'M WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANY ONE OF THOSE AND MORE SPECIFIC DETAIL- BUT THE BIG THRUST WAS TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT WE WILL FUNDING THINGS THAT WE'RE TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE AND THE AGENDA THAT WOULDN'T BE FUNDED- OTHERWISE. AND THAT THOSE THREE GOALS. I DON'T KNOW LARGE WANTED TO ADD ANYTHING. ARE YOU COVERED IT SECRETARY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU- I. I THANK ALLAH- WITHHOLD ASKING MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO WEIGH IN ON ON THE- THESE PRIORITIES AND THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION SEPARATELY AND OFFLINE- MISERY THIS I KNOW YOU HAD QUESTIONS EARLIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO FOCUS MY QUESTIONS ON. OF THE LACK OF FUNDING- FOR C. V. R. P. AND URBAN GREENING- SO I HAD PREVIOUSLY ASKED THIS. OF ITO'S ART THE CURRENT PLAN DOESN'T INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM AND SO I WAS WONDERING IF THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS THAT THE CLEAN FUEL REWARDS PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY UTILITIES- WILL THIS BE THE PRIMARY STATE READ REBATE PROGRAM FOR NOW ON SINCE WE ARE NOT FUNDING C. V. R. P. I'M- SAID THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSAL- WE ARE CONTINUING TO FIND C. VIP THE VIP'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM FOR US WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TRANSPORTATION SIGNIFICAN TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS IN THIS PROJECT WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PRIORITIZE EQUITY BASED TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND REDUCING AIR POLLUTION FROM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I'M THE CITY OUR PROGRAMS THE UPKEEP PROGRAM- IS AN IMPORTANT HELLO- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL BASICALLY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS IT IT BASICALLY PROVIDES INCENTIVE FUNDING AT THE TIME OF SALE FULL ELECTRIC VEHICLE PURCHASES AS YOU MENTIONED- THAT THERE ARE THERE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT THAT THAT IS BEING FUNDED SO FESTIVAL WE HAVE A FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR. BALANCE IN THAT IN ADDITION THROUGH- THAT CLEAN FUELS PROGRAM WE HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT'S PAID FOR THROUGH- THAT PROGRAM AT THE TIME OF SALE LEASE SAYS THAT IS WE ALSO LOOKING AT- THE FEDERAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE TAX REBATE PROGRAM OF SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED- AND- THAT NEW ADMITTED MINISTRATION LOOK AT HOW THAT IS EXTENDED SO WE ARE A 100% THAT THOSE WITH YOU ON MAKING SURE ALL THAT. THE PACKAGES OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS IT MAKE IT EASIER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OF IT IS MADE EASIER PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT WE CONTINUE THE CDO PROGRAM C. V. I. P. PROGRAM WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN IT- WE IN THIS BUDGET JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR- FUNDING IS VERY TARGETED AT THE COMMUNITIES. THAT NEEDED THE FUNDING THE MOST. OKAY THANK YOU NOT I WITH YOU THAT WE BE FOR. ON LOW AND INCOME CAN. AND THAT THEIR SH BE. MORE PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW MORE FUNDING REBATE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THAT- I APPRECIATE THAT- THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR YOU- IN MY NEXT QUESTION WAS RELATED TO THE URBAN GREENING PROGRAM WHICH IS ALSO NOT INCLUDED- IN THIS BUDGET OF YOU KNOW I THINK. THE URBAN GREEN PROGRAM IT WAS A PRIORITY FOR ME AND IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO REDUCE HEAT. AND MITIGATE URBAN HEAT ISLANDS OF YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WAS THE HOTTEST ON RECORD ESPECIALLY IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH IS THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT. OF THERE'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW I THINK BY NOT INCLUDING URBAN GREENING WERE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THE DANGER OF HEAT- THAT HE HAS ON RESIDENTS IN OUR STATE. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHERE LIVE THAT LIVE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY MAY NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONING AT HOME AND I THINK. SO I JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS ON WHY THIS IS AN INCLUDED THIS YEAR ESPECIALLY AFTER THE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS THAT WE HAD LAST SUMMER. I'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'M AYE DATS AYE LIZZY OLD TO REJECT FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAYBE WEIGH IN ON THIS ONE. CERTAINLY THANK YOU SECRETARY WITH TH- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE BEEN. PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS ON AVAILABILITY I HAVE YOUR ACTION. SEATS HOWEVER EACH YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD REEVALUATE THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. ATHLETE BILLS SEEK ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION ON AUCTION PROCEEDS. OKAY LOOK AT WHAT I DO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO RE CONSIDER THIS YOU KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF ADVOCATES- THAT ARE YOU KNOW CONTACTING US ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF- INCLUDING THE URBAN GREEN PROGRAM AND CONTINUING TO FUND IT- AND YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- THAT MY COMMENTS ARE HEARD AND THAT KNOWING THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY THANK YOU IT'S A SUPER BIG PRIORITY TO ME AND WHEN I GO I WAS JUST INTRANSITIVE ON FRIDAY AND HAD THE SAME THING- SEVENTY ISSUES ARE I KIND OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT ISSUE THAT DOESN'T GET THE ATTENTION THAT WHILE CLOSE ALL SEA LEVEL RISE- BUT- HE ISSUES- I HUGE AND- HAVE BEEN CANOPY CAN REALLY BRING DOWN- THAT TEMPERATURE SIGNIFICANTLY SO. I WOULD LOVE TO- WHAT WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN GET FUNDING G. CARE ACT OTHERWISE TO MAKE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN IS DEFINITELY NOT FALLING ON DEAF EARS AND IT'S A BIG EQUITY CAN STAND UP FOR US. YEAH I AGREE IT DOESN'T GET ENOUGH ATTENTION COMPARED TO THE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU THAT YOU RAISED IN YOU KNOW I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE- FOR PRE THESE PROGRAMS YOU KNOW OF THERE ARE MORE HEAT DEATHS IN OUR STATE THEN ON COMPARED TO OTHER AREAS OR TO OTHER- REASONS FOR DEATHS AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- ONLY BECAUSE IT'S AFFECTING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT WE DON'T PUT IT ASIDE AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT LIKE YOU SAID IT IS AN EQUITY ISSUE- AND- IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF MY PRIORITIES. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THANK YOU MR SECRETARY IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THANKS FOR BEING HERE SO I'M- VERY EXCITED- I WAS VERY EXCITED TO HEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ABOUT- EV'S AND REALLY EXCITED TO- WORKING ON. MAKING THAT A REALITY HOWEVER EV'S ARE ONLY PART OF THE EQUATION I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT WE STILL HAVE TO FOCUS ON REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. BECAUSE OF COURSE CARS HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF IMPACT ON LAND USE ON HEAT ISLAND EFFECT ON THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT WE USE FOR PARKING AND CONGESTION IN OUR URBAN AREAS ON TRACK ON SAFETY ON ON SO MANY THINGS ON POLLUTION DIRECTLY OTHER FORMS OF POLLUTION THAT ARE EMISSIONS RELATED. SO WHAT THE L. A. O.'S CLAIMED IN THE PAST THAT THERE'S ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS IN CAP AND TRADE SPENDING THAT THAT'S THERE TO SUPPORT SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE- SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES STRATEGY PROGRAM. HOWEVER WE'RE STILL GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WITH EVEN MORE. MILES BEING TRAVELED WITH. LESS AND LESS YOU KNOW YOU DID NOT IS NOT FOCUSED STILL ON TRANSIT ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION CERTAINLY LAND USE. TO MAKE ALL THAT POSSIBLE. ISN'T ALWAYS DONE WITH AN EYE TOWARDS REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE A CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO WE CAN NEVER RECONSIDER. ANY OF THOSE STRATEGIES SO YOUR ANY THOUGHT GIVEN. AS TO HOW TO MAKE BETTER INVESTMENTS THREE THREE SEVENTY FIVE. TO REALLY. FOSTER BETTER LAND USE- SO THAT WE CAN MAKE TRANSIT MORE FEASIBLE AND SO THAT WE- CAN HELP PEOPLE REDUCE THEIR OWN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED I KNOW THAT'S A BIG QUESTION BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU'RE- GIVING ANY THOUGHT TO THAT IS WERE. YOU KNOW CONTINUING TO APPROPRIATE MONEY UNDER THREE SEVENTY FIVE. YEAH IT'S A HUGE IN REALLY IMPORTANT POINT- AND SADLY ONE THAT WE THINK ABOUT HOW. I'M IN EVERY CONTEXT- AS IF YOU'VE BEEN A LEADER IN CHAMPION N EVERYTHING FROM. PORTABILITY OF HOUSING BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE TO. EVEN DURING CALVET MANY ESSENTIAL WELCOME TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES TO THAT JOB BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND THE STATE. I'M ALSO T. APPLYING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND THOSE OPTIONS AND HOW THEY RECOVER OUT OF THE PANDEMIC OR LAKE TO. HOW WE THINK ABOUT I'M- MOVING AROUND THE STATE AND DOING IT LASTS AND SHORTENING THOSE DISTANCES YOUR 100% RIGHT WEEK WE CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE IS A REALLY APPRECIATE THAT POINT. THANKS A WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON THAT THIS YEAR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU ON TRYING TO FIND SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS BUT I GUESS MY POINT IN TERMS OF BUDGET IS THAT I DO THINK WE NEED TO RE EVALUATE SOME OF THE SPENDING AND MAKE SURE THAT WE FOCUS SAID- BETTER ON ON. PROJECTS THAT TRULY REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THANKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DID I CALL ALEJO. SORRY ABOUT THAT OF HERE FROM LA OF. HOME GOOD MORNING AGAIN ARE EXCUSE ME GOOD AFTERNOON- KNOWLEDGE EITHER IN PROGRESS NO PROBLEM ROSS BROWN AT THE L. A. AGAIN- I'M GONNA IN THE INTEREST OF TIME KEEP MY COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM VERY BRIEF IN JUST A FEW MAIN POINTS ARE COMMENTS ON THE OVERALL PACKAGE ONE JUST RELATED TO WHICH PROGRAMS TO FUND I WON'T REPEAT AND A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE. YOUR YEARS ABOUT. ISSUES TO CONSIDER- WHEN OF THE TERM THE PRIORITIES BUT ULTIMATELY HAVE A LOT OF THESE DECISIONS DO DEPEND ON LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. ARE DEPENDING ON HOW IT PRIORITIZES GREENHOUSE GASES LOCAL AIR QUALITY WILDFIRE SAFETY SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FOR EXAMPLE AND SO- JUST IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS PACKAGE REFLECTS THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ARGUE CANNON SHOULD. ADOPT A PACKAGE THAT REFLECTS THE PRIORITIES. I'M NOT FOCUSED MY OTHER COMMENTS REALLY MORE ON THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE PACKAGE INCLUDING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE FUNDING. SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE OVERALL REVENUE AND SPENDING AMOUNTS IN THE PACKAGE- WE DO THINK THE BETTER- GOVERNOR'S REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE. BUT AS YOU KNOW THIS IS A VOLATILE REVENUE SOURCE AND IT'S SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTY- THE CHAIR MENTIONED THAT THE FEBRUARY AUCTION RESULTS DO SHOW THAT REVENUES. ARE TRACKING SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT THE OF THE BUDGET ASSUMES BUT WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION- AFTER THE MAY AUCTION RESULTS ARE RELEASED AS WELL. ONE IMPORTANT THING WE DO WANT TO NOTICE THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD LEAVES ARE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- AND AS SORT OF A RESERVE IN THE FUND AFTER BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR. WE DO THINK THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT IT'S ABOUT 5% OF ANNUAL REVENUE. IS RELATIVELY SMALL GIVEN- THE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY AND SO WE THINK THAT OVER THE LONG TERM- THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR PROMOTING. LONG TERM FUND SOLVENCY AND FUNDING PREDICTABILITY- ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE TO- CONSIDER JUST A LARGER RESERVE- AND THERE'S NO REAL MAGIC NUMBER AND KIND OF WHAT THEY ARE THE BEST KIND OF SIZE OF A- RESERVE WOULD BE. BUT WE DO THINK A GOOD STARTING POINT TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU KNOW ROUGHLY 10% OR OR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OUR SERVERS DIRECTOR TO MAINTAIN THAT SOLVENCY AND PREDICTABILITY. THE FINAL POINT IS- EARLY ACTION- THERE IS A SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AS PART OF EARLY ACTION. MY COLLEAGUES- MISTER BROWN MENTIONED KIND OF OUR OFFICES. OVERALL THOUGHTS ON THIS WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRONG. FOR EARLY I WOULD GET THE WHILE. PIECE THAT'S BEEN A ONE ONE. P. SORT OF- THAT. BUT A LOT OF THE OTHER AT. ARE ARE. SPENDING PROPOSALS PART PACKAGE DO NOT MESS. AND SO WE THINK. OF THE LEGISLATURE SPOKEN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ACTION FUNDING AND JUST FOCUS. ON A WILDFIRE FOR A IS ONE OF. YOU KNOW THERE ARE IF THERE ARE SOME HIGH. PROGRAMS THE WHAT IS THE DOES ONE TO ALLOCATE MONEY IF YOU- A FEW MONTHS EARLIER- THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY IS ESSENTIALLY IN THE BANK WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WAS COLLECTED SO FAR. AND THEY START POPULATION SO FAR THAT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND MONEY AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND SO I THINK IT KIND OF CONSIDERED YOU KNOW- USING THAT AMOUNT- WHICH WOULD BE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ENOUGH IT DOES. HAVE SOME HIGH PRIORITY ON A SPENDING THAT WOULD LIKE TO ALLOCATE A FEW MONTHS EARLIER SO I'LL IN MY COMMENTS THEIR ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI GUYS THANK YOU IN A- TO THE SECRETARY'S COMMENTS ON C. EUROPEAN RESPONSE IN RESPONSE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVISED AS QUESTION.
