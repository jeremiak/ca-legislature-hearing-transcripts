LEGISLATURE HAS USED ON MULTIPLE

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.897
OCCASIONS THE X. BY -- TO SPEED

WILL FOCUS ON TESTIMONY THERE.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.050
WE ARE ALL AWARE THE CALIFORNIA

ACCORDING APARTMENT HOUSING.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.888
AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WE

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.156
HAVE AN ANNUAL PRODUCTION

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.058
SHORTFALL OF NEARLY A HUNDRED

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.793
THOUSAND HOMES MEDIUM HOME

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.528
PRICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA NOW.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.663
HAVE DOUBLE THAT OF THE AVERAGE

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.665
PRICE IS -- ACROSS AMERICA WERE

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.434
WERE RIGHT AT SIX HUNDRED

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.702

THIRD LOWEST HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:24.344
IN BROWN.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.079
THE COUNTRY COMPOUNDING THIS

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.580
PROBLEM IS THE SEQUEL PROCESS

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.915
WHICH HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.250
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AS A

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.652
ROADBLOCK -- TO DEVELOPMENT --

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.953
WE CAN ALL AGREE I BELIEVE THE

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.255
IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.489
ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS THE INTENT

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.591
OF SEQUEL -- BUT TOO OFTEN IT'S

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.893
SIMPLY USE TO DELAYED

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.361
DEVELOPMENT ALL TOGETHER WHICH

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.629
IS WHY THE LAW.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.964
AND PROCESS NEED SIGNIFICANT

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.966
REFORMS -- THE LEGISLATION

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.836
REFORM SEEMS TO BE OUT OF REACH

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.905
THE LEGISLATURE HAS REPEATEDLY

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.540
SPED UP THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.308
FOR HIGH PROFILE PROJECTS LIKE

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.677
SPORTING ARENAS WHICH I HAVE

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.512
SUPPORTED HOWEVER WE CAN TAKE

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.015
THAT ACTION WHY NOT DO SO FOR

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.384
MUCH NEEDED RESIDENTIAL UNITS

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.219
THEY GET TIED DOWN AND LIKELY --

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.654
EXPENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.322
OUR LAWSUITS IT'S CLEARLY A BI

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.692
PARTISAN POSITION AND SO WHAT SP

STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH IN

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:23.236
WHICH HE SAID IN RECENT YEARS --

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:24.270
BASICALLY SAYS WE NEED TO SPEED

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.738
UP THE SEQUEL PROCESS FOR

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:27.407
PROFESSIONAL SPORTING IT'S TIME

HOUSING AND AND I JUST WANT TO

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.946
ADD ON THAT TOO IN OUR YOUNGER

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:36.683
GENERATION ONE OF THE HIGHEST --

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.384
DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE LEAVING

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:39.719
OUR STATE ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:40.853
YOUNG PROFESSIONALS BETWEEN THE

AGES OF TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.325
NINE AND ONE REASON IS -- F.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.092
HOUSING VERY EXPENSIVE

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.362
CALIFORNIA SO ANYWAY -- THREE

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.896
EIGHTY FOUR IS A STRAIGHT

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:51.931
FORWARD STEP -- WE CAN TAKE TO

ADDRESS CALIFORNIA HOUSING

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.235
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND IT WILL

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.870
INSURE EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE

IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE D. AS

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.387
CASSIE GILSON REPRESENTING THE

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:18.891
CALIFORNIA -- BUILDING INDUSTRY.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.195
HEY KATHY HI.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:22.795
GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.130

APOLOGIZE FOR THE FLY IN A LOT

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.400
OF COMMITTEES THIS MORNING.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.769
I AM.

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.037
THE AUTHOR IS BRINGING FORWARD

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:31.904
AN ISSUE.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.806
THAT WE TALK ABOUT INFORMALLY

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.375
ALL THE TIME WHICH IS.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.510
YOU KNOW WE SEE A SERIES OF I'VE

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:38.111
NEVER HEARD OF THEM A STADIUM

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:39.445
BILLS.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:40.079
THEY SOMETIMES APPLIED TO OTHER

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.080
THINGS.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.482
WE ARE WE DO.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.784
LITIGATION SEEK WITH

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:45.685
STREAMLINING.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:46.619
THE QUESTION IS A FOUR WHEEL

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:49.055
BEFORE PREPARED TO ADMIT THAT.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.924
DOES MAKE A PROJECTS NEED SOME

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:53.226
STREAMLINING IN THEIR SICKLE

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.428
REVIEW -- WHEN WE HAD A HOUSING

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.497
CRISIS OF THE MAGNITUDE THAT I

00:04:57.563 --> 00:05:00.133
THINK THAT ANALYSIS LAYS OUT

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:00.933
WELL?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.136
WHY WOULDN'T WE CONSIDER DOING

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:04.937
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT -- FOR

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:09.108
HOUSING -- THE A COMMENT ON A

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.476
COUPLE OF ISSUES IN IN THE

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:12.945
ANALYSIS THE FIRST IS I THINK WE

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.714
OFTEN FRAMED THIS DEBATE -- IN A

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.349
MANNER THAT'S TOO HYPERBOLIC

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.818
IT'S C. QUICK IS THE CAUSE OF

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.553
THE HOUSING CRISIS OR SEEK WHAT

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.121
IS NOT A CAUSE OF THE HOUSING

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:24.123
CRISIS AND THE ANSWER IS IT'S

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.824
NOT A BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:25.591
CRISIS.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.960
IT IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR --

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:29.462
AND THOSE OF YOU THAT COME FROM

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.597
LOCAL GOVERNMENT KNOW THAT WHEN

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.133
YOU SAT ON WHEN YOU SAT ON CITY

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.268
COUNCILS AND BOARDS OF

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:36.803
SUPERVISORS AND YOU SEE THE

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.604
NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN THE NUMBER

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.205
OF HOUSING PROJECTS THAT COME

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:42.975
BEFORE YOU -- IN SEQUELLITIGATION -- YOU KNOW WE ALSO

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.510
CAN PLAY I HAVE A STUDY THAT

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:45.812
SAYS ACTS AND I HAVE A STUDY

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.180
THAT SAYS WHY AND THAT'S

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.948
PROBABLY NOT SO FRUITFUL FOR

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.216
DISCUSSION.

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.751
I'M THE THING THAT I IN THE

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:52.919
ANALYSIS PARTICULARLY THAT I

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:55.288
WANTED TO COMMENT ON WAS.

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:56.489
THIS IDEA THAT WE'VE DONE A

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.523
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SEQUEL

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.991
STREAMLINING N THE BUILDING AND

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:02.195
WHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH -- SEQUEL

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.731
ACTUALLY BEFORE WE DID THE WHOLE

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.966
HOST OF ADDITIONAL -- EXEMPTIONS

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.634
AND STREAMLINING CAME WITHOUT

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:09.535
SOME VERY THOUGHTFUL

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.570
STREAMLINING WHEN IT WAS FIRST

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:14.607
ENACTED AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT --

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:16.275
CREATIVE ATTORNEYS HAVE FOUND

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:17.744
WAYS AROUND IT I I SORT OF

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.112
ANALOGIZE IT TO THE TAX CODE IS

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:20.213
THAT PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST TO PUT

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.681
IT TOGETHER AND THEN PEOPLE ARE

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:22.281
CREATIVE AND THEN WE HAVE TO

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:23.049
KEEP.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.051
SORT OF COMING BACK AND

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:26.619
LEGISLATING AROUND LOOPHOLES AND

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.187
I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT --

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:29.122
THE MITIGATED NEGATIVE

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.690
DECORATION DECLARATION WHICH IS

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:33.326
PROBABLY THAT SORT OF PARAMOUNT

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:34.660
SEAQUEST REMINDING ISSUE.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.062
IS A TERRIFIC IDEA BECAUSE IT

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.363
RECOGNIZES THAT.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.397
IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT IF YOU'RE

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:39.999
DOING AN INFILL HOUSING IF

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:40.800
YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN INFILL

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.034
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR YOU'RE

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.903
LOOKING AT YOU KNOW A LARGE

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.404
INDUSTRIAL REFINERY OR OTHER

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:46.806
PROJECT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.307
REVIEW OUGHT TO REFLECT.

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.642
THE MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE IN

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:51.110
THOSE PROJECTS AND THE PROBLEM

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:52.512
IS THAT FOR MANY HOUSING

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:53.379
PROJECTS.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.348
WHO MIGHT WANT TO GO FORWARD

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:56.716
WITH A MEDICATED NEGATIVE

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:58.017
DECLARATION THERE?

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.118
IN A SITE THAT'S KNOWN FOR

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.287
HOUSING MORE CONTEMPLATED IN A

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.421
PLAN.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.123
IF THERE IS LOCAL CONTROVERSY

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.758
AROUND THE PROJECT SOMETIMES THE

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:06.993
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WON'T EVEN LET

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.028
YOU PROCEED WITH YOUR MEDICATED

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.329
NEGATIVE DECLARATION AND THEY

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.064
WILL SAY TO YOU DIRECTLY.

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.132
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.134
APPROPRIATE -- ANALYTICAL TOOL

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:16.836
WITHIN SEA QUEST BUT GIVEN THE

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:17.937
CONTROVERSY WE KNOW THERE'S

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:19.772
GONNA BE LITIGATION SO YOU MIGHT

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.374
AS WELL DO AN E. I. R. FROM THE

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.642
BEGINNING.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.111
AND SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.480
IN FOR THE OTHER -- STREAMLINING --

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.015
THAT'S NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS I

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.450
COULD SHARE SIMILAR STORIES --

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:32.685
AND THEN I THINK THE FINAL THING

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:33.953
I'LL SAY IS THAT.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.421
THE REASON.

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.623
THAT -- THE APPROACHING THIS

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.892
BILL FRANKLY WAS DEVELOPED FOR

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.260
THE KINGS ARE WE KNOW WHERE WE

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.529
WE ARE FORESEEN IS BECAUSE I

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:44.664
THINK FOLKS RECOGNIZE THAT THE

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.568
GOAL IS NOT -- TO GET OUT OF

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:49.936
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.137
AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.972
APPROACH THAT LOWERS ANY

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.141
ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS LOWERS

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:57.376
AND NAME -- MITIGATION

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:58.411
REQUIREMENTS OR IN ANY WAY

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:00.546
CONSTRAINS -- THE PUBLIC

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:02.181
ENGAGEMENT WHICH IS SUCH AN

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:03.983
IMPORTANT PART OF SEEK WHAT YOU

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.618
DO YOU PREPARE YOUR DOCUMENT YOU

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.553
HAVE A PUBLIC MEETINGS ABOUT IT

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.055
GOES BEFORE THE COUNCIL AND WHAT

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:11.290
THIS REALLY FOCUSES ON IS SEQUEL

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:12.792
LITIGATION ABUSE.

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:15.261
TRYING TO MAKE THAT PROCESS GO

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.029
FASTER AND MAKE CLEAR AND I

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.898
THINK THAT THIS IS ESPECIALLY

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.533
COMPELLING IN A HOUSE IN CONTEXT.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.968
BUT IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:23.803
GOVERNMENT THAT HAS SAID YES WE

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.338
WANT THIS HOUSING PROJECT AND WE

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:29.942
WANT THIS HOUSING PROJECT IN

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.143
THIS SITE.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:31.744
IF PEOPLE RAISE ISSUES THAT

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:32.311
ABOUT IT IN LITIGATION IT'S

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.312
APPROPRIATE THAT IF THE COURT

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:34.814
FINDS THAT.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.148
ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.516
MITIGATION IS NECESSARY THAT THE

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:39.151
PROJECT SHOULD HAVE TO DO IT BUT

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.520
THERE IS NO REASON.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.389
TO HOLD UP THE ENTIRE PROJECT

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.891
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS AND SOME WILL

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:45.758
SAY WELL IF YOU START THE

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:47.126
PROJECT AND YOU MIGHT DO DAMAGE

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.628
IN THE MEANTIME WHAT THE BILL IS

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.897
CRAFTED IN SUCH A WAY TO ENSURE.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:54.367
THAT -- IF THERE IS -- YOU KNOW

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.135
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS IF THERE

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.803
ARE ISSUES RELATED TO SACRED

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.338
SITES THAT FRANKLY CAN'T GET

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.940
UNDONE THOSE ARE THINGS FOR

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:01.874
WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.476
APPROPRIATE SO.

WITH THE COURT'S FUNDAMENTAL

ULTRA CALENDAR PREFERENCE HAS

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.026
THE PRACTICAL EFFECT.

THE COURT'S DOCKET TO THE BACK

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:30.930
OF THE LINE.

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.065
EVEN CASES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:35.334
HAS ALREADY PRIORITIZE JUST FOR

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.103
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.704
THE HOMEOWNER IF AN ACTION WAS

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.072
BROUGHT INTO THE HOME OWNER BILL

HOUSING OBVIOUSLY THIS

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:44.677
LEGISLATURE PASSED A VERY BROAD

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:46.145
PACKAGE COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE TO

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:47.680
TRY TO PROTECT PEOPLE.

FROM THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS IN

OR THE MUD SLIDES IN SANTA

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.230
BARBARA THOSE CASES MOVED TO THE

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:05.731
BACK OF THE LINE.

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.167

DISABILITIES.

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:15.408
IN FACT THERE WAS A RECENT

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:16.675
ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES WHERE

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:20.846
THIS US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:21.881
FOUND ONGOING DISCRIMINATION

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.849
AGAINST A AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.251
PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES SO THAT

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.119
LITIGATION WOULD MOVE TO THE

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.421
BACK OF THE LINE.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:29.555
JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES AND

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.223
NON HOUSING RELATED AREAS WOULD

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.292
ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED FOR

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.326
EXAMPLE.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:35.795
A PERSONAL INJURY ACTION

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.605
THE I COULD GIVE MANY MANY

00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:48.140
EXAMPLES THESE AND OTHER

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.142
IMPORTANT CASES ON THE COURT'S

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.710
DOCKET THIS WILL ALL TAKE LONGER

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:53.012
TO DECIDE WITH THIS SUPER

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:55.948
XCELERATED CALENDAR PREFERENCE.

00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:56.982
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.851
THESE -- THIS XCELERATED COUNT

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:00.219
CALENDAR PREFERENCE OF SECRET

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.555
CUSE OF ACTION WILL NOT PROVIDE.

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.156
THE SECURITY THAT THE PROPONENTS

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.558
ARE SEEKING.

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:06.659
THE JUSTIFICATION THAT WE'VE

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.461
ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THE TWO

00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:09.261
HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY TIMELINE IS

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:11.263
THE CERTAINTY THAT SUPPOSEDLY

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.164
WOULD COME.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.766
WITH THE LITIGATION BEING

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.701
COMPLETELY WRAPPED UP.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.870
IN A IN THIS RELATIVELY SHORT

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:18.871
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:21.040
BUT OUR EXPERIENCE IN ACTUAL A.

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:22.241
B. NINE HUNDRED STREAMLINING

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:24.577
CASES IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:25.611
THEIR LITIGATION AGAINST THE

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:26.912
WARRIORS ARENA.

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:29.181
AND THE LITIGATION AGAINST THE

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:29.682
EIGHTY ONE FIFTY SUNSET

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:31.317
BOULEVARD PROJECT BOTH HAD

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:32.985
MULTIPLE LAWSUITS MULTIPLE

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:34.620
CAUSES OF ACTION WHERE THE

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.222
SEQUEL PORTION.

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.923
WAS ON THE SUPER ACCELERATED

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.059
TIMELINE BUT THE REGULAR -- NON

SEQUEL PORTIONS OF THE

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.695

USUAL CIVIL PROCEDURE TIME LINES

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.732
NOT PROVIDING THE CERTAINTY THAT.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.934
IS SUPPOSEDLY THE CORNERSTONE

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.069
FOR THIS APPROACH.

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:51.504
THE COUNCIL ALSO IS STRONGLY

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:47.399
THESE AUTHORS OF WORK VERY HARD

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:49.434

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:51.103
INSURE THAT HE COULD DOES THE

00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:52.604
JOB THAT WAS INTENDED TO DO WHEN

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.673
IT WAS PUT INTO PLACE MANY YEARS

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.307
AGO.

THOSE COMMENTS -- THERE HAS BEEN --

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:02.214
PROPOSALS TO CREATE SPECIALITY

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.717
SECRET -- THAT SENATOR CORBETT

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:07.152
AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICKINSON.

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.754
TRIED IN AROUND TWENTY TWELVE OR

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.055
SO WE DID OPPOSE THIS WE HAVE A

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:11.189
LONG HISTORY OF OPPOSING

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:12.424
SPECIALLY COURT LEGISLATION

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:13.892
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EFFICIENT

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.427
WAY OF ADMINISTERING.

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:17.095
OUR COURTS THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:19.297
SEQUEL CASES -- YOU KNOW WE

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:20.832
DON'T CONTROL WHAT CASES GET

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.434
FILED IN WHICH COURTS AND HOW

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:29.141
OFTEN -- ARE.

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:29.941
OUR COURTS ARE NOT TELLING US

00:23:30.008 --> 00:23:30.575
THEY NEED MORE SICK BUT JUDGES

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:31.209
ARE SPECIALTY COURTS TO HANDLE

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:31.743
THE CASES.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.677
THE BIGGEST AREA OF DELAY IN

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.179
SEQUEL ACCORDING TO MY EXPERTS

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.113
IS FIGHTS OVER THE

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.414
ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD AND THERE

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:37.649
ARE SOME IDEAS THAT WE HAVE THAT

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:39.084
WE'VE OFFERED TO TO MEMBERS OF

00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:40.385
THE LEGISLATURE TO STREAMLINE

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:42.888
THAT PROCESS -- BUT THINK

00:23:42.954 --> 00:23:44.389
RECORDS ARE SPECIALLY COURTS ARE

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:45.824
SPECIAL FUNDING FOR SICK WITH

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.926
JUDGES IS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:49.795
WE THINK IS THE BEST WAY OF

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:50.395
PROCEEDING IN HANDLING THESE

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:53.098
ISSUES.

00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:54.966
THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE.

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:58.270

COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:01.206
DISCUSSION THAT HAS -- THAT

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:04.976
WE'VE SEEN SO FAR -- THERE'S NO

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:07.412
QUESTION THAT -- THE SPORTS

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.147
STADIA THAT HAVE [inaudible]

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:10.081
GOTTEN.

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:14.286
EXPEDITED REVIEW -- DID RECEIVE

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:15.854
EXPERT REVIEW BUT I I GUESS THE

00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:17.322
THE THE THING IS THAT IN ALL

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:19.257
THOSE CASES INCLUDING THE NINE

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:21.259
HUNDRED CASES -- THERE ARE THERE

00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:22.694
ARE THERE WERE TERMS THAT WERE

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:24.129
INCLUDED THAT MADE THE PROJECTS

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.831
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUPERIOR THE

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:27.332
IDEA BEING THAT IF WE'RE GOING --

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:29.134
TO GRANT LENIENCY UNDER THE

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:30.735
CALIFORNIA FROM A QUALITY ACT.

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.070

NEXT LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:35.407
QUALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:37.676
PROJECT AND I WILL SAY THAT'S AT

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:38.510
LEAST.

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:40.245
ARE A LARGE PART OF THE SPIRIT

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.981

REFORM BUT NONE OF THEM'S WORK

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:10.155
AT SECOND WHILE THE REASON I

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:11.389
DIDN'T TAKE THE MEASUREMENTS AS

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:13.158
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THESE

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.592
BILLS THAT COME FORWARD ARE VERY

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:17.462

AMENDMENTS OF WATERS IT DOWN AND

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:21.366
THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN THAT'S WHY

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:22.734
WERE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:23.735
HOUSING UNITS SHORT.

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:24.903
AGAIN ONE OF THE LARGEST

00:28:24.969 --> 00:28:26.171
DEMOGRAPHIC SLEEVE IN OUR STATE

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:27.172
ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED YOUNG

00:28:27.238 --> 00:28:28.540
PROFESSIONALS THEY CAN'T AFFORD

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:29.641
TO BUY HOMES HERE.

00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:31.076
IN WAS INTERESTING SOME OF WHAT

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:33.678
THE OPPOSITION SAID -- I I LOVE

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:35.613
IT HERE IT IS THE GENTLEMAN

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.682
RIGHT HERE SAID IT IT'S BAD FOR

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:38.616
THE COURTS.

00:28:38.683 --> 00:28:41.219
WE'LL SEE I'M GOT ELECTED TO

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:42.654
REPRESENT MY CONSTITUENTS SO I

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.888
GIVE MORE PRIORITY TO THE

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.590
CITIZENS OF OUR STATE FIRST TIME

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:46.391
HOME BUYERS.

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:48.126
PEOPLE NEED HOUSING MORE THAN I

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:50.995
AM -- THE COURT SYSTEM OR THE

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:54.265
BUREAUCRACY AND AND AND ANOTHER

00:28:54.332 --> 00:28:55.633
COMMENT WAS MADE THAT THAT

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.734
SOMEHOW I THINK THIS BILL

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:59.704
PREFERS -- DEVELOPERS YOU KNOW

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:02.073
OVER YOU KNOW SICK WHAT.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.775
THAT THAT'S NOT ACCURATE EITHER

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:06.077
I PREFER OUR CITIZENS TO GET IN

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:07.545
HOMES BECAUSE AS OUR GOVERNOR

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:09.647
SAYS IS THAT -- C. A. R. SALES

00:29:09.714 --> 00:29:11.382
OF THE BILLING INDUSTRY SAYS WE

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:12.383
DO HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.552
WRITING -- SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:16.221
FOR YOUR MEDIUM -- PRICE HOME IN

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:18.089
CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN IT'S NOT

00:29:18.156 --> 00:29:19.457
THAT I PREFER DEVELOPERS I

00:29:19.524 --> 00:29:21.025
PREFER OUR CITIZENS TO BE ABLE

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:22.327
TO GET IN HOMES I WANT TO KEEP

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:23.895
THEM HERE KEEP THEM PRODUCTIVE.

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:25.130
AND I THINK HOME OWNERSHIP IS A

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:26.631
DREAM FOR PEOPLE AND THEN

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:27.765
ANOTHER THING WHICH I THOUGHT

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.634
WAS WAS IN SOME WAYS YOU SHOW

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:30.034
HOW.

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:32.604
SOME PEOPLE GET -- MIRED DOWN IN

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.573
THE BUREAUCRACY IS -- THAT ONE

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.941
OF THE GERMS BEGIN APPEAR TALKED

00:29:37.008 --> 00:29:38.643
ABOUT THIS HE MENTION OF MAYBE

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.311
THREE OR FOUR TIMES A SUPER

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:46.384
ACCELERATED TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.986
A PROCESS.

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:48.786
THAT IS HORRIBLE I MEAN THAT IS

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:49.954
SO SLOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:50.788
STATES AROUND US WHETHER IT'S

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:51.956
UTAH IDAHO.

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:54.058
TEXAS OR ARIZONA TWO HUNDRED

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:54.826
SEVENTY DAYS I MEAN THESE TRACKS

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.427
ARE BUILT GONE AND ARE SOLD OUT

00:29:56.494 --> 00:29:58.163
BY THEM SO EVEN OUT PROCESS IT'S

00:29:58.229 --> 00:29:58.897
NOT.

00:29:58.963 --> 00:29:59.631
I JUST WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:01.733
IT'S NOT SUPER ACCELERATED AT

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.368
ALL IT'S JUST A MATTER BEING

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.770
MIRED DOWN IN BUREAUCRACY.

00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:08.039
AND AND AS MY CLOSING STATEMENT

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:09.641
THIS GET THIS BILL IS GOOD FOR

00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:11.709
CITIZENS IT'S GOOD FOR OUR FIRST

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:13.144
TIME HOME BUYERS IT'S GOOD TO

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.445
MOVE PEOPLE UP BECAUSE WE WANT

00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:15.947
TO HELP ALL BOATS THE FLOAT WE

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.482
WANNA -- WHEN WHEN YOU GET THE

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:18.783
MIDDLE CLASS UPPER MIDDLE CLASS

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.084
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS YOU WANT TO

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:21.219
GET THE LOWER CLASS?

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:22.620
RAISE THEM UP TO THE MIDDLE

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:24.355
CLASS AND POOR PEOPLE TO GET OUT

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:27.258
OF YOU KNOW -- SHELTERS AND THAT

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:28.359
KIND OF THING AND ACTUALLY GET

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:29.794
HIM IN THE HOMES AND THAT'S WHY

00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:32.163
WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS HELPS --

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.765
CONSTRUCTION FOR CALIFORNIA BE

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:35.066
COMPETITIVE IN THE HOME BUYING

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.701
MARK INSTEAD OF BEING THE THIRD

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:37.535
WORST STATE.

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.803
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MOVE UP THAT

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.172

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:52.917
EVEN IF HE WAS NOT THAT.

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:54.152
IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSING

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:55.486
CRISIS AND WE CERTAINLY HAD A

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:58.122

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:00.358
ARE SOME CASES OUT THERE WHERE

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:04.028
IT'S PROVED TO BE A CHALLENGE --

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:05.430
I DO I WILL SAVE MAYBE MAYBE

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:07.098
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE FOR BOTH OF

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:09.534
US TO JOIN HANDS AND IN ASKING --

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:12.003
FOR IT NO MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS OF

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.371
FUNDING FOR THE COURTS.

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:15.773
SO THAT THEY REALLY CAN -- YOU

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.275
KNOW BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:19.177
AND AND AND TO THE TUNE OF SEVEN

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:21.246
DAYS.

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:22.880
YEAH IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A

00:31:22.947 --> 00:31:24.315
THE REASON WE KNOCK THAT TONY

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:26.251
SEVENTY DOWN YOU KNOW.

00:31:26.317 --> 00:31:28.653
BECAUSE IT IS YES SIR MY WITNESS

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.021
MAKE A SMALL POINT ON AT HOME SO

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:32.323
IT IS NOT GONNA DO GET ORGAN

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.625
BRANCH.

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:34.225
YOU KNOW IS ONE OF THE THINGS

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:34.692
THAT.

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:36.761
CAME UP TO IN THE STUDY THAT I

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:38.463
ONCE TALKED ABOUT.

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:40.365
IN THAT SURVEY LOT OF THE

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:42.233
RESPONDENTS SPECIFICALLY ASKED

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.668
FOR LITIGATION OR LEAVE YOU KNOW

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:46.638
STREAMLINING THINGS LIKE THAT SO.

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.606
EVEN THOUGH THAT SURVEY YOU KNOW

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:49.874
DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:51.576
SIMPLIFICATION ITSELF.

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:53.778
WAS THAT HUGE OF AN IMPEDIMENT

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:54.979
I'M NOT GONNA YOU KNOW DIRECTLY.

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.147

KNOW CITY PLANNING STAFF DID

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:01.352
THINK THAT MORE STREAMLINING

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:02.987
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE ISSUE OF

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.222
GETTING.

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:05.623

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:09.027
ACTION NOW I REMEMBER.

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:10.561

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:13.197
THE EP'S SURVEY AND ALSO THE UC

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.633

BUT THEY SHOWED IS THAT IT'S

00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:19.370
VERY HARD FOR LARGER PROJECTS

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:20.805
LARGER HOUSING PROJECTS THAT

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:23.207

LARGER PROJECTS APPROVED IS

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:40.958
[inaudible]

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:43.294

USUAL COUNCIL -- ALL THE

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:21.251
COMMENTS I MADE ON THE LAST BILL

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:22.919
WOULD APPLY HERE JUST A COUPLE

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:24.254
OF VERY QUICK POINTS.

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:27.791
I'M THE AUTHOR SAID -- THAT ONE

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.659
OF THE THINGS THAT -- IS A

00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:31.161
IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THIS BILL

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:33.363
IS THE LEGAL PREDICTABILITY AND

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:34.831
CERTAINTY.

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:35.665
THAT WOULD COME WITH THIS

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:37.467
APPROACH AND AS I INDICATED

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.035
BEFORE AND I WANT TO STRESS.

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.203
IN THE LITIGATION THAT HAS

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.372
HAPPENED TODAY UNDER THE

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:44.408
STREAMLINING PROVISIONS.

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:45.742
THAT CERTAINTY IS NOT THERE

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.244
SUBSCRIBE TO IT ANY PROJECT

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.945
THAT'S HIGHLY CONTESTED THERE

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:50.313
WILL BE BOTH THE QUIT AND NON

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.715
SEQUEL CAUSES OF ACTION AND

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:52.983
LAWSUITS FILED.

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:53.950
IT WILL NOT PROVIDE THE

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:56.553
CERTAINTY THAT THEY ARE SEEKING

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.088
WE DO APPRECIATE THE ALL THE THE

00:50:58.155 --> 00:50:59.589
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AT THE VERY

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:01.525
END OF THE BILL -- THE AUTHOR'S

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:02.859
INTENT TENAX SUBSEQUENT

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:04.327
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:05.796
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE COURTS

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:06.830
FOR HANDLING SEE WHAT CASES BUT

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.432
AS I POINTEDOUT.

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:10.000
THAT'S REALLY NOT OUR GOAL AND

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.868
WE WE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:14.371
THE SENTIMENT -- BUT I THINK

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:16.072
GOING OUT IN FUNDING AND PUTTING

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:17.741
CONSTRAINTS ON THE FUNDING FOR

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.776
PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF CASES

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:21.845
IS A REALLY INEFFICIENT WAY OF

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.146
TRYING TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL.

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:24.648
ISSUES WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.216
STREAMLINING MECHANISMS THAT

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:27.284
COULD BE DONE THAT WOULD BE

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:28.318
HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:30.520
LEGISLATURE ON BUT RESPECTFULLY

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:31.488
THIS LIKE WHAT WHAT KIND OF

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:35.926
THINGS.

00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:36.493
LIKE WHAT KIND OF THINGS WE

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.093
THINK WOULD WORK. ONE OF THE

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.861
AREAS IN WHICH WE'VE TALKED

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:38.395
ABOUT THIS A BIT.

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:40.797
UNDER CURRENT LAW OF THE AS I

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:42.165
MENTIONED THE PREPARATION THERE

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:43.700
AND FIGHTS ABOUT THE RECORD OF

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.936
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST AREA OF

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:48.038
FRIDAY AND SEE. ONE CONCEPT

00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:49.306
THAT'S BEEN FLOATED THERE'S NOT

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:50.974
A COUNCIL SPONSORED PROPOSAL BY

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.609
ANY MEANS BECAUSE IT'S DEALING

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.177
WITH SICK WITH SUBSTANTIVELY.

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:55.312
BUT OUR EXPERTS BIRDS OF

00:51:55.378 --> 00:51:58.215
IDENTIFIED THAT THAT UNDER

00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.649
SEAQUEST OPPOSED TO MOST.

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:00.984
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY KIND OF

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:02.953
PROCESS AND YOU HAVE BOTH THE

00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:05.655
PUBLIC AGENCY AND THE PETITIONER.

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:07.524
BEING ALLOWED TO PREPARE.

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.759
THE RECORD -- WE SEE A LOT OF

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:11.595
DELAY COMING WITH THE PETITIONER

00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:13.830
PREPARATION THE RECORD ISSUES IF

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:15.265
IT WAS JUST THE PUBLIC AGENCY

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:16.833
NOT CONSULTED WITH THE NUMBER OF

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:17.467
SICK WITH EXPERT ATTORNEYS

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:18.201
INCLUDING.

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:19.669
ATTORNEYS THAT REPRESENTED THE

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:21.771
WARRIORS AND OTHER LITIGATION ON

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.440
BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION AND

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:26.810
THEY DO AGREE THAT THE BIGGEST

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:28.078
AREA OF DELAY.

00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:28.945
HAS TO DO WITH FIGHTS OVER THE

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:30.213
RECORD MOTION TO A LARGE AND

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.381
CERTIFY THE RECORD IT CETERA.

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.416
AND SOONE THING THAT WE THINK

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:35.085
RESPECTFULLY SHOULD BE EXPLORED.

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:37.120
IS THIS ISSUE OF WHETHER WE WANT

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:38.588
TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW PETITIONERS

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:40.790
OF THE ABLE TO PREPARE AND

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:41.658
CERTIFY THE RECORD IN THESE

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:43.393
CASES AS OPPOSED TO THE PUBLIC

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.661
AGENCY WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS IN

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.263
VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER.

TO COURT VIA A RED THE ISSUE

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.802
THERE IS A PUBLIC AGENCY DOESN'T

WANT TAKE ON THAT BURDEN IS THAT.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.505
THERE MAY BE THERE MAY BE COST

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.107
ISSUES THAT WOULD NEED TO BE

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:58.208
ADDRESSED AS PART OF THAT AGAIN

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.509
IT'S NOT.

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:00.777
IT'S NOT A COUNCIL SPONSOR

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:02.212
PROPOSAL BUT WE WE HAVE BEEN

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:04.281

COULD TRULY STREAMLINE AS

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:08.518
OPPOSED TO THIS APPROACH.

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:09.853

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.722

IN OUR DISCUSSION IS -- YOU KNOW.

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:13.876
WE AT THE THOUGHT HERE IS THAT

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:15.511
WE'VE GOT A GOVERNOR WHO'S MADE

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:18.214
A VERY BOLD -- STATEMENT ABOUT

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.350
WANTING TO REALLY ADDRESS THE

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:21.584
HOUSING ISSUES THAT ARE AT PLAY

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:23.286
AND AND YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.922
FACTORS AS WE ALL DISCUSSES

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.158
NORMALCY BECAUSE YOU KNOW MAYBE.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.326
THIS BABY SECRET BEING BY FAR

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:31.594
TOO MUCH HERE IN THIS DISCUSSION

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:32.829
BUT AT THE AT THE SAME TIME --

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:33.863
WE WE WE REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.199
THIS IS FOCUSED ON ON ON HOUSING.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.767
I HAVE A WE ALSO ARE AWARE OF

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.969
THE FACT THAT HOUSING PROJECTS

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:40.937
AND YOU KNOW.

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:42.305
PENCIL OUT MUCH.

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.307
MUCH BETTER IF THERE'S A CERTAIN

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.542
DEGREE MIXED USE AND IN FACT.

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:49.245
IF IF IT'S PROPERLY PLANNED YOU

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:52.115
CAN HAVE A YOU KNOW A MORE

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.082
SUSTAINABLE.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.384
SET UP -- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.185
PEOPLE ON A WALK TO WORK AND GET

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.153
BUY THEIR GROCERIES ETCETERA --

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:57.787
RIGHT THERE NEXT TO IT NEXT TO

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.822
WHERE THEY LIVE AND WE WANT TO I

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:00.656
THINK WE SEE THIS AS AN

01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:02.291
OPPORTUNITY TO GET A LOT MORE

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.027
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY HOUSING

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:04.794
PROJECTS OUT THERE.

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.262
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ALLOW FOR

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:07.430
A CERTAIN DEGREE MIXED USE WILL

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.033
HELP TO FINANCE THAT WERE OPEN

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:10.967
TO THAT DISCUSSION RIGHT SO THE

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:16.005
PROPHET THERE'S A PROHIBITION

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.373
NOW ON MAKES USE.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.408
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT WE MAY

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.009
ALLOW SOME EXCUSE WHATEVER THAT

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:20.676
VOLUME IS THAT [inaudible]

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:21.677
FAIR.

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:24.847
WITH REGARD TO THE TWO HUNDRED

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:26.182
SEVENTY DAYS JUDICIAL REVIEW.

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.451
HI I'VE HEARD ALL THE ANALOGY IS

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:32.388
ABOUT THE NEW BILLIONAIRE --

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:33.289
STADIUM PROJECTS BUT THAT'S ONE

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.124
PROJECT.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.325
THIS ONE PROJECT AND IT'S A

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.294
JUDICIAL REVIEW THERE'S ONE IN

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.695
LA TWO SETS TO PROJECT BUT

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:40.663
THEY'RE SIMPLE REVIEW.

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.597
WHEN I READ THE LANGUAGE HERE

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:43.299
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YES IF

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.434
THERE'S SOMEBODY CHALLENGES THE

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.070
E. I. R. THEY GET EXPEDITED?

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:50.139
REVIEW THAT'S ONE ISSUE BUT IT'S

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.275
FOR ANY OR GRANTING THE APPROVAL

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.276
OF THE HOUSING PROJECT.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:54.710
SO THAT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:57.213
DIFFERENT -- SITUATION BECAUSE

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:57.713
NOW YOU HAVE FIFTY EIGHT

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.516
COUNTIES. FOUR HUNDRED NINETY

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:05.488
TWO CITIES ALL THAT MAY HAVE A I

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:08.424
DID OBJECTION TO THE PROJECT.

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.425
AND JUST BECAUSE IT'S A HOUSING

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:10.993
PROJECT.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.730
THEN IT GETS THE THE MAGIC --

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:18.034
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS.

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:21.504
THIS IS THE AM I READING THE

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:22.338
LANGUAGE RIGHT IS THAT WHAT THE

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.073
INTENT IS HERE THAT WE WANT TO

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:28.444
MAKE SURE THAT ANYBODY THAT SAYSTHIS IS A HOUSING PROJECT WE GET.

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:29.712
WE GET TO THE TOP LINE

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.647
REGARDLESS WHETHER THE OTHER

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:32.815
PRIORITIES ARE IN THE COURTS THE

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.484
TERMS THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.120
BILL IN THE AMENDMENT.

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:37.286
YES.

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:39.222
OKAY.

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:41.023
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S A DEAL

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.191
BREAKER FOR ME.

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:46.262
THAT'S THAT'S NOT THAT'S I GET

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.864
THE ENTHUSIASM THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:52.502
OVER IT AND I GET THE AND I WILL.

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:53.636
WE'LL DEAL WITH THE ANALOGIES

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:55.204
BETWEEN A SPORTS A BILLION OR

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.806
SPORTS CENTER IT'S VERY NICE

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.508
VERY GREAT ON TWITTER AND ALL

01:02:58.574 --> 01:02:59.775
THAT TYPE OF STUFF BUT IT'S A

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:00.843
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE FOR THE

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:02.378
COURTS TO SAY.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.747
EVERY PROJECT IF WE JUST UP WHAT

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.115
WHAT THIS COURT SYSTEMS ARE MADE

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.284
THAT WAY FORGET.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:11.554
FORGET TO SEEK WORK IN ON OTHER

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.557
WITH RESPECT TO SENATOR -- THAT

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:15.758
IT WAS A STUDY DONE LAST YEAR

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.126
YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT --

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:20.296
POINTED OUT HOW FEW CHALLENGES.

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:24.033
SO -- AND I I WOULD NOTE THAT

AND THE COMPLEX LITIGATION OF

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:43.346
THE ONES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:44.113
ADDRESS.

SEVEN DAY RULE UNDER YOUR BELT.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.794

FRANKLY AND IN A COMPELLING

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:03.466
RIGHT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THIS

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.368
ARGUMENT THAT.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.770
ANY ANY LITIGATION MANY COMPLEX

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:08.904
LITIGATION WORTH ITS SALT SALT

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:11.407
WILL HAVE -- MULTIPLE CAUSES THE

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:13.109
GATE AT CLEANING ON ON SEA QUEST

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:15.378
AND THIS WILL SPEED UP THE

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:16.078
pPROCESS AT ALL.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:17.113
WELL I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:18.214
THAT YOU'VE REQUESTED -- LIMIT

01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:19.815
THAT OPTION BECAUSE YOU'VE

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:20.850
INDICATED.

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:22.418
THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO BE LIMITED

HUNDRED RESIDENTIAL UNITS.

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.857
NOEL I LARGER THAN FIVE ACRES SO

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:28.824
THERE'S LIMITS THAT YOU'RE

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:30.626
PUTTING IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:31.927
I THINK.

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:33.362
MAKES THE LIKELIHOOD OF COMPLEX

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.698
LITIGATION MUCH MUCH LESS.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.166
AND THAT THAT OF COURSE ALWAYS

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:38.668
REMAINS A POSSIBILITY ALL WE'RE

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:41.337
TRYING TO DO IS GIVE SOME --

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.104
GREATER CONFIDENCE TO THE

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:43.172
PRIVATE.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.674

AFFORDABLE IS IT WORTH OF MY

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:52.448
CAPITAL IS THE RISK WORTH IT. TO

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:53.783
DO AND SO.

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.184
YOU'VE CREATED SOME BRACKETS

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.987
WITHIN THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.188
LEGISLATION.

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.089
THAT DO LIMIT THE EXPOSURE AT

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.357
SOME LEVEL AT BUT IT'S ALWAYS

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:02.725
THERE AND THAT'S THAT GONNA BE

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:03.392
THAT QUESTION AT THE END OF THE

01:07:08.724 --> 01:07:09.759
IMPORTANT STREAMLINING TO SEE

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:11.427
QUALIFICATION BY PROVIDING

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:20.169
AS YOU WELL KNOW CALIFORNIA IS

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:21.370
IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.005
THAN THE COST OF RENTING A HOME

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:23.906
IN CALIFORNIA IS AN ALL TIME

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:24.507
HIGH.

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:26.642
IN MY COMMUNITY IT'S TWO

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.879
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A TWO

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.580
BEDROOM APARTMENT -- WHICH

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:33.616
USUALLY HOUSES MANY MANY ADULTS

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:34.383
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.351
THAT.

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:37.953
ON IT HOME OWNERSHIP IS ALSO AT

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.889
ITS LOWEST RATE SINCE THE

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:40.589
NINETEEN FORTIES AND WHAT THAT

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.625
MEANS IS THAT THE BENEFIT OF THE

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:44.293
GI BILL HAS BEEN TOTALLY.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.694
ELIMINATED BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.229
KEPT UP WITH THE WITH THE

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:50.065
CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING FOR TO

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.400
MEET OUR WORKFORCE NEEDS.

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.902
THIS OBVIOUSLY IS DUE TO A

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.303
VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.205
INCREASED COST OF LAND MATERIALS

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:57.773
ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND THE

BROUGHT SOMETIMES.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:02.611
AUSPICIOUSLY UNDERSEA QUOTE.

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:04.013
WELL I VALUE AND SUPPORT THE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS OF SEA

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.782
QUEST AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.684
THAT BECAUSE I THINK SEQUENCE

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.085
SERVES A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.620
FUNCTION IN OUR STATE.

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:13.189
AND IT T REALLY GIVES

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.624
COMMUNITIES AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:16.292
LOOK AT THE PROJECT CAN YOU

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.194
DECIDE HOW TO MITIGATE ANY

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.228
IMPACTS.

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:21.197
IT'S BEEN OFTEN USED BY NIMBIS

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:22.965
TO SLOW STALL FRUSTRATE AND

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.433
OFTEN KILL PROJECTS FOR REASONS

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.167
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.535
INSUFFICIENT ENVIRONMENTAL

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:27.636
MITIGATION.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:28.871
AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.640

ANALYSIS RAISES MANY PAUL MANY

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:21.650
POINTS IN THERE THERE'S TOO MANY

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.085
TO KIND OF GO THROUGH THIS --

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:24.853
TODAY BUT I'M ABLE TO DISCUSS A

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:25.854

OF THOSE AS THE BILL PROCEEDED

TO GETS OUT OF EQ TODAY -- IN

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:51.680
PARTICULAR AND THE THAT THE

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:54.016
NUMBERS AND THEY NEED TO WORK IN

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:54.917
THE REAL WORLD AND I WANT TO BE

PERCENT GM YEAH THE PRESENTING

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:02.391
THE PERCENTAGE IN THE AM I AND

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:03.392
AND THE REASON.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:04.827
IS I I'M YES IS IS AND I YOU

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:05.995
SOME TIME.

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:07.062
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:09.698
WITH -- DEVELOPERS THAT ARE

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.367
BUILT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.635
AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IT

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.003
THIS REALLY GETS TO THE ROOT OF

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.704
THE ISSUE IS THAT WHEN THEY WHEN

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.272
THEY LOOK OVER A FIVE OR A TEN

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.574
YEAR HORIZON.

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:19.108
THEY THEY HAVE TO BUY THE

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.609
PROPERTY TODAY TO TO BE ABLE TO

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:21.410
BUILD.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.012
X. NUMBER OF YEARS DOWN THE ROAD

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:25.814
SO IF THEY'RE BUILDING TODAY

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:26.649
THEY BOUGHT THE PROPERTY QUITE A

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:28.517
BIT AGO AND WHAT THEY LOOK AT IS

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:31.120
WHAT IS THE RISK IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.422
SO THAT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ARE --

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.324
AND AT PUTTING TOGETHER THE

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:37.126
MONEY TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS --

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:39.294
CAN I DO IT EASIER AND MAKE A

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:40.629
BETTER RATE OF RETURN SOMEWHERE

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:42.998
ELSE OR IS THE BURDEN INTO OF

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:44.900
DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA SO

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.101
MUCH THAT I CAN I'M GONNA KEEP A

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.436
LIMITED SUPPLY.

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.805
OF LAND AND INVESTMENT MONEY IN

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:51.140
CALIFORNIA AND SO WHAT WE NEED

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.074
TO DO IS.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.575
REALLY IT'S A BIGGER PICTURE

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:55.744
WHICH IS ASCERTAIN WHAT THE RISK

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.846
IS OF INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.416
AND AND PART OF THE PART OF THIS

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:01.917
IS TO REDUCE THAT RISK.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:04.053
SO THAT THEY SEE A WAITING TO BE

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:05.688

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:29.157
WHERE THE PROJECT WOULD STOP?

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:30.525
WELL I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.261
WE'RE NEARLY READY TO SEND OUT

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:32.794
INVITATIONS TO OUR GROUND

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.830
BREAKING IT'S BEEN A LONG HARD

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:36.098
FOUGHT EFFORT TO GET TO THIS

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.499
POINT.

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:38.834
OVER A YEAR AND A HALF BEHIND

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:41.203
SCHEDULE.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.571
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:44.339
OUT THAT BY THE TIME WE SERVE WE

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:45.874
WERE SERVED WITH THE LAWSUIT THE

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:47.276
PROJECT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:48.844
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:51.313
METICULOUSLY REVIEWED.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.749
NONE THE LESS AND NONE THE LESS.

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.584
OOPS MY MY RUN PATIENT.

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.552
AND UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:58.587
PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:00.455
COUNCIL.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.190
THE LAWSUIT CAME IN LATE BASED

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:03.859
ON LATE COMMENTS.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.260
WE WERE LUCKY AS WE WERE ABLE TO

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.396
SETTLE ON A VERY FAVORABLE TERMS

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:08.997
WHICH IMPORTANTLY DID NOT

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:11.366
REQUIRE US. TO WE HAD ALREADY

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:13.602
REDUCED THE NUMBERS OF HOMES

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:14.202
THROUGH OUR CONVERSATIONS OVER

01:16:14.269 --> 01:16:15.704
TIME.

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:16.638
THIS WAS PROBABLY FOR THREE

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.573
REASONS ONE BECAUSE OF THE

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.775
STRONG SUPPORT OF HABITAT

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.343
HOMEOWNERS IN THE COMMUNITY

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:21.944
THERE WERE FIFTY FOUR ALREADY

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.478
THERE.

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:25.247
HUNDREDS OF VOLUNTEERS.

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.615
AND HUNDREDS OF SUPPORTERS AND

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.583
DONORS WHO SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:31.253
HABIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.554
AND BECAUSE THEY GOT THERE IS

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:33.989
THEY STILL WANT OTHERS TO GET

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:36.959
THERE. TWO BECAUSE OF THE PRO

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:38.593
BONO COUNSEL A LAW FIRM THAT WAS

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.094
COMMITTED TO TAKING OUR

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:40.829
OPPONENTS IN LITIGATION ON THE

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.097
WAY TO TRIAL.

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.098
AND THREE BECAUSE OF THE

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.067
STRENGTH OF THE HABITAT BRAND

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:45.734
WHICH MEANT THAT WE COULD SPEAK

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:47.402
OUT LOUDLY AND IN PUBLIC ABOUT

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:48.603
THE INJUSTICE.

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.505
EVIDENT IN THE APPLICATION OF

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:52.607
THE WELL INTENTIONED BUT ABUSE

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:53.976
LAW.

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:54.910
NONE THE LESS THE COST HAD

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:56.678
ESCALATED BY THEN TO MILLIONS OF

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:58.146
DOLLARS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTSUM

01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.381
IN THE OVERHEATED BAY AREA

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.615
HOUSING MARKET.

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:02.017
ALL FOR A DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:04.019
THE FEATURED NO LEGITIMATE

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:05.821
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. FOR TOO

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:07.422
MANY AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS IN

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:08.757
CALIFORNIA CIVIL LAWSUITS OF THE

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:11.126
COST OF DOING BUSINESS SIMPLY BY

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:12.361
ISSUING A LAWSUIT THE PLAINTIFF

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:13.996
CAN WREAK HAVOC ON A PROJECT.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:15.030
AND OFTEN THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:17.065
EXTRACT SUBSTANTIAL CONCESSIONS

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.300
FROM DEVELOPERS.

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:20.335
DEVELOPERS EITHER FINANCIAL OR

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.037
REDUCED NUMBERS OF HOMES OR MANY

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:23.872
TIMES BOTH.

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:26.008
AND BY DEVELOPERS I MEAN HABITAT

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:27.509
FOR HUMANITY A DECADE STRONG

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:28.977
NONPROFIT THAT PUTS FAMILIES

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:30.145
FIRST.

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:32.180
NOT SOMEONE BUILDING A BALLPARK.

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.115
MORE TO THE POINT THE MERE

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:34.816
THREAT OF CIVIL LITIGATION HAS A

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:36.284
REAL IMPAT ON THOSE MARGINAL

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:37.986
DEVELOPMENTS NOT UNDERTAKING AT

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:39.454
ALL BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF A

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:40.789
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.758
RENDERS THEM ECONOMICALLY

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.426
UNREALISTIC AT THE OUTSET.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.694
I HAVE TO SAY THIS LAWSUIT WOULD

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.162
SIMPLY HAVE BLOWN ANY OTHER

TIME IS INEFFICIENT AND NOT

01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:19.179
SUSTAINABLE.

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:20.647
SB SIX SIX NINE WOULD PROVIDE A

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:22.316

AGENCIES WE SUPPORT THE BILL

01:40:52.012 --> 01:40:55.382
WERE A CO SPONSOR WITH CMU WAY.

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:57.251
EVERYBODY WHO'S WORKING ON THIS

01:40:57.317 --> 01:40:59.253
ISSUE AGREES THAT THERE IS A

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:00.821
REAL PROBLEM THAT HAS TO BE

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:02.089
SOLVED.

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:03.757
EVERYBODY WHO'S WORKING ON THIS

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:05.125
ISSUE AGREES THERE NEED TO BE

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.627
NEEDS TO BE A FUNDING SOLUTIONS

THIS YEAR.

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:09.463
AND WE APPRECIATE THIS

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:11.799
COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THAT TOPIC

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:13.901
WE THINK THAT THE TRUST PROPOSED

01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:16.737
AN SP SIX SIX NINE IS A GOOD

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:18.505
SOLUTION.

01:41:18.572 --> 01:41:20.574
IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO THE THE

01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:21.875
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUMMARY

01:41:21.942 --> 01:41:23.076
DOCUMENT.

01:41:23.143 --> 01:41:25.712
THERE'S A QUOTE AT PAGE ONE

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:26.547
TWENTY SIX THE SAYS THE MOST

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:28.515
SIGNIFICANT REMAINING CHALLENGE

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:30.517
IS THE LACK OF STABLE FUNDING

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:33.287
SOURCE FOR LONG TERM OPERATION

01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:35.255
AND MAINTENANCE COSTS.

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:37.090
OF DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS.

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:39.193
NO THIS BILL SB SIX SIX NINE IS

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:41.829
NOT LIMITED TO FUNDING OPERATION

01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:43.130
AND MAINTENANCE COSTS BUT IT

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:45.532
WOULD ADDRESS THAT HE FUNDING

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:46.600
GAP.

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.569
SP SIX SIX NINE FOCUSES ON

01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:50.771
COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:53.507
CHRONICALLY VIOLATE THE FEDERAL

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:54.475
OR STATE DRINKING WATER

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:55.876
STANDARDS IN SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:57.611
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT

01:41:57.678 --> 01:41:58.645
REALLY NEED.

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:01.181
FUNDING ASSISTANCE IT WOULD

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:03.784
ADDRESS -- IN INCLUDE NITRATE IN

01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.686
ITS SCOPE AND IT INCLUDES THE

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:06.620
OTHER.

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:08.689
CONTAMINANTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE

01:42:08.755 --> 01:42:11.792
FEDERAL OR STATE DRINKING WATER

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:13.093
STANDARDS.

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.728
THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROVIDE

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:17.764
FUNDING FOR CONSOLIDATION AND

01:42:17.831 --> 01:42:19.333
CONSOLIDATIONS AS THIS COMMITTEE

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:21.668
KNOWS WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

01:42:21.735 --> 01:42:24.638
SYSTEMS THAT WOULD NEED

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:25.672
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

01:42:25.739 --> 01:42:26.206
FUNDING.

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:28.075
SO THAT'S A POSITIVE ASPECT AS

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:31.044
WELL IT'S ALSO HAS FUNDING FOR

01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:33.380
REPLACEMENT WATER AND FOR

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:36.550
ADMINISTRATOR OR MANAGERIAL --

01:42:36.617 --> 01:42:38.652
CONTRACTORS.

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.454
NO THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE AN

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:42.923
ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM TO

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.158
PROPOSALS FOR WATER TAX RIGHT

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:46.927
NOW IN THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:49.096
TWO OF THOSE ONE IS IN BUDGET

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:50.497
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:52.866
THAT LANGUAGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO

01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:54.167
THE LANGUAGE THAT THE BROWN

01:42:54.234 --> 01:42:56.937
ADMINISTRATION HAD LAST YEAR AND

01:42:57.004 --> 01:42:58.405
THAT DID NOT PASS.

01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:00.040
THERE'S ALSO A WATER TAX

01:43:00.107 --> 01:43:03.877
PROPOSED IN EIGHTY TWO SEVENTEEN

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:04.478
ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE.

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:06.446
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WITH

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:08.181
THE PROPOSAL FOR A TRUST IS A

01:43:08.248 --> 01:43:10.584
BETTER APPROACH FOR MANY REASONS

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:12.319
THE Q. ONE THAT'LL MENTION FOR

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:14.021
THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT.

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:16.156
THE TRUST WOULD NOT ADD TO THE

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:18.458
COST OF WATER IT WOULDN'T MAKE

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:20.494
WATER LESS AFFORDABLE IN

01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:22.229
CALIFORNIA WE THINK THAT'S VERY

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:25.198
IMPORTANT OF COURSE SENATOR

01:43:25.265 --> 01:43:27.034
CAFIERO MENTIONED THAT.

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:29.937
ON WITH THE RECENT -- IN RECORD

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:31.538
BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR WE

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:32.806
THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:34.808
LEGISLATURE CAN FUND THE TRUST

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:37.244
WITH A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT

01:43:37.311 --> 01:43:38.111
BUDGET SURPLUS.

01:43:38.178 --> 01:43:40.013
SO WE ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.549
MOVE THE BILL IT'S A GOOD

01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:44.084
SOLUTION WE ARE TONIGHT.

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:45.852
THANK YOU.

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:50.390
NOW NO MORE BIRTHDAY BASH.

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:51.491
YEAH.

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:53.627
ALTHOUGH I GOT A TIARA BIRTHDAY

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:55.195
WEEK BUT THE BIRTHDAY WEEK NO I

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:56.630
I WOULD LOVE A BIRTHDAY MONTH

01:43:56.697 --> 01:43:57.297
THAT OKAY ALL RIGHT THERE YOU GO

01:43:57.364 --> 01:43:57.998
OKAY.

01:43:58.065 --> 01:43:59.299
BUT I DID HAVE A VERY NICE

01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:01.635
BIRTHDAY THANK YOU HEARD OF MY

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:02.536
NAME IS DANIEL BLASTED WITH

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:03.136
CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:04.638
ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD OF

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:06.406
BECAUSE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS

01:44:06.473 --> 01:44:08.308
OF SB -- SIX SIX NINE AS

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:10.110
OUTLINED BY THE AUTHOR AND OUR

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:11.878
CO SPONSOR WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:13.513
IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.616
NEEDS TO BE SOLVED -- THE

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:16.483
SENATOR IN OUR COSPONSORED DID A

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:17.951
GREAT JOB EXPLAINING THE TRUST

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:20.120
SO I AM GOING TO FOCUS A LITTLE

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:21.588
BIT ON THE CONCERNS FROM THE

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:23.223
OPPOSITION WE ASK THE SERGEANT

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:25.225
TO DISTRIBUTED DOCUMENT TO ALL

01:44:25.292 --> 01:44:26.660
OF YOU TODAY.

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.996
IT OUTLINES THOSE -- CONCERNS

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:30.731
AND OUR RESPONSES IN DETAIL BUT

01:44:30.797 --> 01:44:32.432
I'M GONNA FOCUS ON JUST A COUPLE

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:34.401
TODAY -- THERE'S A CONCERN THAT

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:35.736
THE PRESS DOESN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH

01:44:35.802 --> 01:44:37.671
FUNDING BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:44:37.738 --> 01:44:38.872
FIRST ADDRESS THE EXISTING

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:41.108
ESTIMATES TO TRY AND TACKLE THE

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:42.309
FUNDING NEEDED -- THESE

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:44.578
ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY BETWEEN

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:45.579
FORTY THREE AND A HUNDRED AND

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:47.848
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THE

01:44:47.914 --> 01:44:48.348
FORTY THREE MILLION WAS

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:48.882
DEVELOPED THROUGH A NEEDS

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:50.984
ASSESSMENT BY THE STATE WATER

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:52.452
BOARD.

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:53.620
AND AS FOR AN M. COST -- WHICH

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.422
AS WAS NOTED IS THE MAJOR

01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:57.524
FUNDING GAP THE HUNDRED AND

01:44:57.591 --> 01:44:58.892
FORTY MILLION ACTUALLY INCLUDES

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:02.362
ONAM COSTS AND AND CAPITAL COSTS

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:02.929
FOR WHICH THERE IS ALREADY

01:45:02.996 --> 01:45:03.797
FINDING.

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:05.832
AND WAS GENERATED BY A THIRD

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:07.901
PARTY -- CONSULTANT AND IN THE

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.369
CONSULTANTS ESTIMATE THERE WAS

01:45:09.436 --> 01:45:10.604
AN ADMISSION THAT THERE'S NO

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:11.571
STATEWIDE STUDY YOUR

01:45:11.638 --> 01:45:13.273
COMPREHENSIVE DATA QUANTIFY THE

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:14.207
COST.

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:15.208
AND IN ADDITION THE STATE WATER

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:17.778
BOARD SAID IN THEIR TWO THOUSAND

01:45:17.844 --> 01:45:19.513
FIFTEEN SAFE DRINKING WATER PLAN.

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:21.381
THE COSTS OF REQUIRING PUBLIC

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.417
WATER SYSTEMS SERVING LESS THAN

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:24.818
TEN THOUSAND SERVICE CONNECTIONS

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:26.153
TO ME PRIMARY DRINKING WATER

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:28.188
STANDARDS CANNOT BE ACCURATELY

01:45:28.255 --> 01:45:36.296
ESTIMATED GIVEN THE VARIABLES

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:37.998
INVOLVED IN SUCH AN ESTIMATE.

01:45:38.065 --> 01:45:38.832
AS NOTED IN NEED NEEDS

01:45:38.899 --> 01:45:39.666
ASSESSMENT BY THE BOARD IS UNDER

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.702
WAY BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE TOTAL

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:42.602
NEED IS NOT FROM YOU FOR ME IT

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:43.470
FIRMLY BEEN ESTABLISHED.

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:44.171
AS ENVISIONED THE TRUST WOULD

01:45:44.237 --> 01:45:45.072
GENERATE MORE THAN THE AMOUNT

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:45.839
ESTIMATED BY THE STATE BOARD AND

01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:46.640
IF MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED IN THE

01:45:46.707 --> 01:45:48.175
FUTURE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE.

01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:49.743
THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT

01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:50.777
PRECLUDE THE LEGISLATURE FROM

01:45:50.844 --> 01:45:53.747
ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE

01:45:53.814 --> 01:45:54.981
TRUST TO GENERATE THAT AMOUNT.

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:56.850
AND LASTLY THERE'S ALSO CONCERNS

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:58.752
THAT THE TRUST IS LIMITED IN THE

01:45:58.819 --> 01:46:00.287
UNIVERSE OF SYSTEMS THAT WOULD

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:02.289
BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING -- I

01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:03.890
THINK THAT AS SENATOR CAFIERO

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:05.525
INTERPOSE SPONSOR OUTLINES I'M

01:46:05.592 --> 01:46:07.427
OUR POSITION ON THAT BUT WE DO

01:46:07.494 --> 01:46:09.096
BELIEVE THE NEW ASSESSMENT IS

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:11.364
EXPECTED TO EXPLORE WAYS TO

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:13.133
ASSESS AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.167
PRIVATE WELLS AND STATE SMALL

01:46:14.234 --> 01:46:15.235
SYSTEMS.

01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:17.070
INCLUDING CONSOLIDATION WHICH WE

01:46:17.137 --> 01:46:19.372
BELIEVE -- WOULD BE THE SOLUTION

01:46:19.439 --> 01:46:21.274
FOR MANY OF THESE AREAS AND

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:22.709
WOULD REDUCE THE OVERALL NEED.

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:24.478
AND WE BELIEVE THE TRUST -- IS A

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.213
BETTER APPROACH FOR SOLVING THIS

01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:28.081
ISSUE IT DOES NOT RELY ON A

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:29.549
REGRESSIVE TAX ON WATER.

01:46:29.616 --> 01:46:31.752
AND I WOULD PROVIDE THE FUNDING

01:46:31.818 --> 01:46:32.919
NEEDED FOR SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BY

01:46:32.986 --> 01:46:34.321
BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:35.822
BOARD IS NEEDING ASSISTANCE I

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:38.658
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I'VE

BILLION DOLLARS.

01:54:31.497 --> 01:54:32.799
IT WOULD BE BOTH THE GREATEST

01:54:32.865 --> 01:54:34.634
IRONY AND A GRAVE INJUSTICE AT

THOUGHTS -- A CINEMA CASKEY.

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.377
THE LECTURE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:01:24.443 --> 02:01:26.779
INCLUDED ON THIS BILL -- WE

02:01:26.846 --> 02:01:28.414
DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION WITH THE

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:30.116
STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD I'M.

02:01:30.182 --> 02:01:31.884
AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD CUT

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:33.686
THIS ONCE WHEN WE ASK ONE OF THE

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:35.955

TO SO WE HAVE A BALANCE.

02:01:38.224 --> 02:01:40.459
THE QUESTION.

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:41.560
FOR AGAIN IT'S A NICE LECTURE

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:43.195
ABOUT THE MILLION PEOPLE THAT

02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:44.864
DON'T HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER

02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:47.733
BUT THERE'S ONLY FIVE HUNDRED

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.502
THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDER

02:01:49.568 --> 02:01:50.803
THE JURISDICTION THE STATE WATER

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:53.139
RESOURCE BOARD WHICH WE HAVE

02:01:53.205 --> 02:01:54.640
JURISDICTION TO DO SOMETHING.

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:55.708
IS THAT CORRECT.

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.243
THE AUTHOR.

02:01:57.309 --> 02:01:58.744
IN THE MORNING TILL IN EVERY

02:01:58.811 --> 02:02:00.579
BILL THAT'S COME BEFORE US ARE

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:01.847
BILLS THAT ARE TAILORED FOR

02:02:01.914 --> 02:02:02.915
AREAS THAT THE STATE OF

02:02:02.982 --> 02:02:04.950
CALIFORNIA HAS JURISDICTION OVER

02:02:05.017 --> 02:02:08.154
RIGHT IS THAT CORRECT.

02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:08.788
WELL I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE MINING

02:02:08.854 --> 02:02:10.623
BILL.

02:02:10.690 --> 02:02:12.958
IT'S NOT FAIR BUT RIGHT NOW BUT

02:02:13.025 --> 02:02:15.428
IT IS WITH THE SAME UNIVERSE.

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:16.462
PART OF WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:18.064
PART OF THE OBJECTION HERE IS

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:20.099
THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE WELLS THAT

02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:21.600
ARE NOT THAT ARE NON POSSIBLE

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:22.568
WATER.

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:24.036
THEY WANT THIS BILL TO FIX IT

02:02:24.103 --> 02:02:25.204
AND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SYSTEMS

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:27.773
THAT HAVE 14% OR FOURTEEN HOOK

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:28.841
UPS THAT ARE UNDER THE

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:29.975
JURISDICTION OF STATE WATER

02:02:30.042 --> 02:02:31.544
RESOURCE BOARD WHAT YOUR BILL

02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:32.244
THE FIX IT.

02:02:32.311 --> 02:02:33.512
AND PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVE WATER

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:35.414
SYSTEM ONE RUN BY A RAILROAD

02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:37.083
VERSUS THE STATE WATER RESEARCH

02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:38.517
ESTATE COMMUNITY BOARD WHAT YOUR

02:02:38.584 --> 02:02:41.220
BILL FIX IT AND MY UNDERSTANDING

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:42.621
PLEASE CORRECT ME IS THAT WE%

02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:44.657
DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION. TO DO

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:45.891
THAT.

02:02:45.958 --> 02:02:47.059
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:48.494
SO SO THAT'S A DIFFERENT

02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:49.829
SOLUTION THAT'S A DIFFERENT

02:02:49.895 --> 02:02:50.896
THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT I'D SAY

02:02:50.963 --> 02:02:52.298
THAT'S THAT'S IT WE'RE BEING

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:54.433
URGED TO OPPOSE THIS FOR IT ONLY

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:55.701
FIX IS HALF OF THE PROBLEM.

02:02:55.768 --> 02:02:58.137
AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF BILLS

02:02:58.204 --> 02:03:00.339
ON CONSOLIDATION INCLUDING EVERY

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:02.341
SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S A WATER

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:04.110
DISTRICT HAS NO REASON

02:03:04.176 --> 02:03:05.878
WHATSOEVER WHATSOEVER SCHOOL

02:03:05.945 --> 02:03:06.846
DISTRICT.

02:03:06.912 --> 02:03:08.147
HAVING A OF WATER DISTRICT THAT

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:10.049
DOESN'T JOIN AN ADJOINING WATER

02:03:10.116 --> 02:03:10.950
DISTRICT AND YOU'VE DONE

02:03:11.016 --> 02:03:12.218
LEGISLATION AND I'VE DONE

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:13.819
LEGISLATION AND THEY'LL BE MORE

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:15.287
LEGISLATION FOR THE SCHOOL

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:16.255
DISTRICTS.

02:03:16.322 --> 02:03:17.923
TO CONSOLIDATE AND JOIN BUT

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:20.292
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:21.160
INTENDED TO DO.

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:21.927
I HAVE OTHER REASONS TO OPPOSE

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:24.730
THIS BILL BUT BUT THE BUT BUT

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:26.632
THE REASONS FOR BEING PRO PROPER

02:03:26.699 --> 02:03:28.501
HERE BY OPPOSITION HAVE

02:03:28.567 --> 02:03:30.302
SOMETHING O DO WITH ENTIRELY.

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:31.337
DIFFERENT PROBLEM WORSE THAT

02:03:31.403 --> 02:03:33.272
WERE SOLD WE'RE TOLD THAT WE

02:03:33.339 --> 02:03:34.440
SHOULDN'T FIX HALF THE PROBLEM

02:03:34.507 --> 02:03:35.975
UNLESS WE FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.109
AND THAT'S NOT IN THERE ARE

02:03:37.176 --> 02:03:39.145
JURISDICTIONS THERE'S FIFTY A

02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:40.379
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:43.482
GO GET HIM GO ASK THE QUESTIONS

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:43.783
[inaudible]

02:03:43.849 --> 02:03:50.589
MAR A OTHER QUESTION IS ON THE

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:52.057
CORPUS OF THE STRESS.

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:54.693
THE ONE POINT.

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.796
THREE OUT OF GIVE YOU THE THE

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:59.231
THE THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:03:59.298 --> 02:04:01.967
THAT'S PRODUCED WITH THAT -- AND

02:04:02.034 --> 02:04:03.169
I UNDERSTAND WE CAN ALWAYS COME

02:04:03.235 --> 02:04:04.937
BACK AND ADD TO THE CORPUS I I I

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:06.539
GET THAT.

02:04:06.605 --> 02:04:09.308
I DON'T SEE ANY PRIORITY THAT'S

02:04:09.375 --> 02:04:11.610
PUT HERE ON THAT HOW THAT WOULD

02:04:11.677 --> 02:04:13.746
BE [inaudible]

02:04:13.813 --> 02:04:15.648
DIVVIED UP.

02:04:15.714 --> 02:04:17.283
IS THERE ANY INTENTION HERE OR

02:04:17.349 --> 02:04:19.185
IS THIS SORT OF FIRST COME FIRST

02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:21.520
SERVE WHO'S WHO NEEDS -- NM YEAH

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:24.123
THE DATA.

02:04:24.190 --> 02:04:25.090
WE HAD.

02:04:25.157 --> 02:04:26.559
A LITTLE BIT DOWN THE LINE NICE

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:27.893
I REALIZE.

02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.862
THIS BILL PROPOSES THAT THE

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:31.197
STATE WATER BOARD WOULD HAVE A

02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:33.432
PROCESS WITH AN IMPLEMENTATION

02:04:33.499 --> 02:04:36.001
PLAN INCLUDING STAKEHOLDER INPUT

02:04:36.068 --> 02:04:37.236
INTO THAT.

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:39.772
SO IT DOESN'T SAY ABSOLUTELY

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:42.041
THIS CATEGORY HAS TO GO FIRST TO

02:04:42.107 --> 02:04:43.442
HAVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY

02:04:43.509 --> 02:04:45.678
THERE'S FLEXIBILITY ON IT.

02:04:45.744 --> 02:04:47.680
AND THE THE KEY IS THE PUBLIC

02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:49.248
PROCESS AT THE STATE WATER BOARD

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:51.851
IN THAT PLAN AND CONCEIVABLY THE

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:53.752
WATER RESOURCE BOARD WHO IS

02:04:53.819 --> 02:04:54.687
CHARGED WITH.

02:04:54.753 --> 02:04:56.422
HELPING CONSOLIDATE UNDER

02:04:56.488 --> 02:04:57.756
PERFORMING AND NON PERFORMING

02:04:57.823 --> 02:04:59.425
DISTRICTS COULD USE THIS AS A

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:01.994
CARROT FOR EITHER AN ASSOCIATION

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:03.495
OF THREE UNDER PRFORMING

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:04.997
DISTRICTS TO COME TOGETHER TO

02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:05.598
TRY.

02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:07.333
TO GET IT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:09.134
NOT THAT JOINS WITH ANOTHER

02:05:09.201 --> 02:05:10.302
PERFORMING DISTRICT THAT GETS

02:05:10.369 --> 02:05:12.171
THE O. N. M. THAT THEY NEED TO

02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:13.906
GET IT UP IS THAT YOUR THINKING

02:05:13.973 --> 02:05:14.740
MADAM.

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:16.575
AUTHOR IT IS MY THINKING AND NOT

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:18.677
ONLY THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:19.778
IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:22.281
BOND FUNDS THAT PROVIDE.

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:25.517
RESOURCES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION

02:05:25.584 --> 02:05:27.953
OR THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:30.189
THE PROJECTS AND SO THIS IS THE

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:31.557
O. N. M. IT'S GOING TO BE

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:33.926
REQUIRED TO TO GET THAT GOING BY

02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:34.960
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:36.328
CARE PRESUMABLY IF EVER.

02:05:36.395 --> 02:05:37.897
IF WE GET MANAGEMENT IN THERE

02:05:37.963 --> 02:05:39.465
THAT KNOWS HOW THIS WORKS.%

02:05:39.531 --> 02:05:42.801
UP TO SNUFF THE NECK WOULD BE

02:05:42.868 --> 02:05:43.369
IMPROVED.

02:05:43.435 --> 02:05:44.536
I HAVE STILL SOME CONCERNS HERE

02:05:44.603 --> 02:05:46.705
BUT I'M VERY.

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:48.107
I GUESS SOME OF YOUR CHARGE

02:06:02.488 --> 02:06:02.955
SOME OF THE POINTS RAISED

FOSSIL FUEL DIESEL POWERED

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:31.670
TRUCKS AND BUSES ARE SIGNIFICANT

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:32.871
SOURCE.

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:35.441
OF THAT POLLUTION.

02:08:35.507 --> 02:08:37.743
JAZZ THAT CATEGORY OF VEHICLES

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:38.877
ALONE.

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:42.014
ARE RESPONSIBLE 433%.

02:08:42.081 --> 02:08:44.383
OF THE SMOG CAUSING POLLUTION

02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:45.851
SERVE THE EMISSIONS THAT CREATE

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:47.686
THE SMOG.

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:51.390
AND 25% OF OUR TOTAL GREENHOUSE

02:08:51.457 --> 02:08:52.291
GAS EMISSIONS FROM

02:08:52.357 --> 02:08:55.194
TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS THE

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:55.694
LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:56.962
EMISSIONS.

02:08:57.029 --> 02:08:58.864
WE ALSO KNOW THAT DIESEL

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.065
PARTICULATE MATTER IS

02:09:00.132 --> 02:09:01.934
PARTICULARLY [inaudible]

TO LONGS TO CHILDREN AND THERE'S

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:08.006
A LINK.

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:10.342
BETWEEN DIESEL EXHAUST IN CANCER

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:12.311
AND HEART DISEASE.

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:14.413
INTERESTINGLY A RESEARCH REPORT

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.548
OUT OF EUROPE.

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:18.851
FOUND THAT MORE PEOPLE IN EUROPE

02:09:18.917 --> 02:09:20.819
DIE EARLY.

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:22.454
PRIME DIESEL CARS BAD AIR

02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:25.090
QUALITY THAN FROM CIGARETTES.

02:09:25.157 --> 02:09:26.391
WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT

02:09:26.458 --> 02:09:28.393
SITUATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:30.963
SO WHAT S. B. FORTY FOUR DOES IS

02:09:31.029 --> 02:09:33.799
DIRECT OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:35.234
TO HELP.

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:37.202
DEVELOP A PLAN FOR HOW ARE

02:09:37.269 --> 02:09:39.138
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE

02:09:39.204 --> 02:09:41.340
SECTOR THOSE VEHICLES THAT MOST

02:09:41.406 --> 02:09:44.243
RELY ON PETROLEUM BASED DIESEL.

02:09:44.309 --> 02:09:46.245
CAN HELP MEET OUR CLEAN AIR AND

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:48.046
ARE.

02:09:48.113 --> 02:09:50.182
CARBON REDUCTION GOALS AND NOW I

02:09:50.249 --> 02:09:52.684
WILL ALLOW MY WITNESSES AND

THAT'S BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:04.596
FIVE YEARS TO ACCELERATE THE

02:10:04.663 --> 02:10:05.797
COMMERCIALIZATION.

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:07.432
AD GROWTH OF THE CLEAN

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:07.966
TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY

02:10:08.033 --> 02:10:09.368
INDUSTRY.

02:10:09.434 --> 02:10:10.536
CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE

02:10:10.602 --> 02:10:11.870
GOALS HAVE GIVEN RISE TO A

02:10:11.937 --> 02:10:13.505
RENAISSANCE IN VEHICLE

02:10:13.572 --> 02:10:16.008
MANUFACTURING IN THIS STATE.

02:10:16.074 --> 02:10:18.277
SHOP HERE TO RESEARCH DESIGN

02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:21.446
BUILD CLEAN VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES.

02:10:21.513 --> 02:10:22.814
ACROSS ALL VEHICLE CLASSES

02:10:22.881 --> 02:10:25.184
COMPANIES LIKE FOR TERRA MOTIVE

02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:28.253
B. Y. DE TESLA CHANGE.

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.989
GREEN POWER TRANSPARENT.

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:32.558
ARE JUST A FEW THE MANUFACTURERS

02:10:32.624 --> 02:10:33.458
THAT HAVE COME HERE TO THIS

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:35.327
STATE AND ARE GROWING OUT

02:10:35.394 --> 02:10:35.827
BECAUSE OF CAP AND TRADE

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:36.828
PROGRAMS.

02:10:36.895 --> 02:10:37.896
THESE COMPANIES ARE JUST THE TIP

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:39.031
OF THE ICEBERG OF WHAT COULD BE

02:10:39.097 --> 02:10:40.766
TO COME.

02:10:40.832 --> 02:10:42.501
AS A RESULT MANY NEW VEHICLE

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:43.535
CLASSES IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:44.937
DUTY VEHICLE SPACE ARE IN THE

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:46.772
PROCESS OF BECOMING OR HAVE

02:10:46.838 --> 02:10:48.607
ALREADY BECOME COMMERCIALIZED.

02:10:48.674 --> 02:10:49.942
AS LONG AS IT STAYS STAYS THE

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:50.642
COURSE WITH THIS CLINIC IN

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:52.811
MINUTES THESE TRENDS WILL NOT

02:10:52.878 --> 02:10:54.246
ONLY CONTINUE BUT INCREASE.

02:10:54.313 --> 02:10:55.681
SB FORTY FOUR IS THE NEXT

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:57.249
LOGICAL STEP IN OUR STATE

02:10:57.316 --> 02:10:58.951
PLANNING EFFORTS TO KEEP

02:10:59.017 --> 02:11:00.552
RATIONING DOWN VEHICLE EMISSIONS

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:02.187
AND SIGNALING TO MANUFACTURERS

02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:03.655
THAT WE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:04.856
FROM OUR COMMITMENTS.

02:11:04.923 --> 02:11:06.725
PARALLEL TO THIS STATE IN THAT

02:11:06.792 --> 02:11:07.960
IT INVESTMENT INCENTIVE FUNDING

02:11:08.026 --> 02:11:08.860
FROM CAP AND TRADE IS ALSO

02:11:08.927 --> 02:11:10.062
CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING THE

02:11:10.128 --> 02:11:11.597
COMMERCIALIZATION PROCESS TO

02:11:11.663 --> 02:11:13.065
CREATE THE INDUCEMENTS NEEDED

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:14.766
FOR COMPANIES TO KEEP BUILDING A

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:16.735
PIPELINE OF ADVANCE CLEAN TRUCK.

02:11:16.802 --> 02:11:18.570
BUS AND OFFERED EQUIPMENT. TO

02:11:18.637 --> 02:11:20.138
MAKE A PROGRAM FOR BUILDING NEW

02:11:20.205 --> 02:11:21.873
IN MAY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:23.242
VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY SUCCESSFUL

02:11:23.308 --> 02:11:25.143
THERE NEEDS TO BE PROGRAM

02:11:25.210 --> 02:11:27.012
CERTAINTY SEVERAL YEARS AHEAD.

02:11:27.079 --> 02:11:27.546
THAT IS BECAUSE IT TAKES

02:11:27.613 --> 02:11:28.981
MANUFACTURES OF OF TRUCKS AND

02:11:29.047 --> 02:11:31.049
BUSES FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS TO

02:11:31.116 --> 02:11:32.718
BRING IN NEW PRODUCT TO MARKET.

02:11:32.784 --> 02:11:33.785
AND THOSE MANUFACTURERS ARE

02:11:33.852 --> 02:11:35.587
UNLIKELY TO START THE PROCESS OF

02:11:35.654 --> 02:11:37.155
BUILDING A NEW VEHICLE UNLESS

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:38.090
THEY CAN LOOK OUT AND HAVE A

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:39.558
CLEAR PICTURE OF THE DEMAND AND

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:40.993
THE PARTNERSHIPS AVAILABLE OVER

02:11:41.059 --> 02:11:42.361
THAT WHOLE TIME FRAME.

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:44.096
ALSO FLEET OPERATORS NEED TO BE

02:11:44.162 --> 02:11:45.631
ABLE TO SCHEDULE BOTH LONG THE

02:11:45.697 --> 02:11:47.866
VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:48.834
INVESTMENTS MULTIPLE YEARS IN

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:50.535
ADVANCE AND UNLESS THEY HAVE A

02:11:50.602 --> 02:11:51.803
CLEAR PICTURE OF THE RESOURCES

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:53.205
AND REQUIREMENTS AVAILABLE

02:11:53.272 --> 02:11:54.473
MULTIPLE YEARS OUT.

02:11:54.539 --> 02:11:55.674
THEY'LL HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:57.542
INVESTMENTS BEYOND ISOLATED

02:11:57.609 --> 02:11:58.644
EXPERIMENTS.

02:11:58.710 --> 02:12:00.279
BUSINESSES ARE MAKING INVESTMENT

02:12:00.345 --> 02:12:02.047
DECISIONS ON A LONG TERM BASIS

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:02.814
AND THE STATE NEEDS TO MORE

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:04.383
CLOSELY SEE SYNCHRONIZE ITS

THESE INVESTMENT CYCLES.

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:08.620
AND DOING SO WOULD HELP TO BRING

02:12:08.687 --> 02:12:10.355
THE MARKET. TO MORE OF THESE

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:11.890
VEHICLES THE MARKET FASTER AND

02:12:11.957 --> 02:12:12.791
CONTINUE TO DRAW MORE

02:12:12.858 --> 02:12:14.192
MANUFACTURERS IN INVESTMENTS TO

02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:15.927

02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:12.644
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

02:19:12.711 --> 02:19:13.178
BILL.

02:19:13.244 --> 02:19:14.913
OUR MEMBERS AND CALIFORNIA'S

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:16.848
FARMERS AND RANCHERS DEPEND ON

02:19:16.915 --> 02:19:18.450
MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF DIESEL

02:19:18.516 --> 02:19:20.618
VEHICLES TO PLANT AND HARVEST

02:19:20.685 --> 02:19:21.786
AND BRING THEIR CROPS AND

02:19:21.853 --> 02:19:23.288
LIVESTOCK TO MARKET.

02:19:23.354 --> 02:19:25.757
AND WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE

02:19:25.824 --> 02:19:27.859
USE OF INCENTIVES THE CHALLENGE

02:19:27.926 --> 02:19:30.495
IS ONCE A REGULATION IS ADOPTED

02:19:30.562 --> 02:19:32.030
THOSE ASCENT INCENTIVES ARE NO

02:19:32.097 --> 02:19:33.898
LONGER AVAILABLE TO HELP

02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:35.700
TRANSITION INTO NEWER CLEANER

02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:36.501
TECHNOLOGY.

02:19:36.568 --> 02:19:37.736
I AM WE APPRECIATE WE'VE BEEN

02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:39.370
WORKING WITH THE OTHERS OFFICE --

WE APPRECIATE -- CONTINUING THAT

02:19:42.474 --> 02:19:43.842
CONVERSATION AS THE BILL MOVES

02:19:43.908 --> 02:19:45.310
FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:19:45.376 --> 02:19:47.011
AGRICULTURE ISN'T -- FURTHER

02:19:47.078 --> 02:19:49.047
DISADVANTAGE AND THAT WE STILL

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:50.415
HAVE ACCESS TO THE VEHICLES THAT

02:19:50.482 --> 02:19:51.649
WE NEED THANK YOU.

02:19:51.716 --> 02:19:54.152
THANK YOU THEN MR BETWEEN HER

02:19:54.219 --> 02:19:55.520
BACK.

02:19:55.587 --> 02:19:56.121
YES THANK YOU AGAIN TOM FORKS

02:19:56.187 --> 02:19:57.689
DIESEL TECHNOLOGY FORUM AGAIN WE

02:19:57.756 --> 02:19:59.657
REPRESENT MAKERS OF DIESEL

02:19:59.724 --> 02:20:01.726
ENGINES TRUCKS LIGHT DUTY

02:20:01.793 --> 02:20:03.161
VEHICLES COMPONENTS.

02:20:03.228 --> 02:20:05.730
IN LOW CARBON FUELS -- LIKE THE

02:20:05.797 --> 02:20:07.065
PREVIOUS SPEAKER WE DON'T HAVE A

02:20:07.132 --> 02:20:08.466
POSITION YEA OR NAY ON THE BILL

02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:09.868
IN FACT SOME OF THE THINGS THE

02:20:09.934 --> 02:20:11.569
BILLS TRYING TO DO -- MANY OF

02:20:11.636 --> 02:20:13.037
OUR MEMBERS SUPPORT MANY OF OUR

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:14.172
MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY MEMBERS OF

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:15.640
CAL START AS WELL THEY'RE

02:20:15.707 --> 02:20:17.709
SETTING UP SHOP THEY'RE WORKING

02:20:17.776 --> 02:20:18.910
ON ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY VEHICLES.

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:20.211
IN MANY OF OUR MEMBERS IN FACT

02:20:20.278 --> 02:20:21.813
HE DIESEL TECHNOLOGY FORM ALONG

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:23.948
WITH A LOT OF OTHER MEMBERS OF A

02:20:24.015 --> 02:20:25.650
COALITION WHO ARE PARTICIPATING

02:20:25.717 --> 02:20:27.118
IN THE CLEAN AIR DIALOGUE PART

02:20:27.185 --> 02:20:30.588
OF SEEDS ON GOING -- DISCUSSIONS

02:20:30.655 --> 02:20:32.290
ABOUT TECHNOLOGY HAVE ISSUED A

02:20:32.357 --> 02:20:33.725
WHITE PAPER ABOUT LONG TERM

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:36.127
FUNDING FROM THE FOR LOW CARBON

02:20:36.194 --> 02:20:37.595
TRANSPORTATION INTERPHALANGEAL

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:40.465
PORT OF OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS --

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:41.900
NOW WITH REGARD TO THE FINDINGS

02:20:41.966 --> 02:20:44.135
OF THE BILL WE DO WANT TO LET

02:20:44.202 --> 02:20:45.570
THE RECORD SHOW THAT.

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:48.139
IT THE THE FINDINGS WE FIND ALL

02:20:48.206 --> 02:20:50.408
MET A LOT OF THE PROGRESS THAT

02:20:50.475 --> 02:20:51.643
HAS BEEN MADE BY DIESEL ENGINES

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:53.011
IN BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:54.345
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS.

02:20:54.412 --> 02:20:56.514
THE CHAMBER HAS GONE DOWN A LOT

02:20:56.581 --> 02:20:57.916
OF THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO REPEAT

02:20:57.982 --> 02:21:00.585
THOSE THINGS I DID WANT TO JUST

02:21:00.652 --> 02:21:02.053
BRING BRING YOU TO THIS POINT.

02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:03.588
OLDER DIESEL ENGINES ARE THE

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:05.323
PROBLEM AND EVERYBODY'S WORKING

02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:06.624
TO GET OLDER DIESEL ENGINES OFF

02:21:06.691 --> 02:21:07.592
THE ROAD.

02:21:07.659 --> 02:21:09.160
THE LAST TEN YEARS EVERY NEW

02:21:09.227 --> 02:21:10.962
DIESEL TRUCKS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:13.198
ACHIEVE THAT 98% KNOCKS

02:21:13.264 --> 02:21:14.699
REDUCTION IN PM REDUCTION.

02:21:14.766 --> 02:21:15.466
I ALSO WANT TO BRING TO YOUR

02:21:15.533 --> 02:21:16.835
ATTENTION THAT IT WOULD TAKE

02:21:16.901 --> 02:21:18.837
MORE THAN SIXTY OLDER DIESEL

02:21:18.903 --> 02:21:20.605
TRUCKS TO PRODUCE THE SAME

02:21:20.672 --> 02:21:22.907
AMOUNT OF KNOX AND PM THAT ONE

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:24.309
NEW DIESEL TRUCK MAKES.

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:25.810
AND THEN LASTLY FROM THE HEALTH

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:27.445
EFFECTS INSTITUTE I DID WANT TO

02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:28.479
MENTION THAT.

02:21:28.546 --> 02:21:29.814
GIVEN PROPER AFTER TREATMENT

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:31.549
SYSTEMS THE HEALTH EFFECTS

02:21:31.616 --> 02:21:33.852
INSTITUTE WITH THIS ASUS STUDY

02:21:33.918 --> 02:21:35.186
FOUND THAT.

02:21:35.253 --> 02:21:36.888
PM FILTERS AND ESSIE OUR SYSTEMS

02:21:36.955 --> 02:21:38.656
GREATLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PM

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:40.158
FOR MODERN DIESEL ENGINES AND

02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:41.759
THAT THE OVERALL TOXICITY OF

02:21:41.826 --> 02:21:42.927
EXHAUST FROM MODERN DIESEL

02:21:42.994 --> 02:21:44.362
ENGINES IS SIGNIFICANTLY

02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:45.363
DECREASED.

02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:47.031
COMPARED WITH THE TOXICITY OF

02:21:47.098 --> 02:21:48.700
EMISSIONS FROM TRADITIONAL

02:21:48.766 --> 02:21:50.168
TECHNOLOGY DIESEL ENGINES THESE

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:51.736
ARE THE OLDER DIESEL ENGINES WE

02:21:51.803 --> 02:21:53.137
ALL AGREE LET'S GET RID OF THEM.

02:21:53.204 --> 02:21:55.006
AND THEN FINALLY WITH REGARD TO

02:21:55.073 --> 02:21:56.875
THE ROLE THAT LOW CARBON DIESEL

02:21:56.941 --> 02:21:58.776
FUEL PLAYS WERE IT NOT FOR LOW

02:21:58.843 --> 02:22:00.578
CARBON DIESEL FUELS THE SUCCESS

02:22:00.645 --> 02:22:01.913
OF THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.948
WOULD NOT BE WHAT IT IS TODAY.

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:05.717
ON THE GASOLINE SIDE YOUR CAPPED

02:22:05.783 --> 02:22:07.185
AT 10% PLANS BECAUSE OF THE

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:08.987
ETHANOL CONSTRAINTS WITH WITH

02:22:09.053 --> 02:22:10.822
GASOLINE ENGINES SO ALL THE

02:22:10.889 --> 02:22:12.090
GAMES FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS

02:22:12.156 --> 02:22:13.224
HAVE BEEN MADE WITH CARBON

02:22:13.291 --> 02:22:14.225
REDUCTION CREDITING CREDIT

02:22:14.292 --> 02:22:14.726
TRADING.

02:22:14.792 --> 02:22:16.828
AS CALM AS A RESULT OF LOW

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:20.632
CARBON DIESEL ESPECIALLY.

02:22:20.698 --> 02:22:21.866
RE REALLY LOW CARBON RENEWABLE

02:22:21.933 --> 02:22:22.467
DIESEL SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE

02:22:22.533 --> 02:22:23.134
SURE THAT THE OPTICS OF THE BILL

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:24.836
DO NOT.

02:22:24.903 --> 02:22:27.739
OVERLOOK THE GREAT PROGRESS IN

02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:29.407
STRIDES THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

02:22:29.474 --> 02:22:30.108
MADE.

02:22:30.174 --> 02:22:31.576
IT'S A IT'S A LEGACY INDUSTRY

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:33.378
IT'S A HUNDRED YEARS OLD THE OF

02:22:33.444 --> 02:22:34.279
MANY OF OUR MAKERS ARE STILL THE

02:22:34.345 --> 02:22:36.681
ONES PRODUCING ELECTRIC VEHICLES

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:38.316
ELECTRIC CLASSY TRACTORS IN

02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:39.584
MEDIUM DUTIES AS WELL.

02:22:39.651 --> 02:22:41.519
SO AGAIN JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:22:41.586 --> 02:22:43.388
FROM A TECHNOLOGY STANDPOINT WE

02:22:43.454 --> 02:22:45.556
GET THE WHOLE PICTURE NOT JUST

02:22:45.623 --> 02:22:49.827
THE BAD STUFF THANK YOU.

02:22:49.894 --> 02:22:50.395
BY MATT RIEMANN WITHOUT MY

02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:51.996
TRUCKING ASSOCIATION ALSO IN A

02:22:52.063 --> 02:22:53.798
TWEENER NEUTRAL POSITION --

02:22:53.865 --> 02:22:54.933
WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR

02:22:54.999 --> 02:22:57.268
AND THE STAKE HOLDERS FOR SOME

PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS ON THE

02:22:57.969 --> 02:22:58.903
BILL.

02:22:58.970 --> 02:23:01.306
AS CALIFORNIA MOVES TOWARDS NEAR

02:23:01.372 --> 02:23:02.874
ZERO AND ZERO TECHNOLOGY WE ARE

02:23:02.941 --> 02:23:03.741
GONNA NEED A MULTI YEAR

02:23:03.808 --> 02:23:05.443
COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE IN

02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:06.878
ORDER TO HELP OUR FLEETS.

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:09.881
BE ABLE TO PLAN YEARS OUT -- WE

02:23:09.948 --> 02:23:13.484
LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THIS

02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:15.019
CONVERSATION MOVED FORWARD.

02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:16.788
I NEITHER A TWEENER NORA --

02:23:16.854 --> 02:23:18.489
OPPOSITION I APOLOGIZED TO ME

ARTHUR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.809
TAKING OUT THE 10% GREENHOUSE

02:23:37.875 --> 02:23:40.211
GAS EMISSIONS REQUIREMENT LOOK

02:23:40.278 --> 02:23:41.579
FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE

02:23:41.646 --> 02:23:44.248
GREENHOUSE GAS BUDGET AND STUFF --

02:23:44.315 --> 02:23:46.918
TOO MY QUESTION IS ON THE REPORT

02:23:46.985 --> 02:23:48.619
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE WE

02:23:48.686 --> 02:23:50.221
GOT A REPORT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:51.456
IT SORT OF UPDATE THESE MOBILE

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:52.590
SOURCES.

02:23:52.657 --> 02:23:54.158
THEY IDENTIFY THINGS THEY TALKED

02:23:54.225 --> 02:23:55.626
ABOUT TRUCKS THERE'S A REPAIR

02:23:55.693 --> 02:23:59.697
BOARD HAS A STRATEGY ON TRUCKS --

02:23:59.764 --> 02:24:01.366
WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE WERE YOU

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:03.001
LOOKING FOR TO WITH THIS

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:05.336
LEGISLATION ON AD?

02:24:05.403 --> 02:24:07.005
OTHER THAN THE REPORT COMING OUT

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:10.241
IN JANUARY.

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:10.942
ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHAT A

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:13.211
TREAT YOUR MANSER THANK YOU SIR.

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:15.313
S. B. FORTY FOUR YOU'VE HEARD

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:18.282
SOME FOLKS -- IN OPPOSITION

02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:19.517
REFERRED OPTICS.

02:24:19.584 --> 02:24:21.319
MY PURPOSE IS SUBSTANTIVE IS NOT

02:24:21.386 --> 02:24:24.222
JUST OPTICS -- FI OFFENDED SOME

02:24:24.288 --> 02:24:25.757
WITH THE OPTICS APOLOGIES BUT

02:24:25.823 --> 02:24:28.026
YES CALIFORNIA IS DOING A LOT

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:29.394
WITH LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:30.828
AND OTHERS.

02:24:30.895 --> 02:24:32.163
TO HELP.

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:35.466
CLEAN UP THE THAT SECTOR BUT IF

02:24:35.533 --> 02:24:37.101
WE LOOK AT THE SECTOR OF MEDIUM

02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:40.004
AND HEAVY DUTY AND IF WE LOOK AT

02:24:40.071 --> 02:24:41.372
OUR INVESTMENTS.

02:24:41.439 --> 02:24:42.673
FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:44.208
EMISSIONS REDUCTION FUND FOR

02:24:44.275 --> 02:24:46.010
EXAMPLE.

02:24:46.077 --> 02:24:48.780
IT IS FAR MORE HEAVILY WEIGHTED

02:24:48.846 --> 02:24:50.415
TOWARDS PASSENGER VEHICLES.

02:24:50.481 --> 02:24:51.115
NOW.

02:24:51.182 --> 02:24:53.017
I DON'T WANT TO REDUCE OUR

02:24:53.084 --> 02:24:54.986
INVESTMENT IN PASSENGER VEHICLES

02:24:55.053 --> 02:24:56.687
THEY ARE STILL THERE'S MORE

02:24:56.754 --> 02:24:58.589
PASSENGER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD

02:24:58.656 --> 02:25:00.758
THEY ARE VERY POLLUTING.

02:25:00.825 --> 02:25:02.126
BUT IF I LOOK AT THE MEDIUM AND

02:25:02.193 --> 02:25:04.328
HEAVY DUTY SECTOR.

02:25:04.395 --> 02:25:05.363
THEY ARE.

02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:07.965
THE OWNERS OF THOSE VEHICLES NOT

02:25:08.032 --> 02:25:10.201
IN ALL CASES BUT IN MANY CASES

02:25:10.268 --> 02:25:14.038
BECAUSE THERE -- THEY TAKE A LOT

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:17.308
OF WHAT'S THE WORD THE ET THERE

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:19.410
ARE IT'S HARD ON THOSE VEHICLES

02:25:19.477 --> 02:25:20.778
TO DO LONG HAUL AND ALL.

02:25:20.845 --> 02:25:22.313
THE OWNERSHIP CHANGES MORE

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:24.282
FREQUENTLY.

02:25:24.348 --> 02:25:25.850
AND SO BY PUTTING MORE

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:28.019
INVESTMENT TOWARDS OUR HEAVY AND

02:25:28.086 --> 02:25:29.220
MEDIUM DUTY.

02:25:29.287 --> 02:25:30.688
WE MAY.

02:27:00.311 --> 02:27:02.813
GARCIA AT AB SIX SEVENTEEN HAS A

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:04.849

DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON A

02:27:12.356 --> 02:27:14.759
CONTINUOUS BASIS BE THAT AS IT

02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:18.162
IS THAT'S A THAT'S ANOTHER

02:27:18.229 --> 02:27:19.230
STRATEGY.

AS I AM AS I'M READING THIS YOUR

02:27:21.599 --> 02:27:23.901
ASKING THE AIRPORT TO TELL COME

UP WITH A STRATEGY NOT THAT

02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:26.871
CHOOSE THIS STRATEGY -- THAT

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:28.472
STRATEGY THE BOTH STRATEGIES

02:27:28.539 --> 02:27:30.641

BUT WE STILL HAVE.

02:27:38.115 --> 02:27:40.751
THE DIRTIEST AIR OF ANYWHERE IN

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:40.985
THE US.

02:27:41.052 --> 02:27:43.888
AND OUR SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING

02:27:43.955 --> 02:27:46.424
US OUR WINDOW TO ADDRESS THE

02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:48.759
CLIMATE CRISIS IS VERY NARROW.

02:27:48.826 --> 02:27:52.396
IF YOU'RE THE OPERATOR OF A OF

02:27:52.463 --> 02:27:54.398

02:28:05.276 --> 02:28:07.378
MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO BE IN A ZERO

02:28:07.445 --> 02:28:08.212
EMISSION.

02:28:08.279 --> 02:28:10.181

02:39:23.553 --> 02:39:24.688
SO CLOSE THE BROWN EYES THAT

02:39:24.755 --> 02:39:27.524
THAT -- THAT'S GOING TO CLOSE AS

02:39:27.591 --> 02:39:29.893
A SIXTY ZERO VOTE -- SINISTER

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:31.395
AND STILL CONTEMPLATING.

02:39:31.461 --> 02:39:34.164
AND JUST DELIVERING IT'S GOOD

02:39:34.231 --> 02:39:35.065
IT'S GOOD DELIBERATIONS A GOOD

02:39:35.132 --> 02:39:35.799
THING.

02:39:35.866 --> 02:39:38.068
AND WITH THAT I I THINK OUR

02:39:38.135 --> 02:39:39.703
BUSINESS HERE TODAY IS.

02:39:42.539 --> 02:39:44.141
THESE COMPLICATED BILLS.

02:39:44.207 --> 02:39:44.808
STILL A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE

02:39:44.875 --> 02:39:47.644
ON ALL OF THEM -- BUT WITH THAT

02:39:47.711 --> 02:39:48.979
