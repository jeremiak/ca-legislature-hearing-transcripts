A LOT OF ORDER US A MATTER OF FEATURES PROVOCATIVE SO THAT WOULD BE THE THIRD BILL AND WE HEAR INSTEAD OF THE TENTH BILL EVERYTHING LIKE THAT EVERYTHING AFTER THAT WILL. FOLLOW IN THE ORDER OF THE AGENDA LET ME JUST INDICATE THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THE AGENDA IN TERMS OF THE WAR MEASURES HEARD IN FILE ORDER HAS BEEN MODIFIED- MORE RECENTLY BUT THOSE OF THE AGENDA ORDER ON THE DISTRIBUTED AGENDA IS CORRECT- IN THE BILL'S IS LISTED ARE CORRECT THOSE ARE HERE IN THE BUILDING.

AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WITH ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY WHICH WILL ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND PROMOTE THE INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND BY PARK MONEY MANAGERS. IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS TO PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE UTILIZATION OF EMERGING AND DIVERSE MONEY MANAGERS. CALPERS AND CAL STIRS HAVE A COMBINED ASSET OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION BUT A RELATIVELY LOW RATE OF PARTICIPATION OF EMERGING AND DIVERSE MANAGER IS WHEN IT'S COMPARED. TO THE OTHER PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEMS IN OTHER STATES IN THE WORLD THE BUSINESS FEW THINGS ARE MORE DETERMINATIVE OF THE ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THE AVAILABILITY OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL. IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BUSINESS THAT GROWS TO BECOME THE NEXT TESLA FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE MY BUSINESS IS THAT START SMALL AND STAY SMALL BECAUSE THEY LACK ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THEY NEED IN ORDER TO GROW AND THRIVE TODAY ONLY 1% OF VENTURE CAPITAL BACKED OFFENDERS ARE BLOCKED IN LESS THAN 2% ARE A LOT AND. NEXT DISSENT IN A COUNTRY THREE WERE WOMEN MAKE UP ON THE- OF OUR POPULATION WOMEN RECEIVE A DISMAL TWO POINT 7% OF VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING. AND DESPITE BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE COUNTRY WOMEN OF COLOR RECEIVE LESS THAN 1% OF VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING. HOW CAN I LOOK MY DAUGHTER OR MY SONS- IN THE EYE AND TELL THEM THEY CAN START AND BE THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN COMPANY WHEN INVESTORS EXCLUDE THEM FROM ACCESSING THOSE VERY FUNDS. IT IS CLEAR THAT SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES EXIST AND HOW THE SYSTEM SELECT MANAGERS TO INVEST THE CAPITAL THAT THEY OVERSEE. AND AS THE SAYING GOES IF YOU CAN'T MEASURE IT YOU CAN'T MANAGEMENT AB EIGHT NINETY. IS STRICTLY OBTAINING THE DATA WE NEED TO MEASURE HOW THESE FUNDS APPROACH DIVERSE CITY. CALIFORNIA CANNOT HAVE SHARED SUCCESS WITHOUT SHARED OPPORTUNITY. IN ORDER TO HELP ADDRESS THESE INEQUITIES WE MUST ENSURE THAT WOMEN IN BY PARK INDIVIDUALS HAVE MORE EQUAL ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AND THAT'S PART OF THE ON GOING PROJECT THE LEGISLATURE WILL NEED ACCURATE INFORMATION ON HOW CALPERS AND CAL STIRS DISPERSE OUR CAPITAL TO WOMEN IN BY PARK MANAGERS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SPOT AND IS A SPONSOR OF THE BILL SELANDER BROKE. WITH THAT NEW AMERICAN ALLIANCE AND JIM PARK CEO OF THE ASSOCIATION. OF ASIAN AMERICAN INVESTMENT MANAGERS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- WE WILL CALL FIRST ONES BROOKS THE FIRST LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS. WHO IS CALLING ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE SO IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE YOU MAY PROCEED. MY NAME IS SOLANGE FERNANDEZ BROOKS I'M THE CEO OF THE NEW AMERICA ALLIANCE.

OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL TO WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED FIRMS AND TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY LEADERSHIP AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP CORPORATE AMERICA AND PUBLIC SERVICE. AS WAS MENTIONED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES. THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL MEANS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY CAN THRIVE AND BUILD SUCCESS AMONG ITS MEMBERS AND ONE THAT- THAT STAGNATE AND- WHENEVER HIGHER LEVELS OF POVERTY AND LACK OF OPPORTUNITY IN A BELIEVES THAT THIS BILL AB EIGHT NINETY EIGHT AND AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL REINSTATE. AND TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BY HAVING CALPERS AND CAL STIRS REPORT ON HOW THEY DEPLOY THEIR INVESTMENT THAT IT. CHARGES ICICLE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS COMBINED. CURRENCY YOUR FIRST STEP PRIOR TO WIN A TEN OF MY FIFTEEN YEARS AS A PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITHIN CHARACTERS INVESTMENT BRANCH I SPENT REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE CIO THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER TO HELP CREATE LEAD AND MANAGE THE FUND'S INVESTMENTS WITH WOMEN AND MINORITY MANAGERS. THE LAST FIVE YEARS I MANAGE A GLOBAL CRITICAL. WOMEN WORKING IN THIS COUNTRY PLAN TO GOOD INTELLIGENT PEOPLE AND THEY DO THE WORK TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY. HOWEVER THEY WORK IN A CULTURE WHERE THE LARGE INVESTMENT FIRMS ARE FAVORED IN IN INVESTMENT A LARGE INVESTMENT FIRMS ARE TRADITIONALLY MALE AND THEY'RE QUITE SH. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A COULD DO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE ALL OPPORTUNITIES ARE BETTER TO ENABLE DIGITAL ACTION OF THE BEST INVESTMENT FIRM. FOR THE STRATEGY AND GENERATE THE BEST RETURNS FOR THE PENSIONERS. WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE ALMOST 70% OF THE POPULATION AND ACCORDING TO A TWENTY NINETEEN NINETY CONDITION STUDY. ONLY MANAGE ONE POINT 3% OF THE SIXTY NINE TRILLION ACTIVE MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY. THAT IS THAT. SHINGLE. THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF ASKING CHARACTERS ARE CALPERS TO ENTRUST THEIR **** LOCAL FORMING MANAGERS MEETINGS ABOUT ASKING THEM TO IDENTIFY HELP PUBLIC FUNDS ARE MANAGED AND INVESTED WITH A HIGH PERFORMING WOMEN AND MINORITY MANAGERS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. ULTIMATELY MOVING THE NEEDLE ON THIS ISSUE REQUIRES ACTIVE LEGISLATIVE ENGAGEMENT. THIS WILL TIS BILL WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE DATA THAT YOU NEED TO ACCURATELY ASSESS HOW THE FUNDS ARE PERFORMING ON DIVERSITY- BUT CRUCIAL FIRST STEP. THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN FREESHEET TO- TRYING TO KEEP TO THE TWO MINUTES JIM PARK IS THE NEXT.

EIGHT NINETY MY NAME IS JIM PARKER CEO OF ASSOCIATION OF ASIAN AMERICAN INVESTMENT MANAGERS PAYING. THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL REINSTATE AND ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY IN HOW CALPERS AND CAL STIRS THE BOARD THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTMENT CAPITAL. NOT A NEWER FOR THE STATE PENSION PROGRAM BUT LARGELY A REINSTATEMENT OF SOMETHING THAT WAS IN PLACE PREVIOUSLY. INTERNATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX DEDICATED TO PROMOTING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OF ASIAN AMERICANS PACIFIC ISLANDERS IN THE FIELD INVESTMENT MANAGER. AS WELL AS SUPPORTING DIVERSITY IN THE INDUSTRY OVERALL LAST YEAR IN RELEASED A STUDY WHICH FOUND THAT FOUND THAT U. S. APPREHENSION FARMS WITH MAJORITY ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER OWNERSHIP MANAGED JUST POINT 7% OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. DESPITE THEIR PERFORMANCE OF MEETING OR EXCEEDING INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS THE PERFORMANCE RESULTS. SUPPORT THE EARLIER STUDY BY THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION BUT SALONS MENTIONED TRUMP A DRAMATIC UNDER REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN AND OTHER MINORITY OWNED FIRMS ANDINVESTMENT BEALL DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE BONDS. DID NOT SEE ANY DROP IN PERFORMANCE TOO OFTEN DISCUSSION AROUND BROADENING OPPORTUNITIES TO MORE MINORITY. AND WOMEN OWNED FIRMS DEVOLVE INTO BASELESS ASSERTIONS ABOUT MOORING RETURNS WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT THE CASE. BUT LACK OF ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS UNDER OUR COLLECTIVE ABILITY AS A SOCIETY TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT CAPITAL FOR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT BLACK MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED INVESTMENT FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT. OTHER MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED LOCAL BUSINESSES CALIFORNIA CANNOT BENEFIT FROM THE FULL POWER OF DIVERSITY. UNLESS WE PROVIDE SURE OPPORTUNITY AND THIS CAN BE DONE WITHOUT SACRIFICING RETURNS FOR THE TWO PENSION PROGRAMS AB EIGHT NINE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN PROVIDING POLICYMAKERS WITH THE DATA THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE ALLOCATION DECISIONS ARE.

DURING CODE NINETEEN ANY OF THE MANUFACTURER SUFFERED LOSSES HAD TO DIVERSIFY AND SOME MOVED OUT OF THE STATE OR CLOSE COMPLETELY THIS AFFECTED THE SMALLER BUSINESSES THE MOST. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THESE AND OTHER CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANIES TO OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES BECAUSE THIS NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR WORK FORCE AND SOME OF THE MOST UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS FEEL THIS IMPACT THE MOST- THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR US TO ESTABLISH THIS PILOT PROJECT.

CENTERS RUSSELL- WISHING TO BE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF I COULD ASK A QUESTION EITHER OF THE AUTHOR OR OF- MR MILBURN YOUR EXPERT WITNESS WILL LEAVE IT TO THE AUTHORS OF PROVOCATIVE- BECAUSE MIGHT MIGHT APPROVED BY SUPPORT- I THINK REACHING OUT TO PARTICULAR BUSINESS SECTORS- AND TO GET A BETTER IDEA FROM THEM AS TO WHAT. THEY NEED. YOU KNOW FROM OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I DIDN'T QUITE GET THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EXAMPLE THAT MR MILBURN- GAVE IN TERMS OF. CERTAIN SECTORS- THAT WERE HURT- IN THE- DURING THE PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY. AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAD ON SMALL BUSINESSES I DIDN'T QUITE GET THE CONNECTION BETWEEN. WHAT KIND OF TRAINING JUST AS AN EXAMPLE WHAT KIND OF TRAINING. WOULD BE NEEDED FOR THE SMALL EMPLOYERS. OUR TO GET BACK ON TRACK AS FAR AS AS A BUSINESS- AND ALL AND THE REASON I SAY I ASK THIS QUESTION IS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN MANY MANY PROGRAMS. WHERE THE TRAINING IS DONE BUT THERE'S NO FINAL CONNECTION TO A GOOD JOB. AND SO IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE TO YOU KNOW GET THE EXCITEMENT AND THEY'RE SO MOTIVATED AND THEY GO THROUGH THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS. BUT REALLY THERE'S NO FINAL CONNECTION TO A JOB THEY GET SOME- GETS THEM TO WORK SO THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING WITH IT- AND BUT MISTER BROOKE MILBORNE GAVE AN EXAMPLE MY BODY FOR YOU OR HE COULD. JUST COMMENT ON THAT ONE CERTAINLY I WILL GIVE MR MILBURN AND OPPORTUNITY TO COMMONSENSE HE DID GIVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY OUR GOAL IS TO GET THESE FOLKS BACK TO WORK THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED AND SO. AGAIN YOU KNOW HAPPY TO REVIEW EVALUATE LOOKING AT PERHAPS FUTURE MA'AM AND SHOULD THAT BE NEED NEED TO BE CLARIFIED A MADE UP BUT LET ME GO AHEAD AND TURN IT OVER TO MR MODI MOD BORNE OUT IF HE'S STILL AVAILABLE TO. COMMENT YES YES I'M HERE. AND IN DIVERSE DATA QUESTION THANK YOU- THE HEIGHT OF THE RECORDS I WAS MAKING IS THAT THESE- SMALLER BUSINESSES ARE CONNECTED. TO EACH OTHER AND TO OTHER BUSINESSES. A LARGER BUSINESS AS A AND- AS YOU KNOW THE IMPACT- AFFECT SOME OF THE LARGER BUSINESSES. THE SMALLER BUSINESSES IT TRICKLES DOWN TO THEM NOW. YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY I THINK THAT- WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS THAT DO LEAD IN A- CAREER PATH% ORIENTED JOB PLACEMENT. AND TRAINING AND UPSKILLING THAT LEADS TO INCREASED WAGES AND PROMOTIONS ON THE JOB AND SO THE- YEAH I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM- IF YOU'D LIKE ONE- BUT BUT THAT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT. OF THE TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE RUN- AND THAT ARE- STATEWIDE NETWORK RUNS- MUST RESULT IN- YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF CAREER ORIENTED JOB PLACEMENT THAT PAYS WELL AND HAS FUTURE UPWARD MOBILITY. AND HE'LL UPSKILLING WITHIN THE JOBS THAT RESULTS IN- INDIVIDUALS NOT ONLY KEEPING THEIR JOB AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE UP AND EARN HIGHER WAGES- TO THAT KIND OF ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. THIRD ROW ZERO FOUR WELL- YES I MEAN IN A BROAD SENSE SO I LOOK FORWARD- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THE RESULTS ARE OF THIS- PILOT PROGRAM AND HOW.

EXPERIENCE WITH OUR OWN OWN FIRST HAND WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS SEEKING HELP- COMMITTEE. AB FOUR FOUR TWO ESTABLISHES THE OFFICE OF CLIMATE ADVOCACY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS RIGHTS TO SEEK BENEFITS ADMINISTERED BY EDIE.

THIS ADVISORY GROUP IS CHARGED WITH CREATING THE CLIMATE BILL OF RIGHTS AND WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE- OCA TO ENSURE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE BEARS CLAIMANTS FACE WHILE SEEKING ACCESS TO THEIR BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH ETV HAS MADE NOTABLE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OPERATIONS BOTH THE OCA AND THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE CLAIMANTS VOICES AND EXPERIENCES ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF FUTURE POLICY AND SYSTEMATIC CHANGES. MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD IS CRITICAL FOR ENSURING CLAIMANTS CAN ACCESS THEIR BENEFITS WHEN THEY NEED THE MOST THE BILL HAS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. UTILITY WORKERS UNION OF AMERICA AND MANY OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS I KNOW ALL OF YOU ON THE DICE TODAY AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE DEALT WITH VERY FRUSTRATED UNDERSTANDABLY FRUSTRATED CONSTITUENTS WHO WERE TRYING TO ACCESS THEIR EDT BENEFITS.

AS FAR AS A FOCUS ON THOSE SERVICES LIKE EDIE D. LIKE LEAVES- LIKE DISABILITY THOSE ARE REALLY SPECIFIC. BENEFITS THAT I THINK ARE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM.

IS- AS WE GET THE HOUSE IN ORDER HERE WE WILL WELCOME UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ WHO'S HERE TO PRESENT. ON TWO BILLS IN CONSECUTIVE ORDER CHEN THE FIRST. EIGHTY SEVEN OH ONE. BOTH OF THEM. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING ALL THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE WITH US ON THIS LANGUAGE WHICH RESPONSE TO SEVERAL THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS TO MAKE TO MAKE IT NEXT DAY DELIVERY POSSIBLE CORPORATIONS LIKE AMAZON HAVE FORCED WAREHOUSE WORKERS TO MOVE FASTER SERVICE MORE CUSTOMERS WITH MORE ORDERS IN RECORD AMOUNT OF TIME AND RISK THEIR OWN BODIES IN THE PROCESS. THESE COMPANIES HAVE CREATED ENVIRONMENT WHERE WORKERS ARE TREATED LIKE MACHINES EVERY DAY THEY FACE CRUSHING WORK SPEEDS TO MEET RELENTLESS PRODUCTIVITY QUOTAS THEIR TIME MOVEMENTS AND HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN PACKAGE UP TO FOUR HUNDRED ITEMS IN AN HOUR OFTEN REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OR WEIGHT OF THE ITEM IS STRICTLY MONITORED MINUTES BETWEEN SCANNING PACKAGES WHERE THEY ALL GO OVER THEM DETECT THE WORKERS OFF TASK CAN RESULT IN AUTOMATIC DISCIPLINE AND EVEN TERMINATION. CORPORATIONS LIKE AMAZON OR SETTING THE INDUSTRY STANDARD. WHAT'S CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE AND WHEN THE MOST PHYSICALLY DANGEROUS FIELDS WORK AND THE NUMBERS DON'T LOOK GOOD. AMAZON WORKERS ARE INJURED ON THE JOB AT. AT TWICE THE AVERAGE RATE OF THE OVERALL WHERE HOUSING INDUSTRY AND THREE TIMES THE AVERAGE RATE. ACROSS ALL PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IN TWENTY TWENTY AMAZON SERIOUS INJURY RATE WAS 80% HIGHER THAN THE RATE FOR ALL OTHER WAREHOUSING EMPLOYERS. ALMOST HAD TO MISS WORK AND EXPERIENCE LONGER RECOVERY PERIODS THAN OTHER WAREHOUSE WORKERS. THESE DANGEROUS PRACTICES ARE CAUSING AMAZON TO CHURN THROUGH WORKERS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE AND IT'S SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE. THE ANNUAL TURNOVER RATE FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WITH AMAZON DISTRIBUTION CENTERS HAS SHOT UP TO OVER A 100% A YEAR A HUNDRED PERCENT. TURNOVER IN AN INDUSTRY A YEAR. WORKERS HAVE REPEATEDLY GOT INJURED ON THE JOB BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED TO RUSH THROUGH SAFETY PROTOCOLS TO TRY AND MEET GREAT. YET MOST. STILL CANNOT SPEAK OUT FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPECIFY IN LAW THAT WORKERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THE BATHROOM INSTEAD OF URINATING IN. WHEREVER THEY CAN'T OR WHEN THEY CAN THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND SANITIZER EQUIPMENT DURING A PANDEMIC. WE CAN'T STAND BY AND ACCEPT THAT THESE UNDIGNIFIED AN UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS ARE THE NEW FUTURE WORK IT'S CLEAR THAT A CHANGE IN LAW IS LONG OVERDUE. AB SEVEN NO ONE WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WORKERS COULD NOT BE DISCIPLINED FOR FAILING TO MEET A QUOTA THAT DIDN'T ALLOW THEM. TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS IN THE LABOR CODE. THAT COMPLIANCE TIME COULD NOT BE COUNTED AGAINST THEM IS BEING OFF TASK. IF A WORKER FACES DISCIPLINE WITHIN NINETY DAYS AFTER THEY FILED A COMPLAINT. ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO A QUOTA. IN AB SEVEN OH ONE WOULD CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THE ADVERSE ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMPANY WAS RETALIATORY. AB SEVEN A ONE BUT ALSO ALLOWS STATE AGENCIES TO INSPECT WAREHOUSE QUOTA RECORDS WHEN THEY RECEIVE WORKER COMPLAINTS. INTERNET CAL OSHA TO CRAFT WAREHOUSE SAFETY STANDARDS TO MINIMIZE WORKER INJURIES IN WAREHOUSES THE USE PRODUCTION QUOTAS. THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO LARGE WAREHOUSES WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES STATEWIDE OR HUNDRED IN A SINGLE LOCATION. WE WORK HARD TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS. INCLUDING DEFINING HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS. SPECIFYING THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S ROLE IN ENFORCEMENT. COULD FIND THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CURE ANY ALLEGED VIOLATIONS UNDER PAGA. AND WE PREVIOUSLY REMOVED NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS FOR EMPLOYERS TO UPDATE EMPLOYEES ON THE QUOTE IS EVERY TIME THEY CHANGE. SHOULD THE COMMITTEE PASSES BILL WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK. WITH THE OPPOSITION IN DISCUSSIONS TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO TO ALLEVIATE THEIR CONCERNS. IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN. IT IS CLEAR THAT NOBODY WOULD SUGGEST THAT AMAZON WORKERS IN PARTICULAR BUT WORKERS IN LARGE WAREHOUSES THAT USE ALDER THEM'S. ARE GETTING HURT AT DISPROPORTIONATE RATES. WHAT'S NOT CLEAR IS WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO DO ABOUT IT. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM WITH THE OPPOSITION- THAN THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. THEY THINK- THE LAW SHOULD TAKE IT. TAKE IT IS TAKING CARE OF IT DESPITE THESE ASTONISHING NUMBERS. I HAVE A WITNESS TESTIMONY ON THE- ON THE PHONES ROSE MERRY MOLINA THE ORGANIZING DIRECTOR FOR THE LA FEDERATION OF LABOR. AND SAYS R. CASPER. THE UPS A UPS WAREHOUSE WORKER. THANK YOU SOME FOR. ROSE MARIE MOLINA IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE YOU MAY PROCEED TO TESTIFY AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M ON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY MILLION ORGANIZING DIRECTOR FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR. WE WORK WITH THOUSANDS OF WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN LA. WHERE HOUSING HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WITH THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES CRIPPLING IN OUR REGION. MORE COMPANIES ARE COMPETING TO MEET ONE DAY AND TWO HOUR DELIVERY BUT THERE'S A HUMAN COST THIS CONVENIENCE. I'VE SPOKEN TO WORKERS IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH TWO OF TORN LIGAMENTS HAVE BOXES ON THEIR HEADS AND WALK UP TO TWENTY MILES A DAY TO MEET THE FAST PACE OF THE WORK. pINJURIES THAT LEAD THEM OUT OF THE WORKFORCE FOR MONTHS AT A TIME. WORKERS ARE REPEATING TO IT IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE RATE. WE NEED EIGHTY SEVEN I WONDER TRANSPARENCY IN FOR PROTECTION. I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION. BIRTH ABILITY TO BROADEN GEGEN REFERENCE TO HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS- ARE RESPONSIVE ADDED WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT I'M NOT BETTER FOR HELPING US TO TIGHTEN UP IN LIMITS HOW WE DEFINE THOSE TERMS FOR THE ARE NARROWLY TAILORED. TO OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH REQUIREMENTS. THE LABOR CODE. HELLO SHOULD STANDARD. SECOND THAT THIS BILL. WILL IN. CATION ARE IS CAN. IT'S THE KEYBOARD STATE. EXISTING ONE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY FOR. WORKERS LIKE ALL. INJURIES DUE TO THE PACE OF WORK REQUIREMENTS. AGENCIES HAVE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT WORKERS EVEN IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY BECAUSE ILLNESS AND DEATH FOR WORKING PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN CALIFORNIA. NEVERTHELESS WE AMENDED THE BILL TO CLARIFY THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE VIOLATIONS. OUR GOAL IS NOT TO PENALIZE EMPLOYERS. IS TO PROTECT WORKERS AND PREVENT INJURIES. WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS BILL IS WORKABLE AFFAIRE. WE HAVE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS SOME QUITE OPPOSITION AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADDRESS ADDITIONAL ISSUE. BUT WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT SETTLE FOR A BILL THAT FAILED TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM PREVENTABLE INJURIES. I WANT SETTLE FOR A BILL THAT LEAVES WORKERS WITH NO RECOURSE WHEN STATE AGENCIES FAILED TO ACT. NORMALLY SETTLE FOR A BILL. THAT ALLOWS WHERE HEALTH COMPANY TO CONTINUE TO TREAT WORKERS AS DISPOSABLE. AMAZON IS NOW THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER IN CALIFORNIA AND IS SETTING STANDARDS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. WAREHOUSES HERE HAVE THREE TIMES THE INJURY RATE AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. WASHINGTON STATE OSHA HAS FOUND DIRECT TIES BETWEEN AMAZON PIECE OF WORK REQUIREMENTS AND THEIR INJURY RATE.

THANK YOU ORDERED APPRECIATE WORKING THROUGH THAT- IN AGAIN AS A REMINDER WILL COME BACK TO ANYONE THAT DROPPED OFF OR WAS IT CALLED UPON PRIOR BILLS WHEN WE GET A CHANCE TO DO SO IF THEY CAN BE PATIENT. ON THIS BILL AB SEVEN A ONE IS OR- ANYTHING- THAT MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS AT THIS TIME. CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU MISTERTO FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND THE MODERATOR FOR COMMITTING ITSELF BACK ON TRACK- THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ NICE TO SEE YOU I'M BY BECOME KIND OF A CONSPIRACY WERE OF- CAMINO SHE'S ALWAYS IMPRESSED WHEN YOU BRING A BILL. THAT COMES WITH THE LONGEST LIST OF SUPPORTERS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN. ALSO TYPICALLY WITH THE LONGEST LIST OF OPPOSITION- SO I GUESS WE'RE DOING SOMETHING IMPORTANT HERE I DO HAVE A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS. BUT ON THE AMENDMENT AMENDMENT NINE IT REFERS TO- PERSONAL WORK SPEED DATA- AND I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THE SHOWS IS SET UP I MEAN IS IT A TERM OF ART WILL EVERYBODY. INVOLVED IS THERE AN ACCEPTED DEFINITION TO THAT IF SOMEBODY REQUEST THEIR- PERSONAL WORK SPEED DATA PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH ONE- WOULD ALL EMPLOYERS INCLUDING AMAZON KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS AN ACCEPTED DEFINITION FOR THAT I WOULD EXPECT THAT WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY- BEEN ASSET BECAUSE THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAVE THAT DATA. KNOW WHAT IT IS AND THAT WOULD BE AMAZON COMPANIES THAT DON'T USE QUOTAS AND PERSONAL WORK SPEED DATA- GET WE'VE WE'VE HAD QUESTIONS FROM WHAT SOMEWHERE HOUSES THAT ARE LIKE. WE DON'T KNOW THEY GET THE JOB DONE YET THAT'S NOT WHAT WITH THAT'S NOT WHO WERE. PERTAIN THIS BILL TO SO THOSE WHO HAVE IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT APPRECIATE BUT I EAN SO. HOW DO WE MAKE THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE WHO DO AND THOSE WHO DON'T IF. YOU DON'T HAVE A QUOTA YOU'RE NOT TRACKING BY ALDER THEM THE WORK SPEED OF OUR OR THE OR THE WORK SPEED HOW MUCH YOU'RE DOING THEN IT DOESN'T APPLY THE BILL. IN ESSENCE DOESN'T TO THERE'S A REASON WE CLEAR DIVISION HAS TO RELATE TO ALGORITHMIC TRACKING OF PRODUCTIVITY. AT FISHER THAT TO ON ON THE NINETY DAYS IS BETTER. MR MOULTRIE MENTIONED HIS B. IS THERE ANY THOUGHT GIVEN TO DEMEAN I DON'T TAKE SERIOUSLY HIS. CONCERNED LIKE YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS. AT LEAST THEORETICALLY SUBJECT TO GAMING LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON. PREVENTING AN EMPLOYEEFROM USING THAT REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AS A WAY OF. STAVING OFF. MANAGEMENT WE ARE WORKING THROUGH AND I ANTICIPATE WILL TAKE- ANOTHER SET OF AMENDMENTS COMING OUT WE'RE WORKING PACKED WITH THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS IF THEY SHOULD MOVE THE NEXT COMMITTEE. TO TALK ABOUT LIMITING THAT TO A ONE TIME- USE FOR THE PERSONAL DATA- THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF PERSONAL DATA SAID THAT IT WOULDN'T BE GAME MOBILE FEEL WELL. THAT AND THEN ON TO MY LEAST FAVORITE- TOPICS PAGA- IT AGAIN THERE THERE'S A CONCERN HERE THAT THAT INTRODUCING THE POCKET ON HERE. MIGHT MIGHT SERVE MATURE EXPAND CARGO ACROSS A BUNCH OF SPHERES WHICH WHICH MY SPEAKING TO THAT. WELL WE DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S TRUE AND THERE'S NOTHING TO SUGGEST THERE'S NO CASE LAW TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S TRUE WE ARE LOOKING DEEPER INTO THAT IF NECESSARY WE CAN- FURTHER CLARIFY THE POT. THAT PORTION OF THIS BILL. ONLY IS. IN THE BILL WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SURE- THAT. COULD USE FOR COUNTY- COUNTY NECESSARILY LIKE THAT HAVE THEIR OWN. RULES AND REGULATIONS- AS FAR AS THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP ABOUT PROJECT. I FEEL LIKE IT'S A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS TO BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE CHAMBER. THEY LIKE TO CALL THEM EVERYTHING IN THIS BILL ABSURD BUT IT'S ABSURD TO SUGGEST THAT WERE WERE SAYING THE RIGHT TO CURE ON PAGA IS ONLY. THE ELEMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT ONE ON YOU NOT LOOKING AT TWENTY SIX NINE NINE POINT THREE AS A WHOLE. SO WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE AND CONTINUE TO CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE. WE PUT THE SPECIFICALLY PUT IN THAT THIS IS SUBJECT TO WRITE HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE NOT EXPANDING PADA AS FAR AS A RESULTING IN- I NECESSARY IF YOU WELL LITIGATION THAT. FOR LITIGATION SAKE WE WANT PEOPLE TO. BE ABLE TO GET THEIR JOB BACK IF THEY'VE BEEN FIRED TO BE ABLE TO- CHANGE THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY ARE GETTING INJURED- WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO. JUST PAY PEOPLE COMPENSATION THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO THAT. SHOULD THAT BE WHAT ONE OF THE POINTS I MAKE IS WITH RESPECT TO PAGA. AND APPLYING CARGO TO- THE FORTUNE OF REGULATIONS IN WHICH CLEARLY HAS SOME LARGE IMPLICATIONS SO AGAIN THEY'VE SHOWN US NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT PIECE WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY. CONTACTED OUTSIDE ATTORNEYS YOU KNOW THAT IT WASN'T FLAGGED AS SOMETHING FROM FROM- ARE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THAT. WE THINK IT'S A RED HERRING BUT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T DO THAT INTO. MOVING KIND OF IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. WITH RESPECT TO CALLOW SHUCKS- THEY MADE THE POINT THAT DID MANAGE THESE ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY. THROUGH AN BY CAL OSHA SO WHY DO THIS pLEGISLATIVELY AS OPPOSED TO FOR US IN SENDING A LETTER. TO CAL OSHA URGING AND MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES WERE ACTUALLY TELLING THAT'S WHAT LEGISLATIVE WE'RE DOING WHERE WHERE. WHERE FORCING HELLO SHOULD TO DO THIS WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED WITH THERE ARE REFERENCING IS EXISTING REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS IN CAL OSHA BUT THOSE STANDARDS ARE ACTUALLY- NOT SUFFICIENT AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY SO. WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT REPETITIVE- THE REPORT OF INJURY STANDARD TO CAL OSHA HAS BASICALLY THAT SAYS A COMPANY HAS TO HAVE. YOU KNOW A POLICY AND PROCEDURE AND THAT THEY HAVE TO. TALK TO THEIR EMPLOYEES ABOUT IT WELL THAT'S HAPPENING AND YET STILL WE'RE SEEING THIS DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF INJURIES AND IT'S NOT JUST REPETITIVE USE INJURIES IT'S A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT ARE MAKING THIS WORKSPACE. AND SAFE SO TO SUGGEST THAT STANDARDS THAT EXIST CURRENTLY AND THAT WE ASSUME OF COURSE AMAZON AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS A PRIME BY. WHICH AREN'T STANDARD TELL YOU AND I WOULD THINK OF STANDARDS IT'S NOT SAYING YOU CAN'T DO THIS FOR YOU YOU THIS IS THIS IS TOO FAST THIS IS GOING TO MUCH. THIS IS EXPECTING TOO MUCH OF A RATE OF SPEED. OR EXPECTING PEOPLE TO CARRY TOO MUCH OF. A CERTAIN WEIGHT REQUIREMENT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE RATE OF PACE THAT THEY'RE GOING- WHAT IT SAYS IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A POLICY. YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR EMPLOYER THAT POLICY PROVIDED TRAINING AND TELL THEM TO TELL YOU IF THEY GET HURT THAT'S THE REGULATION RIGHT NOW THAT IS INSUFFICIENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THIS BILL. THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON IN AMAZON WAREHOUSES JAY AND WHY WE'RE ASKING CAL OSHA. TO PROVIDE- GUIDELINES THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE. JERRY I IDEA TO DO APPRECIATE THAT SO. A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION FACT MOST OF TODAY REVOLVES AROUND AMAZON I ASSUME. BY EXTENSION YOU KNOW BUSINESSES THAT WOULD THAT WOULD. SERVE BASE THEIR- MODELS ON AMAZON'S BUT BUT HOW HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO. CUT THE BROADER CONCERN AMONG SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT. AT THESE NEW STANDARDS. AND BUT- THE. THEIR APPLICATION WILL WILL THEN ONE TO BE APPLIED TO BUSINESSES. BASE MODELS ARE VERY. THAN A- AND FOR. THIS IS. PLUGGABLE IF YOU'RE NOT FORESEEN A QUOTA OR WORK PACE FROM YOUR EMPLOYEES THEN IT'S NOT YOU'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS BILL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS PUTTING OUT BY CAL OSHA. SO I'M SORRY SIR WHAT WOULD YOU SAY QUOTIT SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO WORK PACE AS OPPOSED TO FRANCIS FROM PACKING OR SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE MATERIAL UOTA LIKE X. NUMBER OF BOXES. A QUOTA THAT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR WORKERS TO- THERE BY UTILIZED OTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS USE THE RESTROOM WASH THEIR HANDS PROVIDED A SAFE WORK SPACE THAT. ACTUALLY EVEN COMPLAIN ABOUT A WORKING CONDITION IT'S TAKEN OFF OF YOUR TIME ON TASK YOUR YOUR PRODUCTIVITY SO IF YOU'RE NOT USING THIS TYPE OF- ALL THE RHYTHM IN STANDARD. THEN THE BILL ITSELF DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU HOWEVER THE REASON WE CAN'T SAY OBVIOUSLY WE WOULDN'T JUST SAY IT ONLY APPLIES TO AMAZON BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT LARGER WAREHOUSES ARE STARTING TO USE THE SAME MODEL. THAT AMAZON IS USING AND WE FEAR THAT GIVEN THAT THEY'RE SETTING THE STANDARD ON NEXT DAY DELIVERY ON HOW FAST PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK- ON WHAT'S EXPECTED THAT MORE AND MORE WAREHOUSES WILL USE THIS. AND SO- IT DOES CURRENTLY JUST APPLIES TO THOSE WHO HAVE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND WAREHOUSE A THOUSAND STATEWIDE- THAT'S A LARGER. WAREHOUSE PRODUCTION- IT'S NOT YOU KNOW MOM AND POP. BUT WE ALSO IT ALSO ONLY APPLIES IF YOU'RE USING THIS WORK PAY STANDARD. IN THE INSURANCE YOU KNOW SO READ THROUGH ALL THE HOUSES IN THE BILL BUT HOW EXPLICIT. FOR SPECIFIC IS AROUND THE YOU KNOW THIS THE DEFINITION OF AN ALGORITHMIC STANDARD STANDARD APPROACHING OUR PARTY IF YOU CAN'T USE A WORK PACE YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T IN ITS BASE IN SOME WAYS THE CHAMBERS RIGHT RIGHT THIS IS THE LAW YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO PENALIZE PEOPLE FOR USING THE RESTROOM. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT AMAZON CURRENTLY IS JUDGING A PERFORMANCE STANDARD AND BECAUSE THERE'S NO IT'S NOT A HUMAN INTERACTION RIGHT IT'S A- YOU CAN'T TELL YOU CAN'T TELL THE COMPUTER. HOLD ON I I'VE GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM. THAT'S NOT SUFFOCATING ME TO USE THE RESTROOM TODAY- IT'S AN AUTOMATIC AT ISSUE AND IN THERE BEING SPENT UP AUTOMATICALLY THERE'S NO- PROCESS BY WHICH THIS WOULD AFFECT IT. SO IN THAT SENSE WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THOSE WHO AREN'T USING THIS WE HAVE WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH- SMALL WAREHOUSES THAT ARE SAID SO YOU KNOW. HOW DOES THIS APPLY TO US WHAT DOESN'T- WE'D BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THAT BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD THAT AS A FEAR FROM THOSE WHO DON'T USE. THIS TYPE OF- PACE SETTING STANDARD. DID YOU YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. THE PROVISIONS THIS BILL MAKE MAKE CLEAR THERE'S A VERY CLEAR DELINEATION BETWEEN. IS THIS IS FROM THIS DOES APPLY BUSINESS FOR THE PROMISE I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE'VE HAD DECADES OF WAREHOUSES. WE PROBABLY SENTRIES WAREHOUSES- OBVIOUSLY WENT WHEN WAREHOUSES FIRST CAME OUT WE MIGHT HAVE SOME RULES BUT WE'VE HAD DECADES WITHOUT THE TYPE OF INJURIES THAT WERE SEEN NOW. AT AMAZON BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY'RE REQUIRING A WORK SPEED. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS. IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF WORKS BE THAT SO FAST IT DOESN'T EVEN ALLOW YOU TO- BASICALLY BE A HUMAN BEING. AND SO AS YOU KNOW THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT PACE AND QUOTA REQUIREMENT I DON'T SEE HOW. THESE ISSUES- WHAT A RISE IN THE SAME WAY. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO SAY I WORK AT A WAREHOUSE THERE IS NO QUOTA BUT- I'M PENALIZED FOR GOING TO BATH AND THAT WAS ALREADY ILLEGAL I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW. THAT THAT'S NOT THE SOLUTION AND EVEN SO THEN. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GO THE BATHROOM WAS A LOT BEFORE. BUT AND IT MAKES SENSE I DON'T KNOW I GUESS I GUESS BUT YOU KNOW LIKE I'VE HAD LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS WITH- IF THE OPPOSITION IN THE IN THE MADE A VERY CLEAR ASSERTION THAT NOBODY'S BEING PREVENTED. FROM GOING TO THE BATHROOM TAKING BREAKS TO EITHER YOUR SORT OF COUNTERING I THINK IT'S CLEAR THERE'S A LAWSUIT IN FACT THAT WAS. FILED IN ONE BY- EMPLOYEES OUT OF RIVERSIDE- AMAZON FACILITY- THE JUDGE FOUND THAT WAS AND REASONABLE THE BATHROOM WITH SEVEN MINUTE WALK FROM WHERE THEY WORK AND OF COURSE EVEN THAT MEANS THAT EVEN DURING. A REST PERIOD A FIFTEEN MINUTE REST PERIOD. YOUR WALK TO THE BATHROOM AND BACK TAKES UP FORTY MINUTES OF A FIFTEEN MINUTE BREAK WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM WASHED HER HANDS WITHIN A ONE MINUTE PERIOD OF TIME. TO NOT BE ON TASK WHEN YOU RETURN AND THEY'D BE. ACTUALLY FOUND YOU KNOW GUILTY OF THAT SO WE KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING AND WE AND WE CONTINUE TO HEAR IT'S HAPPENING FROM THE WORKERS THEMSELVES. THAT AT. ANY TIME OFF TASK GETS RECORDED BY ALL THE RHYTHM. AND YOU KNOW THEY CAN BE- PENALIZED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS FOR BEING OFF TASK WITHOUT ANYONE. EVEN CHECKING IN OF WHY. OKAY THANK YOU- QUESTION. WOMAN PRITCHARD. SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A CHEN. SUBJECT THAT I APPRECIATE MR THANK YOU FOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER NEWMAN THE- OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR ALSO AND THEN WILL COME. TO OUR BY SURE SIR ROSA THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL I MEAN THE WAY OUR WAREHOUSES ARE BEING RUN TODAY IS WITH THESE ALGORITHMS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY WAREHOUSES HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST. IT IS JUST SEEMS LIKE ANOTHER TACTIC TO SPEED UP WORK WE FIND THAT WHEREVER WE FIND THAT IT'S DONE AS- A BUSINESS MODEL. TO SPEED UP WORK THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE- THE SAFETY OF THE WORKERS AT RISK THAT IS AN ISSUE YOU KNOW DOING WORK IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IT'S THE SAME THING IS WHAT IS A TACTIC TO SPEED UP WORK TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THE WORK AND STILL BE SAFE AND SECURE AND I THINK I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WITNESS SAW WORKS AT- YOU PS WHO SAID YEAH I HAVE TO WORK HARD. YEAH I HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH A CERTAIN PACE BUT I'M SAY I'M SAFE. YOU KNOW I'M SAFE AND HOW I DO IT NOW I COULD RAISE THE ISSUE AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT'S- VERY DISTURBING ABOUT THE AMAZON MODEL- AND HOW. THAT'S USE THAT MODEL IS USED FOR THIS OWNER THIS FOUNDER. TO BE THE RICHEST PERSON ON EARTH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS A EXTREMELY- BOTHERSOME. AND AND TRAGIC ABOUT THE WORKERS WHO WERE- GETTING HURT SO BADLY WELL SOMEONE IS BECOMING THE RICHEST PERSON ON THE ON THE PLANET SO I AM I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE RAISING THIS AND- CAL OSHA IS NOT KEEPING UP WITH ALL THE CHANGES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IT'S NOT KEEPING UP WITH HOW THE USE OF ALGORITHMS. IS AFFECTING THAT ARE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE WORKERS AND WE GOT A PUSH UP AND THIS IS A GOOD PUSH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. SOON GROWS TO A MINIATURE. OF THE FOUR THANK YOU- OUR SISTER SHARE MINE IS MORE JUST OF A COMMENT AND THIS IS COMING FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE. IN MY OPINION IT WOULD BEHOOVE ANY EMPLOYER. TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ITS EMPLOYEES ARE ONE SAFE AND- AND NOT JUST MAKE IT SO THAT THEY WANT TO COME TO WORK AND ENJOY THEIR WORK AND BE PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT- WHEN YOU PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS OPTIMAL THEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO THEIR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO THE BEST JOB. AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT ALSO INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO DO YOU WANT TO DO HIRE THE BEST PEOPLE POSSIBLE SO IT IS A LITTLE- IT'S CONCERNING TO ME THAT. IT AND I KNOW RIGHT NOW EVERYONE'S REFERENCING AMAZON BUT I'M THINKING IN GENERAL'S EMPLOYERS THAT YOU'D WANT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD BE OPTIMAL FOR ONE NUMBER TWO. TO CREATE AN AND SAVE BUSINESS PRACTICE MODEL I THINK WOULD BE. AN ABSOLUTE DISSERVICE TO ANY EMPLOYER BECAUSE- YOUR YOUR WORKERS COMP LIABILITY GOES UP. WHEN YOU DON'T PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENT SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IN MY MIND AS TO ONE. WHAT WOULD NOT WHAT WOULD NOT HELLO NOT THAT WAY. WHY WOULD AN EMPLOYER NOT PROVIDE OR OR MODIFIED TO MODEL SO THAT IT DOESN'T CREATE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARD NUMBER TWO- TAKING CONSIDERATION THE SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT. YOU DON'T WANT THE COST OF DOING AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALSO THINKING OF THE TURN OVER. BECAUSE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT. IS OPTIMAL THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HIGH TURNOVER SO NOT ONLY IS YOUR WORKERS COMP GOING TO GO UP YOUR TURN OVER FOR TRAINING AND SO FORTH. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT WOULD NOT Y. THESE EMPLOYERS WOULD NOT WANT TO DO THAT ALREADY WHY IS THIS NECESSARY AND NOT IN THE BUSINESS PARTNER SPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE AT THAT CALIBER- THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST ALREADY DO THAT. WHAT THAT I THINK THAT IS A FANTASTIC QUESTION- AND I UNFORTUNATELY IT COMES DOWN TO DOLLARS AND CENTS SO- JUST LIKE KEVIN ALDER THEM TO DECIDE HOW MUCH PEOPLE SHOULD WORK IN ALL GRADE THEM TO DECIDE WHAT'S IN THEIR BEST BUSINESS PRACTICE. HOW CAN THEY MAKE THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WHAT THEY DECIDED IT IS AN- YOU DON'T. IT'S NOT I'M NOT GIVING YOU. M. YOU KNOW I COULD TALK TO WORKERS AND I HEAR WORKERS FEEL THIS WAY AN INDIVIDUAL KIND OF STORIES I CAN TELL YOU THE FACTS. IN COUNTIES THAT HAD NOTE AMAZON DISTRIBUTION CENTER PREVIOUSLY. THE TURNOVER RATE FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS WAS ABOUT COUNTIES COUNTIES IN FACT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. THAT THEN HAD AMAZON DISTRIBUTION CENTERS- DEVELOP IN THEIR COUNTY. THE TURNOVER RATE OVERALL FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS JUMPED OVER A HUNDRED AND 50% A YEAR. THAT TELLS YOU THAT THEY ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT TURNING THROUGH EMPLOYEES. THEY'VE DECIDED THAT PAINT A CERTAIN WAGE TO GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR AND UTILIZING THEM IT'S IN THEIR BEST BUSINESS PRACTICE. NOW THEIR THEIR WORKERS COMP RATES LIKEWISE HAVE TO BE. TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. BUT ANY COMPANY THAT HAS- I GUESS THE ABILITY TO MONETIZE HUMAN WORK IN THAT WAY TO MONETIZE PEOPLE'S INJURIES IN THE STATE IS IT WORTH IT TO BURN THRILLED. AND INJURE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN WHAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO DOMINATE THIS FIELD WE'RE GOING TO GET EVERYTHING OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE'RE GOING TO SET A STANDARD WE'RE GOING TO MAKE. A TON OF MONEY THAT'S WHAT AMAZON HAS DONE. WE KNOW THAT WE CAN ALL LOOK AT THESE ARE ALL. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA I'M NOT. GIVING YOU SOME YOU KNOW SECRET THIS IS PROBABLY ABOUT AVAILABLE IT'S THE SAME WAY. AND I WILL SAY WE THOUGHT WITH UNIONIZING EFFORTS RIGHT SAME WAY THEY BREAK LABOR LAWS IN FIRE UNION ORGANIZERS BECAUSE IT RATHER PAY THAT COST THAN WHAT IT WOULD COST THEM TO HAVE A UNION IN THEIR WORKPLACE. IT'S ALL RATIONAL IF ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOUR BOTTOM LINE IN YOUR BUSINESS MAKING MONEY. THAT'S OFTEN NOT WHAT WE'RE SEEING A MOM AND POP WAREHOUSES AND THAT'S WHY. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE ARE TREATED RIGHT THERE IF YOU HAVE. THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER IN THE UNITED STATES YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH MY MAKING FOR MIGHT. SHAREHOLDERS AND MY C. E. L. THE WHAT WE KNOW THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY ON AMAZON. SO AM. I KNOW THAT ALL OF US WITH WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT BOB. MAKES SENSE FOR THE BOTTOM LINE. AB THEIR WORKERS THAT EVERY REPORT CAME OUT EVEN WHEN I HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH AMAZON THEY DON'T DENY THAT THEIR WORK FORCE IS GETTING HURT AT HIGHER RATES THAN OTHER WAREHOUSES IN. IN A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT DOESN'T ONLY AFFECT THEM BECAUSE THE WAY WORKERS COMP IS DONE. THESE OTHER WAREHOUSES ARE PAYING MORE WORKERS COMP CLAIMS NOW BECAUSE AMAZON'S- IT THAT THEIR INDUSTRY STANDARD IS SO WIDE AND THEY HAVE SO MUCH OF THE MARKET SHARE THAT THEY'RE AFFECTING. ALL WORKERS COMP RATES SO IF YOU'RE NOT. OPERATING THIS WAY YOU'RE GETTING HURT BY THEIR PRACTICES AS WELL. BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE BENEFIT OF JUST TURNING THREE WORKERS. THANK YOU. OR SHOULD I SAY THERE'S ALWAYS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD IT'LL TAKE A FIFTEEN DOLLAR WAGED ON. MANY YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY NOT KNOWING THE CONSEQUENCES. FOUR I APPRECIATE THE CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT IT'LL DO TO YOUR BODY. AS MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE I ACTUALLY ALSO SPOKE WITH THE OPPOSITION AND- I WAS. IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE- I JUST PERSONALLY I'M ALWAYS NERVOUS ABOUT THE STATE COMING IN AND PUTTING ONE STANDARD ONE SIZE FITS ALL ON EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY- BECAUSE THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT THEY'RE THEY'RE- THEY'RE DIFFERENT. AND SO MODELS ARE DIFFERENT AND INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT AND I JUST I'M I'M NERVOUS ABOUT. ANYTHING THAT JUST SAYS OKAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO STANDARD WIRELESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN SPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYMENT AND DIFFERENT DEALS A MODEL SO. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BILL AS IT IS BUT- I HEAR YOU ON ON ON YOUR CONCERNS. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M NERVOUS AS WELL IF I HAD MY WAY I WOULD NEVER WANT THE STATE TO COME IN AND HAVE BROAD REGULATIONS THAT THIS IT JUST LIKE WE HEARD FROM THAT WORKER AT THE UPS- DISTRIBUTION CENTER THAT IS WHAT WE WILL THAT IS THE- THAT THE BEST OUTCOME WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL WORKER IN A WORKPLACE HAS A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND HAS A WAY TO DISCUSS. A SAFETY CONCERN WITH THEIR MANAGER WITHOUT BEING- WITH WITHOUT BEING RETALIATED AGAINST AND HAVING THAT THAT'S A FREE MARKET APPROACH TO HAVING SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE IS ACTUALLY TO HAVE A UNION BUT WE KNOW AMAZON WON'T ALLOW. THEIR THEIR WAREHOUSES BE UNIONIZED EITHER THAT WAS ANOTHER THING I OPPOSED TO THE COMPANY THEMSELVES WHAT IS THE ANSWER IF NOT THIS BECAUSE I AGREE I'D RATHER. US NOT HAVE TO- GET INTO. WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE STANDARD THE WORKER KNOWS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE MANAGER ABOUT IT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOMETHING THAT IS UNSAFE AND REFUSED TO DO IT THAT'S WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. AMAZON WON'T LET IT HAPPEN THERE SO THEN WERE FORCED TO DO THINGS THAT ARE ONE SIZE FITS ALL OUR FEEL MORE LIKE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED. TO THOSE WAREHOUSES THAT USE QUOTAS THAT USE PERSONAL DATA ONON THE EMPLOYEE AND EFFECTS THEIR THEIR US. WHETHER THE FIRED WHETHER THEY'RE THEY HAVE NOT RETALIATED AGAINST AND THAT- ARE JUST LARGE WAREHOUSES SO IT'S NEARLY TAILORED AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT I I'M WITH YOU ON THAT. I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO IT. THE CONSUMERS WHO CENTER NEWURGH HI I JUST WANT TO. JUMP BACK INTO IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAN SELECT. EVERY SINGLE THING HE SAID- BUT I ALSO WANT TO ADD. TO ALL OF YOUR POINTS THAT IS WHY WE NEED A AND AN AGGRESSIVE ENGAGE CAL OSHA- AND IF IT'S NECESSARY TO DO. THAT TO LEGISLATION WHAT WHAT WE WE'RE NOT DOING THROUGH YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS- ENFORCEMENT AND DAN AND REGULATIONS. IT THAT'S A SAD COMMENTARY- AND SO I WOULD SAY AMONG OTHER THINGS TO DO YOU KNOW WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO FORCE. THE ISSUE WITH CAL OSHA MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THESE WORKING CONDITIONS AND STANDARDS ARE SPECIFIC TO A PARTICULAR. KIND OF BUSINESS- AND- UNITARITY POINT HERE THAT THE HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE TO RESORT TO VERY BROAD LEGISLATION TO DO THAT SAID. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. DO HERE IS DIRECT HELLO SHOULD TO DO THAT IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO ANSWER YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION SO IT PULLED UP THE BILL JUST TO MAKE SURE. THAT I WASN'T IMAGINING. THE DEFINITIONS FOR EMPLOYEE WORKS BE DATA WHICH ASKED ABOUT. IS INFORMATION EMPLOYER COLLECTS STORES ANALYZE OR INTERPRETS RELATING TO AN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE'S PERFORMANCE OF THE QUOTA. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DO QUANTITIES OF TAX REFORM QUANTITIES OF ITEMS OR MATERIALS HANDLED. OUR PRODUCE RATES OF SPEED. MEASUREMENTS ARE METRICS OF EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP TO A QUOTA. AND TIME CATEGORIZED AS PERFORMING TASKS OR NOT PERFORMING TASKS AND THEN. AGAIN THE QUOTA. IS A WORK STANDARD AND WHICH AN EMPLOYEE IS ASSIGNED OR REQUIRED TO PERFORM AT A SPECIFIED PRODUCTIVITY SPEED. R PERFORM A QUANTIFIED NUMBER OF TASK OR TO HANDLE OR PRODUCE A QUALIFIED. AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WITHIN A DEFINED TIME PERIOD AND UNDER WHICH THE EMPLOYEE MAY SUFFER AN ADVERSE. EMPLOYMENT ACTION IF THEY FAIL TO COMPLETE THE PERFORMANCE STANDARD. THIS DOESN'T SAY YOU CAN'T HAVE A QUOTA THIS DOESN'T SAY- THAT. WAREHOUSES DON'T OPERATE WITH BECAUSE IT SAYS YOU HAVE TO STILL WITHIN THE QUOTA. BE ABLE TO FUNCTION- UNDER OUR STATE HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND AS A HUMAN. BEING- IT WITH NATURAL HUMAN BEING FUNCTIONS- WITHOUT BEING READ. AGAINST NOT BRIDGE AT ALL THAT CERTAIN A ONE ONE THE ISSUES HERE IS THAT M. TO THEIR- HAS HAS AN- NEW WAYS TO RUN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THE BUSINESS INCLUDING. QUANTIFYING PERFORMANCE ACROSS A RANGE OF MEASURES IN A WAREHOUSE IN EVER THOUGHT ABOUT DOING- AND IT'S APPROPRIATE CAL OSHA- SHOULD KEEP UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS LOCATED- ANYTHING ELSE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE. THE- BEFORE WE GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE ALL THE AT SOMEONE WILL FEEL SIMPLY HAD A SERIES OF THOSE- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT- LET ME JUST SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU CITED- WITH COMMITTEE STAFF- HE AND IN GETTING TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE NOW- I KNOW THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT. I THINK THAT WE'RE- YOU ARE MOVING INTO. A PERIOD AND WE'VE SEEN SIGNS OF IT OVER THE LAST COUPLE LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS- EVEN FROM AFAR BECAUSE I'VE- BEEN HERE JUST A MATTER OF MONTHS BUT WE- AS CALIFORNIANS WHO'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION WE'VE SEEN. THE LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT LAWS NEED TO BE ADJUSTED TO KEEP UP WITH A DIFFERENT TIME. A DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY ALL THE MORE REASON I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH COMMITTEE ON ON AMENDMENTS AND SO FORTH. YOU SAID AS A- AS THE AUTHOR. WAREHOUSES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR CENTURIES- CODES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR CENTURIES MIGHT MIGHT WELL GRANDFATHER CAME AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD IMMIGRANT KIND OF LISTEN. WAS PUT ON A QUOTA. HAMMERING THE CLEATS INSIDE CANNERY BOXES WITH THE PEACE IN THE CORNER THAT'S THE HARDEST PIECE TO. TO GET A HAMMER AND INPUT MALES TO YOU KNOW AND OF COURSE AS A HARD WORKING PERSON ACCEPTED THAT CHALLENGE. IN AND DID IT- I WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK AND SEE THE DATA- YOU KNOW ON ON ON THE DAY HE WALKED OUT OF THERE. AS TO WHAT HE WAS DOING THE PRIOR NINETY DAYS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN. PUT INTO THIS BILL I DON'T THINK THAT'S- AN OVER REACH I THINK THAT'S- IT IS A SIGN OF THE TIMES IT IS SOMETIMES WE EVEN HALF OF THAT DATA THAT PEOPLE CAN. TRACK THAT DATA NOW I'M NOT SURE THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT A HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS AGO. WITH ANY KIND OF. EFFICIENCIES AND I'S AVAILABLE NOW- SO YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA SEE MORE OF THIS BUT I ALSO THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WEEK WE'D- WE PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO BE. AT ODDS WITH THE VERY INDUSTRIES SAID OUR POINT PEOPLE- IN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME OF IT THIS WAY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET. UNIONIZED A 100% OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THESE KIND OF WORK PLACES AND I DON'T THINK I CAN COMPLETE DRIVEN IT. AGENCIES THOSE THAT RECEIVED COMPLAINTS AND TRY TO RESPOND TO THEM CAN KEEP UP- YOU KNOW WITH THIS KIND OF. OF POLLY NOT SO MUCH THAT THERE'S NECESSARILY GOING TO BE AN OVERWHELM OF COMPLAINTS. BUT IT'S A COMPLAINT DRIVEN MODEL IS A TOUGH MODEL FOR- FOR ADJUSTING. TO IN EQUITY AND FAIRNESS. HINAULT AND MODERN BUSINESS MODELS ACROSS THE WORKPLACE SO I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING ON THIS AND BRING IN A FORWARD IN A OPOSSUM PRESHEAF HEARING THAT YOU'RE- GOING TO CONTINUE TO. WORK WITH- OPPOSITION AND OTHER FOLKS. WHO ARE TRYING TO. HELP MAKE THIS PIECE ALLEGE. THE BEST PIECE OF ALSO IT CAN BE GOING FOR. TRUMP SO I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT OUT AND- IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE- HERE WELCOME TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME. I REFRAIN FROM- TALKING ABOUT WHY IT'S SO. IMPOSSIBLE WORK FOR THE OPPOSITION BUT- I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO NONE THE LESS- EVEN IF THE BAR MOVES EVERY DAY- BUT WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER HIGH FAT. LOW KEY. THANK YOU SOME MEMBER- IS OUR MOTION ON THE BILL SAYS. STE SENATE NEWMAN MOVE THE BILL. AND THE CENTER DRAWS A WE'RE GONNA WILL GIVE YOU TWO MORE BEFORE THE DAY'S OVER HERE SO. I SEE. THE NEXT ALL RIGHT HE CENTER NEWMAN DIFFERS TO SENATOR ALSO. AND SEND ROSA MOVES A BILL SO BANKS WILL SHE TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE AND YOU TO SHERRY COURTESY HI OR DOES HE DIE OR CHOI BOGUE NO THE SWITCH OF POCONO. BLUEGRASS SILVA HI PRESS I LAYERED HI. THERE I NEWMAN. NEWMAN AYE. OKAY SO THAT THE HOUSE IS ON A FOUR TO ONE VOTE TO BILLS OUT THANK YOU. SENATOR CONSIDERS SOME MEMBER GONZALEZ I KNEW I DO THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS IN THIS ROOM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONSOLES A. B. TEN SEVENTY FOUR PLEASE THANK YOU. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT HERE WHEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY A TEXT ME- THINKING OR TEXTING SENATOR GONZALEZ THAT'S WHEN THE PROBLEMS ARISE SO. OTHERS YOU CAN ASK OTHER SENATORS ABOUT THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AT FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT ALL OF THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH DEFINED THE TERM GUEST SERVICES IN THE BILL IN AGAIN THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS LANGUAGE. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AFTER SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN COVER NINETEEN HAS BECAUSE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY WE MUST MINIMIZE ANY FURTHER DISPLACEMENT JOBS IN THE SECTOR AS THESE WORKERS ARE GETTING BACK ON THEIR FEET. WHEN A SERVICE CONTRACT IS TERMINATED EXISTING LAWS DEVILISH TWENTY YEARS AGO UNDER THE DISPLACED JANITOR OPPORTUNITY ACT PROVIDES JANITORIAL AND BUILDING MAINTENANCE SERVICE WORKERS THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE WORKING AND A NEW CONTRACTOR FOR SIXTY DAY TRANSITION PERIOD. AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR MAKES A NARROW CHANGE BY SIMPLY ADDING SIMILARLY SITUATED HOTEL SERVICE WORKERS TO THIS EXISTING LAW. HOTEL SERVICE JOBS INCLUDING FOOD CLEANING AND GUEST SERVICES ARE SIMILARLY OUTSOURCED AT TIMES AND PERFORMED BY CONTRACTED OR SUBCONTRACTED EMPLOYEES. THESE WORKERS GENERALLY REPORT TO THE SAME WORKSITE EACH STATE WHERE THE UNIFORM OF THE HOTEL THEY ARE CLEAN AND REPORT TO THE MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS ON SITE. REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIFIC CONTRACTOR THAT THEY ARE WORKING FOR. THE EXISTING LAW ONLY APPLIES IF THE NEW CONTRACTOR HAS TWENTY FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES IN THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL ALSO DOES NOT REQUIRE NEW CONTRACTOR JUST KEEP HOTEL WORKERS ON BOARD IF THEY HAD PERFORMANCE OR CONDUCT ISSUES AT WORK OR IF THE NEW CONTRACTOR SIMPLY DOES NOT NEED ALL THE WORKERS TO PERFORM THE SERVICES UNDER THE CONTRACT. AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL MINIMIZE IMMEDIATE DISPLACEMENT OF ALL WORKERS IMPACTED WHEN HOTELS CHANGING SERVICE CONTRACTORS ENSURES THEY HAVE A REASONABLE TRANSITION PERIOD. EXISTING LAW HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY FOR DECADES WE'RE SIMPLY TRACK TAKING THE SAME APPROACH IN TARGETING VERY SIMILAR LOW WAGE WORKFORCE MADE UP PREDOMINATELY LATINO AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS. THIS IS A CRITICAL PART OF STABILIZING JOBS IN THE SECTOR- I HAVE A WITNESS ON THE PHONE. OKAY THANK YOU IN- I BELIEVE LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES CAITLIN VEGA- IN THE FIVE. HIS BIGGEST YOUR ONLINE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KEEP AND DATA ON BEHALF THAT UNITE HERE LOCAL ELEVEN REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOTEL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA. HOTEL INDUSTRY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE FISSURED WORKPLACE. CORPORATION THANK THE CUT COSTS THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DIRECT EMPLOYEES AND RELY ON TEMPORARY AND CONTRACT WORKERS. THESE WORKERS ARE GENERALLY PAID LESS HAVE FEWER BENEFITS AND MAY NOT BE PART OF THE UNION BARGAINING UNIT. AS TEMPORARY WORKERS THEY ARE AT GREATER RISK OF THE PIECES FROM BLEACH STAFF TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THEY KNOW THAT ANYTIME THE CONTRACT CAN CHANGE AND THEY WILL BE OUT OF A JOB. IT'S STILL JUST GRANT THESE WORKERS A MODICUM OF SECURITY BY REQUIRING THAT WHEN A CONTRACTOR HOSPITALITY SERVICES CHANGES HANDS THE WORKERS WILL NOT BE PUNISHED INSTEAD THE SUCCESSOR CONTRACTOR WILL BE ASKED TO MAINTAIN THE WORK FORCE FOR SIXTY DAYS. TO ALLOW WORKERS TO SHOW THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO REMAIN IN THE JOB. SIMILAR LAWS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR JANITORS BUILDING SERVICES GROCERYWORKERS TRANSIT WORKERS AND RECYCLING WORKERS. FOR THESE REASONS WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ OPTION IS THE ONLY. REQUEST YOUR IDOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM AND THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK UP SUPPORT OF AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR. C. NONE WILL GO TO THE OVERFLOW ROOM THE C. NO WITNESSES THERE WAS A MODERATOR TO PLEASE QUEUE UP ANY SUPPORT WITNESSES ON A. B. TEN SEVENTY FOUR AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE VENTURA IT'S TIME. ONE NINE ZERO. WE'LL GO TO LINE. SIXTY FIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON SHOULD INVESTMENT ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED HERE INTERNATIONAL UNION AND THE TEAMSTERS AND SUPPORT. BY SEVENTY FIVE. BERNAY BAYARDO WITH AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. BY. NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER SHURMUR'S MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO EXPORT. BY. NINETY TWO. UNION MEMBERS STRIPPED OUT MAYOR WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES STRONG SUPPORT OF THE ECONOMY AND BUT BEFORE THANK YOU. THE FINAL CALL FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT- WE'RE GONNA GO TO LEAD OPPOSITION WITH THE SNOW. IN THAT WOULD BE JOHN COLDWELL. MISTER CALDERON IF YOU WERE ON THE TELECONFERENCE WINE YOU MAY PROCEED AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN CANARY YES WE CAN LOAN CLEARED. OKAY RICHARD SHERMAN- DUNK ALTHOUGH REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BOUTIQUE AND BREAKFAST IN. UNDER AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR A HOTEL THAT WANTED TO GET RID OF A POOR PERFORMANCE SERVICE PROVIDER. WOULD HAVE TO REQUIRE THE REPLACEMENT COMPANIES HIRE EMPLOYEES. FROM THE TERMINATED COMPANY. HERE'S HOW ONE OF OUR MEMBERS EXPLAIS PROBLEM. QUOTE ONE OF MY HOTELS HAVE A THIRD PARTY CONTRACT FOR OUR VALET SERVICE. ALTHOUGH THE VALET EMPLOYEES ARE NOT HOTEL EMPLOYEES THEY DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH MY CUSTOMERS. AND CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT MY BUSINESS IF THE PERFORMANCE IS POOR. IF I CHOOSE TO CHANGE MY CONTRACT VALLEY SERVICE WHY WOULD I WANT THE NEW COMPANY TO HIRE BACK THE SAME EMPLOYEES. OF THE CURRENT VALLEY SERVICE IF THAT IS THE REASON FOR CANCELING THE CONTRACT. ON QUOTE. THE BILL SUPPORTERS SAY THE NEW COMPANIES WOULD NOT HAVE TO HIRE THE BAD APPLES BUT IN FACT. THEY COULD REFUSE TO HIRE SOMEONE ONLY IF THE NEW COMPANY NOT THE HOTEL HAS QUOTE. REASONABLE AND SUBSTANTIATED BECAUSE NOT TIRED THE PARTICULAR EMPLOYEE ON QUOTE OR- IF AFTER THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS THEY HAVE TO PROVE THE EMPLOYEE IS. THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVE THE EMPLOYEE IS LESS THAN QUOTE SATISFACTORY. ON QUOTE. IF THE NEW COMPANY CAN'T OR WON'T MEET THESE LEGAL THRESHOLDS THE HOTEL IS STUCK WITH THE BAD EMPLOYEES. BETTER THE REASON FOR THE CANCELLATION OF THE CONTRACT. UNLIKE THE- AUTHORS HOTEL RECALL AND RETENTION BILL WHICH ONLY COVERS HOTELS WITH OVER FIFTY ROOMS THIS BILL APPLIES TO EVEN THE SMALLEST BED AND BREAKFASTS. AND HOTELS BUT TYPICALLY HAVE FEW STAFF AND CONTRACT WITH SERVICE. COMPANIES FROM- SERVICES. YEAH AMENDMENTS SLIGHT NOW THE DE. OF GUESTS. HOWEVER THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT DEFINE HOTEL SERVICES SO THE BILL COULD APPLY TO COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES SUCH AS LEGAL ACCOUNTING BOOKKEEPING SALES MARKETING. SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS OF FEDERAL. THE LODGING INDUSTRY WAS DEVASTATED BY COVERT PANT PANDEMIC THIS BILL WILL SEVERELY IMPACT THEIR RECOVERY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OF I BELIEVE WE HAVE ANOTHER OPPOSITION WITH IS. LISTED AS LEADERSHIP HOFFMAN. YOU'RE HERE PRESENT GREAT THANK YOU WHAT WELCOME TO BEGIN THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR TERM MEMBERS ACTUALLY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR IT IS PLEASE GENERAL PERTINI ACTORS ENACTED IN RESPONSE IN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND ISSUES ARISING OR THE LOSS OF ONE CONTRACT MENTAL JANITORIAL PLEASE HAD NO OTHER WORK. UNDER THAT LAW FROM TWENTY YEARS AGO ANYTIME THERE'S A CHANGE IN A CONTRACTING SERVICE THE NEW CONTRACTORS REQUIRED TO HIRE ALL OF THE FORMER CONTRACTORS EMPLOYEES YOU CAN BE SUED IN COURT IF THEY DON'T AND IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO HIRE THEM IF YOU DON'T NEED THEM IT'S ONLY IF YOU NEED A QUOTE FEWER THAT ARE REQUIRED TO DO THAT JOB SO EVEN IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE STAFF TO DO IT. YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TO HIRE THE OTHER CONTRACTORS EMPLOYEES THAT LAWLER SAID ORIGINALLY VETOED BY GOVERNOR DAVIS AND THE CONCERN OF THE TROUBLING PRECEDENT THE LAW WOULD SET FOR REGULATING PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS AND THIS BILLS EXAMPLE THAT CONCERN COMING TO FRUITION. THE BILL IS TAKING THAT STATUTE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES FOR THAT SPECIFIC INDUSTRY FOR TWENTY YEARS AGO AND BROADLY APPLYING IT TO NEARLY EVERY SERVICE A HOTEL OR SMALL GRAIN BREAKFAST CONTRACT FOR THE AUTHOR THE PROPONENTS LARGE RECYCLE BIN NINETEEN IS A NEED FOR THE BILL AND POINT TO SIMILAR COMPANY TEAM SPECIFIC LOCAL ORDINANCES WITH THE BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO COVER NINETEEN IT ANYWAY. WELL RECENT AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN TO SOMEONE CLARIFY WHAT WAS MEANT BY GUEST SERVICES THE LIST OF SERVICES IS STILL BROAD AND VAGUELY ALSO INCLUDES ANY QUOTE SECTION SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SERVICES ANOTHER CONCERN WE HAVE IS THE BILL APPLIES TO. PNB'S IN HOTELS OF ALL SIZES IT'S OFTEN THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE THE MOST NEED FOR CONTRACTORS AND THIS BILL MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO EVER CHANGE CONTRACTORS OR TRACK NEW ONES EVEN SB NINETY THREE THE RIGHT TO RECALL MANDATE THAT WAS HE TOLD LAST YEAR AND SUBSEQUENTLY NARROWED CONTAINS A MINIMUM ROOMS ARE SOLD IN THIS LIMITED TO COLD IT. FOR THE WRONG EMPLOYEE MUST WORK FIFTEEN HOURS PER WEEK TO FALL UNDER THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL IT DOES NOT STATE THAT THE FIFTEEN HOURS MUST BE PERFORMED AT ONE HOTEL EMPLOYEE WORKING TWO HOURS AT HOTEL A IN THIRTY EIGHT HOURS A HOTEL BE WHISTLE AND FALL UNDER THE BILL IF THAT CONTRACT WAS CANCELED WHICH DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE WE ARE STRICTLY. OPPOSE AN ORIGIN ABOUT. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR- THOSE ARE ANYONE WHO PRO. COMMITTEE WHO WISH TO EX. AND POSITION ON THIS BILL. IN THIS ROOM- IT WILL TURN TO THE OVERFLOW ROOM TO LOOK FOR TESTIMONY THERE THERE IS- NOBODY PRESENT WELCOME BACK TO THE MODERATOR AS A MODERATOR ON A. B. TEN SEVENTY FOUR. PLEASE QUEUE UP ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES PLEASE. TO GO TO LINE. NINETY THREE- CHAIR NUMBERS NEARLY THE MONEY CALIFORNIA CALCIFICATION. BLIND SEVENTY VERY. HELLO THIS IS FRED MADE ON BEHALF OF THE TRI COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALLIANCE IN OPPOSITION. AND THE FINAL CALL FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE BUTTON ZERO PRESS. ONE ZERO. SURE THERE'S NO ONE OUT TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. OKAY THANK YOU- FOR THAT MODERATOR WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOW FOR. INSURANCE QUESTIONS AND DIALOGUE FROM CENTER NEWMAN DID YOU WANNA GO FIRST- I GUESS IDEA AB THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF BILLS THAT COME BOTH RATIONAL TO THROUGH THROUGH THE FROM THE ASSEMBLY RECENTLY THAT THAT ALL USE COVERT AS KIND OF THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE BUT DIED IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND OF DR I GUESS THERE IS SOME MERIT I THINK HIS OFFICE POINT YOU COULD COULD YOU. CLARIFY THE NEXUS OF ANY WITH CODE ON THIS BILL AT THIS POINT TIME. ALTHOUGH COVE IT HAS- DECIMATED THE WORKERS IN THIS INDUSTRY MORE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NECESSARY BEFORE COVE IT AND WILL BE NECESSARY AFTER CO BAD AND I'LL EXPLAIN THIS. SO WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED DURING COBIT AND OF COURSE OUR RETENTION- LANGUAGE THAT WE GOT THROUGH THE BUDGET HELPS BUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN IS A CONTRACT EXPIRES YOU HAVE A NEW CONTRCTOR COMING IN. AND SO EVEN THOUGH THAT THAT WORK OR IF THEY WORK FOR THE HALL HOTEL WOULD HAVE RETENTION RIGHTS. THEY THEY AREN'T BEING CALLED BACK FOR BECAUSE THEIR CONTRACT HAS HAS BEEN- DISMISSED IF YOU WILL OR REPLACED. SO THAT HAS A AFFECT ON THOSE WORKERS HOWEVER. JUST LIKE THE JANITORIAL WORKERS THIS IS BEEN IN PLACE FOR TWENTY YEARS BECAUSE LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE IN UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE REALIZE THAT MAYBE CO THAT HAS MADE US REALIZE THAT EVEN MORE- THAT IT SEEMS THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO AND WE WERE WORKING ON THIS PRIOR TO COVE IT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT JUST BE IT BECAME MORE MAGNIFIED. THAT THERE WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE OF CONTRACTOR YOU'RE WORKING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PRIMARILY M. AS AN IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE- PRIMARILY AT. AS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN LOW. PAID JOBS WHO- BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN- A NEW CAR. AND SHOULD LEAST HAVE THE OP TO PROVE THEMSELVES IT NOT RE. THE HùTO KEEP EIGHTY EMPLOY. WHO IS NOT PER. IN- AT PAR IN FACT THE- WHO KNOWS THAT THE BEST IS THAT IT THE HOTEL- THEMSELVES TOO AND THEY CAN TELL AND SHARE THAT WITH THE NEW CONTRACTOR. THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE- THE COMPANY TO KEEP A BAD EMPLOYEE IF YOU WELL AND IN FACT BUT WHAT PEOPLE MISS IN THIS ISN'T LIKE NORMAL CONTRACTING HAS IT WOULD SEEM. THE SUPERVISORS AND MANAGEMENT ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE HOTEL NOT THE CONTRACTOR- MOST OFTEN SO THEY ARE ALREADY HAVING THAT INFORMATION ABOUT EMPLOYEES WHO SHOULD BE DISMISSED AND ARE LREADY IN THE PROCESS. OF DISMISSING THOSE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT. AND SECONDING I GUESS MISS OFTEN REYES SO THE ISSUE AROUND. FIFTEEN HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT- AND THE POSSIBLE TO ME MY DO SEPARATE OUR A DIFFERENT. LOOK IT YOU WILL TO. THE NEXT CLARIFYING THE LANGUAGE AS WELL. THAT IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THAT ARGUMENT AND I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE ANYBODY WHO HAS- WHEN AS PART TIME EMPLOYMENT THERE ARE MANY-WORKERS WHO WORK AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN ORDER TO. COBBLE TOGETHER A FULL TIME SALARY- BUT THAT LOCATION THAT THEY'RE WORKING OUT IS CONSIDERED THEIR JOB FOR THAT MOUNT SO- I'M ASSUMING IT IF AN EMPLOYER. AND EMPLOYEE WANTS TO STAY WITH A CERTAIN CONTRACTOR AND THEY'RE BEING MAINTAINED BY THAT CONTRACTOR AND OTHER POSITIONS THAT'S IRRELEVANT TO WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK AT THAT. LOCATION OKAY MA'AM YOU THAT THE LARGER CONCERNS YOU NOTICE I MEAN AS WITH YUR PREVIOUS BILLS THE WORLD'S CHANGED GREAT DEAL LAST TWENTY YEARS AGO. NUMBER SPECIALIZED SERVICES THE IN OWN COUNTRIES PROVIDE PARTICULAR KIND OF NARROW SERVICES JOE TELLS YOU ROOMS AND PARKING CARS WELL THE YOU KNOW. MORE LIKE RESERVATION TAKING IN. THE RESERVATION TAKING ISN'T PART OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD ANSWER WHY I WAS GOING TO SAY AND I AM GRATEFUL OR DIE GESAMTE COMMITTEE FOR PIG SHIFTING- THE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY IN THOSE AREAS BUT- YOU KNOW THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY. SOMEBODY WORKS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AND SO. AB IT SEEMS CHANGE REGIONAL FIFTY HOURS IS GOING OF A SMALL AMOUNT CUT THAT UP SOME MORE. MAYBE THAT'S REASONABLE TO CONSIDER SOME CLARIFICATION. FIFTEEN HOURS THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST WORK FIFTEEN HOURS AT THAT PRIMARY LOCATION AT THE PRIMARY LOCATION HIGHER IS THAT WE ARE SUGGEST WELL ADULT GAS I MEAN THAT THERE WAS MISS HAWKINS CONCERNED THAT IT WASN'T AT ONE LOCATION MIGHT BE A MOBILE WITH MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. BUT WE CAN LEAVE IT I SEEM TO CONFUSE YOU M. I AM CONFUSED A LITTLE BIT. WE COULD TALK FURTHER WE DON'T HAVE TO SUBMIT MY UNDERSTANDING FROM HER FROM HER TESTAMENT ACTUALLY IS SHE STILL HERE SHE'S STILL HERE SO IF YOU WOULD MIND CLARIFYING. MEASUREMENTS SO I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR YOU IN A WAY THAT DOES MAKE SENSE. SO YOU KNOW TWO OF OUR POINTS I THINK RATES ARE UNDER THE DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL. THERE'S KIND OF TWO LIMITATIONS RIGHT ONE IS THAT A CONTRACTOR MEANS SOMEONE WHO PLAYS TWENTY FIVE OR MORE AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THERE. WHETHER THAT MEANS TWENTY FIVE OR MORE PEOPLE AT LIKE ONE HOTEL OR ONE LOCATION OR NOT AND THEN. THE SECOND AND THERE'S NO COURT CASES INTERPRETING THAT'S RUNNING SHORT THE SECOND I THINK IT IS A THE FIFTEEN HOUR PER WEEK **** AND SUBSECTION C. OF TEN SIXTEEN- THAT SO ESSENTIALLY FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO FALL UNDER THIS BILL. YOU HAVE TO WORK A LEAST FIFTEEN HOURS PER WEEK YOUR PRIMARY PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT HAS TO BE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE AN ALCATEL SERVICES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I AM A HOTEL WORKER UNDER THIS BILL RIGHT I PROVIDE- I DON'T VALLEY SERVICES I GUESS AND I WORK. FORTY HOURS A WEEK BUT I WORK FIVE HOURS A WEEK AT ONE HOTEL BUT RICK THIRTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK AND A DIFFERENT HOTEL AND THE HOTEL CONTRACTOR I WORK FIVE HOURS A WEEK IS CANCELED. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I KNOW FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEE. UNDER THIS. ACT AND SO YOU KNOW I WOULD THEN. THE NEW VALLEY AT THAT SUPPORT TO WHERE I ONLY WORK FIVE HOURS. WOULD HAVE STILL HAVE TO HIRE ME AWAY. I WANNA BE CLEAR AND NOT VETS IN THIS AN JUST TRY TO. THERE YOU HAVE IT THAT'S HELD OUT SERVICE WORK YOU'RE A TRAIN AT THE LOOK. WHERE YOUR PROVIDER THE VALLEYS SERVICES SO THEY DO GET BROKEN BY FIVE BUT THERE MIGHT AN EMERGENCY SO. WE SOMEBODY HAD TO FILL IN. AB I DON'T WANT TO I. YOU KNOW SHE SAID SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND. AND SHE'S NOT SURE THIS WORKS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN EXISTENCE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THERE'S NO LAWSUIT TO SUGGEST THAT IT DOESN'T WORK. SO I AM NOT ONE WHO'S GOING TO COME IN AND CHANGE THE JANITORIAL PROTECTION- THAT HAS WORKED FOR TWENTY PLUS YEARS. AND HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS IT HAS THE SAME TYPE OF MIGRATORY NATURE AS- CONTACTED BACK MORE SO THAN THEY DO IN A HOTEL ASPECT. THAT BEING SAID I'D I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK THROUGH THAT- WE ARE SAYING IF YOU WORK FIFTEEN HOURS AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION YOUR CONTRACTOR THAT. THAT HOTEL M. THERE MIGHT BE A SITUATION WHERE A CHAIN OF HOTELS HAS THE SAME CONTRACTOR THEY'RE GOING FROM HOTEL TO HOTEL. AND THAT THAT'S SIMILAR TO JANITORIAL WE STILL REQUIRE THE CONTRACTOR TAKE TO OFFER- THE EMPLOYEE SIXTY SIXTY DAYS OF SERVICE SIXTY DAYS AFTER THAT. PRETTY CLEAR GET RID OF. AND AS SOON MEANS MANY FIND A CLARIFYING- I MEAN I YOU KNOW I STILL CONTEND HONESTLY THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR IN THE STATUE THAT HAS TO BE THE SAME LOCATION AND MAYBE VALLEY WAS A BAD. EXAMPLE RIGHT MAYBE SOMETHING MORE APPROPRIATE WOULD BE I DON'T PROVIDING SOME SORT REALLY FOOD AND BEVERAGE SERVICE OR SOMETHING- AND JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT I SAID IS NOT THAT THERE'S EVER BEEN QUITE NOT BEEN CLAIMS OR LAWSUITS IT'S NEVER. BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A PUBLISHED DECISION. CLARIFYING THIS SPECIFIC PROVISION THAT'S WHAT I MEANT AND AGAIN MY INTEREST HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS NOT. TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE BILL BUT JUST YOU KNOW TO PLACE ON RECORD TO IT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE. I JUST I HAVE TO SAY FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN SUCH A SUCCESS FOR- FOR. LOW INCOME WORKERS AT IN THE JANITORIAL- OPPORTUNITY ACT ARE. YOU KNOW IS THAT THAT I MEAN THERE THERE HAS BEEN VERY AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN- MANY LAWSUITS OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER CLEAR FINER PUBLISHED ON THE SUBJECT AND THAT SHOULD JUST SHOW US WHAT A SUCCESS IT IS JUST PICKING APART SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A FUTURE. BECAUSE FOR A LAWSUIT I GUESS WE COULD DO THAT FOR EVERY BILL THAT WHEN WE HAVE A LOT IN WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS NOT CHANGING. EXISTING LAW WE'RE TAKING THE EXISTING LAW AND ADDING SIMILARLY SITUATED EMPLOYEES TO THAT LAW JANITORS AT HOTELS HAVE THIS PROTECTION. THEY HAVE THIS PROTECTION RIGHT NOW SO IF YOU GO TO THE- THE SHERATON RIGHT OVER HERE YOU'LL SEE THAT THE JANITORIAL STAFF IS NOT HOTEL STAFF THEY ACTUALLY WORK FOR A CONTRACTOR. IF THE HOTEL CHANGES THE CONTRACTOR FOR THE JANITORIAL WORK THOSE EMPLOYEES HAVE THE RIGHT TO STAY THERE FOR SIXTY DAYS WITH THE NEW CONTRACTOR TO PROVE THEMSELVES ALL WE'RE SAYING IS. SO SHOULD THE HOTEL HOUSEKEEPER- IT SEEMS TO ME AN OBVIOUS THING SINCE IT'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL- AND WE HAVE NO PARAMETERS ON ON THE- THE SIZE OF THE LOCATION OF THE JANITOR TO WORKING THAT WE SHOULD EXTEND THIS TO SIMILARLY SITUATED. BY THE WAY MAINLY WOMEN EMPLOYEES. PROJECT THAT I GOT TAKE THAT TO MEAN YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK FOR THE OPPOSITION TO CLICK. I AM WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I I'VE GOT TO BE REALLY HONEST WITH THIS BECAUSE I DON'T I NEVER MAKE A PROMISE THAT I CAN'T KEEP MY I CANNOT CHANGE THE EXISTING. CHEN CHOI OPPORTUNITY ACT IN ANY WAY- FOR THE PROVISIONS THAT EXISTS THERE FOR AN ACT THAT'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL AND HAS PROVIDED SO IF YOU IN FACT NONE THEY CAN'T EVEN COME UP WITH A SINGLE PROBLEM THAT'S PROVIDED- AND I. AND I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THEY THINK THEIR CONCERN IS THAT AS YOU EXTEND. THE ACT INTO OTHER VERTICALS TO JUST TO ENSURE THAT WHERE THOSE- SORT OF WORK FUNCTIONS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAT IT'S PROBABLY CALIFORNIA. ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S WHAT THE REASONS WE WORK SO CLOSELY TIED TO FIND THOSE THOSE OCCUPATIONS THAT LINE UP WITH- BOTH THE WORKFORCE IN THE TYPE OF WORK THAT ARE TO BE DONE BY JANITORS. WHO SHOULD THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY SIR NEWMAN- ANY ANYBODY- SENATOR ALSO. YEAH I WANT TO AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS- I SPENT SEVERAL DECADES. IN THE HOTEL AND FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY. AND- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES WE HAVE HAD SOME VERSION OF THIS. PASSED IN LOS ANGELES AND THE SKY IS NOT FALLING THINGS AREN'T YOU KNOW THERE'S NO BIRTH QUAKE IN THAT INDUSTRY IS DOING QUITE WELL SHORT OF THE PANDEMIC- AND IN A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS WE SO WE PASSED VERY VARIOUS FORMS OF A RETENTION NORTON IS THE FIRST WAS. OUT OF LOS ANGELES LAX AND WHEN THOSE CON CONTRACTED OUT WORKERS WERE CHANGED. FOR WHATEVER DIFFERENT REASONS. THOSE WORKERS HUNDREDS OF THEM WERE FIRED. HUNDREDS WERE TERMINATED IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH A FEW PLOYS WHO WEREN'T PERFORMING AT PAR HUNDREDS. AND THE HUNDREDS WHO WERE WE PLATE WILL BE REPLACED. WHEN FROM. SEVERAL DOLLARS AN HOUR HIGHER THAN MINIMUM WAGE DOWN TO MINIMUM WAGE NO HEALTH INSURANCE NO PENSION NO NOTHING. AND I'VE SEEN SO MANY EXAMPLES OF THAT BEFORE THE STATE JANITORIAL OF LAW WAS PASSED THE CITY HAD- JANITORIAL SERVICES IN THE AND ALL OF THE LIBRARIES A CHANGE CONTRACTOR. ALL THOSE WORKERS WERE FIRED ALL OF THEM WERE TERMINATED AND IT JUST HAS HAPPENED. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THE SAME THING WITH HOTELS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A FEW EMPLOYEES. WHO AREN'T PERFORMING AT PAR THAT COULD EASILY BE TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE THE HOTEL COULD TELL THE COMPANY DOING IN CHARGE HEY THIS IS WRONG YOU GOT TO FIX IT IF IT'S AN EMPLOYEE. YOU GOT TO DEAL WITH IT BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN USED AS A WAY TO- FOR THE INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR TO PAY A LOT LESS. NO BENEFITS AND NO ANY KIND OF PROTECTION SO I THINK IT'S- IT'S REALLY GREAT. TO GET A PASS A LAW LIKE THIS PAST. THAT WOULD WOULD PROTECT THESE- HOTEL WORKERS. I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE HOTEL INDUSTRY. I WAS ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE LOS ANGELES. CONVENTION AND VISITORS BUREAU FOR MANY YEARS- AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING TO HELP THAT INDUSTRY PROSPER. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT SHOULD BE DONE ON THE BACKS OF THESE WORKERS WHO GIVE SO MUCH WHO WORKS SO HARD. AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE CONTRACTOR YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY LOSE YOUR JOB THAT'S JUST. FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR SO THANK YOU. SIX ROSALYN OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MEMBERS YOUR. MAKE SURE HAVE RIGHT HERE IN THE QUESTIONS. WHAT HAPPENS- IF THE CONTRACTOR THAT CURRENTLY HOUSES EMPLOYEES- THAT WORK FOR HIM OR HER. MOVE ON WHEN HE MOVES ON TO THE NEXT CONTRACT WHAT HAPPENS IS IT PLEASE IF HE NEEDS THAT I'M JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW- BECAUSE WORKERS SOON MEAN HERE INFERRING THAT THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO BE- UNEMPLOYED AT THIS PARTICULAR SITE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CONTRACTOR MOVES TO A DIFFERENT SITE AND HE NEEDS THESE EMPLOYEES TO GO TO THE NEXT CONTRACT- PER SE. HOW DOES HOW DOES HOW DO WE WORK AROUND THAT- NOTION FOR THE NEED FOR THE ACTUAL CONTRACTOR MOVING FORWARD M. WELL A CONTRACTOR OBVIOUSLY HAS NO RIGHT EVER TO FORCE SOMEBODY TO WORK FOR THEM THAT'S FOUNDATIONAL I THINK TO OUR COUNTRY- BUT OBVIOUSLY IF IT'S A CONTRACTOR THAT THE EMPLOYEE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE EMPLOYEE WILL MOVE WITH THE CONTRACTOR. IF THE EMPLOYEE AND I THINK WHAT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY AND WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO. A TACKLE THIS RENOWNED OF LAW. THEY HAVE WHERE ALL. THINK OF THEM AS WELL. AT THIS HOTEL NOT FOR THE CALL. RIGHT SO SUPER. MAYBE AT THE HOTEL THERE WERE IN THE UNIFORM OF THE WHOLE. YOU KNOW I GO TO EVERY DAY WORK FOR THE SHERATON BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY WORK THE SHERATON I WORK FOR A CONTRACTOR AND ALL I'M ASKING FROM AN EMPLOYEE STANDPOINT IS. ARE YOU CHANGE THE CONTRACTOR THIS IS WHERE I WORK GIVE ME SIXTY DAYS TO PROVE MYSELF TO THE NEW CONTRACTOR. IF I FEEL LIKE I'M WORKING FOR THIS CONTRACTOR IN VALLEY WAS A GOOD. EXAMPLE IN THIS SENSE RIGHT SO I. I HATE USING SPECIFICS BUT YOU KNOW IT IN VALLEY INDUSTRY THERE'S TWO OR THREE BIG VALLEY OPERATORS RIGHT- ONE OF THEM HAPPENS TO BE UNION SO YOU SAY. WELL LOOK AT THIS I HAD THIS UNION TEAMSTER JOB WITH ACE PARKING- THAT THE- HOTELS NO LONGER USING THIS I'D RATHER GO. TO THIS OTHER PLACE WITH WITH AND BY THE WAY I PROTECTIONS BECAUSE I'M- HAVE UNION CONTRACTS I WILL GET OFFERED A JOB SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND I MAY WANT TO GO DO THAT THE THAT THE EMPLOYEE DOESN'T HAVE TO STAY AT THE LOCATION. HOWEVER IF THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THAT'S BEEN THEIR JOB TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY PROVE THEMSELVES WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE. WHO HAS THE LEAST LEVERAGE IN THE SITUATION. AND IT HAS BEEN DOING THE MOST AMOUNT OF WORK. SO THERE'S NO- PRIORITY AS TO WHO THE EMPLOYEE HAS THE LOYALTY TO WHETHER IT'S THE CONTRACTOR WHO EMPLOYSTHEM DIRECTLY OR THE FACILITY THAT HAS CURRENTLY THE CONTRA. WHAT THE HELL TO PER SE OR THE MARRIOTT IN THIS CASE SO THERE'S REALLY WITH THIS BILL THE WOULDN'T BE AB EIGHTY. IT LOYALTY PRIORITY FOR THE EMPLOYEE AS TO WHO THEY'RE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY WITH THAT WELL I GUESS TO BE UP TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE OF HOW THEY FELT THAT LITTLE TEAR WHETHER- BUT THE PROSPECTS WERE IN EACH PLACE. OKAY. I GOTTA BE HONEST- IT'S UNUSUAL RIGHT I GET ACTUALLY GAVE UP AN EXAMPLE MAYBE I SHOULDN'T OF A SERVICE WORKER WHO MAY WANT TO MOVE WITH THE CONTRACTOR BECAUSE THE CONTRACTOR ACTUALLY PROVIDES MORE THAN THAN NORMAL CONTRACTORS IN THAT SERVICE BUT THAT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL- AND USUALLY PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF THE-WORK THEY'RE DOING ANY WORK PLACE AND WHAT THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO THAT RIGHT AYE. I'M WORKING AT THE HILTON BECAUSE IT'S ON THE BUS LINE FROM WHERE I LIVE AND I HAVE TO DROP MY KIDS OFF AND YOU KNOW IT MAY NOT SUIT ME TO GO TO IT AT DIFFERENT LOCATION TO WORK AND I WANT THE OPPORTUNITY PROVED HIMSELF SO IT IS FROM FROM A- AT AT AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAS VERY LITTLE LEVERAGE OTHERWISE WHO WANTS JUST THE OPPORTUNITYTO STAY EMPLOYED AT THE SAME LOCATION HOWEVER IF THERE ARE. THEY REALLY LIKE THEIR CONTRACTOR THEIR OFFER ANOTHER POSITION ALLOWS THEM TO DO THAT AS WELL. FROM. OKAY I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT THANK YOU. ANYTHING ELSE. THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- HI I JUST WANNA SAY I THINK I'M SATISFIED I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION- FIRST OF ALL WITH REGARD TO. IT'S JUST IN TERMS OF THE TESTIMONY HEARD MIXING UP LOCATION WITH- CONTRACTOR EMPLOYER WHICH IS TO BE WELL DEFINED IN THE- IN THE- IN THE BILL IN AND I THINK COULD BE ANALYSIS DID A GOOD JOB OF. SEPARATING THAT OUT IT ISN'T NECESSARILY THE SAME LOCATION IT IS THE SAME EMPLOYER CONTRACTOR- THAT IS REALLY- AT THE HEART OF THE MATTER HERE IN. THE WE KNOW PUBLIC SECTOR CONTRACTING IT'S VERY COMMON TO HAVE THESE KIND OF RETENTION AGREEMENTS I THINK YOU'RE BRINGING THIS OVER INTO A PRIVATE SECTOR. A SCENARIO WITH THE SAME PRINCIPLES INVOLVED OF- OFFERING RETENTION FIRST WHEN A NEW CONTRACTOR COMES IN SO- I AM I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL I APPRECIATE YOU. WORKING THROUGH AGAIN WORKING THROUGH AMENDMENTS WITH COMMITTEE STAFF HERE- AND GETTING THOSE CLEAR ENOUGH FOR US TO. BE PREPARED TO MOVE THE BILL TODAY SUCH A MOVE BILL TODAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IS THERE A MOTION- ECONOMY OF CONFUSED GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT WASN'T MY JOBS. NO I APPRECIATE AGAIN I HAVE TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND MY STAFF WHO WORKED SO- HAN TRYING ON DEFINITIONS AND YOU YOU KNOW SO WHEN THE THINGS YOU REALLY HAVE TO GET RIGHT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT LEAVING OUT TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE IN YOU'RE NOT BRINGING IN TOO MANY PEOPLE SO. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT I WANT TO NOTE AS WELL- I ACTUALLY CARRIED THE BILL FOR GROCERY WORKER RETENTION AND THAT WAS- ACTUALLY AT SALE OF AN ENTIRE GROCERY STORE. WHEN A GROCERY STORE SOLD THE WORKERS GET SIXTY DAYS TO PROVE. THEMSELVES TO NEW OWNER THIS MAY BE A COMPLETE DIFFERENT OF GROCERY STORE IT CAN. A DIFFERENT SIZE THE GROCERY STORE- THAT WAS PASSED AND SIGNED FIVE YEARS AGO OKAY AND IT WAS CONSIDERED A JOB KILLER THE TIME AND AGAIN WE HAVE A HEARD. A PROBLEM AYE IT'S SOUNDS GUESS AND- LIKE SOMETHING THAT THAT'S MUCH MORE ONEROUS THAN IT IS AND IN THIS SITUATION WE TALK ABOUT CONTRACTORS WHO CHANGE AND SHIFT OFTEN- IN ORDER IN GETTING A NEW CONTRACT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO HIRE NEW PEOPLE ANYWAY. THEY OFTEN TRY TO HIRE NEW PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'LL REDUCE THE COST OF THEIR WORKFORCE- WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TO GIVE THESE WORKERS ARE OPPORTUNITY. TO THEMSELVES TO A NEW CONTRACT. AND WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH THOSE WORKERS WHO HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE TO BE ABLE TO. INSIST IF YOU WELL OR OR FORGE- A REQUIREMENT A RELATIONSHIP WITH A NEW CONTRACTOR AND SO GIVING THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY JUST TO PROVE THEMSELVES FOR SIXTY DAYS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A- TO ME. A TO HONOR SITUATION. AND TODAY IT'S PERFECT TIMING TO DO IT DO IT QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE IN TODAY'S LABOR MARKET I THINK- THE ONE. ONE THING THAT. PEOPLE ARE SCRAMBLING FORCE MORE SERVICE WORKERS SO. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL WE DO FROM CENTER DRAWS OVER. HE AND WITH THAT METASOMA SHOULD CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS COURTESY RIGHT COURTESY AYE OR TROUBLE. NO BUT CHOI BOGUE NO THE REST SO.

I KNOW YOU WERE HERE 2% AB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT WHICH ALLOWS HEALTH CARE WORKERS PROVIDING DIRECT CARE TO OVERRIDE A HOSPITAL ALGORITHM WHEN IT'S WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE WHICH INCLUDES PHYSICIAN APPROVAL AND ULTIMATELY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THIS BILL DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE OVERRIDE A PHYSICIAN'S ORDERS AS WELL AS SPECIFIES THAT SCOPE OF PRACTICE COULD ALSO INCLUDE APPROVAL FROM A DOCTOR OF PODIATRIC MEDICINE REMOVED OPPOSITION FROM THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS THE CALIFORNIA PROJECTED MEDICAL SOCIAL EDUCATION. AND A CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION ALL HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION WHILE ALGORITHMS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL USED TO KEEP IT USED TO HELP DECIDE THE BEST COURSE OF TREATMENT FOR MILLIONS OF PATIENTS A YEAR. IF MADE BY A AND CPAS RATIO BIAS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY HAS WELL BEEN DOCUMENTED. IN TWENTY NINETEEN RESEARCHERS STUDIED THE OPERATIVE A WIDELY USE HOSPITAL ALGORITHM AND FOUND IT EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT RACIAL BIASES WHENEVER FOR BLACK PATIENTS TO EXTRA CARE PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER THAN WHITE-PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH TECHNOLOGY CAN COMPLEMENT AND SKIP THE SKILLS AND DECISION MAKING OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. IT IS IMPORTANT IT IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH THE INTERVENTION OF A NURSE. IN MY TREATMENT OF DIABETES AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT FORTY POUNDS LIGHTER. AND MUCH HEALTHIER AND BECAUSE THE ADVICE OF A NURSE SOME OF YOU MAY EVEN KNOWS THAT THERE WAS THE DAUGHTER. OF FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MARIE DONNELLY BUT BUT DAUGHTER SISTER DIMMER LINDEGAARD BERMAN TIMELY COULD ADVISE ME. ON HOW ON HOW TO EAT HEALTHIER DRINK MY WATER GET MY REST GET OFFICE DRESS WHICH WAS KIND OF HARD TO DO HIS MOTHER TODAY. AND WITHIN A YEAR- I WAS OFF INSULIN. BECAUSE OF ALL THREE THE ALGORITHM. THE DOCTOR AND A NURSE ALL COLLABORATING TOGETHER TO GIVE ME ADVICE ESPECIALLY THE NURSE WHO TALKED TO ME LIKE MY MOTHER MADE ME. DO SOME THINGS THAT I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE. OTHERWISE TO SAY BASICALLY SAVED MY LIFE. BOB WE ARE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE INCREASINGLY PASSED BILLS TO ADDRESS IMPLICIT BIASES OF INDIVIDUALS. SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE MORE INGRAINED INTO OUR SOCIETY IS ONLY RIGHT THAT WE TAKE THE SAME STEPS TO ADDRESS ITS LIMITATIONS AS WELL. ESPECIALLY IF WE MOVED TOWARD- HEALTH CARE WE'RE TALKING TO TELEMEDICINE. WE NEED AND REMEMBER NOT TO REMOVE THE PERSONAL. PART OF THAT SO IT'S TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE MORE INGRAINED IN OUR SOCIETY MAJOR HOSPITALS ACROSS THE STATE ALREADY RECOGNIZED THIS NEED AND HAVE INCORPORATED THE SAME RETALIATION PROTECTIONS THIS BILL IS CREATING INTO THEIR OWN. POLICIES SUCH ALTERNATELY WHEN WE ALLOW ALGORITHMS DOCTORS AND NURSES TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE REDUCE THE IMPACT THE BIASES IN ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE. WE WILL SAVE LIVES. AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT PROMOTES PATIENT WELL BEING IMPROVES PATIENT QUALITY OF CARE BY PUTTING THE TRUST BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE WORKERS.

RESULTING IN A RAPID DISSEMINATION OF UNDERDEVELOPED AND POTENTIALLY BY A MODEL WHICH MAY EXACERBATE. THE DISPARITIES GAP. THERE IS HOPE A CAN GUIDE DECISIONS INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES AND THAT'S QUITE FAR. HOWEVER IT SHOULD NOT LIMIT THE INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL JUDGMENT. FOR A HEALTHCARE WORKERS ABILITY TO ACT AS A PATIENT ADVOCATE. ALGORITHM SHOULD NOT DETERMINE THE CARE NEEDED BY PATIENTS. GIVEN THE PERVASIVENESS OF BY A FAILURE TO PROACTIVELY DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION STRATEGIES DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC WITH EXACERBATING EXISTING HEALTH DISPARITIES UNDER IN THE ADOPTION OF A AYE TOOL CAPABLE OF IMPROVING PATIENT OUTCOMES.

AND EQUITY MEASURE WHICH STANDARDIZES THE LAYOFF PROCESS AND EXTENSIVE HEARING RIGHTS TO CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SO THE SAME PROTOCOLS EXIST. WILL EXIST FOR ALL SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. CERTAINLY THERE'S A DISCREPANCY IN THE WAY SCHOOLS CONDUCT LAYOFF NOTICES AS OF NOW ONLY CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES RECEIVE A LAYOFF NOTICE OR PINK SLIP. IF THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE NOTICE BY MARCH FIFTEENTH AND JOB IS PROTECTED FOR THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR FOR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ON THE OTHER HAND CAN BE LET GO AT ANY POINT IN THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH JUST A SIXTY DAY NOTICE. MOREOVER CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO CONTEST THEIR LEG OFF THE A HEARING PROCESS CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE NOT AFFORDED THIS RIGHT. PACIFIED WORKERS OF THE MOST DIVERSE WORKFORCE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES TO MAINTAIN SCHOOL OPERATIONS. AB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT WOULD ENSURE ALL EMPLOYEES REGARDLESS OF THEIR JOB TITLE ARE GRANTED THE SAME LAYOFF NOTICE AND WORKER PROTECTIONS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE LIBBY SPONSORS. GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ADVOCATE FOR SEIU ON THE LOTUS BUILT ON FLOTUS LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH CSEA. CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU BOTH LIBERTY SUCH AS WE UNDERSTAND YOUR TOTAL COVERAGE LINE IS SO YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD EVENING MISTER KAREN MEMBERS WOULD BE SAID ABOUT HALF OF AT THE AYE YOU CALIFORNIA PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE. THE BILL SEEKS TO RECTIFY ONE ELEMENT OF THE DRAMATIC DISPARITY IN THE UNFAIR AND IMBALANCED DYNAMIC BETWEEN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS AND THEIR EMPLOYERS. ENDEMIC BROUGHT OUT THE HEROES AMONG US NONE OF THEM WERE KATE BUT MANY OF WHOM WERE ONE LADY HERE THAT BUS DRIVER UNIFORMS OR SPECIAL ED. AIDE LANYARDS THESE ARE CLASSIFIED WORKERS HE DIDN'T MISS A BEAT TO THE DETRIMENT OF. THE DOCUMENT OF THEIR OWN HEALTH AND SAFETY TO ENSURE THAT KIDS WHO RELY ON FREE AND REDUCED BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FOR THEIR VERY SURVIVAL BUT- EACH AND EVERY DAY DURING THE THAT MAC. AS A PARENT I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY EMAIL NOTICE THAT I RECEIVED FOR THE PAST SIXTEEN MONTHS. FROM THE FACT TO BE UNIFIED NOTIFYING ME OF ANOTHER INCIDENT THIS COLD ED AMONG CLASSIFIED FOOD SERVICE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE TOO MANY OF THOSE NOTICES THE COUNT THOSE HEROES AMONG US KEPT ON DOING THEIR JOBS AND NOT JUST WHAT CLASSIFIED STOCKDALE THEY ARE THE VERY GLUE THAT KEEPS OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TOGETHER. ESPECIALLY IN TIMES LIKE THESE BUT IT IS ALSO ONE HUNDRED LIKE THESE THAT THEIR LACK OF JOB SECURITY AND UNEQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW BECOMES SO GLARINGLY AND OBVIOUSLY WRONG. THE OPPOSITION WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. FINALLY AND CONSISTENT NOTICE WOULD CREATE CHAOS GOLDMAN FAMILY YET NO SUCH SIMILAR CHAOS ENSUES WHEN FOLLOWING THESE PROTOCOLS FOR CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES AND ADMINISTRATORS. THE REAL CHAOS IS IN THE LIVES OF CLASSIFIED STAFF WHO CAN AS THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS IN THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTED TO MANAGE WITH SIXTY DAYS NOTICE AT ANY TIME DURING THE YEAR I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO SIXTY DAYS NOTICE AS UNDER EXISTING LAW THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS. THE OPPOSITION WOULD ALSO HAVE YOU BELIEVE IF THAT'LL LEAD IN CALL AT THE- WITH HEARING. APPEALS THE LIGHT WHAT'S IN THE GLASS NOTE THAT ONE AGAIN NOT THAT I KNOW THEY- WITH THEIR TO. THAT HAD BEEN A- SOUTH AND WARM FOR SUCH EXPAND WITH BE WITHIN THEIR- AND THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE IT WITHIN THEIR SOUL DISCRETION TO ISSUE ANY OF THE LAYOFF NOTICES THAT WOULD GIVE RIGHTS HEARINGS AND APPEALS. THIS BILL WON'T CREATE CHAOS IT WON'T WREAK HAVOC BUT IT WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO THE LIVES OF CLASSIFIED WORKERS BY ENSURING THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. WHETHER AND WHEN A LAYOFF NOTICE MIKE POMPEO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE DOORS AROUND FOR THIS IF YOU'RE ON THE TELECONFERENCE LEVINE OR PERHAPS YOU'RE HERE PRESENT. MY NOTES WEREN'T SO GREAT. THE USUALLY ARE. THANK YOU LISA MEMBERS. MY NAME IS STILL. TARANTULA I REPRESENTS YET. WITH THE SPONSORS OF AB FOUR THREE EIGHT. AB FOUR THREE EIGHT IS ABOUT EQUITY. IS ABOUT FAIRNESS AND IT'S ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING. IT'S ABOUT PROVIDING ALL SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WITH THE SAME WAY OFF NOTICING HEARING RIGHT INSTEAD OF PROVIDING ONE SET OF RULES FOR THE HIGHEST WAGE EARNERS. AND ANOTHER FOR THE LOWEST WAGE EARNERS. FOR TOO LONG DISTRICTS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET ON THE BACKS OF CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. THE LAW IS STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THIS. BUT IT IS TIME TO CHANGE THIS OUTDATED. AND UNJUST LAW. CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THEY PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES TO OUR OUR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS THEY NEVER STOPPED WORKING THEY PREPARED AND DELIVERED MEALS AND HOMEWORK TO STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING. THE CLEAN AND DISINFECT OUR CLASSROOMS AND SADLY. SOME OF MY MEMBERS PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE. YET TWO THOUSAND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF. EVEN THOUGH THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT CUT DISTRICT BUDGETS. TWO THOUSAND WERE LAID OFF EVEN THOUGH THE LEGISLATURE HAD INTENT LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET LANGUAGE THAT ESSENTIALLY SAID LAYOFF. COULD NOT OCCUR FOR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. TWO THOUSAND WERE LAID OFF. WHEN NOBODY ELSE COULD BE LAID OFF THIS IS WRONG. THE OPPOSITION WILL ARGUE THAT OUR MEMBERS SHOULD NOT GET THE SAME PROTECTIONS IS THERE MEMBERS. THAT OUR SENIORITY RULES AND PROBATIONARY PERIODS NEED TO CHANGE BUT THEY FAILED TO TELL YOU THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY STATUTORY SENIORITY RIGHTS. WE BARGAIN SENIORITY LOCALLY WITH DISTRICTS WHO AGREE WITH THEM. THEY FAILED TO TELL YOU THAT THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES IN FACT WE AMENDED THE BILL TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AT THE REQUEST. THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THE LAYOFFS ARE WORSE FOR HIGHER PAID EMPLOYEES THAN THEY ARE FOR LOWER PAID EMPLOYEES BUT I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THE PAIN OF A LAYOFF IS JUST AS. SIGNIFICANT FOR LOWER WAGE EMPLOYEES. THERE SOME THE SAME. MY MEMBERS ARE NOT ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT THEY'RE ASKING FOR THE SAME TREATMENT IT'S THAT SIMPLE I ASKED MY BOAT. OKAY THINK HER TESTIMONY IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TECH SUPPORT POSITION. ON THIS BILL. C. KNOWN ELSE COME FORWARD WILL CHECK YOUR FULL ROOM. THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO TESTIFY. MODERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE QUEUE UP A POSSIBLE. HELLO SUPPORT WITNESSES ON A BEFORE THIRTY A PLACE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO.

HI MISTER TAYLOR YOU-MAY PROCEED- I KNOW WE HAVE CHRIS REEF WHO'S GOING TO FOLLOW YOU BUT YOU MAY PROCEED NOW. ATTEMPT. TO PARDEE MATURE THIS IS CHRIS FREE FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION I BELIEVE TIM IS. UNABLE TO MAKE IT DUE TO A FAMILY EMERGENCY SO I'LL BE DOING ONE SPEAKING. AT THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION OKAY THAT'S FINE THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT YOU MAY PROCEED NORTH. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. MEGHAN TO THE QUEEN NUMBER THE WALLED CITY UP TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY. I'M CRITICAL CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL BUT STRONG OPPOSITION TO IT BEFORE THIRTY EIGHT. I WANT TO FIRST THANK YOU AUTHOR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US IN THE BILL. UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN OPPOSED- BECAUSE IT STRIKES AT THE HEART PUBLICLY INFORMED. DECISION MAKING AND RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS TO MAKE. NECESSARY BUDGET BUDGETARY DECISION. IN DOING THE BILL ELIMINATES BIG SIX DELAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT FOR CLASSIFIED STAFF AND REPLACES THAT BY ALIGNING NOTICING REQUIREMENTS WITH THE MARKET YOU KNOW IT'S DEADLINE. FOR TEACHERS. WOULD ALSO HAND CUFF FUTURE LEGISLATURES BY MANDATING THAT ANY FUTURE NOTICING RIGHT PROVIDED TO TEACHERS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY EXTEND THE CLASSIFIED THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE RIGHT. OR APPROPRIATE OR BENEFICIAL TO CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE. RECOGNIZING THAT STAFF SALARIES AND BENEFITS MAKE UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGET. AMOUNTING TO AS MUCH AS NINETY PERCENT. IF ADOPTED EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ACT UPON YOUR THE AND THE ENTIRETY OF ITS BUDGET A FULL THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE STATE BUDGET IS ADOPTED. AND NEARLY SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO DISTRICT MAKING INFORMED BUDGETARY PROVISION BASED UPON IT UP AT THE BUDGET. YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICT OPERATE AT THE MERCY OF THE STATE BUDGET AND MARCH FIFTEENTH DEADLINE CAN COME THE TIME. WHEN WE ONLY KNOW WHAT THE PROPOSED BUDGET LOOKS LIKE. CHOIRS DISTRICT TO PREDICT WHAT THEIR BUDGET WILL BE BASED UPON. USING THE PROPOSED JANUARY BUDGET WHICH DURING DOWN BUT YEARS CAN BE DRACONIAN AND BOTH FUNDING CUTS. AS SUCH THE FOR MARCH FIFTEENTH REQUIREMENT FORCES DISTRICTS TO ACT UPON THE REALITY OF THE JANUARY BUDGET AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THE BUDGET WILL BE A JOB ALIVE PERSON. OKAY THIS IS NOT REGULATION THIS IS WHAT DISTRICTS HAVE REGULARLY EXPERIENCED DURING BUT DOWN BUDGET YEARS IN THE PAST DURING BOTH THE DOT COM RECESSION AND THE GREAT RECESSION RECESSION SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE FORCED OVER NOTICE TEACHERS DO THE MARCH FIFTEENTH REQUIREMENTS. IF ADOPTED BUT WE FEAR AND WE KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL RESULT IN THE OVERNIGHT THING OF CLOCK RIGHT BACK. IT ALSO BE NOTED THAT ELIMINATING THAT DAY LAYOFF NOTICE IN REQUIREMENT REMOVES THE ABILITY OF DISTRICTS TO AVOID OVER NOTHING. CURRENTLY THE SIXTY DAY NOTICE IS ONE THAT ALLOWS MANEUVERABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE PERSONAL DECISIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WHEN WE KNOW WHAT THE BUDGET IS AND IS NOT ADEQUATE TO SPECULATION AT THE HARD DEADLINE OF MARCH FIFTEENTH. GIVE ME CIRCUMSTANCES WE BELIEVE NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO MAKE CHANGES OF THIS SCALE TO THE EMPLOYMENT PROCESS THAT OUR FOCUS SHOULD REMAIN ON HOW WE CAN CONTINUE. TO BEST SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF. IN A CONSTANTLY SHIFTING ENVIRONMENT. YOUR TIME. BUT EVEN THREE STRONGLY URGE OUR NOBLE. THANK YOU.

CERTIFIED EMPLOYEE SHOULD NOT- THIS IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE MEASURE I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT HIM HAPPY. TO MOVE THE BILL IN THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. THANK YOU SIR NEWMAN. I THINK. MEMBERS SURE DID YOU WANT TO FOR A CENTER WHERE I HAD A FALL SHE ALREADY DEFERRED TO YOU SOONER OKAY. AND SHE'S. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND IT'S I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE EQUITY ISSUE HERE I SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR. AND THE ONE I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE THE FIRST TIME AROUND. WE WERE RUNNING DEFICITS WHO WERE HAVING A ROUGH TIME FUNDING THE SCHOOLS. AND SO BECAUSE THIS REQUIREMENT EXISTED FOR CERTIFICATED PERSONALS. OF THE DEFAULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WAS TO SEND OUT LAYOFF NOTICES TO JUST HUNDREDS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND THEN IF THEY GOT THE BUDGET ALLOCATION IN THE SPRING TO RESEND THEM I GOT TO BE THIS. RIO DYSFUNCTIONAL SITUATION WHERE. IT JUST ACROSS THE STATE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE GETTING LAYOFF NOTICES AND THEN THEY WERE RESCINDED ARM MAYBE THE SNARKY WAY TO ASK THE QUESTION IS IN THE INTEREST OF EQUITY ARE WE EXTENDING A DYSFUNCTIONAL SYSTEM TO EVERYONE. A. M. THE THING ABOUT IT IS I'M FOR THE EQUITY IN THE SITUATION I GET THAT COMPLETELY BUT YOU WEREN'T GOOD TIMES WE JUST HAD THE BEST EDUCATION BUDGET THAT WE'VE HAD. MODERN TIMES THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE HORIZON BUT IF WE WERE TO HAVE AN EQUAL CHECKING OF THE EDUCATION BUDGET WHAT'S TO KEEP THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM DOING THE SAME THING OF JUST. ISSUING 15% OF THEIR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES LAYOFF NOTICES AND THEN RESCINDED. MOST OF THEM WHEN THEY GET TO JULY. I REMEMBER THE TIMES WHEN OURS ARE CERTIFICATED OUR TEACHERS RECEIVE THOSE PINK SLIPS AS WE CALL THEM YEAH AND YOU'RE RIGHT- IT'S VERY UNNERVING. BUT AS- THE SAME AS DURING THAT TIME THE SAME THING WOULD HAPPEN KNOWN AS I TOLD THE STAKEHOLDERS MY MOTHER CALLS IT A HOSTESS WHENEVER THERE'S A CHANGE THERE WILL BE CHANGE IN THE LAW. THERE HAVE TO BE ADJUSTMENTS SO INITIALLY MAKE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO OVER. NOT NOTIFY THE CLASSIFIED BUT THE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE AND THEY WILL MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHO THEY SENT THE NOTICES TO JUST AS THEY DO WITH THE CERTIFICATED IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EVERYBODY THE GET SET. AND EVEN IF IN THE END IT THERE THE YEAH THEY THEY DON'T SEND THE NOTICES OUT. IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT PROVIDE AT LEAST A 2% COLA INCREASE THE DISTRICTS CAN THEN SEND OUT A NOTICE IF THEY DIDN'T DO BEFORE MARCH FIFTEENTH. THERE ARE WAYS TO DEAL WITH THIS BUT IN THE END. WE SHOULD NOT BE BALANCING THE BUDGET ON THE BACKS OF THE CLASSIFIED. EVERYBODY SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS IMPORTANT TO THE TEACHING. AND TO BE EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS. N. I. GET THAT. A. N. IT'S WHY I THINK N THE END I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. A BECAUSE OF THAT EQUITY IN IT AND IT WAS CLEAR IN MY OWN SITUATION THE CLASSIFIED. EMPLOYEES BORE THE BRUNT OF SOME OF THE HARDEST WORK WHETHER IT WAS. YOU KNOW JUST IN THE PAPER WORK WITH REGARD TO ENROLLMENT FOR GRADES OR- R. OR THE MORE TRADITIONAL THINGS OF DRIVING BUSES OR OR DOING OTHER STUFF. THE END IS THERE THE FLEXIBILITY ALSO THE ONE DIFFERENCE LAWS. IS WITH THE CERTIFICATED PERSONNEL THAT AFFECTS SCHOOL YEAR. AND IT WAS ALWAYS CLEAR. THAT YOU ARE NOT MONEY TO FUND THE TEACHERS FOR THE WHOLE YEAR OR NOT. BUT THEN ON THE CERTIFICATED SIDE SOME THINGS WERE EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IF YOU WERE IN SESSION GOOD SCHOOL BUSES FOR THE SECTION IF YOU WERE IN SESSION YOU NEEDED GREAT SUPPORT. BUT THERE WERE OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT GO PARTWAY THROUGH THE YEAR. THIS IS ALLOW FOR THE FLEXIBILITY OF SOMEBODY IS GRANT FUNDED OR SOMETHING THAT. IT GOES WITH THE LIFE OF THE GRANT. I'M LOOKING FOR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE I THINK THAT IF THERE STILL ISN'T AN ISSUE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. OUR THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN LOOK AT THAT. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING AN EXTRA BURDEN ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH SO MANY OTHER THINGS IN YOUR RIGHT. THIS IS BEEN A REALLY GOOD YEAR FOR ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE THIS WAY. IS THAT. WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE OFF A LAYOFF NOTICE GIVE A LAYOFF NOTICE. SHOULD EVERYBODY RECEIVE IT EQUALLY OR SHOULD IT ONLY BE THE CERTIFICATED. AND CLASSIFIED TO BE LEFT TO WONDER WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE OING TO BE LAID OFF WITHOUT HAVING THE DECENCY OF LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THEY MAY ALSO BE LAID OFF DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO BE LAID OFF BUT THEY MAY ALSO BE LAID OFF. IT'S JUST A NOTICE AND IF THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE NOTICE THEY KNOW THEIR JOB IS SECURE. BUT THEY'RE STILL THE IF THESE ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE BY THE STAKEHOLDERS IS THAT WHAT IF THE BUDGET DOESN'T PROVIDE ALL THE MONEY WELL IF IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THAT 2% COLA. THE DISTRICT CAN STILL GIVE NOTICE AFTER MARCH FIFTEENTH. OKAY THANK YOU ARE PER SHIRT- RISA AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE WORKING IF. IF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF MERGERS THIS BILL MOVES ON. THE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. WILL BUTCHER. PALLETIZED THE QUESTION- THAT HAS IMPOSED AND SAYS STATES HERE- ONE ISSUE THAT I'VE HEARD FROM MY SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THAT THE TIMING OF PROVIDING ALL PRELIMINARY LAYOFF NOTICES TO EMPLOYEES ON MARCH FIFTEENTH TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF. AND THIS WOULD CREATE. ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MOVING THE TIMELINE FOR CLASSIFIED NOTICES BACKED BY A FEW MONTHS- TO BETTER ALIGN THE LAYOFF NOTICE PROCESS WITH THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS. IN THE PM AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS DID ADDRESS WITH US. WORK BEGAN TALKING ABOUT EQUITY FOR GOING TO GET THE NOTICE THEY ALREADY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THEIR BUDGET IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AND IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED THEN THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE COLA INCREASE WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN USE A LATER DATE. THE DISTRICTS FRANKLY DID NOT LIKE GIVING THE MARCH FIFTEENTH NOTICE TO THIS TO THE CERTIFICATED EITHER. FOR THE SAME REASON BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET. THEY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THE BUDGET IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE WE'RE SAYING THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES JOBS WILL BE PROTECTED. THROUGH THE SCHOOL YEAR. PARENTS WERE SAYING SAME THINGS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES. IF WE CHANGE THE DATE THEY'RE SAYING AS I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. BUT KEEP THE MARCH FIFTEENTH FOR THE CERTIFICATED FOR THE ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS. BUT FOR THE CLASSIFIED LET'S PICK A DATE IN JUNE OR JULY. THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A ONE DATE SO THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS ABLE TO LOOK AT THEIR ENTIRE BUDGET. AND DETERMINE WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF THE LAYOFFS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO AND THEN SEND OUT THE PROPER NOTICES. IT IS THINKING. AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OPPOSITION IT'S THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPPOSING IT'S NOT THE EMPLOYEES IT'S NOT THE CERTIFICATED TO THE CSEA MEMBERS IT'S NOT CTA. IT IS THE ADMINISTRATORS AND  RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A DISTRICTS THEY HAVE TO MAKE AGAIN LOS A HOSTESS THE ADJUSTMENTS. ONCE THEY RECOGNIZE WHAT THE LAWYERS THEY WILL MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS AND I KNOW THEY WILL MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS AND SEND THE PROPER NOTICES TO THE PROPER NUMBER OF CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES JUST AS THEY DO TO THE CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES. OKAY THANK YOU- LET ME JUST. SAY FIRST ONE. FULL DISCLOSURE I'M ALSO A CO AUTHOR ON THE BILL PUT IT APPRECIATE THINK THIS IS LONG OVERDUE AND I THINK IF THERE WAS A TIME TO DO IT THIS WOULD BE THE TIME NOT TO SAY THAT IT RESOLVES ALL THE ISSUES AND I THINK YOU CALL THAT OUT OF THINGS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THING SIMILAR DISCUSS CALL THAT OUT HE DID. IT BRING SIMPLY BRINGS PARITY. BUT WE GOT THE SYSTEM THAT. TWENTY NINE FIVE ICE SPOKE TO. SPONSORS OF THE BILL IN IN IN OTHERS. TO TRY TO GET TO THE PROBABLY IN WHAT IT WE JUST HANDLE THE REST OF THIS IF WE CAN YOU KNOW AND TRY TO GET THINGS LINED UP SO YOU DON'T HAVE A MAY REVISE COMING OUT THAT EVERYBODY'S ON PINS AND NEEDLES ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER THE LEAD OFF TO THE RACES ARE DUE AND THEN. ENOUGH TO SCARE THE HELL OUT OF PEOPLE YOU GOT TO TURN AROUND IN MANY CASES AND CERTAINLY SOME OF THOSE LAYOFFS DECK PUT IN ON OFFENSE SO MANY DISTRICTS AND SO MANY YEARS CERTAINLY IN THE YEARS I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. AND MINISTERS CAME BACK AND SAID YOU KNOW THEY DON'T SAY IT THIS WAY BUT HISTORY JUST KIDDING WE DON'T REALLY HAVE TO DO THAT NOW WILL BY THAT TIME YOU'VE LOST EMPLOYEES- YOU'VE PEOPLE BEEN SCARED FOR ESPECIALLY IN TOUGH TIMES TOUGHER TIMES THAT WE'RE IN NOW. SO I THINK THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA I DON'T THINK EVERYONE WAS IN A POSITION TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW I THINK THIS BILL IT'S ENOUGH DEFINITELY DOES SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF A HUGE STEP FORWARD SAYING WILL BEFORE WE ADDRESS ANY OTHER ISSUES HERE LET'S GET TO PARITY FIRST AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW WE DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE FALL OUT. OF THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR SO MANY YEARS IN TERMS OF HARDSHIP ON EMPLOYEES IN ADMINISTRATORS AND SCHOOL BOARDS. AND SCHOOL BOARDS HATE TO MAKE THAT DECISION- NO THAT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY MAY NOT YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT HAVE TO KEEP TOSE PINK SLIPS OUT THERE- HE IS REALLY A TRIPLE NO WIN AT THIS POINT BUT BUT IT LEASES BRINGS PARITY AND I DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE YOUR BILL I THINK THE BILL'S GREAT BUT I THINK THIS IS THE NEXT STEP TOWARD TRYING TO GET TO A GREATER SOLUTION AT SOME POINT SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING OF FOREIGN- IN. WE HAVE NO OTHER REQUEST TO BE RECOGNISED HERE ON THE DATA SO- I DON'T BELIEVE CENTER DRAWS OR YOU. READY TO GO OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE REALLY RECOGNIZED- I THINK SENATOR ROSE IS TRYING TO MOVE THE BILL. SHE'S SHE'S MOVING THE MOVING THE BILL BUT ON YOUR WALKING CLOSER.

AND YOU KNOW AS AS AS WE ALL KNOW WE ARE ALL OUT WELL WHERE IS. HAS CALIFORNIANS THAT WE LIVE IN A HIGHLY VULNERABLE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE FREQUENT FLOODING DROUGHTS. ALWAYS ON ALERT FOR THE NEXT BIG EARTHQUAKE OR AT LEAST WE ARE ON THE CENTRAL COAST IN THE MONTEREY BAY- BUT WE YOU KNOW OF. OF COURSE HERE ON. CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES ARE ALWAYS AT HIGH RISK. SO THIS LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY THREE SIX TO BUILD ON CAL OSHA STANDARD FOR PROTECTING FARMING AGRICULTURAL WORKERS FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE AN UNHEALTHY QUALITY AIR CONDITIONS- LAST YEAR THE COMBINATION OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THE- PRESIDENT NUMBER OF WILDFIRES WE EXPERIENCE TO PUT ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE AVAILABILITY OF PP AND MADE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR AGRICULTURAL PLAYERS TO PROCURE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF THE RECOMMENDED AND NINETY FIVE MASKS FOR THEIR WORKERS SO THIS pFIRST IT WOULD ENSURE THE STATE'S STOCKPILE AND NINETY FIVE MASKS. WILL BE UTILIZED AND MADE AVAILABLE FOR FARMING AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. YOU SECOND IT PROVIDES CAL OSHA WITH THE DISCRETION TO DECIDE TO DEPLOY WILDFIRE STRIKE TEAMS TO AGRICULTURAL REGIONS IN WORKPLACES DURING MAJOR ON HOW THE AIR QUALITY EVENTS. AND THEN FINALLY THIRD IT WOULD REQUIRE A CULTURE TO PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT WILDFIRE SMOKE SAFETY EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND TRAINING FOR ALL FARMING AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. CALIFORNIA'S RECENT WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE ON RECORD- AND THE SMOKE FROM THESE FIRES IS EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT TINY PARTICLES RELEASED IN WILDFIRE SMOKEARE FACT UP TO TEN TIMES TEN TIMES MORE HARMFUL TO HUMANS THAN PARTICLES RELEASE FROM OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS EXHAUST FROM CARS AND FACTORIES OR FROM POWER PLANTS. AS THE NUMBER OF UNHEALTHY AIR QUALITY DAYS CONTINUE TO INCREASE ANNUALLY HERE IN OUR FIRST IN THE NATION AGRICULTURAL PRODUCING STATE WE CAN'T STAND FOR A PHARMACOLOGIC WORKERS TO RISK THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY GOING TO THE FIELD TO HARVEST. THE FOOD THAT WILL BE AND ARE DEPENDENT ON.

THEY WERE NOT JUST ESSENTIAL LABOR FORCE THEY BECAME A SACRIFICIAL LABOR FORCE. TODAY WE LIVE IN THE HISTORICAL PERIOD WHERE WE ARE EXPERIENCING AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN WILDFIRE FREQUENCY. WITH AN INTENSITY COSTS AND DAMAGES ON THE MAGNITUDE NOT SEEN BEFORE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS BEING REPORTED FOR EXAMPLE THAT IMMATURE COMEDY. AB ONE CENTURY FIRE AVERAGE WITH SEVEN POINT THREE FIVE PER YEAR. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THEY HAD SIXTY NINE FIRES IN THAT ONE YEAR ALONE. THE FARMWORKERS FACED A SITUATION TODAY WHERE THE WILDFIRE SMOKE INHALATION IS INEVITABLE WHEN THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE WORKING BEING EXPOSED TO HEAVY SMOKE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PROTECTION. THIS IS BRING IN A GREATER NUMBER OF HEALTH RISKS FOR FARMWORKERS THE CHEMICALS POLLEN SMOKE. GET DEPOSITED IN SOIL AND WATER ALSO.

BALLOT THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS WELL- FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP US MAKE A STRONGER AND BETTER BILL. AND HIGH DO APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT ITS MEMBERS TAKEN TO- CONVERSE WITH ME ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. MISTAKE BECAUSE THE COMMITTEES TIME VERY SIMPLY. THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BANK THOSE WHO ARE UNBANKED. OR UNDERBANKED SO THAT WE CREATE. A BANKING SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR NO FEES NO PENALTIES NO OVERDRAFT COSTS WE'VE NOW SEEN. BY THE EXTRAORDINARY PROFIT- ON BEHALF OF BIG BANKS WHEN IT COMES TO OVERDRAFT FEES. AND I'VE OFTEN SAID WE GOT INTO THIS WELL THE REASON WE GOT INTO THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE OF EQUITY. BECAUSE WHEN A RICH PERSON MAKES MONEY. THAT MONEY MAKES MONEY FOR THEM WHEN SOMEBODY LOW OF LOW INCOME WHO IS A LOW WAGE EARNER MAKES MONEY. THAT DOLLARS GOUGED AT EVERY CORNER AND I'LL GIVE THE EXPERIENCE FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF HE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THAT I REPRESENT. WHEN AT PAYCHECK IS EARNED EVEN IF FIFTEEN BUCKS AN HOUR. IF YOU GO TO- IF YOU GO TO YOUR LIQUOR STORE YOU GO TO PAYDAY CASH TO GO TO ANY OTHER PLACE THAT DOLLAR IS CONTINUOUSLY GAS UP FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR TODAY IS TO MOVE- IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL THIS COMMITTEE. IS TO CREATE WHAT WE CALL CALVET. BECAUSE WITH IT WHAT THIS WOULD ENTAIL AND I'LL GIVE YOU BIG PICTURE IN AN ACTUAL MECHANICS. HOW IT HOW IT WOULD WORK WE ARE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH. A PLATFORM THAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE WERE UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED WHICH IS IT WOULD. IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO INVEST- IN OTHER WORDS DEPOSIT THEIR DOLLARS- THAT PLATFORM- WOULDN'T AND THOSE DOGS WOULD BE MANAGED. BY A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION- IF THAT IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL WHICH WOULD CREATE NO FEES- NO. COST NO PENALTIES NOW IF WHEN WE GET THERE WILL BE A BIT WHAT WE- INSIDE IN THE BILL THAT WE- A- MARK ANALYSIS. THIS MARKET AND NOW- WHAT'S- WOULD DO ONE OF TWO THINGS. OR THREE THINGS. ONE IT WILL TELL US THAT WHAT IF WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS ACCURATE. HI THAT WE THAT WE WOULD COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE- BEFORE THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES AND ASKED FOR THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD- A PROCEED. IF WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS NOT ACCURATE- THEN THE SUCH AS ME BUT DOES NO WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROCEED- WITH A BANK CAL THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT. HOWEVER ALSO WE COULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO US AND SAY THIS IS THIS IS A- THESE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS PUT FORTH WE'D BE ABLE TO CHANGE SOMETHING ONLINE SO VERY SIMPLE.

YES SIR- IT IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE AT FIRST I WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE SENATE SEAT THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES I WAS ASKED ABOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE WAS REAL INTEREST ON THE CENTRAL COAST IN. IN HAVING A PUBLIC BANK AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE STEPS WERE HI SALUTE THE AUTHOR FOR SCALING BACK IN THE SENSE THAT THIS IS A MARKET ANALYSIS AND THIS REALLY MAKES THE CASE IN OUTLINES THE PROBLEMS AND- HE IS FORTY YEARS AGO I WAS PART OF A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE. THAT HAD A SIMILAR ASPIRATION AND SO WE FROM THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CREDIT UNION AND NOW THERE'S I THINK THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEMBERS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS TO DO CENTS CREDIT TO PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE IT IT'S ONE PERSON ONE VOTE SO IT'S NOT MERGING AND MOVING OUT OF THE AREA IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS TRULY COMMUNITY BASED AND BEEN PART OF IT I THINK IT'S IN THAT SPIRIT. THAT THERE IS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS SO I THINK IT'S REALLY APPROPRIATE TO GIVE THE AUTHOR A CHANCE TO MAKE THIS WORK HE'S TRYING TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT HAS A MARKET ANALYSIS AND AT THE RIGHT TIME ALL BE. HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. FOR ANYBODY ELSE THE NEWMAN. AT THANK YOU MISTRESS OR JUST WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF SENATOR- ANDERSON WOMEN I WANT TO COMMEND YOU I WAS I WAS COMPLIMENTING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ EARLIER FOR THE LENGTH OF HER SUPPORT LIST. I THINK YOU FIFTY THREE EXCEEDED. THAT AND ALL TIME RECORD IN MY EXPERIENCE WAS REALLY IMPRESSIVE BUT- ALL KIDDING ASIDE I DO APPRECIATE WE'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK THERE IS. A TREMENDOUS NEED NOT JUST JUST TO GIVE. OUR LOW WAGE CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS BUT CONFIDENCE. IN THEIR ABILITY TO SAVE- SHOULD LEAD TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISH TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME AMENABLE SURE. HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND REACHING OUT AND- TRYING TO SUGGEST ANY OF THE CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE INDIVIDUATED PRECIADO THAT EFFORT- DID I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY HERE THAT THE STUDY WOULD COST ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS. THE I DON'T THINK WE PRICE TAG TO STUDY- BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME RESOURCES TO DO BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT ALLOWS US TO DO THE MARKET ANALYSIS THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD EITHER TELL US THAT WERE ACCURATE OR NOT ACCURATE- AND WE WERE SUGGESTING THE- THAT BANK CAL WILL DO. THE STUDY TO START OVER- THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE. WITH THIS- WOULD BE- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS JUST FOR THE STUDY ON THIS RIGHT. BUT THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BILL MEANT MANSA RESEARCHER I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS ISSUE IS ABOUT. ITS CUSTOMER IN OUR HOUSE TO ASK THE TEARS ABILITY BECAUSE- PRECIADO- BLOOD IS A COUPLE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE BILL HAN MAN MY PLEASURE- THERE IS A MARKET ANALYSIS- AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE BILL SO IF THE MARKET ANALYSIS- WHICH- WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER WE ARE ACCURATE. NOT ACTORS OR MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO THE PROCESS. WILL COME BACK BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE THEM WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY- TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO PROCEED FORWARD. AT THE TIME AND IF IT DOES PROCEED FORWARD AND WE WOULD BE ABLE TO AND THEN ENACT- BANK CAL AS I MENTIONED. SEVEN AS YOU- DRESSING THE ISSUE OF THE BANKING- PROBLEM THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR MANY EVERITT AND SHE LEVEL WAGE EARNERS. HOW DO OUR COMMUNITY BANKS- FIT INTO THAT SCHEME AND UNDERSTANDING. AND I'M GLAD YOU ASKED A QUESTION BECAUSE IN MY CLOSING THOSE GAPS IN THE IN THE SAME SPIRIT THAT MY COLLEAGUE IN NORTHERN CAPE- MY CENTER IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MENTION THE SAME REASON CHINESE WHAT COMMUNITY BANKS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB. AS HAVE CREDIT UNIONS AND I SAID THAT IN EVERY SPEECH EVERYWHERE THIS PROVIDES ONE OTHER ALTERNATIVE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED TO HAVE THE ABILITY- TO GO TO THIS PLATFORM AND THE BANK AND YOU LOOK A WOOD I CAN'T SUGGEST TO BURKE YOU KNOW WHO DOES THE- BUT LOW WHO TORTURES- THE WORK BUT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY- TO COMPETE FOR THE WORK TO BE ABLE TO THE BUT THE- THE BACK IN FINANCIAL SERVICES SO THEY FIT RIGHT IN. INTO THE MISSION AND THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO BANK THOSE WERE BANKED AND UNDERBANKED- BOTH COMMUNITY BANKS. CREDIT UNIONS AND- WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO DO HERE WITH BANK- BANK CAL. SEVEN MY SHORT PERIOD OF BEING IN THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU. PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW OF ONLY BEEN HERE FOR FIVE SIX MONTHS OF BELIEVE HAVE. FAMOUS THE CHANNEL FOR SIX MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS- I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SIT ON THE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS- COMMITTEE AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS I'VE SEEN- MIND YOU I BELIEVE IN SMALL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE SAVE I SEE THE ISSUES THAT HAPPEN WHEN WE JUST BECOME BIGGER AND BIGGER- AS FAR AS NOT BE ABLE TO BE- EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO BANKING- COMPONENT SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS AND THIS IS WHY I WAS ASKING ABOUT COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS IS THAT I TRULY APPRECIATE THIS EFFORT IN THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY- REASON BEING IS THAT BECAUSE OF. JUST MY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BEING HERE SEEING HOW WE- HAVE HAD SUCH ISSUES WITH BOTH ADMINISTRATIVELY AND FINANCIALLY BE ABLE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IS A STATE A STATE AGENCIES I HAVE SEVERE CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING THE STATE COME UP WITH A BANKING SOLUTION OR BANKING MODEL FOR OUR STATE. AND THIS IS WHERE I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT- PRIVATE INDUSTRY HAVE COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN CONDUCTING THAT AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COMING TOGETHER AND CREATING PRIVATE BANKS IN THESE COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE ADEQUATE UNBANKED HER UNDERSERVED AND THAT NOTION AND I WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE ADVOCATE N. IN IN TRYING TO PURSUE THAT BENNY VERSUS HAVING THE STATE COME INTO THIS SPACE WHERE- TRADITIONALLY WE HAVEN'T BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE THIS STATE AGENCIES OR BOARDS IN IN IN DOING BUSINESS SPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCES EDT JUST TO MENTION ONE ONE ASPECT ON THAT. AND THE THOUGHT THAT THE STATE WOULD COME INTO THIS SPACE MAKES IT INCREDIBLY NERVOUS- ON. THAT ENDEAVOR IN SO. I CANNOT AT THE TIME SO THE BILL BUT I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK TO SEE HOW WE COULD. WORK IN ADVOCATE IN PRIVATE SPACE- AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN IN REALLY- CREATING BANKS BECAUSE BANKS THIRTY PRIVATE ONES WE ALWAYS THINK. BIG BANKS BUT- AS I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE STERN BANKS ON A SMALLER SCALE PRIVATELY AND WORKING COMMUNITIES AND SO I WOULD BE AN ADVOCATE. ON THAT ENDEAVOR. MEMBERS SPONSOR TERROR THE TO GIVE DELAY IN CLOSER THINK WE'RE WE'VE CONCLUDED COMMITTEE COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE CONTRACT I MEAN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT MAKES A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORK IS THAT WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION- BUT IT HELPS TO MAKE IT A BETTER BILL BECAUSE I HAVE TO TRUST THE QUESTIONS IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEES- THERE WERE- TOUGH QUESTIONS REGARDING- WHETHER THIS MAKES SENSE WITH IT WAS NEEDED. AND EVEN TO SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS I MIGHT POINT OUT OF THE MARKET ANALYSIS WILL WE SAY YOU KNOW THAT IT AND SECTION SEE THAT ANNOUNCES THAT THE CAL OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNBANKED AND THE REASON FOR WHICH THEY ARE ON BANK IN THE RESULT- THAT THAT. THE SOME OF THE- INDUSTRY TO YOU SUGGESTED IS DOING IN THE IN A PROPER JOB I DON'T BELIEVE SO BUT IT MAY RESULT IN THAT BUT IT ALSO MEANS ON THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT IN THE ANSWERS WOULD BE QUESTION- CERTAINLY QUESTIONS WOULD BE ANSWERED WITH A MARKET ANALYSIS. WE TAKE A LOOK AT OTHER THINGS LIKE THE AVAILABILITY OF PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHETHER THIS WORK COULD BE DONE OR NOT- DENOUNCES OF ADVANTAGES R DISADVANTAGES COMPARED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR ALTERNATIVES SO WE LOOK TOWARDS DOING THAT BUT ALSO I WOULD SAY THAT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT ESTABLISHING. A STATEWIDE BANK- OR A DEPARTMENT RATHER A PLATFORM- THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO WORK- CAN. WE MAY DISAGREE RIGHT BUT LET BUT- CAL SAVE. IT A PLOT. THAT LOOK VERY SIMILAR LIKE THIS WHERE THERE IS A PUBLIC PLATFORM. WHERE PEOPLE CAN SAVE THEIR DOLLARS. AND THE- AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS THE BACKSIDE OF IT THAT MANAGES THE DOLLARS AND IN IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING- IN THE STEPS IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING- OPTION ACT WHICH- IS IN EFFECT- CAL BANK SO. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS THAT THERE IS A NEED AND- I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THAT WHAT I IT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- IN- IS ESTABLISHED THIS. FOR THE SAKE. OF PEOPLE NOT FOR THE SAKE OF PROFIT. AND I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR THE BIG BANKS ARE DOING THIS IN A PROVIDED SERVICES. BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S- IT'S A FOR PROFIT. AND IT'S FOR WALL STREET. AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO THAT. MUCH LIKE THE WORK OF COMMUNITY BANKS. MUCH LIKE THE WORK OF CREDIT UNIONS- WE ARE ALSO LOOKING TO ESTABLISH. THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE. TO BE BANG TO UNDERBANKED OR UNBANKED. AND WEBER WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL- TO HAVE A SYSTEM. A FINANCIAL SYSTEM THAT CHARGES NO PENALTIES. NO FEES. NO OVERDRAFT PROTECTION I'M SORRY NO OVERDRAFT FEES AND WE JUST SAW SOME OF THE BIGGEST BANKS MAKE HISTORIC AMOUNTS OF DOLLARS ON OVERDRAFT FEES. DURING THE TIME THAT PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING- INSTANCE SO WHAT I WOULD ARGUE. IS THAT THAT I WOULD CONTINUE TO WANT TO TALK TO YOU BUT IT'S VERY. VERY CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A COMPARED TO THE MISSION. THAT A BIG BANK IS TRYING TO DO. AND THEY HAD AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE'S A NECESSARY MISSION. TO COMPLEMENT THE GOOD WORK THE COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS ARE DOING TODAY. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BEFORE YOU ARE PRESENTING AB ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN- WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ACT. AND REALLY CAN'T SEE MORE THAN THAN TO RISK TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ON BEHALF OF MYSELF A MISTER TO WHO CAN PRESENT BECAUSE THE SENATE RULES ONLY ALLOWS ONE PERCENTER. BUT WHO WHO ALSO WORKED ON. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN TO ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- DIFFERENT PIECE LEGISLATION DIFFERENT WORK. BUT BUT IT CAME OUT OF NECESSITY BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL SYSTEMS ARE NOT WORKING AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE OVER AND OVER OVER. BIG BANKS NOT DOING THIS- OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THE HEART. I'M SURE THERE'S GOOD PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THEM BUT IT'S PROFIT DRIVEN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. TODAY IS ESTABLISH A DIFFERENT SORT OF BANKING SYSTEM. FOR THE INTEREST OF PEOPLE NOT PROFIT OR OR STAKEHOLDERS OR WALL STREET STAKEHOLDERS THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. AWESOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AT RESPECTFULLY LAST WHEN I BUILT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. TO SHEER PASSION FOR THE ISSUE. THE SENATOR ALSO I'M SORRY. COULD I JUST MAKE A QUICK CALL. HE GIVE. YOU KNOW THE THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE BY SOMEONE I DON'T KNOW IF IS THE AUTHOR SOMEONE ELSE I HEARD. AND THAT IS THAT. THESE FEES. ARE NOT BEING PAID BY THE WEALTHIER PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THE FEES OVER YOU KNOW OVERDRAFT ALL THESE WAYS AND- PENALTIES- TRANSACTION SERVICES ATM SERVICES ALL THAT IS BEING PAID BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LESSER MONEY. AND IT'S JUST CRAZY BUT THE MORE MONEY YOU HAVE THE LESS LIKELY IF AT ALL THAT YOU WILL EVER PAY ANY OF THESE FEES- SO WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY TRYING TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES WORK REALLY HARD EVERY SINGLE PENNY COUNTS. FIVE DOLLARS TO GET YOUR MONEY OUT OF THE BANK IS A LOT OF MONEY TIMES CYBERMAN MUCH MANY TIMES YOU DO THAT SO. THAT'S WHAT CONVINCES ME IF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WANTED TO DO THIS NOBODY WOULD GET IN THEIR WAY NOBODY WOULD GET IN THEIR WAY THEY ARE FREE TO DO THAT TODAY WITH OR WITHOUT A. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN THEY COULD DO IT THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO IT. BUT THEY WILL STAND IN THE WAY OF OTHERS TRYING TO DO IT AND I THINK THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO COME FACE TO FACE SO I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU SENATOR- APPRECIATE YOUR CLOTHES AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION FOR THE ISSUE AND- WE HAVE A PROMOTION BY SENATOR NEWMAN.
