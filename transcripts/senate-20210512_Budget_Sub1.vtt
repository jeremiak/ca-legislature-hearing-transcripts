NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.367
ONE AND IN TWO THOUSAND SO

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.703
THESE ARE- OVER TWENTY YEARS

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.538
AGO. AND THEN IN MORE RECENT

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.173
YEARS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.740
FIFTEEN THE STATE HAS BEEN

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.243
PROVIDING SOME ONGOING FUNDING-

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.846
TO IMPROVE THE LIBRARIES ACCESS

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:02.114

THE SECOND COMPONENT FOR-

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.385
DIRECT LABOR SUPPORT. I'M HERE

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:08.454
THIS COMPONENT STATUS NOTED IT

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:10.122
THAT THE FINAL- I'M NOT A

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.923
FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.757
LIBRARIES IS STILL BEING

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:12.959
DETERMINED THEY'LL BE FINALIZED

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:14.861
AFTER THE REVISION. OF WHAT THE

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:15.928
IDEA HERE IS THAT THE FUNDING

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.563
WOULD GO TO LOCAL LIBRARIES

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.365

GENERAL OPERATIONS. AS A

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:22.568
CONDITION OF RECEIVING THESE

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.070
FUNDS LIBRARIES WOULD BE

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.272
REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE- THEIR

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.374
EXISTING POLICIES ENACTED.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.910
FINES AND FEES ON PATRONS WHO-

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:34.080
RETURN THEIR LIBRARY MATERIALS

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.481
AND BOOKS LATE. I CAN HEAR FOR

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:37.917
CONTEXT HISTORICALLY THE STATE

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.118
HAS PROVIDED SUPPORT TO LOCAL

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.286
LIBRARIES THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:40.987

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.390
YEAR AGENDA. ALL THE FIRST

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.424
PROGRAM IS THE CALIFORNIA

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.059
LIBRARY SERVICES ACT THAT

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:49.328
PROGRAM FOCUSES. ON RESOURCE

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.897
SHARING SO IT SUPPORTS

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:51.731
ACTIVITIES LIKE INTERLIBRARY

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.733
LOANS AND ACQUISITION OF WHAT

BY SAYING THAT I APPRECIATE-

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:41.814
SENTENCE BUDGET PLAN. I THINK

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:50.022
BY FROM ANY OBJECTIVE MEASURE-

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.725
THERE'S A LOT OF THE ONGOING

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.294
BENEFIT OF ONE TIME MONEY IS

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.263
INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.900
INVESTING AND- THE SOCIAL AND

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:03.369
PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.871
TO GROW RESPONSIBLY AND SUCCEED

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:09.809
ECONOMICALLY. SO- BUT WITH THAT

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:13.479
SAID- GOOD GOOD LIBRARIES HAVE

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:14.080
TWO BILLION DOLLARS INSTEAD OF

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:19.752
ONE BILLION DOLLARS- I JUST

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:21.754
THINKING BACK ON WHAT JASON

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:26.258
SAID- AT THE REQUEST OF THE

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:27.760
RESEARCH BEAR WENT OUT IN APRIL

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:29.595
AND DID A SURVEY OF LIBRARIES

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.964
AND IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:34.100
WE GOT AN ESTIMATE FOR THE

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.169
RENOVATION- RECONSTRUCTION-

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.538
REHABILITATION NEEDS OF ABOUT

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:41.574
70% OF THE LIBRARY FACILITIES

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.576
IN THE STATE. AND THAT'S ABOUT

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:44.643
THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.645
DOLLARS OF WHICH THREE HUNDRED

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:48.180
AND FORTY FIVE MILLION IF MY

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:51.050
MEMORY SERVES- DEFERRED

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:53.352
MAINTENANCE SO FIGURE IF YOU

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.987
ADD THE OTHER ELSE THAT'S

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:57.957
MISSING 30% LET'S SAY YOU KNOW

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.225
THE TOTAL NEED IS PROBABLY

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:01.861
CLOSER TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS.

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:03.162
AND A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:05.531
STRUCK ME IN THE SURVEY RESULTS

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:11.837
AND- A NEED IS SOME KIND OF

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:12.972
SUMMARY TOUCHES ON THIS. IS

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.807
THAT FUNCTIONALLY A LARGE

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.442
PERCENTAGE OF LIBRARIES ARE

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.478
TWENTY YEARS OF AGE. AND BUT

00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:22.348
THAT DOESN'T. THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:23.816
THEY WERE BUILT TWENTY YEARS

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:25.384
AGO THAT MEANS THEY WERE BUILT

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.420
YOU KNOW SOMETIME AGO AND HAVE

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:29.688
BEEN REMODELED SUBSEQUENTLY SO

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:31.390
THAT FROM A QUOTA BOTH

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:32.958
FUNCTIONAL STANDPOINT THERE

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.027
TWENTY YEARS OF AGE. BUT EVEN

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:38.864
IF THERE TWENTY YEARS OF AGE-

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:40.132
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:44.136
DEFICIENCIES THAT- THE OLDER

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.038
BUILDINGS TACK RIGHT SO MANY

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.706
WERE GRANDFATHERED IN UNDER THE

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.909
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.777
IF YOU BRING A I'M TOLD IF YOU

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.846
BRING UP BATHROOM UP TO

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:57.249
COMPLIANCE- THAT CAN COST. AT

00:11:57.316 --> 00:12:00.152
LEAST ONE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.922
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE- OLDER

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:04.190
BUILDINGS AREN'T AS ENERGY

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:07.426
EFFICIENT HAS MORE MODERN BUILT.

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:10.463
AND I THINK PARTICULARLY IN

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.531
CONNECTION WITH THE SENATE AND

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.467

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.869
COMMITMENT TO. IMPROVING

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:18.671
BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY AND

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:20.639
CONNECTING CALIFORNIANS TO THE

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:23.442
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:24.610
RIGHT TRYING TO CLOSE THE

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:28.314
OPPORTUNITY GAP- AN ENORMOUS

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.549
ISSUE IS THE WIRING IN THESE

00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:31.484
OLDER BUILDINGS THAT CAN

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.352
ACCOMMODATE THE KIND OF HI

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.087
SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.857
THAT'S REQUIRED- IN OUR

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:40.359
INCREASINGLY DIGITAL AGE. AND

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.293
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT REAL

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.697
GLAMOROUS BUT TO MAKE THE

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:46.165
COMMITMENTS THAT THE

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.399
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

ARE BRINGING IN THE HIGHER

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.543
SPEED AS OPPOSED TO OLDER

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.244
BUILDINGS THAT ARE MORE LIKE

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.913
THE FINAL. AND AGAIN LIKE THE

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.481
EIGHT LIKE THE BATHROOMS UNDER

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:04.683
ABA IT'S NOT IT'S NOT CHEAP SO

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.486
WE JUST USED GRANT MONEY- TO

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:09.121

TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.832
FOOT BUILDING SINGLE STORY SO

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:20.866
IT'S NOT A TERRIBLY COMPLICATED

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:23.536
PROJECT. BUT HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:25.538
DOLLARS TO DO THE REQUIRE. AND

00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:28.774

THE STATE'S ELEVEN HUNDRED

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.346

TO START TALKING ABOUT THE

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:07.526

WHERE THAT OKAY THEN I'LL GO

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:02.875
THE SENATOR MEN. HI I WANTED TO

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:06.311
ASK- A BIT ABOUT- THE FEE

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:09.314
RELIEF AND ITS GOALS I

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:10.682
UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:12.718
PURPOSE OF THIS IS AS EQUITY

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.453
AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.787
WONDER IF WE'RE CREATING A

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:19.191
SITUATION WHERE- YOU KNOW I

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:20.893
GREW UP IN A TIME WHEN WE YOU

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.160
KNOW KNEW THAT IF WE RETURN OUR

00:19:22.227 --> 00:19:24.229
BOOKS LATE WE- ENCOURAGE THOSE

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:25.864
FEES AND THAT WAS A DETERRENT

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:27.266
TO ME RETURN THOSE BOOKS LATE

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.535
AS A KID. AS AN ADULT- AND THAT

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.036
WAS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.704
OUR LOCAL LIBRARIES KEPT

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:34.840
POPULAR BOOKS IN STOCK MAKE

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.074
SURE THAT YOU KNOW I MIGHT HAVE

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:37.442
TO WAIT A WEEK BUT I DON'T HAVE

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.076
TO WAIT A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:40.279
OR THREE MONTHS FOR. THE LATEST

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.446
COOL BOOK THAT WE ALL WANTED TO

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.048
CHECK OUT AND I WONDER IF

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.149
PARTICULARLY IN THOSE AREAS

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:45.951
THAT ARE CATERING TO LOWER

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:46.952
INCOME COMMUNITIES IF THIS

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:49.354
MIGHT HAVE A PERVERSE RESULT

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.757
OF- ACTUALLY CREATING MORE BOOK

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:56.194
ANSWERS- JUST BY. KIND OF

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:56.929
GETTING RID OF ANY. INCENTIVES

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.363
TO ACTUALLY. THOSE BOOKS ON

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.133
TIME. IN I GUESS A BIG MIKE MY

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:02.067
QUESTION IS COULD WE DO THIS

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:03.735
MORE TAILORED. IF THE GOAL IS

00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:04.903
TO PROVIDE TARGETED RELIEF

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.872
COULD WE JUST TARGET. A CERTAIN

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.206
HOUSEHOLDS AND COMMUNITIES AND

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:09.908
PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RELIEF.

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:11.376
RATHER THAN A BLANKET POLICY

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.478
THAT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO SOME

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.347
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- AND

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.316
I'M NOT SURE THAT QUESTIONS FOR

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:21.219
BUT- PROBABLY ANY OF THEM. I

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:21.820
GUESS THIS IS A MORAL HAZARD

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:22.754
QUESTION AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:25.157
IT LOOKS LIKE MR LUCAS'S

00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:26.925
PREPARED TO PLUNGE INTO THE

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:30.829
MORAL HAZARD TERRITORY. I SEE.

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:37.302
I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT I AM-

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:39.438
WELL I THINK CERTAINLY THAT YOU

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:40.872
KNOW ABOUT THE PROPOSAL COULD

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:43.275
BE MORE NARROWLY TAILORED THE

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:49.648
EXPERIENCE HAS NOT BEEN- WHAT

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:51.683
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SENATOR

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.519

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:55.921
THERE THERE BEEN A GREATER

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:58.757
NUMBER OF RETURNS OF ITEMS AND

00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:01.259
HIGHER LIBRARY USE BY

MY YOUTH RIGHT LIKE THAT WAS AN

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:12.170
INCENTIVE. THE YOU KNOW TO

HONOR THE BARGAIN THAT I'VE

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:15.040
MADE WITH THE LIBRARY THE TO

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.508

PEOPLE ARE MORE RESPONSIVE

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.755

I'M NOT FOR THAT LIBRARY

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.041

LIBRARY OF THE FUTURE- I MEAN

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:54.419
WE'RE SEEING THAT TAKING PLACE

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:55.620
IN COMMUNITIES AROUND

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:58.356
CALIFORNIA NOW SO LIBRARIES

00:25:58.423 --> 00:26:00.659
HAVE BECOME IT IT MEAN WITH

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:02.394
RESPECT TO COMMUNITY CENTERS

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.763
KIND OF WHAT COMMUNITY CENTERS

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:05.964
WISH THEY COULD. SO

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.966
INCREASINGLY LIBRARIES NOW ARE

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:10.468
TRYING TO MAKE THE SPACE INSIDE

00:26:10.535 --> 00:26:13.538
OF THEM MORE FLEXIBLE.

00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:15.941
LIBRARIES THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:17.809
THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LIBRARY

DIRECTORS IN THE LIBRARY USERS

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:21.813

STUDY ROOMS FOR COLLABORATION

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:25.150
RIGHT SO THE LIBRARY OF THE

00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:26.785
FUTURE IS A PLACE THAT THE

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:29.688

IS LIBRARIES NOW AND THIS IS

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:55.046

THE PANDEMIC WHEN PHYSICAL

00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:58.650
DOORS WERE CLOSED. LIBRARIES

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:19.677
SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN.

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:20.612
I'LL JUST WALK THROUGH IT

00:31:20.678 --> 00:31:22.814
REALLY QUICKLY IF YOU START AT

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.950
THE- TOP OF THE TABLE YOU WILL

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:27.652
SEE THE EFFORTS SIX CAMPUSES.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.220
OF THOSE CAMPUSES IT WOULD

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:30.922
REDUCE THE SHARE OF THEIR

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:32.857
FRIEND INCOMING FRESHMEN WHO

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:35.260
ARE NON RESIDENTS. HE 10% AND

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:37.161
THEY WOULD ACCOMPLISH THIS OVER

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:41.032
A ROUGHLY TEN YEAR PERIOD- THE

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:42.333
REMAINING THREE CAMPUSES THAT

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.568
HAVE SHARES THAT ARE ALREADY

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:45.236
BELOW 10% WOULD HAVE THE

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:47.405
FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE THEIR

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:48.873
SHARES TO THAT 10% ONE THAT.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.441
I'M WHICH IS WHAT'S BEING

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:52.644
DISPLAYED HERE ON THE TABLE. IF

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:53.711
YOU MOVE TO THAT MIDDLE PART OF

00:31:53.778 --> 00:31:55.947
THE TABLE. DISPLAYS THE NUMBER

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:57.415
OF FRESHMEN YOU'LL SEE THAT

00:31:57.482 --> 00:32:00.051
THE- GROWTH IN THE RESIDENT

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:02.053
FRESHMAN IS SLIGHTLY LARGER

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.755
THAN THE GROWTH FOR THE

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:04.922
REDUCTION OF NON RESIDENT. I

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:05.790
THINK AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:07.091
GROWTH IN NON RESIDENT MOMENT

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:09.260
OUT THOSE REMAINING THREE

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:12.263
CAMPUSES. AND WE'VE BEEN

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.831
WORKING WITH STAFF ON WHAT-

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:14.832
THIS PLAN MIGHT COST OUR

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:16.701
INITIAL ESTIMATE- GOING TOWARDS

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.037
THE BOTTOM OF THE- PEOPLE THERE

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:19.937
WOULD BE FIFTY SIX MILLION

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:22.540
DOLLARS. IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:26.277
AND THAT WOULD BE BOTH TO- OR

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:27.545
COVERED THE LAST REVENUE

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:28.846
ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING THE

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:31.516
NONRESIDENT MOMENT. AND ALSO TO

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:33.518
OTHER COSTS TO INCREASE

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:35.486
RESIDENT WILL MANAGE. YOU'RE

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.155
LOOKING AT THIS TABLE IT MIGHT

00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:39.657
REYES- TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:41.292
QUESTION IT MIGHT RAISES WHY IS

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.995
YOUR ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:45.129
TWENTY THREE AND NOT THE BUDGET

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:46.197
YEAR WHICH IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:47.598
TWENTY TWO. AND THE REASON FOR

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:50.401
THIS IS THAT UC HAS LARGELY

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:50.902
MADE ITS FALL ADMISSION

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:53.538
DECISIONS. FOR FALL TWENTY

00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:55.173
TWENTY ONE. AND SO YOU SEE

00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:56.541
LIKELY WOULD NEED AN ADDITIONAL

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:57.675
YEAR BEFORE CAN START

00:32:57.742 --> 00:33:00.712
IMPLEMENTING ITS PLAN TO REDUCE

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.347
NON RESIDENT MOMENT. I ALSO

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:04.082
NOTE THAT THE STATE BUDGET IN

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:04.982
RECENT YEARS HAS TAKEN A

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:06.718
SIMILAR APPROACH IS PROVIDED AN

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:08.019
ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING IN

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:09.053
THE BUDGET BUT THEN SET THE

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.788
TARGET FOR ONE YEAR LATER. FOR

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:11.789
THE EXACT SAME REASON YOU SEE

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:13.558
ALL HAS ALREADY MADE POLITICIAN

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:14.659
DECISIONS BY THE TIME THE

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.194
BUDGETS OVERSIGHT GIVEN THE

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.995
SIGNAL TO MAKE PLANS FOR THE

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:21.032
FOLLOWING YEAR. ON THE SECOND

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:23.034
QUESTION THAT THIS PLAN MIGHT

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:25.903
RAISE IS WHY IS THE RESIDENT.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.338
COST LARGER THAN THE NON

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:29.774
RESIDENT COSTS. AT LEAST IN THE

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:31.843
FIRST YEAR AND THERE ARE A FEW

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:35.446
REASONS FOR THAT- ONE REASON IS

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:38.149
THAT OUR OUR ESTIMATES INCLUDE

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:39.384
SOME PROJECTIONS AND CONTINUING

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.185
ENROLLMENT RATHER THAN JUST NEW

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:43.254
ROMANCE AND THAT. INCREASES THE

00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:45.790
GROWTH IN RESIDENT MOMENT IN

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:46.357
THE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:48.393
PLAN. THIS IS BEING DRIVEN BY

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:50.194
THE POLICY BUT IT IS A GROWTH

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.662
THAT WE PROJECT YOU SEE MAY

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:52.964
ENCOUNTER AND IT'S A COST THAT

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.833
THE- LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:56.401
AS PART OF ITS- FINAL BUDGET

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:59.103
DECISIONS. ALSO THAT RESIDENT

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.938
ROMAN NUMBER INCLUDES ON THE

00:34:01.005 --> 00:34:02.473
COST OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.574
WHEN THE STATE INCREASES

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:05.810
RESIDENT MOMENT THAT YOU SEE.

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:07.612
NOT ONLY DOES IT INCREASE.

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:08.746
COSTS ASSOCIATED HIRING MORE

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:10.882
FACULTY AND STAFF. IT ALSO

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:12.283
INCREASED COST TO THE CAL GRANT

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.451
PROGRAMS FOR THE STUDENTS WHO

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:14.786
ARE LOW INCOME AND ON THE

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:17.422
CALDERON PROGRAM. SO THOSE

00:34:17.488 --> 00:34:18.022
COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THERE AS

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:21.459
WELL. ONE FINAL THING TO NOTE

00:34:21.526 --> 00:34:23.661
IS THAT THIS IS A MULTI YEAR

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.496
PLAN SO EACH YEAR YOU SEE IS

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:26.664
CONTINUING TO INCREASE

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.933
RESIDENT. AND REDUCING NON

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.501
RESIDENT MOMENT AND SO EACH

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.403
YEAR THE COSTS ESCALATE WE

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.738
ESTIMATE THAT EVENTUALLY THE

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.540
ONGOING COSTS WOULD RISE TO

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:37.675
ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:38.242
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NOT FOR

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:39.877
FINAL YEAR GLOBALIZATION. AND

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:42.513
THEIR AFTER THAT WOULD BE THE

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.516
ONGOING COSTS OF THE PROGRAM.

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.652
THAT'S THE YOU SEE- PLAN FOR

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:49.253
CSU THE PLAN IS A LITTLE

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.354
SIMPLER SO GO THROUGH A LOT

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:51.823
QUICKER. ON THE SENATE

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.725
DEMOCRATS PLAN AIMS TO INCREASE

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:57.161
SEE IF YOU RESIDENT MOMENT- BUT

00:34:57.228 --> 00:34:58.196
WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING

00:34:58.262 --> 00:35:00.064
REDUCTION IN NON RESIDENT WOMAN

00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:01.399
AND THIS IS BECAUSE IT CSU

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:03.034
NONRESIDENT MOMENT IS ALREADY.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.603
LESS THAN 10% OF TOTAL

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.571
UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. I'M

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.272
HERE STAFF INDICATES THAT THE

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:10.007
ENROLLMENT TARGET FOR CSU HAS

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:12.310
NOT BEEN FINALIZED ON THIS WILL

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:12.844
BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.146
FINALIZED. AFTER THE REVISION.

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:18.783
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.018

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.134
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF

INTENT OF INCREASING THE NUMBER

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:44.876
IF YOU SEE DECREASED BY CLOSING

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:46.677
GRADUATION GAPS FOR LOW INCOME

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:49.013

INCREASES THE ACCESS FOR

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:53.384
CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:55.086
BECAUSE WHEN STUDENTS GRADUATE

00:35:55.152 --> 00:35:57.255
IN A TIMELY MATTER UNIVERSITY

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:58.856
CAN ADMIT MORE STUDENTS FOR THE

REQUEST THAT YOU PROVIDE

00:52:58.174 --> 00:53:00.243
RESIDENT STUDENTS. ADOPTED BY

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.913
THE UC REGENTS IN TWENTY

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:04.915
SEVENTEEN WE THINK THAT- HELPS

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:08.118
THE UNIVERSITY MAINTAIN. OUR

00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:10.854
REVENUE SOURCES AND ALSO.

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.556
ALLOWS A STATEMENT ARE

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:15.792
CONTINUALLY MORE CALIFORNIA.

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:18.061
RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES INTO

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.429
OUR SYSTEM HOW TO IS LEAVING

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:21.498
THE NUMBER HIVE OUT OF STATE

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:25.969
STUDENTS ALLOW YOU TO ADMIT

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:28.004
MORE IN STATE STUDENTS. BECAUSE

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:30.073
CURRENTLY ARE OUT OF STATE

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:34.878
STUDENTS HE AB. TWENTY NINE

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:36.613
THOUSAND DOLLAR ADDITIONAL FEE.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.816
ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE REVENUE

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:42.152
TO HIRE MORE INSTRUCTORS STAND

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:44.654
BY THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS- OUR

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:48.391
STATE FUNDING PER STUDENT HAS-

00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:49.893
DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.696
BEEN INCREASING. STATE FUNDING

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:55.098
FOR THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ARE

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.866
WE HAVE COST EXPENDITURES HAVE

00:53:56.933 --> 00:53:59.169
GROWN SO MUCH AND WE'VE TAKEN

00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:01.638
ON NEW ENROLLMENT- THAT ARE

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:02.806
DOLLARS PER STUDENT HAS

00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:04.541
ACTUALLY BEEN FALLING BUT WE

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:06.610
CAN SPEND SO RESTRICTING DOC

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:08.812
NONRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.547
TUITION REVENUE SOURCE WOULD

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.082
MEAN THAT IN A CASE OF A

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:14.017
RECESSION WE WILL HAVE LESS

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:16.219
MONEY TO FALL BACK ON IT'S

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.354
ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THE

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.888
UNIVERSITY TO ENSURE THAT WE

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:22.425
CAN MAINTAIN QUALITY DIFFICULT.

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.094
FINANCIAL TIMES. AND SO THIS

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.062
THIS TIES TOGETHER DIRECTLY

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:28.832
WITH THE FIRST SET OF QUESTIONS

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:31.701
I WAS ASKING BECAUSE IF. IT

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:35.672
SEEMS THAT THE CONTENTION IS

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:37.474
THAT HAVING OUT OF STATE

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.843
STUDENTS AT THE LEVEL THAT IT

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:42.612
IS NOW IS NOT IN ANY WAY

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:44.981
DISADVANTAGING OR CAUSING IN

00:54:45.048 --> 00:54:46.583
STATE STUDENTS TO BE TURNED

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.552
AWAY FROM ADMISSIONS IS THAT

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.855
WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING. THAT IS

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:55.091
CORRECT SIR- IN FACT AT THE

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:57.794
MOMENT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:54:57.861 --> 00:55:00.096
HAS OVER FIVE THOUSAND

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:00.897
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:03.266
UNDERGRADUATES ENROLLED FOR

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:05.035
HOME WE'VE NOT RECEIVED THE

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:07.404
STATE OF MARGINAL COST OF

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.506
INSTRUCTION SHARE. AND IF WE

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.541
START REDUCING OUR NON RESIDENT

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:13.443
POPULATION WHO ARE CURRENTLY

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.779
PAYING FOR THOSE STUDENTS- IT

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:18.214
DOES REDUCE THE QUALITY OF

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:19.916
INSTRUCTION FOR THE STUDENTS

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.051
OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD NEVER KICK

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:23.520
OUT. A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:26.189
STUDENT UP BUT WE DO HAVE TO

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:28.591
LOOK AT MAINTAINING THE QUALITY

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:31.227
IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND YOU SEE

00:55:31.294 --> 00:55:33.396
QUALITY SEEMS TO BE CORRELATED

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:36.232
WITH HIGH MONEY COMING FROM OUT

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:38.034
OF STATE AND I DO THINK THAT.

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.269
THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT'S IN

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.904
FRONT OF US BACK FEELS THAT

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.606
MONEY AND THE IDEA IS TO MAKE

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:44.808
SURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THE

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.142
NEEDS OF ALL THE IN STATE

00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:48.445
STUDENTS AND- AND DESPITE THE

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:51.281
FACT THAT IT. THE STATEMENT WAS

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:52.615
MADE THAT THE MASTER PLAN

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:55.085
PERCENTAGES MATT I JUST GET SO

00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:57.120
MANY CALLS FROM PARENTS TO FEEL

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:57.921
LIKE THEIR KIDS ARE GETTING

00:55:57.987 --> 00:56:00.924
INTO UC AND SO I THINK THAT IS

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.326
A GENUINE CONCERN. FROM THE

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:06.262
COMMITTEE AND I DO SUBSCRIBE TO

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:09.566
THE PROPOSAL AS A WAY OF MAKING

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:11.067
SURE THAT YOU SEE DOESN'T SEE

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.670
THIS AS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE BUT-

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:15.271
EQUITY ISSUE FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:16.439
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:17.941
PARTICIPATING IN THE UNIVERSITY

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:19.943
OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. I'M SURE

00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:22.679
WE'LL HAVE MORE ANIMATED DEBATE

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:24.481
LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE ANY

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.983
COMMENTS WELL THERE IS A HAND

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.184
FROM THE PERSON I WAS GONNA ASK

00:56:28.251 --> 00:56:34.157
IF YOU HAD A COMMENT- DOES THE.

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:34.791
L. A- WISH TO COMMENT ON THIS.

00:56:34.858 --> 00:56:35.825
YEAH THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP-

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:37.193
JUST PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.895
INFORMATION TO THE DISCUSSION-

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:44.300
JUST HAD- AND WE DID LOOK AT-

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:45.802
THAT'S YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.771
LOOKING AT DEMAND AND CAPACITY

00:56:47.837 --> 00:56:50.006
AT UC. AS WELL SEE THIS YEAR WE

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:51.341
DID LOOK AT THAT A FEW YEARS

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:55.078
AGO IN A REPORT- AND I ACTUALLY

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:56.312
JUST SAW IT JUST ON THE DEMAND

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:57.847
POINT I THINK ONE THING JUST TO

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:59.549
JUST TO. SHARPEN KEEP IN MIND

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:00.416
AS YOU SAID YOU'RE THINKING

00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:03.019
ABOUT THIS. IS THAT- YOU SEE

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:05.088
HAS HISTORICALLY BAD THE MASTER

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:08.558
PLAN- TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:10.493
ELIGIBILITY FULL- BUT IN RECENT

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.761
YEARS THEY'VE HAD TO

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:14.364
INCREASINGLY- REFER STUDENTS

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:17.100
TO- CAMPUSES LIKE RIVER CITING

00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:18.968
MERCED. CAMPUS IS THAT MAY BE

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:20.236
WORTH THEIR FIRST CHOICE OR

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:20.904
THAT THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.906
APPLY TO. AND A LOT OF THE

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:24.741
STUDENTS END UP CHOOSING NOT TO

00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:27.243
ENROLL YOU SEE- AND SO ONE OF

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:28.812
THE- KEY ISSUES FOR THE

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:31.881
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN- NOT JUST

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.449
EXPANDING ACCESS SYSTEM WIDE

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:34.584
BUT CONTINUING TO SPEND EXPAND

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:35.852
ACCESS OF THESE HIGHER DEMAND

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:37.520
CAMPUSES LIKE BERKELEY AND UCLA

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.422
AND SAN DIEGO. AND IF YOU'RE

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:41.090
THINKING ABOUT- OPTIONS TO

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.792
EXPAND WILL THAT. ON THAT WOULD

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:43.860
BE ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:45.528
THAT THE NON RESIDENT PLAN THAT

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.263
YOU'RE CONSIDERING-

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:48.698
SPECIFICALLY LOOKS AT EVERY

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.466
CAMPUS AND PRESUMABLY ONE OF

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:52.836
THE REASONS FOR THAT IS- THAT

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:54.070
IT IS TARGETING THESE HIGHER

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:55.004
DEMAND CAMPUSES THAT HAVE

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:58.174
THESE. HIGHER SHARES

00:57:58.241 --> 00:57:59.809
NONRESIDENT STUDENTS- YOU DON'T

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.711
IN TERMS OF CAPACITY AGAIN-

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.112
JUST IT JUST IT PROVIDE A LOT

00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:05.048
MORE INFORMATION THEIR- COMMON

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:07.050
WE LOOK AT CAPACITY ISSUES

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.651
WHICH WE DO SEE SOME-

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:09.886
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AT SOME OF

00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:11.454
THESE ARE HIGH DEMAND CAMPUSES

00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:13.957
FOR INSTRUCTIONAL SPACES- BUT

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:16.559
AS- A SINGER REFERRED TO- A LOT

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:20.697
OF THE SPACES ARE- CLASSROOMS

00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:23.533
THAT ARE- THEY'RE THEY'RE LIKE

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.034
SMALLER CLASSROOMS ARE NOT

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:26.302
NECESSARILY CAN FIGURE TO THE

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:27.203
WAY THEY DELIVER INSTRUCTION

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.972
TODAY THAT'S WHY WHEN SHE WAS

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:30.206
REFERRING TO THE RENOVATION OF

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:31.341
FACILITIES THAT THAT COULD BE

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:32.909
ONE WAY. TO IMPROVE THE

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:34.911
UTILIZATION OF THOSE FACILITIES

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:37.480
IS BY RECONFIGURING MOM- AS YOU

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:38.982
AS IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:40.984
SEGMENTS ALSO- COULD EXPAND

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.585
SUMMER MOMENT MORE THAN IT DOES

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:45.054
ANOTHER WAY ON THAT DATE STATUS

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:46.589
HISTORICALLY TRYING TO EXPAND-

00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:49.325
ENROLLMENT WITHOUT AN

00:58:49.392 --> 00:58:49.826
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:50.927
FACILITIES. I WOULD ALSO THERE

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:52.061
IS THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED

00:58:52.128 --> 00:58:53.897
ABOUT LONG RANGE DEVELOP PLANS

00:58:53.963 --> 00:58:55.365
AND THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:56.966
OKAY THIS IS A TOLD US EVEN IF

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.134
THEY DO HAVE UNDER UTILIZED

00:58:58.201 --> 00:58:59.435
FACILITIES SOMETIMES THEY FACE

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:01.404
SOME EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS. ALL

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:02.572
LIKE THEIR LONG RANGE

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:04.340
DEVELOPMENT PLANS CONNECT- AND

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:05.875
ROMAN GROWTH JOB INCREASES IN

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.744
HOUSING SO THAT DOES CREATE AT

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.145
LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM SOME

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.046
SOME CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:12.782
ABILITY TO. MEET YOUR TO YOUR

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:14.484
INVOLVEMENT EXPECTATIONS AND SO

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:15.385
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER THING TO

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:16.786
CONSIDER TOO IF YOU'RE THINKING

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:20.823
ABOUT HOW MUCH CAPACITY RULES.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:21.991
I JUST HOPE THAT HOPEFULLY IN

00:59:22.058 --> 00:59:23.726
FOR. PROVIDES A LITTLE IT DOES

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:25.228
AND IT AND I DO HAVE A HAND

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:26.663
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.531
BEFORE I RECOGNIZE HIM I FEEL

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:29.899
OBLIGATED TO MAKE A COMMENT

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.200
ABOUT SOMETHING YOU DID AT THE

00:59:31.267 --> 00:59:34.170
BEGINNING. AND IT'S- JUST I

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:37.840
DON'T WANT SILENCE TO SORT OF-

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:40.476
IT HERE THAT. MMHM RIVERSIDE

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:42.111
AND PARTICULARLY MERCED OR

00:59:42.178 --> 00:59:44.647
INFERIOR CAMPUSES IN SOME WAY.

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:47.350
AND MERCED IN PARTICULAR. HAS

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.452
GONE FROM ZERO TO SIXTY IN

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:52.622
PROVIDING EXCELLENT EDUCATION

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:53.957
OPPORTUNITIES EVEN THOUGH. WE

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:55.258
PROBABLY SHOULD FUNDED SO IT'S

00:59:55.325 --> 00:59:56.659
NOT A HUNDRED AND NINE EVERY

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:58.094
TIME SOMEBODY SITS OUTSIDE OR

00:59:58.161 --> 01:00:00.196
TO GRADUATION A BECAUSE THERE'S

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.131
NOT IT'S AN INTERIOR BUILDING

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:04.667
TO DO THAT. BUT OUR OUR OUR I

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:05.501
WANT TO SPEAK FOR THOSE

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:08.304
CAMPUSES AND IN TERMS OF THE

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.706
EXCELLENCE OF THE EDUCATION

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:07.869
STUDENT ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:09.771
AID. BUT ALSO A LINE CALIFORNIA

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:11.706
SYSTEM WITH THE NEW FEDERAL ONE

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.041
BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:14.376
AS I JUST MENTIONED. THIS WOULD

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:15.744
AVOID THE CURRENT CHALLENGES

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.512
THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FACE

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:18.680
WHEN ASSESSING THE FINANCIAL

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:20.415
AID THAT. THEY COULD ACCESS AND

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.983
HAVING CURRENTLY TWO SEPARATE

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:26.288
SETS OF STANDARDS TO UNDERSTAND

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:26.855
ONE FOR FEDERAL AID ONE FOR

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:29.291
STATE IT. IN ESTABLISHING CAL

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:30.792
GRANT TO FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:32.694
STUDENTS AND CAL GRANT FOR OUR

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:33.562
STUDENTS AND OUR FOUR YEAR

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.830
INSTITUTIONS WE CAN ALSO TAILOR

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:37.332
EACH PROGRAMS REFLECT THE

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:39.634
UNIQUE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS.

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:41.203
ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS IS

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:42.837
THAT THE PROPOSED CAL GRANT YOU

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.139
WOULD HAVE A LATER APPLICATION

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:45.840
DEADLINE OF SEPTEMBER SECOND.

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.275
WHICH REFLECTS THE OPEN ACCESS

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:48.443
NATURE OF OUR COMMUNITY

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.245
COLLEGES AND WOULD ALLOW THOSE

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:51.846
LATER DECIDING STUDENTS TO

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:53.682
STILL ACCESS FINANCIAL AID.

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:55.016
THIS WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.918
MAINTAIN THE MARCH SECOND.

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:59.087
FILING DEADLINE FOR CAL GRANT

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:00.655
FOR AWARD WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:01.923
ALLOW FOR FINANCIAL AID

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.024
PACKAGING TO OCCUR AT THE

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.693
CAMPUS LEVEL AS WELL AS FOR

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:06.261
THOSE FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES TO

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:07.996
BE EXTENDED TO STUDENTS. AS

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:10.765
THEY CONSIDER AT WHICH

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:11.333
INSTITUTION THEY'RE GOING TO

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:12.767
ENROLL. THE CALTRAIN EQUITY

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.202
FRAMEWORK IS THE PRODUCT OF

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:15.303
YEARS OF DIALOGUE OF THE

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.138
COMMISSION WITH STUDENTS WITH

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.807
HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS AND

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:20.809
OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. I'M ALL

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.421
ACCESSIBLE WE HOPE THAT THIS

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:34.522
FRAMEWORK CAN SERVE AS A

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:35.457
STARTING PLACE FOR THAT

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:36.725

UNDERSTOOD IN THE COMMISSION.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:05.620
THINK IN A MOMENT I'M GONNA SEE

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:07.255
IF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.324
BUT I THOUGHT. RATHER THAN

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.792
QUESTIONS I WOULD MAKE A BRIEF

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:13.895
STATEMENT HERE- WHICH IS THAT

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:16.464
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE WAITING FOR THE

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.366
MAY REVISE ITS TWO DAYS AWAY.

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.735
AND AS I MENTIONED DURING THE

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:23.004
OPENING COMMENTS THE SENATE HAS

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:27.742
HAD. ITS OF PLAN OF FOR DEBT

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:30.612
FREE COLLEGES AS PART OF ITS A

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.814
BILL BACKED BOLDLY A BUDGET

01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:34.582
EFFORT. AND THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.885
INTERESTINGLY ONE BY ONE

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:39.387
WHETHER IT'S- WITH THE PARTS OF

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:41.189
THE STIMULUS TO DROUGHT PACKAGE

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:43.625
THE WILDLIFE FOR WILDFIRE

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.727
PACKAGE WIDDOP THAT ALREADY. OR

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:48.129
WHAT HE'S DOING WITH US SOME OF

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.631
THE K. THROUGH TWELVE AND

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:52.267
PRESCHOOL THINGS. HE'S TRACKING

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:53.868
THE BOXES THAT THE SENATE HAD

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:55.737
LAID OUT SO WE CAN ONLY HOPE

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:58.073
THAT HE CHECKS THIS BOX ON ON

01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:59.908
FRIDAY WITH WHAT HE PROPOSES.

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:01.609
BUT I THINK THE SIGNIFICANT

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:04.145
THING HERE IS. IS THAT THE

01:23:04.212 --> 01:23:06.314
EXISTING STUDENT AID SYSTEM

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:09.084
SEEMS TO HAVE LIMITS IN PLACE.

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.952
THAT JUST HELP GET TO AN

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:13.488
EXISTING AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:16.958
MONEY TO PROVIDE THE GRANTS AND

01:23:17.025 --> 01:23:17.792
WOULD PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.895
GRANTS. AND THAT WHAT REALLY

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:25.867
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IS. IS

01:23:25.934 --> 01:23:26.468
BROADER GRANTS IN TERMS OF CAR

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:32.006
X. BEYOND FEES BUT SECOND WORRY-

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.074
TO INCLUDE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:34.609
BEEN EXCLUDED UNDER THESE WHAT

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.811
I THINK ARE ARE ARTIFICIAL

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:40.882
REALLY. OF LIMITS THAT ARE

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:44.052
UNFORTUNATE SO THAT REENTRY

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:46.521
STUDENTS CAN QUALIFY. ARE THAT

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:48.490
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:51.025
SORT OF OUR PART OF THE FACTORS

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:52.327
THAT LIMIT PEOPLE AND I THINK

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:54.229
THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN DOES IT

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.530
WOULD ADD HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:58.533
OF STUDENTS. IN A WAY THAT IT

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.536
TRULY WOULD GET TO A DEBT FREE

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.271
COLLEGE OR MANY PEOPLE AND IT

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:06.307
WOULD PRIORITIZE THOSE IS ONE

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.309
OF THE COMMON OR SAID. ABOUT

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.879
FOUR OR AT THE LOWEST INCOMES

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:13.281
AS WELL AS BEEFING UP THE

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:16.518
MIDDLE CLASS OF PROGRAMS WHILE.

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:20.388
AND SO I THINK THIS IS AN

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:23.291
INCREDIBLE EFFORT AND WE HAVE.

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:24.893
THIS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IF YOU

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.327
JUST LOOK AT THE BUDGET FOR THE

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:28.029
LAST TWO DECADES WE'RE JUST

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:29.697
DOING TRIAGE ON EVERYTHING.

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:32.100
THIS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:34.102
TO BUDGET FOR IMPACT IT ANOTHER

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:36.204
NUMBER OF PLACES AND THIS IS

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:38.039
ONE. THAT WOULD JUST MAKE A

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.674
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.876
AFFORDABILITY AND THE ABILITY

01:24:41.943 --> 01:24:43.445
OF CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:46.347
HIGHER EDUCATION AND IRONICALLY

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:48.383
WE SPOKE ABOUT. FEES AND

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.418
LIMITATIONS AND CAPACITY IN THE

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:52.320
PRIOR ITEMS I MEAN WE MAY HAVE

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:53.922
TO REVISIT THOSE IF WE ACTUALLY

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.557
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:57.025
AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT

01:24:57.091 --> 01:25:00.662
THAT'S WHAT. THIS DOES AND SO I

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.630
THINK RATHER THAN ASK QUESTIONS

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:04.232
I'M JUST GOING TO OFFER THESE

01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:06.167
COMMENTS AND THE COMMENTS THAT

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:09.037
I HEARD WATCHED SOME OF. THE

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:12.173
WITNESSES SAID ON THE PANEL AND

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.509
OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LOOK AT ANY

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.511
FINE TUNING IF WE HAVE TO DO IT

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:19.080
AS WE MOVE ALONG SO I JUST WANT

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:21.616
TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS. ON THE

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:24.853
ENTIRE ITEM AND ASK MY

01:25:24.919 --> 01:25:25.420

MICROPHONE YEAH. I'M JUST A

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:34.696
QUICK QUESTION AND I THINK IT

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:37.332
WAS- IT WAS ADDRESSED EARLIER

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:38.600
TODAY BY FOR CLARIFICATION

PURSES OUR PURPOSE IS MOVING

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:42.136
FORWARD HAS THERE BEEN A COST

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:44.305
ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE TOTAL COST

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:45.373
TO IMPLEMENT BOTH THE SENATE

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.208
PLAN FOR REDUCING AT A STATE

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:50.111
RESIDENT INVOLVEMENT AND THE

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:50.712
DEBT FREE COLLEGE PACKAGE WILL

AS- AS- AND THAT ARE PULLING A

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:29.984
COST ESTIMATE FOR THIS PLAN IS

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.386
APPROXIMATELY FIVE BILLION

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.321
DOLLARS THAT DOESN'T SEEM THAT

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.689
ALL OF THE OPTIONS THAT WE

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:36.157
DISCUSSED EARLIER. WOULD BE

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:38.159
PURSUED. IF THE SENATE WHERE TO

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:39.494
PURSUE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE

01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:41.496
PLAN FOR EXAMPLE JUST REMOVING

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:42.797
THE BARRIERS RELATING TO EACH

IN TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:45.266
JUST EXPANDING THE COW CAN

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:46.534
ACCESS AWARD. AND THE COST

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:47.969
WOULD BE JUST A FRACTION OF

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.070
THAT AMOUNT AND WILL BE HAPPY

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:50.038
TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:53.908
COMMITTEE STAFF. TO REFINE THIS

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:55.310
ESTIMATE. N. OR JUST OFF THE

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.078
COMMON TO. THE THAT THERE'S A

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.947
STRUGGLE HERE BETWEEN THE

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.815
BRANCHES AND WHAT IS FUNDED AND

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:02.517
I KNOW THAT- OF THE STUDENT AID

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.018
COMMISSION. I THINK IT WAS THE

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.153
STUDENT AID COMMISSION BUT

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:06.454
WONDERFUL MENTIONED COMMUNITY

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:08.389
COLLEGES WHICH WOULD BE A HEFTY

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:09.891
COST IF THAT CAME AND THEN

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.559
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AND SOME

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:14.062
OF THE VERSIONS AND SO. IT WILL

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.797
BE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS THAT

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:18.499
WOULD BE MADE. THAT WOULD

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.100
ACTUALLY DECIDE WHAT THE COSTS

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:21.402
WOULD BE. OKAY IDEA FOR THE

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:23.438
QUESTIONS JUST ONE MORE AND I'M

01:27:23.504 --> 01:27:27.976
NOT SURE AB WHO DO BEST TO

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:29.410
ANSWER THAT- SO WITH THE STATE

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:30.912
FUNDING AND TRYING TO GET THE

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:33.715
DEBT FREE COLLEGE. IS THERE ANY

01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:34.949
THING IN PLACE THAT WOULD

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:37.251
INCENTIVIZE KEEPING THE COST OF

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:41.489
ATTENDING COLLEGE- AT LOWER-

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:44.559
AT. A LOWER PORTION. IT JUST

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:47.862
SEEMS IF WE- IF WE ARE

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:51.199
COMMITTING OURSELVES AS A STATE

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:53.267
TO FULLY FIND STATE COLLEGE

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:55.403
THEN THE COST OF TUITION AND

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:57.005
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES INTO

01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:58.973
ATTENDING COLLEGE IS THERE ANY

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.508
INCENTIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:03.111
THEY REMAIN AT A CONSTANT OR

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:05.079
OR- AFFORDABLE FOR THE LONG

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:07.815
TERM. I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.951
TAKE A STAB AT THAT IT IT'S

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:13.988
BECAUSE- MMHM. THE THERE WERE

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:15.490
THERE ARE REALLY TWO THAT MIGHT

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:17.925
BE WITHIN OUR CONTROL F. AND

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.527
THAT WOULD BE THE FEES AND THE

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:22.463
OVERALL COST OF OUR OF THE

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:24.832
INSTITUTION THAT RESULTS IN THE

01:28:24.899 --> 01:28:27.101
LEVEL FEES AND THEN BOXES TO

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:28.903
THE EXTENT THAT WE DO ANYTHING

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.739
WITH REGARD TO BOOKS BY HOUSING

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:33.741
AND FOOD AND OTHER THINGS ARE

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.643
NOT THINGS THAT CAN. SEE A

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:39.414
RADICALLY THE A AND I KNOW THAT

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:40.848
BECAUSE OF THE BLOWING UP

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:42.150
HOUSING MARKET IN MY HOME

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:43.985
REGION THE LATEST LONG RANGE

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.620
DEVELOPMENT CLIENT PLAN FOR THE

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.690
UNIVERSITY WOULD PUT A 100% OF

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:50.758
NEW CAMPUS GROWTH ON CAMPUS

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:51.926
WITH CAMPUS HOUSING AND THEY

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:55.530
WERE CONSTRUCTED BUT WAS AS

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:56.164
MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS ITEM.

01:28:56.230 --> 01:29:01.402
THE UC SYSTEM FOR HOUSING IS-

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:03.004
CHALLENGING MORE WHO ARE

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:04.072
LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT WORK

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:06.274
BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW THE NEW

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.643
HOUSING PROJECT IN AND THEN

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:10.378
PEOPLE AREN'T BUILT FOR THE

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:12.180
COST OF THAT PROJECT THAT JUST

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:13.848
GOES IN AND SPREAD AMONG ALL

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:16.150
PEOPLE. ARE AMONG ALL

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:18.853
FACILITIES ARE IN A COMMON

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.857
PAYMENT ARE LEVEL AND SO IT'S

01:29:22.924 --> 01:29:25.059
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE WORKING

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:27.628
WITH THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE CSU

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:28.930
COMMUNITY COLLEGES COULD BE

01:29:28.996 --> 01:29:30.965
MORE EFFICIENT IN WHAT THEY DO

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.400
IT IN THEIR COST NOT BEING

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:34.435
HIGHER FOR WE COULD DO

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.704
SOMETHING THAT LIMITS. SOME OF

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:38.005
THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE COST

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:39.774
OF BOOKS WHICH IS BEEN

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:41.309
DISCUSSED AND ACTED UPON A

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:42.276
DIFFERENT PLACE BUT OTHER

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:44.579
THINGS ARE WITH I THINK A

01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:46.481
LITTLE BIT OUT OF CONTROL. I

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:48.049
THINK DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:52.520
QUESTION GREAT I THINK A CENTER

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:53.121
MEN HAD A COMMON. YEAH I JUST

01:29:53.187 --> 01:29:53.821
WANTED TO HAVE LIKE SENATOR

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.623
LEAHY CARE LAYERED I HAVE MAKE

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:56.924
A BRIEF COMMENT HERE WE JUST

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:59.393
SAW RECENTLY THAT. CALIFORNIA

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.695
EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN

01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:02.764
POPULATION THE PAST YEAR. AND

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.866
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE CAUSES

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:07.635
OF CALIFORNIANS- THE CLIENT

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:10.471
POPULATION. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:12.507
THE COST OF LIVING HERE AND

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:13.708
PART OF THAT'S ACOSTA HOUSING A

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.009
PART OF THAT IS AFFECTED SO

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:17.779
MANY STUDENTS GRADUATE. WITH

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:19.280
UNSUSTAINABLE LEVELS OF DEBT

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:21.315
AND SO I REALLY APPLAUD THIS

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:23.785
GENERAL THRUST TOWARDS- TRYING

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:25.653
TO INCREASE STUDENT AID. HI

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.822
MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE AND IN

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:29.123
PARTICULAR I THINK IT'S ALSO

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:30.458
IMPORTANT TO DESIGN THESE

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:31.492
PROGRAMS WHILE THESE EFFORTS

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.861
WELL AND- THE OBVIOUS ADVICE

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:34.929
BECAUSE I'M IN THE STATE SENATE

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:36.297
BUT I THINK THE SENATE'S BILL

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:38.599
BACKED BOLDLY PLANT. ALSO HAS

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:40.401
THE BENEFIT OF BEING RELATIVELY

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.837
SIMPLE I KNOW THAT TOO MANY

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:45.273
STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I JUST

01:30:45.339 --> 01:30:46.774
ARE OVERWHELMED WITH ALL THE

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:48.976
DIFFERENT- AIDING GRANT TACTIC

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:50.178
IS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND I

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:52.346
THINK. THE BENEFIT WHEN WE TRY

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:54.348
TO MAKE THESE SIMPLER EASIER TO

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:55.716
UNDERSTAND PROGRAMS THAT

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:57.685
AUTOMATICALLY KICK IN AND SO- I

01:30:57.752 --> 01:30:58.686
JUST WANT TO FLOOD THE

01:30:58.753 --> 01:31:00.087
ARCHITECTS OF THIS PLAN FOR

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:01.823
THAT- AND APPLAUD YOU ALL FOR

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:02.857
YOUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO MAKE

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:07.428
COLLEGE. MORE AFFORDABLE FOR

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:08.162
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND LET ME

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.963
SUBSCRIBE TO THAT AND THEN I DO

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:12.934
CAN'T HELP BUT ADD. IN THAT IS.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.902
IT WHEN I WAS CHOOSING TO RUN

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:18.639
FOR THE SENATE. I HAD A VERY.

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:20.675
SELF REVEALING MOMENT WHEN I

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:22.143
REALIZED THAT I HAD JUST COME

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.911
OF AGE IN A UNIQUE TIME IN

01:31:23.978 --> 01:31:27.715
CALIFORNIA VERY LUCKY- YOU KNOW

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:31.052
THE BABY BOOM AN- SO I MANAGED

01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:32.119
TO EVEN THOUGH MY MOTHER WENT

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:33.688
BACK TO COLLEGE AT THE SAME

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:36.324
TIME AS ME. AND MY FATHER WAS

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:39.193
WORKING AS A TEACHER I MANAGED

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.528
TO GET OUT OF COLLEGE WITHOUT

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:43.030
DEBT AND I WAS ABLE TO BUY A

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:46.267
HOUSE AND IT'S LIKE WHAT COULD

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:49.237
I AS A SENATOR DO. TO AFFECT

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.272
THOSE EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS OF

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:52.607
AFFORDABILITY FOR THE NEXT

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:54.876
GENERATION WHO DO NOT FEEL A

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.911
STAKE IN OUR SYSTEM WHETHER

01:31:56.978 --> 01:32:02.283
IT'S HOUSING- OR WHETHER IT'S-

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.419
IT- FEES. COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:06.854
OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE FACT

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:08.389
THAT WE HAVE NOT LEFT CLIMATE

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:09.590
IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:11.259
NEXT THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WHAT

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:14.495
CAN WE DO. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:16.564
THINGS THAT COULD FUNDAMENTALLY

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:18.933
CHANGE. WHETHER PEOPLE MIGHT BE

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.735
ABLE TO START MOVING TOWARD

01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:22.236
HOUSING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:24.538
JUST MORTGAGING THEIR LIFE AWAY

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:26.607
TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I THINK.

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:28.242
IT'S RARE THAT WE CAN MAKE A

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:29.443
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE LIKE

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:31.379
THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:33.481
AND THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT.

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:37.151
SO I'M GOING TO THANK OR PANEL

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.686

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:41.422
CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS. AND THE

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:43.524
