STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES TO

TODAY- WE SUPPORT THE BILL UP

00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:00.504
FOR TWO. WHARTON REASONS FIRST

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.939
OF ALL DESPITE THE DECADE LONG

00:49:03.006 --> 00:49:05.242
SURGEON STATE REVENUES MOST

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.411
COUNTIES HAVE HAD LACKLUSTER

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:09.780
GROWTH IN THEIR GENERAL PLANS IN

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:11.281
MOST COUNTIES THAT GENERAL FUND

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:12.883
REVENUES PER CAPITA ARE STILL

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:15.285
BELOW THE LEVELS THEY WERE AT

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:16.586
BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION TO

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:18.955
RECESSION TO GO NOW BUT IN REAL

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:20.791
DOLLARS THIS PROBLEM IS MOST

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:22.793
PRONOUNCED IN SMALL COUNTIES. M.

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:23.660
PARTLY BECAUSE THE NEED FOR

00:49:23.727 --> 00:49:25.362
GOVERNMENT SERVICE DOESN'T SCALE

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:26.963
DOWN PROPORTIONATELY WITH

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.765
POPULATION SIZE AND THE OTHER

00:49:28.832 --> 00:49:30.901
REASON IS BECAUSE THE PHYSICAL

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:32.035
AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:34.204
WILDFIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.939
HAVE FALLEN DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:40.444

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:43.447
YEAR WE THINK ANOTHER. GREAT

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:46.083
REASON. FOR THIS BILL. INSTEAD

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.118
THAT CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURES

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:49.386
ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE STATE

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:52.255
APPROPRIATION LIMIT- AND SO THIS

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.157
IS A GREAT TIME THIS YEAR IN

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:55.559
PARTICULAR FOR THE STATE TO

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:57.260
INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:59.396

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:01.531
TO THESE AREAS THAT. DO BEAR A

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:03.600
DISPROPORTIONATE. RISKING

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.768
DISPROPORTIONATE ECONOMIC

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.604
EFFECTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS-

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:10.240
AND THAT IN MANY CASES. HAVE

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.075
LACKLUSTER REVENUE GROWTH SO FOR

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:16.513

BUT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.209
WITH THESE FUNDS AVAILABLE THAT

ENERGY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:32.929
GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE
