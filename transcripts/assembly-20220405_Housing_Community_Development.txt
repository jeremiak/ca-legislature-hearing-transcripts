FOR HEARING US THIS MORNING MY NAME IS TIED DAVID I IN THE RIGHT I MEAN IF YOU STOP FOR JUST A MAJORITY AUDIO IS NOT WORKING- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET YOUR TESTIMONY SO OTHER PEOPLE CAN HEAR IT BESIDES US I'M GONNA BE WE WAS AT THE SAME FOR ME NO I THINK I CAN HEAR YOURS I WAS IN THE WAY BETTER THE SECOND MAYBE I CAN'T. I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE- YOUR SOUND LIKE YOU'RE ON. THE PREFERRED. YES YEAH. THE REST OF THE- PRACTICE. ARE WE GET. NOW WE'RE GOOD. ALL RIGHT. OR ANY PROCEEDING. I THINK KILLED. A GOOD MORNING. I ANTI DAVID. EXACT ADDRESS. OF THE HOUSE. ACTION CO- ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE. AS THE COMMITTEE AS WELL WHERE THE STATE TEST THE BONUS. IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO CREATE HOUSING. AT ALL LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY. THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE. OF THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW. WAS TO INCENTIVIZE. ON SITE. AFFORDABLE UNITS. IN EXCHANGE. FOR THOSE ON SITE UNITS. ARM DEVELOPERS ARE DEVELOPMENTS WERE- GRANTED. BONUS UNITS. THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. ARMED MARKET RATE. AN UNENCUMBERED. A SOME UNITS. ARE CIRCUMVENTING THE SPIRIT OF THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW BY CHARGING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FEES ON THE STATE DENSITY BONUS UNITS THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW BY CHARGING FEES HAS A REAL WORLD% NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR EXAMPLE IN MY HOMETOWN OF SAN FRANCISCO OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IMPOSED IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FATE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ON BONUS UNITS. SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAVE INDEPENDENTLY FOUND AND VERIFIED THE URBAN FORTY TWO PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ENTITLED UNDER THE STATE DENSITY BONUS AND SAN FRANCISCO BUT NOT ONE OF THOSE UNITS HAVE PAID THE FIFTY. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THOSE FORTY TWO PROJECTS ONLY TO HAVE STARTED CONSTRUCTION ONE IS A THAT IS EXEMPT FROM THE FEE THE OTHER PROJECT WAS GRANDFATHERED IN IT WOULD NOT ENTITLE BEFORE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO OF THE V. FORTY REMAINING PROJECTS THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING OF WHICH SEVEN HUNDRED OF THOSE UNITS WILL BE PERMANENTLY SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE. AND THAT THESE FEES ARE COST UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DOOR. SO I WAS SPEAKING TO A DEVELOPER YESTERDAY WHO IS ONE OF THE PROJECT IS ALL OF A TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY UNIT PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN ENTITLED THAT HAS A FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. IN LIEU FEE FROM THE FROM THE BONUS UNITS AND THAT PROJECT IS NOT MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE OF THOSE FEES. SO TO ME THIS SEEMS LIKE A LOSE LOSE PROPOSITION. THAT THIS FEES BEEN PUT IN PLACE AT ZERO DOLLARS A BEEN COLLECTED. AND THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND UNITS OF MIXED INCOME HOUSING THAT IS NOT NEW FORD. OF WHICH SEVEN HUNDRED AGAIN OF THOSE UNITS IS PARTLY SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE. SO TO ME THIS SEEMS LIKE A POLICY LOSS ON BOTH ENDS. SO YOU KNOW IN IT- INCLUSION THIS BILL WILL UNLOCK MIXED INCOME HOUSING IN MY HOMETOWN AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURE THAT OTHER MUNICIPALITIES DO NOT ADOPT EQUALLY HARMFUL POLICIES AIMED AT UNDERMINING STATE TENCENT STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. SURE YES. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS BEATRICE GARDEN S. DUNCAN. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT IT TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL. TWENTY SIXTY THREE I'M A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER I HEALTH AND WELLNESS ADVOCATE I'M A LEUKEMIA PATIENT I'M ALSO A MOTHER GRANDMOTHER AND GREAT GRANDMOTHER. WHO IS NO LONGER ABLE TO LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AS MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN DUE TO THAT THEY AREAS HOUSING SHORTAGE DISPLACEMENT AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. MY HUSBAND AND I MARRIED REYES STAR KIDS IN WELCOME MY GRANDKIDS WHILE RENTING IN SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THE WESTERN ADDITION INGLESIDE. AND BAYVIEW MY HUSBAND AND I DEVOTED OUR CAREERS TO WORKING IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT. IN CITY GOVERNMENT AND WITH LOCAL NONPROFITS. BUT AFTER LIVING IN THE CITY FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS WE BECAME PRICED OUT OF THE VERY DUBBED OUT AT THAT STAGE T THE VERY TIME WHEN WE NEEDED TO BE CLOSER CLOSEST TO OUR CHILDREN. GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. NOW WIDOW. I'M LIVING IN SAN LEANDRO I WISH I COULD AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR MY FAMILY BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MY STORY IS. IS ONE OF THEM TO COME IN FOR FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT SENIOR CITIZENS ARE GETTING PUSHED OUT OF OTHER COME OF THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OUR CITIES HAVE FAILED TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING FOR RESIDENTS OF ALL INCOME LEVELS. OUR LEADERS SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT FASTER AND EASIER BUT MORE AFFORDABLE TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES SO THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE MORE ASSESSABLE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE. IN OUR FAMILIES CAN REMAIN TOGETHER. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE IS KEY TO THIS GOAL. AS A WOULD HELP ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO CREATING MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES THAT RESIDENTS WILL DEFINITELY NEED. FOR THIS REASON I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF THIS MARVELOUS COMMITTEE AN IMPORTANT COMMITTEE AND NOT PER SHOULD DECIDE TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LISTENING TO ME AND I TRULY APPRECIATE AND ASK FOR THE FULL SUPPORT OF THIS MARVELOUS AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING.

NAME ORGANIZATION AND YOUR- I FULLY FOR MANY DAYS IS THAT WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA CIVIC WELL THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND SPUR. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CORY SMITH SPEAKING IN SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE BAY AREA COUNCIL THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CALIFORNIA YIMBY CIRCULATE SAN DIEGO.

GREAT DOESN'T THERE'S ANYBODY ALSO EIGHTEEN T. OPERATE-WE'RE GONNA GO TO PHONE LINES ARE WE DO NOT HAVE THAT OKAY SO THERE IS NO PHONE LINES. SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS. GO TO OPPOSITION WE DON'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES LISTED. THERE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM THAT WE CHOOSE TO MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD. THEY'RE BEING DONE WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. IT'S QUIRK-SILVA I REPORT THIS BILL I A- REALLY THINK THESE THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION IS GOING TO BE OUR PATHWAY TO GET THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED UNITS THOUSAND UNITS AND IF WE CONTINUE TO DO THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION WE'RE GOING TO GET TO OUR GOAL BUT THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT WERE MARVELOUS BECAUSE WE NEVER HEAR THAT. AND YOU SAID IT TWICE. THANK YOU MASON WAS IT IS MR WARD THANK YOU ALSO. WE ON. RIYAN YEAH OKAY I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE ABLE TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT- THESE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE HAVING THROUGH- DOES DENSITY PROGRAMS ARE NOT- BEING- I THINK A LOT WATER DOWN- WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER SEEM I'M CONDITIONS AND FEES THAT ARE PUT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW SO IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD TO ME I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK. AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT. I'M HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTER TODAY THANK YOU. YOU AND I WILL CHIME IN WITH THAT MY SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS- THAT- COMMUNITIES HAVE A LOT OF TIMES THE WHEN IT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FEES THAT ARE GENERATED- THIS FEES ARE ACTUALLY SOME OF THEM HAVE TO HAVE AN ACCESS TO WHAT IS BEING DONE. AND THEIR NEXUS IS USUALLY A UNIT BECAUSE THAT UNIT HAS A HOUSE A PERSON THAT WORKS AND MAYBE A COUPLE OF KIDS WITH IT AND THOSE HAVE IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNITY AND THOSE IMPACTS ARE SPREAD AMONGST HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE. IN THAT COMMUNITY SO WHEN THERE'S A SURGE IN THE IMPACTS- THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THOSE NUMBERS FROM I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S SUPER INTENTIONAL TO MAKE IT CERTAINLY NOT TO MAKE MONEY- IT'S SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE AMENITIES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THAT BETTER BENEFIT EVERYBODY AND- BUT THAT BEING SAID- WHEN THEY DO THEIR GENERAL PLAN WITHOUT THE DENSITY BONUS THOSE ARE FACTORED IN SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD COMPROMISE AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO WHEN A APPROPRIATE TIME COMES I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING AND- WILL. PUT IT ON HOLD UNTIL WE GET ENOUGH OF THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS THANKS THANK YOU THANK YOU. MS REYES. YOU'RE IN THE YES WE ARE. I GUESS. YEAH MISTER REYES HAD A SPECIAL REQUEST MS BOERNER HORVATH ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT DAY TO COME UP AND GIVE HER. I THANK YOU. AB TWO TWO ONE SEVEN. MIND YOU THIS IS STILL. WE STILL DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN THE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP PRODUCTION ACT WHICH WILL EMPOWER CALIFORNIA FAMILIES TO BECOME FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS. THIS BILL ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUTATIVITY LAMENT TO INCREASE THE PER UNIT AND TOTAL PROJECT CAPS. WITHIN THE CAL HOME PROGRAM BASED ON LOCAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOMES. WE KNOW THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP IS PROVEN TO HELP FAMILIES BUILD GENERATIONAL WEALTH AND ACHIEVE FINANCIAL STABILITY. YET HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA REMAINS GROSSLY INEQUITABLE ONLY 41% OF BLACKS AND 49% OF LATINO FAMILIES OWNED THEIR HOMES COMPARED 268% OF WHITE AND SIXTY SIX PERCENT. OF ASIAN FAMILIES. THE CALHOUN PROGRAM WAS PUSHED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES AND NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS TO CONSTRUCT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PROMOTE FIRST TIME HOME OWNERSHIP. CURRENTLY THE CALHOUN PROGRAM WAS OVER SUBSCRIBED AND UNDERFUNDED WHICH HAS SEVERELY LIMITED THE ABILITY OF NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS TO ACCESS THESE FUNDS. THIS MEANS THAT DESPERATELY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOMES HAVE GONE UNBUILT YEAR AFTER YEAR. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY PERMITTING H. C. D. TO INCREASE PER UNIT AND TOTAL PROJECT ALLOCATIONS WITHIN THE CAL HOME PROGRAMS BASED ON LOCAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THIS BILL WHEN SHE WILL ENSURE THESE CAPS ARE UPDATED REGULARLY BY REQUIRING H. C. D. TO CONSIDER INCREASING ALLOCATIONS FOR EACH NEW ROUND OF FUNDING. BY UPDATING THE FUNDING CAP FOR CAL HOME AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN WILL PROMOTE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOMES AND GENERATE MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES TO BECOME FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY IS THAT B. OUR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE I'M WRKO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA AND I'M REPRESENTING ALL OF OUR AFFILIATES STATEWIDE IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS THROUGHOUT. HOW TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE DEED RESTRICTED HOME OWNERSHIP UNITS BY UPDATING THE OUTDATED AND THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO THE PER UNIT AND PER PROJECT FUNDING CAPS THIS WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE INCREASES. AS APPROPRIATE BASED ON THE ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE. TO RUN OUT WITH NO PLANS TO REPLACE IT. HABITAT THROUGH HABITAT AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ACCESSING IS FINDING AND PRODUCING MORE OWNERSHIP UNITS IN RURAL AND IN METROPOLITAN AREAS ALL THE WAY FROM SAN DIEGO THROUGH NEVADA COUNTY. BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO CONSIDER SETTING THE HIGHER UPPER LIMIT CAPS BASED ON COST THIS WILL BE MORE EQUITABLE TO INCREASING THE SUPPLY FOR ALL COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA'S COSTLY PERIOD BUT SOME AREAS ARE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS BY HAVING THE SAME EXACT FUNDING CAP REGARDLESS OF COST. THIS CREATES A GREATER BURDEN WHERE THE DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE HIGHER THE CURRENT CAP IS HUNDRED THOUSAND SO THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY ASSIST WITH MAYBE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT. OF AN AFFORDABLE UNIT IN OAKLAND OR SAN DIEGO BUT THAT MIGHT MAKE UP CLOSER TO FOR PER. OF AN AFFORDABLE UNIT IN SOMEWHERE LIKE CHICO OR TULARE COUNTY BY RAISING THE CAP ALLOWING EACH REGION CAN ACCESS AN AMOUNT THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE IN RELATION TO THEIR COST. HABITAT IS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AT LEVERAGING THE STATE FUNDING WITH PRIVATE DOLLARS AND INCREASING THE CAP WILL HELP US ACCELERATE PRODUCTION IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUILDS HIGHER DENSITY MULTI FAMILY MULTI LEVEL HOMES AS WELL AS SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. THIS LEGISLATION IS KEY TO INCREASING HOMEOWNERSHIP SUPPLY AND FOR THESE REASONS. AND A CALIFORNIA COMMENCE TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN THANK YOU HI THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND AT THIS TIME IF THERE IS ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO. SPEAK ON FAVOR OF THE BILL. NAME ORGANIZATION AND YOUR GOOD MORNING GENESIS TODAY ON BEHALF OF HOUSING ACTION COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU IT APPEARS WE JUST HAVE THE ONE SPEAKER SO WE'LL GO AHEAD IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION THERE IS NO OPPOSITION ON FILE SO THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION OF WE'VE COME UP TO THE MIKE AND STATE SO. DOESN'T APPEAR ANYBODY'S SO WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. NO QUESTIONS ARE I KNOW THE COSTS HAVE GONE UP AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE. OFFERING THE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT WE'RE NOT DECREASING OUR PRODUCTIVITY OUR UNITS ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE OUT THERE- HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTER TODAY AND AS THIS MOVE FOR YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT A FACTORED TO BUILD IN THERE THAT MIGHT JUST BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THIS SO DOES REQUIRE SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION FIVE OR- TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE CONTINUING TO. ASSIST EVEN MORE UNITS EVEN MORE FAMILIES AS TIME GOES ON THANK YOU. THIS QUIRK-SILVA. I HAVE A I KNOW THAT- AND I'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY IN MY CITIES TO BRING FORWARD MODELS. BUT ON THE UP FOR SALE PART AFTER THE HOMEOWNER HAS- MOVED INTO A HOME WHERE OWNERSHIP CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT. IN IS THAT ONLY YOUR MODEL OR WILL IT BE PART OF THIS BILL. YEAH I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER I THINK YOU THE HABITAT MODEL INCLUDES A FIRST AT FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL SO THE HOMES ARE DEED RESTRICTION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S KEPT IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FULLBUT IF A HOMEOWNER. CHOOSES TO SELL THEIR HOME AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HAS FIRST RIGHT EVERY PURCHASE SO THAT WE CAN THEN SELL THAT TO ANOTHER LOW INCOME QUALIFIED FAMILY- IS FAR AS THIS BILL- IT DOES INCLUDE THE DEED RESTRICTED BUT IT WOULD BE UP TO EACH DEVELOPER TO HAVE THEIR OWN CONDITIONS AROUND THAT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS THEN- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING WE'RE STILL OPERATING AS A SUB COMMITTEE SO ONCE WE'VE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM WILL WILL VOTE ON THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE THIS MORNING APPRECIATE IT. STILL OPERATING AS A SUB COMMITTEE. SO YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL WHEN YOU READY THANK A GOOD AFTERNOON- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL BUT ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE STAFF FOR HER WORK ON THIS BILL- THIS IS AN OFFICE SPONSORED BILL AND THAT WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE AND THE SUBSEQUENT COMMITTEE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF MANDATORY BUILDING STANDARDS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS AN EXISTING MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS SCHOOLS HOTELS AND MOTELS AND NON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING RETROFITS TO EXISTING BUILDING SAID TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT RETROFITTING. AUTOMATICALLY THERE'S A TRIGGER THAT WILL DO IT RIGHT JUST LIKE WE HAVE A STORM WATER RETENTION BASINS AND OTHER SUCH THINGS AND LANDIS IT'S A VERY COMMON THING IF YOU'RE GONNA BE PULLING UP A PARKING LOT THEN PUTTING IN SOME EVEY ARE CHARGING STATIONS- AND SO FOR THE MORE THAT WHEN THE ADDITIONS OR ALTERATIONS ARE MADE TO EXISTING MULTI FAMILY- DWELLINGS HOTELS OR MOTELS AT LEAST 25% OF SPACES MUST BE EASY READY. MEANING THAT THE PARKING SPACES HAVE BOTH THE RACEWAY AND LOWER POWER LEVEL TWO ELECTRICAL OUTLETS. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN WE SEE WE SEE THIS WITH SOLAR YOU'VE SEEN THIS OF SOLAR IF YOU'VE BEEN AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT- YOU SEE THIS WITH EV'S. IT DOESN'T HELP AND THE BEST ANALOGY IS LIKE PUTTING IN PLUMBING FOR TOILET BUT NOT PUTTING IN THE TOILET DOESN'T HELP YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM. RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS. YOU KNOW BUILDING STANDARDS ARE REQUIRING US TO PUT IN THE PLUMBING FOR IT BUT NOT THE FINAL CHARGER. AND SO WE'RE DOING THE WIRING BUT NOT THIS- THE FINAL THING YOU'RE NOT GETTING TO THAT FINAL. IN POINT AND IT'S LIKE OUR LAST MILE PROBLEM WITH BROADBAND YOU SEE THIS ACROSS THE BOARD SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO. IS FIX THAT THAT PROBLEM HERE AND MAKE SURE THAT AS WE EXPAND OUR EASY FAST OR EVEN CHARGING NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE. THAT WERE BEING VERY INCLUSIVE AND THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. WHO LIVE IN MULTI FAMILY. RENTERS ARE NOT LEFT OUT OF OUR OWN YOU KNOW STRIVING FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE CALIFORNIA. WELL THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION UP DOCTOR EASY CAPABLE AND EASY READY REQUIREMENTS THE FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS. IT DID NOT INCLUDE EASY INSTALLED REQUIREMENTS WHICH REQUIRE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. PLUS THE ACTUAL CHARGING STATION ITSELF AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS CHARGING STATION DOESN'T NEED TO BE OPERATED. BY THE MULTI FAMILY APARTMENT OWNER IT COULD BE ONE OF OUR MULTIPLE DELUDE OF INNOVATIVE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING FASTER. DOING CHARGING SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THEM THEY CAN YOU KNOW. YOU PARTNER WITH ANY NUMBER OF OUR EVEY CHARGERS IN THE STATE IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE REGULATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED ADOPTED TO FILL THIS GAP. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT AS THE COST OF EV'S. HAS DECREASED IN RECENT YEARS AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE IN THE FUTURE. EV'S ARE BECOMING MORE ACCESSIBLE TO LOW INCOME POPULATIONS HOWEVER THE LACK OF ACCESS TO HOME CHARGING. REMAINS THE MAJOR BARRIER TO EASY OPTION. AND ALSO HEALTH ENERGY COMMISSION FOUND THAT LOW INCOME COMMITTEES WE HAVE FEWER EASY CHARGING STATIONS PER CAPITA. THE MIDDLE AND HIGH INCOME COMMUNITIES RELIABLE ACCESS. TO EASY CHARGING IS PARTICULARLY CHAO J. FOR A- AND THOSE. IN MOLD UNIT. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MUCH AS 685% OF CHARGING. FOR PERSONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLES OCCURS AT HOME. BUT PEOPLE LIVING IN APARTMENTS AND CONDOMINIUMS. KNOWN AS MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS ARE MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS. DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THESE CHARGING STATIONS. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT TAKING AWAY LAYER AFTER LAYER OF BARRIERS TO ADOPTIONS OF THE VIS. YOU DO HAVE THE COST OF THE CARS THAT WE HAVE THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM AND WE NEED YOU MORE WE NEEDED A SECONDARY CAR MARKET. ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY FOR RENTERS TO CHARGE AT HOME. RENTERS ARE NOT GOING TO BUY. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CREATING A STATE- CALL CALIFORNIA REACHING OUR- CLIMATE GOALS AND REALLY ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO WHEN THERE'S A HUGE EQUITY LENS. AROUND IT AS WELL. SO AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY IT WOULD PROVIDE GREATER MORE RELIABLE ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES AND FEES OF COLOR. SPECIFICALLY THOSE LIVING IN MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS. WHICH MAKE A LECTURE AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE OWNERSHIP. MORE FEASIBLE AND AS A REMINDER I ALSO HAVE AS A SEPARATE BILL AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE AS A COMPANION TO THE- THIS WILL CREATE A TAX CREDIT OR ATTENDANCE. PROGRAMS WORKING WITH THE REV AND TAX COMMITTEE ON THIS- TO OFFSET THE IMPACT TO MULTI FAMILY UNITS AND LOW TO. MIDDLE INCOME. NEIGHBORHOODS SO WE AREN'T BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT. THIS IS THE BILL THAT REQUIRES THE MANDATE AND THEM BUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO AMEND IT WITHOUT FUNDING AND SO WE DO HAVE A SEPARATE BILL. AND SOME POINT I AM. HOPING TO GET THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE AND THROUGH- OUR HOUSE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO JOIN THEM IN THE SENATE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND THERE ARE NO WITNESSES BECAUSE I WITH THE BILL. HI GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANYBODY AND DO WE- GET STATUS OF THEIR NO PRIMARY WITNESSES- IN. SUPPORT IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS SUPPORT. APPROACH THE MIKE. NAME ORGANIZATION. MICHELADA GONNA BE AFTER THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR AND WE ELS THERE BEING NONE ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES I DON'T THINK THERE ARE. ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION PLEASE COME TO THE MIKE. YES. THE MORNING REX W. HIGH MONEY AVE A CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION BUILDING OWNERS AND MANAGERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ICSE AND NAP CALIFORNIA WE OPPOSE THIS BILL AS IT STANDS WE ARE LOOKING FOR AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE AND GETTING SOME MINUTES AND BUT AS AS IT STANDS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS COMING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD GO TO THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION- THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT THEY THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF PROCESS THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH- THINGS LIKE EVEN IF WE WERE TO TEAR UP AND ALL THE COSTS THEY WOULD TAKE THE TERRIBLE PARKING LOTS. THE OLD GRADES THAT ARE THERE AND EVEN TALKING TO SEND THE MUSE UTILITIES SAY- EVEN IF YOU HAVE THESE IN YOUR PARKING LOTS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET YOU THE ENERGY THAT WAS NECESSARILY ABLE TO GET THESE THINGS UP AND RUNNING SO AS OF NOW WE OPPOSE WERE VERY LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND GETTING TO A SPOT WHERE WE CAN BE OKAY ON THIS BILL AND VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO THAT WAS THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION SEND OUT WILL ADD JUST A NAME IS ASIAN AND YOUR APP. ABSOLUTELY SILVIO FOR OUR BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF- CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES. ASSOCIATION THANK YOU SIR NEXT. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN CARS TEAR SOME OF THE CAN. ASSIST SAYS IT. COLOR ALLEGES. ACTION COMMITTEE REPRESENTING THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND OF OUR SUBSTATIONS IN OPPOSTION. THANK YOU SIR AND- AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND ESTABLISH A QUORUM IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ONE- MA'AM SECRETARY. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. WEEKS THEY ARE HERE THEY ARE THE CARILLO. GABRIELLE GABRIEL HERE KALRA COLOR HERE KILEY QUIRK-SILVA QUIRK-SILVA HERE WAR WAR HERE WE HAVE A- RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION FOR KALRA SECOND BY WARD TO BELIEVE OKAY- DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE. OUR I'M SORRY WE BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS. SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS- I KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT AND YOU ALREADY HAVE ACCEPTED THOSE MANY THROUGH THIS- COMMITTEE AS WELL THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THOSE- THEY'RE GONNA MAKE THIS FEASIBLE I WONDER AND I WISH I. HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK YESTERDAY- THE GOVERNOR IN A SIMILAR PROPOSAL IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND HAD DIRECTED ECD- TO BE ABLE TO START TO WORK ON SOME OF THE SAME IMPROVEMENTS DO YOU HAVE ANY- INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN HAVE. HAS BSE BEEN WORKING ON THESE OR THEY DID AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY DID INTO EVM STOPPED I THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE AS A POLICY POSITION. AGAIN PUTTING IN THE PLUMBING WITHOUT PUTTING THE TOILET THAT MIGHT BE A COMPROMISE THAT WORKS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THE PAYING A BILL THAT WOULD GIVE THE FUNDING FOR IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS SOME OF THE ISSUES A LITTLE BIT AROUND THE FUNDING. OF IT- YOU KNOW AND SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM AS AS A LEGISLATURE I SEE THIS AND WE SEE IT YOU KNOW AND MY CITY WAS SOLAR ALL THE TIME YOUR REQUIRE THAT THE ALL NEW DEVELOPMENTS TO HAVE SOLAR. CAPABLE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE SOLAR PANELS SO THE DEVELOPERS ARE TAKING ON THAT COST ANYWAYS BUT IT'S NOT TRANSLATING INTO THE SUSTAINABILITY IS THAT WITH THAT LAST BIT RIGHTS LAST MILE PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE ON OUR SUSTAINABILITY AND SO THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU KIND OF WORKING ON THE TECHNICAL DETAIL HERE AS WELL AS A COMPANION WORK FOR THE FUNDING PART OF IT- THIS IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO REALLY HELP US GET TO THAT NEXT LEAP- THE EASY AVAILABILITY. AT A LOT OF RESIDENCES AND SOME OTHER PROPERTY SO- THE WORK CONTINUES THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION- ON SOME OTHER TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT'S NOT OUR INTENTION- TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE TRIGGER IS ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK. IS WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY HAD TOP TOUCHING THE PARKING ANY. THAT WOULD BE THE TRIGGER FOR INSTALLING THE EV'S RIGHT SO YOU KNOW AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IF THERE'S MORE CLARIFICATION THAT WE NEED TO DO. A GREAT ANY OTHER AND THEN I'M GONNA TURN THE CHAIR BACK OVER TO MISS WEEKS. BUT THIS BILL IS COMPLICATED AS YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT I WILL SUPPORT IT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS GOING FORWARD SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO TAKE BECAUSE TOO OFTEN IN COMMITTEES WE SAY WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO KIND OF A CHANGE OF VOTE BUT I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS- AND- I UNDERSTAND I MEAN I HAVE TO READ THEM BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NINE AMENDMENTS SO WE'RE TAKING A LOT OF THE MOMENT SO THE FIRST ONE- IS TO REFLECT THE BILL'S PROVISION TO THAT EFFECT EXISTING PARKING FACILITIES RATHER THAN BUILDINGS DIRECTLY SO THAT'S THE- THAT WHEN THEY TOUCH THE PARKING LOT IN A RETROFIT. RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE GOING AND THEY'RE DOING REDEVELOPMENT ANYWAYS THAT IS TOUCHING THE PARKING LOT NOT LIKE A BUILDING OVER HERE SO THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT THE SECOND AMENDMENT- IS THE DEFINITION OF WHAT'S COST EFFECTIVE TRIGGER TO LINE WITHOUT USING THE CAL GREENE STANDARD. THE AMENDMENT- SORRY I PROBABLY NEED TO PUT ON MY READERS FOR THIS- SORRY. I HAVE TO PUT ON MY READERS ONE TWO THERE WE GO THE THIRD AMENDMENT- IS- THE HEALTH AND SAFETY SECTION WHICH ALIGNS WITH THOSE IN THE CARAVAN STANDARDS- THE FOURTH ONE IS. A DEFINITION PROPOSING INDICES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL WHICH SPECIFIES THE TYPE OF STRUCTURES H. C. D. AND E. S. A. ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. NUMBER FIVE IS- AMEND THE BILL- SET FOR THE NEW STANDARDS OF THE NEXT TRIENNIAL COATED OPTION CYCLE RATHER THAN NEXT INTERVENING COURT CYCLES ABOUT THE TIMING SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS TIMING ISSUE OF NEW STAND IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PLUS A NEW BILL GOING TO THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO ALIGN IT- NUMBER SIX IS- AN ADDITIONAL. RELEVANT CODE SECTIONS TO PROVIDE BUILDING STANDS REFLECT THE RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND PROPOSITION FOR ADOPTION LANGUAGE APPROPRIATE FOR THE REGULATORY PROCESS RIGHT SO THAT WE ALIGN WITH YOUR STANDARD OF HOW YOU DO THINGS IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT. IS- CONFORMING CHANGES TO MAKE THE RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT ADOPTION LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT THE BILL. THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT IS- THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION TO ACQUIRE THE RELEVANT PROPOSING ENERGY CONSIDER STANDARDS FOR EASY CHARGING STATIONS. IN EXISTING BUILDINGS ONLY ONE SIGNIFICANCE CONSTRUCTION RETROFITS REPAIR ACTION IS TAKEN IF YOU LOOK THE OPPOSITION LETTER THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT AS SOON AS THIS BILL WENT INTO EFFECT. IT WOULD REQUIRE EVERY MULTI FAMILY UNIT ACROSS THE STATE TO INSTALL IN THE CHARGING WHICH IS NOT THE INTENT THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION SO WE TOOK THE BILL. I AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THAT. AND THE LAST ONE IS TO CHANGE THE CONTINUE UPDATING REQUIREMENT ONLY TO BE IN EFFECT UNTIL ADEQUATE CAR CHARGING CAPACITY IS MET IN THE SHORT TERM. AND IN THE LONG TERM. SO THOSE ARE THE NINE MM IS THAT WE'VE TAKEN TO CLARIFY. THE UP YOU KNOW WELL WAS SOME OF THOSE AMENDMENTS WERE JUST TAKEN TO MAKE THE BILL BETTER. RIGHT AND EVER AGAIN THANK THE STAFF FOR THE AND THE AND THE CHAIR FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS. SO SOME OF THEM WERE TAKEN TO MAKE THE BILL BETTER MORE CONSISTENT BECAUSE I WROTE IT MYSELF AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU WRITE BILLS OR SOMETHING AND A LAWYER- AND THEN SOME OF THEM WERE TAKEN TO AND FROM THEIR AGE. ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT WHAT WAS THE TRIGGER WHAT WOULD TRIGGER THE REQUIREMENT FOR EV'S- INSTALLATION. AND THOSE AMENDMENTS STANDING YOU'RE ALSO COMMITTING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS HUNDRED PERCENT. THIS A. L. I THINK I IT WHEN I WHEN I READ A BILL. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE OUTCOME. AND WHAT I SEE IS WHAT WE'RE ON A TRACK FOR CALIFORNIA. IS ASKING DEVELOPERS- TO. PUT IN THE PLUMBING AND NOT. THE CHARGER. AND SO THAT THE PLUMBING IS THERE IS THE COST AND THAT COST IS GOING TO COME NO MATTER WHAT. THE QUESTION IS DO WE MAKE IT USEFUL FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THAT'S THE OUTCOME AND I'M TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND SO I'M AGAIN WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION- AND TO MAKE THIS THE BEST BILL THEY CAN BE. TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME. SERIAL THANK- MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR I JUST WANT TO FIRST OF ALL- APPLIED YOU I THINK THE BROADER OBJECTIVE OF THIS BILL IS ONE THAT I TOTALLY SUPPORT AND I KNOW HOW- COMMITTED YOU ARE TO YOU- OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I ALSO KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN A CONCERN CAUCUS RECORD ISSUES- AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO I THINK THE BROADER INTENTION OF THIS BILL- TO BRING EVEY CHARGERS INTO MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND EACH OTHER SOME OF THESE OTHER PLACES WHERE WE WOULD PUT THEM IS A VERY LOT OF ALL AND ONE THAT I SUPPORT I GUESS WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH AND UNITE HAD. UNFORTUNATE TO BRIEF OF AN OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT THIS IS- SOME OF THE DETAILS AND I GUESS THE THINGS I'M MOST WILL HAVE MOST OF QUESTIONS ABOUT. IS HOW THIS IS DONE. THE PROCESS TO WHICH THESE THIS IS MANDATED AND THEN WHO PAYS FOR IT AND SO THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS I WANTED TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT- I'M LOOKING BACK AT THAT ARE CALLING MR LEVINE'S BILLS FROM- PRIOR SESSIONS. I NOTICED THE DAY ARE WORKING THROUGH THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AND SO. MY UNDERSTANDING. HAVING GONE INTO THIS ISSUE A LITTLE BIT IN YOU KNOW PREVIOUS. PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS WITH OUR PRIOR CHAIRS THAT- THERE WAS A THERE WAS A STRONG PREFERENCE FROM I THINK FROM OUR PRIOR CHAIR TO WORK THROUGH THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION. AND I SEE. YOU KNOW WE SEE THAT HERE IN IN IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE SO. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WHY NOT WORK. SORT OF THROUGH THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION AND WHY DO THIS THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS. WHEN THE REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED IN DECEMBER. THEY DIDN'T DO A STANDARD FOR EASY INSTALLED. AT AS POLICY MAKERS. IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT CHARGER. NO ONE AND WHO'S A RENTER AND AN APARTMENT. IS GOING TO GET IN THE V. I WANT TO GET A VVV AND I'M ONE OF THE FEW RENTERS IN THE ASSEMBLY. YOU KNOW WE- ARE NOT GONNA SPEND A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO INSTALL. A PROPER CHARGER WE USE A PLUG SO IT TAKES EIGHTEEN HOURS. TO CHARGER EVEY. RIGHT SO I LOOK AT THAT AND LIKE I CAN DO THAT BECAUSE OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WITH A BRUSH. BUT IF YOU'RE AN APARTMENT A YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY TO CHARGE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BUY EASY. AND SO WE WILL HAVE IT AND THEY DIDN'T ADOPTED. SO I'M HAPPY TO LOOK AT GOING THROUGH THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE'VE TAKEN A MOMENT SET TO MAKE IT BETTER WITH YOUR PROCESS. BUT I'M OPEN I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE PLACE AND THAT HAVE THE EEVEE INSTALLED THAT'S WHAT I WANT OKAY SORRY I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION DECLINED TO DO THAT. I ASSUME IT WAS A PROCESS OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. AND BUT IT DOES. THE REALITY IS HOW THEY GOT TO THE PLACE WHERE EVEN INSTALLED. MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WELL THAT WASN'T FUNDING SO WE HAVE THE FUNDING BILL AS I MENTIONED BEFORE- THAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO THAT COULD CHANGE THE CALCULATION. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CALCULATION. IS EVEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WHICH I KNOW IS NOT A FINAL BUDGET. THEY'RE PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY FOR EV'S IN THERE. SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THIS YEAR I THINK A COMMITMENT. FROM ALL SIDES TO ADDRESS. THE FUNDING SIDE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE THING- AND- AND I THINK THAT. WE AS POLICYMAKERS NEED TO MAKE CLEAR. THIS IS WHAT OUR OBJECTIVE IS. I AM HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE. ON ACHIEVING OUR MUTUALLY AGREED UPON GOALS YEAH I GUESS IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT HELPFUL FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION DECLINED TO DO THAT AND I. AND I SUSPECT THAT I KNOW THE REASON WHY- AND THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE IN THE ANALYSIS FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. HE TALKS ABOUT BALANCING ARCHED CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE OBJECTIVES. WITH OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT GETS TO MY SECOND CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL. WHICH IS COST BECAUSE- THIS ISN'T GONNA BE FREE RIGHT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH AND WHEN YOU PUT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND- SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR IT. AND WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT. THE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE GONNA PASS THOSE COSTS ALONG TO THE RENTER'S ALONG TO THE TENANTS. ALONG TO WHOEVER THOSE FOLKS MAY BE. AND IF THIS IF THIS ISN'T CRAFTED IN THE RIGHT WAY. YOU COULD LITERALLY END UP BECOMING A REPRESS A REGRESSIVE TAX WE COULD BE INCREASING RENTS. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD WE COULD BE INCREASING RENTS IN- IN IN MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS. IN A WAY THAT I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS AROUND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THIS IS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH IN THIS COMMITTEE I SUPPORTED A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANDATES. ON OUR NEW CONSTRUCTION. UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE DRIVING UP THE COST OF HOUSING IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT THESE ARE POLICY TRADE OFFS AND SO. WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT WE'RE JUMPING IN HERE- IT KNOWING THAT. IN ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK. AS YOU MENTIONED THIS IS A RESTRICTION THAT IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO EXPANDING IF YOU TRY. INTEREST DEEPLY COMMIT HARD BY. GOALS THIS IS A GOVERNOR THAT'S ACTUALLY TAKEN STEPS THAT ARE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ABLE TO TYPE. THEY WERE A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT DOING THIS PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT HOW WHAT IMPACT OUR HOUSING SUPPLY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO JUMP IN AND SO I'M- I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ISSUE SO TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS BECOMING A REGRESSIVE TAX. SO THIS IS NOT A REGRESSIVE TAX MR GABRIEL. AND I THINK FRAMING IT AS SUCH. YOU COULD FRAME ANY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL THINGS THAT WE DO. YOU CAN IN THE- FRAME. PUTTING SOLAR ON ROOFS AS- A REGRESSIVE TAX YOU COULD. FRAME ANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO AS A REGRESSIVE TAX I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO WERE PUTTING STORM WATER RETENTION BASINS BASINS WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAN TO PUT IN  FAST CHARGER. AND THIS BILL IS ALLOWING. MULTI FAMILY APARTMENT UNIT OWNERS. TO PARTNER WITH ALL OF OUR EVEY CHARGING COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT. BEARING THE BURDEN OF IT. RIGHT THAT WE PUT IN A LOT OF SAFEGUARDS AROUND. MY OTHER BILL THAT THE REVENUE TAX IS LOOKING AT THE GRANT PROGRAM. BECAUSE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COSTS THAT ARE GOING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT WILL TARGET ESPECIALLY. THAT TAX INCENTIVE RELIEF OR THE GRANT AND SENSE OF RELIEF PROGRAM. AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THAT BILL TOGETHER WITH THIS BILL AND THEIR THEIR THEIR COMPANION BILLS WHAT THEY'RE NOT. PHYSICALLY JOINED UP IN LANGUAGE YET BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW THE PROCESS WORKS TO DO THAT IN THE SENATE. YOU DON'T DO THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY. BUT THEY ARE. WE WROTE THEM TOGETHER WE'RE MOVING THEM FORWARD TOGETHER. AND THAT ADDRESSES YOUR ISSUE AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THOSE COSTS TO BE. PASSED ON TO THE RENTERS WHICH IS WHY THE- TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM OR THE TAX CREDIT. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. WILL BE GOING SPECIFICALLY TALKING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE STATE CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THAT BUT TO ME THAT'S NOT. TO ME WHO PAYS FOR IT IS NOT A MINOR DETAIL. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SUPPORTING THIS IS THERE SOME KIND OF AND I KNOW THAT YOU WORKED ON A TAX CREDIT IN THE COMMITTEE WASN'T IN LOVE WITH THAT IDEA SO MAYBE A GRANT PROGRAM. IF WE CAN THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND OR- OTHER MAKE. FUNDING STILL. OF THE THINGS WITH. WE CAN THAT WE ARE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR EASY CHARGING STATIONS BUT WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE COST OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ON SOME OF OUR MOST RENT BURDENED FOLKS I MEAN YOU WE ALL OF THE STUDIES WE'VE SEEN ABOUT. HOW MUCH OF PEOPLE'S INCOME RENT IS HEATING UP. LET'S WORK WITH THAT LET'S LET'S FIGURE OUT THE FUNDING MECHANISM SO THAT WE'RE DRAWING FROM. A BROADER GROUP OF FOLKS TO PAY FOR IT. RATHER THAN HAVING THOSE COSTS BE BORNE BY THE RENTERS pTHAT IS WHERE INSTRUCTORS I THINK YOU'VE HIT ON A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS NOTION IN ECONOMICS THAT SUPPLY CREATES ITS OWN DEMAND THAT YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU START INSTALLING. EVEY CHARGING STATIONS THAT WILL OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS IN MULTI FAMILY HOUSING TO BUY ELECTRIC VEHICLES I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR CLIMATE GOALS. BUT IF WE'RE ON ONE HAND. YOU KNOW DOING A LITTLE SOMETHING TO UP OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND ON THE OTHER HAND. MAKING AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WORSE. NOT SURE THAT WE'VE MADE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE IN IN IN THE WAY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT. HOW DO WE FUND THIS IN A WAY THAT WE CAN KNOW. THAT IT'S NOT IMPOSING. ADDITIONAL COSTS ON OUR MOST REDFORD FOLKS SO I THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL TODAY- YOU HAVE ASKED ME FOR A COURTESY VOTE I'M I'M- YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT DOING THAT IF THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN A AND ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. BUT I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT VERSION SO I'M GONNA I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THAT COURTESY VOTE TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORK AND YOU KNOW HOW THOUGHTFUL YOU ARE. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM YOU. THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK THESE ISSUES THAT THERE'S- A FUNDING ISSUE. RESERVE MY RIGHT ON THE FLOORTO VOTE DIFFERENTLY OF COURSE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT MR GABER. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE IS THAT ALL YOU NEED TO LOOK AT FOR THE FUNDING MECHANISM AND ANY FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAVE OR- MISS QUIRK-SILVA THAT YOU HAVE. AROUND THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT ALL THAT SO THAT WAS ALL GOING THERE. WE DECIDED VERY STRATEGICALLY TO PUT. THAT THERE AND THEN THIS IS THIS IS A HOUSING AND THAT THAT WAS THE EASY BILL RIGHT. WE TALKED ABOUT DO WE DO IT ALL TOGETHER. IT WOULD GET TROUBLE REFERRED. IT'S SO EASY TO KILL SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT WE'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER SO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE. I'LL MAKE SURE MY FOR EFFORT TO THAT YOURSELF CAN. MAYBE GO HAVE A- TALK ABOUT. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE COMMERCE. AND I ALSO THINK THAT THAT THINKING THROUGH. AND UNDERSTOOD. WHY THE BUILDINGS. CAN LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE. ARRIVED AT A DIFFERENT. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT US TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF THEIR DETERMINATION WISE. WE FEEL REALLY STRONGLY ABOUT CLIMATE WE'RE GONNA PUT A TON OF MONEY TV THIS YEAR BUT WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPONENT. I WANT UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THEN MAYBE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO CRAFT A BETTER BELL. YOU CAN REMOVE ALL OF THIS OPPOSITION AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL FEEL GOOD ABOUT. I ALWAYS WANT TO BETTER BILL MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU. SORRY MIT CONCERNS ARE SIMILAR- THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS LIKE HIM TO GO FIRST. A VERY ELOQUENT AND- STADIUMS. HOWEVER I HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A- DIFFERENT SPIN ON THIS. FOR ME WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS. ADVANCING IN MARKET BEFORE IT'S OF IT IF. IT'S READY- THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOMES AND- AFFORDABLE APARTMENT. THEY THEY CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF OWNING. AN EEVEE. AND YET WHAT THIS IS DOING IS ADVANCINGJUSTICE THAT'S GOING TO BE IMMEDIATELY PASSED ALONG TO THEM SPECIFICALLY. AS IT. IS A COST SHARING FOR IS IT IT'S A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY APARTMENT BUILDING. ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE SHARING IN THE COSTS. OF EVEY THAT ONLY MAYBE TEN PEOPLE ARE USING. AND THIS IS THE CONCEPT OF HAVING THEM BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO THE BUILDING IS SOMEWHAT LIKE FILES WAS WAY BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND. WHEN I THINK HUNTINGTON BEACH IS THE FIRST CITY. THAT HAD FILES PUT IN. THEY PUT IT IN UP TO THE SERVICE. THE UP TO THE STREET. UP TO THE THIS WHAT THE SERVICE ADDRESS. BUT IT WAS UP TO THE CUSTOMER TO DO THE REST OF IT. AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT EVENT. WILL HAPPEN IS. MARKET WILL FORCE. OF THE- PEOPLE WHO OWN. THE BUILDINGS TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT. OF PARTICULAR PEOPLE ARE STARTING DECLINE TO RENT OR PAY THE RENTS WE ARE ARE CHARGING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE VIS AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY V. PLACE FOR THEM AND THAT'S THE POINT AT WHICH THEY START ADDING THOSE ON AND THEY CAN THEY CAN ADD THOSE ON AND BE PART OF THE RANT- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WILL BE RIGHT WE KEEP IMPACTING THE VERY THING THAT WE'RE TRYING INCREASING THE COSTS FOR THE FOR THE VIVID UP POINT BUILDING OF SOMETHING THAT MAKES THE OF RENTS AND THE COST OF HOMES UNAFFORDABLE- IF I'M NOT GOING TO OWN AN EEVEE UNTIL I ABSENT TELL MY- CAR DIES. WHICH IS GOING TO HAPPEN- ARE YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR HER T. V. STATION IT'S SITTING IN MY GARAGE AND HANG IN THERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND USED- AND I THINK IT'S BETTER TO LET THE MARKET. ADVANCED HIS GOALS. IN WILL OF BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A LOT OF CAN'T EVEN AFFORD AN EEVEE AND THEY WON'T FOR A LONG TIME AND- SO UNTIL THAT MARKET COMES INTO PLAY I THINK WE'RE WE'RE IMPACTING THE LOW THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PART OF THIS FAR MORE CHEN WERE MAKING A DENT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PART OF IT SO THAT'S WHERE I WENT ON AND IF I CAN RESPOND TO THAT SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE MARKET IS BUILDING EV'S. RAN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS AND UPPER CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY CITY WHEN I KNEW ABOUT DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR AUTOMATICALLY INSTALLING ATVS YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT ANTI ONE INVESTOR THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT OF SOME PARTS OF OCEANSIDE AND THAT'S NOT DOING THAT. BECAUSE THE- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A TO DO IT AND THERE'S NO AND TO DO AND SO IF WE WAIT FOR THE MARKET TO DO AT TO DECIDE WHEN LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO EV'S WE ARE EXACERBATING EXISTING INEQUITIES AND STATE AND I THINK I KNOW AND WE MADE THIS DISAGREE ON THIS- I THINK THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT SO MUCH ON THIS BILL IS BECAUSE- IT AND IT'S NOT LIKE OVERNIGHT SOMEBODY HAS TO BUILD US RIGHT WE WENT NEXT AND- THE NEXT CYCLE SO NOT INTERVIEW. CYCLEWITH THE NAY THING MONTHS WE TOOK I'M- PLEASE BECAUSE IT WILL BE AS YOU TO I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT MOST MORE MULTI FAMILY APARTMENTS THEY DON'T PICK UP THE PARKING LOT VERY OFTEN IT'S NOT LIKE THEY DID HAVE A PARKING LOT USUALLY MOST MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPERS WILL AVOID ANYTHING THAT TRIGGERS THE STORM WATER RETENTION BASIN REQUIREMENTS THE PARKING LOTS AND SO THEY WILL AVOID DEVELOPING BEYOND THAT UNLESS THERE IS A MARKET INCENTIVE TO DO SO THE MORE THEY WANT TO DO THIS UNLESS THERE WAS A MORE SENSITIVE SO IT TRIGGER FOR THIS IT MEANT TO BE GRADUAL SO THAT WE- GET TO THE PLACE. THAT BY TWO WE DO HAVE AN EXPANSIVE NETWORK AND WE'RE BEING INCLUSIVE OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IT AND RENTERS I THINK THIS IS MORE ABOUT RENTERS AND LOW INCOME THE MORE OF THE MIDDLE- AND FROM SOUTH WITH I APPRECIATE YOUR POSITION AND MAYBE HOW A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT THAT ACTUAL YOU CAN ANSWER ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THAT HIGHER AND MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD EV'S AND THAT'S WHY IT HAPPENED AND BUILT THEIR WHEREAS THE OTHER. COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE CAN AFFORD THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT THEY'RE AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT I MEAN I CAN NO MORE EASY CHARGERS AND HIGHER INCOME AND THEY'RE PUTTING THEM IN PUBLIC SPACES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE FEW THAT THERE ARE BUT AS THEIR BECOME MORE MORE I SAID IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX THAT'S BEING BUILT IF THAT'S ONE OF THE DETERMINING FACTORS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING RUN WHEN I. THE MORE AS WHAT WE BETTER START PUTTING IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT'LL ACCOMMODATE THOSE PEOPLE NOT NOT ONE FOR EVERY UNIT I'M NOT ASKING FOR WHEN I KNOW YOU'RE NOT I KNOW I'M JUST SAYING THAT IT'S EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT THANK YOU FOR IS ON THE WAY I APPRECIATE IT WORK WITH YOU WE ARE AND WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A PLACE OF AGREEMENT RIGHT THANK.

FIFTY THANK YOU MATT CHAIR AND MEMBERS VERY- INTO. IT'S A REAL AND- TODAY AND PER MY L. ACTIVE WHICH IS A UP TO AB EIGHT FIVE FOUR EARLIER IN THE YEAR WHERE PRE VERSIONS OF BILL PASSED OUT OF THIS AND ON THE S. FOR JANUARY. THE BILL SEEKS TO PER SPEC FICTION BY REQUIRE FIVE YEARS A PROP OWNERS BEFORE THE ALSO CAN BE IN THE IN GETTING FIVE YEARS FROM THE TIME THAT AND BY WHETHER BE FIFTY FIVE WHICH THOUSAND FOR. THE L. SECTOR ORIGINALLY TO ALLOW MOM AND POP LANDLORDS LEAVE THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS WITH DOUBTS ON THE PROPERTY I RECRUITING A FIVE YEAR HOLDING PERIOD. BEFORE DIAZ THAT CAN BE INVOKED. ARBIL CONTINUES RESPECT LONG TERM LANDLORDS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR DECADES IN THIS VERSION OF THE BILL WE HAVE PUT FORWARD AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFIED AT THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO MAY MANAGE THEIR PROPERTY WITH AN LLC OR TRUST. THE EXEMPTION APPLIES IF THE OWNER IS THE NATURAL PERSON THE OWNERS LLC MADE ENTIRELY OF NATURAL PERSONS THE OWNER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWNS NO MORE THAN FOUR RESIDENTIAL UNITS IN THE AGGRGATE INCLUDING OR EXCLUDING THEIR PERSONAL PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS O PREVENT THE ABUSE OF PROPERTY SPECULATORS FROM MOVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS FOR PROFIT. IF AB TWENTY FIFTEEN SIGNED INTO LAW LATER THIS YEAR ANYONE WHO HAS OWNED A PROPERTY FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND PRIOR CAN STILL USE THE ELLIS ACT EXIT THE RENTAL BUSINESS TOO OFTEN MANY TENANTS IN THE RENT STABILIZED UNITS LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR THAT THEY'RE BUILDING WILL BE SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. CAN BE SUBJECT TO AN EVICTION SHOW AFTER PASSING THIS BILL UP CRUCIAL STABILISING EFFECT WHEN RENTERS WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY THAT A NEW OWNER IS GOING TO EVICT THEM WITHIN MONTHS OF CLOSING ESCROW. SINCE 200-012-7000 SIX HUNDRED TEN UNITS IN LOS ANGELES ALONE HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE RENTAL MARKET USING THE RENTS USING THE ALSO ACT DISPLACING OVER SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. CONTINUED ABUSE OF ELSE ACT DOES NOT PRODUCE HOUSING IT PRODUCES DISPLACEMENT AND WORSENS OUR HOUSING CRISIS BY LOVING REAL ESTATE SPECULATORS A PROFIT MOTIVE TO REMOVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THERE ARE I'M PRESIDENT HOUSING CRISIS WE MUST IN. DEFENSIVE MEASURE AGAINST PLACE AND HOMELESSNESS. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TO IS A- RAIL. MORE OF ACTIONS AND MORE PEOPLE LOSING THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. AND INCLUDES AMENDMENTS FROM CONCERNS I'VE HEARD FROM OTHER MEMBERS THROUGH THE PROCESS. SHORTLY AFTER I VOTE AND TODAY AND JOIN IN PERSON BY BRIAN AUGUSTA FROM THE C. R. L. A. FOUNDATIONS. GOOD MORNING TERM MEMBERS TRYING TO GUEST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION- ZERILLI FOUNDATION AND OUR COLLEAGUES WESTERN CENTER. AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. INTERNALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE ELLIS ACT RIGHT TELL US. THE PROPONENTS OF THE ELLIS ACT. CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE MANY YEARS AGO AND SAID. LOCAL REGULATIONS AND THE NATIONAL CASE PREVENT US FROM GOING OUT OF THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS AND WANT TO EXIT. THE BUSINESS EFFECT- INTO THE BUILDING AND CHANGE ITS USE. ABNETT WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY DOESN'T CHANGE THAT THAT THAT IS STILL THERE RIGHT. AND THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS. CAN STILL DO THAT AND IN FACT- THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED IN THIS VERSION OF THE BILL. FOCUS ON ONE OF THE- CRITICS THAT WE HEARD IN THE LAST ROUND WHICH WAS THAT. SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS MOM AND POP. A FAMILIES WHO WANT TO BUY RENTAL PROPERTY AND MOVE MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS AND WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM DOING SO THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT BY CREATING THAT EXEMPTION. SO WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY TARGETING IS- SPECULATORS. WHO HAD NO INTENTION OF EVER BEING IN THE REAL HOUSING BUSINESS THEY PURCHASED AN ONGOING RENTAL HOUSING- PROPERTY AND IMMEDIATELY ACCESS THE ELLIS ACT TO. PREEMPT LOCAL EVICTION PROTECTIONS EFFECT ALL OF THE TENANTS. AND CHANGE THE USE OF THE BUILDING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THIS BILL TO PUT AN END TO THE SPECULATORS THE SERIAL VICTORS. WHO WHO ARE ABUSING THE ELLIS ACT AND CAUSING. ENORMOUS HARM IN OUR CITIES AMONG. THE MOST VULNERABLE RIGHT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND ALL THE RE THAT THE AUTHORS TO WE WOULD AND I.

GOOD MORNING AND THE MEDICINE FOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE PROVIDE WOULD SPEAK THIS MORNING. SORRY THE BETTER THANK YOU CAA'S HERE OPPOSING AB TWENTY FIFTY AS IT IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO AB EIGHT FIFTY FOUR WHICH WAS UNSUCCESSFUL JUST EARLIER THIS YEAR. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE AUTHORS EFFORT TO LIMIT THE APPLICATION OF AB TWENTY FIFTY VERSUS THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL THE REVISIONS TO THE DEFINITION OF A PROPERTY OWNER STILL WOULD FOR SMALL RENTAL OWNERS TO STAY IN BUSINESS WHEN THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO DO SO. THIS BILL IS NOT THE SOLUTION OUR STATE NEEDS OR ITS HOUSING CRISIS INSTEAD OF UNNECESSARILY PLACING LIMITS ON EXISTING RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS WE LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING LEGISLATION THAT INCREASES CALIFORNIA SUPPLY RENTAL HOUSING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU AND ANY OTHER- FOLKS IN THE ROOM WHEN I REGISTER OPPOSITION PLEASE NAME AN ORGANIZATION A POSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS PAT MORAN WITHIN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THE SAME REASON TO CA THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. NO OKAY WE'LL BRING IT BACK HERE TO THE COMMITTEE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER WARD BURNING QUESTION HERE. SO YOUR OWN APARTMENT FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AND YOU DECIDE YOU YOU'RE DONE WITH A AND YOU HAVE A FEW OF THEM- SAY TEN UNIT APARTMENT BUILDING. AND DAY SO YOU DECIDE THAT YOU NO LONGER WANT TO BE IN THE BUSINESS SO YOU'RE GOING TO SELL THAT APARTMENT BUILDING AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT PERSON THAT BUYS IT CAN'T. IS LIMITED ON WHAT THEY CAN DO AS FAR AS RANCID SECTOR CONCERNED RENOVATING THE BUILDING. CORRECT FOR FIVE YEARS. SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IF I WERE A PROPERTY OWNER WHO ATTEND UNITS AND THEN I SOLD IT TO SOMEONE ELSE THAT NEW PERSON COULD NOT USE THE L. SACK TO MASSIVE ECHT EVERYONE WITHIN THE FIVE YEARS OF LYING THAT. HE CAN STILL RENOVATED THEY CAN STILL DO ON A MOVE INS WHICH IS UNDER FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WITH THE PREVIOUS. A BIG LEGISLATION BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS WHEN THAT OWNERSHIP CHANGES HANDS ESPECIALLY FOR A LONG TIME OWNER OF A TEN YEAR APARTMENT- THAT TEN UNIT APARTMENT IS GOING TO COST A WHOLE. MORE IN THERE FOR THE MONEY THAT- A IT TAKES TO MAINTAIN THAT. IS GOING TO CHANGE- YOU KNOW THE IN OTHER WORDS. YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE THE MARKET UP FOR. PEOPLE BUYING APARTMENT BUILDINGS. AND DAD AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE INTERFERING IN THE MARKET LIKE THAT- I THINK- MAY. DAY I THINK IS GOING DOWN A ROAD. THAT IS. BEING WAY TOO RESTRICTIVE ON PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST TRY THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING TILL. AND ANDERSTON- THE RENT CONTROL BUT YOU KNOW. PEOPLE THAT ARE RENTING HAVE LEASES- THAT ARE USUALLY ONE YEAR. OR ONTH TO MONTH. AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT SITUATION THEN WE NEED TO THAT EITHER THEY CAN GIVE ENTERED LONGER LEASES. OR OR THE YOU KNOW THE- STATE THEY LIVE IN RENT CONTROL AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING IMPOSED ON ON. THE RENTER ITSELF. YEAH I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHERE THIS BILL IS HEADED OUR WAY THIS ACT WITH THIS APPROACH IS HEADED IN TERMS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS- AND- THE MARKET. ITSELF BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT MARKET IS WHAT TAKES A RUN DOWN APARTMENT BUILDING. AND RENOVATED AND TURNED IT INTO A- MUCH BETTER- LIVIA LIVABLE UNITS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT- I MEMBER ONE COMMITTEE MEETING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THE NEED FOR EVERY UNIT TO HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. WELL A LOT OF THE OLD ONES DON'T ESPECIALLY THE ONES DOWN IN THE SOUTH BAY AREA THAT HAVE THE- DID FAVORABLE CLIMATE. IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE A AID OVERTURNED DO THEY HAVE TO OVERTURN THE PROPERTY OR TURN THE PROPERTY OVER. AND IN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS ESSENTIALLY THAT PERSON WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS- BECAUSE IT AND THE PEOPLE HAVE TO MOVE OUT. AND OVER THERE AND THEY CAN RATE YOU KNOW THEY CAN READ JUST AS JUST AS THE RENT TO GO TO MORE OF A MARKET RATE THAT WILL. WILL HELP OFFSET THE COSTS OF ACQUISITION FOR THAT BUILDING. AND END WITHOUT OF A CLEAR- IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MARKET IN THAT SPACE IT'S KIND OF HARD TO COME UP STILL HARD FOR ME TO- TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. MR WARD. THANK YOU CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BACK AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING REALLY HARD ON A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO. AVOID DISPLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS- I THINK WELL I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW SOME PERSPECTIVE IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS LET'S REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER CHOICES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ACTUALLY GO TO. IF THEY CHOOSE TO AND THAT ONE YEAR LEASE OR THE OR THEY ARE ARE ARE ARE. COMPELLED TO BE AFFECTED- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH AS WELL AND SO. THIS IS A BILL THAT IS REALLY SENDING THOSE JUST BOUNDARIES GOING FORWARD. AND THEY'RE ALREADY RENT CONTROLLED APARTMENTS RIGHT THAT FACT ISN'T CHANGING- YOU ARE IF THIS WERE TO BECOME LAW BASICALLY CLARIFYING WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO FOR THAT GOING FORWARD FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS SO. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A CHOICE AS THE PURCHASER- WHETHER OR NOT- UNDER THOSE TERMS THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO YOU THAT THE CHOICE IS STILL THERE- BUT THE IMPORTANT THING TO MAKE SURE THAT UNDER VERY. VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE HAVE TODAY IS THAT WE'RE PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM. THAT KIND OF DISPLACEMENT RIGHT NOW AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK WITH MEMBERS- AND WITH OPPOSITION AS WELL TO TRY TO FIND TO THIS BILL AS YOU BROUGHT IT BACK FOR- TO WORK ON NOT. LIMITING IT TO THE EXEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN SMALL- SMALL. MONOPOD OWNERS- DEFINING WHAT AN ACTUAL PERSON IS THAT'S ALWAYS A TRICKY LEGAL- ISSUE- BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE TELLING THIS IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS VERY HELPFUL TO SET THOSE BOUNDARIES- SO THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE- IS REALIZE FOR INDIVIDUALS. THAT NEED. THANK YOU FOR THAT MANAGED TO BE. THE MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU TO HAVE A SECOND ON THAT MOST. BY MISTER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE BILL BACK AGAIN I KNOW YOU'VE- A LOT OF WORK INTO IT YOU'VE NARROWED IT- HOPEFULLY GET SOME MORE VOTES WHEN WE REACH THE FLOOR- BUT I'M OPPOSITION I RECOMMENDATION SAYING PRECIADO WORK.

NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOMES TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE LOW INCOMES AND THAT METRO AREA. THESE HOMES HELP STABILIZE HOMEOWNERSHIP GREAT HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. AND LIKE I SAID PROVIDE AFFORDABLE RENTAL OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE WHO GET THEM. THIS BILL MAKES SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTS MUST RETURN A COMPLETE SET OF COMMENTS. I TO AN EIGHTY PROPONENT WITHIN THE TIMELINE OF EXISTING LAW. CLARIFIES THAT ALL RELEVANT PERMITTING AGENCIES MUST RETURN THESE COMMENTS AND MORE CLEARLY ENUMERATE THE ITEMS TO LOCAL AGENCIES CANNOT CANNOT REQUIRE OF A PROJECT APPROVED UNDER SUBDIVISION E.

FOR AND THE BILL IS OUT. JUST TO NON CONTRA BILL FROM OKAY. OKAY LET'S SEE- LET'S MOVE ON TO MAN CHAIR MEMBER IT'S NICE TO BE BACK. TO THE COMMITTEE- AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY THREE WILL BREAK DOWN SILOS BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING AND MEDICARE PROGRAMS 45% OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS NESS IN CALIFORNIA ARE FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER. MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE PROGRAMS SUCH AS PACE RAIL W. THE PROVIDE SERVICES TO HELP PEOPLE LIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN HOUSING INSTEAD OF AN LICENSE CARE SETTINGS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO CREATING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THESE POPULATIONS IS LACK OF FUNDING. AB TWENTY FORTY THREE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES. IN THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM TO DEVELOPMENTS THAT SET ASIDE A PERCENTAGE OF UNITS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RECEIVING SPECIFIED MEDICAL SERVICES. THIS BILL WILL INCENTIVIZE CREATION OF HOUSING THAT WILL HELP SENIORS EXIT HOMELESSNESS ENABLE THEM TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY WITH SUPPORT RATHER THAN A LICENSE SETTING. WITH ME TODAY AND SUPPORT IS TRICIA LEVINE FROM WAKELAND HOUSING. AND MAYBE OTHERS YES THE SHERIN HERE TO THANK YOU YOU MAY BEGIN. AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS TRICIA TASKER LEVINE AND I WORK AS A DIRECTOR OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR WAKELAND HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. A LEADING NONPROFIT DEVELOPER OF AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. WAKELIN HAS THREE DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COMPREHENSIVE PAY SERVICES- A SORRY EXCUSE ME- SO WE'VE DEVELOPED- MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED AFFORDABLE HOMES AT FIFTY THREE PROPERTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WAKELIN IS A LEADER IN DEVELOPING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR UN HOUSED OLDER ADULTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PAYS PROGRAM PROGRAM OF ALL INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY. WE HAVE THREE DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN COMPREHENSIVE PAYS SERVICES TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FORMALLY ON HOUSED MEDICALLY FRAIL OLDER ADULTS. ARE WARD WINNING TALMADGE GATEWAY PROJECT OPEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I WAS THE FIRST PROJECT IN SAN DIEGO DEDICATED SOLELY TO HOUSING HOMELESS FRAIL OLDER ADULTS. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE WE OPENED TO OTHER SUPPORT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN SAN DIEGO DEDICATED TO ON HOUSED OLDER ADULTS. THE PACE SERVICES OFFERED ONSITE AND OFFSITE PROVIDE THE RESIDENTS WITH SERVICES THAT ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT AND AGE IN PLACE. THE PAY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. BY MEDIC COW AND COST THE PROJECT NOTHING THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE HOUSING AND HEALTH PARTNERSHIP THAT BENEFITS RESIDENTS HOUSING OPERATORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS WE BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN THIS MODEL THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING FOR SIMILAR PROJECTS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND SEVERAL MORE THROUGHOUT SAN DIEGO COUNTY LEVERAGING MEDIC HOW FUNDED PACE TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. TO OUR TENANTS THESE ARE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT TYPICALLY PROVIDED IN MOST SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THESE PROJECTS ARE SEEN AS A NATIONAL MODEL AND HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AT THE NATIONAL AND STATE LEVEL FOR THE INNOVATIVE COMBINATION OF PACE WITH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. DESPITE OUR SUCCESSES BARRIER STILL IN. CAL PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING MEDIC HOW FUNDED PROVIDERS INCLUDING PACE PROVIDERS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH DEVELOPERS THAT CREATE INDEPENDENT HOUSING OR SIDELOAD WHICH PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE CLIENTS TO NAVIGATE THESE PROGRAMS SEPARATELY. LASTLY MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDING PAYS OFTEN EXCLUDE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FROM PROGRAMS DUE TO FEDERAL RULES REQUIRING THAT THEY RECEIVE SERVICES AND HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS. FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY WHAT STRONGLY SUPPORTS AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY THREE WHICH WOULD RESOLVE THESE BARRIERS BY OFFERING DEVELOPERS INCENTIVES TO CREATE A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. FOR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THE BILL WILL PROMOTE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN DEVELOPERS AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS BY OFFERING INCENTIVES AND ALIGNING PROGRAM ELIGIBLE. ELIGIBILITY I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SECOND WITNESS.

AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY SIX PROVIDES TO VOLUNTARY OPTIONS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FIRST AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY SIX WILL PROVIDE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH 50% OF THE VALUE OF THE OF THE FEE REDUCTION GRANTED TO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT SECONDLY IT ALSO ALLOWS JURISDICTIONS TO DEFERRED FEES UNTIL THE HOUSING PROJECT IS CONVERTED TO PERMANENT FINANCING THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- BECAUSE IT IT DOES INCLUDE INTEREST TO BE CHARGED WITH THE STATE WILL BACK FILL THAT INTEREST AFFECTIVELY PROVIDING DEVELOPERS WITH A ZERO INTEREST LOAN. ENSURING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE MADE WHOLE IN OTHER WORDS THE DEVELOPER WILL HAVE TO FINANCE THE IMPACT FEES- WHICH HELPS BRING DOWN COSTS AND WITH THE STATE PICKING UP THE INTEREST SIDE OF IT KEEPS THE COST AT A MINIMUM FOR THE STATE IT MAKES THE PROJECT- PENCIL OUT FOR THE DEVELOPER EVERYBODY WINS THIS IS A WIN WIN WIN WIN FOR THE DEVELOPER WHEN FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTION AS A WIN FOR THE RENTER OR THE- NEW HOMEOWNER OF THAT PARTICULAR PROPERTY WITH THAT I DO HAVE WITNESSES THAT CAN SELF INCIDENTS. RIGHT MARKET DRIVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AND EVEN THOUGH THIS BILL CREATES A NEW PROGRAM IT ACTUALLY SAVES THE STATE MONEY- THE STATE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT HOUSING RIGHT NOW IS PAYING THESE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES WITH LARGER LOANS THROUGH ITSMULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM AND IF WE CAN GET LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SHARE IN REDUCING THE COST OF THOSE FEES WHILE AND THE STATE JUST REIMBURSING THIS WELCOME HALF OF THAT AMOUNT THE STATE CAN ACTUALLY HAS MORE FUNDS IN ITS MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM TO BUILD ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THIS ACTUALLY IS A WIN WIN WIN.

JUST TO HELP GRASP THE NEED AND I WILL BRIEFLY MAKE THIS COMMENT AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO. MY STAR WITNESSES OF FAIR MARKET RENT IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HARD TO ESTIMATE OF MEDIAN RENTS FOR LOOK AT NON LUXURY APARTMENT.

SSI INCREASED FROM SEVEN HUNDRED TWELVE DOLLARS A MONTH IN TWENTY TWENTY. TWO THE ONLY A THOUSAND FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO GIVEN THOSE DISPARITIES. IT'S EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR OLDER ADULTS ON FIXED INCOME TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN AND HOLD THEIR- RENTAL PROPERTIES SO WITH THAT WITH ME TODAY.

THANK YOU HE MAY BEGIN IN TWO MINUTES EACH PLACE THANK YOU- CHAIR WICKS IN THE COMMITTEE- WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SEVEN. WE KNOW THAT OLDER LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING OUT PRICED FROM THEIR RENTAL UNITS EIGHT INTEN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME OLDER RENTERS. ARE PAYING MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME RENT FOR RENT. AND CALIFORNIANS AGE FIFTY AND OLDER ARE THE FASTEST GROWING AGE GROUP EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NOW COMPRISING 45% OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL WITH STARK RACIAL DISPARITIES- BLACK ADULTS ARE FIVE TIMES AT GREATER RISK OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAN WHITE CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL PROVIDES- A KEY GOAL OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING TO PREVENT AN AND OLDER ADULT HOMELESSNESS. AND IT WOULD ALSO- ADDRESS ANOTHER AT RISK POPULATION ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. ESTABLISHING A MULTI YEAR RENT STABILIZATION FUND TO PROVIDE RENTAL SUBSIDIES WHO ARE AT IMMINENT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS OR CURRENTLY ON HOUSING AND IT WOULD ENABLE TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RENTER HOUSEHOLDS ANNUALLY. TO ACCESS OR KEEP THEIR HOUSING- IT IS SO IMPORTANT THE WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN DOING TO PROVIDE PIPELINE FOR NEW HOUSING BUT UNLESS WE STAUNCH. THE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING INTO HOMELESSNESS WE ARE AILING A LEAKY SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND HOPE WE CAN. WORK TOGETHER ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ERIN CARUTHERS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE SERVED IN OUR STATE THROUGH A MEDICAID WAIVER CALL HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT WAIVER IS AS THE NAME DESCRIBES TO SET THE PEOPLE CAN BE SERVED IN THEIR HOMES OR IN THE COMMUNITIES IN OUT OF INSTITUTIONS THIS IS A WONDERFUL PROGRESS REMOVING PEOPLE OUT OF INSTITUTIONS- BUT ONE PIECE ABOUT IT IS THAT THE- DOLLARS ONLY SERVE. SUPPORT SERVICES- THEY DON'T SERVE ACTUAL FUNDING FOR HOUSING- SO WELL THERE IS A PUSH BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PEOPLE TO BE SERVED IN THE COMMUNITIES- THERE ISN'T FUNDING FOR THE HOUSING TO GO WITH IT THIS BILL WILL GET A LONG WAYS IN CLOSING THAT GAP. THE WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT 68% OF ADULTS OF REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS- ARE LIVING AT HOME WITH AGING CARE GIVERS SO WE SEE THIS INTERSECTION BETWEEN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND AGING- AND THERE'S A QUESTION THAT MANY FAMILIES US THAT ASK THEMSELVES WHICH IS WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME- WHAT pSOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME.
