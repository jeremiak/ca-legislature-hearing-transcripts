A DANGER TO OTHERS BECAUSE-

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.559
WE'RE HAVING INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.727

WE'RE- KIND OF THE KIND OF COME

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.278
TO THE CONCLUSION AS A LAY

REIMBURSEMENTS- THE CARE HOMES

SYSTEM THESE INDIVIDUALS.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:10.843
BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME

COUNTIES WILLING TO STEP UP TO

THE CURRENT- SITUATION INSTEAD

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:21.387
OF JUST LETTING PEOPLE DIE ON

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.489
OUR STREETS LA COUNTY IS LOSING

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.491
THREE PEOPLE A DAY ON AVERAGE.

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:26.392
THAT ARE HOMELESS ON THE

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.295
STREETS. SO I BRING THIS OUT OF

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:29.829
A SOME KIND OF EXPERIENCE

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:34.400
MISTER CHAIR. WHEN WE HAD A

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.103
SCHIZOPHRENIC HOMELESS PERSON-

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.671
KILLED IN FULLERTON BY THE NAME

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:42.608

SHOULD HAVE ADOPTED LORES LAW

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.579
SO I WORKED WITH SENATOR

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:49.115
STEINBERG AND WE DID SB FIVE

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.883

GOT ME UP HERE A LOT AND HAD A

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:54.086
LOT OF FUN WORKING ON IT- BUT

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.955
IT WAS APPROVED BY THE

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.656
LEGISLATURE SIGNED BY GOVERNOR

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.692
BROWN AND IT PROVIDED A LITTLE

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.527
BIT OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:04.630
ACT FUNDING- PROP SIXTY THREE

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:06.565
TO FUND FOR LORDS LOS ORANGE

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:07.800
COUNTY BECAME THE SECOND COUNTY

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.302
AFTER NEVADA COUNTY. AND NOW WE

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:10.870
HAD SEVENTEEN COUNTIES THAT

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:12.705
HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT. JUST HAD A

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.607
RECENT STUDY THAT SAID THAT

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:15.741
THAT'S ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:17.243
TREATMENT PROGRAM IS NOT ONLY

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.211
WORKING WELL IN THOSE NINETEEN

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:20.579
COUNTIES. BUT WHY AREN'T THE

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.281
OTHER. THIRTY NINE COUNTIES

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.949

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.852
THING SO WE HAVE SOME SUCCESS.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:29.021
SO THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS SPACE

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:31.690
MISTER CHAIR- BECAUSE I THINK

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.459
THIS SB SIX FORTY PROVIDES A

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:37.163
SIMILAR. STRATEGY WE WOULDN'T

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:37.763
LEAVE SOMEONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.232
OUT ON THE STREET. BUT THIS

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:44.203

SEVENTY TWO HOURS SO IN A

TEMPORARY INVOLUNTARY HOLD IS

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:20.739
MORE BENEFICIAL THAN

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.241

00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:02.754
RESOURCES TO START LOOKING AT-

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.990
BOTH HOUSING. AND SERVICES FOR

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:06.858
INDIVIDUALS THAT'S BEEN OUR

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.326
POSITION ALL ALONG ON THIS IS

00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:10.095
LET'S PUT THE NOT PUT THE CART

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.064
BEFORE THE HORSE LET'S FOCUS ON

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.066
MAKING SURE WE GOT SERVICES IN

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:18.403
PLACE- FOR- FOR INDIVIDUALS-

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.105
BEFORE DOING ANY TINKERING

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:24.943
WITH- THE STATUTORY-

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.413
DEFINITION. I WILL JUST ONE

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.815
YEAH BECAUSE THIS VERSION OF

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:31.049
THE BILL NOW INCLUDES THIS

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:31.950
OPTION- FOR COUNTY STOPPED IN

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.552
AND OUT IN THAT WOULD PUT US IN

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:36.321
AN EXTRAORDINARILY- DIFFERENT

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:37.656
POSITION THAN WE HAVE BEEN

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:38.990
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COURSE OF

00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:41.126
LPS WHERE. WE'VE BEEN STRIVING

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.394
TO UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT THE

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.964
STATE- IN APPLICATION OF LPS-

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:49.000
YOU WOULD HAVE COUNTIES- RIGHT

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:51.770
NEXT TO EACH OTHER POTENTIALLY-

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:53.205
EMPLOYING DIFFERENT STANDARDS

00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:55.440
FOR- DETERMINING WHETHER A

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:57.843
PERSON SHOULD BE INVOLUNTARILY

00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:59.611
HELD AND AGAIN THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:00.879
IS ALL ABOUT IS THE CIVIL

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:02.981
RIGHTS WE THINK. LPS AS HAS

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:05.150
BEEN FOR THE DECADES THAT WE'VE

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:08.653
HAD IT- REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.223
IN CONTINUING ON THE BALANCE

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.791
BETWEEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS F

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.760
INDIVIDUALS AND THE NEED TO

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:17.596
PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND-

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:20.398
OTHERS. AND SO AGAIN WE WOULD

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:22.167
SUGGEST THAT THE CONVERSATION

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.102
SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:26.605
RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS OPPOSED

00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:27.539
TO TRYING TO SWEEP MORE PEOPLE

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:29.641
INTO A SYSTEM THAT WE KNOW IS

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:31.877

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:46.958
CREATE ADDITIONAL CONFUSION ON

THERE. THEY CAN'T TALK AND THEY

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:49.581
HAVE NO AWARENESS OF WHO THEY

00:30:49.647 --> 00:30:51.783
ARE WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.117
IT'S JUST CRUEL TO LEAVE THEM

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:55.486
OUT ON THE STREET. AND YOU

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:57.121

SITUATIONS WHERE THEY CAN GET

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:04.996

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:20.578
HAPPEN AND- YOU KNOW WE TALK

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:22.413
ABOUT DEATH LIKE I SAID NINE

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.214
HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE PEOPLE

ON THE STREET OR IN JAIL. I

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:45.470
THINK ALTERING LANGUAGE. ERR.

TO HAVE HOMELESSNESS INCREASE

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.655
AND NOT DO ANYTHING FOR

00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:05.189
SOLUTIONS WE CAN'T JUST THROW

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:07.158
MONEY AT IT WOULD YOU HOUSING

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:07.992
FIRST WHICH EVERYBODY THOUGHT

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:10.295
THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA BUT YOU

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.462
PUT PEOPLE IN HOUSING INITIALLY

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.531

THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS NOT CAPABLE

00:33:20.598 --> 00:33:21.432

NO WAY TO HELP THESE PEOPLE IN

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:31.476
OF CHANGING A SMALL BIT OF

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:34.445
LANGUAGE IN A SECTION OF CODE

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:36.381

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:05.076
BILL NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:10.014
WORK- HOWEVER I A. IT YOU KNOW

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:11.716
I READ AN ARTICLE RECENTLY FROM

00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:14.185
THAT AN OP ED FROM A MOTHER AND

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:16.587
MY DISTRICT ARE AND I KNOW THAT

00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:18.489
THE HOMELESS ISSUE WAS BROUGHT

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.391
UP BUT I KIND OF I'M THINKING

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.894
OF THIS BILL IN A DIFFERENT-

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.196
WAY I'M THINKING AND I WANT TO

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:26.831
SHARE A COUPLE LINES THAT THE

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.900
THAT THE MOM SHARED ABOUT. HER

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:32.503
EXPERIENCE. SHE WROTE- HE SAT

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.372
ON THE TRAIN TRACK AND HE WAS

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:36.374
PRAYING WHEN HE DIED. AND IT

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:39.043
WAS THE HARDEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.445
THOSE ARE TEARS NO PARENT EVER

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:43.414
WANTS TO SHED. AND HEARTBREAK

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:44.015
NO MOTHER OR FATHER EVER WANTS

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:48.453
TO FEEL. HE WAS TWENTY FOUR

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:50.521
YEARS OLD AT THIS HAPPENED

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:52.490
ABOUT A HERE AND- FIVE MONTHS

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:55.927
AGO- HE BATTLED WITH

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:57.662
SCHIZOPHRENIA. AND SUBSTANCE

00:34:57.728 --> 00:35:00.431
ABUSE. AND HE HAD A HOME HE WAS

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:03.468
AN HOMELESS I THINK THAT- THAT

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:05.002
WE REALLY DISCARDED PINK AND

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:07.738
FOCUSED AND ON HELPING PEOPLE

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:11.476
PERIOD. AND I WILL BE

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.277
SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY TO

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:17.081
KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING-

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:18.282
BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IT

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:20.384
SOUNDS LIKE IT NEEDS. SOME

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:22.987
WORK- BUT I'M DOING IT I'M

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:24.455
THINKING OF THE MOTHER AND THE

00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:26.390
CHILD THAT SHE LOST BECAUSE NO

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.559
ONE DESERVES STIR TO LOSE THEIR

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:33.197
CHILD AND- WE NEED TO WORK ON

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:33.798
MAKING SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:37.468
HAPPEN EVER AGAIN. THANK YOU.

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:46.143
TURNS OUT. YOU IF YOU. NO THEY

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.213
GOT THERE I AM A WHILE YOU

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:49.881
UNDERSTAND. THE SPIRIT OF THIS

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:51.082
STATE I CERTAINLY DO I THINK

00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:52.550
ALL OF US ARE DEALING WITH THIS

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:53.951
ISSUE COMING FROM LOS ANGELES

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:55.720
COUNTY SING THE ISSUE EVERY DAY

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.555
TALKING ABOUT IT EVERY DAY AND

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:59.624
NOT SEE AND ALSO WITH GOOD

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.794
INTENTION- I. WOULD SAY I ALSO

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:04.729
BELIEVE THAT THE BILL HAS A LOT

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:08.099
MORE WORK- AND SO I DO AGREE

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:09.233
WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.736
THAT- WE HAVE AN AD AUDIT YOU

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:12.670
KNOW THAT STILL IS IN THE

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:15.573
WORKS- TO EVEN FIGURE OUT AND

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.341
THE DEFINITION OF THE LPS AND

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:18.409
HOW IT'S APPLIED IN THE

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.710
IMPLEMENTATION AND SO I THINK

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:21.646
THAT IN ITSELF. I WOULD BE

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:22.713
INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.082
WITH THAT DATA AND INFORMATION

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:25.716
LOOK LIKE FIRST BEFORE WE MOVED

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:29.153
TO HEAD. AND ALSO KNOWING THE

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.322
LA COUNTY HAS A HOUSING

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.323
CONSERVATORSHIP THROUGH SB

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.959
FORTY. THE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:36.494
KNOW ABOUT IT AT THIS POINT WE

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:38.262
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT EVEN MEANS

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:40.431
AND SO IN WHEN YOU TALK TO LA

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:41.465
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:48.172
THEY'RE DIVIDED. US SOME FOLKS.

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.974
DIFFERENT THING AND SO I THINK

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.242
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:53.277
BUT I LIKE TO KNOW THAT THIS

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.746
CAN STILL REMAIN AND EVOLVING

00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:58.249
BILLS AT THIS TIME I WON'T

00:36:58.316 --> 00:36:58.849
SUPPORT THIS BUT I JUST WANTED

00:36:58.916 --> 00:36:59.450
TO. ENSURE YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:06.290
THANK YOU. THAT'S MITCHELL

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.858
THANK YOU SINCE MY COLLEAGUE

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:10.394
REFERENCE ME AND HER- MONEY I

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:11.295
WANTED TO PROVIDE A CLEAR FOR

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:13.698
CATION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SUB

00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:15.266
ONE WE WERE A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.801
AGO TALKING ABOUT THE CLOSURE

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:19.403
OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.173
THE CHALLENGE WITH THE FROM

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:23.274
SOMEONE FROM PEOPLE'S

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.943
PERSPECTIVE THE DELAY IN HAVING

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.479
A SCHEDULE. WAS TO MAKE SURE

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.381
THAT EVERYONE WHO WAS BEING

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:32.416
REMOVED FROM THE CENTERS WAS

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.619
PLACED IN A HOME AND SO WHILE

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:35.720
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:38.022
REASONS WHY WE HAVE HAD THIS

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:40.324
REALLY KIND OF SLOW BURN THIS

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.026
UPTICK IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.461
OF HOMELESS IT'S NOT A RESULT

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.762
OF THE CLOSURE OF THOSE TO BE

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:46.197
SOME DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THE

00:37:46.263 --> 00:37:48.332
REASON THEY TOOK SO LONG FOR

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:49.900
THE CLOSURE WAS TO FIND AN

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:52.570
APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY SADDAM

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:54.438
PLACEMENT SO I JUST WANTED TO

00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:56.073
PROVIDE THAT CLARIFICATION THAT

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.575
MAY HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE WORK

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:06.617
CONFLATE THOSE TWO ISSUES DO WE

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:07.918
HAVE PEOPLE IN THE STREET WHO

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:10.388
SHOULDN'T BE WITHOUT QUESTION-

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:13.958
DID WE- AS A STATE AS THE

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:15.660
LEGISLATURE OF ADMINISTRATION

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.695
NOTDO WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:19.296
WHEN THE STATE MENTAL HEALTH

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:20.331
HOSPITALS WERE CLOSE FORTY

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:23.601
YEARS AGO ABSOLUTELY MUST WE DO

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:26.103
MORE IN TERMS OF BOARDING CARE

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.371
FACILITIES AND OTHER SUPPORT OF

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:30.441
NETWORKS ABSOLUTELY BUT EVERY

00:38:30.508 --> 00:38:33.444
INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS THIS

LICENSE. FOR THE CLOSURE OF

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:36.647
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. WORK A

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.666
AT ASKS THAT WE GET SOME TIME

00:38:55.733 --> 00:38:56.967
TO WORK ON IT I KNOW WE HAVE

00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:59.070
OUR- THE PUNDITS HERE AND I

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:01.672
THINK THEY DO RAISE SOME.

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:03.074
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN TERMS OF

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.677
THE BILL BY OCT I DON'T THINK

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:07.178
WE'RE DISAGREEING ON THE

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:09.547
PROBLEM I DON'T THINK WE'RE

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:13.384
DISAGREEING ABOUT- SAYING THAT

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:15.519
SAMPLE PEOPLE IN WE NEED PEOPLE

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:19.657
TO GET HELP. AND BE SAFE PLACES.

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.492
I GUESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THE

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:24.762
BILL IS THAT IS THAT. BEFORE US

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:27.732
TODAY AND NOW WE ARE THE POLICY

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:29.800
COMMITTEE IS I WAS HOPING TO IS

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.402
GONNA BE A LOT MORE PROGRESS IN

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:33.771
TERMS OF RESOLVING SOME OF THE

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.606
ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED WHEN

00:39:35.673 --> 00:39:37.274
THE BILL WAS FIRST PRESENTED.

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:38.943
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:39.977
AND THEN ALSO SOME OF THE

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:42.413
OPPOSITON HERE IS THAT. AND I

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.481
KNOW THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:45.082
AND WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:46.450
THAT'S REALLY GOOD I KNOW YOU

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:47.585
WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU'VE

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:49.386
BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY OTHER%

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:51.889
VERY IMPORTANT- PAST EFFORTS.

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:54.759
IS THAT- YOU KNOW SINCE WE

00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:56.360
FIRST HEARD THE BILL LAST YEAR

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:59.930
TO NOW- KNOWING THAT THEY'RE

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:00.698
STILL GONNA BE SOME TIME FOR

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:01.665
THE REST OF THE YEAR TO TRY TO

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:03.801
WORK OUT. I MEAN WHERE ARE WE

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:05.302
IN TRYING TO RESOLVE SOME OF

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:07.438
THESE ISSUES WE HEARING ABOUT

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:09.740
INCONSISTENCIES AND DEFINITION

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:12.843
AS BLACK OF CLARITY- RESOURCES

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.211
IS A LITTLE BIT OF BUDGET THING

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:15.946
SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT WELL

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:17.715
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TIES SPECIFIC

00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:19.350
OF ENOUGH MONEY INTO THE BILL

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:20.417
ITSELF THAT THAT IS SOMETHING

00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:21.819
WE CAN WORK OUT THEIR NEST BY

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:22.620
THE WAY THAT'S APPROPRIATIONS

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:23.554
THAT'S NOT US WERE POLICY

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:26.157
COMMITTEE. BUT I DO FEEL THAT

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:29.593
IN TERMS OF THE ACT ITSELF THE

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.296
LACK OF CLOTHES ARE DIFFERENT

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:32.930
PETITIONS DEFINITION

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:35.633
INCONSISTENCY I REALIZE THAT

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:37.067
YOU AND I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:38.836
TENSION HERE THAT YOU KNOW

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:39.737
YOU'RE SO LIKE SAYING WELL

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:41.505
BECAUSE SOME COUNTIES ME

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:43.307
LASTING INTERESTED OR NOT THAT

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:44.208
NOW WE HAVE THIS FIELD COUNTY

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.643
CHOICE AND THAT WAS SORT OF.

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:46.944
YOUR WAY TO TRY COMEDY SOME OF

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:49.880
THE ISSUES- OBVIOUSLY NOT THE

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:50.848
SOLUTION I THINK SOME OPPONENTS

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:52.616
LIKE BECAUSE IT CREATES

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.885
DISPARITIES BUT I GUESS. WHERE

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.053
ARE WE IN TERMS OF

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.456
CONVERSATIONS TO TRY TO RESOLVE

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:01.525
THE DIFFERENCES SINCE THE LAST

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:03.160
TIME WE TALKED BECAUSE IN MANY

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:05.830
WAYS I DON'T SEE A LOT OF

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.198
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:09.133
VERSION WE LAST HEARD AND I'M

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.367
JUST CONCERNED THAT. WERE THE

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.102
POLICY COMMITTEE WE PASS OUT BY

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.537
SAYING WILL PLEASE CONTINUE

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:16.006
WORKING ON IT BUT IF WE DID

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:16.574
THIS FOR THE TIME WE STILL

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.210
HAVEN'T MADE THAT MUCH PROGRESS

00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:20.277
IN TRYING TO RESOLVE THE

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:24.782
DIFFERENCES. I AM CONCERNED

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:28.285
THAT BURDEN. YEAH WE HAD A LOT

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:28.953
OF TIME TO WORK ON IT THAT WERE

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:29.486
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:30.788
GETTING THERE LATER AND I DO

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:31.555
FEEL RESPONSIBLE IS THE CHAIR

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:32.223
OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE BE SURE

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.791
THAT THE LEAST. WE CAN SEE AN

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:35.659
END IN SIGHT WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:37.027
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARY ALL COME

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:38.362
TOGETHER IN A BILL AND THAT'S

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:39.830
NOT THE STANDARD A HOLD. TO

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:41.432
THIS BILL EITHER THAT WE HAVE

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:43.000
TO GUARANTEE THAT WE HAVE A

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:44.335
SOLUTION- WE HAVE IN FRONT OF

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.470
US. BUT YOU KNOW WE ALSO DON'T

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:47.504
WANT IT OPEN ENDED THAT'S WHY

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:48.372

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:54.612
POLICY FORD SO. PERHAPS YOU CAN

ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE IS WHERE DO

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.755
WE THINK WE'RE GONNA EVENTUALLY

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.624
LAND THIS THING ARE WERE. OUR

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.024
WE ARE DO WE HAVE

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:09.727
IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES.

00:42:09.793 --> 00:42:10.661
CELLS ARE MARK THANK YOU MISTER

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:13.697
CHAIR- THE TWO FOCUSES HAVE

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.199
BEEN THE LANGUAGE AND THE

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:17.067
FACILITIES. I'VE BEEN MORE

00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:19.336
FOCUSED ON THE FACILITIES. I

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:20.704
THINK THE ISSUE OF LANGUAGE IS

00:42:20.771 --> 00:42:22.640
A WEAK ARGUMENT. AND SO I

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:24.508
HAVEN'T FOCUSED ON THAT WE HAVE

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:25.276
FIFTY DIFFERENT STATES WE'VE

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.544
BEEN ANALYZED. THEIR DEFINITION

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:29.947
OF GRAVELY DISABLED- I

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:31.815
APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T BRING YOU.

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:33.517
THE SPREADSHEET BUT WE HAD

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:34.985
SOMEONE FROM THE STATE LIBRARY

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.854
DO A RATHER THOROUGH REVIEW OF.

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:39.290
WHAT IS- GRAVELY DISABLED AND

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.424
THEN HOW IS IT WORKING IN THAT

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:43.527
STATE AND THE BROADER THE

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:44.028
DEFINITION THE LOWER THE

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:48.065
HOMELESSNESS. SO I DIDN'T HAVE

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:50.000
A PROBLEM WITH ARGUING ABOUT.

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.969
THE DEFINITION OR ARE ARGUING

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.671
ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS ASPECT

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:54.805
BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:56.907
CIVIL RIGHTS. OF ALL

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:58.842

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:01.845
WITH A TERM YOU KNOW LEARNING

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.147
NEW WORDS HERE IN THE SENATE

00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:06.016
BUT TO- IN YOU RIGHT CORRECT ME

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:08.085
BY THE END OF SIDE NAUSEA. I

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:09.420
MEAN SOME PEOPLE DON'T

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:10.888
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:11.855
MENTAL ILLNESS THEY THINK

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:15.092
THEY'RE FINE. AND THAT ISN'T

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:19.496
THE CASE. AND SO I'D. I'M

00:43:19.563 --> 00:43:22.199
CONCERNED ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE.

CLARIFICATION- WE'RE CLOSING A

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.279
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WHICH IS

TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SUPPORT OF

THAT'S TRYING TO DO SOMETHING

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:26.857
BUT IF WE DON'T GIVE.

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:30.327
PROFESSIONALS THE RIGHT. TOOLS

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:31.595
AND WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:32.763
SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY BUILDING

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.565
THINGS IF YOU CAN'T. HOLD

SOMEONE IT ACTUALLY TREAT THEM

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:40.037
UNTIL THEY NORMALIZE BECAUSE

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:40.637
THEN THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT US

00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:41.205
AND SAY WHY DID YOU TAKE SO

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:43.440
LONG. WHY DID YOU TAKE SO LONG

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:45.442
TO TAKE ME UP THE STREETS. OUT

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.244
ORANGE COUNTY I'VE BEEN AMAZED

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:50.414
ABOUT HOW PREVALENT. MENTAL

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.649
ILLNESS IS I HAVE SOME

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:54.618
WONDERFUL CONSTITUENTS BRIGHT

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:57.721
SMART PEOPLE AND THEY'LL HAVE A

00:45:57.788 --> 00:46:00.124
CHILD THAT HAS BIPOLAR OR

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.960
DEPRESSION OR SCHIZOPHRENIA. I

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:04.795
HAD A GOOD DOCTOR FRIEND OF

00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:07.331
MINE. YEARS AGO SAID TO ME I

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:10.167
SAW MY DAUGHTER FOR THE FIRST

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:10.701
TIME IN TWO YEARS SHE WAS

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:16.507
WALKING ON TUSTIN BOULEVARD.

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:20.577
I'M EXCUSE ME- SHE'S SHE'S

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:22.112
SHE'S SHE'S BETTER NOW YOU KNOW

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.747
BUT SHE'S BUT IT BUT IT WHICH

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:25.716
IS ON A ON A MEDICATION PROGRAM

00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:27.084
AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY ON THE

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.987
PROGRAM- AND IF THAT'S WHAT

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:30.754
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GET

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:32.890
THESE PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS.

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.424
AND TOOK THAT'S BEEN THE FOCUS

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:36.560
MISTER CHAIR IS THAT WE'VE GOT

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.995
TO. MOVE FORWARD ON BOTH

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.597
INITIATIVES. THE ABILITY TO

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:43.400
PROVIDE FACILITIES THE ABILITY

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:46.170
TO HAVE SOME INVOLUNTARY HOLDS

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:48.238
TO HELP NORMALIZE THESE PEOPLE

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:50.841
AND SO THAT'S WHY I FOCUSED ON

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:53.510
THAT. BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:54.778
ABOUT ALL THIS RIGHT TO MEANT

00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:55.946
WHEN A CONSTITUENTS AS I DON'T

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:58.015
pBECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE

00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.216
PARKING LOT OR SCARED ME

00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:00.918
EITHER. TAKING MY CAR HANDLES

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.953
ARE DOING THANK. YOU NOTE. WE

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.022
GOT CIVIL RIGHTS FOR EVERYBODY

00:47:05.088 --> 00:47:06.356
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT'S

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:08.725
WHY I MADE THE FOLKS AND I

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:09.359
APOLOGIZE FOR THE WRONG ANSWER.

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:11.795
LONG LONG ANSWERS GET. A CELL

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:13.964
BUT PERHAPS- I CAN PASS. THE

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.165
OPPONENTS CAN ALSO SPEAK TO

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:18.001
WEAR DAY. IT IS. THANK THANK

00:47:18.068 --> 00:47:20.871
YOU SIR YES- WINNERS THAT. UP I

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:23.273
WOULD WANT TO POINT OUT THAT.

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.908
THIS OF COURSE WAS IS NOT THE

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:25.876
FIRST BILL THAT WE'VE DEALT

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:28.178
WITH IN THE LAST FEW YEARS- ON

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:29.880
THIS VERY ISSUE AND AS YOU KNOW

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:32.082
SENATOR WIENER. HAD HIS

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:34.685
LEGISLATION THAT- ESSENTIALLY

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:37.254
CREATED WITH THE AND- THREE

00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:38.555
COUNTIES ONE OF WHICH IS LOS

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:41.158
ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO WHO

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:42.759
IS THE ONLY COUNTY. WHICH IS

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:43.860
THE ONLY COUNTY NOW THAT'S

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:46.430
IMPLEMENTING THAT INTO THAT WAS

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:49.266
I THINK. A PRETTY HARD IGHT.

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.736
CRAFTED APPROACH TO TEST WHAT

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:54.805
WAY BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO A

00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:56.807
DEFINITION. FOR GRAVELY

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.408
DISABLED IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:01.078
THAT. THAT HAS SET UP A PRETTY

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:05.782
STRICTLY- CONFINED- TEST WITH

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:08.418
SO. SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION.

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.854
CRITERIA THAT TO AFTER THE

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:12.556
PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS THAT WE

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:14.124
WILL GIVE US. A LOT BETTER

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:17.227
UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT IT IS TO

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:19.029
JUST YOU KNOW FIDDLE WITH THE

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:21.665
DEFINITION. WHAT WHAT ARE. LIEU

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:24.234
MAJOR CONCERN- THAT WE FOCUS

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:25.902
ON. IS AGAIN AS I MENTIONED

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:32.476
EARLIER THE LPS. IS YOUR A- A

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:36.780
WHOLE ARRAY OF. PROCESSES THAT

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:39.349
IS USED TO DETERMINE- WHETHER

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.351
AN INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE HELD

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:43.120
DUE TO A RISK TO THEMSELVES OR

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:46.023
OR OTHERS AND INCLUDED IN THAT

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:47.624
IS REALLY CRAFTING THE RIGHTS

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:50.260
THAT GO ALONG- WITH THAT IT'S

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:52.629
SORT OF PICK OFF ONE PIECE- OF

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:55.198
LPS- WHICH WOULD BE THIS

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:57.768
DEFINITION. SKEWS THE ENTIRE

00:48:57.834 --> 00:49:02.139
APPROACH WE WOULD SUGGEST- TO-

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:05.509
HOW HOW WE- MAKE THE

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.544
DETERMINATIONS ON WHETHER THE

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:08.712
PERSON HAS A REST OF THEMSELVES

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:11.848
OR OTHERS- CAM IN FINE JUST HAD

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:12.482
ONE OTHER POINT THAT I THINK IS

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:15.285
REALLY IMPORTANT AND I

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:17.788
APPRECIATE SENATOR. MITCHELL

00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:20.924
RAISING THIS IS THAT'S REALLY A

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:23.193
FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION THAT WE

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.463
AS A STATE MADE- BACK WHEN- THE

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.632
LAND SHERMAN ACT WAS CREATED%

00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:30.300
FOR THE PURPOSES OF PERSONS

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:31.668
WITHOUT DEVELOPMENTAL

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:33.337
DISABILITIES WE SHOWS IN

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:36.173
CALIFORNIA THAT THOSE WERE MORE

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:38.375
DESERVING. WAS A MORE DESERVING

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:40.444
POPULATION THAN THOSE

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.245
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEHAVIORAL

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:44.381
HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:46.483
FOR THE THAT POPULATION WE

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.185
CREATED AN ENTIRE STRUCTURE

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:50.253
WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.356
THAT ENSURES EVERY INDIVIDUAL

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:54.958
HAS A TREATMENT PLANT HAS

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:57.327
REGIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY. AND

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:59.863
THE AYE AYE IT IS- REMARKABLE

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.132
SUCCESS TO ALTERNATELY GET TO

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:03.633
THE POINT THE WE'VE CLOSED THE

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.335
REGIONAL CENTERS AND MOVED

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:07.003
INDIVIDUALS NOT INTO FACILITIES

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.473
BUT IN TO COMMUNITIES. WE NEVER

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:11.441
DID THAT WITH- WITH BEHAVIORAL

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:13.009
HEALTH AND THAT NEEDS TO BE AND

00:50:13.076 --> 00:50:13.877
I THINK PART OF THIS

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:16.546
DISCUSSION. AIR AS WE'RE

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.648
TALKING ABOUT NOW HOMELESSNESS

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:22.018
AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND I

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.019
DO HAVE AND THEN WE'LL GET T.

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:25.188
IF YOU DON'T MIND- SO I JUST

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:26.323
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT SO WHAT

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.191
I'M HEARING FROM YOU CENTER

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:31.228
MORE LIVE IS THAT. HE COULD I

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:31.795
THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS I

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.830
HAVE IS ABOUT THE DEFINITION.

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:36.500
AND I THINK YOU SEE AN ANALYSIS

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:39.002
OF THE INTERPRETATION AND AGAIN

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:40.670
DIFFERENT VARIATIONS AND SO

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:43.440
FORTH AND- IT'S AND I THINK I

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:45.709
HOPE BUT- YOU KNOW- I.

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:49.446
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THAT YOU

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:53.750
HAVE SOMEONE WHO MAY. BOTH IT'S

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:54.284
A CHALLENGING TO EVALUATE

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:54.851
SOMEONE TO TELL SOMEONE THAT

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:55.352
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU. NEED

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:59.823
TREATMENT. BUT YOU DON'T WANT

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.159
IT BUT I ACTUALLY NO BETTER

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:05.962
THAN YOU SO YOU SHOULD GET IT.

00:51:06.029 --> 00:51:08.799
RIGHT AND WE CERTAINLY YEAH WE

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:10.167
CAN ARE YET SAY THAT SOMEONE

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:11.201
WHO IS IN THE THROES OF MENTAL

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:12.369
HEALTH CRISIS MAY NOT

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:13.670
NECESSARILY BE IN THE BEST

00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:16.706
JUDGMENT TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:17.874
FOR THEM BUT I THINK THAT'S A

00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:19.242
VERY YOU KNOW AT THAT GIVE THE

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:20.177
VERY TRICKY ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:22.946
IT'S VERY TRICKY IF. TO DO THAT

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:27.017
RIGHT TO GO AND SAY SOMEONE. SO.

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.186
YOU SO ONE ISSUES FOR ME IS

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:31.688
THAT THIS DEFINITION NOW WHAT

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:32.689
I'M HEARING FROM DISPLAY RIGHTS

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:34.391
IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD A

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:35.992
PREVIOUS BILL THE WINNER ANY IS

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:37.294
THERE A PLACE OR IS THERE GOING

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.362
TO BE SOMEPLACE WE CAN COME TO

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:42.065
AN AGREEMENT ON A DEFINITION-

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:45.001
THAT THE- CARS THIS SOMEPLACE

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:46.102
WHERE IT'S LIKE OKAY NOW I WANT

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:47.571
REALLY BROAD ONE AND I'D BE ALL

SET TO LIKE WHAT KIND O TESTS

00:51:48.738 --> 00:51:49.873
ARE WE GOING TO USE TO BE SURE

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.441
THAT WERE APPLYING THIS

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:53.343
DEFINITION APPROPRIATELY AND

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.612
ALSO CONSISTENTLY- IS THAT

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:57.113
SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN GET TO

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.482
THEM IN THE IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS

00:51:58.548 --> 00:51:59.983
IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS THE

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.384
WELL WHAT WHAT WHERE WHERE IS

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:03.153
THAT GOD IN RELATION TO THIS

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.521
DEFINITION BETWEEN LET'S SEE

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:07.491
YOURSELF AND- I THINK DISPLAY

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:08.124
RIGHTS OF AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:10.427
RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. I

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:11.328
CAN KEEP WORKING ON THE

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:13.363
DEFINITION WHO WOULD LIKE ME TO

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.366
GO WELL I AM I WELL I THINK SO.

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:16.967
RIGHT I SAID AT THAT. MEETING

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:21.137
WITH THEM. SO I MEAN IS THAT IS

00:52:21.204 --> 00:52:22.539
I I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:24.708
LIKE IT'S- WHAT I ASSUME YOU'VE

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:26.843
TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THIS

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:27.377
BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN. THAT

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:30.247
DOCTOR TOM INSULT. IN A PRESS

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:32.315
GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S APPOINT

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:33.650
POINTY TO THE MIDDLE L. L. A.

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:36.386
U. APPY TO IT OKAY CAN DO

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:36.987
BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE IS I GOT

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:38.622
PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS. IT

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:41.291
WELL AND BUT THE THING IS WE

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:44.394
ALSO I MEAN WE NEED TO. I THINK

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:46.096
WE NEED TO TRY TO COME TO A

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:49.733
PLACE WHERE. WHERE BASICALLY

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.034
YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT

00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:53.169
YOU HAVE A DEFINITION THAT

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:54.371
CITIZENS CONSISTENTLY ARE

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:55.572
INAPPROPRIATELY THAT'S GONNA

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:57.173
CAUSE ITS OWN PROBLEMS TOO SO I

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.276
MEAN I GET SO WE WE'VE WITH

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:00.510
THAT SO I'M HOPING THAT I WAS

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:01.678
HOPING THAT ACTUALLY WHEN WE

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:02.779
FIRST HEARD THE BILL THAT WE

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.581
WOULDACTUALLY BE. MUCH FARTHER

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:06.883
ALONG IN FIGURING OUT LIKE A

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:12.289
AGREED UPON. APPROACH TO THE

00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:14.424
POT THIS POPULATION SO I DON'T

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:17.694
KNOW IT WOULD HELP THEIR BEEN-CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN DISPLAY

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.829
RIGHTS AND- OFFICE ABOUT THIS.

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.464

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.036
LITTLE SURPRISED TO SEE THE

00:53:26.102 --> 00:53:28.071
ACTUALLY THE AMENDMENT THAT

00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:29.673
ACTUALLY WENT THE WRONG

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:33.343
DIRECTION- FOR US BY GIVING THE

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.245

SENATOR ON THAT AND WHICH I.

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:42.552
TRY TO. ARTICULATE WAS THAT.

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:44.888
THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT GETS

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:46.723
RESOLVED WITH JUST A

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:49.059

MORE PEOPLE INTO A SYSTEM THAT

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:15.652
WE THINK IS ILL EQUIPPED TO

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:19.322
HANDLE THAT- IT IS NOT THE

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.324

UNDERNEATH THE LAW THAT ARE

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.415

SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS UNDER THE

AMOUNT OF CONSERVATORSHIP

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:07.831
BETTER UTILIZED IN- ACROSS THE

00:56:07.897 --> 00:56:10.633
STATE WE HAVE COUNTY IS THAT-

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.403

IT THEIR FSP PROGRAMS AND THEY

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:15.939
ACTUALLY DO SEE A REDUCTION IN

00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:16.773
THE UTILIZATION OF

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.742

COMPOUND. THINGS IT'S A VERY

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:29.018
COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT IS

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:30.854
OCCURRING AND THERE'S A LOT OF

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.388
COMPLEXITY THAT WE DON'T SEE A

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:34.491
SIMPLE DEFINITION CHANGE WOULD

00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:39.629
SOLVE THE ISSUES THAT WE SEE-

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:40.230
OUT OF SOCIETY LEVEL. SOME BUT

00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:43.099

SAYS EARLY BY. THANK YOU MISTER

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:51.274
CHAIR IT THIS IS JUST I THINK

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:52.041
SOMETHING THAT PLAGUES ALL OF

00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:55.178
US AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT NOT

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:57.280
ONE BILL IS GOING TO FIX AND I

00:56:57.347 --> 00:56:58.882
AGREE THAT IT'S A SOCIETAL

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:01.551
ISSUE- WHEN PEOPLE SAY I THINK

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:03.186
SENATOR MITCHELL WHEN YOU WENT

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:06.389
TO UTAH AND- AND DID THAT TO

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:08.291
SEE WHAT HOW THE HEAD OF THEIR

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:09.826
HOMELESSNESS. AND THEY HAVE A

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:11.928
3% HOMELESSNESS I THINK IT'S

00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:13.997
DIFFERENT BECAUSE I THINK WHAT

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:15.298
YOU BROUGHT BACK TO US IS THAT

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:17.834
PEOPLE IN UTAH LOOK AT SOMEONE

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:18.935
WHO'S ON THE STREET AS THEIR

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:20.970
BROTHER OR THEIR SISTER AND WE

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.305
DON'T DO THAT HERE IN

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:23.640
CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD SAY IN

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.475
MANY OTHER AREAS IN THIS

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:27.010
COUNTRY SO HOW DO WE CHANGE

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:28.578
PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE I KNOW

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:30.146
WHEN I LOOK AT SOMEONE ON THE

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:30.780
STREET I THINK BY THE GRACE OF

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:32.982
GOD IT'S NOT ME OR MY FAMILY-

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.884
AND MENTAL ILLNESS IS A HUGE

00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:36.085
ISSUE AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:37.253
FAILED MANY MANY YEARS AGO. AS

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.356
A STATE- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:42.492
YOU KEEP WORKING ON THIS BILL

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:44.060
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU THINK THAT

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.296
LANGUAGE IS A WEAK ARGUMENT BUT

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:48.231
I HAVE TO DISAGREE I THINK THAT

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:50.667
WORDS MATTER AND IF WE DON'T

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:52.502
GET THE WORDING RIGHT WE COULD

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:53.069
ACTUALLY BE IN A WORSE

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:56.472
SITUATION THAN WERE IN- I'LL

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:57.640
GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:59.075
WORRYING THAT DIDN'T GET US

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:00.577
WHERE WE WANTED TO BE. A NUMBER

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:02.278
OF YEARS AGO- RATE IT'S A IT

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:03.546
WAS THE LANGUAGE WAS THEY

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:06.082
SHOULD BE TESTED AND WE ENDED

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:07.550
UP BEING IN A SITUATION OR RAPE

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.886
KITS OF SET ON- SHELVES FOR

00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:11.020
YEARS AND THERE'S A HUGE

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:13.289
BACKLOG THERE'S A NEW LAW NOW

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:16.159
THAT SAYS RAPE KITS SHALL BE

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:18.461
TESTED SO THAT WILL ELIMINATE

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:22.131
ANY FUTURE CLUB BUT I THINK

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:25.201
WORDS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:27.437
SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU KEEP

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:29.339
WORKING THE BILL. I ALSO WOULD

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:33.343
LIKE TO SEE THIS THREE AND WHAT

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:36.446
THEY COME UP WITH BEFORE WE

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:37.046
START MAKING DECISIONS. AND WE

00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:38.514
DON'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS. YOUR

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:39.883
WORK ON IT I JUST KEEP. ON THE

00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:41.284
BILL DOES NOT GET OUT OF

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.218
COMMITTEE TODAY. YOU KEEP

00:58:42.285 --> 00:58:44.020
WORKING ON IT AND I ALSO HIGHLY

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:45.121
ENCOURAGE YOU TO TALK TO

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:46.856
OPPOSITION. BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:47.757
I HAVE BILLS AND THERE'S

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:49.025
OPPOSITION I ALWAYS MEET WITH

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:50.393
THEM BECAUSE SOMETIMES ACTION

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.662
GOOD IDEAS. SO I THINK YOU FOR

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:54.931
BEING SO CONCERNED THOUGH AND I

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:55.565

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:10.013
LONG TIME I WAS HOPEFUL THAT BY

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:12.348
THE TIME WE GOT HERE TODAY THAT

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:15.652
THERE HAVE BEEN MORE PROGRESS.

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:18.187
HI I AM CONCERNED FOR EXAMPLE

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:19.989
THAT THAT THE DEFINITION ISSUE

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:21.891
I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST WORDS THIS

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:24.060
IS. A PROPOSED LAW IT'S A BILL

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.962
WAS GONE IT WOULD BE LAWS IT

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:29.699
PASSES THROUGH AND- AND- A PRE

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:31.334
SHEET THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:32.735
DRESS AND UNDRESS AN ISSUE THAT

00:59:32.802 --> 00:59:33.970
WEALL NEED TO ADDRESS SO HOW

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:35.405
DO WE SURE WE HELP PEOPLE WHO

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.573
NEED HELP. RIGHT WHO MAY BE ON

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.374
THE STREETS AND SO FORTH SO I

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:40.376
SHARE THAT WITH YOU AND I WANT

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:42.312
TO TRY TO COME OF THE SOLUTION.

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:45.982
MY CONCERN IS IT THIS TIME IS

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:48.651
THAT- IT THAT WILL YOU KNOW AT

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:50.720
THE END AND KNOW IT TOO. TO BE

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:51.754
FAIR TO CENTER MORE LACK I MEAN

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:55.558
I WANT TO SAY TO. THE OPPONENTS

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:59.529
IS THAT BECAUSE AFTER I DO ALSO

00:59:59.595 --> 01:00:02.065
CHAIR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE.

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:02.632
I THINK IT'S A BIT MUCH TO

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.233
EXPECT. CENTER MORE LIKE TO

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.735
WRITE A BILL TO ENCOMPASS ALL

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:08.571
THE THINGS THAT BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:09.138
ABOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OKAY.

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:12.508
RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THAT YOU

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:14.143
KNOW I IT'S NOW I THINK IT

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.044
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN SOME

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.713
WAY BUT IT. DOES NOT CAN BE THE

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.448
SOLUTION TO EVERY SINGLE PIECE

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.882
WE OFFER AND BILLS AND WE KNOW

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.617
THAT IS THERE A CELL THAT I

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:22.785
THINK A BIT IN A BIT OF A

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.754
BURDEN- OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.255
DOUBLE THE POLICY COMMITTEE SO

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:27.223
SOME OF THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.558
APPROPRIATIONS HOW MUCH WOULD

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:29.892
IT COST ETCETERA I MEAN DOESN'T

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.227
NEED TO TOUCH ON THAT AND I

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.362
THINK THAT IT'S A BIT MISSING

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:33.763
SO I APPRECIATE YOU SAID YOU

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.365
CAN LOOK AT THE SILLY SIDE BUT

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:37.533
ALSO. THIS THE SIDE ABOUT IT

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.368
WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.269
CATEGORY IN THE PEOPLE IN THAT

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:41.237
CATEGORY WOULD PEOPLE GO INTO

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.507
THAT CATEGORY- BASICALLY WE'RE

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.708
GONNA SAY GOVERNMENT HAS

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.310
CERTAIN POWERS OVER YOU.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.611
ADDITIONAL POWERS OVER YOU

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.614
RIGHT AND- I DEBTS OSTENSIBLY

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.049
FOR YOUR QUOTE YOUR OWN GOOD I

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.184
GUESS I GUESS THAT'S WHAT- THIS

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:58.221
IS A- DEBTS. NOW THAT'S THE

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.088
RATIONALE BE THE POLICY

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:02.058
RATIONALE OR THE REASON- AND-

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.292
AND THEN SECONDARILY IN YOU

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:04.927
POINTED OUT YOU KNOW BABY IT'S

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.095
ALSO FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.297
COMMUNITY AS WELL- THAT AGAIN I

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:09.232
WILL BE CAREFUL WE DON'T

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.666
STIGMATIZE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:11.934
HEALTH AS- NECESSARY BE MORE

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:13.536
DANGEROUS THAN OTHER PEOPLE.

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:15.571
BUT SIDES ONE BE CAREFUL ABOUT

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.473
THAT TOO BUT WE BUT BEFORE BUT

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.208
WE'RE GOING TO BE A CATEGORY

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:22.945
THAT NEEDS TO BE. WELL DEFINED

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.647
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEN IT GOES

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:26.049
THE COURTS COURTS A DIFFERENT

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:26.949
RULINGS DIFFERENT

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.217
ADMINISTRATORS OUR BUREAUCRATS

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:28.918
ARE MAKING DIFFERENT

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:30.420
DEFINITIONS DIFFERENT BOARD OF

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:32.789
SUPERVISORS. AND THEN WE'LL

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:33.689
HAVE THIS WHOLE HODGE PODGE

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:35.691
AND- WE SHOULD ACTUALLY LOOKED

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:36.592
AT ALL THE DIFFERENT STATES AND

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:37.727
LOOKED AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.395
DEFINITIONS AND DID THAT KIND

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.330
OF BACKGROUND WORK. BUT I HOPE

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:43.166
THAT ACTUALLY THAT THEN DOING

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:46.302
THAT- KNEW THAT. I THINK IT

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.904
SHOWS THE CHALLENGE OF SAYING

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.272
WELL WE NEED TO COME UP WITH

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:51.274
SOMETHING FOR CALIFORNIA THAT'S

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.209
MORE WELL DEFINED THAT. COURTS

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:55.078
AND MINISTRY EDITORS AND BOARDS

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.646
COUNTIES AND EVEN THE STATE

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:59.482
ITSELF. CAN BE MORE CAN CAN CAN

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.450
CAN BE SURE THAT WERE DOING THE

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:01.851
RIGHT THING AND THAT WERE. WERE

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.386
WERE DOING THIS CONSISTENTLY

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:05.288
BECAUSE- IT THE ANSWER ISN'T

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.023
GOING TO. MEAN VARIATIONS IN

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.658
REGIONS BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WELL

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:13.429
IF YOU. HAPPEN TO BE IN THIS

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:13.963
COUNTY YOUR TREE THIS WAY

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.564
THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.900
CAN. ON THE ELKS SOMETHING VERY

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:18.634
DIFFERENT OKAY. SO

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:19.268
UNFORTUNATELY I AM NOT ABLE TO

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:20.436
SUPPORT. THE BILL TODAY IN THIS

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.872

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:25.174
YOU KNOW I IT BUT I DO. HOPE

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.176
THAT WE CAN WORK CONTINUE TO

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:27.777
WORK I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:30.012
TO KEEP WORKING ON IT- AT ONE

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.914
TO HELP YOU- IF WE CAN FIND A

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.150
WAY TO ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE IN A

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.185
FUTURE PIECE OF LEGISLATION I

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.587
DO THINK IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:39.422
WHERE OF HOPING IT WOULD BE- I

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:40.990

THIS OF THE RACE AND ONE. WE

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.129
ALL DONE BILLS WE MAY NOT GET

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:47.330
THE OPPOSITION MAY NOT KNOW SO

WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS. THE

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:51.134
IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I THINK

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.201
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S- I

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:53.736
DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:55.004
ENOUGH PROGRESS MADE FOR ME TO

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:55.771
