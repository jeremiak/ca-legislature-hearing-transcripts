ORDER -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WEBER FEAR JONES SAWYER. LACKEY. MELENDEZ STONE. OKAY WE CAN START OF THE MEETING WE HAVE THREE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY -- AND IF WE'RE FOCUS IT SHOULDN'T TAKE IS FOR EVER. OF WHAT OUR FIRST ITEM IS FLEET REPLACEMENT AND WE'RE GOING TO CALL FOR A PERSON FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LA OFFICE. DEAL THE ISSUE OF FLEET REPLACEMENT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] THE OKAY [inaudible] I HAVE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND AND WILL BEGIN. SURE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ERIC SWANSON ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CDC OURS OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES. THE FIRST ITEM YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS A REQUEST FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND AND FOR POSITIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING TO ESTABLISH A SEVEN YEAR SCHEDULE FOR CRITICAL FLEET VEHICLES. AS PART OF THE PROPOSAL CDC ARE WOULD REDIRECT. EIGHT MILLION FROM OUR BASE D. A. I. BUDGET FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND WITH ME TODAY. IS DEVON FONG HE'S THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF BUSINESS SERVICES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- CITY START INCARCERATE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND OFFENDERS AND THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS AND CONSERVATION CAMPS. CITIES HERE AS A FLEET OF APPROXIMATELY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR OWNED ASSETS THESE AFTER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. FOR FIRE WASTE DISPOSAL RATIONS AND SECURITY. CDC ARE DOES NOT HAVE DEDICATED FUNDING FOR ASSET REPLACEMENT -- THE CDC ARE HAS UTILIZED DEPARTMENT OF ADULT INSTITUTION PROGRAM BUDGETS TO REPLACE ASSETS IN PRIOR YEARS -- THIS PROPOSAL HELP AND PROVIDE WHAT WOULD PROVIDE DEDICATED FUNDING TO HELP -- PROVIDE FOR FLEET ASSET REPLACEMENT. AB CA ARE ARE IS NOT ASSERTING -- SAVINGS WITH THIS OUR PROPOSAL -- AS AS SUGGESTED -- HOWEVER THAT LANGUAGES -- THE POSITION OF THE GS HOWEVER WE ARE WORKING ON A MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR MODUL IN OUR SYSTEM OF RECORD. TO HELP IDENTIFY SOME FUTURES -- EFFICIENCIES -- IN MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR -- BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE BACK -- WE DON'T HAVE ANY BASELINE DATA TO TO MEASURE AGAINST BASS I SAVINGS -- APPROXIMATELY FIFTY TWO HUNDRED OF CDC OURS ASSETS MEET THE DIGEST THRESHOLD FOR REPLACEMENT CURRENTLY. CDC ARE HOWEVER IS TAKING A MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH AND PROPOSES TO REPLACE ASSETS. OVER A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD -- SMOOTHING IN THE BACKLOG OF ASSET REPLACEMENTS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY STANDARD -- WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A MANAGEABLE IS -- CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'RE PLANNING TO REPLACE OUR LIGHT DUTY ASSETS BUT EVERY SEVEN YEARS WHAT WE PLAN TO PLACE. REPLACE THOSE ASSETS. SO WE UTILIZE A REPLACEMENT TOOL THAT -- MEASURES AGE MILES AND CONDITIONS -- CONDITION BEING A MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH THAN JUST AGE AND MILEAGE CURRENTLY BY THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES -- ABOUT 28% OF OUR ASSETS RIGHT NOW OR TWENTY YEARS OLD -- FOR AND HALF OUR AVERAGE -- US AT AGE IS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD. SO WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN PREVIOUS YEARS -- WE'VE WE SPEND ABOUT FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND DEPARTMENT OF FUNDS WHICH HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO KEEP UP WITH THE BACKLOG -- SO THESE ANTIQUATED ASSETS -- MEETING OR EXCEEDING THE DIGEST RECOMMENDED THRESHOLD FOR REPLACEMENT. IS PROPOSING A REST TO THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO PERFORM ITS MISSION CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. CORRECT. ME COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. RIGHT TO MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE I JUST WANTED. TO ADD THAT WHEREAS IN THE PAST THE DEPARTMENT IS REDIRECTED FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THIS PROPOSAL PROPOSING A SEPARATE FUND -- SUB PROGRAM TO TRACK SPECIFICALLY FOR TRACKING PURPOSES FOR FLEET EXPENDITURES. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PART LA L.. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LA OKAY WE THINK THAT MORE FREQUENT REPLACEMENT OF VEHICLES MAKES SENSE AS A PART OF A STRATEGY TO MINIMIZE OVERALL COSTS OF FLEET OWNERSHIP. AND BY THAT I'M AYE SENSUALLY MEANS SELLING VEHICLES NEAR THE POINT WHEN THEY'RE INCREASING REPAIR AND FUEL COSTS. START TO EXCEED THEIR ANNUAL DEPRECIATE THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH BEST PRACTICES IN THE FIELD OF FLEET MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE TO CONCERT -- A FEW CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL -- AND THOSE ARE THAT -- REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT ADMINISTRATION DOES OR DOESN'T AND IS IT EITHER ISN'T PURSUING THIS PROPOSAL WITH A GOAL OF ACHIEVING SAVINGS WE THINK THAT IT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN SAVING SO -- WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO SCORE SAVINGS IN VEHICLE VEHICLE FUEL MAINTENANCE. REPAIR AND HIGHER RESALE VALUE. HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THOSE SAVINGS THAT WE THINK WOULD BE LIKELY TO ACCRUE. WE ALSO NOT NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT -- GIVEN THE WAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS SCHEDULED OUT -- THE DEPARTMENT COULD STILL RE DIRECT MONEY TO OTHER PURPOSES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION. I'M DOING SO COULD INCREASE FLEET COSTS AS IT WOULD TAKE AWAY RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO REPLACE VEHICLES. AT IN A MANNER THAT -- MINIMIZING OVERALL COSTS. IT ALSO NOTE THAT WHILE DEPARTMENT. I JUST IDICATED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A BASE BUDGET. FOR A FLEET REPLACEMENT AND THEY DO HAVE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND OF THE RIP ADD. ASSET REPLACEMENT FUNDS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROPOSING. TO YOU TO PERMANENTLY DEDICATE VEHICLES SO ESSENTIALLY THEY DO HAVE AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR BASE BUDGET FOR VEHICLES -- THESE ARE THEY'VE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THEY'RE HAVING CHALLENGES IN -- MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTIONS WITH THEIR EXISTING FLEET THAT -- BUT THEY HAVEN'T PROVIDED ANY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT ARE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE INADEQUACY OF THEIR CURRENT FLEET. SO WE RECOMMEND -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CDC ART ESTIMATE SAVINGS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THIS PROPOSAL BY APRIL FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN WE FULLY REALIZE THAT IT -- AND MAYBE. THIS WILL HAVE TO BE IN STILL POSSIBLE TO PREDICT PRECISELY HOW MUCH SAVINGS WOULD RESULT -- WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REDUCE THE MINISTRY OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET BY THAT SAVINGS AMOUNT AND THEN APPROVING A SEPARATE APPROPRIATION THE THIRTY TWO MILLION FOR VEHICLE REPLACEMENT THANK YOU. SO YOUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE WOULD WE TAKE THE EIGHT MILLION OUT OF THAT BUDGET BUT THEN PUT IT BACK IN IN THE WITH THE THIRTY TWO MILLION OR SO THAT THIRTY TWO MILLION. SO THAT THE EIGHT MILLION IS ALREADY IN THE BUDGET RIGHT JUST BE DEDICATED SOLELY TO VEHICLES WHICH IS PART OF THE PROPOSAL RIGHT AND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AN ON GOING FUNDING FOR THE FUNDING WOULD BE BASICALLY THE SAME JUST ROOF STRUCTURE. CORRECT THANK YOU OKAY RIGHT. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. MEMBERS HERE. OKAY ANY COMMENTS SO -- FROM THE AUDIENCE ONE MINUTE. ANY OTHER ANY CLOSING REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS BRINGS US TO AYE ISSUE TO THEIR TWO PANELS AN ISSUE -- TOO THIS CAN DEALS WITH THE PRO PROCESS OVERVIEW AND SUPPLEMENTAL REFORMS TO PAROLE CONSIDERATION THE FIRST PANEL IS MADE FROM -- SOMEONE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION REHABILITATION FROM THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS AND OF COURSE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LA L.. OKAY. OUR SECOND PANEL WOULD BE FROM SOMEONE FROM THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS AND PROFESSOR HEIDI RAMOS OF FROM U. S. SEES. A SCHOOL OF LAW OKAY. AS WELL AS KEEP WHAT WIDELY ON COMMON LAW AND MICHAEL MENDOZA ANTI RECIDIVISM THAT'S THE SECOND PANEL SO WE'LL CALL THEM UP AFTER THE FIRST. ALL RIGHT YEAH SO THIS PANEL IS WE'RE GONNA DEAL WE'RE GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- TO BE PH PROCESS IN GENERAL I'M ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THE REQUEST WE MADE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WHICH IS FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWELVE POINT FIVE POSITIONS IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND MONEY ON GOING FOR TO ADJUST THE RATES -- AND FOR WORKLOAD RELATED TO PROJECTED AND THE BUDGET TO ADJUST THE RATES WE PROVIDE ATTORNEYS WHO REPRESENT INMATES AND PAROLE HERE ONLY HEARINGS AS WELL. OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT FOR THIS ISSUE AND THE NEXT TWO ISSUES IS JENNIFER SCHAEFFER SHE'S THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS. AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I AM A HAPPY TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRO HEARING PROCESS WITH YOU. I'VE BEEN AT THE BORDER PRO HEARINGS FOR I'M GOING ON EIGHT YEARS IN -- IN JUNE. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE PRO HEARING PROCESS IN GENERAL SO. HERE WE GO. ROLL HEARINGS ON THE INMATES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE SUITABILITY HEARING BEFORE THE BORDER PRO HEARINGS ONCE THEY'VE SERVED A MINIMUM TERM. SO FOR INSTANCE FOR A LIFE TERM IN MAY TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE -- THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE HEARING ONCE THEY'VE SERVED TWENTY FIVE YEARS LESS ANY CREDITS THEY MIGHT EARN. THAT'S WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR INITIAL HEARING FOR YOUTH PAROLE -- YOUTH OFFENDERS YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEARING AFTER THEY THERE ARE TWO TWENTY SIX YOUTH OFFENDERS UNDER AGE TWENTY SIX WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR COMMITMENT OFFENSE. THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR PRO SUITABILITY HEARING AFTER THEY'VE SIR FIFTEEN TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE SENTENCE IT'S BEEN IMPOSED BY THE COURTS. FOR ELDERLY PAROLE -- INMATES WHO ARE AGE SIXTY YEARS OF INCARCERATION ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEARING. AS WELL SO OUR PROCESS BEGINS -- DURING THE SIXTY YEAR PRIOR TO AN INMATE'S INITIAL HEARING. WE SIT DOWN A COMMISSIONER DEPUTY COMMISSIONER WILL SIT DOWN AND MEET WITH PAT -- INMATE ONE ON ONE FOR WHAT'S CALLED A CONSULTATION AND THEN THE CONSULTATION WHAT WE DO IS WE EXPLAIN THE PRO HEARING PROCESS WE TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMMING THAT THEY'VE DONE SO FAR. AND WE GIVE THEM RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO BECOME A MORE SUITABLE FOR PAROLE PRIOR TO THEIR HEARING. IN THE COMING UP WITH THAT TERM THAT THAT DURING THE SIXTY YEAR PRIOR TO THEIR INITIAL HEARING -- WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND TALKED TO MANY PRO LIFERS AS WELL AS INMATES AND ASK THEM WHAT WHEN DO YOU THINK WHEN DURING YOUR PERIOD OF INCARCERATION DO YOU THINK OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL. TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO A PRO COULD COMMISSIONER DEPUTY COMMISSIONER. AND MOST -- RESPONDED THAT ROUGHLY FIVE THEY WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS PREVIOUSLY THE LAW REQUIRED THEM AS TO MEET WITH THEM AFTER THEIR THIRD YEAR OF THEIR LIFE TERM WHICH COULD EVEN DECADES BEFORE THEIR INITIAL HEARING SO. THAT CHANGED. ALL RIGHT ONCE WE HAVE A CONSULTATION THE NEXT THING WE DO IS WE SCHEDULE THEIR HEARINGS WE SCHEDULE HEARINGS FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE. THE REASON IT'S SO FAR OUT IS BECAUSE SO MANY MANY THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN PRIOR TO HEARING. FIRST THING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS WE HAVE A COUNSELOR A CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR THAT NEEDS TO DO A POST CONVICTION REPORT FOR US. SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE MANY OF THESE ARE MADE TO ME DOWN FOR DECADES MANY MANY YEARS. BASS HELP SUMMARIZE THEIR INSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOR ALL THE PROGRAM IT THEY'VE TAKEN OVER THAT THOSE VERY LENGTHY TIME PERIODS. THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE HEARING WE APPOINT THEM COUNSEL ALL INMATES HAVE A RIGHT TO COUNSEL WE APPOINT THEM AN ATTORNEY WE HIRE AND PAY THOSE ATTORNEYS. TO REPRESENT THEM IF THEY IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PRIVATE COUNSEL SO THAT HAPPENED A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH OUR CLIENTS. AND REVIEW THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTS. AT NINETY DAYS WHERE WE ALSO SKEWS ME A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS WE ASSIGN OF FRIENDS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST OF THAT WORKS FOR THE BOARD TO GO OUT AND INTERVIEW THE INMATE. AND REVIEW THEIR CENTRAL FILE AND PUT BASED ON SEVERAL TOOLS RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS -- THAT THEY ADMINISTER. THEY THEN PUT TOGETHER WHAT'S CALLED KIND OF THEIREXPERT OPINION REPORT ITS COMPREHENSIVE RISK ANALYSIS RISK ASSESSMENT FOR US FOR USE BY THE BOARD IT'S ALSO PROVIDED TO THE INMATE IN MAKE COUNCIL AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. AT NINETY DAYS PRIOR TO HEARING UNDER THE LAW WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEND NOTICES TO VICTIMS OF CRIME IN THE REGISTER VICTIMS. AND TO THE LAW REQUIRES US TO ALSO SEND A NOTICE TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE HEARING BUT WE FOUND IT'S MUCH MORE EFFICIENT -- WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF PHONE CALLS IF WE ACTUALLY SEND THE NOTICES OUT TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AT NINETY DAYS AS WELL BECAUSE FREQUENTLY THE VICTIMS WILL CALL THE DA'S OFFICE WHEN THEY RECEIVE THEIR SERVICES. SO WE SEND OUT ALL THE NOTICES NINETY DAYS IN ADVANCE OF A HEARING. SIXTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE HEARING WE SEND OUT A HEARING PACKET COMPRISED OF WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE MOST RELEVANT DOCUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRO HEARING PROCESS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE BORDER PRO HEARINGS WENT COMPLETELY PAPERLESS SO WE TAKE ALL THE DOCUMENTS FROM THE CENTRAL FILE THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTS WE PUT THEM INTO A WHAT'S CALLED A A MASHUP -- WE UPLOAD THEM TO A SECURED FILE -- CLOUD BASED FILE SHARE TO THE INMATE COUNCIL AND TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THEY CAN THEN DOWNLOAD THEM ENCRYPTED AND CAN REVIEW THEM IN ADVANCE OF THE HEARING. AT THIRTY DAYS -- BUT WE HIRE ANY INTERPRETERS -- THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR THE HEARING. THEN AT THE HEARING ITSELF THE HEARINGS ARE CONDUCTED IN PERSON AT THE PRISON WHERE USUALLY AT THE PRISON WHERE THE INMATE IS HOUSED. AT THE HEARING. CAN BE -- BUT DEFINITELY WILL BE OUR PANEL pCOMMISSIONER -- SOMETIMES WE TWO COMMISSIONERS AND A DEPUTY COMMISSIONER ALL PRO HEARINGS REQUIRE AT LEAST. MISSION. AND THEN A SECOND PERSON EITHER COMMISSIONER DEPUTY COMMISSIONER. WE AT THE HEARING -- THERE WILL ALSO BE PRESENT THE INMATE WHO HAS A RIGHT TO BE PRESENT AT THE HEARING. SOMETIMES THEY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO BE AT THE HEARING BUT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE THERE SO IF THEIR HOUSE OUT OF STATE WE WILL BRING THEM BACK TO CALIFORNIA UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES. TO ATTEND THEIR HEARINGS. WE ALSO HAVE AT THE HEARING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM THE COUNTY OF COMMITMENT SOMETIMES THERE'S MORE THAN. ONE IF THEY HAD MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS FROM MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND ANY REGISTERED VICTIMS THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS AND A VICTIM REPRESENTATIVE. THE WAY A PAROLE HEARING USUALLY GOES TODAY IS WE START WITH THEIR SOCIAL HISTORY REVIEW THEIR UPBRINGING -- FAMILY DYNAMICS RELATIONSHIPS AND THEN WE GO INTO THEIR CRIMINAL HISTORY AND THEN WE GO INTO THEIR COMMITMENT OFFENSE AND THEN WE GO THROUGH THEIR INSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOR. AND PROGRAMMING SO VOCATIONAL AND REBUILT HEAD OF PROGRAMMING. ALL OF THAT IS DONE WITH A FOCUS. TO DETERMINE WHAT THE BORDERS VESTED -- BY LAW TO DO IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INMATE SITTING BEFORE US POSES A CURRENT UNREASONABLE RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THAT'S A LEGAL -- STANDARD THAT'S BEEN PUT OUT FROM OUR SUPREME COURT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN SOME WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONING THE INMATES OF THE INMATE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A CLOSING STATEMENT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL AND THE VICTIMS -- HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR AS LONG AS IT LIKE UNINTERRUPTED WITHOUT -- WITH THEIR OPINIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT -- TO THE INMATE SHOULD BE RELEASED. AND THE IMPACT OF THE CRIME ON THEM. THE OUTCOME OF HEARING IS EITHER GRANT OR DENIAL GENERALLY SPEAKING SOMETIMES THERE'S A CONTINUANCE IF WE GRANT PAROLE THERE'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY PERIOD WHERE WE REVIEW THAT DECISION. AND THEN THE GOVERNOR HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT DECISION FOR THIRTY DAYS. FOR A DENIAL UNDER THE LAW WE CAN DENY SOMEBODY PAROLE FOR THREE FIVE SEVEN TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS THAT'S UNDER MARCY'S LAW. I'M ALL HEARINGS ARE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED AND AS I SAID ALL INMATES HAVE A RIGHT TO COUNSEL. WE ALSO HAVE AN INVESTIGATIONS UNIT COMPRISED OF PRO AGENTS THEY CAN GO OUT AND CONDUCT. INVESTIGATIONS IS NECESSARY WHEN THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT COMES UP DURING HEARING. WHEN SOMEBODY IS DENIED PAROLE? FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY UNDER MARCY'S LAW AND UNDER A COUPLE OF Q. LAWSUITS. TO ADVANCE OUR NEXT PRO SUITABILITY HEARING DATE WE CALL THAT ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW WHERE WE DO IT ON OUR OWN WE LOOK AT EVERYBODY WHO IS. HAS BEEN DENIED PAROLE FOR THREE YEARS -- HAS A LOW OR MODERATE OVERALL RISK GRADING. AND WHO HAS NOT HAD A SERIOUS I SIGNIFICANT RULES VIOLATION SINCE HER LAST HEARING DATE WE REVIEW THEM ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER THEIR HEARING AND WE DETERMINE UNDER THE LAW WHETHER OR NOT. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE ADDITIONAL INCARCERATION REQUIRED BY MARCY'S LAW FOR THAT THREE YEAR DENIAL LINK THAT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC WERE VICTIMS. SO THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CASES THE RESULT A THREE YEAR DIAL AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CASES WHOSE HEARING DATES GET ADVANCED UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS. WHEN THEY'RE HEARING DATES GET ADVANCED THEY WILL HAVE THE NEXT HEARING EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER THEIR LAST HEARING? INSTEAD OF THREE YEARS. AN INMATE CAN ALSO PETITIONED THE BOARDS MADE A PIT WHAT WE CALL A PETITION TO ADVANCE THEIR NEXT PEARL SUITABILITY HEARING THEY CAN FILE THAT ANYTIME THEY CAN FOLLOW AT ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS AND THE IT'S THE SAME STANDARD. DOES THE ADDITIONAL KERR SERRATION REQUIRED BY MARCY'S LAW NECESSARY -- TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC THE ANSWER'S NO IF THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES A NEW INFORMATION SUCH THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY THEN WE WILL ADVANCE OUR NEXT HEARING DATE. CELL. THOSE OF THE HEARINGS THAT RESULT IN A GRANT OR DENIAL -- THE OTHER OUTCOMES OF HEARING CAN BE A WAIVER AN INMATE -- CAN VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR HEARING FOR ANY REASON FORTY FIVE DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THEIR HEARING AND THEY CAN WAVE I'M FOR ONE TO FIVE YEARS. THEY CAN DO THAT THREE YEARS AND SIX THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION AND THEN WE REQUIRE THEM TO GO TO HEARING. AND EITHER STIPULATE TO UNSUITABILITY WHICH IS ANOTHER OUTCOME AN INMATE CAN SAY I AGREE I'M NOT SUITABLE TO GO FORWARD AND STIPULATE TO BE UNSUITABLE FOR THREE FIVE SEVEN TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE POSTPONEMENTS IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF POSTS MOMENTS WHICH IS ROUTE RELEVANT TO ONE OF THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE TODAY. IF SINCE WE SCHEDULE OUR HEARINGS -- SO FAR IN ADVANCE. COMMISSIONERS IN PARTICULAR NEED TO REQUEST IN THE NECESSARY TIME OFF SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OTHERWISE WE SCHEDULED A PANEL FOR THEM TO SIT AND CONDUCT THEIR HEARINGS -- LAST YEAR WE HAD A VERY UNFORTUNATE OCCURRENCE OF THREE DIFFERENT COMMISSIONERS NEEDING TO BE OUT FOR A A MERCY MEDICAL -- ISSUES AND WE HAD TO GET FULL OF THOSE HEARINGS SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HEAR ABOUT TODAY IS THAT WE'RE ASKING TO EXPAND THE BOARD BUT OUR INTENT IS TO ONLY HAVE SIXTEEN PANELS. INSTEAD OF SEVENTEENS OF SEVENTEEN MEMBERS SIXTEEN PANELS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ONE COMMISSIONER THAT WE WILL KEEP IN ADVANCE. WHO CAN FILL IN IF THERE EVER ANY OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL ISSUES THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BRING DOWN SO MANY HEARINGS IT'S VERY COSTLY TO THE STATE? TO HAVE TO POSTPONE HEARINGS. OKAY -- LAST YEAR WE HAD ELEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX GRANTS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT IS 23% OF SCHEDULED HEARINGS RESULTED IN A GRANT THAT DOES NOT MEAN HOWEVER THAT THE REMAINING SEVENTY OF JUST MENTIONED HEARINGS CAN RESULT IN A POSTPONEMENT. THE COULD BE CANCELED THEY CAN BE WAIVED AND THE AMERICAN STIPULATE IF YOU LOOK AT JUST HEARINGS THE GO FORWARD THAT TO A DECISION OF GRANT OR DENY. THE GRANT RATE LAST YEAR WAS 39% SAID 39% OF THE HEARINGS THAT WENT FORWARD -- RESULTED IN A GRANT [inaudible] HI I'M. EXPLAIN THE WAIVER IN THE STIPULATION POSTPONEMENTS -- MANY TIMES INMATES WILL ALSO REQUESTED A POSTPONEMENT SO THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS -- STATE FAULTS MEANING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT THEY MAY REQUEST A POSTPONEMENT. TO RESOLVE SOME UNRESOLVED ISSUES SUCH AS MAYBE A PENDING RULES VIOLATION -- THEY MAY WANT -- TO MORE TIME TO DO PRO PLANS THEY MAY HAVE SOME ISSUE -- THAT THEY WANT. TO TAKE CARE OF OKAY TYPES THE PRO HEARINGS INTEL TWENTY FOURTEEN THE ONLY TYPE OF PRO HEARING THAT WE DEALT WITH WAS YOUR WILL CALL THE AT THE TIME -- WE HAD DETERMINEDLY SINCE INMATES AND WE GET INTO TERMINALLY SENDS INMATES SO -- PRIOR TO THE CHANGES A LOT FOR YOUTH OFFENDERS AND FOR ELDERLY PAROLE WE JUST DID HEARINGS FOR INMATES WHO WERE SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR LIFE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE MOST OFTEN TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE. OR LONGER. I'M SINCE ELDERLY PAROLE IN YOUTH OFFENDERS WE NOW DO HEARINGS FOR DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED INMATES AND THAT WAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOR THE BORDER PRO HEARINGS. NO THAT SOUNDS STRANGE BUT INMATES WHO WERE NOT EXPECTING TO HAVE A PRO HEARING WHO WERE GOING TO BE JUST RELEASE ON A DATE CERTAIN IN THE FUTURE OR NEVER BE RELEASED BECAUSE OF DETERMINATE SENTENCES FOR SO LONG -- THAT HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN A A CHALLENGE FOR US AND IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE I THINK FOR EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH I WERE SEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF INMATES WERE PROGRAMMING KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE A HEARING COMING UP WHO NEVER BEFORE -- ANTICIPATED HAVING A PRO HEARING HI I'M. ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ALL OF THE PRO HEARING ISSUES. ALL RIGHT I'LL KEEP MOVING ALONG OTHER THINGS THAT THE BOARD DOES JUST VERY QUICKLY WE ALSO HAVE A NON VIOLENT PRO REVIEW PROCESS -- THAT'S FOR DETERMINEDLY SENTENCE NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS IT'S UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN IT IS A PAPER REVIEW PROCESS IT IS NOT A PAROLE HEARING. IT'S ONE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE ALSO DO POLL DISCHARGE REVIEWS SO WE JUST CHARGE -- PAROLEES FROM PAROLE IF THEY COMMITTED THEIR CRIME -- PRIOR TO JULY OF TWENTY THIRTEEN UNDER REALIGNMENT THAT DUTY SHIFTED TO THE DIVISION OF ADULT PRO OPERATIONS FOR ANYBODY -- WHOSE COMMITMENT OFFENSE OCCURRED AFTER JULY OF TWENTY THIRTEEN WE ALSO DO SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR SCREENINGS AND MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDER HEARINGS AND WE DO COMPUTATIONS AND PARDON -- SCREENINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE GOVERNOR. SO WHY WERE HERE TODAY AND WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING THE BOARD IS FACED WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WORKLOAD FOR FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY THE MAIN DRIVERS OF JUST FOR CONTEXT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE CAN'T WE SCHEDULE FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX HEARINGS. ARE PROJECTIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY ARE THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO CONDUCT SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED HEARINGS. AND EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED HEARINGS THE FOLLOWING YEAR. EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR THIS -- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED -- THREE YOUR BILLS -- SB TWO SIXTY WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF THAT WAS YOUTH OFFENDERS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR FENCES. SB -- TWO SIXTY ONE INCREASE THAT AGE TO YOUTH OFFENDERS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX WHEN THEY COMMIT THEIR OFFENSE. AND I'M SORRY TWENTY THREE AND THEN AB THIRTEEN AWAIT INCREASED THAT AGE TO ANYONE WHO IS UNDER THE AGE. TWENTY SIX THOSE TWO BILLS THE LATTER TWO BILLS SB TWO SIXTY ONE AND A. B. THIRTEEN AWAIT HAVE A DEADLINE WHEREBY WE HAVE TO GIVE EVERY DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED YOUTH OFFENDER THEIR HEARING BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE PROJECT WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DETERMINEDLY CENTS YOUTH OFFENDERS. THAT WE NEED TO GET ON CALENDAR BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT WE COULD HAVE HANDLED. WE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST FINE I THINK ABSORBING THAT WORKLOAD HOWEVER WE HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER DRIVERS THE MORE HEARINGS THAT WE DO THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEWS WE DO SO THE MORE HEARING ADVANCEMENTS WE HAVE. SO WE'RE PROJECTING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED WHICH IS THE MOST EVER ADVANCED HEARING DATES WHICH ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO COME ON CALENDAR. IN A NINETEEN TWENTY THE OTHER MAIN DRIVER IS THE RESULT OF SOME CASE LAW AND UNDER PROPOSITION. FIFTY SEVEN AND THAT IS FOR THE NON VIOLENT INDEED COMMONLY WE NON VIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS THAT WERE SENTENCED UNDER OTHER. ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING SCHEMES THAT GAVE THEM LIFE TERMS FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENSES BUT THEY'RE RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE. SO FOR THE NON VIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS JUST BECAUSE IT'S EASY FOR EVERYONE HOW REFER TO THEM AS THEM -- AS THAT WE HAVE WE ARE PROJECTING ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND HEARINGS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT ON CALENDAR IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. UNDER THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN A LITIGATION. IT'S A CASE CALLED IN RAY ADWORDS BASICALLY WHAT THE COURT SAID WAS THERE'S DESPITE THE FACT THAT -- PROPOSITION. FIFTY SEVEN FROM SAID THAT -- THAT NON VIOLENT OFFENDERS WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE REVIEW AFTER THEY SERVE THE FULL TERM OF THEIR PRIMARY OFFENSE DESPITE THE REGARDLESS OF EXCUSE ME EXCLUDING ALTERNATIVE SENTENCES. I'M. THE COURTS BASICALLY SAID THAT DESPITE THE PUBLIC SAFETY -- pOPTED NOT TO GO FORWARD WITH INCLUDING -- NONVIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS IN THE PRO REVIEW PROCESS IN A PROP. FIFTY SEVEN DESPITE THAT -- THE COURTS BASICALLY SAID THAT THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES US TO PROVIDE PRO REVIEW FOR INDETERMINATE SENTENCE NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING I WANTED -- TO JUST UNDERSTAND BECAUSE LEGAL FIRST AS YOU KNOW I'M NOT BY THE THIRD STRIKERS ARE USUALLY SENTENCED TO A FLAT TERM TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE PER A THIRD STRIKE. SO WHEN THE COURT IMPOSES THAT TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE THAT IN AND OF ITSELF UNDER THE LAW IS AN ALTERNATIVE SENTENCE THE COURT DOESN'T ACTUALLY IMPOSE. A STATES AN UNDERLYING BURGLARY -- THAT MIGHT HAVE A RUNNING SENTENCE OF FOUR YEARS OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT THEY DON'T SAY FOUR YEARS IMPOSE THAT SENTENCE AND THEN IMPOSE TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE. THEY BASICALLY SAY YOU'VE BEEN CONVICTED YOU BE CONVEYED IT'S A THIRD STRIKE. WE'RE GONNA SENTENCE YOU TO AN ALTERNATIVE SENTENCE OF TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE SO WHEN THE WHEN THE CONSTITUTION UNDER PROP FIFTY SEVEN SAYS THAT -- WE ARE TO PROVIDE SOMEBODY A PRO HEARING A NONVIOLENT OFFENDER A PRO HEARING AFTER THEY SERVE THE FULL TERM OF THEIR PRIMARY OFFENSE REGARDLESS YOU DISREGARDING ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE SENTENCES. THERE WAS AN IMPOSED BY THE COURT -- THERE WAS NO SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE COURT OTHER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCE SO THE QUESTION BECAME NGUYEN WHICH WHEN WITH THESE PEOPLE WHEN WITH THESE INMATES BE ELIGIBLE FOR HEARING. WHAT THE COURT SAID IN IN RAY AT WORDS WAS THAT THE STATES WOULD HAVE TO GIVE SOMEBODY A PRO HEARING ONCE THEY'VE SERVED? THE WOULD HAVE FOR PURPOSES OF A THIRD STRIKE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE AND ASSUME THAT THE COURT THAT THE COURT IMPOSE THE AGGRAVATED TERM FOR THE UNDERLINE OFFENSE. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THE NON VIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS -- AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE SENTENCES [inaudible] SO. WE AT THE BOARD TO TRY VERY HARD WHENEVER THERE'S AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD TO TRYING STREAMLINED OUR PROCESS SEES MAKE THINGS MORE EFFICIENT BEFORE WE COME AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. SO YOU'RE NOT SEEN A COMMENSURATE REQUEST OF A 38% INCREASE AND IN BOARD MEMBERS OR IN STAFFING AT THE BOARD. INSTEAD WE ARE TRYING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS -- TO IMPLEMENT A NEW STRATEGIES TO ADDRESSES WORKLOAD ONE IS YES WE'RE ASKING TO EXPERIENCE FOUND THE BOARD BY TWO MEMBERS SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE FIFTEEN MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR SUBJECT SENATE CONFIRMATION. WE ARE ASKING FOR TWO MORE. THOSE ARE IN THE PENAL CODE SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THAT WOULD EXPAND THE BOARD -- UNDER THE PENAL CODE. THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING ONE WHICH WILL BE THE SUBJECT I'M SURE OF SOME DISCUSSION TODAY IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING WHAT'S CONSTRUCTION STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK. IT'S USED BY THE NATIONAL PRO ABORT OF CANADA THAT'S WHERE WAS DEVELOPED ADMITTEDLY IT WAS DEVELOPED MOSTLY FOR DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED INMATES BECAUSE AS YOU MAY KNOW MANY COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE LIFE TERM INMATES OR REALLY LENGTHY SENTENCES LIKE WE DO. SO IT'S BASED ON EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH THAT SHOWS -- SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES FACTORS EITHER AGGRAVATE OR MITIGATE AND INMATES RISK FOR RECIDIVISM UPON RELEASE. WE ARE USING THAT TOOL HARD LOOKING TO USE THAT TOOL AND HAVING A MODIFIED -- VERY QUICKLY ADMITTEDLY THE THIS GOT SPED UP WE WERE PLANNING ON DOING THIS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR STUDYING IT DOING ALL KINDS OF THINGS. AND THEN THE ADWORDS HIS DECISION HIT AND WE WERE FACED WITH WE NEED TO INCREASE -- OUR WORKLOAD CAPACITY SO WE CAN EITHER SCHEDULE MORE HEARINGS PER DAY AND TO DO BUSINESS AS USUAL ONLY FASTER OR WE COULD -- TRY TO DO IT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY -- WITH SOME STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING AND THAT'S FAR WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS A LADDER. SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE THE CARLETON UNIVERSITY OUT OF OTTAWA CANADA THAT CREATED THE TOOL IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED SEVEN OTHER STATES. AGAIN I WOULD JUST ONE EMPHASIZE OTHER STATES PAROLED -- PRO SYSTEMS ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT FROM CALIFORNIA MOST STATES DO NOT GIVE A LIBERTY INTEREST IN PAROLE LIKE CALIFORNIA DOES SO WE HAVE THE ADDED BONUS OF LOTS OF SCRUTINY FROM THE COURTS -- THAT THEY DON'T HAVE IN OTHER STATES IT'S ACTUALLY. I DON'T MEAN THAT SARCASTICALLY IT IS ACTUALLY AN ADDED BENEFIT IT'S VERY GOOD FOR US TO HAVE SOMEBODY SCRUTINIZING OUR DECISIONS. WE'VE -- BENEFITED GREATLY FROM THAT DON'T PROVIDE ATTORNEYS THEY DON'T HAVE WIFE HEARINGS -- IF THEY DO HAVE LIKE HEARINGS THEY COULD BE MAYBE TEN MINUTES FOR AN INTERVIEW -- BUT THEY'RE NOT ALSO DEALING WITH LIFE TERM INMATES WHO HAVE COMMITTED -- HEINOUS CRIMES SO IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A RATHER PROTRACTED HEARING PROCESS WE'RE LOOKING TO MODIFY THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK WITH THE HELP OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CORRECTIONS. THEY PROVIDED SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO US BROUGHT OUT SOME -- PRETTY AMAZING -- EXPERTS TO HELP US IN IDENTIFYING WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TOOL FOR US AND RECOGNIZING WHAT MODIFICATIONS MIGHT NEED NEED TO BE MADE. TO CONFORM THE TOOL. TO CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNING LAW. THE IDEA BEHIND THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK IS TWO FOLD ONE IT THREEFOLD SKEWS ME ONE IS -- TO IMPROVE CONSISTENCY AMONG BOARD MEMBERS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALWAYS ARE STRIVING FOR IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHETHER IN IN MAY TWO OR OR VICTIM COMES BEFORE ONE PANEL VERSES ANOTHER THE OUTCOME SHOULD BE RELATIVELY THE SAME. THE OTHER THING AND THE RATE THE WAY THE TOOL DOES THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS CONSIDERING THE SAME INFORMATION -- IN A IN A SIMILAR WHAT WOULD AGRA EIGHT SOMEBODY'S REYES THEY ARE FOR LEE ON THE FACTORS -- INCREASE FOR WE DO SO YES I MIND IF I JUST INTERRUPT YOUR NASCO PLEASE YEAH I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT JUST. HAS THERE NOT BEEN CONSISTENCY UP TO THIS POINT WITH RESPECT -- TO HOW THE SITUATION IS CONSIDERED AMONG PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS. SO I DON'T THINK THE OUTCOMES ARE THAT. THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT -- INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A COMMISSIONER SPENDS A MAJORITY THEIR TIME MIDDLE LEVEL FOR INSTITUTIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE DENIALS. THEN IF THEY'RE AT A HIGH PROGRAMMING INSTITUTION SO IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO FACTORY IN THOSE THINGS BUT I CAN TELL YOU -- WHEN WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS AT OUR MONTHLY EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETINGS WHERE WILL HAVE A CASE THAT COMES FORWARD SAY IT WAS A TIE VOTE OR THERE'S RECONSIDERATION OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT NEW INFORMATION? HEARING THE COMMISSIONERS TALK ABOUT HOW THE ADDRESS DIFFERENT THINGS IT DOES VERY I'M NOT SURE THAT IT IT RESULTS IN A DIFFERENT OUTCOME BUT I THINK IT DEFINITELY THEY THEY TAKE DIFFERENT INFORMATION AND KIND OF APPLIED DIFFERENTLY I THINK. SO IN YOUR SOLUTION TO REMEDY THAT SITUATION IS WHAT AGAIN SO THIS STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK WOULD HAVE IT IDENTIFIES SEVEN KEY DOMAINS THAT EACH COMMISSIONER WOULD FOCUS ON IN EVERY HEARING BOTH IN PREPARING FOR HEARING AND AT THE HEARING. AND IT BASICALLY. I'LL TELL YOU I THINK THE THE BIGGEST -- PLUS TO IT BESIDES ORGANIZING THINGS -- AND FOCUSING THEIR THEIR ATTENTION IS. PERHAPS NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT RESEARCH SUGGESTS HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT ON RISK. FOR INSTANCE SOCIAL HISTORY IF WE STAY TIME TALKING TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THEIR UPBRINGING AND WHAT IMPACT THAT MAY HAVE HAD ON THEM WHEN THIS IS THEIR TENTH HEARING. AND THEY'VE BEEN INCARCERATED FOR FORTY YEARS. IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS PROBATIVE AS YOU KNOW WHAT I'M JUST I AM FORGIVE ME I'M JUST I'M IS THERE IS THERE A A DOLLAR AMOUNT ATTACHED TO THIS REMEDY THAT YOU'VE SUGGESTED YOU'RE JUST NO COLLUDING THAT I'M INCLUDING IT AS THAT MOST PEOPLE ASK US -- IF WE'RE LOOKING 238% INCREASE IN WORKLOAD WHY ARE WE NOT ASKING -- FOR AND MORE COMMISSIONERS TO EXPAND OUR BUT IN A HE WOULD HAVE OR THAT RATHER THAN SENDING GOVERNMENT. YEAH. SO I APOLOGIZE THEM. IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD AS A REMEDY TO THAT WORKLOAD SO YES THERE'S NO MONEY ATTACHED TO IT. BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VERY NOVEL IN VERY DIFFERENT -- FOR THE PRO ABORTS SO YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SO MADAM CHAIR I IF YOU WANT TO FOCUS JUST ON THE FIFTH NO NO I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT I GUESS I'M -- SURPRISED THAT THAT TYPE OF TEST IF YOU WILL HAS NOT BEEN PUT INTO PLACE. IN THE PAST I DON'T UNDERSTAND -- WHY WE DON'T HAVE STRUCTURE DECISION WE GOT NOW SO WE DO HAVE OUTLINES FOR HEARINGS AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT BY LAW AND? THROUGH TRAINING WE DO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRAINING AT THE BOARD THAT EVERYONE COVERS. I WILL TELL YOU THAT UP UNTIL NOW -- THIS THIS WHOLE AREA THE LAW HAS EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE PRO HEARING PROCESS HAS JUST KIND OF GROWN -- SIGNIFICANTLY OUR HEARINGS ARE ROUGHLY THREE HOURS ON AVERAGE SINCE THE LONGEST I'VE SEEN IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WE KIND OF OUR MANTRA -- BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO SCRUTINIZED BY. OUR LEGAL STAFF THE GOVERNOR AND THE COURTS IS TO TALK OF A BETTER TERM LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED SO THE IDEA IS TO TRY IT RIGHT NOW OUR EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON CREATE THE MOST COMPLETE RECORD THAT YOU CAN IN THAT TRANSCRIPT TO COMPLETELY -- MAKE SURE YOU'VE COVERED EVERYTHING AND THAT YOU'VE LEFT NOTHING -- ON TOUCH AND IT'S JUST EVOLVE THAT WAY OVER TIME -- THROUGH RATES WITH THE COURTS AND THROUGH DECISION GOING TO BE A VERY GOOD WAY. TO RESTRUCTURE IT PROBABLY WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES. AND REALLY FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE THINGS THAT MATTER. I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH IT I MEAN IT DOES I'D I THINK THIS WARRANTS PROBABLY FURTHER CONVERSATION -- OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE HEARING ROOMS THEY DO HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS THAT ARE LINGERING ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CREATION OF WORK THAT ISN'T. NECESSARY BUT AS PART BECAUSE MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO TRIED LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION FURTHER AFTER THIS ON BUT THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUMP. SO. IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING THE BOARD AND DOING THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WHAT WE TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK. IT IS ON A FAST TRACK ADMITTEDLY. I A QUESTION THAT. WE HAVE KIND OF GONE. BEYOND NOW BUT I BACK WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE COUNSEL YES -- WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE PRIVATE COUNSEL IT'S GOT TO BE PRETTY LOW? I'M WHICH IS PROBABLY ABOUT IT WOULD BE. THAT'S ALL I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT AS I FIGURED IT WOULD FIVE BE PRETTY LOW. IT IF OKAY. I'M THE THIRD THING THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TO DO TO TRY AND ABSORB THE WORKLOAD WITHOUT ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IS TO COME UP WITH SOME -- COME UP SOME DRAFT REGULATIONS THAT WILL HELP STREAMLINE AND MORE IT NARROWLY DEFINED THE DOCUMENTS -- THAT ARE MOST RELEVANT TO PROCEED ABILITY HEARING CON -- HEARING. AND THE REASON BEING LIKE I SAID BEFORE RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF A SHOTGUN APPROACH. IT'S A FREE FOR ALL ANYTHING ANYBODY CAN DISCUSS ANYTHING AT A PRO HEARING AND IT'S ALL KIND OF DEEMED THE PANEL IS IN CHARGE OF DETERMINING WHAT'S RELEVANT WHAT'S RELIABLE. IN ADVANCE OF A PRO HEARING IF THE INMATE IN MAKE COUNCIL IS NOT PROVIDED WITH A DOCUMENT AT LEAST TEN MADE TEN DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE HEARING THE BOAR CAN'T USE IT DURING THE PRO HEARING UNLESS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A RECESS GO REVIEW IT AND COME. BACK -- OTHERWISE IS A POSTPONEMENT. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE -- WHEN SOMEBODY'S LIBERTY INTEREST IS AT STAKE AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY WE HAVE? A BOTH SIDES IN MAY COUNCIL AND THEY JUST VOLUMES I MEAN VOLUMES OF PAPER IN ADVANCE OF A PAROLE HEARING. AND IN PREPPING FOR PRO HEARING AS YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU HAVE THIRTEEN HEARINGS OR EVEN TEN HEARINGS A WEEK. YOU'RE DOING TWO TO THREE HOURS OF PREPARATION FOR EVERY HEARING TRYING TO REVIEW EVERY DOCUMENT THAT'S BEEN SENT AND PLUS THE ENTIRE CENTRAL FILE. IN PREPARATION FOR THIS HEARING PLUS PRIOR TRANSCRIPTS THE RISK ASSESSMENT THE VOLUME IS IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT STREAMLINING THAT SO THAT PEOPLE NEED TO DO. SOMETHING I CAN DO WOULD LIKE AN OFFER PROOF THIS IS WHY THIS IS RELEVANT TO THIS PROCEEDING. DON'T DON'T GIVE US INFORMATION FROM THE C. FILE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN FACT WE PROBABLY SET YOU. YOU KNOW DURING. ELECTRONICALLY -- TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE THE ORIGINAL CRIMINAL TRIAL. PROBABLY NOT RELEVANT IN EVERY CASE AND CERTAINLY NOT WHEN IT SUBMITTED FOR THE FOURTH TIME -- BECAUSE ASSIST THE INMATES FOURTH HEARING SO WE'D LIKE TO REALLY STREAMLINED THAT SO THAT IT CUTS DOWN ON SOME OF THE HEARING PREPARATION -- FOR COMMISSIONERS. OKAY HI I'M. THE FOURTH THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING IS IMPROVING ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION. AND THAT IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL WERE ASKING TO INCREASE THE FEE -- PER HEARING FROM FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS -- PER HEARING TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OUR PLAN HOWEVER IS NOT JUST INCREASE THE HEARING OF THE FEES -- WE ALSO WANT TO DO A SIGNIFICANT CREASING EXPECTATIONS -- FOR ATTORNEYS WHO ARE APPOINTED BY THE BOARD TO REPRESENT INMATES. REASON BEING I THINK ARE YOU HERE IN THE NEXT PANEL THE BULK OF THE WORK THAT IN A MAKE COUNCIL NEEDS TO DO IN ADVANCE OF A PAROLE HEARING IS TO ACTUALLY PREPARE THEIR HERE. PREPARE THEIR INMATE THEIR CLIENT PRIOR TO THE HEARING. THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO AT THE HEARING IS NOT PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT IN MOST CASES IT'S REALLY THE HEARING THE PREPARATION WORK IN ADVANCE. ALSO THE WAY OUR HEARING OUR FEE STRUCTURE FEES ARE STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW IT'S CREATED AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY GO TO HEARING EVEN OTHER INMATE MAKE THEIR CLIENT MAY NOT BE SUITABLE. BECAUSE THEY GET MORE MONEY IF THEY ACTUALLY GO TO HEARING. SO WE'D LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME TO GET THE INCREASE BUT ALSO WORK WITH IN MAY COUNSEL. AND PLAINTIFFS IN A PENDING LAWSUIT TO FIGURE OUT -- A BETTER WAY RECRUITING -- ATTORNEYS TRAINING THEM. PUTTING A FEE SCHEDULE TOGETHER THAT MAKES SENSE THE DOESN'T EITHER I INCENTIVIZE OR D. INCENTIVIZE A CERTAIN BEHAVIOR. AND THAT -- PROVIDES A MORE QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR IN MAY COUNCIL. SPECIFICALLY A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING FOR SO I WANNA SAY IT'S VERY AWKWARD FOR US TO BE IN THE BUSINESS OF APPOINTING COUNSEL WHO APPEAR BEFORE US. UNDER SUPERIOR COURT SETTING IF YOU EATING -- IT'S IT'S THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IF THEY NEED A CONFLICT OUT THEY GO THROUGH THE APPELLATE PROJECT A NONPROFIT THIRD ENTITY TO APPOINT TO RECRUIT AND APPOINT COUNSEL. ON SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT -- WE LOOKED INTO THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A LOT MORE COSTLY TO GO THROUGH A SET UP SIMILAR -- TO THE PALLET PROJECT OR EVEN TO GO THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE COURTS. SO WHAT WE ARE PLANNING ON DOING -- THIS IS JUST OUR RECOMMENDATION IT'S GONNA BE SUBJECT TO PROBABLY SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS -- IN A PENDING LAWSUIT RIGHT NOW WE'RE BEING SUED BECAUSE WHAT THE ALLEGATION IS THAT IS THERE ARE ATTORNEY FEE SCHEDULE IS SO LOW THAT EVEN QUITE STAND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL. SO THAT'S GOING FOR EVIDENTIARY PROCEEDINGS VERY SOON AND IT'S PROBABLY ONE THAT WE WILL NOT DO VERY WELL AT SO WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW TO REMEDY THIS. WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING OR WHAT WE'RE LOOKING ELEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WE WON'T CONFIDENTIAL SO WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT BUT I CAN TELL YOU? KIND OF OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW BEFORE IT STARTS PROBABLY IN A COUPLE WEEKS. I'M ONE IS WE WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE NUTS AND BOLTS TRAINING FROM THE BOARD SO THESE ARE LAWS THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IT A PROFITABILITY HEARING HERE THE BASIC EXPECTATIONS. WE'D LIKE TO CONTRACT WITH AN OUTSIDE ENTITY PREFERRED LEAH A LAW SCHOOL OR CLINIC THAT HAS A HISTORY OF TRAINING ATTORNEYS TO REPRESENT PEOPLE BEFORE THE PROBOARDS. AND TO HAVE THEM PROVIDE MORE OF THE ADVOCACY BASED TRAINING SO MORE OF THE YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW TO EFFECTIVELY -- IN A DEAL WITH LEGAL STRATEGY AND THINGS LIKE THAT HOW TO HOW TO REPRESENT YOUR CLIENT -- I DON'T THINK THE BOARD SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THAT AT ALL IT'S TO SUBJECT TO ITS SUBJECTS US TO A LOT OF ALLEGATIONS ABOUT BEING BIASED -- WE SHOULD NOT BE TRAINING PEOPLE HOW TO YOU KNOW BEST GET A GRANT IN FRONT OF US -- JUST NOT APPROPRIATE SELECT BECAUSE YES. YEAH JUST. ONE YOU INDICATED ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WAS THE LACK OF PREPARATION THE ATTORNEY ENGAGED IN WITH THE INMATE. I NEED TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT. SO FOR INSTANCE -- OFTENTIMES IN IN MAY -- DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE PRO HEARING PROCESS -- THEY THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM TO GO AROUND IN THE PRISONS THAT'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WHAT A PAROLE HEARING IS I HAVE A LOT OF TIME I'M KIND OF CONFUSED WHY THAT'S SO DIFFICULT. IT'S SOME IT'S A VERY YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND NOT ON THE SECOND PANEL AND YOU COULD PROBABLY HEAR BEST FROM THEM BUT IT. IT IS A PROTRACTED PROCESS IS A VERY LENGTHY PROCESS IT CAN BE VERY CONFUSING -- THERE A LOT OF RIGHTS THAT ARE INVOLVED THERE'S A LOT OF REVIEW OF THEIR CENTRAL FILE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY SIT DOWN WITH THE INMATE TALK ABOUT. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE INSIGHT INTO YOUR CRIME WHAT DOES IT MEAN -- TO TO REALLY FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE CRIME THAT YOU'VE HAD ON ON YOUR VICTIMS IN THE COMMUNITY -- WHAT TYPES OF PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU TAKEN TO ADDRESS THOSE FACTORS -- WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS A SYSTEM THAT? REWARDS INMATES ARE PARTICULARLY ARTICULATE. AND AND JUST KEEPS PEOPLE INCARCERATED WHO MAYBE AREN'T SO INTO ARTICULATE BUT WHO STILL DO NOT POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND FOR US SO IT'S THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ITEM YOU MIGHT WANT TO DISCUSS IN TERMS YES ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FIVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. OKAY. SO IT'S SIMPLY BILL TWENTY FORTY FIVE REQUIRES THE BOARD -- TO RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE COURTS CERTIFICATES OF ROUTE REHABILITATION -- WHICH ARE DIRECT FULL PARDON APPLICATIONS THIS IS THE I'M SORRY. AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE PARDON. OKAY LOOKING VERY IT'S A IT'S A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. WE DON'T HAVE THAT YET OKAY NEVER MIND THEN I'LL SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER HEARING. WE HAVE RECEIVED IT YET OKAY. RIGHT SORRY. IF ANYONE FINANCE SEVENTY COMMON. ADJUSTING IT AMEND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE JUST WANTED TO REFERENCE THIS SEVEN FIFTY AS PART OF THE ATTORNEY FEE REQUEST THE IT IS IT APPEARS -- IN LINE WITH THE COUNTY SURVEY THEY ATTORNEYS. AS FAR AS THEIR PAYMENT STRUCTURE AND WHAT THEY RECEIVE GENERAL OKAY. NO TRAVELS AS AFFILIATE NO TRAVEL FUNDS IS GOOD SEVEN FIFTY DOLLARS THAT DEAL CORRECT BUT I SHOULD EXPLAIN HOW WE APPOINT COUNSEL -- AS OLIVER HEARINGS ARE CONDUCTED AT THE PRISONS. WE BUILD OUR SCHEDULE ONE WEEK AT A TIME EACH PRISON. RIGHT SO WILL CLUSTER THE HEARINGS AND WE'LL HAVE ONE WEEK'S WORTH A HEARINGS THAT IRON WOOD. WE APPOINT COUNSEL FOR EVERY INMATE DURING THAT WEEKS WORTH OF HEARINGS. SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TRAVEL THEY CAN'T THERE'S SOME ECONOMIES OF SCALE BUILT INTO THAT THEY CAN GO OUT ONCE FOR SEVERAL -- CLIENTS MEET WITH THEM SO THEY ARE IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE TRAVELING FOR ONE HEARING IN ONE INMATE YOU'RE TRAVELING FOR SEVERAL HEARINGS AND SEVERAL INMATES. SO THERE ARE SOME ECONOMIES OF SCALE AGO WITHOUT. THANK YOU AT WE HAVE COMMENTS ON BOTH OF THE PROPOSAL SO IT SO YOU AND HOLD IT TO THE SO WE HAVE THE OTHER -- ONE SO ONE ON THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING OVER MARKET AND THE ATTORNEY PAY ALL RIGHT -- BOTH FOR THE FULL HEARING BOTH OKAY -- SO ON THE PROPOSAL TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASE IN PRO HEARINGS VIA THAT STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING TOOL AND IT INCLUDED TO SHOW RESOURCES. WE THINK THAT THE FRAME AT THE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK IDEA SEEMS PROMISING BUT WE NOTED THAT SOME KEY INFORMATION WAS LACKING FROM THE PROPOSAL. AND NOT INFORMATION THAT CAN PERMISSION IS TO AND WHAT WE FOUND LACKING WAS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROCESS -- AND TIMELINE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOOL HOW IT WILL BE USED AND HOW IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND EVALUATED. AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS AN INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE FUNDING REQUEST ASSUMES THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK. IN OTHER WORDS IT ASSUMES THAT THE FRAMEWORK WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON TIME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BUDGET YEAR AND HAVE THE INTENDED -- EFFICIENCY -- A FACTOR STREAMLINING EFFECT ON THE TIME THAT PRO HEARINGS TAKE -- IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT A FACT OR IF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS DELAYED IT'S POSSIBLE THE DEPARTMENT MAY NEED MORE RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR ANTICIPATED PRO NUMBER PRO HEARINGS. SO WE RECKON WE WITHHOLD RECOMMENDATION AND RECOMMEND DIRECTING SEE SHARED PROVIDE KEY INFORMATION BY APRIL FIRST AND A PROTOTYPE OF THE TOOL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW. AND THEN ON THE PROPOSAL TO RAISE COMPENSATION FOR ATTORNEYS APPOINTED BY THE BOARD. WE THINK THAT A NEW PATIENT ARCHER DOES APPEAR NEEDED BUT AGAIN WE FOUND THE PROPOSAL TO BE LACKING SOME KEY INFORMATION WHICH AGAIN AGAIN AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN YOUR AGENDA. BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL WOULDN'T FEEL LIKE AS AS IF THERE WAS A CLEAR BASIS FOR THE SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR -- PAYMENT OR INK -- THE REYES FROM A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CASE -- OR CLEAR BASIS FOR OUR OR CLEAR INFORMATION THAT I SHOULD SAY ABOUT THAT WHAT THE NEW STRUCTURE OF THE PAY SCHEDULE WOULD BE OR THE CHANGES TO RECRUITMENT TRAINING AND EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE ATTORNEYS -- SO WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE THE KEY INFORMATION BY APRIL FIRST -- AND IF IT IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL AND HAVING THE DEPARTMENT COME BACK NEXT YEAR [inaudible] OKAY -- ONE SEVENTY QUESTIONS THE SYSTEM. JUST A COMMENT ON THAT THE STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING TO IT I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE. SOMETHING THAT THAT IS VERY APPROPRIATE. AND MY PROVIDE SOME OF THE VA SOME BUT I THINK THAT. THAT WE NEED THOSE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS AND HOW IT GETS IMPLEMENTED THAT HOW QUICKLY GETS IMPLEMENTED. IT SOUNDS LIKE EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T PUT TOGETHER THAT PROPOSAL GETTING ALL OF THE COMMISSIONERS TRAINS. AND CHANGING HOW THEY'VE BEEN MAKING DECISIONS MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE GET SOME SOME INTERACTION WITH THAT. AND RATHER THAN I UNDERSTAND THE NOTION OF WAITING UNTIL NEXT YEAR BUT I DON'T KNOW THE DATE WE HAVE THE TIME TO WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR. BUT RATHER THAN PUTTING SOMETHING FORWARD THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND IN THERE SOME DANGERS TO SOMETHING THAT'S VERY FORMULAIC WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SO TALKING ABOUT YEAH BUT IF YOU BECOMES FORMULAE CAN BECOMES KIND OF COOKIE CUTTER AND THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE THE DIFFERENCES OF THE INDIVIDUALS THERE AND I KNOW RIGHT THAT'S NOT CHOI HOUSES I BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION. OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. HOW IT WORKS HOW WOULD BE DEALING WITH THE VARIETIES OF SITUATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT? THAT WE WOULD BE DEALING WITH BUT I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THIS BUT I THINK THAT WE DO NEED THAT INFORMATION. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND THEN. BUILD INTO IT SOME FEEDBACK THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS A SENSE OF ORGAN INVEST IN THIS. HAS A SENSE OF HOW IT'S GOING WHAT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ARE WHAT IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS LIKE HEY THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. SO WE DO HAVE MONTHLY BOARD EXECUTIVE A PUBLIC SESSIONS AND EVERY MONTH FROM HERE ON OUT -- WE WILL BE PROVIDING UPDATES AS TO HOW THIS IS DEVELOPING. I WILL CAUTION FOLKS. ADMITTEDLY WE ARE FAST TRACKING THIS -- BECAUSE WE DID NOT WANT TO EXPAND THE BOARD SO. IT'S GOING A NEEDS TO GO UNDER GO I'M NOT SURE APRIL FIRST WILL HAPPEN. BUT I'M DEFINITELY APRIL -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE SCHEDULED -- TO NOT CONDUCT HEARING STATEWIDE APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH AND TWENTY NINTH OR TWENTY NINTH AND THIRTIETH WHATEVER THAT MONDAY AND TUESDAY ARE. TO DO TRAINING ON THIS TO ALL OF OUR HEARING OFFICERS WE WILL IN HAVE A FEW MONTHS. TO PILOT IT. AND TWEAK IT IS NECESSARY TO SEE HOW IT'S WORKING AND WHAT THE ISSUES ARE BEFORE WE SEE THE INCREASES IN IN SCHEDULED HEARINGS. SO THERE IS KIND OF A STEPPING PROCESS AND WE WILL BE PRESENTING AT PUBLICLY. JUST TO PUT A LAY SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS IT IS NOT A FORMULA THERE'S NO NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. KIND OF THE DESIGN OF THE TOOL THE WAY HE PUTS IT WHICH MAKES SENSE TO ME IF EVERYTHING IF EVERYONE OF THESE KEY DOMAINS COMES UP AS AGGRAVATED AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT GRANTING PAROLE. YOU NEED TO STOP AND REALLY THINK ABOUT IT THIS IT'S NEEDS TO ADD UP AND MAKE SENSE CONVERSELY IF EVERYTHING IS MITIGATING AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DENYING. YOU NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AND THERE IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT DOMAINS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT UNDER THE TOOL IS A FENDER CHANGE SO IT WILL BE VERY OFFENDER SPECIFIC. AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT TAKE AWAY THE PORTION OF OUR HEARING WHICH WE THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT. HOW HAS THIS INMATE TRANSFORMED WHO ARE THEY TODAY AND HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM WHO THEY WERE WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES? SO THAT PART WILL NOT ADMITTEDLY THIS IS NOT HOW WE WOULD NORMALLY DO BUSINESS IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE PROTRACTED WE JUST SAW THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S DO IT SIMILAR TO WHEN WE MIGHT PAPERLESS THERE WAS NO PLAN B.. BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD NOT. THEY WOULDN'T CONVERT TO WRITE SO -- TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. THERE IS THERE IS A RISK FACTOR ADMITTEDLY TO THIS. WHICH IS WHY SUCH I'M ASKING THAT YOU NOT GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF THE YES TO BE DOING PUBLIC HEARINGS. GIVEN OUR SCHEDULES WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE SO COULD KEEP A LITTLE BIT CLOSER LETTING US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON CHALLENGE ME WOULD GIVE US A LOT MORE COMFORT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE. INVESTING IN A CHANGE YES AND THE AND FONG SOMETHING WELL WORTH US KEEPING TRACK. ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL ON THE SECOND PANEL NOW AND THEN WE CAN -- WAS AT THE END OF THAT WHEN WE HAVE IS IF THEY'RE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT -- THE SECOND PANEL IS SOMEONE FOR THE BORDER. PATROL PATROL PAROLE HEARING. THIS YOU. PROFESSOR HEIDI ROMMEL WHO IS WITH USC SO GOALS OF SCHOOL SCHOOL OF LAW. A POST CONVICTION JUSTICE PROJECT. AND KEEP WIDELY WHO IS WITH UNCOMMON LAW. AND THEN MICHAEL MENDOZA WHOSE AND I WAS THE RECIDIVISM COALITION -- WANNA GIVE EACH ONE OF YOU JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO INTRODUCE YOUR YOUR YOUR ISSUE -- WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT -- AND THEN WE CAN GO INTO A CONVERSATION OKAY HOW. EXCELLENT GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS HAITI RUMMEL I RUN THE POST CONVICTION JUSTICE PROJECT AT USC LAW SCHOOL -- WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUDENTS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS M. IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE BEEN PERSONALLY INVOLVED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX SO I HAVE REALLY BEEN PRESENT FOR THE THE DEVELOPMENTS IN IN IN PAROLE WHEN I STARTED DOING THESE HEARINGS -- THE GRANT RATE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY LOW -- THE MOST DESERVING CLIENTS ARE NOT. BEING FOUND SUITABLE FOR PRO THERE WAS ALMOST NO HOPE OF REALLY BEING FOUND SUITABLE FOR PAROLE AND IT WAS REALLY A CRAPSHOOT WE BROUGHT A LOT OF LEGAL CHALLENGES UNDER THE IN THE COURTS -- AND THROUGH THAT LITIGATION AND THEN ULTIMATELY REALLY GOVERNOR BROWN BECOMING THE GOVERNOR AND MYSTERY FOR TAKING OVER THE BOARD -- WE STARTED TO SEE -- SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS INCREASES TRANSPARENCY COLLABORATION -- AND A REAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROPUESTAS SO BEFORE I WENT INTO MY CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT COULD BE BETTER OR DIFFERENT I DO WANNA -- REALLY GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THAT WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAD GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AGO -- I ALSO DO A LOT OF WORK INSIDE THE PRISONS DOING WORKSHOPS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THE THE LAWS THAT HAVE -- EXPANDED THE PROPOSED SAYS EXPANDED IT FOR YOUTH OFFENDERS AND I'VE BEEN INSIDE MANY OF THE PRISONS IN CALIFORNIA PRESENTING TO PEOPLE ON WHAT IT TAKES TO BE -- SHIFT IN PEOPLE IN IN IN MEN AND WOMEN INSIDE PRISONS WANTING TO CHANGE AND GROW AND REHABILITATE AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED IN MY OPINION TO THE FACT THAT THE PAROLE BOARD IS WORKING VERY HARD TO TRY TO SEND THE RIGHT PEOPLE HOME AND DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF SENDING. THE RIGHT PEOPLE HOME SO I WILL START WITH THAT -- I HAVE MY I HAVE I HAVE. SOME -- I THINK MY BIGGEST I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS TO MISS SCHAEFER AND BEFORE MISS A FOR WAS THE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER THAT THE BIGGEST -- FACTOR IN SOMEONE GETTING A FAIR PAROLE HEARING IS HAVING A GOOD ATTORNEY I WANT TO SPEND JUST A MINUTE EXPLAINING TO WHAT. IN OUR PROJECT WE DO WHEN WE REPRESENT PEOPLE IN THE PRO PROCESS WE'VE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLIENTS RELEASED THROUGH THE LIFE APPROVAL PROCESS. THE GRANT RATE FOR OUR PROJECT IT RUNS AROUND 7275% OF OUR CLIENTS ARE GRANTED PAROLE WHEN THEY GO HEARING. AND WE DO NOT SELECT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO GET PAROLE OR WHO HAVE. ACCOMPLISHED THE MOST PERFECT CHANGE WE REALLY HAVE A RANGE OF CLIENTS -- BUT WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF OUR STUDENTS SPENDING MANY HOURS PREPARING THEIR CLIENTS FOR PAROLE HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. GAINING THEIR TRUST -- AND MAKING SURE THEY ARE READY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE PUT TO THEM IN THE IN THE PRO PROCESS. IS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE MANY PEOPLE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM COGNITIVE CHALLENGES HAVE CHALLENGES THAT COME FROM TRAUMA BEING RAISED IN TRAUMA HAVE VERBAL PROCESSING DISORDERS AND HAVE ALL KINDS OF OF ISSUES. THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE APPARENT IN A PRO PROCESS BUT WOULD INHIBIT THEM FROM GOING INTO THE BOARD ROOM AND TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO TALK ABOUT. SO I ECHO ISTY FOR HIS COMMENT ABOUT ATTORNEY PAROLE REPRESENTATION THE CRITICAL THE MOST VALUE AN ATTORNEY CAN ADD TO THE PROCESS. IS THE TIME SPENT WITH THEIR CLIENT PRIOR TO THE HEARING MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE HEARING. EARNING THEIR TRUST SO THEY CAN TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED CHILDHOOD TRAUMA CAUSATIVE FACTORS -- SEXUAL ABUSE ADDICTION AND THE THINGS THAT LED TO THE VIOLENCE BEING ABLE TO HONESTLY AND OPENLY DISCUSS THE VIOLENCE THAT THEY PERPETRATED BOTH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT FOR WHAT THEY'VE NOT BEEN. CAUGHT FOR AND THEN BEING ABLE TO DISCUSS THEIR CHANGE -- ONCE YOU'RE IN THE BOARDROOM OBVIOUSLY HAVING A STRONG ATTORNEY WHO KNOWS THE LAW AND WILL FIGHT FOR YOU MATTERS IT CAN I THINK IT KEEPS THE COMMISSIONERS -- IN THEIR LANE AND FOLLOWING THE RULES AND AND PAYING ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION. TO BUT THE TRAVEL TO AND FROM% THE PRISON THE FAMILIARITY WITH THE LARGE PRISON FILE AND THE RECORDS RELATED TO THE CRIME -- AND THE CLIENT PREPARATION IS WHAT'S CRITICAL AND PAROLE REPRESENTATION MY COMMENT WOULD BE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS EVEN WHEN YOU. AGGREGATE ALL OF THE ANY FIRST OF ALL THAT'S DIFFICULT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HEARINGS A WEEK AND MORE THAN TWO A DAY. ON IN MY OPINION BUT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO COVERING WHAT SOMEONE REALLY NEEDS -- IN TERMS OF BEING FOR THE FOR THE PRO BOARD PRIVATE ATTORNEYS RATES I THINK I MISSED ABOUT THE COMPOSITE SPEAK TO THIS BETTER THAN I CAN. VERY WOULD SAY FROM 300-021-0000 DOLLARS FOR OUT FOR A PAROLE HEARING THERE WAS AN EMPIRICAL STUDY THAT A SOURCE FELLOW OUT OF USC RAN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SHOWING THAT THE GRANT RATES. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE RETAINED ATTORNEYS COMPARED TO THE GREAT RATES FOR PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE TO THE PROVIDE WITH BOARD ATTORNEYS IS NEARLY DOUBLE FOR THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE. IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALMOST DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO GET IT A PAROLE DATE AND YOU TAKE WITH PEOPLE WHO ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL GET A PRO DATE. THAT SORT OF MIDDLE GROUP WHERE THERE'S SOME GRAY THE GRANT RATES ARE MORE THAN DOUBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE OF RETAINED ATTORNEY -- WORKING FOR THEM. AND IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS HAVING MISSED A FOR DID A GOOD JOB OF OUTLINING FEW SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THE FACT THAT THE BOARD ITSELF. HIRES SUPERVISES -- AND PAYS AND IT IS IS OBVIOUSLY A YOU KNOW A HUGE PROBLEM I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THE DETAILS ON THAT I THINK SEPARATING THOSE FUNCTIONS WOULD BE. WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THE YOU KNOW THERE'S LIMITS IN THE KIND OF TRAINING THAT THE BOARD CAN -- PROVIDE BECAUSE YOU ARE TRAINING PEOPLE TO LITIGATE SORT OF LITIGATE AGAINST YOU I MEAN ESSENTIALLY LITIGATE AGAINST YOU -- MISTER WELL AND I'VE TEAMED UP TO DO TRAINING FOR THE GOODNESS OF OUR HEARTS WE'RE BOTH REALLY BUSY WE HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR A FEW YEARS IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S ONEROUS IT'S HARD TO GET THE ATTORNEYS TO ATTEND -- I COULD REGALE YOU WITH STORIES OF PEOPLE I'VE MET IN PRISON AND CLIENTS HAD TAKEN OVER THEIR CASES THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH BOARD LAWYERS -- THAT SOMETIMES JUST MAKE ME WANNA CRY -- IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE ALL BAD AND IT'S NOT THAT THERE ARE NOT WORKING HARD BUT THERE ARE SOME. TERRIBLE TERRIBL STORIES ABOUT THE LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION THAT SOMEONE CAN EXPECT TO GET WITH THE BOARD APPOINTED ATTORNEY. SO I COMMEND THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE REPRESENTATION I DON'T THINK SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IS ENOUGH -- I THINK IT'S A START BUT I THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE MOVING FORWARD SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A BIGGER. BROADER SOLUTION TO THAT SITUATION AND IN IN THIS YOU KNOW WHAT IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT COST -- A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PRISON SEEKING PAROLE THAT FIRST PAROLE HEARING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD REPRESENTATION IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT THEY POSE A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY IT'S THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT READY TO PRESENT THEIR NARRATIVE TO THE BOARD. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR THEM AND THEN THEY GET THEIR THREE DENIAL AND THEY HAVE TO GO BACK FOR A SECOND HEARING WHICH IS ALSO HUGELY EXPENSIVE TO THE STATE -- WE GO IN THE WE GOING TO WORKSHOPS IN THE PRISONS WITH MY LAW STUDENTS AND EIGHT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR MEDIA COMMENT FROM THE STUDENT LIKE WE COULD GET HIM A DATE. BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO GET A DATE THE FIRST TIME AROUND WITH HIS BOARD ATTORNEY HAVE PROBABLY GET FOUND SUITABLE THE SECOND TIME AROUND BECAUSE HE'S HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROCESS HE DOESN'T HOW TO PRESENT HIMSELF HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. THAT BEING HONEST ABOUT. YOU KNOW HE FROM. CHILDHOOD TRY COULD REALLY HELP INSTEAD OF HER HIM OR BEING OPEN ABOUT THE MISCONDUCT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS -- SO I I ECHO THE NEED FOR AN IMPROVEMENT IN ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION I THINK IT'S THE SINGLE LARGEST FACTOR THAT WILL IMPROVE OUR PRO PROCESS LEAD TO MORE OF THE CREW THE RIGHT PEOPLE BEING GRANTED PAROLE -- AND ULTIMATELY COULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF REDUCING ON THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE NECESSARY LET US HEAR FROM US TO WHAT WE THEM WHOSE BECAUSE MISTER WHAT LIVE ABOUT OKAY YES. UHHUH. GOOD AFTERNOON I I BUT ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT PROFESSOR FROM HIS -- SHARED I I HAVE BEEN. DOING THIS WORK -- FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OR SO I'M THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ON COMMON LAW IT'S A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WE PROVIDE. COUNSELING LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE WHO APPEARED BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD -- I'VE HANDLED HUNDREDS OF OF HEARINGS IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME. I I ORDINARILY PERVERT NOT A GROUP TO USE NOTES BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I PROVIDE CONTEXT AT THAT AS I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS BUDGET CHANGE RIPPLES REALLY BECOME RELEVANT -- AND MORE OBVIOUSLY RELEVANT TO ME -- FAIRLY RECENTLY IT HAS TO DO WITH -- FOR ONE OF THE WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS THIS THIS BOARD SHOULD BE ASKING THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE ASKING WHICH IS -- WHY SHOULD SHOULD WE GIVE THE BOARD? MORE MONEY [inaudible] TWO TO FURTHER A PROCESS THAT HAS NEVER REALLY PRODUCED THE STATUTORILY MANDATED RESULT. THE PENAL CODE SECTION THAT GOVERNS THIS PROCESS IS. THIRTY FORTY ONE IT TELLS THE BOARD TO NORMALLY GRANT PAROLE THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE APPEARS FOR PAROLE. THE BOARD IS NEVER APPROACH THAT. THAT RATE -- AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING IS THAT -- THERE ARE THEIR APPROACHES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HOW DO WE HOLD MORE HEARINGS NOT HOW DO WE RELEASE MORE PEOPLE. AND THIS THIS TODAY'S PROPOSALS IS VERY SIMILAR -- TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FOR THE PROCESS FOR FOR GETTING SOMEONE READY FOR THIS FOR FOR HEARING -- I AM A LAWYER BY TRAINING BUT MOST OF MY WORK WITH MY CLIENTS THIS IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE I'M A PRETTY GOOD LISTENER AND I'M OF A COUNSELOR -- I GUIDE THEM INTO THIS INTROSPECT THE DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES THEY HAD IN THEIR THEIR OWN CHILDHOODS AND ADOLESCENCE AND HOW THAT THEN IMPACT THEIR DECISIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS AND AND ACTIONS. LATER IN LIFE -- WHAT I FIND IS THIS WORK TAKES MONTHS -- SOMETIMES YEARS -- BUT WE ARE FILLING A CRITICAL GAP IN THE AVAILABLE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE OFTENTIMES PEOPLE HAVE NO ACCESS. TO HELP ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS NOR SAFE SPACE TO DO THAT TO DO THAT WORK. AND WHAT I THE THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IDENTIFIES THE THE BOARD'S CURRENT PROGRAM GREAT THEY HEARD THE SHAPER MENTION THAT A HIGHER NUMBER TODAY -- MAYBE THAT'S AN UPDATED NUMBER -- BUT OUR RESULTS TELL US THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- WORKS YOU KNOW WE HAVE -- AS BASS RUMBLE SAID. OUR OUR RATES ARE PRETTY HIGH LAST YEAR WE'RE 81% OF OUR CLIENTS WERE GRANTED PAROLE IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE CHOOSE THE BEST CLIENTS EITHER -- WE COULD JUST ASK THE PERSON WHO I WORK WITH FOR TEN YEARS OF THE PERSON WHO HAVE MET WHEN HE WAS ABOUT A GANG MEMBER THE SHOE OR THE PERSON WHO HAD A HIGH PROFILE CASE FOR THE PERSON WHO'S -- WHO STEADFASTLY DENIED GUILT? ON HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IN THE PAROLE BOARD WE DON'T CHERRY PICK. IT'S BECAUSE WE DO THE WORK. THAT HELPS OUR PLANTS ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THE PAROLE BOARD IS INTERESTED. AND AGAIN WE'RE FILL AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THAT -- OF SOME OF MY COMMENTS ARE FOCUSED ON ON THIS EFFORT TO INCREASE. THE BOARDS ABILITY TO HOLD MORE HEARINGS THEY THEY ARE ASKING FOR TWO MORE COMMISSIONER POSITIONS. THIS IS A A FAMILIAR REQUEST -- WAY BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE THERE WAS A BACKLOG OF OVER TWO HEARINGS THAT WAS DUE TO INEFFICIENCIES IN SCHEDULING HEARINGS AND THE FACT THAT THE TIME IS MISS ROMMEL NOTED. THE PROGRAM RATE WAS AROUND 1%. AT THAT TIME 1%. AND THE GOVERNOR TO TIMES REVERSING ALMOST ALL THOSE BUT PROGRAM RAY THE BOARD WAS ABOUT AND AT THE TIME THERE WERE NINE POSITIONS ON THE BOARD NINE COMMISSIONERS -- SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT PASS AND ALLOW THEM TO TO SPLIT PANEL SO YOU COULD HAVE ONE COMMISSIONER HERE CASE AND A DEPUTY COMMISSIONER. SO THEY COULD HEAR MORE TO TRY TO ELIMINATE THE BACK. THE BACKLOG HAD ACTUALLY INCREASED. TOPPING FOUR THOUSAND OVERDUE CASES. SOME BY OVER TO BUY A YEAR OR MORE -- AND IN THAT YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIVE SENATE BILL SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMMISSIONERS SO THEY COULD CATCH UP. THEY WENT FROM NINE COMMISSIONERS TO TWELVE COMMISSIONERS AT THAT POINT. THREE YEARS LATER THE BOARD INCREASE THE NUMBER COMMISSION TO GET. FROM. TWELVE TO FIFTEEN NOW WHAT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY INTERESTING AT THAT TIME IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE BOOK WAS PROJECTING ROUGHLY THE SAME NUMBER HEARINGS WOULD BE DO. SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED AS THEY ARE NOW SAYING WILL BE DUE NEXT YEAR OF SO. IN THE PROVIDE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR PROPOSED BUDGET THEY'RE ASKING FOR TWO MORE COMMISSIONER POSITIONS. TO HANDLE BASICALLY THE SAME NUMBER OF HEARINGS AS WERE TO ELEVEN YEARS AGO -- IN OTHER WORDS. IS THIS CAR PROPOSAL. WITH IT THE NUMBER OF COMMISSIONS WILL HAVE NEARLY DOUBLED. FROM NINE TO SEVENTEEN OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. AND THEY'RE STILL PROPOSED THE SAME SOLUTION. MEANWHILE. THE PROGRAM RATE. HAS NOW RISEN TO IT'S STILL BELOW 20%. 18% IS WHAT THEY'RE BUDGET CHANGE HOLES AS AT HOME PAGE. TEN UP AND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE PROPOSALS OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS. HAS SUGGESTED A WAY TO INCREASE. THE MOST OBVIOUS FIX IS THE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. BUT THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO DATE HOW DO WE JUST ADD MORE. CAPACITY TO HEAR MORE CASES AND I SUGGESTTHAT THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE WILL OF THE TRAUMA WORK THAT WE DO. WITH OUR WITH OUR CLIENTS -- THAT WORK. I WAS IS NOT JUST DEPEND ON THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS BUT YOU KNOW YOU YOU HEARD LAST WEEK BUT IN THE SAME COMMITTEE FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE. WHO PROVIDE SERVICES WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS OF DEALING WITH THIS TRUMP -- THE WORK MAKES A DIFFERENCE IT'S A CRITICAL MISSING PIECE AND I WOULD I WOULD URGE IS THAT THIS THAT THE EPA'S WORK WITH CDC R. AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ADDRESS THAT -- AND THAT THE PROPOSAL ACTUALLY REFLECT AN INTEREST IN -- EXPLORING THE WEIGHT OF TO BETTER COMPLY WITH THE LAW NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S RIGHT BUT ACTUALLY REQUIRE -- AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S A MAJOR MISSING PIECE OF FROM THIS. I ALSO THINK THAT -- SOME PEOPLE SAY AND THEY'VE THEY'VE TOLD ME THIS MANY TIMES BECAUSE I I'VE BEEN INVOLVED A LOT OF LITIGATION -- DEALING WITH THE PRO ABORT THIS A LITIGATION IS THE WAY TO MOVE THAT NEEDLE. TWO OF TWO TO PUSH THE BOARD CLOSER TO GRANTING PAROLE MORE OFTEN -- IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT -- AND THEY'VE BEEN HUNDREDS OF COURT CASES OVER THE YEARS SUCCESSFUL ONES. THAT HAVE. IN THE LAST ALMOST TWENTY YEARS PUSH THE PROGRAM RATE FROM 1% CAN'T GET THEIR IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET THERE BY ITSELF BUT I THINK THAT. THROUGH OF BETTER COORDINATION WE CAN GET FOR EXAMPLE A LITTLE LITIGATION IS. IT'S NOT ONLY NOT ENOUGH IT ACTUALLY GETS IN THE WAY. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT CASES ARE USUALLY LITIGATED BY YOU KNOW ON SKILLED LITIGANTS WITHOUT THE HELP OF COMPETENT COUNSEL. CLASS ACTIONS -- AT THE EVENTUAL UNFORTUNATELY PRODUCED REALLY LIMITED RESULTS I THINK WELL HAVING A CHILLING EFFECT. ON OPEN DIALOGUE AND COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS UP. AND SO I THINK THE SOLUTION LIES IN IN -- LEGISLATION OTHER POLICY CHANGES THAT WHAT WOULD WOULD CHANGE THOSE THINGS. I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT -- ABOUT THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING -- I APPRECIATE AND AGREE WITH THE LA OWES OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION. ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION TRAINING AND AND EVALUATION -- IN DISCUSSING THE B. PAGES INTENTION TO INTRODUCE THIS MODEL. THEY SAY THAT -- IT IS. EVIDENCE BASED -- BUT WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS USE ON A POPULATION I CALIFORNIA'S LIFERS AND AND HOW CAN YOU. HOW CAN YOU CLAIM IT CLAIM REALLY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PROPOSED FRAME WORK WHEN YOU HAVEN'T YET CUSTOMIZE IT FOR CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUES UNIQUE LAWS AND POPULATION WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ENOUGH -- YET AND I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING LEARN A LOT MORE -- I'D ALSO NOTE THAT WITH THE STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THEY'RE PROJECTING. THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SCHEDULE ELEVEN HEARINGS PER WEEK AT LEVEL TWO AND THREE PRISONS AND FOURTEEN HEARINGS. HELLO FOR PRISONS. WHICH IS ACTUALLY FEWER HEARINGS THAN THEY WERE HOLDING EACH LEE EACH WEEK WHEN THE BACK WHILE I WAS AT FOUR THOUSAND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MATH WORKS -- I LOOK FOR LEARNING MORE BUT FROM WHAT I SEE IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK -- THE THE THREE APPOINTMENT PROCESS. I AGREE THAT THAT -- THEY HAVE A PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE CHANGES -- WILL RESULT IN BETTER REPRESENTATION -- I KNOW THAT THEIR FEE SCHEDULE -- AS IT IS CALLED FOR SINGLE INTERVIEW WITH THE CLIENT I HOPE THAT CHANGES -- THEY PUT THEIR PAID -- THAT FOR THE INTERVIEW WITH THE CLIENT THEN THEY ARE FOR SHOWING UP AT THE HEARING BUT YOU'VE HEARD REALLY ALL OF US. AGREED THAT THE PART OF THE PROCESS DURING WHICH ATTORNEYS HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT. IS IN THE LEAD UP TO THE HERE MONTHS SOMETIMES AN A AND R. CASES YEARS SOMETIMES -- AND ONE THEIR COUPLE EASY CHANGES AYE IF THE EASY FEET RELATIVELY EASY FIX. ONE IS THAT YOU IF YOU REQUIRE THE ATTORNEYS ACTUALLY REVIEW THE RISK ASSESSMENTS WITH THEIR CLIENTS. EARLY ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY HELP THEM PREPARE FOR THE YEAR. AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES A MENTAL ILLNESS -- A COUPLE OTHER. QUICK WHAT I THINK A RELATIVELY EASY EASY FIXES -- ONE IS -- TO INCLUDE A BUDGET ITEM -- FOR TRANSLATING PAROLE HEARING TRANSCRIPTS AND RISK ASSESSMENTS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. THE BOARD PROVIDES INTERPRETERS. FOR THE HEARINGS BUT THEY DON'T TRANSLATE RISK ASSESSMENTS OR HEARING TRANSCRIPTS INTO A LANGUAGE THE PERSON CAN UNDERSTAND. SO THEY'RE UNABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CRITICAL INFORMATION THOSE DOCUMENTS TO IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES THE NEXT TIME. ANOTHER IDEA IS TO TO BETTER SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES A MENTAL ILLNESS -- THAT CAN INVOLVE SPECIALLY TRAINED ATTORNEYS. ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS PREPARING RISK ASSESSMENTS AND MORE HELP WITH POST RELEASE PLANNING -- AND THEY SHOULD REALLY START BY TRACKING AND REPORTING HEARING OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE IN THESE. CATEGORIES -- AND I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WITH WITH WHAT I THINK ARE [inaudible] BROADER RECOMMENDATIONS -- BECAUSE MUCH THE DISCUSSION I THINK. IT TENDS TO FOCUS ON WHAT. COULD AMOUNT TO SORT OF TAKE IT AROUND THE TIKRIT AROUND THE EDGES OF PRO REFORM BUT I DO THINK -- IN I WAS IN THIS IS THIS IS NOT A POLICY HEARING THIS IS ABOUT THE ABOUT THE BUDGET. BUT IF WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE BOTTOM LINE. AND IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY THERE COUPLE RECOMMENDATIONS. ONE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE TIES INTO LAST WEEK'S HEARING -- AND IT RECORD I RECOMMEND BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN BPH AND CDC ARE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE PRISONS ARE IN LINE WITH THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE TO HEAL FROM TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. AND ADDRESS OTHER ISSUES BPH WANTS TO SEE RESOLVED BEFORE RELEASING THEM -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT THERE SHOULD BE WIDER SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS TO COME IN AND FILL THAT GAP -- THAT'S WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN OUR SUCCESS RATE COMPARED TO OTHER ATTORNEYS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I RECOMMEND THE USE OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND THERAPIST IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS LEADING UP TO PAROLE HEARINGS. IT'S A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT ROLE THAN THE ATTORNEY. I HAVE ALMOST AS MANY SOCIAL WORKERS ON MY TEAM IS THAT DO LAWYERS BUT LIKE -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE WORD COMES FROM. AND THAT'S THE MISSED THE BIGGEST GAP TO BE FILLED -- AND THEN THE LAST THING IS IS THAT I RECOMMENDED THE BOARD WORK WITH US TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT ENSURES EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION FOR THOSE APPEARING FOR FOR OF THE BOARD -- I THINK THE BETTER OUTCOME SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS WITH TREMENDOUS COST SAVINGS OUR OUR EFFORTS -- WITH OUR CLIENTS WE'VE HAD TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN OF OUR LIFE SENTENCE CLIENTS RELEASED SO FAR. EVERY YEAR THEY STAY OUT OF PRISON SAVE THE STATE SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. JUST OUR GROUP -- YOUR MISS RUMBLE TALK ABOUT THEIR NUMBERS THAT IT ADDS UP REALLY QUICKLY -- SO WE'RE WE'RE INTERESTED IN IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOLUTIONS THAT THE SAME THING OVER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR MENDOZA YOU HAVE A COMMENT. YEAH I'LL TRY TO MAKE A BRIEF THANK YOU THANKS FOR YOUR TIME -- JUST A BRIEF HISTORY AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN I WAS ARRESTED TRIED AND CONVICTED AS AN ADULT. SINCE IT'S TWO FIFTEEN TO LIFE SENTENCE AND SPENT ALL MY TIME IN ADULT PRISON -- AND IS THE THIRD BEEN MENTIONED DURING THAT TIME -- BEFORE THE SHIFT IN THE BEACH BPH PROCESS. THERE WAS A VERY NEGATIVE MESSAGE SENT TO MOST PEOPLE THAT. YOU WOULD NEVER GO HOME BECAUSE OF CERTAIN. LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF THE THE WAY THAT THE BOARD WAS WAS MOSTLY MADE UP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OF TIME. AND SO REALLY. IN TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THE BOARD IT WAS A HOPELESS GOAL AT THAT TIME. IT SEEMS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. TO EVER EARN YOUR WAY HOME OR TO PROVE THAT YOU WERE NO LONGER THE INDIVIDUAL WHO. MADE A REALLY REALLY BAD DECISION -- BUT AS TIME IS CHANGING THINGS THAT CHANGED. OTHER HAVE BEEN A FEW THINGS THAT HAVE STAYED THE SAME AND ONE OF THEM IS A C. FILE. ARE YOU SEE FOLLOW IT'S BASICALLY YOUR LIFE IN A FILE IN BLACK AND WHITE. AND IT'S A C. FILE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE GONE OVER -- BY AN ATTORNEY WHO IS GOING TO ADVOCATE FOR YOU -- ALL OF THE BOARD MEMBERS -- TO REALLY BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER YOU ARE. NO LONGER THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE A REALLY BAD DECISION AND COMMITTED A CRIME. AND THE DIFFICULT PART ABOUT THAT IS IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE ASSIGNED AN ATTORNEY MAYBE A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS IF YOU'RE LUCKY OR EVEN CLOSER TO YOUR BOARD HEARING -- IT'S IT'S NOT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO REALLY GO OVER DECADES OF WHAT'S IN YOUR C. FILE. TO ASSESS YOU AS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO YOU ARE. IN PERSON -- BEFORE THE BOARD -- TO RELEASE GET IT THAT ASSESSMENT -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE FOR FOR MYSELF. I DID EVERYTHING IN MY POWER THAT I COULD. TO WRITE MANY MANY LETTERS ASKING. ANY ATTORNEY THAT WOULD TAKE MY CASE PRO BONO. BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF OF A STATE APPOINTED ATTORNEY -- HEARING EVERYTHING THAT I WOULD HEAR FROM -- MANY MEN WHO WERE INSIDE WITH ME ABOUT THEIR HORROR STORIES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE OF A STATE APPOINTED ATTORNEY -- THEY WOULD BE LUCKY TO SEE THEM ONCE BEFORE THE BOARD HEARING -- THEY WOULD TELL ME ABOUT HOW UNPREPARED SOME OF BOARD TURNS WOULD BE -- NOT ALL OF THEM WERE REALLY. ADD TO THAT PART BUT I DIDN'T WANT EXPERIENCE THAT. AND SO I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE. TWO ATTORNEYS ON BOTH MY HERE IS THAT WERE PRO BONO -- AND BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM MORE THAN ONCE -- WAS VERY VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR ME. IT ALLOW ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE [inaudible] TO PREPARE HOW. MY ANSWERS WILL BE IN TERMS OF REAL INSIGHT THE REAL DRAMATIC WORK THAT BEEN ABLE TO DO THROUGHOUT MANY DECADES IN PRISON. TO SHOW THAT I WAS NO LONGER THAT PERSON -- IS SO I THINK IN TERMS OF PREPARATION -- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A PROCESS WHERE. YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA PROVIDE LEGAL COUNSEL DURING THE HEARING -- AND ALLOW YOU TO FOCUS ON THE ACTUAL WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING ON THE INSIDE LAWYER PRESENT. SO WE LOOK AT THOSE THINGS AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE HEARING ITSELF -- THE THAT THE HEARING COULD BE AT THE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AS THE JOB INTERVIEW OF A LIFETIME. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERVIEW OF YOUR LIFE. AND YOU HAVE TO REALLY FOCUS ON ON WHO YOU ARE AT THAT MOMENT. AND SO YOU HAVE MADE ABOUT THREE TO FOUR HOURS. TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOUR STORY WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON -- INTO. REALLY. PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY ON INDIVIDUALS BOARD MEMBERS AND ATTORNEYS. TO BASE THAT OFF OF C. FALL WITHIN THREE HOURS OR WHATEVER TIME IS SPENT ON BEFORE THEY IS IT IS UNFAIR. I I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE TIME ALLOCATED ON ALL OF THIS THE PARTIES. WHO ARE TRYING TO ASSESS INDIVIDUAL ANOTHER HUMAN BEING ON THE CHANGES THAT THEY HAVE MADE -- TO PREPARE TO GO HOME. AND SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT MAKE THE PROCESS TO PREPARE. FOR A THREE HOUR HEARING. VERY VERY DIFFICULT. AND SO THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT I THINK CAN BE DONE DIFFERENTLY -- ONE IS TO ALLOW ATTORNEYS OR STATE APPOINTED ATTORNEYS TO BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR CLIENTS. TO GO OVER WHAT'S IN THERE SEE FILE WHAT'S MISSING IN THE CITY FATHERS SOMEBODY. A LOT OF TIMES THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT DON'T GOING TO SEE FILE WHICH IS WHY IT'S NORMAL. TWO THERE'S A PRACTICE NOT AMONG THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO THE BOARD TO CREATE THEIR OWN FILE THE FOLDER. TO PRESENTED TO THE BOARD. BECAUSE NOBODY'S GOING TO ENSURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO GOOD WHILE YOU'RE IN PRISON. ISN'T A PACKET MORE THAN THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY DOING THOSE THINGS -- SO IN ORDER TO TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE WHILE IN PRISON IS NOTED. THEN MOST OF THE TIME INDIVIDUALS -- CREATE THEIR OWN PACKAGE. TO PRESENT -- SO I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S A EASIER PROCESS TO REALLY. MAKE THE HEARING MORE PERSONABLE SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO KNOW YOU. AS A PERSON MORE THAN. JUST YOUR C. FILE OKAY THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS YES MY SYSTEM THANK YOU. SOMETHING I'M NOT QUITE TRACKING. BECAUSE LOOK AT SOME LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE DONE WE ARE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THE MISS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. TALK ABOUT NOT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT WOULD BE BE BETTER TO HAVE FEWER HERE. AND I'M -- I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THAT SINCE WE WE'VE BEEN. WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING SHOULD BE GIVING MORE ACCESS TO HEARINGS AND AND GIVE MORE PEOPLE THE ABILITY? TO TO HAVE THAT HEARING IN ORDER TO GO TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT SO I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT A LITTLE BIT BETTER PEOPLE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE HAVING. AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR CASES HEARD YEAH. BUT IF ULTIMATELY MOST ARE DENIED PAROLE WHICH THEY ARE. THEN YOU HAVEN'T REALLY IMPROVE THE PROCESS YOU'VE SPENT IT UP. BUT IF THE RESULTS ARE ABOUT THE SAME WHICH THE THEY HAVE THEY IT'S TRUE THEY HAVE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED. IF 1% 220% IS DRAMATIC AND I THINK I THINK IT IS. BUT IT'S NOT NORMALLY GRANTING PAROLE AND SO I'M MORE I'M INTERESTED IN NOT JUST. THIS ACCOMMODATING MORE PEOPLE. IT IS A COMMON WAY SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO FIVE OR EIGHT OR TEN PAROLE HEARINGS BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY GET RELEASED. OKAY SIDE SO I THINK I UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC BETTER AYE. I AM ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN. IN GETTING MORE BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS RATE IN. AND HAVING THAT BE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE DONE THE WORK AND TO MAKE A CASE WHICH AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON BUILDING. AROUND THE REHABILITATION ONE OF THE VAST. I TRACTORS TO DOING THE PROGRAMMING THAT WE WANT TO DO AND WE ARE WORKING AS WE TALK ABOUT LAST UP ON THE PROGRAMMING ITSELF IN ENSURING THAT THAT. IS FUNCTIONAL THAT IT IS WORKING THAT DAY IS GOING TO LEAD TO THE OUTCOMES WE WOULD EXPECT. BUT ONE OF THE BEST INCENTIVES IS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET PAROLE AND TO GET TO HEARING IT AND TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT IT IS AS I'VE BEEN INSIDE A TALKING INTO THE JEWELS. THEY'RE MUCH MORE EXCITED ABOUT DOING SOME THE PROGRAMMING BECAUSE THEY KNOW THERE'S SOME HOPE OUT THERE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ULTIMATELY TRYING TO LOOK AT SO YES THE THE OUTCOMES AND AND THEN TO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT. THAT. WE TEND IT GOVERNOR WE TEND THE STOVE PIPE THINGS AND THIS IS WHAT IT BEGINS TO FEEL LIKE THAT IT WE'RE LOOKING AT PROGRAMMING INSIDE. SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN WORK ON THE TRAUMA THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY'VE HAD AND THAT'S SORT OF THROW IT OVER TO A PAROLE HEARING. WHEN IF WE DECIDE TO A BETTER? CAN TAKE YOU SYSTEM THAT THAT ARTICULATED BETWEEN THE TWO WE WHAT I WOULD HOPE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE [inaudible] THAT. PROGRAMMING THAT LEADS TO THE THE REHABILITATION THAT HAVE A LOT OF THAT WORK BUILD INTO BUILDING YOUR OWN FILE BUILDING TO BUILDING YOUR OWN. ABILITY AS A PRISONER TO MAKE THAT CASE AND SO. ONE STEP TRANSLATES SOURCE SEAMLESSLY INTO THE OTHER AND THAT WOULD LEND FOR MORE TIME. ALSO THE COME ABOUT THE TOURNEY'S VERY WELL TAKE AND THEN WE DEAL WITH ATTORNEYS WEATHER'S DEPENDENCY COUNCIL. LEGAL SERVICE SAYS AND IF THE OTHERS THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HARDEST PRESSED. MOST STRAPPED ATTORNEYS WITHOUT IF THEIR CLIENTS THAT THEY NEED TO SPEND. BUT IF WE CAN SOMEHOW TO A BETTER JOB I THINK OF LINKING. THE PROGRAMMING THAT THAT WE KNOW. WE WANT AND LOOKING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THAT PROGRAM THE THAT PROGRAM AND GETTING SOME RESULTS. THE DECIDED BETTER TO TO FEED INTO WHICH IS WHICH SHOULD BE INTO THE PAROLE PROCESS SO THAT THEY BUILT A BODY OF WORK. AROUND THEMSELVES IT ON THEMSELVES THEY THAT ARE BETTER PREPARED TO GET TO THAT HEARING. JUST LIKE STUDYING FOR THE BAR GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE WILL RIGHT PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THAT ULTIMATE [inaudible] TEST. AND LOOK AT SUCCESS RATES THERE. AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT PROGRESSION THAT ARTICULATION I THINK WE WOULD ULTIMATELY BE BETTER OFF AND I THINK WE CAN SOLVE. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. HOW WE ADDRESS WHAT WE PAY FOR THOSE ATTORNEY BECAUSE I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT? WE HAVE TO ADEQUATELY PAY ATTORNEYS THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST SPENDING ITS WORKLOAD. AND IT'S APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF OF COMPENSATION. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A CAREER AND AND BUILD IT AND STAY WITH IT WITHOUT HAVING TO DO EVERYTHING PRO BONO WITHOUT HAVING. TO GO OUT AND TRY AND FIND SUB SUPPLEMENTAL -- MONIES BECAUSE OF FOR PROVIDING A STATE'S ATTORNEY THAN. THEN THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIND ADEQUATELY THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND I KNOW WE'RE WE ARE DEALING WITH SOME BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AROUND THERE. I THINK WE LINK TITLE THIS TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE GETTING MORE PEOPLE TO HEARINGS THAT ARE THEN SUCCESSFUL. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT PROVIDING THAT INCENTIVE TO DO THE WORK TO DO THE PROGRAMMING INSIDE WHICH WE ALSO HAVE. TO PROVIDE AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT AS WELL THEN I THINK WE HAVE A MUCH MORE SIT SENSIBLE SYSTEM THAT HAS SOME CONTINUITY. TO IT AND SOME RATIONAL'S ABOUT THAT I I WOULD I WOULD ADD -- I'VE NOTICED THAT. ESPECIALLY SINCE MID SHAPERS COME ON BOARD. THAT -- THE BOARD HAS BECOME LESS OF A MYSTERY TO PEOPLE. AND BUT WE ALL APPRECIATE THAT AND AND PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE THEY ACTUALLY SEE THERE'S A PATHWAY. THAT IF THEY CAN DO THIS WORK THEN THEY CAN SHOW UP TO THE BOARD IN A WAY THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE HEARING WHICH WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE NOW THE MISSING PIECES. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM MATIC OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE SO THEY CAN DO THE WORK? YES AND SO AND SO THAT'S THE PART THAT WE NEED TO DO AND THAT'S WHY ALSO THIS STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING. BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE ADDITIONAL HEARINGS WITH THE HOPE OF BUILDING IN THAT SUCCESS SO THAT WE'RE NOT AND I I THINK I I GET YOUR COMMENT NOW ABOUT THAT. THE HEARINGS IS IT'S THE MULTIPLE HEARINGS AROUND AN INDIVIDUAL WE WANT. TO IDEALLY HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE INSIDE TO PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD. AND BE ABLE TO MOVE THOSE NUMBERS SO WERE ESSENTIALLY GRANTING PAROLE WELL DESERVED. FOR MORE OF THE INMATES ARE GOING THROUGH. THAT HELPS WITH OVERCROWDING IF WE DO IT RIGHT IT HELPS WITH RECIDIVISM IT IT TO SORT OF TAX A LOT OF THE BLOCKS. AND THE DISTRICT DECISION MAKING. LOOKS LIKE THAT MAY LEAD INTO THAT BUT I THINK I DON'T UNDERSTAND ENOUGH OF WHAT THAT MEANS AROUND AROUND THIS. AND HOW THAT CAN WORK WITH. HELPING TO GET PEOPLE TO THOSE HEARINGS. REALLY GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO ARTICULATE WHO THEY ARE WHAT CHANGES A BED THROUGH ALL OF THAT WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE INSIDE SO THAT THEY HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY OF SUCCESS. THANK YOU WE HAVE QUESTIONS TO JONES SAWYER. OF WHEN OUR FIRST -- GOT ELECTED I WHICH I HAD THE HONOR OF BEING CHAIR DISK THIS COMMITTEE -- I HAD A FRIEND I HAVE A FRIEND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU STILL WORKS ON THIS. THAT DID TO PROLETER TWO IS WHEN HE ATTORNEYS THAT THEY HIRED. AND THE FIRST THING YOU CAME TO ME AND SAID WE'RE NOT PAID ENOUGH. AND YOU KNOW I JUST. KIND OF TOOK IT LIKE. YOU KNOW OF MY BROTHER ONE TO GET A RAISE YOU JUST TELL ME THIS. AND THEN HE STARTED EXPLAINING THE PROCESS. AND WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO NOW HE'S A TRUE BELIEVER. AND SELL FOR HIM THIS WASN'T PRO BONO JUST WAS HIS LIFE BLOG. OBSESSION THAT HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE GOT AS MANY PEOPLE OUT AS POSSIBLE AND HE HE KEPT GOING ON AND ON ABOUT WE NEED AND I DIDN'T REALIZED. I THOUGHT YOU MEANT LIKE OF A THOUSAND OR TWO THOUSAND MORE I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS. I MEAN WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT YEAH THIS IS THE CHAIR SAID PENNIES ON ON THE DOLLAR. AND AND SO IN NINETEEN DOES. AT MY CONCERN IS MAKING SURE QUALITY -- MY FRIEND SPENT AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME PREPARING FOR EACH OF THESE PAROLE HEARINGS I MEAN IT AND EATING IT PAY FOR IT. AND YOU YOU WANT THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST BECAUSE SAYS SOME PEOPLE SAID YOU GET THIS ONE SHOT. SOME TIME TO GET UP THERE AND MAKE YOUR CASE AND YOU WANT TO HAVE THE BEST REPRESENTATION AND SOMEBODY. DOES REALLY COMMITTED AND SO -- AND I NOTE DEBTS OF PROFESSOR ROMMEL YEAH I'D AN AND I KNOW FOR FOR EXAMPLE YOU YOU COME OUT ONE OF THE BEST LAW SCHOOLS UNIVERSITY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. GOLD BY THE LAW. NO BY GOD NOBODY'S THERE AND BUT HOW DO WE ATTRACT. SOME OF OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST TO WORK IN AND I SAID THIS ABOUT PUBLIC DEFENDING UP OFFERS RIGHT IT IT'S LIKE. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A D. A. A PROSECUTOR IN. AND IN ALL OF THAT BUT HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CARE A LOT ABOUT IT BY THE TIME THEY'RE FINISHED AND YOU GET SOME OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS. BUT YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM YEAH AND THE PEOPLE IF IF CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM YOU NEED TO PAY PEOPLE FOR THE WORK -- AND YOU KNOW I I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING UP THERE'S A THERE'S FOR BELIEVERS NEED TO BE PAID. THANK YOU VERY TO BELIEVE HER DOESN'T GET PAID THAT MUCH FOR THE WORK. EVERYONE SHOULD BE PAID FOR THE WORK -- AND TO BE INCENTIVIZED TO DO THE BEST JOB THAT THEY CAN DO FOR FOR THEIR CLIENTS AND IT'S IT'S CRITICAL I AGREE WITH YOU THAT. IF SOME OF THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES WERE IMPROVED IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE TRAUMA TREATMENT IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WITH COGNITIVE. ISSUES THAT THAT THAT REALLY TRULY INHIBIT THEM IN THE PRO PROCESS IT WOULD MAKE THE ATTORNEYS WORK LAST -- BUT THERE'S STILL A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL OF WORK WHERE YOU HAVE TO HELP YOU CONCRETE THE NARRATIVE BELIEVE IN THEM GET THEM TO TRUST YOU TAKE THEM TO THE BOARD FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS -- AND IF YOU GET INTO YOUR DOESN'T WHILE THE I MEAN THE GRANT WHICH SHOW THAT THERE ARE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER GRANT RATES AND I HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULT CLIENTS WITH DIFFICULT CASES I DON'T JUST PICK THE THE CLIENTS WERE THE EASY. WAY AND THEIR PRESENCE WHERE YOU CAN WALK IN I MEAN THERE WANTED TO PRISONS WHERE YOU CAN WALK IN AND YOU CAN KNOW THAT MOST OF THE MEN YOU'RE GONNA REPRESENT THEIR WE CAN BE A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO GO TO PRO IN YOUR ONLY JOB IS. TO HELP THEM -- IN WHICH THE BUT THEY'VE DONE ALL THE WORK BUT MOST OF THE PLACES WE WALK INTO TO REPRESENT PEOPLE WE ARE PART OF WHAT HELPS THEM. TAKE THAT LAST TWO OR THREE OR FOUR STEPS TO BE WHERE THEY NEED TO BE THAT SHOULDN'T BE TRUE IT SHOULD BE THE PRESENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND THE PRISON SHOULD BE IDENTIFYING PEOPLE COGNITIVE ISSUES AND GETTING THEM THE APPROPRIATE. TESTING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS THAT'S NOT IN PLACE RIGHT NOW -- IT EVEN IF ALL OF THAT WAS PERFECT THERE WOULD STILL BE A MUCH MORE ROBUST SUBSTANTIAL ROLE FOR ATTORNEYS I THINK ESPECIALLY WITH THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING I'M. I'M I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO REALLY WEIGH IN ON IT I AM I AM ENCOURAGED THAT THERE MIGHT BE MORE CONSISTENCY THAT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THE COMMISSIONERS TO EACH BE THINKING ABOUT THE SAME FACTORS. BUT TO SOME EXTENT IT'S GOING TO BE MORE COOKIE CUTTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW IT'S JUST INEVITABLE EVEN IF IT'S NOT A COOKIE CUTTER PROCESS IT'S GONNA. IT'S IT'S IT'S GOOD AND AND THAT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO FALL OUTSIDE THE EDGES OF THE COOKIE CUTTER YOU'RE THE GONNA NEED A GOOD ATTORNEY TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THEIR CASE IN THAT LIMITED TIME WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING BECAUSE IT IS VERY MUCH. NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL PROPOSITION. OKAY -- WE HAVE ANY ONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WANTS TO DO A ONE MINUTE OKAY [inaudible] GOOD ACTORS. GOOD AFTERNOON GOING BACK IS FOR ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS FOLLOWING ON THE COMMENTS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE. IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMMING AND THEREFORE GO AHEAD -- TO THE BOARD FOR POTENTIAL PAROLE -- FOLKS NEED THE INCENTIVE TO PARTICIPATE AND I GET CREDITS. THE CDC ARE HAS DONE A LOT OF TO HAVE THE I. O. DESIGNATIONS. THEY HAVE TO GO TO A CRITERIA PROCESS TO REMOVE THE V. I. O. DESIGNATION SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATING FIRE CAMP. ONCE IN FIRE CAN'T GET A 50% CREDIT. HOWEVER THERE'S NO PEOPLE WHO COULD ALSO QUALIFY IT TO BE I REMOVED BUT THEY'RE NOT ABLE BODIED THEY'RE NOT YOUNG. THEY'RE NOT FIT. THEY'RE NOT. A GOOD FIRE CAMP. THANK YOU SO PARTICIPATING PROGRAMMING THAT REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF PRECIPITATION. AND THEY SHOULD BE BENEFITING FROM THE 50% CREDIT WE DEVELOP A PROPOSAL THAT WE WILL SHARE WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE INSTEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DON KEPT HIM BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIA I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS JUST WITH REGARD TO THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FREE MARK. HOW WE WOULD SHARE OTHER QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ON THE DAILY -- PROPOSED AS WELL AS SOME OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS I JUST REGARDING -- PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK THE DETAILS OF THAT HOW BE USED TO AYE IMPLEMENTED EVALUATED WHAT HAVE YOU I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE BOARD. AS WELL AS ON THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT TIME VICTIMS UNDERSTAND -- KIND OF HOW THAT WILL WORK AND BE DEVELOPED IN UTILIZED AND HOW THAT WILL ACCOUNT FOR VICTIMS SIZE STATEMENTS AND OPPORTUNITY TO BE PRESENT AND HEARD IT VICTIMS -- RATES -- CONSIDERATION. OKAY I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM -- OF FROM THOSE WHO HEAR AN OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S GOOD FOR STAY IN PLACES IS TRANSITIONING CHANGE AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED IN TERMS OF GETTING THE RESULTS WE WANT FROM THE OBVIOUSLY FROM THE PAROLE HEARINGS. IN TERMS OF HIGHER RESULTS MORE FOLKS GETTING OUT AS WELL AS MORE PREPARATION IN ADVANCE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU -- WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AND WORKING WITH THAT I SEE HERE THAT QUESTION FROM LA L. SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET THOSE ANSWERS MAY NOT COME BY. APRIL ONE BUT MAYBE APRIL SECOND. IF IT'S IMPACT OF US IN TERMS OF FUNDING -- AND THE MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS REQUESTED AND WHERE IT'S GOING AND WITHIN THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN TERMS OF THAT. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS GREAT DETAILS ON THE PAROLE HEARING SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OBVIOUSLY YOUR PRINT YOUR PRESENCE THERE HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU KNOW EVEN THOSE WHO ARE COMPLAINING ARE SAYING HE IS SOME CHANGES HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS SHAPE FOR BEING THERE SO WONDERFUL GOOD TO KNOW THAT. ALL RIGHT I THINK THEY HAVE ANOTHER PANEL TO COME NO THE ISSUE THIS THIS THE INMATE LITERACY PROGRAM. I'M GONNA HAVE TO TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO ONE OF YOU. WHO'S GONNA BE A YES WILL BE HERE THIS IS THE LAST ONE THIS IS THE LAST WEEK. OKAY SO ABOUT FIVE MINUTES I'M GONNA HAVE TO RISE UP AND IN MY COLLEAGUES WILL TAKE OVER THIS DEALS WITH THE INMATE LITERACY PROGRAM YES OKAY. YEAH AND I KNOW -- IN THE INTERESTS OF KEEPING THE HEARING SHORT WILL JUST GET RIGHT INTO IT. FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND -- PROPOSAL FOR AND THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS THIS IS TO ESTABLISH AND SUPPORT. IN MADE LITTLE PROGRAMS TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- RYAN SEES -- DEPUTY DIRECTOR DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS I WILL BE BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS -- AS MISTER SWANSON DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION AND THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS BEGINNING IN NINETEEN TWENTY TO ESTABLISH A LITERACY MENTOR PROGRAM ACROSS ALL CDC ARE. A DAHLE INSTITUTIONS -- WE DEFINE AND NEED -- FOR INMATE LITERACY AS ANYONE NOT HAVING THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT TO WITHIN THE DIVISION EVERY WILL TAKE A PROGRAMS WE REALLY WANT THEM TO ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL. IN ORDER -- TO HAVE THE POP MOST POSITIVE EFFECTS UPON RELEASE AT THE TIME OF THE PROPOSAL ABOUT 53% OF OUR INMATE POPULATION READ ABOVE THE NINTH GRADE LEVEL LEAVES 47% NOT AT THE NINTH GRADE LEVEL. AND 62% OF INMATES DO NOT POSSESS A DOCUMENT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR COUPLE AND SEE. THIS PROPOSAL STEMS FROM THOSE FACTS -- THAT WE ULTIMATELY HAVE A CONTINUED NEED TO FOCUS ON LITERACY IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR CREATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY. TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL -- LITERACY NEEDS A VARIETY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SEEKING THAT LITERACY LEVEL BUT NOT ALTERNATELY -- ABLE TO OBTAIN IT AT THIS POINT THIS PROPOSAL -- IS LED BY AN ACCREDITED ACADEMIC TEACHER AND MENTORS WILL GO THROUGH A ROBUST TRAINING INTERNSHIPS AND MENTORING PROGRAM WHERE THEY WERE ON MY ALSO COMPLETION CREDITS. AND ULTIMATELY AN EDUCATIONAL MERIT CREDIT -- FOR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM -- UPON FINAL COMPLETION OF MAINTAIN PAPER THIS POSITIONS ARE COMPATIBLE RATES OTHER HIGHLY REQUESTED WORK ASSIGNMENTS WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS. AGAIN THIS PROPOSAL NOT INTENDED TO SUPPLANT OUR EDUCATIONAL ACCREDITED TEACHERS IT'S REALLY TO CREATE A LITERACY MENTORING PROGRAM WHERE THEY CAN -- FOCUS ON TARGETED NEEDS AND REALLY ACHIEVE THOSE MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY -- EXPEDITIOUSLY IN A PEER TO PEER SETTING ON THIS FLEXIBLE NATURE OF THE SETTING CREATES THE ABILITY FOR MENTORS TO ME AND SMALL GROUPS. AND LOCATIONS THAT ALL PROGRAMMING MAY ALREADY EXIST LIBRARIES PLACES WHERE SPACE CAN REALLY BE FLEXIBLE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS OKAY -- ANYTHING AND ANY ONE FROM FINANCE WITH A COMMENT LA -- THANK YOU -- YET LOOKING FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS NEW THE UNTESTED NATURE OF THE PROGRAM WE'RE RECOMMENDING. APPROVING IT AS A PILOT. THREE HOURS -- FIVE INSTITUTIONS -- SPECIFICALLY WOULD REQUEST OR TO RECOMMEND IT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS. THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR THE PROGRAM BE IMPLEMENTED AT FIVE FACILITIES AND USING. FIVE AN INMATE STUDENTS. WE THINK THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THAT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS USING THAT TEST OF ADULT BASIC EDUCATION -- TO MONITOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM RELATIVE TO OTHER INMATES WHO MAY BE ROLLED IN TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SETTINGS. AS WELL AS IN MAY TO HAVE A NEED FOR ANY LITERACY BUT I'M NOT COMPANY RECEIVING ANY SORT OF PROGRAMMING FOR IT -- IN ADDITION THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT THE INMATE MENTORS ON A CO COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AS PART OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM. WE RECOMMEND REVISING THIS REQUIREMENT SUCH THAT ONLY EMIT MENTOR TO HAVING THIS TEST MODERATE TO HIGH NEED FOR COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY UNDERGO THE THERAPY AS PART OF THE TRAINING. ANY COMMENTS FOR MEMBERS. I'M AT SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY. AS FOR AN AUDIT OF ALL. LOCATION PROGRAMS AND SO -- AT AND I'M LISTEN TO THE LA -- ONE OF MY CONCERNS IT'S IS. AS THE DATA IS COLLECTED AND YOU GET YOUR COMPLETION RATES DO YOU COMPARE TO RECIDIVISM RATES TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE SOME MY ISSUE IS -- WE HAVE A LOT OF WHICH IT'S GOING IN AND IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO RING IN MAY TWO ROOM PROGRAM CERTAIN INNOVATIVE GRANT PROGRAMS LIBRARY SERVICES. ADULT EDUCATION CLASSES -- SECOND LANGUAGE PROGRAMS BUT HOW DOES THAT WORK. IN GETTING HIM OUT AND KEEPING THEM FROM RETURNING BACK IN. INTO INTO THE SYSTEM -- WHICH I THE LA -- IS GETTING AT HOW DO WE DO DO HAVE SYSTEMS YOU HAVE EVIDENCE BASED SYSTEMS TO SHOW THAT NOT ONLY DOES IT WORK BUT YOU GIVE ME DOLLAR NUMBERS OF WHY. WE CANNOT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS AND IT AT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS HUGE SO WE CAN INVEST MORE AND SO THAT WHEN WE LOOK DOWN IT. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION WE LOOK AT THAT IS A RETURN OF MAYBE YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED MILLION -- I'M JUST MAKING A NUMBER OF BUT YOU GET WHERE I'M GOING AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT. THE LA -- IS GETTING AT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO QUANTIFY THIS IN IT IN THE SUBURBS OF WAY AND THEY PUT. YOU YOU GET WHAT I'M BY ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK -- IF I IF I MAY WE BRIEFLY -- DISCUSSED IT AND THE HEARING EARLIER THIS WEEK BUT WE'RE SEEING SOME PEARL PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A MAJORITY OF THE RP FUNDING IS SPENT ON ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING. AND WE PULLED SOME INITIAL ONE YEAR A RECIDIVISM RATES FOR THOSE CONVICTION FOR THOSE OFFENDERS THAT HAD ACHIEVED A LEVEL OF LITERACY AS WE DEFINE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENCY. NEWS ABOUT NINE POINT 5% WE COMPARE WORK FOR ONE YOUR CONVICTIONS IT WAS EIGHTEEN POINT 3% SO THAT'S ALMOST A 50% REDUCTION NOW I SAY THAT WITH CAUTION BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE. DETAILS -- WHICH ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE SAME ALL THE LEVELS OF COMPATIBLES OF THE SAME THE PROGRAMMING THOSE TYPES OF THINGS REPRESENT ITSELF BUT OVERSEEING INITIALLY IS REALLY HIGH LEVELS OF SUCCESS BY. FOCUSING ON LITERACY AS WE DEFINE AND CONTINUING THE EDUCATION SO WE'RE HOPING IN THIS UPCOMING PLAN THAT WE PRESENTED -- YOU'LL BE ABLE TO REALLY KIND OF CLEAN THOSE DOLLAR FIGURES ON THE COST BENEFIT OF HAVING CONTINUED EDUCATION. AND I HOPE YOU'RE ABLE TO BLINK DO THAT BECAUSE WHEN THE PRIVATE PRISON PHí THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY NEEDED TEN THOUSAND MORE PRISON BEDS AND WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW COULD YOU. FIGURE THAT NUMBER OUT THEY SAID BUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY CAN'T READ AT THEIR GRADE LEVEL THEY WOULD NEED. TEN THOUSAND MORE BEDS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS SO THIS PROGRAM. IS REALLY REALLY AN IMPORTANT -- IN DEBT WE HAVE TO GET A RIDE OKAY -- WANT TO THANK YOU ALL OF THE THE PROBE. AT THE END AND I THINK WE'LL LOOK AT IT IS WITHIN THAT ONE TO A PILOT OR WHETHER WE WANT TO JUMP INTO THE PROGRAM. MOST -- MENTOR PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF LITERACY ARE RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THE RE PROGRAMS IN THE LIBRARY IS ALL ABOUT. PEOPLE BASICALLY MENTORING AND WANT TO TRAIN OTHERS TO LEARN TO READ. AND WE KNOW THAT LITERACY IS VERY FOR ISN'T -- SO WITH IT CHANGES ALL THE COGNITIVE STUFF REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT SURELY HAVING THE ABILITY TO READ. AS WELL AS THE FINISHED -- A HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY -- IS IS ONE OF THE BEST IF TO START TALK MY GETTING A JOB. WHEN YOU LEAVE PRISON IN MY NORMAL IF YOUR EMPLOYER? AND YOU HAVE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS IN THAT THAT BECOMES A DIFFERENT OPTION DIFFERENT ROLE FOR YOU IN THAT SENSE SO WE'LL LOOK AT WHAT NOT TO DO A PILOT -- NOT I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA THE MENTORSHIP PROGRAM I KNOW YOU'VE MENTIONED HERE PAYING THE FOLKS TO DO IT AND GIVING THEM AN INCENTIVE -- TO WANT TO WORK WITH THEIR PEERS AND TO ASSIST AT ONCE THEY TRAINED ON HOW TO IMPROVE -- THE LITERACY OF OF THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR COLLEAGUES AT THAT ARE THERE IN PRISON WITH THEM SO I THINK I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. I'VE SEEN IT WORK IN SCHOOLS AS WELL AS IN LIBRARIES AND EVERYWHERE ELSE WHEN YOU GET A MENTOR AND YOU GET A WELL TRAINED PERSON. REALLY MENTORS A PERSON TO LEARN TO READ A WITH THE FOCUS UPON BASICALLY DEVELOPING THAT SKILL. OF THE TO READ AND THEN OBVIOUSLY ALL THAT OTHER STUFF SHOULD KICK IN IF WE ALSO INVOLVING THEM IN SOME KIND OF OTHER TRAINING PROGRAMS. OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- THEN THE RECIDIVISM [inaudible] OKAY FOR ATTENDING THE HEARING. THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED
