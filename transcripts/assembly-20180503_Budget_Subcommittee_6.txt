AB TWENTY ONE NINETY NINE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTIFIED THE AUTHOR OF ENACTED LEGISLATION IT'S THE DEPARTMENT SUBMITS DRAFT BUDGET TRAILER. BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD SEEK TO DELAY THE EFFECTIVE DATE OR MODIFY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RECENTLY. ENACTED LEGISLATION. DURING THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET A HANDFUL OF TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SUBMISSIONS WERE IDENTIFIED AS SEEKING TO UNDO LEGISLATION THAT HAD BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR JUST THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AB THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHICH WAS MY BILL AB NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHICH WAS MY BILL AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY THREE A BAKER BILL S. B. FIVE TO FOR A LARA BILL. ALL HAD TRAILER BILL BILLS THAT ADDED LANGUAGE TO INDEFINITELY DELAY IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUE WE SHOULD AT A MINIMUM. RECEIVE NOTICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TRIES TO BUREAUCRATICALLY VETO A BILL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SIGNED INTO LAW. A WILL BE AMENDING THE BILL BEFORE IT GOES TO THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE TO SPECIFY THAT THIS APPLIES TO MEMBERS POLICY BILLS AND NOT BUDGET BILLS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AGO. THANK YOU. MISS COSTA. THOMAS PERMANENT FINANCE BUT. GOOD MORNING ANY COST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD NOT THAT THE BILL WILL HAVE SOME GENERAL FUND COST OF TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO IMPLEMENT AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN PRINTS. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT FOR ADDED TRANSPARENCY IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE AYE AND THE PAST FOR OUT OF TRANSPARENCY INCLUDING. I INCLUDING OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS ON OUR WEBSITE SO THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW WE KNOW THAT THE BILL IN FRANCE. KNOW THAT WE DID A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET THERE WERE A TOTAL OF ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED SECTIONS OF LAW THAT WERE AMENDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET ACT. WHICH WOULD CREATE. QUITE A DEAL OF AYE NOTIFICATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE CONCUR WITH THE STAFF'S SUGGESTION I'M ENSCONCED THING THAT'S RESPONSIBILITY BUT THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE. MEMBERS. WHAT ONE QUICK QUESTION FOR ME MISS COSTA SO ON THAT THE I THINK THAT KEY ISSUE THAT? ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN WAS TRYING TO REYES WAS. IN. PREVIOUS BUDGET PROPOSALS WE HAD. IT SEEMS SOMEWHAT ADHOC. PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH WERE SIGNED BUT THEN NOT FUNDED AND THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE. SORT OF ANY. SORT OF SPECIFIC REASON IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENED. HERE AND THERE I THINK. MISTER ONE REFERENCE WHEN HER BILLS SO ON DO YOU DO YOU FEEL THAT WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION THAT WE COULD STILL GET AT THAT ISSUE WITHOUT OVER BURDENING FINANCE. I'M I DO I THINK YOU KNOW I WOULD KNOW EVERY YEAR THERE'S A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR US TO PUBLISH OUR TRAILER BILLS BY FEBRUARY FIRST WHICH WE DO ON OUR WEBSITE ADDITIONALLY WE AND HAVE A SPREADSHEET THAT NOTES. WITH EACH TRAILER BILL THE AFFECTED CODE SECTIONS THAT WE SEEK TO AMEND. LOT AND SO I THINK TO GET MORE SPECIFIC. IF THAT WAS VESTED WITH IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT PARTICULAR AUTHORS WOULD HAVE AT BE NOTIFIED A AND A MORE DIRECT WAY. OKAY THANK YOU AYE IN THE ARROW ANYBODY IN SUPPORT OF. THE MEASURE. ANY OPPOSITION. HOUSE ARE WELL LET'S GO BACK TO GET ME WERE QUESTIONED IT BECAUSE IF THE AUTHOR WANTED TO. A COMMENT ABOUT THE SUGGESTION I KNOW YOU YOU YOU'RE ASKING THE PROMINENT PLANS TO DO THIS BUT. LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR THE LA ELLARD SOME ENTITY TO DO IT. RIGHT AFTER THE BUDGET COMES OUT AND AYE I REMEMBER CAN YOU BUY THIS ISSUE UP FOR GOT THE ISSUE I THINK IS AN EDUCATION RELATED THING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IT'S UP TO TWO YEARS AGO. WE FOUND OUT MONTHS LATER AND SO WITH EITHER OF THOSE TWO. US SUGGESTIONS A. YOU KNOW WORK FOR YOU I'M. I I REALLY THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE THE DEPARTMENT OF I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS MAKING A THESE DECISIONS WE HAVE TO DO. A LOT OF RESEARCH TO FIND OUT. WHICH OF BILLS HAD BEEN VETOED AND AND AS FAR AS COSTS IF IT'S JUST THESE FOUR BILLS THE COST SHOULD BE REALLY MINIMAL IT'S A. SENDING AN EMAIL TO THE AUTHOR. AND I PRESUME THERE IS. THERE ARE NOT MORE BILLS THAT ARE. VETO THIS WAY AND AGAIN I THINK THIS IS JUST FUNDAMENTAL SEPARATION OF POWER. THESE BILLS WERE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND I HAD NO IDEA THAT TWO OF MY BILLS WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED. ALL THE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. BUT WEBER JUSTIN A QUICK. COMMENTS IN A AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGE HOW THAT'S HERE. BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT. THE BUDGET IS ACTUALLY CREATED BY THE MEMBERS NOT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE NOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND SO IF THIS IS A PROBLEM IT COULD ACTUALLY I MEAN WE COULD TALK TO THE GOVERNOR AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE ABOUT SOLVING THIS PROBLEM BUT IT REALLY IS OUR PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PUT THESE THINGS IN THE BUDGET. WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE THE BUDGET AND I SOMETIMES GET CONCERNED THAT WE. HAVE TO THROW EVERYTHING A RELY HEAVILY UPON THE GOVERNOR TO GIVE US WHAT TO DO HIS BUDGET IS THE SUGGESTION. OURS IS ACTUALLY THE BUDGET. I THINK I THINK I THINK YOU FOR THAT REMINDER DOCTOR WEBER I THINK. IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE. MISS IRWIN WAS CONCERNED LAST YEAR BY THE EMISSIONS I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO. IF HER STAFF HADN'T NOTICED DE OMISSION THEN PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE GONE UNRECOGNIZED I THINK WE WERE JUST TRYING TO. AYE INSURER THAT WE DIDN'T ALL HAVE TO COMB THROUGH EVERY LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE SURE THE BILLS THAT WERE SIGNED AND COMMITTED TO. WERE ACTUALLY HOW FUNDED SO THAT I THINK THAT WAS THE ONLY THOUGHT THAT WAS IT GUY ISSUE DISPELS TRY TO RECTIFY. BUT YOU'RE OBSOLETE ONE THOUSAND. PERCENT CORRECT THAT IT IS OUR OUR BUDGET IN THAT WERE IN CHARGE OF APPROPRIATING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL. SO. THIS BILL GOES TO OUR SUSPENSE FILE HOW WE WILL BE. DISPENSING WITH THAT FILE AND OUR NEXT FULL COMMITTEE HEARING WHICH I BELIEVE IS TENTATIVELY FOR MAY FOURTEENTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY SO WE'RE WAITING FOR MISS TO DALY AND MR MATHIS. ARE YOU PRETTY FOR JOBS. AND THEN THIS IS MISTER GRAY PRESENTED MISTER DALY WAS MISTER IN THE COMING. KAMALA BECOMING. OKAY. I DO OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR. DO YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR HIM OR DO YOU WANT TO. GO. YEAH. OKAY MR DOT BUT THE PROBLEM THANK YOU MISTER ABOUT HE'S HERE TO PRESENT A CA ARE TWENTY ONE ON BEHALF MISTRESS STRUGGLED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM PROUD TO BE JOINT AUTHOR OF A CA TWENTY ONE. COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA HAS A RICH HISTORY OF INVESTMENT IT INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. WE MADE SOME AMAZING INVESTMENTS YEAH THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE STILL BENEFIT FROM TODAY. WE BUILT THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN THAT ERA WE BELTS. OUR TWENTY SIX NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES WE BUILT FIVE NEW STATE COLLEGE CAMPUSES WE BUILT TWO NEW UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES. WE BUILT OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND MILES OF STATE HIGHWAY. UNFORTUNATELY IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE GOTTEN AWAY FROM THAT RICH TRADITION. BOB BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE WE INVESTED TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF STATE REVENUE. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT'S ONLY BEEN BETWEEN ONE AND THREE PERCENT. SO THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THAT THEY SEE TWENTY ONE WOULD CREATE A NEW AMENDMENT TO THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE ALLOCATION OF A MINIMUM OF TWO PERCENT OF STATE REVENUE. TO THE BUILDING OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD BE DIVIDED UP. INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR EXPANSION OF THE STATE ROADWAYS. AND FIFTY PERCENT WOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR A. ALLOCATION TO INNOVATIVE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS LIKE THE KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE BUILT BACK IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND NINETEEN FIFTIES. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WOULD DRIVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY OF TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE A INNOVATIVE. WATER STORAGE OF TALKING ABOUT A WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY THINGS LIKE A ROADWAYS THAT AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS THEY WERE DRIVING THESE ARE THE KINDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA A LEAD THE NATION AGAIN. IN INFRASTRUCTURE INSTEAD OF TRAILING THE NOTION AS WE ARE NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT. I OUR FAILURE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE HAS DONE. BY IT IS STARKLY APPARENT WE HAD A RESEARCH FIRM LAST YEAR RANK US AS THE WORST TRAFFIC IN THE COUNTRY CERTAINLY WHERE LAWYERS Y. LOS TEN PERCENT IN TERMS OF OUR PAVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE ARE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BADLY NEEDED AND WE CAN DO IT IN SUCH WAY THAT PAVES THE WAY FOR SUCCESS FOR THE STATEMENT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. A BECAUSE TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO FILE ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU COMING BACK TO THE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE. DYESS. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OUT MY MILEY ARE. CALM THAT WAS VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT YOU MISTER MAYES BRING THIS WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. TO HAVE A ROBUST DISCUSSION ON HOW MUCH WE ARE INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND YOU ARE CORRECT THAT WE ARE. ON. OR BEHIND FROM WHERE WE USED TO BE AND I THINK IT IS A VERY MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION TO HAVE ON FIGURING OUT HOW HOW MUCH OF THAT THE BUDGET SHOULD BE SPENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE. OUT WITH THAT ANY. ANY PEOPLE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BOB READ WITH READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. IT'S DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE IN LONG. LONG RANGE PLANNING FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS WITHOUT A STABLE AND PREDICTABLE. SOURCE OF REVENUES IN THE GENERAL FUND DOES PROVIDE THAT. A I ALSO POINT OUT TO THE MEMBERS OF THAT WHEN WE RELY ON ISSUE IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS KIND OF A FEAST OR FAMINE TYPE OF APPROACH. BUT IT ENDS UP HAVING TWICE THE IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND COMPARED TO PAY GO BECAUSE THAT. THE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON IT SO. WE THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THE STATE TO GET ON A STEADY DIET OF GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE REQUEST A. GROUP PAYROLL CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IVAN ALL TOMORROW HERE ON BEHALF OF GLOBAL AUTOMAKERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO COMMENT ON THIS. AC TWENTY ONE THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE AND MISTER MAYES. I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION PORTION OF OF OF THE BILL. WE ARE WITNESSING THE TRANSFORMATION OF TRANSPORTATION BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. HOW CONSUMERS GET GET PRODUCTS FROM A POINT A TO POINT B. IS CHANGING RAPIDLY BUT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY STILL EXPERIENCING SOME THE SAME OLD PROBLEMS THAT? ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE REFERRED TO REGARDING. HOW BAD ARE TRAFFIC IS A CONGESTION IS IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? AT THE SAME TIME THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IS EVOLVING FROM HARDWARE TO A SOFTWARE BASED BUSINESS MODEL. THIS MEANS THAT THE FUTURE OF MOBILITY AND THE NEEDS AND DEMANDS WILL INCREASINGLY BE ELECTRIFIED AUTOMATED AND CONNECTED. TODAY THERE'S OVER FORTY ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE OFFERED IN CALIFORNIA. AYE AND AUTOMAKERS ARE ANNOUNCING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PLANS TO OFFER MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THE COMING YEARS. INFRASTRUCTURE HAS PROVEN TO BE A MAJOR IMPORTANT FACTOR. IN HELPING CONSUMERS ADOPT AND HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THIS NEW TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. WE WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. BACK IN JANUARY WHERE HE GETS COMMITTED TO INCREASING FUNDING FOR BOTH ELECT CHARGING STATIONS AND ADDITIONAL HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. AND CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF OF GETTING THOSE THINGS BILL. UP CALIFORNIA MUST RECOGNIZE IN MOVING FORWARD IT'S TRANSPORTATION THAT. WE NEED A NETWORK THAT WILL SERVE HIGHLY AUTOMATED SLIGHTLY AUTOMATED IN ON AUTOMATED VEHICLES AT THE SAME TIME. WORD THAT'S IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE FOR IN YEARS TO COME CONNECTED WITH THE THROUGH VEHICLE TO VEHICLE AND VEHICLE TO INFRASTRUCTURE. IS GOING TO BE THE FOUNDATION FOR IMPROVING VEHICLE SAFETY AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION. IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE TRANSPORTATION WILL BE VASTLY SAFER CLEANER AND QUICKER. BUT THAT FUTURE PRESENTS US WITH A NEW SET OF INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES ONLY SIX PERCENT OF U. S. CITIES. CURRENTLY HAVE A TRANSPORTATION PLAN. IN PLACE TO ADDRESS AUTOMATED AND CONNECTED TO VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY. THERE WILL OF COURSE ALWAYS BE A NEED FOR. BRIDGES ROADS RAILWAYS WATERWAYS AIRPORTS THAT A BIT SKEWED BE BUILT CONCRETE STEEL ASPHALT. BUT THE SAME TIME SMART CITIES NEED SMARTER NEED SMART SOLUTIONS AND SO WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DO. TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST MOST FAVORABLE AUTOMATED VEHICLE OPERABILITY CALIFORNIA MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ANALYZE AND MAKE BEST USE OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS DATA TO IMPROVE THE DESIGN. AND THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC WITH TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS FOR BOTH AUTOMATED AND AUTONOMY VEHICLES. AS THE STATE CONSIDERS ONGOING AND FUTURE PUBLIC INVESTMENT WE RECOMMEND THE PAUL THAT POLICY MAKERS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES. SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF SMART INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS A PROMOTION A FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES. ESTABLISH GRANT PROGRAMS TO EXPAND SMART COMMUNITIES AND CONNECTED QUARTER DEPLOYMENTS INCREASE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE INCENTIVES AND ELECTRIC CHARGING AND HYDROGEN. REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE TREATING INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION NETWORK WHERE URBAN MOBILITY FREEWAYS HIGHWAYS COMMUTER RAILS TRAINS AND AIRPORTS WORK SEAMLESSLY TOGETHER. AT TO COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER. WE NEED TO SUPPORT DODD MORE DEPLOYMENT OF VEHICLE TO VEHICLE AND VEHICLE TO INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY AND HELP ENSURE THAT THE FIVE POINT NINE GIGAHERTZ SAFETY SPECTRUM. REMAINS AVAILABLE FOR AVAILABLE FOR SUCH PURPOSES. WE NEED TO STREAMLINED THE CONSTRUCTION BIDDING AND PERMITTING PROCESS TO ENCOURAGE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT TO XLR EIGHT THE DEPLOYMENT OF VEHICLE TO VEHICLE VEHICLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT STANDARDIZATION A UNIFORMITY OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES SUCH AS LAME MARKING SIGNAGE SIGNALS TRAFFIC BARRIERS MARKINGS AND EMERGENCY PULL OFF. AREAS. UNTIL RECENTLY AUTOMOBILES DID NOT HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE ROADWAYS IF YOU'RE PLEASE WRAP UP I AM WRAPPING UP RIGHT NOW. DRIVERS DID ALL THE WORK. SO TODAY WE'RE INCREASINGLY. WAR IN THE FUTURE IT TODAY AND IN FUTURE CARS AND TRUCKS ARE GONNA BE READING IN PERCEIVING THE ROADWAYS AND SO WE NEED TO KEEP THESE PRINCIPLES IN MIND. AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ISRAEL SOLACE WITH A SEPARATE UTILITIES. WE DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION AT IT ON A CA WILL I TWENTY ONE BUT WE DID ONE OFFER SOME COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE LANGUAGE RELATED TO ELECTRICAL GRID INFRASTRUCTURE. ON EVERY YEAR AS YOU KNOW WE MAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN PARTICULAR THE ELECTRICAL GRID. I'M AS WE FACE THE NEW REALITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WILDFIRES WE'RE LOOKING INCREASINGLY AT AT TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS MICROGRAMS. AS A MEASURE TO MITIGATE AND ENSURE RELIABLE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND A QUICK BY WAY OF EXAMPLE WE'VE PARTNERED WITH THE COMMUNITY WE WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY OF PREGO SPRINGS IN THE NORTHEAST PART OF ART OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. WHICH IS A REMOTE PART OF THE AREA THAT'S HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ONE SUB TRANSMISSION LINE I'M AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE'VE UTILIZED THAT MICHAEL GRIFFIN LEASE FOUR TIMES TO. TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON UTILIZING SOLAR BATTERY AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY SO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF OF THE ELECTRICAL GRID LANGUAGE AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE FROM THE REMAINING IS BECAUSE IF YOU COULD PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF I'M GIVING EVERYONE LATITUDE SINCE ITS BUDGET COMMITTEE BUT. CERTAINLY MR PARA MEMBERS TRANSMIT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL ON. DISCUSSION ON HOW TO. INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY GENERATING NEW WATER SUPPLIES NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES AND THEN TRANSMITTING. THOSE SUPPLIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS SO WE LOOK FORWARD OF THE ONGOING DISCUSSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VALERIE TRAIL OF LAJOS PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND WE TO DO NOT HAVE A FORMER POSITION BUT ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY THINK THE AUTHOR IN HIS JOINT AUTHORS. FOR BRINGING THE DISCUSSION FORWARD IN LIGHT OF THE. CLIMATE DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING WE THINK THAT THIS IS A HEALTHY CONVERSATION TO DISCUSS OUR RESILIENCY PGD HAS INVESTED OVER THE LAST. OF FIVE YEARS FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO HARDEN OUR ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND WOULD LIKE ON TO WE THINK THIS IS A HEALTHY DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE FORWARD THINK YOU. THANK YOU BYE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS A ADAM SMITH'S OF THE CALIFORNIA EDISON WHILE WE ALSO DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION WE DO WANNA COMMEND THE OFFICE FOR TAKING UP THE. THE QUESTION OF HOW WE NEED TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE TO RISE TO A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES CLIMATE CHANGE. INCREASING ELECTRIFICATION OF TRANSPORTATION. INCREASING. DEVELOPMENT IN OUR CITIES AND SO. WE THINK THE OTHERS AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WORKING WITH THEM. THANK YOU. COURTESY IN A LINE'S VITAL BILL MANUFACTURES AND HONOR THE CHAIRS WHICH I WILL AS THE LINE MY COMMENT. I ALIGN. WITH THE COMMENTS THAT TO. A MISTER ALTAMURA REPS IN THE GLOBAL LAWMAKERS MAKE BUT I'LL. ADD TO THESE IT IF THE PROMISE OF BOTH. ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR TRANSPORTATION AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE TO HAPPEN WE DO NEED IN INFRASTRUCTURE A PORTION OF THIS AND THE OTHER PART ESPECIALLY WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TECHNOLOGY. WE CAN'T FORGET OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS THEY HAVE A HUGE ROLE IN IN DEVELOPING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN MAKING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WORK SAFELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER CLUB MEMBERS AYE THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT. SEEING THAT ANYONE OPPOSITION. COMPORT. OKAY COMING BACK TO THE DYESS ANY. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE. OKAY AT THIS POINT IN THE OF THE. MEASURE GOES DISPENSED PILE WILL BE DISPENSING THAT THAT ON THE MAY FOURTEENTH HEARING NOTHING TO SHARE IF I COULD JUST HAVE A MINUTE TO CLOSE I APOLOGIZE PLEASE CLOSE THANK YOU. YOU KNOW IF YOU ASK THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN WHAT THEIR VIEW OF THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT IS HIGH UP ON THE LIST WOULD BE. THE PROVISION OF COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE. AND YET WE DON'T BUILD ANYMORE. HERE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. THE STATISTIC I WAS QUOTING BEFORE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE WE INVESTED TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF STATE REVENUES IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE AVERAGE HAS BEEN BETWEEN ONE AND THREE PERCENT AND YET. IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME THE STATE'S POPULATION HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. OUR GROSS STATE DOMESTIC PRODUCT HAS MORE THAN TRIPLED. WE ENJOYED THE BENEFITS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT OUR PARENTS INVESTED IN. BACK IN THAT TIME PERIOD WHEN THE STATE WAS SPENDING THAT MONEY AND OUR CHILDREN WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TO ENJOY THOSE BENEFITS UNLESS WE ARE WILLING TO MAKE THAT SAME INVESTMENTS SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO SUPPORT THIS BILL OR AT LEAST A SUPPORT CONTINUING THEY CONVERSATION ON THIS WHEN. THE APPROPRIATE TIME COMES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. I WITH THAT WE HAVE. MISTER DALY AND A. B. SEVENTEEN FORTY. STURDILY I BELIEVE OTHER. OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS YES SIR. MISSOURI ONE AND MR GRAY OR. ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS REQUEST. OF THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU IS AB SEVENTEEN FORTY. SIX TO CREATE A NEW MORE FLEXIBLE STATE SAVINGS ACCOUNT TO WHETHER THE STATE'S BOOM AND BUST REVENUE CYCLE AND INSULATE CALIFORNIANS FROM THE CUTS MADE DURING RECESSIONS. THIS BILL WILL ESTABLISH THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT. IN ACCOUNT THAT WOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE STATE'S EXISTING RAINY DAY FUND. AS YOU ALL KNOW IN TWENTY FOURTEEN VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROP TWO. WHICH STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S EXISTING BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE STATE CAN SAVE WHEN WE ARE IN THE GREEN. IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FULLY FUNDING. THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT TO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CAP OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION. MY CO AUTHORS AND I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LAUDABLE GOAL TO SAVE WHILE TIMES ARE GOOD. HOWEVER AS THE LA O. RECENTLY POINTED OUT FEELING THAT ACCOUNT TO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY. COUNTER INTUITIVELY MAKES PREPARING FOR RECESSION MORE DIFFICULT IN FUTURE YEARS. CURRENT BUDGET SAVINGS ACCOUNT EVEN FULLY FUNDED BY THE GOVERNOR IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED FOR A MILD RECESSION. THE LA O. BELIEVES OF THE STATE WILL ACTUALLY NEED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS TO BATTLE A MILD RECESSION OR FORTY BILLION IN SAVINGS TO BATTLE. EVEN A MODERATE RECESSION. THE BILL BEFORE YOU AS A LONG TERM REFORM THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENTLY GENERATIONS ARE NOT SADDLED WITH OUR DEBT OR FORCED TO MAKE SEVERE CUTS TO EDUCATION. AND OTHER IMPORTANT PROGRAMS WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD WE SAVE. SO THAT WHEN TIMES ARE BAD WOMEN FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A GOOD EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OFFERING HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO OUR SENIORS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION COMING OFFICES. SPENCE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. THANK MISTER. MR GRAMM A SORT PUMP MISS COST. WHAT WHAT WE GOT MEMBERS FIRST LITTLE BUTTONS COST THAT OCCUR? THEY YOU ARE MATURE MEMBERS JUST BY A PROPOSAL. WHICH I AM A JOINT AUTHOR OF. IS A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT CAUCUS. THE CONCEPT BUILDS ON. SUGGESTIONS PUT FORTH BY LEGISLATE MASS OFFICE AND THE SPIRIT OF IT FRANKLY IS TO CREATE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY. UP CALIFORNIA SUFFERED FOR FAR TOO LONG BOOM AND BUST CYCLES. IN MANY CASES OUR HANDS ARE TIED BY. THE CURRENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THAT DO EXIST WITHIN THE STATE BUDGET. DO HAVE LIMITATIONS AND THIS ALLOWS US TO. GET AROUND SOME OF THOSE LIMITATIONS TO SAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IF WE ARE TO HEAR MILD RECESSION A FULLY FUNDED. A RAINY DAY FUND WILL NOT COVER THE COST OF EVEN A MILD RECESSION WE ALL KNOW THAT. OUT CERTAINLY THE MEMBERS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE KNOW THAT I IT'S CONSISTENT WITH. AS I SAID THE SUGGESTION WAS THAT MARRIAGE OFFICE AND E APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION BOTH THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU AND ALSO A. INCLUSION AYE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. THE KIT MISTER. THIS IS JUST A FISCALLY PRUDENT MOVING AS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THIS YEAR WHEN THERE'S A SUCH AN ACCESS IN THE BUDGET I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY WARY THAT WE DON'T TAKE ON TOO MANY OF ONGOING EXPENSES AND WE SHOULD REALLY BE LOOKING AT. OF THE ONE TIME EXPENSES OR MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION WE'RE IN THIS YEAR. AND. AND FUND THIS RESERVE ACCOUNT. THANK YOU. THIS COST. IN ACOSTA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE ESTIMATE THAT. THE PROVISIONS OF AB SEVENTEEN FORTY LIKELY WOULD DECREASE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM SPENDING ON ME AND. NOT ST HIGHWAY OUT PROJECTS BY ABOUT THE BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR STARTING IN NINETEEN TWENTY BASED UPON OUR PROJECTIONS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY. AND I THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OPPOSES THIS BILL ALTHOUGH WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE INTENT OF BUILDING UP A MORE ROBUST RESERVE TO WHETHER RECESSION. WE DOUBT THAT IT APPEARS TO CIRCUMVENT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS OF OUR PROPOSITION TWO WHICH REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEYOND THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT GO TOWARDS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PLANTS. MR PICKED COOPER RECKONED AT THE AUTHOR ADDRESS THAT MR MCCARTY. YEAH I I SEE IT COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY A HARM TO ME IT'S BIZARRE TO HAVE A RESERVE FUND THAT IS CAPPED. WHY NOT HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE BUDGET PROCESS? AND I THINK ARM. SO THAT'S MY RESPONSE TO THAT IS ARM. THE CREATION THAT THAT THE MAYOR CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL RESERVE ACCOUNT. SHOULD NOT BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AS LONG AS WE ARE FULFILLING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES TO FILL THE SECOND RESERVE WHICH IS THE RAINY DAY FUND THIS IS EFFECTIVELY. THE REASON YOU NEED A THIRD RESERVE ACCOUNT. IS. THE EXACT. FOR THAT REASON. THE SECOND RESERVE ACCOUNT HAS LIMIT HAS LIMITATIONS. IT HAS LIMITATIONS WHY WOULD WE WHY WOULD WE PUT OURSELVES IN A POSITION OF HAVING A FALSE CHOICE. IF WE WANT TO PUT MORE MONEY IN RESERVES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO. I DON'T THINK REVIEW BRING THIS FORWARD OBVIOUSLY A BUDGETS THEY THE COUNT AS IMPORTANT AS WE KNOW FROM THE LAST DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. SOME STATE PROGRAMS ARE NEVER FULLY RESTORED. STILL SUFFER TODAY THAT'S WITH THE BIG ISSUE. YEAH IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN. IF WE CAN LESSEN THAT IMPACT. I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE DO SOMETHING HERE SITE A VERY SUPPORTIVE BIGGEST THING ALSO CO AUTHOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISS MCCARTY. YEAH MISTER ABOUT. I WANTED TO APPLAUD THE PRESENTATION I DO HAVE A TECHNICAL QUESTION JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SEVENTEEN FORTY AND IT BEING CHAPTER. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION IS THE CAN YOU HELP US TO EXPLAIN. HOW THAT WOULD WORK AND? WHAT HOW THAT WILL PROCEED? GO AHEAD. AS. STATE REQUEST WHICH SURVEYS NOTED NOW SAYS ON PAGE TWO. YOU MAY NOT IN IN THE FINAL PARAGRAPH THE AUTHORS OFFICE STATES POPE IS THE NEW FUND WOULD PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PLAN. SINCE THAT COULD NOT OCCUR BEFORE THIS BILL IS CHAPTER THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH REFER THIS TO SUB FOR FOR CONSIDERATION THE BUDGET PACKAGE I THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH. THE JOINT AUTHORS OF THE PROPOSAL. WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY. BUT AS FAR AS THE FINAL OUTCOME I DON'T IF THE BILL WAS THE FOCUS OF THE AFTERBURNER THE ENTIRE BUDGET PROCESS. I'M. HEARING WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS STATED THOUGH I THINK WE MAY WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE MIDDLE GROUND BECAUSE. YOUR END GOAL IS LAUDABLE AND SUPPORT. BUT HOW WE. MAKE SURE THAT THE DETAILS ARE APPROPRIATE HIS IMPORTANT AS WELL SO. I'M JUST ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO TRY AND WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN GET TO THE MIDDLE. MR CHAIRMAN I HAVE A FOLLOW UP COMMENT PLEASE OF THE I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT MISTER DALY'S COMES I THINK FOR THE PART OF FINANCE TO. SUGGEST THAT WE CAN ONLY INVEST MENTOR STRUCTURE MORE WE FULLY FUND THE RAINY DAY FUND THIS WOULD SOMEHOW DETRACT FROM MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE. AYE IS IS ABSOLUTELY ARE A RED HERRING IN A FALSE CHOICE. WE AS A BODY CAN MAKE THE DECISIONS TO USE WHATEVER FUNDS WE INTEND TO SPEND ON INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. RESTRICTIONS ON OUR SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THAT DON'T MEET EVEN THE MILD RECESSION PROJECTIONS OF THE ALEJO SUGGEST THAT SOMEBODY POORLY DRAFTED. SOME OF THOSE. PREVIOUS EFFORTS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THIS ALLOWS US THAT FLEXIBILITY. WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL AN END RUN AROUND I WOULD CALL AN IMPROVEMENT TO? I PROPOSE A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL. I AGREE COMPLETELY. I THINK IT'S QUESTION TO BOTH. MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS MISS COSTA. ON AT DID YOU ALSO LOOK AT POTENTIALLY JUST EXPANDING THEIR OF THE REGULAR RESERVE COUNT I KNOW THAT. ON THE RECORD YOUR ACCOUNT HAS HAS SOME OF AN ARTIFICIAL CAP THAT WHEN YOU HIT THAT FOUR PERCENT THAT WE HAVE TO GO LOWERED THE BAR. SALES TAX ON DECIDING YOU IT WE HAVE A SET OF NOT TO HIT THAT FOUR PERCENT. BUT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT DOWN. MISS COSTA YOU WOULD FIND MORE FAVORABLE OR MIGHT BE BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THAT WOULD BE. BUT IN THAT WOULD SO THAT WAS SORT OF EASIER TO DO. I'M GONNA ATTEMPT NOT TO GET TOO TECHNICAL WE START TALKING ABOUT RESERVES AND THE IRONY IS NOT LOST ON ME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING A THIRD RESERVE FUND. SAID THE FIRST RESERVE FUND PROPS MOST FLEXIBLE OF THE LA AS RECENT REPORT LAYS OUT IS THE ASSET FEWER THE STATE FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY A LOT OF PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT KIND OF THE BALLOTS OF YOUR CHECKBOOK. IT'S WHAT WE UTILIZE WHEN THERE'S AN EMERGENCY AS THERE WAS RECENTLY IN BOTH THAT YOU KNOW THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE AS WELL AS THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE WITH THE WILDFIRES. BSA AS WAS ON TESTIFIED AND I WERE PROPOSING I'M ACTUALLY GOING BEYOND WHAT'S REQUIRED AND DEPOSITED THE PSA IN THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSED BUDGET TO BRING IT UP TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF TEN PERCENT. THATTEN PERCENT NUMBER IS A ROLLING NUMBER THAT'S RECALCULATED AT EVERY YEAR THAT WE I'M I JUST THE BUDGET REVENUES TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HITTING THE TEN PERCENT BECAUSE REVENUES OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT STATIC. THAT SAID I THINK THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT. SEEM TO BE COMING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ARE TWO FOLD IF THERE IS A RECESSION. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO HAVE ON HAND? AS HAS BEEN TESTIFIED ON ELLIOT HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT RECESSION SCENARIOS WE DO AS WELL. I WOULD NOTE THAT IN A RECESSION SCENARIO IS LIKELY GOING TO HAPPEN OVER MULTIPLE BUDGET CYCLES SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO BUILD UP A HEALTHY RESERVE OF FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. IT BUYS YOU TIME. IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT A RECESSION OF THAT SCALE AND SCOPE WOULD CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR ON AND THAT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE UNDERPINNINGS OF PROPOSITION TWO. WAS TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME A LITTLE BIT OF AN ABILITY TO FUND THINGS. ON WHAT THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES WERE DEALT WITH PREVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. ON TO YOUR POINT. THERE ARE TWO. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTIONS THAT LIMIT THE TOTAL AMOUNT IN THAT AS AT THE YEAR BEFORE YOU TRIGGER A SALES TAX. OUGHT REDUCTION A ONE OF THOSE CALCULATIONS I IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THAT A DIRECTOR OF FINANCE SO IN ESSENCE. BOTH OF THE EXISTING RESERVES DO YOU HAVE. CAP OF SOME SORT. THANK YOU. MISTER. I THINK THE LA OWES DONE EXCELLENT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT AND. THIS IDEA WE. WHEN WE WHEN IT DAWNED ON US THAT THERE ARE CAPS ON THE EXISTING RESERVE ACCOUNTS. WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL MEANWHILE THE LA. INDEPENDENTLY REACHED A SIMILAR CONCLUSION SO I THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN FINANCE IN THE LA SHOW. IN THIS SUBJECT BEARS MORE DISCUSSION MY LOVE GOAL AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE SHOULD WE JUST WANT TO HAVE. BOB ALL THE CHOICES ON THE TABLE WE DON'T WANT FALSE CHOICES. THANK YOU. I DON'T WANT. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT THE CONVERSATION AND OBVIOUSLY WE NEED MUCH MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT. OF VARIOUS RESERVE ACCOUNTS AND WHETHER AND HOW HOW MUCH DO WE ACTUALLY NEED AND. A BECAUSE I CAN SEE US GETTING THIS WITH AND THEN SOMEBODY COME ALONG AND SAY WE NEED ANOTHER ONE AND WE NEED ANOTHER ONE. ANOTHER ONE AND WHAT GENERALLY HAPPENS IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THE ACT. IN THAT CONVERSATION WE FAIL TO ALSO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT. IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THIS AS YOU POINTED OUT WE STILL HAVE NOT FUNDED A AWFUL LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND. AND SO WE WE KEEP SAVING AND SAVING AND SAVING AND WE NEVER TAKE DEAL WITH THE FOLKS WHO STRUGGLING A LITTLE SECURITY WILL GET WHO CAN'T LIVE EVERY. DAY BECAUSE I GETTING SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN RENT IS HIDE THEY CAN'T YOU KNOW WE GOT HEALTHCARE ISSUE SO WE GOT A LOT OF ISSUES. WERE BEING ASKED TO DELIVER INFRASTRUCTURE AND UPDATED THAT SOUNDS REALLY EXCITING BUT IF WE KEEP. A SAVING AND SAVING INSIDE THE AND I'M NOT OPPOSE THE SAME BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE FRIENDS WHO SAY EVEN THOUGH LEAH. AND ALL AND THEY HAVE HUGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT WHEN THEY DIED OH FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO ENJOY SO I THINK AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO FIND WHAT IS REASONABLE AS A AS A AS A HOUSE TO. IN TERMS OF A SAVINGS MOST FOLKS LOOK AT TEN TWENTY TEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF WHATEVER BUT I DON'T WANT US TO GET SO CAUGHT UP IN THIS ALL THE TIME IT AND ALL CONVERSATIONS. THAT WE'D LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S STILL AN AWFUL LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED. YOU KNOW WE'RE EMBARRASSED THAT OUR SCHOOLS AT FORTY SOME PERCENT. YOU KNOW. IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T FUND OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE SEE ISSUES I UC'S OF YOU KNOW WE DON'T FIND THEM AT THE LEVEL THAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE FUNDED. AND SO WE'RE NOT INVESTING IN MOST THINGS AND WHAT INVESTING HONEST IT WE WANTED IN THIS CONVERSATION IS COST INVEST IN SAVINGS WERE. IF WE INVESTED IN PEOPLE OF THE REVENUE WOULD COME AND THEREFORE YOU'D END UP WITH THE MUCH MORE A DIFFERENT KIND OF ROBUST CONVERSATION WE ALSO HAVE NEVER DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF TAXES IN THE STATE AND WHAT PROP THIRTEEN DID TO US. AND CREATED THIS INSTABILITY NOBODY WANTS TO DEAL WITH THAT SO WE THINK WE CAN SAVE OUR WAY OUT OF IT WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF OUR TAX BASE. SO I MEAN THERE A LOT OF HARD ISSUES THAT OTHER STATES HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. SAVINGS. IS FINE BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GET US TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND THEN IT WAS SAVING THINKING THIS GOING TO BE RECESSION IS GOING TO BE RECESSION IN. AND OUT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL WISE ABOUT THAT BUT I DON'T. I I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO THE CONSULATE AND THE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WHEN I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES ON ALL OF OUR BUDGETS THAT WE HAVE NOT FUNDED. AND AND HAVE DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO EVEN THINK ABOUT FUNDING AND A AND SO WE HEAR ABOUT THAT THE POVERTY RATE THE CHILD CARE THE PRESCHOOLS. FOR ALL THE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYBODY YOU KNOW WE'VE OF THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE AND UP. AND UP AND. THIS I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HELPS US I DON'T THINK IT DOES BUT A I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WHAT IS REASONABLE TO DEAL WITH SAVINGS. BUT I GET SO CAUGHT UP IN IT THAT WE IN THE SAVING OUR WAY IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE FAIL TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUES WE HAVE TO FILL DEAL WITH EVERYDAY. THE CONDUCTOR OF THE SCRIPT IN SHERMAN I IF I COULD JUST RESPOND. TWO DUTCH WORDS COMMENTS AND FRANKLY I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT. SHE HAD TO SAY THEIR. MOST NOTABLY A TOWARDS THE END OF HER A QUESTION THIS DISCUSSION OF TAX REFORM. RIGHT BECAUSE AT THE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THIS STATE HAS NOT DONE ANY SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM. A IN A VERY LONG TIME WE CONTINUE TO HAVE BOOM AND BUST BUDGETS BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A STABLE REVENUE SOURCE OVER MULTIPLE BUDGET YEARS. AND I AND I WOULD JOIN. MISS WEBER IN AND SUGGESTING WE SHOULD ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR UP UNTIL THAT TIME IN WHICH WE GET SOME TAX REFORM FOR MORE STABLE REVENUES IT IS IRRATIONAL. IMMATURE AND IRRESPONSIBLE NOT TO HAVE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WE CAN A. BAD FOR INCREASED THOSE VERY PROGRAMS THAT MISS WEBER JUST OUTLINED JUST TO CUT THEM TO A THREE YEARS DOWN THE LINE. THAT'S NOT GOOD PRACTICE IT'S NOT GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND SO I WOULD GUESS I WOULD LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU MEMBERS AS. A MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY FOR THIS BODY FOR THE LEGISLATURE UP UNTIL THE POINT ON THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE SOME KIND OF TAX REFORM TO CREATE A MORE STABLE. A REVENUE SOURCE SOURCE OVER ABOUT YEARS. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I AM GENERALLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD BE SETTING ASIDE MORE OF OUR MONEY. WHEN TIMES ARE ECONOMICALLY GOOD RELATIVELY SPEAKING AND THAT WILL ALLOW US. TO SPEND MORE WHEN TIMES ARE ECONOMICALLY BAD AND HELP OUT THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE GREATER DEMAND FOR SOCIAL SERVICES WHEN. WHEN ARE WE GET WE SLIP INTO RECESSION SO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT HOWEVER I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE SFU. HAS A CAP HAVE BEEN IT'S CLEAR THAT THE BSA HAS A CAP THE SFE YOU JUST HAS A LIMIT BEYOND WHICH WERE WE TO CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO IT. WE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO LOWER THE STATE SALES TAX RATE SO I THINK THAT ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT CREATING THE THIRD RESERVE ACCOUNT. PASSED TO INCLUDE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO JUST CONTINUE FUNDING THE SFE YOU. ARE AND ACCEPT THE FACT THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL BUDGET SURPLUS SO IT'S APPROPRIATE TO LOWER THE SALES TAX RATE CALIFORNIA. THANK. MISS MCCARTY. YEAH I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE. WHETHER IT'S FLEXIBILITY OR ITS. IT'S INSUFFICIENT THE NUMBER I KNOW THAT THAT MISTER DALY UNITE TALK LAST FEARS ABOUT A RESERVE IN ONE THE FIRST QUESTIONS YOU ASKED WE DO A PRESENTATION IN OUR CAUCUSES. WHERE WE AT WITH CLOSE TO THAT THAT TEN PERCENT MARKER? AND DOWN AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS IS THERE AND NOT FLEXIBILITY NOT BUT IS THAT INSUFFICIENT AND I THINK YOUR ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE MAKING IS THE TO RESERVE ACCOUNTS. COMBINED ARE INSUFFICIENT AND. AND I DO KNOW THAT THE THE BILL WE HEARD BEFORE HERE IS INVESTING MORE IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALL THE LETTERS WE GET. YOU ARE SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS THERE ARE TRADE OFFS AND SO BUT MY MIND A RESERVE LESS MONEY FOR ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE WANTED TO FOCUS. IS IS IS THAT IS THAT AS THE OVER ARCHING PREMISE FLEXIBILITY OR THAT. WE THINK THAT TEN PERCENT IS INADEQUATE IT I WOULD SAY IT'S BOTH. I THINK. CURRENT STRUCTURE. I MEAN I LIKE THE RAINY DAY FUND IT'S REAL POPULAR AROUND THE STATE I THINK IT WAS A GREAT IDEA. IRONICALLY. IT'S. IT IS LIMITED. SO THAT WHEN IT'S MAXED OUT. YOU SPEND THE OVERAGE ON INFRASTRUCTURE MEANWHILE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET WE SPEND MONEY ON INFRASTRUCTURE I ALSO LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I LIKE TOFUND THE PROGRAMS THE MISS WEBER MENTIONED IT JUST IT CREATES A FALSE CHOICE FOR US IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IN A YEAR LIKE THIS WHEN WE HAVE. SURPLUS REVENUES. WHY SHOULD WE BE ABLE TO SPEND THE SURPLUS? AS WE WOULD LIKE WERE AS WE WOULD SUGGEST. WITHOUT A. WHAT IS A FALSE CHOICE IN THE STRUCTURAL IN THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE BUT IT BUT IT DOES GET TO THE ISSUE THAT? SOME WOULD SAY THAT IF WE HAVE INCREASE REVENUE. THAT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T. A HIGHER MORE FACULTY AT SURE HER CITY OR CSU YOU SHOULD DO THINGS BY AT ONE TIME WHICH GOES BACK TO THAT KIND ISSUE BEFORE. BE VESTED IN AND HOUSING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE YOUR TRANSPORTATION WHAT HAVE YOU ITSELF. NO THAT'S HELP THAT'S A A ONE TIME NOT I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT SKYNET THAT. THAT I PERSPECTIVE THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LAYS OUT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT THIS SILLY BEING IRRESPONSIBLE AND DOING ONGOING EXPENDITURES BUT USING. THAT AS FOR FOR ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE PURPOSE WE DON'T HAVE. A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH WE CAN SPEND ON SOCIAL SERVICES OR EDUCATION OR INFRASTRUCTURE THERE ARE NO LIMITS. IN OUR BUDGET PROCESS THERE'S A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH WE CAN PUT INTO RESERVES TODAY UNLESS THE LA WHAT'S WRONG. THERE IS A LIMIT AND AND WHY WOULD WE DO THAT TO OURSELVES. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THE PUTTING MONEY INTO RESERVES IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SPENDING ON SOCIAL SERVICES OR EDUCATION OR ANY OTHER PROGRAMS I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT. THIS IS MORE OF A TECHNICAL PROPOSAL. BY THE WAY THE PROPOSAL REALLY BEFORE US IS NOT. IS JUST A. CREATE THAT ACCOUNT. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT ARM AND THEN IT'S UP TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE HOW TO SPEND. THE SURPLUS. BUT TO ME IT'S BIZARRE WHEN WE'RE TOLD RIGHT UP FRONT OH YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T PUT ANY MORE MONEY IN RESERVES IS OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE OFTHE STRUCTURE OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS. TO ME THAT'S A FALSE CHOICE TO SHARE. AND THEN ALSO DURING A RECESSION WOULD PROGRAM FOR CUT. WHAT PROGRAMS WERE CUT SOCIAL PROGRAMS? THAT'S STILL NOT RECOVERED WHO GOT IT FIRST. WHAT'S ALSO ON MY MIND EXCUSE ME IS WHEN WE CAME IN. OUR CLASS BECAME MEN AND. DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWELVE. OUR PREDECESSORS HAD EXPERIENCED A BRUTAL. SERIES OF BUDGET CUTS AND I TOLD MYSELF I DON'T WANT TO EVER DO I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT IT'S WRONG. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS IT'S WRONG FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE TO. CUT PROGRAMS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE SO WE SHOULD SAVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ON MY LIKE THE RAINY DAY FUND I JUST I I THINK WE NEED TO GO A STEP BEYOND THAT SIMPLY TO GIVE OURSELVES THE FLEXIBILITY. YEAH BIGGEST MIGHT I ADD TO THAT DOWN. I CERTAINLY. AGREE WITH A SPEAR MR MCCARTY COMMENTS IN THE SENSE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ABOUT FOR. THOSE CAPS GET INVESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER CURRENT LAW. BOB I WOULD ECHO. MISSION DAILIES COMMENTS AND ALL THIS DOES IS PROVIDERS THAT ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW. I AND I THINK BOTH OF US HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOR HAVE A FRONT ROW SEAT. TO THOSE DEEP CUTS I AS WE WERE HERE AT THE CAPITOL. DURING THOSE YEARS THAT THOSE CUTS WERE MADE. NOT MARKER POSITIONS IS ELECTED OFFICIALS BUT CERTAIN AS PART OF THIS INSTITUTION. AND THE REALITY IS THAT EACH AND EVERY YEAR THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF COMPROMISE DISCUSSION NEGOTIATION AND THE BUDGET CONTINUES TO SPEND ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ON ONGOING PROGRAMS SO IF THE REALITY WERE THIS YEAR WE WERE GONNA MAKE ALL CHOICES FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE SURPLUS ONLY TO GO. TO ONE TIME SPENDING THEN. PERHAPS THE CURRENT STRUCTURE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT I BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S NOT REALITY AND NOT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE STATE BUDGET SO I THINK. GIVING OURSELVES AT LEAST THE CHOICE TO PUT ASIDE ISSUE REVENUES TO PROTECT SOME THAT ARE GOING SPENDING A AS WE MAKE THOSE CHOICES. AS A BODY. SEEMS LIKE RATIONAL POLICY TO GET STILL. THERE'S NO MANDATE WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL TO PUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY ASIDE SHIP PERCENTAGE WOULD JUST SIMPLY GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY IF WE. DEEM IT APPROPRIATE RESPONSIBLE TO DO SO. THANK YOU DOCTOR RENTAL. THIS QUESTION IS FROM US COST ACTING YOU EDUCATE THIS BODY ON THE CAP OF THE BSA IF THERE WERE ANY LGISLATIVE OR STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE CAP. WHAT COULD WE FEASIBLY DO TO TRY TO INCREASE THE RESERVES AS HAS BEEN STATED HERE? SURE AND I ALSO WANT TO KNOW A DULY NOTED TO MISTER OBERNOLTE ON. ASSET FOR YOU NOT BEING A CAP AT THE TRIGGER SAID JUST MEAN THERE'S CHOICES TO BE MADE BASED ON THE LEVEL OF FUNDING YOU PROVIDE WITHIN CERTAIN RESERVES. SO IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND I WOULD NOTE PROPOSITION TWO WAS PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY BY THE LEGISLATURE AT THE TIME AND RECEIVED VERY HIGH. UP VOTE MARGIN FROM VOTERS ON IN BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS ONCE YOU REACH THAT TEN PERCENT OF THE BILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE I'M CITING IS THE PROVISION OF PROPOSITION TWO WHICH BASICALLY STATES THAT. ONCE YOU REACH THE TEN PERCENT CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET THE HOT SPILLOVER AMOUNT IS THAN FUNDED UP FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND RIGHT NOW WORK PROJECTING THAT TO BE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS. ON AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW THE UNDERPINNING OF THE POLICY AT THE TIME WAS AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A RELATIVELY VOLATILE REVENUE SOURCE. AND THAT SOME OF THE CALCULATION OF PROPOSITION TWO IS ACTUALLY BASED OFF CAPITAL GAINS ONE OF THE MOST VOLATILE REVENUE SOURCES WE HAVE. HE'D REALLY VIEW THAT AS ONE TIME IN NATURE AND SO INFRASTRUCTURE IS A REASONABLE PLACE TO INVEST ONE TIME DOLLARS. I KNOW WE PUT OUT A FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN RIGHT NOW WITH SIXTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. AND SO. PART OF THE UNDERPINNING OF PROPOSITION TWO THE OTHER PORTION IS OF COURSE FOR PAYING OFF SOME DEBTS. AND SO THERE'S THE RESERVE BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO DEBTS AND LIABILITIES THAT WERE PAIN DOWN THROUGH PROP TO. INFRASTRUCTURE SEEMED A REASONABLE PLACE TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE ONE TIME INVESTMENT GOING FORWARD SO IT REALLY IS A POLICY QUESTION ON IN OUR VIEW PROPOSITION TWO ALLOWED US TO TAKE CARE OF SOME LIABILITIES WE HAD. TO. COME UP WITH A ROBUST RESERVE ON LA ELBOW OFTEN TESTIFYING IT'S THE TRUTH IN BUDGETING. THE RESERVE AMOUNT. A LOT OF THAT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW RISK ADVERSE YOU ARE. A AND THERE IS NO MAGIC NUMBER FOR THE RIGHT RESERVE AMOUNTS. ON TEN PERCENT I THINK MOST PEOPLE FIND PRUDENT ARE MEANT TO. MISS WEBBER'S POINT BALANCING THAT AGAINST SOME OF THE PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET. I'M AND SO WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO TRYING TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH FULLY FUNDING THE BSAA ALLOWS US TO. AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND. HONESTLY WOULD LIKE MORE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IF WE HAVE RIGHT AWAY TO. PUT A BIAS IN THERE BUT. I GUESS THE QUESTION REALLY WAS TO ASK IF WE AS A BODY ARE A BIT MORE RISK ADVERSE WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO DO IF WE WANTED TO INCREASE BEYOND THE TEN PERCENT. AND DO WE HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO HELP TO CHANGE. THAT PERCENTAGE IF WE SO CHOSE TO AND WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO DO TO DO THAT. YEAH THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO CREATE A RESERVE FUND IN THE MEDIA THAT THE BUDGET ALL THE TIME AND DIFFERENT FUND SOURCES. AFFECT YOU AS WINE PSA IS ONE THAT WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY AND CREATED. ON THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I THINK IS AN APPROPRIATE ONE THAT MR MCCARTY RAISES THE FLEXIBILITY THE BILL BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY MIRRORS MANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT YOU HOP AND PROPOSITION TWO. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE GOVERNOR TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY EITHER THROUGH A NATURAL DISASTER A FISCAL EMERGENCY. SO I THINK IT WAS AT A GOOD POINT TO LOOK AT THIS AND REALLY TWO VENUES. THE AMOUNTS AND WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE AND THE FLEXIBILITY. ON AND SO IN SOME WAYS ON THE BILL BEFORE YOU REPLICATES THE STRUCTURE OF PROPOSITION TWO AND SO THAT THE POLICY QUESTION. ON ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT AFFORD YOU ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY. IN ESSENCE IT REPLICATES THE STRUCTURE OF PROP TWO AND CIRCUMVENTS. THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER PROP TWO AND I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I DON'T ONE OPINE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT CAN BE. ACCOMPLISH STATUTORILY OR NOT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WITHOUT MISTER DALY DID YOU ONE UP CLOSE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FULL DISCUSSION AND THE QUESTIONS AND THE ANALYSIS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING IS VERY VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THIS MORNING. THANK YOU SO THIS. THIS BILL WILL AGAIN GO TO SUSPENSE WHICH WE WILL I TAKE UP AT ARE. TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED MARCH FOURTEENTH SURE. THANK YOU MAY FOURTEENTH I'M SORRY THANK YOU MAY. MARCH FOURTEENTH HAS PASSED. ARE. LET'S START WITH THAT SEEING NO OTHER BUSINESS WE ARE ADJOURNING THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER SIX THANK YOU
