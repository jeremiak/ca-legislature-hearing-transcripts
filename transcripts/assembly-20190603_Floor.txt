HOUSE RESOLUTION THIRTY NINE BY SOME REMEMBER LIMON RELATIVE TO THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TOMORROW. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS TO PROBABLY BRING YOU HOUSE RESOLUTION. THIRTY NINE A RESOLUTION CELEBRATING THE PASSAGE OF WHAT WOULD BECOME THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. IN OUR U. S. CONGRESS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. BUT THE HISTORY OF WOMEN EARNING THE RIGHT TO VOTE GOES BACK MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS. IN JULY EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT REFORMERS ELIZABETH CADY STANTON AND LUCRETIA MOTT ORGANIZED THE FIRST WOMEN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION AT SENECA FALLS IN NEW YORK. TWENTY YEARS LATER IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE THE NATIONAL WOMEN SUFFERING SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION LED BY SUSAN B. ANTHONY AND ELIZABETH CADY STANTON WAS FORMED TO ADVOCATE. ON AMENDMENTS THAT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD GRANT WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IN THAT SAME YEAR A POWERFUL ACTIVIST LUCY STONE FORMED THE AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION TO PURSUE A STATE BY STATE STRATEGY TO PASS SUCH AN AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS WERE UNITED TO CREATE THE NATIONAL AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION. AND THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN CONTINUED. AS WITH MANY THINGS. AS OF MANY GREAT THINGS THAT POLICY STARTED IN CALIFORNIA THE WORDING OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT BY SENATOR AARON SERGEANT FROM CALIFORNIA. SENATOR SERGEANT WAS AN OUTSPOKEN WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE ADVOCATE HE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN SUPPORT OF THE AMENDMENT ALONG SIDE FEMALE ACTIVISTS HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED BY YOU THE UNITED STATES SENATE. IN A SIXTEEN TO THIRTY FOUR VOTE IN. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FORTY YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN ALICE PAUL CHAIR OF THE WASHINGTON DC COMMITTEE. OF THE NATIONAL AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION CREATED THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY A POLITICAL PARTY ADVOCATING FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT. THESE INCREDIBLE WOMEN WERE THE FIRST WOMAN IN HISTORY TO PICK AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN. NINETEEN SEVENTEEN IN HIS NINETEEN EIGHTEEN ADDRESS THE U. S. SENATE. TO THE U. S. SENATE PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON RECOGNIZE THE INCREASED ROLE OF AMERICAN WOMEN WERE PLAYING IN OUR SOCIETY. AND YET IT TOOK ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE CONGRESS WOULD PASS A RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT. IT PASSED BY A LARGE MARGIN IN THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN MAY ON MAY TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN NINETEEN BUT ONLY PASSED BY TWO VOTES IN THE U. S. SENATE ENGINE ON JUNE FOURTH. NINETEEN NINETEEN THE AMENDMENT WAS THEN SENT THE UNITED STATES TO THE STATES FOR RATIFICATION. ALTHOUGH SOME STATE LEGISLATURES OPPOSED TO WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM. ON NOVEMBER FIRST NINETEEN NINETEEN THEN GOVERNOR WILLIAM D. STEPHENS CALLED THE SPECIAL SPECIAL SESSION. OF THE LEGISLATURE TO RATIFY THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED THE AMENDMENT ON THAT SAME DAY. IT CAN ALSO BE NOTED THAT CALIFORNIA GRANTED WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE NEARLY A DECADE BEFORE IT WAS THE LAW OF OUR NATION. TODAY ALL FIFTY STATES HAVE RATIFIED THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WHICH STATES THAT. THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO VOTE SHALL NOT BE DENIED. OR ABRIDGED BY ANY UNITED STATES OR BY. ANY STATE ON ACCOUNT OF SEX GUARANTEEING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. LET'S LET US CELEBRATE TODAY AS WE MARK THIS HISTORIC MOMENT THIS WAS NOT AN EASY BATTLE AND IT WAS A BATTLE THAT CONTINUED FOR DECADES UNTIL WE AS WOMEN GUARANTEED THAT. ALL WOMEN INCLUDING WOMEN OF COLOR WOULD FIND OURSELVES FREE TO VOTE. THANK YOU MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE THE FIRST CALL TO BE OPEN TO ADD A CO AUTHORS AND THEN ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON HR THIRTY NINE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. THANK YOU MISS AMOUNT MISS WALDRON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AS THE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHTH WOMAN ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR. THIRTY NINE A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY WOMEN REPRESENTING THE COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE IN. I AS WELL AS THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE OTHER WOMEN HAVE THAT HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS -- BUT WHEN YOU CONTRAST THAT WITH OVER. FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS HAVE SERVED IN OUR STATE LEGISLATURE WE FALLS FAR SHORT OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE NEED TO BE REPRESENTING US HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WOMEN FAR FOR QUALITY AND TODAY WHILE BIG STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE THERE IS STILL WORK TO DO. PAY EQUITY CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE MORE REPRESENTATION ON ELECTED BOARDS COUNCILS AND LEGISLATURE'S. STILL FALLS SHORT. AS WE RECOGNIZE THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO VOTE WE CELEBRATE THE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF WINNING THAT FIGHT. AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TO HONOR THEM TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS WALTER MS KAMLAGER-DOVE YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR. THIRTY NINE AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION TO THE FLOOR. MANY WOMEN AND ALLIES HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO IMPROVE THE WORLD FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT WAS A HUGE VICTORY FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS BUT IT WAS JUST ONE STEP IN GAINING EQUALITY FOR ALL WOMEN. THE FIGHT CONTINUED AS WOMEN IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO A. P. I. AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR DECADES AFTER THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT WAS PASSED. TODAY THE BATTLE TO ATTAIN EQUAL RIGHTS AND EQUAL PAY STILL PERSISTS WOMEN DISPROPORTIONATELY FACE BARRIERS IN EDUCATION AND IN EMPLOYMENT. NOW IS THE TIME TO REFLECT ON THE COURAGE AND THE RESILIENCE OF THOSE WHO HAVE COME BEFORE US. AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS STILL SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION EQUAL PAY FOR COMPARABLE WORK ACCESS TO CHILDCARE AND FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACES. WE MUST FIGHT JUST TO BE SEEN. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I JOIN MY COLLEAGUE IN SUPPORT OF HR THIRTY NINE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE MINS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION GRANTED AMERICAN WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. RATIFIED ON AUGUST EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN TWENTY AND DURING ALMOST A CENTURY OF PROTEST. IN DURING AMERICA'S EARLY HISTORY WOMEN WERE DENIED THE BASIC RIGHTS ENJOYED BY MALE CITIZENS MARRIED WOMAN THEY COULDN'T OWN PROPERTY THEY HAD NO LEGAL CLAIM TO THE MONEY THAT THEY MIGHT EARN. AND THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO VOTE. AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO FOCUS ON HOUSEWORK AND RAISING THE CHILDREN RATHER THAN POLITICS. THE IDEA OF VOTING RIGHTS WAS MARKED BY THE MEDIA IT WAS MARKED. BY THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT GATHERED ENOUGH STEAM TO INFLUENCE AN INFLUENCE TO LOBBY CONGRESS FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. CONGRESS RESPONDED BY DOING WHAT GOVERNMENT BODIES DO BY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO FORM. A COMMISSION AND WE'RE GONNA STUDY IT. AND THEY STUDY THAT. AND WHEN THE PROPOSAL FINALLY REACHED THE SENATE FLOOR IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX IT WAS DEFEATED BY TWO VOTES. BUT THOSE WHO WERE DETERMINED TO SECURE THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR WOMEN DID NOT GIVE UP THANKFULLY. ON MAY TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN NINETEEN U. S. REPRESENTATIVE JAMES R. MANN A REPUBLICAN FROM ILLINOIS IN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE. PROPOSED THE HOUSE RESOLUTION TO APPROVE AMENDMENT GRANTING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IN THE MEASURE FINALLY PASSED THE HOUSE. IN JUNE OF NINETEEN NINETEEN IN JUNE OF NINETEEN NINETEEN THE SENATE VOTED ON THE AMENDMENT GIVEN THEM GIVING THE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THE VOTE CAME AFTER FOUR HOURS OF DEBATE. DURING WHICH SOME DEMOCRATIC SENATORS OPPOSE THE AMENDMENT AND TRIED TO FILIBUSTER. TO PREVENT IT FROM GETTING TO ROLL CALL THAT. THAT. THAT FAILED CLEARLY. THE STATE SEN HAD TO RATIFY HE NEEDED TWO THIRDS TO DO SO BUT THEY WERE ONE STATE SHORT. THE SOUTHERN STATES WERE OPPOSED OKAY SO YOU HAD TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SHE SAID WE CAN COUNT ON THE SOUTHERN STATES WE KNOW THEY WON'T VOTE FOR IT. SO WE IF WE JUST PUT THIS UP TO THE STATE'S THEMSELVES WE SAY THE STATE SHOULD HAVE THIS RIGHT. THEN WE DON'T WANT PASS. THE EFFORT TO LEAVE IT UP TO THE STATE'S THOUGH AB DIDN'T FLY WITH CONGRESS. SO IT CAME DOWN TO TENNESSEE. TENNESSEE OF ALL STATES. IN THE VOTE WAS FORTY EIGHT TO FORTY EIGHT FOUR IN A POST. AND ONE VOTE. PUT IT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE AND THAT WAS FROM TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD REPUBLICAN HARRY T. BURN. WHO WAS NOT? COMPLETELY SOLD ON THE IDEA BUT HIS MOTHER HELPED CONVINCE HIM TO SUPPORT THE ISSUE. SO I WOULD SAY ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER PARTICULAR IN CASES LIKE THIS. I HOPE MY KIDS ARE LISTENING -- SO IT TOOK MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS THOUGH FOR THE TWELVE REMAINING STATES TO OFFICIALLY RATIFY. THIS AMENDMENT. THE LAST TO STATE TO DO SO WAS MISSISSIPPI IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR IT'S KIND OF ASTONISHING TO THINK THAT. OVER THE WEEKEND CAL MATTERS PUT OUT A VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO READ IT BUT I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY NOTING HERE WHICH I THOUGHT WERE. KIND OF FASCINATING AND IN SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW ROSEANNE VOYAGE A DAUGHTER OF YUGOSLAV AN INGRID IMMIGRANTS FROM A TINY TULARE COUNTY TOWN. BROKE THE GENDER BARRIER IN THE UPPER HOUSE HERE IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX BEFORE HER THERE HAD BEEN MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED HUNDRED SENATE ELECTIONS ADDED TAKEN PLACE. SINCE STATEHOOD AND MEN HAD ONE ALL OF THEM. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. SO ROSANNE ONE AND THE MEN OF THE SENATE WERE UNSURE OF HOW TO HANDLE THEM A WOMAN'S PRESENCE AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS GREETED WITH NOTHING LESS THAN SHOCK WHICH DOES NOT SURPRISE ME. SO SHE BROUGHT A SMALL PORCELAIN% BELL WITH HER AND KEPT IT AT OUR DESK WHENEVER ONE OF HER COLLEAGUES BEGIN A FLOOR SPEECH WITH GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE. ROSEANNE WOULD RING HER LITTLE BELL TO REMIND THEM THAT A LADY WAS PRESENT IN THE HOUSE AS WELL. TWO YEARS LATER DIANE WATSON BECAME THE SENATE FIRST FEMALE AFRICAN AMERICAN SENATOR. AND I CAMPAIGN BUYS ADVISER OF HERS RECALLED TAKING WATSON ON A MEET AND GREET WITH OTHER BETTER IN LEGISLATORS AND ONE OF THESE VETERAN LEGISLATORS PULLED HIM ASIDE AND SAID. TWO WOMEN IS ENOUGH. SO THAT WAS THE ATTITUDE THAT. WE KNOW THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS MAY HAVE BEEN LONG AND FRUSTRATING BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY IN OUR COUNTRY'S BEST INTEREST. AFTER FORDING WOMEN THE SAME RIGHTS AS MEN. WE SAW MANY OTHER ISSUES OF EQUALITY. PASSED THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE'S WE SAW THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WE SAW THE EQUAL PAY ACT WE SAW THE BEGINNING OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON YOUR RACE OR SEX RELIGION OR YOUR GENDER. AND IF YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER. AS I AM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE BILLIE JEAN KING BEAT THE PANTS OFF A BOBBY RIGGS AND A NATIONALLY TELEVISED TENNIS MATCH BECAUSE HE SAID THE WOMEN'S SPORTS DIDN'T MATCH UP TO MEN'S AND SHE PROVED WRONG. SEVENTY ONE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR WAS SWORN IN BY PRESIDENT REAGAN AS THE FIRST WOMAN TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. SALLY RIDE BECAME THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN IN SPACE ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE ASK -- CHALLENGER. WHEN I WAS A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL I SAW THE FIRST FEMALE VICE PRESIDENT CANDIDATE GERALDINE FERRARO AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING THAT FUNNY THEY HAD A WOMAN? WHO'S IN WHO'S AT LEAST RUNNING FOR A POSITION LIKE THAT. IN TWO THOUSAND ONE CONDOLEEZZA RICE BECAME THIS COUNTRY'S FIRST WOMAN TO SERVE AS A NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH AND SHE'S ALSO THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO SERVICE SECRETARY STATE. SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF PHENOMENAL WOMEN THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THEM MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED SOME OF THEM AS WELL BUT ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT. PARTY POLITICS DON'T MATTER NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE SOLIDARITY THAT THE WOMEN HAVE ENJOYED THROUGHOUT HISTORY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO BE HERE. SOON MY FELLOW FEMALE LEGISLATORS THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DO IN FIGHTING THE FIGHT TO MY MALE COLLEAGUES. WE ARE PLEASED TO BE SERVING HERE WITH YOU I URGE AYE ABOUT. THANK YOU MS MELENDEZ.
