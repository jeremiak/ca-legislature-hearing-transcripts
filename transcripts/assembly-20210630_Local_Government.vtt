THEIR WATER IS SAFE AND THAT

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:46.599
IMPOSES A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:48.167

02:53:57.160 --> 02:53:59.295
PORTAL. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT I

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:01.497
BELIEVE ONLINE SO WE HAVE A

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:02.665
WRITTEN TESTIMONY CAN COME

02:54:02.732 --> 02:54:04.534
THROUGH A POSITION PORTAL ON A

02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:07.036
COMMITTEE AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:54:07.103 --> 02:54:09.338
COMMITTEE WEBSITE. OKAY SO-

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:10.873
WILL MOVE TO QUESTIONS OF THE

02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:14.577
COMMITTEE. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:54:14.644 --> 02:54:16.579
LACKING. YEAH I'D LIKE TO BEGIN

02:54:16.646 --> 02:54:18.581
BY- APOLOGIZING FOR THE

02:54:18.648 --> 02:54:20.683
DURATION OF. DISRESPECTING

02:54:20.750 --> 02:54:21.617
SUPPRESSION BY A NUMBER OF THE

02:54:21.684 --> 02:54:24.253
COLLAR'S NOT WAS INEXCUSABLE NO

02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:27.190
MATTER WHAT THEIR POSITION HAS-

02:54:27.256 --> 02:54:29.692
BUT AS I MOVE ON THE LANGUAGE

02:54:29.759 --> 02:54:31.460
ALLOWING THIS BILL TO AUTHORIZE

02:54:31.527 --> 02:54:33.129
THE CITY COUNCIL TO OVERTURN

02:54:33.196 --> 02:54:34.630
VOTER APPROVAL ORDINANCES SEEMS

02:54:34.697 --> 02:54:37.366
TO BE A BIG OBSTACLE AND I KNOW

02:54:37.433 --> 02:54:40.903
YOU DRESSED TO LAST TIME- ARE

02:54:40.970 --> 02:54:42.705
YOU UNWILLING TO ADDRESS THAT.

02:54:42.772 --> 02:54:44.140
THROUGH THE AMENDMENT PROCESS

02:54:44.207 --> 02:54:46.142
SERVER HOW HOW. HOW FOR MORE

02:54:46.209 --> 02:54:48.110
YOU ON THAT ISSUE SURE AND IF I

02:54:48.177 --> 02:54:49.612
GET THE SIX CERTIFIED PREACHER

02:54:49.679 --> 02:54:50.313
THAT I REMEMBER OUR

02:54:50.379 --> 02:54:51.447
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LAST

02:54:51.514 --> 02:54:55.418
YEAR. SO LAST THE WHAT WE DID

02:54:55.484 --> 02:54:58.855
THIS YEAR. IS WE MADE IT.

02:54:58.921 --> 02:55:00.890
INSTEAD OF REMOVING WE MET

02:55:00.957 --> 02:55:05.428
DRAMATICALLY NARROWER- AND- YOU

02:55:05.494 --> 02:55:06.796
KNOW THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE

02:55:06.863 --> 02:55:08.164
THERE ARE SOME CITIES IN

02:55:08.231 --> 02:55:11.000
CALIFORNIA IT IS A- SMALL

02:55:11.067 --> 02:55:14.470
NUMBER- THAT BUT BUT- IT COULD

02:55:14.537 --> 02:55:17.006
GROW- THAT HAVE MADE IT

02:55:17.073 --> 02:55:19.342
EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR

02:55:19.408 --> 02:55:20.710
CITY COUNCIL EVEN TO ADOPT THE

02:55:20.776 --> 02:55:22.245
HOUSING ELEMENT BECAUSE THEY

02:55:22.311 --> 02:55:24.146
PROVIDE THAT THE ONLY WAY. YOU

02:55:24.213 --> 02:55:26.749
CAN EVEN MOVE A COMMA IN TERMS

02:55:26.816 --> 02:55:27.717
OF THE ZONING CODE THE PLAN

02:55:27.783 --> 02:55:30.953
CODE. IS TO GO TO THE VOTERS-

02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:32.054
AND SO WE HAVE CITIES IN

02:55:32.121 --> 02:55:33.756
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THEY'RE

02:55:33.823 --> 02:55:35.591
LITERALLY INCAPACITATED FROM

02:55:35.658 --> 02:55:37.360
ADOPTING EVEN HOUSING ELEMENT

02:55:37.426 --> 02:55:38.628
AND DOING ANY ZONING WORK

02:55:38.694 --> 02:55:42.031
WHATSOEVER- AND SO. WHAT WE DID

02:55:42.098 --> 02:55:43.566
WAS WE BASICALLY NARROWED IT

02:55:43.633 --> 02:55:44.967
DOWN TO THAT VERY NARROW

02:55:45.034 --> 02:55:48.137
SUBCLASS GETTING RID OF THE- IT

02:55:48.204 --> 02:55:49.805
WHEN YOU LOOK AT. BALLOT

02:55:49.872 --> 02:55:50.640
MEASURES THAT RESTRICT

02:55:50.706 --> 02:55:52.975
DEVELOPMENT OVERWHELMINGLY THEY

02:55:53.042 --> 02:55:55.611
ARE OPEN SPACE PROTECTION GREEN

02:55:55.678 --> 02:55:57.546
BELT THOSE KINDS OF PROMISES

02:55:57.613 --> 02:55:58.848
THAT WERE ALL FAMILIAR WITH AND

02:55:58.915 --> 02:56:00.483
WE SAW OVER THE STATE. WE

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:01.617
REMOVE THOSE FROM THE BILL

02:56:01.684 --> 02:56:03.552
ENTIRELY AND THAT'S THE LARGE

02:56:03.619 --> 02:56:06.522
MAJORITY OF THEM- AND SO WE

02:56:06.589 --> 02:56:08.224
MADE A MUCH NARROWER TO FOCUS

02:56:08.291 --> 02:56:10.359
ON THE VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT

02:56:10.426 --> 02:56:11.928
HAS CREATED A PROBLEM A NUMBER

02:56:11.994 --> 02:56:13.162
OF COMMUNITIES. WHERE THEY'RE

02:56:13.229 --> 02:56:14.630
NOT EVEN ABLE TO COMPLY WITH

02:56:14.697 --> 02:56:16.532
STATE HOUSING LAWS WE'VE HAD

02:56:16.599 --> 02:56:18.100
ALSO INCREASED THE THRESHOLD

02:56:18.167 --> 02:56:20.803
EVEN FOR THAT NARROW BANDS.

02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:22.338
HAVING REMOVED THE LARGE

02:56:22.405 --> 02:56:24.340
MAJORITY ENTIRELY FOR THAT ARE

02:56:24.407 --> 02:56:26.208
BAD MAKING IT A TWO THIRDS VOTE

02:56:26.275 --> 02:56:28.477
AND SEVEN MAJORITY VOTE WAS ON

02:56:28.544 --> 02:56:29.912
MOST COUNCILS PICA BEFORE OUT

02:56:29.979 --> 02:56:32.281
OF FIVE FOR THE- YOU KNOW I

02:56:32.348 --> 02:56:32.848
THINK THE MOST COMMON FORM

02:56:32.915 --> 02:56:37.687
COUNCIL- AND AS YOU KNOW- YOU

02:56:37.753 --> 02:56:41.924
KNOW. AS AS MY COLLEAGUE IN THE

02:56:41.991 --> 02:56:43.192
SENATE SENATOR. WHO THE LOCAL

02:56:43.259 --> 02:56:45.194
GUY YOUR THEM OVER MY HOUSING

02:56:45.261 --> 02:56:46.996
BILLS SAID HE SAID IN THAT

02:56:47.063 --> 02:56:49.365
NARROW THIS NARROW SUBSET. YOU

02:56:49.432 --> 02:56:49.999
KNOW COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE

02:56:50.066 --> 02:56:52.234
ACCOUNTABLE. TO THEIR VOTERS I

02:56:52.301 --> 02:56:53.269
KNOW WHEN I WAS IN LOCAL

02:56:53.336 --> 02:56:54.036
GOVERNMENT LAWS NUMBER

02:56:54.103 --> 02:56:55.738
SUPERVISORS THERE WERE SOME

02:56:55.805 --> 02:56:58.975
SITUATIONS. WHERE WE WERE ABLE

02:56:59.041 --> 02:57:00.443
TO OVERRIDE OR CHANGE BALLOT

02:57:00.509 --> 02:57:03.879
MEASURES- AND I DOUBT SOME OF

02:57:03.946 --> 02:57:06.148
THAT I WAS TAKEN EXTREMELY

02:57:06.215 --> 02:57:07.717
SERIOUSLY FOR THE REASONS THAT

02:57:07.783 --> 02:57:08.651
ALL OF US AROUND LOCAL

02:57:08.718 --> 02:57:10.920
GOVERNMENT. UNDERSTAND SO I

02:57:10.987 --> 02:57:12.488
DON'T SEE THIS IS SOMETHING

02:57:12.555 --> 02:57:13.322
WORK COUNCILS ARE GOING TO ****

02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:15.558
NILLY. DO THAT BUT IN A WAY IT

02:57:15.624 --> 02:57:17.626
IS A SAFETY VALVE. FOR THAT

02:57:17.693 --> 02:57:20.029
VERY SMALL SUBSET OF CITIES

02:57:20.096 --> 02:57:21.597
THAT HAVE THESE. BALLOT

02:57:21.664 --> 02:57:22.631
MEASURES THAT MAKE IT REALLY

02:57:22.698 --> 02:57:24.300
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO EVEN

02:57:24.367 --> 02:57:24.900
COMPLY WITH THAT LAW SO WE

02:57:24.967 --> 02:57:26.736
TRIED TO. IN SEVERAL LIMITING

02:57:26.802 --> 02:57:30.806
IT SAYS REALLY NARROW AND-POCASSET AND MAKE A RAZOR SHARP

02:57:30.873 --> 02:57:31.874
SO THAT'S WHAT I EXPLANATION OF

02:57:31.941 --> 02:57:34.877
HOW WE- GOT HERE. IS THAT A

02:57:34.944 --> 02:57:36.245
CONTINUING CONVERSATION OF

02:57:36.312 --> 02:57:38.881

YOU KNOW THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:41.784
SUBJECT MATTER BUT WE TRIED TO

02:57:41.851 --> 02:57:45.254
THREAD THAT NEEDLE. WELL I DO

02:57:45.321 --> 02:57:46.455
AGREE WITH THE- SENATOR GLAZERS

02:57:46.522 --> 02:57:47.857
ASSESSMENT HAVING SERVED ON THE

02:57:47.923 --> 02:57:49.458
CITY COUNCIL FOR NINE YEARS AND

POTENTIALLY ADIOS TO THAT. THAT

02:57:57.033 --> 02:58:00.369

ANALYSIS IT DID SAY THAT THESE

02:59:10.039 --> 02:59:12.374
ZONES TEND TO BE MORE RURAL AND

02:59:12.441 --> 02:59:14.777
THAT'S NOT THE CASE. IN MY

02:59:14.844 --> 02:59:17.713
DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES- AND SO

OF THE VERY HIGH RISK AREAS.

02:59:47.343 --> 02:59:49.745
THOSE MAPS- ARE EXEMPT FROM THE

02:59:49.812 --> 02:59:52.648
BILL- BUT THEN THERE IS AN

02:59:52.715 --> 02:59:54.683
EXCEPTION TO THAT EXEMPTION

02:59:54.750 --> 02:59:56.752
THAT'S REPRESENTS- THAT IF A

02:59:56.819 --> 03:00:00.256
CITY. AND ITS FIRE MARSHAL HAVE

03:00:00.322 --> 03:00:01.490
BASICALLY DETERMINED THAT A

03:00:01.557 --> 03:00:03.459
PARTICULAR AREA HAS BEEN

03:00:03.526 --> 03:00:05.628

NEIGHBORHOOD OR BLOCK- SAFER SO

03:00:17.740 --> 03:00:19.508
THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY THAT AREA

03:00:19.575 --> 03:00:21.677
IS NO LONGER. AT THAT SAME

03:00:21.744 --> 03:00:23.846
LEVEL OF RISK AND THAT WOULD BE

03:00:23.913 --> 03:00:24.480
OKAY AND THAT WOULD BE A LOCAL

03:00:24.547 --> 03:00:26.482
DECISION. YOU KNOW IN

03:00:26.549 --> 03:00:28.517
CONSULTATION WITH THE LOCAL

THAT HAS TO USE SO THAT'S-

03:00:35.424 --> 03:00:37.526
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS I KNOW-

03:00:37.593 --> 03:00:38.460
THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER

03:00:38.527 --> 03:00:39.762
ISSUES IN THE SUMMER BLOOMING

HISTORICALLY AND IN RECENT

03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:27.616
