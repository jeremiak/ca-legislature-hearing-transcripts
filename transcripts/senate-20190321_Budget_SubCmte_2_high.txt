WAIT TILL THE END OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PRESENTATION TO MAKE THE SAID OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. SECTION IF WE'RE ACTUALLY GET TAKEN ACTION AND I WILL LAST THE PUBLIC COMMENT DURING THE TIME TO WIN THE MATTERS PRESENTED -- WITH THAT A LATE WAY FOR MYSELF COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TO COME FORWARD AND WE WILL JUMP TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN IF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. IS HERE. WE HAVE. ISSUE NUMBER -- SEVEN MORNING. GOOD MORNING HAPPY. BRING I GUESS SPRING START YESTERDAY. WHEN IS AMIR FOR SURE? THE MORNING WAS CHAIR -- JARVIS CALLIE PA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD TODAY I WILL BE VERY BRIEF OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF YOUR YOUR BIG AGENDA. I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES BEFORE YOU THAT I KNOW YOU CAN ONLY VOTE THEM BUT I JUST I JUST WANTED TO SAY -- THAT THE YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION AND AND FINANCE AND I I AND ALL OF US TRIED. TO PUT FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE. YOUR LIFE EASIER TURN PROCESS PAPERWORK LITTLE MORE EFFICIENTLY SO OUR INTENT WAS PURE BUT I THINK OUR EXECUTION WAS LACKING. AND SO AS THE AS STAFF -- FOR NOTED TO MANAGE COLLEGE SIZE FOR THAT BUT I THINK -- AND I'LL DEFER TO FINANCE WITH ANY OTHER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON THAT PROCESS. BUT IN TERMS OF OUR OUR ONE ITEM AND I'LL JUST BRIEFLY SAY THAT -- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SMALL GRANTS OR IS NOTHING NEW TO YOU ALL AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND IT IS TRULY A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THERE'S NO CHANGE IN DOLLARS OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE -- THERE ARE OTHER BIG ITEMS ON THE LIST TRAINING TO SEVERAL OF OUR BOARDS FARMS IN OFFICES AND THEY'RE HERE AS WELL BEHIND ME IN CASE YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE. TERMS IS SIX SEVENTEEN I KNOW THAT I I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT'LL PROBABLY BE A BIGGER DISCUSSION ITEM. BUT WE WANT TO CLEAR UP ONE LITTLE -- WE THINK THE ONE LITTLE MISS MISCOMMUNICATION PART ON OUR OFFER US EXCUSE ME -- TWENTY TWO POSITIONS THAT ARE WERE ASKING FOR THEY ARE PERMANENT POSITIONS THERE SO THEY WERE ESTABLISHED PERMANENT WHICH IS SEEKING FUNDING FOR THOSE POSITIONS. AND THIS IS -- MOVING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENT AND I'LL JUST. CUT OFF THERE AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GOOD GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LA -- THE BIGGER ISSUE AROUND TO SERVE THE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS A B. C. P. IN THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED I THINK WE'VE COVERED THAT I THINK IN SOME PREVIOUS TESTIMONY -- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD ABOUT THE LITTLE DETAIL ON SOME OF THE PROPOSALS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WORK WITH THEM ON KIND OF WHAT'S APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF INFORMATION FOR YOU TO CONDUCT YOUR OVERSIGHT OVER SOME OF THOSE REQUESTS -- I DON'T KNOW MISTER CHAIR IF YOU WOULD LIKE -- TO DISCUSS SB SIX SEVENTEEN POSITIONS. RIGHT NOW IT'S SO I CAN. WHY SINCE WE SPLIT THEM UP AND SEVEN SEVEN A WE GOT THE WE OVERVIEW AND WHICH WOULD INCLUDE IT I'D LIKE TO YOU KNOW IT'S THE INTENT TO HOLD? THE OTHER OF VARIOUS TECHNICAL ISSUES AND GET -- TO AB SIX SEVENTEEN IN GENERAL. OUR SPECIFICALLY -- THE RECOMMENDATION OR CALLING SAYS ANY HAVE BODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON JUST THE VARIOUS TECHNICAL. ADJUSTMENTS UNDER ISSUE SEVEN STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD IT OPEN -- THING NINE WILL TAKE NO ACTION ON THAT AND THEN NOW GOING. TO SIX SEVENTEEN WHAT WE START WITH THE LA -- AND WE'LL GO BACK. TO SURE YEAH SO. I THINK WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE YOU KNOW MOST OF THE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS PROPOSALS I THINK THE ONE EXCEPTION IS AS WAS MENTIONED -- THE REQUEST TO EXTEND FUNDING. FOR TWENTY TWO MISSIONS THAT WAS PART OF THAT TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT BCP JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLAURE APPROVED -- FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS A NEW PROGRAM FOCUSED ON COMMUNITY LEVEL AIR POLLUTION MONITORING AND EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AS PART OF THAT ACTION -- THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR TWENTY TWO POSITIONS IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THAT WAS A NEW PROGRAM THAT WAS GETTING UP GOING TO AND THE ONGOING WORKLOAD WAS UNCERTAIN. AND IN SOME CASES SORT OF THE NATURE OF THE WORK -- THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE BY CARB. MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN THE INITIAL YEARS OF THE PROGRAM RAMPS UP COMPARED TO ONCE IT'S ON GOING AND DISTRICTS PLAY. A MORE A ROLE IN KIND OF THAT CONTINUING MONITORING AN EMISSION REDUCTION PLANNING ACTIVITIES. THE REQUESTS WAS TO EXTEND THIS FUNDING FOR THOSE TWENTY TWO LIMITED TERM POSITIONS THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT BCP. ORIGINALLY THERE WAS NO DETAIL -- PROVIDED FOR THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE WORKLOAD THE WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT THOSE -- TWENTY TWO POSITIONS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. SUBSEQUENTLY WE ASK CARP TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THEY PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON JUST THAT THE GENERAL TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE ON GOING THAT THESE. POSITIONS WOULD SUPPORT. THERE WAS NOT -- A DETAILED QUANTIFICATION OF THE WORKLOAD TO JUSTIFY THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO POSITIONS BEYOND THE FIFTY POSITIONS AND SO IN OUR FEBRUARY -- BUDGET ANALYSIS WE RECOMMENDED THE TWENTY TWO POSITIONS -- DUE TO INSUFFICIENT WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATION I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT -- SINCE OUR RECOMMENDATION CAME OUT IN OUR SAID DORI BUDGET ANALYSIS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION REGARDING THE ON GOING WORK THOUGH THEY EXPECT FOR AB SIX SEVENTEEN TO SUPPORT THE THE OVERALL SEVENTY TWO POSITIONS INCLUDING THE TWENTY TWO THAT ARE THE FOCUS HERE. WE'RE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THAT INFORMATION AND IN FACT WE HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED WITH CARP TO KIND OF GO OVER THAT WORKLOAD INFORMATION MORE DETAIL NEXT WEEK AND WE'LL UPDATE THE COMMITTEE. AS NECESSARY YEAH IN YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO CHECK WITHOUT PREJUDICE SO EVERYBODY IS WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE FINANCE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD. JULIANNE MOORE IS A ME WITH FINANCE. THANK YOU -- CHAIR WHITE HOUSE KEY WE OKAY -- OR SOFT SPOKE YOUR WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LA -- AND A A RP IN WORKING OUT -- THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WORK IS IMPORTANT. AND IT THE WORKLOAD IS IS TREMENDOUS FOR IT AND THEN GIVEN. THURMOND NOW YESTERDAY MONDAY'S HEARING. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S JUST AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON THIS. SO WE WOULD LIKE WE WOULD. WE LOOK FORWARD TO COMING BACK LATER IN THE SPRING. I WHEN HERE FROM THE H. SAID JUST. REFRESH EVERYONE'S MEMORY WHEN WHEN THIS MATTER CAME BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY COMMITTEE WE HAD EVERY REGIONAL AIRPORT WAS OBJECTING BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING TO ITSELF THE BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND HISTORICALLY. THE POLLUTER HAS PAID AND HERE'S WERE ASKING FOR G. G. R. F. MONIES TO PAY FOR TO MEASURE THE POLLUTION WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE AND I AM SURE YOU GUYS ARE AWARE OF THIS. THAT WE CAN USE EXISTING STATIONS WITH THE AIR QUALITY STATIONS AND IN IN A GREAT THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S WARNING ON FIRES WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE HAVE OF WHAT A LOT A LITTLE COMPUTERS A LITTLE STATIONS OUT THERE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL SO WE'RE WHILE I WAS. CHALLENGED WHEN WE WERE HAVING A HEARING ON SIX SEVENTEEN IN THE WAY THAT THAT WENT DOWN I'M SURELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE ARE -- EXPRESSING TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE'RE DOING THIS WE'RE NIMBLE AND WE'RE USING THE EXISTING FACILITIES THAT THE STATES HAVE AND THE AND NETWORKS FOR TELEPHONE AND ALL THAT TO PUT THESE TO MAKE THE MOVE. THE APPOINTMENT THAT'S ALREADY ON THE POLLS WORK BETTER BUT PLACES HERE FROM ANYTHING ELSE IN THE AGENCY. WELL I'LL JUST CHECK -- THAT'S THAT'S THAT THOSE ARE IT'S A VALID POINT AND I KNOW THAT THEIR BE HAS AN OUTREACH COMPONENT TO THIS AND THEY'RE WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS ISSUES JUST AS JUST AS YOU JUST LAID OUT. AND OF COURSE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LA -- AND FINANCING YOUR STAFF TO WORK THAT OUT SO WE CAN PUT FORTH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY SINK YOUR TEETH INTO. AND ANALYZE GOING FORWARD. OKAY LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM PLEASE. CALL THE ROLL. MY COUNTY HERE DOWNS MCGUIRE. YOUR MORNING HERE STERN. OKAY -- THIS IS THE THE CHAIR WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO RECHECK BUT BEFORE KNOWLEDGE I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS MATTER HI THIS IS. EIGHTY SEVEN A VARIOUS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS REGARDING AB. SIX SEVENTEEN PLEASE COME. FOR A GOOD MORNING MY CLAIBORNE I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL TO HAVE FUN THEY ADDITIONAL 22% ARE THE CURRENT TWENTY TWO POSITIONS FOR A BE. SIX ONE SEVEN LEADERSHIP COUNCIL'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT BASED IN FRESNO AND WE HAVE OFFICES IN BAKERSFIELD. AND EAST COACHELLA -- AND IN OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST A YEAR OR SO A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN HAS BEEN A CRITICAL AND NECESSARY TOOL. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY MULTIPLE SOURCES OF POLLUTION. CAR MUST PLAY POLITICAL CRITICAL ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING AND REGULARLY UPDATING THE STATEWIDE AIR MONITORING -- PLAN AND STATEWIDE STRATEGY FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN ADDITION TO ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION BLUEPRINT. THEY WILL ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE TIMELY ACCURATE EMISSIONS DATA REPORTING TO FULFILL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE KIDS -- COMMUNITY EMISSIONS INVENTORY. MOST IMPORTANTLY CARB IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTING ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY IS TO BE PART OF THIS PROGRAM. AND THIS WILL ALL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES -- IN BOTH FRESNO AND COACHELLA WHERE WERE MOST INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM CAR STAFF SUPPORT AND RESOURCES. HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE AND SORELY NEEDED WE WOULD SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR I APOLOGIZE I NEGLECTED TO REFER TO CAR THEY DID ONCE HE IF YOU ARE A FEW WORDS -- I HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING PUBLIC TESTIMONY. PLEASE COVER MIKE. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU -- I'M KAREN MOLLY AUTO AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY ARE PROTECTION AT CARB AND WE IMPLEMENTED THE OFFICE HERE TO SO WE COULD HAVE THE CAR PRESENCE IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM -- SO I UST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ON THE LA -- IN YOU -- IN PROVIDING THAT ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION ABOUT THE INTENSIVE WORK THAT'S GOING FORWARD I'M AS YOU HEARD GIULIANA MENTIONED WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING IN ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES ON MONDAY. TO HEAR FROM US TO HEAR FROM THE AIR DISTRICTS -- AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THE MEMBERS FROM THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES WHICH ARE REALLY SERVING AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM. AND ONE OF THE KEY MESSAGES THAT CAME FORWARD AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM THIS TESTIMONY FROM LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WAS THE NEED FOR CARP TO PLAY A STRONG ROLE IN THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM. I'M ESPECIALLY TO BE A BRIDGE AS PART OF THAT PROGRAM A BRIDGE -- TO WORK WITH BOTH AIR DISTRICTS LIMIT THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS A BRIDGE TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES -- THAT REALLY HAVE A ROLE IN HELPING TO PROVIDE REDUCTIONS IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- AND THE TWENTY TWO POSITIONS THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING TODAY ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT ARE ON THE GROUND WORKING WITH THE AIR DISTRICTS AND THE COMMUNITIES TO BE THAT. BRIDGE FOR THE PROGRAM AND BRING THE COMMUNITY VOICES AND PRIORITIES BACK TO CARB SO THAT WE CAN THEN WORK WITHIN OUR AGENCY TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND THEN WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO BRING THEM INTO THIS PROCESS AS WELL AND THIS IS REALLY A LONG TERM COMMITMENT. TO THESE COMMUNITIES WE SET UP THE PROGRAM SO THEY NEED TO PROVIDE -- A FIVE YEAR A MISSION REDUCTION PLAN AND THEN CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS -- AND OUR ROLE IS REALLY A COMMITMENT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS. SO I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE CHECK MY TOWN WHAT'S. OPEN IT UP MEMBERS OF THE PANEL ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE OF EPA OR CENTER STERN THANK YOU MISTER JUST VERY BRIEFLY SO THESE WOULD BE -- FOR POSITIONS IT LOCATED IN VARIOUS AIR DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY ARE LOCATED BOTH IN SACRAMENTO AND I'M DOWN IN OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OFFICE -- BUT THEY GO TO AND PARTICIPATE IN EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEE -- pIMPLEMENTING THE WORK IN THESE INITIAL TEN COMMUNITIES. DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY TO PARTICULAR TWENTY TWO COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON OR ARE. THERE ARE TEN COMMUNITIES OVERALL -- SO WE HAVE DEDICATED STAFF BOTH FROM SORT OF A POLICY STRATEGY PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT. TO EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND THEN THE OTHER KEY ELEMENT -- OF THE TWENTY TWO POSITIONS IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR US TO DEVELOP IMPROVE TECHNICAL TOOLS TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. AND ONE OF THOSE IS A TECHNOLOGY CLEARING HOUSE SO YOU KNOW AS WE GET BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT. WHAT PEOPLE ARE BREATHING WHAT THE SOURCES ARE IN THE COMMUNITY IT THEN REALLY GOES TO HOW DO WE REDUCE THAT POLLUTION IN THE TECHNOLOGY CLEARING HOUSE? IS DESIGNED TO BE THAT SOURCE FOR WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES IN PLACE TODAY BUT ALSO AS WE LOOK FORWARD WHAT KINDS OF MORE ADVANCED ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES ARE COMING ON TO THE SCENE [inaudible] SENATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANNA. SHE THAT CLARIFICATION AS A RECENT APPOINTEE TO THE CARDBOARD I AM LEARNING ABOUT THE WORK -- PARTICULARLY IN THESE TEN COMMUNITIES AND IMPART PICKED BECAUSE OF HIGH -- PUBLIC HEALTH. CHALLENGES WITH HIGH INCIDENCE OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN ETCETERA SO IT'S IT'S CLEARLY THE RIGHT PLACE FOR OUR ENERGIES TO BE DIRECTED IN. I GUESS MY QUESTION MISTER CHAIR I APOLOGIZE FOR GETTING HERE A LITTLE LATE. I JUST WOULD ASK FOR YOUR CLARIFICATION FOR ME ON THE RECOMMENDATION.

OKAY THAT MATTERS APPROVED A FOUR ONE ARE THOSE MATTERS ARE APPROVED FOR ONCE LET'S CONTINUE ON WITH OUR GENDER AND CALL UP A WE HA. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER. HOPEFULLY IT'S EIGHT ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT HOT SPOT PROGRAM. GOOD MORNING [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. THE MORNING OF CHAIRMAN Y. CASKEY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I'M LAURIN SIZE SIGN OF TO RESTORE WITH. OKAY. OKAY BY LAWRENCE ICE I'M DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT OR A WE HOW AND WITH ME IS OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. ALAN HIRSCH -- SO -- WE IS IS IN A CALL HE IN. SIX SEVENTEEN AND AS THE BILL'S IMPLEMENTATION HAS PROGRESSED. ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING HEALTH IMPACTS IN THE BILL'S ACTIVITIES. AND THIS FORMS THE BASIS OF A WE HAS ROLE IN SIX SEVENTEEN GIVEN OUR CORE EXPERTISE IN EVALUATING HEALTH IMPACTS. OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS. WE'RE REQUESTING FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AN ANNUAL CONTRACT FOR THREE YEARS FOR A TOTAL OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND AND FUNDING FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND TO SUPPORT CARD. LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND IMPACT TO COMMUNITIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIX SEVENTEEN AND THE REQUESTED -- WE HAVE STAFF AND CONTRACT FUNDS WILL PROVIDE FIRST EXPERTISE. IN THE INTERPRETATION OF POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM. EXPOSURES TO AIR TOXICS OBSERVED THROUGH AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA. AND THE EVALUATION POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS FROM REDUCING THOSE EXPOSURES SO TO PUT IT SIMPLY WHEN COMMUNITIES ON IN THE STEERING COMMITTEES ARE CONSIDERING. CHEMICALS TO MONITOR AND READ WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACTS AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REDUCTION SAID AND THE MONITORING THAT'S BEING. CONSIDERED. THE SECOND THING IS TO DEVELOP HEALTH GUIDANCE VALUES NEEDED TO FULLY ANALYZE HEALTH EFFECTS AND THE BENEFITS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS TO THOSE. POLLUTANTS THESE GUIDANCE VALUES TYPICALLY IDENTIFY LEVELS OF AIRBORNE POLLUTANTS THAT DO NOT POSE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISKS. SO WITH THE MONITORING. SHOWS LEVELS OF A POLLUTANT ABOVE THE GUIDANCE LEVEL IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH RISKS WE HAVE -- GUIDANCE LEVELS FOR MANY CONTAMINANTS. WE'RE ANTICIPATING THE NEED FOR GUIDANCE VALUES FOR MANY MORE. THE SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD ERMS OF WHAT MONITORED AND WHAT'S IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE MISSIONS INVENTORIES. AND THE THIRD THING IS FOR THE DESIGN. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TARGETED BY A MONITORING STUDIES TO TRACK EXPOSURES IN COMMUNITIES. SO BY MONITORING PROVIDES LEVEL -- INFORMATION ON WHAT'S IN PEOPLE CHEMICALS AND IN THAT ARE MEASURED IN HUMANS AND IT'S SO IT'S A REAL DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF EXPOSURE. AND BIOMONITORING ANSWERS KEY QUICK KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL AND EXTENT OF EXPOSURE -- POLLUTION CAN VARY WIDELY ACROSS A GIVEN AREA. AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE A LARGE BLUE -- CONTINUOUS ARE LARGE POLLUTANT SOURCES ARE KIND OF A IN A SPECIAL CONCERN. IN BY A MONITORING CAN HELP IDENTIFY INCREASE LEVELS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. SO -- SO THE TARGET CAN COMPLEMENT. EXISTING MONITORING. THE MASS THE QUESTION I KNOW WHEN WE HAD OUR DEBATE LAST YEAR WITH LEAD PAINT I COME FROM AN AREA THAT HAS A LARGE. INDO AMERICAN POPULATION HAS A LARGE LATINO POPULATION THEY MEASURED LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHILDREN AND FOUND IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AMOUNT OF OF LEAD. IN IN IN THE THOUGHT -- THIS MUST BE LEAD PAINT. EXPOSURE OR F. EXIDE EXPOSURE WHATEVER WHATEVER FOLKS WANT OF HIM LIVE AN EXCITING AND THEN ON FURTHER LOOK THOUGH THE MEASUREMENT WAS THEIR HIGH THEY FOUND OUT THAT -- WITHIN THE INDO COMMUNITY THURS CERAMIC PAINTING THAT IS PUT ON CHILDREN'S I LET'S AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT HAS LED IN IT THEY GIVES THAT. A KILLER INDIVIDUAL HIGH LEVEL SAME THING WITH THE THE JEWELRY WE GET FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER THAT THAT HAS A HIGH LET IN IS THIS BY -- MONITORING WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THIS PRECISE MEASUREMENT MAKE A DISTINCTION FOR THE SOURCES BECAUSE WE'RE AN AIR DISTRICT. MINOR NOT THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE OVERALL HEALTH BUT IS IT COULD GIVE YOU THAT SORT OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION SO -- YOU GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF LED OF COURSE THERE'S MANY. EXPOSURES TO LEAD MANY DIFFERENT EXPOSURES TO LEAD SO SOMETIMES BY A MONITORING ACTUALLY IDENTIFIES A PROBLEM THAT YOU NEED TO RESEARCH FURTHER AND FIND OUT THOSE SOURCES -- BUT THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF CHEMICALS WHERE WE HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD MARKERS OF AIR EXPOSURE FOR EXAMPLE DIESEL EXHAUST SO WE HAVE A STUDY. IN OAKLAND WHERE WE'RE LOOKING SEEN COMMUNITIES AND LOOK IN A PARTICULAR MEASURE OF DIESEL EXPOSURE OF A CERTAIN COMPOUND A NITRO PYRENE COMPOUND. AND WHEN YOU SEE THAT IT'S REALLY A VERY GOOD MARKER OF EXPOSURE TO DIESEL. SO IN CONSIDERING WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A MONETARY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IS. WHAT CAN WE USE AS INDICATORS OF HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE THAT WILL LINK BACK TO THE SOURCE? OKAY I'M FORMER FINANCE. WE FOR THIS BEFORE WE'RE GONNA SAY IT AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND THE AMBITION OF SIX SEVENTEEN WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WAS. THE EXTENSION OR THE FLEXIBILITY OF OF GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS REALLY DOESN'T KICK IN UNLESS WE HAVE OPTION FUNDS FROM THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE WE'RE STILL UNDER. AB THIRTY TWO AND WHILE THE TOO MANY -- MONITORING IS A GREAT IDEA IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS WHICH IS THE NEXUS BETWEEN AB THIRTY TWO A COINCIDENTALLY WE KNOW THAT IN THE LAST OPTION MAY WE DID RECEIVE SOME FUNDS. FOR AT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PERIOD TO THOSE FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATELY BEING USED FOR A. B. SIXTEEN THIS IS SOMETHING SHORT OF A BILLION DOLLARS. JUST PUTTING DOWN A MARKER TREATMENT THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT NEXUS BECAUSE AS WE GET OTHER PROGRAMS IS SORT OF MIX THINGS UP WE HAVE TO BE SURE ANY ALEJO. I'M EXPECTING A REPORT ON THAT THAT WE DON'T EXCEED THOSE -- THOSE -- LEGAL LIMITATIONS. LA -- DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD ON THE ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT SHAMMAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DIDN'T RAISE ISSUES WITH THIS PARTICULAR -- PROPOSAL -- SAID. FINANCE ANYTHING THAT. MOVES THE EERIE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HEAR AND UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGAL USE OF THAT TEACHER AFFAN LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. THIS IS THE RECOMMENDATION HOLD OPEN MEMBERS HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND I NUMBER. EIGHT ALRIGHT LET'S SAID THIS IS THE ONLY THING WITH A WE HAVE SO I'LL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS ENVIRONMENT HEALTH SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES AND AB. SIX SEVENTEEN TO HOLD OPEN ITEM. SEEN NOBODY WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THANK YOU VERY MUCH KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK -- CAL RECYCLE THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE RECYCLING AND RECOVERY [inaudible] WE HAVE. MISTER SMITH FLANK GOOD MORNING AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GIVE US AN OVERVIEW COULD YOU SORT OF GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE ON SOME OF THE PROGRAMS -- SPECIFICALLY ON THAT KEPT RECYCLING CAL RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR CPAS SPECIFICALLY WE DON'T HAVE IT'S NOT ON ONE OF THE ITEMS. BUT IT JUST GENERALLY HOW ARE WE DOING WITH A BOTTLE BILL. THE BOTTOM THE PROFESSOR OF GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS -- SCOTT SMITH LINE -- DIRECTOR COVER CYCLING JOINS MORNING BY OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAN ROSA -- SO THE BOTTLE BILL YOU WOULD LIKE A BRIEF UPDATE ON A BOTTLE BILL SIR -- YOU KNOW I HAD I TOOK AN INTEREST IN. CHANGING IT LAST YEAR LEGISLATIVE FULL WE'VE HAD A VARIETY OF OF A CONCERN WITH OUR COLLECTORS AND PEOPLE OUT I THE FIELD WE'VE PREVIOUS YEARS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE HAD. TONS OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT WE WOULD DO NEEDED MINISTRATION. WE HAD THREE YEARS OF INTEREST GROUPS AND COLLABORATIVE MEETINGS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. BUT NOTHING CAME OUT. SO WE HAVE NEW GOVERNOR NOW SO I JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE PROGRAM IN GENERAL SURE. BE HAPPY TO DO THAT AND I I GUESS I'LL START WITH YOU KNOW THE NOT SO GOOD NEWS AT THE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM IS NOT ACHIEVING. ITS 80% -- RECYCLING RATE GOAL THAT IS IN STATUTES SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PORTENTS TO US -- WE AIM TO ACHIEVE ALL THE THE GOALS AND AND THE STATUTES THAT WE IMPLEMENT -- THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT -- YOU MENTIONED ONE THAT BEEN VERY SIGNIFICAN IN A PRESS SIGNIFICANTLY LATELY WHICH IS THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF CLOSURES OF RECYCLING CENTERS -- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT CONTRIBUTE SOME TO THE REDUCE RECYCLING RATE. IT'S DIFFICULT TO TEASE OUT -- IN THIS VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAM AS YOU ARE AWARE WHAT IS DRIVING. WHAT CHANGE THAT WE SEE IN THE PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTED PURSUANT TO NEW LEGISLATION IN NUMBER OF ANTI FRAUD MEASURES WHICH WE BELIEVE? HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING FRAUD IN THE PROGRAM AND COULD HAVE. CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCED RECYCLING RIGHT THAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF REDUCING -- WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN FRAUDULENT REDEMPTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] THERE'S A GOD. ACCEPTING CERTAIN MATERIALS AS FREELY AS THEY ONCE DID. THAT ARE CONSUMED A LOT OF OUR EXPORT MATERIALS ARE NO LONGER TAKING NOTES SO THAT'S HAD. A MARGINAL IMPACT IF NOT MORE ON THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME THE RECYCLING CENTERS IN OUR ABILITY TO EXPORT THIS MATERIAL IN ADDITION PRIMARILY WE'VE SEEN. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROFIT DRIVERS OF THESE RECYCLING CENTERS REDUCED AND THAT IS -- NOT ONLY THE ALUMINUM CANS LIMóN CANTON WHERE THE PROPER DRIVERS FOR THESE RECYCLING CENTERS WE'RE SEEING IT REDUCTION IN BOTH THE VOLUME OF CONTAINERS AND ALUMINUM AS WELL AS THE SCRAP VALUE FOR LIMON HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED -- GLOBALLY -- THAT'S NOW I DID STATES A DYNAMIC. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES ND AS YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND WE ARE [inaudible] WORKING -- WORKING TOGETHER TO SORT OF DISCUSS WITH A NEW MINISTRATION AND STAKEHOLDERS THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE -- AND YOU KNOW I'D BE HAPPY TO COME IN AND PROVIDE YOU AN ADDITIONAL BRIEFING WE SHOULD BE GETTING A NEW QUARTERLY REPORT IT OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS HOPEFULLY AND THAT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING WITH THE FUND -- WHERE THE SURPLUS MAY BE HEADED AND WHAT THE CONDITION OF THE FUND IS? WHAT'S THE THAT BEFORE THE MAY REVISE PLEASE CONTINUE WITH YOUR OTHER REMARKS ON THE DEPARTMENT IN GENERAL WE HAVE TO DO -- IF SO -- OR WE CAN GO STRAIGHT TO ISSUE NUMBER. NINE I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER PREPARED REMARKS FOR THE THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL BABBY DID ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ALL RIGHT -- LA -- DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON MISSION I'M NINE THIS IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS I'M SORRY I HAVE I HAVE PREPARED REMARKS REASONABLE AND I THOUGHT YOU MEANT MORE GENERALLY FELT DEPARTMENT LET'S START WITH ISSUE NUMBER NINE OKAY. HANG ON SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SEE YOU -- REFER FREE WORK SIR LOOK I I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAD WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. AND WITHIN THE RECYCLING PROGRAM VERTICALLY IN RURAL AREAS SOME THAT WE SEEN IN FOREIGN MARKETS. HOUSE IMPACTED US SO I THINK WE'RE NOW WE'RE RUNNING ON YEARS THREE WITH -- IN RURAL CALIFORNIA LITTLE TO ZERO RECYCLING CENTER AVAILABLE. ON AND SO I I WOULD CATCH IT IS I THINK THE THE FULL OF THE FOREIGN INFLUENCES OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS OF LATE. AND ONLY EXASPERATED PROBLEM WE'VE HAD. I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL [inaudible] N.. I GUESS WHERE THE FRUSTRATION IS IN SMITH I AM NOT TRYING TO KEEP THE DOG AS WE HAVE BEEN IN MANY MANY MEETINGS TOGETHER AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN THESE MEETINGS AS WELL AS YOU WANT. TO BUT OPINION YOUR AYE -- BUT LOOK I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES. IN THE LONGER WE WAIT THE WORSE IT GETS IN NOW WORD STILLNESS WANTING THIS ONE GETS BIGGER -- AND THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT SO WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION I I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHERE WE GONNA GO FROM HERE BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL -- WE'VE -- ELEVEN WITH THIS CHALLENGE WE SAW THE HUGE LUMP WITH CHINA. ENOUGH I'D THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE -- THEN I I GUESS I CAN JUST -- WITH THE OBVIOUS WE DO NOT HAVE A B. C. P. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY ON THE BEVERAGE TEN RECYCLING PROGRAM BUT I CAN TELL YOU. THAT THE DYNAMIC WHICH YOU REYES WHICH IS -- WHATEVER THE HARDSHIPS THAT ARE FACING THE RECYCLING CENTERS THE LOW VOLUME IN THE REALISTICALLY WITH THE LOW VOLUME SITES -- FACE THAT THE WORST BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT WITH THE WAY THE STATUTE IS IMPLEMENTED IS THAT WE WE PAY RECYCLING CENTERS. ON A STATEWIDE AVERAGE. HONOR IT RIGHT AND SO -- I GUESS I CAN SURE DO THAT THAT DYNAMIC IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING AN AWARE OF AND IT'S STILL A PRIORITY FOR US SO THIS ISN'T IT IS NOT -- NOT FORGOTTEN NOT AT ALL BEING CRUNCHY -- BUT IT'S BEEN A PRIORITY WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANY SOLUTIONS TO DATE THERE BEEN A VARIETY OF ON PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BY THE LEGISLATURE -- A AND THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE -- TO GO ANYWHERE CANDIDLY THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE AN ISSUE THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION'S GONNA I'M HAVE TO TACKLE AND BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME AGAIN NOT AT ALL. IN COUNTRY TRYING TO KICK THAT DEAD DOG RIGHT BUT A LITTLE EASIER AGAIN IT IS GROUNDHOG DAY. MESSAGE RECEIVED CENTER. LET'S MOVE TO OUR CENTER MONNING. I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF SENATOR MAGUIRE'S CONCERNS. THERE WAS A JOINT HEARING YESTERDAY THAT. CHAIRMAN STERN COCHAIRED WITH -- CHAIR ALAN ON THE IMPACTS OF MARINE. IN. A LOT OF THAT. IS PLASTICS COME. IN PLASTICS THAT AREN'T BEING RECYCLED -- OR THAT. DEGRADE ASSESS AND END UP IN THESE MICROCHIPS. THE CONCLUSION OF THAT HEARING YESTERDAY THERE'S NO WAY TO RECYCLE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. WE GOTTA GO TO SOURCE POLLUTION. IN I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS. SOMETHING YOU'RE DEPARTMENT LOOKS AT SOME. BUT IF SO. RE DOING UPSTREAM TO ENCOURAGE MANUFACTURERS [inaudible] TO TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY'RE PRODUCING AND TO LOOK AT UP SENATOR. WE HAVE VERY LIMITED EXISTING STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO TAKE THAT TYPE OF ACTION -- WE HAVE A COUPLE PROGRAMS THAT DO INVOLVE SOURCE REDUCTION AS PART OF IMPLEMENTATION RIGID PLASTIC PACKAGING PROGRAM WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE AND WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THAT PROGRAM BUT IT IS FAIRLY LIMITED IN SCOPE -- BUT I AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT YOU REYES -- AND I THINK -- THAT. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECYCLE OURSELVES OUT OF THIS SITUATION I THINK THAT'S AN ACCURATE STATEMENT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT REDUCING THE AMOUNT. OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING THAT -- CONSUMED IN OUR ECONOMY AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITIES WE MOVE. FOR I APPRECIATE THAT NOW LOOK FORWARD [inaudible] TO ANYTHING EITHER. RECYCLE OR IN IN COLLABORATION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CAN DO TO RAISE THIS. ON THE ON THE SCALE OF PUBLIC AWARENESS IN CONCRETE OPTIONS IN BRINGING MANUFACTURES TO GET THERE. PARTICIPATION IN THIS IT AFFECTS EVERYBODY. SO THANK YOU. 30% STATUTORY MANDATE WOULD HAVE HELP. DIRECTOR SMITHKLINE I'VE I WOULD PRESUME MISS CENTER STERN YOU HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS ARE FRIENDS FRIEND OF THE NORTH COAST. AND WILL BE WILL BE EXPRESSING OUR THAT SENTIMENT AGAIN A I WOULD ASSUME THIS YEAR LEGISLATIVELY IT'LL COME BACK TO YOU. ON DEALING WITH THE SHORT TERM ISSUE. BECAUSE IT IS AN ISSUE. BUT YOU HAVE BIG VISION AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE NEAR TERM PROBLEMS WE GET WE GET THIS -- NATURE THAT CHALLENGE BUT I GUESS I WOULD JUST. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SIR MECHANICALLY HERE. IN THE NEAR TERM HI WHAT WHAT IS THE SORT OF PLANNING PROCESS THAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF NOT JUST. THE PRESSURE AT THE LOCAL ALL COLLECTION CENTER LEVEL BUT ALSO TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT ZONES IN SORT OF THE LACK OF CAPACITY IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT. PART OF YOUR CURRENT PLANNING FOR HOW. TO SPEND SOME OF THESE DOLLARS THIS YEAR -- I I I THINK I UNDERSTAND A QUESTION I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE CONVENIENCE OWNS AND THE THE WHEN YOU SEE DEVELOPMENTS ON SO I WERE YOUR FRIEND CONVENIENCE OWNS RIGHT WE'RE GOOD SO. THERE'S CONVENIENCE OWNS BUT THERE'S ALSO THE THE I THINK IT'S IT'S SORT OF A DEAD LETTER RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO RESURRECT THE MARKET DEVELOPMENT ZONES TO LOOKING AT SORT OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES -- YOU ARE IN THE RECYCLING MARK DEVELOPMENTS -- YEAH GRAHAM OKAY. WELL THAT PROGRAM IS -- ROBUST AND CAN BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED -- AND SO THAT PROGRAM HAS FULL SUPPORT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND I I I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S NOT A SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THAT PROGRAM AND THE BEVERAGE TEN RECYCLING PROGRAM. WELL THERE I MEAN THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP AND THAT THERE'S NO MARKET. TO AB PROCESS HELLO OKAY SERIAL YES I'M SURE TO TRY TO GET A SENSE TO JUST USE NEAR TERM STRATEGIC PLAN FOR IT FOR THE YEAR GOT IT SO WELL I SORRY FOR BEING DENTAL IT'S OKAY NO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS A LOT OF OUR GRAMS I PREACH. I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING NOW -- THE REALLY CRITICAL IMPORTANT POINT SO -- I THINK THE STATE HAS A GOOD TRACK RECORD WHEN WE SET OUR MIND TO IT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCREASE DOMESTIC RECYCLING FOR THEIR MATERIAL THAT ONE POINT IN TIME. WE USED TO EXPORT -- THAT THIS THIS WATER BOTTOM UNTIL RIGHT HERE RIGHT. THROUGH A A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO THE PLASTIC MARK DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM NOT THE ARMS YOU BUT TO A PROGRAM WITHIN THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM WE INVESTED IN. PT RECLAIMING CAPACITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE NOW CONSUME 75% OF THE PT AND READ -- PROCESS IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND EXPORT -- LESS THAN 25% OF OF THIS -- UBIQUITOUS MATERIAL HERE SO I THINK THERE'S A TRACK RECORD FOR THAT AND WE ARE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE ENTIRE MATERIAL STREAMING TRYING TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT ARE THE MATERIALS THAT ARE RIGHT. FOR CALIFORNIA TO REINVEST IN REMANUFACTURING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NUMBER OF REASONS -- NOT ALL MATERIAL TYPES MY SO MATERIAL TYPES THAT WE AND IT'S FOR RE INVESTING IN REMANUFACTURING CALIFORNIA BRING JOBS -- WHICH MATERIAL TYPES ARE PROBABLY MORE PROBLEMATIC WE WANT TO LOOK AT REDUCING OUT OF THE STREAM SO WE ARE CONDUCTING THOSE ANALYSES CHARACTERIZATION PROCESS IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW THAT'S CONTEMPLATED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE ANALYSIS AND ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED REGARDING OUR FUNDING CONDITION WHICH I KNOW CAN RISE STAR DOCUMENTS STERN CERTAINTY THAT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY GETS US. RIGHT. AND IN JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF -- EXPLANATION OF THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE DPR FUND BALANCE HAD APPROXIMATE RESERVISTS 17%. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS GOAL IS TO HAVE A RESERVE AMOUNT WITHIN 325%. IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR RESERVE WE HAD SPENT MORE THAN THE REVENUE RECEIVED CREATING A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES UNTIL WE MEET OUR 325% GOAL. AT THAT TIME DEEP YOUR WILL NEED TO EXPLORE SAVINGS CANNOT BE MADE IN ORDER TO MAKE CRITICAL NEEDS OF THE STATE WE MAY NEED TO EXPLORE THE OPTION TO RISE THE APPROPRIATE FEES. WHICH INCLUDE THE MAIL REGISTRATION AND LICENSING FEES. WITH THE NEW FINE CONDITION NUMBERS PART PROVIDED THIS WEEK DPR DOES NOT EXPECT TO REACH THAT LEVEL OF 325%. UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'LL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE. THE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE KNOW WHEN THIS CLIMATE CHANGE ENVIRONMENT THAT ONE OF THE LEAST TALKED ABOUT -- CHALLENGES PASS AND AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO HIT BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE GOT THESE INVASIVE SPECIES IN ALL THIS ACTIVITY IS GOING ON AND THE CONCERN IS THAT THE YOUR DEPARTMENT WILL BE PREPARED. WHEN THAT CALAMITY OR? SUGGEST A CALAMITY IT COMES AND THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION AND I WOULD HAVE IS IS GIVEN THE UNIQUE NATURE OF WHAT DEPARTMENT DOES IN THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE AT LAKE. I'D ASK OTHER FOLKS WHO DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON ON THAT. YET TO OCCUR. CALAMITY. RIGHT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND CERTAINLY THAT SOMETHING WE'VE CONSIDERED AT THE OFFICE WE NOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THERE COULD BE A CHANGE IN THE TYPE OF PASS WE HAVE THERE COULD BE A CHANGE IN THE NUMBERS -- IT CERTAINLY EITHER. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER -- WE LOOK AT BOTH OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH WITH THE OFFICE AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON THEN WE HAVE IN THE PAST IS THE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. WE WANT TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS PAST CONCERNS IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE MORE TOXIC PESTICIDES THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DEALING WITH. SO WE WHEN WE LOOK AT INCORPORATING THOSE OTHER MEASURES WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- RESEARCH WE'RE TRYING TO TO DEAL WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW WE CAN INCORPORATE THOSE LESS TOXIC MEASURES TO CONTROL PASSED IN THE FUTURE AND THAT CERTAINLY BEGINNING BECOME MORE NECESSARY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS WITH THE STERILE FRUIT FLY IN BT COLLINS SEVEN SOME MALATHION. SENATOR MONIC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE. THIS UPDATE. I'M ON THE HELP THE SCHOOLS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE BROAD COMMITMENT. TO INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT -- WE TALK ABOUT PASS BUT I THINK A LOT OF IN THAT BROAD CATEGORIES WEEDS AND A LOT OF THE WEED CONTROL ON SCHOOL SITES. THEY'RE USING ROUNDUP CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT ROUNDUP IS NO LONGER BEING USED AT SCHOOL SITES. NO SIR WE CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT ASSURANCE -- I THINK THAT THAT'S UP TO THE SCHOOL DO. AROUND UP IS STILL REGISTERED FOR USE IN CALIFORNIA AND AS LONG AS IT'S USED ACCORDING TO LABEL DIRECTIONS IT'S NOT PROHIBITED BUT I THINK CERTAIN SCHOOLS CAN MAKE THEIR OWN DETERMINATIONS AS TO HOW THEY WISH TO USE IT OR WHETHER IT. WAS LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SCHOOL SITES YES SIR THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN OFFERED ANY ADVICE REASON LIGHT OF RECENT SCIENTIFIC DATA SHOWING THE NEXUS BETWEEN ROUND UP AND CANCER. WE HAVE NOT PUT GLYCOSIDE INTO REEVALUATION AT THIS POINT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE COMING. ON OUR SITE IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND WE HAVE. CERTAINLY AYE AYE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN REVALUATION NOW ANY COULD BE ADDED AT SOME POINT. I APPRECIATE THAT NINE OH MY QUESTION GOES A LITTLE BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF THE BUDGET REQUEST. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S ON YOUR RADAR BUT I WOULD. JUST TING COURAGE IN LIGHT OF RECENT. PUBLIC MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT THE COURT DETERMINED -- ADVERSE HEALTH IMPACTS OF ROUND UP. AND REVIEW REALLY INTERNATIONALLY. PARTICULARLY WAS SCHOOL SITES I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE P. R. TO BE AS PROACTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND PROTECTING OUR SCHOOL SITES THANK YOU. IN A CERTAIN OVERALL QUESTION ON THE PR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ACTING DIRECTOR FOR BEING HERE -- ONE SECOND COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUE ON THE LIFE AS A FRIEND. PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS DISTINGUISHING IT AT A A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION WHAT HAPPENED THE GOVERNMENT THEY WONDER. IF THERE'S A CLASS ACTION SUIT OR SOME OTHER DECISION WHY ARE WE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO THE MORE YOU CAN DO UNDER YOUR EXISTING AUTHORITY WE DO APPRECIATE ONE OTHER. CHEMICAL AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED IBM AND YOUR EFFORTS ON INTEGRATED PES MANAGEMENT ON THIS SORT OF LOCAL DISCRETION ISSUE. DO YOU SEE -- SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY CURRENTLY TO DO MORE THAN JUST MORE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT SORT OF PUSHING ON THAT SIDE BUT ACTUALLY TAKES SOME OF THIS -- RODENTICIDE OFF THE SHELVES THAT MAYBE WE DON'T WANNA BE PUTTING IN BEHIND OUT YOU KNOW AND ARE PAID BOXES AND OTHER THINGS BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD. MULTIPLE IT IS A THERE'S ONLY A FEW MATT LINES LEFT IN ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS IS AN AMAZING APEX PREDATOR LIVES THERE AND WE LITERALLY KEEP LOSING THEM YEAR AFTER YEAR FROM FROM THIS STUFF. AND IT KEEPS IT AROUND SO YOU KNOW. IS VERY REAL AND THERE'S ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING ALTERNATIVES AND PEOPLE MAY. NOT THINK THAT. USING RAFTER POLLS ARE OTHER SORT OF NON CHEMICAL SOLUTION SOUND HIPPY DIPPY BUT IN FACT THEY'VE BEEN PROVEN IN VENTURA COUNTY TO BE PRETTY EFFECTIVE WE JUST FINISHED A CASE STUDY OUT THERE SO. I GUESS QUESTION ON LOCAL DISCRETION TO MOVE -- AND THEN WHAT KIND OF ALTERNATIVES ARE YOU LOOKING AT ON THE IBM SAID. ACTUALLY WE HAVE -- JUST RECENTLY PUT SECOND JAN ANTICOAGULANT READINESS SIDES INTO EVALUATION REEVALUATION. WE PROPOSE THAT I THINK WAS IN JANUARY WE GO THROUGH A COMMENT PERIOD AND THEN WE'VE OFFICIALLY PUT THEM INTO RE EVALUATION AT THIS POINT. SO DURING THIS TIME THEIR PERIOD THERE WILL BE NO EXPANSION OF SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANTS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WILL BEGIN AN EVALUATION OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED THE EFFECT ON ON NON TARGET ORGANISMS. THANK YOU. WITH THE ENTHUSIASM SHOWN BY MY COLLEAGUES ON SCHOOL SITES WHEN WE MOVED TO ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN WHICH IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYOR SU CHI'S BILL THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF AND THE EVALUATION OF EFFICACY OF THIS OF OF THAT. ACT. IS ARE WE ARE ARE PREPARING IT TO TO DO THAT TYPE OF EVALUATION -- ARE HEALTHY IN OUR OR ONE OF OUR BRANCHES WE HAVE A HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT -- DIVISION THAT DOES INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PROMOTION WITH SCHOOLS WE HAVE A GROUP OF FOLKS THAT GO OUT -- IN PARTICULARLY OFTEN WERE INVITED SOMETIMES E HEAR ABOUT SOME PROBLEMS SCHOOLS HAVING IT WILL CALL THEM AND ASK THEM IF THEY NEED OUR HELP WE'LL GO OUT IN A TIP TO PROVIDE THEM WITH INFORMATION ON HOW THEY CAN USE. SUBSTANCES SUBSTANCES THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE TOXIC ALTERNATIVES -- GOLFER TRAPS THAT'S BEEN A BIG THING WITH A LOT OF SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THE THE HOLES I HAVE WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT WE HAD WHEN I WAS THERE. TO WE TALK WITH ABOUT RISING UP THEIR TRASH CANS -- WE TALK ABOUT CLEANING OUT THEIR TEACHER'S LOUNGES AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT WITH OLD FOOD SOME OF THIS STUFF IS COMMON SENSE BUT SOME OF IT OR THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND. TO BE VERY HELPFUL IN DEALING WITH PAST PROBLEMS IN SCHOOLS SO WE GO OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND DO THAT NOW WITH THIS HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT -- EVALUATION WILL BE CONTACTING THE SCHOOLS TO DETERMINE. WHAT KIND OF CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE? WHERE WE ARE SEEING -- AS AN INCREASE IN THE USE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS TO REPORT BACK TO THE SENATE. COLLEAGUES THEM FROM THE CENTRAL COAST QUESTION OF RECENT INFORMATION YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE EFFICACY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTHY SCHOOL ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND IT WOULD BE. NOT BE ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WOULD SAY OH THIS IS THE HERE ARE ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN -- PRODUCED SINCE 200-022-00020 AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS AND ACTUALLY IF YOU DID USE THIS YOU HAVE A BETTER. RESULT. IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT. THE FOLKS WORKING ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS WORKING ON THAT I'M ONLY THIS IS RECOMMENDED HOLD OPEN DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT. CHAU MARTIN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE'RE NOT RAISING ISSUES WITH EITHER OF THE TWO PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU -- REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID REGULATIONS HOWEVER WE WANTED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION A LARGER ISSUE. THAT DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION THERE -- PESTICIDE REGULATION FIND WHICH IS OVER 90% OF THEIR BUDGET WE HAD NOTED THAT THE BALANCE IS SHOWN IN THE JANUARY TENTH -- BUDGET. FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES WERE DECLINING SPECIFICALLY FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FROM FOURTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION TO SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THEN ANOTHER DECLINED TO FOUR POINT THREE MILLION. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO RECEIVED AN UPDATED FIND CONDITIONS STATEMENT. THAT PAINTS A BRIGHTER PICTURE IN THIS CASE. THAT BALANCE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES TWENTY POINT SEVEN MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DECLINING TO TO THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THEN DECLINING TO GET A TEN POINT SIX MILLION. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY OPPORTUNITY GIVEN WE JUST RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION A FEW DAYS AGO TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S CAUSING THIS BUT GIVEN THAT -- THAT THAT FUND BALANCE IS DECLINING WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO HOLD THESE ITEMS OPEN AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF INTEL WE CAN LOOK INTO IT MORE. FINANCES DECLINING BUT NOT AS STEEP AS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT AND WITHIN THE 325% WILL RUN. YES LIVE VERY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AT THE TIME OF GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON ALL THE FUN USERS HAD IS CLOSED SO SINCE THEN WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECONCILE THE FIND AND PROVIDE YOUR STAFF AND THE LA OUT WITH AN UPDATED FINE CONDITION [inaudible] CENTER MONEY. MISTER CHAIR IN. AGAIN MAYBE I'M DRIFTING BACK INTO THE POLICY NO PUN INTENDED I'M CONCERNED ON THE SCHOOL SITE. MONITORING. THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS LOOKS A LOT AT PRACTICES ON SCHOOLS GROUNDS TURF IT CETERA. BUT THE OTHER BIG RISK IN RURAL AREAS IS DRIFT OF PESTICIDE FROM AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. IN MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR THERE'S PARENTS AND TEACHERS LOOKING AT CHLORPYRIFOS. WOULD THAT BE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SAFES. BEYOND -- WHAT'S CONTEMPLATED IN THE SAFE SCHOOLS. EFFORTS. IT THAT WOULD BE ON BEYOND THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACTING WAT'S CONTEMPLATED IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL HOWEVER WE DID PASS REGULATION LAST YEAR THAT DEALS WITH PESTICIDE USE AROUND SCHOOLS. AND IT HAS PROVIDED THAT -- WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF SCHOOLS -- BETWEEN SIX THE MORNING IS A SKIT AT NIGHT -- YOU PESTICIDES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DRIFT. SO THAT AT THAT WE THINK IS TAKING CARE OF A LOT OF THOSE CONCERNS -- EIGHT ALSO RESTRICTS THE APPLICATION OF HIM AGAIN -- WITHIN THIRTY SIX HOURS OF WIND CHILDREN WILL BE PRESENT AT SCHOOL AND THAT KIND OF STUFF SO WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT. THAT HAS MADE MORE OF A OF A MARKER ON PESTICIDE USE AROUND SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS. THANK YOU IN ON A LOOK FOR TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BEYOND THE BUDGET BE GLAD TO SEND YOU SOME INFORMATION ON THAT I THINK I RECALL CENTER WHEN WE HAD HEARINGS ON THAT AS PROPOSED REGULATIONS. THE DEBATE WAS HOW MUCH NOTICE THE COMMUNITY GOT WAS IT WE'RE GOING TO LAY THE PESTICIDES OUT ON SATURDAY WHEN THE SAME POPULATION IT NAMES LIVES CLOSE TO THE SCHOOLS GOING TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECT ALTHOUGH THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYBODY. ON THE SCHOOL SITE SO THAT. WAS WHAT IT WAS ALREADY WE'RE GONNA KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN FOR LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER. TWELVE ON THE INFORMATION SECURITY. TEAM AT THE PR. AND HAVE OUR PUBLIC HEARINGS. THE INFORMATION SECURITY TEAM B. C. P. IS ONE THAT WE'RE REQUESTING.

BECAUSE DURING THE MAY REVISE PROCESS WE ALWAYS DO AN UPDATE ON PROJECTED REVENUES IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND THE DEPARTMENT CAN. CORRECT ME IF I'M MISSTATING THIS BUT THEY ALSO HAVE CSU FRESNO. CONTRACTED TO PROVIDE -- PROJECTEDESTIMATES ON THE REVENUES. IN REMARKS REFRESH THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S MEMORY HOW MUCH OF THE BUDGET IN THE DEPARTMENT IS FEE BASED AND HOW MUCH IS.

THE GOVERNOR IS ALSO PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE CLEANUP OF UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PARCELS. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL ENABLE THE TSC TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CLEAN UP CREWS FROM TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PER WEEK ON AVERAGE. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON INFORMATION WE'VE GATHERED ON THE COST OF THE PROPERTIES CLEAN TO DATE HOWEVER SHOULD THESE ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES REMEDIATED WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THE TSC ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE THESE CLEANUPS BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ALTHOUGH WHETHER SCHEDULING WITH RESIDENTS HOLIDAYS AND OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THOSE TIME LINES. WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORTED DTS HE'S EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING THE EXITE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY. AND TO MEET OUR COMMITMENT TO CLEAN UP THE MOST CONTAMINATED PROPERTY IN THESE COMMUNITIES. WE UNDERSTAND THE LA OWES OFFICE HAS SUGGESTED SOME QUESTIONS AND WE ARE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE RELATED TO THE EXITE PROJECT. SO ALL ALL START OFF WITH THE FIRST QUESTION -- WINDOWS DGSE ANTICIPATE IT WILL COMPLETE THE SAMPLING OF THE TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE PARCELS WITHIN THE BE I A AND THE CLEANUP OF PARCELS CONTAMINATED BY LEAD -- THERE ARE BE I A STANDS FOR THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AREA THE PROJECT AREA. THE THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND HAN ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE PARCELS IN TOTAL -- WE HAVE AS OF MARCH FIFTEENTH OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STAFF HAS. ENGAGED WITH EACH OF THESE PARCELS I NEVER SEVEN TIMES. FROM KNOCKING ON THE DOORS TO SENDING FLYERS TO LEAVING MATERIALS ON THEIR DOORSTEPS TO WRITING LETTERS. AND WE HAVE SIMPLE EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO PARCELS. OF WE WE SWITCHED FROM STOPPED HERE. WE'VE CREATE A FUN OF A HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. YOU'VE KNOCKED ON DOORS OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN VERNON AND THEY HAPPENED WITH THE BEEN TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE. YOU'VE GOT EIGHTY FIVE HE SAID TEN THOUSAND SOMETHING AND IN EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SO YOU'VE. HAD SEVEN CONTACTS WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE BEEN UNRESPONSIVE. TO THE AGENCY ABOUT THE CLEAN UP ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED PARCELS REMAIN UNRESPONSIVE [inaudible] SO. WHAT DOES ONE DO TRESPASS ON THE PROPERTY AND PICK UP SOME SOIL? TO TO DETERMINE IF THEY'RE CONTAMINATED OR NOT OR LOOK AT THE NEIGHBORS AND SEE WHAT THIS GUY'S CONTAMINATED SHE'S CONTAMINATED. WE WE WOULDN'T THAT BE -- EASY THEN TO FINISH THE PROJECT OUT AND WE DID WE DO NEED ACCESS AGREEMENT TO A TO ENCROACH UPON ANY PROPERTY TO COLLECT EVEN COLLECTS SAMPLES. BUT WHAT WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN ACTIONS IS THAT WHEN WE SAW THAT WE WERE NOT COMMUNICATING. WITH -- WITH THAT SOME OF THE PARCELS WE LOOKED AT WHAT WHAT MIGHT BE THE REASONS. WE FOUND OUT THAT THE OWNERS ARE NOT STAYING THERE THE RESIDENTS ARE STAYING THERE SO WE CHANGED OUR AXES AGREEMENT. TO ALLOW RESIDENTS RAN TO NEXUS AGREEMENT SO WE COULD SAMPLE WE ALSO STARTED WORKING WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR THEM TO DISTRIBUTE OUR MATERIALS AND FOR THEM TO HELP US -- GET THESE HOMERS TO WORK WITH US. THE LA COUNTY HAS BEGAN WORKING IN THIS OP PROJECT AREA DOING LEAD BASED PAINT ABATEMENT -- AND WE ARE ON A MONTHLY BASIS WE ARE SHARING LISTS WITH THEM TO SAY THESE LIST THESE PARCELS STILL REMAIN. OUT OF OUR OUR PROJECT FOLD AND AND THEY ARE DISTRIBUTING SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WITH THESE. FOLKS WE ARE HOSTING MEETINGS IN THE COMMUNITIES TO ENGAGE AND EXPLAIN WHAT THE PROJECT IS ABOUT AND WHAT SAMPLING DOT. AND WE ALSO I WOULD JUST WANT TO ADD WE ALSO -- EXPECT THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO CLEAN UP AND MORE MORE PEOPLE SEE THE RESULTS OF THE CLEAN UP THAT WE MAY. BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SOME ACCESS AGREEMENTS JUST THROUGH WORD OF MOUTH AND THE VISUAL -- YOU KNOW THAT THAT. THE RESULTS OF THE CLEANUP ITSELF I MEAN I BELIEVE I WAS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN I WHEN I HADN'T OVERSIGHT HEARING. OF THE EXCISE NO I WAS IN THE SENATE IT'S FOUR YEARS AGO. THIS IS -- TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIFTEEN OKAY WE'RE GONNA PAY ATTENTION TO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS AND WE GIVE THE MONEY TO CLEAN IT UP. YOU KNOW. I'M GLAD TO HEAR TO GIVE CHANGE AGREEMENT WITH WITH RENTER'S BUT THIS IS. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA HERE. I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A BUNCH OF TIME TALKING TO PEOPLE I WANT THE MONEY TO BE SPENT TO DO TO REMEDIATE REMEDIATION I UNDERSTAND THAT FOLKS LIKE TO HAVE THINGS EXPLAINED I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CONTAMINATION OF OF LEAD AND I'M SITTING HERE. ON THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE JUST FIX IT. RIGHT IT AT SOMETIME WE GOT A STOP EXPLAINING TO EVERYBODY AND SAY WE COULD FIX IT. AT FOUR BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA FIX IT. PLEASE CONTINUE WITH YOUR REPORT. I'M SO AS AS A CHIEF NEGRI ALREADY MENTIONED. WE ARE AT WE EXPECT THAT WE'LL SEE SOME -- PEOPLE FOLD COMING TO THE FOLD WHEN THEY SEE THEIR NEIGHBOR'S YARD GETTING CLEANED OR OWNERSHIP CHANGES OR RENTER I'D CHANGES -- AND WE'LL GO AS THEY SIGN AN AXIS AGREEMENT. THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION WAS DEALING WITH THE CLEAN UPS -- EDS YES CLEAN UP SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE PARCELS -- IN THE PROJECT AREA AS OF MARCH FIFTEEN WITH TO CONTRACTORS -- CONDUCTING THESE CLEANUPS -- AS AS SHE MENTIONED EARLIER -- DDS HE WILL ALSO IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING AN ADDITIONAL CLEANUP CONTRACT. TO ADDRESS PARCELS THAT OUR PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTIES AND CERTAIN LARGER PROPERTIES -- THAT HAVE SPECIAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS -- AND DGSE ANTICIPATES THIS CONTRACT WILL BE IN PLACE IN AT THIS SUMMER. I DID YES HE ANTICIPATES THAT WITH THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- THIS THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. DGSE WILL CLEAN UP THIRTY TWO HOW I A BY DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR HUNDRED PARCELS. ARE A AND AND THE TWENTY I'M SORRY I'M GONNA SAY THIS AGAIN THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS. OF WILL CLEAN UP. OF PARCELS THAT HAVE LEAD CONTAMINATION OF REPRESENTATIVE SOIL LEAD CONTAMINATION OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PARTS PER MILLION. ARE THE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED UP PLUS PARCELS THAT WE HAVE SAMPLED. FORTY FOUR ADDITIONAL FORTY FOUR HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PARCELS ARE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE SOIL LEAD CONCENTRATIONS BELOW THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY AT THIRTY THREE PARTS PER MILLION. BUT ABOUT EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION WHICH IS DTS THESE TARGET GLEE CLEAN UP GOAL. THESE FORTY FOUR HUNDRED OUR PARCELS WILL NOT BE CLEANED UP DURING THIS PHASE THAT ARE TO BE ENDING IN DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY PUBLICLY UNIONS AND SPECIAL SPECIALLY REGULATED HOUSE SPEAKER OF SIZE OF A GROUP OF PARCELS IS THAT THERE'S HUNDRED AND FORTY PARCELS IN THAT GROUP. AND THAT CONTRACT IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THAT SORT OF ALL A CART CLEAN UP. YES IF I COULD USE THAT TERM I'M [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. FINANCE. I SEE IN. ISSUE NUMBER. FOURTEEN WE'RE ASKING FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUND FOR THE AT TOXIC SUBSTANCE ACT ALONE. AND THEN ON ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN PAYMENTS FROM THE LEAD ACID BATTERY CLEAN OF FUN OF SIXTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION -- TO PAY BACK THE THE BIG LOAN DEBT. THAT WE HAVE. I WAS BANKRUPTCY LAWYER WHERE WE BORROWING MONEY AND PAYING BACK MONEY IF WE STILL HAVE. THE IF WE ARE FOR STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE CLEAN UP. THE REMEDIATION AND IT'S A APPARENTLY GROWING [inaudible] ALTHOUGH. I WAS THE DEBTORS ATTORNEYS SO I ALWAYS LIKE TO BE PAID BACK BUT WILL. FINISH THE JOB I GUESS IS THE QUESTION. WHY IS THAT [inaudible] THERE. WHEN THE WHEN THE LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND THIS IS AN ALLOWABLE USE OF THE LEAD ACID BATTERY FUNNY SPECIFICALLY STATED IN THE STATUTORY -- LANGUAGE [inaudible] AND THAT THIS IS AGAIN ALL POINT IN TIME AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND ALSO WAS ONE ONE OF THE FUNDS THAT HADN'T BEEN [inaudible] RECONCILED. TOTALLY BETWEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND SO THAT THAT AND THAT INCLUDED THE ENTIRETY OF IT. AND THESE WERE THINGS THAT WE HAD -- PROPOSED EARLIER. SO AGAIN THESE ARE ALL THIS IS ALL PART OF GOING BACK AND LOOKING -- AND THEN COMING IN COMING IN AGAIN IN THE SPRING THREE VISIT ALL OF THIS [inaudible] JOINT [inaudible] YES. IT IS IT IS IT MY MISREADING IS ANOTHER. SIXTEEN SEVEN MILLION IN. NINETEEN TWENTY YEAH FOR AS IT AS IT IS DISPLAYED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YES THAT IS CORRECT. WE'RE PAYING BACK ONE LINE WERE ASKING FOR AN EXTENSION OF ANOTHER. ONE RIGHT WHEN WE WERE ASKING FOR DIFFERENT EDITION ALL ADDITIONAL MONEY CORRECT THIS AND THAT AND THIS SPEAKS. TO THE THE NATURE OF THE THE PROJECT ITSELF AND WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WE WANT TO ACCELERATE. WITH THE ANTICIPATION AT SOME POINT EXIDE WILL BEGIN. REIMBURSING THE STATE. OF THE LEAD ACID BATTERY ALL. IN AND OF ITSELF. IS NOT IN A POSITION TO BE DOING THESE LARGE CHUNKS -- WE COULD. I MEAN THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IF. IF THE NEW. IF THERE IS A DESIRE TO DO THE DIRECT EXPENDITURE JUST OUT OF THE LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND. BUT THEN THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY SLOW DOWN. THE THE CLEAN UP EFFORTS AND AT THIS POINT I THINK WE WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE THE KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING. FROM THE FIRST LOAN AND THEN THIS ONE WOULD. PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IS THAT IS THAT IT. IS A FUN I I THINK BECAUSE THAT WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT WAS THE FUN THAT WE TRANSFER THE FIRST BIG MONEY AND YEAH. SO WHILE WE'RE AT IT WHAT'S THE UPDATE ON THE EXCITED BANKRUPTCY. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE THE SITE IS IN BANKRUPTCY THEY SHOULD HAVE A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION I KNOW WE GOT ASSURANCES FROM THE MOTHER. EXCITED THAT THEY WOULD MAKE GOOD ON ANYTHING SHORTFALL WHAT IS THE THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT. SO THEY THEY CAME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY THEY REORGANIZED AND THEY ARE ON THEY ARE WORKING WITH US ON DOING THE ON SITE -- CORRECTIVE ACTION INVESTIGATIONS THEY'RE ALSO WORKING ON CLOSING THE FACILITY. FOR IT. I ATE THE SOUL. THERE IS NO BANKRUPTCY ON ON THE HORIZON BUT THAT. THAT IS JUST A CONCERN BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE SO THE PROCESS THAT THAT THAT WE'RE FRONTING THE MONEY FOR THE CLEAN UP THEY'RE GOING TO REPAY THIS LOAN THAT WOULD JUST BE IN IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. FOR ANY LARGE. A CORPORATION RIGHT SO WE'VE WE SUBMIT. BILLS TO THEM. ON THE ON THE STATUS OF THE THE CLEAN UP -- ON THE ON THE CLOSURE OF THE FACILITY WE DO SEND THEM INVOICES FOR THE ARE OVERSIGHT AND THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING IN IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT WORK. ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE THERE IS A PROCESS THE REASON THE STATE STEPPED IN IS THAT WE FOUND THIS IS A LARGE PROBLEM. IN FACT A LOT OF FAMILIES. AND WE STARTED THE WORK BECAUSE WORKING WITH EXCITED WILL TAKE. TEN YEARS HAD PASSED A TO GET THERE THEY HAVE SUBMITTED A REQUEST FACILITY INVESTIGATION REPORT. ODD THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING AND AND RIVER A RESPONDING TO THEM BUT THE COMMENTS. AFTER THAT THEY'LL PREPARE A CORRECTIVE MEASURES STUDY WILL SELECT THE REMEDY AND THEN THEY WILL GET TO DOING IT IN THIS% CASE WE HAVE STARTED IMPLEMENTING THE REMEDY SO WE EXPECT THEM TO PICK IT UP BUT THAT IS WAYS AWAY I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR I A C. THE RESIDENTIAL SPOTS THE ACTUAL CLEAN UP IN THE DECOMMISSIONING OF THE FACILITY THAT THEY HAVE. I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S THE BETTER QUESTION IS THERE THEY'RE TAKING APART [inaudible] THE PLACE. THE FACILITY AND DOING SOME REMEDIATION AND SOME CLEAN UP THERE TO HAVE A UPDATE ON THAT -- BECAUSE THAT'S A SOURCE OF X. BANDED CONTAMINATION RIGHT IF IT'S THERE AND IT'S SPREADING. ASSEMBLY THAT WAS THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT RIGHT SO THE FACILITY ITSELF -- WHEN THE PERMIT WAS DENIED THE SUBMITTED A CLOSURE PLAN WHICH WAS APPROVED WITH THE ACCOMPANYING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PORTS ARE? CLOSURE IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT'S ARE THE PHASE ONE IS DECONTAMINATION I DEMOLITION AND DISPOSAL. OF ALL OF THE ABOVE GROUND STRUCTURES THAT WERE USED IN HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT OUR ON SITE. ARE BEING I TAKE IN I DOWN THE THERE IS -- TWENTY TWO OUT OF THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP AS OF LAST MONTH. ARE THERE IS A OF OVERSIGHT FROM DTS SEE WE ALSO HAVE A THIRD PARTY QUALITY ASSURANCE. CONSULTANT THAT IS OVERSEEING EXIDE. EXCITE IS DOING THIS WITH THEIR OPERATIONS. THERE IS A FINAL SURE CERN'S BUT EXCITE IS DOING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CLOSURE OUT OF THEIR OPERATING FUNDS. ARE THEY ARE NOT. ALLOWED UNDER THE AGREEMENT THAT THEY HAVE REIMBURSED FOR THAT MONEY SO WE HAVE -- THAT IN PROGRESS. ASIDE FROM THE FACILITY ITSELF. THERE IS THE INVESTIGATION OF LEGACY CONTAMINATION FROM ANY ACTIVITIES ON SITE OF FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE ENTIRE BOUNDARY. ARE AND DAD INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS WE ARE THEY SUBMITTED A REQUIRE FACILITY INVESTIGATION REPORT. THE ALSO SUBMITTED A CORRECTIVE MEASURES STUDY BUT WE HAVE FOUND DATA GAPS WERE WORKING WITH THEM ON THAT. WE ASK THEM TO FOLLOW THEIR CONTAMINATION THEY WENT INTO THE NEIGHBORING INDUSTRIAL AREA. THEY HAVE INVEST. A SAMPLED ABOUT FIFTY PROPERTIES FIFTY TWO PROPERTIES THAT ARE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES ARE AND THERE ARE SOME PROPERTIES THAT REQUIRED SECOND SET OF SAMPLING. THOSE RESULTS ARE BEING REVIEWED -- THERE IS A WORK PLAN -- THAT IS BEING REVIEWED AND THERE WOULD THAT INDUSTRIAL ROUTE -- CORRECTIVE ACTION WILL ALSO GO THROUGH THE THEM SUBMITTING A FACILITY RECALL FACILITY INVESTIGATION REPORT. CORRECTIVE MEASURES STUDY AND A RE IT IS UNDER WAY AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS THE RESIDENTIAL. CORRECTIVE ACTION WHICH WE FOLLOW THE LEAD. AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TALKING BY THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FORGET AND I'M REMINDED THAT EXCITED ACTUALLY ONLY OPERATE THE SITE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. SOME OF THAT LEGACY CONTAMINATION WAS PREVIOUS OWNERS THAT OPERATE AT THAT SITE DOING. RECYCLING AND AND OTHER ACTIVITIES I KNOW I KNOW THERE THAT THE FACE TO THE PUBLIC OF ALL EVERYTHING THAT IS EVIL BUT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ONLY THERE WHEN THEY GOT THE SITE IT WAS PLENTY CONTAMINATION. IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES WERE PLENTY CONTAMINATED BEFORE THEY BECAME THE OPERATOR SO I'D. HOPEFULLY THAT'S IN YOUR BROCHURE TO THE PUBLIC AS THEY ARE. ALL MAD. YES AND WE WE WE ARE IN EVERY REPORT THAT WE PUT OUT THEY PUT OUT THEY ALSO PUT THAT IN THERE THAT THE FACILITY HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY TWO EXIDE ACQUIRED IT. TWO THOUSAND THE SECOND QUESTION THAT THE LA -- HAD FEWER WE GOT TO THE FIRST ONE YES. I'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE ANSWER TO THAT AND I I WANT TO I WANT TO JUST AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE -- STRUGGLED WITH -- COMING UP WITH A NUMBER ON THIS NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY CONTINGENCIES RELATED TO IDENTIFYING AND THE TOTAL COST OF CLEAN UP. THAT RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES BUT I'M GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A RESPONSE THAT'S BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO DATE AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE UPDATES TO THIS INFORMATION AS WE CONTINUE TO CLEAN UP AND GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SO ASSUMING THE ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION IS APPROVED -- AS AND MISS PATEL INDICATED HAVE ESTIMATED THAT ALL PARCELS OUT. MORE ABOVE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PER BE CLEANED UP USING THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION AND THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSED. THE APPROXIMATELY OF THERE'S APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES THAT HAVE BEEN SAMPLED TO DATE. THAT HAVE REPRESENTATIVE SOIL LEAD CONCENTRATIONS OF BELOW THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PARTS PER MILLION BUT ABOVE DTS SEES. EIGHTY PARTSPER MILLION TARGET CLEANUP GOAL. AND THE COST TO CLEAN UP THIS REMAINING FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR HUNDRED PARCELS ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST BECAUSE THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION IS UNKNOWN -- AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS ME CONTINUE TO INFLATE -- AS THEY HAVE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS COULD PUT ME INTO IS WE ATE WE HERE'S THE EXCITES SITE IS HERE YES YOU'VE DONE THE CLOSEST PROPERTIES NOW YOU'RE OUT I'M A MILE. POINT. SEVEN COMMON SENSE TELLS ME IT'S MAY BE WRONG BUT COMMON SENSE TELLS ME THAT THE ONE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM EXCITED IS COULD BE MORE CONTAMINATED THAN THE LAST HOUSE THAT MAY GO ABOVE. THIRTY THREE WHATEVER THAT THAT THE MEASURE OF LIES. THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PARTS PER MILLION AM I WRONG ON THAT. AS FAR AS TO SAY IF YOU IF YOU CAN GET ON TO THE PROPERTY CITY THE SAMPLING [inaudible] SO. SO YOU WERE RIGHT. YOU ANTICIPATE THAT IF YOU HAVE A SOURCE AND YOU SEE DISPERSION YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IT DIMINISHING WITH THE DISTANCE. THAT IS NOT THE CASE ODD WE HAVE LOOKED ACT WE'VE BEEN SAMPLING SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE MADE EXCITES SAMPLE THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES. IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND WE ASK THEM TO FOLLOW THE PREDOMINANT WIND DIRECTION. AND AND EVEN THEN WE FOUND IN THE CLOSEST PROPERTIES WE FOUND. DIFFERENCES IN CONCENTRATIONS NOT ONLY WE ARE FOLLOWING AERIALLY DEPOSITED LET. DO YOU WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT NOT ONLY WILL THE OUR CONCENTRATIONS DIMINISH AS YOU ALL FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO SEE LESSER CONCENTRATIONS ARE DEEPER DEPTHS. WE SAMPLE DOWN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES AND SINCE WEARING AT DIFFERENT JOBS THERE IS NO SIMPLE DISTRIBUTION THERE'S NO SIMPLE PATTERN OF DISTRIBUTION. AND THERE'S REASONS FOR IT. IT MAY HAVE BEEN CHURNED IT MAY HAVE BEEN RECONSTRUCTED RIEN TRAINED TAKEN AWAY SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WE'RE TALKING LEAD THERE ARE MANY SOURCES OF BLOOD. SO SOMEBODY COULD OF PUT IN LANDSCAPE THEIR HOUSE DECIDED TO TAKE OUT THE SOIL AND PUT THE NEW SOIL IN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY REDUCING THE LEAD THERE AND HAD KNOWN. WAS NO WISER FOR ALL RIGHT. PLEASE CONTINUE WITH. THOSE SERVICE ON MEETING THE COST GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE DIFFICULTY IN ESTIMATING THE COST IN THERE OF COURSE RELATED TO WHAT WE STARTED OUT A CONVERSATION WITH AND AND THAT IS -- ACCESS TO THE PROPERTIES THEMSELVES SO WE ANTICIPATE GETTING ADDITIONAL ACCESS AGREEMENTS TO SAMPLING CLEAN UP THE ROUGHLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT WE HAVE YET SAMPLED -- BUT WE ADDITIONALLY AND OUT OF THE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT WE'VE SAMPLE TO DATE. AGAIN -- WE CHANGED OUR OUR ACCESS AGREEMENTS TO ENABLE THE RESIDENTS. TO TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO SAMPLE BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PROPERTY OWNERS APPROVAL TO ACTUALLY DO THE CLEANUP AND SO THERE'S WE'LL CONTINUE TO IS TO GET THAT ACCESS BUT THERE IS A DELTA BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PROPERTY SAMPLED AND THOSE. THAT HAVE PROVIDED US WITH AXIS AGREEMENTS AND THAT ALL IMPACTS THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT. ARE YOU CONSIDERING PUTTING A LIEN ON THE PROPERTY FOR NOTICE. IS THAT PART OF THE THE PLAN BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT SOMETIME MY PATIENCE IS DONE AND AND JUST SAME IT'S IT'S WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT IF WE PUT A LIEN ON THE PROPERTY IN ANYBODY WHO'S GONNA CHOIR THAT PROPERTY KNOWS. WHAT A BIG RED SIGN ON THE FRONT DOOR AND SAY THIS IS POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATE WHATEVER IT IS BUT BUT? I WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES HERE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO YOU GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO DO SO TO DO THE EASY THINGS FIRST NOT THE EASY THINGS FOR THE PEOPLE SAY YEP PLEASE COME INTO MY PROPERTY I'LL SIGN OFF. WHEN DO A CLEAN UP -- OR OR YOU CAN CONTINUE TO SAMPLING THERE'S THAT SOMEBODY BODIES THAT THAT WE HAVE HERE AND AT A AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME. YOU KNOW AT LEAST IT JUST SEEMS LIKE EXTRA ORDINARY WE'RE ALREADY VISIT YOU SEVEN TIMES AND NOW WE'RE ON THE EIGHTH TIME IN A NINE TIME AT SOMETIME LET'S GO TO THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR JUST CLEAN THEIR PROPERTY BUT PLEASE CONTINUE. SO AND THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT WE WE ARE -- PRIORITIZING ARE CLEAN UP WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS THAT ARE WORKING WITH US AND WE HAVE AS WE INDICATED FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN PROPERTIES IN THE QUEUE WHERE THE PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE GRANTED US ACCESS AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM. TO TO GET THEIR PROPERTIES CLEANED UP. SO ARE AT UP ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROPERTY -- BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN PROPERTY SIZE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH ADDITIONAL MANUAL LABOR MAY BE REQUIRED TO CLEAN UP THE PROPERTY. ON THE RANGE CAN BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. FIFTY TO FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND UPWARDS OF EIGHTY THOUSAND SO OUR AVERAGE IS AROUND -- SIXTY WITH THE ABOVE DESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS AND AND STAFF OPERATING EXPENSES DTS THE ESTIMATES IT WILL COST ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO CLEAN UP THE REMAINING FORTY FOUR HUNDRED PROPERTIES BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH CLEANING UP. THE APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT HAVE YET TO BE SAMPLED. SO BASED ON OUR DATA. ABOUT SEVENTY SIX OR 77% OF THE PROPERTY SAMPLE TO DATE HAVE LEAD LEVELS ABOVE EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION. IF WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN SAMPLING AGREEMENTS FOR ALL SIXTEEN SIXTEEN HUNDRED PARCELS NOT YET SAMPLED -- AND WE ASSUME THAT 77% OF THESE PROPERTIES HAVE LEAD LEVELS ABOVE EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION. THE ADDITIONAL CLEANUP KARAKAS RELATED WITH THOSE PROPERTIES WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY NINETY MILLION FOR A TOTAL ESTIMATED COST OF THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION IF WE WERE TO CLEAN UP ALL PROPERTIES WITHIN THE P. I. A THAT TEST -- OVER THE OUR TARGET CLEANUP CALL. NOW THIS AREA HAS A LOT OF INDUSTRY AND A LOT OF-CONTAMINATION. AND I KNOW THAT IT'S POPULAR THE THING I'M EXCITED HAVE YOU LOOK AT THE SOURCE OF THESE OTHER CONTAMINATIONS IF YOU'RE FARTHER AWAY FROM EXCITE AND WE'VE GOT THIS BIG. LEAD CONTAMINATION IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE OTHER INDUSTRIES ARE THERE. ARE THERE HAVE ARE THE SOURCE OF THE CONTAMINATION WHICH IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC. QUESTION IS EASY PEASY EVERYTHING'S EXIDE BUT HAVING THEM BE THE SOURCE AND I GUESS MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PORSCHE THE PAYMENT THE PORCELAIN OF THAT CLEAN UP. THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I WANT JUST TO BE CLEAR WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AG'S OFFICE TO HOLD ALL WERE SPONSORED WILL PARTY'S ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE COST OF THE CLEANUP. LA -- YOUR SENSE I'VE FOR THOSE ANSWERS. JOHN MARTIN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A AN OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE LIKELY TOTAL COSTS OF THE SCREEN AFTER GOING TO BE FOR FUTURE BUDGET PLANNING PURPOSES. AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED THEIR BEST ESTIMATE OF THOSE COSTS AS I ADDED IN MY IT WAS -- HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROVED PLUS SEVENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION WHICH BRINGS US TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION -- INCLUDING THE CURRENT BUDGET REQUESTS AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL POTENTIALLY. THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION. WHICH WOULD BRING THE TOTAL TO SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] OVERALL. IN THE MORNING YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] WELL OUCH. LET'S TAKE THAT SIX HUNDRED FORTY UNIVERSAL NUMBER TO DO ALL THE CLEAN UP. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS AG SIDE? COMMITTED TO WERE OBLIGATED TO WE NOW [inaudible] SO. AS I X. R. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ARE WE THEY ARE THEY HAVE SUBMITTED THE FIRST REPORT IN THE PROCESS WHICH IS THE WRECKER FACILITY INVESTIGATION REPORT. I AND WE ARE REVIEWING IT WE'RE GOING TO WHERE WE'RE GOING TO COMMENT ON IT -- AND THERE IS WASTE TO GOAL BEFORE THEY THEY WRITE ANY TAX OR TELL US WHAT THEY'RE GONNA PAY. WE ARE WORKING HOWEVER WITH THE TO NOT ONLY HOLD EXCITE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND WHAT THY HAVE CONTRIBUTED BUT ALL OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THIS IS A HEAVILY INDUSTRIAL -- AREAS -- AS AS MISTER CHAIR MENTION. AND SO WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO HOLD OTHER RPGS. ACCOUNTABLE BUT THIS IS A A ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. A CONVERSATION THAT I AM. THAT THAT I CAN COUNT DISCUSS HERE BUT WE ARE GOING AFTER ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THAT'S THE MONEY SIDE -- FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH POINT AB ONE REASON THE STATE HAS STEPPED UP IS BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER PROPERTY SIXTEEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SAMPLED. OF THOSE HOW MANY. ARE NOT OCCUPIED BY THE OWNERS IN OTHER WORDS. THERE'S A RESIDENT RENTER BUT A LANDLORD WHO'S. MISSING UP IS MISSING -- IT IS IT IS A GOOD MIX IT I I DO NOT HAVE THE PERCENTAGE ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT IS A GOOD MAKES THERE ARE -- RENTER'S THERE -- THEY ARE -- BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF THEIR OWNERS THAT WAS MY QUESTION BECAUSE YOU INDICATED. YOU HAVE NOW. RESIDENTS DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ALLOW US TO SCHOOL NOW. BUT NINE THAT WHAT IS THE FEAR OF OF GOING AGAINST THE WISHES OF A LANDLORD. IS THERE ANYWAY TO THAT. WE ARE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IN LOS ANGELES COULD REQUIRED LANDLORDS. TO COMPLY FROM A PUBLIC. HEALTH POINT OF VIEW PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. SO AT SO THIS IS THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT TO YOUR MAKING A THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE WORKING WITH LA COUNTY PUBLIC A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THEY HAVE NURSES THAT GO OUT PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING TO TALK TO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES THEN DTS SEE A PERSONNEL THAT COME AND SAY WE ARE FROM THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC. I'M SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM A TWO RELATED INFORMATION TO EDUCATE THEM AND SEE IF THEY WOULD THEY WOULD SIGN AND ALLOW US ACCESS. OF BUT IN ADDITION WE ALSO WORK WITH LOCAL. GOVERNMENTS SO WE WORK WITH CITY GOVERNMENTS TO SEND OUT INFORMATION AND AND INCLUDE THAT IN EVERY CONVERSATION THEY HAVE. WE ALSO PRESENTED CITY COUNCIL SAW THE PEOPLE THAT ATTEND THOSE COUNCIL. MEETINGS WE PRESENT JUST THANK YOU MY PLAN THE EFFORT TO THE DEPARTMENT I DO -- IT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND YET IT'S TAKING YEARS AND YOUNG CHILDREN THAT ARE. PLAYING IN THOSE YARDS -- GO BACK IN REMOVE EXPOSURE IN CONTAMINATION FROM A CHILD SO. I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE IT CONTINUES TO EXPLORE WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND MAYBE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SIR ANYWAY. TO REQUIRE THE PROPERTY OWNERS APART TO PARTICIPATE. FINAL QUESTION ON THAT ANY ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY OF THESE RESIDENT FAMILIES SIR IMMIGRANT -- FAMILIES WHO MAY BE FEARFUL OF SOMEBODY KNOCKING AT THE DOOR I'M. WE HAVEN'T COLLECTED THAT SORT OF INFORMATION OF THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T. DO THAT KIND OF COLLECT DOESN'T THAT KIND OF INFORMATION BUT I I CAN SAY THIS THAT ALL OF MY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STAFF THAT ARE DEDICATED TO THIS PROJECT. ARE BILINGUAL AND THEY USE THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE ALL THE TIME. THANKS ANNA I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES WE REPRESENT. THEY OFFER EXPLICIT. REASSURANCES TO FAMILIES WHO MIGHT COOPERATE IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THAT THERE WON'T BE AN IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES AND I DON'T KNOW IF. THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- TOOL THAT COULD ALSO. REDUCE CONCERN OR FEAR ABOUT GRANTING -- THESE PERMISSIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. TOO MUCH FOR THE CHURCH ONE A A WALK THE NUMBERS IN THE MATH ONE MORE TIME AND THEN HAVE SOME QUESTIONS -- FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WELL TO SAY THAT'S BROWN. ONE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING AT ANOTHER. OVER FOUR THOUSAND AFTER CORRECT THAT WOULD BE ROUND TWO GREATEST SO. THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS CAN YOU GIVE US ONE MORE TIME THE OVERALL. ANTICIPATED COSTS UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT IN EXACT BUT WHAT THE ANTICIPATED SO THAT THE THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS WILL BE CLEANED UP WITH THE ORIGINAL HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. BEFORE YOU FOR CONSIDERATION WHICH INCLUDE TWENTY FOUR POINT. FIVE MILLION AND AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A TOTAL OF SEVENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR UP TO THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES. DISTANCE SO QUICK MANNER. FIFTY ONE MILLION. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION [inaudible] RIGHT [inaudible] ONE SECOND AND THEN THE OTHER. FOR FORTY TWO HUNDRED YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK ON THE OTHER THE ADDITIONAL FORTY FOUR HUNDRED I PROVIDED A ROUGH ESTIMATE. OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. BASED ON AN AVERAGE COST PER PROPERTY OF SIXTY MILLION PLUS OPERATING EXPENSES AND AN OVERSIGHT CONTRACTOR. ARE WE SEEN. THEIR PRICE PER PARCEL GO UP ARE WE SEEN IT HOLDING STEADY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GIVE US A RANGE. OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY EIGHT UP TO EIGHTY DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY I WOULD ASSUME. IN THIS. HAS THAT BEEN HOLDING STEADY CAN YOU GIVE SERVE DAY I CAN I CAN TALK TO THAT -- SO. THE COST AT THE WHEN WE SAY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER PARCEL IS AN AVERAGE IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE PARCEL THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PARCEL AND THE DEATH BECAUSE WE HAVE SAMPLED ALL THESE PROPERTIES A SERVICE. FOLLOWING THE AERIAL LEAD WE WANTED TO GET IT DONE. AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. SO WE WE HAVE PRIORITIZE ON THE SURFACE CONCENTRATIONS BUT WHEN WE CLEAN UP WE GO DOWN TO TWELVE OR EIGHTEEN INCHES STEP. WE DON'T KNOW THAT CONCENTRATION UNTIL WE GET THERE. OUGHT SO THE TOOL THAT IT'S DEPENDENT ON THAT IT ALSO IS DEPENDENT ON SOMETIMES CAESAR'S MOPED PROPERTIES THESE PROPERTIES ARE LAID OUT IN SUCH A VERY COMPLEX CANNOT GO WITH EQUIPMENT -- BUT MY MOM HAS IT FROM WHERE ARE REGIONAL ESTIMATES WERE. TO WHERE THEY'RE AT NOW. HOUSE OF PLANO YEAH AND AND LET ME JUST SAY THEY HAVE INCREASED SOMEWHAT THE ORIGINAL COST ESTIMATE THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS BASED ON PROPERTIES THAT EXCITE CLEANED UP. THEY HAD DIFFERENT CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATE HOUSE -- THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION WAS DIFFERENT AT THAT TIME AND WE HAD OTHER -- THINGS THAT ATTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED COST PER PER PROPERTY SO THEY HAVE GONE UP -- OUR OUR ESTIMATE THIS POINT OF SIXTY IS AN AVERAGE AS MISS PATEL INDICATED AND YOU KNOW -- YOU ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW IT IT'S GOING TO TAKE US UNTIL DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TO CLEAN UP THE UP TO THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE FORTY FOUR HUNDRED PROPERTIES WE WOULD NEED TO REVISE THAT ESTIMATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AT THAT. TIME BUT WE WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT ESTIMATE TO YOU AND TO THE LA -- ON BASED ON THE LINE OF QUESTIONS MORE INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH. OBVIOUSLY THE TOP PRIORITY IS THE SAFETY OF NEIGHBORS -- A AND CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE LIVING IN A HOME RIGHT THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP LIKE THIS -- AND BUT ALSO WALKING THROUGH HOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT COSTS. IN THE MANAGEMENT AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS AS FAR AS WHAT THE BUDGET LOOKS LIKE. THIS IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE -- AN IDEA OF WHERE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO DEPENDING ON A LOT. WHETHER IT'S SLOPED FLAT -- IF IT'S HOW DEEP THE CONTAMINATION IS. SO WHATWHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS FAR AS TRYING TO MANAGE THAT BUDGET JUST. BECAUSE IT'S IT IS SO FLUID. YES. I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION AND IT IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING -- GIVEN. ALL OF THE OTHER -- CHALLENGES THAT THAT DTS HE HAS HAD. ON THIS PROJECT. WE'VE BEEN TRACKING IT CLOSELY WITH. WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND WHICH IS WHY WE'VE GOTTEN THAT. EXCUSE ME THE AUTHORITY IN THE FOR THE ABILITY. TO AYLER IT AND WE WOULD BE COMING BACK IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN IF IF THE COST TO GO UP -- WE ARE AGAIN WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON WHY WE BUILT IN ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION WE ARE CONCENTRATING ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE RESIDENTS -- WE DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THEIR HEALTH BECAUSE OF THE BUREAUCRACY GOING ON WITH FINDING THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND ACTUALLY GETTING BACK FUNDING BACK FROM THEM WHICH IS WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IS A LOAN. AND THERE IS ALSO -- MY BELIEVE LANGUAGE IN THE ORIGINAL. THE ORIGINAL APPROPRIATION. THAT -- THAT THAT STATES [inaudible] THAT. IF NO RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE. AVAILABLE THEN THAN IT IS A STATE RESPONSIBILITY. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT REALLY FULLY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. I GUESS WHAT I'M I'M SURE LOOK AT ANYA GIVEN EXAMPLE SO -- WHERE I COME FROM THE COUNTY CINEMA -- JAPANESE DECLARED ON A CREEK THAT -- BRINGS WATER DOWN FROM WARM SPRINGS DAM TO THE RUSSIAN RIVER. I IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ENDANGERED COHO HABITAT IN IT WE ARE HAVING WE ARE BEING FORCED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHTFULLY SO TO BE A GREAT AUSTRIAN HABITAT. I BRING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE IN WHAT OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES WERE TO BE TO DEVELOP WATER PER MILE COSTA DE DEVELOP AT POSTURING HABITAT. WAS A LOT LOWER TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A VERY SMALL DIVISION WITHIN THE AGENCY THAT IS MANAGING IT THE SOLELY FOCUSED ON WHAT THE BUDGET LOOKS LIKE AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTAIN -- THE INCREASED COSTS -- COMPLICATED CHALLENGES IN REGARDS TO LAND DEAL LANDOWNERS AND CANDIDLY ON LABOR AS WELL RIGHT. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT WHAT IS THAT WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BECAUSE THIS THIS HAS IN A POTENTIAL. I CANNOT IMAGINE THIS IS GOING TO GO DOWN THIS IS ONLY GONNA GO UP SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT MECHANISMS ARE ARE. TRYING TO BE A STAND TOP OF WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ONLY GONNA GROW I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. THAT'S TRUE AND THAT'S WHY THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS THAT THAT FINANCE HAS BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH. WITH DTS SEE NOT JUST ON THIS PROJECT BUT HOLISTIC -- YEAH ABSOLUTELY NO THANK YOU AND AGAIN OUR TOP PRIORITY OBVIOUSLY IS ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE MY LAST QUESTION -- IT TO FULL NUMBER -- ONE AS OF IN ANY THOUGHT OF HIRING A NONPROFIT. SO WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS IN CINEMA CANYONS PROJECT. NO ONE WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO COME SIT DOWN WITH HIM IN THE KITCHEN IN TOWN THAT WE ARE GOING. TO BE CLEANING UP THE PROPERTY BECAUSE WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY BLINDERS ON WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT WHAT IS THEIR RIGHT AND NOTHING ELSE. I IN WHAT IS HELP TO SIGNIFICANTLY IS BRINGING ON A NON PROFIT. TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH US THE CONVERSATION NEIGHBORS TO BE A TO GET THE ACCESS LIABILITY. AGAIN THE OFFENSE BUT DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE STATE RIGHT SO. CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THE YES IS SO WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH A LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- THE IN IN CANVASSING I EAST YARDS -- COMMUNITIES. DONE THAT WE ALSO HAVE INITIATED WHICH WAS REQUIRED UNDER AB ONE ONE EIGHT IS. TO DEVELOP THE WORKS PROGRAM WHICH IS. A TRAINING LOCAL. COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION WORK AND THOSE PEOPLE THAT GO UNDER THOSE GRADUATES OF THAT WORKS PROGRAM ARE ALSO EMPLOYED AND THEY ARE LOCAL. THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT THAT THAT THAT THE STATE HAS AGREED UPON HAS TARGETED HIRING PROGRAM AND IT HIRES ALL OF THE LOCALS. THAT IS HELPING US. WITH THAT SORT OF FIVE EIGHT REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THESE PEOPLE AND HAVE YOU SEEN AN UPTICK OF INDIVIDUALS WILLING TO BE ABLE. TO GET INTO THE PROGRAM YES THIS EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED UP BOB PROPERTIES THAT WE SAMPLED IN A TIME SPAN OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT THAT DIRECTLY SPEAKS TO ALL OF THAT. IN MY LAST QUESTION IS -- HAS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BEEN DECLARED IN THAT AREA BY THE COUNTY AS THERE ARE VAST POWERS THAT. A GOVERNMENT HAVE -- WHEN THERE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECLARED AND THAT THE CHAIR BUT IT UP TALK FOR THE LA -- ABOUT THIS EARLIER IS IF WE HAVE FOLKS WERE NOT COOPERATIVE I GET IT IT'S THE LAST RESORT BUT PUTTING A LIEN ON THE PROPERTY SO CAN YOU. SO I I I I AM NOT. AWARE OF COUNTY DISC -- DECLARING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY -- I KNOW THAT THEY ARE. JERRY ARE WORKING ON LEAD BASED PAINT ABATEMENT ARE AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM -- AND ON THE LEAN IT I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE -- TO GO BACK BUT I I THERE IS NO OF PRESIDENT IN THE STATE ARE DOING A LIEN AGAINST A PROPERTY BUT I WILL HAVE I WILL TAKE THAT HOME AND I WILL DISCUSS IT WITH THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT. YET AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AGAIN WHEN WHEN YOU TO CLEAR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THERE'S BASS POWERS SAID. LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS I JUST DON'T FROM OUR FLOODING I DAYS OF WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS CAN ACTUALLY GET ON TO PRIVATE PROPERTY SAID DR -- AND ASSIST HOMEOWNERS -- EVEN IF THEY LIKE IT OR NOT CAN I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW UP AND PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION AFTER DISCUSSION WITH OUR LEGAL BECAUSE WE DO PROVIDE THE SAMPLING RESULTS TO THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND SO. THE QUESTION OPPOSED TO THEM IS WHAT IS THE TO DISCLOSE UPON SALE OF THE PROPERTY AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING. THE VIEW TO ALLOW ME TO IS TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON A PROVIDING A RESPONSE LOOK FOR TO THAT THANK YOU I THINK WE'VE LEARNED WITH THE FIRE PROBLEMS AT THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT A LIEN ON IT. THERE MAY BE. ACTION THE AMONG SAYS TO TO GIVE THE STATE THAT AUTHORITY IF THEY DO DO THE CLEAN UP TO PUT TO GET THE REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE PROPERTY OWNER -- GIVEN THE ESTIMATES BECAUSE I DON'T. WE DIDN'T HAVE AB ONE ONE EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT TALKED ABOUT THE JOBS PROGRAM TRAININGS PROGRAM I DON'T THINK WE ESTIMATED OR ANTICIPATED TO RE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT ON THE CLEAN UP ON THIS SITE. WHAT'S THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT THAT HAS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S WONDERFUL THE TRAIN LOCAL PEOPLE BUT BUT THAT HAS A CAUGHT AN ADDITIONAL COST IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH. CRISIS OF PEOPLE OR THE USING THAT WORD TO JUST GET PEOPLE THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO COME IN AND DO THE REMEDIATION DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA. AND AND WHAT THAT ADDITIONAL COST WOULD BE GOING FORWARD. I MEAN I I I GET DID IT BENEFITS PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND NOT BUT I DID THE DOES IS NOT FREE. SO THE WORKS PROGRAM ITSELF HAS NOT -- IT I I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS FOR WHAT THE WORKS PROGRAM HAS COST TO DATE. I IT IS IT IS IN THE LOW MILLION. TO A MILLION AND HALF -- BUT I I THE REASON I HAVEN'T QUANTIFIED THAT IS TO ME THE VALUE OF HAVING THE WORKS PROGRAM IS IS ENORMOUS. AS YOU NOW HAVE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AS YOUR PARTNERS ON THE PROJECT THEY TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE PROJECT AND THEY ARE WORKING ON IT. I AND WE ARE SEEING THAT IF I MAY THERE IS AN EXAMPLE THAT I WON I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY -- OF THEIR RESIDENT WAS GETTING CLEANED UP. AND THE DECIDED TO BUY LUNCH. FOR ALL OF THE WORKERS ON SITE INCLUDING DTS THE STAFF THAT WAS OVERSEEING. THIS IS THIS IS THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WE ARE BUILDING WITH THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING ON THE SITE. I AND SO THAT IS A TREMENDOUS VALUE AND ANDI JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THAT THE ARE GRADUATING WITH -- SKILLS THAT WILL ENABLE SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT IN THE FUTURE NOT JUST WITH SKILLS THAT ARE PARTICUAR AND SPECIFIC TO THIS PROJECT I JUST NEEDED THE QUANTIFICATION. WE'RE AN ORAL I GUESS WE WILL BE AND SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILLION LARGE ONE MILLION DOESN'T ROCK MY BOAT I JUST. PROPORTIONALITY ALRIGHT LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ITEMS NUMBER. THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN ROOMS OF THE PUBLIC DEBT. HAVE A DIFFERENT OBSERVATION OR DISAGREE WITH SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN SAID. I IN THE ROSTRUM OF THE SAN ANDREAS POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND I WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT WE SUPPORT -- HAVING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO DO A FULL CLEAN UP OF THE EXIDE. SITE HOWEVER -- WE HAVE TO BE VERY CONCERNED -- ABOUT THE MANY APPS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY HAPPENING -- DGSE ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY TEN THOUSAND CONTAMINATED SITES ARE IN CALIFORNIA MANY OF WHICH I HAVE NOT YET BEEN DISCOVERED INVESTIGATED OR CHARACTERIZED. MANY OF THESE WILL NOT HAVE A RESPONSIBLE PARTY. AS I THINK WE HEARD AT THE OUTSET OF THIS HEARING THERE IS A LARGE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN BOTH OF THE ACCOUNTS THAT FUNDS DTS. AND FRANKLY I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT EVEN OF THE SITES THAT ARE KNOWN. THAT WE ARE NOT FUNDING ANY CLEANUP ACTIVITIES OR CHARACTERIZATION OR INVESTIGATION. I WILL I WANT TO CALL OUT FOR EXAMPLE. IN OAKLAND. THERE IS A SITE. AGAIN IN AN URBAN AREA WITH MIXED RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL WHERE T. C. E. IS KNOWN. TO BE AT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND TIMES SAFE LEVELS IN THE IN THE IN THE GROUND WATER. AND SOIL GAS THERE IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES THE SAFE LEVEL. THE SOIL IS CONTAMINATED WITH CADMIUM LEAD AND NICKEL AND LEAD THERE IS A HUNDRED TIMES THE SCREENING LEVELS. THIS SITE IS ON THE THIRD PRIORITY LIST AND I KNOW FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THERE HAS BEEN NO MONEY BUDGETED FOR ANY ACTIVITY AT THIS STE. THERE ARE OTHERS IN RICHMOND IN -- DELAY KNOW WHERE OUR OFFICE IS LOCATED -- THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING ANY FUNDS SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IT TAKES TO CLEAN UP EXIDE. WE WOULD BE NAIVE TO THINK THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY HUNDREDS OF OTHER SITES IN CALIFORNIA. ARE THERE PROBABLY REQUIRE THE SAME LEVEL OF INVESTMENT THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN DISCOVERED YET. AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY DISCOVER THE SITES WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE CURRENTLY ARE A PUBLIC RISK WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING OUR HEADS. IN THE SAND AND WE'VE BEEN KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FOR TOO MANY YEARS AND I HAVE NOT HEARD AND HAVE. YET TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS BUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THE LONG TERM IMPACT ON THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE FACING TODAY SO. I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE TNC THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY FIXING THE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT FOR THE CLEANUP FIND THAT TODAY IS IS CURRENTLY HURTING PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. POINT TAKEN MAX. GOOD MORNING. ALMOST AFTERNOON SENATOR ACCOUNTS CAN COMMUNITY AT COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHARLENE CONTROLLERS AND I WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR INCLUDING IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS CLEANING UP RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES SURROUNDING THE FORMER EXIDE. FACILITY IN WE ARE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. I IT'S ESTIMATED AS WE HEARD HERE AT THAT THE COST FOR THE CLEANUP IS OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IS ANOTHER KEY STEP IN ASSURING THAT WE HAVE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAM. ARE AVAILABLE AND TO CLEAN UP WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NEW AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP. AND OUR ENCOURAGE WITH THEIR DESIRE TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTY AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS IN ADDRESSING THE LONG STANDING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CLEAN UP. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS COLLABORATION AND STAND READY TO ASSIST THE AGENCY AND THE LEGISLATURE AND RISK AND ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANNEX. HELLO MY NAME AMERICA SOME OF THEM WITH THE SAN ANDREAS PARTING THE ENVIRONMENT LAST MONTH IN FRONT OF YOU -- I SPOKE SPANISH AND I'LL MAKE SOME MORE COMMENTS BEEN AND SPANISH AND THAT AS HE TO SEE GOES THROUGH ITS -- PHASES AND LEARNS HOW TO MANAGE ITS MONEY THAT IT ADEQUATELY. PUTS RESOURCE TO OUR REGION TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED BUT DON'T GET ADVOCATE RESEARCH. SEES ME OUT REACH -- AND THAT'S CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT CITY OF INDUSTRY AS ONE WITH THE COME ECHO. SITE AND ALSO -- ALCOHOL AND THAT ALSO HAS T. C. HOW THAT THAT AND HOPE THE DEPARTMENT LEARNS TO INVEST NOT JUST IN THE CLEAN UP BUT ALSO AN APPROPRIATE CULTURALLY COMPETENT CONSISTENT OUTREACH THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH LET'S CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THE SIR ITEMS AT THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN WE WILL HOLD THEM OPEN THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION -- LET'S MOVE TO ITEM. WE HAVE TO DO A LITTLE VIGNETTE HERE FOR A COUPLE OF ITEMS THIS IS ITEM FIFTEEN LET'S GET THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO TALK ABOUT INCREASE DRINKING WATER LABORATORY SERVICES. THIS IS FOR POSITIONS EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET YEAR AND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CONTINUING [inaudible] APPROPRIATIONS [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. OR STILL. GOOD MORNING. PLEASE WARNING SO I MUD DURAFLAME IS I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION DRINKING WATER TO STATE WATER BOARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT ISSUE FIFTEEN AND WITH VISA. OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. EILEEN SO BACK WE'RE GONNA BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE IS AS WE GO THROUGH -- SO. SO SHOULD FIFTEEN AND I SHOULD MENTION AS WELL WE HAVE A PAGE IN A A NEARBY IF ANY QUESTIONS FORM SO. ALL ALL TO ATTEMPT TO COVER THIS FROM THE BEGINNING HERE. SO THIS ISSUE IS REQUESTING A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND AND ON GOING AUTHORITY. OF FOR OUR DRINKING WATER RADIATION LABORATORY AT C. P. H. WHEN DRINKING WATER PROGRAM WAS MOVED TO THE STATE WATER BOARD THE DRINKING WATER RADIATION LABORATORY REMAINS OUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- WE FUND THAT THROUGH A CONTRACT WITH THEM THE INCREASE SOME OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE FOR US. PRIMARILY WE'RE ASKING TO OF FIRST. UPGRADE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET WHAT'S CALLED T. AND I IT'S A NATIONAL STANDARD ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUALITY OF WORK TO DO SO WE WANT. THEM. TO BE ABLE TO MEET THAT STANDARD WERE ALSO. ASKING THAT DAY INCREASE IN ADD ADDITIONAL. METHODS TEST METHODS AND KICK OF MATERIALS TO BE TESTED UNDER THE DRINKING WATER. AXE SO THAT THEY CAN DO THOSE THE THE SECOND WATER ACT REQUIRES THAT WE HAVE A LABORATORY CONTRACT TO THE STATE THAT CAN DO ALL. NCL'S LISTED. OUR THROUGH OUR WORK WITH THEM OVER THE COUPLE YEARS WE REALIZE THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THOSE SO THAT WE'RE ADDING FIFTY ONE ADDITIONAL CONSTITUENTS AND TWENTY FIVE NEW ANALYTICAL METHODS OF THE COSTS ARE INCREASED. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND OF COURSE THERE ARE REFERENCE LABORATORY THEY DO A LOT OF WORK FORCE ON REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE. OF THE MICRO PLASTIC ONE WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER AND P. FAST PEOPLE -- AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF COMING ALONG SO IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE SURE THEY HAVE. ENOUGH CAPACITY TO HANDLE THAT YPE OF WORK AND THAT'S IT PUBLIC HEALTH [inaudible] IF. TELL ME. WHERE IS THIS LAB LOCATED I KNOW IT'S IN THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HELP BUT IS IT LIKE RIGHT OVER HERE ON FIFTEEN STREET THOUGH IT'S IN THE RICHMOND? BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND WE WERE GOING THROUGH A PROCESS WERE WERE -- BUILDING A NEW NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY RIGHT AND IS AND WE HAVE SO THE IDEA WOULD GET THIS. COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT IS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD AT SOMETIME GOING TO BE BUILDING. IN BUILDING NEW STRUCTURES IS THE IS THE BIG PLAN HERE DO YOU GET A BILL THE LAB OR WE JUST GONNA. USE THE PARTNER PUBLIC HEALTH. THE INTENT IS THE LEAD USED APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH OR CERTAINLY OTHER LABS WITHIN THE STATE AS WELL THAT IF WE NEED TO MOVE AROUND WE COULD. DO THAT THE WATER BOARD THIS TIME DOES NOT INTEND TO CONSTRUCT LEVEL THAT'S ON THERE'S ENOUGH CAPACITY ENOUGH SHARING IT JUST BY A QUICK UPDATE TO QUIP IN AND DO LIKE THAT. CORRECT OKAY I'M LA -- YOU HAVE A COMMENT. FINANCES THAT THAT THIS IS A SIX BUDGET IT. THE PUBLIC COMMENT OUR MEMBERS. INTERESTED INCREASED DRINKING WATER LABORATORY SERVICES. CAROLINE A CHAIN A MOTIONLESS CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING WILL JUST HAVE MOTION BY. UNDER MCGUIRE TO PROVE THE RE REQUEST. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASKING HI IN [inaudible] MCGUIRE [inaudible] MONNING [inaudible] DURING. KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBERS -- AND THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU PUBLIC HEALTH N. [inaudible] ALL UP. CONTINUE WITH STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD ON HE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICERS. AS PRODUCT OF AB. SEVEN FORTY SEVEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR I THINK IT'S AFTERNOON NOW I'M EILEEN SUBJECT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF STATE WATER BOARD -- AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE -- SO LET ME -- SPEAK -- AS YOU SAID -- TO THIS THIS ITEM WHICH WOULD FUND -- AND THE STAND UP OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICE IN THE STATE WATER BOARD. BUT WE ARE REQUESTING TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. OF FUNDED IN PART BY THE WATER RIGHTS FUNDS THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND THE GENERAL FUND. FOR THE REMAINDER FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION FOR THE SUPPORT OF NINE PERMANENT POSITIONS -- TO ESTABLISH -- AND OFFICE WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORTING STAFF. TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS AND WATER RIGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND WHO -- PREPARE DECISIONS IN THOSE IN THOSE MATTERS. THAT REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR CONTRACTED ECONOMIC EXPERTISE. THE STATE WATER BOARD. ANTICIPATES PROSECUTING MORE WATER RIGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IN THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY NINETEEN THROUGH TWENTY AND OUT YEARS. DUE DUE TO RECENT WATER RIGHT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND NEW CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY -- AND ALSO WE EXPECT -- IT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM AND THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT MAY ALSO RESULT IN MORE HEARING REQUEST IN COMING YEARS -- AB THREE THIRTEEN SPONSORED BY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS THAT'S VETOED BY THEN GOVERNOR BROWN -- HOWEVER IN HIS VETO MESSAGE -- GOVERNOR BROWN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE BILL. IT COULD KNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IN THAT BILL TO INCREASE FAIRNESS AND AND TRANSPARENCY EVEN THOUGH HE CONCLUDED THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT WORK AS INTENDED. ON THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE DIRECTED THE SECRETARY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY TO EVALUATE. THE POTENTIAL ROLE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AND PROVIDE A RECOMMENDATION FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BOARDS HEARING PROCESS -- AND THE SECRETARY'S RECOMMENDATION WHICH CAME OUT OF THAT CALLED ST OF HEARINGS OFFICE AS A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT OF THE STATE WATER BOARD. AHMED AND THE PURPOSE WAS TO PROVIDE QUALIFIED IMPART IMPARTIAL HEARING OFFICERS IN WATER RIGHT ENFORCEMENT MATTERS. SO -- DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING -- COMPETING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BOARD MEMBER AND STAFF TIME AND WE RECOGNIZE THERE IS A BACKLOG ON PROCESSING HEARING REQUEST AND THAT THERE CAN BE LONG DELAYS BETWEEN. SUBMISSION OF HEARING REQUEST IN THE ACTUAL HEARING AND THEN ADDITIONAL DELAYS BETWEEN THE HEARING -- WHEN IT IS HELD AND RELEASE OF A PROPOSED DECISIONS AND HAVING HEARINGS BY HELP BY HEARING OFFICERS AND -- DRAFT DECISIONS -- PROPOSED -- PREPARED BY THOSE -- HEARING OFFICERS. WE BELIEVE WILL IMPROVE THE PROCESS IF ADEQUATE FUNDING IS. PROVIDED TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL -- AND THE ON WATER RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT IN FACT AND THE OFFICE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HEAR AN EXPEDITE OTHER WATER RIGHT -- PROCEEDINGS -- INCLUDE AFTER -- THEY FULFILL THEIR ENFORCEMENT AND HEARING OBLIGATIONS SO WE COULD -- REAM REDUCE. BACKLOGS IN OTHER OF OUR AND OUR OFFICES. THE 25% OF THE REQUESTED -- FUNDS ARE FROM THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE SOME HEARINGS WILL INVOLVE ENFORCEMENT AGAINST PERSONS WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO WATER RIGHT FEES. OF BY VIRTUE OF AN EXISTING LAW THAT -- WHERE THEY ARE DIVERTING UNDER RIPARIAN ARE PRE -- FOURTEEN APPROPRIATE IF RIGHTS SO -- AT THIS POINT WE'RE WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT THAT WOULD -- THAT THAT WILL INVOLVE THAT 25% OF THE TIME OF THE OFFICE WE WILL ADJUST THAT IF WE ACTUALLY GET THE OFFICE AND WE ASSESS THE CASELOAD. SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS MATTER I KNOW SOME OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE GREAT BILL ON THE COVER HERE WE ALL. WERE -- VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE IMPARTIALITY ABOUT THIS. THESE ARE THE SPEECH CAN BE. COMPLETED I GUESS NOW THAT WE HAVE TO PAY THE BILL SOME FOLKS OF RAISE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE COST -- THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE FUND NOT TO BUT THE GENERAL FUND PORTION OF IT THAT'S OKAY BUT THE FUN CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT -- OF THE SECTION PERHAPS SAID IT SAYS [inaudible] QUITE EXPENSIVE. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW. HOW MANY HEARING OFFICERS WERE OR NINE I GUESS WE'RE GONNA GET? IT WOULD BE NINE POSITIONS THE IDEA WOULD BE TO HAVE THREE HEARING OFFICERS -- AND I AM WE CAN RESPOND IN IN -- MORE DETAIL LATER BUT I I THINK THRE ARE SOME MISCONCEPTIONS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OF OF FEES I WOULD BE NECESSARY AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE AN AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE AN INCREASE IN FEES NECESSARY TO COVER ON THE COST OF THIS OFFICE. AND IF SO WHAT PERCENTAGE -- INCREASE THERE WOULD BE AND THERE HAS BEEN IN IN -- SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE AN ESTIMATED OF THAT OR OR OR INTERPRETED OUR DISCUSSIONS WHICH ARE NOT -- WE WE HAVE THE I AM A COMING YEAR YET WE'RE STILL HAVING STAKEHOLDER OUT REACH MEETINGS BUT THE SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT WE WERE WE ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE OUR WATER RIGHT FEES BY 15%. AND WE DON'T WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT. UP WE'VE WE BELIEVE THAT -- IT IT. IT'S LITTLE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABOUT 7% -- THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE THE IT IT WILL M.. PART PARTS OF THE INCREASE WILL COME OUT AT PARTS OF THE INCREASE OF OUR PROPOSED INCREASES IN FEES ARE GOING TO GO. TO OTHER ASPECTS OF INCREASED -- COST NOT. TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICER WE HAVE OTHER. WE HAVE OTHER. STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WHICH WILL BEAR THE BURDEN OF THE INCREASE OF THOSE FEES THOSE OTHER FEES IF THEY DO COME TO PASS -- ANOTHER -- I THINK IT'S A CAPTION OR YOU KNOW MISS OF MISUNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO CLEAR UP IS THAT SOMEHOW -- SINCE WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT -- SOME -- SOME OF THE CASES HANDLED BY THIS OFFICE WILL INVOLVE -- WATER RATES FOR CANNABIS -- OPERATIONS -- AND THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER WATER RIGHT -- FEE PAYERS ARE GOING TO BE BEARING THE THE BURDEN OF THOSE MATTERS. IN FACT FOR THE WATER RIGHT -- ISSUES THE CANNABIS OPERATORS DO PAY FEES THEY'RE ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE FEES FOR OTHER -- WATER RIGHT AND STAKEHOLDERS -- AND ALSO INCLUDE IF THERE ARE FOURTEEN AND AND RIPARIAN USERS AS WELL SO -- IN ARGUE THEY WILL BE BEARING THE CANOPY TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CANNABIS CASES THEY WILL BE BEARING THE COST -- IT WILL NOT BE OF THOSE CASES OUT OF THEIR FIFTY PORTION AND WE WILL -- TAKE A LOOK AT THE CASE LOAD OF THE OFFICE OF ITS ESTABLISH FROM YOU KNOW AND ON ANNUAL BASIS AND SEE WHAT THE CASE BREAKDOWN IS AN ADJUSTER FEES ACCORDINGLY SO THAT'S I THINK. THANK YOU FROM OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND AND THEN IF I'M IF I MIGHT JUST BE ANOTHER ISSUE IS WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE A TWO OTHERS WANT ONE SHOULD THERE BE A DELAY IN THE IN THIS MATTER -- WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT UNDER -- DISSED UNDER THE ESTABLISHING -- YOU KNOW AB SEVEN FORTY SEVEN AS OF JULY FIRST. IT IS REQUIRED THAT ANY WATER RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT MATTERS BE HANDLED BY THE OFFICE NOT BY THE BOARD ITSELF AND THAT WOULD CREATE A GAP IN OUR ABILITY -- TO ENFORCING HOLD HEARINGS AND I WE THINK THAT THAT IS AND I'M NOT A GREAT MESSAGE I'M. TO BE SENT -- TO NOT THE COMMUNITY AGES IS -- I'M COMPLIANT BUT TWO OUTLIERS WHO MIGHT SEE I AS A LICENSE TO NOT COMPLY OR TO ASK FOR HEARINGS. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD WRAP THIS OFFICE UP SLOWLY START WITH A SMALLER STOP. UP PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS -- ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS OFFICE IS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF A SUBSTANTIAL BACKLOG. AND DELAYS THAT DO OCCUR SO WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO GET THE OFFICE UP TO FULL STRENGTH DEAL WITH THOSE BACKLOGS AND AND HAVE THIS BE A MUCH MORE TIMELY AND EFFICIENT -- OPERATION STONE THE THE MOTION IS TO APPROVE THE BUDGET THAT WILL ALLOW THE AGENCY TO IDENTIFY WHO THOSE THREE OF HEARING OFFICERS WILL BE THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT STAFF YOU STILL HAVE THE RESOURCE BOARD -- MEMBERS DOING THOSE HEARINGS NOW THE TRANSITION WOULD OCCUR ON JULY THEFIRST IS LIKE WE GET THE NEW BUDGET IN AND WE SAY HERE'S THE DOCKET. AS YOU WOULD IN COURT YOU SAY OKAY YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE FOR THE IT'S THE IMPARTIAL HEARING OFFICER VERSES BECAUSE THE PARTIAL KERN OFFICER. WELL I I I'M NOT GOING TO IGNORE THAT THE BOARD IS IS IS NOT IMPARTIAL I THINK THAT WE WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THE COURTS HAVE. HAVE THAT THAT OUR CURRENT -- OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCESS -- IS LAWFUL BUT IF THE IN A TO THE EXTENT THERE HAS BEEN A PERCEPTION PROBLEM THIS THIS THIS THIS LOOKS LIKE A GREAT WAY TO CARE THAT AND TO HELP. HELP THE BOARD TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO OTHER. MATTERS OF WHICH IT HAS MANY -- SO YES THAT THAT IS THAT IS OUR LA -- YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS. WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THIS PROPOSAL OKAY THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICERS. AS SET FORTH IN. AB SEVEN FORTY SEVEN LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE WHITE HOUSE GIVE MEMBERS I'M ROBERT GORE FROM THE QUALCOMM GROUP REPRESENTING KERN COUNTY WATER KINGS RIVER WATER KINGS RIVER CONSERVATION DISTRICT. MODESTO YOUR GEISHA DISTRICT AND THE CITY OF FRESNO. WE APPRECIATE THE WATER BOARD'S COLLABORATIVE PROCESS -- THUS FAR AND WE SUPPORT MOST OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE HOWEVER THE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION MAY BE TEMPTING TO LOOK AT HIS. BUDGET DUST BUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND FEE PAYERS IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IT REPRESENTS WE WERE TOLD BY WATER BOARD STAFF ON MONDAY A 15%. RATE INCREASE -- WHICH WE FIND SOMEWHAT BURDENSOME AND IN THE FIVE SUPPORT POSITIONS THE HEARING OFFICERS ARE ARE ARE WONDERFUL. THEIR WATER RIGHTS LAWYERS THEY'RE NOT CHEAP AND WE FULLY SUPPORT THAT BUT THERE ARE POSITIONS. FOR SUPERVISING ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM MANAGER STAFF SERVICE ANALYSTS TO SENIOR ENGINEERS AND ANY GPA THIS IS A SAVINGS OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WOULD IMPACT THE RATE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AS YOU CAN TELL -- ALSO -- ONE LAST REQUEST OF THERE WAS A B. C. P. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO REDUCE BACKLOGS FOR PERMITS THEIR UP TO FORTY FOUR YEARS THAT'S MY PERSONAL FAVORITE -- WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A COMPLETE ACCOUNTING OF THAT SO WE LIKE THIS COMMITTEE TO REFER TO REQUEST SOME TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTING OF THAT BCP PLUS THE PROGRESS OF MADE FOR THIS ONE NEXT. STRUCTURE MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS ITEM -- WE'RE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE WE THINK THAT IT. CAN INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH THE WATER BOARD DEALS WITH THESE WATER RIGHTS ADJUDICATORY MATTERS AS WELL AS INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. I WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE WATER BOARD STAKEHOLDER PROCESS RELATED TO THIS THE FIRST MEETING WAS HELD ON MONDAY OF THIS WEEK. ON IT AND WE ARE FRANKLY CONCERNED WITH THE 25% FEE INCREASE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DRIVERS THERE AS WAS INVOLVED IN THE TESTIMONY BUT THE B. C. P. IS A MAJOR ONE ON ITS ENCOURAGING TO HEAR TODAY THAT IT'S 7% OF THE FEE INCREASE BUT WILL NEED TO RECONCILE. THAT WITH WHAT WE HEARD OR JUST LIKE TO BRIEFLY ECHO THE CONCERNS ARTICULATED BY MISTER GORE ARE PARTICULARLY ON STAFFING -- CONSISTENT WITH THE GOAL OF AB SEVEN FOUR SEVEN IN THE B. C. P. AND ASEXPLAINED ON THE STAFF pANALYSIS THE GOAL HERE IS TO HAVE HEARINGS HELD BY QUALIFIED HEARING OFFICERS WHO WHOSE FOCUS IS. TO PLY THEIR SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE TO PROVIDE A HEARINGS AND PREPARE PROPOSED DECISIONS AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHAT ROLE THE OTHER STAFF POSITIONS -- DETAIL BY MISTER GORE INCLUDING MULTIPLE STAFF ENGINEERS AND THE CONSULTING RESOURCES WILL PLAY IN THE YOU KNOW DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT WAS -- CONTEMPLATED BY EIGHTY SEVEN FOUR SEVEN TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN TODAY SO WE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS -- WITH THE WATER BOARD CONTINUING STAKEHOLDER PROCESS -- AND APPRECIATE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO DAIS IN AN THE WATER BOARD. FIVE PUBLIC COMMENT. IN THE CASE THAT YOU WERE ALREADY PREPARING THE THING HEARINGS YOU'VE GOT CURRENT STAFF THE PREPARES HEARINGS FOR THE SAID THE BOARD REPRESENTATIVES. AND IF YOU HAD INDEPENDENT HEARING OFFICER SHE COULD JUST USE THE EXISTING STAFF FOR OR SOME AUGMENTATION. THIS IS NOT WHAT'S BEFORE US I GUESS -- YES WE'LL SEE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE STUFF IS GOING TO NEED TO SUPPORT THE WORK IN INDEPENDENTLY SUPPORT THE WORK -- ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUCH OF ANALYSIS WORK OF THE HEARING OFFICER'S -- BUT IN THE MEANTIME THE BOARD. TO THE EXTENT THAT TIME BOARD TIME IS CLEARED UP THE BOARD IS GOING TO TURN ITS ATTENTION TO OTHER ENFORCEMENT MATTERS AND TWO OTHER -- OTHER OTHER HEARING -- RESPONSIBILITIES THAT IT HAS BRITAIN'S WITH RESPECT -- TO CORRECT AT TWO AM OTHER BACKLOGS AND SO. THAT THE THE BOARD STAFF THAT WAS WORKING ON THESE WATER RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT HEARINGS IS GOING TO BE -- TASK TO WORK ON THESE OTHER PETITIONS AND OTHER -- ENFORCEMENT MATTERS BEFORE THE BOARD THEY WILL BE FULLY OCCUPIED. I'M AGAINST AN IN IN THEIR IN SUPPORTING THE BOARD ON OTHER MATTERS URALS. ACCOUNT -- HIGH -- HEARING. I I WOULD HOPE I WILL TAKE A LOOK. OKAY THERE'S A M.. THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATOR -- ACQUIRE TO PROVE THE BUDGET -- FOR THE REQUEST FOR HEARING OFFICERS AS REQUESTED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I CASKEY I JONES. GLANCE. MORNING. I PRESUME YOU'LL TAKE THE PUBLIC COMMENT DODD. DOES REMARKS ON ON THIS -- CAREFULLY WHAT AS WE PROCEED WITH THE PROCESS YES MISTER CHAIR WE WILL BE HAPPY TO TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS LET'S MOVE TO ST. DRINKING WATER -- SYSTEM SANITARY SURVEY. ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTEEN THE ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTEEN WE'RE REQUESTING SIX ADDITIONAL PERMANENT POSITIONS AND ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACCOUNT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER. OF TOTALLY CENTERS SERVICE COMPLETED ANNUALLY. CENTER SURVEYS ARE BASICALLY OUR OUR MAIN WAY OF CHECKING UP ON WATER SYSTEMS THERE ARE INSPECTION COMPONENT THAT WE DO AT ALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. UNDER OUR JURISDICTION IT'S ABOUT 60% OF THE DIVISION'S WORKLOAD SO IT'S OUR OUR BIGGEST WORKLOAD COMPONENT. THIS IS THE SECOND INCREASE WE'VE HAD WE IN -- USUALLY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN RECEIVED TEN POSITIONS THAT. WAS ABLETO IMPROVE OUR BACKLOG OF SANITARY SURVEYS FROM 75% 88% COMPLETE. I'M NOT A BACKLOG WAY BUT THE COMPLETE SIDE. AND SO -- WITH THIS WE LOOKED -- WITH THIS INCREASE WE LOOK TO INCREASE THAT TO AT LEAST 94% OR ABOVE THAT AS WE ARE ABLE TO MORE STAFF. DEPLOYED IN IN THIS AREA OF WORK. NOW FOR THESE PICK AT THESE ADDITIONAL SIX PEOPLE I THINK IT'D BE FOCUSING ON THOSE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE PUBLIC. WATER SYSTEMS THAT WE KNOW ARE. FAILING OR ARE NOT PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER -- TO THE FOLKS THIS IS GONNA BE SYSTEM WIDE. THIS IS MORE SYSTEM WIDE CERTAINLY WE ALREADY PUT A LOT OF FOCUS ON THOSE SYSTEMS WE KNOW ARE FAILING -- BUT THERE ARE SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE GETTING TUNE SO THIS IS REALLY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT WE CAN. AND PRESUMABLY THESE AT THIS ADDITIONAL SURVEY INFORMATION WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ON CONSOLIDATION AND YOU KNOW MANDATES. THEN THE LIKE THESE THESE ARE THE OUR FRONTLINE STAFF THAT ARE IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE THE FIRST CONTACT OF THOSE WATER SYSTEMS THERE ARE EARLY INDICATOR OF WHEN THEY'RE LIKELY TO HAVE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE. AND WE WE WOULD REALLY RATHER GET TO AN EVEN BEFORE THEY SHOW UP ON ARGUMENT RIGHT TO WATER LISTS OF DEFINITELY. AND I DON'T HAVE GOOGLE MAPS WITH ME BUT I ASSUME THAT GIVE IN TRAFFIC PATTERNS AREAS THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK THAT THAT THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BE MAXIMIZING. EFFICIENCIES OF WHEN THEY GO OUT TO THIS AREA WITH THE DIFF WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE I IMAGINE YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS A LOOK AT THE MAP SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE. A LONG DISTANCE TO GO TO DO ONE SURVEY OTHERS MAY BE. IT'S WHAT THEY SAY IN LA FOR THE FOUR OH FIVE YEAR. IT'S JUST A BAD THING. YES WE WE DEFINITELY DO TRY TO OPTIMIZE THAT WAY AND YOU'RE RIGHT IN LA WE DON'T TALK ABOUT DISTANCE WE TALK ABOUT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET THERE. ELLIE ARE YOU HAVE SOMETHING. ON ISSUE. SEVENTEEN NOTHING TO ADD ALL RIGHT THIS IS. A QUESTION PROOF IS BUDGETED LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET REQUEST FOR SIX ADDITIONAL PERMANENT. CENTER MONEY MOVES PROPOSAL WILL CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CASKEY AYE. DOWNS MCGUIRE [inaudible] RUNNING [inaudible] DURING. I WILL KEEP THAT ROLE FROM FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS LET'S MOVE ON TO MICRO PLASTICS YES MICHAEL PLASTIC SO. FAR THIS REQUEST IS FOR A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF LE JUST A LITTLE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS OF A LICENSE PLATE FUND -- END OF LETTER THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONE TIME COSTS LARGELY CONTRACT BECAUSE IT WE WILL EXPAND TO WORK ON DEVELOPING A METHOD OF TESTING FOR MICHAEL PASTA X.. MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE A VERY COMPLEX WORLD WERE ENTERING INTO HERE WERE. PLEASE TO START ON THIS THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST STEP IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HEALTH IMPACTS IS TO HAVE A METHOD THAT CAN BE REPEATED BY EVERYBODY THE DOES THE TEST SO THAT WE KNOW. WHEN SOMEONE GIVES AN ANSWER IT'S THE SAME IN DIFFERENT LABORATORY OR NOT? AND THE COMPLEXITY OF MICHAEL PLASTICS COMES FROM THE FACT THAT JUST BY THE MID TERM OF IT IT CAN INCLUDE. PAINT CHIPS MICROFIBER IS FROM CLOTHING PLASTIC THAT'S DEGRADED IN THE ENVIRONMENT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND TESTING FOR IT IS OF WHETHER OUR ACADEMIC METHODS OUT THERE. THERE'S REALLY NONE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH A FULL METHOD DEVELOPMENT TEST PROCESS AND SO THIS FUNDING WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT. AND I GET TO THAT AND START ON THE PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENT HOW WHAT THE QUANTITIES ARE AND WHAT POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACTS ASIDE FROM THAT [inaudible] LIAM [inaudible] NOTHING [inaudible] CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU YOU MENTIONED IT AT THE END THAT PART OF THE TESTING. THERE'S THE DETECTION AND THEN THERE'S UNDERSTANDING THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT YES. WHAT PART OF THIS OR WHAT STUDIES ARE GOING ON TO MEASURE? PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF THESE MICROBEADS IN DRINKING WATER. SO THERE'S NONE TAT ARE UNDER WAY BY US SPECIFICALLY WERE REALLY TASK OF TRYING TO GET THE YOU THAT THE METHOD ESTABLISHED SO THAT WE HAVE A COMPARABLE BASIS TO GO FROM I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE ACADEMIC RESEARCH GOING ON ASSOCIATED WITH THE HELP OF MICHAEL PLASTICS. IS THAT'S ANOTHER COMPLICATED FACTORS WELL BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE MARKER PLASTICS THE PLASTIC THEMSELF IS NOT. THE TOXIC COMPONENT IT'S THAT IT ABSORBS CAN INTO BEING A DELIVERY METHOD OR A FOCUS CONCENTRATION SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK YET TO BE DONE ON THIS. WOMAN MONETARY AND ONE IN ONE AREA MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN ABSOLUTELY YES OTHER RIGHT. I APPLAUD THE EFFORT TOM. I WOULD THINK IN ADDITION TO THE DETECTION. COLLECTING THE SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT IS BEING DONE BY OTHERS IS THAT PART OF YES SO CORRECT SO WE'RE WE'RE ALREADY. PRE PLANNING AS WERE DEVELOPING THE METHOD AND GOING TO THAT WORK THAT THE HEALTH RESEARCHERS WILL BE THERE WITH US AND UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW KIND OF WHERE WE'RE TARGETING WITH THAT. AND BE PART OF THE METHOD DEVELOPMENT SO THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO BASICALLY. KEEP THE BALL ROLLING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER SO IT'S A SEAMLESS TRANSITION ASSUME YOU'RE YOUR FINDINGS ARE. PUBLIC RECORD WE NEED HELP ABSOLUTELY YES. AND PRESUMABLY ONCE WE GET THE ANALYTICS IN THE PROCESS THAN THAT. THAT WHATEVER WORK IS GET SUCKED UP ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY NINE YOU KNOW. OUR FINAL DANCE TODAY WHEN THAT WHEN THAT. SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT KITS ARE RESOLVED THEN THAT WHATEVER WE HOWEVER WE MEASURE IT WE KNOW WHAT IT IS THEN THE ANSWER. SHOULD BE WHICH SHE I WILL BE LOOKING FOR IT THERE. ALL RIGHT LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING WE HAVE. MICHAEL PLASTICS IN DRINKING WATER WHICH IS RESULT OF FROM SB OF THE PROPOSAL THERE'S A MOTION TO MOVE IT WAS CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING -- AND CALL THE ROLL. WE CASKEY AYE JONES REQUIRE MONEY. WE'LL KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND MOVING ON TO THE GOVERNOR'S RESPONSE THE YET ANOTHER. SENATE BILL THIS IS A NON POSSIBLE RE USE WATER SYSTEMS FROM SB. NINE SIX SIX PLEASE PROCEED YES CORRECT SO THE THE BOARD IN THIS ISSUE IS REQUESTING NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FROM GENERAL FUND INCLUDING FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR ON GOING FUNDING -- TO PERMIT POSITIONS AND A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ONETIME CONTRACT FUNDS TO BASICALLY DO AN EXPERT PANEL AND DEVELOPER WRIST BASE LOG REDUCTION TARGETS FOR PATHOGENS. REGULATIONS FOR ON SITE RECYCLING. I GUESS IT'S KEY TO NOTE THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW WE DO A LOT OF RECYCLING IN CALIFORNIA A MUNICIPAL SITES LARGE. COMPONENTS WHERE WE DO THE RECYCLING IN WERE OR REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS. BUILDING LEVEL RECYCLING SO THE WATER NEVER LEAVES THE BUILDING IT BECOMES RECYCLED AND CAN BE IT'S MERGING AREA THAT THAT'S HAPPENING IN WERE YOU KNOW PARTS OF ONE OFF APPROVALS AND SAN FRANCISCO EN EL áREA IS ASSOCIATE WITH THIS. AND REALLY THIS IS TO DEVELOP THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE SO THAT. LOCAL AGENCIES CAN DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT THIS PROGRAM IN AND USE THOSE. GUIDELINES WE GIVE THEM IN THIS ROAD FOR APPROACH TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT CAN GOING FORWARD IT'S NOT GONNA BE. STATE PROGRAM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUILDING SCALE IT OBVIOUSLY HAS TO BE THE LOCALS THAT ARE INVOLVED. AND WE'RE TALKING NOT JUST GRAY WATER WE'RE TALKING BLACK WATER FOR TALKING ALL THE WHOLE WATER DOES CONTAIN AND WE HAVE A DIVERSITY OF WATER SYSTEMS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS WOULD BE. FOCUSED ON THE TOP AND OUR LEASE I ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL BE DAY THE EFFICIENT ONES THAT ARE. THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND THAT WITH THIS DECIDE TO TRY THE OUR IN HOUSE. OF TREASON SYSTEM. YEAH ABSOLUTELY IT'S GONNA BE OF YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE COST PROHIBITIVE IN MANY AREAS THIS ISN'T A UNIVERSAL SOLUTION BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY APPLICATION FORD IN SOME CASES. WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU KNOW NOT TRANSPORT WATER BACK AND FORTH LONG DISTANCES AND JUST RECYCLING ON THE SITE WHERE THAT? LOW'S THERE THE CAPABILITY THAN TO REUSE IT IS AND IT MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE IN THOSE COMPONENTS. TO FURTHER THE WATER RESOURCES A CALIFORNIA. NO ANY COMMENTS ON THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE. REVIEWS WATER SYSTEMS LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS. ISSUE NUMBER. NINETEEN GET THE BALL ROLLING ON ON SITE RECYCLING. ALL RIGHTY WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. IT'S MOVED BY CENTER REQUIRE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASKING HIGH. IN THE CHOIR [inaudible] MORNING. KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN IN. A MOVE ON THE ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY WITH THE SEWER SERVICE PROVISION FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES PLEASE PROCEED. HI YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YES WE ARE SEEKING I'M. FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT A NEW PROGRAM ESTABLISHED UNDER SB -- TWELVE FIFTEEN WERE SEEKING THREE ADDITIONAL PERMANENT POSITIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE WASTE DISCHARGE PERMIT FUND. FOR THAT THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR AND SIX AN ADDITIONAL -- PERMANENT POSITIONS -- I AM IN IN THE OUT YEARS. SB. TWELVE FIFTEEN AUTHORIZED THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY BOARDS TO ORDER A CITY COUNTY OR SPECIAL DISTRICT WITH AN EXISTING RECEIVING SYSTEM -- THAT IS A COLLECTION SYSTEM AND OUR WASTE WATER TREATMENT SSTEM TO PROVIDE SEWER SERVICES EXCUSE ME SEWER SERVICES TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE INADEQUATE SEPTIC TANKS SYSTEMS. FOR THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH OVERALL IN THE PREVENTION PREVENTION OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER SO THIS YOU KNOW IMPACTS NOT JUST INDIVIDUAL -- PROPERTIES WITH SEPTIC SYSTEMS BUTTON POTENTIALLY CAN CONTAMINATE LARGER GROUNDWATER SOURCES. USED -- FOR THANK YOU WATER AND AFFECT ME SO -- THEM -- AS AS AS I'VE SAID THEY IF THEY'RE NOT IF IF SEPTIC TANKS ARE IMPROPERLY MAINTAINED IF THEY WEAR OUT OVER TIME IF THERE USED TO BE ON THEIR ORIGINAL CAPACITY. THEY OFTEN BECOME A SOURCE OF POLLUTION FOR SURROUNDING WATERWAYS AND GROUND WATERS -- AND OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT THERE ARE DOZENS OF WATER WAYS THAT ARE NOW -- COMPROMISED -- AND IMPAIRED DUE TO CONTAMINANTS THAT CAN REASONABLY BE TREATED TRACED TO LEAKING SEPTIC. TANKS IN THE SURROUNDING REGION AND CURRENTLY THERE IS ACTUALLY LITTLE INCENTIVE OR OR EVEN ABILITY FOR MANY PROPERTY OWNERS TO MAKE THE CHANGE FROM SEPTIC TO SEWER. IN MANY CASES SEPTIC TANKS SERVE RURAL AND SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS -- MOST MOST OF THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS REALLY HAVE LITTLE ALTERNATIVE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL ABILITY OR ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITY. TO I'M NOT TO DO TO USE ANY OTHER SYSTEM BUT EVEN IN CASES WHERE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO COMMUNITIES THAT DO HAVE -- A FUNCTIONING WASTE WATER SYSTEM. SEWER SYSTEM -- THE COSTS OF REMOVE. AND FREQUENTLY. THE POTENTIALLY POTENTIAL RECEIVING -- SYSTEM IS UNWILLING TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL -- WITH WATER AT ABOUT COMMUNITIES -- SERVE BY SEPTIC TANKS. THE RESOURCES THAT WERE REQUESTING WILL LLOW THE STATE AND REGIONAL BOARDS TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB -- TWELVE FIFTEEN IN ORDER THE NECESSARY CONSOLIDATIONS FOR DISADVANTAGE -- COMMUNITIES -- SO EACH CONSOLIDATION OR EXTENSION OF SERVICE. CHIEF WILL ENSURE REAL RELIABLE SERVICE. THEY WERE SERVICE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- AND PROTECTS WATER QUALITY AND I'M. IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH GENERALLY OF COURSE WE WON'T MOVE TO MANDATORY CONSOLIDATIONS WITHOUT A LOT OF PROCESS IS SPECIFIED IN THE LEGISLATION. AND ATTEMPTS -- TO NOT TO WORK EXTENSIVELY WITH THEM BUT ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION THEY NEED AND I'M TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY FUNDING SOURCES THAT WOULD ALLOW -- THESE KINDS OF CONSOLIDATIONS TO AND IMPROVEMENTS TO OCCUR MMHM. LET'S SAY YOU HAVE. THREE HOMES THAT ARE ON SEPTIC. AND THERE'S A SEWER SYSTEM RIGHT NEXT TO IT AND FOR SOME REASON LET'S JUST SAY IT'S JUST THE LEGACY THEY JUST WERE NEVER ON IT WHEN THE HOUSES NGUYEN IN. ITS ITS DEVELOPED AROUND. SO WITH THE SEPTIC SERVICE. MAINTAINED AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM THERE'S NO LEAK. FLUSH THEM OUT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY NEED TO IN THERE OKAY THAT'S ONE FAXES. SITUATION LET'S SAY YOU GO THERE AND YOU SEE THAT THEY ARE. NOT MAINTAINED OVER USE FALL APART AND CONTAMINATING THE GROUND WATER THAT'S THEIR WHAT MUSCLE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND IN THE AUTHORITY THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN ON TWELVE FIFTEEN ORDER. THAT'S SEPTIC OUT. YOU GET A CONSOLIDATED WITH THE WITH THE EXISTING SYSTEM I DON'T WANT TO BE. YOU KNOW. JULIUS CAESAR UP HERE BUT AT THE WORD WE WERE WE BECAUSE WE WE WANT TO SEE SOME CONSOLIDATION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH I MEAN I THINK. WITH THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. RESULT IN DIFFERENT ACTIONS BY THE BY THE BOARD. YES I I THINK THAT IF WE EVER WILL I PREVIOUSLY WE DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY ON THE ON THE SEWER SERVICE SIDE TO REQUIRE MANDATORY -- CONSOLIDATIONS AND WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY TARGET AREAS WHERE WE HAD NOT FUNCTIONING -- SU AD SEPTIC SYSTEMS. IT IN CERTAIN AREAS IF THEY ARE WELL MAINTAINED AND PROPERLY MAINTAIN THEY STILL ARE AND AND AND OKAY ALTERNATIVE. BUT IF HEY'RE NOT IF THEY AREN'T FUNCTIONING AND IF THERE IS A LANCE EASILY OR EFFICIENTLY -- ECONOMICALLY I'M THIS IS NOW A TOOL THAT WE HAVE IN OUR TOOLBOX. TO BOTH THE EMBERS. OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE. THIS NON FUNCTIONING -- SEPTIC SYSTEM AND THE BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH I MEAN THE THE POINT IS SET AT THEY MAY BE FINE WITH THE NON FUNCTIONING AS A SEPTIC SYSTEM BUT IT'S IT'S HAVING ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE GROUND WATER IN GENERAL AND CAN DOING CONTAMINATION. JUST WANNA. OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MUSCLE THEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGER CONSOLIDATION GOAL HERE OF THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING. AND AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON IN A MY ENTHUSIASM TO GET THESE FEELINGS SYSTEMS [inaudible] CONSOLIDATED AND AND THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THE HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO TO OPERATE SO. I DO THINK IT'S BOTH THE MISTER CHAIR THAT. SOME INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE OKAY WITH NOT HAVING A FUNCTIONING SEPTIC SYSTEM BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE. MANY -- INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST DON'T WHO WHO ARE NOT AN WHO SEE THE THE RISK TO THEMSELVES. I'M AS WELL AND AND THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL AS YOU SAY TO OR OR THE A POLITICAL MUSCLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT I I AGREE THIS IS THIS IS WAY BEYOND INDIVIDUALS IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH. THE PUBLIC. LA -- ANYTHING TO ADD ON THIS. OKAY THIS IS. SEVEN FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SIX POSITIONS AND ANOTHER ONE POINT -- SIX FROM THE WASTE WATER WASTE. THIS CHARGE PERMIT FUND SO PUT UP THE PUBLIC HEARING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE HERE ON SEWER SERVICE PROVISIONS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY CLAIBORNE ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY I HEAR A VOICE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL IN THE PROPOSED FUNDING -- WE WORK WITH RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN THESE COACHELLA VALLEY MANY OF WHOM ARE WORKING ON SEPTIC TO SEWER CONVERSION PROJECTS. AND ARE REALLY LOOKING AT SOLVING WHAT'S BOTH -- I HEALTH PROBLEM AND THAT WATER QUALITY THREAT -- IN THIS NEW AUTHORITY WHEN IMPLEMENTED WILL GO A LONG WAY. TO MANY OF THEM ARE MOVING VOLUNTARILY SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT SO. STRONG SUPPORT IN THANK YOU. CAN NEXT. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS JONATHAN NELSON WITH A COMMUNITY WATER CENTER ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR. JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA'S HUMAN RIGHTS -- WATER LAW ACTUALLY INCLUDES SANITATION AND WASTE WATER AND THAT DEFINITION BUT THAT OFTEN SLIPS FROM THE CONVERSATION I THINK. THIS TOOL WILL PROVIDE AN AUTHORITY THAT FRANK HAS BEEN NEEDED FOR A LONG TIME BUT ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT. THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS CONVERSATION IS TO SUPPORT IT AND THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO THE CONVERSATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH I REMIND MY COLLEAGUES YESTERDAY THAT LEGISLATION ESTABLISHING THE RIGHT DIDN'T INCLUDE THAT FUNDING FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STATE'S WE'RE DOING THIS AND IN BABY STEPS THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT. IT'S CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING. MOTION TO APPROVE. AS REQUESTED BY CENTER REQUIRE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL HI [inaudible] MCGUIRE. KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN IN MOVING -- TO ANOTHER AND ASSEMBLY BILL AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE STATE ADMINISTRATORS CONSOLIDATION PLEASE PROCEED. YES SO THIS REQUEST AS YOU AS YOU NOTED IS -- INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE CONSOLIDATION STARTED AS SB EIGHTY EIGHT SO THERE YOU GO -- WE'RE EXPANDING THE CAPACITY HERE THIS GRANTS DO WITH ORTIZ TO THE BOARD AND EXPANDS OUR ABILITY TO USE CONSOLIDATIONS AS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL. TO ADDRESS WATER SYSTEMS AND AS YOU MENTIONED WITH ISSUE TWENTY NINE COMING UP. KEY TOOL ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. OF THE SPECIFIC REQUEST IS FOR SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND OF GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS. ADDRESSED A GREATLY EXPANDED NUMBER POTENTIAL CONSULTING LEAVE WILL OCCUR AS A RESULT OF THIS -- REALLY COMBATING SMALL LARGE PURSE GIVES ME COMBATING THE APPLIED A SMALL WATER SYSTEMS IS IS REALLY ONE OF OUR OUR MAIN FUNCTIONS IN OUR BOWL ASSOCIATED WITH. A LOT OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING. AND THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING THERE'S SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE AND WATER SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO NINE HUNDRED WASTE WATER SYSTEMS AND SEVENTY FIVE ELECTRIC UTILITIES SO YOU CAN SEE THE FRACTURED NATURE. OF THE WATER UTILITY DELIVERY SYSTEM IS JUST OUT OF COMPORT WITH ITS OTHER COMPONENTS. TOM AND AS WE DRESS THAT. WE WE REALLY MOVING AHEAD 90% OF OUR VIOLATIONS COME. COMES WITH FIVE HUNDRED OR LESS CONNECTIONS SO IT'S OBVIOUS WHERE ARE BECAUSE OF CONCERN LIES. WITH THE UP. AFTER SB EIGHTY EIGHT WE ADDED TO STAFF TO WORK ON THIS SPECIFIC AREA PRIOR TO THOSE TWO STAFF WE HIT. A CONSOLIDATION AVERAGE OF ABOUT FOUR PER YEAR. AFTER THAT STAFF WE'VE NOW DONE FORTY IN ONE YEAR OR FORTY SIX IN ONE YEAR AND FIFTEEN THE OTHER FOR A TOTAL OF NINETY SIX SO THOSE TWO STAFF OF MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. WE BELIEVE THESE FOUR STAFFEL TICKETS EVEN FARTHER IT IN ADDRESSING THAT NEED. I HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WE'RE ASKING FOR TO PERMANENT POSITIONS. AND AND AGAIN IN MY MIND RIGHT NOW IT'S EVERYBODY WANTS HAVE MORE COLLABORATION PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD BE LAYS. LASER FOCUS ON THOSE WATER BOARDS YEAH IT'S GREAT TO BRING THEY HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS ALLEGEDLY. ALLEGEDLY AND WHEN WE GO IN. FOR IN IN -- YEAH OR POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION THAT'S I DON'T KNOW FIRED IF. IT WAS SORT OF BLACK AND WHITE IT'S IT'S IN A COUNTY YOU DON'T HAVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE. WHERE WITH ALL I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE ABILITY TO READ THE SYSTEM WHETHER THE PUBLIC KNOWS OR NOT WE'VE GOT THE AUTHORITY? TO ORDER THE CONSOLIDATIONS. THAT IS SO THE ADDED SO OTHERS OUT THERE IS A LOT OF PUBLIC WORK TO GOES INTO IT FIRST THERE ARE REQUIRED PUBLIC MEETINGS AS PART OF THE LAW AND I I BELIEVE THAT THEIR APPROPRIATELY THERE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF GETTING THE COMMUNITY ON BOARD WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING. A LOT OF TIMES WE DISCOVER THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SMALL WATER SYSTEM. AND KIND OF THEIR MOTIVATIONS SO IT'S HELPFUL FOR US TO HAVE THOSE PUBLIC MEETINGS THE ESTABLISH. THE COMMUNITIES CLEAR DESIRE TO MOVE AHEAD WITH CONSOLIDATION WE WOULD IT'S ALWAYS BETTER WHEN IT'S DONE ON GOOD TERMS AND NOT MANDATORY COMPONENTS SO WE DO A LOT OF WORK UP FRONT TO TRY TO GET IT TO BE BALLING. FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE PARTY IN THOSE. THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION OF THOSE. SPECIALIST WE HAVE WE ALREADY USM A TON ON THIS AND THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BACK FILL THE WORK THERE AND IT REALLY IT ALLOWS TO EXTEND AND THIS IS NOT ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEARING CEASE TO THE PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT'S ALREADY REQUIRED. WOULD JUST COULD BE DOING MORE. CONSOLIDATION ACTIVITIES GIVEN THE STATUS THAT THAT'S YES ALRIGHT YES THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION -- LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT A HERE ON ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY ONE THE STATE ADMINISTRATORS [inaudible] CONSOLIDATION. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN AYE REALIZATION OF WHAT COLOR BACK TO BACK THERE AND MY CLAIBORNE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL -- STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL ESPECIALLY INSOFAR AS ITS IMPLEMENTING AB TWENTY FIVE OH ONE WHICH GIVES THE STATE THE STATE BOARD AUTHORIZATION TO ORDER EXTENSION OF SERVICE THE PRIVATE WELL COMMUNITIES -- IT'S LONG PAST TIME TO START ADDRESSING THOSE THAT HAVE FAILING WELLS -- AND THOSE THAT HAVE WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS AND THE PRIVATE WELLS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING ON THAT. AND SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL THANKS. THANK YOU NEXT. TURN MEMBERS JONATHAN NELSON WITH THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER. I ALSO STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL -- THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED -- ROUGHLY TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS NOT SERVED BY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THESE ARE OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. AND AGAIN THIS IS A TOOL IN THE TO A LONG TIME TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY START CHIPPING AWAY AT THAT PROBLEM BUT AS WE'LL TALK ABOUT AT THE END OF THIS HEARING THE OTHER. PART OF THE COIN AGAIN IS THE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING BUT WE SUPPORT -- THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL AND WE HAVE SEEN AT THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE IN COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK WITH AND COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS SO. STRONG SUPPORT FOR THAT OFFICE AS WELL THANK YOU. IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE -- BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL BUSH BY CENTER MINING CULTURAL. ASKING BY [inaudible] MCGUIRE [inaudible] MONEY. KEEP THAT MATTER -- OPEN. I KNOW WILL PUT THE MATTERS APPROVED BUT WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY TWO THIS IS OUR WILDLIFE PREVENTION RECOVERY LEGISLATION. THE TIMBER HARVESTS. EXEMPTION A UTILITY CORD OR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PERMITTING. WHAT A TITLE FOR SB NINE A? ONE TWENTY TWO POSITIONS I'M. AND THE FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION MORNING THAT. THIS BUDGET YEAR ONGOING IS. OUR TEARS DOWN TO ONE POINT. EIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON YES MISTER CHAIR -- AS YOU AS YOU NOTED WERE LOOKING -- FOR TWENTY TWO PERMANENT POSITIONS AND THEN THE FUNDING THAT YOU OUTLINED -- GENERAL FUND AND 40% FROM THE WASTE DISCHARGE PERMIT FUND -- THE WATER BOARD -- I THINK AS WE ALL DO. SUPPORT THE THE VERY BROAD POSITIONS. VISIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION IS AIMED AT REDUCING. THE RISK OF WILD FLOWER FIRE. WILD FIRE AND ON INCREASED FOREST'S RESILIENCY -- THOSE ARE VERY LAUDABLE. GOALS IT IS GOING -- TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE THE OF OUTLANDER MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND AND THUS DISTURBANCES TO THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH MAY HAVE -- POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON WATER QUALITY ACROSS THE STATE'S THIRTY THREE MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND AND ROUGHLY. FORTY THREE THOUSAND MILES OF UTILITY CORRIDORS AND SO THE THE IT'S BEEN A NINE OH ONE WILL ALLOW. REQUIRED THE WATER BOARDS -- TO FULFILL CERTAIN -- AND IMPLEMENTATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNDER THE ACT AND WE'RE ASKING FOR THE STAFFING TO DO THAT -- SO. WE ARE CONCERNED I THINK -- AND THOUGHT -- IT IS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IF -- THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED ARE NOT CONDUCTED -- APPROPRIATELY THAT IT THAT THERE COULD BE AN INCREASE OF SETTLEMENT PESTICIDE -- DISCHARGES TO WATERS OF THE STATE THAT THEY COULD ALTER -- FOREST AND STREAM CHANNEL HYDROLOGY BY INCREASING AND CONCENTRATING STORM WATER RUNOFF INCREASING EROSION AND POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DISCHARGES TO SCREEN STREAMS -- INCREASE RISK TO DOWNSTREAM INFRASTRUCTURE IF THERE ARE LANDSLIDES. ON THAT COULD AFFECT ROADS AND LAND AND WATER CROSSINGS -- OR RESULT IN JUST THIS CHARGING CHEMICALS IN THE FORM OF PETROLEUM AND PESTICIDE PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED ADJACENT TO OUR UPSLOPE OF SURFACE WATERS. I'M AND AND THAT ANY OF THOSE IMPACTS COULD -- AFFECT BENEFICIAL USES OF STATE SEVEN TATIAN WHICH COULD. AFFECT HABITAT AND THUS THE HEALTH OF AQUATIC SPECIES AND AND THEIR HABITATS -- INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR ELEVATED WATER TEMPERATURES AND RESULT IN HUMAN HEALTH RISKS INCLUDING THOSE FROM HARMFUL ALGAL BROOMS BLOOMS -- AND POTENTIAL POTENTIALLY COULD -- THREATEN DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES THROUGH INCREASED SETTLEMENT IN -- AN INTRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS. SO PART OF WHAT WHAT WHAT THE WATER BOARD AND WHAT'S ACT WHAT WE'RE BOTH REQUIRED AN AUTHORIZED TO DO UNDER SB. NINE A ONE ARE TO FIRST DEVELOP A NEW STATEWIDE GENERAL ORDER OF PLEASE TAKE CHARGE DISK. DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS A NEW PERMIT FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF UTILITY QUARTERS -- AND THEIR ASSOCIATED -- ACCESS ROADS WITHOUT FOR SEVERAL POSITIONS -- AT THE STATE WATER BOARD TO GO THROUGH THAT. I'M AND AND ALSO TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM FOR CONDUCTING FIELD INSPECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT UTILITY QUARTER MAINTENANCE. AND THEN ON THE OTHER MAJOR COMPONENT -- IS. TO INCREASE NUMBER POSITIONS OR PROVIDE POSITIONS -- IN OUR REGIONAL BOARD OFFICES -- TO SUPPORT THE INCREASED NUMBER OF FIELD INSPECTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH TIMBER -- WITH WITH SOME OF THE NON DISCRETIONARY TIMBER HARVEST EXEMPTIONS -- THESE EXEMPTIONS NOW LOW ALLOW TEMPORARY ROAD BUILDING WITH NO PRE PRE APPROVAL REVIEW -- WHICH IS WHICH IS FINE BUT IT INCREASES OUR OUR IT STABLISHES OUR NEED NOW TO INSPECT THE WORK THAT IS DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS DONE -- IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY AND THEN IF NECESSARY TO PURSUE -- ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE CUTTING AN AUTHORIZED US DISCHARGES OF WASTE INTO THE WATERS OF THE STATE -- I I DID WANT TO SAY I'M AM JUST ONE THING ABOUT WHY IT -- MY THERE IS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION TO THIS -- ASK AND THAT IS THAT -- UNDER THE TEN NINETY TWO WHICH ESTABLISHED THE TIMBER REGULATION AND FORCE RESTORATION FUN THE BOARD IS PROHIBITED FROM COLLECTING PERMIT FEES -- FROM COMMERCIAL TIMBER HARVESTING OPERATION -- AND THERE FOR THE GENERAL FUND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE OF FUNDS -- TO TO SUPPORT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE DEDICATED TO THE FOREST. INSTEAD ENVIRONMENT I'M THE REST OF THE FUNDING COMES OUT OF THE THE IN NON FORESTED AREAS WOULD COME OUT OF OUR OUR FEE BASED FUNDING. OKAY HELP ME ORCHESTRATOR SAID SYMPHONY I'VE GOT YOUR FOLKS THERE I'VE GOT. WE'VE GOT. FIVE HUNDRED ACRES WE'RE GONNA DO THIS XCELERATED NINE OH ONE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN I'VE GOT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE I GOT. CALIFORNIA FORESTRY I GET U. N. F. GOT -- TO CALIFORNIA WATER BOARD THERE ARE REGIONAL WATER BOARD IS GONNA BE THERE. OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS A DESIRE ON THESE AND THESE PLANS TO REDUCE THE FUEL THAT'S IN ON THE ON THE FIELD. WE'VE GOT. FIELD INSPECTION. GUIDE ARE WE GONNA HAVE CONSOLIDATED FIELD INSPECTIONS ARE WE GONNA HAVE THREE FIELD INSPECTIONS BY EACH STATE AGENCY LOOK AT LET'S SAY THE ROAD. RIGHT. WE WILL COORDINATE WITH OUR SISTERS SISTER AGENCIES TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE I'D. DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE TIMING OF OUR INSPECTIONS AND WHETHER THOSE ARE AND THAT. CAN BE DONE IN IN SYNC OR NOT AND WE CAN RELY ON EACH OTHER'S WE WILL WE WILL HAPPILY LOOK INTO THAT BUT I THINK THAT IN BILL IN. WE DID WORK WITH OUR WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE RESOURCE AGENCY AND THIS AND THIS. NUMBER OF POSITIONS OUT AND ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AS WHAT WE COLLECTIVELY -- AND CAME UP WITH IN THE RUN UP TO THE PASSAGE OF OF OF THE LEGISLATION I MEAN JUST YOU KNOW FOR AN UNSOPHISTICATED CHAIR YES MY I WOULD SAY. WHEN YOU'RE PUT IN THE ROAD IN AS YOUR THINNING THIS FOR US THAT WAS SORT OF BE A GOOD COMMONSENSE ACTION TO TAKE PURSES WE'RE GONNA RUN RIGHT BY THE? THE THE WATERSHED ITS ALREADY. COMPROMISE AND WE'RE GOOD RUN -- LOGGING TRUCKS UP THERE I MEAN. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE GENERAL ORDER ON THE UTILITIES WHICH WHICH MAY HAVE SOME OVERLAPPING. YOU KNOW. INSURANCE WITH THE WATER QUALITY. SO PUTTING IN PUTTING IN ROADS AND YOU KNOW BEING BEING AM CONSCIOUS OF THE THE THE SLOPES THAT AND THE RISK THAT AND IT UNTIL FOR RUN OFF DOING IT DOING THE DOING THE WORK. I'M RIGHT AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE -- LASTING IMPACT THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY ROADS. THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES A LOT OF THEM. PRESSURE TO DO THEM. TO DO THEM SOME I THINK THERE'S SOME COMMON SENSE AND RULES OF THE ROAD THE RULES OF THE ROAD THAT PEOPLE WILL -- THAT WHO ARE CONSTRUCTING THESE ROADS WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOMETIMES DOING THINGS -- FASTER DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN DOING THEM BETTER AND WE JUST WANT TO BE ABLE -- TO CATCH. THEM. A POTENTIAL M. IMPROPER RISKY ACTIVITY EARLY ON RATHER THAN TRYING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME INVESTMENTS -- IN HABITAT RESTORATION THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS IN SOME OF THESE WATERWAYS AND CAN INVOLVE A LOT OF A LOT OF MONEY FROM OUR ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE. STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS AND TRYING TO HAVING TO DO THAT -- IN OF MITIGATION -- ACTIVITY. AGAIN OR AFTER THE FACT IS IF IF WE CAN THROUGH TIMELY INSPECTIONS AVOID OR REDUCE -- OR GET MEDICATION GOING QUICKLY I THINK THAT -- THE LONG TERM INVESTMENT. WILL BE PROTECTED AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND ALLOW THE APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES TO GO PRIOR APPROVAL NORMALLY THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ANA. SMALLER SCALE WOULD HAVE INVOLVED EITHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED AT ALL OR WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT -- TO OUR REVIEW HEAD OF TIME SO WE'RE SORT OF DOING I'M BACK AND ACTIONS THEM. BY A GUEST THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE CAN JUST LET CAL FIRE AND OUR FIRE TRUCKS GO UP. AND FIGHT THE FIRE ACT AS YOU'RE DOING IT AND JUST DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T HAD A REPORT OF WHAT THE EROSION IN THE B.. T. WETLAND AND HOW WATERSHED DAMAGE HAS BEEN FROM THE FIRES AND WERE SORT OF DEALING WITH THAT THE HUMAN CONSEQUENCES AND AND THE BURN AND AND GETTING THAT. TOXIC. MATERIALS ADDED THERE BUT WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH WATERSHED BY WATERSHED AND SAY WHAT WAS THE I GUESS IF I'M PLAYING MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK WHAT WAS THE AVOIDABLE OR UNAVOIDABLE -- CONSEQUENCES AND WHAT'S THAT COST COULD BE TRIED TO REPAIR THAT RIPARIAN WAY -- SO HERE AT LEAST WE MAY BE MOVING FAST BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT NEXT FIRE AND AND HOW. HOW THE? WORKS TOGETHER ON THESE ON THESE ACTIVITIES BECAUSE WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT THE HARVEST TO GO ON AND IN THAT CREW TO MOVE OVER TO THE NEXT. ONE AFTER THE OTHER RESOURCES TO GO AND SAY. WHOOPS. WE COMPROMISED THIS RIPARIAN. OUT WHERE THE HABITAT. FIX THAT. THAT'S A DIFFERENT REQUEST. SO SO WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT -- IN THERE WHEN THEREIS WHEN WHEN THERE IS A MASSIVE FIRE OR EVEN A SMALLER FIRE THAT THERE. OFTEN ARE VERY SUBSTANTIAL -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH I'M CONSEQUENCES AND THAT THERE WERE THERE HAPPEN AND IN SOME OF OUR RECENT FIRES A LOT OF LANDSLIDES AND SEDIMENTATION ISSUES AND HARM TO HABITAT AND WE'VE. HAD TO DO A LOT OF REMEDIATION IF WE CAN FIND -- AND MITIGATION IF WE CAN FIND SOME DOLLARS TO DO IT AND A LOT OF IT HAS YOU KNOW WE WE AREN'T ABLE -- TO SO WE'RE NOT AN THAT THIS IS A THIS IS A GOOD INVESTMENT IN. REDUCING RISK UP FRONT RATHER THAN -- DEALING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF A BIG FIRE WE JUST THINK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THOSE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THAT WE CAN -- IF IF WE HAVE THIS KIND OF SUPPORT TO TRY -- TO SURE THAT THE THE MEASURES THAT DO HAVE SOME IMPACTS ROAD ROAD SEGMENTATION OVERALL -- IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF IT DOES HAVE SOME. SOME IMPACT AND AND WE CAN JUST TRY TO MINIMIZE THAT I'M. AS PART OF THIS LARGER FIRE SUPPRESSION -- AND FOREST HEALTH INITIATIVE THAT THAT'S A WIN WIN. I GUESS THAT THE THE OBVIOUS NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE. YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS WERE USING THE FUN THAT WE HAVE. PREVENTION AND AND THIS IS INCLUDED IN THAT UMBRELLA WE ALSO HAVE HEALTHY SOILS. AND WE HAVE WETLAND REMEDIATION WE KNOW THAT WE CAN WE CAN IMPROVE WATER RETENTION BY JUST BY JUST. MAKING SURE THAT THE WATERSHED IS SORT OF WORKING THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WORK AND I'M NOT NOT A 100% -- I WASN'T EVEN A 100% OR IN SCHOOL BUT BUT IF WE COULD GET THE WATERSHED SORT OF DOING WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO. THAT NATURALLY THE WAY IT'S BUILT MONEY INTO DIFFERENT AREAS BUT JUST HAVE THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT WORK THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE OR IN THAT AT LEAST HAVE A IDEA THAT THEY COULD RECOVER -- SO BECAUSE THAT IS THE AUCTION RESULTS. MIGHT PROMPT THIS LEGISLATURE TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM SO. IT'S A HEADS UP I GUESS. FROM FROM THIS POINT IS THAT WE MAY WANT TO SEE MORE OF THIS TYPE. ON THE PREVENTION BUT I'M HEARING YOU SAY THAT THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB ON THE RESTORATION FOR THAT WERE ALL THE FIRES HAVE ALREADY BEEN BUT SHOULD BE AT A HEALTHY SOILS. YOU KNOW. PROGRAM SO. I'M. I THINK THAT. POST POST FIRE RESTORATION IS YOU KNOW T ABOUT. AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE ALL HAVING TO COME TO TERMS WITH WITH AND THINK ABOUT AND HAS ACTUALLY HELPED US. FOCUS AND GET BEHIND I AM. LEGISLATION LIKE THIS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT AS FREQUENTLY -- AND I GUESS ALL -- AND AND SO I I HEAR YOU I MESSAGE RECEIVED THAT IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL -- MAYBE THEY'LL BE MORE OF IT AND I I THINK THAT -- OUR MESSAGE IS IS THAT WE'RE ALL FOR IT AND WE JUST WANT. TO REINFORCE THE TO BE DONE AND THEN -- I SPOKE WAY IF POSSIBLE TO PROTECT WATER WATER QUALITY I'M. SO THAT WE AGAIN SO THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS -- AND MINIMIZE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WORK I I COMPLETELY KNOWLEDGE IT'S LESS -- OF DISTURBING AND DEVASTATING AND THEN -- TO TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE BENEFICIAL WATER USES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEN MAJOR WILDFIRES BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING IN IT WE SHOULD PROBABLY BEHOOVES US TO DO IT. RIGHT AND WHILE. HELLO COMMENT. I REALIZE THAT I SAID I WAS GOING -- TO HOLD THE OR HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ON THE MATTER ISRAEL BEHOLD OPEN AT THE END OF THE APARTMENT BUT THIS IS THE ONLY MATTER THAT. IS BEFORE US WITH THE STATE% WATER RESOURCES BOARD THAT WE'RE ASKING THE WHOLE OPEN SO. WILL CONDUCT A PUBLIC HEARING NOW SO IF THERE'S ANYBODY HERE INTERESTED. IN COMMENTING ON ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY TWO WILDFIRE PREVENTION RECOVERY LEGISLATION PLEASE COME FORWARD. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING WAS A MOTION BY SEN -- BATTLE. WE DON'T HAVE A IGNORE THAT MOTION. AND AND CENTER REQUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH IS THE CHAIR AND I DO APOLOGIZE AND HAVE. TO COME TO THE FISH FORM AND I'LL BE COMING BACK OBVIOUSLY TO VOTE. BUT BEFORE I DO IT IS GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT NOT EXACTLY IN THIS ISSUE BUT RELATED ISSUE -- THAT THE BOARD HAS BEEN EXTREMELY INVOLVED WITH AND THAT IS THE RECOVERY IN LAKE COUNTY BEEN AN ACTIVE ENGAGE PARTNER -- BOTH ON CONSOLIDATION UP IN COBB. A COMMENT IN IS WELL -- AS HELPING BUILD OUT THE SEWER PROJECT ANDERSON SPRINGS WE CAN REBUILD. THOSE UNDER NINETEEN HOME TO THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THAT. WERE BURNED DOWN IN THIS WHEN I SAY THANK YOU TO YOUR STAFF I AIM TO THE ENTIRE TEAM FOR ALL OF YOUR SYSTEMS OVER THESE PAST. THREE YEARS IT'S BEEN A HELL OF A THREE YEARS AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL CAN BE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING WITHOUT YOU JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU. ALL THE ISSUE OPEN MOVING ON THE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THREE THIS IS OR FAN SITE CLEANUP FUNDS. PETROLEUM CONTAMINATION ORPHAN SITES [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THE STATE BOARD IS REQUESTING A TEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME APPROPRIATION FOR THE PETROLEUM CONTAMINATION OR FAN SITE CLEANUP FUN -- IN FISCALYEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WE DO HAVE PROJECTS THAT ARE WAITING ON ARE AWAITING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND WILL WILL. WILL OR COULD BE FUNDED AS SOON AS THE AUTHORITY IS AVAILABLE -- SO -- THESE ARE SITES WHERE THERE ISN'T -- I AND AND IDENTIFIED AT RISK IDENTIFIED RESPONSE PARTY BUT WE DO HAVE -- AN ENTITY THAT'S ONE WILLING AND ABLE TO GO IN AND DO DO THE CLEAN UP THIS THE DEMAND FOR THIS. GOES UP AND DOWN -- ACCORDING TO SAY YOU KNOW BASED ON CERTAIN FACTORS BUT AT THE MOMENT WE DO HAVE SOME -- WE HAVE SOME PROJECTS IN THE QUEUE AND WE SAID AND FOR YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS VALUABLE IN TERMS OF PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY AND SHOWING OUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECT AND RESTORE GROUND WATER QUALITY L. [inaudible] WE DON'T. THIS IS THE LAST -- ONE I MISSED IT EARLIER ITEMS ON ISSUE -- SIXTEEN CAM K&lt;c.cyan&gt; ACCORDING TO&lt;/c&gt; THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE JUST WANT TO SUPPORT THE BUDGET REQUESTS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB. SEVEN FORTY SEVEN ESTABLISHMENT MISTREAT OF HEARINGS OFFICE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL FOR THE WATER BOARD TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE WATER RATES -- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS YOUR EARLIER RECOMMENDATION TO CLOSE THAT ITEM IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGETED AND SORRY I MISSED EARLIER. RIGHT. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING ON I ALL ISSUES RIVER RELATED STATE WATER RESOURCE SUPPORT AT THIS PART OF OUR HEARING -- THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER REQUIRE DISAPPROVE THE OR OR CAN SITE CLEAN UP. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASKING I TENS REQUIRE. MONEY STERN. WE'LL KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN. DON'T GO TOO FAR AWAY LET'S CALL UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE [inaudible] WE HAVE [inaudible] THREE MATTERS. HAVE A BATCH MATTERS THIS IS WHAT START OFF WITH THE THE OVERVIEW IF YOU HAVE ANY. NUMBER THIS IS SAID DEPUTY MASAHARU. YES GOOD AFTERNOON A CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MEMBER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. I YEAH REAL QUICK OVERVIEW -- THAT OUR BUDGET FOR NINETEEN TWENTIES APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY COMPONENTS. AND DAD IS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT SEVEN POSITIONS TO SUPPORT ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS. I A CAN RUN THROUGH OUR VARIOUS FUNDS THAT'S A HUNDRED ALMOST A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF AG FUND. FEDERAL FUNDS AT A HUNDRED AND SEVEN GENERAL FUND AT A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN FOR CANNABIS CAN POINT ONE FOR THE DROUGHT WATER PARKS CLIMATE COASTAL PROTECTION OUTDOOR ACCESS FUND. FORTY THREE MILLION FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. AND TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION AND OTHER FUNDS. AND IF AND I NOTICED THAT WE HAVE A A NET REDUCTION OF SIXTY TWO MILLION. AS IN FOR THE DAIRIES THE METHANE READ REDUCTION. I GAG I GUESS SOME OF THAT'S OFFSET BY THE HEALTH HEALTHY SOILS. AS I KNOW YOU SEE OF COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE THAT WANT TO CONTINUE THAT ANAEROBIC DIGESTER IN THE IN THE NEWER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. YEAH I HAVE CURRENT YEAR WE GOT NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR JERRY DIED GESTURES AND ALTERNATIVE NOR MANAGEMENT. AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THIS YEAR BRINGS THAT DOWN. TO TWENTY FIVE THAT WAS THE THE BIGGEST PART OF THAT REDUCTION. IN IN THE HEALTHY SOILS ARE REDUCTION [inaudible] I AM. THAT ONE OF SIXTY EIGHT WE HAVE. IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WERE STILL SPACE AND PROP SIXTY FOR THE HEALTHY SOILS. YES WE DO HAVE SOME FUNDING AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT ON HEALTHY SOILS. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SOME FUNDING AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ALSO FOR HEALTHY SOILS. WE HAVE IT IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES NOW. RIGHT I GUESS THE COULD THE QUESTION IS IS THAT IF YOU. THE SOONER YOU MAKE THE SOILS HEALTHIER OR START THAT PROCESS THE BETTER MORE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION MORE PRODUCTIVITY -- IS IT A PROBLEM OF GETTING. FARMERS ARE PEOPLE ARE TO PARTICIPATE WITH WITH IT OR IS THERE A IS JUST GENERALLY. SO YOU'RE WANTING TO KNOW ARE WE COMFORTABLE OR WHAT ARE WE GETTING DONE WITH WHAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED. YEAH IT IS A PROCESS WE HAVE TO START AND RELIES LARGELY ON DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. IN SOME OF THOSE ARE ON INDIVIDUAL FARMS AND IN SOME OF THOSE WILL BE COLLECTIVELY WERE OTHER GROWERS IN THE AREA COULD COME AND VIEW THEM. AND PROJECTS THERE RELATE HEALTH OF SOILS ARE GENERALLY THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN OVER TIME -- YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN APPLY SAY COMPOST MATERIALS MAKES OBSERVATIONS AND HAVE MEASURABLE RESULTS. BUT THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT INVOLVE THE GROWING OF COVER CROPS OR SPECIFICALLY ALTERING CHIT TILLAGE PRACTICES FROM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN LONG STANDING. IN MEASURING THOSE RESULTS OVER TIME. SO YEAH IT IS THIS KIND OF A SLOW YOU KNOW FROM THE THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOME THINGS YOU CAN PUT MONEY TOWARDS AND YOU CAN SEE IMMEDIATE MEASURABLE RESULTS AND SAY THAT'S A GOOD PRACTICE. SO THIS ONE HERE BECAUSE GROWING CYCLES GENERALLY RUN THROUGHOUT THE THE SEASONAL PATTERN IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT YEAH WE DO. WHO WHO SHARE YOUR INTEREST IN THIS OBVIOUSLY AND WE WANT TO PLACE THIS MONEY OUT THERE WITH PROJECTS THAT ARE TO US GOING TO HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF SUCCESS? IN A SPECIALLY REPEATABILITY IF IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE AND WE CAN MEASURE THOSE POSITIVE IMPACTS. AND THEN WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE SO THAT OTHER GROWERS AND RANCHERS ADOPT THOSE PRACTICES AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT. THE QUICKER THEY ADOPTED IN THE MORE WE GET THE OVERALL BIG PICTURE RESULT THAT WE'RE AFTER -- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A FILE ON THIS. WILLIAM A COMMENT ON THAT YOUR FOR YOU FOR HEALTHY SOILS NOW WE ASK [inaudible] FROM [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD LET'S. WITH THAT OVERVIEW LET'S MOVE THE ISSUE NUMBER. LET'S MOVE TO TURLOCK ANALYST POSITION NUMBER TWENTY FOUR YOUR NUMBER TWENTY FOUR IS FOR ALMOST FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND FOR THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA PHASE OF THE DESIGN BUILD PROJECT. FOR A NEW FULL SERVICE K. CALIFORNIA ANIMAL HEALTH HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY LABORATORY SYSTEM LABORATORY IN THE NORTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THIS ONE'S GOING TO REPLACE AN EXISTING FACILITY THIS. OBSOLETE IS PROBABLY NOT EVEN A STRONG ENOUGH WORD IT'S BOTH OBSOLETE IN ITS AGENTS FUNCTIONALITY BUT ALSO IN ITS SIZE. WELL RIGHT NOW WE ONLY PROCESS AVIAN US. A SAMPLES THERE WE CAN'T HANDLE ANYMORE MILLION ROOM THERE IN THE NECROPSY AREA TO HANDLE LARGE ANIMAL LIKE A DAIRY COW. AND AS YOU'RE AWARE TURLOCK SITS IN THE MIDDLE OF JERRY COUNTRY SO WE REALLY DO NEED THAT CAPACITY SO THIS. LAB IS ESSENTIAL FOR US TO HAVE THAT PRESENCE -- BUT IMPORTANT TO KNOW RIGHT NOW IN THE TIMES THAT WERE IN THAT WE FIND OURSELVES WITH. KEEPING THAT LAB CAPACITY GOING WERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY VERY BIG EFFORT TO TRY TO WRAP A KATE. VERY WANT NEWCASTLE DISEASE WHICH RIGHT NOW IS MOSTLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT AS RECENT AS LAST WEEK WE DID HAVE A SINGLE FIND UP HERE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHICH HAS THE PRODUCERS AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY VERY EDGY. SO IT JUST UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LABORATORY NETWORK THAT WE MAINTAIN AN TWO YEARS AGO THE BUDGET HAD ACQUISITION COSTS. INCLUDED IN AND THAT IS THIS. WRESTLING THESE THAT'S A G. SENT TO THE CURRENT FCILITY OR IS THIS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S NOT IT'S LOCATED A FEW MILES AWAY. BECAUSE ADJACENT I DON'T BELIEVE IT HAD THE CAPACITY TO REALLY BUILD OUT A LAB [inaudible] OKAY -- I'M YOU STILL OWN THE PROPERTY ON THE CURRENT LAP. THE CURRENT YEAH THE CURRENT LAB IN THE PROPERTY THERE THOSE VERY MINUSCULE. FOR WHEN YOU COMPARE TO THIS LAB OR GOING FROM ABOUT FIFTY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET ABOUT FORTY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. SO IT WILL BE [inaudible] WE APPROVE THE REQUEST. AND WE GO INTO THE DESIGN BUILD PROCESS HE GETS DONE WHAT DO YOU SEE HAPPENING WITH A FIFTY ONE FOOT FACILITY DECEPTICON -- AVIAN SPECIES FACILITY IS GET RENOVATED DOES A GET. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DEPARTMENTS [inaudible] ASSET. IN YOUR CHART FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE SURPLUS PROPERTY PROCESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. THE LOOK AT THE EXISTING FACILITY SEE IF THERE IS A USE. ONE I CONTINUE TO USE BY -- DEPARTMENT FOR NAGRA CULTURE WHICH WE DON'T ANTICIPATE BUT ALSO IF ANOTHER STATE ENTITY MAY HAVE A USE EVEN IF IT WERE RENOVATED OR IF IT WAS COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED IN -- COULD BE IS THE LAND AND THEN FROM THERE IT GOES THROUGH THEIR NORMAL PROCESS. I'VE SURPLUS THE NORMAL EGS PROCESS WELL YEAH DURING GO TO ANOTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY A COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEN BRINGING THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH AND BETTER PROCESS AND ALL MY TO RESPECT TO THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR D. G. S. IS JUST SEEMS. MIND BOGGLING SOMETIMES HOW INEFFICIENT WE ARE WITH WITH DEALING WITH THAT PROCESS ELLIE OKAY YOU HAVE A AN ANIMAL HEALTH LABORATORY COMMENT. WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THE PROPOSAL. OKAY -- THIS IS. THIS IS -- ALMOST FOUR MILLION DOLLAR. NEW FACILITY LABORATORY LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ON ISSUE NUMBER [inaudible] TWENTY FOUR HAVE A COMMENT. IS MAKE SURE I JUST WANTED FINANCE. AND I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE FOUR MILLION AS FOR THE DESIGN PHASES NOT THE ENTIRE LABORATORY WHICH WILL BE MUCH MORE COSTLY AND I'M SURE YOU. KNEW THAT BUT I WANTED TO CLARIFY. ITS DESIGN BUILD RIGHT WE'RE GOING FROM DESIGN DETAILED DESIGN BUILD SO THIS WOULD BE THE DESIGN WE WILL COME FORWARD NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER DEPENDING ON SCHEDULE WITH THE BUILD. OKAY I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS DONE BY WORKING DRAWINGS THE COST OF A WORKING DRAWING ON IT NOW AND AND THAT CONCEPTUAL CONS. I MEAN. IT'S I'M SURE. THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY ELSE MUST HAVE A LAB SOMEWHERE BUT THIS MAY BE THE STATE OF THE ART OKAY. HI MY NAME IS ASHLEY HILL AND I'M AT AN ACTING CO DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY LABORATORY WHICH IS THE SYSTEM. OF WHICH THIS LABORATORY IS A PART OF AND I JUST WANT. TO THANK -- WELL EXPRESS SINCE TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE I'M WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO REPLACE THIS AGING AND OUTDATED FACILITY -- UP WITH BOTH THE LAB THAT CAN STOCK IN THAT AREA AS WELL AS IMPROVED CAPACITY FOR HANDLING POULTRY RELATED ISSUES -- AS PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THERE ARE SOME EXISTING -- ISSUES AFFECTING THE CAMANCHE COMMERCIAL. AND YOU KNOW COMMERCIAL AND BACKYARD POULTRY INDUSTRIES. AND WE JUST HAD AN ISSUE COME UP YESTERDAY WHERE A COUPLE OF THE MAJOR POULTRY PRODUCERS IN THE AREA. ARE EXPERIENCING AN INFECTIOUS KARAI IS A OUTBREAK AND THE TESTING THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO BE DOING IN THE TURLOCK LABORATORY WE CAN'T DO THERE BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING FACILITY LIMITATIONS SO IT. THE SAMPLES ARE HAVING TO BE. DRIVEN UP TO DAVIS TO BE DOING THE TESTING UP HERE WHICH YOU KNOW SLOWS DOWN TURN AROUND TIME AND THE POULTRY INDUSTRY HAS EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING I'M. WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO APPROVE AS PROPOSED. CENTER MINING MOVES PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ASKING BY OWNS MCGUIRE MONNING. KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBERS AND LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BIO DIVERSITY INITIATIVE. YES THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST FOUR POINT TWO MILLION IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THREE POINT NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND. AUTHORITY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLAN ON GOING AND EIGHT POSITIONS TO INITIATE. PLANNING AND COORDINATION OF THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE CALIFORNIA BIO DIVERSITY INITIATIVE ROAD MAP. OF THIS PROPOSAL ALSO REQUEST FUNDING TO RESTORE PHASE NOXIOUS WEED MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD INCLUDE ESTABLISHING THE CALIFORNIA BIO DIVERSITY INITIATIVE WORKING GROUP. AND THAT WORKING GROUP WILL BE CO CHAIRED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. WHAT WE ENVISION HAPPENING HERE IS ACCELERATING AND STREAMLINING PREVENTION DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF INVASIVE SPECIES AND PASSED EXPANDING SETON GERM PLASM BANKING AS A HEDGE AGAINST PERMANENT LOSS OF NAY NATIVE PLANT BIODIVERSITY? AND ESTABLISHING A SOIL CARBON MAP OF CALIFORNIA. DUE TO OUR AGRICULTURAL WARRANTED MISSION CDFA AS UNIQUE EXPERTISE SEAT IDENTIFICATION SEED PHYSIOLOGY AND SEE QUALITY ASSESSMENT. THE FAA'S WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE ITS EXPERTISE AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER AGENCIES UNIVERSITIES AND NGOS TO WORK TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL PRESERVING AND PROTECTING NATIVE PLANT BIODIVERSITY. AND HELP IDENTIFY GAPS IN EXISTING EFFORTS. I KNOW THERE'S SOME CONCERNS THAT MAYBE THERE'S DUPLICATION OF EFFORT. AND THERE'S A A LACK OF COORDINATION WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER AGENCIES OR SOME OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE ALREADY DOING SOME OF THIS WORK. SO WE JUST WANT TO ASSURE THE CHAIR THAT -- WE REALIZE THOSE CONCERNS ARE OUT THERE AND WE VERY MUCH WANT TO WORK IN ALL OF THE AREAS THAT NEED THE ATTENTION AND THE EXPERTISE THAT OUR DEPARTMENT CAN PROVIDE. AND WE WILL GLADLY DEFER TO OTHER AGENCIES OR EVEN NON GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS TO HANDLE THE AREAS THAT THEIR BEST POSITION TO DO THE WORK WE APPRECIATE THAT WE WANTED IF THEY ENCOURAGED BY THE COLLABORATION WE JUST. WANTED FIGURE OUT WHERE THE HOUSE AT YOU KNOW WHO SHOULD BE DOING. YEAH AND THE TOUCH ON IS A GERM PLASM BANK. YEAH AND WE HAVE SAID WE HAVE LABORATORY TRAINED BOTANIST WHO ARE VERY WELL VERSED IN THIS AREA. AND SO WE FEEL THAT WE CAN BE VERY VALUABLE IN THIS OP. THERE ARE GERM PLASM BANKS THAT EXIST AROUND THE STATE A LOT OF THEM AROUND AND HIT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE'RE ASKING FOR MONEY TO DO A STUDY TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS THE BEST. ROLE FOR US TO PLAY AN OUT YOU SHOULD WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ENHANCING OUR CURRENT LAB FACILITY TO TRY TO DO MORE IN THIS AREA [inaudible] OKAY. HELLO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON TERMS LASSEN BANK WILL SHOW MY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WOULDN'T RAISE ANY SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH IT BUT AS NOTED IN THE ENGINE DAY. THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE GERM PLASM BANK -- ITS MISSION ALIGNS MORE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. OR WITH THAT -- DEPARTMENT IF IT NOW WITH CULTURE THINK IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NOW WITH CULTURE POINTED OUT THE INVASION THIS IS AS ATTENTIVELY SOMEONE WHERE THEY WOULD USE THEIR EXISTING LABORATORY CAPACITY. ON AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO OKAY. OKAY TO HOLD THE MATTER OPEN LET'S CONTINUE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS LET'S MOVE TO THE I'M GONNA SCREW THIS UP -- ASIAN CITRUS. PHYLLIS DILLER PHYLLIS IN THE LONG LONG BEING. DOT ACTION. YEAH THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY IN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN AGRICULTURAL FUND. TO FORTY AND SIXTY FIVE POSITIONS IN FISCAL NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING. BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING AS AS WE'RE GOING WE'RE PROPOSING TO STAND UP THE NEW DIVISION THAT WILL FOCUS ON FIGHTING BOTH THE ASIAN CITRUS PSYLLID AND THE RESULTANT DISEASE LONG LONG BANG. AND SO. THE CURRENT EFFORT RIGHT NOW EXIST PRIMARILY WITHIN ONE MAJOR LARGE -- BRANCH WITHIN OUR CURRENT DIVISION OF PLANT HILLS AND PEST PREVENTION. AND WE FEEL THAT THIS BETTER POSITIONS US TO TAKE THESE NEW RESOURCES AND PAIR THESE UP WITH SOME RESOURCES THAT OF BECOME SOMEWHAT DEDICATED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THIS EFFORT. AND PULL THEM INTO AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT WILL BE FOCUSED SINGULARLY ON THESE -- TWO CITRUS THREAT HERE. AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO HELP US OPERATE IT'S GOING TO KEEP THE FOCUS THE TRAINING THE LOCATION OF THE STAFF IN AREAS WHERE THEY CAN RESPOND REALLY QUICKLY TO NEW DETECTIONS. AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE EXISTING WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA. AND SIMILARLY SPEAKING THEN IT FREES UP SOME OF THAT FROM OUR EXISTING DIVISION THAT HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL TYPES OF RESPONSES NECESSARY WHEN THERE'S A PEST DETECTION SUCH AS MED FLY ORIENTAL FRUIT FLYER. IN ASIAN GYPSY MOTH OR THINGS LIKE THAT. SO WE FEEL OPERATIONALLY THAT -- THIS IS. THE RIGHT TIME IN THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS. LA -- DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT WHY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS LEFT OVER FROM THIS CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET WE WE DID RECOMMEND THAT YOU ASK ASK THAT QUESTION ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHERS THAT ARE NOTED IN THE AGENDA. AND BUT WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL -- GIVEN THE RECENT SPREAD OF ASIAN CITRUS SELIGMAN LONG BEING AND THAT -- FACT THAT AIDS IS CONTINUES TO SPREAD A SHOWN BY SOME OF THE GRAPHICS IN YOUR IN YOUR AGENDA. WE THINK THIS REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF AND IT'S A DIVISION IS REASONABLE. SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. WE GOT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS IN THREE POINT. EIGHT NINE MILLION IN STATE FUNDS FROM THIS BUDGET THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING. DON'T EXPECT TO EXHAUST. ON THE GENERAL FUND SIDE YES THAT IS CORRECT WE GOT A ONE TIME INFUSION -- FOR THE CURRENT YEAR OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT WAS ALWAYS GET A LARGE INFUSION LIKED OUT OF ONE TIME DOLLARS TO EFFECTIVELY SPEND IT -- BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT TO LEAN TOWARDS PERMANENT POSITIONS THAT MAY BE LEFT ON FUNDED IN FUTURE YEARS. AND SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS IN ON EFFORTS TO COULD BE ONE TIME IN NATURE -- HOWEVER WE DID PUT THE MONEY WHERE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND AS WE SPEAK THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS AND WE'RE STILL GONNA MAKE PROGRESS ON THE CERTAIN CHANGES IN OUR LAB PROTOCOLS IN THE WAY WE HANDLE SAMPLES AND WE'RE INCREASING OUR THROUGHPUT TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS SOME OF THE SAMPLES THAT COME IN OUT. OF THE FIELD SO THAT GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE WE CAN HIRE MORE PERMANENT STAFF TO COLLECTED DO MORE SAMPLING WORK CAN BE ABLE TO HANDLETHOSE WITHOUT CREATING BOTTLENECKS AT THE LAB. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING SO WE KNOW PART OF THIS. REVOCATION PROCESS IS GETTING INTO THE PROPERTIES OF FOLKS IS NOT THE COMMERCIAL. OUR FRUIT PEOPLE THIS IS THE THE THE GUY WITH AN ORANGE TREE IN HIS I HIS BACKYARD AND I KNOW FROM LAST YEAR'S HEARING HERE BEFORE THERE WAS A PROBLEM OF OF GETTING ACCESS TO PEOPLE'S HOUSE. AND AND DEALING WITH THE THE DETECTION AN ERADICATION. YEAH THOSE WILL ALWAYS BE ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM THAT WILL. HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH INNER CHALLENGES WE THINK WE'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB WE A LOT OF THIS MONEY ALSO GOES TOWARDS OUR REACH EFFORTS SO THAT WE CAN EDUCATE THE COMMUNITIES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR EARLY DETECTION WORKING PART OF OUR EARLY DETECTION WORK RELIES ON ACCESS. TO THE CITRUS TREES TO BE ABLE TO PULL LEAVE SAMPLES AND SEND THEM TO OUR LAB. IS EARLIER WE CAN DETECT THE DISEASE IN A TREE IN THE EARLIER WE CAN RESPOND TO IT AND YES IT DOES -- RESULT IN ABATEMENT OF THAT TREE WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE. BUT WE HAVE FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE ONCE THEY BECOME EDUCATED ON THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE DISEASE -- NOT ONLY TO CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL BUT JUST TO THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ALL THEIR NEIGHBORS HAVE TREES IN A LOT OFPEOPLE HAVE MULTIPLE TREES ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES WE END UP HAVING TO SUGGEST THAT. A LOT OF MORE INTERESTING HE TO ME I THINK PEOPLE. LIKE HIM FOR THE DECORATIVE I MEAN I GOT A DWARF LEMON TREE AND I GOT MORE LEMONS AND WHAT TO DO WITH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH IT JOHN I'M MARC COUPLE MONSTER ORANGE TREES AIR A LOT. YES A LOT OF ORANGE THIS LOT ORANGES TO ALL RIGHT WE DO WORK THROUGH THOSE CHALLENGES OF PROPERTY ACCESS -- BUT WE WE FEEL WE DO A PRETTY PRICE. NOT EXPANDING OUR FEDERAL FUNDS A WE WILL FULLY EXPAND OUR FEDERAL FUNDS UNFORTUNATELY AS WE WERE COMMUNICATING NUMBERS BACK AND FORTH WE MISS ESTIMATED AT NUMBER AND WE HAD ESTIMATED ARE FEDERAL FUNDS TO BE AT FIFTEEN MILLION THIS YEAR. AND WE'RE ONLY GONNA EXPAND TWELVE BUT OUR FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ONLY GOING TO BE AT TWELVE SO WE EXPECT TO FULLY EXPAND ON SO GENERALLY YOU KNOW HE TOUCHES RESULT IN AN ACCOUNTING ERROR ON OUR PART THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH THE WRONG NUMBERS. WE HAD SOME OF OUR DIALOGUE WITH LA L.. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. I'M. WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP PUBLIC HEARING ANYBODY HERE. WITH THIS. CITRUS PEST AND DISEASE PREVENTION OUR PROGRAM. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I MAY TOUCH ON DRAW FROM PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK. ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR PESTICIDE REFORM WE OPPOSE THE CITRUS BEST IN DISEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM% RESOURCE ASK FOR FIVE MILLION UNLESS. AS AMENDED TO ADD FUNDING FOR CDFA STAFF POSITIONS FOR INCREASING CITRUS PLANT RESILIENCE TO TACKLE HLB DISEASE. SO FAR CDFA HAS FOCUSED ON PEST CONTROL AND PEST MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS AND THE CURRENT BRIDGE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS ALSO FOCUSED ON EXACTLY THE SAME. PREVENTION IS AT LEAST AS IMPACTFUL AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE. RATIFICATION OF THE CROP DISEASE VECTORS IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND RARELY IF EVER WORKS WE STRONGLY -- CDFA TO VIEW THE MANAGEMENT OF HLB THE HOLISTIC COMPREHENSIVE MANNER AND REFRAIN FROM A SHORT SIGHTED APPROACH OF A SINGULAR FOCUS ON VECTOR CONTROL. IT IS CRITICAL TO INCREASE STAFFING IN CDFA OF SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELDS OF SOIL HEALTH AND MICROBIAL ECOLOGY. SELECTION DEVELOPMENT OF DISEASE RESISTANT SINCE WE ASK FOR INCREASED STAFFING AND A CORRESPONDING ADDITIONAL BUDGET ALLOCATION OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS ARE AT LEAST 20% OF THE OVERALL BUDGET ASK. A CONTROL OF CITRUS GREENING DISEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL. IN SUPPORT OF TODAY'S PROPOSAL WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR THEIR COMMITMENT -- TO ASSIST IN THE INDUSTRY WITH THE CONTROL OF THIS DISEASE AN INSPECTOR -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES HAPPENING -- BEYOND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING THE DEPARTMENT IN THE AND THE REASON AND THE IMPORTANCE FOR THE STAFF THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR IS THAT THEY COME IN AS THE AS THE WITH THE THE STATE. AND THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME OF THESE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IN CONTROL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NEEDED IN THESE URBAN AREAS. THIS IS DONE IN CONJUNCTION. WITH THE INDUSTRY HELPING FIND EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH. IT'S ALSO DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CITRUS INDUSTRY INVESTING. TENS OF MILLIONS OF ACTUALLY CLOSE AROUND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LAB. AT UC RIVERSIDE FOR THE PURPOSES OF A BIOLOGICAL. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL. I'M IN ADDITIONAL RESEARCH THAT'S TAKING NATIONWIDE. WITH FUNDING FROM USDA AND OTHER -- PRIVATE INTERESTS TO FIND A CURE FOR THIS DISEASE SO I THINK THAT IT'S HE NARROWLY FOCUSED I HAD TO LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT AND SAY THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE DOING -- IS ONLY FOCUSED ON ENFORCEMENT THAT'S THE ROLE RIGHT NOW. THEIR ROLE IS. TO TRY TO IS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO CONTAIN AN AND STOP THIS DISEASE. IN THE PAST THAT SPREAD TO THE INDUSTRY USDA THE UC SYSTEM IS TAKING ON THE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OF LOOKING INTO THE RESEARCH LOOKING INTO THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL LOOKING INTO OTHER EFFORTS THAT WE CAN PUT OUR HANDS AROUND. IN TRYING TO PREVENT THE DEVASTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA CITRUS INDUSTRY. LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER AREAS SO. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT THAT'S BEEN -- PURSUED. BY THE INDUSTRY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS TO LOOK AT THIS -- AND MID BECAUSE OF ALL OF THAT THAT'S HAPPENING WHAT CDFA IS PUT BEFORE YOU TODAY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SUPPORT A AND WE ASK FOR YOUR APPROVAL THANK YOU X.. THANK YOU TURN NUMBERS NIKITA CREDIT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AT LIKE TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF ME THAT WITH THE PESTICIDE ACTION ARE IN. THAT WORK WE TO OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL RECOGNIZE IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT ENERGY SIMILARLY BELIEVES THAT THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION SHOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT'S FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING PLANT RESILIENCE AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ORGANIC COMPLAIN CONTROLS THE WE'RE NOT RELYING EXCLUSIVELY ON PESTICIDES THAT JUST CLICK HERE FOSS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE HIGHLY NEUROTOXIC THANK YOU. OKAY. LET'S CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION IS PROVE HIS BUDGET. QUESTION FROM PLEASE. BERMAN. YOUR RESPONSE TO THE THE TWO CONCERNS ABOUT INVESTING IN RESURGENT. ORGANIC COMMITMENT TO MORE EXPLORATION. YEAH WE ARE DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO THAT. WE HAD A VCP TWO YEARS AGO THAT WAS A FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE ONE FAR PAST PREVENTION SYSTEM IN AN INCLUDED ABOUT SIX POSITIONS AND SOME DEDICATED DOLLARS. FOR BEEFING UP OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE. ALMOST TWO HISTORICAL LEVELS FOR INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT WE HAVE A BRANCH WITHIN OUR PLAN HEALTH AND PEST PREVENTION DIVISION. THAT IS CALLED THE INTEGRATED PEST CONTROL AND THAT'S WHAT THEIR FOCUS SAYS SO YEAH THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT AS PART OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AND TO THAT END WE ALSO HAVE DONE IN COOPERATED WITH -- WHAT WAS MENTIONED WITH THE UC AND WE'VE COORDINATED RELEASES OF PARASITIC WASPS THAT TARGET ASIAN CITRUCEL IT'S -- IT'S A TECHNIQUE THAT PROBABLY A LOT MORE MATURITY BEFORE IT CAN BE CONSIDERED MORE EFFICACIOUS ON A LARGER SCALE BUT EVERYTHING STARTS WITH DOING -- PROJECTS LIKE THE ONION AND EXPERIMENTING WITH THOSE TYPES OF TECHNIQUES AND I APPRECIATE THAT I'M ALSO CURIOUS IS CHLORPYRIFOS USED IN CONTROLLING THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT USE CHLORPYRIFOS. THIS MONEY DOESN'T GO TO FOR PEER FOR US NOW [inaudible] THANK YOU. LIKE. TO PREPARE TO MOVE THERE'S THERE'S A MOTION TO APPROVE HIS. THIS CALL THE ROLL. I CASKEY HI ENDS WITH MINOR MINING. MATTER OPEN THE CHAIR NEEDS. TWO OR THREE MINUTES A PERSONAL TIME WILL TAKE A PAUSE BEFORE WE GET TO THE VARIOUS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS STRUCTURE LIKE SHOULD BE LIKE ALRIGHT -- YEAH YEAH THE TRANSITION [inaudible] YEAH. I LIST BRING THE MEETING. BACK TO ORDER WE'RE GOING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY SEVEN AND THIS IS. ENTITLED VARIOUS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS. YEAH WE HAVE VARIOUS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS -- I SEE IN THE LA OWES RIDE UP THE TWO OF THEM GOT PULLED OUT AS WHAT THEY ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH US THAT ARE PURELY TECHNICAL AND THAT WAS. THAT SOME CONVERSION OF CAN HELP TELL A PERMANENT POSITIONS. AND ALSO THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH OUR POSITION REDUCTION DUE TO THE CALIFORNIA MILK MARKETING ORDER MOVING OVER TO THE FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDER. I'LL JUST NOTE ON THAT ONE THOUGH. IT WASN'T A REDUCTION TO ZERO AS A REDUCTION TO FIVE BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A SMALL PROGRAM. THAT PERFORMS A SERVICE FOR THE CALIFORNIA AIR INDUSTRY AND THAT'S OPERATING THE WHAT'S CALLED THE QUOTA IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM [inaudible] OKAY. I'M MOVING ON TO THE ONES THAT WERE PULLED OUT -- FOR SCRUTINY I GUESS YOU COULD SAY. THE FIRST ONE UP IS MOUNTAIN PASS BORDER PROTECTION STATION OPERATION EXPANSIONS. AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN EIGHT POSITIONS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING. WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS HELP US TO OPEN UP ADDITIONAL LANES AT MOUNTAIN PASS BORDER PROTECT? CIVILITY THAT'S A RELATIVELY NEW FACILITY I A REPLACED AN OLDER FACILITY THAT WAS VERY AN ADEQUATE AND IT'S A MUCH LARGER FACILITY. AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE'VE OPERATED IF WITH THE EXISTING OPERATIONS STAFF THAT WE HAD THAT THAT'S NOT AN ADDED ADEQUATE TO KEEP THE LANES OPEN. OR IDEALLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY ON ALL LANES BUT WE REALIZED THAT YOU REALLY DON'T NEED THAT -- WE TRY TO KEEP ALL LANES OPEN DURING WHAT WE ANTICIPATE TO BE HEAVY PEAK PERIODS. BUT WILL WERE NOTICING AS IS THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHERE WE JUST. TO KEEP SOME LANES OPENED FOR ADDITIONAL HOURS. AND SO IT'S JUST BECOME A MANAGEMENT -- IT SURE CHALLENGE FOR US TO PLACE PEOPLE ON SHIPS AT TIMES -- WE KNOW THE TRAFFIC'S GOING TO BE PEAK AND WE THINK THAT THESE EIGHT POSITIONS AN EXTRA MONEY WILL HELP US TO BETTER MANAGE THAT SITUATION. TWO THINGS WE WANT TO AVOID WANT AVOID THE BACK UPS. BECAUSE A BACK UP TO A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE BUT ALSO WITH THE BACKUP TO DO OVER TIME IS IS IT IN SENSE. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO JUST GET AROUND AND NOT EXPERIENCE THAT BACK UP TO TRY TO BY PASS THAT STATION. AND THEN THE DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING THE STATE FORM THE INSPECTIONS THAT WE NEED TO DO. OR WHEN CHP SAYS PUBLIC SAFETY YEAH WERE VERY SENSITIVE IS THAT LIKE SAFETY ISSUE -- WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY TELL US THAT WE JUST HAVE TO START WAVING ALL TRAFFIC THROUGH WHICH THEIR AGAIN COMPROMISE OUR ABILITY TO DO A PROPER INSPECTION? ALL RIGHT IN EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFF MEMBER THIS IS SAID AT A CHALLENGED. SPOT ON THE I'VE. FIFTEEN IT IS THE BEST A CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN THERE IS INCREASED QUITE A BIT. WE GET OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION VEHICLES IN A THOUSAND BOTH SAID TRAVEL THROUGH THERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LAST QUARTER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN LOOKING AT NUMBERS THERE. THOUGH IT GETS AN UNUSUAL LOT OF TRAFFIC AND I MENTION BOATS. WATER MUSCLE INSPECTIONS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE THERE. SO THESEINSPECTIONS A LOT MORE THAN JUST LOOK FOR BUGS EVERYBODY ALLS ON THE BUG STATIONS BUT WE PERFORM A LOT OF WORK FOR OTHER AGENCIES AT THESE. OR PROTECTION STATIONS AS WELL. WE HAVE. YEAH WELL AS A CROSS STATE LINES SOME OF THE BOATS HAVE THOSE BART PARTICLES. YEAH C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; THE MUSCLES.&lt;/c&gt;</u> YES HE BROWN C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; THE MUSCLES&lt;/c&gt;</u> ARE PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY COULD BE EASILY TRANSPORTED ON BOATS THAT -- RECREATIONAL BOATS COMING IN FROM OTHER STATES STATES SPECIALLY FROM ARIZONA. OKAY LET'S AS FOR THE LA ELSE COMMENT ON I GUESS TO BE TWENTY SEVEN A ON THE MOUNTAIN PASS BORDER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE US COMMENTED BALLOT. THAT TECHNICAL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IN GENERAL AS NOTED EARLIER. WITHOUT THAT ONLY TO THE THESE PROPOSALS ARE ACTUALLY TECHNICAL IN NATURE. THAT THE OTHER -- FIVE IT'D A FULL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WHEN WE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY FORTHCOMING IN COOPERATIVE AS HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THE LESS WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ON ON THESE PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECEIVE INFORMATION. PARTICULARLY IN CASES WHERE IT'S FUNDING FOR NEW ACTIVITIES PROPOSING NEW POSITIONS OR EXTENSION OF FUNDING ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE SOMETIMES THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED POSITIONS ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS WITH THE IDEA THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL COME BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER. AND WE'LL GET AN UPDATE ON THEIR PROGRESS TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING THAT PROGRAM BEFORE THEY APPROVE THOSE POSITIONS ON A PERMANENT BASIS. SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION PART APPROVING THE BUDGET PROPOSALS AND ALSO. ASKED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE FUTURE -- PROVIDE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS WHEN. AND ALSO I FINING ACTIVITIES AND THEIR POSITIONS AT THE LEGISLATURE PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED ON THE ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS THAT SORT OF COVERS OUR OUR OVERARCHING CONCERN WE'RE NOT RAISING ISSUES WITH ANY OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS. OKAY. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THIS IS TWENTY SEVEN BE. WE'RE ASKING FOR NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND A DISTRIBUTED MINISTRATION IN ONE POSITION IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND AND ONE POSITION AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AN ON GOING. AND THAT'S TO BEEF UP BASIC. THIRTY AND OVERALL SECURITY IN OUR SYSTEMS AND AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT THAT WE UNDER WENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE MILITARY. WE MOST RECENTLY UNDERWENT ONE TO THEIR STEPPING UP THEIR AUDIT CYCLES WITH ALL STATE AGENCIES AND SO I THINK A POLICY A LOT OF THESE REQUEST FOR EXTRA IT PERSONNEL. TO FOCUS IN ON SECURITY ISSUES. IN THE MIX HOW MUCH OF IT IS THAT THE PHYSICAL -- UPDATE OF EQUIPMENT I GUESS. OF THE NINE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THIS WE'VE GOT THREE THINGS AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME I SHOULD PROBABLY. I CAN GET THAT BREAK DOWN TO YOU LATER HOW MUCH OF THAT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT. OKAY YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY WERE LOOKING AT A WHOLE SUITE OF DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO ENHANCE THE SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEMS [inaudible] OKAY. LET'S MOVE ON THE TWENTY SEVEN SEAT. SPEAK A DEVIL TEST ALTERNATIVES. YEAH. BECAUSE OF THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND AG FUND A STORY IN FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING. THAT'S FOR OUR OFFICE OF PESTICIDE CONSULTATION THE SUPPORT SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL EFFORTS AND TESTING OF ALTERNATIVES FOR PESTICIDES BEING CONSIDERED FOR D. REGISTRATION IN CALIFORNIA. WE DO NOTED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE DO RECEIVE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND AND GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY. TO SUPPORT SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT FOR PESTICIDES. OUR DESPITE THAT AUGMENTATION. THE OFFICE OF PESTICIDE CONSULTATION AND ANALYSIS RETAINS A SHORTFALL IN RESOURCE OF FORTY THAT'S NECESSARY TO FULLY IMPLEMENT PLANS TO DEVELOP PESTICIDE ALTERNATIVES. THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW OP COULD A FUND BETWEEN THREE OR FOUR NEW CALIFORNIA INTER REGIONAL RESEARCH PROJECT NUMBER FOUR PROJECTS A COLUMN I ARE FORCED [inaudible] AND THOSE ARE TARGETED TOWARDS NEW BIOLOGICAL CONTROL PROJECTS EVERY ONE TO THREE YEARS AND ALL THE PROJECT OUTCOMES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE GRANT AGREEMENTS AND VERIFIED BY OUR SCIENTIFIC STAFF. IS IN HOUSE WORK WE HEARD FROM ON THE CITRUS PROPOSAL -- UC IRVINE DOING SOME WORK OBVIOUSLY I SOON DAVIS IS DOING SOME SOME SOME WORK YOU WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY SERVICES JUST. ENTIRELY IN HOUSE. THIS MONEY WOULD PASS THROUGH US AS SO PRIMARILY PROBABLY TWO PEOPLE AT RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE UC SYSTEM AND WE USE OUR SCIENTIFIC STAFF TO VALIDATE THOSE AND ALSO TO PROVIDE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INITIAL SCOPE TO MAKE SURE THAT IS FOCUSED IN ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE [inaudible] OKAY. BUT LET'S MOVE ON TO INDUSTRIAL HEMP. TOM THIS PROPOSAL'S REQUESTING SIX POSITIONS AN ONGOING THERE'S NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS -- THE FUNDING WILL BE AS A RESULT OF ONE OUR REGULATIONS BECOME PUBLISHED AND WE START COLLECTING REGISTRATION FEES FOR REGISTERING PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN GROWING INDUSTRIAL HEMP. AND WHAT TYPE OF A RESPONSE THE THANK YOU CAN TO GET FROM THE COMMUNITY THIS IS GOING TO BE -- WE'VE GOT ON THE THE MEDICAL SIDE WE'VE GOT IN AND INTO CS SIX GROUP OF GROWERS THAT WANT TO A PRODUCER -- BUT THIS CIVIL MARIJUANA. THANKS TO HIM. THIS IS GONNA BE BIG BUSINESS AND YEAH WE'RE HEARING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST FROM COMMERCIAL GROWERS WHO WANT TO ADD THIS INTO THEIR CROP MAX. I'M BOTH OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY A POTENTIAL FOR PROFITABILITY BUT IT DOES WORK ITS WAY INTO A GOOD ROTATIONAL CROP AS WELL. OKAY. I'M LET'S MOVE ON TO TWENTY SEVEN E. THIS IS WORK DANI'S ORGANIC WASTE MANAGEMENT. THIS PROPOSALS FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY IN ONE POSITION FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY THROUGH. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX AND THAT'S TO ADMINISTER. FUNCTIONS RELATED OUR DEPARTMENT FROM CHAPTER SIX THIRTY THREE STATUTES OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS. EIGHTY NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IT REQUIRES CAL EPA TO COURTNEY WAS SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING OUR CDFA TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES. TO AID AND DIVERTING ORGANIC WASTE FROM LANDFILLS BY PROMOTING THE COMPOSTING OF SPECIFIC ORGANIC WASTE BY PROMPTING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF THAT COMPOSTING CALIFORNIA. I KNOW YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN HEALTHY SOILS SO THIS IS. ONE PART OF THAT EFFORT. THE RIGHT THIS IS NOT WITHIN HEALTHY SOILS BUT IT'S ANOTHER AREA THAT ARE DEPARTMENTS ACTIVE IN THAT FEEDS INTO THE OVERALL GOALS OF HEALTHY SOIL. YEAH AND THIS IS JUST THE ADMINISTRATIVE PART OF YET TO ASSIST THE THE FUNDINGFOR THE PROGRAM WORK WITH CALLIE PA SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THESE ORGANIC WASTE MATERIALS THAT ARE GOING INTO LANDFILLS. TO THE POST A BALL THAT WE CAN GET THOSE INTO A COMPOSTING ARRANGEMENT. OKAY KALI SIX IS A I'D ISSUES TWENTY SEVEN A THROUGH D.. IF ANY QUESTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT. IF NOT THE RECOMMENDATION IS THE WHOLE OPEN ON OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING LATER LET'S MOVE ON TO YOUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REQUEST. YEAH THIS PROPOSAL ASKS FOR THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY TO ADDRESS. CRITICAL STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES IN OUR HAWAII FRUIT FLY REARING FACILITY. AND AT OUR PLANT PESTS DIAGNOSTIC CENTER THIS LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO. I'M BASICALLY AT OUR FLEW FROM FIRING FACILITY THERE. FOR MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY WE NEED TO HAVE CLIMATE CONTROL TO BE VERY OPERABLE AND WE CAN'T HOW FLUCTUATIONS IN THE OLD EQUIPMENT IS NOT AS RELIABLE AS IT SHOULD BE. AND IF WE HAVE TO WATER TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS THEN IT. CUTS DOWN ON OUR REARING CAPACITY. AND THAT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF A TECHNIQUE THAT WE USE DOWN IN THE LA BASIN WHERE WE WERE. WE REYES MED FLIES STERILE MED FLIES AND WE RELEASE THEM DOWN IN THE BASIN SO THAT THEY CAN ACT AS MEETING DISRUPTORS THERE. THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE NATURAL STE. IN AND OUT OF OUR PLAID. PLANTAS DIAGNOSTIC LAB. WE'VE INVESTED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS FIXING THE ROOF THERE WAS A AGING ROUGH AND WE GOT ALL THAT FIX BECAUSE WE HAD EXTREME WATER INTRUSION PROBLEMS THERE. AND SO THIS MONEY WILL GO TOWARDS ALL THE THINGS BELOW THE ROOFLINE FOR INSTANCE WE HAD A LOT OF WINDOW ISSUES WHERE WINDOWS FLASHING WAS INADEQUATE WATER WAS COMING IN AND WE HAVE A LOT OF VERY EXPENSIVE AND SENSITIVE LAB EQUIPMENT IN THERE AND WATER INTRUSION. DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR THAT EQUIPMENT. LUCKILY WE GOT IT DONE LAST YEAR BEFORE THE RAINS CAME THIS YEAR WELL YEAH WE'RE STILL GETTING WE STILL HAVE PARTS OF THAT BUILDING THOUGH THAT THAT'S HAPPENING LIKE I SAY WINDOWS DOORS THAT ARE NOT SEALED UP ADEQUATELY AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT'S WHAT THIS MONEY'S GONNA. DO IS ACCOMPLISHED ALL THAT. FINANCE STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THAT WE ADD LANGUAGE TO GIVE NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT. LEGISLATIVE BUDGET. COMMITTEE. THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH EFFORTS ON THAT. BRENT AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IN ANOTHER SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE -- SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE WAS -- PROPOSED -- OF FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- REPORTING DOWNSTREAM SO WE'RE AWARE OF THAT TEN WOULD ONLY ASK THAT THE EFFORT TO BE COORDINATED -- AT THE END OF THE PROCESS. MAKE IT SO WE SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THE S. R. L.. OKAY THIS IS THE FIRST MAINTENANCE IS ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY EIGHT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOMEONE REPORTING TO THE THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. ANYBODY HERE ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OKAY THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION AS AMENDED WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASKING I OWN MY PLANNER MONEY. NOW I NEED TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING ON CALIFORNIA OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. ISSUES THAT WE LEFT OPEN ANYBODY HAVE A GENERAL COMMENT ON ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE LEFT OPEN. WHICH WILL. INCLUDE BIO DIVERSITY AT THE TWENTY SEVEN HE'S. EXCEPT RAP EXCEPT OUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON FURTHER THAN THEM YOU HAVE THE NAME PLAN SOCIETY ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE BY DIVERSE INITIATIVE. VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF OF STAFF RECOMMENDATION LEADING THE ITEM OPEN AND THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR CDFA TO WORK WITH CITY OF W. ANOTHER PARTNERS -- TO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR US TO TO REALLY MOVE FORWARD ON THE GERM PLASM AND SEE BANKING QUESTION -- C. M. P. S. IS BEEN VERY INVOLVED TO DATE ON ON BEING ABLE TO SEED BANK ABOUT HALF OF THE THE RAREST OF THE RARE. NATIVE PLANTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE BELIEVE WITH AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT -- OF ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS THE THE PROCESSING CATEGORY CATALOGING OF ALL OF OUR AROUND REYES PLANS IN CALIFORNIA. TO IT TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ENSURE. THAT WE CAN PREVENT PLANT EXTINCTION A A STATE -- AND LIKELY WITHIN TWO YEARS -- TIME IF THE FUNDING IS MADE AVAILABLE -- AND TO DATE THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE THE NGO COMMUNITY UNIVERSITIES -- AS WELL AS WITH STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP FOR FUNDING -- SO WITH THAT -- LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WITH WITH EVERYBODY ON THIS ISSUE -- AND THANK YOU ALL FOR THE FOR THE TIME TO THE COMMON. THANK YOU. THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- DOUG JOHNSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA INVASIVE PLANT COUNCIL WE'RE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS. BOTH PLOT PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LAND MANAGERS ACROSS STATE WORKING TO PROTECT THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENT ECONOMY. AND WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE THREE OF FOR INVASIVE PLANT MANAGEMENT OR THE NOXIOUS WEED MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT. IN THIS A B. C. P. IT'S CRITICAL INVESTMENT IN THE STATE'S NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE BY WHICH I MEAN THE BIODIVERSITY. THE AGRICULTURE BUT ALSO FIRE PROTECTION. AND WATER RESOURCES SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT -- MOVING THIS BUDGET ITEM FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MATTEO CROWN BEHALF THE PENINSULA OPEN SPACE TRUST AND SANTA CLARA VALLEY OPEN SPACE IT'S ALREADY ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE ITEM TWENTY FIVE THE BIODIVERSITY INITIATIVE AND LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. PARTMINER FAST FOOD THAT CULTURE WE WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. AND MOVE ON TO TODAY'S MAIN EVENT BE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY NINE THIS IS THE CITY FOR AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. BUDGET CHAIN PROPOSED BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THIS IS I ASKED THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD THE COME BACK AND JOIN THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. DEPARTMENT. COMES BACK THIS. IS THIS THIS IS A WHOLE MESS OF WHO WOULD LIKE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN. I CAN OKAY. REVENUE CHAIR WERE CUT Y. CASKEY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I HAVE WITH ME TODAY -- DERREN PLANUS OUR DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER. AS YOU KNOW IN TWENTY TWELVE THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE WHICH ESTABLISHED CALIFORNIA'S HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER POLICY. THAT POLICY CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY STATES. EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS A RIGHT TO SAFE CLEAN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE WATER ADEQUATE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THE DIVISION A DRINKING WATER IS COMING OUT. WE HAVE MADE COME OVER TO THE OUR STATE WATER BOARD WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THIS REGARD. THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADDITIONALLY PROVIDED THE BOARD WITH PNEUMOTHORACES AS WELL. ADDRESS SAFE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS -- THAT INCLUDED. PROP ONE CAPITAL FUNDING FOR DRINKING WATER AND WASTE WATER TREATMENTS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE ABILITY TO USE THOSE DOLLARS. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL. AND ALSO CREATE A ALSO INCLUDED THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE O SUSTAINABLE WATER SOLUTIONS TO FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THEIR NEEDS. ALONG WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER CONSOLIDATION OF SMALL SYSTEMS WITH LARGER SYSTEMS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE CREATION OF NEW SMALLER SYSTEMS. INCLUDED THE ABILITY TO HELP PROVIDE DRINKING WATER ASSISTANCE TO SMALL COMMUNITIES AND DOMESTIC WELL OWNERS IN CERTAIN CASES. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO DROUGHT. AND AS YOU ALSO GAVE US THE ABILITY LIMITED FUNDING TO HIRE AN ADMINISTRATOR TO MANAGE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. SIMPLY LACK MANAGERIAL FINANCIAL OR TECHNICAL SKILLS TO MANAGE WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES. THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP MANY COMMUNITIES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HELPING MANY MORE. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE BOARD HAS BROUGHT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS ARE FAILING. TO DELIVER SAFE DRINKING WATER BACK INTO COMPLIANCE. TAKING ACTIONS AND PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAS LED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF A TOTAL NINETY SIX FAILING SYSTEMS. WERE LIKELY TO FILL WATER SYSTEM SINCE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WE'VE HELPED OVER TWO HUNDRED SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SECURE FUNDING FOR PROJECT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION TO OUR OFFICE IS STABLE WATER SOLUTIONS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS MANY LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE PARTICULAR THOSE SERVING SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. WITH NEARLY THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS OVER THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS AT THIS POINT UNDER OUR JURISDICTION THE JUST CAN'T CONSISTENTLY MEET STANDARDS. AND UNTOLD ANYMORE THERE ARE TOO SMALL TO BE RAY. WE ALSO OF UNTOLD THOUSANDS OF DOMESTIC WELLS THE BOTTOM LINE. IS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP THOUSANDS MORE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN AND WE COULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY. BUT OVER MILLION OVER A MILLION CALIFORNIANS STILL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. WHICH TO MANY OF US IS THE PREEMINENT WATER ISSUE OF OUR TIME. WHEN THAT WE HAVE CALIFORNIANS? WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. THE LAST REMAINING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE FOR ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER IS TO PROVIDE. A STABLE FUNDING. BURKE STABLE FUNDING FOR LONG TERM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR DRINKING WATER SYSTEM. AS WOULD BE ESTABLISHED AND REPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THIS IS AN REQUEST A FIRST RESORT. NOR IS IT A WAIT INDEFINITELY PROP UP UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS. INSTEAD THE FUND IS THE KEYSTONE TO A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THIS STATE HAS THOUGHTFULLY PIECE TOGETHER OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WHICH INCLUDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. CONSOLIDATION REGIONALIZATION CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE IT IS A BORED INTEND TO USE THIS MONEY EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THE BOARD INTENDS TO FIRST USE THESE FUNDS ALONG WITH OTHER TOOLS LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDED. TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE FAILING SYSTEMS BEFORE CONSIDERING FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SOLELY. IN MANY CASES FOR MAY FIRST THE POINT OPERATE AND MANAGE A FAILING SYSTEM BEFORE CONSIDERING PROVIDING. FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. AND WHILE THE CHALLENGE OF ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER MIGHT SEEM TO SOME AS A RULE ISSUE IT'S A PROBLEM THAT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS AN URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL PROBLEM THE SOLUTIONS NEED AND NEEDS ARE UNIQUE TO EACH COMMUNITY THAT IS FACING THESE CHALLENGES. I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS DIRECTLY THE CONCERN THAT I'VE HEARD FROM SOME. OF THE WATER FREE PROPOSED IN THE TRAILER BILL WOULD NOT COULD DIRECTLY BENEFIT COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. OF CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE. OR THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS. AND AS CALIFORNIANS WE ALL PAY FOR A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES EVEN THOUGH SOME GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT SOME COMMUNITIES MORE THAN OTHERS. DOES THIS PEOPLE ROLL PARTS OF THE STATE HELP PAY FOR STORM WATER PROJECTS A PRIMARILY BENEFIT URBAN AREAS. IT IS JUST AS REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. TO CONTRIBUTE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT YET HAVE ACCESS. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A NEW SPECIAL FUND. FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGED AND PAYING FOR SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM COST OF ATTAINING ACCESS. ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING STATUTORY LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A PROGRAM PROVIDE GRANTS LOANS AND ADMINISTRATOR CONTRACTS ARE SERVICES. TO ASSIST A LITTLE COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS IN SECURING THAT ACCESS. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES WILL FUND THE STATE BOARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. TO TAKE INITIAL STEPS TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW PROGRAM INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING FEEDING COLLECTION SYSTEMS. ADOPTION OF AN ANNUAL IMPLEMENTATION IN PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A MESS A MAP RATHER OF HIGH RISK AQUIFER'S. USED AS DRINKING WATER SOURCES. THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE FOOD NAG WHEN THE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE THE DAIRY AND FARMERS AND RANCHERS THE THAT PART OF THE A PROPOSAL. YEAH OUT THERE'S THREE MAIN COMPONENTS AND THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR FEE COLLECTION -- ONE OF THEM IS ON JERRY PRODUCTION. AND AS I MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER COMPONENT OF THIS HEARING WERE ALREADY INVOLVED IN THAT SO WE WOULD JUST HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT WOULD HELP US COLLECT THE FEES NECESSARY THAT'S CONTAINED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND THEN ALSO TO COLLECT A FEE ON FERTILIZER IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE AGAIN WE ALREADY DO SOME WORK IN THAT AREA AND COLLECT WHAT'S CALLED A MILL FEE THERE. AND SO WE WOULD JUST ADD EXISTING STAFF AND DO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FRONT DATABASE WORK TO HELP US DO THAT. THE CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATION FEE THAT'S BEEN PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGES AS YET UNSPECIFIED. BUT WE WOULD AS THE LANGUAGE STATES WE WOULD EXPERTISE TO FACILITATE THAT SO THAT WE COULD DETERMINE WHAT THOSE FEES SHOULD BE AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE APPLIED [inaudible] OKAY -- HELLO WHAT'S YOUR COMMENT SIMON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF COMMENTS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. A FIRST IS UNCERTAIN EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSE REVENUES WOULD FULLY -- ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT COMPLETED AN ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BRINGING DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO MEET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN THE COMPLIANCE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A STUDY IT WAS -- STARTED LAST FALL HOWEVER. IT'S NOT EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN TELL THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY HOWEVER WE NOTED THAT THE BOARD HAS STATED THAT THEY THINK PARTS OF THE STUDY MAY BE AVAILABLE SOONER. ON IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT STUDY WE MET AT A PRIVATE CONSULTING FIRM ESTIMATED THE TOTAL COST ADDRESSING INTIMIDATED DRINKING WATER. AT ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION HOWEVER THIS THIS ESTIMATE IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN GIVEN THE LACK OF DATA ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE NUMBER SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND WELLS THAT FAILED TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER. I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ACTUAL COSTS COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. I GUESS I GUESS ON IT FOR ASKING THE WHOLE PUBLIC TO PAY IN WITH. EXCEPT THE THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ISN'T PART OF IT ON THE COOPERATION THAT WE GET FROM THE SMALL FAILING -- THE DISTRICTS MOVED TO SET ASIDE THE WAY LESSEN FOURTEEN HOT CUPS WHICH WE DON'T HAVE. WHICH IS ANOTHER PROBLEM BUT JUST LOOK AT THE IDENTIFIABLE SMALL SYSTEMS THAT ARE WORKING IF THERE'S MONEY THERE TO CONSOLIDATE. OR TO OR TO JOIN THE SYSTEM IF THERE COOPERATIVE OF THAT IT'S GOT A SAVE MONEY RIGHT I MEAN. IF THEY WANT TO FIGHT AS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE SELF DETERMINED AND BUT WHATEVER THEY'VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT. A BIG SWING OF OF HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT WOULD YOU. AGREE WITH THAT. WELL FIRST OF OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHEREVER POSSIBLE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD LOOKS AT OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSOLIDATE WATER SYSTEMS AND IF THAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE -- AND COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH THEN THEY GENERALLY PURSUE THAT. ON AND GENERALLY WE WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY DID -- WHERE THAT IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN? THE QUESTION IS IS THE IS THE SMALL FEELING SYSTEMS THAT SAY OVER MY DEAD BODY YOU'RE NOT WE'RE NOT CONSOLIDATE AND SINCE IS A RELATIVELY NEW TOOL TO GO IN AND TO SAY. NO YOU WILL AND IF THAT BECOMES A LEGAL CHALLENGES DAY I CAN IMAGINE THE PRICE GOING UP VERSUS WE DON'T HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL WE DON'T HAVE THE DOUGH WE ARE WE DISAGREE THAT WERE FAILING. AT THE END OF HìNH INTERESTING POINT -- BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE SOME OF THIS BALL GAME VERSUS JUST WATER IN AG PEOPLE. SO I CAN. THAT'S AN UNCERTAINTY WILL NEVER KNOW RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS. HOW MUCH COOPERATION WE GET -- WHEN A FOR ALL IN UNDER THE -- THE PROPOSAL GO ON WITH YOUR COMMENTS I'M SORRY. AND ANOTHER POINT THAT WE MADE IS THAT THAT THE MASTER THE CHARGE PAIRS WOULD NOT BE. DIRECT BENEFICIARIES THE PROGRAM MEANING THAT THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE PEOPLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE SERVER BY SMALLER WATER SYSTEMS. I'M. THE LARGEST SHARE THE PROGRAM COSTS HOWEVER WOULD BE PAID BY WATER SYSTEM RATE PAYERS ACROSS THE STATE MANY OF HIM OUR CUSTOMERS OF LARGE WATER SYSTEMS THAT ALREADY. PROVIDE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER THERE'S FOR THOSE SYSTEMS WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE PROGRAM. AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE RATE PAYERS IS THERE ALREADY RECEIVING THAT THAT AND THAT HOWEVER THEY BE PAYING FOR GENERALLY THE BULK OF THE COSTS AND THEREFORE THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. AS THEIR WATER SYSTEMS WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR FUNDING FROM IT HOWEVER THERE WOULD BE THE INDIRECT BENEFIT OF THOSE PEOPLE WHEN THEY TRAVEL TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OR THEY STAY IN PLACES THAT ARE BENEFITING DIRECTLY FROM THE PROGRAMMING. HAVING BETTER ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. ANOTHER POINT THAT WE WANTED TO RAISE IS THAT. POSTED THE CHARGE PAIRS WOULD NOT BE AT FAULT FOR THE CONTAMINATION IT'S BEING MEDICATED -- THE VAST MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NITRATE CONTAMINATION IS CAUSED BY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS IN ANIMAL OPERATIONS SUCH AS DAIRY -- COVERAGE WITH NOTHING AT SOME OF THAT THE CURRENT NITRIC CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER THEY'RE NOT FROM THE CURRENT AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS IS THAT SOME OF THESE NITRATES ARE FROM. LEGACY CONTAMINATION THEY COULD BE FROM AS MUCH AS DECADES AGO. WE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES TO SEE IF WE COULD IDENTIFY AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE WE THINK GENERAL FUND. IS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE TO FUND THIS PROGRAM HOWEVER WE ALSO NOTE THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS CAN HEATING FOR SCARCE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES AND IF THAT WAS CHOSEN A FUNDING MECHANISM THIS PROGRAM WILL CONSTANTLY BE IN COMPETITION WITH THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS FOR THAT GENERAL FUND. THIS IS GOING TO PROGRAM WE CREATE AND ON TO A FOR FINDING ON BECAUSE IT WOULD BE PROVIDING THE SAFE DRINKING WATER IF YOU THAT FINDING DECREASED THAT COULD POTENTIALLY PUT THAT SAFE DRINKING WATER AT RISK. ON YOUR PART. WITH THE NITRATES. A WORKING MODEL SEEMS TO BE A SEVENTY THIRTY SPLIT ON WHAT IS A LOT OF TOWARDS NITRATES IN AGRICULTURE WHETHER IT'S A LEGACY HERE I'M GOING. TO DISAGREE WITH THAT THE VISION OR THAT CALCULATION. WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT CALCULATION WE JUST THINK THERE'S CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT IT ON AND THAT WAS PART I'VE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE. THAT WAS DONE BY THE PRIVATE CONSULTING FIRM AND I WAS PART OF THEIR ESTIMATE SO I THINK THERE'S THERE'S JUST UNCERTAINTY THERE. SO WE ALSO LEFT IN TERMS OF ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES AT BOND FUNDING BUT WE DON'T THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE BECAUSE TYPICALLY IT'S USED FOR A ONE TIME PROJECTS. AND THIS WOULD REQUIRE ONGOING FUNDING AND ALSO -- WE LOOKED AT SPECIAL FUNDS -- THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE FUNDS AND WE WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY OF THE SPECIAL FUNDS AS AN OPTION. AND THEN FINALLY THE WE WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS WOULD AFFECT ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS INVOLVE SOME POLICY TRADE OFFS COMPARED TO THE STATE'S CURRENT ENFORCEMENT APPROACH. ON THE ONE HAND THE PROPOSAL IS STRUCTURED TO BETTER ENSURE THAT A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR WATER QUALITY MITIGATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. RATHER THAN T. THAN LIMITED TO JUST CERTAIN AREAS IN THE STATE. SPECIFICALLY FOR NITRATES AND THE PROPOSAL IS THAT AS THE STATE WOULD RELINQUISH SOME OF ITS AUTHORITY -- TO TAKE CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT ACTION SUCH AS CLEAN UP AN ABATEMENT ORDERS AGAINST POLLUTERS IF THERE OTHERWISE COMPLYING WITH THEIR APPLICABLE PERMITS IN WAIVERS AND I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. THE AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE I PAINS CHARGES INTO THE FINE SAID THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE BEST PRACTICES GOING FORWARD I WAS PART OF A STUDY GROUP RECESSION THE WENT TO INDIA AND WE WE HAD HAD A MEETING WITH. AN INDIAN FERTILIZER COMPANY THAT WAS GOING -- TO ALL ORGANICS THEY WERE GOING AWAY FROM PETROLEUM BASE I TREATING GOING TO YOU KNOW A MORE HEALTHY SOIL WE TALKED ABOUT THAT PREVIOUSLY SO SO WELL THAT'S NOT BEFORE AS IF THE BEST PRACTICES CHAIN SO THAT WE'RE NOT. CONTINUE TO USE THE PER. THE EXCESSIVE NITRATES IN IN IN THE SOIL. THEN THAT MAY BE A SELF CORRECTING THE NOMINAL AGAIN THAT'S MORE. AG THEN WATER RESOURCE POOR BUT THE THE PROGRAM BENEFITS I MEAN IF WE IF. IF CALIFORNIA CHOOSE THE GO DOWN THAT PATH [inaudible] ALRIGHT COME. CALLING SENATOR. MINING SURPRISINGLY YOU HAVE A QUESTION ON THIS. THE FOR TO THE DIRECTOR AND SEE IF YOU HAD ANY RESPONSES TO THAT LA -- COMMENTS FROM. PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF EXPLORING OTHER [inaudible] FUNDING OPTIONS. OTHER FUNDING OTHER FUNDING OPTIONS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AS YOU WILL NOTE CENTER MINING YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S TAKINGUP THIS ISSUE. AND WHAT WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH IS THAT IT HAS TO BE A A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF FUNDING FOR FOR THE SYSTEMS TRANSITION AIR. TRANSACTION YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE IN TRANSITION OR WILL HAVE TO BE FOR OUR HOWEVER LONG. YOU CAN'T JUST. CUT OFFS AN ARBITRARILY OR OR HAVE FLUCTUATING. THE FUND BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE AGAIN THAT CONSISTENT. ABLE FUNDING THAT THEY CAN COME FROM IT AND SO -- IN THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY INSOFAR AS WE'VE SPENT. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CAPITAL FUNDING -- FROM THE STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS AND AND OTHER SOURCES BOND SIX CETERA INTO THESE COMMUNITIES. BUT AGAIN IT'S THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COMPONENT IN SUBJECT TO ABILITY PREDICTABILITY IT'S GONNA BE VERY CRITICAL TO THE PROGRAM THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. AND YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY OF THESE. ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS WOULD. WOULD BE CANDIDATES FOR CONSOLIDATION WITH THE CLEAN WATER. SOURCE -- ALL DEFERRED TO DURABLE HE MISSED BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO REGIONALIZATION CONSOLIDATION IT'S PRETTY MUCH OUR PRIMARY TOOL WE HAVE TO AS DARREN IN ALWAYS POINTS OUT. 95% OF OUR VIOLATIONS COME FROM SYSTEMS UNDER FIVE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS SO THERE'S A DIRECT ISSUE HERE WITH. THE REPAIR BAY SIZE IN YOUR ABILITY TO SERVE CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. SO -- SO WHEN IT COMES TO OF THOSE THREE HUNDRED OR SO I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER BUT I ALL ALLOWED DARRON TO TO MAYBE IF IN CASE HE HAS A BETTER IDEA. OF YEAH AND I REALIZE IT MAY BE AN ESTIMATE I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A TEST SO OUR OUR ESTIMATES ARE GOING INTO THIS JUST LOOKING A CONSOLIDATION. AMONG ALL OF MY POINT AND SECOND ARM WERE WERE RANGING AND SO WE WE DID VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES BASED ON DISTANCE FROM A LARGER WATER SYSTEMS AND WHATNOT SO IT'S IT'S CRUDE -- BUT IT WAS LITERALLY BETWEEN A QUARTER AND WERE AVAILABLE FOR CONSOLIDATION JUST FROM KIND OF A CURSORY REVIEW. OUT WHAT'S MISSING AND WHAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP FURTHER AS SOME OTHER TOOLS ASSOCIATE WITH. REGIONALIZATION THEY MAY NOT REALLY BE TING PHYSICALLY BUT WE NEED TO PUT SMALL SYSTEMS TOGETHER UNDER ONE MANAGER UNDER ONE BUILDING SYSTEM UNDER. ONE PROFESSIONAL KIND A GROUP AND THEN JOIN THEM TOGETHER AND THAT WAY TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITION SEES WHICH WOULD BE ANOTHER FORMER CONSOLIDATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CAN WE TOUCH ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE STATE OR UNDER THE JURISDICTION THE SMALL WELLS THE PEOPLE AT LESS THAN. FOURTEEN HOOK UPS AND ALL OF THOSE -- SORT OF LIKE ELAINE ALLERGIES I I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME. HOMES OR SOME PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARELIVING THAT ARE TOO FAR GONE. THAT THE WELL WAS CONTAMINATED THE SEPTIC IS CONTAMINATE THE WELL IT WAS IN A NATURALLY OCCURRING ARSENIC. BE SEN IT'S JUST SOMEBODY BUILT A HOUSE THERE ONCE UPON A TIME AND CALLS AT HOME BUT FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW FROM OF PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER. IT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOUR SOUL REMOTE REMOVE FROM. OTHER FUNCTIONING -- SYSTEMS [inaudible] THAT'S BETTER. NOT OUR WATER RESOURCE OR NAG A QUESTION IT'S IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS. THEY'VE. BEEN HERE AT THE SEVERAL COMMITTEES ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHT AND EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO TO WATER AND I'M CONCERNED WITH SOME PEOPLE EXPECTING I'M GONNA STAND MY GROUND. AND YOU WILL CLEAN THIS UP IN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING A LOT HERE BUT THERE ARE SOME TOOLS WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO AT LEAST STATE. JURISDICTION OVER THE SMALL OF FACILITIES. INDEPENDENT FACILITIES I GUESS. HAS GIVEN ME ADD ONE THING THERE I THINK YOU WOULD FIND IT THERE'S A SURPRISING NUMBER OF PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELLS IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF EXISTING WATER SYSTEMS IT'S BEEN A BIG SURPRISE MINE AS WELL. A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON IS HAVING THOSE PEOPLE HAVE THE OPTION TO VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATE WITH THAT LARGER WATER SYSTEM IT'S NOT A BIG STRETCH. BATTLE CAPTURE A LOT OF THEM YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE SO REMOTE THAT THE QUESTION. BEGS ITSELF AS TO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH. THOUSAND AND THAT'S NOT THERE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WE CAN HELP VERY CLOSE TO COMMUNITIES NOW THAT'S GOOD NEWS I DIDN'T. TO HEAR THAT THERE'S THERE'S INDEPENDENT WELLS ALRIGHT LET'S OPEN UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER AND THE WELCOME MISTER CHAIR -- IT'S INSPIRING AND NECESSARY THAT YOU ALL TAKEN THIS LEADERSHIP POSITION AND CALL YOU IN THE GOVERNOR. FOR I JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FORCING US TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS THIS YEAR -- WE WE KNOW WE HAVE -- TO THERE'S A LOT OF WHAT OTHER CHALLENGES OFTEN WATER WRIT LARGE -- BUT THIS IS THE COUPLE TECHNICAL QUESTION JUST FOLLOWING UP ON SOME OF THE THINGS YOU REYES IN TERMS OF THIS PARTIAL PARTIALS MEN. IT WAS A SENSE LIKE WHAT NUGGETS MIGHT EMERGE BEFORE WE HAVE. TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND THIS AND THEN. ON THE CAN FIND ANIMALS FEE I KNOW THAT THAT WAS STILL OUTSTANDING AT THE TIME. EXACTLY HOW THAT SHOULD THAT CHARGE WOULD WORK ANY MORE CLARITY THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO ADD MORE INFORMATION INTO THE POT FOR US. TO HELP MAKE SOME GOOD DECISIONS AND GET I'LL TAKE I'LL TAKE A FIRST CRACK AT THAT AND AND THEN PASS IT ON TO DERREN WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEED TO SUFFER SO. TAKING A STEP BACK WE AT THE STATE WATER BOARD REGULATE SOMETHING AROUND. WHERE WE? THIRTY YES THREE THOUSAND COMMITTEE SYSTEMS AND BUT THERE ARE STILL YET AS AS A CHAIR MENTIONED TO SOME THAT ARE BEFORE BELOW FIFTEEN CONNECTIONS OR FOLKS ARE DOMESTIC WELLS. ONCE WE REGULATE WE KNOW QUITE A BIT ABOUT WE HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT THE NEED IS THE WHAT WHERE WE NEED TO DODD THAT THE FUNDING NEEDS. AND WHERE WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE I MEAN JUST COMPLIANCE SERVE OUR BIG BLINKING RED LIGHTS YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A SYSTEM IN NEED BUT THERE ARE. SO MANY OTHERS THAT ARE MAYBE A YEAR. TWO YOU KNOW A PUMP FAILURE AWAY FROM FROM BEING IN THAT CATEGORY AS WELL NONETHELESS SO WE HAVE THAT PART WE NOTE WE UNDERSTAND QUITE A BIT. IN THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS REALLY SUPPOSED TO FILL IN RULES AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE DOMESTIC WELLS KIND OF COMPLETE THE PICTURE OF THE THE THE THE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT NEEDS AN AND OTHERWISE AND SO. I THINK THE PARENTS TIMELINE -- THAT BIGGER NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS ABOUT A TWO YEAR TIME WINDOW AS THE LA -- I THINK INDICATED. BUT OF THOSE ENTITIES WE ALREADY REGULATE I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY OPPORTUNITY. TO GET MORE INFORMATION OUT HELP YOU KNOW STAR TREK TAKE YOU LATE WHAT THIS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS LIKE THE PEOPLE GET GREATER CERTAINTY I THINK RUN THE PROGRAM. ON THE FEES ALSO TO DEFER TO DARREN I THINK ON THAT THERE AND YOU CAN GIVE A PIECE OF IT WILL GO TO KEVIN ACT THE WITH THAT. OKAY YEAH THE CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS THE CURRENT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT. INSTRUCTS US TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP AND TO EXAMINE WHAT THE PROPER FEE LEVELS SHOULD BE BASED ON WHAT'S OUT THERE WHAT TYPES OF OPERATIONS AND WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED. AND SO WHAT WE ENVISION WITHOUT LANGUAGE HOW WE WOULD WORK WITH IT AS WOULD WORK VERY CLOSELY% WITH THE WATER BOARD. AND FIND OUT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO GO OUT THERE IN RETREAT THE WHEEL AS FAR AS TRYING TO IDENTIFY DEFINITIONS OR THINGS LIKE THAT. AND SO YEAH WE WOULD DEFINITELY COLLABORATE AND THEN MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WORKING GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT IS REFLECTED IN OUR WROTE BUDGET REQUEST FOR SOME POSITIONS TO HELP US DO THAT. ACTUALLY BOTH THE INTEL WIDI UNTIL WE GET TO THE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE TILL WE GET TO THE TO FEES CHARGED WE CAN'T. BEGIN TO SPECULATE ON WHAT THE REVENUE ESTIMATE WOULD BE WE DO HAVE REVENUE ESTIMATES ON THE OTHER TWO COMPONENTS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT -- THE DERRY FEES WE ESTIMATE TO BE ABOUT FIVE TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND FERTILIZER SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WELL THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY IT WOULD BE BASED ON A WORKING GROUP IS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE OPERATIONS. HELLO WHERE THOSE OPERATIONS ARE IN THEY ARE. AND THEN BEGIN TO LOOK AT WHAT A REASONABLE FEE STRUCTURES THAT YOU CAN COLLECT FROM THAT. I KNOW A A IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE IT'S ALL SPECULATION AT THIS POINT SO IT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH A NUMBER -- I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT WOULD THIS IMPACT VERY SMALL MICRO PRODUCERS. I THINK IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE TO SAY THAT WE DON'T LOOK TO THEM AS THE BE THE BACKBONE OF WHO WERE GOING TO COLLECT FEES FROM. AND THEY DON'T REALLY FALL WITHIN ANYBODY'S DEFINITION THAT I'VE SEEN OF A CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATION. THE OF THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THOSE TERMS HAVE MEETINGS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CODE IN AND ALSO WITH AN OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES OF OTHER AGENCIES. I MEAN FROM THE BOARD. OF THINGS WE MIGHT SEE. HELLO MORE TRUNCATED TIMELINE IN THE FULL ASSESSMENT TWO YEARS SO. JOAQUIN OF OF CHEST WILL MENTION THAT CLOSELY IT I THINK IT'S REALLY GONNA BE THE FIRST PART WILL BE THE WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE FAILING AND WE CAN GET AN ESTIMATE OF THOSE THAT'S SO IT'S INFORMATION WE HAVE -- I THINK CALI THE THE PIECE OF WOOD FOLLOW THEN THAT WOULD BE. LOOKING AT IT'S A GOOD BECAUSE IT'LL BE A MODELING EFFORT OF PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELLS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY KNOWN WATER QUALITY ISSUES ARE LIKELY BE IMPACTED THE NEAR FUTURE PROBABLY THE SECOND PIECE THAT WE CAN. DELIVER AND THEN THE LONGER TERM ONE IS ASSESSING WATER SYSTEMS. OF A LOT WORSE ISN'T UNDER OUR REGULATION THAT. MIGHT FAIL BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY A SUBJECTIVE REVIEW IN TIME TO DO THAT. A HOME IN A IN A FASHION AND THEN EVEN HARDER THAN IS THE STATE'S MALLS THOSE -- FOURTEEN TO FOR CONNECTION SYSTEMS THAT. IT HAS NO INFORMATION ON SO WE'RE JUST GONNA BE VENTURING INTO GETTING THAT FROM THE COUNTIES. TRYING TO PUT ALL OF THAT. INFORMATION BECAUSE I ALMOST GUARANTEE EVERYONE OF THEM HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF INFORMATION ON THOSE SYSTEMS AND PULLING THAT TOGETHER AND TRYING TO TURN THAT INTO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL NOW BEEN A LONG STRANGE. ONE WALKTHROUGH TIMELINE IN ON YOU TO DO THAT. FOR YES SO I THINK -- OUR GOAL FOR THE OF SYSTEMS ARE FAILING WOULD BE AROUND ARM. A PROBABLY EARLY FALL OF THIS YEAR. AND THEN ARM PROBABLY THE WATERS THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE WELLS IS PROBABLY GONNA BE WINNER. OF NEXT YEAR SO THE WINNER OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU'RE SAYING IN THE END THAT'S FOR ALL THE OTHER THREE PIECES OF THAT ALL THE PIECES WERE GONNA TRY TO COMPLETE BEFORE THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND YEAH. BUT THERE'S NO MODELING EXERCISE YOU CAN UNDERTAKE NOW DURING THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION THAT GIVES US ON OUR WE'VE ALREADY STARTED EVERYTHING'S UNDER WAY. AS FAST AS WE CAN GET IT WE DO HAVE SOME CONTRACTS YET TO DO. THE YES SO IT'S STARTED. WE HAD TO WORKSHOPS ALREADY ON TWO FACETS OF THIS WE HAVE ANOTHER WORKSHOP COMING UP. IN MAY THE WILL BE THE COST ESTIMATION PIECE AND THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE. TO GET OUR CONTRACTS OUT AND GET PEOPLE WORKING RIGHT AWAY THE GOAL TO TRY TO GET SOME INFORMATION FOR THE END OF THE SESSION I MEAN NOW YOU WON'T HAVE THEM. FOR THEM SOME PARK PIECES WERE WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEFORE THE END OF THE SESSION BUT WE WILL NOT HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE BY THE END OF THE SESSION. ANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE ON WHAT KIND OF INCREASE WE COULD SEE IN TOTAL NEED HERE I MEAN YOU HAVE IT JUST GENERAL ALL PARKS AT THIS POINT I MEAN. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW? YEAH IT WE DON'T KNOW WE WE KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T WE WE KNOW THE AREA. I GUESS I WOULD SAY THE WAY I WOULD CATCH IT IS WE HAVE. YOU KNOW THAT THE BLUE SKY ESTIMATE THAT WAS DONE PREVIOUSLY LAST YEAR -- USE THE INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW IS SAY OKAY WE'LL WHAT WOULD MAKE THE ESTIMATE. SB NATION BETTER I WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND NOTS THE INFORMATION WE'RE SEEKING NOW TO ADD TO THAT COMPONENTS I REALLY DON'T HAVE A BETTER. ONE THEN THEY'VE ALREADY DONE WITH THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE AND WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE SURPRISED WITH WHAT WE GET YOU KNOW. VERY LAST QUESTION BEING DOES REMISS CHAIR IT JUST. MORE BROADLY HAVE YOU HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING AT SORT OF OVERALL -- IN THEM NEEDS WE DO A LOT OF BOND EXPENDITURES HERE BUT JUST IN GENERAL THIS SORT OF OUTSTANDING NEEDED IN. ALL OUR WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS WITHIN UNDER YOUR JURISDICTION OF YOU ALL BEEN SORT OF WHILE YOU'RE TRYING. TO HONE IN ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS ALL FOR THESE VERY SMALL OUTLYING COMMUNITIES YEAH WE WE SORT OF LOOKING AT THE BROADER. THEY GIVE ALL THE ALL THE FUNDS IF EVER REVOLVING YOU KNOW FOR THE ROVING LOANS AND ALL THE GROUNDWATER CLEANUP MONEY THEY WERE MOVING THROUGH THESE BONDS DO YOU DO A GENERAL SENSE AND MAYBE FOR LA -- AS WELL AS IT IS IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE SORT OF TRACKING GENERALLY -- OUTSTANDING OWN M. COSTS FOR OVERALL SYSTEM NEEDS. AT THAT THE LESSON AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND NO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE GENERALLY BEEN TRACKING. WE DON'TWE WE DON'T EVEN WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN [inaudible] ALL THE THINKINGOF ALL THE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE WERE BUILDING PURSUANT. TO THE VARIOUS WATER IN RESOURCES BONDS THAT WE'VE BEEN INVESTING IN OVER THE YEARS AND SO. WHAT OTHER -- IN M. CHARGES WE MAY BE FACING IN THE FUTURE TO DEAL WITH THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN ADDITION OF THIS -- WE TRACK THAT THE BOND EXPENDITURES VERY CLOSELY AND AND WE'VE REPORTED. MANY TIMES ON ON THAT BUT AS FOR THIS SPECIFIC OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS THAT WOULD BE ONGOING THAT ARE RELATED TO THAT CAPITAL. EXPENDITURES FOR THOSE MINES. NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT THERE MAY BE I MAY HAVE OTHER COLLEAGUES AT THE OFFICE THAT ARE WORKING IN THAT AREA. IT'S PRETTY HIGH LEVEL ANALYSIS BUT I THINK BE USEFUL JUST TO GIVE US A SENSE OF CONTACT HERE. FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IN THIS CASE. WHAT ELSE WE GOT ON OUR PLATE? JUST FEEDBACK IN THE FUTURE HERE MISTER YEAH I AM AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW MOST. WATER SPENDING IS LOCAL RIGHT AND I SO IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR US TO KNOW WHAT IS THE OPERATE MISSION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FOR ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE IN ALL THE MANY. WATER UTILITIES AND WHATNOT BUT THAT BEING SAID I THINK THERE AN AD -- MAYBE AT LEAST A PLACE WHERE. THERE MAY BE SOME HELP. SO IT. I'M JUST GONNA READ INTO YOUR OP. BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HANDING OUT THE FUTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO WE DO DO -- AS PART OF THE THE DRINKING WATER SRF IN THE CLEAN WATER SRF A NEEDS ANALYSIS ON A CYCLE WITH U. S. E. P. A. AND THOSE. THOSE NUMBERS PRODUCE. KIND OF A TWENTY YEAR WINDOW OF WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS WE EXPECT. TO BE MADE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE CAN GET THOSE NUMBERS TO I'D I'D HESITATE TO GET HIM OFF TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I KNOW THEY'RE LIKE IN THE SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR RANGE TYPE OF COMPONENT. TO YOU KNOW MAKING HER GO BACK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH LOCAL INVESTMENT THERE'S GOING TO BE IN OUR EXISTING SYSTEMS YEAH. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT THAT SCALE OF ORDER NINETEEN A LOT OF ITS LOCAL BUT ANYHOW THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK FAMILIAR WITH YOU. I THINK IN YOUR OUR CHRIST THANK YOU MISTER THE LEGISLATURE COULD PASS MORE. GOALS JUST KIDDING THANK YOU JURASSIC AROSE AND NOT DEPUTY -- MUST HORROR OUR INTENT IS TO HOLD THE MATTER I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THIS TIME HERE FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THIS IS. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY NINE THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AND THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL AND THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR Y. CASKEY AND MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. ON THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL. WE AGREED WITH THE GOVERNOR AND SENATOR MINING HAS LEGISLATION THIS YEAR IN THIS AREA WE AGREE WITH HIM THAT THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM IN THERE NEEDS TO BE A SOLUTION THIS YEAR. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT ENACTING A WATER TAX. THE WATER TAX IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WAS PROPOSED LAST YEAR THAT WAS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET TRAILER BILL IN THIS ISSUE. AND YOUR CALL THAT THE JOINT ON BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AFFIRMATIVELY REJECTED THE BILL ON IN PART BECAUSE OF THE WATER TAX. ON THE MERITS I'D LIKE TO MAKE QUICK A QUICK POINTS JUST THREE OF THEM. WE THINK IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO TAX SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO LIVE. THAT'S DRINKING WATER THEIR TAP WATER. SECOND THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER TALKS ABOUT A RIGHT TO SAFE DRINKING WATER BUT ALSO WERE RIGHT TO AFFORDABLE WATER. IN THE TAX IN THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS FOR THE TAX WOULD ADD TO THE COST OF WATER AND WORK AGAINST KEEPING WATER AFFORDABLE. SPECIFICALLY ON THE IMPLEMENTATION. THE WAY THIS IS PROPOSED WOULD HAVE THREE THOUSAND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SYSTEMS IMPLEMENT THE TAX. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN MANY OF THOSE INSTANCES THEY WE NEED TO HIRE AT LEAST ONE STAFF PERSON FOR BIG AGENCIES THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN ONE STAFF PERSON. AND THOSE WOULD BE ONGOING COSTS THAT WOULD ADD TO THE COST OF WATER. THERE'S ALSO THE ONE TIME COST OF CHANGING THE INVOICES THAT THE BILLING SYSTEM THE SOFTWARE. WE'VE HEARD NUMBERS ON YOU KNOW FOR ONE SYSTEM IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND IS A COMMON NUMBER YOU HEAR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND I'VE HEARD A CITY SAY THERE'S IT'S NOT MILLION DOLLARS. JUST TO CHANGE THEIR BILLING SYSTEM WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED TAX. THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS SKYROCKET THAT WORKS AGAINST KEEPING WATER AFFORDABLE. IN THE THIRD QUICK POINT IS THAT THE BILL WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT FOR A STATE TAX ON WATER IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE IS A BETTER APPROACH SENATOR CAFIERO IS CARRYING SB SIX SIX NINE IT'S HEADED TO THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE. IT WOULD CREATE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST AND THAT PROPOSAL CAN REPLACE THE PROPOSAL FOR THE WATER TAX. ARE QUIRK IN THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ARE SPONSORING THAT LEGISLATION DECENT I KERN IS HERE ON BEHALF OF SEEING YOU A TO TALK ABOUT THE TRUST. LOSING AQUA WOULD REQUEST THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE REJECT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF THE PROPOSED TAX ON WATER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON I CARD WITH THAT AUSTIN GILBERT ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AND THE ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT -- GIVEN THAT THE ENTIRE ROOM IS STANDING BEHIND ME I'M GONNA TRY AND BE RELATIVELY QUICK -- SEE ANYWAY BUT I I'D ECHO ALL OF OCT WAS COMMENTS. REGARDING THE TAX -- THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE AN OPPOSING LAST MINUTE POSITION ON THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL AS CINDY SAID -- WE DO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL THOUGH THAT WE THINK CAN ADDRESS THIS EXTREMELY SERIOUS ISSUE AND WE ACTUALLY WE SHARE THE GOAL OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. SB SIX SIX NINE CABALLERO IS A IS A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSAL WE HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR. TAKING A PORTION OF THAT BUDGET SURPLUS AS A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION. SETTING ASIDE A TRUST INVESTING THAT MONEY IN USING THE NET REVENUE. TO GET OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE MONEY INTO THESE COMMUNITIES WHERE IT'S NEEDED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO MADE TO MAKE OUR MAINTAINED AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO PEOPLE. IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF WHAT OUR TRUST PROPOSE ONE SB SIX SIX NINE IS. I THINK IT HAS A LOT OF MERIT. NUMBER -- ONE YOU KNOW AS SANDY POINTED OUT THE ATTACKS ON DRINKING WATER IS AT ITS ESSENTIALLY IS A REGRESSIVE TAX THIS IS HARD ON FOLKS. WHO ARE ARE LOWER INCOME WELL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE AT OR BELOW FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE IT? IT'S IT'S AN EXPENSE -- AND SO. USING IT GENERAL FUND SURPLUS MEANS WE'RE USING PROGRESSIVE TAXES INCOME SALES TAX. TO TO ADDRESS THE SAME PROBLEM. THE BIGGEST CRITICISM THAT WE'VE HEARD ON THIS PROPOSAL FRANKLY IS THAT. IN THE GENERAL FUND IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. I I I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT A MAN I WOULD DISAGREE ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS PUT IT ASIDE IT AS A ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS. YOUR STAFF ACTUALLY POINTED OUT IN THE ANALSIS THAT. TAX HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT THE THE FEE WILL ALWAYS BE USED TO FUND PURPOSES INCLUDING IN THIS PROPOSAL. YOU COULD ALSO SAY THE SAME THING. OF SB SIX SIX NINE AND IT'S PROPOSAL FRANKLY OR ANY OTHER PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORWARD. BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT GIVEN THAT. WE WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER TODAY THAT THERE IS A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO SET ASIDE FUNDS TO HELP VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD RESPECT THAT DECISION AND CHOICE GOING FORWARD -- AND AND WOULD NOT USE THOSE FUNDS SAID A LATER DATE SO AGAIN. WE WOULD URGE YOU GUYS TO REJECT THE THAT THE TRAILER BILL AND THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS THEIR DOLPHIN TO HAVE TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA CITIES -- I WOULD LIKE TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH AQUA AND CMU WAY THE LEAGUE OF COURSE BELIEVES IN MAINTAINING HIGH QUALITY DRINKING WATER THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IS ESSENTIAL AND WE SUPPORT THE CREATION OF A STATEWIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND. BUT FEEL THAT PLACING A TAX -- ON WATER IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCE SO WE WOULD REQUEST -- THAT THE TAX BE REMOVED IN ANOTHER FUNDING SOURCE IDENTIFIED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THIS IS YOUR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE PAUL HILL OCCURRED GENERAL MANAGER OF SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT IN EASTERN SACRAMENTO IN WESTERN PLASTER COUNTY -- WE SUPPORT FIXING THE PROBLEM WE THINK YOU NEED TO QUALIFY YOU QUALIFY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS FIRST AS YOUR STAFF REPORT SAID THAT THE WATER WERE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE SOLUTION IS.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION WANT TO BEGIN BY RECOGNIZING THE WORK THAT WAS DETAILED IN THE METRICS DESCRIBED BY CHAIR ASK ABOUT.

THAT SIDES SAID WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S A VERY REAL PROBLEM -- THIS IS A CRISIS THE CALLS FOR COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH -- WE THINK THAT MANY OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL HAVE MERITS FOR EXAMPLE WE SUPPORT A HIGH RISK -- MAPPING ASSESSMENT WE SUPPORT THE CONCERT FEDERAL FUNDING ENFORCEMENT PATH FORWARD WE ALSO APPROACH THE WE ALSO -- SUPPORT GENERALLY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S PROPOSED PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE USED -- TO IT MINISTER FUNDING TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN NEED AND PRIORITIZE FUNDING AMONG THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT SAID WE DO OPPOSE THE PROPOSED FUNDING MECHANISM IN THE FORM OF THE WATER TAX.

OF THE PAIN -- WE DO THINK WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT I WOULD SAY VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY THAT SUPPORTS OUR ORGANIZATION HAVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE. RANKING WATER -- WE DON'T VIEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AS A CONSUMER GOOD WHERE EVERY DOLLAR THAT I PAYING TAXES HAS TO COME BACK TO ME IN TERMS OF A DOLLARS WORTH OF BENEFITS WE THINK THAT PROVIDING SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FOR EVERYBODY DEFINES WHO WE ARE.

HOW WE WON OUT ADDITIONALLY RECOGNIZE THE LEADERSHIP OF BOTH SENATOR MINING AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA AS WELL AS THE LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE WATER BOARD? WE WANT TO PULL OUT -- QUICKLY A COUPLE POINTS ABOUT WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LOOKING. FOR AND ANY PROPOSED SOLUTION THAT ARE ENCOURAGINGLY REFLECTED IN THIS PROPOSED SOLUTION WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SO SUPPORTIVE. FIRST OF ALL THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND WOULD BE A SOLUTION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. URBAN ROLL THOSE THAT ARE SERVED BY A PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM AND THOSE THAT AREN'T LIKE DOMESTIC WELL OWNERS ARSENIC. NITRATE LEAD YOU NAME IT. NO CALIFORNIANS TO GET LEFT OUT THE WAY THAT SOME OTHER COMPETING PROPOSALS SUPPORT. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL MEETS THAT CRITERIA SECOND THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND WOULD PROVIDE TRULY ONGOING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. WE ALL KNOW WHAT OUR BUDGET CYCLE LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A RECESSION HITS. FUNDING FOR ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER SHOULD BE RECESS AND PROOF IT SHOULD BE A PRIVILEGE. THAT IS A AT RISK FOR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS WHEN TIMES GET BAD. THIRTEEN LAST IF ENACTED WILL DRINKING WATER FIND COULD IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IT'S EASY TO LOSE THAT SENSE OF HUMAN CRISIS HERE. ARE COMMUNITIES HAVE TOXIC WATER RIGHT NOW AND THEY'VE HAD IT FOR YEARS IT IS PROPOSAL WERE ENACTED INTO LAW TOMORROW IT WOULD BE A COMPREHENSIVE. FIX IT COULD IMMEDIATELY BEGAN. MAGICAL THINKING REQUIRED HERE OPPONENTS COULD SAY WELL WE CAN SOLVE IT SOME OTHER WAY THEN WHY HAVEN'T WE FOR ALL THESE YEARS. PROPOSALS THAT RELY SOLELY ON THE IDEA OF GETTING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND FUNDING. THOSE BILLS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN HOLLOW WORDS ON A PAGE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. WE ESTIMATE THAT WOULD TAKE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN A TRUST. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK AT AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO. CAME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE OF FIVE BILLION. THAT'S NOT REALISTIC. THIS PROPOSAL IS IT REALISTIC IT'S REAL AND OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT NOR DESERVE TO WAIT FOR PLATITUDES ARE FALSE HOLLOW PROMISES.

SO THAT'S 2100% FEDERAL FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO -- THERE'S AN EXEMPTION IN THERE RIGHT NOW -- THE SECOND ISSUE IS ON SB -- SIX SIX NINE WHILE WE'RE HAPPY THAT -- THERE ARE MANY MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE WANTING TO WORK ON THIS. THAT BILL WOULD ONLY ADDRESS COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS AND LEAVES OUT THOSE WHO ARE NOT SERVED BY COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THERE'S TWO MILLION PRIVATE WELLS IN THIS STATE MANY OF WHICH ARE CONTAMINATED. WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THOSE OUT AND WE WE CAN'T LEAVE THOSE OUT THAT'S NOT THE PROMISE OF THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. AND FINALLY I I JUST WANTED TO THURSDAY WATER BOARDS POINT EARLIER TODAY THIS IS REALLY A CORNERSTONE OF THE LARGER -- PROGRAM SO. IT'S NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE AND INDEED IT'S INTENDED TO SUPPORT PRIORITIZE CONSOLIDATION EXTENSION OF SERVICE. SOURCE PROTECTION ALL OF THOSE THINGS CONTINUE AND ARE PRIORITIZED IN THESE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR THAT.

IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TODAY I WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO WANT TO THANK CENTER MINING -- FOR HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT. THAT THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT WORK DONE IN THIS AND THE BLUE SKY -- STUDY HAS BEEN REFERRED TO A COUPLE TIMES IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES TO TRY TO GET BEYOND -- WHAT IS CURRENTLY REGULATED TODAY AND IT IS REALLY KIND OF A A GOOD PICTURE OF WHAT THAT SCOPE IS? HOW THE NUMBER CAME AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WAS AN IDEA THAT YOU CAN'T? FIX ALL OF THIS AT ONE POINT BUT IF THAT IF YOU CAME AT IT WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSISTENTLY AROUND THE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR RANGE THAT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. COMBINED WITH OTHER EFFORTS LIKE CONSOLIDATION YOU COULD REALLY GET YOUR HANDS AROUND THIS. THE HARDER STUDY FROM UC DAVIS WAS REALLY KIND OF THE PREMISE OF LOOKING AT THE THAT BALANCE OF THAT SEVENTY THIRTY SPLIT ON NITRATE CONTAMINATION AND OTHER NATURAL CONTAMINANTS AND OTHER. POLLUTANTS THAT YOU FIND IN WATER SYSTEMS AND SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SOURCES. CREDIBLE SOURCES -- THAT CAME TOGETHER TO KIND OF PUT THIS COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TOGETHER AND IF YOU GET INTO THE THE WEEDS OF OF THAT TRAILER BILL. THERE ARE OTHER SECURITY MECHANISMS THERE'S AN ANNUAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT BY STAKEHOLDERS THAT WOULD BE A BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THERE'S A CAP. ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE FUN THE COULD BE HELD AT ANY ONE TIME -- SO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT IT NEVER GOT TOO FAR OUT OF CONTROL I MEAN THIS IS A REALLY WELL THOUGHT OUT COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT ULTIMATELY WILL BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF URBAN AREAS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT HAVE ISSUES WITH SAFE DRINKING WATER THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS AS WELL IT'S THE RURAL AREAS THAT ARE GETTING THE ATTENTION. TODAY.
