00:31:44.703 --> 00:31:48.640 region:rollup2
HIGH.

REQUIREMENT.

00:32:17.836 --> 00:32:20.939 region:rollup2
AS IT IS WITH MEDICAL DOCTORS

00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:22.040 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR LICENSE

ACTIVE.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.910 region:rollup2
IF A VETERINARIAN CHOOSES TO

INCORPORATE THE USE OF MEDICAL

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.679 region:rollup2
CANNABIS INTO THEIR PRACTICE IT

00:32:26.378 --> 00:32:29.414 region:rollup2
ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT THEY

SHOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:31.550 region:rollup2

THE ABILITY TO RECOMMEND. THE

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:39.357 region:rollup2
SIMPLY JUST HAD IT SAYS THE

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.393 region:rollup2
VETERINARIANS HAVE FIRST

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:42.494 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

00:32:41.393 --> 00:32:44.830 region:rollup2
ALLOWING CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO BE

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:51.169 region:rollup2
NO DOUBT. BUT THERE'S NO SAFETY

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:52.404 region:rollup2

DOCTOR.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.984 region:rollup2
THE EASY ANSWER IS TO ALLOW THAT

00:33:03.782 --> 00:33:06.885 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS IN RECREATIONAL OUTLETS

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:08.653 region:rollup2

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:10.655 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD MAKE THE PROBLEM

00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:12.123 region:rollup2
WORSE.

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:14.226 region:rollup2

FOR A BODY OF EVIDENCE TO DRIVE

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:24.803 region:rollup2

00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:26.771 region:rollup2
ARE ALWAYS A I ASK FOR AND

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:28.139 region:rollup2

WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T SPEAK FOR

THIS LEGISLATURE AND A LONG

00:41:36.728 --> 00:41:40.698 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF NOT ACTING IN THE

SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BILL BE

HELD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:54.746 region:rollup2

SECONDLY.

00:41:54.746 --> 00:41:57.281 region:rollup2

SEARCH OF A IS.

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:12.196 region:rollup2
GOING AFTER A NONEXISTENT

00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:13.598 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. THERE IS PROBLEMS IN

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:15.500 region:rollup2
COURT REPORTING AND WE SHOULD BE

00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:17.035 region:rollup2
CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND I CAN NAME

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.903 region:rollup2
TO WRITE OFF THE TOP.

00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:20.271 region:rollup2
FIRST COURT REPORTERS ARE NOT

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:22.306 region:rollup2
BEING PROVIDED IN CIVIL

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:24.142 region:rollup2
LITIGATION IN THE COURTS.

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:25.710 region:rollup2
FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE DOING

NEED THEM AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:30.848 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.183 region:rollup2
SECOND BUT THERE'S APPARENTLY A

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:33.985 region:rollup2
GROWING SHORTAGE OF COURT

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:35.920 region:rollup2

REPORTERS.

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:41.592 region:rollup2
SO WE COULD HAVE MORE. SO THERE

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:42.393 region:rollup2
ARE ISSUES WITH COURT REPORTING

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:43.394 region:rollup2

ADDRESS

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:48.366 region:rollup2

SO I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT.

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:05.376 region:rollup2
THIS LAW BECAUSE I'M ASTONISHED

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:06.477 region:rollup2
EMBARRASSED BUT THE FACT THAT WE

00:49:05.376 --> 00:49:08.212 region:rollup2
REMAIN THE ONLY STATE AND NATION

00:49:06.477 --> 00:49:08.746 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T THAT DOESN'T LICENSE

00:49:08.212 --> 00:49:09.814 region:rollup2
AND REGULATE OUR ATHLETIC

00:49:08.746 --> 00:49:11.549 region:rollup2
TRAINERS.

00:49:09.814 --> 00:49:13.884 region:rollup2
AND THIS LACK OF OVERSIGHT IS A

00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:16.220 region:rollup2
SERIOUS THREAT ARE NOT ONLY TO

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:17.588 region:rollup2
ATHLETES BUT THE PUBLIC AT LARGE

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.523 region:rollup2
A THIRD OF OUR ATHLETIC TRAINERS

00:49:17.588 --> 00:49:21.292 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED. THEY WORK

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:23.027 region:rollup2
WITH THE PUBLIC IN VARIOUS A

00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:24.762 region:rollup2
CAPACITY SUCH AS THE MILITARY

00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:25.930 region:rollup2
AND OFF AND WORKPLACE SETTINGS

00:49:24.762 --> 00:49:27.531 region:rollup2
AND ALSO AND CLINICS WITH

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.466 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS LIKE LIKE WITH ME AT

00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:30.034 region:rollup2
UCSF.

00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:31.502 region:rollup2
AND CURRENTLY ANYONE.

00:49:30.034 --> 00:49:33.337 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE

00:49:31.502 --> 00:49:34.371 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CERTIFICATION CAN ACT

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:36.841 region:rollup2
AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER PROVIDE

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:37.408 region:rollup2
CARE AND THIS COPYRIGHT OUT CAN

00:49:36.841 --> 00:49:38.442 region:rollup2
YOU CAN RESULT IN DANGEROUS

00:49:37.408 --> 00:49:39.777 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:41.345 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE FROM SURVEYS THAT

00:49:39.777 --> 00:49:42.613 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE IS ESTIMATED THAT

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:44.548 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS

00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:46.083 region:rollup2
OUR HIGH SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW. WHO

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:47.718 region:rollup2
ACT AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE NOT

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:48.953 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE CARE AND

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:50.754 region:rollup2
THEREFORE POTENTIALLY

00:49:48.953 --> 00:49:51.856 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAPPEN

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.122 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:49:51.856 --> 00:49:53.190 region:rollup2
EDUCATION?

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:54.191 region:rollup2
?

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:56.193 region:rollup2
AND HERE'S ANOTHER UNSETTLING

00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:57.328 region:rollup2
FACT THE LACK OF REGULATION

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:58.362 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT ATHLETIC CHANGE FROM

00:49:57.328 --> 00:49:59.864 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES CAN COME TO OUR

00:49:58.362 --> 00:50:01.565 region:rollup2
STATE THE PRACTICE.

00:49:59.864 --> 00:50:03.367 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:04.768 region:rollup2
ANYBODY TO SAY HEY.

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:06.403 region:rollup2
THEY PROVIDED AT THAT DANGEROUS

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:07.471 region:rollup2
SITUATION OTHER STATE HERE THEY

00:50:06.403 --> 00:50:09.106 region:rollup2
ARE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:10.975 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE TRUE

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:12.776 region:rollup2
FACTS.

00:50:10.975 --> 00:50:15.279 region:rollup2

00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:17.774 region:rollup2
MORE RESOURCES JUST TO HANDLE

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:19.543 region:rollup2

OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AMOK THE

00:56:21.445 --> 00:56:24.047 region:rollup2

WE THINK THAT.

00:56:31.622 --> 00:56:34.024 region:rollup2
JUST BY IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL

00:56:50.674 --> 00:56:53.677 region:rollup2
BROAD.

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:55.178 region:rollup2

IF YOU LOOK AT THE.

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:09.826 region:rollup2
THE BROAD DEFINITION OF OF

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:11.762 region:rollup2

THERE IS I'VE OF.

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:22.946 region:rollup2
QUITE A LONG HISTORY TO THIS

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:24.247 region:rollup2
EFFORT. ALL AYE NOT OUTRIGHT

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:25.982 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO SOME.

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:27.551 region:rollup2
INTERIM STEP TO GET US TO

LICENSING BUT.

01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:30.954 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IS GONNA BE THE

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.755 region:rollup2
SUBJECT OF SOME DISCUSSION THAT

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:33.590 region:rollup2
THE REALITY THOUGH IS THERE ARE

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:35.058 region:rollup2
SOME REALLY FUNDAMENTAL REASONS

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:36.359 region:rollup2
WHY TITLE PROTECTION IS SIMPLY

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:38.662 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:40.397 region:rollup2
NOT SUFFICIENT I DON'T WANT IT

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:41.865 region:rollup2
DIRECT THAT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:43.600 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATION.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:45.802 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKFORCE.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.171 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT'S BECOME

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:49.072 region:rollup2
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO ME IS OF

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.307 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE SITE.

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:52.609 region:rollup2
ATHLETIC TRAINERS WHO ARE

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:54.077 region:rollup2
OPERATING I SEE MOST NOT ALL BUT

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:57.047 region:rollup2
MOST IN CALIFORNIA.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:58.481 region:rollup2
ARE ARE A RELATIVELY HIGHLY

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.250 region:rollup2
EDUCATED. AND.

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:02.152 region:rollup2
THESE FOLKS WANT.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:04.020 region:rollup2
TO BE LICENSE

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:05.188 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THERE THERE'S TO UNDER

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.156 region:rollup2
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:08.191 region:rollup2
BEEN COLLECTED AND FEES IN

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:09.993 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATION OF. A SETTING UP A

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:11.194 region:rollup2
LICENSING STRUCTURE THIS IS

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:12.529 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:14.631 region:rollup2
WHAT

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:17.334 region:rollup2
TO ELEVATE THEIR PROFESSION.

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:19.002 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I WANTTO SEE IS

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:20.470 region:rollup2
A BARRIER I THINK IT'S FRANKLY

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:22.505 region:rollup2
ELEVATING OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:23.506 region:rollup2
ATHLETIC TRAINERS BUT ALSO

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.909 region:rollup2
CREATES THESE PROTECTIONS WHEN

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:26.943 region:rollup2
THEY. ARE ACROSS A STATE LINES

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:29.045 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS.

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:30.380 region:rollup2
DEFERRED MIKE PATCHES ARE WHO

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:31.982 region:rollup2
CAN TALK ABOUT.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:34.651 region:rollup2
WHY TITLE PROTECTION IS SIMPLY

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:36.586 region:rollup2

OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY BOARD BE

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:09.098 region:rollup2
THE ONE TO OVERSEE BUT WHAT I

HEARD IS BECAUSE.

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:12.001 region:rollup2
FEES MIGHT BE CHARGED MORE BUT

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:13.636 region:rollup2

DOCTORATE Y. DOES THAT MAKE THE

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.944 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL BOARD NOT THE RIGHT

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:22.412 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:23.313 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT'S I WAS JUST TRYING TO

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:24.881 region:rollup2
POINT OUT SOME OF THE

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:26.549 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:28.318 region:rollup2
ATHLETIC TRAINING AND.

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:29.719 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY THE THAT

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.119 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS THERE

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:32.021 region:rollup2
IS IN THE PRACTICE

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:34.958 region:rollup2
ITSELF

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:35.725 region:rollup2
AND. THE THE PATIENT OUTCOMES IN

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:37.293 region:rollup2
THE FIFTH AND THE FIFTH IN THE

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:38.728 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT IS REQUIRED.

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.295 region:rollup2
OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:40.930 region:rollup2
VERSES.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:42.632 region:rollup2
ACT VERSES ATHLETIC TRAINING

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:43.666 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT THEY ARE. THEY ARE

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:45.101 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:47.804 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:50.039 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:50.807 region:rollup2
THE BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:52.375 region:rollup2
THERAPY.

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:54.477 region:rollup2
NOT

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:56.045 region:rollup2
BEING AS FOCUSED AS THEY NEED TO

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:57.680 region:rollup2
BE AND THE CONCERNS OFF FROM A

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:59.082 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF THEIR

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.085 region:rollup2
BEING UPWARD PRESSURE.

ON ATHLETIC TRAINING AND SO IT'S

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.460 region:rollup2
IT'S A TWO FOLD CONCERN.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:12.462 region:rollup2

WHERE YOU WERE AN ATHLETIC

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:35.338 region:rollup2
TRAINER. AND YOU WERE CALLED

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:36.939 region:rollup2
UPON AND THE PERSON YOU WERE

01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:38.041 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.842 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED A

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:41.444 region:rollup2
PATIENT.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:45.615 region:rollup2
DOES IT BECOME A BIT SEMANTIC

01:09:43.079 --> 01:09:47.483 region:rollup2
GOAL OR. THAT I MEAN WE JUST GOT

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:49.552 region:rollup2

.

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:59.162 region:rollup2
MUSIC CANNOT BE A PATIENT WITHIN

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.762 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT OF AN ATHLETIC

01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:01.230 region:rollup2

SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:04.700 region:rollup2
LARGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:06.703 region:rollup2
TWO IS ATHLETES WHEN THEY'RE

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.437 region:rollup2

OUTCOMES FROM THOSE WHO ARE

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:09.218 region:rollup2
CERTIFIED NOT CERTIFIED WE'VE

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:10.453 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE TO STE.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:12.255 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CERTIFIED

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:13.990 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO EVEN BEGIN

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:14.590 region:rollup2
DOING THAT SO THERE REALLY ISN'T

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:17.560 region:rollup2
A WAY TO COMPARE THOSE APPLES

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:19.061 region:rollup2
AND ORANGES.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.097 region:rollup2
AND SILVA SMOG AGAIN ON THIS

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:22.398 region:rollup2
IDEA OF GOING TO A FULL

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:24.033 region:rollup2
LICENSURE. IT MEANS YOU'RE

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:25.501 region:rollup2
INTERVENING STEP WHEREYOU COULD

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:26.903 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:29.972 region:rollup2
GRANTED TO BE CERTIFIED.

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:31.307 region:rollup2
WHO'S PRACTICING THAT.

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:33.075 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY OPEN TO HAVING THAT

01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:34.744 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION I WANT US TO GET TO

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:36.779 region:rollup2
FULL LICENSURE I'D LOVE TO DO IT

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:38.180 region:rollup2
WITH THIS BILL. THIS YEAR

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:39.548 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY CAN MAKE A STATEMENT

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.783 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT AND AND FINALLY GET IT

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:41.083 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.752 region:rollup2
BUT LOOK I.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:44.086 region:rollup2
AND.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:45.755 region:rollup2
TALKING WITH ALL OF THE

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:47.056 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION ON THIS THING I THINK

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:48.090 region:rollup2
THEY'RE A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:49.458 region:rollup2
CAN MOST CERTAINLY TAKE CARE OF

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:51.494 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:53.696 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL SCOPE ISSUES WITH.

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:56.999 region:rollup2
OF FISCAL AS THERE PESTS.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:57.600 region:rollup2
IN THE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.367 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REALLY DIFFICULT TO

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.336 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH.

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:02.138 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING

01:14:00.336 --> 01:14:03.639 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL OF THOSE ISSUES.

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:04.106 region:rollup2
THIS WEEK

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:07.610 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:08.778 region:rollup2
I JUST THINK IF WE.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:11.213 region:rollup2
LEAVE THIS ISSUE YET ANOTHER

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:12.381 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:14.383 region:rollup2
AND DON'T MOVE FORWARD.

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:16.052 region:rollup2
A CHEST UP POINTS TO THE FACT

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:17.954 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:18.954 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S INCAPABLE OF

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:20.489 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AND I

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:23.826 region:rollup2
DON'T ACCEPT THAT.

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:24.794 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO FIX THIS CAN AND.

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:26.395 region:rollup2
AND THEN THESE ATHLETIC TRAINERS

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:28.230 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PASSED SUPERVISED BY

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:31.067 region:rollup2
WHOM THE LICENSED ATHLETIC

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:32.401 region:rollup2
TRAINERS ANY SUPERVISION.

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:34.870 region:rollup2
WHICH MIKE WOULD YOU SPEAK TO

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:36.906 region:rollup2

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:45.915 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:48.284 region:rollup2
MANDATE FOR THAT.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:50.052 region:rollup2
AND THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:52.121 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN ALL THESE MEDICAL

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:55.124 region:rollup2

THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL BUT I

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.102 region:rollup2
KNOW I. THE INDUSTRY GENERALLY

01:34:00.168 --> 01:34:01.369 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS I'M MOVING THIS BILL

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:02.871 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:03.671 region:rollup2
YOU ALL PASSED LEGISLATION LAST

01:34:02.871 --> 01:34:05.573 region:rollup2
YEAR THE CREATED THE A IN THE M.

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:06.674 region:rollup2
LICENSING PATHWAY. WHAT THE

01:34:05.573 --> 01:34:07.275 region:rollup2
BUREAU DID IN DECEMBER IN THE

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:07.942 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WAS TO

01:34:07.275 --> 01:34:09.277 region:rollup2
CREATE A FIRE WALL BETWEEN THOSE

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:10.812 region:rollup2
TWO PATHWAYS WHICH MAKES IT

01:34:09.277 --> 01:34:12.714 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE FOR?

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:13.515 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKING IN THE

01:34:12.714 --> 01:34:15.450 region:rollup2
MEDICAL FIELD TO.

01:34:13.515 --> 01:34:16.584 region:rollup2
TO ENGAGE CONDUCT.

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:18.486 region:rollup2
BUSINESS COMMERCIALLY WAS

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:20.622 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY IN THE ADULT FIELD AND

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:21.823 region:rollup2
VICE VERSA WHAT THIS MEANS NOW

01:34:20.622 --> 01:34:23.958 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHEN THE PLANT IS THIS

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:25.693 region:rollup2
BIG AT THE CULTIVATOR IT MUST BE

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:27.729 region:rollup2
DESIGNATED AS AN ADULT USE OR

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:29.163 region:rollup2
MET MEDICAL USE PLANT. AND NEVER

01:34:27.729 --> 01:34:30.965 region:rollup2
SHALL IT CHANGED FROM THAT POINT

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:33.301 region:rollup2
UNTIL IT IS SOLD TO A CONSUMER

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:35.270 region:rollup2
EITHER AS A PLANT OR AS AAS A.

01:34:33.301 --> 01:34:37.539 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE PRODUCT AT THE END

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:38.072 region:rollup2
OF THE LINE AND THAT MAKES IT

01:34:37.539 --> 01:34:39.707 region:rollup2
OPERATIONALLY INCREDIBLY

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:41.543 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE. FOR OUR BUSINESSES TO

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:42.744 region:rollup2
OPERATE ON BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

01:34:41.543 --> 01:34:44.245 region:rollup2
WHAT THE MARKET IS GOING TO LOOK

01:34:42.744 --> 01:34:46.247 region:rollup2
LIKE DOWN THE PATH. I'M WE NEED

01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:47.916 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO BE NIMBLE ENOUGH

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:49.117 region:rollup2
TO MOVE THE PRODUCT FROM ONE

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:50.451 region:rollup2
SIDE TO THE OTHER WE DO OTHER

01:34:49.117 --> 01:34:51.953 region:rollup2
TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM DOESN'T

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:53.521 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT WE WILL KNOW EXACTLY

01:34:51.953 --> 01:34:55.390 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT PRODUCT CAME FROM AND

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:56.391 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S GOING. AT EVERY POINT

01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:58.193 region:rollup2
BUT UNDER THIS BILL.

01:34:56.391 --> 01:35:02.897 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE

01:34:58.193 --> 01:35:03.464 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE FIREWALL ON BETWEEN A

01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:05.033 region:rollup2
MAN AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:05.900 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:06.467 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AMY JENKINS

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.435 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:08.970 region:rollup2
CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND STRONG

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:10.605 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:12.006 region:rollup2
OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITIES THIS

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:14.075 region:rollup2
YEAR TO ADDRESS ME WHEN I THINK

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:16.778 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR. IN ADDITION TO WHAT.

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:18.646 region:rollup2
MISTER ROUNDS MARTIN HAD TO SAY.

01:35:16.778 --> 01:35:18.947 region:rollup2
WE WHICH IS ECHO THE FACT THAT

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:21.249 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD.

01:35:18.947 --> 01:35:23.318 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON

01:35:21.249 --> 01:35:25.019 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AND THAT IS REQUIRED

01:35:23.318 --> 01:35:27.288 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS PARTICULAR MODEL AYE

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:29.224 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT TWO SEPARATE PATHS.

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:31.693 region:rollup2
ONE FOR MEDICINAL ONE FOR ADULT

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:33.561 region:rollup2
USE AND THAT'S EXTREMELY KATA

01:35:31.693 --> 01:35:34.629 region:rollup2
COSTLY AND ADDS DUPLICATING OUR

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.798 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS.

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:38.333 region:rollup2
IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE

01:35:36.798 --> 01:35:40.602 region:rollup2
GIVEN WE DO HAVE LIMITATIONS IN

01:35:38.333 --> 01:35:42.437 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO

01:35:40.602 --> 01:35:45.039 region:rollup2
DO AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES I WOULD

01:35:42.437 --> 01:35:45.873 region:rollup2
ALSO NOTE TOO THAT.

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:47.342 region:rollup2
THIS ENSURES ACCESS

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:48.543 region:rollup2
BY ALLOWING THE CROSSOVER

01:35:47.342 --> 01:35:50.511 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A AND M. IN

01:35:48.543 --> 01:35:52.180 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THAT ALLOW WE CAN

01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:53.848 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL HAVE

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:55.550 region:rollup2
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS OBVIOUSLY THE

NON CERTIFIED MASSAGE PROVIDERS

02:23:15.787 --> 02:23:20.425 region:rollup2

LOWER PRICES ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:30:45.937 --> 02:30:48.907 region:rollup2

IMMEDIATELY CORRECT.

02:31:05.089 --> 02:31:09.460 region:rollup2
FIRST.

02:31:07.759 --> 02:31:11.930 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW IN CALIFORNIA

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:13.498 region:rollup2
ALLOWS ABOARD AND OR AGENCY.

02:31:11.930 --> 02:31:14.766 region:rollup2
TO PROHIBIT INDIVIDUALS FROM

THIS POLICY NOT ONLY DENY

SOMEONE THE RIGHT TO EARN A

02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:25.176 region:rollup2
LIVING BUT IS OBVIOUSLY

02:31:23.708 --> 02:31:27.178 region:rollup2
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

02:31:25.176 --> 02:31:27.812 region:rollup2
LIMITING THE PERSON'S ABILITY TO

02:31:27.178 --> 02:31:29.948 region:rollup2
EARN INCOME AND CATCH UP ON THE

02:31:27.812 --> 02:31:32.016 region:rollup2
ISLANDS.

02:31:29.948 --> 02:31:33.751 region:rollup2
SEC.

02:31:32.016 --> 02:31:35.653 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS A BOARD

02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:36.721 region:rollup2
AND OR AGENCY TO BAR LICENSURE

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:39.090 region:rollup2
FOR SOMEONE WHO IS FALLING

02:31:36.721 --> 02:31:40.959 region:rollup2
BEHIND ON THEIR TAX PAYMENTS.

02:31:39.090 --> 02:31:41.793 region:rollup2
ONCE AGAIN THIS IS A BLOW NOT

02:31:40.959 --> 02:31:43.227 region:rollup2
JUST TO THE RIGHT TO EARN A

02:31:41.793 --> 02:31:44.929 region:rollup2
LIVING BUT ALSO LIKELY. TO THE

02:31:43.227 --> 02:31:46.798 region:rollup2
STATE TREASURY.

02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:48.666 region:rollup2
THIRD.

02:31:46.798 --> 02:31:49.801 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ONEROUS LICENSING

02:31:48.666 --> 02:31:51.102 region:rollup2
LAWS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR

02:31:49.801 --> 02:31:53.404 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD.

02:31:51.102 --> 02:31:55.073 region:rollup2
TO FIND JOBS.

02:31:53.404 --> 02:31:56.808 region:rollup2
FORMER OFFENDERS ARE FREQUENTLY

02:31:55.073 --> 02:31:58.376 region:rollup2
DENIED PROFESSIONAL LICENSES AND

02:31:56.808 --> 02:32:00.244 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY HAVE NO ADVANCE

02:31:58.376 --> 02:32:01.612 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE ON WHETHER A CONVICTION

02:32:00.244 --> 02:32:02.747 region:rollup2
WOULD DISQUALIFY THEM FROM AN

02:32:01.612 --> 02:32:04.515 region:rollup2
OCCUPATION SO THEY JUMP THROUGH

02:32:02.747 --> 02:32:06.117 region:rollup2
ALL THE HOOPS ALL THE FEES

02:32:04.515 --> 02:32:08.052 region:rollup2
COURSES AND TRAINING. ONLY TO BE

02:32:06.117 --> 02:32:09.921 region:rollup2
DENIED.

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:11.122 region:rollup2
AB TWO FOUR NINE WOULD ALLOW A

02:32:09.921 --> 02:32:13.358 region:rollup2
FORMER OFFENDER TO PETITION THE

02:32:11.122 --> 02:32:14.392 region:rollup2
BORDER AGENCY TO NOTIFY THEM

02:32:13.358 --> 02:32:16.928 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY WILL QUALIFY FOR A

02:32:14.392 --> 02:32:18.229 region:rollup2
LICENSE.

02:32:16.928 --> 02:32:19.530 region:rollup2
AND THE SAD TRUTH COLLEAGUES IS

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:21.499 region:rollup2
THAT THESE REGULATIONS OFTEN

02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:23.201 region:rollup2
FALL HARDEST ON THE LEAST

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:24.769 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGED IN OUR SOCIETY.

02:32:23.201 --> 02:32:26.471 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WERE JUST TRYING TO EARN

02:32:24.769 --> 02:32:28.439 region:rollup2

THIS BILL THE OCCUPATIONAL

02:32:37.482 --> 02:32:41.285 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM BY ELIMINATING

THE RIGHT TO EARN A LIVING ARE

02:32:44.155 --> 02:32:47.425 region:rollup2
NO GREATER THAN NECESSARY. FOR

02:32:45.156 --> 02:32:49.861 region:rollup2

TWO OF THOSE BEARS HAVE

02:33:30.068 --> 02:33:34.138 region:rollup2
GENERATED A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:35.807 region:rollup2

OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING REFORM.

02:33:35.807 --> 02:33:38.376 region:rollup2
THE ROOM AT THE ROOT OF THE

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:40.078 region:rollup2
PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT

02:33:38.376 --> 02:33:41.779 region:rollup2

TRAINING NEEDED TO GET A LICENSE

02:34:02.467 --> 02:34:05.703 region:rollup2

02:34:04.268 --> 02:34:07.105 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE DO

I I GUESS TO TO SUMMARIZE THE

02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:30.755 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE POINTS RAISED BY

THE.

02:35:30.755 --> 02:35:33.591 region:rollup2
AUTHOR AND PROPONENTS REALLY DO

SOUND SINCE WHAT I THINK THEY'RE

02:35:33.591 --> 02:35:37.595 region:rollup2
IT THERE'S PROBABLY SOME COMMON

02:35:34.959 --> 02:35:39.230 region:rollup2

LOANS THINGS LIKE THAT BUT. THE

02:35:42.333 --> 02:35:45.503 region:rollup2
FACT IS THAT THIS BILL KIND OF

02:35:44.068 --> 02:35:47.271 region:rollup2
BLOWS OPEN THE PROCESS AND

02:35:45.503 --> 02:35:48.806 region:rollup2
REALLY JEOPARDIZES EVEN THE

02:35:47.271 --> 02:35:49.774 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE OF WHAT A CRITICALLY

02:35:48.806 --> 02:35:51.275 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WORKER PROTECTION

AREAS THAT ON WE SHOULD BE

02:35:54.612 --> 02:35:57.715 region:rollup2
REALLY CAREFUL WITH SO FOR

02:35:55.913 --> 02:36:00.051 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO

02:35:57.715 --> 02:36:01.552 region:rollup2
IS ALLOW. SAY SOMEONE WITHOUT

02:36:00.051 --> 02:36:03.221 region:rollup2
ANY EXPOSURE TO AN INDUSTRY TO

TOM TO GO THROUGH THE APPEAL

02:36:04.922 --> 02:36:07.592 region:rollup2
PROCESS ALSO GET THAT I'D. AND

02:36:06.290 --> 02:36:08.826 region:rollup2
THEN THEY CAN SUE IN COURT

02:36:07.592 --> 02:36:10.394 region:rollup2
AGREED TO PRIVATE RIGHT OF

02:36:08.826 --> 02:36:11.896 region:rollup2
ACTION WHERE THEY CAN SUE.

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:13.130 region:rollup2
TO ESSENTIALLY OVERTURN ANY

02:36:11.896 --> 02:36:14.398 region:rollup2
REGULATION AND MY UNDERSTANDING

02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:16.734 region:rollup2
IS THE NEW VERSION OF THE BILL

02:36:14.398 --> 02:36:19.036 region:rollup2
LIMITS IT TOO REGULATIONS WITHIN

02:36:16.734 --> 02:36:19.937 region:rollup2
THE JURISDICTION OF THE BOARD.

02:36:19.036 --> 02:36:20.738 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:36:19.937 --> 02:36:22.173 region:rollup2
TERRIBLY CLEAR WHAT THAT MEANS

02:36:20.738 --> 02:36:23.641 region:rollup2
BUT FOR EXAMPLE TO TAKE ON THE

02:36:22.173 --> 02:36:25.643 region:rollup2
TREE TRIMMING THAT WAS RAISED BY

02:36:23.641 --> 02:36:26.677 region:rollup2
THE ARM PROPONENTS. IT THE FOR

02:36:25.643 --> 02:36:27.979 region:rollup2
ONE THIS IS A VERY VERY

02:36:26.677 --> 02:36:30.248 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS OCCUPATION FACT WAS SO

02:36:27.979 --> 02:36:31.716 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS THAT KOLCHAK TO ENACT

02:36:30.248 --> 02:36:33.317 region:rollup2
A SPECIAL EMPHASIS PROGRAM A FEW

02:36:31.716 --> 02:36:34.452 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO BECAUSE THERE WERE.

02:36:33.317 --> 02:36:35.953 region:rollup2
TWELVE METALLIC HE'S IN A TWO

02:36:34.452 --> 02:36:37.688 region:rollup2
YEAR PERIOD OF SIX OF THOSE

02:36:35.953 --> 02:36:39.323 region:rollup2
OCCURRED IN A FOUR. FOUR OF THEM

02:36:37.688 --> 02:36:41.292 region:rollup2
OCCURRED IN A SIX WEEK PERIOD.

02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:43.361 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE ARE VERY GOOD

02:36:41.292 --> 02:36:44.362 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR WHY WE HAVE A. YOU

02:36:43.361 --> 02:36:45.730 region:rollup2
KNOW LONG BODY YOUR TREE

02:36:44.362 --> 02:36:47.031 region:rollup2
TRIMMING SAFETY REGULATIONS AND

02:36:45.730 --> 02:36:48.733 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS

02:36:47.031 --> 02:36:50.668 region:rollup2
ALLOW SOMEONE TO SUE AND THEN

02:36:48.733 --> 02:36:51.836 region:rollup2
SAY. I THINK WE NEED TO OVERTURN

02:36:50.668 --> 02:36:53.271 region:rollup2
ALL THE STREET TRIMMING SAFETY

02:36:51.836 --> 02:36:54.939 region:rollup2

CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD.

02:36:54.939 --> 02:36:57.308 region:rollup2
WHO LIKELY HAD LITTLE IF

02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:58.643 region:rollup2
ANYTHING TO DO WITH AN ACTING

02:36:57.308 --> 02:37:00.945 region:rollup2
THOSE REGULATIONS WOULD THEN BE

02:36:58.643 --> 02:37:02.079 region:rollup2
FORCED TO GO TO COURT? AND PROVE

02:37:00.945 --> 02:37:04.215 region:rollup2
BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE

02:37:02.079 --> 02:37:05.616 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF THOSE TREE TRIMMING

FIRST SECTION OF THIS BILL AND

02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:12.123 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY TO FAIL TO DO THAT

02:37:10.254 --> 02:37:14.091 region:rollup2
THE COURT IS EQUIRED TO ENJOY

02:37:12.123 --> 02:37:16.060 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE REGULATIONS AND SO. IT

02:37:14.091 --> 02:37:17.361 region:rollup2
CREATES THIS PROCESS WHERE AN

02:37:16.060 --> 02:37:19.063 region:rollup2
AGENCY THAT WASN'T RESPONSIBLE

02:37:17.361 --> 02:37:20.498 region:rollup2
FOR THE REGULATION COULD BE

02:37:19.063 --> 02:37:21.866 region:rollup2
FORCED TO DEFEND IT IN COURT.

02:37:20.498 --> 02:37:23.234 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY FAIL TO MEET THE

02:37:21.866 --> 02:37:24.602 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH BAR PREPONDERANCE OF

02:37:23.234 --> 02:37:25.803 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THEN THE ENTIRE

02:37:24.602 --> 02:37:27.204 region:rollup2
REGULATION GETS AND JOIN THE

02:37:25.803 --> 02:37:28.839 region:rollup2

02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:38.983 region:rollup2
WERE THE LICENSING BOARDS TO

AND I WHO WERE NOT.

02:37:58.269 --> 02:38:02.106 region:rollup2
A UNIONIZED INDUSTRY.

02:38:00.738 --> 02:38:04.075 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:38:02.106 --> 02:38:07.311 region:rollup2
MITCH MENTION THIS WE SEE THIS

02:38:04.075 --> 02:38:07.845 region:rollup2
IS DEREGULATION VIA LITIGATION.

02:38:07.311 --> 02:38:09.947 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A

02:38:07.845 --> 02:38:11.682 region:rollup2
PATCHWORK OF CONFLICTING

02:38:09.947 --> 02:38:12.883 region:rollup2
SUPERIOR COURT DECISIONS THAT

02:38:11.682 --> 02:38:14.785 region:rollup2
OUR STATE BOARD OF FARMING

02:38:12.883 --> 02:38:15.353 region:rollup2
BECAUSE INDOLOGY WHEN OUR

02:38:15.353 --> 02:38:18.689 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH.

02:38:16.721 --> 02:38:20.491 region:rollup2
FOR THE MORE THAT THERE'S

02:38:18.689 --> 02:38:22.226 region:rollup2
RECENT RESEARCH THAT INDICATES

02:38:20.491 --> 02:38:23.861 region:rollup2
LICENSURE PROVIDES A ROAD

02:38:22.226 --> 02:38:25.930 region:rollup2
LESSONS.

02:38:23.861 --> 02:38:27.798 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT GAPS AMONG MINORITIES

02:38:25.930 --> 02:38:29.333 region:rollup2
AND WOMEN.

02:38:27.798 --> 02:38:31.235 region:rollup2
BECAUSE LICENSORS PROVIDE

02:38:29.333 --> 02:38:32.303 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO EMPLOYERS ABOUT

02:38:31.235 --> 02:38:33.938 region:rollup2
THE BACKGROUND OF THOSE

02:38:32.303 --> 02:38:36.707 region:rollup2
LICENSEES

02:38:33.938 --> 02:38:38.843 region:rollup2
SO LICENSURE DOES HAVE A VALUE.

02:38:36.707 --> 02:38:41.379 region:rollup2
IN OUR CONNIE. AND JUSTIN

02:38:38.843 --> 02:38:43.180 region:rollup2
INTERESTING HISTORICAL SIDE NOTE

02:38:41.379 --> 02:38:45.116 region:rollup2
MENTIONING UNIONS EARLIER. AS

WHEN WHEN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF

02:45:39.563 --> 02:45:42.099 region:rollup2
THE FEW STATES THAT HIS

OF?

02:46:12.062 --> 02:46:17.234 region:rollup2
HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE

02:46:14.898 --> 02:46:19.470 region:rollup2
BEEN DENIED THEIR LICENSES DUE

02:46:17.234 --> 02:46:20.838 region:rollup2

I ABOUT MY ONCE AND FOR THAT

02:46:27.277 --> 02:46:29.012 region:rollup2
QUESTION. CERTAIN.

02:46:28.045 --> 02:46:29.279 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE

02:46:29.012 --> 02:46:30.848 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:32.683 region:rollup2
.

02:46:30.848 --> 02:46:35.385 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IT SEEMS THAT THAT THE

02:46:32.683 --> 02:46:36.753 region:rollup2
TAXES THE ABILITY FOR BOARDS TO

02:46:35.385 --> 02:46:39.356 region:rollup2
DENY PEOPLE LICENSE BASED ON

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:40.691 region:rollup2
UNPAID TAXES RIGHT NOW AT LA

02:46:39.356 --> 02:46:42.192 region:rollup2
ONLY PERMITS LICENSE AT PORTS TO

02:46:40.691 --> 02:46:43.861 region:rollup2
DO THAT FOR THE MOST EGREGIOUS

02:46:42.192 --> 02:46:44.928 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS BUT IT IS. THEY ARE

02:46:43.861 --> 02:46:47.064 region:rollup2
STILL ABLE THE BOARDS ARE STILL

02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:47.998 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ENACT REGULATIONS OF

02:46:47.064 --> 02:46:49.700 region:rollup2
THAT SORT IN THE FUTURE SO THIS

02:46:47.998 --> 02:46:51.268 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A PROPHYLACTIC MEASURE.

02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:52.402 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO OR

02:46:51.268 --> 02:46:53.971 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGE THEM FROM DOING THAT

02:46:52.402 --> 02:46:55.372 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE AND PROMOTE WE

02:46:53.971 --> 02:46:56.807 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN I WHEN I REPRESENT

02:46:55.372 --> 02:46:57.641 region:rollup2

02:46:56.807 --> 02:46:59.176 region:rollup2
TIMES.

02:46:57.641 --> 02:47:00.944 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T EVEN APPLY FOR A

02:46:59.176 --> 02:47:01.845 region:rollup2
LICENSE BECAUSE THEY JUST ASSUME

02:47:00.944 --> 02:47:03.347 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BEAT

02:47:01.845 --> 02:47:04.681 region:rollup2
DENIED SO EVEN IF WE HAVE A LACK

02:47:03.347 --> 02:47:05.916 region:rollup2
OF INFORMATION REGARDING HOW

02:47:04.681 --> 02:47:07.451 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEEN DENIED

02:47:05.916 --> 02:47:08.685 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DON'T SEE IS HOW MANY

02:47:07.451 --> 02:47:10.487 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EXCEPT FOR TO

02:47:08.685 --> 02:47:12.122 region:rollup2
EVEN APPLY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT.

02:47:10.487 --> 02:47:13.457 region:rollup2
THEY WERE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:47:12.122 --> 02:47:14.925 region:rollup2
MEET THE CRITERIA.

02:47:13.457 --> 02:47:16.827 region:rollup2

.

02:48:07.210 --> 02:48:09.646 region:rollup2
I IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEAL

02:48:08.178 --> 02:48:10.614 region:rollup2
WITH THREE THINGS NUMBER ONE

02:48:09.646 --> 02:48:12.382 region:rollup2

ITEM THAT'S GONNA MAKE SENSE THE

02:48:19.323 --> 02:48:21.892 region:rollup2
NUMBER THREE THAT WE REALLY

02:48:20.490 --> 02:48:23.260 region:rollup2
RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF FORMER

02:48:21.892 --> 02:48:24.962 region:rollup2

02:48:23.260 --> 02:48:25.595 region:rollup2
LICENSE TO PURSUE A CAREER. I

02:48:24.962 --> 02:48:27.965 region:rollup2
