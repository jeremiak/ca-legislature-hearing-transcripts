CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS

02:26:08.359 --> 02:26:10.428
LEGISLATION FORWARD I THINK-

02:26:10.495 --> 02:26:13.331
THE REALITY IS THAT IT IS

02:26:13.397 --> 02:26:15.299
COMMONLY OKAY IT'S A COMMON

02:26:15.366 --> 02:26:19.303

SPECIFIC PURPOSE. OF- THE ROLE

02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:28.379
OF WAITING IT WAITING OUT

02:26:28.446 --> 02:26:31.949
SOMEONE THAT IS TERMINAL- AND-

02:26:32.016 --> 02:26:35.019
IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A

02:26:35.086 --> 02:26:37.155
MORAL ASPECT OF WHAT WE SEE

02:26:37.221 --> 02:26:39.290
SOMETIMES MAY NOT BE ILLEGAL

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:41.826
BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT-

02:26:41.893 --> 02:26:42.560
THEY REALLY CALLS INTO

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:45.696
QUESTION- OUR SYSTEM WELL IN

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:47.265
THAT KIND OF PRACTICES CONTINUE

02:26:47.331 --> 02:26:49.700
TO ALLOW TO HAPPEN WITHOUT-

02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:52.270
TRUE COMPENSATION- FOR THE PAIN

02:26:52.336 --> 02:26:54.038

KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION MAY

02:27:02.647 --> 02:27:04.415
FACE BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES

02:27:04.482 --> 02:27:05.183
TO CREATING A SYSTEM THAT

02:27:05.249 --> 02:27:07.585
ACTUALLY THE LEAST ATTEMPTS TO

02:27:07.652 --> 02:27:10.154
FIND JUSTICE. FOR THOSE THAT

02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:12.123
ARE THAT ARE OF VICTIMS I THINK

02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:13.858
IT DOES GO A LONG WAY IN THAT

02:27:13.925 --> 02:27:15.826
REGARD AND FOR THOSE THAT HAVE

02:27:15.893 --> 02:27:17.128
SUCH GREAT CONCERN ABOUT

INCREASED INSURANCE RATES. I

02:27:21.899 --> 02:27:22.433

GLAD THAT YOU DID BRING AND I

02:27:34.912 --> 02:27:36.747
THINK ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS

02:27:36.814 --> 02:27:38.349
AS A PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY. WAS

02:27:38.416 --> 02:27:40.585
HAVING PLAINTIFF DIED AND THEN

02:27:40.651 --> 02:27:42.019
TELLING THE FAMILY THAT.

02:27:42.086 --> 02:27:44.789
BASICALLY THE CLAIM FOR THE

FAMILY MEMBERS WITH THEIR LOVED

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.796
ONES. I THINK THE FACT THAT YOU

02:27:51.862 --> 02:27:55.199
PUT A- A SUNSET ON IT I THINK

02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:57.134
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD COMPROMISE

02:27:57.201 --> 02:28:00.071
TO- TRY THIS OUT FOR A WHILE

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:03.741
HI. THE FACT THAT WE ARE ONLY

02:28:03.808 --> 02:28:06.143
ONE OF FIVE STATES. THAT DO NOT

02:28:06.210 --> 02:28:09.247
ALLOW THAT IS A GREAT CONCERN

02:28:09.313 --> 02:28:11.048
SOMETHING THAT. FOR MANY YEARS

WORKING WITH OPPOSITION TO TRY

02:28:17.888 --> 02:28:20.458
TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE THIS IS.

02:28:20.524 --> 02:28:22.426
GOOD LEGISLATION POSSIBLE

02:28:22.493 --> 02:28:23.961
NOBODY'S GOING TO BE COMPLETELY

02:28:24.028 --> 02:28:26.831

02:28:30.368 --> 02:28:32.737
FORWARD WITH THAT. I THINK IS.

02:28:32.803 --> 02:28:34.605
A WONDERFUL THING FOR MANY OF

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:37.074

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:38.643

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:44.048

YOU'RE SEEN IN THE SYSTEM- I

02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:12.143
THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT

02:29:12.209 --> 02:29:13.411
THERE'S A REASON WHY WE'VE

02:29:13.477 --> 02:29:15.546
ALWAYS HAD THIS LEGAL.

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:17.848
DISTINCTION WHERE. YOU KNOW IF

02:29:17.915 --> 02:29:19.617
A PERSON PASSES AWAY THE PROPER

02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:21.319
CLAIM IS. A WRONGFUL DEATH

02:29:21.385 --> 02:29:24.255
CLAIM. THE PAIN AND SUFFERING

02:29:24.322 --> 02:29:25.890
BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW FOR THE

02:29:25.956 --> 02:29:28.292
VICTIM IT IS IT IS STILL LIVING

02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:29.894
IT'S NOT THAT THERE AREN'T

02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:30.928
REMEDIES BECAUSE THERE ACTUALLY

02:29:30.995 --> 02:29:33.531
ARE- IN WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS

02:29:33.597 --> 02:29:34.999
THERE'S INCLUDING PUNITIVE

02:29:35.066 --> 02:29:37.501
DAMAGES- AND MANY OTHER

02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:40.304
DIFFERENT REMEDIES THAT. DO

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:42.773
RESULT IN COMPENSATION. FOR THE

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:45.142
AGREED FAMILY THAT'S LOST- THE

02:29:45.209 --> 02:29:47.278
FAMILY MEMBER- IN TERMS OF

02:29:47.345 --> 02:29:49.080
ABUSES IN ANOTHER UNETHICAL

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:50.715
PRACTICES WE SEE THEM ON ALL

02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:54.251
SIDES OF. THE LITIGATION SYSTEM

02:29:54.318 --> 02:29:55.953
AND WE ALSO HAVE TOOLS ALREADY

02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:58.089
IN OUR- LEGAL SYSTEM TO DEAL

02:29:58.155 --> 02:30:02.660
WITH EITHER FRIVOLOUS MOTIONS

02:30:02.727 --> 02:30:06.964
OR DELAY TACTICS- WE HAVE THOSE

02:30:07.031 --> 02:30:08.532
IN OUR CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE TO

02:30:08.599 --> 02:30:09.967
PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE DOING

02:30:10.034 --> 02:30:12.069
UNETHICAL THINGS TO KEEP

02:30:12.136 --> 02:30:14.572
PEOPLE. FROM DELAYED FROM

02:30:14.638 --> 02:30:20.344
DELAYING JUSTICE- SO. YOU KNOW

02:30:20.411 --> 02:30:22.747
I CAN'T SEE A REAL STRONG

02:30:22.813 --> 02:30:25.049
REASON FOR CHANGING THAT LEGAL

02:30:25.116 --> 02:30:25.883
DISTINCTION WHICH AGAIN STILL

02:30:25.950 --> 02:30:28.285
GIVES EITHER THE AGGRIEVED

02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:30.454
PARTY THE VICTIM WHO- IS

02:30:30.521 --> 02:30:31.822
CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH PAIN

02:30:31.889 --> 02:30:33.457
AND SUFFERING THE CHANCE TO

02:30:33.524 --> 02:30:36.193
PROVE THEIR DAMAGES- IN COURT

02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:37.795
OR IF YOU HAVE A PLAN OF WHO

02:30:37.862 --> 02:30:39.597
HAS PASSED AWAY FOR THE FAMILY

02:30:39.663 --> 02:30:41.899
STILL TO PROCEED WITH. A

02:30:41.966 --> 02:30:44.735
WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION AND GET-

02:30:44.802 --> 02:30:50.007
COVERAGE- THE COUPLE QUESTIONS

02:30:50.074 --> 02:30:53.244
I JUST HAVE FOR YOU IS- THIS TO

02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:54.445
ME THIS WHERE TO GO FOR HOW

02:30:54.512 --> 02:30:58.382
DOES ONE PROVE DAMAGES- OF PAIN

02:30:58.449 --> 02:31:00.684
AND SUFFERING IF THE IF THE

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:04.088
PERSON HAS NOW PASSED AWAY- WHO

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:05.623
HOW IS EVIDENCE GOING TO BE

02:31:05.689 --> 02:31:07.591
INTRODUCED. TO PROVE THAT PAIN

02:31:07.658 --> 02:31:09.260
AND SUFFERING AND THEN WHAT

02:31:09.326 --> 02:31:14.398
WOULD BE THE- YEAH THE ABILITY

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:15.800
TO CHECK THE ACCURACY OR TO

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:19.703
CROSS EXAMINE- THAT EVIDENCE N

02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:21.939
THE COURT OF LAW AS A PRACTICAL

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:23.774
MATTER WHAT ROW AS A PRACTICAL

02:31:23.841 --> 02:31:26.110
MATTER YOU'VE GOT TO A HEART OF

02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:29.380
THE CONUNDRUM. WHICH IS THAT.

02:31:29.447 --> 02:31:32.383
ARE THERE IS A DELAY IN HEARING

02:31:32.450 --> 02:31:33.851
THE PEOPLE THAT COULD PREVENT

02:31:33.918 --> 02:31:35.686
THE EVIDENCE ARE NOT ABLE

02:31:35.753 --> 02:31:37.421
PRESENTED ARE NOT ABLE TO DO

02:31:37.488 --> 02:31:39.990
IT. AND THEN IT MOVES IT INTO A

02:31:40.057 --> 02:31:41.425
DIFFERENT CATEGORY BECAUSE

02:31:41.492 --> 02:31:44.361
THERE WAS THAT DELAY. AND THE

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:47.231
REAL GOAL IS TO NOT HAVE THAT

02:31:47.298 --> 02:31:49.066
SO THAT IN FACT YOU CAN HAVE

02:31:49.133 --> 02:31:51.669
THE EVIDENCE AS BEST YOU CAN IN

02:31:51.735 --> 02:31:54.338
PERSON WITHOUT HAVING TO SHIFT.

02:31:54.405 --> 02:31:56.607
TO THE NEXT STEP OBVIOUSLY YOU

02:31:56.674 --> 02:31:58.075
WOULD USE WHATEVER MEANS YOU

02:31:58.142 --> 02:32:00.911
HAVE TO INTRODUCE THE EVIDENCE

02:32:00.978 --> 02:32:04.315
AND GET TO THE FACTS. TO READ

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:05.583
THEM TO YOU CAN RUN INTO ISSUES

02:32:05.649 --> 02:32:08.652
LIKE HERE SAVE FOR INSTANCE-

02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:12.223
AND. YEAH I GUESS IF YOU'RE

02:32:12.289 --> 02:32:14.558
HAVING MAYBE A DOCTOR. TESTIFY

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:16.293
AS TO WHAT THEY YOU KNOW HAD

02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:17.461
SEEN YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE

02:32:17.528 --> 02:32:20.130
ABILITY TO. AND AGAIN LIKE

02:32:20.197 --> 02:32:21.398
THERE ISN'T A REMEDY TAKEN AWAY

02:32:21.465 --> 02:32:23.467
BECAUSE AGAIN NOW THE CASE IF

02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:24.635
SOMEONE PASSES AWAY AND THAT IT

02:32:24.702 --> 02:32:26.170
FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH

02:32:26.237 --> 02:32:29.306
DOES HAPPEN. TRADITIONALLY THAT

02:32:29.373 --> 02:32:32.209
BECOMES A WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM.

02:32:32.276 --> 02:32:33.277
AND NOW THE FAMILY IS BRINGING

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:35.312
THE CLAIM AND THERE AND

02:32:35.379 --> 02:32:36.480
INCLUDED IN THAT IS ALL OF THE

02:32:36.547 --> 02:32:38.549
THINGS THAT THEY HAVE LOST AS A

02:32:38.616 --> 02:32:41.118
RESULT- BUT THE PAIN AND

02:32:41.185 --> 02:32:42.753
SUFFERING IS REAL AND IT IS

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:46.223
DISTINCT AND WHAT HAPPENED IS.

02:32:46.290 --> 02:32:48.259
I MEAN IN NINETEEN WHATEVER THE

02:32:48.325 --> 02:32:53.831
YEAR WAS- SIXTY ONE THE

02:32:53.898 --> 02:32:56.634
LEGISLATURE SET THIS UP AND

02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:58.869
THEN THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW

02:32:58.936 --> 02:32:59.837
A COMMISSION ACTUALLY

02:32:59.904 --> 02:33:01.605
RECOMMENDED THREE DIFFERENT

02:33:01.672 --> 02:33:03.440
THINGS INCLUDING THIS IN THE

02:33:03.507 --> 02:33:06.076
LEGISLATURE CHOSE. TO LEAVE

02:33:06.143 --> 02:33:08.612
THIS OUT AND IT'S THE REASON

02:33:08.679 --> 02:33:10.614
THAT WERE ONE OF JUST FIVE

02:33:10.681 --> 02:33:14.552
STATES- THAT DOES IT THIS WAY

02:33:14.618 --> 02:33:17.688
IT IN THE FOR THE ANALYSIS

02:33:17.755 --> 02:33:19.823
RAISES A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION.

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:23.027
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT- THIS IS

02:33:23.093 --> 02:33:25.563
ABOUT ON UNDERLYING IN JUST A

02:33:25.629 --> 02:33:27.064
CERTAIN UNDERLYING THING THAT

02:33:27.131 --> 02:33:29.433
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR ABOUT

02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:31.602
COVERED AND IT IS ACTUALLY

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:33.537
ABOUT BOTH BECAUSE THE

02:33:33.604 --> 02:33:35.506
UNDERLYING JUSTICE NEEDS TO BE

02:33:35.573 --> 02:33:37.274
ADDRESSED IN IS SOMETHING THAT

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:38.342
WOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THIS

02:33:38.409 --> 02:33:41.545
BILL. IT WAS MAGNIFIED BY COVE

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:43.948
IT IT WAS IN EVIDENCE BY THE

02:33:44.014 --> 02:33:47.384
FACT THAT THE COURT SHUT DOWN.

02:33:47.451 --> 02:33:49.086
THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT APPLY

02:33:49.153 --> 02:33:50.387
EVEN IN A TIMELY WAY FOR

02:33:50.454 --> 02:33:52.523
PREFERENCES THE PREFERENCES

02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:54.625
WERE LIMITED IN CERTAIN WAYS

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:56.694
WHETHER IT WAS AGE SEVENTY OVER

02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:58.862
OTHER THINGS AND IF SOMEBODY

02:33:58.929 --> 02:34:00.931
HAD A PAIN AND SUFFERING ISSUE-

02:34:00.998 --> 02:34:02.099
THEY WERE NOT AFFORDED THE

02:34:02.166 --> 02:34:04.969
ABILITY TO FULLY HAVE REDRESS.

02:34:05.035 --> 02:34:07.905
IT IN THE TIME OF OUR FORTUNES

02:34:07.972 --> 02:34:09.807
HAVE. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON

02:34:09.873 --> 02:34:12.009
HOW MANY CASES WERE DELAYED

02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:13.944
DURING THE CODE EMERGENCY AND

02:34:14.011 --> 02:34:16.080
DIDN'T GET A PREFERENTIAL-

02:34:16.146 --> 02:34:18.082
TRIAL DATE OR HAVE FAILED TO

02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:20.517
HAVE THEIR TRIAL- I CAN SEE IF

02:34:20.584 --> 02:34:22.519
THERE IS DATA FROM THE COURTS

02:34:22.586 --> 02:34:25.155
THERE IS ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE I

02:34:25.222 --> 02:34:26.957
MEAN WE HAD SOMEBODY TESTIFY.

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:28.993
ONE PERSON JUST TO DEMONSTRATE

02:34:29.059 --> 02:34:30.728
HOW THAT IN FACT HAPPENED I

02:34:30.794 --> 02:34:32.029
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:35.432
ACCUMULATED IN A DATA. AMANDA

02:34:35.499 --> 02:34:36.634
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT BUT

02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:38.235
WE'LL CHECK WE'LL SEE IF

02:34:38.302 --> 02:34:39.770
ANYTHING EXISTS WILL PROVIDE

02:34:39.837 --> 02:34:41.005
WELL I THINK I THINK THAT WOULD

02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:42.506
BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE ESPECIALLY

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:45.442
AS WE'RE SITTING HERE TRYING TO

02:34:45.509 --> 02:34:46.276
MAKE POLICY THAT WE THINK IS.

02:34:46.343 --> 02:34:47.277
THE BEST WAY BETTER TO HAVE

02:34:47.344 --> 02:34:49.913
LIKE THE- YOU KNOW THE- THE

02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:51.081
NUMBERS WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

02:34:51.148 --> 02:34:52.883
HAPPENED. WE KNOW FOR A FACT IT

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:54.385
HAPPENED THAT'S WHAT THE

02:34:54.451 --> 02:34:56.654
WITNESS TESTIFIED TO WE CAN TRY

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:58.155
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NUMBERS

02:34:58.222 --> 02:34:59.823
WERE. OF HOW IT HAPPENED BUT WE

02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:01.592
KNOW IN FACT IT HAPPENED RIGHT

02:35:01.659 --> 02:35:04.361
BUT WE'VE KNOWN FOR. YEARS THAT

02:35:04.428 --> 02:35:05.829
THIS HAPPENS IT WE DO HAVE

02:35:05.896 --> 02:35:07.798
PLAINTIFF TO PASS AWAY DURING

02:35:07.865 --> 02:35:10.034
THE PENDENCY OF LITIGATION. AND

02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:11.502
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT IS WHAT

02:35:11.568 --> 02:35:13.170
WE HAVEN'T HAD A PANDEMIC IN

02:35:13.237 --> 02:35:15.305
WHICH THE COURTS ESSENTIALLY IN

02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:16.407
SOME PARTS OF THE STATE SHUT

02:35:16.473 --> 02:35:18.542
DOWN. OR DELAYED IN SUCH A

02:35:18.609 --> 02:35:20.077
SUBSTANTIAL MORE AND THAT'S MY

02:35:20.144 --> 02:35:21.979
POINT IS IF THIS IS A CODE THAT

02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:22.646
ISSUE THEN WE SHOULD HAVE SOME

02:35:22.713 --> 02:35:24.181
DATA. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US

02:35:24.248 --> 02:35:25.582
TO HAVE SOME DATE ON HOW HOW

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:29.186
MANY CASES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:30.054
OR IS THIS. SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:31.388
HAVE SEEN THAT THERE ARE CASES

02:35:31.455 --> 02:35:35.726
WHERE THIS DOES OCCUR- WE WILL

02:35:35.793 --> 02:35:38.962
WORK WITH YOU TO CSS- AND THEN

02:35:39.029 --> 02:35:40.197
I MEAN THE INSURANCE WANTED

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:42.199
INSURANCE ISSUE IS I THINK

02:35:42.266 --> 02:35:43.734
SOMETHING THAT'S ON EVERYONE'S

02:35:43.801 --> 02:35:45.703
MINDS IT INCLUDES. AT THE

02:35:45.769 --> 02:35:47.404
PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT ARE

02:35:47.471 --> 02:35:50.808
TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. YOUR DO

02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:52.976
YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT. THE

02:35:53.043 --> 02:35:55.212
INCREASE IN PREMIUMS MIGHT BE

02:35:55.279 --> 02:35:57.781
SEEN IF THIS WAS NOW. CHANGE IN

02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:59.149
THIS WAY AND TERMS HOW'S THAT

02:35:59.216 --> 02:36:03.654
GOING TO AFFECT. NO COVERAGE NO

02:36:03.721 --> 02:36:06.056
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THERE.

02:36:06.123 --> 02:36:07.925
HAVE BEEN ACTUARIAL SORE THINGS

02:36:07.991 --> 02:36:10.194
RUN BASED ON ON WHAT IT IS BUT

02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:12.129
ONE THING IS CLEAR THAT I WAS

02:36:12.196 --> 02:36:13.564
GONNA DRESSED IN THE CLOTHES

02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:16.366
THAT CAME UP IS THAT THIS DOES

02:36:16.433 --> 02:36:19.002
NOT IN ANY WAY ALTER MICRO THE

02:36:19.069 --> 02:36:21.105
CAP EXISTS TO CAP IS NOT

02:36:21.171 --> 02:36:23.774
ALTERED. AND SO TO READ

02:36:23.841 --> 02:36:28.112
ANYTHING INTO THAT IN REGARD TO

02:36:28.178 --> 02:36:30.881
INSURANCE RATE IS NOT CORRECT.

02:36:30.948 --> 02:36:32.816
OKAY WELL I'VE I APPRECIATE

02:36:32.883 --> 02:36:34.585
THOSE ANSWERS AND AGAIN I KNOW

02:36:34.651 --> 02:36:36.220
THIS IS COMING FROM A GOOD

02:36:36.286 --> 02:36:38.288
PLACE AND WELL INTENTIONED AND-

02:36:38.355 --> 02:36:39.757
CERTAINLY CAN UNDERSTAND AND

02:36:39.823 --> 02:36:42.826
SYMPATHIZE WITH THE SITUATIONS.

02:36:42.893 --> 02:36:44.294
WHERE THIS HAPPENS I GUESS JUST

02:36:44.361 --> 02:36:45.262
WHERE I FALL AS I THINK WE

02:36:45.329 --> 02:36:47.097
CURRENT HAVE CURRENT REMEDIES

02:36:47.164 --> 02:36:49.266
TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION. I

02:36:49.333 --> 02:36:50.300
DON'T THINK IT IS TRUE THAT YOU

02:36:50.367 --> 02:36:52.069
LOSE YOUR ENTIRE CLAIM YOU

02:36:52.136 --> 02:36:53.070
ACTUALLY JUST NOW HAVE A

02:36:53.137 --> 02:36:54.238
DIFFERENT CLAIM IN OR NOT

02:36:54.304 --> 02:36:55.439
REPRESENTING YOU LOSE YOUR

02:36:55.506 --> 02:36:57.241
ENTIRE CLIENT MORE REPRESENTING

02:36:57.307 --> 02:36:58.675
THAT YOU LOSE THE PEACE THAT IS

02:36:58.742 --> 02:37:00.711
PAIN AND SUFFERING. RIGHT AND

02:37:00.778 --> 02:37:02.980
SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE STILL

02:37:03.046 --> 02:37:04.915
THOSE ARE AND FOR ABUSES IT

02:37:04.982 --> 02:37:06.683
WHICH I CERTAINLY. I THINK WE

02:37:06.750 --> 02:37:08.252
ALL OF WAR IF THERE ARE ABUSES

02:37:08.318 --> 02:37:10.487
WE ALSO HAVE REMEDIES. YOU KNOW

02:37:10.554 --> 02:37:11.989
FOR THAT IN THE SYSTEM AS WELL

02:37:12.055 --> 02:37:13.357

THEM TO- FROM MY COLLEAGUE MY

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:29.106
CONCERNS ARE JUST HAVING DATA

02:37:29.173 --> 02:37:30.274
AND KNOWING YOU KNOW HOW MANY

02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.676
CASES- YOU KNOW WHERE FAILED

02:37:32.743 --> 02:37:34.178
DURING CULTIVATED I THINK WAS

02:37:34.244 --> 02:37:36.113
MARCH TWENTY TWENTY A NOT TO BE

02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:38.048
HEARD OR RESOLVED BEFORE THEN

02:37:38.115 --> 02:37:39.516
JUST TO SEE IF I WAS LATE THIS

02:37:39.583 --> 02:37:41.618
IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE BUT YOU

02:37:41.685 --> 02:37:44.388
KNOW IS IT FIVE IS A FIVE

02:37:44.454 --> 02:37:45.055
HUNDRED I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE

02:37:45.122 --> 02:37:46.156
LOOKING AT LEGISLATION LIKE

02:37:46.223 --> 02:37:47.357
THIS I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF WE CAN

02:37:47.424 --> 02:37:48.725
FIGURE OUT HOW MANY CASES WERE

02:37:48.792 --> 02:37:50.594
DENIED DURING THAT TIME. AND

02:37:50.661 --> 02:37:51.461
THEN AGAIN WHEN IT COMES TO

02:37:51.528 --> 02:37:54.031
BECAUSE- WHEN IT COMES TO COST

02:37:54.097 --> 02:37:55.899
ESPECIALLY WITH INSURANCE MY

02:37:55.966 --> 02:37:57.100
CONCERN IS IT USUALLY ENDS UP

02:37:57.167 --> 02:37:58.769
GOING DOWN TO THE CUSTOMER ONE

02:37:58.836 --> 02:37:59.970
WHERE THE OTHER STARTS HERE AND

02:38:00.037 --> 02:38:00.871
THEN THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:02.773
TO AND IS YOU KNOW THE HOUSE IS

02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:04.808
GOING TO BE A COST EFFECTIVE SO

02:38:04.875 --> 02:38:06.677
I THINK JUST DATA WOULD BE-

02:38:06.743 --> 02:38:07.644
WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF YOU'LL BE

02:38:07.711 --> 02:38:09.179

STAFF AND MY OFFICE. A. N. I

02:38:11.415 --> 02:38:13.150
THINK JUST TO REPEAT TO AND

02:38:13.217 --> 02:38:15.752
MAYBE EVEN EXPAND IN SOME CASES

02:38:15.819 --> 02:38:17.120
THIS DATA WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

02:38:17.187 --> 02:38:19.990
COLLECTED IF SOMEBODY WAS NOT

02:38:20.057 --> 02:38:21.992
ALLOWED TO FILE FOR PREFERENCE

02:38:22.059 --> 02:38:23.260
FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY'RE NOT

02:38:23.327 --> 02:38:24.528
IN THE SYSTEM FOR NOT HAVING

FORWARD AND SAY I WAS NOT

02:38:29.833 --> 02:38:31.902
ALLOWED TO DO THAT BUT- BUT IT

02:38:31.969 --> 02:38:34.104
IT WOULDN'T EXIST IN A STANDARD

02:38:34.171 --> 02:38:36.006
WAY OF COURT STATISTICS TO BE

02:38:36.073 --> 02:38:37.608
ABLE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM.

02:38:37.674 --> 02:38:39.443
HAVING SAID THAT WE WILL LOOK

02:38:39.509 --> 02:38:43.847

02:38:49.953 --> 02:38:52.723
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND NOT

02:38:52.789 --> 02:38:53.957
TO CONFLATE IS YOU

02:38:54.024 --> 02:38:55.659
APPROPRIATELY STATED THIS IS A

02:38:55.726 --> 02:38:58.428
CODE ISSUE THE APPLE FIBER CODE

02:38:58.495 --> 02:38:59.496
BUT THERE IS AN UNDERLYING

02:38:59.563 --> 02:39:02.466
ISSUE THAT EXIST REGARDLESS.

02:39:02.532 --> 02:39:04.701
AND SOME OF THE SPECULATION ON

02:39:04.768 --> 02:39:06.270
INSURANCE RATES IS JUST THAT

02:39:06.336 --> 02:39:09.640
IT'S SPECULATIVE AND IN A NOTE

02:39:09.706 --> 02:39:11.742
REALLY WHAT THAT IMPACT WAS

02:39:11.808 --> 02:39:15.646
GOING TO BE BUT BECAUSE THESE

02:39:15.712 --> 02:39:17.080
ARE UNDERLYING EXISTING.

02:39:17.147 --> 02:39:19.416
LIABILITIES THAT DOES NOT

02:39:19.483 --> 02:39:21.618
CHANGE THE CALCULATION REALLY

02:39:21.685 --> 02:39:23.887
HOW LONG IT WOULD BE. AND FOR

02:39:23.954 --> 02:39:25.355
THOSE ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO

02:39:25.422 --> 02:39:27.057
PARTICIPATED HEARINGS THAT WE

02:39:27.124 --> 02:39:28.759
HAD JOINTLY WITH THE SENATE.

02:39:28.825 --> 02:39:30.594
EARLIER IN THIS YEAR YOU KNOW

02:39:30.661 --> 02:39:33.263
THAT THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:33.864
COLLECTING FROM THE COURTS HAS

02:39:33.931 --> 02:39:36.934
BEEN. A BIT SPARSE AND TRYING

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.136
TO COLLECT EXACTLY THESE KINDS

02:39:39.202 --> 02:39:41.038
OF DATA IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

02:39:41.104 --> 02:39:42.873
ASKING FOR TO UNDERSTAND IMPACT

02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:46.276
SOUGHT. THE TWO LADIES AND-

02:39:46.343 --> 02:39:48.178
WHAT HAPPENED WITHIN THE COURT

02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:49.513
SYSTEM AND ONE THING THAT WE DO

02:39:49.579 --> 02:39:53.417
KNOW IS THAT DIFFERENT COUNTIES.

02:39:53.483 --> 02:39:55.452
THE COUNTER DIFFERENT IMPACTS

02:39:55.519 --> 02:39:57.154
AND THERE THERE'S A WIDE

02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:59.222
VARIETY OF CROSS CALIFORNIA BUT

02:39:59.289 --> 02:40:00.857
THAT SHOULD NOT DISTRACT US

02:40:00.924 --> 02:40:03.427
FROM THE NEED. TO LOOK AT THE

02:40:03.493 --> 02:40:05.562
UNDERLYING POLICY OF WHETHER OR

02:40:05.629 --> 02:40:09.266
NOT. THESE KINDS OF REMEDIES

02:40:09.333 --> 02:40:11.234
DIE WITH THE PLAINTIFFS AND

02:40:11.301 --> 02:40:12.369
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT

02:40:12.436 --> 02:40:14.004
AND I THINK THIS IS VERY

02:40:14.071 --> 02:40:16.640
APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION AT THIS

02:40:16.707 --> 02:40:17.474
POINT AND A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

02:40:17.541 --> 02:40:20.744
OF POLICY. FOR THE BETTER FOR

02:40:20.811 --> 02:40:21.411

OR- IN THIS CASE DIED BECAUSE

02:40:27.217 --> 02:40:30.587

03:04:01.530 --> 03:04:03.232
CHILDREN IN FAMILY COURT

03:04:03.298 --> 03:04:04.533
SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL DOES TWO

03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:05.434
THINGS THAT I THINK ARE LONG

03:04:05.501 --> 03:04:08.237
OVERDUE FIRST SB SIX FIFTY FOUR

03:04:08.303 --> 03:04:10.038
PREVENTS A CHILD'S TESTIMONY-

03:04:10.105 --> 03:04:10.873
FROM BEING GIVEN IN THE

03:04:10.939 --> 03:04:12.141
PRESENCE OF THE PARTY SEEKING

03:04:12.207 --> 03:04:13.842
CUSTODY SUCH AS A CHILD'S

03:04:13.909 --> 03:04:15.644
PARENTS UNLESS IT IS SEEN AS

03:04:15.711 --> 03:04:17.312
NECESSARY. THAT WOULD REVERSE

03:04:17.379 --> 03:04:19.681
THE ORDER OF THE PRIORITIZATION

03:04:19.748 --> 03:04:20.682
RIGHT NOW WITH THE DEFAULT IS

03:04:20.749 --> 03:04:22.918
OFTEN- THE IDEA THAT THE CHILD

03:04:22.985 --> 03:04:24.353
WILL GIVE TESTIMONY IN FRONT OF

03:04:24.420 --> 03:04:27.055
PARENTS SOMETHING THEY CAN BE

03:04:27.122 --> 03:04:28.957
VERY TRAUMATIZING- SECOND- AND

03:04:29.024 --> 03:04:30.292
I THINK IT IS. YOU KNOW CLEARLY

03:04:30.359 --> 03:04:31.460
USEFUL AND NECESSARY FOR

03:04:31.527 --> 03:04:33.529
CHILDREN TO TESTIFY. SOMETIMES

03:04:33.595 --> 03:04:34.930
IT IS NECESSARY TO FOR THOSE

03:04:34.997 --> 03:04:36.031
THESE CHILDREN TO TESTIFY IN

03:04:36.098 --> 03:04:38.233
FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS. BUT

03:04:38.300 --> 03:04:39.935
ATTORNEYS AND CHILD ADVOCATES

03:04:40.002 --> 03:04:42.371
HAVE REPORTED ACROSS THE BOARD

03:04:42.438 --> 03:04:44.206
THAT. I'M GENERALLY SPEAKING

03:04:44.273 --> 03:04:45.607
TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF ONE'S

03:04:45.674 --> 03:04:47.576
PARENTS AT THIS AGE IN IN THESE

03:04:47.643 --> 03:04:49.311
CONTENTIOUS. CUSTODY BATTLES

03:04:49.378 --> 03:04:51.480
CAN CAUSE LONG TERM EMOTIONAL

03:04:51.547 --> 03:04:54.082
DISTRESS AND HARM. CHILDREN

03:04:54.149 --> 03:04:55.584
HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD BUT WE

03:04:55.651 --> 03:04:56.351
BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE

03:04:56.418 --> 03:04:58.086
DONE IN SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND

03:04:58.153 --> 03:04:59.655
SO AS SUCH THE FIRST COMPONENT

03:04:59.721 --> 03:05:00.355
THIS BILL ENSURES THAT

03:05:00.422 --> 03:05:02.391
CHILDREN. ARE ONLY PLACED IN A

03:05:02.458 --> 03:05:03.425
SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE FORCED

03:05:03.492 --> 03:05:05.060
TO TESTIFY FROM THEIR PARENTS

03:05:05.127 --> 03:05:06.829
WHEN IT'S DEEMED NECESSARY. AND

03:05:06.895 --> 03:05:07.996
ALSO CLARIFIES THAT CHILDREN

03:05:08.063 --> 03:05:10.165
HAVE A RIGHT TO CHANGE THEIR

03:05:10.232 --> 03:05:10.732
MIND ABOUT HOW THEY WISH TO

03:05:10.799 --> 03:05:13.302
PROVIDE INPUT. SECONDLY SB SIX

TO CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATION.

03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:20.042
AND EXTENDS THEM TO

03:05:20.108 --> 03:05:21.543
UNSUPERVISED VISITATION.

03:05:21.610 --> 03:05:23.445
CURRENTLY JUDGES MUST CONSIDER

03:05:23.512 --> 03:05:24.446
A HISTORY OF ABUSE OR DRUG

03:05:24.513 --> 03:05:25.948
ADDICTION WHEN PLACING CHILDREN

03:05:26.014 --> 03:05:27.449
IN THE CUSTODY OF. INDIVIDUALS

03:05:27.516 --> 03:05:29.618
WITH THESE BACKGROUNDS. AND IF

03:05:29.685 --> 03:05:30.853
A JUDGE PLACES A CHILD IN THE

03:05:30.919 --> 03:05:31.887
CUSTODY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AN

03:05:31.954 --> 03:05:33.188
ABUSIVE. BACKGROUND THEY MUST

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:34.223
STATE THEIR REASONS ON THE

03:05:34.289 --> 03:05:36.625
RECORD- THIS STATUS QUO INSURES

03:05:36.692 --> 03:05:37.826
THAT DOCUMENTATION OF THESE

03:05:37.893 --> 03:05:39.628
DETERMINATIONS ARE CAPPED. A

03:05:39.695 --> 03:05:41.263
DECISION IS MADE IN THIS HELPS

03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:42.965
TO SAVE LIVES. BUT THE SAME

03:05:43.031 --> 03:05:44.333
REQUIREMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO

UNSUPERVISED VISITATIONS WHICH

03:05:46.068 --> 03:05:47.603
