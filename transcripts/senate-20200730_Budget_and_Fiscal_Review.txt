MAINTENANCE WORKERS AND THIRTEEN OPERATING ENGINEERS. THE ALTHOUGH THE STATE RATIFIED THE BARGAINING UNIT TWELVE AND SUCCESSOR AMMO YOU PRIOR TO JULY FIRST I YOU ARE YOU ARE WE DID NOT HAVE THE AGREEMENT RATIFIED BY JULY ONE. AS SUCH THIS EYELINER WAS STATE BARGAINING UNIT TWELVE IS RELATED TO THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOR LOW POLICY AND IMPACTS OF THIS POLICY FOR JULY TWENTY TWENTY. THAT EACH FULL TIME EMPLOYEE. UNIT DURING THE JULY TWENTY EIGHT. WILL BE A OUR OF PROGRAM HOURS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT AND THAT THE EMPLOYEES BEING SUBJECT TO A NINE POINT 23% FOR LOW PAYROLL DEDUCTION WHILE CONTINUING TO FIND THEIR OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AND THE SIDE LETTER WHAT STATE BARGAINING UNIT THIRTEEN FOR THE TERM OF JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO REPRESENTS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SAVINGS OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS SIX POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FIND. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND IT INCLUDES A NINE POINT 23% PAYROLL DEDUCTION SIXTEEN HOURS CREDITED MONTHLY FOR THE PERSONALLY PROGRAM GETTING IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY. S. AS AN EXAMPLE. MISSION PRE FUNDING HAD. I'M WITH THE AUGUST WHEN TWENTY EIGHT AND- SO IN TOTAL ALL OF THE AGREEMENTS INCLUDING THE ONES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. I RESULT IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SAVINGS AT TWO POINT SEVEN FOUR BILLION OR WHICH IS ONE POINT NINE THREE BILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THIS BILL ALSO MAKES A CONFORMING STATUTORY CHANGES FOR THE BERRIES AGREEMENTS THAT WERE ENTERED INTO BY JUNE THIRTIETH BY THE STATE AND THE VARIOUS EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING STATE BARGAINING UNITS. 778-910-1216 EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN. THAT WERE FIRED FIRST AB ONE NINETY. AND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHERE NOTICED OF ALL OF THESE AGREEMENTS ON JULY EIGHT. TIMES AND LASTLY THIS BILL APPROPRIATE FIVE POINT NINE MILLION THREE POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES RELATED TO START STATE BARGAINING UNITS TO SEVEN EIGHT TWELVE THIRTEEN AND SIXTEEN. BUT I AM AVAILABLE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT MISS HOFFMAN QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR MORE LAW. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO. ANOTHER ONE ASK QUESTIONS YOU JUST MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS AND MAYBE- MISS HOLDEN COULD CONFIRM WHETHER I'M UNDERSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF THESE CONTRACTS- BUT CURRENTLY THE STATE PAYS- INTO THE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN BUT IT'S DONE THROUGH A 4% WITHHOLDING. FROM EACH EMPLOYEE A SINCE WERE. STATING THAT WERE REDUCING THE SALARIES BY NINE POINT 23% BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT REUIRING THE WITHHOLDING OF 4% WERE ACTUALLY MAYBE JUST HAVING OR A NET REDUCTION OF. FIVE POINT TWO THREE PERCENT. AND IT APPEARS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TAKING A REDUCTION IN HOURS THOSE HOURS ARE BEING. SET ASIDE AND- A DEFERRED PROGRAM TO LIKE GET SICK LEAVE OR VACATION UNUSED TIME SO I'M WONDERING. ABOUT TWO THINGS ONE- IF WE'RE NOT PAYING IN THE 4% THAT MEANS% THAT THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR THE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN IS INCREASING BY A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE- SUPPOSED TO HAVE AS AN ASSUME RATE OF RETURN FOR THE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN. BUT IF IT'S THE SAME AS CALPERS THAT WOULD BE RATE. THAT THE GOVERNMENT- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BORROWING AT FOR TEN YEAR TREASURIES AT POINT SIX. SO IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE. DEAD AND WERE. ACTUALLY NOT REDUCING WAGES WERE JUST DEFERRING WAGES FROM WHAT I READ. SO I'M JUST KIND OF CONCERNED THAT MIGHT ALSO BE AN INTERESTING LOAN THAT WERE WERE ACTUALLY TAKING OUTSIDE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE COMPONENTS RECORD THAT I MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR. AND SO- EITHER FINANCE WE ALSO HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE LET DOWN WITH THE OFFICE WHO ARE AVAILABLE IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO LEARN RESPOND TO THE SENATOR. MERRY ALTERMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I AM IS SO FOR THE EMPLOYEE- PAD AMOUNTS SO IT VARIES BY BARGAINING UNITS- I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT AMOUNTS IT RANGES FROM ABOUT 2% SIEU I BELIEVE THE HIGHEST IS FOUR POINT. 6% A SO YES THOSE WOULD BE SO. FOR THE TERMS OF THE- THAT WORK RETAIL I'M SOME OF THEM ARE FOR ONE YEAR SOME OF THEM HAVE AGREED TO TWO YEARS. AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE FAR GONE AND DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ESTIMATE TO BE SIX HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILLION IN TOTAL FOR ALL OF THE BARGAINING UNITS. I WHICH IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION GENERAL FINDS. AIRLINES I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME BUT THE EM RATE OF RETURN FOR THE HEALTH PLANS. THE ANNUAL EVALUATION. THANK JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS THE LAST ONE IT WAS I BELIEVE AROUND FOUR POINT 25% IT WAS IN THE 4% AREA SO IT'S SLOW WORK IT SEEMS RATE OF RETURN NINE HELP. AT THE MOMENT. SO AB I'M JUST KIND CARRIER WHO'S WHO TO GO. THESE CONTRACTS IS IT STAFF IN THE GOVERNOR'S FOR YOU RETAIN AN INDEPENDENT. SAY LAW FIRM TO NEGOTIATE. AS NEGOTIATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION I'M CALLIE CHARS DE DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DETERMINE IS BY VOTING FOR THIS I'M NOT REALLY REDUCING ANYTHING I'M JUST DEFERRING. COSTS I WILL STE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY THAT THE STATE WILL HAVE TO PAY THEIR OKAY COSTS IN SUMMER ALONG THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY MAYBE WHEN. HE'S EMPLOYEES RETIRE- THEIR BACK WAGES THAT WERE SET ASIDE TIME. I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE. RECEIVING ANYTHING WE JUST IS IT JUST A TIMING FIND. THE FINES ARE BEING SAGE I'M AND IT IMMEDIATELY AND THE CURRENT YEAR. AND STAFF ARE RECEIVING HOURS THAT THEY CAN TAKE EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. I'M AND WITH THE CATAMOUNTS BEING SUSPENDED FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS. AND THAT WOULD GO TOWARDS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE A THIRTY YEAR PLANS YOU PAY OFF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. SO AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD DELAYED THE THIRTY YEAR AND. PROJECTION WE DON'T HAVE AN UPDATED. IF THE CONCLUDE MADAM CHAIR AT THE COUNTY BOARD WE- STAY WITH HOPE HAVE HAVING A WERE HOLD FOR OKAY IN THE COUNTY JUST PAY FOR ITSELF. SO THIS MIGHT BE IN FUTURE YEARS IF THINGS CONTINUE TO BE A LITTLE TIGHT. IT MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE A REYES WITHOUT GIVING REYES YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND- PULL OUT THE HALF TWO TO FOUR POINT 6% AND THEN HAVE THE STATE PAY FOR ITSELF SO WE STAY ON TRACK AND WE'RE NOT DEPENDENT ON SOME OF THESE CYCLES- BECAUSE THIS IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY FROM. MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S OVER A SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND NOW IT'S GONNA GROW CLOSE TO NINETY BILLION THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR. DOES IT FOLLOW US- ESPECIALLY OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS ART. EIGHT I'D LIKE TO SEE MAYBE EVEN A RENEGOTIATION OF OUR OKAY A PLAN. A WE DID AT THE COUNTY. JUST FOR SOME MINOR TWEAKS THAT WAS A GROUP THEY WERE GREETED BY THE BARGAINING UNITS AND WE REDUCED OUR INPUT OF LIABILITY BY 71% SO. 71% TIMES NINETY IS A GOOD SIXTY BILLION WITH THE TAKE OFF THE BALANCE SHEETS OF. THEY HAVE BEEN TO AT THAT TO BECAUSE THIS IS CERTAINLY A- VERY HIGH ANNUAL COSTS THAT WILL BE BORN FOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR CALLING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I ALSO TO- JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON MAYBE A LITTLE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAD WHEN I WAS A CASE SUPERVISORS WELL. TO THE DIFFERING THOSE OUT- SO A LOT OF THOSE EMPLOYEES WILL GET STEP INCREASES ALONG THE WAY. AND THEY WILL ALSO. MAYBE IF YOUR LONG COURSE THAT YOU BECOME A SERGEANT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BANK THAT UP AND WHEN YOU GO TO RETIRE. ON YOUR TO HIGHER SALARY AND SO REALLY YOUR YOUR CALL FOR YOU YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT BASED AT THE TIME WHEN THEY SET IT ASIDE YOU'RE ACTUALLY BASED. AT THE TIME. WHEN HE RETIRES SO THAT'S A DOUBLE HIT TO THE BUDGET IN FUTURE YEARS SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD TAKE AND IT. INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL. BECAUSE YOUR REAL REALLY GETTING A DOUBLE HIT BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO GET. THEY'RE GONNA GET CALLS ALONG THE WAY AND ALSO GOING TO GET. MAYBE A STEP INCREASE IN SO WHEN YOU RETIRE YOU YOU'RE AT YOUR HIGHEST YOU'RE PAID OUT. AND IF IT'S TEN YEARS FROM NOW. THAT COULD BE A HECK OF A LOT MORE MONEY IN NY TIMES AT TIMES. THE MOUNT EMPLOYEES THAT ARE GOOD THIS A FAX- THIS IS NOT GOOD BUSINESS TO DO THAT IT IS IT COULD BE IT IS NOT SAID AT THE- AT THE RATE TODAY. IS THE SENATE THEIR FUTURE RETIREMENT DATE SO. THAT THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT THE LA OWES OFFICE IN THE BUDGET. FOLKS SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. WHEN THEY PUT TOGETHER A PLAN LIKE THIS. THANK YOU SIR. QUESTION FOR MEMBERS. NO HAN SEEING NO HANDS REYES FROM MY REMOTE MEMBERS IN THE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS HERE IN THE CHAMBERS HALF QUESTION. SENATOR KNOWLEDGE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION SO THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE HOURS BAIT- IN THEIR RETIREMENT ARE THEY REQUIRED TO BURN THOSE HOURS- NOW OR THEY ALLOWED TO CARRY THOSE HOURS ON BECAUSE THAT WILL IMPACT AS WELL RETIREMENT IF THEY CARRY THOSE HOURS YEAR YEAR FORWARD. AND SO IN ALL OF THE AGREEMENTS- IT STATES THAT HE PERSONALLY OF OURS ARE TO BE USED PRIOR TO ALL OTHER LEAVE- EXCEPT FOR SICK LEAVE AT THAT CHOOSING OF THE EMPLOYEE. AND SO IT IS EXPECTED THAT ALL THESE OUR SHOULD BE USED FIRST. I'M IN AND EMPLOYEESEPARATE AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO USE HOURS PRIOR TO SEPARATION THEN THEY WOULD BE CASHED OUT. THANK YOU.
