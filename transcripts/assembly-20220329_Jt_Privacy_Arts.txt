AND WELCOME EVERYBODY TO TODAY'S JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING HOSTED BY THE COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THE COMMITTEE ON ARTS ENTERTAINMENT SPORTS TOURISM AND INTERNET MEDIA THAT IS A MOUTHFUL LET ME START BY THANKING ALL OF OUR PANELISTS FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A TESTED YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES AND TRAVELED FROM FAR AND IN SOME CASES FROM VERY FAR DISTANCES TO BE WITH US AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE IT I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR INCREDIBLE COMMITTEE STAFF FROM BOTH COMMITTEES FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARING THE SERGEANTS THE INCREDIBLE FOLKS AT THE RULES COMMITTEE AND THE OTHER CAPITAL SUPPORT OFFICERS WHO HAVE WORKED BEHIND THE SCENES TO CHORE THIS HEARING RUN SMOOTHLY AND FINALLY WANT TO THANK MY FELLOW MEMBERS AND EVERYONE HERE IN ATTENDANCE FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS BIPARTISAN ISSUE OF STATE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE WHICH IS PROTECTING CHILDREN ONLINE IN RECENT MONTHS WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC DISCOURSE ON THIS CRITICAL TOPIC IN HIS RECENT STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS PRESIDENT BIDEN URGED ACTION TO PROTECT KIDS ONLINE NOTING WE MUST HOLD SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE NATIONAL EXPERIMENT THEY'RE CONDUCTING ON OUR CHILDREN FOR PROFIT IT'S TIME TO STRENGTHEN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS BAN TARGETED ADVERTISING TO CHILDREN DEMAND THAT TECH COMPANIES STOP COLLECTING PERSONAL DATA ON OUR CHILDREN JUST LAST MONTH THE UNITED STATES SURGEON GENERAL FOR BACK MURPHY TESTIFIED BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SENATE REGARDING OUR NATION'S YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WHICH HE DUBBED A CRISIS OF LONELINESS AND HELPLESSNESS DR MURPHY STATED THE RECENT UBIQUITY OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ESPECIALLY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAS HAD HARMFUL EFFECTS ON MANY CHILDREN THAT WENT OUT OF THE A BENEFIT TO OUR LIVES IN IMPORTANT WAYS THESE PLATFORMS HAVE ALSO EXACERBATED FEELINGS OF ISOLATION AND FOR FUTILITY FOR SOME YOUTH THEY REDUCE TIME FOR POSITIVE IN PERSON ACTIVITIES PITTED KIDS AGAINST EACH OTHER REINFORCE NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS LIKE PULLING AN EXCLUSION IMPEDED HEALTHY HABITS IN UNDERMINE THE SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT KIDS NEED TO THRIVE THE PRESIDENT'S A DOCTOR MURPHY STATEMENTS COME INTO THE AFTERMATH OF EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY THE FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER FRANCIS HOW CAN WHO TESTIFIED THAT FACEBOOK WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO RECRUIT KIDS TO THEIR PLATFORMS DESPITE HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PRODUCTS DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN THE TESTIMONY REVEALED THAT THESE HARMFUL IMPACTS OFTEN ARE FACILITATED BY INTENTIONAL DESIGN CHOICES SEEKING TO MAXIMIZE ENGAGEMENT IN PURSUIT OF CORPORATE PROFITS HER TESTIMONY ALSO REINFORCED WELL FOUNDED CONCERNS ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA IN PARTICULAR IMPACTS YOUNG PEOPLE ON A WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES INCLUDING BODY IMAGE ANOREXIA ADDICTION ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION FRANKLY I'M CONCERNED I'M CONCERNED BOTH AS A LEGISLATOR AND AS A PARENT OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES WE'VE PASSED NUMEROUS LAWS BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL TO PROTECT CHILDREN ONLINE BUT LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY OF DOCTOR MERCY OF FRANCIS HOW CAN OF MY CONSTITUENTS AND EXPERIENCING THIS FIRST HAND AS A PARENT I'M NOT SURE THOSE LAWS ARE PROTECTING YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE WAYS WE INTENDED AS A PARENT I BELIEVE THAT MY CONCERN REFLECTS THOSE OF PARENTS IN THE STATE I WANT MY CHILDREN TO BE SAFE ONLINE THIS IS A COMPLICATED IN A SCARY TIME TO BE A PARENT AT THE VERY LEAST I WANT TO EXERCISE SOME CONTROL OVER THE CONTENT TO WHICH MY CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED AND I WANT THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE MATERIALS AND TOOLS AS THEY LEARN HOW TO RESPONSIBLY NAVIGATE THE DIGITAL WORLD THEMSELVES A FEW FINAL OBSERVATIONS WE HAVE INTENTIONALLY ENTITLED THIS HEARING CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WHICH REFLECTS BOTH THE TREMENDOUS BENEFITS OF INNOVATION IN THE STATE THE BENEFITS TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN FAMILY OF TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND HARMS AND I BELIEVE THAT ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE CALIFORNIA HAS BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN OBLIGATION TO LEAD AS A WORLD LEADER IN TECHNOLOGY MANY OF THESE ARE HOME GROWN CALIFORNIA COMPANIES THAT ARE CREATING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN ENRICH PEOPLE'S LIVES BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WE ALSO HAVE A POTENTIOMETER OPPORTUNITY HERE TO ACT IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE ONLY ISSUES ON WHICH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON DC AND SACRAMENTO HAVE FOUND COMMON CAUSE I ALSO WANT TO SET OUT THE SCOPE OF THIS HEARING THERE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF ISSUES INVOLVING PROTECTING CHILDREN ONLINE -- CRIMINAL ACTS INCLUDING CHILD EXPLOITATION HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE SALE OF DRUGS FRAUD AND SO ON THOSE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES BUT MANY OF THOSE ISSUES ARE IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND WHILE THEY OVERLAP WITH A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY WE'RE GONNA TRY TO FOCUS OUR CONVERSATION ON EXPERIENCES WHILE NOT ILLEGAL THAT CAN IMPACT CHILDREN ONLINE IMPACT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IN THEIR PHYSICAL WELL BEING AT THE CONCLUSION OF EACH PANEL WE WILL OPEN THE DISCUSSION TO MEMBERS SO MEMBERS PLEASE RESERVE YOUR QUESTIONS FOR THE PANELISTS INTEL THEN AND WE WILL ALSO SET ASIDE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE END OF THIS HEARING I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY WILL BE INFORMATIVE FOR US AS A COMMITTEE AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE MORE BROADLY AS WE WORK TO COLLECTIVELY CREATE A SAFER DIGITAL WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN WITHOUT IT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH THE CHAIR OF THE ARTS ENTERTAINMENT SPORTS TOURISM AN INTERNET COMEDIAN FOR HER OPENING REMARKS I AM THAT I ECHO MY CO CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL'S REMARKS WHEN WE MAKE WHICH MAKES CLEAR THAT ALL WITNESSES AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY SWIM AND THE PUBLIC WATERS CHANGED BY THE REVELATIONS OF FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER FRANCIS HELGHAN QUOTING FROM -- THE BACK PAPER HOW CAN SUCCULENTS AND TESTIMONY PORTRAYS THE EXTENT OF FACEBOOK'S KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ON CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO RECRUIT CHILDREN ON TO THE PLATFORM NONE THE LESS THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND REMINDS US THAT CHILDREN CAN BE ADDICTED TO SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THE DICTION CAMBIUM IN A PARADE BY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THE HEARING BACKGROUND INFORMS US THAT WHILE MOST SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OFFICIALLY PROHIBIT CHILDREN UNDER THIRTEEN FROM REGISTERING AS USER USERS MANY MANY CHILDREN UNDER THIRTEEN DO MANAGE TO REGISTER ON THE PLATFORMS AND ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS AND CATER TO THIS AGE GROUP DESPITE THIS PROHIBITION AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WE TALK ABOUT OPPORTUNISM CHALLENGES AND WE LOOK BACK IN THE LAST TWO YEARS YOU KNOW I THINK THE WON'T OTHERS THERE'S A FLIP SIDE OF ALL THIS WHERE WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN BUT WE KNOW THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE SERVED OUR CHILDREN I PERSONALLY DON'T ALLOW MY KIDS ON INSTAGRAM FACEBOOK TECH TOP SNAPCHAT I DON'T ALLOW THAT AS A PARENT MY KIDS ARE FOURTEEN ELEVEN AND I THINK I'VE AS A LEGISLATOR I THINK I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THE HUMAN TRAFFIC INSIDE AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH MY KIDS AND SO THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ON THOSE PLATFORMS THE PLATFORMS LIKE DISCORD OR YOU TO MY DAUGHTER TAUTER CROCHET LAST WEEK WHILE I WAS UP HERE TELL US ALL HOW TO CROCHET A BECAUSE YOU WATCH A TWO MINUTE VIDEO ON YOUTUBE SO THERE ARE BENEFITS OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SO HOW DO WE KEEP THE BENEFITS AND THAT INNOVATION BUT HOW DO WE THEN REALLY PROTECT OUR KIDS FROM THE KIND OF SHADOW SIDE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT'S THE BALANCE I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S CONSUMPTION WE KNOW THIS DEPENDENCE ON IT SO HOW DO WE TAKE THESE FORMING BRAINS AND AND ENSURE THAT ALL PARTIES WHETHER THAT'S PARENTS SCHOOLS GOVERNMENT BY THE PLATFORMS THEMSELVES ALL ARE ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION TO PROTECT OUR KIDS AND I THINK THERE'S MORE WE COULD DO AND THAT'S THE QUESTION HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET OUT OF TODAY'S HEARING IS HOW DO WE BALANCE THAT ALL OUT AND SPECIFICALLY I HAVE THAT I HAVE TO WHAT SHOULD WE AT THE STATE LEVEL TWO I KNOW I'VE DONE ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING -- WEBINARS FOR PARENTS AND MY DISTRICT WITH OUR LOCAL DA ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO EDUCATE PARENTS AND SOME OF THE STUFF THAT HAPPENS IS INCREDIBLY DISTURBING SO WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE CAN HAVE ESPECIALLY AT WHEN I LOOK AT MIKE LONG COMMITTEE NAME WE JOKE THAT THEY GAVE ME A COMMITTEE NAME LONGER THAN MY ACTUAL NAME -- AND SO BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT INTERNET MEDIA INTERNET MEDIA IS REALLY THE CONTENT SIDE OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE INTERNET AND THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SO I'M LOOKING AT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AS A CHAIR AND REALLY WELCOME THE MEMBERS OF MY COMMITTEE HERE WHO -- FOR JOINING US AND REALLY PARTICIPATING IN THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- CHAIR FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON SO MANY ISSUES AND ALSO WANT TO WELCOME ASSEMBLYWOMAN CRISTINA GARCIA WHO I KNOW HAS AN INTEREST IN A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AS WELL PANEL TO -- COME UP AND JOIN US AND -- THEY ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING HOW DIGITAL MEDIA AFFECTS THE EXPERIENCES AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE A SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY TO INCORPORATE THE VOICES OF YOUNG PEOPLE INTO OUR HEARING WE'LL BEGIN WITH VICKY HARRISON WHO IS THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT THE STANFORD CENTER FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING SHE HOLDS A MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK IN MANAGES OVER A DOZEN PROJECTS PROMOTING EARLY INTERVENTION STIGMA REDUCTION AND INCREASED ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AGES TWELVE TO TWENTY FIVE MS HARRISON WELCOME YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK M. CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO ME AS A CITIZEN A PARENT AND AS A PUBLIC HEALTH SOCIAL WORKER WHOSE WORK FOCUSES ON SUPPORTING THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS AND FAMILIES RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA USE ON YOUTH AND RISING CONCERN ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS WE'VE RECEIVED AN ADVISORY FROM THE U. S. SURGEON GENERAL AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION FROM THREE NATIONAL LEADING CHILDREN'S HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS AND A CALL TO ACTION FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN IN HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS FROM MY VANTAGE POINT WORKING AS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR WITHIN THE FIELD OF YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH I CAN CONFIRM THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS REAL AND HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR YEARS THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA IS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS CRISIS IS STILL UNCLEAR AND MUCH MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE HEAVIEST USERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA OUR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHOSE DEVELOPING BRAINS AND LIMITED LIFE EXPERIENCE LEAVE THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS OF MEDIA USE ON PLATFORMS NOT DESIGNED WITH THEIR BEST INTEREST IN MIND THERE'S NO TURNING BACK TO AN ERA WHEN THESE INNOVATIONS WERE NOT EMBEDDED IN THE DAILY EXPERIENCES OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE OR IN OUR SOCIAL FABRIC FROM COMMERCE TO EDUCATION TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS ITSELF BUT WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE COURSE AND RENEW OUR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BUILD SAFER AND HEALTHIER ONLINE COMMUNITIES LET'S FIRST TAKE A MOMENT TO CONSIDER WHAT A TYPICAL ONLINE EXPERIENCE LOOKS LIKE FOR A TEAM TODAY THE TECH THEIR FRIENDS ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY BOTH ONE ON ONE OR IN MULTIPLE GROUP CHATS THEY'LL DECOMPRESS IN BETWEEN CLASSES WORKSHOPS OR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES BY SCROLLING THROUGH THEIR FEEDS USUALLY ACROSS FORTY FIVE DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PER DAY THE LIKE COMMENT AND SHARE INSPIRING STORIES OR FUNNY MEMES AND POSTS PHOTOS THAT THEY RE TAKEN EDITED AND DELETED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THEY LOOK JUST RIGHT THEY'LL SPEND HOURS GAMING WITH FRIENDS CHATTING WITH FAMILY GETTING LOST IN FUNNY VIDEOS OR STREAMING EPISODES OF THEIR FAVORITE SHOWS THOSE THE THE LATEST NEWS STORIES THROUGH THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS THEY ACCESS SCHOOL ITSELF THROUGH AN EDUCATIONAL PORTAL PORTAL SUCH AS GOOGLE CLASSROOM AND REGULARLY USE SEARCH ENGINES OR YOUTUBE FOR HOMEWORK RESEARCH OR HOW TO VIDEOS THE IMAGES THEY SEE WILL BE HEAVILY CURATED MANY WILL MAKE THEM SMILE AND LAUGH BUT JUST AS MANY WILL MAKE THEM FEEL ENVIOUS AND INSECURE DON'T WONDER WHY THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT OR WHAT FILTERS WERE USED AS THEY SCROLL THE CONTENT ALL STARTS TO LOOK THE SAME BUT THEY CAN'T PULL AWAY MISINFORMATION IS EVERYWHERE SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT AND HATE SPEECH IS COMMON THEY'LL SEE DISTURBING IMAGES ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT NOT REPORT THEM TO THE PLATFORM SINCE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL DO MUCH GOOD THEY WON'T TALK TO THEIR PARENTS OR GUARDIANS ABOUT THE DISTURBING THINGS THEY SAW MAYBE OUT OF EMBARRASSMENT OR FEAR THAT THEIR PARENTS WILL IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ACCESS AND THEY WILL BE BOMBARDED WITH TARGETED ADS THAT SEEM TO FOLLOW THEM WHEREVER THEY GO HE'S YOUNG PEOPLE TURNED TO SOCIAL MEDIA FOR CONNECTION CREATIVITY INFORMATION CURIOSITY AND FUN BUT THEY'RE HAVING TO WORK HARDER AND HARDER TO FILTER OUT THE BAD IN SEARCH OF THE GOOD AND THEY'RE MOSTLY HAVING TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE ONLINE WORLD ON THEIR OWN IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE I'VE BEEN TROUBLED BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEIR PERCEIVED VALUE ON SOCIAL MEDIA SEEMS TO BE HUSING THAT THEIR EMERGING IDENTITY NUMBERS OF LIKES FOLLOWS COMMENTS AND SHARES HAVE BECOME A SKEWED CURRENCY OF ADOLESCENTS LIVING UP TO SOCIAL MEDIA'S EXPECTATIONS HAS CREATED A POWERLESSNESS THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE COME TO ACCEPT SEEING OF SOCIALLY VIABLE ALTERNATIVES IN OTHER WORDS THE STEEP COST OF BEING A TEENAGER TODAY WHY DO WE ALLOW THIS TO BE THE NORM FOR OUR YOUNGEST AND MOST IMPRESSIONABLE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY INSTEAD WHY AREN'T PLATFORMS COMPETING TO BUILD PRODUCTS THAT MOST EMPOWER SUPPORT AND INSPIRE OUR YOUTH STILL ALLOWING FOR INNOVATION BUT MOVING AWAY FROM THE CURRENT AD BASED REVENUE MODEL TO ONE WHERE REWARDS FOLLOW QUALITY AND AUTHENTICITY OF CONTENT PROMOTING CONNECTION AND PURE SELF EXPRESSION RATHER THAN CURATED FEEDS LIKES CLICKS AND VIEWS IMAGINE THE EFFECT SUCH A VIBRANT SPACES COULD HAVE ON OUR COLLECTIVE MENTAL HEALTH IN ORDER TO TRULY CONSIDER THE BEST INTERESTS OF YOUTH ONLINE THEY NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCTS INTENDED TO SERVE THEM MANY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SOCIAL AND MEDIA ENVIRONMENT CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AND THEY WANT MORE SUPPORT FROM PARENTS MENTORS AND POLICY MAKERS TO PROTECT THEIR WELL BEING SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HEAR FROM A FEW OF THEM TODAY AND VIA VIDEO I'VE BROUGHT WITH ME THE VOICES OF SEVERAL YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH ON OUR GOOD FOR MEDIA PROJECT IT'S A PEER MENTORING PROGRAM WHERE YOUTH SHARE THEIR HARD EARNED WISDOM WITH YOUNGER TEENS AND TWEENS TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE A MORE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE PROJECT CHALLENGES THEM TO REFLECT ON QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR YOUNGER SELF BEFORE GETTING YOUR FIRST PHONE WHAT STRATEGIES DO YOU USE ONLINE TO PROTECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND RELEVANT TODAY IF YOU COULD ADVISE POLICY MAKERS WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CHANGE HERE'S WHAT SOME OF THEM HAD TO SAY BUYS LAWMAKERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA APPS TO CHANGE ONE THING I'D ASK THEM TO EVOLVE THEIR TECHNOLOGY TO BEING MORE WELL ROUNDED FOR EXAMPLE SERVING MORE POINTS OF VIEWS -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE TIME PEOPLE FALL UNDER RABBIT HOLES OF SEEING THE SAME PERSPECTIVES AND SAME POSTS AND THINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT MICROTARGETING OF CONTENT REALLY AFFECTS YOUR SELF PERCEPTIONS AND PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF TIME THIS LEADS TO FORCED IDEAS AND THOUGHTS AND I THINK THAT THE LACK OF THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES CAUSES PEOPLE TO COMPARE THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THESE IDEALIZED VERSIONS OF WHAT THEY SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND I THINK THAT WHEN PEOPLE BECOME CAUGHT UP IN THIS FALSE NARRATIVE THEY GET OVERWHELMED AND THIS CAUSES MENTAL ANXIETY AND CAN LEAD TO POOR MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE TO ADVISE LAW OR POLICY MAKERS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA I THINK I WOULD DEFINITELY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF USERS ARE TWEENS UNDER OR AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN WHICH IS THE LIMIT OF WHEN YOU CAN START DRAWING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND WHILE THIS IS KIND OF STATE IT AS THE NORM IT'S NOT REALLY ENFORCED AND SO -- I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF CONTENT -- CAN EASILY BE TO MATURE I'M JUST FOR THAT AGE AWAY FOR USED TO BE ABLE TO TURN OFF AND BLOCK AND REPORT CONTENT THAT'S NOT AS QUITE AGE APPROPRIATE FOR THEM OR -- JUST A BETTER WAY TO REGULATE YOU KNOW ON THE AGES OF THESE USED FOR MYSELF SOMETIMES MAKE PEOPLE MAKE ME FEEL INSPIRED OR CREATIVE BUT AT OTHER TIMES IT CAN MAKE ME FEEL REALLY JEALOUS OR INSECURE ABOUT MYSELF AND WHEN I'M EXPERIENCING THOSE SORT OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA THAT'S WHEN I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO ADJUST MY FEET SO THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYTHING IF I WERE TO GIVE STATE POLICYMAKERS AND ADULT ALISON VICE BUT HOW TO MAKE SOCIAL MEDIA A BETTER SAFER AND HEALTHIER PLEASE PLEASE I THINK I WOULD SUM IT UP WITH THE PHRASE STOP CENTERING PROFIT INSERTS ENTERING YOU TO CONSUMERS AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT THE COMPANIES WHO MAKE THESE ALGORITHMS TO CREATE THESE APPS THEY DO SO WITH THE PURPOSE OF MAKING MONEY AND TURNING A PROFIT -- AND AS A RESULT WHEN THEY RECOMMEND US CONTENT NEWS INFORMATION AND SO ON IT'S OFTEN WHAT GETS THE MOST ENGAGEMENT -- WHAT'S GOOD IF SOMEONE CLICKS WILL GETS THE MOST LIKES WILL GET THE MOST ABSENCE -- BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN THAT INFORMATION WERE GIVEN OR RECOMMENDED IS CREDIBLE INFORMED WELL SOURCED OR NEEDS ANY STANDARD TO BE CONSIDERED AS ADVISING CALL C. MAKERS ON WHAT TO DO IN REGARDS TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO ENSURE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE DATA THEY'RE COLLECTING FROM YOU AS WELL AS HOW IT'S USED FOR EXAMPLE THEY SHOULD HAVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY AND UNDERSTANDABLE ADDITIONALLY THEY SHOULD HAVE OBVIOUS WAYS THAT YOU CAN PREVENT OR LIMIT DATA COLLECTION IDEALLY THESE DATA COLLECTION LIMITING OPTIONS WOULD BE LOCKED OUT SO THE DATA IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED AT ALL IF I COULD TALK TO POLICYMAKERS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA I WOULD ADVISE THEM TO CHANGE RULES REGARDING HOW SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS CAN IMPLEMENT ALGORITHMS ON KIDS ACCOUNTS OTHER THAN THIS MAKE IT SO THAT SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BECOME A HUGE TIME SUCK FOR KIDS WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE TOOLS OR GUIDANCE TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE SOCIAL MEDIA AND SAFE AND HEALTHY WAY I'LL MAKE IT EASY FOR KIDS TO BECOME CONSUMED BY SOCIAL MEDIA I THINK I COULD HAVE THE OPTION TO TURN OFF THE ALGORITHM THAT PROVIDES THEM WITH PERSONALIZED CONTENT SO THEY CAN SET BOUNDARIES AND TAKE BACK CONTROL WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA THANK YOU YOU'LL NOTICE NONE OF THESE REMARKABLE YOUNG LEADERS SAID THAT THEY WANT TO ELIMINATE SOCIAL MEDIA FROM THEIR LIVES THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER AND THEY HAVE GREAT IDEAS LISTENING TO THEIR STATEMENTS WE HEAR THESE CONSISTENT TEAMS MORE CONTROL PERSONAL CHOICE AGENCY TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY READ SEE AND INTERACT WITH ONLINE NOT HAVING THEIR EXPERIENCE MANIPULATED BASED ON SOMEONE ELSE'S IDEA OF WHAT THEY THINK THEY SHOULD OR WANT TO SEE HELPING THEM TO BE MORE CRITICAL AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT CONTENT THEY'RE INGESTING AND WHAT IMPACT IT HAS ON THEIR MOOD OR THEIR FEELINGS HELP UNDERSTANDING HOW THEIR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING USED AND GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF SUCH USE A DISS I DESIRE FOR DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVES AND CONTENT PEOPLE BEING REAL AUTHENTIC NOT PERFORMATIVE PERFECTED VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO RELATE TO OR LIVE UP TO CONSIDERATION FOR THE ENORMOUS AGE SPAN OF PEOPLE MIXING WITH AN ONLINE SPACES AND DOING A BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING THOSE WHO ARE YOUNGER AND DON'T YET HAVE THE SKILLS OR LIFE EXPERIENCE TO MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES OR MINIMIZE HARMS WE SIT AT AN INFLECTION POINT WHERE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE NEXT GENERATION RELIES ON ADOPTION OF A NEW DESIGN PARADIGM THAT PLACES A PREMIUM ON A WELLBEING SAFETY AND PRIVACY ABOVE OTHER INTERESTS YET STILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE INNOVATION AND COMPETITION WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK BEYOND THE QUESTION OF HOW IS SOCIAL MEDIA HARMING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO INSTEAD ASK HOW ARE WE DEFINING AND SUSTAINING A SOCIAL MEDIA ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND CREATIVITY OF OUR NEXT GENERATION TO ESTABLISH A NEW SET OF EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS THE PRIORITIZE THE WELL BEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO CREATE A SAFE HEALTHY SPACES THEY ARE ASKING FOR AND DESERVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS HARRIS AND APPRECIATE THAT -- WE'RE NOW GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM DR JENNY RADESKY WHO HAS A DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICIAN AND ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN MEDICAL SCHOOL -- HER RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN MOBILE TECHNOLOGY PARENTING PARENT CHILD INTERACTION AND THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT OF PROCESSES SUCH AS SELF REGULATION AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING DOCTOR TESKE WELCOME IF I CAN INVITE YOU TO MOVE YOUR MICROPHONE CLOSE YOURSELF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU INCLUDING OUR GOOD FRIEND CHRIS AND KELLY WHO'S SITTING IN THE BACK SO THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH -- THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY BUT THE CHAIRS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION YES I AM A DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICIAN -- I MY N. H. FUNDED RESEARCH FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS -- MODERN DIGITAL MEDIA PARENTING AND CHILDREN'S SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT MY TESTIMONY TODAY -- REPRESENTS MY EXPERTISE IS A PEDIATRICIAN AND RESEARCHER -- NOT THE VIEWS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SO WITH TODAY'S TESTIMONY I HOPE TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THE DEVELOPMENTAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN SO BIRTH TO FIVE YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CONSIDERED IN THE DESIGN OF THE CURRENT DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY CALIFORNIA HAS FOR IMPROVING EARLY CHILDHOOD AND ALL CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH ON A POPULATION SCALE BY MAKING CHILD CENTERED DIGITAL DESIGN THE NORM SO I KNOW THAT THE TOPIC OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND DIGITAL MEDIA CAN BE CONTENTIOUS I WAS THE LEAD AUTHOR OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS MEDIA GUIDELINES OFTEN KNOWN AS THE SCREEN TIME GUIDELINES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN SO I EXPERIENCED HOW THE PUBLIC OFTEN RESPONSE TO THIS TOPIC WITH PANICKED AND POLARIZED DEBATES HOWEVER CARING ABOUT CHILDREN'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH DIGITAL MEDIA SHOULDN'T BE A SENTIMENTAL OR EMOTIONAL ISSUE IT'S HIGHLY PRACTICAL AND IT'S GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH IN MEDICINE WE'VE REALIZED THE IMMENSE POWER OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THE STRUCTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT SHAPE PATIENTS OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS TOM FRIEDEN THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND ESTABLISH THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN MAKE MUCH MORE OF A HEALTH IMPACT BY ADDRESSING THE ENVIRONMENT MAKING PEOPLE'S DEFAULT DECISIONS HEALTHY RATHER THAN TRYING TO INTERVENE PATIENT BY INDIVIDUAL PATIENT SO WE OFTEN THINK OF CHILDREN'S HOUSING ENVIRONMENTS IN THEIR FOOD ENVIRONMENTS BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE THINKING UP THEIR DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS NOT JUST EVERYTHING ON AN INDIVIDUAL SCALE BECAUSE DIGITAL MEDIA ARE SOME OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL AND UBIQUITOUS EXPOSURES THAT CHILDREN EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY BASIS AND ARE OFTEN DESIGNED BY ADULTS UNTRAINED IN THE CURIOUS AND EXPANSIVE WAYS THAT CHILDREN EXPERIENCE THE WORLD SO CONSEQUENTLY DIGITAL DESIGN OFTEN FOCUSES ON MONETIZATION OR ENGAGEMENT METRICS AND MAY NOT CONSIDER THE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON CHILD USERS HOWEVER THIS ALSO MEANS THAT UPDATING THIS RELATIVELY NASCENT DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM TO BE MORE CHILD CENTERED MAY HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON CHILD WELL BEING THAN ASKING EACH INDIVIDUAL FAMILY TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIORS SO THEREFORE I BUILT MY RESEARCH PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AROUND FOCUSING ON MISMATCHES BETWEEN HOW THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT IS DESIGNED AND CHILDREN'S UNIQUE DEVELOPMENTAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS SOMETHING TO REVIEW A FEW OF THOSE EXAMPLES TODAY SO FIRST EARLY CHARACTER BROOCH CAREGIVER CHILD RELATIONSHIPS ARE THE BEDROCK OF LIFELONG MENTAL HEALTH IT ARE FREQUENTLY INTERRUPTED AND DISPLACED BY TECHNOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS THAT ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO POST AND REACT AND CONSUME AND LESS AMOUNTS OF CONTENT OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN PARENTS ATTENTION AS HEAVILY ABSORBED IN THEIR MOBILE DEVICES THERE'S LESS VERBAL AND NONVERBAL INTERACTION WITH YOUNG CHILDREN LESS INSIGHT INTO THE MEANING OF CHILD BEHAVIOR AND OVER TIME A WORSENING OF CHILD BEHAVIOR OTHER RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THESE INTERRUPTIONS REDUCE CHILDREN'S LEARNING FROM THEIR PARENTS AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR PARENTS TO KNOW HOW TO REPAIR WITH THEIR CHILDREN AFTER A TOUGH MOMENT SO THIS POINT IS IMPORTANT WE DON'T NEED TO BE PERFECT PARENTS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RESPONSIVE TO ALL OUR CHILDREN ALL DAY LONG BUT DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE SHOWS THAT WHEN CHILDREN AND PARENTS CAN REPAIR AFTER DIFFICULT MOMENTS THIS LEADS TO SECURE ATTACHMENT AND THIS MEANS A STRONGER SENSE OF SELF AND EMOTION REGULATION FOR THE CHILD AND THE MISMATCH HERE IS THAT SILICON VALLEY'S DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS EMPHASIZE PERSONALIZATION FOR A SINGLE USER BUT THIS IS AT ODDS WITH HOW CHILDREN EXPERIENCE THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR FIRST RELATIONSHIPS IT ALSO IGNORES HOW HARD PARENTS ARE WORKING RIGHT NOW TO BE RESPONSIVE TO CHILD CUES AND BEHAVIORS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING IN THERE TO ON IN THEIR CHILDREN'S MINDS WHILE THEIR ATTENTION IS PULLED IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SO INSTEAD OF BLAMING PARENTS ABOUT USING THEIR DEVICES IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN MY RESEARCH HAS ASKED WHY THEY DO THIS AND PARENTS TELL US THAT DEVICES HAVE A HAWK THEY ARE COGNITIVELY AND EMOTIONALLY OVERLOADED FROM THE DEVICES IN THEIR LAPS OR THEIR POCKETS AND THEY SAY THAT SOCIAL MEDIA AS A SOURCE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT BUT ALSO A LOT OF TOXIC CONTENT THAT THEY NEED TO WADE THROUGH SO VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ADOLESCENTS HAVE SAID IN THOSE VIDEOS THEY WANT THE SAME SORT OF CONTROL AN AGENCY OVER THEIR FEEDS AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE TO DISCUSS PARENTS MEDIA USE BUT I THINK THIS POINT ILLUSTRATES HOW DIGITAL DESIGN HAS LARGELY IGNORED HER CHILDREN'S EXPERIENCES ARE INSEPARABLE FROM THEIR RELATIONAL CONTEXTS SO SECOND IN EARLY CHILDHOOD LEARNING HOW TO IDENTIFY AND MANAGE EMOTIONS IS ANOTHER FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH BUT YOU BAKER JUST DESIGN AND FRICTIONLESS ACCESS TO MYRIAD CONTENT MEANS THAT CHILDREN CAN POTENTIALLY USE GAMES AND VIDEOS AT ANY TIME OF DAY OR ANY MOMENT OF BOREDOM THE DIFFICULT THING ABOUT RAISING YOUNG CHILDREN IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY FULL OF A LOT OF FRICTION A LOT OF NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS AND PARENT SELF DOUBT AS CHILDREN LEARN HOW TO INHIBIT THEIR IMPULSES IDENTIFY HOW THEIR BRAIN AND BODY YOU'RE FEELING AND HOW TO MANAGE THAT FRUSTRATION THIS IS ONE CRITICAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING SKILLS ARE DEVELOPING WHICH HAPPENED TO PLAY AND SENSITIVE INTERACTIONS WITH CAREGIVERS AND CHILDREN BEING GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO EXPLORE AND FAIL AND REPAIR WITHOUT TECHNOLOGIES DEMANDING THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION OUR RESEARCH STUDYING THE TOP APPS LABELED AS EDUCATIONAL SHOWS THAT THE MAJORITY ACTUALLY PROVIDE LOW QUALITY SIMPLISTIC AND REPETITIVE GAMEPLAY AND ARE FULL OF DISTRACTIONS SUCH AS ADS OR VIRTUAL REWARDS WHAT ALSO CONCERNS EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIALISES HOW DEPENDENT SOME CHILDREN HAVE BECOME ON USING MEDIA AS A COMMON TOOL PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DELAYS MY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT EXCESSIVE USE OF MEDIA FOR CALMING IS LINKED WITH MORE EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY OVER TIME A SIGN THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT LEARNING THEIR OWN INTERNAL MECHANISMS OF MANAGING STRONG EMOTIONS AND RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THIS MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO PROBLEMATIC MEDIA USE HABITS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD SUCH AS RELYING ON MEDIA FOR COPING THAT WE THINK MAY CARRY FORWARD INTO THE TWEEN AND TEEN YEARS AND THIS WOULD NOT BE IS CONCERNING OF CHILDREN WERE REGULARLY ACCESSING POSITIVE PROGRAMS LIKE DANIEL TIGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD OR SESAME STREET EVERY TIME THEY PICKED UP THEIR MOBILE DEVICE BUT OUR RESEARCH TRACKING CHILDREN'S TABLETS AND SMARTPHONES SHOWS THAT THE FRICTIONLESS APP STORES HAVE PROVIDED ACCESS TO A WIDE RANGE OF AGE INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT WHEN REVIEWING THE APPS THAT THREE TO FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN IN OUR STUDIES HAVE USED WE HAVE FOUND APPS WITH NAMES LIKE TERRORIST SHOOTER THREE D. FLIPPY KNIFE KICK THE BUDDY HEAD AND HORROR APPS LIKE GRANNY SO EVEN WHEN CHILDREN ARE PLAYING AGE AN APPROACH AGE APPROPRIATE GAMES ADDS THAT COME THROUGH AD NETWORKS CAN HAVE VIOLENT OR INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT APPLE MARKET PLACES AN AD NETWORKS CONTINUE TO BE A PART OF THE DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM THAT HAVE NOT FULLY GRASP CHILDREN'S NEEDS DESPITE BEING A FREQUENT ENTRY POINT FOR CHILDREN'S ONLINE EXPERIENCES SO THIS LEADS ME TO MY THIRD MISMATCH WHICH IS HOW HEAVILY MONETIZED CHILDREN'S DIGITAL SPACES ARE DESPITE CHILDREN NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTS LIKE ADVERTISING OR THE VALUE OF CURRENCY OR PERSUASIVE NUDGES SO BY TRACKING YOUNG CHILDREN'S MOBILE DEVICES MY RESEARCH TEAM REALIZE HOW MUCH TIME CHILDREN ARE SPENDING ON PLATFORMS NOT INITIALLY DESIGNED WITH CHILDREN IN MIND SUCH AS YOU TO TO ANALYZE CHILDREN'S YOUTUBE VIEWING HISTORIES FINDING THEM THAT THE MAJORITY OF VIDEOS YOUNG CHILDREN ARE WATCHING ARE NOT EDUCATIONAL ARE HIGHLY COMMERCIALIZED AND MANY CONTAIN VIOLENT OR STEREO TYPES CONTENT ON SOME CHANNELS WE EXAMINED DURATION OF ADS EXCEEDED THE DURATION OF THE VIDEOS SO ALTHOUGH POSITIVE CONTENT EXISTS ON LIKE ON YOUTUBE LIKE CROCHETING CHILDREN APPEAR TO BE WATCHING WHAT TRENDS AND ALGORITHMS THAT ELEVATE THE JUNK UNFORTUNATELY LEAD TO CONTENT CREATORS TRYING TO PRODUCE MORE OUTRAGEOUS CONTENT TO GET MORE CLICKS AND ENGAGEMENT IN MOBILE APPS MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON WHERE DIGITAL DESIGN IS CROSSING THE LINE IN TERMS OF MANIPULATING CHILDREN ALSO KNOWN AS DARK PATTERNS INTO WATCHING MORE ADS PLAYING FOR LONGER MAKING MORE PURCHASES IN OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY APPS THAT WE DOWNLOADED PLAYED EIGHTY PERCENT CONTAINED AT LEAST ONE TYPE OF MANIPULATIVE DARK PATTERN THIS COMES IN THE FORM OF PRESSURE FROM TRUSTED CHARACTERS NAVIGATION CONSTRAINTS THAT MAKE KIDS KEEP PLAYING FABRICATED TIME PRESSURE PROMISES OF VIRTUAL CURRENCIES ARE GAME PLAY OBJECTS OR REWARDS FOR WATCHING ADS WE'RE FINDING THAT ADULTS DESIGN NORMS ARE JUST COPIED AND PASTED SLOPPILY INTO CHILDREN'S DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOOD DESIGN IN ADDITION WE FOUND THAT CHILDREN FROM LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PLAY APPS WITH MANIPULATIVE DARK PATTERNS THEY'RE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO WATCH YOUTUBE AND MUCH OF FOR LONGER WHICH SUGGESTS THE CHILDREN'S DIGITAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE BEING SHAPED BY WHAT IS EASILY AVAILABLE AND WHAT IS FREE THE DEFAULT CONDITIONS THE DOCTOR FRIEDMAN HAS TALKED ABOUT ALTHOUGH MY LAB IS DOCUMENTED THE PREDOMINANCE OF INAPPROPRIATE DESIGN FEATURES AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE FOUND MANY CHILD CENTERED -- INDUSTRIES THAT STAND OUT AND IT'S A RELIEF ON MY RESEARCH ASSISTANTS PLAY SOMETHING LIKE PBS KIDS OR KHAN ACADEMY -- TOCA BOCA OR LET GO BECAUSE THEY DON'T COLLECT DATA THAT THEY DON'T SERVE ADS THEY HAVE MEANINGFUL CONTENT THEY HAVE STOPPAGE CUES TO LET KIDS DISENGAGE AND GO NUDGED THEM TO PLAY IN THE THREE D. PHYSICAL OR SOCIAL WORLDS THEY GIVE KIDS THE AGENCY AND AUTONOMY TO CHOOSE WHAT TO DO NEXT AND THEY REGULARLY EVALUATE THEIR PRODUCTS TO EACH QUESTION ALL THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY MADE AT THE DESIGN OUTSET WE NEED MORE COMPANIES THAT SHOW A DUTY OF CARE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY INHERENT IN CREATING THE IMAGES AND STORIES THAT CHILDREN CONSUME I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT REGULATION THROUGH THE AGE APPROPRIATE DESIGN CODE IN THE U. K. DID NOT KILL THE TECH INDUSTRY BUT ACTUALLY ALLOWED A LOT OF CHILD CENTERED IDEAS THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE PLANNING STAGES WITH CHILD TEAMS AT GOOGLE OR MATTER OR OTHER LARGE COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY COME TO FRUITION AND FINALLY BE PRIORITIZED IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE WHEN THE ADC WENT INTO EFFECT INSTAGRAM FINALLY MADE TEENS ACCOUNTS PRIVATE BY DEFAULT YOUTUBE FINALLY MADE NIGHT TIME NOTIFICATIONS OFF BY DEFAULT THESE ARE BASIC IMPROVEMENTS THAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED YEARS AGO BUT THERE CLEAR SIGNS THAT THESE CHANGES ARE FEASIBLE AND THERE'S STILL SO MANY OTHER INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT INDUSTRY CAN DESIGN FOR KIDS AND STILL MAKE PROFITS AND SUMMARY I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY NASCENT INDUSTRY CREATING A RAPIDLY CHANGING DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT AND THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO DEBUG WHAT HAS BEEN HASTILY CREATED AND REDESIGN IT IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM BOTH YOUR NOW WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND OPEN IT UP TO FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS GARCIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SO WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE CHILD CENTERED SITES LIKE PBS KIDS THE KHAN ACADEMY AND I'VE I HAVE VISITED THOSE SITES AND A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO THAT ARE CHILD CENTERED -- BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT PEPPERMINT DIRECTIONAL LIKE OUR KIDS ARE IN TECH TALKS BASED FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM -- DISCORD I JUST RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT WE ARE IN SO WHAT WOULD BE FROM CHILD CENTERED -- IDEAS THAT THESE OTHER PLATFORMS CAN BE USING SO I THINK FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NOT A SOCIAL COMPONENT TO A LOT OF THOSE APPS THEY'RE REALLY MEANT TO JUST ENGAGE THE USER AND MAYBE THAT THE CHILD'S PARENTS -- IF YOU WERE ADDING A SOCIAL COMPONENT I THINK THERE NEED TO BE DESIGNED FROM THE GROUND UP ENGAGING FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN NOT JUST RETROFITTING EXISTING APPS LIKE TICK TOCK OR DOING OTHER THINGS THAT JUST CREATE YOU KNOW FILTERS OR NEW PRIVACY SETTINGS I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT CHILD CENTERED DESIGN IS YOU'RE REALLY WORKING WITH FAMILIES SEEING HOW CHILDREN EXPERIENCE THESE PRODUCTS TESTING THEM OUT AND THEN CONTINUING TO DO ONGOING AUDITS ARE TESTING TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE USING THEM IN THE WAYS YOU ANTICIPATED THERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES SAY LIKE LEGO HAS LIKE A LIFE WHICH IS A SOCIAL PLATFORM FOR KIDS WHERE THEY JUST DON'T SHOW THEIR FACES THEY DON'T USE THEIR REAL NAMES BUT THEY CAN SHARE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN TERMS OF LIKE COMMENTS -- YOU KNOW AND THERE'S CERTAIN PROTECTIONS JUST SO THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY COMMENTING IN NEGATIVE WAYS BUT IT'S MORE AGE APPROPRIATE IN THAT KIDS DON'T NEED THEIR IMAGE -- TO BE THE CENTER OF THE ATTENTION HERE THEIR CREATIVITY SHOULD BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION AND I THINK THAT EACH PRODUCT WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO THINK THAT WAY OF HOW DO WE UP LEFT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CHILDREN RIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IT BEING ABOUT WHAT A LOT OF THE SOCIAL PLATFORMS ARE ABOUT WITCHES APPEARANCE OR PERFORMANCE OR YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF METRICS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE APPROVED OF WHAT YOU JUST DID YOU KNOW MANY OF THESE THESE SATIN PLATFORMS MAY NOT HAVE LAKES OR OTHER METRICS OF ENGAGEMENT AT ALL SO SHOULD WE BE RAISING THE AGE LIMIT FOR THE SOCIAL PLATFORMS RIGHT NOW SOME OF THEM HAVE AT THIRTEEN -- I APPRECIATE THIS OR VETS -- COMMENT ABOUT HER KIDS NOT BEING ON THE PLATFORM -- AND AND VISUALLY BE RAISING THAT AGE LIMIT THEN THE SORT OF RECOMMENDATION YEAH I MEAN I WOULD ANSWER THAT BY LIKE CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW IT'S SORT OF ALL OR NOTHING LIKE IT'S EITHER YOUR HONOR YOUR OFF AND THERE'S ONLY ONE ONLINE WORLD THAT THAT'S FOR ADULTS FOR KIDS FOR EVERYBODY SO I THINK CREATING SPACES THAT ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SO THAT IT CAN BE A SAFE AREA FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO PLAY AND SOCIALIZE AN EXPERIMENT I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND BECAUSE -- THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN THE OFFLINE WORLD RIGHT WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE ENGAGING IN SAFER ENVIRONMENTS AND WE DON'T JUST THROW THEM IN WITH EVERYBODY -- SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS DOING SOME MORE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SPACES SO THEY HAVE MORE CHOICES YEAH I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF A COMBINATION OF ADJUSTING THE EXISTING SPACES THAT TEENAGERS ARE USING THERE'S A STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT YESTERDAY IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS TELLING THAT THERE ARE THESE DEVELOPMENTALLY SENSITIVE WINDOWS IN THE ADOLESCENT YEARS WHEN GIRLS MIGHT STRUGGLE MORE WITH IT DURING THAT KIND OF ELEVEN TO FOURTEEN AGE RANGE AND BOYS MORE LATER IN ADOLESCENCE SO -- THERE MAY NEED TO BE BOTH -- IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DESIGN OF THE EXISTING PLATFORMS I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE CHILD TEAMS WORKING ON WAYS TO TRY TO MAKE IT A GRADED APPROPRIATE CONTENT RATHER THAN AN ALL OR NOTHING ENTRY INTO YOU KNOW THE ADULT SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD RIGHT AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN WHICH IS -- RIGHT NOW A LOT OF RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT'S MORE THAN CHILDREN ONCE AT THAT AGE AND IT'S MORE THAN IS DEVELOPMENTALLY SAFE OR APPROPRIATE FOR THEM I APPRECIATE -- FRAMING IT IN TERMS OF ADJUSTING WHAT EXISTS THE CREATING OF A PLATFORM THAT IS CHILD CENTRED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING INSIDE I WILL SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT A NEW MINDSET THAT YOU PUT IN MY HEAD MY APPROACH HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON THE ADJUSTMENT OF EXISTING PLATFORMS -- VERSUS HAVING THE DUAL TANDEM FACT THAT YOU JUST SPOKE TO US ABOUT IT IN IN THAT ADJUSTMENT OF OF THIS PART FOR MY HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THE ADOLESCENTS AND THE IMAGES ARE GETTING -- AND HOW IT IS FEEDING THEIR EATING DISORDERS -- ALONG THE WAY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH ALONG THE WAY YOU TO THOSE IMAGES OF IT S. AS THE STARTING POINT OF FLOOR FOR ADJUSTING THOSE PREFERENCE AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S YOUR APPROPRIATE POLICY AND I DON'T KNOW BUT TRYING TO FIND WAYS -- AND SO WHAT ARE SOME AMERICAN RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE INSURANCE OF THE ADJUSTMENT SIDE OF EXISTING SOCIAL PLATFORMS HEAR FROM A TECHNOLOGIST LATER THAT WOULD HAVE MORE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I THINK PART OF WHAT WHAT IT SPEAKS TO IS JUST THE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE DRIVING CONTENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IF A YOUNG PERSON WHO'S CURIOUS AND YOU KNOW EXPLORING STUMBLES UPON TROUBLING CONTENT AND INTERVIEWS THAT THE ALGORITHMS GONNA THINK THEY WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT -- SO THAT SOMETIMES HOW THEY GET TRAPPED INTO THESE LOOPS OF CONTENT THAT IS NOT HEALTHY -- AND SO IF THERE'S MORE CONTROL OVER YOU KNOW GOING WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND SEEING THINGS YOU WANT TO SEE NOT WHAT'S BEING FOR STATUTES THAT THAT IS GOING TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE TROUBLING CONTENT THAT'S THAT THEY'RE BEING EXPOSED TO AND I CAN GIVE AN EXAMPLE FROM EXAMINING THAT -- THE THUMBNAILS THAT ARE OFFERED TO CHILDREN AT THE END OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS TO LOOK AT WHAT IS RECOMMENDED TO THE NEXT AND A LOT OF THOSE IMAGES CONTAIN A LOT OF EITHER VIOLENCE OR MANUFACTURED DRAMA OR A LOT OF JUST VISUAL OUTRAGEOUS NOUS -- SOME OF IT SEXUALIZED SOME OF IT MORE -- IT JUST LAVISH AND FULL OF MONEY AND AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS JUST REALLY TRYING TO LURE CHILDREN TO CLICK THROUGH AND SO CONTENT CREATORS ARE DOING THAT BECAUSE THE ALGORITHM HAS INCENTIVIZE THE MORE CLICKS IN THE MORE ENGAGEMENT YOU GET THE MORE AD REVENUE YOU'RE GOING TO GET SO IF THEY COULD CHANGE SOME OF THE INCENTIVES AROUND PROFITS ON THESE SITES IF THEY COULD CHANGE THE WAY SOME OF THE -- SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT TO CLICK THROUGH NEXT BECAUSE WHEN I'VE OPENED UP SNAPCHAT OR OTHER THINGS I SEE PLENTY OF FEMALE AND MALE AND OTHER BODIES IN KERR IT AS PART OF THAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO TO CLICK THROUGH AND SO IT'S BECOME PART OF THE ENGAGEMENT JURISTIC SAYS THAT THAT -- CONTENT CREATORS ARE USING TO GET MORE ENGAGEMENT AND THAT MAY BE WHY IT'S JUST BECOME SO COMMON OUT FOR TEENS TO BE GOING DOWN THOSE RABBIT HOLES AND THEN FINALLY -- IF THERE'S A WAY TO CHANGE THE ALGORITHM TO ACTUALLY -- GET IT TO ELEVATE MORE POSITIVE CONTENT CONTENT THAT PERHAPS HAS BEEN REVIEWED BY HUMANS AND KIND OF THAT THERE ARE IS SOME AGREEMENT AND DEVELOPMENTAL CONSENSUS LIKE YES THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF THAT WE WOULD WANT KIDS OF CERTAIN AGES TO BE SEEING IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC OF THAT SORT OF ELEVATION COULD BE HAPPENING RATHER THAN THE ELEVATION OF WHAT'S REALLY CLICK BAITY THANK YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS IT'S A SAYS HE RISK GIVING YOUR LAST COMMENTS I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY AND AND HOW THEY HAVE AT TIMES USE HAPTICS TO GET -- FOLKS HOOKED AT AN EARLY AGE AND CREATE A LIFETIME YOU SIR OF BAD HABITS AND SO SOUNDS A LOT LIKE PRESCRIBING THE VERY SIMILAR TYPE OF TACTICS WITH OUR CURRENT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OUT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMAN I KNOW THAT -- CHAIRMAN FOR HER THAT HAD SOME QUESTIONS S. THANK YOU AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED IN MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS -- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE PLATFORMS ARE DOING RIGHT THERE THEY'RE NOT NONPROFITS THEY'RE NOT THEIR JOB IS NOT TO LOOK OUT FOR A CUP PUBLIC GOOD THEY'RE OFFERED A JOB IS TO OFFER A PLATFORM AND OUR THINK OUR JOB IS GOVERNMENT IS HOW DO WE PROPERLY REGULATE THAT FOR KIDS YOU KNOW I'M USED TO WORK REGULATE SORRY GUYS -- BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THE U. S. IS SAID YOU KNOW THEY WANT THE OPTION TO TURN OFF THE ALGORITHM AND THEN YOU ARE TALKING DR IT'S WEIRD IT'S K. ABOUT YOU KNOW ARE THEY EVEN ABLE TO DISCIPLINE THEMSELVES HOW MANY KIDS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO DISCIPLINE THEMSELVES TO DO SO AND SO I DON'T KNOW FROM YOUR RESEARCH IF YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION FOR US FOR US ABOUT WHAT AT WHAT AGE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE CURRENT RULES OF THE PLATFORM I GIVE YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT ROLE AS A PLATFORM WITH THE ALGORITHMS HOW IT DOES -- CONTENT AND THESE MICROTARGETING I MEAN THAT'S LIKE A MARKETING THING RIGHT LIKE MOST PEOPLE WHO DIE MARKEN COMMUNICATIONS AND SAY THEY DO THIS THEY THEY CLICKED ON THIS THREE TIMES DAILY SEARCH FOR THIS PAGE ALL THAT STUFF AT WHAT AGE CAN YOU SELF REGULATE TO MAKE THOSE WELL INFORMED DECISIONS REGARDLESS OF THEIR SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND I THINK ADULTS STILL STRUGGLE WITH THAT SORT OF SELF REGULATION AND AND A LOT OF MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON PARENTS OWN MEDIA USE AND SO IN OUR LATEST STUDY WE'VE BEEN ASKING PARENTS ARE WHAT ARE THE DIGITAL DESIGN HELPFUL TO YOU IN SUPPORT OF AND THEY MENTIONED THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WALMART AND TARGET APPS THERE SO CONVENIENCE THEY HELPED ME GET THROUGH SHOPPING AND I CAN THEN GO ON AND LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE AS A PARENT AND THEN WHEN WE ASKED ABOUT WHAT SORT OF DESIGN FEATURES ARE UNHELPFUL THEY THEY'VE UNIFORMLY TALKED ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA SITES OFTEN FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM ABOUT HOW THEY GO INTO THOSE PLATFORMS HOPING FOR SOME TYPE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT SEEING THEIR FAMILY HAVING A LAUGH OR AN ESCAPE FINDING NEWS ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY BUT THAT THEY'RE WAITING THROUGH LOTS OF OTHER EITHER TARGETED ADS THAT THEY FIND CREEPY AND SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PARENTS THAT WE INTERVIEWED SAID THEY DID NOT THINK THAT IT WAS ETHICAL TO HAVE REALLY TARGETED ADVERTISING OUT THEM -- AND THEN THEY WANTED MORE CONTROL ONE PARENT SAID I JUST WANT FACEBOOK LITE I WANT THAT VERSION OF IT WHERE I CAN JUST YOU KNOW DO YOU SEE THE FAMILY THAT I WANT TO SEE AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL THE OTHER EITHER POLITICAL STUFF OR MARKETING STAFF OR OR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GETTING XCELERATED BY THE DESIGN FEATURES SO -- THAT IS NOT A SPECIFIC AGE BUT IT IS AN INDICATION THAT I THINK ADULTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE CONTROL AND MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM A LOT OF THESE AD TECH PLATFORMS AS WELL AND THE OTHER THING WHAT WHEN WE ARE HAVING THIS PANEL THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT I WAS BORN IN THE SEVENTIES AND A LOT OF THINGS WE'RE DEALING WITH IS JUST ARE JUST AMPLIFIED TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM RIGHT WHERE MARIE CLAIRE AND COSMETOLOGISTS HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AS WOMEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MAN HAD THAT THAT'S WHAT I HAD AND YOU KNOW SO A LOT OF THAT BODY DYSMORPHIA THAT WE HAVE THE WIND PHOTOSHOP PHOTOS WE THOUGHT WE ALL HAD TO LOOK LIKE KATE MOSS AND I CAN TELL YOU I WAS NEVER GONNA LOOK LIKE KATE MOSS YOU KNOW AND SO HOW HOW THE AND THAT'S BEEN AMPLIFIED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE FILTERS NOW AND AND HOW PEOPLE REALLY RELATE TO THAT AND I'M VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE AT THE TIME WHEN WE HAD PRINT MEDIA WHICH IS OUR PRIMARY FOR MEDIA OR TV WHERE HE WE HAD ADS TARGETING KIDS FOR CIGARETTES FOR EXAMPLE SMOKING -- YOU KNOW WE NOW HAVE IT MUCH QUICKER AND MUCH MORE DIFFUSE DECENTRALISED WAY AND YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT -- YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT THE FCC REQUIRED FOR EVERY ANTI OVER EVERY TOBACCO ADD EQUAL AIR TIME FOR ANTI SMOKING ADS RIGHT SO THERE THERE WE HAVE A SYSTEM FROM BACK IN THE DAY BEFORE SOCIAL MEDIA OF WHERE WE THOUGHT WE SAID OKAY THERE'S A PRIVATE MARKET RIGHT THEY HAVE A FOR PROFIT COMPANIES BUT WE HAVE AS A GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR REGULATING THE PUBLIC GOOD SIDE OF THESE PLATFORMS -- SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE CAN THINK ABOUT -- AND THE OTHER THING THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE EATING DISORDERS AMONG GIRLS DURING THE PANDEMIC IN OUT THE PANDEMIC REALLY FORCED A LOT OF PEOPLE ON I KNOW FIRST ALL OF OUR YOUTH ONLINE WHICH WAS GREAT MY SON GOT TO THE PANDEMIC HAS HIM AS FIVE BODIES COULD GAME AND THEY COULD CHAT AS IF THEY WERE IN PERSON SO HE WAS PERFECTLY FINE RIGHT -- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I KNOW OF MANY CASES EVEN IN MY OWN FAMILY WHERE WHERE CROSS OF BECOME ANOREXIC AND PART OF THAT IS THE SOCIAL MEDIA REALLY TARGETING THAT AND I KNOW THE PLOT FROM SAY WE DON'T DO THIS BUT YOU NO WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ESPECIALLY ON THE EATING DISORDER SIDE OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO PROTECT OUR YOUTH -- AND NO NOT IT'S NOT ONLY GIRLS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY INTERAKSYON BUT LARGELY IT'S IT'S OUR OUR YOUNG GIRLS DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS AROUND EATING DISORDERS HOW SOCIAL MEDIA EXACERBATES IT AND WHAT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE DOING YEAH HI THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I THINK ONE THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS JUST THAT THE DESIRE AND YOU HEARD IT FROM SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR JUST MORE DIVERSE CONTENT AND IT'S BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF WHAT DOCTOR TESKE SAID JUST ELEVATING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF QUALITY OF CONTENT BECAUSE SINCE SO MUCH OF WHAT IS BEING REWARDED ONLINE IS YOU KNOW LIKE -- ADS RELATED TO DIETING OR INNOVATING SUITS IT A LOT OF IT IS IT'S VERY VERY MUCH DRIVEN BY THE CERTAIN STANDARDS OF BEAUTY THEY JUST KEEP THE JUST YOU KNOW AS YOU SCROLL YOU'RE JUST SEEING MORE AND MORE MORE OF THAT SO I THINK AND YOUNG PEOPLE THEY JUST THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT AND THEY LIKE THEY'RE FRUSTRATED BY IT THEY WANTED TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS AND AND THEY WANT TO GO ON THERE FOR YOU KNOW TO UP LIFT THEIR MOOD SO I THINK IF IF THERE WAS THE ABILITY FOR MORE DIVERSE AND MORE AUTHENTIC CONTENT TO BE ELEVATED TO HAVE THAT GET MORE WEIGHT -- OTHER THAN JUST THE KIND OF THE CHEAP ADS AND CHEAP -- CLICKBAIT THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE AND THEN THEY WOULD ENGAGE WITH THAT AND THEN THAT WOULD GET REWARDED SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE PART OF IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE SEEING JUST THE CITY OF MONOLITHIC -- WORLD WHEN YOU GO ON A SCROLL AND THAT'S NOT HELPING SOMEONE THAT'S VULNERABLE TO AN EATING DISORDER I THINK THAT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW GROWING UP IN THE EIGHTIES AND GOING INTO A DRUG STORE AND GETTING UP MARIE CLAIRE COSMOPOLITAN THAT YOU WENT AND YOU HAD THE AUTONOMY TO KIND OF CHOOSE FROM WHAT WAS OFFERED TO YOU ON THE AISLES IT WASN'T FED TO YOU DIRECTLY BASED ON WHAT PRIOR THINGS YOU HAD READ OR EVEN HOVERED OVER AND SO I THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW A COMPARISON SAY TO FOODS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GET RID OF FOOD ENTIRELY AND THERE ARE CERTAIN HEALTHIER FOODS AND OTHER FOODS THAT ARE YOU KNOW JUNK HERE AND WE WANT TO LIMIT YOU DON'T GO INTO A GROCERY STORE AND HAVE AN ALGORITHMICALLY PREDICTIVE YOU KNOW AS A SORT OF DESIGN FEATURE JUST PUTTING THINGS IN YOUR BASKET AND THEN NOT LETTING YOU SEE ALL THE OTHER HEALTHIER FOODS OR THE OTHER MAGAZINE IANS THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE OTHER PARTS OF YOU AS A TEENAGER AND SO I THINK THAT -- ALGORITHMIC TARGETING AND NARROWING IT WHETHER IT HAPPENS BECAUSE THERE WERE REPORTS FROM RESET AUSTRALIA THAT FACEBOOK WAS ALLOWING TARGETING FROM OUTSIDE MARKETERS TWO TEENAGERS BASED ON A TOPIC LIKE EXTREME DIETING OR INTEREST IN DIETING OR FITNESS BUT FACEBOOK ALSO KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT ITS USERS THAT IT COULDN'T IT CAN ELEVATE CONTENT OR IT CAN AT ITSELF TARGET ADVERTISING BASED ON WHAT IT KNOWS IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO OFFER THAT TO A THIRD PARTY ADVERTISER IT CAN DO IT THROUGH ITS OWN MECHANISM SO THE MORE WE CAN LET THERE'D JUST BE MORE OF A BLANK SLATE AND AND LESS OF THIS NARROWING IN TARGETING WHICH CERTAINLY CAN IDENTIFY CHILDREN'S VULNERABILITIES THAT THEY MAY NOT EVEN REALIZE THEY HAVE THEMSELVES IT COULD BE DIETING AND ADDS LOW BODY IMAGE IT COULD BE IMPULSE CONTROL ISSUES THAT COULD BE ANXIETY OR SELF HARM OR YOU KNOW OTHER ISSUES THAT WE WE GEN SEE QUITE A LOT OF RIGHT NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS REMEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA JUMP IN THANK YOU SO I JUST I'M MR ISN'T SOMETHING YOU SENSE WAS THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT YOU WORK WITH HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY -- ARE HESITANT TO REPORT TOXIC CONTENT AND YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I HEAR A LOT FROM FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRIES THAT WE HAVE MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH THAT SINCE I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THAT IS WHY DO THE YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL HESITANT TO DO THAT YEAH THAT WOULD AND THAT WAS SOMETHING WE HEARD FROM THEM AND WE -- ASKED WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY SEE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE AND THEY JUST SAY THEY DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA DO ANY GOOD AND SOME OF THEM HAVE REPORTED AND THEY JUST LIKE IT'S SORT OF TOO LATE AT THAT POINT BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY SEEN THE DISTURBING IMAGE OR WHATEVER IT WAS IT'S NOT GOING TO REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM -- AND SO THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FAITH THAT IT'S GOING TO DO ANYTHING OR IT'S IT'S SORT OF TOO LITTLE TOO LATE THANK YOU THE OTHER -- SORT OF BIGGER QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET A MOVE ON IT'S A LITTLE BIT OUT OF LEFT FIELD BUT I'M CURIOUS TO GET YOUR REACTIONS TO IT IS TWO PEOPLE THAT SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACTS ON YOUNG PEOPLE -- AND THEN PARTICULAR ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS WHAT WHAT THE LONG TERM IMPACTS MIGHT BE RIGHT I THINK WE HAVE SOME RESEARCH ON WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE SHORT TERM -- BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT BE IN THE LONG TERM AND I WAS READING IN THE -- THE ACTUAL BACKGROUND PAPER HERE THAT THAT SCREEN TIME ON RELATED TO SCHOOL MORE THAN DOUBLED FOR AMERICAN TEENAGERS UP TO SEVEN POINT SEVEN HOURS PER DAY SO MAKES ME THANK YOU KNOW WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE SPENDING A THIRD OF THEIR OF THEIR DAY YOU KNOW PROBABLY HALF OF THEIR WAKING TIME IMMERSED ON THESE PLATFORMS AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD AND AND AND MISS GARCIA BROUGHT THIS UP AND AND THAT CHAIR BROUGHT IT UP AND I'VE HEARD FROM OTHER COLLEAGUES ONE ANALOGY WHICH IS THE ANALOGY TO TOBACCO AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL ANALOGY IN SOME WAYS RIGHT YOU'VE GOT A PRODUCT THAT IS POTENTIALLY ADDICTIVE THERE'S INTERNAL RESEARCH FROM THE COMPANY THAT SHOWS THAT IT'S POTENTIALLY ADDICTIVE THAT IT YOU KNOW HIS BAD OUTCOMES FOR FOR FOLKS -- AND AND POTENTIALLY HELP LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACTS YOU KNOW HURTFUL IMPACTS TO PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND SO OBVIOUSLY FEDERAL LEVEL WE'VE TAKEN AN APPROACH TO REGULATING TOBACCO THE OTHER ANALOGY THAT I'VE HEARD WHICH I WHICH I HEARD FROM A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE IN THE INDUSTRY WHO WORKS FOR ONE OF THESE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WAS THE ANALOGY OF THE SEAT BELT WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW WE INVENTED THE CAR THE CAR WAS A GREAT INVENTION AND IT PROVIDED A LOT OF GREAT -- ALTERNATIVES AND BENEFITS TO PEOPLE -- AT THE SAME TIME WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WERE SOME REST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND SO WE MANDATED PEOPLE TO WEAR SEAT BELTS -- AND SENATE WONDERING JUST WHICH OF THOSE ANALOGIES SPEAKS TO YOU UNDERSTANDING SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE ARE WE IN THE WORLD OF OF OF TOBACCO SHOULD WE BE SHOULD WE BE USING THAT AS THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ARE WE IN THE WORLD OF SEAT BELTS WERE WERE WERE WORKING GREEN I'M JUST CURIOUS OUT PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES BECAUSE THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING IS ON KIDS ON YOUNG PEOPLE -- WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT THIS MORRIS TOBACCO OR DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS MORE SEAT BELTS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE AROUND AUTOMOBILES AND DRIVING ALL OF THE STEPS THAT ARE PUT INTO PLACE FOR DRIVING TO TAKE PLACE THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE WITH STOP SIGNS STOPLIGHTS THERE'S SAFE ROADS THERE'S YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LICENSING PROCESS TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE A CARD BE APPROVED TO DRIVE A CAR THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF STEPS AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S IN THERE TO SUPPORT YOU AS PARENTS WE TEACH OUR KIDS HOW TO LOOK BOTH WAYS AND CROSS THE STREET BUT WE'RE ALSO RELYING ON ALL OF THAT AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE MAKING IT A STATE STREET FOR THEM TO CROSS SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR EXPERIENCE ONLINE WE HAVEN'T REALLY BUILT THAT SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THEM AND SO THAT'S THE ONE THAT I WOULD I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE KIND OF GO WITH IT AS A PARALLEL YEAH I TEND TO THINK OF THIS MORE AS A PRODUCT SAFETY ISSUE OF OF PRODUCTS THAT WE USE AND WE HAVE TO USE ALL THE TIME RATHER THAN IT BEING SOMETHING ABOUT AND -- YOU KNOW A SUBSTANCE THAT WE MAY NOT EVER NEED TO USE WITH LIKE TOBACCO OF YOUNG CHILDREN I THINK OF THE THE TESTING THAT THE FDA DOES OF BABY FOODS I THINK OF THE YOU KNOW TOY TESTING THAT WE DO TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT LEAD AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE LOW GRADE EXPOSURES IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT MAY NOT HAVE A HUGE EXTREME IMPACTS BUT DO MATTER CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVELY OVER TIME AND SO THAT SORT OF STATE PRODUCTS SAFETY PARADIGM MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME ALL RIGHT WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE WITH US TODAY -- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO TRANSITION NOW -- TO OUR SECOND PANEL -- IN WERE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE SOME EXCELLENT SPEAKERS WITH US -- AND THE SECOND PANEL IS GOING TO FOCUS ON DIGITAL LITERACY AND ENCOURAGING HEALTHY TECHNOLOGY PRACTICES AMONG FAMILIES AND YOUTH SO WE HAVE FIRST WITH US IS THAT MERVE LAPUS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF EDUCATION OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA COMMONSENSE HAS LONG BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF PROMOTING DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP AND LITERACY FOR KIDS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US WELL GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR A REALLY PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT AND PRESSING ISSUE -- YOU KNOW AS I JUST KINDA LIKE THINK BACK OF KIND OF WHEN I WAS A KID AND WHAT MEDIAN TECHNOLOGY MEANT TO ME IN SCHOOL AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE NO GONE ARE THE DAYS WHERE IT WAS THERE'S TWO COMPUTERS IN THE BACK RIGHT AND I HAD TO GET EVERYTHING DONE THAT WEEK SO I CAN GO PLAY ORGAN TRAIL AND IF I CAN JUST HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO FORGE THE KANSAS RIVER EVEN JUST GONNA QUIT HUNT YOU KNOW GET THAT BEAR AND THEN BE ABLE TO FEED ALL MY PIONEERING FAMILY BEFORE EVENTUALLY GETTING SICK OF DYSENTERY WHICH IS LIKE THE NORM RIGHT YOU ALL KNOW THE PART THAT WAS THE PROBLEM RIGHT BUT THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF DIGITAL MEDIA KIND OF IN MY LIFE YOU KNOW IT IN SCHOOL AND AS I THINK ABOUT THESE DAYS OF THESE DIGITAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PLAYS REALLY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE AND HOW OUR CHILDREN LEARN COMMUNICATE SHARE AND CREATE ON A DAILY BASIS AND IN SOME WAYS WE'VE HEARD ALMOST EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY JUST WITH SOME OF THE DATA WHICH ARE TODAY AND YES YOU KNOW ACCESS TO RELIABLE TECH AND MEDIA IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR KIDS LEARNING BUT WE ALSO KNOW FROM OUR RESEARCH THAT OUR KIDS ARE BEING EXPOSED TO MORE HURTFUL INSENSITIVE SITUATIONS THIS EXPOSURE HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS ON OUR KIDS MENTAL HEALTH ON A RECENT STUDY WE DID AROUND MENTAL HEALTH -- AND DIGITAL MEDIA WITHOUT SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF BLACK YOUTH OFTEN OR SOMETIMES ENCOUNTER REESE'S CONTENT ONLINE WHEN THEY'RE ONLINE SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF HISPANIC OR LATIN EXCUSE ARE OFTEN OR SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERED RACIST CONTENT ONLINE SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR L. G. B. T. Q. PLUS YOU'VE OFTEN OR SOMETIMES ENCOUNTER HOMOPHOBIC CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND SEVEN IN TEN FEMALE YOUTH OFTEN OR SOMETIMES ENCOUNTER SEXIST OR BODY SHAMING CONTENT WHEN THEY'RE ONLINE RIGHT SO HELPING KIDS COPE WITH WHAT THE EXPERIENCE ONLINE IS JUST ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TEACHING DIGITAL LITERACY IN SCHOOLS IS SO CRITICAL AND ALSO WHY IT HAS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ACCORDING TO A FUTURE OF TECH COMMISSION POLL EIGHTY TWO PERCENT OF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SURVEYED THAT THEY SUPPORT TEACHING DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP SKILLS IN SCHOOL SCHOOLS NOW MORE THAN EVER ARE LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO RESOURCES ASSESS STUDENT LEARNING AND PROVIDE INSTRUCTION TO THE WIDELY DIVERSE NEEDS OF THEIR VARIOUS KIDS AND SCHOOL COMMUNITIES BUT WHAT THIS IS OFTEN LOOK LIKE SO IF YOU'RE CELLS IF YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN I MEAN THE STRUGGLE ITSELF JUST GETTING THEM TO PUT ON THEIR DEVICE TO MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH YOU IS ALREADY A BIG YOU KNOW STRUGGLE LET ALONE ARE THEY EVEN PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT AND I'M SURE THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF TIMES WERE YOU MAYBE SAT BACK AND SAW SOMETHING ONLINE AND JUST LET YOURSELF WHY WOULD ANYONE POST THIS RIGHT NOW IMAGINE IF YOU'RE AN EDUCATOR COMING INTO A CLASSROOM FULL OF THE STUDENTS OR COMING INTO A SCHOOL FULL OF PARENTS COMMUNITY MEMBERS CARE GIVERS YOUR STUDENTS AND THEY'RE ALL USING DEVICES IN VERY SIMILAR WAYS SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT TO EFFECTIVELY TEACH CORE CONTENT IN OUR SCHOOLS IF WE ARE TOO BUSY TRYING TO DEFUSE THE DRAMA THAT LIKELY START ONLINE LAST NIGHT RIGHT HOW CAN WE EXPECT OUR EDUCATORS TO EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY AND FEEL CONFIDENT REALLY LEVERAGING ALL OF ITS OPPORTUNITIES IF WE DON'T BUILD THEIR SKILL AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRAINING FOR THEM IN MY WORLD TEACHING DIGITAL MEDIA LITERACY AND DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP ESCORT TO TEACHING COURSE SUBJECT MATTER CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP WITH THE POWER OF DIGITAL MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY TO EXPLORE CONNECT TO CREATE AND LEARN IN WAYS THAT WE'VE ONLY DREAMED OF GROWING UP AND WITH THIS POWER YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES BUT THEY ALSO FACE CHALLENGES AND DILEMMAS SCHOOLS ARE DEALING WITH RAMIFICATIONS OF ISSUES LIKE ONLINE SAFETY CYBERBULLYING PRIVACY HATE SPEECH MISINFORMATION TECH ADDITION TECH ADDICTION DIGITAL DISTRACTION RIGHT THAT'S JUST SOME OF WHAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH I HAVE A NINE AND ELEVEN YEAR OLD I HEAR ABOUT THESE THINGS ALL THE TIME EITHER WHAT THERE'S EXPERIENCING OR WHAT THEY'RE SEEING ON THE SCHOOL YEAR TO WHAT THEIR FRIENDS ARE TELLING THEM RIGHT SO IF WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY TO BROADBAND AND DIGITAL RESOURCES THEN WE SHOULD BE JUST AS COMMITTED TO EMPOWERING OUR KIDS TO THINK CRITICALLY BEHAVE SAFELY UP PARTICIPATE RESPONSIBLY WITH THE DIGITAL WORLD RIGHT TO BECOME MORE MINDFUL OF EVERYDAY HABITS THAT ARE OTHERWISE AUTOMATIC AND MINDLESS AND IN MANY WAYS THESE MEDIA TOOLS WERE BUILT TO OPERATE THAT WAY AS EDUCATORS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP OUR KIDS UNDERSTAND THEIR LONG TERM ETHICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE USING DIGITAL MEDIA AND OFTENTIMES THE MEDIA AGAIN WAS BUILT FOR THEM TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS REALLY QUICKLY BUT ESPECIALLY IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SO THAT LOOKS LIKE AS ONE EXAMPLE HOW DO WE HELP DEVELOP THINKING ROUTINES FOR KIDS WHEN YOU RUN IT I REMEMBER GROWING UP I WENT RIGHT BY -- AND LISTEN THINKING ROUTINE RIGHT EASY THERE THERE BUT WHAT ARE THE THINKING ROUTINES WHEN OUR KIDS ARE RUNNING INTO SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WHAT IS THAT RED FLAG FEELING THAT THEY FEEL WHAT DO I DO SO THINGS LIKE PAUSING AND THINKING BEFORE THEY LIKE REPLY OR POST OR DEVELOPING A HABIT OF CONSIDERING AND RECONSIDERING THEIR OWN AND OTHERS PERSPECTIVES WHEN THEY EVALUATE AND SHARE RIGHT THESE ARE THINKING ROUTINES THAT WE CAN REINFORCE IN THE CLASSROOM IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING DIGITAL MEDIA LITERACY TRAINING FOR SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES FACING CHILDREN IN OUR FAST CHANGING WORLD MEDIA TECHNOLOGY SO COMMONSENSE ASSURED A MULTITUDE OF RESOURCES AND AND RESEARCH THAT AIDED COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WILL BE HANDING OUT -- THIS CAN BE RELATED TO SOCIAL MEDIA HARMS THE METAVERSE AND TEEN IN MEDIA USE YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN STRUGGLE TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACTS OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH ONLINE CONTENT AND AS A RESULT CHILDREN ARE BEING EXPOSED TO INAPPROPRIATE AND HARMFUL CONTENT THAT MISS INFORMS THEM THAT FINANCIALLY EXPLOITS THEM -- AND CONTRIBUTES TO SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DIGITAL LITERACY INSTRUCTION HELPS EQUIP STUDENTS THEIR FAMILIES AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL STAFF WITH THE KNOWLEDGE TO THOUGHTFULLY NAVIGATE AND SAFELY ENGAGE WITH THE DIGITAL CONTENT AND OFTENTIMES MOST FOR INSTRUCTION IS PROVIDED ON THE SPACES RIGHT SO IT ALSO EMPOWERS YOUNG PEOPLE TO ANALYZE AND ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF CONTENT ON THEIR THOUGHTS FEELINGS AND BEHAVIORS THE CURRICULUM THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SCHOOLS WITH HAS SEEN GREAT SUCCESS ACROSS THE NATION AND EMPOWERING YOUNG PEOPLE TO CONSCIOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUSLY INTERACT WITH THE DIGITAL WORLD IDEALLY I SEE I FORESEE A FUTURE WHERE STUDENTS LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THEY THINK BEFORE THEY POST SOMETHING PROBLEMATIC ONLINE A WORLD WHERE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS KNOW HOW TO TALK TO THEIR STUDENTS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA CHALLENGES AND CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING THAT ORDER PARENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE FLAGGING DISTRESSING INSTANCES ONLINE AND ROLE MODEL HOW WE SHOULD BE NAVIGATING THE SPACE TOGETHER -- IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO SAY CALIFORNIA HAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS CRITICAL MEDIA AND TECH ISSUES THAT IMPACT US ALL AND CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT EMPOWERS EDUCATORS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO NAVIGATE THE VASTUS OF THE INTERNET IN A SAFE AND PRODUCTIVE WAY WE ARE NOT JUST RAISING LEADERS OF TOMORROW HER KIDS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN OUR COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW RIGHT SO IT IS OUR DUTY TO ACT ON THIS OPPORTUNITY AND PROVIDE THE NEEDED RESOURCES FOR OUR SCHOOLS IN THIS GROWING CONNECTED WORLD THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DID NEXT LIKE TO WELCOME AMELIA VANCE SHE IS THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC INTEREST PRIVACY CONSULTING INFORMALLY THE

TWELVE EDUCATION HOW PRIVACY IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF CHILDREN'S WELL BEING AND HOW POLICYMAKERS CAN CREATE EVIDENCE BASED PRIVACY LAWS THAT STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN SUPPORT WITHOUT HIM AND I GO AHEAD AND TRY TO SHARE MY SCREEN AND HOPE THAT I SUCCEED ALL RIGHT IT'S SO PRIVACY IS A MUCH BROADER CONCEPT THAN MANY PEOPLE REALIZE BY CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY HAS A PROJECT ASKING PEOPLE TO DRAW WHAT PRIVACY MEANS TO THEM MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY CHILDREN SEE PRIVACY THROUGH THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PEOPLE IN THEIR LIVES SO THE PRIVACY THAT COMES FROM BEING ALONE HAVING A PRIVATE SPACE SEPARATE FROM OTHER PEOPLE PRIVACY FROM PHYSICAL EXPOSURE THE PRIVACY OF THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AND US KIDS GROW UP THEY START TO UNDERSTAND PRIVACY MORE BROADLY HAVING PASSWORDS ON ACCOUNTS COMPANIES POTENTIALLY WATCHING WHAT THE ACCESS CAMERAS IN SCHOOL HALLWAYS AND GROCERY STORES WITH SO MANY INTERPRETATIONS HOW CAN WE DEFINE PRIVACY CERTAINLY PRIVACY IS RECOGNIZED AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND IN MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS WE KNOW THAT PRIVACY CAN INCLUDE A PERSON'S CONTROL ABOUT HOW THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED BUT MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY THE WORD PRIVACY IS USED AS A PROXY FOR FAIRNESS WE OFTEN DON'T GET A REAL CHOICE ABOUT HOW INFORMATION IS USED BY GOVERNMENT AND SCHOOLS AND COMPANIES THE MORE INFORMATION THAT ONE PERSON OR ORGANISATION HAS ABOUT ANOTHER THE MORE THAT PARTY MAY INFLUENCE OR EXERT POWER OVER THE OTHER RIVA C. PROTECTIONS GIVE US RIGHTS THAT CAN EMPOWER AND WORKS TO CORRECT THOSE POWER IMBALANCES AS PREVIOUS PANELISTS TESTIFIED PRIVACY HARMS CAN BE MUCH MORE POTENT FOR CHILDREN AS I'VE TALKED TO THOUSANDS OF STAKEHOLDERS I FOUND THAT CONCERNS OVER CHILD PRIVACY CAN BE BOILED DOWN TO THESE RISKS PARENTS WORRY ABOUT SAFETY ABOUT OVER COLLECTION AND OVER SURVEILLANCE HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED ABOUT MY CHILD THEY WORRY ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION OUR COMPANY SELLING MY CHILD'S DAUGHTER TARGETING ADVERTISING TO THEM THEY WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEIR CHILD'S MISTAKES WILL BE RECORDED FOREVER PARENTS WORRY THAT THEIR CHILD WILL MISS OUT ON OPPORTUNITIES PERHAPS BECAUSE OF BIASED INFORMATION OR INFORMATION THAT IS USED IN AN INEQUITABLE WAY THEY ALSO WORRY THAT CHILDREN WILL ACCESS INAPPROPRIATE CONTENTS AND PARENTS WORRY ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED TO BULLY THEIR CHILD OR HOW INFORMATION COLLECTED LIKE MENTAL HEALTH DATA COULD STIGMATIZE THEIR CHILD THESE RISKS CAN BE EXACERBATED WHEN WE ONLY THINK ABOUT A STEREO TYPICAL STUDENT ONE CREATE M. PROGRAMS OR POLICIES CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WHO MAY BE LGBT Q.

JUST INTEREST ONLY FOR YOU TO REACT TO MISTER ABBAS AND M. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT WE HEARD FROM THAT FROM THE FIRST PANEL THE WORDS THAT KEPT COMING OVER UP FOR ME WERE CONTROL AGENCY AUTONOMY POWER -- IT SEEM LIKE A BIG PART OF THIS IS THAT THE FACT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE CONTROL RIGHT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE FOR PARENTS AS WELL I CERTAINLY I CERTAINLY FEEL THAT WAY WHEN MY FOUR YEAR OLD IS SCROLLING THROUGH YOUTUBE AND AND ENCOUNTERING CONTENT THAT I WORRY ABOUT M. IN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INTRIGUED ME ABOUT DIGITAL LITERACY IS IT SEEMS LIKE A WAY TO ACTUALLY PUT CONTROL BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO ARE ON THE OTHER AND -- YOU KNOW THE CONSUMERS THE KIDS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES -- AND SO I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT -- MAY THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THINGS THAT ARE PUTTING CONTROL ON THE OTHER END QUITE YET IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPERS AND THE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS LIMITED AND SO WE ARE FORCED TO ALMOST ENSURE THAT OUR KIDS AND THAT EVEN OURSELVES UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS WORK SO THAT WE CAN MAKE MORE THOUGHTFUL DECISIONS I THINK IT'S VERY EASY BECAUSE WE LIVE IN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE ABLE TO GET THINGS AS WE NEED IT RAPIDLY AND FAST AND WE START TO ASSOCIATE AND THE WAY THAT WE JUST NORMALIZE HOW WE USE THINGS AND I'M USE THE TERM EARLIER LIKE WE JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH THINGS ALMOST IN A MINDLESS WAY BECAUSE IT'S MEANT FOR THAT I MEAN REALLY THE THE VALUE OF YOUR ATTENTION IS INCREDIBLY HIGH AND SO AS YOU PAY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING AS AS RACY AS IT MIGHT BE OR UNCOMFORTABLE AS IT MIGHT BE THAT TELLS THE ALGORITHM TO SPEND WITH THIS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE ALGORITHM WORKS YOU'LL EASILY GET TIED INTO IT SO HOW DO WE REALLY MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT USING THEM SO THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING USED BUT MORE POORLY HOW CAN YOU USE IT FOR WHAT YOU NEED AND WHAT YOU INTEND I THINK WITH MY NINE ELEVEN YEAR OLD ONE OF THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THEM ON IS GIVING THEM THE LANGUAGE SO WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THEY KNOW THAT WHEN THEY COME TO ME IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW WHAT REMOVE THE DEVICE OR YOU'RE OFF THAT PLATFORM WHICH IS A BIG FEAR FOR A LOT OF KIDS ESPECIALLY KIDS THAT ARE JUST KIND OF EXPLORING IT NOW GAINING ACCESS TO THESE PLATFORMS SO PROVIDING THEM REALLY THE LANGUAGE AND WROTE RECOGNITION THAT WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT IS NOT OKAY HERE'S HOW WE ADDRESS THOSE THINGS AND WORK THROUGH IT AND THE SAME WAY IN THE CLASSROOM WHERE SOMETIMES AND AM I ACTUALLY OFTENTIMES EDUCATORS WILL FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SO I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN PUT MYSELF IN IT EVEN THOUGH THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND REALLY HIGH QUALITY CONTENT ON A PLATFORM LIKE YOU TOO CAN THEN BE MET WITH SEVEN CLICKS AWAY LIKE I'M LOOKING UP THOMAS THE TRAIN AND SEVEN CLICKS AWAY ALL OF US IN THERE TRAINS HITTING AUTOMOBILES RIGHT VERY EASILY SO RECOGNIZING HOW THESE THINGS WORK SO THAT AS EDUCATORS WE CAN BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE PREPARING KIDS TO REALLY THROUGH CRITICALLY ABOUT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR LET'S GIVE YOU THE SKILLS THAT YOU CAN USE TARGETED WORD SEARCH AND EFFECTIVE WAY YOU SIGN IMAGE TO MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THANK LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN TALK THROUGH THAT WHO CAN YOU GO TO WHERE THE TRUSTED ADULTS I KNOW THAT THERE'S A CULTURE IN A SCHOOL THAT RECOGNIZED TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME HARMS IF WE DON'T PREPARE OURSELVES TO ADDRESS SO MANY OF OUR KIDS DON'T TRUST THAT WE CAN GO TO AN EDUCATOR OR A PARENT OR ANYONE LIKE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE TO WHOM IS FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THEY KNOW ALL THESE THINGS AND IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER KID IN CLASS OR ANOTHER KID MAYBE YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY OLDER WHO'S ALSO STILL NAVIGATING HE'S YOU KNOW CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE RUNNING TO ONLINE RIGHT SO WHEN YOUR POSITION YOUR QUESTION ARE WE MORE LIKE OTHER I THINK WE'RE OPERATING AROUND WHAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO AT THIS POINT AND SO EMPOWERING OUR KIDS TO THINK CRITICALLY BECAUSE REALITY IS THERE WILL BE NEW TECHNOLOGY TOMORROW THERE WILL BE A NEW ISSUE TOM YEAH ACT THREE THREE YEARS FROM NOW THEY'LL BE IN A NEW PIECE OF TECH SO HOW MUCH ARE WE GETTING OUR KIDS USE THE FILTERS THAT ARE BETWEEN THIRTY YEARS -- AND REALLY EMPOWERING THEM TO THINK THROUGH THOSE EXPERIENCES I'M IS GONNA BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS WE WORK TO REALLY LOOKING AT HOW THEN DOES THAT CREATE THESE PLATFORMS ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL AND AND CENTERING THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR KIDS AND THAT'S SOMETIME FROM NOW WHAT I CAN DO RIGHT NOW WHAT EDUCATORS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THERE'S GREAT OPPORTUNITIES WITH TECH WHICH IS WHY THERE'S SO MUCH TAKE A CLASSROOMS SO WE NEED TO REALLY BUILD THE SKILLS FOR KIDS TO USE IN REALLY MEANINGFUL WAYS AND REALLY THINK CRITICALLY HOW THEY USE IT YEAH I I APPRECIATE THAT AND IT'S YOU KNOW I WAS STRUCK BOTH BY WHAT YOU SAID BY WHAT'S IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER BY WHAT WE HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR WITNESSES ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY NOT FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO RIGHT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY THAT THEY CAN TALK TO THAT THEY ENCOUNTER SOMETHING PROBLEMATIC THEY'RE NOT SURE TO THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE STATISTICS ABOUT YOU KNOW AMERICAN TEENAGER SPENDING SEVEN POINT SEVEN HOURS ONLINE I MEAN WHAT SORT OF A I DON'T IS THERE ANYTHING I MEAN THEY'RE GETTING MORE HOURS OF INSTRUCTION FROM YOU KNOW SNAPCHAT AND GOOGLE AND YOUTUBE THAN THEY MIGHT BE GETTING FROM PARENTS AND TEACHERS SO THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW I I WORRY ABOUT YOU WE WE WE OBVIOUSLY CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS AS AS AS EDUCATORS AS POLICY MAKERS AS PARENTS ABOUT WHAT IS THE MATERIAL THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS AND WHAT ARE THEY RECEIVING AND HOW IS THAT HELPING TO SHAPE THEM THE QUESTION IS ARE WE ALSO HAVING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO WITH THE SEVEN POINT SEVEN HOURS OF TIME THEY'RE SPENDING ONLINE YEAH YOU KNOW I COMPLETELY AGREE AND I THINK IT'S ANOTHER REALITY HAVE TO ADDRESS IS THE FACT THAT WE'RE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT WORLD RIGHT NOW RIGHT WHEN I GREW UP IF THE LIGHTS WENT ON OUTSIDE I WAS STILL WELL WITHIN MY MEANS TO BE RUNNING AROUND OF MY FRIENDS YOU KNOW OUTSIDE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S NOT THE CASE THESE DAYS SO DEVELOPMENTALLY KIDS ARE WHAT GOING TO BE WHERE THEIR FRIENDS ARE AND THOSE THEIR FRIENDS ARE IN ONLINE SPACES WHETHER IT BE THROUGH GAMING WITH THEIR FRIENDS OR ON DISCORD OR OTHER PLATFORMS SO IF THAT IS BECOMING KIND OF A NEW NORM THAT OUR KIDS AREN'T OUTSIDE AS MUCH REACTIVE ME INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER OR JUST KIND OF NAVIGATING YOU KNOW THE OUTSIDE WORLD THEY'RE GONNA BE WHERE THEIR FRIENDS ARE AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN ONLINE SPACES AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THINKING THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT HOW WE PROVIDE THEM -- YOU KNOW REALLY THAT THE SKILL IN THE RESOURCE TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA SPEND ALL YOUR TIME THERE CARE THE THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT AROUND CRITICAL THINKING IT'S STILL VERY IMPORTANT AND SO MUCH OF THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT RESTRICTING OUR ACCESS OR IT REALLY IS AROUND ARE THEY THINKING CRITICALLY TO THEY REALIZE THERE'S AN ALGORITHM THAT IS CAUSING ME TO SEE THIS THING AT THIS TIME WITH AND A LOT OF THAT IS ABOUT WHAT OUR TEACHERS CAN PROVIDE IN TERMS OF OKAY YOU'RE LOOKING UP THESE RESOURCES FOR AN ASSIGNMENT WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS NEWSPAPER IS TRYING TO TELL YOU VERSES THIS NEWSPAPER FROM ARTIFACT DESIGN THE MOST LIKELY MACHINE WHICH IS A GAME THAT MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLERS CAN PLAY TO TRY AND PREDICT OUT WHICH FAMOUS FIGURES -- WOULD BE VOTED YOU KNOW BEST IN CLASS -- OR -- YOU KNOW MOST CREATIVE AND THEN CREATE AN ALGORITHM TO SHOW THOSE THINGS THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE UP THOSE PERSON THOSE CHARACTERISTICS AND IT IT'S A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR KIDS TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY OH WHAT I ASSUME TO VERSUS WHAT THIS ALGORITHM DOES IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND CRITICAL THINKING REALLY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING STAFF AND AND THE TOOL THAT WE NEED TO GIVE KIDS AREN'T MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I KNOW THAT -- THE CHAIR HAD A I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO CHAIR WELL I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION I GO BACK TO A MILLION AS A SLIDE WITH LIKE IT'S SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON YOUR BUBBLE IT'S EASY TO SAY WAS APPARENT I'VE DECIDED I'VE LOOKED AT ALL THE EVIDENCE I SAID THIS IS WHAT MY KIDS CAN'T DO THIS MY MY KIDS CAN'T DO MY DAUGHTER IS ON MY OWN YOUTUBE CHANNEL SO I JUST HAVE TO CHECK MY OWN YOUTUBE HISTORY ON MY PHONE TO SEE WHAT SHE'S BEEN DOING -- HENCE I KNEW ABOUT THE QUESTIONING -- BUT YOU HAD A SIDE THAT SAID ALL THE OTHER GROUPS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT I THINK IT'S CALIFORNIA WE LEAD ON THAT EQUITY SIDE AND I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO APPROACH THIS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THERE ARE PARENTS WORKING THREE JOBS THAT DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO SIT AND SAY THIS PLATFORM AS OKAY THIS PLATFORM IS NOT I'M GONNA CHECK MY KIDS YOU TO HISTORY I'M NOT SO WE HAVE TO I THINK THINK ABOUT IT MORE THERE'S A PLACE FOR EDUCATION I THINK THERE'S A PLACE WHERE GOVERNMENT -- AND PUBLIC EDUCATION ON THIS WITH BOTH OF THE PARENTS AND THE STUDENTS ARE HELPING CRITICAL TO CREATE THOSE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS TO MAKE THAT EVALUATION BECAUSE I COULD DO THAT AS A PARENT BECAUSE I HAVE THE LUXURY AND THE PRIVILEGE OF THAT TIME AND EDUCATION DO SO BUT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR POLICIES I THINK EQUITY LENDS A SUPER IMPORTANT AND THAT WAS MY THOUGHT THAT CAN AFFECT PANEL DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M GONNA GLASCOFF ANYONE FOR THE COMMITTEE -- I THINK MAYBE THAT WAS OUR SIGN THAT IT'S YOU VERY MUCH TO OUR WITNESSES APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW I WANT TO WELCOME OUR THIRD AND FINAL PANEL WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS -- SOME OTHER PROACTIVE APPROACHES TO PRIVACY AND SAFETY FOR CHILDREN ONLINE FIRST TIME HONOR TO WELCOME OUR GUEST WHO WINS THE AWARD FOR TRAVELING THE FARTHEST -- THAT IS FAIRNESS BEAVAN KETRON SHE IS THE FOUNDER AND CHAIR OF THE FIVE RIGHTS FOUNDATION IN INTERNATIONAL CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO BUILDING THE DIGITAL WORLD YOUNG PEOPLE DESERVE SHE'S ALSO A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS SO WE'RE DELIGHTED TO WELCOME YOU TO THE GREEN CARPET I KNOW YOU'RE USUALLY USED TO THE RED CARPET AND -- HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT WITH HER -- EVENTS OF THE HEARING AND I WAS ASKING HER WHAT THE APPROPRIATE HONORIFIC IS BECAUSE SHE'S A AND BARONESS AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND SO I LEARNED THAT I TECHNICALLY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO REFER TO HER AS MILADY SO IF YOU WANT TO BE A APPROPRIATE YOU CAN ADDRESS ARE THAT WAY -- BUT I'M GONNA SAY WELCOME BARONESS WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE M. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT CHAD AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO ADDRESS YOU -- AND THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT IS A TIMELY AND CRITICAL ISSUES SITE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO BE IN YOUR HOUSE AM I AM AS AS AS SAID BARONESS BE BANKING DRAWN I WAS A MOVIE DIRECTED THIRTY JENS AND FOR THE PAST DECADE I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS WHERE I SIT AS A CROSS BENCH PIA MEANING I'M NOT ALIGNED WITH ANY POLITICAL COUNTY I HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF DIGITAL POLICY EXPERTISE BUT BEST KNOWN IN REGULATE TREE CIRCLES AS THE ARCHITECT OF THE UK'S AGE APPROPRIATE DESIGN CODE THE CODE WENT INTO EFFECT IN SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR AND IT HAS SHOWN THAT IF YOU FOCUS THE PRODIGIOUS CREATIVITY OF THE TECH SECTOR SQUARELY ON THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN YOU CAN PROTECT THEM I'M ALSO CHAIR FIVE RIGHTS FOUNDATION WHICH IS DRIVEN BIG IMPROVEMENTS TO CHILD SAFETY ONLINE ACROSS EUROPE AFRICA ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA AND OVER THE PAST DECADE I'VE WORKED WITH MANY CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE WHILE THEY ARE UNITED AND THAT LOVE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND THEY ARE EQUALLY UNITED IN THEIR DESIRE THAT IT SHOULD BE KINDA FARAH AND MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS AND I AM HERE TODAY ON THAT BEHALF IF YOU REWIND A LITTLE BIT TO THE INTERNET'S EARLY DAYS AND SPEND TIME AS I HAVE DONE WITH SOME OF ITS ORIGINAL ARCHITECTS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE AIMS WHEN NOBLE THEY IMAGINED A DEMOCRATIZING TECHNOLOGY NO GATEKEEPERS WHAT WILL USES WOULD BE EQUAL THIS EQUALITY WAS PART OF A GRAND VISION BUT THERE IS A CATCH IF YOU TREAT EVERYONE EQUALLY YOU TREAT A CHILD AS IF THEY WERE AN ACT OF IT IS ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN THE HISTORY OF TECHNOLOGY THAT THE DIGITAL WORLD HAS SIMPLY NOT BEEN DESIGNED WITH CHILDREN IN MIND CHILDREN HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SPEND A LARGE SHARE OF THAT TIME IN THE DIGITAL REALM IT IS WHERE THEY BUILD RELATIONSHIPS STUDY PLAY FIND INFORMATION AND HOPEFULLY AS THEY MATURE THEY PARTICIPATE IN CIVIC LIFE AND AND DEMOCRACY BUT A CHILD IS A CHILD UNTIL THEY MATURE NOT UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY PICK UP A SMALL FUND IN TWENTY TWELVE I MADE A FILM ABOUT TEENAGERS LIFE ONLINE I SPEND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN KIDS BEDROOMS IF THEY WERE GOING TO MEETUPS I WENT TO MEET UPS IF THEY WERE WATCHING PORN I WAS WATCHING PORN IF THEY WERE GAMING THROUGH THE NIGHT SO WAS I I HAVE SEEN UP CLOSE SOME OF THE HOMES THAT RESULT FROM A SYSTEM THAT ENCOURAGES BEHAVIORS AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SIMPLY TOO MUCH FOR A CHILD'S EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN LIFE EXPERIENCE WE CAN OVER REAL LAW FOR CANON OF HOMES DEPRESSION BODY DYSMORPHIA SELF HARM AND SUICIDE HATE SPEECH EXTORTION VIOLENCE SEXUAL CONTENT GAMBLING OR BEING A VICTIM OF CRIMINAL SEXUAL ABUSE AND IN THE COURSE OF MY WORK I ROUTINELY DEAL WITH CHILDREN WITH THREE PARENTS AND WITH TEACHERS WHO FEEL POWERLESS IN THE FACE OF THOSE HOMES THE HARM IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR BUT EQUALLY THE FEATURES THE EXACERBATE AND AMPLIFY ON I'M NOT ELECTIONS THEY ALL FEATURES OF DIGITAL SERVICE AND IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY THE TECHNOLOGY CHILDREN USING IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ENGINEERED AND CAN BE OPTIMIZED FOR ANY PURPOSE INCLUDING CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND WELL BEING A SENIOR LEADER OF A LARGE TECHNOLOGY FOUND RECENTLY TOLD ME THAT HIS PRODUCT ENGINEERS FOUND THE CONCEPT OF DESIGNING TO PUT CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS FLESTE A VERY REWARDING TASK HE ALSO ADDED THEY SIMPLY HADN'T BEEN ASKED TO DO IT FOR WHICH IS WHY ULTIMATELY I'M A TECHNOLOGY OPTIMIST AND A PRACTICE TEST THE JOURNEY TO THE DIGITAL WORLD CHILDREN DESERVE STARTS WITH THIS QUESTION IF YOU KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT YOUR PRODUCT END USER WAS A CHILD WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY FASTER AFTER KNOWLEDGE THAT CHILD TO DOES NOT AND TWELVE THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS IS STILL IN THE MAELSTROM OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT ON THE WAY TO ACT OUT THAT TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THAT IMPULSE IS TRYING TO MAKE RATIONAL INFORMED DECISIONS THEY STRUGGLE AND THE DIGITAL WELL DESIGNED TO NUDGE THEM INTO BEHAVING AS THE ENEMY THAT AGE APPROPRIATE NORTH SAY SECOND WE MUST AS UP AS OF SENATE ADULT CHILD CENTERED DESIGN OR SAFETY BY DESIGN AS MANY CORNET NO ENVIRONMENT IS A HUNDRED PERCENT SAFE BUT TOO MANY DIGITAL PRODUCTS ALIKE BECAUSE WITHOUT SEAT BELTS -- BREAKS I'M AS A CHILD AT THE WHEEL IT'S TIME FOR SAFETY OPERATE FIVE RIGHTS HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS THE IEEE ON SAFETY BY DESIGN FRAME WHAT THAT NUDGES INNOVATORS TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AT EVERY STAGE IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE FROM ITS CREATION DEVELOPMENT BE TO TESTING DISTRIBUTION EVEN ITS RETIREMENT FROM ME WORKING DIRECTLY WITH ENGINEERS WAS REGULATORY THEY ARE NATURAL PROBLEM SOLVERS AND THEY MADE KIA OPTIMIZING FOR CHILDREN DEPENDS CHIEFLY ON THE WILLINGNESS OF COMPANIES TOP LEADERSHIP TO SAY YES THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES EMINENTLY FEASIBLE THANK AND FINALLY WE MUST PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY WHEN HARVESTING PROCESSING AND MONETIZING UPDATED DEFINES THE FEATURES OF PRODUCTS AND CULTURE OF AN INDUSTRY IT FOLLOWS THAT DATA PROTECTION IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO CHANGE A CHILD'S LIVED EXPERIENCE WHICH BRINGS ME NEATLY TO THE UK'S AGE APPROPRIATE DESIGN CODE IT'S THREE OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES ON THE ANY PERSON UNDER EIGHTEEN MUST BE ACCORDED SPECIFIC DATA PROTECTION THAT THOSE PROTECTIONS BE APPLIED TO ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LIKELY TO BE ACCESSED BY CHILDREN WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT CHILDREN SPEND MOST OF THAT TIME IN PLACE IS NOT UNIQUELY DIRECTED AT THEM FOR EXAMPLE INSTAGRAM YOU CHOOSE PICKED UP GAMING AND THAT THOSE PROTECTIONS WILL BE OFFERED BY DESIGN AND DEFAULT THAT IS TO SAY NOT BY COMPLICATED OR HIDDEN TOOLS BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD BAKED IN DEFAULTS IN ADDITION THERE ARE FIFTEEN STANDARDS THE ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THOSE IN THE CALIFORNIA AGE APPROPRIATE DESIGN A BILL INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BUFFY WICKS AND JORDAN CUNNINGHAM AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM HERE BUT I CAN TRACE EACH ONE OF THEM TO AN INDIVIDUAL STORY OF A CHILD HIS NAME'S FOR THE REASONS YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND OF CHANGE IT WAS PATEL WHO TOLD ME THAT A STRANGER USED A MAP SHOWING HAVE REAL TIME LOCATION TO FIND HER IN REAL LIFE THAT LED TO STANDARD TO TEN WHICH REQUIRES JUNE LOCATION FEATURES TO BE OFF BY DEFAULT IT WAS MARK HE SAID HE WAS INCAPABLE OF HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH A REAL GIRL BECAUSE HE'D BEEN WATCHING PORN SINCE THE AGE OF EIGHT BUT LIKE TO STAND TO TWELVE WHICH PREVENTS PROFILING TO DELIVER DETRIMENTAL MATERIAL IT WAS GRACE HIS FAVORITE GAME TOOK THREE HOURS TO COMPLETE BUT HAD NO SAVE BUTTON SO WHEN CORD FOR DINNER BEDTIME OF SCHOOL THE POWERFUL POINT OF THE GAME AND THE INABILITY TO POLLS MADE HAVE REFUSED TO PUT IT DOWN WHICH IN TURN CAUSED EXTREME MARITAL DISCORD FOR WHICH SHE STILL BLAMES HERSELF THIS CAN THIS IS CAPTURED IN STANDARD THIRTEEN THAT PREVENTS DUNGEONS INCLUDING DELIBERATELY EXTENDING USE AND REPETITIVE WHO WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO ACCESS THE ONLINE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OFFERED BY HIS SCHOOL BECAUSE HE FEARED THE INFORMATION WOULD BE SHAD WHICH LED TO STANDARD NINE ABOUT DATA SHARING AND SO ON THE CODE BECAME LAW IN SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR AND ALREADY WE'VE SEEN SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES GOOGLE HAS MADE SAFE SUCH THE DEFAULT BROWSING MODE FOR UNDER EIGHTEENS YOU TRIP TURNED OFF AUTOPLAY BREAKING BEDTIME REMINDERS THAT TURNED ON AS DEFAULTS TICTOC ON INSTAGRAM OF CHANGE THAT DEFAULT PRIVACY SETTINGS FOR JOBS USES INCLUDING IMPORTANTLY DISABLING OF DIRECT MESSAGES BETWEEN CHILDREN AND ADULTS THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE NOW PREVENTS UNDER EIGHTEENS FROM VIEWING AND DOWNLOADING APPS RATED ACTIVE ADULTS ONLY AND CHILDREN AGE THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN ON TICTOC DO NOT RECEIVE PUSH NOTIFICATIONS AFTER NINE PM AND THOSE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN HAVE PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DISABLED STARTING AT TEN TO SUM UP THE CODES FIFTEEN STANDARDS ARE INTERCONNECTED AND INTERDEPENDENT BUT TOGETHER THEY ESTABLISH THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PRIVACY AND SAFETY THEY SHOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IS JUST AS CAPABLE AS ANY OTHER SECTOR TO CHECK THEIR PRODUCTS FOR SAFETY AND THEY ESTABLISH BEYOND DOUBT THAT LAWMAKERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY TO THOSE IN THE TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY MANY OF WHOM LIVE WORK AND RAISE THEIR CHILDREN NOT FROM FROM WHERE WE ARE TODAY I ONLY ASK THAT DO YOU USE YOUR GIFTS TO PROTECT AS WELL AS TO ENTERTAIN AND EDUCATE OUR KIDS TO SUPPORT INNOVATION THAT KEEPS CHILDREN IN MIND TACKLE THE PROBLEM BE THE SOLUTION IN THE U. K. THERE IS A STRONG BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS THAT WE NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN A PROPORTIONATE AND SYSTEMIC WAY BUT WE DO NEED THE STRENGTH AND AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES TO SUPPORT WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST DESIGN UPGRADE FOR CHILDREN IN DECADES AND UPGRADE THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS TO ACCEPT BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT STOPPED IT FROM THRIVING THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE ALL THE PROTECTIONS NOW FORGET THOSE IN THE U. K. AND AS CALIFORNIA IS THE BEACON AT THAT AS THE TOWN CALIFORNIA IS THE BEACON FOR THE WHOLE WORLD IN TERMS OF TACK THE ADOPTION OF THIS COAT WOULD BE CRUCIAL TO SET A GLOBAL STANDARD THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD AND LOOKING ON AND THEY NEED YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FAIRNESS WE ARE NOW GOING TO TURN TO OUR SECOND WITNESS DILLON HOFFMAN HE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR TECHNET FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE SOUTHWEST PRIOR TO JOINING TECHNET HE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION WORD ON THE STREET IS ALSO GREAT LEAD STAFFER WELL DONE IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE -- AS MENTIONED MY NAME IS DON HOFFMAN I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA THE SOUTHWEST OF TECHNET AND TECHNET IS THE NATIONAL BIPARTISAN NETWORK OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THAT PROMOTES THE GROWTH OF THE INNOVATION ECONOMY OUR DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES DYNAMIC AMERICAN BUSINESSES RANGING FROM START UPS TO THE MOST ICONIC COMPANIES ON THE PLANET AND REPRESENTS OVER FOUR MILLION EMPLOYEES AND COUNTLESS CUSTOMERS IN THE FIELDS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY E-COMMERCE THE SHARING ECONOMY ADVANCED ENERGY CYBERSECURITY AND FINANCE TO NAME ONLY A FEW FIRST CHILDREN'S PRIVACY AND SECURITY IS A PRIORITY FOR OUR COMPANIES WE STRONGLY BELIEVE CHILDREN DESERVE A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EFFORTS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY TO INCORPORATE PROTECTIVE DESIGN FEATURES AND OTHER WEBSITES AND PLATFORMS OUR COMPANIES HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF RAISING THE STANDARD FOR TEEN SAFETY AND PRIVACY ACROSS OUR INDUSTRY BY CREATING NEW FEATURES SETTINGS AND PROTECTIONS THAT ARE AGE APPROPRIATE AND TAILORED TO THE DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE SOME COMPANIES HAVE CREATED FEATURES TO EMPOWER TEAMS TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL FOR THEM SUCH AS REMINDERS TO TAKE BREAKS REASON SETTINGS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM POTENTIAL THREATS OR UNWANTED CONTACT ADDITIONALLY OUR COMPANY'S OF ROLLED OUT NEW FEATURES TO INCLUDE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS IN THEIR TEENS EXPERIENCES BY BUILDING PARENTAL STRICT SUPERVISION TOOLS TO GIVE THEM MORE INSIGHT AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS TO ENCOURAGE DIALOGUE BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR TEAMS ON HOW TO NAVIGATE THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA WHILE PROVIDING A SAFE EXPERIENCE FOR USERS PROTECTING THE PRIVACY ONLINE AND COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS IS THE GOAL IS NOT WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES IN FACT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE VALUES OF PRIVACY AND SECURITY CAN BE INTENTION AGE VERIFICATION IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE'S AGE ON THE INTERNET IS A COMPLEX CHALLENGE ACROSS OUR INDUSTRY MANY OF ARE COPPA COMPLIANT PLATFORMS ALREADY HAVE VARIOUS METHODS OF IDENTIFYING REMOVING ACCOUNTS USED BY PEOPLE WHO MISREPRESENT THEIR AGE BUT THEY'RE NOT FOOLPROOF -- FINE EACH USER'S AGE COULD PROVIDE A SAFER MORE SECURE EXPERIENCE ONLINE BY DEFINITIVELY IDENTIFYING WHICH USERS ARE UNDER AGE AND BLOCKING THEM FROM ACCESSING INAPPROPRIATE SITES AND CONTENT HOWEVER THIS WOULD REQUIRE COLLECTING MORE SENSE OF INFORMATION WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO DATA MINIMISATION PRINCIPLES BEYOND MINIMIZING DATA SELF FOR VERIFICATION OR COLLECTING IDENTIFICATION HAS LIMITATIONS FIRST SELF VERIFICATIONS TO EASY TO GET AROUND AS ANYONE WHO HAS ACCESS TO AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE SITE CAN ATTEST THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN ID ID COLLECTION ISN'T A FAIR OR EQUITABLE SOLUTION EITHER ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT ID'S VARIES DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE AS IS THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN A NINETY SUCH AS A BIRTHDAY CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING AS TO HOW WE AS AN INDUSTRY CAN IMPROVE THE PROCESS AND WORK TOGETHER TO SHARE INFORMATION AND PRIVACY PRESERVING WAYS THE HELP SITES ESTABLISH WHETHER PEOPLE ARE OVER A SPECIFIC AGE ONE AREA WE BELIEVE HAS REAL PROMISE IS WORKING WITH OPERATING SYSTEM PROVIDERS INTERNET BROWSERS AND OTHER PROVIDERS SO THEY CAN SHARE INFORMATION TO HELP WEBSITES AND APPS ESTABLISHED WHETHER SOMEONE IS OF AN APPROPRIATION THIS HAS THE DUAL BENEFIT OF HELPING DEVELOPERS KEEP UNDERAGE PEOPLE OFF THEIR PLATFORMS OR MOVING IN THE NEED TO GO THROUGH DIFFERENT AND POTENTIALLY CUMBERSOME AGE VERIFICATION PROCESSES ACROSS MULTIPLE SITES AND SERVICES WELL IT'S ULTIMATELY UP TO INDIVIDUAL WEBSITES TO ENFORCE THEIR AGE POLICIES AND COMPLY WITH THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS COLLABORATION WITH OPERATING SYSTEM PROVIDERS INTERNET BROWSERS AND OTHERS WOULD BE A HELPFUL ADDITION TO THOSE EFFORTS LIKE TO CLOSE QUICKLY WITH SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR POLICYMAKERS WHEN CONSIDERING NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC THE BEST RULES AND LAWS THE ONES THAT WILL PROTECT CHILDREN THE MOST ARE ONES THAT CAN BE CONSISTENTLY EASILY AND RELIABLY COMPLIED WITH CLEAR BRIGHT LINE RULES ARE PREFERABLE TO VAGUE SUBJECTIVE ONES RULES IN TERMS THAT ARE CLEARLY DEFINED WILL ENSURE MORE CONSISTENT COMPLIANCE AND ADHERENCE TO THOSE RULES WITHOUT SUCH DEFINITIONS COMPANIES MAY REACH DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF STANDARDS WHICH WILL RESULT IN UNEVEN APPLICATION ONLINE ACROSS SITES AND PLATFORMS ADDITIONALLY FAIR AND CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES WITH THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE REGULATORY GUIDANCE OR FIX VIOLATIONS WILL BE NECESSARY MANY PROPOSED LAWS PARTICULARLY PERTAINING TO CHILDREN REQUIRED DIFFICULT VALUE JUDGMENTS ON THE PART OF COMPANIES THESE DECISIONS DON'T FALL NEATLY INTO GOOD OR BAD RIGHT OR WRONG REGULATORS WILL DISAGREE WITH COMPANIES ABOUT THEIR DECISIONS AND COMPANIES WILL MAKE MISTAKES I'M TRYING TO COMPLY IN GOOD FAITH WITH THESE LOTS HER JUMPING IMMEDIATELY TO FINES OR CIVIL LIABILITY WILL CREATE UNEVEN ENFORCEMENT OF SUBJECT RULES AND SERVE ONLY TO HARM BUSINESS AND IT BENEFIT ATTORNEYS FINES IN LITIGATION WILL ALSO LEAD TO OVER CORRECTIONS WHICH WILL INEVITABLY LIMIT ACCESS TO KIDS PROVIDING ROBUST GUIDANCE AND FEEDBACK FROM REGULATORS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY FIX GOOD FAITH MISTAKES WILL HELP ENSURE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT THESE RULES FINALLY AND DESIGNING ROLES WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT TYPE OF EXPERIENCE WE WANT KIDS TO HAVE ONLINE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING WE WANT A SAFE AGE APPROPRIATE EXPERIENCE THE MODERN INTERNET FOR ALL THE HARMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS STILL AMERICAL IS A MARVEL OF HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT KNOWLEDGE AND SOMETHING WE DON'T WANT TO COMPLETELY SHUT CHILDREN OUT FROM PARTICULARLY OUR TEENS YOU CAN ONLY LEGISLATE SO FAR BEFORE THE END RESULTS ARE SWIMMING KIDS AND TEENS ACCESS THE OPEN FREE INTERNET AS NOTED BY EARLIER PANELISTS KIDS AND TEENS INTERACT SOCIALLY ONLINE THEY LEARN AND SUBMIT THEIR HOMEWORK ONLINE THEY CREATE ART MUSIC AND LITERATURE ONLINE AND THEY CONNECT WITH THE WIDER WORLD ACROSS BORDERS CULTURES AND LANGUAGES ALL ONLINE IN OUR PURSUIT TO PROTECT KIDS WHICH WE ALL AGREE WE NEED TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR THEM WE SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE TREMENDOUS BENEFITS OF THE INTERNET THAT THE INTERNET STILL HOLDS AND ITS IMMENSE POWER TO TEACH PROVIDE COMMUNITY AND INSPIRE CHILDREN AND TEENS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OFTEN I WANT TO I APPRECIATE YOU FOR MAKING THE TIME TO TESTIFY TODAY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE INDUSTRY AT THE TABLE WHEN WE ARE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND TO HEAR THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE CREATING SO MUCH OF THIS CONTENT THAT'S WHY AND AND THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SPECIAL OBLIGATION IN A SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO -- TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY AND HELP DRIVE THIS CONVERSATION IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION RIGHT NOW MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME OUR FINAL WITNESS DR HANY FARID HE IS A PROFESSOR AT THE BEST UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD UC BERKELEY AT THE SCHOOL THERE SEEMS TO BE CONSENSUS ON THAT AT THE SCHOOL OF -- ELECTORAL ENGINEERING COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THE SCHOOL OF INFORMATION -- AND IT'S THE BEST UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD SINCE SHE REPRESENTS THAT HIS EXPERTISE ON DIGITAL IMAGE FORENSICS -- AND OFTEN CONSULTED TO WEIGH IN ON A AYE SYNTHESIZE CONTENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FASTER WE APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE WITH US THANKS I I MAY NOT BE APPARENT ESPECIALLY SUMMIT BERKELEY SO I HAVE THAT GOING FOR ME MISTER CHAIRMAN JERRY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE ARE WE CAN'T PRETEND THAT THE INTERNET AND MORE GENERALLY TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT HAD A PHENOMENALLY POSITIVE IMPACT ON SOME ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES OUR SOCIETIES AND OUR ECONOMIES WE ALSO CAN'T PRETEND AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE INTERNET HAS NOT HAD LEAD TO REAL HARM IN THE FORM OF CHILD EXPLOITATION TERRORISM THE SALE OF ILLEGAL AND DEADLY DRUGS SMALL TO LARGE SCALE FRAUD INVASIONS OF OUR PRIVACY IN THE SPREADING OF DEADLY AND DANGEROUS DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS DESIGNED TO SOW CIVIL UNREST AND DISRUPT THE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS IN PARTS AND YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS BEFORE I'M AND I'M I'M GONNA REEMPHASIZE IT THIS IS BECAUSE SOME OF THE LARGEST TITANS OF THE TECH SECTOR THE FACEBOOKS TWITTERS THE YOU TUBES IN THE TECH TALKS ARE BASED ON AN AD DRIVEN BUSINESS IT IS SAID THAT IF THE PRODUCT IS FREE THEN YOU ARE NOT THE CUSTOMER YOU'RE THE PRODUCT REVENUE SOCIAL MEDIA'S AD DRIVEN MODEL IS MAXIMIZED BY MAXIMIZING USER ENGAGEMENT WHICH MEANS THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PRIVACY AND SECURITY TAKE A BACKSEAT IN THE NAME OF ENGAGEMENT BASED METRICS IN SOME CASES WE BEEN BENEFICIARIES OF THIS BUSINESS MODEL IN TERMS OF ENTERTAINING INSPIRING AND ENGAGING CONTENT OUR FINGER TO FINGER TIPS CROCHETING FOR EXAMPLE OPERATE OTHER CASES WE'VE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF THIS BUSINESS MODEL IN TERMS OF INVASIONS OF OUR PRIVACY AND REAL MEASURABLE WORLD HARMS THE BILL BESIDE NO BY THE WAY I'VE BEEN MENTIONING ONLINE AND OFFLINE IN REAL WORLD AND I JUST WANT EMPHASIZES THAT IT'S BEEN THIS TENDENCY TO TALK ABOUT THE INTERNET LIKE IT'S LAS VEGAS WHAT HAPPENS ON THE INTERNET STAYS ON THE INTERNET AND IT'S IT'S NOT TRUE I'M WITH THE BLUE LIBERATED THE LINE BETWEEN THE ONLINE AND THE OFFLINE WORLD AND WHAT HAPPENS ON THE INTERNET HAS REAL WORLD IMPLICATIONS AND WE HAVE TO STOP MAKING THIS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW THAT IT'S JUST THE INTERNET WE HAVE TO THEREFORE THINK ABOUT TODAY'S ONLINE SAFETY THE SAME WAY WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT YESTERDAY'S OFFLINE SAFETY IN THE FIRST PANEL YOU ASKED ABOUT THE RIGHT AND ALLERGY AND I THINK THE CAR INDUSTRY'S EXACTLY THE RIGHT ANALOGY HERE WHILE REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN AGREE ON WHAT IF ANY SAFEGUARDS SHOULD BE PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT CONSENTING ADULTS MY MIND HARMS MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE ALSO AGREED THAT SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO CHILDREN FROM THE GLOBAL YEARLY DISTRIBUTION OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF PIECES OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL WHERE THE AVERAGE AGE OF A CHILD IS EIGHT YEARS OLD DOWN TO NOW A NEW CATEGORY CALLED PREVERBAL TO CHILD GROOMING SEXTORTION SCREEN TIME ADDICTION AGE INAPPROPRIATE ADVERTISING UNHEALTHY BODY IMAGES WE MUST WE MUST THINK MORE CAREFULLY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE POWERFUL TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF CHILDREN IN EVERY WAKING MOMENT OF THEIR YOUNG LIVES THERE ARE PRACTICAL MEASURED IN REASONABLE SAFEGUARDS THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT CHILDREN ONLINE WE SHOULD FOR EXAMPLE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISRUPT THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL I WAS FOR EXAMPLE PART OF THE TEAM THAT DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED PHOTO DNA IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT I TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOW USED WORLDWIDE TO FIND AND REMOVE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED IMAGES OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE DESPITE THE WIDE ADOPTION SUCCESS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR OVER A DECADE AND DESPITE CLAIMS FROM THE PRIVACY SECTOR THAT WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY THE INTERNET DESPITE THE FACT THAT VIDEOS TODAY NOT IMAGES ARE NOW THE DOMINANT FORM OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IMAGERY THE TECH INDUSTRY HAS STILL IS STILL IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO NOT ADOPTED UNIVERSAL VIDEO STANDARD TO REMOVE KNOWN CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL WE SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT PREDATORS ARE NOT ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH CHILDREN -- ONLINE ONLINE GAMING PLATFORMS FOR EXAMPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A SERIOUS PRODUCT OR PROBLEM IN WHICH YOUNG CHILDREN ARE BEING GROOMED AND SUCH STARTED AN ONLINE GAMES WHERE THE PREDATORS GO THEY GO WITH THE CHILDREN ARE IN THE CHILDREN AROUND THE GAMING PLATFORM IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO DRAW THAT CONNECTION IT WASN'T UNTIL JUST A FEW YEARS AGO HOWEVER THAT A MICROSOFT LED TEAM THAT I WAS PART OF BUILT A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM TO DETECT GROOMING PATTERNS ON ONLINE GAMING THIS TECHNOLOGY HOWEVER IS STILL NOT BEING FULLY SUPPORTED DEVELOPED OR DEPLOYED BY THE INDUSTRY WE SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN DON'T ACCESS AGE INAPPROPRIATE ONLINE SERVICES YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT AND LET'S TALK SOME MORE ABOUT AGE APPROPRIATENESS THE BASIC APPROACH TODAY TO AGE VERIFICATION WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE INDUSTRY STANDARD IS TO SIMPLY ASK THE USER TO VERIFY THEIR AGE BY CLICKING THE BOX OR ENTERING THEIR BIRTH DATE LET'S PLEASE NOT PRETEND THAT THIS IS IN ANY WAY EFFECTIVE DESPITE THIS ABSURDLY LOW INDUSTRY STANDARD THERE ARE OTHER APPROACHES TO AGE VERIFICATION INCLUDING A USER'S NAME ADDRESS AND DATE OF BIRTH CAN BE COMPARED AGAINST ELECTORAL ROLLS GOVERNMENT DATABASES OR PRIVATE SECTOR DATABASES AS IS COMPLETELY CALM IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR GOVERNMENT ISSUED DOCUMENTS CAN BE PHOTOGRAPHED ALONG WITH THE DOCUMENT HOLDER TO VERIFY IDENTITY AND AGE I JUST DID THIS THE OTHER DAY FOR GOOGLE I I TO MAKE A CHANGE ON THAT THE PANELISTS ASSOCIATE WITH MY NAME IN A GOOGLE SEARCH AND I TO PROVE MY IDENTITY TOOK A SELFIE WITH THE US LICENSE SIGNED UP TO GOOGLE THAT'S HOW THEY KNEW WHO I WAS WE NOT DO THIS IT'S NOT THERE'S NOTHING YOU HEAR ON A AYE BASED FACIAL ANALYSIS CAN DETERMINE WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY IF A USER IS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN I AM A USER'S AGE CAN BE VERIFIED AT THE TIME A MOBILE DEVICES PURCHASED AT WHICH POINT THE PHONE ITSELF CAN ARE SECURELY VERIFIED ANY APPS OR SERVICES ARE AGE APPROPRIATE I LIKE BY THE WAY WHEN THE INDUSTRY TELLS US THAT THEY DON'T LIKE TO DO AGE APPROPRIATE AT AGE VERIFICATION BECAUSE THE CONCERNS OF PRIVACY ON THEY SEEM TO FORGET THAT THE ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL IS B. AS PROMISED I'M VACUUM UP EVERY MORSEL OF PERSONAL DATA AND TELLING ADVERTISERS THAT THEY HAVE THESE PHENOMENALLY PRECISE -- PROFILES ABADEH SO THAT THEY CAN TARGET ADVERTISE YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS YOU CAN'T BECOME A TRILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY BY BOBBING OUR PRIVACY AND THEN WHEN WE ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT CHILDREN I MIGHT SAY WELL WE DON'T WANT TO VIOLATE PEOPLE'S PRIVACY YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS BEYOND THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES -- THAT I'VE ENUMERATED AND MORE GENERALLY WE CAN AND WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT ONLINE PRODUCTS LIKE OFFLINE PRODUCTS ARE BY DESIGN SAFE FOR CHILDREN IN TERMS OF THEIR MENTAL EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL SAFETY THE FUNDAMENTAL IMITATION HERE IS NOT TECHNICAL IN NATURE THIS IS NOT TO SAY THE SOLUTIONS WILL BE EASY OR THAT THEY WILL COME WITHOUT SOME COMPROMISES WE SHOULD HOWEVER HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION OF THE RISK TO CHILDREN POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS IN THE COST OF THE SOLUTIONS AND FIND A PROPER COMPROMISE TO KEEP CHILDREN SAFE WHILE ENSURING A VIBRANT INTERNET THE BENEFITS ENVISIONED SOCIETY I ALSO LIKE BY THE WAY WHEN COMPANIES TELL US THAT THEY DON'T LIKE REGULATION FORGET THAT THE REASON WE HAVE GOOGLE IS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPPED IN AND SLACK MICROSOFT AROUND FOR USING THEIR MARKET DOMINANCE TO STIFLE INNOVATION REGULATION CAN HELP CREATE A MORE HEALTHY ARMIDE ECOSYSTEM SO COMPETITORS CAN MAKE BETTER PRODUCTS I LOOK FOR TO TALKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT AND PRESSING ISSUES THANK YOU GO BEARS WHERE IS THANK YOU AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT DOCTOR FREED AT THIS POINT I WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ASSEMBLY WOMAN WAKES THANK YOU CHECK THE REAL GOOD TO SEE YOU AS WELL BOERNER HORVATH AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR -- PULLING THIS TOGETHER AND I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE -- I'VE RUN SOME BILLS IN THE SPACE AND DOING A BILL -- WITH MILADY WITH THEM SOON WE'RE CUNNINGHAM ASK ALL OF YOU AND I'M CURIOUS IF WE GET THE SAME RESPONSE OR NOT -- YOU KNOW BARONESS YOU'D SAID THAT OPTIMIZING FOR CHILDREN DEPENDS CHIEFLY ON THE WILLINGNESS OF THE COMPANY'S TOP LEADERSHIP TO SAY YES TO THAT AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY PUT FORTH REGULATIONS IN THE U. K. THAT ARE REQUIRING THOSE CHANGES AND I KNOW YOU SAID SOME EFFECTIVE THAT YOU KNOW WORKING WITH ENGINEERS ARE NATURAL PROBLEM SOLVERS WHICH I DON'T DOUBT BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN I THINK THAT LEADERSHIP SAYING YES RIGHT THERE HAS TO BE A WILLINGNESS AND LEADERSHIP WITH THESE COMPANIES AND I THINK THERE'S AN INHERENT TENSION HERE OF THE COMPANIES MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY HAVE MORE EYEBALLS ON THEIR PRODUCT MORE EYEBALLS ON THE PRODUCT ARE THINGS THAT ENCOURAGE MORE TIME ONLINE RIGHT WHICH IS THIS TENSION THAT THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU TRIED TO DISCUSS HERE RIGHT -- ARE THE THAT YOU OUTLINED SO IN YOUR EXPERIENCE ARE THESE COMPANIES WILLING TO SAY YES AND WERE THERE ANY CHALLENGES WITH THAT AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION TO THE OTHER TWO AS WELL -- WHO HAVE REPRESENT COMPANIES AND I'VE WORKED WITH COMPANIES IS THERE A LEADERSHIP TO TACKLE THIS AND CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME TANGIBLE EXAMPLES OF IF YES OR NO I'M WELL IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK THAT THE AND MAYBE I CAN POINT TO SOME RESEARCH THAT WE DID LAST YEAR AND WE LOOKED AT COMPANIES OWN DECLARATIONS OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THAT TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHAT WHAT THEY DOING AND WHEN WE LINE THEM UP THEY WERE DOING PRIVACY TO A GREAT DEGREE BECAUSE BASS LAW AND THEY WERE DOING HUMAN SLAVERY GLASS AND THEY'RE DOING IT GOES EVEN LESS AND THAT YOU'RE NOT AND IT WENT DOWN AND DOWN AND SO THE ANSWER IS WHEN THEY ARE ASKED BY SOCIETY BY LAWMAKERS TO PUT IT AT THE TOP OF THE IN TRAY THAN THEY DO YEAH WHEN THE REQUIRED WHEN IT'S REQUIRED SO I DON'T DOUBT THAT ANYBODY INSIDE THOSE COMPANIES WOULD LIKE TO MAKE BACKUP THAT SERVICES BUT OF THE CHILDREN BUT IN THE COMPETING TO MONTHS OF A BUSINESS WHAT GETS TO THE TOP OF THE AND TRY IS WATCHES WITH QUIET YEAH SHAREHOLDER VALUE LAW THOSE OF THE TWO THINGS SO I WOULD LIKE SOME LOSS OF EIGHT CAN SAY YES IN THE WAY THAT THEY WISH TO I THINK IT'S A MIXED BAG -- SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME ENGINEERS WHO ARE NATURAL PROBLEM SOLVERS AND THEY WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THEIR TOLD SOLVE I THINK THERE ARE OTHER A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN SILICON VALLEY THOUGH THAT ARE SORT OF FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNET IS THE INTERNET -- THE GOOD THE BAD THE UGLY AND IT'S NOT OUR FAULT -- I DISAGREE WITH THAT CRAVING WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD -- I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THERE IS INTENSE PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODEL THAT BUSINESS MODEL IS AN ATTENTION GRABBING AD DELIVERY BUSINESS MODEL AND THE REASON FOR THAT BY THE WAY IS BECAUSE TWENTY YEARS AGO NOBODY THOUGHT WE CAN MAKE MONEY ON THE INTERNET NOBODY ENVISIONED THAT WE BE PUTTING OUR CREDIT CARD IN BUYING SUBSCRIPTIONS IN BUYING ABSENT THAT COMFORT THAT WE NOW HAVE AND SO THE ONLY BUSINESS MODEL WE COULD CONCEIVE BOB WAS THE ATTENTION GRABBING EIGHT ENGAGEMENT METRIC OF DELIVERING ADS I WOULD ARGUE TODAY THAT LANDSCAPE LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT AND THAT MAYBE WE NEED BETTER BUSINESS MODELS BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE HAVE FIVE TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES THEIR STARTLING INNOVATION IN THE SPACE ARM NOW ON THIS AND THE C.

MOVIE LIKE THAT STUFF RIGHT AND WORSE -- YOU COULD OKAY YOU WANT ON THIS THE SAP YOU NEED A PARENT PICTURE DRIVER'S LICENSE PARENTS AND SAYS OKAY NOW YOU CAN DOLLAR I MEAN THAT SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION TO VERIFYING THAT THE KID HAS PARENTAL CONSENT AND IS OF THE APPROPRIATE AGE I MEAN THIS IN MY HOUSEHOLD -- WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST PRICE SIX MONTHS -- THIS MY INTEREST IN THIS THING STARTED YEARS AGO WHEN MY DAUGHTER WHO IS LIKE TEN OR ELEVEN AT THE TIME WAS PLAYING ANIMAL JAM WHICH YOU THINK ABOUT AN INNOCUOUS SOUNDING FREAKING ONLINE GAME ANIMAL JANET MY WIFE AND I DISCOVERED THAT SOME CHILD PREDATOR WAS MAKING SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS TO HER WHILE SHE'S PLAN ANIMAL JAM ANIMAL JAM WAS GONE FROM OUR HOUSEHOLD TEN MILLISECOND SAY SURE YOU UP WE'VE HAD TWO HUNDRED BUCKS OF THE XBOX VIDEO GAME CHARGES ON MY WIFE'S CREDIT CARD FOR MY SON'S BUYING FIFA PLAYER CARD PACKS RIGHT WE'VE HAD A BODY IMAGE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSED AT LENGTH WITH ONE OF OUR TEEN TEEN DAUGHTERS -- YOU KNOW I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT THAT'S JUST IN OUR ONE HOUSEHOLD OKAY SO BACK TO AGE VERIFICATION I FIND IT BORDERING ON DISINGENUOUS THAT THESE TECH COMPANIES SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR THE CAPABILITY TO VERIFY THAT THE USERS ON OUR PLATFORM ARE EITHER OF THE APPROPRIATE AGE OF CONSENT IN EVERYWHERE ACROSS LAW WHICH IS EIGHTEEN IN CALIFORNIA OR BE THEIR PARENTS DID IN FACT CONSENT TO THE USE OF THE PRODUCT SO I'D LIKE TO GET THE LOTS ON THAT AND MAYBE THERE'S WAYS THAT I WAS UNABLE TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS -- I'D LIKE INPUT FROM INDUSTRY AS WELL AND YOU'RE JUST THAT FEEL FREE TO CONTACT SURE AND I CAN TAKE A FIRST AND LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I WAS CLEAR IN MY IN MY TALKING POINTS I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN'T DO BETTER WHAT I'M SAYING THE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE ARE TRADE OFFS AND THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH DIFFERENT CHOICES TO ERROR AGE VERIFY LAWS IN THE STATE CPRE WE ARE EXPECTING YOU REGULATIONS OUT THIS YEAR THAT MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO COMPANIES THAT WE ARE TO COLLECT IF WE ARE COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION WHERE TO USE IT FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS COLLECTED AND VERY LITTLE ELSE AND WE'VE GOT TO DISCLOSE THAT AND THAT THERE ARE VERY -- STRINGENT FOR -- INFORMATION THAT IS ACCESSED -- IN CASE OF A BREACH INCLUDING SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR OTHER GOVERNMENT ID TALKING ABOUT CURRENT TECHNOLOGY I THINK THAT'S THE TRADE OFF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS DO WE WANT TO USE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF OF AGE VERIFYING ANY AGE GATING THAT'S A CHOICE I THINK FOR THIS BODY BUT THERE ARE STRONG INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT WE HAVE AND MINIMIZE THE USES FOR WHICH AND I THINK I MENTIONED IN MY MY TALKING POINTS I THINK THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE COLLECTIVELY AS AN INDUSTRY UNITING SOME OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM PROVIDERS THE INTERNET BROWSERS THE END USER AND USER'S WEBSITES APPLICATIONS -- TO REACH OF A BETTER MORE PRIVACY PROTECTIVE SOLUTION -- BUT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE THOSE THOSE TRADE OFFS AND AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND I'M SIMPLY SAYING THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH THAT I I I HEAR THAT THE THE THE THE THING I FIND FUNNY IS I MEAN MAYBE WE JUST SEVEN CREATED THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE TO DO IT YET BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I MEAN IT TWO GENERATIONS AGO ENGINEERS THAT WORKED AT THESE COMPANIES WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNING ROCKETS TO PUT MAN ON THE MOON I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND NOW THESE ARE SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET I MEAN AND AND SO IS IT IS IT THE LACK OF INCENTIVE BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T SEE WHERE THE INCENTIVE IS I MEAN IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF SAYS YOU HAVE TO DO IT YOU GOTTEN SENT TO DO IT IF THERE'S NO LAW IT SEEMS LIKE THE INCENTIVES WHICH IS HOW WE SEE IN THIS INDUSTRY GROW WHICH IT WHICH IS IN THE DATA HARVESTING AND DATA MINING FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES AND THAT'S BEEN AN IMMENSELY PROFITABLE HISTORICALLY UNPRECEDENTED WE PROP PROFITABLE RIGHT SO THERE IT'S CERTAINLY I WOULD SEE SEEM TO THINK THERE'S A THERE'S AN INCENTIVE IN BALANCE RIGHT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S CAPITALISM TO AGREE AND I GOT NO PROBLEM PEOPLE MAKE A BUCK BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE HAVE WE NOT NUDGED YOU ENOUGH IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER HAVE WE NOT INSISTED ON THE COLLABORATION OF WE NOT ME WHAT WHERE WE WERE WE LACKING HERE OKAY SO COUPLE OF THINGS I DON'T THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS FOR THE COMPANIES TO SAY THEY CAN'T DO IT I THINK IT'S JUST A LIE -- I KNOW I KNOW I'M NOT POLITE IS THERE IS A LACK OF AND IT'S WORSE THAN THAT THERE'S NOT A LACK OF AN INCENTIVE IT NOT ONLY IS THERE NO LAW SAYING YOU HAVE TO DO IT THERE'S NO LIABILITY THESE COMPANIES HAVE SECTION TWO THIRTY THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT WHICH IS BASICALLY EVERYTHING GETS KICKED BEFORE THE JUDGE EVEN SEES ANYTHING SO THERE THERE ISN'T EVEN A LIABILITY THE BACK AND I'M LIKE AUTOMOBILES RIGHT YOU BUILD A CRAPPY CAR AND IT CRASHES AND I DIE IN IT YOU'RE GONNA GET SUED RIGHT YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THE PRODUCTS OF THERE'S NO LIABILITY AT ONE AND THERE'S NO LAWS AT THE OTHER END I'M TO THE POINT ABOUT THAT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GET STOLEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO RETAIN THIS INFORMATION YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD ONTO IT THAT THAT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT THIS ARGUMENT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE RIGHT VERIFIED MENTALLY THE THE THE DATA OR AT LEAST HARD ENCRYPTED AT THE BACK AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO ENCRYPTION AREN'T SO AT THAT ARGUMENT DOESN'T REALLY WORK I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S A COMPLETE RED HERRING TO SAY WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO INCENTIVE AND BECAUSE IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS AND WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS BAD FOR BUSINESS RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO CREATE FRICTION THE REASON WHY SOCIAL MEDIA WORKS SO WELL IS BECAUSE IT'S FRICTIONLESS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT FRICTION IS GOOD FRICTION IN THE CRYPTO WORLD IS GOOD BECAUSE IT HELPS PREVENT FRAUD NOT ENOUGH THIS TO A LOT OF FRAUD IN IT BUT THE REASON WE PUT FRICTION IN SYSTEMS IS TO SLOW DOWN THE BAD ACTORS RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SIGN OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S AN EYEBALL AND THAT'S AN AD AND THAT'S MONEY THAT WE PUT FRICTION IN THAT SYSTEM TO OKAY I GOT MY LICENSE AND TAKE A PICTURE OF A BLIND I'M WILLING TO DO THAT TO GET MY CREDIT CARD IF YOU GET A CRYPTO ACCOUNT BUT MAYBE I'M GONNA LOSE TWENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO SIGNED UP FOR AN ACCOUNT THAT'S ANNOYING RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THE COLLABORATION HERE HAS TO BE NOT WE CAN'T DO IT WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT STEPPING IN AND BEATING EVERYBODY OVER THE HEAD WITH THE CLUB ALTHOUGH I WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT I'M IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE REALIGN THE INCENTIVES AND HOW DO WE MAKE THIS IS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU BEEN MENTIONING SEVERAL TIMES OPERATING SYSTEMS BROWSERS THE MOBILE DEVICES CAN BE CENTRALIZED AT NIGHT IS BASICALLY TO PHONE MAKERS IN THE WORLD ANDROID AND APPLE RIGHT SO WHAT WE CENTRALIZED WITH THAT MAKE IT TO EVERY APP COULD ACCESS WITH MY AGES SO THAT WE CAN VERIFY ON THE PROJECT CAN ACCESS THIS DOESN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS BY THE WAY WE STOP LAPTOPS AND DESKTOPS AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT DEVICES WITH THE THINK ABOUT PEOPLE TO SWITCH ACCOUNTS BUT SO I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK MORE CREATIVELY AND WE HAVE TO STOP PRETENDING THAT THERE ISN'T A WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM OR THAT IT SOMEHOW IS GOING TO PUT EVERYBODY AT RISK I THINK IT'S SIMPLY UNTRUE I THINK I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE WORD DISINGENUOUS I I I THINK THAT -- I THINK THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE ONE IS WHETHER YOU CAN AND ACTUALLY THAT'S A GREAT MANY WAYS OF DOING IT AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CENTRALIZED IT CAN BE IT'S AN OPERATING SYSTEM IT CAN BE A TOKEN AND IT CAN BE A NUMBER YOU KNOW OF VOICE IT CAN BE A FACE AND THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS AND IN LOOKING AT ONE OF THOSE WAYS THE BIT THAT IS MISSING IS THE GOVERNMENT SPIT THE BIT THAT WOULD ENSURE USE OF PRIVACY ENSURE THAT SECURITY AND ENSURE THAT EFFICACY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE BILL THAT IS A A LINE IF YOU LIKE IS TO SAY IT'S NOT HAPPENING YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GETS SHED WHEN YOU USE YOUR LOG IN FROM ONE COMPANY TO THE NEXT IT'S YOUR AGE RANGE YEAH IT IS CONSTANTLY SHED YOUR AGE ALL OF OUR AGE INCLUDING KIDS SO I THINK I THINK THE THAT'S ONE BIT BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT WHY IS THIS SUCH A LOT OF RESISTANCE BECAUSE THE PURPOSE LIMITATION ALSO DOES IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE GONNA PUT THIS LIMITATION AND IN YOUR LOCAL AND THEN SAID THAT IT DOESN'T IT BUT IT DOESN'T ACCRUE TO AGE INSURANCE IT DOES RIGHT SO WHY IS THERE SO MUCH RESISTANCE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT HAPPENS ONCE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS A CHILD RIGHT SO THE CHILDREN ARE BEING TARGETED FOR ADVERTISING AND IN FACT I WOULD SAY THAT COMPANIES HAVE DONE QUITE A GOOD JOB OF MAKING AT AGE AT ADVERTISING AGE APPROPRIATE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IT'S A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN IT WAS WHEN I STARTED THIS CONVERSATION HOWEVER THOSE SAME CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS RECEIVING AGE APPROPRIATE ADVERTISING ARE BEING SENT CENTCOM PURSUE SITE MESSAGES AND SO ON BECAUSE THE COMPANIES ARE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AGE OUTSIDE OF THE ADVERTISING SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO REALLY SEPARATE AT THESE TWO ISSUES WHAT IS THE FEASIBILITY TOTALLY TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY YOU KNOW WHY DON'T I WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS THE JOB OF LAWMAKERS THAT IS THE INCENTIVE PICKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GERMAN YES THANK YOU I'M I LIKE TO ASK MR HOFFMAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WITH CCPA MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF YOU COLLECT DATA FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSE ECONOMY ONLY USE FOR THAT PURPOSE IF YOU COLLECT DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF AGE VERIFICATION THAT I CAN ONLY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE SO THEN YOU HAVE THE AGE VERIFICATION AND I THINK I WOULD ENCOURAGE TECHNICAL AND ALL THE TECH COMPANIES TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION FOR THIS IT IS NOT OKAY THE SUMMIT IS AND IS THEIR AGE THAT'S LIKE GIVING SOMEBODY A FREE PASS OF THE FAKE ID IN THE EIGHTIES LIKE THAT'S INSANE WE ARE FAR BEYOND THAT AND THE TECHNOLOGIES WE ON THAT SIDE REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO INSTEAD OF SAYING WHY THIS DOESN'T WORK TO COME BACK TO US AND SAY THIS DOES WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE TO AGE VERIFY AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE THIRTEEN IS THE RIGHT AGE I HAVE A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SON I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT AGE AT ALL I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIRTEEN CAME FROM JORDAN PROBABLY KNOWS THAT I ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM SORRY YEAH THAT'S RIDICULOUS I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DID WHAT WE WELL THAT'S WHY ANYWAYS I'M YEAH I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO LOOK AT THE AGE LIMIT I'M I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT I'M FULLY FORMED BRAINS -- PROCESSING THE AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT HAD TO PROCESS THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT ON OUR YOUTH AND AS I SAID EARLIER IN SOME WAYS SOCIAL MEDIA ONLINE PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN A GODSEND IN SOME WAYS THEY HAVE CONNED CAUSED IRREPARABLE HARM AND THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST BUT VERIFY BUT I DO BELIEVE VERY VERY STRONGLY THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR OUR LEGAL A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENSURING THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR KIDS WE WANT PROTECT THEM THAT WE'VE EXPANDED THE ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING REGULATIONS TO GET AT HUMAN TRAFFICKERS IN REAL LIFE AND IT'S THE SAME ONLINE WHEN I DID THAT WEAPON ARE WITH MY D. A. AT HOME WHAT I LEARNED PREVENTED ME FROM EVER LETTING MY CHILDREN GO ON SOME OF THESE PLATFORMS I HAD TO HAVE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH MY THEN THIRTEEN YEAR OLD AND MY TEN YEAR OLD ABOUT HOW DO YOU VERIFY SOMEBODY'S REALLY A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FROM OAKLAND AND NOT A FORTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MAN FROM KENTUCKY SORRY MAN THANK YOU BUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS MARKETS BUT NOT EVERY PARENT HAS THE TIME AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION WE HAVE TO REMEMBER CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS SO HOW ARE YOU GETTING AT THE UNDOCUMENTED AS WELL SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT SO I CHALLENGE THE TECH COMPANIES TO COME BACK TO US WITH SOME SORT OF SOLUTION THAT'S GONNA DRESS THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BECAUSE THAT ISSUES BROUGHT UP BY THE BEARS VANNESS SORRY AND DR FRED ARE OF VERY CLEARLY I THINK IN THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PARENTS ON THIS PANEL YOU'RE A BUNCH OF PARENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN FOR WHATEVER IT TAKES SO THAT'S WHY I GUESS IT'S NOT A QUESTION I GUESS THAT'S MY STATEMENT ON THE SPELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THE VERY NICE YOU WANTED TO COMMENT ON THAT I JUST WANTED TO PICK UP ON SOMETHING THE CHAIRWOMAN SAID ABOUT AT THAT AGE RANGE I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS CONVERSATION NOT TO SEE AGE VERIFICATION AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO KICK KIDS OFF THE INTERNET IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT THEM ACCORDING TO THAT AGE AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT STUFF IT'S A LAW AND I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT THE COMPANIES HAVE DONE IN RELATION TO THE CODE'S SO IF ACTUALLY YOU WORK OUT IT'S A SEVEN YEAR OLD MAYBE YOU NEED TO GET THE PREVIOUS C. NOTICE IN THE VIDEO OR CONTENT MAYBE YOU CAN ACTUALLY OFFER A LITTLE BIT MORE HELP AS THEY TRY AND A DOWNGRADE THAT PRIVACY SETTING AND SO ON THE THE THE IDENTIFYING OF AGE ISN'T REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SAFETY WITH THE CHILD AS THEY GROW BECAUSE A FIFTY A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD OUR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DOESN'T NEED THE SAME PROTECTION THEY NEED DIFFERENT PROTECTIONS ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY M. ON H. AND AND IT SHOULD NOT BE TESTING MUST NOT BE TESTING BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN WHO COME TO HARM OF FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN RIGHT AND THEY HAVE NO PROTECTIONS THEY ARE TREATED AS IF THEY'RE ADULTS SO THIS HAS TO BE A SOPHISTICATED LOOK OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE TECH COMPANY I BELIEVE THEY CAN DO IT WE JUST HAVE TO SET THE SET THE BOX READ ONE MORE THING HERE UP I AGREE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE H. CAREFULLY AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT I'M NOT A CHILD ABOUT MENTAL YOU'VE HEARD FROM THAT EARLY ON BUT ME REMIND YOU THAT THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX FULLY DEVELOPED IN THE EARLY TO MID TWENTIES RIGHT SO THE KIDS I'M TEACHING AT UC BERKELEY ARE YOU ARE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED IN THERE THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX ON THAT MEANS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION DECISION MAKING UNDERSTANDING RISK NOT FULLY DEVELOPED UNTIL YOUR MID TWENTIES SO THAT THINK ABOUT THAT IN RELATION TO A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SIXTEEN YEAR OLD AND WE SHOULD VERY HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THAT AGES -- I GREW THE BARONESS THIRTEEN IS WAY TOO YOUNG MISTER BUMP I'M GLAD THAT YOU JUST BROUGHT THAT UP -- BECAUSE I THINK -- -- THAT THE OPPOSED EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TO USE -- YOUNG ADULTS TO -- -- BY -- ONLINE PRODUCTS AND BEHAVIOR -- WHEN IT COMES TO -- EIGHT TERRORISM A HAN A BODY IMAGE I THINK -- YOU KNOW FOR MANY YOUNG ADULTS OF THAT AGE AND -- OF SUICIDE THINK -- THIS IS A OF I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION TODAY BUT -- A BROADER ONE THAN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO -- -- -- TO GET TO IF THERE'S AN ENTIRE CONTINUUM ABOUT IT PROBABLY GOES ON BEYOND EVEN USE BUT WE JUST KNOW THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE IMPRESSIONABLE YEARS ARE AHEAD WE KNOW THAT TO A TERRORIST FOR EXAMPLE ARE FREQUENTLY GROOMED AT A YOUNG AGE AND WE SEE THE RESULTS -- AND AND HEADLINES SO I JUST I WANNA -- AND WE'RE COMING TO A CLOSE TO THE CONCLUSION OF -- OF OF THE HEARING I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED IT'S BEEN FASCINATING AND HELPFUL AND USEFUL AND -- IN MANY WAYS THAT I THINK GO BEYOND JUST THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD HERE TODAY YOU CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM I'M AND I DO WANT TO MOVE US IN A LITTLE BIT TO -- PUBLIC COMMENT YEAH JUST TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO WIN I GUESS THE ONE THING I WANTED TO SORT OF REFLECT ON AS I LISTEN ALL THIS AND MAYBE IF ANY OF THE PANELISTS ONE RESPOND -- YES YOU KNOW IT TO ME IT'S SORT OF THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE IS A FUNDAMENTAL TENSION BETWEEN PROFIT MOTIVATION AND WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND MENTAL WELL BEING OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND AND THAT'S OKAY RIGHT I MEAN THE COMPANIES HAVE A MANDATE IN THEIR MANDATE IS TO TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS FOR SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT MANDATE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT THAT IS TO PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT -- IN THE BROADER INTERESTS OF SOCIETY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF GROUPS THAT ARE VULNERABLE AND THERE'S AN ESPECIALLY STRONG PUBLIC POLICY CASE TO PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES ME IS THAT SOME OF THESE CHOICES ARE CLEAR TRADE OFFS BETWEEN THE PROFIT MOTIVATION FOR THE COMPANIES AND SAFETY AND HEALTH FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT ALSO LISTENING SOME OF THIS IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT SOME OF THOSE THINGS REQUIRE THE COMPANIES TO SACRIFICE PROFITS I WAS LISTENING TO THE BARONESS YOU KNOW TURNING OFF THE FEATURE WHERE IN ADULTS CAN'T CONTACT A CHILD THAT THEY'RE NOT FRIENDS WITH ON INSTAGRAM I HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT WOULD REALLY DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE PROFIT OF THAT COMPANY BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY LONG WAY FROM CREEPING CREEPY PEOPLE AWAY FROM MY KIDS RIGHT I MEAN THAT THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE A TRADE OFF IT'S A PRETTY EASY ONE TO MAKE AND I ALSO WONDER AT THE SAME TIME WHETHER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE COMPANIES ARE RESISTANT TO OR AND INDEED ACTUALLY GOING TO IMPACT THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE WAY THAT THEY DO THAT I'M THINKING OF -- A BIRD THAT THE LEGENDARY HENRY WAXMAN WHO CERTAINLY UNITED STATES HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES AND ALSO IN THIS BODY TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE WORK WORKING TO OUTLAW SMOKING IN BARS THERE'S INCREDIBLE RESISTANCE AND THEY SAID NO NO EVER COME TO A BAR IF YOU CAN'T SMOKE THERE IT TURNED OUT THAT THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE RIGHT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY BENEFITTED THEIR BUSINESSES TO DO THAT I WONDER THAT IF PARENTS YOU KNOW WITH WITH MINIMAL EFFORT FROM SOME OF THESE COMPANIES WORKING TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS SAFER -- IT WOULD REALLY BENEFIT THOSE COMPANIES AND AND PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO WANT TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN ACCESS THEM AND USE THEM FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND ALL OF THE WONDERFUL -- I THINK YOU DESCRIBED IT AS AT PHENOMENALLY POSITIVE BENEFITS THAT THEY PROVIDE RIGHT AND I THINK ABOUT GOING BACK TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE REQUIRING A COMPANY TO HAVE A CAR SEAT FOR AN INFANT THAT DOESN'T IMPACT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN SELL CARS THAT DOESN'T IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF THOSE COMPANIES SO I JUST WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE YOU KNOW COULD COMMENT ON THAT CERTAINLY THERE ARE GONNA BE CASES WHERE THAT PROFIT MOTIVATION IS INTENTION WITH DOING WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF YOUNG PEOPLE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF LOW HANGING FRUIT HERE WHERE WE COULD MAKE SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE AND STILL ALLOW FOR INNOVATION CREATIVITY AND ALL OF THE WONDERFUL BENEFITS OF THESE THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION I THINK THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IS ARE WE PAYING A PRICE FOR THEM NOT DOING IT AND I THINK IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR HEALTH SYSTEM IN SONG WITHOUT PAYING A PRICE YOU KNOW WHAT PAYING A SOCIAL PRICE BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY PAYING OUT A COST PRICE AT BAKER BECAUSE HOMES COSTS I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE ALSO INTERESTING WHICH IS IF YOU CANNOT MAKE THE PRODUCTS SAFE YEAH BUT YOU'VE GOT A CLUTCH ON THE MARKET THAT'S MARKET FABIA BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF INNOVATORS OUT THERE YOU KNOW AND START UPS WOULD LIKE TO COME INTO THIS SPACE BUT THEY CALMED BECAUSE ACTUALLY IF YOU COME TO TREAT PEOPLE WELL AND MAKE A PROFIT THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR A SOUL AND THEN FINALLY I THINK THERE IS A QUESTION OF SUSTAINABILITY AND I'M NOT AND IT WAS QUITE
