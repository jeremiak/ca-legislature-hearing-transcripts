THIS IS NOT A NEW INVESTMENT THIS FISCAL YEAR BUT IS ON GOING FROM THAT. FROM THE CURRENT YEAR- IT'S A TEN MILLION DOLLARS. KILEY PROGRAM FOR GRANT MAKING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO LESSEN RELIANCE ONLINE FORSMAN AGENCIES AS FIRST RESPONDERS IN CRISIS SITUATIONS. CDSS HAS BEEN IN CONSULTATION WITH A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS.

OR CONSULTANTS- TO ENGAGE IN SPECIALIST HE OF THE- MANDATED STATE WORK. AND AS WELL AS ITS VALUE. ANTI IS. FOR THE GRANT PILOT PROGRAMS- THAT ARE S. I.

WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING AS A SAID INFORMALLY AND IN CONSULTATION WITH THE STAKEHOLDER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION PROCESS AT FOUR MEMBERS OF THE FORMAL STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUP- WHICH WE WILL BE PUBLICIZING IN THE COMING WEEKS AND WE HOPE TO. LAUNCH THE AT THE STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUPS OPERATIONS ALSO IN THE SPRING OF THIS YEAR- WE ANTICIPATE ISSUING A REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS FOR PILOT PROJECTS IN THE FALL OF THIS YEAR AND EXPECT TO HAVE A WORDS ISSUED BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD- AGAIN THIS IS A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PILOT PROGRAM- AND- WE EXPECT THE FUNDS TO BE AWARDED. AT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. THAT'S THE STATUS CURRENTLY OF THE CRISIS ACT- I WILL MOVE INTO UPDATES ON THAT HEAT INCIDENTS PROGRAM- AND AGAIN HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS. IF THERE ARE ANY- THE HATE INCIDENTS SURVIVOR AND PREVENT SERVE PRO. IS OF A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OVER THREE YEARS TO. SUPPORT COMMUNITY BASED BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PROVIDING SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF HATE INCIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND TO ENGAGE IN PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. PROGRAM IS BEING ADMINISTERED BY CDSS IN CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSION ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICAN AFFAIRS- CDSS AND THE COMMISSION JOINTLY HELD A SERIES OF LISTENING SESSIONS IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHERE WE HAD PARTICIPATION FROM OVER A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS AND STAKEHOLDERS AT PROVIDING INPUT ON. THE NEEDS GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AREA OF ANTI HEAT SERVICES AND PREVENTION. THERE WERE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN AREAS OF CULTURALLY COMPETENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LEGAL SERVICES RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND ALTERNATIVES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS USE DEVELOPMENT SENIOR SAFETY AND A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS AND SO WITH THAT INFORMATION I GATHER FROM THOSE LISTENING SESSIONS IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CDSS ISSUED AN RSA FOR THE STOP THE HEAT PROGRAM.

SO WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL MOVE ST TO ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS POSED IN THE AGENDA THAT'S FINE. THE FIRST WAS REGARDS TO THE ONE MALE. HOW THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION. AS YOU KNOW LAST SUMMER THE BUDGET ACT TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALLOCATED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES FUNDING PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES IMMIGRATION SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. SINCE THEN CDSS WITH AN ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND IMMIGRATION SERVICES GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CREATE NEW IMMIGRATION BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN GROUPS. DURING THE FALL OF LAST YEAR CONGRESS WAS CONSIDERING SEVERAL LARGE PIECES OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION- THAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT SOME FORM OF IMMIGRATION REFORM OR POTENTIAL PATHWAYS TO LEGAL LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENCY OR CITIZENSHIP FOR CERTAIN GROUPS- THIS TYPE OF EXPANSION OF BENEFITS WOULD REQUIRE A QUICK EXPANSION OF IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES CAPACITY. TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR SUPPORT IN APPLYING FOR ANY BENEFIT. IN OUR BEST GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDING THE SMALL NUMBER OF IMMIGRATION LAWYERS IN CALIFORNIA- WE ARE CONSIDERING USING THE APPLICATION AND FUNDING TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR CREDITED REPRESENTATIVES. WORK FOR TRAIN TO NAVIGATE IMMIGRATION LAW PROCESS NEEDS TO HELP IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE IMMIGRATION BENEFITS APPLICATION PROCESS. THE ONE TIME FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT SUPPLEMENT THREE KEY AREAS OF SERVICE OUR REGION EDUCATION LEGAL SERVICES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. CONCEPTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED WITH THE PROJECTED TIMELINE OF ANNOUNCING FUNDING AWARDS BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THIS YEAR. THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA WAS- I REQUEST YOU PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE WORK AT THE COMPANY DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTING RECENT AFGHAN ARRIVALS. LET ME BEGIN WITH SOME UPDATE AND BACKGROUND TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AROUND THE WORK THE DEPARTMENT TO SUPPORT RECENT ARRIVALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA HAS NOW RESETTLED APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND AFGHANS. AFTER NEWCOMERS OF SEVERAL PRIMARILY IN NINE COUNTIES WITH THE LARGEST NUMBERS ARRIVING IN SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO AND LAST AND THE LAST COUNT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERED WITH TWENTY FOUR LOCAL RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INITIAL RESETTLEMENT OF THESE NEWCOMERS EXPERIENCED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN THE RESETTLEMENT PROCESS INCLUDING DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF FEDERAL DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS AN EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION DOCUMENT. LIMITED RESETTLEMENT AGENCY AND COMMUNITY PARTNER CAPACITY TO PROVIDE RESETTLEMENT SERVICES. AND NO DIRECT PATHWAY TO LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENCY IS EXPECTED TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM. THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE HAS BEEN ACCESSING AFFORDABL HOUSING. AT THE DEPARTMENT WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY WORKING TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. WITH REGARDS TO THE FEDERAL DOCUMENTATION CHALLENGE CDSS IS. ELEVATING THE DIFFICULTIES CREATED BY THE LACK OF DOCUMENTATION TO OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AT THE U. S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES AND THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO FIND WORKAROUNDS AND STREAMLINE ACCESS TO PUBLIC BENEFITS. THE DRESS THE CHALLENGES OF LIMITED AGENCY IN COMMUNITY PARTNER CAPACITY THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN COORDINATING THE ASSIGNMENT OF SHORT TERM FEDERAL STAFFING. AND SUPPORTING CONNECTIONS OF VOLUNTEER GROUPS IN ADDITION NEXT MONTH- DEPARTMENT WILL ANNOUNCE THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR STATE GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT. INCREASE SERVICES AT RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS FOR ACT ARRIVALS. TO ENSURE CONTINUED ACCESS TO CASE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES. OKAY ACCESS TO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES FOR AFGHAN NEWCOMERS WERE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM AS A PATHWAY TO LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENCY THE DEPARTMENT IS LEVERAGING THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES FUNDING PROGRAMS TO INCREASE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES. AND ALSO EXPLORING WAYS TO INCREASE PRO BONO. PRIVATE ATTORNEY INVOLVEMENT AND WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICES. PROGRESS THE HOUSING CHALLENGE AT THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN WORKING WITH THE DISASTER HOUSING CONSULTANT AND THIS MONTH WE ARE LAUNCHING A HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT WILL SUPPORT THE TRANSITION OF AFGHAN RIVALS FROM HOUSING. MANY AFGHAN INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES CURRENTLY. IN FEDERALLY OR PRIVATELY FUNDED HOTELS OR OTHER SHORT TERM HOUSING FACILITIES AS THE RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES FIND THEM LONG TERM HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY. THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES IN IDENTIFYING AVAILABLE UNITS AS WELL AS PROVIDING DIRECT RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS. CDSS WILL BE INVESTING THIRTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR AFGHAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE. THIS FUNDING AS PART OF THE FEDERAL SEVENTY NINE MILLION REFUGEE SUPPORT SERVICES THE WARD PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED TO DATE SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT AFGHAN NEWCOMERS. WE MAY STILL RECEIVE ADDITIONAL- ARE FUNDING FOR THIS POPULATION. REMAINING FUNDING MAY BE USED TO EXPAND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES INCREASE HOUSING ASSISTANCE OR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES FOR AFGHAN YOU COME. THE DEPARTMENT WILL ALSO BE AWARDING OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR ACTIVITIES THAT LEAD TO THE EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION AND EDUCATION OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AND PROVIDING ABOUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REFUGEE HEALTH PROMOTION TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF NEWCOMERS. AS I NOTED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE WORK ACT AND ARRIVALS. THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION'S RESETTLING THE MOST AFGHAN. SETTLEMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER NONPROFITS TO IDENTIFY THOSE IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND THE MECHANISMS TO MOST EFFECTIVELY STARVATION PROGRAM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO INCREASED FUNDING FOR ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS AFGHANS AND OTHER REFUGEES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH AS REFUGEE CASH ASSISTANCE. THESE FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO FLOW THROUGH COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES WHO ADMINISTER THE SAFETY NET PROGRAM. WITH ALL OUR INVESTMENTS YES THAT'S WILL CONTINUE PARTNERING WITH RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES COMMUNITY PARTNERS COUNTIES. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF AFGHAN NEWCOMERS INTO CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO STAND READY TO CONTINUE WELCOMING OTHER SEEKING. REFUGE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY LET'S GO TO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. CARSON DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME HELLO. AFTERNOON SCHEDULE SHORT WITH THE L. A. L. JUST A QUICK COMMENT REGARDING THE REQUEST FOR THE- RESOURCES FOR COMPLIANCE REVIEWS AND COMPLAINTS OBLIGATIONS- WE'VE REVIEWED THAT BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL AND HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THIS TIME- AND NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THAT AT THE MOMENT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THE FOR THE CRISIS PROGRAM IT WAS A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WE ARE GETTING READY TO STEP ABOARD TWENTY. I NEED TO BE SPENT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND SO. NEXT YEAR IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE ALLOCATION THAT WE GIVE OUT WILL BE BIGGER OR- HOW GOOD ON ALL. YOURS FREE TODAY HATE INCIDENTS PROGRAM YES I'M SORRY YES. YES SO THAT IS THE INITIAL RSA THAT WE ISSUED FOR THAT THIS YEAR IS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AT THE WE WERE ALLOCATED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CURRENT YEAR AND THEN FORTY EACH IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS- AS I SAID. IT RSA FOR THE STOP HE PROGRAM WAS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVE ANOTHER TEN MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE AND THAT WILL BE ALLOCATED FOR THE TRANSFORMATIVE BRANDS THAT I MENTIONED THAT ARE BY INVITATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROCESSES WILL WE WILL ANTICIPATE ALLOCATING THE FULL THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. THEN IN ENDING IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS WE WILL HAVE FORTY MILLION AND FORTY MILLION. TO DISTRIBUTE- AND SO THE IDEA IS VERY LIKELY TO CONTINUE. WITH RENEWALS ARE AUGMENTATIONS I AM LOOKING AT FILLING GAPS WITH ADDITIONAL- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- WHERE ADDITIONAL NEEDS ARE IDENTIFIED- SO WE DO ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AMOUNTS AND IN COMING YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU ANNA AND ALL OF THIS ALL THESE NEW PROGRAMS AND NEW ATTENTION IS- IS BEING DONE AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE NOON NEW NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM SO. I WOULD JUST THINK THAT WE JUST WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL ABOUT HOW ALL THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO INTEGRATE TOGETHER AND LOOP BACK AROUND SO WE DON'T HAVE- REDUNDANCY OR POINTING PEOPLE AND IN WRONG DIRECTIONS- ON THE ON THE ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM- WITH FUNDING MORE CREDENTIALED- IMMIGRATION- M. CALPERS IF YOU WELL. HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM ABUSE SINCE WE KNOW THAT THIS DEMOGRAPHIC OFTEN IS ABUSED MORE THAN ANY OTHER BY- PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PROVIDING ADVICE AND OFTENTIMES TAKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR FOLKS. SO AS WE'RE AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET MORE CREDENTIAL PEOPLE OUT THERE. DO WE ALSO HAVE A PAYROLL PLAN TO MAKE SURE. THOSE AND CREDENTIALED ARE NOT- USING ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO PREY UPON PEOPLE. EGGMAN THAT QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW THAT IS ONE OF THE EFFORTS OF OUR EDUCATION OUT REACH FUNDING TO REALLY GOING. TO FOR AN ACTUAL STATE LICENSE ATTORNEY AND OR UNDER CREDIT REPRESENTATIVE AND WHAT THE REPUTABLE ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN ANY GIVEN REGION- THAT YOU SHOULD BE TURNING TO HER ASSISTANCE SO A LOT OF THE EDUCATION OUTREACH WORK IS FUNDED TO DO JUST THAT RIGHT PEOPLE TO THE PLACES WHERE THEY CAN GET HIGH QUALITY REPRESENTATION AND WE KNOW ALSO THAT IN THE SPACES WE ARE NOT THE ONLY PARTNERS PHILANTHROPY IS ALSO. ENGAGING ENTITIES COMEDIAN EDUCATION OUT REACH EFFORTS OF THE PEOPLE HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION AND KNOW WHEN THERE IS AN ACTUAL BENEFIT TO APPLY FOR BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT MISINFORMATION CAN BE RAMPANT IN THE SPACE. THANK YOU CAN I GUESS JUST ON THE- THE NOTE OF OUR- AFGHANISTAN REFUGEES THAT WERE ALL FIGHTING FOR THE SAME WORK FORCE OF THE SAME HOUSING. GOING TO GET THERE OKAY THANK YOU PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION- A FEW QUESTIONS YOUR FIRST OF ALL I DO WANT TO THANK THE PART OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR YOUR WORK ON- THE- SHE ROUND THE UP. HELP SUPPORTING VICTIMS OF HATE THAT CAME OUT OF THE S. R. EIGHTY S. A. P. I. CAUCUS- EQUITY BUDGET AND- BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH THE CRISIS AND- ASIAN HATE- RISING OUT. WITH CO THE FORTUNE WAS THERE BEFORE BUT IT DEFINITELY ROSE WITH CODED. AND- UNFORTUNATELY OF SOME SOME LEADERS NATIONALLY WHO WHO PUT A TARGET ON APR WITH WORDS LIKE CHINA VIRUS AND- CONFLUENCE SO FORTH. AND FORTY WE ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS. I GUESS IT IN AGAIN APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH COMMISSION AND THE CAUCUS- CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO IN TERMS OF- HOW MANY- SO YOU TALKED ABOUT IT HOPEFULLY IN APRIL TWENTY SECOND SO I KNOW IT TAKES TIME TO STAND UP THESE PROGRAMS- THAT WE GET SOME INITIAL MONEY OUT AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA DO THE TRANSFORMATION WORK AND- CENTS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THIS. SPRING HE SPEAK TO THE SIZE OF THE TRANSFORMATION FUNDS THAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO DISTRIBUTE SO- IN IN THE SPRING BUT WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT OUR FATE ON THE LOOKING LIKE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE THE QUESTION CENTER CAN. DAY THAT TRANSFORMED OF GRANT FUNDING THAT IS IT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED BY. RSA IT'S AN INVITATION PROCESS- BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE POOL OF APPLICANTS IN PART. WHO OUTSIDE FOR THE STOP THE HATE GRANT PROGRAMS- AND FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THE FIELD AROUND THE ABILITY TO CAPACITY TO ABSORB ADDITIONAL FUNDING- SO ED. THESE ARE INVITATION ONLY GRANTS- THEY WILL BE AWARDED IN AMOUNTS OF A MINIMUM OF A MILLION DOLLARS- AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT BETWEEN. THE POOL AND STOP THE HATE AND THE POOL OF TRANSFORMATIVE GRANTEES BEING ABLE TO ALLOCATE THE TOTAL THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR OKAY EXCELLENT AND- IN EVERYONE THE CHALLENGES FOR THE API COMMUNITIES OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN TREMENDOUSLY UNDERFUNDED BOTH EITHER BY GOVERNMENT. OR BY PHILANTHROPY- THERE IS SOME THE FUNDING- THAT'S BEING DISTRIBUTED ARE YOU SURPRISED I ASSUME IT'S GONNA BE MORE TRANSFORMATION GRANT. IS GONNA IS IN TERMS OF CAPACITY BUILDING BECAUSE I THINK PART OF THE REASON WE'RE HAVING THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACING. IS THAT AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TREMENDOUSLY UNDERFUNDED COMMUNITY. AND L. TWO OFF AND YEAH API GET LEFT OUT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT COMMUNITIES OR DISADVANTAGED AND SO FORTH EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE DATA SHOW THAT'S NOT TRUE- SO I JUST. WANT IS IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT CAPACITY BUILDING AND COMMUNITY HOW HOW DO WE GET HOW TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY BECAUSE HE SAID I AGREE WITH YOU YOU CAN'T YOU DON'T GIVE PEOPLE MORE MONEY THEY CAN USE OR HANDLE RIGHT WE DON'T WASTE WE DON'T WANT. AN APPROPRIATE USE OF FUNDS WHICH- BUT WE IS A HIGHLY BILL THAT CAPACITY IN IT IN THE API COMMUNITY- SO THAT- SO WE CAN DELIVER MORE. SERVICES AND SUPPORT TO THE COMMUNITY. ABSOLUTELY DANGER AND JUST CAPACITY BUILDING HAS COME UP A LOT IN THE IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD THE LISTENING SESSIONS- WITH. WITH AS STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS OUR WORK WITH THE COMMISSION. WE ARE REALLY ENVISIONING THESE TRANSFORMATIVE FRANCE AS AS A MEANS TOWARD BUILDING THAT CAPACITY. FUNDING YOU KNOW THE SPECIFIC ANTI HATE SERVICES ANTI HE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO IN THE PROCESS BUILDING IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO BE ABLE TO SCALE UP THEIR OPERATIONS- YOU KNOW- ALLOCATING THE FUNDING OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT THERE IS SOME RAMP UP- AND CHAT. SO THE TRANSFORMATIVE FRANCE WILL ACTUALLY BE OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD A MINIMUM OF A MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS TO ALLOW FOR SOME OF THAT AT SOME OF THAT GROWTH WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. WE'VE ALSO BEEN REALLY. HEARTENED TO SEE THE INTERESTING COLLABORATIONS IN THE INTEREST IN SOME OF THESE LARGER MORE ESTABLISHED ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKING WITH. YOUR GROUPS THAT ARE SMALLER GROUPS THAT HAS YOU KNOW. LARGELY VOLUNTEER BASED. RATHER THAN A LOT OF PERMANENT EMPLOYEES AND REALLY WORKING TO BRING THOSE ORGANIZATIONS A LAUNCH AND AS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS I SUB GRANTEES- AND SO WE REALLY ARE EXPECTING THIS FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO BE THIRTY YEARS TO BUILD SOME OF THAT CAPACITY. THAT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT IS SO NEEDED IN THE SPACE. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN I GUESS FINALLY RELATION TO THIS- BY MORE COMMENT THAN A QUESTION IS THAT OF COURSE WE ALSO NEED TO BUILD LANGUAGE CAPACITY NOW A LOT OF A COMMUNICATIONS HAVE THAT LANGUAGE CAPACITY BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT- IS. NO THIS FUNDING IS USED TO HELP BRIDGE TOWARD- GREAT INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING HERE AT ST WHICH WE TALK ABOUT LIKE A MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER TYPES OF. SOCIAL SERVICES ETCETERA. I THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG BARRIERS IS LANGUAGE AND- IS SO. AND US YOU KNOW THE API COMMITTEE SPEAKS MANY MANY LANGUAGES SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST HAVE SPANISH AND YOU'RE DONE- ALTHOUGH I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S VARIOUS DIALECTS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY SO IT'S- AS WELL SO THAT- BUT I THINK FOR THE PARTICULAR FOR THE API COMMUTERS MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SO WE- WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT. WHEN YOU KNOW BUILDING LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND LANGUAGE CASSIDY IN THE STATE ITSELF IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND- SO I THINK AS WE LOOK AT- INVESTMENTS IN THAT REGARD THAT DOES LINK UP TO IS WE'RE BUILDING PASSING COMMUNITIES FOR THE COMMUNITIES AND REFER PEOPLE FOR STATE SERVICES- AND WHETHER TO COUNTIES ARE DIRECTLY THE STATE WE NEED TO HAVE THE LANGUAGE CAPACITY- THE- TERMS OF. ONE CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE OF- THE H. I. COCCUS IN THIS PART OF THE LATINO CAUCUS AND ADVOCATING FOR ONE CALIFORNIA AGAIN I GUESS THERE'S A CAPACITY ISSUE WHICH I APPRECIATE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT- THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING TO SO IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING. THAT YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT OF- WHAT'S BEING SUGGESTED IN TERMS OF BUILDING A CASTING AND DOJ. BUT YOU KNOW IT IS A SOMEONE LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT- WE TRY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS OUT. THERE- AND THAT'S FOR THE REASON YOU. YEAH ONLY SO MANY SOME YOU CAN FIND OUT THERE BUT THEN ALSO- THINKING ABOUT- ADDITION TO. HOW DO YOU GROW THAT PIPELINE- WHAT IS THE DEMAND SELECTION MAYBE HIS SPEECH ALSO WHAT'S OF THE MAN FROM ONE CALIFORNIA SERVICES THAT THIS THE AGENCY HAS SEEN SO- AND- BASICALLY HOW MUCH. HOW FAR BEHIND- IN TRYING TO MEET THAT- THAT NEED. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION A GOOD MAN I THINK THAT- THAT THEY NEED ONCE WE SOMETIMES A TO CHANGES IN FEDERAL POLICY. THAT YOU KNOW AS WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN THERE'S BEEN NEED FOR REMOVAL DEFENSE THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN- PERHAPS NATURALIZATION APPLICATIONS AND OTHER YOU KNOW RIGHTS DACA BENEFITS THAT THAT HAVE. BEEN IN DEMAND AT DIFFERENT TIMES SO I THINK THAT THE TYPE OF CAPACITY WOULD BUILD OUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE DO HAVE A LEGAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM OKAY DEPARTMENT GETS FUNDING. FOR MOBILE DEFENSE IN PARTICULAR AND THIS IDEA OF EXPANDING THE CAPACITY THROUGH- VA ACCREDITED- DEPARTMENT JUSTICE ACCREDITED REPRESENTATIVES IT IS THAT IDEA THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW WE DON'T CONTROL THAT THE PIPELINE FOR IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS BUT WE CAN HELP TRAIN ADDITIONAL- STAFF THAT CAN. YOU KNOW THEY CAN HAVE THAT AT THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF IMMIGRATION LAWS AND THE ETHICS TRAININGS IN ALL OF THE OTHER REQUIRED HE SAYS. TO REALLY PROVIDE- CLEARING. ON ON THE PATH THREE. BENEFITS SO THAT WE IS SOMETHING FOR JUST BEHIND THE THING OF A SUPPORTING THOSE TYPE OF A CREDIT EUROPE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH YEARS OF LAW SCHOOL OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAINING.

AS YOU HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC DSS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING MAJOR CHILD WELFARE REFORMS AND YOU PROGRAMS INCLUDING AND NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FROM CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS EFFORTS TO BUILD IN STATE PASSAGE YOU TAKE CARE FOR YOUTH WITH COMPLEX NEEDS AND ONGOING CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION- AND- WE HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT BOTH RESPONDING TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AS WELL AS CARRYING OUT THESE MAJOR PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES HAS INVOLVED- SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS- GIVEN THE SIZEABLE EFFORTS AS WELL AS THE- LARGE ONE TIME THE FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS- FOR CHILD WELFARE. INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET WE FIND THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEES FOCUSED ON- OVERSIGHT AND REQUESTING IMPLEMENTATION THE PROGRESS UPDATES TODAY IS WARRANTED- WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND THE STATUS OF A CURRENT YEAR AUGMENTATIONS- TO HELP ENCOURAGE THINKING AROUND WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES MAY BE NEEDED- FOR VARIOUS TRAVEL FOR GRAMS INCLUDING ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION- IN THE CURRENT BUDET YEAR THAT WOULD HELP THE DEPARTMENT- FULLY ALLOCATE AND DISBURSE THE BUDGET AND FUNDS. FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- I WILL NOTE THE WE PUBLISHED INITIAL AND- OF THE GOVERNOR'S CHILD WELFARE PROPOSALS- LAST WEEK AND IN THAT INITIAL ANALYSIS- WE RAISED- A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA AND WHICH WERE ALREADY SPOKEN TO YOU- BY TRACTOR JOHNSON AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHORTS. SO I WON'T REITERATE THOSE NOW- THE JUST ONE ADDITIONAL POINT WE DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS A RELATED TO THE STATE'S PANDEMIC RESPONSE WITHIN CHILD WELFARE- AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FIGURE THAT'S INCLUDED ON PAGES TWELVE AND THIRTEEN. GENDA PROVIDINGA SUMMARY OF STATE FUNDS FOR PANDEMIC RESPONSE WITHIN CHILD WELFARE. MOST OF THOSE PANDEMIC RESPONSE ACTIVITIES EITHER HAVE PARTY AND DID- OR ARE YOU TO. IN THE TIME SINCE THE ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS- OUR STATE HAS EXPERIENCED THE OMICRON VARIANTS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC SITUATION HAS CONTINUED TO RECALLS- AS SUCH WE SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. ONE WHETHER ANY CHILD WELFARE PANDEMIC RESPONSE ACTIVITIES- IN ADDITION TO THE HELP LINE SHOULD BE- CONTINUED INTO THE BUDGET YEAR GIVEN THE ONGOING PENDANT IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC PARTICULARLY ON VULNERABLE FAMILIES AND TO- HOW THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO PRIORITIZE ANY ON GOING- SUPPORTS THAT ARE PROVIDED- I DON'T STOP THERE FOR NOW THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TWENTY DIRECTOR DRESS AS NICE TO HAVE YOU RECOGNIZED AS TRYING TO DO ALL OF US IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC ALL THESE MASSIVE CHANGES END. I DON'T THINK WE CAN UNDERSCORE ENOUGH WORKING WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY VARIOUS FORCES IN LIFE. NOT JUST- THEIR FAMILIES DOING BUT OFTENTIMES BY THE SITUATIONS THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN- AND I'M SO I GUESS THE QUESTION OF THE L. A. DO WE NEED MORE. PANDEMIC RESPONSE NOW TO DEFER TO FAMILY STILL NEED MORE SUPPORT YOU HAD SOME PROBLEMS GETTING ENOUGH OUT WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS COMPLICATED. BUT WILL BE MORE MORE MORE NEED TO BE DONE TO SUPPORT. I MEAN THE FRAGILE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN THE FRAGILE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM THAT FAMILIES FIND THEMSELVES LIVING IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AFTER THE QUESTIONS HERE AND CERTAINLY ADD FIFTY DIRECTOR SHORTS OUTLINED KIND OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS INCLUDING IN TERMS OF CONTINUATION OF BECAUSE ONE THING. THAT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT IT IS CERTAINLY PART OF OUR PROCESS STEP IS THE NUMBER OF FLEXIBILITY STRAIGHT IN ADDITION TO THE ACTUAL FUNDING AND APPRECIATE THE L. R. ELLIE AS OUTLINED OF THEIR INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE- IN TERMS THAT SUPPORT AGAIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SPEAKS TO THOSE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE OTHER HAVE BEEN ECHOED COUNTLESS THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY COUNTS THE NUMBER. OF ALL COUNTY LETTER LETTERS- IN GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS AND I THINK THIS DEPARTMENTS PUT OUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IT'S JUST BEEN TREMENDOUS I WANTED TO JUST TAKE THAT BRIEF OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LIFT UP IN A PRE SHAPE MY STAFF INVOLVED IN. WORKING I DON'T. BRING THE KENNELS ON BOTH ENDS AS THEY STAGE ITS WORK ON THESE THINGS. I RECOGNIZING THE URGENCY IN NEED BUT I THINK ALSO AS WE LOOK AT AND SHE DALY IS AT POINT AROUND. KIND OF WE HAD DIFFERENT VARIANTS YOU CAN DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES TO THIS PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORT CENTER NEEDED WE'VE BEEN LOOKING KIND OF HOLISTICALLY AT THE FLEXIBILITIES. AND THAT WE'VE BEEN PLACE HASSLING CONVERSATION ENGAGEMENT WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COUNTIES AROUND THOSE FLEXIBILITIES AND ARE EXPLORING IN THINKING THROUGH. WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF ANY CONTINUATION OF THOSE OR THINKING ABOUT WAYS THAT WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE. I SHOULD THERE BE A NEED IN THE FUTURE I THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT AT DECISION POINTS MCKENNA SCORED ENOUGH RIGHT THE IDEA THAT. MAYBE WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOCIAL WORKERS AT INTER I MEAN I'M VISITS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE BEST INTEREST OF HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT ALSO. HEALTH AND SAFETY SAFETY IN TERMS OF THAT. TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE OF CHILDREN ACT HUGE HUGE AT DECISION POINTS IN JUST A SECOND GRATEFUL FOR AND BOSTOCK PARTNERS ON THESE FRONTS TO GO FORWARD SO. THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE KIND OF WHAT'S OUTLINED NOW IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS IN THE SPACE AND I THINK WE'LL CERTAINLY WANT TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. IN A LONGER TERM ON ON WHAT ELSE WE'RE SEEING WHETHER NEEDS ARE MERGING. I ANTICIPATE YOUR PANEL THE THINGS THAT THERE'S EMERGING CLERK. WHEN YOU SAY WE WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE SOCIAL WORKERS. YOUR TO SOMEBODY WHO- THE AGING HAS DETERMINED IS A SOCIAL WORKER NOT SOMEBODY WITH AN ACTUAL DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK AS SOCIAL WORKERS DO NOT YET HAVE CATTLE. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING COUNTY STAFF OKAY MISTER VERY MUCH- ON THE- BEING ABLE TO DO SO LIKE LOOKING AT A CONTINUING CARE AYE I THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THE BY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE OF CARE RIGHT WE AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUT A LOT MORE MONEY ON THE UP FRONT PART WHICH IS. VITALLY IMPORTANT. BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF KIDS WHO ARE VERY AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK MORE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY- LATER ON IN THE- COMMUNICABLE MONTHS I THINK- BUT THESE KIDS WHO ARE WHO HAVE. INTERACTION WITH WITH DJ AS OF AT IN IN ADDITION TO CHILD WELFARE ON THAT ARE OFTEN THE HARDEST TO PLACE- THAT I THAT I FEAR SOMETIMES GET LOST WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT PREVENTION INTERVENTION WHICH IS IMPORTANT. BUT WE STILL HAVE THESE VERY HIGH NEED KIDS THAT CAN COUNTIES ARE TRYING TO STRUGGLE TO FIND WHERE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND A PLACE FOR THEM. HOWEVER WE HELLO CONTINUING TO ADDRESS AT THE END OF THE CONTINUE WHILE WHILE WE CONTINUE TO BUILD SUPPORT ALONG THE WAY. PRESHEAF FACT QUESTION AND AN ABSOLUTELY TO FOCUS THE BUYERS AND- I THINK CERTAINLY- NOT ONLY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC MAKES VARIANTS RIGHT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE AND AT CHILDREN AND USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. UNIT THAT NEEDS OF CHILDREN THAT SPEND. ALSO SEEING SOME INCREASE THE OBVIOUSLY IN THE CHILD WELFARE SPACE HERE AND SO- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY. WITH COUNTIES WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE ISSUE WITH COMPLEX NEEDS WHETHER THEY WHAT. IF I CAN'T HAVE CHALLENGES FINDING. OUT A PLACE FOR EITHER A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM ARE AT THEIR FIND A COMPLETE ON THE HIGHER END OF THE CONTINUUM OF SUPPORTS ACT. AT THE INVESTMENTS THAT AND IF YOU DIRECTOR SHORTS I JUST REFERENCED IN TERMS THAT HAVING DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED FOR CHILD SPECIFIC. SOLUTIONS MAYBE SOMETHING DOESN'T EXIST BUT NEEDS TO BE RESOURCE OR ADDITIONAL WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS THAT NEED TO BE. INVESTED IN TO ENSURE THAT. YOU CAN BE WITH A RELATIVE OR AND OTHER. PLACEMENTS OPTION. BUT ALSO A KIND OF ACROSS THE CONTINUUM SO THAT AT DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHORTS MENTIONS. THE ACT GAPS ANALYSIS TO LOOK IN THIS IS AGAIN WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS WITH EIGHTY TWENTY EIGHTY THREE TO SAY. IN MY COMMUNITY WHAT ARE THE NEEDS. OF INDIVIDUAL YOU'D BETTER BEING PRESENTED AND DO I HAVE ENOUGH. FOR THE VARIOUS- CAPACITY ACROSS THAT CONTINUUM TO SUPPORT THEM. AND SAID THOSE INVESTMENTS AROUND LOOKING AT THAT FULL CAPACITY IN IDENTIFYING THOSE GAPS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW. I WE'VE RECENTLY ALSO KIND OF COMPILED A FULL LIST OF. AB WITH THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. FOR EXCUSE ME I ALSO DID REFERENCE THE PILOT THAT WAS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE PILOT THAT WILL BE ADDED. GOING FORWARD WITH TO AS ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THE YOUTH WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS AND HOW WE'RE SUPPORTING THEM. BUT I WAS JUST GONNA MENTION THAT WE HAVE A WHOLE COMPILATION OF NOT ONLY THE INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE HERE OUT TOGETHER BETWEEN ADMINISTRATOR. MINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT ALSO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES NOT ONLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT. IN OUR STAFF BUT ALSO FROM. PARTNERS CONSULTING AND THERE'S GAMES THAT HINTING ON THE INTO THE NEEDS OF THE YOUTH WHO ALSO MANY TO BRING IN. OTHER EXPERTISE IN. IN SUPPORT. US WITH THE U. OF THAT OUR BEST SUITED FOR EVANS. ABSOLUTELY YES OKAY OF OUR- IN IN IN THAT WE SPENT. MATCHING GAUGE IN WITH COUNTIES. THIS ABOUT IN. CONTINGENCY PLANNING NUMBER THE STATE WHERE THE STATE AGENCY THAT HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL THE COUNTIES. WHAT HOW MANY COUNTIES WOULD YOU SAY HAVE ENOUGH FOSTER CARE HOMES I MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I HEAR IN EVERY COUNTY I REPRESENT. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOSTER CARE HOMES IT'S REALLY HARD TO. RECRUIT AND RETAIN HOMES. IT HOW WE DOING WITHOUT ACROSS THE STATE STATEWIDE. YEAH WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN INCREASES. OVER TIME AGAIN AS I MENTIONED. IN THE OPENING ON C. C. R.

AT THE DIRECTORS WERE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE ANY SPECIFICS THERE I KNOW WE RELEASED A QUARTERLY REPORT AT JUST LATER ON ON THE SPECIFICS WE DID SEE. A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE IN THE YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF ABILITY TO RECRUIT BUT CERTAINLY I'VE HAD SINCE SEEN UPWARD TICK OVER TIME AND THAT'S EXPECTS THE TREND WE WOULD EXPECT AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT GOING FORWARD BUT- I THINK YOU DIRECTOR PORTS.

EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW I THINK WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON AND OUR PANEL- NEWS FROM MR- BRAM BLAYLOCK SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE YOUTHFUL LAW AND CENTER- AND THEN WE HAVE CREW- CHRISTINE STONER MERTZ CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF YOUTH AND FAMILIES. AND KRISTIN AND- I MISS UNDERWENT- THE CHILD ABOVE YOURS OKAY SO LET'S GET STARTED- MISTER BLAYLOCK. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH UNIVERSALLY COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW I WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE CAN STABILIZE YOU FAMILIES. AND I JUST WANNA START WITH IS PUTTING OUT THERE ISN'T HUGE IMPROVEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN THE CONTINUING CARE REFORM- THAT REPORT IT WAS JUST ISSUED TODAY IT'S FANTASTIC pHEARD THE DEPARTMENT TALK SOME ABOUT IT ALREADY. JUST MAKE GREAT STRIDES IN HELPING US REDUCE RELIANCE ON INSTITUTIONS WHERE CHILDREN USED TO THE WORSE INCREASING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN TO STAY WITH RELATIVES AND RESOURCE FAMILIES WHICH IS WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE CHILDREN DO BEST AND WHERE WE MOST WANT OUR CHILDREN IF HE CANNOT BE AT HOME WITH PARENTS- IT CALIFORNIA'S REDUCE COUNTY CARE BY SIXTY PERCENT. DURING THAT INITIATIVE SO IT'S CURRENTLY AROUND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR SO OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND USE THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN FOSTER CARE. AND REALLY INCREASED USE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO STAY WITH FAMILY AND COMMUNIY- AND I THINK I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT CELEBRATE THAT SUCCESS TO REALIZE WHAT'S WORKING- BUT OF COURSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WE SHOULD ALWAYS ALSO BE ASKING WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO- SO A COUPLE OF THINGS KEY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SO THAT YOU CAN STAY AT HOME. WE KNOW THEY BOTH WANT TO BE AND SUCCEED I'M GOING. TO GO THROUGH A FEW NUMBER ONE. OUR WORK UPSTREAM. TO IMPROVE REAL. HEALTH ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGE ASK OF PLEASE IN SEARCH. THAT'S WHEN SHE- ARE CORD. IN THE KEEP GETTING MOVED FROM PLACE TO PLACE. WHERE THE MOST DAMAGING ASPECTS OF THAT IS THE DAMAGE THIS YOUNG PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIPS. I STILL NEED TO MOVE UPSTREAM TO STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS AND PREVENT THOSE DESTRUCTION FROM HAPPENING. IN THE FIRST PLACE I WANT REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE BUT SURE TELL ME- DEPLOYS EXPERIENCED RESOURCE FAMILIES TO MENTOR COACH AND-SUPPORT FAMILIES. IN SENDS OUT THESE PEER EDUCATORS WHEN A RESOURCE FAMILY REPORTS CHALLENGES- THIS PROGRAM'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THAT PEER TO PEER RELATIONSHIP AND REALLY STRENGTH IN THAT NETWORK TO PREVENT PLACEMENT DISRUPTIONS. US INVESTING FURTHER IN PROGRAMS LIKE THAT SO WE CAN WORK UPSTREAM- WOULD BE VITAL. A NUMBER TO. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES AND INITIATIVES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE WHICH INCLUDES VCR IN TEAM CARE REFORM. ALSO INCLUDES FAMILIES FIRST- NCSS IS. NEW INVESTMENT SUPPORTS FOR YOUTH WITH COMPLEX NEEDS. HANDS ON MEDICAID SIDE- IN ITS FIRST YEAR ON THE ELIGIBILITY FOR SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REQUIRING DIAGNOSIS. NEW BENEFITS COMING THROUGH THE NCOS INCLUDING ENHANCED CASE MANAGEMENT. TO ALL OF THESE ARE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY SPORTS WHERE YOU NEED THEM THE MOST IN THE COMMUNITY AND AT HOME. HOW DO WE LEVERAGE SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HEALTH SYSTEMS TO ADOPT NEW FAMILY THERAPY AND YOU SEE AND THEN IF IT'S- TO EXPAND ACCESS TO INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT IN. FOR EXAMPLE PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE AND OTHER PLACES. WHERE AT RISK POPULATIONS USED CAN AND WANT TO ACCEPT ACCESS THEM. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY MUCH OF WHAT WE DO ENSURE SUCCESS IN THESE INITIATIVES GOING FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WILL BE REALLY RELIANCE ON WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO AND HOW WE'RE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH NGOS IN THE STATE- AND ALSO WITH WHAT WE DO WITH OUR WORK FORCE. NOW WE SUPPORT AN EXPANSION OF THE THERAPEUTIC. WORK FORCE HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. ALSO BY TO BE SICK. NUMBER THREE ON MY- THE SILO. WE HAVE THIS. FREE MORE WE SAW HAVE A LOT OF TO DO OKAY. DECIDED ASSIST. THAT DELIVERY OF A TO RECALL INVOLVED USE THAT INCLUDE FOSTER AND YOU KNOW JUSTICE. DO AND GETTING TO OUR SHARED GOALS FOR THESE USERS ARE GETTING EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY. TO HELP STAY IN THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR FAMILIES IS GONNA RELY HEAVILY ON THE DELIVERY SEAMLESS AND INTEGRATED THERAPEUTIC SERVICES ON EVERY LEVEL. THIS INCLUDES OMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX RELATED HEALTH NEEDS. BUT ALSO TRAUMA RESPONSES SERVICES THAT WORK UPSTREAM SUPPORTING CHILDREN WHO'VE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. AND FRANKLY THAT'S ALL OF US AT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN IN THE SYSTEMS SO THEY'RE GIVEN THE TOOLS TO THRIVE. AND BUILD RESILIENCY IN STATE ALMOST FAMILIES IN A POSITIVE HEALTHY WAY. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE NEED CHILDREN FAVOR OFTEN TELL WELFARE. AT THE SAME TABLE SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE AND CREATING CLEAR METHODOLOGIES AND PROCESSES AND THE CHILDREN CAN EASILY ACCESS THE SERVICES THEY NEED. SO THAT ON THE GROUND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CCR AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT USING YOU TO STAY WITH FAMILIES. THE PEOPLE WORKING WITH THE ISSUE OF THE AND THE USE AND THE FAMILIES CAN SAY I KNOW EXACTLY THIS IS HOW I NEEDED TO ACCESS THE SUPPORTS THAT WE NEED. AND RIGHT NOW. CONTAGION IS FAIRLY EVEN ACROSS THE STATE SO THIS IS GONNA TAKE SOME WORK EVEN JUST TRANSLATING TERMS AND LANGUAGES BETWEEN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN THE HOUSE SYSTEM CAN BE A DIFFICULT STARTING POINT. WE ALSO TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE SYSTEMS ARE DOING SHARED BUDGET PLANNING INSIGHT AND FUNDING. FOR EXAMPLE BEING SURE THAT THE NON FEDERAL MATCH FOR MEDICAID REIMBURSABLE SERVICES- FOR VEHICLE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR THERAPEUTIC SERVICES CAN BE APPROPRIATELY LEVERAGE SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE. WE KNOW HOW TO LEVERAGE THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS TO BE SURE THAT THEY'RE BUILDING THE SYSTEM THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED AND MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE FOR THEM- TO REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS FOR ACCESS- DISAPPOINTS ALSO NEED TO INCLUDE SERVICES THAT USE. EXCESSIVE OLDER YOUTH ONE- SO TO MORE QUICKLY VITAL POINTS YOUR NUMBER FOUR WE HAVE TO DEAL SERVICES THAT USE ONE IN NEED- THIS MAY INCLUDE THERAPEUTIC BEHAVIORAL SERVICES MULTI SYSTEMIC THERAPY LIKE TYPES OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WE KNOW. THAT HAVE BEEN EXPONENTIALLY SUCCESSFUL YOUR CALIFORNIA'S RECORD INVOLVED USED BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES SERVICES WE MAY NOT TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AS MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS- BUT THEY CAN HELP CONTRIBUTE TO OVERALL CHILD WELL BEING WELL THEY PROMOTE- PLACEMENT STABILITY- THINGS THAT WE MAY THINK OF THIS EXTRA CURRICULAR OR ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES LIKE DANCE LIKE KARATE LIKE SPORTS TEAMS THE STUFF WE KNOW THE KIDS WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN. AND CAN REALLY BENEFIT FROM IT THAT PROMOTES SOCIAL COHESION AND SOCIAL CAPITAL ACCORDING TO ALL DO YOU THINK SPECIALLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS- AND ARE USED WHO ALSO NEED THEM THE MOST- YOU FOSTER WHERE I WORK RECENTLY DID A SURVEY OF-RESOURCE FAMILIES IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE ALMOST 70% REPORTED THAT WHEN THEY REQUESTED THEY RECEIVE SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS FOR THEIR CHILDREN 60% SAID THEY DID NOT RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO PARTICIPATE IN EXTRACURRICULAR ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES AND HALF SAID THEY DID NOT RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN TO MAINTAIN OR BUILD SOCIAL AND PEER RELATIONSHIPS. TO SAY HOW IMPORTANT PLACEMENT STABILITY IS SO IMPORTANT OUR RELATIONSHIPS RELATIONSHIP BUILDING ACTIVITIES THAT SOCIAL COHESION AND SOCIAL CAPITAL THAT'S SO IMPORTANT WE NEED TO INVEST IN THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN WHO NEED THEM THE MOST. AND LASTLY NUMBER FIVE AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO USE AND BUILDING A REAL OPPORTUNITY AND WAYS TO DO THIS YOU KNOW WHAT THEY NEED AND BASED ON THE INCREASING TECHNOLOGY THERE'S REALLY NO EXCUSE FOR US NOT TO BE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM. DEGRADE US TO TELL US HOW WE'RE DOING AS SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN THESE COMMUNITIES- I CAN USE MY PHONE RIGHT NOW AND FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF ALL THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING FOR SERVICE SUPPORTS FREE. BASED ON YOU ON INPUT VALUE. A UTILITY. ALSO REAL. AND HOW FIX THE SYSTEM. TO CREATING PROGRAMS TO. AND HELPED SHAPE WELFARE SYSTEM AND CAN ADJUST SYSTEM. HIGHER MORSE LIVE NEXT. IN SUPPORT THAT. SIMILAR CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT IN THE EMS. IS A FANTASTIC PROGRAM IT'S AN ALAMEDA COUNTY IS GROWING IN DIFFERENT PLACES- THAT WOULD BE VITAL IN KEY TO HELPING MAKE OUR SYSTEMS MORE EQUITABLE AND FAIR. AND HELP US TO GET TO OUR GOALS OF KEEPING CHILDREN FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BUSH AND I APOLOGIZE MISFORTUNE DID YOU WANNA MAKE A TRIP PRESENTATION. ABOUT THIS CONNECTING YOUTH AND FAMILIES AND SUPPORTING USE VALUE BASED CARE OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE.

WHILE I TALKED THE IN. IN OUR AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT YEAR THAT WILL. TO THE FAMILY FINE. AN ENGAGING ACTIVE AND ALL IT TO CONTINUE THAT REALLY. I'M THINKING IF I CAN'T WORK IN A CRUISE. THE REMARKS OF THE ANALYSTS- OTHER THE ADDITION THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE. THAT WE DO AND TO SUPPORT KIDS THE FAMILY BUT JUST WANTED TO KILL PROVIDE THAT DOES INCOME AND- OF YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MY APOLOGIES. L. A. O. DID. EN ROUTE ON THIS WE MOVE TO MISS THE NEW ENGLAND. BUT YES THANK YOU- AGAIN ANGELA SHORT WITH L. A. O. JUST WANNA READ FOLK COMMENT- THE RESOURCE FAMILY ARE. PROCESS AS WELL DISCUSSED UNDER THE AYE DON'T WANNA THE PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR BUDGET IS FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT BACKLOG EVERY SOURCE FAMILY- APPLICATIONS PENDING BEYOND DJS- AS WE JUST HEARD FROM DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHORTS. WHILE THAT APPROVAL TIME IS TRENDING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION- TO DATE IT IS STILL ABOVE NINETY DAYS- BUT WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT- THERE IS A STATUTORY CHANGE SET TO TAKE EFFECT JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THAT WILL- SHORTEN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT RELATIVES WHO ARE EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS- CAN RECEIVE FOSTER CARE MAINTENANCE. PAYMENTS PRIOR TO COMPLETING THAT RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL. AND THAT IS THAT TO DECREASE TO NINETY DAYS. AND THAT'S A DECREASE FROM THE CURRENT YEAR- STATUTE STATUTORY TIME LINE WHICH IS A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS WITH A COUPLE OF GOOD BECAUSE EXTEND. UP. TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS- SO GIVE THE CURRENT. AS WELL SOME AGAIN THE SUCH AND- THE- THE PANDEMIC. WE WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER- WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU AD THEN STATUTES TO ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUATION OF A GOOD CAUSE EXTENSION- PARTICULARLY DURING THE PANDEMIC TO ENSURE THAT EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS DON'T LOSE ACCESS TO FOSTER PAYMENTS IF THEY EXPERIENCED. LATEST MARKET PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOTED HER. STUFF ON OUR SIDE ARTICLE NOTED. ABOUT THAT THAT ISSUE- MAJORITY IS THEIR PLAN THE DO TO TIGHTEN UP THAT TIME LIMIT DO YOU HAVE ONE. I THOUGHT MY COLLEAGUE IT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DEFERRED OKAY OKAY THANK YOU READY TO. THE PARTNER FINANCE YES JUST RAISED FROM FINANCE I DO THINK I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE FIRST THING- THAT THE EMERGENCY CAREGIVER ASSISTANCE PAYMENT WON'T STOP- AND NINETY DAYS WHAT WHAT THE WAY THAT THE STATUE TO STAND UP RIGHT NOW. GOING INTO THE BUDGET YEAR IS THAT THE STATE WILL COVER THE NON FEDERAL SHARE OF THAT ASSISTANCE PAYMENT FOR THE FIRST NINETY DAYS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT AN APPLICATION IS APPROVED THE CARE GIVERS AND APPROVED- STATE THAT THIS IS THE SAME IT MAY CONTINUE COUNTIES ON THE IN THE OPPOSITION THIRTY TWO ACTUALLY WITH THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND PAYMENT. IS JUST THE STATE WON'T COVER THE NONSTRUCTURAL SURE OF THAT- TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO- WILL DEMONSTRATION IS DONE IN THIS AREA IS HOW WE LOOK BACK AT WHETHER OR NOT. THAT WE NEED TO EXTEND BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS TEMPORARILY BASED ON NEW AND INCOMING DATA FROM THE FISCAL YEAR- WHAT HAPPENS IS EACH YEAR WE'VE BEEN SEEING THAT THE- APPLICATION TIMELINE APRIL TIMELINE IT'S BEEN DECLINING AS WE GET CLOSER TO NINETY DAYS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC OF COURSE. THE GRANITE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PANDEMIC TO CHANGE A FEW THINGS SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS LOOKING AT THE NEED TO EXTENDED A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS TO NEED TO EXTEND FOR LONGER AND THEN WE NEED TO THE POTENTIAL INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR COUNTIES. TO ADDRESS ANY SORT OF BACKLOG ISSUES AND THEN GO FROM THERE BECAUSE THE GOAL EVENTUALLY WAS TO HAVE NINETY DAYS TO HAVE THESE FAMILY CAREGIVERS APPROVED AUTHORIZED AND READY TO GO TO TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUES WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME- THE OTHER THING THAT I LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SUMERIANS SETS. REFOREST THEIR RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS IS A REAL LINES PROGRAMS SO IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY OF COUNTIES AND IS EXPANDING WAS INCLUDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND REALIGNMENT FOR THAT'S SO THE AUGMENTATIONS IN IT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE INCLUDING HAVE BEEN THESE DIVERSE SPORTS TO HELP ASSIST COUNTY SPENT WITH US. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ON THE NECESSARY. MMHM OKAY THE- THANK YOU BUT LET'S GO TO A SAID MCDONNELL EXEC DIRECTOR COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS THIS. THANK YOU DR ED JERRY AND CAN APPRECIATE THE OFFER TO IN TODAY'S. TODAY'S PANEL. I WAS ALSO ASKED TO TALK ABOUT IT OF THAT THAT CAN ARE ACTIVELY IN RELATED YOU OVER PRETEND AND AT APPROVAL OUT OF BOB FOSTER FAMILIES AND IN PARTICULAR I'LL BE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT THE L. A. O. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPRESENTED REPRESENTATIVE JUST MADE- AS WELL SO IT'S TIMELY TO COME TO THE NEXT- I DON'T THINK WE PLAY ON THAT BUT WE CAN NEVER PLANNED ON MATTER. SO- ONE OF THE- THINGS THAT I WAS ASKED TO TALK TO SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING FOSTER FAMILIES ESPECIALLY RELATIVES WHO AS YOU'VE HEARD ARE JUST THAT PREFERRED OPTION WHEN CHILDREN COME INTO CARE. IF WE CAN FIND A RELATIVE OR A NON RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER WE WILL- DID MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO DO THAT AND- WHERE THAT FAMILY. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BOTH IN REDUCING CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS AS WELL AS HAVING A SIGNIFICANT. PERCENTAGE OF OUR PLACEMENTS WITH THE FAMILY WHETHER THAT'S A RELATIVE NON RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER OR ANOTHER THEY HAVE FOSTER FAMILY OF SOME KIND. WE'VE BEEN OUT ABOUT 86% OF THE CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF CC ARE PLACED WITH A FAMILY OF SOME KIND DURING FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT- I WILL MENTION AS WALTER DR EGGMAN GIVEN YOUR- COMMENT EARLIER- AND DR PANAS WELLS PASSION ABOUT DATA. WE HAVE REALLY EXCELLENT DATA IN OUR SYSTEM BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING NOW FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES WITH UC BERKELEY- DOES CENTER FOR SOCIAL SERVICES RESEARCH. COLFAX NOT JUST THE FEDERAL OUTCOME MEASURES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO TRACK AND REPORT ON BUT ON EITHER A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS DEPENDING ON WHAT THE DATA ARE. THEY TRACK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION POINT IN TIME PLACEMENTS- AGE RACE AND ETHNICITY ACTUALLY PRETTY AMAZING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK AND SEE. TWENTY YEARS WORTH OF DATA AND HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY SORTS OF LINKS OR INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. BUT IT'S- IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE RESOURCE FOR COUNTIES INDIVIDUALLY AND IT CERTAINLY HAS FOR US IN REPRESENTING COUNTIES AND COUNTY. HUMAN SERVICES HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I THINK THAT SHE SIERRA PUT INTO TO HAVE REALLY HOW AND- US TO RECRUIT AND- FAMILY CARE. OUR THE FOSTER PARENT. RETENTION AND SO- ALSO KNOWN AS THE FOR TIME. FOR USING THAT AKRAM DURING MY COMMENTS AS WELL AS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL OR ARE IN. I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FIRST FIRST. WHEN WE FIRST STARTED CC ARE BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN REALLY GOT THINGS GOING YOU CAN RIP YOU FOR JUST ONE SECOND IS A DISCREPANCY MISTER BOYLE TO SAID WE SHOULD USE THE SAME LANGUAGE ACROSS ALL SYSTEMS AND SO NOW. EVERYWHERE WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT THE FOR. THE FIRST. SEE FIRST BUT WITH NO HELP.OKAY THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF CATCHY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT- APPRECIATE THAT SO EVERYONE. BE PREPARED IF THE BIRTH PANGS- ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAD TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE STARTED WORKING ON EASIER AND THAT WE NEEDED TO WORK RIGHT. AND BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES WAS I THINK THIS IDEA THAT WE WERE GONNA LIVE INVEST. IN FAMILY RECRUITMENT WE GOT A CHUNK OF MONEY TO DO THAT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THEN I SHALLOW DOWN AND ACTUALLY GOTTEN ZEROED OUT. AND THIS CURRENT YEAR IS THE SECOND YEAR WERE IN THERE'S BEEN NO FUNDING UNDER THIS IS THE FIRST OF PROGRAM. AND THERE WAS THIS I THINK- YOU KNOW ASSUMPTION AND I THINK WE ALL MADE IT AS WE ARE WORKING IN THE SPACE. THAT WE WERE GOING TO GET ENOUGH FOSTER FAMILIES AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH WE DON'T REALLY NEED THEM FUNDING WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING SAVINGS FROM HAVING CHILDREN. PLACED WITH THE FAMILIES AND SO- EVERYTHING WE'RE KIND EQUALIZE THE KIND OF BALANCE OUT A WE WOULD. NEED THAT DEDICATED FUNDING. INTERESTINGLY NOT THAT HAVE AND I'M BIT OF A VICTIM OUR OWN. AND BEING A TO BETTER FIND. AND A FINE FAMILY. AND PLACED ON WITH AN- BECAUSE WHAT WE SEEN AS- OFTEN THE FAMILY IS FOR THAT CHILD OR FOR THOSE SIBLINGS THAT'S MORE THAN ONE SHOULDER AND- AND THEN WHEN THE FAMILY REUNITE. WHICH IS OUR GOAL AND SHE SAYS THEY DON'T AFRICA BIOLOGICAL FAMILY. THAT FOSTER PARENT WILL SAY YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE BECAUSE I WAS HERE FOR THAT KID. OR FOR THOSE CHILDREN. OR AT LEAST THEY WERE UNABLE IN FORCED LABOR UNIFIED BUT WE WANT GUARDIANSHIP OR ADOPTION. THEY DID THAT THEY FINALIZE THAT AND THEN THEY'RE GONE I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE THAT AS BASED RESOURCE. AND SO WHAT I THINK WE'VE COME TO REALIZE IS THAT. THIS RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. OF FINDING AND DOING RELATIVE BASED PLACEMENTS AND THEN GETTING CHILDREN IDEALLY EITHER BACK WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES OR JUST SOME KIND OF PERMANENCE WITH THOSE. WITH THOSE FAMILIES WE'RE GONNA JUST HAVE TO KEEP DOING THIS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND. SUPPORT RETAIN TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE BUT MORE I THINK IT'S ABOUT DEVELOPING REALLY JUST BETWEEN THE CHILDREN. AND THE CARE GIVERS THAT CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A ADOPTION WE BE UNABLE TO RE UNIFY THAT FAMILY. AND SO- WE'RE REQUESTING CONTINUED FUNDING FOR THE STATE FOR THE FIRST- PROGRAM. TO RECRUIT RETAIN. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND SUPPORT THOSE PLACEMENTS SO THE CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO REALLY THRIVE AND REMAIN TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. WITHOUT ONE. PLACEMENT THAT ONE CARE GIVER WHILE WE'RE WORKING TRYING TO REUNIFY. OUR QUESTIONS FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. GENERAL FUND WE'RE REQUESTING THAT THAT BE ON ONGOING AMOUNT SINCE WE DON'T THINK. THE NEED FOR THIS IS REALLY. GONNA GO AWAY. AND THE KINDS THEY THAT WE PROVIDED A COUNTY THAT HAVE BEEN. IN XP. CANS CAN SHOW SUPPORT SERVICE. AIMED DIRECTLY AT RELATIVE CHARACTER. PROVIDING REALLY. SUPPORT THAT COULD BE GAS. IF THEIR FREQUENT TRY TO. APPOINTMENTS GIFT CARD TO HELP PURCHASE ITEMS THAT YOU MAY NEED PENN TODDLER. FURNITURE OR OTHER THINGS OF THE HOME NEED. IN ORDER FOR THE REAL. TO BE ABLE BRING IN WATER MORE THAN ONE. THAT THEY WERE NOT X. TO HAVE LIVING IN THEIR HOME. WE'VE ALSO FUND HOUSING REPAIRS AND CAR REPAIRS BUT NEED A- IN ORDER FOR THE FAMILY TO. EVEN BE ABLE TO BE ABLE. UNDER OUR NAY OR BE ABLE TO TRANSPORT THAT CHILD TAKE THEM TO MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS OR TO VISITATION TO COURT AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WE'VE WHAT A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE FUNDING HAS BEEN USED TO PROVIDE RESPITE CARE. FOR CAREGIVERS- I MEAN I MIGHT COULD TURN DAY TODAY SO I'M A I'M A CARE GIVER AND I KNOW THAT YOU NEED. YOU NEED A BREAK SOMETIMES AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH A CHILD WHO YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED TO YOUR HAVE AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH. JUST TAKE A BREAK SOMETIMES AND HAVE THE SHALL BE SAFE AND CARED FOR I FEEL. FINE TO HAVE A FAMILY NIGHT OR AT YOU KNOW ONE NIGHT OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS OR OTHERS THAT THEY KNOW ALL. BUT NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING THERE FOR THEM A 100% OF THE TIME JUST LIKE ANYONE WOULD WANT TO HAVE A NIGHT OUT AS I AS A PARENT OF A- BIOLOGICAL CHILD WE TRY TO DO THAT AS WELL FOR THE ROLEX. THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ACTIVITIES AND BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT LIST YOU- BUT WERE I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING ABLE TO. CONTINUE TO FUND THESE EFFORTS THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. AND DIFFICULT ALWAYS TO SORT OF FIND THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE ACTIVITIES WITHOUT THAT ONGOING SUPPORT AND ESPECIALLY AS WE- LIKE I SAID REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE AN. ONGOING NEED WELL IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE CAN WORK WITH AS- I. THE AND THE MINUTE. TO MAKE THIS AN ONGOING OF FUNDING COUNTY. THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. THIS WAS- REALLY MAY CHAIN I AND HOW LIVE OUR GROUP FOSTER AND THAT INCLUDE NON RELATED PARENTS ARE WHAT WE- THOUGHT ABOUT. AS LICENSE FOSTER FAMILIES BUT ALSO FOR RELATIVE CAREGIVERS. HE CAN BE A SPONSORED LEGISLATION BEFORE THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT WHICH- MR FREITAS MENTIONED AT STARBUCKS IMPORTANT POINT TO THINK ABOUT IN OUR- RFA RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL CHANGE- LIFESPAN. WE HAVE SPONSORED LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE CONCEPT AND CREATED AS A PILOT IT WAS NOT SOMETIME WITH STATEWIDE- WAS NOT MANDATED FOR EVERY COUNTY TO DO IT. ADDITIONALLY THE REQUIREMENTS BEING PLACED UNDER RELATIVE CAREGIVERS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY DISCUSSED AT THAT TIME BECAUSE FEDERAL LAW HAD UP UNTIL THAT POINT ALLOWED US TO TREAT- RELATIVE CARE GIVERS AND LICENSE NON RELATED FOSTER PARENTS. SOMEONE DIFFERENTLY WHEN IT CAME TO WHETHER WE RELICENSING. ARE PROVING. AB WE SPONSORED WOULD JUST. THE PILOTS TOOK AWHILE TO GET OFTEN THEY WORK OFF THE GROUND AND THAT'S YOU SEE OUR- FEES HAPPENED IN TWENTY FOUR HE HOST TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. AND SO THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT PROPOSITION THIRTY IN OUR OPINION APPLIES TO THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL. AND SO UNFORTUNATELY COUNTIES ARE NOT FUNDED FOR THE RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL WE HAVE EACH YEAR BUT ABLE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND- THIS ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION. CAN'T RECEIVE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE ACTIVITIES- AND THIS YEAR WE DID RECEIVE ON A ONE TIME BASIS. EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND- IT WAS CALLED THE GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION FOR CWS WE DO- WE DO KNOW THAT COUNTIES ARE USING THESE FUNDS PRIMARILY THE OFFICE THAT. THE OTHERWISE UNFUNDED AREN'T THEY COST. THIS IS- I DON'T ONGOING DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND THE ADMINISTRATION I'LL JUST SAY- BUT WE KNOW HOW MUCH THIS IS COSTING OVER AND ABOVE. OUR EXPENDITURES PRIOR TO GOING STATEWIDE WITH RFA BECAUSE WE DO A- PROCESS WITH THE STATE. TO TRACK ALL OF OUR COSTS BEFORE AND AFTER SEIZE THE ARTS REQUIRED UNDER PROP THIRTY THAT WE DO THAT. AND SO IT'S COSTING COUNTIES A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER IN ABOUT THE LICENSING AND APPROVAL ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAD UNDERTAKEN HIGHER NEXT PARTY TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. PRIOR TO THE MANDATE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND SO WE ARE REQUESTING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WE'RE ASKING THAT THAT BE AN ONGOING INVESTMENT WE'RE ASKING THAT IT BE CALLED RFA. SO THAT WE KNOW THAT COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY FUNDED TO DO THE WORK AS WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE. IT'S AN IMPORTANT SHIFT. IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT IS A MUCH BETTER PROCESS ESPECIALLY FOR OUR RELIGION. THEY NOW GET TRAINING THEY GET- ACCESS TO MORE SERVICE THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY DID. WHEN WE WERE JUST DOING A SORT OF MORE CURSORY. AND NOT OF ON. SORT OF LICENSE TIGHT OF AGREE LIKE WE DO NOW. SO WE SUPPORT IT THERE'S NO WAY TO BACK OUT OF THE REMEDY UNDER PROP IS THIRTY IS TO JUST NOT DO THE THING THAT MANDATED. THERE'S REALLY NO WAY NOT TO DO THIS OR DON'T HAVE FOSTER. SO WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO I HAD. WORK TOGETHER. TO GET THIS FUNDED ON ON BY BASIS AND- BRACKET THAT IT IS A STATEWIDE MANDATE. HOW TWENTY RELY. ALTHOUGH AHEAD AND- STOP MY COMMENTS HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OF COURSE AND- LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REST OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S MOVED ON ON WITH THE CHRISTINE STONER MERTZ CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILDREN CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. THANK YOU SO MUCH HERE EGGMAN- TO THE-COMMITTEE- REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. ON HOW CAN THE STATE- BETTER CONNECTS YOUTH IN CARE TO FAMILIES AND ALSO WHAT SORTS OF FUNDING BY THE STATE BE CONSIDERING- IN TERMS OF DOING JUST THAT- I THINK IF I WANT TO START BY SAYING- YOU KNOW CULTURE EATS STRATEGY FOR BREAKFAST. AND WE STILL AREN'T QUITE THERE IN TERMS OF THE CULTURE WE'RE BUILDING- I THOUGHT THAT MISTER BLAYLOCK'S COMMENTS ABOUT HOW CRITICAL IT IS THAT SERVICES ARE COORDINATED LOCALLY. AND. AT THE STATE LEVEL OUR IS AT. ENGAGING FAMILIES AND GETTING THEM THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IT AND HAS MISSED-UNDERLING SAID. YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THE GET DEFINED BY FAMILIES MAYBE LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE PARTICULARLY THINK OF AS YOU KNOW THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS OR SERVICES FOR THE THINGS THAT WE CURRENTLY FUNDS SO. I THINK WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO ON THAT AND WE HAVE TO START WITH THE FAMILIES BEING AT THE TABLE. NOT JUST INVITED TO THE DINNER- WE HAVE TO CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT. WHICH MEANS SOMETMES WE HAVE EVENING MEETINGS WE DON'T DO THEM WHEN THEY'RE MOST CONVENIENT FOR YOU KNOW THE STAFF THAT ARE WORKING- WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT WE GET TO FAMILIES RATHER THAN EXPECTING THEM TO COME TO US AND WE'VE GOT TO BUILD SYSTEMS THAT TRULY NOT JUST INVITE THEM IN BUT MAKE THEM A CRITICAL DECISION MAKER IN THE PROCESS. THAT MEANS ENSURING THAT WERE USING COMMUNITY TO FIND SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT ENGAGE THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT ARE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY RESPONSIVE SO THEY FEEL NOT JUST INVITED BUT IN FACT WELCOMES TO THE PROCESS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO ENSURING THAT EVERY CHILD AND YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IS BEING ACTIVELY CONNECTED TO RELATIVES AND NATURAL SUPPORTS. WE SHOULD NOT AS A SYSTEM BE RAISING CHILDREN WE SHOULD BE INTERVENING AT POINTS WHERE FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING AND ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CONNECT TO USED TO THEIR PEOPLE MANY CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE HAVE ACCESS FAMILY FINDING AN ENGAGEMENT SERVICES. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT IS NOT. THIS TRACKED ON A STATEWIDE BASIS THAT I'M AWARE OF. WE DON'T REALLY EVEN HAVE A CLEAR WORKING DEFINITION OF WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE ON THE OUTRAGE THAT'S CURRENTLY REQUIRED IN LAW FIRST THIRTY DAYS THERE HAS TO BE THAT FAMILY FINDING. I THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO REALLY FIND AN ARRAY OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO CONNECT YOUTH IN CARE SO FAMILIES WHICH INCLUDES ACTUALLY FUNDING THE FAMILY FINDING AN ENGAGEMENT SERVICES- THE BASIC NEEDS FUNDING THAT MISTER BLAYLOCK TALKED ABOUT. THAT WOULD ALLOW FAMILIES TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN LIVE WITH THEM. BY PROVIDING THINGS LIKE- US ADICIONAL SUPPORTS OF A FAMILY NEEDS A LARGER SPACE. RESPITE CARE TO CARE GIVERS THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT MAY NOT. BE AVAILABLE AND SOME OF OUR STRUCTURES- WRAPAROUND SERVICES PROVIDED TO EVERY CHILD AND FAMILY ENGAGED IN CHILD WELFARE AGAIN DEFINED BY THE FAMILY NOT BY. OUR OWN FISCAL SYSTEMS. NOT BY WHAT'S MOST CONVENIENT FOR US BUT HOW THE FAMILY DEFINES WHAT THEY NEED- WE REALLY NEED FUNDING FOR SUPERVISED VISITATION FOR USE AND CARE. THIS IS OFTEN DONE. BY CASE WORKERS FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY IS WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT AND IF WE'RE REALLY PRIORITIZING THESE CONNECTIONS WITH FAMILY WE HAVE TO FUND ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT. MAKING AND MAINTAINING THOSE CONNECTIONS- THE PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS A GREAT START BUT IT'S JUST THAT IT'S A START. WE DESPERATELY TO FOR. VARIOUS FAMILY FINDING AN ENGAGEMENT THERE ARE SOME OTHER PROPOSALS- OF THAT WILL BE COMING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THAT DO JUST THAT AND SO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE CRITICAL BUT- WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FUND DOING THE SERVICES. WHETHERIT'S- AT THE COUNTY LEVEL OR AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL. EVERYONE SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN THAT SHOULD BE DOING IT SHOULD BE MAKING IT A PRIORITY AND WE HAVE TO FUND IT TYPES OF PROPOSALS. THE STATE HAS TO BUILD IN SOME ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT ENSURE THAT ALL YOU THINK HERE ARE CONNECTED TO FAMILY THIS INCLUDES. REQUIRING THAT CFTC'S SORRY CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THAT ACRONYM MUST HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS PRESENT. THERE HAS TO BE DOCUMENTATION THAT SOME OUTRAGE HAS OCCURRED IN THE EVENT THAT A FAMILY IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND WE HAVE TO CREATE WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORTS- THAT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES NEED TO WORK ON THAT RE ENGAGEMENT WHEN THEY'VE BEEN SEPARATED. OR TO REMAIN TOGETHER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. AND FINALLY I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT MENTION TAT WE THAT AS WE CELEBRATE THE REDUCTION OF YOUTH IN RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENTS. WHICH IS PHENOMENAL 60% IS I THINK PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANY STATE I'VE HEARD OF. WE ARE ALSO FACING A CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT CRISIS IS IMPACTING FOSTER YOUTH. ALONG WITH OTHER YOUTH- IF WE ARE STILL GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH THEIR FAMILY OR RETURNING THEM TO THEIR FAMILIES. WE HAVE TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDING THOSE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES. THAT HELP YOU STABILIZE AND RECONNECTED THEM WITH FAMILY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO PIECE TOGETHER FOR THE LONG TERM. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH- HE ADDED THAT CAN WORK IN A RESEARCH PROJECT BACK IN THE LATE NINETIES IN OREGON LOOKING AT THEIR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN THE SAME THINGS WE FOUND TO BE TRUE THEN CONTINUE TO BE TRUE NOW IF YOU GET FAMILIES WHAT THEY NEED TO KIND OF FIND OUT HOW THEY- DEFINE IT GOOD THINGS CAN HAPPEN- SO I THINK TO THAT THE DEPARTMENT I THINK EVERYONE. REALLY BELIEVES YOU'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- IN IN AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED- ENVIRONMENT- AND ASTRONOMERS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAID. THAT THE CULTURE STILL NEEDS TO CHANGE YOUR TALK ABOUT THE CULTURE OF. STATE AGENCY COUNTY AGENCIES OR- ALL OF THE ABOVE. FIVE I WOULD SAY PROBABLY ALL OF US HAVE TO. WORK ON THAT. YEAH MMHM. AND I AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOU IT'S VERY HARD TO TAKE A BUREAUCRACY. AND WRAP IT AROUND A LITTLE NIBBLE CHILD AND FAMILY'S LIVES- AND STILL BE THE BUREAUCRACY THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BE. SO THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT THINGS I APPRECIATE ALL THE INPUT YOU GAVE- AMASSED DR PAN FEE HAS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU OUR COMMENTS. HEALTH THANK YOU- ACTUALLY I DID A QUESTION FOR. SANDERLING DONALD- WITH CTW DA- SO YOU'RE YOU'RE SUGGESTING A HUNDRED MILLION FOR I GUESS THE FIRST- AND- YOU. KNOW WE HAVEN'T FUNDED FOR A COUPLE YEARS- SO CAN YOU JUST HELP ME QUALIFY- WILL. THE HUNDRED MILLION WOULD RECRUIT HOW MANY ADDITIONAL FOSTER FAMILIES- THAT- WE'RE NOT DOING NOW BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FUNDING FOR FIRST. I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION DOCTOR PAN I CAN'T ANSWER AT THE MOMENT AT ALL OKAY WHEN Y. I THINK IT'S HARD TO SAY X. NUMBER OF FAMILIES BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE DIVERSE FUNDS ISN'T JUST A MEDIA CAMPAIGN- YEAH MORE PEOPLE TO SIGN UP RIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S ALSO. REPORTS FINDING THOSE RELATIVES IN TEACHING THEM LIKE US ON OR JUST SAYING THAT ACTUALLY TAKES A LOT OF WORK I'VE- TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF THAT COUNTY STAFF WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE LOCALLY FOR DOING THAT FAMILIES FINDING. AND YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF DATA MINING YOU'RE NOT JUST LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN A COURT HEARING YOU'RE TRYING TO DO MORE CONVERSATIONS AND FIND OUT MORE THROUGH ANCESTRY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THEN YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO REACH OUT TO THEM MAKE CONTACT WITH THEM IN A WAY THAT THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU THEY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW IN SOME CASES IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND A RELATIVE- THEY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW. THAT THERE IS A CHILD AT ALL IN THEIR FAMILY OR A CERTAINLY THAT THE CHILD HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A REPORT OF A DECENT LIKE THAT CAN BE REALLY TRICKY AND SO THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE WITH THAT AND THEN TRYING TO ENGAGE IN THAT PERSON'S LIFE. EVEN IF WE DON'T END UP PLACING THE CHILD WITH THEM WE WANNA TRY TO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM WE MAY FIND MORE THAN ONE PERSON WHO'D BE A GOOD. PLACE FOR THE CHILD TO LIVE THEY ONLY LIVE IN ONE PLACE AND SO WE CAN TRY TO HELP GROW THOSE RELATIONSHIPS STUDENTS FUNDING- NOT JUST FIND. BURKE ABSOLUTE OF PROJECT PLACE SO THERE. A LOT THAT GOES INTO IT SOMETIME AT IT'S HARD TO. DO YOU YOU A NUMBER BUT I WELL WELL IT WAS OF THE WAY I MEAN I KNOW YOU. GIVE UP. NUMBER AND I WILL. I OF SERVICE YOU TALK ABOUT IS NOT KNOW IT'S NOT NEARLY PUTTING OUT ADS AND COUNTY COUNTY PEOPLE SAID YES I WILL. DO THIS- BUT I THINK WE WE'VE HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE. I'M JUST. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO. IDENTIFY THE METRICS IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW IF WE ROLL OUT THE PROGRAM WHETHER ONE TRACK OR NOT- AND YOU KNOW FRANKLY PEOPLE DO WANT. A BUDGET COMMITTEE ON SOME ACCOUNTABILITY SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT AT. LEAST WE SHOULD HAVE SOME TARGETS AS TO- YOU KNOW HOW. A WE'RE GOING TO A HUNDRED. DOLLARS MANY YOU KNOW HOW HOW MANY MORE KIDS- YOU KNOW FOSTER YOUTH ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. TO HAVE A FAMILY PLACEMENT AND- BETTER OR SOMETHING SO. I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO. HAVE SOME METRICS AS TO WHAT THE INVESTMENT SHOULD RESULT IN. AND WHETHER THERE'S INFORMATION FROM PAST THAT MIGHT HELP INFORM THAT ANY DIESELS NOT SIR LIKE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET EXACTLY YOU KNOW WHAT THE THREE HUNDRED OR SOMETHING X. NUMBER FAMILIES. BUT I THINK IT I THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME METRIC OF THE TERMS OF. OF A FOSTER YOUTH WOULD NOW HAVE YOU KNOW CERTAIN LEVEL PLACEMENT THAT CURRENTLY AREN'T OR SOMETHING TO THAT THAT THAT WITHOUT. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WE DOCTOR BE AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY POINT AT- AN AREA THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT MEMORY MENTIONED THERE'S ALL THESE DATA AVAILABLE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH MOVEMENT OF THE NEEDLE AS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IS JUST THE STRAIGHT UP. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE ARE WITH A RELIGION. RIGHT IF YOU BACK OUT THE GUARDIAN TOOK PLACE OF THE ADOPTIVE PLACEMENTS YEAH ALL OF THAT STUFF AND THE OTHER FAMILY TYPE OF SETTINGS. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND 42% IT'S GONE UP AND DOWN A LITTLE BIT OVER THE LAST. YOU KNOW EIGHT TO NINE YEARS NOW IT'S NOT REALLY GROWN AS MUCH AS I THINK WE HOPE. AND SO THAT MIGHT BE AN AREA TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND SEE. IF WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THAT NEEDLE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY AT THIS MANY MORE CHILDREN. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO I'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AND WITH THAT STAFF OF COURSE- DR POLK WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. I'M WE WORK WELL WITH AND SEE TO IT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE KIND OF THINK ABOUT THAT. AS WE LOOK AT TRYING TO MAKE THAT KIND OF THE LAST. OKAY NO THAT'S RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO REMIND PEOPLE THAT- THAT JUST BY THE RIGHT NUMBER RIGHT IT'S NOT GONNA BE A HUNDRED PERCENT. RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF WEATHER CIRCUMSTANCE AND OTHER REASONS- IT'S- CERTAINLY SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN ZERO. AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK IDENTIFYING THE TARGET RANGE SHALL AND KNOWING WHAT. DATA LEAD TO DATA FIND AT TARGET. AND IF THE CASE SOME OF THE SOME OF THOSE NUMBER THE BASELINE NUMBERS CHANGE THAT WOULD CHANGE A TARGET BUT I THINK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST SO THAT WE- HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND- WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS SO WE KNOW WHETHER MAKING. APPROPRIATE PROGRESS I THANK YOU. BUT MISTER MOORE TO PUT YOU SAY THE- CAL. IS DOING BEST A IT SIXTIES. PER I THINK I WAS REFERENCING THE REDUCTION IN IN CHILDREN RESIDENTIAL. CARE TEXAS OKAY AND IT'S AND IT'S 38% THAT WE HAVE WITH WITH FAMILY PLACEMENTS THAT RIGHT. TENDERING MCCONNELL ABOUT YEAH I THINK THAT'S ABOUT RATE CHANGES A TAD BIT FROM YOUR YOUR BECAUSE ALL THE NUMBERS SHIFT. JUST PUT SOME CONTEXT AROUND THAT 67% DROP- WHEN C. C. R. STARTED WE HAD 6% OF OUR CHILDREN PLACE TO CONGREGATE FACILITIES. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WAS THREE POINT 3% SO THAT'S HOW YOU SEE THAT VERY LARGE YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT DROP- AND IT'S INTERESTING CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY QUITE LOW IN CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS PERCENTAGES. COMPARED TO A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES WHEN WE WERE DOING SOME WORK NATIONALLY ON THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT THAT WAS SPOKEN ABOUT EARLIER IN THAT- IN THE HEARING I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATES THAT HA. DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGES OF CHILDREN CONGREGATE THEY SPENT. SO EVEN THOUGH THERE IS ROOM ABSOLUTELY AND CERTAINLY THINKING ABOUT SHORTENING THE LENGTH OF STAY AND MAKING SURE THAT THE SERVICES ARE BROUGHT TO BEAR MORE QUICKLY AND MORE ROBUSTLY- WE DON'T HAVE AS FAR TO GO I'D SAY AS WE'VE SEEN IN SOME OTHER STATES. BUT STILL ALWAYS IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE A PART. THANK YOU ALL THINK YOUR MUCH FOR YOUR WORK THANK YOU ALL FOR THE PRESENTATION AND THANK YOU FOR THE DEDICATION. EVERY SINGLE DAY TO HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE THE CHILD CARE PROPOSAL.

THAT THAT MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. ILIO GOOD AFTERNOON OUT OF MEMBERS ARE GOOD WITH THE THAT ABOUT OFFICE ARE I THINK I WAS AT THE PUMP A OF A OVERVIEW OF THE TWENTY ONE TWO BUDGET ACTION THAT I THINK- YES HI MY NAME AND THE CENTER EXIT TALK ABOUT BOTH WITHIN THERE WAS IN THE BUDGET ACT AND THE- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGETS ALL JUST FOCUS OUR COMMENTS ON- BUT- OUR REVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSAL. WE DID IT ONE THAT NO ONE ISSUE REGARDING THE FUNDING FOR OUR GENERAL HEALTH CARE OR CTR- FOR THE SLOTS THAT WERE PROVIDED- INITIALLY IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ACT INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR FORTY SIX THOUSAND NO GENERAL TUCKER SLOTS IN THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING WAS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SLOTS WOULD BE RELEASED ON APRIL FIRST TWENTY ONE APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THAT'S TWENTY THREE THREE MONTHS WORTH OF FUNDING DURING THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. ARE THERE ANYWAY THE COST OF THE SLOTS FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NEED TO SENSE A QUADRUPLE- FUNDING TO GO FROM THREE MONTHS WITH A FUNDING FOR TWELVE MONTHS WITH THE FUNDING- SO THIS WOULD REQUIRE A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- DIED MINISTRATION TWENTY TO TWENTY BUDGET HOWEVER ONLY PROVIDES FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THE FULL THE FOR YOUR CALL THREE SLOTS THAT'S THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS LAST AND WE WOULD'VE EXPECTED. ON BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL% SERVICES THIS IS DUE TO A CHANGE IN METHODOLOGY OF HOW THEY ARE CALCULATING THE COST PER GENERAL CHUCK TUCKER SLOT I'M WOULD YOU BRING WITH YOUR ATTENTION ANOTHER TO MEET- TECHNICAL REASONS WHY WOULD MAKE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS BUT BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE OF IMPLEMENTATION THIS WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY BUDGET AGREEMENT- WITH THIS CHANGE AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY THIS RESULTS IN BUT MINISTRATION ONLY PROVIDING UP 260% OF THE FUNDING FOR GENERAL CHALKER THAT WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED BASED. ON THE TWENTY ONE TO BUDGET AGREEMENT. I'M MORE STILL CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE OTHER. OPERABLE- SPEND CHANGES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BY RELATED CHILD CARE ANY ISSUES THAT WE BE IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHT- AND BACK. MY COMMENT I HAVE BEEN THIRTY FIRST. THANK YOU VERY. DURING JOHNSON A ARRAY TO ABOUT THE- THAT THREE HUNDRED. NINE AS THE- THE DIFFERENT COUNTY. I CHECK MANTISES GARRISON TORN APART IN A FINANCING PACKAGE TO RESPECT TO THAT ISSUE- AS MR PEROT HAD NOTED- THAT THE DIFFERENCE AND SORT OF EXPECTATION THAT THE L. A. WITH EXPECTING FOR THE COSTS RELATED TO THE SPOTS. IS REALLY- IN TECHNICAL IN NATURE AND DUE TO A TWICE A METHODOLOGY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MADE- WHERE WE'RE INTENDING TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN MAINTAINING COMMITMENTS AND THE NUMBER SPOT TO GREET YOU AND AVAILABLE ACROSS BUDGET WINDOW AND- TO APPROPRIATING FUNDING. BASED ON ACTUAL PRODUCTIVE UTILIZATION I'M JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO ADHERE TO THE COMMITMENTS MADE IN THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET BACK. AND WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN TO ENGAGING WITH L. A. O. AND THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER OTHER BUDGET METHODOLOGY SUPPORT PROVIDE. REQUISITE FUNDING IN NINETEEN COMMITMENTS. SOME OF THE MOST RECENT IS SO. IS THE L. A. O. ESTIMATE THAT ONLY SEE PERCENT OF THE SLOTS INTENDED BY. THE ADMINISTRATION AND FUNDED BY THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ABLE TO BE FULFILLED. YES IT IS OUR INTENT TO MAINTAIN THOSE THOSE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND SLOTS AND ENCOURAGE YOUR WITH THAT THE RAMP UP OVER THAT THE BUDGET WINDOW THAT WAS AGREED TO LAST YEAR SO WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH LEN THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH. TO BUDGET AT THE BACK COMMITMENT. SO WOULD YOU SAY THIS IS A- AN EXAMPLE OF THE LAST PANELS TALKING ABOUT THAT WE STILL LIVE IN SILOS AND IF WE LIVE IN SILOS ABOUT HOW WE CALCULATE PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES FROM ONE DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER AND I AND I WANNA. HIGHLIGHT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS DEPARTMENT HAS JUST- DIVISION HAS JUST RECEIVED THIS NEW RESPONSIBILITY AND SO I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A- IT'S A COMPLEX- BUT IS THIS AN EXAMPLE OF SILOS NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER OR HOW COULD HE- A MISTAKEN CALCULATION HAVE RESULTED IN. THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION AND 60% OF SLIDES. I WENT YESTERDAY TO YOUR POINT ABOUT ABOUT THE AND THE TRANSITION OF THESE PROGRAMMES THAT AND THE COMPLEXITY THAT THERE YOU KNOW WERE ANSWERED IN A LEARNING PERIOD ABOUT HOW WITH THE PROSPECTS TO PURCHASE THAT THIS IS THE PARTS WE TOOK WORK FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT- AGAIN WE APPRECIATE- THAT THEY OFFER SOME LEGISLATURE AND BUT THE L. A. O. TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE SINCE WE CAN CONCEPT YOU KNOW AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO MAINTAIN. A COMMITMENTS LAST YEAR. OKAY SO THEN MY ASSUMPTION IS WE'RE GONNA COME BACK IN AND VISIT THIS AGAIN. THEM BEFORE I MEAN CERTAINLY WELL BEFORE. WE PASSED THE BUDGET SO WE CAN GET A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH MONEY IT'S GOING TO COST. AND HOW MANY SLOTS WILL BE FUNDED- AND IF WE GO INTO- THEN ADJUSTING THE RAIDS. DOES THAT IS THAT GOING TO IS THAT GOING TO FURTHER COMPLICATE- THE AMOUNT OF. THE DEBT IN THE AMOUNT OF SLOTS THAT WERE ABLE TO FIND. FOR A SECOND OR DOES IT DOOR DOES IT FURTHER THE- DISPARITY IN FUNDING FUNDING METHODOLOGIES. I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK THAT THE SORT OF THE- MULTIPLE SORT OF EFFORTS THAT WERE THAT WERE PROCEED THROUGH THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT IT DOESN'T- ADDED COMPLICATION WORK WE'RE DEALING WITH WITH MULTIPLE EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING ADDRESS- PROCEED AT THE SAME TIME- RIGHTS ACT- I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID ENGAGE ON AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO LOOK AT LIKE HOW. HOW WERE- AT REVISING THE- THE RATES EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY ALONGSIDE THE INCREASE IN SPOTS AND AN ESTIMATE AGAIN WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR- ON THE OFFER FROM LA- AND LEGISLATURE TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND ENGAGE JUST AS WE REVISIT GOING INTO- FOR THE REVISION FONG ABOUT. WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT AN APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENT MIGHT BE. OKAY THIRTY PARA. THANK YOU AND- I GUESS IT'S JUST ONE OF THE SITES WITH CHAIR ALSO SAID NGUYEN FIRST OF ALL I THINK WE NEED TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT AND I WAS THE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT SUM OF MONEY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AS- IN A WERE. GETTING THROUGH CODED HAND- ALL AND- PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO RETURN TO WORK AND SO FORTH AND EVEN LOCAL IT'S NOT GONE AWAY YOU KNOW WE- WE CAN. PEOPLE WELL THIS IS WHY WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY WOMEN WHO AREN'T ABLE TO REENTER THE WORKFORCE IT IS A CHILD CARE SO- SO AND SO REALLY APPRECIATE THE PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS WE NEED HONOR THEM. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO BUDGET FOR THAT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE SLOTS ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT- PEOPLE. CAN DO THINGS THEY- NEED TO DO AND- ALSO THAT HELPS WITH- THE FAMILIES AND HELP THE ECONOMY SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING BACK FROM EVERYONE. THAT HOW TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK- I THINK WE COULD SAY THAT IT'S A PRIORITY THAT WE FIND FUNDUS AND THAT WAS A PRIOR COMMITMENT SO LET'S BE SURE WE KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER IS. THANK YOU. OKAY I APPRECIATE EVERY HARD WORK AND SOUNDS LIKE WE GOT A LITTLE BIT BASED MORE TO GO AND SO WILL. WE WILL WE WILL KEEP WORKING ON THAT- THINK EVERYBODY FOR YOUR WORK AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE.

I CAN'T WILL EXPAND FURTHER ON THE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN THE FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE EXPERIENCE- CHILD CARE PROVIDERS OPENING CLOSING DURING- COLBY- WE'RE I HAPPEN AT A ATE I WANT TO SHARE A STORY WITH YOU OFF FROM A PROVIDER THAT I SHARED THIS STORY WITH ME- THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A CHILD CARE PROVIDER THROUGH THE PANDEMIC BECAME VERY DEVASTATING BECAME VERY DEVASTATING AS A ROLL MAN TWINBILL. WHILE ALSO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE MONEY- AND FUNDING WAS COMING FROM IT WAS COMING AT ALL. HOW TO SUSTAIN STAFF THAT CAN LEAD. AND MAIN. BILLS REPLIED THAT YOU IT HAS HER LOW. POINT OF BEING A CHILD PROVIDER. SHE HAS BEEN IN SHOCK PROVIDER LEASING GENTLEMEN FOR OUR TO SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE- STAFFING SHORTAGES RIGHT ACCORDING TO THE CENTER OF CHILD CARE EMPLOYMENT NATIONALLY THE CHILDCARE INDUSTRY IS STILL DOWN A HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND JOBS SINCE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY. LOW WAGES AREONE OF THE MAIN REASONS PROVIDERS PREDOMINANTLY BLACK IN LATIN NEXT WOMEN. ARE LEAVING THE CHILD CARE INDUSTRY AND NOT ENTERING THE PROFESSION AT ALL. I WANT TO PROVIDE ANOTHER TESTIMONIAL FROM A CHILD CARE PROVIDER. YOU SHARE WITH ME THAT SHE HAS EXTREME DOES EXTREME DIFFICULTY FINDING AN ASSISTANT TO HELP OUR DAY TO DAY- PREVIOUS ASSISTANT NOT DUE TO- HER PEER FOR HOME HEALTH. IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC. THIS CHILDCARE PROVIDER HAS BEEN SEARCHING TO FILL THE VACANCY SINCE TWENTY TWENTY AND A HALF HAS HAD NO LUCK. IS IT HAS FORCED HER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT CHILDREN SHE SERVES SHE WENT FROM PROVIDING TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE TO TWELVE HOUR CARE EVERY DAY. OUR INCOME AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY MORE THAN HALF. AND SHE IS UNFORTUNATELY A PLAN SHE'S IMPORTANT PLANNING ON LEAVING THE BILL BEFORE THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SHE HAS BEEN A CHILD CARE PROVIDER FOR OVER THIRTY TWO YEARS IN OUR COMMUNITY. ASK YOU ALL TO REFLECT ON THEIR DISPOSITION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO- IMAGINE DISPOSITION APPARENTLY KNEW AND EVEN SEASON OR PERSPECTIVE. HOW CARE PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE MAY BE. ENCLOSING WE MUST TAKE A STEP BACK. AND CONSIDER THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED IT IS CLEAR. THE LACK OF CHILDCARE IS DIRECTLY IMPACTING WOMEN'S ABILITY TO RETURN. TO THE WORKFORCE. FOR ALL OF LABOUR'S THE TO. GARY'S CHOPPER. THE ECONOMY RECOVERED. FOR MANY. ACCORDING TO THE NAY. WOMEN'S LAW CENTER WINNING GAINED A HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND JOBS IN JANUARY. BUT WERE STILL OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION JOBS SHORT SINCE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY. THE PROBLEM IS EVEN WORSE FOR BLACK WOMEN AND LIVE NEXT WOMEN IN OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. I'LL SURELY STATISTICS NEARLY ONE IN SEVENTEEN BLACK WOMEN AGES TWENTY AND OVER JUST FIVE POINT 8% WERE UNEMPLOYED IN JERRY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. DOWN FROM SIX POINT 2% IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NEARLY ONE IN TWENTY LIVE NEXT WOMEN AGES TWENTY AND OVER- FOUR POINT 9% WERE UNEMPLOYED IN JANUARY TWENTY SECOND TWO. I'M CHANGE FROM DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY COMPARISON. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR WHITE MEN AGES TWENTY AND OVER WAS THREE POINT 2% IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO UP FROM 3% DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IS STARKLY BUT CHAO K. INDUSTRY HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS ADAPTABILITY AND REMEMBER NEXT ENSURE OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE SERVED. HOWEVER WE ARE NOW AT AN INFLECTION POINT WHERE CHILD CARE WHILE WHERE THE CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE CANNOT HOLD MUCH LONGER AT THIS RATE. IN ITS FRAGILITY HAS EXISTED OVER DECADES. THE PANDEMIC HAS NOT ONLY EXACERBATED HISTORICAL RACIAL INEQUITIES BUT HAS CREATED NEW ONES WE MUST MAKE THESE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. AND THE REPERCUSSIONS BECOME EVEN GREATER OUR COMMUNITY THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND I YIELD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR BLAKELY- MISTER CALDERON. CFO. EARLY CHILDHOOD DISCOVERY CENTERS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CENTERS MY NAME IS KEN HERE I'M A CO OWNER AND CFO OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DISCOVERY SAM CENTERS IN SELMA ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES SOUTH OF. FRESNO I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND PARTICULARLY CENTER EGGMAN FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU- MYSELF MY WIFE AND MY SISTER IN LAW OPERATE FOR PRESCHOOL CENTERS ALL IN SELMA. THE FIRST ONE BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN THE LAST ONE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. SOME IS A MODERATE INCOME CITY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 80% OF POPULATION IS STATIC WELL PERCENT WHITE 7% JABI. AND 1% OTHER ALL OF OUR CENTERS ARE FUNDED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM CONTRACTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. PROXIMALLY A THIRD OF OUR CHILDREN ARE CLASSIFIED AS THE LANGUAGE LEARNERS. WE CAN USUALLY GET PRIVATE PAY FAMILIES TO PAY THE SAME RATE AS THE STATE PAYS US. HOWEVER THERE ARE VERY FEW AND MOST FAMILIES AND MOST OF OUR TEACHERS SADLY QUALIFY FOR OUR SUBSIDIZE- REGIONAL PROGRAM. YEAH COULD NOT ECONOMIC BASE FOR SELMA AS WITH MOST SMALL TOWNS AND CITIES IN THE VALLEY AS AGRICULTURE. AND MANY OF OUR FAMILIES WILL HAVE AT LEAST ONE PARENT EITHER WORKING IN THIS FIELD OR IN PROCESS PLANTS. YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED DO YOU KNOW HOW WE FARED DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND HONESTLY WE HAVE BEEN VERY BLESSED IN THAT REGARD. TWO YEARS AGO OUR GOVERNOR DISPLAYED THE LEADERSHIP THAT WAS SORELY LACKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU SHUT DOWN OUR STATE TO PROTECT THE TWENTY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THE EXPERTS THOUGHT WOULD OTHERWISE GET INFECTED AND OVERWHELM MEDICAL ASSISTANT AND I WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE. EXCEPT WHEN HE CAME TO THE PART ABOUT SCHOOLS BEING SHUT TO PREVENT THE SPREAD BUT NOT CHILD CARE CENTERS. MY WIFE AND I WERE SCARED SCARED FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND WE WONDERED WHY DO YOU THINK KEEPING CHILD CARE CENTERS OPEN WON'T ALSO LEAD TO THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. WE QUICKLY REEVALUATED AND CAME TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS OUR CENTERS TO BE. HE SOCIETY THE SAY OPEN AND TRY TO CARE FOR THE CHILDREN. OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND THAT'S HOW WE APPROACH THEM WITH OUR EMPLOYEES IT WAS NOT A DISCUSSION THE MATTER THEY WERE EXPECTED TO BE AT WORK AND THEY CAME TO WORK. IT WAS SCARY AT FIRST I REMEMBER AN INSTANCE EARLY ON WHEN WE LEARNED THAT A CHILD WASN'T COMING TO SCHOOL THAT DAY BECAUSE HE TESTED POSITIVE. AND ONE OF OUR TEACHERS RIGHT THERE BURST INTO TEARS. SHE REACHED DOWN AND TIED THAT SHOOT THAT KIDS SHOES THE DAY BEFORE. AND SHE HAD A ONE YEAR OLD AT HOME AND SHE WAS SCARED. I SEE THAT WE WERE BLESSED DURING HIS ON GOING ON OKAY NINETEEN DOWN DOWN BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE BRIEF CLOSURE DURING THIS TIME. MOST OF OUR TEACHERS HAVE BEEN INFECTED IT SEEMS LIKE ABOUT HOUSES WERE SECOND JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND THE OTHER HALF OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. EVEN WITH THE VACCINE MANDATE THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE IN AUGUST. FORTUNATELY WELL A NUMBER OF TEACHERS HEADS HAVE HAD SOME PRETTY SERIOUS SYMPTOMS ONLY ONE AND HER HUSBAND. WERE HOSPITALIZED AND THEY RECOVERED FULLY. HOWEVER THE OMICRON VERY IS REALLY HAMPERING OUR ABILITY TO STAY FULLY STAFFED. MY WIFE NEEDED TO WORK IN THE CLASSROOM YESTERDAY AND SHE'LL BE AND ONCE HE'S IN ONE TODAY THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE OF TEACHERS OUT WITH PROGRAM. THE THING THAT IS SAVED AS FINANCIALLY DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS BEEN THE STATE FUNDING OUR CONTRACTOR FULL REGARDLESS OF OUR ENROLLMENT OR ATTENDANCE. SOMETHING REFERRED TO AS THE HOLD HARMLESS. WITH DRASTICALLY REDUCED CLASS AND GROUP SIZES BEING DICTATED BY THE PANDEMIC AND WITH ALL THE CLEANING AND ADDED SAFETY PROTOCOLS THAT REQUIRE MORE STAFF TIME AND COST. WE NEED ALL THE STAFF WE GET EVEN WITH YOUR KIDS IN THE CLASSROOMS. NOW DUE TO THE OPENING UP OF OUR STATE AND THE DROPPING OF MASK MANDATES WE ARE CLEARLY GOING TO TRY TO LIVE WITH. AS WE DO WITH OTHER DISEASE. HOWEVER IT STILL MAKES PEOPLE SICK KIDS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AWAY FROM SCHOOL. BBC COALITION IS REQUESTING A CONTINUATION OF THIS HOLD HARMLESS FOR ANOTHER YEAR. AS WE ARE NO DOUBT GOING TO HAVE ONGOING VARIANTS THAT WILL MAKE CLASSROOMS AND FILL THEM WITH KIDS. WHICH BRINGS ME NOW TO THE NEWEST AND BIGGEST THREAT FOR CENTERS AND THAT IS STAFF. IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS WE'VE LOST THREE TEACHERS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD BE BECAUSE THEY CATER TWELVE WORLD PAYS MUCH BETTER. NOW THAT TRANSITIONAL CAN YOU'RE GONNA GUARD HAS BEEN GREEN LIGHTED SQUAD RUBLE IN SIZE IN LITTLE OVER THREE YEARS FROM NW. AND EXPERTS SAY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND UTK TEACHERS OVER THOSE THREE. YEARS AN OBVIOUS STRATEGY IS FOR THEM TO GO AFTER THE WORK FORCE AND ALREADY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH. T. K. H. HERE. OUR WORK FOR. RCS PPG. I LITERALLY HEARD ON JUNE. THAT THAT IS GREAT STRATEGY TO GO AFTER SCHOOL THIS. I HAVE THREE MORE TEACHERS WHO ARE PREGNANT WITH SPRING AND SUMMER BABIES AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME JUST GETTING APPLICANTS TO REPLACE THEM AND FULLY STAFFED FOR OUR CENTERS. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN POSSIBLY RETAIN TEACHERS BY UPPING THEIR PAY AND BENEFITS AND THE ONLY WE CAN WE CAN DO THAT AS WITH HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR CENTERS. AS YOU KNOW IN CONCERT WITH THE BOW TO EXPAND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATORS ALSO APPROVE SOMETHING CALLED RATE REFORM FOR INDUSTRY. AND TOOK A STEP OF CONVERTING A REIMBURSEMENT RATE HE TO CSPD CONTRACTORS TO ONE BASED ON A ON REGIONAL MARKET RATES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORTED OUT OF A SENSE OF FAIRNESS. AS OBVIOUSLY HIGH COST REGIONS IN THE SATE SHOULD BE PAID HIGHER RATES THAN LOW CASARES OF THE STATE I SUPPORTED WITH THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR CONTRACTORS SUCH AS US. BASED ON THE HIGHER QUALITY AND HIGHER STAFFING RATIOS WE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AS A TITLE FIVE CONTRACTOR AS SOON AS AN EXAMPLE CSV CONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ONE ADULT IN THE CLASSROOM FOR EVERY EIGHT CHILDREN. BUT THE REGIONAL MARKET RATES THAT REPRESENT WHAT PRIVATE CONTRACTORS ARE CHARGED ARE BASED ON STAFFING RATIOS OF ONE ADULT FOR TWELVE CHILDREN. WHICH IS 50% LESS CHAP CLASSROOM STABBING. THEM WHAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN. AB WORKGROUP AS BEEN CAN BE CONVENE TO HELP FIGURE OUT WHAT THE QUALITY ADJUSTMENT SHOULD BE. HOWEVER NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT THIS RATE DISPARITY FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND THE WORK GROUP'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS WILL COME IN AUGUST OR IN THE FALL. SO THIS DISPARITY WILL CONTINUE FOR A SEPARATE YEAR NEXT YEAR. IF NOTHING ELSE IS DONE IN THE MEANTIME. ACCORDINGLY THE EASY CORE COALITION IS REQUESTING A 20% RATE INCREASE FOR THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR WHICH WOULD HELP IMMENSELY. BOSTON THE MORE COSTLY STAFF STAFFING RATIOS WE'RE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN COMPARED WITH PRIVATE PROVIDERS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR KEEPING YOUR DOORS OPEN REALLY A KNOWLEDGE IT AND APPRECIATE IT AND I CAN ONLY. HE TO YOU TOOK ME BACK TO HOW AFRAID WE ALL WERE- AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE A CHILD CARE WORKER AND SOME OF THAT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH- THINKING ABOUT.

LET'S HEAR NOW FROM KIMBERLY ROSENBERGER FROM SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION OR SEIU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD CARE WORK FORCE AND THE STATUS OF OUR JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES- I I'M PRESENTING TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDER UNITED WHICH IS A U. D. W. I. C. I. U. COLLABORATION- WHILE WE HAVE RECENTLY MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN CHILD CARE AS DEBORAH STORY HIGHLIGHTED WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO APPROPRIATELY SUPPORT WORK FORCE. ONLY BEGAN ORGANIZING CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WE WERE LOOKING AT A WORK FORCE OF WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS BY TWENTY NINETEEN PROVIDERS WON THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING JEREMY LESSEM FORTY THOUSAND WORKERS. THE PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED THAT OUR CHILD CARE WORKFORCE IS NOT OPERATING ON THE STRONG FOUNDATION. THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. CURRENTLY THEY CANNOT DO THEIR JOBS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING NOT ONLY THEIR OWN LIVELIHOODS BUT IN MANY CASES THEIR OWN LIVES. THE HISTORIC INFLUX OF STATE REVENUE IN YOUR HELP. WE CAN TURN THIS AROUND. FOR THIS FEMALE DOMINATED WORK FORCE. LAST YEAR WITH THE SUPPORTOF THE LEGISLATURE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS RATIFIED THEIR FIRST UNION CONTRACT. PART OF THIS HISTORIC AGREEMENT FORM NINE JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE. THANK RECALL OF THESE COMMITTEES.

CCQ IS GLAD TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THIS WORK TO GET THE LEGISLATURE INFORMATION TO BEST MAKE IMMEDIATE AND MEANINGFUL INVESTMENTS IN THE PROPOSAL SET FORTH. THE COST REPRESENTING OUR OWN.

IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF A THREE DAY ON SEES. INVESTMENTS WILL BE NEEDED. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IDEALLY IN THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUDGET ACT. INACTION THESE CUTE CREMINS. ONCE REGIONAL COMMITTEES. WILL ENSURE THAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CONSERVATOIRE EDUCATION CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO KEEP PARENTS WORKING IN CHILDREN FIVE. AND TOOK TO THE BACK. TO KEEP THEM IN THE EARLY CHILD CARE CHILD CARE INDUSTRY- AND NOT LEAVING FOR K. TO TWELVE WHICH DOES HAVE A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE. BUT ALSO WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED HERE. STARTING WITH HEALTHCARE MORE THAN 50% OF OUR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SURVEY REPORTED DELAYED OR POSTPONED MEDICAL TREATMENT DUE TO LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE. OR BEING UNDER INSURED. 20% REPORTED BEING UNINSURED AND UNABLE TO AFFORD THE MOST. BASIC PLAN THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. OUR CURRENT AS- IS TO HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION WHICH WOULD PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE PROVIDERS OVER TWO YEARS. RETIREMENT IS ALSO A KEY ISSUE MORE THAN 90% OF FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SURVEYED REPORTED NOT HAVING THE MEANS TO SAVE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND PER RETIREMENT OVER THEIR LIFETIME. MUCH LESS SAVING ENOUGH FOR THEM PREVENT THEM FROM RETIRING INTO POVERTY. WELL EXPERTS ADVISE A RETIREE SHOULD PLAN TO COVER EXPENSES OF FORTY THOUSAND A YEAR THAT WOULD MEAN HAVING SAME ONE MILLION BY AGE SIXTY FIVE TO ENABLE THEIR BENEFITS TO LAST UNTIL AGE NINETY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. OUR MEMBERS ARE NOWHERE NEAR STAVING ENOUGH FOR JUST ONE YEAR LET ALONE TWENTY FIVE. OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION TO ENROLL ELIGIBLE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN A FOUR FIFTY SEVEN B. RETIREMENT PLAN. THAT HELPS ME PROVIDERS HOLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BUILD RETIREMENT SAVINGS TO TWO YEARS OF BEING UNDERPINNED BY THE STATE.

A MALE OF DOLLARS HAVE STAYED IN A BANK ACCOUNT OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WORK CHARTS OR ANYTHING ALL OF THEM EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL LIBERTY AND MORE STABILITY THROUGH ON ONE OF THE MOST UNCERTAIN TIME IN OUR HISTORY.
