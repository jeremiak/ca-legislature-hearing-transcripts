TWENTY FIVE COOKERY. HOUSE RESOLUTION TWENTY FIVE BY SOME REMEMBER GONZALEZ RELATIVE TO SAYS THEIR SHOP AS DAY. GONZALEZ THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AS CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I RISE TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY FIVE WHICH IT KNOWLEDGE'S THE LIFE AND LEGACY ASSESSOR EACH CHAVEZ. SENSOR CHAVEZ WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST LABOR LEADERS OF OUR GENERATION OR MAYBE THE GENERATION BEFORE OURS FOR SOME OF US. CENTER TRAVIS IS WIFE SIR IT'S AN EXTREMELY SIMPLE HOW ONE PERSON CAN HAVE SUCH A HUGE IMPACT ON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND -- I LIKE MANY OF YOU ATTENDED A NUMBER OF EVENTS IN HONOR SAYS OR CHAVEZ. AND I ALWAYS ENJOY THESE EVENTS. BUT SOMETIMES IT SEEMS THAT WE SANITIZE HISTORY IN A WAY THAT FITS OUR OWN LIKING. AND SO WE HEAR ABOUT SAYS ARE CHAVEZ BEING A GREAT EDUCATIONAL LEADER A CIVIL RIGHTS ICON. SOMEBODY WHO CARED ABOUT ANIMALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE. MAKE NO MISTAKE. FIRST IN FOUR MONTHS CENTER TRAVIS WAS A LABOR LEADER. HIS ENTIRE GOAL OF ORGANIZING WAS TO PROTECT WORKERS. AND NOT JUST ANY WORKERS THE MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IN OUR NATION. WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF DEBATES ON FARMWORKERS ON THIS FLOOR SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS A PRETTY HISTORY WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. BECAUSE FARMWORKERS IN FACT DID COME. FROM PLANTATIONS IN SLAVERY. IN EVOLVED INTO A PAID A PROFESSION ALTHOUGH HISTORICALLY IN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE NOT TREATED EQUALLY. IN MOST STATES THEY STILL DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO MINIMUM WAGE. BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE DONE BETTER AND WE'VE DONE BETTER BECAUSE OF THE WORK ASSESSOR CHAVEZ IN STARTING THE UNITED FARM WORKERS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES. OF HIS COALITION BUILDING WITH FILIPINO FARM WORKER LEADERS TO STRIKE AND DEMANDS MORE IN. NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE TO THE CREATION OF THE A. R. B. IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO THE DEMAND THAT MINIMUM WAGE APPLY TO FARMWORKERS IN JUST A FEW YEARS AGO ON THIS FLOOR. THE FINAL DEMAND AFTER FORTY YEARS TO ENSURE THAT FARMWORKERS FINALLY AND THIS YEAR WE'RE FINALLY SEEING THE RESULT OF THIS WELL ACTUALLY GET. OVER TIME AFTER AN EIGHT HOUR DAY LIKE EVERY OTHER WORKER. TODAY I ASK THAT YOU HONOR THAT'S OUR JOB AS NOT JUST AS SOMEBODY WHO WHO IS GREAT. IN THE HISTORY BOOKS BECAUSE HE SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND THE CROSS SEXUALITY OF OUR PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT. BUT BECAUSE HE FOUGHT FOR WORKERS AND WE STILL NEED THAT KIND OF FIGHT TODAY. ALTHOUGH NOT ALL WORKERS IN THE SAME POSITION AS FARMWORKERS WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT STILL DON'T ENJOY THE SAME RIGHTS AS YOU AND I THE RIGHT TO MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME. THE RIGHT TO FEET PAID FAMILY LEAVE OR SICK DAYS. THE RIGHT TO WORKERS COMPENSATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SO THAT FIGHT CONTINUES TODAY. AND MY FAVORITE QUOTE MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM SAYS HER CHAVEZ. IS ONE THAT TALKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HONORING SOMEBODY SOMETHING WE ALL ARE. WILLING TO DO. AND DOING SOMETHING. HE SAID TALK IS CHEAP. IT'S THE WAY WE ORGANIZE AND USE OUR LIVES EVERY DAY. THAT TELLS WHAT WE BELIEVE IN WELL. I BELIEVE IN WORKERS AND SO IT'S AN HONOR TO STAND TODAY. TO HIGHLIGHT. A MAN. AN ICON. WHO ALSO BELIEVED IN WORKERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE? MR MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. IN SUPPORT OF HR. TWENTY FIVE SAYS ARE CHAVEZ WAS A HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER WHO BROUGHT DIGNITY TO THE LABOR FORCE. ON CALIFORNIA FARMS. HE EMPOWERED AN ENTIRE NONVIOLENT MOVEMENT THAT STOOD FOR EQUALITY AND JUSTICE. SAYS ARE CHAVEZ WAS ALSO AN INSPIRATION TO THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. AT THE RISE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA. THE OPPRESSION OF LET YOU KNOW FARMWORKERS VIOLATED JEWISH LAW. AND JEWISH VALUES.

HELLO AND HOW TO CORRECT HER SISTER AND SAY THAT'S NOT RE BE THAT'S RABBI. ALL THOSE CHECKS COMING FROM RABBIS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. RABBI JOSEPH BLASIER EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL CONFERENCE OF AMERICAN RABBIS AT THE TIME SAID THAT AMERICAN JEWS SHOULD NOT BY TABLE GRAPES. SO THEY ARE KOSHER. TELL THE PEOPLE WHO STOOP AND SQUAT AND GO THROUGH ALL KINDS OF HELP. OUT THERE IN THE FIELDS WERE TREATED RIGHT. THOSE GRAPES ARE NOT KOSHER. ACTIVE IS DRIVEN BY JUDAISM'S TEACHING OF SOCIAL JUSTICE SOUGHT TO IMPROVE RACIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUALITY TO MIGRANT FARM WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. I HAD THE HONOR AND THE PRIVILEGE TO MARCH WAS SAYS A JARVIS. BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE I MARCH FROM THESE VERY STEPS TO MODESTO. TO TO BOYCOTT GALLO WINE AT THE TIME.

DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE. BLACK CAUCUS WE'RE HONORED TO HONOR CESA CHAVEZ ON HIS DAY. A DAY THAT WE THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE MLK DAY IN TERMS OF PROVIDING IT INDIVIDUALS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK HARD TO BRING CHANGE. WITH KNOWLEDGE ACESSO CHAVEZ FOR WHAT HE GAVE US WHICH WAS COURAGE. COURTESY BEYOND THE CURRENT SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO ENVISION A WORLD THAT DID NOT EXIST AT THE TIME. IT TOOK COURAGE TO SACRIFICE HIS OWN LIFE HIS OWN CAREER. FOR THOSE WHO STOOD A NEED FOR PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE POOR AND POWERLESS AND SOME FOLKS EYES AT TO TREMENDOUS COURAGE. IT TOOK COURAGE TO LIVE ONE'S COMMITMENT TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO ACHIEVE WHAT WAS NECESSARY IN THE FEELS. AND TO GIVE THEM A LEADER AND A VOICE THAT WAS UNAFRAID. AND OBVIOUSLY TOOK COURAGE TO WALK WITH DELIVERANCE AND SIMPLY TAKE ACTIONS WERE ACTION WAS NEEDED. MY ANGELO SAYS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY LIVE OUT THE VALUES OF YOUR LIFE WITHOUT COURAGE. BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU BELIEVE IN IT WILL TAKE COURAGE TO IMPLEMENT THAT ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. YOU I'M PROUD TO STAND A DAY BECAUSE I'M PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES. WHO ACTUALLY REMEMBER CESA CHAVEZ? REMEMBER THE GREAT STRIKE AND REMEMBER THE MOVEMENT. MY ROOMMATE AT THE TIME. WAS A YOUNG LATINO FROM BUT SOME SAN BERNADINO. WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO WITH HER LIFE BUT SHE WAS PERSISTENT ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL? AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I LOOKED UP AND IRENE WAS GONE. SHE HAD GONE TO THE GRADE STRIKE. SHE'D BEEN A STUDENT FOR TWO YEARS AT UCLA. AND THOUGHT IT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR HER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO BASICALLY CHALLENGE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THAT INSPIRED ALL OF US BECAUSE WE WERE YOU KNOW COMFORTABLE SOMEWHAT COMFORTABLE POOR STUDENTS AT UCLA IN THE DORM. AND KIND OF A DISTANCE FROM THE GREAT STRIKE. AND I READ LESS. IN THE MIDDLE OF HER JUNIOR YEAR. TO GO INTO WORK IN THE GREAT IN IN THE FEELS. IT CHANGED HER LIFE. AND IT REALLY CHANGED HOURS BECAUSE WE REALIZE OF IRENE IS OUT THERE FIGHTING WE COULD NOT BE SITTING HERE IN WESTWOOD EATING GRAPES. WE HAVE TO FIGHT IN WHATEVER CAPACITY WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HER. THAT SHE WAS THERE THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED AND IT INSPIRED HER THAT SHE BECAME EVENTUALLY END UP CAME BACK TO SCHOOL. GOT A DEGREE WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AND BECAME EIGHT AN ATTORNEY WITH THE LATINO MOVEMENTS THAT WITH THEIR IT BECOMES EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT. A COMFORTABLE TIME FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE CHANGE. PEOPLE MAY TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES IN THE PERSONAL LIVES AND I'M SURE THEY WERE PROBABLY GO TO SAID THIS WON'T MATTER. THIS WON'T COUNT YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME. AND YET SHE FOUND IT IMPORTANT AS WELL AS THOUSANDS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS TO GET INVOLVED IN TO TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE THAT WAS THERE. I WANT TO CHALLENGE US TODAY AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR COMFORTABLE SITUATION THAT WE LIVE IN. THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY INDIVIDUALS WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR STREETS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS WILL EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE OFFICERS IN US. AND THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE THE QUESTION BECOMES DO WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO CHALLENGE THE SYSTEM THAT EXISTS. TO FIGHT AGAINST THE SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE BECOME VERY COMFORTABLE WITH. YET HAS RESULTED IN VERY NEGATIVE AND I THINK ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME EVERY TIME WHEN WE'RE ON THIS FLOOR WE ARE MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT OUR LIVES AND WE CELEBRATE THE PAST WE'VE CONSTANTLY CELEBRATE THE PAST. WITHOUT REALIZING THAT EVERY DAY WE ARE RIDING THE PAST. WE'RE WRITING HISTORY FOR THE DAY THAT WILL BE THE PAST FOR TOMORROW AND THE QUESTION BECOMES TO ALL OF US WHAT WILL OUR CHILDREN SAY ABOUT US WHEN WE ARE GONE. WELL THEY TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND THE COURAGE WE HAVE TO FACE THOSE CHALLENGES DESPITE WHAT WE SAW EACH AND EVERY DAY. OR WILL THEY SIMPLY SAY THAT OUR FAMILIES OUR PEOPLE WERE COMPLICIT. THAT WE WERE SILENT ON CRITICAL ISSUES AND REFUSE TO STAND UP WHEN WE COULD TO SIMPLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE I REMEMBER I READ EVERY DAY WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE GREATEST. I REMEMBER WHAT SHE DID THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WOULD RUIN HER LIFE. AND YET IT ENHANCED HER LIFE IT MADE HER THE KIND OF ATTORNEY THAT SHE BECAME AND THE COURAGEOUS WOMAN THAT STOOD UP FOR THOSE WHO COULD NOT STAND FOR THEMSELVES. AND IT CHANGED HER CAREER HER PROFESSION AND HER TRAJECTORY I THINK THAT IS SO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS REMEMBER CESA CHAVEZ THAT YES HE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS IN THE CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION. BUT HE ALSO MADE A DIFFERENCE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO TODAY CONTINUE TO CARRY FORWARD THE MESSAGE THAT HE HAS ABOUT JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO STAND UP FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T STAND FOR THEMSELVES. AND TO BE UNAFRAID AND COURAGEOUS AS WE TALK ABOUT CHANGE SO IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HONOR HIM BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO LIVE UP THE EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I BOTH THE H. R.. TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION.

TWENTY TWENTY AND HR TWENTY SEVEN RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COUNT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. BEGINNING A YEAR FROM NOW THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU WILL BEGIN THE ONCE A DECADE PROCESS OF COUNTING EVERY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS NOT HYPERBOLE TO SAY THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS WILL SHAPE CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE FOR DECADES. IT WILL AFFECT FUNDING AND POLICY DECISIONS THAT IMPACT EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE COMMUNITIES WE REPRESENT. CENSUS DATA IS USED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF SEATS EACH STATE HAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. AND IT IS TEN TO DISTRIBUTE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING. UNDER ACCOUNT COULD THREATEN AT LEAST ONE OF CALIFORNIA SEATS IN THE U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR STATE SHARE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR EDUCATION. HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER VITAL SERVICES. WITH MUCH TO LOSE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT EVERY RESIDENT IN CALIFORNIA IS COUNTED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. ACCORDINGLY OUR STATE IS MADE AN UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND WE'RE ORGANIZING EARLIER THAN EVER BEFORE. WITH BETTER COORDINATION. BUT FOR ALL OF OUR EFFORTS THE CHALLENGES TO A COMPLETE COUNTER GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH AND THERE ARE NO DO OVERS. WITH THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS AGO I AM GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HARD TO COUNT -- POPULATIONS WHOSE PARTICIPATION IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS IN SECURING A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COUNT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. BUT EACH OF US HAS A ROLE TO PLAY. WE ARE ALSO TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND WE NEED TO GET WORD OUT ABOUT THE CENSUS AND WHY PARTICIPATION IS SO IMPORTANT. THERE WILL BE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR EACH OF US TO ENGAGE IN THE COMING YEAR AND I ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO DO SO. YOU CAN START TODAY BY JOINING ME IN SUPPORTING HR TWENTY SEVEN AS WE KICK OFF THE YEAR LEADING INTO THE CENSUS. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN MS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS TO SUPPORT HR. TWENTY SEVEN AND ITS MESSAGE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DICE ENELE CENSUS. CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS IS IMPORTANT TO EVERY PERSON IN OUR STATE BUT OUR EFFORTS TO REACH A COMPLETE COUNT ARE ESPECIALLY CRITICAL FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHERE THERE IS A HISTORY OF UNTER CAM UNDER COUNTING CALIFORNIANS. BOTH CITIZENS AND UNDOCUMENTED. CALIFORNIA'S POOR PERFORMANCE IN THE NINETEEN NINETY CENSUS RESULTED IN AN UNDERCOUNT OF SOME EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND PERSONS. COSTING OUR STATE BILLIONS IN FEDERAL FUNDS OVER THE OVER THE SUCCEEDING TEN YEARS AND A VERY MALE MAY HAVE EVEN COST US A SEAT IN CONGRESS. SOME STONE EFFORTS IN ACCOUNTS. IMPROVED OUR ACCOUNTS BUT STILL RESULT IN UNDER COUNTING INCOMES CONSIDERATE. COMMISERATE SKEWS ME LOTS OF FEDERAL RESOURCES. THE TWENTY TWENTY SINCE THIS WILL BE QUICKLY UPON THIS AND I AM PROUD TO SERVE WITH CHAIRMAN BERMAN ON THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CENSUS. CREATED AFTER GOVERNOR BROWN ISSUED HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT IT COMMITTEE LAST APRIL. IT'S OUR STATE EARLIEST EFFORT TODAY. THROUGH SCHOOL BASED OUT REACH PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND EXPANDED MULTI LINGUAL MULTI MEDIA CAMPAIGN. IT IS MY GREAT HOPE THAT WE WILL COUNT EVERY PERSON IN CALIFORNIA. TO PROTECT OUR FIFTY THREE SEATS IN THE U. S. CONGRESS HAVE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION IN STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL LIKE IT'S LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS. AND RECEIVE A FAIR SHARE RESOURCES FROM FEDERAL SPENDING PROGRAMS. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN FOR RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR SENSES EFFORT THROUGH HR TWENTY SEVEN AND FOR YOUR PERSONAL COMMITMENT. TO OUR SUCCESSFUL CENSUS COUNT COLLEAGUES I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

IN CHILDREN YOUNGER IN THE AGE OF FIVE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND COMMITTEES OF COLOR HAVE LONG BEEN UNDER COUNTED IN PRIOR. A CENSUS THIS IS WHY WE A COMPLETE ACCURATE COUNT OF OUR OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION AND ACCURATE COUNT NOT ONLY DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF CONGRESSIONAL SEATS BUT HOW MUCH MONEY CALIFORNIA RECEIVES. FOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS -- PROGRAMS THAT MONITOR DISCRIMINATION IMPLEMENT CIVIL RIGHTS AND REMEMBER FEWER FEDERAL DOLLARS.

EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- BUT CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA IS THEIR HOME -- THESE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED OUR THEIR HOME AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT -- THAT THE IN THE CENSUS THAT -- THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE COUNTED -- AND THAT THE RESOURCES ARE BROUGHT TO THOSE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES ARE BROUGHT TO THOSE AREAS AS WELL.
