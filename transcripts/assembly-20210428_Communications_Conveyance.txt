C. A. U. N. C. V. H. D. A. TO ENSURE THAT THE- THAT THIS IS IN. IN A WAY THAT IS WORK. FOR A- IN OUR WORKERS. WELL WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND THE BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE I WANT TO STATE ON THE RECORD AS I'VE SAID TOO MANY OF YOU THAT I'LL BE AMENDING THE BILL AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY WHICH MAY BE ON THE FLOOR DEPENDING WHAT HAPPENS IT APPROPRIATIONS. TO CAPTAIN NINE EIGHT EIGHT FEE AT EIGHTY CENTS PER LINE PER MONTH TO PUT IT IN PARITY WITH NINE ONE ONE. THE FEE WILL FUNCTION VERY SIMILARLY TO NINE ONE ONE FOR THE NOT THE EIGHTY CENTS WILL SERVE AS A CAP BUT THE ACTUAL COST OF THE FEE WILL BE SET. BY- YES DOING AN ACTUAL COST ANALYSIS AND THEN BRINGING THAT NUMBER TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO APPROVE THE ACTUAL FEET. ONCE YES HAS THAT COST ESTIMATE BUT IT WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO GO ABOVE EIGHTY CENTS. THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SHOULD NOT BECOME THE BACKSTOP FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE. BUT WE SHOULD BE ENSURING THAT THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO RUN SMOOTHLY AND THAT PEOPLE CAN AND DO YOU HAVE ACCESS. TO THE CARE THEY NEED. LAST YEAR BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED. BECAUSE THERE COULD THAT INCREDIBLE THINGS. THEY CONGRESS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED THE UNDERLYING LEGISLATION. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE NATIONAL SUICIDE HOTLINE DESIGNATION ACT. ESTABLISHING NINE EIGHTY EIGHT AS THE NEW THREE DIGIT ALTERNATIVE TO NINE ONE ONE. FOR SUICIDE AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. STATES SUCH AS WE ARE ARE NOW WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE NINETY EIGHT SYSTEM. AND BY JULY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO NINE EIGHT EIGHT WILL GO LIVE. AB NINE EIGHT EIGHT ALSO KNOWN AS THE MILES CALL LIFELINE IN SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT IMPLEMENTED THIS NEW NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WITH AROUND THE CLOCK MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CARE INCLUDING. CRISIS COUNSELORS WHO CAN PROVIDE LIFESAVING CARE OVER THE PHONE IN 95% OF CASES. AND MOBILE CRISIS TEAM STAFFED BY TRAINED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN RESPOND TO THE COMMUNITY IN THE COMMUNITY TO CALLERS WHO NEED TO BE CONNECTED. FROM NINE EIGHT EIGHT TWO IMMEDIATE CRISIS SERVICES. WE HAVE SKYROCKETING RATES OF SUICIDE AND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE BEING KILLED BY POLICE EVERY DAY. SUICIDE RATES OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE GONE UP 35% AND THE NUMBER IS ONLY CONTINUING TO RISE DURING THE PANDEMIC. RECENT REPORTS IN THE OUR TIME SURE THAN AN AVERAGE OF THREE PEOPLE A DAY ARE BEING SHOT AND KILLED BY POLICE. AND A QUARTER OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS ARE PEOPLE WITH KNOWN MENTAL ILLNESS. NINETY EIGHT EIGHT IS UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE LIFESAVING EMERGENCY PHONE SERVICE. EVERY PERSON THAT I HAVE TALKED TO ABOUT THIS BILL HAS HAD A STORY THEY WANT SHOULD SHARE WITH ME ABOUT HOW THEY WISH THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NINE EIGHT EIGHT. IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS FOR THEM. PARENTS WHOSE SONS WERE IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND NEEDED AN APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. FRIENDS WHO NEEDED A COUNSELOR TO BE CONNECTED WITH URGENTLY. MY OWN CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE SEEN THE LIVES OF THEIR SENSE TAKEN AT THE HANDS OF POLICE WELL IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. UNDER AB NINETY EIGHT EVERY CALIFORNIAN WILL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A RESOURCE TO CALL WHEN THEY OR A LOVED ONE OR FACING SUICIDAL OR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. IT WILL BE AS SIMPLE AS PICKING UP THE PHONE AND DIALING NINE EIGHT EIGHT. AND THIS IS A KEY POINT WE CAN FIND THIS LIFESAVING INTERVENTION FOR LITERALLY PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. THE NINE EIGHTY P. IS DESIGNED TO BUILD ON THE EXISTING NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE CALL CENTERS. BUILDING OFFICE EXISTING SYSTEM COUPLED WITH THE NEW FEDERAL DOLLARS. INCLUDING AN 85% REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS. WILL KEEP THIS BE LOW FOR PHONE CUSTOMERS. WELL THE IMPACT ON YOUR PHONE BILL MIGHT BE NEGLIGIBLE. THE IMPACT AND CALIFORNIANS NEEDING MENTAL HEALTH WILL BE PROFOUND. EVEN STILL I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE FEE IS IT NEVER PLACES AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THOSE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AB NINETY EIGHT STATE THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WILL BE EXEMPT FROM PAYING THE FEE. THE BILL EXCLUDES PREPAID LINES WHICH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY USED BY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THIS SIMPLE CHANGE CALLING NINE EIGHT EIGHT INSTEAD OF NINE ONE ONE WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON OUR CONSTITUENTS LIVE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS VITAL AND TIMELY PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

THANK YOU KNOW OTHER LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. ARE GOING TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOING TO CAN QUESTIONS FROM CAYMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS APOLOGIZE ON THAT'S GOT STUCK. YES I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING% THIS FORWARD I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY ON THE FLOOR OR IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHO HAVEN'T BEEN TOUCHED BY MENTAL ILLNESS IN THEIR LIVES. AND HAVING A HOT LINE LIKE NINE EIGHT WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AT THE SAME TIME I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SURCHARGE AND WHAT THING HOW WE ARE CONSISTENT AND WHAT SURCHARGES COVER- SO CAN THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES- WHAT- COVER BY THE SURCHARGE AND WHAT'S COVERED BY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH- AND OTHER PROVISIONS- BECAUSE IN MY MIND IT'S ALMOST LIKE. TWO BILLS AND ONE WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED YOU KNOW I THINK YOU ACKERMAN SAID IN YOUR OPENING. THAT WITHOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE CRISIS CARE UNITS. IT YOU KNOW JUST A HOT LINE ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO GET THE CARE OUR COMMUNITIES NEED- BUT I REALLY STRONGLY FEEL TAT A SURCHARGE SHOULD BE USED FOR THE PREVENTION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON THE GROUND. FOR THE AUTHOR TO SPEAK TO THAT YES THANK YOU MISTER NUMBER BACK. AND SO LET ME SERVICES SO. THAT THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION WITH PROVISION IN THERE BECAUSE I THINK IT ACTUALLY RELATES TO SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID BY THE CABLE INDUSTRY- IT ALLOWS FOR US TO. AND SHE WAS CORRECTED ALLOWS IT DOESN'T MANDATE US TO CHARGE A FEE OBVIOUSLY- FOR THE PROVISION OF OBVIOUSLY THE OVERALL- TELEPHONE SERVICES IN THE HOT LINES AS YOU UNDERSTAND. BUT ALSO FOR PERSONNEL IN THE PROVISION OF ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH. CRISIS OUT REGION STABILIZATION SERVICES. BY DIRECTING- THE NINETY EIGHT NATIONAL SUICIDE VENTUREON TO JUST THREE THINGS WHICH ARE. THE CRISIS RESPONSE TEAMS STABILIZATION SERVICES. AND THE PERSONALITY ANSWER THE PHONE SO IT'S NOT AND OTHER THINGS SHE SAID. AND WE ARE WORKING TO CLARIFY THAT IT IS JUST THE THINGS IN THE AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION AND AGAIN JUST THE SERVICES YOU GOT WHEN YOU PICK UP THAT PHONE. AND YOU CALL NINE EIGHT EIGHT RIGHT NOW MANY PEOPLE IN MENTAL CRISIS. CALLING ON AND THEY NEED SOMEONE TO SHOW UP. I SO POLICE SHOT. AND WE WANT HERE IS FROM HEALTH PROFESSIONALSTO SHOW UP AND RIGHT NOW MANY COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY AND SO WE HAVE TO SET THAT UP WITH IT INTO A WELL AS I MENTIONED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL COVER MATCHING 85% SO THAT IS DOES TAKE THAT COSTS DOWN BUT IT DOES JUST PROVIDE THE SERVICES ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NINETY EIGHT EIGHT. BUT I WILL ALSO LET TARA GIMBEL EASTMAN COMMENT OKAY SHE HAS ANYTHING TO ADD. FROM THE START AGAINST YOU. YEAH I KNOW I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND ADDS THAT AND YOU BOTH HEARD FROM MATTHEW AND- THE CABLE. EDUCATION AND- AND COMPLETE EACH DAY. WERE IN ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS TO DRAW THOSE REALLY FINE LINE. ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE COVERED AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE SHARED AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THOSE BRIGHT LINE CAN BE DRAWN VERY CLEARLY SO. THAT SHOULD BE COMING SHORTLY. I WILL ALSO JUST NOW BECAUSE THE COMPARISON HAS COME UP TO NINE ONE ONE. THERE IS NO REALLY CLEAR FEDERAL GUIDANCE IN HOW NINE ONE ONE SHE REVENUE. AND CALIFORNIA NATIVE BERRY AT THE FIFTH EXPOSITION. TO LIMIT THE NINE ONE ONE G. REVENUE TO BEING USED FOR TECHNOLOGY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND CALIFORNIA IN MANY WAYS HAS. BEEN REALLY PROACTIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT YOU REVENUE. GOES TO THERAPY NINE ONE ONE. BUT EVEN HERE WE'VE MADE EXCEPTIONS REVIEWS NINE ONE ONE THREE REVENUE FOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION WHICH MEANS ENTIRELY% APPROPRIATE. AND HERE BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A SPECIFIC VISION FOR HOW. THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM WOULD BE SET UP. CONGRESS DIDN'T LEAVE IT OPEN AND IT LIKE THEY DID WITH NINE ONE ONE. THEY WERE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT IT COVERING THE SCORE THING. THE ROUTING CALL PERSONAL MOBILECRISIS AND CRISIS. CRISIS STABILIZATION SERVICES. AND SO. WHILE THERE ARE CERTAINLY SIMILARITIES TO NINE ONE ONE THEY- ARE INCREDIBLY DISTINCT AND I THINK. WHAT WE REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS ON ATHLETES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT IS THAT. BOTTOM LINE THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE. THAT WHEN YOU PICK UP THE PHONE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES SHE WOULD NEVER CALL NINE ONE ONE WITH A HEART ATTACK AND BE TOLD THAT THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO HELP OUR CALL WITH THE FIRE IN YOUR HOUSE AND TOLD NO ONE IS THERE TO HELP. YOU THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER. THAT IF HE IS REALLY SERVING A CRITICAL PIECE. OF THE PUZZLE IN MAKING. SURE THAT THE SIMPSONS TOGETHER. SO WITH I DO. THAT THAT IS THE PER. OF THE SPA OF THE- I WOULD SAY IS LET. THE A- THAT NINE ONE WAS NEARLY. AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT WHO BEARS THE COST FOR PROVISION OF SERVICES. AND WE SHOULD THAT BE YOUR MOBILE PROVIDERS- MOBILE REPAIRS. OR SHOULD THAT BE THE GOVERNMENT AND SO I THINK THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO AND I WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE SPONSORS TO HELP THREAD THAT NEEDLE- BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT IF WE DON'T SOLVE THIS AND WE STILL COMBINED. PROVISION OF ON THE GROUND SERVICES WITH THE SURCHARGE THIS IS SOMETHING I COULDN'T SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR. BUT I KNOW YOU'RE IN THESE ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS AND I APPRECIATE THAT SO I'LL GIVE A COURTESY I TODAY. AND LOOK FOR TO THOSE CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS THE OTHER POINT I REALLY LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHORED ABOUT THE CAP. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT CAP IS REALLY IMPORTANT- AND SO THAT'S WHY THEY IT REALLY DELINEATING OUT WHAT THE SURCHARGE WILL COVER. WILL SET THAT WILL TELL US ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. THIRTY FORTY FIFTY CENTS. PER MONTH ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN CENTS A MONTH AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE DISCUSSION AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU AS FOR HER. AFTER THANK YOU MISTER ROGERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SOMEONE FRAUD DURING THIS. PRISON LEGISLATURE ON PROBABLY A COLD. QUARTERS WELL. AS SOMEONE MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE OF THE FOR SPOTTER OF SEEING THE NEED FOR DEDICATED SYSTEMS. TO PROCESS AND SERVE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES. I BELIEVE IT'S CRUCIAL THIS TIME NOW THE CALIFORNIA HAS A PROPER PROTOCOLS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE- BEST SERVE THOSE IN CRISIS. WITHOUT THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW BILL THINKS CRITICALLY ABOUT HAVING THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT AND NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER. TO HELP TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. BUT WITHOUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION THE HOPEFULLY THE STEINBERG IT'S TO CAN. HELP ANSWER- I SAW THE ANSWER ON THE NOW WITH THAT.

I AM AWARE THAT OTHER BILLS HAVE SOME OF THE SAME COMPONENTS NOT APPLAUD THOSE EFFORTS. I AM HAPPY TO KEEP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN ADVOCATES THAT SHARE MY GOALS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE THREE COMPONENTS MUST BE PART OF THIS BILL. BUT AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA BROADBAND COUNCIL WHO WORK HARD TO MAKE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BROADBAND FOR ALL. UP ACTIONABLE THESE THREE. COMPONENTS ARE CENTRAL TO THIS BILL ONCE AGAIN CONNECTIVITY'S DEVICE DIGITAL LITERACY. WE CAN'T HAVE A BILL WITHOUT THESE THREE COMPONENTS WE CAN WE CAN NOT HAVE THE CALIFORNIA.

IT CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M I'M HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU WE BEGIN BY COMMENDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON FOR THE COURAGE AND THE VISION TO BRING FORWARD AB. FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE. YOU HEARD ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON TALK ABOUT 40% OF THE RESIDENTS IN PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING NOT BEING CONNECTED. THAT IS FROM SURVEYS THAT WERE DONE ABOUT A YEAR AGO. THE FOR THE PANDEMIC SHELTER IN PLACE. AT THAT POINT WE HAD A SITUATION IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF RESIDENTS IN PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING COULD NOT BE CONNECTED CONTINUOUSLY THEIR CHILDREN COULDN'T CONNECT FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AND THEY COULDN'T ACCESS THEIR DOCTORS FOR VISITS. YOU HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE AS I HOLD HERE A LIST OF MORE THAN FIFTY SIX HUNDRED PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING COMPLEXES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE MORE THAN ANYONE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR SENSITIVITY TO THESE RESIDENTS AND- APPRECIATE WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS DONE OVER THE YEARS TO SUPPORT THEM. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING COMPLEXES. OR ON A FIXED BUDGET THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY WITHOUT OUR HELP. TO GET THE CONNECTIVITY THE DIGITAL LITERACY TRAINING OR THE DEVICES FOR THEIR RESIDENTS. THERE RESIDENTS ARE ALSO THE MOST IMPOVERISHED CALIFORNIANS IN OUR STATE BY DEFINITION. THIS IS THE TIME IN WHICH WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY. WITH THE PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING COMPLEXES THESE ARE THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES ON BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO NONPROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP TO GET EVERYONE CONNECTED. AS WE'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND DIGITAL ACCESS IS THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CIVIL RIGHTS AND ACCESS DELAYED IS ACCESS DENIED IT IS TIME THAT WE GET ALL CALIFORNIANS AND ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION ONLINE THANK YOU. MISTER MARKS.

WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND OUR HOUSING FACILITY IS NOT A LUXURY IT'S A NECESSITY. WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED MANY OF OUR FAMILIES IN OUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR UNIT COMPLEX IN HUNTINGTON PARK. AND IT EIGHTY FOUR UNITS IN CHINO. WERE AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF ACCESS TO INTERNET SERVICE. ACCESS TO COMPUTERS. AND ACCESS TO BASIC DIGITAL LITERACY TRAINING. BASED ON RECENT SURVEYS 89% OF OUR RESIDENTS WERE NOT CONNECTED. 89% MANY OF OUR KIDS COULD NOT ACCESS THEIR CLASSROOM ONLINE AND THEIR PARENTS COULD NOT AFFORD ACCESS TO BROADBAND. THIS BILL AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE WHEN SURE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TO ALL RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND PROVIDE DIGITAL LITERACY TRAINING FOR RESIDENTS. AND ASSIST THEM IN GETTING APPROPRIATE COMPUTING DEVICES. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HINDER OUR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL EVEN THOSE RESIDING IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. OUR RESIDENTS IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING ARE BY DEFINITION THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS AND MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR DISTRICT DISDAINFULLY TELEHEALTH REMOTE WORK JOB TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS PLEASE I URGE YOU TO HELP OUR RESIDENTS BY SUPPORTING AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

IN FACT- FIX THAT- WORDING AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. OCTOBER NINETEEN AS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR BROADBAND ACCESS AND THE GAPS THAT STILL EXIST ACROSS THE STATE. IN SERVICE AND ACCESS. OR FUNDING IS CRITICAL TO FILL THAT GAP. SO IS THE NEED TO ENSURE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND PERMITS. AB FIVE THREE SEVEN MODIFIES THE STATE BROAD BANDING PERMITTING PROCESS. TO ENSURE LINES WITH UPDATED FEDERAL RULES. AND MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAKE DECISIONS WITHIN FEDERALLY MANDATED TIMELINES. THAT ARE TYPICALLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PROJECT. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED LEGISLATION THAT ESTABLISHED A SHOT CLOCK REMEDY. FOR PERMITS THAT WERE NEVER ACTED UPON BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN FEDERAL TIMELINES. WELL THIS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN PRIORITIZING THE PROCESS SEEM TO BROADBAND PERMITS. WE'VE SEEN INSTANCES WHERE DISAGREEMENTS OCCUR. AROUND WHEN THE SHOT CLOCK STARTS- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE STOCK SHOT CLOCK ENDS. AB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE CLARITY AROUND THE STARTING POINT FOR THE SHOT CLOCK. AS WELL AS CLARITY FOR THE EXISTING DEEMED APPROVED PROCESS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SHOT CLOCK. THESE CLEAR. WILL MAKE SURE THE INTENT OF MY ORIGINAL BILL IS REALIZED AND REDUCED AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW. THIS BILL WILL MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS SUGGEST DESPERATELY NEED IMPROVED INTERNET ACCESS FOR SCHOOL TSHOLOTSHO TELEHEALTH REMOTE WORK COMMERCEIT WILL MAKE SURE THAT HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS ARE DELIVERED.

ALL AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE THAT WILL ALLOW HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS TO BE COMPLETED IN MONTHS INSTEAD OF YEARS. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS PERMITS SHOT CLOCKS IN PLACE FOR BROADBAND PROJECTS THANKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORKS EIGHTY FIFTY SEVEN FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN. THIS BILL UPDATES CALIFORNIA LAW TO REFLECT THE NEW FEDERAL TIMELINE THAT WERE RECENTLY ADOPTED SO THE SHOT CLOCKS ARE CONSISTENT IT ALSO PROVIDES CLARITY AROUND WHEN THE SHOT CLOCK STARTS IN THE PROCESS AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE SHOT CLOCK. EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE IT PRESERVES LOCAL CONTROL BY ALLOWING CITY USE WHATEVER PRODUCT THAT THEY WANT TO EVALUATE BROADBAND PROGRESS M. AND IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO APPROVE OR DENY THE PROFIT FROM IT. ALL THE BILL DOES IS MAKE SURE THE CITIES MAKE A DECISION WITHIN FEDERALLY MANDATED TIMELINES WHICH ARE TYPICALLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PROJECT. THIS BILL WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE IN NEED OF IMPROVED INTERNET ACCESS FOR SCHOOL TELEHEALTH REMOTE WORK AND COMMERCE IT'LL MAKE SURE THAT HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS ARE DELIVERED IN MONTHS INSTEAD OF YEARS. EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN WILL CONTINUE IN THE SUCCESS OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK'S EIGHTY THIRTY SEVEN WHILE UPDATING THE LAW TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IT WILL LEAD TO COMMUNITIES GETTING QUICKER ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS WHILE MAINTAINING LOCAL.

THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PEDRO NAVA AND I'M CURRENTLY THE CHAIR OF LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION BUT I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE THREE SEVEN THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS THE STATE GOVERNMENT. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE COMMISSION ISSUED A REPORT URGING CALIFORNIA TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND ACCESS TO DIGITAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES TECHNOLOGY HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY IN WHICH CALIFORNIA'S X. ACCESS AND RECEIVE INFORMATION AND THE STATE MUST INNOVATE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH CONVENIENT DIGITAL SERVICES THEY HAVE COME TO EXPECT IN OUR REPORT ENTITLED A CUSTOMER CENTRIC UPGRADE FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT WE FOUND THAT HIGH SPEED BROADBAND HAS BECOME AN INTERNAL CHANNEL FOR CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS CRITICAL SERVICES BOTH FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IT EXPANDS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION AND ENABLE SMALL BUSINESSES TO EXPAND THEIR MARKET REACH. IT GENERATES GREATER CIVIC PARTICIPATION BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR CALIFORNIANS TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR GOVERNMENT AND IT CAN STREAMLINED STATE PROCESS THESE BY OFFERING THEM ONLINE. OR THROUGH APPS ACCESSIBLE ANYWHERE YET IN ITS TWENTY TWENTY ISSUE BRIEF ON CALIFORNIA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT AS MANY AS TWO POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO BROADBAND. HIGH SPEED BROADBAND ACCESS IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER. IT FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT WITHOUT-INTERNET ACCESS OR LACK SUFFICIENT BANDWIDTH TO MEET THEIR HOUSEHOLD NEEDS. AS THE STATE WRAPS UP ITS DIGITAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO IT WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACESS TO AFFORDABLE RELIABLE BROADBAND COVERAGE. IN THIS REPORT THE COMMISSION URGED STATE LEADERS TO MAXIMIZE OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS TO CONVENIENTLY ACCESS DIGITAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. AB FIVE THREE SEVEN WITHVANCE THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION BY INCREASING ACCESS TO RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. THE BILL WOULD MAKE SURE THAT ALL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS UTILIZE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BROADBAND PERMIT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

WE AGREED THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED SPEED INTERNET FOR EDUCATION BUSINESS COMMUNICATION AND TELEHEALTH HOWEVER AB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN DOES NOT PROVIDE SAFE AFFORDABLE SECURE HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND IT WILL NOT IMPACT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

MANY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS REMAIN DISPROPORTIONATELY DISCONNECTED FROM BROADBAND ASKING FOR MORE RECENT SURVEY THAT FOUND OVER A QUARTER OF A LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA. AND CONNECTED UNDER CONNECTED MEANING THEY DEPEND ON THEIR SMARTPHONE FOR INTERNET EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OFTEN HAD TO MAKE TRADE OFFS. THIS PAST YEAR MANY WORKERS LOST THEIR JOBS FORCING THEM TO FORGO SERVICES TO SAVE MONEY INCLUDING DISCONNECTING THEIR INTERNET SERVICE. OKAY NEED FOR BARE BONES SERVICE PLANS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT STREAMING CAPACITY CALIFORNIANS IN RURAL AREAS PARTICULARLY HIT HARD AND INTERNET ACCESS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY. AT A TIME WHEN THE PAIN THEN I CAN MOVE SCHOOLS JOBS AND EVEN HEALTH CARE ONLINE THIS BILL IS ESPECIALLY TIMELY THIS BILL IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD EXPANDING BROADBAND ACCESS AND PROVIDING I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO. CONNECT CALIFORNIANS TO NECESSARY HEALTHCARE AS WELL AS OTHER VITAL SERVICES WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO STREAMLINE THE LITTLE INCOME QUALIFICATION LANGUAGE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATION BETWEEN AND ABOUT.

DEGREE LENDING INSTITUTE IS A POLICY RESEARCH ORGANIZING AND LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE WORKING FOR RACIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUITY NEARLY 22% OF CALIFORNIANS AREN'T CONNECTED OR UNCONNECTED TO THE INTERNET USUALLY BECAUSE THEN ACCESSIBLE COST TOO MUCH FOR TOO MANY FAMILIES. THIS AFFORDABILITY BARRIER AFFECT LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUTERS. THE MOST. WHEN REMINDING IN YOUNG STUDENTS OF COLOR OUR REPORT ON THE HARM TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WE HEARD STORIES ABOUT STUDENTS EXPERIENCES OF THE CLASS THING HARD BY THEIR INABILITY TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE AND ADEQUATE BROADBAND. A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD FAMILYWENT INTO THAT YOU TO BROADBAND COSTS AND HAVE THEIR INTERNET CONNECTED TWICE FOR NON PAYMENT. HER FAMILY BORROWED MONEY FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO PAY THE BILL BECAUSE OF HOW SENSUAL BROADBAND SERVICE WAS FOR EDUCATION AND HER SIBLINGS EDUCATION. NO FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO GO INTO THAT TO TRY TO ACCESS SERVICES LIKE BROADBAND CONNECTION BUT THE CAPABILITY. TO SUCCEED AT SCHOOL AND WORK. YOUR AB ELEVENTH SIX BUT HOW CANNOT FUNCTION CLOSE. CENTRAL TO. BY PROVIDING FOR TO BONTA INTERACTION. WILL ENABLE ENTIRE FACT THAT THEIR NET AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND PROVIDE A WAY TO CLOSE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP.

THAT GAP ONLY GROWS WITH STUDENTS GET OLDER IN ADDITION HAVING SAID TIMES SCHOOL FROM HOME FOR THE COMPANY IN PENTOMIC HAS ONLY AMPLIFIED THE HARM OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO STUDENT SUCCESS.

TAX FORTY REASONS THE GREEN LINE INSTITUTE AFTER YOU JOIN US IN SUPPORTING AB. ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX. OPPOSITION TESTIMONY WE'RE CALLING- MISTER WEATHERBEE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHECKING HERE ME YES THANK YOU. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR IN MEMBERS DUSTIN WHETHER BE WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES AB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX BECAUSE THE BILL WOULD IMPOSE AN ADDITIONAL TAX UP TO TWENTY THREE CENTS A MONTH TO FIND A NEW CALIFORNIA CONNECT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE PC. TO PROVIDE EVERY ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME AND STUDENT HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE A SUBSIDY TO PAY FOR ANY CHARGE RELATED TO AFFORDABLE BROADBAND SERVICE AND DEVICES MAKE NO MISTAKE AB ELEVEN THIRTY SIX IS A SIGNIFICANT TAX INCREASE. CALIFORNIANS ALREADY PAY SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON THE PHONE SERVICE AND EIGHTY ELEVEN TWENTY SIX MAKES PHONE SERVICE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE BY ADDING A SEVEN TAX TO TAXPAYERS PHONE BILL BUT YOU BY CHOOSING TO USE THE PHONE BILLS ACTIVELY TAX COLLECTION SERVICE FOR NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES CALIFORNIA IS CHOOSING TO MAKE THE COST OF THE PHONE LESS AFFORDABLE. ON AVERAGE A TYPICAL WIRELESS CUSTOMER IN THE STATE PAY MORE THAN 23% OF THE TOTAL PHONE BILL AND FEES TAXES AND SURCHARGES THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TWENTY TWENTY. WE ALSO QUESTION WHETHER ADDITIONAL REVENUE IS NECESSARY AT THIS TIME THE OTHER CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE FUNDS FOR THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT WHICH INCLUDES FUND THEIR EARMARKED FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND SUBSIDY PROGRAMS WE ARE CONCERNED I TAX INCREASE RESULT IN TAXPAYERS PAY FOR SIMILAR PROGRAMS BY. THE EMERGENCY BROADBAND BENEFIT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE FCC STARTING THIS MONTH PROVIDED SUBSIDY OF FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH TO ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO PAY FOR BROADBAND SERVICE. IN ADDITION WITH THE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A RECORD TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR RESERVES WHICH IS WHY THE GOVERNOR AND ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE STATED THAT ADDITIONAL TAXES ARE UNNECESSARY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. GIVING THESE REASONS CALTEX LET'S RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB. ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. WE HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS- TWO MINUTES OPPOSITION PLEASE. YES THE SERGEANTS WILL DIRECT YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MY NAME IS PAUL MCGANN FROM WHY AMERICA AND I WANT TO HAVE TWO MINUTES A TRUCE HERE TO TELL YOU WHY WE NEED TO PLAY THIS JUST CAME A LITTLE MORE DIFFERENTLY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND AND YOU'RE SAYING THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IS A BIG DEAL I'M GONNA POINTS TO A MUCH BIGGER NUMBER THAT SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT IS THE MONEY THAT WAS ACTUALLY ILLEGALLY TRANSFERRED FROM YOUR STATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC UTILITIES TO THEIR WIRELESS SUBSIDIARIES IN ORDER TO BUILD THE FOUR G. NETWORK IF YOU WANT SOME REAL MONEY TO REALLY CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT'S WHERE IT IS. IT'S ON THE BOTTOM LINES OF THESE COMPANIES THAT HAVE ENGINEERED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE VERY CRAFTILY OVER THE YEARS TO COME MAKE SURE WE WERE IN THIS DESPERATE POSITION SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT MORE WIRELESS IN PLACE YOU UNDERSTAND THE TITLE TO IS WHAT YOU NEED HERE IT'S YOU PUBLIC UTILITY THAT MUST PROVIDE SERVICES THAT JUST AND REASONABLE RATES. THEY ARE THE SOLUTION HERE THEY NEED TO PUT FIBER OPTIC DIRECTLY TO EVERY HOME AND BUSINESS AND CHARGE A JUST AND REASONABLE RATES AND WHY IS THAT BECAUSE WE PAID FIVE TO SEVEN DOLLARS PER MONTH PER PHONE BILLS SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES NOR TO GET IT DONE. AND THAT WAS MISAPPROPRIATED AGAINST THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT SECTION TWO FIVE FOUR K. THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN IT SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY FROM UTILITY AND PUT TO A PRIVATE COMPANY YET IT DID FORTUNATELY THE A REGULATORS SUIT AGAINST THIS IN FEDERAL COURT AND YOU CAN NOW CORRECT ALL OF THIS MISS MARTIAN SHENANIGANS. GOING ON FOR TWENTY YEARS AND YOU CAN GET SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS BACK TO REALLY CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO THAT A LITTLE BIT BROADER IN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN THE TALKING POINTS GIVEN TO YOU BY THE LAWYERS AND LOBBYISTS BY CROWN CASTLE WHO IS NOT A C. LET GO AND I LOOKED AND HAS NO ROLE IN THIS MATTER. AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR STATE PUBLIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS UTILITIES LOOK NO FURTHER. THAN AT&amp;T CALIFORNIA AND- PRESERVED MONEY BY TO THE- THEY CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM. AND WE LOOK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT- WE ARE THE FIRST TO THE SECOND- I BELIEVE.
