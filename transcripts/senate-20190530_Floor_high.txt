FROM USING CAMPAIGN OR LEGAL DEFENSE FUNDS TO PAY OR REIMBURSE FOR A PENALTY JUDGMENT OR SETTLEMENT RELATED TO SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL ABUSE OR SEXUAL pHARASSMENT CLAIMS. THIS BILL WAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO ALLOW CANDIDATES. AND ELECTED OFFICERS TO USE CAMPAIGN LEGAL DEFENSE FUNDS UNTIL THEY ARE FOUND LIABLE ONCE FOUND LIABLE FOR SUCH VIOLATIONS THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND CANDIDATES. TO REIMBURSE ALL FUNDS USED TO PAY FOR LEGAL EXPENSES AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLAIM. COLLEAGUES POLITICAL DONATIONS ARE MADE TO SUPPORT CANDIDATES EFFORTS TO REPRESENT THEIR COMMUNITIES NOT TO BE USED AS A SLUSH FUND TO FINANCE BAD BEHAVIOR.

COPY AT ALL. BY [inaudible] PAN. FIVE THIRTY FIVE NO. ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES. MOVING ON NOW TO FILE ITEM. EIGHT SENATOR DORADO SHOW ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE UP FILE ITEM. EIGHT MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY NUMBER SENATOR DRAWS -- AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC RECORDS SENATOR DORADO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- AND MEMBERS. SB SEVEN FOUR NINE IS A VERY NARROW APPROACH TO INCREASING ACCESS TO INFORMATION. ABOUT PUBLIC GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. AS WELL AS PRIVATE COMPANIES COMPLIANCE WITH BY AMERICA LAWS. MY BILL WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT INFORMATION IN A PUBLIC CONTRACT BETWEEN A PRIVATE INDUSTRY EMPLOYER. AND THE STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY. WITH REGARDS TO JOB CREATION JOB QUALITY JOB RETENTION. AS WELL AS BY AMERICA LAWS COMPLIANCE IS NOT EXEMPTED FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AS A TRADE SECRET OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON. SEVEN FOUR NINE POSITIONS CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE USED IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY. AS A GLOBAL ECONOMIC LEADER CALIFORNIA'S STRIVES TO GOVERN AND PURCHASE FOR THE COMMON GOOD. YEAH WITHOUT ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT JOB CREATION HOW CAN WE BE POSITIVE THAT ARE PURCHASING POWER REWARDS GOOD RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS. ARE EARNING PROFITS WITH OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS. FOR EXAMPLE. ELECTRIC BUSES. IT'S SECURED MILLIONS IN CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAXCREDITS. IN EXCHANGE FOR PROMISING TO CREATE OVER SIX HUNDRED JOBS. WHEN A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST WAS FILED? BEGIN MILESTONE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO ASSESS PROGRESS IN DELIVERING UPON THESE COMMITMENTS. THE REQUESTED WAS DENIED THIS INFORMATION UNDER THE CLAIM THAT THE INFORMATION IS PROPRIETARY. INCREASINGLY RECORDS RELATED TO WAGES BENEFITS JOB QUALITY RETENTION TRAINING PROGRAMS. ARE REDACTED FROM PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AT THE REQUEST APPROACH PRIVATE CONTRACTORS AND SUBSIDY RECIPIENTS. BASED ON A TRADE SECRET EXEMPTION. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG COMMITTED TO RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTING POLICIES BUT TO ACHIEVE FULLY THE GOALS OF RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTING ACCESS TO KEY INFORMATION IS VITAL. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A FAIR RETURN ON OUR TAXES AND THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF WE ARE GETTING WHAT WE BARGAINED. FOR IS GETTING THE INFORMATION RELATED TO JOBS. IN THIS SB SEVEN FORTY NINE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE CREATING JOBS AND PROTECTING JOB QUALITY -- THERE IS CHATTER THE DISS. HE COULD LEAD TO MORE LAWSUITS AT SAID RED SETTER. FRANKLY THIS IS A WAY TO CLARIFY TO AVOID LAWSUITS SO REALLY HOLD UP COLLEAGUES THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ROGER WAS HER ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR HUESO. FOLLOWED BY A SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW WE WE ARE TAKING A GOOD LOOK AT THIS BILL AND AND OF COURSE I ALWAYS HAVE CONCERNS THAT -- THAT -- IN ANY BILL COULD LEAD. TO YOU'RE THE LEAD TO ANY AT JUST THREE ANOTHER REASON FOR SOMEBODY. TO CHALLENGE OR SU OUR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OF COURSE. IN THE INSTANCE OF SAN DIEGO WHILE THE OTHER CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS. OR OR OR SOME OF THE CITIES IN MY AND IN MY IN MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR SAN DIEGO -- THEY'RE JUST SEVEN INDIVIDUALS THAT MAKE A LIVING OUT OF OF THESE LAWSUITS AND AND THAT HAS CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER BECAUSE OF COURSE ARE WE WANT OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO BE SPENT OUR COMMUNITIES BUILDING PARKS LIBRARIES FILLING POTHOLES. BUT YOU KNOW AS I LOOK AT THIS BILL I ALSO RECALL THAT I I SERVED -- IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HELPING TO CREATE QUALITY JOBS FOR THE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. AND RECALL THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL PROMISES THAT ARE MADE TO CREATE QUALITY JOBS YOU CAN DO IN JUNCTION WITH. CONTRACTS THAT WE ENTER INTO WITH BUSINESSES AND OF JUST IN GENERAL ANYONE PURSUING. ANY LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR OR MAKING A CLAIM THAT US OUR PARTICULAR INVESTMENT IS GOING TO CREATE -- JOBS AND IT'S GOING TO CREATE QUALITY JOBS AND IT'S GOING TO CREATE JOBS IN THE SECTORS THAT PEOPLE DESIRE. OFTENTIMES ARE FEDERAL GET CREDIT STATE GRANTS THAT REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REPORT THIS SO WHEN I LOOK AT THIS BILL I I SAW A VERY REASONABLE BILL. THE BILL THAT ENDEAVORS TO SIMPLY -- PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC SO THAT THAT ASPECT OF THE JOB CREATION ELEMENT OF OF ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACTIONS CAN BE VERIFIED -- WORKING IN IN -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS AS AN EMPLOYEE AND ALSO AS A COUNCIL MEMBER YOU WANT THIS INFORMATION I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS WOULD BE -- OF OF CONCERN TO ANYBODY -- I THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE WILL WE'VE SEEN THAT IF. IF THE AGENCY HAS THIS INFORMATION IF REQUESTED. IN ASSOCIATION WITH A CONTRACT THAT. A AND IT'S IN THEIR POSITION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC IT ONLY WILL WILL DEMONSTRATE WHAT JOBS ARE BEING CREATED WHO'S GETTING PAID AT WHAT FOR WHAT SERVICES AND I THINK THAT IS VERY FAIR THIS IS A FOR BILL I THINK. THIS IS A BILL WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT. THANK YOU CENTER HUESO SENATORS BONE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION SB. SEVEN FORTY NINE IF THIS BILL PASSES PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO CONTRACT WITH STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY MUST DISCLOSE RECORDS OF WAGES BENEFITS AND WORKING HOURS OF ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES. THIS BILL WOULD FORCE PRIVATE COMPANIES TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE WAGES AND OTHER TRADE SECRETS THAT COULD BE USED BY COMPETITORS LOOKING TO STEAL CUSTOMERS OR FILE. FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS FOR ANY OF A NUMBER OF REASONS SB SEVEN FORTY NINE DIRECTLY JEOPARDIZES CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY LAID OUT IN ARTICLE ONE SECTION. THREE OF OUR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THIS BILL HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES NOT ONLY CONCERNING PERSONAL PRIVACY BUT ALSO THE COST OF EMPLOYERS AND BUSINESSES. IF AN EMPLOYEE OF THE CONTRACTING BUSINESS DOES NOT WANT THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION TO BE DISCLOSED THE EMPLOYER WILL BE HELD FINANCIALLY AND LEGALLY LIABLE FOR DISCLOSING IT. MANDATE IN THE DISCLOSURE PRIVATE INFORMATION COULD ULTIMATELY DISCOURAGE PRIVATE EMPLOYEES. FROM SEEKING CONTRACT PRIVATE PLAYERS FROM SEEKING CONTRACTS OF AGENCIES THAT'S LEAVING THE GOVERNMENT WITH YOUR OPPORTUNITIES TO FULFILL THEIR NEEDS FOR THESE REASONS I URGE THE MEMBERS OF PLEASE VOTE NO ON SB. SEVEN FORTY NINE THIRTY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING ON CENTER DRAWS YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH REGARDS TO MY COLLEAGUES -- REMARKS. SB SO FORTY NINE DOES NOT DOES NOT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS. TO MAKE PERSONNEL RECORDS PUBLIC. IN FACT IT SPECIFICALLY PROTECTS THE DISCLOSURE OF EMPLOYEE NAMES AND OTHER PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WE HAVE CASES IN PUBLICS WORKS OF CONTRACTS AT WITH A CONTRACTORS AN EMPLOYEE AND BUSINESSES. IN WHICH THEY ARE OF A DISCLOSE THAT KINDOF INFORMATION ON THE JOBS AND THE AND THE WAGES. THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T BE APPLIED ACROSS THE BOARD AND NO ONE HAS STOPPED MAKING BIDS FOR THE FOR THOSE CONTRACTS. I DON'T THINK THEY'LL DO IT NOW IF THEY WANT THE CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.
