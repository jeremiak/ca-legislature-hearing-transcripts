SEEN THUS FAR ACTUALLY FROM MY

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:45.997
PERSPECTIVE WOULD CREATE MORE IN

00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:47.766
EQUITY IN FACT IT WOULD TAKE A

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.235
LOT OF MONEY AWAY FROM LA U. S.

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.304

FROM OTHER ANTELOPE VALLEY

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:55.140
EXCEDRIN I DON'T THINK WOULD

AND PASS THAT AROUND THE STATE

00:23:00.812 --> 00:23:01.913
WILL DISTRICTS MIGHT SAVE THAT

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.181

DISTRICTS SAVING BOND MONEY --

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:07.986

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:08.887
THAT MONEY.

00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:09.988

THIS BILL IS ABOUT SMARTER

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:45.710

TESTING WORKS AT A SCHOOL SITE

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:43.401
OFTEN YEARS YOUR SCHEDULES ARE

COLLEGE ATTENDANCE RATE.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.009
IN FACT LONG BEACH UNIFIED WHICH

FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY.

00:27:37.555 --> 00:27:38.957
THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:40.558
OF TESTING GIVE GIVE STUDENTS

TEACHERS I CAN ASSURE YOU OF

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:48.833
THAT.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.601
THEY'RE SMALLER NOW THIS IS A

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:51.036
KEY POINT THIS IS WHY I LIKE

00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:52.470
THIS THE SUPERINTENDENTS GONNA

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:53.138
SURE OF THE REASONS THEY MY LIKE

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:53.805
THIS.

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:55.206
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THIS IS ONLY

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.274
ABOUT GETTING MORE KIDS INTO

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:58.443
COLLEGE YES IT IS BUT THIS IS

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.978
KEY TO ME AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:01.713
THE SMARTER BALANCED TESTS THE

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.181
SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT IS

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.683
ATTACHED IS A TEST THE SAT IS AN

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.652
INCEST THE SAT OR ACT IS AN

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:10.188
ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. TO HELP STE

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:11.956
TO HELP ADDRESS GAPS IN STUDENT

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:14.926
LEARNING THE PSA T. OR SAT OR

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.061
ACT RATHER.

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:16.995
GUY CAN BE GIVEN IN THE EIGHTH

00:28:17.062 --> 00:28:18.897
GRADE AND SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:19.998
STARTED JUST YOU GIVE TO KIDS IN

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:23.201
EIGHT GRADE NINE GRADE TEN GRADE.

00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:24.035
AND YOU CAN SEE.

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:24.669
WHERE THE GAPS ARE YOU CAN WORK

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:25.303
TO CLOSE THEM DURING THOSE HIGH

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.970
SCHOOL YEARS?

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.872
THE ASPECT TEST WE GIVE NOW IS

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:28.973
NOT AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM IT'S A

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.508
SUMMATIVE TEST AT THE END OF THE

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:31.342
YEAR.

00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:32.877
THIRD THROUGH EIGHTH AND THEN

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:34.946
ELEVEN BUT THE PAC TEAR THE SAT

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.182
YOU CAN GIVE AGAIN AND EIGHTY

00:28:37.248 --> 00:28:38.149
NINETY TEN THE PRETEST IN YOUR

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.784
AGAIN YOU CAN IDENTIFY.

00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:41.719
THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS NOW AS

00:28:41.786 --> 00:28:43.054
ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED THE

00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:45.356
ASPECT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN

00:28:45.423 --> 00:28:47.025
ASSESSMENT SYSTEM YOU LOOK AT

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:47.759
THE ORIGINAL CODE SECTION.

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:48.726
IT TALKS ABOUT IT BEING

00:28:48.793 --> 00:28:51.196
ASSESSMENT SYSTEM IT IS NEVER

00:28:51.262 --> 00:28:52.130
DEVELOPED INTO AN ASSESSMENT

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:53.998
SYSTEM THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.600
THAT REALLY IMPACTS STUDENT

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:57.435
LEARNING AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER.

00:28:57.502 --> 00:28:58.837
ALSO GETTING AT THE END OF THE

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.538
YEAR TASK FOR THE ASPECTS SYTEM

00:29:00.605 --> 00:29:01.539
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR US BUT WE

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:02.640
NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WOULD AND

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:03.575
THAT WE CAN -- THAT WE CAN

00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:05.276
EMPLOY THROUGHOUT THE YEARS THAT

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:06.945
WE CAN ASSESS STUDENTS AND AGAIN

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.213
HOPE CLOSE THOSE ACHIEVEMENT

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:11.216
GAPS AND THE THE PS EIGHTY

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:11.916
EIGHTY EIGHT THE PAC TEAR THE

00:29:11.983 --> 00:29:13.985
ACT OR THE ACT REALLY IS AN

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:15.120
ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT BUT

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.688
THAT'S WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. TO

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:17.956
ME BECAUSE I CAN IDENTIFY MUCH

00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:20.425
EARLIER THAN JUST THAT THAT ONE

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:22.494
YOUR TEST WHAT I NEEDED TO LIVE

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.798
BY STUDENTS TO HELP THEM CLOSE

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:28.199
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS.

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:28.933
LET ME ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.034
CONCERN NUMBER ONE THE SAT OR

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:31.035
ACT DOES NOT ALIGN.

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.303
WITH THE STATE'S CONTENT

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.539
STANDARDS UNDER THIS BILL THE

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.007
STATE SUPERINTENDENT MAY NOT

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:37.342
AUTHORIZE AN ALTERNATE

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:39.344
ASSESSMENT UNLESS IT HAS BEEN

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.279
DEEMED. TO MEET THE STATE'S

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:43.047
CONTENT STANDARDS BASED ON

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.049
APPROVAL FROM THE US DEPARTMENT

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.718
OF EDUCATION THEY HAVE TO

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:48.586
APPROVE THIS.

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:49.687
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:52.056
THERE IS NO ONE TEST NOT EVEN

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:52.991
THE S. BACK.

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:55.126
THAT IS COMPLETELY ALIGNED TO

00:29:55.193 --> 00:29:56.628
COMMON CORE STANDARDS.

00:29:56.694 --> 00:29:58.029
EACH OF THE THIRTEEN COMMON

00:29:58.096 --> 00:29:59.864
COURTS STATES MAY HAVE CHANGED

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:01.566
OR ADDED TO THE STANDARDS BUT

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.902
THE S. BACK IS THE SAME TEST.

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.537
FOR ALL THOSE STATE EVEN THOUGH

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:07.071
THEIR STANDARDS MAY NOT BE THE

00:30:07.138 --> 00:30:08.039
SAME.

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:10.208
A STUDY BY MICHAEL KERR LANDER

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.310
AND KRAMER CONE FROM UC DAVIS

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:14.779
I'M PREDICTING COLLEGE SUCCESS.

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.181
CONCLUDES THAT THE S. BACK AND

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:18.650
SAT ARE ALIGNED.

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:19.784
SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:22.253
SCORES DO NOT PREDICT FIRST YEAR

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.988
DO NOT PREDICT FIRST YOUR GPA

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:26.191
AND SECOND YOUR EXPERIENCE RATES

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:28.860
AS WELL AS S. A. T. SCORES.

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:31.095
BUT THE DIFFERENCE A MAGNITUDE

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:31.930
IS TRIVIAL.

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:34.332
SO THEY BOTH WORK ONE OTHER

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:36.167
POSSIBLE X. AN EXPLANATION FOR

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:37.602
THESE FUNDAMENTAL SIMILAR IS IS

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.637
THAT THERE IS AN OVERLAP AND THE

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:41.739
KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS ASSESSED BY

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:43.474
THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT

00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:44.509
AND SAT.

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.678
THEY HAVE CONCLUDED.

00:30:46.744 --> 00:30:49.747
IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.015
THIS BILL REQUIRES THE SAME

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:53.418
REPORTING FOR ALTERNATIVE SCORES

00:30:53.484 --> 00:30:55.253
AS THE ASPECTS SCORES THE SCORES

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.621
CAN BE A LINE THROUGH CONCORD

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.523
AND SAY SO THE STUDIES TO ALIGN

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.859
THE SCORES. TO GET A SAT OR ACT.

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:03.861
SCORE FOR EACH S. BACK

00:31:03.928 --> 00:31:05.330
PERFORMANCE LEVEL.

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:07.065
IF IT CANNOT BE DONE THIS BILL

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:08.633
CANNOT BE IMPLEMENTED PER THE

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.269
BILL -- CONCERN NUMBER TWO THE

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:13.705
SAT IS CULTURALLY BIASED AND

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:15.273
GRADES ON BUILDERS.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.075
THE SAT RESERVE WAS REDESIGNED

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:19.110
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ALIGN WITH

00:31:19.177 --> 00:31:20.578
THE COMMON CORE STANDARDS.

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:21.779
AS AN ACHIEVEMENT TESTS THE

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:24.249
SCORES ARE NOT A SIGN ON A BELL

00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:26.918
CURVE TWENTY SIXTEEN IT STOPPED.

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.586
WE SHOULD NOT EXPAND THAT ONE OF

00:31:28.653 --> 00:31:29.354
THE OTHER ARGUMENTS WE SHOULD

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.256
NOT EXPAND THE USE OF ADMISSION

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:31.956
TESTS.

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.098
AND APPLAUD EFFORTS LIKE THE

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:36.600
ONES THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:37.835
ABOUT FREE AS THE T. DAY.

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:40.037
OF THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THIS

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:41.105
BILL I'LL I'LL.

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:43.407
LIFT UP TO CONCERNS THAT WE

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:45.910
THINK -- RESULT IN A NET

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.578
NEGATIVE WHEN YOU DO WHEN YOU

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:49.580
LOOK AT ALL THE TRADE OFFS

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:50.281
INVOLVED WITH THIS BILL.

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:51.615
FIRST HAS TO DO WITH

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:54.084
COMPARABILITY OF SCORES.

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.853
WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.588
UNDERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:59.156
OUR NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IN

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.325
THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD.

00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:03.460
AND THAT RELIES ON BEING ABLE TO

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:05.229
COMPARE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:07.064
ACROSS DISTRICTS AND THEN

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:08.933
HOLDING DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.901
COMMON STANDARDS. FOR STUDENT

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.369
ACHIEVEMENT.

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.705
SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SAYS

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.373
THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE ONE SET

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.242
OF TESTS AND SOME DISTRICTS IN

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.677
THE DIFFERENCE THAT.

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:21.145
IN OTHERS.

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.347
IN PROPONENTS MAY ARGUE THAT THE

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:25.749
THE SCORES CAN BE CORRELATED AND

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:28.385
WE CAN USE THEM INTERCHANGEABLY.

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:29.620
WE DISAGREE WITH THAT AND WE

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:30.921
THINK LOTS OF THINGS CAN BE

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:33.490
CORRELATED -- BUT STILL BE VERY

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:34.959
DIFFERENT HEIGHT AND WEIGHT CAN

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:36.360
BE CORRELATED BUT THE

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:37.628
OBSERVATION OF WHAT YOU'RE

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:39.296
LOOKING AT IS STILL VERY

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:40.264
DIFFERENT.

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:42.666
SO WE THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:44.268
SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA USE

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.637
DIFFERING TESTS FOR THE SAME

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:47.972
PURPOSE IN THE DASHBOARD AND

00:41:48.038 --> 00:41:48.839
THAT'S GOING TO WEAKEN OUR

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:50.708
ABILITY TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.176
IN DISTRICTS AND SEE.

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.444
WHETHER DISTRICTS ARE PREPARING

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.179
STUDENTS NOT ONLY TO TAKE THE

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:57.181
TEST BUT GAME ADMISSION AND

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:59.250
SUCCEED AT THE POST SECONDARY

00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:01.619
LEVEL -- AND REMEMBERED THE NEW

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:04.455
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IS A

00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:06.590
PASSIVE ONE TRANSPARENCY IS

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:08.292
REALLY ALL WE HAVE GOING FOR IS

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:08.692
THAT.

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:10.194
THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL IN A

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:12.963
DISTRICT THE ABILITY TO SEE THAT

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.365
IS REALLY ALL WE'VE GOT.

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.733
AND IT'S GOING TO CLOUD THE

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:17.501
ABILITY OF THE STATE TO DIRECT

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:18.802
SUPPORTS WHAT WE THINK IT'S

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.037
NEEDED.

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:23.073
SECONDLY WE SEE BIG PROBLEMS

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.208
WITH THE S. A. T..

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:25.809
THE DATA DON'T LIE WHEN YOU LOOK

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:28.279
AT OUTCOMES AFRICAN AMERICAN AND

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:31.548
LATINO STUDENTS SCORE BELOW.

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:33.050
ASIAN AND WHITE PEERS.

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:34.652
WHAT THIS BILL WOULD

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.754
DRAMATICALLY TO IS THE ESCALATOR

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.656
OR INCREASE THE USE OF THE S. A.

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:41.091
T. IN PUBLIC EDUCATION BOTH BOTH

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:43.127
AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL?

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:45.629
AND A KEY -- TWELVE WE THINK

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:47.498
THAT'S A MISTAKE.

00:42:47.564 --> 00:42:49.800
WE THINK THAT -- THE RECENT

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:51.368
COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL JUST

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:53.470
KIND OF REMINDED US WHAT MANY

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:55.272
RESEARCHERS HAPPENS TELLING US

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:56.840
FOR A LONG TIME IS THAT.

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.108
OTHER MEASURES ARE VALUE

00:42:58.175 --> 00:43:00.611
AVAILABLE LIKE HIGH SCHOOL GPA

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.846
OR EVEN HIGH SCHOOL GPA IN

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.315
COMBINATION WITH S. BACK WERE

00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:06.350
RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:08.485
THIS BILLS PROLIFERATING -- A

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:11.021
BARRIER TO HIGHER EDUCATION BIG

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:14.124
BY BOLSTERING THE S. A. T. THAT

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:15.459
DATA SHOW ARE.

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.661
THE SAT IS KEEPING STUDENTS OUT

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.263
WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED A HIGH

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:23.734
PROBABILITY FOR SUCCESS -- WE

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:24.535
THINK A DIFFERENT APPROACH LIKE

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:25.636
WHAT'S EMBODIED IN A RESOLUTION

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:28.005
BY MR MCCARTY IS A PREFERABLE

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:30.341
WAY TO GO YOU OUGHT TO BE ASKING

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:31.875
THE SYSTEMS TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:33.811
BEST A TEA IN ITS SHORTCOMINGS.

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:34.979
AND IF THEY FIND WHAT

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:36.580
RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN TELLING US

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:38.849
FOR QUITE SOME TIME PHASE THAT

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.350

OF REVIEWING ALL CAPS BUT WE

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:45.862
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:46.996
AUTHOR TO MITIGATE THOSE

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:47.964
CONCERNS THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:52.935
IN SUPPORT.

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:53.503
ANSWER ANY OPPOSITION TO THE

01:02:53.569 --> 01:03:05.414
BILL. TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES

EACH BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY.

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.292
GOOD MORNING I'M CALLING MILLER

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.293
THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.528
ASSOCIATION WHERE UNFORTUNATELY

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:20.630
OPPOSE THIS BILL -- I WOULD NOTE

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:22.565
THAT -- THE EDUCATION TRAILER

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.233
BILL THAT YOU'LL BE --

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.936
CONSIDERING DOES ADDRESS ON ALL

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.337
THE ISSUES AROUND TRANSPARENCY

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:29.839
THEY'RE INCLUDED IN THS BILL A

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.541
WE DO SUPPORT -- INCREASE

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:33.042
TRANSPARENCY IN MAKING SURE THAT

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:34.777
TURNER SCHOOLS ARE ENGAGING

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.012
THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THE IN

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.881
THESE PROCESSES -- THE EL CAP IS

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:40.483
AN EVOLVING PROCESS IS YOUR YOUR

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.918
OWN STAFF ANALYSIS NOTES THERE A

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.719
LOT OF ISSUES WITH DISTRICTS IN

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:44.987
TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE ENGAGING

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.255
THEIR COMMUNITIES AS WELL.

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:47.857
SO WE THINK THAT ADDING CHARTER

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:50.092
SCHOOLS TO ALL THOSE LAWS AND

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.128
VERY PRESCRIPTIVE PROCESSES --

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:53.396
THAT DISTRICTS ARE APPLYING ARE

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:55.898
REALLY NOT A SOLUTION TO THIS

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:59.035
ISSUE OF IN OUR COURAGE IN MORE --

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:01.971
BORN GAUGE WENT -- THE JOINT

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.105
LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:06.709
ALSO RECENTLY -- GOOD CONTRACTED

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:09.212
TO OF THE BSA FOR AN EVALUATION

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:10.513
OF THIS ISSUE AS WELL -- PUBLIC

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.747
ADVOCATE'S REPORT DID NOT

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.816
INCLUDE DISTRICTS SO WE DON'T

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:15.885
KNOW HOW OF PERVASIVE THESE

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:16.519
ISSUES ARE AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.754
AS WELL -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:21.457
THAT -- IN ADDITION TO YOUR OWN --

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.559
AS BE ONE TWENTY SIX THE

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:24.327
TRANSPARENCY ISSUES IN CHARTER

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.695
SCHOOLS ARE IMPROVING -- THIS

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:27.663
BILL WE THINK IT JUST GOES TOO

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.999
FAR IN TERMS OF CREATING SOME

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.834
VERY PRESCRIPTIVE --

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.169
REQUIREMENTS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:35.338
THAT HAVEN'T YET BEEN -- BEEN --

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.206
PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE -- ALSO

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:38.407
JUST TO BE CLEAR CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.209
ARE DIFFERENT THAN SCHOOL

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:42.478
DISTRICTS THEIR SCHOOL LEVEL

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.879
ACCOUNTABILITY -- THERE ALSO

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.748
HAVE BEEN DOING ACCOUNTABILITY

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:49.318
BASED ON GOALS AND OUTCOMES FOR

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.253
FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE CAP

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:51.887
ADDED ON TO THAT PROCESS.

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.322
THE BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THIS

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:55.424
BILL AS IT ACTUALLY ELIMINATES

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:57.193
THE THE SECTION OF LAW THAT

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.861
WOULD INCLUDE CHARTER SCHOOLS --

01:04:58.928 --> 01:04:59.829
THAT THAT REQUIRE CHARTER

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:02.498
SCHOOLS TO ALIGN THEIR CHARTERS

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.600
WITH THEIR ALL CAPS BY LIMITING

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:05.635
THAT SECTION LOG COMPLETELY.

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:07.436
IGNORES THE FACT THAT CHARTER

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:08.671
SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.006
KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.274
THEIR CHARTER PROCESS.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.041
THAT ARE APPROVED BY THEIR

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:22.418
DISTRICTS AND AND AND OUR LOCAL

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:23.486
BASED ACCOUNTABILITY SO SO WE WE

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:24.353
REALLY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:24.887
ELIMINATION OF THAT THAT

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.422
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CHARTER

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.024
AND THE ALL CAP IN THIS BILL.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.191
YOUR NEXT WITNESS HELLO HALLERAN

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.359
WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:30.993
DEVELOPMENT CENTER SO I ECHO

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:31.560
EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUE

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:32.495
SAID IN ADDITION I JUST REALLY

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:33.696
WANT TO EMPHASIZETHE FACT.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.431
THAT PRIMARILY CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:37.066
ARE BEHOLDEN TO THEIR CHARTER

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.367
AND THAT CHARTER HAS ALL SORTS

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:40.136
OF PUBLIC HEARINGS AND TIME FOR

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:41.037
INPUT.

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.238
THAT'S THE DOCUMENTS THAT

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:43.572
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE BEHOLDEN TO

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.341
UNLIKE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.276
SCHOOLS SO WHEN WE ADD ON

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:49.211
ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT IS

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.047
DIFFERENT IN LOTS OF WAYS FROM

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:51.847
THE CHARTER DOCUMENT.

01:05:51.914 --> 01:05:53.783
IT DOES LEAD TO SOME CONFUSION

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.284
AS TO WHAT DOCUMENT REALLY

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:56.886
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE BEHOLDEN TO

01:05:56.952 --> 01:06:00.289
AND IF THE EL CAP CHANGES -- THE

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:01.524
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARTER

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.025
TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS DON'T GO

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.527
THROUGH THAT PUBLIC HEARING

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:06.362
PROCESS OR WRITE A CHARTER SO

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:08.864
IT'S IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY CLEAR

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:10.733
AND AND WHEN THE ORIGINAL EL CAP --

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.035
LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN IT

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.270
TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT --

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.638
THAT IT LOOKS TO THE CHARTER

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.139
DIFFERENTLY THAN TRADITIONAL

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:18.541
SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF PRESENTING

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.309
THAT AL CAPP DOCUMENT.

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:22.378
SO -- I I JUST THINK WE NEED TO

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:23.145
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT I

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:25.348
THINK THAT THIS THIS PARTICULAR

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.049
BILL FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:28.918
A CHARTER SCHOOLS DO -- CAPS NOW

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:33.456
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THIS MORE

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:34.390
ELABORATE PROCESS.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.491
THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:36.792
BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO SAY SCOTT

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:37.893
HER SCHOOLS ALREADY DO YOU HAVE

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.161
TO DO AN EL CAP I THINK WITH

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:40.563
THIS BILLS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:41.297
IS MAKING SURE THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:42.331
GETTING DONE.

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:44.400
AS WE HEARD THAT SO MANY OF THEM

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:46.068
ARE BEING DONE SO THANK YOU VERY

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:48.504
MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.106
OPPOSITION.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.107
SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.375
TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.910
COMMENTS CONCERNS.

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.645
ALL RIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE TO COOK.

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:59.782

WEEK KNOW THAT -- COM AND THEN

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:06.655
MAYBE MAYBE QUESTIONS COULD BE

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:09.392
IN THIS SO -- FOR ME CHARTER

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:11.694
SCHOOLS ARE LIGHT DIFFERENT

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:12.361
BECOMES.

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:13.329
THE FOCUS ON HOW COME BASS AND

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:15.998
AS MENTIONED -- BY THE OPPONENTS

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:16.832
THAT'S ALL DONE TO THE CHURCH

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:19.201
THROUGH THE CHARTING PROCESS AND

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:21.137
SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE TRYING.

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:22.938
TO TAKE -- WHAT'S OUTCOME BASE

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.673
AND AND TRY TO MAKE IT RULES

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.841
BASE WHICH IS.

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:26.776
REALLY PART OF PROBABLY THE

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:29.078
GENERAL EDUCATION SYSTEM I MEAN

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:30.212
I THINK WE GOT GREAT TEACHERS

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:32.415
ADMINISTRATORS CLASSIFIED

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:33.115
COMMITTED WITH A SCHOOL BOARD

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:34.350
MEMBERS.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:36.552
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE.

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:37.420
IT IS JUST A STEPPING THE I

01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:38.954
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO ABOUT IT

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:42.658
IT'S ONE SIZE. ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:43.492
YOU KNOW TOP DOWN DRIVEN.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:44.994
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.929
NECESSARILY BENEFITING -- OUR

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:48.798
OUR STUDENTS IN A WORLD WHERE

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:50.499
THEY DON'T HAVE TO NOW NO ONE

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:51.767
THING THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:52.935
FOR ANYTHING.

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:53.669
AND IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE AND I

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:54.970
THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.872
DIVERSITY IN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:57.940
I LIKE TO SEE CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:07:58.007 --> 01:07:59.141
CONTINUE TO PROSPER.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.110
I ALSO LIKE TO SEE A REGULAR

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.579
SCHOOLS DO DO BETTER.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:05.448
SOMEONE I WAS READING THE BILL

01:08:05.514 --> 01:08:07.316
ARCHER I JUST HAD AN EPIPHANY

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:07.983
AND SO WHAT THROUGH IT OUT THERE

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:09.785
NOT FOR NOW BUT FOR NEXT YEAR

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:10.453
AND I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:11.687
IT BECAUSE I THINK OU.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.556
ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO DO IT

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:17.893
BASED UPON YOUR YOUR EXPERIENCE.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.527
MAYBE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:19.295
CHARTER SCHOOLS MORE LIKE

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:20.296
REGULAR SCHOOLS MAYBE WE SHOULD

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:21.130
MAKE GREATER SCHOOLS MORE LIKE

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:22.531
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND MAYBE WE

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.966
COULD SIT DOWN.

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:26.669
AND TRY TO COME UP WITH THINGS

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:29.338
THAT HELP REGULAR SCHOOLS.

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:30.873
THAT MAKES THE THE BECAUSE I

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.007
HEAR A LOT THAT THE PLAYING

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:33.609
FIELD IS NOT LEVEL MAYBE THERE'S

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.578
THINGS THAT WE COULD DO THAT

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:37.213
WOULD MAKE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.347
FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW.

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:40.015
THEY CAN BE MORE COMPETITIVE AND

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.116
ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT HELPS

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.351
STUDENTS SO I CAN'T I CAN'T BE

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:43.652
WITH YOU ON THIS BILL TODAY I

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:44.220
DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:45.221
APPROACH.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.957
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE COMMITTED.

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:50.292

NEXT YEAR ON THINGS.

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:58.734
THAT RELIEVES THE REGULATORY

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.402
BURDEN WHEN APPROPRIATE ON

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:03.239

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:48.203
WHAT WAS HEART BREAKING IS THAT

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.671
THEY WERE OFTEN ASHAMED TO ADMIT

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:51.206
THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW HOW

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.407

BUT UNTIL RECENTLY WE DIDN'T

REALIZE TO WHAT EXTENT

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:10.225
HOMELESSNESS WAS IMPACTING A

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:11.192
VERY DIFFERENT GROUP OF

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.627
CALIFORNIANS.

AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS ALSO

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:18.600
KNOWN AS BASIC NEEDS AND

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:21.069
SECURITY IS FINALLY GETTING THE

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.137
ATTENTION IT DESERVES.

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:23.672
STUDENTS OF COLOR FIRST

FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE AT MUCH

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.578
HIGHER RISK OF EXPERIENCING

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:32.314
BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.648
A RECENT REPORT RELEASED BY THE

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:34.683
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:36.418
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE HOPE

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.053
CENTER FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.588
JUSTICE WHICH SURVEYED NEARLY

FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT FIFTY

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:43.391
SEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.894
FOUND THAT 19% OF RESPONDENTS

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.429
EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS IN THE

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:48.997
PRIOR YEAR.

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:50.165
IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT THE

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.299
CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:52.500
POPULATION OF TWO POINT ONE

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.069
MILLION STUDENTS THIS MEANS THAT

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.037
ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.539
STUDENTS STATEWIDE HAVE

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:59.040
EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS.

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.675
IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.310
THIS NUMBER IS NOT ONLY SHOCKING

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:04.012
ALARMING AND TRAGIC BUT IT MUST

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:06.014
BE A CALL TO ACTION.

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:07.248
I INTRODUCED AB THREE OR TWO

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.983

WITH HOMELESSNESS.

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.255
AB THREE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:15.523
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PROVIDE A

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.692
SAFE PARKING LOT ON CAMPUS FOR

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:18.960
THE HOMELESS STUDENTS TO SLEEP

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.662
IN THEIR VEHICLES.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:22.097
EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.431
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO GRANT

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:24.799
HOMELESS STUDENTS ACCESS TO

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:26.468
CAMPUS OUR FACILITIES.

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.536
AB THREE OH TWO IS THE NEXT STEP

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:29.037
IN HELPING THIS GROWING

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:30.572
POPULATION.

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:31.973
UNDER AB THREE OR TWO EACH

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.074
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WILL

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:35.243
BE PROVIDED BROAD FLEXIBILITY TO

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.678
DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.046
THAT MEETS THEIR LOCAL NEEDS AND

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.714
CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.316
AB THREE OR TWO ALSO IMPORTANTLY

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.084
SPECIFIES THAT IT IS THE INTENT

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:44.285
OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT HOMELESS

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:46.287
STUDENTS WHO USE THE OVERNIGHT

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:47.689
PARKING FACILITIES.

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:49.224
CONNECTED TO AVAILABLE STATE

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.492
COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:52.127
DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY BASED

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.629

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.197
ASSISTANCE RESOURCES.

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.866
LET ME BE CLEAR.

01:23:57.932 --> 01:23:59.067
AB THREE OR TWO IS NOTHING TO

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:00.001
CELEBRATE [inaudible]

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:02.170
IT'S SAD.

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:02.804
THE FACT THAT WE'RE EVEN

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.272
ISCUSSING THIS IS A REFLECTION

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:06.307
OF CALIFORNIA'S FAILURE OVER THE

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.709
LAST THIRTY YEARS TO BUILD A

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:09.744
HOUSING NECESSARY TO MEET THE

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.813
NEEDS OF OUR GROWING POPULATION.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.515
BUT WE CAN'T LOOK AWAY OR AVOID

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:14.816
THIS ISSUE JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.451
US FEEL AWKWARD.

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:18.052
THE REALITY IS THAT STUDENTS ARE

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:19.554
SLEEPING IN THEIR VEHICLES OR

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:20.422
EVEN OUT ON THE STREET.

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:22.290
TONIGHT.

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:24.359
AND WHEN WE DON'T TO PROVIDE A

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:25.693
SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO SLEEP.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.128
WITH A MOAN AND OPPOSE A SHORT

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:28.530
TERM SOLUTION LIKE SAFE LOTS

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:29.764
BECAUSE WE SAY WE'RE WORKING

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:31.332
TOWARDS THE LONGER TERM SOLUTION

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:33.168
OF BUILDING HOUSINGFOR THEM.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.538
AND THREE TO FIVE YEARS.

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:37.472
WE FORCE THEM INTO THE SHADOWS.

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:38.506
IN THE DARK ALLEYS AND

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:40.475
INDUSTRIAL PARKS WHERE THE

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.811
STUDENTS ARE MOST VULNERABLE.

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.112
AS I MENTIONED I I WANNA THINK

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:45.780
THE CHAIR IN HER COMMITTEE STAFF --

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:46.848

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:56.458
STEP TO TAKING STATEWIDE ACTION.

01:24:56.524 --> 01:24:57.192
TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:59.494
CRISIS THAT MANY OF OUR

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.196
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE.

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:02.096
I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:04.833
FOLLOWING KEY COMPONENTS.

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:06.267
ADDING A MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:07.969
THAT A STUDENT MUST BE ENROLLED

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:09.604
IN TO USE THE OVERNIGHT PARKING

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:12.467
AND IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE THE

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:13.902
TURN OUT FROM THE COLLEGE'S

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:15.136

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.476
HELP THEIR STUDENTS.

01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:22.310
I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERY

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:24.145
COLLEGE ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:25.947

SORT OF INCLUDED AB THREE OR TWO

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.392
IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:39.060
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS.

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:40.662
BUILDING MORE HOUSING IS.

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.130

HOMELESS SLEEPING IN MY CAR

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.185
PRIMARILY.

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:38.786
I WAS A FULL TIME STUDENT DURING

I WAS STILL NOT ABLE TO AFFORD.

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:58.172
A HOUSE A PLACE TO LIVE IN AND

01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:00.241

CAMPUS WHEN I WAS SLEEPING IN MY

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.445

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:06.981
TIMES BY POLICE AND AS A RESULT.

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:08.116
I WOULD SLEEP IN THE NEARBY

WAS DAMAGED.

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:20.561
PENALIZED BY PEOPLE IN THE AREA

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.463

I ENDED UP PARKING FURTHER AND

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:30.204

BACK TO SHOWER TO START MY DAY

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:36.344
BEFORE WORK AND CLASS.

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:38.112
HAD AB THREE TWO BEEN IN EFFECT

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:39.213
I WOULD HAVE A LOT I WOULD HAVE

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.515
BEEN ALLOWED TO STAY NEAR THE

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:43.017
RESOURCES THAT EXIST ON CAMPUS.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:44.986
SUCH AS FOOD PANTRIES SHOWERS

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:46.688
AND HEALTH SERVICES.

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:48.022
SHOULD HAVE CUT DOWN MY COMMUTE

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.758
TIME ALLOWED ME TO SLEEP MORE

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:54.395

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:05.673
FROM POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:08.676
WITH SCHOOLS BEING ONE OF THE

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.545
FEW STABLE AND SAFE ENVIRONMENTS

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:12.246
THAT CAN ALLOW STUDENTS TO

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:13.347
OBTAIN THE ACADEMIC SKILLS.

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:14.749
THEY NEED TO ESCAPE FROM POVERTY

01:29:14.816 --> 01:29:16.584

EVENTUAL BACHELOR'S DEGREE.

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:23.891
CAN MEAN THE WORLD TO THEM.

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.560

THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:39.841
HELLO GOOD MORNING HOW TO START

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:40.475
BY SAYING ALL THANKFUL I AM TO

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.143
BE HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.245
THE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:44.846
STUDENTS WHO FACE HOMELESSNESS

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:45.847
LAST YEAR.

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:47.915
MY NAME IS ANTHONY WHITE I'M

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:48.716
TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD I'M A

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:50.718
FATHER A HUSBAND.

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:52.386
A STUDENT AND A VETERAN.

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.555
I'M ALSO FORMALLY HOMELESS.

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:55.456
SURELY AFTER LEAVING THE MARINE

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.924
CORPS MY PLANS DID NOT WORK OUT

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:58.192
AND I FOUND MYSELF LIVING IN MY

01:29:58.259 --> 01:29:59.961
TRUCK FOR MY PICKUP TRUCK FOR

01:30:00.027 --> 01:30:01.429
ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS IN THE NORTH

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:03.331
SAN DIEGO COUNTY AREA.

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:04.499
I WORK DURING THE DAY WOULD

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.300
ATTEND CLASSES IN THE EVENING.

01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:07.335
I WORKED HARD TO GET OTHER

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:08.903
SITUATION I WAS IN WHAT WAS A

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:11.005
CONSTANT STRUGGLE. ONE OF THE

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.440
BIGGEST CHALLENGES I FACED WAS

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:13.074
FINDING A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP AT

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:14.275
NIGHT.

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.743
I ONLY WANTED TO BE SAFE SO I

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.044
CAN SLEEP UNDISTURBED AND ON

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:19.046
DISTURBING.

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.815
I WOULD PARK IN FRONT OF LOWS

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:21.415
BECAUSE THE WIFE I REACHED THE

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:22.150
PARKING LOT.

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:23.951
SO I COULD DO MY HOMEWORK.

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:24.919
OR I WOULD PARK BEHIND

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.354
WAREHOUSES IN THE BUSINESS PARK

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:28.489
IN OCEANSIDE BOULEVARD BECAUSE

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:29.056
THEY WERE WELL LET CLOSE TO

01:30:29.123 --> 01:30:31.125
CAMPUS.

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:32.994
IF AB THREE TWO HAD BEEN LAW.

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.162
I WOULD HAVE HAD ACCESS TO MY

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:36.664
COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO PROGRAM

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:37.431
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIFE

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:38.099
CHANGING.

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:38.599
AND MAY HAVE MEANT THE

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:40.935
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME STAYING IN

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.370
SCHOOL OR DROPPING OUT.

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.405
WHICH ULTIMATELY DID BECAUSE OF

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:45.006
THE STRESS OF THE SITUATION I

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:46.908
WAS IN.

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.543
THANKFULLY IS A VETERAN I HAVE

01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:49.610
ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT MOST

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:52.146
STUDENTS DON'T.

01:30:52.213 --> 01:30:52.747
AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND STABLE

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:54.448
HOUSING.

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:55.616
SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN ENROLLED IN

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:56.951
SCHOOL AND ON MY WAY TO COMPLETE

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:59.353
MY BACHELORS IN BUSINESS.

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.788
BUT TONIGHT MANY STUDENTS WILL

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.790
STILL BE IN THEIR CARS.

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:04.058
FACED WITH THE CHOICE OF WHERE

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.060
TO PARK FOR JUST ENOUGH TIME TO

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:07.862
CLOSE THE RICE AND FILL THAT

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:09.463
MOST BASIC HUMAN NEED OF A SAFE

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.465
NIGHT'S SLEEP.

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:13.768
I'M HERE TODAY TO DISPEL SOME OF

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:14.735
THE STIGMA SURROUNDING

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.370
HOMELESSNESS.

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:18.306
I AM HERE AS A TRUE TO LIFE

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:20.408
EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF STUDENTS

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:22.743
WHO NEED AB.

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:23.778
THREE OH TWO THESE ARE THE SAME

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:24.478
STUDENTS THAT ARE IN OUR

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:25.513
CLASSROOMS.

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.281
THEY'RE ON OUR CAMPUSES

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:29.283
INTERACTING WITH US EVERY DAY.

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.518
THEY'RE NOT DRUG ABUSERS FOR THE

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.053
SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL.

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:33.421
BUT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WANT

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:35.489
A BETTER WAY OF LIFE.

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:37.225
LIKE MANY OF YOU I BELIEVE THAT

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:38.759
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHOULD BE A

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:41.062
GATEWAY TO A BETTER FUTURE.

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.496
AND THAT BASIC NEEDS SHOULDN'T

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:44.932
BE A BARRIER TO EDUCATION.

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:45.933
BEING HOMELESS IS EXTREMELY

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.969
LONELY.

01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:49.370
AND I OFTEN SAY BEING HOMELESS

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:50.671
MEANS BEING IN THE COMMUNITY

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:53.507
WITHOUT BEING A PART OF IT.

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:54.909
BUT AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:57.044
SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HEART.

01:31:57.111 --> 01:31:58.446
IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS THAT I HOPE

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:53.026
THE THE POINT IS THAT THE SENSE

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:53.827
IT'S IN THERE.

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:55.228

THINK THEY'RE GONNA OFTEN AND

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:56.897
THE OTHER THING I THINK THIS

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:57.931
COULD BE AN EDUCATIONAL

01:48:57.998 --> 01:48:58.498
PROPOSITION FOR THE GENERAL

01:48:58.565 --> 01:49:00.767

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:02.569
THE STUDENTS BECAUSE I FIGURE I

01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:04.437

THREE MONTHS -- IN MY COLLEGE

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:10.043
DAYS.

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:10.677
I THINK IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:13.246
GENERAL PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND

01:49:13.313 --> 01:49:14.648
WHAT.

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:16.182
THE HOMELESS IMPACT IS BECAUSE I

01:49:16.249 --> 01:49:17.083

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:47.947
BOTH AT HOME AND OTHER PLACES I

01:59:48.014 --> 01:59:49.582
BELIEVE -- AND DOCTOR MANY IT'S

01:59:49.649 --> 01:59:51.217
MORE THE EXPERT BUT I BELIEVE --

01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:55.988
ACTUALLY -- TODDLERS -- SHOOT.

01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:57.657
THERE THE PEOPLE ARE SHOT BY

01:59:57.723 --> 02:00:00.359
TODDLERS AT LEAST WEEKLY.

02:00:00.426 --> 02:00:02.962
AND UNITED STATES.

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:03.896
SO THINK ABOUT THAT TODDLERS

02:00:03.963 --> 02:00:05.531
WERE ABLE TO GET ALL THE GUN AND

02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:06.399
SHOOT SOMEONE WEEKLY.

02:00:06.465 --> 02:00:07.400
I THINK WE CAN PRESUME THAT WAS

02:00:07.466 --> 02:00:07.967
NOT INTENTIONAL.

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:08.935
BUT THE FACT THAT THEY COULD

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:11.704
ACCESS TO A GUN AND AND BE ABLE

02:00:11.771 --> 02:00:12.572

SHOOT SOMEONE IS SOMETHING.

02:00:16.642 --> 02:00:17.410
THAT WE SHOULD GIVE PAUSE TO AND

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:18.611
I THINK CERTAINLY IS --

02:00:18.678 --> 02:00:20.179
PEDIATRICIAN -- THEY KNOW THE

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:21.280

02:30:37.862 --> 02:30:39.764
AS THERE'S A LITTLE CONCERNING I

02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:41.298
MEAN IT THAT THE THE ACADEMIC

02:30:41.365 --> 02:30:42.199
TEAM THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:30:42.266 --> 02:30:43.534

THAT'S WITH A NUMBER OF A PRESS

03:00:42.231 --> 03:00:43.899
OF TACTICS -- THIS INCLUDED FOR

03:00:43.966 --> 03:00:45.234
EXAMPLE PULLING STUDENTS OUT OF

ALSO INCLUDED WITHHOLDING

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:52.041
TRANSCRIPTS TO PREVENT STUDENTS

03:00:52.107 --> 03:00:53.642
FROM FLEEING CORINTHIAN TO

03:00:53.709 --> 03:00:55.110
CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AND

03:00:55.177 --> 03:00:57.613
MORE LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS ARE

03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:59.281
ACTUALLY LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS.

03:00:59.348 --> 03:01:00.482
OUR EXPERIENCE INVESTIGATING AND

PROSECUTING FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS

03:01:02.618 --> 03:01:04.153
IS WHAT PROMPTED THE ATTORNEY

03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:05.387
GENERAL TO SPONSOR THIS BILL.

03:01:05.454 --> 03:01:07.456
UNFORTUNATELY THE STRONG ARM

03:01:10.492 --> 03:01:11.827

WITHHOLDING TRANSCRIPTS

03:01:17.099 --> 03:01:18.667
INTERFERES WITH STUDENT CHOICE

03:01:18.734 --> 03:01:20.135
INTERFERES WITH STUDENT MOBILITY

03:01:20.202 --> 03:01:21.837
AND THEREFORE IT HARMS

03:01:21.904 --> 03:01:23.706
COMPETITION AMONG SCHOOLS.

03:01:23.772 --> 03:01:24.940
IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT

03:01:25.007 --> 03:01:26.542
THREATENS THE LIVELIHOOD OF

03:01:26.609 --> 03:01:27.943
STUDENTS BY BLOCKING FURTHER

03:01:28.010 --> 03:01:29.845

03:01:31.714 --> 03:01:32.681
THE VERY THINGS WOULD ALLOW

03:01:32.748 --> 03:01:34.216
STUDENTS TO SUCCEED AND MAKE

03:01:34.283 --> 03:01:35.184
ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY BACK THEIR

03:01:35.251 --> 03:01:37.086
DEBTS.

03:01:37.152 --> 03:01:37.653
WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS SO

03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:40.456
IMPORTANT SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE

03:01:40.522 --> 03:01:42.057

AND THIS IS A LOT OF TIMES

03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:55.691
BEFORE THEY HAVE FINISHED THEIR

03:08:56.758 --> 03:08:57.759
YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW GRADUATE

03:08:57.826 --> 03:08:59.061
