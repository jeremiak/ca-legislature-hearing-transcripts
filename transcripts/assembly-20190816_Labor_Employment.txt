I'M STATUS SOMEONE ASH KALRA CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO OUR FIRST INFORMATIONAL HEARING BEFORE THE THIS SESSION ANDS I'M VERY HAPPY TO HAVE A ALONG WITH ME AS A MEMBER KANSEN CHU AND ON HIS WAY IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT THERE ARE A FEW MEMBERS OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC BUT MOST OF THEM REPRESENTS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ANOTHER ONE OF SACRAMENTO WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY LABOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS UP IN OUR DIRECT ASSUME THE ALTHOUGH SOME RICH YOU USED TO BE ON THE STATE LABOR COMMITTEE IS VERY INTERESTED IN ISSUES WHEN POWERING WORKERS AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS. FOR EVERYONE. I AM. ADDITIONALLY HAPPEN THAT WILL BE WILL BE G. JOINED A DURING THE COURSE THE MORNING BY OTHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CITY AS WELL AS THEY COME ALSO I'LL BE CERTAIN. TO INTRODUCE SOME WE ALSO EXPECT THE SPEC BETTY YOUNG WAS A DIRECT THE SENECA COUNTY OFFICE OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. WILL BE OUT ALSO COMING IN THIS MORNING AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO HAVE WITH US TOM PIKE REPRESENTING CONGRESS MEMBER WELL KINDA AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE ROSE ROCK I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU. ARE VERY WELL AWARE THAT ROSE SHOWED A GREAT INTEREST IN SUPPORT FOR COOPERATIVES IS A HAVING THAT STATE. FEDERAL AND OF COURSE LOCAL SUPPORT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. ON ISSUE OF THIS NATURE. AND SO. AS CHAIR OF LABOR COMMITTEE ONE OF THE AND I WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO BE APPOINTED. IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. BY OUR SPEAKER OF THE AND ANTHONY RENDON AND ONE OF ANY ADDITION TO THE- THE HEAVY VOLUME OF BILLS THAT. INVOLVE WORKERS INVOLVED LABOR AND ALL AND AN EMPLOYERS. THAT WE HAVE TO SIFT THROUGH. AND HAVE HEARINGS ON DURING THE COURSE YEAR. I WANTED TO HAVE A LARGER CONVERSATION AND SPECIFICALLY HOLD HEARINGS AROUND THE STATE. ON THE FUTURE OF WORK. AND IT IN MANY DIFFERENT ARENAS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE STATE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. BUT WITH INFORMATION HEARINGS OF THIS NATURE ON A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS BUT THIS IS THE FIRST ONE WE'RE DOING ON THE ON THE FUTURE OF WORK. AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY. TO START BY A BY TALKING ABOUT WORKER COOPERATIVES BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WERE COOPER'S PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. IN A MOVIE WHAT A IN OUR ABILITY. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SO SUSTAINABLE WORK FORCE GOING INTO THE FUTURE. AND SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT DOING A DEEPER DIVE INTO THIS AND FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T AWARE INFORMATION HEARINGS. ARE HEARINGS THAT. STANDING COMMITTEES SUCH AS THE LABOR COMMITTEE. MCCANN HOLDEN DO HOLE DURING THE COURSE HERE OFTENTIMES ARE IN STOCK BACK MOST TIME THEIR SACRAMENTO. BUT I'D MAKE IT A POINT TO TRY TO HAVE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO GET TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO HEAR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES FROM AROUND THE STATE. OUR STATE IS A VERY DIVERSE ONE AND WE CERTAINLY. WANT TO HAVE A TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PERSPECTIVES BEYOND JUST OF THAT. ARE IN SACRAMENTO OR OR PART OF THE CAPITAL ENVIRONMENT. AND WHAT WE DO WITH THESE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IS THAT WE TAKE THAT INFORMATION. AND THEN WE USE IT BOTH IN TERMS OF. OF CRAFTING LEGISLATION. AS WELL AS BUDGET ASKS OR IN GENERAL JUST TO HELP EDUCATE. THE MEMBERS ALLEGE THE LEGISLATURE ON CRITICAL ISSUES THAT UP TO GOING INTO THE FUTURE. THIS IS BEING LIVE STREAM AND IT WILL ALSO BE ARCHIVED I WANT TO MAKE MENTION OF THAT SO THAT. I JUST SO YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS AND IN PARTICULAR THEIR STAFF. AND THE OFFICES THAT WILL BE. PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS AND I WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO GAIN FROM SOME OF THE WISDOM OF SOME OF THE CONVERSATION FROM TODAY. SO IT'S THE REACH WILL BE FAR BEYOND THOSE ARE SIMPLY IN THIS ROOM. AND I THINK THAT. IT'LL BE BUT I THINK I HOPE OF BEGINNING. THE BEGINNING OF A VERY ROBUST. CONVERSATIONAL WORKER COOPERATIVES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND OF AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THERE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A LOT OF MOMENTUM IN SANTA FE SANTA CLARA COUNTY. TO ENCOURAGE THIS BUSINESS MODEL. AND WILL CERTAINLY HEAR THAT OF FROM. OUR PANELISTS WE HAVE TWO PANELS OF FOR TODAY. I'LL BE WILL BE ADOPTED HER CARE ABOUT WORK COOPER IS AND HOW THEY GIVE WORKERS MORE CONTROL INVESTMENT IN SETTING THE TERMS CONDITIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. AND CALIFORNIA'S IS CERTAINLY HAD A COP CROSSROADS WITH NUMEROUS SMALL BUSINESSES PROJECTED TO CLOSE AS OWNERS RETIRE. AND WE NEED TO POSITION OURSELVES RESPOND TO THAT AS WELL. I AND SO BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL A LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO MEMBER KANSEN CHU IF YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INSURED CAR UP THIS IS REALLY A VERY.

THANK YOU SUMMER SHOULD I DO THINK THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ESPECIALLY IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IS INVALUABLE AND HAS PROVED INVALUABLE OVER THE YEARS IN YOUR SERVICE IN THE CITY IN THE STATE. AND I THINK ON THIS ISSUE WILL CERTAINLY OFFER A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE THAT THAT MANY OF US THAT SERVE DON'T HAVE. AND SO I LIKE TO I WAS GOING TO JUMP IN AND WELCOME OUR FIRST PANEL AND I'M NOT GONNA GIVE ANY OF A LONG INTRO ALLOW ALLOW THEM TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES THE ORGANIZATIONS THEY REPRESENT. AND JUST FOR THE- AUDIENCE AWARENESS EACH PANELIST OF BOTH IN THIS PANEL AS WELL AS A SUBSEQUENT PANEL HAD ABOUT. SIX SEVEN MINUTES TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND PRESENTS AND THEY'LL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AS WELL AS A FROM THE AUDIENCE BUT WE DO HAVE.

SO ON OUR FIRST PANEL WE HAVE RICARDO NOON YES OF THE US FEDERATION OF WORKER COOPERATIVES AND THE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIES LAWCENTER. AS AN TRÊN HOME BUT THE DEBATE. DEMOCRACY AT WORK INSTITUTE. HILLARY IN. ABOUT THE HILLARY ABOUT A PROJECT EQUITY AND RICHARD HOBBS OF HUMAN AGENDA SO BOOK. THAT IS A YEAH WE HAVE IT WILL BE NO RICHARD VERY WELL NOW FROM A NUMBER OF YEARS LIBERTIES AND HUMAN AGENDA. AND SO RICARDO MONEY JUST. TAKE IT OFF. AND LET'S GO DOWN THE LINE AS YOU ARE PERCENT. THANKS EVERYBODY FOR COMING TONIGHT LIKE TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COLOR AND TO FOR MAKING THE TIME AND THE REST ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT AREN'T ABLE TO BE HERE. AND FIRST I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE ALL THE LOCAL WORK THAT'S BEEN GOING ON HERE TO GET US TO ACTUALLY HAVE SPACE AND HAVE. A VOICE IN THE COMMUNITY HERE TO BE SPEAKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. SO AGAIN MY NAME IS RICARDO NOON YES I AM FROM THE OR REPRESENTING RIGHT NOW THE STATE OF WHERE US FEDERATION OVER COSTS I'LL GET TO THE LAS AND IN A SECOND. AND SO. I'M THE BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF WORKER COOPERATIVES HERE'S THE REST OF THE BOARD WEIRD DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED. BY OUR MEMBER WORK PLACES FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND THE US FEDERATION OF WORKER COOPERATIVES IS THE ONLY NATIONAL GRASSROOTS MEMBERSHIP BASED ORGANIZATION FOR WORKER COOPERATIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. SO OUR PARTNERS OUR SYSTEM IS A- DEMOCRACY WORK INSTITUTE WE ARE WORKING TO CULTIVATE AN ECOSYSTEM. THAT SUPPORTS THE GROWTH OF DEMOCRATIC EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND WHAT IS A COOPERATIVE THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOPERATIVES IS HOUSING COOPERATIVES CONSUMER COOPERATIVES TODAY WERE TALKING ABOUT WORKER COOPERATIVES IN ALL TYPES OF COOPERATIVES ARE GUIDED BY VALUES THEIR VALUES ALIGN BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKER COOPERATIVES ARE DEMOCRATICALLY RUN. WORKER OWNED BUSINESSES SO THE MEMBERS OF WORKER COOPERATIVE ARE THE WORKERS THEMSELVES. THERE WERE COOPERATIVE NATIONAL LANDSCAPE IS THAT WE ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND WE ARE GROWING SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN EXPLOSION OF KRISTEN FINDING NEW ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO BUILD EQUITY. ASSET LINK TO IN OUR THIRTIES WORKER COOPERATIVES ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO. ARE YOU CAN SEE THAT. THE AVERAGE WORKER COOPERATIVES PAY DOUBLE THE MINIMUM FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE PAY MORE THAN THE CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE SO WITHOUT THE BUT BY SELF ORGANIZING AND SETTING OUR OWN TERMS WE ARE ACHIEVING BETTER THAN STANDARD WAGES. AND WE GET TO DEFINE THE RULES OF OUR WORKPLACES SO WE GET TO DEFINE DIGNIFIED WORKPLACES FOR OURSELVES. AS FAR AS DEMOGRAPHICS WE ARE THE FUTURE OF WORK OTHER WORKER COOPERATIVES SPECTER. ELITE ARE PREDOMINANTLY. MEN AND LOVE CAUGHT BLED AND ACTUALLY LARGE GROWTH IN WORK PROPERTY NATIONAL IS WITH IMMIGRANT THIRTIES LOOKING TO FIND ACES THERE WERE IN THE BODY THEY CAN'T PULL THEM. THEY WILL BE EXPOSED AT THAT CAN CONTROL LABOR. WHAT INDUSTRY WORKER BUT IS IT WE'RE IN ALL THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IT'S GEN THREE OH IT'S JUST BECAUSE SHOPS AND BAKERIES EVEN THOUGH I LOVE THOSE. THEY ARE IN AYE IN CONSTRUCTION MANUFACTURING RESEARCH AND DESIGN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. ALSO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE SECOND PANEL ABOUT HOW FUNDAMENTAL THIS SHIFT IN IN PRACTICES IN THESE INDUSTRIES WHAT THE IMPACT CAN HAVE ON ON ACTUAL PEOPLE WHERE. FOLKS WILL STAY IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN A BAKERY FOR YEARS AND YEARS EVEN DECADES BECAUSE AS OF THE CONTROL THAT THEY HAVE OVER THERE LABOR AND THE BENEFITS THAT THEY CAN PAY THEMSELVES. AND WORKER COOPERATIVES ARE NOT A SILVER BULLET THEY'RE PART OF A LARGER JUST TRANSITION WE ARE WORKING WITH NEWS AROUND THE CUT THE FIRE IS OF OTHER. TO LEAVE THE LEG BE EXTRACTED A COP ME AND BUILD THE TO SEE. I CAN TELL TO REGENERATIVE STORE. ECONOMIES COMMUNITY. AND ALSO WORKER COOPERATIVES ARE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE WE HAVE NATIONAL LEGISLATION PASSED LAST YEAR THE MAINSTREAM PUT PRESSURE BACKED WHICH DIRECTS THE BUSINESS MINISTER GEN I AM PAYS THEM I'M TO LAND TO WORK OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM GROW. I'M A SECOND HAD THAT I'M WEARING TODAY IS THE DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY FOR SUSTAINABLE. ASCENT I'M HERE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY A DEMOCRATICALLY RUN ORGANIZATION AND ADVISE OTHER NON PROFITS ON HOW TO RUN DEMOCRATICALLY THEMSELVES. AND WE PROVIDE EDUCATION RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY FOR HIS ACCOUNT MASON SO WE'RE LOOKING TO FIND WAYS TO CREATE SYSTEMS THAT MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS ENVISION A DIFFERENT CULTURE ALL THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT WE ARE CREATING IN OUR WORKPLACES IN IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND FINDING WAYS THOSE LEVERAGE POINTS. IN THE LAW THAT WILL ENABLE US TO MOVE FORWARD AND BUILD A REGENERATIVE ECONOMY. WELL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO LEAVE AN EXTRACT OF ECONOMY. AND WE'RE LAWCENTER WE LOOK TO THE LOT TO FIND WHAT IS THE EXISTING ACCOUNT BASED ON AND IT'S A STOP. NEXT THING IS NOT. VALUE FROM BUSINESS PEOPLE AND GIVING IT APPS. DON'T PROVIDE THERE MOST THE TIME DON'T PROVIDE THEIR LABOR AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO SHIFT TOWARDS ONE WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMPENSATED FOR THE LABOR AND FOR THE VALUE THAT THEY'RE GIVING THEM THEIR WORKPLACES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND SO IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS DANIEL ECONOMIES LAWCENTER WITH. A HOST OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE TOMOXIA INSTITUTE. WE ARE THE US VERY COOPERATIVE HAVE AN LEVEL JUST LISTEN TO THE FOR THE WAY TO CREATE. A COMPLETE FINISHED IN ALL FOUR SO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE PASSED A LAW CREATING THAT CALIFORNIA WORKER COOPERATIVE CORPORATION ACT WHICH CREATED A LEGAL ENTITY FOR WORKER COOPERATIVES IN CALIFORNIA THIS DID A FEW THINGS BUT- ONE THING IT DID WAS IT ENABLED LOCAL AND REGIONAL POLICY ADVOCACY EFFORTS TO ACTUALLY HAVE. GET MOMENTUM AND HAVE A FOUNDATION WE DIDN'T HAVE A DEFINITION OF WHAT A WORKER COOPERATIVE WAS AND SO NOW WHEN WE GO TO CITIES AND ADVOCATE FOR CITY SUPPORT REGIONAL SUPPORT FOR WORKER COOPERATIVES WE HAVE A LEGAL DEFINITION. AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD FROM. AND ALSO PART OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IS NOT ONLY BUILDING THOSE LAWS BUT ACTUALLY EMPOWER PEOPLE TO SEE THAT ELVES AS- THE ADVOCATE. ON THE ELVES AND SO WE COULD AND WORKER OWNERS. FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA. HELD CONVERSATIONS WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF THE LAW THAT ARE REALLY IMPACTING YOUR WORKER COOPER BUSINESSES AND SO WE HAD AT WORKERS. COMPENSATION INSURANCE CAMPAIGN WHICH I WILL GET INTO RIGHT NOW WHERE WE WERE ADVOCATING WITH WORKER OWNERS TO CHANGE THE LAW FROM SOME CHANGES THAT HAD DONE BEEN DONE PREVIOUSLY AND THROUGH THIS EFFORT UNFORTUNATELY. WE DIDN'T GET THE EXEMPTION THAT WE WANTED AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN PROVIDE IS. A WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. EXEMPTION THAT WORKS. THE WAY THAT THIS CAN BY PORT IS. MITCHELL IN FACT WE START WORKING THESE COMPANIES. TWO TWO FIVE THE WAY YOU MOVE THERE. I DIDN'T ASK THIS TIME BUT IT TO BE A FIVE P. THAT WOULD CREATE A FRIENDSHIP PROCUREMENT FOR EMPLOYEE OWNED BUSINESSES FUNDING FOR STATE CENTER FOR EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP AS WELL AS PUBLIC AWARENESS PUBLIC EDUCATION AND ASSISTANCE FOR CONVERSIONS AND WORKER COOPERATIVES IN GENERAL ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS FOR THE THIS MODEL THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IT EXISTS. AND SO THE STATE CAN REALLY PROVIDE A LOT OF SUPPORT IN GETTING THE WORD OUT AND HELPING US PROVIDE. SOME PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AROUND THIS MODEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RICARDO I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME WE HAVE CONSUMER JOHNNY CAM THIS WHO WHO'S HERE WITH US. AS WELL AS US LAST WALKER WITH SENATOR JIM BELLS OFFICE. CONNECTS. HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AN CHEN HOME AND AS A SLIDER BEING PULLED UP BY MY COLLEAGUE HERE. WHAT INTRODUCED MYSELF WHEN I'M HOPING TO BILL TO COVER IN THE NEXT SEVEN MINUTES. I WAS ON PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE SHARED EQUITY IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. AT THE DEMOCRACY AT WORK INSTITUTES WERE MOVEMENT BASED THINKING DO TANK COMMITTED TO EXPANDING WORK ON A SHIP FOR COMMITTEES MOST IMPACTED. BY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY SO THOSE ARE RECENT IMMIGRANTS SLOW WHICH WORK FORCES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. SOME HOPING TO COVER TODAY IS A LOT OF GROUND. SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE FEDERAL WORK THAT'S HAPPENING WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT WHY WE EVEN IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE A LOT LOCAL WORK THAT'S HAPPENING. AND IS IMPORT ROLE THE STATE'S PLAY. ONE HOPING TO SHOW TODAY IS A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH CITIES IN OUR FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. AND WHAT WE LEARNED IN WORKING WITH CITIES IN ADOPTING THIS TOOL AS AN EQUITABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL. AND WELL HOW THAT'S PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION HAVING ON THE COUNTRY ABOUT HOW CAN WE USE WORKER OWNERSHIP AS A STRATEGY TO. DO NUMBER OF THINGS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE WORK AND THE SAME TIME. FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THAT POINT WHILE ADDRESSING. THE HISTORIC LEGACY OF DISINVESTMENT AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT FOR MANY PEOPLE. SO THE SET IS SHARED EQUITY. IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. IT'S OKAY I GOT THIS THINKS. ALL OF OUR AGAIN FANTASTIC. BEAUTIFUL AND EASY PEASY IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR ME SO THE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ALL AND THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES. IT'S A CESSATION OF MEANNESS GOVERNMENT THE CITY COUNCIL ON THE CUT. I'M WE CAN THE LAST YEAR AND I DID FOR PLEASE JOIN TWENTY COAL. ON TOP OF MY AND. AND WHAT ELSE I'M ALL FOR CITIES FOLKS DAHLE. VERSIONS TO IMPLEMENTED SHIP HELPING RETIRING OWNERS WE DO NOT HAVE A SUCCESSION PLAN FORGOT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO SELL THE BUSINESS OR EMPLOYEES THERE BY KEEPING THE JOBS THERE. KEEPING THE COMMUNITY INTACT ENSURING THAT THESE EMPLOYEES NOW BECOME OWNERS AND THEREFORE CAN HAVE A STAKE IN COMMITTEE FOR THE LONG TERM. THIS YEAR WE'VE PARTNERED WITH FOR NEW CITIES TO WORKING WITH LOCAL. RICHMOND VIRGINIA. DEFINITELY GO AND INTENDED. AND ALL OF THEM ARE JERRY KING AND BANISH IT WILL BE MORE BROADER THAN JUST HASN'T BEEN SHIPPED. SOME OF MY LOOK A LOOKING AT HOW DID YOU START UPS AND FOOD ON SEVERAL SPACES. SOME ARE LOOKING AT HOW TO USE EMPLOYER SHOULD ACTUALLY CREATE NEW FORMAL HOUSING UNITS SO. KIND OF NEW FEEDING TWO BIRDS. WITH ONE SCONE TO USE THE NONVIOLENT ALTERNATIVE. AND THE REASON THEY'RE ALL DOING THIS WORK RIGHT. IS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO THE FROM TO. PRACTICE WHICH. BUT SOMETIMES CAN EXACERBATE THE VERY END QUOTE THE CITY. LOOKING FOR TOOL THAT CAN REALLY HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS AGAIN THAT LEGACY DISINVESTMENT AND INEQUALITY AND IN AND IN THE IN THE IN THE MEANTIME BE ABLE TO BUILD ASSETS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY OPEN SURE THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND THAT WAS **** IN COMMITTEE FOR THE LONG TERM RIGHT THEY DON'T LOSE THEIR CULTURAL I TELL THE IF A LONG RUNNING BUSINESS THAT'S PLEASE PROVIDE SERVICES FOR DECADES. YOU KNOW DISAPPEARS. SO CITIES. AGAIN ARE USING PARTNERSHIP IN MANY WAYS ONE WAS USING IT WITH TOP PRIORITY. SMALL BUSINESS CLOSURES SPENT ON HIS RIGHT HIP HELLO PLEASE DO WORK ONE POINT. HIS MIAMI SO THAT THEY DON'T ANY OF THEM SHIP IT'S IMPORTANT POINT HERE. MY IT DOES NOT HAVE. IT'S A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION TO HAVE GIVEN THE POLITICS IN THE AREA AND YET THERE WILL TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A BUSINESS CASE FOR WORKERS OWNING THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND HELPING OWNERS SELL TO THEIR EMPLOYEES SO THEY FUNDED THREE LOCAL TECHNICAL SYSTEM ORGANIZATIONS TO DO EARLY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL. TO THIS WORK AND THE USE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT MONIES TO CBG MONEY TO HELP FINANCE POTENTIAL DEALS AND ALL LAUNCHING AWARENESS RAISING A BUSINESS OUTREACH CAMPAIGN WITHOUT WITH PROJECT EQUITY ACTUALLY. AS PART OF THAT WORK. OTHER CITIES ARE ALSO LOOKING AT EMPLOYERS OF AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. SO THIS IS A HIGHLIGHT HERE IS DOOR ON CAROLINA SO ALL THE FOCUS IS ON. ASIA SHIP ALSO DEAL WITH THAT IT'S. ONE OF THE BLOCK ST STE. IN AMERICA. OVER A YEAR HISTORY BLACK SUNDAY. AND BUSINESS CLOSING EVERY TIME I DO THAT CONNECTED SURE OF THAT TO THAT LEGACY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY I'M INSURE THAT AS THE CITY GROWS AFTER AMERICAN COMMUNITY. OF THAT GROWTH AND SO THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NARROW THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND CONNECT PEOPLE. TO GROWING BUSINESS. AND THEN OF COURSE CITIES ARE DRESSING IMMIGRANT POINT. SO THE ONE CITY THAT OFTEN COMES UP A LOT OF THIS WORK IS BEEN DOING IT FOR SO LONG AS NEW YORK CITY. THEIR SIX YEAR FIND A- BASS YOU KNOW. WE'RE COOPER DEVELOP ISSUE FUNDS THAT SOMEONE IN A LETTER TO FOR ORGANIZING AND GIVEN HERE. YOU CAME INTO SYSTEMS UP AND AN ONGOING SERVICES ON ITS IN LARGELY THIS IS PART OF THE YOU KNOW ANTI POVERTY GENDER THE MAYOR AND OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND IT YOU KNOW AS AS YOU KNOW RICARDO SHOWED THE GROWTH WORK ON SHIP IS WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOT AND MOST NEW WORK OWNERS. COMING ON YOUR CITY DO THE FUNDING ARE WOMEN OF COLOR. SO SOME EFFECTIVE CITY TOOLS THAT ARE BEING WORKED ON SO. ALL THE CITIES ARE DIFFERENT WHAT DO GIVEN OUR POSITION. WE CAN CONVENE WE NORMALLY AS IN WE RESOURCE RIGHT. WE NEED WHAT IT IS HAVE WE POUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BUSINESS IT'S JUST THE- CITY AND STATE. WHAT THIS IS THIS IS NEED ONLY GIVEN BASIS THE AGE OF OWNERS YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY SOME OF EVEN THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE INDUSTRIES THAT SMALL BUSINESSES COMPRISE. THIS IS NOT HOW THEY'RE THEY'RE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA OFTEN SO IF THERE'S A FOR THE CITY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WORK AROUND STRATEGIES ACTUALLY COLLECTED SMALL BUSINESS DATA TO BE ABLE TO TARGET. BUSINESSES WHERE THE OWNERS ARE YARN MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YOU FEAR OF OWNING THE BUSINESS AND FIGURE OUT HEY DO YOU NEED SUPPORT TO FIGURE OUT YOUR SUCCESSION PLAN WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING. EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. THAT'S PART OF THE OUR RICH EDUCATION AND OF COURSE COMES AFTER THAT AND SO CITIES HAD TO WORK THROUGH. OUTSIDE TACKLE SYSTEMS PARTNERS I HAVE TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY. THE HAVE THOSE. VERY SENSITIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THAT'S ALSO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. TO ACTUALLY HELP SUPPORT THE CAPACITY OF TECHNIQUES IS A PROVIDERS AT SUPPORTING. BUSINESS OWNERS IN CONVERTING. AND IT'S THE FINANCING WILL. BE ABLE TO MOVE CBG MONEY FOR EXAMPLE TO HELP FINANCE DEALS. AND REDUCE BARRIERS TO THOSE PROGRAMS. SO THESE ARE SOME EXAMPLES I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SO. I KNOW THAT ALL OF US I'M SURE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE OUR PRESENTATIONS LATER ON BUT YOU KNOW ALL THE CITIES ARE USING A PLAN SHIP IT REALLY NOVEL WAYS. AND THE COMMON CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT EMPLOYERS SHOULD HIS NEW MANY COMMUNITIES. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY VISIT MUCH BUSINESS DATA THAT THEY CAN TARGET. IS A FUN AND TING WHICH I'M SURE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT LATE LENDERS OFFICIALLY SCOTT. WILL FINANCING BUSINESSES MORE OWNERS. CLIFFORD EVENING I'M IS. WHO NUMBER. OF HE- COULD HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE IT IS TO. INCLUDE COPIES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORK IS I DON'T HAVE THE COLLATERAL COVER LOANS. AND THAT IS BECAUSE SAID. CONVERT EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP IS NOT A SILVER BULLET. IT'S TIED TO ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES. AROUND FUTURE WORK AROUND PRESERVING AFFORDABILITY. AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO. LIVE AND THRIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND STATES AND THIS IS MY FINAL SLIDE HERE HOW STATES CAN SUPPORT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT SO RICARDO SHED A LOT HERE AND I'LL I'LL. JUST ECHO. NOTE WE NEED TO FIND. AND THIS STATE OWNERSHIP IN IT. CALIFORNIA Y. EDGY REACH OUT AND IT'S NOT JUST WHAT IS IT WE NEED HIM OUT COMMUNITIES IS IT DOESN'T POOR IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT ROLE COMMITTEES WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESSES AND ONE SHUTS DOWN. WHERE THE JOBS GOING TO GO WE NEED PROVIDE LOAN FUNDS LOAN GUARANTEES INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESS TRANSITIONS TO WORK ON A SHIP THEIR EXAMPLES AND STATES ON THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED TO DISSEMINATE EDUCATION MATERIAL AND HELP FUND WORK ON **** TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SO THAT'S YOUR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS THAT. AND NOW THE MANDATE BY THAT TO BE A TO SUPPORT OWNERS IN EXPLORING PLANET SHIP. AN INCREASE THE TAX ABATEMENT PROGRAMS FOR GROWN BUSINESSES THAT WILL THAT THE OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THIS I BELIEVE IT'S MISSOURI IS ONE OF THEM. WHERE THE HAVE INCENTIVIZE THE CELL OF A BUSINESS TO EMPLOYEES TO ENSURE THE BUSINESS STAYS THERE. AND PLEASE HAVE ASSETS IN FORD SO. I'M EXCITED TO TALK MORE SHOW MORE. YOU KNOW AFTER AFTER A CONVERSATION. THINK THANK. YOU SO MUCH SEN. HILLARY ABOUT THE PROJECT. WE COULD SWITCH SEAT YEAH YEAH. GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARP COLOR AND SHE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR HOSTING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT HEARING. IT DOES GET SITUATED HERE. I AM NOT GOOD ON THE- SAME. THANK YOU. GREAT SO I'VE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN WORKER PROPERTIES FOR A LONG TIME TWENTY FIVE OR SO YEARS AGO I WAS A WORKER OWNER AT ONE FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE I'VE BEEN WORKING. WITH REQUIRE DEVELOP AND. WELL I HOPE FOUND PROJECT WOULD BE YEARS AGO MY COLLEAGUE. TODAY AND WE ARE GONE IN THE FALL. HELLO HE'S EXTENDING RUNNERS HAMMER MODEL WHICH WERE PRESENT ON THE MIDDLE MIDDLE WORKERS WERE BASED IN OAKLAND WERE WORKING NATIONALLY AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THING SOME SOME DEEP PARTNERSHIPS WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CITIES AND ALSO EXPANDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR WORK IS A LOT ABOUT RAISING AWARENESS AND BUILDING THE ECOSYSTEMS SO WE'RE CURRENTLY PARTNERING IS AND MENTION BUT THE CITY OF MIAMI AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH. HERE IN THE BAY AREA WITH BERKELEY FREMONT AND SAN FRANCISCO. AND WE SEE THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL SO MOVING FROM THE GREAT CITY ENGAGEMENT WORK THEM THE GROUPS LIKE PROJECT ACT I'M LIKE A DEMOCRACY WORK INSTITUTE AND WE ARE DOING AND OTHERS AS WELL. TO ALSO ENGAGING STATES THERE'S INTERESTING WORK ALREADY HAPPENING IN DIFFERENT STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT THIS PROJECT EQUITY ALSO. PROVIDES FULL SERVICE SUPPORT TO COMPANIES THAT ARE ASSESSING IN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING CONVERSIONS TO BROAD BASED EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. AND WE'VE HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING WITH SOME COMPANIES IN THE ROOM TODAY LIKELY KIRK FROM SLICE OF NEW YORK WHO WILL SPEAK. ON THE NEXT PANEL. I'M I'M ALSO AFFILIATED WITH THE CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP IT IS A FLAT AN ORGANIZATION. SORT OF BORED IT'S JUST. GOING BUT WE'VE PARTICIPATING ON BOARD AND- I'M ARE ADDED TO. THAT ORGANIZATION. FOR THEIR MISSION IS TO WEAR A AN EMPLOYEE. THE STATE. I'M AS BOTH ASSEMBLIES MENTION ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MENTIONED WHEN WE STARTED WE ARE FACING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY THE GLOBAL HE HAS ALL I'M DEMOCRATS SHIFT NOT ONLY IN THE I'M READ. THE ABOVE OUR FOURTH OF OUR POPULATION NUMBER. SO AGE WHAT TO BE BOOMERS RETIRE IN SOUTH AMERICA THEY ARE RETIRING AND THE WOMAN AND IS KNOWN MANY TO SELL THEIR NAMI. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE IMPACT ON BUSINESSES BABY BOOMERS OWN. ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MRS IN OUR STATE THEM BY ALMOST THREE MILLION ALL. I'M IS SEE THAT THEY'LL OF THIS COME THESE ARE. THEN SIX IN. LIZ IS OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THE ANSWER. ECONOMIC FORCE AND BECAUSE OF MOST PEOPLE ARE HUMAN MOST BUSINESS AND AS A HUMAN THEY DON'T PLAN VERY WELL INTO THE FUTURE FOR THE LONG TERM RIGHT OR AT LEAST FOR THEIR RETIREMENT AND SO MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES ACTUALLY ARE CLOSING. SOME ARE BEING PURCHASED BY COMPETITORS OR BY LARGER CORPORATIONS AND THAT OFTEN REALLY UNDERMINES THE LOCAL ROOTS OF THOSE COMPANIES AND OFTEN CREATES LAYOFFS AND OTHER OTHER CHANGES THAT ARE NOT VALUABLE THANK NOT HELPFUL TO COMMUNITIES. IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY 15% OF BUSINESSES THAT SUCCEED TO THE NEXT GENERATION THESE DAYS. AND BECAUSE OF THIS AND TIRING SIX OUT OF TEN OUR PLAN TO SELL COMPANIES AND THEIR NOT LOOK TO THE POTENTIAL BUYERS UNDER THOSE UP RIGHT IN OFFICE OR FACT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THEY WERE. EVERY OUR POTENTIAL BUYERS AND AS WE'VE ALL MENTIONED THERE'S AN IMMENSE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO CONVERT THESE BUSINESSES TO BROAD BASED EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. JUST A BRIEF WORD ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT. BY BROAD BASE WE MEAN THAT THIS IS NOT A MAN BY THIS IS A BALLOT THAT ALL EMPLOYEES WHO BASIC OF OCCASIONS IN THAT ARE YOU A FULL TIME REAP BURKE X. THE WEEK BEEN WITH THE COMPANY AT LEAST HERE. THOSE QUALIFICATIONS. I'M NOT A DEGREE AS- LEVEL OR YOU KNOW MANAGE PROBLEM. I'M ALSO THAT THE PROFITS ARE SHARED IN REAL TIME BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THERE'S ANOTHER MODEL OF EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP THAT DOES FOCUS ON RETIREMENT SAVINGS WHICH IS VITAL THAT'S THE SOP. AND SOME OF THOSE ALSO DO WHAT ALL WORKER COOPERATIVES DO WHICH IS TO SHARE PROFITS EVERY YEAR WITH WITH THE MEMBER OWNERS. THIS QUESTION OF IS BROAD BASED EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP DEMOCRATIC JUST A BRIEF REFERENCE IN WORKER COOPS IT IS BECAUSE THE WORKING MEMBERS CONTROL THE BOARD AND MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF BOARD MEMBERS. THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED ALSO IN OTHER FORMS OF EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP LIKE THE SOCK. SO VERY BRIEFLY JUST AN OVERVIEW. HERE WHICH CAN TODAY PRIMARILY ABOUT WERE COOPERATIVE. THE BEST MODEL. DOCTOR PLAN IS THERE ARE STEVEN THOUSAND COMPANY IN THE CASE TODAY PASSAGE PLAN. I'M OF A 100% OWNERS. SOME OF THEM A SMALL NUMBER BUT IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT GREAT CREDIT PRACTICE INTO SOME AS WELL AND THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP TRUST THAT HAS BEEN PRACTICED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR MANY YEARS AND IS ANYWHERE IN THE US THAT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL OPTION. THERE THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF DATA. I TAKE THE- STATUS I THOUGHT UP MANAGED TO. I'M IN MY OWN BEFORE JACK DEPUTY WORK. INCLUDE BUSINESSES HE IN THE SEX IS THE BAY AREA THAT WORKERS AND CALL BENSON NATIONAL HEARING CENTERS A. T. WHICH IS ALSO. A GREEN BUSINESS AND DAVE SMITH MORRIS TODAY FROM TEAM WORKS. I'M IN IN THE ONES THAT WE WORK WITH WE ACTUALLY RIGOROUSLY MEASURE THE IMPACT ON FAMILY INCOMES INDIVIDUAL WORKER OWNERS WERE DOUBLING AND TRIPLING THEIR PERSONAL INCOMES THEY WERE BECOMING PRIMARY BREAD WINNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT WAS INCREASING FAMILY INCOMES BY FORTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT. SO THAT WAS PROFOUND BENEFIT. FOR LOW INCOME LATINO WORKERS HERE IN THE BAY AREA. ALSO JUST JUST TOUCH ON THE NEXT ONE STABILITY FOR WORKERS IS ALSO PROFOUND IN THE GREAT RECESSION. IF THERE IS A NUMBER OF. IMPRESSIVE DATA POINTS NOW AND THIS IS ONE THAT THE LESS THAN 3% OF EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP EMPLOYEE OWNERS WERE LAID OFF AND IN TWENTY TEN. THIS IS 12% OF NON EMPLOYEE OWNERS. SO THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE COOPERATIVE BUSINESS MODEL AND FOR EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP. A DISTURBING HOME TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL YOU'LL HEAR FROM A PANEL LATER THAT THE MORE THIS. WANTED HIM TO ANOTHER COMPANY. IN IN SILICON VALLEY FLEET IN UNION CITY THAT THAT WE WORK WITH. CHECK THAT THE SURVEY GAS IS ONE OF THE ELECTRIC ARREST RECURRENT. ANGLE I'M WHO BECAME A CO OP. ME. RIGHT IN THE PICTURE. TOLD US SINCE THE- ADDED. TO HER. IN TOTAL ON THE LEFT AND SARA WERE THE ORIGINAL FOUNDING WORKER OWNERS THAT NOW EXPANDED THAT TO MORE. AND THEY'VE MANAGED TO SHARE PROFITS WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND THEN EACH YEAR THEREAFTER OF THEIR CONVERSION. AND THIS PAST YEAR THEY SHARED WITH US THAT THAT PROFIT SHARING FOR THE WORK ON THIS WAS A PREVALENT TO FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR OF PAY. SO DRAMATIC IMPACT AS THAT SHARING OWNERSHIP CAN HAVE ON WORKERS. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I THINK MANY OF THESE CONVERSIONS AS AS AND POINTED OUT. OUR GOAL OF THE ACT OF. KILLING THIS IS THE ONE BY USUALLY WHITE MEN. TELLING YOU BECAUSE OF COLOR OF ITS WORK FOR THAT IN THE LOT BECAUSE OF. THAT THE REPTILE WELL CAP THAT I KNOW WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT HIGH IT'S TIME FOR ME TO WRAP UP SO I'LL JUST MENTION THAT CONVERSIONS ARE HAPPENING AROUND THE STATE. IN ADDITION TO A SLICE OF NEW YORK IN NILES PIE WE JUST CAN BID ADAMS DIDN'T IT MOMENT. COMPANY BURKE. HELLO SOLAR ELECTRIC IN A ROOM PART OF THE- IT DOESN'T BURDEN. PRISON PLEA INTERESTED PREVENT PRIVATE IS OP AND JUST TO WRAP UP I'D LIKE TO MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ABOUT WHAT IS THE ECOSYSTEM STATEWIDE THAT COULD SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF HER C<U>&LT;C.CYAN&GT;&LT;/C&GT;</U> AROUND STATE AND THE ROCKETS CONSIST. OF THIS MARKET YEARS AGO AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WAS THE INCREMENTS. I'LL MAKE A MENTION IN THE HEALTH AND WE ARE NOT SEVENTY ONE WITH FOUR MILLION DOLLARS INITIAL CAPITAL THAT IS A BILLABLE TO FINANCED VERSION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN ARIZONA ARE PUBLIC LAUNCH OF ACCELERATING PLAY UNDER SHIP IS HAPPENING. NEXT WEEK AND LONG BEACH OR IT THREE WEEKS FROM NOW. I'M SO WE STILL NEED MORE FINANCING WE STILL NEED TO UNLOCK MAINSTREAM FINANCING. BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE COMPANIES THAT ARE CONVERTING NOW WHICH IS REALLY EXCITING. ON THE SENATE RICARDO HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED SOME GREAT IDEAS BUT THIS TICKET. WENT OFF AT THROUGH THE RIGHT HERE. VIEWS ALL FOR WORK TO BUY THIS IS AND THEY GO UP FOR SALE. AND HOW. IN WASHINGTON DC RECENT LAW SINCE THE PAST I'M IN. BUSINESS THIS HAS BEEN PROPOSED YOU CAN ACTUALLY. IN FRANCE SO THAT SOME INTEREST PRESS THERE. AN ORGANIZATION CALLED CONCERNED CAPITAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS SUCCESSFULLY USED WE OWE A FUNDS TO HAVE CITIES AND OTHER COUNTIES PROMOTE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP CONVERSIONS AND OF COURSE WE OWE A FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE STATE SO I THINK THIS PRESENTS A REAL OPPORTUNITY. I'M AND FINALLY WE DO HAVE A STATE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM THAT CAN BE USED TO GUARANTEE THESE TRANSITIONS AND IF THERE WERE WAYS TO MAKE THAT LESS EXPENSIVE. FOR EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP TRANSACTIONS. MARKS SELECT. AND I BELIEVE IT THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HILLARY AND NEXT UP MATURE HOT IF YOU MENTIONED. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I'M RICHARD HOBBS IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HUMAN AGENDA AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF HUMAN RELATIONS AND CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRANT PROGRAMS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THIS MORNING WHEN I WENT TO REFINE MY PRESENTATION I FOUND THAT BOTH MY LAW OFFICE AND HUMAN AGENDA HAD BEEN ROBBED. AND SO THEREFORE I LOST MY LAPTOP MY BRIEFCASE AND MY PRESENTATION. HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW THINGS THE VISION A FEW MINUTES CHEN AGENDA IS BASED ON AN IDENTIFICATION OF HUMAN NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFICATION OF HUMAN NEEDS FROM THAT HUMAN AGENDA HAS DEVELOPED A FIVE PART VISION. FIRST CARE WORK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE TIME AND RESOURCES TO PARTICIPATE IN SELF CARE AND CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY AND IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY SECOND THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OF. WAGES AT WITH FAIR WORKING CONDITIONS AND LIVING WAGE JOBS WITH REDUCED WORK HOURS THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL WITH REDUCED WORK HOURS MAKING SOMETHING OF VALUE FOR SOCIETY THIRD WE NEED OPPORTUNITY FOR LIFE LONG EDUCATION AND ACTUALLY CORRECT INFORMATION. FOR ALL OF US NEED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ALL OF THE ENTITIES THAT WERE PART OF FROM THE FAMILY ALL THE WAY TO THE UNITED NATIONS WE NEED PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND FINALLY AT THE TOP OF MASS LOVES HIERARCHY OF NEEDS IS THE TIME FOR SELF REALIZATION OF WHICH WE HAVE NO TIME AND SILICON VALLEY. BECAUSE WERE WALKING AROUND WORKING SUPER HOURS AND SUPER ALIENATED. FROM THAT. HUMAN AGENDA HEADS. ASKED THE QUESTION HOW DO WE COME TO THAT VISION AND WE DECIDED THAT WE CAN NEVER REALLY GET TO THAT VISION BASED ON OUR CURRENT INSTITUTIONS ARE CURRENT ECONOMIC. FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS WE CAN'T GET TO THAT KIND OF A SOCIETY WHERE ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS ARE BASED ON EXPLOITATION FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE BASED ON SPECULATION AND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS ARE BASED ON CORRUPTION FREQUENTLY. THE VALUES OF HUMAN AGENDA OUR DECKS DEMOCRACY EQUITY CO OPERATION KINDNESS AND SUSTAINABILITY. AS A FREQUENT SPEAKER AT CIVIC GROUPS I ASKED THE QUESTION IF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS PRIVATE BANKS AND OUR CURRENT POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS ARE DEMOCRATIC. EGALITARIAN COOPERATIVE KIND SUSTAINABLE AND PEOPLE WHEN THEY THINK OF LIKE MONTH CENTER WELL FARGO THEY PRETTY MUCH LAUGH. NO BASED ON DECKS VALUES WE NEED A NEW ECONOMY WE NEED A NEW FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND WE NEED POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT'S WHY HUMAN AGENDA IS SUPPORTING WORKER OWNED COOPERATIVES PUBLIC BANKS AND CORPORATE FREE PUBLICLY FINANCED ELECTIONS. WORKER OWNED COOPERATIVES ARE A KEY ECONOMIC INSTITUTION TO MAKE A TRANSITION TO A SOCIETY BASED ON DEMOCRACY EQUITY COOPERATION KINDNESS AND SUSTAINABILITY. THEY ARE MORE DEMOCRATIC WITH ONE WORKER ONE VOTE THEY ARE THE EPITOME OF. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT IS BASED ON PARTICIPATION. THEY ARE MUCH MORE EQUITABLE WITH DIFFERENCES IN THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST PAID BEING ONE TO TWO OR ONE TO FIVE FOR EXAMPLE IN THEM UNDERGONE COOPERATIVES IN SPAIN. WE KNOW THAT. PEOPLE WILL NOT OVER CONSUME AND YET THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH TO. HAVE A DECENT LIVING. THEY ARE MORE COOPERATIVE BY THEIR VERY NATURE THEY ARE MORE KIND ALSO BECAUSE COOPERATIVE MEMBERS THAT WORK TOGETHER MAKING DEMOCRATIC DECISIONS IN THEIR OWN WORKPLACE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO PROBLEM SOLVE AND RESOLVE THE CONFLICTS. AMICABLY. AND FINALLY THEY ARE MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE NOT ONLY BY OPTIMIZING INSTEAD OF MAXIMIZING CONSUMPTION. NOT ONLY BY REDUCING WORKING HOURS TO ADDRESS INDIAN NATION BUT ALSO BY MAKING ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS THAT DON'T IMPACT THE WORKPLACE OR THE COMMUNITY IN A NEGATIVE WAY. THE LEGAL COLLECTIVE OF HUMAN AGENDA THAT'S DOING DEPORTATION DEFENSE AT THIS TIME CLOUT ALL IS OPERATING INSIDE A NON PROFIT. AS A COOPERATIVE IMPLEMENTING OUR DECISION MAKING THROUGH THESE FIVE PRINCIPLES IN ADDITION HUMAN AGENDA HAS HELPED FOSTER THE CREATION OF THE SMART GUARDS COOPERATIVE AND IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO DEVELOP OTHER LOCAL COOPERATIVES IN SAN JOSE AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THESE INCLUDE UP PROMOTE OR UPS OR HEALTH EDUCATORS IN GILROY AND IN HOLLISTER. AS WELL AS THAI MASSAGE THERAPISTS MY OWN LAW OFFICE. AND A JANITORIAL BUSINESS THAT IS UNDER AN ICE AUDIT RIGHT NOW THAT NEEDS TO FORM A WORKER OWNED COOPERATIVE INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT. BUSINESS MODEL THAT THEY HAVE. IT WOULD BE WHO OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NO I WOULD SAY IT IS ACTUALLY IN COME BEEN ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CONSIDER THE THREE OPTIONS THAT HILLARY HAS MENTIONED AND IN PARTICULAR FIND WAYS TO PROMOTE THE CREATION OF WORKER OWNED COOPERATIVES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BOTH THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE- VERY DETAILED DESCRIPTION NOT ONLY OF WORKING COOPERATIVES BUT- ABOUT THE STATE CAN DO. TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF BROKEN COOPERATIVES I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ALONG WITH YOUR AGENDA THERE'S COME FOUR PAGER. THAT WAS DONE BY. LABOR COMMITTEE CHIEF CONSULTANT AND PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT MAKE ELAINE TO MY RIGHT AND JUST DO A CRUISE SO THAT'S IT DOES A REALLY GOOD I THINK SYNOPSIS. OF BROKEN COOPER'S AS A PERTAINS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK HEARING FROM. OUR FOUR PANELISTS WE GET A SENSE OF NOT ONLY THE VALUE OF THE CROP OF COOPERATIVES BUT WILL BE CAN DO. MOVING FORWARD I IN AND WE ALSO HAVE WITH US NOW ARE. I ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS WHO. CANCEL REPRESENTS NORTH TO ME ROBERT SOUTH OF ME SO SOUTH COUNTY YEARS ANTI COUNTIES WAS. AS WELL AS I SAN BENITO COUNTY WHERE HE SERVED ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS WE KNOW. A LOT OF THE COST PRESSURES ARE MAKING VERY DIFFICULT TO SURVIVE YEARS OF THE VALLEY HAD BEEN RAPIDLY EXPANDING INTO SOUTH COUNTY AND ASSEMBLY COUNTY. AS OF THESE ISSUES OF SUSTAINABILITY WORK ARE ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO SOME THOUGH BUT WE'RE FORMALLY MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE NOW BECOMING LITTLE MORE. URBANIZED AND SO. BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS ON. AND SO WHAT WHAT ONE QUESTION ONE ASKED LIKE A LEAD OFF. MISS ABOUT. IN TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT COULD CLOSE THE OWNERS RETIRED I'M ACTUALLY. REALLY FASCINATED ABOUT THE ABILITY TO KEEP THESE BUSINESSES FROM CLOSING BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IN FACT. ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS FAMILY HAS A RESTAURANT THAT THEIR UNCLE AND HIS OWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THAT IS CLOSING BECAUSE THE KIDS DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT OVER AND NOW A- A MORE CORPORATE OWNED A BUSINESS IS COMING IN ALL THE EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS ARE BEING. LET GO AND NOT RETAINED AND SO ESPECIALLY AND SOAK ABOUT I OFTENTIMES WILL DIG IN A BUSINESS CLOSES IT'S- SIMPLY BECAUSE RENT THAT INCREASE WHAT BUT OFTENTIMES ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES THAT COULD CONTINUE. AND SO. WHAT SPECIFICALLY. DOES PROJECT EQUITY DUE TO HELP IN THAT TRANSITION YEAH. YEAH WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE BELIEVE IS NEEDED. I'M AND THEN WE BRING IN LEGAL AND CPA SUPPORT TO SUPPLEMENT THAT THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE THAT WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF THE GENERALIST IN THE PROCESS WERE BUSINESS GENERALISTS. THE FIRST STEP IS USUALLY FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT AND THAT FOCUSES A LOT ON. FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY SPECIFICALLY THROUGH THE LENS OF DEBT CAPACITY. BECAUSE MOST WORKERS AS I THINK WE ALL WOULD ASSUME. ARE NOT SHOWING UP WITH A LARGE CHECK TO PAY THE. TING OWNER FOR THE BUSINESS AND IN FACT WE GENERALLY WITH WORKER COOPERATIVES THE WORKER OWNER BY AND THEIR INITIAL EQUITY INVESTMENT. CAN BE PAID THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTION OVER A YEAR OR MORE BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T SHOWING UP WITH A CAPITAL WE KNOW AMERICANS. PEOPLE IN THE U. S. DON'T HAVE SAVINGS SO GENERALLY SPEAKING. SO WE LOOK AT WHAT HOW MUCH DEBT COULD THE BUSINESS POTENTIALLY TAKE ON IF IT WERE TO BECOME A WORKER COOPERATIVE THAT CO OP WOULD BE ABLE TO POTENTIALLY GET A LOAN FROM A CD A FIRE FROM A LOAN FUND LIKE THE ONE WE'RE WHAT. WE'RE LAUNCHING OR OTHERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND THE SELLER WOULD FINANCE PART OF IT AND GET PAID OFF OVER TIME. I'M OFTEN WE'RE SEEING THE SELLER TAKE ON MAYBE 3250% AS A NOTE AND THEN THAT THE OUTSIDE FUNDERS TAKE ON 5270% AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH DEBT COULD THEY AFFORD TO TAKE ON AND STILL BE A HEALTHY BUSINESS AND STILL HAVE SOME PROFIT TO SHARE. IN PATRONAGE DIVIDENDS SO THAT'S A LOT OF OUR WORK IN THE FEASIBILITY STAGE IS TO ASSESS THAT AND THEN TO TALK WITH THE OWNER WHAT WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR WHAT DO THEY NEED WHAT DO THEY EXPECT IN TERMS OF PRICE AND HOW TO THOSE THINGS MATCH. AND WE ALSO LOOK AT MANAGEMENT CAPACITY IN THE COMPANY. AND THE OWNER OFTEN WITH SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN OWNED BY THE SAME PERSON FOR TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS. SOMETIMES THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED SORT OF A FULL FLEDGED MANAGEMENT TEAM OR DON'T HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS READY TO STEP IN AND TAKE OVER THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONS OF THAT OWNERS STILL. DOES DAY TODAY SO WE HELP THEM LOOK AT THAT QUESTION. AND THEN WE PROVIDE EMPLOYEE TRAINING AT THAT STAGE. I'M IF WHEN YOU FINISH THE FEASIBILITY IF THE BUSINESS OWNER WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD. AND IF THE BUSINESS OWNER WANTS TO BRING IN PLAYS INTO THE CONVERSATION AT THAT POINT WILL HELP WITH THAT. BUT THEN WHEN THEY FORMALLY BEFORE WE START WITH THE COLOR BUSINESS TRANSITIONS PROGRAM AND IT'S A TWELVE MONTH PROGRAM OR LESS. THAT'S VERY STRUCTURED. AND WALKING THROUGH THE TRANSITION UNTIL IT'S COMPLETE AND UNDER THE CONCEPT OF THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL WHAT. EXPECTATIONS ARE THERE ON THE WORKERS SIDE. TO BE IN A POSITION IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER. PRESS FUSIL ROCK SO YEAH WE WANT TO DO THIS. IS ARE SOME OF THE IT TYPICALLY IN THAT KIND OF. IT BACK ABOUT POLICY EXIST WHAT KIND OF. OBLIGATION IS THERE FOR TRAINING FOR WORKERS ONE THING TO BE EVEN LIKE A RESTAURANT MANAGER OR LINE WORKER. TO ACTUALLY RUN THE BUSINESSES. AND SO. IS TRAINING OF THAT NATURE. PART OF THE UNDERSTANDING. THAT RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL ON THE CONCERT. YEAH I BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE I HAVEN'T SEEN IN SPECIFIC POLICY PROPOSALS AROUND US AND WE WOULD LOVE TO TALK. TO ANYONE AND- I'M KIND OF. HOPING TO HELP YOU THAT. FUNDING FOR THE WORKERS TO PARTNER WITH AN ORGANIZATION LIKE OURS OR OTHERS THAT WOULD. BE ABLE TO HELP THEM I'M- EXECUTED TRANSITION RSS THE TRANSITION AND THEN ACCESS THE TRAINING AND SUPPORT THAT WOULD NEED. BECAUSE I AGREE THAT WOULD BE ESSENTIAL NHÀ. AND USUALLY THOSE LAWS HAVE A SHORT PERIOD DURING WHICH THE WORKERS IN THE- THE TENANTS ARE ABLE TO STEP UP. AND SO EVEN TO BE READY TO LIKE THEY MAY NOT HAVE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE THAT MOMENT SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO. BE A VERY RAPID RESPONSE YEAH. A GREAT I CAN AS AN IN PLACE. DID YOU IDEA SORT OF SOMEONE AS A BUSINESS AND THEY WANT TO. GET OUT THE ONE RETIRED I'VE YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO PUT OBSTACLES FOR THEM. TO BE TRANSITION. THERE NEXT PHASE LIFE AS WELL. AND IN A COUPLE OF YOU MENTIONED THE- STATE. OF THE OFFICE FOR EMPLOYEE. OWNERSHIP AND THAT. IT'S NOT CURRENTLY NOT STAFFED AND DOES NOT BUT. VERY WELL QUITE SIMPLY IF IT WERE STAFF WHAT WOULD YOU WANT THAT THOSE THAT THE STAFF MEMBERS TO DO. IT IN AND HELPING EXPAND ON EXPANDED SUPPORT WORKER COOPERATIVES. THANKS YES SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY COULD BE DOING ARE A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING THAT WE THEN CAN HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO TO WORK WITH CLIENTS WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO REALLY PUT THE TIME AND ENERGY INTO IMPLEMENTING CONVERSIONS TO HELPING START UPS. SO DOING A LOT OF THE PUBLIC AWARENESS EDUCATION ENGAGING WITH CITIES WITH UNIVERSITIES WITH LAW SCHOOLS HELLO A BIG BARRIER IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS MODEL IT EVEN EXISTS AND SO IF THERE WAS A STATE CENTER FOR EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP THEY COULD BE ENGAGING WITH. AT LAW SCHOOLS WITH BUSINESS SCHOOLS TO GET INTO THE CURRICULUM UNDERSTANDING AND EDUCATION AROUND DEMOCRATIC EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP AS SOMETHING FOR THEIR STUDENTS ACTUALLY LEARNING BE INTERESTED IN AND THEN MOVE OUT INTO THE WORLD AND BE SKILLED. SKILLED IN OTHER THINGS THAT THE STATE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP CENTER COULD DO IS LIKE HELLER WAS TALKING ABOUT HELPING TO IMPLEMENT THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNLOCK THE GROWTH OF COOPERATIVES. SO WORKING WITH THIS WITH THE STATE IF THERE WAS A LOAN PROGRAM WHERE IF A FUND THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL FOR EXAMPLE THAT PEOPLE COULD TAP INTO. SO STEWARDING THAT SETTING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT IT'S NOT ONLY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE STATE BUT ALSO ACCOUNTABLE TO. THE LABOR COMMUNITY IN GENERAL SO HOW IS THAT STRUCTURED ITSELF SO THEY COULD SUPPORT IN AND CREATING IN. STEWARDING IT AS WELL SO THERE'S JUST A FEW IDEAS. YEAH AND I THINK ONE MODEL TO LOOK AT IS THE RECENT REFUNDING ACTUALLY THE MAIN OF THE MASSACHUSETTS SIMPLY ENERGY CENTER SO I WAS STARTED TO BELIEVE IN THE LATE SEVENTIES EARLY EIGHTIES WAS FUN FOR AWHILE TO DO THAT TYPE OF WORK TO RICARDO SPEAKING ABOUT AND THEN YOU KNOW IS A IS A BUDGET LINE ITEM THAT WENT AWAY IN FACE OF OTHER PRIORITIES BUT BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY URGENT ISSUE WHILE IN STATES ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY. MASSACHUSETTS REFUNDED THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE THAT ASSISTANCE SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A RESTORED THE CONFLICT. THAT AND POTENTIALLY REPLICATED HERE IN THE STATE. I WOULD ALSO. ADD THAT WORKING WITH THE LOCAL LABOR COUNCIL. THERE ARE MODELS OF A UNION COOP THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. EXAMPLE IN CINCINNATI WHERE STEEL WORKERS IN THE RETAIL CLERKS. HAVE ACTUALLY BOUGHT BUSINESSES. AND ARE CONTINUING AS UNION MEMBERS BUT ALSO WORKER OWNERS. AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING WORKING WITH THE LOCAL ORGANIZED LABOR THEY CAN IDENTIFY WHEN A BUSINESS CLOSES. AND THEY CAN MOVE IN WITH THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. THEY CAN HAVE A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY. TO KEEP JOBS LOCAL IN THE COMMUNITY. AND NOT DISRUPT THE FAMILIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD LOSE THEIR POSITIONS. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE THAT HAS ANY QUESTION WE HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES. A FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT OR QUESTION ON THIS PANEL. I WANTED TO START A BLOG WE'LL GIVE YOU CAN GO FOR IT IS NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE WE WILL JOBS LIKE IF YOU GO TO SCHOOL. THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT SIGN THANK YOU IF YOU GO TO SCHOOL OR THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT ALL YOU GET FINANCE FROM A VENTURE CAPITALIST AND ALL THAT I DON'T SEE A LAW THE WORKSHOP. WILL MEET UP OR INFORMATION OF ALL COOPER. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO START. AND GET INTO IT BUT- THERE'S NOT THAT MANY INFORMATION ON IT SO I'M JUST WANTING. HOW ARE YOU GUYS GONNA PULL MORE THESE KIND OF LIKE MODELS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IS SOUNDS ABOUT WAS WHAT WILL CARTER WAS TOUCHING UPON IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT THAT'S OF THE STATE. CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF BECAUSE I DON'T THE STATE'S DOING ANY OF THAT RIGHT NOW. IS TO REALLY HELP EDUCATE BUT THE COMMUNITY EDUCATE BUSINESS SCHOOLS LAW SCHOOLS. ON ON THE ON THE DIFFERENT MODELS THAT EXIST IN TERMS A WORKER COOPERATIVES. BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE. THAT THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANYTHING LEASE PUBLICLY. THAT AS PUT OUT I KNOW CERTAINLY CERTAIN CITIES OR OR COUNTIES MAY BE DOING SOME WORK BUT- IS THERE ANYTHING YOU LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. IN ADDITION TO THE- THE- PREMISE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO MORE ON OUTREACH EDUCATION IS. OR ANYTHING RIGHT NOW WHERE SOMEONE'S INTERESTED THEY CAN GO TO. I COULD HAVE A THOUGHT. OF MITCH MILLER WHO IS THE STAFF PERSON CURRENTLY UNFUNDED OF THE CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP SHARE SOME THOUGHTS WITH ME ON THIS AND- ONE OF THEIR GOALS IS TO EDUCATE. BUSINESS SERVICE PROVIDERS SO WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW PROFESSIONAL. ADVISERS CPA'S LAWYERS. EXIT PLANNERS THOSE TYPES OF FOLKS. I'M OR SPD SEES THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS SO THE GENTLEMAN MENTIONED SCORE. SO IT WOULD REALLY BE A SUCCESS IF THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THREE YEARS FROM NOW. ANYONE LIKE YOU SIR WHO WENT IN TO TALK TO A SCORE ADVISER WOULD AT LEAST HERE THAT YES YES A WORKER COOPERATIVE IS SOMETHING YOU COULD DO I CAN REFER YOU HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION. I'M AND WITH THE MAINSTREAM EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP SB DC'S. HAVE A MANDATE ACTUALLY IT ISN'T UNFUNDED MANDATES SO ADVOCATES LIKE US NEED TO REALLY BE WORKING SO THAT SB DC'S KNOW THEY- CAN BE DOING THIS THEY SHOULD BE DOING THIS AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO AT LEAST BE CONVERSANT. AND MAKE GOOD REFERRALS AROUND THIS BUSINESS MODELS. THANK YOU SO IT YES. YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH START UP SORRY I'M INTERESTED IN START UP OPPORTUNITIES I REALIZED YOU KNOW A LOT OF ATTENTION AS BEEN ON CONVERSIONS WHICH I THINK IS REALLY VALUABLE AND GREAT BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE HELP IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE CO OPS AND WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN AT THE START UP LEVEL ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANTS IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS. CAN YOU COMMENT ON ANY OF THAT. YEAH. YES SO THERE'S ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THIS THE SAME LOOK ON HIS LAWCENTER PROJECT EQUITY WHO ARE DOING WORK WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORKER COOPERATIVE BUSINESSES AND THERE ARE SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK WITH IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES TO HELP THEM START WORKER COOPERATIVES THERE'S THE TEAM WORKS INSTITUTE DOWN HERE AND THE SOUTH BAY THERE'S HUMAN AGENDA THERE'S- A IN THE EAST BAY THERE'S ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SOME US MAYFAIR WHO ARE WORKING WITH IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES HERE IN THE SOUTH BAY TO EMPOWER THEM TO GIVE THEM THE INFORMATION AND THEN THEY PULL US AND TO PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING. ONE RESOURCE THAT I CAN JUST MENTION RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIES LAWCENTER DOES FREE LEGAL ADVICE FOR NONPROFITS WORKER COOPERATIVE SOCIAL ENTERPRISES THREE TIMES PER MONTH AND AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE TIMES IS VIRTUAL SO PEOPLE CAN CALL IN AND WE CAN HAVE A VIRTUAL CONVERSATION TO TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL NEEDS OF MAKES DOCUMENTATION. STATUS MEMBER OWNED COOPERATIVES. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE QUESTION AND THE RESPONSE EGGMAN INTEREST THE TIME THAT WE WILL TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PANEL BUT WANT TO THANK. OUR PANELISTS FOR GIVING IS A REALLY GOOD FOUNDATION. ON WORKERS COOPERATIVES AS WELL AS WHAT THE STATE CAN DO A LOT MORE OF. THANK YOU. SO UP NEXT WE- HAVE A PANEL TO REPRESENT WERE COOPERATIVES IN CALIFORNIA AND A NUMBER OF LOCAL CLUB AS WELL. IN OUR PART OF OUR PANELISTS ARE AND THEY CAN DO OF FURTHER INTRODUCTION THEMSELVES BEEN INTERESTED TIME I'LL JUST. NAME THEM AND WHO THEY REPRESENT. KIRK BARTON FROM A SLICE OF NEW YORK PIZZA. SOUP AS SU LOPEZ FROM. OUR IS MANDY. ASSOCIATION OF COOPERATIVES. ELIZABETH SARMENTO FROM SMART YARDS. AND ROCK CHRIS IT'S YELLOW FROM. NURSES CAN COOPERATIVE S. YEAH YOU YOU H. W. AND SO KIRK WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU CAN KICK IT OFF. IT'LL BE THE SAME A SIMILAR FORMAT BUT SEVEN MINUTES UP TO SEVEN MINUTES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL AND THEN A BEACON OF COMMENTS ON IN THE MEMBERS UP HERE AS WELL AS FROM. THE PUBLIC. GOOD AFTERNOON OR MORNING STARK MORNING USED TO GETTING UP IN THE AFTERNOON. I SAW MY NAME'S CURVE ARE TEN I MOVED OUT HERE FROM NEW YORK CITY AND NINETY EIGHT TO WORK AT HIGH TECH CISCO LIKE A LOT OF TRANSPLANTS DO. WHEN THINGS I MISSED GREATLY WAS PIZZA AS A AS A NEW YORKER AND WHEN I LOVE CISCO IN TWO THOUSAND SIX MY WIFE AND I WE OPENED UP A SLICE OF NEW YORK OVER ON STEVENS CREEK AND SAID. I WILL. ONE OF THE THING REALLY IN BRITAIN FOR UP AT THE CORE I WAS I WAS AT. B. C. B. BEFORE AND THIS GIRL HAD STOCKING YOU KNOW LIKE. YOU THAT MUCH STOCK YOU HAD THAT MUCH OWNERSHIP OF THE BUSINESS YOU STILL FELT LIKE YOU HAD THIS IS OUR COMPANY AND WE HAD PRIDE. IN IN OUR IN OUR BUSINESS WE ALWAYS WANT TO DO THAT IN OUR- IN OUR ORGANIZATION WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO INITIALLY. IN THE FORM OF STOCK BECAUSE OF TOO MANY. WE DIDN'T KNOW THE INDUSTRY AT ALL WE I NEVER BEEN IN RESTAURANTS AND URBAN FOOD SERVICE AND I'VE NEVER OPEN UP A BUSINESS LIKE THIS SO. OUR ATTORNEY BASICALLY SAID I DON'T TRYING TO ANY OF THAT YOU'RE ALL LIABILITIES AND YOU'RE GONNA SET EXPECTATIONS OR WHATEVER. BUT EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP IS ALWAYS SOMETHING WE WANTED TO DO AND THEN. HOW WE ACTUALLY TASKS SOME OF OUR TEAM TO ACTUALLY DO A- BUSINESS INCUBATOR BUT YOU KNOW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. AND WE FOUND A WORKER COOPERATIVES SO I'M JUST GONNA TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT. WE FELT THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL FROM A TRANSITION PERSPECTIVE SO THAT I. INSIDE THE FIRST ONE IS. LONG TERM OF THE INDIVIDUALS TIME BUYS IT IS LONG THIS IS A STEPPING STONE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE OR WHAT WHAT'S MY NEXT THING I CAN NOW FOCUS ON A LONGER TERM HORIZON FOR THE EMPLOYEES WITH THEM. I HAVING MORE ENGAGED PEOPLE IN THE ORGANIZATION WE HAVE COMMITTEE IS WE HAVE BOARD. FEDERAL IT BY THE NUMBERS. THESE ARE SKI BUT YOU CAN BE ON THE BEACH YOU KNOW OUR BUSINESS SELF. CHART TOWN YOU KNOW THE FIGHT IS LOOK IT WITH THE GOOD. THE ACTION IS IN STRUCTURE OF HOW THEY HATE ENTER WHAT THE STATE PACKAGE IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND I MAY I THINK I JUST WANT WARM IT'S JUST THAT WE STARTED ABOUT THIS TOWER HOW DO YOU ALLOCATE RESOURCES IF YOU'RE GONNA GET A PAY INCREASE HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY FUND THAT AND TO GET PEOPLE THINKING DIFFERENTLY ON HOW THEY APPROACH. THE BUSINESS AND THE STRATEGY AROUND THAT. LOOKING AT HOW THE COMPANY'S GOING TO GROW AND WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS AGAIN WE HAVE THE BOARD IS INFORMED BY THE MEMBERS BUT THE BOARD IS REPRESENTED BY THE MEMBER ARAB REPRESENTS THE MEMBERS ARE AT THE ELECTED BY THE MEMBERS. SO THEY ARE THE WORKERS THEY IT'S NOT LIKE SOMEONE'S BROUGHT IN IN SOME KINDA. OUTSIDE ORGANIZATION IS LOOKING AT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COMPANIES THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COMPANY AND THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING INFORMED BY THE DATA THE ACTUAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION. I SAW THIS THIS MORE AS A POTENTIAL. A CAREER PATH NOW THIS IS BEFORE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SAW AS IT'S JUST A I WORK IN A PIZZA SHOP AND YOU KNOW I'LL DO WHATEVER INTO MY HOOD. DOVE DO MY NEXT THING. BUT NOW ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO CREATE A MECHANISM TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THIS AS A LONG TERM THING OUT I DID HAVE ONE LAST THING. THEY THEY THEY SUPPORTED ME AS THE GENERAL MANAGER OF PRIOR OWNER WHICH IS. ALSO VERY REWARDING. SO FOR OPPORTUNITIES THINGS THAT TO THINK ABOUT LIKE TRANSITION PROVIDES. I THINK IT. CAN THE BILL. BENCH STRENGTH. LEADERSHIP TEAM. AND ALLOWS. TO COME IN. OUR TEAM. ON HOW. HOW DO YOU. YOUR TEAM TO THE NEXT. WHAT IS. NEEDED YOUTUBE. HAIR THAT NEXT LEVEL. I AM. NOT TO BE AROUND. ARE THEY DON'T WANT. TO DRIVE ACTUALLY IT. I CAN HIRE OR FIRE BY THE BOARD SO I LOSE MY JOB IF I START **** UP. AND SO PUTS ME IN A LITTLE BIT MORE ACCOUNTABILITY ROLE THAN WHEN I WAS JUST AN OWNER BECAUSE AS AN OWNER INDIVIDUAL OWNER YOU KNOW. MY WAY THE HIGHWAY SEE LATER THANKS VERY MUCH BUT NOW I'M ACTUALLY I HAVE A COMMITMENT TO OUR TEAM AND OUR MEMBERS IT WAS YOU I ALWAYS DID I DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S HOW I WAS BEFORE BUT- IT TAKES THAT. THAT CHOICE OUT OF THE MIX I GUESS IT MAKES A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT. WE WERE VERY EMPOWERED WORKFORCE WE ALWAYS HAD AN POWER WORKFORCE BUT IS ACTUALLY GIVES THEM THE CHOPS TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING AND RUN WITH THAT. AND CREATING A- A LEGACY FOR NOT JUST THE BUSINESS BUT ALSO FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THERE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE WE SPOKE ABOUT. THE LAST PANEL IS NEED FOR EDUCATION AND NOT JUST THE EDUCATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE THERE BY THE CASE IN THE DISTRICT. ANY VÀ BRING PEOPLE AND SINGLE YES THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGED. SO I TIMES TIMES TIGHT SO I'M GONNA JUMP RIGHT TO MY FINAL SITE IS HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE HELP LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ASKED WE CAN MAKE OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE FIRST IS BROWN THE PROPOSAL GET IT. FOR THOSE OF YOU IN IN IN IN BUSINESS OR PERSONAL LIFE PERSONAL GUARANTEE. THIS IS ARE YOU HAVE WILL THROW TO. ACCEPT THE. I AND AS IF ANY CAN TELL US IF YOU HAVE A LOOK. THE LANDLORD WANTS TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THEIR RAN. OVER TO LEAST. THEY NEED A SINGLE PERSON THAT THE VIEW OF CHASER CITY MA'AM. CARE ABOUT HOW TO FOR HER OWNERSHIP THEN SHARED EQUITY THEY WANT A PERSON THAT IS LIKE IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING AND I'M GONNA GET YOU. AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO RESOLVE THAT AND DO SOMETHING WHETHER IT'S SOME KIND OF GENERAL'S FUNDED WITH SB A WHO WHOEVER BUT THAT IS A REAL ISSUE BECAUSE IT PUTS INDIVIDUALS. CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AT A AT MORE RISK WHICH IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF HAVING A COOP IS TO IS TO HAVE. EQUITY IN RISK. AND THE LAST THING I'LL SAY. IS AROUND SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH AND THIS IS. TALKED BRIEFLY. AT AT THE LAST. PAGE AND I. CAN ONGOING ABOUT REACH BUT I ASK YOU. A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IN. THE A PATIENT ON BUSINESSES. LIKE OUR SMALL SAYS THAT HAVE. OLDER ONLY. STEP THE OLDER SHOOT NOW HOW OLD OWNERS. LOOKING TO ACTUALLY MOVE ON OUTLOOK DO THEY ARE NOW BUT I MEAN YEARS POST OTHERS THAT ARE. BUT ALSO. HOW CAN REYES INNOCENT. GET EDUCATION AT AT. LIKE WHY ARE KIDS BEING TAUGHT ABOUT THIS IN SCHOOL LIKE HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE DYNAMIC AND REALLY IN BAD THIS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SO WE'RE NOT LEARNING ABOUT THIS AS ADULTS WE SHOULDN'T BE JUST LEARNING ABOUT YEAH ONE LEARN ABOUT WORKER COOPS BECAUSE- YOU MY FRIEND JUST TOLD ME IT'S LIKE WE SHOULD BE IN THE SHOULD BE PART OF OUR CURRICULUM. AND HOW YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT I DON'T HAVE THE KIDS BUT- HOW CAN WE GET THIS AT THE AT THE GRADE SCHOOL LEVEL AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND AT THE- AT THE- COLLEGE LEVEL THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL SO I WOULD ASK THAT. IS THERE ANY WAY TO INFLUENCE THOSE DECISIONS. AT THE AT THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM ON TO DO THAT. AND I WILL I WILL LEAVE I'LL LEAVE MY AND- BY A BY SEVEN MINUTES. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANKS KIRK AND THEN. TO ELIZABETH YOU CAN NOT SURE WHICH ONE WHAT WHAT ARE THE CALL POPULAR MODEL YOU CAN DECIDE WE WANT TO GO TO EXPECT A. TO DECIDE AMOUNTS JUST A HOAX. WHICH WOULD WHICH WOULD WHICH TWENTY YEARS HERE. THIS IS THE. THERE'S NINETY THIS IS THE WORST THING. THIS RIGHT THANK THREE VARIATIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY I'M SU LOPEZ I'VE GOT ONE BIG PHOTO SHARE WITH YOU AT LEAST MOMENTARILY. I'M GONNA LET. DEAL WITH THAT SO I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ARIZMENDI ASSOCIATION OF COOPERATIVE MAY TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THAT BACKGROUND ABOUT THE NETWORK OF COOPERATIVES THAT WE ARE AND THEN MY PERSONAL STORY OF BEING PART OF THIS COOPERATIVE ONE OF THE BAKERIES THERE IS MANY ASSOCIATION COOPERATIVES WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX NINETY FIVE NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN A COOPERATIVE STUDY GROUP CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME. AND THROUGH THE GOOD GRACES AND. MAXIMUM A GENEROSITY OF THE CHEESE BOARD WHICH IS A COLLECTIVE OF A FIFTY ONE YEAR OLD COLLECTIVE. BAKERY PIZZERIA IN BERKELEY THEY HELPED US START WITH THEM ACTUALLY ANOTHER BUSINESS YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE ACT WE COULDN'T FIND FUNDING. THEIR BANK OR WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING THROUGH BANK BUT MOSTLY THROUGH THE- CHEESE BOARD THEY HELPED US TRAIN AT THE HELP THIS LOAN US MONEY AND THEY HELP TO START A WHOLE ASSOCIATION. CALLED EHRESMANN THE ASSOCIATION OF COOPERATIVES SO WE WITH THE HELP OF THE CHEESE BOARD WE HAVE JUMP STARTED TO HAVE. SIX OTHER BAKERIES. THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM. THAT'S OKAY. WE HAVE SIX ERRORS MANDY'S FIGHTERS MONIES A ONE SHE'S BORED OR IN THE BAY AREA AND WE HAVE. RECENTLY HAS STARTED TO DIVERSIFY JUST WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE OF COOPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE TO SEARCH STARTED TO DIVERSIFY INTO DOING COOPER CONSTRUCTION COOPERATIVE. AND ROUTE LINE WHICH IS LOOKING IS GETTING COOPERATIVE WERE ALSO DEALING WITH A AT BUT KEEPING QUAN COOPERATIVE. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE A DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT COOPERATIVE AND THAT DEVELOPMENTS FOR COOPERATIVE HELP SUPPORT. THE DEVELOPMENT AND OF THE. FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THESE COOPER AS WE HELP BUILD COOPERATIVE AND DO JOB CREATION SO WITH IN THESE BUSINESSES WE HAVE NINE CO OPS EIGHT BUSINESSES. TWENTY THREE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS AS A NETWORK INCLUDING THE CHEESE BOARD WHICH IS FIFTY ONE YEARS OLD AND THE FIRST ARIZMENDI BAKERY WAS STARTED IN OAKLAND LAKE SHORE BAKERY. AND THEY ARE TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD RIGHT NOW THERE ARE A GROUP OF I THINK ABOUT THIRTY FIVE ACRES I'M PART OF THIS SECOND ARIZMENDI BAKERY AND SAN FRANCISCO AND BY GOLDEN GATE PARK. AND I'M ONE OF THE FOUNDERS THERE SO THIS STORY I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU GUYS TO KNOW IS JUST. LIKE EVERYBODY YOU'VE HEARD THIS MORNING THE IDEA. TO NORMAL THE I. OF WHAT. BEING A NORMAL THING. IN THE WORLD IN THE UNITED STATES THE KIND OF. INTERESTING I TELL YOU. ABOUT MY OPERATIVE MAKES IS WITH COOPER I WASN'T BEING BAKER HOW MUCH. THERE WAS A COOPERATIVE THAT WAS OPENING IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU DIDN'T NEED EXPERIENCE THEY WERE WILLING TO TRAIN YOU SO I DECIDED TO APPLY FOR A JOB NOW NINETEEN YEARS LATER OUR BAKERIES TURNING NINETEEN IN OCTOBER WE HAVE TWENTY TWO PEOPLE HALF OF THAT GROUP HAS BEEN THERE FOR. NINETEEN YEARS SO WITHIN THE FOOD INDUSTRY THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF REMARKABLE KIND OF STATISTIC THAT NORMALLY ESPECIALLY IN A BAKERY YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HOLD ON TO WORKERS THAT LONG SO WE'RE ABLE TO DO. TO HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE INVESTED IN THE BUSINESS. IN A COMPETITIVE WAY WE'RE NOT A NONPROFIT WERE REGULAR BAKERY AND YOUR INVEST IN THE BUSINESS ENOUGH THAT IT GROWS THE BUSINESS TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THOSE PEOPLE THEY'RE LIKE WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THIS IS PART OF YOUR BUSINESS SO WE'VE GOT TWENTY TWO PEOPLE I GUESS ABOUT TEN OF US HAVE BEEN THERE FOR ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS WE SUPPORT FIFTEEN CHILDREN. WE HAVE SEVEN OR EIGHT HOMEOWNERS ALSO WITHIN THE BAY AREA THAT'S REMARKABLE SERVICES TO HAVE SEVENTY EIGHT HOMEOWNERS WITH IN A SMALL BUSINESS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE BAY AREA THAT'S A VERY MARKEL CYSTIC. AND AS WELL AS IT IS. SORRY BUT THAT AS WELL AS THE CHILDREN AND THE HOMEOWNERSHIP WE TRY TO CREATE A BUSINESS THAT IS COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET PLACE AND I THINK THAT IS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A COOPERATIVE COULD IN A COOPERATIVE YOUR INVEST IN THAT BUSINESS AND YOUR- YOU WANT THAT TO SURVIVE AND IF IT'S GOING TO SURVIVE THEM IS GOING TO DO WELL YOU'RE GONNA PAY YOURSELF WELL WE- WE- TREAT OURSELVES WELL. SO WE ACTUALLY AS PART OF OUR AND SOMEBODY MENTIONED THAT FORTY HOURS A WEEK IS KIND OF NORM AND SILICON VALLEY IS PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT OURS IS A LITTLE BIT LESS WE DO. THREE TO FOUR SHIFTS A WEEK WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY SIX TO SEVEN WEEKS VACATION WE TREAT OURSELVES WELL AS I'M SAYING WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE COOP BECAUSE THEN YOU KEEP PEOPLE IN THE COOP AND USE CONTINUE TO BILL THAT CAUGHT OUR COOPS THE FAMILY COUGHS PAY FEES INTO A POT TO HELP DEVELOP OTHER COOPERATIVES. AND. THAT'S WHAT WE DO AS PART OF A NETWORK. IF THERE WAS OTHER FINDING I MEAN WITH IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF THIS. FAMILY OF COOPERATIVES BUT- YOU CAN IMAGINE IF THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A GRAND SCALE OF SUPPORT. OF THE AMOUNT OF CAPACITY THAT WE COULD REACH FOR AS WELL WOULD BE THAT MUCH MORE. AND ALSO I WANTED TO MENTION AS FAR AS NORMALIZING THE IDEA OF COOPERATIVES AND KIND OF GETTING AWAY OF THAT STERRY TO GET AWAY FROM THE STEREOTYPE OF SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF LIKE A HIPPY DIPPY THING. I WANT TO KIND OF MAKE THE POINT THAT LIKE YOU KNOW THE CLOCKS IT'S NOT THE ROSE COLORED GLASSES AS FAR AS LIKE EVERYTHING'S OKEY DOKEY WITH COPS AND WE ALL. LOVE EACH OTHER AND LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE AND DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER COULD MEALS TOGETHER. IT'S A NORMAL BUSINESS WE HAVE. INTENSE DISCUSSIONS OF THAT LEAD TO INTENSE ARGUMENTS THAT LEAD TO VERY LONG MEDIANS BUT IT'S ONE PERSON ONE VOTE. WHEN I FIRST YOU KNOW WAS TALKING TO AT KIRK ABOUT. YOU KNOW I WAS REACHING OUT TO FOLKS WERE LIKE WHY IS THIS LET NOT A NORMAL THING. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR KID. YOU'RE EXCITED TO GET THE CHANCE TO VOTE YOU TURN EIGHTEEN YOU GET TO VOTE THEN YOU BECOME AND EMPLOYEES SOMEPLACE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE A SAY. AND WHAT COMES TO WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS THAT. CO OPS EVEN IF IT'S A DYSFUNCTIONAL COP IT'S A COOP AND YOU HAVE A SAY. IN THAT AND YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A VOICE TO TRY TO. COOPER OVER. KIND OF JOB BECAUSE AT LEAST HAVE A VOICE AND YOU HAVE SOME AGENCY TO TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING. I THINK THAT IS WHAT'S MORE NORMAL ABOUT COOPS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WERE PEOPLE SAY ALL OF THIS CALL THE BACKUP IS LIKE WHATEVER WHATEVER. IT THAT IT'S JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF LIFE IT'S THIS BUSINESS OF THAT BUSINESS IT'S COOPS COULD BE GREAT COPS ARE NOT GREAT COPS BUT IT'S A COOP AND YOU HAVE AGENCY TO CREATE. THAT WITH YOUR VOICE IN WITH YOUR VOTE AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I FEEL. COULD BE SHARED AND FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A CO OP AND YOUR STEWARDING AN ORGANIZATION THAT IT'S NOT I MEAN YOU'RE DOING WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING MORE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR DOING WELL FOR YOUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE THAT BUSINESS THRIVE. AND YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING FORWARD FOR THAT BUSINESS TO MOVE FORWARD. BEYOND YOUR. WITHOUT BEYOND YOUR TIME THERE SO WE TRY TO KIND OF SEE THAT AS KIND OF A LEGACY THING WITH AND OUR NETWORKING WITHIN OUR ASSOCIATION AND OUR COOPERATIVES IT THEMSELVES. AND I HOPE THAT IDEA. THE KIND OF GET AWAY FROM LIKE I SAID LIKE SAID. TO KIND OF GET AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF COOPS KIND OF BEING UNDER ASSAULT BUT IT JUST IT'S NORMAL IT'S YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATION TO COMPROMISE THE COMMUNICATION. AS LONG AS EVERYBODY HAS A VOTE I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND WE KNOW THE ONE PERSON ONE VOTE. IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION RIGHT NOW FOR WAS ONE PERSON ONE VOTE. THE POPULAR VOTE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. SO.

LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US A SON NOR NOT ONLY A FAR COOPERATIVES BECAUSE OF OUR CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. I'M A CHANGED SINCE OUR INCEPTION AND TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAVE ON THE SIGN ANY INSTALLED ON HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE GARDENS A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF GRASS HAS BEEN REMOVED. THE GREAT FATHER LANDED TO LET. US SYSTEM. FOUR POINT I MILLION GALLONS PER YEAR THINK ABOUT THAT A LOAN AND IS THE ARE DRAW AND MATURE. AND ALL OVER AND OUR STATE. YOU HAVE TO OCT THE ADDRESS TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES FOR ALL OF WORLD. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FAMILIES IN THE EARTH AND STUDENT OF BEING ENGAGE AND OUR WORK. THAT WAS VERY EXCITING AND DOT HERE IS ONE OF THE GRAY WATER SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE DOING THE INSTALLATION WITH ONE OF OUR MEMBERS AND THROUGH IT ALL I'M GONNA TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR DO IT ON THE NEXT SLIDE. BUT THERE'S IT BASICALLY THESE OF FRUIT TREES ARE GOING TO BE WATER FIVE FRUIT TREES BY A GRAY WATER SYSTEM GRAY WATER SYSTEM SO IT'S A REALLY GREAT WAY TO GO A LAUNDRY TO LANDSCAPE TO BE ABLE TO RE USE THAT WATER. AND TO GROW A LOT OF FOOD AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE WE ARE QUALIFIED ON CERTIFIED. GRAY WATER INSTALLERS FROM THE GRAY WATER ACTION. AND WE GO THROUGH ALL THE- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE CARE PLAN THEY CARE AND FAIR SHARE WHEN IT COMES TO. DO THE TO DO TO THIS WORK. SO I THOUGHT ON ONE OF OUR MEMBERS OF LET THE VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION OF HONDURAS AFTER THE CREW THAT TODD BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE.

ABOUT ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR PLANET. SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE. WE'D TO WASTE INSTEAD. A MATERIAL TO BOND BILLS THAT YOU. IS THE LITTLE BOX YOU'RE WITH T. TOP LIKE THAT. WE ARE. ABLE TO MAKE IT FOR US CENTER PIECES FOR EVENTS WEDDINGS AND WHAT NOT. FROM FENCES THAT WE REMOVE A REDWOOD. AND SO FRIENDS THIS GOAL IS LOOKING AT THESE LANDSCAPE THERE YOU SEE THE BEFORE. BEEF BUT THEY'RE USED. THE. INNER AND RIGHT BEHIND IT BUNCH OF BREAK. IT'S YOU OUGHT TO. BOB TO THE LOOK AND FEEL. NO HE'S AND WE SHAUN OFFER THIS TYPE OF. THERE ARE MORE BY GOING IN MORE SUCH A ROCK THE SIZE OF THE UNIT AND THAT THE BENEFITS OF BEING. AN ENERGY AND UNIT WE HAVE THESE BENEFITS. THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF THE GRAY WATER SYSTEM LAUNDRY TO LANDSCAPE YOU CAN SEE THE PLUMBING THESE OF THEM A THREE BOB GOOD TO THE FRUIT TREES. AND TALL. THIS IS VERY EXCITING WORK I WE CAN REMAIN MANY MORE CALL UPS. OR FOR OTHER PAPERS TO UP TO DO THIS WHAT AND THE GROWING AMOUNT BECAUSE OF ALL THE SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHARLIE LUNGES REQUIRED AND ECOLOGICAL LANDSCAPING APPROACH AND WE BUILD COMMUNITY AND TRAIN WORKERS. AND ENGAGING NEIGHBORS. AND FAMILIES WE INTRODUCE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLAN. OF FLORA AND PHONE NOT TO THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE AN APPRECIATION. LIKE VERY VERY UP SHOULD TIP OF YOUR SUPPORT AND ALL OF YEAH FOR DOING BEFORE. THANK YOU ELISABETH AND OUR- FINAL PANELIST IS ROCK CITY YELLOW WITH NURSES CAN COOPERATIVE. OKAY STARTED ALL DAY FIND IT MY NAME THREE CHRIS ITALO I WORK IN RESEARCH AT SEIU UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS WERE A LABOR UNION OF ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOSPITAL WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERSHIP IS ALLIED HEALTH CARE WORKERS SO FOLKS IN JOBS LAKE LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSING EVEY S. R. JANET WORK DIETARY WORK. PEOPLE AND ALSO. CAN PROVIDE CLASSIFICATION IN HOSPITALS. INCLUDED TODAY AND THAT THAT HAPPENED THANK YOU. I WANTED TO YOU TIMES CHANGE THINGS SAYS THE PERSON YOU'RE FROM FROM ORGANIZED LABOR I WANTED TO SHARE WHAT I SEE AS THE NATURAL ALIGNMENT BETWEEN. YOU KNOW DEVELOPING WORKER COOPS AND ALSO ORGANIZED LABOR. AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU OUR EXPERIENCE AT U. H. W. WORKING WITH A GROUP OF LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES WHO CREATED AND INCORPORATED A WORKER COOP AND THEN UNIONIZED WITH OUR UNION. SO THE SO THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OR I GUESS BY YOU PROPOSITION KIND WORK COOPER AND FAMILY UNIONS. IN MY VIEW. LAUGHING. THAT WAS FIRST LIGHT AND HAD THE SEVEN COOPER SUPPORT BILLS THINGS LIKE DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CONTROL ALL NUMBER. INCOME INTO EDUCATION TRAINING ARE ALL THINGS THAT. WITH FIRST EMPOWER WORKERS AND TO BUILD STABLE AND DURING A CONNIE'S BUT ASIDE FROM THE VALUES ALIGNMENT UNIONS AND CAUGHT SHARE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER COMMITMENTS THAT I'VE THAT I'VE LISTED HERE SO THINGS LIKE ACCESS TO MEANINGFUL BENEFITS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT GIVE PEOPLE. ACCESS TO COPE CAREER MOBILITY. SO I THINK ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE GROWING ECONOMY AND THAT KIND OF CONSTANT RESTRUCTURING OF WORK. LEAVE BECAUSE OF A MISSION AND OTHER AN ALMOND SAYS. AND THIS THINK THIS. MISSION OF THIS EXPECT AN OF ON DEMAND WORK IS ALSO. YOUR EARLY TROUBLING. I GUESS THAT YOU CAN CALL I'M SURE PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT RECENTLY. GET WORKFORCE MODELS THAT SHARE EQUITY GAINS ACROSS THE WORK FORCE. TO KIND OF FIGHT THAT TIED OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE'S LABOR. AND SO WE SAW THAT WE SAW WITH THE LVM WORKER COOPS WHICH I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IN A MINUTE THAT THERE'S ALSO REALLY SERIOUS STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES OF MARRYING ARE PARTNERING UNIONS THEN COLLAPSED TO GIVE PEOPLE. ACCESS TO BENEFITS AND PORTABILITY OF BENEFITS. AND YOU KNOW BUT ALSO REAL WORK PRETTY PLACE PROTECTIONS. THAT ARE BEING A ROAD IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS ELSEWHERE IN THE ECONOMY. SO I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE KIND OF LIKE WHAT IS THE HOW DOES A UNION COOP WORK SO JUST VERY QUICKLY DESCRIBE THAT. IT'S NOT REAL. UNION AND THEN IT SORT OF EMPLOYER WOULD RACK. BOB WORKERS. A SET OF WORKERS FREEDOM GETTING DE THAT THEN SO SHE SELECT A MAN I'M WHICH ONES YOU KNOW AND YOU BE WHO WAS ON THAT AGREEMENT SO THAT'S IT IN THAT WAY I BELIEVE IT'S SIMILAR THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THE VALUES ALIGNMENT THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE COOP IS BASICALLY INHERENTLY TIED TO THE SUCCESS OF THE UNION. AND OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THE COOP STRUCTURE INSTEAD OF THERE BEING LIKE AN ADVERSARIAL SORT OF BOSS WORKER DYNAMIC THERE IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY LOOP AND THERE'S A LIKE A BUILT IN CHECK ON POWER THAT DISABLES A SUBSET. OF PEOPLE FROM CAPITALIZING OFF THE LABOR OF OTHERS. SO I'M A TWENTY. TELL YOU ABOUT THE ALL THE ENDS THAT WE'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH. SO WHEN I A WE. JUST XIN THIS IS THE LAST. POINT THAT THIS IS NORMAL. ARE AT A LOT OF IN ORDER COOPER THROUGHOUT THE TREE IN AS YOU ALL SORTS OF INTO THESE IN FACT BRING CHILD CARE HOME CARE BOB IN UP TO MY FEET. AND THEN ALL I NOTED IN THE UP IN THE HAND OUT. THAT WE- PUT TOGETHER FOR THIS THEY HIGHLIGHTED THE GREEN. TAXI WORKERS COOP WORK WITH IN IN DENVER WITH C. WA. ANYWAY LEAVE THAT BUT I SO I JUST WANTED TO FINISH BY TELLING YOU ABOUT THAT THE AUDIENCE SO. THEY'RE A GROUP OF LPNS WHO. IS LIGHT OKAY SHALL NURSES. SO WE TRY TO TAKE CONTROL BACK UP THEIR WORK. HOUSE OF WATER IS. BEING PRIEST FRIENDS AND REYES THANK HELP. I'LL BE IN SCHOOL. SORT OF SHIFTING OVER TIME I'LL BE AND JOBS ARE BEING SHELLED HOSPITALS AND CLINICS INTO LONG TERM CARE AND SORT OF MORE DIFFICULT KIND OF BURN OUT SETTINGS SO THIS GROUP OF THEY WERE ALL WOMEN SO THIS GROUP OF WOMEN. DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO CREATE A CO OP WHERE THEY COULD DO VISITS IN PEOPLE'S HOMES IN CALIFORNIA WHITE LPNS CAN BE LICENSE CAN BE SUPRISED REMOTELY BY A PHYSICIAN. AT WHICH IS A MEANINGFUL THING FOR THEIR BUSINESS MODEL BECAUSE WHEN THEY VISIT SOME A PATIENT IN THE HOME THAT CREATES A- BILLABLE CLINICAL ENCOUNTER. SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THEIR THEIR MODEL IS BASED ON AND THEY THEY SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO BE REACHING. LOW INCOME COMMUTE COMMUNITIES SOME PATIENTS WHO ARE FACING TRANSPORTATION AND CHILD CARE AND OTHER SORTS OF BARRIERS TO SEEKING CARE OR ACTUALLY GETTING CARE IN CLINICS. SO THE ALL THE ENDS THEY FORMED A CO OP THEY HIRED PROFESSIONAL MANAGERS. THROUGHOUT COOP DEVELOPMENT FROM CALL THE GUY CA GROUP. THAT HELPS TO KIND OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND MANAGEMENT. AND THEN THE UNIONIZED WITH THE UNION A SUBSET OF THEM CREATED A BARGAINING COMMITTEE AND THEY BARGAINED WITH THE UNION. AND I AND I GOT TO BE A PART OF THAT FROM THE UNION SIDE WHICH WAS REALLY WONDERFUL. AND THEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST SET OF WORK WHICH WAS. THEY GOT A THEY DID A PILOT PROJECT PROJECT WITH SOME FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CLINIC IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES CALLED ST JOHN'S WELL CHILD. AND THEY DID A SET OF THREE HUNDRED VISITS TO PREGNANT WOMEN WHO RUN MEDIC HAL THROUGH A PROGRAM CALLED CPS P. COMPREHENSIVE PERINATAL SERVICES PROGRAM. WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE A SET OF VISITS FOR THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION AND SO LIKE LACTATION SUPPORT AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT PEONS ARE. PERFECTLY TRAINED TO DO AND SO I HAVE A HANDOUT THAT I'M GONNA LEAVE HERE FOR FOLKS ABOUT THAT FROM THE FROM THE COOP BUT BY BASICALLY EVERY KIND OF METRIC YOU COULD MEASURE IN TERMS OF PEOPLE SHOWING UP FOR VISITS AND HOW PEOPLE FELT ABOUT THE VISITS AND THE REVENUE GENERATED FOR THE CLINIC. THE PILOT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS. THE TWENTY TWO. LPNS WHO WERE EMPLOYEES OF THE COP. WHO ARE THERE ACTUALLY ALL BILINGUAL. AND THEY'RE ALL FROM THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE- PATIENTS WERE SERVED. THEY ALSO HAVE. REALLY WONDERFUL THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE SO I GUESS I'LL LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU RARE REALLY APPRECIATED HIS SOMEONE WHO'S AUTHORED AND CO AUTHORED NUMBER OF BILLS REGARDING HOME CARE WORKERS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE AND IN FACT. THAT POPULATION TENDS TO BE MORE MAJORITY WOMEN MANY FROM THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY TO LOOK AT LANDSCAPING RESTAURANT WORKERS USING IT A COMMON THREAD. OF UP ANY COMMITTEES WHO DON'T OFTEN ARE OFTEN EMPOWERED THAT AGAIN EMPOWERMENT TO THIS COOPERATIVE STRUCTURE WHICH I WHICH I REALLY LIKE TO SEE MORE OF AND SO THAT'S PART OF THESE ALREADY IN THIS HERE TODAY. BEFORE FURTHER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS UP HERE I LIKE INNER DO USE BETTY YOUNG WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY. OFFICE LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT THANK HER FOR BEING HERE. THIS MORNING ABOUT ANYTHING AROUND. SO I THINK THINK BODY FOR THE WORK THAT SHE'S DOING ON BEHALF OF WORKERS HERE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND THE SUPPORT OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THAT WORK AND I. HAVE A COUPLE OF AND ONE THING SUE YOU HAD MENTIONED BY THE WAY I'VE BEEN TO THE LAKE SHORE BAKERY ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AND HAVE. AND APPRECIATED. AND IS THE IDEA THAT THESE ARE STILL BUSINESSES LADIES ARE. I SOMETIMES PUTTING COOPERATIVES LIKE IT'S A COMMUNE OR SOMETHING. AND I KNOW THESE ARE ACTUAL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE TO RUN A PROFIT AT THE MAKE. MAKE THEIR PAYROLL. AND IDEALLY HAVE A HAVE A PROFIT AND IDEA I THINK IS SAID. THAT ITS IT'S BOTH THE PROCEDURES AS WELL AS THE WEALTH IS SHARED AMONGST THOSE DOING THE WORK. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS YOU WENT THROUGH. IS THE DIFFICULTY GETTING FINANCING. THAT YOU WENT TO TRADITIONAL BANKS AND CAN GET FINANCING. AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS INCLUDING AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT THAT BUT YOU KNOW THE TWO OF US WAS PART OF IN TERMS OF PUBLIC BANKS. BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT LIKE HOW DO WE GET BEYOND THAT FINANCING HURDLE IN THE PRIOR PANEL TO TALK ABOUT WAYS A STAKE IN THE HELP. BUT IS THAT THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT YOU SEEN IN TERMS OF CREATING COOPER IS ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES THAT. ARE ON EQUAL FOOTING. WELL I THINK. I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO MONEY I THINK IT DOES DEFINITELY COME DOWN TO MONEY BECAUSE I MEAN IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO. START A BUSINESS YOU'RE YOU NEED THAT CAPITAL RIGHT. AND NORMALLY WERE TALKING ABOUT WORKERS THE DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW THAT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO PUT INTO A BUSINESS. WELL WE STARTED PEOPLE WERE BUYING AND IT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND NOW IT. IF THE BUSINESSES ARE SUCCESSFUL I'M PAID BACK THEIR BANK LOANS IS DOWN TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH. SO NORMALLY SOME IS COMING TO THE BUSINESS AS HILLARY SAID AND THEY'RE JUST TAKING THAT. AND PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS SO YOU NEED THE CAPITAL TO START. THIS THAT'S THE- MAIN THING AND SINCE IT'S A COOPERATIVE I THINK IT'S HARDER. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT THE NORM UNITED STATES SOMETHING THAT'S HARDER TO GET. FINANCE THE OTHER CHALLENGES WOULD BE JUST CHALLENGES OF COMPROMISING COMMUNICATION. AND THE NORMAL JUST KIND OF LET'S GET THIS UP AND RUNNING. BUT I. THINK THAT IF THE FINANCES WERE THERE WHEN PEOPLE APPROACH US SOME PEOPLE APPROACH IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CREATE. YOU KNOW EIGHT. COOPERATIVES IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE DOING VERY WELL. AND THEY APPROACH US AND THEY'RE LIKE OH WE WANTED THERE'S A MANDY AND YOU KNOW. UP IN ARCADIA. AND I WAS LIKE OH WELL IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU'RE GONNA NEED LIKE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN WHO WERE IT WERE YOU GOING TO GET. YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO SIGN OFF ON THAT. SO YOU KNOW IT'S A REAL CONUNDRUM TO ME ESPECIALLY SINCE WE- WERE. WE INITIALLY GOT. A LOT OF SUPPORT WITHIN THE COOPERATIVE COMMUNITY THROUGH THE CHEESE BOARD. SO IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE THERE'S AN- THINK THE THINGS ARE NOT IN PLACE OUTSIDE OF THESE FANTASTIC PEOPLE THAT WERE PART OF OUR FIRST PANEL THERE HELPING PUSH THIS AGENDA. THERE'S NOT STUFF IN PLACE LIKE FOR THREE FOLKS TAKE THREE PEOPLE MEDICAL UP CODE THE SB SPDC AT CITY HALL. IT'S LIKE OKAY AND NOW WHAT. I MEAN SO I THINK IT'S JUST. I THINK. IT GET GOES BACK TO EDUCATION PS FROM THE EARLIER PANEL LET'S TALK ABOUT AS WELL. AND THANK YOU OF AN ELIZABETH ONE OF THE- OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT. SMART YARDS AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES IN A AND ESPECIALLY AS SOMEONE THAT CERTAINLY AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL FINDING WAYS TO MOVE INTO THE GREEN ECONOMY. MOVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS. BUT DO IT IN A WAY THAT A PLUS WORKERS AND THAT'S A OFTENTIMES PART OF THE CHALLENGE I MEAN LOOKED AT THE REALITY IS THAT A LOT OF THE POSSIBLE JOBS ARE REALLY GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS THAT PEOPLE ARE SENDING THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE. OTHER OF BUYING HOMES AND THEY'RE LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM AND YET A LOT OF THE JOBS THAT COMING IN THE GREEN SECTOR DON'T MATCH UP IN TERMS OF THAT EMPOWERMENT THE WORKER. AND SO YOU KNOW THE THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE YOU KNOW I OFTENTIMES TALK ABOUT ABOUT WHETHER SOLAR INSTALLATION OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN TERMS OF THE SMART YARDS. OF EMPOWERING WORKERS AND IN THIS KIND OF THE NEW GREEN DEAL KIND OF SENTIMENT. OF ENSURING THAT WE'RE EMPOWERING WORKERS AS WE MOVE IN THAT GREEN DIRECTION. AND SO I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU OFTENTIMES BRING UP WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WHAT HAVE YOU. AND SO THE WHAT IT WELL THEY ARE NOT FIVE COMMENT ON THAT ASPECT OF IT OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CREATING GOOD JOBS TO REPLACE. THE QUALITY JOBS EVEN IF IT'S IN THE BOSTON THE. QUALITY JOSH OF THOSE DOING THE WORK. IN THAT TRANSITION. ABSOLUTELY SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THE GREAT NEW GREAT DEAL. I WAS A LITTLE BIT KINDA HELD BLOCK COME FROM MOM MENTIONING THAT. BUT WE ARE REALLY DOING THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THIS ITEM SMALL VERY SMALL SCALE. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR. A FEDERAL MANDATE OR- YOU KNOW TO BE SIGNED WE CAN DO A LOT THERE'S A LOT TO DO. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE. THE COMMUNITY. NOT JUST IN FRONT THE SAN JOSE ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. REALLY ARE READY FOR THAT. THEY ARE READY TO TRANSITION. TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION TO STAR. WE LIKE I SAID I MEAN. THIS MORE YARDS IS A VERY. SMALL EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT. THE THESE TYPE OF WORK ARE REQUIRES A LOT OF SKILL. IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW LIKE OKAY WE TAKE OUR PEACE SO LONG ACROSS AND. AND DO THAT I MEAN IT'S SKILLS LIKE UGH. IRRIGATION SYSTEMS ARE OUT WHICH IS A LOT OF TRAINING DOING THE I MEAN FOR A GRAY ONE AND SYSTEMS PLANTING FRUIT TREES THERE IS A HUGE. DEMAND FOR LIKE PEOPLE WANT TO REALLY GROW THEIR OWN FOOD AND THE YARDS THERE'S A LOT OF WORK OUT THERE WE CAN START DOING IT AND YOU NAME IT YOU WE CAN CREATE. LIKE EVEN THAT MAKING THE MODEL IS WITH ORGANIC. YOU KNOW INGREDIENTS WE CAN CREATE AND IN FACT MY I ASK MY I ASK IS TO CREATE A CENTER FOR COOPERATIVES HERE IN SAN JOSE AND WE COULD DO THAT AND START HAVING THOUGHT EDUCATION WE NEED A BUILDING. I MEAN IF GOOGLE CAN GET SOME KIND OF SUPPORT BY THE. CITY O'DONNELL SAID TO HAVE YOU KNOW. HI TECH WORK IT WE COULD CREATE A CENTER FOR COOPER DOESN'T ALMOST A WHERE WE CAN MAKE THINGS. I MEAN ALSO THERE IS ANOTHER VERY INTERESTING THING THAT KIDS CAN BE ARE AS THE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN INSTEAD OF SPENDING AND PARENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SPENDING A LOT OF SCREEN TIME THEY CAN ACTUALLY BE LEARNING AND WE HAVE THOSE WORKSHOPS. WITH OUR YOUNG GIRLS LEARNING HOW TO USE POWER TOOLS HOW TO MAKE THINGS WITH THEIR HANDS THERE IS A HUGE BENEFIT. IN THAT ITSELF IN TERMS OF OUR OUR WELL BEING AND A PSYCHOLOGICALLY MENTALLY. PHYSICALLY TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO MAKE THINGS WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THAT. AND I THINK OUR PEOPLE ARE READY IT WOULD JUST THEY JUST NEED PEOPLE SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY. ANSWER THE QUESTION ON HOW AND WHY AND YOU KNOW HERE IT IS THE OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDE THAT SO. THIS BILL THAT CLUB UNDER HERE SOME OF THE OKAY. A SUMMER RIVAS. AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION AND- YOU KNOW IT'S A BASED ON THE TESTIMONY AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OBVIOUSLY THE FINANCING AND THIS INFORMATION GAP OF THE EDUCATION WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST IMMEDIATE STEPS THAT THIS THE YOU KNOW THE STATE LEGISLATURE CAN DO. TO SUPPORT YOU KNOW THE CREATION OF THESE CO OPS. I'LL TAKE A SHOT AT THAT THE FIRST THING AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD IN THE FIRST PANEL IS AROUND THE EDUCATION. AND AWARENESS. THAT THESE MODELS EXIST AND THAT THEY'RE NOT FRIENDS AND THEY'RE NOT THESE THESE THINGS THAT ARE ARE JUST. YOU KNOW MIRED IN ONE AREA OR ANOTHER THEY THEY THEY ACROSS SPECTRUMS ARE MANUFACTURING THE RETAIL THEIR SKILLED LABOR THERE SERVICE ORIENTED THEIR RETAIL BASE THERE ALL ALL OF THOSE. AND I JUST WANT TO BE JUST AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING AND I WENT THROUGH IN IN OUR BUSINESS. WHEN WE FIRST OPENED UP WE GAVE WE TRY TO BRING CORPORATE STUFF THAT WAS WE REALLY LIKED WITHOUT ALL THE OVERHEAD AND LAYERS THAT WE DIDN'T LIKE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT IS WE GIVE WE GIVE BONUSES TO ARE WE GET EVALUATIONS OF OUR WORK FORCE AND GIVE BONUSES. AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH IT WAS ALMOST HALF OF THE TEAM THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT A BONUS WAS. THEY DID NOT HAVE NEVER HAD A BONUS THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WHY YOU GIVING ME THIS MONEY I YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE IT BUT WHY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AS YOUR BASELINE OF POTENTIAL BASELINE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONE NOW GOING TO BE TALENTS WITH BUSINESS OPERATIONS GOVERNANCE READER PNL OR BALANCE SHEET. THERE IS A LARGE GAP OF BASE KNOWLEDGE THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT IN AND HOW DO YOU GET THAT EDUCATION. PUSHED INTO A WORKFORCE THAT IS WORKING SOMETIMES THIRTY FIVE FORTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK THEY HAVE FAMILY THAT THEY'RE RAISING THEIR ON MAYBE. TWO JOBS. AND HOW DO YOU INTEGRATE THAT INTO A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS THE WORK FORCE TO GET THAT EDUCATION AND NOT JUST TO CONVERT PEOPLE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONVERTING TO GET THE BASE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THAT'S WHAT. PROJECT WOULD HELP US DO IS WITH ONE ON ONE TRAINING IS WITH OUR TEAM AND WE ACTUALLY STILL RETAIN THE SERVICES OF PROJECT WOULD BE BECAUSE THEY'RE HELPING DO THAT KIND OF ONE ON ONE TRAINING. WITH OUR TEAM INTERNALLY TO BUILD UP OUR OWN BENCH STRENGTH. WE CAN. YEAH I THINK THE TO THAT CONTENT TO GIVE WORKERS NEW ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE WORKING IN A RESTAURANT OR OTHER TYPE OF BUSINESS AND ARE TOLD BY THE OWNER OF ONE OF YOUR TIRING SENATE EVEN KNEW THAT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO ASK CONTINUE AND IT SHOULD BE MORE POWER TO THE WORK THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING BECAUSE OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW IT'S SOME OF THE RESTAURANTS JOB YOU WILL HAVE WORKERS I'VE BEEN THERE FOR FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS AND- THEY- KNOW THE BUSINESS JUST AS WELL AS THE OWNERSHIP DOES. YET THEY DON'T KNOW THAT OPPORTUNITY EXISTS AND SOUGHT. TO BE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE FOLKS THAT THE EDUCATION PIECE. AND FORMING SMALL BUSINESS. SPD SEASON THOSE ARE ADVISING. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT IS EVEN AN OPPORTUNITY AT THAT THE THAT THE CITIES. COUNTIES CAN ALSO BE PART OF THAT EDUCATION PROCESS. CAN I OUR POINT OUT A LOT SO WE IT'S MY ARTS ARE COOL UP ALSO STARTED THE BECAUSE ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVES THAT'S EDUCATION. AND TRAINING A RICH AND WE STARTED A NONPROFIT SOME MEMBERS OF THAT BORE ARE HERE AND THE NONPROFIT ON THROUGH THE NONPROFITS HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET GROUNDS ON FUNDING BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AS YOU WE ALL KNOW HERE. AS FUNDING I WE START WITH MY OURS WAS THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS AND I HUNDRED DOLLARS DROP SOME USE TOOLS AND TO THIS DAY WERE WORKING OUT WITH SHOE STRINGS BASICALLY BECAUSE OF THAT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY THAT LONG AND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET. HOPEFULLY WITH PUBLIC BANKING IT WILL BE GREAT RIGHT SO WE CAN MAYBE WORK AND- TO GETTING LONGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT HOW DO YOU GET ALONG AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY AND WORKERS WE DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR THAT. SO IT WILL BE GREAT TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME KIND OF. FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO START UP. COSTS AND WE'RE STILL KIND OF DEALING WITH THAT. APPRECIATE THAT AND SO WE'RE GOING TO SEE THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE BUT WE DO HAVE COUNCILMEMBER MARGARET A CLASSICAL WITH US. HERE WHO'S ALSO BEEN A CHAMPION IN REPRESENTING A DISTRICT FIVE YOU SAN JOSE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR WORKERS AND CERTAINLY UP LOOKING. AS SOMEONE WHO ALSO LOOKS FOR INNOVATIVE WAYS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE AND IS TO IS A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY. SO NOW UP PUBLIC COMMENT. WHAT IT WILL DO THAT FOR A FEW MINUTES. HI ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA MY NAME IS QUÉ AND PANEL MY NAME IS CHAMELEON IS WHEN THE KNEE AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SOMEONE'S MAYFAIR. I WANTED TO SUPPORT WHAT I HEARD BY A LOT OF YOUR PANELISTS TODAY IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR HELPING TO INCUBATE COOPS AND GET EDUCATION OUT INTO COMMUNITY. TWO YEARS AGO WE FOUND OURSELVES AS A NON PROFIT IN THE MIDST OF HELPING TO INCUBATE A WORKER OWNER COOPERATIVE FOR THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY I KNOW THAT WAS A QUESTION. PRIMARILY MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKING WITH MAKE STATUS HOUSEHOLDS. I'M WE FOUND OURSELVES THERE BECAUSE OF A NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT NOT BECAUSE WE KNEW HOW TO DO IT SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS BECAUSE I THINK ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PANELISTS ORGANIZATION. HELPED US IN THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND THE CAPACITY BUILDING WE NEED TO HELP GET THIS CALL UP OFF THE GROUND. THAT IS LIKE THAT ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE PHILOSOPHIES OF COOPS IN TERMS OF WORKING AGAINST. COMPETITION BUT RATHER COOPERATION AND SO THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL. BUT I THINK IT TWO YEARS IN NOW SOME OF OUR LEARNINGS THAT I WANTED TO HOLD UP FOR ALL OF YOU IS THAT. THE AMOUNT OF TIME IN INTENTIONALITY ESPECIALLY WITH WORKING WITH SOME OF OUR MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES TO GET THEM TO. HAVING A PROFITABLE BUSINESS IS VERY INTENSIVE. OF THE AMOUNT OF LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT AT THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT THAT'S REQUIRED ON THE FRONT END. WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROCESS WE DIDN'T KNOW ALL OF THAT WAS GOING TO BE REQUIRED. SO SIMILAR TO WHAT ELIZABETH SAID YOU KNOW WE USED OUR NONPROFIT STRUCTURE TO SECURE PRIVATE FUNDING TO THEN. REINVEST IT RIGHT BACK INTO THE INCUBATION OF A COOPERATIVE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE MOST SUSTAINABLE MODEL. IT ACTUALLY THEN PERPETUATES COMPETITION AMONGST NON PROFITS AS WELL. SO I THINK ANY WHERE YOU CAN HAVE MORE PUBLIC FUNDS I'M INVESTING DIRECTLY INTO THESE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THE BETTER. AND THEN I WOULD ADD THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SB DC'S OR OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN INVEST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. MAKING SURE THAT IT'S NOT ONLY ON THE BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS. BUT ALSO SUPPORTING THE SOFT SKILLS OF COOPERATION NEGOTIATION. CONFLICT RESOLUTION BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORKERS HERE TODAY I MEAN I THINK THOSE HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST CONVERSATIONS. AND SO WHEN YOU ARE COMING FROM A SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY FRAME. AND YOU'RE WANTING TO BUILD COMMUNITY WHEN YOU TRANSITION INTO THIS PLACE OF BUSINESS SOME OF THE- CAPITALISTIC TENANTS JUST. NEVER REAR THEIR UGLY HEAD BACK INTO THE SYSTEM SO LIKE A TON OF LEARNING. THAT WE'VE HAD IN THIS PAST YEAR BUT I'M I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT HAVING THAT. OUR STATION I. HUNDRED SUPPORT BETH. YEAH A. I AM NO WELL GOES FROM A MINIMUM BREWING CO OP I'M ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE'RE NOT WORKER COOP THAT I'M HERE BECAUSE WE LIKE TO OFFER. WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORTER ONE. WHEN I WAS A DEMOCRATICALLY RUN BUSINESS WHERE MEMBERS DO EVERYTHING FROM DESIGN YOUR RECIPES TOASTING FUND BEER RELATED EVENTS THE SELLING AND MARKING THE BEER WE'RE ON MEET UP SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT WE DO THERE. WE CURRENTLY CONTRACT BROUGH HER TIES IN SAN JOSE NOT THAT FAR FROM HERE IN EAST CLIP BRING IN SANTA CRUZ. WE DON'T HAVE A PHYSICAL LOCATION. YET SINCE RENTS ARE SO HIGH. WERE BASED OUT OF SAN JOSE BUT WE HAVE MEMBERS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP FEE YOU MUST BE TWENTY ONE TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK MOST TO YOU HERE CAN CALL FIRE TO JOIN US. SO. YEAH. YEAH ON ALSO PERSONALLY I I'VE HIGHER DOES THIS COMPANY FOR MY YARD AND IT'S AWESOME OKAY ANYWAY SO OUR MEMBERSHIP ALLOWS PARTICIPATION AT ALL AND THE NUMBER OF EVENTS AND CLEAN MONTHLY TASTING OF OUR BEER ABILITY TO BUY A PAIR OF ALSO PRICES IN TO BECOME PART OF BAY AREA BE OUR COMMUNITY AND EACH MEMBER DECIDES HOW AND HOW MUCH THEY LIKE TO BE INVOLVED. SO THAT'S ABOUT IT SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. THANK YOU FOR THAT YES OUR OUR BEERS IN SEVERAL LOCAL RESTAURANTS SOON AND BARS AND AS WELL AS STORES THEM ANYWAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT BRIEF COMMERCIAL ARM AS- AS A MEMBER AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CRAFT BREWING ALLOW IT. AND COUNCILMEMBER CARRASCO WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS ARE THERE WITH YOU I JUST YOU KNOW YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THERE HAS BEEN ASK OF MORE COOPERATION NOT JUST FROM THE CITY BUT FROM THE CITY THE STATE LEVEL TO SUPPORT COOPERATIVES WELL AND IN THIS ISN'T AN THIS ISN'T A NEW CONCEPT BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY A GROWING CONCEPT AND BECAUSE THAT THERE'S A GROWING NEED AND I YOU KNOW I KEEP SAYING THAT OUR OUR OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR SOCIETIES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMPLEX. OUR ISSUES ARE BECOMING VERY COMPLEX AND NOW SO ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR TOOLBOX I THINK IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE IT AND I WANT TO THANK OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR ALWAYS HAVING HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF OUR COMMUNITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE GET INFORMATION THAT WE NEED IN OUR TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SUSTAINABLE BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE WELL EDUCATED AND THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO. TO HIM BUT TO OTHERS THAT ARE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD THERE'S AS YOU HEAR THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE. ARE ARE DOING A LOT OF REALLY WONDERFUL WORK. THERE ARE MAKING SURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS ARE VERY WELL INFORMED AND ARE WELL REPRESENTED. OP I'M ALWAYS MARVELED AT THE AT THE NATURE AND THE MAKE UP OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE I REPRESENT THE EAST SIDE OF SAN JOSE. CAMILLE WHO YOU JUST HEARD US SPEAK UP IS A WONDERFUL LEADER IN IN MY DISTRICT AND I LOVE THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. AND I LOVE IT BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES AND THE PERSEVERANCE OF OUR OF OUR RESIDENTS THERE'S NO OTHER DISTRICT THAT I WOULD RATHER REPRESENT. IN THE EAST SIDE OF SAN JOSE THE PROBLEM IS THE POSSIBILITY AND THE POTENTIAL OF THE EAST SIDE. IS. REALLY UNBELIEVABLE AND SO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE KIND OF CONVERSATION IS REALLY WHAT ALLOWS US TO. HELP OUR RESIDENTS FLOURISH AND BLOSSOM SO THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK THAT FOR ME I WAS IN HERE FOR THE FOR THE FULL CONVERSATION OBVIOUSLY. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE ARE ASSISTING IT HOW DO WE FIND IT HOW DO WE HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AND HOW DO WE AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR THIS AREA FINE FACILITIES AND COMPETE IN A VERY. COMPETITIVE REAL ESTATE MARKET SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE QUESTION MARK OVER EVERYBODY'S HEAD SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS OBVIOUSLY. BUT IT'S JUST VERY IRONIC THAT I JUST LEFT A MEETING WITH A BUSINESS OWNER. WHO SAID HOW DO WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF ROCK THAT IS A- VERY IMPORTANT CORRIDOR IN MY DISTRICT. BECOMING VERY ACTIVATE IT SO THAT ALL THE BUSINESSES DON'T GET SQUEEZED OUT AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY ENJOY THE PROSPERITY THAT'S COMING INTO THE EAST SIDE OF SAN JOSE. WHAT A TIMELY CONVERSATION SO MORE TO COME AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF FOLKS HERE WILL BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE OF COURSE THE PANELISTS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE THANK YOU COUNCIL MEMBER US. ALSO. MEMBER BECAUSE- THOSE WERE THE BEST OF ALL.

AND MISTER PIKE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE CONGRESS MEMBER WILL KIND OF WHO'S BEEN A VERY PUBLIC SUPPORTER OF WORKERS OPERATIVES. YEAH HI IF THIS IS A GREAT SESSION THANKS FOR. OSSIAN EVERYONE FOR PUTTING THAT TOGETHER I DID WANT TO JUST KIND OF GIVE A QUICK UPDATE AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE MAIN STREET.

FEDERATION OF WORKER COOPERATIVES AND A FEW OTHERS. TO COME UP WITH SOME OF FOLLOW UP BILL THAT WILL COVER SOME ISSUES THAT WILL HELP. FACILITATE THAT PREVIOUS BILL INCLUDING.

SO THAT WOULD BE ONE ELEMENT AS WELL AS GRANTS AND EDUCATION AND RESOURCE OPPORTUNITIES. IS ZAND THE PANELIST IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL POINTED OUT REGARDING MIAMI IF A COMMUNITY IS NOT USED TO IT YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE THE BUSINESS PITCH ON THE BUSINESS SENSE. AND CLEARLY IN CONGRESS CERTAINLY THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY COMPROMISED K. SET UP. YOU'VE GOT A YOU GOTTA MAKE SOME PITCHES THAT ARE GONNA HIT THE BIPARTISAN CELL AND I THINK THAT THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR A WORKER COOPS REALLY THERE IS A THERE IS AN ARGUMENT RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY THE SILVER TSUNAMI THE- SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE OWNED BY BABY BOOMERS THAT ARE TRYING TO TRANSITION. AND THEN SHOWING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A WORKERS TO GO FROM SWEAT EQUITY TO BUSINESS EQUITY. AND SO I THINK THERE IS A REALLY SOLID BUSINESS ARGUMENT THAT CAN BE MADE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WILL BE LOOKING TO DO THAT. DO OUR PART I KNOW THE STATE AND THE COUNTY THE CITIES ARE DOING THERE'S AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO PASSING THESE LAWS THEY CAN HELP FIRST WITH THE CONVERSIONS AND THEN ALSO BASICALLY LETTING PEOPLE SEE HOW COWORKER ACOSTA WORK. AND SO THEN WE CAN YOU KNOW IS SUPPORT START UPS AS WELL WHICH IS ANOTHER ELEMENT SO THANKS VERY MUCH WE'RE WORKING AT OUR. LEVEL AND I KNOW EVERYONE ELSE'S TOO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TOM.
