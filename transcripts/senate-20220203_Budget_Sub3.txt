ANALYSTS AT STANFORD JONES DIRECTOR OF THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AS YOU KNOW WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN CREATING THAT CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. CALIFORNIA IS REIMAGINING THE SYSTEM SUPPORT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH AGES ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE UTILIZING A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH. AND ENSURING THAT YOUNG CHILDREN'S AND YOUNG PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS SUPPORTED IS KEY WE ALL KNOW TO THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AND WELLBEING CHECK THEIR LEARNING. AND WE KNOW IT'S CONNECTED TO LIFE OUTCOMES. SO WITH THIS INITIATIVE WE ARE WORKING TO BUILD A COORDINATED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES RESOURCES AND COMMITMENT TO ALL KIDS THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE THAT WILL FOCUS ON PROMOTING WELLBEING AND PREVENTION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. AND I'M ROUTINELY SCREENING SUPPORTING AND CIRCLING ALL CHOKED AND USE OUR EMERGING AND EXISTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE. A KEY AREA OF FOCUS FOR CALLIE CHEST IN THIS FIRST YEAR IS LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR THE APPROACH TO DOING THE WORK OF DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING THAT THAT CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE WE KNOW AND MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS HAVE EMPHASIZED TO US IN RECENT TIMES. SIMPLY ADDRESSING INDIVIDUAL ISSUES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT. SITE LOOKS JUSTIN'S. BUT IT'S SYSTEMS LOAD APPROACH IS NEED THAT'S BACK AND SETS UP. TO BE A MAN AND REDESIGN. HOW THE JUST WORK AND IN A REAL. TO THAT WE CAN BUILD A COORDINATED INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND THAT'S HOW THAT'S HOW WE APPROACH THAT WORKS WORK MATTERS IN ADDITION TO THE WEST BECAUSE THE CHEATING DIFFERENT RESULTS WILL TAKE DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY. OUR PLANNING WORK OF THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAS BEEN ROUTED IN THE RECOGNITION THAT THAT SHOULD BRING YOU BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS A CRITICAL APPROACH EACH MAKE SYSTEMS LEVEL CHANGES. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THEM I'M GUIDING APPROACHES THAT WORK. WHAT IS A REAL FOCUS ON MOVING UPSTREAM AND INCREASING OUR FOCUS ON PREVENTION. FOCUSING ON ALL CHILDREN ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THOSE WHO BASED THE MOST SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO WELLNESS INCLUDING CHILDREN YUTH COLOR LGBTQ PLUS YOU AND LOW ICOME AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES EQUITY IS REALLY A DEFINING FOCUS. AND PRINCIPLE OF THE WORK. CENTERING THE VOICE. OUR EXPERIENCES DURING YOUTH AND FAMILIES READING A SYSTEM WITH NO LONGER WORK IT'S REALLY OUR OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE BEYOND SILOS AND ROUTE A REDESIGNED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ECOSYSTEM IN CROSS SECTOR AND CROSS SYSTEMS COLLABORATION INCLUDING HEALTH AND EDUCATION WHICH INCLUDES EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR TRIAL AND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER SECTORS IN SYSTEMS THAT HELP ADDRESS IN SUPPORT OF WELL BEING OF CHILDREN YOU. WERE WORKING TO TAKE A POPULATION BASED APPROACH WE WANT EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDS KIDS TO SUPPORT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH WELL BEING AND A KEYNOTE YOU ADDRESSING THIS IS WORKING ON AWARENESS AND STICKMAN AND SPECIFICALLY AND. CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND RELEVANT WASTE. I JUST WANNA I NOPE THAT D. IS THESE KINDS OF ARE REALLY WHAT ME TO WORK OF THE- YOU'D BE HERE FOR HEALTH AND IS FIVE. VERY HONORED TO BE PART OF THE WORK AND I'VE BEEN IN MY WILL FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MINUTES NOW HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN HEALTH POLICY FOCUSING ON UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS SPEAKING AT IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND HEALTH STATUS ARE PARTICULARLY ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES. MY ROOTS IN MY EDUCATION ARE IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SO. AND AS I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK INCREASINGLY ONLINE. AT BODIES OF WORK AND ALL THE SYSTEMS LEVEL APPROACH LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BUILD POLICY FUNDING AND PROGRAM FRAMEWORKS THAT ARE HOLISTIC AND INTEGRATED THEM. I'M CHIU INCREASE IMPROVE HEALTH AND HEALTH EQUITY AND THAT IS THE CORE OF THE WORK AND THE CHILDREN YOU HIT RUN HEALTH AND STRESS AS. I SAID I'M VERY HONORED TO BE A PART OF THAT. TELL HHS UNDER TO. SEVERAL F. TO DO. TO THE FRAME. FOR THE WORK HEY WITH THE- YOU BEHAVIORAL. STANCE ON SENSE THE CIVIC. WHERE DEVELOPING PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN A DRAFT GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE. WE'VE ALSO WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF H. TO DEVELOP SET OF MILESTONES ACROSS THE FIVE YEARS FOR THE POLITICAL OPPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE. FOR COORDINATING AND INTEGRATING ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT OF HHS. REGULAR MEETINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND CROSS DEPARTMENT MEETINGS. WE'RE ALSO HAVING A SERIES OF CROSS DEPARTMENTAL PLANNING MEETINGS WE ARE REALLY LOOKING SHOULD BLACK GENOCIDE. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE NEED FOR COORDINATED WORK. AGAIN GOES BACK TO THAT ISSUE AFFECT THE CRITICALITY OF ADDRESSING SILOS. WITH RESPECT TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WE ARE MEETING WITH A RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS AND MULTIPLE FORMS AND FORMATS SHOULD LISTEN AND HEAR ABOUT THE KEY ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES. TO AND STRANGE. THIS INCLUDES A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS. TO BUILD A STRONGER UNDERSTANDING OF EDUCATION SYSTEMS. OR NETWORK OF HHS DEPARTMENTS ON THIS INITIATIVE. I THINK THIS DEEPER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION SYSTEMS IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO. A COLLABORATION THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO REALIZE THE POSSIBILITY. OF THIS INITIATIVE. WE'RE ALSO IN THE OF. A COUNTRY STAKEHOLDER ENGAGED PLAN HOW THE AGE WILL STAKEHOLDER THROUGH WHAT'S SESSION WORKSHOP. ARE THEREFORE SPECIFIC TO THE INITIATIVE AS WELL AS OTHER EXISTING BRANDS SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TASK FORCE. INDIVIDUAL HHS DEPARTMENTS ALSO BE DOING DIRECT. ENGAGEMENT AND THE AGENCY IS WORKING WITH DEPARTMENTS TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO SUPPORT COORDINATION OF STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT SAID WE AREN'T DUPLICATING EFFORTS ARE CREATING CONFUSION ARE BURDEN SEVEN. ARTICLE. ARTICLE ARE. ALSO PARTICULARLY FOLK ON AND YOUTH FAMILY ENGAGED WE ARE TO AND THAT CAN GIVE IN THE WORK OF THE INITIATIVE. WE'RE CURRENTLY MEETING WITH ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXPERTISE AND YOU DON'T NEED FOR AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WE WILL BE UTILIZING THE INSIGHTS WISDOM THE ADVICE FROM THOSE CONVERSATIONS CHIU SHAPE AS- ECSTATIC G. AROUND I'M TELLING YOU TRANSLATE CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES IT'S PART OF OUR PLANNING EFFORTS. AND AS WAS IN THE A GENTLEMAN. WE ARE AND AFTER AN INITIAL LANDSCAPING. ALL OF NAY ISSUES NOT ONLY SPECIFICALLY IN THE CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE BACK CONNECTED AND RELATED SHE WENT ACROSS BOTH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION AND BEYOND. WE SEE THIS IS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR COLLABORATIVE WORK AND PLANNING GOING FORWARD. ARE ALSO. CHIU AND ISSUED A PROCESS TO SET SPECIFIC FIVE YEAR OUTCOMES GOALS AND WILL BE WORKING WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER NETWORK. I'M FOR COMMUNICATIONS WE ARE COMMITTED CHIU PROACTIVE AND TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATIONS AROUND THE BURKE AT THE INITIATIVE IN DECEMBER WE RELEASED A AND INITIATIVE BRIEF ON OUR WEBSITE. CURRENTLY WORKING ON AN UPDATE THAT WILL ALSO BE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND SENT OUT STAKEHOLDERS THAT INCLUDES A LIST OF ALL OF THE COMPONENTS UNDER THE INITIATIVE A FIVE YEAR MILESTONES EACH. OPPONENT'S ADDED UPDATE ON THE CURRENT WORKING ACTIVITIES ARE HAPPENING IN EACH OF THOSE. AND LASTLY CAL HHS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE INITIATIVE WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING BACKGROUND WORK TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT AS AN ART TEACHER SELECT AN EVALUATION EARLIER THIS YEAR. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THESE UPDATES AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- THANK OU AND I WAS AT THAT REMISS IN NOT THAT IT WILL CONTINUE- TO WELCOME TO THIS POSITION WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T SEEN. THAT SINCE YOU SINCE THEN WE'VE WE'VE DONE THIS- AND I WAS READING SOME OF YOUR BACKGROUND. IT'S JUST IT'S QUESTIONS LIKE HOW HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR WORK. WITH THE ROLL OUT OF THE ACA. WILL AID YOU IN THIS I MEAN WHAT DID YOU LEARN NUMBER WE'RE GOING TO TAKE FORWARD AND- HOW TO HELP. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. YES I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ARE OUT THAT IN REGION NINE TO REALLY ACROSS THE WEST AROUND THE ROLLOUT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS I THINK THAT WORK WELL AS DEEPLY DEEPLY I AM DEAD IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THE GROUND AND IN COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT FOR SYSTEMS CHANGE WORK TO OCCUR IN A MEANINGFUL WAY WE REALLY HAVE TO CONNECT. STATE LEVEL POLICY FUNDING FRAMEWORKS WITH THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE BI DIRECTIONAL WORKING TOGETHER THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE APPROACH THAT I TOOK AND TOOK TO THE WORK ON THE ACA IMPLEMENTATION. AND I THINK ANOTHER IS THAT THERE HAVE TO BE A WILLINGNESS TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT'S WORKING AND MAYBE WHAT'S NOT AND WHAT COULD BE DIFFERENT IN ORDER TO REALLY CENTER THE CHANGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OF OUR- OVER SERVING AND SO I THINK IN THIS CASE THAT REALLY GOES TO THE STATE TRAINING ON CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES. AND THEIR EXPERIENCES IN TERMS OF. AND SUPPORTING THEIR WELLNESS AND HOW WE- YOU KNOW I THINK SYSTEMS WERE CREATED IN SILOS OFTEN AND THAT IS THE CASE HERE AND WE HAVE WORK TO DO TO RE ORGANIZE THOSE SYSTEMS IN A WAY THAT IS REALLY CENTURY. I'M THE NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES IN THE PRIORITIES AND STRENGTHS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH I THINK WE CERTAINLY SAW THAT IN THE ACA WORK WHICH IS ACT I'M- IT'S REALLY CRITICAL CHIU FOCUSED ON THE HUMAN LEVEL. WHAT PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE IN ORDER TO ENGAGE THEM AND SYSTEMS CHANGE WORK. AND THEN THE LAST OBSERVATION I WOULD TAKE IT IS THAT AND IT TAKES AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP I TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE AND ARE WORK AROUNDS THE ACA AND I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE HERE. THANK YOU FOR THOSE INSIGHTS AND I THINK YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON AND I THINK IT'S JUST AS YOU'VE AS YOU ALLUDED TO THE CHALLENGES VERY LARGE RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY AS WE TOOK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. ENGAGING WITH OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS WERE A LOT OF THIS WORK WILL BE DONE AND IF WE THINK ABOUT THAT. OUR SCHOOL SETTINGS RIGHT NOW HAVE REALLY BECOME GROUND ZERO FOR A LOT OF THE- DIVISIBLE SIMPLY ALREADY THAT WE'RE SEEING. AROUND UP AND SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP TEAMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN DIFFERENT REGIONS THAT MAY HAVE BECAUSE I MEAN IF WE WANT THINGS TO BE EFFECTIVE WE HAVE TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. WITH RESPECT AND IN IT AND A REAL DESIRE TO HELP- SO ARE YOU SO I GUESS MY I GUESS MY REAL QUESTION IS AROUND. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE BILL THE LACK OF WORK FORCE OR THE AT THE DIFFICULTY IN IN FINDING WORK FORCE RIGHT NOW. HAVE YOU INCOME THAT AS WELL AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT TEAMS ON THE GROUND WHAT DO THAT LISTENING. AND TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DEVELOP WHAT WE'RE DOING IS STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK AWAY THAT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH- COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES IN WAYS THAT ARE IT. IS EFFECTIVE FOR THEM. IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT QUESTION I THINK THAT I AM. AND WE- WERE VERY A PERSON I AM VERY PERSONAL AT THE TIME THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TAKE IN MY FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS TO REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES THAT NEED T BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THIS WORK AND SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO THANK OUR EDUCATION STAKEHOLDER PARTNERS WHO BEAT AND HAVING A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH REALLY. ENGAGING MORE DEEPLY AND UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS YOU SAY THERE ARE TIMES. YEAH OUR OUR SCHOOLS WE KNOW HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGED AND WROTE IN THE WORK THEY'RE DOING AND I SPEAK ABOUT PERSONALLY AS WELL MY HUSBAND IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER. I AM. AND SO I THINK OUR PARTNERSHIP THERE IS REALLY CRITICAL SO WE'VE BEEN WANTING TO PLAY A LOT OF GROUND WORK AND WORK ON THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND WORK ON THE UNDERSTANDING THESE TWO SYSTEMS THAT HELP THE- EDUCATION AND- HOW DO THEY CONNECT TO YOUR POINT WITH THE STATE LEVEL AND- THE LEVEL I THINK WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW IS IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL TO ARTICULATE. A STATE. LEVEL FRAMEWORK WHERE. WHEN THEY SPEAK. IS WORKING THE WAY WE ALL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY. POWERFUL ABOUT MY FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS IN THE WILL IS HOW SHARED THE VISION IS AROUND THIS WORK FROM A RANGE OF PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS THERE'S JUST SUCH SHARED VISION ABOUT. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO REALLY RETHINK THIS ECOSYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AND COMING AT IT FROM THAT THAT PERSPECTIVES AROUND. AND ARTICULATING THOUGH WHY NINETY BECAUSE SYSTEM IS WORKING REALLY WELL WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONALITIES AND CAPABILITIES IT HAS. AND WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC OUTCOMES. AND YOU KNOW FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH OVER FIVE YEARS AND- ARE. AT THE SAME TIME IT'S CLEAR THT HAS TO BE PAIRED WITH AS YOU STATE. I'M ARTICULATING AND SUPPORTING THE FRAMEWORKS AND MODELS THAT CAN BE USED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO IMPLEMENT FACT BECAUSE NOT GONNA LOOK THE SAME EVERYWHERE IN DIFFERENT. PROPERTIES UNITY'S THERE WILL STILL. CONSISTENT WITH PARTNERS BUT EXACTLY HOW THAT ORGANIZED THERE'S GOING TO BE SUCH. AS IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE DURATION WE HAVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITIES THE WORK IN THE INDUSTRY IS TO BE CAN. TO PARTNER WITH OUR AND- STATE. TO OUT. WHAT OF SUPPORT OUR NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE BUILDING OF THAT ECOSYSTEM ACROSS PARTNERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SH AND HOW DO WE UTILIZE BOTH. THE TOOLS AND COMPONENTS THAT ARE WITH IN THIS AND SHOULD SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT MANY OTHER THINGS HAPPENING IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION AND BEYOND. ALSO SEEK TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. ARE LINKED AND NOT SPEAKING ROCKLEDGE COMMITTEE TO KEEP. EXPECTING C. FIELD ABOUT THE TEMA. WE'RE WORKING ON IT YOU I HERE COME OF MONTHS. YEAH IT'S JUST SECRETARY AND IN PLACE WE ARE BUILDING OUR TEAM WE HAVE A PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AND PLACED AND- I WE WILL BE FINDING A PARTNER TO. READ AS YOU WERE DESCRIBING THAT THAT IT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PARTICULARLY AROUND CHILDREN AND YOUTH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. REALLY DOING THAT AND IN A VERY AUTHENTIC WAY AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE ALREADY BEEN HEARING FROM THE EXPERT. INTERVIEWS WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING WITH. ORGANIZATIONS AND LEADERS THAT ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN DOING FAMILY AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT WORK AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS THAT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE ENGAGING WITH A NETWORK OF TRUSTED PARTNERSIN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THAT I'M OUR WORK NEEDS TO BE REALLY SUPPORTING THOSE ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE NEED TO INFORM THE WORK OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH HIP-HOP INITIATIVE AND SO I DO THINK RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE. WE WITH AND JUSTICE WORK. AND AS WE BILL THAT WE'RE STILL ABLE TO PROVIDE A I KNOW WE JUST HAD MORE MONEY FOR MOBILES FOR THAT BRIDGE SUPPORT I KNOW I HAD A SUICIDE OF A JUNIOR HIGH STUDENT MY DISTRICT THIS THIS LAST WEEK I MEAN IT'S JUST. THE CRISIS IS NOW- TOPICS OR DO I JUST SAY AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO DR PAN NOW- AND JUST I GUESS I GUESS THE- THE- MY- MY LAST WORDS TO YOU ARE JUST NOT MY LAST BUT- THERE'S URGENCY.

GETTING ON STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT SO FORTH AND CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO HAVE A TREMENDOUS DEMAND RIGHT NOW NEED RIGHT NOW CERTAINLY WAS COATED- THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FACT THAT WE HAD SO MANY- YOUTH AND CHILDREN WHO'VE LOST. CARETAKERS AND GUARDIANS- YOU KNOW THE OTHER STRESSES THAT THEIR FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH- THERE'S CERTAINLY A LARGE DEMAND RIGHT NOW AND SO WELL CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND YOU NEED TIME TO TRY TO GET INPUT AND SO FORTH. WE CAN ALSO SIT STILL WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO RUN IN PARALLEL RIGHT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE THE. KERR EFFECT I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS THAT. IN IN THIS PER. IS THERE AXE S. OF THE DEMAND FOR THE SERVICES YOU'RE PLANNING TO PROVIDE- YOU KNOW. WE DID BUDGET NOW THREE AND A HALF BILLION SO IS THAT ENOUGH IS THERE SOME IS THERE SOME EFFORT TO TRY TO ALSO. ASSESS WHAT IS THE ACTUAL GIVEN THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING- WHAT'S THE ACTUAL DEMAND THE GOING TO BE IN ORDER TO MEET. MEET THE NEEDS. OR PUSHING IT BACK QUESTION THANK YOU SENATOR AND I'M- ON THE ISSUE OF THIS. YES BUILDING AND AN ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THERE ARE GAPS AND NEEDS IT WILL BE HAPPENING WITHIN VARIOUS COMPONENT PARTS OF THE INITIATIVE. SO YES THAT IS PART OF THE WORK AS WELL AS I THINK IN OUR- CONVERSATIONS AROUND HOW TO SUPPORT. BUILDING THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES THAT ARE NEEDED. AND AT LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS I THINK THAT IS WERE ALSO THERE NEEDS TO BE ASSESSMENT AS- BUILT INTO THIS PROCESS OF BUILDING ECOSYSTEMS. REALLY LOOKS AT WHERE ARE THOSE GAPS SO WHAT ARE THOSE NEEDS SO YES I THINK ASSESSMENT AND- FINDING THE GAPS IS A KEY PART OF THE WORK. IN A MONSTER MILESTONES WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THAT ASSESSMENT TO THE THIRD TO BE COMPLETED- WHEN WE SHOULD PERFORM BY. SO IT IS NOW FEBRUARY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO- WE BUDGETED THIS AND WILL YOU JUST CAME OUT TWO MONTHS AGO WE BUDGETED THIS. FOR STARTING JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO READY. EIGHT MONTHS SAID- WHEN TWO WEEKS THIS TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU YES THERE ISN'T ONE I STAFF THAT CREATED THERE WILL BE ASSESSMENT WITH IN VARIOUS. OF THE INITIATIVE RELATED TO SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF IT WHETHER THAT'S RELATED TO WORKFORCE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING FOCUSED ON WEATHER RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE OTHER PIECES THAT ASSESSMENT PIECE IS BY A COMPONENT WHICH AND EACH COMPONENT IS ON A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TIMELINE IS AS YOU KNOW BY ENABLING LEGISLATION AROUND ACCESS. YES THAT EACH THAT IS OUR MILESTONES FOR EACH INITIATIVE SORT LAYS OUT THERE TIMELINE AND PROCESS UP SO RAPIDLY WINDY UNITED A VERY REALIZES AND MAYBE ONE GRAND ASSESSMENT BUT SOMETHINGI WENT WHEN WILL YOU START GETTING A PICTURE OF WHAT THE DEMAND IS GOING. GOING TO BE. AND TO DISSIPATE THAT BY. YOU KNOW THE SUMMER. NECK FALL. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW IN JUST A LITTLE MORE DETAIL TOGETHER AROUND THE TIME LINES AROUND SOME OF THE ASSESSMENT COMPONENTS THAT WE CAN OKAY ALL RIGHT AND AGAIN THIS SPEAKS TO AND I REALIZE AGAIN YOU JUST CAME OUT TWO MONTHS AGO INSISTS THAT THIS IS THE URGENCY PART RIGHT AND TRYING TO- THE OTHER THE OTHER QUESTION WHY FOLLOW ASK ALSO IS THAT AND BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MENTION IT AT LEAST IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL LAST YEAR. AND I AND IT WAS A BIG PART OF PROPOSAL ACTUAL THIS PLATFORM THIS UNITARY PLATFORM AND THERE'S GONNA BE A CONTRACT FROM DCS TO IN FACT I THINK I ASKED ABOUT WILL WHO YOU KNOW IS THERE AN EXISTING MODEL THAT WE'RE PURSUING. FOR THIS PLATFORM THAT'S GOING TO BE THIS UNIFYING YOU KNOW I. T. PLATFORM TO DO IS THAT STILL BEING PURSUED IT IS THAT- PARO IS THAT STILL PART OF THE PLAN OR AND IF IT IS WHAT THE PROGRESS TOWARD THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO BRING ON BOARD. SO- SO I JUST WONDER WHAT THE STATUS IS ON THE ON THE PLANNING IN TERMS OF THIS THIS PLATFORM DATA IS GOING TO EXPOSE UNDERLIE MANY OF THE EFFORTS AND- AND THEN. PROVIDE SIR THE INFORMATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION YES THE- PASSPORT IT'S A PART. PART THE CHILDREN YOU. SHOULD YOU NOTED. GOING TO HELP CARE SERVICES A LEADING THE TO. OF THAT. AND SO THEY ARE DEVELOP A- BROKE WORK PLAN AROUND. THE DEVELOP AND ULTIMATELY. OF THE- VIRTUAL PLATFORM OKAY FIVE GIVE ITS KEY ROLE THE SENATE ORIGINAL CONCEPTION AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE AT THE END OF TIMELINE ON THAT AND WHEN WE EXPECT THAT TO BE YOU KNOW. UP AND RUNNING OR- EARLY STILL WHAT THE SO. AT LEAST THE IS THE SENATE IT'S A- ITERATION. PLAYED A PRETTY KEY ROLE AND TYING THINGS TOGETHER SO I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT AND ALSO WE ARE WHICH- IS THE LAST YEAR BUT SORT OF FOLLOW UP IS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS WHAT EXISTING MODELS I MEAN RETREATING SOMETHING COMPLETELY BRAND NEW WHICH OF COURSE IS HAS ITS OWN CHALLENGES. BUT I MEAN HOPEFULLY WE'RE BASING IT ON. OTHER PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THAT WE CAN POINT TO SET THIS IS HOW THIS THING WOULD WORK SO I APPRECIATE IF WE CAN GET TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. YES THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUR SERVICES WE CAN WORK WITH THEM TO BRING YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BUT THEY ARE DOING. BACKGROUND IN PLANNING WORK THAT DOES INCLUDE LOOKING AT A RANGE OF EXISTING MODELS BUT LESSONS ARE TO BE PARKED. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO. YOU HAVE A TIME ASSOCIATED WITH. OKAY YES I MEAN AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS IS GONNA BE A KEY QUOTE FOR. OF IT TENURE KNOXVILLE A LOT OF YOU DON'T A PLATFORM RIGHT- IS THAT. BEHIND. THIS IS MENTION WORK FOR- WE KNOW WE HAVE. WE HAVE A OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET. INCLUDING BY THE PARTS CAN BE TALKING ABOUT LEADERS IN THE VERY HEARING IS ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE. ROLE COURSE CENTER. I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T TRAIN. A. B. HEALTH SPECIALIST INSTANT. AND FOR. ARE IT TAKES A LOT OF. TIMES SKILLED TO TRAIN SOMEONE UP- THE- IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MAXIMIZE- PEOPLE PEOPLE WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WHO ALREADY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAMILIES- WE DO HAVE TRAINING IN MENTAL HEALTH.

YEAH THANK YOU FOR QUESTION TIME YES SO AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS RELATED CHU IN THE HEALTH SETTING THE WAYS IN WHICH PRIMARY CARE. PROVIDERS AND PEDIATRICIANS ARE A PART OF THE INITIATIVE SO I'M ONE OF THOSE AS YOU KNOW IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE VIRTUAL POP YOU WERE JUST ASKING ABOUT HAD THAT. VIRTUAL PLATFORM INCLUDES. I'M AROUND BEING ABLE TO CONNECT. BITERS WITH SPECIALIST IN IN THE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHILD PSYCHIATRY TO REALLY SUPPORT I PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN AND PEDIATRICIANS AND TREATING THEIR PATIENTS SO THAT PEACE IS BUILT AND IT WILL BE PART OF THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM SH I YOU MAY RECALL ALSO A PART OF THE CHILDREN U.

AND REALLY SUPPORTING I HAVE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF EACH JUST SCREENINGS AND OBVIOUSLY THAT IS ENACTED ALTERNATELY DEPARTMENT WHICH- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. NUMBER WORK AT BECAUSE ACTION THAT ARE REALLY. I THOUGHT AWAY AS WELL. OKAY NOW I. THAT I IT CERTAINLY. THE WORK OF THE GENERAL IN THE ACE PRO WHICH SALAS COURSE THAT PROCEEDS AND UP. I WOULD MAKE NO THAT WE DENTAL BEAR TO PRIMARY CARE FOR. BE ABLE TO HELP AND PARTICIPATE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT FORMALLY OF. MANUAL MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL THERE'S ISSUES THERE YOU TALK ABOUT THE ATTIC CARE. YOU KNOW THE PEDIATRICIAN OF ANY TEACHERS MEDICAL LIABILITY. REFORM THAT ALLOWS ME TO. NOT GET SUED FOR PROVIDING CARE TO APPARENTLY ON OUR- REFERRING YOU KNOW THE PARENTS FOR CARE- THAT THAT THAT. THAT SO SOME OF THOSE HOPEFULLY WILL ADDRESSED AS WELL- SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY- DO THE KIND OF- WORK THAT BEING ENVISIONED. AND THEN- SO AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER JUST A FINAL QUESTION AND- I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE MORE AS FOR THIS PROGRAM OF ALDEN AGAIN VERY VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. AS SOMEONE WHO'S- VERY. INTERESTED IN THIS FIELD- HELLO WE ARE FOR ON THIS IS FOCUS ON YOU CHILL AND YOUTH. NOW ARM YOU KNOW WE SERVE HAVE OR MENTAL SYSTEM IS KIND OF. WE HAVE A COUNTY. RIGHT AND THEN WE HAVE. WE HAVE SOME THE SCHOOL AND HE ICE TO BE A SCHOOL FOR- MET CONSOLE FOR MY LOCAL SCHOOL THIS- HOW HOW YOU SEE. SORT OF BRIDGING. SERVICE WE- THE BE OF SERVICE COUNTY MAY HEALTH WHERE A LOT OF THE DEBT. MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS CHANNELED THROUGH. MANY OF SCHOOLS. HOW DO YOU SEE BRIDGING. THE SCHOOL AND COUNTY A SPACE IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY. AND AND INVITING THE SILO THAT SOMETIMES EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWO. YES IT DOES I MEAN THAT IS THE HEART OF THE WORK THE INITIATIVES THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. I THINK IT ACTUALLY THAT'S THE FIRST STARTING ZERO IS THIRTY TO BUILD WAS RELEASED. AND PARTNERSHIPS. AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME KEY. AT THE INITIATIVE THAT ARE STILL BASED ON. PROVIDING RESOURCES AND SUPPORT WHAT WERE AND THE PARTNER AND PROJECTS THAT COME OUT OF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF THE CRITICAL. AND ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM AS YOU WERE DESCRIBING BOTH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SCHOOLS THEMSELVES ELEAZAR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ALSO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE BUILD NOT ONLY DOES THE INDIVIDUAL INFRASTRUCTURE EACH COLLABORATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE BETWEEN THEM. AND DOING SO IN A WAY WHERE WE ARE REALLY CENTURY WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE YES I THINK. WE ARE WE NEED TO BUILD. OUR SHIPS AND COLLABORATION AROUND THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE SO TO SPEAK THAT ORIGINAL TABLE. TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHERE ARE THIS IS A KEY PART OF OUR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WORK WHERE ARE THOSE SILOS WHERE ARE THE BARRIERS TO GREATER INTEGRATION AND GREATER COLLABORATIVE WORK AND THEN HOW DO WE ADDRESS THOSE. SO THAT THAT REALLY IS THAT THE WORK TO CONTACT I DO WANT TO JUST ALSO SHARED THAT QUESTION THAT BOTH YOU AND TERMINATE MEMORIES AROUND. THE URGENCY OF THIS ISSUE. AND I WANT YOU. I IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OF ALL I KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE STATE. OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. WHICH WE KNOW IS ACTUALLY- UNFORTUNATELY LONG TERM CARE THESE ISSUES WHERE WORK INCREASING UNFORTUNATELY WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND WERE EXACERBATED AND THE PANDEMIC CHECK YOUR LATE WE ALL KNOW FOR OUR CHILDREN USED TO COLOR LGBTQ. YOUTH AND LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND THESE ARE LONG TERM AND ISSUES AND CHALLENGES THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AND TRANSFORMATIONS AND WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT HARD WORK IN THE CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE HAPPENING TODAY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND THAT WORK IS HAPPENING THERE ARE THERE IS WORK HAPPENING BOTH WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF STATE GOVERNMENT WITH OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND IN COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW. AROUND REALLY ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT ALL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INTEREST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BE REALLY OF WORK H. THAT THERE ARE LEAST AVAIL TO CHILDREN YOU AND FAMILIES BUT ABOUT FIVE BONE TAXED WEBSITE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ONLINE RESOURCES PEER TO PEER COUNSELING THAT IS AVAILABLE IN SOME CASES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE THE CALHOUN RIGHT LIKE. LINES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND WEBSITE AND OPTIONS OUR CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES BETTER BAILABLE IN THE MEDIA SUPPORT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS AROUND. REALLY THAT ARE PROVIDE AS MUCH ACCESS AS- CHIU THE SERVER THAT ARE. TODAY I TERMINATE WHEN EARLIER THAT READ INVEST. IN ABOUT IN OF HEALTH CARE SIR ON PRICE RE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ON GOING INVESTMENTS ALREADY AND WAY LIKE THAT THAT ARE WORK. TO REALLY INCREASE THE THAT WE HAVE NOW THERE'S WAITED FOR SAM CHEAP EVEN DURING LIKE. TO REQUIREMENTS AND APPROPRIATE WAY BUT I CAN OF OUR OUR STRATEGY HAVE. TO BE ABLE TO DO AND OF SERVICES AND BABY LAST TIME ON THE DOCKET. ISSUES I'M STILL WORKING THAT WERE MADE IN THE BUDGET LINE YEAR IS YOU KNOW CHIU. AND THE COURTS OF THE WORK THAT IS ACT THE EMBLEM OF EIGHTY AND- WORK THAT HAPPEN IN COMMUNITIES TO DO THAT NOW SO THERE IS. AND WORK NOW THEN THERE'S A WORK AT YOU KNOW ALL REALLY TO ON. AWARENESS AND HEALTH IS AND MAP WHICH WE KNOW WE REALLY DID IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO SEEK SUPPORT PURPOSES BY PAYING. SO THERE ARE THESE MULTI INITIATIVES AND EFFORTS HAPPENING NOW AS YOU SAY IN PARALLEL WITH THE LONGER TERM MARKET THE CHILDREN IN THE HIP HOP. AND THE RECOGNITION OF HOW INCREDIBLY. BOTH PART IN THAT. HE ALSO COMMITTED SHOULD SURE THAT THOSE. ARE IN. SO THAT WE LEARNING FROM MUCH AND WORKING ON THINGS THEY'RE HAPPY NOW TRUE REALLY MAKES WERE IN. THIS LONGER WORK. OKAY WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MAYBE TO ONE. BRIEF ADDITIONAL COM BECAUSE IN THE SAN- MY FRIEND CENTER. AND I'M- PLEASE REPORT TO HIM. ON IS ALSO TRUE TO BE SURE GET SCHOOL STAFF PERSONNEL ALSO TRAINED SO THEY CAN IDENTIFY USE OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO I HOPE THE GOVERNOR WILL SUPPORT THAT TYPE LEGISLATION BUT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I GUESS JUST. TO PUT UP TO PUT IT TO PUT A LITTLE RIBBON ON THIS. AS MUCH MONEY AS WE PUT IN HERE. DIRECTOR. WHEN DO YOU FEEL LIKE ONE THE PUBLIC WILL WILL FEEL C. WILL FEEL THIS MASSIVE INVESTMENT AND HOW WILL THEY KNOW WHAT WHEN THEY SEE IT WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON IT AND I MENTION THIS VERY BRIEFLY BUT IS ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC OUTCOMES THE INITIATIVE AT THE END OF THE FIVE YEARS AND WE WILL BE ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS NOT PROCESS AND INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY TO REALLY HELPED SHAPE THAT THE SPECIFIC OUTCOMES AND THOSE OUTCOMES WILL NEED TO BE I THINK A COMBINATION OF LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM IS IMPROVING. AND LOOKING AT SPECIFIC OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH ON A POPULATION BASIS AS WELL SO I THINK IT WILL BE A COMBINATION SO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ARTICULATE THOSE OUTCOMES AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO COLLECTIVELY WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS THEM AND THAT WE DO AS I MENTIONED WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FINDING AN EVALUATION PARTNER AND I THINK IT IS OUR HOPE AND INTENTION THAT THAT EVALUATION PARTNER WELL NOT JUST- HELP US GAUGE. OUR PRO. AFTER THE FIVE YEARS BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIVE YEARS WE WILL BUILD IN PLACE TO STRUCTURE. IN ORDER TO ROUTE YOU ANSWER ASK AND ANSWER THAT QUESTION YOU'RE RAISING WHICH IS HOW DO WE KNOW WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. THESE TO BUY I'M- UNDERSTANDING FOR MY OWN WORK AND THE RESEARCH AROUND MAJOR SYSTEMS CHANGE TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVES THAT THEY GENERALLY TAKE EIGHT TO TEN YEARS. THE ALLIES THEIR FULL POSSIBILITY. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PROGRESS WE CAN AND YOU NEED TO MAKE IN THESE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND THAT I'M- READING WITH A SET OF OUTCOMES THAT'S GOING TO ANCHOR AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK BACKWARDS FROM IS GOING TO BE REALLY KEEP IT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. OKAY THANK YOU AND I'VE BEEN I'VE I THEN I YOU FEEL AND HAVE HEARD THE URGENCY THAT WE ALL FEEL- OKAY SHOULD WE MOVE ON TO EQUITY IN LANGUAGE ACCESS PROPOSALS. BRENDAN MCCARTHY WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET INCLUDES A NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS DESIGNED TO ALLOW THE COUNTY TEACHERS IN OUR MEMBER DEPARTMENTS TO MANAGE OUR VARIOUS PROGRAMS IN A MANNER THAT'S MORE INCLUSIVE ENACTED PROVES THE OUTCOMES FOR THOSE PROGRAMS ALL CALIFORNIANS SIR RIGHT. I WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON PROVIDING LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO OUR PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES. TO THAT END KELLY CHICHA. ESTABLISHED THE EQUITY DIVERSE AND SUBCOMMITTEE THAT SUBCOMMITTEE IS CULTURE BY MARCEL RUIZ AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND ROMANCE RON RADHAKRISHNA THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE SUBCOMMITTEE INCLUDES. HEALTH ACT THE CHIEF EQUITY OFFICERS FROM ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS. AND THAT TOO MANY WILL OVERSEE THE EXPENDITURE OF THESE INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE AGENCY. I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT TALLY HHS ISN'T ACTIVELY RECRUITING FOR OUR OWN CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER TO OVERSEE OUR EQUITY EFFORTS ARE BROADLY ACROSS THE AGENCY. I DON'T SINCE MAY IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDING EQUITY DASHBOARD WHICH MY COLLEAGUE JOHN HANEY AND WILL ADDRESS AYE HE'S UP NEXT LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE HE WILL ADDRESS THE EQUITY DASHBOARD IN HIS REMARKS. INCLUDE STOP FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE EQUITY TRAINING APP OR AGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND SO THAT IS BACK TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF TO HELP IMPROVE THE RACIAL EQUITY OF OUR PROGRAMS I AM SURE THAT THEY ARE SERVING FOLKS IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER IN A CULTURALLY. AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE WAY. HI IT ALSO INCLUDES TIME WHEN ACCESS POLICY SO ARE- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND SELENA EFFORTS ACROSS OUR AGENCY. TO DEVELOP A POLICY FOR- PLAYING WHICH ACCESS TO OUR PROGRAMS. REALLY TO LEVEL UP ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS SO THAT WE'RE PROVIDING SERVICES AND ACCESS TO OUR PROGRAMS AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE WAY. BUT AS AN AGENCY WE PROVIDED AN UPDATE ON THAT WORK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT THE POLICY WILL ADDRESS. WE ARE NOW WORKING TO FINALIZE THAT POLICY- WE ARE WORKING BOTH INTERNALLY ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENTS AND ALSO WITH THE EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER HOLDERS. AND WE ARE- THE PLAN IS TO BRIEF LEGISLATURE BEFORE WE ARE FORMALLY ADOPT THAT POLICY TO GET THAT THE LEGISLATURE HIM MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO IMPROVE LANGUAGE ACCESS ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED SPENDING OF THOSE FUNDS WILL BE GUIDED BY THE LANGUAGE ACCESS ACCESS POLICY- THAT MONEY OTHER WAS INITIALLY APPROPRIATED TO THE AGENCY WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WILL- STAFF UP TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICY. AND IN THE LAST- ADDITION IN THE BUDGET YEAR WAS FUNDING FOR A POST CODE IN EQUITY ANALYSIS AS WE ALL KNOW- THE IMPACTS OF CODE HAVE BEEN DESPERATE ACROSS OUR DIFFERENT. EIGHTIES AND- HAVE HIT. HARDEST SOME OF OUR LOW INCOME ETHNIC COMMUNITIES RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE. AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT HOW COLD IMPACTED THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE SPONSORED. TO LEARN LESSONS THAT WE CAN APPLY BOTH TO OUR ON GOING OVER ALL PUBLIC HEALTH WORK BUT ALSO OUR PREPARATION FOR FUTURE WEATHER. DISASTERS WHETHER THEY ARE PUBLIC HEALTH- VERSION SEIZE OR OTHER DISASTERS SO THAT WE CAN- BETTER ENSURE THAT OUR RESPONSE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INEQUITABLE IMPACTS OF THOSE DISASTERS. SO THAT'S AN OVERVIEW OF OUR EFFORTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE WORK FIRST EQUITY TRAINING COMPONNT CORRECT RIGHT NOW CORRECT. OKAY IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO DEBT AND EQUITY DASHBOARD I JOHN HEANEY AND IT'S GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT PRESENTATION. OKAY OKAY UNDER TRUMP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DO APPRECIATE THIS- FOCUS ON- EQUITY AND LANGUAGE ACCESS SAYS- CHAIR OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CAUCUS- LANGUAGE ACCESS IS A- IS A GREAT. BIG BERRIER FOR OUR COMMUNITY HAND- AND OFTENTIMES WE ARE TOLD THAT WELL WE SPEAK TOO MANY LANGUAGES BECAUSE- YOU CAN'T JUST DO ONE LANGUAGE YOU GOT THERE'S A LOT OF LANGUAGES- SO THE COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO- TO ASK ACTUALLY. AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THIS EFFORT- SO- WHEN IT COMES TO- CONNECTED I USUALLY LIKE THE WORD USE THE WORD INTERPRETING NOT TRANSLATING BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A LITERAL TRANSLATION IT DOESN'T NECESSARY CONVEY. THE INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE NEED- THOSE WERE LOOKING AT- SO FIRST OF ALL I SEE A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT DOCUMENTS AND WEBER YOU KNOW WEB PAGES AND SO FORTH- BUT WE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF- THAT ONE- JUST LIKE ACTUALLY IN ENGLISH THERE MAY BE SOME LITERACY ISSUES RIGHT SO. YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT'S THE GRADE LEVEL RATE HOW IS IN THESE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES LIKE ARE WE USING LANGUAGE OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND. EVEN IF IT IS A YOU KNOW IT IT IS IT IS TRANSLATED RIGHT SO WHAT IS THE- YOU KNOW HOW COMPREHENSIBLE IS IT AFTER IT'S BEEN TRANSLATED SO IS THAT IS THAT BEING ASSESSED. AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT FOR SOME LANGUAGES AT LEAST A- THEY'RE NOT REALLY I MEAN. THEY CAN BE WRITTEN BUT THERE USUALLY MORE OR ALSO. THAT WE PROVIDE. ALTERNATIVE WAYS THAN SIMPLY- A YOU KNOW A DOCUMENT THAT'S TRANSLATED. AND THEN AND THEN OF COURSE THE OTHER PART SO APPRECIATE TRYING TO MAKE DOCUMENTS KEY DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND SO FORTH. WHEN IT COMES TO LANGUAGE ACCESS IT'S NOT JUST THE DOCUMENTS IT'S BEING ABLE TO INTERACT SO YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE A OFFICE A PATIENT ADVOCATE THAT'S AN INSIDE STRAIGHT WHEN THEY CALL CAN I GET SOMEONE OF THESE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. WHEN THEY NOTICED IT AND I THINK AS TO WHAT THE HEART OF WHAT TO- EGGMAN ASTOR. ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HELPING. TO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WHEN THEY SEE THIS DO THEY KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THIS INVESTMENTS IT IS THAT THE DAY ACTUALLY CAN GET ACCESS RIGHT I MEAN IT'S ULTIMATELY. WHAT THAT MEANS SO- PERHAPS CAN YOU TOUCH ON- YOU KNOW TERMS OF NOT ONLY IS IT BEING. TRANSLATED BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BEING INTERPRETED AND IT'S BEING DONE AT YOU KNOW AND THAT THAT IT'S TOUGH TO FOR COMPREHENSION AND IN THAT LANGUAGE. AND THEN ALSO ARE ABLE TO. US WITH. SO THAT- NEWS AGAINST LANGUAGE- MAYBE TO. FOR ISN'T A- THE BEST WAY TO CONVEY. THE INFORMATION. THANK YOU DR PANDA X. QUESTIONS AND YOU KNOW I'M STARTING WITH THAT TRANSLATION BOERSE'S INTERPRETATION IS A VERY GOOD POINT YOU MAKE AND YOU KNOW IN THE WORLD OF HEALTH CARE HUMAN SERVICES GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. A LITERAL WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS OUR PROGRAM SO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING. THAT IS PART OF THIS WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHAT WE'RE PRODUCING IS LINGUISTICALLY AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOR OUR TARGET AUDIENCES SO THEY CAN'T REALLY HAVE. ACCESS TO OUR PROGRAMS- THAT INCLUDES AS YOU MENTIONED MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT IS ACCESSIBLE SO THINKING ABOUT. THE BOOK THE LANGUAGE IN THE INTERPRETATION. BUT ALSO THAT THE GRADE LEVEL THAT IT'S WRITTEN ESTIMATE THESE ARE BROADLY AVAILABLE WHEN WE'RE NOT EXCLUDING ANYONE BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW THERE LITERACY AND IN. ENGLISH OR OTHER LANGUAGES. I'M YOUR QUESTION ABOUT ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS HILLS IS A VERY GOOD ONE SO I WANTED. TO WITH OUR TEAM AND GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION I WANT TO GIVE YOU. A GOOD ANSWER ON IT BUT IT'S A WELL TAKE A POINT. I'M AND I WOULD SAY IT'S YOUR LARGER POINT- IT'S NOT SOLELY JUST ABOUT TRANSLATING DOCUMENTS SO THAT THAT A DOCUMENT FORM- I'VE DONE A REPORT IS ON A WEBSITE THAT'S- TRANSLATED BUT IT'S ABOUT ACCESS TO SERVICES SO. OUR PROGRAMS ON THE GROUND LEVEL ENSURING. THAT OUR LANGUAGE POLICIES ALLOW PEOPLE ACCESS OF BOTH. ROLLING IN OUR PROGRAMS BUT THEN BEING SERVICE SO IN CONNECTICUT MAKING SURE THAT. PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING MEDICAL SERVICES BUT THEY ARE GETTING THEM IN A LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE WAY THAT MEETS OUR OUR BENEFICIARIES WHERE THEY ARE- SO THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE IS AS I SAID WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING TO TRANSLATE. SOME DOCUMENTS ON THE STATE WEBSITE REALLY THINK HOLISTICALLY ABOUT. HOW PEOPLE CAN ACCESS. ALL RIGHT APRIL THAT LOOK FOR TO SOME THAT. ON HOW YOU FOR THAT YOU. I THINK VERY MUCH HI TO PROCEED. GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE JOHN- HANG IN HERE- CHIEF DATA OFFICER FOR CALLIE JUST ON THE DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER OF THE INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION I MEAN I COVER I JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THE EQUITY WORK THAT WORD I SIGNED WITH. WE'VE BEEN DESIGNATED THE PLACE TO DEVELOP THAT THE EQUITY DASHBOARD AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AN EQUITY DASHBOARD TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE EQUITY DATA GAPS AND DISPARITIES AMONG OUR CALENDAR JUST HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS- WE'VE BEEN A PART OF THE JOB I. COMMITTEE AND CONSTANCE. AND THE AREAS THAT WORK. PARTICULARLY ON A DATA GAPS WHICH STARTED AGAIN IN MAY LIKE EQUITY- DATA COMES. FOR INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OUR PROGRAM- BE ACTUALS SERVED POPULATIONS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SERVED. WITH OUR PROGRAMS THERE AS WELL AND THEN POPULATION NEEDS AND DISPARITIES- WHICH IS STATE ON HELPING THE SERVICE- NEED TO TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIANS BITE OUT QUICKLY- DEMOGRAPHICS- AND CHARACTERISTICS TO INFORM PROGRAM AND- A PROGRAM STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH ENGAGEMENT- ARE DELIVERABLE RIGHT NOW IS HIS TARGET FOR APRIL- I. HAVE TO CONFIRM THE EQUITY OUT FOR THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT PLAN AND WEBER OUR TIES. AND DATA. AND TO HAVE PHASE ONE OF THE EQUITY DASH LAUNCHED BETA ONE HI OSCAR. TWENTY TWO TWO. ALL THERE FOR QUESTIONS. AT I'M SORRY HER DEBUT THE PEOPLE YET. WE ARE WE HAVE AN- BEING SLOW AND WE HOPE THAT THE PERSON POSITION THAT THIRTY DAYS. OUR BUT WOMEN CONTRA TO A PLAN THAT ALONG IT AFTERWARD A PERSON COMMENTING AND RUN- WE'VE FOR TO BE ON SOME EXPERTISE THAT WE- CAN OVER THE PAST YEAR AND- IN TERMS OF THE- OF THE ALL HAZARDS. WHAT IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SHARING- FOR DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT SO SOME OF THE GROUNDWORK IS B. DONE OKAY THANK YOU THANK- NO IT REALLY SO IT'S THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF PROTECT WHEN I COME TO THE API COME. IS THAT WERE VERY LARGE TO HIGH SAID WE WERE A WEEK WE TO PUT A TO PEOPLE FROM THE LAW CUT IN THE WORLD AND LARGEST- OCEAN IN THE WORLD. AND SO OFTEN TIMES WHAT IS- IF WE DON'T DECIDE- WE ACTUALLY- AND FOR- HI TO ISSUE- THAT COME UP SO LET'S JUST TALK KOBE ACTUALLY- SO FOR. TO POINT CENTER COMMUNITY HAS THE HIGH DEATH RATE OF ANY RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS. THAT WE JUST DO API WASHED OUT OF IT. THAT'S INTERESTING IS WITH ABOUT WHEN ACCESS- THERE'S SOME INDICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE WELL ASIANS LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOING WE WOULD NOT DO AS POORLY- POLITICO BID BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME STUDIES LOOKING AT. ASIAN TO ONLY SPEAK. THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE AND DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH ACTUALLY DO VERY POORLY. BUT IF YOU JUST WATCH IT ALL TOGETHER YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS STILL DO YOU DON'T SEE THIS DISPARITIES. SO. CAN YOU JUST MAYBE SPEAK TO- DASHBOARD IN TERMS OF THE AT. BE SURE THAT WE DISAGGREGATE. THE SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY- DON'T THE THESE DISPARITIES WITHIN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THEY THINK AT THE OFTENTIMES WE TALK ABOUT- THE API COMMUNITY UNFORTUNATELY EITHER TO AN H. P. I GET OVERALL HELLO HI HOW ARE OR OTHER SUBGROUPS- GET MAST WHEN THEY'RE ALL GROUPED TOGETHER. SO I WOULD SAY THAT BAD ACTORS PROBABLY BETTER ONCE WE GOT OUR FRAMEWORK ON BY APRIL WE WOULD HAVE AN IDEA THAT I THINK WHERE WHERE. I'M TRYING TO LEAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW IS. WHAT ARE WE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE AND SO I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL AND THAT ADDITIONAL- INPUT IN TERMS OF THE END IN MIND. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TRACK WILL ALLOW US TO PROBABLY BETTER PLAN OUR EFFORTS SO. WE WANT TO HAVE A TOOL. NUMBER ENOUGH. TO BE ABLE TO- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT- TO BE ABLE TO DRILL AND- TO THAT CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND- I THINK THAT'S- PROBABLY THE BEST ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU AT THIS POINT. REPLY THIS INVOLVES I THINK THIS IS OF COURSE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE API COMMUNITY AND- OF COURSE ALSO TO BE SURE WE GET ACTED INFORMATION I DO APPRECIATE FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR- IF YOU'RE A FACULTY BUDGET WOULD PUT IN SOME FUNDING- FOR. UCW FORM SOME VERY IMPORTANT SOCIAL SERVICE RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT NEEDS OF DIFFERENT SUBGROUPS IN THE API CAN HOPEFULLY THAT. CAN HELP CONTRIBUTE TO. YOUR- TO HAVING A DASHBOARD THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY- INEQUITIES AND BEEN VERY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS T. HAS HISTORICALLY A- AN ISSUE WITH THIS OFTENTIMES NOT BEING COUNTED AND SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE EVEN WHEN WE- IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS ASKED FOR INFORMATION ON PASSED BILLS. BY THE DATA STILL IS NOT COLLECTED. SO WHAT APPROACH IS ARE YOU ARE YOU TAKING ON TO THINK ABOUT- IT ESPECIALLYSINCE A SEXUAL ORIENTATION BILL TO BE TAKE COMMUNICANTS ACROSS ALL OF THESE. DEMOGRAPHICS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. WITH SOMETIMESPEOPLE DON'T SELF REPORT- THEIR IDENTITY YEAH I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION IT'S ACTUALLY THE WHEN WE THINK OF INEQUITY DASH FOR THE FIRST OUTWARD WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH OUR TEAM IS THE DASHBOARD THAT ADDRESSES THE MISSING DATA- WE KNOW THAT AS WE TRY TO BRING A PERSON CENTRED VIEW AND BRING DATA FROM. ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS TOGETHER EVEN DIFFERENT APARTMENTS QUITE DIFFERENT DATA SOME DATA IS NOT COLLECTED AT ALL SO UNDERSTANDING. GAP START TO THEN IN OUR SERVICE DELIVERY EFFORTS. TO FIND EITHER WAYS TO OBTAIN THAT DATA OR BUILD INTO SERVICE FEATURE SERVICE. DELIVERY VERY EARLY ON IN TERMS OF I GOT FIND GAP SOME THEY ARE. BRING THEM TO ABLE TO THAT DE. THEN TO BE ABLE TO WHERE THE NEQUITIES ARE AND ADDRESS NOT JUST SITTING UP THERE. SO WE SEE IT AS A- AS A CLASS. TOOL BOTH A PRIVATE FOCUS WELL AS A- BASIC. PATCHWORK. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE YOU WORK FOR EQUITY AS WELL. NO I WAS TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON THAT EXTREME FRAMEWORK ONE THIRTY THREE OKAY. HELLO REAL QUICK I JUST A- TWO MINUTE- ST OKAY- ON JULY TWENTIETH. GOV NEWSOM. A ONE THIRD THREE BUT CAL. ON PATH TO BUILDING A AND HUMAN SERVICES DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK. THAT WILL ADVANCE IN GOVERNING THE EXCHANGE OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH INFORMATION ACROSS THE STATE. WE ARE IN AGGRESSIVE- WE'RE ON AN AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE TO DELIVER A DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE EXCHANGE. A SINGLES SINGLE DATA SHARING AGREEMENT AS STRATEGY FOR DIGITAL IDENTITIES BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE CAN BE IN THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP CHAIRED BY SECRETARY CALLED. WHICH HAS A WIDE REPRESENTATION OF TWENTY SEVEN ORGANIZATIONS AND THIRTEEN DEPARTMENTS WITH DEEP EXPERTISE AND ARE ENGAGED IN MAKING THIS A REALITY. WITH HELP FIVE MEETINGS AND HAVE ALMOST SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS COLLECTIVE WORK. TO DATE WE'VE ESTABLISHED GUIDING PRINCIPLES THAT ALIGN WITH FEDERAL AND CATHOLIC CHURCH. PRINCIPLES FOCUSED ON CONSUMER AND PATIENT PROTECTION. FOR WORKING ON MODELING SCENARIOS TO IDENTIFY DATA EXCHANGE GAPS. AND ARE DEVELOPING RECOMMENDED STANDARDS. POLICIES AND REFORMS. OUR SYSTEM FOR THREE THEME THAT WE THINK ABOUT A THE DEVELOPER OF THIS EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK. ONE IS THAT. STAKEHOLDERS AGREE QUESTION ABOUT SOURCE OF FINING SUPPORT FOR IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDING BUILDING NECESSARY H. I. T. CAPACITY. PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. KELLY DRESSES EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ALIGNING EXISTING STATE EFFORTS AT IDENTIFYING FEDERAL PRIVATE SECTOR AND PHILANTHROPIC RESOURCES THAT MAY BE LEVERAGED ADVANCED PROPOSALS THAT CONFLICT WITH THE TECHNO TECHNOLOGICALLY AGNOSTIC MANDATE OF THE DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT TECHNICALLY TECHNOLOGICALLY AGNOSTIC OFFERING. AND THIRD FUTURE POLICY GUIDANCE THIS WORK IS BEING DONE VERY QUICKLY AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF MANY STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUPS AND WHILE WE ANTICIPATE MEETING THE LEGISLATIVE WE ARE REQUIRED DEADLINES POLICY GUIDANCE WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED BEYOND THE JULY. LEGISLATIVE DEADLINE TO CLARIFY MORE COMPLEX AND DETAILED ISSUES WILL RETURN TO LEGISLATURE IN APRIL WITH A MORE DETAILED UPDATES AND INFORMATION ON HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO REALIZE THAT VISION OF AB ONE THIRTY CREEK. THANK YOU. BAKER MACHINE. ACTUALLY TO COURT TWO QUESTIONS POINTS ALTHOUGH THE COUPLE DIFFERENT- AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK AND THIS IS A THAT YOU ARE AN AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE I APPRECIATE THAT SO ON ONE LEVEL ON ONE HAND- I GUESS CAN YOU TO SPEAK TO EXAMPLE DATA SECURITY RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA BUILD EXCHANGE WHICH MEANS EVERYONE'S EXCHANGING DATA WITH EACH OTHER THAT'S GOOD- BUT ALSO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT SOMEONE CAN'T TAP INTO THE EXCHANGES WHO SHOULDN'T BE. AND- AND THEN TO DOUBLE DOWN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE SO- HE TALK ABOUT PERHAPS SOME OF THE STEPS. BEING TAKEN TO ENSURE DATA SECURITY AND THE FRAMEWORK. OR EXCHANGING DATA THEN ON THE FLIP SIDE THOUGH- TALK ABOUT MONEY GET GREATER ACCESS TO DATA- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN KOBE- PERHAPS IS THAT. BEING SURE PUBLIC HEALTH ACTUALLY AS ACCESS TO A LARGER AMOUNTS OF DATA TO BETTER DO SURVEILLANCE AND IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S UPCOMING. HAZARDS OR OR BETTER MANAGING EXISTING ONES LIKE COATED OR OTHERS. AND SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ALSO ENSURE THAT- PUBLIC HEALTH. HAS IT HAS THE- BUT ACCESS BUT ALSO THE RESOURCES TO ANALYZE DATA THAT MIGHT BE COMING THROUGH THE EXCHANGE. SO I REALIZE THAT MAYBE POINT TO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT- WANTED SECURITY THE OTHER ONE IS YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT ON A POPULATION BASIS WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. OF THIS DATA TO PROTECT PUBLIC. SURE AND I WILL SAY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WATCHING THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE GROW OVER THE LAST TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE- AND ALSO FOCUSING A LOT OF MY CAREER ON. HELPING BRING SOCIAL-SERVICES TO. BUT THE INFORMATION SHARING AS WELL AND LOOK AT THE SOCIAL TERMS. IT'S EXCITING TO SEE THE STATE. AT THIS POINT- WHAT WHAT I THINK WE'RE LEVERAGING IN THIS APPROACH AND THE BEAUTY BEHIND IT IS THERE ARE SO MANY ALL ALREADY EXISTING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND REALLY WHAT THIS IS LEVERAGING THOSE- AND THE WORD YOU MIGHT HEAR OVER TIME IT'S INTERMEDIARIES WHICH ARE THESE ENTITIES THAT ALREADY IN THE BUSINESS OF. HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT MAN CANNOT ON BOARD- ENTITIES PROVIDERS- OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE EXCHANGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TO YOUR POINT OF UNDERSTANDING THE SECURITY. AND THE AND- THAT AFTER THAT HAPPENS THERE. SO IT'S REALLY A NETWORK. OF NETWORK APPROACH- AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE STILL TECHNO NOT MOST FOR SPIKE IT DOES NOT- BUILDING. IT'S REALLY INTO HAT A FRAMEWORK AND- DRUG THE EXISTING. PIECES. YOUR QUESTION S. OF AND I REALIZE THAT THAT AND AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO DO I GUESS THE ARE USED SECURITIES AND HOPEFULLY YOU GET OUT WORK THERE. HASSOCKS STAND BUT IS THERE. THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT CONNECTING AND ONE OF THE THERE'S CERTAIN MINIMUM LEVEL SECURITY TO ENSURE THAT SOMEONE NOW I CAN ACCESS ONE NETWORK NOW ACTUALLY ACCESS EVERYBODY RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE CONNECTING ALL THESE NETWORKS TOGETHER. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THAT THE EFFORTS IN TERMS OF BOTH THE GOVERNANCE OF THIS OF. THIS WORK THAT WERE. YOU GOTTA BE RECOMMENDING. DIEM PLACE AND THAT'S PARKS SO FAR. AS WELL AS GREATEST A- AS WELL AS THE STANDARD ARE GONNA BE RECOMMENDING ALL SIX. SO IT'S GETTING EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE IT'S ALIGNING WITH TAPPED. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AS WELL. THEN I GUESS THE PUBLIC CUTS FOR AS PAUL PROTECT AS WELL AS THERE'S ONE OTHER I DON'T I'M MISSING MANY- QUICK JUST- THE CONSUMER- PROTECTION PRINCIPLE FOR ALL INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND PLANET HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH X. BETTER AT TO ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THAT'S AND THAT'S WHERE WHERE WE'RE HEADED WITH SO MANY OF THE FRIENDS IS I WAS MOVING TOWARDS. MOVING TO OUR PERSONS APPROACH AND HAVING DAY IN THE RIGHT BUT WE NEED IT WERE LEVERAGED BY SOME. FOR A LOCAL LAW AS WELL AS. ALL RIGHT WELL I LOOK. TO WE TALK PUBLIC THAT WE HAVE THE KIND INVESTMENT NESTOR TO HAVE. PUBLIC HEALTH TAKE IT. OF OUR TO THESE THIS NETWORK OF NETWORKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE NETWORK OF NETWORK TALK TO OTHER AND HAVE THE TO BE ABLE THOSE. THROUGH THE THROUGH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION- DISTANT NETWORK TALK- OKAY SOCIAL WE HEAR NOW FROM THE L. A. O.

MONEY GOING OUT- I KEEP LOOKING I SHOULD LOOK AT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY GOING OUT REPEATEDLY FOR THE NEW CONSTRUCTION THE UPGRADE THAT BUILDING. A FOR NEW FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR DEMAND- DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR LIKE WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GO WITH THE PLANS AND THEN WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT A BACK UP AND HOW LONG IT TAKES. IS YOUR DEPARTMENT AGENCY BEEN ABLE TO REALLY WORK TO EXPEDITE- THE NEW CONSTRUCTION TO THE REHABILITATION TO BE ABLE TO GET AS MANY. FACILITIES. UP AND RUNNING AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO WANT YOUR ABOUT. BUILDING CURRENT. YES SO THERE ARE RIGHT OF MILESTONES- IN TERMS OF SEISMIC CONSTRUCTION. SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS ON THE NUMBER OF DEADLINES THAT HAD TO BE MET BY TWENTY TWENTY AND THERE ARE SOME EXTENSIONS AND ANOTHER SET OF. REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MET BY TWENTY THIRTY SO- I'VE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH OUR TEAM AND THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH THEY TAKE IN WORKING WITH FACILITIES TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE A VERY PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH- AND WORKING WITH HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME CHALLENGES AND CO THAT HAS SLOWED- SOME OF OUR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS BUT THEY'RE MOVING ALONG AND AGAIN WE WORK WITH WITH EACH FACILITY TO TRY TO MEET THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. I GUESS I GUESS I'M SPEAK MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SOME OF THE- REAL HEALTH. WHICH WOULD GO THROUGH SOME ACUTE CARE AND SOME MORE SKILLED. FACILITY TYPE. PROGRAM SO ARE YOU ALSO. RE CENTERING YOUR WORK ON SOME OF THAT PRIORITY THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW YEAH I'M HAPPY TO HAVE IT IF CARL SHERMAN OR OR CHRIS JOKE IS FUNDS TO HELP JUMP IN SPECIFICALLY ON SOME OF OUR WORK ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITIES- WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT MADAM CHAIR AND OR TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. CARLA CHRIS ARE YOU ABLE TO. CALL YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT. YES SIR THANK YOU ARE MADAM DIRECTOR AND- MADAM CHAIR- AS- AS THE ORGANIZATION CHANGES FROM ARCH PART TWO H. CHI THE EMPHASIS ON ACCESS TO CARE IS BEING APPLIED TO THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE OTHER TWO AGENTS WITH IN H. CHI WE'RE LOOKING NOW AT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE BOTH IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN DELIVER. THE- THE PLAN REVIEW AND CONSTRUCTION OBSERVATION IN A MORE CUSTOMER CENTRIC MANNER BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME HOW WE CAN WORK WITH OUR CLIENTS THAT IN ADVANCE OF THEM BRINGING IN THEIR PROJECTS TO ENSURE THAT WHAT THEY BRING TO US IS SOMETHING THAT'S CAPABLE OF MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS MORE SMOOTHLY. SO WITH THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF THAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO DO. AT THE RICH. LIKE DID YOU USE THAT THE TERM CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE- NEVER FORGET I WAS AMAZED AND I WAS IN THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING YOU SAW TALK TALK ABOUT THAT AS A PRIORITY. AND A LOT OF EMPLOYEES SEEM SURPRISED BY THAT BUT YES THE PUBLIC IS OUR BIGGEST- CONSTITUENT AND WHO WE NEED TO BE SERVING. SO I BY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS. AND WILL CERTAINLY BE FOLLOWING UP ON THIS. CONSISTENTLY BECAUSE AS WE ALL KEEP TELLING EVERYBODY THAT THERE'S THERE ARE THINGS COMING IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO HEAR FROM. OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT THEY THAT THEY CONTINUE TO WAIT ON THE STATE. BUDGET PLAN. THANK YOU AND AGAIN REPEAT THE OVERVIEW FROM THE DIRECTOR- GIVEN THE FACT THAT EACH GUY FORMALLY OSHKOSH YOU OF THE WORK FORCE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY THE SAME WAY THAT- CHAIR EGGMAN TALKED ABOUT ON THE FACILITY SIDE. AND WE'RE ALSO COLLECTING A LOT OF DATA ON SERVICE THE PAYMENT SIDE. AS WELL- ARE WE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT SO FOR EXAMPLE THE WORK FORCE SIDE YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIG FOCUS ON PIPELINE RIGHT HOW MANY PROGRAM HOW WE TRAIN PROGRAMS TRAINING POSITIONS YOU KNOW THAT CENTER. ARE WE ALSO LOOKING. ON THE PAYMENT SIDE SO THE PAYMENTS SUFFICIENT TO RETAIN PEOPLE IN THIS FIELD SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S JUST TAKE NURSING FACILITIES I THINK WE HAVE SOME PROGRAMS TO GET MORE CNA'S INTO NURSING. HOMES BUT- WE ALSO KNOW PEOPLE LEAVE THE FIELD IT'S A DOUBTS LOCATES VERY TOUGH IT'S ADDRESS. AND TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO FOR NOT YOU KNOW- TERMS OF LOOKING AT WELL I MEAN WE CAN FEED MORE PEOPLE THE PIPELINE THAT PEOPLE ARE LEAKING OUT THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE THE WORKING CONDITIONS ARE GREAT. THE PAYS TOO LOW IT'S OUR- THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH UP AND THEN ALSO TO ADVISE OTHER DEPARTMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE MEDIC HOUSE MAJOR PAYER FOR NURSING FACILITY OFFERS NURSING FACILITIES. EIGHTY THERE YOU KNOW THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO PAY PEOPLE AT THE LEVEL THAT WILL HELP RETAIN THEM. THOSE ARE THE- DOES EACH KIND OF LOOK THE HOUSE IS CONSIDERING THOSE TYPES OF ANALYSES AS WELL SO IT'S CERTAINLY IT'S GREAT TO FOCUS ON PIPELINE ON WORKFORCE BUT THIS ALSO RETENTION. YOU KNOW YOU I KNOW THAT THEIR LIFE PHYSICIANS PLAN TO RETIRE. IT HAD IT SO YOU KNOW WE COULD LOSE A LOT OF OUR WORK FORCE THAT AY TOO AND IT AND I THINK THERE'S OTHER OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WELL NURSING I'VE BEEN HEARING THAT AS WELL. SO IS THERE ARE STILL ORDERS TIED THOSE TYPES OF ANALYSES- BEING CONSIDERED BY. EACH TIME WHEN IT LOOKS AT WORK FORCE. ABSOLUTELY CENTER PANS SO FAR OF THE RE. DATA CENTER AND- THE BUDGET. THERE WAS. IN A ONE THIRD THREE LEFT YEAR INCLUDES. AS AS I NOTED. INCREASED DATA FROM THE LICENSING BOARD SO WE NEED TO. HAVE BETTER SUPPLY SIDE DATA A DEMAND DATA. SO WE- GOT THAT MATT MEDICAL BOARD IS DONE THE BEST OF THE SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN- HEALING ARTS LICENSING BOARDS BUT THERE WILL BE A- A STANDARD SET OF. DATA THAT'S COLLECTED WHICH DOES INCLUDE RETIREMENT PLANS- CLINICAL HOURS BECAUSE WE NEED TO NOT JUST LOOK AT HOW MANY. PROVIDERS WE HAVE IN THE VARIOUS AREAS BUT WHAT THE RETIREMENT PLANS ARE WHAT WHERE THEY PRACTICING. SO WE ARE TRYING TO LOOK HOLISTICALLY. AT RECRUITMENT. HIRING RETENTION AND ADVANCEMENT RIGHT SO I THINK A LOT OF THE TALK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS- IN ADDITION TO HOW DO WE HAVE BY PLAN PROGRAMS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS IS HOW DO WE- PROVIDE ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO PROMOTE WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE.

ALL BASICALLY WE ARE TRYING TO WORK- ON EVERY HEALTHCARE CLASSIFICATION- FROM PEER SUPPORT WORKERS ALL THE WAY UP TO DOCTORS AND PSYCHIATRISTS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE NEED IS SO GREAT. I HAVE A PRE SHEET THAT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT FOR EXAMPLE- STUDY WAS DONE SHOULD PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ONLY SPENT 28% 28% OF THEIR TIME DOING CLINICAL WORK THE REST OF THE TIME WAS DOING ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD. DO WE WANT TO DOUBLE OUR PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE IF WE COULD JUST HAVE PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS BE ALLOWED TO SPEND 50% JUST HALF THEIR TIME DOING CLINICAL WORK WE COULD ALMOST DOUBLE OR PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE. SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THIS OVERHEAD PROBLEM TOO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

WE PLAN TO LAUNCH NEW EARNING LEARN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN LATE SUMMER OR FALL. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND WE'RE MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO BUILD A WORKFORCE THAT EFFECTIVELY SERVES SYSTEM AND JUSTICE INVOLVED HERE. I CAN RELATE TO THE OTHER INVESTMENTS I AGE I RECEIVED AROUND WORKFORCE- THIS LAST AS PER YEAR. WE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING FUNDING FOR SONG BROWN WE RECEIVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SONG BROWN- FUNDING TO SUPPORT PRIMARY CARE NEW PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. WE ARE IN DEVELOPING THE PLANS FOR AUGMENTING OUR EXISTING SONG BROWN PROGRAM WITH THIS NEW FINDING THEM ALL OPEN THE GRANT CYCLE IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ALSO RECEIVED- TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND SONG BROWN NURSING PRE LICENSURE ARE IN PROGRAMS- WE JUST COMPLETED THE APPLICATION CYCLE FOR THIS PROGRAM AND WILL BE AWARDING TWENTY THREE PROGRAMS OVER NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN AWARDS- WE ALSO RECEIVED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE SERVING OLDER ADULTS. USING OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS WE HAVE ALREADY AWARDED OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION IN FUNDING TO PROVIDERS SERVING OLDER ADULTS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS A STEVEN THEM THOMPSON PHYSICIAN CORP ON REPAYMENT PROGRAM. AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR REPAYMENT PROGRAM. WE WILL ALSO USE THESE FUNDS TO AUGMENT OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS OUR HEALTH CAREERS EXPLORATION PROGRAM. AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TALKING ABOUT THE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT WORKFORCE WE RECEIVED- FUNDING TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS BUILDING THE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT WORKFORCE. WE HAVE AWARDED A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT TO AN ORGANIZATION EMPOWERED AGING. AMPLE IMPLEMENTED ACNA HOUSE CAREER PATHWAY PROGRAM. WE ARE WORKING WITH A CONSULTANT WHO HAS COMPLETED STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH AND A NEEDS ASSESSMENT LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS AND OBSTACLES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUILDING THE CNA WORKFORCE WE'RE BEGINNING PRIORITIZATION AND DESIGN WORK NOW TO DETERMINE HOW TO BEST BUILT AND SUPPORT THIS WORKFORCE. WE EXPECT TO OPEN YOUR FUNDING CYCLES IN A WAR JUST ONE PROGRAMS- IN THIS YEAR. AND THEN FINALLY AROUND THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM WE RECEIVED SIXTEEN MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDING THAT ALLOWS US TO ORGANIZE AND BUILD HEALTH WORKFORCE PROGRAMS UNDER THE- H. PCAOB PORTFOLIO. WE ARE DEVELOPING PLANS FOR A NEW PIPELINE PROGRAM AND WILL OPEN IN FUNDING CYCLE OF THE MID TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE ARE ALSO AUGMENTING OUR HEALTH CAREERS EXPLORATION PROGRAM FORMALLY KNOWN AS ARE MANY PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CAREER EXPLORATION GRANTS. WE ALSO RECEIVED FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SCHOLARS PROGRAM WE'RE EXECUTING THIS GRANT AGREEMENT WITH THE MANAGING ENERGY WILL CONDUCT THIS PROGRAM- HAVE BEEN TAKEN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY SOCIAL WORKER. MANY RANGE OF SOCIAL WORK PROFESSIONS- MASTER SOCIAL WORK- BSW MSW THE SOCIAL WORK POFESSION OKAY LICENSE CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE CASE I GUESS YOU KNOW WHICH IS ONE OF MY PET PEEVES THAT WE DON'T HAVE. PROTECTION AROUND THAT TITLE SO WHEN WE SAY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SOCIAL WORKERS THERE ARE. COUNTY PROGRAMS ARE ALL KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND HIRE PEOPLE AS SOCIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN. IN A CLASSROOM FOR A PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORK SO MAYBE. MAYBE THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE CAN MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THAT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN. ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL WORKERS AND IT IS IT IS A- PROFESSION. THAT THEN WE SHOULD ACTUALLY HIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECEIVED DEGREES IN THAT PROFESSION- AND ALONG THAT LINE I THINK I JUST DESPICABLE. SO I THINK B. S. W.'S ARE ARE FINE PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE COACHES IN AN ENTRY LEVEL PEOPLE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. WORKING TOGETHER WITH SYSTEMS IN OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS- COMING FROM A DIVISION OF SOCIAL WORKER OR SOCIAL WORK WHERE WE USED TO HAVE. OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MSW STUDENTS AND A VERY SMALL BSW PROGRAM. THAT HAS NOW FLIPPED. WE HAVE VIRTUALLY INCREDIBLY SMALL MSW PROGRAM AND A VERY BIG BSW PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE TO. HAVE A- BSW PROGRAM THAN AN MSW PROGRAM BUT THAT PUT THE QUEUE TO IMPACT THAN ON OUR SYSTEM SO WHEN WE SAY WE HAVE TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT AT SCHOOLS OFTENTIMES. IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND MAKE THE BUDGET WE DO THAT WITH THE- THE LESS EXPENSIVE PROGRAM WHICH IS NOT MEETING OUR NEEDS SO I WOULD JUST BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING THAT. THAT WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT FUNDING THE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE GET A BSW. THEN THEY GO TO- AND PROGRAMS MOST IN THE WORLD. AND GET AN MSW THAT PERHAPS. WE WOULD LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO JUST SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT. WHEN WE USE LANGUAGE LIKE THAT AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT IT IS A PET PEEVE OF MINE THAT. WE USE THAT WORD WITHOUT REALLY. MEANING OF THAT WORD. I'M SO THIS MIGHT BE A VERY GOOD TIME TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT IT IS A WELL TRAINED AND EFFECTIVE. WORK FORCE AND NOT JUST BODIES FILLING UP SLOTS- BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I THINK HOW WE BURN PEOPLEOUT. VERY QUICKLY- I WILL START PRINTING AND DOCTOR PAN HASN'T. THANK YOU AND- AGAIN- PRECEDE THE PRESENTATION I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- SO AND I KNOW THAT- IN THE PAST TO PASS A LITTLE BIT AOUT THE HEALTH COACHES AND COUNSELORS AND- IN TERMS OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR- ACTUAL ROLE WILL BE N. SO RECOGNIZED IT. SO JUST BE SURE THAT- WE KNOW WHAT THEIR ACTUAL ROLES IS GOING TO BE IN JAIL GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEIR- NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE FAIRLY LIMITED TRAINING- YOU KNOW THE TERMS WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO. BUT THEN THE ALSO THE OTHER PART IS- IN TERMS OF EXPANDING TRAINING FOR PSYCHIATRY AND SOCIAL WORKERS- THAT ALL MIXED UP IN ONE LINE AND- SO SOCIAL WORKERS AT THEIR OWN PARTY SINCE I CHARACTERS HAVE THEIR OWN EXPERTISE SO WE MIGHT WANT TO PARSE OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF THIS IS. A PSYCHO CUT PSYCHIATRY AND THAT'S FOR SOCIAL WORKERS SO INSTEAD OF JUST SERVE BLENDING IT ALL TOGETHER ONE ONE ONE SOME SOFA SO MIGHT BE TO BREAK THAT OUT MORE SPECIFICALLY. IN THE- UPDATE. THE CENTERPIECE LOS. OF THE REAL HEALTH COACHES. ON THE THIS. OF THE- ARE UNDER- WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN SOME- GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH EDUCATION PARTNERS SO KAREN I'VE SPENT. MANY HOURS OVER THE LAST MONTH LEARNING MORE ABOUT- EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL AND WHAT HOW THIS WORK FORCE MIGHT BE MOST HELPFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS ABLE TO. PRACTICE AT THE TOP OF THEIR LICENSE ARE AT THE TOP OF THEIR- AREA OF EXPERTISE WE'RE ALSO VERY COMMITTED TO ENGAGING IN A CO DESIGN PROCESS WITH YOU FROM CELLS. AND SO WE DO PLAN TO SPEND THE NEXT FEW MONTHS REALLY TRYING TO GET THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH ROLE RIGHT SO. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A- YOU. ARE THAT WAY WHAT THE EXACT WILL WILL BE BUT WE HAVE BEEN- BUSILY ENGAGED. IN LOOKING MODELS AND- WITH STATE CALL. AND ALL I'LL LET CARE. ED PLEASE PLEASE THAT YES WE DO HAVE POTS OF MONEY ON ON PSYCHIATRY AND SOCIAL WORKERS. THERE'S A PROPOSED MANY JESSICA I KNOW HER DAD OKAY I WAS SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE WILL FOLLOW UP ON THAT JUST YET WE DO HAVE SEPARATE PROGRAMS FOR THAT WE HAVE AN EXISTING PROGRAM FOR- EXPANDING TRAINING AROUND PSYCHIATRY. OKAY I'M AND THEN WE'RE DEVELOPING A NEW PROGRAM AROUND BUILDING CAPACITY TO TRAIN US SOCIAL WORKERS OKAY SO YOU'LL GET BACK IN TERMS OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH GOES IN EACH. OKAY AND- I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THE LICENSE BUT WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT SKILLS AND WHAT IS THE TOPIC LICENSE PLATES THE MEANS SO- I THINK WITH A- LITTLE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT. USING THAT TIME TERMINOLOGY. BUT YEAH AND DID PRECIADO ANY BACK- IN THE END WE DON'T YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO. EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SHORTAGE IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY WELL IN THE SHORTAGE. SOMETHING'S BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT THAT DOES THAT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN SOMETHING IS. BE THE BEST OR EVEN GOOD RIGHT SO- AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A HUGE DEMAND AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE MAN BEFORE. YOU KNOW YOU TRY TO STRETCH THE PEOPLE WE HAVE BUT AT SOME POINT TIME YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT- JUST BECAUSE THEY SAW SOMEBODY. DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT SOMEBODY HAS THE CAPACITY OR THE SKILLS OR TRAINING. TO DELIVER THE KIND OF CARE THAT WOULD BE BEST FOR THAT PERSON. AND MAYBE BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT TAT'S STILL YOU KNOW INSPECTION WE START TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHO FALLS INTO THAT CAMP RATE SO IT'S USUALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE DISADVANTAGED TO GET. THAT CETERA WHO END UP FINDING THEMSELVES THE SHORTS HANDSTAND STICKS OH NO YOU GOT TAKEN CARE OF. HE SAID YOU GOT TO SEE SOMEBODY. DIED WE GET IT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO THE APPROPRIATELY TRAINED PERSON. NOT JUST ANYBODY AND- I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE ATTENTION IS. AND CERTAINLY I THINK THERE IS A PLACE IN A ROLE FOR THESE COACHES AND COUNSELORS. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE AND THAT IS MENTAL HEALTH IS COMPLEX IT'S NOT EASY TAKE CARE OF. SKY CONDITION AND SO- WE NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH QUALIFIED PEOPLE. ARE AVAILABLE TO TAKE CARE OF. OFTENTIMES COMPLEX SITUATIONS. IN A MINUTE I WANTED IT ALL DEPENDED AND PUT TENSION ON ON BOTH SIDES BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE ALL. WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE THAT. THAT VERY EDUCATED IN AND PREPARED WORK FORCE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE. A PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF LIFE EXPERIENCE OUT THERE AS WELL AND SO AND THEN I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN OUT PROGRAMS AND SING. GREAT EXAMPLES OF PROMOTE TORTOISE AND NAVIGATORS AND ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT SO THAT IS PART OF THE FULL CONTINUUM AND I THINK. I THINK THE EXCITING THING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. IS WE ARE NOT JUST LOOKING AT ONE PART OR ANOTHER POT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. AS IT RELATES TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WE KNOW THAT THE SOONER WE GET PEOPLE AND IF THEY'RE YOUNG. THAT SOONER THAN LATER. THERE ARE FEWER PROBLEMS THAN LATER THAT IMPACT. IMPACT THE END OF OUR HEALTH. FOR OUR- HEALTH SPECTRUMS. WE DO WE DO APPRECIATE. YOUR ATTENTION TO THE- THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE AS WE TALK ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. FAMILY AND WE APPRECIATE THAT ATTENTION. OKAY- THE BELIAU. THANK U. S. SENATOR EGGMAN A KOREAN SHEET WITH THE L.

THIS IS A LOT OF BIG CHUNKS LET'S. STOP HERE- AND SEE IF WE HAVE ANY AND A DOCTOR PAN HAD EARLIER BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO SOME OF THE OTHER ONES. AND I GUESS MY FIRST. QUESTION A COMMENT- MYSTERE EXAM. IS ABOUT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT- JUST MAKING SURE. ALL OF ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS LIKE THE PURE PERSONAL TRAINING AND PLACEMENT PROGRAMS ALL OF THOSE THAT WE DON'T LOSE TRACK OF ALL THOSE AS WELL AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONTINUE TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE- WE'RE NOT WORKING IN SILOS WHERE WE TRAIN PEOPLE OVER HERE AND THEN THEY CAN'T GET A JOB IN ANOTHER PART OF. IT AND- SURE THAT. EVERYBODY WERE TRAINING WE'RE DOING OUR VERY BEST- TO MAINTAIN AND MOVE UP THROUGH THE SYSTEM. AND THEN I GUESS AND THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE I WOULD JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIS. WHEN WE'RE BUILDING THESE SYSTEMS ARE MORE TRAINING NEW PEOPLE SUPERVISION IS UP UP MOST IMPORTANT SO YOU NEED THOSE AT THE HIGHER END OF THEIR- THEIR DEGREES INNER AND THEIR AND THEIR EXPERTISE TO BE APPROVED BY THE SUPERVISION. ON THE GROUND IT IN ALL OF THE SETTINGS. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE FULL CLINICAL EXPERIENCE THAT THEY NEED. TWO METERS AND ARE WE DOING THAT I WOULD MAKING SURE THESE PEOPLE STAY. I WOULD. LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND DEFER THAT QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE KAREN WHO IS MORE OF THE PROGRAM EXPERT ON THE SIDE KAREN. WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT AS WE DEVELOP. PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT CAREER LADDERS- WHEN HE GETS IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT WE WANT TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN- M. BUILDING PATHWAYS FOR PROFESSIONAL SO THAT WE ARE CONNECTING. THE PROGRAM AND- BUILDING CAREER LADDERS FOR OUR HEALTH WORKFORCE. AND I LIKE THAT AND I TELL EVERYBODY THAT WE'RE I'M I'M OUT IN THE COMMUNITY I THAT THAT'S WHAT I TELL PEOPLE THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE BUILDING THAT LATTER ARE WE DOING IT WILL GET THE WRONGS HONORED. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ARE REALLY TAKING A FOCUSED LOOK AT THIS TIME YES HOW DO WE BUILD AS WE'RE BUILDING NEW PROGRAMS. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING FOR THE PAST AS WELL ENTER INTO THEIR- WHOLE CAREERS AND HOW HOW THEY CAN ADVANCE AND BE RETAINED WITHIN. THE HEALTH WORKFORCE. OKAY COME BACK AND SHOW ME THE LETTER AND ALL THE WRONGS. SOON. YES HOPING THAT FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE- CERTAINLY OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU DR DEPEND. I WOULD JUST ECHO. SENATE ADMINS ALSO SAID NO AND INTENDED IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE QUESTION I ORIGINALLY ASKED THE DIRECTOR IS THAT OBVIOUSLY OPIUM FOCUS ON PIPELINE BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE RETENTION PIECE. AND THE WORK ENVIRONMENT WHICH THEY'RE IN RIGHT SO FOR YOU KNOW THIS AGENCY H. GUYS ALSO GOING TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE PAYMENTS AND BUDGET DOWN AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO ARE WE CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PAID IN A WAY AND ARE TO THE WORK ENVIRONMENT ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF HASSLES. IS IT GOING TO BE A WORK OF ART SUPPORT OF THEM DOING THE KIND OF WORK WHERE SHE WANTED TO DO RIGHT PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS ACTUAL PROVIDE CLINICAL CARE NOT TO ADMINISTRATIVE WORK WE MIGHT BE ABLE HEALTH WORKERS TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE NOT PAPERWORK RIGHTS SO- SO THAT THAT'S PART OF ALL PLEA WHAT WE'RE DOING ANY ERA AND THEN I THINK IT'S THIS IS THE PREGNANT UPSETS IS. TWENTY ARE. ONCE I USED TO WRITE. THE PROGRAM WE HAVE TO BE THEY'RE BEING. SO AND ALL WE HAVE APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES IN FROM WHAT THEY CAN DO AFTER GROW. THAT WE DON'T. SIMPLY PUT IN SUCH. WHERE AND- IN OVER THEIR HEADS- SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE EXPECT THEM TO DELIVER MORE THAN THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER- BECAUSE WE COULD HAVE A SHORTAGE AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE. IT'S AROUND. SO THAT'S THAT THAT LEADS TO BOTH BURNED OUT ON THE PROFESSIONAL SIDE BUT ALSO LEADS TO YOU KNOW CHALLENGES AND IN DOWN BALLOT EQUITY AND- ACCESS AND SO FORTH FOR. FOR THE PATIENTS ARE BEING SEEN AS WELL SO- BUT LET BIG ISSUES- BUT- WITH H. K. HAVING. SO PIECES THEN SERVE SURROUNDING ALL THESE THING. HOPEFULLY YOU THE AGENCY FORMER YOUR POWER NOT ONLY THE WORK FOR. BUT ALSO ON THE- ON THE PAYMENT SIDE AS WELL AS YOUR BUSINESS AGENCIES CAN BE MORE ENGAGED IN. AND THAT. WE ARE EAGER TO WITNESS YOUR PROGRESS. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR WORK. OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON THEN WITH- NUMBER SEVEN. RIGHT BACK TO WORK FORCE. WONDERFUL AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD SEGUE- MANAGER DR PANDA TALKING ABOUT THOUGH THE LARGE WORKFORCE PROPOSAL ON THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SO JUST IN pHEALTHCARE CRISIS THAT CALIFORNIA'S FACING THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY CAME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARICOM THE WORK FORCE. THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES ONE POINT ONE BILLION OVER THREE YEARS TO RECRUIT TRAIN HIRE AND AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALSO ADVANCE UNETHICALLY AND CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE WITH IMPROVE DIVERSITY- AND COMPENSATION OF COURSE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF ALL OF THIS. TO KELLY JEFF AND THE LABOR AGENCY CAME TOGETHER TO RESPOND TO THE WORKFORCE CRISIS I MEAN I THINK WE'RE ALL HEARING IT EVERY DAY THAT HOSPITALS ARE SHORT STAFFED AND DESPERATE PAYING VERY HIGH REGISTRY RATES FOR THE TEMPORARY WORK FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WERE HEARING IT FROM- WE COULD GO ON OR NOT BUT I THINK THERE'S A REAL RECOGNITION ABOUT THE SHORT SUPPLY AND ALSO THE- OF A- TOOK TO DIVERSIFY THE CURRENT WORKS. THE RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGES SPOKEN LGBTQ STATUS AS. WELL AS PEOPLE OF LIVED EXPERIENCE. THE H. COMPONENTS IN THE FORCE HELPING THREE YEARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN A PORTION OF THE OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS TO INVEST IN TRAINING A DIVERSE HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE. TO ADDRESS HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGES IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE INCLUDING FOR MEDICAL MEMBERS SO AGAIN I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THE BRIEFLY AND THEN SEE WHAT WHAT FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS YOU HAVE- THERE IS A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER INITIATIVE. OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO RECRUIT TRAIN AND CERTIFY A NEW VICIOUS GOAL OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO AGAIN THIS IS. SENATOR EGGMAN AND I HAD THIS CONVERSATION THIS IS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS FROM A THOUGHT AS PEOPLE WITH PEER SUPPORT FOLKS PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER- AND WE KNOW THIS IS A- MAN ON A MEDIC CAL BENEFITS- HOPEFULLY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL GET FINAL APPROVAL ON. THIS SUMMER- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT SPECIALTY CERTIFICATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING CLIMATE HEALTH. UNLESS S. AND DEMENTIA. AGAIN WRECKING THERE'S A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NURSING INITIATIVE. OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR ENDS L. B. AND C. N. A.'S CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES AND IN KEEPING WITH SB SIXTY FIVE- CERTIFIED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONERS. AND WE HOPE TO UTILIZE- SEVERAL OF OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS CHECK FOR THAT SUPPORT- AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED A VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TRAINING- HELPING FOLKS GET THEIR MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK SO WE DO HAVE A CALIFORNIA SOCIAL WORK TWENTY THIRTY INITIATIVE. TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION TO SUPPORT SOCIAL WORK TRAINING PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE STIPENDS AND SCHOLARSHIPS. FOR PEOPLE TO CREATE A NEW PIPELINES. SOCIAL WORKERS WE'VE HAD SOME ENCOURAGING INITIAL CONVERSATIONS- WITH SOME OF THE PROGRAM WENT WITH CAL SWAG- ABOUT THE IDEA OF A FOUR PLUS ONE. AND ACCELERATED MASTER'S IN SOCIAL FROM. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. TWENTY MILLION TO CREATE TRAINING POSITIONS FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS PSYCHOLOGY INTERNS AND FELLOWS AND PSYCHIATRIC NURSES SO WE'RE LOOKING TO INCREASE ON SITE TRAINING PROGRAMS TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE WHILE ALSO SERVING AS AN ACTIVE RECRUITMENT TOOL FOR ADVANCEMENT WITHIN THAT THE HHS WORK FORCE LEADING TO A PROMOTIONAL PATHWAYS AND INCREASED SALARIES WILL HELP THEM INITIATIVE SIXTY MILLION IN GENERAL FUD TO EXPAND SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS AND HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL WORK SPECIFICALLY FOR MULTI LINGUAL APPLICANTS SO ALL WHILE ALL OF OUR EACH CARRY ON WORKFORCE PROGRAMS SEEK TO INCREASE. RACIAL LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY- WE DID THINK IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SPECIFIC INITIATIVE FOCUSED ON- ON INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MULTI LINGUAL PROVIDERS AND THAT WITH THE PEOPLE OF INCREASING LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS TREATMENT THERE IS A PROPOSAL FOR SHE USED TWENTY SIX MILLION TO TRAIN PROVIDERS TO BUILD OUT THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE WITH A FOCUS ON OPIOID TREATMENT HOUSING WILL BE USED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LICENSE CONDITIONS. INCLUDING PROVIDERS FOCUSED ON ON ADDICTION FUNDING WILL ALSO PROVIDE SUPPORT OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES TO PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ISSUES TO TRANSITION THEM INTO ONGOING- CONFINEMENT. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT ITEM. THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- FREESHEET- THE INVESTMENT AND- THE WORK FORCE AND I WOULD MAKE NOTES- AND BACKGROUND MATERIAL. THAT THERE'S A FORECASTED REDUCTIONS IN. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE ENTERING IN AS PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS- THEN THE ONES ARE PROJECTED RETIRE. AND SO I THINK- WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT SO WE DO HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE SONG BROWN AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK. THERE'S AN ISSUE THERE AND I THINK WE NEED TO RECONSIDER SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT THE VALUE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY. THE SIGNALS AND SET AND- MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE PAYING ATTENTION. AND WE NEED TO REVERSE THOSE IF YOU WANT TO- BRING BACK PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO CALIFORNIA. SO HOPEFULLY WE WILL- THINK ABOUT CONSIDER THAT BUT WE ALSO WANT THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO BOLSTER THAT THAT WORKFORCE- THE OTHER. ISSUE ALSO CITING AND KNOWS THAT IN THE CATEGORY PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS- RESIDENCIES ARE. FOR PHYSICIANS. SO MAYBE IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO CLASSIFY THESE AS POSTGRADUATE ARE- TRAINING OR WHATEVER SO- CERTAINLY THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHIATRISTS NURSES. BUT IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING WHEN THE TERM WHEN THE TITLE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS AND WE'RE MIXING AGAIN MIXING UP DIFFERENT TYPES OF. PEOPLE IN THAT CATEGORY SO IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO ACTUALLY BREAK OUT. HOW MUCH OF THE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO SPECIFICALLY WHAT- WHICH PARTICULAR PROFESSIONALS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND DIFFERENT PLACES. YEAH I KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT. EXACTLY HI I SURE I SURE OF WHAT EXACTLY SAID SO TO BE HELPFUL TO BREAK SOME OF THAT OUT BECAUSE THIS IS A PRETTY CERVANTES ONCE THAT THE NEXT PROFESSIONALS. AND I THINK- PER THAT AGAIN WE SHOULD PROBABLY. SORT OUT WHICH ONES WE NEED AND HOW MANY WE NEED OF. OF THEM PRESENT DIFFERENT ROLES- I'D I'D ACTUALLY IS A POSITION I DON'T THE I DON'T. KNOW PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT THINGS AND I CAN'T REPLACE THE COLLEGES AND PSYCHOLOGISTS DOESN'T REPLACE ME SO. WE JUST NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENT ROLES- PEOPLE PLAY- IN IN IN THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORLD- SO- BUT- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ABOUT THE DECLINING- NUMBERS OF FIVE. I AM A CARE PHYSICIANS BEING PROJECTED TO BY THE WAY. ALSO ARE ON THE FRONTLINES OF PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AS WELL- SO IF FOR A- AND OFTENTIMES FOR MILD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE DIAGNOSIS AND EVEN THE TREATMENT. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND I'LL GET CARE RESOLUTIONS TO JUMP IN AS WELL BUT JUST AT THE OUTSET YOU KNOW WE WERE VERY PLEASED TO GET THE FIFTY MILLION. DOLLAR AUGMENTATION FOR SONG BROWN- LAST YEAR AND PLAN TO PUT THOSE DOLLARS TO GOOD USE TO TRY TO EXPAND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE WORK OF THE NEW WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL. WE'LL BE VERY FOCUSED WE- USE THE WORK OF THE FUTURE WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT- IS AS AS A VERY IMPORTANT DIED OF OURS AND SO WERE WE YES WE'RE AWARE. OF THE ISSUE AND TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR PROGRAMS TO TRY TO SUPPORT THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. CARE IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD. I WOULD PROBABLY JUST SAY THERE'S OTHER DOCUMENTS I'D LOOK TO NOT JUST THE COMMISSION REPORT WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO ACTUALLY PUBLISHED PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS- SO- AND AGAIN RECOGNIZING THEIR ROLE AND BRIAN WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND CLEAN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. HEALTH CARE BUT- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONTINUING DEVALUATION OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SIGNAL THAT SENDS AND THAT'S YOU KNOW SOME OF IT IS. WE CAN FIND MORE PROGRAMS BUT- THAT THE AS THE- HEALTH WORKFORCE CENTER. SAYS THAT THERE'S INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS. ENTERING SO YOU KNOW WHY IS THAT. AND WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING THAT'S ACTUALLY DISCOURAGING. AS ACTUALLY MORE MEDICAL STUDENTS AND NEVER ACTUALLY. FOR INCREASING NUMBER MEDICAL STUDENTS OUT THERE BUT YET THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PRIMARY CARE WHY IS IT. AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF POLICIES THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO PLACE ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES PRIMARY. THESE MEDICAL SINCE METRIC PRIMARY CARE. PARTICULARLY WHAT A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE AS WELL SO- SO THAT I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SHOULD YOU WANT TO GO NOW YOUR HANDS UP DID YOU WANT TO GO NOW DO YOU WANT TO WAIT TO THE WORK DONE WITH THESE- IF IT'S OKAY MANAGER- ELLIE- HAD JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THIS SPECIFIC ITEM IF IT'S- SURE. THANK YOU- SO FIRST- WE JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE L. A. O. IS PLANNING TO RELEASE AN ANALYSIS IN THE COMING WEEKS OF THIS H. CHI PROPOSAL AND THE OTHER PROPOSALS- IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE TOGETHER PACKAGE BY THE ADMINISTRATION AS THE CARE ECONOMY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE- YOU KNOW BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE WE ARE READY TO MAKE A FEW PRELIMINARY COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL- WE GENERALLY FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY AT A VERY CONCEPTUAL STAGE AND SHE DETAILS WILL NEED TO BE FLUSHED OUT DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THAT YOU GENERALLY A SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS EXIST ESPECIALLY ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS- AND THIS PROPOSAL MAY HELP TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE SHORTAGES YEAH WE GENERALLY FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BENEFIT FROM A CLEAR PROBLEM DEFINITION OF WHAT THE SPECIFIC WORKFORCE GAPS IT AIMS TO ADDRESS OUR- THIS COULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE DEVELOPING A TARGET NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO BE ADDED AND CLEARLY COMMUNICATING HOW CLOSE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD GET US TO THAT TARGET SORT OF ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF PROVIDERS- THIS WOULD ALSO SORT OF HELP THE LEGISLATURE ASSESS WHETHER THIS SPECIFIC SET OF PROVIDERS. ARE THE IDEAL ONES TO TARGET IN THIS PROPOSAL- THE SECOND COMMENT WE WOULD MAKE IS THAT IT'S CURRENTLY UNCLEAR AT THIS PROPOSAL WILL RELY SOLELY ON EXISTING H. CHI WORKFORCE PROGRAMS OR IF IT WOULD REQUIRE THE CREATION OF ENTIRELY NEW PROGRAMS IN H. CHI- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT IT CURRENTLY PLANS TO PROVIDE THIS FUNDING THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND WILL ASSESS AT A LATER DATE WHETHER NEW PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED- WE FIND THAT THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR. WHAT THE APPROPRIATE STATUTORY VEHICLE WOULD BE FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS PROPOSAL ADMINISTRATION IS CURRENTLY- PROPOSING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL LARGELY BASED ON THE RATIONALE THAT FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS- GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE NEW GRAMS. IF THE LEGISLATURE WISHES TO HAVE GREATER INPUT ON THE ULTIMATE DESIGN AND STRUCK OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS THAT NEED FOR TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION OR ARE AN ALTERNATIVE VEHICLE- YOU KNOW FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROPOSAL. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF FUNDING THAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE- FINALLY WE WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE THAT IT'S CURRENTLY UNCLEAR HOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALIGN OR COMPLEMENT EXISTING WORKFORCE EFFORTS IN H. CHI- FOR EXAMPLE THE WORK FORCE COMPONENTS OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE WHICH- I'M ALSO VERY BROADLY TARGET BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROVIDERS- WE FIND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. COULD CLEARLY ARTICULATE HOW THESE PROPOSALS WILL TOGETHER COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER TOWARDS REACHING A TARGET GOAL OF ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS- THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO DUPLICATION OF FUNDING BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES. AS YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT STRICTLY FOR PROVIDERS WHO TREAT ADULTS- THE ADMINISTRATION COULD ALSO CLEARLY ARTICULATE HOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE EVALUATED. AND HOW THESE EVALUATION ACTIVITIES WOULD BE SYNTHESIZED WITH- EVALUATIONS OF EACH BECAUSE OTHER WORKFORCE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THESE EVALUATION EFFORTS ARE ARE- SILOS- AND THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND- WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE. QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY I AGREE WITH IT IS THAT I'M MORE SICK IN YOUR I'VE BEEN DOING HERE BUT WE'RE WHAT WHAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS AND WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT IT'S FAIRLY NEBULOUS AT THAT SOME POINT AND WE ALL KNOW WHICH IS NEEDED. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO GET SOME ACTUAL CONCRETE NUMBERS AND I. BYE I TRUST. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEPUTY SOMEBODY RESULT- AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE THAT. THAT THAT LINE WITH ALL THE- THE SKID THE SLIPPER. NO SKIN ON THE ON THE BRONX OF THE LATTER. BUT I THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE DEPEND I HAVE BOTH RAISED- WILL BE MORE OVERSIGHT GOING FORWARD AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU. AS WE FIGURE OUT SOME OF THESE TONY ISSUES AND MAYBE YOU WANT OUR HELP MAYBE WANT MORE FOR HELP AND WE'RE HERE TO WE'RE HERE TO HOT FOR HELPERS. OKAY OF ANY ANYTHING AGAIN I WOULD AGREE WITH THE L. A. AS COMMENTS- I MEAN FOR COURSES AT AM OF. BEFORE I GOT A LEGISLATORS WORKFORCE RESEARCHER SO I MEAN THIS MIGHT YOU KNOW ACADEMIC SPECIALTY- AND- YOU KNOW I THINK NEEDS TO BE A- YOU KNOW. NUMBERS HER EIGHT AND PRODUCTION SOMETIMES IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE WRONG BUT I MEAN THAT I'VE ACTUALLY TRIED TO PULL OUT THE NUMBERS IN THE STATE THAT'S WHY POINTED OUT IN TERMS OF THE PRIMARY KERR FLIGHT. WITH SO WE KNOW THERE'S A DECLINE SO WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW WE KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGE DECLINE MIGHT BE. SO SAME WITH BEHAVIOR HEALTH EXACTLY HOW MANY BUT THEN WE ALSO NEED THE SPECIFIC WHICH TYPE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PEOPLE DO WE NEED BECAUSE WHAT THE DIFFERENT ROLES RIGHT SO WE COULD NOT JUST ENOUGH THAT WE NEED MORE PEOPLE HEALTH WORKERS RIGHT WE NEED TO KNOW. WHAT EACH PERSON'S GOING TO DO. THEIR WHAT THEIR SKILL SETS ARE RIGHT DOWN TO DO NOT KNOW SORRY ALL INTERCHANGEABLE. YOU KNOW IT'S AND IT'S AND- SO WE NEED TO HAVE TARGETS- BASED ON WHAT THE DEMAND IS AND THAT'S WHY I ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE MAN'S ASSESSMENTS AS WELL FROM. WHEN HE CAME TO THAT YOU'D BE ABLE HEALTH SO WE NEED TO WE CAN MAKE. PATIENT. IN I BELIEVE- THE ONE BIGGEST. JUST CAME OUT FOR. RE BUT WE THE BUDGET CAME. AND I KNOW THAT WAS DONE BY A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT BUT I'M ASSUMING. THERE IS GOING TO BE- SOME DISSEMINATION SHARING. ABOUT THAT BIG NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT WAS JUST COMPLETED- AND HOW IT IS GOING TO APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. IS THAT CORRECT. ABSOLUT ABSOLUTELY OKAY- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. OKAY REQUIRED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANKS FOR THE VERY WELL TAKEN- I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT AS AT THIS STAGE ADMINISTRATION DOES ANTICIPATE THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE ADMINISTERED THEIR HIV CURRENT PROGRAM SO NOW TRAILER BILL HAS BEEN PROPOSED AT THIS TIME- BUT AGAIN YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE- HARGETT PROVIDER GOALS AS WELL AS- I'M- A MECHANISM FOR EVALUATION AND- AN ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION ON- HOW DO YOU- CURRENT PROPOSALS ALIGN WITH EXISTING H. I. PROGRAM. YOUR YOUR TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU- WE CAN PROVIDE THAT IN WRITING. THANK YOU WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY- THEN LET US MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT CLINICAL IN CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS CAROUSEL- SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES ONE TIME FUNDING OF FORTY MILLION GENERAL FUND YOUR H. CHI JUST SUPPORT ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. ARGENIS PROPOSAL- I WILL DIRECT TWENTY MILLION GENERAL FUND TOWARD EXISTING SCHOLARSHIP IN LAW ENDOWMENT PROGRAMS FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE PROVIDERS WHICH INCLUDES PHYSICIANS NURSE MIDWIVES PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE COMMITTEE PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE- THESE PROGRAMS HAVE THE FOLLOWING GOALS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS PROVIDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND INCREASE. THE WORKFORCE SERVING MEDICARE MEMBERS. FOR USE BECAUSE HUSING PROGRAM INDUSTRY INCREASE AWARDS TO PRACTITIONERS MORE QUICKLY THAN DEVELOPING A NEW PROGRAM THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOAN REPAYMENT STEVEN M. THOMPSON PHYSICIAN CAR WANTING PAYMENT IN ADVANCE PRACTICE HEALTHCARE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS. THE SECOND PART OF THIS PROPOSAL DIRECTS TWENTY MILLION TOWARDS ASSISTING-HEALTHCARE FACILITIES TO IMPROVE SECURITY AND CYBER. PROTECTIONS INCLUDING SPENDING TOWARDS FACILITY SECURITY CYBERSECURITY SECURITY PERSONNEL AND RETRAINING STAFF. H. PRAYER WILL WORK WITH THE MANAGING ORGANIZATIONS IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM TO ADMINISTER THESE ONE TIME FUNDS TO PROVIDERS OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES WE RECENTLY LEARNED THAT CALLOW YES AS EXCESSIVELY IN ADMINISTERED GRANT PROGRAM FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE PAST HOUR EXPLORING A POTENTIAL IN ARRANGING INSTAGRAM AT WITH OUR- WE ASKED TO UTILIZE THAT SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. FOR THIS COMPONENT OF THE FUNDING. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE REPETITIVE REPORT SPECIFIC QUESTION A NOTE THAT AGAIN PRE SHAPE THE PRESENTATION I GUESS JUST MORE OF AN OBSERVATION AND IT'S SO VERY NECESSARY- THAT- THINGS THAT WE DO NEED TO FIND UNFORTUNATELY IS ALSO MORE PROTECTION AND SAFETY FOR THESE FACILITIES SERVICE AND- LIKE I THINK IT WAS- A CLINIC THAT WAS. ACTUALLY BURNED DOWN IN ANOTHER STATE UNFORTUNATELY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY RESORT TO DESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE AND- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. STATION SERVICE SAFE AND STAFF ARE SAFE. IN THESE FACILITIES AND THAT- WE NEED DO NEED TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS AS WELL OF COURSE THE VERY IMPORTANT VESTMENTS AND- AND- THE STAFF AND THE- TO BE SURE WE HAVE PEOPLE THERE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE STOCK. IS VERY IMPORTANT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAVE PORTION KERR'S HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY ISSUE NUMBER NINE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IS ONCE AGAIN INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO GETTING IT DONE THIS YEAR WE POSED TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE YESTERDAY WHICH WHICH I KNOW HAS BEEN GIVING YOU A LOT OF TIME TO REVIEW IT SO I WILL GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED OFFICE- AT A HIGH LEVEL AS WELL AS GO THROUGH THE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FROM LAST YEAR. TO THIS YEAR. YOU WOULD DISAGREE THAT HIGH HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. JUST LAST WEEK THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION RELEASED THEIR HEALTH POLICY SURVEY. IN WHICH 83% OF CALIFORNIANS INTERVIEWED. SAID IT WAS EXTREMELY OR VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE TO WORK ON MAKING HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE THIS YEAR. THE IN THE IN THE SAME SURVEY WERE CONCERNING RESULTS SHOWING THE IMPACT ON AFFORDABLE COST HAVE HONOR STATES RESIDENTS. HALF OF CALIFORNIANS OF HEALTH CARE IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS DUE TO COST. AMONG THOSE WHO POSTPONED HERE FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. THAT THEIR CONDITION WORSENED AS A RESULT WHICH IS AN INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR'S SURVEY. OF 41% SO I THINK- WHAT WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE OF STATE. ACT UNAFFORDABILITY HAS AND IT'S REALLY- IMPACTING PATIENTS HEALTH. THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY OFFERS A FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS HEALTH CARE COSTS BY COLLECTING DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND COST DRIVERS AND DRIVERS OF DRIVERS OF HEALTH CARE SPENDING AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING THE COST OF HEALTH CARE WHILE MAINTAINING QUALITY AND EQUITY OF CARE WHICH IS CRITICAL. AS NOTED ON THE AGENDA A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES HAVE SIMILAR OFFICES AND WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA'S TIME HAS COME. THE OFFICE WOULD ANALYSE THE HEALTHCARE MARKET FOR COST TREND THE DRIVERS OF SPENDING WITHIN FORCE THE HEALTH CARE TARGET SET BY A NEW HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY BOARD. AND WOULD MEASURE KEY INDICATORS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ACHIEVING A HIGH VALUE SYSTEM RATHER THAN A LOW COST LOW VALUE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE WANT IS THAT AS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. SO I WANT TO JUST GO THROUGH THE KEY ACTIVITIES OF THE PROPOSED OFFICE AND THE BOARD. SO THE OFFICE WAITING FIRST OF ALL USE TRANSPARENCY- INCREASED PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY ON TOTAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN THE STATE. THE OFFICE WOULD REQUIRE REPORTING OF TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE DATA AND THEN WOULD HAVE THAT BROKEN DOWN BY SERVICE CATEGORY. YOU KNOW HOSPITAL CARE PHYSICIAN SERVICES JUST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS XCERRA. THIS DATA WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH FINANCIAL REPORTS FROM PROVIDERS AS WELL AS GRANULAR CLAIMS DATA FROM THE EMERGING HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS DATA SYSTEM. THE OFFICE WOULD PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PUBLIC MEETING ON HEALTHCARE SPENDING TRENDS AND UNDERLYING FACTORS ALONG WITH POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONTROL COSTS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EQUITY OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUT ESTABLISH A HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY BARGE WHICH WOULD SET AN OVERALL STATEWIDE COST TARGET AS WELL AS- SPECIFIC TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY- AND DIFFERENT JEEP GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS SO I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC MAKE UP AN ACTIVITIES UP THE BOARD WHEN I GO THROUGH THIS YEAR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THE OFFICE WILL ALSO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE BUT THE COST TARGET- AND WOULD TAKE A PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT APPROACH- STARTING WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED TO INCLUDE TESTIMONY AT PUBLIC MEETINGS. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS AND ULTIMATELY ONLY IF NECESSARY ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL PENALTIES. THE OFFICE WOULD PROMOTE AND MEASURE QUALITY IN EQUITY THROUGH PERFORMANCE REPORTING. TO AVOID UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD RESULT FROM FOCUSING ON COST ALONE PERFORMANCE ON QUALITY IN EQUITY MEASURES WILL BE MEASURES WILL BE MEASURED TO GUARD AGINST NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT WE VERY MUCH WANT TO COLLABORATE WITH- AND LEVERAGE THE QUALITY IN EQUITY METRICS BEING DEVELOPED ON A RIGHT NOW BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE BEING USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND COVERED CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE GOAL FOR ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS THAT PROMOTE SHIFTING PAYMENTS FROM A FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL TO PAYMENTS THAT REWARD HIGH QUALITY AND COST EFFICIENT CARE AND PROMOTE A SUSTAINED SYSTEM WIDE INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO DOCTOR PANS. EARLIER WE KNOW THAT MODELS THAT INTEGRATE PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES SO IT MAY BE THAT THIS IS A WAY TO ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL PRIMARY CARE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HEALTH PLANS ARE INVESTING AT THE MEDICAL GROUPS ARE AS WELL. SO THE OFFICE WOULD MEASURE THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL HEALTH CARE. EXPENDITURES ALLOCATED TO PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL EALTH AND THE BOARD BUT DROPPED SPENDING BENCHMARKS ADDRESS HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. COLLECTING DATA AND ANALYZING CHANGES TO THE HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE TO AVOID HARMFUL REDUCTIONS TO THE WORK FORCE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY THE OFFICE WOULD REVIEW PROPOSED HEALTHCARE CONSOLIDATIONS GIVEN THAT THIS CAN BE A DRIVER OF COST THE OFFICE WOULD INCREASE TRACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY ON TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT MARKET COMPETITION. BY REVIEWING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS NOT CURRENTLY REVIEWED BY ANOTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY SO DO YOU MAY SEE IS ALREADY REVIEWING IT WE OF COURSE WOULD NOT IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BUT THIS IS TO FILL IN THE GAPS- WHEN THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY A REGULATORY AGENCY DOING OR IF YOU. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS WORKED WITH DR WHAT DOCTOR PAN AND BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THE LANGUAGE THAT'S LAST YEAR AND BASED ON THOSE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE MADE SOME CHANGES. N THE TRAILER BILL- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT OF THOSE CHANGES. ARE STARTING WITH THE BOARD RATHER THAN THE ADVISORY BOARD APPROACH THAT LAST YEAR'S LANGUAGE TOOK ON THIS YEAR THERE IS A HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY BOARD WHICH WILL SAID HE POLICIES INCLUDING ESTABLISHING THE COST TARGETS THEMSELVES. AS WELL AS THE METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING TARGETS AND FACTORS TO MODIFY THE TARGETS WHEN APPROPRIATE. THEY WILL ALSO- SET FACTORS FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND THE SCOPE AND RANGE OF ANY ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES. THE BOARD WILL APPROVE THE BENCHMARKS FOR PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPEND. THE GOALS FOR THE ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS AND STANDARDS TO ADVANCE. THE STABILITY OF THE HEALTH WORKFORCE- OUR LANGUAGEHAS EIGHT EIGHT MEMBER BOARD WITH SEVEN VOTING MEMBERS. THERE WOULD BE FOR GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENTS SUBJECT TO SENATE CONFIRMATION. I WOULD EACH BY THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER AND THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE. THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY OR THEIR DESIGNEES WOULD BE A VOTING MEMBER. AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE THE CALPERS CHIEF HEALTH DIRECTOR OR THEIR DEPUTIES SERVING AS A NON VOTING MEMBER. SO THAT'S THE BARGE. IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH CARE COST TARGETS- YOU KNOW WE'VE DEFINED THAT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT SO THE HEALTH CARE COST TARGETS ARE THE TARGET PERCENTAGE FOR ANNUAL INCREASE IN PER CAPITA TOTAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES. SO FOR EXAMPLE AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA MASSACHUSETTS AT THEIR COST TARGET GROWTH RATE AT THREE POINT 6% FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. COST TARGETS CANNOT REQUIRE DECREASING COSTS- UNDER THIS YEAR'S LANGUAGE ONLY SET A GROWTH RATE SO WHERE IS LAST YEAR'S. LANGUAGE GROUP- COULD HAVE REQUIRED. USING COSTS ON THIS YEAR IT'S ALWAYS SETTING A MINIMUM GROWTH RATE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT NEW PROVISION ADDRESSES THE IMPACT OF LABOR COSTS ON THE TARGETS UNDER THE LANGUAGE COST TARGETS CAN BE ADJUSTED FOR A PROVIDER OR DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT% DEMONSTRATES THAT NON SUPERVISORY LABOR COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO GROW FASTER THAN THE RATE OF ANY APPLICABLES COST TARGETS. COST TARGETS WILL BE DEVELOPED BASED ON A METHODOLOGY WHICH WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE- AND THEY'RE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THE METHODOLOGY PROMOTES STABILITY OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND MAINTAIN FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION. WHAT'S GOING ON SAID THE DEFINITION SECTION OF THE LANGUAGE- THE DEFINITION OF HEALTH CARE ENTITY CHANGE FROM PAYER OR PROVIDER AND INCLUDES A DEFINITION OF FALLING INTO. A FULLY INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS SPELLED OUT AND WOULD BE INCLUDED AS A HEALTH CARE ENTITIES SUBJECT TO THE COST TARGETS. TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES ARE FURTHER DEFINED AN UPDATED TO INCLUDE EXAMPLES OF NON CLAIMS BASED PAYMENTS BECAUSE OF COURSE WILL WANNA ACCOUNT FOR PERFORMANCE PAYMENTS- ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND THE LIKE. AND THEN IMPORTANTLY THE PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATION DEFINITION IS MODIFIED SO AND THIS IS THE PART BECAUSE IT INCLUDES- WHICH PHYSICIANS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE COST ARE GETS ON THE DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SO DATA PHYSICIAN PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDE RISK BEARING ORGANIZATIONS. IPA'S OR INDEPENDENT PRACTICE ASSOCIATIONS AS WELL AS MEDICAL GROUPS WITH SIXTY OR MORE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. FORTY OR MORE SPECIALISTS HOW FOR A FIFTY PROVIDERS IF IT'S A COMBINED PRACTICE WITH BOTH SPECIALISTS AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. FIND DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING. THE OFFICE WOULD NOT COLLECT DATA FROM EXEMPTS PROVIDERS INCLUDING SMALL PROVIDER GROUPS FROM OTHER STATE AGENCIES THROUGH DATA SHARING AGREEMENT SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED SIR CERTAINLY WITH THE H. U. S. SENATE APARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. THERE WAS A CONCERN RAISED ABOUT PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SO THERE IS A PROVISION ALLOWING THEM TO SUBMIT- ON AUDIT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. IN TERMS OF MONITORING COMPLIANCE- THIS IS ONE OF MANY AREAS WE DISCUSS WITH DOCTOR PAN WE RENAMED CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TO PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN THAT CERTAINLY ALWAYS ARE INTENSE BUT WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THAT'S THAT THE ENFORCEMENT APPROACH- AND THERE'S ALSO A WE'VE CLARIFIED THE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS TO BE INCLUDED IN A PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND YOU'VE- ENFORCEMENT APPROACH. THE OFFICE A LOT APPROVED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS THE PROPOSED TO MEET COST TARGETS IN WAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO A ROAD ACCESS QUALITY IN EQUITY OR WORK FOR STABILITY- SO THERE IS A LOT MORE TO TALK ABOUT WITH THE OFFICE- BUT THOSE ARE ARE THE AN OVERVIEW AND THE CHANGES TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. HI THIS YEAR'S A TWELVE. DIRECTOR FOR THE PRECEDING THE PRESENTATION- OBVIOUSLY IS. THIS PEOPLE COMPLY TELL FROM YOUR PRESENTATION THIS IS- THERE'S A LOT OF POLICY IN THIS TRAILER BILL SO IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE THAT- AFFECTS THE- WHAT IS CURRENTLY WAS ABOUT 1718% OF OUR HEALTH OUR ECONOMY- SO OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WE WERE ABLE TO. DO LAST YEAR- I THINK THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN RESOLVE- BECAUSE I TO LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THIS DONE AS AS YOU SAID. AND AND- LOOKING FORWARD TO AGAIN GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS TO ON THOSE UNRESOLVED ISSUES. AND YET APPRECIATE THE- ON GOING DISCUSSION SO. FRANKLY I THINK IF WE HAD A THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF THE TRAILER BILL WE WOULD BE HERE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER FEW HOURS- WE GIVEN THE SCOPE AND THE DETAIL BUT REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION LOOKING FORWARD TO. WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION YOU TO MINISTRATION INSPECTOR DOLLY AND OTHERS. AND HOPEFULLY CRAFTING I HAD A- OF. THAT VERSION THAT- WE CAN ALL.

MADAM CHAIR JUST OUT REALLY REALLY QUICK- JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY- YOU KNOW WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL THAT WAS RELEASED LAST NIGHT- INCLUDING FOR.

AREAS PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT FOCUS ON ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUES- WHICH WOULD INCLUDE A FURTHER ANALYSIS OF.

ENSURE THAT IT WITH ITS- ALTERNATELY SUCCESSFUL AT CONTROLLING HEALTH CARE COSTS- AND- YOU KNOW WHAT WILL TO SORT OF LEAVE IT AT THAT HERE IN JUST NOTE THAT. YOU KNOW A FURTHER ANALYSIS IS COMING ONCE WE HAD. A SORT OF LOOK AT THE DEAL. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO PROVIDE A FINANCIAL ANYTHING. OKAY THANK YOU FROM OKAY. I THINK THAT'S IT.

AND ALL MY ON JUST QUICKLY PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANNUAL HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN. ALTHOUGH COMMITTEE AND QUALITY REVIEWS THAT WERE PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT- EARLIER THIS WEEK WHERE WE RELEASED A LIST OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THEN SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE ALL TWENTY TWO OF THEM- OUR FIRST MEETING IS GOING TO OCCUR ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FOUR- UP THIS YEAR THIS MONTH. SO WE'RE EXCITED TO GET KICK OFF THAT WORK- WE'VE ALSO SELECTED AN EXTERNAL CONSULTANT SELLERS DORSEY WHO WAS HELPING US PREPARE FOR THE FIRST MEETING AND WILL FACILITATE THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND ASSIST WITH SUMMARIZING THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN A REPORT LATER THIS YEAR. BASED ON THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS ESTABLISH A PRIORITY SET OF QUALITY MEASURES AND HEALTHEQUITY QUALITY BENCHMARKS FOR ALL SIR FULL SERVICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS.

H. TRYING TO COVER CALIFORNIA CALPERS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. I'M EXCITED THAT WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS OF WILL SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE AS EX OFFICIO. NONVOTING MEMBERS- SO WITH THAT I WILL PAUSE AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OTHER WEEK OTHERWISE WE CAN MOVE ON TO ANOTHER PMR PCPS. I THINK BUSH'S ORDER TO PRINT AS QUESTION GOOD YEAH OKAY UP BEFORE GET TO THE CITY SO. ACTUALLY TO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT. SURE YOU'RE DOING THAT EQUITY IN QUALITY WERE. AND SO LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT BUT I KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT COME UP AND PASS HEARINGS. IS GETTING GOOD DATA COLLECTION FROM THE PLANS I KNOW THERE WAS ONE YEAR WHERE LITERALLY. I THINK LIKE LESS THAN. 10% HAVING OF PLANTS PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE DATA WE HAD TO GO BACK THOUGH YOU KNOW THROUGH THIS. SO WHAT IS THE STATUS OF OUR- DATA COLLECTION FROM PLANTS TO BE ABLE TO APPROPRIATE ENFORCEMENT OF START TIMELY STANDARD ALRP. HE TURNED OUT AS A STANDBY ACCESS STANDARDS OTHER TYPE SO- SO WILL- BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WE CAN ENFORCE THEM BEFORE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION SO- AND SO I KNOW THAT YOU'VE THAT THAT'S BEEN WORKING BUT IS ALSO SEEMS TO BE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LAG GOES. BECAUSE YOU DO THE SURVEY. AND THEN YOU ANALYZE IT AND THEN. NOW TO THE TO OLD BEFORE YOU GO ABOUT DO ANYTHING IT SO. WHERE WHERE WHERE ARE WE NOW WITH- THE QUALITY OF DATA WE'RE GETTING FROM PLANS FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE TAXES STANDARDS. SURE ONLY FIFTEEN WAS THE YEAR WE HAD- SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND COULDN'T EVEN REPORT ON THE DATA- THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF THE DATA THAT IS COMING AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. HAVE A REPORT AND YOU GOT ANALYSIS EVERY YEAR SOUNDS- I WILL SAY THAT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WE MADE TO THE METHODOLOGY WAS REQUIRE EACH- THE PLANS TO HAVE A VENDOR OR CONSULTANT REVIEW AND AN AUDIT THAT THEY WERE COMPLYING WITH THE- METHODOLOGY- SO THERE'S SOME. OVERSIGHT THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE- DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD IN TERMS OF THE COLLECTION REPORTING OF DATA SO. WE CONTINUE TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE REPORTING THANKFULLY. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW AND NOW THE OTHER I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION WAS IS THAT- AT THE FRANKLY THE SOME OF THE AND- THE- THE STANDARDS THAT LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT- SO- BECAUSE- NO COMPLIANCE. MAY BE REALIZED HERE EXPECTED ONE BE 100% SIDE I THINK. THE COMPLIANCE RATE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO BE BETTERED AND LIKE 80% OR SOMETHING AND I GET THAT RIGHT I MEAN IT IT'S- 70% OF THE 70% SO THAT MEDIA 70% SO THAT'S IT MEANS ALMOST ONE IN THREE YEAR TIMES STILL FOR A CONSUMER. IF THEY FAILED TO TIMELY ACCESS STANDARD. I GUESS IT'S TECHNICALLY ONE ENTRY LEVEL A LESS THAN ONE THREE THEN THEN THE PLANE WENT I MEAN SO. SO WHAT ARE YOU FINDING FROM PLAN TELL ME PLANS OR SORT OF WICKS AN INMATE I THINK BE INTERESTING TO KNOW MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE SAFETY FINGERTIPS HOW MANY PLANS ARE NINETY PERCENTILE AYE MERE TECHNICALLY ALL THOSE PLANS ARE QUOTE OKAY. BUT YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T START THINKING SEVENTY PERCENTILE WELL. THAT'S ALMOST ONE IN THREE TIMES THAT SOMEONE'S NOT ACTUALLY BEING THE STANDARD. SO IS IT IN SOME I MEAN. SO WHAT ARE MOST OF PLAN SITTING IN THAT EIGHTY THIS IS ABOUT SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PERCENTILE OR YOU KNOW IT I MEAN I DO. IT WHEN WE DEVELOP THE STANDARDS WE THOUGHT OF THEM AS MINIMUM STANDARDS NOT STANDARDS THAT WERE. YOU KNOW. IDEAL SO CONTINUE SPEAK CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHERE PLANS ARE UNDERSTAND AND IN RELATION TO THE STANDARDS. SURE YEAH LOOK LET ME LET ME TALK ABOUT THE SEVENTY PERCENT- PARTMINER WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN WE CONDUCTED WAR WITH THE HEALTH PLANS CONDUCTED THE SURVEY AND THEY CALLED A RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE PROVIDERS- 70% OR MORE OF THE PROVIDERS THAT ANSWERED THAT CALL FOR THE SURVEY- HOW TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT AVAILABLE WITHIN THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS THAT ARE WITHIN THE LAW- THE TIME NEXUS STANDARDS DON'T MEAN THAT- EVERY SINGLE PROVIDER THAT YOU WANT TO SEE- WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AVAILABLE ON THE DATE. THE TIME WHEN YOU WANT TO SEE THEM BUT IT MEANS THAT THE NETWORK NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR PROVIDED A POINT WITHIN THOSE STANDARDS- SO THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE A PROVIDER MAY NOT HAPPEN APPOINTMENT WHEN THEY'RE CALLED THEY MAY BE ON VACATION THEY MAY BE WORKING PART TIME. AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS CONTRACTED WHY THEY NOT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE STANDARD. BUT WE AND WHAT WE EXPECT IS THAT THAT 70% MEANS THAT THE NETWORK SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT IN A TIMELY APPOINTMENT I WILL SAY THAT 70% STANDARD WAS HORRIFIED ARE REGULATION WHICH WAS RECENTLY APPROVED WILL BE TAKING A FACT. AND SO GOING FORWARD- WE WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD THE HEALTH PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT STANDARD IS NOT BEEN CODIFIED IN REGULATION FOR THAT SO- WE HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT WILL BE REPLACING THE TWENTY TWENTY AND A REPORT HERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I'M AND TAKE A LOOK AT BE ABLE TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE THE PLANTS ARE. IN TERMS OF MAKING THAT THAT STANDARD. OKAY WELL I TAKE A FOR PRE PEOPLE REALIZE. AS A STEP THAT. IS YOU KNOW WE'RE- LASERS INTO CIRCUMSTANCES- BUT- WHEN WAS WITH WE'RE DEVELOPING WHETHER WE MODIFIED IN THE FUTURE OR WHATEVER ELSE AND I KNOW YOU WANT TO REGULATORY PROCESS THAT WE ARE. SAYING THAT THAT THE IF YOU'RE- ACTUALLY TAKES EFFECT IN THAT AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW FAR YOU LOOKED EXTREME GO YOU KNOW AND THE OTHER ACCOUNT. BUT WHEN YOU'RE THAT 70% YOU KNOW HOW HOW FAR SO THIRTY FIVE METERS OF ISSUESFOR PERHAPS SOME POLICY REFINEMENT- THEN I GUESS ONE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL COLD AND I KNOW THAT- DME SEES BEEN BUSY WITH THE TRYING TO ENFORCE A CODE STANDARDS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE FEDERAL STANDARDS CENTER OUT THERE OBVIOUSLY YOU FORCE OR STATE STANDARDS- YOU KNOW WHEN THE THINGS THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN CERTAINLY HITTING THE NEWS AND- AND ARE YOU WORKING ON THROUGH LEGISLATION I DID. ASSURING THAT PEOPLE GET PAYMENT FOR PROTESTS AND A TESTING- SO CAN YOU JUST. PERHAPS SPEAK TO THE- WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. AND TO ENSURING PEOPLE GET THERE THE DATA TESTS ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT THEY GET THEM PAID FOR- SINCE THE YOU KNOW. SINCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SER SAID YOU GO THROUGH YOUR INSURANCE PLAN- AND THEN OF COURSE WE'VE HAD LEGISLATION THAT PARALLELED. SOME CENTER FEDERAL GUIDANCE. SO NOW. MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK SINCE SINCE THE TURN OF THE GAME REIMBURSED BY HEALTH PLANS FALLS IN YOUR LAP- SO- THE TERMS PEOPLE BE SURE THEY CAN GET THEIR THEIR TESTS. AND NOT HAVE FINANCIAL BARRIERS. YEAH NO ABSOLUTELY AND I WILL SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IS BEEN KEEPING US VERY BUSY WITH ADELINE STAGE- THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE WERE PROVIDED ME THE UTMOST PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE DO HAVE THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT NOW THAT HEALTH PLANS COVER WORK FOR COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS THAT THEY'RE COVERING UP TO EIGHT OR AT LEAST EIGHT AT HOME COVERAGE US- ND REIMBURSE YOU NOT GOING TO SAY TWELVE DOLLARS OR SERVE NO ONE SAYS CHECK OUT- SO ALL OF THE HEALTH PLAN SHOULD HAVE A- OF. A PROCESS ON THEIR WEBSITE OR BY CALLING THE HEALTH PLAN- CHECK TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THOSE AT HOME TO US. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE COVERAGE FOR OTHER TYPES OF TRUST AS WELL AS VACCINES- I WILL JUST SAY IF ANYBODY NEEDS INFORMATION WE HAVE FACT SHEETS AND INFORMATION OR WHAT OUR WEBSITE AT HEALTH HELP DOT CA DOT GOV- IF ANYBODY IS HAVING ANY CHALLENGES GETTING REIMBURSED EITHER FOR THEIR AT HOME CHEST WORK FINDING OR GETTING- EITHER BECAUSE THEY TEST FOR A VACCINATION PAID FOR- I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM FIRST TO CALL THEIR HEALTH PLAN AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASSIST THEM BUT IF NOT OUR HELP CENTER IS. ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO HELP CONSUMERS NAVIGATE WHAT ARE SOMETIMES VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S GETTING THE TEST BOX NATION THAT NEED. APPRECIATE THAT SOME COMPLAINTS ARE SOME OF THE PLANS THAT. THEY ALSO PLAN TO MAKE IT EASY SOME PLANS MAKE IT HARD GRADE SO YOU GOTTA DOWNLOAD A PIECE OF PAPER FILE THAT MALE ATHLETES AT THE CHECK IT'S ADDRESS. I THINK SOME CONSUMERS ARE TRYING TO FINALLY EXPERIENCE WHAT WHAT DOCTORS OF EXPERIENCE. REALIZE HOW PAINFUL IT IS SO TO GET PAID SO- BUT HOPEFULLY TEAMMATES IS GOING TO WORK WITH THE HEALTH PLANS TO TRY TO MAKE IT. EASIER. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT. THE STAFF TO GO THROUGH WHAT THE AFTER THROUGH. AND TRY TO ENCOURAGE THEM ALL TO MAKE IT. FOR TO GET ME. FOR THE TESTS WE WANT PEOPLE TO GET TO OF THE NEW WHAT THEY'RE- OFF MOTHER BEAR. PEOPLE GET TESTS. OF THE WITH THE READY. WE DO WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN. YOU KNOW INSPECTED THE FREIGHT TO GET TESTS SO THEY DON'T KNOW AND THEN SPREADING CONTINUE TO SPREAD THE DISEASE.

PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN CAN BE HERE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL SPROUT LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THERE ARE FOUR THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING WE HAVE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS THAT THEY'RE FACING IN TERMS OF ACCESSING THOSE FUNDS AND BEING ABLE TO DEPLOY THE KINDS THAT'S COMMON HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS. THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUT IN OTHER COMMUNITIES. I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE. THAT I DID MENTION THAT IN THE BROAD OVERVIEW. IN TERMS OF THE SEVENTY IN HIS BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE THE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM. YOU KNOW THIS IS. A PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS DISCUSSED LAST YEAR FOR WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. TO PUT TOGETHER AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT SO THAT THE COMMISSION CAN EXPAND UPON THE WORK THAT IT'S ALREADY BEEN DOING. IN THE AREAS THAT THAT WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE BROADER ADMINISTRATION. IN TERMS OF THOSE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT WILL BE SUPPORTED WITH THE APP THAT THE BROAD FINDING THAT WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THERE'S 10% THAT WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR THE COMMISSION WE WILL BE SERVING ON THE- ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PUTTING TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY HOW THE SUN SHALL BE USED. YEAH AND THAT FUNDING THAT WOULD TRANSFER TO THE COMMISSION WOULD BE USED TO. SUPPORT THAT BROUGHT INITIATIVE WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE AND BUILD UPON THAT WHERE RELEVANT. I WOULD ASK THE PERMANENT FINANCE TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUNDING. BUT IN TERMS OF THE GOALS OF THE STRATEGY I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND. BERMAN I THINK WE'RE OKAY NOW. I MOVED TO THE IF YOU THREE. YES THANK YOU SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A SMALL ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT SOME ADDITIONAL STAFF. AS WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO BUILD OUT THIS KNOW HOW STUDENT SERVICES ACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT ARE BECOMING VERY APPARENT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT WORKFORCE THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY- WE'RE REALLY SEEING TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES AS OUR SCHOOLS ARE CAN BE A HEALTH PROGRAMS ARE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS AND OTHER PROGRAMS BEGIN TO COMPETE. FOR LIMITED POOL OF STAFF AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S- YEAH EVEN BEST A LOT OF TIME IN ADMINISTRATION IS INVESTING A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY TO ADDRESS I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF PROGRAMMATIC INVESTMENTS. THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO IDENTIFY THE CONTINUOUS SERVICE SAYS THAT COUNTIES AND SCHOOL PARTNER SHOULD BE INVESTING IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE GET. ROUTINELY FROM OUR LOCAL PARTNERS IS HOW CAN THEY MAKE BEST USE OF THESE FUNDS. AND WE DO NOT YET KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT MIX OF SERVICES IS OUR FOR THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS. IN SCHOOL SETTINGS AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS IN THE HOME- DEPENDING ON ON WHAT THE NEEDS ARE WHO THE INDIVIDUAL IS. SO WE'RE SEEKING ADDITIONAL STAFFING SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO STRENGTHEN OUR CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT AND THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. WITH INVESTMENT THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED UNDER THE MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT. THANK YOU. MOVE MOVING ON IF I AM FOR IS THE EVALUATION OF CLOSER PARTNERSHIP FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP MODEL IT WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER SB FOUR SIX FIVE AGAIN THANK YOU LEADERSHIP ON THAT AGAIN WERE BREATHTAKING STAFF SUPPORT TO IMPLEMENT THE- THE PARAMETERS ARE TESTED FOR SIX FIVE. ZERO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A STAFF POSITION AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS FUNDING TO DO THE ANALYTIC WORK AS NECESSARY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND FSB'S SO I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT RUNS AT SOMEWHERE IN THE BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR FINDING RANGE AND SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BEST UNDERSTAND IF WE'RE GETTING ARE THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK AND IF NOT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. OKAY AND THAT. IF I'M NOT IF I'M NOT READING THIS WRONG THAT COMPLETES YOUR- PORTION IS THAT CORRECT. ABSOLUTELY TRYING TO BE VERY EFFICIENT HERE YOU ARE VERY EFFICIENT AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- THAT I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND I THINK THIS IS THE YEAR THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS REALLY GOING TO START SHINING PEERS WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I AND I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR YEARS LONGER THAN WE HAVE AND SO WE'RE FINALLY CATCHING UP WITH YOUR CHORUS AND SING ALONG WITH YOU- WE APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND AS WE- CONTINUE TO REALLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT. IF THE BEST WAY THE BEST USE OF OUR RESOURCES. THEN TAKEN THEN THEN TO DIRECT MORE RESOURCES. TO WHAT WORKS BEST TO HELP- MOST VULNERABLE. AND AGAIN AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL DAY LONG IT IS A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING ON SOME OF THE FRONT AND PSYCHOSIS IT JUST VITALLY IMPORTANT- THE THAT THAT PART GETS DONE IN THE BEGINNING. AB SO I. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS. AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING SOME. SOME UPDATES OF THE OF THAT ENTIRE PROGRAM. WHICH WILL COME WITH A LOT MORE OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH I THINK WAS ONE OF THE THINGS LACKING WHEN IT WAS FIRST PUT- BYE BYE EVIDENCE OF IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND WE'RE STILL STILL NOT REALLY SURE WHERE ALL THE MONEY'S GOING. AND IF IT'S EFFECTIVE SO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON WE WILL BE VERY INTERESTED. IN FOLLOWING UP AND HEARING A LOT MORE ABOUT IT. I'M GOING TO START TO PANIC HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES- AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- THE AND CERTAINLY- I THINK THERE'S TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING SO HOPEFULLY- WHILE WE MAYBE. TRY TO BE BRIEF HERE THAT DOESN'T WAY STE- THAT'S IN TERMS OF THAT'S AN INDICATION OF THE IMPORTANCE THAT- WEEK WE GET TO THE WORKS OF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN TERMS OF THESE SELF PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAMS- BECAUSE THAT. IS A POSE THE QUESTION TO- AND NOW. AROUND HERE HEALTH INITIATIVE. NO HAVE- OFTENTIMES RESULT BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND THE EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS RIGHT AND- OF COURSE THE KIDS TO GO TO SCHOOL AND THEN THEY GO HOME. AND THE CAT IS SO- SO IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE- PUTTING SOME FUNDS FOR IMPORTANT FUNDS TO HELP INDUCE EVALUATION AS WELL AS US. THESE PROGRAMS. HAVE BEEN WHICH WAY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE A THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN THIS AREA CAN HELP INFORM THE- THAT BEHAVIOR HELP ME ON THE U. FEVER HEALTH INITIATIVE AND WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE GETTING SOME. RESULTS THAT YOU MIGHT FEEL THIS. TO SHARE NÂNG WITH THEM BUT ALSO WITH US AS WELL. AND BEST PRACTICE MODELS YEAH SO THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION THE COMMISSION HAS A RECORD DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK ON MARCH FIRST THAT WILL PRIMARILY FOCUS ON WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES SOME OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF YEARS TO BEGIN TO ROLL OUT THE STRATEGIES AND SO WE HAVE SO THERE'S THE OPTION TO LEARN MORE. FROM THOSE PARTNERS THAN THOSE WHO FOR EXAMPLE WERE AWARDED FUNDS JUST EARLIER THIS WEEK SO- SO I THINK YOU KNOW THE FIRST. IS JUST SOME CLARIFICATION OF WHERE WE ARE. AND THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING AND THE REALITIES THAT ARE THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WE BEGAN TO TRY TO AS YOU SAID SORT OF STRENGTH IN AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE STYLING. BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AT ITS CORE THAT WAS THE COMMISSION'S INTENTION. IN TERMS OF RELIGION IS FUNDS AS WE WERE VERY EXPLICIT THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE ROBUST PARTNERSHIP SO WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE SILOS. BUT HOW THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WERE FORMED AND HOW AND WHERE THEY FOCUS NEEDED TO BE WORKED OUT LOCALLY SO THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIVE TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THESE COMMUNITIES. THE STRENGTH OF THAT APPROACH IS THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE RESPONSIVE AND TIMELY. THE LIMITATION IS IT MEANS YOU'VE GOT FIFTY FOUR DIFFERENT APPROACHES WHICH MAKES IT VERY HARD. TO CREATE A CONSISTENT UNDERSTANDING. FROM FROM THE NOTION OF A SINGLE PROGRAM IT'S A PROGRAM IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING SOURCE AND THE STRATEGY THAT WE'RE ROLLING OUT. BUT IT'S NOT A PROGRAM IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES SO TO SPEAK. ACROSS ALL OFTHESE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE FACTOR OF TIME- WHERE WE HAVE ROLE THESE DOLLARS OUT I BELIEVE ACROSS FIVE DIFFERENT. STUFF FUNDING CYCLES SO WE'RE STILL WORKING TO- KIND OF CATCH UP. AND LISTEN AND LEARN FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FARTHER ALONG WHILE ALSO TRYING TO SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THIS YEAR WORKING WITH THE TWENTY COUNTIES THAT DID NOT APPLY TO PRIOR FUNDING CYCLES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE BEARS THEY FACED. ENTER INTO THE HAIR BACK. THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM SO THAT WE HAD THE FEWEST REQUIREMENTS WE COULD. PUT IN. INTO THAT PROGRAM WHILE STILL COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS- IS THE STATE FUNDING RULES- BY JUST AS THE FEDERAL AND THE FEDERAL. FUNDING RULES IN THE INSTANCES WHERE REASONS ON THE FUNDING. SO I. SENATOR I THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS AT LEAST. TO REALLY. BE ABLE TO CONNECT AN INTERVENTION. TO AN EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T LEARN SOMETHING. ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THESE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ARE IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE SILO ING ISSUE. THAT IS OFTEN AT THE CORE OF WHY. MANY OF THESE FAMILIES ARE STARVING NEED ACCESS TO CARE AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE NEED TO REALLY BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE CAN SAY. AROUND ISSUES LIKE GOVERNANCE AND INCENTIVES BARRIERS TO CARE THE NEED FOR TRAINING AND THE IMPACT THAT THOSE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS ARE HAVING. IT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION TO THEN SAY EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES ARE ON THE UPSWING BECAUSE WE'VE MADE THERE THESE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS IN MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING- YOU KNOW IN SAY. MIDDLE SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE STRUGGLING. AT NIGHT OF APPRECIATE THAT IN A IN AND REALIZE THAT- YOU KNOW TAKES TIME TO DO VALUATION AND I'VE SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE. THE PROCESS MUST HAVE GONE ON LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO EVALUATE AND SEE EXACTLY SOME DATA- SO. BUT I GUESS I ALSO HOPE THAT- IS WE'RE RUNNING THESE THINGS IN PARALLEL WE TALK ABOUT THE URGENCY OF BEING ABLE TO TRUST THINGS FOR EXAMPLE WENT. HOPEFULLY AND MAYBE USING QUALITATIVE APPROACHES AT LEAST WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT HOW LEAST THAT. THE PROGRAMS HAVE COME TOGETHER HOW THEY MANAGED TO YOU KNOW GET THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER HOW TO GET EDUCATION COUNTY TO WORK. SOME OF THE PER EVEN SOME OF THE PROCESS LESSONS MIGHT BE VERY HELPFUL AS WE'RE TRYING TO ROLL OUT THE OTHER INITIATIVE AS WELL SO- SO I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE BIG EVALUATION THAT THE PRIDE ONE THAT NOW THAT THE- WHAT REALLY HAPPENED EVALUATION. I CAN'T TAKE PLACE FOR MANY YEARS. BUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME INTERIM STUFF ESPECIALLY ON THE QUALITATIVE SIDE THAT. WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER INVESTING IN THAT WAY TO HELP INFORM. LIKE HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE COUNTIES IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO WORK TOGETHER RIGHT AND SO- DOING QUALITATIVE VALUE BEYOND THE RESEARCH ON. THIS DONE PEOPLE HAVE COME TOGETHER NOW WE DO ON THE SUCCESSFUL THERE COLLABORATION END UP. BY AT LEAST WE THE- MANAGED AS WORK TOGETHER BY EVEN THAT MIGHT YET HAVE A BEAR SOME- SOME. USEFUL INFORMATION FOR US MOVING FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY THAT HE SAID THAT VERY WELL BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN I DID NO ONE ONE NO I WANT TO JUST COMMENT ON. IS ACROSS THESE FIND WE HAVE A COUNTIES THAT ARE EITHER FUNDING OR PLANNING TO FIND. A YOUTH WELLNESS CENTERS ON THEIR CAMPUSES I HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE JUST AND IT JUST PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC KIDDING WE SPONSORED AND IDEA LAB WITH YOUNG PEOPLE FROM FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTY. FOCUSED ON SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AND THE IDEA THAT ROSE TO THE TOP OF ALL OF THEIR DISCUSSION SUPPOSED TO CREATE SAFE SPACES ON CAMPUS WHERE STUDENTS CAN BE THEMSELVES FOR THEY COULD. DE STRESS AND RELAX AND CATCH THEIR BREATH. THIS IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH WORK OUT OF- SOLANO COUNTY. THAT WHERE THE YOUNG PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER AND SAID WELLNESS CENTERS ARE THE BEST WAY THAT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES CAN SUPPORT THAT THEIR THEIR STUDENTS. AND SO ACROSS SEVENTEEN KEY ACROSS EIGHT COUNTIES ARE INVESTING IN TWENTY WELLNESS CENTER FOR PLANNING A SITE VISIT- WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU COME ALONG. WE SEE THESE AS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO BOTH LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO DESIGN THEM IN WAYS THAT IS VERY USE RESPONSIVE. AND NOW WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND AS YOU SAY IT'S A VERY QUALITATIVE MAINS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TAKEAWAYS THAT CAN INFORM. FURTHER CONVERSATIONS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES SHOULD THIS BE A BEST PRACTICE THAT WE CAN SCALE. EVEN WHILE WE'RE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT AT WELLNESS CENTER MIGHT CHANGE MENTAL HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. SO YEAH FOR EXAMPLE AS AN EXAMPLE I THAT COMES TO MIND. IN RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENTS CENTER PAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR AND DILIO. OKAY SEE HEAD SHAKING AT ME OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SURE WE APPRECIATE IT. OKAY NOW WILL MOVE TO OUR FINAL ISSUE. IS COVERED CALIFORNIA. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR DR PAN HI KATIE RAVEL POLICY ELIGIBILITY IN RESEARCH DIRECTOR COVERED CALIFORNIA HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR TO CLOSE OUT ISSUES- THE BULK OF OUR ISSUES ON OUR REPORT BRINGING CARE WITHIN REACH I DO HAVE SOME SLIDES THERE. HAPPY TO JUST ADDRESS ISSUE ONE QUICKLY AND THEN TURN TO THE SLIDES- A THE FEDERAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS WELL SUMMARIZED- IN YOUR COMMITTEE AGENDA BUT IT DID REFORM THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET. AND ESTABLISH PUBLIC MARKETPLACES. FOR COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH PLANS WITH INCOME BASED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOWER PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T HAVE AFFORDABLE COVERAGE THROUGH AN EMPLOYER. THROUGH THE MEDICAID PROGRAM THROUGH MEDICARE COVER CALIFORNIA IS CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE MARKETPLACES ESTABLISHED UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE CONTRACT WITH HELP TWELVE HEALTH INSURANCE CARRIERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LANDS OFFER A PACKAGE OF WHAT'S KNOWN AS ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. CONFERENCE OF SERVICES TO FIND AT A HIGH LEVEL IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEN OUR MEMBERS CHOOSE FROM SEVERAL COVERAGE OPTIONS THAT VARY IN THE AMOUNT OF MONTHLY PREMIUMS THEY PAY VERSUS OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND WE'LL DIVE DEEPER INTO THAT AS WE GET INTO THE REPORT- OVER A TEN YEAR HISTORY WE'VE USED THE TOOLS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN OUR STATE AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION. TO PURSUE OUR MISSION WHICH IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ENSURE CALIFORNIANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY LOWER COSTS REDUCE% AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES BY BEING AN INNOVATIVE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE AND EMPOWERING OUR CONSUMERS TO CHOOSE PLANS AND PROVIDERS TO GIVE THEM THE BEST VALUE. AND THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE BEEN- EXCITING FOR US AS STATE AND FEDERAL ACTION HAS BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT KERN ROWLEY'S TO HELP THEM AFFORD COVERAGE. AND WE ARE PROUD IN TWENTY TWENTY TO IMPLEMENT THE NATION'S LEADING CALIFORNIA PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM ALSO A BACKGROUND IN YOUR AGENDA. THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO PROVIDE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES TO MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND IN THE LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN THE RECESSION THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FEDERAL PREMIUM SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS UP IN THE COVER CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE AND SIGNIFICANTLY REMOVED THAT PREMIUM REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME. ENROLLEES AND REMOVE THE INCOME CAP THAT PREVIOUSLY BARRED MIDDLE INCOME ENROLLEES FROM ACCESSING FEDERAL PREMIUM SUPPORT AND WITH ALL OF THIS A SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABILITY- OUR ENROLLMENT HAS PUSHED TO RECORD LEVELS WERE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. OF ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN RALEIGH'S IN OUR PROGRAM THIS IS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AT ENROLLEES ARE HIGHER THAN AT THE START OF. TWENTY TWENTY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. MANAGER I THINK THE PROBABLY ISN'T PLACE FOR US TO MOVE TO ISSUE TO START ADDITION MICE IF WE CAN GET THAT LINK TO ME YOU PROMISED AT THE BEGINNING WE WANT TO SEE THE SLIDES. THEY ARE DONE AS IS THE REPORT BUT I PROMISE YOU SEE THE HIGHLIGHTS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. I WILL CALL THEM BACK NOW AGENDA WELL TRAINS- SOME OF THE FEDERAL UNCERTAINTY AND THAT'S STILL NEED POLICY ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW SO YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN. BETWEEN COVER CALIFORNIA LEGISLATION ADMINISTRATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS THIS WEEK HAVE THAT CERTAINTY MORE CERTAINTY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SO I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FEDERAL PREMIUM SUPPORT. THEY CAME IN WITH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN BUT DESPITE THAT IMPROVE PREMIUM SUPPORT WE HAVEN'T REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE O CARSHARING SUPPORTED STILL LIMITED TO OUR LOWEST INCOME ENROLLEES. REALLY THE BULK OF THE SUBSIDY BECAUSE GENITALS FOR UNDER TWO HUNDRED. LEVEL AND THEN SOME LIMITED SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS UP LEVEL THE SLIGHTEST OBVIOUSLY DATED DENSO JUST HIGHLIGHTS. AND SOME OF THE EFFECTS THAT ARE ENROLLEES FEEL AS THAT FEDERAL SUPPORT DECREASES. AND DEDUCTIBLES THAT THE EXPERIENCE FOR IN PATIENT CARE RISE PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY WERE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE DEDUCTIBLES LIMITED TO IN PATIENT CARE- BY THE RISE FROM. SORT OF MODEST LEVEL OF SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS UP TO THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AS INCOME. INCREASES AND THAT'S FEDERAL SUPPORTS DISAPPEAR SIMILARLY ON THE CAPS THAT LIMIT ARE YOUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IN THE YEAR. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY HITTING SOME OF THOSE COPAYS AND SERVICE AS A PRIMARY CARE FOR GENERIC DRUGS. SO I DEFINITELY IMPACTS. OUR ENROLLEES AND THEIR CHOICES AND HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SORT OF OUTCOME OF NASH AND- THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OFFERS A VARIETY OF COVERAGE LEVELS WE CALL THEM THE OLYMPIC MEDAL TEARS THEY RANGE FROM BRONZE TO PLATINUM- AS THE NAMING CONVENTION IMPLIES THOSE GO FROM- LOW GENEROSITY HIGH GENEROSITY IF YOU'RE IN A BRONZE PLAN IN VERY LOW MONTHLY PREMIUM. BUT SIGNIFICANT COST SHARING OR DEDUCTIBLES AND ARE PROBLEMS PLAN. AT SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL A DOUBLE FOR A FAMILY SO AS THOSE FEDERAL SUPPORTS DISAPPEAR FOR COST SHARING. OUR ENROLLEES ARE CHOOSE BRONZE AT A SIGNIFICANTLY. HIGHER SHARE AND THEN WE HAVE THAT WE HEARD SOME DATA STATEWIDE DATA FROM DIRECTOR LANDS BURKE ON. THE IMPACTS OF ENROLLEES FEELING AFFORDABILITY IN TELLING CARE JUST A DATA POINT IN THIS SLIDE. TOMORROW NUMBER DATA ABOUT OUR ENROLLEES WERE ENROLLED IN IN BRONZE AT REPORTING DELAYING CARE AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF OUR ENROLLEES WHO ARE AND OUR MOST GENEROUS PLAN. ON ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS COME WITH THEIR OWN WONKY TERMS SHOW OVER NINETY FOUR IS OUR MOST GENEROUS PLAN THAT'S FOR OUR OUR LOWEST INCOME ENROLLEES PROVIDES THEM AS A VERY STRONG OUT OF POCKET COST SHARING SUPPORT. DO YOU SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS ARE IN AFFORDABILITY FOR OUR MEMBERS THIS WITH THAT I THINK THE POLICY LANDSCAPE. THAT LED THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK US TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE IN DEPTH. AND SO WE DID RELEASE- BRINGING CARE WITHIN REACH. APOLOGIES FOR THE BABY PICTURE THAT WE PUT ON THE SIDE OF THE COVER THE REPORT- BUT THIS PROVIDE SPECIFIC OPTIONS FOR HOW WE CAN USE OR OTHER STATES COULD YOU STATE FUNDING FOR FEDERAL FUNDING. AND TO EXPAND CARSHARING SUPPORT WE ALSO RELEASED A SHORTER ISSUE BRIEF AND VERY DETAILED ANALYSIS BY OUR ACTUARIES WHO SUPPORTED US IN THIS PARK. AND WE WERE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE BEEN PUT AN ENGAGEMENT FROM A RANGE OF STAKEHOLDER PARTNERS. AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND AGAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT THE STATE BUDGET ACT IN THE TRAILER BILL FROM LAST YEAR- SO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ASK FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THE BILL BACK BETTER ACT OR A SIMILAR FEDERAL POLICY WOULD EXTEND THOSE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN PREMIUM SUBSIDIES THAT ARE IN EFFECT FOR THIS CALENDAR YEAR. WE DO THAT THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THE SUBSIDIES THAT HELP LIKE I SAID HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT. AND THIS THAT HOUSE PASSED VERSION OF BUILD BACK BETTER WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH AFFORDABILITY. THAT WOULD PROVIDE TEN BILLION PER YEAR FOR EACH YEAR THREE YEARS ON THE SLIDE. IT WOULD ALLOW STATES TO ROUTE TO LOWER THE COST SHARING- AND PREMIUMS- SO VERY SIMILAR TO THE CONCEPT THAT WAS INCLUDED- WHEN THE STATE PUT AWAY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION IN THE STATE AFFORDABILITY FUND FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND SO THAT'S THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL POLICY LANDSCAPE. AND GIVEN THAT OUR REORT FRAME SORT OF THREE SCENARIOS- ONE- OF. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SUBSIDIES EXPIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THERE'S NO FEDERAL ACTION TO EXTEND THEM. AND THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY GIVE THE STATE TRADE OFFS IN TERMS OF. HOW TO SPEND THE AFFORDABILITY MONEY TO LOOK AT CAR SHARING A TO LOOK AT. AND WE LOOK AT THE STATE PREMIUM SUPPORT PROGRAM. THE NEXT OPTION IS THAT AND BUILD BACK BETTER IN CONCEPT THIS STUNNING PREMIUM SUBSIDIES IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SUPPORTS WE HAVE SOME OPTIONS THERE. AND THEN LASTLY AND THIS WAS REALLY WHERE WE GET MOST OF OUR WORK THIS IS I THINK WHAT WAS ANTICIPATED WHEN THEY'RE OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE- A. R. P. PREMIUM SUBSIDIES ARE EXTENDED SO WE HAVE THAT. MUCH MORE GENEROUS PREMIUM SUPPORT WE USED THE STATE FUNDING TO COMPLEMENT THAT AND REDUCE COSTS AND SO THOSE ARE. THE THREE SCENARIOS. WE FRAME WORK. I WON'T BELABOR THIS. WE ARE DEFINITELY WORKING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT ALL OF THE FACTS. ARE VERY CLEAR ASHER PUBLIC AND POLICY MAKERS ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD NEED A CLEAN LISTING AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN PREMIUM SUBSIDIES. I'M JUST A HIGH LEVEL OF HE DATA POINTS HERE. ON AVERAGE OUR ENROLLEES WITH NEWS ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD PER MONTH. AND IT WOULD BE A TOTAL ANNUAL IMPACT OF ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN PREMIUM SUBSIDIES. AND THE REPORT BREAKS DOWN- THAT- THE POTENTIAL LOSSES. ACROSS OUR INCOME GROUPS AND JUSTICE BACKGROUND IF WE NEED TO TURN TO THIS AND THINK ABOUT. POTENTIALLY AT RESTORING ESTATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM IN SOME FORM OR FASHION. BUT I WILL MOVE TO THE NEXT SCENARIO WHICH IS REALLY. WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE CAR SHARING POTENTIAL QUESTIONING SUPPORT. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS JAM PACKED WITH DATA I DON'T WANT TO WALK YOU SERVICE FOLLOWING HIGHLIGHTED YOU THINGS. THE MAIN EXHIBIT IN THE REPORT. WHAT WE TRIED TO DO HERE pDIFFERENCES ON THE OPTIONS ARE THAT CAN BE HELPFUL. AND AS YOU DIG INTO THEIR AND YOUR TEAMS TO THINK ABOUT. A POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE FEDERAL FUNDING SLIDES OF THE DOLLAR AND THE COST. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE HIGHER. AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. RESEARCH NOW. AND I'LL JUST ON THAT TOP ROW IT'S OUR MOST GENEROUS OPTION. WE ACTUALLY PULLED IT FROM SOME MODELING THAT WAS DON AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BY RESEARCHERS AT THE URBAN INSTITUTE AS THEY WERE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL AND NATIONAL PROGRAMS TO EXPAND CARSHARING SUPPORT MARKET PLACES. AND THIS IS THE ONE OPTION WE MODEL THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT TO MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS UP LEVEL. AND THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A PRAIRIE STATE WANTED THE PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT TO MIDDLE INCOME. AND PUT ASIDE FROM THAT- I WOULD NOTE THAT SHE THINGS- DEFINITELY. UPGRADE CARSHARING SUPPORT WE HAVE OVER A MILLION INDIVIDUALS. AND UNDER 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL ELIGIBLE FOR SUPPORT TODAY. I'M SO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN UPGRADING. THEIR AFFORDABILITY- WE DREW FROM THE STATUTE WHICH DEFINITELY ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF DEDUCTIBLES AND WE WOULD USE THIS FUNDING TO ELIMINATE DEDUCTIBLES IN THE PLANS THAT PROVIDE DISCUSSION SUPPORT. AND AS YOU SEE THE NINETY FIVE NINETY FIVE EIGHTY. M. THOSE ARE- SORT OF OUR REFERENCE POINT FOR GENEROSITY THE PLAN A 95% PLAN WOULD PAY ON AVERAGE 95% OF THAT PERSON'S AVERAGE EXPECTED COST WHAT IS NOT MEAN TARGETS IS THE ABILITY TO OFFER BENEFIT PACKAGES. THEY GIVE YOU A FIVE DOLLAR PRIMARY CARE VISIT OUR THREE DOLLAR GENERIC DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS SO AND THIS WOULD ALL GET-TRANSLATED INTO BENEFIT DESIGNS AND THAT LOOK MORE FAMILIAR WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY VISIT COSTS BUT. AS A PRIMARY CARE VISIT COST. ON TO THIS REPORT. WE DID ROLL UP TO THE AGGREGATE SO I'M GETTING MEMBERS. UP TO A VERY GENEROUS COVERAGE LEVELS. SO THAT'S- SORT OF A SOME OF THE WAY WE FRAME THE POLICY HERE AND SOME OF THAT- THE WASTE COMPARE OPTIONS. I'LL PAUSE OWNER- SHE NEREO THREE THIS IS. LAW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. EXTENDS PREMIUM SUPPORT AMONG THE STATE LOOKS TO ENHANCE CARSHARING SUPPORT WE OFFER FOUR OPTIONS IN YOUR REPORT- DRAWN LARGELY FROM THE STATUTE. IN MOST OF THESE OPTIONS TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS UP 24100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL CAN HAVE CAR SHARING SUPPORT. AT LEAST THE GOLD LEVEL SO PLAN PAYING ON AVERAGE. IN THAT TOP ROW THAT MOST GENEROUS YOU'D BE MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND TO REDUCE COST SHARING FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TODAY FOR FEDERAL SUPPORT. AND SO WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS. AND THEN OFFER BRAND NEW SUPPORT TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ABOVE POVERTY LEVEL. TO PROVIDE THEM QUESTIONING SUPPORT FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND AGAIN ALSO ELIMINATING DEDUCTIBLES. ALL OPTION FIVE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAT WOULD JUST FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS WERE ELIGIBLE TODAY AND PROVIDE THEM AN UPGRADE. AND YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THAT LOOKS KIND OF EXPENSIVE- CONSIDERING THAT IT IT DOESN'T EXPAND A LEGIBILITY. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE HAVE- AND QUITE A FEW ENROLLEES IN THAT INCOME RANGE SO YOU'D BE INVESTING IN. A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE JUST ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUPPORT DAY- STEPPING DOWN ONE A LITTLE BIT LESS ANA. UPGRADE FOR EXISTING ELIGIBLES THAT WOULD REALLY FOCUS ON EXPANDING THAT BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TODAY- AND THEN WE DID IT BECAUSE OF THE EMPHASIS STATUTE IN THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE IMPACT. AND DEDUCTIBLES MAY PLAY IN DETERRING BY DETERRING FOLKS FROM SIGNING UP. FOR DETERRING THEM FROM USING IT CARE WANTS TO SIGN UP. WE DID PROVIDE JUST AN ISOLATED OPTION THAT SAYS WHAT IF WE JUST USE FUNDS. TO ELIMINATE DEDUCTIBLES IN OUR- IN OUR COST SHARING REDUCTION PLANS SO THAT NOBODY IN THIS PLANT HAS TO WORRY ABOUT HAVING A DEDUCTIBLE FOR ANY SERVICES. AND IN THAT CONNECTION. AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN SOME OF OUR OTHER OPTIONS. AND NOT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A WORD ABOUT THE RANGE OF COSTS HERE- THESE COSTS WOULD VARY BASED ON OUR EXISTING ENROLLEES. MOVING FROM THE PLANS THAT THEY'RE IN SOME OF THOSE OLYMPIC MEDAL TIERS BRONZE GOLD AND PLATINUM. INTO THE SILVER PLANS WHERE WE OFFER THESE COST SHARING REDUCTIONS SO IT WOULD REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE PLANS- COVER CALIFORNIA TO DO OUTREACH- AND ALSO. I THINK PASSED TO- I DO SOME WORK WITH OUR YOU IN ROLE USED TO GET THEM INTO THOSE SOBRE PLANS TAKE ADVANTAGE THAT. THANKS A LOT THE RANGE OF CARS YOU SEEN TRULY. AND EXISTING IN. AND TRYING TO GET THEM INTO PLANS THAT WOULD GIVE THEM EACH OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE. OUR LAST SUBSTANCE FLIGHT HERE CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION ON TIGHTENING WE DID APPRECIATE THE MARGINAL STATUTE TO D. DELVE DEEPLY INTO OPERATIONS I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE DETAIL HERE. BUT WE DID DO THAT HAS A VERY GOOD DISCUSSIONS I THINK- THAT GIVEN US. A GOOD HEAD START ON PLANNING HERE OBVIOUSLY IF WE TRY TO LAUNCH A PROGRAM FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD TO COMPRESSED TIME FRAME AND WILL NEED A LOT OF DECISIONS. IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE CALENDAR YEAR- THAT SAID WE THAT WE KNOW THAT WE WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE FEDERAL UNCERTAINTY SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO- PROVIDE OPTIONS ARE FINE OPTIONS AS WE GET MORE CLARITY ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING. AND BUT WE WILL BE WORKING IN THE- I'M ON OUR SIDE- TO DO AS MUCH PREPARATION AS WE CAN SO THAT IF WE DO HAVE. AND FEDERAL FUNDING YOU CAN MOVE QUICKLY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT- AND IF WE DON'T WE CAN BE READY. FOR POTENTIAL STATE OPTIONS. BUT THAT'LL STOP THE SLIDES WILL. TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WOULD NOTE TO THE PUB THAT WE- MAKE SURE WE LIST THOSE SLIDES BECAUSE SINCE IT WAS OF MUCH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEEN- PUT PUT UP ON THE WEBSITE- BY APPRECIATE. YOUR PRESENTATION AND I THINK- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY HOPE THE FEDS ARE ABLE TO HELP OUT. BUT I KNOW FROM FOR ME AND I KNOW THE PRO TEM AND I SERRANO THE BUDGET CHAIR. WE HAVE A- THE- BIG EMPHASIS. ON REDUCING POVERTY AND HELPING AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SO. I CAN SEE IS. IF WE NEED TO DO. MOVING VERY QUICKLY TO BE ABLE TO. HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WE DO NOT WANT THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. TO BE SOMETHING THAT KEEPS PEOPLE. FROM MAKING SURE THEY GET THAT PREVENTIVE CARE- AND THEIR DAILY NEEDS DONE SO IT DOESN'T COST US. WAY MORE ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO I APPRECIATE- IRAQ IS LIGHT AND THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THIS. AND THAT HOPEFULLY IT MEANS YOU CAN BE WE CAN BE READY TO ROLL AS SOON AS WE NEED TO- AND- THEN WE CERTAINLY COMMITTEE THAT WILL BE WORKING- THE FACTORY SO WE CAN MAKE SOME DECISIONS AS SOON AS WE NEED TO MAKE THEM. LOOK BETTER YOU CAN CHECK. I DO HAVE SEVERAL. MISHAPS WE CAN HEAVILY- ELEMENT ASK THIS. W. MOREOVER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A MORE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS IN THE COMING WEEKS BUT I DID WANT TO RAISE A FEW ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION NOT ALL FORCE OBVIOUSLY IS THAT IT'S ABOUT OFFERING SERVICES SOME OF THESE ARE NOT EXTENDED WOULD MOST LIKELY BE THE MOST IMPACTFUL WAY- OF. IMPACTING AFFORDABILITY- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT FEDERAL SUBSIDIES ARE CONTINUED I AM CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS ARE FEW THINGS A LOGICAL WHEN YOU CONSIDER FIRST IS- WHAT THEY CALL ON- I DRESS IN. INCOME IT WOULDN'T BE AN WHAT THE WILL THE ON WITH THOSE GOALS. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE GOAL IS TO PROMOTE FOR ILLEGAL IT CAN BECOME CONSUMERS FOCUSING ON APPROACHES THAT TARGET. CONSUMERS WITH INCOMES BELOW LEVEL MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE. WHAT IF THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE ABILITY FOR THE BUT THE TWO AND DOES NOT CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE TOTAL COSTS AND REDUCTIONS. ON THE SIDE TO SOME OF THE ONES MOST LIKELY TO ENROLL IN THE BRONZE KINDS CURRENTLY A DIFFERENT APPROACH MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE AND THEN FINALLY THE BATTLE COULD BE TO DRIVE NEW ENROLLMENT FOR THE SHIFT IN ROLE IS TO MORE- GENEROUS. PLANS NEXT FAILED. WEATHER THAN TOP THE TIME FRAME IS FOR THE- OF PROGRAM. SO THE CHILDREN COULD CONSIDER- A ONE TIME PROGRAM. TO FOR HIM OR SOMETHING GONNA GO. WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO PROGRAM ARTISTIC LIST RESEARCH. BUT NO. FOR BUT EXTRACTION THE MEASURE COST TO IMPLEMENT THAT PLAN AND COMMUNICATE THE PROGRAM TO POTENTIAL. CONSUMERS- WHEN THE LARGER SAME ALLEN TALKING FOR COMPARE ON PROBE. AT ALL RESULT IN A INJURY. FOR WHICH CAUSE COULD COULD BENEFIT FOR THE PLAN OR EVEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT MY ROLLING INTO IT. GOING TO BE WHAT LEVEL OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ADDITIONAL COSTS IN THE REDUCTIONS COULD FIND ASSISTANCE WITH PAYING FOR THESE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS THERE'S ALSO A ONE TIME FUNDING OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SENATE SIGNED. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT COULD BE EXTENDED I WANNA LET YOU TURN BASIS OR IN THE FUTURE LEADERS AND THEN FINDING THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER A- APPROVING ADDITIONAL. GENERAL FUND REVENUE TO PROVIDE. SO FOR THESE FOR A- AND THEN FINALLY- WILL NOT AROUND TYPE OF KHASHOGGI TARGET THE OPTIONS AND REPORT GENERALLY FOCUS ON ELIMINATING OR REDUCING DEDUCTIBLES OR MOVING CONSUMERS ENGINE ONE GENEROUS PLANS CAN IMPACT POSSIBLE TO ALWAYS INCLUDE THE DEDUCTIBLES. AND THE MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. THE MOST OF THE PLAN OPTIONS THE BORDER INVOLVED NOT MOVE A LOT OF TROUBLES. IN THIS ORDER IN HOLLAND IN PATIENT CARE- I. JOHNSON WHERE THE GENITALS OF HIGH. END COVERED CALIFORNIA. I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH NOT MUCH PAY CARE OF BENEFIT TO FROM THE READ OR A DOUBLE HOWEVER THAT IF YOU DO. A CARE CAN AND PAYING VERY HIGH CALL. AS A RESULT OF THESE DOCTORS AND IN ADDITION TO CONSUMERS PERCEIVED COSTA DOUBLES CAN BE A DETERRENT TO ENROLLING PLANS OR SEEKING CARE INCLUDING SERVICE FOR SERVICE'S SADDAM DID. NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO DOUBLE. IT ALSO IS COSTLY THAN OTHER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT WOULD NOT. REQUIRE THE FULL ELIMINATION OF DEDUCTIBLES. THERE'S ONLY ONE OPTION IN THE REPORT THAT. WOULD MAINTAIN DEDUCTIBLES THAT WOULD SHIP CONSUMERS INTO THE MORE GENEROUS PLAN WHICH WOULD WE GENERALLY WE DO TO DOUBLE THE ORDER CALDERON MARKETING EXPENSES BUT THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO PAY SOME CHARITABLE. THIS WOULD SUBJECT TO LOWER COSTS OF IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY ON THE LEVEL OF BENEFIT IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY THAT THE OPTIONS ARE REMOVED HOLES WOULD HAVE. BEEN K. BERMAN FINANCING HAVE ANYTHING. BURKE OTHER CORPORATE APARTMENT OF FINANCE. ONLY THE OTHER THE ADMINISTRATION IS IN THE PROCESS OF EXAMINING THE OPTIONS PROVIDED IN THE REPORT AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE FEDERAL SITUATION- AND WILL BE DEVELOPING AN OPTIONS DEPENDING ON THE FEDERAL ACTIONS PAM. THANK YOU. AND AGAIN PRECIADO THE PRESENTATION AND THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS- GUESS. WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE ALSO SHOULD BE CONSIDERING IS THAT- BECAUSE ABILITY OF THE MARKET RATE AND SO COVER CALIFORNIA'S AN ACTIVE PURCHASER- IT'S NEGOTIATING THE RATES. AND THE MORE UNCERTAINTY THERE IS- USUALLY THE MORE EXPENSIVE THINGS KEPT HER EIGHT BECAUSE EACH OF THE PLANS HAS TO BACON THE UNCERTAINTY INTO THEIR RATES AND OF COURSE IF THERE'S MORE UNCERTAINTY YOU'RE GOING TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS AND- SO I. THINK THAT- YEAH WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT- I ALSO WAY TALK ABOUT STABILITY. I THINK WOULD BE CHALLENGING FOR EXAMPLE TO PUT. FUNDS IN ON ONE YEAR AND THEN NOT HAVE THE FUNDS THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND THEN PULL BACK ALL RIGHT SO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO PRECIADO THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW WE CAN WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO BUILD BACK BETTER WEATHER SOME COMPONENT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT SAFE PASSES A BILL THAT BETTER WITH ONLY ONE YEAR ADDITIONAL TO THAT. AND SO I THINK WE ALWAYS NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S OUR STATE CAPACITY I MEAN UNLESS DAY ACTUALLY PASS SOMETHING SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE OF THESE YOU KNOW OUT FOR. FOREVER OR AT LEAST FOR YOU KNOW SO MANY MANY YEARS- SO THAT IT'S FARTHER ON THE HORIZON. I GUESS I WOULD URGE SOME CAUTION IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE'RE GOING TO. COMMIT STATE RESOURCES TO MAKE UP FOR. AS MUCH AS WE CAN. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF. THE PROGRAM ENDS AND DOESN'T GET FUNDED SELLERS WHY DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW GO IN COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND THEN WERE YANKING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM BECAUSE SUDDENLY TO PREMIUMS SPIKE RATE AND- YOU CAN YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN TERMS OF. PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN. THE NEWS REPORTS RIGHT THE COVERAGE I MEAN THE GREAT NEWS IS WE CAN NOW TELL PEOPLE WHAT COVERED CALIFORNIA PREMIUMS ACTUALLY HAVE STAYED. STABLE INTACT THAT'S BEEN UNDER 1% FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ETCETERA THAT'S A GREAT STORY. SO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT STORY IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO THE FEWER SWINGS WE HAVE SO WHAT IS I GUESS WHEN THE QUESTIONS I HAVE. YOU KNOW THE HAVE THE ANSWER NOT FOR RECOVERY CALIFORNIA IS THAT- YOU KNOW WHAT THE I GUESS FOR THESE OPTIONS AND I GUESS YOU GOT THREE JOBS AND SO FORTH BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE THING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE MOST STABILITY IN THE MARKET WOULD THAT THAT WOULD GIVE COVER CALIFORNIA MOST ADVANTAGEOUS NEGOTIATING POSITION LET'S SAY ASSUMING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T. PASS BUILD BACK BETTER. I MEAN I'M I'M CERTAINLY HOPING THEY WILL RELEASE THIS COMPONENT OF IT YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY HOPING PASSABLE BACK BETTER ALL TOGETHER BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. YOU KNOW IT'S A THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT THIS PREDICAMENT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND I WOULD THINK THAT IF YOU DON'T PASS IT BY THE TIME WE PASS OUR BUDGET I DON'T THINK IT'S HAPPENING IT'S ELECTION YEAR. BUT WHAT WOULD DO WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY POSE IN THE BEST POSITION WHEN IT COMES TO. NEGOTIATING WITH THE PLANS AND KNOWING THE PLANS KNOWING THAT OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD WE KNOW WHAT THE CASE MIX WILL BE RIGHT BECAUSE OF THEIR SHIFTING THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CASE MIX THINGS THAT HAPPENED AS WELL. SO IT WAS HOW IS THAT FACTORED IN INTO THE REPORT AND- WHAT. WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. AT ANY THE LOSS OF PREMIUM SUBSIDIES- HOW CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS WOULD FEEL THAT WHEN THEY- GET THOSE RENEWAL LETTERS IN OCTOBER OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT. INCREASES IN OUR PLANS LOOKING AT- ICING FOR THAT UNCERTAINTY WILL THOSE CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN ADDED ON TO THE A. R. P. PREMIUM SUBSIDIES AND DROP- SO I THINK- LOOKING AT AT STEEP PREMIUMS SUBSIDIES. IN SOME FASHION- IS PROBABLY THE THING THAT WOULD- ABI FOCUSED ON MARKET STABILITY THE MOST- ARE ENROLLEES THE BULK OF OUR ENROLLEES ARE ON THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE SO WE DO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT WE PROVIDE THOSE. INCREMENTS IN THE REPORTS THAT YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE COST WOULD BE TO DO THAT BACK FILLED BY INCOME GROUPS AND THAT THE BUT AGAIN AS THE L. A. O. MENTION. COULD START TO THINK ABOUT PRIORITIES BY INCOME GROUPS AND BEEN AND WHERE THE BULK OF OUR ENROLLEES ARE. THE SORT OF CUSHION NINE LOS GENERAL TENT CITIES. AND ADDRESSING THE UNCERTAINTY THAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO BUY OR ACTUALLY FOR EXAMPLE THE LOSS OF THE SUBSIDIES ARE BIGGEST IMPACT ACTION THE HIGHER INCOME GROUP BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY ONCE YOU HAD OVER FOUR HUNDRED SO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE- AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. PEOPLE BEYOND 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHICH BY THE WAY OF COURSE IS THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING. WE'RE NOT TALKING TO PEOPLE MAKING NESTLE THAT MUCH MONEY WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THIS OF THE ALTOGETHER SO WHO KNOWS ALL THE PEOPLE YOU PICKED UP ABOVE 4100% PART IN FACT WHEN WE PREVIOUSLY DID OUR STATE SUBSIDY WE DID. RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE PROVIDE SUBSIDIES FOR FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED. BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE OUT THERE. WHO I MEAN I GOT REALLY EXPENSIVE THEY GOT NO SUB ZERO YOU YOU HIS AND HE HAD A CLASS RIGHT SO YOU KNOW YOU HAD SOME SUBSIDY AND THEN HIT 4100% FIVE. FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL EASTENDERS BASICALLY GOT NOTHING SO WE SAID OKAY WE'RE GONNA PUT A STATE SUBSIDY. I KNOWS YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE IDEA OF SAYING WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS THE MONEY ON THE POOREST. BUT I THINK THAT WAS ALSO PART OF TRYING TO CREATE A LARGER MARKET. PLACE AS WELL AS AVAILABILITY THAT ABSOLUTE DENTAL I THINK CONTRIBUTED TO THE BILLETE PARA CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY HAVE KEEP THE LOWER PREMIUMS WHICH BY THE WAY ALSO HELPS. OVERALL IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO PUT IN FOR SUBSIDIES IN WE CAN KEEP THE PREMIUM AMOUNTS- LOWER. IN YOUR NEGOTIATION CORRECT. ABSOLUTELY IN. MEANS IN SPEECH THERE- DEFINITELY THOSE ARE PEOPLE. SUBSIDIES ARE HIGH. FOR THOSE HIGHER INCOME GROUPS. AND IT'S ONE OF OUR LOWEST GROUPS BY NUMBER THE NINETEEN ROWLEY'S SO. AN BIGGER NUMBERS OF ENROLLEES AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE BUT AGAIN AND THEY WILL SEE SMALLER LOSSES AFFAIR. WELL- SO THAT'S PART OF THE TRADE ON SO THE CONDENSATES AT THE MARGINS RIGHT. WORK THINGS GET A MOST AFFECTED SO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO WILL GET AFFECTED THE MOST AT THE MARGINS WITH THE. ELIMINATION OF THE A. R. P. AND WHAT DO WE DO WITH STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES. ARE OTHER SUBSIDIES RIGHT TO TRY TO. POLICE PROTECT. TO MAINTAIN ENOUGH OF A MARGIN THAT WOULD NOT. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR PREMIUM AND THAT YOU KNOW- ADVANTAGE IN NEGOTIATION AS WELL RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THE DYNAMIC WE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT GREAT BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE PREMIUMS GO UP THAT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT. YOUR AFFECTS EVERYBODY CORRECT. BUT DOES THAT'LL TAX ON AND THE OFF EXCHANGE MARKET AS WELL AND WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THAT NOW AS WE PREPARE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING BACK CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS AS A R. P. PREMIUM SUBSIDIES EXPIRING. SO I SAW SO I THINK INTO IN TERMS OF THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. YOU KNOW WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT'S WHATEVER WE PROPOSE A SUBSIDY SPECIALLY IF. WELL TEN FORTY RIGHT NOW IT'S WELL HOPEFULLY STILL S. BUT- WE DON'T HAVE ANY FOR YOU KNOW THE AARP GOES AWAY ENSURE THAT- WE- MAXIMIZE ACCESS WHICH ALSO INCLUDES. BETTER STABILIZATION THE MARKET WHICH INCLUDES GIVING COVERED CALIFORNIA THE BEST LEVERAGE FOR YOUR ACTIVE NEGOTIATION WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE SUMMER AFTER WE PASSED THE BUDGET RIGHT BECAUSE YOU GO TO THE HEALTH PLANS AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAYING OKAY HEALTH PLANS WERE THE PREMIUM IS GOING TO BE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE NEGOTIATING WITH YOU ON THAT AND SO BECAUSE THOSE PREMIUMS WILL BE WHAT'S- YOU KNOW. CONGO CROSS THE BOARD SO- SO ANYWAY I DO SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WELL I MEAN I SER BELIEVE ME I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE MORE. THAN A DEDUCTIBLES ALL THAT STUFF AND- YOU KNOW I'M JUST I'M NOT SAYING OPPOSED TO THAT BUT I ALSO BE SURE WE'RE ALSO CONSIDERING. WHAT MOVES WE MAKE THAT WOULD ALSO ENSURE WE HAVE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE PREMIUMS BECAUSE THAT WAY WE'RE NOT HAVING TO SUBSIDIZE THEIR HOMES. BECAUSE OF LOOKING AT THE PLANS. TO KEEP THE PREMIUMS LOWER. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE CASE MIX IS GOING TO BE. BETTER THAN THAT THAN WHAT I THINK WERE EVERYONE'S BETTER OFF. THAN MY WRONG. BROWN OKAY ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU AND THEN I GUESS WE DECIDE TO DO I JUST WANT ONE OTHER REMARK- IN A AND AGAIN APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK COVER CALIFORNIA'S DONE AND- IT'S AN AMAZING GROUP BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN I CHAIRED THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT COMMITTEE ONE OF THE THINGS. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OVERSEE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S A PLACE YOU KNOW HE'S GOT REQUEST FOR WERE. EXEMPTED POSITIONSSO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET PAID YOU KNOW HOW THE CIVIL SERVICE PAY SCALE. THE END OF THOSE PUSH BACK ON THAT. YOU KNOW AFTER ALL WE HAVE TO DEAL TALK ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY AND SO FORTH AND- SOMETIMES YOU'LL TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH CEOS MAY CONSIDER A- AND THE HEALTH OF THAT DISPARITY. AND SO CERTAINLY STATE SERVICE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SO COMPETITIVE. WITH THE PRIVATE MARKET- BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF MY THINGS THAT THAT I JUST ALSO WANTED TO TOUCH ON IS THAT. CALIFORNIA'S NOTED THAT THE INCOME COMES FROM TAXES ON PREMIUMS ESSENTIALLY. AND YOU KNOW I THINK I UNDERSTAND OR SEVERAL EXEMPTS DITIONS. IN IN IN IN THE ORGANIZATION. AND SO DID I THINK THERE IS YOU KNOW- WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT- IT'S NOT SET BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE'RE- HERE TALKING ABOUT SUBSIDIES FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND CERTAINLY WE'RE DOING FOR THE DAY- BENEFICIARIES BUT- BE SURE THAT PAY SCALES ARE NOT. YOU KNOW EXCESSIVE. IN ANY ORGANIZATION IN THE STATE. SO.
