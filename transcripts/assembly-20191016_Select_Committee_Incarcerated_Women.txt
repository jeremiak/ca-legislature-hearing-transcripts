EVERYONE SO I WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU ALL TO OUR FIRST HEARING FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INCARCERATED WOMEN AND I WANT TO EXTEND A SINCERE THANK YOU TO THE BED CHIU BY TEMPLE FOR HOSTING AND TO ALL OF OUR- PANEL BICKERS OUR WARRIOR WOMEN. FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF THEIR ADVOCACY EFFORTS TO BE WITH US. BEFORE I GET STARTED WITH MY REMARKS I DO JUST WANT TO CALL OUT I TIANA JEFFERSON I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY HER NAME. BECAUSE THIS REALLY IS A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WOMEN HOWEVER WE SELF IDENTIFY AS WOMEN ARE UNDERVALUED OUR- DISCARDED AND ARE MARGINALIZED BY A SYSTEM NOT DESIGNED TO LOVE EMBRACE AND HEAL US SO. SHE WAS KILLED BOTH UNCEREMONIOUSLY AND WITHOUT FAVOR AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY HER NAME. IT'S NO SECRET THAT OUR NATION IS FACING A MASS INCARCERATION EPIDEMIC. IF THE PRISON POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES WERE A CITY IT WOULD BE AMONG THE COUNTRY'S TENTH LARGEST. THE UNITED STATES SPENDS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS WITH A B. EACH YEAR ON CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES ALONE A NUMBER MADE EVEN MORE ALARMING WHEN COMPARED TO THE SIXTY EIGHT BILLION DISCRETIONARY BUDGET OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALONE WE SPENT NEARLY THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON STATE CORRECTIONS EXPENDITURES. THOUGH MOST NATIONAL DISCOURSE AROUND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM CENTERS ON THE FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEM THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE HELD IN FACILITIES CONTROLLED BY STATE AND BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. MOST OF US ARE AWARE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK PEOPLE ARE DRAMATICALLY OVER REPRESENTED IN THE NATION'S PRISONS AND JAILS WHAT MANY MAY NOT KNOW HOWEVER IS THAT THOSE SAME DISPARITIES ARE EXACERBATED FOR WOMEN. WHOSE RATE OF INCARCERATION HAS BEEN RISING FASTER THAN THAT OF MEN FOR DECADES. SEVERAL STATES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO DECREASE THEIR PRISON POPULATION AND WHILE THE INTENTION IS GOOD THESE STEPS OFTEN FOCUS MORE DIRECTLY ON MALE PRISON POPULATIONS WHILE THE NUMBER OF MEN AND STATE FACILITIES HAS DECREASED THE NUMBER OF WOMEN HAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE LEE INCREASED. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT CALIFORNIA IS AMONG ONE OF THE FOURTEEN STATES WHERE CHANGES IN WOMEN'S INCARCERATION ARE ACTUALLY SLOWING THE GROWTH OF STATE PARK PRISON POPULATIONS AND SOMETIMES EVEN DRIVING DE CAR SERRATION ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVE. BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY CHANCE THE SHIFT TOWARDS THE D. KERR SERRATION OF WOMEN HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY VOICES THAT CARE AND BY VOICES WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE STRUGGLE. VOICE IS MUCH LIKE THE ADVOCATES WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM TODAY. FORMALLY INCARCERATED WOMEN AND PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SUCH AS THE JUDGES DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN PUBLIC DEFENDERS. PEOPLE WHO SEE THE GRAVE HARM IN A SOCIETY THAT SPENDS MORE MONEY ON INCARCERATING PEOPLE THAN ON EDUCATING THEM. PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY DREAM OF A MORE JUST SOCIETY BUT TAKE ACTION TO MAKE THAT DREAM A REALITY PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT AS PROGRESSIVE AS CALIFORNIA MAY BE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES. IT IS NOT ENOUGH IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. THE NEED TO REVIEW AND REFORM POLICY SENTENCING AND REHABILITATION PRACTICES FOR INCARCERATED WOMEN IS WHY I DECIDED TO CHAIR THE SELECT COMMITTEE. MY HOPE IS TO BUILD A COALITION FROM ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE TO EXPLORE. PROBE MEASURES TO DECREASE THE RATE WOMEN IN TO SUPPORT THE- DIGNITY AND REHABILITATION OF INCARCERATED WOMEN. SO I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE STAFF BOTH AT BAT SHOOT VÀ AND MY DISTRICT IN MY CAPITAL STAFF FOR HELPING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER THEY ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE ROOM AND HOWARD QUAN WHO'S MY LEGS DIRECTOR IN THE BACK LOOKING AT HIS PHONE TO ISAAC BRIAN OR NEW SENIOR ADVISER HERE IN THE DISTRICT OFFICE BALK HE'S A ONE. THE A LENA EVANS NIKKI JOHNSON I JUST WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT I'M MAKING GARRISON AND I'M I WANT TO BRING UP NOW HERE IT ROSE AT WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF THAT SHOE THAT TO SAY SOME WORDS AND TO WELCOME. US TO THE SPACE SO THING TO HEAR IT THANK YOU. WOOD WE'RE VERY HONORED TO SHARE OUR SPACE IN OUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH INCARCERATED MEN AND WOMEN. THIS IS OUR SANCTUARY WHERE YOU ARE SITTING. AND I'LL TELL YOU JUST VERY BRIEFLY HOW THIS ALL CAME TO BE. I AM A SOCIAL WORKER BY EDUCATION BUT I ALWAYS HAD AN ATTRACTION THE OUTLAWS. AND. YEAH HI I LIKE BAD BOYS BASICALLY AND ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THERE WAS A AN AD IN THE PAPER. FOR A SOCIAL WORKER OF JEWISH BACKGROUND AND CULTURE TO WORK WITH JEWISH CRIMINAL OFFENDERS AND I HOPPED ON THAT AD. WHEN I GOT HIRED AND STARTED GOING OUT TO A COUNTY STATE AND FEDERAL PENAL INSTITUTIONS VISITING INCARCERATED MEN AND WOMEN AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THE COMMUNITY HAD TO OFFER FOR RE ENTRY. AND I GOT REALLY FRUSTRATED AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER AND I SAID WELL SCREW IT I'M GOING TO START MY OWN. AND THERE WAS HOMELESS SHELTER MONEY COMING INTO TOWN ROAD GRANT FOR A HOMELESS SHELTER FOR JEWISH MEN AND WOMEN COMING OUT OF JAILS AND PRISONS AND THE FIRST WOMAN WHO WE EVER ACCEPTED IS SITTING RIGHT HERE CARRY NEWMAN HOW MANY YEARS AGO. TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO AND HE NOW DIRECTS OUR ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING PROGRAM CONTINUING THE MISSION OF OUR REACH TO INCARCERATED PEOPLE SO I'M GLAD THE WORLD HAS CAUGHT UP TO OUR INTEREST IN THIS MISSION BECAUSE IT IS A MISSION. THAT REVOLVING DOOR YOU ALL KNOW IN AND OUT OF PRISON AND THERE NEED TO BE MANY MORE PLACES LIKE THIS WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME AND HE IS IN COMMUNITY AND WE WANT TO BE PART OF THIS EFFORT AND JOIN YOU IN WHATEVER WE CAN. HELP. THE ASK YOU NOT TO BE ON YOUR PHONES AND TO PAY ATTENTION. THANK YOU THERE IT AND RESTROOMS ARE TO MY RIGHT BEHIND AND WE DO ASK THAT YOU PUT YOUR ELECTRONIC DEVICES ON SILENT OR ON VIBRATE. SO THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO GO WE HAVE OUR FIRST PANEL HERE OF WARRIORS. WHO HAVE COME OUT OF THE SYSTEM WE ARE GOING TO START FROM MY FAR LEFT IN WORK TO THE RIGHT ALTHOUGH ALWAYS WE STAY ON THE LEFT. I WILL NOT INTRO DO SPOKES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO STEAL THEIR THUNDER AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE DUPLICATES OF TIME BUT I AM GOING TO. HAVE SOME TF QUESTIONS AND SO MAYBE THESE ARE QUESTIONS YOUR SOARING IN YOUR TESTIMONY OR IF YOU GO FREE STYLE MAYBE THERE QUESTIONS. SECONDS DID YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO HAD BEEN INCARCERATED GROWING UP. WHAT WAS YOUR GUARDIAN SHIP LIKE. DID YOU SUFFER ANY TRAUMAS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE. WHAT WAS THERE A POINT WHEN THE SYSTEM FAILED YOU. WAS INCARCERATION LESS STIGMATIZED OR MORE NORMALIZED. DID YOU GO TO TRIAL WERE YOU OFFERED A PLEA BARGAIN DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAD ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION. DID YOU FEEL PREPARED FOR WHAT INCARCERATION WOULD BE LIKE PRIOR TO YOUR INCARCERATION. DID YOU HAVE ADEQUATE TIME TO INFORM YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND LOVED ONES DID YOUR ARRESTING OFFICER TESTIFY DID YOU FEEL THAT YOU RECEIVED EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. SO FEEL FREE TO ANSWER ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS OR NONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT FOOD FOR THOUGHT SO THANK YOU. YOUR TIME YEAH. AND EVERYONE SHOULD HIT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON SO THAT THE GREEN LIGHT POPS UP GOT IT HI MY NAME IS BRITTANY RICHARDSON I AM AN EMPLOYEE HERE AT BEACH YUBA AND I'M FORMERLY INCARCERATED. I LET ME THINK I DON'T THINK I KNEW ANYBODY THAT WAS INCARCERATED WHEN I WAS GROWING UP WE WERE NOT JAILED PEOPLE MY MOTHER SAID THAT TO ME A COUPLE TIMES WHEN. JAIL WE'RE NOT JUST LIKE ONE ROGUE UNCLE THAT. IT WAS THIS BIG DEAL THAT HE'D BEEN TO JAIL AND THEY LIED ALL THE KIDS AND SAID HE WENT TO COLLEGE FOR LIKE EIGHT YEARS. BUT SO NO I DIDN'T I HAD A VERY. SKEWED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT AND INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL WAS OF WHAT OUR CRIMINAL WAS OF WHAT A DRUG ADDICT WAS. I AM I AM A HEROIN ADDICT AND A DRUG ADDICT I WILL I HAVE ALMOST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OF SOBRIETY NOW. I'M JUST GONNA JUMP RIGHT IN IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN I WAS ON A LOT OF DRUGS AND. IN A PRETTY DECENT STATE OF PSYCHOSIS AND I WAS ARRESTED WITH A CO DEFENDANT FOR CARJACKING AND STRONG ARMED ROBBERY. I WAS INCARCERATED IN A COUNTY JAIL FOR ALMOST SIX FOUR MONTHS AND THEN I TOOK A PLEA BARGAIN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I TOOK A PLEA BARGAIN I PLAYED TO ONE COUNT OF CARJACKING AND WAS SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN STATE PRISON AT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. OF TO DO YOU 85% OF MY TIME I AGREED TO THAT I WAS PLEADING TO A VIOLENT CRIME AND THAT I TOOK A STRIKE ON MY RECORD AS PART OF MY PLEA BARGAIN. I HAD NEVER HAD ANY KIND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I'D NEVER BEEN ARRESTED I'D BEEN PULLED OVER LIKE ONCE OR TWICE THAT I COULD CRAM A WAY OUT OF SPEEDING TICKETS SO I DID THAT A COUPLE TIMES. I HAD A VERY SERIOUS DRUG PROBLEM IF THERE'S A PLACE WHERE I BELIEVE THAT THE SYSTEM FAILED ME. IT'S THAT IT'S IN THAT I. I BELIEVE THAT I NEED A DRUG REHABILITATION MORE THAN I NEEDED TO BE AN EXAMPLE THAT WAS MADE OF SOMEONE IN THE COURT SYSTEM I TAKE COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY CRIME AND FOR WHAT HAPPENED BUT I ALSO BELIEVE AND FOUGHT VERY HARD. TO TRY AND BE SENTENCED UNDER DIFFERENT DRUG COURT GRANT. AND ULTIMATELY. HOW TO LIKE TO. NOT HAVE VERY MUCH CONFIDENCE WHO AT ONE POINT. SAID TO ME YOU WERE ON THE NEWS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A DRUG PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'LL MAKE THEM LOOK BAD. AND. I REMEMBER THAT STICKING OUT AND MY PUBLIC DEFENDERS ADVICE WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT OF DOING A PRISON TERM WAS EITHER TESTIFY AGAINST MY CO DEFENDANT WHO WAS ALSO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD. OR WELL THAT WAS THAT WAS BASICALLY IT TESTIFIED AGAINST MY CO DEFENDANT CLAIM THAT I HAVE BEEN COERCED LIE ESSENTIALLY. LIKE I SAID I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY INCARCERATION BUT I DEFINITELY SAW SOME FLAWS ALONG THE WAY IN THE PROCESS OF BEING INCARCERATED I DID THE MAJORITY OF MY TIME AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN IN CHINO THE LAST NINETY HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS THAT I WAS INCARCERATED I WAS AT A WOMEN'S FIRE CAMP FACILITY. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY I WAS I HAD. I WAS VERY LUCKY IN THE WAY THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO. MY PRISON SENTENCE IN THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT I SAW OTHER WOMEN HAVING I NOTICED A PROFOUND DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY I WAS TREATED BY. PRISON STAFF CORRECTIONS OFFICERS AT CETERA BECAUSE I OFTEN HEARD WHAT'S A NICE WHITE GIRL LIKE YOU DOING HERE WHAT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU SHOULD BE IN PRISON YOU MUST HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED BECAUSE OF A MAN THE BIAS WORKED IN MY FAVOR BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY A VERY STRONG BIAS. I WAS HEAVILY CONNECTED TO THE JEWISH WOMEN'S COMMUNITY IN. AT THE AT THE PRISON IN CHINO THAT WAS VERY FIRST MIGHT CARRY NEWMAN THE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING DEPARTMENT. AND EVERY TIME GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY I TALK ABOUT HOW THAT LADY SAVE MY LIFE BECAUSE SHE DID. SHE HEARD ME SPEAKING AT AN EVENT IN PRISON CAME UP TO ME AFTERWARDS AND TOLD ME THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD. SEND IN AN APPLICATION HERE. IN COMPARISON TO OTHER WOMEN THAT I WAS INCARCERATED WITH. THAT I HAVE SINCE WE'VE ALL GOTTEN OUT AND. NO WE STAY IN CONTACT THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA AT CETERA I HAD. AN INSANELY DIFFERENT REENTRY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OF THE RESOURCES THAT I WAS OFFERED HERE SO I ALMOST FEEL I'M QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT THE STRUGGLES. IN TERMS OF COMING BACK IN BECAUSE I CAME TO A REALLY SAFE PLACE I CARRY IT TALKED ABOUT TO HEAL AND TO FIND MY FOOTING. AND HAVE BEEN PROVIDED OPPORTUNITY AFTER OPPORTUNITY EVERY TIME THAT I'VE ASKED FOR IT IN TERMS OF EDUCATION IN TERMS OF THERAPY I WAS OFFERED FAMILY REUNIFICATION I WAS. I HAVEN'T I HAVE A JOB HERE NOW. THEY KEEP ME AROUND THEY PROMOTED ME A COUPLE TIMES I MEAN I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THAT I WAS MORE THAN MY CRIME MORE THAN A PRISON SENTENCE AND MORE THAN THE VERY WORST MOMENT OF MY LIFE. BUT I'VE SEEN THAT STRUGGLE FOR WOMEN THAT I WAS FRIENDS OR MOTHERS JUST LIKE I AM. THAT WERE DRUG ADDICTS WHO NEEDED SOME HELP NOT TO BE LOCKED UP JUST LIKE I WAS. AND I'VE SEEN THAT STRUGGLE BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. FOR WOMEN THAT ARE IN. YOU KNOW THE STATE FUNDED PROGRAM WHERE PEOPLE ARE. YOU KNOW. NOT PAYING AS CLOSE ATTENTION OR EITHER. IT'S EITHER TOO RESTRICTED OR IT'S NOT RESTRICTED ENOUGH OR EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IT'S NOT REALLY A PROGRAMMER YOU CAN STAY YOU CAN GET A HIGH THERE'S LONG AS YOU DON'T CAUSE A PROBLEM I'VE SEEN A LOT IN TERMS OF. THAT AND I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO NOT HAVE THAT HERE. SO THAT'S. I MEAN MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN. A PRETTY BEAUTIFUL AND IN TERMS OF WHAT I WAS OFFERED. I'M NOW GOING TO SCHOOL TO BE. A DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELOR I PERSONALLY FEEL. ACTUALLY COMMANDED IT TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK I READ THIS TEACHING ONCE AND I TRIED TO ASK GROW BY ABOUT IT AND- YOU DON'T REMEMBER I WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT- I READ THIS TEACHING ONCE WHEN I WAS STUDYING WITH RABBI IN PRISON THAT TALKED ABOUT IF YOU DO WRONG WITH THIS HAND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. RIGHT WITH IT. AND IT'S NOT A MATTER OF LAKE. I WASN'T A NICE PERSON SO I NEED TO BE A NICE ONE BUT I TOOK AWAY FROM THE WORLD IN TERMS OF DRUG ADDICTION AND CRIME. AND. I WANT TO GIVE BACK TO TRY AND COUNTER ACT THAT. KARMIC BALANCE MAKES SENSE. IS THAT TIME. OKAY OF I WAS THERE WILL SINCE KIßM LEAD COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER AT SAINT JOHN'S WELL CHILD AND FAMILY CENTER VERY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE. AND THE- I LOTS OF A TISSUE VÀ I'M ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT GRADUATED HERE IN HANDCUFFS. OF. I FIGURED OUT A LOT HERE I WAS GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOBER HALF OF MY LIFE I'D SPENT SIXTEEN YEARS DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSING AND GETTING INTO ALL KINDS OF STUFF I THINK I'VE BEEN TO JAIL PROBABLY MORE THAN TEN TIMES BUT THE LAST TIME THAT I WENT IT WAS REAL I WAS FACING FINALLY A FIFTY LIVE SENS. FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT FIFTEEN LIFE OFFENSE BUT BECAUSE THIS TIME I WAS ON MY OWN AND I WAS AT MY BOTTOM AGAIN OF THAT I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS DOING AND EVERY TIME I WENT TO COURT. FOR A YEAR I'LL ONLY THREE ARE LOCKED DOWN IN THE BAD GIRLS CLUB IN THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED. AND EVERY TIME I WOULD GO TO COURT. IT WILL GET WORSE LIKE THE CHARGES SEEM TO GET INSANE IT WENT FROM. A SIMPLE FIGHT EVERYONE'S OKAY TO. A SWAT TEAM SURROUNDING THIS PLACE HUGE GUYS AND THEY'RE TAKING ME AWAY AND THEY'RE SAYING OKAY WELL IT WAS AN ATTEMPTED THIS AND THEN IT TURNED INTO AGGRAVATED FIFTEEN TO LIFE A CHARGE THAT. NOBODY MY PUBLIC DEFENDER DID NOT HELP ME FILE ONE MOTION DID NOT KNOW MY NAME AFTER TEN MONTHS OF FIGHTING MY CASE. AND I WOULD COME TO COURT EVERY SIX WEEKS AND I WOULD BE IN FRONT OF A JUDGE FOR FIVE SECONDS THERE'S NO TIME TO REALLY EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON. AND EVERY TIME I WAS LEAVING. I WENT FROM YOU'RE GOING HOME IN A AND B. TO SHOOT BASICALLY ACCEPTED ME BACK SAID. THIS IS GONNA BE SOMETHING SERIOUS KERRY WAS ON THE PHONE EVERY TIME IS GONNA BE SOMETHING SERIOUS AND WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE- YOU'RE READY TO COME BACK AND- I WAS LIKE I AM I'M READY AND BE TO SHE WAS THAT YET. OKAY THAT WILL TAKE YOU BACK. AND THAT DAY. BECAUSE I NEEDED SOME KIND OF REPRESENTATION. I HAD A FRIEND WHO I MET HERE BATES ISSUE BUT AND HE WASN'T A CRIMINAL LAWYER HE WAS AN EMPLOYMENT LAWYER BUT HE WAS LIKE. IF YOU NEED HELP JUST MAKING A DEAL LET ME GO UP THERE WITH YOU AND ALL REPRESENT YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BUT WE WANT YOU HOME. AND HE HE PULLED ME OUT IN THE BACK AND HE WAS LIKE. SIR YOU'RE FIGHTING LIFE. WOODY YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP FOR YOU. AND SO WHEN I HEARD THAT MY FRIEND WAS SO SERIOUS ABOUT THE KIND OF REPRESENTATION THAT IT NEEDED IN THE FACT THAT I COULDN'T AFFORD IT. AS THAT OF MYSELF IN THE COURT ROOM THIS IS MY TIME TO THEM TEN DAYS TO TRIAL THIS IS IT. I STOOD UP AND I FILED THE MARS EMOTION THESE WERE LIKE JAIL HOUSE LAWYERS THAT WERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU LIKE DO THIS DO THAT DON'T DO THIS DO THAT BUT YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT IF YOU SAY THE WRONG THING IN COURT AND MAKE THE JUDGE OF. THAT THAT'S YOUR FUTURE. AND I WAS AFRAID BUT I STOOD UP. AND WITH THE MARS THE MOTION YOU CLEAR OUT THE COURT ROOM AND IT'S YOU THE JUDGE IN YOUR PUBLIC DEFENDER. WHAT IS GOING ON THAT'S WHAT THE JUDGE THAT. THE JUDGE MAKES VERY CLEAR. I AM NOT YOUR FRIEND IN THIS IS NOT COFFEE TIME. AND I'M LIKE OKAY JUST LET ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON I DON'T HAVE ANY DISMISSAL. OF MOTIONS I'M FACING NOW IN A CHARGE THAT DOESN'T EVEN I'M STUDYING THE PENAL CODE BOOKS AND I'M TRYING TO EDUCATE MYSELF THE BEST AS I CAN. BUT THOSE BOOKS ARE SO HARD TO READ. AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS SUBSECTION IS IN THIS KIND OF THING COULD BE OR- OR A DOUBLE CENTER. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR I THINK STRIKE. BUT BEFORE THAT YOU DID NOT GET A TRY FOR. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU GOING TO TRIAL. DOING THAT FAST FORWARD THE JUDGE ENDED UP. SAYING TO COME BACK IN ONE WEEK WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRIAL MY CHARGES WERE NOT THE CHARGES THAT THE DA HAD SAID THAT THEY WERE THAT I WAS NOW FACING AND I WAS SENSE OF FOUR YEARS AT PRISON AND I CAME HOME. WHAT THAT DID WAS INSPIRED ME TO FIGHT AND TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE FIGHT BECAUSE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT CHEST AND NOW THAT'S WHAT I DO I GO AROUND. SOUTH CENTRAL AND COMPTON AND I TRIED EMPOWER PEOPLE AND HELP THEM WITH THEIR FIRST YEAR REENTRY AND I KNOW WITH THAT STRUGGLE IS LIKE AND IF IT CAN HAPPEN TO ME WHO WITH WHITE PRIVILEGE AND GREW UP IN A VERY YOU KNOW PRIVILEGED HOME IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY AND I'M HERE TO MAKE THAT CHANGE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I THINK ALL THESE WOMEN. I'M SO EXCITED TO HAVE THIS KIND OF ATTENTION. HI I'M MY NAME IS NORMA COMPETE ON AND I AM THE WOMEN AND NON BINARY. SERVICES MANAGER AT THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION THAT'S ALL IT'S A LOT. SO AS A- AS A YOUNG PERSON I FOUND MYSELF IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. I IT DIDN'T I DIDN'T GET THERE OVERNIGHT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY IT WAS A PROCESS. I WAS WAY TOO COMFORTABLE WITH HAVING CHAOS IN MY LIFE. BUT IT SPIRALED VERY QUICKLY INTO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. I VAN BECAME PREGNANT WITH MY SON. AND WHEN I BECAME PREGNANT WITH MY SON HE WAS THE LIGHT AT THE END OF A TUNNEL. AND I WAS ABLE TO. SEE CLEARLY BUT I WANTED IN MY LIFE AND IT IT WAS TO BE OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP. SO I DIDN'T HAVE ANY TOOLS I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. SO IN MY YOUNG MESSED UP MINE I MADE A VERY BAD DECISION THE WORST DECISION OF MY LIFE. WHEN I WENT TO SCARE MY SON'S FATHER AND INSTEAD I SHOT HIM. HI. I WAS OFFERED A MANSLAUGHTER DEAL. AND I DID NOT TAKE IT. BECAUSE MY BAIL WAS SO LOW AT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS LIKE AN EPISODE OF LAW AND ORDER AND IT BILL WHY THEY HAD LUNCH IN THE REALIZE I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT. AND THAT I NEEDED TO RAISE MY SON. AND IT WAS ALL GOING TO WORK OUT. I'M I WAS RELEASED ON BAIL. AND I HAD MY SON. AND I WHICH A TRIAL. I'M AND I WAS FOUND GUILTY OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER. OF ONE OF THE. STATEMENTS FROM THE DA THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME IS WHEN HE GAVE THE JURY INSTRUCTION HE SAID DO NOT FIND THIS WOMAN GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER THE LESSER CHARGE OF MANSLAUGHTER IS RESERVED FOR A MAN IN A BAR FIGHT NOT FOR HER. SO I WENT TO PRISON MY SON I WAS REMANDED INTO CUSTODY OF MY SON WAS ABOUT FIVE MONTHS OLD. AND I WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FORTUNATE PEOPLE. I HAD PARENTS WHO TOOK A MAN. AND I WENT TO CHECK CHAU LESS I'M FROM LOS ANGELES SO I WENT AT THAT TIME EVERYONE WENT TO CHOWCHILLA WHICH IS IN FRESNO. AND MY PARENTS MY MOTHER'S AN IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO AND SHE'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. AND SHE SAID I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO VISIT YOU. YOU MIGHT GET A VISIT ONCE A YEAR. SO TO BE SEPARATED FROM THIS FIVE MONTH OLD. TRIAL THEN TO BE TOLD YOU'RE ONLY GUESS HIM ONCE A YEAR WAS. DEVASTATED SO I'D LIKE THE WOMEN THAT SPOKE BEFORE ME I STARTED LISTENING TO EVERYONE AND ACTUALLY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING AND THEY SAID. WHEN YOU GO UP TO THIS ROOM THEY'RE GOING TO ASK YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES BECAUSE YOU ARE. A VIOLENT CRIMINAL. BUT WHAT YOU SHOULD SAY IS THAT YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET TO SEE AYE W. LIKE WHAT IS THAT WOULD THAT MEAN OKAY I'LL DO IT. I'LL DO ANYTHING NOW. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T LISTEN TO YOU GUYS SO I. IN IN THERE THIS WOMAN I DON'T KNOW HER NAME. AND I SAID SHE SAID YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR THIS YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR THAT YOUR POINTS ARE TOO HIGH YOUR VIOLENT YOU NOTHING APPLIES TEAL. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GOT THIS POWER TO SPEAK UP. BUT I SAID. CAN I GO TO SEE I W. PLEASE. I NEED TO RAISE MY SON AND SHE WAS LIKE WHAT DO YOU WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE AND THEY GET REALLY UPSET WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN EVERYBODY THERE SO I THOUGHT I DON'T THINK I'M BETTER THAN ANYBODY. PUT THAT OUT THERE I SUGGEST PLEASE LOOK AT MY CASE FACTORS AND JUST KNOW THAT I WILL I'M NEVER GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND I JUST WANT THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE IN THIS TRIAL LIVE. JUST GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY. US UP I'LL DO EVERYTHING I'M SUPPOSED TO. JUST I JUST NEED THE OPPORTUNITY. AND SHE SLAMMED MY SEE FILE AND SAID WELL I WROTE SOMETHING DOWN SO YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SIX OH TWO WHICH IS AN INTERNAL LIKE APPEAL. AND SO I JUST STAY QUIET. AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNEW I GOT ENDORSED TO SEE I W. WHICH IS THE WOMEN'S PRISON IN CORONA. AND IT WILL LITERALLY SAVED MY LIFE AND MY SON'S LIFE JUST THAT SMALL ACT OF KINDNESS THAT THIS WOMAN DID. SAVE MY LIFE. AND MY SON. SO MY SON. HE SPENT HIS WHOLE CHILDHOOD WITHOUT HIS MOTHER AND WITHOUT HIS FATHER. BUT THIS KID CAME TO THE VISITING ROOM EVERY OTHER WEEK BECAME FRIENDS WITH ALL OF THESE WOMEN THAT SPOILED HIM WAY TOO MUCH. BY THE WAY AND HE REALLY GREW UP IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT HE LEARNED THAT. NOT EVERYBODY WHO'S IN PRISON WHO HAS THIS LABEL IS BAD. BUT THEN NOT EVERYBODY WHO IS A GUARD WITH THIS UNIFORM IS BAD OR GOOD. SO HE LEARNED ALL OF THE STUFF THAT REALLY A CHILD SHOULD LEARN BUT THAT'S WHAT ALL WE HAVE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAD. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE DID. I WAS ABLE TO COME HOME THROUGH THE BOARD OF PRISON TERMS I WAS AT RISK BUT DENIED TWICE I WAS MY- MY A PAROLE WITH REVERSE TWICE I WON IN IN THE LOWER COURT. THEN WHEN I BY THE TIME I CAME HOME MY SON ON HIS WAY TO BOOT CAMP. SO WE MISSED EACH OTHER. I'M AND MY SON WENT TO AFGHANISTAN HE CAME BACK WITH THE PURPLE HEART HE LEFT THE MILITARY AS A SERGEANT HE IS AN AWESOME HUMAN BEING. HE HOWEVER I EVER SAID FOR YEARS AND YEARS WAS I JUST WANTED TO BE A GOOD MAN I JUST NEED THIS KID TO TURN OUT TO BE A GOOD MAN. AND BECAUSE I HAD SO MUCH SUPPORT FROM THE WOMEN ON THE- SIDE. AND FOR MY PARENTS AND. ME BEING ABLE TO GO TO THERAPY WHICH I GOT SORT OF NOT ABOVE BOARD I GOT IT BECAUSE I WORK THERE THIS KID WAS ABLE TO TURN OUT TO BE THIS AMAZING HUMAN BEING AND HE'S IN SCHOOL NOW AND LOL WANTS TO BE AN FBI AGENT. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I DID LIKE A REALLY GOOD JOB. OR LAKE IT THAT IF YOU NEED SOME THERAPY I'M NOT SURE BUT WHATEVER. BUT WE NEED GOOD ONES RIGHT SO. THAT IS. PROBABLY MY TIME BUT THANK YOU. MY NAME IS APRIL GRAYSON I AM EMPLOYED WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FREEDOM CENTER I AM STATEWIDE COORDINATOR OVER THE SYSTEM WARRIORS FREEDOM COALITION. AND MY STORY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY ELSE. SO I'M GONNA ADDRESS ABOUT SYSTEMS FAILING I HAVE TOUCHED EVERY SYSTEM FROM BIRTH. I HAVE BEEN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM I HAVE BEEN ADOPTED I HAVE BEEN IN JUVENILE JUSTICE. I HAVE ONE TIME BEEN SHIPPED FROM EVERY SINGLE. JUVENILE HALL BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PARENT TO COME GET ME AND THEY USE JUNE WHEN I HALL AS A FORM OF PUNISHMENT. AND I WAS A FOSTER CHILD SO. MISSY MY BIRTH MOTHER MY BIRTH MOTHER WAS MURDERED WHEN I WAS THREE HOW WAS ADOPTED AT FIVE INTO A FAMILY THAT WAS PSYCHOTIC SO THAT MOTHER PASSES AWAY ONE ON FOURTEEN MY FATHER PUT ME BACK IN THE SYSTEM AND FIFTEEN AND I AM THAN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD IN THESE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS RUNNING AWAY GONNA JUVENILE HALL BEING ARRESTED FOR BEING BLACK I WAS OUT IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO A MENTAL HOSPITAL AND THEY ARRESTED ME BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I WAS. ALL THE FOURTEEN OF US AND THE OTHER ONES DIDN'T GO BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THEY WANT BLACK SO. AT NINETEEN YEARS OLD SO LET ME BACKTRACK EIGHTEEN I'M IN THE STREETS AYE EMANCIPATE I'M ON MY OWN WITH NO OLD TYPE OF STRUCTURE NO UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO LIVE ON YOUR OWN. AND I STARTED GETTING INVOLVED IN THE STREETS AND I NEED A PAN. AND I START TO BE A PART OF THE SIX WORLD AND- MY ROLE WAS I WAS ABLE TO. HELP HIM PICK UP WOMEN AND THAT'S WHAT I DID AND I WAS EIGHTEEN AND I WAS HELPING HIM PICK UP WOMEN AM AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS WORLD IS THAT IF YOU DON'T PERFORM YOU'RE GETTING BEAT IF YOU DON'T PERFORM YOU'RE GETTING BE AND A MATTER WHAT HAPPENS YOU'RE GETTING BEAT AND YOU NEED TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY TELL YOU TO DO. AND COMING FROM THE BACKGROUND OF LIKE NO PARENTS NO MAMA NO DADDY LIKE THAT WAS MY FORM OF LOVE AND SO THAT'S WHAT I DID I RESPONDED TO THAT. THE TENSION IN THAT THAT ENVIRONMENT. SO IT NINETEEN I GET ARRESTED IN SACRAMENTO AND I WAS NINETEEN I COULD HAVE BEEN A WAS TWENTY SEVEN AND THEY CHARGED ME AS THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME THEY CHARGE ME WITH CAMPING A PANDERING THEY CHARGED ME WITH ALL THE CHARGES THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE CHARGED HIM. HE GOT CHARGED WITH NONE OF MY STUFF THAT I GOT CHARGED WITH AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN IN EVERY SYSTEM A PERSON WHO HAD NEVER EVER HAD A CHANCE WAS THE VICTIM. BUT NOT THE VICTIM THE PERPETRATOR. AND HOW THEY NEVER LOOK AT THIS TO DO WITH THE THREE STRIKER WHO HAD BEEN AND EVERYTHING HE'S ALWAYS BEEN INCARCERATED HOW HE WAS SOMEHOW. NOT A FAULT FOR ANY OF THIS. SO AT THIS TIME THERE REALLY TOUGH ON CRIME THE TEN TWENTY LIFE LIKE I CAN'T JUST CAME OUT AND THERE WAS NO HAD NO ACCESS TO ANYTHING I WAS OFFERED A PLEA BARGAIN I WASN'T UNDER THE ANTI TERRORISM ACT. AND I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO TO TRIAL EITHER GO TO TRIAL TO GET TWENTY TWO YEARS SO I WENT TO TRIAL BY MYSELF PUBLIC DEFENDER WHO DIDN'T GIVE A ALL HE TOLD ME WAS PLEAD GUILTY OR TELL ON THIS DO WELL THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OF THE STREETS IF YOU TELL SOMEBODY YOU'RE GOING BACK TO THE STREET YOU'RE GOING TO DIE SO EITHER WAY WHEN I HAD EITHER. IT WAS TELLING HIM TO GO HOME AND THAT LIVE IN HAVE A- HORRIBLE LIFE OR STAY TRUE TO THE SITUATION AND GO TO PRISON AND HAVE A HORRIBLE LIFE SO I HAD NO OPTIONS AND SO I CHOSE TO. WRITE THE SITUATION. NOW THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT MY OPTION AND I CHOSE FOR MYSELF. I WAS SENTENCED TO TWENTY YEARS EIGHT MONTHS AT NINETEEN YEARS OLD. I WENT TO PRISON. THE DAY BEFORE MY TWENTIETH BIRTHDAY ON A OUR ANIMAL. LOCAL SOME SOCKS AND SOME CHOCOLATES VERY COLD. THIS IS A AND THAT'S WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THAT SITUATION WAS VERY COLD. AND I DID NOT LIVE A MODEL LIFE I DIDN'T DO EVERYTHING THEY TOLD ME TO DO I WAS VERY ANGRY AND I DID EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO DO IT IS BECAUSE YOUR- AND I ENDED UP MAXING OUT AND I DID WILL THEY ENDED UP GIVING ME LIKE TWO YEARS BACK ON SOME TIME AT THE- THE APPELLATE COURT BECAUSE THEY HAD KEPT. THEY HAD RAN ALL MY CHARGES LIKE THERE WAS A POST ABOUT A CONCURRENT BUT THEY RUN OF CONSECUTIVE IN THEIR DOUBLE CHARGING ME AND THEY JUST. THEY CENTERS ME ON TOP WAS SENTENCED ME ON TOP WAS SENTENCED ME. AND SO LOOKING BACK NOW IT PEOPLE LIKE WHEN I CAME HOME TO MY PAROLE OFFICER HE WAS LIKE I HAVE DO THEY GET THREE YEARS FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE. AND HERE I AM THE VICTIM THAT EVEN I WAS THE VICTIM I THOUGHT I WAS A BECAUSE I CAME HOME. BUT HERE I WAS THE VICTIM. DOING TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON FOR. A CRIME THAT A GUY WHO WAS ACTUALLY A PAN. GETS THREE YEARS FOR. SO. I DO MY TIME I COME HOME AFTER A SEVENTEEN YEARS. AND I AM NOW FIGHTING FOR WOMEN I AM NOW AN ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE NEVER HAD AN ADVOCATE. I THINK A FIGHT SO HARD BECAUSE I NEVER KNEW I WAS A VICTIM IN A LOT OF WOMEN DO NOT KNOW THEIR VICTIMS IN EVEN IS THAT A PRISON. ALL THE TREATMENT THAT WE EXPERIENCE A SOUL NORMALIZE THAT YOU THINK IT IS OKAY FOR THE EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE YOU THINK IT'S OKAY BUT ALSO TO CALL YOU A **** YOU THINK IT'S OKAY FOR HIM TO SPEND THE DOORS ON YOU THINK IT'S OKAY FOR SEXUAL ADVANCES THAT ALL THAT IS NORMALIZED IT WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THEY ALL GANG UP ON YOU AND YOUR THEN MAKES IT FEEL HORRIBLE BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF AND SO COMING FROM SYSTEMS WHERE IS NORMALIZED VIEW TO GET TREATED HORRIBLY AS A CHILD INTO ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT'S SUPPOSED TO. TREAT YOU A THIRD TYPE WAY BECAUSE YOU ARE DEEMED THIS HARD CRIMINAL WHEN YOU'RE EVEN OF SITUATION SO WHAT LED UP TO ALL THIS. TO BEING IN THE CUSTODY OF PEOPLE. WHO WERE. NOT NICE. NOT NICE SO TODAY THAT'S WHY FIGHT THE WAY A FIGHT THAT'S WHY GO ON THESE PRISONS THAT'S WHY I DO WHAT I DO THAT'S WHY I WILL NOT BE QUIET THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT I NEED TO STAY NO MATTER WHO IS AGAINST AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DON'T STATE NOBODY WILL AND THE SITUATIONS WILL KEEP.

SOUL I AM THERE WAS ALSO BECAUSE MY FIRST RIDE UP FOR HAVING A SUNBURN IMPRISONED. THAT REALLY DAMAGES STATE PROPERTY. I HAVE I COULDN'T GO TO A GROUP THAT WAS MY FIRST RIDE UP WELL IT JUST SPIRALED I JUST KEPT GETTING RIDE UPS AND I NEVER HAD ANY SELF HELP THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY TYPE OF REHABILITATIVE ANYTHING. OF THAT'S WHAT PRISON WAS LIKE FOR ME AS ALL THE TIME SO RESPECT THAT. AND SO THAT'S MY STORY. BY EITHER ONE OF THE. CAN I TAKE A. HI EVERYONE MY NAME IS MIA NORTH AND WITH ASIAN AMERICANS OF AND JUSTICE ASIAN CAUCUSES HAPPENED CISCO THE WHAT COULD I DO THAT I AM A COMMUNITY ADVOCATE THE WHAT WE HELP REPRESENTS IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE FACING TO DEPORTATION THAT EARLY SITTING IN STATE PRISONS ARE AN ICE DETENTION FACILITIES AND OF COURSE MY LIVE EXPERIENCE AS BEING FOR ME BECAUSE RATE AS SPENT FIFTEEN AND A HALF YEARS. IN CHOWCHILLA. AND I HAVE A LIKE THESE LADIES THEY'VE EXPERIENCED LEGAL SYSTEM THEY FELT THE MANY TIMES FOR MYSELF. HAVING WITH THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IT'S HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE AND- MY BACKGROUND IS LIKE MANY SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES API COMMUNITIES WE'VE COME UP. BACKGROUND OF FAMILIES THAT THAT WAR THAT'S THAT GENOCIDE MY MOM IS THAT YOU KNOW SIDE. SURVIVOR SHE IS ALSO A RAPE SURVIVOR IMAGINE A CHILD COMING TO UNITED STATES WITH A SINGLE MOM AS FAR. AT THE AGE OF FIVE YEARS OLD. TWENTY SIMILAR IN THE COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE VERY. BEEN UNDER RESOURCE AND NOT GIVING ADEQUATE CARE MENTAL HEALTH FOR MY MOM EVEN FOR MY STEP DAD WHO SHE MET HE WAS A SOLDIER DURING THE VIETNAM WAR. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE MOM AND STEP DAD IN THE RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER IT WAS VERY VOLATILE REALLY VIOLENT SO AS A SIX YEAR OLD BEING THE ELDEST OF TWO HALF SIBLINGS. I EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE WITHIN THE HOMES AND AS A SIX YEAR OLD TO GO TO SCHOOL YOU FEEL VERY MUCH ISOLATED BECAUSE YOU THINK IT IS THE ONLY THING HAPPENING TO MY- FAMILY TO MY MOM. AND SHE DID AS YOU KNOW AS SURVIVORS THE SEEK OUT HELP FROM FRIENDS FROM LOVE ONES. FROM CUNY BUT THEY TELL THEM. IN A WHAT DID YOU WRONG GO BACK HAVE CHILDREN TOGETHER WELL MY TO BELIZE XR TWO ACCEPTED AND THAT BECAME NORMAL FOR ME. THAT IF MOM IS OKAY THEN YOU KNOW I'M STUCK ON MY CHILD I HAVE NO VOICE NO WORDS BE THAT GOOD CHILD. AND GO TO SCHOOL. I DID EVERYTHING RIGHTS RIGHT I WAS A GOOD. SISTER TO. MY SIBLINGS. BUT AGAIN I DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS I WAS VERY SHAME OF MY CULTURE. OF IDENTIFYING COLLECTED WHO WHAT IS IT WHO IS LEAH HOW CAN SHE RELATE TO. PEOPLE IN SCHOOL THAT HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIFE THAT SHE WAS GOING OUT TO RIGHT COMING FROM A P. I AM. REFUGEES BACKGROUND AND BY THE TIME. I WAS SEVENTEEN I DID WAS NOT VERY SIMPLY. SHIPS TO ME WHAT WAS A MODEL FAMILY WAS SOMETHING WATCHING FROM LIKE FULL HOUSE RIGHT THAT WAS LIKE A FAMILY I WANTED THAT I COULD HAVE. AND I END UP. UNFORTUNATELY HAD NO SALT SOLIDIFY RELATIONSHIPS AND IT MEETING MY CO DEFENDANT MIGHT BE IS A WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN. AND SHORTLY WEEKS AFTER BEFORE AFTER I TURN EIGHTEEN HE BECAME IN A JEALOUS RAGE WHEN I FIND INTEREST IN SOMEONE ELSE. AFTER HE HAD BEEN RAPED ME HE FORCED ME TO CONFRONT MY VICTIM THEREFORE I WAS NOT THE MAIN PERPETRATOR HOWEVER WHEN I WAS ARRESTED I WAS. PRESSING LAW ENFORCEMENT TRUST IN THE POLICE THE END UP CHARGING ME WITH FIRST DEGREE PREMEDITATION MURDER LINE WEIGHT I WAS SENTENCED AT TWENTY YEARS OLD TO TWENTY YEARS TO LIFE WITHOUT POLICY PEARL. GOING TO PRESENT IT TOOK ME ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN YEARS TO SAY THAT I DID NOT WANT MY VICTIMS DIE I DID NOT WANT HIM TO DIE I WAS PROTECTING MYSELF OUT OF FEAR FULL WHAT WHAT I FELT THAT HE WAS OMITTED THAT HE WAS NOT GOING. TO YOU KNOW THAT NO ONE WAS GOING TO BELIEVE ME AND WHEN I DEBTS TELL MY STORY THAT HAPPENED A TURNOUT BACKFIRED ON ME WHAT AND UP IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. VIRTUALLY I WAS ABLE TO GET MY CONVICTION MY A LOT VACATED HAD A SECOND WE TRIAL BUT I WAS SENTENCED TO FIFTEEN YEARS TO LIFE. BY AND I DID WANT TO BOARD OF I'M THRILLED GOVERNOR POLICE I WENT TO BOARD HEARINGS THE FIRST BILL WAS THE NOT BECAUSE THE COMMISSION THAT DID NOT FELT THAT I WAS A BATTERED WOMAN THAT I BLAME MY ABUSE ON I'M NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. WHICH. IS NOT LONG ENOUGH WEARING MY APPEAL. HOWEVER. ONE IS A LIKE MAJORITY OF THOSE THE END UP IN PRISON SORT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND PLACING THEM IN PRISON AND CAUSE MORE TRAUMA TO THEM. ONTO THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE AGAIN LIKE MY FAMILY MACINNES DOING TIME WITH ME. AND WHAT REALLY I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I HAD FACE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES I THOUGHT AS A PERMANENT RESIDENT THAT I WOULD OFFER PROTECTION IT WAS UNTIL THREE YEARS FOR MY POOR. PAROLE BOARD HEARING. AND THEN WHEN I WAS PICKED UP BY. AYE AYE. FIVE DETENTION FOR SIX MONTHS THE ONLY REASON WHY I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE- THE- THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE BELIEVE THAT AS A SURVIVOR THAT THE CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT PROTECT ME FROM THE DEATH THREATS. OF MY ABUSER AND- AND HIS FAMILY. BUT TO SAY I THINK REFORMS HAVE TO BE DONE NOT IN THE CRIMINAL. NOT IMMIGRATION REFORM AND ALSO WITHIN THE STATE REFORM AS WELL TORRANCE FROM JUST BEFORE. BECAUSE THESE TWO THERE ARE VERY INTERSECTED. IF WE WANT TO HAVE A QUICK IT EQUALITY EQUITY FOR ALL. DO NOT. DO NOT ALL. ALSO INCLUDE IMMIGRANTS AS WELL BECAUSE- IMMIGRANTS HAVE SERVE TIME THE SERVER TIME WHY SHOULD THEY- BE CONTINUE CRIMINALIZE FURTHER RIGHT. THERE ARE OF LOSS OF LOS FANS TO VERIFICATION SYSTEM OF AUSTRIA MEMBERS. THIS IS THE ONLY HOME THAT WE'VE NOTICES PRO CHILDREN. AND WHEN THEY WENT TO THIS IS THAT THEY WERE NOT TOLD THAT. THEY WERE THEY WERE GOING TO FACE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES. RIGHT AND I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE OF BEING ABLE TO SAY WHETHER THE ALONG. WITH WHERE THEY SHOULD LIVE. AND I THINK AS LIVING FOR THAT IF CALIFORNIA IS A LEADING STATE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND- AND- LEAVING A SECOND CHANCES THAT DO NOT. DISCLOSE IMMIGRANTS LIKE MYSELF AND OTHERS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'M STILL CITY LEVEL I CAN BE PICKED UP ANYTIME AND- THE DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS CAN START. THOUGH WE APPLIED THE GOVERNOR FOR IT'S PUTTING AB THIRTY TWO TWO AND PRIVATE THE TO AND THE PRESS THE STUMP BUT YET. CALIFORNIA SEES OUR NEED TO STOP COLLABORATING WITH ICE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TO NOT HAND OVER THOSE HAVE SERVED TIME OVER TO I. TO SAY WHAT WE TOWARDS CAN WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR IMMIGRANTS THAT WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SIX SIXTEEN YEARS I SPENT PRISON. AND THEN IT'S A POP PROCEEDED TO POINT ME TO A COUNTRY THAT HAD NO TIES TO. I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE CONVERSATION IS TO START WITH THE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS WELL THE COMMODE JUST BEFORE. THANK YOU. ALSO WAS ARE ALSO ON THAT BECAUSE I GOT SO EXCITED. SO PROPOSAL CONVICTION RELIEF FOR SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF THE ALTERNATIVE IS PARDONS. PARTICIPLES WILL OPEN IMMIGRATION PERSONS. FILE AND THE GOVERNOR'S PARTY WILL STOP MY DEPORTATION AND GIVE ME A RIDE TO GET MY GREEN CARD BACK OVER TOWARDS YOU YOU KNOW SAYS A SHIP SO I CAN YOU KNOW NOT HAVE TO APPLY FOR A WORK PERMIT AND NOT FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY NOT BE ABLE TO COME BACK. THOSE ARE TURNED IS ALSO WE ENCOURAGE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND DA'S TO WORK WITH TO GET TO VACATE THEIR SENSES TO BE NOT THE PORTABLE THAT THOSE ARE POLLS ALTERNATIVES FOR THOSE THAT ARE FACING THE PARTITION LIKE MYSELF. THANK. HI MY NAME. AND IS THE BUTTON OKAY. MY NAME IS INGRID ARCHIE AND I WORK AT IN THE WAY OF LIFE REENTRY PROJECT I AM FORMALLY INCARCERATED I GREW UP IN SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES MY MOTHER WAS A DRUG ADDICT MY DAD WAS A DRUG DEALER MY HOME WAS VERY VIOLENT. MOST OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS WERE INVOLVED IN GANGS ON MY MOM AND MY DAD'S SIDE SELL EVERYBODY IN MY FAMILY WAS HUSTLERS AFFAIRS ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM AT THE AGE OF SEVEN I WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM MY MOM FOR CHILD ABUSE AND MY DAD WAS NOT ABLE TO TAKE CUSTODY OF ME BECAUSE HE HAD A MARIJUANA CONVICTION ALTHOUGH MARIJUANA IS NOW LEGAL RIGHT. SELL ON. I WAS ADOPTED AT THE AGE OF EIGHT. ON I SPENT ABOUT TEN YEARS AWAY FROM MY MOTHER AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE AT FOURTEEN SHE CAME BACK INTO MY LIFE I BECAME VERY ANGRY WITH HER BECAUSE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WAS GONE ON FOR SO LONG IT WAS BECAUSE OF HER DRUG ADDICTION AND A LOT OF SHAME AND GUILT BECAUSE SHE HAD ALLOWED ME TO GO TO THE SYSTEM AND BECOME ADOPTED OUT. I ENTERED INTO THE JUVENILE SYSTEM AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN. AND I WAS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT AND BATTERY IS TOM PETTY DEATH ON BECAUSE OF LAKE CALLED ME THE A WORD AND WE JUMPED HIM. AND I WAS THEY WANTED TO SEND ME TO WHY A FOR MY FIRST TIME INSTEAD OF TO SEE WHY I WAS SO ANGRY THEY WANTED TO SEND YOU TO A YOUTH PRESENT. FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO I ALSO RAN AWAY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AND SO I ENTER BACK INTO THE DCFS SYSTEM AFTER BEING ADOPTED. AND I ENDED UP WITH IN A PLACEMENT WITH A LADY WHO WAS FRIENDS WITH THE JUDGE DOOR AND AT THE TIME WHO IS THE JUDGE IN INGLEWOOD AND HE DIDN'T SEND ME TO PRISON HE GAVE ME A BREAK. FORTUNATELY. I SAW CYCLE IN AND OUT OF THE JUVENILE HALL FOR I THINK UNTIL I WAS EIGHTEEN ON AT THAT POINT I STARTED SELLING DRUGS AND I WENT TO THE COUNTY FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THERE ARE PRETTY MUCH WAS IN THE STREET SELLING DRUGS ANALYST. I WAS A PART OF THE GAY CULTURE. I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE LIKE A WHOLE LOT OF A WHOLE LOT OF ROLE MODELS YOU KNOW TO SAY YOU KNOW DON'T GO THAT ROUTE TAKE THIS ROUTE IT WAS MORE OR LESS THEY WANTED TO YOU KNOW I HAD I HAD A SKILL SET YOU KNOW I DIDN'T I WASN'T IN THE STREETS AND I DIDN'T WANNA CONFORM TO LIKE CELL IN MY BODY OUR TO HUSTLE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SAW IN CELL I TRACKED THE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE BECAUSE I HAD THAT SKILL OF HUSTLING. ON AND THEN THAT JUST KINDA GRUEL AND TO ME COMMITTEE MORE MORE CRIMES. I ENTERED INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM. AT THE AGE OF TWENTY I THINK TO. MY CHARGE WAS A GAME I HAD A GAME CHARGE A GUN CHARGE IN A POUND OF MARIJUANA. NONE OF IT WAS MINE BUT I TAKE THE CASE BECAUSE- I WAS RAISED TO. BASICALLY IF YOU'RE COLLISON ASK YOURS AND YOU RIDE IT OUT. CELL I THAT WAS MY FIRST PRISON SENTENCE. AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIX I BELIEVE I CAME HOME I FIRST MET SUSAN BARTON. OUT WITH TO HER HOME SHE YOU KNOW KIND OF OPENED HER ARMS TO ME. I HAD A FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD AT THAT TIME. AND I WENT THROUGH YOU KNOW I WENT TO OUR HOUSE I GOT AN APARTMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE I WAS LAID OFF FROM FOR RISING BECAUSE I HAD A CONVICTION ON MY RECORD FOR SELLING DRUGS. AFTER I HAD WORKED THERE FOR SIX YEARS. AT THAT POINT I STARTED COMMITTING CRIMES AGAIN BECAUSE I NEEDED TO SURVIVE. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I'D KATA I WAS IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP I FLEE FROM THE ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND I CAUGHT A CHARGE FOR CHILD ENDANGERMENT I LEFT MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER IN THE CAR ON I TOOK MY LITTLE CHILD WHICH WAS TO LET THE TIME INTO THE STORE TO BUY PAMPERS I WAS OVERWHELMED I WAS GOING TO POST PARTUM DEPRESSION WHICH I HAVE WASTE OVER AND OVER TO THE SHELTER THAT I WAS AND I WAS FLEEING FROM MY ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT I NEEDED HELP. ON THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED TO FIGURE IT OUT SO THAT DAY I WENT TO JAIL THEY TOOK MY KIDS WE ALL WENT TO JAIL THE CAR WENT TO JAIL MY KIDS WENT TO JAIL AND I WENT TO JAIL. THE NET I THINK PROP FORTY SEVEN HAD CAME AROUND. AND IT WAS JUST SO HAPPENED I WAS ALREADY ON PROBATION FOR A AT THAT CHARGE. AND THEY READ THE THEY RAN THE ON. THEY RAN THE CHILD ENDANGERMENT CHARGES THAT THAT CHARGE TOGETHER BUT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SAID THAT I DESERVE TO GO TO PRISON CELL THEY ENDED UP SENDING ME TO PRESENT THE DAY BEFORE PROP FORTY SEVEN PASSED. SELL OUT WAS I WENT TO PRISON I ADVOCATED MYSELF FROM MYSELF EIGHT MONTHS LATER AND I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT ON PROP FORTY SEVEN. IN THE WAY. ON I CAME BACK TO A NEW WAY OF LIFE ON MY DAUGHTER WAS HAVE BEEN MOLESTED WHILE I WAS IN PRISON BY THE PEOPLE WHO I PLACED HER WITH. AND THAT'S WHEN I MET CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE ALL AT THE SAME TIME. I TELL MY STORY A LOT ON HOW I CAME HOME ON HOW I WAS ABLE YOU KNOW TO JUST KEEP A LEVEL HEAD. EVERY NIGHT BACK WITH MY KIDS CELL WHILE I WAS DOING GOOD WORK I WAS FIGHTING FOR MY KIDS. AND FIGHTING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WELL BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER HAD BEEN MOLESTED. AND I HAD TO FIGURE OUT IF I WAS GOING TO KILL HIM OR IF I WAS GOING TO ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO YOU KNOW. DO WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO AND SO I CHOSE THE LATTER BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER NEEDED ME MORE THAN THE PRISON SYSTEM DATE. EIGHT MONTHS LATER I WAS REUNITED BACK WITH ALL OF MY CHILDREN. I BECAME EMPLOYED AT IN THE WAY OF LIFE AS THE PROP FORTY SEVEN SPECIALIST. FROM THEN I BECAME A CIVIC ENGAGEMENT COORDINATOR WHERE I STARTED TO GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND TRAIN PEOPLE ABOUT DIFFERENT MEASURES THAT WILL PASS. THAT WOULD BE ON THE BALLOT. FROM THEN WOMEN ORGANIZING FOR JUSTICE NEEDED LEAF FACILITATOR WHICH IS TO TRY AND WOMEN ON THE DCFS SYSTEM. SO A LOT OF TIMES WE GO THROUGH THINGS IN OUR LIFE AND WE WONDER YOU KNOW WHY. MY KIDS WERE TAKEN AND I WENT TO HELL BECAUSE GOT WANTED ME TO FACILITATE A GROUP OF WOMEN. WHO WILL BECOME LEADERS WHO WOULD FIGHT AGAINST. THE CFS AT THIS TIME. ALSO I SIT ON THE- SECOND CHANCE COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND IF YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT TIME DONE. WE BARF TIME DONE AND WE JUST PASSED A LOTS IT EXPLAINS A MILLION CONVICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY WE'VE BROUGHT IN THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT I'M OVER THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT APARTMENT SO NOW I HIRE PEOPLE TO GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND I GO TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO ALSO TRAIN OTHER PEOPLE I BECAME THE FIRST PERSON IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MY MARIJUANA CONVICTION CHANGE UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR TO A MISDEMEANOR AND NOW ADVOCATE NOT FOR THE USE OF IT BUT THE CRIMINALIZATION PART AND THE FACT THAT IF PEOPLE SEE MY FACE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IT WORKS AND THEY COULD BE ABLE TO GET THEIR RECORDS CHANGE. I'M HERE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I MORE THAN QUALIFY FOR THE SPACE. ON. AND I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE AND I'M GOING TO BE INTENTIONAL IS NOT ENOUGH BLACK WOMEN. THAT THEY SEE THAT ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE SPACES AND I FEEL LIKE BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH SO MUCH THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO STAND AS THE GAP IN BETWEEN SO THAT WHEN WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THEY COULD GET A CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN THEY LAND IN THOSE BATES. AND A FEELING HOPELESS IN A FILM LIKE THEY CAN'T. ON THEY CAN'T GET UP OR THEY FEEL LIKE THEY NOT GONNA GET THEY KEY IS BACK I FEEL LIKE THEY NOT DON'T GET THAT DREAM JOB I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DREAM AGAIN BUT THEY SEE THAT I WENT THROUGH ALL THAT. AND I STAND HERE NOW CELLS THEY COULD YOU KNOW HAVE THAT HOPE THAT THEY NEED. TO MOVE FORWARD. WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU. FOR YOUR STORIES AND YOUR RESILIENCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ALL OF YOUR TESTIMONIALS REALLY ARE ABOUT WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MORE MINUTES FOR THIS PANEL AND BECAUSE IT IS A HEARING WE HAVE A PARTICULAR FORMAT BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO INVITE. THOSE OF YOU ON THE DÍAS WITH ME TO CROSS EXCHANGE SO IF THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT YOU WANTED TO ASK ONE OF YOUR FELLOW FEMALE WARRIORS. OR GENDER NON CONFORMING WARRIORS. OR IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT STRUCK YOU THAT SOMEONE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE IN EXCHANGE ON THE DÍAS FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES BECAUSE ALL OF THE STORIES ARE DIFFERENT THE WOMEN ARE VERY DIFFERENT WE WERE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD A RAINBOW OF EXPERIENCES SO THAT FOLKS CAN GET A SENSE OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TREATMENT SO I WANT TO STEP BACK AND LET YOU ALL CONVERSE FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES IF THAT'S OKAY. I'M A. YEAH ONCE AS MAYBE CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH MANY APRIL BECAUSE LIKE I KNOW FOR MYSELF APRIL LIKE I BELIEVE THAT I'LL BE BACK IN PRISON RIGHT NOW IF I WASN'T WORKING LIKE FOR THE CENTER LIKE THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE MY COMMUNITY THAT KEEPS ME GROUNDED AND IT'S LIKE SKIN TAKES OUR COMMUNITY TO HEAL OUR COMMUNITY BUT LIKE I DON'T GET TO SEE YOU AS MUCH BUT LIKE DO YOU FEEL THE SAME LIKE I LOVE YOU BUT I GUESS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT SO I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU BECAUSE I SEE THE CHANGES. WITH YOU BEING AT THE CENTER WITH OUR. FOLKS AND I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU. IF YOU FEEL THE SAME. SO I WAS GOING TO CLARIFY. I LOVE YOU I LOVE. AND SO WHAT I'M WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY IS THAT THE CENTERS WITH KEPT YOU FREE YEAH. AND YOU'RE WONDERING IF I FEEL THE SAME I USE THE ONE I'M CLOSEST IS ON DISPLAY LIVE AS OVER I APPRECIATE YOU FOR TAKING A STEP TO KICK THIS OFF. I THINK WAS KEEPING ME FREE IS SO BEFORE I GOT TO THE CENTER I DO HUMAN TRAFFICKING WORK ALSO. AND SO MY PAROLE A TO SO LET ME SAY THIS. I WASN'T. COMMUNITY WORK I MET LIKE BESIDE LIKE THE CENTER BUT AND COMMUNITY YOU KNOW SO. WELL I THINK THAT. WALKING INTO A PLACE THAT UNDERSTANDS LIKE COMING INTO THE HUMAN TRAFFIC ORGANIZATION IN THEM SEEING THE VICTIM THAT NOBODY HAD EVER SAW. AND THEN ALLOWING ME TO IDENTIFY WITH THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A VICTIM THERE THAT THE SYSTEM HAD DONE ME SO WRONG. AND EMPOWERING ME TO. STAND IN THAT POWER IN THAT TRUTH I THINK THAT. WOULD HELP ME STAY FREE IF SOMEBODY FINE SAND. BY THE SECOND. YEAH THEY **** YOU OVER. AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT IT IS BRUTALLY HONEST LIKE I HAVE NEVER HAD A FAIR CHANCE EVER. AND SO COMING AROUND PEOPLE WHO. IDENTIFY WITH ALL PARTS OF YOU NOT JUST THE PART THAT THEY WANT TO SEE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT HELPS ME STAY FREE AND THEN KNOWING THAT THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE. DOWN LEXULOUS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LIVE THE MODEL LIFE SO FOR THEM TO SEE US OUT HERE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FIGHTING IN WHO WERE IN THE RIGHTS AND WHO WERE DOING ALL THE THINGS I THINK ESTÁ. I JUST. THAT WAS ME BUT NOW. WHEN I SAY IT IS FOR THEM TO SEE THE PEOPLE WHO THEY THOUGHT COULD MAKE IT MAKE IT. IT MAKES ME. MAKE SURE THAT I STAND IN ALL OF THIS TRUTH BECAUSE I WANT THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN COME HOME. WE DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN BE RIGHT OF FREE. TO BECOME WRITER FREE SO THEY CAN COME HERE OUT HERE WITH US INTO WHAT WE DO. I THINK THAT'S WHAT. KEEPS ME. SO GROUNDED IS THE PEOPLE THAT WE LEFT. YES I FEEL. I THINK SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT WAS SAID THAT. KIND OF ENCAPSULATED EVERYTHING WE WERE ALL KIND OF TRYING TO SAY SOMEONE DOWN THERE I'M SORRY I DON'T REMEMBER WHO MENTIONED GETTING A WRITE UP FOR HAVING A SUNBURN BECAUSE IT WAS YEAH BECAUSE IT WAS DESTRUCTION OF STATE PROPERTY. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SOMEHOW HIGHLIGHTING EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT. YOU CAN BE AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILIES AND YOUR LOVED ONES AND YOUR CHILDREN FOR POTENTIALLY A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE YOU GOT A SUNBURN BECAUSE YOU'RE STATE PROPERTY AND YOU'RE NOT MORE THAN THAT AND I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM FAILS PEOPLE IS THAT YOU GET PUT INTO A SYSTEM THAT DOES EVERY SINGLE THING IT CAN TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU DON'T. HAVE A RIGHT TO CONNECT TO YOUR OWN HUMANITY. ANY TYPE OF REHABILITATIVE WORK THERAPY GROUP PROCESSING ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE BROUGHT IN BY PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME NOT BY THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM ITSELF. IF YOU'RE NOT IN AN AREA IN A PRISON THAT'S EASILY ACCESSIBLE IF YOU'RE NOT IN A PRISON THAT HAS. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS CONNECTED TO IT YOU'RE TOTALLY SCREWED AND YOUR STATE PROPERTY. AND YOU'RE IN TROUBLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE SUNSCREEN. AND I THINK THAT A DISSERVICE IT'S DONE IS WOMEN PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY A WOMEN'S ISSUE COME BACK INTO THE WORLD HAVING SPENT WHATEVER AMOUNT OF TIME THEY HAD. EITHER DOING EVERY SINGLE THING THEY CAN TO HANG ON TO THEIR SANITY MISERABLE FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR TIME BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO BUY INTO THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE. NO HUMANITY OR COMING OUT BEING TRAINED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE STATE PROPERTY. AND. THAT IN CAPS LEADS IT FOR ME THAT'S WHERE THE SYSTEM IS FAILING PEOPLE. I'M SOMEONE WHO MADE A TERRIBLE DECISION I AM NOT THE PROPERTY OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT DOESN'T REMEMBER MY NAME MAKES MONEY OFF OF ME BEING INCARCERATED. GETS MAD AT ME FOR GETTING A SUNBURN. SO THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO WHY DON'T WE GIVE A COLLECTIVE ROUND OF APPLAUSE THANK YOU JUST A NOTE THAT WAS NOT FOR ME THAT WAS FOR ALL OF YOU. SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO TRANSITION INTO OUR SECOND PANEL AND WHILE WE MAKE THE TRANSITION I JUST WANT TO RECAP SOME OF THE THINGS THAT. I TOOK NOTES SñNG. THAT ARE. WARRIORS SISTERS SAID THAT 95% OF THOSE WOMEN INCARCERATED OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS THAT ARE FURTHER TRAUMATIZED IN PRESENT. THAT WE THINK THIS TREATMENT IS NORMALIZED. THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE BETTER THAN US. THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TOOLS. ONE OF OUR WOMEN SAID I NEVER HAD A CHANCE. AND ULTIMATELY I THINK ONE OF. A FINAL COMMENT IS WE WANT YOU HOME WOMEN WE WANT YOU HOME. SO WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO TRANSITION INTO OUR SECOND PANEL. AND THIS PANEL IS COMPRISED OF PROFESSIONALS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF FOLKS WE HAVE PROSECUTORS WE HAVE FOLKS THAT WORK IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. AND SO I TO I'M GONNA LET. YOU ALL GETS IT WOULD WITH EVERYONE'S HERE'S WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT AM I WILL ALSO ASK YOU ALL SOME QUESTIONS TO T. YOU UP AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO. RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASK YOU CAN CERTAINLY FEEL FREE TO GO WITH YOUR OWN FLOW WITH WHAT YOU DECIDED THAT YOU WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT. AND YOU SHOULD ALSO FEEL FREE TO RESPOND TO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE FIRST PANEL BECAUSE THIS IS IT IS A CONVERSATION IT IS ABOUT COALITION BUILDING BUT ULTIMATELY IS THAT ABOUT. IT IS ABOUT GAINING THE DATA THAT WE NEED TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IS LEGISLATORS TO FIX THE SYSTEM AND I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE. AS HARD AS THIS MAY BE TO HEAR I BELIEVE THAT THE SYSTEM. IS WORKING JUST FINE IT'S WORKING AS IT WAS INTENDED TO DO. WHICH IS TO INCARCERATE OVER PUNISH OVER PENALIZE AND KILL PEOPLE IN AND A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY IN A IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT THE D. HUMINT HUMANIZATION. AND SO IT'S DOING WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT WE HAVE TO DISMANTLE THAT. SO QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER. I'M IN WHAT WAYS DO YOU FEEL THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE REFORMED PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO SENTENCING. WHAT BARRIERS ARE OBSTACLES HAVE YOU ALL FACED TRYING TO IMPLEMENT ANY REFORMS. WAS THERE A TURNING POINT IN YOUR CAREER WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT YOUR PROFESSIONAL SKILLS COULD BE USED AS A TOOL TO IMPLEMENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. DO YOU HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS OR LOVED ONES WHO ALSO BEEN TOUCHED BY THE PENAL SYSTEM. AND I'M DO YOU VIEW THE PRACTICE OF LAW THROUGH A SOCIAL REFORM LANDS OR WHAT LANDS DO YOU. VIEW THE PRACTICE OF LAW SO ONCE AGAIN FEEL FREE TO ENGAGE IN ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS OR TO NOTS BUT SOMETIMES WE LIKE CHECKERS AND SO I WILL ONCE AGAIN START FROM MY LEFT AND MOVED TO MY RIGHT. AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO INTRODUCE AYE YOU WILL PRODUCE YOURSELF TO THE AUDIENCE BECAUSE ALL OF THIS IS BEING RECORDED AND LIVE STREAMED ACTUALLY I'M AND WE ALSO HAVE A TWITTER FEED GOING. HI MY NAME IS KEVIN HASSETT I AM A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY I WORK IN LA COUNTY. I'VE BEEN A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING COURT DOWNTOWN FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. BUT BY NUMBERS WISE I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING ON BECAUSE I DID IN COMPTON BEFORE I CAME DOWNTOWN FOR MORE THAN HALF MY CAREER. SO I AM SOMEONE WHO COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS THAT A CASE IS NOT ABOUT THE PAPER OR THE THINGS WRITTEN ON IT IT'S ABOUT THE PERSON. BECAUSE I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING WOMEN AND MEN WHO HAVE CHOSEN THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEY TO COME TO THE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING COURT'S DOWNTOWN. SO I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHAT MY OFFICE IS DONE TO TRY TO STEERED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH FELONIES. TO THE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING COURT'S JACKIE LACEY HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING COURTS AND THE TREATMENT COURTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SHE WAS A PART OF THE COMMITTEE THAT STARTED OF THE WOMEN'S REENTRY COURT AND ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER WHO WAS PART OF THAT COMMITTEE IS HERE TODAY. IN SUPPORT OF US AND THAT IS A PROGRAM FOR FEMALE DEFENDANTS SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT I AM INVOLVED IN IF I COULD GIVE YOU A BRIEF SUMMARY SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'VE ALREADY. AND MAYBE USE THAT AS A STEPPING STONE TO GET SOME DIALOGUE GULPING IN MAYBE. TWEET AND I THINK. THE MAIN TWO THINGS OUT OF THE WAY IS THE MAIN TWO BARRIERS ARE MONEY. AND TREATMENT AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE OF BOTH. SO WITH THAT SAID. ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING COURTS ARE DESIGNED FOR FELONIES LIKE I INDICATE ITSELF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AT A DOWNTOWN A WE HAVE A CITY ATTORNEY SO I DON'T HAVE THE MISDEMEANORS BUT I DO HAVE THE FELONIES SO USUALLY INDIVIDUALS ARE CHARGED WITH. A VERY SERIOUS CRIMES ARE CHEAP THEY'RE FACING PRISON TIME THEY'RE FACING JAIL TIME. SO I AM INVOLVED IN SIX ALTERNATES SENSING COURTS ONE OF THEM'S CALLED THE SENTENCE DEFENDER DRUG COURT IT'S THE MOST SERIOUS PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IT'S DESIGNED FOR DRUG ADDICTS AND IT DOES INVOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL STARTING THEIR TREATMENT IN JAIL. IT'S IN THE TREATMENT POD AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REALLY FOCUSES THE INDIVIDUAL ON TREATMENT. AND THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE FACING PRESENT OUR STATE OR JAIL TIME ANYWAY. AFTER THAT THE RELEASED INTO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND THEN THEY GO TO OUTPATIENT AND THEN THEY GO TO AFTER CARE. THEY ARE PLACED ON FIVE YEARS OF PROBATION. AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR PROBATIONARY TERM ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH IF THEY'VE DONE WELL. THEY LIED TO THE COURT AND THE COURT TYPICALLY GRANTS AND EXPAND BENT AND THIS IS A DISMISSAL OR THEY'RE ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW THEIR PLEA. UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION TWELVE OF THREE POINT FOUR AND IF THE CHARGES WHAT WE CALL THE WALL THERE WHICH MEANS IT'S BETWEEN A FELONY AND MISDEMEANOR THE JUDGE WILL REDUCE AT SEVENTEEN BE. BUT THESE ARE ALL POST CONVICTION SENTENCING. SO THE NEXT PROGRAM THAT WE RENDON MY COURT ROOM IS ALSO THE CO OCCURRING DISORDERS COURT IT IS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL AND ALSO HAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM. AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T START OFF THEIR TREATMENT IN JAIL MAY START OFF THEIR TREATMENT IN ACTON ANTELOPE VALLEY REHABILITATION CENTER FOR THREE MONTHS A LOT OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE DON'T ARE HOMELESS. SO IT TAKES THEM OUT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT PUTS THEM AWAY AND THEY CAN WALK AWAY IT IS NOT A LOCKDOWN FACILITY BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO WALK AWAY SO THEY MOST OF THEM ARE MOTIVATED TO STAY THERE. THEY COME BACK DOWNTOWN AND GO TO OUTPATIENT AND SOBER LIVING. THE SAME THING THEY COMPLETE THE PROGRAM AFTER ONE YEAR APPROXIMATELY THEY ARE POST CONVICTION POST SENTENCING THEY GET THEIR CHARGE REDUCED AND THEIR CASE DISMISSED. BY THE NEXT ONE THAT WE DO IS WHEN IT WAS RE ENTRY COURT MEN'S REENTRY COURT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER TWO QUARTS IT WAS DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH WOMEN'S ISSUES. SO APT THAT FACILITY IT'S PROTOTYPES IT'S IN POMONA THEY HAVE MORE THAN JUST DRUG COUNSELORS WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. THEY HAVE THERAPISTS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THEY HAVE THEY ALLOW CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF ELEVEN THROUGH WOMEN CAN BRING THEIR OWN CHILDREN THEY DO TREATMENT WITH THEIR CHILD AND- THEY TREAT THEIR CHILDREN ALONG WITH THE MOTHERS. THEY HAVE A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO CAN COME IN AND DISTRIBUTE OCCASION. THEY DEAL WITH TRAUMA THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED FOR WAS TO ASSIST WOMEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM TRAUMA WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHO ARE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT PROGRAM IS ALL ENCOMPASSING THEY ALSO ALLOW WOMEN WHO HAVE MEDICAL PROBLEMS TO GO TO THAT TREATMENT PROGRAM. SO THE GREATEST PART ABOUT THAT PROGRAM WAS IT INITIALLY WHEN IT WAS STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE PROGRAM WAS APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PEOPLE AND IT WAS DESIGNED AS A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS FUNDED BY A GRANT. NGUYEN DRUG MEDI CAL CAME INTO PLAY WITH NOW BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND THAT PROGRAM AND WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY WOMEN IN THAT PROGRAM NOW. SO IT STARTED OFF AT FIFTY AND WERE A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER. AND I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN THE PROBLEMS ARE THE NUMBERS AND THE MONEY IS AN ISSUE SO I'M ONE INDIVIDUAL I'M THE DA AND THE COURT I GO TO COURT FIVE DAYS A WEEK. THERE'S ONE OF ME AND THERE'S ABOUT FIVE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS THAT I WORK WITH. AND SO I THINK ONE ISSUE WOULD BE A NUMBERS GAME IF YOU WANT TO UP THE NUMBERS INDIVIDUALS COMING. YOU WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE THE COURTS ASSIGNED OR THERE'D HAVE TO BE PERHAPS A CHANGE IN CULTURE. YOU KNOW OF I WAS VIEWED AS AT IT'S VIEWED AS A NON TRIAL ASSIGNMENT AND MISS LACEY WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ME AND I WAS PROMOTED IN MY ASSIGNMENT. BUT A LOT OF THE DA'S DON'T VIEW THIS IS A VERY. GOOD ASSIGNMENT AND SO THE CULTURE HAS TO CHANGE I THINK THE CULTURE IS CHANGING NOW THROUGH THESE. THINGS AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW IMPORTANT THESE ARE BUT I WAS KINDA LOOKED DOWN ON IN THE DA'S OFFICE SO. I'VE HELD MY HEAD UP HIGH AND I KNOW THE GOOD JOB THAT I DO EVERY DAY AND THE PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT I CHANGE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT HE- VETERANS CORD IS ANOTHER PROGRAM I'M GETTING TIMED OUT. VETERANS CORD IS ANOTHER PROGRAM WE WON IN THAT IS ALSO FOR WOMEN THERE'S LESS COMMON IN THAT PROGRAM. AND OUT OF THE PHOENIX. AS IN OTHER PROGRAMS BROWN BALL DÂN AND N. O. D. R. I DON'T DO DR BUT THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM SO. JUST OFFICE OF DIVERSION OF RE ENTRY. SOMEONE TO TALK ABOUT IT. SO I. INJUSTICES THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED AND I HOPE THAT HELPS. SO BEFORE BY DEGREES SPEAKS I WANTED TO SAY TWO THINGS I ASKED IF YOU COULD SAY WHAT DR IS BECAUSE WE ARE LIVE STREAMING AND NOT EVERYONE WILL KNOW THE ACT. THAT IT'S JUST A GOOD REMINDER AND THEN ALSO JUST WANTED TO LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER THIS PANEL IN ALL OF YOUR STATEMENTS WILL BE RECORDED AND PUT IN THE FILE SO I DIDN'T WANT FOLKS TO FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU IN THE AUDIENCE. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS BOBBY GRACE I AM ALSO A DEPUTY DESCRIPTOR ANY. WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I'VE BEEN. IN THE OFFICE. LONGER THAN CAME I'VE BEEN THAT. AND THE OFFICE EVEN LIKE IT WHILE. THIRTY ONE YEARS. SO I CAN TALK ABOUT. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FORM I'M MORE. OVERALL VIEW. I DO FEEL A LITTLE TREPIDATION BECAUSE I'M LIKE THE ONLY MAN HERE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN INCARCERATIONS THAT. SO RIGHT NOW I OUR OF OUR OFFICES WRONGFUL CONVICTION SO. INDIVIDUALS WHO FEEL THAT THEY ARE FACTUALLY INNOCENT THEY CAN MAKE A CLAIM WITH OUR PARTICULAR UNIT AND ON. AND WE WILL IF IT HAS MERIT WILL DO AN INVESTIGATION. AND IF WE GET THE GO AHEAD AND IT WILL GO TO A JUDGE AND ASK A JUDGE TO VACATE THE CONVICTIONS SO THAT. IS PART OF A LARGER NARRATIVE THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT. A LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE CALIFORNIA. LEGISLATURE AND SO YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS ASSEMBLY PERSON AND YOU KNOW ALL OF HER COLLEAGUES IN A STATE GOVERNMENT HAVE LED THE CHARGE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS KIM SAID EVERYBODY'S NOT WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON THE PROSECUTION SIDE IS NOT ON BOARD WITH THIS YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. BUT WHERE THE MONEY GOES WHERE MONEY GOES FORCES CHANGE AND SO A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN COMING INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FROM THE STATE. AND ALSO FROM LOCALLY FROM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS GONE TO THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT KIM IS TALKING ABOUT ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND THAT IS HAVING MONUMENTAL CHANGE WITHIN THE CROWDS AS A SYSTEM I CAN TELL YOU TODAY. THAT. DAD LIVES ARE BEING CHANGED ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE- OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE GOING ON WITHIN THE SYSTEM. BUT ALSO TO TALK ABOUT IT FROM THIS BROAD VIEW. SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME OF THE WOMEN WHO GAVE TESTIMONY TODAY. SO CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES THAT INSTITUTION DID THE FEDERAL OF QUIBBLING OF MANDATORY MINUTES MINIMUM. MANDATORY SENTENCING. WHERE WE INSTITUTED. SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT SO WHERE IF YOU WERE CONVICTED OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CRIMES. AND YOU WERE CHARGED WITH AN ENHANCEMENT IT ADDED TIME AND THEN ALL OF YOU KNOW ABOUT THREE STRIKES. IN SO ALL OF THAT JUST BECAME CONASON ARMY WITH IN CALIFORNIA WHERE PEOPLE WERE WHO WERE. CONVICTED OF VIOLENT CRIMES. STARTED DOING IN ORDER IN AN AMOUNT OF TIME. IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER THIS SUBSTANTIVE CRIME THEY HAVE BECAUSE OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING WITH SOME OF THE WOMEN WERE TALK ABOUT I WAS DOUBLE CHARGED OR I THIS IN HERE I GOT THAT'S ENHANCEMENT THAT'S HOW THEY WERE GETTING THE AT THE TYPE OF TIME THAT THEY WERE GETTING. NOW THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WITH IN THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE JUDGES ARE GETTING. DISCRETION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE TO IMPOSE THE SENTENCING HAMMOND THAT'S A MAJOR SEA CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA. ALSO THE THROUGH THE REFORM EFFORTS AT THE STATE LEVEL NOW STATE COURTS CAN GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF VIOLENT CRIMES. AND DETERMINE WHETHER THEY QUALIFY FOR RE SENTENCING. SOME OF THAT IS DUE TO. BILL US US SENATE BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHICH IS. OUR PENAL CODE PILOTS IS WHAT YOU COM I KNOW IT'S FELONY MURDER. THAT'S BEEN A BIG CHANGE WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO COME BACK FOR THAT AND ALSO. HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT CRIMES CAN COME BACK AND ASK FOR RE SENTENCING FOR ISSUES LIKE. THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BEING TRAFFICKED. IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND OR THEY WERE THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE PERSON THAT THEY KILLED WAS A PERPETRATOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON THEM. SO THAT'S BEEN A BIG CHANGE IN AND THAT GOES TO RIGHT TO THE HEART OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE A LOT OF WOMEN THAT AS YOU HEARD THAT COME THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR VIOLENT CRIMES. UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF TIMES A DAY BEEN SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED. AND OR THEY WERE THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE CRIME THAT THE PERPETRATOR WAS AGAINST THE PER PERSON WHO PERPETRATED CRIME AGAINST THEM. I THINK IN THE LONG RUN. WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IN A AND THE LEGISLATURE IS TALKING ABOUT IT BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT PROBLEM IS. THE BIG ISSUE OUT THERE IS BE ALL REFORM. AND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND IT. BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES INVOLVED WE WANT THE COMMUNITY BE TO BE SAFE. BUT WE WANT INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT AND TO FIGHT THEIR CASE. ON A FAIR BASIS AND SO WE EVERYBODY WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEIR ARMS AROUND IT AND HAVE IN IT TO BE DONE IN A FAIR. MANNER WHETHER IT'S SOME FORM OF MONEY BUILT WHETHER IT'S A NO BAIL. MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT IF YOU HAVE NO NO MONEY BAIL. THAT JUDGES WILL JUST DEFAULT TO KEEPING EVERYBODY IN BECAUSE THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE SAFEST THING TO DO. SO THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS. OF BAIL REFORM AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE DO THIS WE DON'T DO IT PIECEMEAL THAT WE DO IT WITH A GREAT STUDY AND THAT WE DO IT RIGHT. SO THAT PEOPLE ARE FAIRLY TREATED AND THAT'S ONE THING I WANT TO SAY THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT IN TERMS OF THIS WHOLE AREA OF THE WOMEN INCARCERATION. KIM ALLUDED TO THIS BUT WE NEED. IN THAT WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE NEED THE MONEY. TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE MANDATED BY THE REFORMS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO. IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT. TO FIGHT THEIR CRIME THEY NEED TO HAVE TO PLACE TO GO TO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIVERT SOMEBODY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS OR BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE DRUG ADDITION. THEY NEED TO HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO WHERE THEY THEY CAN GET TREATMENT. AND THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING BACK OUT ON THE STREET AND COMMITTING A CRIME BECAUSE OF THE MENTAL ILLNESS THAT THEY'RE FACING OR BECAUSE THAT THE DEMONS THAT THEY'RE FACING WITH RESPECT TO ADDICTION. AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE TALK ABOUT WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE. MONEY ATTACH ANYTIME A BILL. IS PASSED WHERE WERE MANDATING REFORM THERE NEEDS TO BE MONEY ATTACHED TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS TREMENDOUS I THINK THIS IS A GREAT THING. THE OTHER THING I WILL SAY IS THAT. THE LAST THING ON A SAY IS THAT STATISTICS. ARE SO IMPORTANT WITH HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING WHAT WE DO WITH IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND I SEE ISAAC IS IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM. HE'S BEEN A BIG PROPONENT OF THIS AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE CHAINS THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING. LOCALLY HERE HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY. THE MONEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT UP FOR IT. A DATA DRIVEN WORK. AND THAT'S GOT TO CONTINUE PARTICULARLY IN THIS SPACE BECAUSE OF THE MORE DATA THAT WE HAVE AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE WOMEN. IN PRISONS. WHY THEY MAY NOT BE GETTING BAIL WHY THEY MAKE I HAVE GOTTEN A PARTICULAR SENTENCE THAT THEY GOT. THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE AMMUNITION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. A DATA DRIVEN REFORMS THAT ARE SO NECESSARY WITH IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND I WANTED TO SAY THAT. WHAT I HEARD THIS AFTERNOON WAS JUST. HEART WRENCHING. AND OPENED UP MY EYES TO THE NEW KIM YOU SEE IT EVERY DAY I'VE TRIED LIKE A HUNDRED MURDER CASES. AND I YOU KNOW I DON'T DEAL ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AS MMR CAREER I DON'T DEAL WITH THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF IT I'M DEALING WITH IT WITH. OKAY THIS PERSON COMMITTED MURDER I'M TRYING TO GET THEM YOU KNOW. BUT I'VE ALWAYS IN MY HEART ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS BETTER THAN THE WORST DAY THAT THERE EVER HAD AND THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NEEDS. TO LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL ON A EACH PERSON ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. OF WHAT MAY HAVE BROUGHT THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE DOESN'T MEAN. THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE PUNISHED IF THEY ACTUALLY COMMITTED A CRIME. WELL ALL EVERYBODY THAT COMES WITHIN THE CRITICAL JUST AS JUSTICE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. IN ORDER. HELLO GREAT HI GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS VANESSA MARTIN AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE RE ENTRY DIVISION AT THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION REENTRY SO I CAN TELL YOU ALL A LITTLE BIT OFFICE OF DIVERSION REENTRY. I JUST WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. AND A TO A TO MY FRIENDS HERE BUT SHE WAS ADAM SOMEWHERE WANDERING AROUND VERY I GOT AND I REALLY WANT TO THINK THAT THE PANEL THAT WAS HERE IN MY FRIENDS WERE ON THE PANEL INGRID AND SERRA. YOUR STORIES ARE AMAZING INSPIRING AND HEART WRENCHING AND THE FACT THAT YOU. HAVE TAKEN ALL YOUR EXPERIENCES AND ARE NOW HELPING OTHERS WHO ARE IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS YOURSELVES IS JUST SOMETHING THAT I'M COMPLETELY HUMBLED BY AND JUST GRATEFUL THAT I CAN BE HERE IN SUPPORT YOUR- AMAZING WORK THAT YOU DO. SO THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION REENTRY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH US IS A BOARD OF SUPERVISOR CREATED OFFICE HERE CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THREE FOUR YEARS OLD NOW SO TODDLERS I SUPPOSE AND WE WERE CREATED IN AN EFFORT TO DIVERT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OUT OF THE COUNTY JAILS AND INTO COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT. I'M SORRY REALLY SEE OURSELVES AS THE AS REALLY THE CONDUIT BETWEEN PUBLIC SECTOR BETWEEN COUNTY PART THE COUNTY AGENCIES AND THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES AND- BECOME HEALTHIER. ON HUMAN BEINGS AND REALLY YOU KNOW REFORM THEMSELVES IN TRANSFORM THEMSELVES ON THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS SO THAT'S THE OLD THE MOST OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IT WOULD BE OUR- AND WE HAVE A LARGE BODY OF WORK ON THE DIVERSION SIDE AND I AND LEAD. OR RE ENTRY WORK WHICH IS A MASSIVE MASSIVE BODY OF WORK AS YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE THERE'S THIRTY THOUSAND BUDGET RENTAL. FELONY IN AN ALLEY. LOAN THAT'S. AND THEN. THERE'S JUST FOUND OUT THE STATISTICS TODAY FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SO THANKS TO THE SHERIFF. THERE WERE. THEN ON PEOPLE THERE'S TWO THOUSAND WOMEN IT'S C. R. D. F. IN ANY GIVEN DAY. SO YOU KNOW THESE. ASTRONAUTS NUMBERS AND THE AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR WOMEN SEEM TO BE INCREASING. AND SO. YOU KNOW WE REALLY SEE OUR CHARGES AS DEVELOPING PROGRAMMING FOR WOMEN WHEN THEY ARE COMING OUT OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT COULD BE ANYBODY WHO IS ON PROBATION THAT'S ANYONE WHO'S COMING BACK FROM STATE PRISON ON PAROLE. ON THIS ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY MAYBE FOR QUITE A BIT OF TIME IN MAY BE UNDER NO SUPERVISION. BUT ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN IMPACTED BY THE SYSTEM. SO I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WE'RE DOING. AT DR ONE OF THE BIG INITIATIVES JUST ON OUR OUR IN OUR DIVERSION SIDE CONSERVE CAN GIVE A SHOUT OUT. TO MY COLLEAGUES THE DIVERSION CENTER MEDICAL DIRECTOR DR CHRIS NO CHIRLA. IS LEADING MANY EFFORTS ARE BASED TO EFFORTS. I'M FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD FROM SEVERE MEANT. HEALTH ISSUES. INTO A HIGH MENTAL HEALTH THE CUTIE ISSUES. AND ONE OF THE ONE OF THE INITIATIVES THIS WAS A BOARD OF SUPERVISOR DIRECTIVE. WAS TO DIVERT WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT OUT OF THE JAILS. AND INTO TREATMENT INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT. AND SERVICES SO I JUST ACTUALLY GOT THE STATS YOU ALSO AFTER EXCUSE ME I WAS ASKED TO DO THIS IN THE ELEVENTH HOUR. OUR DIRECTOR JUDGES BUT NO THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. SO I'M DOING MY BEST. TO FILL AND A WOMAN SO I FEEL LIKE IN A- THE. IN ANSWER REALLY REALLY THRILLED ABOUT THAT IN AGAIN I GOT INFORMATION FROM COMMANDER ON. TARA ORDER THIS MORNING AND SHE INFORMED ME THAT. BUT THERE ARE CURRENTLY THIRTY FIVE PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE JAIL AND SHE SAID. SHE SEEN THESE NUMBERS TO BE MUCH MUCH HIGHER SO I THIRTY FIVE IS A- HUGE IMPROVEMENT. BUT AGAIN. STILL STILL ON A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. SO I AM I HAVE A LOT OF TALKING POINTS I TRIED TO THROW TOGETHER PRETTY QUICKLY. BUT I CAN ALSO JUST ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. THAT YOU RAISED. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO REFORM THE SYSTEM. WHAT I PERSONALLY SEE HOW I VIEW THIS WORK. I VERY MUCH SEE IT THROUGH A BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS. HUMAN RIGHTS LANDS MY AGE. MY WORK STARTED A VERY EARLY AGE FIGHTING FOR A BROTHER WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY IN A HOME FILLED WITH VIOLENCE. AND I WASN'T. A FIGHTER BY NATURE BUT I HAD TO FIGHT. FOR HIM AND FIGHT FOR OTHERS AND SO WE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WHO MAYBE FIGHTERS BY NATURE BUT HAS HAD TO COME BY IT. UNDER YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR THAT MUCH MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT WORK HAS LED ME. THROUGH MANY MANY SYSTEMS FIGHTING FOR HIM IN FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE IN SITUATIONS LIKE HIM. AND ULTIMATELY STARTED MY CAREER TWENTY YEARS AGO AND CRIMINALS ARE. ACTUALLY BACK IN NEW YORK CITY FIGHTING FOR ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. IN THE NINETIES UNDER THE FILLER DRUG LAWS. AND SO THIS IS BEEN A PASSION OF MINE FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE. TWO MINUTES SO I WILL SAY THAT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO. REFORM THE SYSTEM DOES WORK WITH COMMUNITIES THE COMMUNITIES NO THIS WORK I THINK IT'S OUR JOB IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITIES THAT DO THIS WORK AND I WILL ALSO SUPPORT MY OTHER PANELISTS AND- IN THE DISCUSSION AND THE- THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT WE NEED MORE DATA. SO IT AGAIN HUGE HUGE STEP SHOUT OUT TO MILLION DOLLAR HOODS AND THE ABILITY TO GET THE DATA OUT OF THE SHARE OF SYSTEM. AND DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL WITH IT AND ANALYZE IT IN A WAY THAT'S USEFUL TO ALL OF US. WHO ARE DOING THIS WORK I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT DATA HER HANDS IN OUR FINGER TIPS. BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE WE NEED TO SET YOU KNOW HIGH STANDARDS AND CONTINUE TO DO CONTINUES CAN IMPROVE AND I THINK. SO A TIME. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS C. C. PUBLIC SECTOR GOVERNMENT FUNDERS AS COMING INTO AUDIT AND KIND OF SLAP THEM ON THE WRIST AND WE REALLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A VERY DIFFERENT. APPROACH TO THIS AND THAT IS ALL THROUGH CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. AND THAT WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT YOU CANNOT PENALIZE ON THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. AND SAID HELP SUPPORT IT THROUGH THROUGH THE ON THURSDAY AB. I THINK THE BIG THING TOO IS. SOME OF THE ANDREAS IS KIND OF BREAKING THE SILOS. IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES RIGHT. HELLO TO ALL THE HOUSE IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW. HEY WE ALL. HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE THOSE RESOURCES YOU KNOW IT'S SQUEEZE OUT AS MUCH OF IT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. AND I THINK BREAKING THE SILENCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK DR IS. REALLY UNIQUELY POSITIONED IN THAT WAY BECAUSE WE ARE REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE. PEOPLE POPULATION RATHER THAN SERVICES MANY MANY DEPARTMENTS ARE USUALLY DESIGNED BASED ON FUNDING STREAMS BASED ON SERVICES AND THAT'S AND THAT'S ALL GREAT. BUT WHAT WE FIND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A WE ARE IS WE HAVE TO FOCUS WE HAVE A FOCUS ON THE POPULATION AND SERVING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. AND THAT TRANSCENDS ALL OF THE COUNTY AGENCIES SO WE HAVE TO. IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO LEVERAGE WHAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR WORK IS REALLY TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS SILOS AND GET TO THE HEART OF IT WHICH IS. MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE CLIENTS AND HEARING FROM THEM I THINK. ANOTHER THING THAT'S A CRITICALLY CRITICAL CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THE WORK THAT WE STARTED TO DO IT AGAIN SO GRATEFUL. TO SERRA AND INGRID AND OTHERS WHO WE WORK WITH REALLY CLOSELY WE STARTED A- AND I'M TRYING TO WATCH MY- SHE WATCHED HER FOR THE TIME RIGHT. ON AN INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROGRAM AND REALLY REALLY PROUD AND PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE ARE NOW. AT ALMOST THIRTY COMMUNITY WORKING WITH A THIRTY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS LA BY THE END OF THE YEAR WILL HAVE A HUNDRED. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE OF LIVED EXPERIENCE OF INCARCERATION. WHICH IS HUGE AND THAT IS IT IS HUGE RIGHT I CAN'T REALLY I DON'T HAVE ANY BETTER KIND OF. WORD OR ARTICULATION FOR THAT BUT IT'S SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THOSE EXPERIENCES I'LL BE THE ADVOCATES IN THE MENTORS. IT'S VERY MUCH A WHATEVER TAKES APPROACH SO I MEAN SERICA. FOR DATE WILL BE ABOUT ALL THE WORK THAT THEY DO WORKING WITH THESE CLIENTS SO I THINK THAT IS THE FACT THAT THE WORK NEEDS TO BE. FORMED BODY CLIENTS BUT ALSO DRIVEN DECLINE AND HAVING MORE. PEOPLE EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY DOING THIS WORK AT THE TABLE I THINK IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND I SEE MY JOB IS JUST HELPING TO. THAT BRING OUT OF HUMILITY IN AS MUCH FOR. EIGHT AND LONG HOURS SUPPORT WORK I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT. I WANTED TO COVER. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER PRESS. YEAH WHICH AGAIN THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL I WANTED SOARED OFF ALL KNOW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS APOLOGIZED BUT HEARING THE STORIES OF ALL OF THOSE PUBLIC DEFENDERS DOTS REPRESENT YOU BROKE MY HEART. AND I APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU WHO FELT HARMED OR IGNORED OR NOT HEARD OR NOT CARED ABOUT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AVOID DEFENDER FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS AND I KNEW WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL WHAT MY GOAL WAS TO BE I CHOSE MY LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CLINIC AND I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO REPRESENT TEENAGERS WHO ARE CHARGED WITH CRIMES. AND THAT'S WHY SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE FIGHTING TO DO. I WAS OFFERED A JOB IN A WALL STREET LAW FIRM AND I TURNED IT DOWN IN FACT TO DO THIS AND SO WHEN I FIRST STARTED REPRESENTING CLIENTS. THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO I GOT WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR BODY. THEY WOULD TELL ME WELL I WANT YOU KNOW I WANT A REAL LAWYER. AND I JUST SORT OF THROW UP MY HANDS YOU KNOW START. I AM A REAL LAWYER AND- WE START WITH THAT PREJUDICE AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME. BUT I BELIEVE THAT. MY JOB IS A SACRED MISSION AND I TAKE IT. THAT WAY AND I FIND I HAVE. IN EVERY SINGLE CLIENT THAT I'VE EVER REPRESENTED. I BELIEVE HAS. HOPEFULLY FELT THAT WAY THAT I AM COMMITTED TO THAT. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY. FOR A LOT OF REASONS THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THE ONES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT AS WELL SO. THAT'S MY APOLOGIES. SO I. WANT TO SEE THAT CAME TO THE ALTERNATE HOW DEFENDER'S OFFICE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO BECAUSE- AT THAT POINT IN TIME WE HAD BEEN FIGHTING A SYSTEM FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS WHERE HALF OF THE KIDS WHO WERE ARRESTED IN. LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'RE GIVEN A PANEL ATTORNEY WHO WAS PAID THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A CASE. AND THAT WAS IT. AND AS A RESULT THEY WERE GETTING BASICALLY NO REPRESENTATION. SO I CAME TO ALTERNATE PUT DEFENDERS OFFICE TRY TO HELP THEM GET THE CONTRACT AND ULTIMATELY. THE BOARD FINALLY DID THAT THREE YEARS AGO AND I JUST WANNA SEE WE NOW HAVE TWENTY FIVE LAWYERS. MOST OF THE LAWYERS 95% OF LAWYERS IN MY UNIT. OUR EXPERIENCED FAMILY LAWYERS WHO ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE OR THERE TO STAY. WE HAVE CHANGE THINGS AROUND SO MUCH THAT ABOUT. FOUR YEARS AGO. KIDS WERE GOING TO ADULT COURT KIDS WERE BEING TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT ABOUT. 75% OF THE ONES WHO WERE FILED ON WE'RE GOING TO ADULT COURT. MY OFFICE NOW HAS CHANGED THAT OF ALL OF THE CLIENTS THAT WE REPRESENTED. JUVENILE COURT SO WE ARE CHANGING THE MISSION. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS IS A LOT OF GOOD NEWS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT JUVENILE CRIME AND DESPITE WHAT PEOPLE THINK IN HERE GENERAL CRIME IS DOWN. BY SEVENTY PERCENT. ARE WE HAVE CLOSED DOWN VIRTUALLY CLOSED DOWN MANY OF THE JUVENILE PRISONS WITHDRAWN FROM. TRUE WHAT TEN THOUSAND KIDS IN JUVENILE PRISON TWENTY YEARS AGO. TO LESS THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WE HAVE JUVENILE HALLS AND CAMPS CLOSING. AND WE'VE HAD AMAZING LEGISLATION WE HAVE ALL OF THE THINGS AROUND. JUVENILES WERE SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE NOW GETTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PAROLE. WE HAVE CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE NO LONGER IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM MY GOD HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE TO FIGURE OUT. WE NO LONGER HAVE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS. GOING TO ADULT COURT SO THERE'S BEEN SOME REALLY MAJOR CHANGES ON THE STATE LEVEL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER. I'M WHEN ALSO ON THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE ELIMINATED SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR JUVENILES WE'RE IN THE PROCESS THE LIVES OF ELIMINATING PEPPER SPRAY. WE ARE NOW STUDYING HOW TO REMOVE PROBATION FROM THE OVERSIGHT OF JUVENILES BECAUSE OF THE FAILED. SYSTEM THAT WE'VE HAS DEVELOPED AND WE ARE POSSIBLY WRITTEN MOVING TOWARDS MORE HARM REDUCTION MEDICAL MODEL NOT ONLY FOR THE KIDS IN THE LOCAL SYSTEM BUT ALSO. GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S PLANNING TO REMOVE DJJ FROM CDC ARE INTO A POTENTIALLY DEVELOP TO DEPART HEALTH SERVICES SO ALL THAT IS GREAT NEWS. BUT THEY'RE STILL BAD NEWS AND BECAUSE WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT GIRLS AND WOMEN. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THE PROPORTION OF GIRLS IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS INCREASED. AT EVERY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. I DON'T MEAN THE NUMBER OF GIRLS IS AS I'VE SAID THE CRIME LEVEL HAS GONE DOWN BUT THE PROPORTION HAS RISEN. AND THAT'S OVER ALL STAGES THE PROCEEDINGS ARREST DETENTION AND PROBATION. AND THE OTHER BAD NEWS IS THAT THE GENDER GAP IS TREMENDOUS IN THE DETENTION OF GIRLS FOR REALLY LOW LEVEL CRIMES YOU LOOK AT. WHO'S DETAINED FOR LOW LEVEL CRIMES THE PERCENTAGE IS MUCH HIGHER FEMALE PERCENTAGE. WE ALSO KNOW AND I THINK ANY. ONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT. THE REASON GIRLS AND UP IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. 31% OF THE STUDY FOR TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN REPORTED A PERSONAL EXPRESSES SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THE HOME FORTY OVER 40% HAVE BEEN FITTED PHYSICALLY ABUSED REPORT SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE RATE OF OVER FOUR AND A HALF TIMES THAT OF BOYS COMING INTO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THAT TELLS US A LOT. ABOUT WHY GIRLS ARE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ALSO ABOUT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS TO ME IT MEANS THAT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT THE PLACE. TO HEAL. ANYBODY BUT ESPECIALLY TO HEAL TRAUMATIZED KIDS SO MY NUMBER ONE SUGGESTION FOR REFORM IS KEEP US OUT OF IT I MEAN I LOVE MY JOB. WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW I'M GONNA RETIRED A COUPLE YEARS AND MIGHT YOU KNOW KEEP US OUT OF IT BECAUSE WE DON'T DO IT WELL IT'S NOT OUR PURPOSE SO I AM REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THE- EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THE TREMENDOUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION RE ENTRY. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THAT NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SORT OF DIVERT IN NAME BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BACKING IT UP WITH LISTENING TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD DO IT. I THINK ANOTHER SUGGESTION THAT I HAVE AND I AND I THINK APRIL STORY TOUCHED ME SO MUCH BECAUSE- AS HORRIBLE AS IT IS. IT IS SO TYPICAL. IT IS JUST IT'S A. IT'S SOMETHING I HEAR DAY IN AND DAY OUT ABOUT HOW. THIS THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. AND I GO THERE EVERY TWO WEEKS AND I REPRESENT KIDS WHO ARE DAHLE STATUS KIDS KIDS WERE CROSSED OVER. AND I'M JUST. I'M JUST BLOWN AWAY THAT PART OF IT IS BECAUSE IT'S VERY SECRET CONFIDENTIAL AND THE PROCEEDINGS ARE CLOSE SOMETIMES FOR VERY GOOD REASONS BUT- I'M BLOWN AWAY AT AT OUR OUR- OUR WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW THIS TO GO ON I MEAN THE SYSTEM'S BROKEN. THE TOURNEY'S HAVE HUNDREDS OF CASES THEY- REALLY CAN'T DO ANYTHING THEIR PARALYZED FROM BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. THE THERE'S NO TRAUMA SCREENING IT MANDATORY FOR KIDS IT SHOULD BE FOR EVERY KID THE SHIP EVERY KID SHOULD HAVE EDUCATIONAL SCREENING YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY KIDS COME TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THEY'VE NEVER HAD NINETY P. THEY'VE NEVER HAD ANY BE LOOK AT OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM AND SEE WHAT WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEED SO THEIR FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN THEIR ENDING UP IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I THINK THE THIRD. SUGGESTION I HOUSES THAT IF YOU WITH WE DO HAVE THEM KIDS IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WE REALLY. NEED TO RE HALL WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY FEW OPTIONS. YOU GO HOME OPERATION GO TO CIVIL PLACEMENT WHICH IS A GROUP HOME WHICH IS A TERRIBLE IDEA. YOU CAN GO TO CAMP YOU CAN GO TO PRISON. THAT'S BASICALLY IT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED. AND MORE YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE THAN ACCESS TO SERVICES. WHICH IS A BIG THING. I THINK THAT. WHAT WE NEED IS THAT WHAT I SAID HARM REDUCTION POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT MODEL I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GIVE GIRLS YOUNG WOMEN SELF ESTEEM. A SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT AND INDEPENDENCE AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS BEING IS GEARED TOWARDS SUBMISSION OBEDIENCE AND TO A VERY PATRIARCHAL. AT A STORE TATE OF MODEL. SO THIS IS A SMALL LITTLE CHANGES YOU KNOW LET'S JUST. CAME THROUGH. THANK YOU SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY AND FOR YOUR COURAGE AND BOTH TALKING ABOUT YOUR WORK AND THE EFFORTS THAT YOU SEE AHEAD WE'RE GOING TO NOW OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO I WANT FOLKS TO KIND OF. I GUESS LINE UP HERE WE GO. AND WHILE WE DO THAT. I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS MYSELF. WE HAVE BEEN MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE BATTLE IS UP THE HILL THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS THAT ARE STILL ON THE BOOKS AND SO WHILE WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW BILL REFORM THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS SENTENCING REFORM. AND OUR BIGGEST OPPOSITION ACTUALLY COME FROM THAT THE D. A.'S AND SO WE THERE'S ALSO WHEN I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED THIS IN YOUR COMMENTS IT'S AS MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND RESOURCES AS IT IS ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY I'M GOING TO FUND THIS IF WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE FUNDING A SYSTEM THAT WE ALL KNOW TO BE BROKEN WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCES THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF CULTURAL CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM. AND SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO THAT AND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ACCEPT AND EMBRACE MORE JUDICIAL DISCRETION WIN IT REVEALS ITSELF IN SENTENCING DISPARITIES YOU SEE AND SORROW PEOPLE USE DESCRIPTIVE JUDGES WILL USE THEIR DISCRETION YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN FOLKS AND NOT FOR OTHERS AND I THINK THAT THE BROCK TURNER CASE WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF AN OUTRAGE. WITH A JUDGE USING JUDICIAL DISCRETION BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ALL IT WAS USED FOR THIS WHITE MAN. AND NOT IN ANY OTHER CASE THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THAT WAY AND SO HOW DO WE REALLY HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RACE AND CLASS AND GENDER IN THIS SYSTEM. AND THEN THE FINAL THING IS YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS ON PROBATION A REALLY LONG TIME. I MEAN I CAN HARDLY GO TWO WEEKS ON A DIET WITHOUT MAKING. IT SO DO YOU THINK SOMEONE IS GOING TO GO IF YEARS WITHOUT. YOU KNOW IT IT'S BREAKING A VIOLATE IT'S A VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF ANY LONG JAY WALKING J. WORKING. AND SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF HAVE REAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IF THAT'S EVEN DESIGNED TO HAVE PEOPLE REHABILITATE IF I'M BEING WATCHED FOR FIVE YEARS. THERE'S NO WAY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY KIND OF MISTAKE ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND SO WHAT ARE WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT. BUT I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT ALL OF US ARE IN THIS FIGHT TOGETHER AND WE'RE COMING AT IT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES AND WE DO NEED TO SUPPORTER DA'S OFFICES AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT A PUBLIC DEFENDERS BECAUSE SPENDING SEVEN MINUTES ON AVERAGE WITH THE CLIENT. IS NOT GOING TO GET BACK LINE DUE PROCESS I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FIND TO PROCESS AND SEVEN MINUTES. AND SO WE HAVE TO HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. AND WHO GETS A PUBLIC DEFENDER AND WHO DOESN'T. SO WITH THAT I AM GOING TO ALSO SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS ON OUR SECOND ONE WILL HAPPEN IN FEBRUARY AND- ALL IN THAT HEARING WE WILL ACTUALLY DELVE INTO THE EXPERIENCES. OF WOMEN WHILE INCARCERATED SO WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN PRISON AND IN JAIL AND THE TRAUMAS IN THE MISTREATMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM FROM ALL SIDES. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO OPEN IT UP. PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU HAVE NINETY SECONDS THIS WILL BE JUST LIKE A HEARING. WELL THIS IS A HEARING SO PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND MY NAME IS THE THAT READS AND UNFORTUNATELY MY FAMILY MEMBER WAS ONE THAT DID NOT GET A GOOD PUBLIC DEFENDER HE IS SERVING HIS THIRTY SEVENTH YEAR OF A TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR YEAR SENTENCE NO PRIOR CONVICTIONS. HE WAS EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME SOCIAL FINALLY GET. A CONSULTATION HEARING FOR YOUTH PAROLE HEARING BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY HELP AND WE DID DO THE DA CONVICTION REVIEW. IT WAS DENIED BECAUSE THEY SAID THERE WAS NO NEW EVIDENCE SO IS THERE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE IF THERE IS ACTUAL INNOCENCE AND YOU GUYS ARE JUST DENYING IT BECAUSE YOU SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE NEW EVIDENCE. THAT'S NOT A CASE REVIEW AND THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS WRONG WITH THAT CASE NO PRIOR CONVICTIONS I MEAN IT IT'S A KID THAT HAS BEEN IN PRISON FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEAR. SO ARE YOU AND WHAT WAS IT IN LA COUNTY YES. AND WHEN WAS IT WHEN WAS THE STATE NINE HI TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE WERE LIKE ONE OF THE FIRST CASES TO APPLY FOR THE D. HAVE CONVICTION REVIEW AND THE CALIFORNIA INNOCENCE PROJECT HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET INFORMATION FROM YOUR OFFICE WE HAVE MOTIONS. EVERYTHING IN YOUR OFFICE IS JUST NOT. FIND WITH A THE ORDERS I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD. BEFORE EVEN YOU CAN. IF JUST TELL BY NOW RESUBMIT IT AND I'LL I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT WE APPRECIATE IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR SOME OF THOSE BECAUSE- THERE MAY BE SOME CONSTITUENT CASE WORK THAT POPS UP. THAT WE WOULD LOVE FOR OUR PANELISTS TO STAYS SO THAT FOLKS CAN MAYBE ASK SOME MORE PERSONAL QUESTIONS AND GET. PHONE NUMBERS ARE RESOURCES THAT YOU ALL HAVE SO THAT PEOPLE ARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT IS WHEN PEOPLE COME BEFORE US FOR. WRONGFUL CONVICTION CLAIMS. ONE OF THE STANDARD OR ONE OF THE CRITERIA IS THAT YOU HAVE HAVE NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE ORIGINAL JURY DIDN'T HEAR. AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THAT CRITERIA IS BECAUSE FOR A JUDGE TO OVERTURN A CONVICTION. THE LEGAL STANDARD IS. IF THE REGIONAL JURY KNEW WHAT THEY KNEW NOW WOULD THEY HAVE REACHED A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION AND SO WE'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW. TO GIVE THE JUDGE IN ORDER TO CONVINCE THE JUDGE THAT. PERHAPS THIS IS THE ORIGINAL JURY IS WRONG BECAUSE. THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS A LOW. TO OVERTURN CONVICTIONS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SECOND GUESS THE JUDGMENT OF JURY I AM WE PROVIDED NEW EVIDENCE BUT IT WAS STILL TONIGHT. AND HE SAID IT WAS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN CORRECT OKAY YEAH DEFINITELY SEEN ME BEFORE. THANK YOU. HEY WE MUST MAKE A MOTEL THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR COMING AND PARTICIPATING I'M ALSO FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMAN AND SO MY DUTY HERE TODAY IS TO IS TO BRING IN THE SISTERS THAT ARE STILL SITTING INSIDE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EVERYTHING ONE OF US ARE HERE DOING THE WORK IS DOING A FOR US TO BRING OUR FOLKS HOME AND TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE CONDITIONS. THAT ARE CURRENTLY HAPPENING IMPRISONED SO REALLY WANTING TO ADDRESS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF WENT THROUGH THE LIST OF HOW WE GET BROKEN OFF OF THESE BIG LONG SENTENCES YOU KNOW SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS AND DOUBLE SENTENCES AND ALL THIS AND A NUMBER OF FOLKS HAVE ADDRESSED THE TRAUMA THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE IN PRISON YOU JUST MENTIONED BROCK TURNER SO I WANTED TO SPEAK UP AND ASK WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS IN CA WCCW F. THAT ARE BEING CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS. BUT BEING CONVICTED OF SEX WITHIN IN ME RATHER THAN RAPE WALKING AWAY WITH TWO DAYS IN JAIL AND TWO YEARS PROBATION I WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT'S HAPPENING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND HOW IS THAT DAY THE ONES WITH THE KEYS TO OURSELVES AND THE WAS A CONTROL WHETHER OR NOT WE PICK UP THE PHONE AND TALK TO OUR CHILDREN. OR VISIT OUR FAMILY AND OUR SITTING ROOMS. THAT THEY THAT THERE'S ANY SORT OF STRUCTURE IN PLACE IN PRISON FOR CONSENSUAL SEX. SO JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT. ARE YOU GUYS I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE BUT I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE KNOWLEDGE IS TO THAT. SOMEONE WRITE MY STUFF IS BEFORE YOU GO TO PRISON SO IT SOUNDS HALL AWFUL BECAUSE BECAUSE- AGAIN WE HAVE TO RELY ON YOU LIKE THIS IS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE. NONE OF US WANT TO PUSH FOR. FURTHERING HER SERRATION AND- PUSHING PEOPLE INTO THE SYSTEM. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO RELY ON RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR CRIMES BUT CORRECTION OFFICERS ARE WALKING AWAY. I THINK. I WILL ANSWER THIS I APPRECIATE YOU. A KNOWLEDGE IN THIS BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES AND I HAVE DONE TOURS OF PRISONS AND- NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT BUT THEN WE HEAR THE STORIES WE HEAR HOW PROGRAMS. ARE LEVERAGED RIGHT HOW WOMEN ARE LEVERAGE IF THEY WANTED TO A CERTAIN PROGRAM IN AND HOW THAT CAN BE CUT SHORT IF THEY'RE NOT DOING THINGS THAT THEY- ARE BEING ASKED TO DO THAT THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ASKED TO DO IF THEY WERE NOT INCARCERATED IN ORDER TO STAY IN A PROGRAMMER GET ADDITIONAL PRIVILEGES. THAT CON ASIAN IS REALLY FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN CDC ARE IN THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HAPPENING IN OUR NEXT HEARING BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES THAT WOMEN ARE HAVING WHILE THEY ARE IN JAIL AND WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON THIS HEARING IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO JAIL. WHAT OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY BE LED YOU TO BEING INCARCERATED BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO DISMANTLE AND FIX THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TO COME AT IT FROM MULTIPLE SITES AND THE LEG OF THIS THREE LIKE IT'S TOOL IS THE ENTRY POINT THE SECOND LEG IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE HOW ARE WOMEN ARE WOMEN A LET'S NOT ASSUME ARE WOMEN FURTHER DE HUMANIZED RIGHT AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND THEN THE THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME OUT WITH RE ENTRY HOW SUCCESSFUL IS YOUR RE ENTRY EXPERIENCE HOW ARE WE FAILING YOU SO HOW ARE WE FAILING YOU. TO FORCE YOU INTO A SYSTEM. OUR WE FAILING YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SYSTEM. HOW ARE WE FAILING WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THE SYSTEM NOW I HAVE TO CHECK MY OWN BIAS BECAUSE MAYBE WERE NOT FAILING IN MANY INSTANCES BUT I YOU KNOW I TO BEEN TRAUMATIZED AS SOMEONE WHO HASN'T EVEN BEEN IN THE SYSTEM BUT HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY SO MANY FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY IT. SO I'M ACKNOWLEDGING MY BIAS BUT THIS THIS PANEL IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS. WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT. GET YOU INTO JAIL AND INTO PRISON AND SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU TABLE THIS BECAUSE WE NEED YOU HERE IN FEBRUARY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT GOES ON SO THAT YOU'RE ASKING THAT OF FOLKS FROM CDC ARE IN YOU'RE ASKING THAT OF CO. AND SO WE PUT ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY CAN HEAL IN THE DARK AGREE THINK ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT SO. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S PARALLELS TO LEADING INTO THE SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S US OR WHETHER IT'S THE CORRECTION OFFICERS AND SO ACCOUNTABILITY AND DA ACCOUNTABILITY IS SUCH A HUGE PIECE OF THAT. THANK YOU. YEAH I DON'T. ACTUALLY LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON. SORRY I MAKERS QUESTION I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS MAYBE CONVERSATION IT CAN BE PICKED UP AGAIN IN FEBRUARY. I LOOK FORWARD TO RETURNING AT THAT POINT. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO GIVE A HUGE HEARTFELT AND DEEP THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS TO. ALL THE WOMEN WHO APPEAR TODAY TO SHARE. WE'VE HONORABLE STORIES REALLY HEART WARMING STORIES REALLY HOT. ENGINE STORIES AND INDEED HEARTWARMING STORIES OF RECOVERY AND STRENGTH. MY QUESTIONS RECTITUDE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN JUNE YOU VOTED TO PASS SB ONE THIRTY TWO OUT OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE THIS BILL PASSED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY BUT CURRENTLY INACTIVE. WHAT'S YOUR REQUIRES THAT ANY INMATES WHO DECLARES A TRANSGENDER IDENTITY BE HOUSED IN A PRISON DESIGNATED FOR MEN OR WOMEN BASED ON THAT INDIVIDUAL'S PREFERENCE. SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT CAN INTERVENE TO DENY THAT REQUEST FOR SPECIFIC AND ARTICULABLE REASON BUT THE REASON CANNOT BE THE ABSENCE OF A GENDER DYSPHORIA DIAGNOSIS OR ANY MEDICAL STEPS TOWARDS TRANSITION. ROLL HAS DEMONSTRATED WHAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE ABOUT PEOPLE ASSIGNED FEMALE AT BIRTH WHERE GENDER NON CONFORMING BEING ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE. NOT TO MENTION OTHER PEOPLE BORN FEMALE WHO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFIES WOMEN. SB ONE THIRTY TWO MAKES NO MENTION OF THE SAFETY AND PRIVACY RIGHTS OF FEMALE INMATES NOR ANY SYSTEMIC MEASURE TO PREVENT ABUSE OF THIS POLICY. I SEXUALLY VIOLENT MAN. THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION OF GENDER IDENTITY SPECIALIST TESTIFIED THAT IT IS NAIVE TO SUGGEST THAT NO MAN WHO ARE NOT GENUINELY TRANS GENDER. BUT HOW VIOLENT MOTIVES WILL PRETEND TO BE TRANSGENDER IN ORDER TO BE TRANSFERRED INTO WOMEN'S PRISONS AND IN FACT THIS HAS BEEN THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. MY QUESTION TO YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHY DID YOU VOTE TO PASS THIS BILL WITHOUT PROPER SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT IT'S NOT ABUSED BY PEOPLE WITH BAD INTENTIONS. SO NORMALLY WHAT HAPPENS IN PUBLIC COMMENT IN WE'VE STRAIGHT AWAY SO WILL HAVE TO SELF CORRECT IS THAT WE HAVE COMMON IN THE PEOPLE ON THE DÍAS DO NOT. RESPOND BECAUSE IT'S YOUR TIME I WILL SAY THAT I HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL BUT ULTIMATELY I VOTED FOR IT BECAUSE CDC ARE HAS BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL SENATOR WIENER. AND MEMBERS OF THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY ON THIS ISSUE WE ARE SEEING A GROWING NUMBER OF LGBTQ FOLKS WHO ARE BECOMING INCARCERATED AND- WE HAVE A RIGHT. TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW FOLKS IDENTIFIED AND HOW THEY WANT TO BE HOUSE. IF THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT BUT AS I STATED AT THE HEARING I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE ONE OF THE ONES THAT STEPS IN FRONT OF PROGRESS. AND MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW SOMETHING IS GOING TO GO DOWN WITHOUT GIVING IMPROPER SPACE TO SEE HOW IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED. A HELLO YEAH I ACTUALLY HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THAT AS WELL. SO HUESO WE'RE GOING TO THE COMMON WE'RE GOING TO JUST HAVE IT BE COMMENTS SO YOU SHOULD. DEFINITELY FEEL FREE TO ASK YOUR QUESTIONS BUT JUST RECOGNIZE THAT I WANT TO ALLOW FOR ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE TO SPEAK AND SO I MAY. I RESERVE THE RIGHT NOT TO RESPOND JUST SO THAT WE CAN A RESPECT THE TIME ABOUT SHOE BUT IN BE RESPECT THE TIME OF THE OTHER FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE SURE YES ALSO ROBERT GREASY HE MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT HOSTAGES ARE ARE VERY IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS SPACE. SPECIAL REGARDING WHAT HAPPENS TO WOMEN IN PRISON AND THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS PROCESS MORE DATA DRIVEN AND VANESSA MARTIN. HE ALSO MENTIONED HOW WE BASICALLY TO BE SUPPORTING AND NOTHING LESS COMMITTEES AND WE TO COLLECT MORE DATA AND ACCURATE DATA TO SERVE THEM BETTER. THE ISSUE THE BILL IS THAT OF THESE INMATES ARE BEING HOUSED A CLASSIFIED BUT GENDER IDENTITY AS OPPOSED TO BURKE SIX AND ANY CRIMES THE COMMISSION PRESENT. THEIR BEING TRACKED AND CATALOG CONSISTENT WITH A PERSON'S GENDER IDENTITY FOR EXAMPLE A MODE FOR A TRANSGENDER PERSON REYES A FEMALE INMATE WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS A FEMALE SEX OFFENDER. THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK HOW MANY MTF TRANSIENT ENDED IN MAYES ABUSE TREND I DID DE LOS TO ASSAULT HER US OR TECH FROM PRISONERS IT ALSO SECURE SYSTEM IN AGE. OF SIX OF US AGAINST WOMEN AND EROSION IS A BIT COIN. TO DATE AND EVIDENCE AS A BASIS OF PROTECTIONS. NOW. BOTH OF THESE THINGS CAN BE RECORDED LAST MONTH THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT GREETED US SEX AND GENDER IN. DATA WORKING GROUP. PLEDGING TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN BIRTH CENTERED RIGHT INTO THE- AND PUTTING BOTH OF THEM IN DATA COLLECTION IN ORDER TO. PROCESS HAVE CONSISTENTLY MEASURE INEQUALITY AND TACKLE DISCRIMINATION. AS OF FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR SINCE IT'S CAÑADA IN PREPARATION FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY. ONE CENSUS IT'S GOING TO RECORD SIX ENGINE RIGHT INTO SEPARATELY. TO FILL THE DATA GAP THAT AFFECTS LGBT Q. INDIVIDUALS DISPROPORTIONATELY. SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT REMEDY IF ANY DO YOU PROPOSE TO ENSURE THE- INTEGRITY OF GOVERNMENT DATA. WHICH IS A VITAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR ADVOCATES. CONCERNED. FOR THE SAFETY FEW AND MOST LIKE MANY OF YOU ON THIS. HI MY NAME IS COBY LANDS ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS AND SURVIVING PUNISHED THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS TODAY I'VE ALSO DEALT SO MUCH RESPECT TO THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE INCARCERATION ARE STILL HERE SPEAKING ABOUT AN ADVOCATING FOR CHANGE I HAVEN'T DIRECTLY BUT I'VE BEEN DOZEN PEOPLE PRISONS FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AND HAVE EXPERIENCE SECONDHAND SO MUCH OF THE TRAUMA OF USE THAT OCCURS IN THERE AND ALSO WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE TO PRISON AND WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME FIGHTING TO. TO SUPPORT WILL TO SURVIVE THEIR TIME DURING TERRIBLE CONDITIONS BUT ALSO TO ACHIEVE RELEASE AND SO SOME OF THAT IS THROUGH SOME THE RE SENTENCING MECHANISMS THAT THAT SOME FROM THE DA'S OFFICE MENTIONED SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY IN THIS MOMENT SINCE BOTH OF YOU HERE AND ESPECIALLY YOUR HERE IN THAT UNIT WE COULD REALLY USE MORE LEADERSHIP FROM THE DA'S OFFICE AROUND ELEVEN SEVENTY D. READ AND SING POSSIBILITIES. AND THERE IS THERE WAS A BILL PASSED RATE AB TWO NINE FORTY TWO WHICH GIVES THE IS ACTUAL AUTHORITY TO INITIATE RESENTING FOR PEOPLE POST CONVICTION AND IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE PERSON WE KNOW OF SO FAR STATEWIDE WHO'S ACTUALLY BEEN REASONS THROUGH THAT POWER THAT YOU ALL NOW SO JUST HERE TO SAY WE REALLY WANTS. LEADERSHIP THERE WE CAN SUPPORT IT WERE THERE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WE ALL WORK WITH MANY OF US IN THE ROOM WHO WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SUPPORT YOU TO TAKE LEADERSHIP TO MACHINE WE SENTENCING AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT THE TWO RECENT PROSECUTIONS THAT A WITNESS IN LA ON ONE FOR A WOMAN WHO DEFENDED HERSELF IN AN ABUSIVE SITUATION THE PROSPECTORS IN COMPTON AS WE SEE EVERYWHERE WE'RE INTENT ON MAKING SURE THAT SHE SPENT THE REST OF HER LIFE IN PRISON FOR TO SOFTEN A TERRIBLE SITUATION SO THE FORMS ARE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAVE BEEN. HAVE HAD ALMOST NO IMPACT IN A POSITIVE WAY THAT WE'VE SEEN AS A GROUP THAT DEFENDS SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE WERE BEING PROSECUTED AND CRIMINALIZED SO WE IT. THERE'S A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND THEN ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN WHO. SHE WAS IN QUESTION IS A YOUNG PERSON'S BUT MOST WERE TIMES SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. SHOULD THIS IS WHAT SHE NEEDED AND IT WAS REFUSE SO EVEN WHEN THOSE RESOURCES EXIST. AND EVEN WHEN WE ARE THERE IN COURT FIGHTING RIGHT TO SAY YOU DIDN'T LIKE. THIS SELF DEFENSE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE NOT A CRIME RIGHT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK WOMEN IN PARTICULAR. ON IT THAT IS NOT THE CASE. SO THERE'S SO MANY THINGS WE CAN DO TO INTERRUPT SOME OF THE SENTENCING PROCESS SEES. ANOTHER MAIN ONE IS AROUND ACCOMPLICES WOMEN IN PARTICULAR CHARGED AS ACCOMPLICES. FELONY MURDER ONLY TOUCHED. ON THAT PROBLEM RIGHT THE FELONY MURDER REFORM FOR ACCOMPLICES THAT WE WORKED ON. SO JUST AS A PLEASE USE THIS IS A RESOURCE WE HAVE A GAZILLION IDEAS. THAT ARE INFORMED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN FORMING FRUSTRATED. I'M WE WOULD LOVE TO HELP THINK. BEFORE YOU LEAVE. WITH RESPECT TO THE ELEVEN SEVENTY THESE YEAH SO. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT OUR OFFICE DOES IT. DOESN'T KNOW WHICH CASES TO FOCUS ON SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING YOUR HAVE TO ORGANIZE TO BRING THOSE CASES TO OUR ATTENTION WE WOULD LOVE TO. IT WILL MAKE SURE TO THREE. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT TOMORROW AT MY DISTRICT OFFICE FROM NINE TO ONE ARE LEGISLATIVE TEAM WILL BE THERE HEARING DISTRICT BILL IDEA SO IF YOU HAVE IDEAS IDEAS FOR NEW LEGISLATION COME ON DOWN FROM NINE TO ONE SO YOU CAN TALK WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE STAFF THAT'S DOWN HERE FROM THE CAPITOL OFFICE. YEAH I THINK SO MUCH FOR THAT AND FOR IN THIS TOGETHER IN THE DIALOGUE THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING HERE AND OTHER WOMEN WARRIORS THAT HERE LIKE THIS VERY POWERFUL. MY NAME IS JOHN MATTHEWS I WORK FOR THE JUSTICE COLLABORATIVE WORKING A COUPLE JUST REFORM AROUND THE COUNTRY AND REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN CREATE A MORE HUMANE. JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS ALSO FEDERAL PROSECUTOR BEFORE AND SO MY QUESTION IS HAS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE CULTURE AND I YOUR SEX SHOULD YOU KNOW WASN'T CONSIDERED POPULAR FIRST QUESTION IS LIKE HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT. CULTURE RIGHT MAKE IT YOU KNOW I FOUND THAT. SIX THAT'S WITH THE FINE BY CONVICTION RATES AND- THE SEXIEST CASES WERE THE ONES THAT WERE YOU KNOW LIKE. THE RESIGNATIONS AND GOING TO TRIAL AND HAPPINESS SO LIKE. HOW COULD CHANGE THAT CULTURE. SO THAT THERE'S MORE UNITS DOING THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT YOU INTERESTED IN THAT WORK. I'M AND ALSO TO YOUR POINT ABOUT PROBATION. AND I HEARD IT SOUND LIKE THE MOST THAT WAS PRE PLEA OR START CLOSELY. AND SOMEONE AND WHAT EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE. TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW PREVIOUSLY AND. IN YES THE PROBATION ID LIKE AT HOW WE HOW WE THINK ABOUT SHRINKING THE SYSTEM BECAUSE EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO RESOURCES. AND IT'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE RESOURCES ARE GOING RALLY I LIKE THE IDEA. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKING WITH MANY ORGANIZATIONS RALLY HOW CAN WE DIVERT. MORE MONEY TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE SYSTEM SO. THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD TO BE HERE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW YOU GUYS THOUGHT ENOUGH OF ME TO INVITE ME AND MY OFFICE THOUGHT ENOUGH OF ME TO SEND ME. SO I THINK IT'S JUST PUBLICITY AND OTHER THING TOO IS I REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT MY OFFICE THINGS ABOUT ME. I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT ME I SO THE RECORD EVERY DAY AND TRY TO DO MY BEST JOB THAT I POSSIBLY CAN. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A DA THAT SUPPORTS TREATMENT. JACKIE LACEY WA HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF TREATMENT SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN I FIRST CAME DOWNTOWN THERE IS A SUPERVISOR WHO CAME TO ME AND SAID YOU KNOW IT'S TOO BAD YOU CAME DOWNTOWN TO DO THE TREATMENT COURT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO CLOSE SOON. AND I WAS LIKE OH OKAY WHATEVER. AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNEW THERE WAS. MONEY AND THERE WAS AN EXPANSION OF THE TREATMENT COURTS. AND SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT HIGHER UP IN OUR OFFICE SUPPORT THE TREATMENT COURTS AND GIVE GIVE US RESPECT AND THEN. THROUGH THAT JACKIE LACEY FORMED A NEW UNIT IT'S CALLED THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVISION. AT MY HEAD DEPUTY. DAY GOES OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND WE DO MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. SO YOU APPLY FOR MENTAL HEALTH VERSION OF YOUR DEFENDANT. AND THEN THAT UNIT REVIEWS IT AND DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT THE DA'S POSITION IS APPROPRIATE OR NOT APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW BECAUSE SOME DA'S MIGHT DIFFER. AND I THINK A LOT OF IT TOO IS. PERSONALITY DRIVEN ABOUT THE JUDGE WHO MADE THAT DECISION NOT TO SEND SOMEONE TO TREATMENT. YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A CULTURE AND THE JUDGE THERE YOU ARE. THERE'S A CULTURE IN THE YOU KNOW. IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WHETHER OR NOT TREATMENT IS JUST A- AN EASY WAY OUT. YOU KNOW IT I KNOW IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN IT IT'S HARD BUT YOU SAID FIVE YEARS PROBATION. IT'S HARD. I MEAN IT'S A LONG TIME TO BE ON PROBATION IT BE EASIER FOR YOU TO JUST TAKE YOUR JAIL TIME AND GO ON I MEAN. WHEN PEOPLE COME TO TREATMENT I HOPE. THAT THEY ARE EDUCATED ON WHAT THEY'RE GETTING THEIR SINCE THEMSELVES INTO. NO EYES WIDE OPEN AND IT IS HARD OF IT IS SO HARD. BUT MAYBE IN THE LONG RUN IT'S BETTER FOR THEM I'M NOT SURE SOMETIMES I LIVE WITH THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE. GET INTO TREATMENT AND THEN DE I KNOW I HAVE MY OWN GUILT. ABOUT THAT TO WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAD SOMETHING TO PRISON WITH BABY ALIVE HOW WOULD THEIR FAMILY FEEL. NO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE THAT I HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE NOW. AND I HAVE MORE THAN ONE SO IT'S TRAUMATIZING SO ANYWAY. MY OWN TRAUMA. US AIR CONDITIONER ON AN ADVOCATE WITH CALIFORNIA COOL TEMPERAMENT PRISONER AND I'M OF THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FREEDOM CENTER AND- ONE OF THINGS ON MY PLATE TO CONTINUE TO INSPIRE ME WITH THEIR- COURAGE AND POWER IN THE LEADERSHIP THERE PROVIDING THAT ONLY REALLY THEY CAN PROVIDE SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HERE THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF ANALYSTS ON THE FIRST PANEL. THE CZECHO ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW TRAUMATIZING THE SYSTEM IS AND HOW MUCH IT PUNISHES PEOPLE FOR HISTORIES OF TRAUMA AND I AM. I MEAN. SO HOW DO WE. AND ALSO HOW MANY PEOPLE ON THAT PANEL TALKED ABOUT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR HISTORY OF TRAUMA OR TALK ABOUT SELF DEFENSE THAT THAT'S USED AGAINST THEM. IN AN IN SENTENCING AND REFUSING PAROLE BECAUSE IT'S SEEN AS A REFUSAL TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO. YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THE MANY OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO AND THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO CONTINUE TO TRAUMATIZE PEOPLE HOW. HOW ARE WE. WHAT IS THE FIGHT SO THAT TRAUMA CAN BE CONSIDERED. AND NOT SEEN AS A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND- HAD A SECOND FORCED AND HOW DO YOU. WHAT'S THE LEGISLATION. THAT PUTS MONEY REAL REALLY TAKES MONEY OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PUTS IT INTO. ADDRESSING SOME OF THAT HISTORY'S SO LIKE WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS. TO STOP THAT. AND TO EDUCATE OR HOLD JUDGES. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. AROUND TRAUMA AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE UNDER THE POWER OF SOMEONE WHO ABUSES HE IS SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE MECHANISMS THAT WE CAN CREATE THROUGH LEGISLATION. HI MY NAME IS INGRID. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ALTERNATE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILL WERE THINKING IN TERMS OF SENTENCING IN THE CASES THAT WE TRY ARE YOU AWARE THAT THERE ARE FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES TO A FELONY CONVICTION BEFORE PERSON PLEASE GUILTY. AND IF YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS ARE YOU A ARE YOU LETTING YOUR CLIENTS AND ALL THAT. THEY WILL THEY WILL FACE THESE CONSEQUENCES ONCE THEY TAKE UP THIS FELONY CONVICTION AND THEY'RE RELEASED. AND THAT I WILL BE LOCKED OUT OF ALL OF THESE ALL OF THESE SERVICES WHEN THEY COME HOME. SEE WHEN YOU SAY CLIENT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE MISCHIEVOUS I'M TOM I'M SPEAKING IN TERMS OF SENTENCING AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING IN TERMS OF CLIENTS. DOESN'T MATTER. I WANT YOU TO GO FIRST AND THEN I THINK WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT FIVE OR SEVEN MORE MINUTES BEFORE WILL HAVE TO OFFICIALLY END SO THAT. BET YOU THAT CAN PREPARE FOR THEIR SEVEN O'CLOCK EVEN. YES I. TO THE BUTTON I ACTUALLY HELPED WRITE THE BOOK ON JUVENILE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES JUNE WOULD YOU TO PATIENT I'VE TRAINED LAWYERS AND JUDGES AND EVERYWHERE EVERYBODY I COULD ABOUT THAT AND SO BAILABLE ON A ON A WEBSITE CALLED PJ DC DOT ORG AND THERE'S NO WAY I COULD POSSIBLY INFORMED THE CLIENTS OF EVERY POSSIBLE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY IN YOUR SO RIGHT BUT WE DO TRY TO HIT THE MAJOR ONES. AND WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO MINIMIZE AND REDUCE THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES WORKING ON LEGISLATION ON OUT SO IT IT'S JUST TERRIFIC PROGRAM I'M IN A PROBLEM IN KIDS WHO A PLATE TO CERTAIN MISDEMEANOR BATTERY OFFENSES CAN NOT POSSESS A WEAPON UNTIL THE AGE OF THIRTY AND THAT CAN PREVENT THEM FROM ENTERING INTO THE MILITARY YOU KNOW SO THAT'S THAT'S JUST ONE OF HUNDREDS OF CONSEQUENCES GET THE CONSIDER. OKAY KID DID YOU HEAR ME. OK. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR POINT. WE E. UNDER BY LAW WOULD HAVE TO INFORM ANYBODY WHO IS ENTERING INTO A PLEASE WE HAVE TO INFORM THEM OF THE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES BEFORE BEFORE JUDGE WILL ACTUALLY TAKE A PLEA I THINK KIM ALL TELL YOU THAT. ON OUR SIDE WE'RE GETTING MORE EDUCATED ABOUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES. BUT TO BE FRANK WITH YOU WHEN WE'RE TRAINED AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE DA'S OFFICE THERE TRYING CASES AND SO. THEIR FOCUS IS A IN IS AN ON COLLATERAL CONDITION ARE CONSEQUENCES AND SO THERE HAS TO BE AS KIM POINTED OUT A CULTURE CHANGE WHERE THE WHOLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IF YOU PLEAD GUILTY TO A CERTAIN OFFENSE. YOU CAN'T BECOME A TEACHER HE PLEAD GUILTY A CERTAIN THE OFFENSE YOU CAN'T BE A THE BUS DRIVER IF YOU PLEAD GUILTY TO A CERTAIN EVENTS YOU CAN'T BE A FISHING LICENSE SECURITY GUARD SEE THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME I. DON'T KNOW AND SO IT IT'S A GOOD THING THAT YOU'RE BRING IT UP IT'S GOOD THING THAT'S BEING BROUGHT UP IN THIS HEARING BECAUSE I THINK. NOT ONLY CAN IT BE ADDRESSED FROM THE LEGISLATURE VIEW I THINK IT HAS TO BE TALKED ABOUT BROADLY WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT'S HAPPENING NOT AS FAST AS MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT BUT I THINK IT IS HAPPENING. SO I CAN OFFER A SOLUTION I CAN COME DOWN TO YOUR OFFICE AND TRAIN YOUR WHOLE STAFF ON THE FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED COLLADO CONSEQUENCES TO A FELONY CONVICTION SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS AND THEY CAN FIGHT HARDER FOR THEIR CASES AND THEY WON'T BE. ENOUGH FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR CHILDREN PLACED IN DCFS SYSTEM. INGRID I INVITE YOU TO COME TO MY. OFFICE TO OKAY I ONLY HANDLE JUVENILE BUT I. YEAH I JUST HAVE A STATEMENT YEAH I'M APRIL. AND SO. THE THING THAT I REALLY WANT TO CHALLENGE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM TODAY I APPRECIATE HOW PROGRESSIVE YOU GUYS ARE. BUT THE LANGUAGE THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING HERE'S BEEN OFFENDER AN INMATE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE LABELS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE PLACED ON THAT'S REPLACE BACK IN SLAVERY DAYS LATE. ABOLISHED SLAVERY AND SO THEY THEN STARTED LABELING THAT'S A CRIMINALIZING US BECAUSE THEY NEEDED US TO HAVE THE THEY HAVE FREE LABOR. AND SO I REALLY WANT TO CHALLENGE EVERYBODY TODAY AND THEY THINK ABOUT. WHEN THEY DO TALK ABOUT ONE INCARCERATED PEOPLE INCARCERATED PEOPLE HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT THEM ARE THE INMATES. ARE THE OFFENDERS NO. ONE THE CARD FOR THE PEOPLE THERE ACROSS WHERE PEOPLE THEIR PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING. DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE SYSTEM SINCE ARE JUST REALLY WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU. WHEN YOU ADDRESS THESE PEOPLE AND HOW YOU DECIDE TO DISCUSS THIS CAN YOU PLEASE NOT CALL LIST INMATES AND OFFENDERS BECAUSE A VERY DEGRADING. AND YOU'RE PLACING LABELS ON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU APRIL SO WITH THAT. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU ALL FOR SHOWING UP ON THIS. THURSDAY OR WEDNESDAY WEDNESDAY. TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PERVASIVE HOW PERVASIVE THE INCARCERATION IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS IN SO MANY OF OUR LIVES THERE IS A REASON WHY IN NEW YORK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CLOSING DOWN RYKER'S ISLAND NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE INCARCERATED FOLKS BUT BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE MEDICAL DOCTORS TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED TO THE VISITORS HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED. TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS NO LONGER A VIABLE OPTION AND SO THESE SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS PUTTING WOMEN IN THE SPOTLIGHT. OUR ABOUT ASKING US HOW WE WANT TO LIVE I WENT WITH THE DELEGATION TO NORWAY TO LOOK AT THEIR STATE PRISONS THAT WAS TRAUMATIZING TO SEE HOW DIFFERENTLY THEY TREAT THEIR OWN AND THEY SAY. THE COURT IS WHERE YOU PUNISH. THE PRISON IS WHERE YOU REHABILITATE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BECOME BETTER NEIGHBORS. IT IS NOT PUNITIVE IT IS NOT DE HUMOR TIME DE HUMANIZING. IT IS NOT DEMORALIZING. IT IS ABOUT HEALING PEOPLE SO THEY CAN COME OUT WHOLE SO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN OUR LOVING RELATIONSHIP TO BE IN A JOB WHERE THERE'S DIGNITY TO WALK DOWN THE STREET AND FEEL WHOLE. AND WE TAKE APART HUMANITY PIECE BY PIECE WITH EVERY STEP IN THIS SYSTEM FROM HOW WE OVER MONITOR FOLKS THAT AND HOW WE OVER CHARGE THEM TO THEN HOW WE OVER SENTENCE THEM TO THEN HOW WE RE INCARCERATE AND THEN HOW WE DENY ACCESS TO REHABILITATION THAT PIPELINE HAS SO MANY TENTACLES. THAT DESTROYED FAMILIES AND HOPE AND SO I AM CONTINUING TO INVITE ALL OF US TO BE PART OF THIS BECAUSE IF WE'RE HERE WE'RE PART OF THE SOLUTION YOU'RE NOT CALL TO THE PANEL YOU DID NOT SIT IN THE SEATS. BECAUSE WE THINK YOUR PROBLEM. YOU HAVE A SKILL SET OR A TRAUMA OR A STORY. THAT WILL HELP SOLVE THIS. AND IT TAKES US ALL TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE TRUTHS OF THIS SYSTEM IF WE WANT TO SEE A DIFFERENT FUTURE SO I THINK YOU I WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL HERE AS I SAID FOR YOUR COURAGE AND FOR GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH YOUR OWN TRAUMAS. IN THE SYSTEM. AND I WANT TO THANK THE FIRST PANEL FOR YOUR COURAGE FOR YOUR WISDOM FOR YOUR INSIGHT FOR YOUR STRENGTH FOR YOUR HEART FOR YOUR PERSEVERANCE. AND FOR YOUR WORDS AND I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO JOINED US TO LIVE STREAM AND THOSE AT THAT SHIVA. FOR OPENING UP YOUR HERE YEARS IN YOUR HEARTS TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU WHEN WE WILL SEE YOU IN FEBRUARY
