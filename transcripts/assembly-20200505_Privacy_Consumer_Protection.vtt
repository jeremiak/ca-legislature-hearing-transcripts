THIS SO WE STARTED SPORTING

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.594
WAYS IN WHICH THE RESTAURANTS

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.329
COULD HAVE MORE POWER TO

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:52.230
COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR OWN

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:54.699
CLIENTS AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY

ARE ONLY LISTED ON THESE

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:56.868
PLATFORMS IF THEY HAVE AN

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:59.270
AGREEMENT. WE STARTED OFF WITH

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.538
A KIND OF SHARING OF

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:02.707
INFORMATION BILL NOW WE

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.275
UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WOULD RUN

00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:05.410
INTO SOME PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY

00:34:05.476 --> 00:34:07.211
THIS COMMITTEE BUT PROBLEMS

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:08.179

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:14.886
AGREED TO PULL THAT PIECE BACK

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:16.254
AND STILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.822
WORK ON. WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.791
LIKE CAN CUSTOMERS HAVE THE

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:22.393
POWER TO SAY YES THE RESTAURANT

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.462
CAN HAVE MY INFORMATION. OR CAN

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.330
THEY OPT OUT OF THAT. BUT

00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:27.465
BECAUSE OF OUR SHORTENED

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:28.966
SCHEDULE IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME

00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:30.368
WE COULD WORK ON THIS BILL THAT

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:31.302
PIECE WE'VE TAKEN COMPLETELY

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:32.603
OUT AND NOW WE JUST HAVE THE

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.871
REQUIREMENTTHAT THERE BE A

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:35.840
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP. AND

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:38.342
ALL THIS SAYS IS BASICALLY THAT

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.845
FOR A DELIVERY PLATFORM TO PUT

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:43.080
UP THE MANUAL TO PUT THE LOGO

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:44.048
TO ACT LIKE THERE IS A

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:55.092
WILL PREVENT THE RESTAURANTS

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.295
WHO DON'T WANT TO BE LISTED

00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:59.497

CHAIRMAN OF THIS IS A- AN

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:40.284
INTERESTING BILL OBVIOUSLY KIND

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.585
OF A NEW SITUATION WITH A DATE

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:42.686
AMICK BETWEEN FOOD DELIVERY

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.655
PLATFORMS AND RESTAURANTS. BUT

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:46.623
NOT A NEW ISSUE AT ALL I MEAN

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.625
WE HAVE A- HUNDRED YEARS OF

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:51.628
CASE LAW WHERE- MANUFACTURES OR

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:53.063
WHOLESALERS HAVE YOU KNOW WHICH

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.264
IS THE RATE OF THE RESTAURANT

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.799
IN THIS CASE HAVE DISPUTES WITH

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:58.635
DISTRIBUTORS OF PRODUCTS. AND

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:01.305
THE- FEDERAL LAW HAS HAS PRETTY

00:49:01.371 --> 00:49:03.106
NARROWLY CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:05.342
OF A MANUFACTURER WHOLESALER TO

00:49:05.409 --> 00:49:08.979
PUT. RESTRICTIONS ON THE- THE

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:10.947
USE OF THEIR PRODUCTS BY PEOPLE

00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:12.916
FURTHER DOWN THE VALUE CHAIN SO

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.184
I'D I'D START OUT WITH A LITTLE

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:16.053
BIT OF SKEPTICISM. I THINK THE

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:18.388
PRIVACY. IMPLICATIONS OF THE

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.756
BILL ARE VERY INTERESTING AND I

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:20.557
HAD TWO QUESTIONS RELATED

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:21.958
QUESTIONS LASSEN BOTH THE SAME

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:23.427
TIME AND BE INTERESTED TO HEAR

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:25.228
YOUR RESPONSE SO THE FIRST OF

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:27.964
THEM IS THAT- THE BILL AS

00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:29.199
AMENDED. WE PROHIBITS A FOOD

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.934
DELIVERY PLATFORM FROM USING

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:32.302
THE MENU OR THE LOCAL

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:33.270
RESTAURANT WITHOUT THEIR

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:34.871
PERMISSION. SO KIND OF TWO

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:36.573
DIFFERENT ISSUES IN MY OPINION

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.742
SO THE MENU- IS AN INTERESTING

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.110
CASE BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:42.179
THAT'S ALREADY BEING. PUT OUT

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:43.513
FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION BY THE

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.382
RESTAURANT ITSELF SO IT'S

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:46.383
ALREADY IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:47.451
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:49:47.517 --> 00:49:48.552
PRIVATE INFORMATION OF THE

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:51.455
RESTAURANT- SO MY QUESTION IS

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:52.356
HOW IS THAT NOT FAIR USE

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:54.558
BECAUSE MIDDLE OF LARGE BODY OF

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:55.826
CASE LAW THAT SAYS THAT THAT.

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:57.427
THE GENERALLY THAT'S FAIR USE

00:49:57.494 --> 00:49:59.329
WITH CAN YOU YOUR PUTTING YOU

00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:00.163
REDISTRIBUTE SOMETHING THAT

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.465
ALREADY HAS BEEN PUT OUT IN THE

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:02.833
PUBLIC DOMAIN BY SOMEONE. AND

00:50:02.899 --> 00:50:04.501
THEN RELATED QUESTION ON THE

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:06.636
LOGO. LOGO IS KIND OF A

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:07.237
DIFFERENT ISSUE THAT'S THAT'S

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.372
UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW WHICH IS

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.640
FEDERAL LAW SO- YOU KNOW

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:12.142
FEDERAL COPYRIGHT LAWS GOVERNS

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:13.243
THE USE OF THAT LOOK AT WHETHER

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:13.910
OR NOT IT'S FAIR USE NOT

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:16.546
WONDERING HOW. THAT FEDERAL

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:19.015
LAWS NOT PREEMPTIVE OF ANY KIND

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:21.251
OF A TEMPLATE THAT WE MAKE HERE

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:22.586
AT THE STATE LEVEL TO. RESTRICT

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:25.288
THE USE OF THE LOOK THOSE LONG.

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:26.923
SO THE FOR. FIRST OF ALL I

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.724
THINK THE WAY THAT YOU'RE

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:31.595
THINKING OF IT MOM IS- LIKE THE

00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:33.463
MANUFACTURE TO THE DELIVERY YES

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:34.731
THIS I KIND OF A UNIQUE

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:35.932
SITUATION THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:38.168
ABOUT PREPARED HOT FOOD SO

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:39.069
COULD BE THOUGHT IN A

00:50:39.136 --> 00:50:40.203
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY WHAT'S

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.105
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:43.673
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DELIVERY

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.175
DRIVER IN THE RESTAURANT IS A

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:46.943
DELIVERY COMPANY IS ACTUALLY

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.812
PURCHASING FOOD AND RESELLING

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:51.548
IT TO THE CUSTOMER. THAT I

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:53.316
THINK EVEN IN EXISTING LAW

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:55.085
COULD CREATE OTHER ISSUES WHEN

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.186
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SURVIVAL

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:58.455
FOOD- AND SO WE'RE NOT TALKING

00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:01.224
ABOUT A WIDGET OR OR AN ITEM

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:02.793
RIGHT IN THE SALE OF IT WE'RE

00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:04.261
TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:06.596
PREPARED FOOD- AS FAR AS THE

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:08.632
MENU GOES THE PROBLEM WITH

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:11.234
HAVING AN INTERMEDIARY- SUCH AS

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:13.370
THE DELIVERY BERNIE. OUT AN

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:14.504
AGREEMENT IS WHEN THE

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.072
RESTAURANT NO LONGER USES THAT

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:18.442
MANUAL- THERE'S NO WAY FOR THE

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:19.709
RESTAURANT TO TELL THE CUSTOMER

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:21.411
THAT BECAUSE THE CUSTOMERS NOT

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:23.280
DIRECTLY CONTACTING THE

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:24.481
RESTAURANT IN THE RESTAURANT IS

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:27.918
NOT SOMETIMES EVEN KNOWING THAT

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:29.586
EIGHT DELIVERY COMPANY IS OUT

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:32.756
THERE- DEAN OLD BANYA. AS SO

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:35.192
CUSTOMER I SEE THIS HAVE NO

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:37.360
IDEA THAT THIS RESTAURANT HAS

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.830
NO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:42.632
DELIVERY COMPANY BECAUSE ARE

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:43.366
YOU THERE YET GO FOR INSTANCE

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:47.070
IN THERE IS A- SHIP BETWEEN THE

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:49.039
TWO COMPANIES I MAY. HE WRAP

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:51.808
ALL. AND IN BECAUSE SOME OF

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.310
RESTAURANTS BUSINESS IS ALSO

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:55.979
DRIVEN BY THINGS LIKE YELP AND

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:58.482
THAT YOU KNOW CRITICISM I'M A

00:51:58.548 --> 00:51:59.883
CUSTOMER I ORDER SOMETHING THAT

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.485
I ASSUME IS ON THE MENU BECAUSE

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:03.086
THAT'S A MAN YOU THAT HAS BEEN

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:04.721
GIVEN TO ME IT'S NOT I'M NOT

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.289
TOLD THAT WHEN I ORDER IT IN

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:08.124
FACT I'M NOT TOLD THAT TOOK

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.159
THREE HOURS LATER WHEN MY

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.094
DELIVERY DOESN'T COM AND THEN I

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:13.730
GO ON AND EIGHT NEGATIVE

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:16.566
COMMENT ON YELP AFFECTS THAT

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:18.768
BUSINESSES. BUSINESS EVEN

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.136
THOUGH THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO

00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:22.005
WITH THIS ENTIRE DISSEMINATION

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:23.373
THIS IS HAPPENING OVER AND OVER

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.941
AGAIN SO I THINK WE'RE ENTERING

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:28.245
INTO INTO A NEW. TYPE OF- FAIR

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:29.913
BUSINESS PRACTICE GOING ON AND

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.449
SO I THINK TO LOOK AT IT AND

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:33.517
KIND OF THAT NARAL OLD

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.785
MANUFACTURE VERSES SELLER IT IS

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:38.722
A LITTLE LIMITED- AND THAT'S-

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.323
THE I THINK THE MAIN CREST. I

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.292
WOULD GO THE CALIFORNIA

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:44.227
RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SAYS THE

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:45.562
COPYRIGHT LAWS AREN'T WORKING.

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:47.497
AND SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:49.533
WOULD BE- FEDERALLY PREEMPTED

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:50.734
BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.302
WORKING FOR THESE RESTAURANTS.

00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:54.938
THANK YOU ARE SO THE IT IS TRUE

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:55.805

INTERESTING A NEW SITUATION BUT

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:58.475
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE

00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:00.076
UNIQUE ELEMENTS. THAT ARE

00:53:00.143 --> 00:53:02.913
BROUGHT. BY THE FACT THAT THIS

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:04.781
IS WHAT THE PROVISION OF FOOD I

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:05.849

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.350
HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS ME

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:08.018

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:27.964
EXISTING LAW FOR A RESTAURANT

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:29.866

QUESTIONS AS WELL- REALLY WHAT

00:55:05.368 --> 00:55:07.537
WHAT THE ISSUE IS IT HERE AND

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:08.905
CERTAINLY NO MENUS TO THE

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:10.273
PREVIOUS QUESTION MENUS. ARE

OUT IN PUBLIC- ADMITS GONZALEZ

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:15.078
STATED. THE USE OF THESE

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.147
MATERIALS WITHOUT CONSENT TO

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:17.781
JEFF THAT THERE'S A

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.282
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:20.984
RESTAURANTS AND THE- THIRD

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:22.952
PARTY ENTITIES WHICH IN MANY OF

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:24.921
THESE CASES IS NOT ACCURATE.

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:25.922
AND IT MATTERS FOR A NUMBER OF

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.058
REASONS ONE OF THE REASONS IS

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:29.893
WE'RE SERVING PREPARED FOOD. WE

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:32.128
ARE REGULATED RIGHTFULLY SO BY

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:33.630
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ABOUT

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:36.499
THE CONDITION THAT SUIT. IN

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:38.601
THESE CASES WE HAVE NO IDEA OF

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:39.736
THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF THE

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:42.372
FOOD AND SO IT BECOMES VERY

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:47.944
IMPORTANT ISSUE. COMMUNITY ALSO.

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:49.512
AT THE RELATED TO PAIR. FOOD

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:51.214
AND OUR NEED. TO KNOW AND WHO

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:53.116
IS THIS IT. WITHOUT CONSENT OF

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:54.217
OUR PRODUCTS ON THE WEB. WE

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:56.453
DON'T KNOW THAT. MR KILEY IT

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.922
TENDS TO BE A LARGER ISSUE WITH

00:55:58.988 --> 00:55:59.789
THE SMALLER INDEPENDENT

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.458
RESTAURANT AND WE HAVE HEARD

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:03.493
REPEATEDLY FOR YEARS. WITH AN

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.628
UPTICK IN COMPLAINT LATELY THAT

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.964
THEY DO TRY TO SOLVE THIS ONE

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:09.699
ON ONE WITH THIRD PARTY ENTITY.

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:11.668
THIRD PARTY ENTITY USUALLY

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:13.403
RESPONSE WITH SOME SORT OF IT'S

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.171
A CLERICAL ERROR WILL FIX IT

00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:16.206
AND THAT THAT THE GENERALLY

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:17.674
HAPPENS IN SO THE SMALLER

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:19.042
RESTAURANTS THAT DON'T HAVE THE

00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:21.411
LEVERAGE. OF THE LARGER CHAIN

00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:23.246
RESTAURANTS. HAVE LET THE BILL

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:25.181
OF THE SORT OF. YOU KNOW MUSCLE

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:27.383
THEIR WAY THROUGH. AND SO IT

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:29.085
ENDS UP BEING. THE CREW BUT THE

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:31.287
SMALLER INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.256
HAVE JUMPED THROUGH. OP NOTE

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:35.391
THAT. DAMAGE TO THEIR BRAND.

00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:38.995
AND QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES WITH

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:39.596
THEIR FOOD. I GUESS THE FLIP

00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:44.100
SIDE OF THAT MIGHT. IT WOULD

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:47.570
BE. MORE LIKELY TO- AGREED TO

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:50.206
HAVE THEIR- INFORMATION ON

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:51.741
ESTABLISHED PLATFORM SO THAT

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:53.476
COULD LEAD TO HIGHER BARRIERS

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:56.012
TO ENTRY IN THE DELIVERY MARKET

00:56:56.079 --> 00:57:00.350
DO YOU SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM.

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:02.452
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MISTER

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:02.919
KELLY I'M NOT TOTALLY

00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:04.854
UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION.

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:06.322
WELL I MEAN IF THIS PASSES AND

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:07.390
YOU HAVE TO GET EXPRESS

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:08.691
PERMISSION THEN IT SEEMS LIKELY

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:09.893
THAT RESTAURANTS WILL BE MORE

00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:10.927
LIKELY TO GRANTED TECH

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:11.995
COMPANIES WE'VE ALL HEARD OF

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:13.897
LIKE A GROUNDHOG OR WHAT HAVE

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:15.765
YOU- SO THAT COULD BE A BARRIER

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.167
TO ENTRY FOR LESS ESTABLISH

00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:18.935
DELIVERY COMPANIES WHO AREN'T

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:21.104
ABLE TO. I HAVE A WIDER

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:23.907
SELECTION AVAILABLE. I WOULD

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:25.575
ARGUE JUST THE OPPOSITE

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:27.644
ACTUALLY I'M SORRY- I WOULD ASK

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:28.511
YOU TO IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:29.913
THIS WILL. ACTUALLY ALLOW THE

00:57:29.979 --> 00:57:31.648
MARKET TO WORK ACCORDINGLY

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:33.917
BECAUSE- THE BIG CARRIERS ARE

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:37.153
TAKING A LARGE PERCENTAGE. OF

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.421
THE OVERALL BILL FROM THESE

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:40.690
RESTAURANTS WHERE A SMALLER NEW

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:42.091
START UP COMPANY COULD COME IN

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:43.560
AND OFFER FAR LASSEN BECAUSE

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:44.561
IT'S A WRITTEN CONTRACT AND

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:45.995
THAT'S WELL ESTABLISHED BEFORE

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.497
HAND. IT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:51.100
FOR THE MARKET TO WORK. SO THAT

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.202
THAT'S IN CASES WHERE THERE

00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:53.403
ACTUALLY AGREEING TO PAY THE

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:54.838
RESTAURANT RIGHT SO THERE IS BY

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:55.972
DEFINITION RT PERMISSIONS FROM

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:57.774
GRANT. WELL THAT THAT WHAT

00:57:57.841 --> 00:57:59.642
HAPPENS IS RESTAURANTS GET PUT

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:00.910
IN POSITION SPECIALLY SMALL

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:02.312
RESTAURANTS OF STARTING OUT BE

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:03.880
LISTED WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:05.081
AND THEN THEIR CUSTOMERS BEING

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.650
RELIANT ON THESE- DELIVERY

00:58:07.717 --> 00:58:10.286
PLATFORMS WITH EIGHTY AT IT AND

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:10.954
THEN THE DELIVERY PLATFORM

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.589
COMES TO THE RESTAURANT. IN

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.724
ALMOST NOT COURSE THE FASHION-

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:17.227
REQUIRES THE RESTAURANT TO BUY

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:20.029
IN. TO THEIR PERCENTAGE BEING

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.364
TAKEN OR TO TAKE THEIR

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:22.799
CUSTOMERS ELSEWHERE THIS IS

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:25.301
WHERE- UNFORTUNATELY KIND OF

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:27.103
THIS BIG BUSINESS HAS IT HAS

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:28.504
CORRUPTED ON THE ABILITY OF

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.939
SMALL RESTAURANTS TO HAVE THE

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:33.176
DECISION. SO IT STARTS OFF AS-

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:35.245
AT WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:36.746
THEN THE- COMPANY I DON'T WANNA

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:37.981
NAY MANY OF THEM COME IN. AND

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:39.749
SAY YOU NEEDS NOW AGREE TO THIS

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:41.885
PERCENTAGE TO SIGNING UP FOR US

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:43.586
AND THIS IS A PERCENTAGE WE'RE

00:58:43.653 --> 00:58:45.188
GOING TO TAKE. WE LEVEL THE

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:46.756
PLAYING FIELD BY SAYING THAT'S

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:47.757
UP FRONT IN THE BEGINNING DO

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:49.425
YOU WANT TO SIGN ON IT NOT IT

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:50.793
ALSO ALLOWS SMALL START UP

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.662
COMPANIES TO SAY WE'RE OFFERING

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:53.563
LESS IT ALSO ALLOWS THE

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.098
RESTAURANT TO MAKE AN EDUCATED

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:56.132
DECISION ABOUT WHETHER IT'S

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.635
CHEAPER. OR MAKES MORE SENSE

00:58:58.701 --> 00:58:59.569
FOR THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES TO BE

00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:01.704
DELIVERING- THAT FOOD AT SOME

00:59:01.771 --> 00:59:03.139
RESTAURANT STILL STILL HAVE

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.675
BEEN IN THIS- AT PANDEMIC

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:07.010
ENVIRONMENT WHERE. A LOT OF

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.177
RESTAURANTS HAVE CHOSEN TO DO

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.346
THAT GOES INTO NOT. TO SIMPLY

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:11.814
ALLOW TAKE OUT RATHER THAN

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.850
DELIVERY AS A AS A WAY TO-

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:16.052
INSURE THAT THERE'S SOME SORT

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:17.987
OF QUALITY CONTROL. AND THAT

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:19.656
WAS OUR SENATOR DID U. S. C. IS

WE- DON'T WANT THESE DELIVERY

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.327
COMPANIES TO COME IN AND PICK

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.495
UP FOOD FROM A RESTAURANT APART

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:27.263

PLATFORMS. YOUR MISTER KELLY I

00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:35.171
THINK ANY RESTAURANT COULD DENY

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:37.941
SERVICE THAN IN ANY CONTACT-

00:59:38.007 --> 00:59:40.910
THE ISSUE HERE IS. THAT YOU

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:42.412

00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:43.880
COME IN A- NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:46.049
WAYS. AND ALL MISS GONZALEZ IS

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:47.483
ASKING FOR. WHICH WE

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:50.186
APPRECIATE. IT SOME LEVEL OF

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:52.322
CONSENT FROM THE RESTAURANT. SO

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:54.757
THAT THE IMPLIED RELATIONSHIP

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:58.261
TO THE PUBLIC. IS TRUE OR- IN

00:59:58.328 --> 00:59:59.996
MANY CASES WHICH MAKES THE

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.598
PRICE PEOPLE THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:03.733
INDEPENDENT RESTAURANT THAT

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.668
ACTUALLY DO NOT. WANT HARD TO

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:07.203
DELIVER IT THEIR PRODUCT MAY

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.138
NOT LEND ITSELF WELL TO TRAVEL

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.673
OR THEY MAY NOT JUST BE ABLE TO

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.342
DO THE LOGISTICS OF IT OR THERE

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:13.242
MAY BE A NUMBER ABOUT THE

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:15.645
RECENT SO. THERE SEEMS TO BE

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:16.913
DRIVING A CONVERSATION TO SOME

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.948

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:21.017
RESTAURANT ONE OF THE LIST AND

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:23.286
IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T AND SO

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.588
WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING. FOR SOME

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:29.559

01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:38.968
JUST A BRIEF COMMENT I JUST

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:39.902
WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:40.937
THIS BILL YOU KNOW IT'S A

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:42.338
SINGLE ANECDOTE BUT IT HAPPENED

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.539
TO A SMALL RESTAURANT THAT I

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:46.175
LOVE. SIX OR SEAT RESTAURANT

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.410
SIX TABLE RESTAURANT THEY

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.511
COULDN'T HANDLE THE CAPACITY

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:49.912
WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO THEM AND

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:50.546
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:52.015
ON AND THEY COULDN'T SERVE

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:54.050
THEIR CLIENTELE IN THE WAY THEY

WANTED AND THEY COULDN'T GET

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.085
OUT OF IT. AND SO I THINK THIS

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.220

A MISTER GOING AT FIRST I MEAN

THINK THIS IS A REALLY

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:16.172
IMPORTANT ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:19.308
THESE TIMES BECAUSE- IN DURING

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.044
THIS COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.412
CERTAINLY RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:25.648
IMPACTED GREATLY- BEAN. ONLY

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.483
ABLE TO DO TAKE OUT AND

DELIVERY- HAS BEEN A HUGE

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:31.220
IMPACT TO THEM AND THEN MORE

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:33.189
MORE PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON THE

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:37.226
SERVICES- TO GET DELIVERIES YOU

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:39.762

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.166
THERE THAT IS THAT IS COME UP

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.201
IN SOCIETY IN THE MARKET. OF

ALLOWING THESE. DELIVERIES AND

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.705
I THINK IT HELPS YOU KNOW AND

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:52.375
IT HELPS RESTAURANTS AND IT'S

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:58.815
HELPS THE CONSUMER. BUT I MEAN

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.750

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:03.386
TESTIMONY HERE. IT IS NOW IN

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:05.321
QUESTION- AND I THINK SOME OF

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:06.155
THIS CAN BE DEALT WITH IN THE

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.690
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS YOU AS

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:09.058
YOU SUGGEST BECAUSE WE GET INTO

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.893
SOME LEGAL ISSUES ABOUT

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.496
COPYRIGHT LAW AND- SUCH A THOSE

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:17.066
CAN BE HANDLED THERE- BUT IT IS

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:19.235
INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT- THE

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.069
ON THE ONE HAND I THINK YOU

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:22.472
MIGHT SAY. WHO WHO WHO WHO WHO

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.507
WOULD NOT WANT FREE ADVERTISING

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.609
RIGHT- THAT THERE'S A COMPANY

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:27.810
OUT THERE IS GOING TO PUT YOUR

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.712
BUSINESS'S NAME OUT THERE AND

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.647
NOT CHARGE YOU FOR IT. IS NOT A

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:34.450
GOOD THING FOR A BUSINESS. YEAH

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.986
HOWEVER. AS BEEN POINT ON ON.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.788
THIS TESTIMONY IS SORT OF SUEDE

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.424
MY- FEELINGS ON THIS IS OKAY

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.758
WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED FOR

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.128
THOSE ORDERS RIGHT AND YOU AND

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.729
YOU HAVEN'T HAD. THAT TIME AND

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.898
THEN. SOMEBODY SUGGESTED WELL

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:49.765
YOU COULD JUST SAY HEY WE'RE

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.734
NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH YOU OKAY

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:52.768
BUT NOW THAT CUSTOMER DOESN'T

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.370
GET. THE PRODUCT THAT THEY

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.705
THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING AND

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:56.539
THEY AND THEY WERE ASSUMING

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.406
THERE WAS SOME SORT OF

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:58.975
RELATIONSHIP WHO DOES THAT LOOK

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.376
BAD ON. IT LOOKS BAD ON THE

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.678
RESTAURANT. IT LOOKS BAD ON

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:04.647
THE- DELIVERY COMPANY TO. BUT

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.349
IT LOOKS BAD ON THE RESTAURANT.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.316
AS A THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:10.186
THROUGH- AND SO THAT AND THAT'S

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:11.120
CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:15.158
THEY ASK FOR- AND- SO I THINK

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:15.958
THAT IS A- AN IMPORTANT

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:18.194
QUESTION AND- I'LL COME IN A

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:19.295
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT'S NOT BEFORE

STARTED OUT WITH THIS OKAY WHO-

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.469
WHO WHO'S- TUMORS ARE THESE.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:27.803

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.272

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.041
SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:34.810
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. IS I

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.579
THINK IN A LOT OF CASES IF

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:37.580
YOU'RE IN YOUR HOME

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.081

BELONGS TO THE RESTAURANT-

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.071

BERMAN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:28.883
ISSUE I THINK YOU'RE RAISING A

01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:31.085
NORMALLY I AM VERY SKEPTICAL OF

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.221
LEGISLATION THAT IT ATTEMPTS TO

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:34.422
INSERT ITSELF INTO THE

01:31:34.488 --> 01:31:36.290
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A BUYER

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:39.160
AND A SELLER BUT I THINK THAT.

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:40.027
GOVERNMENT HAS AN IMPORTANT

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:42.296
ROLE TO FILL IN ENSURING THAT

01:31:42.363 --> 01:31:44.999
FREE MARKETS FUNCTION AND EXIST

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:47.168
AND IN THIS CASE I THINK THAT

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:48.269
THE DEFINITION OF A FREE MARKET

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:49.637
IS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:50.838
WILLING BUYER AND A WILLING

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:53.741
SELLER AND IF THE BUYER IS NOT

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:55.209
WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE OF THE

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:56.544
THAT RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION

01:31:56.611 --> 01:31:57.511
BECAUSE THEY ARE ON AWARE OF

01:31:57.578 --> 01:31:58.613
IT. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

01:31:58.679 --> 01:31:59.714
THAT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.915
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO I MEAN

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:02.717
I SEE WE HAVE A OPPOSE

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:04.785
RECOMMENDATION ON MY ANALYSIS

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:05.553
HERE BUT I REALLY THINK THAT

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.354
YOU'RE RAISING AN ISSUE THAT

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.055
NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH. BOB I

01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:09.590
DO HOWEVER THINK THAT THE

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:11.392
OPPOSITION HAS RAISED SOME GOOD

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:13.728
POINTS AND IN PARTICULAR IF

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:15.563
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS-

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:17.198
I THINK THAT THE POINT ABOUT-

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:21.168
VERY SHORT DESCRIPTIONS IT IS A

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:23.404
GOOD ONE IF YOU HAVE A ONE DAY

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:26.474
SUBSCRIPTION AND THERE'S THIS

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.810
IS DESCRIBE EITHER ONE AT A

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:33.080
TIME. I'LL BE DAY NOT IS NOT A

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:36.050
TO HAVE THAT. ARE I THINK THE A

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.985
GOOD CASE WAS MY RAISED ABOUT A

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:39.420
SOME REASONABLE REQUIRE

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:40.454
ESTABLISHED AND IT'S AN SUMER

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:43.057
THAT'S SUBSCRIPTION SO YOU KNOW

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:45.026
THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL I WAS

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:46.494
A LAST MINUTE AMEND. BUT I

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.695
THINK IT NEEDS SOME TO AND TURN

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:51.098
OF THE RE STAFF THAT THE- BLAUT

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:56.337

METHOD OF CANCELLATION FIRST IF

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:01.008
YOU DON'T HAVE AN ELECT.

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:02.310
RELATION WITH A CO. THAT'S

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:03.110
REALLY NOT ADDRESS THE BILL I

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:05.246
THINK THAT THOSE THINGS ARE-

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:06.547

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:08.849

ABOUT IT'S AN ISSUE THIS

04:03:46.411 --> 04:03:47.579
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN GRAPPLING

04:03:47.646 --> 04:03:48.847
WITH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

04:03:48.914 --> 04:03:50.349
YEARS AND I THINK THE REASON

04:03:50.415 --> 04:03:51.750
WHY IT'S SUCH A DIFFICULT

04:03:51.817 --> 04:03:52.951
ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

04:03:53.018 --> 04:03:55.454
SOMETHING THAT- ISN'T

04:03:55.520 --> 04:03:57.689
INHERENTLY SOMETHING THAT WE

04:03:57.756 --> 04:04:01.059
KEEP PRIVATE. UNTIL WE ARE

04:04:01.126 --> 04:04:02.894
THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF

04:04:02.961 --> 04:04:04.129
HAVING THAT INFORMATION SHARED

04:04:04.196 --> 04:04:06.598
ON A MASS LEVEL SO YOU KNOW THE

04:04:06.665 --> 04:04:08.834
FACT THAT I RECOGNIZE YOUR FACE

04:04:08.900 --> 04:04:10.235
WILL BE SITTING HERE AND I CAN

04:04:10.302 --> 04:04:12.204
TELL MY WIFE- TONIGHT I RAN

04:04:12.270 --> 04:04:14.172
INTO CHECK OUT THE CAPITAL YOU

04:04:14.239 --> 04:04:15.807
KNOW THAT'S NOT A PIECE OF

04:04:15.874 --> 04:04:16.675
PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT I

04:04:16.742 --> 04:04:18.443
REVEALED ABOUT YOU BUT I'M WE

04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:20.178
EXPAND THAT TO BEING DONE

04:04:20.245 --> 04:04:22.014
MILLIONS MILLIONS OF TIMES A

04:04:22.080 --> 04:04:23.882
DAY- THROUGH AN AUTOMATED

04:04:23.949 --> 04:04:25.417
PROCESS IT RAISES SOME VERY

04:04:25.484 --> 04:04:27.853
TROUBLING ETHICAL CONCERNS SO I

04:04:27.919 --> 04:04:29.955
THINK THAT THAT'S WHY WERE

04:04:30.022 --> 04:04:30.956
GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE.

04:04:31.023 --> 04:04:33.425
HOWEVER I ALSO THINK IT'S WORTH

04:04:33.492 --> 04:04:34.926
VISUAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

04:04:34.993 --> 04:04:39.865
IS ENABLING SOME. SOME BEHAVIOR

04:04:39.931 --> 04:04:42.200
THAT'S VERY BENEFICIAL TO ALL

04:04:42.267 --> 04:04:44.302
OF US HERE IN SOCIETY. AND I

04:04:44.369 --> 04:04:45.203
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

04:04:45.270 --> 04:04:46.471
ESTABLISH A REGULATORY

04:04:46.538 --> 04:04:49.307
FRAMEWORK THAT DOESN'T- DENY US

04:04:49.374 --> 04:04:50.976
THE BENEFITS OF THAT. AND

04:04:51.043 --> 04:04:52.044
UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL THAT YOU

04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:54.012
PUT TOGETHER HERE IT SEEMS TO

04:04:54.079 --> 04:04:56.648
ME IS NOT FOCUS SO MUCH ON. THE

04:04:56.715 --> 04:04:57.849
POTENTIAL ABSES OF THE

04:04:57.916 --> 04:05:00.052
TECHNOLOGY IS IT IS TRYING TO

04:05:00.118 --> 04:05:02.921
CHECK ALL THE BOXES ABOUT WHAT

04:05:02.988 --> 04:05:03.555
PEOPLE HAVE TO DO TO DEPLOY IT.

04:05:03.622 --> 04:05:04.189
I THINK WE BE BETTER SERVED IF

04:05:04.256 --> 04:05:06.892
WE JUST FOCUSED ON. THE PUT THE

04:05:06.958 --> 04:05:09.628
POTENTIAL ABUSES AND PASSED

04:05:09.694 --> 04:05:13.565
LEGISLATION TO CURBING THOSE.

04:05:13.632 --> 04:05:14.633

WITH RUN OF OUR- THAT THAT'S

04:05:20.972 --> 04:05:21.606
POTENTIALLY BY. USE OF THE-

04:05:21.673 --> 04:05:23.775
RIGHT THROUGH AND TRY WE'RE NOT

TRACE- SUSPECTED CASES- I KNOW

04:05:32.651 --> 04:05:34.286
THAT I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED

PARTICULAR- YOU KNOW USE BUT

04:06:14.993 --> 04:06:16.027
BUT I DON'T THINK IT DOES I

04:06:16.094 --> 04:06:17.395
MEAN I THINK WOULD DEPEND ON

04:06:17.462 --> 04:06:20.265
THE SOURCE OF THE IMAGE THAT

04:06:20.332 --> 04:06:21.166
YOU'RE USING FOR FEDERAL

04:06:21.233 --> 04:06:23.168
RECOGNITION IF IT WAS A PROP

DID HAVE THAT I WOULDN'T DO IT

04:06:30.008 --> 04:06:32.244
WOULD BE AN ILLEGAL USE OF

04:06:32.310 --> 04:06:34.646
CAUGHT GO HEAD TO HEAD YEAH YOU

04:06:34.713 --> 04:06:37.182
PUBLIC COURSE DE. WE NEED SOME

04:06:37.249 --> 04:06:39.417

OUR IT IS THAT. YOU KNOW I.

04:06:47.759 --> 04:06:48.727
PEOPLE COULD. USE IT FOR.

04:06:48.793 --> 04:06:51.830
THAT'S UP A- IN THE PUBLIC. I

04:06:51.897 --> 04:06:54.633

SOMETHING ABOUT THE CLEAR FEEL

04:07:02.974 --> 04:07:05.076
A AYE PARTICULAR SITUATION

04:07:05.143 --> 04:07:07.045
WHERE THEY WERE ACTUALLY

04:07:07.112 --> 04:07:09.981
PROVIDING IMAGES THAT WERE NOT

04:07:10.048 --> 04:07:11.683
ONLY IN THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO

04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:15.453
OBTAINED ARE BY AND- TRANSFER

04:07:15.520 --> 04:07:19.191
FROM AS A FACEBOOK. SO THE BILL

04:07:19.257 --> 04:07:22.127
AT IS AS IS IT IS WRITTEN AUG

04:07:22.194 --> 04:07:25.697
WILL ONLY ALLOW FOR THE

04:07:25.764 --> 04:07:27.632
RETENTION OF INFORMATION THAT'S

04:07:27.699 --> 04:07:31.069
UP IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. SO

04:07:31.136 --> 04:07:33.572
OBSOLETE SO THAT THAT IS YOU

04:07:33.638 --> 04:07:36.408
KNOW HOW THAT IS WORKING. OKAY

04:07:36.474 --> 04:07:38.343
SO YEAH IT'S MAKING SURE THAT

04:07:38.410 --> 04:07:41.346
THOSE RAN RIGHT IF I MIGHT JUMP

04:07:41.413 --> 04:07:42.113
IN THIS IS RIGHT HARKENS OF

04:07:42.180 --> 04:07:43.949
MICROSOFT I DON'T BELIEVE THE

04:07:44.015 --> 04:07:46.718
BILL WOULD. PROHIBIT THE USE OF

04:07:46.785 --> 04:07:47.986
FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

04:07:48.053 --> 04:07:50.155
FOR THOSE SORT THE PURPOSES- IT

04:07:50.222 --> 04:07:52.057
IT YOU KNOW. BUT ON THE ONE

04:07:52.123 --> 04:07:56.061
HAND REQUIRE- CONSENT- IF A

04:07:56.127 --> 04:07:57.529
PRIVATE SOURCES INTENDING TO

04:07:57.596 --> 04:08:01.466
USE THE- TECHNOLOGY FOR THOSE

04:08:01.533 --> 04:08:03.868
KINDS OF PURPOSES. ON THE OTHER

04:08:03.935 --> 04:08:07.539
HAND- NOT UNLESS. A GOVERNMENT%

04:08:07.606 --> 04:08:11.409
AGENCY IS ENGAGING AND- ONGOING

04:08:11.476 --> 04:08:12.911
SURVEILLANCE THEY THEY WOULD

04:08:12.978 --> 04:08:15.947
NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE ONE

04:08:16.014 --> 04:08:19.751
FIREMAN. SO IT IT'S KIND OF

04:08:19.818 --> 04:08:21.386
SPLIT HAIRS BUT- I THINK IT'S

04:08:21.453 --> 04:08:23.488
AN IMPORTANT STATION THAT- THE

04:08:23.555 --> 04:08:25.423
FACT THAT I HAVEN'T GIVEN MY

04:08:25.490 --> 04:08:27.659
CONSENT UNTIL AFTER THE FACT

04:08:27.726 --> 04:08:28.860
YOU KNOW WHERE I SAID OKAY I

04:08:28.927 --> 04:08:30.262
WOULD LIKE I'M IN NOW

04:08:30.328 --> 04:08:32.063
INTERESTED IN. HAVING YOU CAN

04:08:32.130 --> 04:08:33.498
TRACE ME MEANS THAT GOTTA GO

04:08:33.565 --> 04:08:36.401
BACK AND ANALYZE ALL OF THE

04:08:36.468 --> 04:08:38.069
PLACES I MIGHT HAVE BEEN. AS A

04:08:38.136 --> 04:08:39.704
POOR TO YOU KNOW FORWARD

04:08:39.771 --> 04:08:42.774
PROCESS WHERE- WHERE YOU'RE

04:08:42.841 --> 04:08:45.043
ANALYZING IT AS GO AND THEN I

04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:47.746
SAY YES I LIKE TO OPEN THE

04:08:47.812 --> 04:08:50.181
XPOSED ANYWAY LET'S MOVE OUR

04:08:50.248 --> 04:08:50.715
FROM THAT BECAUSE I DON'T

04:08:50.782 --> 04:08:51.316
BELIEVE THE POINT BUT READING

04:08:51.383 --> 04:08:52.784
OF THE OF THAT THAT'S A PART.

04:08:52.851 --> 04:08:55.186
BETTER USE THAT MY READING THE

04:08:55.253 --> 04:08:59.858
BOOKS WITH A LAUGH YEAH THAT'S

04:08:59.924 --> 04:09:04.529
WHAT I MEAN THEY'RE PROBABLY.

04:09:04.596 --> 04:09:05.130
UNDER THE BENEFIT. IS WHERE.

04:09:05.196 --> 04:09:08.199
NEW THEM. SINCE BUT NEVER

04:09:08.266 --> 04:09:10.502
DEVELOP. WE'RE NOT. MISS IT OFF

04:09:10.568 --> 04:09:12.070
IN OUR APPROACH TO REGULATING.

04:09:12.137 --> 04:09:13.672
UP I HAVE A FALL QUESTION CARE

04:09:13.738 --> 04:09:16.474
ABOUT. A FEDERAL LAW. THERE WAS

04:09:16.541 --> 04:09:17.042
A CASE INTO. ELEVEN IN THE

04:09:17.108 --> 04:09:18.310
SUPREME. WHERE IT WAS IT WAS A-

04:09:18.376 --> 04:09:19.544
<i><u>N. X. THAT. IT REGARD A RELATE</i></u>

04:09:19.611 --> 04:09:21.413
TO THE- OF IN. THAT WAS

04:09:21.479 --> 04:09:24.516
COLLECTED BY A BUSINESS. AND

04:09:24.582 --> 04:09:26.685
THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN THAT

04:09:26.751 --> 04:09:30.221
CASE. THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS.

04:09:30.288 --> 04:09:32.324
OF MAN RUSSIAN OF FREE SPEECH

04:09:32.390 --> 04:09:33.725
COMMERCIAL FREE SPEECH. YEAH

04:09:33.792 --> 04:09:35.193
ND I AM AND IT WAS A PRETTY

04:09:35.260 --> 04:09:36.961
STARKLY WORDED DECISION AND I'M

04:09:37.028 --> 04:09:39.964
WONDERING HOW. THIS WOULD NOT

04:09:40.031 --> 04:09:41.566
BE FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL

04:09:41.633 --> 04:09:42.834
UNDER THAT DECISION BECAUSE

04:09:42.901 --> 04:09:45.203
PRETTY CLEARLY. IT IS S. AS

04:09:45.270 --> 04:09:46.504
REGARDS THE PART OF THE BILL

04:09:46.571 --> 04:09:47.839
THAT PUTS RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT

04:09:47.906 --> 04:09:49.107
BUSINESSES CAN DO WITH

04:09:49.174 --> 04:09:50.608
INFORMATION IS GATHERED ON

04:09:50.675 --> 04:09:52.577
THEIR PROMISED- PRETTY CLEARLY

04:09:52.644 --> 04:09:54.913
THAT WOULD FALL UNDER. THAT

04:09:54.979 --> 04:09:57.182
SAME CABIN INFORMATION NOT. I

04:09:57.248 --> 04:10:01.553
MR AGAINST AN ACID QUESTION.

04:10:01.619 --> 04:10:03.922
YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU

04:10:03.988 --> 04:10:04.556
FOR THE QUESTION I THINK YOU'RE

04:10:04.622 --> 04:10:05.990
REFERRING TO THE STORE OVER

04:10:06.057 --> 04:10:07.192
BECAUSE I AND THAT'S HEALTH

04:10:07.258 --> 04:10:10.628
RATED KATE- AND FOR A NUMBER OF

04:10:10.695 --> 04:10:13.865
REASONS- I THINK AT BEST YOU

04:10:13.932 --> 04:10:16.668
CAN SAY THAT THE IMPLICATIONS

04:10:16.735 --> 04:10:20.438
OF THAT CASE ON. ANY LAW THAT-REGULATES. THE COLLECTION AND

04:10:20.505 --> 04:10:21.973
USE OF DATA PRIVACY LAWS THAT

04:10:22.040 --> 04:10:25.643
THIS LAW. IT IS DEBATABLE. I DO

04:10:25.710 --> 04:10:27.979
NOT THINK THAT IT WOULD RENDER

04:10:28.046 --> 04:10:30.115
THIS PLOT WAR BUT PRIVACY LAWS

04:10:30.181 --> 04:10:32.016
MORE GENERALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL

04:10:32.083 --> 04:10:34.352
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. AMONG

04:10:34.419 --> 04:10:36.254
OTHERS- JUSTICE KENNEDY IN THAT

04:10:36.321 --> 04:10:39.924
CASE. NOTED THAT THEY WERE NOT-

04:10:39.991 --> 04:10:43.027
RENDERING A DECISION AND- ADD

04:10:43.094 --> 04:10:44.963
TO THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT

04:10:45.029 --> 04:10:47.699
BETWEEN THE FIRST AMENDMENT-

04:10:47.766 --> 04:10:50.068
AND PRIVATE LAWS IN THE PAST

04:10:50.135 --> 04:10:53.905
THE TECH. LOGY TO- TO LACK

04:10:53.972 --> 04:10:56.574
INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE. THERE

04:10:56.641 --> 04:10:58.877
THAT NUMBER OTHER REASONS WHY I

04:10:58.943 --> 04:11:00.378
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT CASE

04:11:00.445 --> 04:11:03.281
WOULD. INVALIDATE THE PRIVACY

04:11:03.348 --> 04:11:07.051
LAWS OR- IN WITH WHICH WE CAN%

04:11:07.118 --> 04:11:09.053
GO INTO IF WE HAD MORE TIME.

04:11:09.120 --> 04:11:13.525
SURE YOU KNOW I WELL I THINK AT

04:11:13.591 --> 04:11:15.059
THE VERY LEAST. WE'LL THIS LAW

04:11:15.126 --> 04:11:15.693
WHAT IF IT PASSED FACED A

04:11:15.760 --> 04:11:17.762
CONCERT JAIL. AND I HAVE TO

04:11:17.829 --> 04:11:19.097
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I

04:11:19.164 --> 04:11:19.664
ACTUALLY THINK IT WOULD IT

04:11:19.731 --> 04:11:21.433
WOULD BE OVERTURNED. I FOR THE

04:11:21.499 --> 04:11:22.534
SAME REASONS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

04:11:22.600 --> 04:11:23.635
TALKING ABOUT DATA THAT'S

04:11:23.701 --> 04:11:25.503
INHERENTLY PRIVATE WHEN I TALK

04:11:25.570 --> 04:11:26.871
ABOUT SOMEONE SOCIAL SECURITY

04:11:26.938 --> 04:11:28.239
NUMBER WE TALK ABOUT SOMEONE'S

04:11:28.306 --> 04:11:29.374
APPEARANCE WHICH IS SOMETHING

04:11:29.441 --> 04:11:30.508
THAT WE REVEAL TO EACH OTHER

04:11:30.575 --> 04:11:35.914
EVERY DAY. SO I SOME. OF WAS

04:11:35.980 --> 04:11:37.615

I CAN SUPPORT. TODAY I THINK

04:11:42.387 --> 04:11:43.455
IT'S AN INDICATION THAT YOU'VE

04:11:43.521 --> 04:11:45.190

YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR THAT MAYBE

04:11:51.729 --> 04:11:53.431
MEANS THAT YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT

04:11:53.498 --> 04:11:54.999

WOULD HAVE TO BE READ REVIEW BY

04:14:21.879 --> 04:14:26.484
A HUMAN BEING WE'VE BEEN TRYING

04:14:26.551 --> 04:14:27.919
AS TO WHO'S GONNA. GEN THEN NOT

04:14:27.986 --> 04:14:29.587
COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THAT

04:14:29.654 --> 04:14:34.325
THE SELF. YEAH SOME MISTER

04:14:34.392 --> 04:14:35.793

AGAIN- I THINK YOU KNOW THAT

04:14:40.098 --> 04:14:42.634
THAT IS A DEFINED TERM IN THE

04:14:42.700 --> 04:14:45.637
BILL. AND IT DOES PROVIDE AS AS

04:14:45.703 --> 04:14:47.572
MISTER CHAIR OF NOTED THAT THAT

04:14:47.639 --> 04:14:49.040
THE IN AN INDIVIDUAL MUST BE

04:14:49.107 --> 04:14:51.342
TRAINED AND IT ALSO MUST BE

04:14:51.409 --> 04:14:52.076
SOMEONE WHO IS ULTIMATELY

04:14:52.143 --> 04:14:53.611
RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE

04:14:53.678 --> 04:14:55.647
DECISION. SO IT AS BEST WE READ

04:14:55.713 --> 04:14:58.149
THAT ANYWAY EIGHT- I THINK THAT

04:14:58.216 --> 04:15:00.585
THE CLEAR INTENT IT IS THE

04:15:00.652 --> 04:15:02.920
INDICATE THAT YOU CAN'T JUST BE

04:15:02.987 --> 04:15:04.856
A LOW LEVEL EMPLOYEE WHO SIMPLY

04:15:04.922 --> 04:15:06.958
PUSHING A BUTTON OR OR MOVING

04:15:07.025 --> 04:15:09.827
PAPERS ACROSS HER DESK IT HAS

04:15:09.894 --> 04:15:11.796
TO BE SOMEONE. WITH AUTHORITY

04:15:11.863 --> 04:15:13.598
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION TO

04:15:13.665 --> 04:15:14.866
RENDER THE DECISION AND SOMEONE

04:15:14.932 --> 04:15:16.401
FRANKLYWHO CAN CHANGE THE

04:15:16.467 --> 04:15:19.070
DECISION- YOU KNOW IT MAY BE

04:15:19.137 --> 04:15:21.239
THAT THERE IS THE NEED FOR

04:15:21.305 --> 04:15:22.674
ADDITIONAL. THE FLUSH OUT WHAT

04:15:22.740 --> 04:15:26.210
THAT IS- BUT WE THINK THAT THE

04:15:26.277 --> 04:15:27.679
CURRENT DEFINITION THE BILL IT

04:15:27.745 --> 04:15:30.415
IS A GOOD START- IN WOULD START

04:15:30.481 --> 04:15:31.749
TO. YOU KNOW PUT SOME

04:15:31.816 --> 04:15:33.751
RESTRICTIONS AROUND AN AREA

04:15:33.818 --> 04:15:37.188
WHERE THERE REALLY AREN'T

04:15:37.255 --> 04:15:38.723
RESTRICTIONS TODAY. THANK THANK

04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:40.458
YOU AND I GUESS YEAH MY CONCERN

04:15:40.525 --> 04:15:44.028
IS THAT. IT THE MOTIVATIONS

04:15:44.095 --> 04:15:45.463
BEHIND THAT HUMAN REVIEW THAT

04:15:45.530 --> 04:15:46.998
ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT

04:15:47.065 --> 04:15:48.299
AND SO YOU KNOW HE JUST LEAVE

04:15:48.366 --> 04:15:52.570
IT TO THAT COMPANY. YOU KNOW IF

04:15:52.637 --> 04:15:53.638
THE COMPANY IS TELLING THAT

04:15:53.705 --> 04:15:55.339
PERSON HIGH LEVEL LOW LEVEL MID

04:15:55.406 --> 04:15:57.041
LEVEL WHATEVER TRAIN NOT

04:15:57.108 --> 04:15:59.844
TRAINED. YEAH DID TO IMPROVE

04:15:59.911 --> 04:16:02.046
USES THAT SHOULDN'T BE APPROVED

04:16:02.113 --> 04:16:05.249
THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM- AND SO

04:16:05.316 --> 04:16:05.917
I DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA

04:16:05.983 --> 04:16:08.720
THAT THAT NEED MORE DEFINITION.

04:16:08.786 --> 04:16:11.322
THE BILL SHOULD THERE BE SOME

04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:14.525
BASE SO FOR. WHAT IN BECAUSE-

04:16:14.592 --> 04:16:15.893
NECESSARY FOR THE PROVISION OF

04:16:15.960 --> 04:16:17.595
THAT SERVICE. MEANS AND THIS IS

04:16:17.662 --> 04:16:20.131
KIND OF THE SAME ISSUE- WHERE

04:16:20.198 --> 04:16:21.966
YOU KNOW HE IS A PROBLEMATIC TO

04:16:22.033 --> 04:16:23.735
JUST LEAVE TO EACH BUSINESS. TO

04:16:23.801 --> 04:16:25.803
DECIDE WHAT IS. CAN QUOTE

04:16:25.870 --> 04:16:27.905
DIRECTLY NECESSARY FOR THE

04:16:27.972 --> 04:16:29.841
PROVISION OF THAT SERVICE. OR

04:16:29.907 --> 04:16:30.641
MAYBE THERE'S MORE DEFINITION

04:16:30.708 --> 04:16:32.910
THE BILL THAT THAT THAT I

04:16:32.977 --> 04:16:35.513
MISSED ALREADY. I THINK WHAT

04:16:35.580 --> 04:16:37.148
YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS- ONE OF

04:16:37.215 --> 04:16:38.683
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE-

04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:42.153
CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER. I

04:16:42.220 --> 04:16:45.556
BELIEVE- SECTION THREE TEN E.

04:16:45.623 --> 04:16:48.426
ONE OR THEREABOUTS AND- MAYBE

04:16:48.493 --> 04:16:50.394
MAYBE THE BEST WAY TO TOOL-

04:16:50.461 --> 04:16:52.497
RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION IS- IT

04:16:52.563 --> 04:16:53.631
BY USING AN X. AN EXAMPLE FOR

04:16:53.698 --> 04:16:56.434
EXAMPLE- FOR EXAMPLE YOU HOW-

04:16:56.501 --> 04:16:59.170
SOMEBODY USING AND HOW. THAT

04:16:59.237 --> 04:17:02.874
WOULD. POSSIBLY CAPTURE THE

04:17:02.940 --> 04:17:05.710
IMAGE OF THE LAYER- SO THE

04:17:05.777 --> 04:17:10.248
LEVEL OF- CONSENT. IS REQUIRE

04:17:10.314 --> 04:17:11.816
AND THE BILL IN SUCH A WAY THAT

04:17:11.883 --> 04:17:13.718
GIVE GIVE THE GAME ITSELF IF

04:17:13.785 --> 04:17:15.486
THE APPLICATION ITSELF WHAT A

04:17:15.553 --> 04:17:17.789
REQUIRES. THE PERSON'S IMAGE TO

04:17:17.855 --> 04:17:19.624
BE CAPTURED AND THAT IS THE

04:17:19.690 --> 04:17:21.225
THAT IS THE CONSENT THAT DOES

04:17:21.292 --> 04:17:23.895
REQUIRE NOW HOW HOWEVER IF THAT

04:17:23.961 --> 04:17:25.396
PICTURE OF THE OF THAT IMAGE

04:17:25.463 --> 04:17:27.198
HAS TO BE USED FOR SOMETHING

04:17:27.265 --> 04:17:31.068
ELSE. OF THE ADULT SO. CONSENT

04:17:31.135 --> 04:17:34.138
WOULD BE NEEDED AS WELL NOW.

04:17:34.205 --> 04:17:38.743
THE ARE BUT IF YOU KNOW THE

04:17:38.810 --> 04:17:40.244
FACT THAT THE PERSON GIVES

04:17:40.311 --> 04:17:41.112
CONSENT FIRST TIME DOESN'T MEAN

04:17:41.179 --> 04:17:43.648
THAT YOU KNOW IF I CAN COULD BE

04:17:43.714 --> 04:17:45.249
FOR FURTHER DISSEMINATED TO A

04:17:45.316 --> 04:17:47.785
THIRD PERSON. SO IF THAT

04:17:47.852 --> 04:17:49.720
HAPPENS IN A SEPARATE TENTS AND

04:17:49.787 --> 04:17:52.757
WE REQUIRE. JOHN GOTCHA AN AID

04:17:52.824 --> 04:17:53.925
AGAIN THE KIND OF SOMEONE A

04:17:53.991 --> 04:17:54.759
LAST QUESTION MY CONCERN IS

04:17:54.826 --> 04:17:57.862
JUST. ANY BODY CAN JUSTIFY

04:17:57.929 --> 04:18:00.531
REASON TO USE ANYTHING- AND SO

04:18:00.598 --> 04:18:02.834
IF THERE ARE NO STANDARDS THERE

04:18:02.900 --> 04:18:05.436
FOR HOUSTON PERMISSIVE USES. OF

04:18:05.503 --> 04:18:06.370
THE YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE.

04:18:06.437 --> 04:18:07.605
DIRECTLY NECESSARY FOR THE

04:18:07.672 --> 04:18:08.573
VERSION OF THAT SERVICE IS SO

04:18:08.639 --> 04:18:12.009
VERY THAT THAT YEAH YOU CAN

04:18:12.076 --> 04:18:15.746
PROBABLY JUSTIFY ANY. DECISION

04:18:15.813 --> 04:18:18.182
YOU KNOW BASED ON ON THAT KIND

04:18:18.249 --> 04:18:19.483
OF A DESCRIPTION SO I THINK

04:18:19.550 --> 04:18:21.085
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

04:18:21.152 --> 04:18:22.420
NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY

04:18:22.486 --> 04:18:25.189
TIGHTENED UP- AND THEN IT YOU

04:18:25.256 --> 04:18:28.326
KNOW I AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS

04:18:28.392 --> 04:18:31.896
AROUND- YOU KNOW. THIS

04:18:31.963 --> 04:18:34.498
TECHNOLOGY NOT BEING USED FOR

04:18:34.565 --> 04:18:38.236
NOT REINFORCING BIAS HE'S

04:18:38.302 --> 04:18:40.371
AROUND RACE AND GENDER AND AGE-

04:18:40.438 --> 04:18:41.706
SO I GUESS YEAH CAN YOU TELL ME

04:18:41.772 --> 04:18:42.406
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

04:18:42.473 --> 04:18:43.975
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE

04:18:44.041 --> 04:18:46.077
TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE USE OF

04:18:46.143 --> 04:18:47.578
THIS TECHNOLOGY ISN'T BIASED

04:18:47.645 --> 04:18:49.513
BASED ON- YOU KNOW THOSE

04:18:49.580 --> 04:18:52.049
FACTORS CHAIR I THINK THERE'S

04:18:52.116 --> 04:18:54.051
SEVERAL LEVELS OF PROTECTION IN

04:18:54.118 --> 04:18:55.820
THAT REGARD FIRST OF ALL OF THE

04:18:55.887 --> 04:18:58.823
LAW REQUIRES THE OF TESTING TO

04:18:58.890 --> 04:19:00.524
BE DONE THE TESTING HAS TO BE

04:19:00.591 --> 04:19:03.761
INDEPENDENT ARE. A WELL. MAKE

04:19:03.828 --> 04:19:08.766
SURE THAT OF. DE OF SUB GROUPS

04:19:08.833 --> 04:19:09.500
AND NOT BEING DISCRIMINATED

04:19:09.567 --> 04:19:11.636
AGAINST. OF YEAH WE ALSO

04:19:11.702 --> 04:19:13.938
PROVIDED THE THIS STANDARD AS

04:19:14.005 --> 04:19:15.506
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. SO NOW

04:19:15.573 --> 04:19:18.542
PERSON- USING THE TECHNOLOGY

04:19:18.609 --> 04:19:21.078
WOULD HAVE. TO BASICALLY

04:19:21.145 --> 04:19:22.747
SUPPLIED THE WHAT THEY CALLED

04:19:22.813 --> 04:19:25.983
IN ON. THE API WHICH QUALITY

04:19:26.050 --> 04:19:26.851
APPLICATION PROGRAMMING

04:19:26.918 --> 04:19:29.687
INTERFACE. FOR AN INDEPENDENT

04:19:29.754 --> 04:19:32.089
PARTY TO VERIFY TO TELL US. AND

04:19:32.156 --> 04:19:34.425
IF THEY- IF THE TEST ACTUALLY

04:19:34.492 --> 04:19:36.861
COMPLIES WITH THE NEW STANDARD

04:19:36.928 --> 04:19:39.230
AND THERE OKAY. NOW ARE THAT'S

04:19:39.297 --> 04:19:41.899
ONE LEVEL OF SAFEGUARD THAT'S

04:19:41.966 --> 04:19:43.734
ON THE ON THE TESTING PART. NOW

04:19:43.801 --> 04:19:45.803
THE OTHER PART IS THAT. ON THE

04:19:45.870 --> 04:19:48.039
ENROLLMENT HE'S YOU KNOW BEFORE

04:19:48.105 --> 04:19:49.573
THE IMAGES- AND ROLLED INTO A

04:19:49.640 --> 04:19:51.509
DATABASE THAT A CONSENT YOU

04:19:51.575 --> 04:19:52.977
KNOW CONSENT WILL BE NEEDED AS

04:19:53.044 --> 04:19:56.047
WELL. SO THAT'S A SECOND. NOW

04:19:56.113 --> 04:19:59.417
THE PIECES THAT. WHEN IT COMES

04:19:59.483 --> 04:20:02.353
pTO SURVEILLANCE- EXAMPLE OF.

04:20:02.420 --> 04:20:04.555
YEAH THAT BE ALLOWED UNDER

04:20:04.622 --> 04:20:05.957
LIMITED SIR. THAT IS IF IT'S A

04:20:06.023 --> 04:20:08.059
SIN CRIME. AND ALSO IF THERE'S

04:20:08.125 --> 04:20:10.561
A WARRANT REQUIREMENT. BONTA AS

04:20:10.628 --> 04:20:12.163
WELL AS SET UP YOU KNOW THERE

04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:16.534
THERE'S ALSO THE- YOU KNOW THE

04:20:16.600 --> 04:20:17.868
PROVISION THAT WOULD PROHIBIT

04:20:17.935 --> 04:20:20.171
DISCRIMINATION ON THE FEDERAL

04:20:20.237 --> 04:20:28.512
AND STATE LAW. YEAH OKAY. I.

04:20:28.579 --> 04:20:30.414
I'M GONNA VERY BEGRUDGINGLY

04:20:30.481 --> 04:20:32.550
SUPPORT THIS TODAY TO GIVE YOU

04:20:32.616 --> 04:20:34.819
MORE TIME TO WORK ON A LOT OF

04:20:34.885 --> 04:20:36.387
THESE DETAILS WE GOT A LOT OF

04:20:36.454 --> 04:20:38.456
THIS VERY LATE AND DIDN'T HAVE

04:20:38.522 --> 04:20:39.357
A TON OF TIME TO WHAT YOU KNOW

04:20:39.423 --> 04:20:40.558
TO WORK WITH MY STAFF AND

04:20:40.624 --> 04:20:42.326
PERSONALLY REVIEW THINGS THIS

04:20:42.393 --> 04:20:43.627
IS AN IMPORTANT AREA WHERE

04:20:43.694 --> 04:20:45.329
THERE'S MINIMAL REGULATION

04:20:45.396 --> 04:20:47.231
EXISTING NOW AND SO I DO THINK

04:20:47.298 --> 04:20:49.100
SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN- I

04:20:49.166 --> 04:20:50.368
THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERNS

04:20:50.434 --> 04:20:52.303
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BY BY

04:20:52.370 --> 04:20:54.572
GROUPS ALL OF THE SPECTRUM-

04:20:54.638 --> 04:20:55.973
YEAH THERE ARE SOME VALID

04:20:56.040 --> 04:21:01.012
CONCERNS THERE- AND SO ON I NO

04:21:01.078 --> 04:21:01.879
ONE'S. AND RESPECT YOU IN THE

04:21:01.946 --> 04:21:03.581
KNOW THAT YOU. YOU'RE WORK.

04:21:03.647 --> 04:21:05.016
WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS I

04:21:05.082 --> 04:21:06.217
DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS BEING

04:21:06.283 --> 04:21:07.318
THE TECHNOLOGY AND I DON'T

04:21:07.385 --> 04:21:08.786
THINK THE ANSWER IS NOTHING.

04:21:08.853 --> 04:21:09.887
AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

04:21:09.954 --> 04:21:12.823
SOMETHING- BUT YOU KNOW THE GUY

04:21:12.890 --> 04:21:15.026
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE

04:21:15.092 --> 04:21:16.260
DONE I THINK TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

04:21:16.327 --> 04:21:17.762
THAT. WHAT THAT SWEET SPOT IS.

04:21:17.828 --> 04:21:21.499
OF EXPRESSED SOME OF MY- EARNS.

04:21:21.565 --> 04:21:24.268
THE OBVIOUS RESERVE. THE RIGHT

04:21:24.335 --> 04:21:25.703
TO. CHANGE THAT DECISION BASED

04:21:25.770 --> 04:21:28.105
ON HOW THIS GOAL PROGRESSES-

04:21:28.172 --> 04:21:29.740
BUT- I'LL BE WILLING TO GIVE

04:21:29.807 --> 04:21:32.109

LET YOU KEEP WORKING ON THIS

04:21:33.377 --> 04:21:35.579
IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THANK YOU. A

04:21:35.646 --> 04:21:40.317
SOMEONE OR ONE. I THINK OF THAT

04:21:40.384 --> 04:21:47.425
WAS LIFELONG DAY CREATE NEW OF

04:21:47.491 --> 04:21:52.163
WORKING ON THE RIGHT OR.

THAT THAT. THE IDEA OF CONSENT-

04:27:09.012 --> 04:27:10.581

A LITTLE BIT MORE AND ON THE

04:27:11.682 --> 04:27:12.950
GETS OLD ONLY GONNA BE WORKABLE

04:27:13.016 --> 04:27:14.084

NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH A

04:27:28.599 --> 04:27:29.433

04:44:16.038 --> 04:44:18.641
RANSOMWARE AND AT AS YOU KNOW

04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:21.611
THAT'S EXTREMELY BAD POLICY FOR

04:44:21.677 --> 04:44:23.780
ESPECIALLY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

04:44:23.846 --> 04:44:25.748
BECAUSE IT JUST ENCOURAGES THE-

04:44:25.815 --> 04:44:28.484
PACKERS TO CONTINUOUS SO I KNOW

04:44:28.551 --> 04:44:31.220
VENTURE DO THE THAT CYBER

04:44:31.287 --> 04:44:34.557
INSURANCE IS THAT THAT IS THAT.

04:44:34.624 --> 04:44:35.758
IT'S GOING TO MATURE I JUST

04:44:35.825 --> 04:44:38.428
DON'T THINK IT'S A RIGHT NOW

04:44:38.494 --> 04:44:39.195
AND I THINK THIS COULD BE

04:44:39.262 --> 04:44:41.631
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SO- I'M GONNA

04:44:41.697 --> 04:44:46.202
BE LAYING ON BILL TODAY.

04:44:46.269 --> 04:44:49.539
SOMEONE WILL ROOMS IN. THANK

04:44:49.605 --> 04:44:51.307
YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR UP MR

04:44:51.374 --> 04:44:52.375
CHOW WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE

04:44:52.442 --> 04:44:54.677
OPPORTUNITY TO A REACTS TO A

04:44:54.744 --> 04:44:56.913
CAL CHAMBERS QUESTION ABOUT THE

04:44:56.979 --> 04:45:00.316
METHODOLOGY BY WHICH A-

04:45:00.383 --> 04:45:02.285
CONTRACTING AGENCY WOULD GO

04:45:02.351 --> 04:45:04.153
ABOUT CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF

04:45:04.220 --> 04:45:06.689
REQUIRED INSURANCE GIVEN THE

04:45:06.756 --> 04:45:07.423
BROAD LANGUAGE OF THE BILL THAT

04:45:07.490 --> 04:45:09.992
SAYS. A SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL

04:45:10.059 --> 04:45:12.295
LOSSES RESULTING FROM POTENTIAL

04:45:12.361 --> 04:45:16.032
UNLAWFUL ACCESS. HI YES OF AT

04:45:16.098 --> 04:45:16.966
THIS POINT WE DON'T WANT THE

04:45:17.033 --> 04:45:18.835
LANGUAGE TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE

04:45:18.901 --> 04:45:21.404
AND I THINK- IT IS PRUDENT FOR

04:45:21.471 --> 04:45:23.172
US TO ALLOW THAT DECISION TO BE

04:45:23.239 --> 04:45:25.775
MADE- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- AT

04:45:25.842 --> 04:45:27.977
THIS AGENCY LEVEL- SO THAT

04:45:28.044 --> 04:45:29.779
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S- WHAT

04:45:29.846 --> 04:45:31.180
INFORMATION IS BEING COVER

04:45:31.247 --> 04:45:32.849
WHAT- BUT THE CALL YOU KNOW

04:45:32.915 --> 04:45:35.918
THE- POLICY OUGHT TO BE SO- I

04:45:35.985 --> 04:45:39.355
THINK THAT- THE DECISION IS TO

04:45:39.422 --> 04:45:41.224
ALLOW THE AGENCIES TO THIS

04:45:41.290 --> 04:45:44.694
QUESTION- TO DETERMINE EXACTLY

04:45:44.760 --> 04:45:46.762
HOW MUCH ARE THE POLICY OUGHT

04:45:46.829 --> 04:45:48.397
TO BE AND ALSO WHAT INFORMATION

04:45:48.464 --> 04:45:50.399
IS BEING COVER- OF HEAVY SAID

04:45:50.466 --> 04:45:54.370
THAT I THINK. D. ARE YOU KNOW

04:45:54.437 --> 04:45:55.838
WE'RE DEFINITELY FLEXIBLE AND

04:45:55.905 --> 04:45:58.708
OPEN TO- TAKING A LANGUAGE- ARE

04:45:58.774 --> 04:46:00.943
GOING FORWARD I KNOW THAT- YOU

04:46:01.010 --> 04:46:02.912
KNOW THERE'S BEEN A CURFEW

04:46:02.979 --> 04:46:05.248
OTHER ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED

04:46:05.314 --> 04:46:11.320
THOUGHT WHICH I DEEM TO BE R.

04:46:11.387 --> 04:46:14.023
M. AS- AND- NOT BEING. AS FOR

04:46:14.090 --> 04:46:16.392
AS THE- THIS WILL I THINK WE

04:46:16.459 --> 04:46:17.026
CAN ALSO TAKE DOES WELL BECAUSE

04:46:17.093 --> 04:46:18.294
SOME TO NOT REALLY DEAL WITH

04:46:18.361 --> 04:46:19.195
PERSONAL INFORMATION IT'S A

04:46:19.262 --> 04:46:21.564
LIBRARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT-

04:46:21.631 --> 04:46:24.934
AND ALSO THE- TO PUT IT IF

04:46:25.001 --> 04:46:27.570
NATURE OF- LET'S SEE. WHAT'S

04:46:27.637 --> 04:46:28.137
REQUIRED UNDER THIS LAW AND

04:46:28.204 --> 04:46:30.740
EXISTING POLICIES SO I

04:46:30.806 --> 04:46:32.742
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT. FULL TO

04:46:32.808 --> 04:46:35.611
PAY EXTRA REDUNDANT POLICY OF-

04:46:35.678 --> 04:46:38.180
SO I THINK THAT CAN BE- THAT

04:46:38.247 --> 04:46:40.449
CAN BE MODIFIED AS WELL- AS

04:46:40.516 --> 04:46:42.618
WELL AS THE OTHER OTHER ISSUES

04:46:42.685 --> 04:46:44.587
THAT DOESN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP-

04:46:44.654 --> 04:46:46.622
SO YEAH SO I TOTALLY.

04:46:46.689 --> 04:46:48.524
UNDERSTAND IT AND THE CONCERN

04:46:48.591 --> 04:46:50.760
RAISED AND- UNFORTUNATELY WE

04:46:50.826 --> 04:46:52.161
DON'T HAVE TIME TO REALLY LOOK

04:46:52.228 --> 04:46:54.030
INTO THE ISSUE. ALL WHEN THIS

04:46:54.096 --> 04:46:55.498
ISSUE SURFACE SO I COULD JUST

04:46:55.565 --> 04:46:57.066
HAVE A COUPLE DAYS AGO. SO YOU

04:46:57.133 --> 04:46:58.000
KNOW THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I'LL

04:46:58.067 --> 04:46:59.869
BE VERY HAPPY TO LOOK LOOK INTO

04:46:59.936 --> 04:47:01.804
AND ALSO TRY TO FIX THANK YOU I

04:47:01.871 --> 04:47:03.306
SHARE THAT CONCERN WITH THE

04:47:03.372 --> 04:47:03.839
BROADNESS OF THE LANGUAGE

04:47:03.906 --> 04:47:05.708
BECAUSE- A JUST PLAIN READING

04:47:05.775 --> 04:47:07.310
OF THE BILL WHEN IT SAYS.

04:47:07.376 --> 04:47:10.179
SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL LOSSES

04:47:10.246 --> 04:47:12.448
WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD

04:47:12.515 --> 04:47:14.884
TAKE AN EXTREME VIEW POINT OF.

04:47:14.951 --> 04:47:16.485
THE VERY MAXIMUM OF THE

04:47:16.552 --> 04:47:18.621
POTENTIAL LOSS WHEREAS OTHER

04:47:18.688 --> 04:47:20.022
CUT FORMS OF INSURANCE THAT'S

04:47:20.089 --> 04:47:22.091
NOT THE WAY THAT IT'S DONE. AT

04:47:22.158 --> 04:47:23.559
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR

04:47:23.626 --> 04:47:24.694
EXAMPLE REQUIRES DRIVERS TO

04:47:24.760 --> 04:47:27.296
HAVE LIABILITY INTO. BUT I

04:47:27.363 --> 04:47:28.898
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE WERE A

04:47:28.965 --> 04:47:30.900
COUPLE COVER. ATTENTION AND SO

04:47:30.967 --> 04:47:32.435
MAYBE YOU COULD SUBSTITUTE.

04:47:32.501 --> 04:47:34.437
SAYS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT

04:47:34.503 --> 04:47:36.305
IT AS YOU SAY. GIVING THE

04:47:36.372 --> 04:47:38.874
CONTRACTING AGENCY THE ABILITY

04:47:38.941 --> 04:47:40.376
TO DETERMINE A REASONABLE

04:47:40.443 --> 04:47:42.511
AMOUNT BUT NOT PRESCRIBING THEM

04:47:42.578 --> 04:47:45.881
TO HAVE TO COVER THE MAXIMUM

04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:47.416
AMOUNT. I'LL QUESTION ABOUT

04:47:47.483 --> 04:47:48.618
COMPANIES ABILITY TO SELF

04:47:48.684 --> 04:47:49.952
INSURE BECAUSE TYPICALLY WHEN

04:47:50.019 --> 04:47:51.120
WE IMPOSE A REQUIREMENT ON

04:47:51.187 --> 04:47:53.089
COMPANIES WE DO ALLOW THEM. TO

04:47:53.155 --> 04:47:54.056
CERTIFY THAT THEY HAVE THE

04:47:54.123 --> 04:47:56.359
ASSETS NECESSARY. TO COVER A

04:47:56.425 --> 04:47:58.361
LOSS AND IF THAT'S THE CASE BUT

04:47:58.427 --> 04:48:00.863
WE DON'T REQUIRE THEM TO BUY A

04:48:00.930 --> 04:48:02.465
COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. AND I

04:48:02.531 --> 04:48:04.100
DIDN'T SEE THAT- THAT KIND OF

04:48:04.166 --> 04:48:05.768
LANGUAGE IN YOUR BILL AND I WAS

04:48:05.835 --> 04:48:06.402
WONDERING WHAT YOU'RE THINKING

04:48:06.469 --> 04:48:08.471
ABOUT IT. YEAH HI- I'M FAMILIAR

04:48:08.537 --> 04:48:09.772
WITH THAT ALSO BECAUSE WHEN I

04:48:09.839 --> 04:48:11.273
SERVED ON A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD

04:48:11.340 --> 04:48:13.042
I. WE DID EXACTLY THAT WE SELF

04:48:13.109 --> 04:48:15.411
INSURED AND TO A CERTAIN LIMIT

04:48:15.478 --> 04:48:17.647
AND ANYTHING BEYOND THAT WOULD

04:48:17.713 --> 04:48:18.347
BE COVERED BY IT YOU KNOW I

04:48:18.414 --> 04:48:20.149
POLICY. SO THAT'S SOMETHING

04:48:20.216 --> 04:48:23.719
THAT WE ALSO LOOK INTO AYE AYE

04:48:23.786 --> 04:48:25.287
I THINK- WE HAVEN'T HAD A

04:48:25.354 --> 04:48:27.957
CHANCE. TO SEE LET'S SEE. I

04:48:28.024 --> 04:48:29.592
INDUSTRY FIRST OR- ANYBODY.

04:48:29.659 --> 04:48:30.226
NOBODY HAS ACT COME UP WITH ANY

04:48:30.292 --> 04:48:31.560
SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL

04:48:31.627 --> 04:48:33.763
UNTIL RECENTLY SO. SO THIS IS

04:48:33.829 --> 04:48:35.431
SOMETHING AND OTHER EVERY THAT

04:48:35.498 --> 04:48:36.832
WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO LOOK INTO

04:48:36.899 --> 04:48:38.534
AS WELL. I'VE SELF INSURANCE

04:48:38.601 --> 04:48:41.070
AND OTHER OTHER POTENTIAL HERE

04:48:41.137 --> 04:48:42.004
IS THAT WE SHOULD TOUCH ON.

04:48:42.071 --> 04:48:44.106
pTHAT WOULD STILL ACCOMPLISH

04:48:44.173 --> 04:48:45.741

COMPANIES CAN SURVIVE. AND ALSO

04:48:49.645 --> 04:48:50.880
THE CLAIMS GET PAID IF YOU HAVE

THAT- THAT KIND OF

04:48:54.950 --> 04:48:55.951
