THREE SIXTY FOUR. IS IN EFFECT

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.624
A VERY SIMPLE CONCEPT AND THAT

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.926
IS THAT WE PROVIDE FREE

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:56.262
EDUCATION NOW THAT IS OUR

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:59.065
POLICY SO EVERY CHILD AT EVERY

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.667
K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENT

CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO ATTEND A

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:05.004
PUBLIC SCHOOL FREE OF CHARGE.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:08.374
WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN THAT ARE

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.710
FED NUTRITIOUS MEALS I'M NOT

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.679
HUNGRY DO MUCH BETTER IN CHOOL

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.080
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE CAN BE

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.682
A VARIETY OF REASONS WHY A

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.617
CHILD MAY SHOW UP AT SCHOOL.

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.519
NOT HAVING YET BEEN FED AND

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.254
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THOSE

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.258
CHILDREN WHOSE FAMILIES ARE-

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:26.526
HAVE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS OR

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:27.727
OTHERS MAY FALL INTO THAT

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:28.995
CIRCUMSTANCE MORE THAN OTHER

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.596
CHILDREN BUT ANY CHILD COULD BE

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.298
IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY-

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.766
ARRIVE AT SCHOOL. AND HAVEN'T

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.768
BEEN ADEQUATELY FED AND THUS

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.171
ARE NOT AS ABLE TO PERFORM WELL

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:41.574
AT SCHOOL. SO WHAT SB THREE

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.710
SIXTY FOUR DOES IS IN THE SAME

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.178
WAY THAT WE PROVIDE FREE

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.280
SCHOOL. IT ENSURES THAT OUR

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:49.148
CHILDREN ARE FED A FREE MEAL.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:51.417
NOW THE BENEFIT OF THAT BESIDES

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.019
THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.088
MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES AT SCHOOL

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.924
IS THAT WE REMOVE THE STIGMA.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.426
FROM THOSE CHILDREN WHO WE DO

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.128

OTHER CHILDREN ONLY PAY A

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.337
PARTIAL COST. BUT FOR MANY

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.572
CHILDREN THERE'S A STIGMA TO

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:13.539
THAT WE ALSO HAVE A

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.174

ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.207
PEOPLE SIGNED UP. THERE WAS SO

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:52.376
MUCH EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE STATE

WIDE ROLL OUT IN JUNE AND YOU

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:55.646
MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT BREAKING

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.548
DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT SELF

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.417
ADVOCATES AND FAMILIES HAVE

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:04.689
FACED. I WAS SELECTED TO GO

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.023
INTO THE SELF DETERMINATION

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.226
PROGRAM IN NOVEMBER TWO

00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:09.894
THOUSAND NINETEEN BUT IT'S BEEN

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:11.329
VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:14.432
STARTED. FROM THE BEGINNING BY

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:15.733
REGIONAL CENTER HAS NOT BEEN

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.603

EMAIL SAYING THE PROGRAM IS NOT

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.411
RIGHT FOR ME. A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:29.180
ARE BEING TOLD BY REGIONAL

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:31.182
CENTERS THAT SELF DETERMINATION

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:33.851
IS TOO HARD. HE HEARD THIS

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.654
REPEATEDLY AT THE CONFERENCE

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:37.221
PARTICULARLY FROM PEOPLE OF

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:42.393
COLOR. PEOPLE WANT TO GO INTO

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.463
THE STP BUT THE BARRIERS ARE SO

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:48.299
CLEAR AND PROFOUND. IF YOU ASK

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:49.800
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE'LL

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.702
HEAR CONSISTENT THEMES ABOUT

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.738
THE PROBLEMS WE FACE BECAUSE OF

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.272
REGIONAL CENTER RESISTANCE I

00:37:55.339 --> 00:38:03.714
BUCKLE. THERE IS A REPORT FROM

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:04.649
THE STATE WIDE SELF

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.217
DETERMINATION ADVISORY

00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:08.119
COMMITTEE THAT REALLY GOES INTO

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:10.121
DETAIL WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:11.889
MOST OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:16.394
IMPLEMENTED. LET ME GIVE YOU A

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.029
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:20.531
BARRIERS. THE FIRST IS THAT IT

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:24.035
HAS TAKEN SO DARN LONG FOR GPS

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:26.370
TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. WE

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:28.706
ARE ALMOST AT EIGHT YEARS. IT

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:30.174
REALLY LOST MOMENTUM FOR THE

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:35.112
PROGRAM. BUT THE ENERGY HAS

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.648
RETURNED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:42.019
STATE WIDE ROLL OUT IN JUNE.

00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:44.121
ANOTHER MAJOR BARRIER FACT

00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:46.323
WHILE PARTICIPANTS AND FAMILIES

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.059
HAVE TO GO TO AN OVERLY

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.694
COMPLICATED ORIENTATION

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.229
REGIONAL CENTER STAFF ARE NOT

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:54.265
REQUIRED TO HAVE ANY TRAINING.

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:55.900
WE HEAR THAT MANY SERVICE CO

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.668
ORDINATORS DON'T INTERSTELLAR

00:38:57.735 --> 00:39:01.138
IN THE PROGRAM KEEPING THEIR

00:39:01.205 --> 00:39:06.210
CLIENTS FROM MOVING FORWARD. SB

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:07.011
FIVE ONE EIGHT WILL REMEDY THAT

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:09.380
SITUATION BY REQUIRING ONLY

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:10.815
GENERAL CENTER STAFF GET

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.650
TRAINING ON THE SELF

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:14.885
DETERMINATION PROGRAM. THE BILL

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:17.288
ALSO REQUIRES REGIONAL CENTERS

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:19.557
TO INFORM ALL OF THEIR CLIENTS

00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:26.297
ABOUT THE PROGRAM. SB FIVE ONE

00:39:26.363 --> 00:39:28.099
EIGHT DOES MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.567
IT CREATES THE OFFICE OF THE

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.368
OMBUDSPERSON FOR THE SELF

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:33.337
DETERMINATION PROGRAM WHO WOULD

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:35.573
INVESTIGATE THE BARRIERS WE ARE

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:37.908
FACING AND HELP US TO OVERCOME

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:40.177
THAT. BEYOND BUDGET PERSON WILL

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:41.879
BE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:46.283
THE PROGRAM. WE ARE HOPING THAT

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.820
SB FIVE ONE EIGHT AS IT MOVES

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.188
THROUGH THE SENATE WILL ENSURE

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:52.389
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:54.358
OMBUDSPERSON OFFICE AND

00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:55.493
CONTAINER DIVISIONAL

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.261
PROVISIONS. SUCH AS ADDING

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:59.497
CLEAR TIMELINES FOR REGIONAL

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:03.100
CENTERS. IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:06.537
ROAD. BUT AS WITH OTHER CIVIL

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:09.006
RIGHTS MOVEMENT FREEDOM IS

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:11.342
ALWAYS WORTH IT. I DON'T SEE

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.277
THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.012
WAS JUST A DIFFERENT WAY TO

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:17.681
RECEIVE SERVICES. I SEE HAVING

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:19.717
CHOICE AND CONTROL OVER ONE'S

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:21.719
LIFE AS A BASIC CIVIL AND HUMAN

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:28.592
RIGHT. THAT IS WHY WE NEED THE

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:30.661
SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM TO

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:34.398
SUCCEED AND SB FIVE ONE EIGHT

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:37.268

02:12:45.691 --> 02:12:47.492
OTHER LEGISLATION SUCH AS WE

02:12:47.559 --> 02:12:49.061
OUR AND CALIFORNIA BLUEGRASS

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:56.168
DIMINISH THOSE THAT NUMBER DOWN

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:25.630
POTENTIAL OF A PLAN OR ITS

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:27.599
REPLACEMENT. WHAT IF SOMEBODY

02:13:27.666 --> 02:13:28.900
SAID THAT WE SHOULD PASS A LAW

02:13:28.967 --> 02:13:30.635
THAT. THAT DISMANTLE YOUR JOB
