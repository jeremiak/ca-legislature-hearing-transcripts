GO AHEAD PLEASE PERCENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JR WHITE HOUSE HE MIGHT AUDIO WAS OKAY IT IS. BUT- EDITORS- MCCARTY SENATORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH TRUE BONE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION THIS ITEM IS ABOUT THE CDC'S PRIMARY FUNDING ACCOUNT- BY THE ENERGY RESOURCES PRO COUNTY WHICH IS IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. ARE YOU SOME OF YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS LAST YEAR. THE REASON IS DEMAND FOR THE SERVICES OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION OF INCREASING STEADILY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS INDEED IN THE LAST DECADE. THE LEGISLATURE STATUS- APPROVED. OVER SEVENTY NEW POSITIONS FUNDED BY- AND WE'RE ORGANIZATION ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE SIMULTANEOUSLY THE OPRAH REVENUES THAT WE RELY ON AS ONE OF OUR SHE FUNDING SOURCES BY FAR OUR LARGEST HAVE BEEN DECLINING. AND WE'D TO CHARACTERIZE THIS AS ARE BEING VICTIMS OF OUR OWN SUCCESS BECAUSE THIS URBAN DECLINE IS CHIEFLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO TWO FACTORS THE FIRST IS BEHIND THE METER- GROWTH- SOLAR IS CHIEF AMONG THE RESOURCES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. AND WE'RE UP TO TODAY ABOUT TWELVE GIGAWATTS OF ROOF TOP SOLAR WHICH IS A REALLY REMARKABLE DEVELOP. SECOND BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS- SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER ON A PER CAPITA BASIS THAN OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF. IN TERMS OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION BUILDING CODES AND THE CLIENT CODES THAT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION ADOPTS SO WHEN WE- RATCHET DOWN THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT CAN BE CONSUMED BY BUILDINGS THAT THEN DEPRESSES THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE USE WHICH IS GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA GREAT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IT IT DOES IMPACT OUR REVENUES SIMILARLY IN THE APPLIANCES I. JUST GIVING EXAMPLE TELEVISIONS FROM YEARS AGO WERE IN A FINANCIAL WE IMPOSED REQUIREMENTS ON INDUSTRY TO. DECREASE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION FROM THOSE DEVICES AND THE SAVINGS REMARKABLE EACH TV WE ESTIMATED WOULD SAVE CONSUMERS FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS PER YEAR AND REDUCE ENERGY EXPENDITURES AND WE HAVE SPENT ON A TEN YEAR LIFESPAN FOR TELEVISION SO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN SAVINGS WHICH FAR OUTSTRIPS THE VERY MARGINAL COST ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PUTTING THINGS INTO DEVICES THAT REDUCE THE ENERGY THAT THEY- YOUR- THE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION AND THIS IS WHAT HAS LED TO OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. WOULD HAVE KEPT US AFLOAT IS THAT WE'VE HAD IN OUR BALANCE THAT WE'VE BEEN USING AS THERE'S A DELTA BETWEEN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATE WHAT WE STAND AND THEN WHAT WE BRING IN TRUE- BUT- THEY SPEND DIFFERENT HEATING IS GOING FOR A WHILE. IN ADDITION WE'VE BEEN VERY FRUGAL THE LAST SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES WE HAVE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF- PRESS ON- BUT BY THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. OF THAT ABOUT TWENTY IS FROM FUNDS- FUND SHIFTED TO OTHER ACCOUNTS AND SIXTEEN POINT THREE MILLION IS FROM ACTUAL CITIES WOULD JUST MADE CUTS AND I'LL GIVE YOU. A QUICK EXAMPLE WE MOVED TO A NEW BUILDING AND SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE OUR FOOTPRINT AS A CONSEQUENCE WE ARE SAVING. OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN RENT. A SECOND. ISSUE I'VE SITE IS SOON AFTER THE PANDEMIC HIT IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY WE DECIDED IT MADE SENSE TO ELIMINATE OUR LANDLINE. WE ARE STAFFED WITH FLIP PHONES INEXPENSIVELY PHONES ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE PLANS THAT IS SAVING US OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR AN AGENCY OF. ABOUT REAL. QUICKLY- I'M A YOU HAVE ON YOUR THE SAN. WE WANT JUST I WANT TO GO THROUGH VERY BRIEFLY WHAT ARE PROPOSAL IS IN THE BUDGET. IT WOULD WE WOULD DO THREE THINGS THE FIRST IS TO EXTEND THE- SURCHARGE TO. BEHIND THE METER CONSUMPTION AS NOTED EARLIER THIS THE ONLY THE ONLY- CONSUMPTION THAT THE CHARGES APPLIED AGAINST IS THAT WHICH IS NEATER. IF WE EXTENDED TO BY THE METER TYPICALLY SOLAR THAT WILL GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE. AND- BRING BRING THEM IN LINE WITH EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S WHO'S BEEN PAYING THAT CHARGE BY THE WAY THE AMOUNT. ON AVERAGE PER RATEPAYER IS EIGHTEEN CENTS. PER MONTH THAT'S HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO FUND THE ENERGY COMMISSION TROOP- BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE A VERY LARGE ENERGY CONSUMER IT CAN COST MORE THAN THAT BUT- BRIDGES EIGHT. CENTS PER MONTH PER. METER SECOND PART THE PROPOSAL IS TO RAISE THE STATUTORY CAPSULE RIGHT NOW THE STE THE STATUTE CAPS THE SURCHARGE EIGHT POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO THREE- CENTS PER. KILOWATT HOUR OR THREE TENTHS OF ONE MILL WE WOULD PROPOSE TO RAISE THAT CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORT THE SENATE REQUESTED FROM THE SENATE OFFICE OFFICE OF RESEARCH TWO POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO FIVE FIVE. WHICH THE REPORT NOTED WOULD BE ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD BE IF WE HAD INDEXED THIS ONE TO INFLATION- WHEN ENERGY COMMISSION. RESET RIGHT NOW WE ONLY CAN INCREASE AT THAT WOULD INCREASE THE CAP. THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS TO MAKE AN ACTUAL INCREASE TO THE RATE AND WE HAVE TO DO IT A PUBLICLY NOTICED MEANING AND IT'S ONLY ALLOWED- IN IN THE IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER SO WE WOULD WE'VE DONE THAT A COUPLE TIMES OVER THE YEARS. THAT WOULD BE THE MECHANISM TO DO THAT AND- AND ANALLY WE WOULD TIE THE STATURE CAP TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX SO WE DIDN'T. IT TO INFLATION. IN CLOSING WE JUST SAY THAT WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN ACTUAL INVESTMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS. HE IT EIGHTEEN CENTS PER MONTH THE SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILDING STANDARDS AND THE APPLIANCE STANDARDS AND EVERYBODY'S GOT CHARGERS. COMPUTERS COMMITTEE. WE RETURN TO THE RAY PAYERS WHO FUND US MORE THAN THEY PAY MORE MORE THAN A PACK SO WE BELIEVE THAT MAKES OUR INVESTMENT SOUND WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OF COURSE I WILL BUY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER BROWN WITH THE L. A. SHOULD WE- GET RID OF ALL THE LAND LINES OVER AT THE L. LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE TO GIVE YOU A FLIP PHONE AND SAVE SOME. I NOT SURE A COMMENT ON PARTICULAR FOLDER RIGHT NOW WILL BIBLE. I SO BUT WE DO HAVE SOME ON THE- THE PER ON THE ISSUE OF THAT DIRECTOR BOW HAND TALK ABOUT JUST NOW- SOMEONE RUN THROUGH THAT QUICK I THINK FOR OFF. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE DO A THAT THERE CURRENTLY IS A- ANNUAL DEATH IN THE FUN IN THAT LEGISLATIVE ACTION BE NEEDED TO PREVENT INSOLVENCY SOMETIME IN THE COMING YEARS- HOWEVER WE DO THINK. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT FACTORS THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING JUST THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM AND WHEN ACTION IS NEEDED- ONE OF THEM SHORT TERM AND ONE OF THEM MORE LONG TERM. SO I'M NOT SHORT TERM SIDE- THE WE WANTED TO KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS THAT THE FUND WON'T GO INSOLVENT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S A FEW YEARS NOW SO AS RESULTS. IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADDRESS THAT THE DEFICIT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY- THIS YEAR. IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS NOT YET PROVIDED A DETAILED KIND OF FIVE YEAR OR A PROJECTION OF THE FUND CONDITION- FIRST SORT OF A FEW YEARS THE ON THE BUDGET YEAR. OTHER AS A RESULT THERE CONTINUES TO BE SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT. WHEN THE FIND EXACTLY WHAT WOULD GO INSOLVENT- I'M MORE OF THAT OF LONG TERM- ISSUES AND KIND OF CONDITION OF THE FUNDS. THE OTHER ISSUE I WANTED FLAG IS- AVENUES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW I'M GOING FORWARD EVEN BUYING A BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND BOTH ARE GOING TO MAKE CASE AND HIGH CASE SCENARIOS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A TWENTY ONE THAT SORT OF. YOU KNOW SHOWS SOME OF THOSE. PROJECTIONS IN SORT OF THE GROWTH OF SALES GOING FORWARD THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO. A STATE EFFORTS AROUND ELECTRIFICATION OF TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDINGS WHICH IS- TALK ABOUT OF COURSE IN PREVIOUSHEARINGS- AND SO AS A RESULT EVEN KIND OF GETTING OUT SOME OF THE ROADS AND- DISTRIBUTE GENERATION- THE GROWTH IN KIND OF. A RETAIL SALES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW GOING FORWARD SO THE DEGREE TO WHICH- A LONG TERM INCREASE IN THE SURCHARGE RATE IS NEEDED IS ALSO A BIT UNCLEAR AS REVENUE. FROM INCREASING SALES COULD AT LEAST PARTIALLY. ELIMINATE THE FUNDS I DEFICIT. SO WITHOUT THOSE KIND OF PIECES IN CONTEXT IN MIND WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME DIFFERENT OPTIONS IT COULD CONSIDER HERE- FIRST YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER REJECTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS THIS YEAR THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR. BUT IT OPS ARE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES ADMINISTRATION. DATE ON THE- NEXT YEAR INCLUDING. THE PROJECT OF THE LONG. REVENUE IN CAR. AND THIS COULD BE TO AND- YEARS A LOT. ADOPTED TYPE OF REQUIREMENT ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE K. TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE CONDITION OF THE FUNDING TAKE TAKE ACTION AS NECESSARY. ALTERNATIVELY ALTERNATIVELY IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MAKE CHANGES AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET COULD YOU CONSIDER ADOPTING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT REJECTING OTHERS SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN OUR VIEW EXTENDING THE SURCHARGE TO BEHIND THE METER CONSUMPTION COULD HELP ENSURE. REVENUES COLLECTED MORE EQUITABLY ACROSS ALL ENERGY CONSUMERS AND SO WE THINK. ALSO CANADA AS ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL THINK CHINA SURCHARGE TO INFLATION IS A REASONABLE STRATEGY TO ENSURE. FUTURE REVENUES SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR GROWTH SPENDING- BASELINE COST LIKE BROKEN SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR CDC STAFF. AND BOTH OF THESE CASES BUT THE BEHIND THE METER AND THAT TRYING TO INFLATION WE THINK THERE'SA CLEAR POLICY IN FISCAL RATIONALE FOR MAKING THOSE CHANGES- THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS THAT ROUTE REDUCE URBAN SPENDING SUCH AS- SHIFTING SOME OF THE COST IS ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION. IN COSTS RELATED TO THE EPIC PROGRAM WHICH COULD BE SHIFTED TO A DIFFERENT FUND AND- S. ARE A PART OF THE ISSUE- SO THERE ARE A- VARIETY OF OTHER. ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- SO JUST TO WRAP UP I GUESS OUR OVERALL COMMENTS WE DO THINK THERE ARE- OR SOME KIND OF A QUESTIONS ABOUT THE URGENCY NEEDED IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM- AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE A- HAS A FEW DIFFERENT- ALTERNATE. EXPLORE YOU KNOW. PACKAGE OR IN SOME FUTURE YEAR SO IN MY COMMENTS THERE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU QUOTE LET ME ASK YOU QUESTIONS BECAUSE I DIDN'T. REALIZED UNTIL IT CAME TO CHAIR HERE WHETHER MALE IS AND WHAT THE HUNDREDTH OF A MALE IS ON THE ELECTRICAL RATES BUT IS THE STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT YOU KNOW. ONCE UPON A TIME WE SET THE RATE AT A- ONE MILL AND THEN INTO TWENTY YEARS AGO WE GAVE THEM AUTHORITY TO GO TO. YOU KNOW TO BILLS OR TO THREE MALES RIGHT IN IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY YEARS WE'VE SEEN THAT. ADJUSTMENT THERE ARE. IF THEY DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE A DEFICIT OR REACHING DEFICIT TOLL TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IF WE GAVE THEM THE AUTHORITY. IS THAT YOU'RE THINKING THAT THEY WOULD ACT ON IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE TWICE OVER TWENTY YEAR PERIOD. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING IS IT'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN GIVING THEM THE AUTHORITY AND ACTUALLY RAISING RATES. RIGHT YEAH I MEAN OUR UNDERSTANDING AND I MEAN I THINK THIS IS- PROBABLY ALSO QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION ARE STANDING IS THAT THEY WOULD. NOT NECESSARILY- IMMEDIATELY INCREASE THE- THE SURCHARGE OF THIS WHAT KIND OF GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE SURCHARGE AS THEY SORT OF DEAN. IT'S NEEDED- GOING FORWARD AND SO- YOU'LL GET IN SOME OF THE OTHER. ASPECTS OF THIS TRIP- TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS SUCH AS KIND OF ADDING. BEHIND THE METER- CONSUMPTION TO IT THERE COULD BE IT COULD BE JUST SORT OF ADDING THAT CONSUMPTION ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND THEN THEY MIGHT NOT NEED TO LOOK AT INCREASING ACTUAL. SURCHARGE RATE UNTIL UNTIL A LATER DATE BUT YEAH DEMONSTRATION MORE. THERE ARE KIND OF GOING FORWARD IF WERE A PASS YEAH BECAUSE EVERY HAS THAT THE IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE- FISH RESPONSE. AS TO WHAT'S WE- BUDGET AND- PLUSES AND HAVING THAT THE WORDY TO DO THIS LONG RANGE PLANNING OUR- TRIP TO BOTTOM ARE. YOU WANT TO TAKE A- LOOK DOWN THAT ENERGY COMMISSION TEN YEAR PATHANS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE IF YOU GUYS HAD THIS AUTHORITY. WELL I CAN TELL YOU THIS WE ABSOLUTELY IT'S MY JOB TO BRING TO THE FIVE ENERGY COMMISSIONERS THE ISSUES- THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON IT THEY SEE TO VOTE ON WE WOULD NOT BE BRINGING. IN BUT CERTAINLY NOT THIS NOVEMBER IF WE'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO. HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST GRANTED- WE WOULD LOOK AT EACH YEAR AND SEE WHERE WE STAND AND THEN ONLY MAKE INCREASES IF WE NEED TO DO SO IF THE- INFLATION ADJUSTED WITH ENOUGH TO COVER IT IF THE BEHIND THE METER WAS ENOUGH TO COVER. MEMBERS CHANGE RATE SO WE CAN LOWER IT- AND AS I SAY IF YOU LOOK AT OUR FREE WE'VE BEEN QUITE EFFECTIVE AT IT- BEING BEING VERY FRUGAL. OKAY I'M THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD THE STAFF REPORT IS TO- KEEP THE MATTER ON HOLD WE MAY FOLLOW UP WITH A ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- AS THEY COME UP BUT I. THINK BOTH OF YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. AND I WILL MOVE TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY ONE. IN SUMMER RELIABILITY AND GENERATION AUDITS THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OVERSIGHT THIS IS ALSO SPRING FINANCE LETTER- P. U. C. GO AHEAD. YES GOOD AFTERNOON TERRA KASKI RACHEL PETERSON HERE WITH THE C. P. U. C.

AND WILL START WITH THE- GENERATION MONITORING AND- PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF REGULATION- POSITIONS THAT WERE REQUESTING- THESE ARE DEEPLY CONNECTED TO THE ONGOING CONDITIONS OF DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE AND CLIMATE CHANGE THAT CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCING. AND WE HOPE OUR SMALL SURGICAL EFFECTIVE PROPOSAL IS TO- PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE OVERALL PICTURE OF KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON OVER THE SUMMER. AND ENSURING THAT- PUBLIC SAFETY BAR SET UP STICKER WITH THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IMPACT ON CALIFORNIANS AND SO HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL IS OUR DIRECTOR OF SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT DIVISION LEE PALMER.

N. STREET THING CQC'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS INCREASING COMPLEXITIES OF BY YOU WHILE FAR OPERATIONS IN PS. PS COMPLIANCE OVERSIGHT. DURING THE SUMMER OF TWENTY. DUE TO WHITE BLACKOUTS FROM ELECTRIC SUPPLY SHORTAGES ON THE GRANT THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION FOR SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO EXPEDITE CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS AND RELIEVE DEMAND ON THE ELECTRIC GRID DURING EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. ADDITIONALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE ALWAYS HAVE EXPANDED INSTITUTIONALIZED THE USE OF PS PS. AS A WILDFIRE MITIGATION MEASURE AND CONDUCTED ON AVERAGE OF TWENTY THREE PS PS ABOUT PER YEAR. IN RESPONSE SB LAUNCHED ELECTRIC GENERATION MODERATE PROGRAM THE REQUIRED GENERATORS TO REPORT FORCED FOR UNPLANNED OUTAGES. THAT REAL TIME MONITORING AT TWELVE CRITICAL ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITIES. AND COORDINATE WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO ENSURE BLACKOUTS EXPERIENCED DURING THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY DID NOT REAR CURRENT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ADDITIONALLY THE CPC REVISED ITS GENERAL ORDER ONE SIXTY SEVEN B. TO PROVIDE GREATER ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OVER REGULATED GENERATION FACILITIES DROUGHT CONDITIONS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND DESPITE EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE DURATION OF THE VANCE PS PS OFFENSE MAY RATED MAY REMAIN A TOOL FOR THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO MITIGATE WHAT BARBAROUS. EDITION ONLY WITH INCREASED ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES GRANTED AND THE REVISED GENERAL ORDER ONE SIXTY SEVEN B. THIS REQUEST IS CRITICAL TO POSITION THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION WITH THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO CONDUCT PLAN AUDITS AT THAT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITIES. IN THE CQC'S JURISDICTION WHAT GOAL EVERY FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS BASED ON A TWENTY FOUR PROJECTED PLAN AUDITS FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE.

AND THE CAPACITY TO WORK TOWARDS PREVENTING ATTACKS LIKE THE MOSS LANDING BAD RESTORED OUTAGE AND ARIZONA BATTERY STORAGE FIRE. IT IS REQUEST FOR- STAFF AND RESOURCES IS APPROVED THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION WE BETTER POSITIONED TO PROVIDE PROACTIVE MONITORING OF GENERATION FACILITIES PRIOR TO THE SUMMER MONTHS. AND COULD HELP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INTERRUPTIONS TO ELECTRIC SUPPLY AND GENERATION FACILITIES DURING THE CRITICAL SUMMER MONTHS. TIME OF SUCH. FROM EXTREME WHY CONDITIONS YOU SEE IT ADDITIONALLY APPROVED THIS REQUEST WHAT EXPAND CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED COMPLEXITIES OF ELECTRIC UTILITY PS PS COMPLIANCE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER. MISTER CHAIRMAN I HOPE YOU FIND THIS HELPFUL OTHER FOR TO ADDRESSING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND THANK YOU AGAIN. I GUESS ONE THE QUESTIONS BEFORE I GET T. ELLIE- REPORT OR HOW MANY SAID YOU KNOW PART OF OUR RELIABILITY IS NECESSARILY ON IMPORTS THAT WE BRING INTO THE SYSTEM RIGHT THAT THAT THAT ENERGY THAT WE- HEAR.

WITH THE PEACE SEE WHETHER THE- PEOPLE HELP WITH THOSE IMPORTED SOURCES. WELL FROM WITH REGARDS TO THE IMPORTED SOURCES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN OUR OWN STATE IS PREPARED TO HANDLE WHAT IS EVER COMING IN. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEIR OWN INTERNAL GENERATING FACILITIES AREN'T MEETING THE MARK AND ARE OPERATING NOT ONLY TALK TO THEIR RELIABILITY STANDARDS BUT ALSO THEIR SAFETY STATE. NO NO I SORT OF I. GUESS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH JURORS EXTRA JURISDICTION IN UTAH OR IN WASHINGTON- BELIAU. YOUR COMMENTS ON THIS REQUEST. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERN WITH THIS ROSTER CARE.

I WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON HOW THE STAFF MEMBERS ARE GOING TO HOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE I'M ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF UNDERGROUNDING CELL AS WE KNOW IT IS IN UNFORTUNATELY CENTER DOLLY NIGHT TO PERSONALLY CALIFORNIANS HAVE LITERALLY RUN FOR THEIR LIVES WHETHER HOMES BURNED TO ESCAPE FROM UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES IN YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. I ESPECIALLY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. YOU NEED TO MILLION OF ERIC ACRES OFFOREST LAND IN BURN DOWN THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AND ALL THE WHILE U. S. SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC WHO HAVE UNDERGROUND OVER HALF OF THEIR LINES IN P. JEANNIE IS UNDERGROUND IN APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED. MILES A YEAR IF WE'RE LUCKY. I AND I APPRECIATE THE NEW CEO WHO HAS SAID THAT IT IS HER GOAL TO BE ABLE TO UNDERGROUND TEN THOUSAND MILES OF DISTRIBUTION LINES IN THE MOST HIGH FIRE THREAT ZONES BUT JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT. THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLI UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS HEARD THIS. OVER THE LAST FOUR CEO. AND NOW THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS HERE IN FRONT OF THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WANTING TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AND I AM PERPLEXED. ON WHY WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE ON HOLDING ELECTRIC UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR UNDERGROUNDING AND HARDENING OF LINES. AND IN FACT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GET THESE TEN THOUSAND MILES UNDERGROUND- IN THESE HIGH FIRE THREAT DOWN WE KNOW THAT THERE IS. A FINANCIAL PATH FOR TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT POTENTIALLY BINDING AGAINST WHAT THEY SPEND ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF ONE POINT THREE TO ONE POINT. SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ANNUALLY AND- AMORTIZE THAT OVER POTENTIALLY TWENTY YEARS VERY GOOD TO THE THIRTY SIX BILLION FORTY BILLION THAT NEEDED TO BE. TEN THOUSAND MILES OF LINE BUT I JUST SHARED MISTER CHAIR MY FRUSTRATION THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE UTILITY BECAUSE- ACTUALLY.

OURSELVES AND THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY SINCE THAT MOMENT SINCE THAT PRESS CONFERENCE THEY HAVE SINCE INCLUDED THE UNDERGROUNDING AS A STRATEGY IN THERE WHILE FOR MITIGATION PLAN WHICH IS UNDER REVIEW BY THE SAFETY AND THEN IN ADDITION HAVE PRESENTED IT TO US USING STANDARD ICAL OF THE RATE BEGINNING THAT PROPOSED IS NOW UNDER REVIEW BY BOTH OUR STAFF. AND THE NUMEROUS INTERVENORS WHO TYPICALLY PARTICIPATE IN A RAPE CASE. IF IT'S ALRIGHT TO MADAM EXECUTOR IN IN IN I KNOW YOU'RE INHERITING THIS ISSUE SO I AM GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU JUST SAID MANAGE OCCURRED ACTOR IN PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY POINT IT. IS FRUSTRATION WITH YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ARE COMING ON BOARD. THE THOMAS FIRE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH- SCORCHED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT R.

JEANNIE BECAUSE WAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE KING KATE FIRE PG&amp;E COP TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SIXTY FIRE PG&amp;E CLASSES IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I SAY ALL THAT IS WE HAVE KNOWN IT BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT JUST A P. AT P. C. ISSUE THE LEGISLATURE HAS JUST BEEN TO BE CANDID HAS NOT HAD BEEN AT. IT HOLD THIS UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE OF POLITICS AND IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING AND THE ONES THAT PAY THE PRICE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY.

WITH YOU AND LONG WITH THE LEGISLATURE. SO I WANT TO. HOW THESE NEW POSITIONS GOING TO HELP EXPERT. GETTING LINES UNDERGROUND. WELL SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THESE NEW POSITIONS ARE IN FACT INTENDED TO SURGICALLY ADDRESS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SET OF ISSUES I'M WE HAVE PROPOSED TO THESE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ALSO MONITORING AND REGULATING THE GENERATION FLEET INSIDE CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS- CONTINUALLY NARROWING DOWN AND REDUCING THE IMPACTS OF THE UTILITIES USE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS- SINCE THOSE ARE THE PROPOSALS ON THE AGENDA TODAY I DIDN'T BRING THE STAFF WHO ARE OVERSEEING AND- STAFFING THE GENERAL RATE CASE- I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU WITH THOSE STAFF THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT HOW THE GENERAL RATE CASE MIGHT GO. AND HE- BY P. WILL BE ANALYZE I WILL ONLY KNOW THE IT IS AN EXPENSE- WILDFIRE RISK MITIGATION TO. AND IN THE MORE TOPOGRAPHICALLY- AND CHALLENGING AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AS YOU WELL KNOW REPRESENTING THOSE DISTRICTS- IT'S JUST COMPLICATED TO UNDERGROUND LINES BUT NEVER THE LESS WE ARE TAKING THEIR PROPOSAL WITH ALL SERIOUSNESS AND VETTING IT AND STORE THE INTERVENERS IN THAT PROCEEDING I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER- MORE SPECIFIC FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS IN THIS WILL BE THE LAST OF SAVING MINIMUM EXACT VICTORY AGAIN PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY POINT QUITE. EIGHT I. THE NEW THE ROLE IN I KNOW THAT THE COMMITTED TO THIS I'LL END IT RIGHT HERE WITH THIS- I KNOW THAT I AM- ONE TRICK PONY ON THIS ISSUE. IT IS EXPENSIVE BUT LET ME TALK ABOUT WHAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE. IS BURNING DOWN. THEY'RE IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. WE'RE TALKING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES ACROSS THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO. HELP FOLKS REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND THEIR LIVES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A THIRTY SIX TO FORTY BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. BUT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION COULD PUT TOGETHER A LONG TERM FINANCIAL PLAN ON HOW THIS CAN BE- ADVANCED. FUNDED AND ULTIMATELY EXECUTED SO THAT. WE'RE IT WE KNOW THAT OUR COMMITTEES ARE TO BE SAFE 99% ACCORDING TO FIRE EXPERT INCLUDING UTILITIES IN SOUTH 99% OF ALL UTILITY COP WHILE IN FIRES. I CAN BE STOP BY GETTING THESE GROUNDS UNDER THESE LINES UNDERGROUND. IN ONE OF OUR COACHES IS NUMBER ONE LET'S GET FEDERAL FINES. FIVE BILLION IS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO HELP PAY FOR THESE UNDERGROUNDING NUMBER TWO. AND FANCYING I TELECOM TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO TEAM AND- SO- I LOOK THAT AS ANY DOWN SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE. AND YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR INTELLIGENCE. ARE YOU READY. THANK YOU CHAIR IN MADAME CIRCUIT THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT I HAVEN'T A GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT GENERATION- WORK WE'RE GOING TO BE- SOON SHUTTING DOWN- SAN LUIS OBISPO- DIAVEL CANYON- AND WE'RE IN A DROUGHT RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE ALSO- ABOUT THE PROJECTIONS OUT FOR ACTUALLY GENERATION AVAILABLE- FOR CALIFORNIANS DURING THIS- SHORTAGE. I SENATOR- NAY C. THANK YOU RACHEL PETERSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- THERE IS- A IT ACTUALLY- DIFFERENT TEAM WORKING ON RELIABILITY ISSUES AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE A FOLLOW UP- SET OF DOCUMENTS TO YOUR OFFICE- THERE IS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORKING ON AND- INSURING THAT THE LIGHT STATE ON OVER THE SUMMER. USING EVERY ELEMENT THAT WE ARE GENERATION FLEET FLEET PLUS A NUMBER OF CUSTOMER DRIVEN PROGRAMS JUSTIN INTEREST. IS A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES RIGHT I DON'T HAVE EXPERTS WHO- HAND HEY WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR AGENCIES THE CALIFORNIA ISO IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION ON THAT EFFORT AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE SOME FOLLOW UP INFORMATION. THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD HAVE THE REASON YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ELECTRIFYING- THIRTY MILLION CARS IN CALIFORNIA BY. THIRTY THIRTY FIVE AND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS- AT BEST RIGHT NOW WITH A MILLION- ELECTRIC DVDS ON THE ON THE ROADS OF CALIFORNIA- A NOT ABLE TO KEEP UP LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR ASKED US NOT TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE OUR CARS DURING THE DAY WHEN- WE WERE HAVING PSP TO SELL. DID YOU SEE WHAT THE LONG TERM- PLAN IS FOR A GENERATION AND FOR- THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR- MEETING THOSE GOALS THAT ARE BEEN LAWFULLY SET IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR A BILL DONE- MY COLLEAGUES- BOYNTON I I'D I GUESS I WOULD JUST. I WOULD ADOPT THE FRUSTRATION- AND SORT OF CONSISTENT OUTRAGE THAT EXISTS NOT JUST IN THE NORTH I WOULD SAY I APPRECIATE MY FRIEND FROM NORTH TALKING ABOUT THOMAS- WE'LL SEE. AND ALL THE OTHER CATASTROPHES WE'VE HAD- IN EDISON COUNTRY ON THIS FRONT I JUST. I WANT TO ALIGNED WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID ABOUT UNDERGROUNDING- AND SEE IF THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM THAT PUT PUBLIC SAFETY IS THE FIRST PRIORITY FOR RULE TWENTY IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE. AT LEAST UNDER EXISTING LAW CAN STILL SORT OF PURSUE THOSE PROJECTS JUST FOR AESTHETIC PURPOSES AS WELL. SO IS THE PC- AT LEAST HAVE ON THEIR OWN REGULATIONS THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK THAT PUTS. PUBLIC SAFETY IS SORT OF A WAY TO GET TO THE FRONT OF THAT LINE WHICH IS WAY TOO LONG OF A LINE ALREADY BUT- DO YOU DO NOW MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN AS WELL AND I LITTLE NOTE IS THAT- MODIFICATION AND CONSIDERATION OF THE ELEMENTS OF WILL TWENTY IS AN OPEN ACTIVE PROCEEDING AT THE CPUC AND SO I CAN'T ACTUALLY FORECAST THE OUTCOME TO THAT. WE ARE- THE WAY THEY OPERATE THAT WE DO RELY GOVERNMENTS TO COME FORWARD WITH PROJECTS NOW WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE CONSIDERING CRITERIA THAT- INCLUDE SAFETY I CAN'T ACTUALLY SAY BECAUSE I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE D. THE FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE OKAY. AND THEN- THE ON THE UNDERGROUNDING ISSUE I WANTED TO ASK. WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD TO PASS A FEW DIFFERENT BILLS OVER THE YEARS TO. TO TRY TO NUDGE YOU ALL AS WELL AS THE I. O. U.'S- TO PURSUE SOME OTHER TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT- ON MICRO GRIDS WE PASSED SB THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE YEARS AGO AND I. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SEE IS. STILL YET TO ADOPT- A TERROR FOR MICROGREENS. I KNOW THERE'S SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE BUT GIVE A STATUS UPDATE ON- MORE DEPLOYMENT OF MICRO GRIDS IN IN FIRE ZONES DO WE HAVE ANY DEPLOYED IN ALL OF. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TERRITORY OR- ANYWHERE ELSE. SO SENATOR- AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS IT'S NOT THE A TEAM OF EXPERTS THAT I BROUGHT WITH US TODAY WE ACTUALLY HAVE ADOPTED A MICRO GRIDS TERRACE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION IS SUBJECT TO- BOTH THE LOCALITY AND THE UTILITY BRINGING- PROJECTS FORWARD TO US PURSUANT TO THAT TERRORIST WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE AS FAR AS WHEN HE WHETHER ANY ARE PROPOSED OR- AND PERHAPS A MOVING TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TERRITORY I APOLOGIZE I JUST DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS MYSELF OKAY AND THEN LAST QUESTION- PASSED THE BILL. LAST YEAR SB FIVE THIRTY THREE- WHICH REQUIRES UTILITIES IN THEIR WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. TO ACTUALLY QUANTIFY AND IDENTIFY NOT JUST THE P. S. P. S. PRONE ZONES BUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE ON INDIVIDUALS ON MOST THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ON PEOPLE- SAY WITHOUT. BACKUP GENERATORS ON FIXED INCOME WHO ARE ON I. HSS VULNERABLE SENIORS- WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IN PAST WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. A DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT ON THE PC'S PLANS TO IMPLEMENT SB FIVE THIRTY THREE. WELL SENATOR THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING- WEBER MITIGATION PLANS UNDER THEIR GUIDELINES AND WITH AN ASSESSMENT ABOUT PERFORMANCE LIES WITH A DIFFERENT OFFICE NOW THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. I'M VERY HAPPY TO- PASS THAT RE QUERY ON TO DIRECTOR THOMAS JACOBS AND HER TEAM WITH A REQUEST TO GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ON THEIR ASSESSMENT- OF THAT IN THE W. MPS. SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER WFP'S ARE NOTING THE HUMAN IMPACTS OF PS PS YEAH.

WE ARE SUPPORTIVE WITH A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS. ONE IS THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH HOW THE NONPROFIT CLAIMS THAT THE LEAVE THERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED ON PROFIT CLAIMS BEYOND THE STATUTORY DEADLINE OF THIRTY FIVE DAYS. AND IS CREATING A MAJOR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS FOR INTERVENERS INCLUDING CHARTS TURN ALONE HAS MORE OUT ANY CLAIMS THAT IT'S ENTIRE ANNUAL BUDGET. FROM CRANE TWENTY BACK TWO YEARS WE BELIEVE THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE MORE SHOULD BE AT HAND. WE SHIFT THE STAFF. JUST WORKING THE BACKLOG NOW. OUR STUDENTS POSSIBLE WE WAIT FOR THE FEW MONTHS HIRE NEW STAFF- THE INITIAL STAFF MAY BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE NEW. AND HIGHER NUMBER OF CLAIMS BUT IT WILL NOT. TAKE A BIG CHUNK OUT OF THE BACK LOG IN A SHORT ENOUGH. TIME TO ALLOW LEADERS TO CONTINUE. TO PARTICIPATE REMEMBER INTERVENORS PAY OUT OF POCKET FROM DAY ONE OF THE PROCEEDING. UNTIL THE END OF THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH COULD BE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS AND HAVE TO CARRY THIS THAT- FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS WHY THE SEVENTY FIVE DAY DEADLINE. TO PROCESS THE CLAIM AND WILL CLAIMS BEING MONTHS AND YEARS PAST THE DEADLINE- IT IS TOO MUCH OF A FINANCIAL BURDEN WE OFFER MORE THAN SIX AND WE OUT FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION.
