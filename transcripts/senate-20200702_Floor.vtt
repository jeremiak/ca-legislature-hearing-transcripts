00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:17.283
THE NATION TO CREATE A PROGRAM

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.485
BY WHICH PEOPLE COULD. TAKE

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:22.955
LEAVE THAT WOULD BE PAID FOR.

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:25.124
THE PROGRAM REQUIRES THE

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:28.728
EMPLOYEE. TO PUT MONEY IN TO

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.963
THAT PROGRAM NOT THE EMPLOYER

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.599
SO WHEN YOU TAKE FAMILY LEAVE

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.968
YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY CALLING IN

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:37.770
THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT YOU

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:40.306
HAVE CREATED. WE HAVE NOW IN

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:43.075
CALIFORNIA'S SIX WEEKS OF

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.777
PARTIALLY PUT PAID WAY

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:47.580
REPLACEMENT IT WILL BE GOING UP

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.648
TO EIGHT WEEKS IN JANUARY. WELL

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.817
THAT'S GREAT BUT THE PROBLEM IS

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.687
THAT FOR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS.

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:57.256
CAN TAKE THAT LEAVE THAT THEY

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.292
HAVE AND GET REIMBURSED BOARD.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.228
GET PAID OUT OF THEIR OWN

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:04.263
SAVINGS ACCOUNT A PARTIAL WAGE

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.665
REPLACEMENT. BUT THERE IS NO

00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:08.667
ASSURANCE THAT THEIR JOB WILL

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:11.137
BE THERE WHEN THEY RETURN. WHAT

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:15.474
THIS BILL IS TODAY IS THE OTHER

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.676
HALF OF THAT EQUATION. THE HALF

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:18.911
OF THAT EQUATION THAT ASSURES

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:21.380
PEOPLE WHEN THEY TAKE THE LEAD

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.215
THEY ARE ENTITLED TO TAKE.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:24.316
THEIR JOB WILL BE THERE WHEN

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:25.985
THEY COME BACK. BECAUSE WHAT

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:27.920
HAPPENS IS PEOPLE DON'T TAKE

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.322
THE LEAVE BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.956
AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.259
JOB. THAT IS A HOBSON'S CHOICE

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:35.494
A SOPHIE'S CHOICE. EITHER YOU

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:37.530
TAKE BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.331
ENTITLED TO. OR YOU LOSE YOUR

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.634
JOB BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE THAT.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.637
THAT IS WRONG. THAT MAKES IT

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:46.705
DIFFICULT IF NOT POSSIBLE FOR

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:49.475
PEOPLE TO BE PAYMENT BEINGS. TO

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.043
HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WHETHER

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.944
THEY'RE GOING TO CARE FOR A

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:54.246
SICK FAMILY MEMBER OR THEIR OWN

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:56.549
HEALTH. OR HAVE A JOB WHEN

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:59.018
THEY'RE DONE. THAT'S JUST A

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:02.655
CRUEL AND INHUMAN. APPROACH TO

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:05.024
PEOPLE HAVING NEEDS TO CARE FOR

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.159
FAMILY BECAUSE WE ARE ALL HUMAN

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.829
BEINGS AND I WILL POSH AT THAT.

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.764
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE NOT YET

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.999
HAD THAT RESPONSIBILITY WILL AT

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.367
SOME POINT HAVE THAT

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.169
RESPONSIBILITY. TO CARE FOR

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:20.005
THEMSELVES. IF THEY BECOME ILL

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:22.441
OR TO CARE FOR A LOVED ONE OR

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:25.010
TO HAVE A FAMILY. AND BE ABLE

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.646
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN TO BE THERE

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:28.447
DURING THOSE CRITICALLY

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.649
IMPORTANT EARLY TIMES WHICH WE

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:33.385
KNOW BY THE WAY. ARE BENEFICIAL

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:36.188
NOT ONLY TO THE INFANT BUT ALSO

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.990
TO THE MOTHER REDUCES POST

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.792
PARTUM DEPRESSION BY A THIRD.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:43.462
IT ALSO CREATES A LIFETIME BOND

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:45.965
WITH A NEW FATHER. NOW 25% OF

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.234
THE PEOPLE TODAY. WHO HAVE NEW

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.469
CHECK A FAMILIES CAN'T ACCESS

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:53.939
THAT LEAVE. THIS BILL WILL

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:57.076
CORRECT THAT IT'S SIX TO CLOSE

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:58.611
THE CARE GIVING GAP THAT HIS

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:01.080
EXISTED FOR FAR TOO LONG

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:03.015
CREATING AN UNCONSCIONABLE

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:04.783
DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.819
TAKE THE TIME OFF BECAUSE THEY

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.687
WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER OF A

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:10.556
HIGHER NUMBER AND THOSE WHO

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.991
CAN'T SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WORK

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:13.359
FOR AN EMPLOYER OF A LESSER.

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.661
NUMBER THERE IS NO CONNECTION

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:17.129
BETWEEN THE NEED TO CARE FOR

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:19.165
FAMILY AND THE EMPLOYER THAT

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:22.868
YOU WORK FOR. WHY SHOULD THERE-BE THAT DISTINCTION THERE

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:26.338
SHOULD NOT. AND I BELIEVE IT IS

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:28.007
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO CLOSE

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:31.777
THAT GAP DURING THIS PANDEMIC.

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:34.380
AFTER ALL WE WANT THOSE TO STAY

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:36.148
HOME SO THEY DON'T INFECT

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.918

00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:31.103
YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA ENACTED

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.472

INTO THEIR PROGRAM. BUT FROM

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.919
THE BEGINNING AS I MENTIONED

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:48.254
FOR TWO WORKERS WERE EXCLUDED

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.322
FROM THOSE PROTECTIONS BECAUSE

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.857
THEY'RE BASED ON THE SIZE OF

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.209
THIS HAS FORCED THEIR TERRIBLE

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.844
CHOICE. RESEARCH TELLS US THE

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:20.252
AND OF COURSE THAT MAKES SENSE

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:21.387
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABLE TO STAY

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:24.023

PEOPLE CAN DO. HOW I HAD A JOB

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.962

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:38.263
QUITE REMARKABLE AND I WAS

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.266
QUITE FORTUNATE WITHOUT THAT I

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:41.833

WORK KNOWING THAT MY JOB WAS

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:41.760

NOW. WAS INSANITY. SO THIS IS A

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:52.104
VERY NEEDED POLICY. AND AS THE

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.940
DEBATE ON THE FLOOR- WHEN WE

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:56.141
LAST TOOK THIS UP. TALKED

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:59.244
ABOUT. WE ARE REALLY THE ONLY-

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:01.613
E. C. D. COUNTRIES. THE DOES

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.349
NOT HAVE SUCH A POLICY. UNITED

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:07.419
STATES THE ONLY. AND

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:09.354
UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THIS

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:11.490
AFFECTS EVERYONE MEN WOMEN ANY

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:15.494
GENDER. WHAT IS IT THE LACK OF

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.263
THIS POLICY HAS MOST IMPACTED

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.665
WOMEN'S ABILITY TO MOVE UP

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.601
ECONOMICALLY AND TO MOVE IN THE

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:25.771
WORK FORCE. AND THAT IS NOT

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:28.340
APPROPRIATE AT THIS POINT SO I

00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:29.875
REALLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:32.010
MEASURE BY VIRGIN AYE VOTE AND

RATIONAL. AND WORKABLE AND JOSS

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:04.543
PAID FAMILY LEAVE APPROACH

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:08.914
INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.549
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:13.151
THIS. OF PAID FAMILY AND

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:15.453
FOUNDER POLICY AROUND WORLD. IT

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.989
IS DEEPLY MORTIFYING THAT THE

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:19.925
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS SO

00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:23.128
FAR BEHIND OTHER NATIONS IN

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:25.030
MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD IN MANY

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:26.364
PARTS OF THE WORLD THIS IS NOT

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:28.533
CONTROVERSIAL. THIS IS NOT

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.668
SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:32.437
A FIGHT EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:36.141
IMPLEMENT. FAMILY LEAVE IT'S

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:39.277
CONSIDERED AS BASIC AS NORMAL

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:41.713
THAT OF COURSE WHEN SOMEONE HAS

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.849
A NEW CHILD OR HAS A SIX SPOUSE

00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:46.885

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:50.755
COURSE. YOU CAN STAY HOME AND

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.757
TAKE CARE OF THAT PERSON.

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:55.260
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.094
FRANKLY OF A SAFETY NET IN

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:58.930
GENERAL AND FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:00.532

CHILD OR SICK FAMILY MEMBERS

00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:05.637
AND THE IDEA THAT WE CONTINUE.

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:08.473
TO FORCE. SOMETHING LIKE FORTY

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.042

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:27.158
THAT WE ARE FORCING. ON

00:25:27.225 --> 00:25:29.628
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS

00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:31.396
EVERY SINGLE DAY AND LET'S BE

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:33.265
CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT WHO THOSE

00:25:33.331 --> 00:25:36.568
WORKERS ARE. IT'S NOT EQUALLY

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:40.238
SPREAD AMONG ALL WORKERS THIS

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:42.274
IS DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.276

COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THIS IS

00:25:57.355 --> 00:26:00.225
NOT EQUALLY SPREAD. AND WHAT WE

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:02.327
ARE ASKING IS TO HAVE MORE

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.295
EQUITY SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:05.263

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:55.119
INTERESTING THAT THE

LEGISLATURE. PASSES ALL KINDS

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:59.891
OF LAWS TO REGULATE MY BUSINESS

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:00.458
AND THEY DON'T EVEN ABIDE BY

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:03.795
THE LAWS. THE DAY PASS. THIS

00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:05.430

WHY DON'T WE DO IT LEASE ABIDE

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:16.708

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:18.743
ELSE HAS TO WE ARE RIGHT WE HAD

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:19.544

NO LABEL ON IT. THIS IN MY

00:31:48.773 --> 00:31:50.108

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:51.209
SOMETHING I COULD GET SUED OVER

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.935
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR EMPLOYEES.

ALLOWED HER THE TIME OFF NOT

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:47.872
BECAUSE THEY WERE MANDATED NOT

BECAUSE IT WAS THE LAW IT'S

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:50.808

TAKE CARE OF THE SCHOOL WOULD

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:08.859
SITUATION. BUT GOING BACK TO MY

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:09.894
COLLEAGUE AT BIEBER ABOUT THE

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:11.028
WAY THAT BUSINESSES PUNITIVE

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:13.064
KIND AND THEN THE EXPRESSIONS

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.499
FOR LABOR THAT COME ALONG- THE

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:18.069
EXCEPTIONS FOR THIS BUILDING-

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:20.171
MY COLLEAGUES SAYS YOU KNOW WHY

AREN'T WAYS THIS BUILDING AND

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:22.607
WHAT. BRINGS IT IN SEVENTY

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:24.675
THINGS THIS THING DOESN'T THE

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.677
CELLS IN THE LABOR LAWS THAT

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:27.778
ARE PASSED IN THIS THING

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:32.650
BECAUSE THIS BUILDING. FOR

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:33.684
COMPLY. WITH WHAT ON. IN THE

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:35.019
REAL WORLD IN THE BUSINESS

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.455
WORLD. AND THAT'S EVIDENT. WHEN

00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:38.889
THE SENATE PRO TEMPORE TOGETHER

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:39.991
WITH THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:43.494
UNIT. IN HAD. A JUST A STRUGGLE

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:45.463
SHE WORKS SO HARD TO MAKE SURE

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:46.931
THAT WOMEN IN THIS BUILDING AND

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:47.865
PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING HAD

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.468
OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE A PLACE.

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.069
I'M TO GO TO IN THERE WOULD NOT

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:53.638
BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:55.606
RETALIATED AGAINST OR FIRED.

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:58.142
AND LONG BEFORE SHE WORKED HARD

00:37:58.209 --> 00:37:59.744
TO MAKE THAT EQUAL WITH THE

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.212
BUSINESS COMMUNITY. PEOPLE

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:02.446
WOULD JUST GET FIRED IN THIS

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:03.648
BUILDING FOR FILING A COMPLAINT

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:06.484
AGAINST THEIR LEGISLATOR

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.585
ALMIGHTY LEGISLATOR EMPLOYER.

FIRE OR REPLACED OR MOVE TO A

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:11.522
DIFFERENT OFFICE IN THE REAL

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:13.391
WORLD THAT WAS ILLEGAL AND NOW

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:14.759
THE SENATE PROTEIN JUST

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:15.960
RECENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:17.995
YEARS. HAS THANKS TO MY

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:19.630
COLLEAGUE FROM AT LAKE ELSINORE

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.198
THE PAST A PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:22.133
AFTER TRYING TO GET THROUGH

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:23.567
THIS BUILDING FOR FIVE YEARS.

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:25.069
THE SENATE PROTEIN WAS ABLE TO

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.070
PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.905
PROTECTED EMPLOYEES. SO THE

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:29.206
REASON WHY THIS BUILDING

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:30.641
DOESN'T OPERATE LIKE THE REST

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:32.043
OF US OPERATE IN THE PRIVATE

00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:33.110
SECTOR IS COULD YOU WOULDN'T BE

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:34.912
ABLE TO FUNCTION. IT DOESN'T

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.881
WORK AND THAT'S EVIDENT FROM

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.382
WORKING HERE ON BOTH SIDES THAT

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:41.018
THE SENATE SIDE AND IS A SMALL

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:42.219
BUSINESS OWNER. THIS PIECE OF

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:44.055
LEGISLATION. CONSECUTIVE

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:46.023
LANGUAGE WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.792
TO SMALL BUSINESSES I REALIZE

00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:48.959
YOU WENT FROM ZERO TO FIVE

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:49.760
EMPLOYEES AND THERE'S A

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:50.761
PERCENAGE OF EMPLOYEES IT

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.263
WOULD BE SPARED FOR EMPLOYERS

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.798
THAT WOULD BE SPARED FROM THIS.

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:55.433
BUT THIS ALSO DOES NOT CREATE

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.234
CONSECUTIVE LANGUAGE SO A

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:59.236
PERSON. THAT CAN TAKE OFF AS A

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.838
TRUCK DRIVER. EVERY THURSDAY

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:02.640
AND FRIDAY FOR FIFTY TWO WEEKS

00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:03.407
BECAUSE THEY DON'T EQUAL OUT

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:04.942
THAT THE WHOLE TIME FRAME RIGHT

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.177
THE FIFTY TWO WEEKS THE A

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:07.645
QUANTITY OF EIGHT HOURS.

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:09.547
BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONSECUTIVE.

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:10.981
HOW DOES MY COLLEAGUE FROM

00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:13.317
BEAVER FIERY TRACK DRIVER IT

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:15.753

QUALIFICATIONS. TO FILL IN TWO

DAYS A WEEK. IT'S ALMOST

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:26.163
IMPOSSIBLE. IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE

WOUND NOW. I MEAN IT'S REALLY

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:48.152
BAD FOR BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.787
OUT THERE WHEN THEY'RE BARELY

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:52.056

PREMATURELY. AND I WAS PROUD OF

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.854
THE FACT THOSE YOUNG GIRLS WERE

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:40.257
NOW COLLEGE AGE- THAT THAT

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:41.926

TIME BONDING AT A VERY CRITICAL

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:47.298
PERIOD. IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. I

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:48.232
WAS ALSO PROUD TO RUN A

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:51.335
BUSINESS THAT WAS RECOGNIZED IN

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.537
THOSE YOU KNOW RANKING SO. ON

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:55.272
THE BEST COMPANY EMPLOYER TO

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:57.975
WORK FOR. TO BE RECOGNIZED

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:00.711
MULTIPLE YEARS. AND WE WERE

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.313
RECOGNIZE NOT BECAUSE I WAS

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.181
PAYING TOP OF SCALE BASED ON

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.316
THE NATURE OF THE WORK WE WERE

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:06.450
COMPETING WITH GOVERNMENT QUITE

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:07.518
FRANKLY GOVERNMENT COULD PAY

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:09.420
BETTER HAD THEIR RETIREMENT

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:11.889
BENEFITS. BUT WE ALWAYS GOT THE

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:13.791
RANKING IS BEING A PREFERRED

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:16.226
EMPLOYER. BECAUSE OF THE KINDS

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.795
OF POLICIES THAT WE PUT IN

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:20.164
PLACE AS AN EMPLOYER. BECAUSE

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.432
WE WERE NOT GOING TO CREATE

00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:23.567
THIS BIG DIVIDE BETWEEN THE

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:25.035
HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS THAT

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.370
YOU OFTEN HEAR IN THESE

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:28.272
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYERS

00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:33.210
AND THE PEOPLE WHO. HELP THEIR

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:35.212
BUSINESSES FUNCTION BY BEING

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:37.748
THEIR EMPLOYEES. WE WANTED TO

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:39.183
CREATE A CULTURE IN WHICH

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:41.085
PEOPLE WANTED TO COME TO WORK

00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:43.187
AND GIVE THEIR BEST EFFORT TO

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:44.655
HELP US DELIVER THE BEST

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.690
PRODUCT POSSIBLE BY BEING

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:49.727
CONSCIOUS OF THEIR LIVES AND SO

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:50.995
WE WERE PROUD TO BE ABLE TO

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.464
PUT. OUR POLICY IN PLACE AROUND

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.499
FAMILY LEAVE WE WERE PROUD TO

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.368
SUPPORT EMPLOYEES WHO WERE SICK

00:43:57.434 --> 00:43:59.169
BY ALLOWING OTHER EMPLOYEES TO

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:01.772
DONATE TIME WE WERE PROUD TO DO

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:04.008
THAT AND IT SHOWED IN TERMS OF

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.776
THE WORK PRODUCT. THE LOW

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:10.981
TURNOVER. OF MY EMPLOYEES. AND

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:11.882
SO WHAT HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:14.785
TO. I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL THAT

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.854
SOME OF US HAVE HAD GREAT

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.323
INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES WITH

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.825
EMPLOYERS WHO LOVE US. ALLOW US

00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:23.127
TO TAKE TIME TO TAKE CARE OF

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.795
OUR CHILDREN AND OUR

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:27.731
GRANDPARENTS THAT'S WONDERFUL.

00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:29.333
THAT'S OUR INDIVIDUAL LIFE

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.435
EXPERIENCE. AND SO WE'RE

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.904
LOOKING AT. HUNDREDS OF

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:35.406
THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA

00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:37.107
RESIDENTS WHO WORK FOR

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:38.475
COMPANIES WHO DON'T HAVE THOSE

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:40.277
POLICIES AND DON'T HAVE THOSE

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:42.813
PROTECTIONS THAT'S THE POINT OF

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.716
A LOT MAKING. WELL THEN I WOULD

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:47.684
SAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:49.953
DIFFERENTIATE. UNDER THE LAW

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.790
SALARIED EMPLOYEES AND THE WORK

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:54.291
EXPECTATION OF A SALARIED

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.894
EMPLOYEE VERSUS AN HOURLY

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.530
EMPLOYEE IT'S NOT. OKAY TO

00:44:59.596 --> 00:45:01.498
STAND ON THE FLOOR AND MAKE

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:04.001
ASSERTIONS AND JUST MAKE THE

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:05.369
STATEMENTS BECAUSE YOU DON'T

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:07.671
SUPPORT A BILL THAT MAY NOT BE

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.873
ACCURATE. ARE SALARIED

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.642
EMPLOYEES ARE EXPECTED TO DO

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:13.444
THE JOB UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.245
HOURLY EMPLOYEES YOU ALL ARE

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:16.780
WELL AWARE THERE'S A DIFFERENT

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:20.250
LEGAL EXPECTATION. AND I'M SURE

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:21.752
THAT THIS HOUSE AND ALL OF US

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:25.055
IS EMPLOYER HONOR THAT- I AM

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:26.523

SB ONE THREE EIGHT THREE

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.360
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IN THE

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:33.931
BEST INTEREST OF OUR OVERALL.

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:37.234
EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENT.

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:38.669
IT'S TRAGIC THAT IN THIS

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:39.670
COUNTRY OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM

00:45:39.736 --> 00:45:41.905
SAN FRANCISCO IDENTIFIED THAT

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.340
WE CONTINUE TO WHEN WE HAVE

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:46.009
THESE CONVERSATIONS WHEN WE

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:48.612
LOOK AT THIS LIST. LOCAL

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:50.614
ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO LOBBY ON

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:52.116
BEHALF OF BUSINESS IN THE STATE

00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:53.617
OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE CONTINUE

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:54.751
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THE

00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:56.386
CONTEXT OF HAVE VERSUS HAVE

00:45:56.453 --> 00:46:00.157
NOTS US VERSUS THEM. IF

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:02.359
BUSINESS IS IN PROTECTED AND

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:03.994
THE AND THE WHOLE ECONOMY WILL

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:06.630
TANK I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WE

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:07.164
HAVE TO CREATE A SENSE OF

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:10.534
BALANCE. BUT GOVERNMENT HAD TO

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.102
INTERVENE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.470
THERE WAS AN EIGHT HOUR DAY AND

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.139
A FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK THAT

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:17.141
CHILD LABOR LAWS WERE CREATED

00:46:17.207 --> 00:46:19.042
THAT WE AGAIN CREATED

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.944
PROTECTIONS FOR SALARY VERSUS

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:23.780
HOURLY EMPLOYEES. THAT WORK

00:46:23.847 --> 00:46:25.716
PLACES HAVE TO BE INTEGRATED.

00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:27.985
THAT WOMEN COULD ALSO HAVE AN

00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:30.521
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK OUTSIDE OF

00:46:30.587 --> 00:46:32.022
THE HOME IF YOU WILL AND SO

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:33.991
THERE HAS BEEN A CONSTRUCTIVE

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:36.126
IMPORTANT HEALTH THE ROLE THAT

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:38.495
GOVERNMENT IS PLAY. IN MAKING

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:39.863
SURE THE BUSINESS IN THIS

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:41.665
COUNTRY DOESN'T VIOLATE THE

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:43.066
BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE

00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:45.135
PEOPLE THEY EMPLOY FOR ALL

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:46.203
THOSE REASONS I WILL CONTINUE

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.572
SUPPORT THIS CONCEPT ABOUT HOW

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:51.375
WE CREATE A SOCIETY IN WHICH-

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.710
FAMILY IS SUPPORTED. AND PEOPLE

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:56.947

THAT I LOST APPEARANCE INSERTED

IN THE SENATE. I MADE THE

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:07.891
CHOICE TO MISS ONE DAY ON THIS

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:09.159
FOR WHEN MY MOTHER DIED. THE

00:47:09.226 --> 00:47:11.828
CHOICE I MADE. BUT PEOPLE

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:13.597
SHOULD BE FORCED BASED ON THEIR

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.933
EMPLOYMENT STATUS TO DECIDE

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.935
WHAT ROLE THEY'RE GOING PLAY IN

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.503
SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES IN

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.139
THE RIGHT IN GREATEST NEED

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:24.474
CALIFORNIA IS THE STATE THAT

00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:26.710

FAMILY VALUES. THIS IS A

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:44.161

BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD

IN THEIR PROFITS. WE NEED TO

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:01.124
CREATE A BALANCE AND FAIRNESS

BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. ARE

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:19.803

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:16.660
WHAT ARE THE CHOICES THAT THEY

NOTHING. SO WITH A QUIET AT

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:56.733

SHOPKEEPER. AND THEIR MUFFLED

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.172

THEY DON'T WANT THEIR FAMILY TO

00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:09.279
GOING THROUGH. AND WHO ARE THE

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:16.219
SHOPKEEPERS. THERE IMMIGRANTS

THE REFUGEES. THERE PEOPLE OF

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:21.858
COLOR THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:22.659
DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE FROM HIGH

00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:24.628
SCHOOL BUT THEY'VE SCRAP

00:54:24.694 --> 00:54:26.696
TOGETHER THE MONEY TO TRY TO

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:28.965
CREATE AN ENTERPRISE TO TRY TO

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:31.001
MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEM AND

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:35.205
THEIR FAMILIES. SO ARE WE HEAR

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:40.610
ON THE SENATE FLOOR. DEBATING A

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:41.177
MEASURE THAT WILL HOUSE THE

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:44.748
HOMELESS. FEED THE HUNGRY.

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:47.584
PROVIDE RELIEF FOR THOSE WHO

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.619
HAVE LOST A JOB. IS THAT THE

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:51.621
ESSENTIAL WORK IN WHICH WE'VE

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:52.956
COME TOGETHER THIS MORNING THE

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:58.762
DEBATE. I THINK THE ANSWER IS.

00:54:58.828 --> 00:55:01.598
THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:05.168
LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE US. I

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:06.503
THINK ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:10.640
FOR A SENATOR. IS WHEN ONE GETS

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:12.776
A MEASURE THAT IS COMES FROM

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:15.945
THE BIGGEST HEART. THE MOST A

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:16.413
PLACE OF THE GREATEST

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:22.719
COMPASSION. THAT WE KNOW HAS

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.654
THE BEST OF INTENTIONS TO MAKE

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.723
OUR WORLD AND MAKE EACH OF OUR

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:30.193
LIVES BETTER. WHEN WE WHEN THAT

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.261
LEGISLATION COMES IN FRONT OF

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:33.697
US AND YET THE CIRCUMSTANCES OR

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:38.501
THE BUDGET. JUST DOESN'T. MAKE

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:39.836
THAT MOMENT WHERE YOU HAVE TO

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:42.806
SAY YES I'D LIKE TO DO THAT BUT-

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:44.140
IT'S THE HARDEST THING TO SAY

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:53.717
NO. NOT TODAY. NOT RIGHT NOW.

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:54.350
I'M GONNA LEAVE IT TO OTHERS TO

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.453
TALK ABOUT. THE PRIVATE RIGHT

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.221
OF ACTION IN THIS LEGISLATION

00:55:58.288 --> 00:55:58.855
AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:03.560
MAKE. I'M GONNA LEAVE ASIDE THE

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:06.396
ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:09.866
A BUDGET TRAILER BILL. THE

00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:11.868
WARPING OF THE PROCESS. CREATES

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:15.939
PRESSURES I EACH OF YOU THAT

00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:17.874
WOULDN'T BE THERE THIS WAS A

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:18.775
NORMAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:21.111
THAT GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:25.181
IN THE PROPER WAY. I KNOW I

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.449
KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL PASS

00:56:26.516 --> 00:56:32.856
TODAY I KNOW THAT. I GET IT.

00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:34.758
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE THE WAY

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:36.826
THAT WE DO OUR BEST TO WORK IN

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:38.228
THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:40.530
FIND OURSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:43.600
THE PANDEMIC. WITH CONSEQUENCES

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.735
THAT ARE STILL COMPLETELY

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:48.805
UNIMAGINABLE. THE PROPONENTS

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:51.241
HAVE A BIG HEART. THEY'RE

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:54.244
TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.179
AND A DIFFERENT MOMENTS IT

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:57.547
MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD

00:56:57.614 --> 00:57:00.416
BE ADVANCED. ALTHOUGH I KNOW

00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:02.519
IT'LL BE ADVANCE HERE TODAY.

00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:03.987
BUT IN THIS QUIET MOMENTS I DO

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:09.392
HERE. SIGN OF THAT SHOPKEEPER.

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:09.959
AND I THINK THIS IS NOT THE

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:12.061
TIME TO PUT. ADDITIONAL

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:15.131
OBLIGATIONS ON DOWN WITHOUT

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.733
FULL STUDY AND REVIEW. AND WITH

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.501
THAT I UNFORTUNATELY WILL BE

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:22.472
CASTING A NO VOTE. THANK YOU

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.980
THE GOOD SENATORS FROM LOS

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:05.281
ANGELES AND SANTA BARBARA IN

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:07.717
BERKELEY FOR ACTUALLY MAKING

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:08.885
THE POINT TODAY AND THEIR

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:09.819
COMMENTS ABOUT THEIR OWN

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:12.322
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES ABOUT WHY

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:14.991
THIS BILL ISN'T NECESSARY.

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.259
BECAUSE THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:19.329
THEIR EMPLOYER. ALLOW THEM THE

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:21.631
TIME OFF WHEN THEY NEEDED IT OR

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.299
THAT THEY ALLOW THEIR EMPLOYEES

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:24.367
THE TIME OFF WHEN THEY NEEDED

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:26.436
IT WITHOUT THE BIG HAND OF

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:28.471
GOVERNMENT COMING DOWN AND

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:29.572
SMACKING THEM AND SAYING THAT

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.474
THEY HAD TO DO IT. THIS IS WHAT

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:33.343
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DO

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:33.843
BECAUSE THEY VALUE THEIR

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.345
EMPLOYEES THEY WANT TO KEEP

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:36.913
THEM IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE TO

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.047
TRAIN SOMEONE NEW AND MOST

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:39.415
TIMES YOU DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:41.184
YOU REALLY DO BECOME. LIKE A

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:43.419
FAMILY. BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.588
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE FIVE

00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:50.426
EMPLOYEES. AND. HAVE THAT

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:51.628
PERSON LEAVE FOR AN EXTENDED

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:52.862
PERIOD OF TIME IN TRYING TO

00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:53.997
FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO REPLACE

00:58:54.063 --> 00:58:56.766
THEM WHETHER IT'S CONSECUTIVE

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.134
DAYS ARE NOT WHICH I THINK IS A

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.103
VERY INTERESTING POINT I HOPE

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:02.405

KNOWS THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:20.990
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE HURTING

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:23.426
THE MOST. IF ANYBODY WATCH THE

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:26.796
NEWS LAST NIGHT THE LOCAL NEWS.

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:28.698
THEY WERE INTERVIEWING THE

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:30.667
OWNER OF SU ON TRIPS RIGHT HERE

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:32.168

EVERYTHING JUST TO TRY TO STAY

00:59:40.343 --> 00:59:42.312
OPEN AND NOT LOSE THE BUSINESS.

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:44.180

LIKE THIS IN PLACE AT A TIME

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.922
WHEN BUSINESS OWNERS AREN'T

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:54.057
EVEN SURE IF THEY'RE GOING TO

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:56.726

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:58.962
IRRESPONSIBLE. AND I DON'T

00:59:59.028 --> 00:59:59.662

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:10.586
ECONOMIC FREE FALL WHERE MANY

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.360
SO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.863
AUTHOR- I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE ALL

01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:35.865

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.702
PERSEVERED AND JUST STUCK WITH

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.805
IT. AND I AM VERY PROUD TO BE

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:45.174
HERE AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT-

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:47.643

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:48.177
THE LENS OF WHAT'S FOR THE

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:50.279
GREATER GOOD. OF BECAUSE THE

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:56.252
THIS OPINION OVER THAT OPINION

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:58.054
BUT WHAT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.989
THIS BILL IS GOING TO ENSURE

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:04.860
THAT MILLIONS. OF CALIFORNIANS.

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:07.897
WHO PAY INTO PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:06:07.963 --> 01:06:10.533
AND OTHER BENEFITS THAT THEY DO

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:14.036
SO WITHOUT RISKING THEIR JOBS.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.604
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL THING

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:18.240
WITHOUT RISKING THEIR JOBS IN

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:20.176
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MILLIONS.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.345
WHO CAN BE FIRED FOR TAKING

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:24.380
TIME OFF IS BASED ON THE

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.716
EMPLOYER SIZE. SO WHETHER YOU

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:29.952
HAVE FIVE COWORKERS ARE FIVE

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:31.921
HUNDRED YOUR CHILDREN AND ILL

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:33.189
LOVED ONES NEED TO JUST THE

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:36.659
SAME. NO ONE SHOULD BE FIRED

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:38.361
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CHILD OR

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:40.396
GET CANCER OR NEED TO BE WITH

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.899
THE DYING PARENT. AS A LATINA

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:45.701
WOMAN WHO'S WORKED WITH LOW

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:47.536
WAGE WORKERS MOST OF MY ADULT

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:49.939
LIFE. TO SEE THAT LOW WAGE

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:50.873
WORKERS WHO ARE

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.842
DISPROPORTIONATELY PEOPLE OF

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:57.480
COLOR. AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.181
WORK FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:01.817
THEREFORE CURRENTLY LACK JOB

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:04.687
PROTECTION. MOST WORKERS PAY

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.723
IN. OF AN OUT OF EVERY SINGLE

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.292
CHECK BUT LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.229
LESS LIKELY TO USE IT THAN

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:16.665
HIGHER WAGE WORKERS. AND TWENTY

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:17.800
EIGHTEEN WORKERS WHO ARE LESS

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.568
THAN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:22.571
MADE UP. ALMOST 40% OF THE

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.006
WORKFORCE YET THEY ONLY

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.942

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:29.645
OF THE CLAIMS HIGHER EARNERS

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.847
HAD HIGHER UTILIZATION RATES

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:33.682
THIS MEANS THAT PEOPLE EARNING

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:36.652
LOW WAGES ARE SUBSIDIZING

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.655
HIGHER PAID WORKERS. PEOPLE

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.424
EARNING LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.559
LESS LIKELY TO BE AWARE BUT A

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:46.462
TOP REASON THAT DAY REPORT FOR

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:48.664
NOT USING IT IS FEAR OF LOSING

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.000

WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING THIS FOR

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:13.989
THE FIRST TIME WE'RE TALKING

PART OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENT.

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:30.326
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN THESE

WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT STRONG

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:13.936

IS A WIDENING AND THE PAY GAP

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.557

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:50.686
RESOURCES AND INFORMATION. A

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.187

BARBARA- THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.218
THAT SHE HAS CHAMPION FOR MANY

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:33.255
YEARS SO THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:34.523

NATION'S VERY FIRST PAID FAMILY

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.533
LEAVE PROGRAM. IT WAS AN

01:16:44.599 --> 01:16:46.101
ACHIEVEMENT HAVING CALIFORNIA

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.769
LEAD ON THIS ISSUE. BUT THAT

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:49.604
WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF WORK

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:51.540
ON THIS ISSUE. THEY'VE BEEN A

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:53.041
NUMBER OF SUBSEQUENT BILLS BUT

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.543
NOTHING BIGGER THAN WHAT WE'RE

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.478
ABOUT TO VOTE ON TODAY. EVERY

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:58.613
WORKER IN CALIFORNIA PAYS TAXES

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.315
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.250
BEING ABLE TO TAKE A LEAVE. TO

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:03.952
CARE FOR THEIR CHILD AFTER

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:05.954
BIRTH OR SICK FAMILY MEMBER. AS

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:07.489
THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.758
DOING RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:12.494
OF THIS PANDEMIC. THE PROBLEM

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.029
IS TOO MANY WORKERS ARE UNABLE

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:15.397
TO OBTAIN THE BENEFIT THAT THEY

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.631
PAY FOR I THINK MY COLLEAGUE

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:18.500
FROM EAST LA MADE COMMENTS

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:20.402
DIRECTLY TO THIS POINT.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.470
PROVIDING A MOTHER WITH THE

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:23.472
ABILITY TO RETURN TO THEIR JOB

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:24.606
TWELVE WEEKS AFTER GIVING BIRTH

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:25.907
TO ME IS SIMPLY WRITING A

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.410
SOCIETAL WRONG. THAT HAS NEVER

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:31.046
BEEN FIXED. DOES IT MEAN THAT

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.547
IT'S EASY OR THAT IT DOESN'T

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:34.282
COME WITHOUT COST AND

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:36.318
CHALLENGES FOR BUSINESS.FOR

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:38.053
THE COMMUNITY FOR SOCIETY NO I

OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE. MY MOTHER

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.860
DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:47.062
LEAVE WHEN ME. AND MY SIBLINGS

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:48.897
WERE BORN. MY SISTER WASN'T

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.465
ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE AFTER MY

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:52.000
NEPHEW WAS BORN AND INSTEAD I

TOOK THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:54.803
CARE FOR MY NEPHEW SO SHE

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.507
COULD. RETURN TO DUTY. I AS A

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:00.809
NAVY ENSIGN. AND SHE DIDN'T

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:02.844
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HER CHILD

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:04.780
SHE KNEW THAT THAT THAT HER SON

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.715
WOULD BE TAKING CARE OF. YOU

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:08.183
KNOW I THOUGHT IT A GREAT DEAL

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.418
ABOUT MY MOM THESE LAST TWO

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.286
WEEKS YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:12.487
HER BEING A GARMENT WORKER LAST

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:14.556
WEEK. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.525
MY MOM DIED OF CANCER. MY

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:18.794
SISTER WAS TAKING CARE OF HER

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:19.361
AND HER HUSBAND AT THE SAME

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:22.798
TIME. BOTH ARE BOTH DIED WITHIN

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:25.300
A TWO WEEK PERIOD. I HAD TO

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:30.705
WORK. I SAW MY MOM IN MAY IN

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:31.339
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BEFORE SHE

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:34.443
DIED IN AUGUST. BY JULY TWENTY

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:35.610
EIGHTH I GOT A CALL FROM MY

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.846
SISTER HER HUSBAND HAD DIED AND

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:39.214
BECAUSE THEY WERE POLICIES THAT

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:40.682
ALLOWED ME TO GO FOR

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:44.052
BEREAVEMENT LEAVE. I COULD GO.

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:45.220
TO MY SISTER'S HUSBAND'S

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:48.623
FUNERAL AND I WAS VERY SAD BUT

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.826
I WAS ALSO REALLY EXCITED I WAS

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:51.793
GOING TO SEE MY MOTHER ONE MORE

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.029
TIME I KNEW THAT I WOULD GET TO

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:55.297
SEE HER ONE MORE TIME. BEFORE

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:58.500
SHE DIED. I GOT TO TENNESSEE MY

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:02.304
MOM. HAD BECOME COMATOSE. AND

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:06.141
DIED A WEEK LATER. SO EIGHT YOU

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.043
KNOW THESE HAVE REAL IMPACTS ON

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:10.112
FAMILY MEMBERS. I CAN'T HELP

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:11.546
BUT WONDER HOW THE LOTS OF MY

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.115
FAMILY AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:14.983
WILL BE DIFFERENT. IF MOM'S

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.518
WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE TIME TO

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:19.121
BE A MOTHER BEFORE RETURNING TO

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:20.689
WORK OR IF A FAMILY MEMBER HAD

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:22.991
THEABILITY TO BE THERE IN THE

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.693
LAST MOMENTS OF A FAMILY

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:25.794
MEMBER'S LIFE SOMETHING YOU

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:27.696
DON'T GET TO DO OVER. THERE NO

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:33.001
DO OVERS. YOU KNOW- I WOULD

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:34.569
JUST COMMENT ON TO THE POINTS

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:36.905
MADE BACK COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:39.708
ARBITRARY TO MINUS OF EMPLOYERS

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:42.310
IS IT CONSIST NOR INSURED.

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.012
HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF PROOF OF

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.914
ABUSE OF EMPLOYEES WE'RE NOT

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:47.749
TALKING ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS TO

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.518
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. MANY

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:50.886
EMPLOYERS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:52.320
HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY CARE

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:53.688
ABOUT THEIR WORKERS THOSE

01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:56.558
AREN'T EMPLOYERS OR EMPLOYEES.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:57.325
EMPLOYERS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED

01:19:57.392 --> 01:20:00.095
ABOUT. I RECOGNIZE THAT. AND

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:02.430
ANOTHER POINT. YOU KNOW PRIVATE

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:05.767
BUSINESS REQUIRES WORKERS. IT

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:08.103
IS A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:09.638
THAT. TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND GET

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:11.673
THEIR NEEDS MET YOU CAN'T HAVE

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.141
A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WITHOUT

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:16.545
WORKERS. AND SO YOU KNOW

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:18.213
THERE'S NO REVENUE IF THERE'S

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.282
NO SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP FOR

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.083
ANY OF US TO DIVIDE UP OR THINK

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.052
ABOUT OR DISCUSS WHO SHOULD PAY

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:27.055
WIDEN. WHAT A MOUNTAIN AND ALL

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.924
OF THOSE THINGS RELATED TO HOW

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.958

TIME OVER THE PAST. SIX WEEKS

01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:58.280
SPEAKING TO SMALL BUSINESS

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.714
OWNERS IN MY COMMUNITY NOT

PANIC. MANY OF THEM WILL NEVER

OPEN AGAIN. MANY OF THEM ARE

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:14.029
STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:14.496
DURING THESE VERY VERY

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:17.532
DIFFICULT TIME. AND THEIR

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.977
BE ABLE TO CONTINUE I HAVE

ALMOSTA HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL

BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT. AND

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.215
A MAJORITY OF THOSE SMALL

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:37.052
BUSINESSES ARE IMMIGRANTS. THEY

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:37.652
ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME FROM

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:39.154
OTHER COUNTRIES. AND QUITE

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.256
FRANKLY ARE REALLY STRUGGLING

01:22:41.323 --> 01:22:42.724
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.626
RULES. THAT WE IMPOSE ON SMALL

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:47.262
BUSINESSES. AND MANY OF THEM

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:49.364
ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. AND

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.866
SO THE MOMENT THAT AN EMPLOYEE

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.802
UNDER THIS BILL SHOWS UP AND

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:55.737

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:16.091
POSITION THEY'RE IN VIOLATION

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:19.494
OF THE LAW. AND THE PROBLEM IS

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.495
THAT USUALLY IN THE CONSTRUCT

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:22.497

DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:31.439
HOUSING. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.641
DATA. THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:35.410
THIS LEGISLATURE THEY DO NOT

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:38.046
HAVE A BACKLOG. OF CASES AND

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:38.847
QUITE FRANKLY THEY RESOLVE

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:40.515
CASES VERY QUICKLY AND THEY

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.183
HAVE A MEDIATION UNIT SO THAT

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:44.119
THEY CAN SIT DOWN AND WALK YOU

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:46.020
THROUGH AND TELL SMALL BUSINESS

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:47.422
EMPLOYERS HERE'S WHAT SHOULD

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:49.157
HAPPEN BUT INSTEAD WHAT WE DID

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.425
IN THIS BILL IS WE CREATED A

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:52.427
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHICH

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:53.461
MEANS YOU CAN HIRE YOUR OWN

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:55.864
ATTORNEY YOU CAN SUE AND THEN

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.298
ALL OF A SUDDEN OU'RE STARTING

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:58.400

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:12.080
CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE IS THIS

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:14.082

PROPOSAL. AS A BUDGET BILL AND

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:23.458
THE PROCESS IS BEEN. VERY

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:25.160
STRANGE BECAUSE NORMALLY THIS

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:25.927
WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:27.629
POLICY COMMITTEES AND WE WOULD

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:28.196
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:29.931
SOME OF THE STUFF IN A POLICY

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:32.500
CONTEXT. IT HASN'T BEEN

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:35.136
PROVIDED IT WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:38.206
BECAUSE NUMBER ONE THERE'S BEEN.

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:40.975
AB RELUCTANCE TO NEGOTIATE SO

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.610
THE ONE THE ONE AMENDMENT

FRANKLY WAS TO GO FROM ONE

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:47.248
EMPLOYEE TO FIVE DOESN'T MAKE

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:48.516

EMPLOYEES THIS THIS IS A. A

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:56.558
POLICY I WANT TO SUPPORT. BUT

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.193
THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN IS

01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:00.028
FLAWED AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:03.231
CHANCE TO REALLY MAKE THE

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:03.865
DIFFERENCE THE CORRECTIONS THAT

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.767
NEED TO BE MADE. IN ORDER FOR

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.435
IT TO ACTUALLY WORK FOR SMALL

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:11.039
BUSINESSES AS WELL. AND SO. I

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:13.842
REGRETTABLY STAND HERE. AND SAY

01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:18.346
ON BEHALF OF MY- ONE HUNDRED

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:18.980
THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:21.783
DISTRICT. BUT WE HAVE AN

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.785
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS RIGHT.

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:26.321
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:27.822

PROTECTED THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:30.492
RIGHT TO TAKE THIS LEAVE THAT

PROTECTED IN THE WHOLE PROCESS

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.769
AND IF WE CAN'T DO THAT I THINK

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:42.337
WE OUGHT TO. PUT THIS ON THE

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:44.906
SLOW TRACK. DEAL WITH THIS IS A

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:48.776

MYSELF BUT OF COURSE ABOUT OF

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:30.318
THE FOSTER PARENTS THAT ARE

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:32.053

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:35.023
BUT MANY ARE WHO ARE MY

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:37.492
CONSTITUENTS THE FIRST. YOU

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:38.660
KNOW COMING FROM A LARGE

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:39.894
CORPORATION I WAS PERSONALLY

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:41.362

LEAVE POLICIES BUT I THINK IT

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:57.078
WAS A BIG TELLER. ESPECIALLY

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.646

TWELVE CONSECUTIVE WEEKS WITH

01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:22.503

BORDERS. TODAY'S DEBATE HAS

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:47.675
BEEN. VERY INSIGHTFUL I

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:49.410

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:54.081
IMPRESSED BY COMMONSENSE HEARD

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:57.985
FROM LOYAL DEMOCRATS. WHO HAVE

01:30:58.052 --> 01:31:01.589
TAKEN A- STRONG STAND ON THIS

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.891
ISSUE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:07.461
WITH MORE DEBATE MORE ON

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:10.031
DISCUSSION. ESPECIALLY THE

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:12.200
PERTAINS TO- PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:31:12.266 --> 01:31:14.635
ACTION THIS COULD BE

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:16.170
DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED UPON. BUT

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:18.172
GIVEN THE OF THE PROCESSES THAT

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:19.073
IT'S GONE THROUGH THE SHORT

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.408
CUTS THAT WERE MADE FOR A

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:22.376
VARIETY OF REASONS I THINK WE

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:23.511
MIGHT HAVE A PRODUCT. THAT IS

01:31:23.578 --> 01:31:27.348
NOT. RIGHT FOR A STABILITY PLAN

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:29.517
TODAY IN OTHER WORDS IT'S AT

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.118
THIS POINT IN TIME IS NOT READY

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:33.454
FOR PRIME TIME. SO I WOULD

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:35.389
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE FOLKS. THAT

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:39.026
IN THE AUTHOR. ON TO REVISIT

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:41.128
SOME OF THESE COMPELLING ISSUES

01:31:41.195 --> 01:31:42.830
I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:45.433
THIS BETTER FROM- THE VIEWPOINT

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:47.335
ACROSS THE AISLE AND I THINK

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:49.403
WOULD IMPROVE UPON THE PRODUCT

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.571
I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.506
THIS MATTER BE BROUGHT BACK AT

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:55.476
A LATER POINT TIME. THANK YOU

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.751
WAS NOT INTENDING TO RISE ON

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:08.089
THE BILL. AND I'M RISING ON THE

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:12.493
BILL BUT MORE I'M RISING

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.763
SUPPORTING A COLLEAGUE. THE

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:19.400
LIVE SHARED A COMMON EXPERIENCE.

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:21.736
WE HAS LEGISLATORS HAVE MANY

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:23.905
THINGS TO BALANCE OUR OWN

01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:25.706
CONVICTION AND FUNDAMENTAL

01:32:25.773 --> 01:32:28.476
BELIEFS WHICH I'VE ALWAYS

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:31.045
ARGUED SHOULD BE PREEMINENT. WE

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:33.915
HAVE THE PARTY THAT WE ARE A

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:35.783
MEMBER OF TO BE RESPECTFUL AND

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:39.186
HELPFUL TO. AND MOST

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:40.988
IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE THE PEOPLE.

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:44.592
THAT WE REPRESENT. NOW WE OF

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:46.560
COURSE CANNOT REPRESENT

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:49.130
EVERYBODY ON ALL ISSUES. WE DO

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:51.065
THE VERY BEST WE CN. TO BE

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:54.769
CONSISTENT. WHEN  FIRST RAN

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:57.872
THE DISTRICT TO DIE. INSPIRED

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:00.975
TO WAS 60% DEMOCRAT 30%

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:04.612
REPUBLICAN. NOT REALLY VERY

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:08.749
GOOD ODDS. BUT IT WORKED OUT

01:33:08.816 --> 01:33:11.819
AND I FOUND OUT. THAT I COULD

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:14.221
BE TRUE TO MY CONVICTIONS. NOT

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:17.091
A TRAIT THE PARTY. AND

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:20.261
REPRESENTS A STRONG MAJORITY

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:24.532
DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT. AND KEY TO

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:25.833
THAT WAS BEING ATTENTIVE TO THE

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.401
NEEDS OF THE CONSTRUCTION WHICH

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:28.502
WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:29.870
THING WE DO IT IS MORE

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:31.138
IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.541
PHILOSOPHIC THINGS OR PARTY

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:35.576
THINGS WE ASPIRE TO AN- OUT

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:40.014
HERE. WELL THEN WE HAD A

01:33:40.081 --> 01:33:42.717
REAPPORTIONMENT COME ALONG. AND

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:43.818
THEN IT BECAME A BIT MORE

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:46.487
DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE DISTRICT

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.823
BECAME A BIT MORE REPUBLICAN

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.624
THEN I THINK THE HIGHEST EVER

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:52.693
GOT WAS 34% BUT THERE WERE MORE

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.796
REPUBLICANS. AND UNLIKE THE

01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:57.665
MEMBER WHO I'M REFERRING TO

01:33:57.732 --> 01:34:01.535
FROM SALINAS. SHE REPRESENTS

01:34:01.602 --> 01:34:05.306
VALLEY COUNTIES. AND COASTAL

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:08.476
COUNTIES. I HAD A SIMILAR

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:10.578
CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE IN THE

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.513
SECOND REAPPORTIONMENT PICKED

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.748
UP A LOT OF THE SACRAMENTO

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.182
VALLEY COUNTIES WHICH WERE VERY

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:17.451
DIFFERENT. THEN SOME OF THE

01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:20.221
FORMER COUNTIES. SO IT WAS A

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:24.291
MORE CHALLENGING. TIME BUT I

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:24.859
DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:28.262
THAT. I CAN BY AND WORK WITH%

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.663
THE MEMBERS AND THE CITIZENS OF

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.065
THE DISTRICT NAY YET INTEREST

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:32.833
THAT WE HAD THERE IN THOSE

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.735
DISTRICTS THAT WERE COMMON. AND

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:38.139
TRIED TO BE ATTENTIVE TO THEM.

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:44.078
AND IT WORKED OUT FOR ME. WELL.

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:45.446
I SEE THE PRESSURE THE CHEESE

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:48.182
AND DURING. NOT TO BE

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:51.786
UNEXPECTED. BUT WHAT I WOULD

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.554
MOST ASSUREDLY ADD THERE OUGHT

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:55.523
TO BE NO RETALIATION FROM ANY

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:59.760
SOURCE FOR A MEMBER. WHO

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:00.294
SUPPORTS THE DISTRICT THEY

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:02.696
REPRESENT. AND DOES THE VERY

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:03.998
BEST TO DO THAT KNOWING THAT

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:06.167
SOME IN THAT DISTRICT WILL NOT

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:09.170
LIKE WHAT THEY DO. BUT I SHOULD

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:12.139
LET FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:13.674
THOUGH THEY MAY NOT LIKE IT.

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:18.245
THEY WILL STILL RESPECT. AN

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:19.747
ELECTRICIAN ONE BIT FURTHER

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:21.215
WITH A BIT OF A HUMOROUS

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:24.652
ADDITION. ONE OF THE

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:26.087
COMMUNITIES THAT I FIRST

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:29.690
REPRESENTED WAS DAVIS. I WON

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:31.358
THE DISTRICT BY 54% BUT LOST IN

01:35:31.425 --> 01:35:35.729
DAVIS. BY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:39.500
VOTES I BELIEVE. NEXT TIME

FIVE HUNDRED VOTES. WELL THE

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.523
AFRAID I'M I'M GETTING OUT OF

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.691
TUNE WITH THE DISTRICT I'M

01:36:03.757 --> 01:36:04.725
GOING TO WORK REALLY HARD THE

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:08.028
NEXT FOUR YEARS THE LOSE BY A

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:08.629
GREATER MARGIN AND DAVIS. NEXT

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:11.599
TIME. NOW THAT SPOKEN FUN AT

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:13.567
IT. BUT IT WOULDN'T BEEN

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:16.437
INDIFFERENCE HAD I STAYED

REPRESENTING DAVIS YOU ATTEND

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:20.274
TO THE- POPULATION. THE END AND

01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:21.609
THAT'S WHAT MADE A DIFFERENCE

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:24.378
TO ME THAT THAN QUANTIFIES HOW

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:26.413
ONE CAN SUCCESSFULLY BALANCE.

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.083
FROM VERY DIFFERENT INTEREST IN

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.017
THE DISTRICT THAT THEY

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:32.153
REPRESENT. AND FURTHER WHY IT

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:33.988
IS IMPORTANT FOR A MEMBER TO DO

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:36.357
THAT. AND THAT NUMBER IS

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:37.925
COMMENDABLY BALANCING THOSE

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:41.462
CONCERNS AND THAT ARGUES I

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:43.697
THINK TO A NO VOTE. THANK YOU

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:45.666
CENTER NIELSEN MEMBER SEEING NO

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:48.969
FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:50.871
CENTER JACKSON YOU MAY CLOSE.

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:52.306
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:54.308
REALLY O APPRECIATE THIS

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:56.644
ROBUST AND HARDY DEBATE I AM

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.913
TOTALLY CONVINCED THAT MY SEVEN

01:36:58.979 --> 01:36:59.947
AND FOUR YEAR OLD GRAND

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:02.416
CHILDREN HAVE LOST INTEREST

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:04.652
THOUGH IN THIS DISCUSSION.

01:37:04.718 --> 01:37:06.987
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT

01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:08.822
WE HAVE SPENT ON IT- BUT I DO

01:37:08.889 --> 01:37:10.991
THINK IT'S A WORTHY DISCUSSION

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:13.360
AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE. THOSE

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:16.530
IN SUPPORT AS WELL AS THOSE.

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:17.731
WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:19.767
BILL I DO THINK THIS IS A

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:22.836
QUESTION OF WHAT OUR PRIORITIES

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:25.606
MORE. AND THAT'S WHY I AM IN

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:27.374
EARNEST IN STRONG SUPPORT AND

01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:29.743
HOPE THAT ULTIMATELY. YOU WILL

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:31.845
ALSO A VOTE FOR THIS BILL AS

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:34.181
WELL WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:37.117
ADDRESS. SOME OF THEM

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:39.753
MISUNDERSTANDING. THAT EXISTS

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.589
FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:43.457
SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:46.894
FURTHER. ANALYSIS THIS ISSUE

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:49.230
HAS BEEN AN HOUR ANALYZE FOR

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:51.899
YEARS FOR DECADES. THE STUDIES

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:54.668
THAT FORM THE BASIS UPON WHICH

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:56.904
THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:59.773
SUGGESTED THIS LEGISLATION HAVE

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.476
GONE ON FOR YEARS. THERE ARE AT

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.245
LEAST FOUR FIVE THAT I'VE READ

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:05.379
THAT WERE WRITTEN IN THE LAST

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:10.017
COUPLE YEARS THE DEAL WITH AND

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:10.918
GO BACK TO EARLIER THE SKY. AND

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:13.287
EARLIER RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:14.922
THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESEARCHED

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:19.493
TO THE MAXIMUM. IT SHOWS THAT

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.996
GIVING NEW PARENT LEAVE IS GOOD

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:23.697
FOR THE FOR THE INFANT IS GOOD

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:26.667
FOR THE MOTHER. REDUCING POST

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:28.836
PARTUM DEPRESSION BY THIRD AND

01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:31.171
GOOD FOR A NEW DAD. AND WE'RE

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:32.840
SEEING MORE MORE DADS TAKING

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:36.443
THIS LEAVE. SO THE RESEARCHERS

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:40.881
THERE. THIS LEGISLATION AGAIN

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:43.517
HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT THE FACT

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:44.885
THAT WE HAVE A PAID FAMILY

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:47.121
LEAVE PROGRAM BUT A LOT OF

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:48.889
PEOPLE DON'T ACCESS IT IN THE

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:50.658
ROOM THE REASON IS BECAUSE

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:52.026
THERE'S NO ASSURANCE THAT GOT

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:56.730
THE JOB. AND THIS ESSENTIALLY

01:38:56.797 --> 01:38:59.600
PUTS THE CAP ON BACK CONSERVE.

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.201
IT ADDRESSES IT IT'S A TWO FOLD

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:04.571
THE ISSUE. THE ABILITY TO TAKE

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.940
LEAVE THE TO PAY FOR. AND BE

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:08.309
SURE YOU GET YOUR JOB WHEN YOU

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:11.545
COME BACK. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:13.280
THIS ISN'T ABOUT AB FIVE

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:14.748
BECAUSE TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES ARE

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:16.850
NOT SUBJECT TO THE INDEPENDENT

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:19.253
CONTRACTOR ISSUE. AB FIVE IS

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.456
NOT AN ISSUE. AND LIKE MANY OF

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:23.924
YOU I'VE ACTUALLY HAD A SMALL

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:27.828
BUSINESS TO. AND I HAVE STORIES

OF MY STAFF NEEDING TO GO OUT

01:39:31.031 --> 01:39:34.068
ON LEAVE. THEY DON'T JUST CALL

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:36.070
UP AND SAY I'VE GOT TO TAKE

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:38.706
TWELVE WEEKS OFF. THERE ARE

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:39.807
REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.809
LEGISLATION. THERE ARE

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:47.348
REQUIREMENTS. THAT IF YOU. HAVE

01:39:47.414 --> 01:39:51.318
AN EMERGENCY. THEN YOU CAN TAKE

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:53.354
THAT EMERGENCY TIME OFF BUT

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:55.656
OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO GIVE AT

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:58.425
LEAST THIRTY DAYS NOTICE LET ME

01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:00.794
MAKE SURE I HAVE THIS CORRECT.

YOU HAVE TO GIVE AT LEAST

01:40:02.596 --> 01:40:05.833
THIRTY DAYS NOTICE- IF BELIEVE

01:40:05.899 --> 01:40:08.202
IS PREDICTABLE. SO IF YOU'RE

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:10.771
GOING TO TAKE LEE BECAUSE YOU

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:12.940
ARE GOING TO HAVE A BABY. NOW

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:14.575
MOST PEOPLE WILL TELL THEIR

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:17.444
EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY FIND OUT.

01:40:17.511 --> 01:40:18.779
THIS IS A JOYFUL MOMENT FOR

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:21.248
MOST PEOPLE. AND THEY ARE GOING

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:22.883
TO SHARE WITH THEIR EMPLOYER

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:25.919
HEY LOOK. I AM GOING TO HAVE A

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:28.589
BABY ON TWO X. POINT AND I

01:40:28.655 --> 01:40:30.991
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE MY LEAVE AT

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:34.595
THAT POINT IN TIME. NOW ONE OF

01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:35.529
THE THINGS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:38.565
TO BY THE WAY. IS THAT A GOOD

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:42.770
PORTION OF THIS LEAVE IS UNPAID.

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:44.438
SO PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO RUN

01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:46.840
OUT AND START TAKING LEAVE.

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.208
THEY DON'T GET PAID WHEN THEY

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:51.278
TAKE THAT LEAVES. THEY CAN GET

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:53.080
PARTIAL JOB REPLACEMENT FROM

01:40:53.147 --> 01:40:54.415
THEIR OWN MONEY FROM THEIR

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:56.383
SAVINGS ACCOUNT BUT FOR A LOT

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:57.017
OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY LOW

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:58.886
INCOME WORKERS THAT ISN'T

01:40:58.952 --> 01:41:01.488
ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR ENDS MEET

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:04.558
PEOPLE TAKE THIS LEAVE BECAUSE

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:06.894
THEY NEED TO TAKE A SWING. THEY

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.029
TAKE THIS LEAVE BECAUSE THEY

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:11.498
HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER. IT WAS

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:13.167
MENTIONED BY MY GOOD COLLEAGUE

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:15.068
FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT

01:41:15.135 --> 01:41:18.038
SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE HER MOTHER

01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:20.073
FOR CANCER TREATMENTS. ARE

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:22.443
THOSE TREATMENTS OF COURSE ARE

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:24.244
USUALLY SCHEDULED IN ADVANCE

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:25.612
AND IF YOU NEED TO TAKE A

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:30.884
FRIDAY OFF EVERY OTHER WEEK.

01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:31.518
FOR TO TAKE A PARENT FOR CANCER

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:32.119
TREATMENT OR IF YOU NEED YOUR

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:37.257
OWN CANCER TREATMENT. AS SOME

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:40.160
OF US IN THIS ROOM HAVE HAD.

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:41.695
YOU KNOW WHEN THOSE TREATMENTS

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:44.598
OR AND YOU DESPERATELY NEED TO

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:46.633
TAKE THAT TIME OFF FROM WORK IN

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:47.968
PART FRANKLY BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:49.236
TREATING YOUR EMPLOYER IF YOU

01:41:49.303 --> 01:41:50.771
GO BACK TO WORK WHEN YOU'RE

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:55.175
FEELING CRAPPY. LET'S FACE IT

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.743
ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM EITHER

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:59.680
OURSELVES OR OUR LOVED ONES

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:02.716
HAVE HAD THOSE MOMENTS WHERE WE

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:05.118
NEED TO BE THERE FOR THEM. AND

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.954
IF YOU AREN'T THERE FOR THEM.

01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:08.222
YOU WILL HAVE MISSED OUT ON

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:10.457
BOTH THE JOY AND THE

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:13.927
RESPONSIBILITY. OF CARING FOR

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:19.233
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE. SO

01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:23.337
THE NOTION THAT AN EMPLOYER.

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:25.973
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL YOU.

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:30.043
WHEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT LEAVE.

01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:30.644
IS A QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:32.880
YOURSELF. YOU DON'T JUST TAKE

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:34.248
LEAVE BECAUSE SHE WANTED THE

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:36.383
LAW REQUIRES THAT YOU'RE TAKING

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:38.418
IT FOR A MAJOR MEDICAL REASON

01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:39.853
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.222
DEMONSTRATE THAT. OR WHAT DO

01:42:42.289 --> 01:42:43.323
YOU WANT TO BOND WITH THE

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:45.526
NEWBORN AS A MOTHER OR A

01:42:45.592 --> 01:42:47.728
FATHER. AN INCH TODAY'S WORLD

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:49.296
WE KNOW THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE NOT

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:52.599
ABLE TO BE IN THE WORK FORCE

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:54.935
THEIR FAMILY SUFFER. AND WE DO

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:57.971
KNOW. AND THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR

01:42:58.038 --> 01:42:59.740
THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT TO

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:02.609
SMALL BUSINESSES. TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:02.676 --> 01:43:05.078
GIVE. THEIR EMPLOYEES THE TIME

01:43:05.145 --> 01:43:07.347
OFF AND BRING THEM BACK WITHOUT

01:43:07.414 --> 01:43:10.817
HAVING TO GET NEW EMPLOYEES THE

01:43:10.884 --> 01:43:11.685
COST OF RETENTION OR EXCUSE ME

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:14.054
THE COST OF RETRAINING. THE

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:16.723
COST OF GOING OUT AND TRYING TO

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:19.059
FIND NEW PEOPLE. IS STEPS. TO

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:22.129
THESE COME IN THE RESEARCH

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:23.363
SHOWS THAT THE COME. EITHER

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:24.665
SMALL COME AND THEY'RE BEEN

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:26.366
STUDIES DONE OF THIS AND I

01:43:26.433 --> 01:43:28.468
APPRECIATE THAT MY COLLEAGUES

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:29.836
HAVE TALKED TO SOME OF THEIR

01:43:29.903 --> 01:43:31.805
WORK OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:33.307
IF THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:34.575
THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL

01:43:34.641 --> 01:43:37.144
TELL YOU THAT ACTUALLY THEY

01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:39.346
WERE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY. AND

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:40.614
THAT THEIR WORKERS COME BACK

01:43:40.681 --> 01:43:42.316
THERE MORE EFFECTIVE THE MORE

01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:44.051
EFFICIENT THEY'RE MORE LOYAL

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.886
THEY STAY LONGER IN THE JOB

01:43:45.953 --> 01:43:50.057
THOSE ARE THE FACTS. WE KNOW

01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:54.962

EFFECTIVELY THE SITUATION HAS

01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:23.583
BEEN RESOLVED. HOW FREQUENTLY

USE THIS USED VERY VERY RARELY.

01:45:28.822 --> 01:45:30.924
BECAUSE EMPLOYEES DON'T WANT TO

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.492
SUE YOU THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:34.027
THE TIME OFF THE BOND WITH A

NEWBORN OR TO TAKE CARE OF A

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:41.902
PARENT OR A CHILD. THREE ME. I

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:43.370
MEAN I THINK WE ALL HAVE THOSE

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:44.771
STORIES AND TO SAY THAT

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:46.707
EMPLOYERS GIVE YOU THAT RIGHT

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:48.575

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.615
THE DOZENS IF NOT TENS OF

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:58.085
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:45:58.151 --> 01:46:00.187
COME BEFORE COMMITTEES ARE TO

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:02.622
TESTIFY. THE ANGUISH OF THEIR

01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:04.691
INABILITY TO TAKE THE LEAVE I

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:06.727
REMEMBER WE HAD A FIRE FIGHTER

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:09.062

01:46:09.129 --> 01:46:12.232

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:19.039
HIS SCHEDULE AROUND THE HIS

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:22.008
CHILDREN. AND HE WAS FIRED

01:46:22.075 --> 01:46:25.011
BECAUSE OF THAT. HE WAS ONE OF

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:27.481
MY WITNESSES WHO CAME IN A DAD

01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:29.116
WHO JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:31.618

HIS CHILDREN AS WELL. AND I
