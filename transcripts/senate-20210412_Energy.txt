SENATOR BRADFORD. SENATE BRADFORD HERE JERRY HAVE CORN. OKAY VERY WELL WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL MOVE ON. TO THE FIRST ITEM. WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR OUR FIRST AUTHOR IS ON BILL NUMBER S. B. TWO H. AND WE HAVE WITH US SENATOR CABALLERO CHIU- PRESENT ON RURAL BROADBAND AND DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE. VIDEO COMPETITION REFORM ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SENDER WELCOME PRESENT WHEN YOU READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWENTY EIGHT THE RURAL BROADBAND AND DIDN'T COVER REFORM ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND ONE I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THE BILL. FIRST THE BILL EXPANDS AND CODIFIES INTO STATUTE ACTIONS THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM SAID PORT PORT IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER REGARDING THE USE OF STATE PROPERTIES TO EXPEDITE BROADCAST. BROADBAND NETWORK DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT. SB TWENTY EIGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES CALTRANS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OUR TASK TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE STATE PROPERTY. RIGHTS OF WAYS WIRELESS SPECTRUM AND OTHER ASSETS THAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO EITHER PRIVATE OR MUNICIPAL BROADCAST PROVIDERS. THAT CAN EASILY BE LEAST THROUGH BOILER PLATE LICENSE AGREEMENTS. WHETHER IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHING AND WILDLIFE OFFICE IN MODOC COUNTY OR A CALTRANS RIGHT AWAY THE STATE CAN CONTRIBUTE THE ASSETS. AND THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS AND CREATE A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO MAKE BROADER DEPLOYMENTS. FASTER AND MORE AFFORDABLE. THIS IS HAPPENING BY WILL TODAY IN MY SENATE DISTRICT THE PATTERSON SCHOOL DO WAS ABLE TO LAUNCH DISTRICT WIFI BY LEVERAGING THAT DISTINCT DISTRICTS PROPERTY A SUITABLE LOCATIONS DESPITE THE WIFI TOWERS. THE STATE CAN MAKE IT EASIER. BOB FOUR PATTERSON AND OTHER PARTNERS SHIPPED WITHIN SB TWENTY EIGHT. SECOND SB TWENTY EIGHT AMENDS THE FIRST TIME A STATUTE CALLED THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE VIDEO COMPETITION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX OR DEBORAH. DEBORAH PROVIDES CABLE AND TELECOMMUTE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES WITH THE STATEWIDE TEN YEARS LONG FRANCHISE LICENSE TO DEPLOY DIGITAL VIDEO SERVICES. SINCE DIFFICULT PASSED THE DIGITAL VIDEO PAY TV BUSINESS ACCOMPLISHED COMPLETE MARKET SATURATION MEANING PAY TV SERVICES ARE AS UBIQUITOUS AS ENERGY AND WATER UTILITIES. NEARLY A COMMODITY AND THEIR SCALE WHAT IS NOT CHANGED IS THAT WHILE DIFFICULT WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING COMPETITION TO THE PAY TV MARKET IT DID NOT. WELL DIFFICULT PROVIDES THE CPUC WITH THE ABILITY TO GRANT A STATEWIDE PAY TV FRANCHISE LIGHT LICENSE. THAT SAME NETWORK PATHWAY THAT FIRST DELIVERED PAY TV TO CONSUMERS NOW DELIVERS A BUNDLE OF COMPLETE COMMITTEE CONSUMER SERVICES MOST LOAD MODE MOST NOTABLY BROADBAND. THE CURRENT DIFFICULT FRANCHISEES OFTEN DELIVER A PAY TV. BROADBAND VOICE IP AND HOME SECURITY ALL THROUGH THE SAME NETWORK. CONSUMERS HAVE ONE CABLE THAT COMES INTO THEIR HOME NOT FOR SEPARATE NETWORKS ONE BILL THAT COMES FROM THE FRANCHISEE NOT FOR. IT'S A BUNDLE OF SERVICES THAT CONSUMERS PAY FOR TOGETHER ALL DELIVERED UNDER THE BENEFIT OF THE SINGLE DIFFICULT. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE BUNDLE IS NOT EQUAL ACROSS THE STATE. JUST A HANDFUL OF THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT DIFFICULT LICENSEES PROVIDE BROADBAND TO APPROXIMATELY. 96% OF THE STATE. S. TWENTY IS THE AND FOR TWO MILLION CAL WITH BROAD. THAT STILL PAY A DIFFICULT FRANK FRANCHISE. FRANCHISEE FOR PAY TV. ENTIRE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR ESSENTIAL PURCHASES ONLINE. WORK FROM HOME AS REQUIRED BY THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER ACCESS VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS LIKE TO ZOOM. OR EDUCATIONAL PLATFORMS LIKE GOOGLE CLASSROOM SO THAT CHILDREN AND COLLEGE STUDENTS CAN ATTEND SCHOOL. THE ABANDONED COMMUNITIES ARE IN MANY CASES RURAL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ARE UNIFORMLY UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW INCOME LOW POPULATION DENSITY OR BOTH. THE PICTURE OF THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS IN FRONT OF THE TACO BELL IN ORDER TO ACCESS INTERNET FOR SCHOOL IS ON HAUNTING PICTURE FROM MY DISTRICT THE DRIVES HOME THE STATE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. SB TWENTY EIGHT REFORMS DAVE DITKA REQUIRING DATA TO BE REPORTED TO THE CPUC SO THAT FINALLY THE STATE WILL HAVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING. OF WHICH SUBSCRIBERS HAVE WHICH SERVICES IN THE BUNDLE AND THE CORRESPONDING PRICE POINTS. GAINING THIS ACCURATE NEXT NETWORK MAP IS CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THIS DATA THE CPUC CANNOT READILY DETERMINE IF A LICENSE SHOULD BE RENEWED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TERM OF TEN YEARS. AND RENEWING FOR THAT LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT THIS DATA IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. SB TWENTY EIGHT HAS A CLEAR INTENT. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE. CONSUMER INFORMATION BEING SHARED. THE BILL FIXES STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES IN THE DIFFICULT LICENSE GRANT THAT ALLOWED FOR REDLINING OF SERVICES IN URBAN AREAS AND UNDER INVESTMENT IN IN RURAL AREAS IT DOES THIS BY REQUIRING THE CPUC TO CONSULT WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE FRANCHISEE'S SERVICE TERRITORY REGARDING REMEDIES FOR THE SERVICE IMPACTS AS PART OF ANY PROCEEDING TO SUSPEND OR REVOKE THE FRANCHISE AND IT IS THE STICK THAT MATTERS MOST BECAUSE PRIOR TO DIFFICULT. FRANCHISE HOLDERS HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GAMING SUBSCRIBER ACCESS- AND MISTER CHAIR YOU MAY REMEMBER THOSE DAYS WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD NEGOTIATE WITH WITH- THESE PROVIDERS AND CONTROL A WHOLE BUNCH OF- POINTS- IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF SERVICES WOULD BE PROVIDED GIVE COVER REMOVED LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES FROM THE TABLE AND SB TWENTY EIGHT RESTORES LOCAL EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY SHIFTING THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF NEGOTIATING THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS BACK TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. MY WITNESSES SUPPORT IS KIMBERLY BALLOT AS FROM TRANQUILITY A SMALL TOWN AB FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE LOCATED IN THE RURAL HEART MST TWELVE KIMBERLY IS NOT AN EXPERT ON BROADBAND NETWORK CONSTRUCTION OR CABLE FRANCHISE LICENSING HE'S HERE TO TELL YOU HOW RURAL SMALL AND OFTEN POOR COMMUNITIES ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND LISTEN TO KIMBERLY'S EXPERIENCE AND THEN ANSWER THE SIMPLE QUESTION DOES YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ON SB TWENTY EIGHT LEVEL THE FIX PLAYING FIELD FOR THE NEXT YEAR TEENAGER FROM TRANQUILITY.

YES I'M HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION APPRECIATES THE OUT THERE'S A GOAL OF ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICE BUT WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED SB TWENTY EIGHT IT IS AN UNLAWFUL EXPANSION OF THE STATE'S VIDEO FRANCHISING AUTHORITY IT IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY DETER INVESTMENT IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE STATE'S FIFTY OF. ISSUE CABLE VIDEO FRANCHISES IS DERIVED FROM TITLE SIX. OKAY THAT THAT LAW EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS FRANCHISING AUTHORITY BLIGHTED PC FOR REGULATING BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDED BY CABLE OPERATORS. NOTHING IN THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT GRANTS OF STATUS ALREADY TO USE STATE FRANCHISING TO REGULATE BROADBAND SERVICE CLEARLY STATED THE STATE IS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW. SB TWENTY EIGHT WOULD ALSO CREATE UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIAL DISRUPTION FOR EXISTING SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS WHICH ULTIMATELY BUT DID HER NOT ADVANCE TO BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY SB TWENTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE DIFFERENT FRANCHISEES TO DEPLOY INFRASTRUCTURE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING SERVICE AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL TO ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN OFFENSIVE BLOCK. NATION BLOC APPROACH CONFLICTS WITHOUT GIVE CONSERVATIVE I RECOMMEND IT TO THE P. 8% FILES OF GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT DO NOT ALIGN WITH HIM TO BLACKTOWN. ADDITIONAL EIGHT AND FUND CIRCUMSTANCES A COMPANY MAY NOT PROVIDE SERVICE IN EVERY PART OF A SENTENCE BLOCK WITHIN A DIFFERENT FRANCHISE SERVICE THE AREA. THERE ARE CASES WHERE DEPLOYMENT OF FACILITIES TO ENABLE SURVEYS HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS DO YOU CAN A DELAY IN OBTAINING NECESSARY PERMITS. AN ADVOCATE DISABILITIES PASSED THROUGH A FENCE IS BLOCKED IN ORDER TO REACH AN ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER IN ANOTHER AREA AND ARE NOT ENGINEERED. TO PROVIDE RESIDENTIAL SERVICE. SB TWO EIGHT IS ALL NOT TECHNOLOGY. A VARIETY OF BLOOD PROVIDERS OFFER. CAL LIKE WHY ARE. THAT OP WITH IDEA DIFFERENT. BETWEEN EIGHT IMPOSE NEW MAY ONLY DEXTER FRANCHISEES ESTABLISHING DIFFERENTIAL REGULATORY TREATMENT AMONG COMPETING PROVIDERS THAT IS UNFAIR AND WOULD ACT AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO MARKET FORCES THAT HAVE GENERATED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BROADBAND NETWORK INVESTMENT IN RECENT YEARS. THIRTY THREE CC TA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES SB TWENTY EIGHT AT THE NON LAWFUL EXPANSION OF DEATH PASSED THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE STATE'S GOAL TO EXPAND BROADBAND. ACCESS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

MEXICO MEDICAL BORDERLINE OF FOURTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. FOURTEEN AUBURN YES YES. THANK YOU FOR OUR TOWN OUR CHOICE WE DO OPPOSE THE BILL FOR THIS- ISSUE BROUGHT UP BY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE DOES HAVE A PLATE FAIR PLAYING FIELD AND THAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOT GIVE EXTRA ADVANTAGES TO THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY WHICH IS THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT BUT- CERTAIN ALL YOUR INTENT PLEASE STATE YOUR THOSE POINTS WERE MADE SO JUST PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME YOUR AFFILIATION AND YOUR AND YOUR POSITION. ON THE BILL AND THAT'S FOR ALL THE SPEAKERS PLEASE. CERTAINLY WE NEED BETTER WHY WORK SO DRAW. THANKS SPEAKER PLEASE. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY WILL COME NOW TO- THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY DISCUSSION ANY MEMBERS. WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS MEASURE. THAT AND AGAIN- CENTER COUPLE YET I JUST WANNA- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE COMMITMENTS. OKAY YOU WANT TO SPEAK- WE DIDN'T HEAR YOU SO MAKE SURE THAT- CENTERS MIKE IS ON WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR SERVERS TO CENTER EGGMAN A CENTER GROVE. AND THEN CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU SPENT A CAREER FOR WORKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT'S- RELEVANT AND MY DISTRICT AS WELL ONE OF THE ISSUES I HAVE ADDRESSED SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE AND IN TWO HOUSES NOW IS THE CONTINUED- ASSIGNMENT OF MORE AND MORE THINGS TO THE- PCCP YOU SEE. AND THEN WE BRING THEM IN AND YELL AT THEM FOR NOT. DOING ENOUGH AND YET WE CONTINUE TO GIVE THE MORE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT. IS THERE AN IDEA OF EXPANSION OF THE OF THEM RIGHT I KNOW YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS REALLY GOING TO INCREASE THEIR WORKLOAD IN WAYS AS WE KNOW WE'RE JUST PASSING MORE THINGS ON WHILE. COULD BE A LOT MORE THINGS FOR THEM TO BE LOOKING AT CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PC AND THE IMPACT ON THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION THE I. THIS THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS LANGUAGE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON VERY DILIGENTLY WITH THIS SI PC. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MADE SENSE THAT THEY HAD THE CAPABILITY THEY ARE ALREADY REVIEWING LICENSEES ON A REGULAR TEN TEN YEAR CYCLE BASIS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT- THE DATA THAT THEY'RE BEING GIVEN IS REALLY INSUFFICIENT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO- TAKE THE ACTION TO DENY A LICENSE. BUT THE FRANCHISE LICENSE- IT IS THIS LIKELY TO GIVE THE MORE WORK I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR MORE DATA WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE REVIEWING MORE DATA- AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO ALSO. HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IN REGARDS TO HOW THAT FRANCHISEE HAS DONE IN THEIR PARTICULAR DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE. THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION. YOU CAN MAKE A COMPLAINT BUT THERE'S NO BASIS UPON WHICH THEY CAN ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION OR- OR DENY A GIVEN THIS THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE'VE WE'VE CONSTRUCTED SO. MY GUESS IS THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE WORK- AND DAD- IN THAT AND THAT TELLS TO. WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THEIR BUDGET IN ORDER TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT. THANK YOU I WOULD JUST CONTINUE TO CAUTION THIS COMMITTEE- THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE AMOUNT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO BEFORE WE BRING THEM IN AND ALL OF THEM FOR NOT DOING THEIR JOB ADEQUATELY. THANK YOU. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR QUESTION AUTHOR IS THAT POSSIBLE. YES I AM MEMBER DOWNTURN QUESTIONS THANK YOU- ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT THE C. P. UC'S EXPANSION OF CABLE- OVER. THE CABLE FRANCHISING AUTHORITY THAT IS FEDERALLY PREEMPTED LIKE THE NOW SUGGESTS THAT I HAVE SHOWS THAT THIS CONFLICTS WITH FEDERAL LAW. WELL I THINK- LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT WE HAVE A VERY CAREFULLY CRAFTED THE LANGUAGE. SO THAT WE AVOID ANY FEDERAL PREEMPTION- AND- WE THIS ACTUALLY IS VERY SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. AND YOUR YOU HEARD- KIMBERLY VALIDEA'S TALK ABOUT HOW SHE'S GOING TO SCHOOL IN NEW YORK AND SHE CAN ACCESS INTERNET ALMOST ANYWHERE. IN NEW YORK STATE THEY EVEN SET UP A STRUCTURE FOR THEIR- THEIR ENTITY- TO- ASK FOR THE SAME KIND OF INFORMATION WE'RE ASKING FOR SO I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT PREEMPTION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE VERY CAREFULLY CRAFTED THIS SO THAT WE DON'T STEP. ON TO THE TOES OF THE OF THE FEDERAL PREEMPTION ON THIS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS DATA WE'RE NOT TELLING THEM WORK WE'RE NOT TELLING THEM HOW MUCH THEY CAN CHARGE- WHERE THERE'S A THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PREAMPS AND WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE WE'RE BEING VERY CLEAR. ABOUT HOW WHAT KIND OF DATA WE WANT. HOW THEY DETERMINE. WHO GET SERVICE AND WHO DOES NOT GET SERVICE SO THAT WE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER REDLINING IS GOING ON AND WHETHER COMMUNITIES POOR COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR ARE BEING EXCLUDED BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY IT'S NOT ECONOMICALLY- ED ADVANTAGEOUS IN OTHER WORDS THAT THERE THAT THE COMPANIES ARE ARE NOT INCLUDING. COMMUNITIES THAT- CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE HIGHER RATES THAT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE ASKED FOR SOME REAL SPECIFIC INFORMATION FROM THE COMPANIES THAT WILL ALLOW THE C. P. U. C. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT THAT'S IN FACT HAPPENING AND IF THAT'S THE CHARGE OF THE CPUC RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE GIVEN THE CPUC THIS CHARGE BUT WITHOUT ANY. ANY ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GET THE DATA THAT THEY NEED- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. THANK YOU HAVE A ONE MORE QUESTION CC TA HAS A- CONCERN THAT IT COULD LIMIT INVESTMENT FOR BROADBAND. I'M IN A LOT OF OUR RULES CAN RULE COMMUNITIES DO YOU HAVE THAT SAME CONCERNED AND IF YOU- DO YOU ARE YOU ADDRESSING THAT WITH THEM. COULD SPEAK INTO THE MIKE OF SORRY ARE YOU ADDRESSING THAT WITH THEM. SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH EVERYONE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT IS. THAT IS VERY CLEAR IS THAT. IN ORDER TO PUT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS LIKE- ELECTRICITY BACK IN THE DAY. THERE WERE WHOLE COMMUNITIES IT DIDN'T RECEIVE ELECTRICAL SERVICE BECAUSE THEY WERE RURAL ISOLATED AND DIDN'T- HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. AND WHAT WHAT WE DID AS A COUNTRY'S WE MADE A INVESTMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT- PEOPLE EVERYWHERE AND IN PARTICULAR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING. IN OUR IN THE BROADBAND SECTOR AS WELL. WHAT WE KNOW IT'S WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO- USE OUR RESOURCES WHETHER THAT THE CASF. WHETHER IT'S A FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT- THAT THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS IT MAY BE APPROPRIATED. OR WHETHER WE'RE USING- THE DOLLARS THAT WE GET. IS IT PANDEMIC WHICH CAN BE USED FOR BROADBAND AS WELL WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WE JUST NEED TO HAVE THE DATA TO KNOW WHERE THEY WERE THOSE INVESTMENTS GOING TO BE AND CAN WE INCREASE COMPETITION BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MOM AND POP. INTERNET COMPANIES THAT WANT TO GET INTO-THE MARKET AND CAN'T BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE'VE STRUCTURED% OUR OUR INTERNET- FRENCH I SERVICES SO I THINK MORE COMPETITION IS A GOOD THING. BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE INTERNET COMPANIES IN ORDER TO. TO GET THE LAST REMAINING 2% OR TWO MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE NED A CONNECTED TO THE TO THE INTERNET. THANK YOU. TERRAVIA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO KNOWLEDGE THE CONCERNS OF SOME OF THE CALLERS AT THE OPPOSITION AND I APPRECIATE THAT- BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR JUST STATED THAT SHE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND I KNOW THA IT'S NEEDED I KNOW RURAL COMMUNITIES FUNCTION VERY DIFFERENTLY IF YOU COULD PLEASE SPEAK INTO THE MIKE BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU SORRY. I SAID I WANTED TO SIGNAL ITS THE COMMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S CONCERNS BUT I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE AUTHOR STATED THAT SHE'S STILL WORKING WITH US STAKEHOLDERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO HI THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I KNOW THAT COMING FROM AN URBAN COMMUNITY AYE YOU KNOW WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES AND RURAL COMMUNITY SO I WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR A OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD SELL WHEN APPROPRIATE. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE TO LOOKS UP THAT MOTION AND THE MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS AND REFER. TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION. WHERE THE AMENDMENTS. TO THIS BILL THAT THE- AUTHORS ACCEPTED. WOULD BE WRITTEN. INTO THE BILL DUE TO SOME TIME CONSTRAINTS. SO- WE'LL ACCEPT THAT OUR MOTION. AND IF THERE ARE ANY MORE COMMENTS- CENTER CALORIES YOU WANNA MAKE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I AM I APPRECIATE ALL THE QUESTIONS- NO TAT I. I WORKED VERY HARD ON MY BILLS AND I AND I WORK VERY HARD WITH THE OPPOSITION I'D LIKE TO GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY- AND ISSUE. OF EQUITY. WHEN YOU HAVE PARTS OF OUR STATE A LARGE PART OF OUR STATE. THAT DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET. HI SPEED INTERNET IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO BUSINESS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR SCHOOL STUDIES.

ON ITEM NUMBER THREE SB SIX SIX TWO FOUR CENTER ARCHULETA. THE BILL REFERRING TO ENERGY TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. HYDROGEN WELCOME SENATOR AND PLEASE- BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. HE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WITH SO I AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO. SENATE BILL SIX X. TWO VERY IMPORTANT BILL HAND TAKES THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS ALLOWING UTILITY INVESTMENT IN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. AS MENTIONED THIS BILL ALLOWS INVESTOR OWNED GAS UTILITIES TO INVEST IN THE DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE OF HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION FUEL IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION. BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED MEASUREMENTS ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. AND COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS UP TO WORK OUT ANY REMAINING ISSUES. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN IT MARKED A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT. IN HOW THE SENATE. AND THE STATE WOULD INVEST IN ELECTRIFYING OUR ROADS. AND FAX SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY MANDATED THAT ELECTRICAL INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES INVEST IN THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PLUG IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES HOWEVER. NO PROGRAM EXIST FOR INVESTMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES LIKE ALL ELECTRIC VEHICLES USED ELECTRICITY. TO POWER AN ELECTRIC MOTOR. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST OTHER ELECTRIC VEHICLES FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES PRODUCE ELECTRICITY BY USING A FUEL CELL POWERED BY HYDROGEN RATHER THAN DRAWING ELECTRICITY FROM ONLY A BATTERY. HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE STILL AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. BUT FOR THE TECHNOLOGY JOB GROW CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO FOCUS ON TWO MAIN PRIORITIES BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE OF HYDROGEN FUEL AND MAKING HYDROGEN FUEL MORE READILY AVAILABLE. THIS BILL SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO WHAT DIRECTLY ACCOMPLISH THE SECOND GOAL BY MAKING HYDROGEN MORE READILY AVAILABLE. BY ALLOWING GAS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO BEGIN TO INVEST IN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN BEGIN TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN HARD TO ELECTRIFY FOR EXAMPLE BUS OR TRUCK FLEET SUPPORT SHIPS AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY SECTORS. SOME CONCERNS WERE BROUGHT UP HEADING INTO THIS COMMITTEE AND I HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS RESOLVING THEIR CONCERNS. AS MENTIONED. EARLIER THESE CONCERNS ARE REP REFERENCES PAYCHECKS OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THEM ONCE AGAIN. IT MEMBERS ACCEPTED TODAY WILL REMOVE HYDROGEN FROM THE TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION DEFINITION RELAX ANY MANDATES ON INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS OPTIONAL. EVENT COST SHIFTING SO ONLY PEOPLE OR ENTITIES THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD PAY FOR THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PREVENT ANY PROJECTS TO BE APPROVED THAT WOULD CAUSE A NET INCREASE IN EMISSIONS FROM THE ENERGY SECTOR AT THE TURMAN BY THE STATE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AS THESE AMENDMENTS WE BELIEVE WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADDRESSED THE MAJORITY OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOW GAS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO INVEST IN HYDROGEN DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. IF IT WILL HAVE A DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE TAXPAYERS INVOLVED. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN FOR THESE REGIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. I HAVEN'T KIMSA SEEN BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN STATES HYDROGEN ALLIANCE AND ROCKSTAND BAKER MADDIE. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WESTERN STATES HYDROGEN ALLIANCE BOTH ARE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH THE SPEAKERS I JUST WANNA REMIND. THE SPEAKERS SO WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE SAME ROLE TO THIS BILL THAT BOTH SIDES- SUPPORT OPPOSITION. ARE LIMITED TO.

AND YOUR EMPLOYMENT. APPLICATIONS THAT HIGH. EUROPEAN SERVICE AS BEING YOUNGER MAGICALLY CALIFORNIA CLEAN TRANSIT BOLEH HOWEVER UNDER TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION THE REPAIRS WOULD NOT BENEFIT. IT WAS MORE EFFECTIVE GREAT EXPANSION WE HAD NO CREDIT REPORTING HIGHER G. CARBONITE WE EVEN THOUGH IF IT WERE CHEAPER AND MORE OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT TO DO SO. ADDITIONAL INTRIGUING STAND SOON ALL TRANSPORTATION MUST BE ELECTRIFIED AT ALL LIKE YOU'RE BUYING CLOTHES MUST BE SERVED BY THE BRIDGE AND THAT REPAIRS MUST PAY THE ISLAND IS THE BUILDING. OR STRUCTURE. THE JUDGE IN THE CARPENTRY CARE YOU'RE MAKING. OBSOLETE THE SURVEY ALTERNATIVES AS FAST WHERE THEY CAN BE BECAUSE- ASSEMBLY PUBLIC. BREAK TRANSIT TRANSPORT MORE EFFICIENT MORE ALIVE. I MEAN SHE'S FREE SB BY ALLOWING THAT. DISTRIBUTION RATHER THAN BUILD WHERE IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE RATE. BURGER KING THE SUPPORT SIX SIXTY YOU.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION THIS REPORT SHE- THANK YOU NOW WE WILL MOVE TO ME BY MOHAMMED.

BUT NOT JUST SIMPLY AVOIDING EMISSION INCREASES THANKS FOR TO THE AMENDMENTS. WHEN THEY COME FORWARD THANK YOU. FOR I YOU NEXT BAKER. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU BRING IT DOWN TO THE COMMITTEE THIRDS ANYONE LIKE TO SPEAK WITH THE BEGIN WITH CENTER GROVE FOLLOWED BY CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE COST- CALIFORNIA REPAIRS- DO YOU HAVE THAT SAME CONCERN AND IF SO HOW ARE YOU ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WHEN WE BEGIN THE NEXT LEVEL OF. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT CLEAN AIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO ON- YES TO BE COSTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME REMEMBER THIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION WITH THE WITH THIS TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND HYDROGEN. NOT A BLANKET OF FEET AS WE DID WITH ELECTRICITY SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THIS GO ROUND BECAUSE WE LEARNED THAT THE BEST WAY TO GO FORWARD WITH ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS TO ALWAYS GIVE. THE CONSUMER THE OPTION AND THIS IS WHAT DONE AND IF MY- SUPPORTERS WOULD LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON THAT. IF THERE'S ANYTHING THEY'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. THEY'RE STILL ON THE LINE YEAH- THANK YOU SENATOR- WE HAVE SEEN FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FOR HYBRID AND THE STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY WHERE LARGE FLEETS ARE CONCERNED IF YOU LOOK AT ELECTRIFICATION BUT LOOKING AT THE OVERLAP OF BEING BLACK OR TERMINAL OPERATORS TRENDING IN THE. MARKETS ARE COMPLETE ALL COMMENTS- HYDROGEN THE MORE BRING COMMON TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE THE CHEAPER BECOME THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. H. AND S. ARE ACTUALLY SAYS. DISTRICTS OPTIONS SET OVERALL THIRTY DAY AND SHE THE OPTION THAT'S GOING EFFECTIVE AND MORE EFFECTIVE FOR RATE PAYERS GIVING THAT OPTIONALITY CAN ONLY DECREASE THE COST. OF GOING TO YOUR CAR. THANK SIR. OKAY WE'LL GO TO OUR CENTER GONZALEZ. S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW WE JUST HAD ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY EARLIER TODAY IN WHICH WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HYDROGEN AS WELL AND I KNOW YOU'RE- YOU'RE VERY MUCH I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT WE- INCLUDE THAT IN THE LARGE PORTFOLIO OF OPTIONS FOR- OUR EMISSIONS GOALS BUT I DO SHARE THE CONCERN OF- SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AS WELL IN TERMS OF JUST. A NET INCREASE- THE RESULTS IN THE NEXT INCREASE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE REDUCTIONS BEING MADE ESPECIALLY NEAR OUR PORTS IN WHICH I REPRESENT TO ME WITH THERE'S A LOT- OF EMISSIONS AS WE KNOW IN AND AROUND OUR PORTS THROUGH OUR COMMUNITIES AND I WOULD JUST LIKE LIKE TO SEE THAT HAVE THAT SORT OF HYDROGEN. IT REALLY WORKS AT REDUCING- VERSES JUST RESULTING IN A NET INCREASE SO WITH THAT'LL SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU AS WELL AS CHURCH TRANSPORTATION THANK YOU SENATOR IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT I MENTIONED IS BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE OF HYDROGEN. MAKING SURE THAT HYDROGEN IS IT MORE READILY AVAILABLE AND ALLOWING US TO GO FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA TO SET THE STAGE ACROSS THE NATION FOR SENATORS ARE YOU'LL HAVE YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO CLOSE TO MAYBE YOU% CAN MAKE THOSE TO YOUR CLOSING STATEMENTS BUT FIRST I WANTED TO GET A MOTION. ON THE RECORD AND- YOU DID MENTION THAT YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS YES SIR AND THAT WERE ASKING IN A BEDROOM A MOTION BE MADE AS TO DO PASS UP AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IF WE CAN HAVE THAT CENTER BACK REALLY PUSH IT THAT VERY AHEAD OF WHAT DID YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT OR DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK BUT WHEN HE SPEAKS ARE. OKAY DID WE HAVE ANY ALL I WANT I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK. OFTEN ON. OKAY SO SOON AS WE SPEAK- TO. WANNA MAKE THAT MOTION. OKAY WILL COME. AFTER CENTER BACK BACK SPEAKS BAKER. GREAT I TWENTY I THE AUTHOR'S CHANGE CLARIFY THAT THE- CAUSES HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE CANNOT-BE COLLECTED FROM THE RETAIL NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS AND OTHER ENSURE ASSURANCES THAT THE- BIG THE INTENT OF THE HUNDRED OF ESTIMATES SUPPORT. TRUCKING AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION- REALLY THAT'S IN N MY MIND THE BEST APPLICATION- RATHER THAN TRYING TO BUILD. PACWEST EVERY GAS STATION AND IN CALIFORNIA- I AM JUST WANTED TO COMMENT AGAIN ON THE HYDROGEN ITSELF IF WE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT. THE BILL OUT OF HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THERE WAS ALSO MAKE SURE THE HYGIENIST SELF WHAT WILL LOWER EMISSIONS SO. A PLAN TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY A TO HELP MOVE FORWARD BUT WANT TO RAISE THESE CONCERNS I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND SO WE WILL ACCEPT THE MOTION NOW FROM SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU AND- I JUST WANTED MY OWN LITTLE COMMENTS IN TERMS OF THE DISCUSSION IT WAS REYES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A- IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM SO. ABOUT THIS BILL. THERE YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF LEGISLATION THAT WE PASSED OVER THE YEARS THAT ALLOWED BECAUSE SHIPS ARE RATE PAYERS. PROFESSIONALLY ELECTRIFY ELECTRIFICATION OF THE GRID AND SOLAR THERE BUT NOT A CONSCIOUS SAID ABOUT PASSED ON TO REACH RATEPAYERS. THIS BILL IS NOT ONE OF THEM THIS BILL WE ADDED AMENDMENT THE- AUTHOR ACCEPTED A BILL. THAT WOULD PREVENT A COST SHIPS IRWIN- THE A BILL THE SUPPLIED ANOTHER THING RELATED TO HYDROGEN. DO YOU KNOW HOW COMING UP WITH A COMPETITOR POLICY YEAR HERE CALIFORNIA TO SPUR HYDROGEN WOULD MEAN WE'D SEE MORE INVESTMENT DOLLARS COMING INTO OUR STATE TO SPUR THE THESE JOBS SO THIS IS. A NET POSITIVE THE GAIN OF FIVE DOLLARS COMING INTO OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY TO MAKE- HYDROGEN THE COMPETITIVE AND THERE IS ALREADY PLENTY PLENTY OF ANALYSIS THAT THE- THAT SHOWS THAT ONCE A HYDROGEN STARTS EXPAND THE PROP THE- THE COST OF HYDROGENS CODE IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN IN THE FUTURE. AND SAVE RATEPAYERS MONEY IN COMPARISON TO OTHER- COMPETITIVE- OF GREEN ENERGY SO THIS THIS WILL BE A AN INDUSTRY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY OUT COMPETE ALMOST ANY OTHER GREEN ENERGY SO THIS IS SOMETHING. WORTH LOOKING OUT FOR A REPAIR SIX AND THE THEIR FUTURE TO POCKET CLEANER FUEL AT A CHEAPER PRICE SO- I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING FORWARD TO SPILL IN TAKING THIS ON AS A CHALLENGE. THAT AND HIS GOOD WORK ON THIS BILL IN ITS ABILITY WORK VERY WELL WITH OUR STAFF I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH OF CENTER TO LETTER DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS OF MATURITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND WE ARE READY TO CLOSE AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH.

CENTER GONZALEZ BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON- BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGES SEVEN THROUGH EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS THESE AMENDMENTS TO THE FOLLOWING THE UPGRADE BUILD UP SPEED REQUIREMENTS FROM TWENTY FIVE THREE TO ONE HUNDRED DOWN TWENTY UP THANK YOU AT A YEARLY CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE COLLECTED AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND ADD A SUNSET DATE OF TEN YEARS REMOVED SECURITIZATION ADJUSTS THE HIGH POVERTY DEFINITION. AND ADDS FAIR GROUNDS AS AN ELIGIBLE ENTITY FOR THESE GRANTS AS WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- EMERGENCIES WERE FOR FAIRGROUNDS OF NEEDED- THIS SERVICE I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB FOUR WHICH IS A CRITICAL MEASURE TO HELP CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS WE ALL KNOW ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA BROADBAND COUNCIL 23% OF CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING UNITS HOME TO EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION RESIDENTS DON'T HAVE A BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTION THE REPORT ADDITIONALLY FOUND THAT ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS LACK HIGH SPEED BROADBAND WITH THREE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND RESIDING IN URBAN AREAS ACROSS THE STATE WERE SEE EXAMPLES OF HOW THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS PREVENTING CALIFORNIANS FROM ENGAGING IN CRITICAL DIGITAL ACTIVITIES. WHETHER IT IS GOING TO HAVE STUDENTS GO TO A TACO BELL AS WE'VE SEEN WITH SENATOR KENNEDY I DON'T HAVE I GET AWAY SHE MENTIONED THEY WERE DOING THEIR HOMEWORK THROUGH WIFI ACCESS AT TACO BELL IN SALINAS OR OLDER CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE FAST ENOUGH INTERNET TO RECEIVE TELEHEALTH SERVICES FAMILIES SMALL BUSINESSES WE'VE SEEN IT ALL THIS BILL REDEFINED THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND TO ENABLE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO BE BUILT IN UNSERVED AREAS. THE CHANGE WILL HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. OF ALL SIZES TO APPLY FOR GRANTS IN A- INTO PERCENT. INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN MEET CALIFORNIANS FUTURE NEEDS. IT'LL STABILIZE THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE ADVANCED SERVICES FUND BY EXTENDING THE SUNSET ON THE SURCHARGE FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS WILE ALLOWING ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR THREE REIMAGINE FEET ASSESSMENT. ON ALL ACCESS LINES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS A SIMILAR FORMULA TOWARDS THE STING NINE ONE ONE SURCHARGE THIS CHANGE WILL ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S ONLY SOURCE OF. FUNDING FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE DOES NOT DISAPPEAR. THIS IS A SUPPORTED BY A DIVERSE COALITION OF OVER ONE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS. INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES EDUCATION ADVOCATES LABOR LEADERS SMALL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND MANY MORE. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY HAVE ERNESTO FUND COHEN.

ACTUALLY FIVE CHARLIE SERVICER DOLLY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAMES ARE NOT THE PHONE I AM THAT SEAMLESS OF COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION ALSO KNOWN AS THE AT BAT. MY RESEARCH FOR THIS ORGANIZATION HAS FOCUSED ON HOW WE BUILD TWENTY FIRST CENTURY READY BROADBAND ACCESS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. HOW WE AVOID MAKING THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST THAT HAVE GIVEN US THE DIGITAL DIVIDE UP TODAY. AND I DAY DOES MY BOYS COMMITTEE BEFORE FIBER IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL FUTURE READY BROADBAND ACCESS WHETHER WIRELESS OR WIRED WITHOUT EXCEPTION. SB FOUR MAKES IMPORTANT PROGRESS TOWARDS PUSHING FIBER INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH TWO CORE PROGRAMS- BOND PROGRAM FOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE UPDATED GRANT PROGRAM. I AM PROGRAMS CHANGES REFLECTS GOVERNOR NEWSOM EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT ALLOWS THE CPT TO ADJUST THE PROGRAM TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL DOLLARS SHOULD CONGRESS PASS PRESIDENT BIDEN ROBIN PLAN. TO BUILD FUTURE PROOF FIBRE INFRASTRUCTURE ALL AMERICANS. THE BILL'S BOND FINANCING PROGRAM WOULD ENABLE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN DELIVERING FIBRE INFRASTRUCTURE IN RURAL MARKET AND LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT THAT THERE'S A SHARE A STRONG COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNOR AND LEADERSHIP TO CREATE THE PUBLIC MODEL SOON. SO FOR NOW THE PROVISIONS BEING HER MOVEMENTS BEFORE TO BE INCORPORATED IN A LATER DATE. I HAVE BUT I CAN SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT WE CAN'T DELIVER TOWARD UNIVERSAL TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BY READY ACCESS BUT WE DO NOT INCLUDE- PUBLIC MODEL. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN CONCLUSION I WANT TO THANK SENATOR LENA GONZALEZ FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE PROVISION FOR THE STATE NOW SHARED BY THE PRESIDENT UNITED STATES FOR THE NATION.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MEASURE NOW I KNOW THAT- THE COVER NINETEEN THE PANDEMIC AS YOU KNOW SURELY HIGHLIGHTED THE DEFICIENCIES AND IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AS A PANDEMIC WITHIN A PANDEMIC AND I KNOW MAY SEEM INSENSITIVE TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THOSE TERMS BUT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S NOT NEARLY ALL IT'S NOT NEW TO OUR COMMUNITIES IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR A LONG TIME. AS A TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO TACKLE NOW- I THINK THAT THE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY SIX SINGLE HANDILY CAN DECIDE THE FUTURE OF OUR STUDENTS OF OUR KIDS THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY LET ALONE GLOBAL ECONOMY SO I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE GET AGGRESSIVE. AND FIGURE OUT THE SOLUTION AND AGAIN I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE OUR KIDS DESERVE BETTER YOU KNOW WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND YET WE CAN PROVIDE THE VERY BASIC IN NEED AND THAT'S BECOME A BASIC MEAT JUST LIKE FOOD AND WATER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR BAKER DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK. BUT NO JUST BOWED MOVED TO BUILT THE PROPERTY I'M- OKAY WELL WE HAVE SPEAKERS PRIOR TO THAT AND BEFORE WE MAKE THE MOTION I WANTED TO CLARIFY THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE SPEAK THEM. I'M IN A I'M IN A STATEMENT TO THE RECORD WILL GO TO SENATOR DOLLY CENTER GROVE DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK. YOU'LL BE NEXT AFTER CENTER CALLED. THANK YOU RICHARD MEMBERS I. REGRETFULLY HAVE TO STAND UP AND THEN I'M IN OPPOSE THE BILL AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR HAS. REACHED OUT TO ME LAST YEAR AND SHE'S DONE HER DON'T DO IT DON'T DO IT JUSTICE. AND RESPECT AND- BUT I WORKED ON SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE. MANY YEARS AGO AND WE ACTUALLY AS- AN INCREASE THE FONT AND EXTENDED THE- THE PROGRAM JUST AS THIS BILL. THAT DOES FOR A LONG TIME TEN YEARS. BUT I WILL I WILL SHARE WITH YOU. NOT ONE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. ACCESS THE FUNDS AND USE THEM. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. THEY THEY THEY SUPPORT THE COME ALONG SIDE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. I'M STILL IN THE SAME PLACE IN MY COMMUNITIES WITHOUT SERVICE. AND WITH THE PANDEMIC WE SOUGHT EVEN TAKE THAT EXACERBATED WISH WE COULD HAVE WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE HAVEN'T CHANGED. THE OUTCOME AND SO UNTIL I SEE SOME REAL LIKE WAYS TO GET TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT VERY SMALL POPULATION OUT THERE THERE'S 97% OF THE- OF THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS IT'S THAT LAST. TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OR 3% THAT DON'T GET THOSE SERVICES OVER COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY LIVE IN ONE. IT'S HORRIBLE IT IS NOT RIGHT AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING I THINK IT'S GOING TO PUT A LOT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM. BUT I'LL BE SURPRISED. IF ONE OF THOSE. FIGHTERS ARE ARE ARE BIG PROVIDERS THE VERIZON'S THE- SAID COMCAST THOSE FOLKS. ACCESS THESE FUNDS AND ACTUALLY BRING THOSE. SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITIES THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY AND CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TO HAVE TO RE GREATLY REGRETFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM BIEBER- BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE BEFORE ME IT SAYS THAT- CALIFORNIA'S GONNA HAVE A RECORD TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVE- FOR THIS BRAND THIS ACTIVITY AND- THE MONEY ISN'T BEING ACCESSED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT. THE OTHER ISSUES ARE IS IT TAKES FIFTY MILLION FIFTY SEVEN MILLION ACCESS LINES WHICH ARE- THE- LAND LINES PER SE WERE NOBODY USES LAND LINES ANYMORE EVERYBODY'S ON A CELL PHONE- AND IT ESTABLISHES IT- A TWENTY THREE PER. CENT CHARGE. BUT THAT'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONALLY EVERY YEAR SO I GUESS MY ISSUE IS THAT- DO YOU HAVE A PLANNERS OR ANYTHING WITH THIS TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS A RESERVE WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS IN RESERVE. AND THAT THE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT EVERY YEAR THAT IT THIS MEANT THIS BILL WILL GENERATE WHAT WILL WHICH IS- A RATE. INCREASE WHAT WILL THAT MONEY BE USED FOR. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR. YES CENTER CONSOLES WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT THE QUESTION SENATOR GROVE AND- YOU KNOW I'D LOOK THAT AT THIS VERY DIFFERENTLY I MEAN AFTER WE'VE SEEN THROUGH SIXTIES SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE THAT IT WAS ON A PERCENTAGE SYSTEM DIDN'T REALLY GET US TO THE SIXTY SIX MILLION PER YEAR THAT WE NEEDED IT WE ONLY WERE GETTING ABOUT FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IF THAT. WITH THIS BILL AND WITH THE- THE AMENDMENTS THAT I TOOK A THROUGH ENERGY COMMITTEE AND WAS GRATEFUL TO DO SO- WE'RE NOW ALLOWING THE P. YOU SEE THE FLEXIBILITY BUT AT A AT A FLAT FEE RATE BUT CAPPED AT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET THERE- EXPANDING THE LINES NOT JUST ON LAND LINES BUT ON CELL PHONES AS WELL VOICE OVER- SO THERE'S MORE ACCESS LINES THAT WERE TOUCHING THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO IT'S NOT JUST AFFECTING THE RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. PROVIDING THE REVENUE FOR THIS CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES SON BUT THEY'RE ALSO RECEIVING THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT HOPEFULLY WITH THIS NEW MODEL- SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS WHAT I THINK- WILL BE DIFFERENT IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE TWO TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS POTENTIALLY COULD COME TO CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE A STAND NOW AND REFORM OUR OUR FEES IN HOUSE. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION IT DOES AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER SAID YOUR DUE DILIGENCE ON THIS BILL- AND EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S- IT ADDRESSES THE INTENT OF WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO I GUESS WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN AGREEMENT THAT. YOU KNOW I STILL SEE THAT THERE'S TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVE- AND THAT'S FROM THE GOVERNOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE STATED THAT THE ADDITIONAL TAXES WERE NECESSARY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT- SO IT'S A TAX INCREASE VOTE FOR ANY OF US TO TAKE THIS VOTE IN THE TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THERE IT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW IF THEY'RE NOT SPENDING THAT MANY AT WHY WE SHOULD INCREASE COST HONOR. ALL YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS CELLPHONES AND YOU KNOW SERVICES IN ORDER TO PAY FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY TO GO INTO RESERVE ACCOUNT AND. ONCE YOU SEEN CENTER GROVE I'M NOT I'M NOT I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE- RESERVE THE- THE GENERAL FUND RESERVE THE TWENTY TWO BUILDINGS THAT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING REFERENCE TO ISSUE ANOTHER TWENTY TWO MILLION YOU'RE MAKING REFERENCE TO. AND IN ITS THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING BEING PROVIDED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STAYS PROJECTED TO HAVE A TO RECORD TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR RESERVE. WHAT YOU MEAN THE GENERAL FUND RESERVES THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT A RESERVE IN THIS SPECIFIC NO NOT IN THIS PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OKAY THERE'S A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR RESERVE. AND IF YOU HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN ALL OF US AGREE THAT WE NEED TO. YOU KNOW COVERT TAUGHT US THAT WE DO NEED TO. ADDRESS THE BROADBAND SITUATION AND ALL OF THAT THE PITFALLS THAT WE HAVE. WITH ANY TYPE OF AND COMMUNICATION ESPECIALLY IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. BUT I JUST DON'T SEE INCREASING TAXES ON INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING ESPECIALLY THROUGH COVERT OVER THE LAST TWENTY YOU KNOW. AT TWENTY FOUR TWELVE. YEAR AND THEN INCREASING TAXES. OKAY VERY WELL- WE SEE HERE DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE THAT WISHES TO SPEAK. SIR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I'M GONNA AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE BECOME THE MIKE SO WE CAN HEAR YOU. I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT JUST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- I. TWO ONE TO VOICE. SOME CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS. MEASURE I COMMAND THE AUTHOR IS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER STATED ON THE EFFORT TO. REALLY ADDRESS A SERIOUS PROBLEM- AS AN AUTHOR OF A SIMILAR BILL. IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN. TRYING TO ADDRESS. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT EXISTED AND ALL OF OUR PUBLIC HOUSING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I SECURED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE PUBLIC HOUSING FACILITIES ALL IN URBAN AREAS. WOULD BE WIRED FOR THE INTERNET OR CABLE UNFORTUNATELY THAT HASN'T COME. TO FRUITION IN MANY OF THESE AREAS SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR EXPANDING UPON THAT MAKING SURE THAT'S ACROSS. OUR PRIORITY- NOT% JUSTIN REUTERS BUT IN URBAN AS WELL BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN- VOICE BY MY COLLEAGUES AND RURAL AREAS BECAUSE- VERY RARELY. DO THEY GET TO SEE THE SERVICES THAT THEY GREATLY AND THEN BADLY NEED. AND WE'VE SEEN IT ONLY EXACERBATING SHOW ITSELF- THIS PANDEMIC- IN AREAS OF. DISSING LEARNING ONLINE LEARNING. THE NUMBER OF YOUNG KIDSWHO CANNOT ACCESS. THE INTERNET BECAUSE ONE- THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT THERE AND TO THE DEVICES DON'T EXIST BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS MET THE MEASURE BECAUSE AGAIN IT DOES- TARGET THOSE UNDERSERVED AREAS- MAKING SURE THAT- WE DO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND I'M GONNA- DIFFER WITH MY FRIEND FROM BAKERSFIELD. LANDLINES ARE STILL BEING USED I STILL HAVE A LAND LINE AND IN MY HOME AND IT IS THE BACKBONE TO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO BUT THE COPPER IS NOT BEING MAINTAINED AND I THINK WE DO HAVE TO PRIORITIZE AND MAKE SURE. THAT WE MAINTAIN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL SO ON THAT NOTE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE TODAY. I'M GONNA READ THE AMENDMENTS INTO THE RECORD JUST SO PEOPLE ARE ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THEY ARE- A BECAUSE THERE ARE SIX AMENDMENTS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE OF FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC. AND TO INFORM- I I'M- I KNOW THE MEMBERS- YES AT CENTER GROVE JUST ON A BRIEF RESPONSE MISTER CHAIR TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDINO WHO I JUST LOVE SERVING WITH HE ALSO CARRIES A BLACKBERRY. THANK YOU. OKAY SO- THE AMENDMENTS ARE OF THE FIRST. A AMENDMENT WOULD REMOVE THE REFERENCE 290% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE DIVISION IN IN THE DEFINITION OF A NOT UNDER UNSERVED AREA- THE SECOND AMENDMENT WOULD RAISE THE SPEED. OF THE C. A. S. F. FUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEGABITS OR THE FEDERAL FEET SPEED THRESHOLD WHICHEVER IS GREATER. THE THIRD AMENDMENT WOULD DELETE PROVISIONS SPECIFYING A CAP ACCESS LINE SURCHARGE AND INSTEAD ESTABLISH A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP ON THE TOTAL ANNUAL SURCHARGE REVENUES FOR THE CASF AND REMOVE PERMIT PROVISIONS OF EXISTING LAW THAT LIMIT THE CP IS HIS ABILITY TO CHANGE THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND SURCHARGE PROCESS. THE FOURTH AMENDMENT WOULD REMOVE THE BILL SECURITATE'S SECURITISATION PROVISIONS. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT WOULD ESTABLISH A SUNSET DATE OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY THIRTY TWO FOR THE CASF. AND THE LAST AMENDMENT WILL ALLOW THE CPUC TO USE A CASF TO FUND PROJECTS TO DEPLOY BROWN BUT TO. CERTAIN SPONSORED FACILITIES USE FOR LOCAL AND STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE INCLUDING FAIRGROUND SILVA FROM NOT MISTAKEN- CENTER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AMENDMENTS- SO COULD WE NOW ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO INCLUDE THOSE AMENDMENTS- CENTER DOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. THE SERVER GONZALEZ THE YOUR MAKE YOUR CLOSING STATEMENTS YEAH THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR I THINK BOTH YOU AND THE ENERGY COMMITTEE OF DEFINITELY MADE THIS BILL STRONGER SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR DILIGENCE WITH US TO OUR SPONSORS AND COLLEAGUES AS WELL AGAIN I'LL JUST SAY THIS IS OUR TIME AS CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO PUT OUR MARK AS IT PERTAINS TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND FINALLY CLOSE THAT AND IT IN THIS ONE SPACE. IT WILL PROMOTE COMPETITION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SMALLER ISPS ENSURE THAT UNSERVED COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN OUR RURAL CALIFORNIA AREAS GET- PRIORITY UPGRADES TO STANDARDS AT LEAST MEET THE FEDERAL LEVEL IF NOT MORE WHICH WE'VE DONE A THROUGH AMENDMENTS- AND EXTENDS THE CURRENT SPEED IT'S IN MY OPINION NOT A TAX BUT EXTENDING THE CURRENT SURCHARGE JUST MAKING SURE THAT WORKS FOR EVERY CALIFORNIANS SO WITH THAT I. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB FOUR BY SENATOR GONZALEZ TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. WESSEL HI WESEL EINE DOLLY. NO DOLLY GNOME BAKER HI BAKER I GORGEOUS. BRADFORD HI BRADFORD FINE DOT NINE DOT HI. EGGMAN HI EGGMAN I GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ HI. GROW HERTZBERG. MCGUIRE.

VERY WELL WILL HOLD THE ROLE OF INFRACTION MEMBERS WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PRESENTER CENTER DOT IF YOU CAN FOR PRESENT FROM YOUR DESK. ONE S. B. TWO TWO TWO FOLLOWED BY S. B. TWO TO THREE. BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY YES MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO- SB TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY TWO- THIS WOULD ESTABLISH THE WATER RATE ASSISTANCE FUND AND THE WATER READ ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. TO HELP PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR BOTH DRINKING WATER EXCUSE ME DRINKING AND WASTEWATER SERVICES TO LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS. I'LL BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE AUTHOR SUBMITS AS AUTHORS AMEND SKEWS ME- THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE CONSOLE FOR WORKING WITH MY TEAM- THOSE CHANGES. AS SOME OF YOU RECALL I AUTHORED LEGISLATION AB FOUR ONE ASKING THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF LOW INCOME WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THE SHORT VERSION OF THAT IS A LIRA- IN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE BOARD HAS DONE JUST THAT SB TWENTY TWO TAKES THE NEXT STEP OF MOVING FORWARD TO IT ACT IT ACT OUR WATER LIRA LOW INCOME WATER RESISTANCE IS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF S. B. TWO TWENTY TWO. IN ADDITION TO COMPLETING THE WATER LITERATE STUDY THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD RECENTLY SURVEYED HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY WATER SYTEMS AROUND THE STATE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WATER DEBT WATER SYSTEMS CUSTOMERS WORKS WERE ACCRUING. THE SURVEY RESULTS ARE SOBERING HERE'S SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF HOW SERIOUS THE PROBLEM OF WATER UNAFFORDABILITY HAS BECOME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR WATER BILLS THAT'S OVER THREE MILLION PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR CLEAN. SAFE DRINKING AND WASTEWATER. TWELVERS OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS HAVE DEAD OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IT MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THESE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE DEBT GREATER THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. COOLEY CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCRUED ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN WATER DEBT THAT NUMBER IS INCREASING AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PRE PANDEMIC OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE ALREADY LOST WATER SERVICES- DUE TO INABILITY TO PAY WATER BILLS. THE NUMBERS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC. GROWING WATER DEBT IS ALSO A PROBLEM FOR WATER SYSTEMS. FOR WATER SYSTEMS SOME WATER SYSTEMS HAVE LOST AS MUCH AS 30% OF THE REVENUE IN MORE THAN A HUNDRED THIRTY COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS ARE FACING FINANCIAL COLLAPSE DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PAY THEIR WATER BILLS. CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. NOT WITHSTANDING STATE POLICY THERE'S A STATE POLICY THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER THERE'S NO COMPARABLE WATER RESISTANCE PROGRAM FOR PUBLICLY OWNED AND WATER. PUBLICLY OWNED A COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE HAVE A STATE WIDE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR DRINKING AND WASTEWATER. THAT'S TO BE AMENDED SB TWO TWO TWO LAYS OUT THREE CATEGORIES OF ASSISTANCE INCLUDING DIRECT WATER BILL ASSISTANCE AND WATER CRISIS ASSISTANCE. THE BILL REQUIRES THE BOARD TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION IN EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE FUNDING NEEDS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS IDENTIFIED ANY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE RATES AS PROGRAM THAT IS A PARALLEL CONVERSATION- THAT IS OCCURRING BUT IT NEEDS TO OCCUR. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED SOME ONE TIME FUNDING AND MEGAN SOON BUT WE NEED A CONTINUING SOURCE OF STATE AND PRIVATE FUNDING AS WELL. GOODFAITH NEGOTIATIONS BEEN TAKING PLACE BETWEEN THE STAKEHOLDERS OF MY TEAM. WHILE THE AMENDMENTS HAVE ADDRESS SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS I KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE TO WORK ON IT I'M ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT. WHAT I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE TO ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS AND GET HIS LONG OVERDUE PROGRAM ESTABLISH ONE FINAL NOTE. I WANT TO THANK ACW EIGHT C.

A IS CINDY TOOK ON THE LINE. YES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SIR HUESO AND MEMBERS CINDY TACK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES OUR MEMBERS ARE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES AN AWKWARD HAS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB TWO TWO TWO. WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT SAID SENATOR DODD MADE IN THE APRIL FIVE CHRISTIAN BUT WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AS YOU KNOW. THIS EVENING I WILL NOTE THREE ISSUES- FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH PRIORITY BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS ASKS THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PRIORITY AND WE SUGGEST THAT THE PRIORITY ON WATER AFFORDABILITY SHOULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO PROVIDE ONE TIME STATE FUNDING FROM THE BUDGET SURPLUS AND SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL. TO HELP PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES ADDRESS THE CUSTOMER WATER DEBT THAT HAS ACCRUED DURING THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC EMERGENCY. THAT'S THE FIRST POINT SECOND ISSUE- NOW FOCUSED ON THE BILL ITSELF HAS TO DO WITH THE SCOPE OF SB TWO TO TWO AND WE AGREE WITH SENATOR DODD THAT THERE COULD BE AN ATTRACTIVE AND EFFICIENT WATER LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR LIRE FOR SHORT. IT IS DRAFTED SB TWO TWO TWO GOES BEYOND A LEE OR PROGRAMS WITH THE INCLUSION OF OTHER PROPOSALS AND A SHORT SOMETIMES IS- VERY HORT PREFERENCES BUT IN ON PAGE THREE PAGE FIVE PAGE PAGE SIX THERE'S DIFFERENT. REFERENCES TO OTHER PROPOSALS. AND WE SEE THAT CREATING A LEANER PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO A LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER. THAT ALONE IS A BIG LIST AND THE SCOPE OF THE BILL SHOULD BE NARROWED TO THAT. THAT'S OUR OUR SECOND COMMENT TODAY AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH A GREAT DATA AND THE WAY THE BILL IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IT PROPOSES TO HAVE THE STATE COLLECT TO RATE AND BOUNDARY DATA FROM EACH OF THE THOUSANDS OF PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. WE ASK YOU WHY IS IT PROPOSING TO DO THAT AND THE SPONSORS TOLD US THAT THE PROPOSAL IS FAIR FOR DETERMINING HOW MUCH OF THE BENEFIT HOUSEHOLD WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE PROGRAM. AND WE THINK THAT SORTING RATE DATA FROM EACH OF THOUSANDS OF SYSTEMS IS UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED WAY TO DEVELOP WHAT THE BENEFIT IS FOR HOUSEHOLDS IN THE PROGRAM. SO WE SUGGEST DELETING THAT PART OF THE BILL IT'S AT PAGE. EIGHT NINE NINE TO ELEVEN AND TAKING A SIMPLE APPROACH AND SETTING THE BENEFIT AND THAT WOULD AVOID UNNECESSARY FUND ADMINISTRATION COSTS SO THAT MORE OF THE FUNDING. CAN GO TO HELP LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY AND ARE QUICKLY SHIFTS THE TIME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE- THIS EVENING THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. THERE ARE NO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY OR IN ROOM ONE. TWELVE SO WE WILL MOVE TO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION OF TWO TWO TWO ONE PHONE LINES MODERATOR PLEASE Q. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWO TO TWO. AND WE ASK THE SPEAKERS TO LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS OF THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE. FOUR COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO S. B.

HELLO MORE WORK TO DO BUT GLAD WE'RE GETTING YOU. CLOSER TO YOUR GOAL SARGANT GONZALEZ. JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TO SENATOR DODD FOR BRINGING- BOTH THIS BILL AS WELL AS AS B. TWO TWO THREE EIGHT HAPPY COLE AUTHOR AND- LOOK FOR TO PUSHING THIS THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE THIS IS MUCH NEEDED THANK YOU. GRAYSON- EGGMAN. THANK YOU AB. AND I APPECIATE YOUR TENACITY WITH THIS CENTER DIED AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THE STATE CALIFORNIA HASN'T FIGURED THIS OUT YET BUT WE ARE SO LONG PASSAGE EMBARRASSING WE HAVEN'T FIGURED THIS OUT. THAT SAID I DON'T THERE'S STILL NO WAY TO PAY FOR THIS IN HERE AND SO I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUNDING SOURCE- THREE STILL HAVE CONCERNED AT SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS ARE SMALL AND AT RISK OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVE SO I THINK WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO ON ON THAT- BUT I CERTAIN THE FORTY SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND MOVING MOVING THIS ALONG AND WITH YOU REMAIN- DETERMINED TO GET THIS ISSUE SOLVED. SENATE DALY IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK. THANK YOU MISTER I GOT A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR FOR ME. SO I REPRESENT. HUNDREDS OF VERY SMALL- TWENTY SERVICE DISTRICTS THAT SUPPLY WATER IN WATER AND I GET CALLS IN A LOT DURING CODE WE GOT A LOT OF CALLS ABOUT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS PAYMENTS THE LIKES. AND KNOWING THAT WE'RE UP AGAINST PROP TO EIGHTEEN SO MANY TIMES THEY PUT UP OF A BALL- THE VOTE TO RAISE THEIR RATES NOT ONLY JUST BECAUSE- THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NON PAYING BUT THEY ALSO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN REGULATED ON TOP OF THEM. SO I'M TRYING TO GRASP WHAT THE HOW THIS WOULD WORK I MEAN IT AT THE END OF THE DAY. LOOK WE ALL WANT TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE DOWN AND OUT AND HAVE HAVE. DUE TO COVERT OR WHAT ARE THE EVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. BUT I REPRESENT I'M JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT BIEBER WERE ACTUALLY. IS A COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT. THAT HAS BEEN REGULATED BY THE SAFE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS SIGMA NOW AS WELL. AND I HAVE OF A COMMUNITY OF VERY POOR PEOPLE. THAT LITERALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO RAISE THE RATES SO THAT WHEN THEY TRY TO. PASS THE RATE UP TO ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF THE- THE THINGS THEY NEED TO MAKE THE WATER SAFE AND TO FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S AGING AND ME MY COMMUNITIES I MEAN. SOME OF THE SYSTEMS ARE. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEARS OLD THEIR STEEL PIPES THERE'S ROSTERS LEAKAGE. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO FIX THAT AND THAT BUT THE CUSTOMERS NEVER RAISE THE RATE. AND SO. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOMEIT FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS. WOULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO OPERATE THE SYSTEMS- AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE I'M I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET THERE. ASSEMBLY WHO'S VERY FRUSTRATED. WITH TE PROCESS OF TWO EIGHTEEN AND NOT ALLOWING. THEM TO BE ABLE TO FIX THEIR OWN SERVICES. PER SHARE THE- CENTER FROM BIEBER'S COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THIS BILL SIMPLY PUT ONLY SET UP AN ACCOUNT IN THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO DEPOSIT MONEY AND FOR YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL MONEY THIS COMING A- AND- ALSO- NONPROFIT MONEY THERE'S A LOT OF NON PROFITS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES ARE VERY. INTERESTED IN THESE TYPE OF PROGRAMS AND THEN ALSO WITH THE MONIES ARE COMING INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM WORKING. OVERTIME WILL CONTINUE WORKING OVERTIME FRIDAY TO GET MONEY INTO THE L. IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM- IS FAR IT AND THEN IT ALSO SEND SET STANDARDS OF HOW. HE HOW THAT'S YOU KNOW WORKS YOU HEARD SOME CRITICISMS OF THIS BILL BY THE HOUSE SOME OF THOSE AGENCIES. HI YELLOW COMMITTEE WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM LIKE I DID IN THE LAST BILL DID IT IN MAYBE YOU MIGHT EVEN BE TALKING. MORE ABOUT SB TWO TO THREE THAN TWO TWO TWO BUT. HE TO TWO DOZEN. TWO EIGHTY IS LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS BILL NOR TWO TO THREE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER DOES ANYTHING TO CHANGE THAT WHATSOEVER. EFFECTED TOTALLY RECOGNIZES THAT THAT IS VERBOTEN TO USE RATEPAYERS MONEY- OTHER PEOPLE'S RATEPAYERS MONEY TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE- YELLED WITH WITH WITH THE RATE. BUT WITH THE RATE LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. DID I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WELL I THINK IT'S A SORT OF YES IT I MEAN I KNOW. THE PROBLEM THAT I THINK THERE'S NOBODY THROUGH THE DESERT IN THE PROBLEM. IT'S ON HOW YOU FIX THE PROBLEM IS I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL KIND OF SCRATCH YOUR HEADS WITH. AND SO I MEAN WE WE'VE USED GRANTS THROUGH WATER BONDS AND WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE EXHAUSTED THOSE FOR MOST AS COMMITTEES IF THEY HAVE. THE STAFF TO EVEN BE ABLE TO WRITE THE GREAT. I MEAN IT'S SO MANY. THE AND I'M ASSUMING THIS IS IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL AS IT IS MINE IF YOU HAVE A- YOU KNOW A TREE SITTERS DISTRICT DIRECTOR WHO'S THE GUY THAT FIXES THE LEAKS AS WELL SINCE THE BILL'S OUT. WHOSE WILLIS EXPECTED RIGHT TO GRANT TO TRY TO GET SOME MONEY FROM THE- PROP SIXTY FOUR WHATEVER. THERE WAS. A LITTLE POTS OF MONEY SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I'M- NOT SURE HOW. THIS ACTUALLY. ACHIEVE THAT FOR ALL THOSE. TO ME SERVICE DISTRICTS OUT THERE OR WATER SUPPLIERS. WHAT FIGURE THE CENTER FROM STOCKTON SAID AT ALL THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM. FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS YEAR NOW. WITH OVER A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH THE WATER DEBT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM. THE WORST LOOK AT I'M NOT LOOKING TOWARDS THE WORST THING THAT EVER HAPPENS. BUT IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OPPOSITION THIS BILL. THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENS WE DON'T GET THE MONEY. WE SET AN ACCOUNT UP TO THE STATE. TREASURY DEPARTMENT- WITH SOME STANDARDS AND THAT WOULD REALLY BE A SHAME. IF NOTHING HAPPENED THERE BUT THAT'S- THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THIS BILL. THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THIS BILL. IS WE GET FEDERAL MONEY THERE. WE GET NONPROFIT MONEY. THERE WE REALLY PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTHS ARE- IN THE LEGISLATURE TO GET BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS. TO MAKE IT A REAL PROGRAM. TO HELP REAL PEOPLE. IT ALSO. REAL HARD WORKING WATER UTILITIES. THAT BECAUSE OF THESE PEOPLE NOT. ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THE WATER UTILITIES THEMSELVES ARE IN TROUBLE. SO EVERY PERSON WHO GETS HELPED. WILL IN THE ED. HELPFUL. WATER UTILITY BY PAYING THEIR BILL. THEY YOU. OKAY WHO ELSE TO HAVE ON THE QUEUE AND OF COURSE WERE ASKING FOR A MOTION ON S. B. TO PASS AS AMENDED REFERS TO MEN AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON TAT. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SIR BRADFORD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SURCHARGE ONE MAKE SOME CLOSING STATEMENTS. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THAT'S PERFECT BECAUSE- THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB TWO TWO TWO BY SENATOR DODD. TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WESSEL HI WESEL EINE DOLLY NO THE ONLY KNOWN BAKER HI. BAKER HI FORGES. BRADFORD HI BRADFORD AYE DODD. HI DODD HI EGGMAN HI EGGMAN I GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ ALL RIGHT. GROW. HERTZBERG I. GOT ME THANK YOU AYE HERTZBERG AYE. MCGUIRE. MAN HI MAN I RUBIO. STERN. AS AND WANNA. THANK YOU HOLD THE ROLE OF PREFER ABSENT MEMBERS WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM SIX S. B. TWO TO THREE BY SENATOR DODD RELATED TO DISCONTINUATION OF RESIDENTIAL WATER SERVICE CENTER DODD WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SB TWO TO THREE STRENGTHENS AND EXTENDS EXISTING STATUTORILY REQUIRED PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES TO PROTECT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE FACING WATER SERVICE DISCONNECTIONS DUE TO THE WATER CUSTOMERS INABILITY TO PAY THEIR BILL. ONCE AGAIN I'M ACCEPTING ALL THE SUGGESTIONS ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS AS OFFERS AMENDMENTS I WON'T REPEAT THE SOBERING FINDINGS OF THE WATER BOARD SURVEY ON WATER DEBT I HIGHLIGHTED FROM SB TWO TWO TWO LET'S JUST SAY HOSE FINDINGS ILLUMINATED A PROBLEM WHICH HAS BEEN GETTING WAY WORSE FOR YEARS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I AUTHORED SB NINE NINE EIGHT WHICH ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF WATER SHUT OFFS. SOME CRITICS OF SB TWO TO THREE ARE ASKING WHY WE NEED THIS BILL IN LIGHT OF NINE NINE EIGHT THE ANSWER IS TWO FOLD FIRST IS WATER THAT HAS DEEPENED THE PROBLEM PEOPLE LOSING ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER IT'S REACHED CRISIS PROPORTIONS. SECOND THE FINAL VERSION OF NINE NINE EIGHT REFLECTED MANY COMPROMISES I MADE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPONENTS. SB TWO TO THREE IS INTENDED TO FILLSOME GAPS LEFT BY THE FINAL VERSION OF S. B. NINE NINE EIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE. CURRENT SHUTTLE PROJECT PROTECTION. IS LIMITED TO WATER SYSTEMS WITH TWO HUNDRED OR MORE CONNECTIONS. SB TWO TO THREE PROPOSES TO INCLUDE SMALLER SYSTEMS IN PROTECTION PROTOCOLS. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR WATER AGENCIES TO SHUT TE WATEROFF WHEN THE RATE PAYERS DELINQUENT FOR SIXTY DAYS. THAT'S A TIGHT TIMELINE FOR LOW INCOME WATER LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD TRYING TO FIND ONE THOUSAND EVEN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO CATCH UP ON THEIR CURRENT BILL. LET ME JUST TELL YOU AS A FORMER- ENTREPRENEUR IN THE WATER BUSINESS I HAD LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS THE IDEA OF SHUTTING SOMEBODY DOWN IT'S SIXTY DAYS. FRANKLY TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN BUSINESS WHAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE SB TWO TO THREE AS AMENDED GIVES THE RATEPAYER NINETY DAYS OR WHEN THE REPAIRS ACCUMULATED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN DEBT. BEFORE SHUT OFFS CAN COMMENCE. SB TWO TO THREE WAVES RECONNECTION FEES FOR RATE PAYERS WHO CERTIFIES LOW INCOME OR HAVE VULNERABLE PER ADMIRABLE NORMAL PERSON IN THE HOUSEHOLD WE'RE TRYING TO DIG OUT FIVE HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND DOLLARS WATER DEBT. RECONNECTION FEES DON'T HELP YOUR PROBLEM. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CURRENT LAW MADE BY S. B. TWO TWO THREE BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS WHAT I MIGHT BE. WHAT MIGHT BE THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PROVISION AND THAT'S DEBT FORGIVENESS. THE INTRODUCED VERSION OF THE BILL REQUIRED WATER SYSTEMS TO OFFER INDEBTED LOW INCOME RATEPAYER IN A RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PLAN. SB TWO TO THREE AS AMENDED REQUIRES A WATER SYSTEMS TO MAKE FINDINGS ON THE RECORD THAT THEY HAVE NO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO FORGIVE DEBT. WHERE NON REPAIR FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN ARREARS PLANTS A RESEARCH PLAN WOULD BE OFFERED. ARREARS PLANS ARE INTENDED TO HELP THE REPAIR CRAWL OUT OF INDEBTEDNESS AS LONG AS THEY STAY CURRENT ON NEW WATER BILLS LET ME REPEAT THAT. AS LONG AS THEY STAY CURRENT ON NEW WATER BILLS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SHUT OFF BUT IF THEY ARE NOT CURRENT THEN THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY ONE FINAL POINT SP TWO TWO THREE NOT ONLY PROTECTS STRUGGLING RATEPAYERS. BUT WHEN COMBINED WITH WATER LIRA ALSO PROTECTS SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN A PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL CONDITION BY PRESERVING REVENUE FLOW. AS WITH TO THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON TWO TO THREE AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING SO WE'RE LISTENING TO THE STAKEHOLDERS. IN IMPROVING THE BILL WITH EVERY WORKING SESSION. I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BILL. ON THE PHONE ARE MIKEY WITNESSES MICHAEL CLAIBORNE AND MORE FEINSTEIN. IN ADDITION THE LARA FEINSTEIN WE HAVE- SPEAKER THE LEAD OPPOSITION TO THE BILL CHRIS CENTERS AND WILL GET THE TO THAT PERSON WHEN. WE COME TO OPPOSITION WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN FIRST WITH MICHAEL CLAIBORNE FOLLOWED BY LARA FEINSTEIN. IF THEY'RE ON THE LINE. GOOD EVENING TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL CLAIBORNE A DIRECTING ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT WORKING ALONGSIDE IN REPRESENTING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THE SAN JOAQUIN EIGHT TELL ABOUT IT. I'M ALSO ADDING SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CLEAN WATER ACTION MANY WATER CENTER AND WATER FOUNDATION. THE REALITY IS THAT ACCESS TO TAP WATER IS NOT UNIVERSAL IN THE STATE AND AT THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING FOR MANY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST ACCESS TO WATER AND MODE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN GET SHOT. THIS IS A STATEWIDE PROBLEM THAT'S THOUGH SOME AREAS ARE HIT HARDER THAN OTHERS HI GREAT THE SHOPS WERE IN LOS ANGELES. AND SANTA MARIA RANCHO CORDOVA HOLDEN BELL GARDENS. NORWALK AND FACTORS- KIDDING HIRED HI IT'S GREAT TO WATER GET. SOME WATER SHUT UP WHY CURRICULA AS FIFTY DOLLARS AT THE TWO TO THREE AS WHETHER WE MEANT WHAT WE SAID IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB SIXTY TO EIGHTY FIVE. WHICH DECLARED ACCESS TO AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER HUMAN RIGHTS AFFORDED TO EVERY HUMAN BEING IN THE STATE. SO THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH IT'S BEEN ON BOOKS FOR NAY A DAY. LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS LOSE ACCESS TO WATER IN THEIR HOMES WHEN THEY FALL BACK BEHIND ON THEIR WATER BILL. AS SHUT OFF AT THE FAMILY FALL SO FAR BEHIND THEY CANNOT CATCH UP. IT IS AN ACT INEQUITABLE SYSTEM PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE HIT HARDEST WITH BLACK FAMILIES TWICE. AS LIKELY AS WHITE TO EXPERIENCE WATERSHED OUT. SB THREE TWO THREE WOULD HELP BY EXTENDING AND STRENGTHENING WATER SHUT OFF PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT SHOPS ARE USED ONLY AS A LAST RESORT. ESPECIALLY WHEN APPLIED LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS. WE HAVE PUT IN CENTRAL TIME AND EFFORT WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THAT EFFORT. WE ASK THE COMMITTEE ENSURE THAT STATE IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN DO NOT GROW UP IN HOMES. I HAVE NO OR ONLY SPORADIC ACT THAT THE TAP WATER. AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES CRITICAL TO HELP SANITATION AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS LAURA FEINSTEIN ON THE PHONE. YES I'M HERE YES PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON TO THE CHAIR COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LAURA FEINSTEIN AND THE pPOLICY DIRECTOR AT HER PUBLIC POLICY ORGANIZATION IN THE BAY AREA. AND YOU KNOW SAFE DRINKING WATER IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH AND AS YOU HEARD FROM SENATOR DODD ONE POINT SIX MILLION HOUSEHOLDS HAVE FALLEN BEHIND ON THEIR WATER BILLS DURING THE PANDEMIC. UNDER CURRENT POLICY MANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS WILL LOSE ACCESS TO WATER THE SHOCK MORATORIUM IS LIFTED WE NEED TO ACT NOW TO AVERT AN EPIDEMIC OF WATER SHUT OFF AMONG LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. A RARE IS MANAGED PLAN HAVE BEEN USED WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY UTILITIES AND OTHER STATE THEY OFFER A BALANCED APPROACH TO HANDLING CUSTOMER UTILITY THAT. INTERMARRIAGE MANAGEMENT PLAN DOES NOT FORGET THAT UNCONDITIONLLY RATHER FOR QUALIFIED LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS IT FORGIVE A PORTION OF THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR ON TIME IN FULL BILL PAYMENT. MANAGEMENT PLANS WHEN TARGETED TO CUSTOMERS DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REPAY THEIR DEBTS ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOUSEHOLD IN THE UTILITY. THE CUSTOMER VOICE TO SHUT OFF AND THE UTILITY RETAIN A PAYING CUSTOMER. PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES MUST MEET MANY FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THE BLL THEIR MISSION OF DELIVERING SAFE WATER BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT MISSION PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIANS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THEIR WATER BILL THAT UTILITIES CANNOT PAY FOR OUT OF THE RACE CARE REVENUE. THIS BILL ASK AGENCIES TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS OF PRIORITIZING USING THEIR NON RATE PAIR REVENUE FOR URGENT. HELPING THEIR CUSTOMERS IN A TIME OF CRISIS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO MOVE NOT A SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF S. B.

IN BEGAN- ALL PARTIES ENGAGED IN THAT THEY'LL WANT TO FIND WAYS TO HELP THOSE IN NEED BY. SPT TWO THREE IS NOT THE ANSWER THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY REASONS FOR OUR POSITION TODAY. THE BILL WOULD PUT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE MIDDLE OF LOCAL WATER MANAGEMENT FUNDING DECISIONS BUT REQUIRING PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES TO PRIORITIZE. NON RATE REVENUE FOR FORGIVENESS OF CUSTOMER THAT. WATER AGENCIES UTILIZE NINE RATE REVENUE FOR VARIETY OF PURPOSES INCLUDING SAFE DRINKING WATER PROJECTS REPAIRS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND MORE- WATER AGENCIES HAVE BEEN RELIED ON THESE FUNDS TO ADDRESS REVENUE LOST DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO JUDGE HOW THEIR DOLLARS ARE SPENT. YEAH SB TWO TO THREE WHICH STRIPPED THIS RESPONSIBILITY FROM LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND FORCE AGENCIES TO SPEND CERTAIN PLANS IN ONE WAY REGARDLESS OF THE NEED FOR THE WATER AGENCY. WHICH WOULD MEAN UNDERFUNDING OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS AND POTENTIALLY LEAD TO HIGHER WATER. RATES TO MAKE UP FOR THIS LOSS REVENUE. SB TWO TO THREE WAY ALL HAS REWRITE THE STATE'S NEW RESIDENTIAL WATER SERVICE SHUT OFF LAW WORK IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT LAW HAS EVEN OCCURRED WATER AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING. SB NINE NINE EIGHT IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY BUT WITH THE PANDEMIC IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER PLACING A MORATORIUM ON SHUT OFF. SB NINE NINE EIGHT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

AFTER PUTTING THIS BILL I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY- AND THE APPROACHES OUTLINED AS FAR AS EMPHASIZING ARREARS MANAGEMENT SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME I'M I DON'T PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA AND I DO DEFERRED TO THE EXPERTISE. OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM NAPA IN WATER DELIVERY SINCE HE'S ACTUALLY DONE IT- BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS HI JUST OVER A YEAR AGO OF COURSE SENATE. GOVERNOR KNEW SOME- SIGNED HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING A MORATORIUM ON WATER SHUTOFFS AND- I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS WE HAD AN ECHO OF IN. WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND WE NEED TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO THAT. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS WHETHER WE'RE ADEQUATELY CONSIDERING THE SOLVENCY FISCAL HEALTH OF OUR WATER DISTRICTS- AS WE HEAD INTO THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES- I MET WITH A NUMBER OF- CONSTITUENTS- RELATED THE WATER INDUSTRY WATER DELIVERY EARLIER THIS WEEK IN. ODD EARLIER DAY MET WITH MY LOCAL WATER DISTRICT- THERE CARRYING A BAD DEBT RIGHT NOW ABOUT THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. DURING NORMAL TIMES THAT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THIS IS AN INCREASE OF. ABOUT ALMOST 2000% OVER THEIR NORMAL BAD DEBT LOAD AND I ASSUME THIS IS A MICROCOSM. OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE. THIS IS AN ON. TIME FOR WATER THIS BE. THE MORE- PROP. TO EIGHTEEN AND US CENTER DOGS RECENT BILL- AND SO I THINK WHAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DO SEEM REASONABLE ON THEIR FACE- I DO HAVE CONCERNS IT'S ABOUT. ADDING ON TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE ALREADY FACING SO. I AM GOING TO VOTE TO MOVE THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE. TODAY BUT I DO. WANT TO STATE THAT THAT'S BASED ON. MINE THAT IT DOT IS WHO IS COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THE UPPER. TO HELP CONTINUE TO TAKE THOSE. IN ACCOUNT. BOB I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS THESE FOR THE RECORD THANK YOU MR JEFF.

AND WITH THAT. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO. ACCELERATE AND IMPROVE THE THINKING AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION S THEY APPROACH SB ONE HUNDRED SO THAT THEY- THEY LOOK AT THE OUTAGES WE'VE HAD IN HE PAST FEW YEARS- AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF REACHING OUR SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS- LOOKING AT THE NEED TO HAVE. THE ABILITY TO GET THE GREED THROUGH A SEVENTY TWO HOUR PERIOD OF TIME. LOOKING AT ZERO CARBON RESOURCES FOR BASELOAD LIKE- EMERGING EFFORTS IN GEOTHERMAL OFFICER WE WIN GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE MULTI DAY ENERGY STORAGE AND OTHER RESOURCES IDENTIFIED IN A RECENT SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT. WE BELIEVE THAT QUICKLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY DEPLOYING THESE ANOTHER FIRM BASELOAD RESOURCES WILL IMPROVE RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY AND THAT WE WILL REBUILD OUR GREED DIFFERENTLY AND HOW TEXAS'S INSISTED ON BUILDING THEY'RE GREAT I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY AND IT'S THE CALIFORNIA WAY- THIS BILL HOPEFULLY BRIDGES A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE RECENT SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT THE SCOPING PLAN IN THE- INTEGRATED ENERGY POLICY REPORT AS WELL AS THE- I. R. P. PROCESS IT P. YOU SEE. HEALTH WE GET ALL THESE AGENCIES ON THE ONE THE SAME PAGE- AND PUSHING FOR A TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TIME FRAME FOR.

PROMOTE THE IDEA OF A BALANCED PORTFOLIO WITH THE GEOTHERMAL PROPOSAL SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHICH WE REALLY WISH HAD PASSED BECAUSE COULD USE THOSE RESOURCES LAST SUMMER- WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IS AN OPENING UP OF THE STATE ENERGY AGENCIES PLANNING PROCESSES TO. IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE ODD NEW RESOURCES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN CONSIDERED IN RECENT MODELING BY THE PCS CLOTHING OFFSHORE WIND GEOTHERMAL. LONG DURATION STORAGE- AND GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN- WITH THAT- DIRECTING AGENCIES TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO LOWER REPAIR COSTS YOUR EXISTING AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES.

A SECTION OF THE BILL- REMAINING UPPER FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS SECTION FOR THE BILL AND- THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS PROPOSES. THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO ALLOW THE CDC TO MAKE PROCUREMENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO PETE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES REGARDING GROWING RENEWABLE AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCES. WHILE THIS APPROACH IS CERTAINLY FAR PREFERABLE THAN ALLOWING EASY TO MAKE PROCUREMENT DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PIER USE. WE STILL DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE CVC APPEAR USE THROUGH THE LOCAL PROCUREMENT DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO PRODUCE WELL BALANCED AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIOS OF GROWING RENEWABLE. AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCES ALL THE WHILE KEEPING RATES AFFORDABLE FOR THE REPAIRS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. ELECTIVELY THE PO USE THAT THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS THE PLAN PROCUREMENT FOR A DIVERSE ARRAY OF RESOURCES THAT MEET SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG TERM RELIABILITY NEEDS. OVER THE LONG TERM AND INDEED. THESE INCLUDE SOME OF THE VERY RESOURCES SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. FIFTY THREE ON THE OTHER HAND IS NOT IS NOT IN THE PROCUREMENT BUSINESS. AT THE STATE AND ENTITY WE DO NOT BELIEVE. THAT THEY ARE WELL POSITIONED TO RECOMMEND WHAT PROCUREMENT DECISIONS MAKE THE MOST SENSE WITHIN THE JURISDICTIONS OF THE FORTY PLUS PO USED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE PROCUREMENT NEEDS APPEAR USE DIFFER DEPENDING ON THAT SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES RESOURCE NEEDS AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. WHICH IS WHY THE PO USED THROUGH THE OVERSIGHT OF THEIR LOCAL GOVERNING BODIES THAT THAT DECISION TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.
