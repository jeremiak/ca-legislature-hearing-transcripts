00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:04.267
COUNTED AND THE VOTE WAS ONE

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:04.868
THOUSAND NINETY EIGHT FOR THE

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:07.237
ELIMINATION OF THE OF THE-

00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:09.906

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:13.576
TO KEEP IT AND I CAN TELL YOU

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:14.744
THAT THE SIX YEARS THAT THESE

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:16.446
FARM WORKERS WERE IT WAITED FOR

00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:19.849
JUSTICE WAS JUST HORRENDOUS ON

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.785
THEM AND THEIR PERSONAL LIVES I

00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:23.520
AM GETTING A CROSS PICKET LINES

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:24.921
EVERY SINGLE DAY FROM FARM

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.289
WORKERS THAT WERE- PEOPLE THAT

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:27.557

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.961
PAID ON THE SIDELINES. IT'S

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:33.229
JUST HORRENDOUS AND I THINK

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.130
THAT PUTTING OUR FARM WORKERS

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:36.132
IN JEOPARDY IS JUST ONE REASON

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:38.401
THIS BIT THIS BILL SHOULD NOT

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:40.203
PASS AGAIN OUR FARM WORKERS ARE

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.305
AN INTEGRAL COG IN THE WHEEL

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:43.540
FOR OUR FOOD SECURITY AND

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:45.308
DEVELOPMENT OF FOOD PRODUCTS

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:46.209
AND TO PUT THEM UNDER THIS TYPE

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:47.744
OF PRESSURE. COUNTLESS FARM

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:49.079
WORKERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

THAT'S BEFORE YOU NOW. IT'S

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:13.970
EASY TO- CHARACTERIZE THE

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:16.573
DEBATE TODAY AS PRO UNION OR

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:18.675
ANTI UNION AND I DON'T THINK

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:20.710
IT'S ANYTHING OF THE KIND. IF

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.312
THE BILL BEFORE US WAS ABOUT

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.747
HOW WE CAN PROTECT THE RIGHT OF

THAT WE PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS.

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:37.827

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:40.196
THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY AND I

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:42.265

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:48.872
RIGHTS IN THAT BILL TO THE

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:52.208
EMPLOYER THAT THEY COULD

00:56:58.214 --> 00:57:00.049
THIS FORMAT THAT'S PROVIDED FOR

THIS BILL TO DECERTIFY A UNION

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:05.622

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:25.675
ABOUT ALLOWING FOR THE

AND CERTAINLY THIS YEAR YOU'LL

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:44.494
SEE AND HEAR AND PASS MANY

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:47.664
BILLS PROTECTING THE RIGHT OF

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.032

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.045
YOU THAT THE BILL BEFORE YOU

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:05.114

ABLE TO VOTE IN THE ELECTION

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:19.462

AND WHETHER IT'S DONE BY A

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.205
UNION OR THE EMPLOYER I THINK

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:29.806
WE SHOULD HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:34.510

APPROPRIATE NEUTRAL PARTY TO

HANDLE THIS RESPONSIBILITY NOT

00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:09.078
PRIVATE PARTIES SINCE. WE HAVE

00:59:09.145 --> 00:59:10.480
A PROCESS TO ENSURE FAIR

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:12.515
ELECTIONS IN OUR FIELDS. WE

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.450

THE FIELDS BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:22.759
THE RIGHT WAY. I THINK THAT THE

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:24.093
BILL BEFORE US AS THE BEST OF

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.030
INTENTIONS BUT IT DOES IT IN A

00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:28.998
WAY THAT UNDERCUTS OUR

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:33.303
DEMOCRATIC VALUES OF FEDERAL

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:35.271
ACTIONS FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:38.775
THE SELECTED FEW AND MEMBERS

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.076
WANT TO GET THIS BILL WAS

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:41.411
BEFORE YOU GIVEN THE SAME

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:42.578
RIGHTS TO THE EMPLOYER TO

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:44.714
DECERTIFY I THINK WE WOULD ALL

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.316
HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT OF

00:59:46.382 --> 00:59:48.051
EXPRESSING HERE TODAY

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:49.719
ACCORDINGLY I WOULD RECOMMEND A

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:52.221
NO VOTE ON A. B. SIX SIXTEEN.

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:56.225
SENATOR BURGESS. MADAM

00:59:56.292 --> 01:00:00.396
PRESIDENT I THINK MY COLLEAGUES

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.831
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP SOME VERY

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:03.266
IMPORTANT POINTS SO I WON'T.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:08.905
RECITE. THEM IN TOO MUCH DETAIL

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:11.607
THIS IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE ISSUE

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:12.542
FOR MANY YEARS WE'VE BEEN

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:15.244
TALKING ABOUT- VOTER PROTECTION

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:17.680
IN FRANCHISE MEANT WHAT IT

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:20.917
MEANS FOR OUR TO OUR TO OUR

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:23.186
AMERICAN SYSTEM OR OR FORM OF

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:25.588
REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IF

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:27.824
YOU BELIEVE IN VOTER PROTECTION

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.326
IN THE SANCTITY OF THE VOTE

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:32.662
DISCLOSING AND CREATING

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:34.230
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.999
TO BE INFLUENCE INTIMIDATED

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:39.402
THREATENED THAT'S ANATHEMA TO

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.171
WHAT WE STAND FOR. SO

01:00:42.238 --> 01:00:43.639
COLLEAGUES- I'D HAVE TO AGREE

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:46.876
WITH THE FORMER PRESENTER THIS

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:50.713
IS NOT A FULLY BAKED IDEA IT

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.682
DESERVES A LOT MORE REVIEW A

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:54.283
LOT MORE EXAMINATION BECAUSE I

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.252
THINK THERE COULD BE SOME PASS

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.587
FORWARD BUT UNDER ITS CURRENT

01:00:57.653 --> 01:01:00.857
FORM THIS IS AN ON DEMOCRATIC

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.925
PIECE OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.861
AND I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:08.297
A NO VOTE. AND ASK THE AUTHOR

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:09.899
TO REVISIT THIS WITH MORE

01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:12.335
INDIVIDUALS- AT THE TABLE MORE

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:15.304
STAKEHOLDERS- TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:16.639
TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:23.012
TO VOTE AND TO VOTE SAFELY.

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:26.449
SENATOR NIELSEN OKAY MADAM

SENATE HIRED YOUR NO VOTE AND

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:31.821

FOR MYSTICALLY NOT CALL A CARD

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.735
CHECK THAT'S OKAY BUT IT IS NOT

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:48.838
DEMOCRATIC IT ALLOWS AN

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.574
INTERMEDIATE PARTY A PARTISAN

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:52.642
PARTY TO INTERFERE IN THE

OVER THE YEARS UPFRONT AND

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:17.900

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:00.536
YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IN THE

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.572
BILL ANALYSIS REQUIRES THESE

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.106
BALLOTS THAT WERE REFERRED TO

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.742
BE SEALED IN ENVELOPES. AND

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:09.145
SIGNED UP BY THE ACTUAL

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:11.581

DELIVERED BY SOMEONE ELSE- NOT.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.852
UNLIKE WHAT VOTERS WILL BE

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:18.487
DOING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:19.789
IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION AND

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:22.358
MOST UPCOMING ELECTIONS- NOT

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.793
UNLIKELY TO SOLUTION THAT WE'VE

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:25.161
ADOPTED HERE. IN THE

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.230
LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW RANK AND

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:29.765
FILE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA- TO

DESTROYED BEFORE COUNTING OR

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:40.943
SET ASIDE. SO THAT THE BALLOT

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:43.813
ITSELF REMAINS SECRET- THINK

01:04:43.879 --> 01:04:45.114

THINK THE BILL IS SOLID. I'M A

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:54.523
LITTLE SURPRISED TO SOME DEGREE

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:57.493
OTHER THAN- THE OBVIOUS

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.928
CONCERNS THAT THE FOLKS WOULD

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:01.063
HAVE WHO ARE AGAINST ORGANIZED

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.666
IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHY

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.002
AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS YOU KNOW

SPENT SOME TIME IN THAT SPACE-

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:11.674
WOULD WANT THE DISRUPTION. OF

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.809
THESE ELECTIONS GOING ON ON

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:16.445
SITE- WITHOUT THE ABILITY OF

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:18.281
PUTTING BALLOTS AND ENVELOPES

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:20.349
IN GATHERING THEM REMOTELY AND

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:22.618
GETTING THEM DELIVERED- IN IN

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.920
AN EFFICIENT. MANNER AND IN A

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.055
MANNER THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.257
THE SAME EFFICACY THAT WE HAVE

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:29.992
IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS IN THE

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.761
SAME LACK OF CONSTRAINTS THAT

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:33.629
WE HAVE. IN THE UNITED STATES

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:34.463
OF AMERICA IN THE STATE OF

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.165
CALIFORNIA WITH OUR OWN.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:37.867
ELECTIONS COLLECTION PROCESSES

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:42.405
SO I STRONGLY. URGE AND I VOTE

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:43.973
ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SENATOR

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.676
TIGHTER THANK YOU MADAM

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:49.378
PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES MANY OF

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:52.648
YOU KNOW THAT. MY PARENTS WERE

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:55.584
FORMER OCCURS AND I USED TO BE

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:58.521
A LABOR ORGANIZER FOR SEVERAL

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:01.991
YEARS- AND ONE OF THE THINGS

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:06.162
THAT I NOTICED AS AN ORGANIZER-

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:08.898
TRYING TO RECRUIT MEMBERSHIP

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:12.168
INTO A UNION IS THAT-

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.937
INDIVIDUALS HAD TO UNDERSTAND

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.772
THE VALUE OF HAVING A UNION.

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:19.141
TELLING THEM OR EVEN SENDING A

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:22.378
BALLOT DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE THE

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:25.147
VALUE OF THE UNION NOT TO SAY

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:26.982
THAT THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.617
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF VALUE

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:29.518
IN HAVING MILLIONS IN THE

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:32.455
WORKPLACES- I'LL TELL YOU THAT

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:33.956
I'VE ALSO MET THIS WEEKEND WITH

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:36.625
FARMERS. AND I WILL TELL YOU

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:39.161
THAT THE LAST THING ON THEIR

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:41.130
MIND IS WHETHER OR NOT TO JOIN

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:44.100
THE UNION RIGHT NOW THE ONE

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:46.869
MAIN CONCERN ON THEIR MIND IS

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:49.105
WATER BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:51.340
HAVE ANY WATER THEY DON'T HAVE

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:55.311
A JOB AND THIS BILL CAN MAKE

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.279
ITS WAY THROUGH AND IT IT IT

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.881
I'M SURE THE DEAN THE

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:02.051
INTENTIONS OF THE BILL. I SEEK

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.853
TO DO GOOD FOR FARM WORKERS

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:04.687
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:08.224
