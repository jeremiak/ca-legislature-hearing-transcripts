COMMITTEE -- WE NEED -- MISS SKINNER. OS TWO BILLS [inaudible] ANDMISTER WEINER IF HE WANTS TO FINISH OUT THE DAY WE HAVE ONE OF HIS BILLS LEFT [inaudible] BUG [inaudible] MR PORTANTINO. POSTPONED HIS LAST BILL UNTIL JULY NINTH SERGEANT COULD YOU CALL MISS SKINNER'S OFFICE -- PLACES ARE RESEARCHERS [inaudible] YES. WHICH IS A WE HAVE THE PLEASURE. OF THE CHAIR OF SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY. GRAY SEEN OUR IS STEAM CHAMBERS YEAH. TWO ITEMS SB FORTY TWO SB THREE NINE FOUR ITEMS NUMBER THREE AND NUMBER [inaudible] NINETEEN OKAY [inaudible] SHE'S. THANK YOU CHAIR WON'T SKINNER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED YES THANK YOU -- WE'RE PRESENTING SB -- FORTY TWO THE GETTING HOME SAFE ACT. AND THIS BILL. IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENED BUT IT WAS INSPIRED AND NOW I DON'T I DON'T SEE INSPIRED THAT'S NOT EVEN IF THE APPROPRIATE THING TO SAY I SHOULD REALLY SAY IS THAT THERE WAS A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY. IN MY AREA. WHERE -- JESSICA ST LOUIS A WOMAN WHO WOULD IT WAS ONLY IN -- JAIL FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WAS RELEASED FROM JAIL AT ONE IN THE MORNING WITH A BART TICKET YOU KNOW THE BAY AREA BARGES ARE TRANSIT SYSTEM HE DOESN'T RUN. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IT DOESN'T START AGAIN UNTIL MORNING FIVE AM OR SO. SO SHE'S GIVEN OF OUR TICKET SHE HAS NOTHING ELSE. AND D.. BART IS RELATIVELY CLOSE TO ALAMEDA COUNTY JAIL TO SANTA RITA IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF A MILE. BUT IT'S VERY DESOLATE BETWEEN WHERE THE BARGES IN THE JAIL. BECAUSE A LUIS WAS FOUND DEAD. BEFORE PART EVEN OPENED. AND HEY TO TO HAVE THIS WAS AN AVOIDABLE TRAGEDY THIS WAS A DEATH SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. AND TO RELEASE PEOPLE WHEN WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO CALL SOMEONE TO GET A RIDE WERE NOT MAKING YOU KNOW IF THEY DON'T HAVE A WORKING CELL PHONE ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. JUST RELEASING THEM DURING NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS ALL OF THOSE THINGS WOULD HELP AVOID SUCH DEATHS JUST BECAUSE ST LOUIS IS NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS DIED WITHIN A SHORT TIME OF BEING RELEASED. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT -- SO THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES AND I CAN GO THROUGH ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS BATES IN YOUR ANALYSIS AND NOW I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND I HAVE SUSAN BURTON NEW WAY OF LIFE.

LIKE ROCKET SCIENCE [inaudible] DAD -- PEOPLE. I SHARES COULD SEE THE VULNERABILITY OF WOMEN AND ALSO [inaudible] THEIR HUMANITY. TO RECEIVE SUPPORTS IN RELEASES THAT HOURS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS SERVICES. AND ACCESS SUPPORTED NOT BE LET OUT IN THE DARK OF THE NIGHT. I'M IN TOTAL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- DAD WE WOULD INSURE PEOPLE WOMEN [inaudible] GET RELEASED. AT A TIME THAT THEY CAN ASK SEX ACCESS SERVICES. AND NOT BE VULNERABLE -- SO THAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO SAY AND I'M THANKFUL THAT THIS BILL IS CAME ABOUT -- IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO THINK THAT WE WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW -- SORT OF LIKE DOCUMENTS COMMONSENSE AROUND WHAT WE SHOULD DO BASS. FOR LIMÃ³N -- FOR PEOPLE BUT WE DO NEED A BAIL -- BECAUSE IT'S STILL HAPPENING TODAY THANK YOU Q. [inaudible] YES MA'AM -- HI MY NAME IS CHRISTINE AND OF OUR AS AND I WAS FORMALLY INCARCERATED. I HAVE -- BEEN OUT FOR ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OVER A MONTH. MY INITIAL RELEASE DATE WAS JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH BUT I RECEIVED AN EARLY KICK OUT. WITH NO PRIOR NOTICE THEY KIND OF JUST YOU KNOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I THINK IT WAS THAT AFTER -- EIGHT THEY JUST TOLD ME TO ROLL IT UP THAT I WAS BEING RELEASED -- I REMEMBER JUST BEING NERVOUS BECAUSE I KNEW I DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE IN MY POSITION I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. I DON'T HAVE A RIDE ADDING CONTACTED ANYONE BUT WHILE BEING INCARCERATED I READ MISPRINTS BUCK. AND I WROTE HER AND SHE WROTE ME BACK AND PERSONALLY GAVE ME HER PHONE NUMBER TO CALL HER WHENEVER -- I WAS RELEASED AND THAT SHE WOULD ACCEPT ME INTO THE PROGRAM -- WHILE. WAITING TO BE RELEASED THERE ABOUT FIVE OR SIX OTHER GIRLS ARE BEING RELEASED AROUND THE SAME TIME. NONE OF THEM ARE ANY OF US HAD A PHONE AT THE TIME. OR IN OUR POSSESSION. ONE OF THE GIRLS -- OFFERED US TO GO OVER TO OUR HOUSE WHICH WAS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET -- TO GO USE THE PHONE AT OUR HOUSE. BUT WHEN I HEARD THEM TALKING ABOUT DRUGS AND ALCOHOL I DECIDED TO STAY BACK AND I HAD TO WAIT. UNTIL SOMEBODY WALKED BY TO ALLOW ME TO USE THE PHONE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE FAMILIAR WITH -- THE LIN WOOD AREA BUT LONG BEACH BOULEVARD IS KNOWN FOR SOLICITING AND YOU KNOW JUST ALL THE DANGER AROUND THOSE AREAS SO I DON'T WANT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET -- THANK GOD I WAS ABLE TO FIND A PHONE. AND CALLED IS FOR IN AT AROUND NINE A LITTLE BIT OVER NINE AND SHE ACTUALLY ANSWERED. AND CONNECTED TO SOMEBODY I WAS ABLE TO PICK ME UP -- AND GET ME TO THE PROGRAM SAFE. SO I JUST. I'M THANKFUL THAT SHE WAS THERE YOU KNOW THAT. HELP WAS AVAILABLE BUT I'M LIKE SHE SAID I FEEL LIKE JUST HAVING PHONE CHARGING STATIONS OR THE ABILITY FOR US TO MAKE PHONE CALLS WITHOUT THEM HAVING TO BE COLLIDE.

KELLY LIEU DANS MORE WITH THE TRANS GENDER GENDER VARIANT INTERSEX JUSTICE PROJECT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AS CORSO'S ALONG BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB FORTY TWO WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR -- TAKING AMENDMENTS IN THE FIRST HOUSE -- DEALING WITH THE TRANSPORTATION PROVISIONS OF THE BILL -- WILL SPREE SHOULD THE COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL I EVEN FURTHER HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE OP WILL TELL YOU WE STILL HAVE TO ANYTHING BIG OUTSTANDING CONCERNS. THE FIRST IS THAT EXISTING LAW PROVIDES -- THE AUTHORITY FOR SHERIFF -- RUNNING A JAIL TO ALLOW A PROGRAM WHERE BY SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT WANT TO BE RELEASED A CERTAIN TIME TO STAY AN EXTRA -- SEVERAL HOURS IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THAT -- CHANGE UNTIL YOU GET TO A A MORNING TIME OR SOME OTHER OF POINT WHEN IT'S NOT -- AT NIGHT TIME OR WHEN IT WHEN IT'S NOT COLD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- TO BE RELEASED AND SO THAT'S EXISTING LAW THAT THAT MAY BE OFFERED THIS WOULD MANDATE -- THAT THAT PROGRAM BE OFFERED -- IF A PERSON CHOOSES NOT TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT OPTION THEN THEY'RE REQUIRED TO BE OFFERED A SAFE PLACE TO STAY SO PRESUMABLY A NON CUSTODIAL ENVIRONMENT SO EITHER -- CUSTODIAL OR NON CUSTODIAL WAITING ROOM STILL IN THE JAIL -- ONE OF THOSE OR BOTH OF THOSE OPTIONS HAVE TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THIS BILL -- SO THAT CREATES OBVIOUSLY COST PRESSURES AND MANDATES -- THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT A PERSON WHO'S BEEN IN CUSTODY FOR THIRTY DAYS OR LONGER BE RELEASED WITH AT LEAST THREE DAYS MEDICATION. WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED AND DESIRE FOR PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED WITH MEDICINE IT'S NOT -- IN OPPOSITION TO THAT THERE IS VERY LITTLE LIMITATION EVEN WITH THE BILL'S AMENDMENTS ARE ON WHAT TYPES OF MEDICATIONS WOULD BE RELEASED WITH THE PERSON -- THE COULD BE MEDICINE THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN UNDER SUPERVISION -- IT COULD BE SOMETHING NECESSARY LIKE INSULIN OR IT COULD BE AN OPIATE -- ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS EASILY ABUSED ONE OF THOSE IS NOT -- SO I THINK THIS THERE COULD BE GREATER SPECIFICITY AND CLARITY ABOUT. WHAT TYPES OF MEDICATIONS ARE RELEASED? AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A PURPOSE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY FOR BOTH OF THESE THINGS WE THINK THEY BRING LIABILITY TO COUNTIES. IN AS MUCH AS THEY'D BE MANDATED TO REQUIRE PEOPLE TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY OR TO PROVIDE THEM WITH MEDICATIONS AS THEY DEPART THE FACILITY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YES GOOD AFTERNOON ELIZABETH ESPINOSA ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA ALL ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF A MISTER SELLS A LOT FROM THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. YES MISS WHAT -- FOR SOMEONE IT THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- AND AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY IT'S VERY POWERFUL TO HEAR FROM YOU -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE TRAGEDY OF THE DEATH OF JUST ST LOUIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN THE CATALYST OF THIS -- BUT I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU YOU BROUGHT THIS TO US TODAY I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. YES. YES. A MARKET OF I TO WANT TO THANK SENATOR SCANNER -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND ALSO WOULD -- BE HONORED TO JOIN ON AS A CO AUTHOR -- AS A CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INCARCERATED WOMEN I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE WORTH FURTHER EXPLORATION IN THAT COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT AN UNVEILED. I'M ALL OF THE TRAUMAS I MEAN CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED BY -- IN PARTICULAR WOMEN -- AND GIRLS WHO ARE INCARCERATED -- I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT FOLKS WHO ARE RELEASED WANT TO SPEND ADDITIONAL TIME -- IN JAIL ARE IN PRISON I THINK THEY WANT TO GET OUT AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN -- SPEAKING TO THE OPPOSITION BUT IT'S MAKING SURE THAT -- THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE RELEASED ARE RELEASED IN A WAY THAT IS SAFE -- AND THAT BRINGS WITH THE DIGNITY BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS TO SEE FOLKS GOING IN OR WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE FURTHER ATTACKED OR EVEN KILLED. AND AS IT RELATES TO THE MEDICATION I WAS THINKING SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE TESTIMONY OF OTHER WOMEN WHO SHARED THAT IT WOULD ALSO BE WONDERFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN ARE GIVEN I'M A COUPLE OF DAYS WORTH OF PERSONAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE MEDICATION BUT IT'S SOMETHING ELSE TO KIND OF HAVE SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU NEED AS YOU'RE GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRYING TO GET SETTLED. SO I DON'T HAVE THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO LATE TO PUT IN BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW WE TREAT ALL FOLKS WITH DIGNITY. THANK YOU HER ANY OTHER COMMENT YOU MAY. YOU MAY CLOSE -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I'M HAPPY TO ADD TO REQUESTED CO AUTHORS AND I FORGOT TO OPEN WITH THAT I AM TAKING MIDIS. TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. AND TO THE POINTER ON THE MEDICATIONS THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL DOES SAY ESSENTIAL MEDICATIONS -- SO I A AND IF WE THINK ABOUT IT IF. IF A PERSON FOR EXAMPLE IS DIABETIC AND THEY ARE RELEASED AT A TIME WHERE. WE AND THEY HAVE NO BUT THAT YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE ON THEIR PERSON THEIR PRESCRIPTION OR ANY OF THAT. THEN THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMMEDIATELY GET THAT ESSENTIAL MEDICATION THAT THEY NEED SO I THINK THAT'S VERY -- NECESSARY AND IN TERMS OF THE THAT IT ISN'T STATUTE ALREADY FOR JAILS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER TO A PERSON. THAT YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE RELEASED AT A DIFFERENT TIME -- IF WE TAKE THE OUR TESTIMONY FOR MISS NAVARRO'S SHE WASN'T MAY DATE WASN'T GIVEN THAT OFFER -- AND SO IT'S MAYBE THERE ARE SOME OF OUR COUNTY JAILS THAT ARE AVAILING -- THERE -- FOLKS OF THAT BUT IT'S NOT WELL KNOWN AND IT'S NOT AS FAR AS WE COULD -- GET INFORMATION ON BEING UTILIZED AND THEN THE LAST THING THAT LAST POINT I'D MAKE AND I AM REALLY REALLY AM PROUD OF MISSING OF OURS. FOR HAVING THE GOOD SENSE NUMBER ONE NOT GO WITH THE OTHER WOMEN WHO WERE RELEASED -- TO WHERE SHE MIGHT BE. EXPOSED TO DRUGS AND WHETHER SHE USE THEM HERSELF FOR NOT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN AND SUBJECT TO ARREST AGAIN. OR IT -- IT IT IN THE CASE OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY THEY IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCE AN OVERDOSE BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT HAD. DRUGS IN THE NAY OR IMMEDIATELY -- GIVEN THEM BUT SHE HAD THE GOOD SENSE NOT TO DO THAT AND YET JUST HOW WHAT A KIND OF MIRACLE THAT SHE HAPPENED TO READ MISTER BURTON'S BOOK AND CONTACTED MS BURTON AND HAD SOMEONE THAT WOULD COME AND PICK HER UP. THAT IS A RARE THING TO HAVE HAPPEN AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE OUR JAILS ARE SITUATED BELIEVE ME. ANYONE HANG AROUND OUR JAILS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS NOT HANG AROUND FOR A GOOD PERSON COULD PURPOSE THEY'RE USUALLY PREDATORY INDIVIDUALS WHETHER THEY'RE ENGAGED IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING OR WHETHER THEY'RE ENGAGED IN DRUG DEALING OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT HANG AROUND JAILS SO THE ONE OF THE OWNER OF A PERSON IS RELEASED THAT PERSON IS IMMEDIATELY PUT AT RISK. SO I THINK THIS BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I APPRECIATE -- BEING ABLE TO PRESENT IT TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IN THANK YOU AND I AND I HOPE. THAT -- THE SHERIFF IN THE RURAL COUNTIES WILL WORK WITH. WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND MAYBE NINETY NINE POINT 99% OF THE DETAILS DO. OFFER AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T PUT PEOPLE OUT INCLEMENT WEATHER AND THINGS THAT NATURE BUT IT ONLY TAKES ONE AND HOPEFULLY YOU LOOK AT THIS I KNOW WE USE MAY VERSUS SHALL. AND I THINK. IF YOU'RE DOING IT ALREADY. DAN SHALL IS NOT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. IN PART TWO I AM THE INSULIN I I UNDERSTAND. BUT ALSO THE LOOK I I I SEE A LOT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE. IN LOS ANGELES. MANY OF THEM I BELIEVE DO NEED PSYCHOTROPIC SOME OF THEM DIDN'T GET IT WHEN THEY LEFT PRISON THEY HAD IT WHEN THEY WERE IN PRISON. AND SO I'M NOT. TOO UPSET IF YOU DON'T GIVE THEM MUST ENOUGH SUPPLIES SO THAT THEY CAN DEAL WITH REALITY WHEN THEY GET OUT OTHERWISE HE MAY END UP IN. BEING HOMELESS AND OTHER THINGS AND SO -- OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR OTHER ROLE COUNTIES. URBAN COUNTIES OR ANYTHING. OF THAT NATURE BUT IN SOME CASES SOME PEOPLE MAY NEED. SOME OF THOSE DRUGS JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE DAY WHEN THEY GET OUT -- AND SO -- WITH THAT CHEERS RECOMMEND IN I ON SB FORTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. GEN SIR IRAQI [inaudible] BARRICADE HAND [inaudible] MATHIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK SANTIAGO. WICKS WICKS I IMAGES ON CALL. VOTE. AND WE NEED TO MORE THREE MEMBERS ARE OUT DURING THE AND YOUR NEXT. ONE THANK YOU. SO -- THANK YOU I'M COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND A CHAIR WE WILL -- PERCENT NOW I WILL SB THREE NINETY FOUR WHAT SB THREE NINETY FOR THE PURPOSE OF IT IS REALLY IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP A FAMILY INTACT. THEN I THINK THERE'S SO MANY -- SO MANY -- IT. PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNITY SAFETY WELL BEING PUBLIC HEALTH -- REASONS TO DO OUR BEST TO KEEP FAMILIES INTACT -- AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD OFFER [inaudible] THE IT WOULD CREATE A DIVERSION COURT FOR PRIMARY CARE GIVERS TO PROVIDE OPTION FOR PEOPLE WITH DEPENDENTS NO ONLY SAY PEOPLE DEPENDENCY DOES NOT ONLY HAVE TO BE A PERSON WITH CHILDREN. IT CAN BE A PERSON WHO IS THE PRIMARY CARETAKER SAY OF AN ELDERLY PARENT OR SOMEONE ELSE. AND IF THEY ARE. INSTEAD INCARCERATED THEN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON THEM IN THE CASE OF CHILDREN ARE OFTEN PUT IN OUR FOSTER SYSTEM AND WE KNOW THE OUTCOMES FOR OUR FOSTER CHILDREN IS NOT ARE NOT GREAT -- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT OTHER PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON THAT THEIR CARE GIVER IS REMOVED THERE THAT HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS. FOR THOSE PEOPLE AND THEN ADDITIONALLY. THERE'S ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON EVERY PART OF THE FAMILY -- SO THERE'S MANY THINGS IN THE BILL THAT -- LIMIT WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS THERE'S JUDICIAL DISCRETION BUT WHAT IT DOES IS CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PRE TRIAL DIVERSION FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD QUALIFY. TO BE ABLE TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE MY WITNESSES -- TO TO TESTIFY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF TODAY'S COMMITTEE OUR PARENTS -- I'M SORRY MY NAME IS ASHLEY CARTER I'M FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMAN. I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU ARE PARENTS. AS PARENTS I'M SURE YOU CAN AGREE THAT THERE'S ALMOST NO PAIN GREATER THAN THAT OF SEEING YOUR CHILD SUFFER AND NOT BE ABLE TO HELP. MY LIFE UP UNTIL I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS GOING TO BE A MOTHER WAS CHAOTIC AT BEST. FULL OF POVERTY PAIN ABUSE AND ABANDONMENT. MY DAUGHTER LITERALLY SAVED ME FROM THAT LIFE. FROM THE MOMENT THAT I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT. I COMPLETELY COMMITTED MYSELF TO CREATING THE BEST LIFE POSSIBLE FOR HER. UNFORTUNATELY I FAILED IN DOING SO. THE DECISIONS A MISTAKE THAT I HAD MADEUP UNTIL THAT POINT HAD CAUGHT UP TO ME AND I WAS INDICTED ON DRUG CHARGES WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS JUST EIGHT MONTHS OLD. I SPENT THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS FIGHTING TO PROVE TO THE COURTS MY COMMUNITY AND TO MYSELF. THAT I WAS MORE THAN JUST MY MISTAKES. I WORK TWO JOBS BECAME A CELEBRATED EMPLOYEE AND ROLLED IN SCHOOL ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN GIVING BACK TO MY COMMUNITY TO ORGANIZING DRIVES AND RAISING MONEY FOR LOCAL CAUSES. I ATTENDED THERAPY REGULARLY COMPLIED WITH EVERY SINGLE STIPULATION THAT PROBATION AND PRETRIAL SET FORTH BEFORE MEET WITH NOT ONE SINGLE VIOLATION. THIRTY DRUG TEST OR SO MUCH AS A TRAFFIC TICKET IN THREE YEARS. WHEN I WENT BEFORE THE JUDGE FOR SENTENCING AND ASKED THAT HE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MY EFFORTS AND PROVEN CHANGE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS? I WAS TOLD THAT WHILE ALL THAT WAS GREAT I HAD TO PAY. THE REALITY OF HIS STATEMENT WAS THAT MY DAUGHTER HAD TO PAY. MY MOTHER HAD TO PAY AND I WOULD NEVER BE DONE PAYING. MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER O'MARA WHO WAS JUST SITTING ON MY LAP. IS HERE WITH ME. AND SHE IS EXACTLY HOW OLD MY DAUGHTER ASIA WAS WHEN I KISSED HER GOODBYE AT THE PRISON GATES I WOULDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. THE AFFECTS OF MY INCARCERATION HAVE HAD RIPPLES FAR GREATER THAN WHAT MOST PEOPLE. WHO HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED INCARCERATION CAM REALIZE? AND THE REALITY IS THAT MOST OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF INCARCERATION LAND ON OUR BABIES. THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE SB THREE NINETY FOUR IS THE MECHANISM FOR THAT CHANGE. NOT BY ALLOWING MOTHERS AND FATHERS TO GET OFF SCOT FREE BUT BY AFFORDING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED. IN ORDER TO DO BETTER AND BE BETTER FOR THEMSELVES THEIR CHILDREN IN OUR SOCIETY. SB THREE NINETY FOUR IS NOT A SECOND CHANCE FOR MOST OF US IS THE FIRST THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IN A WAY WHAT REMAINED AS A TIME FOR CHANGE -- I LOST MY KIDS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS AT FIRST INCARCERATED AND DOES THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I WAS INCARCERATED -- IN THOSE FIVE YEARS -- TRYING TO REGAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. AFTER THE FIRST THREE YEARS THAT THEY WERE GONE FOR ME HI -- WHAT WAS IT WAS STRANGE? IT WAS A STRAINED RELATIONSHIP -- TWO YEARS AGO I PHYSICALLY LOST THEM I LOST CUSTODY OF THEM AND THEY WENT INTO THE FOSTER SYSTEM -- SINCE THEN I'VE GOTTEN MY SON BACK AND BUT A YEAR ABOUT SIXTEEN MONTHS AFTER THAT I GOT MY DAUGHTER BACK. AND I'M TRYING TO REGAIN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HER I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW I AM. I'M WITH THE TIME FOR CHANGE FOUNDATION HERE AND WHAT THE TIME FOR CHANGE FOUNDATION PROGRAM DOES IS GIVE ME THE SUPPORT. THE THE GROUPS THE IT GIVES ME THE SUPPORT THAT I NEED IN ORDER TO BE A BETTER BETTER MOTHER FOR MY CHILDREN. SB OF NINE SB NINETY FOUR WERE NOT ONLY HELP ME AND HELP MOTHERS LIKE ME BUT WOULD HELP THE NEXT OF KIN. WITH THINGS THE WITH. THE THINGS THAT I NEEDED HELP WITH I HAD NOBODY TO HELP ME.

I APOLOGIZE TO PROVIDE DANCE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. MR SELF SAITO'S ON HIS WAY ALONG WITH THE DA SO COULD YOU MAKE ROOM. I APOLOGIZE TO YOU GENTLEMAN. THE AFTERNOON I'M MOVING TO FAST. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE REMAIN REGRETTABLY OPPOSED. TO SB THREE NINETY FOUR WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. MOST IMPORTANTLY WALL CASE LAW HAS NOT DRAWN THIS LINE IN THE SAND IS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES WE BELIEVE SB THREE NINETY FOUR IS NOT. CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WITH WHAT MOST OF US UNDERSTAND THIS EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE CREATION OF A NEW PRE TRIAL DIVERSION SCHEME SINGLING OUT ONE CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS. PARENTS OF CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN FOR MORE FAVORABLE TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW. THAN OTHERS CHARGED WITH SIMILAR CRIMES. UNDER SB THREE NINETY FOUR DEFENDANT CHARGED WITH ALMOST ANY MISDEMEANOR INCLUDING MISDEMEANORS SEX OFFENSES OR ANY NON SERIOUS NON VIOLENT FELONY. INCLUDING THEFT FRAUD AND BURGLARY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR A DIVERSION PROGRAM OF UNSPECIFIED LENGTH. IF HERE SHE CAN SHOW THAT HERE SHE IS THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER OF ANY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN INDEED IF A DEFENDANT IS IN A TWO PARENT HOME WHERE ONE PARENT IS A PRIMARY CARE GIVER IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL. AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND THE OTHER PARENT IS THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT IT APPEARS THAT BOTH WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION UNDER THIS BILL. THIS BILL ALSO OFFENDS NOTIONS OF EQUAL PROTECTION BY BENEFITING WEALTHIER DEFENDANTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE COST OF THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS. THE BILL DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY KIND OF FUNDING STREAM TO PAY THE CONSIDERABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DIVERSION PROGRAM. SO THOSE DEFENDANTS WITH THE MEANS TO PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CRIMES ARE RACED. BUT OTHER DEFENDANTS WITHOUT CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN WILL HAVE ON THEIR RECORDS. WELL NOT SPEAKING FOR LA COUNTY IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT IN LA COUNTY ALONE THERE ARE ROUGHLY A QUARTER MILLION MISDEMEANORS FILED EACH YEAR. SB THREE NINETY FOUR WOULD ALLOW MANY OF THESE DEFENDANTS PLUS A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ELEVEN SEVENTY H. FELONS TO MAKE A CASE FOR DIVERSION BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE CHILDREN. LEAVING THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE CHILDREN NO OPPORTUNITY TO BE DIVERTED FOR THE SAME CRIMES. NOT ONLY IS THIS INEQUITABLE IT IS GUARANTEED TO BOG DOWN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. SINCE THIS IS A PRE PLEA PROGRAM THE COURT WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE ALL OF THESE CASES OPEN FOR UP TO TWO YEARS WHILE THE DEFENDANT PARTICIPATES IN THE PROGRAM. SAY HOWEVER THAT THE DEFENDANT FAILS THE PROGRAM AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS PROSECUTORS WOULD THEN BE SCRAMBLING TO PUT TOGETHER A CASE ON THE ORIGINAL CHARGES WERE WITNESSES MAY LOOK NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE OR MEMORIES OF DEM. SB THREE NINETY FOUR ALSO FAILS TO EVEN CONSIDER THE VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES MANY OF WHOM WERE ENTITLED TO RESTITUTION. HOW AND WHEN ILL RESTITUTION BE PAID WHILE THE CASE IS BEING DIVERTED? CONSIDER TOO THAT SINCE A PERSON WHO COMPLETES A PRETRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM WOULD HAVE THE CRIME OR RAISED A FUTURE EMPLOYER WILL NOT BE ALERTED TO THE FACT THAT A NEW EMPLOYEE. AND TRUSTED WITH HANDLING MONEY OR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES MAY HAVE MULTIPLE ARRESTS FOR FORGERY EMBEZZLEMENT OR OTHER FINANCIAL CRIMES. D. A.'S ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE ENTHUSIASTICALLY ESTABLISH MANY DIVERSION PROGRAMS IN THEIR COUNTIES FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH VETERANS AND HOMELESSNESS JUST TO NAME A FEW. HOWEVER THIS BILL IF PASSED INTO LAW WILL LIKELY NOT BE IMPLEMENTED BY MANY D. A.'S A FACT THAT SEEMS CURIOUSLY AT ODDS WITH ITS INTENT. THE BILL PROVIDES THAT THE COURT MAY SET UP THE FORMAL PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM OUTLINED HERE WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE DA AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A DA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CREATION OF SUCH A PROGRAM AND NO SUCH PROGRAM CAN BE CREATED WITH OUT THE PARTICIPATION OF THE DA. AND SINCE THE BILL ALLOWS A JUDGE TO ENROLL A DEFENDANT IN THE PROGRAM OVER THE AND JOB OBJECTIONS OF THE DA. IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT MOST DA SIMPLY WON'T CREATE THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT WISH TO BE FORCED TO DIVERT DEFENDANTS THEY BELIEVE TO BE UNDESERVING. OF HAVING THEIR CRIMES ARE RAISED. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS INEQUITABLE ARBITRARY AND COSTLY AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN OVER. THE TIME. BETWEEN YOU ALSO WANT YOU SORRY -- USE FAR LESS NOT I THINK THANK YOU. MANAGER MEMBERS COREY CELLS -- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OUR POSITION IS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- THE MINUTE THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED IS THAT A PERSON WHO -- IS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME AGAINST. THE CHILD OR THE PERSON WITH WHOM. THE DEFENDANT IS. TRYING TO BE PLACED BACK WITHIN THE HOME. THAT AS WE UNDERSTAND THE THE THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL THAT IF THAT IF THE CRIME IS AGAINST THAT PERSON THAT THEY WOULD NOT THE THE WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM BEING DIVERTED UNDER THIS BILL -- SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND STAFF ON TRYING TO COME TOGETHER WE'VE RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THAT AGAIN -- IT'S JUST I THINK THAT THAT CLEAR SPECIFICATION THAT WHILE DIVERSION MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE WHEN THE VICTIM OF THAT THE ALLEGED VICTIM OF THE CRIME. IS THE PERSON WHO IS SOUGHT TO BE RECONNECTED WITH THE DEFENDANT SO THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR POSITION AND WE ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. STEPHANIE MANN CHAIR MEMBERS RAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION.

GREAT THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER -- SP ONE THIRTY TWO DRESSES A VERY REAL PROBLEM FACING INCARCERATED -- TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS ARE SPECIFICALLY -- I'D TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. WERE BEING HOUSED IN CDC R.. ACCORDING TO THEIR SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH -- AS OPPOSED TO THEIR OWN OUR PERCEPTION OF SAFETY -- OR THEIR GENDER IDENTITY -- AND THIS MISS CLASSIFICATION -- RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANT RISK OF OF VIOLENCE AND FOR EXAMPLE A TRANSGENDER WOMEN WHO ARE OF HOUSE -- OVER THEIR OBJECTION -- IN MAIL FACILITIES THAT ARE THEN -- VICTIMIZED AND THEN A TIMES PLACE IN ISOLATION QUOTE ON QUOTE FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION -- AND SO ON SB ONE THIRTY TO SIX TO ADDRESS -- THIS -- PROBLEM -- BY ENSURING THAT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED ARE TREATED WITH -- BASIC THING ANY -- SO THAT THERE ARE HEALTH AND SAFETY IS RESPECTED AND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. HI IS RESPECTED -- SO THE BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT DURING THE INITIAL INTAKE PROCESS AT CDC ARE. A RECORD OF THE INDIVIDUALS -- AJ SELF REPORTED GENDER IDENTITY -- PREFERRED FIRST NAME AND PRONOUNS AND HONORIFICS -- AND THE PREFERRED GENDER IDENTITY OF IT ANY OFFICER WHO WOULD CONDUCT A BODY SEARCH OF THAT INDIVIDUAL -- REQUIRES STAFF AND CONTRACTORS OF CDC ARE TO CONSISTENTLY USE -- THE GENDER OF PRONOUN HONORIFIC AND NAMED SPECIFIED BY THE INDIVIDUAL AND VERBAL AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS -- IT WILL REQUIRE CDC ARE TO HELL'S OF TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUAL AT A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY DESIGNATED FOR MEN OR WOMEN. ACCORDING TO THAT PERSON'S OWN PERCEPTION OF THE FACILITY THAT WOULD BE SAFEST FOR THEM ROLL TURNITIN BILLY THEIR GENDER IDENTITY ABOUT IS THE SAFEST. IT WILL REQUIRE CDC ARE TO ASSIGN HOUSING PLACEMENT WITH IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. ACCORDING TO A TRANSGENDER PERSONS SENSE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY -- WHICH INCLUDES THE GENDER POPULATION OF THE FACILITY AND ALSO THE TYPE OF HOUSING UNIT. I HOWEVER OF CDC ARE HAS SPECIFIC SECURITY OR MANAGEMENT CONCERNS SB ONE THIRTY TWO DOES ALLOW TO SEE OUR FLEXIBILITY TO OVERRIDE THE PLACEMENT WITHIN THE FACILITY -- AT WHICH THE PERSON HAS BEEN ASSIGNED -- WE KNOW THAT ALMOST 40% OF TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS -- WHO ARE INCARCERATED OUR REPORT -- EXPERIENCING SEXUAL VICTIMIZATION COMPARED TO JUST I IN CALIFORNIA A STUDY OF THE STATE'S PRISON ARE DESIGNATED FOR MEN FOUND THAT THE RATE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FOR TRANSGENDER WOMEN IN THOSE PRISONS -- WAS THIRTEEN TIMES HIGHER THAN FOR MEN IN THE SAME PRESENCE -- TO HOUSE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE IN FACILITIES THAT DO NOT CORRESPOND WITH THEIR PERCEPTION OF THEIR OWN SAFETY OR THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. UP THESE INDIVIDUALS AT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF PHYSICAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL VICTIMIZATION -- AND ALSO REDUCES THEIR ACCESS TO REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS.

ACKNOWLEDGING THE LIMITATIONS THAT DON'T ALLOW FOLKS TO BE IN THIS ROOM TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY I'M GOING TO READ ONE FROM A CURRENTLY INCARCERATED TRANS WOMAN. AND A PHOTO OF HER IS HERE.

HE THREATENED ME WITH VIOLENCE IN THE GRADING PUBLIC HUMILIATION IF I RESISTED TO REFUSE. IF I RESISTED A REFUSED TO COMPLY. AS THE ONE THIRTY TWO IS DESIGNED FOR TRANS WOMEN SUCH AS MYSELF. IT WILL GIVE US THE OPTION TO LIVE WITH OTHERS OF LIKE GENDER A GENDER IDENTITY THAT'S AVOIDING THAT THAT'S AVOIDING BEING PUT IN SITUATIONS I JUST DESCRIBED. I FACE DISCRIMINATION VERBAL ABUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND BULLYING ON AN ONGOING DAILY BASIS.

SAID THANK YOU AND I HOPE YOU VOTE YES ON SB. ONE THIRTY TWO OKAY ACCORDING TO THIS FOUR THIRTY SEVENTHS SO. GO AHEAD -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KELLY LIEU DANS MORE AND I'M THE LEGAL DIRECTOR AT THE TRANS GENDER. GENDER VARIANT INTERSECTS JUSTICE PROJECT AND I ALSO WANT TO SHARE A STATEMENT FROM SOMEBODY -- FROM A TRANSGENDER WOMAN INSIDE A CDC ARE. SINCE OUR TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LISA RENE BRIGGS I AM A TRANSGENDER FEMALE WHO IS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR MEN IN CHINO. I AM WRITING TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR SB -- ONE THIRTY TÃ¬M. DURING MY TIME OF INCARCERATIONS. I HAVE NEVER FELT SAFE I'VE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON TWO OCCASIONS THE FIRST BY A MALE INCARCERATED PERSON WHO ATTACKED ME WHILE I WAS TAKING A SHOWER AND ATTEMPTED TO RAPE ME. THE SECOND BY A CORRECTIONAL LIEUTENANT WHO DURING A SEARCH REPEATEDLY GROPED ME EVEN AFTER I TOLD HIM TO STOP. THE SECOND INCIDENT RESULTED IN ME BEING HELD IN ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION FOR OVER THREE MONTHS. THIS WENT ON UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE IN OUTSIDE ATTORNEY WHO ADVOCATED FOR ME. ON MY BEHALF I WAS THEN RELEASED THE AD SAID PLACEMENT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN RETALIATION. THESE PAST EXPERIENCES MAKE ME VERY HESITANT TO REPORT ANY FURTHER SEXUAL ASSAULTS ARE HARASSMENTS. I'VE BEEN DE GENDERED AND SEXUALLY HARASSED DAILY DURING MY INCARCERATION BY BOTH INCARCERATED PEOPLE AS WELL AS STAFF. HOWEVER MY STORY IS NOWHERE NEAR AS BAD OR TRAUMATIC AS MANY OTHERS. I ADVOCATE FOR MY SISTERS AND MYSELF BEHIND BARS AT MY CURRENT INSTITUTION I HAD TO FIGHT FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE TO HAVE. SEPARATED SHOWER TIMES AS WELL AS MODESTY SCREENS SO THAT THOSE WHO WISH TO COULD SHOOT COULD SHOWER SEPARATELY FROM THE MAIL INCARCERATED PEOPLE. WHO IS SEXUALLY HARASS US ON A REGULAR BASIS? I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO MY TIME FREE FROM SEXUAL AND VERBAL HARASSMENT AND BE RESPECTED FOR HOWEVER IDENTIFY. I WOULD PREFER TO FINISH MY REMAINING TERM OF INCARCERATION AT A FEMALE INSTITUTION WHERE I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND SAFE I THEREFORE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY TWO GIVING ME HOPE THAT I CAN DO MY TIME SAFELY THANK YOU -- OUR DEAR [inaudible] ANY OTHER. IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION. MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. RESIDENTS ALSO ME HALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

JENNIFER OR THE ONE ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH ONE OCCUR OWNED A LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE IN PRISON. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AND OUR SPONSOR THIS BILL. GOING BACK IS FOR ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OTHER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YES COULD YOU MAKE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SURE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ABIGAIL INADA. I AM A DEMOCRAT. A FEMINIST AND AN ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS. I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF SB ONE THIRTY TWO AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN BECOMES LAW. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL SANCTION THE DESIRE OF MALE RAPISTS. TO SHARE QUARTERS WITH FEMALE INMATES. LEST YOU THINK THIS IS HYPERBOLE. IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. RIGHT NOW RICHARD MÃ¡S BROKE A TRANS IDENTIFIED MAIL. IS CURRENTLY HOUSED WITH FEMALE INMATES IN CORONA CALIFORNIA. EVEN THOUGH HE IS SERVING TIME FOR TARGETING RAPING. AND TORTURING WOMEN. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS THIS MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE. THIS BILL PERMITS MALE INMATES TO BE HOUSED WITH FEMALE INMATES AT THE MERE REQUEST OF A MAIL IN MEAT. EVEN THOUGH MALES COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES THREE TIMES MORE OFTEN THAN WOMEN. AND THERE ARE NO STUDIES TO SHOW THAT MALES WHO SELF IDE AS TRANS COMMIT LESS VIOLENT CRIMES RELATIVE. TO THE GENERAL MALE POPULATION. THIS BILL PROVIDES NO EXCEPTIONS FOR MALE INMATES WHO HAVE COMMITTED VIOLENT CRIMES OR CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN. INCLUDING RAPE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER ANATOMY A DIAGNOSIS OF GENDER DYSPHORIA OR A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A MAIL IN MAY TWO PHYSICALLY PRESENT AS A WOMAN TAKES STEPS TO MEDICALLY TRANSITION NOR EVEN TO PREFER FEMININE PRONOUNS. ALL THAT IS REQUIRED ACCORDING TO THIS BILL IS A MALE INMATES DESIRE TO BE HOUSED WITH WOMEN. EVEN IF THAT MAIL IS INCARCERATED FOR SEXUAL CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN. IF PASSED. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AN INCREASE LEGAL SETTLEMENTS. THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS ALREADY KNOWN TO HAVE A VERY HIGH RATE OF SEX HARASSMENT CLAIMS WHICH HAS COST TAXPAYERS MILLIONS IN COURT BATTLES. WHERE LAWS LIKE SB ONE THIRTY TO HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED IT HAS RESULTED IN MALE INMATES SEXUALLY ASSAULTING FEMALE INMATES? THE POLICY HAS BEEN SO EGREGIOUS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO ROLL BACK THEIR SELF ID POLICY. IN ORDER TO PROTECT FEMALE INMATES FROM FURTHER SEXUAL ASSAULT. THEY HAVE SINCE ESTABLISHED A SEPARATE TRANS GENDER UNIT. TO PROTECT ALL INMATES. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE DRAFTING THIS BILL. LOOK INTO OTHER PLACES WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING [inaudible] TO COMPARE. THE GOAL TO PRESERVE THE SAFETY OF TRANS IDENTIFIED INMATES IS A NOBLE. ONE BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA'S FEMALE INMATE POPULATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU YES SIR. SURE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY MY NAME IS GREG BIRCH I WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL -- MISS LOW LUNA -- DID A GREAT JOB EXPLAINING HOW THIS BILL TRIES TO SOLVE A LEGITIMATE PROBLEM WITH THE TERRIBLE SOLUTION. THAT PUTS VULNERABLE WOMEN INMATES AT RISK. BUT I WANT TO TRY AND GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE THE AVERAGE PERSON. I CHALLENGE YOU TO JUST RANDOMLY WALK UP TO SOMEONE ON THE STREET AND ASK THEM WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT LEADING MAIL IN MAYES DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO BE HOUSE WITH WOMEN. AND WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT MEN HERE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ANY BIOLOGICAL WOMEN DECIDE THEY WOULD RATHER BE HOUSE IN THE MEN'S PRISON. HERE'S SOME COMMENTS I PULLED FROM FACEBOOK IN REACTION TO THIS BILL. THIS CANNOT BE TRUE. THIS IS SO STUPID I GIVE UP. JUST ANOTHER INSANE IDEA IN CALIFORNIA. HERE'S A COMMENT. I HAVE A SISTER THAT WORKS IN THE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM AND SHE TOLD ME STORIES ABOUT MEN SAYING THEY WERE WOMEN TO GET INTO THE WOMEN'S PRISON AND THEN ATTACKING WOMEN THERE. WHAT A FIASCO THIS WILL BE IT ALSO GIVES PRISONERS A HOLDOVER GUARDS IN OFFICIALS WITH THAT FURTHER CLOGS UP THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WITH FOR THE MOST FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS? OF THE CON ARTISTS IN PRISON ARE LAUGHING NOW. HOW ABOUT THIS ONE HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS GOING TO HAVE A GREAT TIME IN PRISON ALL HAS TO DO IS SAY I'M A FEMALE AND HE'LL BE HOUSE WITH THE FEMALES? SEXUAL ABUSE -- HERE COMES THIS THERE WAS A ONE COMMENT FROM A PERSON WHO THOUGHT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S YOU ARE LIVING IN A BUBBLE IF YOU THINK CALIFORNIA VOTERS WANT THIS. COMMONSENSE SCREAMS OUT. THIS IS A REALLY REALLY BAD IDEA. AND I'LL WRAP UP HERE -- IF YOU PASS THIS IN GOVERNOR NUISANCE SIGNS IT HERE'S WHAT I HOPE HAPPENS THE FIRST DAY THE BILL GOES INTO EFFECT. I HOPE EVERY MALE IN ME ALL AT ONCE DECLARE THEMSELVES TO BE A WOMAN AND ASKED TO BE HOUSING THE WOMAN'S PRISON WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SUCH A SITUATION COMPLETE CHAOS ONCE TO THE VOTERS THE COUNTRY WILL HANG THEIR HEADS IN SHAME. KNOWING THAT THE STATE IN THIS UNION WOULD BE WILLING TO PASS A BILL LIKE THIS IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT WOMEN SAFETY YOU'LL OPPOSE SB ONE THIRTY TWO SO PLEASE PLEASE VOTE NOW. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISS REBEKAH POWER QUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE PROTECT OUR TRANS COMMUNITY IN OUR PRISONS AND I THINK YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. BUT I THINK THE OPPOSITION RAISES A SERIOUS CONCERN BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR PRISON POPULATION THAT ARE NOT HONEST ACTORS. AND HOW DO WE PREVENT FROM WRONGDOING ON THOSE PARTS OF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IS THERE SOMETHING IN THE BILL PROTECTS ABOUT IT WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE THANK YOU -- SO -- I COULD SEE A LOT OF THINGS TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. BY THE OPPOSITION -- AND IF YOU -- WANT TO HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING FOR WHY IT IS SO HARD TO BE A TRANSGENDER PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY. OR IN THIS WORLD OR WHY TRANS PEOPLE WHY WE KNOW THAT JUST JUST THIS MONTH OF JUNE FOR TRANS WOMEN OF FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN TRANS WOMEN. HAVE BEEN MURDERED TRUST IN THE MONTH OF JUNE WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF TRANS WOMEN IN PARTICULAR IN THIS COUNTRY BEING BRUTALIZED AND MURDERED. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CONVERSATION AROUND THIS BILL GIVES YOU A GLIMPSE INTO THAT. AND WE THOUGHT PLAY ALL AND EVERY ARGUMENT WE HEAR TODAY. WAS MADE IN JUSTIFICATION IN SUPPORT OF THE NORTH CAROLINA BATHROOM BILL IF YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE NEWS THAT TRANS PEOPLE ARE ALL SOCIOPATHS. THE TRANS PEOPLE JUST BECOME TRANS SO THEY CAN. GO INTO WOMEN'S BATHROOM -- AND RAPED AND MOLESTED WOMEN REMEMBER THOSE ARGUMENTS THAT WE WERE HEARING OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA AND REMEMBER THE JUSTIFIED NATIONAL BACKLASH. AGAINST DOT PERSPECTIVE -- THAT TRANSPORT NOT REALLY TRANSIT JUST CAN USE TRICKERY AND TO SAY OF PAY -- ARE IDENTIFIED AS A WOMAN IN ORDER TO GET ACCESS TO SOMETHING -- THIS IS A POPULATION THAT IS. KNOWS IS SO INCREDIBLY MARGINALIZED IN OUR SOCIETY AND PARTICULARLY IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND WE COULD GIVE YOU I DON'T HAVE TO I DON'T HAVE TO READ FACEBOOK. COMMENTS TO YOU TO SHOW YOU THE STATISTICS OF HELL BRUTALIZED TRANSFERABLE ARE IN PRISON TRANSFORM THE ONES BRUTALIZING OTHER PEOPLE THEY ARE THE ONES BEING VICTIMIZED AND THIS BILL WILL HELP. PROTECT THEM. THE BILL PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR CDC ARE IF THERE IS A SPECIFIC SECURITY CONCERN ABOUT INDIVIDUAL. TO TAKE ACTION. IT'S IF THAT'S WRITTEN INTO THE BILL -- BUT I I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS BEING ARTICULATED. AND THERE'S I DON'T THINK ANY SUBSTANCE TO IT -- AND SO -- WE'RE ALL CONCERNED WITH THE SECURITY OF ALL OF OUR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. BY THE VICTIMIZATION OF HAPPENING. IS TRANSGENDER BEING PEOPLE BEING VICTIMIZED BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE ARE TREATING THEM AND OUR PRISON SYSTEM. THANK YOU KNOW I I HAVE TO AGREE AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. WE HEAR COMMENTS ALL THE TIME TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHY WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR TRANS COMMUNITIES AND I THINK ESPECIALLY IN PRISONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE VICTIMIZED. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PROTECTING THEM AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF CDC ARE SO IF THERE IS SOMEONE. AS DESCRIBED BY THE FIRST OPPOSITION WITNESS WHO -- IS NOT A FACTOR THAN THEY WANTED SO THANK YOU. AND CRAP YEAH AND FOR THE IF YOU WANT SOME OF THOSE STATISTICS ALSO -- ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY UC IRVINE 59% OF TRANS WOMEN HELD IN MEN'S PRISONS WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED COMPARED 24% OF JUSTICE PEOPLE IN THE MEN'S PRISONS. AND THE NATIONALLY TRANS PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED ARE FIVE TO SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION TO BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY FACILITY STAFF. AND NINE TO TEN STE NINE TO TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY ANOTHER INCARCERATED PERSON. AND SO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT FOLKS ARE GOING TO GO INTO WOMEN'S PRISONS AND DO WHAT THEY ARE DESCRIBING IS IS IS VERY UNLIKELY AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A MORE. IN DEPTH LOOK AT HOW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ACTUALLY TREATING TRANSPORT A HOT TRANSPORT TREATING PEOPLE IN WATER INCARCERATED -- AND SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT AWESOME. THANKS AGAIN IT HAPPENED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHEN THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. GENDER SELF ID AS SOON AS IT WAS IMPLEMENTED THERE WERE SEXUAL ASSAULTS. THAT WERE DONE. IMPLEMENT THAT WERE. TRANSLATE INTO FIVE MALES DID THAT TO WOMEN THAT IS WHY THEY CREATED A SEPARATE. UNIT. IT HAPPENED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. AND COME OVER. TO MAKING HER -- BRINGING THIS ARM I THINK RATHER IDEALISTIC BILL -- TO THE ASSEMBLY I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS MYSELF I AM NOT. A AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PHRASE THIS APPROPRIATELY I DON'T KNOW IF I'M AS CONCERNED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE STATISTICS THAT ARE OUT THERE ABOUT TRANS REGARDLESS OF YOUR INCARCERATED OR NOT OKAY BEING TRAUMATIZED AND ASSAULTED. BUT I DO SORT OF QUESTION -- WHAT'S IN THE BILL WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGES IN THE BILL THAT REALLY TALKS TO THOSE FOLKS WHO PURPORT TO BE TRANS -- WHO MAY WANT TO FIND THEIR WAY INTO A PARTICULAR FACILITY -- TO DO TO CREATE ALL KIND OF MAYHEM -- SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR AND THE EXPERTS. ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF THE PRISON SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATE THIS I THINK IT'S MUCH BROADER THAN A PRONOUN I THINK WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT GOING TO FIX IT BUT HOPEFULLY IT WILL START A DIALOGUE. IS INCREDIBLY ACUTELY ACCURATE -- BUT I JUST AM CURIOUS ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT. BECAUSE WE REALLY SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO HAVE A CULTURE CHANGE WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM. YOU KNOW THERE ARE TRANS FOLKS WERE BEING ASSAULTED AND MOLESTED AND RAPED BUT THEY'RE ALSO SAYS WOMEN -- AND MEN WHO ARE BEING YOU KNOW. ASSAULTED AND RAPED AND THEN BASED ON YOUR ETHNICITY. YOU HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE FOLKS ARE BEING TARGETED IF THEY'RE NOT FROM THE SAME GANG IF THEY'RE FROM A DIFFERENT GANG IF THEY'RE A DIFFERENT RACE OR IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT ETHNICITY OR A DIFFERENT RELIGION. I MEAN ALL OF THIS KIND OF TRAUMA IS HAPPENING YOU KNOW IN THESE -- PRISON SYSTEMS AND I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT CDC ARE HAS THE CAPACITY TO EVEN MANAGES ACTS. SO I JUST WONDER BECAUSE YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY THAT CDC OUR HOUSE IF YOU CAN KIND OF SPEAK TO THE BROADER ISSUE BECAUSE MY FEAR IS THAT WE THEN HAVE THIS HAPPEN. AND I DON'T WANT TO GET MORE STATS ARE REPORTS ABOUT MORE TRANS FOLKS BEING HURT BECAUSE WE'VE SORT OF CHANGED A SYSTEM THAT REALLY ISN'T. PREPARED AND THEN SAID OKAY LET'S CREATE THE IDEAL IN THE REAL. AND THEN WE HAVE MORE CHAOS BECAUSE THAT'S I MEAN YOU KNOW DOING THAT I THINK IS EQUAL TO ACTUALLY DOING NOTHING AND SAYING YOU KNOW SCREW YOU YOU'RE INCARCERATED DEAL WITH IT. YEAH AND JUST SO IN IN CRAFTING THIS AND OBVIOUSLY WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH A A BROAD COALITION -- BY INCLUDING WITH. TRANS PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED OR WERE INCARCERATED WHO UNDERSTAND ON THE GROUND. WHAT IS GOING TO PROTECT THEIR SAFETY SO IT DOT? WHAT HOWARD PRACTICE WAS NOT DONE IN A IN A VACUUM? I AND AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL ALSO CREATES FLEXIBILITY -- THAT A TRANS PERSONS OWN SENSE OF SAFETY AND HEALTH IS. IS FACTORED IN -- CDC ARE -- WE HAVE BEEN REGULARLY MEETING WITH CDC ARE -- STARTING BEFORE WE INTRODUCE THIS BILL SIGNED LAST YEAR I NCDC ARW I GOT I DON'T I DON'T SPEAK FOR CC I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM BUT THEY REPORT TO US THAT THEY WANT TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION IN FACT THEY HAVE A WORKING GROUP. INTERNALLY ON TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION -- AND SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE ENCOUNTERING A AGENCY THAT IS SAYING NO WE CAN'T OR DON'T WANT TO DO THIS THEY WANT TO GET THEIR ON'T. CLEARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM AROUND VIOLENCE AND MANY MANY OTHER ISSUES. AND I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND SAY SB ONE THIRTY TWO IS GOING TO LIE TO MAGICALLY FIX AT ALL STILL GONNA TAKE A LOT OF WORK WITH THIS IS. ONE STOP -- FOR ONE INMATE POPULATION THAT HAS A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND SO I THINK THAT THIS WILL NOT SOLVE EVERYTHING BUT MOVE US IN A GOOD DIRECTION I DON'T KNOW IF -- IF MACHE OR NOT YEAH YEAH AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY IT ISN'T GOING TO FIX EVERYTHING AND I THINK IT'S REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE DIALOGUE AROUND. WHO TRANS PEOPLE ARE AND LIKE THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT THEY FACE ALL INCARCERATED WHICH IS VERY RECENT THAT'S COME UP TO THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK WHAT MAKES? OUR WORK ON THIS BILL SO IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'RE DOING ON THE GROUND DIRECT SUPPORT TO INCARCERATED PEOPLE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH CDC ARE AND THEN TRYING TO PUSH FOR STATEWIDE LEGISLATION AND SO. ALL THREE OF THOSE MERGING FACTORS I THINK ARE CRAFTING -- A PROCESS AND CRAFTING QUICK SORT OF A SOLUTION THAT'S GONNA HELP INCARCERATED TRANS FOLKS IF THIS BILL WERE TO BE PASSED AND SO IT'S I THINK THE REALLY TRANSPARENT AND HONEST CONVERSATIONS ARE HAVING CCDC ARE ARE HAVE BEEN REALLY HELPFUL AND LIKE DETERMINING. HOW WE WOULD SCREEN PEOPLE FROM? FROM BECAUSE LIKE FOR PREDATORY PEOPLE FROM GOING INTO WOMEN'S UNLIKELY IT COULD BE A POSSIBILITY AND WE ARE TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND SO I THINK -- WE ARE HAVING ONGOING DIALOGUE AND I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- WERE REALLY REALLY TRYING TO BE INTENTIONAL WITH THIS BILL. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS YOU KNOW I GONNA JUST ADD THAT YOU KNOW I'M SKEPTICAL BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GET IN THE WAY OF TRYING AND YOU WON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY. AND THEN YOU JUST MOVE FROM THERE [inaudible] MR MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE PULLING UP THE OPPOSITION STUFF WITHOUT THE SOLUTION THAT THEY DID IN. THE U. K.. THEY ENDED UP DOING A SEPARATE FACILITY FOR TRANS GENDERED. AND MY QUESTION SENATORS HOW COME WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT DOING THAT -- YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF RUNNING THIS LEGISLATION RUN SOMETHING TO SET UP ME EITHER SEPARATE BLOCK. OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES TO HAVE A SEPARATE. I MEAN IF THIS SONY MESSED UP THEY'RE GOING TO PRISON THEIR GOING TO PRISON CELL. DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT DOING LIKE A SEVER PRESENT FOR TRANS GENDER TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ALL THE NEEDS IN FACILITIES AND PROTECTIONS AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED. AND THAT THOSE CORRECTIONAL GUARDS THERE HAVE SPECIAL TRAINING TO ENSURE THEY KNOW HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE. I MEAN THEY SHOULD BE TREATING PEOPLE RIGHT ANYWAY BUT JUST TO REALLY ENSURE THAT EVERYTHING'S THERE AND ALL THE NEEDS ARE MET. YES SO I MEAN THAT'S I I'M JUST WONDERING WHY WE'RE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION WHEN WE KNOW THERE'S A MODEL OVER HERE WE KNOW THERE WAS PROBLEMS OVER HERE. INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT OKAY THIS IS HOW THEY SOLVED IT. AND NOW THINGS ARE BETTER THERE WHY WE ARE JUST LOOKING AT LESSONS LEARNED FROM OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE WE DO WITH A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. BECAUSE TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN TRANSGENDER MATT -- AND I DON'T SO I DON'T THINK YOU -- THE SALE CREATED. FOR A TRANSGENDER PRISON WERE OVER SAYING IS THAT IF YOU'RE TRANSFORM AND YOUR WOMAN. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE HOUSED AS A WOMAN AND BY I UNDERSTAND THAT'S THAT YOUR FEELINGS ON A WERE TALKING ABOUT PRISON POPULATIONS AND SUB CULTURES THAT ALL HAVE THEIR OWN VERY. DIFFERENT FEELINGS WITHIN THOSE JUSTICE -- MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE POINTED OUT EVEN IN REGULAR PRESENCE YOU STILL HAVE GANG MEMBERS. RACIAL RIGHTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAPPENING WE'RE REYES AND THESE THINGS ARE STILL HAPPENING. SO I MEAN WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE SUBCULTURES WITHIN THE PRESENT OVERNIGHT. AND I AM I AM NOT -- MY OPINIONS ON ON ON IT IT. IS GOING TO CHANGE THE SUBCULTURE WHAT. IF OUR OUR JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE. ADVERTISE POPULATION SAY. YEAH WE'RE NOT TRYING TO AS I STATED TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEM AND PRISONS OFFICER THERE MANY PROBLEMS -- BUT WE'RE LOOKING ADDRESS ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE -- GUY TRANSGENDER AND CAR SERRATED PEOPLE ARE BEING. I THOUGHT [inaudible] I NOT HOUSE CORRECTLY. AMONG OTHER THINGS -- WHICH LEADS TO INCREASED VIOLENCE AGAINST SOME AND OTHER PROBLEMS WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS A ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE. BROADER AND OTHER ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. YEAH AND I THINK IT'S A COALITION A COMMUNITY LIKE. NOT AT ALL WOULD BE ONE ADVOCATE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW PRISON LIKE WE WOULDN'T WANT TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW FACILITY FOR TRANS PEOPLE LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM. AND I THINK ADVOCATING FOR A SEPARATE FACILITY FOR THEIR STIGMATIZES FURTHER MARGINALIZES OUR COMMUNITY -- BY SAYING THAT. LIKE WHERE A WHOLE DIFFERENT LIKE ENTITY AND LIKE. JUST MAKES US LIKE. IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE ALIENS OR SOMETHING LIKE WE HAVE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A WHOLE DIFFERENT PLACE AND IT'S LIKE. PRISON RAPE IS STILL HAPPENING WOMEN'S FACILITIES REGARDLESS OF TRANS WOMEN WEAR TRANSFERRED THERE ARE NOT BY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND BY OTHER PEOPLE WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES AND SO I CAN'T REITERATE ENOUGH THAT. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT VALIDATING THE EXPERIENCES OF TRANS PEOPLE AS TRANSAMINASES WOMEN AND TRANS MEN AS MEN -- AND SO I WANTED TO REPEAT THAT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT REYES HAPPENS USING THEM YOU DON'T ASK THEM QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND ARE YOU HE DONE. NOW IS THE SAME THANK. OF AND THEN -- ANYMORE QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS I'D I'D IS AND WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT LESSONS LEARNED OKAY YOU -- ANYMORE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK. AND SO I I LOOK I I CAN SEE PART OF THE THE DILEMMA -- THAT MAYBE SOME MAY HAVE. OF EVEN THE OPPOSITION I CAN CAN CONSIDER CONCERN [inaudible] OF LOOK. THE THERE WAS A TIME. WHERE MY UNCLE COULDN'T GO TO THE SAME SCHOOL? AS WHITE SKIDS BECAUSE IT WOULD MONGOL ICE. OR AFTER AMERICAN MALES WOULD RAPE WHITE WOMEN DICTATE WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER. LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL. WHENEVER PEOPLE MAKING THOSE CLAIMS -- BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. AFTER AMERICAN. WHITE KIDS COMING TOGETHER IN THE SCHOOL AND LEARNING TOGETHER. I THINK WE'RE JUST NOW REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TRANS COMMUNITY THIS IS ALL. NEW TO US AND HOW. ON THE TRANS COMMUNITY THANKS HOLLY OPERATE. AND WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH. SOME THINGS THAT NATURE THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS TO I I CAN LET THE OPPOSITION NOW -- CCPOA AND I'VE. THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION I ASKED HIM ABOUT. YOU KNOW TRANSCEND OF ISSUES THAT ARE IN CARS RATED AND HOW COULD YOU. ARE YOU ABLE TO TELL. AND THEY EVIDENTLY HAVE SOME VERY VERY -- ANY PARTY REASON YOU HAVE THIS BILL THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO IDENTIFY AND IMPRISON PICTURED YOUR TRANS. AND SO -- CCPOA MEMBERS HAVE TOLD ME WE KNOW AND WE CAN MAKE SURE. THAT INDIVIDUALS AND NOW. EIGHTY SO OUT OUT. HOW QUICKLY MAKE MY STATEMENTS? SO WE GET TO THE VOTE -- BUT CCPOA NEEDS TO MOVE TO THE NEXT DIRECTION I BELIEVE THEY ARE WILLING TO MOVE WITH ALL THE SECURITY. CONSIDERATIONS THEY ARE THEY'RE BETTER EQUIPPED AT BRING IN THIS AND IF THEY NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO COME BACK ON ME IN THE END OF COMMITTEE HIGH MAN. TO TRY -- TO MAKE SURE OF FACILITY I'M NOT CERTAIN -- GO WITH A SEPARATE FACILITY BUT THEY WILL COME UP WITH A MECHANISM THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY AND KEEP EVERYONE SAFE FROM WITH THAT I RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE.
