BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.424

A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO BE

ABLE TO. AND WE CAN'T JUST

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:23.128
CHANGE PEOPLE'S WHOLE WAYS OF

LIFE WITHOUT PROVIDING SOME

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:25.897
KIND OF ALTERNATIVE RIGHT IT

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.465
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE NOR DOES IT

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:28.266
SEEM EQUITABLE IN THE STATE OF

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:30.101
CALIFORNIA. I GUESS IT'S ALL MY

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:31.369
QUESTIONS AROUND SOME OF THE

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:32.370
ISSUES THAT YOU'RE ALREADY

00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:35.640
RAISED- BUT THEN I GUESS JUST

00:24:35.707 --> 00:24:37.108
CURIOUS AS SOMEBODY WHO'S LIVED

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:39.010
AND WORKED AROUND AG WHY THE

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:41.446
DECISION TO DO. THIS OR THAT

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:43.481
THE GRANT PROGRAM TO DEVELOPER

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:45.116
FELLOW GROUND BUT AT THE SAME

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:46.418
TIME THE WILLIAMSON ACT WHY DO

00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:48.220
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. TOGETHER

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:50.222
AT THE SAME TIME. AND THEN MY

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:51.156
OTHER QUESTIONS ARE JUST

00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:54.960
AROUND- THE ACTUAL PURPOSES I'M

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:56.428
I'M SURE AT SOME POINT IT'LL BE

00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:58.296
DELINEATED OUT- BUT FOR SOME

00:24:58.363 --> 00:24:59.130
THINGS THAT ARE THAT CAN STILL

00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:00.298
BE WATER INTENSIVE WHEN WE

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:01.833
THINK ABOUT RANGE LAND AND

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.934
CATTLE AND THINGS LIKE THAT

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.369
AND- NOT THAT I DON'T LIVE A

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:05.537
GOOD BURGERS MUCH AS ANYBODY

00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:07.138
ELSE BUT- WE ALSO UNDERSTAND

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:09.241
THAT- THE- THE- THE WEAR AND

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:10.575
TEAR ON THE LAND WITH SOME OF

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:11.977
THE ACTIVITIES THAT. ARE

00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:13.111
ASSOCIATED WITH HIS NON

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:18.817
IRRIGATED LAND. AND THEN AT THE

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:19.451
SAME TIME I WE STILL. WE'RE IS

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:20.785

WHATEVER NEW PROGRAMSARE

00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:28.059
PUTTING IN. INDEED HAS A

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:29.661
LIGHTER FOOTPRINT AND HOW HOW

00:25:29.728 --> 00:25:31.696
LIKE THAT FOOTPRINT IT'S GOING

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:33.798
TO CREATE. BUT THOSE ARE SOME

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:34.699
GREAT QUESTIONS AND AS THE

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:35.901
CHAIR MENTIONED- THESE ARE

00:25:35.967 --> 00:25:37.569
ISSUES THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:38.470
THROUGH I THINK THE MONITORING

AND REPORTING IS VERY- YOU KNOW

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:41.907
IN A PARK CONCEPT OF THE BILL

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:44.576
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW-

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:46.111

IN EMPHASIZING THIS PROGRAM.

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:54.052
FOR THOSE REGIONS- IS NOT THE

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:55.820
HEART OF THIS KIND OF THIS

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:58.523
BILL. AS FAR AS- THE RECENT

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.859
CHANGES WE'VE HAD- AS A RELEASE

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:02.227

BECAUSE THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT

00:26:21.112 --> 00:26:23.615

ARE IMPACTED. SEVERELY BY THIS

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:33.058
DROUGHT- AND THE ONE THING THAT

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:33.959
IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS

00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:37.529
DROUGHT. IS IS HAVING TO WORK

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:39.030
THROUGH CIGNA- AND IT'S-

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:41.733

WHERE THE- YOU KNOW. HUNDREDS

00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:53.745
OF THOUSAND ACRES IN THE SALAD

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:56.815

INCLUSION OF THAT LANGUAGE-

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:09.227
WE'RE AIMING TO ENSURE THAT.

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:11.496
EXISTING LINES NOT CONTRACT OR

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:12.530

PROGRAM WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:25.110
LAND USE AS- AN A CONTRACT THEN

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:26.845

OTHERS FOR GOING FOR THE STATE

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:57.375
HAS HAS AT NOT BEEN A TO UPHOLD

00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:58.743
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IN

00:27:58.810 --> 00:27:59.944
PAYMENTS OF WILLIAMSON ACT FOR

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:00.912
THE LAST FEW YEARS AND

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:02.981
HOPEFULLY- AS WE'RE ADDING NEW

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:04.215
THINGS AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT A

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:05.950
WAY. HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR WE

00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:07.185
HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY BUT WILL

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:09.087
CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS. TO

00:28:09.154 --> 00:28:11.022
PAY FOR OUR OUR FAIR SHARE OF

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:14.092
THAT- OF THAT PROGRAM SO IT'S-

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.627
REALLY INTERESTING WORK I WILL

00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:17.295
BE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THIS

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:20.131
GOES FORWARD- AND IT WAS- I WAS

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:21.433
IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:23.701
PASSED A- SIGMA WHICH- EVERYONE

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:24.636
THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS COMING TO

00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:27.839
AN END BUT- AS WE- LOOK BACK I

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:28.773
THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY SEE.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.175
THAT WE DID IT THAT PROBABLY AT

00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:31.576
THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT TO DO

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:33.812
IT. AND STILL BE ABLE TO GO ON

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:34.412
TO JUST THINK WHERE WE'D BE IF

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:36.114
WE HADN'T PASSED THAT. IN THIS

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.315
KIND OF DROUGHT THAT WE'RE

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.050
HEADING INTO NOW. THAT AT LEAST

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:40.351
WERE ABLE TO START TO MAKE

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:42.287
PLANS. TO REALIZE WHAT WE HAVE

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:43.822
DONE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.557
VERY INTERESTING AND I THINK

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:46.858
RIGHT THE SPACE SO WE NEED TO

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:47.759
BE WORKING IS. HOW DO WE

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:48.893
CONTINUE TO MAKE CALIFORNIA

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.763
AGRICULTURE WORKING AREA. GOING

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.165
FORWARD UNDER NEW CONDITIONS.

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:54.732
THANK YOU SENATOR AGAIN SENT

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:59.104
EARLIER. I'M REMINDED OF THE

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.606
LAST SCENE AND MOONSTRUCK WHERE

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:04.008
THE FATHER JUST GOES JUST SO

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:07.212
CONFUSED. BECAUSE THIS IS

00:29:07.278 --> 00:29:11.483
MOVING SO FAST AND YOU READ THE

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:12.951
ANALYSIS BUT THAT AMENDMENTS

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:14.786
COME AND THE AMENDMENTS IN SOME

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:15.920
WAYS ON AMENDMENTS IT'S AN

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:17.789
AGREEMENT TO DO SOMETHING IN

00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:18.923
THE FUTURE AND TRY TO WORK IT

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.593
OUT. AND THIS MIGHT BE OUR ONLY

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:26.231
BITE AT THIS APPLE AND SO- AND

00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:28.266
I'M GLAD FOR THE CLARIFICATION

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:29.200
TO THE EXTENT IT WAS A

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:30.768
CLARIFICATION ON THE WILLIAMSON

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.604
ACT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.038
THAT IS STILL AN ISSUE THAT IS

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:35.006
GOING TO BE AN ISSUE AND IT

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:36.341
MIGHT BE AN ISSUE COMING FROM

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:38.843
THE OTHER DIRECTION. NOT JUST

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.812
THAT SOMEBODY PAYS HIGHER TAXES

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:42.780
BUT THIS BILL MIGHT PROTECT

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:44.482
THEM AND THE WILLIAMSON ACT

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:46.551
MIGHT PROTECT THEM SO WHY IS

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:47.785
THERE A DUPLICATION OF

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:49.654
PROTECTION AT THE END I THINK

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:53.158
THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:55.093
BE ADDRESSED IN THIS. AS WELL.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.829
AND I WALKED INTO THIS HEARING.

00:29:57.896 --> 00:29:59.764
NOT AWARE THAT SOME OF THE

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:00.331
STUFF WHAT WOULD BE TALKED

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:02.700
ABOUT. WITH THE CONCERN THAT I

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:04.602
WAS GOING TO DRILL DOWN ON.

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:09.507
WHICH IS THAT- IT THERE'S THE

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:13.278
WHOLE ISSUE OF TAKING LAND OUT

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.947
OF USED TO RE PURPOSE BUT

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.382
THERE'S NO STATEMENT IN THE

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:20.285
BILL AS TO WHETHER THAT'S

00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:22.921
REQUIRED FOR HOW LONG AND IF

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.189
THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS

00:30:24.255 --> 00:30:26.591
ACCRUING TO SOMEBODY AND THEN

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.526
NO COMMITMENT TO SORT OF DO

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:29.994
WHAT'S ON THE OTHER HALF OF

00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.663
THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE OPEN

00:30:31.729 --> 00:30:32.497
ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:33.865
ADDRESSED I SORT OF GATHERED

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:37.001
FROM THE SHIP. CHAIR'S COMMENTS.

00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:38.469
THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:39.571
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS

00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:42.173
OVER THE NEXT MONTH. AND I

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.209
RECOGNIZE HOW FUNNY THAT IS

00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:47.111
JUST ON THE GROUND BECAUSE

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:50.281
IT'S- IF THEY WISH THE

00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:52.183
LANDOWNER WISHES TO RE PURPOSE

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.919
FOR ANOTHER REASON. IT'S LIKE

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:57.422
HOW DOES THAT WORK. IF THE

00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:58.590
LANDOWNER WAS GOING TO RE

00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:01.593
PURPOSE ANYWAY WHY SHOULD WE

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:03.361
SORT OF EXTEND SOMETHING TO

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:04.896
THEM FOR SOMETHING THEY WERE

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:08.366
GOING TO DO ANYWAY. IF IT TURNS

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:11.469
OUT THE DEAD BECAUSE OF SIGMA

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.404
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER AND

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:15.173
THEN UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.775
SIGMA ONCE YOU DO THE PLAN AND

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.344
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY FORTY

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.278
YOU GO WHEN YOU TRY TO FIND

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.447
ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF WATER AS

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:24.549
WELL AS CUTTING BACK. WHAT IF

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:27.285
AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF WATER

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:29.487
IS FOUND OR DEVELOPED. AND WE

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:32.824
HAVE PAID SOMEBODY. TO TAKE

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.292
LAND OUT OF USE AND THERE MIGHT

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:35.860
BE WATER TO BRING IT BACK INTO

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.528
THE USE THAT WAS THE PRE

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.931
EXISTING USE HOW DOES THAT FIT

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:43.368
INTO THIS WHOLE SCHEME SO I

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:45.937
THINK THAT THERE'S ALMOST AS

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:48.072
MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. R.

00:31:48.139 --> 00:31:50.108
AS ANSWERED IN THE ONE BENEFIT

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:52.477
BY TAKING THE CHAIRS OUR

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:54.545
RECOMMENDATION ADDITIONALLY. IS

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:55.613
THAT THE BUDGET MIGHT ACTUALLY

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.515
BE FINALIZED BY THE TIME THAT

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:58.683
WE DO ACTION AND THERE'S A

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.551
CHANCE THAT THERE'S SOME MONEY

00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:01.986
IN THE BUDGET THAT ADDRESSES

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:03.621
THIS AND THEN YOU COULD LINE UP

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:05.290
THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:08.626
THIS AND HAVE A CLEAR IDEA. OF

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:11.095
WHAT IS DOING AND SO GIVEN THAT

00:32:11.162 --> 00:32:12.830
GENERAL STATE OF MOVING TARGET

00:32:12.897 --> 00:32:15.700
AND CONFUSION R. R. I WOULD

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:18.803
JUST SAY. THAT I HOPE THAT THE

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.140
OUTCOME OF THE WILLIAMSON ACT.

00:32:22.206 --> 00:32:25.943
DOES IT AT BOTH BANDS. DOESN'T

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.614
SORT OF- BECOME AN INHIBITOR TO

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:31.849
DO THIS AND IN A WAY THAT

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:33.818
THAT'S PROTECTED IN A WHITE TO

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.987
ALLOWED TO DO THIS BUT IF IT'S

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:38.289
SORT OF A DOUBLE PROTECTION IS

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:40.058
THERE A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:42.260
AND THEN ON THE ISSUE OF THE

00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:43.928
USE IF SOMEBODY IS GIVEN AN

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.763
INCENTIVE TO TAKE SOMETHING OUT

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.567
OF USE. WHAT'S THE ISSUE THAT

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:52.236
BINDS THEM IS TOO STRONG A WORD

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:54.605
BUT ALLOWS FOR COMMITMENT THAT

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:55.640
THE STATE GET SOME BENEFITS

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:57.942
EITHER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OR

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.677
WHAT IT IS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:01.612
INCENTIVE AND IT SEEMS TO ME

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:02.547
THAT'S THE BIG MISSING PIECE OF

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:06.217
THIS. AND THEN. THE SO I SORT

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:07.985
OF FEEL NOT UNDERSTANDING

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:09.687
EXACTLY HOW THIS IS MOVING AND

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.389
HOW THIS IS GOING TO END. A

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:13.324
NEED TO SAY THOSE ARE A COUPLE

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:14.992
OF CONCERNS THAT JUST NEED TO

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:16.227
BE ADDRESSED IN WHATEVER THIS

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:17.829
PROCESSES OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:21.799
WEEKS AND THE BREAK AND-

00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:23.868
ETIENNE ON THE CHAIR. YOU

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:25.269
SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:27.238
THE CHAIR EVEN IF THE BILL IS A

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:28.005
YANKED BACK TO COMMITTEE

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:30.074
BECAUSE I THINK. IF THIS BILL

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.477
PASSES OUT TODAY. IT IS ON THE

00:33:32.543 --> 00:33:35.646
FAITH. THAT YOUR COMMITMENT TO

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:37.048
THE CHAIR TO ADDRESS THOSE

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:39.183
ISSUES IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:43.187
THIS BILL TO WORK. AND SO. YOU

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:54.766
KNOW I GUESS GIVEN ALL. THE

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:55.333
COMMITMENTS AND THINGS SO I

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:55.833
WILL QUOTE FOR THIS BILL

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:56.434
BECAUSE I LIKED THE CONCEPT.

00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:57.034
BUT THERE'S JUST MUCH THAT NOT

00:33:57.101 --> 00:33:57.635
WHERE OUT YET NEEDS TO BE OUT

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:58.703
FOR THIS. TO HAVE A RIGHT TO GO

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.371
THE GOVERNOR'S. BESIDE JUDGES

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.774
THOSE WITH THE ISSUES IS. AS I

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.609
CAN. THAT BECAUSE IF THERE HAD

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:07.412
BEEN THE- I WOULD BE ASKING YOU

00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:09.414
TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT. OR

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.249
DEVELOP AN AMENDMENT. TO

00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:12.617
DEVELOP THE PROTECTION ON THE

00:34:12.683 --> 00:34:14.719
OTHER SIDE FOR ANY AFTER AN

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:16.120
INCENTIVE IS GIVEN TO MAKE SURE

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:17.422
THAT IT'S GUARANTEED THAT'S

00:34:17.488 --> 00:34:19.190
WHAT I WAS FOR. HER TO COME

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:21.592
INTO THIS HEARING AND DO TODAY

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.327
SEEMS LIKE. GOT THERE ALREADY

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:26.497
BUT. AND IT JUST MAKES ME

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:30.835
NERVOUS. THAT THIS CLOSE TO THE

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.637
END OF SESSION AND THERE'S SO

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:35.473
MANY OPEN ISSUES AND SO IT IS

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.275
IN THE OTHER HOUSE AND IF IT

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:39.110
TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T RESOLVE A

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:41.345
LOT OF FUN THEN. YOU KNOW WE

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:43.047
HAVE NEXT YEAR TO DO IT BUT BUT

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:45.283
THAT'S JUST WHERE WE ARE RIGHT

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:47.718
NOW. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR

00:34:47.785 --> 00:34:49.220
PUTTING UP WITH ALL OUR STUFF

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:51.956
IS ON. AND THEN IF IT IF IT

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:55.226
HELPS I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.427
AND MAKE THE COMMENTARY SAID

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:58.229
EARLIER IT JUST TO BE CLEAR I

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.530
MEAN THAT THE DEFAULT

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:01.232
SUGGESTION WAS GOING TO BE

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:03.568
ABOUT. THE RETIREMENT OF THAT

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:04.902
LAND PERMANENTLY FROM

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:07.839
GROUNDWATER PUMPING. THE REASON

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:09.841
WE HAD IT OUT A LITTLE NUANCE

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:11.342
AND DIDN'T JUST TRY TO SORT OF.

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:14.045
BLUNTLY ADD THAT IN IS THAT IN

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:16.814
THE CONTEXT OF SIGMA. UNDER SAY

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.549
A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:21.185
PLAN IT SUBMITTED IN THEORY- A

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:22.920
DECADE FROM NOW AFTER AFTER AN

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.188
INCENTIVE WAS GIVEN TO A

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:26.257
PARTICULAR LANDOWNER. AND A

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:28.426
DECADE OR EVEN TWO FROM NOW

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:29.994
UNDER A UNDER GROUNDWATER

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:31.362
SUSTAINABILITY PLANS IN THAT

00:35:31.429 --> 00:35:34.365
AREA IT MAY BE THAT. OTHER LAND

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:36.033
IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR TAKING

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.702
OUT OF USE AND THAT LAND IS

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.270
ACTUALLY RESTORED AND THE

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:41.606
AQUIFER ITSELF IS IN CONDITION

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.541
WHERE. THEY MAY HAVE YOU KNOW

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.376
AN ALLOCATION THAT MAKES SENSE

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:47.712
SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE. OVERLY

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.380
RESTRICTIVE BUT YOUR POINT

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:50.781
ABOUT THE PROPORTIONALITY OF

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.583
THE BENEFITS AND THE DURABILITY

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.951
AND TIMING WAS REALLY ESSENTIAL

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:55.786
SO I THINK THAT DEFAULT ISN'T

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:57.922
IT JUST AN OUTRIGHT-

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.624
RETIREMENT- RESTRICTION BUT I

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.692
THINK WE- WE WANTED TO ADD THAT

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:03.861
NEW ONES IN THERE BECAUSE- IT

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:05.029
WE STILL MAY BE ABLE TO. BE

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:06.931
ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS OF

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.766
THESE INCENTIVES WITHOUT A

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:11.802
FOREVER. RETIREMENT SO JUST

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:15.206
IGNORE IT IF I MY SISTER ARE

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:17.608
COMMON I THINK THAT'S GREAT. I

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.644
APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND I

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.511
THINK THAT'S KIND OF

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:21.846
FLEXIBILITY AGAINST THE

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:24.148
ULTIMATE GOAL. OF THAT IS

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:25.883
NEEDED AND I'M WAS NOT IN THE

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.218
LEGISLATURE WHEN THIS WAS

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:29.086
ADOPTED BUT I ONCE. IN A

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:30.788
POSITION WHERE I WAS INVOLVED

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:34.258
IN IT IN THE ONE THING FOR ME

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:35.993
AND IT AND IT WAS MY INDIVIDUAL

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.697
VIEW. OF IT IN THE END THE

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.132
DATES WERE PUSHED OUT TO GET

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:43.000
THE LAST VOTES I THINK COURT TO

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:46.103
PROTECT THE LAST VOTED FOR ME.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.205
THE CRISIS IS SO PROFOUND I

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:53.010
THOUGHT. THE DATE NEEDED TO BE

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.178
CLOSER. AND ANDREA THE

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:55.046
AGREEMENT WAS MADE TO PASS THE

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:57.982

00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.750
CONSEQUENCE OF THE THING THAT I

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.986
DIDN'T WANT IS IT THERE MIGHT

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:04.789
BE TIME TO WORK THIS OUT IT IN

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:07.925

A. R. B. TO WORK WITH.

00:55:55.985 --> 00:55:58.321
STAKEHOLDERS WITH PARTNERS. TO

00:55:58.388 --> 00:56:00.890
DEVELOP STANDARDS AND METHODS

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:03.326
FOR STATE AGENCIES TO TRACK.

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:05.562
THESE GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS-

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:07.630
AND INDIA CERTAINLY WHETHER

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:10.100
IT'S RELATED YOU KNOW THE

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:13.336
SEQUESTRATION- SO YOU WOULD

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.905
DEPEND ON THE A. R. B. TO BE

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:17.507
THE ONE TO DEVELOP THE WAYS TO

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:19.008
MEASURE THE SIZZLE THE NOT

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.443
NECESSARILY ARE BASICALLY THE

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:21.711
COORDINATING AGENCY IN THIS

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:23.113
EFFORT- BUT CERTAINLY IT'S

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:24.848
LOOKING TO. OTHER STATE

00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:25.815
AGENCIES TO THE RELEVANT STATE

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:28.218
AGENCIES- THAT WORK IN THIS

00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:29.519
SPACE ARE BRINGING THESE

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:31.688
EXPERTS ARE IN THE SAME ROOM

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:33.022
AND HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS IS

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.324
CERTAINLY REACHING A POINT

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.027
WHERE. WE HAVE THESE MEASURABLE

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:40.196
GOALS IN PLACE. OKAY THE I JUST

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:42.098
FOUND THAT. THE RBA DIDN'T

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:43.233
ALWAYS LISTEN TO THE OTHER

00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:45.401
PEOPLE IN THOSE ROOMS WHEN THAT

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:50.206
HAPPENED- BUT- BUT WHAT LET ME-

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:52.575
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE- I WAS

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.544
AROUND MAYBE WAIT TILL YOU'RE

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:56.279
CLOSE BUT LET ME ASK ABOUT SOME

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:58.615
OF THE AGRICULTURAL CONCERNS

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:00.650
BECAUSE IN THE- IN THE PACKET

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.519
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:03.753
THIS WOULDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.622
THE IMPACT FROM DROUGHTS.

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:07.457
WHETHER MARKETS ARE PASSED AND-

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:09.025
IF FOR EXAMPLE THE LAND

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:11.060
CONSERVATION TO PROTECT I

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:11.661
GLANCE IS ONE OF THE

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:13.863
STRATEGIES. THAT DOESN'T

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.166
NECESSARILY GET INTERRUPTED BY

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:18.268
DROUGHT WEATHER MARKETER PASS

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:20.103
THEN ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.404
THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THIS WAS

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:23.973
AN ADMISSIONS EMISSIONS CAP ON

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:27.610
THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. THE

00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:28.378
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:30.246
HEARD THAT. HOW WOULD YOU

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:34.184
RESPOND TO THAT IN TERMS OF. OF

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.385
WANTING TO MOVE AHEAD WITH YOUR

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:38.855
BILL WHY IS THAT TRUE OR NOT

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:40.557
TRUE FOR YOU. WELL YOU KNOW THE

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:41.825
BILL DOESN'T SPECIFY THAT WE

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:43.426
INTEND TO IMPOSE EMISSION CAPS

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:45.562
ON ON ON AGRICULTURE IT'S NOT

00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:47.297
MY INTENT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:50.200
APPRECIATE- THE STATEMENTS-

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:51.768
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. OR THAT

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:53.937
WERE MADE BY OPPOSITION WHO'VE

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:54.604
BEEN WORKING WITH THEM EVERY

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:56.573
STEP O THE WAY- AND YOU KNOW

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:58.041
CERTAINLY I THINK. WHEN YOU

00:57:58.107 --> 00:58:00.977
LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS- AND-

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:02.011
THEIR CONCERNS ONE OF THE

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:03.079
STATEMENTS THAT I AGREE WITH

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:05.982
THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW- ME

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.783
AROUND NATIONAL WORKING LANDS

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.319
THAT. THEY DO NOT HAVE A

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:10.520
FINANCIAL RETURN BUT RATHER

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:12.055
REQUIRE A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:12.989
BY THE LANDOWNER WOULD TRY TO

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:14.324
CHANGE THAT EXACTLY WHY WE'RE

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:16.793
DOING THIS. IS TO GENERATE- YOU

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.661
KNOW- USE BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:22.131
AND TO IDENTIFY- OPTIONS

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:24.067
POTENTIAL INCENTIVES SOME-

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:26.669
SOME- SOME REQUIRED- SOME

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:28.605
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT TO DO

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:32.508
WHAT WE CAN. TO ADDRESS THIS

00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:34.777
EMERGING CLIMATE CRISIS- YOU

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:38.114
KNOW THERE'S A HE WE CAN'T TALK

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:38.882
ABOUT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW-

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:41.551
REGIONAL CLIMATE GOALS ABOUT.

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:44.287
ONE DAY BEING- CARBON NEUTRAL

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:47.090
OR- WE ARE WITHOUT NATURAL

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:48.258
WORKING LANDS IN A PART OF THAT

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:49.792
SOLUTION AND SO IT'S DOING OUR

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:51.861
PART TO LEVERAGE EVERY POSSIBLE

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:54.564
OPTION WE HAVE. TO INSURE THAT

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:57.467
WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN. TO

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.435
YOU KNOW. RIGHT A DIFFERENT

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:00.470
NARRATIVE AROUND THIS CLIMATE

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:02.772
CRISIS IT REALLY IS- YOU KNOW I

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.008
ENCOURAGE I'D BUY. APPRECIATE

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:07.277
THEIR COMMENTS BUT CERTAINLY

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:09.445
MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. TO

00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:11.648
FOSTER A COLLABORATIVE WORKING

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.715
RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.183
STAKEHOLDERS AND IN THIS CASE

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:16.052
IS AGRICULTURE- THAT WE ALL

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:18.221
NEED TO DO MORE. TO SHORTEN

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:20.890
THAT- WHERE- YOU KNOW THAT WE

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:22.792
ENSURE THAT AGRICULTURE REMAINS

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:23.993
PRODUCTIVE. THAT'S FULL IN THE

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.728
STATE. BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:26.763
HAPPEN IN THE CURRENT TRACK

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:31.200
THAT WE ARE ON. I. THINK YOU

00:59:31.267 --> 00:59:32.969
KNOW. OR ARE WE IN THE LEAD.

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:34.704
KNOWS ONE OF THE- WE CO AUTHORS

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:36.673
OF A B. THIRTY TWO AND THE

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.708
GENIUS OF HOW THAT BILL WAS

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:41.444
NEGOTIATED. IS THAT IT GAVE

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:44.047
AUTHORITY TO THE AIR RESOURCES

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:46.549
BOARD AND IT GAVE MONEY OR THE

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.351
ABILITY TO RAISE MONEY TO THE

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.553
AIR RESOURCES BOARD. BUT IT

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.689
DIDN'T LITIGATE EACH INDIVIDUAL

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:55.558
ITEM IN THE BILL SO IT WAS

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:58.294
DECIDED THAT. IT WOULD BE IN

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.330
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR OR

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.298
DIFFERENT THINGS IT WOULD BE

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:02.865
WITHIN THE AUTHORITY OF THE

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.702
MONEY. AND THEY ARE BASED TO DO

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:08.104
IT. R. AND THAT WAY WE COULD

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:10.840
pPUT THE DEADLINES IN THE

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.308
FORTIES AND THE MONEY IN IT

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.843
RATHER THAN LITIGATE FORTY TWO

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.378
INDIVIDUAL ISSUES THAT WOULD

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.413
HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD. AND SO

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.416
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:20.984
STRUCTURE IS VERY SIMILAR.

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.251
BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO SET

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:24.721
THE GOAL AND- EVEN THOUGH

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:25.855
THEY'RE STILL I THINK SOME

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:29.525
CONCERNS ABOUT MEASURING IT-

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.761
AND YET THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.629
GIVE SOME ASSURANCE TO THE AG

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:36.366
INDUSTRY THAT STRUCTURE THAT

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:37.700
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:40.703
FOR THEM. AND WITH IN SETTING

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.905
THE GOAL AND WITH AN

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:46.109
EMPOWERING- AGENCIES OR PEOPLE

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.910
TO MEET THE GOAL SEEMS TO ME

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:48.611
THAT THAT YOUR POLITICAL

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.814
CHALLENGE HERE IT IS YES BAG

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:55.184
HAS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.420
BY- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:00.023
NATURAL CONCERN THAT. THAT JUST

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.057
THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN THAT

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:03.192
GET IN THE WAY OF THEIR OWN

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:06.195
BUSINESS AND SO. I SUPPORT THIS

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:08.398
BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE THIS AND

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:09.999
I THINK THAT WE STILL NEED TO

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.701
DECIDE SOME OF THE STRATEGIES

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:12.802
AND SOME OF THE MEASUREMENTS

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.837
BUT- I THINK THE CHALLENGES IS

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:16.339
MAKING SURE AGRICULTURE

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:17.807
UNDERSTANDS THERE'S A WAY THEY

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.075
CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:20.510
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:23.446
TO THEM SO. IN ANY EVENT SORRY

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.181
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT ABOUT-

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.749
I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:29.986
HOPE YOU JUST CONTINUE TO WORK

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:30.620
ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES WE WILL

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:31.788
DO WHAT WE CAN. VERY GOOD THANK

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.356
YOU FOR THE INSIGHT. CENTER

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:35.625
LAYERED ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.527
MAKE A QUICK COMMENT- SHE YOU

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:39.729
WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:42.131
THIS MEASURE AND FOR YOUR-

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:43.933
DOGGEDNESS ON THIS ISSUE.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.335
SESSION AFTER SESSION- NOT

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.271
GIVING UP ON TRYING TO UP LIT.

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.839
NATURAL WORKING LANDS WE SPEND

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:50.506
MOST THE DISCUSSION ON

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.075
AGRICULTURE ISSUES. BUT I THINK

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.709
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THIS THE

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.278
BILLS EVEN BROADER THAN THAT

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:56.679
WE'RE LOOKING AT. ALL THE

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.282
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CARBON SINKS-

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:00.316
IN CALIFORNIA AND LIMITING

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:03.753
SOURCES- IN OUR FORESTS- IN

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.689
OTHER HABITATS IN OTHER.

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:07.590
REGIONS AND WHAT I WOULD JUST

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.293
SAY IS. TO SETTLERS POINT. I

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:11.360
THINK IT'S SMART ABOUT THIS

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:13.329
FRAMEWORK IS YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.164
NOT PLUCKING AN ARBITRARY GOAL

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.266
OUT. JUST FOR THIS SECTOR.

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.068
YOU'RE GIVING DISCRETION ON

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.104
THOSE TARGETS AND EXACTLY WHAT

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.905
GOALS WERE GONNA SET. WITHIN

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:25.241
NATURAL WORKING LANDS. AND SOME

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:27.143
OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT. THAT

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.644
BEING ADDED FOR INSTANCE

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:30.913
MENTIONED THINGS LIKE-

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.983
BIODIVERSITY SO YOU'RE NOT JUST.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:37.053
HUNTING FOR CARBON BLINDLY- AND

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.254
THEN YOU'RE STILL AWARE OF SORT

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:40.656
OF OTHER OTHER GOALS IN MIND-

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:41.958
YOUR YOU WERE STILL STAYING

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:44.060
AWARE OF- THE PURPOSES OF THESE

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:45.895
LANDS TO GROW FOOD. SO IT'S NOT

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:49.132
JUST A SORT OF A BLIND MISSION

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:51.801
ON CARBON- OVER EVERYTHING ELSE

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:53.136
BUT IT'S INTEGRATED WITHIN THAT

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.670
BROADER CONTEXT WHICH I HOPE

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.239
RING SOME COMFORT AND A SENSE

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:57.573
OF BALANCE ALTHOUGH I REALIZE.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.041
A LOT OF THIS WILL SHAKE OUT

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:01.010
THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND- I

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.245
FRANKLY THINK IT'S TOO MUCH FOR

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.513
US TO TRY TO SOLVE ALL THAT

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:05.047
HERE ALSO WHICH IS GOING TO ADD

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.649
ONE MORE POINT WHICH IS TO THE

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:07.717
TO THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:08.651
MEASUREMENT I THINK SOME OF

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.086
THOSE AMENDMENTS. WE ADDED

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:12.655
BRINGING IN CDFA AND C. N. R.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.524

INTO THE CONSULTATION PROCESS

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.360
AND HAVING THEM BRING THAT

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.128
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE SO IT'S NOT

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:20.763
JUST AIRBOARD MATH. BUT IT'S

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.466
REALLY BEING DRIVEN BY CDFA AND

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:26.135
SCENERY HOPEFULLY WILL ADD-

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:29.605
SOME MORE- FIRMNESS TO

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:31.107

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:32.108
THIS IS THE YEAR TO GET IT DONE

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:33.676
AND I THINK IT IT TRULY MAKES

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:34.944
SENSE. IN A MUCH BROADER

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:36.812

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:38.814

THE WITNESS SAID- THIS WAS ONLY

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.195
A CORRECTION. BUT IT'S A

01:16:07.262 --> 01:16:09.264
MONUMENTAL CORRECTION BECAUSE

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:11.967
OF THE- RE DRESSES ARE AMAZING

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:16.471
GRIEVANCE. IN OUR HISTORY- AND

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.407
BECAUSE OF- LAND THAT WAS

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:20.442
REMOVED AND BEING ABLE TO

RETURN. TO OUR LAND AT SEA

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.279
OPTION BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:25.881
THAT IT MIGHT BE A APPEAR TO BE

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.116
A MINOR CORRECTION. IT GOES TO

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:30.285
A SOVEREIGN NATION. ARE NONE OF

THE OTHER GRANTS GO TO

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:33.121
SOVEREIGN NATIONS AND SO THAT

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:35.590
SETS UP. A COMPLETELY

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:39.294
DIFFERENT. SITUATION FOR. THE

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.229
TRANSFER AND THE ULTIMATE

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:44.099
MANAGEMENT AND- A WHAT I'M NOT

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:45.867
SURE ABOUT ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:49.237
THAT WERE JUST. MENTIONED IS

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:53.108
THAT IN- WHEN LAND IS ACQUIRED.

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:55.377
BY THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.346
BOARD RATHER SHORT OR MAKE A

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:59.081
GRANT TO ACQUIRE TRANSFER

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:01.450
LANGUAGE. IT IS ALWAYS FOR

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:03.352
STATE PURPOSES IN THE STATE

01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:06.154
PURPOSE IS THAT. IT BE FOR

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.556
EXAMPLE A WETLANDS WITH NO

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:10.792
DEVELOPMENT. AND YET IT MIGHT

01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:13.328
NOT NECESSARILY HAVE A FULL

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:15.364
FLEDGED CONSERVATION EASEMENT

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:18.000
ON IT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:20.302
ACQUIRED FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:22.938
SO TO ME. WHAT THE AMENDMENTS

01:17:23.005 --> 01:17:26.408
APPEAR TO DO ONE. IS THEY DO

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.943
THEIR BEST TO PROTECT MOST

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.478
SITUATIONS BUT THEY DO THEIR

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:31.279
BEST TO PROTECT WHERE THERE'S

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:32.948
ALREADY AN EASEMENT BERARDI

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:34.549
SOMETHING THERE AND YET IT

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:35.684
MIGHT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WITH

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:37.419
THAT INFERENCE BUT THOUGHT.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:44.693
THERE THEN SO IT IT SEEMS THAT.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.293
THE BEST PROTECTION WOULD BE.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.995
TO GUARANTEE THE TRAIN LINE.

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:50.499
THAT AIR MISTER COLLAGEN OUR

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:52.267

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.136
CONSISTENT WITH HIS COMMENTS.

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:56.271
THAT IF THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:58.573
PUTTING AN EASEMENT ON. FOR A

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.175
REVERSION OR OTHER THINGS TO

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:01.576
TEND TO BE PART OF THE TRANSFER

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.478
LANGUAGE AND THAT WAY YOU DON'T

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.580
RELY ON WHETHER THERE'S AN EVEN

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.516
APPLICATION OF WHETHER THERE

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:08.917
ARE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS THAT

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:10.619
HAVE BEEN GIVEN. YOU'RE GETTING

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:12.254
THE PROTECTION IN THE LANGUAGE

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.756
IN THE TRANSFER IT AND SO FOR

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.992
ME. THAT WOULD BE THE IMPORTANT

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:18.693
THING TO HAVE IT IN THE

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.830
AMENDMENTS IS THAT WE JUST KNOW

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:23.832
THAT EVERY PARCEL THAT IS

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:26.034
TRANSFERRED IS GOING TO BE

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.270
CLEAR TO THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:30.572
IT WAS DESIGNATED REQUIRED AND

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:34.342
THAT WAY. EVEN THOUGH- MAYBE

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:34.943
THE REST OF THESE AMENDMENTS

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.212
ARE FINE. YOU YOU'RE NOT

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:38.513
GETTING INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.615
TRUST OR SOVEREIGNTY ATION

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:41.650
YOU'RE TRANSFERRING THE LANDS

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:43.218
WITH REQUIREMENTS ON IT THAT

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:44.820
WERE RELATED TO THE RECENT THAT

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.188
THE LAND WAS ACQUIRED IN THE

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:48.190
FIRST PLACE. AND IT SEEMS TO ME

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:50.725
THAT WOULD BE. THE BEST WAY TO

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:53.628
PROTECT AGAINST ANYTHING HERE

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:54.696
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:56.431
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MR KHAN

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:57.699
SAID YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE

01:18:57.766 --> 01:19:00.001
AMENDMENT UP FRONT. AND YOU DO

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.104
THAT AND SO FOR ME THAT'S WHAT

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:05.307
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND THEN

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:06.141
YOU KNOW I'M COMFORTABLE

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.076
BECAUSE- TO BE HONEST AND IT

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.744
MIGHT BE A DICEY COMMENT TO

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:13.949
MAKE IT PUBLIC. THERE WAS A

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.750
SIMILAR. OUR THING DONE WITH

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:18.086
THE PUBLIC. COMMISSION AND P.

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:20.989
JEANNIE LANCE. AND IT BASICALLY

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:23.158
GIVES A FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL.

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:24.659
TO TRIBES AND IT GOT IN THE

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:27.262
MIDDLE OF SOME PROCESSES THAT

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:30.765
WERE ALREADY ADVANCED. AND IN A

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:35.003
WAY THAT. YOU WANT TO PROTECT

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.471
AGAINST DEVELOPMENT ON THOSE

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:37.739
PARCELS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:40.809
P. GENIE LAMP YOU WANT TO HONOR

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:42.844
THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES THE

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:44.779
SACRED SITES IN THE HISTORIC

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:47.582
SITES AND ALLOW FOR MANAGEMENT

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:48.650
AND THOSE THINGS BROUGHT UP

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:50.085
AGAINST EACH OTHER AND WE HAVE

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:53.588
THE SAME PRINCIPLE HERE SO. A

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.891
HIGH WOULD SUPPORT. AN

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:57.759
AMENDMENT THAT'S THAT'S

01:19:57.826 --> 01:19:59.561
INVOLVED IN THE TRANSFER AND

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.629
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.097
ABOUT THE SOVEREIGN NATION OR

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:03.198
THE TRUST YOU'RE JUST PUTTING

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.267
IT ON THE LAND AS SHE

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.801
TRANSFERRED AS A CONDITION SO.

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:07.936
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS IN

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.571
THE PROCESS OR WHETHER THAT'S

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.672
SOMETHING WE COULD

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:12.874
REALISTICALLY DO BUT- BUT I

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:14.543
THINK THAT WOULD ADDRESS THIS

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:16.978
ISSUE REALLY STRONG. IN AND MY

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.713
SUGGESTION THERE CERTAINLY ARE

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.850
THE LANGUAGE THAT THAT I READ.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:24.486
THIS IS TO AMEND A B. THREE

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:25.620
SEVEN NINE TO INSURE

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.522
TRANSFERRED CONSERVATION LANDS.

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:31.626
ARE MANAGED FOR THE PURPOSES.

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:32.127
FOR WHICH THE LANDS WERE

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:32.694
TRANSFERRED. AND CONTINUED

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.329
SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE IN

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:35.664
ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE LAWS

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.532
AND REGULATIONS. BUT RATHER

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:38.667
THAN SAYING SURE TRANSFERRED

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:40.402
CONSERVATION LANDS WE COULD

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:42.671
JUST CLARIFY I THINK THAT IT'S

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:46.274
IN THE TRANSFER OF THAT PLANT.

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:48.009
SO IT'S IT COULD BE IN THAT.

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:52.781
THAT THAT WOULD BE- RECOGNIZED

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:54.983
OR PROVIDED FOR IN THE TRANSFER

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.585
ITSELF THAT FEEDER TRUST

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:58.320
TRANSFER AND IT SEEMS THERE'S

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.288
SOME LANGUAGE HERE IT MIGHT

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.657
STILL NEED TO BE TWEAKED A

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:04.359
BECAUSE IT SAYS FOR THE

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:05.527
PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE LAND WAS

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:07.596
TRANSFERRED AND THAT'S RATHER

01:21:07.662 --> 01:21:10.098
OPEN AHA I THINK IT'S FOR THE

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:11.600
PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE LAND WAS

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:15.070
ACQUIRED BEFORE TRANSFERRING

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:16.071
THAT. THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE.

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:19.874
HI R. E. THE CONSULTANT SET OFF

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:21.476
MARKET DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:22.911
PLANT AND I THINK THAT'S

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:25.947
CORRECT IN THE REAL PROBLEM IS

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.482
WE'RE TRYING TO DO BILL THE

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:29.918
REPLACED EVERYTHING HERE AND SO

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:31.753
HOW IN DOING THAT DO WE MAKE

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.955
SURE THERE'S NO INFECTION SO

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:40.395
FAR IN ANY EVENT- THE- WELCOME

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:41.363
ANSWER QUESTION WOULD YOU BE

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:42.464
COMFORTABLE WITH SUCH AN

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:44.499
AMENDMENT THAT SORT OF. TIES

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.968
THIS DOWN IN THE TRANSFER YES I

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:49.304
MEAN I'M AGREEABLE TO LANGUAGE

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:51.640
THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND- IN

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:52.674
TALKING WITH THE CHAIRMAN I

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.242
THINK WE CAN WORK HASH OUT WHAT

01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:56.711
THE EXACT LANGUAGE IS YOU GUYS

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:57.679
ARE JUST KIND OF TALKING ABOUT.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.414
YOU KNOW SHOULD BE ACQUIRED I

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:00.582
THINK WE CAN WORK THAT OUT AND

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:01.683
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE EXACT

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.785
LANGUAGES BUT IN GENERAL WHAT

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:04.619
WE'RE TRYING TO SAY HERE IN THE

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:07.155
INTENT IS. THAT WHATEVER THE

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.690
LAMB WAS ACQUIRED FOR THE

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.258
CONSERVATION PURPOSE AT THAT

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:12.594
WOULD CONTINUE- YOU KNOW AFTER

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.629
THE TRANSFER. IN THE END ANY

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:16.464
RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD. YOU

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.800
KNOW PUT IN PLACE. BY THAT- ANY

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:21.536
APPLICABLE LAWS THAT WOULD BE-

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.004
THAT THAT LAND WOULD BE SUBJECT

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.172
TO WITHSTAND PLACE I THINK

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:27.008
THAT'S THE INTENT AND- I DON'T

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.610
THINK ANYBODY'S WANTING TO. YOU

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:29.878
KNOW MESSED WITH THAT ANYHOW I

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:30.679
THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.547
RESPONSE AMONG CLEAR ON THE

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:33.782
PROCESS BECAUSE WE'RE STILL

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.183
GOING TO REFINE THE AMENDMENTS

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:36.451
AFTER WE MOVE OUT OF THIS

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:38.086
HEARING. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.721
SO I THINK WE THE OTHER WILL

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.656
ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT TODAY WITH

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:44.326
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT- WE CAN.

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:47.662
REFINE THAT PROVISION IN

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:50.265
DRAFTING UP AROUND. ENSURING

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:52.434
THAT IT'S IN THE TRANSFER-

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.035
ITSELF AND THAT IT'S NOT

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:56.004
NECESSARILY JUST THE PURPOSES

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.439
FOR WHICHIT WAS TRANSFERRED

01:22:57.505 --> 01:23:00.742
BUT ALSO- TO AND- WHICH WAS

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:03.478

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:12.320
LIKE A GOOD OUTCOME TO MAKE IT

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:13.922

COMET THE QUESTION IS I READ

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:41.707
THE ANALYSIS IT IT IT DOESN'T

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:45.044
SEEM TO MEASURE THE OUTCOMES OF

02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:46.812
THE AGREEMENTS WHAT WILL THAT

02:04:46.879 --> 02:04:48.147
BE PART OF SOME EXISTING

02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:50.216
MEASURING PROCESS TO DETERMINE

02:04:50.282 --> 02:04:51.984
WHAT ACTUALLY IS DONE OUT OF

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:53.552
THESE AGREEMENTS THAT'S A GOOD

02:04:53.619 --> 02:04:55.054
QUESTION IF I MAY TURN TO THE

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:58.090
WITNESS- FOR THAT- POLICE IN

02:04:58.157 --> 02:05:00.793
THE MIST YES. PLEASE GREAT

THANKS. YES WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:03.896
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONNECT IT

02:05:03.963 --> 02:05:07.266
INTO US BEFORE FIFTY SIX AND-

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:11.704
YOUR BILL TO HELP ESTABLISH A-

02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:12.271
ACTION PLAN WITH MEASURABLE

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:15.708
GOAL. I OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO SAY

02:05:15.774 --> 02:05:18.677
GREAT TO THAT SO. THAT'S GOOD

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:20.045
AND THEN I THINK THE EXISTING

02:05:20.112 --> 02:05:21.280
FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:23.449
BUT IT IS IT SOMETHING WE

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:24.550
SHOULD JUST CHECK OVER THE

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:25.551
BREAK TO IF WE HAVE TO

02:05:25.618 --> 02:05:26.852
INTEGRATE SOMETHING FROM THE

02:05:26.919 --> 02:05:28.487
COMMENT I WAS GOING TO MAKE. I

02:05:28.554 --> 02:05:30.422
REALLY APPRECIATED THE ANALYSIS

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:34.093
FOR POINTING OUT- THAT 57% OF

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:35.261
THE FORCE TO THE LANDS ARE

02:05:35.327 --> 02:05:36.929
UNDER FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:38.731
3% UNDER STATE AND LOCAL IN

02:05:38.797 --> 02:05:41.066
CALIFORNIA. AND IT MADE ME

02:05:41.133 --> 02:05:43.168
CRAZY DURING THE LAST NATIONAL

02:05:43.235 --> 02:05:45.037
MINISTRATION BUT SOMEHOW WE

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:46.972
WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING WHEN.

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:48.841
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY WAS

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:50.843
OF FORCE LAND WAS UNDER FEDERAL

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:53.846
CONTROL. AND THE GOOD NEIGHBOR

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.281
AGREEMENTS HAVE HISTORICALLY

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:57.917
BEEN DESIGNED. ONE ONE SIDE IS

02:05:57.983 --> 02:05:59.752
UP FISCALLY AND THE OTHER IS IT

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:02.288
PROPER TO MOVE IN AND SORT OF

02:06:02.354 --> 02:06:04.189
DO THINGS FOR THE OTHER SIDE

02:06:04.256 --> 02:06:06.492
WHEN THEY CAN'T DO IT AND- AT

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:08.260
THE TIME I THINK. GOVERNOR

02:06:08.327 --> 02:06:10.829
NEWSOM TOOK OFFICE- SOMETHING

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.865
LIKE FORTY FIVE OR FORTY SEVEN

02:06:12.932 --> 02:06:15.634
PERCENT. OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:19.071
MONEY FOR FOREST. MANAGEMENT OR

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:20.973
FUELS MANAGEMENT WANT FEDERAL

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.242
LANDS UNDER THE GOOD NEIGHBOR

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:24.576

02:06:24.643 --> 02:06:26.545
REACHING AN WHERE THEY WORKED A

02:06:26.612 --> 02:06:29.648
STEPPING UP. THEN SO THESE

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:30.950
AGREEMENTS WERE THERE TO DO

02:06:31.016 --> 02:06:32.551

STRUCTURES THERE. AND I THINK

02:06:44.897 --> 02:06:46.131
IT CALLS ATTENTION TO SOMETHING

02:06:46.198 --> 02:06:47.499
THAT I'M NOT SURE THE PUBLIC

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:48.968

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:48.360
ESTABLISHING A TIME SCHEDULE.

02:17:48.426 --> 02:17:50.462
FOR THE ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN.

02:17:50.528 --> 02:17:52.263
I'M CURIOUS TO WHAT THE TIME

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:54.399

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:55.000
NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE A LOOK

MOVE FORWARD. ALL OF THIS

02:18:11.383 --> 02:18:12.817
GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IS

02:18:12.884 --> 02:18:15.020
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND

02:18:15.086 --> 02:18:17.389
REDUNDANT IT THE GSA APPLYING

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:19.257

02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:26.491
MORE MONEY MORE TIME IN IS AN

02:19:26.558 --> 02:19:28.827
UNNECESSARY WASTE. A LOSS OF

02:19:28.893 --> 02:19:31.596
LOCAL CONTROL. AND IT'S GOING

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:33.098

02:19:33.164 --> 02:19:36.301

02:19:49.414 --> 02:19:50.982

IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE

02:20:57.515 --> 02:20:58.817
ARGUMENT IS MADE THAT THE BILL

WHAT I WAS HOPING TO BE AN

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:50.401
ADMINISTRATIVE SOLUTION I THINK

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:50.968
WE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF

02:31:51.035 --> 02:31:53.704

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:58.309
THAT- IN THE PACKET YOU

02:32:01.512 --> 02:32:02.947
EVEN THE STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS

02:32:03.013 --> 02:32:04.849
OUT THAT THERE THERE ARE

02:32:04.915 --> 02:32:07.151
DEADLINES IN LOS- BUT- THERE

02:32:07.218 --> 02:32:09.753
ARE ALSO DISCRETIONARY.

02:32:13.657 --> 02:32:16.460
REQUIRE A DATA BASE TO BE PUT

IN PROBATIONARY STATUS. TO GIVE

02:32:19.163 --> 02:32:21.899
THEM DISCRETION TO- TO GO PAST

02:32:21.966 --> 02:32:23.934
THAT STATUTORY DEADLINE SO YOU

02:32:24.001 --> 02:32:25.135

PLACED ON PROBATIONARY STATUS.

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:29.340
TO MEET THAT DEADLINE I BELIEVE

02:32:29.406 --> 02:32:34.211
THE ANALYSIS STATES- IT'S THAT

02:32:34.278 --> 02:32:35.246
THIS THIS SPECIFICALLY STATE

02:32:35.312 --> 02:32:37.781

02:32:42.052 --> 02:32:43.254
MEDIUM PRIORITY BASIN AS A

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:45.923
PROBATIONARY BASIN IF THE BOARD

02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:48.192

CERTAIN SITUATIONS APPLIED TO

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:52.329
THE BASIN- AND BUT IF THE IF

02:32:52.396 --> 02:32:53.931
THAT BASIN HAS BEEN WORKING IN

02:32:53.998 --> 02:32:58.002
GOOD FAITH- AND PROVIDES A PLAN

02:32:58.068 --> 02:33:00.104
AFTER THE DEADLINE SO YOU ONE

02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.704
HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AS YOU'RE

02:33:00.771 --> 02:33:02.172
PROPOSING NOTHING IN LAW

02:33:02.239 --> 02:33:03.173
REQUIRES THEM TO PUT ON

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:05.476
PROBATIONARY STATUS. TO ACCEPT

02:33:05.543 --> 02:33:07.511
THAT AND THERE'S- THIS IS NOT

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:09.013
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY IS

02:33:09.079 --> 02:33:10.781
BROADCASTED BUT THERE'S

02:33:10.848 --> 02:33:13.717
ACTUALLY NOT A- AND- VIOLATION

02:33:13.784 --> 02:33:15.152
PROVISION IN STATUTE WHERE

02:33:27.631 --> 02:33:30.167
ABOUT SIXTY THREE BASINS WITH

02:33:30.234 --> 02:33:31.235
THEIR PLANS DO IN TWENTY TWENTY

02:33:31.302 --> 02:33:33.837
TWO- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A FEW

02:33:33.904 --> 02:33:36.173
OF THOSE TODAY. ABOUT NINETY

02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:37.975
PLANS ARE ON THEIR WAY AND

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:40.744
AFTER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD VERY

02:33:40.811 --> 02:33:43.113
TENSE IN THIS IS COMPLEX STUFF

02:33:43.180 --> 02:33:45.816
TO LAND- ONE OF THESE PLANS ARE

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:47.585
WITHIN THE BASIN OR MULTIPLE

02:33:47.651 --> 02:33:48.552
PLANS WITHIN THE BASIN UNDER

02:33:48.619 --> 02:33:50.888
SIGMA. AND I RECOGNIZE THE

02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:52.823
TENSION AND- THAT THAT THAT-

02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:55.225
ELEVATES BUT- THE DROUGHT

02:33:55.292 --> 02:33:57.795
NECESSITATES US TO ACTUALLY TRY

02:33:57.861 --> 02:33:59.196
TO GET TO SOME SUSTAINABILITY

02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:00.531
WHICH IS THE ENTIRE DESIGN OF

02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:02.499
SIGMUND THE FIRST PLACE. SO MY

02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:03.667
CONCERN ABOUT THE LEGISLATION

02:34:03.734 --> 02:34:07.271
AT THIS POINT IS THAT IT FOR RE

02:34:07.338 --> 02:34:08.072
OPENING SIGMA. FOR JUST A

02:34:08.138 --> 02:34:11.542
HANDFUL OF MEDIUM BASINS- THAT

02:34:11.609 --> 02:34:13.277
ALREADY HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:34:13.344 --> 02:34:15.946
RECORDS WITH STATE WATER BOARD-

02:34:16.013 --> 02:34:17.448
AND THEN AS THE GREAT

02:34:17.514 --> 02:34:18.315
CALIFORNIA GROUNDWATER

02:34:18.382 --> 02:34:20.851
ASSOCIATION NOTES- THAT THE

02:34:20.918 --> 02:34:21.685

TOWARDS THE EXISTING DEADLINES

02:34:26.490 --> 02:34:28.459
FOR FIVE YEARS. IT'S NOT THE

02:34:28.525 --> 02:34:29.960
TIME TO POSTPONE OR DELAY THIS

02:34:30.027 --> 02:34:32.363

WANT THIS HEARING TO ANYWAY

02:34:52.149 --> 02:34:53.417
BUYS THAT APPLICATION AND I

02:34:53.484 --> 02:34:54.151
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

02:34:54.218 --> 02:34:55.452
IMPLICATION OF BAD FAITH ON

02:34:55.519 --> 02:34:56.754
THEIR PART. I TAKE THEM AT

HUGE CHALLENGES AND WE ALL KNOW

02:34:59.390 --> 02:35:01.325
RURAL BROADBAND'S AN ISSUE AND-

02:35:01.392 --> 02:35:04.161

HARDSHIPS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH

02:35:05.162 --> 02:35:07.164
I JUST I THINK THERE'S WE HAVE

02:35:07.231 --> 02:35:09.166
TO BE. INCREDIBLY CAREFUL

02:35:09.233 --> 02:35:11.735
ABOUT. RE OPENING SIGNAL WHEN

02:35:11.802 --> 02:35:13.237
YOU ENTER THIS BILL DOES NOT

02:35:13.303 --> 02:35:14.838
REOPEN SIGMA I UNDERSTOOD

02:35:14.905 --> 02:35:17.841

UNDERSTOOD. OUR MAN. DIRECTOR

02:35:26.517 --> 02:35:28.352
YOU TOO COLD. TO GRANT THE

02:35:28.419 --> 02:35:30.454
EXTENSION VERSUS DOING

02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:32.823
PROBATION. UNDERSTOOD THAT

02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:34.825
THERE'S NOT A CODE SECTION.

02:35:34.892 --> 02:35:36.593
THAT SAYS THEY WON'T PUT THEM

02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:38.395
IN PROBATION IT IS IT'S ALL UP

02:35:38.462 --> 02:35:40.164
IN THE AIR. SO WHY WOULD WE NOT

02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:42.132
DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE RIGHT LIKE

02:35:42.199 --> 02:35:45.102

02:35:45.169 --> 02:35:45.669

A LEGISLATIVE BODY ARE. RIGHT

02:35:55.212 --> 02:35:56.580
BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS WEREALLY

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:58.615
EVEN IN THE AIR SENATOR. SEE

02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:00.551
THAT- THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

02:36:00.617 --> 02:36:01.685
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE NOT

02:36:01.752 --> 02:36:04.088

NOT CHANGED. THE SCOPING PLAN

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:11.028
DEADLINES HAVE NOT CHANGED I

02:36:11.095 --> 02:36:11.795

DEADLINE IF THEY'RE WORKING IN

02:36:22.005 --> 02:36:23.507
GOOD FAITH AND I WOULD HIGHLY

02:36:23.574 --> 02:36:25.042
ENCOURAGE THEM TO KEEP DOING SO

02:36:25.109 --> 02:36:26.443
AND HAVING THAT OPEN DIALOGUE

02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:28.645

COMPLETELY RESPECT YOUR YOUR

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:45.162
POINT OF VIEW BUT- THAT'S JUST

02:36:45.229 --> 02:36:46.597
WHERE I'M- GONNA BE AT TODAY

02:36:46.663 --> 02:36:49.233

A BRIEF COMMENT AND THAT IS

02:37:41.051 --> 02:37:46.490
THAT- IF THE- I AGREE WITH THE

02:37:46.557 --> 02:37:48.225
CHAIR THAT THERE ARE REMEDIES

02:37:48.292 --> 02:37:50.160
DID EXIST WITHOUT DOING THIS

02:37:50.227 --> 02:37:54.298
BILL THE THING THAT I SAID IN A

02:37:54.364 --> 02:37:55.399
PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH THE

02:37:55.465 --> 02:37:57.701
AUTHOR GIVEN ANOTHER BILL I'M

02:37:57.768 --> 02:38:01.705
DOING WITH SIMILAR DEADLINES IS

02:38:01.772 --> 02:38:04.007
IN THAT BILL I'M NOT MOVING THE

02:38:04.074 --> 02:38:06.009
DEADLINES I AM OVER ONLY

02:38:06.076 --> 02:38:07.878
DEALING WITH THE ENFORCEMENT

02:38:07.945 --> 02:38:10.047
THAT EXISTS FOR A BRIEF PERIOD

02:38:10.113 --> 02:38:10.914
DUE TO SOME OF THE SIMILAR

02:38:10.981 --> 02:38:13.584
FACTORS THAT AND THAT THAT

02:38:13.650 --> 02:38:14.818
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ROUTE TO GO

02:38:14.885 --> 02:38:19.690
HERE. BECAUSE I THINK- MR

02:38:19.756 --> 02:38:23.794
DICKINSON- NAILED IT IN HIS-

02:38:23.861 --> 02:38:26.163
TESTIMONIES THERE'S BEEN SEVEN

02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:27.998
YEARS UP TO THIS FOR FIVE YEARS

02:38:28.065 --> 02:38:30.767
AND IT DEPENDING ON THE STATUS

02:38:30.834 --> 02:38:34.605
OF THE BASE AND- HE PIANO WE

02:38:34.671 --> 02:38:37.941
JUST NEED TO AS I SAID IN AN

02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:40.711
EARLIER BLL TODAY- I THOUGHT

02:38:40.777 --> 02:38:42.579
THE COMPROMISES THAT WERE MADE

02:38:42.646 --> 02:38:44.715
IN SEGMENT THE TIME MOVED IT

02:38:44.781 --> 02:38:45.816
OUT FARTHER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE

02:38:45.883 --> 02:38:48.752
BEEN. IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH

02:38:48.819 --> 02:38:51.221
THAT SO IF THE MOTION IS MADE I

02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:52.556
WILL VOTE NO I WOULD HAVE

02:38:52.623 --> 02:38:53.757
PREFERRED THAT OTHER

02:38:53.824 --> 02:38:54.625
ALTERNATIVE I DON'T THINK

02:38:54.691 --> 02:38:58.161
THERE'S- A NEED TO MOVE THE

02:38:58.228 --> 02:39:01.632
DEADLINES OF SEGMENT SELF. SO I

02:39:01.698 --> 02:39:03.300
GUESS I'LL DEFER TO THE AUTHOR

02:39:03.367 --> 02:39:04.601
WHETHER YOU DO IT THERE'S A

02:39:04.668 --> 02:39:06.536
WILLINGNESS TO MAKE A MOTION I

02:39:06.603 --> 02:39:07.571
THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF

02:39:07.638 --> 02:39:08.572
THE COMMITTEE AT LEAST NOT THE

02:39:08.639 --> 02:39:10.040
ENTIRE COMMITTEE BUT- LEAVES

02:39:10.107 --> 02:39:11.975
YOUR DISCRETION MR CHAIRMAN AS

02:39:12.042 --> 02:39:13.810
I TOLD YOU PREVIOUSLY I WAS.

02:39:13.877 --> 02:39:15.812
COMPLETELY HAPPY AND OPEN TO

02:39:15.879 --> 02:39:17.347
MAKING ANY ME ANY AMENDMENTS

02:39:17.414 --> 02:39:20.284
NECESSARY. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD

02:39:20.350 --> 02:39:22.386
IF THE ROUTE AS CENTER LAYERED

02:39:22.452 --> 02:39:24.388
SAID WAS TO CHANGE IT TO A

02:39:24.454 --> 02:39:25.889
DIFFERENT PART OF THAT I'M

02:39:25.956 --> 02:39:28.058
ALWAYS OPEN TO THAT. AS I

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:31.528
STATED IN MY TESTIMONY WE'VE

02:39:31.595 --> 02:39:32.062
AMENDED THIS BILL MULTIPLE

02:39:32.129 --> 02:39:33.830
TIMES. AND IF THE BILL IS

02:39:33.897 --> 02:39:35.332
UNABLE TO GET OUT TODAY I WOULD

02:39:35.399 --> 02:39:36.700
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:39:36.767 --> 02:39:37.567
RECONSIDERATION SO WE CAN

02:39:37.634 --> 02:39:39.536
ACTUALLY LOOK. AT A DIFFERENT

02:39:39.603 --> 02:39:41.672
ROUTE OF AMENDMENTS. MY NUMBER

02:39:41.738 --> 02:39:43.540
ONE THING IS THAT THESE RURAL

02:39:43.607 --> 02:39:45.575
COMMUNITIES. THAT DON'T HAVE

02:39:45.642 --> 02:39:46.877
ACCESS TO INTERNET THAT HAVE

02:39:46.944 --> 02:39:49.179
BEEN HIT BY COVE IT DO NOT

02:39:49.246 --> 02:39:50.981
DESERVE TO GET PUNISHED.

02:39:51.048 --> 02:39:52.015
BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT WERE

02:39:52.082 --> 02:39:53.784
COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR CONTROL

02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:56.586
THAT IS MY GOAL HERE. IT'S NOT

02:39:56.653 --> 02:39:58.622
TO GIVE MORE MORE EXTENSIONS

02:39:58.689 --> 02:39:59.923
AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS AND

02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:01.258
MAKE AN UNFAIR OR ANYTHING LIKE

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:03.060
THAT. WHAT'S UNFAIR IS THAT

02:40:03.126 --> 02:40:05.028
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS. THAT

02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:06.463
THEY'VE BEEN HIT HARDER THAN

02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:09.633
ANY OTHER AREAS THAT ARE NOT

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:11.001
RECEIVING THE SAME RESOURCES.

02:40:11.068 --> 02:40:13.704
SO IT'S MY GOAL THAT THIS BODY.

02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:16.239
REALIZES THAT IN GIVES THEM THE

02:40:16.306 --> 02:40:18.308
HELP. THEY NEED WE'VE WRITTEN

02:40:18.375 --> 02:40:20.510
THIS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY

02:40:20.577 --> 02:40:23.180
HAVE TO PROVE. THAT THEY'RE

02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:25.282
WORTHY OF IT AND THAT THEY ARE

02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:27.351
GOOD ACTORS IN THE DISCRETION

02:40:27.417 --> 02:40:29.786
IS STILL OPEN TO THE DEPARTMENT

02:40:29.853 --> 02:40:30.620
THAT'S CURRENT LAW ALREADY

02:40:30.687 --> 02:40:32.856
STATES. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

02:40:32.923 --> 02:40:33.623
THAT THEY ARE GOING INTO A

02:40:33.690 --> 02:40:36.259
PROBATION APPROVED WE SHOULDN'T

STEPS. IN RESILIENCY AND

02:56:31.914 --> 02:56:34.583
ADAPTATION AND IT'S INTERESTING

02:56:34.650 --> 02:56:37.019
BECAUSE THIS BILL. REALLY

02:56:37.086 --> 02:56:38.654
DECIDES AT THE OFFICE OF

PLANNING AND RESEARCH AS IT DID

02:56:40.256 --> 02:56:41.958

CHAIR NOTED MANY DIFFERENT

02:56:53.235 --> 02:56:54.704
AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING

02:56:54.770 --> 02:56:56.605
DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT I MEAN.

02:56:56.672 --> 02:56:59.308
WE SUPERVISED THE FORCE CLIMATE

02:56:59.375 --> 02:57:00.910
ASSESSMENT AND THE SAFEGUARDING

02:57:00.977 --> 02:57:02.445
PLANNED SAFEGUARDING PLAN IS

02:57:02.511 --> 02:57:03.913
REFERENCED HERE. BUT MY

02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:05.681
QUESTION IS NORMALLY THE

02:57:05.748 --> 02:57:08.351
ANALYSIS WAS RELATED BILLS THAT

02:57:08.417 --> 02:57:10.686
ARE MOVING OR MOVED IN AND THAT

02:57:10.753 --> 02:57:12.355
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE. BEEN

02:57:12.421 --> 02:57:14.223
INCLUDED IN THIS AND THE PRO

02:57:14.290 --> 02:57:17.293
TEM HAS A BILL. SENATE BILL ONE

02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:19.495
THAT ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATES

02:57:19.562 --> 02:57:21.831
REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES OR OR

02:57:21.897 --> 02:57:23.499
SOME KIND OF REGIONAL EFFORT

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:25.134
WITH REGARD TO SEA LEVEL RISE

02:57:25.201 --> 02:57:26.469
AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE

02:57:26.535 --> 02:57:28.838
PARALLEL HERE. ARE YOUR DOING

02:57:28.904 --> 02:57:30.006
COLLABORATIVE'S ALL OVER THE

02:57:30.072 --> 02:57:32.308
STATE WITH REGARD TO RESILIENCY

02:57:32.375 --> 02:57:34.744
AND HER BILL WAS DOING IT- WITH

02:57:34.810 --> 02:57:36.779
REGARD TO SEA LEVEL RISE AND I

02:57:36.846 --> 02:57:38.647
WONDERED IF YOU. JUST COMMIT

02:57:38.714 --> 02:57:42.251
OVER THE BREAK TO WORK TO MAKE

02:57:42.318 --> 02:57:43.619
SURE THAT SOMEHOW. THOSE FIFTY.

02:57:43.686 --> 02:57:45.054
BECAUSE BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T BE

02:57:45.121 --> 02:57:46.088
JUST MOVING AHEAD WITH TWO

02:57:46.155 --> 02:57:48.557
DIFFERENT. STRUCTURES ABOUT A

02:57:48.624 --> 02:57:50.793
PIECE OF THE SAME ISSUE.

02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:53.729
ABSOLUTELY SENATOR- AND TOTALLY

02:57:53.796 --> 02:57:55.264
COMMITTED TO DOING THAT- WE

02:57:55.331 --> 02:57:56.032
THINK THIS BILL IS

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:59.702
COMPLEMENTARY TO S. B. Y. AND-

02:57:59.769 --> 02:58:01.704
AS IT WILL PROVIDE A STATE-

02:58:01.771 --> 02:58:02.605
GUIDANCE FOR THE REGIONAL

02:58:02.671 --> 02:58:04.173
ADAPTATION PLANNING ISSUE ONCE

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:05.508
FOCUSING ON PROVIDING THE

02:58:05.574 --> 02:58:06.475
RESOURCES TO ASSIST LOCAL

02:58:06.542 --> 02:58:09.278
GOVERNMENTS. IN THAT REGARD- IN

02:58:09.345 --> 02:58:10.379
THE RESPONSE TO C. LEVEL RISE

02:58:10.446 --> 02:58:11.414
BUT I SEE IT IS IT AS

02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:13.049
COMPLEMENTARY BUT IF THERE ARE

02:58:13.115 --> 02:58:14.784
IF THERE IF IT IS COMPLEMENTARY

02:58:14.850 --> 02:58:17.153
EXCUSE ME. MISTER CHAIR IT IS

02:58:17.219 --> 02:58:18.954
COMPLEMENTARY BUT IT DOES SET

02:58:19.021 --> 02:58:20.823
UP TWO STRUCTURES THAT ARE

02:58:20.890 --> 02:58:23.426
SOMEWHAT COMPETING AND IT SEEMS

02:58:23.492 --> 02:58:24.693
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE IF

02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:25.961
IT'S FIGURED OUT SO I'M JUST

02:58:26.028 --> 02:58:27.196
