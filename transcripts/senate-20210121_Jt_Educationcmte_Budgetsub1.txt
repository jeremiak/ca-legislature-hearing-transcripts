WELCOME TO TODAY'S HEARING ON THE VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC OF THE GOVERNOR'S SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLAN. THIS PLAN PROPOSES TO PROVIDE TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO REOPEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OR AS SOON AS THEIR REGIONAL CASE RATES FALL BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL. THE GOVERNOR'S ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE EARLY ACTION TO APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL. THIS HEARING PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EDUCATION POLICY AND FISCAL COMMITTEES TO JOINTLY DISCUSS AND CONSIDER THE MERITS OF THE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLAN. THE FRAMEWORK OF THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS A POSITION A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD IN ENSURING THAT EVERY CHILD REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY MAY LIVE OR BE ENROLLED IN SCHOOL. HAS THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE QUALITY INSTRUCTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. STUDENTS LEARN AND PERFORM AT THEIR BEST IN PERSON AND PARENTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE ANXIOUS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR KIDS DON'T FALL FURTHER BEHIND. TO THE PANDEMIC. I SHARE THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF RETURNING TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS QUICKLY AND SAFELY AS POSSIBLE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS AROUND THE PLANT. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE COMPONENTS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AFFECT THE RE OPENING PLANS A VERY SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUPPORT DISTRICTS THAT CHOOSE TO RE OPEN UNDER THIS PROPOSAL AND ASSIST EDUCATORS IN BEST SERVING OUR YOUNGEST AND MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. THE STATE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLAN IS VERY BOLD WELL IT HELPS TO SCHOOLS OPEN SAFELY. WE DON'T KNOW WE HOPE TO FIND THAT OUT TODAY. THANK YOU TO ALL THE WITNESSES I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU AND AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SENATOR LAYERED IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKING OPENING REMARKS. CENTER LAYERED I WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. THE END OF. THE CHAIR DID A GREAT JOB OF OUTLINING OUTLINING THE- THE PROPOSAL AND SOME OF THE ISSUES IN FRONT OF US AND I JUST WANT pTHAT DON'T. ALL AGREE ON ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IN PERSON EDUCATION IS PREFERABLE TO ONLINE EDUCATION DISTANCE LEARNING THEIR NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS IN A DISTANCE LEARNING WHETHER IT'S OUR KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS HOMELESS KIDS FOSTER KIDS. ARE DOES IT DEPEND ON SCHOOLS FOR NUTRITION OR KIDS THAT ARE CAUGHT ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND HAVING SAID THAT THE QUESTION WHICH WAS ALSO STATED BY THE CHAIR IS HOW WE REACHED OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY. AND I THINK THERE ARE JUST A FEW PRINCIPLES AND THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER. OF THE FUNDING IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE SCHOOL'S REOPENING GRANT SURE SHOULD THE SHOULD SUPPORT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN PRIORITIZE EQUITY THE PLAN SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR COHERENT PATH FOR SCHOOLS TO RE OPEN WHILE GRANTING FLEXIBILITY SO DISTRICTS CAN MEET THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES. FACING EACH SCHOOL COMMUNITY. RULES MUST BE SO FIRST. TEACHERS AND STAFF SCHOOLS NEED CONSISTENT STANDARDS AND RELIABLE SUPPORTERS AND THERE NEEDS TO BE SUPPORT FOR SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ALREADY REOPENED AND I THINK THAT TODAY. IT'S AGAINST THOSE PRINCIPLES AND THOSE NEEDS WILL HEAR THE TESTIMONY AND HOPE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON WHAT WE THINK IS A GOOD PLAN FOR SAFE WE RE OPENING SCHOOLS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED. I WOULD WE HAVE ANY OTHER SENATORS WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT AND REMOTELY I DON'T SEE ANY RAISED HANDS SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. BUT BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OUR SPEAKERS I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW. PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER. 844-291-6364 WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE NINE OH NINE. EIGHT SIX FOUR NINE NOW LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER JESSICA HOLMES WHO IS AN ASSISTANT PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELCOME MISS HOLMES. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT. CARE I AM FROM FINANCED. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A- WHILE CHILDREN ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET. THREE THREE LOW WHO VOTED NINETEEN ADULT BIRTHDAY REALIZE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY BLESSED IT IS BY THE PENDEK. A MAJORITY OF THE STATE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS IN PERSON INSTRUCTOR AND LAST MARCH. WITH PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS WALDRON LEARNING HOW. ALL NATIONAL WELL BEING. FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THEM WHAT THE REPORT ON THE FEDERAL BUDGET CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTED THAT NATIONALLY. TION OF MENTAL HEALTH REALLY IS IT A LITTLE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CHILDREN AGED FIVE TO ELEVEN YEARS. AND ADOLESCENTS AGE TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN YEARS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 24% AND 31% RESPECTIVELY COMPARED WITH THOSE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ANECDOTAL REPORTS HER SCHOOL OFFICIALS INDICATE SIMILAR POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON STUDENT LEARNING AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. COMPOUNDING THESE ISSUES THE LACK OF INTERPERSONAL INTERACTIONS RESULTING FROM THE PANDEMIC ALSO MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT CHILDREN WILL FEED THE SERVICES NECESSARY TO MITIGATE AND MANAGE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. BECAUSE OF THIS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CHILDREN HAVE THE OPTION TO RETURNED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND SOON AND IF THEY FLEE IF POSSIBLE. TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS OF MORE THAN SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION CAN ABLE SCHOOL CAN MITIGATE CODED NINETEEN PANDEMIC IMPACT ON STUDENTS AND STAFF. AND PROVIDED GOLD GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES TO MAXIMIZE STATE AND KIRSTEN INSTRUCTION TO STUDENTS. HOWEVER AS THE PANDEMIC PROGRESSES AND AS THE SCIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING OF KOBE NINETEEN INCREASES WE MUST BE ADAPTABLE TO OUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND SEIZE ON OPPORTUNITIES AND THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC HONORED CHILDREN. WHICH IS NOT IN THE ADMINISTRATION UPDATED AT TALKING THANK YOU GOTTEN FOR AND PERCENT TRACTION RECOGNITION THAT MASKING SOCIAL DISTANCING CO HOARDING AND OTHER KEY MEASURES. ARE EXCELLENT SAFEGUARDS TO MINIMIZE MINIMIZE VIRUS SPREAD IN CAN OFFER PATHWAYS TO SCHOOL RE OPENING EVEN IN COMMUNITIES. ARE RIGHT TO COMMUNITIES BETTER HIGH. CASH ADDITIONALLY WE ARE KEEN TO. IMPROVING OUR INTEREST TO. TOOLS AND PUTTING HEALTH SAFEGUARD IN PLACE. MAKING IT EASIER FOR EDUCATION AND STREETERS TO GET ONE ON ONE GUIDANCE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. AN ACCESS CODE NINETEEN TESTING. AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR SCHOOL STAFF AND COMMUNITIES TO ALERT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. BUT HEALTH CONDITIONS AT SCHOOL CONCERNED THEM. SH BY COLLEAGUE BROOKS ALLEN WILL GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON THESE TOPICS BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR PROGRESS. IN BRINGING STUDENTS AND STAFF BACK TO CAMPUS IS SAFELY. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY MANAGEMENT AND LABOR HAVE BEEN ASKED TO BE INCREDIBLY FLEXIBLE AND RESPONSIVE. TO THE EVER CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR TIRELESS WORK IN TRYING TO GET STUDENTS THE VERY BEST ACCESS TO EDUCATION SERVICES. IN THE MOST CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ANY OF US HAD EVER SEEN. WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE TIRED IN WITH VERY GOOD REASON AND THAT YOU ARE DOING THE BEST THAT YOU CAN AND FOR THAT WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL. WE KNOW THAT FURTHER FORWARD PROGRESS REQUIRES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND TO THAT END THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING TO BILLION FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT. THIS GRANT YOUR INTENDED TO BUILD ON TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INVESTMENTS AND PAIR WITH SIX BILLION IN FEDERAL ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND THAT WILL SOON BE MADE AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS. GRANTLAND CENTRALIZED AND FUNDS BAKERY OPENING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN THE STATE INCLUDING CHILDREN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE STUDENTS WITH pDISABILITIES. AND THE STATE'S YOUNGEST LEARNERS. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL. ARE ELLIE. WITH RELATIVE LOW COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATE THE HAVE PLANS IN PLACE FOR STATE SAFE REOPENING BY FEBRUARY FIRST. WILL RECEIVE PROPORTIONALLY LARGER GRANT AMOUNTS BUT ELIUD NEEDING MORE PLAYING TIME CAN APPLY FOR GRANTS BY MARCH FIRST TO RECEIVE FUNDING A SLIGHTLY LOWER BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. L. USING COMMUNITY HIGH TRANSMISSION CAN ALSO APPLY FOR GRANTS ON EITHER DATE AND RECEIVED GRANT FUNDING BUT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. UNTIL COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATE ACCORDING. EARLY FEEDBACK ON THIS PROPOSAL HAS CENTERED LARGELY ON A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC AREAS BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS NOW- BUT I RECOGNIZE YOU MAY HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS OR HAVE FURTHER CONCERNS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE AFTER THE PANEL PRESENTATIONS. FIRST I WANT TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT EQUITY. WE HAVE RECEIVED COMMENTS BUT THE PROPOSAL WILL FAVOR WEALTHIER ELEAZAR ELEAZAR ALREADY OPEN. AND L. USING COUNTY THAT LOWER TRANSMISSION RATES. WE WOULD NOTE ELEAZAR CAN APPLY FOR THE GRANTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR TRANSMISSION RATE AND RECEIVE COMPATIBLE FUNDING. ADDITIONALLY GRANT AMOUNTS ARE INCREASED FOR ELEAZAR SERVING LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. CASH JOHN HOW THE THIRD THAT FAMILIES IN AREAS WITH HIGH TRANSMISSION RATE MAYBE MORE RETICENT TO SEND CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL MAKING ELEAZAR NEED AREAS AN ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR FUNDING HOWEVER THIS ISN'T TRUE. I'LL YOU NEED ONLY TO OFFER THE OPTION IT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FAMILIES TO RECEIVE GRANT FUNDING FAMILIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RETURN IF THAT IS THEIR PREFERENCE. ADDITIONALLY THE RECENT UPDATES TO HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT MECHANISM FOR FAMILIES WITH SCHOOL STAFF. ARE INTENDED TO HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION CAN BE DONE SAFELY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT FAMILIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF RETURNED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO RETURN STUDENTS TO SCHOOL CAMPUSES IF THEY SEE THAT THE CHILDREN OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE ABLE TO RETURN SAFELY. THE QUESTION THE FEASIBILITY OF EARLY AGE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A COMPLETED SAFETY PLAN RELATED COSTS RELATED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CO THAT NINETEEN SURVEILLANCE TESTING. PRIOR TO THE FEBRUARY FIRST AND MARCH FIRST DEADLINE FOR GRANT. TWENTY NOTE THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO RECEIVE THE GRANT IS NOT REQUIRED UNTIL FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH OR MARCH SIXTEENTH OR UNTIL AN ALLEY A WITHIN A HIGH TRANSMISSION. TELL ME DROPS BELOW HAD DECRYING TRANSMISSION RATES. SH BUT WE ARE TAKING YOUR COMMENT SERIOUSLY I DO WANT TO ENSURE THAT PARTICIPATION THE GRANT PROGRAM IS PRACTICABLE FOR AS MANY. AS POSSIBLE. WE WANT SCHOOL TO OPEN. HOWEVER WE RECOGNIZE THERE MAY BE CHAO FIRST LED NEEDING FRENCH. MOSTLY IS ARE NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON THREE D. PLAN SINCE LAST MARCH AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE RECENTLY RELEASED HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE STATE. REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR THE GRANT ARCHIE MOBILE AND ESSENTIAL TO A QUICK AND SAFE RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY ADDITIONAL CONCERNS OR ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS MAY HAVE A BETTER PROPOSAL FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT. HOWEVER I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE BROOS ALLEN FROM THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO DISCUSS THE OTHER PILLARS OF OUR PROPOSAL TO CREATE SAFE PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF. TO RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS HOLMES MISTER ALAN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY PLEASE GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR SANDERS. MY NAME'S BROOKS ALLEN NOW THE PLEASURE OF SERVING AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE PARK EDUCATION. I'M JUST LIKE A BREEZE PERSON NOTE. ON MY CALLER IN THIS HALL COMMENTS AS A OF THE GRADER A SEVEN GRADER. WHO ARE IN DISTANCE OR AND HAVE BEEN SATISFIED MARCH ARE AND HAVE. MANY FOR AND COLLEAGUES FUTURE. AND WORKING AND DISTRICTS ACROSS THIS. ARE I JUST CAN'T OUTSIDE. HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE TO ALL SCHOOLS- WORK IN IT EVERY LEVEL TO SUPPORT. EDUCATION F OUR STUDENTS FROM THOSE. WORKING ABROAD MALES. ARE THOSE WORKING- YOU KNOW ON THE SCHOOL SIDE CONSULTANT JUST TECHNOLOGIES THERE AS WELL AS EDUCATORS. I REALLY DON'T PARTICULARLY IN THINGS- TO MAKE THINGS WORK IN THIS IN THIS VERY CHALLENGING TIME. I JUST LIKE TO OFFER MY. DEEP THANKS ALL RIGHT OFF THE TOP. I'M YES MY- ON AND- THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOLS BROADWAY. IT WAS RELEASED DECEMBER. IT IS COMPOSED OF FOUR MUTUALLY REINFORCING DOLLARS. OF DISCO SMALL VOTER CONTINUE OUR SAY AND TO EXPAND OF SMALL STATE RESUMING IN PARSONS. ASPIRINS RATES THE GREENS. BASED ON WHAT EARNINGS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SKINNER. THE SIX GOALS FOR ALL EVENTS THE SPREAD. TO CREATE SAFE LEARN ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS. AND SAFE WORKPLACES FOR AN AND ALL SCHOOLS. WITH A FOCUS ON WELL PLANNED IMPLEMENTATION AND BUILDING CONFIDENCE THROUGH MAINTAINING SAFE OPERATIONS WHERE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN. REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SERVED AS WELL AS BRINGING BACK OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND OUR MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED STUDENTS FIRST INCLUDING AS MISS HOLMES ADDED AS I NOTED EARLIER OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES OUR FOSTER YOUTH OUR STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS. AND THOSE SALAS WAS STRUCK BY CENTER EARLIER GO ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. AND THEN A FOCUS ON BRINGING BACK THE OTHER GRADE. LEVELS WHICH SCHOOLS ARE NOT OPEN YET. I MISS HOMES OR COVER THE FILM MILLER OF THIS PLAN. BUT AS THESE BILLS ARE MAY TO BE MUTUALLY. I LIKE TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE REMAINING THREE PILLARS OF THE PLAN. STARTING WITH THE SAFETY MITIGATION FILLER. WHICH REALLY STARTS WITH THE CONSOLIDATED AND UPDATED GUIDANCE ISSUED LAST WEEK BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. BUILDING ON THE GUIDANCE ORIGINALLY ISSUED LAST JUNE. THIS UPDATED GUIDANCE CONSOLIDATES THE CALLOSUM REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO ALL EMPLOERS. AND BECAME EFFECTIVE ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH OF LAST YEAR. AND REQUIREMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT THE STATE WAS ISSUED LAST JUNE. THIS GUIDANCE NOW REQUIRES THAT MASKS WILL BE WORN BY ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF AGE AND% RECOMMENDS DISPOSABLE SURGICAL MASKS FOR STAFF WHO COME INTO REGULAR CONTACT WITH OTHERS. AND NOTABLY ON THIS POINT ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOW ABLE TO LEVERAGE ST GOSHEN MASTER CONTRACTS FOR THESE MASKS. ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE LATEST SCIENCE REGARDING HOW IN PERSON INSTRUCTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED SAFELY SPECIALLY FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REVISE THE PROCESS FOR SCHOOLS SERVING ELEMENTARY GRADES TO RESUME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IF THEY'RE IN THE PURPLE TEAR REPLACING THE PREVIOUSLY OR PROCESS. UNDER OUR BLUEPRINT FOR SAFER CON. DON'T EXPLAIN HIS LATEST UPDATES INCLUDING THE LATEST RATIONALE AND EVIDENCE OF THE STATE SAFE SCHOOLS TEAM WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY COME OUT CREATED HAS BEEN HOSTING REGULAR WEBINARS FOR EDUCATORS SCHOOL STAFF AND LEADERS UP AND DOWN STATE. ON NEARLY A WEEKLY BASIS. IN ADDITION NEW RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL CENTER CODE NINETEEN TESTING HAVE BEEN ISSUED. AND THE STATE IS COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING ALL SCHOOLS IMPLEMENT TESTING UP TO ONCE A WEEK. FOR STUDENTS AND FOR STAFF INCLUDING ACCESS TO THE STATE BUILT AND OPERATED VALENCIA BRANCH LAB. WHICH OFFERS PCR TEST AT ONE THIRD THE MARKET RATE. AND FORTY EIGHT HOUR TURNAROUNDS. ALL THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO'VE BEEN SEEKING PERMISSION BE WATCHING DAY ON THE STATE'S KOBE NINETEEN WEBSITE AND THEN ONCE BRANCH LEVINE. WITH RESPECT WERE THIRD OF THE OVERSEE AND SINCE DOLLAR. THE NEW STE SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM WHICH IS ACROSS TO TAKE LED BY DR NAOMI BY. AND COMPOSE OF DESIGNATED EXPERTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH CAL OSHA AND EDUCATIONALLY THESE. ARE HELPING TO OVERSEE AND ASSIST LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION OF SAFE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. IT TO SUPPORT THIS OVERSIGHT. TO DIRECTIVES WERE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH LAST WEEK IT REQUIRED TWO THINGS THAT I KNOW ARE OF GREAT INTEREST. TO ALL OF US. ONE IS TO HAVE SCHOOLS REPORT ON THE REOPENING OF STATUS SCALE AND MODEL EVERY OTHER WEEK. SO STARTING WITH NEXT MONDAY ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH. WE'LL START GATHERING THE STATE I WAS STATEWIDE BASIS SO WE WILL KNOW IN LA LEVEL UP BY MY SCHOOL BY GRADE SPAN. AWARE FOLKS ARE OPEN AND TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE OPEN. AND CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW REPORTING OF ANY POSITIVE COPING NINETEEN CASES FOR INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN ON SCHOOL SITES. WILL NEED TO BE REPORTED LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL THEN REPORT THAT DATA UP TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN TERMS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SCHOOL LEADERS SEEKING GUIDANCE REGARDING HOW TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT SAFETY MEASURES. ARE ABLE TO REQUEST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE SCHOOL SAFETY SCHEME BY SUBMITTING A REQUEST OUR NEW STATE SCHOOLS FOR ALL HUB. WHERE ALL THIS CONSOLIDATED GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE POSTED. AND FINALLY THE FOURTH PILLAR OF THESE FOUR INTERLOCKING PILLARS IS THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PILLAR. AND FOR THIS PIECE THE TELEPORTING DIRECTIVES THAT JUST MENTIONED BOTH REGARDING REOPENING STATUS AS WELL AS REPORTING OF CASES WILL END UP SUPPORTING AN INTERACTIVE GIS MAP THAT WILL BE LAUNCHED ON THAT SAME STATE SCHOOLS FROM HIGH UP IN THE COMING WEEKS. OVERRIDE THAT TRANSPARENCY AS WELL AS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADEQUATE SAFETY MEASURES. IN ADDITION WE LAUNCHED ASAFETY PROBLEM HOTLINE FOR SCHOOL STAFF AND PARENTS TO SUBMIT ANY SAFETY CONCERNS THEY MAY HAVE. ABOUT SPECIFIC SCHOOLS EITHER ONLINE OR VIA TELEPHONE. AND THE PHONE NUMBERS POSTED ON THAT SPACE- STATE SCHOOLS HELP SITE THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. THE CITY SCHOOLS TEAM WORK MONITOR THESE REPORTS AND WHEN APPROPRIATE. PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OR IF NECESSARY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS HELP ASSIST US ALL GET TO A PLACE WE HAVE A SAFE WORKPLACE AND SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. FINALLY WE'VE ISSUED AN ALL COUNTY LETTER ON THE WENT OUT LAST WEEK IT'S GREATER CLARITY IN HIGHLY KEY ISSUES AROUND ISSUES SUCH AS WHEN A SCHOOL IS DEEMED TO BE OPEN. OTHER BEEN RAISED BY SCHOOLS ARE AND IF NOT WOULD PROVIDE- TO ALL DISTRICTS AND ALL COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. IN SOME THESE FOUR PILLARS OF ALL SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLAN FUNDING. SAFETY MITIGATION OVERSIGHT ASSISTANCE AND TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE A SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND LEARNING ENVIRONMENT OUR EDUCATORS SCHOOL STAFF AND STUDENTS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. RESIDENTS ON SAID I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THESE DOLLARS ON WEARABLE PROVIDE TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER ALLEN NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM AMY LEE WHO IS A FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. MISLI THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SENATORS AMY LEE WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TODAY I'M JOINED BY TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE L. EEO AFTER CABRAL THE DEPUTY OF THE K. TWELVE TEAM AND SONYA PADDOCK WHO COVERS. PUBLIC HEALTH FOR OFFICE. LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT WE THINK IT IS WORTHWHILE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO REOPEN. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CITING RESEARCH INDICATES THAT YOUNGER CHILDREN MAY PARTICULARLY BENEFIT FROM BEING BROUGHT BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. ESPECIALLY FOR THEIR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. MORE RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT YOUNGER CHILDREN CAN BE BROUGHT BACK INTO SCHOOL SAFELY EVEN WHEN TRANSITION RATES ARE HIGH. HOWEVER AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY CRAFTING WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THE PROPOSAL WILL BE. AN ULTIMATELY GETTING SCHOOLS REOPENED EARLIER. AND WE HAVE A HANDOUT THAT WALKS YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS I BELIEVE THIS YEAR THAT WAS PROVIDED TO SENATORS IN ADVANCE AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN FIND THIS HANDOUT. AND THE ONLY A WEBSITE AT L. E. O. DOT CA DOT GOP ON THE RIGHT HAND ARE LABELED OTHER PUBLICATIONS. I AM I WOULD ALSO BE HAPPY TO SHARE THE HEAD ON THE SCREEN OF THE SENATORS WITH MIKE. PLEASE DO. OKAY. SORRY IT SEEMS AS THOUGH I'M NOT ABLE TO SHARE MY SCREEN- NO WORRIES OF THE AREA OKAY. ONCE AGAIN PLEASE. OKAY. WE COULD SEE JUST FINE THANK YOU OKAY PERFECT- SO. BEGINNING ON THE FIRST PAGE ON BACKGROUND IN AUGUST THE GOVERNOR ESTABLISHED K. FOURTEEN FRAMEWORK WHICH HELPS GUIDE SCHOOL RE OPENING FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION I THINK THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT MOST OF US ARE RATHER FAMILIAR WITH AT THIS POINT. COUNTIES FALL INTO ONE OF FOUR TIERS RANGING FROM PURPLE WHERE TRANSMISSION IS WIDESPREAD TO JELLO OUR TRANSMISSION IS MINIMAL LAST THURSDAY ON JANUARY FOURTEENTH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RELEASED UPDATED GUIDANCE THAT LOWERS THE RE OPENING CRITERIA FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS. THIS UPDATE WAS MOTIVATED BY NEW RESEARCH SHOWING THAT- YOUNGER CHILDREN TYPICALLY HAVE LOWER RATES OF INFECTION AND TRANSMISSION OF COMPLETE NINETEEN. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. SO IN THIS FIGURE OUT WE COMPARE ADVANCED SCHOOL RE OPENING HER CRITERIA UNDER THE GUIDANCE RELEASED IN AUGUST WITH THE UPDATED GUIDANCE RELEASED EARLIER THIS MONTH STARTING WITH THE TOP ROW FOR HIGH NEED STUDENTS AND WHEN WE SAY HIGH NEEDS WE TYPICALLY REFER TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. STUDENTS ARE CONSIDERED MOST AT RISK FOR FALLING BEHIND UNDER CONTINUE DISTANCE LEARNING DISTRICTS MAY BRING BACK HIGH NEED STUDENTS AND SMALL CORDS AT ANYTIME REGARDLESS OF TIER AND THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THIS CRITERIA UNDER THE UPDATED GUIDANCE. MOVING ONTO THE NEXT ROW FOR ELEMENTARY STUDENTS PREVIOUSLY SCHOOLS COULD ONLY OPEN FOR THESE GRADES AFTER BEING IN THE RIGHT HERE WHERE TRANSMISSION IS SUBSTANTIAL FOR AT LEAST FOURTEEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS THIS IS UNLESS THE SCHOOL OF TEAMS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WEAVER THROUGH THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. UNDER THE UPDATED GUIDANCE DISTRICTS CAN BRING BACK ELEMENTARY GRADES AFTER CASE RATES FALL BELOW TWENTY FIVE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THIS THRESHOLD IS STILL WITH IN THE PURPLE CARE MEANING THAT UNDER THE UPDATED GUIDANCE SOME ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO REOPEN IN PURPLE TIER RATHER THAN BRED AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE. ON THE UPDATED GUIDANCE ALSO HOLDS THAT PREVIOUS WAIVER PROCESS HOWEVER PREVIOUSLY APPROVED WAIVERS REMAIN VALID. WESLEY FOR OLDER GRADES NOT LAST ROAD AFTER GETTING GUIDANCE ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO BRING STUDENTS BACK AFTER BEING IN THE RIGHT HERE FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS THE STORE IS THE PERIOD FROM FOURTEEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE. SO ALONG WITH THE UPDATED GUIDANCE THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED OTHER EFFORTS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AND THESE ARE THE OTHER PILLARS THAT MR AND WE MENTIONED EARLIER SORRY. I'LL JUST MOVE PAST THAT. HERE WE KNOW IT'S THAT SCHOOLS LEARN HAVE DISCRETION OVER WHEN AND HOW TO RE OPEN. ALTHOUGH UNDER THE NEW STATE GUIDANCE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE REOPENED OR PLAN TO REOPEN MUST PUBLICLY POST. AND SUBMIT SCHOOL REOPENING PLANS TO COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND- VESTI CROSS AGENCY TEAM AND THAT IS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S. INITIATIVES ON A SCHOOL REOPENING- AND THIS TEAM IS CONSISTING OF THE CALIFORNIA BERMAN PUBLIC HEALTH- CALIFORNIA CAL OSHA AND THE AND EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. HOWEVER IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS LOCAL DISCRETION OVER WHEN TO RE OPEN THAT IN THE FALL WHEN HE STREETS FOR LOWER ACROSS THE STATE- IN MANY DISTRICTS CONSIDERED RE OPENING NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL. SCHOOL YEAR THE ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO CONTINUE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING IN ANTICIPATION OF THE HOLIDAY SURGE. THIS MEANS HOWEVER THAT MOST SCHOOLS HAVE OFFERED ANY SIGNIFICANT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SINCE LAST MARCH. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING THAT COULD. BE USED TO SUPPORT SCHOOL RE OPENING. WE ON TO THE NEXT HE. OKAY SO HERE WE PROVIDE DETAILS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I'M OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ALREADY DESCRIBED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN DETAIL I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOESN'T INCLUDE ENGLISH LEARNERS AND THEIR HIGH NEED STUDENTS DEFINITION REYES STATE GUIDANCE TYPICALLY DOES INCLUDE THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS UNDER THE HIGH NEEDS CATEGORY. SO WITH THAT I THINK I'LL JUST MOVE ON TO THE ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION. I'M HERE WE OFFER- DAY LEGISLATURE JUST SOME ISSUES TO CONSIDER PRIMARILY WE DON'T THINK THE PROPOSAL ALLOWS ENOUGH TIME FOR DISTRICTS TO COMPLETE THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. TO MEET THE FEBRUARY FIRST DEADLINE WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A WEEK FROM TODAY DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO UPDATE THEIR SCHOOL WE OPENING PLANS ARE RANGE FOR ROUTINE TESTING. AND GO SHE WITH THEIR LABOR UNIONS THIS MAY BE SPECIFICALLY CHALLENGING FOR SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SINCE MARCH. WE'RE ALSO UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOL OPENING- THAT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T PROVIDE AUGMENTATION TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF BUDGETS TO SUPPORT THIS ADDITIONAL WORK. LASTLY WE NOTES THAT AND THAT PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED IS UNLIKELY TO LEAD TO EARLIER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. I THINK THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS FIRST TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR EAST ROUTINE EXAMS ATIX TESTING. AS OFTEN AS EVERY WEEK FOR ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF NGUYEN TRANSMISSION RATES ARE HIGH THIS ADDS MORE COMPLEX LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES TO SCHOOL RE OPENING WHICH IS ALREADY A RATHER LOGISTICALLY CHALLENGING ENDEAVOR TO BEGIN WITH. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING UNDER THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AND DISTRICTS WOULD ESSENTIALLY NEED TO RUN THEIR OWN TESTING OPERATION WE THINK THIS IS LIKELY TO DAMPEN OVERALL INTEREST IN SCHOOL PARTICIPATION IN THE GRANT PROGRAM. SECONDLY KOBE NINETEEN CASE RATES ARE RATHER HIGH ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT NOW GREATER THAN A HUNDRED CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AS OF JANUARY NINETEENTH THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE RECENT DATA THAT WAS INCLUDED AND HAND OUT. THE CURRENTLY ONLY SIX COUNTIES FALL BELOW THE TWENTY FIVE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND THRESHOLD FOR SCHOOLS. FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL RE OPENING GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OVER WHEN CASE RATES WILL FALL AND THE CORRESPONDING DELAY IN SCHOOL REOPENING WE THINK THE PROPOSAL MIGHT ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT. ACTUALLY RESULTS IN MUCH MORE IN PER SINISTRA AND- TURNING TO OUR LAST. HERE- WE PROVIDE THE- WHEN YOU SEE A FEW OP TO CONSIDER MANY OF THESE OPTIONS ARE GEARED TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER- FIRST THE LEGISLATURE COULD MODIFY THE PROPOSAL TO REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION ALL HIGH NEED STUDENTS A MONTH BEFORE THE OTHER ELEMENTARY GRADES THIS ALLOWS SCHOOLS UNEF TIME TO RAMP UP THEIR TESTING CAPACITY AND ADDRESS OTHER IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WITH SCHOOL RE OPENING WITH A SMALLER GROUP OF STAFF AND STUDENTS FIRST. WHILE STILL PROVIDING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO BENEFITS TO STUDENTS WHO WOULD LARGELY BENEFIT FROM IT I'M SECONDS THAT LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER INCLUDING SOME FLEXIBILITIES ON A SYMPTOMATIC TESTING REQUIREMENTS WE THINK THIS IS THE ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL MOST LIKELY TO REDUCE SCHOOL PARTICIPATION THE LEGISLATURE FOR EXAMPLE COULD PROVIDE DISTRICTS AN OPTION TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE TESTING KEEP AND WHAT THEIR LABOR PARTNERS OR ALLOW DISTRICTS TO TEST ALL STAFF WEEKLY BUT A LOT OF RANDOM SAMPLING OF STUDENTS ON A WEEKLY BASIS. WE THINK THIS APPROACH- ACKNOWLEDGES THAT YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE JUST AT LOWER RISK OF TRANSMITTING COPING NINETEEN BUT STILL ALLOWS FOR ROUTINE. TESTING IN A MORE FEASIBLE WAY. WESLEY FROM THE FROM. AND THEN LEGISLATURE LOOK AT WAY TO INCREASE. TESTING CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW SCHOOLS TO MORE EASILY ACCESS ROUTINE TESTING ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS OFFERED SCHOOLS ACCESS TO THE STATE SUPPORTED VALENCIA BRANCH LAB. BASED ON EARLY ESTIMATES THE TESTING CAPACITY SET ASIDE FOR SCHOOLS. ME ONLY SUPPORT A PORTION OF ELEMENTARY STUDENTS STATEWIDE. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT EXPANDING STATEWIDE TESTING CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD REQUIRE NOT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH MY CAREER FIRST. I THINK WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS LEE. MEMBERS I'D DAHLE NOW LIKE TO TURN IT BACK TO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF ANY OF OUR PANELISTS. DR PAMELA WITH YOU AND THEN DOT ON CENTER LAYERED GO AHEAD RICHARD. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS FROM BOTH A FINANCE BOARD EDUCATION AND THE L. A. L- YES MY FIVE FIRST QUESTION IS- BUT MAYBE TO THE STATE- TO- MISTER ALAN AT THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION NICE TO TALK TO YOU WE HAVE THE SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM THAT'S GREAT- I'VE I THINK AN OPPORTUNITY TALKED. TO SOME OF THE- FOLKS ON THEIR- YOU KNOW ALIA IS BROUGHT UP AND- AND I AM. SERVING GREENMAN I MEAN WHAT'S THE CAPACITY OF THIS TEAM TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO WE HAVE A THOUSAND THIRTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE SO LAW SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I REALIZE THAT MANY OF THEM- PERHAPS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON VARIOUS SAFETY. PLANS BUT- IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO MEET SOME OF THE PARAMETERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SEPARATE FIRST BUT JUST AND ON ANY TIMELINE- YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SO FORTH. HAVE AND WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM SCHOOL SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL IN THE NEXT PANEL BUT- CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO THE CAPACITY OF THIS GROUP TO PROVIDE TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO. THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN YOU SPEAK TO FOR EXAMPLE HAS TECHNICAL SYSTEMS BEEN AVAILABLE I REALIZE THAT WE HAVEN'T PASSED THIS PROPOSAL YET BUT ANTICIPATION. HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THREE REACHED OUT OF THE REACHED OUT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND AT LEAST GOTTEN ASSESSMENT OF WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS GENERALLY ARE HE SAID MANY OF THEM WORKING ON SAFETY PLANS IN TERMS OF THEIR- OWN CAPACITIES THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO- TO FIGURE OUT MANY OF THE LOGISTICS INVOLVED IN TRYING TO IMPLEMENTSUCH A PLAN SO FOR EXAMPLE STE. SETTING UP RETAIL SURVEILLANCE TESTING AT ITS ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN A PLACE WHERE THEY VERY WORK SOME OF THAT OUT THERE FREE ARE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BILLS FROM GROUND UP AND- DO THEY EVEN HAVE ANY IDEA. HOW TO DO IT- WITHOUT IT- TELL ME THAT NEED TO. SAYS TO FIGURE OUT EVEN JUST TO STAY UP AND THAT'S ONE COMPONENT THIS WHOLE PROPOSAL SO. I CAN JUST SPEAK TO THE S. SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM CAPACITY. AND UNDER. THE TO ASSIST. POTENTIALLY UP TO A THOUSAND THIRTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND PROVIDING GOOD. SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE. PRACTICAL GUIDANCE WOULD ACTUALLY STAND UP THERE ARE THINGS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO READ THIS PROPOSAL. YEAH ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I WOULD WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE'S OF THE STATE SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM IS ONE KEY COMPONENT AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN DEALING WITH THE SCALE ON. YOU JUST HIGHLIGHTED. ALL WE HAVE TO TAKE ON MULTIPLE STRATEGIES AND SO ONE THING I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND HIGHLIGHT IS THE FACT THAT. THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL WORK THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING EVER SINCE LAST MARCH. WE'VE HAD OF BOTH DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES ARE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS I PROVIDE A LOT OF ASSISTANCE. IN THESE AREAS INCLUDING A WITH THE SUPPORT OF ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE FROM HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS ISN'T ISN'T NEW RIGHT IT IS I THINK WE ALL KNOW- WHAT WE CREATE IS PART OF THE STATE'S. SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL TEAM IS TO PROVIDE A HOME FOR WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE HEARING. IN THEIR CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- INCLUDING USING EFFICIENCIES LIKE MEETING. AS WE RECENTLY JUST DID THAT TWO DAYS AGO WITH ALL THE SUPERINTENDENTS AND ONE COUNTY WITH THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. OUGHT TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS ARE COMING UP THROUGH A VARIETY OF DISTRICTS- DANCES QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE- THE TOUGHEST DANCER. ALSO THE STATE SCHOOL SAFETY SCHEME CAN HELP PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE TO BOTH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND TO DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- THIS IS DONE AT SCALE BOTH BY DOING. WEBINARS THAT WE DISCUSSED HOSTING VIDEOS AND TRAINING. ONLINE ON STILL SCHOOLS HUG AND THEN HAVING THIS INTAKE PROCEDURE WHERE YOU HAVE VERY SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHERE YOU HAVE TOUGH QUESTIONS THAT COME UP. HOW THEY CAN BE TACKLED AND IT HAS BEEN A DIRECT ONE ON ONE ASSISTANCE WITH DISTRICTS TO DO THAT BOTH ON ISSUES AROUND DISTANCING. MASKS ARE STABLE GROUPS ACCORDING. OUT BUT ALSO SPECIFICALLY TO THE QUESTION AROUND TESTING. OUR OUR COLLEAGUES FROM HELD HIM. SERVICE AGENCY HAS BEING- YOU KNOW FROM BEEN WORKING WITH. ACCOUNT INTO TO HOW ON THEM WITH THE LANDSCAPE LAB PROVIDE THAT ASSIST. I'LL PROVIDE BIGGIO'S. I TO DO HAPPEN ALSO DOING A LOT ONE ON ONE AND HOLD. BUT DO YOU SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IS WE A WORK WITH OUR ACCOUNT HOUSE THAT. THANK REACH OUT TO LOCAL. I'VE IN THEIR JR. SO I GUESS JUST A FOLLOW ON THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM STE. AT LEAST SUPER- OR THE BOARD PRESIDENT TO SEE.IF I GO IN. TALK TO MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. IN ASSAM STUDENTS SAY DO YOU HAVE ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED- HAVE YOU GOTTEN ENOUGH HELP FROM. THE SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM AND THEY ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU NEED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT IT WITHOUT STUDY CEDARS OTHER THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO TO IMPLEMENT IT- THE ANSWER SHE TEARS YES. IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE OUR HOPE YES AND INDICATES THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WE HAVE A GREAT RESOURCE WHERE THEY CAN GO BOTH. ON THE WEBSITE WHERE WE HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH THOSE QUESTIONS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY- I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE PROBABLY SOME NEW QUESTIONS THAT COME OUT JUST FROM LAST THURSDAY AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING- NEARLY DAILY AT. BAILEY WEBINARS AND A DIRECT INTERACTIONS HELP ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS SO. WE KNOW THAT CERTAINLY SOME QUESTIONS PERSISTING THE GIVEN ON SOME OF THE NEW CONSOLIDATE GUIDANCE. WE ANSWERING THOSE BUT BUT CERTAINLY I WOULD HOPE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY ARE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN CLEAR. OKAY SO I- YEAH I THINK SOMETIMES. TOP LEVEL LIKE YOU PULSE BUT I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS A HERE YOU SAID YOU TALKED YOU KNOW METHODS TO PRETEND INSTANT. COMING OFF THE EDUCATION THOSE ARE CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT. BUT CERTAINLY THE CORE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS. THIS ALSO A COLLABORATION WITH LABOR LET'S- THE BARGAINING UNITS. IS THERE ALSO EQUAL- EFFORT BEING MADE TO MEET WITH- BARGAINING UNITS WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM TEACHERS AND- SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND OTHER STAFF AT CETERA. TO ALSO. TALK ABOUT THE EVIDENCE AROUND. SCHOOL SAFETY. TRANSMISSION ETCETERA SO THAT WERE SO THAT AS THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE- UNIONS ARE- AND ACCORDING TO THIS EXCERPT OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT- JUSTIN OR- WHATEVER TO SUCCESS THE APPLY. THAT THEY'RE WORKING FROM THE SAME SET OF FACTS ABOUT RISKS AND SO FORTH- I THINK THAT. SOMETIMES I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT. PEOPLE ARE. KILLED THE N. RIGHTFULLY SO PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE RISKS TO- TO TEACHERS AND STAFF. BUT SOMETIMES BY THE SUSSMAN OF THOSE RISKS- BECAUSE OF LACK OF. INPUT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. MAY BE THE OVERLY ELEVATED ARE NOT. CONSIDER AND SO AS URBAN OUTREACH TO- THOSE EMPLOYEES OR UNIONS- AND THEN ALSO EVEN THE GENERAL PUBLIC BUT LET'S START OFF WITH THE MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER BOTH OF THOSE BUT- I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART SO. PARENTS NEED TO KNOW SAID AND THIS IS A SUPER TENSE AND THEN ALSO THE- THE UNIONS AND THEIR MEMBERS NEED TO KNOW SO WHAT HAVE OUT REACHES BEEN DONE TO- THAT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS AND THEN ALSO TO PARENTS ARE THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. ABOUT THIS. YEAH I KNOW ITS- BACK TO IT. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE FOLLOWING PANELS. WHO HAVE BEEN JOIN US FOR MANY WEBINARS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS- I WOULD AGREE WE'VE HAD EVER SINCE THE ROLLOUT OF THE SAFE SCHOOLS PLAN. WHICH INCLUDES. A COUPLE OF DOCUMENTS SENT TO YOU REFERENCED IN TERMS OF BOTH EXPLAINING THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE PLAN. AGAIN THE BILL ON ALL SCHOOLS ARE A GOOD SAFETY HARBOR AS WELL AS- OTHER DOCUMENT THAT PROVIDES A DISTILLATION OF THE LATEST STUDIES AND RESEARCH. ALL PUT TOGETHER. BUT BALK AT DOCTOR BARDOCK AND LEADING EXPERTS WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- SO THOSE ARE BOTH PART. THEY'VE BEEN SHARED THROUGH THESE WEBINARS INSURANCE OUR GAUGE MEANT- WITH OUR CRITICAL LABOR PARTNERS- DURING THE ROLLOUT IN DISCUSSIONS. ON IN THEY'VE BEEN SHARED- BOTH NOW ON THE WEBSITE AND I KNOW THAT. WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST ME WITH A GROUP OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS- BELIEVE ON TUESDAY OF THIS WEEK AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT ME THESE MATERIALS ARE NOT MAKE IT INTO. THE AIRPORT PACKETS. ON BEING SHARED OUT WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS SO I THINK WE ARE SEEING SOME SUCCESSFUL DISSEMINATION. OF THESE RESOURCES. ARE BOTH TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS WELL AS RESTORE LABOR PARTNERS. AS WE ALL CHEN THIS DISCUSSION TRY TO KEEP UP WITH. THE LATEST STUDIES AND REYES SEVERANCE. OKAY SO I GUESS THE DAY I GUESS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS FOR EXAMPLE I'VE HEARD. AT LEAST READ THE NEWS MADE. THAT FOR EXAMPLES AND SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS- THERE OF PEOPLE SAID THAT UNTIL. ALL THEIR- TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE VACCINATED. THEY'RE NOT GONNA REOPEN. SO IS THAT IT MEANS THAT TO BE A LOOK. TO THE- IS SO I. I'M TRYING TO GET SENSE OF YOU SAID SHARED THIS INFORMATION BUT- AT. THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR OUR SAY THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE STANDARD- GUIDE. US TO REOPEN IT WOULD INDICATE THAT PERHAPS THE SHARING HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH. IS THAT A CONCERN TO YOU. I THINK WE CONTINUE TO SHARE THE BEST INFORMATION WE HAVE AND YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS- THE A LOT OF APPROPRIATE CONCERN- FROM. PARENTS FROM STAFF. IN CERTAIN HAVING UNCERTAINTY ABOUT SAFETY AND SO IT'S BEEN CERTAINLY ONE OF THE CORE COMPONENTS SAYS WE'VE BEEN ROLLING OUT THESE PIECES TO TRY TO PROVIDE. THE BEST EVIDENCE TO BUILD THAT CONFIDENCE AROUND WHAT IS SAFE AND HOW THESE MITIGATION MEASURES WOULD PUT TOGETHER A PARTICULARLY FOR THE EARLIEST GRADES I CAN PROVIDE FOR A SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. SO WE CONTINUE TO DISSEMINATE THAT INFORMATION WE TRY TO. STILL BUILD THAT OUT BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT- THAT CONTINUES TO BE AN AREA THAT WILL NEED MORE TIME TO FOCUS. OKAY WELL I THINK THAT- THAT YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE THE- THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE SOME OF THESE THINGS OUT AND- I APPRECIATE. SHARING PROVIDES SOME PLAYS SOME POINT. WE'VE GOTTA DO SOME PERSUASION TO AND- IT IT AND WHETHER THAT MEANS MORE TIME MORE EDUCATION- IT'S ADDRESS AND IT'S A BIG STATES SO I JUST I ALSO WONDER ABOUT CAPACITY TO. BECAUSE WE CAN PUT SOMETHING ON A WEBSITE SAID WE'VE NOW SHARED IT TO EVERYBODY BUT- I DON'T KNOW THEY'VE READ IT HOW CONVINCING THAT IS. OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE PEOPLE ON MORE ON ONE ON ONE- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN COME TO AGREEMENT IN THE ONE THOUSAND THIRTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE HAVE- TO SAY OKAY WE'RE ALL THAT COMFORTABLE TO REOPEN AND BY THE WAY I ALSO. MENTION THE PARENTS TO THAT THEY HAVE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE TO SEND THEIR KIDS. AS WELL AS WELL AND- JOBS AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE ALSO A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN. AS WELL AND RESOURCES YOU KNOW L. A. L. MENTIONED THAT- AND- WE HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- IS THERE YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO BUILDTHAT CAPACITY IN BOTH. A C. P. H. AS WELL AS THE PART OF EDUCATION TO DO THAT LEVEL OF EDUCATION. THAT'S NECESSARY SO YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM DO WE NEED MORE PEOPLE THAT IS A ON THE TEAM BUT IT AND THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT THAT WE NEED. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT'S WITHOUT AND THAT'S BEYOND JUST THE LOGISTICS. OF LIKE HOW WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP TO DEAL DOING SURVEILLANCE TESTING EVERY WEEK AND- AND SO FORTH SO- SO I THINK- APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS THE ONE LAST THING IS THAT I SOON I DON'T KNOW ARE DEAD THESE WITNESSES FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ARE GOING TO STAY IN THE HEARING SO THAT WE CAN ASK THEM QUESTIONS AND FOLLOW UP AFTER WE HEAR FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT'S INFINITY. YES I BELIEVE THEY'LL BE STAYING FOR THE WHOLE OKAY EXCELLENT SO I'VE MAYBE THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITIES THEN FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS WHEN WE HEAR FROM OTHER PEOPLE THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH MANAGER. THANK YOU CENTER PAN CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER. I WOULD LIKE TO PAY UP. ON OUR QUESTIONS AT CENTER. PAN ASTON WOULD LIKE TO THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE I AM HEARING FROM LOTS OF DISTRICTS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO APPLY IN THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED AND- IN MY HOME COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT ANNOUNCED ON BEHALF OF ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY THEY WILL NOT BE APPLYING FOR LOS ANGELES- PROBABLY THE LARGEST DISTRICT IN THE STATE SAYING THEY'RE NOT APPLYING HER PODCAST. FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FRESNO THAT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE NOT COMPLYING. AND I THINK IN THE PRESENTATION TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IT WAS SAID THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS REQUESTED TO FUND THIS PROGRAM WAS PREDICATED ON TWO THIRDS. OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS APPLYING SO IF MOM. IF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT MARKUPS LINE- ARE YOU GOING TO BE REVISING THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE WILL BE APPLICATIONS FOR WHAT IS PROPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR LAYERED I JUST GOT HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM SUPERINTENDENTS WHO DON'T INTEND TO APPLY WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU- AND- I RECOMMEND THAT THEY REACH OUT TO MYSELF. MISTER ALAN- YOU KNOW TO DISCUSS WHAT THEIR SPECIFIC CONCERNS ARE- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE FOUND THAT IN SPEAKING WITH INDIVIDUAL SUPERINTENDENT TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS THEIR- INDIVIDUAL SITUATION AND HOW THE PROGRAM CAN WORK FOR THEM. WE'VE BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING PEOPLE FEEL LIKE. THAT THE PROGRAM CAN HELP THEM AND SERVE THEM SO I'M PLEASED YOU KNOW PLEASE STAND AND YOUR SUPERINTENDENT OUR WAY WE WERE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSAL WITH THEM AND- THEN WORK WITH THEM ON THEIR PARTICULAR BARRIERS. AND YOUR SECOND QUESTION ON THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS- AND HOW IF IT'S UNDER IF THE PROGRAM IS UNDERSTOOD SCRIBE HOW WE WOULD ADDRESS THAT. THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL THAT SPECIFIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON AN EXPANDED FUND- IN THE PROGRAM BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST THAT THOSE FUNDS IF THERE. AND USED CAN BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION AND REINCORPORATED INTO THE BUDGET SO WE DO HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE. ON TWO TWO SWEET THOSE FUNDS IF THEY'RE AN EXPANDED AND RE ALLOCATE THEM QUICKLY. AND THAT MEANS THAT THEY WOULD BE UNUSED BUT IT WOULD COME IN THE MAY REVISION AND REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. TO RE APPROPRIATE FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE. CORRECT OKAY IN. OUR MAINTAIN A- LIST OR IS THE SOMETHING IN POWER. WERE WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO IS GOING TO APPLY BECAUSE IT. NOT A FORM OF CONTACTED ME. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF I'M GETTING A FAIR READ- BECAUSE I'M ONLY HEARING FROM THOSE THAT ARE NOT COMPLYING AND IT'S A LONG LIST. CERTAINLY SO NO THERE IS NO PUBLIC LIST AND WHERE WE ARE KEEPING TRACK OF WHO IS OR WHO ISN'T APPLYING BUT- IN TERMS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET YOU CONNECTED UP WITH FOLKS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING FOR THE PROGRAM SEVENTY COULD IT IN ANOTHER QUESTION. I DID ASSUME WITH TWENTY- PRESIDENTS OF LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TEACHERS UNIONS IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF MY DISTRICT. AND THERE WASN'T A ONE THAT THOUGHT THEY COULD COMPLETE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OF THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN TIME. FOR THIS APPLICATION PROCESS EVEN IF THE DISTRICT WANTED TO APPLY. IS DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO REFLECT ON THAT ARE THEY WRONG. WHICH IS THE THIRD CERTAINLY WE HAVE- WE HAVE RECEIVED. SIMILAR FEEDBACK THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF SPOKE TO MEET THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT REQUIREMENTS I THINK- IT'S A LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT OUT THERE WHO CURRENTLY HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS- THAT DO ALIGN WITH THEIR SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS- AND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE WITHOUT NEEDING TO RENEGOTIATE CLAPS THAT'S ONE I THINK IMPORTANT THING. TO KEEP IN MIND ARE THEY- ARE THEY IN GENERAL ARE ONES THAT HAVE A HYBRID. A PROBE IF DOCTOR WITH PARTIALLY REOPENED SCHOOLS. SH IT IS NOT SUPER CONSISTENT- BUT YES MANY OF THEM ARE HYBRID MODELS WHICH ARE AND WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF OPEN AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE GRANT. CONSISTENCY THERE I THINK THERE'S A CONCERN THAT'S BEEN EXPRESSED IN PEOPLE THAT HAVE TALKED TO ME. THAT THE HYBRID SCHOOLS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IN MORE AFFLUENT DISTRICTS AND THEREFORE IF THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE EXISTING SAVINGS A SAFETY PLANS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THEY HAVE A LEG UP IN THISPROCESS BEFORE YOU GET TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT BE MORE DISADVANTAGED. SO THAT IS A CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED. BERMAN BE JUST ONE MORE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. COMING OUT OF THE PANEL. THAT RUN SOME OF THE SUBJECTS AND LET ME JUST ASK IT AGAIN I THINK I KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS. BUT WHEN YOU PREPARED THIS PROPOSAL WHEN THERE WAS THE MONEY FOR THE SUPPORTS AND THERE WAS THE MONEY THE TWO BILLION FOR RE-OPENING AND IT'S ROUGH IF I REMEMBER RIGHT AT SIX POINT SIX BILLION TOTAL. AND THEN A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER HERE COMES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION. AND I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU THINK NOT A DOLLAR. FROM THE FEDERAL MONEY WOULD DISPLACE ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR AND STATE MONEY FOR SCHOOL SCHOOL RE OPENING IS THAT CORRECT. SH SAID WE SEE OUR PROPOSAL AS BEING- COMPLEMENTARY TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS. L. AS AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON TITLE ONE NUMBER TITLE ONE STUDENTS BETTER BEING SERVED BY ELEAZAR. OUR PROPOSAL ALLOCATE FUNDS BASED ON TOTAL SELF INTERFACE GRANT CENTURY I'M THAT ADJUSTED FOR LTSS OF METAL CONCENTRATION GRANT FACTORS- SO WE WOULD GET OUR OUR GRANT ENSURES THAT MORE LEDS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING ON A GREATER AMOUNT OF FUNDING- WHERE AS THE TITLE ONE FUNDS. AT THE FEDERAL AFTER FUND AND ALLOCATE ON TITLE ONE- ARE A LITTLE MORE TARGETED AND TO LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO PIECES TOGETHER YOU'RE ENSURING THAT NOT ONLY IS THERE A STRONG EQUITY COMPONENT IN ENSURING THAT THE LOWEST INCOME. AREAS YOU'RE GETTING THE MOST FUNDING BUT ALSO THAT EVERYONE IS GETTING ACCESS TO FUNDS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS FOR THE COST OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THREE ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT HAPPENED LATER IN THE BUDGET A COUPLE. A. WAYS INTO SENATOR MAN. S. ABOUT HIGH RIDGE. FOR AND THE FOR THAT THE PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET DOESN'T BRING IT BACK TO WHERE IT WAS PRETTY PANDEMIC. AND THE ANSWER WAS. WHAT THEY'RE GETTING FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS WILL BRING THEM HIGHER. AND IS THAT A DIFFERENT CASE WHERE WHAT COUNTING THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP PEOPLE IN HIGHER EDUCATION BUT NOT IN K. THROUGH TWELVE BECAUSE- IT'S TIED ONE IN K. THROUGH TWELVE AND THEREFORE. IT'S A DIFFERENT BROUGH BURKE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THE PRINCIPLES THE SAME IT'S JUST THE OPERATION IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO. NO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS OUR- THAT WAS NOT OUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND IN TERMS OF COMPARING THE TWO BECAUSE IN IN. IN PRACTICAL SENSE AND WE'RE NOT HAVING THE SAME EXPECTATIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OF THE ARCADE TWELVE. LOOK SCHOOLS WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR K. TWELVE STUDENTS TO BE BACK IN SCHOOL AND IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND THAT THEY HAVE UNIQUE AND SIGNIFICANT NEED- BEYOND OBVIOUSLY OUR HIGHER EDUCATION TUDENT HAVING IT AS WELL BUT I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO K. TWELVE STUDENTS ARE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT SO IN OUR MIND FOR K. TWELVE IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING BACK. TO WHERE WE WERE IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO SERVE THESE KIDS AN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THESE DOLLARS I APPRECIATE THAT I WAS JUST OPERATE ON THE PREMISE OF THE FEDERAL MONEY DISPLACED ONE AND DIDN'T DISPLACE THE. NO MORE ABOUT TO HEAR PANELISTS THAT ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD CONTEXT FOR THE PANEL SAYS AS THEY PERCENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR INTO OUR PANELISTS AS WELL AND I DO APPRECIATE MEDICARE YOU BRING TOGETHER ALONG WITH THAT YOUR LAYERED AS WELL FOR THE OVERSIGHT HEARING. AMEND CHAIR WOULD LIKE TOJUST TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS- WITH MISS HOLMES ALRIGHT IN JUST WANNA. TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU KNOW WE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE ARE IN AN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING TIME- IN WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO THAT MISS HOMES HAS. SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO GREATLY APPRECIATE HER WORK- AND ALSO THE OF FOUR BILLION pTO THE LEARNING LOSS. MITIGATION IT WAS CRITICAL BUT CANDIDLY MORE STILL NEEDED. VENTURA TAKE THROUGH- A FEW QUESTIONS HERE REAL QUICK- SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON THE TWO BILLION IN THE FOUR FIFTY. PER STUDENT AND HOW THAT WAS LANDED UPON. CERTAINLY AND FIRST IN A REQUIRED THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR KIND WORDS THEY'RE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED- SO IN TERMS OF THE CALCULATION OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER STUDENT- WE- WERE LOOKING AT- AND- IN KEEPING IN MIND THAT. WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING ON A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HALF OF WHAT THE TAKE UP RATE IS GOING TO BE WITHIN THE GRANT I THINK IT'S MISTER LAYARD. MENTIONED EARLIER- WE'RE LOOKING AT WE WERE SENDING A TAKE UP RATE OF ABOUT 70% AND WITHIN THE TWO BILLION- INTO LOOKING AT THAT AND- ASSUMING A BASED GRANT. FOR FIFTY AND THREE THIRTY SEVEN FIFTY RESPECTIVELY FOR THE FEBRUARY FIRST APPLICANTS IN THE MARCH FIRST APPLICANTS. AND THEN- TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT YOU PERHAPS ABOUT HALF WOULD RECEIVE THE FEBRUARY RATE IN ABOUT HALF OF. THE MARCH RATE- WE KIND OF TOOK THE FUNCTIONS TOGETHER WE ALSO LOOK AT- WHAT THAT THE COSTA NEEDS WE'RE GOING TO BE- FOR AND- FOR PROVIDING THAT THE NAME OF THE CARD YOU HEALTH AND SAFETY PURSUANT TO THE MOST RECENT HEALTH. AND SAFETY GUIDANCE THAT WAS RELEASED. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT GIVEN THE FACT THAT MANY ELEAZAR- HAD INVESTED IN DIFFERENT PRIORITIES- PRIOR TO- COMING TO THIS POINT PRIOR TO THE CHANGES IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE SO- MAKING SOME KIND OF RUSSIA'S FUNCTIONS ABOUT THE COST AND THEN ALSO MAKING SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE FACT. THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE PROVIDING IS GENERATED ON A TOTAL PER PUPIL- EIGHTY EIGHT BASIS. TELL HER A FOR ALL. STUDENTS AND A LOOK LIKE YOU. A WITH EXCEPTION OF STUDENTS. STUDY BUT WOULD ONLY BE USED. FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF WHO ARE PROVIDE INCREASED INSTRUCTION KNOWING THAT. THE GENERATION OF THE FUNDS- THE ACTUAL IMPACT PER PUPIL OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WOULD BE HIGHER. THAN THE PER PUPIL AMOUNT PROVIDED AND THEN ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE WAITING IT YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO LCS FASTER AND DUPLICATED STUDENT- THAT THAT WOULD BE. IN PERFECT- YOU KNOW HIGHLY ASSUMPTION BASED. ON METHODOLOGY THAT WE USED IN COMING UP WITH THOSE NUMBERS- AND THE TWO BILLION AND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW WE BUILT THIS WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE BUT- YOU KNOW WE HAD- SOME INDICATION THAT THERE THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES. SO I'M TRYING TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WELL AS THE BRICK BUILDING NEXT TO ENSURE THAT WE WEREN'T- YOU KNOW NOT NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. IN APRIL A DEEP DIVE I THINK THAT THE CONCERN IS IN WOULD LIKE BE TO GET YOU TAKE ON THE AS WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD- AND- SEEN THE CHALLENGES THAT DISTRICTS FACING NINETY WANT TO USE AN EXAMPLE. SO IF WE'RE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE STATE IS PAYING POTENTIALLY FOR TESTING IS THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS TO FIFTY BUCKS FOR TEST. IN FOR PROVIDING A SMALL DISTRICT WHICH IS SAY IT'S A THOUSAND STUDENTS. THAT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY JUST ON TESTING AND ON THE REGIMENT THAT IS- IN THE RE OPENING PLAN- IT IS GOING TO EAT UP THAT FOR FIFTY JUST ON TESTING. SO IT HAS THERE BEEN SOME ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT ON- FIVE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST DISTRICTS I JUST USE THAT ONE EXAMPLE. ON TESTING BECAUSE THE CHEAPEST AND ALL THAT I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE MENDOCINO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SUPERINTENDENT. THE CHIEF IS TODAY BEEN ABLE TO FIND ON THE SALIVA BASED TEST IS BETWEEN EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT AND FIFTY DOLLAR. FIGURE SO IF YOU COULD JUST. COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED IN REGARDS TO WHAT THAT'S GONNA MEAN IN THE REQUIREMENTS. ON DISTRICTS JUST. ON THE TESTING SIDE TO BE ON MAKE IT WORK. ABSOLUTELY AND COMMON ECHO OTHER THAT THAT WE HEARD IT WELL AND- IT. I THAT- I THINK THAT WHEN GENERALLY SPEAKING WHEN- CBO THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS BASICALLY REGARDS TO THE TESTING- I THINK- YOU KNOW I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT COOKER TAKING TO ACCOUNT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO MANY AT THAT THE MODELS THAT. THAT COULD HAVE APPROACHED ME ABOUT- REALLY LOOK AT AND PROVIDING. A TESTING FOR EVERY STAFF AND EVERY STUDENT- KNOCKING NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT- YOU KNOW NOT ALL STUDENTS. AND STAFF ARE GOING TO TEACH YOU TO GO BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BLACK ONE PIECE- OR NOT AFFECTED THE NECESSARY TO GO BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- LEAD YOU KNOW. FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WITH THE BASE GRANT PARK YOU PAUL BUT THAT AMOUNT IS INCREASED- WHEN YOU'RE SERVING AND YOU LOOK AT IT. STUDENT THE STUDENT TO OUR LOW INCOME ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE- UP TO AROUND THE SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR CRISTINA RANGE DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW THIS DIDN'T GENERATE SUPPLEMENTAL. AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS- AGREE. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WITH THE PIECE OF THAT THAT WE CAN BE HIGHER AND THEN- EMPHATICALLY GO AHEAD NOT TO HEAR THAT BUT I GUESS IT CAN AYE AYE. SO IF IS SEGMENTED BURN THIS IS. HOW OF THE POT. IS DOING. THOUSANDS TO. FIVE TOTAL STAFF AND STUDENTS ARE TESTED WE- THAT'S A BURN RATING. THAT A WEEK. IN ESPECIALLY SMALL DO. THAT ARE IN. SOME TYPE OF AND POOL SANDRA. DADDY'S GOING TO BE A C. CHAO TO BE ABLE TO MEET. OUR IN THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS IS CURRENTLY INDICTED WITH THE RE OPENING PLAN SO HAS THERE BEEN SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHT AFTER HEARING FEEDBACK FROM SCHOOL LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE THAT THERE MAY NEED TO BE. A SECOND THOUGHT ON FOR EXAMPLE THE TESTING. AND THE ONE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD MENTION- IS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE- WE ARE SEEKING A WAY A MEDIC HOW LABOR TO ALLOW SCHOOLS. TO YOU KNOW PAY FOR MUCH OF THEIR STUDENT TESTING DRAMATIC HOW FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE THAT'S JUST ANOTHER PIECE IN ALL OF THIS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS PUBLIC AND PEOPLE UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE FUNDING FOR THIS GRANT- IN ADDITION TO FUNDING- THAT. LEADS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE THROUGH THE FEDERAL AND ESTHER FUND. WE FEEL LIKE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES- AND SUFFICIENT. RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED TO PROP UP. A HEALTH AND- STRUCTURE THAT IS THAT SIMILAR TO AS OUTLINED IN OUR GUIDANCE- IN TERMS OF THE TESTING ITSELF YOU RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR YOUR YOUR YOU'RE SPOT ON WITH YOUR THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY DOLLARS THAT IS THAT IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO BE THAT THE RATE FOR TESTING BUT- WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE. FOOLING TESTING- TO TRY TO BRING DOWN THE COST YEAH EVEN MORE SO- SO WE ARE WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT CASTING CAN BE- DONE AS AS EASILY AND AS INEXPENSIVELY AS POSSIBLE I'M ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT FOLKS HAVE APPROACHED ME ABOUT IS THE COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE. RELATED TO YOU I'M PUTTING A TESTING SITES ON THEIR SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT TEST TEST CAN BE TAKEN HOME- AND ENDED MINISTERED AT HOME AND THEN BROUGHT BACK SO. WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT THE TESTING COMPONENT IS NOT THE BIGGEST BARRIER IN ALL OF THIS AND THAT IT MADE AS- AN EXTENSION AND EXPANSION OF POSSIBLE FOR SCHOOL AND- TEN MANAGER ONNA KEEP MOVING HERE I THINK MY- MY CONCERN AT THIS POINT IS WILL MEDICARE NOW. THAT BILLION REIMBURSEMENT BE UP AND RUNNING BY FEBRUARY FIRST SO- IT'S NOT I TRIED TO TRUST BUT VERIFY BY THE DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO TRUST US TO BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE IN THE SECOND PIECE IS- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PULLING TESTING I JUST DON'T HAVE A FALSE START I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT TO HAVE A FALSE START WE DON'T WANT TO OVER PROMISE AND UNDER DELIVER END ACROSS THIS NATION WE SEE THAT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND- TERRENCE THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS A FALSE START. SO MANY PARENTS WANT TO GET THEIR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL TEACHERS WANT TO REMAIN SAFE TO BE TO KEEP THEIR FAMILY SAFE AND IF WE DON'T HAVE TESTING UP AND RUNNING AS IS REQUIRED THEN I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT IT WILL BE A FALSE START AND I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE AND I KNOW THAT CAN YEAH DISCUSSIONS ARE GONNA CONTINUE. MANAGER VERY QUICKLY- ON THE REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS TO- IN- REAL OPENING PLAN WHEN IT. TO IN TO CONNECT. SO I. IS DISTRICTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO SEARCH THAT EACH OF THIS. IT'S BEEN A DISTANCE LEARNING HAVE TO CONVENE A COMPUTING DEVICE SOFTWARE AND HIGH SPEED INTERNET THAT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW. SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT RURAL CALIFORNIA AND ESPECIALLY HELLO EASE HUMBLED DOWN OR COUNTY TRINITY COUNTY. STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET IN FACT THE FIRST OF ITS KIND PLAN WITH A SATELLITE PROVIDER- WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO SIGN UP HUNDRED ADDITIONAL STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE TAG. SO IF THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT DISTRICTS ARE GONNA TO CERTIFY THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO CERTIFY. YES I AM I'M NOT SURE IF THAT QUESTION WAS DIRECTED AT ME BUT I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S A IT'S A COMMON IN ITS THE TRUTH I MEAN FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DISTRICTS THAT ARE STILL DOING. PACKET PICK UPS BECAUSE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS. YOU CAN'T GET A HOT SPOT. YOU CAN'T GET A SIGNAL FOR WIFI IN YOUR HOME. IN MOST ARE LOW INCOME SO I JUST THAT REQUIREMENT IN THERE THAT DISTRICTS GRANT TO CERTIFY INTO THIS DEPENDENT ON THAT CERTIFICATION DEPENDING ON RE OPENING THIS IS MORE OF A COMMENT- THEY'RE JUST NEVER GOING TO BE A MEET THAT HURDLE. SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME AYE I'M- THOUGHT OF A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH- I THINK EVERY DISTRICT HAS BEEN TRYING LIKE HELL TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE. IT'S JUST AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. RULE REMOTE AND CANDIDLY. FOR KIDS AND- THE IT'S- THIS. PANDEMIC IS ONLY MADE THE CRISIS MORE CUTE. ON THAT QUICKLY I'M GONNA GO TO THE NEXT. ON THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT DISTRICTS ARE PUTTING ALL THEIR APPLES INTO ONE BASKET I'M SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BASE OUR RE OPENING AND WILL USE ON VACCINATIONS IN BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES BOTH NATIONALLY AS WELL AS HERE IN THE STATE. ON THERE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HIT THOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THERE AND- YOU- SO I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE THIS PATCHWORK ACROSS THE STATE OF SOME- DISTRICTS OPENING UP BASED OFF OF WEALTH SOME DISTRICTS OPENING UP THAT HAVE- HIGHER VACCINATION REGIMEN THAT'S FOCUSED. ON AND IF WE LOOK AT THE CHANGING VACCINATIONS- DEPLOYMENT BASED OFF OF THE NUMBER OF VACCINATIONS AVAILABLE THERE'S DISTRICTS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND WILL USE IT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO OPEN IF IT'S ALL BASED OFF OF GETTING THEIR STAFF VACCINATED. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND COMING HERE NEXT I THINK THAT IS A GROWING FIRE CANDIDLY. THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FACE. I ITEMS HOMES IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. AS CERTAINLY I THINK PERHAPS AND MY COLLEAGUE MISTER ALLEN MIGHT AND BE ABLE TO SPEAK A LITTLE MORE- ELOQUENTLY TO THAT TO THAT QUESTION SURE THANK YOU. YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK OR WHAT BECOMES CRITICALLY IMPORTANT YOUR POINT CENTER IS THAT. AS WE LOOK AT THE CHALLENGES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON HIS PLACE FUNDS IN TERMS OF SUPPLY. FOLLOWING BACK SEEN. IT UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO REALLY CONTINUE HAVE SUCH AS THE ALL THE MITIGATION. MEASURES THAT WORKS ARE PART OF THE STATE SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLAN CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL. TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM ASKING TO DISTANCING- TO WEAR APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW USING THE SURVEILLANCE TESTING. ALL THOSE MEANS EVEN WITH VACCINES- WILL HAVE TO BE PART OF THE EQUATION- WELL WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT AND GET THE SUPPLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS STEP. UP AND BE A PART OF A PLEA. I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITHOUT CAN TALK MASK NOW WE WANT THERE ARE DAYS. HUNDRED TODAY ARE THE STATE RIGHT NOW BASED THEIR MO OPEN PLANTS WITH THEIR BARGAINING UNITS BASED OFF OF VACCINATIONS. SO I AM THAT. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY SO IF WE'RE BASIN AND IN PLEASE YOU KNOW BETTER THAN AYE YALL- IN REGARDS TO HAVING COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE AT I'M COMMUNITY. BUT YOU TALK TO CERTIFICATED CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. ADMINISTRATORS THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO NAIL IT THERE ARE OTHER COUNTIES ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET CLOSE. SO I JUST I WORRY ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER FRANKLIN I'M NOT TRYING TO THROW STONES IT IS FOR JUST BEING PRACTICAL. I'M VERY CONCERNED IN REGARD TO IT FOR BASING. ALL OF OUR RE OPENING PLANS OFFER VACCINATIONS SHOULD WE ALSO BE LOOKING AT READ AND HAVING AN EITHER OR WHATEVER- BASED OFF OF INFECTIONS FOR HUNDRED PEOPLE. ORG IN THE PURPLE AND GETTING EVERYONE VACCINATED MIGHT MY LAST PIECE. WILL BE- ON. CDPH A- I WANT TO SAY DOCTOR GOLLY IS THE BEST AND SO GRATEFUL. WE HAD A- A CALL AS SOON WITH FIFTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND MENDOCINO AND HUMBOLDT COUNTIES. CDPH DIDN'T HAVE THE BANDWIDTH TO BE ABLE TO JOIN THE ZOOM. I TO BE A TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE- I ONLY SAY THAT IS THIS IS NOT THROWN A STONE AS HE PH BECAUSE THEY'RE INCREDIBLY BUSY. BUT I JUST WORRY IF WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE VERY CLEAR GUIDANCE BEFORE WE GO BACK IN BECAUSE I AGAIN I FALL START- IS JUST GONNA ROYAL THE PUBLIC- EVEN MORE THAN ENOUGH FOLKS ALREADY ARE AND ESPECIALLY PARENTS AND I SAY THAT PERSONALLY BECAUSE- MY WIFE IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND- OBVIOUSLY TEACHERS CLASS FIND PARENTS ARE FACING INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES. THANK YOU SO MUCH VENTURE I APOLOGIZE WE'RE GOING SO LONG AND I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. TO MR- IS HOMES AS WELL AS MR ALLEN. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE WE'RE GOING TO GO REMOTELY NOW. TO SENATOR GLAZERS SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU AT YOUR LEYVA THANK YOU DID YOUR COMMITTEE BOTH COMMITTEES FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR AN IMPORTANT. CONVERSATION THE MAJESTIC KNOWLEDGE NOT CHALLENGING IT HAS BEEN FOR OUR ENTIRE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. YEAH WE ALL CARE. ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IRAQ UNHAPPY- AND EVERYBODY'S WORKING VERY HARD AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE. ALL THOSE EFFORTS. AND CERTAINLY I SURE THE GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR TO GET. KIDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM WITH A- WITH THAT TYPE OF UP MUCH MORE VALUED- INSTRUCTION. I SURE CENTER REQUIRES CONCERNS ABOUT TESTING. THE COST OF TESTING AND HOW THAT REALLY PRACTICALLY IT CAN REALLY HAPPEN. AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN I THINK HE'S A GOOD JOB OF LAYING THAT ISSUE OUT. I DO WANT TO BRING UP ANOTHER- ISSUE- REGARDING THE ON SITE INSTRUCTION. CRITERIA. FOR THE GRANT MONEY. THERE ARE NONE CLASS BAY. SCHOOL THAT- SERVE HIGH- AT RISK STUDENTS- EDIBLE. IN CLASSROOM AS WELL AS AN ONLINE MODEL. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE- CRITERIA THAT THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ESTABLISHED WOULD PREVENT. ANY OF THOSE. HYBRID PROGRAMS FROM BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THESE GRANTS SO I'D LIKE TO ASK. I GUESS THE REP FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAYBE TO SPEAK TO THAT. CERTAINLY THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER SO- WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW TO ALLOCATE FUNDS ONE THING THAT WE CONSIDERED WAS- YOU KNOW WHICH- WHICH ELEAZAR HAS FAMILIES LOST THEIR CHOICE ESSENTIALLY AN IN PERSON OR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY FAMILY TO OUR TO THE NON CLASSROOM BASED MODEL ARE CHOOSING- LEN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THAT THAT THEY'RE CHOOSING TO FORGO AND IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND WHILE I RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ALSO HAD IN PERSON COMPONENTS. AND THEY WERE CERTAINLY ABLE THEY ALREADY HAD THE- PROGRAMS AND- FOR JUSTIN LEARNING AND A FAMILY TO ME TO TRY REALLY PARTIALLY TO. LEARNING I'M PRIOR DEPEND. WE DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT WHEN WE WERE KINGS ALLOCATION THE TWO BILLION IT THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION HOWEVER IS THAT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT IN. THE IS THE SETTING- THAT THERE COULD BE LEARNING LOST OR OR LOSS OF SERVICES- RELATED TO GOING TO A FULL DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL AS OPPOSED TO A HYBRIDISED INCURRING MODEL WHICH MANY ATTENDEES. AS YOU MENTIONED SH- AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE INCLUDED THEM AND AS BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IN EXTENDED LEARNING TIME ACADEMIC INTERVENTIONS GRANT SHE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ALSO ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PLAN. AND TO ADDRESS ANY GAPS THEIR STUDENTS HADN'T SERVICES AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. THAT WE REALLY BOUNCED AS THOSE PRIORITIES AND CONCERNS AND LOOKING AT BOTH. OF THOSE WHAT THE FUNDING. WHAT THANK THANK YOU FOR THE EXPO- IT JUST SEEMS THAT IF THE IF GOAL. A TO. PROVIDE GRANTS ON AND IF. YOU HAVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE PERFECT GOING TO. THAT THEY'RE GONNA MEET THAT- THEY SHOULD BE DISCRIMINATED. JUST BE THEY'VE- THIS SO CALLED NOT CLASS FROM. MODELS IF THEY'RE PROVIDING THAT INSTRUCTION IN THE CLASSROOM IT SEEMS LIKE YOU SHOULD BE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD AND REWARD THAT EFFORT. AND THE COST THAT THAT GO INTO PROVIDING FOR THAT. THAT BENEFIT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I'M SURE. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER CORTESE. THANK YOU- FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THAT- EIGHT WITHOUT THE TRYING TO MAKE A LOT OF- REDUNDANT COMMENTS I JUST WANT TO SAYS SO SHE- OF MOST ABOUT I WOULD SAY WITH WHAT I'VE HEARD THUS FAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES HERE- AMADEUS. IT STRIKES ME THAT THERE'S- A SEQUENCING ISSUE HERE THAT IT JUST JUST SEEMS LIKE IT. I THOUGHT THROUGH IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF THE PLAN AND WHEN THEY SAY THAT- I I'M CERTAINLY A BELIEVER IN IN PLANNING IN. YOU KNOW BY BACKING INTO A CRITICAL PATH PUTTING THE DATA OUT THERE AND SAYING HERE'S WHAT WE NEED TO. TO DO. A TO ACCOMPLISH DELIVERY ON THAT DATE OR AT THAT THE- I DON'T THINK THAT'S WITH THIS IS STILL BASED ON. HOW IT'S BEEN EXPLAINED TO US. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A DATE THE STARBURST. A F. CUT WHICH- JOINT. SOMEBODY MISTER ALAN I THINK YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR SHOP IF YOU WILL- MAY BE RECOMMENDING THAT THE BUT THERE'S A DATE THAT'S UP WANTING TO BE OUT THERE AS THIS IS THE DAY WE WANT TO TELL THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS CAN RE OPEN. BUT. YOU KNOW A MUCH OF WHAT'S BEEN SAID HERE TODAY IS NO SECRET- TO ANYONE INCLUDING THOSE WHO PARTY PRESENTED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. HAVE THE IN SERVICING OF TEACHERS BUILT INTO THEM AND THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBEROF IN SERVICING DAYS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES. SO WHY WOULD WE CREATE LOAD WE SET UP A DATE AND AGAIN I DON'T MEAN TO BE CRITICAL BUT I'M TRYING TO USE LEARNED LIVED EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST. ELEVEN MONTHS WHY WOULD WE DO ANYTHING WITH REGARD TO COALBED BY SETTING UP A DATE- WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE CRITICAL PATH THAT WE KNOW EXISTS ON THE CRITICAL PATH IN THIS CASE WOULD BE. PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY HAVE TO GO BACK IT'S IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE. WHETHER THEY'RE THEIR UNIONS- ARE ARE BEING OBSTRUCTIONISTS OR ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF THE TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S GONNA NEED TO BE NECESSARY TO OPEN THOSE DOORS UP. THEIR CONTRACTS. HISTORICALLY AND ALWAYS IS FAR AS I KNOW WILL HAVE. AN IN SERVICE DATES THAT ARE SET UP AND ESTABLISH AHEAD OF TIME FOR VARIOUS DISCIPLINES KNOWN ANTICIPATED THIS- SO THERE IS NO ONE. KNOWS CONTRACTS ARE GONNA ARE GOING TO. SCRIBE BUT IN SERVICE TRAINING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES. FOR THIS. SO WE KNOW THAT. SO WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO INVEST IN IT AND BY THE WAY AS WE ALL KNOW IT TAKES MONEY TO DO THOSE IN SERVICE DATE SO WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE. TO START OFF Y SAYING OUR FIRST INVESTMENT WE REALLY WANT TO GET SCHOOLS OPEN WE ALL AGREED THAT AND HEARD ANYONE SAY WE DON'T WANT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT IT. WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO SAY OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. NEEDS TO BE TO GO. FUND THAT THE IN SERVICING THE INSERVICE TRAINING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IT CAN THAT. I THINK WE CAN SET A DATE THAT'S REASONABLE FOR WHEN THAT SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN SOON. MS ALL SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO SLOW TO GO FAST BUT I'M NOT SUGGESTING WE GO SLOW WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OBVIOUS PLEASE IT'S NOT AS IF WE HAVE. I'M A- YOU KNOW SOME LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS OUT THERE THAT DON'T HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT. SO WOULDN'T WE JUST ATTACKED THAT. FIRST AND THEN SOMEONE CAN BEGIN WITHOUT BEING REDUNDANT BECAUSE I SAID I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IF YOU TAKE. THE PUBLIC RELATIONS ISSUE IF YOU TAKE THE CALL CENTER ISSUE THERE'S GOING TO BE. THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF CALLS COMING INTO THE SCHOOLS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT ARE YOU CLIP WITH MAYBE ONE ATTENDED SECRETARY. AND ONE TRUANT OFFICER. THE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS MY COULD SUPPOSED TO BE IN SCHOOL OR NOT- SO WHAT MAKES SENSE. TO INVEST IN IN THAT PIECE FIRST AND AGAIN PARDON ME IF THAT EXIST THERE SOME. HOTLINE AT HELLO YOU KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT IS GOING TO BUILD THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ANSWER THOSE CALLS ON BY WAY OF- EXAMPLE HAVING BEEN A COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN. ONE OF THE LARGEST COUNTIES IN THE STATE TOWARDS CUTTING THE BAY AREA. WHICH WAS AN ORIGINAL HOT SPOT I JUST CAME FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. OF HAVING TO HANDLE IN MY OWN OFFICE. AS DID FOR OTHER COUNTY SUPERVISED ABOUT TEN THOUSAND. EMAILS AND-PHONE CALLS PER MONTH MOST OF WHICH WERE NOT DIRECTLY IN OUR DAILY WORK AND HAD TO BE REFERRED OUT ELSEWHERE. THAT'S WITH TEN STAFF DEVOTED TO CONSTITUENT RESPONSE HOW DOES THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DO THAT HOW DOES THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO THAT CERTAINLY THEY'RE GONNA GET THOSE CALLS OR IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY. AND SOMEHOW HANDLE THOSE CALLS. FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO. MY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS DOES ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY. SENATOR PENN SENATOR LAYERED CENTER MCGUIRE THIS FORMS CONVERSATION AS TO THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE. IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO BACK AND BUILD THAT SEQUENCE AND THEN SEE WORK WHERE THE DAY. WHAT DATE WE CAN LAND ON IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY GETTING THE WORK DONE. AND I THINK THAT QUESTIONS HONEST ROMAN BUT THE HOME PART OF IT MAY BE FOR FINANCE OF THE SERVER GRAYSON COOKE A BURNING ISSUE SIR. SO AND WELCOME TO IF I KNOW IF YOU DON'T. SENATOR I LIKE TO TAKE A FIRST STEP BACK. AND CERTAINLY AND MISTER ALAN CAN. ADAM I'M I CAN'T SPEAK. TO HOW- SO THAT YOU CAN HANDLE- THAT THE MANY THAT COMMUNICATION THAT THEY RECEIVED FROM. FROM COMMUNITIES OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE- THANK DISTRICT ADMIN. WHO ARE ON THE NEXT PANEL. I WOULD DEFINITELY DEFERRED TO THEM ABOUT HOW THEY'RE HANDLING MATCH. BUT YOUR LARGER QUESTION ABOUT ABOUT BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST PRIOR KIT COMMITTING TOWARDS RE. OPENING AND IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION- AND WE- THEN WE HAVE BEEN. IN INTO TO BILL OUT THE- AND YOU KNOW TO BE FAIR TO EVERYONE ON IT HASN'T BEEN A PERFECT PROCESS BECAUSE AS AS YOU WELL KNOW THE SITUATION AT IN CHANGING IT'S BEEN VERY FLUID AND ALL BEEN TRYING TO KEEP. KEEP UP WITH BUT THE CHANGING. ENVIRONMENT BUT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACTUALLY PROVIDED THE COMPLAINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO SCHOOL DON'T YOUR TOTAL FEDERAL AFTER FUN- AS WELL AS LEARNING LAST MEDICATION FUNDS TO ADDRESS STUDENT NEEDS- AND- HELP. HIM AT THE ACT THAT WERE. RIGHT NOW- TO HELP SCHOOL YOU KNOW PLAN ANY JUST Q. THE COMPANY TEN. ANY DISTANCE LEARNING THAT ALLOW OF. BOOKS FOR. AND AS WELL AS- KEY IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BECAUSE- WE ALSO PROVIDED AND- DELIVERIES. AS HE- SO THAT DISTRICTS ACCESS RIGHT AWAY THE BEGINNING THE LAST YEAR. I'M IN OF THESE ISSUES AROUND CASTING. A PARTY. YOU KNOW WHAT WE TALK TO THE LARGEST DISTRICT- AND WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE BLANKS. THEY HELENS WE DON'T NEED THAT WE ALREADY OUR TEST YOU KNOW I TESTING. UNPLANNED AND AN AGREEMENT IN PLACE AND THAT WE NEED THE WHOLE A LOT WE KNOW THE IF RUSSIA A LARGER. MANY OF THE AND- ALREADY IN PLACE. IN ADDITION REGARD TO VALENCIA LAB UNDER PART IN A PUBLIC IS ALREADY SET UP A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR. AND PILOTS ON CAMP. I'M GONNA BE MENTORED THE LUNCH THE A LOT. I JUST I MENTION ALL OF THE- TICKLER. THAT HAS. BEEN A GOOD DEAL. OF IN. BILL IMPROPER. FOR COMING BY AND PER AND- UNTIL I KNOW THAT THAT I CAN GIVE IT HIGH. AND TO WRECK. IN TURN OF. YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE TIME LINES AND OR NOT RELIGION. ARBIT DEFINITELY NOT AND YOU KNOW WE'VE WE BEEN THING ABOUT WE CAN THAT HOW WE CAN GET AND PER INSTRUCTION CLASS MARCH- AND WE UNDERSTAND BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS AND CERTAINLY ONE THING THAT'S WONDERFUL ABOUT THE K. TWELVE SCHOOL COMMUNITY IS THEY'RE NOT QUIET ABOUT- THEIR CONCERNS AND THAT THE ISSUES AND BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE NOT A GOOD THING BECAUSE- THEY MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW IT. AS WELL AS THE BUILDING TOWARDS OUR PROPOSAL. WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE THAT THE FEBRUARY FIRST AND MARCH FIRST DATE AND THEN THE SORT OF THE- THE- THE ROLLING EVERY OPENING FOR HIGHER TRANSMISSION AND- AND DISTRICT AND ONLY EIGHT. CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE HAD IN MIND WHEN WE BUILT THIS PROGRAM OUT. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO BALANCE THAT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY WE HAVE AROUND GETTING KIDS BACK INTO THE INTO THE QUESTION A QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THIS SCHOOL YEAR. IS ENDING QUICKLY AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WORKING IN THIS SPACE AND LAST MARCH- AND HAS HAD BEEN THERE SINCE WE WERE THINKING YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY GONNA LAST A COUPLE WEEKS AND INSTEAD THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK- THE SCHOOL YEAR GOES BY VERY QUICKLY. AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT- YOU FINISH THE SCHOOL YEAR INDISCIPLINE BURNING AND THEN HE STARTED ANOTHER SCHOOL YEAR AND DISTANCE LEARNING. AND THEN YOU FINISH THE FIRST SEMESTER AND- LEARNING AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE REALLY REALLY TRYING HARD TO DO IS TO TELL THE JUDGE MUCH OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AS WE POSSIBLY CAN KNOWING THAT WE ARE ALREADY IN JANUARY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE PLANS IN PLACE TO OPEN OKAY BYE. APRIL VERY UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL OPEN. AT ALL. FOR THE REST OF THE SCHOOL YEAR- AND THAT WE JUST. IF WE ARE IN JUST LEARNING AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHICH THAT MEAN FOR NEXT SCHOOL YEAR AND THAT IS THE- GOOD. HEARING THAT WE HAVE. SO IN TERMS OF I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT YOU YOU WONDER. THAT THIS IS THAT IS NOT OUR. ISRAEL HAS HAD A LOT OF. GOING INTO IT. AND THEN I WILL TURN OVER TO THE- ALLEN. FURTHER IN. THE QUESTION. AT MISS HOLMES GOT. TH MAJORITY OF WHAT I WOULD SHARE AYE ONLY JUST. TACK ON THE- IT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE DATES THE ARE MADE. RIGHT THIS ISN'T THE HAVE TO BY THIS THIS IS WITH TO HELP FOR. A MEMBERS STRUCTURE GRANT IN HIS MID HOLMES NO. ON THAT WILL MOVE IN TERMS OF DEPENDING ON THE CASE RATE IN COUNTY LOCAL HEALTH FIRST OF. BUT WHEN YOU'RE A TO BRING THE BACK AND WAS JUST LIKE OUTSIDE THIS IS REALLY ON BOTH. A SUPPORTING THOSE WHO- OPEN TO ENSURE THAT CAN BE TO OPENED SO. PROVIDING THE PRODUCTIONS. THEIR AND STAFF IN STUDENTS I AS WELL AS AND IN WAITING REALLY. ON VERY INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO BUILD I THINK IN THE WAY THAT YOU HIGHLIGHT SENATOR A VERY. UP THOUGHTFUL- PHASED IN APPROACH THAT FOLKS ON. BACK THIS TO IN THE EARLY IS GREAT WERE THOSE ARE NOT YET OPEN. WHEN YOU'RE UNDER THOSE CASE REYES ARE PUBLIC EXPERTS HAVE TOLD IS RIGHT. TO LOOK AT. AND TO. THAT MOMENTUM. A WITH THOSE EARLIEST BASED ON THE SIZE ABOUT- THERE ABILITY- TO TRANSMIT AND THE FACT THAT SLOWER. I AS WELL AS INSTANT A PRIORITY IN TERMS OF THE LEARNING NEEDS I IN THOSE EARLY AS GRADES AND WITH OUR MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT STUDENTS. AND SO THE GRANT IS STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT REALLY EMPHASIZES THEIR NEEDS AND MEETING THEM AND THEN BUILDING THAT UP IN A PHASE WAY. ON DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE. IN YOUR CASE RAISING YOUR COUNTY. I HAD TAKEN THAT FORWARD SO BUILDING ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT I'M IS HOMES HIGHLIGHTED IT'S BEEN. A BUILT IN FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED SINCE LAST. LAST MARCH AND LAST BUDGET- THIS IS REALLY QUITE INTENTIONAL AND THE DATES ARE A SIMPLE WAY OF. PROVIDING THAT THE URGENCY FOR THAT PHASE IN PROCESS. OF THE MISS HOLMES IOWA. IT YOUR BY YOU SAY. BUT THEN AGAIN I WANT TO CLARIFY I'M COME FROM ON SIDE OF IT IS I IT'S NOT A MAY- I THINK MORE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE. I TO VIRTUALLY HERE UNDERSTAND ALL THE FACTS AND WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS WORK I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. IN THE LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR EIGHT YEARS- I GET IT. BUT WHAT. THE PUBLIC DOESN'T UNDERSTAND AND THIS GOES BACK TO SOME COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES HERE REGARDING. THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS I CAN MENTION THAT TO. HIS THEY HEAR THAT SCHOOLS CAN OPEN NOW. AND IN IN ORDER TO HANDLE THE RESPONSE TO ALL THE CLASSROOMS SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE OPEN THERE NEEDS TO BE CAPACITY BUILT FOR THAT- IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY WE CREATED SOMETHING HERE. AT CENTRAL COMMAND THAT'S NOT MANDATORY. BUT WE JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW. THAT YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN OPEN UP IF THEY WANT TO. OR IF THEY'RE READY. WITHOUT BUILDING THE CAPACITY TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT COME ALONG WITH IT NOW I THINK HONESTLY AND I DON'T MEAN THIS TO BE FACETIOUS AT ALL BUT IF THE ROLLOUT OF THIS GRANT PROGRAM WANTS TO SAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DISCLOSED THAT'S BEEN DISCLOSED TO US TODAY AS AS A AS A FOOTNOTE AS A AS A FULL LAUNCH RAMPS MATTER FOR TRANSPARENCY. YES YOUR SCHOOL THIS IS CAN OPEN UP NOW BUT ONLY IF THEY'VE SET. BUT ONLY IF THE CERTIFIED THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. REQUIREMENTS I'M OLY IF THEY PROPERLY IN SERVICE AND TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES. I'M ONLY IF THEY'VE BEEN APPROVED FOR THE GRANT MAY HAVE BEEN A FUNDING- ONLY THERE'S ONLY THERE'S ONLY THERE'S ONLY THIS AND ONLY THIS AND- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC YOU HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND. THE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE OPENING I MEAN IT'S ALMOST BURYING THE LEAD TO DO IT ANY OTHER WAY. RENDON C. SCHOOLS CANNELLA OPEN THE FALCONERS WERE REALLY SEEN AS MOST SCHOOLS WON'T OPEN. BUT WE WANT YOU TO KNOW WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR THE FEW THAT ARE ABLE TO MEET THESE GUIDELINES THAT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT PUBLIC RELATIONS STATEMENT AND FRANKLY I DON'T WANT TO BE PUT IN A POSITION. AS A MEMBER A NEW MEMBER THE STATE SENATE. TO BE TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHY WE ROLLED OUT A PROGRAM. THAT IS GOING TO THE VERY NOBLE THING THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. OPENING UP CLASSROOMS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO KIDS DON'T GET. FURTHER BEHIND. ONLY ONLY TO HAVE WHAT HAPPENS ON THE GROUND. COME BACK THROUGH CONSTITUENT CASELOAD IN MY OFFICE THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS IN MY DISTRICT. IN SAN JOSE THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND CITY CENTERS IN FOURTEEN OTHER CITIES THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS FROM THIRTY DIFFERENT DISTRICTS TRYING TO ANSWER. THE QUESTION. WELL IF. IF THE STATE SAYS THIS CAN HAPPEN BEEN HAWKING IT'S NOT HAPPENING. IT CAN ONLY ASKING ON THAT PIECES WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO BUILD THE CAPACITY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND KIDS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY ALONE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS IN THE REST OF STATE. IN AND I'M NOT HEARING THAT ANSWER BUT I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING IS. THE LOCALS WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. YOU KNOW WE'VE- WE'VE WE'VE WORKED ON THIS FOR A YEAR AND THEY KNOW THIS IS COMING THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF IT I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE I KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY CARE OF IT. SO WHERE WERE WORD IS THAT. WHAT WHAT HAPPENS THEN IT IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A KICK OF COMMUNICATIONS TRAIN WRECK TO ME IF WE DON'T IT LEAST TAKE CARE OF THAT PIECE SO- I KNOW IT WAS A COMMENT REGISTER- WANT TO GET THAT OUT THERE. THANK YOU AND I WOULD LOOK FOR TO ANY KIND OF CONSTRUCTIVE. OUR POLICY RESPONSE WOULD BE THAT'S COMING FROM THE LEGISLATURE THIS COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW FOR THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR MEMBERS WHO HAD QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I WANT TO WRAP UP WITH A COUPLE QUESTIONS MYSELF. I WANT TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON SOMETHING SENATOR LAYERED PRODUCT- JUST A THIS WOULD BE FOR YOU MS HOMES WHICH AND HOW MANY ELEAZAR TOLD THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY WILL APPLY FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS. I THINK WE NIBBLED AROUND THE EDGES BUT I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE AN IDEA OF WHO'S GOING TO USE AND HOW MANY. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION I'D HAVE TO GO BACK WITH MY COLLEAGUES WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIND OUT WHO THEY'VE BEEN TALKING TO BUT I CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT INFORMATION. OKAY BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANYONE- IN MY DISTRICT AND SURROUNDING DISTRICTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE GUIDELINES. AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MONEY SO I'M JUST. JUST I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A SCHOOL DISTRICT OUT THERE. THAT WANT THAT THINKS THIS PLANET IS WORKABLE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT FOUND ONE- AND CONSIDERING THAT THE VERY FEW L. ET. IT LIAISE- TO BE. IN ON INTERESTED IN PURSUING THESE GRANTS- AND TIMING IS A MAJOR MAJOR OBSTACLE. WHY IS IT MINISTRATION HOLDING FIRM TO THE ACCELERATED TIMELINE LINES. CERTAINLY SO AGAIN AND WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FEBRUARY FIRST ST AND THEN THE MARCH FIRST ST AND WE THINKTHAT YOU KNOW FOR ITS FIRST GOLD WHO ARE MORE PREPARED- WHO ARE MOSTLY ALL THE WAY THERE ARE PERHAPS ALREADY OPEN- BACK HAVE YOU WORRY FIRST DATE- OBVIOUSLY- IT IS IT'S REACHABLE ARE ATTAINABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE YOU KNOW VERY CLOSE TO THAT TO THE ONLINE ALREADY- IN TERMS OF THE MARCH FIRST DATE THAT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE DISTRICTS WERE NOT CURRENTLY READY ADDITIONAL TIME TO MEET THE- MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN AND THEN HERE TO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT WHY THEY'RE STILL XCELERATED AGAIN I THINK I WOULD JUST REFER BACK TO MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS AROUND. TRYING TO SALVAGE AS MUCH OF THE SCHOOL YEARS AND POSSIBLY CAN. NO ONE DISAGREES WITH THAT WE ALL WANT OUR KIDS BACK LEARNING MY CONCERN IS THERE ARE SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPEN WHICH DO WE HAVE A LIST OF WHICH SCHOOLS ARE ACTUALLY OPEN AND- AND- DOING INSTEAD AND PERSON INSTRUCTION. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. NO WE DO NOT HAVE OR I'M SORRY GO AHEAD JOHN. I WAS ON SITE- ONLY DO. SO I WAS JUST GONNA RECORD. THAT ONE OF THE DIRECT THE CAME OUT THURSDAY ON THAT WE WILL HAVE THAT INFORMATION STARTING WITH FOLKS REPORTING NEXT MONTH UP SENATE THAT DIRECTIVE ON BECAUSE THAT IS A QUESTION THAT WE KNOW IS THAT A VERY MUCH OF INTEREST YOURSELF AS WELL AS US. SO WE MADE THIS PLAN NOT KNOWING WHAT SCHOOLS ALREADY OPEN. OKAY SO MY OTHER QUESTION IS ABOUT VACCINES I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON HOW WE WOULD GET TEACHERS AND STAFF VACCINATED FOR IN PERSON LEARNING HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK. A DIFFICULT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WOULD WANT TO DEFER TO SOME OF MY PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEAGUES WHO ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY ON THAT QUESTION. AND WE CAN CETAINLY RELATE THAT QUESTION TO THEM AND HAVE THEM CONTACT YOUR STAFF. SO IF IT'S NOT BUT IF IT'S NOT IN THE PLAN DOES THAT MEAN THERE IS NO PLAN TO VACCINATE TEACHERS AND STAFF. RIGHT I JUST DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING IN- SAY SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLAN REGARDING VACCINES- THE PLAN DOES NOT INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT AROUND VACCINES- IT REALLY WERE INCLUDED SAID THAT THE FOCUS REALLY IS A MORE ROUND AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES LIKE MASKING- AS WELL AS YOUR MAILING TESTING- THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT- IN THE STATE IS NOT AND YOU KNOW ANTICIPATING AND ENSURING THAT BACKS NATION CAN BE PROVIDED- TO TEACHERS AND STAFF AND BUT IT'S JUST NOT PART. OF THIS PARTICULAR PLAN OKAY I JUST PERSONALLY THINK IT'S HARD TO ASK- TEACHERS AND STAFF TO GO BACK WHEN THERE'S NO PLAN TO VACCINATE THEM AND WE DO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR CHANGED THE PLAN NOW FOR VACCINES TO BE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS. ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT OF THAT NEW PLAN. TOP I'LL JUST LEAVE IT IS A CALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS I HOPE YOU CAN STAY WITH US- TO THE NEXT COUPLE PANELS IN CASE WE HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. BUT WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH- SHELLEY. MAYER MONTEZ WHO IS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF CAMPBELL UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT WELCOME DOCTOR VIA MONTEZ. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND I- REALLY THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH TELLING JUST A LITTLE BIT OF OUR STORY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S LIKE MANY DISTRICTS AND- WE BEGAN LOOKING TO RE OPEN AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND ANYONE IN MY DISTRICT WOULD SAY THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYONE MORE COMMITTED TO THAT AND I'VE BEEN BUT I'VE ALSO. REALLY WANTED TO HONOR OUR LABOR RELATIONS- AND WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR AND WE WERE PARTNERS AND SO AS A RESULT WE DEVELOPED A DISTRICT WIDE RE OPENING COMMITTEE WAY BACK IN THE SUMMER WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF. OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUT OUR DISTRICT INCLUDING OUR PARENTS AND WE WORKED WITH THE GUIDELINES THAT WERE PUT OUT BY ERICA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT AFTER THIRTEEN NEGOTIATION SESSIONS WITH OUR TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND FOUR SESSIONS WITH OUR- CSEA CLASSIFIED UNITS AND WORKING WITH OUR PARENTS. WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A REAL OPENING PHASE PLANET VERY MUCH MIRRORS WHAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HERE- THAT WE WOULD START WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS FIRST AND THEN WE WOULD START WITH OUR YOUNGEST AND- GRADUATE THAT UP. THAT IS ALL PREDICT ON US BEING IN THE RED TIER IN OUR COUNTY AND SO. WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS TWO BILLION DOLLARS I WAS QUITE EXCITED BECAUSE WE HAD MATT MOST OF THE METRICS AND THEN AS WE STARTED LOOKING CLOSER AT IT I BECAME. VERY DISILLUSIONED- I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SURVEILLANCE REQUIREMENT FOR STUDENTS I HAD NOT. IN ANY OF BY MEETINGS HEARD THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE PART OF THE EXPECTATION WE WERE ABLE TO STAND UP SURVEILLANCE TESTING FOR ALL STAFF. AND THAT HAPPENS MONTHLY. BUT THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE TUDENT TESTING REALLY MADE NO SENSE TO ME BECAUSE WE WERE PUSHING OUT THE SCIENCE FROM UCSF AND FROM STANFORD TO OUR FAMILIES SO THAT THEY WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THAT WHEN WE'RE READY FOR. THE PHASE AND REOPENING. THE OUR OUR STUDENTS TWELVE AND UNDER JUST AREN'T AS IN AS MUCH DANGER AND SO WE WORK TOGETHER UNDERSTANDING OR TEACHERS UNION OUR CLASSIFIED STAFF HAVE NOT EVER. SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD TEST STUDENTS SO THEY WOULD FEEL MORE SAFE AND SO THEN LOOKING AT. THE EXPENSE FOR SURE BUT ALSO JUST THE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY I MEAN WE'VE ALREADY HAD TO STAND UP TRACKING AND TRACING WHICH YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FOR THESE. REQUIRE REST BUT WE HAVE FIGURED IT OUT AND SO WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN WE RUN PRESCHOOLS. WE ALSO RUN EXPANDED LEARNING AND WE HAVE HAD LEARNING LABS WHERE OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS ARE COMING IN AND THEY'RE EITHER BEING SUPPORTED. BY CLASSIFIED STAFF- SO THAT THE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING BEING PROVIDED BY A CREDENTIALED TEACHER OR WE HAVE SOME OF OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. WHO EVEN BEFORE WE WERE IN RED WE'RE WILLING TO BRING THEIR STUDENTS END BUT WE DID THAT ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS RATHER THAN- REQUIRING OUR WHOLE SYSTEM TO COME BACK PRIOR TO WHAT WE ALL HAD AGREED TO. AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN ADDITION TO THE STUDENT TESTING REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY ONEROUS. AND I WAS IN A MEETING WHERE IT WAS DESCRIBED THAT STUDENTS COULD SELF ASSESS WELL SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVETO MONITOR THAT PROCESS SELF ASSESSING SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO COLLECT ALL OF THAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TRACK THEM THAT'S- IN- THEN ALSO MINORS. IS THERE WOULD BE NO REQUIREMENT IF IT IF A PARENT DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT THEIR CHILD TESTED. THE CHILD WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED TO COME INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WHICH I'M CONCERNED THAT WOULD CREATE. OF A SENSE OF- WORRY BY THE TEACHER THAT DIDN'T EXIST PRIOR TO THIS SO IF THEY HAD THREE STUDENTS TO REFUSE TO TEST NOW THEY BECOME SUSPICIOUS OF WHY THAT FAMILY WOULD. REFUSE TO TEST WHEREAS BEFORE IT WAS NEVER EVEN GOING TO BE AN ISSUE SO I HAVE THAT CONCERN I ALREADY HAVE THE CONCERN FROM A SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT JUST THE CADENCE OF TESTING THAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR STAFF WILL CERTAINLY PROBABLY INCREASED. CERTAINLY PROBABLY THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY CONVINCING I BELIEVE WILL INCREASE OUR INSURANCE PREMIUMS WHICH WILL BE A ANOTHER ADDITIONAL COST TO US LOOKING FORWARD- AND SO MY ASK WOULD BE THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS IS. FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY AND WHILE YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD THAT DISTRICTS CAN CHOOSE NOT TO APPLY FOR IT. IT'S NOT MY TRADITION TO LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE. I'M AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS MONEY THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT'S BEING RE PULLED FOR CERTAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I AM- AS SENATOR CORTESE OUT ALREADY SHARED SANTA CLARA COUNTY HAS ITS- MANY DYNAMICS AND- YOU KNOW OUR PLAN DOESN'T REQUIRE VACCINATIONS BUT I WILL SAY I WAS VERY DISHEARTENED. TO LEARN THAT IN OUR COUNTY. I'M WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR GETTING TO THE LEVEL ONE BEAT FOR EDUCATORS JUST DOESN'T A PERSONALIZADO CAL FATHER WHO'S EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND HAS EMPHYSEMA WHO HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET HIS VACCINATION IN OUR COUNTY- AND SO. THERE ARE MANY WORRIES AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMENT ABOUT WHO ACTUALLY CONVEYS THIS INFORMATION AND TRIES TO BREAK IT DOWN TO OUR- AND COMMUNITY AND TO OUR STAFF AND SO WE'VE DEVELOPED THIS COMMUNICATION CADENCE AND IT'S TAKEN- ELEVEN MONTHS TO GET TRUST. THAT WE'RE NOT JUST MAKING THINGS. AND SO I WILL SAY THAT. I WAS VERY EXCITED THAT WE HAD OUR PLAN WE'RE SIMPLY WAITING FOR THE CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE AND WE'RE READY TO MOVE FORWARD AND IT FEELS LIKE YET AGAIN. THE GOAL POST MOVED AND LIKE THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND THERE ARE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE NEVER KNOWN BEFORE YOU KNOW THAT TWENTY FIVE CASE RATES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT HAD NEVER EVEN BEEN A TERM THAT WAS USED BEFORE. SO WE WERE GOING OFF OF THE FOUR TIER SYSTEM I APPLAUD MY- RIGHT. LABOR PARTNERS FOR BEING COMFORTABLE TO COME BACK EVEN WHEN IT'S IN A SUBSTANTIAL RANGE. AND ALSO THE THIS SORT OF FALSE EXPECTATION IN MY OPINION. THAT IT'LL BE TOTALLY UP TO PARENTS WHETHER OR NOT THE KIDS ARE GOING TO RETURN OR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BECAUSE AGAIN I'M JUST SHARING MY STORY WITH YOU BUT- BACK IN THE SUMMER THREE WEEKS BEFORE SCHOOL STARTED. WE ALLOWED FAMILIES WE LAID OUT OUR RE OPENING PLAN. AND WE ALLOWED FAMILIES TO SELECT IF THEY LEARNING OR IF THEY WANTED TO GO WITH A PHASED IN APPROACH AS IT WAS LAID OUT BASED ON THE TEARS AND ALL OF THAT. AND WE WERE THREE I'M IN ROLLED OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND WE MOVE STAFF AND EVERYTHING SO THAT OUR PARENTS HAD THAT LEVEL OF COMFORT. AS I LOOK AT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED. I READ IT AS THOUGH THERE WOULD BE AN EXPECTATION THAT WE WOULD YET AGAIN THIS LATE IN THE SCHOOL YEAR UP HE'D EVERYTHING ONCE AGAIN AND ALLOW PARENTS A SECOND CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY WANT TO DO THE FACE AND- RE OPENING THAT THEY AGREED TO BE FOR. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO MOVE STAFF AND ALL OF THAT AND THERE'S BEEN MUCH CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH. OF OUR STUDENTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR FAMILIES AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY GARNER AND LEVERAGED. A SYSTEM THAT SENATOR CORTESE IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH ITS CALLED SCHOOLING SERVICES WHERE WE CAN GET OUR FAMILIES CONNECTED TO RESOURCES. SO ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS WOULD BE TO CHANGE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS SO FAR INTO THE SCHOOL YEAR BY BASICALLY ALLOWING PARENTS TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THAT TEACHER THAT THEY'VE BEEN WITH. FOR THESE SIX MONTHS OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR. SO YOU KNOW I HAVE MANY MORE THINGS THAT I COULD SHARE AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. BUT I JUST WANTED TO LAY OUT. THE PRICE THAT WE'VE WORKED THROUGH WE WORK THROUGH EACH PHASE OF THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLAN THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED TO US AND SO TO HAVE THAT PLAN CHANGE AND TO HAVE THINGS MOVE. AND TO BE TOLD WELL IT'S OKAY YOU COULD JUST NOT GO FOR THE MONEY. THAT THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M NOT DOING THE MOST FOR MY STUDENTS AND MY FAMILIES TO LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE. SO BUT I ALSO VALUE A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH MY LABOR GROUPS MORE THAN THAT THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER STUDENTS. AND SO WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THE AGREEMENTS. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME OF THAT FUNDING WHEN THE CONDITIONS ALLOW FOR US TO DO SO. THANK YOU DR VERMONTERS THAT WAS REALLY ENLIGHTENING TESTIMONY AND I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION I HAVE NOT BEN ABLE TO FIND A PLACE TO GET MY PARENTS VACCINATED EITHER I TRY EVERY DAY. SO WE WILL ALL KEEP TRYING- NEXT- WE WILL HEAR FROM RICHARD BARRERA WHO IS THE BOARD PRESIDENT FOR THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WELCOME MR PERERA. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SO. SO MUCH OF. WHAT I'VE HEARD IN TERMS OF THE QUESTIONS FROM THE SENATORS AND THE COMMENTS FROM DR PETER MANTAS AND ALSO YOU KNOW THEY THE COMMENTS. I FROM I MISS HOMES AND IN THIS ROLLAND. ARE SO CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED EYES SINCE MARCH SO AND JUST BACKING UP A LITTLE BIT SO IT'S SENATOR UNIFIED WERE THE SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA AND- WE- ARE EDUCATE DIRECTLY A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS. I APPRECIATED TWELVE WE HAVE ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND OUR STUDENTS AND. IN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT. ABOUT THREE PER. OF OUR STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS ABOUT 15% OF OUR STUDENTS. I HAVE I EAT PEAS. AND OUR DISTRICT FOR OVER A DECADE NOW HAS HAD A CONSISTENT FOCUS ON EQUITY. YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS ASK OURSELVES WHY DO WE NEED TO BE DOING AS A SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE NO BACK UP. TO SCHOOLS I'VE BEEN THERE AND BEING EFFECTIVE WE HAVE A DIVERSE DISTRICT AND SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE. OUR FAMILIES IN OUR DISTRICT THEY TO HAVE BACK ABSENT IN CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF THE PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO AND PAY FOR TUTORS AND ESTABLISH PODS- BUT- THE SUB DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. I NEARLY 90% OF OUR STUDENTS QUALIFY OF OUR STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH HIGH PERCENTAGES OF ENGLISH LEARNERS THERE IS NO BACK UP I TO OUR TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS PROVIDING. OUR STUDENTS WHAT. THEY NEED. AND SO. TAKING THAT ON ACT IN THIS. WE YOU KNOW I IT IT WAYS I SOMETHING THAT KEPT UP AT NIGHT. I CLOSING IN FIRST. BECAUSE WE KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I IF I IF OUR STUDENTS WERE IMAGE EVEN TWO WEEKS A MONTH I'VE HAD SCHOOL. AND THE OF BAD WE QUICKLY JUMPED INTO. PROVIDING I THREE DAYS A WEEK HI I THREE THREE MEALS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WE DISTRIBUTED OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND HI COMPUTER DEVICES WE TALKED OUR STUDENTS UP TO. UP TO THE INTERNET WE MAINTAIN THIS CONSTANT FOCUS ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND THEN AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH I DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC. TO BE FRANK ARE WE WERE GETTING VERY VAGUE AND IN SOME CASES CONTRADICTORY I ADVICE I WHETHER IT WAYS THAT CDC OR THAT IT'S GUYS CD P. H. R. OR OTHER I YOU KNOW I ENTITIES. AND SO WHAT WE DID IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR UNIONS I'M RATHER THAN ARGUE OVER SCIENCE AND HAVE YOU KNOW EACH OF US INVENTING OUR OWN SCIENCE AND CHERRY PICKING OUR OWN RESEARCH WE WENT TO A TEAM AT UC SAN DIEGO. OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERTS IN KERALA G. IN AT THE GENEALOGY IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND THAT TEAM CAME TOGETHER AND WE ASK THEM FOR CLEAR GUIDELINES ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO SAFELY REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS AND THEY LAID OUT VERY CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR US IN EARLY AUGUST. AND THOSE INCLUDED COMMUNITY SPREAD METRICS. POSITIVITY RATE NEEDS TO BE BELOW 8% I YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT HOSPITALIZATION HOSPITAL CAPACITY ICU CAPACITY. ALL OF THOSE METRICS. ARE THE TEAM AT UCSD LAID OUT FOR US AND THEN THEY SAID NOW IF THE COMMUNITY IS MEDIAN THOSE METRICS AND HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN SCHOOL. FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE YOU'VE GOTTA PUT ALL OF THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE YOU'VE GOT A REVAMPS AWAIT YOUR CLASSROOMS YOU GOTTA PROVIDE MASKS YOU'VE GOT TO PROVIDE SMALL COHORTS OF STUDENTS IF YOU COME BACK IN WHEN YOU COME BACK. I YOU'VE GOT TO BE CLEANING YOUR CLASSROOMS EVERY DAY YOU'VE GOT TO SET UP. I STATION AS- STAGE IN EVERY. AND WE DID THAT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID WITH YOU KNOW SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT CAME. AT THE STATE GENEROUSLY PROVIDED I YOU KNOW THROUGH THAT HI I'D THROUGH THE CARES ACT. WE SPENT FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PUTTING INTO PLACE THE MEASURE IS NECESSARY. TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS WHEN THEY COME BACK ON CAMPUS AND THEN. WE WENT TOGETHER WITH OUR UNIONS TO UCSD AND WE SAID HOW FREQUENT SHOULD WE BE TESTING OURS OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF. IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS SAFE. AND OUR MODEL WAS PROVIDED THAT I THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S GUIDELINES. THAT SAID IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY USE TESTING AS A PREVENTIVE STRATEGY YOU SHOULD BE TESTING ONCE TO TWICE A WEEK. I'M SORRY MARC ONCE A WEEK TED SAID TO TWICE A MONTH. AND SO WE SET UP A TESTING SYSTEM WITH UC SAN DIEGO HEALTH AND WE HAVE SINCE DECEMBER. I'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THAT TESTING SYSTEM BUT I WILL TELL YOU IT TAKES TIME. TO PUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FULLY IN PLACE AND BY THE WAY THIS IS A TESTING SYSTEM WHERE. UC SAN DIEGO HEALTH. PROFESSIONALS COME ONTO OUR CAMPUS IS DIRECTLY ADMINISTER THE TEST AND THEN TAKE CARE OF THE BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE PUT THAT IN PLACE AND WE'RE PAYING FOR IT. OUT OF OUR OWN. OUT OF OUR OWN FUNDS. AND NOW TOGETHER WITH UCSD AND R. I. I'D- OUR OUR OUR- I. HEALTH. ADMINISTRATOR WE'RE GOING TO THE COUNTY AND WE'RE SAYING WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO ACCELERATE GETTING OUR EDUCATORS VACCINATED. AND WE'RE CLOSE TO HAVING AN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD- I SPEED UP. THE PROCESS FOR GETTING. OUR R. EDUCATORS. VACCINATED AND WITH ALL OF THAT IN. ALL THE THAT WE BEEN DOING A COLLABO WITH ARE YOU. TO GET US THIS. AND BY THE WAY OF COURSE WE TO GO. YOU KNOW AGREEMENTS WITH OUR UNION. TO FULLY TRANSFORM OUR SISTER INTO A FOR SYSTEM IN THE SPRING. WE MAY GO NEW AGREEMENTS I'D SAY CREATE MORE ROW. DISTANCE LEARNING MORE WE STARTED IN THE FALL. I WE HAVE NICK. AN AGREEMENT WHERE WE ALLOW OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS TO COME ONTO OUR CAMPUS FOR IN PERSON. SERVICES WHETHER IT'S STUDENTS WITH IEPS ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE HOMELESS STUDENTS. OR STUDENTS WHO SIMPLY ARE IDENTIFIED BY THEIR TEACHERS AS FALLING BEHIND IN MEETING IN PERSON SERVICES AND WE BEGAN TO BRING SOME OF THE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS AND WE'VE DONE THAT. FOR NEGOTIATION. WITH OUR UNIONS. I HAVE BEEN DOWN ALL OF THE- WHEN WE LOOK. THE PLAN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S LAID OUT. THE PLAN SIMPLY WILL NOT HELP US IT WON'T HELP US GET TO RE OPENING ANY SOONER BY THE WAY AND YOU KNOW I'LL JUST YOU KNOW SAY THAT AS YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE DO NOT NEED FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO REOPEN. WE NEEDED TO BE SAFE WHEN IT'S SAFE WE ARE READY TO REOPEN AND WE INTEND TO REOPEN WE CERTAINLY NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO PAY FOR ALL OF THE THINGS OUR STUDENTS NEED BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT. FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WILL PUSH US I TO REOPEN MORE QUICKLY THAN WHEN WE BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY SAFE TO DO SO OUR CASE RATE IN SAN DIEGO OUNTY TODAY. ADJUSTED CREEK CASE RATE IS OVER SIXTY PER HUNDRED THOUSAND THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT TWENTY FIVE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH IT YOU KNOW BY MID FEBRUARY IT'S SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD EVEN GET DOWN YOU KNOW INTO INTO THAT LEVEL BY MARCH OR APRIL IS VERY MUCH UP IN THE AIR OF COURSE WE HAVE NOW A SECOND STRAIN. OF THE VIRUS YOU KNOW THAT'S MOVING FORWARD THAT MAY CREATE FOR ALL WE KNOW A NEW SEARCH AND BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT WAITING WE'RE GOING BACK TO OUR UCSD EXPERTS. INSANE LET US KNOW HOW THE SCIENCE IS APPALLED AND GIVE US NEW. GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT SAFE I THREE OPEN. WITH ALL OF THAT IN PLACE HE WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO ANY. WE NEED. TO GET OUR AND- BACK. AS QUICKLY AS- THAT HAS TO. AND IT IS ENTIRELY UP. FOR OUR EDGE. GIVEN THE RATE THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO STAY. NOW THAT WERE ON THE VERGE OF HAVING A VACCINE AVAILABLE. WE SHOULD GET THAT VACCINE ARE BEFORE WE TAKE A RISK AND GO BACK SO WE NEED THAT VACCINE AND WE NEED IT AS URGENTLY AS POSSIBLE. WE NEED THE FUNDING TO POKE FULLY PAY FOR THE TESTING SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS WERE SO ON POINT. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IF WE WERE TO TEST ONCE A WEEK THAT WOULD BE ABOUT SIXTEEN TESTS. BETWEEN MID FEBRUARY AND THE END OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR. OUR ARRANGEMENT WITH UC SAN DIEGO IS FOR FORTY DOLLARS A TEST WHICH IS THE ENTIRE TESTING PLUS THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT'S. SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS PER STUDENT. THAT'S THE IN. REAL RIGHT RIGHT THERE IF WE WERE TO SPUR ALL THAT TESTING AND BY THE WAY WE DON'T BELIEVE. THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT SHOULD BE PAYING FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES LIKE TESTING. THAT SHOULD COME OUT OF THE STATE RECEIVED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE MOST RECENT COVERED RELIEF FIND FOR TESTING WE KNOW THAT THE BY DID ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW IS TRYING TO MOVE ADDITIONAL TESTING AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOLS. THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO PAY FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES LIKE TESTING BECAUSE WATER WE NEED THE PROP NINETY EIGHT TWENTY FOUR. WE NEED IT NOW. FOR OUR STUDENTS THAT NEED SUPPORT NOW. WE HAVE A NEED FOR THE EXTRA CANCELING WE HAVEN'T NEED FOR EXTRA TIME WITH OUR STUDENTS EVEN IF THEY ARE CONTINUING A DISTANCE LEARNING WE HAVE THE NEED FOR SOCIAL WORKERS WHO CAN HELP OUR FAMILIES NAVIGATE. I SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO EXPAND OUR ON CAMPUS I IN PERSON SERVICES FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND BY THE WAY WE'VE- AYE THAT INCLUDES PRESCHOOL ELEMENTARY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. BUT THAT REQUIRES RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF I SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS NEEDS SO IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS A PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE. THAT WE ARE I WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY BE ABLE TO USE FOR MOST OF OUR STUDENTS CERTAINLY FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ANY TIME DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR TO TAKE THAT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND HAVE IT SITTING IN A POT THAT WE CAN'T USE WHEN WE HAVE REAL NEEDS RIGHT NOW. FOR OUR-STUDENTS SO OUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE. IN ADDITION TO THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR HI I PROPOSAL FOR INTERVENTION FOR STUDENTS THAT WE CAN USE NOW AND INTO THE SUMMER ACTUALLY I PLAN FOR THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO NEED. TO OVERCOME WHAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PANDEMIC. TAKE THAT FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF PROP NINETY EIGHT BUNNY. ADD TO THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT RIGHT NOW IS IN A FRANKLY UNWORKABLE PLAN. THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS PUT INTO RE OPENING AND ALLOW US TO USE THOSE RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS NOW AND THEN TO PLAN FOR THE SUMMER AND THEN TO FOCUS ON WHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO NEED GOING INTO THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND WHEN IT IS SAFE TO RE OPEN WE. WILL RE OPEN AT THAT POINT. WHEN WE HAVE THEIR BACKS. WHEN THE FINE. I HAD TO DO FULL TEN THAT. THAT PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS ADVISE US TO DO. AND WHEN THE CASE RATES. HAVE COME DOWN TO A POINT. THAT IT WILL ASK BE SO. YOU KNOW FOR OUR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF TO RE OPEN AND I WOULD JUST LEAVE YOU WITH KIND OF YOU KNOW THIS. THIS IS WHAT YOU KNOW KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT. IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A LOT OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS A LOT OF PARENTS WHO TRUST THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. WHEN WE SAY TO OUR PARENTS. IT IS SAFE FOR YOUR KIDS TO COME BACK TO SCHOOL. AND WE HAVE THE RIGHT INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOUR KIDS LEARN. WHEN WE TELL OUR PARENTS THAT. THEY WILL BELIEVE US. SO WE BETTER GET IT RIGHT. AND WE BETTER BE MOTIVATED BY WHAT ACTUALLY WILL KEEP OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF SAFE WHAT ACTUALLY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM FOR OUR KIDS AND THAT BETTER BE OUR ONLY MOTIVATION AS WE THINK ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS PROCESS AFTER THE REST OF THIS YEAR INTO THE SUMMER AND NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR PERERA THAT WAS ALSO REALLY HELPFUL TESTIMONY THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CHRIS EVANS WHO IS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NEW THOMAS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WELCOME SUPERINTENDENT EVANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS THIS OPPORTUNITY SO I'M CURRENTLY IN MY NINETY YEARS THE DOMES INVITES YOU PRETEND IT IN MY TWENTY NINE YEAR EDUCATION CAREER I WORKED AS A CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER ATHLETIC COACH SITE LEADER AND CABINET MEMBERS IN ELK GROVE UNIFIED FRESNO UNIFIED LODI UNIFIED AND NOW OF COURSE THE THOMAS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE THOMAS UNIFIED IS LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO AND IT'S TWICE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES IS THE SECOND MOST DIVERSE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE NATION WE SERVE ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS OVER HALF OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ON FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH IN BETWEEN 62263% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AS UNDUPLICATED. FOR ELSE IF THAT PURPOSES OUR GRADUATION RATE IS CONSISTENTLY BETWEEN 9495% AND A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY RATE IS AS HIGH AS SIXTY TWO PERCENT. SINCE LAST MARC RICH OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN IN DISTRICT LEARNING IT MARCH TWENTY TWENTY WE TOOK WHAT WE ORIGINALLY CALLED A LONG WEEKEND TO CLOSE SCHOOLS THE FIRST EXAMINE THE FIRST STATE GUIDELINES ONCE WE GOT A CHANCE TO REALLY DIG IN AND TAKE A LOOK WE REALIZED IT WAS GOING TO BE A WHILE BEFORE IN PERSON CLASSES RETURNED. WE QUICKLY ACTED TO FEED OUR STUDENTS PROVIDED LAPTOPS TO EVERY STUDENT WHO NEEDED ONE DISTRIBUTED MOBILE INTERNET HOT SPOTS TO ANY FAMILY WHO ASKED ONE BY ACQUIRING THEM VERY QUICKLY AND WE EVEN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME EXTRAS. WITH OTHER NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS YOU RANCHO YOUR- AS THE SIDE NOTE. PROVIDING THIS IN ACCESS. IS COSTING A TERMS YOU KNOW. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR A MONTH. BY APRIL WE MANAGED ELIMINATE DIGITAL IN THE TRUMP UNIFIED BY SAYS. JUST YOUR LAPTOP AND HOSP. LIKE WERE TEXTBOOK BUT THIS TIME USING YOUR THROUGH UP. LOW AT OUR SCHOOL SITES WE WILL ONE AS FAR AS TO TRACK DOWN STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS AND AT TEMPLE RELOCATED TO HOTELS IN NEIGHBORING STATES SAYS CITIES DELIVERING- THE TECH NEEDS TO OUR STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY WHEREVER THEY WERE LOCATED. WE NEVER EXPECTED THOUGH AT THAT TIME THAT THIS WOULD CONTINUE FOR ALMOST A YEAR. DISTANCE LEARNING WAS PUT TOGETHER QUICKLY IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY IT WAS ALMOST AN EMERGENCY ACTION FOR US. IT TOOK MULTIPLE NEGOTIATION SESSIONS BUT WE HAD ONE OF THE STATE'S FIRST MO USE ON DISTANCE LEARNING WE REMAIN GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK THAT ARE DISHONEST TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ENGAGE WITH. ON THAT. EVEN UNDER A TWO YEAR CLOSE CONTRACT WE FOUND OURSELVES NEGOTIATING TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN THESE PAST TEN MONTHS. HEADING INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR IT WAS UNANIMOUS TEACHERS PARENTS ADMIN AND OUR BOARD ALL AGREED THAT DISTANCE LEARNING NEED TO BE APPROVED. IT TOOK ALL SUMMER IN A TWO WEEK DELAY OF THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR TO NEGOTIATE A NEW FORM OF DISTANCE LEARNING. THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE EMERGENCY ACTIONS WE'VE TAKEN IN THE SPRING. WE REMAIN IN THAT FORM OF DISTANCE LEARNING TODAY WE DO HAVE SOME SMALL COHORTS THAT FOR THAT EXIST FOR SOME OF OUR FIRST RESPONDER FAMILIES WORKING FAMILIES. AND HIGH SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS. OR PARENTAL INTEREST HAS CHOI OVER TIME. LAST SUMMER IT WAS ABOUT THE MID 707374% OF OUR PARENTS WANTED SOME FORM OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BY THE TIME THE MOST RECENT SURGE BEGAN TO CLIMB IN LATE OCTOBER EARLY NOVEMBER THAT IT ACTUALLY DROPPED 2403% WE ENGAGE OUR COMMUNITY ON A FREQUENT BASIS TO GET A POLLS FOR WHAT THEY'RE SEEING AND FEELING AND THINKING. RIGHT NOW WE'RE DEVELOPING WHAT WE CALL AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PLAN TO ADDRESS LEARNING DISRUPTIONS AND THE PROPOSAL THAT IS OUT THERE TO PROVIDE NEW RESOURCES TO ADDRESS- WHAT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO IS LEARNING LOS. IS ESSENTIAL TO FULLY PROVIDE A- WITH WHAT OUR STUDENTS NEED. WE BELIEVE THAT LEARNING HAS NOT BEEN LOST JUST DISRUPTED. WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN FILL THE GAPS THAT EXIST FOR OURS ARE OUR KIDS BECAUSE OF THESE DISRUPTIONS. WE USE MULTIPLE DATA POINTS STUDENTS STAFF AND PARENTS FEEDBACK TO IDENTIFY THOSE STUDENTS FOR WHOM DISTANCE LEARNING IS NOT WORKING OR THERE MAY BE EITHER ACADEMIC PHYSICAL OR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DISRUPTION. IN THE FALL THIS PAST FALL THE NEW THOMAS UNIFIED SCHOOL BOARD DID VOTE TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AFTER RENEGOTIATED YET AGAIN ANOTHER AGREEMENT WITH OUR TO THOMAS TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. THAT AGREEMENT REQUIRED JUST TWO WEEKS OF RED STATUS REMAIN OPEN IN FACT SACRAMENTO WAS TRENDING TOWARDS ORANGE AT THE TIME SO RELIGION AMID HOPE AND OPTIMISM. THEN CAME THE SURGE. AND WE REMAIN IN DISTANCE LEARNING. OF THE MAJOR OUTLINED- ITEMS OUTLINED IN THE NEW PROPOSAL AND THE CONSOLIDATED GUIDANCE WE HAVE NEARLY ALL OF THEM COVER. THE BUDGET DECISIONS MADE BY CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR ALLOWED US TO CONTINUE IN DISTANCE LEARNING IMPROVE DISTANCE LEARNING STARTED NUMBER OF NEW ACTIONS AND PREPARE FOR AN EVENTUAL IN PERSON RE OPEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUDGET APPROACH LAST YEAR WE HAVE THE PEAVEY WE NEED WE HAVE REPLACE ALL OLD FILTERS WITH TALK POSSIBLE QUALITY FILTERS. WE ARE PLACE PORTABLE THE FILTERS AND CLASSROOM AND WORK SPACES AND WE HAVE HAND SANITIZER SOAP AND TOILET PAPER TO KERRY IS FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. WE HAVE BROUGHT IN A THIRD PARTY ENGINEER TO CREATE CLASSROOMS SPECIFICATIONS DESIGN TRAFFIC FLOW ON CAMPUSES AND DISTRICT BUILDINGS AND HELP WITH SIGNAGE SO EACH SCHOOL AND WORK SPACE WILL BE CERTIFIED AND HAS BEEN CERTIFIED. BY AN ENGINEER THAT OUR PLAN IS EFFECTIVE AND SAFE. FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS. WITH THE ADDITION OF RIVER. WE HAVE OPEN VIRTUAL DURING. HIGHER MULTI NEW SOCIAL. FOCUSED FOR HOME AND FOSTER YOUTH EVEN GOING AS FAR AS HELPING SH. OUR SOME OF OUR UNSHELTERED HOMELESS FAMILIES OF FIND SHELTER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN IT WAS EXTREMELY COLD AND RAINY IN AN EFFORT TO RE ENGAGE THEIR STUDENTS BACK INTO SCHOOL AS WE WERE MONITORING DATA NOTICED THOSE STUDENTS. OBVIOUSLY BEGAN TO NOT ATTEND DISTANCE LEARNING WE'VE CREATED VIRTUAL EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND FOLLOWING SPORTSCARD GUIDELINES WHEN WE CAN WE'VE KEPT STUDENTS SAFE DURING SPORTS CONDITIONING WITH AN AMAZING GROUP OF COACHES WHO OF ALL THE GUIDANCE AND CONTINUED TO HAVE A ATHLETIC CONDITIONING IN PLACE. WE'VE EXPANDED A TWENTY FOUR HOUR A DAY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT NETWORK THESE ARE JUST A FEW THE ACTIONS. THAT WE'VE TAKEN WITH THE RESOURCES MOSTLY THE ONE TIME MONEY WE'VE. BEEN PROVIDED IN THE PAST YEAR. IT BACK I WAS THIS- THE MONEY AND THE THAT THE STATE TOOK- DEFINITELY CHANGE LIVES AND MOST DEFINITELY SAVE SOME LIVES HERE AND IT'S ALMOST. WELL THE GOVERNOR SAFE SCHOOL PLAN FOR ALL HELP SCHOOLS OPEN SAFELY. TO BE HONEST MUCH OF WHAT IS IN THAT PLAN IS WHAT WE NEEDED THIS PAST SUMMER TO OPEN MORE SAFELY ON TIME FOR THIS PAST FALL. I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CRITICAL I'M JUST PROVIDING ASSESSMENT FROM THE FIELD FOR SOMEONE WHO IS HELD MULTIPLE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS IN SCHOOLS OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES. AND SHARE THAT PARENTS ARE NO LONGER LOOKING TO COVER TESTING THEY'RE LOOKING TO COVERT VASTLY VACCINATIONS. AND YES PARENTS HAVE HEARD THE PROPOSALS FOR RE OPENING IN PERSON AND WE HAVE BEGIN TO SEE THE LARGEST INCREASE. OF COMMUNICATIONS TO OUR CONSTITUENT CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICE OR BOARD MEMBERS AND MYSELF SAYING QUOTE NOW THAT WE CAN OPEN. DOT DOT DOT. THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF ALL THE STIPULATIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND TRY TO EDUCATE. THE PARENTS ON WHAT AND WHEN- IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US TO OPEN BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT NOW WE ARE AT FIFTY FOUR POINT 6% BERMAN FIFTY FOUR POINT SIX CASES. OUT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND STILL VERY CLEARLY FAR AWAY FROM THE TARGET A TWENTY FIVE- FRANKLY- WE RECOGNIZE THAT- MORE TESTING IS NOW AVAILABLE- COMPARED TO LAST SUMMER AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE WE UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE VIRUS AND WE HAVE MORE ACCURATE NUMBERS ABOUT WHERE THE BUDGETS ARE. SO IT'S A LOT EASIER TO DO A LITTLE BACKSEAT DRIVING NOW TODAY THAT AND- BACK INCIDENT IN SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY. SO HOW DO WE OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO FOCUS ON A WAY TO GET VACCINATIONS IN THE ARMS OF OUR CITIZENS IN A WAY THAT WILL TRULY ALLOW FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN ITS ESSENTIAL EDUCATORS ARE PRIORITIZED BECAUSE LIKE IT OR NOT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATION IS LARGELY AT IN IN PERSON STAND STILL FOR A MULTITUDE OF REASONS. IF WE HAVE TO FULLY NEGOTIATE THE NEW GUIDANCE I FOR LITTLE CHATS FOR EQUITABLE IN PERSON CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION IN THE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT IT THOMAS E HAVE A STRONG LABOR- PARTNERSHIP. WITH RCS LOCAL SEVEN FORTY FIVE AND NOW THIS INCREASING PATTERN OF REALLY DELIBERATE SUCCESS AND INCREASING POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR TO THOMAS. ASSOCIATION LEADERS. ARE IMHO YOU THAT WAS ACTUALLY APPROVEDBY OUR TEACHERS AND OUR BOARD OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SAYS THAT IF NEW STATE GUIDANCE IS PRODUCED. THE TWO PARTIES WILL MEET AND CONFER. THAT IS LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BE MORE NIMBLE TO GET TOGETHER AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS GINS. IF THE OPEN RE OPENING PLAN REQUIRES ANOTHER MO YOU ANOTHER PERIOD OF NEGOTIATIONS THAT AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THE THOMAS UNIFIED WOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN. MY CHIEF ACADEMIC. OFFICER WHO'S IN CHARGE OF ALL OF ACADEMICS IN THE THOMAS UNIFIED AND I HAVE HONESTLY SPENT THE BULK OF THE LAST YEAR NEGOTIATING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. THIS IS WHY WHEN WE TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR EIGHTEEN MONTH PLAN TO ADDRESS LEARNING DISRUPTION. WE'RE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT A PLAN BECAUSE IS NOT YET DONE. WE ARE SPENDING TIME- NEGOTIATING AN ADJUSTING EVERY TIME NEW GUIDANCE COMES OUT. ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE CAN SEE HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT IN SMALLER COUNTIES AND EVEN IN NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. THAT EDUCATORS ARE BEGINNING TO GET THE VACCINE. IN AT IN THE THOMAS WE HEAR WELL SACRAMENTO IS URBAN. SO IT'LL TAKE MORE TIME AND THERE ARE MORE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY URBAN I WONDER WHY THE SECOND MOST DIVERSE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE NATION AND ONE OF THE MOST INTEGRATED CITIES IN THE NATION SACRAMENTO IS NOT WITH OTHER REGIONS IN FRONT OF THE LINE. TO ME IT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE A COLLECTION OF SUPERINTENDENTS WERE INFORMED THAT THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO NOT NECESSARILY THE HEALTH PROVIDERS IN SACRAMENTO BUT THE COUNTY ITSELF RECEIVE JUST NINE HUNDRED AND CHANGE VACCINES LAST WEEK. JUST NINE HUNDRED AND CHANGE VACCINES IN THE COUNTY'S LARGE OF OURS MEANS THAT- AS I HEARD A FEW PEOPLE MENTION EARLIER. I AM NOW CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPENING OF SCHOOLS IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WHAT CAN OPEN OUR SCHOOLS WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS THAT VACCINATION PLAN TO GET THOSE MILLION THAT ARE STILL WAITING TO BE DISTRIBUTED OUT TO URBAN AREAS. LET'S TAKE THIS PROPORTIONALITY IN DISPARITY HAD ON. NUST HAS HAD THEIR OWN TESTING SITE WITH THIS SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND WE'VE TESTED OVER EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE FOUR COVE ED. WITH JUST ONE DAY A WEEK OF TESTING MATERIALS AND WE DO DO OUR OWN CONTACT TRACING FOR EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS. I KNOW THAT'S FAIRLY UNIQUE. I HEAR FROM COLLEAGUES AT THE CADENCE OF TESTING THAT'S BEING PROPOSED FOR MANY DISTRICTS WILL PREVENT THE RE OPENING AND MAYBE EVEN FOR SOME THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN A RETURN TO DISTANCE EARNING. I TO OF HEARD THAT MANY WILL NOT APPLY FOR THE GRANT. IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF THE CADENCE OF TESTING. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THIS THIS STATE IS WORKING ON THAT CADENCE WELL BASED ON SOME OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY- POTOMAC COVERED TESTING. IN OTHER DISTRICTS IS NOT A CONCERN IT THOMAS UNIFIED BECAUSE OUR EXPERIENCE AND COMMITMENT WE HAVE EARNED A STATE CLIA WAIVER TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A GRANT THAT THE STATE PROVIDED. THEY HAVE FREE RAPID COBIT TESTING IN ADDITION TO OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. WE ARE TO BE ABLE TO TEST OUR STUDENTS AND WE HAVEALREADY BEEN TESTING STAFF AND A BROAD RANGE OF COMMUNITIES MEMBERS. MARGIN WHAT WE COULD DO FOR VACCINATIONS. IN THE THOMAS UNIFIED AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE WILLING WITH ACCESS TO FOOTBALL STADIUMS. GYMS AND AMAZING STAFF THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO STEP UP AND HELP. I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE READY TO RAPIDLY INTO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AS A STATE TO EQUITABLY EXPAND THE VACCINES AS FAST AS THE FEDS IN THE PHARMACEUTICALS WILL PROVIDE US WITH THEM. WE MUST REMEMBER THAT PERFECTION IS OFTEN THE ENEMY OF PROGRESS LET US PROVE WE CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION WITHOUT JUST MORE MORE REQUIREMENTS BEING GIVEN TO US FOR A TASK AND RE OPENING THAT MAKES REAL OPENING IN PURSING AND- LESS LIKELY. GIVE US A HUNDRED VACCINES AND WE'LL GET A HYBRID VACCINATIONS IN WHOMEVER CALIFORNIA WANTS US TO SENIORS EDUCATORS WHOEVER THEY PRIORITIZE GIVES A THOUSAND WILL DO THE SAME THING. LET US MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE ARE DISTRICTS POSITION TO HELP VACCINATE AND ASSIST OTHER DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES WHILE PLANNING FOR STUDENT SUCCESS FIRST WE NEED THE OPPORTUNITY SECONDLY WE DO NOT NEED MORE REQUIREMENTS WITH INTRACTABLE IN PRACTICAL BOLD TIMELINES. THIS IS THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET'S SHOW EVERYONE WHAT WE CAN DO AND GET OUR SCHOOLS BACK. IN PERSON AGAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EVANS MORE GREAT TESTIMONY THANK YOU VERY UCH MEMBERS BEFORE WE GET TO OUR NEXT PANEL ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BEFORE WE MOVE ON. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR THE PRESENTATION. I ALSO WANT TO PROTECT RECOGNIZE THAT CHRIS EVANS WHO'S THE SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT MY CHILDREN ATTEND AND THEY ARE DISTANCE LEARNING. SO CERTAINLY MY CHILDREN ARE NOT IN DOING ANY IN PERSON. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VACCINATIONS- THAT- MEMBER MY FAMILY IS A HEALTH CARE WORKER. I GUESS YOU CAN PUT YES WHO IT IS BECAUSE- AND- SHE HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY NOTICE WHEN SHE'LL GET HER VACCINE AND MY MOTHER. IS ALSO. THIS IS IN THE HIGH RISK CATEGORY AND HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION WHEN SHE'LL GET HER VACCINE AS WELL SO. JUST DOES THE COMING ABOUT MAXINE DISTRIBUTION- SO AGAIN I WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR- TESTIMONY- I DID HAVE A- AND I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE VACCINES AND- WE'RE TRYING TO WORK TO GET. PEOPLE VACCINATED BUT THERE'S ALSO SUPPLY ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THAT TO PREVENT EVANS MENTIONED IT WAS THE- THIS WEEK- SECOND THE ENTIRE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO. AT LEAST SECOND COUNTY BBC DAVIS OR SOME OTHER SCOTT AND I KNOW THEY'RE PUSHING THEIR VACCINES OUT CLEARLY GOT UNDER THOUSAND DOSES VENTURA COUNTY. SO IT'S GONNA TAKE AWHILE- BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT TESTING AND I APPRECIATE THAT- BOTH- SUPERAR BOROUGH SAN DIEGO ANSWER PRINT EVANS IN A THOMAS TALKED ABOUT THE WERE ABLE TO SET UP TESTING REGIMENS INTER SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT SOUNDS LIKE ONE WITH THE HELP OF. THE UC SAN DIEGO. THE OTHER ONE OF THE HELP OF THE LOCAL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND THEN- SUPERINTENDENT- MONTEZ I PRESUME DO YOU SINCE YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT- THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A TESTING REGIMEN. OVER AND CAMPBELL THE MOMENT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE TO ALL THREE OF YOU IS EARLIER ON I DID ASK- MR ALLEN FROM STATE FOR THAT. ASIAN ABOUT. YEAH THE TECHNICAL SO AND- AND THE SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM AT THE AT THE- AND THEIR CUP TO THE OF US- BOTH TECHNIQUE AND INFORMATION TO HELP SCHOOL SET UP TESTING CAPACITY AND US AS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS AND PERHAPS- CAN YOU COMMENT ON IT IS TO HAVE HAVE YOU GOTTEN ENOUGH INFORMATION OR ASSISTANT AND I JUST INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST INFORMATION IT'S ACTUALLY THE CAPACITY DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S ENOUGH CAPACITY. IN THIS THAT THAT THE STATE IS PROVIDING IN TERMS OF ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND NOT ONLY YOUR OWN BUT ALSO PERHAPS OTHER ONES THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IN YOUR AREA- TO BE ABLE TO WELL FOR EXAMPLE ONE REQUIREMENTS IS THIS TESTING CAPACITY IS THAT THE OF THE DO YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AND WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM. ME THE BARGAINING YOU KNOW REPRESENT BARGAINING UNITS- AND THE NEXT PANEL I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH WORK DONE TO EDUCATE BOTH THE- EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES AND THE EVIDENCE NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO REOPEN SAFELY ARE PEOPLE LITTLE BIT LOST AT SEA ABOUT IT AND SPECULATING ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO SO- IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I CAN ASK EACH OF YOU TO BRIEFLY TRY TO THOSE. QUESTIONS I JUST SENATOR PAM I JUST WANTED TO RISK TO THE FACT THAT- WE DO HAVE A LOOK AT TESTING CADENCE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. AND WE TEST ALL THOUSAND EMPLOYEES OUR SCHEDULE IS ONCE A MONTH- MY CONCERN WAS WITH ANY TYPE OF STUDENT TESTING. AND SO AND WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO GET A- I CONTRACT. WITH SECURE CURETIS AND- SO THAT'S WHO WERE USING AT THIS POINT AND THEN WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT COLOUR. AND FORWARD THIS STUDENT TESTING IF THAT DOES BECOME A REQUIREMENT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING THAT. WATER TESTING AND WORKING FROM THERE. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION I SPENT. APPRECIATE IT- IN TERMS OF- ITS ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM. FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT. I'M OUT IN HONEST I THINK WE SHOULD THAT. IT'S A VERY NEW I'M COMMITTEE AS I UNDERSTAND IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HAVE. WOULD STILL REALLY APPRECIATE IS SOME SORT OF TEMPLATE THAT ESSENTIALLY SHOWS THIS IS WHAT WAS IN THAT- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIREMENTS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE WORKING FROM PREVIOUSLY AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED WHERE YOU COULD JUST QUICKLY CROSSWALK THAT. BECAUSE N. AS YOU'RE KEENLY AWARE WE ALSO HAVE OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIREMENTS SO WE HAVE TO LOOK EACH TIME AT WHICH IS MORE STRINGENT AND FOLLOW THOSE MOST STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS AS WE'RE DEVELOPING THE PLAN AND SO EACH TIME THERE'S AN UPDATE THEN WE UPDATE THE PLAN PUT THAT OUT TO OUR COMMUNITY. TO CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO UPDATES- SO THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS DOES GET CONFUSING AND AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE SOCIAL MEDIA DOESN'T HELP US ON THESE THINGS BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF RESEARCH STUDY THAT SAYS. ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS- SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO GET WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO BE THE FACTS IN FRONT OF OUR FOLKS. I APPRECIATE I KNOW YOU'RE ALSO TO HAVE A THEIR- BE THE CAL IN THE STATE. AND THE BIGGEST WE CAN DISCUSS OUR- PERHAPS SUPER DAMPER DO YOU WANT US TO THE AND ALSO WHAT DO YOU SOMETIMES FOR CONFLICTS BETWEEN WHAT YOU SEE SAN DIEGO WHO YOU'RE WORKING WITH. AND THE STATE ARE I MEAN THAT SO JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- THE TERMS OF HOW EFFECTIVE IS A SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF. PROVIDING SUPPORT AND INFORMATICS FOR YOU TO FOR YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND INFORMATION T EMPLOYEES AND PARENTS. FOR YOU GOT THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR PANFILO YOU KNOW BACK IN AUGUST WHEN I CDPH PUT OUT ITS- ITS GUIDELINES AT THAT POINT I. WHAT A TIME. WHAT ADVISED WAS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD DO YOU HAS SEEN EMPLOYEES. ONCE. EVERY TWO MONTHS. AND- AND BECAUSE OF THAT ARE ON BOB VEGGIE AND OUR ARE COUNTY GOT. SET UP I ITS FIRST TO ALASKA DISTRICTS TO DO THAT. BUT BASED ON FEEDBACK YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN GETTING FROM. OUR OUR OUR EASIEST SCIENTISTS WHAT THEY WERE SAYING IS THAT IS NOT AN ATTIC FREE. OF TESTING. ACTUALLY I. YOU KNOW GET THE US. THAT WE CAN I WHO ACTUALLY IS CARRYING A FIVE ON OUR CAMPUS. AND SO WE SPENT REALLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR OUR TEACHERS UNION. TO AND- I DE WHAT WE BE THE RIGHT. FREQUENCY AND I'M THAT I'VE EASIER DEFINE CAME WITH BASICALLY CHAU BAD. IF YOU WANT TO USE TESTING AS AN ACTUAL PREVENTIVE STRATEGY USED TO BE TESTING EVERYBODY ON CAMPUS STUDENTS AND STAFF ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS MINIMUM. AND BASED ON THAT I A GUIDANCE WE WENT WENT ABOUT AND DEVELOPED APR A PROGRAM WITH YOU SAN DIEGO HEALTH I AND WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH UC SAN DIEGO HEALTH ACTUALLY COME ONTO OUR CAMPUS AND PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF TESTING BUT I WILL SAY WE BEGAN THAT TESTING PROGRAM IN DECEMBER. AND WE ARE RIGHT NOW BUILDING IT UP TO GET TO THE POINT THAT WE COULD HAVE IT ON EVERY SCHOOL WE'VE BEEN DOING AT TEN NEW SCHOOLS A WEEK BUT WE KNOW IT WILL TAKE US TIME TO GET TO THE POINT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THAT LEVEL OF TESTING AVAILABLE AND THIS IS. YOU KNOW- IF THIS IS YOU KNOW HI FOR PARTNERS IT'S ACT NOW I YOU KNOW FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST ADD IS WE RECOGNIZE THAT WERE IN A PRIVILEGE SITUATION AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE WE'VE GUIDE INTERNAL RESOURCES YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE GOT AT SCHOOL NURSES WE'VE GOT IT ON. A STAFF PEDIATRICIAN I AND WE'VE GOT A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH UC SAN DIEGO HI WHERE THE CHANCELLOR'S BEEN VERY COMMITTED TO THIS AND OUR OUR CONTRACT WITH UCSD ALLOWS US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AS TESTING TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES AND WE THINK UCSD WILL BE ON THE FOREFRONT OF DEVELOPING THAT TECHNOLOGY THE DISTRICT GETS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. I AS WE GO FORWARD THAT'S A PRIVILEGED POSITION FOR A DISTRICT TO TAKE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DISTRICTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE YOU KNOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT KIND OF I INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS ANY PAIN IN OUR SITUATION. WE WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE IN A POSITION THAT WE WOULD BE READY TO DO THAT KIND OF FREQUENCY OF TESTING WITHIN YOU. KNOW ANOTHER MONTH IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO ROLL THIS OUT. AND IN JUST THE UP- NOW THAT THE CURRENT RECORD DIRECTLY GOVERNOR'S. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SAID DAVE RECOGNIZING SOME OF THE THAT YOU FROM YOU SEE TO ASK THAT DO SURVEILLANCE TESTING AT IS EVERY RIGHT THE PROPOSED- SO YOUR EXPIRY AND YOU HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU SEE. TO SET UP SPEED UP YOUR TESTING REGIMEN- AND SO I'M HEARING FROM YOU YOU'RE SAYING THAT WELL FIRST OF YOU HAVE THIS ALL SEEM TO REALLY. WITH A LONG TIME TO STAY IT UP- YOU ARE YOU GETTING. AND THEN PERHAPS SINCE YOU'RE HAVE THIS I MEAN IT IS DO YOU THINK THE SCHOOL SO TEAM ARE THE STATE IS ABLE TO HELP OUT WHETHER IT'S YOU OR OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND YOU MAY NOT HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP TO STAND UP THE TESTING REGIMEN. AS QUICKLY AS BEING PROPOSED. WELL WORSE WERE AND WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH TI BEFORE WE YOU KNOW FINALIZE OUR DECISION TO WORK WITH UCSD IT. YOU KNOW IN OUR TESTING PROGRAM WE DID HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE- REGARDING MALE REPUBLICANS ARE CONTRACTING THE BLIND SEALAB. IN QUITE FRANKLY THERE ARE A LOT OF AND I AM QUESTIONS THAT WE A KNACK. WHEN WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TEST STUDENTS ON WHAT IS YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW NOT JUST ON. PROTEST BUT THE PRICE YOU HAD SET SAID WHO'S GOING TO COME ON AND DELIBERATE ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO COME ON AND WEBER AT ON CAMPUS. THAT WAS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THAT WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION BUT WE FELT THAT THE ANSWERS WEREN'T IN PLACE AT THAT POINT. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. YOU KNOW WE WERE EAGER TO MOVE FORWARD IF YOU SEE A STATE IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THE UCSD IS A PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITY WITH A PUBLIC MISSION. I AND WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN BENEFIT AS- AS YOU CST YOU KNOW PROGRESSES IN THEIR IN IN AND DEVELOPING BETTER TESTING TECHNOLOGY. I'M SO YOU KNOW. I DON'T DOUBT THAT I THE TIME THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE STATE IS SETTING UP RIGHT NOW TO YOU. I PROVIDE INFORMATION DISTRICTS IS THAT I DON'T DOUBT THAT THEY HAVE THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND THAT THEY'VE GOT VERY YOU KNOW CREDIBLE I PEOPLE. I'M WHAT I. WOULD BE SKEPTICAL OUT IS WHETHER IT BACK INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT HAVEN'T EVEN BEGUN YET TO DO DEVELOP A- PER. SIR S. TAX YOU. THE FREAK THAT THE RIGHT. THAT WOULD BE A TO DO IT I YOU KNOW. AND I. THANK YOU AND I GUESS UP SILVA AND- DID YOU HAVE ANY BRIEF. COM GIVEN YOUR- SURE I IN INTO OF THE ACCESS TO THE STATE- MY AT MY STOP MOSTLY INTERACTS THE STATE AND THEY NOT HAD ASKED ME WHY. TO STEP IN A TRY TO GET EXTRA SOME TO GUIDE THEY'VE VERY BY. OUR SACRAMENTO PA HEALTH BEEN SENT- THE DEATH NEED MORE BODIES MORE BE THEIR OWN. BUT EVERY TWO. I CALL DOCTOR CONSIDERING IT SHOULD PICK UP THE PHONE- SHE WILL CALL ME BACK IMMEDIATELY AND I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S DOING THAT- KNOWING THAT I'M JUST ONE OF PROBABLY HUNDREDS OR CALLING HER EACH DAY. IN TERMS OF PARENTS AND STOP BEING ADEQUATELY EDUCATED ABSOLUTELY NOT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IF THIS IS OUR FOURTH OR FIFTH- GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS- IT CHANGES SO MUCH. AND THEN AND THEN PURPLE THEN BECAUSE I PER. AND YOU KNOW START. WE WORK ALL BUT THEN WE WERE ASKED TO CLOSE DOWN AND THEN WE WERE ALLOWED TO EAT OUTSIDE AGAIN AND- AND I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT TO MY OWN FAMILY. AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THAT KIND OF CONFUSION- IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING I ALSO NEED TO POINT OUT THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT TESTING IS A MAJOR PART. I SAID OUR DISTRICT EXECUTED- I AGREE WITH RICHARD YOU SAID IF THE COMMUNITY HAS STARTED ALREADY THEY'RE- CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. IN IN LITTLE ON THE SHORT TIME FRAME IT TOOK US MONTHS TO POLITICALLY CONVINCED PEOPLE WE CAN DO IT. AND THEN WE STARTED IT AND THEN WE HAD A SHORTAGE OF TESTING AND THEN WE NOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD A CADENCE. BUT IT IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE TALENTED PEOPLE. WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT WHICH IS TALKED ABOUT HOW GIFTED. HE IS OUR DISTRICT I FEEL THE VERY SAME WAY WE HAVE EXTREMELY TALENTED PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE BUYING TESTING IS THE ANSWER AND ALL POLITICS ASIDE. I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE TESTING PLAN AND HOW SOUTH THAT WENT SO QUICK- AND HOW MUCH THAT WS COVERED- ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN SOCIAL MEDIA. PEOPLE ARE BUYING TESTING IS THE ANSWER- THEY ARE THEY ARE ASKING ABOUT THE VACCINES THE READING THE NEWSPAPER THAT SAYS THERE'S- YOU KNOW 90% OF THEM STILL SITTING. IN THE FREEZER SOMEWHERE. THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT VACCINATIONS MORE THAN THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TESTING AND WHETHER OR NOT HAT'S THE REALITY OR NOT. WHEN WE TRY TO ARTICULATE THIS PLAN TO THEM THEY DON'T HEAR THE TESTING. THEY THEY WANT TO KNOW WHEN THE VACCINATE VACCINATIONS AND QUITE FRANKLY SUPERINTENDENT EVANS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET THOSE FOR US. OKAY AND SO THAT I THINK THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHERE OUR COMMUNITY. AND PROBABLY MOST OF OUR STATE IS. RIGHT NOW. THANK THANK YOU- I IT REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THOSE ANSWERS- YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY. I HOPE THAT WITH THE NEW LEADERSHIP AT. THE FEDERAL LEVEL WERE WE'RE GOING TO BE L. THE RAMP UP ON THE BACK. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT SURE. WE CAN. MESS WAIT FOR THE JACKSON- I WILL TELL YOU THAT- CERTAINLY PURSE. I WOULD LIKE TO STEAL TO SEE KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL. EARLIER POSSIBLE- AS A PEDIATRICIAN IS SOMEONE WHO- FOLKS ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT. BUT I WAS ALSO A- PHYSICIAN CONSULTANT TO SCHOOL DISTRICT BEFORE I CAME INTO LEGISLATURE AS WELL. AND UNDERSTAND- MANY OF THE CHALLENGES ABOUT- TRYING TO BE SURE WE KEEP. THOSE KIDS AND STAFF SAFE AND- AND SOME OF THOSE THOSE CHALLENGES AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT- SO. BUT WOULD SAY IS THAT I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO WHAT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE. BUT I AM ALSO VERY CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING. ENOUGH EVEN CAPACITY IN- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT OKAY YOU WHAT COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO HELP OUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THOSE. SET UP. TESTING OR YOU'RE GONNA GIVE SUPPORT TO THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO DO THAT I MEAN I JUST KNOW WHAT'S GOING HERE LOCALLY RIGHT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEMSELVES THAN IN A I'M GLAD TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU. THAT HAVE ACTUALLY DONE IT BUT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU NEED MORE SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO T. THAT UP. AND THAT'S ALSO INCLUDES RESOURCES RIGHT AND- WE HAVE MORE SPECIFIC PLANS FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO MAKE TESTING CHEAPER. FULL TESTING AND SO FORTH. DO WE HAVE SPECIFIC PLANS WE LAID OUT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT'S ONLY ONE PIECE OF THIS WHOLE THING. AS WELL. AND AND CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE VACCINES BUT- AS WELL AS WHEN WE GET THOSE SUPPLIES BUT I THINK THAT- I WOULD. REALLY LIKE TO HEAR BY TIME WE FINISH UP MAYBE GOING BACK TO- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN TERMS OF HOW THE WHAT REALLY IS THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS I THINK IS REALLY A CRITICAL QUESTION IS NOW WE DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS. BYE BYE AND- GONNA HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT CAPACITY. AND SO I THINK WITH THAT ASSEMBLY WHAT- APPRECIATE. AND- AND THANKS SO MUCH MANAGE. THANK YOU CENTER PAN TO ANY OF OUR OTHER MEMBERS TO CALL. OKAY WE'RE GONNA ON TO OUR NAY AND LAST PAN WE'RE GOING TO WITH THE CHIP. WHO IS A TO OF GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WELCOME MR SHAPIRO. THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL OF A MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I DON'T ENVY THE POSITION THAT ALL OF YOU ARE IN AS ELECTED LEADERS IN OUR STATE IN MY DOZEN YEARS OF LIKE LEADERSHIP. I NEVER FACE THE SORTS OF CHALLENGES THAT YOU GUYS ARE UP AGAINST RIGHT NOW AND SO I'M NOT ENVIOUS OF THE POSITION THAT YOU'RE IN BUT- ANXIOUS AND EXCITED TO BE HERE TO OFFER OUR PERSPECTIVE. AND SO I JUST FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHAT TO JUST SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT WHO WE REPRESENT. THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS- INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS PARA EDUCATORS- BUS DRIVERS FOOD SERVICE WORKERS CUSTODIANS MAINTENANCE WORKERS. OFFICE STAFF ATTENDANCE CLERKS MANY OTHERS- WITHIN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM BASICALLY THE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT CERTIFICATED. IN OUR MEMBERS AS MANY MAY KNOW AND SOME MAY NOT KNOW. BUT MANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE THE START OF THE CRISIS. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS- NEVER WENT HOME IN MARCH WHEN COVERED HIT OUR SHORES. AND HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS- IN SOME CASES OR FOOD SERVICE- FOLKS HAVE BEEN PREPARING MEALS FOR KIDS ON FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. OUR TRANSPORTATION FOLKS HAVE BEEN DELIVERING MEALS ARE I. T. FOLKS HAVE BEEN PROPPING UP DISTANCE LEARNING. OUR FOLKS HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS IN MANY CASES. I WANT TO. BE CLEAR THAT OUR MEMBERS AND YOU KNOW OUR OUR SISTER UNIONS I'M SURE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS AS WELL. BUT OUR MEMBERS FEEL STRONGLY- THE SAME WAY THAT SOME OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE HAVE EXPRESSED. THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IS FAR SUPERIOR TO DISTANCE LEARNING AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE OUR STUDENTS. BACK IN SCHOOLS WE THINK THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THEM BACK IN PERSON- DEVELOPMENTALLY- SOCIAL EMOTIONALLY THAT IT IS- THAT THAT IS THE SUPERIOR METHOD OF- OF PROVIDING THIS SORT OF INSTRUCTION WE NEED TO PROVIDE. WE ALSO AGREE THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY HAS TO BE OUR TOP PRIORITY THAT HAS TO REMAIN OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. LEDS NEED THE RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THESE DUAL GOALS. OF PROVIDING THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND pOF STUDENTS AND STAFF ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. HUMAN RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING BOTH OF THOSE GOALS. AND UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO INEQUITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR WAY OUT PROTECTION LAWS IN THIS STATE. THOUSANDS OF CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. ARE NO LONGER IN THEIR POSITIONS ARE HAVE BEEN LAID OFF OR OUT OF WORK FOLKS MANY FOLKS WHOSE JOB IT IS TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE. THE FOLKS WHOSE JOB IT IS TO PROVIDE THE ONE THE ONE INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORTS THAT ARE NECESSARY. MANY OF THOSE FOLKS IN MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE HAVE BEEN LAID OFF. AND SO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN CAPITAL NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. MISS HOLMES MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH. AND THAT'S TRUE IN SOME PLACES- DISTRICTS ARE AHEAD OF THE GAME. BUT IN SOME PLACES DISTRICTS ARE FAR BEHIND. IN CERTAIN PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE LAID OFF EVERY PARA EDUCATOR IN AN ENTIRE COUNTY. THE NEEDS THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE WHEN THEY RETURN. TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO GET THE ONE TO ONE SUPPORT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LACKING THE ENTIRE TIME THEY'VE BEEN GONE IN DISTANCE LEARNING IN PLACES LIKE THAT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT IN PLACE THE NEEDS THE HUMAN CAPITAL NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET. AND I WILL SAY- YOU KNOW I REPRESENT CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES I STARTED MY CAREER AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I HAVE A MASTERS IN EDUCATION AND IN STUDY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. AND I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S AWARE AND I KNOW THAT THE EDUCATION EXPERTS ON THIS CALL ARE WELL AWARE. THAT WHEN STUDENTS HAVE LEARNING DEFICITS. WHEN STUDENTS ARE BEHIND. WHEN WE HAVE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS- WHICH WE'D LIKE TO REFER TO MORE ACCURATELY IS OPPORTUNITY GAPS IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. THERE IS REALLY ONE SOLUTION ONE SOLUTION THAT WORKS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. AND THAT IS INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT. AND IT IS OUR MEMBERS IT IS PARA EDUCATORS PRIMARILY- WHEN THE CERTIFICATED INSTRUCTOR DOES NOT HAVE THE TIME OR RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THAT INDIVIDUAL I SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A CLASS FULL OF STUDENTS IT IS PARA EDUCATOR TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT IT'S JUST. CRITICAL THAT THAT BE A COMPONENT OF THIS PLANET WE APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL- FOR THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. MENTIONS THAT ONE OF THE APPROPRIATE USES ONE OF I BELIEVE NINE USES OF THOSE FUNDS. IS TO INCREASE THE HUMAN CAPITAL TO PROVIDE THAT ONE TO ONE INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT THAT OUR STUDENTS WILL BE IN DESPERATE NEED OF. AND THAT'S THAT'S APPRECIATED THAT'S MENTIONED BUT IT'S JUST ONE OF NINE OPTIONS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT DISTRICTS WHO HAVE BEEN OUT BEEN WITHOUT THESE PERIGEE CATERS IN SOME CASES FOR MONTHS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BRING THEM BACK NOW. TO PROVIDES SUPPORT TO STUDENTS IN DISTANCE LEARNING AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BRING THEM BACK. WHEN WE BRING STUDENTS BACK FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THAT HAS GOT TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM NOW THAT IN. MORE THAN A CENTURY OF EDUCATION IN THIS STATE AND CENTURIES OF EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL PROBABLY NEVER HAD BEFORE AND THAT IS THE RANGE THE EDUCATORS ARE GOING TO FACE IN TERMS OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE FROM THE STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO ARE WHO ARE AHEAD TO THOSE WHO ARE THE FURTHEST BEHIND. IS GREATER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION WE'VE FACED OVER THE LAST TEN MONTHS. AND IT'S INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT. AND ONE TO ONE SUPPORT. TO GET US BACK TO GET OUR STUDENTS TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. NOW OBVIOUSLY HEALTH AND SAFETY AGAIN IS OUR TOP PRIORITY IN MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN GET TO THAT POINT. AND MANY OF US IN THIS MEETING HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SCHOOL RE OPENING SINCE JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY- ODD. SOME EVEN BACK TO APRIL IN MAY WHEN WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE EXTENDED. MANY OF US WERE INVOLVED IN A TASK FORCE THAT MET TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK IN A CHECKLIST. TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS WERE READY TO RE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. BACK IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER THAT WAS THE GOAL. WAS TO START THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH FOLKS IN PERSON. AND WE CREATED SOME CRITERIA WE CREATED A CHECKLIST THAT WE FELT. GIVEN THE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND IN SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE SCHOOLS. PLACES THAT WERE SAFE FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN TERMS OF THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS WAS MUCH WORSE THAN WE EXPECTED IT WOULD BE. IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER AND MOST SCHOOLS DID NOT REOPEN AT LEAST UNIVERSALLY FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THIS SITUATION TODAY IS SO MUCH WORSE. IN NEARLY EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE WHEN IT WAS IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. THAT IT JUST IT SEEMS SORT OF OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE REALITY ON THE GROUND. TO BE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT RUSHING TO RE OPEN AND GETTING FOLKS TO SUBMIT PLANS BY TEN DAYS FROM NOW- WHEN THE REALITY ON THE GROUND IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN IT WAS LAST AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. SO WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT YOU KNOW DIED MISS HOLMES MENTIONED EARLIER THERE ONLY SIX COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT ARE EVEN ELIGIBLE. AT THIS POINT TO REOPEN. AT THE TWENTY FIVE CASE RATE TWENTY FIVE NEW CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND SO IT IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S IMPORTANT INAPPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE HAVING THE CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY AND HAVING A CALMER CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW ABOUT TARGETED INTERVENTIONS FOR STUDENTS EXPERIENCING LEARNING LOSS AND HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT GETTING KIDS BACK. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE APPROPRIATE CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAVING RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THE EXPECTATION THAT WE'RE SETTING UP IN THE STATE. AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN CAME OUT. I WILL SAVE MANY PARENTS FRIENDS OF MINE NEIGHBORS. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE I GOT AN EMAIL JUST THIS MORNING. FROM ONE OF OUR MEMBER LEADERS OFFER AND FROM ONE OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS SAYING HEY WE WERE HURRYING WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR PLAN DONE BY FEBRUARY FIRST IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NEW PROGRAM. OF THE PERCEPTION OUT THERE IS THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED. THAT THE WORK OF THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT'S ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR AND THAT THERE'S NEW MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE GOING TO REOPEN AS SOON AS TEN DAYS FROM NOW. SO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS EXPECTATION SETTING IS ALSO IMPORTANT. AND THAT. WE NEED OUR STAFF OR MEMBERS OUR STUDENTS ARE PARENTS OR EDUCATORS ACROSS THE STATE TO UNDERSTAND THE REALITY. THAT WE ARE NEAR THE PEAK OF THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT. WE ARE ENGAGED IN MAKING PLANS TO ENSURE. THAT OUR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY AND OUR STUDENTS CAN BETTER GET BACK FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BUT THAT'S JUST NOT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS A STATE IT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE WITH THIS FOR THIS VIRUS WE ARE IN A MUCH WORSE POINT THAN WE WERE. IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. WE SHARE THE CONCERN OF SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES- IN MANAGEMEN WHO HAVE RAISED. THIS ISSUE OF. THE USE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT FOX. WE SHOULD BE CLEAR PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS ARE MEANT TO BE SPENT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES. AND THE WAY THAT THIS THE GOVERNOR'S PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED. WHAT IS ACTUALLY TAKE DOLLARS THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD ALL BE RECEIVING ANYWAY. WHAT HOLD THOSE DOLLARS BACK. AND SAY THAT THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO RUSSIAN CREATE THIS PLAN AND EXECUTE IT AND NEGOTIATED BARGAIN WITH THEIR EXCLUSIVE WRAPS AND SUBMIT IT WITHIN THE NEXT TEN DAYS EVEN THOUGH THIS BILL IS NOT EVEN. A PASSED THE LEGISLATURE BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. THAT BOB THIS IS FOLKS WILL THAT MONEY JUST ONLY MAYBE GET A LITTLE MORE THAN THEY WOULD'VE GOTTEN OTHERWISE. AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE BEING MORE REALISTIC AND DELIBERATIVE AND ENSURING THAT THIS PLAN MAKES SENSE AND I'M NOT GOING TO RUSH TO SUBMITTED BY FEBRUARY FIRST. WILL GET LESS MONEY THAN THEY WILL GET IF THIS PROGRAM IS AN PASSED. SENATOR GLAZER- I THINK POINTED OUT WELL. THAT THERE ARE SOME SCHOOLS THAT AREN'T EVEN ELIGIBLE. THOSE SCHOOLS IF THIS PROGRAM BECOMES LAW WELL ACTUALLY GET LESS MONEY. THEN THEY WOULD GET IF THIS PROGRAM DOESN'T BECOME LAW BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PROBLEM NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS AND WE'RE JUST REARRANGING DECK CHAIRS. AND SO- DROP NINETY EIGHT IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE REVENUE SOURCE FOR THIS OR NOT THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCE. FOR THIS PROGRAM IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS LET'S TALK ABOUT THE USE OF. A DOLLARS BEYOND PROP NINETY OR FEDERAL DOLLARS. AND YOU KNOW LIKE MISTER BREYER SAID- THE FACT IS THAT GIVEN THE COST OF TESTING THESE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT MOSTLY ON BACK. LINE ITEM OF TESTING. SO JUST ADDING TO THE POINT OF THE FACT THAT THIS MONEY THAT IS MEANT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES SHOULD REMAIN AND CONTINUE TO BE SPENT FOR THAT PURPOSE LET'S ALLOCATE DOLLARS LET'S NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS IN TERMS OF INSTRUCTION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY LET'S MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT NOT USING. INSTRUCTIONAL DOLLARS. I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE TIMING IS UNREALISTIC- AS I SAID ABOUT EXPECT YOU KNOW CENTER CORTESE THINK HIGHLIGHTED WELL HOW THE EXPECTATION SETTING IS SORT OF OUT OF WHACK WITH THE REALITY ON THE GROUND. THIS CHECKLIST JUST CAME OUT LAST THURSDAY. WHICH MEANS ALLEY AS ONLY KNOWN WHAT THEY NEEDED TO INCLUDE IN THEIR COVERT SAFETY. INFORMATION THEY GOT A WEEK AGO TO DEVELOP A COVERAGE SAFETY PLAN TO BARGAIN THE EFECTS OF THAT PLAN WITH THEIR- EMPLOYEES. TO HAVE THAT RATIFIED BY THOSE EMPLOYEE UNITS TO SUBMIT THAT PLAN TO THE STATE. ALL OF THAT WITHIN THE NEXT TEN DAYS. IT'S UNREALISTIC AND THERE'S JUST NO POINT IN RUSHING TO CREATE THESE PLANS ALL THE SUDDEN WHEN THIS BILL IS NOT EVEN YET ALL. TO ANSWER- THE CHAIRWOMAN'S QUESTION EARLIER. TO HAVE IT ANSWERED BY JESSICA HOMES INTO TO HEAR THAT RESPONSE ABOUT RELIEF US NOT EVEN KNOWING AT THIS STAGE. OUR WHICH DISTRICTS ARE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WHICH DISTRICTS HAVE COVERT SAFETY PLANTS WHICH OF THOSE DISTRICTS HAVE THOSE PLANS RATIFIED I THINK THE THOSE ANSWERS TO THE CHURCH QUSTIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS PLAN IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME. NOW TO BE CLEAR I APPRECIATE OUR MEMBERS APPRECIATE. INCREASE TRANSPARENCY THAT COMES FROM THE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLANNED THE BROADER PLAN NOT JUST THIS IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT PROGRAM WE APPRECIATE THE DEFINITIONAL CLARITY THAT CDPH HAS. PUT IN THIS CONSOLIDATED GUIDANCE WHICH AGAIN IS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THIS GRANT PROGRAM WE APPRECIATE THE- THIS REVELATION OR REALIZE ATION BUT YOUNG KIDS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER WEARING MASKS THAT WE THOUGHT THEY WERE. IN FACT IN MANY CASES ARE BETTER AT DOING IT THAN ADULTS ARE BECAUSE- THEY'RE THE WAY THEIR BRAINS WORK THIS LEARNED BEHAVIOR HABIT FORMING IS MUCH EASIER FOR THAN IT IS FOR ADULTS. WE APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION OF THE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PP IS AVAILABLE TO THE STAFF THE TESTING IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT INCLUDING SURVEILLANCE TESTING. BUT WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE WORD VACCINE DOES NOT EVEN APPEAR. IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. SO IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF VACCINES OR HIGHLIGHTING IT SIGNIFICANTLY THE WORD VACCINE OR VACCINATION DOES NOT EVEN APPEAR IN THE TRAILER BILL. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT- AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T NOTICE. THE MANAGEMENT FOLKS IN LABOR FOLKS IN THIS MEETING SOUND SEEMS TO BE ARE LARGELY IN AGREEMENT. THAT VACCINES HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR COLLEAGUES AND MANAGEMENT WHO HAVE RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING THAT IN THE CONVERSATION WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE OURS WE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THIS OUR STATE IS BEHIND IN VACCINATIONS WE ARE BEHIND IN DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE VACCINE I HAVE MANY COLLEAGUES WHO I. SERVED WITH- FOUR WHEN I WAS AN EDUCATOR AND ARIZONA THE VAST MAJORITY OF MY EDUCATION FRIENDS TEACHERS CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ADMINISTRATORS. ARE HAVE ALREADY SCHEDULED THE APPOINTMENT FOR THEIR SECOND DOSE OF THE VACCINE. SO WE HAVE TO GET VACCINE DISTRIBUTION ROLLING THAT'S GOT TO BE A BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CONVERSATION. BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RE OPENING FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. ZERO ONE LIKE IF I CAN ASK YOU TO WRAP UP YOUR ABOUT TEN MINUTES OF YOUR FIVE MINUTES. SORRY SO- YES ALL I AND I YOU KNOW THAT THE BINS IN CONCLUSION LET'S LET'S KEEP THE COMMONSENSE PLAN THAT BRINGS KIDS BACK FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS SOON AS IT SAFE. LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE HUMAN CAPITA TO MEET THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND INSTRUCTIONAL NEEDS LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOT RUSSIA NOT BECAUSE OF POLITICAL PRESSURE BUT BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS NEED US TO GET IT RIGHT FOR THEIR HEALTH. AND SAFETY AND FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OURS OF OUR MEMBERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. THE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE NOW GOING TO HEAR FROM LAURIE EASTERLING WHO IS THE MANAGER OF LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MOVE ALONG BECAUSE WE DID ACTOR ASKED DR VERDICT- FREE FROM CDPH TO BE ON AN ANSWER QUESTIONS AND WE ONLY HAVE HER UNTIL TWO- MISS EASTERLING PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S LORI STERLING MANAGER LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I'M HERE REPRESENTING OUR- THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS EDUCATORS AND SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M THANKING OUR MANAGEMENT PARTNERS FOR THEIR RECOGNITION THAT IT IS A LABOR MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AND I TRULY. APPRECIATE THAT ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS. IT NORMAL CO. NON IN. NON CO THE TIMES- ARE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. REACH NEARLY TWENTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS FIVE DAYS A WEEK. AND THERE'S NO OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR THAT THAT HAS THAT KIND OF REACH AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THERE'S OVER SIX MILLION KIDS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS EACH ONE OF THEM HAS TO IMPORTANT CARE GIVERS. AND OUR EDUCATORS HAVE A VERY UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE AND ARE CLASSIFIED WORKERS AS WELL. AND THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF SAFETY AND THE PERFECT WE HAVE A PROFOUND CONSIDERATION THE CONCERN FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK AND LIVE. COMMUNITIES THAT NEED RESOURCES TO LOWER THE TRANSMISSION. AND A THOUGHTFUL XCELERATED PLANNED FOR THE VACCINATION. BEFORE DISCUSSING THIS ADMINISTRATION SAFE SCHOOL FOR ALL PLAN REFERRED TO AS THE SAP. WE NEED TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE CURRENT DATA AND JUST TO PROVIDE CONTEXT TO THIS CONVERSATION. I JUST WANT TO REVIEW THE STATEWIDE CO THE DATA ARE CTA STAFF BOB PRODUCES REPORTS BASED ON THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE C. T. PH. THE DATA THAT'S OUT THERE AND DOES THESE REPORTS FOR US WEEKLY. SO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN BASED ON THE CASE RATES THAT WERE REPORTED JUST THIS LAST WEEK. CASE RATES ROSE AGAIN R. TWO HUNDRED FIVE POINT FOUR PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WE DID HAVE A DIP IN POSITIVITY RATE THE STATEWIDE SEVEN DAY AVERAGE WAS FIFTEEN POINT TWO. HOWEVER THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDS MAINTAINING THE TEST POSITIVITY RATE AT 5% OR LOWER. AND A PURPLE TRAPPED HERE THRESHOLD INDICATES WIDESPREAD RISK AT 8% ON THE AND IN EQUITY B. HEALTH INEQUITY STILL PERSISTS CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE AND HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO FACE SERIOUS HEALTH INEQUITIES WITH VERY HIGH DOUBLE DIGIT POSITIVITY RATES REACHING AS HIGH AS TWENTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN PER THE STATE'S HEALTH EQUITY AT METRICS. ALL THAT FOR COUNTIES ARE IN THE PURPLE TEAR. MANY COUNTIES CONTINUE TO SINK INTO DEEP PURPLE THE PURPLE CHAIR IS THE JUST IN CASE RATE THRESHOLD OF SEVEN CASES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. RIGHT NOW FIVE COUNTIES ARE TEN TIMES PURPLE INCLUDING FRESNO LOS ANGELES MADERA SAN JOAQUIN INVENTOR A- AND SEVEN COUNTIES ARE TEN TIMES PURPLE INCUR INCLUDING KERN KINGS MERCED MONTEREY RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARD DINO AND TOOK TO LARRY. OUR EDUCATORS WANT TO GET BACK TO THE CLASSROOMS AND CAMPUSES BUT DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS TEACHERS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITIES. OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS WE'VE SUPPORTED THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATORS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE PP FOR SCHOOLS LOBBY FOR KOBE NINETEEN TESTING AND TRACING OF STUDENTS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. ADVOCATE FOR COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORT TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS ASKED FOR A BILL AVAILABLE ACCESSIBLE CO THAT NINETEEN RELATED DATA AND ADVOCATED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS TO ACCOUNT FOR KOBE NINETEEN RELATED COSTS. YOU CAN READ OUR PREVIOUS LETTERS THAT WE SENT IN JULY JULY EIGHTH AUGUST THIRTEENTH SEPTEMBER SIXTH DECEMBER FIFTEENTH AND JUST TWO DAYS AGO ON JANUARY NINETEENTH. AND I WILL SAY THAT WE DO AGREE WITH OUR MANAGEMENT PARTNERS THAT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MOST RECENTLY OUTLINED IN THE GUIDANCE AND THE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL PLA WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME OF THAT INTERVENTION AND ASSISTANCE LAST SUMMER AS WE WERE PLANNING FOR SAFE RE OPENINGS. THERE ARE CONCEPTS IN THE SAP THAT THAT DO HAVE MERIT. THERE IS A BENEFIT TO OUR MEMBERS AND OUR STUDENTS. AND SCHOOLS A BIG SALMON DISCUSS THE MOST THOUGHTFUL RESPONSIBLE ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL. THEREIS A WAY TO IMPROVE UPON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN AND WE HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL PARTNER WITH US TO DO THAT. THE FIRST CELL ELEMENT IS TRANSPARENCY RESHAPED THE SAP INCLUDING ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC AND KEEP PRIVATE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS INCLUDING GLUCK NOTIFYING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES OF PROFIT POSITIVE COPING NINETEEN CASES IN SCHOOLS SCHOOL CLOSURES AND THE NUMBER STUDENTS ARE FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION HYBRID MODELS AND DISTANCE LEARNING. THE PROPOSAL ALSO REQUIRES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS TO POSTER COBIT NINETEEN SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS ON THEIR WEBSITE WE SUPPORT THESE PROVISIONS. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF A PHASED IN APPROACH THE SAP PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS IN A PHASED IN APPROACH AND WE SUPPORT THAT IDEA AS WELL. AS FAR AS UNIFORM STANDARDS WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S WORK IN ADOPTING THE EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STANDARD ISSUE BY CAL OSHA. WE BELIEVE THE STANDARDS WILL MAKE OUR SCHOOL STAY FOR. THE PROPOSED SAP PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR TESTING CONTRACT RACING FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF BUT ONLY AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING SAP INCENTIVE DOLLARS. TESTING IS NOT REQUIRED FOR ELEAZER NOT APPLYING FOR THE DIVISIONAL DOLLARS. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL SCHOOLS NEED RESOURCES FOR STUDENT TESTING. AND STAFF. STUDENT AND STAFF TESTING AND THAT SHOULD BE QUICK BE REQUIRED BASED ON THEIR COUNTY TEARS THEIR CASE RATES AND HEALTH EQUITY INDEX. FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE APPRECIATE THAT THE SAP REQUIRES COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THE INCENTIVE GRANT FUNDING. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE SAP COULD CREATE CONFUSION AND CAUSE ELEAZAR TO IGNORE SAFETY WHEN REOPENING SCHOOLS IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO APPLY FOR THE GRANT FUNDING. RESOURCES WE APPRECIATE THE SAP PROVIDES DOLLARS PER STUDENT FOR A RE OPENING AND SUPPLEMENTAL STUDENT SUPPORTS. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT ALL SCHOOLS NEED RESOURCES WHEN THEY CAN SAFELY RE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AS WELL AS RESOURCES TO HELP STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN IN DISTANCE LEARNING. WE KNOW THAT FEDERAL DOLLARS WILL BE COMING TO THE STATE SHORTLY THAT WILL DIRECTLY FUND COBIT MITIGATION STRATEGIES. WE WOULD WANT THE STATE TO USE THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS BEFORE USING PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS. HOWEVER THE STEP THE SAP FALL SHORT IN SOME VERY IMPORTANT WAYS. THE SAP ENCOURAGES RE OPENING FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN PURPLE TEAR AND I SAY DEAR AND I DARE SAY THE DEEP PURPLE TEAR. THIS IS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE CAN LEND THEIR VOICE TO HELP IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. THE PURPOSE HERE IS NOT SAFE. THE SAP ALLOWS FOR SCHOOLS REOPEN IF THEY'RE BELOW TWENTY FIVE CASES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH IS NEARLY FOUR TIMES THE GUIDANCE FROM LAST SUMMER INDICATED THAT ELEMENTARY WAIVER SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED IF THE COUNTY WAS AT AT AT A DOUBLE THE BASELINE RATE OF FOURTEEN CASES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS SAFE TO REOPEN IN PERSON FOR IN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE PURPLE TEAR. THE ADMINISTRATION CREATED THE HEALTH EQUITY INDEX TO MEASURE CO THE TRANSMISSION BY THE CENSUS TRACTS COMPARED TO THE COUNTY. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE IMPROVED IF THE HEALTH EQUITY METRICS WERE INTEGRATED AS A CRITERION TO ENSURE IMPROVED CONDITIONS FOR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES HARDEST HIT BY COBIT NINETEEN. THE NEXT IS THE TIMELINE THE TIMELINE IS TO COMPRESS FOR MEANINGFUL PLANNING WE SHARE THE CONCERNS AS NOTED BY THE L. A. RO IN THEIR OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET THAT THE SHORT TIME FRAME AND THE SIGNIFICANT STEP SCHOOLS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE. IS LIKELY AND FEASIBLE AND COULD DISCOURAGE SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTICIPATE. OUR MANAGEMENT PARTNERS HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS ON TIMELINE AND IMPLEMENTATION. ALSO AS YOU ALL HAVE HEARD PREVIOUSLY VACCINATIONS ARE NOT PART OF THE SAP. VACCINATIONS ARE OUR SCHOOLS HOPE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO ACCELERATING VACCINE ROLLOUT AND WE ARE HEARTENED THAT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ARE CONSIDERED WITH OTHER CENTRAL WORKERS AND INDIVIDUALS OVER SIXTY FIVE IN TIER ONE B. VACCINES NEED TO BE PART OF THE SCHOOL REOPENING CONVERSATIONS. SCHOOLS NEED A COORDINATED BACKSEAT VACCINATION PLAN SO THAT SO THAT STAFF STUDENTS PARENTS GUARDIANS AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WHO ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WERE ELDERLY OF TIMELY AND ACCESSIBLE VACCINATION OPPORTUNITIES. FINALLY WE NEED TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. SAFELY RE OPENING FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IS ONLY ONE PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION WE NEED TO PARTNER ON WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN THOUGHTFUL PLANNING FOR TARGETED INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR STRUGGLING STUDENTS. INCLUDING RESOURCES FOR ONE ON ONE TUTORING AT IDENTIFYING LEARNING NEEDS AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES. THESE SERVICES AND SUPPORT SHOULD BE VIEWED IN A MULTI YEAR APPROACH WE MUST ALSO FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE CHILD INCLUDING APPROPRIATE COUNSELING MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER WRAPAROUND SERVICES. WE STAND READY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS THE STERLING OUR LAST PRESENTER TODAY'S TRISTEN BROWN WHO'S A LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WELCOME MR BROWN. THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA AND MEMBERS- GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL I WILL BE- MY MAKING MY BEST ATTEMPT TO BE BRIEF. WE AGREE WITH SO MUCH THAT HAS BEEN SAID TO DAY AND NEED TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE GOVERNOR AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE L. A. ON THE CD HAVE BEEN. HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS WE KNOW THIS IS NO EASY FEAT. AND REALLY RESPECT THE WORK THAT IS GOING ON AND ESPECIALLY WITH- THE DEPARTMENT OF BAD FOR REACHING OUT FOR COMMENT. WE DID SEND IN A RATHER LONG LETTER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REGARDING THE NEW GUIDANCE THAT IS COME OUT THAT POINTS OUT SOME- ISSUES THAT WILL SHARE WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. STEW IS NOT TO BELABOR SOME OF THOSE POINTS- AT THIS HOUR. BUT WE DO WANT BATTERIES THAT. WE MUST HAVE A PLAN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THAT WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH VACCINE AVAILABILITY- AT A POINT WHERE CASE RATES ARE AT A SAFE ZONE AND WHEN ALSO IN CONJUNCTION WITH ICE YOU. CAPACITY WHICH SEEMS TO NOT NECESSARILY BE IN EVERY. OR BE A PART OF EVERY QUESTION. MAYBE MANY OF OUR MEMBERS. DESPERATELY YOU WANT TO BE BACK IN THEIR CLASSROOMS THEY MISTER STUDENTS. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT A SAFE RETURN. AND SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPENED WE THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF. OF EDUCATORS AND STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS AND SO FORTH THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HOLD THE SHIP TOGETHER HERE AND WE REALLY RESPECT THE WRK THAT HAS GONE ON. AND YOU TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALL WANT TO GET BACK TO IN PERSON AS FAST. TO DO THAT WE DO HAVE CRITICISMS OF SOME OF THE- BROAD STROKES THAT THE GUIDANCE IS HAS ALWAYS HAD A PART OF IT SINCE AS DAVID MENTIONED WE WERE IN THESE TALKS LAST APRIL OR MARCH. ALL THE FLEXIBILITY REQUIRED TO REALLY TARGET THE NEEDS. IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE. CONGRUENT WITH SCIENCE AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SCHOOL SITE BY SCHOOL SITES. A REALISTIC PLAN TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN THE STUDENTS WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS FIRST. WE AGREED THAT. SUPER BOWL AND ALL THE OTHER NAMES FOR IT SEEMS TO BE A RIDICULOUS TIME TO TALK ABOUT RETURNING TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. OF PACKING FOLKS INDOORS REALLY TAKES DILIGENCE- RIGHT NOW IT'S DANGEROUS TO DO THIS AND WE DO TAKE SOME. ISSUE WITH THE RESEARCH THAT IS OUT THERE AND THAT IS BEING RELIED ON. HOW WE THINK THAT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT CHILDREN CAN BE A SYMPTOMATIC SUPER SPREADERS. AND WE ALSO NOTICE THAT THE CDC IS NOTICING THAT. INFECTION RATES ON FOR CHILDREN ARE ON THE RISE. WE ALSO LOOK AT SOME OF THE NATIONAL DASHBOARDS AND TAKE NOTE THAT TEACHERS IN NEW YORK AND IN TEXAS WHERE THEY HAVE RETURNED IN PERSON. HAVE A HIGHER INFECTION RATE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION AT ONE POINT THIS STATE WAS LOOKED TO AS A RATIONALE FOR OPENING SCHOOLS BECAUSE- WE'RE NOT. HAVING A MORE DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT IN SCHOOLS WERE JUST TESTING THEIR MORE SO OF COURSE WE SEE IT MORE. BUT NOW THAT TEACHERS ARE BECOMING INFECTED IN THOSE AREAS AT A HIGHER RATE THAN GENERAL POPULATION THAT'S A SIGNAL TO US THAT- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AT A TIME LIKE THIS IS NOT THE MOST PRUDENT AND SAFE CHOICE. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT SCHOOLS TO NZXT'S POSITION WE WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS BROADER THAN JUST SAFELY RE OPENING IN PERSON STEMMING AND FLATTENING THIS CURVE THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO. FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR NOW. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT META ANALYSIS OF WHAT CAN BE THE BEST TOOL IN FLATTENING CURVES. KEEPING STUFF FOLKS OUT OF SCHOOLS IS THE NUMBER TWO MOST. EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT. AND SO IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS SOME DISCREPANCY IN HE SCIENCE WHICH- I'M NOT A SCIENCE TEACHER BUT IT SEEMS THAT IF THERE'S QUESTIONS PER THE SCIENTIFIC MODEL IT'S AN UNSETTLED QUESTION AND WE STILL NEED TO FIND ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD. REALLY AGREE WITH THE- CALLS FOR A MORE EQUITABLE WAY TO SPEND THESE DOLLARS. WE THINK WE SHOULD BE TARGETED TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN THE GREATEST NEED AND HAVE INTERVENTION SERVICES RATHER THAN BROAD GRANTS THAT. HELP SOME DISTRICTS AND PUT OTHERS AT ADISADVANTAGE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE HEARING FROM OUR PARTNERS IN MANAGEMENT TODAY THAT- SUPPORT THE FIVE POINT% THREE BILLION IN SUPPORT FOR INTERVENTIONS AND TO GROW THIS AMOUNT AND I THINK WE AGREE WITH THAT. RATHER THAN THESE INCENTIVE GRANTS TO RUSH PEOPLE BACK IN. LET'S CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE STUDENTS WHO NEED HELP THE MOST. AND ALONG THOSE LINES WE'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD BE. FOCUSING A LOT OF ATTENTION ON EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. THEM THERE IS A- LARGE CONCERN FROM PARENTS AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS OF COURSE ARE ALSO PARENTS STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUES. AND THAT THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT LEARNING LOSS. AND I THINK SOMEONE SAID IT PERFECTLY IT'S NOT LEARNING LOSS IT'S JUST WE'RE STUMBLING THROUGH A DELAY. D. THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT CAN HELP FOLKS THAT WHEN STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A GOOD EMOTIONAL BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IMPACTS THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. SO MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT THE TEACHING ISN'T BEING DONE. TO THEM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IN PERSON IS THE MOST OF ACTIVE. BUT THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER HERE. INTERNATIONAL IN A HISTORICALLY UNSAFE TIME FOR US TO BE LIVING. ON THAT WOULD BE IMPACTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCES AS WELL AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE CHILD. WHOLE STUDENTS. AND NOT JUST WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE IN THE CLASSROOM THERE'S MORE TO IT. LASTLY I JUST WANTED TO MENTION IT WAS SAID EARLIER THAT- DISTRICTS AND LOCALS WOULD BAD ALREADY HAVE CBA'S COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. AND WHO ARE ALREADY OPERATING IN SOME FASHION WITH STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS. I MEAN I NEED TO. RE OPEN THAT. THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND I WOULD JUST CAUTION- TO SAY THAT. IS THERE MIGHT BE CBA'S THAT WERE AGREED TO PRIOR TO KNOWLEDGE AND ALSO HAVING THE FORESIGHT TO KNOW THAT THESE INCENTIVE GRANTS MIGHT BE ON THE HORIZON OR WHAT PLANS MAY OR MAY NOT BE. AND SO THOSE THOSE AGREEMENTS- MAYBE STALE IN THE CAR INTO AND WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW AND- WE BELIEVE THAT IF WORKING CONDITIONS DRASTICALLY CHANGE YOU DO NEED TO RETURN TO THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THOSE. SO GIVEN THE OUR AND I KNOW THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS ON AND I DON'T WANT T GET IN THE WAY OF THAT I JUST WANT TO. ITERATE ONE MORE TIME- OUR- SCHOOLS ARE OPEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND VISUALS ARE MAKING THAT HAPPEN WE WANT TO GO BACK TO IN PERSON FEEL AND UNFORTUNATELY. THIS VIRUS HAS NO EMPATHY IT HAS NO REGARD FOR OUR STRUGGLE AND IT POSES THE HEALTH THREAT OF THE CENTURY WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE LONG LASTING IMPACTS OF THIS VIRUS ARE GOING TO BE. RETURNING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WILL TAKE A HISTORIC EFFORTS AND GOVERNMENT ACTION THAT. HONESTLY I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN IN DECADES I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFETIME- BUT PERHAPS MY GRANDFATHER'S. AND INTEL VACCINATION RATES ARE WHERE THEY NEED TO BE.

CENTER LAYERED. I THINK WE'RE STILL GOING TO HEAR A LITTLE FROM THE PUBLIC BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT TESTIMONY'S BEEN POWERFUL IT AND THE REAL QUESTION HERE. IS JUST CONSIDERING HOW WORKABLE. THE ITEM IS IN FRONT OF US AND- THEN I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO CONVERSATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORKABLE. THANK CENTER LAYERED CENTER PAM. SO I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE SOMEONE FOR THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH WE DO YES- SO I GUESS I'LL POST MY FIRST QUESTION TO C. P. H. AND APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO JOIN US. TODAY WE JUST HEARD FROM BOTH THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA JUST A STATION CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS THAT- THERE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE- WHAT'S BEING RECOMMENDED. FOR THE PROGRAM IN TERMS OF WHEN WE BRING PEOPLE BACK WHEN WE BRING OUR CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL COMMUNITY RATE. IS PERHAPS- NOT WELL PERHAPS TO HIDE SAID D. PREVAILED MADE REFERENCE DEEP PURPLE AT CETERA- CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE C. P. H.'S- ROLAND DECIDING WHEN AT WHAT LEVEL AND WHAT THE RISK IS FOR- STUDENTS COME BACK TO SCHOOL BOTH RISK ON HIS HIS STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO THE STAFF- AND THIS DISC AT LEAST THIS CONCERNED AT SIGNIFICANT STERN RAISED BY THE TEACHERS. AROUND THIS ISSUE AND- EVEN MAYBE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT- SOME OF THE- RESEARCH THAT THEY'VE LOOKED AT SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THEM THAT'S WHAT SEEMS TO BE THIS DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED. AND THE CONCERNS OF THE AT LEAST THE TEACHERS THAT INSPECTS OF THIS HEARING. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US DOCTOR BARTEK. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE RECORD- AND I- THERE'S A COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS- THE DATA I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT THE AND I READ CAREFULLY THE- RESPONSE FROM C. F. T. R. ABOUT THAT THE DAY THAT WE CHOSEN- THAT THAT WORKS ARE PRESENTING AS THE AS THE CASE AND I WOULD SAY THAT- IT'S EXTREMELY- THERE'S A LOT OF DATA OUT THERE- THE DATA WE USED AS A RATIONALE FOR THAT- TWENTY FIVE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. IS BASED ON- HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH- GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL AS A PRETTY RECENT ARTICLE OUT OF- PEDIATRICS WHICH IS A ONE OF THE HIGHEST IMPACT- PUBLICATIONS AND THE FIELD I'M LOOKING AT. SCHOOLS IN NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD A HIGHEST CASE RATE ABOUT. TWENTY NINE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY- THAT SHOULD THERE'S VERY IF YOU THE RIGHT MEDICATION STRATEGY IN PLACE AND ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON- MASKING AND JUST WILL DISTANCING- AND HAND WASHING IF THOSE ARE PLACES THAT YOU THEY HAD VERY VERY FEW OUTBREAKS THEY HAD LIKE I FORGET IT'S IN SINGLE DIGITS THE NUMBERS OF TRANSMISSIONS AND THAT IT ON A SCHOOL SETTING. AND THEY HAD- BUT NO CHILD TO STAFF TRANSMISSION. SO THAT DATA IS HOPEFUL FOR A FOR US TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTICE THAT IT HAS TO BE THAT THERE'S MITIGATION STRATEGIES IN PLACE WE CAN'T JUST SAY IT'S SAFE TO RE OPEN- AND JUST DO IT HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU KIND OPEN. IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT MEDICATION STRATEGIES IN PLACE AND JUST A FEW OTHER PIECES OF DATA THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE HIGHLIGHTED ONE WAS- BUT THE IDEA OF CHILDREN BEING SUPER SPIDERS- THE DATE ON THAT IS ALL ABOUT SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS- SYMPTOMATIC- CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN TESTED WHO HAVE HIGHER VIRAL LOADS- AND A CONCERN THERE AND THAT THERE'S A STUDY FROM INDIA ALSO. AGAIN FOCUSED ACTUALLY JUST ON SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS SOME OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE IS THAT ONE OF THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND SYMPTOMS SCREENING WE GOT TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY WE DON'T TALK ABOUT AS MUCH BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE IMPORTANT USEFUL THINGS AND WHEN I READ THOSE STUDIES I SAID GRANT WE HAVE. SOMETHING IN PLACE TO BREAK THAT CHAIN OF TRANSMISSION- AND THEN THE LAST PIECE OF THE CDC. DATA THERE'S- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S INCREASED RATES OF OUR- THIS IS THE END CHILDREN BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE BECAUSE A POPULAR RATES ARE. AND THERE IS ANOTHER STUDY LAST WEEK FROM THE CDC SHOWING THAT THE RATE AND CHILDREN OF THE INCREASE IS THE SAME AS THE POPULATION RATE AND SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND THE YOUNG ADULTS EIGHTEEN TO I THINK I WAS TWENTY FOUR ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SLIGHTLY OLDER AGE RANGE THAT. SLOPE IS ACTUALLY SPEAKER INDICATING THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY ACTIVE TRANSMISSION IN THAT AGE GROUP MORE SO THAN AND OF THE YOUNGER AGE GROUP AND SO THE CDC CONCLUSION IS THAT SCHOOL RE OPENING DID NOT IS NOT DRIVING TRANSMISSION. AND THERE. AT THE END OF THAT REPORT WAS SCHOOL SHOULD BE THE LAST NAMES TO CLOSE AND THE FIRST THINGS TO OPEN. SO THAT DATA TO ME IS ALL VERY IMPORTANT DATA FOR US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW. THAT IT IT IS STILL THE GOAL IS TO DO SAFE. REOPENING AND REASONABLE APPROACHES. OKAY RESHAPE THAT PRESENTATION I GUESS THE ADDED A COUPLE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS THAT NUMBER ONE IS THAT AND I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE STUDIES. IN OUR OWN STATE WE DO HAVE- SUMS SOME SITUATIONS IN WHICH THERE ARE KIDS GOING TO IN PERSON LEARNING PRODUCT PERHAPS MORE IN SOME PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR OTHER PLACES. ARE WE COLLECTING DATA INCLUDING CONTACT TRACING ON ANY OUTBREAKS OF THINGS GOING ON IN SCHOOLS THAT ARE DOING. IN PERSON LEARNING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE- I REALIZE THAT WE JUST ASK THE QUESTION HOPE THAT SINCE THE BAR EDUCATION COULD TELL US HOW WHICH CHOOLS ARE HAVING SCHOOLS ARE OPEN BUT- IT IS THERE SUFFICIENT CONTACT TRACING DATA THAT WE CAN FEEL CONFIDENT. THAT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPEN- THAT. THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THE TRANSMISSION THAT'S HAPPENING AS A RESULT OF THE STATE. STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOL AND I KNOW THIS MAINLY APPLIES TO YOUNGER STUDENTS WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TEENS WERE FOCUSING ON ON THE YOUNGER STUDENTS. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT- SO THERE'S SOME DATA IT'S NOT LIKE I. I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTED- AS YOU KNOW WHEN I CAN FROM MY POSITION AND SAN FRANCISCO LISTENING AND TRYING TO HEAR OTHER OUTBREAKS. I'M NOT HEARING ANY OUTBREAKS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SEMICIRCULAR CISCO DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. MY UNDERSTAND FROM SAN DIEGO IS THEY'RE NOT SEEING OUTBREAKS AND IT'S THE OUTBREAK SINCE THE IN SCHOOL TRANSMISSION THAT WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR AND I THINK THERE'S TWO REASONS LOOK FOR A WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. IS THEIR ON GOING TRANSMISSION WE'RE NOT THAT THAT WERE NOT THAT. THE DATA IS NOT HELPING US TO ANTICIPATE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BE ABLE ABLE TO SEE THAT. AND HEN THE OTHER PIECE THAT. WE NEED TO LEARN IF THIRDS TRANSMISSION WE KNOW WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN ORDER TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. AND OUR TO HAVE EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT THAT'S WHY IT'S HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THESE OTHER- YOU KNOW PLACES IN NORTH CAROLINA RATHER. PUBLICATIONS THAT TELL US YOU KNOW WHAT OF THAT ONE OF THE THINGS TO DO RIGHT- AND THAT THERE ARE SOME CASES FROM THE NORTH CAROLINA PAPERS ARE. BASED BASED OFF WHEN THEY DID HAVE AN OUTBREAK THAT IT WAS RELATED TO PRESCHOOLS NOT MASKING AND SPECIALIZED SITUATIONS WHERE KIDS WERE SITTING REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER WHILE THEY'RE EATING. SO THAT THAT WAS GREAT YOU KNOW LESSONS LEARNED FOR WHAT THEY CAN DO DIFFERENTLY SO- THE ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS. INITIATIVE INCLUDES THAT TRANSPARENCY COLOR FOR EXACTLY THE REASON YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT WE WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW MANY SCHOOLS ARE OPEN AND THEN ALSO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T IS THEIR TRANSMISSION GOING ON OR IS THIS. YOU KNOW HYPOTHESIS PROTEST I PROCESS ALL THE DATA REGISTER NOW THAT SAYS THERE IS VERY LIMITED TRANSMISSION THAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT MEDICATION STRATEGY IN PLACE. WE WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT'S TRUE IN OUR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AS WELL SO I GUESS THAT FIND THE FINAL PART. IS THAT. SO WE HAVE OUR TEACHER EARLY SHOPPER ZENSAR. SAYS SCIENCE THAT. THE HEARING FROM THEM. BETTER REALLY CONCERNED AND DON'T WANT TO REAL. AT THE LEVEL THAT YOU ABOUT. WHAT OF COMMUNITY. HAS BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN. C. P. H. IN NICE IN YOUR VETTING DEPARTED SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM DAN'S- SCHOOL EMPLOYEES- AND WHAT KIND OF DOLLARS GOING ON IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT THE EVIDENCE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK SOME RIGHT TO QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT SOME OF THE STUDIES ETCETERA. THAT WE CAN AT LEAST COME TO SOME GENERAL AGREEMENT ABOUT WHERE WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS- SO- SO KEY AND TO A CERTAIN TIME OF THAT'S FOR YOU TO ANSWER OR FOR THIS- FOR MISTER ALLEN. AND I'M ALSO CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM THE BOTH OF THEM THIS EASTERLING AND MISTER BROWN TERMS OF FLIGHT. COMMUNICATIONS BEEN HAVING IN TERMS OF REVIEWING THIS DATA AND EVIDENCE TO COME TO SOME GENERAL AGREEMENT ABOUT OKAY- NOW PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT THESE ARE THE STANDARDS WE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE REALIZES ALSO THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN IN THE SCHOOLS YOU SAID. THAT PEOPLE THAT THAT THE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES FEEL COMFORTABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND- THE SAID DAVE ALL EVERYONE'S EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO GO BACK AND. AND DOING IN PERSON LEARNING- YOU HAVE A BILL OF SAY ONE OR TWO THINGS WHICH IS THAT I- YOU KNOW HAVING HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS. FOR A LONG TIME NOW WITH- EVEN BEFORE I CAME TO THIS ROLE IN EARLY DECEMBER TALKING JERRY- TEACHERS AND TEACHERS UNIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER SINCE APRIL I THINK THAT THERE'S ONE REALLY IMPORTANT TO SAY WHICH IS THAT I THINK THERE'S- YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDABLE ABSOLUTELY. POSSIBLE ANXIETY AND FEAR. AND SO THERE'S A PART OF THE ISSUES THERE'S DATA AND THEN THERE'S ALSO AN EXPERIENCE OF YOU KNOW BEING PART OF A PANDEMIC AND BEING PART OF ME THAT'S PART OF THE PANDEMIC SO. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO REGARD SOCK ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE PIECES- I. I ACTUALLY HAVE IT ON MY TO DO IS TO REACH OUT TO MISTER BROWN ACTUALLY AND TO OFFER TO TALK TO THE SCIENCE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SHARED AN UNDERSTANDING AND YOU KNOW HAVING THAT CONVERSATION IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND IMPORTANT- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO. KNOW THAT THERE'S DAY PEACE. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE HELPING PEOPLE JUST. GET OVER THE- THAT ALSO ARAMBULA. BUT BUT MAYOR MISTER ON ALSO WANTS TO. TO TRAIN ABOUT THE- EDUCATION. IT JUST TO QUICKLY ECHO THAT IT DID WE- AS A THING MISTER LANE MISTER BROWN- SPIRO OUT OTHERS- CONTEST WHILE WE'VE BEEN SAY NOT REGULAR CONVERSATIONS AND IT STARTED GOING UP JUST REFERENCE BILLS WILL BE CONTINUING ON AS WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION SO JUST JUST THAT WE HAVE HAD THOSE IN THAT THEY WILL BE- OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE CONVERSATION AND KNOWS STOCK BUYBACK NOTED A NEW STADIUM EVENTS COME TO LIGHT A NEW QUESTIONS ARISE HAS NEW HEADLINES COME UP. AND SO IT DOES HAVE TO BE A CONTINUING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU AND WHAT I'M GONNA DR BECAUSE I KNOW SHE HAS TO SO THANK YOU MUCH FOR BEING HERE BUT DR PANDA GERMANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WELL ACTUALLY I WAS HOPING. MIGHT GET A BRIEF COMMENT FROM- THE CATHOLIC TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. NO THAT'S FINE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE DOCTOR BARDIC KNOWS THAT SHE HAS ANOTHER COMMITMENT AND WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH US THANK YOU. GO AHEAD DR PAM. YEAH ACTUALLY FAT IF THERE CAN BE THAT WHAT THE IF BOTH CTA AND CFT COULD ALSO PERHAPS RESPOND AS WELL. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION DOCTOR PAN YEAH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND- HAS BEEN WORKING WITH DR BOB HARRISON WHO'S AN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH DOCTOR SO IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT WERE. PUTTING OUT THERE IS WHAT WE SAY IS UNSAFE WE ACTUALLY WORK WITH WITH THE DOCTOR AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE STANDUP AND GIVES REALLY GREAT DOCTORS CAN DIFFER ON ON ON ON WHAT ON THEIR OPINIONS. AND THEN I'LL POINT TO A MOST RECENT STUDY OUT OF MONTREAL WHICH I THINK IT WAS THE FULL STUDY THAT WE MAY WANT INCLUDED IN THE IN THE DIALOGUE WHICH ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THAT THAT STUDENTS ARE. ARE CAN SPREAD THE VIRUS AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MOST RECENT DATA- AND JUST. I THINK WHAT. IS MOST HELPFUL MOVING FORWARD IS THE IDEA THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WILL HAVE TO REPORT THE DATA BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN TRANSPARENT YOU KNOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OTHER STATES HAVE HAD DATA DASHBOARDS FOR MONTHS. AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT FOR SCHOOLS SO IF THIS NEW POLICY LEADS US TO ACTUALLY SHOWING AND DEMONSTRATING WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDER SCHOOL SITES THAT'S A GREAT THING BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THANK YOU. JUST ADD THAT- DOCTOR. IS COMPLETELY CORRECT THERE IS A- INTENSE AMOUNT OF FEAR IN IT AMONG OUR RANK AND FILE- THINKING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO WORK AND THEN. EITHER NOT COME. HOME OR DIE IN AN I SEE YOU OR YOU KNOW TRUCK WAITING IN LINE FOR AN ICO. AND THAT DOES. THE IMPACT OPINION QUITE A BIT. AS A ORGANIZATION WE'VE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE- TO WORK WITH YOU RESEARCHERS AS WELL AND FIND OUT OTHER INFORMATION THAT'S WHY WE HAD A YOU KNOW FOOT NOTED CITED LETTER- TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH LOVE DICK TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE BECAUSE IT IS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM CTA STATES IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE. YOU CAN ASK TO DOCTORS AND I'M A LAWYER BY ALL MEANS I KNOW YOU CAN ASK TWO PEOPLE QUESTION YOU GET TO A DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND I IT'S REFRESHING TO KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENS IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AS WELL PERHAPS- BUT- TO THAT. TO THAT DEGREE YOU KNOW WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ARE TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND JUST NOW I AM NOTICING THE SACRAMENTO BEE. IS REPORTING THAT THERE ROSA ROSEVILLE- SCHOOLS HAVE HAD TO A QUARANTINE AND HUNDREDS OF. STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO QUARANTINE BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO GO BACK. TRIED TO PLAY SPORTS. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BEST LAID PLANS AND WE UNDERSTAND THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT ARE PART OF THESE PLANS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOUNG STUDENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT POPULATIONS OF. MAYBE YOU KNOW THE OLDER SO I KNOW WHEN I TALK ABOUT OLDER STUDENTS COMING BACK YET. BUT IT'S A GENERATION OR AGE GROUP RENOWNED FOR- BUCKING THE- ESTABLISHMENT GUIDANCE AND SO THERE ARE GOING TO BE. LARGE LEAKS THERE ARE GOING TO BE MASS TRANS MISSIONS WE BELIEVE WHEN YOU BRING. SO MANY FOLKS BACK TO SCHOOL TO GO BACK TO SO MANY HOUSEHOLD TO INTERACT IN SO MANY WAYS IT'S A COMPOUNDING ISSUE AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT. AND TO SENATOR CORTEZ HE'S- SENTIMENT. THAT'S IT. LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE PUTTING. OUR HORSES IN FRONT OF CARDS USE THE METAPHOR YOU'D LIKE BUT ITSEEMS TO PICK A DATE AND SAY NO WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK- IS NOT THE BEST STRATEGY WHEN LIVES ARE AT STAKE- SO IT SEEMS TO ME- THAT AND AGAIN I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC. TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRED AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL. THINK LEADING MYSELF WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOUR KIDS BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL- IN PERSON LEARNING I THINK IT'S GOING TO IS AND I THINK IT WAS EXPRESSED THIS IS. ONLY GONNA BE BETTERED AND DISTANCE LEARNING ON AVERAGE- BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT. WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE OUR GROUND WORK. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MOVE THIS TRIAL PROPOSAL BECAUSE IF THE TEACHERS ARE TELLING US LIKE OKAY WELL WE HAVE AND WHERE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT THERE YET IN TERMS OF OUR EXAMINATION THE DATA AND I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT I DON'T THINK THE TEACHERS ARE JUST MAKING THIS UP THERE. THEY HAD THEIR CONSULTING THEIR OWN EXPERTS AND SO FORTH. WE NEED TO GET TO SOME KIND OF CONSENSUS WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO BUILD THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT AS WELL THAT THE CAPACITY TO COMMUNICATE. BUT ALSO AND THEN WE HAVE AN EVEN START TALKING ABOUT COMMUNICATING PARENTS AS WELL SO WE'RE TO. TALK ABOUT THE EMPLOYEES AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE. THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT AND KIND OF SORT OF NARROWLY MORE FOCUSED ON THE TESTING PIECE OFIT BUT- EVEN FEEL LIKE EVEN JUST FOR THAT PARTICULAR COMPONENT. THAT- I'M SURE WE'RE I MEAN BY HERE WE FOR SHE- IT FOR. AND SO FORTH BUT I AM NOT. THAT FEELING THAT CONFIDENT THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY SET PEOPLE UP FOR SUCCESS IN TERMS TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE KIND OF SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE THEY WOULD NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY. DO THAT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT. WE JUST HEARD FROM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT THAT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE THAT TESTING IN THAT OTHER PIECES IF WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP SAFELY EVEN AT THE STANDS THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO ALL THE PIECES DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY'RE QUITE QUITE COME TOGETHER YET. AND AND MAYBE- THE L. MAYBE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND COME BACK AND TELL US TELL ME HOW WRONG BUT- AT LEAST ONE MONTH HEARING IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ALL THE PIECES ARE DOT AND THAT THAT'S- THAT'S- JUST. CONCERNING TO ME. AND THEN THAT THAT EVEN TALKING ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD USE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS OR WHATEVER OTHER FUNDS JUST IN TIME TO TRY TO MAKE THIS THING GO. THANK YOU.

STAYS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ON ACHIEVING THESE GOALS HOWEVER- TSA IS DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT NON CLASSROOM BASED PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE RE OPENING GRANT FUNDING. WE WOULD AGREE WITH SENATOR GLAZERS THIS EXCLUSION IS INEQUITABLE TO MANY NON CLASSROOM BASED PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE PROGRAMS THAT UTILIZE SIGNIFICANT ON MY ON SITE INSTRUCTION TYPICALLY TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH THE CUTE NEEDS- WE HAVE HAD PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE. THEIR PARTNERSHIP- BUT WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THEIR RATIONALE FOR EXCLUDING THE SCHOOLS WELL IT'S TRUE MANY OF THE SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO ADAPT TO ONLINE LEARNING MORE QUICKLY IT DOES NOT NEGATE THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOLS FACE THE SAME RE OPENING CHALLENGES THAT TRADITIONAL SCHOOL SPACE TESTING PP AND ADDITIONAL SAFETY PROTOCOLS WILL BE CHALLENGING FOR OUR NON CLASSROOM BASED PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEREFORE WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD NOT THEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE FUNDING PROPOSAL YEAH YES THEY BELIEVE ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO PROVIDE ON SITE INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ITS STAFF AND STUDENTS. WE THEREFORE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE EXCLUSION OF NON CLASSROOM BASED PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS BE STRICKEN FROM THE DROP LANGUAGE SO THAT ALL SCHOOLS THAT OTHERWISE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ONLINE ON SITE INSTRUCTION CAN BE ELIGIBLE FOR RECEIVING FUNDS.
