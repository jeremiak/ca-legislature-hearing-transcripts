00:33:58.236 --> 00:33:59.737

CERTAINLY SAY. THAT I THINK I

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:05.777
THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED

ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND THE WHOLE

SYSTEM NEEDS A REHABBING AND I

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:15.787
THINK THIS IS A WAY TO BE ABLE

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:17.355

BUT COULD NEVER MOVE VERY FAR

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:34.572
WAS. THE IDEA OF A BED REGISTRY

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.073
ACTUALLY KNOWING OR PSYCHIATRIC

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.775

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:44.615

00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:19.016
RATHER THAN THE POLICY THAT

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.885
THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.020

BASED ON THAT PLEASE. WHICH IS

00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:35.132

VERSIONS IN THIS BILL- OVER THE

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.876
PAST YEARS HAVE BEEN THE

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:46.043
ORIGINAL VERSIONS NEVER

HEALTH FACILITIES SO I DO HAVE

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:51.315
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOLLOW UP

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:53.251
ON MY- CALLING FROM STOCKTON'S

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.753
COMMENTS WHICH- I THINK WE HAVE

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.223
THE SAME CONCERN MAYBE NOT AT

00:35:59.290 --> 00:35:59.790
THE SAME LEVEL BUT THE SAME

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:03.027
CONCERN. I AS OPPOSITION STATED

AND THEN YOUR RESPONSE WAS IS

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:05.796
THAT- IT WOULD SEEM TO BE

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:08.132
PURELY BUDGETARY. I DO HAVE TO

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.468
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I WE HAVE

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:11.802
LIMITED BEDS IN KERN COUNTY

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:16.407
COUNTY. AND IF THIS BILL PASSES

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:17.975
WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:19.143
BILL I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IN

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.444
THE FIRST PLACE I THINK IT'S A

00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:21.779
GOOD BILL I DON'T THINK PEOPLE

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.648
SHOULD BE. REQUIRED TO PROVE

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:25.049
THAT PAYMENT SOURCES BEFORE

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.484
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TREATED.

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:27.618
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.554
WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.855
I HAVE DOCTORS THAT TALKED TO

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.456
ME- ALL THE TIME AND

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:33.658
ASSEMBLYMEMBER FALLING ALL THE

00:36:33.724 --> 00:36:36.027
TIME ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:36.661
FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS NOT BEING

ABLE TO PROVIDE MEDICATION.

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:39.163
BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE TO GO TO

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.966
KING COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH- THE

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:43.668
QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS THAT-

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:45.670
IS THERE A CONCERN THAT IF THIS

00:36:45.736 --> 00:36:47.405
BILL. PASSES AND IT WRAPS

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:49.173
AROUND. THE PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.641
FACILITIES INCLUDED IN THE

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:51.342
COUNTIES WHERE THE COUNTY

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.678
SERVICES CONCERN IN ONE PART OF

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.646
IT IS BUDGETARY. BUT I THINK

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.448
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS THAT

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:59.584
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS AND-

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.786
INDIVIDUALS OF PRIVATE PAY. MAY

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:03.287
BE ABLE TO PUSH OUT OR USE

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:06.223
BEDS- THAT ARE OF LIMITED

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.226
SPACE. AS WE KNOW NOW- THAT FOR

00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:13.764
MEDICAL. YOU KNOW MEDICATIONS.

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:14.332
SO I'M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE A

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:15.466
COMMENT ON THAT. ONE OF THE

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:17.335
CLARIFY IF I COULD- THERE ARE

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.936
NO TRANSFERS IF THERE IS NO

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:20.438
BAD. YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF ME

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:22.139
THERE IS NO TRANSFERRED IF

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:23.908
THERE IS NO BED SPACE

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:26.010
AVAILABLE. THAT'S THE ONLY

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.478
REASON THERE'S A TRANSFER IS

00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:29.747
THERE'S AN OPEN BED AVAILABLE.

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:32.083
AT THAT POINT WE SIMPLY. WANT

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:35.853
THEM TO SELECTED WITHOUT

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.555
LOOKING AT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY.

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:39.624
I APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS MY

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.058
UNDERSTANDING IS IT LIKE WE

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:42.593
HAVE ONE SIXTEEN BED FACILITY

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.128
AND LET'S JUST SAY THAT. EIGHT

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:45.096
BEDS ARE FILLED WITH PRIVATE

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:46.364
PAY AND EIGHT BEDS ARE FILLED

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.833
WITH- WITH- INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:50.901
HAVE THEIR OWN HEALTH PLAN. IN

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.103
THE COUNTY CALLS AND SAYS WE

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:54.138
HAVE A PERSON ON ME TO MEDICAL

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:54.639
OR WHATEVER THEY SAY TO

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:58.009
TRANSFER A BED. I THINK THAT-

00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:03.280
REQUIRING THIS COULD. YOUR

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:04.915
DOCTOR OR AN EMERGENCY ROOM

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:07.485
DOCTOR AND DOCTOR PAN IS ALSO A

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:10.187
PHYSICIAN- SO I'M JUST TRYING

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:12.156
TO CONVEY- THE CONCERNS THAT I

00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:13.891
HAVE THAT MY COUNTY HAS SHARED

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:16.260
WITH ME AND YOU SEE NO. ISSUES

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.329
WITH THAT WHATSOEVER OF SPACE

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:19.730
BEING FILLED UP WITH OTHER THAN

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.399
MEDICAL PATIENTS FOR. COUNTY

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:23.834
PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER AND WE USE

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.569
YOUR EXAMPLE IF WE COULD YOU

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:28.072
HIGHLIGHTED SIXTEEN. PEOPLE TO

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.740
FEEL SIXTEEN BEDS THERE WOULD

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:32.176
BE NO OPEN SPACE FOR A TRANSFER

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:34.679
TO GO TO THAT FACILITY. NOW IF

00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:36.180
THERE HAPPENS TO BE AN OPEN

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.616
SPACE I THINK. THE BILL THAT'S

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.317
BEFORE YOU TODAY WOULD SIMPLY

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:42.153
ASK THAT THAT SPACE NOT BE

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.088
JUDGED BASED ON THEIR ABILITY

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.390
TO PAY. BUT SIMPLY SEE IT AS A

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:48.325
HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE DUE TO THE

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:52.196
EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:54.265
THAT THEY'RE IN. I AGAIN AND

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:55.700
MAYBE I'M JUST MISLEAD MISSING

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:56.434
AND I DON'T MEAN TO KEEP

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.103
CIRCLING BACK I AGREE. I AGREE

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.304
THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED%

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.973
ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THE

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.608
BILL BEFORE ME I UNDERSTAND AND

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:05.676
I AGREE WITH THAT AS A MTTER

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:06.911
OF FACT I'VE- VOTED FOR IN THE

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:08.913
PAST. BUT THIS NEW CONCERN WITH

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:10.848
THE HEIGHTS- PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:14.418
FACILITIES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT.

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:16.087
IF SECRETARY HEALTH FACILITIES

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:19.023
WERE NOT IN THERE THEN- IT'S MY

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.257
UNDERSTANDING THAT MEDICAL

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:22.226
PATIENTS WOULD BE PLACED THERE.

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:24.295
AND NOT SO MUCH A PRIVATE PAYER

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:24.895
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE THEY

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.831
WOULD GO TO. AN OTHER

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:28.933
FACILITIES OTHER THAN COUNTY

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:29.567
PROVIDED FACILITIES IS THAT NOT

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.969
TRUE. I'M NOT SURE I'M TRACKING

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.071
EVERY PART OF YOUR EXAMPLE

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.474
THERE RIGHT. I WOULD- MORE

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.542
LIKELY POINTS TO WHAT DOCTOR

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:40.211
EGGMAN HAD BROUGHT UP WHICH IS

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:43.781
THE LACK OF NECESSARY BEDS FOR.

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:45.750
US AS A STATE TO ADDRESS THIS.

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.785
THUS THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.954
ADMINISTRATION AND THE STATE IS

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.189
PROVIDING TO INVEST INTO THESE

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:53.524
CONTINUANCE OF CARE MAY

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:57.528
SUPPLEMENT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.263
FROM THE POLICY DECISION WHICH

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.665
IS BEFORE US TODAY WHICH IS

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:03.734
SEPARATE AND ALL THE BUDGETARY-

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:06.203
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.005
WE'RE HEARING AS WELL. OKAY I

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.707
GUESS LIKE I SAID THAT IF THE

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:11.075
FACILITY IS FULL WITH PRIVATE

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.476
PAID AND THERE WOULD BE NO ROOM

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:13.744
FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS AND THEN

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.913
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM- ARE

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.681
THEY JUST ALLOWED HER TO REMAIN

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:19.250
IN THE HOSPITAL SO THERE'S NO

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:19.750
TRANSFER THEY STAY

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:21.719
HOSPITALIZED. WHEN I WAS IN THE

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:24.088
E. R. IF I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:25.856
A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE THEY

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.424
WOULD STAY IN THE E. R. INTO WE

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.660
FOUND. THEM THE CARE THEY WOULD

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:31.996
NEED AND REQUIRE. AND OFTEN

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:34.098
TIMES THE EMERGENCY ROOM IS NOT

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:35.566
THE BEST PLACE FOR THOSE WHO

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:37.401
ARE SUFFERING WITH AN EMERGENCY

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:39.403
PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION TO

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.638
LANGUISH IN SET FOR DAYS ON

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:42.540
END. AND BELIEVE THAT IF WE

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.141
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEND

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:45.876
THEM TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.845
BECAUSE OF THAT IS AVAILABLE.

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.413
THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.949
PASSED POLICY. IN THAT VEIN AS

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.918
WELL OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND

00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:55.386
LIKE I SAID I DO AGREE WITH-

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:57.087
MIKE CALLING FROM STOCKTON THAT

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:57.988
BROUGHT THIS UP WE DON'T HAVE

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.824
ENOUGH BEDS. AND I GUESS MY

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.659
CONCERN THE HUGE CONCERN THAT I

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:03.160
HAVE IS I ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:04.161
COUNTIES THAT FEEL LIKE IF

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:05.896
THERE'S- SIXTEEN BEDS AND

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:07.031
THEY'RE ALL TAKEN BYPRIVATE

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:08.732
PAY THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE. ANY

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:11.001
ROOM FOR THOSE THAT- DON'T HAVE

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:12.870
THE ABILITY TO PAY AND THAT'S A

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:15.439
CONCERN THAT I HAVE AS WELL- I

MENTAL HEALTH BED IN WHICH TO

PAYMENT FOR THE SERVICE.

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:14.178
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE FAIL

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:15.612
TO DO OUR JOB IN THE STATE BY

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:16.980
PROVIDING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER

00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:18.382

COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:50.547
OKAY SEEING NONE- COUPLE

00:45:50.614 --> 00:45:51.949
ACTUALLY DOES NOT MAKE A COUPLE

00:45:52.015 --> 00:45:54.651
POINTS AS WELL AND AGAIN-

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:55.886
REALLY PUT US A MEMBER OF

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:56.920
RANDALL  DOCTRINE BUT REALLY

APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS

00:45:58.322 --> 00:45:59.156
BILL FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS NOT

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:01.024
THE FIRST TIME. I DO WANT TO

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:03.894
CLARIFY THAT- I THINK THERE MAY

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:04.428
HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:07.264
EARLIER AND THE DIALOGUE THAT.

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:08.532
PREVIOUS VERSIONS AS WELL THIS

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.234
VERSION INCLUDES THE COUNTY

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.802
PSYCHIATRIC- HEALTH FACILITIES

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:12.970
ARE SO SOMETIMES KNOWN AS

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:15.439
PUFFS- IN FACT THE HOSPITAL

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:17.241
ASSOCIATION- BECAUSE IT

00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:19.676
INCLUDES THOSE IS- IT IS NOT

00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:21.211
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL PREVIOUS

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.246
CASES THEY HAVE ACTUALLY OPPOSE

00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:23.447
BILLS WHICH DID INCLUDE THOSE

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:25.115
PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES

00:46:25.182 --> 00:46:26.850
THE ONES THAT. I THINK THE

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:28.051
ROUTE DIRECTORS ASKING TO

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:29.586
ACTUALLY REMOVE SITES ONE MAKE

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:31.221
THAT CLEAR. YES I THINK THERE

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:32.656
WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:34.057
HOSPITALIZATION AND THEIR

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.692
POSITIONS SO MY UNDERSTANDING

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:36.660
IS THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION'S

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:37.828
POSITIONS THEY NEED TO BE

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:40.731
INCLUDED- WHICH IS THE LOCUS OF

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:43.167
THE OPPOSITION- I WOULD ALSO

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:44.768
SAY IS THAT. IT IS AND THAT HE

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:47.471
WAS POINTED OUT BY- BY- CENTER

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.706
ADMIN AND ALSO SENT A ROSTER

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:51.441
THAT. YOU KNOW WE AND ALSO

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:53.110
CENTER AROUND LOW I MEAN UP THE

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:53.977
FINAL PROBLEMS WE DON'T HAVE

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:55.946
ENOUGH BEDS. THE QUESTION THEN

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:58.382
IS THAT WHEN THERE IS A BED

00:46:58.448 --> 00:47:00.551
OPEN DO YOU JUST HOLD IT OPEN

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:02.452
BECAUSE- THE PERSON DOESN'T

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.921
HAVE THE RIGHT INSURANCE AND I

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:05.822
GET IT. THE COUNTY'S. CREATED

00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:07.224
THE SIXTEEN BED FACILITY IS TO

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:08.392
BE SURE WE COULD BILL MEDICARE

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.160
RIGHT BECAUSE THE MEDICAL RULES

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:11.495
YOU CAN'T SOMETHING LARGE AND

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:13.363
SIXTEEN BEDS. AND SO- YOU KNOW

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:14.932
AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:17.834
THAT WELL IS THIS PATIENT ME

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:19.570
NOT NECESSARY HAVE MEDIC COW.

00:47:19.636 --> 00:47:20.504
WHO COULD GO TO ANOTHER

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:21.538
FACILITY BUT THOSE FACILITIES

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:22.940
ARE FULL NOW AND UP IN OUR

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:25.008
FACILITY. NOW THERE'S NO BAD

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:27.678
LEFT AT ALL. BUT YET THEY'RE

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:30.614
NOT USING IT. AND YES WE DON'T

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:37.654
KNOW WHEN SOMEONE MIGHT NEED.

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:38.222
THAT BAD IN THE FUTURE BUT-

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:38.855
THEN THE ISSUE DOWN TO I THINK

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:39.890
CENTER. THE SCHOOL THIS IS THAT

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:40.724
ARE WE JUST HOLD. END OF

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.659
SHORTAGE OF HOLDING. FOR SOME

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.795
TIME ON CERTAIN. WAITING FOR

00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.330
SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY MEETS THE

00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:48.031
BILLING QUALIFICATIONS INSTEAD

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:49.533
OF ACTUALLY PROVIDING CARE TO

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.201
SOMEONE WHO TRULY NEED STATS.

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:53.237
AND CERTAINLY I THINK WELL IT

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:56.139
AND I THINK- DO YOU- THAT. YOU

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:57.074
KNOW WE PROBABLY NEED TO

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.842
CONVERT ALL WE NEED MORE BEDS-

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.410
I THINK CENTER ADMISSION AT THE

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:02.879
CASE OF LEGISLATION FOR

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:03.447
REGISTRY SO WE HAVE A BETTER

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:05.816
SENSE- AND DEAL AND DESPITE

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:06.984
TRANSFERS UP TO HAVE TO TAKE

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.986
PLACE BUT FUNDAMENTALLY I THINK

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:11.255
THE POLICY ISSUE IS THAT-

00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:12.556
SHOULD SOMEONE BE ABLE TO GET A

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:14.057
BED IF THERE'S A BAD THAT'S-

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:16.193
OPEN OR DO WE SIMPLY SAY NO WE

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.095
CAN DO A- CENTRALLY I.

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:19.196
INSURANCE CHECK AND IF YOU'RE

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:20.731
AN IRONICALLY IF YOU'RE NOT IN

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:21.765
THAT ACCOUNT USES THE OTHER WAY

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.300
AROUND. YOU'RE NOT MEDICARE YOU

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:25.035
CAN GET THE BAD AND- THEREFORE

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:27.537
