FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE WHICH WOULD ENSURE PARENTS KNOW WHAT COBIT SPREAD LOOKS LIKE IN SCHOOL SO THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CHILD AND THEIR FAMILIES. SPECIFICALLY SB FORTY NINE SEVENTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOLS TODEVELOP A COVERT NINETEEN TESTING PLAN THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA BAR PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE ENSURES THAT SCHOOLS PRE SCHOOLS AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND CHILD CARE CENTERS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE TESTING PLANTS. C. PAGE HAS WORKED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC FUTURE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE GOOD TESTING GUIDES TO SUPPORT BUT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO REQUIREMENT FOR A PLAN WELL PLAN IN PLACE SCHOOL SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY LEAVE PARENTS IN THE DARK. PARENTS SHOULD LET PARENTS NOT SCHOOLS SHOULD LET PARENTS KNOW THAT THERE ARE POP OF CODE CASES JUST LIKE THEY DO WAY AND THEIR CHILD EXPOSED OTHER TRANSMISSIBLE CONDITIONS FOR EXAMPLE I CAN PLACE. WHEN WELL VACCINES ARE GREATEST WEAPONS AGAINST. THE PARTICULAR GETS COVER NINETEEN WE NEED ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE SCHOOL CLOSURES CASE SEARCHES. AND PARENTS ARE WELL INFORMED SO WE NEED TO STOP THIS HEALTH RSKS TO CHILDREN ACTUALLY SCHOOLS STUDENTS. HAVE BEEN NINETEEN RANKS AMONG THE TOP TEN LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH WERE AGES FIFTY FIVE TO FOURTEEN OF FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN FACT OVER A THOUSAND CHILDREN AGES SEVENTEEN AND UNDER HAVE DIED OF KOBE IN NINETEEN. BUT THAT PERSPECTIVE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED KIDS DIED OF CANCER EVERY YEAR WE MUST NOT DISMISS THE EFFECTS OF COBIT IN CHILDREN. FURTHER WE KNOW TESTING HELPS PREVENT SCHOOL CLOSURES BRAG SCHOOL CLOSURES HAVE TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT TOLL ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF STUDENTS PARENTS AND TEACHERS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. SO SCHOOL OPENING AND CLOSURES. MUST HAVE CONCRETE TESTING PLANS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE IN PERSON LEARN. THE SAFE IN PERSON LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. FINALLY SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE WOULD SURE THAT THE COPA NINETEEN TESTING EQUITY. ACROSS THE STATE PROVIDING ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO TESTING AND PROVIDING BETTER DATA FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS EQUITY IN TESTING ALSO ALLOWS FOR BETTER PARENTAL TRANSPARENCY BEGAN PARENTS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THEIR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A SERIOUS DISEASE. SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING OUR SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO STAY OPEN AND HELP PREVENT FUTURE SURGES A COVE IN NINETEEN. WE ASK FOR AYE VOTE AT TWO WITNESSES PRESENT TO US AND TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT GREAT THANK YOU CENTER PAN ALL RIGHT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE. PAULA VIA THE VS GAS AND WE ALSO HAVE ABIGAIL STODDARD IN GREAT THAT YOU'RE BOTH HERE IN PERSON- PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND BEGIN YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR. MY NAME IS PAULA VAZQUEZ AND I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE. I'M A PROUD SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I'M HERE ON MY OWN BEHALF. AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I UNDERSTAND TRUST THAT PARENTS PLACE IN SCHOOLS TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN SAFE. I ALSO UNDERSTAND VERY CLEARLY THAT COVERT NINETEEN. CAN BE A SERIOUS DISEASE ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN. THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL DISTRICT IN KEEPING SCHOOLS OPEN. KEEPING STUDENTS LEARNING AND RETAINING THE TRUST OF THE FULL SCHOOL COMMUNITY ARE THOSE WITH PLANS TO TEST FOR COVERT NINETEEN. SAN JUAN UNIFIED WAS AMONG THE FOR LARGE DISTRICTS TO HAVE CODES. WILL CITE. THIS EARNED US THE TRUST OF PARENTS WHO KNEW. THAT WE TOOK THE SAFETY OF THEIR CHILDREN SERIOUSLY. ONCE WE RETURNED IN PERSON LEARNING. OUR ATTENDANCE RATE NEVER DIPPED BELOW SEVENTY PERCENT. WHEREAS IN MANY OTHER SCHOOLS ATTENDANCE DIPPED BELOW FIFTY PERCENT. HAVING SCHOOL TESTING PLANS AND RESOURCES IS A KEY TOOL TO MAINTAINING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SAFELY. AND WILL CURB THE SPREAD OF COVERED NINETEEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN FACT A REPORT OF OVER TWO HUNDRED CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. FOUND THAT ONSITE RAPID COVERT NINETEEN TESTING CONTRIBUTED TO THE SAFETY OF IN PERSON LEARNING AND BUILD CONFIDENCE IN SCHOOL SAFETY FOR PARENTS AND STAFF. CONFIDENT HAVING THEIR CHILL CHILD RETURNED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BECAUSE OF CODE TESTING PROGRAMS AT THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL. AND 87% OF PARENTS REPORTED THAT COVERT TESTING AT THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL HELPS KEEP THEIR FAMILY SAFE. IN SCHOOLS WITH WEEKLY TESTING IN SCHOOL TRANSMISSION WAS REDUCED BY AS MUCH AS FIFTY PERCENT. AND PARENTS CONFIDENCE IN SCHOOL SAFETY WAS INCREASED. I'M THANKFUL TO DR PAM AND THE LEGISLATIVE VACCINE WORKGROUP FOR MARSHALLING THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT. OPEN AND SAFE SCHOOLS FOR KIDS AND STAFF DURING THE PANDEMIC I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT UP WE GO TO OUR NEXT WITNESS LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR LEYVA HERE LEYVA HERE OTRO A VOGUE. A TROUBLED HERE CORTESE. VALLEY VALLEY HERE GLAZER. MCGUIRE PAN. PAN HERE EXCELLENT THANK YOU MA'AM CONSULTANT ART WE WILL PROCEED AND YOU ARE ABIGAIL STODDARD PLEASE PROCEED YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ABIGAIL STODDARD. I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER OF GOVERNMENT PUBLIC PROGRAMS A PRIMARY HEALTH. PRIMARY BEGAN AS A VOLUNTEER EFFORT SERVING THE COMMUNITY OF BELIEVE. YEAH IN THE EARLY DAYS DEPLOYED TO SERVE FOR CAL. TO MAINE BUT IT'S A DELAWARE AND TOGETHER WE'VE DELIVERED IT NEARLY TEN MILLION COBRA TESTS NATIONWIDE. I'M HERE TODAY TO IN SUPPORT OF SENATORS PAN BILL SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE. OF IT I'M NOT HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT MY COMPANY ANY TESTING TECHNOLOGY LAB CAPACITY OR TREATMENTS. TODAY ONLY ONE IMPRESSED UPON THE COMMITTEE THE IMPORTANCE OF PREPAREDNESS AND PLANNING FOR SCHOOLS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. OF MY NO MY TIME TODAY IS SHORT SO I'LL ILLUSTRATE MY POINT WITH ONE SINGLE TREND. THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS IN ROLLING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH RAPID TESTING PROGRAM OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WE HAD ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN OUR RAPID TESTING PROGRAM. IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS HOWEVER THE PROGRESSION OF THE DELTA VARIANTS AND EMERGENCE OF THE OMICRON VARIANT. FLIP THE SWITCH FOR MANY SCHOOLS FROM NO TESTING PLAN TO NEEDING TO IMMEDIATELY ENROLL IN A PLAN IN ORDER TO AVOID CLOSING THEIR DOORS. WHEN CONCEPT WITH THE PEAK. SEARCH AND MAP. CPA SCHOOL INDUSTRY STAFF WERE FURIOUS TO ENROLL OVER FIVE HUNDRED BRAND NEW SCHOOLS IN THE SHORT MONTHS OF DECEMBER ALONE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COVERT PROGRAM RELIES ON TRUST COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES. OUR SCHOOL TEAMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PULL OFF A HERCULEAN EFFORTS THIS YEAR RESPOND AND PREVENT SCHOOL CLOSURES BUT THE CYCLE IS SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE SPIDERS BUILD% TO BREAK THIS CYCLE OF ZERO TO SIXTY THAT EXACERBATES A STATE OF CRISIS AND PUTS THE HEALTH OF SCHOOL COMMUNITIES AT RISK. A SIMPLE RESPONSE PLAN PUT IN PLACE BEFORE IT IS NEEDED AND COMMUNICATED TO STUDENTS FAMILIES AND PARENTS IS AN INVESTMENT IN THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. OF FAMILIES.

IF TESTING PLANS HELP SCHOOLS TO STAY OPEN THE DEBATE WOULD BE SOLELY FOCUSED ON IF IT'S WORTH THE COST DESPITE THAT CLAIM FROM THE AUTHOR TESTING AT SCHOOL DOES NOTHING AT BEST ACTUALLY KEEPS KIDS. OUT OF SCHOOL. SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL POINT TO A TESTING CITY OF OVER TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS. OVER A YEAR AGO. THAT'S STUDY SIMPLY SHOWS HOW SAFE IN PERSON SCHOOL IS. IN THE STUDY THE POSITIVITY RATE WAS NEARLY TWO TENTHS OF 1% READER IN THE LOS BRITAIN SCHOOLS AND HOW LITTLE VALUE. ROUTINE TESTING HAS. THERE'S NO CONTROL GROUP AND THERE IS NO INDICATION TESTING HELPER TO SPREAD IN SCHOOLS. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS SCHOOL SURVEILLANCE TESTING PROGRAMS INCREASE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. L. A. U. S. T. TEST EVERY STUDENT STAFF WEEKLY. THE L. A. TIMES RECENTLY REPORTED HALF OF ONLY USD STUDENTS WERE CHRONICALLY ABSENT THE SCHOOL YEAR. LARGELY DUE TO LAUSD IS TESTING AND QUARANTINE POLICIES. THEIR PROGRAM COST FOUR TIMES ORIGINAL BUDGET OF FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. IN THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS COST OVER TWELVE THOUSAND TO IDENTIFY A SINGLE POSITIVE TEST RESULT. AND WOULD COST ABOUT SIX BILLION STATEWIDE MUCH MORE THAN THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION REQUESTED. ALMOST EVERY STAKEHOLDERS. IS NOT SUPPORTING THIS BILL WITH NO SUPPORT FROM TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ADMINISTRATOR ASSOCIATION. IN THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR. AND WOULD. RE INTRODUCE CHAOS. THAT'S IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHTS THIS IS A NEW REQUIREMENT NOT CURRENTLY IN PLACE. MOST SCHOOLS DO NOT COME CLOSE TO WHAT IS IN THE CURRENCY PH TESTING GUIDANCE BECAUSE ONE IT IS NOT REQUIRED.

WHAT IS IN THE CURRENT GUIDANCE FOR ONE SCHOOLS HAVE TO TEST SOME KIDS AS MUCH AS TWICE A WEEK. SEEPAGE COULD CHANGE THE GUIDANCE AT ANY TIME GIVEN SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES MORE WHIPLASH ON TOP OF THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES EACH. HER HIRE AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL STAFF. THE RESOURCES TO FUND THIS BILL WOULD BE MUCH BETTER SPENT ON OTHER PROGRAMS. NEW SOME RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE STATE WOULD BE TERMINATED ITS CONTRACT WITH CITIES TESTING LAB. YES THIS BILL MOVES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION CREATING AN INDEFINITE TESTING PLAN. REQUIREMENTS JUST YESTERDAY THE CDC ANNOUNCED THREE IN FOR USE OF ALREADY HAD GO.

SENATOR BOOK HELLO SENATOR PAN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO YOU'VE BEEN THE COVERED- NINETEEN- SENATOR I WITH YOUR MD AND SO FORTH FIRST OFF THANK YOU FOR. CALLING THE OTHER TWO BILLS THAT HAVE BECAUSE A LOT OF- COMMOTION AND IF YOU CREDIT FOR THAT ON THE ON THE SPRINT ON THIS ONE COMING FROM A SCHOOL PERSPECTIVE- I DO HAVE A XIN. AND- THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT THE L. A. L. E. AS TO DESIGNATE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL AND REPORT ON ITS COVERT NINETEEN TESTING PROGRAM TO THE CDPH. WITH THE EXISTING STAFFING SHORTAGES THAT WERE- EXPERIENCING THROUGHOUT THE STATE AT THIS TIME WILL AT LEAST HAVE THE CAPACITY TO COMPETE WITH THESE PROVISIONS WHAT HAVE BEEN THE FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NO ACTUALLY. WE ARE FEET RECEIVING FEEDBACK FOR THAT- FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE- TESTING PLANS ARE ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN. AND ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ACTUALLY OFTEN COVERT CONTROL ITSELF. AND- UP FROM THE STAFF YEAH WE ARE WORKING ALSO ON A FUNDING AND STATE BUDGET AS WELL AND THAT- TO HELP SUPPORT SCHOOLS BOTH THE TESTING AND THE STAFFING THAT THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT. ITS THANK FOR PAN AM- I HAD IT HERE OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE I'D WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THE STATE HAD IMPLEMENTED OR ALLOCATED TWO TESTING THE CONCERN THAT YOU HAD THE NOT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ACROSS THE STATE HAVE THAT NOW. THE QUESTION THE CONCERN I HAD IS OR ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ARE IS THE FACT THAT. IF THE CDPH DID NOT FIND THIS ARE REQUIRED IF THIS IF DID IN MY END DATE THIS AS A REQUIREMENT TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THEIR THE CDPH- WHY DO YOU FEEL COMPELLED TO. MAKE THIS A MANDATE FOR THE STATE. WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL EVERY CHILD HAS A RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION WE ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL SAFELY. IT'S IMPORTANT PARENTS ACTUALLY KNOW THEIR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN EXPOSED- TO- TO THE SPEAKERS AT SCHOOL. SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ACTUALLY OUR PARENTS NEED TO BE INFORMED YOU HAVE PARENTS TO EITHER CHILD MAY BE VULNERABLE THEMSELVES- THEY MAY HAVE A CHRONIC CONDITION LIKE ASTHMA OR DIABETES- THEY MAY ALSO HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS AT HOME WHO MAY BE AT RISK RIGHT SO. MAYBE THERE'S A- A GRANDPARENT AT HOME OR A BAR OR OTHER OTHER PERSON AT HOME AND SO IT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW IF THEIR CHILD GOT EXPOSED. AND MIGHT BE INFECTED THAT THEY CAN PROTECT THEIR HOUSEHOLD AND TO PROTECT YOUR CHILD THAT'S WHY TESTING PLANS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THAT. WE HAVE THE INFORMATION. THEY NEED TO KEEP THEIR- OF THEIR CHILD AND THEIR HOUSEHOLD SAFE. AND SO TESTING PLANS ARE IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. AGAIN THESE ARE TESTING PLANS CONSISTENT WITH A CALIFORNIA PART PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH OF COURSE IS. IT IS IT CAN BE JUST WILL BE ADJUSTED BASED ON THE CASELOAD IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL SO. I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE PERCEIVE THAT. THE TESTING PLAN IS GOING TO BE JUST ONE FIXED PLANNED IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S A IT'S A DYNAMIC SITUATION WHICH- WAS REALLY TO THE NEEDS OF THAT INSURING THAT WE KEEP. OUR CHILDREN SAFE AND ALSO COMMITTEE SAFE. BECAUSE THANK YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER PAN AS A FORMER SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD MEMBER I'M ALWAYS VERY- LARRY AND STATE REQUIREMENTS SPECIALLY WHEN THE CDPH DOES NOT IRATE I'M JUST GONNA I'M A LITTLE HESITANT TO BE HONEST AND I WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE SUPPORTING ACTION WILL BE SUPPORT WITHOUT TODAY OKAY HOW DOES FOR THAT BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR LOCAL SKIP SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT PROTOCOLS THAT AB. THE SENIOR- NEEDED FOR THEIR REGION OR FOR THEIR FOR THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE FOR THEM AS WELL AS VACCINES AND SO- I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED- BUT- I AM GRATEFUL THAT THE MONEY'S THERE FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD WISH TO IMPLEMENT. A PLAN AND I TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS YOU DECIDE WHAT WORKS BEST. LOCALLY AND IF THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NOT- FOLLOW PLANNED IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE- A LOCAL PARENTS DISAGREE THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO ADVOCATE FOR WHAT FOR WHAT THEY FEEL IS APPROPRIATE AND NEEDED WITHIN THEIR DISTRICTS. SO I'M NOT I'M NOT FRONT AND THE FACT THAT OF THE IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE LOCALLY I'M GOING TO. NOT SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY SO- ON THOSE GROUNDS BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS. THANK YOU FELLOW CENTER DOLLAR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO. FIRST OFF I WANT TO SAY THAT SOME YOU KNOW I'M HAVING A TIME UNDER WHY THIS THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW UNTIL JANUARY ONE OF THIS THIS IS NOT URGENCY BILL CORRECT. NO SO. JUST YESTERDAY I BELIEVE IT IS OR TODAY YOU KNOW. THE SOUTHEAST ANNOUNCED THAT WE ARE OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. OR OR OR AT MOVING OUT OF PENDING I JUST SAW IT ON CNN ON MY PHONE NOT WHETHER THAT HE'S FLIP OR FLOP AND I DON'T KNOW BUT THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT- THIS BILL IS NOT AN URGENCY BILL SO THIS BILL. BASICALLY GONNA TO COME INTO LAW IN JANUARY SO WHY IT WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON WHY WE WOULD BE WITH YOU IF WE WERE IF WE NEED TO TESTING WE WOULD BE DOING TESTING RIGHT NOW- AND NOT. AND THEN MOVE IT TO JANUARY SO THAT IN AND OF I WON JUST STATE THE FACTS THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTED THIS BILL ALL PEOPLE THAT. MOSTLY ALL PEOPLE WHO MAKE THESE TEST. AND ARE PROFITING OFF OF. THE OF SELLING OF THESE TEST AND THEY KNOW IF WE'RE IF WE MANDATED OUR SCHOOLS. THEY'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY. SO CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS IS ON WHY THIS BILL. IS NOT SET FOR URGENCY BILL IT IF WE WERE IN A PANDEMIC RIGHT NOW WE WOULD NEED TO BE TESTING ARE. OUR CHILDREN. SO FIRST OF ALL- CENTER DOLLY THOUGHT THE RESPECT. THOSE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THIS BILL ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE PROFITING. FROM TESTING. AND I FIND IT DISAPPOINTING THAT YOU WOULD LEVEL THAT KIND OF ACCUSATION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIST OF SUPPORTERS MOST OF THE SUPPORTERS VAST MAJORITY OF SUPPORTERS ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO WOULD IN ANY WAY PROFIT. PACKAGES ENOUGH MANY OF OUR PEOPLE- TALK ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WE HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. AND YET YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT THEY SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS SAFE TO KEEP THE KIDS SAFE AND ALSO BECAUSE PARENTS WANTED. AND WE ALSO OUGHT TO MAKE NOTE THAT MANY YOUTH ORGANIZATION SUPPORT THIS BILLS WELL. SO THE VERY STUDENTS THEMSELVES SOME OF WHOM OF ACTUALLY PROTESTED AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE ACTING. STRONGLY ENOUGH- SO I WOULD SET ITSELF I WOULD SAY IS THAT- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD HAVE TO STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH WHAT YOU'VE SAID THAT CONTENTION. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- YES IT WOULD NOT ACTUALLY- THE BILL ITSELF WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT JANET FIRST. UNTIL J. FIRST TWENTY THREE WOULD SIGN. PASSED AND SIGNED THE LAW. HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T I THINK IT'S- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY IN FACT MANY TIMES WE HAVE BILLS THERE'S THAT MAYBE SOME IMPLEMENTATION. TIME AS WELL AND SO WEAK THAT THERE WOULD BE. THAT TIME FOR FIRST FOR GUARANTEED TO DO THE WORK BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT- THAT. BUT IT WAS BEEN FOLLOWING KOBE NINETEEN IT IS ACTUALLY A CREDIBLE. SCIENTISTS EPIDEMIOLOGISTS THIS IS SAYING THAT THIS THING'S OVER RIGHT AND BY THE WAY WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING IS ENDEMIC IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OVER EITHER FOR EXAMPLE POLIO IS ENDEMIC. PRIOR TO THE- POLIO VACCINE. I WASN'T EMIC. THAT'S STILL CREATED PROBLEMS FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE HE HAD IT FOR FAMILIES BECAUSE YOUR CHILDREN WHO ARE PARALYZED. AND EVERY SUMMER PARENTS WOULD LIVE IN FEAR ABOUT THEIR CHILD POTENTIALLY BECOMING PARALYZED. BY THIS VIRUS IS ENDEMIC VIRUS. RIGHT YOU KNOW RUBELLA WAS ENDEMIC. BUT IT CAUSED BIRTH DEFECTS IN PREGNANT WOMEN. RIGHT SO WE TAKE MITIGATION MEASURES ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE DISEASE AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WELL CERTAINLY TALK TALK ABOUT DEATH IN MY PRESENTATION IN FACT TOO MANY CHILDREN HAVE DIED. OF CALVIN THAT IS NOT THE ONLY OUTCOME. WHAT WE KNOW NOW. IS THAT RATES OF DIABETES YOU'RE OUT AFTER SOMEONE GETS COBIT. THIS HIGHER. SO YEAH WE DON'T DO WE WANT MORE CASES DIABETES WE KNOW RATES OF HEART DISEASE ARE MUCH HIGHER AFTER SOMEONE GETS CODED. WE'VE SEEN RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS BRAIN DAMAGE. AND PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD COATED AND DILATES NOT JUST SEVERE BECAUSE OF IT IT'S EVEN MILD COATED. SO LONG COVE IT OTHER TYPES OF POST CODE SYMPTOMS THESE ARE IMPORTANT- THAT WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO OF COURSE WE NEED FURTHER RESEARCH TO BETTER DEFINE IT WE HAD A WHOLE HEARING ABOUT IN THEIR HEALTH COMMITTEE. BUT I DON'T THINK ONE WANTS TO BE. YEAH THAT CASUAL ABOUT THE IDEA THAT. CHILDREN GETTING INFECTED OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE TO HAVE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD. GETTING INFECTED IS NESTLE GOOD THING NOW. WHAT THE TESTING PLAN DOES IS THAT IT HELPS INFORMS. PARENTS AND FAMILY SO THEY CAN MAKE THEIR OWN JUDGMENTS. IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO DO TO KEEP THEIR- CHILD AND FAMILY SAFE. BUT IF THEY DON'T KNOW. THE SCHOOLS AREN'T HELPING. BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE CHILD SPENDING TIME TO SCHOOL BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THE TALENT BUT AND YOU KNOW AND- YOU KNOW YOUR PET. I'M A PARENT RIGHT. I MEAN I GET NOTES FROM SCHOOL WHENEVER THEY EXPOSE NOT JUST TO COPE IT BUT THE OTHER. YOU KNOW TRANSMISSIBLE THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED EVEN HEADLIGHTS WHICH BY THE WAY HASN'T AS FAR AS I KNOW HAS REALLY TOLD ANYONE. IF YOU DON'T TELL THE PARENTS THAT THEIR CHILD EXPOSED HEADLIGHTS THEY GET UPSET. I USED BY THEIR USED TO BE A- POSITION I WAS A PHYSICIAN CONSULTANT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT BEFORE OF THE LEGISLATURE. OKAY I MEAN  SAW I WAS THE PHYSICIAN CONSULTANT FOR A FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND PARENTS WANT TO KNOW. THAT'S WHAT THEY KNOW THEIR KIDS HAVE BEEN EXPOSEDTO SOMETHING CONTAGIOUS. SO THEY CAN MAKE. SENSE AND SO WHAT THIS TESTING PLAN REQUIREMENT IS THAT TO BE SURE PARENTS KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THEIR KIDS. AND IF THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOMETHING LIKE COBIT EXPOSE THE COBIT BECAUSE COVE IT IS A DISEASE THAT MANY PARENTS TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND THEY SHOULD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PANTHER DOLLY. PUT GO AHEAD I'M JUST GOING TO LET THE COMMITTEE- I HAVE TO PRESENT A BILL IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW I WILL BE OPPOSINGTHE BILL I DON'T KNOW WE'D BE ABLE TO TAKE A VOTE RIGHT SOONER WE PROBABLY DON'T SOMEONE IS GOING TO MAKE A MOTION. WE WILL DO IT LATER IN THE DAY SO YOU'LL HAVE TIME TO VOTE. YOU'RE WELCOME- CENTER PAMELA TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES BUT PART OF THAT I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE QUESTION- THE BILL REQUIRES A TESTING PLAN RIGHT CORRECT OKAY I THINK PEOPLE HAVE CONFLATED THAT THE BILL IS GOING TO REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO MANDATE TESTING. BUT JUST REQUIRING A PLAN I KIND OF THINK ABOUT IT AS NGUYEN- THE PANDEMIC FIRST STARTED AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PP AND SO NOW WE ARE REQUIRING HOSPITALS AND NURSING ASSOCIATIONS AND WHATNOT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE PROPER PP SO TO ME THIS IS ABOUT PLANNING IN THE EVENT WE HAVE ANOTHER PANDEMIC- AND I ALSO JUST WANTED TO NOTE. ALL THAT ARE OFF. FROM PEOPLE OPPOSING THE BILL BUT WE RECEIVE MANY CALLS AT OUR OFFICE FROM PEOPLE IN SUPPORT. ALL THE PEOPLE THAT CALLED IN SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND THEY SAID THEY ARE THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WERE FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADERS SO THE PARENTS CALL THEM. AND THEY SAID THAT THEY FEEL SAFER AT SCHOOL IF THEY CAN GET TESTED FIRST THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING. ALL THE OPPOSITION CAME FROM THE PARENTS WHICH I GET IT I HAVE KIDS I WORRY ABOUT MY CHILDREN TOO. BUT THAT THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY FELT THAT THEY WERE SAFER- BEING TESTED IT MADE THEM COMFORTABLE GOING TO SCHOOL. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS AS THE CHAIR I CANNOT MOVE THE BILL- CENTER PAM IS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. CANNOT MOVE THE BILL BECAUSE HE- THEIR OF THE BILL SO WE WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A MORE MEMBERS- AND SEE IF SOMEONE. MOVES THE BILL SO SENATOR PAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SO- CENTER PAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I HAVE TO GO VOTE IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE. SO SENATOR PAM I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE OVER. AND A SERGEANTS IF YOU CAN CALL OTHER AUTHORS AND ASK THEM TO COME ON OVER THAT WOULD BE GREAT RUN ACROSS THE STREET- ALL RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE NOTIFY- OTHER AUTHORS WHO WISH TO COME AND PRESENT I BELIEVE NEXT UP MAYBE THE CENTERS AS CENTER WIENER BOB A CINNAMON. SO FOR STAFF THEY'RE WATCHING- IF YOU'RE MEMBER HAS A- BILL- AND THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AND THEY WANT TO GET THE PRESENTATION DONE EARLIER NOW IS THE TIME. WE'RE WAITING FOR OTHERS. OKAY THE COMPANY. SO IN THE NEAR THE CHAIR VICE CHAIR HERE SO WE GOT THE WHOLE RUN THE SHOW NOW I. SERAPH WELCOME WELL. IT'S EDUCATION CENTER UP WANT TO COME TO THE SINCE. AND I SEASON FOURTEEN BEHIND BUT I THINK YOU ARE STILL FIRST ON YOUR YOUR FIRST IN THE ROOM AND FIRST ON THE- AGENDA SO ALL RIGHT- SO WILL. NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER SIX S. B. ELEVEN NINETY NINE BY CENTER ROCK WELCOME. THANK YOU. MIKE THANK YOUS THE SUN THANK YOU SIR. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION TO SECURE AN ACUTE CARE TEACHING HOSPITAL IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRAINING YOU SEE OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MEDICAL STUDENTS MEDICAL RESIDENTS AND MEDICAL FELLOWS. AS SOME MAY RECALL MAY RECALL THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS DESIGNED AND ESTABLISHED FOR BUDGETARY REASONS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SCHOOL WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF A DEDICATED UC HOSPITAL- MEDICAL CENTER FOR CLINICAL TRAINING AND EDUCATION TO MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS. TO DATE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN UNDERSTANDING IT ISTHE ONLY UC MEDICAL SCHOOL TO OPERATE. WITHOUT A DEDICATED ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. AS A RESULT THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IS RELIED ENTIRELY ON PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AND CLINICAL FACILITIES IN THE REGION PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FOR PROFIT AND NOT FOR PROFIT. TO TRAIN ITS STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS PROGRAM WITHOUT A DEDICATED YOU SEE TRAINING PLATFORM HAS OF COURSE NOT BEEN OUT BEEN WITHOUT CHALLENGES. CHALLENGES AND CONFLICTS RESULTING IN SOME CASES FROM SOME LOCAL HOSPITALS TERMINATING YOU SEE SPONSORED. RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TO RETAIN MORE OF THE TRAINING REVENUE INDOOR TO REGAIN MORE CONTROL OVER RESIDENT PRODUCTIVITY. IN OTHER CASES LOCAL HOSPITALS AND OWN HOSPITAL RESIDENT THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE UNWELL UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO AUGMENT OR EXPAND. TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL UC. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MEDICINE RESIDENTS ALTHOUGH THIS IS CERTAINLY CAUSE SOME TURBULENCE TODAY THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE HAS BEEN ABLE TO COPE WITH THIS. INSTABILITY IN ITS TRAINING PROGRAM. HOWEVER WITH THE ONGOING CONSTRUCTION OF UCR'S NEW ACADEMIC FACILITY WHICH WILL DOUBLE THE ENROLLMENT OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO FIVE HUNDRED PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING. DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL STUDENT CLINICAL ROTATION SLOTS REQUIRED IN HOSPITAL AND CLINICAL FACILITIES. INCREASE THE NUMBER AND CAPACITY OF ASSOCIATED RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND WITH FURTHER GROWTH ANTICIPATED AS WE HOPE IN THIS MEDICAL SCHOOL THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS WILL RAPIDLY EXCEED THE CAPABILITIES OR EXISTING LOCAL COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AND CLINICAL FACILITIES. THUS IF WE HOPE TO BEGIN TO SOLVE THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SHORTAGE IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SOME EXTENT IN THE STATE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE BEGIN THE PROCESS TO HELP YOU SEE YOUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ESTABLISH A STABLE TRAINING PLATFORM A UC TEACHING HOSPITAL FOR UCR'S MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS. SO AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT TIME I WOULD RESPECTFULLY AS FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- SERA- A NOTE THAT THERE'S NO A LEAD SUPPORT- WITNESS- REGISTERED FOR- TESTIMONY SO WITH AND JUST MOVE HERE TO ROOM TWENTY ONE HUNDRED ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES- PRESENT WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

LEYVA HI LEYVA OHIO CHOI BOGUE. RITUAL BOGART CORTESE. DALLY GLAZER. MCGUIRE PAN HI PAM I. THANK YOU MA'AM CONSULTANT CENTER AYE WIENER YOU HAVE OUR NEXT BILLS WELL SB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- TODAY I'M PRESENTING SPLM FORTY FOR THE SAFE AND EFFICIENT WATER ACT I CALIFORNIA IS A LEADING EXAMPLE FOR THE NATION% IN THE WORLD ON SO MANY ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. HOWEVER OUR DRINKING WATER REGULATIONS DO NOT ALWAYS- PASS MUSTER I KNOW WHERE IS THIS MORE EVIDENT THAN IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS- DATA COLLECTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. SHOW THAT SHOWED THAT 53% OF REPORTING SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOUND LEAD IN AT LEAST ONE OF THEIR DRINKING WATER FOUNTAINS ON CAMPUS OF TRAINING TWENTY ONE HUNDRED DRINKING WATER FOUNTAINS TESTED POSITIVE. FOR LEAD- THIRTEEN HUNDRED- SCHOOLS UNFORTUNATELY THE ISSUE DOESN'T STOP IT LET THE SAME WATER SYSTEMS MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED EXPOSING STUDENTS TO LEGIONELLA RATE I'D AND A HOST OF OTHER POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CONTAMINANTS- THE- HOWEVER THE TESTING THAT BROUGHT THIS DATA TO LIGHT DID NOT REQUIRE TESTING. FOR THESE OTHER NON LEAD- CONTAMINANT ONLY LEAD TESTING WAS REQUIRED WITHOUT A TESTING REGIME THE STATE WILL CONTINUE. TO OPERATE IN DARKNESS- ASSUMING THAT STATE SCHOOLS AND STATE AGENCIES ARE FILLING CALIFORNIA'S- RIGHT TO CLEAN AND SAFE WATER. SB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR WILL REMEDY THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND- OWN BUILDINGS TO COMPLETE A WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF THEIR FACILITIES. INCLUDING TEST FOR LEAD RATE ON THESE YOU KNOW- AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS IF THEY FIND A CONTAMINATED CONTAMINANT THE AGENCY OR SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPLACE THE PICTURE. AT THE EARLIEST PRACTICAL TIME SUBJECT TO FUNDING- IF MONEY IS NOT AVAILABLE AND REPLACEMENT IS NOT AVAILABLE THE OPERATING AGENCY WILL BE EXPECTED TO PREPARE WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT INCLUDES INTERIM REMEDIATION MEASURES AS WELL AS. REGULAR TESTING. I MADE REASON FROM THE NATION'S SCHOOL AND STATE AGENCY IS NEEDS OF THESE BUILDINGS OLD PLUMBING SO. ARE OFTEN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO POTENTIAL POLLUTION ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONTAIN LEAD AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS. ADDITIONALLY THESE OLD SYSTEMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE INEFFICIENT EITHER BY LEAKING AND WASTING POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF WATER. OR BY SIMPLY UTILIZING EXCESSIVE WATER FOR THEIR FUNCTIONS COMPARED TO MODERN FIXTURES AND APPLIANCES- SO- AS A RESULT SB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR WILL ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE SCHOOLS AND STATE AGENCIES. TO TEST THEIR WATER EFFICIENCY- AND SUBJECT TO FUNDING I REPLACE FIXTURES- APPLIANCES THAT DON'T MEET STATE WATER EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND FINALLY THE BILL REQUIRE SCHOOLS AND STATE AGENCIES. TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF INSTALLING ONSITE GREYWATER SYSTEMS I GOT NOT REQUIRE IT BUT REQUIRE AT LEAST A FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS- WE ARE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS. WITH THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING- CASH AND WE HOPE TO ADDRESS- SOME OF THE CONCERNS LAID OUT IN THEIR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE- AND I'M COMMITTED TO THAT DIALOGUE OVER THE COMING WEEKS WE KNOW THERE COST ISSUES HERE- WE TRY TO BE FLEXIBLE IN THE BILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. OUT WITH THEM- IT BY I THINK BOTTOM LINE AND BIG PICTURE- IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A PUBLIC. WHETHER IS POTENTIAL CAP CONTAMINATION THE SYSTEMS THAT'S BAD FOR EVERYONE BUT PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE DEVELOPING WHERE WE KNOW THESE CONTAMINANTS CAN BE EVEN MORE HARMFUL- THEN FOR THE POPULATION AT LARGE- WE NEED TO KNOW- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. ON WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY- IT'S GOT WATCH ON BEHALF OF THE STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL OUR SPONSOR. AND THOMAS AND SLOW ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PLUMBING AND MECHANICAL OFFICIALS. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER. A MISTER WHICH PLEASE RECEIVE YOUR READY OF TWO MINUTES. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M SCOTT WHICH I'M ACTUALLY HERE ON BEHALF OF BOTH THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL AND THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF OUR PLUMBING AND MECHANICAL OFFICIALS. IAPMO IS. THE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS ALL THE PLUMBING INSPECTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S ALSO THE ENTITY THAT PUBLISHES THE UNIFORM PLUMBING CODE SO IT'S THE BODY THAT SETS. UP OUR WATER PLUMBING STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PURPOSE FOR BEHIND ELEVEN FORTY FOUR IS THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN EXTREMELY SEVERE LEAD. ISSUE IN OUR PIPES IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND SPECIFICALLY IN SCHOOLS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN AN ALARMING INCREASE IN THE- NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BACTERIUM RELATED DISEASES THAT ARE RELATED TO PLUMBING SYSTEMS. MOST SPECIFICALLY AS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR LEGIONELLA DISEASE. BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HIGHLY UNDER REPORTED BUT NATIONALLY WE HAVE IN THE LAST REPORTABLE YEAR OVER TEN THOUSAND CASES OF LEGIONELLA. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T AWARE ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN PEOPLE WHO GET LEGIONELLA. PERISH FROM IT. IS EXTREMELY SERIOUS DISEASES SAID OUTBREAK TWO WEEKS AGO IN A IN A HOTEL IN HAWAII. WE THINK THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE BILL I JUST LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE OPPOSITION WE CERTAINLY SHARE THE SENATOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. WE WILL NEVER WAY DRAFTING THIS BILL TO NOT REQUIRE REMEDIATION IF THERE WASN'T FUNDING AVAILABLE TO OUR SENSITIVE THAT ISSUE. BUT TO REQUIRE THAT AT A MINIMUM. TEACHERS AND PARENTS BE NOTIFIED IF THERE'S A SERIOUS WATER ISSUE WITH A SCHOOL. AND THEY PUT A PLAN TOGETHER ON HOW TO MEDIATE ET- YOU KNOW AND LEAD CONTENT OR OTHER DANGEROUS BACTERIA. CASH IS WHAT OF OPPOSITION BASICALLY STATES THAT THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL BECAUSE THERE'S NO FUNDING WELL WE ADDRESS THE FUNDING ISSUE ON THE REPLACEMENT BUT TO ACCEPT YOUR ARGUMENTS ON MERELY PUTTING TOGETHER A MANAGEMENT PLAN IS BASICALLY A DON'T ASK DON'T TELL POLICY. WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY DANGEROUS BACTERIUM IN THE PIPES WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S LEAD AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TELL OUR PARENTS AND TEACHERS- BECAUSE THERE'S NO FUNDING. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND WE WOULD URGEAN AYE VOTE BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR IS MR IN SLOW HERE.

IN HERE WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN KILL OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS- SO I ANOTHER PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA M. I APPRECIATE THE- THE INTENT OF THE BILL BUT I AM CONCERNED- ON THE LIABILITY THAT HAPPENS- AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU COULD EXPAND ON THIS BUT- I KNOW THAT IN REAL ESTATE- WE DO CONTRACTS AND WE DO- AT ANY INVESTIGATION OR STUDY ON. A HOME- WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DISCLOSING THAT TO THE POTENTIAL BUYER. AND THEN IT'S A GO SHE DIDN'T ON YOU KNOW WHO PAYS FOR THE WORK AND SO FORTH BUT IT IT IT BECOMES OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP TAKING CARE OF. WHEN IT COMES TO THESE FACILITIES- ANYTHING THAT STATE- ALLOCATED ONE I WAS KIND OF CURIOUS YOUR PREVIOUS BILL NOTE THAT YOU JUST PRESENTED YOU DID I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO. ALLOCATE SOME FUNDING OR AT LEAST REQUEST FUNDING TO HAVE THE WORK DONE. SITTING I BUDGET SUB ONE I. WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN NOT- ALLOCATING FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE IN SEVERE DETERIORATION FOR- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND NOT HAVING THE FUNDING I MEAN THE WORKLOAD HAS BEEN EXPONENTIAL SO I'M KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO ONE AB WHY DIDN'T YOU ALLIGATOR OR SORT OF CREATE A FUNDING SOURCE OR A- JUST AS A MEANS BY WHICH THIS CAN BE DONE BESIDES THE FUNDING DOING INVESTIGATION DURING THE STUDIES KNOWING THAT IT'S THAT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AN ISSUE PUTTING THE NOTICES ON THERE. I'M I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM AN ATTORNEY'S PERSPECTIVE THE LIABILITY THAT COMES ACROSS THE STATE AND IS THIS OPEN A LITIGATION NIGHTMARE FOR MANY OF THESE- FOR THE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. THAT IT NOW ARE DISCLOSING THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE ALLOCATED FUNDING FROM THE STATE SO THE LEAGUE LITIGATION I DON'T WANT THIS AND I WOULD HATE FOR THE STATE TO SPEND MONEY ON LITIGATION. VERSUS ALLOCATING THE MONEY UP FRONT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE. SO IN TERMS OF LITIGATION IF I WERE INTENDANT I WOULD BE MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT LITIGATION IF A CHILD DRINKS CONTAMINATED WATER AND GETS SICK OR DIES. RIGHT AT RIVER MULTIPLE CHILDREN GOD FORBID THAT THAT TO ME IS A LITIGATION NIGHTMARE IT IS MUCH BETTER FRANKLY FOR EVERYONE FOR HELP WILL HELP THE COMMUNITY. AND FOR AVOIDING LITIGATION TAX YOU KNOW AND SO IF THERE IS CONTAMINATION SAY AND A DRINKING WATER SYSTEM MAYBE THEY SHUT IT OFF UNTIL THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT AND BRING IN- AN EXTERNAL SOURCE OF WATER- I DON'T. I CAN'T ENVISION ANY ARGUMENT TO SAY THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO KNOW IF THEIR WATER SYSTEMS ARE CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD WITH RADEON WITH WHICH AN ALOT- AND. AND THEN THEY CAN TAKE ACTION. I AGREE WITH YOU THOUSAND. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN OUR AGING. SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL FACILITIES FOR- PLUMBING SYSTEM FOR BETTER VENTILATION FOR FUNCTIONING. TOILETS AND ALL THE OTHER PROBLEMS AND I WITHOUT GETTING SIDETRACKED I WOULD SAY THIS IS WHY. I HAVE MAJOR ISSUES WITH. TAKING SO MUCH OF OUR SURPLUS AND READY AND SENDING CHECKS TO PEOPLE. AS OPPOSED TO USING THIS SURPLUS TO FOR EXAMPLE FIX OUR SCHOOLS AND A LOT OF POLITICAL PRESSURE WERE REGARDING. YOU KNOW. SOME MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DEMAND THAT WE SEND MORE MORE MONEY BACK TO TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT LOW INCOME. AS OPPOSED TO USING THAT TO FIX OUR TOILETS AND WATER SYSTEMS INPUT FILTER VENTILATION SYSTEMS AS WELL I JUST HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT. THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE SO I AM ALL FOR MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN OUR SCHOOLS- HOPE THAT WE GET THERE. BUT TO BE CLEAR THIS. LEGISLATION IS A STEP TO SAY LET'S AT LEAST KNOW IF WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AS AND MAKE SURE THAT IF A SCHOOL DOES HAVE A CONTAMINATION PROBLEM. THAT THE KIDS ARE NOT GETTING SICK AND THAT TEACHERS AND PARENTS AND KIDS NOW YOU CAN MAKE ALTERNATE ARRANGEMENTS IF THEY HAVE TO BRING IN BOTTLED WATER. THEY CAN DO THAT- BUT NOT KNOWING. IS UNACCEPTABLE IN MY VIEW. AND I AM COMPLETELY WITH YOU WHICH IS WHY I APPRECIATE AND REALLY RESPECT THE MERITS OF THE BILL I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THIS THERE WERE ALSO PROTECTING FOR MY ABILITY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN. IN IN IN PLACE- UNTIL THEY- IT FOR TO BE ABLE TO CARE OF THE- PROBLEM BECAUSE I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK WE SHOULD BE SPENDING OUR OUR RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE HAD A PROBLEM AND THEREFORE. YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD I REMEMBER SEVERAL YEARS AGO I ATTENDED A WATER SUMMIT IN THE STATE OF. CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE SO MUCH A WATER PROBLEM BUT MORE OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE A PROBLEM THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THE PROJECT YOU PLACE AND WE HAVE A VERY VERY OLD SYSTEM. IN PLACE THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED SO I'M COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. AND IF THIS MOVES FORWARD- THAT. MAYBE YOU HAVE A COMMITMENT TO. INCLUDE A- A STIPULATION WHAT WE ACTUALLY PROTECT THE SCHOOL pFUNDING AVAILABLE- THAT THEY CAN ONE AS YOU SAID BRING OTHER WATER RESOURCES INTO PLACE THAT THEY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES. AND HAVE THE PROTECTION THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE LITIGATED WHAT WHAT I. A I THINK THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE LITIGATED IF THEY ACTUALLY. POISONED STUDENTS OVER THE WATER POISONS TO INSPECT BUT I WILL COMMIT IS THAT GOING FORWARD NOT INCOME COMING YEARS. WE NEED TO GET MORE FUNDING TO OUR SCHOOLS TO ACTUALLY UPDATE THEIR PLUMBING SYSTEM. THERE'S POPULOUS. SUPPORT FOR THAT- AND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M WHO I AM I THINK THERE'S GOING TO. BE UP THERE WELL I'M CONFIDENT THERE WILL BE WORK TO DO THAT. SO IN OTHER WORDS. IF THIS BILL WERE SUPPOSED PASSES THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND WE IMPLEMENTED IN THE STUDIES DO YOU GO THROUGH- ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BE LIABLE TO LOCATION OR SOMEONE IS GET SICK WHICH AS A MOM I'M I'M ALL ABOUT PROTECTING YOUR KIDS. THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT YOU COULD PROTECT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM LITIGATION UNTIL THEY HAVE THE FUNDING PROVIDED I DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL INCREASES THEIR- ASIAN EXPOSURE. THIS BILL IF ANYTHING REDUCES- BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW OKAY WE HAVE ONE LETTER READ ON IN OUR WATER. AND SO WE DON'T WANT OUR KIDS TO DRINK THAT ANYMORE WE'RE GOING TO BRING AN EXTERNAL SOURCE OF WATER. INSTEAD OF THE DRINKING FOUNTAINS UNTIL WE CAN FIND A WAY TO REMEDIATE IT. THAT REDUCES THEIR LIABILITY I THINK JUST. FOR THIS FOR THEM NOT TO KNOW THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A KID GET SECOND LIKE- HOW DID THIS COULD. YOU NOW- AND THEN IN LEADING BEEN AS A LAWSUIT FILED A TO. DISCOVERY THEY FIND OUT THAT THERE THAT THE WATER SYSTEMS CONTAMINATED THAT SEEMS LIKE A BIGGER HEADACHE LITIGATION WISE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT. THAN DOING THE STUDY AND BEING ABLE TO SHUT THINGS DOWN IF THERE'S A PROBLEM. THAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. UNDERPANTS THANK THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE AND I APOLOGIZE I. THINK I STEPPED OUT DURING THE OPPOSITION'S TESTIMONY BUT- I JUST TO CLARIFY AND- BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT THE- COLLISION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING- THE CASSIA. IT WAS HIS EXPRESSED OPPOSITION IS THERE IS THERE SOME CONCERN THAT THE STANDARDS THAT YOU'RE REQUIRING FOR TESTING THE WATER IN THIS BILL ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE STANDARD SCHOOLS ALREADY USED TO. TEST THEIR WATER. WHITE I THINK THAT THE SENDS IN THE BILL ARE ARE PRETTY- ACCEPTED STANDARD BUT- WE DID HAVE- I DIDN'T MENTION WHETHER WE'RE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO WORK WITH K. K. RESPONSES OF IT ABOUT SO WE WERE. OR STARTING A CONVERSATION WITH THEM AND WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY TO- TO TRY TO HAVE A RESOLUTION OKAY ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE IT I MEAN. THE AND I KNOW YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR AB C. BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE SURE- ELEANOR FOR KIDS TO LEARN THEY NEED TO. BE SAFE AND THAT INCLUDES HAVING STATE WATER AND SAFE FAIR AND SCHOOLS RIGHT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME IN SCHOOLS. AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- I ALSO YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO SAID ON C. L. CATION BOARD- NOTES ON THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN TERMS OF FUNNY BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S- THEN WE NEED TO VERIFY THE PROBLEMS AND THEN IF I WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TO FIX THEM AND STEP UP AND- TAKE CARE OF THAT. YEAH WHAT IDEAS INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CAR WE CAN DO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER OKAY WELL- ALL RIGHT WELL THAT. PLEASE ARTICLE GOING BACK TO. YEAH WELL I. AND DISAGREE WITH YOU WELL I- BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT TALKING ABOUT NOW- SO WITH THAT BUILD PROTOTYPE THANK YOU SENATOR PAN- THE CENTER WE ARE ONE OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I'VE DONE A NUMBER OF BILLS MYSELF ON NOT LEAD. PIPES IN OUR SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE OUR CHILDREN HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE THAT IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WERE STILL WORRYING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS. STONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING IT FORWARD- WE HAVE A MOTION BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE HER QUESTION I WROTE THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN AM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL FOR ALL. FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE S. B. ELEVEN FORTY FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE. REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LEYVA HI LEYVA AYE OCHO BOAT HI. SOCIAL BURBANK FOR TENNESSEE. VALLEY GLAZER. RAZOR I'D MCGUIRE PAN HI CAN I THANK YOU MA'AM CONSULTANT ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT AUTHORS LET SENATOR MELINDA. ITEM NUMBER FOUR S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AND GOOD MORNING TODAY I'M HERE TO REPRESENT ALL PARENTS IN PRESENTING TO U. S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE. SB TEN FORTY FIVE ADDS LESSON PLANS AS DEFINED TO THE TEAM TO THE LIST OF TEACHING MATERIALS REQUIRED TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO PARENTS UPON REQUEST. EXISTING LAW DECLARES THAT ENHANCING THE ABILITY OF PARENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS IS A COMPELLING PUBLIC INTEREST AND MAINTAINS THAT PARENTS HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO ACCESS RECORDS RELATED TO THEIR CHILDREN. NUMEROUS STUDIES A RESEARCH INDICATES THAT STUDENT OUTCOMES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WHEN PARENTS ARE INVOLVED IN STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL RECEIVE HIGHER GRADES AND ATTEND COLLEGE IF THEIR PARENTS ARE ACTIVE IN THEIR EDUCATION. SB TEN FORTY AIMED AT PROVIDING THAT TRANSPARENCY MAKING CURRENCY MUTUAL PARTNER IN EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN. THE BILL GOES NO FURTHER THAN ADDING LESSON PLANS TO THE LIST OF MATERIALS ALREADY REQUIRED TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO PARENTS. IT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR TEACHERS TO HAVE A LESSON PLAN POSTED WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THE START OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR AND OF COURSE IT ALLOWS TEACHERS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THEIR LESSON PLANS AS NECESSARY. NOTHING POSTED TO THE WEBSITE IS SET IN STONE AND CAN BE EASILY ADJUSTED AT THE TEACHER'S DISCRETION. FINALLY THIS MEASURE MAKES IT EASIER FOR PARENTS TO SEE WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT. AND WHY IS CURRICULUM TRANSPARENCY IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY. THE OPPONENTS WILL SAY IT IS AN ADDED BURDEN ALREADY BURDENED TEACHERS BUT I SAY IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO A CHILD'S EDUCATION THAT PARENTS BE INCLUDED. CLASSROOMS ARE WHERE MANY THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS TAKE PLACE AND TEACHERS ARE THERE TO TEACH HER STUDENTS HOW TO THINK BUT NOT WHAT TO THINK. THE GOAL IS TO SHOW BOTH SIDES OF AN ISSUE AND HELP STUDENTS FORM THEIR OWN OPINIONS THIS IS HOW WE CREATE INSIGHTFUL YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE ABLE TO DISCERN BETWEEN SENSATIONALIZED NEWS AND THE TRUTH. BUT AS WE KNOW PARENTS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONTENT THAT IS BEING TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM AND PARENTS DO HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THEIR CHILDREN ARE HEARING IN LEARNING. IN THE PLACE WHERE THE BULK OF THEIR WAKING HOURS WHICH IS AT SCHOOL. OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN PARENTS AND EDUCATORS AND THE STUDENTS. AND PROVIDING A FULLY TRANSPARENT CURRICULUM MEANS TEACHERS ARE INOCULATED FROM THE ANGER PARENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE SURPRISED. BY THE MATERIAL TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM. MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALREADY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR POSTING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND MANY SCHOOLS ALREADY REQUIRE THEIR TEACHERS TO SUBMIT THEIR WEEKLY LESSON PLANS. MAKING THESE LESSON PLANS AVAILABLE TO PARENTS ON THE INTERNET IS NOT DIFFICULT AND IN FACT IS ALREADY BEING DONE IN MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS. IF YOU GO TO A SCHOOLS DASHBOARD YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION ON TESTING SCORES ON DEMOGRAPHICS AND EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES BUT WHERE CAN YOU FIND THE INFORMATION ON WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEING TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM. HIDING INFORMATION ON THE CURRICULUM ENABLES PARENTS TO REINFORCE CLASSROOM LEARNING. IF YOU KNOW WHAT TOPICS YOUR CHILD IS LEARNING ABOUT ISN'T IT A LOT EASIER TO INITIATE CONVERSATIONS AT THE DINNER TABLE OR IN THE RIGHT HOME FROM SCHOOL ON THESE TOPICS. OR SUPPLEMENT TO CLASSROOM LEARNING BY READING BOOKS WITH YOUR CHILD THAT BUILD ON THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOPIC THAT THE GOVERNING CLASS. THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WILL CLAIM THAT THE CURRICULUM OFTEN CHANGES AND IT NEEDS TO CHANGE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VARYING NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS. AND THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT TEACHRS WOULD HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH. AND HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THE SCHOOLS THEY FINDER TEACHING TO THEIR STUDENTS. AND WHERE'S PARENTS ARE CURRENTLY PARENTS MUST VISIT THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICE TO SEE THE CURRICULUM BUT ONLY DURING BUSINESS HOURS. THIS MEASURE ALLOWS THE INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO BE PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY. WHEN SIGNING A CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY BILL IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM WAS QUOTED AS SAYING. IN ESSENCE TO ME THIS MADE COMMONSENSE IT'S A TRANSPARENCY BILL AND WE'RE FOR TRANSPARENCY AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE CLAIM THEIR FOR TRANSPARENCY FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT NOT FOR THEMSELVES. ALLOWING A LITTLE TRANSPARENCY FOR PARENTS TO SEE WHAT THEIR CHILD LEARNED IS LEARNING IS A GOOD THING IN MY OPINION. WITH ME HERE VIA TELECONFERENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL FOR LARRY SAND A FORMER TEACHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS EMPOWERMENT NETWORK. AND DOCTOR WHO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIANS FOR EQUAL RIGHTS FOUNDATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S ALL RIGHT WE WILL GO TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF MR SAM WE WILL START WITH YOU AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. I THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING BALONEY. THE FDA INSISTS THAT EVERY LAST INGREDIENT OF THE HEAVY HEAVILY PROCESSED FOODS LISTED ON THE PACKAGE LABEL. NO ONE HAS AN ISSUE WITH THIS BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT WE PUT IN OUR BODIES AND YOU MIGHT THINK THE SAME MENTALITY WOULD BE IN PLACE WHAT GOES INTO OUR MINDS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF CHILDREN BUT UNFORTUNATE HAS BECOME A VERY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. WITH THE REVELATION THAT TOO MANY PUBLIC SCHOOLS BEEN TEACHING THINGS THAT A CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY THE LEAST THERE IS NO PUSHBACK FROM PARENTS IN FACT LAWMAKERS NINETEEN STATES HAVE INTRODUCED BILLS THAT REQUIRE. CURRICULA TRANSPARENCY LET'S MAKE CALIFORNIA NUMBER TWENTY. SO WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE AGAINST THIS. A TEACHER UNION OFFICIALLY- UNION OFFICIAL EXCUSE ME RECENTLY MOCKED PARENTS CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY SUGGESTING THAT THEY BOUGHT OUT OF SCHOOL AFFAIRS. A MAGAZINE WRITER RECENTLY REFERRED TO PARENTS AS HOUSEHOLD TYRANTS INSIST THAT THE CALL FOR TRANSPARENT TRANSPARENCY IS A WACKO CHRISTIAN PLOT. THE BILL MISSOURI WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO POST ALL TEACHER TRAINING MATERIALS ONLINE BUT THE BILL DREW CRITICISM FROM THE STATE REPRESENTATIVE WHO CALLED PROPOSAL AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND THE LAST ONE A SPOKESPERSON FOR PEN AMERICA A GROUP WHOSE MISSION IS TO QUOTE PROTECT FREE EXPRESSION SAYS THAT SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY IS ESSENTIALLY A BIG BROTHER TYPE REGIME THAT SOUNDS GOOD ON PAPER. BUT IT'S VERY EASY TO SEE HOW CAN BE ABUSED TO INTIMIDATE AND PUNISH INSTRUCTORS. BIG BROTHER HOUSEHOLD TYRANTS UNDERMINE PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION HARDLY PARENTS WHO SENATE-ROOM THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE TRYING TO UNDERMINE THEM IN REALITY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE LEARNING OR NOT LEARNING. LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING I AM HARDLY ANTI TEACHER IN FACT THAT TAUGHT THE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS IN NEW YORK IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THAT MOST TEACHERS ARE HARD WORKING AND DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND AS A SAFEGUARD FOR PARENTS WE DEFINITELY NEED S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE IS NOT INTRUSIVE. YEAH WELL LET PARENTS KNOW JUST WHAT THEIR PRECIOUS CHILDREN ARE LEARNING IN SCHOOL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ARE WILL GO TO YOUR NEXT WITNESS DR WU IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB TEN FORTY FIVE WHICH REQUIRES TEACHERS TO PROVIDE A COPY OF THEIR LESSONS PLANS WITHIN THREE DAYS UPON THE REQUEST OF APPARENT. LESSON PLANS ARE TOLD THE GUY TO GUY CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION CTA BELIEVES THAT HE MANDARIN PACE IN WHICH OF COURSE OF STUDY IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE CLASS YOU MUST BE DETERMINED BY THE INDIVIDUAL. EDUCATORS DO THEIR BEST PLAN THE COURSES BUT LESSONS QUICKLY CHANGED BECAUSE OF UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES. WHETHER BE AN IMMEDIATE HIT IT WHEN AN EXAM SHOWS A CLASSES NEED FOR ADDITIONAL- REVIEWING MATERIAL- LARGER PIVOT TO OF VIRTUAL. VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. CITY BELIEVE THAT PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION TRANSPARENCY IS CRITICAL. AND THERE ARE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT FROM THE STATE LEVEL TO THE ONLY A LEVEL. THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FAIR FRAMEWORK STANDARDS CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. THE CAP PROCESS IN THE LOCAL PTA. ONE THE CURRICULUM. MATERIALS ARE APPROVED IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE TEACHERS TO IMPLEMENT THEM AND TEACHERS NEED THE FLEXIBILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DELIVER THAT MATERIAL. CITY BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT HELPFUL NOR APPROPRIATE TO REQUIRE EDUCATORS TO SUPPLY THE LESSON PLANS. TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS UPON REQUEST. HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT INAPPROPRIATE FOR TEACHERS AND PARENTS DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP. BASED ON TRUST TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF STUDENTS. MANDATING LESSON PLANS TO BE TURNED OVER THE SELF AND THE ABILITY TO BUILD THAT RELATIONSHIP FOR THESE REASONS. FIFTIETH RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE TEN FORTY FIVE AM ASX RENOVA.

IN THAT PROCESS AS THIS THE ASSIST GIVE THEM ANY IT'S JUST BURDENS IN OUR MIND THE OVERBURDENED TEACHERS WHO WANT TO SERVE OUR TEACHERS THE BEST LIKE THOSE THAT WE HEARD FROM FOLKS AROUND STATE- JUST REQUIRING A DAILY LESSON PLAN EVERY DAY IS THAT ONE. IS ONE MORE BURDEN AND A VERY LARGE BURDEN ON THOSE ALREADY OVERWORKED AND UNDERPAID IN MANY CASES IT PROVIDES NOR TRANSPARENCY BUT FEELS LIKE AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A VERY BETWEEN TEACHERS AND PARENTS AND STUDENTS THIS LAW FEELS VERY TROUBLING TO OUR STAFF AND OUR MEMBERS BECAUSE IT IS UNNECESSARY. AND IN FACT CLOSE. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS AN A. J. TO FEEL FOR. MOTIVATE I WANT TO BURN OUT TEACHERS MORE. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT NECESSARILY SUPPORTERS ARE DOING THAT HERE BUT IT CAN REALLY FEEL THIS THIS ENERGY THAT WE WANT TO.

YEAH MEDICARE WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR OKAY LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS SENATOR DOLLY. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK THE OFFER FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT TO MOVE THE BILL. I KNOW THAT- I BROUGHT A BILL SIMILAR TO THIS NOT QUITE. LIKE THIS BUT- I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR TRANSPARENCY FOR PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO. ENGAGE IN SPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE SEEN DISTANCE LEARNING IN THE BUILDING NOT TO BE ABLE TO. ACCESS OUR SCHOOLS AS FREELY AS WE LIKE JUST BECAUSE OF THE CODE CONCERNS WE HAD THE PAST SO- LIKE MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER THE ONLY ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT I WOULD JUST- THE CITY OF SANTA MELINDA'S THAT EXISTING LAW DOES ALREADY ALLOW PARENTS TO INSPECT. HIGHER CURRICULUM SO I THINK THAT THEY MET PARENTS DO HAVE THAT RIGHT I KNOW WHEN MY GIRLS WERE IN. GRADE SCHOOL AND ANYTIME I EVER WANTED TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE LEARNING IT WAS NEVER A PROBLEM. I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD BUT I WILL BE VOTING NO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOU KNOW I JUST. FIRST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CALLED IN OR- OR CAME TO SUPPORT THE BILL I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH I THINK- YOU KNOW WE SAW THE EVIDENCE DAY BY SO MANY PEOPLE CALLING IN TO SUPPORT THAT THERE IS A STRONG DESIRE FOR THIS TRANSPARENCY. AND YOU KNOW- I HAVE KIDS IN SCHOOL STILL AS MANY MEMBERS OF. THE DEER AND WITH. MANY TEACHERS IS EASIER TO COMMUNICATE IN ASKING AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLASSROOM BUT IT'S ALWAYS EASY. FOR EVERYONE- THE- THERE IS A- WASHINGTON. ABC POLL THAT SAID 81% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE A SAY IN WHAT. THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL TEACHERS. THIS COINCIDES WITH THE STATEMENT MADE. BY PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECRETARY EDUCATE- EDUCATION SECRETARY ARNE DUNCAN IN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND HE SAID AND I QUOTE. I WANT TO HAVE TOO MANY PARENTS DEMANDING EXCELLENCE IN THEIR SCHOOLS. I WANT ALL PARENTS TO BE REAL PARTNERS IN EDUCATION WITH THEIR CHILDREN'S TEACHERS. FROM CRADLE TO CAREER WHEN PARENTS DEMAND CHANGE AND BETTER OPTIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THEY BECOME THERE THE REAL ACCOUNTABILITY BACKSTOPS FOR THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AND HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT AND CLEARLY AN INTEREST TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IN OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION SHOULD NOT. BE A PARTISAN ISSUE BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS- THAT THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP. THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS NOTED IN THEIR OPPOSITION LETTER THAT SB TEN FORTY FIVE MAY ADDITIONALLY INHIBIT THE ABILITY OF AN EDUCATOR TO PROVIDE STUDENTS THE MOST EFFICIENT USE. OF LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AREN'T QUITE TO THE CONTRARY MEMBERS THE PANDEMIC ACTUALLY PROVIDED PARENTS A WINDOW INTO THE CLASSROOM PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO THEY CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT WAS BEING TAUGHT AND WHAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE LEARNING. THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL WOOD MISTER ADMINISTRATORS NOTED IN THEIR OPPOSITION. THAT PROVIDING LESSON PLANS TO PERRANCE SOMEHOW REDUCES THE POWER OF TEACHING BY RESTRICTING EDUCATORS TO TEACH THE BOOK AND FURTHER LEAD TO JOB DISSATISFACTION IN INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF THE EDUCATOR SHORTAGE- I FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE BECAUSE EDUCATORS ARE ALREADY. REQUIRED IN MANY INSTANCES TO CREATE A LESSON PLAN IT IS NOT A FURTHER BURDEN FOR PROVIDING THAT TO PARENTS. OF TEACHERS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO FOLLOW STATEWIDE CURRICULUM FORMER UP FRAMEWORK FOLLOWING THE ASSIGNED TEXTBOOKS SO IF THEY'RE NOT. THEN WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN THOSE WHAT IS BEING ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL. I'M AND ALSO MANY SHARE WITH YOU BECAUSE- I AM KIND OF IN THIS MYSELF RIGHT NOW PERSONALLY WITH MY KIDS IN SCHOOL. A LOT OF SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE IT NOW- AT MY CHILDREN'S SCHOOL IT'S CANVASSED IN ART YEAH CAMPUS AN INFINITE CAMPUS. AND I CAN GO ON THERE AND I CAN SEE. WHAT GRADES MY KIDS GOT IF THEY WERE TARDY IF THEY WERE ABSENT- YOU KNOW ALL THAT STUFF THEY HATE IT I LOVE IT AS A PARENT. BUT YOU KNOW IT I CAN'T QUITE GET IN THERE IT DEPENDS ON THE TRAINING OF THE TEACHER BUT I CAN'T QUITE GET IN THERE TO SEE THE ACTUAL ASSIGNMENTS THOUGH I WAS FOR INSTANCE THE OTHER DAY I COULD PULL UP A QUOTE IS THAT THEY WERE GIVEN. I'M IN CLASS WHICH IS TEACHING THEM ABOUT A LITERACY PASSED THAT USED TO BE GIVEN I'M IN ORDER FOR- YOU KNOW PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AND THAT WAS. A GOOD FIND FOR ME BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING WE COULD FURTHER TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW AT HOME- CAN'T FIND THAT EVER BUT NOT EVERY SCHOOL HAS THIS AND THIS IS WHAT PARENTS WANT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT. THESE THNGS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN OUR CLASSROOMS AND- AND WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT SO I JUST. WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT THAT- SOME SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS ACT FACT MANY SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS- AND CERTAINLY PARENTS WOULD APPRECIATED IF. IF ALL OF THE SCHOOLS REDOING THIS- SB TEN FORTY FIVE DOES MAKE IT EASIER FOR PARENTS TO BE A PARTNER WITH TEACHERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENSURE CHILDREN RECEIVE A QUALITY EDUCATION- THE FINAL POINT WAS FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND THEY SAID THAT LESSON PLANS- TOOL TO GUIDE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION. AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT IS EXACTLY TRUE SAID GIVING PARENTS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THAT GUIDE IS HELPFUL TO THE STUDENTS HELPFUL TO THE TEACHERS AND IT'S HELPFUL- YOU KNOW TO EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS EDUCATIONAL PROCESS WE ARE NOT. I UNDERSTAND TEACHERS ARE I FEEL OVERBURDENED I GET IT BUT- WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THE MOON AND THE STARS HERE WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR THE LESSON PLAN IF SOMETHING CHANGES IN THE LESSON PLAN. THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND IT'S TYPICALLY A TEACHERS NOT GOING TO DO A LESSON PLAN DAY BY DAY IF THERE. AT ALL TO BE HONEST- THEY'RE DOING A LESSON PLAN LIKELY BY THE WEEK SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE OUT A LESSON PLAN EVERY TIME THEY MAKE A CHANGE FOR EVERY. PARENT THAT ASKS FOR IT I MEAN ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE FOR TO BE PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY SO FOR INSTANCE IF THE SCHOOL HAS. THE APP LIKE MY CHILDREN'S SCHOOL DOES THEY JUST POSTED ON THE APP IT'S EASY PEASY AND ANY PARENT CAN ACCESS IT IF THEY CHOOSE TO- SO IT'S JUST IT'S NOT AN OVER. A BURDEN SAM REQUEST AND I THINK- PERHAPS. THOSE WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION- OVERSTATING THE CONCERNS- WITH THE BILL. IN IT. FINALLY I. YOU KNOW I'M I'M READING. THE NEWS ABOUT- THIS. WAVE OF PARENTAL CONCERN THAT IS SWEEPING THE NATION NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE WERE SOME TEACHERS UNION REPRESENTATIVES WHO. WHO MADE SOME VERY INFLAMMATORY COMMENTS ABOUT THE DESIRE OF PARENTS TO BECOME INVOLVED. IN THEIR STUDENTS EDUCATION IMPACT ONE WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY. THAT THIS IS HOW WARS START. OKAY PARENTS AREN'T STARTING A WAR IF ANYTHING IT'S COMMENTS LIKE THAT IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THAT. DEBTORS DURING THE WAR WITH PARENTS AND WE WANT. TO TAMP THAT DOWN WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. THE PARTNERSHIP THIS IS. THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE A WEDGE BETWEEN PARENTS AND STUDENTS AND TEACHERS THIS IS MEANT TO BRING THEM EVEN CLOSER TOGETHER SO THAT PARENTS CAN HELP THEIR CHILDREN WE KNOW FULL WELL. THE LEARNING LOSS THAT TOOK PLACE BECAUSE OF CODE IN BECAUSE OF. YOUR KIDS AND MY KIDS HAVING TO SIT IN FRONT OF A LAPTOP COMPUTER ALL DAY LONG- NOT SEEING THEIR PEERS THEIR TEACHERS NOT EVEN SEEING THEM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE THEIR CAMERAS ON. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LEARNING LOSS AND PARENTS REALLY NOW WANT TO BE MORE INVOLVED NOT ONLY TO CLOSE THAT GAP BUT THEY GOT. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THEY THAT THEY ARE MORE INVOLVED SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ASKING- IN WITH THAT- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I FELT. THANK YOU CENTER MELENDEZ AND AYE I WOULD JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME YOU SIX- ATTENDED A SCHOOL BOARD MEETING. BUT I THINK IN PARENT INVOLVEMENT IS ESSENTIAL BUT SOMEONE NEEDS TO GIVE SOME OF THESE PARENTS A LESSON. ON HOW TO BE PROFESSIONAL YELLING AT PEOPLE SCREAMING AT PEOPLE RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE AISLES- HECKLING PEOPLE AND STUDENTS WHO ARE SPEAKING. I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THAT PEOPLE HAVE SO I AGREE WITH YOU A 100% THAT PARENTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE INVOLVED. BUT WE SHOULD BE MODELING GOOD BEHAVIOR FOR OUR STUDENTS I WOULD. HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR DOLLY MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
