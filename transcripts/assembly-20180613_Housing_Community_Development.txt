EVERYONE TO THE WEDNESDAY JUNE THIRTEENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT MEMBERS AT THIS TIME TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHIU HERE CHIU HERE MAIENSCHEIN. MENTIONED HERE CHAO. CHOI HERE CHILLY HERE GLORIA. GLORIA HERE WE MONTH. THE MONEY HERE WOULD. I DO HAVE A QUORUM ONE A WELCOME SENATOR ROTH UP TO. PRESENT FILE ITEM TO IT SP ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. CENTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT PERTAINS TO HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS IN ASSOCIATION RESIDENTS SENATE ESSENTIALLY HAS THREE PARTS FIRST ALLOWS RESIDENTS OF COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS THE ASSOCIATION'S. TOP TEN BY EMAIL TO RECEIVE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS SUCH AS ANNUAL BUDGETS AN ANNUAL POLICY STATEMENTS BY EMAIL. OPTING IN VIA EMAIL. SECOND IT CHANGES A NOTICE REQUIREMENT FOR PROPOSED RULE CHANGES FROM. TWENTY EIGHT DAYS FROM THIRTY DAYS IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE MORE EFFECTIVE CALENDAR RING OF MEETINGS. AND FINALLY THE BILL ALLOWS FOR. PERHAPS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PIECE ALLOWS FOR ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION IN THE EVENT THAT A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES SEEKING ELECTION IS EQUAL TO. OR FEWER THAN A NUMBER OF BOARD SEATS AVAILABLE. WE'VE ADDED A PROVISION THIS ACCLAMATION SECTION THAT INSURERS PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTICIPATION ELECTION BY REQUIRING THE ELECTION RULES AND NOMINATION PROCEDURES. WE PERSONALLY PROVIDED TO RESIDENTS THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THE NOMINATION DEADLINE SO IN ESSENCE IF AT THE END OF A VERY FULL ON ROBUST NOMINATION PROCESS YOU HAVE THREE CANDIDATES FOR THREE SEATS. GIVEN THESE PROCEDURES IF THEY'RE FOLLOWED THE ELECTION CAN PROCEED BY ACCLAMATION AS OPPOSED TO THE NORMAL. OF DETAIL PROCESS I KNOW THERE'S SOME. AMENDMENTS THAT ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE THAT ARE BEING WORKED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO INCREASE EVEN FURTHER THE TRANSPARENCY. HERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR YOUR MEMBERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND. MOVING THOSE AMENDMENTS FORWARD AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT IN TIME. GREAT THANK YOU YOUR WITNESSES. HI KATHY VAN ALSTYNE THEM DAMN STRATEGY GROUP REPRESENTING LAGUNA WOODS VILLAGE. I WOULD TO SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND. LAGUNA WOODS VILLAGE AS A DEVELOPMENT THAT HOUSE. THREE THREE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN. WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES. THERE ARE TWELVE AND A HALF THOUSAND HOMES WITHIN THIS DEVELOPMENT I MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS. AND. THE WE'VE TALKED WITH THE THE THE SENATOR MENTIONED THOUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN A CLEAN UP IN THAT SOME THE FEASIBILITY ISSUES THAT WOULD REFLECT THAT WE TRY TO IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN. SAVE SOME OF THERE ARE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING IT BACK INTO THE SERVICES. MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION THAT OUR RESIDENTS DESERVE. MOST OF. OUR RESIDENTS ARE ON AND. MODEST FIXED COME. OTHER. SENIOR COMMUNITY FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER. A HAVE. A CHALLENGE. WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT BOARD MEETINGS EVERY YEAR OF FOR EACH OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS LAST YEAR WE HAD THREE. THREE CHORD ELECTIONS. AND NONE WERE COMPETITIVE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH. MEMBERS WHO NOMINATED THEMSELVES TO WORK TO RUN. AND. SO WE SPENT. BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE OUTCOME IS PREDETERMINED ALREADY. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT. AT A AT A MEANS TO. BE FRUGAL WITH OUR OUR RESIDENTS RESOURCES. AND. MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE BEEN UP WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO RUN WE'D LIKE PEOPLE TO RUN AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. BUT IN THE EVENT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CANDIDATES WE WOULD LIKE TO EXERCISE THE. SAME ABILITY THAT I MUNICIPALITIES HAVE SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE WHICH IS TO BE ABLE TO ELECT BY ACCLAMATION. IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH CANDIDATES. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE WERE HERE TODAY IN IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. HOW WANT TO THANK? STAFF FOR THE ANALYSIS WHICH POINTS OUT THAT THIS. NO IS IT IS NOT. ANYTHING ENTIRELY NEW. THIS IS DONE AND THERE IS IT'S DONE IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS NOTHING I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT. THE. ELECTION PROCESS IN THE DAVIS STIRLING ACT IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE. I'M AND ONE THING IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CERTAIN QUORUM OF BALLOTS THAT A RETURN BEFORE. THEY CAN ACTUALLY BE COUNTED. THERE ARE A NUMBER F SITUATIONS WHERE THAT QUORUM IS NOT REACHED SO IN THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE WE'RE HAVING HERE IS IT YOU MAY HAVE MEMBERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY WANTING TO BE. A BOARD MEMBERS AND RUNNING FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AND THROUGH THE EXISTING BALLOT PROCESS IF THAT QUORUM MINIMUM QUORUM OF RETURN BALLOTS IS NOT ACHIEVED THOSE MEMBERS CANNOT. BECOME BOARD MEMBERS SO THIS THIS ACTUALLY DOES IN SOME WAYS HELP US GET NEW BOARD MEMBERS ON TO ABORT ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE FEWER CANDIDATES THEN THERE ARE. VACANCIES OR EQUAL TO NUMBER ALLOWS FOR THAT TRANSITION OF LEADERSHIP TO HAPPEN WHEN WE DO FACE VOTER APATHY WHICH DOES HAPPEN QUITE A BIT. IN A CHOI ELECTION SO OF FOR THOSE REASONS AND THE REASON CENTER ROTH PRESENTED WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. JENNIFER WHAT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS IN SUPPORT. AND AT THIS TIME LET ME ASK IF THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD MORNING TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARJORIE MURRAY. CENTER FOR HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION LAW. WE REPRESENT HOMEOWNERS WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY TWO THOUSAND HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS. FIRST I WILL SAY WHY DOES ANYBODY CARE ABOUT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS. FOR THE SIMPLE REASON. THAT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT COUNTRY CLUBS. THERE NOT CASUAL NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ORGANIZE. I A JULY FOURTH PICNICS. THIS IS ANOTHER LEVEL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE QUITE CLEAR BY THE CALIFORNIA UP. HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION HAVE EXTRAORDINARY POWERS. OVER THE LIVES AND THE PROPERTY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE AND THAT POWER IS EXERCISED THROUGH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SO FOR THAT REASON WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATUTES GOVERNING HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS AND ANY ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THEM. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD THROUGH LEGISLATION THIS IS THE THIRD EFFORT. THE INDUSTRY IS DETERMINED TO ELIMINATE ELECTIONS AND TO REPLACE THEM WITH ELECTIONS BY NOT NOT EVEN ELECTIONS. TO SEE BOARD DIRECTORS BY ACCLAMATION. AND ONE OTHER DISTRESSING THINGS IS IT'S. HOMEOWNERS REPORT TO US THAT THIS IS ALREADY TAKING PLACE. BOARD DIRECTORS ARE ALREADY BEING SEATED BY ACCLAMATION. AND SO THESE REPEATED ATTEMPTS AB LEGISLATION ARE REALLY THE PETITION BY THE ASSOCIATION INDUSTRY. TO ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO BLESS A PLAQUE PRACTICE ALREADY IN PLACE. SO. THE UNFORTUNATE THING ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT COMBINES TWO POWERS. BOARDS ALREADY HAVE UNDER EXISTING LAW THE RIGHT TO SET QUALIFICATIONS FOR BOARD DIRECTORS. IT'S A POWER THEY ABUSE HOMEOWNERS REPORT TO US THAT THE QUALIFICATIONS ARE THINGS LIKE YOU HAVE TO SPEAK ENGLISH I'M NOT KIDDING. YOU CANNOT BE DISABLED YOU CANNOT BE DEAF BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO HIRE A SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER TO TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON AT A BOARD MEETING. YOU HAVE TO BE A FULL TIME RESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION EVEN IN THOSE ASSOCIATIONS COMPRISING SECOND HOMES. AND MOST DISTURBING YOU CANNOT EVER HAVE SUED THE ASSOCIATION IN THE PREVIOUS SIX YEARS OR TEN YEARS OR WHATEVER. IN OTHER WORDS YOU CANNOT BE A PERSON ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE HE ARE YOUR RIGHTS THROUGH THE COURTS. ALL OF THIS IS EXTREMELY DISTURBING TO US. SO ELECTIONS IN ASSOCIATIONS ARE CRITICAL BECAUSE THESE ARE SELF GOVERNING ORGANISATIONS. MEMBERSHIP IS MANDATORY WHEN YOU BUY AN ASSOCIATION HOME YOU HAVE TO BELONG TO THE ASSOCIATION. AND THE BOARD. EXERCISES ITS POWER UNDER AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IT ALSO CONTROLS ALL THE ASSOCIATION MONEY. SO WE HAVE A COMBINATION OF AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES. WE ONLY CHECK ON WHICH IS THE VOTE. AND THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO REPLACE LEADERSHIP. SO WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPELL WE URGE THE COMMITTEE. TO VOTE NO ON A. AND TO SEE THAT A DOES NOT PROCEED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AS THESE PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS. HAVE ATTEMPTED. FINALLY I WILL SAY THAT THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE RIGHT TO RUN FOR OFFICE HAS BEEN CONFERRED. BY. AT THE MOMENT AND THE EVENT THAT SOMEBODY BUYS AN ASSOCIATION HOME. SO IT'S CREATED THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IT'S BEEN ELABORATED ON BY THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE STATUTES. CREATED. THROUGH A BIPARTISAN EFFORT IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE TWO THOUSAND SIX. AND THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN REAFFIRMED THROUGH THE COURTS. SO WE URGE A NO VOTE ON THE MEASURE. S. WITNESS. YES MY NAME IS TOM SIR I'M A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CENTER PRINT A CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION LAW. I'M A RETIRED SUPERIOR COURT COMMISSIONER AND I DO LIVE IN A LARGE A SENIOR. COMMUNITY IN A COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT. IN SOLANO COUNTY. AND I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL POINT OUT THAT. THE PROVISION ON A SEATING BY ACCLAMATION IS REALLY A DUAL THREAT TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THIS WAY FIRST THERE'S. WHAT? MARJORIE IS POINTED OUT WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE ONGOING ABUSES OF THE EXISTING POWER TO SET QUALIFICATIONS. TO RUN FOR THE BOARD. THIS SECOND THREAT IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THIS IS DRAFTED. IT IS ONE INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS WHO LOOKING AT THE SITUATION CAN. UNILATERALLY DECLARE A THAT THERE IS THE RIGHT NUMBER OF CANDIDATES AND THEREFORE CANCEL THE ELECTION. THISMAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE REALLY ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FOR ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH THAT DECISION TO RAISE THE HEAT CHALLENGE. THERE'S NOTHING TO LITIGATE THERE'S NO ELECTION THE STATUTES ARE ALL WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT MEMBERS WHO DISAGREE WITH THE WAY OF ELECTION IS GONE. HAS THE RIGHT TO TO GO INTO COURT INCLUDING SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND REYES THESE CLAIMS BUT WITH NO ELECTION. THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO VEHICLE AND WE WITH WHICH TO CHALLENGE. SECONDLY. IN ISSUES BEEN MADE THAT AND REALLY THE PRIMARY. JUSTIFICATION ADVANCE FOR THE THIS SITUATION FOR THIS. A BILL. ISN'T THERE WILL BE A COST SAVING. USING THE PROPONENTS OWN STATISTICS WHERE THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE SPENT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A THREE ELECTIONS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ELECTION. BUT THEY ALSO HAVE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND. A RESIDENTS. THAT WORKS OUT TO A DOLLAR ELEVEN CENTS. PER. RESIDENT. AND THAT IS A TINY COSTA P. TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. JUST I JUST HAVE TO NOTE THAT TYPICALLY H. AWAY DUES ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TINY FRACTION OF ONE MONTHS CESSPIT. TO HAVE TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE. COST WELL WORTH PAYING. ON MARJORIE'S POINT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS ALREADY ON GOING I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN MY OWN ASSOCIATION. ARE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS WERE RECENTLY REVISED AT THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL IN AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF COUNSEL. THREE INSERTED A PROVISION FOR SEATING BY ACCLAMATION. SO AGAIN IT IS REALLY HAPPENING ALREADY WHY DO WE NEED THIS BILL AND I THINK MARJORIE'S OBSERVATION IS A GOOD ONE. AND FINALLY. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. IN COMPARING THIS SITUATION. TO PUBLIC ELECTIONS ARE EITHER SCHOOL BOARDS OR CITY COUNCILS. THEIR SAFEGUARDS THERE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL AND FOR SCHOOL BOARD. ARE SET BY STATUTE THEY'RE NOT SET BY THE SCHOOL BOARD ITSELF. OR THE CITY COUNCIL ITSELF AND SECONDLY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT IN THE SCHOOL BOARD SITUATION THERE'S A SAFEGUARD THERE WERE. PEOPLE CAN RAISE AN OBJECTION AND TRIED TO OVERTURN THE DECISION TO SEAT PEOPLE BY ACCLAMATION. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WOULD AGAIN ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. HELLO MY NAME IS THERESA LUCAS I'M FROM YOLO COUNTY AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GUS PETRA BORG I'M FROM PLASTER COUNTY. DROVE AN HOUR AND A HALF TO GET HERE THIS MORNING TO LODGE MY OPPOSITION AS WELL AND JUST A NOTE. I'M A FORMER ELECTED DIRECTOR OF AN ASSOCIATION. OPPOSING. I'M MARGIE SUING ANY ANTI I'M IN. I'M A PRESENT BOARD MEMBER OF A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. I'M OPPOSED TO THE ACCLAMATION PORTION. AND I'M IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. MY NAME IS JACQUELINE JACKSON I'M FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY I RAN FOR. ABOARD OFFICE UNDER VERY. TENSION A DETENTION WRITTEN. CIRCUMSTANCES AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND UP LET ME START WITH A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ARE. FIRST OF ALL PROPITIATE THE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING CONVERSATION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. I'LL JUST SAY FOR MYSELF FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE FOR A FEW YEARS AGO I MOVED INTO A BUILDING THAT. HOUSING H. AWAY AND WE HAVE HAD TROUBLE RECRUITING CANDIDATES. FOR THE BOARD. AND. AND I DO KNOW THAT THIS IS A SITUATION THAT IS IS VERY TRUE AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO I DO THINK THAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO BOTH PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CANDIDATES TO ALLOW FOR PROCESS. TO MAKE THAT A LITTLE BIT EASIER A BIT MORE EFFICIENT AND AND NOT AS COSTLY. ARM I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST CLARIFY THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE MY STAFF I HAVE WORKED THROUGH WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF. OF THEIR TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WE HAD PROPOSED ONE I UNDERSTAND THERE'S NO CONTROVERSY ON AND THAT IS. A REQUIREMENT THAT THE H. AWAY HAVE ADOPTED ELECTION RULES AS REQUIRED UNDER EXISTING LAW WHICH INCLUDES PROCEDURE FOR NOMINATIONS IN ORDER TO USE. THE ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION OPTION. WE HAD ALSO PROPOSED A LIMITATION ON ASIA WAYS TO HOLD. OUR. EVERY OTHER ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION TO AVOID CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH POTENTIALLY ALL ELECTIONS ARE MADE BY ACCLAMATION. THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF HAVE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT I AM OKAY WITH FOR THIS COMMITTEE MOVING FORWARD ALTHOUGH I DO THINK THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO CAN BE CONTINUE TO BE WORKED ON AND I SERVE ON THE. ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHICH THIS BILL WILL BE GOING TO NEXT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT BUT LET ME JUST. READ INTO THE RECORD. WE WOULD ADD LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THAT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT A ABORTED DIRECT ROUTE REQUIREMENT THAT ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE BE IN THE THIRTY DAY NOTICE. FOR THE ELECTION AND NOMINATION PROCEDURES THAT STATES THAT IF THERE AREN'T ENOUGH CANDIDATES THE ELECTION COULD BE DECIDED BY ACCLAMATION. AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPT A RESOLUTION AT A BOARD MEETING THAT FINDS AT THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES FOR THE BOARD. IS EQUAL TO THE VACANCY IS CREATED BY THE EXPIRING TERMS THE THE REASON FOR THIS LANGUAGE AGAIN IS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUES. THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM AS WELL AS PART OF WHAT I WOULD LIKE THE AUTHOR OF TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IN THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS THE IDEA THAT. WE DO WHERE POSSIBLE WANT TO FIND AND PUSH AND PROMOTE COMPETITIVE ELECTIONS AND A WE DON'T I THINK WANNA. SET UP LAWS THAT ALLOW THE SPORTS TO HAVE ACCLAMATION YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT. THAT I HAVE HAD SO ON WITH THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. UNPREPARED TO IT TO MOVE THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WAS CENTER ROTH THAT THAT'S. A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF. A GOOD BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN OUR STAFF OF THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL MISTER CHAIR GREAT. THANK YOU LET ME ASK OUR MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. DOCTOR CHOI. I DON'T THINK YOU SENATOR. I THOUGHT OUT IN USUALLY I I I JUST WAS SO RATHER SIMPLE. BR. SUGGESTING WHEN. NOT ENOUGH. CANDIDATES ARE. ELIGIBLE LAISSEZ THISA THREE YEAR POSITIONS AND ANYONE WHAT TO AND NOT TO SKIP THE. ELECTION PROCESS. IT U. IS THAT DOUBLE THE IN MY STILL UNDERSTANDING AND CONNECT TEST OF KATIE'S. WHAT ABOUT THE US TEA AND ARE? NOT ENOUGH. CANDIDATES SO. VOLUNTEER THAN THE HOW DO WE. ALLOW THE BOARD MEMBERS HAVE TO FEEL THAT THIS THAT. THEY ARE TORE USE OF A CANDIDATE AND THE THROUGH THE. AFFIRMATION THAT THEY WANTED OUT THEY WILL. CHOOSE TO BOARD MEMBERS IT IS THAT THE INTENT. DOCTOR YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THIS BILL ONLY DEALS WITH THE SITUATION WHERE AFTER OF. A NOMINATION PROCESS AND AND PUBLIC CITY PARKS PROCESS TO TRY TO RECRUIT TO. FOLKS TO THE BOARD WE ONLY HAVE YOU ONLY HAVE THREE CANDIDATES FOR THREE SLOTS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. ADDRESSES AMONG BUT FIRST I SHOULD COMMEND THE OPPOSITION TO HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION FOLKS I. HAVE I OWN PROPERTY IN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION IN MY PRAYER LIVES I HAVE SERVED ON THE BOARD I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES ON BOTH SIDES. OF THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT DETERMINING WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO VOTER WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO SERVE AS A DIRECTOR AND. YOU WILL NOTE FROM THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS MOST OF THE CONCERN. A SEEMS TO BE CENTERED AROUND ASSOCIATION AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ATTEMPT TO RESTRICT. MEMBERSHIP ON THE BOARD AND PROGRAM MEMBERSHIP ON THE BOARD AND THIS BILL DOES NOT TO DEAL WITH THAT. YOU IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE HEARING ANOTHER BILL NEXT WEEK BY ONE OF MY SENATE COLLEAGUES TO TO ATTEMPT TO DEAL SPECIFICALLY. WITH THAT ISSUE WHICH IS THE LEAD UP TO THE ELECTION PROCESS THIS BILL ONLY DEALS WITH THE POINT WHERE THE NOMINATION PROCESS IS OVER. THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES HAS BEEN DETERMINED AND THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES EQUALS THE NUMBER OF SLOTS ECONOLINE ES YES I RECOGNIZE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE. THE PRELIMINARY ISSUE AND THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT AS WELL. THE DANCE YOUR QUESTION SIR. OKAY A PARTICULARLY THAT ARE PUT OUT IF TO SOME FIVE MEMBER BOARD THAT IS NOT WHEN I'M OR ANTI OF FIVE. NOT THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY THAT THOUGHT WHAT'S THREE YEAH YEAH EACH TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS. WHEN WHEN THERE ARE THREE VERY. THREE POSITIONS ARE UP BUT AND. TWENTY ONE. CANDIDATE THAT ONE APPLICANT. IT SUPPLY. AND IF TO SO. STILL. TOO THEY COOKED AND HOW DO WE FEEL IS THAT THE TO. THE ACTING POSITION THAT'S MY QUESTION. SO THE THE. THE BILL DOES NOT GIVE THE BOARD OF FORTY TWO APPOINT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT NOMINATED THEMSELVES ARE BEEN NOMINATED. OUGHT TO RUN FOR THE BOARD IT HIT IT. IF AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS SO. YOU'LL YOU'LL BE ABLE DOES NOT DETER WITH THAT HOW TO FEEL THAT. THOSE SHORTAGE OF TWO POSITIONS CORRECT CORRECT UNDER THE MUNICIPAL STATUTE WHERE YOU HAVE ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION THERE IS AN OPTION FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO ON BEHALF OF WHITE PERFORMING ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO APPLY. RIGHT RIGHT YEAH THAT ONE I CAN BE OUR OWN YES THIS BILL DOES NOT ONLY THAT NO PROBLEM BUT THE. THE REMAINING TWO POSITIONS ARE LACKING THAT AND OUT TO THE OPERATE THOUGH WITH THE. THREE MEMBER BOARD. OR HOW DO WE. ENCOURAGE THEM TO FEEL GOOD. TO. LACKING VACANCIES YES THIS BILL DOES NOT SPEAK TO THOSE TO ADD THOSE TWO VACANCIES THAT WERE NOT FILLED. AYE DOES NOT GIVE THE BOARD AUTHORITY TO A POINT THAT THAT IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION ILLUSTRATE THE WHEN THE UP PAID THE THAT NUMBER BY APPLICANTS ARE. EQUALLY Y. LAST SECOND I SKIPPED A BEAT DOT THE ELECTION PROCESS CORRECT OKAY A GOD THINK. THANK AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY TO. THE SENATE AUTHOR SENT AUTHORS POINT WE WILL BE HEARING A BILL NEXT WEEK BY CENTER WHITE HOUSE SKI THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY. THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA. A HOMEOWNERSHIP. ASSOCIATION AROUND. SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF. INDIVIDUALS BEING DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN FOR THE BOARD SO WE WILL CERTAINLY BE TACKLING THIS ISSUE NEXT WEEK BUT MR GLORY LET ME GO BACK TO. SLEEP THINKING OF A SHARED AND I WAS GONNA BRING ON THAT POINT BECAUSE I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY OF. OF SOME OF THE POOREST OF THIS BILL RECOGNIZING THAT WE MAYBE HAVE OPPORTUNITY ADDRESS THAT SOON BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL I APPRECIATE THE CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH A CHAIR. ANY PARTICULARLY IN REALLY A MAKING SURE IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WITH THE ADOPTION OF A RESOLUTION. TO ALL INVOLVED THAT THERE'S THIS MAY HAPPENS I HONESTLY THIS BILL BECOMES MOOT. IF MOST WHAT CAN THAT STEP FORWARD LINK OUT AS SOMEBODY SERVE ON THE CITY COUNCIL IS OFTEN TOLD THAT WAS A TOUGH JOB I WOULD ALWAYS ANSWER. BEYOND A CHILE IS EVEN HARDER. AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE MEDICINES TO GET INVOLVED I LIKE THE CHAIR AND I THINK LIKE THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LOT OF COMPETITION IN THESE RACES. UP BUT ULTIMATELY I HAVE A STRONG CONCERN ABOUT THE OVERALL COST OF H. AWAY FEES AND WHAT THAT MEANS A TO HOMEOWNERSHIP IN OUR STATE. AND IF THERE'S AN EFFICIENCY THE TABLE TO BE ACHIEVED A PARTICULAR WITH THE LACK OF COMPETITION. THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY I WOULD KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN THE TO THE FIVE CITIES IN MY DISTRICT. HAD TO CANCEL THE LAST ELECTIONS FOR LACK OF A COMPETITIVE RACES. IF WE CAN DO IT FOR MUNICIPALITIES I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT WOULD APPLY TO EACH WAYS. IT WOULD BE A GRADUAL CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK COMPETITION IS GREAT BUT IT'S THE REALITY BEHIND OUR SELVES AND I'LL MOVE THE BILL. AND LOOK WHAT ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE IN JUDICIARY ON THE FLOOR CHARACTERS MOTION MOVE IS OUR SECOND. SECOND BY DOCTOR WOULD UP WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION BY THE COMMITTEE. HER CENTER GIVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I THINK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE INCINERATION GREAT THANK YOU SO THERE IS A MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION IN ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHIU AYE CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I CHAO. CHAO AYE CHILI AYE CHOI AYE GLORIA. GLORIA I WE MONTH. THE MONTH I WOULD. WOULD DIE SENATOR BILLS OUT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WE'LL GO NOW TO FILE ITEM THREE CENTER SKINNER SP TWELVE. SEVEN. GOOD MORNING. MORNING THANK YOU I CHAIR AND MEMBERS. S. B. TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN ALLOWS. HOUSING THAT IS BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOR STUDENTS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE STATE'S DENSITY BONUS. HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WHOSE NEEDS. STUDENT HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ARE. HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT NEEDS THAN OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE ARE. STATE BONUS OUR STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW IS BASED ON UNITS. VERY OFTEN A STUDENT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION LIKE A DORM. HAS. ROOMS OR MULTIPLE BEDS. A SINGLE COMMON KITCHEN OR PERHAPS A WHAT SINGLE BATHROOM ON THE FLOOR. AND NOT WHAT ONE CONSIDERS TYPICAL UNITS SO GIVEN THAT CONFIGURATION. IT IS SO FAR BEEN UNABLE FOR THOSE DEVELOPERS OF PROJECTS THAT ARE HUNDRED PERCENT FOR STUDENT HOUSING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CALIFORNIA'S DENSITY BONUS. KNOW WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS MAKE THE STUDENT HOUSING ELIGIBLE IF IT IS DEDICATED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. FOR STUDENTS STUDENTS MUST BE ENROLLED IN THE WESTERN ASSOCIATION. OF SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS OR THE EQUIVALENT FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THAT A MINIMUM OF TWENTY PERCENT OF THE UNITS BE DEDICATED. TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS VIA FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY AND I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEVELOPER TO PROVIDE PROOF OF A. OPERATING AGREEMENT OR MASTER LEASE THAT SHOWS THAT IT'S POOR STUDENT HOUSING. AND I AM DELETING THE OPTION AROUND. PROOF OF FAMILY INCOME. AS. RECOMMENDED BY THE. COMMITTEE SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TWO WITNESSES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRED SURE MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL REPRESENT THE TOP EMPLOYERS IN THE NINE COUNTY. OF FAIR REGION A WHICH IS ALSO HOME TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NBA CHAMPIONS THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS. YOU KNOW ARE ARE ARE EMPLOYERS HAVE TOLD US THAT. CREATE A SKILLED WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE THE TOP PRIORITY FOR THEM AND IS OUR CHALLENGE BECAUSE TWO THOUSAND SO DIFFICULT. THAT IT'S THAT. THE WE HAVE SO MANY STUDENTS LEAVING AND GOING TO OTHER STATES FOR THEIR EDUCATION NOT COME TO CALIFORNIA. NOT STAYING HERE BECOMING ENTREPRENEURS BECOME A PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS ARE SOCIETY ON WOULD LIKE TO APPLAUD CENTER SKINNER FOR LEADERSHIP. WHAT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE TWO HOUSES OF PARAMOUNT ISSUE FOR THE BAY AREA FOR CALIFORNIA A WHISPER BECAUSE WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS. EXCUSE ME MARK MCDONALD MCCALLUM GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTHILL DE ANZA KERN AND PERALTA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ALSO WANTED TO WEIGH IN. ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUE. WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA THE THE TRADE GROUP REPRESENTS ALL SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. HE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY BUT. AFFORDABILITY AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS MORE THAN JUST. FEES AND HOUSING IS A MAJOR PART OF THAT. I THINK THE ANALYSIS DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF POINTING OUT THE NEED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL FOR THIS BILL. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE'S ONLY A FEW COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE DORMS SO THIS PROVIDES A SOLUTION IN LIEU OF DORMS FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WE WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU. OTHER SUPPORTERS. GOOD MORNING ASSISTANCE AND ONLY AFTER CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS. TIFFANY FAN OF HOW THE BRIDGE HOUSING IN SUPPORT. LOUIS BROWN TABBY HAVE OF CALIFORNIAN BE IT'S PART. ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I JUST WANNA START BY THANKING THE SENATOR FOR MOVING FORWARD. AT SUCH AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO YET ANOTHER FACET OF OUR STATE HOUSING CRISIS I THINK ALL OF US HAVE SEEN. THE HOUSING CRISIS IMPACTING. NOT JUST FAMILIES NOTJUST WORKERS BUT CERTAINLY STUDENTS AND I THINK THIS IS A. INTERESTING WAY OF GOING AT IT AND ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE WHICH I'LL JUST NOTE BECAUSE OF TIMING ISSUES WILL NOT BE TAKEN HERE BUT WILL BE TAKEN AND. ARE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHEN THIS BILLS IN THAT COMMITTEE SHORTLY IF THAT IS THE WILL OF THIS COMMITTEE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER COMMENTS DR WOULD. SO I THINK THIS BE A EXCELLENT BILL FOR THIS GOLDEN STATE LIKE TO MOVE IT. RIGHT MOTION MOVED THERE'S BEEN A SECOND ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION. OKAY. OKAY I HAVE A QUESTION. DOCTOR CHOI. OKAY AYE UP ONE ON WHAT WHAT THE AMENDMENTS. IT DID YOU UP OPPOSE SO A SO THE AMENDMENTS ARE ACTUALLY A HIGHLIGHTED IN WELL I REALIZE HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ONE WOULD DELETE THE OPTION. OF PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE PROOF OF INCOME TO QUALIFY FOR LOWER INCOME UNITS OR PUT A DIFFERENT WAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO REALLY NEED. THAT HELP TO LIVE IN AND AND THESE UNITS THE OTHER REQUIRES A DEVELOPER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE. THAT THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO PROVIDE A TO STUDENTS TO LIVE IN THE DEVELOPMENT SO. THE SECOND REQUIREMENT SAYS THE DEVELOPER ARE YOU REALLY BUILDING STUDENT HOUSING AND HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH LOCAL UNIVERSITIES TO DO SO SO WE'RE REALLY. UP PUTTING BELTS AND SUSPENDERS REQUIREMENTS BOTH ON THE STUDENT SIDE AS WELL AS ON THE DEVELOPER SIDE SO THAT IT STUDENTS WHO WHO NEED TO LIVE IN THE US AND IT'S A DEVELOPER WHO IS COMMITTED. TO DOING THIS WORK WITH A SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. OKAY I HAVE A LOT TO QUESTIONS. NOT TO SENATOR ON THE MOON IS THAT. I ASSUME THAT THIS UP BILL WOULD APPLY TO THE DEVELOPMENTS ARE. OH FIVE HOUSING OUTSIDE OF THE CAMPUS YES YES BECAUSE INSIDE IS SO UP TO THE UNIVERSITY CORRECT AND THEY AND AT LEAST ARE. PUBLICLY OWNED UNIVERSITIES AND HEARD AND DEPENDING ON THEIR STATUS DON'T. DON'T NEED THIS RELIEF BECAUSE. THEY CAN APPLY THEIR OWN. IT YEAH UNIVERSITY WOULD SET UP BUT THEY OWN REGULATIONS OKAY NUMBER TWO IS THAT I THOUGHT OF THIS ARE A SPECIFIC. THE OUR LOW INCOME HOUSING AND A THIRTY FIVE PERCENT THE ATTEND STEVE WARNER SO IS IN EFFECT A IN OUR END OF THE. STATUTES IS THAT TRUE. YES THE DENSITY BONUS IS IN STATUTE BUT IT'S BASED ON UNITS AND AS I DESCRIBE IN MY OPENING. CONFIGURATION OF STUDENT HOUSING. ONE COULD CONSIDER A DORM. I'D IN EFFECT EITHER ONE UNIT OR IT COULD TAKE AT BECAUSE THAT. WHOLE DOOR MIGHT HAVE ONLY ONE KITCHEN. AND THREE BATHROOMS. SO WITH THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW THE DENSITY BONUS ON EITHER BEDS. OR BEDROOMS. SO. YOU'RE NOT. M. MAKE THE DISTINCTION ANY ARE A STUDENT HOUSING. OUT WILL HAVE A. NO SIMILAR TESTIMONY SHREK CORRECT. NICK. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SEEING NONE ALL* CENTER HERE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. ONLY SAY THAT I DID NOT MENTION MY OPENING BUT IT WAS REFERRED OBVIOUSLY IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND BY THE. WITNESSES AND SUPPORT THAT. RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING COSTS FOR MANY STUDENTS IS BEING NUMBER ONE FINANCIAL PRESSURE. AND SO THAT WHILE THIS WILL NOT COMPLETELY SOLVE THAT IT CERTAINLY WILL HELP BECAUSE IT GIVES. SOME DEVELOPERS IN MOTIVATION TO BUILD HOUSING JUST FOR STUDENTS SO WITH THAT I ASK BROUGH. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHU. CHU AYE MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN NIGHT CHAO. SHALL I CHOI GAI CHILE I GLORIA. GLORIA AYE IN THE MONTH. THE MONEY I WOULD. WOULD I. SENATOR DOLE'S UP. WITH ONE FINAL ITEM TODAY. AND THAT IS. YET WHEN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO DO THE CONSENT ITEM WHICH IS FILE ITEM FOR SP ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE BY DECK IS OUR MOTION TO MOVE. UP MOTION BY DR WOULD SECONDED BY MISTER GLORIA. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DIDN'T DO PASSED THE CONSENT. CHIU BY TWO I MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN NIGHT CHAU. JOE Y. CHILLY. CHILLY I GLORIA GLORY I IN THE MONTH. NUMAN I WOULD. GOOD I THE CONSENT ITEMS OUT NOW OUR FINAL ITEM FILE ITEM ONE S. B. TEN SIXTEEN SIR ALAN WELCOME. PAGE SO MUCH MEMBERS APPRECIATE IT I THIS ISSUE COMES UP AS A RESPONSE TO OF A REAL PROBLEM THAT EXISTS FOR SOME FOLKS AROUND THE STATE. IVERSON I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON ON THIS BILL. I HAD THIS BILL SEEKS TO HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS CLIMATE AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION COSTS BY ELIMINATING OBSTACLES THAT. COULD PREVENT CONDOMINIUM RESIDENTS FROM ACCESSING ELECTRIC VEHICLE. CHARGING STATIONS SAYS EVERYBODY KNOWS CALIFORNIA HAS AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS SET FORTH IN AB THIRTY TWO IN S. B.. THIRTY TWO AND. UNDER THOSE GOALS THE STATE HAS TO NOW DO MORE TO LIMIT THE BARRIERS OF. THAT MAY EXIST WITH REGARDS TO ELECTRIC VEHICLE OWNERSHIP. NOW THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT OUTSIDE THE CALIFORNIA WILL PUT FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC CARS ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY MAKE SOLVING THIS PROBLEM EVEN MORE URGENT. I KNOW WHAT THE PRICE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAS BEEN STEADILY DECREASING. THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS CONTINUES. TO BE AN ISSUE. NOW RESIDENTS WHO BELONG TO HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS AND CONDOMINIUM COMPLEXES OFTEN FIND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO USE. COMMON AREA SPACES TO INSTALL THE NEEDED CHARGING OF STRUCTURE I HAPPEN TO HAVE. OUR OWN LITTLE GARAGE SO I CAN PLUG AYE WE THAT I HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER SO I CAN PLUG MY. A MY. ARE CHARGER INTO THE INTO OUR OWN WALL THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN COLLECTIVE SPACES WHERE THEY'RE USING CHANGING. I'VE PARKING SPACES HAVE SOME CHALLENGES IN THIS RESPECT. NO CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS A HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION FROM UNREASONABLY RESTRICTING A RESIDENTS ABILITY TO INSTALL A CHARGING STATION AT THEIR OWN COST BUT IT'S SILENT REGARDING THE REMAINING NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING THE TIME OF USE METER THAT MAKES EVEY IS MORE ECONOMICAL SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP TOMORROW BY PROHIBITING. HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS FROM RESTRICTING THE ABILITY RESIDENTS TO INSTALL A TIME OF USE METER. AND A COMPANY INFRASTRUCTURE IN A COMMON AREA WHERE THEIR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION IS LOCATED THE BILL PASS OF THE SENATE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IT RECEIVED NO. NO VOTES IT HAS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION WE WORK CAREFULLY TO. MAKE SURE THAT IT'S. VERY TARGETED TO THIS PARTICULAR CHALLENGE IN AND I ASKED YOU ABOUT. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. I MISSED CARE MEMBERS BOATBUILDER A BEHALF TESLA MOTORS IN SPORT THINK. MR TURN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND SUPPORT. AND LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS. MOTION WITH THE BILL AND THERE'S A SECOND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE. SENATE AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD AND. APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A STRICT FOR BILL AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ALSO BEEN TRYING TO CHAMPION MORE INSTALLATIONS OF PHOEBE CHARGING STATIONS. ARE APPLAUD THIS AND IF YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADD ADDITIONAL CO AUTHORS OF THE HAPPY BE ADDED. SALINAS WITH THAT UNLESS THERE'S ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS UP MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DOCTOR CHOI. YEAH WELL NO QUESTION. IT WAS JUST A DOG WITH A YA* AWAY WHY NOT BLOW. WHAT CAN WE BELIEVE AT THIS COME UP WITH A PLAN NOW REQUIRE MY STEP CLOSER EVERY HOMEOWNER WILL? THEIR COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT AREA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION NOT WOULD HAVE THIER. A BOARD MEMBER SAYS SITUATIONS WOULD BE OR DIFFERENT THAT THEY CAN DECIDE THAT WHY DO WE HAVE TO. I INTERVENED THEY OWN LOCAL AUTHORITY. SO THE ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THEM THE QUESTION OF TIME OF USE METERS. AND SO. IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE HAVING MANY PROBLEMS AROUND THE STATE I THINK IF YOU LOOK YOU KNOW. AS YOU KNOW I SERVE ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE SIDE. THERE A LOT OF INTEREST GROUPS TO COME IN IF THEY FEEL AS THOUGH A BILL HAVE YOU. CREATES ONEROUS OVERREGULATION OF HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS CASE WE'VE MET WITH THEM WE TALK TO THEM AND AND AND THEY DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH THIS IS ONEROUS. BUT BUT ONLY ULTIMATELY IT'S IMPORTANT SO THAT IF THERE'S ANY BIT BASICALLY IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO REACH THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE. WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVING IN COMMON USE PARKING. CONDOMINIUMS HAVE ACCESS TO TIME OF USE METER MEASURES. AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO BARRIERS TO. TO THE ACCESS TO THE THAT THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NEEDED. I MEAN YOU KNOW I THINK THE CONCERNS I I'M A MEMBER OF ANY CHOI SOMETIMES YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE STILL NOT QUITE OF A OF A WHERE. BATTAGLIA'S AS ELECTRIC CARS ARE GETTING MORE MORE POPULAR IT'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO JUST HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO. HAVE A MUCH REQUIRED IT TO CHARGE IT I'M. AND IN THE NEEDS NOT BE SENSITIVE TO THE. THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF ELECTRIC CARS. SO AS I SAY WE'VE WE'VE. ARE MAKING YOU KNOW JUST AS WELL AS I THAT THERE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF BILLS THAT THAT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION COMMUNITY OBJECT TO YOU BECAUSE THEY FEEL AS THOUGH THERE'S MICROMANAGEMENT IN THIS CASE. I THEY DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH THAT'S THE CASE. IT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF. COMMON CHARGING STATION. SO THIS ALL HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY PRICES VARY BY THE TIME OF DAY. AND SO THEIR FOLKS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE. I DID THERE BEING PROPERLY CHARGED. NO PUN INTENDED I'VE FOR. FOR THE ELECTRICITY THEY'RE USING BASED ON THE TIME OF DAY THAT THEY'RE USING IT SO CAN BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO CHARGE YOUR CAR AT CERTAIN TIMES OF DAY THAN OTHER TIMES TODAY SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART. OF MAKING SURE THAT THE. OTHER THE CHARGING PROCESS IS ECONOMICAL FOR FOLKS SO YOU'LL BE IN IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO CHARGE ANY TIME. WELL THE VERY LEAST IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT TO BE ABLE TO TRACK AND BE PROPERLY CHARGE FOR THE. THAT THE THE ELECTRICITY USED THAT THERE. TAKING FROM THE SYSTEM TO CHARGE OUR CARS BASED ON THE TIME OF DAY THAT THEY'RE DOING. SO YOU BELIEVE SO TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER WILL ARE HARDER OF IT I MEAN WE'RE TRYING MAKE IT EASIER FOR THESE FOR THESE DRIVERS ABSOLUTELY. DIDN'T TO MAKE IT YOU KNOW. TO TURN TO DID IT GIVE THEM ANOTHER TOOL. I HAD TO TO UNDERSTAND AND BE ABLE TO CHARGE THEIR CARS IN AN ECONOMICAL MANNER TO UNDERSTAND ELECTRICITY PRICES ASSOCIATED WITH CHARGING AND. MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING IT TIMES A DAY WHEN. WHEN ONE IS LESS EXPENSIVE IF THEY WANT TO. ECONOMICAL MAN I MEAN IS THAT THE YOU ARE TRYING TO RESTRICT IT'LL TO CHARGE A AFTER MIDNIGHT. NO THEY CAN CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANT BUT THE BUT THE TIME OF USE METER MONITORS WHEN THEY'RE CHARGING AND HOW THEY'RE CHARGING IN THE COMMAND OF. OF OF CHARGES ARE USING. AND THEY CAN THEN BE. CHARGED FINANCIALLY ARE. YOU KNOW I BASED ON ON THEIR USAGE BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO USE MANNER. THERE'S NO OUR WAY OF MONITORING THE ELECTRICITY USE THAT YOU ARE USING TWO I HAD TO CHARGE A CAR. YOU THERE'S NO THERE'S NO WAY TO MONITOR THE FACT THAT DID THAT YOU CHARGE DURING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME IS THIS AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AND SO YOU ARE TO BE CHARGED A CERTAIN AMOUNT. BECAUSE WE CHARGE WE CHARGE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR ELECTRICITY YOU SPACE ON THE DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY YEAH I KNOW SO SO PEOPLE CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN CHARGE AT NIGHT YOU COULD CHARGE AND THAT YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. BUT IF YOU HAVE A TIME OF USE METER. IT ALLOWS YOU TO BE PROPERLY. CHARGE FOR FOR THAT FOR THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY VIEWS IN THE TIME OF DAY YOU'VE USED IT. SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THERE'S NO BARRIERS TO THE. IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE. MY DO I NEED THAT THE. A TIME UP TO YOU SAW. THOUGH IT MONITORING UNITA IF I IF I PAY MORE. ANYTIME I CHARGE. RIGHT SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IN FACT GREAT SHOW A ACTUALLY HAS A MESSAGES I MEAN DEPENDING ON HOW THEY. USE THEIR. DEPENDING HOW THEY STRUCTURE THEIR ELECTRICITY CHARGES FOR THAT FOR COMMON SPACES THEY SOMETIMES WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. ARE YOU ARE IF YOU'RE USING A LOT OF ELECTRICITY DOWN THE COMMON SPACE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WELL THAT. THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHO'S USING AND WHEN. BUT THE FACT IS FOR BETTER FOR WORSE AND IN YOU WE CAN DISCUSS THIS AS EVERYONE KNOWS IN THE ENERGY SPACE. WE DO CHARGE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR DIFFERENT TIMES A DAY. OF ELECTRICITY USE. YOU KNOW I SOLAR GETS MORE AND MORE ONLINE. IT ACTUALLY I THINK IN SOME RESPECTS MAKES SENSE TO START TO FLIP THE MODEL I BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN EXCESS OF ENERGY DURING THE TILL THE DAY. AND AND AND IT DE AND AND NOT AT NIGHT BUT RIGHT NOW BASED ON THE OLD. THE OLD SYSTEM WERE STILL CHARGING PEOPLE MORE FOR ELECTRICITY USE. DURING THE DAY THAN AT NIGHT. AND THAT'S A BROADER KIND OF PROBLEM THAT I LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON. SOME MEMBER IF THAT'S OF INTEREST. THANK YOU UNLESS THERE'S ANY FURTHER COMMENT CENTER DE OF ANY FINAL CLOSING COMMENTS RECEIVED THE DISCUSSION IN THE QUESTIONS ADMITTED TO ME WITH YOUR OFFICE TO TALK TO MORE ABOUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND DONE. YES IT'S COMMON SENSE. REDUCTION OF A OF A OF A POTENTIAL BARRIER. IS TO ALLOW THE STATE TO GROW ITS. AND SAT IT'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE FLEET IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH THE PRIVATE MARKET. AND WITH THAT I RESPECT CAST MY VOTE GREAT NO OPPOSITION THANK YOU FOR THE. WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
