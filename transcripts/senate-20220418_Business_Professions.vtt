BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY EIGHT. I'VE

SAID DR THANK YOU IT'S JUST A

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:19.257
QUESTION ABOUT THE ONE OF THE

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:20.826
FIRST AUTHOR AMENDMENTS WHICH

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:23.261
WAS SAID TWO POINT EXACTLY WHAT

00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:25.130
EXEMPTS FROM PROVISIONS OF STATE

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:28.066
CIVIL SERVICE ACT. WHAT DOES NOT

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:31.069
CLARIFY THE REASON FOR EXEMPTING

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.137
THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM THE

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:37.209
CIVIL SERVICE ACT. I'VE BEEN

00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:39.177
INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.178
EMPLOYEES ARE EXEMPT AS

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:43.515
PHYSICIANS. OKAY ALL EMPLOYEES

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:45.417
OF THIS BORDER ALL BOARDS ARE

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:48.820
EXEMPT FROM CIVIL SERVICE ACT.

00:24:48.887 --> 00:25:03.268
CAN YOU ACTUALLY GET. BUT.

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:12.611
OKAY. OKAY ALL RIGHT AT A VERY

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:15.513
BRIEF I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER-

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.349
YOU KNOW THE ONE REASONS I RAISE

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:19.584
THE QUESTION IS JUST THAT- YOU

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:21.419
TOO MANY TIMES AGENCIES HAVE

00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:24.489
REQUESTED- PARTICULAR. A

00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:26.358
RESIDENT AGENCIES TO BE EXEMPT

00:25:26.424 --> 00:25:27.325
FROM CIVIL SERVICE ACT FOR THE

00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:28.760
PURPOSE OF ACTUALLY PAYMENT

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:30.662
SALLY STILL DIFFERENT THAN THE

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:33.231

TWELVE THAT MAY BE NECESSARY AT

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.268
TIMES I THINK THAT ALSO RAISES

00:25:36.334 --> 00:25:37.269
THE QUESTION IF THAT HAPPENS SO

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:39.337
FREQUENTLY THAT WE NEED TO

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:40.672
REVISIT THE CIVIL SERVICE SALARY

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:41.840
SCALE AS WE CAN BE COMPETITIVE

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:43.441
AS A STATE. SO I JUST WANT TO

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:45.110
CLARIFY THAT BUT- I APPRECIATE

00:25:45.176 --> 00:25:46.211
THE FACT THAT THE EXECUTIVE

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:48.179

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:50.315

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.523
AGO WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THE

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:10.726
COST. OF THAT THE INDUSTRY WOULD

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.261
WOULD BE FACING BECAUSE OF THE

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.263
TAXES AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT WE

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.032
ALSO I DON'T THINK WE REALIZED

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:17.667
THE NUMBER OF IT OF ILLEGAL.

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:20.837
FARMS AND- IN THE STATE- NOT

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:22.505
JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.340
THROUGHOUT THE OTHER STAGE SO

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.042
I'M I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN TAKE

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:27.677
ANOTHER GOOD LOOK AT THIS AND-

01:02:27.743 --> 01:02:29.378
AND SENATOR IF YOU WOULD.

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.780
PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE LOOK INTO

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.582
THAT TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS SO

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.784
WE CAN'T FIGHT DELICIOUS. THE

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:38.554
LEGAL- GROWERS AND- AND HELP THE

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.456
INDUSTRY DO WHAT WAS AFTER

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:43.359
ACCOMPLISH AND- TO MAKE ENOUGH

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.627
MONEY FOR THEMSELVES BUT ALSO

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:48.364
PRODUCE INCOME FOR THE STATE.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.599

DIVERSIONS. AND UP-

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:58.541
ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CAUSED

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.210
BY THE ILLEGAL GROWS AND SO I

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.112
THINK IF WE PUT A NOTE ON A

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.281
NUMBER OF PIECES IN PLACE. WE

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.216
CAN DO A LOT TO REDUCE THE

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.986

AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:04.900
WOULD ENTER INTO ON BEHALF OF

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.202
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.837
REQUIRE THAT ANY LICENSING

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:10.106
RESTRICTIONS THAT WE HAVE. ON

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:13.109
OUR OWN LICENSEES WOULD WOULD-

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:16.312
HAVE TO BE. MIRRORED IN THE

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:17.480
JURISDICTION THAT WERE DOING

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.715

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:30.593
IT'S A TWO WAY. TO A STREET-

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.361
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS IN

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.764
REGARDS TO THE OVER DRAFTED

BASINS ON WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.534
THERE ARE ILLEGAL GROWS

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.970
HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE-

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:46.075
AS- FAR AS UP. UP IN- THAT

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:47.576
NORTHERN MOST PART OF THE STATE

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.845
CLOSE TO OREGON ALL THE WAY DOWN

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:52.581
TO- THAT MEXICO BORDER AND THE

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:56.352
ESTIMATES ARE THAT HUNDREDS. OF

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:59.555
THOUSANDS. OF GALLONS OF-

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.023
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT YALA'S BECAUSE

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.092
THEY USE ACRE FEET AS THE AS THE

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:05.561
MEASUREMENT- ARE BEING DIVERTED

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.564
IN ORDER TO. EFFECTUATE THESE

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.701
GROWS- AND SO- PART OF THE

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:14.103
CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS TO HAVE A

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.105
GOOD ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO BE

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:19.575
ABLE TO GO IN. AND TO SHUT DOWN

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.610
THESE ILLEGAL GROWS. THAT WILL

01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:23.479
MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:25.948
OUR WATER SUPPLY- A LOT OF THE

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:29.719
WATER THAT- THAT ENDS UP IN OUR

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:31.721
RIVERS IS NOT. GETTING THERE SO

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:35.391
THE DELTA IS SHORTED. HUNDREDS

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:38.260
OF. OF ACRE FEET ARE HUNDREDS TO

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.729
THOUSANDS OF ACRE FEET EVERY

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.897
YEAR AND YET WE'RE TAKING FROM

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:43.866
WE'RE NOT DOING WATER DELIVERIES

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.234
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:46.268
BECAUSE THE DELTA DOESN'T HAVE

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.738
ANY WATER SO- THIS IS ONE OF OUR

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:51.540
OUR SOLUTIONS IS TO- ONE OF OUR

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.776
WATER SOLUTIONS IS TO REALLY

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.311
STOP THE ILLEGAL DIVERSION

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:56.846
BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF. A

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:59.582
MARIJUANA GROWS IN ADDITION TO

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:00.950
THE WATER BEING IMPACTED YOU

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:04.253
HAVE- POLLUTION AS WELL AS

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.222
UNREGULATED- PESTICIDES AND

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:07.390
HERBICIDES ARE USED ON THESE

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:10.025
GROSS SO THAT ALSO CONTAMINATES

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:12.328
THE WATER IN THE WELLS- AS WELL

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:13.662
SO THE THEFT WATER BECOMES

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.197
IMPORTANT THIS BILL DOESN'T DEAL

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:17.733
WITH THAT BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.335

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:22.571
TO OUR WATER SYSTEM THAT WE- WE

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:26.041

AGRICULTURAL LAND HOLDINGS. I

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.200

01:41:18.539 --> 01:41:19.907
PERFUSED GENERALLY DONE UNDER

01:41:19.973 --> 01:41:21.842
THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS I'M

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:23.544
WONDERING WHY DO A BILL VERSUS

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:25.345
JUST LOOKING AT THIS IN THE

01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:27.481
SENSE THAT PROCESS. BECAUSE WE

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:28.582
DON'T KNOW BUT WE WOULDN'T WANT

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:31.318
ANY AM ANYMORE TO TAKE A BIG HIT

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:34.421
AS WE KNOW THE LICENSE FEES

THE EXPERT EXCELLENT QUESTION I

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:39.359
THINK THE REASON WE'RE PUTTING

01:41:39.426 --> 01:41:41.128
THIS FOURTH RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:42.796

AND- AND- WAY- SPEEDIER WAY I

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:50.304
SHOULD SAY- AND I THINK THE

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:52.072
REASON FOR IT RIGHT NOW. THE

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:53.207
REASON WE'RE MOVING IT THROGH

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:55.375
IS BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A NEED

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:56.143
RIGHT NOW WITH- THE

TO BE SURE TO HAVE THE TIME.

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:13.360
INSTEAD OF. COMPLETELY

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:15.329

ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BOARDS

BUT I ALSO HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:07.648
TRYING TO DO N. COURSES DURING

01:43:07.714 --> 01:43:09.249
OUR SUNSET REVIEW ONE OF THINGS

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:11.485
WE DO LOOK AT WE LOOK AT THE

01:43:11.552 --> 01:43:13.253
VARIOUS BUDGETS OF THE BOARDS

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.388
INCLUDING HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON

01:43:14.454 --> 01:43:17.925
ENFORCEMENT RIGHT- SO- I THINK

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.826
IT'S- I THINK THE BILLS WORTH.

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.295
LOOKING AT I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:23.630
IS THAT THE 50% SHOULD SHOULD

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:25.232
REALLY BE PERHAPS MORE ADJUSTED

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:26.600
FOR THE FACT THAT. YOU MADE THE

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:28.235
BOARD SAID THEY HAVE TO STILL

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:29.436
SPEND OF COURSE MONEY FOR

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:30.537
CERTIFICATION AND SO FORTH THAT

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:33.006
WE WOULD WANT TO LEAVE THAT.

01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:34.775
AMOUNT INTACT BUT SAY THAT WELL

01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:35.542

01:43:35.609 --> 01:43:37.711
ENFORCEMENT PARTS- WHICH THINGS

01:43:37.778 --> 01:43:39.746
WHICH ARE USING SOCIAL PRACTICE.

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:41.281
AT THAT EXPENSE WOULD BE

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:43.250
REDUCTIONS SINCE THAT WOULD NOT

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:45.319
BE THE BURDEN ON THE POOR

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:46.520
FACILITIES AN ACTIVE- TO THAT

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:48.322
DEGREE. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:50.057
MIGHT BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT WE

01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:51.992
WILL BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT THE

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.226
FEE WE LOOKED AT 50% JUST

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:54.328
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:56.163
BE. A CONSERVATIVE. JUST THE

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:57.965
HALFWAY POINT AS TO THE COST

01:43:58.031 --> 01:43:59.566

SOMEBODY THAT IS ACTUALLY

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:07.441
ACTIVE. THAT'S WHAT WE CAME UP

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:08.408
WITH THE FIFTY WE JUST THOUGHT

CONCERNS. SIR I WILL SAY THIS I

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:32.666
DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE

01:44:32.733 --> 01:44:33.367
AN INACTIVE STATUS WHEN YOU HAVE

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:57.224
