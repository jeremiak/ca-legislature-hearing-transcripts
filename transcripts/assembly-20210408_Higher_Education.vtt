MADE TO SOLVE THOSE

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:27.277
DEFICIENCIES. ALSO BY WAY OF

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:28.745
UPDATE TO THE COMMITTEE WE

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.314
RECENTLY PUBLISHED OUR SIX

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.415
MONTH UPDATE ON THE

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:33.183
UNIVERSITY'S PROGRESS ON OUR

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.319
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE HAVE

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:36.486
FOUND THAT THE UNIVERSITY STILL

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:37.988
HAS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THAT

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.423
IT NEEDS TO MAKE TO ADDRESS THE

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:42.492
PROBLEMS THAT WE FOUND. NO AB

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.026
TWO THIRTY THREE ADDRESSES

00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:43.961
QUITE A NUMBER OF THOSE

00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:45.395
DEFICIENCIES AND ADOPTS MANY OF

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:46.663
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS I'LL

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.333
HIGHLIGHT TO FOR THE COMMITTEE

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:49.866
AND THEN TAKE QUESTIONS AS

00:47:49.933 --> 00:47:51.101
NEEDED. ONE OF FOCUS FIRST ON

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:53.303
THE AREA APPLICANT EVALUATION

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.271
WHERE AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:56.173
JUST MENTIONED. WE FOUND THAT

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.941
AN APPLICANT'S CHANCES OF

00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:59.309
GETTING A HIGH SCORE OR A LOW

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:00.944
SCORE ON THEIR APPLICATION WERE

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:02.980
UNDULY DUE TO. WHICH

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:05.082
APPLICATION REVIEW WHERE THEY

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:06.750
HAPPEN TO BE ASSIGNED TO. THAT

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:08.485
LOOKS ALTADENA INCONSISTENT AND

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.420
UNFAIR PROCESS FOR APPLICANT

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:12.322
EVALUATION BECAUSE THE CAMPUS

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.124
HAS HAD NOT ADOPTED MONITORING

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:16.226
PROCESSES. TO ENSURE

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:17.561
PROFICIENCY THROUGHOUT THE

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:19.563
ENTIRE APPLICATION CYCLE AND

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.098
OUR SIX MONTH REVIEW SHOWS THAT

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.132
SEVERAL CAMPUSES ARE STILL

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.067
BEHIND IN THAT AREA THEY HAVE

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:25.602
NOT ADOPTED SUFFICIENT.

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:27.971
SOLUTIONS TO THAT PROBLEM. THIS

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.673
BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.041
SECOND ISSUE ALL COVER FOR THE

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:31.575
COMMITTEE AND THEN TAKE

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:32.743
QUESTIONS AS THE AREA

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:34.878
APPLICANTS SELECTION. WE FOUND

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.513
AT UCLA AND UC BERKELEY THE

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.914
CAMPUSES LACKED CLEAR

00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:39.516
METHODOLOGIES FOR WHY THEY

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.717
WOULD DECIDE AMONGST A VERY

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.419
COMPETITIVE POOL OF APPLICANTS

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:43.887
TO CHOOSE ONE APPLICANT OVER

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:45.255
ANOTHER. LEAVING QUESTIONS

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:46.523
ABOUT WHY THEY WOULD CHOOSE THE

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.025
LOWER RATED APPLICANTS OVER

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.326
HIGHER RATED APPLICANTS WHICH

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:51.161
IS SOMETHING THAT WE SAW. AGAIN

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:52.863
WE RECOMMEND THE CAMPUSES ADOPT

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.731
CLEAR METHODOLOGIES FOR THE

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:55.999
CHOOSING AMONGST THEIR HIGHLY

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:57.467
COMPETITIVE POOLS BUT THE

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:58.969
UNIVERSITY IS STILL BEHIND IN

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:02.606
THAT AREA. WITH THAT I'LL TAKE

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:03.440

MCCARTY FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

TO THE ASSEMBLY. COLLEGE

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.375

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:40.811
EVERYONE I KNOW YOU HAVE TO

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:42.312
WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY'LL BE

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:43.213
ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE FOR

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.084
THEIR STUDENTS SOME HAVE TO-WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY MAKE

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.684
TOO MUCH MONEY TO QUALIFY FOR

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:49.486
FINANCIAL AID. STUDENTS WORRIED

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:51.188
ABOUT THEIR GPA FROM THE START

00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:52.689
OF THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:53.990
STANDARDIZED TESTING IS BOTH

00:49:54.057 --> 00:49:55.492
EXPENSIVE AND NOT ACTUALLY

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:56.860
REPRESENTATIVE OF EACH

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:58.195

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.065
ABOUT THE COST OF APPLICATIONS

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.233
WHAT OUR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.569
WILL LOOK LIKE. AND THE FEAR OF

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:07.270
REJECTION. AND FOR SOME THE

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:10.107
STORIES ARE MARGINAL. THEY KNOW

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:10.774
THAT THEY CAN AFFORD ALL OF

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.676
THESE THINGS. FOR SOME IT IS

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:14.578
EASY IS WRITING A CHECKS AND

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:15.579
OUT OF THE BOX THAT SHOULD

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:18.281
CONCERN EVERY PERSON ON THIS

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.783
COMMITTEE. EVERY STUDENT SHOULD

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.118
HAVE A FAIR CHANCE IN THE

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.919
ADMISSIONS PROCESS. WE SHOULD

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:24.054
NOT BE PRAYING TO GET LUCKY

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:25.722

IMPARTIALLY. THE PRESTIGE OF

00:50:29.826 --> 00:50:31.695
THE UC IS CONTINGENT UPON A

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:33.563
STRICTER FORM OF THIS PROCESS.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:34.531
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:36.466
ATTENDING OUR UNIVERSITY ARE

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.435
THOSE WHO TRULY WORKS FOR IT-

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:39.703
YOU KNOW AND HOW MUCH MONEY

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.938
YOUR FAMILY HAS. SHOULD NEVER

00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:42.672
BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN

00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:44.641
ADMISSIONS. BY CONTINUING TO

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.159
QUESTION THERE THERE'S A FEW

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:52.462
DIFFERENT- ELEMENTS- QUESTION I

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:54.564
WANNA MAKE SURE ADDRESS ONE IS.

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:55.865
THE ISSUE OF LETTERS OF

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:57.867
RECOMMENDATION. THE UNIVERSITY

00:58:57.934 --> 00:58:59.736
HAS FORMAL POLICIES ABOUT WHEN

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:01.337
LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION FOR

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:02.772
APPLICANTS ARE APPROPRIATE AND

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:04.374
NOT APPROPRIATE. SO THE

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.742
UNIVERSITY DOES HAVE A STAFF OF

00:59:05.808 --> 00:59:07.710
PRACTICES THAT DEFINE WHEN A

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:09.679
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION IS. IF

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:11.915
YOU WILL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF AN

00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:14.317
APPROPRIATE- ADMISSIONS

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:17.086
ASSESSMENT. AND WHEN IT IS NOT.

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:19.122
SO THERE'S PRETTY CLEAR

00:59:19.188 --> 00:59:20.223
INSTRUCTION ALREADY WITH

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.791
RESPECT TO WHAT TO DO WITH A

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:24.460
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION NOW.

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:25.061
WITH RESPECT TO THE WAIT LIST

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:27.463
ISSUE. WE DID SEE THAT SORT OF

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.731
ACTIVITY THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:32.368
DURING OUR UP AT- IT IS IT IS

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:33.770
GENERALLY OUTSIDE OF THE

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:36.172
PRESCRIBED. ALLOWABLE USE OF

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.374
LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION- SO

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:39.475
WE WOULD EXPECT THAT ADMISSIONS

00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:41.678
OFFICES DUE TO THE RELATIVELY

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:43.046
CALM IN NATURE OF THOSE.

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:44.881
CORRESPONDENTS WOULD HAVE. A

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:47.150
STANDARDIZED RESPONSES TO.

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:48.318
THOSE LETTERS AND OTHER WORDS

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:49.352
SAYING THAT THOSE ARE NOT

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:53.056
INFLUENTIAL AND DO NOT ARE NOT

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:54.023
CONSIDERED ON. AS PART OF THE

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.726
ADMISSIONS REVIEW PROCESS SO

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:58.461
WHAT DOES BE REPORTABLE EVENTS

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:02.098
UNDER- THE BILL'S PROVISIONS-

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:03.199
THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THE

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.500
UNIVERSITY PROBABLY HAS SOME

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:07.103
FLEXIBILITY ON IN TERMS OF-

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.705
DELINEATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.006
COMMUNICATIONS THAT STAFF MIGHT

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:12.208
RECEIVE IN THE WAYS IN WHICH

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.044
THEY SHOULD HANDLE. I SUCH A

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.246
BIT OF A GRAY AREA SO IT SAYS

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:20.083
THAT ALL. ALL THINGS SHOULD BE

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.217
REPORTED BUT THEY MAY HAVE A

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.119
PROCESS BY WHICH IT SAYS IF YOU

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:24.721
RECEIVE A LETTER FROM AN

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.523
APPLICANT- POST. DECISION BUT

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.092
PRE CLOSURE BECAUSE OF A

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:30.226
WEIGHTLESS SETTING EXPRESSES

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.961
THEIR INTEREST YOU'RE ALLOWED

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:34.397
TO SAY I GOT THIS LETTER- WHERE

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.499
IS THIS STUDENT OR BUSINESS

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.101
PERSON HAVE A PRAYER IT WAS IT

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.369
WAS AN IMPRESSIVE LETTER OR OR

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:41.871
NOT FOR THAT MATTER. THEY CAN

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.873
CREATE THEIR OWN POLICY AROUND.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.907
THE TICKET CREATE THEIR OWN

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:47.577
POLICY FOR HOW TO REPORT THAT

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:48.978
THE LETTER WAS RECEIVED A

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.080
COMMUNIQUE. BETWEEN THE

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.915
ADMISSIONS OFFICE AND OTHERS

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:56.486
ABOUT. WHERE IN THE RANKING A

01:00:56.552 --> 01:01:00.189
STUDENT MAY LIE. OUR TRICKY

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.224
BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHO THE

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.392
ADMISSIONS OFFICE IS SPEAKING

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.460
WITH THEY MAY BE SPEAKING WITH

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:06.462
THE DEPARTMENT ON CAMPUS THAT

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:09.265
HAS A ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.900
DECIDING WHICH STUDENTS ARE

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.102
ADMITTED SO CERTAIN MAJORS DO A

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.570
SUPPLEMENTAL REVIEW OF OTHER

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.172
APPLICANTS TO THEIR PROGRAMS

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:16.773
AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:18.741
PARTICIPANTS IN THE ADMISSIONS

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.576
PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:21.577
BETWEEN THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.279
AND ONE OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.881
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY FALL INTO

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:27.150
A DANGEROUS ZONE BUT THERE MAY

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.351
BE OTHER PEOPLE ON CAMPUS WHO

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.619
RECEIVE THOSE CORRESPONDENTS

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:30.620
FOR WHICH IT WOULD NOT BE

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:31.721
APPROPRIATE FOR THE ADMISSIONS

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:33.222
OFFICE TO BE IN CONVERSATIONS

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:34.323
WITH SURE AND I CAN IMAGINE

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.425
THAT BEING FROM THE DEVELOPMENT

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.026
OFFICE SENT SOMETHING THERE

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:40.129
THAT- IS NOT IN. IN KIND OF A-

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.297
SO THAT WE WOULD THINK OF AS A

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.166
MERITED- WAY OF EXPRESSING

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.301
INTEREST OR OR QUALITIES THAT

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.302
WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE. BEEN IN

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.171
THE PROGRAM- I HAVE A LOT OF

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:50.139
RESPECT FOR JUST THE ENTIRETY

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.374
OF THE WORK OF THE AUDITOR'S

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.708
OFFICE AN EXHAUSTIVE APPROACH

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:54.477
THAT YOU HAVE. ONE OF THE

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.113
QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE ABOUT-

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.648
HOW THE SUPPLIES IN THIS

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:03.753
INSTANCE. IS DID YOU USE- OTHER

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.856
UNIVERSITY MODELS FOR. DEALING

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:08.191
WITH THIS ISSUE DID YOU LOOK

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.626
OUTSIDE THE UC SYSTEM FOR WHAT

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:12.528
AND WHAT IN APPROACH SHOULD BE

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:13.896
FOR THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:15.565
WHETHER IT WOULD BE. A PUBLIC

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.233
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM LIKE YOU SEE

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.935
LIKE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OR

OR SUNY- OR EVEN PRIVATE SECTOR

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:23.539
UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE-

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:26.209
INSTANCES LIKE THIS WAY AND

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:29.112
THAT AS WELL. SO AS PART OF ANY

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:30.279
OUT OF IF YOU WERE GOING TO BE

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:31.414
LOOKING FOR BEST PRACTICES IN

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.182
THE FIELD THAT WE REVIEW. THERE

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.650
ARE NONE THAT WE SPECIFICALLY

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:36.452
REFER TO AN ARMADA AS THE

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:38.254
CRITERIA BY WHICH WE ASSESS THE

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:40.556
UC. WHAT WE WERE REFERRING TO

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:41.557
MOSTLY WHERE THE UC'S

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:43.426
PRINCIPLES AND ETHICS FOR IT

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.494
WHAT APPROPRIATE EMISSIONS

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.629
ACTIVITY WAS AND THEN A REVIEW

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.498
OF THE BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:49.932
ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.601
THOSE. PRINCIPLES AND ETHICS

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:54.904
ARE ADHERED TO AND THAT'S WHERE

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.005
WE SAW THE GAPS. AND IT'S WORTH

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:57.039
NOTING TO THE UNIVERSITY

01:02:57.106 --> 01:03:00.276
DOESN'T DISAGREE WITH THE- THE

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:01.043
PRINCIPLE OF THE

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.278
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MAKING IN

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.279
OTHER WORDS THAT CERTAIN

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:04.714
COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD JUST NOT

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.882

ON THE ON THE K. TWELVE THAT'S

03:01:16.031 --> 03:01:16.732

COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I AGREE WITH

03:01:18.701 --> 03:01:19.935
ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN

03:01:20.002 --> 03:01:21.971
SAID ABOUT THE VALUE. OF THE

03:01:22.037 --> 03:01:23.806
AND I THINK STUDIES IN THE ROLE

03:01:23.872 --> 03:01:25.207
IT PLAYS IN ALSO. THE

03:01:25.274 --> 03:01:27.509
BENEFICIAL ASPECTS THAT HAS FOR

03:01:27.576 --> 03:01:29.111
STUDENTS. I'VE TAKEN A NUMBER

OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND GENDER

STUDIES COURSES WHEN I WAS AT

COLLEGE AS WELL- IN IN. I

03:01:34.917 --> 03:01:37.086
REFLECT ON THAT AND- I EVEN AS

03:01:37.152 --> 03:01:38.420
I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT

03:01:38.487 --> 03:01:40.923
TOUCH ON ON THOSE TOPICS TODAY.

03:01:40.990 --> 03:01:43.993
YOU KNOW. PUBLIC DECADES LATER.

03:01:44.059 --> 03:01:46.328
AND AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

03:01:46.395 --> 03:01:47.930
KIND OF THE PATCHWORK APPROACH

03:01:47.997 --> 03:01:49.498
WE'VE BEEN TAKING WITH ETHNIC

03:01:49.565 --> 03:01:51.333
STUDIES WE HAVEN'T REALLY.

03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:53.636
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. FROM A

03:01:53.702 --> 03:01:56.805
HOLISTIC STANDPOINT ABOUT WHERE

03:01:56.872 --> 03:02:00.643
WE MAKE SURE. CALIFORNIANS

03:02:00.709 --> 03:02:03.379
REALLY UNDERSTAND CALIFORNIA

03:02:03.445 --> 03:02:06.348
AND OUR COUNTRY AND WE'RE WE

03:02:06.415 --> 03:02:08.017
DELIVER THAT EDUCATIONAL

03:02:08.083 --> 03:02:10.653
CONTENT AND WE'RE IT IS MOST

03:02:10.719 --> 03:02:12.588
APPROPRIATE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT

03:02:12.655 --> 03:02:14.456
AGAIN PATCHWORK PIECEMEAL HERE

03:02:14.523 --> 03:02:15.557
WE'RE GONNA TRY IT HERE AND

03:02:15.624 --> 03:02:18.494
THERE AND PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN

03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:19.361
ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT THEY CAN

03:02:19.428 --> 03:02:21.096
BE WORKED OUT TO TAKE TO

03:02:21.163 --> 03:02:23.532
REALLY- GET TO THAT THAT THAT

03:02:23.599 --> 03:02:24.867
THE ETHIC OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

03:02:24.933 --> 03:02:27.703
FOR FROM ETHNIC STUDIES. AND

03:02:27.770 --> 03:02:29.271
I'M NOT SURE OF THIS QUITE DOES

03:02:29.338 --> 03:02:32.474
IT FOR ME IN THIS INSTANCE ODD

03:02:32.541 --> 03:02:33.509
BECAUSE I THINK THAT EVERY

03:02:33.575 --> 03:02:35.244
STUDENT SHOULD HAVE I THINK YOU

03:02:35.311 --> 03:02:37.212
MADE THIS POINT IN YOUR OPENING

03:02:37.279 --> 03:02:39.915
PRESENTATION- AND IT'S A VERY

03:02:39.982 --> 03:02:43.552
GOOD POINT- THAT EVERYTHING

03:02:43.619 --> 03:02:44.720
SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO

03:02:44.787 --> 03:02:47.122
TAKE THIS COURSE A COURSE THAT

03:02:47.189 --> 03:02:49.992
FEELS THE THIS GOAL AND- AND I

03:02:50.059 --> 03:02:51.860
AGREE WITH YOU A 100% AND I

03:02:51.927 --> 03:02:53.462
THINK THAT YOU KNOW I ATTENDED

03:02:53.529 --> 03:02:55.698
PIERCE COLLEGE ONE SUMMER- YOU

03:02:55.764 --> 03:02:57.499
KNOW- IN AND TOOK A COURSE IN

03:02:57.566 --> 03:02:58.767
ITS FINAL WATER RESPECTFULLY

03:02:58.834 --> 03:03:01.670
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THEY SHOULD

03:03:01.737 --> 03:03:03.772
ABSOLUTELY- PROVIDE THIS

03:03:03.839 --> 03:03:05.374
COURSEWORK FOR STUDENTS THAT

03:03:05.441 --> 03:03:09.044
WANT TO TAKE IT. BUT I CAN SEE.

03:03:09.111 --> 03:03:11.180
AS WELL YOU KNOW I WENT TO CAL

03:03:11.246 --> 03:03:13.282
STATE NORTHRIDGE- THE FIRST.

03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:14.616
CHICANO STUDIES PROGRAM IN THE

03:03:14.683 --> 03:03:18.387
NATION- WORLD RENOWNED IN ITS

03:03:18.454 --> 03:03:20.322
ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMMING. BUT

03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:22.858
I COULD SEE WANTING TO GET TO

03:03:22.925 --> 03:03:25.361
NORTHRIDGE TO REALLY TAKE A

03:03:25.427 --> 03:03:27.963
DEEP DIVE INTELLECTUALLY. ON MY

03:03:28.030 --> 03:03:30.265
ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE COURSE

03:03:30.332 --> 03:03:32.868
WORK AND THIS COULD BE FOR ANY

03:03:32.935 --> 03:03:35.604
ANY INSTITUTION. AND SO I COULD

03:03:35.671 --> 03:03:38.140
SEE A REASON NOT TO KNOCK OUT

03:03:38.207 --> 03:03:40.275
SOMETHING IN THE COMMUNITY

03:03:40.342 --> 03:03:41.710
COLLEGE IF I DON'T WANT TO.

03:03:41.777 --> 03:03:43.178
BECAUSE I DECIDED TO DO IT

03:03:43.245 --> 03:03:48.083
LATER IN IN THE CSU- OR TO TAKE

03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:49.385
IT IF IT IS MY CHOICE AT THE

03:03:49.451 --> 03:03:51.120
COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT AGAIN NOT

03:03:51.186 --> 03:03:53.255
THAT WOULD BE MORE ON A CHOICE

03:03:53.322 --> 03:03:54.256
ISSUE AND THEN I'VE GOT.

03:03:54.323 --> 03:04:00.062
BROADER. INSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS

03:04:00.129 --> 03:04:02.965
ABOUT- THE PURGATORY THAT IS

03:04:03.031 --> 03:04:04.333
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR SO MANY

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:05.868
STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS THAT

03:04:05.934 --> 03:04:07.903
WANT TO GET IN THERE TO

03:04:07.970 --> 03:04:10.005
ACCOMPLISH A GOAL TO FURTHER

A- A POST SECONDARY DEGREE- AND%

03:04:21.183 --> 03:04:22.684
THAT WE ARE MAKING IT EVEN MORE

03:04:22.751 --> 03:04:24.453
STIFLING MORE DIFFICULT MORE OF

03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:26.989
A STRUGGLE MORE OF A DELAY MORE

03:04:27.055 --> 03:04:36.432
OF A WAIT- A MORE OF A- FIVE A

03:04:36.498 --> 03:04:38.467
BLOCK TO GETTING THEM WHERE

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:41.103
WHERE THEY WANT TO GO AND SO- I

03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:42.337
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA VOTE NO ON

WHETHER IT'S K. TWELVE FOR HIRE

03:05:04.726 --> 03:05:06.395
READ TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

03:05:06.462 --> 03:05:09.231
AN ETHNIC STUDIES- COMPONENT IN

03:05:09.298 --> 03:05:10.799
A STUDENT'S EDUCATION. AT

THAT WERE JUST MADE BY OUR

03:05:25.247 --> 03:05:27.683
COLLEAGUE FROM MORAN- BUT I

03:05:27.749 --> 03:05:31.587
SHARE- BOTH HIS ASSESSMENT OF

03:05:31.653 --> 03:05:32.588
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS

03:05:32.654 --> 03:05:34.356
CURRICULUM AND IT WAS A CO

03:05:34.423 --> 03:05:37.392
AUTHOR OF OUR CHAIRS BILL- OVER

03:05:37.459 --> 03:05:39.895
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS- SO I

03:05:39.962 --> 03:05:42.331
BELIEVE IN THAT- BUT I ON ALSO

03:05:42.397 --> 03:05:44.600
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW IT FITS

03:05:44.666 --> 03:05:47.836
INTO THE OVERALL- CURRICULUM-

03:05:47.903 --> 03:05:51.073
IN A TWO YEAR PROGRAM- WHERE

03:05:51.139 --> 03:05:53.475
IT'S REALLY FAST PACED AND-

03:05:53.542 --> 03:05:54.676
STUDENTS ARE FREQUENTLY VERY

03:05:54.743 --> 03:05:57.479
GOAL ORIENTED- AND HAVE TO MAKE

03:05:57.546 --> 03:05:59.982
CHOICES ABOUT COURSES. AND OF

03:06:00.048 --> 03:06:03.352
MAY CHOOSE TO PRIORITIZE- OTHER

03:06:03.418 --> 03:06:05.754
THINGS AND SO WHEN WE REQUIRE

03:06:05.821 --> 03:06:07.723
OF COURSE IT I THINK THERE'S A

03:06:07.789 --> 03:06:09.124
LITTLE BIT OF A BUTTERFLY

03:06:09.191 --> 03:06:12.094
