AND WE WERE COMMONLY WITH OUR

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:48.612
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE SO I

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.781
HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.316
PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL DUMPING.

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:55.186
ABOUT A YEAR AGO OF ONE OF THE

00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:56.387
WE STARTED TO FORM OF WORKING

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:57.721

WE HAD PUBLIC WORKS AT THE TABLE --

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:05.863
CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICES

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.766
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MY OFFICE

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:11.602
AND OUR INSPECTORS START TO DO

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:13.604
SOME INVESTIGATIONS ON CAMERAS

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:15.573
CAMERA HITS EVIDENTIARY LEADS

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.541
FROM LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND WE

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:22.046
LEARNED SOME THINGS -- BUT ONE

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:23.647
OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED IS THAT

00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:25.216
IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DUMPING

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:26.717
COMMUNITY AND IT'S OFTEN FALLS

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.619
ON THE SHOULDERS OF A PUBLIC

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:30.521
WORKS IS THAT THE BIG PROBLEM.

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:32.089
IS THIS.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:33.624
WHEN PEOPLE?

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:36.126
JUMP AND PUBLIC WORKS PICKS IT

00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:37.795
UP THEY JUST KEEP DUMPING.

00:41:37.862 --> 00:41:39.597
AND THAT THEY TALK ABOUT THE

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:40.831
THREE EASE AND THE ILLEGAL

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:42.600
DUMPING COMMUNITY THAT'S A

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.934
RATIFICATION.

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:46.704
EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.372
THERE'S PLENTY OF A RATIFICATION

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:49.773
WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR IT.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.408
THERE'S PLENTY OF EDUCATION WE

00:41:51.475 --> 00:41:53.143
ALL SEE THE YOU KNOW.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.745
MESSAGING OUT THERE.

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:56.113
BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.114
ENFORCEMENT.

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:59.316
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

00:41:59.383 --> 00:42:01.552
OUR FOCUS ON VIOLENT CRIMES

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:04.088
SERIOUS CRIMES AND ILLEGAL

00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:05.089
DUMPING CASES.

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:07.458
ARE SUPER EASY TO INVESTIGATE

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:08.859
YOU START OFF TYPICALLY WITH A

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:11.028
CAMERA LEAD IN THE LICENSE PLATE

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.830
THE PERSON DRIVING THE CAR MAY

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.198
NOT BE.

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:16.667
OFTEN IS NOT THE PERSON.

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:17.501
THAT THE RIGHT IS THE REGISTERED

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:18.202
OWNER.

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:20.004
SO ENFORCEMENT IS SERIOUSLY

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.173
LACKING SO WE'VE DEVELOPED.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.608
AN INCIPIENT COMMUNITY REALLY

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:28.579
AND TALK TO OUR COLLEAGUES AND

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.648
WHAT WE ARE HOPING IS THAT THIS

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:33.350
PILOT PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP SOME

00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:35.219
EXPERTISE HELP US DEVELOP THIS

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.320
COMMUNITY.

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:38.923
AND HELP US DEVELOP SOME CASES

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:41.592
THAT WE CAN PUBLICIZE SO THAT

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:44.295
THE PUBLIC DOESN'T THINK NOTHING

00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:47.798
IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- AND IT IS

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.401
OUR HOPE THAT BASED ON THAT BET.

00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:52.136
WE CAN RETURN TO COMMUNITIES

00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:53.737
LIKE THIS ONE IN EAST OAKLAND

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:55.272
WHERE WE MET WITH.

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:56.440
DURING SCHOOL HOURS WE MET WITH

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:58.609
KIDS WITH SIGNS WE MET WITH

00:42:58.676 --> 00:42:59.710
LITERALLY CRYING MOTHERS WHO ARE

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:01.645
SAYING DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:03.414
SEEMS LIKE NOBODY CARES.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:03.914
AND WE D. A.'S ARE VERY

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.115
FRUSTRATED.

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:06.283
BECAUSE THE LACK OF

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.718
INVESTIGATIONS IS NOT BRINGING

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:09.153
US CASES AND WE WANT TO SHOW

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:10.654
THAT IF WE INVESTIGATE SOME

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:11.655
CASES I MEAN FOR SOME SORT TO

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:13.524
SOME DETERRENCE HERE.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.792
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.160
DIFFERENCE.

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.461
WHEN YOU HAVE A CITIZEN WILLING

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:18.562
TO STICK THEIR NECK OUT AND

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.197
VIDEOTAPE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.832
DUMPING AND YOU LEARNED THAT

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:24.034
NOTHING HAPPENED WHEN THEY WERE

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:26.470
WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK --

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:27.972
IT'S AS I SAID VERY FRUSTRATING

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.473
SO WE'RE HOPING TO LEARN SOME

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.008
LESSONS HERE -- OUR

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:32.076
INVESTIGATORS WHEN THEY WORKED

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:35.245
UP THESE CASES HAVE INTERVIEWED --

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:36.380
SUSPECTS.

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:37.748
WHY DID YOU DUMP WHAT WOULD

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:39.183
CHANGE YOUR MIND WHAT KIND OF

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:42.619
MESSAGING MIGHT AFFECT YOU -- SO.

00:43:42.686 --> 00:43:43.887
IN BRIEF THAT'S WEBER SUPPORTING

00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.956
THIS THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:48.225
OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:50.027
ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:50.594
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:53.897
MEMBERS.

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:55.165
MR QUIRK AT THE WHICH FIRST AND

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:57.735
THEN MISTER ACT OKAY -- SO IT IS

00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.236
VERY HARD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:01.138
THIS HAYWARD THE CITY I WAS ON

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:03.007
THE COUNCIL OF SPENDS MILLION

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:05.676
SPENT. TEN YEARS AGO MILLION

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:07.044
DOLLARS YEAR ON THIS IT'S

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:09.380
PROBABLY MORE NOW -- MY ONLY

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:11.382
CONCERN ABOUT THIS IS THAT I'M

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:12.182
NOT SURE IT'LL GET THROUGH

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:14.551
APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE THE STATE

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:15.953
IS I READ THIS.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.422
IS FUNDING THE POSITION.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:19.923
AND IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.725
YOU COULD JUST HAND AROUND THE

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:23.761
CUP TO THE CITIES IN THE COUNTY

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.095
AND HAVE THEM.

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:26.864
PUT THE MONEY FORWARD MY MY

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.699
CONCERN IS IN APPROPRIATIONS TOP

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:31.135
EASILY GREAT POLICY IT'S HARD TO

00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:33.170
GET GOOD POLICIES IN THIS.

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:35.973
I'VE TRIED -- SO THAT'S MY ONLY

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.742
SUGGESTION THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:39.743
THANK YOU BYE AND EDIT VOTE

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.278
MISTER LACKEY YEAH MY COMMENT

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.813
WAS SIMILAR I DON'T I DIDN'T

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.081
EVEN SEE AN APPROPRIATION IN

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.049
THIS BILL.

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:47.818
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- LOCAL

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:49.753
GOVERNMENT HAS A HUGE

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.754
RESPONSIBILITY I COULD TAKE IT.

00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:52.122
TO IT'S AN IMMENSE PROBLEM WHERE

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:53.724
I LIVE -- BECAUSE WE LIVE IN

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:54.992
DESERT AREA.

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.226
AND WE HAVE SOME PROFESSIONAL

00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:57.327
NUMBERS.

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:59.696
IT REALLY IS THAT BIG OF A DEAL

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:01.832
I MEAN WE HAVE -- A REAL PROBLEM

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:04.268
WITH MEDICAL SUPPLIES BEING

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:06.136
DUMPED IN THE DESERT --

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:07.938
CONSTRUCTION OBVIOUSLY

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.274
PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE JUST DUMPING

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.608
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE SO THIS

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.177
IS A VERY SERIOUS STATEWIDE

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:14.711
PROBLEM HOWEVER.

00:45:14.778 --> 00:45:16.780
I IT I AM A BIG BELIEVER THAT

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:18.248
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.117
UNDERSTANDS THE COMPLEXITY AND

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:21.452
THE UNIQUE NATURE IN EACH

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:23.587
SPECIFIC AREA AND I WORRY THAT

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:24.822
WE'RE OPENING.

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.623
A DOOR THAT WE REALLY.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.125
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT SERVES THE

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:30.494
STATE WIDE INTEREST.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.162
IN THE RELYING ON THE STATE TO

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:33.797
TO REMEDY THIS OF THAT THAT'S MY

AS HE HAD ASSAULTED ME IN THE

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:06.156
PAST AND THAT WE NEEDED TO BE

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:07.090
CAREFUL.

DISCHARGED PATIENTS THAT DID NOT

INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TAKEN TO

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:00.677
PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOMS

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:02.645
BECAUSE THEY ARE PSYCHOTIC OR

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:04.080
DANGER TO SELF OR OTHERS.

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.782
ARE NOT GOING TO BE DETERRED BY

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:09.752
READING A NOTICE ON THE WALL --

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:13.289
THE SAME WITH GERIATRIC PATIENTS --

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:15.725
SO YOU KNOW OUR BASIC PHILOSOPHY

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:18.094
IS MASS INCARCERATION IS NOT THE

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.696
ANSWER TO EVERY PROBLEM.

00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:21.831
IN RESEARCHING THE OPPOSITION TO

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:24.934
THIS BILL -- I FOUND THAT THE

00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:26.269
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.004
HOSPITALS AND ACTUALLY COME UP

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:30.373
WITH THE BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.041
TRAINING PROGRAM.

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:34.878
WHICH IT DOES REDUCE VIOLENCE

00:58:34.944 --> 00:58:37.313
AGAINST MEDICAL STAFF.

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.748
AND IT STARTS WITH A

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:40.817
COMMUNICATION TRAINING TO DEAL

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:41.885
WITH VERBAL CONFLICTS WITH

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:44.787
PATIENTS. TO LEARN HOW TO ESCAPE

00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:46.122
A PATIENT'S GROW UP WITHOUT

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.891
HURTING THE PATIENT OR BEING

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.192
HURT YOURSELF.

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.960
AND TO LEARN HOW TO WORK IN A

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:54.297
TEAM TO SAFELY CONTAIN A PATIENT.

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:56.232
SO WE BELIEVE THAT'S A BETTER

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:59.068
SOLUTION. TO THIS PROBLEM AND WE

00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:01.571
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:01.771

FOR THIS BILL ALTHOUGH I DON'T

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:22.719
THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION --

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.153
BUT I DO THINK IT'S A BIG

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.355
PROBLEM AND I HOPE YOU'LL THINK

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.522
ABOUT OTHER SOLUTIONS GOING

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.158

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.560
BIG PROBLEM I WILL VOTE FOR THE

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:33.062
BILL BUT I THINK.

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:34.564
WHAT'S THE FRACTION OF PEOPLE IN

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.932

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.433
DERANGED IS IT HALF.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.402
AND THE BEHAVIOR I HEARD FROM

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.503
THESE FOLKS.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.138
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S MENTALLY

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:45.775
DERANGED I I DOUBT THAT A SIGN

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.343
IS GOING TO MATTER.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.312
AND THAT IF SIX MONTHS IN JAIL

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:50.947
ISN'T ENOUGH THAT A YEAR WILL

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.181
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:53.483
BUT I DO THINK THIS IS A VERY

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:54.851
IMPORTANT PROBLEM AND I HOPE

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:55.818
YOU'LL THINK ABOUT OF THE

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.453

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.621
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK THIS

01:00:58.688 --> 01:00:59.822
IS GOING TO WORK.

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:03.626

BUT WHAT I FIND TO BE.

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:52.067
PERPLEXING IS THE FACT THAT

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:54.437
YOU'RE BASICALLY HIJACKING THE

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:56.005

THEY WOULD LOSE THAT MONEY.

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.400

01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:24.967

WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL EITHER

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS THAT

01:26:50.071 --> 01:26:51.339

CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. TO ADD

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:54.375
SUCH A CLASS WOULD WEAKEN THE

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:01.783

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:02.784
EVEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:19.033
AS A MORE SENSIBLE ALTERNATIVE I

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.902
ASK LAWMAKERS TO CONSIDER ADDING

YEAH.

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:37.779
WE AGREED THAT HOMELESS

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:38.980
INDIVIDUALS ARE IN NEED OF

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.948
HEIGHTENED PROTECTIONS IN THE

LAW THEY ARE QUITE VULNERABLE TO

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:43.217
CRIMES OF ALL SORTS.

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:46.287
THE HATE CRIME STATUTE --

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:48.556
DESPITE ITS NAME -- WAS WAS

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:49.957
CONCEIVED OF AND HAS BEEN THE

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:50.491
REASON WHY IT'S STILL HAS

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:53.094
INTEGRITY AND IT HAS BEEN ABLE

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:53.428
TO WITHSTAND.

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:55.029
A CONTINUED SPEECHES AND

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:56.597
POLITICAL ATTACKS ON THE NEED

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:57.632
FOR HATE CRIME LAW IS BECAUSE OF

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.634
THE INTEGRITY IT IS MEANT.

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:01.169
TO COVER THOSE CHARACTERISTICS

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:03.571
WHICH AGAIN OUR CORE AN

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:04.939
INTRINSIC TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.607
EITHER CANNOT OR SHOULD NOT HAVE

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:09.210
TO CHANGE IT -- THE CURRENT

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:11.245
CATEGORIES ALL FALL IN THAT THE

01:29:11.312 --> 01:29:13.247
CURRENT SIX CATEGORIES IN

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:14.482
CALIFORNIA'S LAW.

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:17.151
DESPITE THE VULNERABILITY -- TO

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:19.620
CRIMES OF ALL SORTS THAT ARE

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.556
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS I HAVE AND

01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:22.957
WHICH IS CITED MULTIPLE TIMES AS

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:24.225
THE REASON.

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:26.160
FOR THIS THIS BILL -- BY THE

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:27.395
AUTHOR THE VULNERABLE VICTIM

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:30.431
STATUTE -- WE FEEL IT IS MORE

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:32.834
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.702
ANALOGOUS -- TO EIGHTY TWO WHICH

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:35.803
WAS ANOTHER BILL THAT.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.438
WE OPPOSE ALSO THAT WOULD HAVE

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:38.740
ADDED PEACE OFFICERS TO THE HATE

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:40.108
CRIME STATUTE THERE ARE THOSE

01:29:40.174 --> 01:29:42.310
WHO TARGET PEACE PEACE OFFICERS

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.578
FOR VIOLENCE.

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:45.279
AND WE RIGHTLY CONDEMNED THAT

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:46.781
BUT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE TO PUT

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:48.916
A PROFESSION I INTO EVEN EVEN

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.585
THAT TYPE OF PROFESSION INTO THE

01:29:50.651 --> 01:29:52.353
HATE CRIMES STATUTE THERE ARE

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:53.721
OTHER STATUTES WHERE IT IS MORE

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:56.090
APPROPRIATE AND WE PUT TO YOU IS

01:29:56.157 --> 01:30:02.964
THE SAME THING HERE.

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:04.198
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.967

MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:08.569
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE

01:30:08.636 --> 01:30:09.504
OPPOSE THIS BILL BUT I REALLY

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.105
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS I

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.406
HAD WITH THE MEMBER STAFF ABOUT

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:12.874
THE BILL.

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:15.743
AND THE INTENTIONS BEHIND IT --

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.445
CERTAINLY -- AS PUBLIC DEFENDERS

01:30:17.512 --> 01:30:19.046
WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:21.516
PLIGHT OF THE HOMELESS MANY OF

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:23.184
THEM ARE THEIR CLIENTS.

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:25.553
ON ALSO MY FATHER WAS HOMELESS

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.222
AS A TEENAGER AND THROUGHOUT

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:29.891
MUCH OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION.

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:33.227
AND ALTHOUGH PEOPLE WERE NOT

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:35.930
REVILED AT THAT TIME BECAUSE SO

01:30:35.997 --> 01:30:37.365
MANY PEOPLE WERE HOMELESS.

01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:40.101
WE BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.202
THIS RESOURCES.

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:43.237
THAT WOULD TAKE TO INCARCERATE

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:45.006
MORE PEOPLE UNDER THIS BILL

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:47.441
WOULD BE BETTER SPENT TO PROVIDE

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:49.977
SERVICES. FOR HOUSING MENTAL

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:51.345
HEALTH TREATMENT DRUG AND

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:52.647
EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:55.249
HOMELESS INSTEAD OF LONGER

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:56.417
PRISON SENTENCES.

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:58.219
JUST THIS MORNING MANY OF YOU

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:00.188
MAY HAVE HEARD THE STORY ON THE

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:03.391
CALIFORNIA REPORT ABOUT THE PARK

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:06.093
RANGERS AND SACRAMENTO TICKETING

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.095
THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS.

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:11.532
ALONG THE RIVER.

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:12.800
THIS IS THE SITUATION.

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:15.403
THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGE THAT.

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:16.938
I AGREE WITH KEEPING THE

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:20.474
INTEGRITY OF THE HATE STE --

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.009
STATUTES THAT EXIST I DON'T

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:23.444
BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.313
ON PUT THIS AND SOME OTHER

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:27.982
STATUTE SO THANK YOU AND THAT WE

01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:29.217
ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE.

01:31:29.283 --> 01:31:31.953
THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:33.087
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.222
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.790
MEMBERS.

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:39.594
YES MITCHELL LACKEY.

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.195
YES CERTAINLY I'M.

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.897
I'M ALWAYS AN ADVOCATE. FOR

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:46.033
VICTIMS OF A CRIMINALITY.

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.768
AND I THINK THE DISTRICT

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:51.439
ATTORNEY -- EXPRESSED IT

01:31:51.505 --> 01:31:53.207
PROBABLY IT PROBABLY THE BEST.

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:55.309
BY INDICATING THAT THERE IS

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.811
ANOTHER PATH THAT WE CAN

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:59.313
RECOGNIZE THIS THIS UNISEX.

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.181
AGAINST THESE VERY VULNERABLE

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:01.983
PEOPLE THEY ARE.

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:03.484
UNIQUELY VULNERABLE.

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:05.786
AND I THINK AT IN THEM TO THE

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:06.420
SIX SIX SEVEN POINT NINE OF THE

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:09.190
PENAL CODE.

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:10.258
IS THE BETTER PATHWAY BECAUSE

01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:11.359
ABILITY IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF

01:32:11.425 --> 01:32:13.628
HATE CRIME.

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:15.463
AND I KNOW YOU USED THE THE

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:16.397
EXAMPLE OF RELIGION [inaudible]

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:20.234
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:32:20.301 --> 01:32:21.435
RELIGION AND HOMELESSNESS THIS

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:23.671
IS NOT A GOAL. TO MOVE SOMEBODY

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:25.673
FROM RELIGIOUS TO NON RELIGIOUS

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.408
IT IS OUR GOAL TO REMOVE

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.677
SOMEBODY FROM HOMELESSNESS. TO

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:31.245
NON HOMELESSNESS AND THAT IS AN

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:32.914
IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENT THAT I

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.716
THINK IS VERY POWERFUL SO FOR

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.485
THAT REASON.

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:40.454
I I NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:42.156
PATHWAY AT THIS TIME

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:42.456
[inaudible]

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:45.793
ANYONE ELSE.

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:46.928
KAMLAGER-DOVE.

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:47.995
YEAH I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.897
FOR BRINGING -- THIS BILL TO THE

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:55.469
COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION I WOMEN

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:56.437
GENERALLY I'M NOT ON THE SAME

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:58.239
SIDE AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:02.443
SO -- IN MY EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY --

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:04.078
BEING ABLE TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:07.114
FOR HATE CRIME IS VERY DIFFICULT

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:08.683
TO DO THE THRESHOLD.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.151
AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS SO

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:12.053
HIGH AND WHEN FOLKS ARE

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:14.288
COMMITTING SUCH HEINOUS CRIMES

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:16.090
AS I'M SORRY ATTACKING OR

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:17.858
KILLING SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:18.726
POOR.

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:19.694
ESSENTIALLY ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.963
HOMELESS THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:23.331
TOOLS AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:25.232
PENAL CODE WHERE YOU CAN GO

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:27.735
AFTER THEM I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:29.904
ACTUALLY WANT TO MOVE SOMEONE

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:32.073
INTO A GROUP WHERE IT THEN

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:33.607
BECOMES INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:34.976
PROSECUTE IN CHARGE.

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:36.777
AND HOLD PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:39.580
THESE ACTS -- WE'VE JUST SEEN IN

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:42.850
THE NEWS LET ALONE THE DATA.

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:43.751
THAT -- THAT JUST TALKS ABOUT

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:45.386
HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO DO THAT

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.387
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:48.422
RESPONSE TO SOME OF THAT BECAUSE

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:51.425
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THE DATA --

01:33:51.492 --> 01:33:54.228
MY WITNESSES IN MY WINTERS CAN

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.397
COME BACK UP OF SOMEONE TO MOVE

01:33:56.464 --> 01:34:01.302
FROM HERE SO MODES SURE.

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:01.936

MAY I DRESS SOME OF THE FIRST OF

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:20.921
ALL YOU WOULD GIVE YOU.

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:21.822
AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:23.624
READ BY MY LOOK AT US FROM

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:25.893
STANFORD JOHN HART ELY ROAD A

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.996
FOOTNOTE FOR CAROLINE AND ALSO

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:29.630
ABOUT THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.565
THESE WERE LEFT EXPANSIVE FOR A

01:34:31.632 --> 01:34:34.035
REASON AND THE ISSUE HERE.

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:34.635
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL HERE

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:37.438
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:38.005
SIXTY FOUR WHEN THE NEW YORK

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:38.639
TIMES WRITING ABOUT IT SAID IT

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:40.074
WAS NOT ONLY SOMETHING.

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:42.977
THAT WAS GOING TO BE AN

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:45.880
ENFORCEABLE.

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:48.449
METRIC BUT ALSO WAS A MORAL

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:49.050
METRIC.

01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:51.886
AND WHEN WE HAVE PREJUDICE WE

01:34:51.952 --> 01:34:54.188
HAVE THE SAME TYPES OF OFFENDERS

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:54.822
FOR REAL OFFENDERS WHO DO IT FOR

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:55.122
EXCITEMENT.

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:58.025
DEFENSIVE REACTIVE OFFENDERS

01:34:58.092 --> 01:34:58.793
WERE PROTECTING TURF TO THEIR

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.227
NEIGHBORHOOD AND NEO ****

01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:01.996

SO IF WE'RE GOING TO SAY IT

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.535
MIGHT NOT BE AS EFFICIENT AS

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:08.402
PEOPLE LIKE THAT I THINK WE HAVE

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:09.837
TO LOOK AT THE FACT.

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:12.807
THAT WE HAVE A VARIETY OF GROUPS

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:14.408
WERE COVERED AND MANY EDL FIRST

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:14.942
CAME OUT WITH THEIR MODEL

01:35:15.009 --> 01:35:16.977
LEGISLATION BACK IN.

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:17.578
NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IT DIDN'T

01:35:18.813 --> 01:35:20.347
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN GRASSROOTS

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:21.982
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.084
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS WHEN

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:24.518
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TYPES OF

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:26.487
HOMICIDE WE'RE SEEING.

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:27.721
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE THAT

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:30.057
ARE MOTIVATED BY NEGATIVE

01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:32.293
STEREOTYPES BASED ON PREJUDICE

01:35:32.359 --> 01:35:34.161
NO ONE HAS COME UP WITH A NEW

01:35:34.228 --> 01:35:36.397
CONVOLUTED THING.

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:37.665
WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL I

01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:38.532

THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:53.147
BOTTOM LINE IS DO WE HAVE A

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:55.950
PROBLEM TARGET VIOLENCE IS IT

01:35:56.016 --> 01:35:57.184
AGAINST THE COMMUNITY THAT IS

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:59.353

FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT PREVIOUS

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:01.589
AND WE SEE THAT WITH A LOT OF

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:01.889
HATE CRIME.

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:03.491
AND IS IT MOTIVATED BY PREJUDICE

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:05.092

HOMELESS PEOPLE BEING FILLED.

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.142
THAT IS THE PREJUDICE THAT IS

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.543
DRIVING THIS IT'S NOT THE

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:23.477
VULNERABILITY WE DON'T HAVE

OF CAMPERS.

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:25.913
WE HAD PEOPLE BEATING THE

DISGUSTING.

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:52.900

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:16.517
WAY IN THIS SPACE [inaudible]

BE PROTECTED.

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:27.054
THE DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW IS

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:28.155
WHETHER NOT THEY GO INTO JUST.

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:30.057
ONE CATEGORY.

BOB VEHICLE TO MOVE IT INTO

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:37.364
[inaudible]

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:41.402
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE IN A

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:44.304
PORTION STEP A MERCEDES.

01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:45.506
THEY'VE GIVEN YOU A VEHICLE IN

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:47.474
WHICH YOU CAN MOVE THIS ALONG

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:48.575
AND PROVIDE.

01:40:48.642 --> 01:40:51.278
PROTECTIONS TO THIS GROUP THAT

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:53.480
WE CAN THEN MOVE FORWARD AND

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:54.882
HOPEFULLY WHAT LOCAL LAW

01:40:54.948 --> 01:40:56.450
ENFORCEMENT THE TO MOVE WILL.

01:40:56.517 --> 01:40:58.986
FOR I WAS HERE WHEN WE HAD THIS

01:40:59.052 --> 01:40:59.753
DISCUSSION.

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.155
ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:03.290
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:04.158
WERE TARGETED I THINK AT THAT

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:06.026
TIME WE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:07.795
INCIDENT OF FIVE OFFICERS

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:09.930
GETTING KILLED IN DALLAS.

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:13.000
THAT WERE TARGETED -- IN ONE OF

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:14.835
THE MOST COWARDLY HEINOUS THINGS

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:16.804
YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS VERY

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.672
DIFFICULT FOR THIS COMMITTEE.

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:20.841
BECAUSE OF IT BEING A HATE CRIME

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:21.809
QUEST TO SAY NOT WITH VERY

01:41:21.875 --> 01:41:24.545
DIFFICULT. FOR US TO SAY SAY NO

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:30.017
BECAUSE THERE.

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:32.085
THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF AS WHEN

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:33.654
YOU'RE WITNESSES SAID.

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.655
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HOMELESS

01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:36.790
PERSON.

01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:38.692
IT IS A HATE CRIME.

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.394
BECAUSE HE'S AFRICAN AMERICAN.

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:42.095
AND HE CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.730
AND SO THAT'S THE WHOLE CONCEPT

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:47.167
IF WE START GOING DOWN THE ROAD.

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:58.531
INTELLIGENCE THAT DEEP BREAKS

01:48:58.598 --> 01:49:00.267
ARE BASED ON WAS FIRST DEVELOPED

01:49:00.333 --> 01:49:01.835
IN.

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:02.335
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIS

01:49:02.402 --> 01:49:03.503
SPECIFIC APPLICATION FIRST

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.906
APPEARED IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY

01:49:05.972 --> 01:49:07.507
SEVENTEEN ON A REDDIT FORM.

01:49:07.574 --> 01:49:10.677
AND HAS SINCE EXPLODED IN USE.

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:12.345
A NUMBER OF HIGH PROFILE DEEP

IN THE CASE OF SCHOLARSHIP

01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:22.956
JOHANNSON THE VIDEO WAS

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:24.925
PORTRAYED AS AN AUTHENTIC LEAKED

01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:26.626
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT VIDEO.

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:30.230
THAT WAS VIEWED OVER ONE POINT

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:31.197
FIVE MILLION TIMES.

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:32.732
IN MOST INSTANCES A TARGET IS

01:49:32.799 --> 01:49:34.834
IDENTIFIED ANY FACIAL PROFILE IS

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:36.937
HARVESTED FROM EXISTING VIDEO

01:49:37.003 --> 01:49:38.171
LIKE MOVIES OR POLITICAL

01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:39.673
ADVERTISEMENTS.

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:42.242
THE FOOTAGE IS THEN ANALYZED BY

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:43.510
THE DEEP MAKE APPLICATION.

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:44.911
AFTER THE TARGETS FACES BEEN

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:46.546
SUFFICIENTLY ANALYZED THE

01:49:46.613 --> 01:49:48.448
APPLICATION THEN ANALYZES THE

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:50.717
SOURCE VIDEO TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:52.452
TO GRAPH THE TARGET SPACE ON TO

01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:53.787
THE ORIGINAL VIDEO.

01:49:53.853 --> 01:49:55.755
THE RESULTS ARE ASTOUNDING AND

01:49:55.822 --> 01:49:57.290
INCLUDE FULL REPRESENTATION OF

01:49:59.592 --> 01:50:00.961
EVEN SPEECH.

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:02.495
AS THE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES LESS

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:04.297
SOURCE MATERIAL WILL BE REQUIRED

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:06.333
AND NOW BUT QUALITY WILL ALSO

01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:07.434
IMPROVE.

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:08.868
AS SUCH THE BILL BEFORE YOU

01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:11.604
TODAY FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON THE

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:14.240
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF

01:50:14.307 --> 01:50:15.842
MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP FAKE

01:50:15.909 --> 01:50:16.843
VIDEOS.

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:18.311
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:19.713
RECOGNIZING THE DANGER OF SEVERE

01:50:19.779 --> 01:50:22.115
MENTAL ANGUISH AND REPUTATIONAL

01:50:22.182 --> 01:50:23.416
HARM THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY

01:50:23.483 --> 01:50:25.552
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:26.920
RELEASED ON THE INTERNET WITHOUT

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:28.054
CONSENT.

01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:29.789
THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY

01:50:29.856 --> 01:50:32.125
PASSED A PROHIBITION ON SO

01:50:32.192 --> 01:50:33.626
CALLED REVENGE PORN.

01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:35.295
AS AN ANALOG TO THE COMMENDABLE

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:37.530
LEGISLATION THIS BILL RESPONSE

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:39.299
TO A NEW WAY THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:40.834
BE HARNESSED TO INFLICT

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:43.370
EMOTIONAL HARM OR DAMAGE ON A

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:44.537
PERSON'S REPUTATION.

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:47.040
NO LONGER DOES SOMEBODY HAVE TO

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:49.009
ACTUALLY -- ACTUALLY BE FILMED

01:50:49.075 --> 01:50:51.745
IN A SEXUAL ACT NOW THERE ONLY

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:53.513
NEEDS TO BE A SOURCE VIDEO AND A

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.582
CONVINCING FAKE CAN BE GENERATED

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:56.716
TO MAKE IT APPEAR.

01:50:56.783 --> 01:50:58.485
SOMEONE HAS PARTICIPATED IN A

01:50:58.551 --> 01:50:59.886
SEXUAL ACT.

01:50:59.953 --> 01:51:02.389
LET US BE CLEAR THAT REAL HARM

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:04.991
WILL BE DONE AND THIS PROBLEM

01:51:05.058 --> 01:51:07.027
WILL BECOME WIDESPREAD ALREADY

01:51:07.093 --> 01:51:09.329
STATISTICS FROM RECENT CYBER

01:51:09.396 --> 01:51:10.530
ABUSE STUDIES SHOW.

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:13.066
THEY SHOW US THAT ONE IN TWENTY

01:51:13.133 --> 01:51:14.367
FIVE AMERICANS ONLINE HAVE

01:51:14.434 --> 01:51:16.202
EITHER HAD SENSITIVE EMISSION

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.771
IMAGES POSTED WITHOUT THEIR

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:19.305
PERMISSION OR HAD SOMEONE

01:51:19.372 --> 01:51:21.775
THREATEN TO POST PHOTOS OF THEM.

01:51:21.841 --> 01:51:24.644
THOSE STATISTICS ONLY GET WORSE

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:26.346
WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUNG PEOPLE

01:51:26.413 --> 01:51:31.151
ONE IN FOURTEEN YOUNG WOMEN ONE

01:51:31.217 --> 01:51:33.153
IN TEN AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBT

01:51:33.219 --> 01:51:34.454
COMMUNITY ONE IN.

01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:36.790
SIX OF THESE VICTIMS A SICKENING

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:41.127
51% AGAIN THAT'S 51% INDICATED

01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:42.896
THEY CONSIDERED SUICIDE WITH

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:44.831
DEBATE TECHNOLOGY THIS PROBLEM

01:51:44.898 --> 01:51:46.533
WILL BECOME EVEN MORE PERVASIVE

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.568
AS ACTUAL MATERIAL CONSIDERED.

01:51:48.635 --> 01:51:50.503
A SENSITIVE IS NO LONGER THAN

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:51.671
REQUIRED.

01:51:51.738 --> 01:51:54.140
AS YOU CONSIDER A. B. TWELVE

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:55.809
EIGHTY I IMPLORE YOU TO CONSIDER

01:51:55.875 --> 01:51:58.545
A FEW KEY POINTS WE KNOW THAT AS

01:51:58.611 --> 01:52:00.513
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES SO DO OUR

01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:01.614
LOSS.

01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:03.349
THIS BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:05.618
TAILORED TO TARGET ONLY

01:52:05.685 --> 01:52:07.253
MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:08.755
FAKES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.657
DISTRIBUTED AND THAT ARE

01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:11.858
REASONABLE THAT ARE.

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.626
THAT A REASONABLE PERSON CANNOT

01:52:13.693 --> 01:52:15.662
DIFFERENTIATE FROM REALITY

01:52:15.728 --> 01:52:17.230
THOUSANDS OF THESE VIDEOS

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:19.332
ALREADY EXIST THAT ARE CAUSING

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:21.468
SIGNIFICANT MENTAL ANGUISH AND

01:52:21.534 --> 01:52:23.103
REAL REPUTATIONAL HARM.

01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.137
WE HAVE ACTED TO PROTECT

01:52:24.204 --> 01:52:25.805
CALIFORNIANS FROM SUBSTANTIALLY

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:28.174
SIMILAR DANGER IN REVENGE PORN

01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:30.910
JUST SIX YEARS AGO AND LASTLY WE

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:33.713
KNOW THIS PROBLEM IS ONLY GOING

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:34.314
TO GET WORSE.

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:36.449
IN ADDITION WE HAVE DEVELOPED A

01:52:36.516 --> 01:52:37.817
AND AND PLAN TO INCORPORATE

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:39.786
LANGUAGE TO FURTHER REFINE AND

01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:41.221
TAYLOR THE DEFINITION OF DEEP

01:52:41.287 --> 01:52:42.021
BREAKS.

01:52:42.088 --> 01:52:43.790
AND DEEPLY CREATION SO THAT WE

01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:46.659
CAN ALL BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

01:52:46.726 --> 01:52:48.194
THAT THIS BILL ONLY TARGETS THE

01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:49.696
INTENTIONAL CREATION OF

01:52:49.762 --> 01:52:51.131
MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:52.132
BREAKS.

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:53.433
SO BECAUSE OF THESE PROMISED

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.201
AMENDMENTS YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER

01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:56.703
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS

01:52:56.769 --> 01:52:58.438
LEGISLATION SHOULD YOU ALLOW IT

01:52:58.505 --> 01:52:59.706
TO PROCEED NOW.

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:01.574
AND WE BELIEVE GIVEN THE URGENCY

01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:03.076
OF THE SITUATION AND THE CURRENT

01:53:03.143 --> 01:53:04.444
LEVEL OF RISK.

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:05.879
THE PRUDENT COURSE IS TO

01:53:05.945 --> 01:53:07.814
CONSIDER THE LEGISLATION FULLY

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:08.882
THIS YEAR.

01:53:08.948 --> 01:53:10.683
I BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:12.585
TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS ISSUE

01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:14.354
WE MUST ACT BEFORE MALICIOUS

01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:15.488
PORNOGRAPHIC DEPICTS BECOME A

01:53:15.555 --> 01:53:17.657

01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:18.558
HOMES.

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:20.293
AND WORKPLACES THREATENING EVEN

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.128
MORE OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:25.031
FRIENDS AND YES OUR FAMILIES.

THE NEW AND FRIGHTENING DANGER

01:54:08.908 --> 01:54:11.277
CREATED BY DEEP FAKE TECHNOLOGY

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:12.812
SPECIFICALLY IN THIS CASE

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:15.949
MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP FIX.

01:54:16.015 --> 01:54:17.317
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON

01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:19.385
DISCUSSED DEEP FIX OUR FORD'S

VIDEOS CREATED VIA ARTIFICIAL

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:22.488
INTELLIGENCE WHERE PERSONS

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:24.090
LIKENESS INCLUDING THEIR FACE

01:54:24.157 --> 01:54:26.893
AND VOICE IS REALISTICALLY

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:29.195
SWAPPED WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S. TO

01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:32.131
BE CLEAR DEEP FAKES LOOK REAL.

01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:34.334
THIS IS NOT AN ABILITY WE HAVE

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.669
EVER SEEN BEFORE AT LEAST

01:54:36.736 --> 01:54:38.471
OUTSIDE OF HOLLYWOOD.

01:54:38.538 --> 01:54:39.439
AND BECAUSE OF THIS HYPER

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.374
REALISM OF DEEP TAKE TECHNOLOGY

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:42.875
WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED BY ITS

01:54:42.942 --> 01:54:44.711
POTENTIAL FOR CYBER BULLING IN

01:54:44.777 --> 01:54:47.614
HARASSMENT AMONG OTHER CONCERNS.

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:49.549
AND THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:50.850
FOR THIS CONCERN.

01:54:50.917 --> 01:54:52.118
SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF DEEP

USED TO EXTENT THEY'VE ALREADY

01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:58.625
BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY TO INSERT

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:04.964
MANY OF THESE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:06.966
CELEBRITIES BUT ALSO NON PUBLIC

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:08.768
PERSONS HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR

01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:11.404
EXAMPLE A CALIFORNIA WOMAN WITH

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:13.006
A YOUNG CHILD WAS TARGETED.

01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:14.841
SHE BECAME WRACKED WITH FEAR AND

01:55:14.907 --> 01:55:16.609
SEVERE ANGUISH OVER THE

IT [inaudible]

01:56:56.376 --> 01:56:58.711
GOOD MORNING.

01:56:58.778 --> 01:56:59.645
KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF

01:56:59.712 --> 01:57:02.915
CALIFORNIA.

01:57:02.982 --> 01:57:04.417
AB TWELVE EIGHTY WOULD IMPOSE

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:05.985
CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON CERTAIN

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:07.553
FORMS OF SPEECH.

01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:09.255
THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS IS

01:57:09.322 --> 01:57:10.656
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO

01:57:10.723 --> 01:57:11.691
CREATE THE SPEECH IS SO

01:57:11.758 --> 01:57:12.792
DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:14.160
TECHNOLOGIES AS TO MAKE THE

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:15.528
LIKELIHOOD THAT THE FALSE

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:17.163
REPRESENTATIONS WILL BE BELIEVED

01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:18.331
MUCH GREATER.

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:20.032
THEREBY INCREASING THE HARM

01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:21.601
CAUSED BY THOSE REPRESENTATIONS

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:23.136
TO A DEGREE THAT REQUIRES THE

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:24.704
STATE TO IMPOSE CRIMINAL

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.672
SANCTIONS.

01:57:26.739 --> 01:57:28.107
BUT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE LONG BEEN

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:29.409
ABLE TO DEPICT THINGS THAT DID

01:57:29.475 --> 01:57:31.477
NOT ACTUALLY OCCUR USING IMAGES

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:33.212
AND USING SPOKEN AND WRITTEN

01:57:33.279 --> 01:57:35.014
LANGUAGE AS LONG AS WE'VE BEEN

01:57:35.081 --> 01:57:36.849
DOING IT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:38.684
DECEIVED BY THESE DEPICTIONS.

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:39.886
AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:41.287
BY THOSE FALSEHOODS.

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:42.722
WHEN A DEEP FAKE VIDEOS

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:43.823
DISTRIBUTED ON THE INTERNET THE

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:45.825
LIKELIHOOD OF FOOLING PEOPLE IS

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:47.427
IS NOT GREATER IN THE NATURE OF

01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:49.061
THE HARM IS NOT DIFFERENT THAN

01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:51.564
ONE A FALSE STORY IS DISTRIBUTED

01:57:51.631 --> 01:57:53.533
OR FAKED PHOTOGRAPH?

01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:55.535
WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE DANGER OF

01:57:55.601 --> 01:57:56.102
ALLOWING THE GOVERNMENT TO

01:57:56.169 --> 01:57:58.171
CRIMINALLY PROECUTE INDIVIDUALS

01:57:58.237 --> 01:57:59.639
FOR MAKING OR DISTRIBUTING FALSE

01:57:59.705 --> 01:58:01.407
STATEMENTS THINK OF THE IMPACT

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:02.742
ON NEWS REPORTING.

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:04.644
IF THE DOWNSIDE OF A WRONG CALL

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:06.913
AS TO TO THE THE LEGITIMACY AND

01:58:06.979 --> 01:58:09.615
AND TRUTHFULNESS OF SOME OF OF A

01:58:09.682 --> 01:58:10.683
PIECE OF MEDIA.

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:13.886
IS A POTENTIAL FELONY CONVICTION.

01:58:13.953 --> 01:58:15.321
EXISTING LAWS ALREADY ALLOW FOR

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:17.023
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR MUCH OF

01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:18.257
THE ACTIVITY COVERED IN THIS

01:58:18.324 --> 01:58:20.693
BILL INCLUDING REAL OR FAKE

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:21.894
CHILD ****.

CIVIL REMEDIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:25.198
OTHER TYPES OF BEHAVIOR SUCH AS

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:26.999
A FAKE PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEO THAT

01:58:27.066 --> 01:58:28.267
IS DISTRIBUTED.

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:30.036
CALIFORNIA NEED NOT RESPOND TO

01:58:30.102 --> 01:58:31.137
THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY BY

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:32.371
INFRINGING ON THE FREE SPEECH

PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS WHILE

01:58:35.374 --> 01:58:36.542
CONTINUING TO PROTECT THOSE

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:38.377
HARMED BY FALSE AND HARMFUL

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:39.879

AMENDING THE BILL AND TAKING OUT

01:58:55.127 --> 01:58:56.829
THE ELECTION PIECE UNFORTUNATELY

01:58:56.896 --> 01:58:59.532
WE STILL NEED TO OPPOSE THE BILL.

01:58:59.599 --> 01:59:02.335
AND ONE THING THAT I WOULD GO UP

01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:04.570

LIKE THIS THE COURT THEN

01:59:18.484 --> 01:59:21.020
INTERPRETED AS THEY WILL.

01:59:21.087 --> 01:59:23.456
AND IT BECOMES -- SORT OF

01:59:23.523 --> 01:59:26.926
CREEPING CRIMINALIZATION IN FOR

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:27.860
TWENTY TWO IT HAS SPECIFIC

01:59:27.927 --> 01:59:29.595
LANGUAGE THE SAYS IMMEDIATE

01:59:29.662 --> 01:59:30.863
THREAT.

01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:32.398
ON ITS SAYS IT MUST BE

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:33.699
UNCONDITIONAL.

01:59:33.766 --> 01:59:36.636
AND IN ORDER TO BE CRIMINAL --

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:37.904
THE COURTS HOWEVER AN

01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:39.939
APPLICATION HAVE ELIMINATED

01:59:40.006 --> 01:59:41.440
THESE REQUIREMENTS DESPITE THE

VERY PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE

01:59:43.342 --> 01:59:44.477
STATUTE.

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:45.611
AND THEY HAVE ALLOWED A

01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:47.580
CONVICTION TO STAND EVEN IF THE

01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:48.814
THREAT IS CONDITIONAL.

01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:51.717
AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT IMMEDIATE

01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:53.786
SO WE FOUR SEE THE SAME KIND OF

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:54.754
CREEP BEING.

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:57.857

OF MR GRAYSON SO AS I READ IT

02:01:54.173 --> 02:01:55.574
THE PART THAT CONCERNS ME THE

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.109
MOST OF THE EXPLOITATION OF

02:01:57.176 --> 02:01:58.711
GIRLS AND BOYS UNDER EIGHTEEN

02:01:58.778 --> 02:01:59.578
YEARS OLD BUT AS I READ IT WE

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:14.326
STATUTE WHERE IT MAY BE

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:16.095

02:02:16.162 --> 02:02:17.096
TECHNOLOGY.

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:18.631
IT TAKES IT TO A COMPLETELY

02:02:18.698 --> 02:02:20.332
DIFFERENT LEVEL BY WHICH THE LAW

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:21.667
NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO ADDRESS

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:24.203
THE NEW TECHNOLOGY I WILL ALLOW.

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:26.706
IT THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY

02:02:26.772 --> 02:02:28.741
HAVE MY EXPERT WITNESS BE ABLE

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:30.843
TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL AS THE

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:33.779
THE FREE SPEECH -- THAT

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:35.681
OPPOSITION PRODUCT QUESTION NOW

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:36.148
MY SECOND QUESTION.

02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:37.850
SO MY SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:39.652
FREE SPEECH BUT SO TWO THREE

02:02:39.719 --> 02:02:40.619
ELEVEN I MEAN IT'S THREE ELEVEN

02:02:40.686 --> 02:02:42.054
INCLUDE SIMULATING SEXUAL

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:43.489
CONTENT INCLUDING THAT THIS

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.291
COMPUTER GENERATED SO I GUESS I

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:46.425
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT.

02:02:46.492 --> 02:02:50.796
WOULD BE DIFFERENT SO IF I

02:02:50.863 --> 02:02:52.698
UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY -- THE WAY

02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:53.332
THE LAW IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW THE

02:02:53.399 --> 02:02:53.966
COURT ALREADY RULED IT ACTUALLY

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:55.968
REQUIRES THAT PERSON TO BE IN

02:02:56.035 --> 02:02:58.237
THE ACT -- WHERE AS WITH DEEP

02:02:58.304 --> 02:03:00.072
FAKE THE PERSON DOESN'T EVEN

02:03:00.139 --> 02:03:02.208
HAVE TO KNOW OR BE INVOLVED IN

02:03:02.274 --> 02:03:03.609
ANY ACT WHATSOEVER?

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:05.978
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE READS

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:08.347
IMAGES OF THAT PERSON AND TAKES

02:03:08.414 --> 02:03:10.483
THOSE IMAGES AND M. PUTS IT INTO

02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:12.384
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VIDEO TO

02:03:12.451 --> 02:03:13.519
MAKE IT LOOK AS THOUGH THAT

02:03:13.586 --> 02:03:15.755
PERSON IS PRESENT IN THAT VIDEO.

02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:17.389
SO THE LAW RIGHT NOW IF I

02:03:17.456 --> 02:03:19.058
UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY ONLY

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:20.760
ADDRESSES THOSE THAT ARE IN THE

02:03:20.826 --> 02:03:21.627
ACTS.

02:03:21.694 --> 02:03:23.929
AND THEN THE CAN DO SOMETHING

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:25.431
BUT THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS.

02:03:25.498 --> 02:03:27.032
THE DEEP FAKE ISSUE WHERE THE

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:30.236
PERSON IS AN EVEN INVOLVED AT

02:03:30.302 --> 02:03:31.937
ALL SO THE COURTS HAVE.

02:03:32.004 --> 02:03:33.305
INTERPRETING HERE GENERATED IS

02:03:33.372 --> 02:03:34.173
NOT.

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:35.374
DEEP THINKERS THAT.

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:36.108
AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR THESE

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:37.409
VALUES RESPONSE ACT THAT

02:03:37.476 --> 02:03:38.844
SURPRISES ME BUT MAYBE THERE'S A

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:41.514
CASE IT'S NOT YES I WILL YES I'M

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:43.883
HAPPY TO HAVE HIM HE'S A LOT

02:03:43.949 --> 02:03:44.817
MORE YEAH.

02:03:44.884 --> 02:03:46.485
THERE IS A CASE ON SECTION THREE

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:47.353
ELEVEN POINT ELEVEN IT'S THE

02:03:47.419 --> 02:03:51.390
GERBER CASE -- DECIDED IN -- TWO

02:03:51.457 --> 02:03:51.991
THOUSAND ELEVEN THE COURT IN

02:03:52.057 --> 02:03:53.459
THAT CASE HELD THAT THE PHRASE

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:55.494
THE MATTER DEPICTS A PERSON

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:57.062
UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN YEARS.

02:03:57.129 --> 02:03:59.031
PERSONALLY ENGAGING IN OR

02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:00.933
SIMULATED SEXUAL CONDUCT TO

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.701
REQUIRE REAL CHILD TO ACTUALLY

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:04.270
ENGAGE.

02:04:04.336 --> 02:04:07.406
IN THESE SEXUAL CONDUCT DEPICTED.

02:04:07.473 --> 02:04:08.674
OKAY SO IT WOULD NOT COVER.

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:11.777
DEPICTS AS DEFINED UNDER AB

02:04:11.844 --> 02:04:12.645
TWELVE EIGHTY CAN I ASK THE

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:15.247
ACLU'S THAT YEAR DO YOU HAVE A

02:04:15.314 --> 02:04:16.949
RESPONSE TO THAT THE LIKE.

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:19.718
TO I'M SORRY I'M NOT OKAY OKAY --

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:20.853
AND THEN YES MY SECOND QUESTION

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:23.556
IS I AM ACTUALLY I'M SORRY I

02:04:23.622 --> 02:04:24.824
FORGOT YOUR NAME.

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:26.525
WHITNEY BUT I AM.

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:28.627
YOU KNOW I I AGREE WITH MR

02:04:28.694 --> 02:04:30.196
LACKEY OF IT I'M NOT SUPER

02:04:30.262 --> 02:04:31.330
CONCERNED ABOUT EXPLOITING

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:33.265
CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN WHEN IT

02:04:33.332 --> 02:04:34.567
COMES TO FREE SPEECH ESPECIALLY --

02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:35.868
AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD PASS

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:37.670
MUSTER AND SO I'M CURIOUS TO

02:04:37.736 --> 02:04:38.604
KNOW WHAT YOUR FREE SPEECH

02:04:38.671 --> 02:04:40.806
CONCERNS ARE BECAUSE THE FREEDOM

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:41.841
OF SPEECH IS OBVIOUSLY.

02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:43.108
WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO CHILL IT

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:44.777
WHERE IT IS LEGITIMATE -- SHORE

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:47.847
AND AND CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT AT A

02:04:47.913 --> 02:04:49.181
PROPONENT OF EXPLOITING.

02:04:49.248 --> 02:04:50.182
REACH CHARTER AND I HOPE THAT

02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:51.517
WOULD BE.

02:04:51.584 --> 02:04:54.453
A VERY CLEAR TO EVERYONE HERE

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.589
BUT WAS THERE -- WE HAVE A

02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:59.425
NUMBER OF CONCERNS ONE IS THE

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:01.760
BILL APPLIES NOT ONLY -- TO IT

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:03.062
APPLIES TO DISTRIBUTION AND I

02:05:03.128 --> 02:05:04.630
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.165
AMENDMENTS PUT IN TO TRY AND

02:05:06.232 --> 02:05:07.099
CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL LIKE

02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:08.801
THEY'RE STILL UNCLEAR THAT IF

02:05:08.868 --> 02:05:12.371
THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS --

02:05:12.438 --> 02:05:14.240
EVEN JUST DISTRIBUTOR CLIPS THAT

02:05:14.306 --> 02:05:16.175
THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A

02:05:16.242 --> 02:05:19.245
DEPICTED BECAUSE OF AWAY AN

02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:21.380
ACTUAL EVENT ADDED -- ON THE THE

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:23.883
CHILDREN SPECIFIC PIECE OF THE

02:05:23.949 --> 02:05:24.750
BILL.

02:05:24.817 --> 02:05:26.919
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION SO

02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:28.320
IT COULD APPLY TO SITUATIONS

02:05:28.387 --> 02:05:29.855
THAT ARE NOT JUST PORNOGRAPHIC

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:30.756
AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:32.157
ASHCROFT CASE THAT THE UNITED

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:33.492
STATES SUPREME COURT HAS ISSUED

02:05:33.559 --> 02:05:34.793
THEY TALK ABOUT.

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.061
WHAT ARE THE COMMUNITY STANDARDS

02:05:36.128 --> 02:05:37.763
AND THAT THERE CAN BE SITUATIONS

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:41.867
IN WHICH -- THE DEPICTION OF A

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:43.202
MINOR ENGAGING IN SEXUAL

02:05:43.269 --> 02:05:44.737
ACTIVITY LIKE IN A MOVIE OR

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:45.938
SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE NOT ON

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:48.340
A PORNOGRAPHIC LEVEL NECESSARILY.

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:51.143
COULD BE PROTECTED SPEECH AND SO

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:51.744
THAT'S WHY WE THINK THE BILL

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:53.545
NEEDS TO BE NARROWLY TAILORED TO

02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:55.414
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONCERNS

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:57.416
ARE ADDRESSED.

02:05:57.483 --> 02:05:58.017
MR GRACING CAN ASK IF WE HAVE

02:05:58.083 --> 02:05:59.151
YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK TO

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:01.120
NARROW IT SO AS NOT TO CHILL

02:06:01.186 --> 02:06:03.222
SUCH SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL

02:06:03.289 --> 02:06:04.623
IS VERY NARROWED ALREADY TO

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:07.226
PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL HOWEVER.

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:08.894
WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK

02:06:08.961 --> 02:06:10.829
WITH OPPOSITION TO MAKE EVEN

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.364
MORE CLARITY AS FAR.

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:14.633
AS THE UNDERSTANDING THE BILL BY

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:16.702
OPPOSITION AND THROUGH THE CHAIR

02:06:16.769 --> 02:06:18.404
I JUST WANTED ALSO CLARIFY IT'S

02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:20.572
NOT JUST DISTRIBUTION THE BILL

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:22.007
ACTUALLY IS ATTEMPTING.

02:06:22.074 --> 02:06:24.944
WORKING AT LINKING BOTH CREATION

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:28.347
AND DISTRIBUTION TOGETHER SO --

02:06:28.414 --> 02:06:30.549
SO THAT THERE'S NO LOOPHOLE LEFT

02:06:30.616 --> 02:06:32.551
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A CASE ON

02:06:32.618 --> 02:06:35.020
THIS IF I MAY -- TO THE CHAIR I

02:06:35.087 --> 02:06:36.021
HAVE MY WITNESS BE ABLE TO

02:06:36.088 --> 02:06:40.626
ADDRESS HER ANSWER HER QUESTION.

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:41.527
BUDGET IF IT'S YOU HAVE ANOTHER

02:06:41.593 --> 02:06:43.295
QUESTION.

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:47.533
AS FAR AS THE THE LINKAGE OF THE

02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:48.600
FIRST COMMENT THAT WAS MADE BY

02:06:48.667 --> 02:06:51.670
OPPOSITION AND THEIR ANSWER TO

02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:52.271
THE MEMBER HER QUESTION IS A

02:06:52.338 --> 02:06:52.871
OKAY.

02:06:52.938 --> 02:06:55.007
WELL THEN MY MY ANSWER BACK TO

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:56.709
YOU IS THAT YES WE ARE WORKING

02:06:56.775 --> 02:06:58.811
WITH OPPOSITION BUT WE ALSO

02:06:58.877 --> 02:07:00.145
THROUGH THE CHAIR NEED TO MAKE

02:07:00.212 --> 02:07:01.947
SURE THAT OPPOSITION -- WOULD

02:07:02.014 --> 02:07:04.049
UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL IS NOT

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:05.050
JUST LIMITED TO DISTRIBUTION

02:07:05.117 --> 02:07:06.552
THAT ACTUALLY IN READING THE

02:07:06.618 --> 02:07:08.354
BILL YOU FIND THAT IT'S THE

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:10.789
CREATION AND DISTRIBUTION THAT

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:12.458
IS BEING LINKED -- TO THOSE TWO

02:07:12.524 --> 02:07:13.659
THAT ARE BEING LINKED TOGETHER.

02:07:13.726 --> 02:07:15.627
SO YES WE WILL WORK WITH

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:18.731
OPPOSITION CONTINUE AND

02:07:18.797 --> 02:07:19.932
COMMITTED THANK YOU.

THANK YOU FOR THE CLOSE

02:07:30.209 --> 02:07:31.510
CONSIDERATION OF THIS MEASURE.

02:07:31.577 --> 02:07:33.245
AT ITS HEART THIS BILL IS FAIRLY

02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:34.413
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND NOTHING

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.181
REYES TODAY IS ABSOLUTELY

02:07:36.248 --> 02:07:37.983
UNWORKABLE BUT THIS ISSUE

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:39.451
DEMANDS ACTION.

02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:41.186
CYBER BULLYING IS HAPPENING IN

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:42.221
OUR COMMUNITIES AND NEW

02:07:42.287 --> 02:07:44.823
TECHNOLOGY BRINGS NEW THREATS

02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:46.859
THIS IS UNDENIABLE.

02:07:46.925 --> 02:07:47.960
AS THE PARENT OF TWO CHILDREN

02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:49.395
RATE -- AS THE PARENT OF TWO

02:07:49.461 --> 02:07:51.263
CHILDREN RAISING THEM IN THE

02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:53.232
DIGITAL AGE I'VE FIRST I'VE HAD

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.767
FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF THE

02:07:54.833 --> 02:07:56.535
DANGERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA THE

02:07:56.602 --> 02:07:58.971
INTERNET AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:00.406
IMAGINE IF YOUR CHILD WAS THE

02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:02.508
VICTIM OF AN EXPLICIT DEEP FAKE.

02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:04.176
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE WOULD YOU

02:08:04.243 --> 02:08:05.844

BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE -- AND

02:08:09.648 --> 02:08:11.483
FOR THE UNFORTUNATE ISSUES OF

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:13.552
DEEP FAKES WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:15.120
HAVE RECOURSE TO ENTITIES THAT

02:08:15.187 --> 02:08:16.989
CAN ASSIST IN FINDING THE PERSON

02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:17.956
WHO CREATED.

02:08:18.023 --> 02:08:19.958
AND DISTRIBUTED THE VIDEO THAT

02:08:20.025 --> 02:08:21.827
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IS CAUSING

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:23.462
YOUR CHILD TO CONTEMPLATE

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:24.396
SUICIDE.

02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:26.265
IMAGINE THE PAIN AND TRAUMA THIS

02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:27.533
WOULD INFLICT ON YOUR ENTIRE

02:08:27.599 --> 02:08:29.735
FAMILY I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE

THE FOREFRONT SO WE CAN HAVE A

02:08:44.349 --> 02:08:46.251
ROBUST DISCUSSION -- AND I THINK

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:48.587
WE NEED TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION

02:08:48.654 --> 02:08:52.091
ARE THE CHALLENGES OF IF IT WERE

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:54.093

PARALLEL WOULD BE A FEDERAL

02:29:43.307 --> 02:29:44.375
ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA.

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:46.177
KOTLI CAL ACT BUT SAYS WE HAVE

02:29:46.243 --> 02:29:47.144
TO DO A BY A SEARCH WARRANT

02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:48.212
RIGHT WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO

02:29:48.279 --> 02:29:49.347
HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE AND

02:29:49.413 --> 02:29:50.881
SOMETIMES WE DON'T HAVE PROBABLE

02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:53.984
CAUSE WE NEED TO START WITH WE

02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:55.353
HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS.

02:29:55.419 --> 02:29:56.921
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF A CRIME IS

02:29:56.987 --> 02:29:58.989
BEING COMMITTED YET -- FIRST OF

02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:00.391
ALL I WANT TO SAY TO THE

02:30:00.458 --> 02:30:01.459
PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL IF IT IS

02:30:01.525 --> 02:30:02.993

A SUBPOENA WHEN SOMEBODY'S LIFE

02:30:04.528 --> 02:30:05.363
THE NATURE I HOPE YOU BRING US

02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:06.864
BILLS THAT WILL ADDRESS THAT AS

02:30:06.931 --> 02:30:08.265
WELL BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THE ONLY

02:30:08.332 --> 02:30:09.867
SITUATION WHERE THAT'S A PUBLIC.

02:30:09.934 --> 02:30:12.470
SAFETY ISSUE -- ON TO DEFEND

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:13.804

02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:15.172
PART WE DO GET RESPONSE IN THE

02:30:15.239 --> 02:30:16.707
PHONE CAN BE PAYING THAN AN

02:30:16.774 --> 02:30:17.942
EMERGENCY SITUATION WHERE A

02:30:23.147 --> 02:30:26.283
SO THAT IS NOT RIGHT THAT'S NOT

02:30:26.350 --> 02:30:27.451
SIX WEEKS IT'S EITHER A MEDIA.

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:28.519
DANGER WHICH IS RIGHT NOW

02:30:28.586 --> 02:30:30.020

DAY WEEKS OKAY I'M SO.

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:40.898
NOW KNOWING THAT THIS IS THE

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:42.800
FIRST OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA

02:30:42.867 --> 02:30:44.568
READING THIS LAW IT'S NOT CLEAR

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:45.369
TO ME.

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:45.970
THAT.

02:30:46.036 --> 02:30:48.973
THIS LAW SETS FORTH MUCH IF ANY

02:30:49.039 --> 02:30:50.574
PROCEDURE AS TO WHAT IT WOULD

02:30:50.641 --> 02:30:52.143
MEAN I ASSUME THERE WAS LOT

02:30:52.209 --> 02:30:53.077
ELSEWHERE THAT WOULD SET OUT

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:54.111
WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATIVE

02:30:54.178 --> 02:30:55.980
SUBPOENA PROCESS LOOK LIKE.

02:30:56.046 --> 02:30:58.048
WHO WOULD HAVE TO SIGN IT WHAT

02:30:58.115 --> 02:30:59.583
THE BURDEN WAS BUT?

02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:01.552
KNOWING NOW THAT THERE ISN'T ANY

02:31:01.619 --> 02:31:03.087
THIS LOSS SEEMS.

02:31:03.154 --> 02:31:05.322
MY EBAY IN THAT REGARDS SEEING

02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:08.359
AS I MEAN THE ONLY PARAGRAPH I

02:31:08.426 --> 02:31:14.064
SEE IS THE OPENING PARAGRAPH

02:31:14.131 --> 02:31:17.201
LEAVE.

02:31:17.268 --> 02:31:18.569
YOU KNOW THEY'LL ISSUE IN

02:31:18.636 --> 02:31:19.537

02:31:19.603 --> 02:31:21.639
A MAYOR STRATUS SUBPOENA AND

02:31:21.705 --> 02:31:23.007
THEN WHAT CAN BE ASKED.

02:31:23.073 --> 02:31:25.709
FOR SO I'M JUST WONDERING.

02:31:25.776 --> 02:31:27.211

RESPONSE YES OKAY THANK YOU SO

02:31:29.447 --> 02:31:32.716
WE WERE USING ANOTHER STATES --

KINDA TEMPLATE OKAY FOR THIS IN

02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:37.555
PARTICULAR WYOMING -- HOWEVER IN

02:31:37.621 --> 02:31:39.590
OUR OWN DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS

02:31:39.657 --> 02:31:41.459
DISCUSSIONS WITH OPPOSITION --

02:31:41.525 --> 02:31:42.860
WE HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS TO

02:31:42.927 --> 02:31:45.029
MAKING SURE THAT WE DO HAVE.

02:31:45.095 --> 02:31:47.398
A SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES

02:31:47.465 --> 02:31:48.833
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A FIRST

02:31:48.899 --> 02:31:50.734
YEAR INVESTIGATOR RUNNING OUT

02:31:50.801 --> 02:31:52.236
INTO AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA

02:31:52.303 --> 02:31:54.271
THAT THAT FIRST THAT -- THAT

02:31:54.338 --> 02:31:55.973
INDIVIDUAL -- WITHOUT THAT

02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:57.808
EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE -- TO GET

02:31:57.875 --> 02:31:59.143
THE SIGNATURE OF A COMMANDER IF

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:00.644
I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY AS WELL

02:32:00.711 --> 02:32:03.047
AS USING THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE

02:32:03.113 --> 02:32:05.149
SET UP ON A FEDERAL LEVEL NECK

02:32:05.216 --> 02:32:06.650
NECK AND CAL.

02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:08.118
I CAN'T STAY AT THIS POINT IT

02:32:08.185 --> 02:32:09.687
REQUIRES THE FAITH F. B. I.

02:32:09.753 --> 02:32:11.489
OFFICER IN HIS A SACK HIS

02:32:11.555 --> 02:32:13.858
ASSISTANT -- AREA COMMANDER TO

02:32:13.924 --> 02:32:15.926
SIGN OFF ON THAT SO IT'S NOT

02:32:15.993 --> 02:32:16.360
JUST.

02:32:16.427 --> 02:32:18.195
A YOU KNOW A ONE SIGNATURE THING

02:32:18.262 --> 02:32:19.797
IT DOES REQUIRE REASONABLE

02:32:19.864 --> 02:32:22.032
SUSPICION OF A CRIME AND TWO

02:32:22.099 --> 02:32:23.634
SIGNATURES BOTH THE DETECTIVE

02:32:23.701 --> 02:32:27.872

02:32:27.938 --> 02:32:29.006
HER COMMANDER.

02:32:29.073 --> 02:32:29.940
SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

02:32:30.007 --> 02:32:31.308
WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON

02:32:31.375 --> 02:32:33.077
WITH OPPOSITION AS WELL TO MAKE

02:32:33.143 --> 02:32:34.712
SURE WE CLARIFIED THE THE

02:32:34.778 --> 02:32:36.647
LANGUAGE OF THE BILL SO THAT

02:32:36.714 --> 02:32:39.550
THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR PATHWAY --

02:32:39.617 --> 02:32:40.918
TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA.

02:32:40.985 --> 02:32:43.387

02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:52.029
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I DO HAVE A

02:32:52.096 --> 02:32:53.664

IN A TIME OF STRONG FOURTH

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:57.234
AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS.

02:32:57.301 --> 02:32:58.502
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD

02:32:58.569 --> 02:32:59.803
THING.

02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:01.338
AS WE LEARN HOW TO NAVIGATE

02:33:01.405 --> 02:33:02.907
PRIVACY CONCERNS IN THE INTERNET

02:33:02.973 --> 02:33:04.008
AGE.

02:33:04.074 --> 02:33:05.476
I THINK OUR APPROACH SHOULD BE

02:33:05.543 --> 02:33:07.111
VERY CAUTIOUS.

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:08.145
ONE BUT THE CONVERSATIONSWE

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:09.547
HAVE HAD WITH THOSE WHO HAVE

02:33:09.613 --> 02:33:11.415
ANALYZE THIS BILL HAVE FOCUSED

02:33:11.482 --> 02:33:13.784
SO WITH THE SOLELY ON PRIVACY

02:33:13.851 --> 02:33:16.320
PROTECTIONS AND NOT ON THE HARM

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:18.122
OUR CURRENT LAW ALLOWS.

02:33:18.188 --> 02:33:19.290
AGAINST ONE OF OUR MOST

02:33:19.356 --> 02:33:20.991
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND

02:33:21.058 --> 02:33:22.293
THAT'S OUR CHILDREN.

02:33:22.359 --> 02:33:24.228
ADDITIONALLY IT IS WIDELY

02:33:24.295 --> 02:33:25.763
RECOGNIZED IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM

02:33:25.829 --> 02:33:27.398
THAT THE JOB OF THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:27.464 --> 02:33:29.700
IS TO WORK ON TOUGH AND EMERGING

02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:32.603
ISSUES ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY.

02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:33.904
THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING THAT'S

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:37.074
WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH AB.

02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:37.675
NINE TWENTY EIGHT IF YOU THINK

02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:38.709
THAT PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM

PHYSICAL HARM AND SEX

02:33:40.778 --> 02:33:42.513

02:33:43.614 --> 02:33:44.682
THIS BILL.

02:33:44.748 --> 02:33:45.449
IF YOU THINK THAT THE

02:33:45.516 --> 02:33:47.284
LEGISLATURE SHOULD HANDLE THESE

02:33:47.351 --> 02:33:48.652

03:30:32.086 --> 03:30:33.520
INCREASINGLY IN THE DIGITAL AGE

03:30:33.587 --> 03:30:35.055
THE COLLECTION REPORTING

03:30:35.122 --> 03:30:36.790
ANALYSIS AND TRANSPARENCY OF

03:30:36.857 --> 03:30:38.192
DATA ARE CENTRAL TO GOOD

03:30:38.258 --> 03:30:39.226
GOVERNANCE.

03:30:39.293 --> 03:30:40.828
AND THAT'S WHAT AB THIRTEEN

03:30:40.894 --> 03:30:42.196
THIRTY ONE IS ALL ABOUT GOOD

03:30:42.262 --> 03:30:44.565
GOVERNANCE SINCE NINETEEN

03:30:44.631 --> 03:30:45.165
SEVENTY THREE THE LEGISLATURE

03:30:45.232 --> 03:30:46.600
HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:30:46.667 --> 03:30:47.968
ENSURING THE UNIFORMITY FISHING

03:30:48.035 --> 03:30:49.703
COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF

03:30:49.770 --> 03:30:51.071
CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA.

03:30:51.138 --> 03:30:52.740
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE YET TO

03:30:52.806 --> 03:30:53.540
ACHIEVE THAT VISION AND

03:30:53.607 --> 03:30:55.309
CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:30:55.376 --> 03:30:57.011
DATA IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE.

03:30:57.077 --> 03:30:58.612
THIS HAS MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR

03:30:58.679 --> 03:31:00.481
OUR STATE FIRST THE CRIMINAL

03:31:00.547 --> 03:31:02.082
JUSTICE DATA GAP IS BAD FOR

03:31:02.149 --> 03:31:04.084
PUBLIC SAFETY FOR EXAMPLE THE

03:31:04.151 --> 03:31:05.919
BUREAU OF FIREARMS DEPENDS ON

03:31:05.986 --> 03:31:07.254
THE TIMELY REPORTING OF CAMP OF

03:31:07.321 --> 03:31:09.023
CONVICTION INFORMATION. TO

03:31:09.089 --> 03:31:10.524
ENSURE THAT PROHIBITED PERSONS

03:31:10.591 --> 03:31:11.925

POSSESS OR ACQUIRE GUNS.

03:31:15.596 --> 03:31:17.398
SECOND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA

03:31:17.464 --> 03:31:18.465
GAP IS BAD FOR GOVERNMENT

03:31:18.532 --> 03:31:20.501
TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT

03:31:20.567 --> 03:31:22.736
TRANSPARENCY IS ACCOUNTABILITY

03:31:22.803 --> 03:31:24.104
CURRENTLY TOO MANY ASPECTS OF

03:31:24.171 --> 03:31:25.439
THE CRIMINAL PROCESS ARE HIDDEN

03:31:25.506 --> 03:31:27.641
FROM VIEW FROM VIEW WHICH BREEDS

03:31:27.708 --> 03:31:28.909

THIRD THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA

03:31:30.577 --> 03:31:32.880
GAP IS BAD FOR PUBLIC POLICY.

03:31:32.946 --> 03:31:34.114
I WOULD CONTEND THAT EVERY BILL

03:31:34.181 --> 03:31:35.716

03:31:37.351 --> 03:31:38.652
TO PROJECT ITS IMPACT AND

03:31:38.719 --> 03:31:40.154
ESTIMATE THE COST.

03:31:40.220 --> 03:31:41.288
IN TRYING TO MEASURE RACIAL

03:31:41.355 --> 03:31:42.623
DISPARITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

03:31:42.689 --> 03:31:44.625
DEATH SENTENCES WE ARE LIMITED

03:31:44.691 --> 03:31:45.659
BY THE DATA GAP.

03:31:45.726 --> 03:31:47.361
IN ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF EARLY

03:31:47.428 --> 03:31:48.729
DISCHARGE FROM POST RELEASE

03:31:48.796 --> 03:31:51.365
COMMUNITY SUPERVISION WE ARE

03:31:51.432 --> 03:31:52.666
LIMITED BY THE DATA GAP.

03:31:52.733 --> 03:31:53.934
IN MEASURING RECIDIVISM

03:31:54.001 --> 03:31:55.369
ASSOCIATED WITH CDC OUR

03:31:55.436 --> 03:31:57.371
PROGRAMMING WE ARE LIMITED BY

03:31:57.438 --> 03:31:58.439
THE DATA GAP.

03:31:58.505 --> 03:32:00.340
AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE WILL

03:32:00.407 --> 03:32:02.209

03:32:47.721 --> 03:32:49.456

ON ITS FACE THIS ISSUE IS MUCH

03:33:00.667 --> 03:33:01.301

03:33:05.772 --> 03:33:07.007
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT HIGH

03:33:07.074 --> 03:33:08.976
QUALITY CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA IS

03:33:09.042 --> 03:33:10.310

THESE OTHER INITIATIVES.

03:33:13.847 --> 03:33:15.349
IF THE STATE DOES NOT EXIST IF

NO WAY TO IDENTIFY OUR MOST

03:33:22.523 --> 03:33:23.790

THIS WORK AROUND IS NOT ONLY

03:36:03.317 --> 03:36:04.651
INEFFICIENT BUT IT CAN LEAD TO

03:36:04.718 --> 03:36:06.386

ESSENTIAL DATA POINTS.

03:36:11.358 --> 03:36:12.793
THIS IS BECAUSE EACH DATA POINT

03:36:12.859 --> 03:36:14.528

03:55:52.137 --> 03:55:54.173
TREATMENT AND SO SITES SUCH AS

03:55:54.240 --> 03:55:54.773
THE OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES

03:55:54.840 --> 03:55:56.909
SUCH AS THIS ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE

03:55:56.976 --> 03:55:58.410
PEOPLE TO REALLY EARLY LEVEL AND

03:55:58.477 --> 03:56:00.312
THEN BE ABLE TO MOVE THEM ALONG.

03:56:00.379 --> 03:56:02.381
INTO A CONTINUUM OF CARE.

03:56:02.448 --> 03:56:03.582
THE SECOND MYTH IS THAT SITES

03:56:03.649 --> 03:56:05.484
SUCH AS THIS ATTRACT A CRIMINAL

03:56:05.551 --> 03:56:06.385
ELEMENT.

03:56:06.452 --> 03:56:09.054
OR A CREATE KIND OF CRIME OR

03:56:09.121 --> 03:56:11.824
MIGHT LEAD TO DO YOU A D. WEISS.

03:56:11.891 --> 03:56:13.526
AND SO I WILL TELL YOU FOR ONE

03:56:13.592 --> 03:56:14.193
THING THERE ARE PEOPLE PUBLICLY

03:56:14.260 --> 03:56:15.861
USING DRUGS IN AN UNSUPERVISED

03:56:15.928 --> 03:56:17.796
WAY IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND

03:56:17.863 --> 03:56:20.299
SO THERE ARE ALWAYS CONCERNS

03:56:20.366 --> 03:56:22.401
THAT PEOPLE -- MADE MAYBE MAY

03:56:22.468 --> 03:56:23.802
OPERATE VEHICLES WITH OR WITHOUT

03:56:23.869 --> 03:56:25.804
THE SITES WITH THESE SITES OFFER

03:56:25.871 --> 03:56:27.640
THESE OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES.

03:56:27.706 --> 03:56:29.041
IS THE ABILITY TO OBSERVE PEOPLE

03:56:29.108 --> 03:56:30.843
PRIOR TO THEM LEAVING AND GOING

03:56:30.910 --> 03:56:32.278
BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY

03:56:32.344 --> 03:56:34.079
WHICH PUBLIC DRUG USE DOES NOT

03:56:34.146 --> 03:56:36.515
ALLOW -- FOR THE TREATMENT

03:56:36.582 --> 03:56:37.616
PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE

03:56:37.683 --> 03:56:39.118
TYPICALLY HAVE VERY VULNERABLE

03:56:39.184 --> 03:56:39.952
PEOPLE WHO COME TO THEM WERE

03:56:40.019 --> 03:56:40.753
VERY.

03:56:40.819 --> 03:56:41.287
AMBIVALENT ABOUT BEING IN

03:56:41.353 --> 03:56:42.054
TREATMENT.

03:56:42.121 --> 03:56:43.255
SOMETIMES THEY WANT TO BE THERE

03:56:43.322 --> 03:56:44.290
AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T.

03:56:44.356 --> 03:56:45.291
SO YOU WOULD THINK WE WOULD

03:56:45.357 --> 03:56:46.525
ATTRACT A WHOLE LOT OF DRUG

03:56:46.592 --> 03:56:48.060
DEALERS WILL BE LIKE A RIGHT

03:56:48.127 --> 03:56:50.529
PLACE TO RECRUIT DRUG USE.

03:56:50.596 --> 03:56:52.531
BUT IN FACT IN EVERY INSTANCE WE

03:56:52.598 --> 03:56:53.832
IMPROVE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE

03:56:53.899 --> 03:56:55.935

03:56:57.570 --> 03:56:59.204
THINK THAT IS NOT EVER BEEN

03:56:59.271 --> 03:57:00.472

04:17:19.891 --> 04:17:21.425
ON THIS ISSUE BUT WE ARE

04:17:21.492 --> 04:17:24.061
PROPOSING TODAY -- THE USE OF

04:17:24.128 --> 04:17:25.129
CHEMICAL AGENTS IN CALIFORNIA

04:17:25.196 --> 04:17:28.432
JUVENILE FACILITIES OBVIOUSLY.

04:17:28.499 --> 04:17:29.767
YOUR CLOTHES SORRY ABOUT THAT.

04:17:29.834 --> 04:17:30.902
IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE THAT

04:17:30.968 --> 04:17:32.336
DESERVES CAREFUL THOUGHTFUL AND

04:17:32.403 --> 04:17:34.305
BALANCED STUDY IT'S VITAL THAT

04:17:34.372 --> 04:17:35.673
CALIFORNIA'S POLICYMAKERS AND

04:17:35.740 --> 04:17:37.041
PUBLIC HAVE ACCESS TO

04:17:37.108 --> 04:17:38.476
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW CHEMICAL

04:17:38.543 --> 04:17:39.811
AGENTS ARE CURRENTLY USED IN

04:17:39.877 --> 04:17:40.745
CALIFORNIA.

04:17:40.812 --> 04:17:41.813
AND ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICES

04:17:41.879 --> 04:17:43.548
THAT EXIST HERE AND NATIONALLY

04:17:43.614 --> 04:17:46.617
ON THE ISSUE BUT UNFORTUNATELY

04:17:46.684 --> 04:17:47.218
EIGHTY SIX NINETY SIX DOES NOT

04:17:47.285 --> 04:17:48.653
PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION THAT'S

04:17:48.719 --> 04:17:50.288
NECESSARY TO MAKE THOUGHTFUL

04:17:50.354 --> 04:17:53.090
POLICY DECISIONS -- AB SIX

04:17:53.157 --> 04:17:54.225
NINETY SIX CALLS FOR RESEARCH ON

04:17:54.292 --> 04:17:55.726
THE IMPACTS AND EFFICACY OF

04:17:55.793 --> 04:17:56.994
USING PEPPER SPRAY ON YOUNG

04:17:57.061 --> 04:17:58.129
PEOPLE.

04:17:58.196 --> 04:17:59.564
BUT THE RESEARCH ON THOSE ISSUES

04:17:59.630 --> 04:18:01.299
IS ALREADY CLEAR THE USE OF

04:18:01.365 --> 04:18:03.434
CHEMICAL AGENTS IS HARMFUL TO

04:18:03.501 --> 04:18:04.468
YOUNG PEOPLE BOTH PHYSICALLY AND

04:18:04.535 --> 04:18:06.037
PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND IT IMPEDES

04:18:06.103 --> 04:18:07.772
REHABILITATION BY HARMING THE

04:18:07.839 --> 04:18:09.774
TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

04:18:09.841 --> 04:18:13.477
SEVEN YOUTH THAT IS CRITICAL TO

04:18:13.544 --> 04:18:15.012
CHANGING YOUNG PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR.

04:18:15.079 --> 04:18:15.913
MOREOVER AB SIX NINETY SIX WOULD

04:18:15.980 --> 04:18:16.781
NOT REQUIRE ANY AN ANALYSIS OF

04:18:16.848 --> 04:18:17.882
HOW CHEMICAL AGENTS ARE USED IN

04:18:17.949 --> 04:18:20.051
CALIFORNIA OR CONSIDERATION OF

04:18:20.117 --> 04:18:21.719
BEST PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA AND

04:18:21.786 --> 04:18:23.187
NATIONALLY THAT MAY SELECT SERVE

04:18:23.254 --> 04:18:25.122
AS ALTERNATIVES TO THE USE OF

04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:26.257
PEPPER SPRAY.

04:18:26.324 --> 04:18:28.059
NOR WOULD AB SIX NINETY SIX

04:18:28.125 --> 04:18:28.593
REQUIRE THAT EITHER THE

04:18:28.659 --> 04:18:30.194
RESULTING STUDY OR ENTER ANY

04:18:30.261 --> 04:18:32.029
UNDERLYING DATA ON THE USE OF

04:18:32.096 --> 04:18:34.632
CHEMICAL AGENTS BE MADE PUBLIC.

04:18:34.699 --> 04:18:35.299
EIGHTY SIX NINETY SIX WOULD ALSO

04:18:35.366 --> 04:18:36.100
VAST THE BOARD OF STATE IN

04:18:36.167 --> 04:18:37.702
COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS RATHER

04:18:37.768 --> 04:18:38.502
THAN A NEUTRAL BODY WITH SOLE

04:18:38.569 --> 04:18:40.171
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHOOSING A

04:18:40.238 --> 04:18:41.806
RESEARCH ENTITY TO CONDUCT THE

04:18:41.873 --> 04:18:42.773
STUDY.

04:18:42.840 --> 04:18:43.608
IN ADDITION THE BILL WOULD

04:18:43.674 --> 04:18:44.675
REQUIRE THE STUDY TO BE

04:18:44.742 --> 04:18:46.077
CONDUCTED BY RESEARCH AGENCY

04:18:46.143 --> 04:18:47.678
WITH A FOCUS ON INSTITUTIONAL

04:18:47.745 --> 04:18:49.213
CARE FOR YOUTH BUT WAS WHICH IS

04:18:49.280 --> 04:18:51.349
ALSO NEUTRAL WITH REGARD TO THE

04:18:51.415 --> 04:18:52.683
USE OF CHEMICAL SPRING ON YOUTH.

04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:54.619
THE REALITY IS THAT RESEARCH AND

04:18:54.685 --> 04:18:55.920
AGENCIES WITH A FOCUS ON

04:18:55.987 --> 04:18:57.288
INSTITUTIONAL CARE FOR YOUTH

04:18:57.355 --> 04:18:58.623
ALREADY HAVE A POSITION ON

04:18:58.689 --> 04:19:02.026
CHEMICAL SPRAY USE THAT THE BEST

04:19:02.093 --> 04:19:02.793
PRACTICES TO BAN IT.

04:19:02.860 --> 04:19:04.262
ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

04:19:04.328 --> 04:19:05.563
ON THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS IN

04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:07.164
CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS

04:19:07.231 --> 04:19:08.499
NECESSARY.

04:19:08.566 --> 04:19:10.401
THE STUDY EIGHTY SIX NINETY SIX

04:19:10.468 --> 04:19:11.102
WOULD CREATE WOULD NOT MEET THIS

04:19:11.168 --> 04:19:12.103
NEED.

04:19:12.169 --> 04:19:13.938
UNLIKE AB THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE A

04:19:14.005 --> 04:19:14.906
MEASURE THAT WAS RECENTLY PASSED

04:19:14.972 --> 04:19:17.508
BY THIS COMMITTEE. EIGHTY SIX

04:19:17.575 --> 04:19:18.142
NINETY SIX DOES NOT CREATE THE

04:19:18.209 --> 04:19:20.411
NATIONAL NECESSARY TRANSPARENCY

04:19:20.478 --> 04:19:23.080
OR PROVIDE POLICYMAKERS WITH THE

04:19:23.147 --> 04:19:24.515
INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED.

04:19:24.582 --> 04:19:26.384
TO HAVE OBJECTIVE POLICY

04:19:26.450 --> 04:19:27.051
GUIDANCE TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS

04:19:27.118 --> 04:19:29.020
ISSUE. FOR THESE REASONS WE

04:19:29.086 --> 04:19:31.789
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO WAY

WOULD ECHO ON THE COMMENTS OF MY

04:19:38.963 --> 04:19:40.798
COLLEAGUE BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY

04:19:40.865 --> 04:19:43.200
THAT SB SIX NINE SIX IS

04:19:43.267 --> 04:19:44.368
UNNECESSARY.

04:19:44.435 --> 04:19:46.070

04:19:46.137 --> 04:19:47.438
EFFECTS OF PEPPER SPRAY ON

04:19:47.505 --> 04:19:48.773
NEWMAN CERTAINLY CHEN.

04:19:48.839 --> 04:19:51.208
IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF

04:19:51.275 --> 04:19:52.977
STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS

04:19:53.044 --> 04:19:55.579
HAS A FACTSHEET ON THEIR WEBSITE

04:19:55.646 --> 04:19:57.648
LISTING SEVERAL OF THE STUDIES

04:19:57.715 --> 04:19:59.317
RIGHT NOW ONE OF THEM IS THE

CHEMICAL AGENTS IN JUVENILE

04:20:15.533 --> 04:20:17.668
FACILITIES SO THAT THE STATE

04:20:17.735 --> 04:20:20.404
BOARD ALREADY HAS THESE STUDIES

04:20:20.471 --> 04:20:23.140

THIRTY FIVE STATES NOW DETENTION

04:20:30.314 --> 04:20:34.318
HALLS -- AND I THINK THAT IT'S

04:20:34.385 --> 04:20:36.087
TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN

04:20:36.153 --> 04:20:37.621
THOSE STATES.

04:20:37.688 --> 04:20:39.857

04:21:16.560 --> 04:21:18.329
APPRECIATE THAT I THINK -- AT A

04:21:18.396 --> 04:21:19.697
THROUGH THE CHAIR -- YOU KNOW I

04:21:19.764 --> 04:21:20.431
THINK I THINK FOR US WE

04:21:20.498 --> 04:21:21.098
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S

04:21:21.165 --> 04:21:22.867
DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR AND BOTH

04:21:22.933 --> 04:21:23.534
PREVIOUSLY IN THIS COMMITTEE ON

04:21:23.601 --> 04:21:26.103
ON BILLS RELATED TO THIS ISSUE

04:21:26.170 --> 04:21:26.604
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

04:21:26.670 --> 04:21:28.639
IMPORTANT. TO TO SEE PARK IN AND

04:21:28.706 --> 04:21:29.840
TO THE CHIEFS THAT WERE ENGAGING

04:21:29.907 --> 04:21:30.941
IN THIS CONVERSATION NOT HAVE

04:21:31.008 --> 04:21:32.910
ALREADY ANSWERED THE QUESTION OF

04:21:32.977 --> 04:21:34.245
WHAT TO DO THAT WE REALLY ARE

04:21:34.311 --> 04:21:35.946
OPEN TO SAYING LET'S LOOK AT ALL

04:21:36.013 --> 04:21:37.581
OF THE DYNAMICS INVOLVED IN THE

04:21:37.648 --> 04:21:39.083
USE OF A SEA SPRAY -- WE

04:21:39.150 --> 04:21:40.418
RECOGNIZE THAT CERTAINLY THERE

04:21:40.484 --> 04:21:42.686
HAVE BEEN -- SOME RESEARCH AND

04:21:42.753 --> 04:21:44.622
FOCUS ON THE USE OF OC SPRAY IN

04:21:44.688 --> 04:21:46.624
CERTAIN CONTEXTS -- AND AND HOW

04:21:46.690 --> 04:21:47.892
IT PERTAINS TO THE YOUTH BUT I

04:21:47.958 --> 04:21:49.160
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT

04:21:49.226 --> 04:21:49.994
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE

04:21:50.061 --> 04:21:51.162
FACTORS INVOLVED.

04:21:51.228 --> 04:21:52.430
THAT THIS COMMITTEE TALKED ABOUT

04:21:52.496 --> 04:21:54.932
LAST YEAR AS IT PERTAINS -- TO

04:21:54.999 --> 04:21:56.467
WHAT WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL

04:21:56.534 --> 04:21:59.070
IMPACTS -- OF NOT HAVING TO

04:21:59.136 --> 04:22:00.838
INTERVENE IN A PHYSICAL MANNER

04:22:00.905 --> 04:22:03.240
BETWEEN -- STAFFING YOUTH BY

04:22:03.307 --> 04:22:05.242
USING OC SPRAY -- AND NOT BEING

04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:07.178
A TACTIC TO DE ESCALATE AGAIN

04:22:07.244 --> 04:22:09.113
VERSUS HAVING TO KIND OF THE USE

04:22:09.180 --> 04:22:11.082
OF PHYSICAL INTERVENTION AND SO

04:22:11.148 --> 04:22:12.416
I THINK -- FOR US WE WANT TO

04:22:12.483 --> 04:22:13.217
MAKE SURE THEY WERE ASKING THE

04:22:13.284 --> 04:22:15.086
QUESTION IN GETTING THE ANSWER

04:22:15.152 --> 04:22:16.520
THROUGH INDEPENDENT RESEARCH

04:22:16.587 --> 04:22:18.089
PART OF THE REASON THE REASON

04:22:18.155 --> 04:22:19.023
THIS WAS STRUCTURED AS IT KIND

04:22:19.090 --> 04:22:20.424
OF INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY

04:22:20.491 --> 04:22:22.860
ENTITY THAT HASN'T YET -- LOOKED

04:22:22.927 --> 04:22:24.528
AT THIS ISSUE OR MADE A POLICY

04:22:24.595 --> 04:22:26.063
DETERMINATION AS WE WANT TO

04:22:26.130 --> 04:22:27.498
AGAIN MAKE SURE IT IS A AN

04:22:27.565 --> 04:22:30.434
INDEPENDENT -- OF FOCUS ON THIS

04:22:30.501 --> 04:22:32.536
THAT IT ISN'T FROM EITHER

04:22:32.603 --> 04:22:34.238
RESEARCH ENTITY THAT HASN'T

04:22:34.305 --> 04:22:36.674
ALREADY -- OPINED ON ELIMINATION

04:22:36.740 --> 04:22:38.375
OR OR NOT AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE

04:22:38.442 --> 04:22:40.344
SURE THAT THIS IS IS -- FRAMED

04:22:40.411 --> 04:22:41.979
AS AS A RESEARCH DRIVEN AND DATA

04:22:42.046 --> 04:22:43.414
DRIVEN AS POSSIBLE SEE POCKETS

04:22:43.481 --> 04:22:45.516
FULLY COMMITTED -- TO WORKING

04:22:45.583 --> 04:22:47.017
OBVIOUSLY WITH -- THE DATA

04:22:47.084 --> 04:22:48.452
ELEMENTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO

04:22:48.519 --> 04:22:50.421
CARRY OUT THIS STUDY -- AND AND

04:22:50.488 --> 04:22:51.755
THE REASON WE STRUCTURED IN THE

PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS PASSED.

04:27:16.887 --> 04:27:18.355
THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION AS

04:27:18.422 --> 04:27:19.823
TO WHETHER MULTIPLE THOUSAND

04:27:19.890 --> 04:27:24.094

NOW BY CODIFYING THESE CASES AB

04:27:27.297 --> 04:27:27.865

IT CLEAR THAT MULTIPLE TO STING.

04:27:30.834 --> 04:27:32.736
BUT YET RELATED INCIDENTS OF

04:27:42.012 --> 04:27:43.414
THEFT.

04:27:43.480 --> 04:27:44.047
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE

04:27:44.114 --> 04:27:44.648
HAD HAS RAISED SOME CONCERNS

04:27:44.715 --> 04:27:45.282
ABOUT WHETHER THIS BILL WILL IN

04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:47.818
FACT AMENDED PROP.

04:27:47.885 --> 04:27:48.952
FORTY SEVEN YESTERDAY I RECEIVED

THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL OR

04:27:50.320 --> 04:27:52.356
OPINION THAT CONCLUDED THAT

04:27:52.423 --> 04:27:54.725
PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN DID NOT

04:27:54.792 --> 04:27:56.527
REPEAL BAILEY THAT IS THE CASE

04:27:56.593 --> 04:27:58.996
EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY.

04:27:59.062 --> 04:28:01.064
ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE BAILEY IS

04:28:01.131 --> 04:28:03.200
STILL IS COMMON LAW AND WAS NOT

04:28:03.267 --> 04:28:05.569
REPEALED A STATUE THAT CODIFIES

04:28:05.636 --> 04:28:08.172
BAILEY IS NOT AN AMENDMENT TO

04:28:08.238 --> 04:28:09.339
PROP.

04:28:09.406 --> 04:28:09.973
FORTY SEVEN ADDITIONALLY

04:28:10.040 --> 04:28:11.241
COMMITTEE HAS RAISED CONCERNS

04:28:11.308 --> 04:28:13.577
AND STATED THAT IT IS UNCLEAR

04:28:13.644 --> 04:28:15.012
WHETHER THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL

04:28:15.078 --> 04:28:16.947
IS DECLARATORY OF THE EXISTING

04:28:17.014 --> 04:28:18.115
LAW BECAUSE THERE ARE.

04:28:18.182 --> 04:28:19.883
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CASES THAT

04:28:19.950 --> 04:28:22.152
PROVIDE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

04:28:22.219 --> 04:28:23.787
ON THE STATE OF THE CASE LAW.

04:28:23.854 --> 04:28:25.622
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

04:28:25.689 --> 04:28:27.858
NONE OF THE CASES CITED OVERRULE

04:28:27.925 --> 04:28:28.992
BAILEY.

04:28:29.059 --> 04:28:30.727
OR COLUMBIA.

04:28:30.794 --> 04:28:32.229
THESE TWO CASES ARE STILL VALID

04:28:32.296 --> 04:28:34.998
CASE LAW AS SUCH I BELIEVE IT IS

04:28:35.065 --> 04:28:37.067
ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO CODIFY

04:28:37.134 --> 04:28:40.504
THESE CASES VIA AB SEVENTEEN

04:28:40.571 --> 04:28:41.572
SEVENTY TWO AND PROVIDE CLARITY

04:28:41.638 --> 04:28:43.173
TO THE STATUE.

04:28:43.240 --> 04:28:44.141
IN FACT.

CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ALSO

04:28:49.279 --> 04:28:52.015
STATED IN ITS CONCURRENT OPINION.

04:28:52.082 --> 04:28:53.750
QUOTE IF THE DEFENDANT HAS

04:28:53.817 --> 04:28:55.853

WOULD ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO

04:31:36.480 --> 04:31:38.982
AGGREGATE SMALL A SEPARATE PETTY

04:31:39.049 --> 04:31:40.917
STEP SO THEY CAN CHARGE FELONY

04:31:40.984 --> 04:31:42.653
GRAND UP.

04:31:42.719 --> 04:31:45.222
THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE TWICE

04:31:45.288 --> 04:31:47.758
SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT -- AND

04:31:47.824 --> 04:31:49.226
PROP FORTY SEVEN WHICH WAS

04:31:49.292 --> 04:31:52.162
PASSED ON NOVEMBER FOURTH OF

04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:54.564

THE LEGISLATURE IS REQUIRED --

04:32:15.819 --> 04:32:19.156
WE BELIEVE THAT AB SEVENTEEN

04:32:19.222 --> 04:32:20.390
SEVENTY TWO TWICE TO AVOID THIS

04:32:20.457 --> 04:32:22.059
REQUIREMENT BY STATING THAT IS

04:32:22.125 --> 04:32:23.827
DECLARATORY.

04:32:23.894 --> 04:32:26.296
OF EXISTING LAW AND THE CASE

04:32:26.363 --> 04:32:28.832
THAT THEY WERE RELYING ON PEOPLE

04:32:28.899 --> 04:32:31.535
V. WITH MERCK -- BACK CASE

ON JULY TWENTY FOURTH OF TWENTY

04:32:37.674 --> 04:32:39.543
FOURTEEN SO IT WAS DECIDED IN

04:32:39.609 --> 04:32:41.044
JULY.

04:32:41.111 --> 04:32:43.280

04:32:54.658 --> 04:32:55.559
SIXTY THREE IT'S NOT REALLY

04:33:02.032 --> 04:33:02.766
PROP FORTY SOMEONE MADE IT CLEAR

04:33:02.833 --> 04:33:04.668
THAT A THEFT OF LESS THAN NINE

04:33:04.735 --> 04:33:05.635
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SHOULD

04:33:05.702 --> 04:33:07.971
BE TREATED AS PETTY THEFT AND

04:33:08.038 --> 04:33:08.438

BROADLY CONSTRUED TO ACCOMPLISH

04:33:17.814 --> 04:33:19.282
THAT PURPOSE AND THAT ONE OF THE

04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:21.418
PURPOSES WAS TO REQUIRE

04:33:21.485 --> 04:33:22.652
MISDEMEANORS.

04:33:22.719 --> 04:33:24.888
INSTEAD OF FELONIES FOR NON

04:33:24.955 --> 04:33:26.456

THAT IF THIS IS A PROBLEM THIS

04:34:13.203 --> 04:34:14.371
IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A

TO LESS RECIDIVISM IT WILL ONLY

04:35:58.275 --> 04:35:59.542

04:37:00.136 --> 04:37:02.238
CALL -- AFTER THE PASSAGE OF

04:37:02.305 --> 04:37:06.409
PROP FORTY SEVEN WHERE -- SHOP

04:37:06.476 --> 04:37:07.844
OWNERS WOULD KHôNG COMPLAINT.

04:37:07.911 --> 04:37:10.113
AND THE POLICE BASICALLY JUST

04:37:10.180 --> 04:37:11.181
TOLD HANDS UP AND SAID YOU KNOW

04:37:11.247 --> 04:37:12.882
THAT IF IT IS A IT IS A PETTY

04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:18.154
THEFT AND AND IS UNDER NINE

04:37:18.221 --> 04:37:18.722
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IS

04:37:18.788 --> 04:37:20.790
NOTHING WE CAN DO -- NOW TO SOME

04:37:20.857 --> 04:37:22.192
PEOPLE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY

04:37:22.258 --> 04:37:24.127
DOLLARS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY.

04:37:24.194 --> 04:37:25.996
FOR A SMALL SHOP OWNER -- IT IS

04:37:26.062 --> 04:37:28.598
AND AND AND AND AND I I DISAGREE

04:37:28.665 --> 04:37:31.067
WITH THE PREMISE THAT THAT --

04:37:31.134 --> 04:37:32.802
PETTY THEFT IS BASED ON POVERTY

04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:34.704
BECAUSE HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU

04:37:34.771 --> 04:37:36.039
DEFINE THAT.

04:37:36.106 --> 04:37:38.475
IS ONE THING. TO STEAL FOOD TO

04:37:38.541 --> 04:37:40.276
FEED YOUR YOUNG CHILDREN IS

04:37:40.343 --> 04:37:42.979
NOTHING TO GO TO WALMART OR LIKE

04:37:43.046 --> 04:37:45.682
A STORE AND RUN OUT WITH -- TWO

04:37:45.749 --> 04:37:48.685
BOTTLES OF JACK DANIEL'S.

04:37:48.752 --> 04:37:50.086
AS LONG AS UNDER HUNT NINE

04:37:50.153 --> 04:37:50.887
HUNDRED FIFTY BUCKS.

04:37:50.954 --> 04:37:52.389
I DON'T THINK THAT'S STEALING

04:37:52.455 --> 04:37:54.691
FOR POVERTY IS USED TO STEALING

04:37:54.758 --> 04:37:57.060
BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVE A SICKNESS.

04:37:57.127 --> 04:37:58.828
AND I'D SIT SO I THINK THAT IF

04:37:58.895 --> 04:38:02.098
WE CAN WE SHOULD AT LEAST GIVE.

04:38:02.165 --> 04:38:04.000
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT -- SOME

04:38:04.067 --> 04:38:07.037
MEANS OF PROTECTING SMALL

04:38:07.103 --> 04:38:08.071
BUSINESS OWNERS IN THEIR

04:38:08.138 --> 04:38:12.609
COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE WHO.

04:38:12.675 --> 04:38:15.578
WILL MAKE OR BREAK THEIR THEIR

04:38:15.645 --> 04:38:17.080
THEIR PAYROLL THAT MONTH

04:38:17.147 --> 04:38:18.281
SOMETIME BASED ON JUST NINE

04:38:18.348 --> 04:38:20.817
HUNDRED BUCKS AND AND AND YES I

04:38:20.884 --> 04:38:23.820
KNOW THAT THE CHAIR.

04:38:23.887 --> 04:38:26.322
HAD A TRY TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM

04:38:26.389 --> 04:38:26.890
THROUGH EIGHT AND ORGANIZED

04:38:26.956 --> 04:38:27.390
CRIME.

04:38:27.457 --> 04:38:28.024
BUT ORGANIZED CRIME COULD MEAN

04:38:28.091 --> 04:38:29.959
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ONE

04:38:30.026 --> 04:38:32.262
PERSON IF IF THAT IF THAT

04:38:32.328 --> 04:38:34.297
CRIMINAL IS SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH

04:38:34.364 --> 04:38:35.398
TO KNOW THAT OKAY.

04:38:35.465 --> 04:38:36.433
I JUST NEED TO HIT A DIFFERENT

04:38:36.499 --> 04:38:39.335
STORE EVERY DAY AND AND STATE

04:38:39.402 --> 04:38:40.737
UNDER NINE HUNDRED BUCKS

04:38:40.804 --> 04:38:41.037
[inaudible]

04:38:41.104 --> 04:38:42.639
I'M KINDA.

STORES THAT WE KNOW ALSO IN MY

04:39:14.471 --> 04:39:15.672
COMMUNITY IS A LARGE ISSUE

04:39:15.738 --> 04:39:17.674
HITTING MULTIPLE STORES UNDER

04:39:17.740 --> 04:39:18.641
NINE HUNDRED NOW.

04:39:18.708 --> 04:39:20.110
YOU CAN CHARGE THIS WAY.

04:39:20.176 --> 04:39:21.444
A SPECIFIC PROBLEM WAS BROUGHT

04:39:21.511 --> 04:39:22.879
TO US WE ADDRESSED IT AND NOW

04:39:22.946 --> 04:39:24.280
THAT IS.

04:39:24.347 --> 04:39:26.916
NO LONGER AN ISSUE -- SO THIS IS

04:39:26.983 --> 04:39:29.319
TRYING TO BROADEN THAT AS I

04:39:29.385 --> 04:39:31.221
UNDERSTAND IT NOW WHEN I READ.

04:39:31.287 --> 04:39:33.056
BAILEY IN BAILEY SHE HAD ONE

04:39:33.123 --> 04:39:34.891

ACTED THEN BROUGHT IN SEVERAL

04:39:37.093 --> 04:39:39.295
FUNDS RATE THAT FEELS DISTINCT

04:39:39.362 --> 04:39:40.130
TO ME FROM WHAT WE'RE TALKING

04:39:40.196 --> 04:39:41.531
ABOUT HERE TODAY WHICH IS

04:39:41.598 --> 04:39:42.899
MULTIPLE ACTS.

04:39:42.966 --> 04:39:45.135
THAT ARE DISTINCT AND IN THE LOT

04:39:45.201 --> 04:39:48.838
INTENTION IMPULSE IN PLAN FEELS.

04:39:48.905 --> 04:39:50.306
VAGUE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I

I WANT TO EAT AND SO I STEAL

04:39:56.412 --> 04:39:56.613
OVER YOU.

04:39:56.679 --> 04:39:57.213
ARE SIR WHAT IT RATING HOW ARE

04:39:57.280 --> 04:39:58.515
WE DEFINING THIS SUCH THAT IT'S

04:39:58.581 --> 04:40:01.851
CLEAR THAT IT WAS IN THE WAY

04:40:01.918 --> 04:40:03.453
THAT THE CHAIRS BILL.

04:40:03.520 --> 04:40:04.521
AGGREGATED A VERY CLEAR

04:40:04.587 --> 04:40:06.089
SITUATION WHERE IT WAS AN

04:40:06.156 --> 04:40:07.390
ORGANIZED CRIME RING WE'RE

04:40:07.457 --> 04:40:08.925
TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM

04:40:08.992 --> 04:40:09.826
THIS FEELS LIKE IT CAN BE

04:40:09.893 --> 04:40:11.761
BROADENED IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU

04:40:11.828 --> 04:40:13.129
HAVE CRIMES COMMITTED.

04:40:13.196 --> 04:40:15.431
OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME THAT

04:40:15.498 --> 04:40:18.168
ARE ALL PETTY THEFT AND NOW WE

04:40:18.234 --> 04:40:19.369
HAVE THE ABILITY TO AGGREGATE.

04:40:19.435 --> 04:40:20.904
ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION

04:40:20.970 --> 04:40:23.039
AND I THINK -- THE DISTINCTION

04:40:23.106 --> 04:40:24.340
IS THAT THE CHAIRS BILL FROM

04:40:24.407 --> 04:40:26.876
LAST YEAR BASICALLY TARGETED OUR

04:40:26.943 --> 04:40:28.178
RETAILERS FOR EXAMPLE

04:40:28.244 --> 04:40:30.947
SHOPLIFTING AT THE RETAIL STORES

04:40:31.014 --> 04:40:32.682
AND MARSHALL SETTINGS WILD ON

04:40:32.749 --> 04:40:33.650
THE OTHER HAND THIS PARTICULAR

04:40:33.716 --> 04:40:36.085
BILL DEALS WITH RESIDENTIAL.

04:40:36.152 --> 04:40:38.421
ALL PROPERTY CRIME FOR EXAMPLE

04:40:38.488 --> 04:40:40.857
SO THEY EACH ACTUALLY COMPLEMENT

04:40:40.924 --> 04:40:43.259
THE OTHER ARE FROM THAT ANGLE

04:40:43.326 --> 04:40:45.161
NOW AS TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

04:40:45.228 --> 04:40:47.463
THE DEFINITION OF ONE IMPOSE ONE

04:40:47.530 --> 04:40:48.097
INTENTION.

04:40:48.164 --> 04:40:50.400
THAT IS GIVEN AS A JURY

04:40:50.466 --> 04:40:53.236
INSTRUCTION BY THE JUDGE AND DOT

04:40:53.303 --> 04:40:55.305
PARTICULARLY -- COULD IN FACT BE

04:40:55.371 --> 04:40:57.040
PARTED DID THE LAW AS WELL WE'RE

04:40:57.106 --> 04:40:58.575
NOT TRYING TO EXPAND THE LAW IN

04:40:58.641 --> 04:41:00.677
ANYWAYS WE ARE JUST SIMPLY

04:41:00.743 --> 04:41:03.513
TRYING TO CODIFY THE TWO CASES.

04:41:03.580 --> 04:41:05.481
THAT ARE STILL GOOD LAW AND I

04:41:05.548 --> 04:41:06.583
HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING THAT

04:41:06.649 --> 04:41:08.718
SAYS THAT THESE TWO CASES HAVE

04:41:08.785 --> 04:41:11.688
BEEN OVERRULE THE PRIMARILY OFF

04:41:11.754 --> 04:41:13.456
PRIMARILY ARGUMENT RAISED BY THE

04:41:13.523 --> 04:41:16.693
OPPOSITION IS AT ALL I AM TRYING.

04:41:16.759 --> 04:41:18.394
TO A BASICALLY -- ACTED.

04:41:18.461 --> 04:41:20.496
AGAINST TO WILL OF THE VOTERS

04:41:20.563 --> 04:41:22.465
BUT WE'RE NOT AMENDING PROP

04:41:22.532 --> 04:41:23.733
FORTY SEVEN WHATSOEVER AND I

04:41:23.800 --> 04:41:24.601
THINK THAT IS TO FIND THE

04:41:24.667 --> 04:41:26.569
STATION AND THAT'S THE REASON

04:41:26.636 --> 04:41:27.604
WHY LET'S COUNCIL IS HERE AS

04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.971
WELL.

04:41:28.037 --> 04:41:29.672
I HAVE YET TO SEE ANY LANGUAGE

04:41:29.739 --> 04:41:32.141
IN ANY CASE OR EITHER IN CASE

04:41:32.208 --> 04:41:35.411
LAW OR IN PROPOSITION FOR FORTY

04:41:35.478 --> 04:41:37.847
SEVEN THAT SPECIFICALLY OVERRULE

04:41:37.914 --> 04:41:39.649
ALL BAILEY OR A COLUMBIA

04:41:39.716 --> 04:41:41.584
RESEARCH CORPORATION.

04:41:41.651 --> 04:41:43.052
SO YOU KNOW THE THE LAW IS STILL

04:41:43.119 --> 04:41:44.721
GOOD I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

04:41:44.787 --> 04:41:48.358
ATTEMPTING TO AMEND PROP FORTY

04:41:48.424 --> 04:41:49.192
SEVEN EIGHT I THINK I INVITE THE

04:41:49.259 --> 04:41:50.760
CHAIR TO MAYBE INVITE THE

04:41:50.827 --> 04:41:51.361
OUTLETS COUNCIL COME UP TO

04:41:51.427 --> 04:41:52.528

IF YOU SO DESIRE.

04:41:53.863 --> 04:41:55.665
AND I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK WE

04:41:55.732 --> 04:41:57.700
ARE SIMPLY SAYING THAT IS WHAT

04:41:57.767 --> 04:41:59.836
THE LAW CURRENTLY IS WHAT TRYING

04:41:59.902 --> 04:42:02.171
TO CODIFY THAT THOSE WHO CASES

04:42:02.238 --> 04:42:04.007
TO ALLOW THE PROSECUTORS THE

04:42:04.073 --> 04:42:06.643
ADDITIONAL ABILITY TO AGGREGATE.

04:42:06.709 --> 04:42:09.345
ARE ALL THE CELEBRITY CRIMES AND

04:42:09.412 --> 04:42:11.014
IT'S NOT THAT ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE

04:42:11.080 --> 04:42:12.181
NOT INVENTING NEW LAW WOULD NOT

04:42:12.248 --> 04:42:14.484
EXPANDING UPON PROP FORTY SEVEN

04:42:14.550 --> 04:42:15.685
OR THE CHAIRS LAW LAST YEAR.

04:42:15.752 --> 04:42:23.259
BECAUSE HIS BASICALLY DEALT WITH

04:42:23.326 --> 04:42:25.094
THE COMMERCIAL CITING

04:42:25.161 --> 04:42:25.395

JUST SO I GUESS I'M I'M LOOKING

04:42:32.068 --> 04:42:32.635
AT THE LAW AND I DON'T SEE IT AS

04:42:32.702 --> 04:42:33.803
IT APPLIES ONLY TO RESIDENTIAL

04:42:33.870 --> 04:42:35.438
SETTINGS AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS

04:42:35.505 --> 04:42:39.342
THAT YOUR INTENTION IS AN ACTOR

04:42:39.409 --> 04:42:39.742
THAT IS IN THERE.

04:42:39.809 --> 04:42:40.243
RIGHT.

04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:41.811
YES THAT THAT IS THE INTENTION

04:42:41.878 --> 04:42:42.879
OF BECAUSE AS FAR AS THE

04:42:42.945 --> 04:42:44.147
COMMERCIAL SETTING DOT SHOULD BE

CAPTURE ALL BY THE CHAIRS UP LAW

04:42:46.282 --> 04:42:48.418

OKAY SO IT'S ALL SETTINGS

04:42:49.185 --> 04:42:50.953
BESIDES COMMERCIAL I GUESS WOULD

LET'S KELSO IS THAT THEY REALLY

04:42:54.524 --> 04:42:56.392

04:42:56.459 --> 04:42:56.626
ANOTHER.

04:42:56.693 --> 04:42:58.428
