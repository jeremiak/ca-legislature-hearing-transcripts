00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:52.804
ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW TO DO THAT

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.406
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE IS

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:55.774
THERE IS A CURRENT BILL RIGHT

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:57.409

RESEARCH AS WELL ABOUT WHAT IS

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:22.167

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:32.444
THAT WE NEED TO- LEVERAGE AND

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:34.279

RESPONDING TO A DISASTER THE

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:43.021
PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY IN BEING

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:45.190

CASE WHERE WERE WERE WORK

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:55.567
ENTERING IT THAT'S WHY THE

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:57.035
LEAST THOSE PROGRAM IS SO

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.471
IMPORTANT. ON THE FRONT AND- IN

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:01.139
BEGIN BUILDING THAT BASS LINE

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:03.308
THAT FOUNDATION. OF BROADBAND

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:05.177
THAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO THE

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:08.313

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.015
MAKE SURE THAT NO COMMUNITY NO

00:24:10.081 --> 00:24:12.851

AFRAID TO BE ABLE TO GET

00:24:21.893 --> 00:24:23.461

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:24.796
THROUGH ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:26.531

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:07.438
PREPARATION. SO SIR I DON'T

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:08.939

AN AREA WHERE THERE'S GONNA BE

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:20.350
SOME CITIES THAT. YOU KNOW

00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:21.552
WE'RE GONNA WANT TO FOCUS ON

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:22.719
CITIES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT

00:45:22.786 --> 00:45:25.889
UNDERSERVED AND UP AB LAST

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:28.525
RESOURCE. THERE MAY BE OTHER

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:30.627
CITIES THERE IS FAR AS HOW MUCH

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:32.196

THREE OR FOUR CITIES THAT ARE

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:39.970
VERY SMALL RIGHT NEXT TO EACH

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:41.438
OTHER AS THEY CONSENTED TRIES

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:43.240
THAT WE KNOW THAT AS A AS AN

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:44.975
INDIVIDUAL CITY. THEY DON'T

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.844
HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT IF THE

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.212
IF THEY CAN MATCH THAT THEY CAN

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:50.514
COMBINE. THE THREE CITIES THAT

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.381
ARE NEXT TO EACH AYE I THINK

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:52.649
ABOUT THE PENINSULA SAN

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:54.251

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:56.120
MATTEO COUNTY. WE'VE GOT YOU

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:57.588
KNOW MULTIPLE SMALL COMMUNITIES

00:45:57.654 --> 00:45:59.490
ARE DOWN ALONG. THE PACIFIC

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:01.425
COAST HIGHWAY LOS ANGELES WE'VE

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:02.826
GOT THE SMALLER CITIES THAT

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:04.828
COULD COME TOGETHER AND COMBINE

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:06.597
RESOURCES AND WE CAN PROVIDE

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:09.366
GRANTS TO HELP AMPLIFY. THAT

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:11.235
AFTER A GET THEM STARTED SO I

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.803
THINK THE ANSWER IS WE'RE NOT.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.271
THAT'S NOT FULLY VETTED OUT

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:16.373
YET- AND YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.674
THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:19.309
I JUST KNOW THAT FROM.

00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:21.245
DEVELOPING SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:23.113
THE PAST OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOT

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.382
ENOUGH MONEY TO GO AROUND TO

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:26.650
REALLY GET EVERYBODY WHAT WE

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:29.419
NEED TO BUT THERE'S A WAY TO-

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:31.622
LEVERAGE UP VARIOUS SOURCES OF

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.993
BASELINE LEVEL OF METRIC. ENJOY

PROJECT THAT'S RIGHT SO I

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:39.096
ASSUMED IT YOU COULD PROBABLY

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:39.730
CREATE A MATRIX THAT

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:42.432
IDENTIFIES. CITIES BY TYPES OF

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:43.534

NEED- AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:47.237
WOULD BE SUCH A I THINK IT

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:47.804
WOULD IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:49.940
THAT WOULD BE WORTH DOING- WITH

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:51.508

THE BACKLOGS AND HOW AND HOW

00:59:54.857 --> 01:00:01.230
THE PROVIDED FUNDING WOULD. BE

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.266
ALLOCATED AND USE. I'M TO ISSUE

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.467
TO THE FINANCE ITEM OR YOUR

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.969
REGION- WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:06.736
WE KERN DON'T HAVE THE TRUE

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.204

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.073
TIME AT THIS TIME WE DO FIND

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.374

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.376
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS IT

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:14.844
WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO LOWER

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.679
INCOME INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.548
THERE ARE SOME KEY QUESTIONS

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.683
THAT REMAIN AND THOSE INCLUDE

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.251
WHAT HAPPENS OF THE PARTITION

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:24.287
PARTICIPATION RATE IS HIGHER

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.588
THAN EXPECTED RESULTING IN A

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:27.090
LARGER REDUCTION IN FINANCE THE

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:28.024
REVENUE THAN IS CURRENTLY

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:30.626

DISTRIBUTED AND HOW THE PROGRAM

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.803
OPERATES IN TANDEM WITH THE

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.972
GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL TO

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:44.841

TO PAY DETERMINATION STATEWIDE.

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:49.679
AND THE ANSWERS TO THESE

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.614
QUESTIONS ARE CRITICAL TO ALLOW

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:52.949
THE LEGISLATURE TO WEIGH THE

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:53.750

PRIORITIES AND EXPECTATIONS.

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.292
AND SO FINALLY ON THIS ITEM WE

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:04.660
WILL NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.229

SUPPORTED BY THIS TYPE OF

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.735

BAIL AND GIVEN A RECENT COURT

MADE BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

APPLY BY THE TRIAL COURTS BUT

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:50.973
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WOULD BE

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:51.606
THE ONE WHO WOULD BE ALLOCATING

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:55.210

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:18.273
FUNDING TO AND WHAT POINT. DO

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.275
YOU TREAT THAT DATA IS

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:22.611
UNCOLLECTIBLE- IF AT ALL. IF

01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:23.545

BUSINESSES EMPLOY YOU YOU CAN

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:29.217
CALL THAT I COLLECTED THAT- SO

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:30.952
HOW DO WE LOOK AT THAT. EARLIER

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:32.687
THAN SAY TWENTY FIFTEEN. IS IT

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:34.089
STILL PRESUME THAT IT'S

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:35.824
COLLECTIBLE AND TO PEOPLE STILL

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.425
MAKE BUDGET PLANS AGAINST IT.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:38.526
OR DOES IT GET USED AGAINST

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:45.634
THEM. YEAH I MEAN IT'S A GIVEN.

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.202
DEFER TO MY COLLEGE EDUCATION

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:49.137
COUNCIL FOR ON THE SPECIFICS

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.639
AS- AS FAR AS WHAT WOULD BE

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:52.474
CONSIDERED COLLECTIBLE ON PRIOR

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.543
TO THAT DATE. IT IS LIKE A

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:56.578
DIRECTION THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.947
AGAIN- IT IS UP TO EACH

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.749
INDIVIDUAL COUNTY AND PROGRAM

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.584
TO DETERMINE COLLECTABILITY NON

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:05.120
COLLECTIBILITY- WE DO PROVIDE

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:07.622
GUIDELINES BUT THERE'S NOTHING-

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.291
SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF DURATION

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.626
AN AGENT THAT. YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.528
RIGHT THAT THE BUSINESSES TO

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:15.697
USE CERTAIN METRICS BETTER.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.431
THIS AGAIN THIS IS A LOCAL

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:19.000
DECISION. WE DO ENCOURAGE THEM

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:22.003
TO ASSESS THE H. COLLECTABILITY

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:24.139
THE DEBT. BUT IT IS A LOCAL

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:27.208
DETERMINATION. AND SO WE DEFER

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:28.176

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.780
COLLECTIBLE ARE NOT THAT CLOSE

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:32.614
IT WOULD BE SOME PORTION THAT

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:35.216
IS EFFECTIVELY NOT CLICKABLE

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:36.518

01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:38.920

AS ADDITIONAL COUNSEL TO THE

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:42.324

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.425
DECISION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:45.493
MAKE THAT PROCESS SO ISSUE I

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.261

SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:46.014
DONE STATEWIDE. I IMAGINE AGAIN

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.182
THE LANGUAGE HASN'T BEEN

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:48.149
FINALIZED YET BUT IN THE

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:49.317
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:50.218

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.021
ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL BE

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:53.588

IMPACTED BY THIS. ALL RELIEF

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:04.999
PROGRAM. BUT WE IMAGINE THAT-

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:06.668
IF YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.102
THE NUMBER OF CITATIONS THAT

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:09.504
HAVE BANNED- ISSUED IN

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:11.706

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:13.074
UNDER WHICH IS AVAILABLE AND

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:15.009
THEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.744
AGAIN IT'S BASED ON A LOT A LOT

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:18.379
ON ESTIMATIONS. THE NUMBER OF

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:19.447
PEOPLE THAT WE ANTICIPATE

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:20.715

THEIR ENTIRE FIND IN FEET-

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:25.220
THOSE WHO WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO

IT AND THEN AND THEN ULTIMATELY

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:28.089
THOSE WHO WILL QUALIFY BECAUSE

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:30.992
THEY DO- THEY DO WITH THAT

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:32.694
MEANS THAT THAT THE POVERTY

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:33.595
THRESHOLD THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:34.829
INCLUDED IN THE LEGISLATION WE

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.698
IMAGINE THAT WILL BE ABOUT

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:37.198
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:39.133

WE CONSIDER WHEN WHERE AND

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.771
WHERE I'M DOING THAT ANALYSIS

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.306
IS THAT BASED UPON SOME OF THE

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:46.474
DATA THAT WE'VE COLLECTED

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:47.809

TIME. BOTH THE NUMBER OF CASES

02:11:04.823 --> 02:11:07.292
THAT THAT THOSE- STAFF WILL BE

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:08.760
REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE PER

TIME WHEN. POPULATION WAS MUCH

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:34.152
HIGHER AND- THAN IT IS TODAY

02:11:34.219 --> 02:11:35.854
AND IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.956
FUTURE EASIER IT'S ALSO HAD

02:11:38.023 --> 02:11:38.991
SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:40.592
ESTIMATING THE TIME KERN

02:11:40.659 --> 02:11:45.163
MASTICATION IN FACT. IT REPORTS

02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:46.732

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:57.609
TIME BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR BUT

02:11:57.676 --> 02:11:59.344

ASSEMBLY WELL USED AFTER TIME-

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:11.623
PROTESTING. BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:14.660
HOW BY HOW MUCH ALSO CONNECTING

DEPARTMENT IS DOING FAST TIME

02:12:20.899 --> 02:12:22.434
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT IMPACT

02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:24.236
THAT WOULD HAVE- SO WE

INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. BUT WE

02:16:29.281 --> 02:16:31.883
RECOMMEND APPROVING BUDGET BILL

02:16:42.694 --> 02:16:44.195
STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE

02:16:44.262 --> 02:16:45.597
AND LESS THE DEPARTMENT PUTS

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:48.700

02:16:50.602 --> 02:16:51.937
AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS

02:16:52.804 --> 02:16:54.806
REALLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE

AS THIRTEEN BILLION JUST IN

TO BE SOME VERY TOUGH DECISIONS

02:17:09.554 --> 02:17:11.089
ABOUT WHERE TO SPEND THIS- THIS

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.290
HUNDRED MILLION- SO OUR

02:17:12.357 --> 02:17:14.059

02:42:15.058 --> 02:42:18.028
QUITE EXTRAORDINARY OF ONE OF

HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS I KNOW

02:42:32.209 --> 02:42:34.878
THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO-

02:42:34.945 --> 02:42:36.847
CREATE A MORE THERAPEUTIC.

02:42:36.913 --> 02:42:39.015

02:42:45.889 --> 02:42:47.824
WHAT I SAW. OVER THERE. THE

02:42:47.891 --> 02:42:51.061

OUT EVEN MORE THAN THE PHYSICAL

02:43:06.676 --> 02:43:09.079

02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:26.202
IT WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY

02:57:26.268 --> 02:57:28.070
TWELVE HOURS PER IN CORRIE WHAT

02:57:28.137 --> 02:57:29.538

02:57:31.507 --> 02:57:33.809
FIRST SIX MONTHS OR SO WAS IT

02:57:33.876 --> 02:57:35.678

EFFICIENCIES TO BE FOUND BUT

02:58:01.404 --> 02:58:04.540
JUST BASED ON THE NUMBERS OF

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE

02:58:24.060 --> 02:58:25.928

LATE TODAY THERE WAS A- ANOTHER

03:09:57.819 --> 03:09:59.154
OFFICIAL GOVERNMENTAL DUTY THAT

03:09:59.221 --> 03:10:00.589
I HAD THIS HAPPEN SOMETIMES

03:10:00.655 --> 03:10:02.491
WITH THE WITH COMMITTEE TIMING

03:10:02.557 --> 03:10:04.159

GLAD YOU JOINED- I HAVE ANOTHER

03:10:07.596 --> 03:10:10.832
QUESTION- RIGHT NOW WE DON'T.

03:10:10.899 --> 03:10:11.700
WE'RE NOT GETTING THE

03:10:11.767 --> 03:10:13.802
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE STATE

03:10:13.869 --> 03:10:15.871
COULD IMPROVE ITS GRANT RATES

03:10:15.937 --> 03:10:18.273
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT- WHETHER

03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:20.108
IT'S THE ENTRANCE INTENT IS TO

03:10:20.175 --> 03:10:22.210
ADDRESS THE BACKLOG INCREASED

03:10:22.277 --> 03:10:27.015
GRANT RATES OR BOTH OR NONE. SO

03:10:27.082 --> 03:10:29.785
CURRENTLY THE PROPOSAL IS-

03:10:29.851 --> 03:10:31.820
FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT

03:10:31.887 --> 03:10:32.954
WE'RE ABLE TO SCHEDULE AND

03:10:33.021 --> 03:10:35.590
CONDUCT ALL REQUIRED HEARINGS.

03:10:35.657 --> 03:10:38.260
AS FAR AS PURPOSE WE-

03:10:38.326 --> 03:10:39.895
ATTEMPTING TO INCREASE THE

03:10:39.961 --> 03:10:42.831
GRANT GRANTS. I'M CURRENTLY OUR

03:10:42.898 --> 03:10:45.133
STANDARD IS WHETHER OR NOT THE

03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:47.369
PERSON OPPOSES A CURRENT AND

03:10:47.435 --> 03:10:49.738
RESOURCE TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND

03:10:49.805 --> 03:10:52.207
WE USE EVIDENCE BASED-

03:10:52.274 --> 03:10:56.812
PROCESSES FOR THAT AND WE- WE

03:10:56.878 --> 03:10:57.846
USE A STRUCTURED DECISION

03:10:57.913 --> 03:10:59.548
MAKING FRAMEWORK TO ARRIVE AT

03:10:59.614 --> 03:11:02.584
THAT CONCLUSION. AND THERE IS

03:11:02.651 --> 03:11:04.719
THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES

03:11:04.786 --> 03:11:07.255
THAT GO INTO. PSYCHOLOGISTS

03:11:07.322 --> 03:11:12.627
THINK TRY. MY VIDEO STOPPED.

03:11:12.694 --> 03:11:17.065
STE STE. CAN YOU STILL HEAR ME

03:11:17.132 --> 03:11:20.569
YES. OKAY I APOLOGIZE MY I

03:11:20.635 --> 03:11:21.837
THINK MY VIDEO WILL GO BACK ON

03:11:21.903 --> 03:11:23.305
IN JUST A MOMENT SO I APOLOGIZE

03:11:23.371 --> 03:11:28.109
FOR NOT. THERE WE GO. I'M D.

03:11:28.176 --> 03:11:32.480
CONCERN IS REALLY HOW THEY'RE

03:11:32.547 --> 03:11:34.549
TWO DIFFERENT WAYS I SUPPOSE OF

03:11:34.616 --> 03:11:37.719
INCREASING GRANTS- ONE IS TO

03:11:37.786 --> 03:11:40.121
CHANGE THE STANDARD- BY WHICH

03:11:40.188 --> 03:11:42.057
WE DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY

03:11:42.123 --> 03:11:43.491
IS A CURRENT AND RESOURCE TO

03:11:43.558 --> 03:11:45.560
PUBLIC SAFETY HOWEVER I WOULD

03:11:45.627 --> 03:11:47.929
CAUTION THAT- BUT DIRECT

03:11:47.996 --> 03:11:49.698
RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD LIKELY

03:11:49.764 --> 03:11:51.333
BE AN INCREASING RECIDIVISM

03:11:51.399 --> 03:11:57.105
RATES. THE OTHER WAY OF. I HAVE

03:11:57.172 --> 03:12:00.141
TRYING TO INCREASE GRANT RATES

03:12:00.208 --> 03:12:02.110
WOULD BE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THE

03:12:02.177 --> 03:12:03.378
DEPARTMENT IS DOING RIGHT NOW

03:12:03.445 --> 03:12:05.881
WHICH IS TO EXPAND- THE

03:12:05.947 --> 03:12:07.382
COGNITIVE BASED INTERVENTION

03:12:07.449 --> 03:12:08.984
PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL

03:12:09.050 --> 03:12:12.020
PROGRAMS FOR REHABILITATION- TO

03:12:12.087 --> 03:12:13.755
AS MANY PARTICIPANTS ARE AS

03:12:13.822 --> 03:12:15.523
MANY PERSONS WHO ARE

03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:17.926
INCARCERATED AS POSSIBLE. I

03:12:17.993 --> 03:12:19.227
HOPE THAT HELPS ANSWER THE

03:12:19.294 --> 03:12:22.764
QUESTION. IT YES IT CLARIFIES

03:12:22.831 --> 03:12:27.802
IT- IT WAS MENTIONED I GUESS IT

03:12:27.869 --> 03:12:29.537
WAS EARLIER TODAY THAT THE

03:12:29.604 --> 03:12:37.245
RESPONSE FROM JUDGES. OF. THE

03:12:37.312 --> 03:12:38.647
NOTICES THAT WERE SENT OUT THE

03:12:38.713 --> 03:12:40.282
JUDGES AND THE RESPONSE WAS

03:12:40.348 --> 03:12:42.918
LIKE TWO HUNDRED IS THAT. TWO

03:12:42.984 --> 03:12:44.319
HUNDRED OUT OF THE ORDINARY

03:12:44.386 --> 03:12:45.553
BELIEVE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:46.922
FIVE THOUSAND. DO YOU HAVE ANY

03:12:46.988 --> 03:12:51.026
IDEA WHY THAT IS OR- WHAT CAN

03:12:51.092 --> 03:12:54.062
BE DONE THAT. SO A COUPLE OF

03:12:54.129 --> 03:12:57.732
THINGS ON THAT YES ONE IS. YOU

03:12:57.799 --> 03:12:59.134
KNOW WHEN THESE LAWS WERE

03:12:59.200 --> 03:13:02.170
WRITTEN- I'M JUST GUESSING

03:13:02.237 --> 03:13:04.906
THAT- TERMS OF INCARCERATION

03:13:04.973 --> 03:13:07.075
WERE MUCH SHORTER. SO

03:13:07.142 --> 03:13:09.978
CURRENTLY- THE MINIMUM AMOUNT

03:13:10.045 --> 03:13:11.379
OF TIME THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO

03:13:11.446 --> 03:13:14.049
SERVE PRIOR ON AVERAGE- PRIOR

03:13:14.115 --> 03:13:15.350
TO BEING ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE

03:13:15.417 --> 03:13:17.352
SUITABILITY HEARING IS FIFTEEN

03:13:17.419 --> 03:13:20.822
YEARS. SO THE LIKELIHOOD OF A

03:13:20.889 --> 03:13:21.957
JUDGE WHO WAS SITTING AT

03:13:22.023 --> 03:13:23.458
SENTENCING TO STILL BE ON THE

03:13:23.525 --> 03:13:26.161
BENCH I AM FIFTEEN YEARS LATER

03:13:26.227 --> 03:13:29.698
OR UPWARDS OF SOMETIMES TWENTY

03:13:29.764 --> 03:13:31.199
TWENTY FIVE YEARS THIRTY YEARS

03:13:31.266 --> 03:13:33.668
IS VERY UNLIKELY. SO I THINK

03:13:33.735 --> 03:13:35.303
THAT THAT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY

03:13:35.370 --> 03:13:36.638
SHIFTED SINCE THE LAW WAS PUT

03:13:36.705 --> 03:13:38.807
INTO A INTO A FACT THE OTHER

03:13:38.873 --> 03:13:41.209
THING IS THAT- OUT YOU KNOW

03:13:41.276 --> 03:13:43.011
THAT A LOT OF CASES THE

03:13:43.078 --> 03:13:44.579
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CASES

03:13:44.646 --> 03:13:46.581
ARE RESOLVED BY JURY ARE- BY

03:13:46.648 --> 03:13:49.217
PLEA AGREEMENT. SO INFORMATION

03:13:49.284 --> 03:13:52.520
THAT IS GAINED AT SENTENCING-

03:13:52.587 --> 03:13:54.823
MAY NOT BE REALLY ANYTHING

03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:58.093
MORE- MORE EXTENSIVE THAN WHAT

03:13:58.159 --> 03:13:59.227
WE GET FROM A PROBATION

03:13:59.294 --> 03:14:00.895
OFFICER'S REPORT OR THE LAW

03:14:00.962 --> 03:14:03.298
ENFORCEMENT REPORTS OR- THE

03:14:03.365 --> 03:14:05.500
FRANKLIN HEARING I DOCUMENTS IT

03:14:05.567 --> 03:14:07.902
RECEIVES FOR USE OF FIVE OR SO

03:14:07.969 --> 03:14:09.137
A LOT OF THE INFORMATION IS

03:14:09.204 --> 03:14:11.539
DUPLICATIVE. OF WHAT WE RECEIVE

03:14:11.606 --> 03:14:14.342
ANYWAY AND THEN LAST- ONE THING

03:14:14.409 --> 03:14:16.077
THAT HAS CHANGED IS OUR LEGAL

03:14:16.144 --> 03:14:19.214
STANDARD- PREVIOUSLY IT WAS

03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:20.548
PERMISSIBLE TO THE BOARD NOT

03:14:20.615 --> 03:14:23.151
TALKING A COUPLE DECADES AGO IT

03:14:23.218 --> 03:14:24.919
WAS PERMISSIBLE FOR THE BOARD

03:14:24.986 --> 03:14:26.788
TO DENY SOMEBODY POLL BASED ON

03:14:26.855 --> 03:14:28.757
THE SEVERITY OF THEIR OFFENSE.

03:14:28.823 --> 03:14:30.225
YOU CAN IMAGINE UNDER THAT PARA

03:14:30.291 --> 03:14:32.961
DYING THAT THE SEVERITY FACTS

03:14:33.028 --> 03:14:34.329
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEVERITY OF

03:14:34.396 --> 03:14:36.364
THE OFFENSE WOULD BE VERY

03:14:36.431 --> 03:14:37.966
SIGNIFICANT FOR THE BOARD TO

03:14:38.033 --> 03:14:40.502
CONSIDER. NOW IN THE WAKE OF

03:14:40.568 --> 03:14:42.704
SIGNIFICANT- LET LET JUST

03:14:42.771 --> 03:14:44.172
MEDICATION AND SOME

03:14:44.239 --> 03:14:46.908
LEGISLATION- OUR STANDARD IS

03:14:46.975 --> 03:14:48.309
WHETHER THE PERSON POSES A

03:14:48.376 --> 03:14:51.112
CURRENT AND REGIONAL RISK TODAY

03:14:51.179 --> 03:14:52.280
AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY

03:14:52.347 --> 03:14:53.281
LOOKING AT IS WHO IS THE PERSON

03:14:53.348 --> 03:14:58.753
TODAY YES WHO WERE THEY WERE.

03:14:58.820 --> 03:14:59.287
BACK THEN BUT WHO ARE THEY

03:14:59.354 --> 03:15:00.622
TODAY AND HOW THEY CHANGED. AND

03:15:00.688 --> 03:15:01.322
SO THE- OF OUR HERE HAS ALL

03:15:01.389 --> 03:15:04.626
CHIU SIGNIFICANTLY SO I'M NOT-

03:15:04.692 --> 03:15:06.061
AT I DON'T MEAN TO BE

03:15:06.127 --> 03:15:07.662
DISRESPECTFUL TO THE JUDICIARY

03:15:07.729 --> 03:15:09.097
OR ANYBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE

03:15:09.164 --> 03:15:10.198
GOVERNED THE SENTENCING

03:15:10.265 --> 03:15:12.767
HEARING- TWO DECADES AGO. BUT

03:15:12.834 --> 03:15:14.736
CHANCES ARE THE FOCUS OF OUR

03:15:14.803 --> 03:15:16.471
HEARING IS NOT GOING TO BE THE

03:15:16.538 --> 03:15:19.140
INFORMATION THAT A JUDGE WOULD

03:15:19.207 --> 03:15:20.875
HAVE FROM TWENTY YEARS PRIOR I

03:15:20.942 --> 03:15:22.844
HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE YES.

03:15:22.911 --> 03:15:28.716
CERTAINLY OKAY- SENATOR NEWMAN

I ITEM QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY

03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:38.093
AROUND TIME I THINK IT'S ITEM

03:15:38.159 --> 03:15:40.095
ELEVEN- MAYBE IT OVERLAPS WITH

03:15:40.161 --> 03:15:42.263
I'M SIXTEEN WHICH IS

03:15:42.330 --> 03:15:44.966
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE- THE

03:15:45.033 --> 03:15:47.035
HEAD COUNT FOR THE P. I. P.

03:15:47.102 --> 03:15:49.804
SECTION OF THE B. C. P. AND SO

03:15:49.871 --> 03:15:51.773
I GUESS MY QUESTIONS PROBABLY

03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:54.375
STARTING WITH MISTER SWANSON I

03:15:54.442 --> 03:15:58.079
THINK- AND SPECIFICALLY. AS YOU

03:15:58.146 --> 03:15:59.214
LOOK THROUGH THE B. C. P.

03:15:59.280 --> 03:16:00.949
EITHER THERE THERE ARE SOME

03:16:01.015 --> 03:16:03.818
SLIGHT CHANGES IN HEAD COUNT-

03:16:03.885 --> 03:16:05.153
YOU KNOW MOSTLY MINOR BUT WHEN

03:16:05.220 --> 03:16:06.921
YOU GET TO THE PSYCH TECH

03:16:06.988 --> 03:16:08.790
SECTION- THERE'S A VERY LARGE

03:16:08.857 --> 03:16:11.726
DECREASE IN HEADCOUNT FOR FOUR

03:16:11.793 --> 03:16:13.294
OH FIVE TWO TWO HUNDRED TEN. SO

03:16:13.361 --> 03:16:16.030
IF YOU COULD GIVE US LIFTED

03:16:16.097 --> 03:16:17.999
LITTLE INSIGHT AS TO WHY. GOOD

03:16:18.066 --> 03:16:21.603
AFTERNOON. OKAY WHEN. OKAY GOOD

03:16:21.669 --> 03:16:23.838
AFTERNOON- THIS DOING READER

03:16:23.905 --> 03:16:26.875
AGAIN DEBBIE DIRECTOR- YOU KNOW

03:16:26.941 --> 03:16:29.210
THE SHIFTING AND RESOURCES

03:16:29.277 --> 03:16:34.849
FROM- PSYCH TECHS. AFTER

03:16:34.916 --> 03:16:37.485
MARKERS- TO THE BASELINE

03:16:37.552 --> 03:16:39.320
OPERATIONS OUT THERE. ONE OF

03:16:39.387 --> 03:16:42.657
THE THINGS- THAT WAS ADDED INTO

03:16:42.724 --> 03:16:44.692
C. H. YOU HAVE WAS- SOME

03:16:44.759 --> 03:16:46.528
CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS TO

03:16:46.594 --> 03:16:49.230
TAKE ON SOME OF THAT WORK LOAD-

03:16:49.297 --> 03:16:51.566
THEY ALSO HAD- SOME PEACH SHE'S

03:16:51.633 --> 03:16:54.502
DOING SOME ESCORT WORK- WHICH

03:16:54.569 --> 03:16:55.670
WE'VE REPLACED WITH CUSTODY

03:16:55.737 --> 03:16:57.205
OFFICERS- WHICH IS MORE

03:16:57.272 --> 03:16:59.641
APPROPRIATE. AND WE'VE ALSO

03:16:59.707 --> 03:17:01.709
ENHANCED OUR IN STAFFING SO

03:17:01.776 --> 03:17:03.378
WE'VE INCREASED- THE R. ENDS

03:17:03.444 --> 03:17:05.413
OUT THERE AS WELL- BUT

03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:07.615
BASICALLY IT COMES DOWN. TO THE

03:17:07.682 --> 03:17:09.117
MODELING AND THEN WORKING WITH

03:17:09.184 --> 03:17:11.319
THE INSTITUTION- TO DETERMINE.

03:17:11.386 --> 03:17:12.820
WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT THEIR

03:17:12.887 --> 03:17:15.023
NEEDS- AND MEET THEIR PATIENT

03:17:15.089 --> 03:17:18.293
NEEDS- FOR THAT POPULATION- WE

03:17:18.359 --> 03:17:19.894
REALIZE THAT IT IS. A PRETTY

03:17:19.961 --> 03:17:22.030
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION- BUT

03:17:22.096 --> 03:17:24.199
WE'VE COUNTERED THAT WITH-

03:17:24.265 --> 03:17:25.767
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IN OTHER

03:17:25.833 --> 03:17:28.903
CLASSIFICATIONS- THAT ARE MORE

03:17:28.970 --> 03:17:29.604
APPROPRIATE FOR SOME OF THAT

03:17:29.671 --> 03:17:31.206
WORKLOAD. SHOWS MY

03:17:31.272 --> 03:17:32.307
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE ARE

03:17:32.373 --> 03:17:33.441
SUBJECTS THAT ARE ALL THE

03:17:33.508 --> 03:17:35.210
REPRESENTED THROUGH COLLECTIVE

03:17:35.276 --> 03:17:40.481
BARGAINING. I AND. THAT DURING

03:17:40.548 --> 03:17:42.350
THE- YEAH THEY THEY KNOW WORK

03:17:42.417 --> 03:17:44.052
WITH WORKING OVERTIME EVEN AS

03:17:44.118 --> 03:17:45.887
THEY TOOK PERCENT PAY CUTS. SO

03:17:45.954 --> 03:17:47.522
THIS SEEMS LIKE A EXT. SHE FROM

03:17:47.589 --> 03:17:49.757
THE POINT OF VIEW OF THAT- TO

03:17:49.824 --> 03:17:51.125
ALMOST WRITTEN REDUCE IT BY

03:17:51.192 --> 03:17:54.662
HALF- INITIAL EIGHT EMPLOYED BY

03:17:54.729 --> 03:17:55.530
THE LOT WHERE THE WHERE THOSE

03:17:55.597 --> 03:17:59.067
POSITIONS LOCATED. BOTH THE

03:17:59.133 --> 03:18:00.835
BALL OF THOSE POSITIONS LOCATED

03:18:00.902 --> 03:18:03.438
EACH YEAR INSP. AT THE HEALTH

03:18:03.504 --> 03:18:09.110
FACILITY. AND SO. MANY IF

03:18:09.177 --> 03:18:12.180
PRINCE THERE. BUT WE CAN THE

03:18:12.247 --> 03:18:14.849
WORK WAS NEW DURING THE PANTO-

03:18:14.916 --> 03:18:16.284
AGAIN SEEMS REALLY DRASTIC TO

03:18:16.351 --> 03:18:22.156
REDO THAT WORK BY. AND SO- I

03:18:22.223 --> 03:18:22.790
MEAN I GUESS YOU'VE COME. ON IT

03:18:22.857 --> 03:18:25.293

03:24:13.841 --> 03:24:15.476
HAVE FOR INCREASE AND

03:24:15.543 --> 03:24:17.845
RECIDIVISM RATES ARE CURRENT

03:24:17.912 --> 03:24:19.714
RECIDIVISM RATE USING THE

03:24:19.780 --> 03:24:21.515
STANDARD THAT WE USE NOW IS AS

03:24:21.582 --> 03:24:27.288
I SAID GENERAL RECIDIVISM IT'S-

03:24:27.355 --> 03:24:29.223
TWO TO FIVE. OR PERSONS RE-

03:24:29.290 --> 03:24:30.424
HAVE A NEW CAN WITHIN THREE

03:24:30.491 --> 03:24:34.462
YEARS AND WHICH LESS THAN 1%

03:24:34.528 --> 03:24:37.932
HAVE A NEW CONVICTION FOR A-

03:24:37.999 --> 03:24:39.634
WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A

03:24:39.700 --> 03:24:41.135
VIOLIN THE FLUTE AS AN

03:24:41.202 --> 03:24:43.871
OFFENSIVE- ANOTHER PERSON. SO

03:24:43.938 --> 03:24:45.606
THE RECIDIVISM RATES ARE VERY

03:24:45.673 --> 03:24:49.477
LOW- YOU CAN EXPECT THAT IF WE-

03:24:49.543 --> 03:24:52.380
IF WE INCREASED OR I SHOULD SAY

03:24:52.446 --> 03:24:55.616
LOWERED- THE STANDARD FOR WHO

03:24:55.683 --> 03:24:57.952
GETS RELEASED AND- IT WOULD

03:24:58.019 --> 03:25:00.621
POTENTIALLY AND LIKELY. RESULT

03:25:00.688 --> 03:25:02.089
IN AN INCREASE IN RECIDIVISM

03:25:02.156 --> 03:25:04.258
RATES. IN STORE CLEAN WHAT WE

03:25:04.325 --> 03:25:06.494
FIND FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS

03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:08.963
IS THAT- AND IT'S A IT'S A

03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:15.970
POLICY. WHEN YOU HAVE SOME WHO

03:25:16.037 --> 03:25:18.205
CAN OF VERY SERIOUS CRIME SUCH

03:25:18.272 --> 03:25:21.175
AS MURDER AND RAPE MAN'S. THERE

03:25:21.242 --> 03:25:23.978
TENDS TO BE VERY LOW TO. FOR RE.

03:25:24.045 --> 03:25:25.079
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE SERVING A

03:25:25.146 --> 03:25:27.748
TERM THAT CANNING. OR DID THE

03:25:27.815 --> 03:25:30.651
SENTENCE INCLUDED. NOTE TWENTY

03:25:30.718 --> 03:25:32.953
FIVE YEARS TO LIFE AND SO IF

03:25:33.020 --> 03:25:35.623
SOMEBODY'S RELEASED- PRIOR TO

03:25:35.690 --> 03:25:37.692
THE END OF THEIR LIFE AND THEY

03:25:37.758 --> 03:25:41.696
GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING- A

03:25:41.762 --> 03:25:44.632
VIOLENT- TOWARD SOMEBODY AGAIN.

03:25:44.699 --> 03:25:45.166
HISTORICALLY THERE'S BEEN

03:25:45.232 --> 03:25:47.735
LITTLE TOO FOR THAT AND SO I

03:25:47.802 --> 03:25:49.336
GUESS THE QUESTION FOR

03:25:49.403 --> 03:25:53.240
POLICYMAKERS IS REALLY- WHAT

03:25:53.307 --> 03:25:56.977

APPROPRIATE- FOR PERSONS WHO

03:25:58.879 --> 03:26:02.850
ARE SENTENCED TO LIFE TERMS.

03:26:02.917 --> 03:26:07.088

MEAN THAT WE'RE IN STANDARD-

03:26:17.732 --> 03:26:18.199
BUT I THINK IT'S A REALLY

03:26:18.265 --> 03:26:20.034
IMPORTANT CONSIDER IT A REAL

03:26:20.101 --> 03:26:26.040

PROCESS IN THE SORT OF DATABASE

03:43:18.384 --> 03:43:21.287
DEVELOPMENT- TO TRACK WITH

03:43:21.354 --> 03:43:22.756

WITHIN OUR- TRUST OUR DEAL

03:43:40.106 --> 03:43:42.108
RECORD OF SALES SYSTEM. AND

03:43:42.175 --> 03:43:44.210
AGENCIES WOULD ENSURE THAT

03:43:53.052 --> 03:43:54.521
THAT THAT'S ONE AREA OF THE

03:43:54.587 --> 03:43:56.489
AUDIT THAT WE WOULD NEED TO GO

03:43:56.556 --> 03:43:57.524
INTO THOSE AGENCIES TO BE ABLE

03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:59.025
TO TRY TO ACQUIRE THAT

03:43:59.092 --> 03:44:03.429
INFORMATION. AND THERE'S ALSO-

03:44:03.496 --> 03:44:04.798
THAT TRANSFERS THAT OCCUR

03:44:04.864 --> 03:44:09.402
PRIVATE PARTY. TRANSFERS IN

03:44:09.469 --> 03:44:10.837
BETWEEN THIS ALLOWS FOR CERTAIN

03:44:10.904 --> 03:44:12.338
I OF AGENTS TO TRAIN CERTAIN

03:44:12.405 --> 03:44:14.240
THAT'S TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES.

03:44:14.307 --> 03:44:16.042
AND IN THAT IN THAT DRESS ENTRY

03:44:16.109 --> 03:44:18.111
SYSTEM WHEN THEY ARE CONNECTING

03:44:18.178 --> 03:44:20.547
TO TRANSACTIONS WE DO CHECK FOR

03:44:20.613 --> 03:44:22.148
CERTAIN OR THE DEALER CHECKS

03:44:22.215 --> 03:44:25.251
FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS- AND

03:44:25.318 --> 03:44:27.720
THAT INFORMATION. IS USED TO

03:44:27.787 --> 03:44:28.755
ALLOW CERTAIN AND THEN

03:44:28.822 --> 03:44:30.190
TRANSACTIONS TO OCCUR THE

03:44:30.256 --> 03:44:31.457
SYSTEM HOWEVER THAT IS NOT

03:44:31.524 --> 03:44:35.428
ROUTINE IN THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM

03:44:35.495 --> 03:44:36.029
SO WE DON'T HAVE THIS ABILITY

03:44:36.095 --> 03:44:38.765

HOW DOES FALL OFF AND THE

03:44:42.869 --> 03:44:43.770
ROSTER ALL THE TIMES THAT

03:44:43.837 --> 03:44:45.538
ROSTER CHANGES IT COULD CHANGE

03:44:45.605 --> 03:44:49.876
STATE. SO THIS LITERALLY IS

03:44:49.943 --> 03:44:52.979
THIS. DEFINITION IF YOU WILL-

03:44:53.046 --> 03:44:56.149

03:45:06.526 --> 03:45:07.827
EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THIS IS

03:45:07.894 --> 03:45:10.063
LITERALLY A LIST OF. HARDWARE

03:45:10.129 --> 03:45:13.199

CHALLENGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE

04:01:51.697 --> 04:01:53.832
PANDEMIC. BUT ALSO THAT EXISTED

04:01:53.899 --> 04:01:56.935
BEFORE. IT RECOGNIZES THAT BAD

04:01:57.002 --> 04:01:59.071
JOBS LOW WAGE JOBS EXPLOITATIVE

04:01:59.137 --> 04:02:02.374
JOBS ARE AS MUCH A CHOICE AS

04:02:02.441 --> 04:02:04.009
GOOD JOBS ARE CHOICE AND WE

04:02:04.076 --> 04:02:07.346
HAVE A CHANCE NOW TO SHOW WHERE

04:02:07.412 --> 04:02:09.214
CALIFORNIA'S GONNA COME DOWN ON

04:02:09.281 --> 04:02:11.049
THAT DECISION MAKING. WE NEED

TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY AND WE

04:02:12.818 --> 04:02:14.853
ALSO NEED TO REVERSE A DECADES

04:02:14.920 --> 04:02:16.889
LONG TRENDS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

04:02:16.955 --> 04:02:19.124
OF BOTH IN LOW WAGE WORK AND

04:02:19.191 --> 04:02:19.925
THE GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE

04:02:19.992 --> 04:02:22.461
RICH AND THE POOR. THIS BUDGET

04:02:22.527 --> 04:02:23.896
DOES MORE THAN TALK ABOUT THESE

04:02:23.962 --> 04:02:25.497
ISSUES IT MAKES REAL

04:02:25.564 --> 04:02:28.500
INVESTMENTS AND HOW WE DELIVER

04:02:28.567 --> 04:02:31.003
AND YES THE REQUEST ARE BIG BUT

04:02:31.069 --> 04:02:33.739
THAT'S BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES

04:02:33.805 --> 04:02:35.707
ARE HUGE. SO THE PLAN INCLUDES

04:02:35.774 --> 04:02:37.409
A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

04:02:37.476 --> 04:02:39.411
DOLLAR COMMUNITY ECONOMIC

FOR EACH REGION OF THE STATE

04:02:47.419 --> 04:02:49.121
RECOGNIZING THAT ONE SIZE DOES

04:02:49.187 --> 04:02:51.290
NOT FIT ALL IN CALIFORNIA AND

04:02:51.356 --> 04:02:53.425
WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT

04:02:53.492 --> 04:02:55.060
WHAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND

04:02:55.127 --> 04:02:56.828
GROWTH WILL LOOK LIKE WE HAVE

04:02:56.895 --> 04:02:57.996
TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT JOB

04:02:58.063 --> 04:03:00.666
CREATION. BUT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE

04:03:00.732 --> 04:03:04.436
EMPLOYERS AND INDUSTRIES AND IN

04:03:04.503 --> 04:03:06.605
THE LANGUAGE OF ECONOMIST WE

04:03:06.672 --> 04:03:08.840
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE DEMAND

04:03:08.907 --> 04:03:11.209
SIDE FOR LABOR. THEN THE

04:03:11.276 --> 04:03:12.711
GOVERNOR'S PLAN ALSO INCLUDES

04:03:12.778 --> 04:03:14.346
ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY

04:03:14.413 --> 04:03:16.148
MILLION DOLLARS TO GET WORKERS

04:03:16.214 --> 04:03:18.050
INTO THOSE GOOD JOBS IT

04:03:18.116 --> 04:03:19.217
INCLUDES BUILDING BRIDGES

04:03:19.284 --> 04:03:21.186
BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

04:03:21.253 --> 04:03:23.822
OUR WORKFORCE AGENCIES. IT'S

04:03:23.889 --> 04:03:25.157
ABOUT TRANSFORMING OUR WORDS

04:03:25.223 --> 04:03:27.125
OUR SYSTEM SO THAT WE'RE TRULY

04:03:27.192 --> 04:03:28.360
PREPARING WORKERS FOR THE

04:03:28.427 --> 04:03:29.928
QUALITY JOBS AND MEETING

04:03:29.995 --> 04:03:31.930
EMPLOYER NEEDS AND COMBATING

04:03:31.997 --> 04:03:33.365
THE SYSTEMIC EXCLUSION OF THOSE

04:03:33.432 --> 04:03:35.400
WERE TOO OFTEN LEFT BEHIND EVEN

04:03:35.467 --> 04:03:37.502
IN GOOD TIMES. AND THIS IS THE

04:03:37.569 --> 04:03:39.571
SUPPLY SIDE FOR LABOR SO WE

04:03:39.638 --> 04:03:42.074
CAN'T DO JUST ONE WE KNOW THAT

04:03:42.140 --> 04:03:43.408
IF WE ARE NOT INTENTIONAL BUT

04:03:43.475 --> 04:03:46.011
JOB CREATION ABOUT PLANNING

04:03:46.078 --> 04:03:48.013
REGIONALLY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH

04:03:48.080 --> 04:03:50.015
AND DEVELOPMENT THAT ALL THE

04:03:50.082 --> 04:03:51.550
TRAINING IN THE WORLD WILL NOT

04:03:51.616 --> 04:03:54.920
LIFT WORKERS OUT OF POVERTY.

04:03:54.987 --> 04:03:55.454
AND WILL NOT MAKE REGIONAL

04:03:55.520 --> 04:03:56.788
ECONOMY STRONG. AND WE KNOW

04:03:56.855 --> 04:03:58.290
THAT IF WE ARE TRAINING WITH

04:03:58.357 --> 04:04:00.158
THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS AND

04:04:00.225 --> 04:04:01.827
WORKERS IN MIND AND COMMITTING

04:04:01.893 --> 04:04:03.462
COMMITTING TO TRUE ACCESS FOR

04:04:03.528 --> 04:04:04.529
THOSE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE

04:04:04.596 --> 04:04:06.498
LEFT BEHIND WE WILL REINFORCE

04:04:06.565 --> 04:04:08.533
ALL THE INEQUITIES. AND WE WILL

04:04:08.600 --> 04:04:10.902
MISS OUT ON THE TALENTS AND

04:04:10.969 --> 04:04:11.436
ABILITIES OF CALIFORNIA'S

04:04:11.503 --> 04:04:13.705

AND THE TRAINING. EACH OF THEM

04:04:18.744 --> 04:04:19.911
HAS TWO CATEGORIES IN THE

HAVE TO START PAYING IN IN A

04:30:16.166 --> 04:30:18.302
HIGHER INCREASE FEDERAL TAX AND

04:30:18.368 --> 04:30:19.937
THAT GOES TO PAY DOWN THE

04:30:20.003 --> 04:30:21.705
OUTSTANDING ADVANCE THAT'S WHAT

04:30:21.772 --> 04:30:22.606
HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT

04:30:22.673 --> 04:30:24.541
RECESSION AS WE CURRENTLY

04:30:24.608 --> 04:30:25.676
PROJECT THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA

04:30:25.742 --> 04:30:27.711
OBVIOUSLY START HAPPENING. AND

04:30:27.778 --> 04:30:28.912
THAT WILL START TO PAY DOWN

04:30:28.979 --> 04:30:31.114
THAT LOAN ADVANCE BUT IT TAKES

04:30:31.181 --> 04:30:32.316
A WHILE BEFORE IT STARTS TO

04:30:32.382 --> 04:30:34.017
REALLY PICK UP AND PAY DOWN THE

04:30:34.084 --> 04:30:35.786

ADDITIONAL FEDERAL TAXES. AND

04:30:43.260 --> 04:30:44.828
CHAU AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD IT

04:30:44.895 --> 04:30:46.129
IN THIS COMMITTED BEFORE-

04:30:46.196 --> 04:30:48.065
THERE'S REAL APPREHENSION ON

04:30:48.131 --> 04:30:50.300
THE PART OF EMPLOYERS IS TO-

04:30:50.367 --> 04:30:52.269
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BURDEN MAY BE

04:30:52.336 --> 04:30:54.104
WHEN THAT TIME COMES SO WHAT'S

04:30:54.171 --> 04:30:56.306
THE THINKING. OR THE PROCESS

04:30:56.373 --> 04:30:58.475
FOR- LETTING THEM KNOW IS BORN

04:30:58.542 --> 04:31:00.510
VANCE'S POSSIBLE OR- I GUESS

04:31:00.577 --> 04:31:01.545
PROSPECTIVELY SOFTENING THE

04:31:01.612 --> 04:31:03.380
BLOW IN SOMEWHERE AND IT IS

04:31:03.447 --> 04:31:05.215
SUPPOSED TO LIKE ONE ASSESSMENT

04:31:05.282 --> 04:31:06.617
TO BEGIN THE YEAR WHICH IS. AS

04:31:06.683 --> 04:31:08.919
I UNDERSTAND HOW IT TYPICALLY

04:31:08.986 --> 04:31:11.555
HAPPENS. YEAH WELL AGAIN THANK

YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER- SO

04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:15.359
THAT THE FOOD TAX WHICH AGAIN

04:31:15.425 --> 04:31:17.594
THAT'S ADMINISTERED BY THE IRS

04:31:17.661 --> 04:31:19.529
THAT'S NOT ADMINISTERED BY-

04:31:19.596 --> 04:31:21.331
THAT BECOMES DOING PAYABLE

04:31:21.398 --> 04:31:23.433
JANUARY JANUARY FEBRUARY REACH

04:31:23.500 --> 04:31:25.936
YEAR I BELIEVE- THERE ARE

04:31:26.003 --> 04:31:27.738
NOTIFICATIONS TO EMPLOYERS THAT

04:31:27.804 --> 04:31:29.873
GET PUT OUT BY THE IRS. AND I

04:31:29.940 --> 04:31:31.508
ALSO BELIEVE HE PUTS ON OUR

04:31:31.575 --> 04:31:35.045
WEBSITE- LINKS TO THE IRS- WEB

04:31:35.112 --> 04:31:37.447
PAGES AND NOTIFICATIONS AROUND.

04:31:37.514 --> 04:31:39.883
FOOD- SO EMPLOYERS ARE AWARE-

04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:41.151
THEY THEY NORMALLY HAVE TO

04:31:41.218 --> 04:31:42.619
REPORT THEIR FOOD A LIABILITIES

04:31:42.686 --> 04:31:44.454
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND THEN

04:31:44.521 --> 04:31:46.223
WHEN IT COMES TIME WHEN A STATE

04:31:46.289 --> 04:31:47.391
IS WHAT'S CONSIDERED A CREDIT

04:31:47.457 --> 04:31:49.459
REDUCTION STATE WHERE THEY HAVE

04:31:49.526 --> 04:31:50.961
TO START PAYING THAT POINT 3%

04:31:51.028 --> 04:31:53.063
ANNUALLY- THERE'S A SEPARATE

04:31:53.130 --> 04:31:54.531
FORM THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO

04:31:54.598 --> 04:31:56.400
FILE WITH THE IRS. SO THEY'RE

04:31:56.466 --> 04:31:58.068
NOTIFIED THAT THE STATE THEY'RE

04:31:58.135 --> 04:32:00.337
IN HAS A HIGHER FEDERAL TAX

04:32:00.404 --> 04:32:02.039
RATE AND THEY THEN HAVE TO PAY

04:32:02.105 --> 04:32:03.540
THAT LIKE YOU SAID IN JANUARY

04:32:03.607 --> 04:32:05.909
FEBRUARY EACH YEAR- THE FIRST

04:32:05.976 --> 04:32:07.310
YEAR. THEN EMPLOYERS IN

04:32:07.377 --> 04:32:09.646
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

04:32:09.713 --> 04:32:11.882
THE HIGHER FOOD TAX WOULD BE

04:32:11.948 --> 04:32:13.617
FOR TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

04:32:13.684 --> 04:32:15.352
WHICH BECOMES DOING PAYABLE IN

04:32:15.419 --> 04:32:19.756
JANUARY. OF TWENTY TWENTY

04:32:19.823 --> 04:32:20.590
THREE. AB PREACHER THAT SO WITH

04:32:20.657 --> 04:32:22.793
THE EXTRA. BE AND BECAUSE YOU

04:32:22.859 --> 04:32:24.361
DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL- THAT

04:32:24.428 --> 04:32:25.429
THE BUSINESSES WILL HAVE

04:32:25.495 --> 04:32:27.330
RECOVERED SAYS THAT THIS ISN'T.

04:32:27.397 --> 04:32:29.666
A REALLY ONEROUS- DOESN'T

ABOUT 5% OF THE LOANS WE'VE

TAKEN TODAY. AND THINKING ABOUT

04:34:22.145 --> 04:34:23.013
THE MECHANICS OF HOW THE

04:34:23.079 --> 04:34:24.381

THAT THE DEPOSIT WOULDN'T HAVE

04:35:01.751 --> 04:35:04.454

TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC.

04:35:11.194 --> 04:35:13.129
THE DEPOSIT WOULD- HOWEVER

04:35:13.196 --> 04:35:14.931
SLIGHTLY REDUCE THE STATE'S

04:35:14.998 --> 04:35:16.533
INTEREST PAYMENTS GOING FORWARD

04:35:16.600 --> 04:35:18.902

RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT THIRTY

04:35:22.105 --> 04:35:23.273
SIX MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE OF

04:35:23.340 --> 04:35:25.108
THE WAIVERS THAT. WERE GRANTED

04:35:25.175 --> 04:35:26.243

FEDERAL LEGISLATION- THAT

04:35:27.911 --> 04:35:29.079
SUBSEQUENT YEARS INTEREST

04:35:29.145 --> 04:35:30.614

04:35:30.680 --> 04:35:31.181
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

04:35:31.248 --> 04:35:33.750
PER YEAR- AND THIS. THE ONE

04:35:33.817 --> 04:35:34.818
POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR

04:35:34.885 --> 04:35:35.886
DEPOSIT WILL REDUCE THOSE

04:35:35.952 --> 04:35:37.587
SOMEWHAT GOING FORWARD OVER THE

INTEREST RATE IS THAT.

04:35:45.829 --> 04:35:46.997
IRRESPECTIVE OF THE RATE OF

04:35:47.063 --> 04:35:52.769
INFLATION OR MIGHT THAT CHANGE.

04:35:52.836 --> 04:35:53.637
IF INFLATION WERE TO RISE.

04:35:53.703 --> 04:35:56.506
VETERANS CHANGE ON. THIS IS-

04:35:56.573 --> 04:35:57.874
WELL WE'LL OCCURRING. AFTER

04:35:57.941 --> 04:36:00.477
SEPTEMBER ONE WAIVER ENDS- AT-

04:36:00.543 --> 04:36:02.212
FEDERAL INTEREST RATE OF TWO

04:36:02.279 --> 04:36:04.114
POINT 3% SO IT'S YOU KNOW.

04:36:04.180 --> 04:36:06.249
HISTORICALLY LOW- IT MAKES

04:36:06.316 --> 04:36:07.550
BORROWING TERMS MUCH MORE

04:36:07.617 --> 04:36:08.551
FAVORABLE TO THE STATE RIGHT

04:36:08.618 --> 04:36:10.720
NOW- BUT THOSE RATESARE TIED

04:36:10.787 --> 04:36:12.622
TO- LOOSELY TIED TO THE FEDERAL

04:36:12.689 --> 04:36:14.758
FUNDS RATE. AND THEREFORE IF

04:36:14.824 --> 04:36:15.759
OVERALL INTEREST RATES WERE TO

04:36:15.825 --> 04:36:16.960
INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

04:36:17.027 --> 04:36:18.395
YEARS- THE STATE'S INTEREST

04:36:18.461 --> 04:36:20.230
PAYMENTS AS A RESULT- COULD

04:36:20.297 --> 04:36:21.631
COULD INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY

04:36:21.698 --> 04:36:24.668
ANNA. YEAH ALL THE SUDDEN THE

04:36:24.734 --> 04:36:27.904
FAVORABILITY. OF THIS ONE

04:36:27.971 --> 04:36:28.572
STRUCTURE LOOKS A LOT DIFFERENT.

04:36:28.638 --> 04:36:31.174
THAT'S YOUR HAZARD ANYTHING- TO

04:36:31.241 --> 04:36:33.076
MAKING A LARGE CONTRIBUTION NOW

04:36:33.143 --> 04:36:37.380
OUT OF- THE PRESENT SURPLUS. I

04:36:37.447 --> 04:36:39.015
WOULD DEFERRED THE QUESTION TO

04:36:39.082 --> 04:36:40.917
THE ADMINISTRATION- OBVIOUSLY

04:36:40.984 --> 04:36:42.919
THE REVISION PROPOSAL IS MORE

04:36:42.986 --> 04:36:43.620
THAN ONE POINT ONE BILLION

04:36:43.687 --> 04:36:45.722
DOLLAR DEPOSIT- IT ALSO I

04:36:45.789 --> 04:36:47.524
SHOULD ADD INCLUDES A-

04:36:47.590 --> 04:36:49.359
STIPULATION THAT ANY LEFTOVER

04:36:49.426 --> 04:36:52.729
RESIDUAL A. R. P. ACT. OF FUNDS

04:36:52.796 --> 04:36:54.864
AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY

04:36:54.931 --> 04:36:55.432
FOUR WOULD BE USED THE SAME

04:36:55.498 --> 04:36:56.967
PURPOSE WE HONESTLY DON'T KNOW

04:36:57.033 --> 04:36:58.868
IF ONES WERE DESPERATELY DO HOW

04:36:58.935 --> 04:37:00.570
ARE STILL BE- BUT IT'S

04:37:00.637 --> 04:37:01.705
CERTAINLY A QUESTION FOR THE

04:37:01.771 --> 04:37:03.740
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THIS

04:37:03.807 --> 04:37:05.842
TIME- HOW HOW TO USE THESE

04:37:05.909 --> 04:37:09.612

LOCAL AND DIRECT THIS QUESTION

TO MR ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I

04:37:19.656 --> 04:37:23.026
THINK IT IS IT'S THAT KIND OF

04:37:23.093 --> 04:37:25.261
AN ANALYSIS SO- THAT WOULD. BE

04:37:25.328 --> 04:37:29.366
REQUIRED- WOOD STRIKING TO ME

04:37:29.432 --> 04:37:32.235
ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT BESIDES

04:37:32.302 --> 04:37:34.938
JUST THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DEBT-

04:37:35.005 --> 04:37:37.007
IS THE USE OF GENERAL FUND

04:37:37.073 --> 04:37:40.710
MONEY- REALLY TO TRY TO TAKE

04:37:40.777 --> 04:37:42.512

POINT WILL BE LIQUIDATED IT

04:38:34.697 --> 04:38:35.532
WOULD TURN INTO ONE TIME. ONE

WHAT'S- WILL MAKE MORE SENSE AT

04:38:54.584 --> 04:38:56.019
SOME POINT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

04:38:56.086 --> 04:38:57.854

05:31:12.886 --> 05:31:13.620
DON'T EVEN INEQUALITY IN THE

05:31:13.687 --> 05:31:15.822
PRE PANDEMIC ECONOMY WAS ALSO

05:31:15.889 --> 05:31:16.656
FOR NOTABLE BUT IT DOESN'T

05:31:16.723 --> 05:31:17.824
OTHER THING IN ADDITION TO

05:31:17.891 --> 05:31:19.859
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE RECOVER.

05:31:19.926 --> 05:31:23.230
HE THINKS ABOUT HOW WE- FORWARD.

05:31:23.296 --> 05:31:24.364
HOW DO WE MAKE A TREND. TO A

05:31:24.431 --> 05:31:25.999
HIGHER ECONOMY HOW DO WE MAKE A

05:31:26.066 --> 05:31:27.367
TRANSITION SPECIFICALLY TO

05:31:27.434 --> 05:31:29.903
CARBON NEUTRALITY- AND SO THIS

05:31:29.970 --> 05:31:31.671
IS PART IN PARCEL RECOVERY I

05:31:31.738 --> 05:31:32.505
DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS IN A WAY

05:31:32.572 --> 05:31:33.573
THAT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE TRYING

05:31:33.640 --> 05:31:35.475
TO SORT OF. DO GOOD BY DOING

05:31:35.542 --> 05:31:36.843
CLIMATE WORK BUT THAT'S GOING

05:31:36.910 --> 05:31:38.144
TO AFFECT EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY

05:31:38.211 --> 05:31:40.046
INOCULATION IN CALIFORNIA. IS

05:31:40.113 --> 05:31:42.749
IMPACTED BY OR WILL IMPACT.

05:31:42.816 --> 05:31:44.050
CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALSO

05:31:44.117 --> 05:31:46.486
BECAUSE- CARBON NEUTRALITY IS

05:31:46.553 --> 05:31:48.755
RIGHT NOW. A A DRIVER OF THE

05:31:48.822 --> 05:31:50.657
GLOBAL ECONOMY. SO IF

05:31:50.724 --> 05:31:52.659
CALIFORNIA WANTS TO RETAIN ITS

05:31:52.726 --> 05:31:54.527
COMPETITIVENESS. AND COMPETE

05:31:54.594 --> 05:31:56.463
AND INNOVATION AND ITS RECORD

05:31:56.529 --> 05:31:58.431
AS A STATE ECONOMY THAT TO PLAY

05:31:58.498 --> 05:32:00.433
IN THE SPACE IS EXTRAORDINARILY

05:32:00.500 --> 05:32:01.568
IMPORTANT SO NOT JUST FOR SORT

05:32:01.635 --> 05:32:05.238
OF- CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER.

05:32:05.305 --> 05:32:06.640
AND LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS BUT

05:32:06.706 --> 05:32:07.841
ALSO PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND

05:32:07.907 --> 05:32:08.775
BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IT'S

05:32:08.842 --> 05:32:11.011
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT AND I

05:32:11.077 --> 05:32:12.379
ALSO SAY THAT. JUST SO WE DON'T

05:32:12.445 --> 05:32:13.913
THINK WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT.

05:32:13.980 --> 05:32:15.081
CARBON NEUTRALITY THE

05:32:15.148 --> 05:32:17.284
TRANSITION IS ALSO A CHANCE FOR

05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:18.318
US TO GET IN THIS FUND HELPS US

05:32:18.385 --> 05:32:19.719
GET IN FRONT OF HELP EVERY

05:32:19.786 --> 05:32:21.187
REGION GET IN FRONT OF THE

05:32:21.254 --> 05:32:22.922
MACROECONOMIC CHANGES THAT ARE

05:32:22.989 --> 05:32:30.630
TAKING PLACE EVERY. DAY AUTUMN

05:32:30.697 --> 05:32:33.767
IS A ASIAN. GLOBAL IS- THE

05:32:33.833 --> 05:32:35.268
KINDS OF- THE KINDS OF IN THAT

05:32:35.335 --> 05:32:37.170
ARE. A READ AND IF JOB AND ENDS

05:32:37.237 --> 05:32:39.372
THERE SO THIS A WAY UP. ALL OF

05:32:39.439 --> 05:32:41.341
THAT- IN A WAY OF. ALLOWS READ

05:32:41.408 --> 05:32:43.576
TO DO. A FUTURE CALL. THAT IS-

05:32:43.643 --> 05:32:45.011
OF THE STATE OF. SO LET ME SAY

05:32:45.078 --> 05:32:46.146
NOW THAT THE- CREEK THING ABOUT

05:32:46.212 --> 05:32:48.481
THIS FAR IS THAT IT IS A REGION.

05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:50.884
OFF WE HER YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.

05:32:50.950 --> 05:32:53.353
WE THE LEAD. LEAD ON THIS WE

05:32:53.420 --> 05:32:53.887
HAVE HEARD YOU READ. YOUR

05:32:53.953 --> 05:32:55.989
BECAUSE- THAT IS THE STATE JOB

05:32:56.056 --> 05:32:57.557
SWOOP IN DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS IN

05:32:57.624 --> 05:32:59.726
REGIONAL ECONOMIES. RIGHT BUT

05:32:59.793 --> 05:33:01.461
THE IDEA IS THAT- THE STATE

05:33:01.528 --> 05:33:03.463
REALLY CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT

05:33:03.530 --> 05:33:05.665
DETERMINE. THE DESTINY OF

05:33:05.732 --> 05:33:07.901
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC REGIONS

05:33:07.967 --> 05:33:09.402
WE SEE OUR ROLE IN THIS IS THE

05:33:09.469 --> 05:33:10.503
ROLES IS WHEN WE DESIGNED THE

05:33:10.570 --> 05:33:12.772
FUN LIKE THIS- BUILT AS I WILL

05:33:12.839 --> 05:33:14.774
MENTION- VERY MUCH OF SOME

05:33:14.841 --> 05:33:17.644
STRUCTURES THAT WE- ADMIRED AND

05:33:17.711 --> 05:33:19.079
FOLLOWED. FROM YOUR LEAD

05:33:19.145 --> 05:33:21.047
INCLUDING THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:33:21.114 --> 05:33:23.083
SALAS IS. AB ONE OF SIX BUT

05:33:23.149 --> 05:33:25.085
MORE ON THAT LATER WHAT WE SEE

05:33:25.151 --> 05:33:25.585
OUR ROLE ESSENTIALLY IS

05:33:25.652 --> 05:33:36.129
PROVIDING. RESOURCES FOR THE

05:33:36.196 --> 05:33:36.896
REGION TO SHE THEIR TRAY.

05:33:36.963 --> 05:33:38.932
BECAUSE WHAT MAKES SENSE. IN A

05:33:38.998 --> 05:33:42.068
FOR A CAN. IN THE C. THAT IS.

05:33:42.135 --> 05:33:47.507
WITH WHILE FIRE. WITH AND A

05:33:47.574 --> 05:33:49.743
COLLAPSE. IN IN THE NEED TO

05:33:49.809 --> 05:33:54.814
STAY UP BY. FEEDS IN- AND- WHAT

05:33:54.881 --> 05:33:57.117
PRODUCT. IS DIFFERENT THAN.

05:33:57.183 --> 05:33:58.318
HAPPENING IN THE VALLEY.

05:33:58.385 --> 05:34:00.653
MANAGING GROUND- REDUCTION

05:34:00.720 --> 05:34:04.124
BECAUSE OF. IN AGRA TRADE. OR

05:34:04.190 --> 05:34:06.292
REALLY IN THE CURRENT WHICH BY

05:34:06.359 --> 05:34:08.428
THE WAY INCREDIBLY NOT REALLY

05:34:08.495 --> 05:34:11.331
GAS IN THIS. GOING HUNDRED TRY.

05:34:11.398 --> 05:34:14.601
IN LA SO WHAT LOTS OF THINGS BY.

05:34:14.667 --> 05:34:17.570
AND BY AND SO WANT TO GIVE

05:34:17.637 --> 05:34:19.038
THOSE REGIONS THE CHAIN TO

05:34:19.105 --> 05:34:20.206
DECIDE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO

05:34:20.273 --> 05:34:23.743
THEIR OWN. THE OTHER THING THAT.

05:34:23.810 --> 05:34:25.979
WE WANT TO DO TO OUR SUPPORT

05:34:26.045 --> 05:34:29.115
THE IN SO. AND INCLUDES TAPE.

05:34:29.182 --> 05:34:31.785
RIGHT WHERE LOCALS. COME TO DO

05:34:31.851 --> 05:34:43.763
TO. AS I SAID THERE. FUTURE.

05:34:43.830 --> 05:34:45.799
BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T. WHAT TO

05:34:45.865 --> 05:34:47.167
DO BUT WE DO PUT SOME

05:34:47.233 --> 05:34:48.201
GUARDRAILS ON THE MONEY SO WE

05:34:48.268 --> 05:34:49.969
DO A COUPLE THINGS WE'RE GOING

05:34:50.036 --> 05:34:52.071
TO HAVE A SAY. IN WHO IS AT THE

05:34:52.138 --> 05:34:53.606
TABLE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT

05:34:53.673 --> 05:34:55.041
THERE'S A PLACE FOR LABOR SO

05:34:55.108 --> 05:34:56.476
THAT WORKERS HAVE A SAY. WE

05:34:56.543 --> 05:34:57.277
WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A

05:34:57.343 --> 05:34:58.912
PLACE FOR COMMUNITY VOICES

05:34:58.978 --> 05:35:01.181
ESPECIALLY. BLACK INDIGENOUS

05:35:01.247 --> 05:35:03.550
AND PEOPLE OF COLOR- THAT HAVE

05:35:03.616 --> 05:35:04.851
TOO OFTEN BEEN LEFT OUT OF

05:35:04.918 --> 05:35:07.654
DECISION MAKING- AS WELL AS-

05:35:07.720 --> 05:35:09.923
BUSINESSES. GOVERNMENT THE LAND

05:35:09.989 --> 05:35:11.257
TO BE EDUCATION THE WORKFORCE

05:35:11.324 --> 05:35:12.358
SYSTEM THE SOCIAL SERVICE

05:35:12.425 --> 05:35:14.227
SYSTEM SO IT IS A BIG TABLE WE

05:35:14.294 --> 05:35:15.628
WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE'S

05:35:15.695 --> 05:35:17.130
ACTUALLY A PLACE AT THE TABLE

05:35:17.197 --> 05:35:18.298
FOR THE PEOPLE WHOSE VOICES

05:35:18.364 --> 05:35:20.333
HAVE NOT FULLY BEEN HURT. SO

05:35:20.400 --> 05:35:21.334
THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE ALSO

05:35:21.401 --> 05:35:22.569
GOING TO SEND A HIGH ROAD

05:35:22.635 --> 05:35:24.337
AGENDA. THERE WILL BE METRICS

05:35:24.404 --> 05:35:25.472
AND ACCOUNTABILITY THERE WILL

05:35:25.538 --> 05:35:27.140
BE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT

05:35:27.207 --> 05:35:28.308
THERE WILL BE NO DOLLAR THAT

05:35:28.374 --> 05:35:29.142
GOES OUT THE DOOR WITHOUT AN

05:35:29.209 --> 05:35:32.846
EVALUATION. PLAN AND I'VE BEEN

05:35:32.912 --> 05:35:33.713
A METRICS PLANT BUT- REALLY

05:35:33.780 --> 05:35:35.048
LARGE THE METRICS ARE GOING TO

05:35:35.114 --> 05:35:36.015
BE AROUND THE HIGH ROAD WHAT WE

05:35:36.082 --> 05:35:37.584
MEAN BY THAT AS SECRETARY SU

05:35:37.650 --> 05:35:39.452
EXPLAINED AS- SUSTAINABILITY.

05:35:39.519 --> 05:35:40.653
SO HOW DOES ANY OF THIS

05:35:40.720 --> 05:35:41.988
INVESTMENT ALIGNS THE STATE'S

05:35:42.055 --> 05:35:43.723
CLIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS

05:35:43.790 --> 05:35:45.425
THERE WILL BE EQUITY METRICS.

05:35:45.492 --> 05:35:47.794
HOW IS THIS ADVANCE INCLUSIVITY

05:35:47.861 --> 05:35:49.896
HOUSES LIFT UP ALL CALIFORNIANS

05:35:49.963 --> 05:35:51.130
SO THAT EVERYONE BENEFITS IN

05:35:51.197 --> 05:35:53.533
THE TRANSITION- HOW DOES THIS

05:35:53.600 --> 05:35:55.502
ADDRESS JOB QUALITY. WHICH AS

05:35:55.568 --> 05:35:56.936
DIRECTOR RAINY DESCRIBED SO

05:35:57.003 --> 05:35:58.805
ELOQUENTLY WE CANNOT DELIVER

05:35:58.872 --> 05:36:00.640
EQUITY WITHOUT JOB QUALITY SO

05:36:00.707 --> 05:36:01.608
HOW ARE WE GOING TO CREATE

05:36:01.674 --> 05:36:03.009
THOSE GOOD JOBS HOW ARE WE

05:36:03.076 --> 05:36:04.010
GOING TO TRACK THAT THEY'RE

05:36:04.077 --> 05:36:05.011
PRETTY GOOD JOBS. ALL OF THESE

05:36:05.078 --> 05:36:05.879
THINGS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

05:36:05.945 --> 05:36:08.047
EXPECT FROM THE INVESTMENTS.

05:36:08.114 --> 05:36:09.082
I'M THE KIND OF THING THAT

05:36:09.148 --> 05:36:11.117
SUPPORTS. REALLY ROBUST

05:36:11.184 --> 05:36:13.319
ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT BENEFITS

05:36:13.386 --> 05:36:14.654
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS I

05:36:14.721 --> 05:36:16.189
SAID LOOK VERY DIFFERENT. IN

05:36:16.256 --> 05:36:17.790
EVERY REGION BUT IN EVERY

05:36:17.857 --> 05:36:19.359
SINGLE REGION IT WILL LIFT UP

05:36:19.425 --> 05:36:21.294
FAMILIES. AND WORKERS AND

05:36:21.361 --> 05:36:23.263
COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES AND-

05:36:23.329 --> 05:36:25.832
ALSO CRITICALLY THE TAX BASE.

05:36:25.899 --> 05:36:27.734
RIGHT MANY REASONS WHICH DEPEND

05:36:27.800 --> 05:36:29.168
ON PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES ARE

05:36:29.235 --> 05:36:30.837
GOING TO LOSE THEIR TAX BASE OR

05:36:30.904 --> 05:36:32.238
SEE THAT DECLINE OR HAVE SEEN A

05:36:32.305 --> 05:36:34.340
DECLINE. AND SO. HOW WE BUILD

05:36:34.407 --> 05:36:36.109
THE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN EACH

05:36:36.175 --> 05:36:37.176
REGION THAT CALIFORNIANS

05:36:37.243 --> 05:36:38.545
DESERVE AND RESPECT SO THAT'S

05:36:38.611 --> 05:36:39.479
REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS

05:36:39.546 --> 05:36:41.114
INVESTMENT THAT HAS TO. LIFT UP

05:36:41.180 --> 05:36:43.683
COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND THEN.

05:36:43.750 --> 05:36:45.485
DISTRIBUTION I WILL SAY IS ALSO

05:36:45.552 --> 05:36:47.287
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WE WANT TO

05:36:47.353 --> 05:36:48.221
GUARANTEE THAT THERE IS

05:36:48.288 --> 05:36:49.923
INVESTMENT IN REGIONS. WHICH

05:36:49.989 --> 05:36:51.758
HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BY THE

05:36:51.824 --> 05:36:56.362
PANDEMIC. WHICH HAVE. BORNE THE-

05:36:56.429 --> 05:36:57.130
GREATEST BROWN OF CLIMATE

05:36:57.196 --> 05:36:58.565
CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHAU.

05:36:58.631 --> 05:37:00.166
AND THOSE INLAND REGIONS THAT

05:37:00.233 --> 05:37:01.568
HAVE OFTEN BEEN LEFT OUT OF

05:37:01.634 --> 05:37:03.836
CALIFORNIA'S STORIED ECONOMIC

05:37:03.903 --> 05:37:05.471
PROSPERITY RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT

05:37:05.538 --> 05:37:06.806
WE REALLY COMMITTED TO DOING

05:37:06.873 --> 05:37:07.974
THAT WITH THIS MYSELF THIS

05:37:08.041 --> 05:37:09.042
MONEY IS COMPETITIVE BUT IS

05:37:09.108 --> 05:37:10.843
ALSO GUARANTEED TO GO TO EVERY

05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:12.712
REGION. AND THE LAST THING I

05:37:12.779 --> 05:37:14.847
WILL SAY BEFORE WE GO INTO MORE

05:37:14.914 --> 05:37:15.748
DETAILS IS THAT THIS IS PART

05:37:15.815 --> 05:37:18.318
OF. AND I THINK BOTH HIM AND-

05:37:18.384 --> 05:37:20.286
SECRETARY SUE EMPHASIZED THIS

05:37:20.353 --> 05:37:22.956
IS PART OF A COHERENT COME BACK

05:37:23.022 --> 05:37:24.591
VISION IT IS NOT FRAGMENTED IN

05:37:24.657 --> 05:37:27.694
FACT. THIS WILL CONNECT TO ALL

05:37:27.760 --> 05:37:29.262
INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE BUDGET

05:37:29.329 --> 05:37:31.230
NOT ONLY TO THE WORKFORCE

05:37:31.297 --> 05:37:33.066
INVESTMENTS AND HRT PIECE THAT

05:37:33.132 --> 05:37:34.100
WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW THAT

05:37:34.167 --> 05:37:36.035
WORKS- BUT IT CONNECTS TO.

05:37:36.102 --> 05:37:38.037
COMMUNITY CAPACITY INVESTMENTS

05:37:38.104 --> 05:37:38.805
WHICH WERE LIFTED UP AND

05:37:38.871 --> 05:37:40.340
PRIORITIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE

05:37:40.406 --> 05:37:41.641
SO THAT TEN SEVENTY TWO

05:37:41.708 --> 05:37:44.010
INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE WRITTEN IN

05:37:44.077 --> 05:37:47.046
ON. THE FACT THAT WE CANNOT DO

05:37:47.113 --> 05:37:48.748
THIS WORK UNLESS WE BUILD

05:37:48.815 --> 05:37:50.984
CAPACITY IN COMMUNITY GROUPS TO

05:37:51.050 --> 05:37:52.352
JOIN IN THE WORK AND THAT'S

05:37:52.418 --> 05:37:53.453
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SO THERE'S

05:37:53.519 --> 05:37:54.721
A SEPARATE FUNDING FOR THAT THE

05:37:54.787 --> 05:37:56.222
CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE. AND

05:37:56.289 --> 05:37:57.090
OTHER PLACES THAT WE ARE

05:37:57.156 --> 05:37:58.725
DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THAT SO

05:37:58.791 --> 05:38:00.593
THAT'S NOT IN SORT OF NAME ONLY

AGENCY WORK GROUP OF THE THREE

05:43:37.029 --> 05:43:38.197
AGENCIES BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

05:43:38.264 --> 05:43:40.900
PRIMARILY A WORKFORCE- FUNCTION

05:43:40.967 --> 05:43:41.934
AS PRIMARILY ECONOMIC

05:43:42.001 --> 05:43:43.336

REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE

05:44:02.655 --> 05:44:04.590
ON THAT. THE IDEA WAS A NIMBLE

05:44:04.657 --> 05:44:06.859
FUND- THAT WE COULD STREAMLINE

05:44:06.926 --> 05:44:07.994
THE STATE'S ROLE UP FRONT TO

05:44:08.060 --> 05:44:08.527
GET THE MONEY OUT TO THE

05:44:08.594 --> 05:44:09.895
REGION'S AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

05:44:09.962 --> 05:44:11.097
IT WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH

05:44:11.163 --> 05:44:11.998
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE LABOR

05:44:12.064 --> 05:44:13.532
AGENCY YES BUT THE DECISION

05:44:13.599 --> 05:44:15.534
MAKING. ARE THE ACCOUNTABILITY

05:44:15.601 --> 05:44:17.236
WE ALL THE HEALTH- AT THAT

05:44:17.303 --> 05:44:19.772
CABIN A LITTLE. US SO WE FEEL

05:44:19.839 --> 05:44:21.207
CONFIDENT THAT THAT IS A

05:44:21.273 --> 05:44:24.310
WORKABLE- SOLUTION- AND

05:44:24.377 --> 05:44:26.145
ACCOUNTABLE SOLUTION. THE THING

05:44:26.212 --> 05:44:28.781
I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE JUST

05:44:28.848 --> 05:44:29.382
TRANSITION ROADMAP IS THAT. WE

05:44:29.448 --> 05:44:30.983
HAD THIS ONCE IN A- LIFETIME

05:44:31.050 --> 05:44:32.218
RIGHT OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST

05:44:32.284 --> 05:44:33.919
THIS FUND IT WOULD BE CRAZY TO

05:44:33.986 --> 05:44:35.021
COME UP WITH THE ROADMAP AND

05:44:35.087 --> 05:44:36.355
THEN SAY THERE'S NO MONEY TO DO

05:44:36.422 --> 05:44:37.456
ANYTHING RIGHT. AND THIS IS

05:44:37.523 --> 05:44:39.325
ALSO I THINK THE IDEA OF STAGED

05:44:39.392 --> 05:44:40.893
INVESTMENTS IS ACTUALLY

05:44:40.960 --> 05:44:43.029
INTRIGUING BUT- I WOULD SAY

05:44:43.095 --> 05:44:45.631
THAT- YOU KNOW. I FEEL LIKE

05:44:45.698 --> 05:44:46.832
FOLKS HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE

05:44:46.899 --> 05:44:48.467
PLANNING AND WE NEED TO PLAN

WE CAN ALL TAKE PRIDE IN. AND

06:14:22.940 --> 06:14:23.474
THAT WE ARE TREATED BETTER. I

06:14:23.541 --> 06:14:25.409
FINALLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

06:14:25.476 --> 06:14:27.745

HAVE A COMPONENT OF THE

06:14:29.380 --> 06:14:30.414
PROPOSAL TO BE A PUBLIC

06:14:30.481 --> 06:14:32.449
EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. WHERE WE

06:14:32.516 --> 06:14:33.984

06:14:43.194 --> 06:14:44.929
REITERATE THAT I OFTEN HEAR

06:14:44.995 --> 06:14:46.964

IS NOT. I'M YOU KNOW COLLECTING

06:14:49.200 --> 06:14:51.035
TRASH FROM ROADWAYS AND

06:14:51.101 --> 06:14:52.469
CERTAINLY THE PROPOSAL WOULD

06:14:52.536 --> 06:14:53.971
ALLOW US TO COLLECT TRASH FROM

06:14:54.038 --> 06:14:56.240

06:15:00.477 --> 06:15:01.545
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT

06:15:01.612 --> 06:15:02.613
MORE TRASH AT A GREATER

06:15:02.680 --> 06:15:05.082
FREQUENCY. I CAN TELL YOU I'VE

06:15:05.149 --> 06:15:06.217
BEEN OUT WITH OUR MAINTENANCE

06:15:06.283 --> 06:15:07.985
CREWS ON REQUESTED TRASH FROM

ROADWAYS. AND OFTENTIMES AND

06:15:11.021 --> 06:15:12.389
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE IT'S SO

06:15:12.456 --> 06:15:13.557
BAD THAT OUR CREWS ARE GETTING

06:15:13.624 --> 06:15:15.226

06:15:29.807 --> 06:15:30.841
THIS PROPOSAL IT'S REALLY THE

06:15:30.908 --> 06:15:33.177

06:17:42.906 --> 06:17:46.076
IN- DECIDING WHERE THE

06:29:06.790 --> 06:29:08.091
THINK THESE PROPOSALS REPRESENT

06:29:08.158 --> 06:29:09.559

LEGISLATURE WITH REGARD TO THIS

06:29:10.927 --> 06:29:12.862
PROJECT WE SUGGEST THAT THE

06:29:12.929 --> 06:29:14.464
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER TWO MAIN

06:29:14.531 --> 06:29:17.167
THINGS AS IT MAKES DECISIONS ON

06:29:30.747 --> 06:29:31.948
SUFFICIENT THAT WE KNOW THAT

06:29:32.015 --> 06:29:33.683
THE PROJECT HAS HAD A HISTORY

06:29:33.750 --> 06:29:36.119
OF INCREASES IN COSTS. SECOND

06:29:36.186 --> 06:29:37.387
WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE

06:29:37.454 --> 06:29:38.922
CONSIDER ITS COMMITMENT TO

06:29:38.988 --> 06:29:41.357
FULLY FUNDING THE PROJECT. THE

06:29:41.424 --> 06:29:42.992
LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO MEETING

06:29:43.059 --> 06:29:44.360

THE LEGISLATURE IS COMMITTED TO

06:29:52.535 --> 06:29:53.670
FINDING MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

06:29:53.737 --> 06:29:55.305

THEN WE THINK THE AUTHORITIES

06:29:59.843 --> 06:30:02.312
GENERAL APPROACH IS REASONABLE.

06:30:02.378 --> 06:30:03.747
HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

06:30:03.813 --> 06:30:04.748
