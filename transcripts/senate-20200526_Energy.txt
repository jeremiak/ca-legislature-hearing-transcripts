I HILL YOU HAVE THE FLOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON BEHALF OF SENATOR HUESO. SB TEN FIFTY EIGHT IS A RELIEF BILL NEEDED TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS DURING DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES INCLUDING THE ONGOING PANDEMIC. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE INTERNET SEARCH THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ISPS TO FILE ANNUAL EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLANS WITH THE CPUC AND IDENTIFIES THE BASIC ELEMENTS THESE PLANS MUST CONTAIN. SB TEN FIFTY EIGHT WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND. CAN KEEP THEIR HOME PHONE SERVICE AT AFFORDABLE RATES THROUGH THE LIFELINE PROGRAM. EVEN BEFORE COVERT NINETEEN CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLED WITH A LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS LACK BROADBAND SERVICE. WELL 5% OF CALIFORNIANS CANNOT ACCESS BROADBAND DUE TO A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES NEARLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. DO NOT HAVE BROADBAND DUE TO AFFORDABILITY. I KNOW SENATOR HUESO HAS FOUGHT HARD FOR EXPANSION OF THESE SERVICES IN HIS DISTRICT AS I HAVE FOR MY COAST SIDE RESIDENTS. RECENT EMERGENCIES INCLUDING WILDFIRES POWER SHUT OFF IN PANDEMIC HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO HAVE EMERGENCY PLANS. BUT WE HOPE THAT THE WORST OF UTILITY POWER SHOT OFF AND THE PANDEMIC ARE BEHIND US WE ARE LIKELY TO FACE MORE CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE. AND WE NEED TO PREPARE NOW TO LIMIT THE RISKS FACING CALIFORNIANS.

SB TEN FIFTY IT OVERLOOKS THE EXTRAORDINARY COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IN KEEPING CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTED. DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FORTUNATELY BUT BELIEVE ALTHOUGH WELL ATTENDED THE RECENT AMENDMENTS ARE UNNECESSARY AND LARGELY PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW. WIRELESS INDUSTRY AND OTHER TELECOM PROVIDERS SIGNED TO KEEP AMERICA'S CONNECTED PLEDGE- BUT NO TERMINATION FEES AND NO LATE FEES. EACH COMPANY ALSO HAS PROVIDED THINGS LIKE CREE DATA OPTIONS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. NEARLY EFFORTS TO PORTRAY EDUCATION INCLUDING- SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION- THURMAN'S DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE. ON THE ISSUES BAD WE OPPOSE OTHER REQUIREMENT THAT WIRELESS CARRIERS PROVIDE SERVICE ANY RATE DEEMED AFFORDABLE BY THE UC THE ASSEMBLY PREEMPTED BY- FEDERAL STATUTES SECTION THREE THIRTY TO SEE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT. ALTHOUGH THE. THE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT WILL CHANGE CARRIERS INVOLUNTARILY PROVIDING THE INPUT THE INFORMATION TO THE P. UC THAT UP BY TO BE OKAY. HOWEVER THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN HAVING A STATE STATUTE REQUIRING AND USING EVALUATING SUCH AFFORDABILITY. WE ALSO OPPOSE A MANDATE TO IDENTIFY CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PLAN. BECAUSE OUR TRADE SECRETS- DISCLOSED PROPRIETARY AND COMPETITIVE INFORMATION. WHICH ALSO WHEN VIOLATE VIOLATE YES HE DID THE CLUES ABOUT THE ALREADY OVER WIRELESS CARRIER NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. THOSE AND OTHER REASONS WE ASK FOR NOBLE. THANK YOU MISTER CARLSON IS MISS MCINTYRE ON THE LINE.

NORTH THE EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE IN BROADBAND NETWORK IN PROVIDING BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WHEN THE STAY AT HOME ORDER HAVE MORE ACTIVITY TO GO ONLINE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN BROADBAND NETWORKS LIKE THE CGA MEMBER COMPANIES WE HAD MADE- OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE ONLINE WORKING FROM HOME AND HEALTHCARE AND PEOPLE. ALL POP. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW AND STATE RATE REGULATE OF INTER THERE MAY. K. I. S. P.'S MAILLET KERLEY OFF RID COSTS INTERNET SERVICE FOR QUALIFIED LOW INCOME FAMILIES. BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE CPC TO DEFINE AND AFFORDABLE CLAP OF BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE AND REQUIRE AYE IF PEACE TO OPERATE FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL DISPLAYED BY A DISASTER OR UNDER GUIDANCE TO STAY AT HOME DURING THE STATE OF A STATE OR LOCAL EMERGENCY. IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT HEALTH EMERGENCY IN SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER I WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED AND DAVID BELL TO PROVIDE BROADBAND SERVICE. TO MOST CALIFORNIANS AND EMIGRATE TO BE PC THING FOR THE AFFORDABLE IF YOU COULD. LET'S SEE DO YOU THINK HAVE JURISDICTION THE STATE UNIVERSAL LIFELINE PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE TAT ALL CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE. THAT PROGRAM IS WOEFULLY UNDER SUBSCRIBE INSTEAD OF HAVING A THREE PEAT THE FOCUS ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED BY AYE PETE. BUT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON DETERMINING HOW TO IMPROVE UPON THE LIFELINE PROGRAM TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CONSUMER THAT ENTERTAINMENT BENEFITS THAT THANK YOU WELL ACTUALLY I JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT MARKET ENTRY PROGRAM MISSION HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BILL ALSO.

THANK YOU AT CAN YOU PLEASE AND I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR- QUIPTEL AT ADDRESS THIS QUESTION BUT SOMEONE AND ONE OF THE CALLS MENTION- VIOLATION OF TRADE SECRETS SUCH AS WANT TO SEE IF SOMEONE CAN CLARIFY THAT FOR ME. IS THERE ANYWAY I AM VERY GOAL IS THERE ANY WAY THAT SOMEONE CAN ADDRESS OUT WHAT THE I THINK I HEARD OVER THE LIFE ON THE LINE- A VIOLATION OF TRADE SECRETS CAN SOMEONE ADDRESS I JUST TO. CLARIFY THAT COMMENT. THIS IS. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THE SUPPORTER OF THE COMMENT OR A NOT A RESPONSE TO THE COMMENT. IN OPPOSITION MENTIONED THAT THAT SOMEHOW IT VIOLATES TRADE SECRETS AND I JUST WANT SOMEONE- THAT CAN SPEAK TO THE BILL AND HOW THIS. MAY BE THE CASE OR NOT IF THEY CAN CLARIFY THAT FOR ME THANK YOU. THE BIGGER PERHAPS THE DOCTOR POTTER COULD INSURE. AT ACTUALLY THIS IS CHRISTINE MAY YOU FROM TURN I MAYBE ONLY BECAUSE IT IT THE ISSUE IS PREVENTING THE DATA IN FRONT OF THE COMMISSION. AND CARRIERS ARE ROUTINELY CONCERNED AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT PRESENTING- PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. TO THE COMMISSION AND OR POTENTIALLY TO THE PUBLIC AND INVESTMENT DATA CAN BE QUITE SENSITIVE AND SO THERE WOULD JUST NEED TO BE AWAY AND THERE IS PLENTY OF WAYS FOR THE COMMISSION. TO PROTECT THAT INVESTMENT INFORMATION OF THE CARRIERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PRESENTING BUT THE COMMISSION NEEDS THE INVESTMENT INFORMATION UNDERSTAND THE FUTURE OF BROADBAND THE CALIFORNIA- WE TURN SUGGEST THAT DOES NOT TRADE TO GET VIOLATION IS A SOMETHING THAT THE COMMISSION WOULD NEED TO PROTECT THE DATA AS IT. BEING PRESENTED. THANK YOU TOM AND I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING- SENATOR RUBIO THAT THERE IS NO VIOLATION OF- IT'LL- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION- I THINK I ALSO HEARD ANOTHER SPEAKER DISCUSS- THE LIFELINE PROGRAM AND HOW IT'S UNDER UTILIZED THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SET UP TO. TO HELP PEOPLE OF FIVE SOMEONE CAN SPEAK TO- HELD THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT AND BE USED IN A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY VERSUS THE UNDER UTILIZED LIFELINE PROGRAM THAT THEY- I THAT THE OPPOSITION MENTIONED. I COULDN'T REALLY HEAR THE QUESTION I'M SORRY SENATOR RUBIO IF THE MICROPHONE IS THERE ENOUGH THANK YOU ASKED SOMEONE IN THE LIGHT MENTION AND I THINK IT WAS ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE THE MENTION THAT THERE'S A LIFELINE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP ALREADY BUT THAT'S UNDER UTILIZED- IF THERE IS ANY WAY TO JUST MAKE THAT DISTINCTION THIS WILL HELP THAT MANY MORE PEOPLE. I THINK THAT WOULD HELP MORE PEOPLE WOULD WOULD NOT INCREASE THE- THE ACCESS THAT'S NECESSARY THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR ITS THE AFFORDABILITY ASPECT OF IT. AS WELL AS THE BROADBAND ACCESS THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE- BOTH OF THOSE- WITHIN IT SO. I MEAN CERTAINLY MORE PEOPLE USING LIFELINE IS ONE THING BUT- THAT'S NOT GOING TO ENCOURAGE OR HELP THE ISSUE OF BROADBAND ACCESS TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT HAD IT AND DON'T HAVE IT TODAY. THANK YOU FOR A FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND ALSO I DID WANT TO MENTION ON THE OTHER PART THAT THE BILL DOES. OUR PUBLIC REPORTING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FOR THAT ON THE ISSUE. THANK SENATOR. WELL I HAVE A WITNESS UP IN THE GALLERY I'M NOT SURE IF HE WANTS TO. JUST GIVE HIS NAME AND AFFILIATION AND POSITION OR IF HE WANTS TO. RESPOND TO THE SENATOR US AND RUBIO QUESTION. I. IS THE MY PLAN IN THE GALLERY. IDENTIFY YOURSELF. SENATOR OF BURNING A RUST WITH THE COMPANY CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION TO THE TWO ISSUES I WAS PROPOSING TO HAVE A RESPONSE. THAT IS FINE WITH ME THAT'S FINE WITH THE PRISONER SO TO THE ISSUE OF TRADE SECRETS ARE CONFIDENTIALITY. BOB AND INDUSTRY IS A VERY COMPETITIVE COMCAST CHARTER **** AMONG OTHER COMPANIES SO WE HAVE IN COMPETITION WITH FRONTIER EIGHTEEN T. SO TO THE EXTENT OF THIS INFORMATION IS SHARED. WITH OTHER ENTITIES ITS HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL AND IS THAT THAT IS OUR CONCERN AT THIS IS A TRADE SECRETS OF TRACY PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AS A HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION. AND TO THE ISSUE BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT UNDER UTILIZATION OF BROADBAND. LEGISLATION RECENTLY IN THE PAST HAS HAS PROPOSED THAT THE PC OPEN A PROCEEDING TO LOOK AT OF MODIFYING LIFELINE PROGRAM SO THAT HE CAN EXTEND BROADBAND SERVICES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A RIGHT. DOESN'T MEAN FOR WORK. SENATOR HAS SOMEONE IN THE PAST THAT LOOKS AT THE X. OF LIFELINE TO INCLUDE BROADBAND SERVICES I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER OSCO I COULD NOT IDENTIFY YOU. FROM THIS DISTANCE SO I APOLOGIZE. ANY OTHER. FROM MEMBERS OF THE QUE YEAH SENATOR BRADFORD PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION IS A COMMON AND JUST TO PIGGY BACK ON WHAT MISTER ROSS ROSS STATED- BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH LOW INCOME- TELECOM IT BROAD BASE- ISSUES I APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR'S WORK- HERE BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS IT SEEMS TO ME THE BILL IS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON INTERNET PORTABILITY ISSUES FIRST INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS DESERVES SOME CREDIT FOR PROVIDING LOW INCOME PROGRAMS WITHOUT CAPS ON THEIR PARTICIPANTS. BUT THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT ON ITS OWN THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE ASSESSABLE IT IS OFTEN UNCLEAR WHETHER HOUSEHOLD OUT SIR PART WHERE EACH PROGRAMS OR CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE SO I THINK ARE MORE INFORMATION NEEDED BUT THE LACK OF CLARITY ON ITS OWN. IS CALLS FOR CONCERNS ME SECOND THERE'S A LEGITIMATE DEBATE ABOUT HOW FAR IS TOO FAR WHEN IT COMES TO RATES OF STERN SERVICE PROGRAMS THIS REQUIRES. IDENTIFICATION OF AFFORDABLE CLASS OF SERVICE AS DEFINED BY THE P. C. P. YOU SEE. I UNDERSTAND OPPOSITION HAS CONCERT. THIS GOES TOO FAR WHEN A COMBINED WITH PROVISIONS ABOUT NOT RENEWING FRANCHISES SUCH AS DEBORAH AND OUR LICENSE AND SI PC AND- BUT I THINK THERE IS. HERE PINE I'M PROMOTE. THE PRO GOAL OF. SHOULD BE ENSURE BUT AFFORDABLE SERVER PLANTS ARE ACCEPTABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND I TOTALLY SUPPORT THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GO FURTHER. AT OUR RATE READ. OF INTERNET SERVICES TO THE C. C. P. YOU SEE HOW MANY JOBS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY AND I MANY TIMES- FELL INTO COMPLETE THOSE. AND FINALLY I AGREE THAT LIFELINE PROGRAM SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND PROBABLY EXPANDED TO INCLUDE BROADBAND IN FACT I A BILL LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE STARTED THIS PROCESS. THE FCC HAS FAILED WITH THE DELIVERY OF THESE TRANSITION TOWARD BROADBAND BASS LIFELINE SERVICES. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ON. THE AVERAGE SHOULD SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE SO IN A THOUGHTFUL MANNER THAT PROTECTED LEGACY WIRELINE CUSTOMERS WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR PHONE LINES. THIS BILL ARE PROPERLY PROTECTS THOSE CUSTOMERS EVEN WHEN THE FED TO FILL TO SO I HOPE TO CHEER WILL CONTINUE HIS WORK ON THIS ISSUE AS THE BOOK BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I'M HAVE TO SUPPORT THE DAY. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD. ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES WISHING TO SPEAK. OF THEN- I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION SENATOR HILL AND THAT IS THIS SEEMS AT- TO BE OF THE DOMAIN OR JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND I I'M JUST WONDERING WHY ONE STATE WOULD WANT TO. DO SOMETHING UNIQUE ON ITS OWN. WHEN IT'S ALREADY BEING TAKEN CARE OF. YES EIGHT SEVEN. YOU KNOW I EIGHT IT'S IN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR MORE LIKE A YOU KNOW I BELIEVE FROM WHAT WE'VE READ THE RECENT FEDERAL COURT DECISIONS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE FCC DOES NOT HAVE BLANKET PREEMPTION AUTHORITY% ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FCC HAS DECLINED TO SET RULES ON I. S. P.'S REGARDING THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. SO THEY MAY HAVE CERTAINLY PREEMPTION ON OTHER ISSUES AND AREAS THAT WE'VE HAD. CONVERSATIONS UP OVER THE YEARS ON- BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE DON'T BELIEVE IT DOES. THANK YOU. A HEARING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR HILL PLEASE GIVE US YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND- I AM PROUD TO ADD MY NAME IS A CO AUTHOR TO THIS MEASURE BY SENATOR HUESO AND THE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL COLLEGE. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB TEN FIFTY EIGHT BY SENATOR WESSEL TO PASS TO BE AMENDED TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. SENATOR HILL. BY HILL ON MORELAND NO MORE LIKE NO. BRADFORD ALL RIGHT BRADFORD I CHIANG NO CHIANG THEM. DOLLY NO TELLING THEM DODD. DODD I. HERTZBERG MCGUIRE. PAN HI CAN I RUBIO HI RUBIO I. SKINNER BY SKINNER I STERN HI EARN I. WIENER AYE WIENER I. THE DATA UP TO EIGHT DAYS AND THREE KNOWS PASSES A THREE AND WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MISTER GRAVEL YOURS GOOD WORK TODAY AND WELCOME SENATOR JACKSON'S- YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR YOUR BILL SB TEN SIXTY NINE PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M OF LOOKING AT THIS OF A NEW ONE UNLIKE ANY I IN THE PERSPECTIVE ANY OTHER PERSPECTIVE OF FOURTEEN YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE SO HI YA I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS A QUITE AN INTERESTING CHALLENGE. BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I FIRST WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF OF FOR THIS FOR TO EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AND ASSISTANCE- THE- THE BILL AS AMENDED THE AMENDMENTS OF WHICH I. AM ENTHUSIASTICALLY WILL TAKING I THINK REALLY CLARIFY THIS BILL AND- PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS INTENDED. FOR THIS BILL REQUIRES TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REPORT AN INVENTORY OF ITS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. S. DEFINED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS WITH REAL TIME UPDATES DURING EMERGENCIES AND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUTDOWN EVENTS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE TELESCOPE WAS. TO MAKE AVAILABLE IN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS TRAINED OFFICIAL ONE AND HE- SEE AN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER IS SET UP. AND FINALLY IT REQUIRES THAT THEY SURE WITH THE CPUC WHATEVER INFORMATION THEY HAVE ABOUT HOW THEIR NETWORKS PERFORMED WHEN EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS ARE SENT BY EMERGENCY MANAGERS AND SOMETIMES NEVER RECEIVED BY THE PUBLIC. SO THIS BILL A CAME AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE TIME I WAS CHAIRING THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WE TRUST THE HAD THE CAMP EXCUSE ME THE- FIRES IN CINEMA AND THE CAR FIRE- THE I KNOW SENATOR DODD EXPERIENCED- VERY INTENSELY- WHEN THE CAMPFIRE. DEVASTATED PARADISE CALIFORNIA TWENTY EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES WERE DESTROYED OR OUT OF SERVICE LEAVING BOTH RESIDENTS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ON ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. THIS MAKES A DISASTER EVEN MORE A DISASTER WHEN YOU CANNOT FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. THIS PROBLEM WAS THIRTEEN TIMES WORSE. DURING THE SONOMA COUNTY KINCAID FIRE WHICH SHUT DOWN EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR TOWERS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. ALSO IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN P. GENIES PS PS VANCE RESULTED IN NEARLY HALF A MILLION BAY AREA RESIDENTS GOING WITHOUT SHALL VOICE OR INTERNET SERVICES DURING HIGH FIRE DANGER WHETHER. THAT MEANT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SHELLS DOWN IN MARIN COUNTY SENATOR REQUIRES DISTRICT A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN IN SONOMA COUNTY SENATOR MCGUIRE AND SENATOR DODGE DISTRICT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR DOWN AND COST A CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SENATOR DODGE DISTRICT. NINETY SIX IN SAN MATEO COUNTY SENATOR HILL AND SENATOR WINNERS DISTRICT AND ANOTHER EIGHTY NINE IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY AREA SENATOR HILLS DISTRICT AND TOP IT OFF WITH TWENTY FIVE MORE IN NAPA COUNTY SO THAT SENATOR DODD. WAS SUFFERING A CUTE. SO I. THESE WERE DOWN NOW WHILE OF MY COLLEAGUES. OUR INCLUDING THOSE OF YOU HERE TODAY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PUSHED. FOR AND SOME HAVE PASSED IMPORTANT LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE FASTER OUTAGE REPORTING AN INCREASE BACKUP POWER BY INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PRIVATE PROVIDERS THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING INFORMATION SHARING FROM TELCOS TO EMERGENCY MANAGERS IN THREE FUNDAMENTAL WAYS FIRSTLY REQUIRES TELECOM SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REPORT THE LOCATION OF THEIR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AN OPERATING STATUS OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN AS CLOSE TO REAL TIME AS POSSIBLE DURING CRISIS WHY WELL IF THESE IF THESE WARNING FACILITIES GO DOWN. THEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY'VE GOT TO TAKE OTHER STEPS. THE INFORMATION ISN'T COP ISN'T BEING. COMMUNICATED BECAUSE THESE FACILITIES ARE DOWN SO THAT GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE LITERALLY AND I'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN MY OWN BACK DOOR. ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS COMING DOOR TO DOOR TO DOOR TO TELL PEOPLE THEY NEED TO LEAVE. AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO LITERALLY PUT THESE BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND SAVE LIVES. THIS EMERGENCY THIS BILL ALSO GIVES EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO KNOW TO BOTH PLAN AHEAD AND TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO THESE EMERGENCIES SO ARE THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO GIVE THE FIRES UP WERE THOSE TOWERS ARE THEN IT IS REASONABLE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ASSUME THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A BACKUP PLAN. AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL DEVELOP ONCE THEY KNOW WHERE THESE VARIOUS FACILITIES ARE I MIGHT MENTION THAT WE ALSO HAVE A HOPEFULLY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT THESE ARE. OUR TRADE SECRETS OR THAT THERE IS SECURITY CONCERNS BECAUSE WE'VE ADDRESSED THAT AND SAID THAT THE INFORMATION WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE CYBERSECURITY ANOTHER REGULATIONS THAT EXIST BUT THAT THE INFORMATION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THE ONES THAT NEED TO KNOW. IN ORDER SECOND SAVE LIVES SECONDLY. BILL TELCO TO PROVIDE TO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR A RELEVANT LEE TRAIN TELCO OFFICIALS WHO CAN BE REACHED TELEPHONICALLY ARE ASKED TO JOIN THEM. IN THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS MAN'S. HAVING HAVING SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND AS MANY OF YOU HAVE WHEN YOU WERE IN THAT COMMAND CENTER TOGETHER IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION AND TO LEARN WHAT'S GOING ON THAT YOU WILL NOT KNOW OTHERWISE. THE TELCOS HAVE REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS AND WE NEED TO KNOW WE NEED THEIR EXPERTISE IN THAT COMMAND CENTER IN REAL TIME WHEN THESE EVENTS ARE OCCURRING AND THIRDLY THIS MEASURE REQUIRES THE TELCOS TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHETHER EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS ARE GOING THROUGH THEIR NETWORKS. SINCE WE'VE SEEN ALL TOO DEVASTATINGLY. WHEN THE SCRIPT DON'T GO THROUGH DUE TO WIN OUTAGE OF DAMAGED EQUIPMENT THE PEOPLE ARE NOT GIVEN THOSE WARNINGS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE AND BLOCKED AID THAT GET THE NOTICE AND PEOPLE IN BLOCK B. THE DON'T. AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHY AND WHEN AND THAT IS THE THIRD PART OF THIS BILL AND AGAIN- THIS IS A BATTERY SAVING LIVES. WE WORKED WITH. THE OPPOSITION. I THINK THE AS I MENTIONED AMENDMENTS I THINK ARE ARE EXCELLENT AND WILL HELP US GET TO THIS POINT- AGAIN WE REALLY DO NEED TO- MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THESE URGENCY IS HAPPENED WHEN PSP ESSES OCCUR. THAT WE ARE ON THE BALL AND THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I NEED THE CAR TO BE A PARTNER AT BEST THAT'S WHAT THIS DOES AND WE THAT I WOULD RISK. I FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SIR CHECK. DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS THE TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS- WE WILL INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. ACCORDINGLY EACH SIDE WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES. AND THEN ALL THOSE WISHING TO TESTIFY AS SUPPORTERS. MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE I UNDERSTAND SENATOR JACKSON GOT TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THAT IS CORRECT PATRICK MADE ART AND- UNIVERSE OF MOON DOES- IF- MISTER MINARD IS- ON THE LINE PLEASE BEGIN. AND NOT HEARING MISTER MAYNARD WILL GO TO MISTER. UNIVERSE MOONDANCE. IF YOU ARE ON HE LINE PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. I THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MIX UP HERE BUT I CAN TELL YOU MISTER MAYNARD IS FROM THE VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE MORE CLOSELY WITH HIM ON THIS MEASURE- TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE DURING THE NUMEROUS WILDFIRES. THAT OF INTER COUNTY AND MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR STERN AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT FAR TO GREAT LENGTH AND MISTER MUNEER ROSE. UP FROM THE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGAIN.

WE WILL OF WAITED TO GO TO THE- OTHERS THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN SIXTY NINE AND WE WILL GO BACK TO YOUR WITNESSES TO SEE IF THEY- TO APPEAR IN THE- AS SOON AS A- SEVEN OPEN MIND AT THIS TIME YOU COULD GO.

LOW PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS LIKE MYSELF CAN ACT QUICKLY AND CONFIDENTLY. AND INITIATE ANY PROTECTIVE ACTION TO ENSURE THE COMMUNITY IS PROPRLY INFORMED. ON THE NOTED IMPACT- KEEP PRINCIPLE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IS A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTING OF ALL POTENTIAL IMPACT. INCLUDING IMPACTED CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

VERY GOOD THANK YOU A MODERATE COULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THE LINE ONCE AGAIN JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL OF THE SUPPORT WITNESSES FOR. ARTS SUPPORTERS OF SB TEN SIXTY NINE. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE- IN Q. FOUR SUPPORT IT'S ONE ZERO. WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATE OR NOT WE WILL NOW TURN TO THOSE IN OPPOSITION. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- BERNIE ROSCOE AND STEVE CARLSON MISTER OSCO I SEE YOU IN THE GALLERY PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BERMAN ROSTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. BUT WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB TEN SIXTY NINE BECAUSE IT WOULD MANDATE UNNECESSARY REPORTS THAT WE ALREADY GENERATE TODAY- THE KEY SITUATIONAL UNDERSTANDING AMERICAN SEE SITUATIONS AS AT THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT. PROVIDES THAT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IT IS A LEAD STATE AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL COORDINATE ALL ACTIVITIES ARE DONE STATE AND LOCAL. AND THEY WILL COORDINATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATE. THIS BILL LOOKS TO- ADD SECTIONS IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE SECTION THAT ALREADY EXIST TODAY IN THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE. TO KEY PIECES THE LETTER RECENTLY WERE ADOPTED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THE FIRST BEING SB EIGHT THREE THREE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SB EIGHT THREE THREE LOOKED AT THE SITUATIONS OF EMERGENCIES AND FALL SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF HOW ISSUE HOW EMERGENCY ALERTS WERE ISSUED. THE IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT EMERGENCY ALERTS AS WE ARE THE PLATFORM FOR SENDING THOSE ALERTS THROUGH. THE ALERTS ARE GENERATED BY GOVERNMENT. THEY AND ALL THE CONTENT IS FROM GOVERNMENT CAN YOU THE GOVERNMENT WILL DICTATE WHEN AND YOU IF AND WHEN YOU WILL SEND THOSE ALERTS. SO THE POINT ABOUT STATUS ALERTS AGO AT. THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTRACT WITH THIRD PARTY VENDORS TO DO REVERSE NINE ONE ONE CALLS. THOSE ARE GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED WROBEL. THERE ARE. THE MAIN AND PHONE OR CLAIM BY LOCAL. PUT INTO THE MACHINE AND THEN THOSE ALERTS WILL GO OUT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ISSUES THOSE ALERTS. THOSE WORDS MAY GO TO A CELL PHONE AND MAY GO TO A COPPER LANDLINE OR MAY GO TO AVOID SERVICE. BUT THE ONLY ENTITY IN THIS CHAIN THAT HAS ALL THAT INFORMATION IS A THIRD PARTY ROLL CALL. IN ADDITION-LAST YEAR SENATE MCGUIRE HAD SB SIX SEVENTY. THE PURPOSE OF THAT BILL WAS TO PROVIDE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHEN OUR NETWORKS THROUGHOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROVIDE A NETWORK ALEX REPORT. TO TELL- YES THE ANALYSIS APPROPRIATE CALLS OUT THEIR CODE SECTION IN YOUR SECOND BULLARD OF EXISTING LAW BUT WHAT IT FAILED TO. NO WAS IN ADDITION TO TALKING THAT INFORMATION ABOUT NETWORK AVERAGES FOR SITUATION AWARENESS DURING A DISASTER. THERE'S ALSO THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO. NOTIFY ANY APPLICABLE COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE SHERIFF OF ANY COUNTY AND ANY PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS ABOUT THE ELDERS. THAT REQUIREMENT IS ALREADY THERE AND STATUTES IN LAW IT'S AS PART OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT. SO IN THE RESPONSE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE FACT EMERGENCY THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT ALSO REQUIRES CAL- YES WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. OF A DISASTER TO PREPARE A REPORT TO BE SURE WITH ALL PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES ON HOW WELL THE ENTITIES RESPONDED TO THE DISASTERS AND WHAT ISSUES THAT THEY DEAL WITH. SO AS FAR AS AS WE TRANSITION TIME THE FINAL IS UNNECESSARY. THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WILL DO NOTHING TO CHANGE OUR POSITION. THIS THIS BILL IS REDUNDANT. AND UNANSWERED. UNNECESSARY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR US GROW AND HAVE YOU THE THREE MINUTES OF TIME AND THE- PROBABLY WORKS UP IS MISTER CARLSON HAS NOT ABLE TO GET TO CALL IN SO WE WILL NOW LOOK FOR ANYONE- ANY.

TIES AND FUNDS THROUGH THE SPELL SO MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN THIRTY WHICH IS A CRITICAL MEASURE TO HELP CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC A LACK ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET WAS AN ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITIES EVEN FOR THIS PANDEMIC TOOK HOLD THE NEED FOR MODERN AND STRUCTURE FUTURE PROOF AND SHIP INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN GREATLY AND- WITH. THE MOVEMENT OF HEALTH CARE WORK DISTANCE LEARNING AND EDUCATION. AND ONLINE PLATFORMS IN RESPONSE TO COPE IN NINETEEN. ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE SEEING EXAMPLES OF HOW THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS PREVENTING CALIFORNIANS FROM ENGAGING IN CRITICAL DIGITAL ACTIVITIES. WHETHER IT BE STUDENTS HAVING TO USE THIS PARKING LOT- TO OBTAIN. ACCESS TO WIFI CONNECTIONS TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK OR OLDER CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE FAST ENOUGH. INTERNET TO RECEIVE TELEHEALTH SERVICES OR TO CONNECT WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN ALL PARTS OF OUR STATE. OF THE COUNTRIES HAVE FOR TECHNOLOGY AND THE FIFTH LARGEST STATE THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE AND WE CAN DO MUST MUCH BETTER. A LACK TERM INVESTMENT IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY READY BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES IS A KEY DRIVER OF THE EXISTING DIGITAL DIVIDE SB ELEVEN THIRTY WILL BEGIN TO PROVIDE THE INVESTMENT NEEDED. TO BUILD FIBER CONNECTIVITY TO EVERY HOME SCHOOL AND BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REDEFINED THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCES. ADVANCED SERVICES FUND TO ENABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THAT REPLACE OUTDATED INTERNET SPEEDS IN UNSERVED AREAS THIS CHANGE IN CRITERIO UNABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNET. PROVIDERS OF ALSO. TO APPLY FOR GRANTS AND AT THE SAME TIME INVEST IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT CAN MEET CALIFORNIANS EVERY DAY NEEDS. THROUGH OPEN THE PROGRAM'S. CURRENTLY THE DOUBLE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA SERVICES FUND ARE TIED DIRECTLY TO LOW INTERNET SPEEDS SIX DOWNLOAD ONE UPLOAD. MAKING IN IT AT. LIKE SB IN BUDGET WILL. TO NOTE THERE IS OVER THREE MILLION SITTING IN THE FUN THAT TO BE LEVERAGE FROM VARIOUS OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS AND SOURCES SB ELEVEN THIRTY WILL ALLOW THE PC TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO FINANCE OPEN ACCESS HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THESE CHANGES WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA PAR WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THIS MEASURE PROVIDE A SOLUTION CHRONIC INTERNET ISSUES AND RURAL URBAN RIVAL AND SUBURBAN IS RATHER EIGHT. NO HE WILL BE LEFT WE SIMPLY EXPECT MORE AT ELEVEN THIRTY DOES NOT PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS SIMPLY ENABLES GRANTS AWARDED BASED ON INTERNET ACCESS AND SPEEDS NOT GEOGRAPHY. 149% OF RURAL HOMES WITH SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN HAVE BROADBAND AND LOS ANGELES ONE QUARTER OVER ALMOST THREE MILLION STUDENTS TO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AT HOME CURRENTLY LIVE IN THAT IN THAT IN BY. THEN OKAY IT REALLY ONE THIRD. URBAN DISTRICT MINE. AND REPORT THIS THAT MY COLLEAGUES REFERS.

OVER BOBBI SYSTEMS THESE ALL NEED ADEQUATE DOWNLOAD AND UPLOAD SPEED THAT LEGACY NETWORKS ARE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE NOR EVER WILL PROVIDE. SB ELEVEN THIRTY BEGIN THE PROCESS OF FIXING MANY BE A LONG TERM FIX THESE PROBLEMS COULD BE MAKING IT HIGHLIGHTS WITH A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE. PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON FIBER. FIBER WILL BE KEY TO. MANY OF THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THEY CAN IS THE INGREDIENT FOUR INCH. OUR FUTURE PROOF NETWORK- FIBER THE UNIVERSE AND GREEN FOR- THAT THE FUTURE OF THINGS LIKE SPACEX THAT'LL CONNECTION FIVE G. EXPIRATION WIFI. GIGABIT BROADBAND NETWORKS ALL OF THESE REQUIRE FIBER INFRASTRUCTURE. ACCORDING IN SUPER SO FULL UPPER LOCAL SELF RELIANCE A NONPROFIT FOCUSED ON GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS CAN GET YOU TWELVE MILES TWELVE MILES TO PORTLAND ROAD FIFTEEN MILES OF WATER PIPES OR DOZENS UPON DOZENS OF MILES OF FIBER OPTICS. SB ELEVEN THIRTY CHANGES SEEK- TO REFLECT ADVANCEMENTS IN BROADBAND THAT OCCURRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. IT IS A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY FIVE ON THAT ONE SURE ABOUT THE CLOSE TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT DO NOT HAVE. BROADBAND ACCESS WILL BE PART OF ANY STATE INFRASTRUCTURE EFFORT. AND THIS IS CRITICAL GIVEN THAT SCALE AN AGGREGATION OF THE DEMAND FOR HIGH SPEED ACCESS WHICH IS ONLY GROWN OVER TIME- CAN BE PART OF ANY SORT OF LONG TERM FINANCING AFTER BY THE STATE. THAT WILL ATTRACT ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL TO MATCH ANY STATE EFFORT HERE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW BUT ANY MARKET BETTY HI CABLE BROADBAND SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPDATED IT WILL BE ON TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE TODAY TO THIS WILL NOT FINANCE NETWORKS. IN ANY MARKET WHERE A CABLE COMPANY HAD AGREED TO WHAT'S CALLED DOCKET THREE POINT ONE WHICH IS OCCURRED ACCORDING TO THE- CABLE INDUSTRY DON'T PRESS RELEASES MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. AND LASTLY IT DOC THE DEFINITION OF ON SERVICE- FOR HIGH POVERTY AREAS. MAINLY FOCUSING ON LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS. BUILD THOSE ACCORDING TO FEDERAL DATA ALSO LACK BROADBAND ACCESS AS MUCH AS ANY OF RULE MARKET. AND LASTLY BECAUSE THIS IS FOCUSED ON FIBER INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHICH IS IN A PROJECTOR WITH EXTREME CAPACITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ASSET. ON AN AVERAGE ESTIMATE WILL BE USEFUL FOR BROADBAND APPROVED FOR SEVENTY YEARS AFTER CONSTRUCTION. THAT MADE ANY TO SPEAK FINANCE PROJECT.

THAT'S CORRECT THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THINKING OF VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE WILL MOVE TO THE OPPOSITION AND I UNDERSTAND THERE IS ONE SPEAKER IN OPPOSITION. AND ISSUES ON THE CALL CAROLYN MCINTYRE. THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I CAROLINE MCINTYRE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BELL AND FIRST LET ME BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO SB ELEVEN THIRTY BECAUSE OF THE TWENTY FIVE THREE AS AMENDED SPEED REQUIREMENTS AB ONE OF THE SUPPORTING WITNESSES POINTED OUT ALL OF OUR NETWORK. EITHER MEET OR OPEN FAR EXCEED THOSE. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED EVERYTHING'S FINE HAD EIGHT REMAKE PURSUANT TO LEGISLATION THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WERE MADE AVAILABLE. FOR DEPLOYING BROADBAND INTO UNSERVED AREAS I WILL NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND SO THIS IS THE SECOND POT OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION. THAT HAVE IN FACT BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE I BROADBAND INTERNET WILL AREAS. PROBLEM WITH THE BILL IS THAT BY EXPANDING THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT TO INCLUDE AREAS THAT HAVE BE GREATER THAN SIX ONE. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO THE- BROUGHT IN THE AREAS THAT HAVE NOT. IT IS A PRIORITIZE THE POWER OF THE STATE CALIFORNIA TO TRY AND GET ALL INDIVIDUALS SOME FORM THAT CAN ACTIVITY BEFORE EXPANDING THE PROGRAM TO ALLOW FOR FUNDING AND AFTER AREA. THE CBC RECENTLY RECIEVED FIFTY TWO APPLICATIONS FOR THEIR CALIFORNIA SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. IF ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WERE TO BE HANDED OUT ALL. THE APPLICATIONS WERE TO BE FUNDED. EIGHT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO DO SOUTH THAT PROGRAM IS A- CURRENTLY ONLY HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS BILL OFFERS NO NEW SPENDING. SO IT WOULD AGAIN REQUIRED THE STATE TO. ATTEMPT PRIORITIZE WHAT PROGRAMS NOW MEANING A LARGER AREA WITHIN TWENTY FIVE AND THREE THERE AGAIN I'M LEAVING THE AREAS THAT HAVE NO BROADBAND ACCESS AT ALL. SO A NUMBER MANY PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR THE SPENDING AND MIDDLE MILE AND PORTIONS OF THE NETWORK UNDER CURRENT LAN. MALE MALE CAN ONLY BE OFFENDED IF IN FACT IT IS CAN PROVIDE SOME LAST MILE RESIDENTIAL CAN ACTIVITY. HE ENDED HERE A LOT OF THE CPC TO PROVIDE LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN NOT PAID UPGRADE THEIR OWN NETWORK WHICH I WOULD SUGGEST WOULD CALL INTO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN AFFORD TO OPERATE A NETWORK. SO THIS BILL HAD MANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT AND IN ITS EFFORT TO FUTURE PROOF. WOODS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED ANYMORE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK BUT THE PRIMARY. PROBLEM HERE IS THE FACT THAT KNOWS RULE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND EVEN THOUGH THE BILL THAT AND MANDATE TO SAY THAT CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND WE ARE NO CLOSER TO GETTING THEM FOR CAN ACTIVITIES AND WE WERE IN THIS PROGRAM BEGAN. LOS RECENTLY OPPOSE ABOUT. HER THANK YOU ENTIRE IS THERE. ANYONE IN THE GALLERY WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY SEEING NO ONE IN THEIR ANYONE INTENT ROOM TEN FOUR TWENTY FORTY. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN THIRTY NO ONE THERE AS WELL.

THANK YOU MISTER-CHAIR OF THE GOALS OF THIS BILL ARE TRULY COMMENDABLE OF ALTHOUGH I'VE HAD CONCERNS SIMILAR TO THOSE RAISED BY. THE OPPOSITION. AXIS IS SUFFICIENT ROBIN IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TODAY WHERE STUDENTS ARE. EDUCATED THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING AND WORK IS BEING DONE WITH VIDEO CONFERENCING LIKE ZOOM AND I'M SURE WE'VE ALL DONE ON A MILLION OF THOSE. BECAUSE I'M VERY GLAD THAT YOU'LL BE ACCEPTING THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AND FOR THE RATE THAT REASON I WILL BE SUPPORTING TODAY- I DO HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THEY- MAY STILL HAVE MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CHANGE SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I. FIRST WANT TO SAY I HAVE THE- A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR SHE- DID HER WORK SHE CALLED IN. AND TALKED TO ME ABOUT HER BILL AND I KNOW HAS TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS TO. TRY TO MAKE THE BILL OF MORE- THE POSSIBLE FOR RULE COMMITTEES BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO. BACK UP AND CHECK AB EIGHT SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WAS A BILL THAT ACTUALLY THAT TO. THIS MCINTYRE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT WHICH WAS I WAS A JOINT AUTHORED ON THAT BILL WITH THE EDUARDO GARCIA AND SOME OTHERS IN IN A COUPLE YEARS BACK IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT WAS AT THE TIME WHEN THE FUNDS WERE ACTUALLY GONNA GO AWAY. AND WITHOUT THAT BILL WE EXTENDED THE PROGRAM AND ALLOW THOSE FUNDS TO ACCRUE- SO. AT THE TIME I WAS A REPRESENTING ASSEMBLY DISTRICT NUMBER ONE WHICH WAS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES AND THE REASON YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE MANY PEOPLE CALL ME OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE THEY STILL DON'T HAVE INTERNET AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE A PHONE SO THEY CAN'T REALLY GET INVOLVED. GOVERNMENT AND OUR GOAL WAS. YES POSSIBLE OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THOSE AREAS THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET AT LEAST SIX UP AND ONE DAY AFTER ONE ONE SIX AND SO. WE HAVE A HELL HECK OF A LOT OF- APPLICANTS THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN ACCRUING FOR SOME TIME AND WORSE JUST STARTING TO SEE THE PROCESS NOW FOR WE CAN GET. THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT I HAVE TRULY BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND I AND ONE OF THE- TESTIMONIES THAT WE HELD DURING THE PROCESS OF AB SIXTY SIXTY FIVE WAS. I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO ANYWHERE IN IN A IN A POPULATED DISTRICT AND I BET YOU I CAN TURN MYSELF ON ON AND GET BETTER SERVICE THAN I GET MY HOME RIGHT NOW TODAY. AND SO. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE I KNOW MISTER MCGUIRE REPRESENTS IS. A TON OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. MR DOT HAS SOME OF THOSE AS WELL. IN HIS DISTRICT- BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND. THE THIS TWENTY FIVE AND THREE HE- IS GOING TO DELETE UP THE FUNDS THAT THEY WILL THEY JUST. THEY'RE THEY'RE IT'S- EXPENSIVE TO GET OUT OF THOSE RULERS AND THAT'S WHY WE EXTENDED THE FUN SO. I WOULD LIKE TO WAIT A FEW YEARS AND TRY TO GET. THOSE APPLICATIONS FUNDED IN THOSE AREAS SO WE CAN SEE THOSE COMMUNITIES.

COMMEND THE AUTHOR ON HER DILIGENCE ON THIS MATTER I. YOU KNOW I. OFTEN THOUGHT THIS WAS. SOLELY A RURAL ISSUE. THIS CALL. CRISIS THE BODIES IN OUR AREAS WERE JUST MAG AND LAID TO BEAR YOU KNOW WE HAD SOME SOME SOLID RESPONSES FRANKLY FROM INDUSTRY AND YEAH I WANT TO PARTICULARLY MENTIONED SPECTRUM CHARTER WHEN THEY STEPPED UP WITH LAUSD AND- STARTED OFFERING THAT'S I THINK IT'S SIXTY DAYS OF. OF FREE INTERNET FREE INTERNET AND A HOOK UP TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS. CONNECTIVITY CRISIS WITH THOSE KINDS OF GESTURES ALONE IN THE VISIONARY NATURE THIS BILL. TRY DOING ASSUME CALL ON TEN YOU KNOW TEN AT SIX DOWN RIGHT TRIED TRY DOING TRY FINDING SOME WAY TO TAP INTO YOUR- YOUR CLASSROOM AND HAVE AN INTERACTIVE VIDEO CONFERENCE- I GET THE WE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE AND I WANT TO START SEEN AS MAKE PROGRESS IN THOSE EARLY. YEARS BUT- I SEE THIS AS IT AS MUCH AS A VISION STATEMENT AS ANYTHING OF WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO HEAD. AND THAT HUNDRED TARGETING THAT FUTURE PROOF. IS FRANKLY THE ONLY DIRECTION WE CAN HEAD WITHOUT STRAINING A BUNCH ASSETS AROUND THE STATE THAT FRANK THE PEOPLE CAN UTILIZE IF. IF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GONNA LEARN IN THIS STRANGE NEW YEAR SO AT THEAPPROPRIATE TIME I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR. AND HELP IN THIS EFFORT. SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE WORK FROM CENTER OF FROM CENTER TO THE NORTH AS WELL AS- A SIMILAR GARCIA THIS EFFORT BUT- NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO LET UP I FRANKLY THINK WE NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMON SENATOR STERN AND A SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR ACTING CHAIR. OUR SUPPORT HI THIS BILL I WAS PROUD TO SUPPORT IT WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS AS WELL- AND I WANT TO REITERATE WHAT CENTER STERN- I SAID THAT COOLEY I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING SURE WE CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN OUR RURAL AREAS IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HAS MAJOR. EQUITY ECONOMIC HEALTH PUBLIC SAFETY. RAMIFICATIONS BUT I THINK SOMETIMES THERE IS A- PERCEPTION THAT WELL IF YOU'RE IN A CITY OR TESTIFYING AND WE KNOW THAT IN OUR CITIES WHETHER IT'S- SAN FRANCISCO. OR LA SAN FRANCISCO IS PERCEIVED AS A VERY WEALTHY CITY WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT POVERTY IN OUR CITY. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO REALLY STRUGGLE. WITH DIGITAL ACCESS SO IT IS. IT IS A HUGE WORLD ISSUE BUT IS A HUGE URBAN ISSUE AS WELL- AND BECAUSE OF THE TO SEARCH YOUR NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING. IN POVERTY IN OUR CITIES THAT AFFECTS AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE- AND HAS LIFELONG RAMIFICATIONS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT ACCESS EARLY- AND CONSISTENTLY BUT I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL. SENATOR WIENER SENATOR MORE UP SURE- MAYBE I'M A LITTLE OLD FASHIONED BUT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WAS INVOLVED WITH THE SUMMER CAMP AND IT'S A- ON THE WAY TO. BIG BEAR LAKE ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT ROADS TO GO UP TO. BIG BEAR LAKE IN THIS WAS HIGHWAY THIRTY EIGHT OUT OF MEN TONE. AND WE HAD NO ELECTRICITY THERE WASN'T A LINE THAT CAME ALL THE WAY FOR ALL THOSE SUMMER CAMPS IN HOMES- WOULD HAVE TO GENERATE THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY. IT WAS SO WE DID THAT FOR THE LONGEST TIME BUT NEVER THOUGHT THAT OUR NEIGHBORS SHOULD ALL. CHIP IN AND SUBSIDIZE UP ONLINE. IT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO OUR FRONT GATE AND THEN HAVE US ENJOY ELECTRICITY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. SO I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS BILL IN AND FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT AN INDUSTRY THAT. PROVIDES DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND WORKS FOR YEARS TO GET EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE AND NOW THERE ARE SOME THAT. AREN'T ONLINE FOR WHATEVER PARTICULAR REASON AND NOW THERE'S SOME KIND OF ENTITLEMENT. WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL THOSE THAT ARE USING THE SERVICE NOW HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE THE ABILITY FOR OTHERS. TO GET IT SO IT'S SORT OF MORPHED INTO SOMETHING ELSE SO I. I'M HAVING A LITTLE DIFFICULTY WITH WITH THAT IDEA THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE. HAS TO SUPPORT FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE FIRST. AND IN AND OUT UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING I'M JUST HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THAT CONCEPT SO JUST NOT A QUESTION JUSTIFIED IT MAYBE THE AUTHOR COULD. HELP ME IN HER CLOSING REMARKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- ACTION RIGHT FOR. THANK YOU AND I TO WANT TO COMMEND AUTHOR FOR HER EFFORTS IN THIS AREA BUT- HI TO HAPPEN CHALLENGES WITH THIS AS STATED. A FEW YEARS AGO I DID A BILL ARE IN REGARDS TO TRYING TO. BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND OUR PUBLIC HOUSING- SECTOR USE IN CA S. OFF AND ON I'M- I THINK IT BEST THERE'S MIXED REVIEWS ON THE SUCCESS OF THAT PROGRAM AND THAT'S WERE MY GREATEST CONCERN IS NOT AND- TARGETING THOSE AREAS BUT MAKING URE THOSE DOLLARS ARE USED EFFECTIVELY- NOT ALL HOMES NEED FIBER BUT THEY ALL DESERVE MORE THAN DSL FOR SURE. AND IN AREAS SUCH AS- ARE SENATOR FROM ON THE FIRSTDISTRICT I MEAN THEY NEED. CONNECTIVITY BASIC CONNECTIVITY SERVICE AND- BUT THE LACK OF DIGITAL SERVICES NOT JUST A REAL ISSUE IT'S A URBAN ISSUE AS WELL AS I STATED AS- WE TRY TO ADDRESS AND MUCH OF OUR- PUBLIC HOUSING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WE ALL KNOW- THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS. BASED ON TWO FACTORS ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY SO. I WOULD HOLD. WE WOULD FOCUS OUR CHALLENGES ON THERE I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I AM REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE HAVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF THESE FUNDS GOING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT WE REALLY DRAW DOWN AND- REACH TO COMMUNITIES THAT.

FOR HIS WORK ON THIS AND EXPERTISE TO HAVE HER ATTENTION TO THIS LEGISLATION THEY SPEND AN AWFUL A LOT OF TIME ON THIS WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL AND OF COURSE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEES AND THEN IT'S NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS TODAY MISTER CHAIR HOUSE ONE TAKE AMONG THE STATE THANK YOU TO SENATOR STERN FIRST PARTNERSHIP ON THIS BILL IS A JOINT AUTHORED. SB THIRTEEN TWELVE TAKES CRUCIAL STEPS CRUCIAL STEPS TO ENSURE THE UTILITY POWER SHUT OFF EVENTS HAVE SMALLER FOOTPRINTS THIS YEAR SHORTER DURATIONS AND PROPER OVERSIGHT IN DOING SO IT REQUIRES INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES PART TO PRIORITIZE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WELL AS A POLL THE BELIEF THAT CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO RELIABLE ELECTRICAL SERVICE IN THIS DAY AND AGE BY THE WAY WERE IN TWENTY TWENTY. LAST YEAR BROUGHT AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF POWER SHUT OFF OF IN SPITE UTILITIES ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE P. JEANNIE SERVICE TERRITORY CUTTING CALIFORNIANS TO WONDER IF THE NEW NORMAL BE A LACK OF POWER FOR DAYS OR EVEN WEEKS ON END. GAINING IN SEPTEMBER OVER TWO MILLION RESIDENTS LOST POWER ACROSS FORTY COUNTIES SHUT OFF A VINCE OCCURRED WITH SUCH FREQUENCY THAT THEY BLED INTO EACH OTHER AS THE INTERNET I WOULD. MEAN RESIDENTS WITHOUT POWER OF FORTY DAYS IN A THIRTY DAY. ITALY P. JEANNIE IN PARTICULAR MUST DO BETTER. CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION REQUIRES- UTILITIES TO FILL OUT REPORTS AFTER POWER SHUT OFF OF THESE. THESE REPORTS HOWEVER OFTEN LACKEY INFORMATION IMPROPER REVIEW. ADDED THE DOZENS OF REPORTS FILED LAST FALL THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DIDN'T DO THREE HEARINGS NOT TO. THEY ONLY DID ONE OFFICIAL REVIEW ANY HEARING. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR CALIFORNIANS OUR STATE LACKS A FORMAL PROCESS FOR FUTURE REVIEWS OF SHUT OFF EVENTS IN CLEARLY THE LEVEL REVIEW WITHOUT ONE HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT AT BEST. SB THIRTEEN TWELVE PROVIDES THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK TO DECREASE THE FREQUENCY OF POWER SHUT OFF OF INS AND ALTERNATELY ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE THEIR USE BY REQUIRING INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES YOU TAKE BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM STEPS TO HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. AS WELL AS MODERNIZE IS WELL. SO HERE'S WHAT IT DOES NUMBER ONE IT AUTHORIZES THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES CALIFORNIA AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONTO CREATE CONSISTENT PROCEDURES FOR POWER SHUT OFF OVENS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIANS. HERE'S WHAT THIS MEANS ALL THREE OF THESE AGENCIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON WHAT THE NEED NOW IT MAKES SOME COME TOGETHER IN COLLABORATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE TYPE OF NOTIFICATION IS A NEED. WHEN THE- HOW ALL DO UTILITY REPAIRALE. WHAT FOOT PRINT IS GOING TO BE INSURING THAT ALL THE AGENCIES THAT ARE INTACT. BY THESE UTILITIES. INDIGO RIGHT IS REQUIRED COLLABORATE. NUMBER EVERY WHAT I TO IDENTIFY POWER LINES ARE MORE LIKELY TO CAUSE POWER SHUT OFF A VINCE OR WILDFIRES IT PROHIBITS THE IOUS FROM CHARGING CALIFORNIA. OR ELECTRICITY NOT BY THE- IN A- WHEN THE POWER IS CUT REQUIRE SIDE USED TO INCLUDE DETAIL ABOUT THE LAW. AT CAR THE POWERSHOT OFF OF THE THIS IS. IN THERE AFTER EVENT REPORTS HOW MANY MILES A LINE WERE IMPACTED OR HOW MANY CIRCUITS ARE IMPACTED IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT INFORMATION DOWN THE DETAIL AND THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED. THIS WILL ALLOW STATE AGENCY TO TRULY CAN IT WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE WITHIN THE GREAT INDEED SELECT AT ABOUT A FIX IT PLAN. IT ALSO REQUIRES. THE WHOLE HERE. TO WHETHER A POWER CHARLOTTE IN IS IN COURT. WITH STANDARD. IN AUTHORIZED TO LEVY FINES IF NEEDED AFTER EVERY POWER SHUT OFF. AFTER EVERYONE OF THEM. IF CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING TO BE IN PAIN. AND SURE ENOUGH THE REGULATOR SHOULD BE IN PAIN LISTENING TO WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE OF CALIFORNIANS ON A DAILY BASIS. IT ALSO REQUIRES A USER HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAUSES THE POWERSHOT OF A VENN. REPORT BACK TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON AGGRESSIVE ONE AFTER THE SHUT OFF OF. RIGHT NOW UTILITIES ARE BEHIND BEHIND YEARS IN THERE HER NAME AND EDUCATION MANAGEMENT ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE- PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC- TERM. LASTLY THIS BILL WILL NOT BY THE EXISTING UNDERGROUND INSTAGRAM AT THE UTILITY COMMISSION. THE PULL OUT IS IN HIGH RISK FOR HIS. IT'S RIGHT. WHILE YOUR FEET THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE FIRST THE FIRE CHIEF SALINAS IT CAN'T THE AND SO SHE ASSOCIATION AND THE REASON BEING EACH ONE OF THESE AGENCIES EACH ONE OF THESE AGENCIES HAVE TO RESPOND ESPECIALLY IN THE P. JEANNIE TO SPUR SURGERY AS THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ARE YOU USING FOR CO WORKERS ON THE- BUDGET AND THEY'LL- WE WANT TO SAY THANK. BUSINESS HERE ENGAGE. WITH MADE IN IMMENSE LAST WEEK TO ADDRESSSEVERAL CONCERNS MOST NOTABLY MAKING SURE THAT SB THIRTEEN TWELVE TWELVE. ALIGNS RATE OF RETURN WHAT AB TEN FIFTY FOUR IT WAS REALLY CRITICAL AND IT MADE SENSE. AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ARE BILL. OUR GOAL IT'S NEVER TO THROW THE EXISTING C. P. C. PROCESS OUT. BUT THE BILL IN AREAS WHERE WE START GAP LAST FALL IN IN THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS. SB THIRTEEN TWELVE PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT SHUT OFF OF VINCE BECOME THE TOOL OF LAST RESORT. AND NOT THE DEFAULT STRATEGY. BUYERS NOW HERE WE CAN ANTICIPATE A NUMBER OF POWER SHUT OFF THE VINCE AND IT'S GONNA BE SOON. THE FATE AS FAR. SO MY- TIONS WITHIN THE PEACH. THIRTY GOING FORWARD HOWEVER WE CANNOT LEAVE COMPANIES IN THE- I HAVE TO DO IT TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TONY GOZER A FIRE CHIEF FOR THE GREAT CITY CENTER.

A AND- MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS ARE OPPOSITION IS RIDLEY DOWN TO ONE. BUT VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE WHICH HAS TO DO WITH CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW METRIC OF REPORTING. AND OF HARDENING OF TREES MISSION IN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. MEMBERS JUST LAST YEAR WE PASSED AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WE CREATED A WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION CHARTER. WITH PERCY THE PROGRESS IN THE PLANNING OF. PARDON THIS IS THE OF THE- INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CREATED A WHAT ARE SIX. MORE TO BY FIRST PROGRESS OF THAT TYPE OF WAR. WE ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THE ARBITRARY TIME FRAMES PLACED ON THIS VERY COMPLEX AND DANGEROUS WORK IS GOING TO ENDANGER THE LIVES OF OUR MEMBERS BY FORCING CONTRACTORS UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE UTILITIES TO WORK TO GET THINGS DONE FASTER THAN IN AND WITH WITH OUT. FALLING ALL THE SAFETY MEASURES THE SERVER SECTOR. MEMBERS OF THE NEW IS TO OCCUPATION SAFETY AND HEALTH UTILITY LINE WORK IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST PROFESSIONS WITH FIFTY SIX POINT THREE DEATHS.

YES SENATOR HERTZBERG. BERMAN IT'S NICE TO SEE HIM STRETCH SENATOR TO BURKE THANK YOU HEY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATE YES SENATOR BRADFORD. YOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ALL IT'S HARD WORK ON IN THIS ON THIS EFFORT BUT- I AM REALLY TORN HERE BECAUSE- PUBLIC SAFETY IS A PRIORITY OF EACH AND EVERYONE OF US ARE HERE AND IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AS WELL AS TO UTILITIES TO RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING SERVICES. BUT IT TOO NOW BURDEN THE UTILITY. WITH ACTION YOUR BARRIERS AND- REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT WAS THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TWO YEARS AGO. THE U. S. B. NINE OH ONE THAT REQUIRED HER TO UTILITIES TO DO NOW WHAT THEY'RE BEING CRITICIZED FOR DOING. WE ASK OUR SHUT OFFS WE ASKED FOR POWER SHOT UPS TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY HAVE NOW TRULY I THINK OUR FOCUS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BUT WE ASKED TO FOCUS ON POWER SHUT OFFS AND NOT TO UTILITIES HAVE DONE. AND NOW TO NOW LIES DOWN FOR DOING WHAT WE ASK THEM TO DO NOT A SINGLE I OWE YOU OR- PUBLICLY OWNED YOU TO. US FOR THIS MEASURE BECAUSE HAVE BEEN TURNING OFF POWER FOR DECADES UNDER MY SISTER WAY SINCE WE REPAIR WORK AND THEY HAVE. DONE A BENSON. UNTIL IT BASS IN YOU. FIRES ARE FAR DIFFERENT THAN REGULAR INTEREST REPAIR BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK THEY'VE DONE THE BEST THEY COULD DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY WERE DIRECTED BY THIS LEGISLATIVE. BODY IT ALSO STATES THAT REPAIR SHOULD NOT BE BURDENED WITH THE COST DURING POWER SHUT OFF AT NO TIME WAS I AWARE THAT A UTILITY EVER CHARGES YOU IF YOUR METER IS IT TURNED IF YOU'RE- AN ELECTRON. YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR THAT ELECTRIC BUT DIDN'T GO ACROSS TO OUR INTO YOUR HOME OR YOUR BUSINESS. YOU PAY FOR BACK CAN. SERVICE SECTOR. COST BUT THAT OUTLOOK TRON ITSELF YOU DON'T PAY FOR IT WAS A THE- NOW TO TALK ABOUT. ANY I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF RULE TWENTY I WORK FOR UTILITY AND I ADVOCATED STRONGLY FOR RULE TWENTY FOUR WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S A RULE TWENTY EIGHT ZERO TWENTY BEES. WROTE TWENTY SEATS. IF YOU ARE A- GROUNDING HUNDREDS OF MILES OF. TRANSMISSION WIRES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY OR ON STATE OR FEDERAL PROPERTY. THE PROPERTY IN WHICH IS BEING UNDERGROUND THEY PAY FOR NOT RATE PAYERS SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S NO FREE RIDE HERE'S SO EITHER THE LITTLE AN OWNER HAS TO BEAR THOSE COSTS OF UNDERGROUND AND UTILITY SHOULDN'T BE FORCED TO DO THAT. AND WE TALK ABOUT SERVICE RELIABILITY EVERY TIME YOU DO UNDERGROUND FACILITY THAT THE LADIES ROOM HERE'S WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT ADDS A LONGER DURATION OF THE OUTRAGE FROM UNDERGROUND VERSE WERE HAD FACILITIES SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M I'M I'M JUST. DâN I BRING MY HOPE TO SUPPORT IT I UNDERSTOOD AND INTENTIONS OF THE- AUTHOR AND I KNOW. GENUINE ANNE'S COULD BY. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GET TO YES WHAT WHAT IS BEFORE ME TODAY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR PAN AND THEN WE'LL ASK A SENATOR MARK. MCGWIRE TO RESPOND AND CLOSE. SENATE PAN. THANK YOU OF ACTUALLY I WOULD. APPRECIATE IF CENTER REQUIRED COULD DRESS PARTICULARLY THE CONCERNS OF THE COALITION CALIFORNIA TO THE EMPLOYEES- DAY EXPRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT- US THEIR WORK IS VERY DANGEROUS SO APPRECIATE. THAT AT. MY SISTER REQUIRED THIS IS THE DEEPER DESPAIR PROPER TIME FOR HIM TO RESPOND. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN- SENATOR REQUIRE WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND IN CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS THE CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER PANTS AND A RED. I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE OF US TODAY. WHO LIVES IN IS P. JEANNIE SERVICE SURGERY. WOULD RAISE THEIR HAND AND SAID. THEY DID A HELL OF A JOB. LAST YEAR. WE CAN'T DEFEND. UTILITY CAN'T DEFEND. WE'RE HERE TODAY WE'RE HERE TODAY AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GO INTO OUR NEXT POWER SHUT OFF SEASON BECAUSE IN PARTICULAR WITH P. JEANNIE THE LACK OF INVECTIVE INVESTMENT IN MISMANAGEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO LACK OF INVESTMENT GRADE HARDENING. SEXUAL LIES ATION VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND MODERNIZATION THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. IF YOU GO IN TALK WITH THEIR TOP EXECUTIVES. THEY'RE GONNA SAY ESPECIALLY IN THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND ON THE MODERNIZATION THEY'RE BEHIND THIS YEAR. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE'RE GONNA SAY TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIANS. HE GOT TEN YEARS OF THIS. TEN YEARS. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT EXPEDITES RIGHTFULLY SO IT EXPEDITES THE GRID HARDENING THE MODERNIZATION THE SECTION LIES ATION AS WELL AS THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. END LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FIFTEEN PERSONAL LINES. THIS STATE ISN'T TELLING THE UTILITIES WHICH ALIGNS THEY HAVE TO TAKE UTILITIES WORK WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IT'S IN THE BILL THE WORK WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON WHICH LINES THEY'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON EMPIRE TICE BASED OFF OF WHERE THOSE POWER SHUT OFF TO WAR. THERE IS NO LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT FORCE IS UTILITIES TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON ONE SPECIFIC LINE IT'S TEN PERCENT. AND ITS FOCUS OVER FIVE YEARS WE CUT THE TIMELINE IN FIVE YEARS IF I'M A CALIFORNIAN I THINK THAT'S- THREE YEARS TOO LONG. BECAUSE IT ENDED OR P. JEANNIE AND AUNTS ARE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT P. JEANNIE HAS SAID IS THEY'RE GONNA CUT THEIR FOOT PRINT THIS YEAR BY 30% 30% IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENED SO TALKING ABOUT NINE OH ONE THIS LEGISLATURE 100% GAVE UTILITIES RIGHTFULLY SO THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO TURN OFF THE POWER IN HIGH FIRE RISK PART OF THE SEASON. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THEIR PRIMARY TO. THE REASON WHY P. GENIE IS HAD TO USE IT AS A BLUNT INSTRUMENT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH THE MODERNIZATION THE GREAT HARDENING ERIN AND OR THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THEY HAVE NO OTHER TOOL TO BE ABLE TO USE. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF. HOW WE'RE HERE IF YOU SEE ALSO HAS TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY THE LACK OF SUPERVISION BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE'RE HERE. AND IT'S JUST BE CANDID CLIMATE CHANGE NOW AS EXASPERATED THIS PROBLEM. BACK IN 20001215% OF P. GENIES LINES WERE IN A HIGH FIRE RISK ZONE TO DAY TO DAY IT IS HALF. SO WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO TODAY IS TELL THOSE FOLKS WHO WE WORK FOR. AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS WORKING JOES THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL MINUTES AND YOU KNOW ME I WILL WORK WITH ANYONE AND EVERYONE WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS. AND I PROMISE YOU WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL BUT I GOTTA TELL YA I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE IN THIS LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT WILL STAND UP AND DEFEND. TEACHING THESE ACTIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IN WORK WITH THE UTILITY- BOTH THE ELECTRICAL WORKERS IN A CORPORATION TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE WE ALL WANT TO ACT WE CAN DO IT IN HALF THE TIME IN THE CASE. THAT THIS UTILITY IS. WE ASK. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE IS THERE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION FOR SENATOR STERN- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AND- PLEASE WE TO YOUR MICROPHONE IS ON BEFORE SPEAKING. SB THIRTY TWELVE BY SENATOR MCGUIRE DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS.

THEY OWN. AS QUOTED A LOT. DURATION PRESS IN SOME OF GO FOR FOUGHT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL. PARTICULARLY IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THE INDEPENDENT WHILE FIRE SAFETY ADVISORY BOARD ALSO RECOMMENDED IN A PRO THAT THE P. YOU SEE CONSIDER WHETHER THE UTILITIES ARE DEVELOPING A ROBUST TRAINING PROGRAMS. THAT ONE TRAIN WORKERS TO IDENTIFY HAZARDS THAT COULD IGNITE WILDFIRES. IN TO INCREASE THE POOL OF QUALIFIED ELECTRICAL WORKERS. CLEARLY WE NEED MORE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WORKING A WILDFIRE MITIGATION. WHERE COULD WE FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN JOIN THIS WORKFORCE WHO ALSO HAVE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE A GOOD PLACES WE CAN DO IS START WITH OUR LOCAL CONSERVATION STATE CONSERVATION CORES AS WELL AS OUR CDC ARE FAR CAMPS MEET MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE ON THE FRONTLINE OF MANY OF THE FIRES.

FOR WHILE FIRE MITIGATION THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THEM TO INDICATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE HIRING SKILLED INDIVIDUALS FROM CONSERVATION CORES AS WELL AS FROM FIRE CAMPS AND CREWS THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY GOOD FOR INCREASING SAFETY AND REDUCING TRAINING COSTS BUT IT ALSO INCREASES DIVERSITY IN WORK FORCE PEOPLE IN CONSERVATION CORES AND IN FIRE CAMPS ARE OFTEN BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS.
