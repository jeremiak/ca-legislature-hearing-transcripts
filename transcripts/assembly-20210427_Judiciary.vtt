LESS DISTRACTED BY GIRLS WHICH

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:16.300

POLITICAL SPECTRUM HAVE BECOME

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:59.374
INCREASINGLY ALARMED ABOUT THE

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.242
ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:01.776
AND MODERATING OUR PUBLIC

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:04.178
DISCOURSE FOR MANY PARTICULARLY

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:05.446
FOLLOWING THE HORRIFIC ASSAULT

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:06.514
ON OUR DEMOCRACY AT THE US

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:08.549
CAPITOL EARLIER THIS YEAR THESE

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:09.784
CONCERNS CENTER AROUND THE ROLE

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:11.052
THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:12.920
PLAY IN PROMOTING HATE SPEECH

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:15.456
DISINFORMATION CONSPIRACY

01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:17.058
THEORIES. AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.159
FOR OTHERS IT IS THE MYSTERY

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:19.460
BEHIND WHY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:21.796
IN CONTENT AND NOT OTHERS ARE

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:23.531
SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:24.732
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.300
THERE IS GROWING CONCERN ABOUT

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:28.369
SEVEREPOLITICAL POLARIZATION

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:29.337
AND THE ABILITY OF A HANDFUL OF

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:31.139
COMPANIES TO PROFOUNDLY SHAPE

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:33.174
THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE THAT IS

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:35.677
CENTRAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. AB

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:36.477
FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN ADDRESSES

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:37.578
THESE CONCERNS BY REQUIRING

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:39.147
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO SHARE

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.782
BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:42.417
CONTENT MODERATION PRACTICES

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.419
WITH CONSUMERS. IN PARTICULAR

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:45.586
THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.321
LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.323
PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE. THEIR

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:51.426
CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES.

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:52.960
HOW THOSE POLICIES ARE ENFORCED

01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:54.929
AND KEY METRICS AND DATA AROUND

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:55.463
THE ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.532
POLICIES. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:59.067
DOES NOT REQUIRE THESE

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:00.101
COMPANIES TO HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.937
POLICIES. NOR DOES IT REQUIRE

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:03.538
THEM TO UNDERTAKE ANY TYPE OF

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:05.373
ENFORCEMENT. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.674
THEM TO BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:07.775
WITH POLICYMAKERS AND THE

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:11.312
PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT. IF ANYTHING

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:11.846
THEY'RE DOING TO MODERATE

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:13.381
SPEECH ON THEIR PLATFORMS. THIS

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:14.882
NARROW PRESSURE SPECS THE FIRST

01:29:14.949 --> 01:29:16.284
AMENDMENT FEDERAL PREEMPTION

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.452

MUCH NEEDED PUBLIC

01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:21.823
ACCOUNTABILITY. IN SHORT THIS

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:23.091
BILL WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL MEDIA

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:24.559
PLATFORMS TO COME CLEAN ABOUT

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:25.193
HOW THEY ARE MODERATING

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:26.728
CONTENT. SO THAT WE CAN ALL

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:27.929
BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:29.497
AMPLIFYING CERTAIN VOICES AND

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:31.365
SILENCING OTHERS. THE PUBLIC

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:32.834
AND POLICY MAKERS DESERVE NO

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.969
LESS. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO KNOW

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.404
THAT WE APPRECIATE SEVERAL THE

INSTITUTE CENTER FOR PUBLIC

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:51.745
POLICY IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:55.115
BILL. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS

01:50:55.181 --> 01:50:57.751
THAT WE'RE IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:50:57.817 --> 01:50:59.786
BILL IS CONCERNED WITH WHERE

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:02.288
THIS WOULD TAKE THE UNRUH CIVIL

PRIVILEGES. IN BUSINESS

01:51:14.467 --> 01:51:16.002
ESTABLISHMENTS THIS BILL WOULD

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:17.637
DO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT

01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:20.040
THAN THAT THIS WOULD TAKE THE

01:51:20.106 --> 01:51:23.176
ANDREW ACT IN A DIRECTION WHERE

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:25.645
SIGNIFICANT FINES AND

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:27.614
ATTORNEY'S FEES COULD ACCRUE

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.850
NOT BECAUSE ANYONE IS DENIED A

01:51:30.917 --> 01:51:33.353
SERVICE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:35.789

ISAAC COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:42.595
OUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:44.397
THAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHAT

01:51:44.464 --> 01:51:46.733
THIS WOULD DO. IS TAKE THE

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.401
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT A DIRECTION

01:51:48.468 --> 01:51:51.237
WHERE- BY CUSTOMERS SUBJECTIVE

01:51:51.304 --> 01:51:53.640
EXPERIENCE OF FEELING
