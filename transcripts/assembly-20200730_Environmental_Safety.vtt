00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:18.536
LONG TERM CHRONIC THREATS TO

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:20.638
FARMWORKERS AND CONSUMERS ARE

GROWERS AND CHEMICAL COMPANIES

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.784
ARE RESISTED TESTING FOR HELP

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:35.953
TO FIX. SO THEY DON'T BàN THE

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.755
WORST OF THESE POISONS BECAUSE

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:39.824
SOME FORMER FOR MY GIVE BIRTH

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.759

PESTICIDES CARD K. SIR AND

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:04.181
BIRTH DEFECTS. SO WE ACCEPT

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:06.317
DECADES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:08.252
THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UPON THE

TO FARMWORKERS AND THEIR SONS

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:27.505
AND DAUGHTERS WHO HAVE KNOWN

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.440
TRAGEDY FROM PESTICIDES THERE

00:38:29.507 --> 00:38:33.144
IS NO ACCEPTABLE LEVEL EXPOSURE

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:33.978
TO ANY CHEMICAL THAT CAUSES

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:35.780

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:38.282
TOLERATION OF ANY TOXIC THE

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:40.251
CAUSES MISCARRIAGES STILLBIRTHS

00:38:40.317 --> 00:38:43.020
AND DEFORMED BABIES. RISK IS

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:45.056
ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LEVEL OF

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:47.324
EXPOSURE AND ANY LEVEL OF

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.593
EXPOSURE IS TOO MUCH. ISN'T

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.328
THAT THE STANDARD PROTECTION

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:52.763

WOULD BE BANNED FOR YOURSELF.

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:01.605
SO WHY DO WE ALLOW FARMWORKERS

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.207
TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:05.309

CONCEPTION OF THE YOU KNOW WHAT

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.395
WHAT THE MEANING OF SOLD IN THE

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:08.763
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS. THAT I

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:09.931

WE'RE ARE LEGISLATING

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.474
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. OUR HOPE

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:22.243
IS THAT OTHER LEGISLATURES

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:24.646

ANSWER LAST YEAR. OKAY BUT I

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:51.372

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:52.807
EASILY NOT EASY ENOUGH TO SAY

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.409

BILL- THE VETERANS COMMITTEE

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:45.193
DID NOT LOVE THE BILL AND SO. I

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:47.328
THOUGHT THAT WE COULD ALREADY.

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:48.363
MONEY THE WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:49.597
THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS ALREADY

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:50.865
OUT THERE AND THAT WE COULD

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.800
HELP VETERANS GROUPS APPLY FOR

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:10.551
IDEA AND IT WASN'T EVEN A

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:13.688
FISCAL ISSUE IT WAS JUST THAT.

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:15.590
THE VETERANS COMMITTEE THOUGHT

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:18.626
