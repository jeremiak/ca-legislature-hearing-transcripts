IN ALL OF AMERICA.

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:26.238 region:rollup2

00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:29.374 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER SECTOR.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:30.442 region:rollup2
THIS EXPLOSIVE GROWTH HAS BEEN

PROUD OF OUR PROGRESS.

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.919 region:rollup2
CLEAN ENERGY IS NOW A POLLUTER

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:42.721 region:rollup2
OF OUR ECONOMY AND IT IS HERE TO

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:44.122 region:rollup2
STAY.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:45.724 region:rollup2
BUT THE INDUSTRY IS NOT CREATING

00:28:44.122 --> 00:28:46.792 region:rollup2
JUST ANY OLD JOBS IT'S CREATING

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:48.560 region:rollup2
JOBS THAT SUPPORT THE MIDDLE

FOR FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS

00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:07.631 region:rollup2
OVER A DECADE AND RIGHT NOW THE

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:09.967 region:rollup2
WAY WE READ THE LANGUAGE IT

00:56:07.631 --> 00:56:11.335 region:rollup2
SIMPLY INSURES THAT CAR DOES NOT

00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:13.303 region:rollup2

00:56:11.335 --> 00:56:15.005 region:rollup2
OUR PS RULES --

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:17.207 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A FINE AMENDMENT BUT

00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:19.309 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE EQUAL PROTECTION --

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:20.711 region:rollup2
ARE EQUAL ON RULES AND FOR ALL

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:22.779 region:rollup2

THIS FRAMEWORK --

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:26.316 region:rollup2
FINALLY I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:26.950 region:rollup2

UNCERTAIN REGULATORY LEGAL FRAME

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:36.426 region:rollup2
LEGAL TYING UP BUT BEING FACED

00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:37.694 region:rollup2
BY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND BY

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:40.864 region:rollup2
THIS I MEAN THE NEW NORMAL THAT

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:43.166 region:rollup2

DRIVING UP THE COST OF CAPITAL

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:02.619 region:rollup2

CUSTOMER BILLS --

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:06.723 region:rollup2
BESIDES THAT UNCERTAINTY WE HAD

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:08.558 region:rollup2
A JOINT HEARING YESTERDAY WHERE

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:10.560 region:rollup2
WE HEARD ABOUT OTHER CHALLENGES

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:12.496 region:rollup2
IF WE PEEL BACK.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.865 region:rollup2

UNSPECIFIED RESOURCES HOW ARE WE

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:24.975 region:rollup2
GONNA TRACK ARE GREENHOUSE GASES

00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:29.046 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT TO GET IN ORDER.

00:57:24.975 --> 00:57:32.082 region:rollup2
AND PGD FEELS THAT WE SHOULD.

00:57:29.046 --> 00:57:33.617 region:rollup2
TAKE A MOMENT TO PAUSE --

00:57:32.082 --> 00:57:35.052 region:rollup2
RECONCILE THESE POLICY

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:37.220 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTIES BEFORE WE CAN MOVE

FORWARD.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:41.758 region:rollup2

00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:57.040 region:rollup2
I'M I JUST WANNA SUMMARIZE WHAT

YOU HEARD FROM THE FIRST TWO

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.210 region:rollup2

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:02.079 region:rollup2
WAS LAUDABLE GOAL.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:03.847 region:rollup2
NOT NOW.

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:06.316 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE NOT

00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:07.617 region:rollup2
NOW CLEARLY SINCE OUR RENEWABLE

CLIMATE POLICY PROGRAMS.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.022 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE IN

00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:12.990 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEEN A

00:58:12.022 --> 00:58:15.025 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ELECTRIC

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:16.159 region:rollup2
RATES.

00:58:15.025 --> 00:58:18.095 region:rollup2
UP FOR AGRICULTURE LIKE THE

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:19.663 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING COMMERCIAL SECTORS

00:58:18.095 --> 00:58:21.398 region:rollup2
WERE PAYING FAR MORE THAN OUR

00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:23.400 region:rollup2
COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES IN

00:58:21.398 --> 00:58:25.302 region:rollup2
OUR COMPETITION VOTE NATIONALLY.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.137 region:rollup2
AND INTERNATIONALLY MAKING IT

00:58:25.302 --> 00:58:29.373 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE ON

00:58:27.137 --> 00:58:30.774 region:rollup2
DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE --

00:58:29.373 --> 00:58:32.175 region:rollup2
THAT'S GETTING LAYERED ON IN

00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:33.844 region:rollup2
LAYERED ON AND LAYERED ON BY ALL

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:35.479 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS RENEWABLE

00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:36.747 region:rollup2
ENERGIES OF LAUDABLE GOAL

00:58:35.479 --> 00:58:38.248 region:rollup2
FARMERS ARE IMPLEMENTING

00:58:36.747 --> 00:58:39.916 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY ON THEIR FARMS

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:41.451 region:rollup2
ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.786 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING SIGNIFICANT

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:44.488 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN SOLAR.

00:58:42.786 --> 00:58:45.789 region:rollup2
AYE ENERGY INSTALLATIONS ON VOTE

00:58:44.488 --> 00:58:47.391 region:rollup2
DAIRIES AND FARMING OPERATIONS

00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:48.024 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE BUT WE DO NEED TO

00:58:47.391 --> 00:58:50.293 region:rollup2
TAKE A PAUSE AND TAKE A TIME OUT

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:51.862 region:rollup2
--

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:53.530 region:rollup2
THE WILDFIRE ISSUE IN AND OF

00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:55.465 region:rollup2
ITSELF IT'S GOING TO REPRESENT

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:57.467 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASES FOR

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:58.335 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS AS PJ NAY SEEKS TO I

00:58:57.467 --> 00:59:00.570 region:rollup2
KERATITIS.

00:58:58.335 --> 00:59:02.773 region:rollup2
THE LIABILITY FROM LAST YEAR'S

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:04.341 region:rollup2
FIRES THAT ALONE COULD ADD AS

00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:05.842 region:rollup2
MUCH TO THE PENNY A KILOWATT

00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:07.310 region:rollup2
HOUR TWO ELECTRIC RATES FOR

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:08.879 region:rollup2
LARGE.

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:11.114 region:rollup2
BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN THE STATE.

00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:12.716 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE DEEPLY CONCERNED

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:14.017 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT GOING FORWARD WE'RE

00:59:12.716 --> 00:59:14.317 region:rollup2
GONNA NEED TO HARDEN OUR SYSTEM

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:16.887 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT.

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:18.655 region:rollup2
FORCE FIRES THAT'S GONNA COME AT

00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:21.024 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS TO

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:22.793 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS IN THE STATE --

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:24.761 region:rollup2
IF WE LOOK TO THE GAS SECTOR OF

00:59:22.793 --> 00:59:26.563 region:rollup2
THOSE RATE INCREASES HAVE BEEN

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:29.166 region:rollup2
2240% AS WE DEALT WITH SAN BRUNO

00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:31.034 region:rollup2
AND PGD SERVICE TERRITORY AND

00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:32.369 region:rollup2
40% RATE INCREASE PROPOSED BY

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:33.603 region:rollup2
THE GAS COMPANY --

00:59:32.369 --> 00:59:35.972 region:rollup2
IT AS A RESULT OF RELEASE OF

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:37.474 region:rollup2
CANYON SO THERE'S A LOT MORE

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:39.309 region:rollup2
RATE INCREASES COMING FOR

00:59:37.474 --> 00:59:41.111 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING STORAGE MANDATES

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:42.579 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT PENDING LEGISLATION.

00:59:41.111 --> 00:59:43.980 region:rollup2
TO DOUBLE THAT STORAGE MANDATE

00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:45.015 region:rollup2
THAT STORAGE COMES AT

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.284 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT COST.

00:59:45.015 --> 00:59:50.353 region:rollup2
THE CPUC JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO --

00:59:47.284 --> 00:59:51.955 region:rollup2
BUT APPROVED SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:53.323 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ROUGHLY OF

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:55.392 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL BE VEHICLE CHARGING

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:57.594 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALL GETS

00:59:55.392 --> 00:59:58.862 region:rollup2
RATE BASED IT ADDS TO CONSUMER

00:59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.530 region:rollup2
COSTS IT'S PART OF OUR CLIMB

00:59:58.862 --> 01:00:01.932 region:rollup2
POLICIES IN THE STATE.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:04.000 region:rollup2
SO WHERE TO A CRITICAL POINT IF

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:04.768 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.336 region:rollup2
CONTINUES --

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:07.204 region:rollup2
TO MANDATE AFTER MANDATE

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:09.106 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO ADD THAT THESE

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:11.041 region:rollup2
COSTS WE'RE GOING TO START

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:12.809 region:rollup2
LOSING BUSINESSES I RECOGNIZE

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:13.577 region:rollup2
JOBS CAN BE CREATED BY SOLAR

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:15.245 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

01:00:13.577 --> 01:00:16.947 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL BUT YOU NEED TO START

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:18.615 region:rollup2
CALCULATING THE JOBS THAT ARE

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:20.250 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE LOST IN THIS STATE.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.751 region:rollup2
AS WE CONTINUE THIS INCREASING

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:24.020 region:rollup2
PUSH.

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:25.689 region:rollup2
TOWARDS ADDITIONAL MANDATES.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.357 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING GREAT IN THE STATE.

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:29.292 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS NOT NEEDED AT THIS

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:31.161 region:rollup2
TIME AND WE NEED TO TAKE A FEW

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:32.295 region:rollup2
MOMENTS TO STEP BACK.

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:34.531 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE UNCERTAINTY OF

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:35.732 region:rollup2
WILD FIRES WHO SERVING WHO AND I

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.700 region:rollup2
THINK THE OTHER BIG THEME IN

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:38.201 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY'S.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.769 region:rollup2
HEARING WAS --

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:41.938 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT A COMMUNITY CHOICE

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:43.273 region:rollup2
AGGREGATION GOT DIRECT ACCESS

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:44.241 region:rollup2
AND LOAD SERVING ENTITIES YOU

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:46.042 region:rollup2
GOT THE ABILITIES.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:47.144 region:rollup2
WHOSE PROCURING FOR WHOM AT THIS

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:48.778 region:rollup2
POINT WE NEED TO SOLVE THAT

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:50.046 region:rollup2
QUESTION WE NEED TO DEAL WITH

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:51.648 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION MOVING

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:52.382 region:rollup2
FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.017 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:55.552 region:rollup2
NOT JUST FOR THE UTILITIES BUT

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:56.953 region:rollup2
FRANKLY FOR RATEPAYERS WAR WE'RE

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:59.155 region:rollup2
GONNA BE SECURITIZED AND

01:00:56.953 --> 01:01:00.557 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:01.825 region:rollup2
IN ADDITIONAL RATES FOR

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:03.460 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS BECAUSE WILD FIRES

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.994 region:rollup2
AGAIN TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.895 region:rollup2
CONTINUED TO BEING HELD

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.696 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:08.231 region:rollup2
SO WE GOT A LOT OF BIG ISSUES ON

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:10.167 region:rollup2
THE ENERGY FRONT THAT NEED TO

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:11.635 region:rollup2
GET RESOLVED BEFORE WE TAKE THIS

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:13.470 region:rollup2
STEP.

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:14.004 region:rollup2

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.630 region:rollup2
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:22.732 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS BILL CANNOT SOLVE ALL

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:24.667 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:26.402 region:rollup2
UP ONE OF THE BIGGEST ARE

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:29.171 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WAS RAISED HERE

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:31.107 region:rollup2
WERE EQUAL RULES AND AND THE

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:32.008 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF COST IN THAT WAS

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:34.243 region:rollup2
MENTIONED BY ALL OF THE

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:35.745 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.313 region:rollup2
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:39.515 region:rollup2
THAT?

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:41.217 region:rollup2
IT DEFINITELY CONTAINS COST

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:42.385 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT UNLIKE SOME OF OUR

01:13:41.217 --> 01:13:44.186 region:rollup2
OTHER --

01:13:42.385 --> 01:13:46.055 region:rollup2
MANDATES AND LET ME READ THAT

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:47.757 region:rollup2

EIGHTEEN ARM SECTION

[inaudible]

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:53.362 region:rollup2
SEE.

01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:55.831 region:rollup2
ARM AND G..

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:58.634 region:rollup2
ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE I

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:59.769 region:rollup2
THINK OF THIS IS PAGE.

01:13:58.634 --> 01:14:01.871 region:rollup2
TEN THE COMMISSION SHALL

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:03.773 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A LIMITATION FOR EACH

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:05.474 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL CORPORATION ON THE

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:07.743 region:rollup2
PROCUREMENT EXPENDITURES. FOR

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:09.445 region:rollup2
ALL RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:11.814 region:rollup2
USED COMPLY WITH THE RENEWABLES

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:13.449 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO STANDARD.

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:15.584 region:rollup2
LIMITATION SHALL BE SET EVAN LOW

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:17.053 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND LISTEN CAREFULLY HERE

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:19.221 region:rollup2
THAT PREVENTION DISPROPORTIONATE

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:21.624 region:rollup2
RATE IMPACTS.

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:23.392 region:rollup2
FURTHER IT SAYS IN SECTION DE.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.926 region:rollup2
IF THE COST LIMITATION FOR

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:26.395 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL CORPORATION IS

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:27.530 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT.

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:29.065 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE PROJECTED COSTS OF

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:31.200 region:rollup2
MEETING THE RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:32.868 region:rollup2
STANDARD REQUIREMENTS.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.503 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATION MAY

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:35.504 region:rollup2
REFRAIN FROM ENTERING INTO NEW

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:37.239 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS ARE CONSTRUCTING

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:39.675 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:41.377 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE QUANTITY THAT CAN BE

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:42.845 region:rollup2
PROCURED WITHIN THE LIMITATION

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:44.480 region:rollup2
UNLESS ELIGIBLE RENEWABLE

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:46.015 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.950 region:rollup2
CAN BE PROCURED WITHOUT

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:49.952 region:rollup2
EXCEEDING A DEMAND AMISS

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:51.988 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN RATES.

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:53.756 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS AN EXTREMELY

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:55.658 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL.

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:57.893 region:rollup2
AND IT IS IT REALLY BREAKS

01:14:55.658 --> 01:15:00.062 region:rollup2
GROUND COMPARED TO OTHER

01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:02.231 region:rollup2
MANDATES THAT WE'VE HAD.

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:04.033 region:rollup2
FURTHER ON PAGE EIGHTEEN SO

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:06.268 region:rollup2
THERE'S A QUESTION IS EVERYONE

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:09.038 region:rollup2
HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:11.173 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE SEEM FROM THE CCA'S

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:12.375 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.776 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:17.780 region:rollup2
IS THAT THEY WOULD GO AND

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:17.780 region:rollup2
PURCHASE A RENEWAL BOWLER

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:22.485 region:rollup2
AND THEN --

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:24.420 region:rollup2
THE CUT PLACE THAT HAD --

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:26.188 region:rollup2
THE LOUD THAT HAD GIVEN THEM

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.590 region:rollup2
THAT ENERGY WITH THEN GO OUT AND

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:29.759 region:rollup2
PURCHASE COAL.

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:31.093 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO PREVENT THAT AND

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:31.694 region:rollup2
FORTUNATELY AGAIN I BELIEVE THIS

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:34.196 region:rollup2
WAS TAKEN IN NATURAL RESOURCES

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:37.400 region:rollup2
--

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:38.968 region:rollup2
IT SAYS ON PAGE --

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.770 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN OF THE BILL --

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:41.737 region:rollup2
LINE.

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:43.773 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:45.941 region:rollup2
THIS POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA SHALL

01:15:43.773 --> 01:15:47.376 region:rollup2
NOT INCREASED CARBON EMISSIONS

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:48.944 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE IN THE REST YOUR GRID.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:51.514 region:rollup2
ENCHILADA ALLOW RESOURCE

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:53.816 region:rollup2
SHUFFLING --

01:15:51.514 --> 01:15:55.251 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A KEY PART AGAIN OF MY

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:56.786 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING THIS SO THERE BEEN

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:57.553 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PUSHING THIS FOR A LONG

01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:58.988 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:01.490 region:rollup2
I'VE SAID WITHOUT THE PROPER

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:03.159 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:04.794 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF TO THE

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:06.495 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS I'VE TAKEN THE I

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:08.731 region:rollup2
THINK DO ANSWER.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:11.066 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FROM THE OPPOSITION.

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:12.301 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN I WOULD URGE US TO GO

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:14.170 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:16.105 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES AND OTHERS DO FACE

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:18.007 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WELL BEYOND THE SCOPE

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:20.309 region:rollup2
OF THIS BILL.

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:21.877 region:rollup2
FROM WILDFIRES AND OTHER ISSUES

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.645 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO SOLVE THOSE BUT

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:24.547 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:26.515 region:rollup2
THIS BILL.

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:29.351 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ANSWERS MY QUESTIONS

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:31.520 region:rollup2
SETS A GOAL BUT NOT A GOAL THAT

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:32.421 region:rollup2
WILL BE ACHIEVED IF THE COST IS

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.956 region:rollup2
TOO HIGH.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.758 region:rollup2
AND WILL NOT BE ACHIEVED THROUGH

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:37.526 region:rollup2
SHUFFLING THE DECK.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:39.528 region:rollup2
SO I AM FIRMLY IN SUPPORT OF

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:43.399 region:rollup2
THIS BILL AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:44.767 region:rollup2
TO VOTE I THANK YOU.

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:45.835 region:rollup2
I THINK DOCTOR QUIRK AS MAY HAVE

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:47.803 region:rollup2
DONE A BETTER JOB WITH YOUR BILL

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:48.838 region:rollup2
SENATORS AND SO SEVENTIES

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:52.541 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BECAUSE

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:55.511 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE SO MY MY REMARKS ARE

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:56.879 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE DO YOU FEEL LIKE.

01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:57.980 region:rollup2
ABOUT LINUS.

01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:58.547 region:rollup2
WITHOUT DOCTOR QUIRK PRESENTED.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:02.852 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS A SUFFICIENT

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:04.687 region:rollup2
OFFRAMP. FOR THIS BILL IF COSTS

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:05.287 region:rollup2
BECOME OUT OF CONTROL.

01:17:04.687 --> 01:17:09.425 region:rollup2
CONCERT MONSIEUR A FILAMENTOUS

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:10.392 region:rollup2
--

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:11.694 region:rollup2
AYE AYE WHAT OSES IT'S I DON'T

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:13.662 region:rollup2
THINK I COULD EVER ARTICULATED

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:15.264 region:rollup2
BETTER OF THEN THE DOCTOR QUIRK

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:16.365 region:rollup2
OF QUITE FRANKLY.

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:17.466 region:rollup2
NO WE HAD A VERY MEANINGFUL

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.168 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE WORKED VERY HARD

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:20.903 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO THE NECESSARY

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:24.106 region:rollup2
OFF RAMPS IF YOU WILL IN THE

01:17:20.903 --> 01:17:28.144 region:rollup2
EVENTS -- IF

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:30.579 region:rollup2
THE COST OF HAS AN IMPACT.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:32.047 region:rollup2
THE VOTE PRIVATE RESIDENCES OR

01:17:30.579 --> 01:17:33.215 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE BUSINESSES THAT

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:34.950 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:36.285 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GONNA GO 41100% CLEAN

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:38.687 region:rollup2
ENERGY IS TO GO.

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:40.589 region:rollup2
TO CARBON FREE 1100% TO JUST

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:41.991 region:rollup2
REACH A GOAL FOR THE GOAL SAKE

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:44.193 region:rollup2
BUT RATHER WE TAKEN TO MINE.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.995 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY AND WHAT

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:48.030 region:rollup2
THE NECESSARY OFF RAMPS ARE A TO

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:49.665 region:rollup2
EXIT THE IF YOU WILL IF THINGS

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:51.534 region:rollup2
THAT ARE UNFORESEEN CATASTROPHES

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:52.401 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC CATASTROPHES ECONOMIC

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:55.371 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION.

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:56.238 region:rollup2
OR I SHOULD SAY --

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:57.506 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST A DOWNTURN IN THE

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:59.608 region:rollup2
ECONOMY I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:01.143 region:rollup2
ARE NOT SUFFICIENT --

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:02.411 region:rollup2
I WAS GONNA GO OVER IT THAT THAT

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:03.212 region:rollup2
WAS YOUR RIG WHEN YOU ORIGINAL

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:04.046 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR WHICH I

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:05.681 region:rollup2
DID NOT.

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:07.449 region:rollup2
A ANSWER ORIGINALLY BUT I'VE

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:09.218 region:rollup2
SEEN MISTER A DOCTOR QUIRK

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:10.853 region:rollup2
ANSWERED HIM [inaudible]

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:12.588 region:rollup2
SO.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:15.291 region:rollup2
AS YOU SAY THAT ARE YOU SEEING

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:17.660 region:rollup2
THIS AS A MANDATE OR PLANNING

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:19.695 region:rollup2
GOAL POLITICAL.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:21.931 region:rollup2
WERE ALL CLEAR THAT'S THIS IS A

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.531 region:rollup2
PLANNING ALL THIS IS OVER GOING

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:23.065 region:rollup2
FOR BECAUSE OF THE BILL THREE

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.800 region:rollup2
FIFTIES A PLANNING GOAL.

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:25.834 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WOULD SAY --

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.470 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THE ISSUES DOCTOR

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:30.606 region:rollup2
QUICK BROUGHT UP WITH THAT --

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:32.074 region:rollup2
PERHAPS A DISPARITY IN THE AT

01:18:30.606 --> 01:18:33.475 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION IS I THINK PEOPLE ARE

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:35.044 region:rollup2
DOING.

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:36.212 region:rollup2
KINDA RESPONDING SOMETIMES ARE

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:36.812 region:rollup2
SCATTER SHOT APPROACH AND

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:39.215 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TRYING TO COVER THEIR

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:40.282 region:rollup2
BASES IF WE'RE GONNA GO DIRECT

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:42.318 region:rollup2
ACCESS OF THAT'S GOOD LOWER

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:44.453 region:rollup2
COSTS IN OF ME PROCUREMENT.

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:46.055 region:rollup2
THERE OKAY WITH THAT BUT SO I

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:47.056 region:rollup2
MEAN I I I JUST CONTINUE TO

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:48.657 region:rollup2
CAUTION ALL OF US AS WE GO

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:49.291 region:rollup2
FORWARD WE CAN'T BREATHE RIGHT

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.359 region:rollup2
NOW BECAUSE THE SMOKE IS SO BAD

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:52.628 region:rollup2
--

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:54.563 region:rollup2
IN THE VALLEY A AND WE KNOW THAT

01:18:52.628 --> 01:18:55.664 region:rollup2
THAT'S FROM CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.966 region:rollup2
WORKING TOWARDS THAT.

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:58.400 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO HAVE ONGOING

01:18:56.966 --> 01:19:00.002 region:rollup2
ECONOMIES THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.570 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF S. ARE GOING FORWARD

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:02.004 region:rollup2
AND LARGE INVESTMENTS THAT

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:02.938 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE MADE IN

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:04.740 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:06.075 region:rollup2
SO I ALSO HEAR YOU SAYING IN

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.309 region:rollup2
THIS THAT YOU ARE.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:09.111 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:10.846 region:rollup2
THE STRANDED ASSETS ISSUE THAT

WE WON'T GO INTO RIGHT NOW

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:39.441 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY BUT A BC IT'S A

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:44.013 region:rollup2
CONSUMER THE RAPE PARA WHO GET

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:45.514 region:rollup2
STRANDED ALSO BY MANAGEMENT --

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:47.750 region:rollup2
THAT'S WEIGHT MANAGEMENT

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:49.518 region:rollup2
DECISION THAT ARE --

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:51.754 region:rollup2
BICU USE OR I SHOULD SAY

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:53.122 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY VALUES --

01:19:51.754 --> 01:19:55.591 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN IMPACT --

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:58.394 region:rollup2

PS THEM THAT IS A PLANNING GO TO

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:07.436 region:rollup2
SPANGLED BUT THERE WOULD DO AND

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:08.604 region:rollup2
60% OF THE THE FORTY OR WE'RE

NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH THE WITH

01:20:08.604 --> 01:20:10.172 region:rollup2
THE CCA'S.

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:12.041 region:rollup2
YOU'RE JUST SAYING WE'RE GONNA

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:15.944 region:rollup2
LEAVE OUT OF THE LEGISLATORS TO

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:16.512 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING ABOUT LATER.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.713 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISS THE OLYMPICS

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:20.549 region:rollup2
EGGMAN [inaudible]

01:20:17.713 --> 01:20:22.451 region:rollup2
GALLAGHER.

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:23.252 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF WAS

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:25.354 region:rollup2
GALLAGHER SENATOR [inaudible]

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:26.889 region:rollup2
MY I HAVE A QUESTION FIRST IS

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:28.123 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IN THE BILL IT

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:29.258 region:rollup2
TALKS ABOUT.

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:31.226 region:rollup2
HAVING A BOUNCE IN BEING ABLE TO

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:32.995 region:rollup2
USE ZERO CARBON RESOURCES IS THE

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:33.996 region:rollup2
TERM THAT'S USED BUT THERE'S NO

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.297 region:rollup2
DEFINITION.

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:36.165 region:rollup2
IN THE BILL ABOUT WHAT

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:38.634 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTES ZERO CARBON

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:40.336 region:rollup2
RESOURCES --

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:42.738 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:44.340 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR HYDRO ELECTRIC.

01:20:42.738 --> 01:20:46.809 region:rollup2
AND GEOTHERMAL --

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:48.377 region:rollup2
ENERGY A IN THERE AND BECAUSE

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:49.712 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:50.679 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT REALLY DEFINED IN IT

01:20:49.712 --> 01:20:52.181 region:rollup2
MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THAT MIGHT BE

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.783 region:rollup2
LEFT UP TO THE IMPLEMENTING

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:55.718 region:rollup2
AGENCIES --

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:57.052 region:rollup2
AND FOR ME I THINK THAT WE

01:20:55.718 --> 01:20:58.520 region:rollup2
SHOULD TRY AND ESTABLISH THAT

01:20:57.052 --> 01:21:01.090 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AS TO

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.358 region:rollup2
WHAT CONSTITUTES --

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.992 region:rollup2
ZERO CARBON RESOURCES OTHERWISE

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.960 region:rollup2
IT CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND AS WE

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:06.328 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THERE'S A

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.163 region:rollup2
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT THE

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:10.733 region:rollup2
ZERO CARBON MARKET IS GONNA BE

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:11.900 region:rollup2
INTO THE FUTURE --

01:21:10.733 --> 01:21:12.668 region:rollup2
SO EVER COULD YOU ANSWER IT

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.937 region:rollup2
COULD YOU JUST I QUESTION

01:21:12.668 --> 01:21:16.138 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:17.806 region:rollup2
DEFINE THAT TERM POOL IT

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:19.608 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T INCLUDE THOSE TYPES OF

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:20.309 region:rollup2
OF ENERGY IT WILL IT WILL SAY

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:22.578 region:rollup2
THIS MISTER CALDERON THAT THAT'S

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:23.946 region:rollup2
A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:25.214 region:rollup2
WANTED TO PROVIDE.

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:26.682 region:rollup2
OF FLEXIBILITY WITH NEW

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:28.650 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ON THE

01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:31.086 region:rollup2
RISE AND AS LONG AS IT'S ZERO

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:31.854 region:rollup2
CARBON THERE'S SOME --

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:35.157 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL --

01:21:31.854 --> 01:21:36.859 region:rollup2
ENERGY RESOURCES.

01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:38.460 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE --

01:21:36.859 --> 01:21:40.095 region:rollup2
WOULD DESERVE IN A STEP CITY

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.297 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR FOR EXAMPLE COULD

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:45.000 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR BE YOU KNOW CONCEIVABLY

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:46.735 region:rollup2
PART OF THE OUR PS A IT COULD BE

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.569 region:rollup2
NOW WAYS IT ECONOMICALLY

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.170 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.139 region:rollup2
NOW ISN'T IT THAT'S A QUESTION

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:51.840 region:rollup2
--

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:53.041 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MAKES SENSE --

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.276 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO PUBLIC SAFETY

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:55.778 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:56.345 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS AND CENTS --

01:21:55.778 --> 01:21:57.679 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW GIVEN THE FACT

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:59.715 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:21:57.679 --> 01:22:02.017 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO PLANTS A A

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:03.352 region:rollup2
DIABLO CANYON AS WELL AS SENATE

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:04.787 region:rollup2
NO FREE AT SOMEBODY BEING

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:06.989 region:rollup2
MOTHBALLED.

01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:07.990 region:rollup2
DIABLO CANYON ARE OWNED.

01:22:06.989 --> 01:22:09.057 region:rollup2
BY ANOTHER STRAND OF ACID YOU

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:10.526 region:rollup2
KNOW BY OUT.

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:11.927 region:rollup2
OF P. GENIE THAT'S BEING A

01:22:10.526 --> 01:22:14.730 region:rollup2
MOTHBALL THE PLAN TO BE

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:16.498 region:rollup2
MOTHBALLED SO THAT IT'S OPEN

01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:17.766 region:rollup2
ENDED -- ó

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:19.301 region:rollup2
WANT TO KEEP IT OPEN AND IT WAS

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.536 region:rollup2
ANY POTENTIAL NEW TECHNOLOGY

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.170 region:rollup2
DEBTS CREATED.

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:25.808 region:rollup2
NAM I IN THE FUTURE IT COULD BE

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:27.976 region:rollup2
--

01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:29.912 region:rollup2
IS ON THAT ZERO CARBON VETO SO

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:31.814 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IT CLEARLY ALLOWS FOR

01:22:29.912 --> 01:22:33.649 region:rollup2
GEOTHERMAL AS WELL.

01:22:31.814 --> 01:22:35.250 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT HYDRO BECAUSE RIGHT

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:36.885 region:rollup2
NOW AS YOU KNOW?

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:38.320 region:rollup2
IS A LESSON THIRTY MEGAWATTS YOU

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:40.255 region:rollup2
THAT CAN COUNT THAT OVER THIRTY

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.858 region:rollup2
MEGAWATT HYDRO DOESN'T COUNT

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:44.993 region:rollup2
TOWARDS IPS COULD IT BE INCLUDED

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:46.228 region:rollup2
IN THE ZERO EMISSION.

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:47.129 region:rollup2
OUR RESOURCE WE LOVE AND WE LEFT

01:22:46.228 --> 01:22:48.096 region:rollup2
BEHIND WHAT WE DO IT'S VERY

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:49.965 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WE ESTABLISH THIS

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:53.936 region:rollup2
AND SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY TWO

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:55.838 region:rollup2
IN THE 40% WE ALLOW FOR HYDRO --

01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:57.506 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:22:55.838 --> 01:22:59.908 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:22:57.506 --> 01:23:01.743 region:rollup2
WAS NO --

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:03.078 region:rollup2
BRANIEWO HYDRO PLANTS THAT THAT

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.612 region:rollup2
WERE CREATED THAT THERE

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:04.713 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH HYDRO PLANTS ARE

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:07.249 region:rollup2
READY.

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:07.883 region:rollup2

CAN BE CREATED.

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:29.204 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU HAVE A AS AN ASSET

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.639 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE --

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:33.175 region:rollup2
THEY QUALIFY AS PART OF THAT OUR

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:48.717 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER SHOULD BE YES BUT I

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:50.285 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE.

01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:50.586 region:rollup2
OF CERTAIN FOR YOU OFFER

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:54.189 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:57.192 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:58.527 region:rollup2
BIG DEBTS THE ANSWER IS YES.

01:24:57.192 --> 01:25:01.196 region:rollup2
MATHIS WE WENT A LOT OF THE THE

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:01.863 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS YES AND IN PART OF

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:03.398 region:rollup2
WHAT AT THE CHAIRMAN JUST KIND

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:05.400 region:rollup2
OF PLAN AS IT'S NOT REALLY.

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:07.302 region:rollup2
SPELLED OUT AND AND AND PART OF

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:09.204 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A CONVERSATION IS GOING

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:10.339 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN LATER --

01:25:09.204 --> 01:25:11.540 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO HAPPEN HERE IN THE

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:13.809 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE I DON'T WANT TO BE

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.943 region:rollup2
DETERMINED BY THE AGENCIES YOU

01:25:13.809 --> 01:25:16.845 region:rollup2
KNOW AT THEIR WHIM WHAT THEY'D

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.580 region:rollup2
DETERMINE CONSTITUTES.

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:20.415 region:rollup2
A ZERO CARBON I THINK THAT WE

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.117 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO THAT I MEAN ONE OF MY

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:23.218 region:rollup2
CRITICISMS HAS BEEN THAT LOOK WE

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:24.987 region:rollup2
NEED TO LEGISLATE WE NEED TO

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:26.588 region:rollup2
FIND THESE THINGS.

01:25:24.987 --> 01:25:28.457 region:rollup2
HERE ARE NOT LEAVE THAT UP TO

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:29.358 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO BECAUSE

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.425 region:rollup2
WE'RE THE ONES WHO ARE

01:25:29.358 --> 01:25:31.860 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE YOU KNOW TO OUR

01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:33.795 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS ABOUT HOW THIS GETS

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:35.998 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED HOW GETS.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:37.766 region:rollup2
AND TAKEN OUT AND SO.

01:25:35.998 --> 01:25:40.902 region:rollup2
THIS KNOW MY CONCERNS YOU KNOW

01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:42.537 region:rollup2
WITH THIS POLICY IS. ONE I FEEL

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:43.905 region:rollup2
LIKE UP UNTIL THIS POINT.

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:45.073 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT OF RENEWABLE

01:25:43.905 --> 01:25:46.274 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO STANDARD FOR THE

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:48.510 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM TOO MUCH OF A

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:51.279 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO LARGELY IT HAS BEEN.

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:52.848 region:rollup2
SOLAR AND WIND --

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:54.516 region:rollup2
SOME GEOTHERMAL WHERE WE CAN DO

01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:55.984 region:rollup2
THAT BUT IT'S BEEN LIMITED.

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:57.486 region:rollup2
AND WE HAEN'T REALLY OPENED UP

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:59.788 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NOT A DIVERSE

01:25:57.486 --> 01:26:01.990 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO THE CAN HELP US.

01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:03.358 region:rollup2
YOU ACTUALLY ACTUALLY GET TO A

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.992 region:rollup2
HIGHER LEVEL OF RENEWAL BOARD.

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:06.028 region:rollup2
OF BEING USE HYDRO IS RENEWABLE

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:07.663 region:rollup2
--

01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:09.131 region:rollup2
RESOURCE IS A RENEWABLE POWER

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:10.365 region:rollup2
RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:26:09.131 --> 01:26:14.469 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:14.970 region:rollup2
UTILIZING. TO REACH THAT NON SO.

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:16.838 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:18.874 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO --

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:21.510 region:rollup2
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT RATE IMPACT

01:26:18.874 --> 01:26:22.544 region:rollup2
NOW WE CAN SAY IN THE BILL THAT.

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:23.912 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THIS

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:25.080 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE AN UNREASONABLE.

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:27.682 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON RATES WHAT DOES THAT

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:29.084 region:rollup2
MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DO YOU

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:31.453 region:rollup2
CONSIDER AND REASONABLE WHEN WE

01:26:29.084 --> 01:26:32.988 region:rollup2
FIRST STARTED OUR PS.

01:26:31.453 --> 01:26:35.724 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A WARNING FROM THE

01:26:32.988 --> 01:26:37.359 region:rollup2
CPUC THAT THIS COULD RAISE RATES

01:26:35.724 --> 01:26:39.327 region:rollup2
FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:41.630 region:rollup2
UPWARDS OF 30%.

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:43.532 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN TWENTY

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:45.867 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WE GOT THE STATS BACK.

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:48.103 region:rollup2
AND AND RESIDENTIAL ELECTRIC

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:50.105 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY RATES IN TWENTY

01:26:48.103 --> 01:26:50.639 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WHERE 34% HIGHER.

01:26:50.105 --> 01:26:53.208 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES WERE 48%

01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:54.409 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.912 region:rollup2
AN INDUSTRIAL RATES WERE 76%

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:58.613 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

01:26:56.912 --> 01:27:00.148 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA IT NOW WE'RE

01:26:58.613 --> 01:27:01.516 region:rollup2
GONNA GO TO YOU KNOW NOW WE'VE

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:03.085 region:rollup2
JUST SAID THE POLICY LAST YEAR

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:03.718 region:rollup2
TO GO.

01:27:03.085 --> 01:27:06.621 region:rollup2
TO FIFTY NOW WE'RE GONNA SET UP

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:07.522 region:rollup2
PLANNING GOAL THE SIXTY TO A

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:09.758 region:rollup2
HUNDRED WHERE THE RATES GOING TO

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:10.325 region:rollup2
GO THAT THE WE KNOW HISTORY IS

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:11.326 region:rollup2
THE BEST INDICATOR OF WHAT'S

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:13.161 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAPPEN RATES ARE GOING

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:14.496 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE.

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:16.198 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT IS

01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:17.532 region:rollup2
AN UNREASONABLE IMPACTOR RATES

01:27:16.198 --> 01:27:19.568 region:rollup2
IS IT GONNA BE THE LEGISLATURE

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:20.435 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE AN AGENCY.

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:22.204 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT'S

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:22.838 region:rollup2
DOMENICI'S.

01:27:22.204 --> 01:27:23.705 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD

01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:26.208 region:rollup2
DEFINE.

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:28.543 region:rollup2
AND THE PROBLEM IS.

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:29.377 region:rollup2
HERE'S A REALITY AND MANHATTAN

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:31.012 region:rollup2
MANHATTAN INSTITUTE DID A STUDY

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:32.247 region:rollup2
ON THIS.

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:33.615 region:rollup2
AND THEY SAID THAT NEARLY ONE

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:35.016 region:rollup2
MILLION CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:37.152 region:rollup2
LIVE IN ENERGY POVERTY WHICH

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:38.253 region:rollup2
MEANS THEY PAY MORE THAN 10%.

01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:40.021 region:rollup2
OTHER DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:41.223 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY.

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.723 region:rollup2
THAT'S A VERY TOUGH THING TO

01:27:41.223 --> 01:27:42.991 region:rollup2
SWALLOW ESPECIALLY IN MY

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:44.459 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:46.862 region:rollup2
I THINK IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:47.729 region:rollup2
SENATOR I AND IN MANY PARTS OF

01:27:46.862 --> 01:27:48.196 region:rollup2
IN THE CALIFORNIA THEY POINT OUT

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:50.766 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:51.933 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SAN FRANCISCO IT'S ONLY

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:53.668 region:rollup2
THREE POINT 6% LIVE ENERGY

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:55.303 region:rollup2
POLICY.

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:56.571 region:rollup2
BUT IN EMLYN CENTRAL VALLEY

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:58.540 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S 15%.

01:27:56.571 --> 01:28:00.442 region:rollup2
THAT LIVE IN THAT.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.042 region:rollup2
AT THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE AND IF

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:01.810 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:03.345 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT.

01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:05.413 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT DIRECT

01:28:03.345 --> 01:28:06.848 region:rollup2
AXIS THAT IS AND THAT.

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:08.416 region:rollup2
THAT'S LIKE SWATTING AND THAT

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:09.784 region:rollup2
THE BIG COST DRIVER.

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:12.454 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND ENERGY HAS

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:14.356 region:rollup2
BEEN OUR PS PERIOD IS RAISE

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:15.123 region:rollup2
RATES TO CERTAIN WOULDN'T LOSE

01:28:14.356 --> 01:28:15.724 region:rollup2
CHAIR.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.092 region:rollup2
UP LET ME JUST FINISH NOW AND

01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:18.760 region:rollup2
YOU AYE YOU CAN RESPOND TO EACH

01:28:17.092 --> 01:28:19.294 region:rollup2
OF THESE THINGS BUT THE FACT OF

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.962 region:rollup2
THE MATTER IS IT HAS RAISE

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:22.664 region:rollup2
RATES.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:25.467 region:rollup2
AND IS MADE IT VERY HARD WE HAVE

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:26.835 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:28.637 region:rollup2
ENERGY IS PART OF THAT BECAUSE

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:29.638 region:rollup2
IT'S PART OF OUR DISPOSE IF YOU

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:31.173 region:rollup2
CAN'T GET AROUND YOUR P. JEANNIE

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:33.175 region:rollup2
BILL BELIEVE ME I'M A FATHER.

01:28:31.173 --> 01:28:34.643 region:rollup2
AND MY WIFE THE MOTHER WE PAY

01:28:33.175 --> 01:28:36.077 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:38.313 region:rollup2
EVERY DOLLARYEAH AYE AYES AYE

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:39.948 region:rollup2
CUT YOU OFF BUT I THINK AND IN

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:41.183 region:rollup2
ORDER -- FOR

01:28:39.948 --> 01:28:43.084 region:rollup2
THE SENATOR TO BE ABLE TO

01:28:41.183 --> 01:28:44.219 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION THEN

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:45.921 region:rollup2
MAYBE YOU CAN JUST.

01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:46.755 region:rollup2
I WILL I WILL BE I WILL BE VERY

01:28:45.921 --> 01:28:47.789 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR AT ALL WITH THE COURT

01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:49.057 region:rollup2
HELD A NEWS OF THE FINISH UP THE

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:50.091 region:rollup2
LAST COUPLE POINTS AND THEN I

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:51.493 region:rollup2
WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:53.662 region:rollup2
SENATOR RESPOND TO THIS BECAUSE

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:54.162 region:rollup2
AT THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:55.597 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:57.098 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPORTANT --

01:28:55.597 --> 01:28:58.900 region:rollup2
ONE WE CAN'T SUSTAIN BASELOAD

01:28:57.098 --> 01:29:00.101 region:rollup2
POWER THAT'S THE ISSUE YOU CAN'T

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.969 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN BASE LOW POWER ON

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:02.804 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE.

01:29:00.969 --> 01:29:04.606 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ALONE ESPECIALLY IF

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:05.106 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COUNT HYDRO

01:29:04.606 --> 01:29:06.708 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S STILL AN OPEN

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:08.143 region:rollup2
QUESTION --

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:10.512 region:rollup2
ENERGY DEMAND IS GOING TO

01:29:08.143 --> 01:29:11.546 region:rollup2
INCREASE NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE

01:29:10.512 --> 01:29:13.148 region:rollup2
PRECISELY BECAUSE OF

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:14.449 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:16.251 region:rollup2
ALL THESE CHARGING STATIONS THAT

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:18.086 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

01:29:16.251 --> 01:29:18.954 region:rollup2
GUESS WHAT NEED ELECTRICITY.

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:19.688 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THESE CHARGING

01:29:18.954 --> 01:29:21.323 region:rollup2
STATIONS INTO CHARGE ELECTRIC

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:23.825 region:rollup2
VEHICLES.

01:29:21.323 --> 01:29:26.161 region:rollup2
SO IT'S GONNA GO UP AND IF IF IF

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:27.996 region:rollup2
POWERS INTERMITTENT.

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:29.264 region:rollup2
AND FROM WHAT WILL MOSTLY A

01:29:27.996 --> 01:29:30.365 region:rollup2
SOLARIUM WHEN.

01:29:29.264 --> 01:29:31.333 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT BASE OF

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:32.901 region:rollup2
POWER WE'RE GOING TO NEED

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:33.768 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS WE'RE GOING TO NEED

01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:34.703 region:rollup2
HYDRO.

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:35.003 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS TO HELP

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:36.671 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:39.140 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN IT.

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:41.543 region:rollup2
JOBS VERY QUICKLY --

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.811 region:rollup2
YES THIS HAS CREATED SOME.

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:44.613 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD PAYING CONSTRUCTION

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:46.114 region:rollup2
JOBS ON THE FRONT END.

01:29:44.613 --> 01:29:47.649 region:rollup2
BUT THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:49.451 region:rollup2
JOBS LIKE THOSE IN THE NATURAL

01:29:47.649 --> 01:29:50.785 region:rollup2
GAS PLANT THIS IN MY DISTRICT

01:29:49.451 --> 01:29:52.621 region:rollup2
CALPINE THAT WAS SHATTERED A

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:53.688 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS AGO AND NOW IS BACK

01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:55.724 region:rollup2
OPEN BECAUSE WE KNOW WE NEED IT.

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:56.625 region:rollup2
WE SHATTERED IT.

THE PAST AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.830 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING WE NEED

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:43.565 region:rollup2
BETTER FORESTRY MANAGEMENT WE

NEED TO CLEAN CLEAN HAVE BETTER

01:31:43.565 --> 01:31:46.534 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT IN OUR FORCE.

THAT'S IN THE NORTH STATE THAT'S

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.076 region:rollup2
DOWN IN SAN DIEGO.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:56.878 region:rollup2

01:31:57.946 --> 01:32:00.749 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:02.751 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXACERBATED

01:32:00.749 --> 01:32:05.053 region:rollup2
THAT BUT WE'VE ALWAYS HAD IT.

01:32:02.751 --> 01:32:06.888 region:rollup2
AND THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE DONE.

01:32:05.053 --> 01:32:08.523 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY ZERO ON FORESTRY

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:09.124 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S THE

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:10.258 region:rollup2
BIGGEST CARBON EMITTER IN THE

01:32:09.124 --> 01:32:11.826 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:13.328 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST CARBON EMITTER IN

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:14.796 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS FOR SOME WE DONE

01:32:13.328 --> 01:32:16.197 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT IT.

01:32:14.796 --> 01:32:18.233 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S GREAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:18.800 region:rollup2
OR ELECTRICAL GRID.

01:32:18.233 --> 01:32:20.168 region:rollup2
ZERO BUT YOU STILL HAVE ALL

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.703 region:rollup2
THESE FOUR SPIRES OF THE DON'T

01:32:20.168 --> 01:32:22.570 region:rollup2
DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:23.872 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE WE'RE GOING TO

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:25.740 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HAVE CARBON EMISSION

01:32:23.872 --> 01:32:27.042 region:rollup2
AND IF WE BUY POWER FROM OTHER

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.743 region:rollup2
WESTERN STATES WERE DOING COAL

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:29.677 region:rollup2
FIRED PLANTS.

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:32.347 region:rollup2
WHO ARE DOING HYDRO THAT WE

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:33.748 region:rollup2
WON'T DO --

01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:34.783 region:rollup2
YEAH I MEAN DOES THAT MAKE ANY

01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:37.252 region:rollup2
KIND OF SENSE WHILE OUR RATE

01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:39.921 region:rollup2
PAYERS PAY EXPONENTIALLY MORE.

01:32:37.252 --> 01:32:41.222 region:rollup2
AND LIVE IN ENERGY POVERTY.

01:32:39.921 --> 01:32:43.458 region:rollup2
THAT TO ME IS JUST NOT A LONG

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:45.660 region:rollup2
TERM --

01:32:43.458 --> 01:32:46.594 region:rollup2
VIABLE PLAN FOR ENERGY AYE I

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.063 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A LOT WE TALK

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:49.497 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS LOT THIS COMMITTEE.

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:50.665 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED TO GET IT RIGHT.

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:51.833 region:rollup2
AND THAT MEANS TAKING A PAUSE

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:53.935 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE NOT JUST FAST

01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:56.604 region:rollup2
FORWARDING ON THIS ONE WE JUST

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:58.139 region:rollup2
DID A MANDATE LAST YEAR --

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.706 region:rollup2

AND SO THERE ARE. TWO THINGS

01:33:04.479 --> 01:33:07.916 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL --

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:09.884 region:rollup2

NUMBER -- SO

01:33:14.122 --> 01:33:20.562 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL.

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:24.766 region:rollup2
YEAH THERE'S BEEN A MOTION TO

01:33:20.562 --> 01:33:26.301 region:rollup2

--

01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:39.547 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:33:37.912 --> 01:33:40.982 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS IN THE TECHNICAL.

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:42.650 region:rollup2
PART OF THE BILL AND THIS IS A

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:44.052 region:rollup2
GOAL AND GOING FORWARD THERE

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:45.687 region:rollup2
WILL BE OTHER LEGISLATION I'M

01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:46.754 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WILL IMPACT THIS.

01:33:45.687 --> 01:33:47.755 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE AREDEFICIENCIES

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:51.726 region:rollup2
OTHER LEGISLATION COULD ALWAYS

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:54.162 region:rollup2
BE INTRODUCED. TO TAKE ON ANY OF

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:55.096 region:rollup2
THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:33:54.162 --> 01:33:56.297 region:rollup2
NOT CERTAIN TYPES OF VERNE OF

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:57.332 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN CAN BE RENEWABLE OTHER

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:59.667 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION COULD ALWAYS BE

01:33:57.332 --> 01:34:00.235 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED. TO DEAL WITH THOSE

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:01.302 region:rollup2
SUBJECTS IN ANYTHING AT THIS

01:34:00.235 --> 01:34:02.770 region:rollup2
BILL --

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:05.707 region:rollup2
HASN'T TACKLE BUT JUST AT THE

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:07.442 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVEL ALL OF THE ECONOMIC

01:34:05.707 --> 01:34:09.310 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF THIS BILL PALE IN

01:34:07.442 --> 01:34:11.212 region:rollup2
COMPARISON WITH THE ECONOMIC

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:13.448 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:15.250 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:34:13.448 --> 01:34:16.618 region:rollup2
PRICE OF RENEWABLE SOMETIMES

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:18.286 region:rollup2
BEING HIGHER ON THAT WILL AS WE

01:34:16.618 --> 01:34:19.988 region:rollup2
SAW WITH SOLAR AS THE NEW

01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:21.789 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES ARE INTRODUCED THAT

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:23.658 region:rollup2
BRINGS THE PRICE DOWN AND HIS

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:25.159 region:rollup2
NEW TRANSMISSION IS INTRODUCED

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:26.661 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE IN SOME

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:27.729 region:rollup2
PLACES.

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:28.329 region:rollup2
THAT BRINGS THE PRICE DOWN

01:34:27.729 --> 01:34:29.764 region:rollup2
BRINGS THE TREATMENT DEALS OF

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:32.467 region:rollup2
THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM BUT YOU

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:34.068 region:rollup2
NEVER HAVE THE DRIVER TO BRING

01:34:32.467 --> 01:34:36.171 region:rollup2
THOSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO MARKET

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:36.804 region:rollup2
OR TO DEAL WITH TRANSMISSION

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:38.106 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN AREAS THAT ARE HAVING

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:39.707 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION ISSUES.

01:34:38.106 --> 01:34:42.510 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING A STRONG MARKET

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:44.078 region:rollup2
SIGNAL SUCH AS IS BEING OB

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.480 region:rollup2
CREATED BY THIS BILL.

01:34:44.078 --> 01:34:47.916 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY HAVING THESE

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.185 region:rollup2
GOALS IS SO IMPORTANT TO SHOW

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:51.519 region:rollup2
INVESTORS THAT THERE IS --

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:52.954 region:rollup2
ARE NEAT THAT THERE IS A NEED

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:54.689 region:rollup2
FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES OF THEY DO

01:34:52.954 --> 01:34:55.423 region:rollup2
INVEST THEIR DOLLARS --

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:56.824 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT

01:34:55.423 --> 01:35:00.028 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST

01:34:56.824 --> 01:35:01.162 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IS THERE --

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:03.264 region:rollup2
NEEDING TO PURCHASE THAT

01:35:01.162 --> 01:35:05.300 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND THAT'S WHY EVEN

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:06.868 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE MAY BE A SMALL PART OF

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:08.636 region:rollup2
THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTER IS

01:35:06.868 --> 01:35:09.771 region:rollup2
FOR THE ENTIRE PLANET WHAT WE DO

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:12.006 region:rollup2
HERE IS SO IMPORTANT.

01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:14.042 region:rollup2
AYE LAST YEAR I WAS VERY HONORED

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:14.609 region:rollup2
TO HAVE BEEN SENT --

01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:17.612 region:rollup2
TO GERMANY TO BE PART OF THE

01:35:14.609 --> 01:35:19.180 region:rollup2
COPE CONFERENCE WHICH IS THE

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:26.060 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT IT FROM DIFFERENT

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:27.762 region:rollup2

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.996 region:rollup2
SOLAR IS IMPORTANT TO US IN THE

01:39:27.762 --> 01:39:31.032 region:rollup2
STATE WIND.

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:33.234 region:rollup2
IS MUTUALLY IMPORTANT --

01:39:31.032 --> 01:39:35.236 region:rollup2

THINK THIS WORKS UNLESS WE HAVE

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:59.327 region:rollup2
A ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

01:39:57.458 --> 01:40:00.161 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION I DON'T THINK IT

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:01.863 region:rollup2
WORKS.

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:03.598 region:rollup2

ALL OF US --

01:41:17.572 --> 01:41:20.808 region:rollup2
THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISES SOME

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:22.343 region:rollup2
VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:24.378 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS.

01:41:22.343 --> 01:41:26.113 region:rollup2

<u><c.green>OMMITTEE FOR CONSUMER PERIOD OF</c></u>

01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:28.683 region:rollup2
TIME I HAVE SEEN THE

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:29.317 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

01:41:28.683 --> 01:41:32.420 region:rollup2
UP WE HAVE VERY RAPID A RAMP UP

01:41:29.317 --> 01:41:33.955 region:rollup2
--

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:36.157 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:41:33.955 --> 01:41:37.725 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS A OF DEMAND TWINS WIND

01:41:36.157 --> 01:41:39.994 region:rollup2
AND SOLAR IS GOING AWAY --

01:41:37.725 --> 01:41:42.096 region:rollup2
THE RESULT OF THAT HAS BEEN THAT

01:41:39.994 --> 01:41:44.231 region:rollup2
THERE THAT THE GRID HAS BEEN --

01:41:42.096 --> 01:41:46.367 region:rollup2
MADE RELIABLE AND BALANCED BY

01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:48.903 region:rollup2
LARGE HYDRO.

01:41:46.367 --> 01:41:50.438 region:rollup2
BY NATURAL GAS AND BY IMPORTS

01:41:48.903 --> 01:41:52.440 region:rollup2
ALL OF WHICH ARE IN ONE WAY OR

01:41:50.438 --> 01:41:54.375 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.010 region:rollup2
SUSPECT BY AN UP AND MANY PEOPLE

01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:58.079 region:rollup2
IN THIS --

01:41:56.010 --> 01:42:00.381 region:rollup2
NOW IN IN THIS LEGISLATURE WE

01:41:58.079 --> 01:42:03.050 region:rollup2
ARE DOING THE SAME THING OVER

01:42:00.381 --> 01:42:05.252 region:rollup2
AGAIN THAT WE DON BEFORE.

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:08.122 region:rollup2
THIS WILL INCREASE RATES.

01:42:05.252 --> 01:42:10.825 region:rollup2
THIS WILL DECREASE RELIABILITY.

01:42:08.122 --> 01:42:13.260 region:rollup2
THAT COST ANALYSIS HERE I THINK

01:42:10.825 --> 01:42:16.664 region:rollup2
IS M. DE OF ART IS AMBIGUOUS IT

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.565 region:rollup2
IS THE SAME KIND OF AMBIGUITY

01:42:16.664 --> 01:42:19.066 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK --

01:42:17.565 --> 01:42:20.835 region:rollup2
RAISES SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS

01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:22.403 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEIR WHAT KIND OF RATE

01:42:20.835 --> 01:42:24.171 region:rollup2
INCREASES ARE WE GOING TO SEE.

01:42:22.403 --> 01:42:25.840 region:rollup2
I REALLY DO THINK THAT --

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:27.942 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY WITH

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:29.844 region:rollup2
RESPECT OFF RAMPS ARE.

01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:31.779 region:rollup2
A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ME.

01:42:29.844 --> 01:42:33.481 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANNA ECHO THE

01:42:31.779 --> 01:42:34.448 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS CONCERNS OF WHY I'M

GOING TO VOTE NO [inaudible]

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:41.222 region:rollup2
NOT NOW THIS IS A LEAP OF FAITH

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:42.857 region:rollup2
AND A GAMBLE GIVEN THE SET OF

01:42:41.222 --> 01:42:44.258 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES OUR RATEPAYERS.

01:42:42.857 --> 01:42:45.426 region:rollup2
AND OUR EMPLOYERS ARE IN AT

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:47.595 region:rollup2
PRESENTLY AS A RESULT THE

01:42:45.426 --> 01:42:50.331 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS POLICY SO I'M GONNA

01:42:47.595 --> 01:42:52.900 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY BUT NO [inaudible]

01:42:50.331 --> 01:42:54.769 region:rollup2
PATRICK.

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:57.004 region:rollup2
I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE MAKING

01:42:54.769 --> 01:42:58.839 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS NOW --

01:42:57.004 --> 01:42:59.874 region:rollup2
GA AND I WILL I WILL BE BRIEF

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:00.541 region:rollup2
SINCE AYE I WOULD ASSOCIATE SOME

01:42:59.874 --> 01:43:02.743 region:rollup2
AYE COMES WITH MR GALLAGHER AND

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:03.377 region:rollup2
MR GARCIA BUT JUST ON THIS ISSUE

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:06.280 region:rollup2
OF AND I MEAN TO TO MISTREATMENT

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:07.381 region:rollup2
--

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.549 region:rollup2
TO YOU TO GO BACK.

01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:10.851 region:rollup2
TO USING MY FORMER CAREER AS A

01:43:08.549 --> 01:43:12.319 region:rollup2
AS A THERAPIST OFTENTIMES WHEN

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:13.421 region:rollup2
WE LOOK WITH WHICH THEY WERE

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:14.689 region:rollup2
WITH THE NBA THE WORLD WHEN WE

01:43:13.421 --> 01:43:15.623 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAMILY

01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:16.824 region:rollup2
DOWN THE STREET THEY LOOK LIKE

01:43:15.623 --> 01:43:18.659 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT IT ALL TOGETHER. TO

01:43:16.824 --> 01:43:20.094 region:rollup2
GET INSIDE THE HOUSE RIGHT AND

01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:21.662 region:rollup2
THEN YOU SEE THAT THIS THERE'S

01:43:20.094 --> 01:43:23.097 region:rollup2
MORE ISSUES GOING ON THEN IT

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:24.165 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE.

01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:25.566 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:43:24.165 --> 01:43:26.867 region:rollup2
GRAPPLING WITH HERE RIGHT WE

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:28.335 region:rollup2
HOLD OURSELVES OUT AS A BEACON

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:29.804 region:rollup2
TO THE WORLD AND YET WHEN YOU

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:31.305 region:rollup2
GET DOWN INTO A WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:43:29.804 --> 01:43:31.972 region:rollup2
DIVISION IN THAT WE HAVE A LOT

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:32.573 region:rollup2
OF THINGS THAT WE STILL NEED TO

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.674 region:rollup2
WORK OUT.

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:34.875 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT SIGNALS TO

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:36.377 region:rollup2
THE MARKET WE HAVE SIGNAL TO THE

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:38.079 region:rollup2
MARKET BEFORE AND HAVE SEEN

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:39.647 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AND NOW WE'RE SEEING

01:43:38.079 --> 01:43:40.614 region:rollup2
UP DIFFERENT SIGNALS RATE AND

01:43:39.647 --> 01:43:41.248 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE SHIFTING SIGNALS.

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:42.349 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:44.452 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO BE REALLY

01:43:42.349 --> 01:43:45.119 region:rollup2
CAREFUL BALANCING AND ALSO WHEN

01:43:44.452 --> 01:43:46.220 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THE RENEWABLE

01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:48.622 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO.

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:50.591 region:rollup2
THAT AGAIN WE ARE VERY INCLUSIVE

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:51.525 region:rollup2
AND OF THAT I'M ALSO VERY

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:53.794 region:rollup2
CONCERNED OF THE FLUORESCENT

01:43:51.525 --> 01:43:55.029 region:rollup2
BIOMASS AND AND HOW DO WE HOW DO

01:43:53.794 --> 01:43:56.130 region:rollup2
WE INCLUDE ALL OF THOSE THINGS

01:43:55.029 --> 01:43:56.831 region:rollup2
WHILE THEY MAY NOT BE THE MOST

01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:58.165 region:rollup2
CLAIM.

01:43:56.831 --> 01:44:00.534 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE SO MANY ADDITIONAL

01:43:58.165 --> 01:44:02.536 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT OUR ECONOMY AND

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:03.871 region:rollup2
OUR ENVIRONMENT NEED THAT WE

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:06.040 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE LIKE A COST BENEFIT

01:44:03.871 --> 01:44:08.275 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.676 region:rollup2
OF OF OF RENEWABLES AND MAKE

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:11.445 region:rollup2
SURE.

01:44:08.676 --> 01:44:14.482 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE COMPREHENSIVE IN HOW

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:15.316 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THAT SO THAT MEANS.

01:44:14.482 --> 01:44:18.018 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO TO BE SUPPORTING THIS

01:44:15.316 --> 01:44:19.954 region:rollup2
BILL TODAY AB BUT CAUTION AS WE

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:20.521 region:rollup2
GO FORWARD AND MULTIPLE.

01:44:19.954 --> 01:44:22.923 region:rollup2

WITH THESE GREAT IDEAS.

01:44:27.328 --> 01:44:30.064 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN AS WE TALK ABOUT

01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:31.265 region:rollup2
SIGNALS TO THE MARKET.

01:44:30.064 --> 01:44:33.134 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:34.502 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS

01:44:33.134 --> 01:44:36.837 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IS NOT.

01:44:34.502 --> 01:44:38.606 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO WE LOOK AT ADDITIONAL

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:38.906 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:43.277 region:rollup2

WITH GALLAGHER AND AND MR GARCIA

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:10.958 region:rollup2
I I THINK IF WE CARE ABOUT

01:52:10.023 --> 01:52:12.326 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES WE SHOULD TREAT THEM

01:52:10.958 --> 01:52:13.560 region:rollup2
ALL SPECIAL.

01:52:12.326 --> 01:52:15.429 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THOUGH THERE

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.730 region:rollup2
ARE ISSUES WITH BIOMASS AND

01:52:15.429 --> 01:52:17.998 region:rollup2
GEOTHERMAL THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:52:16.730 --> 01:52:19.600 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED AND THEY THINK THAT

01:52:17.998 --> 01:52:21.034 region:rollup2
WHEN WE SAY WE GIVE A SIGNAL TO

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:22.002 region:rollup2
THE MARKET YES LEGISLATION GIVES

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:24.805 region:rollup2
A SIGNAL TO THE MARKET.

01:52:22.002 --> 01:52:26.840 region:rollup2
BUT YES LEGISLATION GIVES A

01:52:24.805 --> 01:52:28.675 region:rollup2
SIGNAL TO THE MARKET BUT WE ALSO

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.676 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZING THAT GIVES A SIGNAL

01:52:28.675 --> 01:52:31.278 region:rollup2
TO THE MARKET.

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:33.146 region:rollup2
TOO SOON WE SUBSIDIZE SOLAR WE

01:52:31.278 --> 01:52:34.381 region:rollup2
DON'T TAKE CARE OF BIOMASS AND

01:52:33.146 --> 01:52:36.583 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES I DON'T

01:52:34.381 --> 01:52:37.751 region:rollup2
WORK A LOT IN ENVIRONMENT I WORK

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:39.419 region:rollup2

01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:41.088 region:rollup2
DEATHLY WORKING POVERTY.

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:42.322 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE

01:52:41.088 --> 01:52:43.790 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES HAVE SUFFERED

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:45.559 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY FROM PLACES LIKE

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:47.761 region:rollup2
CALPINE CLOSING.

01:52:45.559 --> 01:52:49.162 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THIS

01:52:47.761 --> 01:52:51.331 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE NOT TAKEN

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:52.899 region:rollup2
CARE OF AND THERE IS ENERGY

01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:54.568 region:rollup2
POVERTY AND I COME FROM A

01:52:52.899 --> 01:52:56.436 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE THEY CAN

01:52:54.568 --> 01:52:57.504 region:rollup2
HAVE SIX HOLES IN THE SIX HOLES

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:58.839 region:rollup2
IN THEIR SELLING FOR LIGHTS AND

01:52:57.504 --> 01:53:00.874 region:rollup2
THEY PUT TO WIN BECAUSE THEY

01:52:58.839 --> 01:53:01.575 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD THEIR ELECTRICITY.

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:03.343 region:rollup2
SO.

01:53:01.575 --> 01:53:04.711 region:rollup2
I REALIZE WE STATES TO MINIMIZE

01:53:03.343 --> 01:53:06.380 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLY

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:08.415 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF

01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:09.750 region:rollup2
ALL COMMUNITIES WHETHER I MEAN I

01:53:08.415 --> 01:53:11.752 region:rollup2
HAVE FOR TREASON MY COMMUNITY

01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:13.053 region:rollup2
LET'S BE HONEST BIOMASS SHOULD

01:53:11.752 --> 01:53:16.089 region:rollup2
NOT BE ONE OF MY MAJOR ISSUES.

01:53:13.053 --> 01:53:17.591 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THAT WE

01:53:16.089 --> 01:53:19.826 region:rollup2
SHOULD TAKE ALL COMMUNITIES WE

01:53:17.591 --> 01:53:21.028 region:rollup2
REPRESENT WE WE WE LEGISLATE

01:53:19.826 --> 01:53:22.262 region:rollup2
WITH HOME IN MIND BUT WE DO

01:53:21.028 --> 01:53:23.764 region:rollup2
RIGHT REPRESENT THE WHOLE STATE

01:53:22.262 --> 01:53:25.465 region:rollup2
AND I DO THINK.

01:53:23.764 --> 01:53:27.567 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE BEEN --

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:29.169 region:rollup2
UNFAIR TO SOME RENEWABLES AND I

01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:30.871 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST ASK THAT AS YOU MOVE

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:31.972 region:rollup2
FORWARD THAT YOU TREAT ALL WHEN

01:53:30.871 --> 01:53:33.473 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT YOUR LEGISLATION

01:53:31.972 --> 01:53:34.207 region:rollup2
THAT YOU TREAT OLIVER NOBLE SO

01:53:33.473 --> 01:53:37.077 region:rollup2
SPECIAL.

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:38.745 region:rollup2
AND REALIZE THAT THAT'S THAT

01:53:37.077 --> 01:53:40.314 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE LEGISLATION

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:44.418 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS HOW WE TRULY TREAT

01:53:40.314 --> 01:53:46.453 region:rollup2
EFFORT RENEWABLE.

01:53:44.418 --> 01:53:49.156 region:rollup2
OR ANY OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE

01:53:46.453 --> 01:53:50.657 region:rollup2
TO TO COMMENT HEARING ON SENATOR

01:53:49.156 --> 01:53:52.225 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:53.660 region:rollup2
IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN CLEAR THAT

01:53:52.225 --> 01:53:56.496 region:rollup2
YOU'VE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:58.198 region:rollup2
OF FOR THIS LEGISLATURE BUT NOT

01:53:56.496 --> 01:54:01.635 region:rollup2
JUST LEGISLATURE THE ENTIRE

01:53:58.198 --> 01:54:03.937 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEYOND. TO

01:54:01.635 --> 01:54:04.838 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT WHAT IS IT MEAN TO

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:06.273 region:rollup2
GET TO A 100% WHAT DOES THAT

01:54:04.838 --> 01:54:08.942 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE.

01:54:06.273 --> 01:54:11.411 region:rollup2
WELL HOW DO WE DESIGN A PATHWAYS

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:12.446 region:rollup2
TO GET THERE AND UNDERSCORING

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:14.581 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE

01:54:12.446 --> 01:54:15.949 region:rollup2
BEEN SAID THE REASON WHY IS

01:54:14.581 --> 01:54:18.518 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH.

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:19.653 region:rollup2
A THREAT TO THE WAY THAT WE LIVE

01:54:18.518 --> 01:54:21.121 region:rollup2
THAT WAY THEY ARE GO EVEN OUR

01:54:19.653 --> 01:54:23.123 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE.

01:54:21.121 --> 01:54:24.458 region:rollup2
AND SO TO THAT UNDERSTANDING OF

01:54:23.123 --> 01:54:25.625 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT'S THAT

01:54:24.458 --> 01:54:27.494 region:rollup2
WHO WHAT IT'S DOING.

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:28.862 region:rollup2
A TO THE PLANET.

01:54:27.494 --> 01:54:30.030 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF

01:54:28.862 --> 01:54:31.898 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:34.768 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKE?

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:37.070 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY TWO S. B..

01:54:34.768 --> 01:54:38.071 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWO YOUR S. B. THREE

01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:39.673 region:rollup2
FIFTY THESE ARE ALL PART OF

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:40.774 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS THAT NEEDED TO

01:54:39.673 --> 01:54:42.743 region:rollup2
HAPPEN WE'RE TIMELY AND LATE IN

01:54:40.774 --> 01:54:44.678 region:rollup2
PLACE --

01:54:42.743 --> 01:54:46.113 region:rollup2
MARKERS THAT SORT OF GAVE US AN

01:54:44.678 --> 01:54:47.514 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO

01:54:46.113 --> 01:54:49.449 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY.

01:54:47.514 --> 01:54:51.952 region:rollup2
OF MOVE INTO THE FUTURE AND SO

01:54:49.449 --> 01:54:53.120 region:rollup2
START TO ESTABLISH OF STRATEGIES

01:54:51.952 --> 01:54:54.821 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.289 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED THE LARGER

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:57.858 region:rollup2
ISSUE AT HAND.

01:54:56.289 --> 01:55:00.227 region:rollup2
AND IN SO DOING.

01:54:57.858 --> 01:55:02.963 region:rollup2
AND IN SO DOING WE BECAME

01:55:00.227 --> 01:55:04.731 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED AS A WORLD LEADER.

01:55:02.963 --> 01:55:06.666 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE TOUGH DECISIONS WHEN

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:08.602 region:rollup2
THOSE BILLS WERE PASSED.

01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:10.404 region:rollup2
THE SAME TYPE OF OPPOSITION WAS

01:55:08.602 --> 01:55:11.705 region:rollup2
AT THE TABLE BASICALLY SAYING

01:55:10.404 --> 01:55:14.574 region:rollup2
THAT THESE ARE GOING TO BE VERY

01:55:11.705 --> 01:55:16.676 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT GOALS TO ATTAIN.

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:17.911 region:rollup2
TO BUT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:20.280 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE STILL MOVING FORWARD

01:55:17.911 --> 01:55:22.682 region:rollup2
AS WAS POINTED OUT BY ONE OF THE

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.018 region:rollup2
TESTIMONIES THAT DESCRIBED.

01:55:22.682 --> 01:55:25.786 region:rollup2
WORK IN PROGRESS UNDER THREE

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:27.788 region:rollup2
FIFTY AND NOW WE'RE SETTING A

01:55:25.786 --> 01:55:29.289 region:rollup2
NEW MARKER.

01:55:27.788 --> 01:55:31.425 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:55:29.289 --> 01:55:33.093 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS ALSO UNDERSTANDING

01:55:31.425 --> 01:55:34.728 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE NOT STOPPING.

01:55:33.093 --> 01:55:36.296 region:rollup2
WITH SP ONE HUNDRED AND ALL OF

01:55:34.728 --> 01:55:36.763 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES THAT WERE ADDRESSED

01:55:36.296 --> 01:55:38.632 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:39.266 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

01:55:38.632 --> 01:55:41.401 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE OR REAL

01:55:39.266 --> 01:55:44.304 region:rollup2
--

01:55:41.401 --> 01:55:47.541 region:rollup2
FIRE LIABILITY IT'S REAL --

01:55:44.304 --> 01:55:49.309 region:rollup2
DEPARTING CUSTOMERS IT'S REAL SO

01:55:47.541 --> 01:55:51.044 region:rollup2
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:52.445 region:rollup2
REALLY DEALING WITH SOME SERIOUS

01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:53.980 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND I THINK WE ALL

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:56.116 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.651 region:rollup2
HOW WE ADDRESS HYDRO THE VICE

01:55:56.116 --> 01:55:59.186 region:rollup2
CHAIR HAD A BILL EARLIER THIS

01:55:57.651 --> 01:56:00.287 region:rollup2
YEAR THAT THAT SHOULD BE

01:55:59.186 --> 01:56:02.656 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED --

01:56:00.287 --> 01:56:05.058 region:rollup2
IN THE CATEGORY OF RENEWABLES WE

01:56:02.656 --> 01:56:07.127 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE AREAS

01:56:05.058 --> 01:56:09.095 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO TO

01:56:07.127 --> 01:56:10.330 region:rollup2
EXPLORE AND I THINK AND WHAT YOU

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:12.165 region:rollup2
HAVE SAID AND WHAT I HEARD THE

01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:12.766 region:rollup2
EARLIER TESTIMONY AND COMMENTS

01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:15.101 region:rollup2
FROM DOCTOR THE DOCTORS EGGMAN

01:56:12.766 --> 01:56:16.369 region:rollup2
--

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:17.871 region:rollup2
AND QUIRK --

01:56:16.369 --> 01:56:19.172 region:rollup2
IT DAVID MAKER COMMITTEE VERY

01:56:17.871 --> 01:56:20.941 region:rollup2
SMART WE APPRECIATE THEIR

01:56:19.172 --> 01:56:23.643 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION BUT I THINK IT'S

01:56:20.941 --> 01:56:24.744 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE.

01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:26.680 region:rollup2
THERE ARE STILL.

01:56:24.744 --> 01:56:28.481 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE TO

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:29.382 region:rollup2
START TO BE TO REAL REALLY DRILL

01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:31.418 region:rollup2
DOWN.

01:56:29.382 --> 01:56:32.719 region:rollup2
ON MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT

01:56:31.418 --> 01:56:34.387 region:rollup2
ARE BEING RAISED TODAY

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:36.189 region:rollup2
RIGHTFULLY SO [inaudible]

01:56:34.387 --> 01:56:37.757 region:rollup2
LAST WEEK.

01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:39.259 region:rollup2
WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF DIRECT

01:56:37.757 --> 01:56:42.128 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

01:56:39.259 --> 01:56:43.363 region:rollup2
AND RAISING THE CAP ON THAT

01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:44.831 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE GOT IT IS IMPORTANT

01:56:43.363 --> 01:56:46.867 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHOICE

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:48.835 region:rollup2
BUT IN SO DOING WE MAY HAVE PUT

01:56:46.867 --> 01:56:50.403 region:rollup2
OURSELVES IN A INTERESTING PLACE

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:52.272 region:rollup2
OF WHETHER NOT THAT WOULD CAUSE

01:56:50.403 --> 01:56:53.974 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE TO RATES.

01:56:52.272 --> 01:56:55.542 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE SOME

01:56:53.974 --> 01:56:57.010 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT ARE

01:56:55.542 --> 01:56:58.278 region:rollup2
BEFORE US AND WE KNOW THAT AT

01:56:57.010 --> 01:56:59.579 region:rollup2
THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO

01:56:58.278 --> 01:57:01.815 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING.

01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:03.884 region:rollup2
A COMPREHENSIVE GOOD JOB.

01:57:01.815 --> 01:57:05.752 region:rollup2
OF BEING MINDFUL TO THE END GOAL

01:57:03.884 --> 01:57:06.987 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS REDUCING GREENHOUSE

01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:09.856 region:rollup2
GAS EMISSIONS.

01:57:06.987 --> 01:57:10.557 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LEADING.

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:12.259 region:rollup2
TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES

01:57:10.557 --> 01:57:14.394 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEFORE US.

01:57:12.259 --> 01:57:15.762 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE

01:57:14.394 --> 01:57:17.964 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL

THE ROAD YOU'LL COME BACK AND

01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:29.342 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

01:57:27.674 --> 01:57:30.944 region:rollup2
TO LINEAR INSIGHT TO WHAT WILL

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:32.746 region:rollup2
BE DEALING WITH IN THE FUTURE

01:57:30.944 --> 01:57:34.114 region:rollup2
WHICH IT DOESN'T STOP.

01:57:32.746 --> 01:57:37.984 region:rollup2
WITH THIS ACTION TODAY IT

01:57:34.114 --> 01:57:39.753 region:rollup2
CONTINUES AND TO MISTER GARTH.

AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE A A

01:57:51.865 --> 01:57:54.868 region:rollup2
STRATEGY OF HOW WE CAN MOVE

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:56.236 region:rollup2
FORWARD IS GOING TO BE A VERY

01:57:54.868 --> 01:57:56.836 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

01:57:56.236 --> 01:57:57.804 region:rollup2

AND WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:11.084 region:rollup2
THE LAST TIME YOU'LL MAKE YOUR

01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:13.053 region:rollup2
WAY TO THIS COMMITTEE WAS

01:58:11.084 --> 01:58:15.522 region:rollup2
