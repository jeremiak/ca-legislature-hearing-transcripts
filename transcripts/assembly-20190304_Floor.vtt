AND PERSECUTION.

00:42:58.208 --> 00:42:59.376
AND YET IN SPITE OF ALL OF THAT

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:02.112
IT IS ALSO A HISTORY OF VICTORY.

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:03.447
A HISTORY OF OVERCOMING

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.683
TREMENDOUS ODDS AND PUSHING THE

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:09.186
A GENERATION AND GENERATIONS.

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:10.154
FOR IT WAS SO JOURNAL TRUE TO

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.855
ASK THE CRITICAL QUESTION ON

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:14.158
BEHALF OF ALL AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:15.859
WOMEN WHO SUFFER IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.561
A NOT A WOMAN.

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.063
A QUESTION THAT WAS OFTENTIMES

00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:20.597
MISUNDERSTOOD.

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.366
BUT ONE THAT CONSTANTLY REMINDED

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.934
US THAT DESPITE WHATEVER

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:26.370
BENEFITS MAY EXIST FOR WHITE

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:27.938
WOMEN IN THIS NATION.

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:29.473
THE ATTITUDE WAS NOT THE SAME

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.375
FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN.

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.610
AND SO THEY WERE EXPECTED TO

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:35.079
BASICALLY CARRY THE LOAD MOST

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:36.547
MEN CARRY THAT WOMEN DIDN'T HAVE

00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:37.348

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:38.916

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:40.417
EVEN TO THIS DAY.

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:42.419

A NATION AND A WORLD AND THE SKY

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.757
WITH THEMSELVES.

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:48.158
MARGARET WALKER TALKS ABOUT THE

00:43:48.225 --> 00:43:49.860
FACT THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.528

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:52.463
THE WORLD.

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:54.365
BECAUSE THEY CARRY THE BURDEN

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.400
THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO CARRY.

00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:58.202
KAREN ROGERS CALLS A STURDY

GREAT DIGNITY?

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.554
AND DESPITE THE SCORE THAT THEY

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:19.023
MAY HAVE FELT HISTORICALLY.

00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:20.357
