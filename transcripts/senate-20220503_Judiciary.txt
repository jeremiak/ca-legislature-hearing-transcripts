LONG OVERDUE REFORMS TO THE MEDICARE MEDICAL INJURY COMPENSATION REFORM ACT KNOWN AS MICRO. CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL MALPRACTICE STATUTE HAS BEEN UNCHANGED FOR NEARLY FIVE DECADES AND IN THAT TIME MAGNIFIED AND EXACERBATED POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. AB THIRTY FIVE IS A COMPROMISE THAT SETTLES THESE DISPUTES MOVING FORWARD THE PROVIDE A BALANCED AND EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR PATIENTS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. CURRENT LAW LIMITS THE PLAINTIFFS NON ECONOMIC RECOVERY TWO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS REGARDLESS OF THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THE INJURED PATIENT. OR OF THE FAMILY WHOSE LOVED ONES DIED FROM MALPRACTICE. IN SUMMARY THIS HISTORIC AGREEMENT. DOES THREE THINGS. IT INCREASES THE CAP FOR NON DEATH CASES FROM THOUSAND ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND CONTINUES TO INCREASE INCREMENTALLY UNTIL WE GET TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TEN YEARS. THE CAP FOR WRONGFUL DEATH THE CASE FOR WRONGFUL DEATH CASES WOULD INCREASE FROM 200-500-0025 HUNDRED THOUSAND THE FIRST YEAR AND CONTINUES TO INCREASE INCREMENTALLY TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS AFTER TEN YEARS. SUBSEQUENT TO THE FINAL STATUTORY CAP IN TWENTY THIRTY THREE. 10% COLA WILL KICK IN STARTING ON JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY THIRTY FOUR AND WILL ADJUST THE CAPS ANNUALLY. AB THIRTY FIVE CREATES THREE SEPARATE CATEGORIES OF DEFENDANTS FOUR THREE POSSIBLE CAPS. ONE CAP FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. ONE CAP FOR HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS AND ONE CAP FOR UNAFFILIATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OR HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS THAT COMMIT A SEPARATE NEGLIGENT ACT. THIS BILL REPRESENTS THE TIRELESS WORK OF STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING PATIENTS AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS THAT CAME TOGETHER FOR THIS MONUMENTAL AGREEMENT. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO OUR JOINT AUTHOR OF AB THIRTY FIVE. SENATOR AND CHAIR. MR UMBERG WHO WILL ALSO INTRODUCE OUR WITNESSES- THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE- LET ME BEGIN BY.

INTERVENE WHEN THERE IS A BALLOT PROPOSAL TO RALEIGH I THANK YOU FOR YOUR FLEXIBILITY AND FOR YOUR CATALYST TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN STILL- THIS IS A THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE THIS IS A LONG TERM SOLUTION THAT ADDS PREDICTABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE- AND IT KEEPS HEALTH CARE ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE WHILE BALANCING APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION FOR CALIFORNIANS.

AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES AB THIRTY FIVE ESTABLISHES A NEW EVIDENTIARY PROTECTION FOR PRE LITIGATION EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY REGRET FOR NEVER ONCE AND EVEN INCLUDING. A EXPRESSIONS OF FAULT. INCLUDING THE BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THIS WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS TO HAVE A FULL AND OPEN CONVERSATION AFTER AN UNFORESEEN OUTCOME AND WILL LEAD TO GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY PATIENT SAFETY AND TRUST.

NO ONE ISSUE AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WITH THAT BEING CONDUCTED- WE ARE NOW MOVING IN THIS MATTER BRING IT BEFORE THE DAIS CENTER LAYERED AND INCINERATES BURKE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR. ACTUALLY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR I WAS HIRED TO BE THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES ANALYST FOR THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AT THE TIME SENATOR- BURKE REALLY WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AS WE FACED RIGHT AWAY THE FACT THAT. DOCTORS WERE GOING THEIR- OWN INSURANCE THAT WERE OBGYN SAYS A. COUNTY WE WERE HIRING NURSE MIDWIVES TO TRY TO CONTINUE THE SERVICES THE CRISIS THAT MICROCOSM FROM. WHETHER THEY'RE STILL DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER WAS MANIPULATED IN SOME WAY BUT WAS REAL. AND YET WHEN THE CAP WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE PURCHASING POWER IS NOW SOMETHING LIKE 25% OF WHAT THAT SAME AMOUNT WAS. IN THAT YEAR AND FOR THOSE OF US HERE ARE WE'VE EXPERIENCED THIS AS A POLITICAL FAULT LINE IT TOO WHEN I RAN FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TEN THERE WAS A MAJOR INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE AGAINST ME BECAUSE I ADVOCATED INDEXING THIS JUST INDEXING GET. BEEN IN TWENTY TWENTY MY POSITION WAS EVERYBODY SHOULD BE AT THE TABLE TO DISCUSS THIS AND GET TO A SOLUTION AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE. AND IT IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK ALL OF US HAD ALWAYS HOPED FOR BUT NEVER THOUGHT WAS TRUE IMPOSSIBLE. THEN SO I REALLY SALUTE EVERYONE BECAUSE- HEY YOU COULD NEVER KEEP A SECRET IN SACRAMENTO AND THIS WAS FOR SOME REASON CAPT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF RISK TAKING HERE. MY SUSPICION IS IF THIS PROPOSAL HAD BEEN LEAKED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS. ARE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF GROUPS THAT TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT THAT WOULD HAD A REAL TOUGH TIME HOLDING THEIR CONSTITUENTS TOGETHER FOR IT. AND I THINK WHEN THERE WAS A GIVE AND TAKE THAT WAS REALLY GOOD AND REALLY EVERYBODY GOT SOMETHING OUT OF IT AND IT WAS ENOUGH FOR THE INITIATIVE NOT TO GO. TO NOVEMBER IT IS A MASSIVE VICTORY AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT HI HOPE BECAUSE THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY AND HOW THIS WILL. WILL INDEX GOING FORWARD THAT THIS REMOVED SAYS AN ISSUE EVEN AND YEARS OR FURTHER ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE ALWAYS HAS THE RIGHT. TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE AND SEE IF THEY WARRANT. ANY CONSIDERATION. AND I WAS ALL SET AT THIS MOMENT. TO SPEAK TO THOSE THAT OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE. OF WHICH THERE WERE NONE. BECAUSE I WAS PREPARED TO SAY AND EVEN IF THERE'S ONE OUT THERE LISTENING. IS THAT BASICALLY. WHATEVER THE POSITION WAS THAT PEOPLE HAD SO STRONGLY THAT THEY WOULD OPPOSE THIS MEASURE IS THE REASON THERE NEVER BEEN A SOLUTION SINCE IT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. THAT IT REALLY TOOK SOME GIVE AND TAKE IT RALLY TOOK EVERYBODY PROTECTING THEIR OWN INTERESTS SO THAT. THE PROVIDERS FEEL SOME LEVEL OF PROTECTION BUT CONSUMERS ABSOLUTELY GET A LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT'S A STAKEHOLDER WAS INVOLVED IN THIS. SO I JUST I AM PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THIS. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU. THAT WONDER WHY. IN THE NEXT WEEK I WILL BE PRESENTING A BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR THAT IS ABOUT. TWO DIFFERENT FONTS OF THE PENAL CODE IT'S BECAUSE I WAS HOLDING IT FOR THIS PURPOSE IT AND SO I THINK IT WILL. IT WILL- MAYBE CENTER DRAWS SO WE'LL GET HER LABOR BILL ON CLIMATE OUT OF THE PHONE BILLS OR SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN BUT I JUST WANT TO SALUTE EVERYBODY THERE IT IS AMAZING AND- AND IT FOR ANYONE THAT SAYS. SACRAMENTO DOESN'T WORK. AFTER WE PASS THIS BILL AND SIGNED INTO LAW WE SHOULD POINT EVERYBODY TO THIS BECAUSE OF THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS MADE AND EVERYBODY'S HANDS IN. IN THE FACT THAT IT WAS DONE IN A WAY THAT NOT A PERSONAL POSTED IT IN THIS HEARING SO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. ASSEMBLY WILLING TO MOVE THIS I'M PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CALL THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED AND I WAS PREPARED TO PAY FOR YOUR PHONE BILL. AS A BILL THROUGH COMMITTEE. MOVING ON TO CENTER HERTZBERG CONSIDER WHAT CASK. I WANT TO JUST IF I COULD THE- SAN LAYERED TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SECOND WORKING. IN OUR GOVERNMENT WORKING I DO AGREE WITH THE HISTORY BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE AT A POINT IN HISTORY ONE REFLECT ON THOSE WHO WERE HERE BEFORE AND WITH THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS WERE BUT I THINK. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS THAT ISN'T INFORMED BY. THE SUBJECT MATTER WE HAVE BEFORE US BUT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO MAKING GOVERNMENT WORK. IS THIS EFFORT BY SENATOR STEINBERG CENTER VIDEO CENTER DELEON SOME YEARS AGO IN COORDINATION WITH JUSTICE ROSSO INJURED CHIEF JUSTICE STRONG GEORGIAN OTHERS. IT BROUGHT BACK THIS INDIRECT INITIATIVE WHEN MR RALLY FAR FOOTBALLER NICK FULL OF FILED THIS MEASURE UNDER THE LAW BEFORE THE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THERE TO BE DISCUSSION BECAUSE ONCE THOSE BOXES OF SIGNATURES WHEN ACROSS THE DESK- THEY THEY WERE- HE WAS ON THE MEASURE WAS ON THE BALLOT THAT WAS THE LAW. CURRENTLY BEING USED TO ALWAYS BE LONG CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT PROCESS SO THAT IT ALLOWS FOR DISCUSSION BETWEEN A PROPONENT. OF A AND THE ADVOCATES THE LEGISLATURE THE PROCESS TO TRY TO GET THE LAW RIGHT BUT I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO RECOGNIZE IN THAT LARGER DYNAMIC. ALSO THIS YOU KNOW THE POINT THAT WAS MADE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SEVENTY FOUR CERTAINLY WE CAN'T FORGET HELEN THOMPSON WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE YOU CHANGE YOURSELF TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK SOME YEARS AGO AND SEVENTY FIVE. DOLLARS AND REPORTER ONE TROUBLE PASSED AWAY RECENTLY AND OTHERS WHO WERE PART OF THAT WOULD BE BROWN'S G. THOMPSON AND OTHERS WERE PART OF THE HISTORY- THAT IT FOR THIS AND THAT IS BEING BEFORE TODAY. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT AGAIN ALSO PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE. REALLY REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THE ALL THE ADVOCATES CAME TOGETHER THE CATALYST THANK YOU PROVIDE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN TO YOU YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW GIGANTIC OF THE ROLE YOU PLAYED IN ALL OF THE STUFF. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF HOW THIS DISPLACED WORKS AND SO YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO GIVE CREDIT TO OTHERS AND I WANT TO A ONE OH TO THE EXTENT SEND A MESSAGE TO FUTURE LEGISLATORS. THAT THINK ABOUT THE PROCESS- THINK CIVILITY TO REMOTE TO CREATE THIS INDIRECT INITIATIVE AS A TOOL LIKE WE DID WITH- BUDGETS THAT WE WANT 250% PLUS ONE WHAT WE DID ON TERM LIMITS- CENTER DRIVE SO AND OTHER THINGS THAT WERE DONE. A RAINY DAY FUNDS. AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE OFFICE THE BIG GUY. COM FOR THE CHOIR. ON EXCITING STUFF THAT DOESN'T YOU ON THE PHONE PAGE THE NEWSPAPER. PUT THAT IN FOR. THE LET'S. AND GOVERNMENT PROCESS IN A WAY. THAT ALLOWS THINGS TO HAPPEN LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE TODAY IS THE RESULT OF THE HARD WORK. OF FANCY TRAVELLING THE ENTRAPMENT IS. LISA MARSHALL OTHERS THAT ARE HERE THAT FELT REALLY GOT INTO INTO THE PROCESS AND- SO I JUST WANNA THANK EVERYBODY AND- YOU KNOW TO NOT FORGET THE HISTORY FROM WHERE WE COME. AND THE LESSON ABOUT GOVERNMENT REFORM HAS VALUE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S A BIG DEAL WHEN IT HAPPENS IT MANIFESTS ITSELF. IN IN DAYS LIKE TODAY SO THAT TO ALSO PARTICIPATES THE AUTHORS BOTH HOUSES. I APPRECIATE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE HAVE THE TIME TO ESPECIALLY OPINION THANK YOU. SIR WHAT BECAUSE HE THEN SENATOR ALSO. BROUGH TOLD PROPONENTS PROBABLY TO THE PROCESS. BRAVO TO THE BALLOT HOLDER I THOUGHT THE STAFF REPORT WHISKEY. WHEN WE WHEN YOU BACK TO JURY ONE FIRST THE SECOND DAY OF SESSION HE HAS SENDS A NINE POINT- EXTRA A REQUEST FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION TO COME IN AND- PEOPLE FORGET HOW THINGS WORK IN THE- IN THE SEVENTIES. AS FAR AS GETTING IT DONE MY QUESTION GOES TO TWO QUESTIONS FIRST IS TO THE FEES. WE GOT A BUNCH OF LAWYERS HAVE ALREADY SIGNED CONTRACTS FOR PEOPLE THERE IN SOME OF SOME OF THESE CASES TAKE. TWO THREE TEN YEARS. THIS THEY GET TO STAY GET TO JUDGMENT THEY GO TO TRIAL THEY GO THERE THEY'VE GOT A FEW GREEN WHICH IS INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE NEW LAW WOULD BE WHAT HAPPENS PRACTICALLY. DESCRIPTION THE DESCRIPTION. I'D LIKE TO ELLSBERG I'D LIKE TO L. SHOULD ONLY ASSUME WAGNER THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR CMA. GOOD AFTERNOON ATTORNEYS FEES CHANGES WILL GO INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO THEY WOULD IMPACT EXISTING CASES D. THAT CHANGES TO THE CAP ON NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES WILL ONLY APPLY TO CASES FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE QUESTION BUT SHE SAID RIGHT AND THEN THE THREE CATEGORIES THE THREE CARE CATEGORIES- AS FAR AS A CAUSE OF ACTION. BASICALLY SAME QUESTION YOU HAVE CASES THAT ARE GOING ON NOW THAT YOU HAVE ONE MATT MEDICAL MALPRACTICE JUDGMENT FOR AN INSTITUTION A NOT IN. AN INDIVIDUAL PLAN OF. AND LET'S SAY YOU'RE STILL IN TRIAL CAN YOU AMEND YOUR COMPLAINT- ON JANUARY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. NO THE AB THIRTY FIVE- STATES EXPRESSLY THAT THE NEW CAP STRUCTURE ONLY APPLIES TO A CIVIL ACTIONS FILED IN DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION MADE ON OR AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO IT'S IT DOESN'T APPLY TO CASES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PIPELINE IF YOU WELL. AND THAT IS. INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BUILD UP THE TEN YEAR WALK UP STRUCTURE IT WAS A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS NEGOTIATION. SO THAT FOR THE A PRACTITIONER THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD. TEMPER THAT IS WHEN YOUR ONE YEAR BECAUSE OF ACTION EXPIRES THAT YOU HAVE TO FILE YOUR CASE RIGHT. I MEAN I WOULD IMAGINE IF SOMEBODY'S INJURED RIGHT NOW HE WOULD HAVE THAT THERE BE MOTIVATION TO WAIT TILL. TWENTY TWENTY THREE OBVIOUSLY. OKAY IS PRESUMABLY A- PRISON. THANK YOU. THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR OTHER THAN CENTER JONES. I JUST WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE WHO PUT THE TIME AND THE ENERGY INTO IT. AND IT'S A IT'S A LESSON TO THAT NOT ALL OF THE BEST SOLUTIONS COME THROUGH GOVERNMENT. OF DOING THIS PROCESS THAT- FROM THAT KIND OF PRIVATE CONVERSATION AMONGST THE- NON GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES WHO HAVE THE MOST. AT STAKE- ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT. CAN BE MOVED FORWARD SO CONGRATULATIONS CENTER DRAWS ARE TOOK MY COMMENTS SO I WILL- A SECOND HER COMMENTS AND THEN ALSO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES BUT- SCENARIOS. SYNDROME BURKE CONGRADULATIONS SUMMARIES WE SPOKE ABOUT BEING ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR LAST WEEK SO- UNLESS I HAD BEEN DONE YET I STILL WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR. AFTER THIS GREAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK THERE'S OTHER- SENATORS THAT WANT TO BE ADDED ON TO THAT THING A CHANCE TO BE A- CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FOR SO I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STAKEHOLDERS TO- AFTER DECADES OF A TRENCH WARFARE CAME TOGETHER AND DECIDED TO RESOLVE- TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND- I. THESE FIGHTS CAN BECOME BECOME PERSONAL- I DON'T KNOW THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR HAS JUST BEEN SO INTENSEFOR SO LONG BUT I WONDERED IF IT WAS EVER GOING TO BE RESOLVED I THINK ALL OF US WHO GAVE ANY THOUGHT TO THIS COMPRISED THINKING TWENTY DIFFERENT WAYS TO COMPROMISE ON MY GROUND I ALWAYS. WONDERED WHY THERE WASN'T A COMPROMISE LIKE FROM THE TIME I STARTED RUNNING FOR THE SENATE AND REALLY STARTED FOCUSING MORE ON MY CRY WAS ALWAYS LIKELY TO SEEMS LIKE SO RIGHT FOR A COMPROMISE BUT THE WAR WAS JUST SO INTENSE AND SO I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND EVERYONE WHO PUT ALL OF THAT HISTORY ASIDE AND ALL THE PAIN RIGHT BECAUSE MANY THINKWHAT MY CREDIT IS IT'S ABOUT SITUATIONS WHERE SOMEONE CAUSES SOMEONE ELSE FORM- OFTEN. DEADLY HARM OR THE MOST SEVERE LIKE LIFE PERMANENT LIFE ALTERING HARMS AND VERY VERY PERSONAL- FOR EVERYONE. AND SO I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL THAT EVERYONE PUT THAT TO THE SIDE AS PAINFUL AND HARD AS IT WAS IN CAME TOGETHER. SO LET'S DO SOMETHING FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. TO TAKE THIS ALMOST FIFTY YEAR OLD LOG MODERNIZE IT AND ALL UP TO YOU TO. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE HARMED- CAN ACTUALLY GET REASONABLE- COMPENSATION AND TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE ACTUALLY ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FULLY PROVIDE. HEALTH CARE SERVICES AT ALL INCOME LEVELS IN THE STATE I'M SORRY JUST ONE AGAIN SAID THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WISH TO COMMENT. I HAVE NOT DONE SO PRIOR. SEEING NONE- SYNDROME BURKE SIMMER REYES- FINAL COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU AGAIN SOME IN THE RACE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE- A COUPLE OF BRIEF THOUGHTS BEFORE SAID WHITE HOUSE USING OF THE QUESTIONS. WE WANT TO DELAY THINGS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF GOVERNMENT WORKING AND I'M PROUD TO BE PART OF THAT EXAMPLE GOVERNMENT WORKING- IN THIS IS A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO MR JOHNSON. FOR COMING FORWARD ANDUSING YOUR GRIEF. AS A TOOL TO BRING FOLKS TOGETHER SO THANK YOU TO YOU AND ALL THOSE WHO CALLED IN WHO. DISCUSSED AND REVEALED AND USE THAT GRIEF TO MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD SO THANK YOU TO ALL- IN WITH THAT ALLERGEN I VOTE. ALL RIGHTY WE HAVE A MOTION EARLIER MADE BY CENTER LAYER TO MOVE THE APOLOGIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU I DIDN'T WANT CENTER ON BURKE TO GIVE HIS CLOTHES FIRST I ALSO WANT TO THANK. ALL THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED WAS A LOT OF WORK. AND IT WAS WORK THAT YOU ALL DID BECAUSE YOU KNEW HOW IMPORTANT THE ISSUE WAS YOU KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO MORE REASON FOR THERE TO BE.

FIRST I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR PROFUSELY. OUR WORK WORKING WITH ME TO GET THIS MEASURE TO WHERE IT IS TODAY. THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGES ELEVEN TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT WILL FURTHER CLARIFY OR ADD CLARITY TO THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT. THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMITTEE AND STAFF ELEVEN EIGHTEEN CODIFIES LANGUAGE FROM THE SUPREME COURT CASE. IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD THE PRINCIPLE THAT INSUBSTANTIAL OR MERELY TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS. ARE NOT GROUNDS FOR RELIEF. THIS CHANGE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR TO STATE AGENCIES AND THE COURTS THAT MINOR INCONSEQUENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF SYKORA WILL NOT BE GROUNDS FOR RELIEF AND THAT ABSOLUTE PERFECTION IN PREPARING AN ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT UNDER SEQUEL. THE CALIFORNIA BAR MIDDLE QUALITY ACT WAS ENACTED OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO TO ENSURE THAT STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THEIR DECISIONS WHEN APPROVING PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PROJECTS. AND WHILE THIS LAW HAS UNDOUBTEDLY DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN PROTECTING AND CONSERVING THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES IT IS ALSO BEEN USED TO FACILITATE COSTLY IN NEEDLESS LITIGATION- FOR. ENVIRONMENTALLY ON RELATED TECHNICAL MISTAKES. AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THIS IS NOT AN EARTH SHATTERING BILL WE KNOW THAT ELEVEN EIGHTEEN SIX TO BRING HARMONY TO CALIFORNIA'S COURTS AND UPHOLD THE CRUCIAL PRINCIPLE. THAT INSTANCE INSUBSTANTIAL WERE TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS ARE NOT THEMSELVES GROUND FOR RELIEF UNDER SEQUEL. IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT IS CRITICAL WE FIND THE BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR STATE AND MANAGE THE ONGOING HOUSING CHALLENGES WE ARE CURRENTLY FACING- WE HAVE NO BY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT- TODAY- SO WE COULD JUST OPEN IT UP IF IT SECURES DESIRE TO THE PUBLIC OUR- THE THIRD- PRINCIPAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT.

I'M GOING TO NOTE THAT DEFINITIVA BILLS PREMISED ON THE ABUSE OF DISCRETION STANDARD THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN NEIGHBORS FIRST MORRELL HOWEVER BUT NO TWO OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION STATE SPECIFICALLY THAT THE ABUSE OF DISCRETION INSPECTION OF THE DECISION DOES NOT REFLECT THE MAJORITY.

THERE'S NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. PODERIA IF THERE'S ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINE IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. ONE ONE ONE EIGHT. THERE'S NO ONE EIGHTY WITH ALREADY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE- QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEEING IN MANY- THE FIRST LET'S START WITH SENATOR LATER THAN CENTER WHAT CAL SKI. MY QUESTION IS IF THE AUTHOR OR POSSIBLY THE CHAIR. COULD DETAILS THE AMENDMENTS AND WHAT THEY DID TO THIS. BECAUSE I CAME IN VERY SKEPTICAL OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THE AMENDMENTS CHANGE THAT IT AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND CLEARLY WHAT THEIR M. IMPACT WAS. ORGAN TO ARTICULATE OUT THE SPECIFIC MINISTER GO AHEAD. YES IN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN JUDICIARY IN THE EQ COMMITTEE THERE IS NEVER CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THIS BILL CREATED SOME- INCONSISTENCIES WITHIN SEQUOIA AND SO. THOSE INCONSISTENCIES WE BELIEVE HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AND WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS DO NOW IS SIMPLY STATE THAT. IN INTERPRETING SEQUEL IT IS IN THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. THAT INSUBSTANTIAL VIOLATIONS ARE TECHNICAL MISSIONS NOT BE GROUNDS FOR RELIEF AND- THAT'S THE BIG PART OF WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS TO IT JUST SIMPLY STATES. IN IN TENT THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE COURTS INTERPRET SYKORA IN THIS WAY AND THEN THERE'S ALSO- I MEANT- ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS SIMPLY STATES THAT IT IS. THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS LANGUAGE FROM THE SMART REAL CASE BE CODIFIED. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE AMENDMENTS IN A NUTSHELL pVERY SIMPLE BILL NOW. BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY WILL DOWN ALTHOUGH I'M ALWAYS SCARED OF THE ONES THAT ARE THE MOST SIMPLE BILLS BUT A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITIONAL STATEMENT AND THE- ANALYSIS FROM ONE OF THE OPPONENTS THAT SAID- THIS WAS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM SO COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT POINT. HI I AM NOT CERTAIN I COULD DISAGREE MORE RESPECTFULLY BUT WITH CERTAINTY- THAT SECRET WE JUST WENT THROUGH A VERY AMAZING DISCUSSION ON- ON MICHAEL. RIGHT WE HAD TO FLY TO NEW YORK COUNTERVAILING FORCES COMING TOGETHER. I THINK THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR NEAR NEAR THAT LEAK BUT ANYTIME YOU WANT TO ADDRESS SEQUEL IMMEDIATELY THE PARTY ARE MOVING INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS. AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THE PAST IS THAT. INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE WISHING TO OPPOSE ANY IMPROVEMENT TO SEE WHAT. AND FOR EXAMPLE I USED TO BE THE- CHAIRMAN OF THE- SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY FOR MANY YEARS. SO I HAVE A- IN ENVIRONMENTAL BENT. SICK WHAT IS A DOCUMENT THAT CAN DO WITH SOME IMPROVEMENT AND I THINK EVEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS IDENTIFIED THAT ONE AREA THAT WON'T OBVIATE ANY EXISTING RIGHTS SUPPORT LEGAL PROTECTIONS IS SIMPLY TO IDENTIFY. THAT IF THERE ARE TECHNICAL- BIOLASE. OR TECHNICAL ERRORS. THAT ARE NON PREJUDICIAL THAT WE'D BE IN THIS POSITION TO ALLOW FOR A DOCUMENT- TO BE REVIEWED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTER TO BE REVIEWED- IN THAT LIGHT. IN NOT STOPPAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE MAYBE SOMEONE DIDN'T HAVE A COMMON THE RIGHT SPOT. WELL IF I CAN MAKE A COMMENT MISTER CHAIR UP YOU MIGHT HAVE PICKED THE WRONG EXAMPLE. BECAUSE I WAS A MEMBER OF THAT CONSERVANCY BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS AND SENT SOMEBODY AND WITH SECURITATE ID ONE SICK WHAT WAS IGNORED- ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT WAS IN THE CENTER OF THAT CONSERVANCY FOR A LONG TIME. WE SPOKE WEEKS WE SPONSORED AND SUPPORTED- ON THE SECRET ROCESS- WITH UTMOST VILLAGE ON- VISUAL ANSWER IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY. BECAUSE YOU DO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY YOU CAN'T HAVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WITHOUT. IDENTIFYING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IT'S THAT SIMPLE. AND THAT IS CLEAR THE IDEAS WHETHER NOT IT'S USED IN WAYS THAT. YOU BETTER- TERRIER I THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT I LOOK FORWARD THE QUOTE IN THE FIRST HALF OF IT REGULARLY. THANK YOU FOR THE PLAN IS A IS A FOLLOW ON TO YOUR QUESTION THE. AMENDMENTS- CLOSELY ALONG. THE WITH THE HOLD IN NEIGHBORS FOR SMART REAL VERSUS EXPOSITION. METROLINE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO THAT'S WE WANT TO DO IS TO BASICALLY CODIFIED THAT DID MINOR- MINISTERIAL ISSUES WOULD NOT BE REASON. TO INVALIDATE THE E. I. R. SO. ARE CENTER WHAT HOUSE HE. I DID SUPPORT THIS MEASURE IN- ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THIS ANALYSIS BEFORE IT WOULD HAVE JUMPED OFF THAT BOAT BACK IN THE QUEUE BUT- I LEFT FILE MY VOTES MY QUESTION IS THAT. IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A DISTINCTION TO BE MADE WITH CODIFYING NEIGHBOR I GET THAT FOR THESE MINOR BITS BUT THIS IS EXTENDING IT TO ALL ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS WHAT IS A NOTICE OF DEFAULT OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS AND NOT USE. THE GRAND ENCHILADA D. E. I. R. WHICH IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THESE OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT ARE YOU KNOW NOT A FULL E. I. R. WOULD BE SWEPT UP IN THE- THIS BILL AS AMENDED. WELL IN ALL IN ALL LEAVE OPEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORGAN TO COMMENT FURTHER- THAT I. IN THE IR IS GOING TO HAVE A COMPANY DOCUMENTS IN SO WHAT'S IT WHAT HAPPENS I THINK OVER TIME. IS THAT CERTAIN OTHER PARALLEL- SUBMISSIONS- FEDERAL PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OR THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT IS REVIEWING THE MATTERS BEFORE IT OR REGULATORY ENTITY. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY SIMILAR. N OUR EXPECTATION THROUGH THIS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT A MERE TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS SHOULDN'T OBVIATE- THE- THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE ER. OR DEFEAT FOR THE PERIL DOCUMENTATION THAT COULD GO ALONG WITH THAT. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT THAT PROCESS YOU GO THROUGH AND THE SEQUEL THAT RELEVANT INFORMATION IS THE PUBLIC COULD BE DEPRIVED OF THAT ARE NOT DEPRIVED OF THAT IF THERE. IF THESE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS TO DETERMINE TO BE MERE TECHNICAL ERRORS I MEAN IF YOU KNOW IN AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS- IF THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS OF CONCERN- TO YOU SENATOR HI. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK FURTHER INTO THAT AND IF FOR FURTHER REFINEMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY- I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT- I WILL I WILL MAKE CORRESPONDING CHANGES. JUST AS I'VE MADE THE- THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE HAVE RECOMMENDED BE MADE IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD. I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO SO AS WELL. OKAY THE OTHER OF OBJECTION OR THE OTHER CONCERN IS FOOTNOTES TO SO I APOLOGIZE I DID NOT READ FOOTNOTE TO ON THIS I THINK THIS DECISION BUT TALKS ABOUT THE MERCH MAJORITY OF THE SUPREME COURT DIDN'T. DIDN'T COME TOGETHER MORALITY AND WHAT IS THE- ABUSE OF DISCRETION THAT'S USED ON THAT. AND WHETHER IT'S- SUBSTANTIAL MOSTLY SUBSTANTIAL AND SIGNIFICANT AS A WHOLE. RAINBOW OF DIFFERENT- HI DECISIONS THAT THEY CAN BE FULL PICKING FOUR ONE N. I'M WONDERING THAT'S STILL IN THE BILL. RIGHT. AND I'M I'M WONDERING- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH. THIS NEW DEFINITION WHY DO WE NEED THIS NEW DEFINITION IF PRACTITIONERS COULD RELY ON NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR DECISION ANYWAY. WELL THIS LANGUAGE FROM THE NEIGHBORS DECISION IS PERSUASIVE BUT IS STRICTLY SPEAKING NOT BINDING ON LOWER COURTS BECAUSE IT WAS FROM A PLURALITY OPINION IN THIS DECISION SO THERE WAS NO MAJORITY THE COURT THAT SIGNED ON TO THIS LANGUAGE AND PRACTITIONERS IN THIS FIELD. HAVE POINTED TO THIS LANGUAGE AND SAID IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE HELPFUL IF WAS. IF IT WAS BINDING- THERE HAVE BEEN CASES THERE HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED DECISIONS AND SOME- PUBLISHED DECISIONS THAT HAVE RELIED ON THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ABOUT FIVE PUBLISHED DECISIONS FIVE ON PUBLISHERS SESSION SO THEY HAVE USED IT BUT IT'S- STRICTLY SPEAKING NOT BINDING ON THE LOWER COURTS BECAUSE AGAIN IT IT WAS A PLURALITY OPINION SO THAT'S- PART OF THE REASON WHY- WE- BROUGHT THIS BUT WE WORK ON THIS BILL BECAUSE IT JUST. SEEMS HELPFUL TO ELEVATE THIS LANGUAGE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S APPLICABLE TO ALL PROJECTS AND ALL COURTS LOOKING AT THIS BUT DOESN'T THAT DROP OUT SOME OF THE CLAIMS THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE ON WHETHER THE IT SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS. ON THE ENVIRONMENT VERSUS. I GUESS MERELY LACK OF- BY SHOWING A LACK OF. USE OF DISCRETION. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT. YOU WANT TO SEE THE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS AND WHETHER IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT BECAUSE PROPONENTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT DISCUSS FIRST IS WHETHER THE- TRIER OF. HIS ABUSING THEIR DISCRETION OR ALLEGED OF ABUSING THEIR DISCRETION RIGHT. WELL THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE DECISION AND I THINK THIS IS THE IT GOES INTO THE BILL TO THAT LANGUAGE FROM- THE CASE THAT TALKS ABOUT. WHAT IS A AND IT'S SUBSTANTIAL. OR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS THEY SPEAK TO WHETHER YOU KNOW IT. IT IT DEPRIVES THE PUBLIC OF SUBSTANTIAL RELEVANT INFORMATION ARE PROJECTS SO THAT IS THE DETERMINATION THAT THE COURTS WOULD LIKELY MAKE. IN DETERMINING IN IN DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO ISSUE RELIEF THEY WOULDN'T YOU KNOW NECESSARILY. DENY SOMEONE THE CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR CASE THEY WOULD. YOU KNOW LET BOTH SIDES. PRESENT THEIR SIDE AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THAT DETERMINATION WHAT WAS THERE. WAS A SUBSTANTIAL VIOLATION OR A TECHNICAL VIOLATION OF THE SENATE SO I GUESS I GUESS THE OPPOSITION THIS IS SAYING THAT THESE THIS IS ANOTHER LAYER THAT'S PART PUTTING INTO THIS- SUBJECTIVE STANDARDS FOR THESE FAKE STANDARDS. IN DETERMINING A SEQUEL VIOLATIONS WHO IS PREJUDICIAL MAY HAVE. ADD MORE CONFUSION RATHER THAN CLARIFICATION THAT'S OPPOSITION. I'M AND I'M I THINK A AS WE'VE SEEN THIS THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD AND WE'VE SEEN OTHER- BILLS- THERE IS A THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A REFLEX THAT OCCURS- WHERE MATTERS CAN BE- CONFUSED- BUT IN REAL TERMS- ARE NOT CONFUSING I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY ABOUT AS CLEAR. A SITUATION AS YOU CAN HAVE WHERE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION HAS LANGUAGE THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO CODIFY THAT IS INSTRUCTIVE IN NATURE. AND I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AND WHY IT HAS ACHIEVED SUCCESS IS BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS EVEN THOSE WHO ARE NATURAL PROPONENTS OF PROTECTING THE SANK WITH SANCTITY OF SYKORA. UNDERSTAND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A DEGREE OF COMMON SENSE AND REASONABLENESS WHEN IT COMES TO INSUBSTANTIAL OR TECHNICAL ODD OUTSIDE ISSUES THAT COULD DERAIL. A PROCESS FOR MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER. ALREADY THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS SIX I'M SORRY CENTER STERN. I APOLOGIZE IF YOU YOU'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THIS MISTER CHAIR OR MEMBERS BUT- WHAT WHAT WHAT IN YOUR MIND IS A MERELY TECHNICAL VIOLATION. WHAT'S ON THIS REALLY FOR ME TO DECIDE OF COURSE THAT IS FOR- JURISTE GUY IN THE AND THOSE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS- TO- JUDICATA- THE OR REVIEW AT LEAST- SO LEAVE IT UP TO THEM TO THEM BUT I THINK FROM A COMMON. FROM A COMMON SENSE APPROACH APPROACH IN APPRECIATION THIS ISSUE IS THAT ANY I. R. IS A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED DOCUMENT REVIEWING IT COULD BE WINDISCH USER COULD BE WATER ISSUES A COULD BE- GROUND RELATED ISSUES HIGHLY HIGHLY TECHNICAL IN NATURE SO IF THERE MIGHT BE A TECHNICAL VIOLATION. OF A OF HELP PARTICULAR STUDY WAS CONDUCTED OR THE OUTCOME OF THAT STUDY BUT IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT GERMANE TO THE ISSUE AT HAND. THAT COULD POPS POSSIBLY PERHAPS BE A TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT IT OFFERS NO PREJUDICIAL EFFECT. SO TECH A TECHNICAL VIOLATION THAT'S NOT GERMANE TO THE ISSUE IT. WHEN YOU THINK OF A TECH LIKE IF THERE'S A MISTAKE IN THE AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS AROUND A MAJOR PROJECT THAT SAYS IT'LL HAVE X. AMOUNT OF IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY BUT IT REALLY WILL HAVE Y. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE A DIRECT THAT WOULD THAT THAT WOULD BE A DIRECT A DIRECT ISSUE. BUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW- TECHNICAL PET CAPACITIES AND PROCESSES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW D. I THINK THE VERY IDEA IS YOU KNOW WAS THIS PARTICULAR SECTION- LOCATED IN THE DOCUMENT APPROPRIATELY. YOU KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER BUT ONCE AGAIN IT'S UP TO DATE IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE- IN THOSE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS TO MAKE CERTAINLY SPECULATE ALL DAY LONG ALL DAY LONG BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT ACOMMON SENSE AND REASONABLE STANDARD THAT IS INHERENT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WRITTEN OPINION. LET ME INTERVENE FOR JUST A SECOND AND DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ANALYSIS PAGE TWELVE OF FIFTEEN IF YOU LOOK AT AMENDMENT THREE- SUB V. THERE'S FURTHER DEFINITION HERE SO FOR EXAMPLE WELL- LET'S READ IT IT'S- IS FOR THE INTENT THE LEGISLATURE THAT IN UNDERTAKING JUDICIAL REVIEW PURSUANT TO SECTIONS. 211-682-1168 POINT FIVE COURT SHALL FIND. THAT INSUBSTANTIAL OR MERELY TECHNICAL MISSIONS ARE NOT GROUNDS. FOR LEAVE THAT IN A MISSION. BASICALLY NEW PHRASE. AND OUR MISSION AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ANALYSIS IS PRESIDENT PREJUDICIAL IF IT DEPRIVE THE PUBLIC. AND DECISION MAKERS OF SUBSTANTIAL RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECTS LIKELY ADVERSE IMPACTS SO AND IF THAT HELPS YOU SENATOR STERN TERMS OF. CREATING GUIDANCE FOR COURT AS TO WHAT'S TECHNICAL WAS NOT TECHNICAL AND WHAT ASPECTS OF THE REVIEW- ARE REVIEWED FOR EXAMPLE- SUBSTANTIAL RELEVANT INFORMATION BEING OMITTED VERSUS MERELY- TECHNICAL MISSIONS. BUT MY CONCERN AND MY HANG UP WITH THE BILL REMAINS THAT IT FOR TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY IN LAW BY CODIFYING DECISION BUT THEN THERE'S THIS VAGUENESS AROUND IT THAT IT'S OPEN ENDED AND GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND WE'RE GETTING NO FURTHER CLARITY AT THE LAW I DON'T KNOW WHY. WOULD BE PASSING A BILL TO FURTHER ADD VAGARIES TO AN ALREADY. SORT OF ALREADY PRETTY OPEN ENDED STANDARD THAT THOSE BRIGHTLY ALLOW COURTS SOME DISCRETION THAT REGARD I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION MR CHER BUT I EIGHT. FROM THE AUTHORS DESCRIPTION. YET MERE TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS SEEMS DIDN'T INDICATE THERE'S A DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION OF TECHNICAL VIOLATION LIKE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS WHEN THE- SUBSTANTIAL IN THAT OR NOT SO. I CAN'T SUPPORT THE MEASURE AGAIN TODAY BUT I APPRECIATE THE WORK THE COMMITTEES DOWN IN THE BILL. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SAYING NONE IS THERE MOTION. SENATE JONES MOST THE BILL ALL RIGHT. SURFBOARDS CARE CLOSE- YES AND NO I WILL BE BRIEF- I DO WANT TO WOULD TO LET CENTER STERN KNOW THAT- IF HE HAS RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE- OF A BILL LIKE THIS I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE TO WORK WELL WITH YOU AND EARN YOUR SUPPORT IN IN IN THIS PROCESS- AS I MENTIONED IN OF OUR MENTAL QUALITY WHEN IT PASSED OUT OF INVERNAL QUALITY. IT WAS THAT THERE IS A BALANCE HERE THAT IS THAT PROTECTS THE SANCTITY OF SEACOR AND ADDS A DEGREE OF REASONABLENESS SO THAT- THAT THE COURT CAN RELY UPON THE PRESIDENT- IN THE SUPREME COURT CASE IN A MORE CLEAR AND- DIRECTIONAL WAY AND- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THIS BILL TODAY I KNOW THAT- IF SHOULD TO PASS HERE I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO WORK WITH THAT CENTER WHAT CAL SKI. ON ANY- RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HE HAS TO IMPROVE THE BILL AND LASTLY I WANT TO THANK OF COURSE THE CHAIR IN HIS TEAM- FOR WORKING WITH US IMPROVING THE BILL IN MAKING IT INTO A DRAFT THAT ARE I BELIEVE THAT- VIRTUALLY EVERYONE WOULD FIND APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE. FIND OURSELVES ESPECIALLY IN THE HOUSING CONTEXT. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL ALREADY- SPIN MOBAS JOHN MANAGING YOU THE ROLL. YES THIS IS THE S. B. ONE ONE EIGHT BY SENATOR BOARD YES.

SEARCH A LETTER ITEM NUMBER TWO S. B. ONE THREE TWO THREE. THANKS RICHER AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH TODAY I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL ONE THREE TWO THREE TO REQUIRED LENDERS IN FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS TO HIRE A REALTOR AND SELL THE SECURED PROPERTY FOR AN APPRAISED VALUE ON MULTIPLE MULTIPLE LISTING SERVICE THIS WOULD ALLOW THE DEFAULTED HOMEOWNER TO BE PAID OUT THEIR FULL SAVINGS IN HOME EQUITY IN EVERY APPLICABLES FORECLOSURE. FORECLOSED HOMEOWNERS ARE LOW INCOME OFTEN ELDERLY IMMIGRANT OR DISABLED MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. FOR MEMBERS OF THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HOME IS OFTEN THEIR ONLY ASSET AND HOME EQUITY IS OUR ONLY LIFETIME SAVINGS THE LOSS OF EVEN A SINGLE DOLLAR. OF THIS ACTIVITY IT'S A REPLACEABLE PUTTING THE FOR CLOSE HOMEOWNER AT INCREASED RISK OF POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS A PRIMARY SAVINGS VEHICLE FOR LOW AND MODERATE AND MIDDLE CLASS HOMEOWNERS. IN THE UNITED STATES FOR A FAMILY WITHOUT LIQUID AT BAT FUNDS TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE THERE A CURE TO HOME EQUITY IN THEIR PROPERTY MAY BE THE ONLY SAVINGS THEY HAVE. ADDITIONALLY THE LOSS OF HOME IS ALREADY ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC EVENTS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT THAT A HOUSE DOES GO INTO FORECLOSURE THE HOMEOWNER SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FURTHER BY A LENDER SELLING THE HOUSE. WELL UNDER ITS VALUE THIS LOST EQUITY POTENTIALLY MEANS THAT THE HOMEOWNER WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER HOME AND CAN. LEAVE THEM WITHOUT NOTHING VIRTUALLY NOTHING. AN ESTIMATE OF LOST EQUITY PER FORECLOSURE SALE IN CALIFORNIA IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS REPRESENTED AN AVERAGE OF 22% DISCOUNT OFF THE MARKET PRICE FOR THE AVERAGE HOME SOLD IN FORECLOSURE AUCTIONS. ORDER FOR CLOSE UP CALIFORNIA HOMES HAVE THEIR PROPERTY SOLD AT AUCTION FOR OVER 30% LESS THAN ACTUAL MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY A TENTH ARE SOLD UNDER 52% OF THE MARKET VALUE. WANTED TWENTY FOUR CLOSED- CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS HAVE THEIR PROPERTY SOLD AT AUCTION FOR OVER 70% LESS THAN THE ACTUAL MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY THIS NUMBER REPRESENTS AN AVERAGE OF OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. AGGREGATING THIS DATA APPROXIMATELY SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION IN A GROUP HOME EQUITY WAS TAKEN FROM FOR CLOSE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS OVER THE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD SO ON AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT FIVE BILLION IN THE CURRENT HOME. FORECLOSURE AND THE PROCESS EACH AND EVERY YEAR IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT WHEN A BANK ACQUIRED A FORECLOSED PROPERTY BY A CREDIT BID. THEY WILL THEN HIRE A REALTOR AND SELL THE PROPERTY ON MULTIPLE LISTING SERVICE WHEN THE LENDERS OWN FINANCIAL INTEREST IS AT STAKE IT CONDUCTS THE SALE BY A LISTING NOT BY AUCTION ISN'T THAT IRONIC. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE BECAUSE IT DEMONSTRATES THAT BANKS ARE AWARE THAT AUCTIONS LEAD TO LOWER SALE PRICES AND THE BANKS AND LENDERS ALREADY HAVE THE NECESSARY MECHANISMIN PLACE TO ADOPT. A SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY THREE TO REQUIREMENT OF HIRING A REALTOR AND SELLING THE HOMES IT FOR CLOSURE ON THE LISTING SERVICE IN EQUITY SCENARIOS. AND PUT TO PROTECT THE HOMEOWNER SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD RECAST FORECLOSURE PROVISIONS TO REQUIRE THAT AN EQUITY SALE OF PROPERTY UNDER POWER OF SALE. OF THE MORTGAGE A DEED OF TRUST BE MADE BY A LICENSED REALTOR AND BY PUBLICLY LISTING THE PROPERTY FOR SALE ON THE CALIFORNIA MULTIPLE LISTING SERVICE WITH INITIAL LISTING PRICE AT THE PROPERTY'S APPRAISED VALUE. IF THE HOUSE IS UNDER TO BE SOLD AT AN APPRAISED VALUE THE BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE A TRUST DEED TO PROGRESSIVELY REDUCE THE LISTED PRICE AS TIME GOES ON. OF THE PROPERTY THE TRUSTEE DOES NOT RECEIVE THE QUALIFYING OFFER THERE IS A MECHANISM THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE TRUSTEE TO SELL THE PROPERTY BY PUBLIC AUCTION AS THEY CURRENTLY DO. THE TRUSTEE DOES NOT RECEIVE A QUALIFYING OFFER AFTER THE PRICE REDUCTIONS OR IF THE PRICE DECREASE WILL RESULT IN THE PROPERTIES LISTED PRICE FALLING BEFORE THE EQUITY THRESHOLD. BECAUSE OF THIS LENDERS WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO MADE WHOLE. THE BANK WILL NEVER SUFFER. LENDERS WILL ALWAYS BE WHOLE UNDER THIS BILL I AM AWARE THAT THE OPPOSITION HAD RAISED CONCERNS REGARDING THIS BILL AND HOW IT WOULD IMPACT THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS. TO THAT END I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED DISCUSSION ON SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY THREE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS- TO MAKE THE BILL EVEN STRONGER. AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE IMPORTANT BILL IS CIVIL BALTER A LAWYER AND EXPERT. ON FORECLOSURE FIELD AND HIS CLIENT TO RESET PROBATE WHO HAD HER HOME IN SAN FRANCISCO SOLD AT AUCTION AND ONLY RECEIVED FIFTY DOLLARS AFTER THE TRANSACTION. I RESPECTFULLY AFTER RIVAL.

ALL RIGHT NO ONE ELSE HERE IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED IF WE GO TO THE PHONES PLEASE QUEUE UP THOSE IN SUPPORT OF S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY THREE. IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY. PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEY'RE ALL. IT IN PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEIR APPEARANCE SUPPORT RIGHT AND I HAVE NO ONE AQ AT THE FAX ALL RIGHT- TURNING NOW TO OPPOSITION- WE HAVE. IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE MISTER MIKE BLOAT AND MISTER KEVIN GOULD MIKE BELOW MR BLOOD IS HERE GO AHEAD MR BLOW THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM MIKE BELOW ARE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED TRUSTEES ASSOCIATION ARE FORECLOSURE TRUSTEES WHO HANDLE THESE FORECLOSURES THEY ARE NOT GENERAL TRUSTEES. AS IN A CONSERVATORSHIP WE'RE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE PROBLEM WE DO WITH NO ONE WANTS ANY PERSON TO LOSE EQUITY PARTICULARLY ELDERLY HOMEOWNERS AND WE'VE HAD PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME PRACTICAL AND LEGAL PROBLEMS IN THE BILL IT IS CREATIVE IT IS WELL INTENTIONED BUT I THINK THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN THE BIGGEST ONE. IS THAT THE HOMEOWNER HIM OR HERSELF IS NOT INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS THERE'S AN ACTUAL HOME OWNER OF THE HOUSE BUT THE TRUSTEE IS SUPPOSED TO SELECT AN APPRAISER WHO IS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE HOUSE AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND MAKE AN INFORMED EVALUATION TO ESTABLISH THIS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THEY ARE THEN SUPPOSED TO HIRE A REALTOR AND GO THROUGH OFFERS ON THE HOUSE AGAIN WITH NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE HOMEOWNER SO THAT IS IT THAT RAISES A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF LIABILITY SOMEBODY WILL SAY WE HAVE SELECTED THE WRONG APPRAISER YOU SELECTED THE WRONG REALTOR YOU SELECTED THE WRONG OFFER ON THE HOUSE. BECAUSE THE HOMEOWNERS COMPLETELY ON INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS LEGALLY TRUSTEES HAVE NO ABILITY UNDER THE DEED OF TRUST TO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY SOMEBODY OWNS THE HOUSE AND THEY HAVE A SERIES OF RIGHTS INCLUDING TO REFI. TO SEEK HELP FROM A RELATIVE PERHAPS TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND PUT A STOP TO THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS SO THERE ARE LEGAL PROBLEMS AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS BUT WE DO AGREE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD GET THE MAXIMUM EQUITY OUT OF THEIR HOUSE AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH SENATOR ARCHULETA. TO FIND OF UP THAT A WAY TO GET MEANINGFUL. COMMUNICATION OF THE HOMEOWNER TO SAY LOOK. YOU GOTTA SELL THE HOUSE HERE YOU HAVE THE EQUITY THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE RIGHT ANSWER AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH SENATOR ARCH ALETTA ON THAT. AGAIN CREATIVE WELL INTENTIONED BUT PRACTICALLY AND LEGALLY PROP PROBLEMATIC THANK. THANK YOU OTHERS HERE IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED WAS TESTIFYING OPPOSITION SAYING KNOWN APPROACH TO MICROPHONE- LET'S TURN TO THE PHONES- MISTER. KEVIN GOLD ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL HERE AND SENATORS. MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS COMMINGLED WITH CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE HALF OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR WE ARE ALIGNED WITH THE OVERALL GOAL OF MAXIMIZING THE PROPERTY SALE PRICE AT THE MEANS FOR THEIR EQUITY. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSAL FOR CONCEPTUAL AND MECHANICAL REASONS CONCEPTUALLY WE STRUGGLE WITH THE IDEA OF TAKING A BORROWER MOST OF THE WAY THROUGH THE NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE PROCESS FOR TRYING TO SELL THE PROPERTY ON THE OPEN MARKET. INSTEAD HE PROPOSES THE MEASURE FOCUSED ON ENHANCE NOTICED EARLIER IN THE PROCESS. TO RETURN TO RAISE THE HOMEOWNERS AWARENESS THAT IF THEY HAVE THAT WOULD BE IN THE PROPERTY. BUT THEY MAY WISH TO SELL THE PROPERTY UNDER THEIR TERMS AND THEIR DIRECT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS MEASURE RAISES A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT FLOW FROM THE CLIENT RELATIONSHIP SET FORTH IN THIS PROPOSAL. WHAT TRUSTEE HIRES THE REALTOR. IN THIS SCENARIO THE TRUSTEE IS THE REALTORS CLIENTS NOT THE HOMEOWNER. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. UNDER THIS MATTER THE REAL ESTATE AGENT IS NOT REPRESENTING THE HOMEOWNER RELATIVE TO THE SALE OF THE HOUSE THEY LIVE IN. BUT IT IS INSTEAD OF REPRESENTING THE TRUSTEE. FURTHER RULES TRENDS REQUIRES THE SELLER TO SIGN DOCUMENTS AND MAKE REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE PROPERTY. IF ENACTED IS IT THE TRUSTEE RATHER THAN THE HOMEOWNERS WITH CHINESE DOCUMENTS AND MAKE THESE REPRESENTATIONS. WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER TH NOTION OF A REALTOR REPRESENTING A TRUSTEE. IN THE OPEN MARKET SALE OF A HOME THAT THE HOMEOWNER STILL POSSESSES. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED. BETTER APPROACHES TO PRO ACTIVELY INTERVENE EARLIER IN THE PROCESS. THAT MEANS TO BETTER INFORM THE HOMEOWNER OF. PEOPLE PLAN TO DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT ACCOMPLISHES THIS GOAL AND HOPE THIS WILL YIELD PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS. FRIEDMAN STATED WE ARE CLOSED TODAY BUT ARE HOPEFUL THAT OUR DISCUSSIONS WILL LEAD US IN THE FUTURE COMPROMISED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GOLD ALL RIGHT- OTHERS HERE IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED ANYONE ELSE HERE IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED SAYING KNOWN APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE LET'S TURN THE PHONE LINES MATTER IF YOU WOULD. QUEUE UP THOSE ON THE PHONE LINES IN OPPOSITION. TO THIRTEEN TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU AND IF YOU'RE AN APPLE. OF THEY'RE TWENTY THREE FOR PRESS AND SAY. AND AT THIS TIME WE HAVE TO IN Q. AND A- FIRST LINE IS ONE OH NINE PLEASE HEY. THIS BILL DOWN THIS AFTERNOON THIS IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU AND ONE MOMENT THE NEXT PERSON AT LINE EIGHTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. AFTERNOON CARE MEMBERS ROBERT WILSON THE CALIFORNIA BRADY LEAGUE HERE OPPOSITIONAL AS THE THIRTEEN TWENTY THREE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTY LET'S BRING IT BACK I'M SORRY GO AHEAD MODERATE OR ANYONE ELSE. I'M SORRY WE DO HAVE ONE WITH AN APPARATUS TO BE JUST A MOMENT ALL RIGHT. AND THAT IS NINE ONE SIXTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS ANTHONY HELTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK HERE TO THE CHAMBER QUESTIONS COME CENTER MICHALSKI YEAH I GOT PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL HOW TO SAVE LIKE THAT AND I KNOW ALL MY FRIENDS ARE THERE ON SUPPORT MEMMOTT BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEY. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM FORECLOSURE BY FILING A CHAPTER THIRTEEN BANKRUPTCY I WANT EVERYBODY TO HEAR THAT YOU SAVE YOUR HOME FROM FOR CLOSURE BY FILING A CHAPTER THIRTEEN BANKRUPTCY THEN YOU HAVE THEN THAT ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE OPPOSITION IS TALKING ABOUT THE- PERSON STILL OWNS THE HOME. THEY'RE STILL IN THEIR HOUSE AND THEY COME UP WITH A PLAN TO EITHER PAY BACK THE ARREARS THAT THEY OWN BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL DOOM OR THE COURTS TYPICALLY WILL GIVE YOU A YEAR TO SALAD SO BAD NEWS IS GOT TO GET OUT THAT YOU CAN FILE THE DAY BEFORE THE FORECLOSURE SALE. BECAUSE THESE TRUSTEES OF ARE ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THE LAW SAYS THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO MAXIMIZE THE SALE THAT'S THE MISNOMER BY ADVOCATES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO SELL THE HOUSE. THAT'S IT THEY OWN THEY REPRESENT THE BANK THEY DON'T HAVE ANY WIGGLE ROOM ALL WE GET TO DO IS SAY HERE'S A BID FOR WHAT WE'RE OWED ON OUR LOAN. AND THERE'S OVER BIDDING IN CRAZY TIMESBUT THERE'S NOT THAT MANY CRAZY TIMES BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THE WAY YOU HAVE IT STRUCTURED RATHER THAN. ADDING CHANGING THE NOTICE OF TRUSTEE SALE IN DEALING WITH THAT AFTER THE DEFAULT PERIOD HIS AND AFTER THE NINETY DAYS. THEY HAVE TWENTY ONE DAYS TO NOTICES SALE. THERE PROP ALL THE DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU HAVE SEEM TO ME THAT THAT WOULD BE THE TIME THAT YOU WOULD GIVE PEOPLE NOTICE. THAT THEY THAT THEY WOULD THAT THEY WOULD SELL BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE THE INNOCENT HOMEOWNER THAT'S THERE SO THEY CAN SIGN DOCUMENTS. BUT THESE ARE REAL PROBLEMS ABOUT. HAVING SOMEBODY YOU CALL A TRUSTEE'S SEAT SALE ONLY DO SAY ANYBODY OVER BIT THAT'S IT DATE AND THEN THEY RECORD. THE TRANSFER DOCUMENTS SO- NOBODY LIKES A FORFEITURE SO WE GET THAT AND I GET THAT I KNOW WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM BUT BUT THE WAY IT'S SET UP IT'S A REAL BIG PROBLEM AFTER THE FORECLOSURE SALES BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIMBO YOUR AVAILABLE IN THE AND THESE ARE REAL PROBLEMS THAT YES YOU COULD I MEAN I'M DOING A FOR CLOSURE IN THE CIVIL ACTION IS AN UNBELIEVABLE TASKIN. WHO DOES TRYING TO TRYING TO DO THAT BUT BUT NOBODY'S BREAKING THE LAW HERE THAT'S WHAT THE LAW IS AND THAT WAS THE DEAL A NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURES SO. I'M I GUESS I'M VENTING ASSEMBLY I'M VENTING GUIDE BUT I. WANT TO CUT BANKRUPTCY LAWYER TWO MINUTES UP THE PHILLIES. AT AFTER THE DEFAULT PERIOD BECAUSE THEN YOU STILL HAVE TWENTY ONE DAYS TO SELL IT THERE'S SOME WAYS THAT YOU CAN GET SOME PRETTY. PROTECTIONS THERE BECAUSE THAT THE WHOLE. LOAN IS. IS SUPPOSED TO ANYWAY BUT- THIS AFTER THE SALE OR FOUR OR BURKE SENDING IT I DON'T I'M AFRAID AT THAT BECAUSE THESE ARE. WELL I DON'T KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR WHITE HOUSE GATHER COMMENTS- LET'S SEE SENATOR HERTZBERG. YEAH YEAH I ALSO HAVE. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S TWO KINDS OF WAYS TO FOR CLOSE ONES CALL THE POWER OF SALE. UNDER FIVE AB IN THE OTHER ONE IS A JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE UNDER JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE HAVE A RIGHT OF REDEMPTION. SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET THE HOUSE BACK FOR A YEAR YOU HAVE A RIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN TRANSFERRED RIGHT TO THAT DOES EXIST IN A LOT NUMBER ONE. THE OTHER ISSUE IS. WE'RE TRYING TO FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE WAY- CENTER A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES ONE OF THE WILL IS WE WANT TO PRESERVE PEOPLE'S EQUITY AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE TREATED FAIRLY. ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE THIS MASSIVE CONSUMER 8% WE'VE GOT THIS MASSIVE CONSUMER PROTECTION WHERE WHEN YOU BUY HOUSES YOU KNOW AS A RULER. YOU HAVE HOME INSPECTIONS YOU HAVE LIABILITY FOR THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE YOUR- DEALS WITH THE WTH THE SMOKE DETECTORS AND THE AND THE BUT WHAT SHOULD WE CALL IT THE- THE DEALS FOR THE SMALL DEALS OR WHATEVER THE- STUFF. THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO THERE AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS AS YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S EQUITY. IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO SELL IT YOU HAVE TO THEN PROTECT THE CONSUMER WHO'S BUYING THE HOUSE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ISSUE OF TITLE INSURANCE AND HOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORKS SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THIS DYNAMIC. IS YES YOU'RE INTRODUCING A CONSUMER INTO A PROCESS IT'S A HOST CELL PROCESS THESE PEOPLE THAT BY COMING WITH TWENTY OR THIRTY COOK CASHIERS CHECKS THEY BUY FOR CASH THE PULLING TOGETHER WHAT THEY NEED IF THERE'S AN OVER BID. AND THEN THEY TAKE THE RISK RIGHT AND THEN THEY SELL IT AND PROVIDE THE PROTECTIONS TO THE NEXT WHETHER IT'S THEIR BANK THAT DOESN'T QUITE OFTEN IN MANY CASES THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF FOLKS THAT RUN AROUND YOU PROBABLY HAVE SEEN I HAVE. IN PRIVATE LIFE WITH THE RUN AROUND THEY JUST GO FROM AUCTION TO AUCTION TO BUY STUFF BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT A REPORT TO RIP YOU OFF AND BY YOUR HOUSE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS WOULD A HER THOUSAND DOLLARS MAKE A PROFIT RIGHT. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TITLE INSURANCE THEY HAVE NO CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THEN THEY PUT IN THE MARKET WITH A REALTOR TO DO THAT. HURTING THE CONSUMER WHO WHO'S BEEN TAKING WHETHER EQUITY SO I'M SUGGESTING IS YOU. THINK THIS THING THROUGH MAY BE. THERE'S PROVISION OF WAY YOU CAN- THE- TO. TRAVEL HOME. SO THAT ANYBODY WHO BUYS IT WOULD HAVE NOTICE OF WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE IF THERE'S TERMITES OR- WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THE KINDS OF THINGS TO GET THROUGH HOME INSPECTION. TO SOMEONE BUYS THIS. THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF CONSUMER PROTECTION I'M A SUPPORT THIS TODAY. FOR SERIES OF REASONS BUT I DO THINK. I APOLOGIZE YOU JUST TALKED TO BEFORE THIS- AND THE SPRING THIS ON YOU. BUT I DO THINK IS WE THINK THROUGH. THIS DIAGNOSTIC ABOUT WHAT THE CURRENT LAW IS HOW IT'S UNFAIR. TO TWO PEOPLE AND WE SEE. WE SEE THESE HORRIBLE STORIES. BUT CAO THEN YOU PROTECT THE CONSUMER ON THE FLIP SIDE. WITH THE JUST MARRIED OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW AS A REALTOR. THAT YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT AND ALL THE REPRESENTATION JEFF TO MAKE AND THE LIKE. AND SO NOW YOU'VE GOT. A BUYER WHO'S GOING TO PAY. THAT EXTRA MONEY BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE REST OF COASTAL JUST THINK ABOUT IT I'LL HELP YOU AND GIVE YOU SOME PART OF IT I JUST WANT TO ISSUE SPOT THAT FOR YOU. OKAY AND MIXTURE IF I MAY- AMENDMENTS ARE FORTHCOMING NO DOUBT. IN FURTHER MEETINGS ARE FORTHCOMING. AND I'VE SAID THAT TO THE OPPOSITION THEY'VE AGREED- THERE'S NO DOUBT WE'RE GOING TO MEET MORE TO. CLEAN THINGS UP BUT- IF I CAN HAVE OF THE ATTORNEY COME UP IN ADDRESS- WHAT- CENTER WOULD COST YOU HAD TO SAY. AND THE CENTER I'M I'LL TELL YOU THAT. GRANTED THERE'S THINGS AT THE OTHER END. BUT WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED. LIKE TO WITNESS TODAY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THOSE THINGS AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT- THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP THERE'S NO DOUBT IN THIS IS OUR FIRST STEP- IN THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS BILL. BUT IF THE ATTORNEY WOULD LIKE TO. ADDRESS THE THAT MR MAKOWSKI THE BILL'S SLIGHTLY RESUME I'M STRIDES OKAY THE REST OF OSTLER GO AHEAD- YEAH THE FIRST TO THE BANKRUPTCY ISSUE ON. THE WEATHER THIS PROPERTY IS LAW STOOD ON THE MLS. OR CONDUCT BY OCT. AT THE COURTHOUSE- IT WILL BE IF. THE CONSUMERS ABILITY TO FILE BANKRUPTCY IN STATE THE ACTION. OUT THERE STILL BE ABLE TO FILE BANKRUPTCY AND STATE THE ACTION. AT THE SAME WAY ONE OR THE OTHER THIS DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT THAT- AND- WHETHER THE TRUSTEE IS- THE REALTORS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE TRUSTEE. FOR THE HOMEOWNER. CURRENTLY UNDER LAW YOU KNOW THE POWER OF SALE CONFERRED ON THE LENDER- THROUGH THE MORTGAGE TO. CONDUCT THE SALE SO. WHEN THEY TAKE THE PROPERTY TO AUCTION RIGHT THE AUCTIONEER IS NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE HOMEOWNER. THEY'RE ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE BANK AND SO IT WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SITUATION RIGHT THIS IS A DIFFERENT FORM. OF TRUSTEE'S SALE TRUSTEE SALE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER- AND CENTER IF YOU CAN- ART. CAN I MR YES GO AHEAD OF ME LOU COMMISSION HERE IS THAT. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WHERE THERE'S NO CONSUMER PROTECTION SO LET'S ASSUME THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY WHO'S A BUYER. THE HOUSES HAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR MORTGAGE ON IT IT'S WORTH FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. THE HOMEOWNER HAS FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT COULD BE. YOU KNOW LYING ARGUMENT IS WELL BY PUTTING IT ON THAT LISTING SERVICE. THE ODDS ARE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JUST GET ONE OF THAT WHICH WE CALL ON THE BUSINESS THE FORTY THIEVES. ARE GOING TO COME AND TAKE IT AND BUY IT JUST FOR THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE A PAYOFF THAT THE BLENDER. WITH A SO THEY CAN MAKE THE PROFIT AND SO NOW YOU'VE CREATED SOME COMPETITION IN THE MARKETPLACE. WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW INCLUDING COMPETITION IF YOU BRING THE CONSUMER. THAT'S RIGHT PROPRIA. BUT WHEN YOU BRING THE CONSUMER AND- THERE'S NOW A SERIES OF APPROPRIATE AND BE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS IN THE LAW. ON YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE NOW GONNA LISTED BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE INSPECTION. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW ALL THE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE REALTOR HAS. THE AMOUNT OF HOMEWORK TO THE REALTOR HAS TO DO IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. AND YOU'VE SEEN THE LAST HOW BIG THOSE. FILES GET COMPARED WITH THE USED TO BE THIRTY YEARS GO. CONSUMER CONSERVE. YOU'VE CHIU UP OUR NOT TO. THAT NOT YOU SHOULD BE DOING I'M JUST. IT NEEDS MORE. IN THAT REGARD I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN- WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE RESPONSE AND THE WAY THAT THIS CONCERN IS ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL. IS THAT THE BUYER IS ABLE TO SUBMIT. OFFERS FOR THE PROPERTY WITH CONTINGENCIES WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE WHOLE THING AND SO IF THE CONTINGENCIES AREN'T LIFTED LIFTED IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO INSPECT THE PROPERTY IF THE PROPERTY IS NOT A CONDITION. IF THE HOMEOWNER WON'T COOPERATE WITH THE SALE. THEN THE CONTINGENCY WON'T BE LISTED IN THE SALE WON'T GO THROUGH. I'M IN THAT WAY THE CONSUMER WILL BE PROTECTED THROUGH THE SALES PROCESS. UNLIKE THE AUCTION SYSTEM NOW. RIGHT BECAUSE THESE THESE BIDDERS TO GO TO THE AUCTION. AND THEY DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK INSIDE THE PROPERTY THEY DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE. THEY DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OFFERS WITH CONTINGENCIES. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF BIG DIDN'T RISK THERE THAT DRIVES DOWN THE AUCTION PRICE. OR THE PRICE MIGHT BE HIGHER IF THERE'S AN MLS OFFER WITH A CONTINGENCY ADDED AT LEAST IN THEORY. BUT CAGES MISTER ONE OF THEM. NUMBER ONE YEAH BUT YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE LITIGATION. LEFT AND RIGHT THERE IS AN INSPECTION DATA ON THESE THINGS I'VE SEEN IT I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. AND BUT THE INSPECTION IS FROM SOPHISTICATED PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING TO BOTTOM FISH RIGHT. NOW YOU CAN ALL OF A SUDDEN INTERJECTED CONSUMERS AND THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED. NO BID UP THOUGH TAKES A HOUSES THEY SEE ON THE MARKET WITH FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND. FIRST TRUST DEED AND THEY'LL BUY IT FOR FOUR THOUSAND BUT THEN WITH THAT COMES ON APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SO YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE EQUITY IN THE HOUSE NO QUESTION. I JUST I'M JUST TELLING YOU YOUR CAR IS A LITTLE BIT MORE HOMEWORK TO FIGURE OUT THAT BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO FOR HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. THE SHERIFF I MAKE. UP I'D LIKE TO BRING THAT DISCUSSION BACK. TO THE PEOPLE THAT. WE JUST HEARD WITNESSED- TO THOSE WHO BEEN SUFFERED- THE LADY FROM SAN FRANCISCO HER STORY. THIS IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE INVESTORS. WHO WRITE THOSE. MULTITUDE OF CHECKS SHOULDN'T AND SO ON. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY KNOW WHAT THE GAMBLE IS- AND THAT'S TO DO DIFFERENT SEPARATE ISSUE. IT IN AND I WANTED AYE AYE. AND OF COURSE WHEN THEY DO SELL THE PROPERTY THEY THEY FIX IT AND SELL IT FOR A PROFIT. THEY'LL HAVE SOME DISCLOSURES THAT THE BUYER WILL RECEIVE. SO AT THE OTHER END THE BUYER WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF THAT PARTICULAR BUYER. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS SAID- THAT THAT YOU'RE A HOMEOWNER. WHO COME FROM NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE ARE TOUGH THE BLUE COLLAR DAY SAVED ALL THEIR LIVES. THERE ARE THEY'VE LOST THEIR HOMES AND THEY WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING. THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL ABOUT. AND THIS. IS WHERE I MATCHING FOR THE AYE VOTE. ALL RIGHTY- OTHER QUESTIONS CONSIDERABLY. I'M GONNA SAY SINCE IT'S ALL RIGHT CABALLERO DID YOU OBVIOUS I COULD JUST GOT CHOKED UP JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF SELF ALL RIGHT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO THANK- THE- THE WOMAN FOR HER TESTIMONY HERE TODAY I'M SORRY I FORGOT HER NAME BUT- IT WAS VERY COMPELLING- I. UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES RELATED TO HOW COMPLICATED IT IS TO CHANGE A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THAT IS SET UP TO DISPOSE OF PROPERTY VERY QUICKLY I THINK THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF. OF HER TESTIMONY IS THAT IT WAS IT WAS UNFAIR AND FUNDAMENTALLY TO BE PAYING FOR YOUR HOUSE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THEN TO GET IT- STOLEN FROM FOR IT FROM YOU AND SOLD IN THE SEVENTH. THE PRICE OF WHAT IT'S WORTH IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS AND IN THE STATE AND SO- I REALLY AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE'S AN INTEREST IN SITTING DOWN AND FIGURING OUT WHAT THE SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE- I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE YOU'RE THERE YET BUT I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BECAUSE WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO STOP THIS IT. AND THERE THERE ARE THERE ARE WAYS TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE BUT IF YOU THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM THEN IT DOESN'T DO THEM ANY GOOD AND WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THIS HAPPEN SO. I'LL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE IN ORDER FOR IT FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT ON THE FLOOR BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE- AND- AND SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS. BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE NO DOUBT THANK YOU CYNICAL YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SAYING NONE. WHAT SHE SAID SENATOR LAYERED SAID. ALL RIGHT HERTZBERG MOVES THE BILL ALL RIGHT. SURGERY CARE CLOSEYES THANK YOU MISS SHARED I THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH ME AND- YOUR COMMITTEE AND OF COURSE I'LL BE WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU BECAUSE I THINK WE DISCOVERED THERE DEFINITELY IS AN ISSUE HERE THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS IN SOMETIME OR ANOTHER MAY BE FACED WITH THIS. AND IT IS OUR TIME TO ADDRESS IT- WHETHER IT- IT'S FUNDAMENTAL WHETHER IT'S SAID CHANGING SOMETHING I WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION DO WHAT WE CAN SO WHEN WE DID THE SENATE FLOOR WE CAN ALL SUPPORT IT. AND TAKE CARE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THOSE. WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO TO A VOTE- SEARCH THAT APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THIS IS A CHALLENGING QUESTION A CHALLENGING ISSUE NO DOUBT THERE'S BEEN. SOME THAT AVE BEEN HARMED YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE RESOLVE IT AND WHO RESOLVES AND WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO RESOLVE- IN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES TO WORK OUT. I THINK THAT SEVERAL OF US AND ALL INCLUDE MYSELF IN THAT GROUP ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE BEFORE IT HITS THE FLOOR BECAUSE THERE'S SOME. I THINK SOME REAL PROCEDURAL CHALLENGES STILL REMAIN SO HAVING SAID THAT MANAGE TO COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL. YES THIS IS THAT SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY THREE BY SENATOR ARE TO LET THAT WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR HERTZBERG THE MOTION IS TO PASS. ON BURKE I. AM BURKE AYE BURGESS WRESTLE I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HERTZBERG. HERTZBERG BY JONES JONES NO LAYERED LAYERED I STERN. WHAT KASKY.

THIS IS A ANOTHER BILL IN MY APRIL PACKAGE AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEARING THIS TODAY. SB TEN THIRTY FIVE WILL ENCOURAGE MEDICATION COMPLIANCE BY THOSE RECEIVING TREATMENT THROUGH AN S. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN SOMETIMES AS LAURA'S LAW IF MEDIC CATION IS PRESCRIBED AS PART OF THAT TREATMENT PLAN. THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE COURTS TO CONDUCT STATUS HEARINGS. WITH AN INDIVIDUAL AND THE TREATMENT TEAM TO RECEIVE UPDATED INFORMATION HOW IS THAT PATIENT DOING HOW WAS THE COMPLAINTS GOING ON A PART OF THE REGULAR FILING OF AFFIDAVITS TO THE COURT ESTABLISHING. AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY TO THE OUTSET THAT. BUT TREATMENT PROGRAM- IS THAT IN THE END IT IS TO BE ABLE TO ADHERE TO THAT TREATMENT PLAN. DISSLY TO MEDICATION. COMPLIANCE THIS IS THE BEST PRACTICES IDENTIFIED BY EXPERIENCED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE A. O. T. JUDGES. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORTING ON A. O. T. A PLANTATION THEY NOTE THAT. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO ENCOURAGE AND ENSURE TREATMENT PLANTS COMPLAINTS MAY INCLUDE. BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO INCREASE NUMBER OF UPDATED HEARINGS MEDICATION OUT REACH AND ENGAGEMENT TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AND OR ASSESSMENT. HENSCHEL HOSPITALS. WE KNOW THAT MEDICATIONS BEING PRESCRIBED WE KNOW IT'S PART PEOPLE STRIPPING PLANTER HAS BEEN SUB HESITANCY FOR US TO SAY IT'S PART OF THE PLAN- BUT WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA SAY IS IT IS CAN BE PART OF THE PLAN WE KNOW WHAT'S DONE IN OTHER STATES. BUT WE'RE NOT SAYING THIS WILL BE FORCED MEDICATION FOR ANYBODY BUT JUST THEM COMING BEFORE TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR COMPLIANCE OR LACK THERE OF COMPLIANCE IN OF COURSE ASSEMBLY WITH CONTINUED NON COMPLIANCE CAN THEN BE REFERRED TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. THIS IS NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT JUST- CONTINUES TO MONITOR I HAVE MORE FREQUENT UPDATES POSSIBLY- AND REALLY BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH FOLKS AROUND THEIR COMPLIANCE. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TODAY THE HONORABLE THOMAS M. ANDERSON- THE JUDGE IN NEVADA COUNTY WERE OF THIS LAW WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA- DUE TO OUR TIMING IS NOW NO NOT ABLE TO ATTEND.

MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM HERE. GO AHEAD. RICHARD SHERMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF- JUDGE ANDERSON I JUST WANT TO DELIVER A FEW REMARKS BASED ON NOTES HE MADE I'LL BE VERY BRIEF- HE SAID THAT SINCE I ISSUE THE FIRST ORDER ON AN A. O. T. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT THE PATIENT RECORDS AS ORDERED COMPLIANCE- WITH THE TREATMENT PLANS INCLUDED THE ORDER TAKE MEDICATIONS AS PRESCRIBED AS WELL AS THE ORDER MAY CALL WITNESS WITH YOUR THERAPIST DR THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP. IN THAT DIRECTION I HOLD STATUS CONFERENCES GETTING THE PARTICIPANT AND THE TREATMENT TEAM IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE EVERY TWO WEEKS OR MORE OFTEN IF NEEDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PARTICIPANTS I STRONGLY FEEL THAT THE COURT'S ROLE OF SUPERVISION IN THIS MANNER CREATES A BOND OF TRUST WITH PARTICIPANTS AND INSURERS- IS SUCCESS IN THE PROGRAM HAVING A PARTICIPANT STAND IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES NOT JUST SUPERVISION. OF BOTH THE PARTICIPANT IN THE TREATMENT PROVIDER BUT IT ALSO REASSURES THAT A PARTICIPANT AT THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE THEM AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS OR NEEDS- HAVING THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE- IN THIS BILL- SB TEN THIRTY FIVE TO THE STATUE WILL HELP JUDGES FOCUS ON THE WHOLE TREATMENT APPROACH AND THE NEED TO STAY AWARE OF THE PARTICIPANTS PROGRESS AND ENCOURAGE.

MEDICATION CANNOT BE ORDERED IN THE ORIGINAL TREATMENT PLAN I WANNA SUBDIVISION FIFTY THREE FORTY EIGHT CITIES COMPLIED WITH. DATES THERE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SO WE GO STANDARD TO THE COURT CAN ORDER TREATMENT FOR THE COURT ORDER MEDICATION THERE IS A WHOLE NEW PROVISION. THAT HAS TO BE COMPLIED WITH.

WHITE HOUSE SKI WINNER WINNER I HAVE NINETY ZERO SO FAR WITH THE MEMBER MISSING HE WILL BE BACK. THANK YOU PUT THAT ON CALL- NEXT- SENATOR THE ROSSO'S GOING TO PRESENT. THE THERE ALSO WILL WILL SB BUT ITEM FOUR YOU SURE TO SPEAK AN EIGHTY- AUTHOR THE RICH AUTHOR CENTER COM LONGER. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE. ON BEHALF OF SENATOR COM LONGER- I WANT TO BEGIN BY AFFIRMATIVELY STATING THAT SENATOR COM LONGER HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY THIS COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT AS WE TEN EIGHTY FIVE SIX TO PROTECTING KEEP MORE FAMILIES TOGETHER BY REDEFINING QUOTE UNQUOTE NEGLECT INDEPENDENCY COURTS WHEN DETERMINING CHILD NEGLECT IN JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURT HEARINGS. THE CURRENT OVERLY BROAD DEFINITION CAN PUT FAMILIES AT RISK THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL PROTECTION FOR FAMILIES VULNERABLE TO SEPARATION BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS POVERTY HOMELESSNESS AND THE LACK OF ACCESS TO CERTAIN RESOURCES. IN CASES OF ALLEGED NEGLECT COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS INITIATE PETITIONS THROUGH THE COURT THE COURT THEN RELIES ON THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF SOCIAL WORKERS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER LEGAL ACT OF A CHILD IS TAKING PLACE THE CURRENT BROAD DEFINITION OF NEGLECT ALLOWS REMOVAL TO BE INITIATED FOR RELATIVELY MINOR SOMETIMES TEMPORARY CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO POVERTY. THE DEFINITION IN THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SHOULD BE REFINED. SO THAT CONDITIONS SUCH AS A PARTIALLY EMPTY REFRIGERATOR DAMAGE FURNITURE OR TEMPORARY INABILITY TO AFFORD CHILDCARE WHILE WORKING A LOW WAGE JOB WILL NOT. ALONE RESULT IN THE REMOVAL OF A CHILD FROM THEIR PARENTS POVERTY AND THE LACK OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES ESPECIALLY FOR HISTORICALLY MORE MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS SHOULD NOT BE FURTHER ADJUDICATED BY OUR COURT. SEPARATING FAMILIES FOR UNREASONABLE AND ARBITRARY REASON. CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS ALREADY EXIST FOR ONE LACK OF EMERGENCY SHELTER TO THE FAILURE PARENTS TO SEEK COURT. ORDERS FOR CUSTODY OF THE CHILD AND EVEN THREE I MEDICAL TREATMENT BASED ON RELIGIOUS OR SPIRITUAL CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC EXCEPTIONS SHOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED IT CONSIDER CONDITIONS OF POVERTY AND A LACK OF RESOURCES AS A PRESENT REALITY FOR MANY PARENTS. THE STATUTES IN PLACE AND CREATED THE RELEVANT SECTIONS OF THE WELL FRIENDS AND INSTITUTIONS SECTION THREE HUNDRED. OUTLINING THE DEFINITION OF NEGLECT WERE CAPTURED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN MINOR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE. HOWEVER NONE HAVE ADDRESSED THE OVER ARCHING DEFINITION OF NEGLECT. SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE WILL ADDRESS THIS LONG STANDING ISSUE BY BOTH PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND ALLOWING SOCIAL WORKERS TO MAKE MORE INFORMED REPORTING OF NEGLECT WITH ME HERE. IN SUPPORT IS AND EAT MOZINGO AN ATTORNEY AND AN ORRICK RIESEL RACIAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE FELLOW. AS WELL AS STEPHANIE JEFFCOAT A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER AND IMPACTED MOTHER BOTH WITH A NEW WAY OF LIFE REENTRY PROJECT THE SPONSOR ORGANIZATION OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO IF EITHER OF YOU ON THE PHONE PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELVES. BUT IT'S PRESIDENT ALL RIGHT AND WITH MISMAS MOZINGO PLEASE PROCEED. IN ORDER TO ROUTE THOUGH GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBER I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION ATTORNEY IN ORACLE JUST CALLING WITH A NEW WAY OF LIFE BANTRY PROJECT AN LA BASED NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDES HOUSING AND SUPPORT THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMEN LOOKING FOR COMMUNITY REENTRY AN INDIVIDUAL HEALING WE PROVIDE HOLISTIC FAMILY REUNIFICATION SERVICES INCLUDING SUPPORT PERSON ADVOCACY AND CHILD WELFARE INVESTIGATION INTO THE NOT DEPENDENCY COURT PROCEEDINGS. IN OUR PRACTICE WE OBSERVE THAT IN ALL STAGES OF DEPENDENCY CASES. POVERTY IMPACT OUTCOMES. I WANT TO GET OUT AND DIFFERENT WAYS LIKE WHEN CONDITIONS OF. ARE AT THE IN TWO WORKER. TO SUBSTANTIATE HELD EACH RECORD. INCLUDING RETAIN ITS FROM THEIR WORKER REFERENCING. FAMILY HOMES BEING AND- CONDITIONS A FAMILY LIVING IN A SHELTER OR A SOBER LIVING PROGRAM WE'RE NOT HAVING A STABLE LIVING ARRANGEMENTS. MOTHER RELYING ON AN OLDER SIBLING FOR BABYSITTING. A MOTHER NOT DRAFTING A CHILD INTO WHETHER APPROPRIATE CLEAN CLOTHES. TE MOTHER CONTRARY AND. ABILITY TO AFFORD DENTISTRY. OUR HOME BEING STOCK WORKS OF TO BE FAIR WITH MINIMAL. A HOME NOT HAVING TO FOR AND APPLIANCES NOT BEING IN WORKING CONDITION. WHILE OUR PRACTICE ALSO HAVE USURPED MANY COMMUNITY ORGS INCLUDING OUR BOARDING PASSES OCT BASE TO LIFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY AND KEEP THEM TOGETHE. PARTICULARLY FAMILIES AT RISK OF CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT. THIS IS BECAUSE THE HELPING SEPARATED FROM OUR PRIMARY CARE GIVER HAS PROFOUND LASTING IMPACT ON THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH. EVEN MORE RACIAL JUSTIE THE FIRE SUPPORTING RATHER THAN SEPARATING STRUGGLING FAMILIES. IT OVERBROAD DEFINITION OF NEGLECT THE FAMILIES VULNERABLE TO IMPLICIT BIAS. IN TWENTY TWENTY AND L. A. COUNTY THREE QUARTERS OF CHILDREN REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES WORK FLAG NEXT TO BLACK. BLACK CHILDREN WERE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE CHILDREN TO BE THE SUBJECT OF A CHILD WELFARE CASE. REDEFINING NEGLECT WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF ARBITRARY DECISIONMAKING PERPETUATING SYSTEM SYSTEMIC BIAS. YEAH WE'RE SUPPORT FOR SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO HEAL AND NOT AN ADMIRABLE FAMILY IN HERE THEY GIVE US MOZINGO. OF. MISCHIEF CODE ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES I AM GO AHEAD. BUT AFTER CHERRY MEMBERS NAME FACT JEFFCO AND I'M A COMMUNITY HERE ANYWAY OF LIFE I'M IN SUPPORT OF TWO EIGHTY FIVE BECAUSE POVERTY IS NOT NEGLECT FOR OVER NINETEEN YEARS I STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION AND CYCLE IN AND OUT OF INCARCERATION I FOUND MYSELF HOMELESS HAVE LOCKED MY CHILDREN AND WAS THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT WHICH RESULTED IN PREGNANCY. AT THE TIME I WAS HOMELESS AND SLEEPING IN MY CAR WHEN I GAVE BIRTH TO MY DAUGHTER SHE WAS DETAINED BY CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES OF ORANGE COUNTY FOR EXPOSURE IN THE WOMB MY DAUGHTER WAS TAKEN RIGHT FROM MY ARMS AT THE TIME SHE WAS NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF MALNOURISHMENT OR ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCY. SHE HAD BEEN BORN AND HAVE NOT BEEN PHYSICALLY ABUSED NOR DID HE SHOW ANY FIND ANY EMOTIONAL DAMAGE THE ALLEGATION. TOWARDS ME REPEAT YOUR TO PROTECT. I NEVER EVEN GIVEN THE CHANCE TO PROVIDE HER WITH ADEQUATE FOOD CLOTHING OR SHELTER. THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO. CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY HOMELESSNESS AND INCARCERATION IN A RACIALLY BIASED MANNER. YOU THE MY STRUGGLES AT THE CONVENIENCE. IT WAS CONVENIENT BECAUSE LESS WORK IF REQUIRED OF A SOCIAL WORKER WHEN A MOTHER'S WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN. OFTENTIMES TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS IN ADOPTION HEARINGS ARE BASICALLY UNCONTESTED IN A MOTHER AT IN. MY CIRCUMSTANCES MADE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO ACHIEVE ANOTHER ADOPTION TO BOLSTER THEIR STATISTICS. FOR THEM IT WAS THE CONVENIENCE BUT FOR ME IT HAD ROBBIA MY DIGNITY YOU PROCESS AND MY CIVIL RIGHT TO PARENTHOOD. SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE WILL HELP BONTA BOTH FAMILIES ARE AT RISK OF BEING SEPARATED BY ALLOWING SOCIAL WORKERS. TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ARMY PARTY NEGLECT. IT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES PRIMARILY FAMILY THE COLOR. COULD NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SUBJECT OF THESE HARMFUL PETITIONS. I DO THIS WORK THAT OTHER MOTHERS OR MOTHERS LIKE ME. ARE GIVEN A CHANCE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. BY IS THAT I AM ABLE TO PROVIDED RESOURCE. AND SERVICES TODAY TO. INSTEAD OF BEING TORN APART.CONDITIONS OF POVERTY SHOULD NOT ALONE BE THE REASON TO PERMANENTLY SEPARATE A PARENT FROM THEIR CHILD. IT'S TIME FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE LEGISLATION THAT FOCUS MORE ON REUNIFICATION AND NOT SEPARATION. THIRTY THREE THIS TODAY I AM RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING YOUR I. ABOUT.

FOR THURSDAY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE WHICH REQUIRES A TIME LIMITED DEMAND SETTLEMENT IN A PERSONALLY PERSONAL INJURY CLAIM TO REMAIN OPEN FOR TWENTY ONE BUSINESS DAYS TO ALLOW INSURERS ADEQUATE TIME TO RESPOND TO THE DEMAND- AND IF I COULD HEAR MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE- DID AS WELL AS THE DISCUSSIONS I HAD WITH WITH YOU AS THE CHAIR AND I'M ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE- IN THE- IN THE IN THE NELSON ANALYSIS YES THANK YOU CYNICAL HERE EIGHT I'M- AND IS A SETTLEMENT OFFER MADE BY A CLAIMANT. TO THE INSURER OF A DEFENDANT. THIS IMPLIES A SETTLEMENT OFFER OFTEN COMES WITH THE TIME LIMIT AND THE TIME LIMITS HAVE BECOME SHORTER AND SHORTER SOMETIMES AS LITTLE AS FIVE DAYS WHICH MAKES IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR INSURERS TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE A CLAIM WHEN USED CORRECTLY TIME LIMITED DEMANDS FACILITATE A QUICKER SETTLEMENT REDUCE LITIGATION COSTS AND ALLOW INSURERS TO CLOSE A CLAIM BENEFITING THE CLAIMANT THE INSURER AND THE COURTS HOWEVER THE CLEAR CURRENT PROCESS IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ABUSE BECAUSE IF THE INSURER DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE OFFER WITHIN THE TIME LIMITS AND ARE GIVEN. IN THE OFFER IS CONSIDERED REJECTED AND PUNITIVE PENALTIES MAY ACCRUE GIVEN THE COMPLEX INFORMATION NEEDED TO CONCLUDE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT INSURANCE COMPANIES NEED AN APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME TO INVESTIGATE INVESTIGATE A CLAIM BY GATHER RELEVANT DATA AND DOCUMENTS UNFORTUNATELY IT IS BECOME A LITIGATION TACTIC TO PRESSURE SETTLEMENT WITHOUT ALLOWING SUFFICIENT TIME TO FULLY INVESTIGATE THE CLAIM AND TO SET UP THE INSURER FOR A BAD FAITH LAWSUIT. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT SPECIFY HOW MUCH TIME SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ADEQUATE IN A TIME LIMITED DEMAND SETTLEMENT. S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE WILL CREATE REASONABLE FEARS AND GUIDELINES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED WHEN A TIME LIMITED DEMAND IS MADE TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY. THIS BILL WILL HELP INSURERS MEET THEIR OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS THOROUGHLY AND PROMPTLY BY REQUIRING INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION BE INCLUDED IN A PLAINTIFFS THE- TIME LIMITED DEMAND WHICH WILL HELP SPEED UP THE PROCESS. SB ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE CONTAINS NO PROVISIONS TO CREATE UNNECESSARY STEPS. PLAINTIFF TO FOLLOW TO SETTLE THEIR CLAIM THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IS WRITTEN CLEARLY FOR THE PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY TO OUTLINE WHAT INFORMATION IS NEEDED BY THE DEFENDANT. TO ENSURE ACCESS TO A TIMELY SET SETTLEMENT TESTIFYING REMOTELY IN SUPPORT IS PETER KLAY AN EXPERT ATTORNEY REPRESENTING SHEPPARD MULLIN. THANK YOU SIR CABALLERO WE WILL NOW GO ON TO THE LINE IN SUPPORT WITH PETER KLAY. PETER FOR THEIR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN YEAH HERE CLICK HERE YES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK BECAUSE I HAVE A BACKGROUND THAT PROVIDES ME WITH THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE REGARDING THESE ISSUES I'VE BEEN HANDLING. CASES INVOLVING INSURANCE CLAIMS HANDLING ISSUES FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE RIDER GUIDE INSURANCE LITIGATION PRACTICE GUIDE WHICH IS CALIFORNIA'S LEADING TREATISE ON INSURANCE LAW. AND SO I HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE TRENCHES I LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ALONE I'VE HANDLED LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CASES INVOLVING THE ISSUES IMPLICATED BY THE- THIS BILL. IN ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THOSE CASES. THE INSURANCE COMPANY WANTED TO SETTLE WITHIN THE POLICY LIMIT AND MADE AN OFFER TO DO SO. REFUSE TO SETTLE FOR THE POLICY LIMIT BASED ON AN ARGUMENT. THAT THE- INSURANCE COMPANY HAD AN EARLIER OPPORTUNITY. TO ACCEPT THE TIME LIMITED DEMAND BUT DIDN'T ACCEPT IT. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT IN MOST OF THESE CASES. RESENT THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY DIDN'T ACCEPT THE EARLIER TIME WHEN THE DEMAND WAS BECAUSE AT THAT POINT IN TIME IT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO FAIRLY EVALUATE THE CLAIM OR THE TIME LIMIT WAS. SHORT IF FOR THE DEMAND INCLUDED CONDITIONS THAT WERE CALCULATED TO BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO TRIP UP AND NOT ACCEPT THE DEMAND. TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE CASES THAT COULD AND SHOULD BE SETTLED FOR THE INSURANCE POLICY LIMITS. BUT THEY AREN'T AND THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. AND ONE THING THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY NOT REALIZE IS THAT WELL THE BILL IS HELPFUL TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. MOST IMPORTANT BENEFICIARIES OF THE BILLS AREN'T INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT OUR POLICYHOLDERS HEATING THE PEOPLE WHO. CURRENTS YOU KNOW TECH THEMSELVES FROM MY BILL. AND TO UNDERSTAND WHY POLICY HOLDERS ARE THE ONES THAT BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. WHY INSURANCE BAD FAITH LAW EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE LAW THAT REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANY JUST TO SETTLE CASES. WITHIN THE LIMITS WHEN THEY KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW THAT IF THEY DON'T THERE'S GOING TO BE AN EXCESS JUDGMENT AGAINST THEIR POLICY HOLDERS. IF THAT HAPPENS IN THE INSURANCE COMPANY CAN BE LIABLE FOR THAT ACT THIS JUDGMENT. SO THE LAW OF BAD FAITH WAS CREATED. BY THE COURTS FOR TWO REASONS FIRST WHICH TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC POLICY THAT FAVORS SETTLEMENTS. AND SECOND. TO PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS FROM BEING DRAGGED THROUGH LITIGATION AND BEING SUBJECTED TO ACCESS JUDGMENTS. THE PURPOSE OF BAD FAITH LAW BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS VERY LAW THAT WAS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE SETTLEMENTS AND PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS. HAS BEEN WEAPONIZED TO. BE USED FOR THE EXACT OPPOSITE PER PURPOSE AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. IS THAT BASED ON THIS LAW ANYTIME THERE IS A- CLAIM INVOLVING INJURIES AND DAMAGES THAT EXCEED THE AVAILABLE INSURANCE. THE GOAL OF THE PLAINTIFF IS NOT IT SETTLE FOR THE POLICY LIMIT BUT RATHER. TO CREATE AN IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SETTLE FOR THE POLICY LIMIT. SO THAT THEY CAN ARGUE LATER THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR WHATEVER JUDGMENT HAPPENS AND THEY DO THAT. BY MAKING DEMANDS THAT THEY KNOW WON'T BE ACCEPTED BECAUSE EITHER THE TIME LIMIT IS TOO SHORT. OR THE AND FOR IN THE THEY'RE NOT- ACCOMPANIED BY ADEQUATE INFORMATION FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY CAN FAIRLY EVALUATE WHAT THE DAMAGES ARE WORTH OR THEY MAY ENGAGE IN OTHER TACTICS TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY. HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SETTLE BUT THEN THEY ARGUE THAT CURRENT COMPANY SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING JUDGMENT BUT WHO IS THE TRUE VICTIM OF THIS TACTIC THE TRUE VICTIM. IS THE POLICY HOLDER- BECAUSE THERE IS NO SETTLEMENT IS DRAGGED THROUGH SOMETIMES YEARS OF LITIGATION AND SOMETIMES SUBJECTED. TO AN EXCESS JUDGMENT THAT IS PUT ON THE RECORD ALL BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF THE TACTIC THAT IS. DESIGNED TO TRY- MAKE. COMPANY PAY MORE THAN POLICY LIMIT AND LIKE I INDICATED IN IN MANY AND I WOULD SAY MOST OF THE CASES IN WHICH- THERE IS NOT A POLICY MINISTER. BECAUSE YOU SURE AS COMPANY THANK YOU MR ALLEY UTILITY. THANK YOU M. I. A. R. MY FOR MINUTES AT YOUR FOUR MINUTES ARE UP. SO MAYBE YOU GOT ONE MORE SENTENCE. I DO I MY FILES AND IT SIMPLY THAT IS IT IS SIMPLY THAT THE BILL DOES NOT PROTECT INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT DON'T WANT TO ACT FAIRLY THE CARD RIGHT OR IF INSURANCE IS NOT ONE ACTUAR LEASES IN THAT SO THAT SO LET'S A LONG SENTENCE THANK YOU SIR ALL RIGHT I JUST NEED YOU SUPPORT THE BILL. SOME ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT. BEING THAT THERE'S NO OTHER WITNESSES- PRIMARY WITNESSES. ANYWAY THIS IS HERE IN THE CHAMBER. AERIAL IF YOU PRODUCE A MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS ALSO EIGHTY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA VERY HAPPY SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR I THINK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL AND WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH MYSTICALLY.

ALL RIGHT LET'S NOW TURN TO OPPOSITION- THOSE IN OPPOSITION MISTER PETERS WE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION- MR HAREL GO AHEAD MISS PETERS MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M CRAIG PETERS PRESIDENT OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ON S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE IN LIGHT OF THE AUTHOR'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE CAN AMENDMENTS. HE NOW HAS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. LONGSTANDING LAW REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ACT REASONABLY WITH THEIR POLICIES HOPE POLICYHOLDERS INTERESTS IN MIND WHEN EVALUATING SETTLEMENT DEMANDS. IF THEY FAILED TO ACT REASONABLY AND REFUSED TO ACCEPT A SETTLEMENT OFFER THE COULD A BIT PROTECTED THEIR POLICY HOLDER THEN THE INSURER CAN BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF AN INJURED PARTIES DAMAGES. THIS IS A SIMPLE STRAIGHT FORWARD STANDARD THAT SERVED CALIFORNIA WELL TO ENSURE ONE. INJURED INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THE RECOVER DESERVE TO POLICY HOLDERS ARE PROTECTED BY THEIR INSURERS. AND THREE INSURERS TO ACT REASONABLY ARE PROTECTED BY THE LAW. THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED FIFTY YEARS OF CASE LAW THE SPONSORS BILL WOULD HAVE SHIFTED THE BURDEN FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO THE INJURED PARTIES. ATTEMPTING TO CREATE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL LAUNDRY LIST OF CRITERIA THAT AN INJURED PARTY WOULD HAVE TO SATISFY OR RISK HAVING THEIR REASONABLE STATEMENT DEMAND REJECTED. THAT'S WHAT THE LATE JUSTICE FOR INJURED INDIVIDUALS EVEN WHEN. WAS CLEAR AND REASONABLE DOCUMENTATION THAN I DID I JUST LIKE TO SAY PARENTHETICALLY THAT THE ISSUE RAISED EARLIER ABOUT HOW IT IS THE SURE THAT IS THE ONE THAT IS AT RISK HERE THAT'S NOT TRUE IT IS THE INSURERS PRESTADOS WHY THEY'RE THE ONES SPONSORING THIS BILL AND THERE BE A SIMPLE MIDI DO. BRING THIRD PARTY BY FAITH ALL THAT. WE ARE THE HARD WORK OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS MOVING FORWARD THANKS VERY MUCH NAME SPEAK MISTER HARRIS.

WE AT THIS MOMENT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE DO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE- CHAIRMAN THE CHAIRMAN THE AUTHOR. AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES IN NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THE BILL. I THOUGHT THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS WAY TOO BROAD. A BIT OF A INSURANCE COMPANY FISHING EXPEDITION IF YOU WILL WE APPRECIATE THE DIRECTIONS GOING WE THINK IT WILL PROBABLY NEED SOME MORE WORK WE'RE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE THE LAW TO THE POINT INCLUDING MORE REPENT- OF THE FARMERS CASE. WAS TRYING TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE. EVERYTHING WILL BE A APPRECIATE AMENDMENT. AND CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR TO SPEAK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD IN THE PROCESS THANK YOU HERE THE CHAMBER IN SUPPORT OF S. B. I'M SORRY. STRIKE THAT OPPOSITION S. B.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OBVIOUSLY I'M PRESENTING SP TEN SEVENTY NINE WHICH WOULD ALLOW A PILOT FOR SIX CITIES TO OPERATE A VEHICLE NOISE WAS ADMITTED YOU DID YOU ACCEPT THE AT LEAST SOME OF THE MEMBERS PROPOSE SAN FORTINO THERE ARE NONE THEY'RE ALL I'M SORRY. OKAY I WILL I WILL MAKE SOME UP AT THE END SO OKAY. THANK YOU. I'M DEFINITELY WRITTEN IT RIGHT RIGHT. THIS ABOUT. THIS THE PORTANTINO OF YOURS THE CAMARADERIE IN COMEDY IS APPRECIATED- IT IS CURRENTLY ILLEGAL TO MODIFY FECAL IN ANYWAY THAT AMPLIFIES THE NOISE EMITTED BY VEHICLES FOR THE AVERAGE SIZE CAR THEY CANNOT EMIT SOUNDS GREATER THAN NINETY FIVE DECIBELS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO UNIVERSAL MEANS TO MONITOR AND ENFORCE THESE LAWS- EXPOSURE TO LOUD SOUNDS INCLUDING NOISE FROM VEHICLE EXHAUST SYSTEMS CAN HARM OUR HEALTH AND WELL BEING BY CONTRIBUTING TO HYPERTENSION HEARING LOSS SLEEPING DIFFICULTIES INCREASE STRESS LEVELS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CYCLE PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT ISSUES ADDITIONALLY LOUD VEHICLE NOISE ALSO PUTS PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS AT RISK WHILE THEY ARE ON THE ROAD AND OFTENTIMES THIS LOUD VEHICLE NOISES ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER RECKLESS BEHAVIORS. SUCH AS STREET RACING AND SET ASIDE SHOWS WHICH FURTHER ENDANGER LIVES I KNOW THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY WHENEVER YOU INTRODUCE NEW TECHNOLOGY IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ASK THE PROPORTIONS SAYS STOP AND TAKE A BREATH- AND BE THOUGHTFUL AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND WE- MANY MANY. TWISTS THE ACTIVISTS ON ALL SIDES OF THIS- MY STAFF TELLS ME ALMOST DAILY MEETINGS HAVE BEEN GOING ON- ON THIS BILL ARE THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES WHERE WE DISAGREE- BUT WE'VE TAKEN MUCH OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE GOT. AND HERE'S WHERE I THINK THE CHAIR- WAS GOING WE ARE PROPOSING OUR OWN AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONDITION MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED OR REYES IN BOTH THE NOW ASSISTANT FROM. THE ACTIVIST AND SO HERE ARE THE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENTS WERE PROPOSING WE'RE ADDING A PUBLIC INPUT AND PUBLIC HEARING REQUIREMENTS. THE REQUIREMENT TO CREATE A SOUND ACTIVATED ENFORCEMENT DEVICE USE POLICY AT EACH PARTICIPATING CITY. OF FURTHER SPECIFYING THAT SIGNAGE DETAILS MUST BE PRESENT WE'RE GOING TO CLARIFY THAT ONCE A VIOLATION OCCURS THERE IS A THIRTY WIN THE THIRTY DAY WINDOW WHEN NO VIOLATION WILL BE GIVEN AGAIN TO ALLOW TIME FOR PREPARES. FOR CONTESTING THE VIOLATION AND REALLY NOT PILING ON TO SOMEBODY. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE EQUIPMENT THAT CAN BE USED INCLUDING THE IMMEDIATE DELETION AND THIS IS IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE DELETION OF ANY DATA THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN A VIOLATION. AND SPECIFY THE HIGHLY REVIEWED MANUALLY ADDITIONAL. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL INCLUDE AN ANNUAL REPORT AND CONTRACTING PROVISIONS THAT INCLUDE THE FOR PROHIBITING OF PAYMENTS ARE COMPENSATION BASED ON THE NUMBER OF- VIOLATIONS WE THINK THAT MAKES IT STRONGER AND FRANKLY WE'VE HEARD. FROM THE CONCERNS THAT. SINCE OUR- THE TO WITH AS MANY. AS POSSIBLE NOW TRUTHFUL FUNDAMENTALLY WE CAN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF. WHETHER THE SHOULD BE USED OR NOT THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT AND MY ARGUMENT. TO SOME FOLKS IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE WITH TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO APPROPRIATELY CHANGE WITH TECHNOLOGY BE THOUGHTFUL AND WHETHER IT'S TODAY OR NEXT YEAR OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW- THIS TECHNOLOGY ISN'T GOING TO. BE AN WE IS BY LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS MUST COME UP WITH THE APPROPRIATE- PLAN THAT RESPECTS PRIVACY THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THE DATA TO BE USED THAT ALSO RESPECTS FOLKS WHO MAY BE CAUGHT INNOCENTLY AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO PENALTY FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION THAT'S WHY THERE'S A THIRTY DAY RIGHT TO CURE- SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS PRAGMATIC. AND A POSSIBLE AS WE ADAPT TO TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES AND SO WE THINK WE HIT THE SWEET SPOT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF THE PARTIES AS WE'VE BEEN DOING THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS- AND- OBVIOUSLY WHEN APPROPRIATE I'LL ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BUT I ALSO HAVE BUBBLE FISH. WHO IS WITH OUR SPONSOR STREETS WERE ALL WHO'S GOING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ALL RIGHT MR BY THE FISH AND FLOWS YEARS. THANK YOU UNDER PORTANTINO FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND THANK YOU TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE SUCCEEDING THANK YOU FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- AND- CENTER I'M BURKE FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF IT TODAY. MY NAME IS BUT THE FISH L. PLATED ADVOCATE AT STREETS FOR ALL IN L. A. COUNTY NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO STATE ACCOUNTABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION. WITH THE PROUD SPONSOR SB. TEN SEVENTY NINE AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. LUCIEN IS NOT MERE A NEWS- IT'S A GROWING. HEALTH IN OUR- ACCORDING TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE U. N. REPORT IN FEBRUARY HE DECLARED URBAN NOISE POLLUTION ONE OF THE WORLD'S QUOTE. MERGING ENVIRONMENTAL. BUT STUDY IN TWENTY NINETEEN BY THE PARENTS REGIONAL. HEALTH AGENCY. FOUND NOISE WAS CUTTING THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF PARISIANS BY TEN POINT SEVEN MONTHS. LARGE SCALE STUDIES SHOW THAT NOISE EXPOSURE OVER MANY YEARS INCREASES YOUR RISK OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE CORONARY HEART DISEASE AND HEART ATTACKS OR STROKES DIABETES DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION. CHILDREN SUFFER NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY BUT BEHAVIORALLY AND COGNITIVELY AND WANTED TO READING SCORES OF SIXTH GRADERS MORE NEARBY URBAN ONLY ALLOWED NEARLY A YEAR BEHIND THOSE OF STUDENTS IN QUITE OUR CLASSROOMS A DIFFERENT A DISAPPEARED ONE SOUNDPROOFING MATERIALS WERE INSTALL. ARBIL USES THE NINETY DECIBEL AMERICAN LEGAL LIMIT BUT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DEFINES A THRESHOLD FOR CARDIO VASCULAR DISORDERS AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE FROM ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE. AT HIGH DECIBELS OR HIGHER. I AM EXPERT FROM THE AS I LIVE ON WASHABLE ONE OF THE BUSIEST QUARTERS OF CULVER CITY. AN ILLEGALLY MODIFIED MUFFLERS DISTURBING UNITY ON A DAILY BASIS THE PROBLEM IS ONLY EXACERBATED AS YOU CAN OF COURSE HAVE SURGED IN POPULARITY. THE NOISE LEVELS PRODUCED IT ALREADY LEGAL I DON'T ENFORCEMENT THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. SB CAN SEVENTY NINE WILL ALLOW CITIES TO ENFORCE THE LAW WITHOUT ARMED POLICE ENFORCEMENT. IT'S AUTOMATED NOISE IMPORTANT PROGRAM IS MODELED ON THOSE ALREADY IN PLACE IN PARIS NASHVILLE NEW YORK CITY. ANY DEVICE COULD NOT BE FOUND ACTIVATED MEANING THE IMAGES ARE ONLY STATE ON THE TWENTY LEGALLY LOUD MUFFLER SOUNDS ACTED. OTHERWISE THAT DATED IMMEDIATELY DELETED. AND WE TREAT FIVE WORK CLOSELY WITH OPPOSITION GROUPS ACLU ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND THE FIRST TO TELL LIKE. TO ADD MANY PROVISIONS TO PROTECT. PRIVACY AND- HELP NOT HARM PERSONALIZED COMMUNITIES OFTEN DOES. IMPACTED BY ST RACING NIGHT SCHOOL. FROM EQUITY PER WE LOOK TO CONCERNS CHANGE THE TO A STICK MILE PROGRAM WITH THE FIND THE NOT ADDED A WORN FOR FIRST TIME BY IT OPPORTUNIST FOR LOW INCOME ON. ABOUT HER PERIOD BETWEEN VIOLATIONS WERE NO ADDITIONAL VIOLATIONS CAN BE ISSUED IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE REVENUES OF THIS PROGRAM ARE EARMARKED TO BE USED FOR TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES TO MAKE OUR STREETS AND COMMUNITY STAKE BURKE AND WE'RE WORKING TO SEE IF WE CAN INCLUDE A WAY TO HELP FOLKS WITH THESE DEVICES SWAP. OUT FOR A LEGAL ONE ON THE PRICEY SIDE WE ADDED PROVISIONS MANDATE PROCEEDED TO DESTROY UPON THE RESOLUTION OF VIOLATIONS INCLUDED REQUIREMENT TO DELETE THE DATA UPON RESOLUTION OF THE TICKET. AND THEN MANDATED YEARLY AUDIT OF THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE IT ALSO ADDED INCLUDE DETAILED REQUIREMENTS EACH VIOLATION INCLUDING EVIDENCE. IN A CLEAR DISPUTE. THE SPECIFIED PROGRAM IS RUN BY TRANSFER. DEPARTMENT NOT LONG. SIMILAR TO A PARKING TICKET. AND IT PROHIBITS THE USE OF THE DATA FROM THESE VIOLATIONS TO BE USED IN ANY OTHER MANNER OTHER THAN THE ISSUING THE TICKETS BY ANY OTHER AGENCY. I URGE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND HELP US CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON OUR SHARED GOAL OF CREATING PEACEFUL. I'LL BE URBAN ENVIRONMENTS FOR EVERYONE THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN Q. RT THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY. LET'S NOW TURN TO OPPOSITION. I HAVE- BECCA KRAMER MILDER IN OPPOSITION. DAVID BECKER KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION HE WENT SEVEN EIGHT TEN SEVENTY NINE. DESPITE THE AUTHORED GOOD INTENTIONS AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM BUT THOSE OPERATED BY THE CELEBRATE MEMORY HI THIS AND EQUITY CONCERNS. I AND FAIRNESS OF NINE ACTIVE SURVEY TECHNOLOGY QUESTIONABLE AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN MANY PLACES THAT HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PORTSMOUTH FOR REDUCTION OF THE UNDERLYING EIGHT POINT 7% OF THE ALERT FROM DYNAMITE ACTIVATED SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES WERE FOUND HAVE BEEN INACCURATE WELL REPORT ON THE TECHNOLOGY FOUND THAT IT HAD NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GUN RELATED HOMICIDES OVER TWO DECADES AND ACROSS. EACH JURISDICTION. FINEST TECHNOLOGY TO LOUD VEHICLES REASONS EVEN GREATER CONCERNS ABOUT ITS ACCURACY AND EFFECTIVENESS. IT IS UNABLE TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE WHETHER A GUN WAS FIRED IN A PARTICULAR AREA HOW CAN THIS TECHNOLOGY ACCURATELY DETERMINE WHETHER A VEHICLE EXCEEDED THE LEGAL LIMIT A NICE LEVEL. SPECIALLY WITH VARYING NOISE LIMITS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE IN THE YEAR OF THE VEHICLE LET ALONE WHICH VEHICLE IN A CROWDED ROADWAY WITH MULTIPLE LANES IS TRIGGERING THE SOUND ACTIVATED ENFORCEMENT THAT I. NOT AND QUESTION PILOT PROGRAM CAN'T FOR EXAMPLE DEMOCRATS. COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WORKERS OF NOISE OR IDENTIFIES. VEHICLES THE PRECISION REQUIRED BY COURT. BACK WE MIGHT MONTH PALETTE HI THE CITY A HUNDRED NINETY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. BIRKENAU COSTS AND YIELDED ONLY ONE ENFORCEMENT OF MY POLLUTION NOT. THE AUTHOR THAT HAVE TO INCLUDE PRIVATE ACT PROVIDE. HOWEVER IN THE BILL FALLS SHORT DEFINITELY THE BILL RATE IS IMPORTANT PASS A QUESTION. THE NEED FOR REDUCING NOISE POLLUTION DOES NOT WARRANT THE CREATION OF A NEW MECHANISM FOR GOVERNMENT COLLECTION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA ON CALIFORNIA. REALLY IN LIGHT OF THE HIGH ERROR AND THEN OF THE TO. THAT NOT. ACTUALLY I YOUR BUT THANK YOU PARTY THANK YOU OTHER ENOUGH. HERE IN THE CHAMBER SAYING NO ONE IN THE CHAMBER ON THE PHONE LINE. MODERATE WE QUEUE UP THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. TEN SEVENTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN. THE MEAT LET ME INTERRUPT YOU A MODERATOR- J. BIEBER. IS ALSO IN OPPOSITION MR BIEBER ARE YOU AVAILABLE. I AM THANK YOU GO AHEAD A GOOD AFTERNOON TO TERMS OF GERMAN NUMBER AGAIN COMMITTEE MEMBERS SET UP FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SAFE STREETS LA PERSON WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR TO STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US IN GOOD FAITH AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS MANY OF OUR CONCERNS. HOWEVER A NUMBER OF ISSUES ARE STILL OUTSTANDING SUCH AS LIMITING HOW ANY EXCESS REVENUE CAN BE USED TO ENSURE THAT THESE DEVICES ARE NOT USED AS A REVENUE GENERATING PROGRAM. AND INCLUDING LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THE PILOT PROGRAM CANNOT BE EXPANDED OR EXTEND THE REQUIRED REPORT BACK TO. YOUR HAS BEEN RECEIVED AND EVALUATED WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT UNDER A PILOT PROGRAM THE NUMBER OF DEVICES FOR SIX P. SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT. THEIR OTHER CONCERNS ARE OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. GIVEN THE GOOD APPLICATION HOWEVER WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY. CANNOT WORK UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. USE RELATING TO IS AUTHOR TO ISSUE. AND IN TWO UNIVERSE. PARTY FOR THIS VIOLATION. IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW AS WRITTEN. TICKET ISSUED BY THE SYSTEMS WOULD LIKELY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE. PASSING SUCH A LAW WOULD BE ILL ADVISED AND IT WOULD LEAD TO NUMEROUS LEGAL CHALLENGES AND SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE TO WILLFUL VIOLATORS. TRYING TO FIX THESE ISSUES WOULD BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE VEHICLE APPEAL CODE SOMETHING THAT WOULD IMPLICATE DUE PROCESS CONCERNS IN GARNER. SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL WELLS PROPOSITION. THEREFORE WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR SERIOUSLY CONSIDER AMENDING THE BILL TO ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO BE USED FOR INVESTIGATORY PURPOSES ONLY. AND NOT TO DIRECTLY ISSUE TICKETS. THIS WOULD RESOLVE THE FATAL LEGAL FLAWS IN THE BILL AS WELL AS ADDRESS ANY OF OUR CONCERNS. ABOUT THE SYSTEMS. LACK OF ACCURACY. YEAH COMMITTEE SUPPORTED TAKING THE BILL IN THIS DIRECT. BARRING THAT WE WERE. ASK YOUR NEW ABOUT. THE YOU MR BEAVER OKAY- NOW MODERATE YOU TO THOSE AND- TO S. B. TEN SEVENTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF SB TEN SEVENTY NINE. YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME.

REMEMBER HEAVILY AT THE END SAID WITH CORBIN AND HI THERE ON BEHALF OF ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THE AUTHOR AND PONDERED HAVE HAD WITH THE F.

YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS TRACY ROSENBERG FROM OPEN PRIVACY WE'VE ALSO BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR THAT WILL BE CONTINUING AND- THE AMENDMENTS LOOK COULD BE ADDRESSING ALREADY SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ARE YOU IN OPPOSITION MOMENT OURS. COOPER THANK YOU UP IF WE COULD ASK THOSE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO PROVIDE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION THEIR POSITION. MODERATE TO GO AHEAD. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE YES BUSTER WAS CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IN TRANSPORTATION YOU TOOK A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT. REALLY FINE TUNED- THE BILL MAKING IT MAX SIX CITIES TO PILOT PROGRAM VERSUS STATEWIDE- BUT THE ISSUE OF COURSE STILL REMAINS ON THE PRIVACY CONCERNS OF COURSE AS MENTIONED I KNOW YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH IT THE OPPOSITION'S I'D JUST LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS IF YOU WANT TO ADD THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES THAT'S FINE TOO- THE- EQUITY CONCERNS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE. I I'M IN LONG BEACH AND- IN SOME PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE UNDERSERED IT IS VERY LOUD NATURALLY AND SO HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH WHAT IS WHAT- AND THIS TECHNOLOGY IS FAIRLY NEW IN ITS FIRST ITERATION AND I NEVER WANT TO STOP INNOVATION BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEEN VETTED. TO SOME DEGREE THAT IT DOESN'T IMPOSE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FOR FOLKS. THANK YOU OF THAT. ALL RIGHT. AND JUST TO CLARIFY A POINT THAT I MAY HAVE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU REFERRED TO CENTER pPORTANTINO REMEMBERS THAT YOU'RE PREPARED TO TAKE ON THE FLOOR. AND I THINK THE BILL WAS LARGELY CRAFTED SO YOU WOULD AVOID THE PERILOUS PROCESS IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND SO IT GOES STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR IS THAT RIGHT. I THINK IT GOES TO APPROACH. BUT IT'S GOING RIGHT TO THE FLOOR YOU'RE RIGHT I THOUGHT IT WAS COMING TO ME. BUT IT'S GOING RIGHT TO WE WILL TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS ON THE FLOOR ON THE- OTHER PEOPLE ON APPROACH TO AND NOW I AYE BUT- YES UNDERSTAND THERE MEMBERS TAKEN TRANSPORTATION THERE ARE OTHERS. AMENDMENTS THAT ALREADY- SO THAT ALREADY INTO LEDGE COUNCIL RIGHT THAT YOU'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ON. I ASKED THE QUESTION. THAT MAY HAVE CREATED SOME CONFUSION JUST TO. MAKE SURE WE ARE COMPLETELY CLEAR. THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE YOU HAVE SUGGESTED SOME AMENDMENTS. THAT YOU ARE PREPARED TO TAKE YOU'VE COMMITTED TO TAKE. THAT'LL BE ON THE FLOOR CORRECT SO OKAY ALL RIGHT. AND CLEAR THAT AND AS THE CHAIR TRANSPORTATION MENTION WE TOOK A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS IN HER COMMITTEE WHICH WE WERE. VERY HAPPY TO DO AND- THAT THOUGHT THERE COMMITTEE AS WELL. ALL RIGHT. BYE ELECTION THANK YOU CENTER THE RUSSELL. YEAH I WISH SIX COVERED HELICOPTERS THE- OVER. OUR COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THEY'RE LOUDER THAN ANYTHING ELSE ARE LOUDER THAN. ANY OF THE- RACERS THE COME DOWN THE STREET IT IS REALLY DISTURBING AND IT IS. IT REALLY BOTHERS OUR COMMUNITY A WHOLE LOT- HAVING SAID THAT- SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT SURE FROM WHERE HOW YOU MIGHT BE ADDRESSING THEM- IS THE- ACCURACY. OR INACCURACY. OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE BROUGHT UP- THAT'S ONE. WHICH THEN LEADS TO I THINK THERE WAS A- A RECORD OF THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU TEST THE TECHNOLOGY- PRIOR TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING GIVING TICKETS OUT. OF AND I THINK- SIMILAR DISSENTER GONZALEZ YOU KNOW THE EQUITY ISSUE. WHICH COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE. THE MY- THE NUMBER THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT IMPACT FOR COMMUNITIES MORE THAN THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES- AND- I TAKES MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS BUT IF A MOTORIST GETS A VIOLATION- RECEIVES A VIOLATION HOW DO THEY HOW DO THEY FIGHT THAT TICKET YOU KNOW. IF THEY GET A CITATION BACK- I KNOW I GOTTA TAKE IT ONCE. AND I TRIED TO FIGHT IT OF FOR GOING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION WITH A I WILL GO ANY MORE DETAILS BUT- THERE WAS RIGHT DO YOU VIEW IS THAT RIGHT DOES YOUR LAWYER I'D SUGGEST GO AHEAD. ANYWAY IT WAS A PICTURE WITH YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT CAMERON THE INTERSECTION AND- NO MATTER WHAT I DID I JUST I JUST COULDN'T FIGHT FIGHT THAT TICKET BUT THAT'S OBVIOUS I MEAN THAT IS CLEAR CUT- I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE. SOMEBODY COULD. OF BY THE CITATION FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF MY- QUESTIONS- WALTZ JUST DO WITHOUT IF YOU WITH THE CHURCH BELLS AND SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING TO NARROW THIS TO GET AT THE HEART OF THE MATTER AND I WOULD. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT IN UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES IN IN IN SOME OF THE VERY PLACES WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES WHICH WE SHOULD BE. AYE NOISES ALSO. SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES JUST ON THE NATURAL QUIETER. AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THOSE URBAN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM NOISE POLLUTION SO THAT'S PART OF WHY WE'RE DOING THIS- FOR THE SOCIAL INEQUITY JUST ON THE NOISE POLLUTION ISSUE. AS FAR AS THE CITATION THE FIRST- TIME IT CAPTURES YOU IT'S A WARNING. SO THERE IS NO CITATION THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENS AND SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT FOLKS HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD AS WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF A MISTAKE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S PARKED AT THAT INTERSECTION NEXT TO THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY HAS THE LEGAL SO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT PERSON WOULD BE CAPTUREDA SECOND TIME. WHO IS INNOCENT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE SAME CIRCUMVENT THEY BE AT THE SAME INTERSECTION NEXT TO THE SAME PERSON WHO WAS ACTUALLY CAUSING THE NOISE PROBLEM SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO CAPTURE THAT INNOCENT PERSON OR THE THIRD OF THE A RONI IS BYSTANDER WHO GETS. THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA GET THEM A SECOND I'M JUST A TYPICALLY THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN. FOR THE PERSON WHO HAS. ILLEGALLY MODIFIED MUFFLER WHO IS CAUSING THE NOISE POLLUTION WE'RE GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO CURE THAT. WE'RE GIVING THEM WE'RE ACTUALLY EVEN LOOKING AT A AT A AT A AT A MONETARY WAY TO TRY TO FINANCE THAT- BUT IF YOU'RE A HABITUAL. PERSON WHO WHO MIGHT ILLEGALLY MODIFIED YOUR CAR TO. YOU KNOW EXCEED THE DECIBEL LEVEL IN YOUR CONTINUE TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE YOU KEEP GETTING CAUGHT- YOU KNOW THAT'S THE PERSON WE'RE GOING AFTER SO WE'RE TRYING TO PUT AS MANY GUARD RAILS AROUND. THE INNOCENT BYSTANDER AND THE PERSON. THAT I ANALYZE I SAID WE'RE EVEN LOOKING AT SOME FINANCIAL. FINANCIAL HELP SO WE'RE TAKING ALL THOSE COMMENTS TO HEART AND WE'RE TRYING AND AS FAR AS- TESTING IT IS A NARAL PILOT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIX CITIES. OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THOSE CITIES WOULD HAVE TO OPT IN AS WELL. AND THE BILL HAS BUILT IN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BEFORE SHE CAN EVEN ENACT. THE POLICY THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION DISCUSSION. LET'S SAY THERE'S A COMMUNITY OVW'S LONG BEACH SINCE HE WAS BROUGHT UP IF ONE BEACH WANTS TO DO IT. LONG BEACH HAS TO HAVE A ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS BEFORE THEY EVEN ENACT. THE POLICY WITH DEFINED. WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING IT AND WITH THE GUARD RAILS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE WHICH AS AS BOB MENTIONED WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS BEING ENFORCED BY THE POLICE FORCE BY IT'S GOING TO BE. YOU. KNOW DONE BY THAT. PASSED BY OF A CITY NOT THE LAWN. EFFORTS THE SELF. YOU KNOW I THINK MAKING SURE THAT THE CITY HAS THAT ROBUST PUBLIC. DISCOURSE BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTED WHERE ACTIVISTS CAN COME FORWARD AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT HERE'S WHO WE LIKE IT WE DON'T LIKE OR WE DON'T WANT IT. YOU KNOW THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CITY'S NOT MANDATING THAT ANY CITY DOES THIS. BUT I SHOULD HEAR THERE ARE A BUNCH THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT WANT TO DO IT. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO DEFINE THAT ALTHOUGH SAFEGUARDS WITHIN THAT PROCESS AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT STRONGER. PARTY THANK YOU. BOB THURSTON. THAN CYNICAL BO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATED THE DIALOGUE SO FOR- I THINK IT'S JUST WORTH NOTING THAT WE'RE WE'RE IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- AND THE CREATIVITY. OF THE APPROACH YOU'VE TAKEN HERE I THINK IS LAUDABLE AND THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE BASICALLY BEING COMPLETELY IGNORED. AND WE WENT THROUGH A VERY TOUGH PROCESS TO GET THOSE BILLS PASSED I WORKED ON. THE BILL THAT IT INSTITUTED- SOME EXHAUST SYSTEM IN SOUND. A SOUND REQUIREMENTS ON MOTORCYCLES AND- CONSIDER PADLEY KERRY THAT LEGISLATION THAT WAS. I WAS SCARY THERE WERE THREATS- YOU KNOW SHE HAD TO BE. PROTECTED BY CHP DURING THE PASSAGE OF THAT BILL WHO CAME TO OUR OFFICE HER HOME- WE DID WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THAT THE HEAVY LIFT ON PUTTING. THESE REQUIREMENTS ON THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA LAW AND YET. THEY'RE BASICALLY BEING IGNORED AND THE QUESTION IN MY MIND IS WHETHER WE DIVERT. PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES TO TRYING TO MAKE THAT LETTER OF THE LAW MATTER- AWAY FROM SAY VIOLENT CRIME OR OTHER ISSUES THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE DEALING WITH AND DOWN TO VEHICLE CODE VIOLATION OR WHETHER WE TAKE SOME OTHER APPROACH I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THE AUTHORS MADE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THAT SORT OF ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS AND THEN ALSO. THE CURE RATE I MEAN SO THAT THEY WERE NOT UNDER CUTTING ANYBODY'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS HEARING THAT WE'RE WE'RE ENSURING THAT- THERE'S AN ABILITY TO CHALLENGE ANY ANY SORT OF YOUR RONI IS- THE RONI'S VIOLATION. BUT TO ME THIS IS. IT'S FISCALLY IMPORTANT POLICY BUT ALSO AS A MATTER OF SORT OF. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE NOT TO HAVE THIS BE JUST ON LAW ENFORCEMENT- TO HANDLE THIS- AND IN MANY CASES THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH- SO I I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED ON TO THE MEASURE THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND I WOULD MOVE THE BILL- IF IT HASN'T BEEN MOVED ALREADY. BUT I KNOW YOU KEEP WORKING WITH ALL PARTIES YOU'RE YOU'RE THE YOU'RE THE CONSUMMATE- COALITION BUILDER HERE AND I YOU KNOW. FOR THE CONSTITUENTS OUT THERE FOLKS LIKE MR BIEBER AND OTHERS. IT SOUNDS LIKE- THE CONCERN THAT WAS SORT OF QUOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THE BILLINGE. THE TO QUOTE SAFER STREETS THEY SAY THE BILL ENSURES THEY'LL BE ZERO GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE. THERE'S NO LONGER ZERO- SO I LOVE YOUR AND WHERE THE BILL IS HEADED. AND YEAH APPRECIATED. ARE ALL RIGHT- SUPPORT DO CARE TO RESPOND AS SINISTER'S COME ABOUT YOU BEING THE CONSUMMATE COALITION BUILDER YEAH I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT SENATE CABALLERO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE MOMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN YOU'VE GIVEN SOME REAL REAL IMPORTANT FIGHT TO IT- I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL WHEN I. AND I HAD A WATCH AND TO SEE WHAT AMENDMENTS FIXTURE WAS GOOD BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THEM AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU A SENATOR AND I HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO MY STAFF. THEY HAVE BEEN ON ALMOST DAILY CALLS WITH.
