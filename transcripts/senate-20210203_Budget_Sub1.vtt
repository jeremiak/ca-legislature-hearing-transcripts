IT GOING BACK UP BUT NOT TO THE

LOCALLY IN ORANGE COUNTY- AND

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.883
OF COURSE ACROSS THE STATE- IS

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.518
ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT AS FAR AS

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:33.820

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:33.479
ISSUES HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.780

AS THEIR ENROLLMENT HAS CLIMBED

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:47.793

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.442
CHEFS ALL IN ALL WE THINK THAT

THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.780
PLAINTIFFS ATTENTIVE BOTH TO

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:00.252
HOWEVER YOU RECOMMEND THE

AN UPDATE ON STATE REVENUES AND

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:05.857
THAT'S A BETTER SENSE OF HOW

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:07.526
MUCH OF AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:11.063

SUPPORT PROPOSAL DOES COME WITH

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:15.734
CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS. RELATING

OTHER FACTORS. IN GENERAL WE

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:21.606
THINK THAT WITH THESE

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:22.941
EXPECTATIONS THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:24.443
IDENTIFIED AREAS OF COMMON

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:25.877
CONCERN WITH THE LEGISLATURE.

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:28.313
BUT THERE ARE SOME

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:28.880

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:31.450

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:32.718
AREAWHERE LEGISLATIVE

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:33.585
OVERSIGHT IS PARTICULARLY

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:35.787
IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CSU

00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:45.163
SO THAT INCLUDES THE EQUITY GAP

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.531
METRICS THERE WOULD BE

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:48.100

NUMBER OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:54.372

ARBITRARY GOAL. AND SO WE

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:04.149
RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT 10%

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.350

ESTABLISHING A NEW TRANSFER

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:26.878
PROCESS- YEAH DID YOU DO ANY

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.747
STUDY ON THIS WHAT ARE THE PROS

AND CONS THAT YOU ON COVERED.

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:32.150
AND ONE OF THE PRIORITIES ARE

00:27:32.217 --> 00:27:33.952
POLICY GOALS YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:39.758

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:44.696

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:45.263
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS I

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.264
MENTIONED BEFORE IS VERY

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:48.066
FOCUSED ON ACCESS AND EQUITY

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:49.401
AND SO WE SEE THAT ALL

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:51.436
EMISSIONS AND- PROPOSAL AS

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.872
INCREASING ACCESS- AND EASING

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:56.307

OR UC- GOT IT ALTHOUGH I A DEAL

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:03.748
IT SEEMS LIKE. THIS PROPOSAL

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.884
WOULD NOT REALLY. TAKE INTO

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.185
ACCOUNT THE TWO YEARS OF ACTUAL

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:08.787
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PERFORMANCE

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:09.854
THAT WOULD PERSONALLY MATTER

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:11.322
BUT LET ME PUT THIS QUESTION TO

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:13.258
SEE IF YOU. HAVE YOU STUDY THIS

00:28:13.324 --> 00:28:14.826
PROPOSAL YET AND WHAT DO YOU

00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:19.330
SEE. AS YOUR PRELIMINARY- THAT

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:21.633
CONCERN OR- YOU KNOW IF IT'S A

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:22.400
OF THIS AT ONE OF THE- AND CONS

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:23.902
THAT YOU THINK MIGHT ACCOMPANY

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:26.571
THIS PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTER GOOD

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:27.539
MORNING AGAIN THIS IS NATHAN

00:28:27.605 --> 00:28:31.009
EVANS FROM CSU- AS MISS KING

00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:33.344
INDICATED EARLIER THE DETAILS

00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:35.213
OF THE PROPOSAL ARE JUST

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.815
BEGINNING TO COME FORTH AND SO

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:38.483
WE'RE REALLY JUST BEGINNING TO

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.585
LOOK AT THOSE. I WOULD SAY THAT

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:42.554
IT- CONCEPTUALLY BUILDS ON A

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.622
VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WHICH

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:45.423
IS THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.492
TRANSFER- WHICH IS HAS JUST

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.359
CELEBRATED ITS TENTH

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:49.794
ANNIVERSARY AND WE NOW SEE

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:51.996
THAT- QUICKLY BECOMING. THE

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.665
PRIMARY MECHANISM BY WHICH

00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:54.899
STUDENTS TRANSFER FROM

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.367
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:58.903
TO THE CSU. I THINK AS WAS

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.272
NOTED- WE'RE WE'RE JUST REALLY

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:02.774
BEGINNING TO LOOK AT WHAT THOSE

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:03.675
DETAILS WOULD BE AND AS YOU

00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:06.311
MENTIONED. IT'S DIFFICULT AT

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:08.079
THIS PINT TO FACTOR AND THEIR

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:09.080
EXPERIENCES STUDENTS WILL HAVE

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:10.148
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THAT

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:12.217
PROCESS I THINK CONCEPTUALLY WE

00:29:12.283 --> 00:29:12.984
UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.586
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO FIND

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:16.254
WAYS. SO THAT STUDENTS AND

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.856
FAMILIES HAVE A CLEAR PATH AS

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.424
THEY EXIT HIGH SCHOOL VIA A

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:21.960
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND HAVE. A

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:24.362
OF MORE- DEFINITIVE PLAN AS

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:25.597
THEY ENTER A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:29:25.663 --> 00:29:26.965
IN SETTING INSTEAD OF HAVING TO

00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:28.366
SEEK THAT OUT. I THINK THERE

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:29.501
MAY BE OTHER WAYS THAT THAT

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:30.902
COULD BE ACHIEVED USING THE AT

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:32.403
T. AS A VEHICLE BUT AGAIN WILL

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.005
REALLY NEED TO SPEND TIME

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:37.008
REALLY LOOKING AT THE ELEMENTS

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:38.309
OF THE PROPOSAL. GOT IT- MY

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:39.577
SECOND QUESTION IS A ONE THAT

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:40.778
FOLLOWS UP ON CHAIRMAN

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:43.148
LEONARD'S- LINE FIRST LINE OF

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:45.250
QUESTIONING AROUND WHY NOT BACK

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:46.618
TO THE KIND I GUESS. MAYBE I

00:29:46.684 --> 00:29:47.886
WANT TO POSIT IS IN A SLIGHTLY

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.287
DIFFERENT WAY THE GOVERNOR'S

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:51.089
BUDGET STRONGLY EMPHASIZES K.

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.191
THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS-

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:55.126
INCLUDING THE NEED TO REOPEN

00:29:55.193 --> 00:29:56.861
THE LEARNING LOSS THAT THEY'RE

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:57.662
FACING RIGHT NOW FROM DISTANCE

00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.964
LEARNING- I GUESS MY QUESTION

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:02.834
IS THIS- WE ALL I THINK. ASSUME

00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:04.002
TODAY THAT HIGHER ED IS VERY

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:06.104
IMPORTANT- THAT YOUNG PEOPLE

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:07.272
ARE TOLD THE CENTRAL YOU NEED A

00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:09.073
HIGHER DEGREE TO GET A GOOD

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.277
JOB- ANGEL WHY DO WE NOT HAVE

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:15.380
THE SAME EMPHASIS ON HIGHER ED.

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:16.414
THAT WE DO FOR K. THROUGH

AVENUES OF ACCESS TO A VARIETY

00:33:02.914 --> 00:33:04.682
OF STUDENT POPULATIONS. OUR

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:06.084
ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP ON OUR

PARADOXICAL SETTINGS FOR ALL

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.160
FOR THE USE OF ONLINE EDUCATION

SURVEY DATA SUGGESTED THAT AND

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.591
NOTABLE SHARE OF STUDENTS AT

MEETING CERTAIN BASIC NEEDS

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:53.597
PARTICULARLY SHOULDN'T HOUSING

BEEN EXACERBATED SINCE THE

00:38:58.569 --> 00:38:59.503
START OF THE PANDEMIC. I THINK

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.371
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.440
ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT AND

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:04.408
TIMELY PROBLEM. IMMEDIATELY

REYES AND OUR REPORT IS THAT IT

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:07.478
CONTINUES AS SOME PIECEMEAL

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:08.946
APPROACH ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.881
THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN OVER

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:19.090
SUMMARIZES THE PROGRAMS

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:20.791
LEGISLATURE IS FUNDED RELATING

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:24.361
TO BASIC NEEDS SINCE TWENTY

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:24.895
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. YOU'LL

NOTICE THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:27.331
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT I COULD

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:28.766
HAVE OVERLAPPING GOALS FOR

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:30.067
EXAMPLE SHOULDN'T HOUSING

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:31.535

HOUSING PROGRAM. MOREOVER

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.305
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE'S SOME

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:35.539
INCONSISTENCIES IN HOW THE

00:39:35.606 --> 00:39:36.774
STATE IS FUNDED BASIC NEEDS

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.909
ACROSS THE SEGMENTS COMPARING

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:39.844
YOU SEE TO SEE IF YOU FOR

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.213
EXAMPLE WE FEEL IN TWENTY

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:42.747
NINETEEN TWENTY THE STATE

ALL PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDS TO

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.187
SEE IF YOU FOR THE SAME PURPOSE

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:51.522
AS- WITH ALL THE CONTACTS IN

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:52.323
MIND WE RECOMMEND THE

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:53.424
LEGISLATURE ENSURE THAT IF IT

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:55.092
IS GOING TO CREATE. TWO NEW ON

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:56.594
GOING BASIC NEEDS PROGRAMS AT

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.396
CSU. THAT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:00.030
CLEARLY DEFINED AND MEASURABLE

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:01.899
OBJECTIVES. AND MOREOVER THAT

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:03.067
THE PROGRAMS ARE COORDINATED

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:04.268
WITH EACH OTHER AS WELL AS THE

00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:06.904
EXISTING INITIATIVES TO THE

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.672
STATE HAS IMPLEMENTED TODAY.

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:10.374
WHEN THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.408
COORDINATE THE ONE TIME FUNDS

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:12.676
FROM REGENCY FINANCIALLY IT

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:13.577
THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:15.279
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR CSU.

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:16.347
SPECIFICALLY IN THIS CASE WE

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:17.214
THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:18.582
COORDINATE THEM IN RELATION TO

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:19.950
THE FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THAT

00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:22.720
HAVE RECENTLY BECOME AVAILABLE

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.421
FOR VERY SIMILAR PURPOSE. THAT

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:25.756
COULD MEAN TARGETING THE STATE

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.191
FUNDING TOWARD STUDENTS ARE

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.359
EXCLUDED FROM THE FEDERAL

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:30.194
EMERGENCY IT FUNDING. FOR ALL

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:31.762
GENTLY EIGHTEEN TIMING THE

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:32.496
STATE FUNDS SO THAT THEY

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.598
ARRIVED AFTER THE FEDERAL FUNDS

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.168
HAVE DRIED UP. LOOKING LONG

00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:39.603
TERM IN THE BIGGER PICTURE.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.871
LEGISLATURE ALSO CONSIDER

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:42.106
TAKING STEPS TOWARD DEVELOPING

00:40:42.173 --> 00:40:44.141
A MORE HOLISTIC STRATEGY TOWARD

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:45.843
MEETING STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:46.811
STEPPING AWAY FROM THE MORE

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:48.979
PIECEMEAL APPROACH THAT THAT

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:49.580
THE STATE HAS TAKEN OVER THE

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.282
PAST FEW YEARS THIS WOULD OF

00:40:51.348 --> 00:40:52.783
COURSE INVOLVES A JOINT EFFORT

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.884
WITH THE SEGMENTS OTHER

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.019
STAKEHOLDERS AND IT WOULD MEAN

00:40:55.085 --> 00:40:56.086
ESTABLISHING OVER ARCHING

00:40:56.153 --> 00:40:57.354
OBJECTIVES FOR THE STATE'S

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:59.223
BASIC NEEDS PROGRAMS. DURING

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.191
THE AMOUNT OF NEED FOR THESE

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:01.559
PROGRAMS AND COORDINATING THE

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.160
PROGRAMS NOT ONLY WITH EACH

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:04.094
OTHER AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING

00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:05.830
BUT ALSO WITH TRADITIONAL

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.965
FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.233
ALSO INTENDED TO HELP STUDENTS

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.968
MAKE THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. AS

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.136
WELL THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:13.838
PROGRAMS PROGRAMS LIKE CALFRESH

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:14.538
THAT ARE INTENDED TO HELP

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:16.006
CALIFORNIANS IN GENERAL BUT

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:18.843
THIS TAX EXPENSES. THANK YOU

FINANCE. AND I WAS WONDERING IF

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:31.422
YOU COULD EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE

00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:33.791
FOR COMBINING MENTAL HEALTH

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:38.028
FUNDS WITH TECHNOLOGY FUNDS.

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:40.397
YES CERTAINLY SO I THINK IT'S

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:41.665
BEEN MADE PRETTY AWARE THAT THE

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:43.033
COMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.968
DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHTED SOME

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:46.904
ONGOING ISSUES FACING- STUDENTS

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.439
THAT ARE IN OUR VARIOUS HIGHER

00:41:48.505 --> 00:41:51.475
EDUCATION- INSTITUTIONS. SO WE

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.677
SAW A NEED AN INCREASED NEED

INTERNET AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESS

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:58.782
TO ADDRESS THAT THE

00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:59.583
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.051
FIFTEEN MILLION I'M ONGOING

00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:02.720
GENERAL FUND TO THIS YES YOU

FOR THESE PURPOSES. WELL THEN

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:08.092
JUST FOR THE RECORD MY QUESTION

00:42:08.158 --> 00:42:10.027
WAS WHY IT COMBINED. BUT NOT

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:11.829
THAT WE DON'T QUESTION WE

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:13.931
SUPPORT OF THE NEED FOR EACH

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.499
ONE BUT IT SORT OF MAKES THEM

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:16.834
COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:17.902
RATHER THAN SAYING THIS IS A

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.670
GOAL WILL SET ASIDE A CERTAIN

00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:21.338
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO MEET IT. AND

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:23.340
THIS IS A SECOND GOAL AND WILL

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.242
SET A CERTAIN SET OF. AMOUNT OF

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:26.710
MONEY TO MEET IT BECAUSE THERE

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:28.646
COULD BE SOME PLACES WHERE. OF

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.180
THE TECHNOLOGY NEED IS SO HIGH

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.749
AND APPROPRIATELY SO WITHIN

00:42:31.815 --> 00:42:32.917
MENTAL HEALTH GET SHORTED

00:42:32.983 --> 00:42:34.018
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T VIEW THAT

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:35.886
AS A PRIORITY SO I WOULD JUST

00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:37.288
OFFER THAT AS A CONSIDERATION

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:38.889
AS YOU HEAD TOWARD THE MAY

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:02.773
OF THE- REESE. BUT CHALLENGE

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.608
BEEN IN TWENTY TWO ONE. WITH IT

00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:06.176
WITH THE BY CUTS THREE HUNDRED

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:08.345
DOLLARS- WE ARE. VERY

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:10.080
OPTIMISTIC OF COURSE THAT ALL

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:12.116
OF WHAT WE GOT IN IN IN TERMS

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:13.884

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:22.092
INITIATIVE SORTS OUT OF POCKETS

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:23.894
OF FUNDING IS GOING TO PAY

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:25.095
DIVIDENDS OVER THE LONG HAUL

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:25.996
THE ONE THING THAT WE ARE

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.831
CONCERNED ABOUT IS IF THAT

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:29.933
RESTORATION DOES NOT OCCUR- AND

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.736
IF AGAIN IN IN TWENTY TWO.

00:44:32.803 --> 00:44:33.237
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IF

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:34.304
THERE'S SAY THE LANDING POINT

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:36.440
IS ONLY THAT ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:37.875
POINT FIVE. WE DO FEEL LIKE

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:39.143
THAT SOMETHING THAT IS THAT WE

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:40.978
WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY ONE OTHER

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:41.745
THING THAT WOULD MAKE WANT TO

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:43.047
MENTION AND IT GOES BACK TO

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:44.081
ISSUE NUMBER ONE BUT IT IS

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.849
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT. IS THAT

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:47.584
THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ONLY

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:49.653
AVAILABLE FOR ONE YEAR. BOTH

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.088
THAT MONEY THAT WAS WAS ADDED

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:53.824
BY CURES ACT BACK IN- MARCH

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:55.759
APRIL TIME FRAME AS WELL AS

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.761
THIS NEW TRUNCHEON MONEY. ADDED

00:44:57.828 --> 00:45:00.330
BY THE CURSOR APPROPRIATION IN

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:02.599
DECEMBER SO IT'S REALLY

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:03.434
IMPORTANT THAT IN ORDER TO

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.269
SUSTAIN. THE GRADUATION IT

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:07.037
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE

00:45:07.104 --> 00:45:08.839
TO MARCH FORWARD WITH EVEN

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.107
BETTER GRADUATION RATES AND

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:11.842
BETTER SUPPORT OF STUDENTS.

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:14.545
THAT WE DON'T FALSELY COME TO

00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:15.512
THE CONCLUSION THAT FEDERAL

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:16.647
FUNDING WILL SUPPORT THE

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.449
UNIVERSITY LONGER TERM WHAT

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:20.584

SERVICES TO STUDENTS. AND THEN

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.630
LET ME COMMENT ON YOUR ANSWER

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:34.698
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE FIRST

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:37.234

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:46.510
FUNDING IT TO PASS LEVEL OVER

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:47.911
TIME THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:50.247

DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS IN VERY

00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:35.786
SHORT ORDER THAT CAME THROUGH

LEVEL- WE APPROACH THAT AND AT

00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:48.165
THE TIME WAS OF THE ESSENCE AS

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:50.133
IT IS A CONTINUES TO BE TODAY

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.969
AND ENSURING THAT STUDENTS AND

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:52.936
FAMILIES HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:54.571
THAT THEY NEED. TO CONTINUE

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:56.707
THEIR EDUCATION WE APPROACH

00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.675
THAT IN A THREE PHASE OR THREE

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.143
TIERED PROCESS WORKING WITH OUR

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.512
CAMPUSES WHERE- WE LOOKED AT

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:04.081
DOCUMENTED NEED TO THAT

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:06.116
STUDENTS HAD EVEN PRE PANDEMIC.

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:07.985
AND PRIORITIZING THE STUDENTS

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.353
WITH THE GREATEST NEED FOR

00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:11.388
EXAMPLE THOSE WITH ZERO

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:13.457
ESTIMATED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:15.459
TO RECEIVE OF THE LARGER SHARE

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:16.793
A SECOND WAVE WAS FOR THOSE

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.995
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES KIND OF

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:19.563
AND THEN IN THE MID TIER WITH

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.398
SOME NEED. AND THEN THE THIRD

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:22.733
WORK WORK FOR STUDENTS AND

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.401
FAMILIES THAT PERHAPS PRE

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:31.441
GIVEN THE IMPACT OF THE

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:32.909

THAT EXPERIENCE AND LEARNING I

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:39.349
THINK WE WOULD TAKE A SIMILAR

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.184

THESE PROJECTS ARE FOR ENERGY

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:36.553

EFFICIENCY PROJECTS ARE

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:41.457

FUTURE YEARS OF THAT MONEY

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.162
